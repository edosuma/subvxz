00:40.273 --> 00:44.767
<i>This is Detective Jack Mosley.</i>
<i>Shield number 227.</i>

00:44.944 --> 00:48.141
<i>I guess this will be</i>
<i>my last will and testament.</i>

00:48.314 --> 00:50.373
<i>This is for Diane.</i>

00:51.818 --> 00:55.413
<i>When this day is over, they're gonna come</i>
<i>and talk to you about this...</i>

00:55.588 --> 00:59.786
<i>... and they're gonna</i>... <i>They're gonna</i>
<i>tell you what happened, Diane.</i>

00:59.959 --> 01:03.053
<i>But what they tell you</i>
<i>is not really what happened here.</i>

01:04.263 --> 01:06.198
<i>So I hope that you get this.</i>

01:08.935 --> 01:11.995
<i>I was trying to do a good thing.</i>

01:30.790 --> 01:32.781
Police! Get down! Everybody, down!

01:32.959 --> 01:35.086
Down! Get down!

01:36.029 --> 01:38.259
Go, go, go! Come on!

01:39.365 --> 01:40.593
- Clear.
- Police. Get down.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.132
Seal it off.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.135
Agent 10-10, we're all secure.

01:46.139 --> 01:47.663
All right, we're out of here.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.331
It's clear.

01:51.044 --> 01:52.671
You smell that?

02:01.888 --> 02:05.051
Couple hours. We gotta move now.
Would you turn that thing off?

02:05.225 --> 02:07.489
All right, who's downstairs
we don't need?

02:25.245 --> 02:27.304
Lt's all yours. Good luck.

02:28.681 --> 02:32.310
I hate to do this, Jack, but I need you
to sit on this until uniforms get here.

02:32.485 --> 02:34.817
- All right.
- Just hang until you're relieved.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.478
All right.

02:36.923 --> 02:38.982
Don't touch anything.

03:47.594 --> 03:49.824
Any word on the suspects?

03:58.538 --> 04:01.234
- What do you want me to tell you?
- What did you tell them?

04:01.407 --> 04:03.500
I saw someone out there.

04:04.377 --> 04:05.605
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

04:13.052 --> 04:15.748
- Anything for me?
- Breath mints.

04:15.922 --> 04:19.824
Sergeant Cannova called.
Wants you to write up this wire request.

04:19.993 --> 04:22.427
Said to make sure
you get the right dates on them.

04:22.595 --> 04:26.190
The particulars are on your desk,
and he needs it by tonight.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.227
All right.

04:30.670 --> 04:34.834
All right, well, we can have an officer
come by about 8 a.m. Tomorrow.

04:44.984 --> 04:46.747
You gave her two?

04:55.161 --> 04:57.356
Well, you know, we do what we can.

05:00.933 --> 05:03.993
Hey, Jack, I forgot to tell you,
the lieutenant's looking for you.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.138
He wants you to find him right away.

05:06.606 --> 05:08.767
Yeah, yeah.

05:09.375 --> 05:11.639
Well, listen.
All right, well, I'll call you.

05:15.782 --> 05:17.374
Hey, Mosley.

05:18.685 --> 05:20.175
- Mosley.
- Yeah.

05:20.353 --> 05:22.287
Grace tell you to find me?

05:22.989 --> 05:26.425
- Yeah, just a minute ago.
- All right, need a favor.

05:26.592 --> 05:29.220
Get this guy from lockup
and run him to Centre Street.

05:29.395 --> 05:33.126
The DA needs him ASAP. He's gotta be
in front of a grand jury before 10.

05:34.267 --> 05:35.894
I signed out.

05:36.569 --> 05:37.797
You signed the sheet?

05:38.738 --> 05:41.502
Well, not technically, no.
But I mean, I'm signed out.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.266
Then consider yourself on overtime.

05:43.443 --> 05:45.741
Captain Gruber called.
We need this thing done.

05:45.912 --> 05:48.073
Don't you got some mutt
that takes care of this?

05:48.247 --> 05:51.978
I got Keenan, but he's still on the Verrazano.
He's behind some overturned truck.

05:56.556 --> 06:00.253
I'm tired. I mean, look, normally,
you know me, I don't say no.

06:00.426 --> 06:02.417
I know you been
working all night, Jack...

06:02.595 --> 06:05.189
..but who's the detective
and who's the lieutenant here?

06:05.365 --> 06:07.629
I mean, Jack, I got nobody else.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.734
It's a nothing thing.

06:09.902 --> 06:13.360
One hundred and eighteen minutes
to get a little hemorrhoid 16 blocks.

06:15.575 --> 06:18.408
I'll let you come in
to work late tomorrow.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.269
Yeah, yeah.

06:49.342 --> 06:50.934
Edward Bunker.

06:51.110 --> 06:53.601
Yeah, that's me, officer.
Eddie Bunker, right here.

06:53.780 --> 06:54.940
Down here, the last cell.

06:55.114 --> 06:57.776
- Come back in an hour.
- What do you mean, come back?

06:57.950 --> 07:00.077
He's supposed to wear a suit
when he leaves.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.551
- And?
- It's not here yet.

07:02.722 --> 07:05.122
Just get him out here, all right?

07:05.291 --> 07:07.020
They said he'd wear a suit.

07:07.193 --> 07:11.095
No, yeah, I'm supposed to get a suit.
It's a three-piece suit. It's gray.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.663
It's got... Wait. Yeah.

07:12.832 --> 07:15.824
It's a three-button, it's gray,
it's got cuffs on the pants.

07:16.002 --> 07:18.835
They brought the catalog down.
I picked it out of the catalog.

07:19.005 --> 07:20.973
I'm not supposed
to leave without it. Wait.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.233
I'm not supposed to leave
without that suit.

07:23.409 --> 07:27.072
- You tell it to him.
- No, that's why you brought my shoelaces.

07:27.246 --> 07:29.043
- Come on, come on.
- I'm not supposed to.

07:29.215 --> 07:32.184
- Yo, yo, you take the old lady, right?
- Yeah, you sure?

07:32.351 --> 07:34.683
The old lady goes into the car,
otherwise she dies.

07:34.854 --> 07:36.082
- You think so?
- Yeah, man.

07:36.255 --> 07:40.021
That's what... I don't know. You gotta
figure out the answer for yourself.

07:40.193 --> 07:43.856
Everybody just calm down.
Officer, I'm going to court.

07:44.030 --> 07:45.657
- I'm supposed to have a suit.
- Hey.

07:45.832 --> 07:48.027
Shut up. Here's your property.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.465
- It's not a good sign.
- Hands behind your back.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.797
- Hold on, I'm trying...
- Hands behind your back.

07:52.972 --> 07:57.204
I don't even have my...
All my prop... Wait one minute.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.336
It's not right.
They promised me the suit.

08:00.513 --> 08:02.640
I picked it out of the catalog...
Wait, my book.

08:02.815 --> 08:05.909
I can't leave without my book.
My book is very important to me.

08:06.385 --> 08:09.115
Why are we rushing like this?
Lt's not a good sign.

08:09.288 --> 08:11.313
- Hey.
- What's the damn answer?

08:11.491 --> 08:13.857
- Hey!
- Shut up.

08:14.627 --> 08:17.494
- I hate police.
- Half a tank.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.295
You could have had
a little more patience.

08:24.470 --> 08:27.837
This suit don't mean nothing to you.
You probably got a bunch of suits.

08:28.007 --> 08:30.703
But it's a whole different thing to me.

08:42.889 --> 08:45.016
These cars don't ever change, huh?

08:45.758 --> 08:48.249
Traditional cruisers.

08:48.427 --> 08:51.396
And the same retarded hump
in the middle.

08:51.697 --> 08:55.861
Smell the same way,
like Lysol and vomit.

08:56.836 --> 09:00.169
I hope nobody vomited back here.
They probably did.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.577
Hey, man, let me ask you something.

09:11.817 --> 09:14.081
I'm trying to figure this out.

09:14.520 --> 09:17.284
You driving along
in your hurricane, right?

09:17.456 --> 09:19.822
There's three people at the bus stop.

09:19.992 --> 09:23.018
Yeah, one is an old lady.
She's sick, she about to die.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.790
The second one is your best friend.

09:26.966 --> 09:29.093
He saved your life, right?

09:29.268 --> 09:32.635
And the third is the girl of your dreams.

09:32.805 --> 09:34.796
Right, but check it out...

09:35.308 --> 09:39.267
..you only got space in the car
for one person.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.480
Right? Who you take?

09:42.648 --> 09:45.845
Lt's a riddle that's supposed to tell
what type of person you are...

09:46.018 --> 09:47.610
..like where you at in your life.

09:47.787 --> 09:50.347
It's a hypothetical question, man, damn.

09:50.523 --> 09:52.855
It's just a hypothetical...

09:53.025 --> 09:56.654
Well, good. Fine, good.
I guess that's my answer.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.599
Why don't you get
on the loudspeaker?

10:07.773 --> 10:10.640
Put the <i>Hawaii Five-0</i> light on
or something.

10:10.810 --> 10:13.938
Use your police power.
Put on a little siren.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.910
Make room, make a hole.

10:16.082 --> 10:18.949
Isn't that the saying,
"Make a hole, make a hole"?

10:20.252 --> 10:22.243
Go on, make a hole.

10:26.325 --> 10:31.092
Signs. Everywhere, signs, signs, signs.
All over, man.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.758
I used to not even see
nothing like that, man.

10:33.933 --> 10:38.370
And then I start seeing them.
And I start looking for them.

10:38.738 --> 10:40.968
And everything just start falling in place.

10:42.808 --> 10:46.209
I'm gonna be all right,
where I'm supposed to be.

10:46.746 --> 10:50.409
I ain't got my suit,
but once they get my testimony...

10:50.583 --> 10:52.949
..they drop my charges, I'm free.

10:53.119 --> 10:54.552
It's making sense to me.

10:55.054 --> 10:56.885
I believe in that.

10:57.056 --> 10:58.717
Being in the right place.

10:58.891 --> 11:01.724
Being where you supposed to be.
You believe in that?

11:01.894 --> 11:04.886
I believe life's too long
and guys like you make it even longer.

11:07.733 --> 11:09.200
Life's too long?

11:10.970 --> 11:12.232
Damn.

11:13.639 --> 11:17.336
That's some cold shit, man. I ain't never
heard nobody say no shit like that.

11:17.510 --> 11:21.640
Usually you hear about people
trying to make their life longer, you know?

11:21.814 --> 11:25.375
Trying to stay alive a little longer.
You sound a little...

11:25.551 --> 11:27.849
..depressed or something, you all right?

11:31.824 --> 11:33.314
You stopping?

11:33.959 --> 11:36.086
This ain't the courthouse, man.
What you doing?

11:37.797 --> 11:39.321
Yo.

11:40.299 --> 11:41.891
Yo, why you stopping?

11:42.068 --> 11:45.401
You gonna rush me out to court,
and now you stopping? What are you...?

11:45.571 --> 11:47.732
Hey. Hey, man.

11:47.907 --> 11:52.708
Hey, man. Listen, man, I got an important
appointment after my court date, man.

11:53.345 --> 11:56.644
That shit ain't funny, man.
Come on, man. It's not a game, man.

11:56.816 --> 11:58.374
Yo.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.243
Some bullshit, man.

12:01.987 --> 12:05.218
Hey. Hey!

12:05.891 --> 12:08.951
No, man. It ain't Miller Time, man.

12:13.532 --> 12:17.195
<i>The weather will be clear early morning,</i>
<i>but the rest of the day...</i>

12:17.369 --> 12:19.269
Sam. Hey, Angela.

12:20.372 --> 12:22.840
<i>So we are looking at a hot, humid day.</i>

12:23.008 --> 12:25.272
<i>Looks like temperature</i>
<i>might reach 100 degrees...</i>

12:25.444 --> 12:27.344
<i>... so don't forget</i>
<i>to pack your sunscreen.</i>

12:27.513 --> 12:29.208
Add a pack of these, will you?

12:29.381 --> 12:32.908
I know this dude smelled funny.
I got the wrong dude, man.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.051
17.50. What?

12:36.222 --> 12:39.521
Hey, don't open it. Come over here.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.390
What time is it, man?

12:42.561 --> 12:44.324
Lt's 8:11.

12:47.566 --> 12:49.796
That's a good sign. That's a good sign.

12:49.969 --> 12:51.766
I'm on my way. I'm gonna get there.

12:54.874 --> 12:57.035
- Want change?
- No, you keep the change.

12:57.209 --> 12:59.700
Keep the change.
All right, you have a good day.

12:59.879 --> 13:02.177
- I don't want the peanuts.
- Bye.

13:02.648 --> 13:04.775
No, man. Can't do nothing for you,
understand?

13:04.950 --> 13:08.511
Hey, you better give me that change.
I'm gonna need that.

13:08.687 --> 13:10.245
You see my situation right here?

13:10.422 --> 13:11.787
No, no, no! No, no, no!

13:48.794 --> 13:50.091
Hey!

14:33.072 --> 14:35.006
How am I supposed to get out?

14:36.508 --> 14:37.998
- Come on.
- Help me. Help me.

14:41.914 --> 14:46.851
- My book. Why did you stop?
- Go, left, go. Left.

14:47.019 --> 14:49.886
Move. Move. Move.

14:50.055 --> 14:52.717
Wait. Freeze!

14:52.892 --> 14:55.156
In here. Come on.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.390
Shit.

15:02.534 --> 15:03.523
Hey!

15:04.703 --> 15:06.762
Just get out of here, now!
Go on. Go!

15:08.307 --> 15:10.935
Come on, let's go.
That way, let's go. Go, go.

15:19.351 --> 15:20.579
Ready? Here.

15:25.791 --> 15:27.816
Let's go. Go.

15:28.661 --> 15:32.256
- Dominic, get people out of here, right now.
- Jesus, Jackie. What's going on?

15:32.431 --> 15:34.729
- Everybody. You too.
- All right, okay.

15:36.568 --> 15:38.536
- Let's go.
- Come on, come on, come on.

15:40.472 --> 15:42.201
Hey, yo.

15:45.144 --> 15:48.341
Come on, keep going. Come on.
Come on, move it.

15:49.081 --> 15:54.018
Yeah, this is Detective Jack Mosley,
shield number 227.

15:54.186 --> 15:57.451
I am 10-13, at... Hold on a minute.

15:57.623 --> 16:01.616
- Dominic, what's the address here?
- 133 Mulberry.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.694
133 Mulberry.

16:05.431 --> 16:07.456
Mulberry Street.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.533
All right.

16:19.745 --> 16:20.973
Is they coming?

16:25.851 --> 16:28.581
I don't know why you stopped, man.

16:29.088 --> 16:31.886
I don't know why
you would do that, man.

16:34.626 --> 16:35.854
They said you were nobody.

16:36.028 --> 16:38.758
- I ain't nobody.
- Shut up.

16:38.931 --> 16:41.900
You a wino. You need to stop drinking,
that's what you need.

16:42.067 --> 16:45.230
Shut up.

16:56.281 --> 16:57.714
Jack?

16:59.752 --> 17:01.583
- Frank.
- Hey.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.615
You all right?

17:04.857 --> 17:06.347
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

17:07.593 --> 17:10.323
We were on Mott when the call went out.
Heard it was you.

17:11.262 --> 17:12.594
Got here as soon as we could.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.733
Oh, hi.

17:19.471 --> 17:21.439
- Hey.
- You all right?

17:21.607 --> 17:24.075
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- You having fun?

17:25.176 --> 17:27.202
- No.
- No? Oh, well.

17:27.679 --> 17:29.544
Gotta have fun.

17:33.852 --> 17:37.253
- What's up, Jack?
- Hey, man. Hi.

17:38.357 --> 17:42.555
You did a really great, great job, man.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.923
You got yourself a bad guy.

17:45.864 --> 17:48.458
Been a while, huh? Yeah.

17:48.634 --> 17:53.799
We got the second shooter
half a block from here, so it's done.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.441
- Sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

17:58.610 --> 18:02.068
I'm just getting my wind. I was running.

18:02.648 --> 18:04.616
Why don't you let us take it from here.

18:04.783 --> 18:07.081
Oh, yeah.

18:07.252 --> 18:11.814
We'll get the kid where he belongs,
and you don't have to worry about a thing.

18:12.224 --> 18:14.215
- We'll get you home.
- Yes, please.

18:14.393 --> 18:16.953
Please, please, officer.
That's a very good idea...

18:17.129 --> 18:20.064
..because, honestly, I don't think
this dude is doing too good.

18:20.232 --> 18:21.460
I told him not to stop.

18:21.633 --> 18:24.124
I asked him not to stop.
He just had to stop.

18:24.303 --> 18:26.999
That's when everything happened.
Dude came to the window.

18:27.172 --> 18:29.663
I have a very important
appointment aft...

18:29.842 --> 18:31.275
Jack.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.642
Hey, Shue.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.345
Come on. Here.

18:44.523 --> 18:46.047
Why don't you take this. Come on.

18:46.225 --> 18:48.819
We'll get you out of here.
Got a car waiting. All right?

18:48.994 --> 18:50.427
Get some sleep.

18:53.899 --> 18:55.423
Jack?

19:26.064 --> 19:29.864
The kid was gonna testify against Jerry.

19:30.869 --> 19:34.032
He saw Jerry doing some business.

19:34.873 --> 19:39.071
Now, we both know that Jerry has never
been a standup guy like you and me.

19:40.612 --> 19:45.072
He'll roll over, they indict him.
We can't have that.

19:45.250 --> 19:48.845
No. It's gonna hurt a lot of us.

19:51.823 --> 19:53.222
Come on.

20:03.068 --> 20:07.732
See, this whole thing caught us...
It caught us completely unaware.

20:11.009 --> 20:13.807
It was supposed to be
Teach's nephew driving him.

20:13.979 --> 20:17.506
But he got stuck out there in traffic,
who knows where...

20:18.650 --> 20:20.675
..so then your lieutenant, he pegged you.

20:22.387 --> 20:26.915
You know, just the wrong time
and the wrong place for you today.

20:28.427 --> 20:33.694
All right. Now, you know that I would never
put you in a position like this, right?

20:33.865 --> 20:35.890
You know that, huh?

20:36.068 --> 20:39.094
And I never figured
you'd cap one of those guys.

20:39.571 --> 20:42.836
- That's what I get for hiring drug addicts.
- Grab the gun.

20:45.344 --> 20:48.905
Grab the gun. There you go.

20:50.282 --> 20:51.408
Come on. Frank?

20:52.985 --> 20:55.647
- Here we go.
- All right, here we go. Jack.

20:56.755 --> 20:58.120
Squeeze the trigger.

21:01.360 --> 21:06.059
All right. Let go of the gun.
Let go of the gun.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.600
I figure it like this.

21:12.437 --> 21:16.635
You... You pop the guys
trying to spring the kid.

21:16.808 --> 21:19.572
The kid, well, he gets your gun.

21:20.345 --> 21:22.370
And he takes you hostage.

21:22.547 --> 21:25.983
So we came in and saved the day.

21:26.151 --> 21:28.449
He died, you lived.

21:29.821 --> 21:32.915
Now, this could be a good thing
for you, Jack.

21:35.260 --> 21:37.490
Get you back where you belong.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.299
- Are you still with?
- Stand up.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.873
- You still with what's-her-name?
- Come on, stand up.

21:51.843 --> 21:54.334
- What are you waiting for?
- What's her name?

22:10.896 --> 22:12.625
Caroline.

22:13.699 --> 22:15.496
It's Caroline.

22:17.602 --> 22:19.695
This changes everything, Jack.

22:23.041 --> 22:24.531
Over here.

22:29.481 --> 22:31.108
Come on, Frank.

22:35.721 --> 22:39.657
Kid, get up. Come on.

22:45.297 --> 22:47.595
Shit. Man, shit.

22:51.670 --> 22:55.663
All right, Jack, it's 8:25.

22:56.475 --> 23:00.571
- You stay there.
- Listen to me, the jury's tenure ends at 10.

23:00.746 --> 23:04.443
All right? The kid gets there
one minute past, all this...

23:07.753 --> 23:09.482
..it doesn't matter.

23:11.022 --> 23:13.422
And all you gotta do
is look the other way.

23:13.592 --> 23:15.526
All right? We still got options here.

23:15.694 --> 23:16.991
Okay?

23:17.162 --> 23:18.390
We just want the kid.

23:20.866 --> 23:24.063
Jack, Jack, Jack,
just let me help you.

23:24.569 --> 23:25.763
All right?

23:25.937 --> 23:27.564
Back up.

23:30.375 --> 23:33.833
Jack, once you go out that door...

23:34.146 --> 23:35.977
..I can't help you.

23:36.148 --> 23:39.276
Please just back up, Frank.
Just back up.

23:59.404 --> 24:00.962
He shot a cop.

24:01.239 --> 24:03.833
What the hell did you see?
What did you see?

24:04.009 --> 24:05.772
That cop back there.

24:05.944 --> 24:07.571
I seen him around my way...

24:07.746 --> 24:10.772
..holding a gun in this
little Puerto Rican kid's mouth.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.746
Come on. Let's go.

24:12.918 --> 24:16.012
He said he'd kill his mother
if he testified.

24:17.022 --> 24:19.115
What you doing that for?
We need that.

24:19.291 --> 24:22.590
The shell in that gun was over 20 years old.
Lucky it went off at all.

24:22.761 --> 24:25.821
- They didn't tell you Shue was a cop?
- No, they didn't tell me.

24:25.997 --> 24:28.090
They showed me a picture, that was it.

24:28.266 --> 24:32.327
Well, congratulations, because you're about
to testify against one of New York's worst.

24:32.504 --> 24:34.472
- What?
- Fellas, look, the clock's ticking.

24:34.639 --> 24:37.767
He's gotta be at the courthouse by 10.
We know where he's going.

24:37.943 --> 24:40.309
Mulvey, you're coming with me.

24:40.812 --> 24:42.939
- Know where you're going?
- Take the north side.

24:43.114 --> 24:44.741
- You got it, let's go.
- Come on.

24:45.450 --> 24:48.817
- Captain.
- Where are we, Frank?

24:48.987 --> 24:51.785
Well, we're putting descriptions out
over precinct channels.

24:51.957 --> 24:56.792
No names, or that one's a cop.
It'll help to have some eyes.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.858
- How long can you sit on this?
- He shot a cop.

25:00.332 --> 25:03.324
You're the precinct captain, Dan.
How long?

25:03.502 --> 25:06.562
I don't know.
Hour, maybe a little more.

25:07.172 --> 25:08.799
- Who's on this with you?
- My guys.

25:08.974 --> 25:13.172
Ortiz and Maldonado from the 66.
Touhey and Kaller from the 111.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.370
A couple others
you don't wanna know about.

25:19.384 --> 25:22.012
The guy was your partner for 20 years.

25:22.187 --> 25:24.519
What the hell happened in there?

25:24.689 --> 25:26.953
- Is he drunk?
- I don't know.

25:27.425 --> 25:29.586
I don't know. We woke him up.

25:30.262 --> 25:33.390
Hopefully he'll do what he always does,
and we can go back to work.

25:33.565 --> 25:35.430
If he doesn't?

25:38.069 --> 25:42.438
We gotta quash this thing
before he gets his legs back.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.233
These are his streets.

25:47.979 --> 25:52.211
This could get ugly for all of us
if that kid talks.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.716
- He can't talk.
- He won't talk.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.688
Look, I appreciate
what you did for me back there...

25:57.856 --> 26:00.518
..but I'm starting to think
you're not the dude for this.

26:00.692 --> 26:03.320
I mean, you're out of breath,
you're hung-over.

26:03.495 --> 26:05.759
Your leg is gonna give out on you
any second, man.

26:05.931 --> 26:09.230
I got someplace I need to be at 12,
you understand?

26:09.401 --> 26:11.301
I need to be finished at court by 10...

26:11.469 --> 26:13.869
..or I'm not gonna get
where I'm supposed to get.

26:14.039 --> 26:16.906
- You understand what I'm saying?
- All right, I understand.

26:17.075 --> 26:20.511
- You're not listening to what I'm saying.
- Wait, come here. Come here.

26:25.216 --> 26:26.706
Come on.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.151
Hung-over.

26:30.322 --> 26:32.119
A bad leg.

26:32.290 --> 26:34.087
No gun.

26:37.762 --> 26:39.457
- Bobby?
- Yeah?

26:39.631 --> 26:42.464
- <i>You thinking what I'm thinking?</i>
- I'm already there.

27:07.092 --> 27:08.957
Oh, God.

27:12.831 --> 27:14.628
Come on, let's go.

27:14.799 --> 27:19.498
Listen, just stay put right here.
I'll be right back.

27:22.774 --> 27:25.004
Come on, man, don't take long.
We gotta go.

27:27.512 --> 27:29.104
Hurry up.

27:30.115 --> 27:33.050
- Hey, man, where your bathroom?
- What?

27:33.218 --> 27:35.083
Your bathroom. Where your bathroom at?

27:35.253 --> 27:37.448
Down at the end of the hall.

27:37.822 --> 27:39.289
Yeah.

27:41.393 --> 27:44.419
That's what you look like
when you smile, huh?

27:45.230 --> 27:47.528
You was probably drinking then too.

27:51.369 --> 27:53.337
There's the lady.

27:54.139 --> 27:57.131
Redhead. She cute. That ain't bad.

27:57.308 --> 28:00.573
Hey, man. Come on, don't be stopping
to get high or nothing like that.

28:00.745 --> 28:02.610
Man, we gotta go.

28:04.816 --> 28:07.717
Make sure you lift the seat up
before you go.

28:11.156 --> 28:12.885
It's up already.

28:15.226 --> 28:17.888
Maybe you left it like that, huh?

28:58.703 --> 29:00.295
I'm coming.

29:15.954 --> 29:17.683
Hey, Jack.

29:19.057 --> 29:20.319
Jack Mosley.

29:24.229 --> 29:25.491
Why did you do that?

29:27.031 --> 29:28.555
Do what?

29:29.033 --> 29:31.001
Shoot that cop.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.295
Cops...

29:34.572 --> 29:36.130
..they don't shoot other cops.

29:39.144 --> 29:41.476
Especially over nobody like me.

29:53.124 --> 29:56.184
It's a long way to go for a stranger,
you know.

29:57.862 --> 29:59.454
Thank you.

30:00.165 --> 30:02.463
I never had nobody...

30:02.634 --> 30:04.465
Hell, man, you know.

30:04.636 --> 30:08.231
I don't rock with the police,
you know what I'm saying?

30:08.540 --> 30:10.940
- Finger off the trigger.
- They never been my friend.

30:11.109 --> 30:12.838
- Then here you come.
- On the ground.

30:13.011 --> 30:14.911
It's kind of bugging me out, you know.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.747
You on some vigilante business.

30:18.917 --> 30:20.384
Let's go.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.179
- Jack...
- Put your arms around the pole.

30:24.355 --> 30:25.947
I don't know what to think anymore.

30:26.124 --> 30:29.423
- Here. Cuff yourself.
- What are you doing, Jack?

30:29.594 --> 30:32.586
Yeah, it's a little strange.

30:32.764 --> 30:35.232
You know? By any definition, this here.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.163
All right, kid. Good.

30:37.335 --> 30:38.893
Okay.

30:39.103 --> 30:42.766
Okay, okay, okay.

30:43.141 --> 30:44.870
Okay.

30:46.077 --> 30:47.408
Okay.

30:48.446 --> 30:51.176
You should have done
what you always do, Jack.

30:52.483 --> 30:55.884
- Where's your phone?
- It's on the left-hand side.

30:57.021 --> 30:59.751
They know I'm here.
If I don't answer it...

31:03.394 --> 31:05.362
- Jack?
- Let's go, kid. Come on.

31:19.544 --> 31:22.877
- Bob.
- <i>Bob's a little tied up right now, Frank.</i>

31:23.648 --> 31:25.172
<i>All right, I'm impressed, Jack.</i>

31:25.350 --> 31:26.476
Did you shoot him too?

31:28.720 --> 31:31.120
Send someone to check on Bobby.

31:36.394 --> 31:38.021
<i>Jack, you're not up to this.</i>

31:38.329 --> 31:40.092
<i>All right? It's gonna end bad for you.</i>

31:43.868 --> 31:46.359
You lost the kid, didn't you?

31:48.273 --> 31:50.207
<i>He bailed on you. Well, you know what?</i>

31:50.375 --> 31:52.536
<i>That is the best thing</i>
<i>that could have happened.</i>

31:52.710 --> 31:54.041
<i>So why don't you go home.</i>

31:54.212 --> 31:55.440
Forget about what happened.

31:55.613 --> 31:58.138
We'll take it from here.
Are you looking for him?

31:58.316 --> 32:00.045
<i>And you can't find him.</i>

32:00.218 --> 32:02.311
<i>We're gonna find him, all right?</i>

32:02.854 --> 32:04.082
<i>We're gonna find him.</i>

32:04.255 --> 32:06.985
All right, Jack, now you can hang up.

32:10.862 --> 32:12.727
Where are you, kid?

32:13.164 --> 32:15.724
All right. Now, let's see
which way he went.

32:15.900 --> 32:18.494
Did he go up? Did he go down?

32:18.670 --> 32:21.104
In or out, Jackie.
Which way did he go?

32:23.441 --> 32:25.841
Let's see if he went down.

32:27.545 --> 32:30.105
- Excuse me, sir, do you mind swiping?
- Get a job, man.

32:30.281 --> 32:32.010
Ma'am, would you mind swiping me in?

32:32.183 --> 32:35.175
Ma'am? Ma'am, would you mind
swiping me in, please, ma'am?

32:35.353 --> 32:38.413
I have a very important
appointment I have to...

32:40.992 --> 32:44.120
Excuse me, ma'am, would you mind...?
Somebody mind swiping me in?

32:44.295 --> 32:47.526
I'm trying to get
to an important appointment.

32:47.699 --> 32:50.361
Somebody help me. Somebody help me.

32:50.535 --> 32:52.730
Somebody help me.

32:53.237 --> 32:54.670
Hey.

32:56.674 --> 32:58.039
Come here.

32:58.876 --> 33:01.811
- Come on. Go.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

33:16.928 --> 33:18.418
Eddie!

33:18.596 --> 33:20.029
- Oh, no.
- What are you doing?

33:20.198 --> 33:22.029
- Why are you running?
- What do you want?

33:22.200 --> 33:24.464
Lt's too much, man.
I'm doing the rest on my own.

33:24.635 --> 33:26.967
I'm doing what I said.
I'm getting out of here.

33:27.138 --> 33:30.335
- Lf I can find you, they can find you!
- I'm doing what I said.

33:30.842 --> 33:33.538
Eddie, listen to me. Listen to me.
Listen to me!

33:33.711 --> 33:36.578
- I'm your only friend down here.
- No, you're not my friend.

33:36.748 --> 33:39.979
- I can do this...
- Friend? You don't even know me!

33:40.151 --> 33:42.517
And get me where?
You gonna get me shot.

33:42.787 --> 33:46.416
Ever since I've been with you, people been
trying to shoot me. People you know!

33:46.591 --> 33:49.856
Look, man, I got someplace I need to be.
I got something I need to do.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.724
Unless you gonna shoot me or arrest me,
I'm going, Jack.

33:52.897 --> 33:56.025
- I can't let you leave.
- Thank you, Jack Mosley. I'm going.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.668
- You can't leave.
- Yes, I can. Thank you, Jack Mosley.

33:58.970 --> 34:00.562
Stop. Don't do that. Stop.

34:00.738 --> 34:03.138
Ladies and gentlemen...!
You're not going. Come here.

34:03.307 --> 34:05.275
Eddie!

34:06.878 --> 34:08.708
Okay, okay.
Okay, we gotta go.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.371
- Move! Move!
- Get out of the way!

34:14.351 --> 34:16.013
Move! Move!

34:25.396 --> 34:26.987
- Here, come on.
- What are you doing?

34:27.165 --> 34:29.793
Taxi! Hey!

34:29.967 --> 34:31.831
Taxi!

34:35.639 --> 34:38.438
Lt's Kaller. He just missed them
at the Canal Street station.

34:38.775 --> 34:40.710
Where, where, where?

34:41.012 --> 34:44.038
Shit. Where the hell is he?

34:44.549 --> 34:46.414
Goddamn it.

34:46.583 --> 34:48.779
We're gonna find you.

34:48.953 --> 34:51.547
Yeah, this is Detective Nugent.
I need a triangulation...

34:51.722 --> 34:55.748
<i>... on Detective Torres' cell phone.</i>
<i>Area code (917) 935...</i>

34:59.363 --> 35:04.062
That cop back at the apartment,
he said you should do what you always do.

35:04.235 --> 35:06.897
What did he...?
What did he mean by that?

35:08.573 --> 35:11.872
You're not doing
what you always do, huh?

35:12.043 --> 35:14.841
Jack Mosley, I get it. I see the signs.

35:15.012 --> 35:18.345
I'm where I'm supposed to be.
I was wrong. You're the right guy.

35:18.516 --> 35:21.713
I could have got another guy,
did something different, but I got you.

35:21.886 --> 35:23.649
I appreciate it. You're the right guy.

35:23.821 --> 35:24.810
- Okay?
- Okay.

35:24.989 --> 35:27.480
- <i>This is Comtech, over.</i>
- Yeah, go, this is Nugent.

35:27.658 --> 35:30.752
GPS indicates they're on Bowery.

35:30.928 --> 35:32.953
<i>Repeat, Bowery,</i>
<i>moving south towards Pell.</i>

35:33.131 --> 35:34.621
<i>Speed indicates they're on foot.</i>

35:34.799 --> 35:36.892
Are you hearing this, boys?
He's in Chinatown.

35:37.268 --> 35:39.065
<i>Let's move in.</i>

35:47.712 --> 35:50.476
- What's the deal with that book?
- It's my business plans.

35:50.648 --> 35:53.412
I'm moving to Seattle.
My sister's already living out there.

35:53.584 --> 35:56.712
I'm gonna open up a bakery.
But it's only, like, a specialty bakery.

35:56.888 --> 35:59.789
Birthday cakes for little kids.
There's a lot of money in that.

35:59.957 --> 36:02.790
I'm gonna send you
a big birthday cake on your birthday...

36:02.960 --> 36:05.428
- I hate birthday cakes.
- You hate birthday cakes?

36:05.596 --> 36:07.393
First thing that doesn't go your way...

36:07.565 --> 36:10.329
..you're gonna be slipping into
Carol's Clip and Curl...

36:10.501 --> 36:12.492
..and stealing all her hair-care products.

36:12.670 --> 36:15.195
Because you're a thief.
And that's what you are, Eddie.

36:15.373 --> 36:18.809
- You're always gonna be a thief.
- People can change, Jack.

36:18.976 --> 36:21.968
- Days change, seasons change. Not people.
- Yes, you do...

36:22.146 --> 36:25.343
- People don't change, Eddie.
- Yes, you do. I'll get you that cake.

36:25.516 --> 36:27.177
You know what it's gonna say on top?

36:27.351 --> 36:31.253
"Jack Mosley, ha-ha-ha, eat this." Make you
eat your words, lick your fingers too.

36:31.422 --> 36:33.083
Subject's moving west on Pell.

36:36.327 --> 36:39.854
Subject now moving south on Doyers.
Still moving south on Doyers.

36:40.031 --> 36:43.592
Bobby, you take Doyer, we got Pell.
And, Kaller, you close up Bowery.

36:43.768 --> 36:45.167
- <i>Copy that.</i>
- Let's squeeze him.

36:45.336 --> 36:48.271
- <i>Copy that, on my way.</i>
- Why don't you pull up. Pull up.

37:31.148 --> 37:33.207
- Sorry.
- Who is that? You can't go in here.

37:33.384 --> 37:34.783
Oh, sorry.

37:54.372 --> 37:58.433
Look, man, I gotta be down there.
All right, you understand?

37:58.843 --> 38:02.711
I gotta be down there that way, and
there's streets and shit in between there.

38:02.880 --> 38:06.475
You got some sort of plan?
Some sort of police plan or something?

38:06.651 --> 38:09.449
I see your limp acting up.
You ought to get that checked out.

38:09.620 --> 38:13.249
I have a buddy of mine
walking around with a limp just like that.

38:13.424 --> 38:15.688
He don't wanna go
to the doctor, though, right?

38:15.860 --> 38:19.455
Finally he go,
they say it's a fracture, right?

38:19.630 --> 38:22.463
And now it's infected.
They gotta cut it off at the knee.

38:23.367 --> 38:25.426
Wasn't so bad, though.
He had no more pain.

38:25.603 --> 38:28.436
He ended up moving to Jersey,
working for the PATH...

38:28.606 --> 38:31.006
..being a motorman.
Got a pension and shit now.

38:31.175 --> 38:34.736
I guess everything happens for a reason,
you know what I mean?

38:34.912 --> 38:37.312
You're a sunny little shit,
I'll give you that much.

38:43.487 --> 38:45.455
Get in here! Get in that door!

38:46.290 --> 38:47.951
Jack!

38:48.459 --> 38:53.328
- Pull me in! Help me in!
- Come on, come on, come on.

38:53.497 --> 38:54.589
Lock the door.

39:00.604 --> 39:02.037
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Hold up.

39:04.141 --> 39:05.369
Come on.

39:35.940 --> 39:38.067
- You all right?
- Yeah.

39:54.792 --> 39:57.454
Jack, what are we doing?
Where are we going?

40:02.066 --> 40:05.001
- Come on.
- Where we going, Jack?

40:06.404 --> 40:07.894
Out of the way.

40:08.072 --> 40:09.505
Over here.

40:10.207 --> 40:14.507
Jack? How we even know that Centre Street
Courthouse is in this direction, Jack?

40:14.678 --> 40:16.305
Jack? We gotta know...

40:17.214 --> 40:19.182
Down! Head down!

40:20.518 --> 40:21.507
Go!

40:24.522 --> 40:26.513
Come on!

40:40.070 --> 40:41.469
Kaller!

40:43.007 --> 40:44.907
Push it.

41:16.273 --> 41:17.831
You all right, Jack?

41:22.646 --> 41:25.206
I was aiming for the kid,
if that makes you feel better.

41:25.382 --> 41:27.316
Well, you missed!

41:31.822 --> 41:34.416
That kid is gonna get you killed.

41:35.793 --> 41:37.658
He worth that?

41:44.068 --> 41:46.059
Well, I got all day.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.564
How about you, you got all day?

41:52.743 --> 41:56.076
- Jack, you still there?
- Yeah.

41:56.380 --> 41:57.779
Still here.

42:00.351 --> 42:02.251
Well, this is awkward.

42:07.191 --> 42:09.716
When I started this day...

42:10.394 --> 42:13.192
..I never figured on trading
9 mils with my friend.

42:14.431 --> 42:20.165
I think we stopped being friends
right around 8:25, in that bar.

42:21.005 --> 42:22.495
No.

42:23.340 --> 42:28.277
No, that's not gonna erase
20 years together.

42:28.512 --> 42:29.877
We're still friends.

42:34.518 --> 42:36.383
Look...

42:36.921 --> 42:39.719
..a lot I'd take back, but I can't.

42:40.324 --> 42:44.693
Well, so you move forward.
Next day, next case.

42:45.863 --> 42:47.956
- Lines were crossed.
- What lines?

42:48.132 --> 42:53.365
- You hear me? Lines were crossed, Frank.
- What lines? There are no lines!

42:53.704 --> 42:56.264
There's getting it done
and not getting it done, period!

42:56.974 --> 43:00.535
You put the bad guys away
no matter what it takes.

43:00.711 --> 43:03.236
Now, you're gonna ruin the lives...

43:03.781 --> 43:05.908
..of six cops.

43:06.984 --> 43:08.679
Good cops.

43:08.852 --> 43:10.649
Good men.

43:13.791 --> 43:18.751
Are you ready to sacrifice
their lives for that kid?

43:19.797 --> 43:21.731
Hey, Frank.

43:22.032 --> 43:23.897
- Frank.
- Yeah?

43:24.068 --> 43:27.401
This is not about me
ruining anybody's life.

43:27.571 --> 43:29.835
Okay? This is about you.

43:30.975 --> 43:32.670
You hear me?

43:33.677 --> 43:35.269
Yeah.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.275
You look at that kid's jacket?

43:39.817 --> 43:41.444
I did.

43:41.652 --> 43:45.019
- Armed robbery, assault, beats old women...
- I never had no armed robbery!

43:45.189 --> 43:48.317
Beats old women over the heads,
steals their Social Security checks.

43:48.492 --> 43:51.484
- One time, I used...
- Shut up. Shut up.

43:51.662 --> 43:53.527
Oh, no, don't tell him to shut up.

43:53.697 --> 43:58.896
No, Jack, listen to him.
No, that kid, he's sharp.

43:59.069 --> 44:00.331
Yeah, he's playing you.

44:02.406 --> 44:04.601
He's sharper than you are.

44:05.342 --> 44:07.435
He's telling you stories, right?

44:08.112 --> 44:10.444
He wants to be a good citizen.

44:11.782 --> 44:13.010
Go to church.

44:13.617 --> 44:15.642
Buy his mother a house.

44:15.819 --> 44:19.687
But he has spent
more than half his life in prison.

44:21.725 --> 44:26.958
Two hours ago, he was sitting in a cell
for weapons possession.

44:27.131 --> 44:29.929
- He's always gonna do what he has done.
- I wasn't...

44:30.100 --> 44:33.536
He is a career criminal.
That's who you're protecting.

44:35.439 --> 44:38.875
- You all right?
- Yeah. Frank's got him on the other side.

44:39.576 --> 44:40.873
He's got my gun too.

44:41.278 --> 44:43.337
Now, if you can't see
how wrong this is...

44:43.514 --> 44:46.506
..I promise you
I will speak from my heart...

44:47.551 --> 44:50.019
..when I give the eulogy at your funeral.

44:51.188 --> 44:52.883
So...

44:54.124 --> 44:55.819
..do you believe the kid?

44:58.629 --> 45:01.029
Or do you believe your ex-partner?

45:05.936 --> 45:08.496
Frank, we're right
on the other side of the door.

45:08.672 --> 45:10.435
Because...

45:11.809 --> 45:13.936
..if you believe the kid...

45:16.547 --> 45:18.777
..you got a choice to make.

45:26.724 --> 45:29.124
Do you go through your ex-partner?

45:31.061 --> 45:32.858
Or do you choose door number two...

45:33.263 --> 45:38.599
..and go back to where you came,
with your gimpy leg and your shot-up hand?

45:46.910 --> 45:51.244
You're not gonna get very far.
And what if your ex-partner is right, Jack?

45:52.116 --> 45:55.142
What if he is right, and you're wasting
your whole miserable life?

46:15.339 --> 46:16.567
- It's Frank.
- You all right?

46:16.740 --> 46:19.402
Yeah. They're in the elevator.
Seal the building.

46:20.144 --> 46:21.975
Come on, Bobby.
Come on, get on that.

46:22.780 --> 46:24.145
Everybody out! Police!

46:25.282 --> 46:29.514
Everybody out! Police!
Move, move! Police!

46:30.687 --> 46:33.656
- Frank, where are you?
- Bobby, I'm coming up!

46:34.825 --> 46:37.953
All right. Come on, come on.
Upstairs. Seal the stairwell.

46:38.128 --> 46:40.460
- All right.
- Find the back stairs. Check the roof.

46:40.631 --> 46:42.189
- Come on, Mal! This way.
- Got you.

46:42.366 --> 46:44.732
- Maldonado, seal it up.
- Got you.

47:00.450 --> 47:03.817
Hello? Hello? Hello?

47:07.891 --> 47:11.349
- No, nothing.
- No answer. He's not there. Come on.

47:19.436 --> 47:21.870
I never open door.

47:22.039 --> 47:25.270
Please. Please, help.

47:27.678 --> 47:28.975
Come on.

47:32.850 --> 47:35.250
Jack, Jack, Jack. Thank you.

47:37.354 --> 47:39.822
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

47:39.990 --> 47:44.450
- You saw that, right? You heard him, right?
- Yeah. He never opens the door.

47:53.837 --> 47:56.806
Thank you very much, sir. Thank you.

47:57.474 --> 47:59.704
- Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
- Thank you.

47:59.877 --> 48:03.040
- You heard him, right, Jack?
- Not now, Eddie.

48:03.213 --> 48:06.376
- Keep your voice down.
- He said he never opens the door.

48:06.550 --> 48:09.041
You know what that mean, right?

48:11.588 --> 48:13.579
Not right now.
There's the signs everywhere.

48:13.757 --> 48:17.693
- Yeah, ADA MacDonald, please.
- <i>May I tell her who's calling?</i>

48:17.861 --> 48:20.295
Yeah, tell her it's the guy
that's got her witness.

48:27.237 --> 48:30.832
You're driving a car
during a hurricane.

48:31.008 --> 48:32.532
Like:

48:32.709 --> 48:34.734
A hurricane.

48:34.912 --> 48:37.972
And there's three people at a bus stop.

48:38.148 --> 48:40.616
- A old woman.
- Yeah.

48:40.784 --> 48:43.776
A friend, like my friend here.

48:44.187 --> 48:47.156
Him. He save your life, your friend.

48:47.591 --> 48:50.424
It's Detective Mosley for you.

48:50.594 --> 48:51.754
- Mosley?
- Yeah?

48:51.929 --> 48:53.726
Where are you?
Where's my witness?

48:53.897 --> 48:55.660
I'm about seven blocks from you.

48:55.832 --> 48:58.164
But there's about a ton of cops
between me and you.

48:58.335 --> 49:00.064
And they all want this kid dead.

49:00.237 --> 49:02.728
Not to mention that
you got a leak in your office.

49:02.906 --> 49:06.000
- Somebody's talking to these cops.
- Shit.

49:06.176 --> 49:08.838
What did you think was gonna happen
when you pinched Shue?

49:09.012 --> 49:11.480
You thought they'd just lay down
and go away quietly?

49:11.648 --> 49:14.242
We thought if we went to the grand jury,
Shue would fold.

49:14.418 --> 49:15.646
He bent but didn't break.

49:15.819 --> 49:19.311
<i>We were gonna throw it away until</i>
<i>we ran into Edward Bunker last night.</i>

49:19.756 --> 49:23.954
Jury's tenure ends at 10. Without that kid,
they'll vote no bill and it all goes away.

49:24.127 --> 49:26.357
<i>He's an eyewitness.</i>
<i>He makes this work.</i>

49:26.530 --> 49:29.260
Where are you? I'll send my squad.
Richard, pen.

49:47.484 --> 49:48.781
What room?

49:54.191 --> 49:58.389
- So, what, are they coming?
- Yeah, they're coming.

49:58.762 --> 50:03.995
Good. Because I gotta be somewhere, man.
I got something to do.

50:04.167 --> 50:07.398
I gotta be someplace by noon.
I gotta go get something.

50:07.571 --> 50:09.505
It's real important.

50:10.140 --> 50:11.232
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

50:12.142 --> 50:14.508
Ortiz, I'm coming in the building.

50:16.146 --> 50:17.738
Frank?

50:20.817 --> 50:24.981
- Touhey and Kaller are taken care of.
- Good. Find Bobby. He's on the back stairs.

50:25.155 --> 50:27.885
Eddie, come here, put this on.
Here, come on, put that on.

50:28.058 --> 50:31.516
But it's a big, hot, wool shirt.
It's hot. It's summer.

50:31.695 --> 50:34.323
- You're dressed like a criminal.
- Oh, you want me to...?

50:34.498 --> 50:37.558
You want me to change my...?
I get it. But why can't I put that on?

50:37.734 --> 50:39.326
- What about this?
- What about that?

50:39.503 --> 50:42.768
- What's wrong with this? Lt's just a pattern.
- He don't even wear that.

50:42.939 --> 50:44.270
Just put the... Here.

50:44.608 --> 50:46.200
Never mind. What about this?

50:46.376 --> 50:50.540
Ls this all right? Mass-transit blue?

50:55.052 --> 50:57.520
When I was locked up,
they had me work in the kitchen.

50:57.687 --> 51:00.121
So one day a little dude
walk up to me and say:

51:00.290 --> 51:02.258
"Hey, you think
you could bake me a cake?"

51:02.426 --> 51:04.189
I said, "Yeah, I'll bake you a cake."

51:04.361 --> 51:07.421
I ain't tell him I ain't never
baked a cake, you know.

51:07.597 --> 51:09.121
But I ain't got shit else to do.

51:09.299 --> 51:13.235
So, you know, I read the instructions...

51:13.403 --> 51:16.167
..I bake him a cake, you know,
for his daughter's birthday.

51:16.339 --> 51:18.068
She'd come up there to visit him.

51:18.241 --> 51:22.234
You know, it say,
"Happy Birthday, Angel," right?

51:22.846 --> 51:25.576
He go crazy.
He can't get enough, you know.

51:25.749 --> 51:29.276
He said, "Eddie, you done hooked me up.
Man, you the man."

51:29.453 --> 51:31.944
And I started doing that.
It was good. I had a skill.

51:32.122 --> 51:34.283
People look at me different.
They would start...

51:34.458 --> 51:36.551
- You missed a button.
- Did I?

51:36.726 --> 51:38.819
Your buttons are all crooked.

51:38.995 --> 51:41.361
- Come on. Come on, man.
- All right.

51:42.165 --> 51:43.860
Nugent.

51:46.636 --> 51:48.467
You're a prince.

51:51.074 --> 51:54.305
- <i>The word is 5E, boys, 5E.</i>
- Got it.

51:57.314 --> 51:59.839
Then I start doing my research,
doing my due diligence.

52:00.016 --> 52:04.112
I found out, you know, it's good money
in birthday cakes for kids, you know.

52:04.454 --> 52:09.721
That type of thing, like Tweety Bird
or Bugs Bunny or something like that.

52:09.893 --> 52:11.952
Or <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i>.
You ever heard of <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> ?

52:13.063 --> 52:17.022
- <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i>.
- <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i>. Kids love that, man.

52:21.671 --> 52:24.936
You don't know <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> ?
You gotta get out more. <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> hot.

52:25.108 --> 52:26.336
Know what I'm saying?

52:31.181 --> 52:35.015
I'm gonna make money, Jack.
Open up my bakery.

52:35.185 --> 52:39.178
You gonna eat your words about me, Jack.
How do I look? Do I look all right?

52:39.356 --> 52:42.655
- All right.
- Freeze! Police!

52:42.826 --> 52:45.158
- Police! Police!
- Shut up!

52:45.328 --> 52:46.852
- Oh, my God!
- Shut up!

52:48.231 --> 52:50.324
Frank, they gave us
the wrong apartment.

52:54.504 --> 52:56.028
Put it down.

52:57.440 --> 52:59.374
Put it down.

53:04.428 --> 53:05.861
Can't get lucky all the time.

53:06.296 --> 53:08.127
You can be smart every day, though.

53:11.034 --> 53:14.026
- All right, give me the gun.
- Hold on.

53:14.204 --> 53:16.069
What are you doing?

53:21.712 --> 53:23.577
This place is crawling with cops, Eddie.

53:24.281 --> 53:26.511
Hey, look at me.

53:28.318 --> 53:31.378
Eddie, what are you doing?

53:31.688 --> 53:34.156
How does it feel?

53:37.527 --> 53:38.994
How does it feel?

53:39.496 --> 53:41.487
You're a baker, right?

53:42.499 --> 53:45.662
Eddie, listen to him.

53:45.969 --> 53:47.960
Pull that trigger,
you go to jail for life.

53:48.939 --> 53:50.338
<i>Frank, we're on our way down.</i>

53:51.708 --> 53:54.074
<i>Frank, do you read me?</i>

53:57.781 --> 53:59.942
- You can't stop me, you understand?
- Time to go.

54:00.117 --> 54:03.052
- Time to go.
- You can't stop me.

54:05.255 --> 54:07.450
You gave him a loaded weapon?

54:11.561 --> 54:13.358
- Frank.
- Bobby, get these things off me.

54:13.530 --> 54:16.124
- Did he take your gun?
- They went south. Get out of here.

54:16.299 --> 54:20.599
Ortiz! Ortiz, give me a piece.
Give me a piece! Get over here.

54:25.075 --> 54:27.407
Make a hole, make a hole.
Come on, make a hole.

54:40.490 --> 54:43.186
Speak to me.
Come on, somebody, speak to me.

54:46.496 --> 54:47.963
Turn.

54:56.173 --> 54:57.970
- Excuse me!
- Open up!

54:58.975 --> 55:01.341
- Excuse me!
- Open up!

55:02.179 --> 55:04.204
Keep moving. Go.
Go, go, go.

55:06.583 --> 55:07.811
Oh, shit.

55:10.821 --> 55:13.119
On the bus! Let's go.

55:18.562 --> 55:20.359
- Just keep driving.
- What are you doing?

55:20.530 --> 55:23.988
- I'm a cop. Lock the back door.
- He's got a gun!

55:25.502 --> 55:28.198
No stops.
Tell them to hang on to something, Eddie!

55:28.371 --> 55:32.467
Hang on! Don't worry, this man,
he's a police officer.

55:32.642 --> 55:34.667
- Everything is gonna be fine.
- Hang on!

55:34.845 --> 55:36.676
Everybody just hang on. Don't worry!

55:45.689 --> 55:47.281
Right, right, right! Go right!

55:52.295 --> 55:54.525
- What are you doing?
- Stop this thing!

56:06.710 --> 56:08.337
Get down!

56:35.071 --> 56:38.040
Get away from the bus!
Away from the bus!

56:40.777 --> 56:42.540
Stay down! Stay down!

56:48.752 --> 56:50.185
Heads down!

56:53.056 --> 56:55.650
- Where the hell are you?
- Construction site at Baxter.

56:55.825 --> 56:57.053
He has hostages.

57:01.531 --> 57:02.793
Let me go.

57:10.874 --> 57:12.136
Listen!

57:12.442 --> 57:15.536
Everybody, stand up.
They're not gonna shoot you.

57:15.712 --> 57:18.112
Stand up in front of the windows.

57:18.281 --> 57:20.715
They won't shoot you.
You, stay down. Stay down.

57:25.889 --> 57:28.483
Fill in the blanks. Fill in the spots.

57:28.658 --> 57:30.785
Scoot over, scoot over! That's it.

57:30.961 --> 57:33.896
- All right, get Gruber down here.
- Okay.

57:39.569 --> 57:41.059
Hey!

57:42.038 --> 57:43.596
All right, seal off that end.

57:56.453 --> 57:59.752
- It's a busload.
- Jesus, this shit just gets deeper.

57:59.923 --> 58:01.584
- Bobby?
- Gruber's on his way.

58:02.125 --> 58:05.117
All right. We gotta get
our stories straight, all right?

58:05.295 --> 58:06.922
We're getting our stories straight?

58:12.836 --> 58:14.599
Yeah, suit up.

58:25.915 --> 58:28.816
Thought we could handle this quickly
and quietly, commissioner.

58:28.985 --> 58:31.613
A guy shoots a cop,
takes a grand-jury witness hostage...

58:31.788 --> 58:33.449
..and we're supposed to make nice?

58:33.623 --> 58:37.787
Commissioner, look, sir, this is...
Watch your back, sir.

58:37.961 --> 58:39.826
This is my fault, all right?

58:39.996 --> 58:43.329
I used to work with Mosley,
so I asked the captain to let me handle it.

58:43.500 --> 58:46.992
I felt that I could bring him in.
I just didn't realize how far gone he was.

58:47.170 --> 58:50.731
- Stay on Tac 2, boys.
- Wait for command, here we go.

58:52.442 --> 58:53.909
That's it, cover them up.

58:56.346 --> 59:00.009
Good, okay. Great job. Thank you.

59:07.357 --> 59:10.121
- Commissioner, sir. Captain.
- Hi, Mike.

59:10.293 --> 59:13.262
- What do we got?
- Cop. Twenty plus, flipped.

59:13.430 --> 59:15.955
- Suicidal?
- Been to the farm twice the last four years.

59:16.132 --> 59:18.100
- Twice?
- Twice. Nothing like this, though.

59:18.268 --> 59:21.294
- What do you know, detective?
- Like the captain said, he flipped.

59:21.471 --> 59:24.872
After he nailed Shue, he started
spouting crap about making headlines.

59:25.041 --> 59:27.271
There's no way
that you're getting this guy out.

59:27.977 --> 59:31.845
<i>Please fall back behind the barricades.</i>
<i>On the sidewalk.</i>

59:32.549 --> 59:34.039
Smart cop.

59:34.484 --> 59:38.352
Okay. You're all gonna be okay.
We're gonna get you out of here.

59:38.521 --> 59:41.388
- Please, just move to the back of the bus.
- Jack?

59:41.558 --> 59:43.958
Just move to the back of the bus,
please, right now.

59:44.127 --> 59:47.028
It's okay. You're gonna get off the bus.
I am a police officer.

59:47.197 --> 59:50.894
Jack, it's Mike Sheehan from HNT.

59:51.067 --> 59:54.969
We worked that barricade deal
on the concourse a few years ago.

59:56.406 --> 59:59.398
I'm gonna put this thing down, okay?

01:00:04.013 --> 01:00:05.878
- I'm sorry.
- Jack!

01:00:06.049 --> 01:00:08.643
I'm sorry that I got you
in this situation.

01:00:08.818 --> 01:00:10.752
You know the drill, no weapons.

01:00:12.288 --> 01:00:13.619
Listen, you're on the job.

01:00:14.057 --> 01:00:16.252
- Just keep your head down.
- You know the deal.

01:00:16.426 --> 01:00:18.951
I'm just gonna step in here,
nice and easy...

01:00:19.562 --> 01:00:23.225
..and hand you this phone
so we can talk, okay?

01:00:23.399 --> 01:00:28.803
Make sure we got no injuries in there.
Jack, just open the door, okay?

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.164
- I need to...
- Just throw it, Mike!

01:00:32.342 --> 01:00:33.673
- Okay, you got it.
- Throw it!

01:00:33.843 --> 01:00:38.075
Here you go. Jack...

01:00:44.053 --> 01:00:45.645
<i>Jack, can you hear me?</i>

01:00:46.356 --> 01:00:48.290
How many people you got in there, Jack?

01:00:49.392 --> 01:00:51.724
Count how many people are here.

01:00:52.662 --> 01:00:55.654
Everybody put your hands up, please.

01:00:56.266 --> 01:01:00.259
<i>N. Y.P.D., we got a situation here.</i>
<i>We need you people back on the sidewalk.</i>

01:01:00.436 --> 01:01:04.338
- <i>Stay behind the barricade.</i>
- Twenty-six, 28. Okay, thank you.

01:01:04.507 --> 01:01:07.135
That's everybody?
Please, don't cry, don't cry.

01:01:07.310 --> 01:01:12.577
Everything's gonna be all right, just relax.
Stay calm, okay? Thank you.

01:01:12.749 --> 01:01:14.808
- What is it?
- Thirty-one. Thirty-one.

01:01:16.319 --> 01:01:22.155
Okay, we have about
40 people on the bus.

01:01:22.559 --> 01:01:24.686
Okay, that's good.

01:01:25.061 --> 01:01:27.996
You know, it's important
that we're clear with each other, Jack.

01:01:28.431 --> 01:01:31.525
<i>ESU and HNT are in place.</i>

01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:37.206
The block is sealed, Jack.
It's a frozen zone.

01:01:37.507 --> 01:01:42.240
<i>So let's work this out</i>
<i>so everybody can go home, all right?</i>

01:01:42.412 --> 01:01:46.075
<i>That's all we wanna do.</i>
<i>Just end it, nice and easy.</i>

01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:48.717
Jack?

01:01:48.885 --> 01:01:51.752
<i>Jack? This is as far as you go, buddy.</i>

01:01:52.088 --> 01:01:53.077
<i>Keep talk</i>...

01:02:11.941 --> 01:02:14.842
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah.

01:02:15.545 --> 01:02:17.638
- Hi, how are you?
- Good.

01:02:17.814 --> 01:02:19.679
How are you?

01:02:19.849 --> 01:02:25.048
My name's Eddie. Hi, how you doing?
Everybody's okay?

01:02:29.125 --> 01:02:30.592
What's your name?

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.428
- Christina.
- Christina.

01:02:33.696 --> 01:02:38.463
That's a pretty name.
How old are you, Christina?

01:02:40.203 --> 01:02:42.569
- Seven.
- Seven years old.

01:02:45.275 --> 01:02:48.244
And my strawberry recipe...
I know I got one. Let me see.

01:02:49.112 --> 01:02:51.979
Where's my strawberry recipe? Let's see.

01:02:52.749 --> 01:02:56.276
Angel-food-cake recipe right here.

01:02:57.353 --> 01:03:00.754
Here we go, strawberry fan.

01:03:01.491 --> 01:03:03.584
See right here on the top?

01:03:03.893 --> 01:03:05.724
I can put a fan on the top.

01:03:06.396 --> 01:03:10.264
You know, like a Chinese fan?

01:03:10.633 --> 01:03:12.760
I could do that.

01:03:13.803 --> 01:03:15.566
When's your birthday?

01:03:16.005 --> 01:03:19.805
- September 22nd.
- Oh, so that's soon.

01:03:19.976 --> 01:03:24.743
Gonna be 8 years old, huh?
That's gonna be a good day for you.

01:03:25.081 --> 01:03:26.605
When's your birthday?

01:03:28.151 --> 01:03:30.415
Today, actually.

01:03:30.787 --> 01:03:34.188
- Yeah.
- Happy birthday to you.

01:03:38.528 --> 01:03:41.986
And, yeah, every day
is somebody's birthday, you know.

01:03:42.165 --> 01:03:45.328
That's gonna be the motto for my shop:

01:03:45.501 --> 01:03:47.560
"Every day's a birthday," you know.

01:03:47.737 --> 01:03:51.673
I didn't know my birthday
was gonna turn out like this, but...

01:03:51.841 --> 01:03:56.642
Yeah, I'm glad to be, you know,
here, alive, you know.

01:03:59.048 --> 01:04:00.948
- Right here, Jack.
- <i>Yeah, Sheehan.</i>

01:04:01.417 --> 01:04:02.782
Commissioner, sir.

01:04:02.952 --> 01:04:04.749
- <i>Sheehan?</i>
- Right here.

01:04:04.921 --> 01:04:07.446
<i>All right. This is what I want.</i>

01:04:07.623 --> 01:04:10.854
I want you to get me
Assistant District Attorney MacDonald...

01:04:11.027 --> 01:04:14.827
..a court stenographer
and somebody from TV.

01:04:14.998 --> 01:04:16.795
<i>Somebody that I would recognize.</i>

01:04:16.966 --> 01:04:19.628
<i>I want them to come on the bus</i>
<i>and record sworn testimony.</i>

01:04:19.802 --> 01:04:24.034
When I get what I want,
I'll let everybody out. Safely.

01:04:24.207 --> 01:04:29.042
- That's a tall order. It'll take some time...
- Just do it. I'm not in the mood, okay?

01:04:29.212 --> 01:04:31.510
<i>Get these people here in 15 minutes...</i>

01:04:31.681 --> 01:04:34.206
<i>... or I'm gonna shoot</i>
<i>these passengers one at a time...</i>

01:04:34.384 --> 01:04:36.852
- <i>... and throw them out the door.</i>
- Jack, be cool, okay?

01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:39.989
Let's not do anything rash.
This thing can end without bloodshed.

01:04:40.156 --> 01:04:42.124
- Okay? We can work this...
- <i>Fifteen minutes.</i>

01:04:42.291 --> 01:04:44.987
Jack? Jack?

01:04:48.164 --> 01:04:49.961
He's gone.

01:04:51.834 --> 01:04:53.426
All right, everybody on your feet.

01:04:54.904 --> 01:04:57.873
- Jack, what are you doing?
- Gotta get these people off this bus.

01:04:58.041 --> 01:05:01.306
But you just made your call.
You called the DA. They said they'd come.

01:05:01.477 --> 01:05:03.775
- Everybody's coming.
- Nobody's coming, okay?

01:05:03.946 --> 01:05:05.504
What do you mean,
nobody's coming?

01:05:05.681 --> 01:05:08.912
They're gonna breach this bus
in less than five minutes.

01:05:09.085 --> 01:05:12.213
- They're gonna kill me, kill you...
- Jack, what about testifying?

01:05:12.388 --> 01:05:14.686
We're right here. We can go.
We can end this.

01:05:14.857 --> 01:05:17.291
- We can testify.
- Nobody's testifying.

01:05:18.294 --> 01:05:20.387
It's all over, Eddie.

01:05:20.563 --> 01:05:22.758
We lose, kid.

01:05:34.811 --> 01:05:37.541
- Hey, Ray.
- Frank.

01:05:37.713 --> 01:05:39.305
You?

01:05:40.983 --> 01:05:42.280
You guys going in?

01:05:42.452 --> 01:05:44.886
The commissioner hasn't given us
the green light yet.

01:05:45.054 --> 01:05:51.050
Well, I don't need to remind you
that he shot two of us.

01:05:53.096 --> 01:05:55.030
Enough said.

01:05:55.498 --> 01:05:58.399
We got maybe 40 civilians on that bus.
Get them out.

01:05:58.568 --> 01:06:00.661
I don't want anybody hurt,
including our guys.

01:06:00.837 --> 01:06:03.931
Nobody's gonna get hurt, commissioner.
These guys know what to do.

01:06:11.147 --> 01:06:13.672
- We have movement.
- <i>Let's move in.</i>

01:06:13.850 --> 01:06:16.683
- <i>Hold your fire. Repeat, hold your fire.</i>
- <i>Move in to the bus. Let's go.</i>

01:06:19.689 --> 01:06:21.452
Hey. What...?

01:06:23.426 --> 01:06:24.415
Bob.

01:06:27.296 --> 01:06:28.490
When you get outside...

01:06:28.664 --> 01:06:30.529
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:33.362
They'll take you to a holding area.
It'll be hectic.

01:06:33.536 --> 01:06:36.437
- But everybody's out there...
- Listen to me, listen to me.

01:06:36.606 --> 01:06:39.166
Once you get outside that perimeter,
you just get lost.

01:06:39.342 --> 01:06:42.334
- What if they...?
- Keep moving. You just keep moving.

01:06:42.512 --> 01:06:43.843
Come here. You look great.

01:06:44.013 --> 01:06:45.776
Hey, gray suit.

01:06:46.916 --> 01:06:48.440
Got you a gray suit.

01:06:48.618 --> 01:06:51.815
All right? Hands in the air, folks.
Don't look back.

01:06:59.896 --> 01:07:02.831
Hands in the air, you'll be all right.
You'll be all right.

01:07:15.044 --> 01:07:16.568
Next. Sorry.

01:07:26.355 --> 01:07:28.220
Come on, come on, let's go!

01:07:28.391 --> 01:07:30.222
- What is he doing?
- How should I know?

01:07:30.393 --> 01:07:32.486
- I'll let you know when I know.
- Don't you...

01:07:32.662 --> 01:07:35.028
I'll let you know when I know.
Out of my face!

01:07:45.208 --> 01:07:47.506
Kaller, give me a hand with them!

01:07:51.647 --> 01:07:54.013
Bobby? Right there. Right here.

01:07:54.550 --> 01:07:57.246
- That's him. That's him.
- Hey, man!

01:07:58.354 --> 01:08:00.481
- It's not him.
- Let him go.

01:08:00.656 --> 01:08:02.715
- The dude, he changed. It's not me.
- What?

01:08:02.892 --> 01:08:05.554
- He's in a suit, a gray suit.
- Suit, gray suit.

01:08:26.482 --> 01:08:29.144
- We count 31.
- That leaves eight people on the bus.

01:08:29.318 --> 01:08:30.979
No, I was the last one off the bus.

01:08:31.153 --> 01:08:34.054
The only person left on that bus
is the guy with the gun.

01:08:35.124 --> 01:08:36.955
- Then go, do it!
- Let's go, let's go.

01:08:37.126 --> 01:08:40.357
- Get your people out there. Let's go.
- Come on, let's go.

01:08:41.162 --> 01:08:44.291
Mosley is still on the bus.
That kid is here somewhere. We checked...

01:08:44.466 --> 01:08:46.264
Bobby, I don't care what you checked.

01:08:46.435 --> 01:08:48.995
Check it again, now. Go.
You guys, that way.

01:09:02.818 --> 01:09:07.778
This is Detective Jack Mosley.
Shield number 227.

01:09:18.801 --> 01:09:21.361
I guess this will be
my last will and testament.

01:10:15.191 --> 01:10:16.419
Don't shoot!

01:10:16.792 --> 01:10:18.191
Hold your fire!

01:10:18.361 --> 01:10:20.158
Do not shoot! Do not shoot!

01:10:20.329 --> 01:10:22.524
- <i>Who is that?</i>
- Hold your fire!

01:10:23.332 --> 01:10:25.391
- Hold your fire!
- <i>Is it that wit from the 32?</i>

01:10:27.002 --> 01:10:29.266
Get on your goddamn radio.
Find out who that is.

01:10:29.438 --> 01:10:31.201
Guns down, hold your fire!

01:10:32.742 --> 01:10:33.970
Don't shoot!

01:10:34.143 --> 01:10:36.077
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:39.442
Don't shoot!

01:10:39.615 --> 01:10:41.378
Don't shoot!

01:10:44.854 --> 01:10:48.255
- Do not move! Step away from the bus!
- Don't shoot, hold your fire!

01:10:48.424 --> 01:10:50.415
- Do not shoot!
- Get away from the bus!

01:10:50.593 --> 01:10:51.719
Hold your fire.

01:10:52.728 --> 01:10:56.596
Jack. Jack, it's me. Jack Mosley!

01:10:57.233 --> 01:10:59.133
Lt's me, Eddie, Jack.

01:11:01.971 --> 01:11:03.370
Chuck Berry.

01:11:03.706 --> 01:11:05.196
Chuck Berry.

01:11:05.674 --> 01:11:09.201
Chuck Berry,
he got locked up for armed robbery.

01:11:09.378 --> 01:11:11.642
He changed. He changed.

01:11:13.382 --> 01:11:16.909
Barry White, he stole 300 tires.

01:11:17.086 --> 01:11:22.217
Can you picture big Barry White
stealing 300 tires? He changed.

01:11:22.391 --> 01:11:24.757
You said... You said people don't change.

01:11:25.327 --> 01:11:27.727
- People change.
- Eddie.

01:11:28.464 --> 01:11:30.830
- What?
- You're killing me.

01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:34.831
Team three, breach the bus.
Repeat, team three, breach the bus.

01:11:35.004 --> 01:11:37.472
<i>Entrance team moving in.</i>

01:11:50.586 --> 01:11:53.077
Get out of the way!

01:11:53.923 --> 01:11:56.517
Head down!
Cover your ears and your eyes!

01:12:02.097 --> 01:12:03.325
- Hold fire.
- Go, go!

01:12:03.732 --> 01:12:05.791
- Go, go, go!
- Hold your fire!

01:12:05.968 --> 01:12:06.992
This is a nightmare.

01:12:23.886 --> 01:12:25.217
Hold fire!

01:12:56.752 --> 01:12:58.549
- Let's go! Move, move, move!
- Stay down!

01:12:58.721 --> 01:13:00.188
- Move up! Move up!
- Come here.

01:13:00.356 --> 01:13:03.086
<i>Team two, status?</i>

01:13:03.259 --> 01:13:06.353
Go ahead! Take it! Go!

01:13:36.959 --> 01:13:39.223
The bus is empty.

01:13:39.395 --> 01:13:41.090
They went through the bus doors!

01:13:41.263 --> 01:13:44.892
They're in the goddamn building!
Seal it off!

01:13:45.568 --> 01:13:48.435
- <i>All clear. The bus is empty.</i>
- <i>They've entered the building.</i>

01:13:50.773 --> 01:13:52.365
Seal the building, start a search.

01:13:52.541 --> 01:13:55.009
Remember, heads up.
He just shot two cops. Be careful.

01:13:57.346 --> 01:13:59.246
Jack, I gotta tell you something.

01:13:59.415 --> 01:14:01.815
Hey, man. Jack, listen to me, man.

01:14:01.984 --> 01:14:04.043
Jack, I wanna tell you something.

01:14:04.219 --> 01:14:07.916
Hold on, hold on, wait.
I gotta tell you something. It's important.

01:14:08.457 --> 01:14:10.925
Shit. Get up, go.

01:14:13.128 --> 01:14:15.028
Oh, shit.

01:14:16.198 --> 01:14:18.598
Hey, sir. I'm a cop, all right?
I'm on the job.

01:14:18.767 --> 01:14:20.792
Look, I need that phone for a minute.

01:14:20.970 --> 01:14:22.562
Look what you did to my suit, man.

01:14:23.105 --> 01:14:25.733
I told you you was gonna get me shot.

01:14:26.742 --> 01:14:28.175
It's me. I need your help.

01:14:28.611 --> 01:14:32.707
All this started because my friend
Maurice came by my house.

01:14:34.483 --> 01:14:37.941
Two days ago,
Maurice came by my house.

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:39.519
He all excited.

01:14:39.688 --> 01:14:42.282
He got a shoebox.

01:14:42.458 --> 01:14:43.755
He had a gun.

01:14:43.926 --> 01:14:46.486
He talking about,
"Hold this for me for a little while."

01:14:46.662 --> 01:14:50.428
I'm like, "I'm on parole."
He like, "Me too."

01:14:50.599 --> 01:14:54.535
Next day, somebody shot him.

01:14:55.838 --> 01:14:58.363
Thirty-two thousand dollars
in that shoebox.

01:15:00.476 --> 01:15:03.206
- That's a sign, huh?
- Yeah.

01:15:03.379 --> 01:15:05.609
It's a very big sign.

01:15:05.781 --> 01:15:08.306
Easy, easy, easy.

01:15:12.254 --> 01:15:16.623
You know how much it gonna take me
to open the bakery?

01:15:19.028 --> 01:15:21.553
Thirty-one thousand dollars.

01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:26.463
Jack, I got so nervous
I ran out the house.

01:15:26.635 --> 01:15:31.163
I went to Port Authority
and I put the money in a locker.

01:15:35.244 --> 01:15:36.506
I get back to my house...

01:15:36.679 --> 01:15:39.011
..my parole officer's there...

01:15:39.181 --> 01:15:40.808
..in my house.

01:15:40.983 --> 01:15:43.816
He got Maurice's gun in his hand.

01:15:43.986 --> 01:15:47.251
He looking at me like, "That's it, Eddie."

01:15:47.589 --> 01:15:49.489
And he's talking about 15 years, man.

01:15:50.059 --> 01:15:52.027
I got so sick.

01:15:52.194 --> 01:15:55.755
Then the DA came to my cell...

01:15:57.232 --> 01:16:00.258
..and he showed me
the picture of that cop.

01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:03.601
Then I met you.

01:16:04.139 --> 01:16:09.042
Jack, they clean them lockers out
every 24 hours.

01:16:10.479 --> 01:16:12.504
I had a little schedule going, man.

01:16:13.882 --> 01:16:16.282
Court at 10:00...

01:16:17.319 --> 01:16:19.583
..Port Authority at 12.

01:16:19.755 --> 01:16:21.746
Hey. Hey, look at me. Wake up.

01:16:22.591 --> 01:16:24.525
You ain't gonna die on me, are you?

01:16:26.695 --> 01:16:29.357
I don't know, I never died before.

01:16:29.531 --> 01:16:31.829
It's not gonna happen today.

01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:43.400
Hey. Thank you for coming.

01:16:43.579 --> 01:16:48.414
- What's going on?
- Look. Shot here. I think it went in and out.

01:16:48.784 --> 01:16:50.615
Yeah, let's get him in.

01:16:52.855 --> 01:16:54.288
I know you.

01:16:54.456 --> 01:16:56.321
- Come on.
- I was at your house.

01:16:56.492 --> 01:16:58.585
- You were at my apartment?
- Had to get my gun.

01:16:58.761 --> 01:17:00.626
Bigmouth.

01:17:01.196 --> 01:17:04.563
It was very nice, very clean.

01:17:05.634 --> 01:17:08.102
The police grilled me
for an hour at the hospital.

01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:09.498
What'd you say to them?

01:17:09.671 --> 01:17:12.071
That you're a self-medicating,
depressed individual.

01:17:12.241 --> 01:17:14.402
And you don't care
about anything or anyone.

01:17:14.576 --> 01:17:19.070
Oh, she's honest, straightforward.
That's sexy. I like that.

01:17:28.657 --> 01:17:30.181
What'd you do this time, Jack?

01:17:30.359 --> 01:17:33.123
He saved my life a couple times.

01:17:34.429 --> 01:17:39.298
Hey, he's a good dude.
You gotta give him another chance.

01:17:39.468 --> 01:17:42.403
I don't know what he did,
but you gotta give him another chance.

01:17:42.571 --> 01:17:45.005
He gotta have somebody to talk to.

01:17:45.174 --> 01:17:47.699
I'm not gonna be around.

01:17:49.611 --> 01:17:53.206
- Eddie, this is my sister, Diane.
- What?

01:17:53.849 --> 01:17:55.942
She's your sister?

01:17:56.518 --> 01:17:58.349
Oh, man.

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:02.217
I just started having a little hope for you.
Your family don't even like you.

01:18:02.391 --> 01:18:05.053
I got a sister too.

01:18:06.128 --> 01:18:08.858
But she live in Seattle.

01:18:09.031 --> 01:18:11.465
I was supposed to go out there
and start my bakery.

01:18:11.633 --> 01:18:14.158
I was supposed to go out there today
to see her.

01:18:14.336 --> 01:18:16.327
See her on the bus.

01:18:17.072 --> 01:18:18.300
I can stop the bleeding...

01:18:18.473 --> 01:18:20.964
..but he's gotta get stitched up,
get to a hospital.

01:18:21.476 --> 01:18:23.569
We gotta be at the courthouse
in less than 20.

01:18:24.079 --> 01:18:26.240
You're gonna have to do it.

01:18:29.785 --> 01:18:32.481
You're gonna be fine, Eddie.
It's not as bad as it looks.

01:18:34.756 --> 01:18:36.519
What happened to your hand?

01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:40.251
I gotta ask you one more favor.

01:18:42.164 --> 01:18:44.689
Just a little favor.

01:18:51.573 --> 01:18:53.871
Hey, is today really your birthday?

01:18:54.042 --> 01:18:55.703
No.

01:18:55.878 --> 01:19:00.474
No, I just said that because the little girl,
she was so scared.

01:19:01.183 --> 01:19:03.378
She was cute, man.

01:19:04.286 --> 01:19:06.220
When's your birthday?

01:19:08.757 --> 01:19:11.590
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

01:19:13.562 --> 01:19:16.258
No, for real, I don't know.

01:19:16.431 --> 01:19:20.367
I'm not... I came up in foster care.
Had a lot of birthdays.

01:19:20.535 --> 01:19:25.370
But didn't you say...? You got a sister, right?
That you're going to see?

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:28.532
Yeah, I just found out about her
a couple months ago.

01:19:28.710 --> 01:19:30.769
- Never met your sister?
- No.

01:19:32.347 --> 01:19:35.180
That's why I'm going out to Seattle
to meet her.

01:19:36.285 --> 01:19:37.582
I'm looking forward.

01:19:37.753 --> 01:19:40.551
Maybe she turns out
to look like Angelina Jolie.

01:19:40.722 --> 01:19:43.987
Shit, if she do,
I hope she ain't my sister.

01:19:48.363 --> 01:19:50.661
Hey, man, what you want
on your cake, man?

01:19:50.832 --> 01:19:52.993
You never told me.
I gotta send you one, man.

01:19:54.136 --> 01:19:57.003
- I don't want no cake, Eddie.
- Damn it, Jack, come on, man...

01:19:57.172 --> 01:19:59.766
I can't think of anything
that has happened in my life...

01:19:59.942 --> 01:20:03.002
..that I would want written on a cake.
- Nothing?

01:20:05.147 --> 01:20:07.081
I'm not a good guy, Eddie.

01:20:12.287 --> 01:20:14.414
I'm not a good guy.

01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:20.091
Yeah, me neither.

01:20:34.710 --> 01:20:35.938
- Diane.
- Frank.

01:20:36.111 --> 01:20:37.908
Give me the keys.

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:40.913
- Stay in the car.
- Little out of your sector, aren't you?

01:20:41.083 --> 01:20:42.710
Saving lives knows no bounds.

01:20:42.884 --> 01:20:45.375
- You should know that, Frank.
- You look good.

01:20:45.554 --> 01:20:47.784
You look a little desperate.
Doesn't suit you.

01:20:47.956 --> 01:20:49.423
Open the door.

01:20:49.591 --> 01:20:51.821
Open the door. Open the door.

01:20:53.261 --> 01:20:55.729
Sorry, Jack, this is as close
as I can get you.

01:21:02.337 --> 01:21:04.464
Like I said, you're looking good.

01:21:09.144 --> 01:21:10.702
Thanks, kid.

01:21:11.813 --> 01:21:13.178
All right, come on, let's go.

01:21:13.348 --> 01:21:15.816
No, hey, hold on. Hold on a minute.

01:21:15.984 --> 01:21:17.383
Why is that? Hold on for what?

01:21:17.552 --> 01:21:19.452
This is as far as you go too.

01:21:19.621 --> 01:21:21.748
- Come on, man. I don't...
- Listen to me, Eddie.

01:21:21.923 --> 01:21:24.357
- What?
- Listen.

01:21:25.761 --> 01:21:28.457
Those guys you were gonna
testify against...

01:21:28.630 --> 01:21:30.689
..those cops?
- Yeah?

01:21:32.167 --> 01:21:33.566
I was one of them.

01:21:42.044 --> 01:21:44.444
You were gonna testify against me too.

01:21:47.082 --> 01:21:49.175
I did what they did.

01:21:49.351 --> 01:21:51.819
We did some bad things.

01:21:52.988 --> 01:21:56.185
I did another bad thing when I used you.

01:21:57.426 --> 01:22:01.624
I was gonna let you do
what I should have done.

01:22:01.797 --> 01:22:04.823
What I should have had the courage
to do six years ago.

01:22:10.272 --> 01:22:11.637
I'm sorry.

01:22:16.778 --> 01:22:21.010
You know, if you didn't
come to get me today...

01:22:22.050 --> 01:22:24.484
..l'd be dead right now.

01:22:24.653 --> 01:22:26.450
- Right.
- So...

01:22:27.923 --> 01:22:30.517
I was supposed to meet you.

01:22:31.126 --> 01:22:33.356
That was the sign.

01:22:33.762 --> 01:22:35.992
You saved my life, kid.

01:22:40.902 --> 01:22:43.427
Take care of yourself, kid.

01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:46.568
Thank you.

01:22:47.109 --> 01:22:50.272
Make cakes, Eddie the baker.

01:22:57.986 --> 01:23:01.786
Oh, yeah. You give the car keys
to your best friend.

01:23:01.957 --> 01:23:04.653
You let him take the old lady
to the hospital.

01:23:04.826 --> 01:23:09.695
You stay at the bus stop with the girl
because she's the girl of your dreams, right?

01:23:09.865 --> 01:23:12.265
So everything's gonna be okay.

01:23:13.168 --> 01:23:15.136
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:23:16.404 --> 01:23:18.634
Have fun in Seattle. Say hi to your sister.

01:23:18.807 --> 01:23:20.399
Yeah.

01:23:24.646 --> 01:23:26.136
Yeah.

01:23:27.449 --> 01:23:30.247
Get him to the Port Authority.
Make sure he gets on that bus.

01:23:30.418 --> 01:23:31.646
- Carl, thanks.
- No problem.

01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:33.219
All right.

01:24:45.794 --> 01:24:47.455
Hell of a morning, huh?

01:24:57.539 --> 01:24:58.801
Where's the wit?

01:25:01.142 --> 01:25:02.473
You're looking at him.

01:25:06.548 --> 01:25:08.413
I let the kid go, Frank.

01:25:09.784 --> 01:25:13.743
- You're not gonna get to him now.
- Bullshit.

01:25:15.457 --> 01:25:16.719
Wouldn't do that.

01:25:26.468 --> 01:25:28.095
So...

01:25:29.938 --> 01:25:31.929
..what do you think
you're gonna tell them?

01:25:33.241 --> 01:25:35.334
Are you gonna tell them everything?

01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:38.172
Are you gonna tell them about you too?

01:25:39.748 --> 01:25:41.909
You think that's gonna
make you feel better?

01:25:42.317 --> 01:25:44.046
Nothing's gonna make me feel better.

01:25:44.219 --> 01:25:45.948
Then why?

01:25:47.222 --> 01:25:49.247
Look, Jack, you and me...

01:25:49.424 --> 01:25:54.418
..we did our business in a certain way.

01:25:56.631 --> 01:26:00.158
You never complained
when we cleared the tough cases.

01:26:00.335 --> 01:26:04.101
It didn't bother you
doing any of that until...

01:26:05.473 --> 01:26:08.203
Listen to me, all right? You listen.

01:26:08.376 --> 01:26:11.277
Okay, Jack? Really listen.

01:26:11.446 --> 01:26:14.347
Whatever you think
that you are gonna do up there...

01:26:15.250 --> 01:26:17.047
..it is never gonna happen.

01:26:18.019 --> 01:26:20.579
You are not gonna make it.

01:26:22.190 --> 01:26:24.658
Is that what you're thinking, Frank?

01:26:25.193 --> 01:26:29.357
You're gonna shoot me down here?
Nobody knows?

01:26:31.032 --> 01:26:33.626
Like the Ling family, huh?

01:26:33.802 --> 01:26:35.030
Like they never knew.

01:26:35.203 --> 01:26:37.797
He was a stupid old man
who wouldn't keep his mouth shut.

01:26:37.972 --> 01:26:40.497
All right, so I stuck a gun
in some guy's mouth.

01:26:40.675 --> 01:26:44.008
- He had a heart attack, he died. So what?
- So what?

01:26:44.179 --> 01:26:47.376
Look, if it hadn't happened
the way that it did, if he hadn't died...

01:26:47.549 --> 01:26:50.712
..you would've been patting me
on the back, saying, "Good job."

01:26:50.885 --> 01:26:53.615
Collateral damage,
it is a fact of life in this business.

01:26:53.788 --> 01:26:57.349
He took his last breaths while you were
wiping the fingerprints off the room.

01:26:57.525 --> 01:27:00.460
- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was an innocent man.

01:27:00.628 --> 01:27:03.995
- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was somebody's husband.

01:27:04.165 --> 01:27:06.929
- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was somebody's father.

01:27:07.102 --> 01:27:09.900
He was gonna take down our case!
What were we supposed to do?

01:27:10.071 --> 01:27:13.404
- He wanted to tell the truth.
- Fuck the truth!

01:27:24.252 --> 01:27:25.685
Right.

01:27:44.739 --> 01:27:47.435
I'm not gonna need this anymore.

01:28:32.068 --> 01:28:34.036
<i>Bobby? He's on his way up.</i>

01:28:34.904 --> 01:28:35.893
Take him out.

01:29:09.339 --> 01:29:12.137
Mosley's in the building!
Get the ADA. Freeze!

01:29:12.308 --> 01:29:14.242
- Hands in the air!
- Don't shoot.

01:29:14.410 --> 01:29:16.571
- Don't move! Down on your knees.
- I'm not armed.

01:29:16.746 --> 01:29:19.476
- Down on your knees! Now!
- Don't shoot, I'm not armed.

01:29:19.649 --> 01:29:23.278
Lower your weapon. Just call
ADA MacDonald, please, on the radio.

01:29:23.453 --> 01:29:25.785
- Hands up.
- Get ADA MacDonald here right now!

01:29:25.955 --> 01:29:28.253
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot me.
- Get your hands up!

01:29:28.424 --> 01:29:30.187
Just get ADA MacDonald for me.

01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:33.158
- Jack, come on!
- I won't argue with you. Get down.

01:29:33.329 --> 01:29:35.126
Mosley! Mosley!

01:29:35.298 --> 01:29:36.560
Hands up!

01:29:36.733 --> 01:29:38.997
Where's my witness?
Where's Edward Bunker?

01:29:39.602 --> 01:29:41.467
He didn't make it.

01:29:42.305 --> 01:29:43.829
I'm gonna take his place.

01:29:49.445 --> 01:29:52.380
- Please lower your weapons.
- Hold your fire and stand down.

01:29:52.548 --> 01:29:54.175
Back off.

01:29:56.352 --> 01:29:58.479
I have information...

01:29:58.654 --> 01:30:01.885
..regarding your ongoing
witness-tampering investigation.

01:30:02.759 --> 01:30:05.523
Dates, cases that include extortion...

01:30:06.095 --> 01:30:09.121
..manslaughter and possible homicide...

01:30:09.932 --> 01:30:12.799
..involving members
of the 14th Precinct.

01:30:13.903 --> 01:30:17.361
These charges include
Captain Dan Gruber...

01:30:17.707 --> 01:30:19.868
..detectives Jerry Shue...

01:30:20.576 --> 01:30:22.544
..Edward Maldonado...

01:30:23.312 --> 01:30:25.542
..Bob Torres...

01:30:25.715 --> 01:30:27.615
..Jim Mulvey...

01:30:28.918 --> 01:30:30.579
..myself...

01:30:31.654 --> 01:30:33.383
..and Detective Frank Nugent.

01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:40.090
What's this about, Mosley?
What do you want?

01:30:40.863 --> 01:30:42.888
I want Edward Bunker's record expunged.

01:30:43.099 --> 01:30:46.330
- Done. What else?
- Nothing else.

01:30:46.502 --> 01:30:48.265
You can substantiate all this, Mosley?

01:30:49.872 --> 01:30:51.339
Yeah.

01:30:52.341 --> 01:30:53.433
Gun!

01:30:59.682 --> 01:31:02.207
Hold your fire. I fired that shot.

01:31:08.024 --> 01:31:11.687
<i>You're gonna shoot me down here?</i>
<i>Nobody knows?</i>

01:31:13.796 --> 01:31:15.423
<i>Like the Ling family, huh?</i>

01:31:16.399 --> 01:31:18.594
<i>Like they never knew.</i>

01:31:18.768 --> 01:31:21.362
<i>He was a stupid old man</i>
<i>who wouldn't keep his mouth shut.</i>

01:31:21.537 --> 01:31:23.971
<i>All right, so I stuck a gun</i>
<i>in some guy's mouth.</i>

01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:27.166
- <i>He had a heart attack, he died. So what?</i>
- <i>So what?</i>

01:31:27.343 --> 01:31:29.436
- <i>So what?</i>
- <i>So how about he was innocent?</i>

01:31:29.612 --> 01:31:32.046
- <i>Innocent?</i>
- <i>How about he didn't deserve to die?</i>

01:31:32.215 --> 01:31:35.707
<i>Look, if it hadn't happened</i>
<i>the way that it did, if he hadn't died...</i>

01:31:35.885 --> 01:31:38.820
<i>... you would've been patting me</i>
<i>on the back, saying, "Good job."</i>

01:31:38.988 --> 01:31:41.786
<i>Collateral damage,</i>
<i>it is a fact of life in this business.</i>

01:31:41.958 --> 01:31:45.519
<i>He took his last breaths while you were</i>
<i>wiping the fingerprints off the room.</i>

01:31:45.695 --> 01:31:48.357
- <i>He was gonna take down our case.</i>
- <i>He was an innocent man.</i>

01:31:48.531 --> 01:31:51.762
- <i>He was gonna take down our case.</i>
- <i>He was somebody's husband.</i>

01:31:51.934 --> 01:31:54.698
- <i>He was gonna take down our case.</i>
- <i>He was somebody's father.</i>

01:31:54.871 --> 01:31:57.669
<i>He was gonna take down our case!</i>
<i>What were we supposed to do?</i>

01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:00.832
- <i>He wanted to tell the truth.</i>
- <i>Fuck the truth!</i>

01:32:04.547 --> 01:32:06.708
Let's get you to the jury.

01:32:21.797 --> 01:32:22.821
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks.

01:32:22.999 --> 01:32:24.261
Okay.

01:32:41.183 --> 01:32:43.549
- Hey, happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Jack.

01:32:43.719 --> 01:32:45.812
Welcome back, Jack.

01:32:45.988 --> 01:32:48.513
- Are you kidding me?
- Two years in the pen is enough.

01:32:48.691 --> 01:32:50.625
Thanks for that memory. Thank you.

01:32:50.793 --> 01:32:52.624
- Happy birthday, Jack.
- Happy birthday.

01:32:52.795 --> 01:32:55.161
- Happy birthday. Blow them out.
- Welcome home.

01:32:55.331 --> 01:32:57.891
I hate birthdays, you know that, right?

01:32:59.835 --> 01:33:02.497
- Sorry, sorry.
- Happy birthday.

01:33:12.481 --> 01:33:14.278
This came with it.

01:33:25.861 --> 01:33:27.852
<i>Dear Jack Mosley:</i>

01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:32.626
<i>I hope you're doing well and everything</i>
<i>worked out like it was supposed to.</i>

01:33:32.802 --> 01:33:34.827
<i>I'm doing great.</i>

01:33:35.004 --> 01:33:36.995
<i>Seattle is different, and I like it a lot.</i>

01:33:37.173 --> 01:33:41.542
<i>I'm not sure I ever smelled fresh air</i>
<i>before I got here. It's a trip.</i>

01:33:41.711 --> 01:33:45.169
<i>Sometimes I can't believe it.</i>
<i>It's the best feeling I've had in my life.</i>

01:33:45.848 --> 01:33:47.748
<i>I'm busting my ass,</i>
<i>but I'm happy, though.</i>

01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:53.711
<i>The bakery is now open. Three cheers.</i>

01:33:55.524 --> 01:33:58.220
<i>I put my name first</i>
<i>because I'm doing all the hard work.</i>

01:33:58.394 --> 01:34:00.453
<i>These ovens are hot, man.</i>

01:34:00.630 --> 01:34:02.996
<i>Hope you like the cake.</i>
<i>What did I tell you?</i>

01:34:03.165 --> 01:34:07.499
- That's Eddie.
- <i>lf you're ever in town, you got a friend.</i>

01:34:07.670 --> 01:34:10.696
<i>Thank you for doing the right thing,</i>
<i>Jack Mosley. God bless you.</i>

01:34:11.207 --> 01:34:14.938
<i>Keep in touch. Peace.</i>

01:34:15.111 --> 01:34:17.341
- That's great.
- Go on, take one more. Look.

01:34:17.513 --> 01:34:21.916
You know how this guy...?
I was talking, take one more.

01:34:23.552 --> 01:34:25.782
<i>Happy birthday, Jack.</i>
