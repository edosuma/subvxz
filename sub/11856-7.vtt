WEBVTT

00:13.500 --> 00:17.166
(all)
Ten, nine, eight, seven

00:17.250 --> 00:18.959
six, five

00:19.041 --> 00:21.625
four, three, two, one!

00:25.166 --> 00:27.792
Okay, everyone, final score

00:27.875 --> 00:30.250
for Lionstaff
initial public offering.

00:30.333 --> 00:33.417
Opening price, $11 a share.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.750
Closing price, 31.

00:38.667 --> 00:41.333
Gentlemen,
you're officially
rich.

00:41.417 --> 00:44.208
So this is the last free
pizza
you're getting on me.

00:45.583 --> 00:48.625
Scott, 31,
that's like 15
million.

00:48.709 --> 00:51.750
For the company. How much
is it for me personally?

00:51.834 --> 00:53.083
I don't know,
Midas.
Enough.

00:53.166 --> 00:56.500
Scott, Amy, you kids.
We did it.

00:56.583 --> 01:00.000
And the guys at the club said
that tech stocks are over.

01:00.083 --> 01:02.875
Well, youth is the future,
and they're old.

01:02.959 --> 01:04.583
- We're glad you're pleased.
- Pleased?

01:04.667 --> 01:06.667
I'm ready to party. You got
something set up for after?

01:06.750 --> 01:09.458
Uh, Mr. Coleman, the brokers
are
asking for a picture with you.

01:09.542 --> 01:11.709
- Sure.
- Not with us?

01:11.792 --> 01:15.125
If you really want your
picture
taken dressed like that.

01:19.709 --> 01:20.917
Don't worry.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Lionstaff will help people.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.166
It's not just
a trough of
money.

01:25.250 --> 01:27.333
Thanks,
but that's not it.

01:27.417 --> 01:28.500
Then what?

01:30.208 --> 01:33.333
It's all on paper.
It's not real yet.

01:33.417 --> 01:34.709
To be worried
at a time like
this

01:34.792 --> 01:37.291
takes a special kind
of person.

01:39.625 --> 01:40.917
No, I'm happy.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I really am.

02:31.834 --> 02:33.166
I think finally
the public
schools

02:33.250 --> 02:35.625
are doing something
right,
and then this.

02:35.709 --> 02:37.875
Just a sec. It's loading.

02:37.959 --> 02:39.500
And what has your boy
found exactly?

02:39.583 --> 02:42.417
Death threats in a
document
on the computer.

02:42.500 --> 02:43.709
Donated to the school.

02:43.792 --> 02:45.500
I found it on the hard drive.

02:45.583 --> 02:47.333
'I was recovering it
for extra credit.'

02:47.417 --> 02:49.083
It sounds like
you're good at this.

02:49.166 --> 02:51.834
Nah, I just can't do PE.

02:52.834 --> 02:54.709
It's up. Take a look.

02:54.792 --> 02:56.834
Entries are dated.
Looks like a diary.

02:56.917 --> 02:58.792
(Valens)
'Well, it could be
just a prank.'

02:58.875 --> 03:00.458
That's what I thought.

03:00.542 --> 03:02.291
But then I looked at the name.

03:03.375 --> 03:05.750
Amy Lind's an actual person..

03:05.834 --> 03:08.166
...who's, like,
actually dead.

03:12.041 --> 03:14.083
(Valens)
'"Poison shuts her eyes.'

03:14.166 --> 03:16.083
'"Poison stops her tongue.'

03:16.166 --> 03:17.792
'"Poison stops her'

03:17.875 --> 03:20.500
ghasty heart."
Ghasty?

03:20.583 --> 03:23.000
Writer don't wanna break
the flow and run spell check?

03:24.333 --> 03:27.041
"Goodbye to hell, Amy Lind."

03:27.125 --> 03:29.333
Dies of a heart attack.
24 years old.

03:29.417 --> 03:30.917
Poison stops her heart.

03:32.625 --> 03:34.083
You can take it from here.

03:35.875 --> 03:37.959
- Come on.
- They could need me.

03:38.041 --> 03:40.208
It's good work,
we got any questions

03:40.291 --> 03:41.458
we'll let you know.

03:42.959 --> 03:44.041
Thanks.

03:49.208 --> 03:51.208
Twenty four's pretty
young
to have a bad ticker.

03:51.291 --> 03:54.625
Yeah, I guess it happens,
but, uh, so does poison.

03:54.709 --> 03:58.041
Let's find this writer
who hated Amy so much.

03:58.125 --> 04:00.750
See if he went from diarist..

04:00.834 --> 04:02.041
...to doer.

04:44.709 --> 04:46.750
Mayes, what's up?

04:46.834 --> 04:49.041
Hey, Scotty.

04:49.125 --> 04:50.333
Manny Fernandez called me.

04:50.417 --> 04:51.917
I know.

04:52.041 --> 04:54.208
I asked her if I
could
catch you out here.

04:54.291 --> 04:55.959
Okay.

04:56.041 --> 04:57.875
We gave it some thought
before reaching out to
you.

04:57.959 --> 04:59.375
Didn't wanna stir things up.

04:59.458 --> 05:02.125
- What happened, Anna?
- Um..

05:02.208 --> 05:04.875
We had an incident
on the bridge this
morning.

05:04.959 --> 05:06.917
Guy threw a girl
into the
Schuylkill.

05:11.792 --> 05:12.750
She died?

05:12.834 --> 05:13.750
In ICU.

05:13.834 --> 05:16.000
Busted up pretty bad.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.291
Washed up near
the same spot as Elisa.

05:18.375 --> 05:20.041
You're thinking this is
a serial thing with him?

05:20.125 --> 05:22.625
- Don't know yet.
- But it was the same spot.

05:22.709 --> 05:23.834
As her?

05:25.667 --> 05:29.000
Figured you'd want your shot
at this guy when he came in.

05:29.083 --> 05:29.959
Yeah.

05:30.041 --> 05:31.375
Probably tomorrow sometime?

05:33.041 --> 05:34.959
What's his name?
I'll read up.

05:35.041 --> 05:36.375
Dante Catches.

05:41.083 --> 05:42.333
I figured..

05:44.000 --> 05:45.291
...this would be the way.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.291
Sit tight.

05:48.375 --> 05:50.000
Somethin' about Elisa
would come out.

05:52.667 --> 05:53.792
Yeah.

05:55.667 --> 05:56.834
Yeah.

06:01.125 --> 06:02.709
Thanks, Anna.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.542
(Vera)
'Amy Lind died two days'

06:07.625 --> 06:09.417
'after the last entry
in that diary.'

06:09.500 --> 06:11.792
The computer unit
have any luck with it?

06:11.875 --> 06:14.000
Can't ID a writer, but it
came
from an internet company.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.208
Lionstaff.

06:15.291 --> 06:16.959
Is that the start
up
Amy worked at?

06:17.041 --> 06:18.917
No, not just worked at,
created..

06:19.000 --> 06:21.333
...with fellow Wharton grad,
Scott Sawyer.

06:21.417 --> 06:23.125
They were co-CEOs.

06:23.208 --> 06:24.959
Nice timing they had.

06:25.041 --> 06:26.792
Got their MBAs in '97.

06:26.875 --> 06:28.834
Started their company in '98.

06:28.917 --> 06:32.709
IPO December '98,
peak of the dotcom boom.

06:32.792 --> 06:35.000
- Try bubble, Nick.
- Theirs sure popped.

06:35.083 --> 06:36.291
Top of the world
for two months

06:36.375 --> 06:38.250
then quick slide into nothin'.

06:38.333 --> 06:40.125
Amy dies in May

06:40.208 --> 06:41.834
just before they close
the doors.

06:41.917 --> 06:44.792
Well, how's the coroner
explain
heart failure at 24?

06:44.875 --> 06:46.250
"Stress-induced."

06:46.333 --> 06:50.041
The company was losing
$200,000 a day by then.

06:50.125 --> 06:51.333
How about drugs?

06:51.417 --> 06:53.208
None in her system.

06:53.291 --> 06:55.291
But standard autopsy
doesn't test for
poison.

06:55.375 --> 06:57.667
Our diarist's method of choice.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.709
I start with Scott,
Amy's partner.

06:59.792 --> 07:02.125
He can tell you
who was on those computers.

07:02.208 --> 07:03.834
Other angle is the poison.

07:03.917 --> 07:06.041
Maybe exhume the body?
Test again?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.250
Need family's permission.

07:08.333 --> 07:10.959
Umm, there's a
sister,
Alora.

07:11.041 --> 07:12.166
Local.

07:12.250 --> 07:13.291
Good.

07:18.750 --> 07:19.792
(Alora)
'You have my permission,
sure.'

07:19.875 --> 07:21.458
'Whatever you need to do.'

07:21.542 --> 07:23.667
(Jeffries)
'Well, it's likely
with a new autopsy'

07:23.750 --> 07:25.458
we'll get new information.

07:25.542 --> 07:27.625
You really think
someone poisoned her?

07:27.709 --> 07:29.500
Someone sure wrote about it.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.875
(Jeffries)
'Was there anyone
at her office'

07:30.959 --> 07:32.500
she had a problem with?

07:32.583 --> 07:34.000
I wouldn't know.

07:34.083 --> 07:35.875
She was living here,
but after she and
Scott

07:35.959 --> 07:38.792
got the venture capital money,
I almost never saw her.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.583
Business took up
all of her time?

07:40.667 --> 07:44.417
She worked late every night,
went rowing every morning.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.667
If I saw her,
she was asleep right there.

07:48.959 --> 07:50.750
Couch surfing, she called it.

07:51.709 --> 07:53.333
What about this Scott?

07:53.417 --> 07:55.750
Were they involved at all?

07:55.834 --> 07:59.125
I don't think Amy
would have said no but..

07:59.208 --> 08:01.750
...Scott liked them
busty and adoring.

08:01.834 --> 08:03.208
'That wasn't Amy.'

08:03.291 --> 08:04.583
So, strictly business.

08:05.917 --> 08:08.709
She said they made
the perfect team.

08:08.792 --> 08:11.417
'Scott had the flash,
got the attention.'

08:11.500 --> 08:13.417
Amy knew how to close a deal.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.625
Ever see the two
of them in
action?

08:15.709 --> 08:17.583
I was here
when they first got funded.

08:17.667 --> 08:19.875
Their whole world
changed in a day.

08:24.041 --> 08:27.709
(Coleman)
Well, interesting idea.

08:27.792 --> 08:31.208
But, uh, how are you
gonna
make it work exactly?

08:31.291 --> 08:33.166
Two Wharton graduates,
summa cum laude

08:33.250 --> 08:34.583
we'll find a way.

08:34.667 --> 08:36.667
[chuckles]
Good packaging, I
admit

08:36.750 --> 08:38.917
but, uh, it's not
really an answer.

08:42.125 --> 08:45.333
It's 3:00 a.m.
Your child's having a seizure.

08:45.417 --> 08:47.500
He's speaking gibberish.
You need help.

08:47.583 --> 08:48.709
Uh-huh.

08:48.792 --> 08:50.417
(Amy)
'You go online.'

08:50.500 --> 08:51.792
What's happening with this boy?

08:52.959 --> 08:53.917
And there we are.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.417
Lionstaff.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.834
Type in the symptoms, get
answers in a matter of
seconds.

08:58.917 --> 09:01.709
And instructions
how to help him.

09:01.792 --> 09:04.125
It's a lofty goal,
helping people.

09:04.208 --> 09:06.417
And a sound business idea.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.959
The users will be desperate.

09:09.041 --> 09:10.250
Desperate people pay.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.208
Well, I gotta tell you

09:17.291 --> 09:18.959
'when I was your age,
the only thing'

09:19.041 --> 09:21.417
I had going on
in my garage was..

09:21.500 --> 09:22.500
...a band.

09:25.333 --> 09:26.291
What do you think?

09:28.166 --> 09:29.792
I'm in.

09:29.875 --> 09:31.041
How much?

09:31.125 --> 09:32.333
Oh!

09:33.500 --> 09:35.709
How's a million sound?

09:43.834 --> 09:45.917
After that,
they rented the
office

09:46.000 --> 09:47.667
and she was
pretty much
gone.

09:48.750 --> 09:50.250
But she kept living here?

09:50.333 --> 09:51.792
Yes.

09:51.875 --> 09:53.542
Eating ramen.

09:53.625 --> 09:55.333
'I told her,
"Honey, you're a
millionaire.'

09:55.417 --> 09:58.583
If I were you, I'd be setting
up
house on the Main Line."

09:58.667 --> 10:00.417
Sounds like a tough lady.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.667
Desperate people and all.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.375
No.

10:04.458 --> 10:06.375
You should understand
the reason

10:06.458 --> 10:08.041
Amy wanted this company.

10:09.917 --> 10:11.834
'We had a brother, Gage.'

10:11.917 --> 10:14.166
He died just before
he turned ten.

10:14.250 --> 10:16.500
The pictures on the table.

10:16.583 --> 10:19.875
When she talked about being
online at 3:00 in the morning

10:19.959 --> 10:21.625
she was talking
about herself.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.834
(Scott)
'You saying Amy didn't have
a heart attack?'

10:26.917 --> 10:29.625
Well, she did, but someone
might have helped her
along.

10:31.917 --> 10:33.166
I guess anything's possible.

10:34.208 --> 10:35.458
Those days were crazy.

10:35.542 --> 10:36.542
How so?

10:36.625 --> 10:39.083
You're 24,
too young to rent a
car.

10:39.166 --> 10:41.667
You can't imagine
being a
multimillionaire.

10:41.750 --> 10:43.208
Can't imagine
your friends would
die.

10:43.291 --> 10:45.208
Yeah, but then you are,
and they do.

10:45.291 --> 10:47.083
And then you lose it all.

10:48.834 --> 10:52.208
It was a wild ride.
And I was lucky.

10:52.291 --> 10:53.959
Couldn't have taken it
without her.

10:54.041 --> 10:55.291
Now?

10:56.458 --> 10:58.625
Amy had the ideas.

10:58.709 --> 11:00.417
I did the dog and pony show.

11:00.500 --> 11:01.667
'She did the head work.'

11:01.750 --> 11:03.583
Anyone around
who felt different?

11:03.667 --> 11:05.166
You mean,
did she have enemies?

11:06.625 --> 11:09.500
Yeah, we called them employees.

11:19.959 --> 11:22.166
Malvinder has something
he'd like to discuss.

11:22.250 --> 11:24.208
- Okay.
- 'He came to me.'

11:24.291 --> 11:26.291
I told him
he had to talk to both of
us.

11:26.375 --> 11:28.166
'Go on, Mal.'

11:28.250 --> 11:30.083
I wanna be made partner.

11:30.166 --> 11:32.291
- Partner?
- 'I'm building your
system.'

11:32.375 --> 11:34.250
Without me,
you have no business.

11:34.333 --> 11:38.041
Well, your work
has been really creative.

11:38.125 --> 11:40.333
- It sure has.
- Thank you.

11:40.417 --> 11:42.667
But Scott and I
started the business.

11:42.750 --> 11:44.583
It's ours.

11:44.667 --> 11:46.917
- So I don't matter?
- You do.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.417
That's why
you pull a big salary.

11:50.875 --> 11:54.625
Sorry.
Guess it's no can
do.

11:54.709 --> 11:56.291
Okay, we'll revisit this later?

11:56.375 --> 11:58.917
There are only two partners
of Lionstaff

11:59.000 --> 12:00.875
Scott and me.

12:00.959 --> 12:02.333
I get the picture.

12:03.875 --> 12:05.959
Ghasty. Idiot woman!

12:08.875 --> 12:12.208
I admit I leaned on her
for the bad cop stuff.

12:12.291 --> 12:13.542
I don't enjoy saying no.

12:13.625 --> 12:16.000
That word Malvinder used.

12:16.083 --> 12:17.208
Ghastly?

12:17.291 --> 12:19.333
Hindi for whore.

12:20.709 --> 12:22.667
We learned a few variations.

12:22.750 --> 12:25.458
Malvinder sounds
like an angry guy.

12:25.542 --> 12:27.375
And he sounds like our diarist.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.875
ghasty

12:40.959 --> 12:42.000
Recognize that?

12:42.083 --> 12:44.083
<i>Ghasty.</i>

12:44.166 --> 12:45.375
What is this?

12:45.458 --> 12:49.417
Came off a computer
from Lionstaff, 1999.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.792
So because there's a Hindi
word,
I must have written it?

12:51.875 --> 12:53.834
- Did you?
- No.

12:53.917 --> 12:56.208
So how come it sounds like you?

12:56.291 --> 12:58.667
Everyone in that office
picked up my swear words.

12:58.750 --> 13:01.375
Yeah, but you had
a real beef with
Amy.

13:01.458 --> 13:02.834
You wanted to be made partner.

13:02.917 --> 13:03.834
She said no.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.125
(Rush)
'Hard on you?'

13:05.208 --> 13:06.792
Having a woman
turn you down?

13:08.000 --> 13:09.709
That whole time
was hard for me.

13:09.792 --> 13:13.583
New country, no friends,
trying to send money home.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.375
My behavior wasn't too..

13:15.458 --> 13:18.875
[sighs]
...graceful,
but not this.

13:18.959 --> 13:22.375
So you didn't carry a grudge
over her shuttin' you down?

13:22.458 --> 13:25.709
I was lucky not to get caught
between her and Scott.

13:25.792 --> 13:28.166
I thought they were friends.

13:28.250 --> 13:29.959
Started that way.

13:30.041 --> 13:31.709
When the big money came..

13:31.792 --> 13:32.917
...war.

13:34.417 --> 13:36.375
(Amy)
Is it true?

13:36.458 --> 13:38.375
You bought a Ferrari?

13:38.458 --> 13:39.583
Why not?

13:39.667 --> 13:40.542
King crab roll?

13:40.625 --> 13:42.041
Scott, the way you're spending

13:42.125 --> 13:43.709
we can't afford any setbacks.

13:43.792 --> 13:45.792
I don't plan on any.

13:45.875 --> 13:47.959
And I have a great new idea
for us.

13:48.041 --> 13:49.000
What's that?

13:49.083 --> 13:50.709
Super Bowl ad.

13:50.792 --> 13:53.917
A million five for 30 secs.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.709
A million five is more
than we started with.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.125
'And we've grown.'

13:58.208 --> 14:00.208
I have a good feeling
about this.

14:00.291 --> 14:01.959
We're not doing it, Scott.

14:02.041 --> 14:03.208
Too late.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.041
It's done.

14:10.834 --> 14:12.250
Beginning of the fireworks.

14:12.333 --> 14:15.083
So he made a million dollar
decision without her?

14:15.166 --> 14:16.125
And it was a flop.

14:16.208 --> 14:17.542
No takers from the ad?

14:17.625 --> 14:20.625
We got lots of hits,
but zero business.

14:20.709 --> 14:22.750
Suddenly, we're three million
in the hole.

14:22.834 --> 14:25.166
[sighs]
No wonder she was miffed.

14:25.250 --> 14:27.208
That's when the business
started to slide.

14:27.291 --> 14:28.834
Throw downs between
Scott and Amy.

14:28.917 --> 14:30.625
They escalate?

14:30.709 --> 14:32.083
Into silence.

14:32.166 --> 14:33.542
Like a shout.

14:37.333 --> 14:39.500
Scott said he and
Amy
were friends.

14:39.583 --> 14:41.959
Opposite was true
according
to this Malvinder dude.

14:42.041 --> 14:43.709
Let me guess.
They fell out over money?

14:43.792 --> 14:45.125
Not that Scott told us that.

14:45.208 --> 14:46.542
Sounds like a re-interview.

14:47.542 --> 14:48.625
News from the ME.

14:48.709 --> 14:50.208
Amy's body had eight times

14:50.291 --> 14:52.917
the normal level
of potassium chloride.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.667
- That a poison?
- Not normally.

14:54.750 --> 14:57.166
But a high enough dose
induces heart attack.

14:57.250 --> 14:58.542
And how is it ingested?

14:58.625 --> 14:59.792
Dissolves in water.

14:59.875 --> 15:01.250
Kicks in within half an hour.

15:01.333 --> 15:02.959
So she probably drank it
that morning.

15:03.041 --> 15:04.792
Points to someone close.

15:04.875 --> 15:06.709
Now, new questions
for the sister.

15:09.625 --> 15:13.458
New autopsy shows your sister
was poisoned, Alora.

15:13.542 --> 15:16.166
- With potassium chloride.
- 'Hmm.'

15:16.250 --> 15:18.750
Oh, you know what that is,
I bet being a..

15:18.834 --> 15:21.375
...chemistry teacher,
and all.

15:21.458 --> 15:22.458
Yes.

15:22.542 --> 15:23.959
Know who could have been
with her

15:24.041 --> 15:25.834
6:30 that morning?

15:25.917 --> 15:27.458
No idea.

15:27.542 --> 15:29.458
And how about you?

15:29.542 --> 15:31.834
So we disagreed
on how to spend money?

15:31.917 --> 15:33.792
So you say that like
it's no big deal.

15:34.917 --> 15:36.166
In my line of work

15:36.250 --> 15:37.834
when people fight about money

15:37.917 --> 15:39.208
it usually don't end too well.

15:39.291 --> 15:41.000
I'm not some
street corner thug.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.208
So you got some more refined way
of getting what you want?

15:46.917 --> 15:48.208
'Hands off?'

15:49.166 --> 15:50.792
Poison, maybe?

15:50.875 --> 15:53.000
Why would I want my sister dead?

15:53.083 --> 15:55.041
Little hard living
next
to all that success

15:55.125 --> 15:57.417
none of it being yours.

15:57.500 --> 15:58.625
I was proud of her.

15:58.709 --> 16:00.959
Pride can turn
to envy on a dime.

16:02.250 --> 16:04.875
After Gage died,
Amy was all I had.

16:06.417 --> 16:08.875
Sisters have to stick together.

16:08.959 --> 16:10.583
Well, if not you,
Alora,
then who?

16:10.667 --> 16:13.041
- At 6:30 a.m.?
- I don't know.

16:13.125 --> 16:14.291
She row with anyone?

16:14.375 --> 16:15.709
No.

16:15.792 --> 16:17.208
The river was her place.

16:18.208 --> 16:20.041
She went there alone.

16:20.125 --> 16:23.083
No boyfriend?
Anyone who stayed over?

16:23.166 --> 16:25.125
Amy was driven, focused.

16:25.208 --> 16:27.458
It wasn't attractive
to a lot of guys.

16:29.125 --> 16:31.208
'She got a kitten
when she moved in.'

16:32.458 --> 16:34.083
I always joked
it was gonna be her

16:34.166 --> 16:36.291
her career
and her beloved cats.

16:38.458 --> 16:40.583
(Scott)
'My true feeling..'

16:40.667 --> 16:42.083
Amy died of a broken heart.

16:43.375 --> 16:44.750
She never got over Gage.

16:44.834 --> 16:48.291
- Convenient theory for you.
- We were partners.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.625
I wouldn't profit
from hurting her.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.041
No?

16:51.125 --> 16:53.083
And ultimately, we had
the same wolf at our
door.

16:54.291 --> 16:55.750
That wolf being..

16:55.834 --> 16:57.000
Coleman.

16:58.083 --> 16:59.792
After the Super Bowl fiasco..

17:01.458 --> 17:04.083
...he rained fire
on both our heads.

17:16.750 --> 17:18.542
I thought you were
gonna sell that.

17:18.625 --> 17:20.083
I'm not giving up the car.

17:20.166 --> 17:21.250
Makes an impression.

17:21.333 --> 17:22.750
How are you keeping
up payments?

17:22.834 --> 17:24.583
Another loan?

17:24.667 --> 17:25.917
Mom.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.208
Lay off.

17:27.291 --> 17:28.583
(Coleman)
'Scott!'

17:28.667 --> 17:30.542
Amy!

17:30.625 --> 17:32.333
I buy that?

17:32.417 --> 17:34.208
- Excuse me?
- Whoo!

17:34.291 --> 17:36.083
You've just been throwing
my money around

17:36.166 --> 17:37.583
like confetti, haven't you?

17:37.667 --> 17:38.959
(Amy)
'Is this about the ad,
Cliff?'

17:39.041 --> 17:40.125
You think this is a game?

17:40.208 --> 17:42.083
- 'Monopoly?'
- Of course not.

17:42.166 --> 17:45.083
I give you a million dollars
that I've earned

17:45.166 --> 17:47.792
'sweating and bleeding,
and you spend it on cars.'

17:47.875 --> 17:50.792
- Watches, sushi.
- Appearances matter.

17:50.875 --> 17:54.500
Then you get around
to an actual business decision

17:54.583 --> 17:57.875
and you blow your wad
on one ad?

17:57.959 --> 18:00.208
We thought the exposure
was worth the gamble.

18:02.125 --> 18:04.917
- 'No! No.'
- Oh, my God!

18:05.041 --> 18:07.333
Whose stupid idea was this?

18:07.417 --> 18:08.583
It was a joint decision.

18:08.667 --> 18:10.959
- It was a fiasco.
- We're sorry.

18:11.041 --> 18:12.500
You let another one get by you..

18:13.417 --> 18:14.709
...I'll do worse than this.

18:23.375 --> 18:25.125
He had a right to be mad, but..

18:26.166 --> 18:27.542
...he was psycho mad.

18:27.625 --> 18:30.583
Sounds like you ducked for
cover
and let him blame Amy.

18:33.041 --> 18:34.542
Not exactly me at my best.

18:36.417 --> 18:37.625
News.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.000
I got some background
on Cliff Coleman.

18:47.083 --> 18:48.959
Me too.
He's got a rage problem.

18:49.041 --> 18:51.750
Well, he also had a rich
wife.
In '94, she died.

18:51.834 --> 18:53.583
- Of a heart attack.
- Like Amy.

18:53.667 --> 18:56.166
Plus Coleman has
a medical condition, kidneys.

18:56.250 --> 18:58.792
Which is managed
by potassium
chloride..

18:58.875 --> 19:00.542
...in a steady daily dose.

19:07.959 --> 19:09.625
(Mayes)
'Dante, we got two witnesses'

19:09.709 --> 19:11.875
'say you grabbed
Angela Stimson by the hair.'

19:11.959 --> 19:13.208
'Tossed her off the bridge.'

19:14.208 --> 19:16.208
Yeah, I know.

19:16.291 --> 19:17.542
I was there.

19:18.750 --> 19:20.041
Wanna say why?

19:21.375 --> 19:23.208
I had to.

19:23.291 --> 19:24.291
You had to?

19:24.375 --> 19:26.208
Some people just gotta go off.

19:26.291 --> 19:27.542
What people?

19:27.625 --> 19:28.917
Girls.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.166
Long hair.
Wrong in the
head.

19:32.250 --> 19:34.917
So it wasn't just Angela had
to
go over, there were others?

19:37.250 --> 19:38.417
A lot of girls.

19:43.625 --> 19:45.208
How about her?

19:46.875 --> 19:48.000
(Dante)
'Yeah.'

19:48.083 --> 19:49.917
Oh, yeah.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.208
Are we talking last winter?

19:51.291 --> 19:52.583
You see her and decide
she had to go?

19:52.667 --> 19:53.917
'Cause she ain't
right
in the mind.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.250
- How do you know that?
- She talked to me.

19:56.333 --> 19:57.917
Yeah?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.333
(Dante)
'Wanted to get
to her boyfriend's house.'

20:00.417 --> 20:03.166
'He lived all the way
across town.'

20:03.250 --> 20:05.709
But her car was broke, and..

20:05.792 --> 20:08.333
... he ain't
picking
up the phone,
so..

20:08.417 --> 20:10.333
...she's walking
when I meet her.

20:11.875 --> 20:14.041
So why does that make you
throw her in the river?

20:14.125 --> 20:15.667
(Dante)
'She don't listen.'

20:18.458 --> 20:20.291
Why does she got
to love that guy?

20:21.500 --> 20:23.250
'He don't love her
like I do.'

20:23.333 --> 20:24.667
Uh, who are you talking about,
Dante?

20:24.750 --> 20:26.834
Angela.

20:26.917 --> 20:29.375
I wrote her letters with
my heart poured out on
'em.

20:29.458 --> 20:31.667
I loved her so bad.

20:31.750 --> 20:33.625
- So you know Angela?
- I followed her every day.

20:33.709 --> 20:35.333
I was her guardian angel.

20:35.417 --> 20:37.166
(Mayes)
'And the other girls?'

20:37.250 --> 20:38.959
There were no other girls.

20:43.208 --> 20:45.250
Elisa didn't drive, she..

20:45.333 --> 20:48.208
...never had a car. We lived
six blocks from each other.

20:48.291 --> 20:50.625
(Dante)
'Angela should be arrested.'

20:50.709 --> 20:53.000
'Cause she took my heart.

20:53.083 --> 20:54.834
You think she'll
ever
forgive me?

20:55.959 --> 20:57.583
It ain't him.

20:57.667 --> 20:59.166
I killed her.

20:59.250 --> 21:01.542
- Sorry, Scotty.
- Angie..

21:14.125 --> 21:15.792
It will just be a moment.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.417
Coffee or tea, sir?

21:22.333 --> 21:23.250
Sir.

21:23.333 --> 21:24.959
Officers.

21:25.041 --> 21:26.417
Hello.

21:26.500 --> 21:27.834
Oh, nice digs you have here.

21:27.917 --> 21:30.667
I have the privilege
of being a fortunate
man.

21:30.750 --> 21:33.375
Got some questions
about that fortune.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.917
It came from your wife's
family,
we understand.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.166
Guilty.

21:37.250 --> 21:38.291
Please.

21:43.083 --> 21:44.417
And how did she die?

21:45.417 --> 21:47.375
Heart failure.

21:47.458 --> 21:49.709
The loss of my life.

21:49.792 --> 21:51.792
You know,
Amy Lind died the same way.

21:52.667 --> 21:54.291
Coincidence, huh?

21:54.375 --> 21:57.083
Yes, both were tragedies.

21:57.166 --> 21:58.125
Why are you here?

21:58.208 --> 22:00.208
We're looking into Amy's death.

22:00.291 --> 22:02.041
We hear you bitched her
and Scott out.

22:02.125 --> 22:03.750
'Pretty bad at one point.'

22:03.834 --> 22:06.000
(Coleman)
'Gotta breathe fire once
in a while.'

22:06.083 --> 22:07.709
Make people jump.

22:07.792 --> 22:09.709
Gotta smash cars too, huh?

22:09.792 --> 22:11.875
Oh, that.

22:11.959 --> 22:14.667
[sighs]
The reason I was so..

22:14.750 --> 22:18.125
...mad at Amy was
she knew better.

22:18.208 --> 22:20.583
And the golf club,
that was your way of saying
it.

22:20.667 --> 22:23.959
Oh, I told her
more calmly again.

22:24.041 --> 22:25.792
[chuckles]
Right here.

22:28.500 --> 22:32.333
I'm sorry about my
outburst
in the parking lot.

22:32.417 --> 22:33.750
- Wasn't my car.
- Good of you.

22:33.834 --> 22:36.041
- To give me a second chance.
- Sure.

22:36.125 --> 22:38.917
Geraldine, thank you,
and hold all calls.

22:41.500 --> 22:43.709
Again, I'm really sorry
about the ad.

22:43.792 --> 22:46.375
It wasn't your idea,
was it?

22:48.333 --> 22:50.208
I believe..

22:50.291 --> 22:53.458
...that Lionstaff
can succeed, Amy.

22:53.542 --> 22:56.208
But I don't think
it can succeed with Scott.

22:58.083 --> 22:59.125
Mr. Coleman.

22:59.208 --> 23:01.625
You're a
rescuer,
I see that.

23:01.709 --> 23:03.500
First your
brother,
now Scott.

23:03.583 --> 23:04.792
That's fine.

23:04.875 --> 23:07.125
'But when push comes to shove'

23:07.208 --> 23:09.625
you gotta save yourself.

23:09.709 --> 23:11.625
He's my partner.

23:11.709 --> 23:13.291
Amy..

23:13.375 --> 23:15.625
...your company is like..

23:15.709 --> 23:18.083
...a hot air balloon.

23:18.166 --> 23:20.250
It's rising.
It's way up.

23:20.333 --> 23:22.250
But it's coming
to a mountain.

23:22.333 --> 23:26.000
You cut a sandbag,
you can stay up in the
sky.

23:26.083 --> 23:28.750
You keep that sandbag, and..

23:28.834 --> 23:31.458
...it brings the whole
thing
crashing down.

23:31.542 --> 23:33.458
Scott's not a sandbag.

23:33.542 --> 23:34.875
He's dead weight.

23:34.959 --> 23:38.792
He's showing of.
He's, uh, seduced by
trappings.

23:38.875 --> 23:40.166
He deserves to be cut out.

23:40.250 --> 23:42.125
We're best friends
from business school.

23:42.208 --> 23:43.500
- We've been together since--
- Honey.

23:43.583 --> 23:45.166
That's sentiment.
This is business.

23:45.250 --> 23:47.458
Your next appointment
is here, Mr. Coleman.

23:51.417 --> 23:52.709
Go home.

23:52.792 --> 23:54.458
Get out of here.
You're a child.

23:55.917 --> 23:57.125
Excuse me?

23:57.208 --> 23:58.667
Miss, don't get hysterical

23:58.750 --> 24:01.792
and don't raise your voice
to Mr. Coleman.

24:10.208 --> 24:12.333
Moral of the story.

24:12.417 --> 24:14.792
Don't do business
with kids.

24:14.875 --> 24:16.083
They're emotional.

24:17.291 --> 24:19.166
And the millions they cost you

24:19.250 --> 24:20.709
no feelings about that?

24:20.792 --> 24:22.458
Oh, venture capital
is gambling.

24:22.542 --> 24:25.667
I knew standing in that
garage,
I was just..

24:25.750 --> 24:27.500
...layin' a bet.

24:27.583 --> 24:29.542
Excuse me. Powder room.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.333
Coffee?

24:42.959 --> 24:44.083
Thank you.

24:49.125 --> 24:50.458
You didn't like Amy, did you?

24:52.250 --> 24:53.959
She wasn't
interested
in being liked.

24:55.208 --> 24:56.583
By you?

24:56.667 --> 24:58.375
By anyone.

24:58.458 --> 25:00.417
That's what they teach
girls
these days

25:00.500 --> 25:02.291
to be hard, aggressive.

25:04.125 --> 25:05.625
Mannish.

25:08.959 --> 25:11.417
Coleman seemed to have
a high opinion.

25:11.500 --> 25:13.709
He always looks
for the good in
people.

25:15.083 --> 25:16.959
And you?

25:17.041 --> 25:18.625
I just try to look after him.

25:20.834 --> 25:24.417
Anyway, Amy was busy enough
carrying on with a married
man.

25:26.458 --> 25:27.625
Really?

25:27.709 --> 25:29.417
Every time I went
by
that office, I saw
it.

25:29.500 --> 25:31.417
She had him wrapped
around her finger.

25:31.500 --> 25:33.208
Who are we talking about?

25:33.291 --> 25:34.458
That Indian.

25:36.041 --> 25:39.625
But I suppose to every feminist,
a man's just a toy on a string.

25:45.083 --> 25:47.625
- 'So Amy and you.'
- Just me.

25:47.709 --> 25:49.875
It was the one way kind.

25:49.959 --> 25:51.875
I thought you hated her, Mal.

25:51.959 --> 25:53.333
Not making you a partner.

25:53.417 --> 25:55.709
That was before
I worked with
her.

25:55.792 --> 25:57.166
Spent time with her.

25:57.250 --> 25:58.625
And your wife?

25:58.709 --> 26:00.333
My marriage was arranged.

26:02.500 --> 26:03.709
They still doin' that?

26:04.792 --> 26:06.542
My family's traditional.

26:06.625 --> 26:09.125
So you were
pretty much strangers.

26:10.625 --> 26:12.291
Home was..

26:12.375 --> 26:14.208
...an awkward place.

26:14.291 --> 26:15.875
I was more
comfortable
with Amy.

26:15.959 --> 26:17.333
She know how you feel?

26:19.250 --> 26:22.417
Love, it's hard
to keep to yourself.

26:30.125 --> 26:31.417
Is this seat taken?

26:32.583 --> 26:34.583
Someone's shorting our stock

26:34.667 --> 26:36.667
betting against us.

26:36.750 --> 26:38.542
I have something
I must tell you.

26:38.625 --> 26:40.625
I'm gonna find out who.

26:40.709 --> 26:42.333
If it's anyone inside

26:42.417 --> 26:44.166
my next call is to the SEC.

26:44.250 --> 26:46.125
There's a book.

26:46.208 --> 26:47.750
It is called "Out Of Africa."

26:50.417 --> 26:51.667
Thanks, Malvinder.

26:51.750 --> 26:53.375
It is about a young woman

26:53.458 --> 26:56.333
obliged to marry
and move far from home.

26:56.417 --> 26:57.667
There's a movie, right?

26:57.750 --> 27:00.375
She is lonely,
but she is very brave

27:00.458 --> 27:02.583
and she works very hard.

27:02.667 --> 27:04.208
She reminds me of you.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.709
Malvinder, thank you.

27:08.792 --> 27:10.291
I am also from far away

27:10.375 --> 27:11.750
and I am also alone.

27:11.834 --> 27:13.208
Didn't you just get married?

27:16.375 --> 27:19.166
Well, you see, it's that..

27:22.291 --> 27:23.250
...I love you.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.208
I've been there.

27:31.291 --> 27:32.625
(Malvinder)
'Thanks.'

27:34.583 --> 27:36.500
Did your wife know?

27:39.875 --> 27:41.375
It's why she wrote the diary.

27:42.750 --> 27:44.959
Uh, back up, your
wife
wrote that diary?

27:45.041 --> 27:47.542
She was new to the
country,
all alone.

27:47.625 --> 27:50.959
She could see I was thinking
about someone else.

27:51.041 --> 27:53.000
(Jeffries)
'How did she know it was Amy?'

27:53.083 --> 27:56.709
I suppose I talked
about her a lot.

27:56.792 --> 27:59.667
She wrote that on the computer
I took to and from work.

27:59.750 --> 28:01.583
There's some serious things
said in that diary.

28:01.667 --> 28:04.125
I know but Mopali
was no threat to Amy.

28:04.208 --> 28:07.250
The morning Amy died, my wife
and I were in Bangalore,
India.

28:07.333 --> 28:09.250
We'll need to see
your passports.

28:09.333 --> 28:11.500
- Yes, sir.
- It must've been quite a
scene.

28:11.583 --> 28:13.250
When you found out
what she wrote.

28:14.792 --> 28:17.667
She talked, I listened.

28:17.750 --> 28:19.750
After four months of marriage

28:19.834 --> 28:21.125
we finally met.

28:37.709 --> 28:39.625
(Stillman)
You heading home, Scotty?

28:41.125 --> 28:42.750
Uh, no, I was just..

28:42.834 --> 28:44.125
...takin' a sec.

28:44.208 --> 28:47.417
Those SEC financials
are making us cross-eyed.

28:48.875 --> 28:51.917
You're looking for who
was shorting Amy's
stock?

28:52.000 --> 28:54.375
No, looking for one guy
in particular.

28:54.458 --> 28:55.667
It's Coleman.

28:56.542 --> 28:58.041
'I figure he lost a pile'

28:58.125 --> 28:59.625
betting on Amy and Scott.

28:59.709 --> 29:02.250
Maybe he tried to make it
back playin' dirty.

29:07.583 --> 29:09.083
How did it go over at West?

29:14.583 --> 29:15.667
It was okay.

29:18.750 --> 29:20.333
Interviewed a guy

29:20.417 --> 29:22.208
Mayes brought in.

29:22.291 --> 29:24.083
Thought maybe
there was a connect

29:24.166 --> 29:25.709
to Elisa there.

29:35.583 --> 29:36.792
Just didn't pan out.

29:40.917 --> 29:42.458
Oh, Scotty,
you're not gonna know.

29:44.333 --> 29:46.166
Not next year,
not the year after.

29:47.417 --> 29:48.750
Yeah, so lay it to rest?

29:51.834 --> 29:53.792
Saving grace heals the pains.

29:56.834 --> 29:58.417
I'm gonna go back up.

29:58.500 --> 30:00.208
- Sure.
- Goodnight.

30:23.625 --> 30:26.875
Can't we call some forensic
accountants to read this
stuff?

30:26.959 --> 30:30.125
This is worse
than those poems last
year.

30:30.208 --> 30:31.792
I think I found something.

30:34.417 --> 30:35.500
You serious?

30:35.583 --> 30:36.875
A HG Friday.

30:36.959 --> 30:39.417
Holding company with 9.8 mil.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.750
You got Coleman's name
attached to that?

30:41.834 --> 30:43.959
- Looking.
- That's gotta be illegal.

30:44.041 --> 30:45.834
Sure, he knew
the company was tanking.

30:45.917 --> 30:48.083
He bets against it.
Insider trading.

30:48.166 --> 30:50.417
So maybe Amy finds out,
calls him on it.

30:50.500 --> 30:53.500
And unless he's willing to go
to jail, he has to shut her
up.

30:53.583 --> 30:57.166
Good theory, but we're talking
about the wrong millionaire.

30:57.250 --> 31:01.917
Name attached to H.G. Friday
is Geraldine Wright.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.333
Coleman's secretary.

31:09.667 --> 31:12.166
(Rush)
'H.G. Friday.'

31:12.250 --> 31:14.959
- I don't know what that is.
- Who that is.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.041
His Girl Friday?

31:17.125 --> 31:18.834
A certain clever secretary

31:18.917 --> 31:21.834
with a $9.8 million nest egg.

31:23.959 --> 31:26.542
[sighs]
I've never seen
these before.

31:26.625 --> 31:28.000
(Valens)
'You know what I think?'

31:28.083 --> 31:29.375
I think, Geraldine pretends

31:29.458 --> 31:30.834
she doesn't know
anything
about business.

31:30.917 --> 31:32.625
Hmm, math is for men.

31:32.709 --> 31:34.458
(Valens)
'But I think
she understands perfectly.'

31:34.542 --> 31:37.625
I think she got filthy rich
playing dumb.

31:41.375 --> 31:45.291
I-I have $2,237

31:45.375 --> 31:47.458
in the bank. Also an IRA.

31:47.542 --> 31:50.125
Come on, Geraldine,
you hated Amy.

31:50.208 --> 31:52.792
Like you hate all
women
who are driven.

31:52.875 --> 31:54.458
Headstrong.

31:54.542 --> 31:56.000
Mannish.

31:56.083 --> 31:57.500
'The least you could do
was make some money'

31:57.583 --> 31:58.917
off the little chippie.

31:59.041 --> 32:00.834
So you shorted
stock
on her company.

32:00.917 --> 32:02.625
And when Amy caught
on to it

32:02.709 --> 32:05.125
you slipped her some
of Coleman's potassium
chloride.

32:05.208 --> 32:07.667
Probably in that
fine coffee of
yours.

32:07.750 --> 32:09.291
I don't understand.

32:11.417 --> 32:14.250
You can talk to my accountant,
Stephen Franklin.

32:14.333 --> 32:15.625
That's Coleman's accountant.

32:15.709 --> 32:17.291
He handles everything
for me too.

32:22.667 --> 32:24.875
Then I think you know how
your name got on this
paper.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.458
You're loyal, Geraldine.

32:31.375 --> 32:32.583
Doesn't mean he is.

32:34.792 --> 32:36.291
I looked after Mr. Coleman.

32:37.417 --> 32:40.750
I took care of his needs
for 22 years.

32:43.625 --> 32:45.542
I was his constant companion.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.709
I guess this is your reward.

32:49.792 --> 32:52.709
'Six years ago, he sets you up
for securities fraud.'

32:52.792 --> 32:55.542
And now, he sets you up
for murder.

32:58.625 --> 33:00.583
That girl thought she could
play with the big boys.

33:02.959 --> 33:04.333
She thought they'd play fair.

33:05.625 --> 33:07.667
- But?
- They didn't.

33:09.667 --> 33:10.959
And the knives came out.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.583
Mr. Sawyer.

33:15.667 --> 33:17.375
Amy found out.

33:17.458 --> 33:18.542
Found out what?

33:18.625 --> 33:20.291
About you shorting stock.

33:20.375 --> 33:22.792
You mean she found out
about us.

33:22.875 --> 33:25.208
(Scott)
'I don't think she knows
that..'

33:25.291 --> 33:26.625
...that it's me, too.

33:27.917 --> 33:30.542
- What's she doing?
- Calling the SEC.

33:30.625 --> 33:32.667
- That's prison.
- 'I know.'

33:32.750 --> 33:36.709
- It's bankruptcy, then
prison.
- Oh, God, I can't.

33:36.792 --> 33:38.542
We both know
there's no talking to her.

33:38.625 --> 33:40.709
She's so damn stubborn.

33:40.792 --> 33:42.125
So what do we do?

33:43.208 --> 33:44.458
Stop her.

33:45.917 --> 33:48.041
You know what happens
if we don't.

33:48.125 --> 33:50.417
'That Ferrari gets repoed.'

33:50.500 --> 33:52.083
'Condos emptied out.'

33:52.166 --> 33:53.750
You move in to the state pen.

33:58.166 --> 34:00.125
I can't. Not to her.

34:02.542 --> 34:03.750
Scott..

34:05.709 --> 34:08.083
...do you remember us
standing here a week ago

34:08.166 --> 34:10.166
talking about your future?

34:10.250 --> 34:12.458
- Yeah.
- What's your future like?

34:12.542 --> 34:14.083
A hot air balloon.

34:14.166 --> 34:17.208
And what did you say you'd do
if anything got in your way?

34:17.291 --> 34:20.792
If any sandbag started
dragging you down.

34:22.542 --> 34:24.417
I said..

34:24.500 --> 34:25.959
Go on.

34:26.041 --> 34:28.458
I said, "Whatever it is,
I'll chop that mother off".

34:38.417 --> 34:41.208
I guess I wanted to see her
get knocked down a peg.

34:42.875 --> 34:45.375
But she didn't get
knocked
down a peg, Geraldine.

34:46.875 --> 34:49.667
- She got killed.
- I know.

34:49.750 --> 34:52.041
She was killed
with Coleman's
medication.

34:52.125 --> 34:54.000
You...know that too.

34:56.041 --> 34:57.083
Yes.

34:58.583 --> 35:01.291
[sighs]
'I keep track
of his prescriptions.'

35:01.375 --> 35:04.000
I refilled that one
just before that meeting.

35:04.083 --> 35:05.291
And?

35:08.125 --> 35:09.417
In the afternoon...

35:11.125 --> 35:12.250
...it was gone.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.583
Are you packing up,
Scott?
That never looks good.

35:23.667 --> 35:25.333
I'm just going for the weekend.

35:25.417 --> 35:27.083
We know about you and Coleman.

35:27.166 --> 35:28.667
Know?

35:28.750 --> 35:31.333
That you were shorting stock
together behind Amy's back.

35:31.417 --> 35:34.417
H.G. Friday. Ring any bells?

35:34.500 --> 35:36.834
But Amy found out,
was going to report you.

35:36.917 --> 35:40.333
You're always one step
behind aren't you, Scott?

35:41.875 --> 35:43.875
'And now's your chance
to get ahead'

35:43.959 --> 35:45.542
so we're talking to you first

35:45.625 --> 35:47.375
before Coleman.

35:47.458 --> 35:49.667
- I don't have anything to
say.
- Really?

35:49.750 --> 35:51.583
'Cause I'm guessing
Coleman's fancy lawyers

35:51.667 --> 35:53.333
are gonna say
you stole his meds.

35:53.417 --> 35:54.667
No!

35:54.750 --> 35:56.917
Oh, he'll sell you out as easy
as you two sold out Amy.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.875
(Valens)
'He went to her first,
Scott.'

35:58.959 --> 36:01.250
Did you know that?
Tried to cut you out.

36:01.333 --> 36:03.041
But she said no.
She was loyal.

36:03.125 --> 36:05.959
You don't have to tell me how
much better than me Amy was.

36:08.125 --> 36:10.166
That's something
I knew all about.

36:10.250 --> 36:11.792
(Valens)
'Is that why you did it?'

36:11.875 --> 36:14.458
Sick of always coming up
a little short next to her?

36:14.542 --> 36:15.625
No.

36:17.208 --> 36:18.417
I was trapped.

36:19.917 --> 36:21.375
'I couldn't face jail.'

36:22.917 --> 36:24.750
And I couldn't face her
finding out.

36:27.875 --> 36:30.417
Coleman said, it would be fast.

36:30.500 --> 36:31.917
That he knew it would work.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.041
Yeah, because he did it
to his wife.

36:37.709 --> 36:39.542
He told me, I'd be a natural.

36:41.208 --> 36:42.917
'Cause all I had to do
was talk.

36:49.291 --> 36:51.333
You still do this every
morning
by yourself?

36:53.709 --> 36:55.709
Why?

36:55.792 --> 36:57.667
- Thinking about joining me?
- No.

36:57.750 --> 37:00.000
I get enough of workout
just looking at you.

37:03.667 --> 37:07.125
I came to say
the Super Bowl ad was dumb.

37:07.208 --> 37:08.625
We didn't know
it wouldn't work.

37:08.709 --> 37:11.000
I went about it wrong.
I should have worked with you.

37:12.750 --> 37:14.000
Thanks.

37:16.166 --> 37:17.291
Peace?

37:19.875 --> 37:22.208
I know you don't like
to buy them for
yourself.

37:29.625 --> 37:32.000
Lionstaff was a good idea.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.917
Was?

37:34.000 --> 37:35.792
We struck out on this one.

37:35.875 --> 37:37.333
We got stuck with a bad guy.

37:38.834 --> 37:40.667
'But it's okay.'

37:40.750 --> 37:42.500
Yeah?

37:42.583 --> 37:45.500
We just have to choose
our partners better next
time.

37:45.583 --> 37:47.458
I mean..

37:47.542 --> 37:49.542
...if you want to.

37:49.625 --> 37:51.250
Sure.

37:51.333 --> 37:52.834
It will be back to the garage.

37:52.917 --> 37:54.792
You and me is how
it worked best anyway.

37:54.875 --> 37:56.041
Yeah.

38:02.417 --> 38:04.166
You know, when I first
started coming here

38:04.250 --> 38:06.750
it was for Gage,
to think about him.

38:08.208 --> 38:10.834
But lately, I started
letting myself

38:10.917 --> 38:12.834
notice everything
that's alive

38:12.917 --> 38:14.709
here, now.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.333
And there's so much.

38:19.500 --> 38:21.208
I still love him

38:21.291 --> 38:23.000
but I think,
maybe now I'm ready to..

38:24.542 --> 38:26.709
...start having my own life,
you know?

38:26.792 --> 38:28.083
That's good.

38:28.166 --> 38:29.291
'Yeah.'

38:31.000 --> 38:34.250
So, thanks for sticking with me.

38:45.583 --> 38:46.709
Amy.

38:48.125 --> 38:49.250
Yeah?

38:54.208 --> 38:55.917
See you in the office.

38:57.750 --> 38:59.083
See you.
