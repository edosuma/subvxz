WEBVTT

00:07.341 --> 00:12.913
(indistinct conversing)

00:12.946 --> 00:14.014
Can you give it to me

00:14.048 --> 00:15.349
for 23,050?

00:15.383 --> 00:17.551
Oh, Mr. Cordova, I would love

00:17.585 --> 00:18.886
to, but my manager, he would eat

00:18.919 --> 00:19.887
my feet.

00:19.920 --> 00:20.821
But, you know what?

00:20.854 --> 00:23.191
I like you guys, so let me go

00:23.224 --> 00:25.393
talk to him.

00:25.426 --> 00:28.062
(phone ringing)

00:28.096 --> 00:28.729
Unbelievable!

00:28.762 --> 00:29.530
(glass breaking)

00:29.563 --> 00:30.898
Do you realize, when the

00:30.931 --> 00:32.666
manufacturer sends me these

00:32.700 --> 00:34.568
cars, I've got to meet a quota?

00:34.602 --> 00:35.269
Let me tell you something--

00:35.303 --> 00:36.737
a person is not a number!

00:36.770 --> 00:37.538
Taking weekend? out this

00:37.571 --> 00:38.372
Uh-huh.

00:38.406 --> 00:38.939
Oh, that'll be nice.

00:38.972 --> 00:39.607
Unbelievable!

00:39.640 --> 00:40.574
(glass breaking)

00:40.608 --> 00:41.409
I don't even know how you got--

00:41.442 --> 00:43.677
Dad, calm down.

00:43.711 --> 00:46.247
I'm about to get my first car.

00:46.280 --> 00:46.880
These people are like

00:46.914 --> 00:48.616
vultures.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.119
I hate dealerships.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.420
Me, too. Ha!

00:52.453 --> 00:53.754
And you'll hate them even more

00:53.787 --> 00:55.055
after I tell you the truth

00:55.089 --> 00:56.590
about them.

00:56.624 --> 00:57.691
What are you, like, another

00:57.725 --> 00:59.093
car salesman?

00:59.127 --> 01:00.861
You're dressed like one.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.396
That is a terrible thing to

01:02.430 --> 01:03.864
say to someone.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.567
Hi, I'm Adam Conover, and this

01:06.600 --> 01:11.405
is "Adam Ruins Everything."

01:11.439 --> 01:12.773
(crackling)

01:12.806 --> 01:13.907
(ding-ding)

01:13.941 --> 01:15.776
(buzzer)

01:15.809 --> 01:17.578

truTV

01:17.611 --> 01:19.280
Okay, you can't ruin cars.

01:19.313 --> 01:20.248
The car, like, represents

01:20.281 --> 01:21.449
freedom.

01:21.482 --> 01:22.783
Hmm, how can they represent

01:22.816 --> 01:24.652
freedom when you have no choice

01:24.685 --> 01:25.953
in where you buy them?

01:25.986 --> 01:27.788
Why is it that if you want a new

01:27.821 --> 01:29.457
car, you have to go to one of

01:29.490 --> 01:30.958
these awful dealerships?

01:30.991 --> 01:32.293
Doesn't that suck?

01:32.326 --> 01:35.329
Yes! I hate haggling!

01:35.363 --> 01:36.464
I hate driving from one

01:36.497 --> 01:37.331
dealership to the next

01:37.365 --> 01:38.399
dealership.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.500
I hate dealing with this guy!

01:39.533 --> 01:40.634
Hey!

01:40.668 --> 01:41.469
So, why do we buy cars

01:41.502 --> 01:42.670
this way?

01:42.703 --> 01:44.238
Like, why does every dealership

01:44.272 --> 01:46.140
only sell one brand of car?

01:46.174 --> 01:47.241
What if every business worked

01:47.275 --> 01:48.276
like that?

01:48.309 --> 01:49.577
Welcome to Peterman Clancy,

01:49.610 --> 01:50.778
serving all your Tom Clancy

01:50.811 --> 01:52.079
needs.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.314
I'd like "The Hunt for

01:53.347 --> 01:54.148
Red October."

01:54.182 --> 01:54.982
Oh, okay.

01:55.015 --> 01:55.983
Well, I can offer you a

01:56.016 --> 01:57.651
ten-chapter package for $20

01:57.685 --> 01:59.653
a month for 36 months.

01:59.687 --> 02:00.654
And would you like to add page

02:00.688 --> 02:02.290
strengthening?

02:02.323 --> 02:03.424
Why can't you just go to a

02:03.457 --> 02:05.293
car store and buy whatever brand

02:05.326 --> 02:06.160
of car you want for

02:06.194 --> 02:08.028
a fixed price?

02:08.061 --> 02:10.097
Do you have Toyota Camrys?

02:10.130 --> 02:12.433
Uh, sedans, Aisle 6, right

02:12.466 --> 02:13.667
next to the Accords.

02:13.701 --> 02:15.169
Oh, I do have coupons

02:15.203 --> 02:16.204
for those.

02:16.237 --> 02:17.371
And why can't you buy a car

02:17.405 --> 02:18.539
online?

02:18.572 --> 02:20.140
Hmm, never mind, it's cheaper

02:20.174 --> 02:21.209
on Amazon.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.843
"Add to Cart."

02:22.876 --> 02:23.711
Why isn't that how

02:23.744 --> 02:24.778
we buy cars?

02:24.812 --> 02:25.613
(laughs) Because that would

02:25.646 --> 02:26.547
be crazy.

02:26.580 --> 02:27.014
I mean, can you imagine such

02:27.047 --> 02:28.115
a world?

02:28.148 --> 02:29.183
Oh, boy, man, this guy, he sure

02:29.217 --> 02:30.017
is funny.

02:30.050 --> 02:30.518
You know, that would

02:30.551 --> 02:31.352
be great.

02:31.385 --> 02:32.186
Why can't I do that?

02:32.220 --> 02:33.187
Oh, because these guys got

02:33.221 --> 02:34.154
a law passed to stop you.

02:34.188 --> 02:35.223
Come on.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.690
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:36.724 --> 02:37.791
Please!

02:37.825 --> 02:38.692
Please don't talk about this!

02:38.726 --> 02:39.660
Dealerships aren't owned by

02:39.693 --> 02:40.861
the car makers.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.296
They're separate businesses.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.031
And since the 30s, dealership

02:44.064 --> 02:45.032
associations have pressured

02:45.065 --> 02:46.700
every state into passing

02:46.734 --> 02:48.536
"franchise laws" that give them

02:48.569 --> 02:50.304
a virtual monopoly over new

02:50.338 --> 02:51.705
car sales.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.040
That is a beautiful

02:53.073 --> 02:54.875
anti-competitive law, Senator!

02:54.908 --> 02:56.377
We are gonna make so much money

02:56.410 --> 02:57.745
off of this!

02:57.778 --> 02:59.179
These laws actually make it

02:59.213 --> 03:01.215
illegal to sell new cars unless

03:01.249 --> 03:02.650
you're a car dealership.

03:02.683 --> 03:03.317
And if you want to become a

03:03.351 --> 03:04.552
dealer... too bad.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.320
It's also illegal to open a new

03:06.354 --> 03:07.555
dealership in another dealer's

03:07.588 --> 03:09.423
territory.

03:09.457 --> 03:10.391
You are operating an

03:10.424 --> 03:11.559
unauthorized dealership!

03:11.592 --> 03:14.194
(sirens blaring)

03:14.228 --> 03:15.195
It's not actually that

03:15.229 --> 03:17.097
illegal, but you get the idea.

03:17.130 --> 03:18.599
And the law also makes it nearly

03:18.632 --> 03:20.501
impossible for car makers to

03:20.534 --> 03:22.270
shut down dealerships, even when

03:22.303 --> 03:23.437
they suck.

03:23.471 --> 03:24.905
Which means they end up getting

03:24.938 --> 03:26.707
passed from father to son like

03:26.740 --> 03:29.009
family dynasties.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.078
This top financing.

03:31.111 --> 03:32.413
Great job, son.

03:32.446 --> 03:33.881
Push those leather seats, okay?

03:33.914 --> 03:34.848
Since they have no

03:34.882 --> 03:36.584
competition and no oversight,

03:36.617 --> 03:37.918
car dealers are free to force

03:37.951 --> 03:38.952
you to haggle and treat you

03:38.986 --> 03:40.521
like crap.

03:40.554 --> 03:41.922
So, it's a lame law.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.257
Let's change it.

03:43.291 --> 03:44.392
That'll be tough.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.594
20% of state sales tax revenue

03:46.627 --> 03:47.928
comes from car dealerships,

03:47.961 --> 03:48.929
which means Quint and his

03:48.962 --> 03:50.097
buddies pretty much run

03:50.130 --> 03:51.399
the show.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.366
There you are, Senator.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.134
(chuckling)

03:54.167 --> 03:55.102
You own me.

03:55.135 --> 03:56.870
(both laughing)

03:56.904 --> 03:58.306
And all these middlemen do

03:58.339 --> 03:59.640
is cost you money.

03:59.673 --> 04:00.808
I knew it.

04:00.841 --> 04:01.942
It's estimated that if car

04:01.975 --> 04:03.143
manufacturers could sell to

04:03.176 --> 04:04.878
consumers directly, every car

04:04.912 --> 04:07.114
would be $1,800 cheaper.

04:07.147 --> 04:08.616
Gah!

04:08.649 --> 04:10.217
That'll be $1,800 to replace.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.219
Uh...

04:12.252 --> 04:13.754
I hate these guys.

04:13.787 --> 04:14.922
Yeah, but because of dealer

04:14.955 --> 04:15.789
franchise laws, you can't

04:15.823 --> 04:16.990
avoid them.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.426
If you want a new car, you have

04:18.459 --> 04:19.927
no choice.

04:19.960 --> 04:20.628
But, it's the only way to

04:20.661 --> 04:21.629
get around.

04:21.662 --> 04:23.297
I need a car.

04:23.331 --> 04:25.333
Yeah, so does everyone.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.634
Isn't it kind of weird that a

04:26.667 --> 04:28.268
product marketed as the epitome

04:28.302 --> 04:30.604
of freedom is totally mandatory?

04:30.638 --> 04:31.639
Hell, your government-issued

04:31.672 --> 04:33.974
I.D. is a driver's license.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.175
Well, mine's a learner's permit.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.009
I have bad depth perception,

04:36.043 --> 04:36.810
so I'm still practicing,

04:36.844 --> 04:37.978
you know?

04:38.011 --> 04:40.681
Well, that's the way it is.

04:40.714 --> 04:43.351
Man and car, forever locked

04:43.384 --> 04:44.652
in battle.

04:44.685 --> 04:45.185
Yeah, but it didn't

04:45.218 --> 04:46.454
have to be.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.455
Haven't you ever wondered why we

04:47.488 --> 04:48.456
built our transportation system

04:48.489 --> 04:49.289
this way?

04:49.323 --> 04:50.624
No.

04:50.658 --> 04:53.761
But... now, I do.

04:53.794 --> 04:54.194
Oh, you're a little curious?

04:54.227 --> 04:55.028
Yeah.

04:55.062 --> 04:55.996
Awesome!

04:56.029 --> 04:56.997
Well, the story begins when--

04:57.030 --> 04:57.665
Excuse me, I'm looking for

04:57.698 --> 04:58.966
a sedan.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.469
I don't work here!

05:01.502 --> 05:03.170
I have a pocket square!

05:03.203 --> 05:05.305
♪♪

05:07.708 --> 05:08.376
Here's the story of how the

05:08.409 --> 05:09.543
car took over the American

05:09.577 --> 05:11.812
street.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.481
A century ago, the city street

05:13.514 --> 05:15.148
was a public place that was open

05:15.182 --> 05:16.350
to everyone.

05:16.384 --> 05:17.951
It was shared by pedestrians,

05:17.985 --> 05:19.787
horses, and weird old-timey

05:19.820 --> 05:21.689
bicyclists alike, not to mention

05:21.722 --> 05:22.690
streetcars that took people

05:22.723 --> 05:23.791
to work.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.025
Now, Teddy, you have a fun

05:25.058 --> 05:26.026
day at the sweatshop.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.294
And remember, always walk in

05:27.327 --> 05:28.295
the street.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.863
It belongs to all of us.

05:29.897 --> 05:30.798
But when the car was

05:30.831 --> 05:32.533
invented, people started driving

05:32.566 --> 05:33.834
them at top speed through the

05:33.867 --> 05:35.035
crowded streets, and the results

05:35.068 --> 05:36.537
weren't pretty.

05:36.570 --> 05:37.738
(horn(crashing, screaming)chin

05:37.771 --> 05:38.906
My boy!

05:38.939 --> 05:40.140
He's dead!

05:40.173 --> 05:41.642
Oh, dear!

05:41.675 --> 05:42.410
So that's what happens when

05:42.443 --> 05:43.411
one's motor car strikes

05:43.444 --> 05:44.412
a peasant.

05:44.445 --> 05:45.813
Naturally, everyone blamed

05:45.846 --> 05:46.380
the new invention for the

05:46.414 --> 05:47.481
carnage.

05:47.515 --> 05:49.082
Seventh kid mashed by a metal

05:49.116 --> 05:50.818
death machine this week.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.386
Huh, maybe these things

05:52.420 --> 05:53.687
shouldn't be allowed.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.222
Public outcry grew.

05:55.255 --> 05:56.524
Extra! Extra!

05:56.557 --> 05:57.558
Innocent boy killed by

05:57.591 --> 05:58.692
automobile!

05:58.726 --> 06:00.060
And some cities even

06:00.093 --> 06:01.228
discussed passing laws

06:01.261 --> 06:02.229
against them.

06:02.262 --> 06:03.330
We propose that the streets

06:03.363 --> 06:04.565
not be filled with these

06:04.598 --> 06:05.866
high-speed two-ton metal

06:05.899 --> 06:07.668
projectiles.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.236
Hear, hear.

06:09.269 --> 06:13.173
We pay our taxes.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.174
They're killin' us out there!

06:14.207 --> 06:15.075
Well, technically, we're

06:15.108 --> 06:15.943
killing them, Bill.

06:15.976 --> 06:16.777
Ooh!

06:16.810 --> 06:17.745
Good point.

06:17.778 --> 06:18.912
We gotta fight this thing.

06:18.946 --> 06:19.680
I got it! (snaps fingers)

06:19.713 --> 06:20.380
We'll tell them the streets are

06:20.414 --> 06:21.682
for cars only.

06:21.715 --> 06:22.683
And if a car kills ya, it's your

06:22.716 --> 06:23.617
own fault.

06:23.651 --> 06:24.418
And we'll give the folks that

06:24.452 --> 06:25.519
walk in the street a really

06:25.553 --> 06:26.787
humiliating nickname.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.422
What about "Irish walkers"?

06:28.456 --> 06:29.623
Now, that's pretty cruel,

06:29.657 --> 06:31.024
but we can do better.

06:31.058 --> 06:31.859
(snaps fingers) I got it!

06:31.892 --> 06:32.593
"Jaywalkers"!

06:32.626 --> 06:34.695
Ugh, you disgust me!

06:34.728 --> 06:36.029
And I love it.

06:36.063 --> 06:36.964
It doesn't mean much to us

06:36.997 --> 06:39.099
now, but back then, "jay" was

06:39.132 --> 06:41.101
a really offensive slur.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.470
It basically meant "dirty

06:42.503 --> 06:44.371
hillbilly," which makes this

06:44.404 --> 06:45.873
really messed up.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.274
Like, what if today we called

06:47.307 --> 06:49.142
them "(bleep) walkers," or

06:49.176 --> 06:51.278
"(bleep) walkers," or even

06:51.311 --> 06:53.447
"(bleep) walkers"?

06:53.481 --> 06:53.947
Hey, man, come on, there's

06:53.981 --> 06:55.115
a kid on set.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.950
Yikes! Sorry.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.452
To publicize their new insult,

06:58.486 --> 06:59.820
the auto industry actually

06:59.853 --> 07:01.822
planted stories in newspapers

07:01.855 --> 07:02.923
blaming pedestrians for

07:02.956 --> 07:03.591
automobile deaths.

07:03.624 --> 07:04.124
(typewriter dings)

07:04.157 --> 07:05.626
(gasps)

07:05.659 --> 07:06.994
Extra! Extra!

07:07.027 --> 07:08.395
Lame-brained jaywalker flings

07:08.428 --> 07:08.962
himself before a noble

07:08.996 --> 07:10.063
automobile.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.265
My boy, a jay?

07:12.299 --> 07:13.801
Serves him right, I say.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.135
I hate those good-for-nothing

07:15.168 --> 07:16.470
jays. (spits, spittoon dings)

07:16.504 --> 07:17.771
So do we all, sir.

07:17.805 --> 07:18.506
(spits, spittoon dings)

07:18.539 --> 07:19.940
Me, too.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.008
I hope my stupid, jay son rots

07:21.041 --> 07:22.009
in hell.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.744
(spits, spittoon dings)

07:23.777 --> 07:26.279
Today, jaywalking is a crime,

07:26.313 --> 07:27.848
and, in fact, most of our modern

07:27.881 --> 07:29.416
traffic safety culture descends

07:29.449 --> 07:30.651
from this kind of blame-shifting

07:30.684 --> 07:32.252
propaganda.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.487
Think about it.

07:33.521 --> 07:35.689
A group of private businessmen

07:35.723 --> 07:37.491
coined an offensive slur to

07:37.525 --> 07:38.859
promote their product, and it

07:38.892 --> 07:40.594
worked so well that today, it's

07:40.628 --> 07:42.462
a legal term.

07:42.496 --> 07:43.831
That's like if the trash can

07:43.864 --> 07:44.865
industry convinced us all to

07:44.898 --> 07:45.833
call littering,

07:45.866 --> 07:49.336
"(bleep) dropping."

07:49.369 --> 07:50.337
Seriously, dude, do you even

07:50.370 --> 07:51.805
think before you speak?

07:51.839 --> 07:53.373
You know, funny, I don't.

07:53.406 --> 07:54.642
As a result of this campaign,

07:54.675 --> 07:55.843
the street went from being a

07:55.876 --> 07:57.444
public place where everyone

07:57.477 --> 07:59.279
was welcome, to a terrifying

07:59.312 --> 08:00.848
off-limits death trap.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.049
(cars speeding by)

08:02.082 --> 08:03.851
Stay back, Ethel.

08:03.884 --> 08:04.852
The streets belong to the

08:04.885 --> 08:06.954
machines now.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.121
(tires screeching)

08:08.155 --> 08:08.989
Thank you for granting us

08:09.022 --> 08:11.324
passage, metal majesty.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.330
Well, so what?

08:17.364 --> 08:19.199
We needed cars to get around.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.668
Actually, we already had a

08:20.701 --> 08:22.235
fast, efficient way to get

08:22.269 --> 08:24.672
around the city-- the streetcar.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.239
At the time, almost every major

08:26.273 --> 08:27.541
city had them, but the

08:27.575 --> 08:30.043
automobile killed them.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.579
A single streetcar can carry

08:31.612 --> 08:33.080
dozens of pedestrians.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.214
But put each of those passengers

08:34.247 --> 08:35.482
in their own car, and they take

08:35.515 --> 08:36.550
up 100 square feet each.

08:36.584 --> 08:38.051
(horns honking)

08:38.085 --> 08:39.352
And that means one thing--

08:39.386 --> 08:40.888
traffic.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.222
Once the roads were gridlocked,

08:42.255 --> 08:43.757
the old, reliable streetcar

08:43.791 --> 08:47.027
became too slow to be effective.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.729
And that was the death of public

08:48.762 --> 08:50.230
transportation in America.

08:50.263 --> 08:51.364
Whoa.

08:51.398 --> 08:52.566
Once cars were the only way

08:52.600 --> 08:53.767
to get from place to place,

08:53.801 --> 08:55.603
we rebuilt our entire cities

08:55.636 --> 08:56.737
around them.

08:56.770 --> 08:57.905
And that's when things really

08:57.938 --> 08:59.206
took a turn for the worse.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.841
We started bulldozing entire

09:00.874 --> 09:02.710
neighborhoods to build urban

09:02.743 --> 09:04.578
highways, and in some cities,

09:04.612 --> 09:06.346
parking lots now take up a

09:06.379 --> 09:07.781
quarter of all the available

09:07.815 --> 09:09.282
land.

09:09.316 --> 09:10.784
All this space used just to

09:10.818 --> 09:12.085
store cars while they're asleep.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.921
(tires screeching)

09:13.954 --> 09:15.723
Uh, this part of the show is

09:15.756 --> 09:17.024
really weird.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.191
Parking lots are deserts in

09:18.225 --> 09:19.259
the city.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.360
Who's this dude?

09:20.393 --> 09:21.895
This "dude" is Professor

09:21.929 --> 09:23.430
Donald Shoup, our foremost

09:23.463 --> 09:24.464
expert on the economics

09:24.497 --> 09:25.365
of parking.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.767
Oh, okay.

09:26.800 --> 09:27.801
Parking lots don't employ

09:27.835 --> 09:28.902
any people.

09:28.936 --> 09:30.203
They simply provide space

09:30.237 --> 09:31.371
for cars.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.773
We have expensive housing for

09:32.806 --> 09:34.041
people, and free parking

09:34.074 --> 09:35.142
for cars.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.644
We have our priorities the wrong

09:36.677 --> 09:37.645
way around.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.312
And the worst part is, many

09:39.346 --> 09:40.914
cities require far too much

09:40.948 --> 09:42.382
parking, and this blights their

09:42.415 --> 09:43.617
downtowns.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.753
We're killing our own cities.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.454
It's a huge bummer.

09:47.487 --> 09:48.889
It is an honor to animate

09:48.922 --> 09:50.724
you, sir. (chuckles)

09:50.758 --> 09:52.125
When we design society so that

09:52.159 --> 09:53.961
it's more comfortable for cars,

09:53.994 --> 09:55.095
we make it less habitable

09:55.128 --> 09:56.463
for humans.

09:56.496 --> 09:57.931
In a city designed around public

09:57.965 --> 09:59.299
transportation, this space would

09:59.332 --> 10:01.134
be full of homes and businesses,

10:01.168 --> 10:02.102
and you could walk from place

10:02.135 --> 10:03.303
to place.

10:03.336 --> 10:04.471
But in most of our cities and

10:04.504 --> 10:06.439
suburbs, everything is so spread

10:06.473 --> 10:08.141
apart that nothing is within

10:08.175 --> 10:09.977
walking distance, giving you no

10:10.010 --> 10:12.612
choice but to drive.

10:12.646 --> 10:13.480
And it didn't have to be

10:13.513 --> 10:14.682
this way.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.283
We could have built walkable

10:16.316 --> 10:17.484
cities based around public

10:17.517 --> 10:19.086
transportation like western

10:19.119 --> 10:20.954
Europe and Japan did.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.756
But we missed that chance, and

10:22.790 --> 10:24.491
now you have to have a car

10:24.524 --> 10:25.492
to get around.

10:25.525 --> 10:27.094
So, write him a check.

10:27.127 --> 10:27.761
Yeah! (laughing)

10:27.795 --> 10:28.361
(alarm blaring)

10:28.395 --> 10:30.931
Oh, yeah!

10:30.964 --> 10:37.204
Here it comes!

10:37.237 --> 10:38.271
Well, you know, son,

10:38.305 --> 10:39.339
I thought it was gonna be really

10:39.372 --> 10:40.674
cool buying you a new car and

10:40.708 --> 10:42.009
everything, but now I know that

10:42.042 --> 10:43.643
we've been tricked by a bunch of

10:43.677 --> 10:45.178
evil car guys, or whatever.

10:45.212 --> 10:46.279
Nah, you know what?

10:46.313 --> 10:47.380
Even knowing all that stuff,

10:47.414 --> 10:48.782
I still love this thing.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.450
Cars are still awesome.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.351
(both screaming)

10:51.384 --> 10:52.185
Actually, I haven't even

10:52.219 --> 10:53.120
begun to scratch the surface of

10:53.153 --> 10:53.987
why cars suck.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.359
Oh, what's up?

10:59.392 --> 11:00.193
Hey, hey!

11:00.227 --> 11:02.295
Hey! Ah!

11:02.329 --> 11:04.197
Dude, sweet ride!

11:04.231 --> 11:05.365
Paige is gonna freak when

11:05.398 --> 11:06.633
we roll up to her party

11:06.666 --> 11:07.500
in this dope--

11:07.534 --> 11:08.235
Death trap?

11:08.268 --> 11:09.703
Oh, no, uh, burden?

11:09.737 --> 11:11.371
How about "infrastructural

11:11.404 --> 11:12.973
tumor"? (chuckles)

11:13.006 --> 11:13.807
Who's the hair dude?

11:13.841 --> 11:14.674
Oh, greetings.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.810
I'm Adam Conover.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.145
Greetings, man, I'm Gavis.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.047
I'm Trunt. Greetings.

11:20.080 --> 11:20.547
Hey, is he riding with us

11:20.580 --> 11:21.381
tonight?

11:21.414 --> 11:22.750
No, no, no!

11:22.783 --> 11:25.318
I'd be delighted to.

11:25.352 --> 11:30.490
Oh, my God.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.559
Aw, man, late night, chillin'

11:32.592 --> 11:33.560
with the boys, right?

11:33.593 --> 11:35.428
Yeah!

11:35.462 --> 11:35.863
You know, I've never done this

11:35.896 --> 11:37.397
before.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.398
You'friends before?ut with

11:38.431 --> 11:39.566
No, but I have practiced with

11:39.599 --> 11:41.001
dolls at home, so, I think I can

11:41.034 --> 11:42.235
nail this.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.703
Man, just too be we gotta drive

11:43.737 --> 11:45.405
to the party, right? (scoffs)

11:45.438 --> 11:46.373
Okay, dude, you know what?

11:46.406 --> 11:47.074
It sounds like you just

11:47.107 --> 11:48.175
hate cars.

11:48.208 --> 11:48.575
You don't even have a driver's

11:48.608 --> 11:49.676
license.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.878
I told you, Zack, I have bad

11:50.911 --> 11:51.945
depth perception!

11:51.979 --> 11:53.781
And, yeah, I do just hate cars.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.115
And it is just my opinion.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.583
But my opinion is based on a lot

11:56.616 --> 11:58.251
of statistics, and logic, and

11:58.285 --> 11:59.686
personal experience.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.854
Oh, I hate them so much!

12:00.888 --> 12:04.391
(engine revving)

12:04.424 --> 12:05.759
Yo, can we pick up Stef--

12:05.793 --> 12:06.593
Cars are great for

12:06.626 --> 12:07.795
long-distance travel, but

12:07.828 --> 12:09.396
they're an objectively terrible

12:09.429 --> 12:10.764
way to get around a city.

12:10.798 --> 12:11.899
Hey, whatever.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.100
I love driving mine.

12:13.133 --> 12:13.867
Okay, well, do you love

12:13.901 --> 12:14.902
traffic?

12:14.935 --> 12:16.136
Because the average driver

12:16.169 --> 12:17.971
spends one work week a year

12:18.005 --> 12:19.439
stuck in traffic.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.408
Duh, we can fix that.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.409
You want less traffic, just

12:22.442 --> 12:23.777
build more roads.

12:23.811 --> 12:24.611
Oh, that would be great if

12:24.644 --> 12:25.779
it worked.

12:25.813 --> 12:27.114
But it's the roads that cause

12:27.147 --> 12:27.948
the traffic.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.883
(scoffs) Yeah, right!

12:29.917 --> 12:32.219
It's a concept called...

12:32.252 --> 12:33.620
Here, check out Gavis's sick

12:33.653 --> 12:34.955
cargo shorts.

12:34.988 --> 12:35.755
His pockets look pretty full,

12:35.789 --> 12:36.790
huh?

12:36.824 --> 12:37.124
Oh, yeah, it's my cross

12:37.157 --> 12:38.425
to bear.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.459
I don't know, maybe he just

12:39.492 --> 12:40.794
needs more pockets.

12:40.828 --> 12:41.661
Great idea!

12:41.694 --> 12:42.896
Let's test it.

12:42.930 --> 12:43.630
(snaps fingers, magic shimmers)

12:43.663 --> 12:46.466
Oh, green, sweet!

12:46.499 --> 12:48.802
Aw, man, it's already full.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.070
Sorry, dude.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.504
If I see an open space,

12:51.538 --> 12:53.573
I'm gonna fill it.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.241
What can I say?

12:54.274 --> 12:55.308
I'm only human.

12:55.342 --> 12:55.976
Thank you for the

12:56.009 --> 12:56.643
demonstration, Trunt.

12:56.676 --> 12:58.345
Trunt!

12:58.378 --> 12:59.579
Historically, every time

12:59.612 --> 13:00.480
we've built more roads...

13:00.513 --> 13:01.648
(horns honking)

13:01.681 --> 13:03.483
(bulldozers razing)

13:03.516 --> 13:04.351
The amount of traffic has gone

13:04.384 --> 13:06.119
up by an identical amount.

13:06.153 --> 13:06.920
We can't build our way out of

13:06.954 --> 13:08.188
the traffic problem.

13:08.221 --> 13:10.958
Cars equal traffic, period.

13:10.991 --> 13:11.791
(popping)

13:11.825 --> 13:14.828
Nice!

13:14.862 --> 13:15.829
Plus, cars are inherently

13:15.863 --> 13:17.097
unsafe.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.332
Uh, no, only bad drivers get

13:19.366 --> 13:20.367
in car accidents.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.935
I'm fine because I'm a good

13:21.969 --> 13:23.003
driver.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.704
Yeah, you and everyone else.

13:24.737 --> 13:26.039
90% of drivers say they're

13:26.073 --> 13:27.007
better than average.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.275
That's impossible.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.609
Yep, plus, it's people who

13:29.642 --> 13:30.643
think that they're good drivers

13:30.677 --> 13:31.044
who are actually the worst

13:31.078 --> 13:31.945
drivers.

13:31.979 --> 13:32.679
Whoa, really?

13:32.712 --> 13:34.381
Shut up, Trunt!

13:34.414 --> 13:35.482
'Cause most accidents are

13:35.515 --> 13:36.449
caused by inattention, and you

13:36.483 --> 13:37.350
pay the least amount of

13:37.384 --> 13:38.185
attention to the road when

13:38.218 --> 13:39.186
you're confident.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.353
Which is also why most accidents

13:40.387 --> 13:41.989
are caused on clear, sunny roads

13:42.022 --> 13:42.522
and to sober drivers.

13:42.555 --> 13:43.656
Yeah.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.692
I love that you know stuff!

13:45.725 --> 13:46.359
Yeah, well, I get that

13:46.393 --> 13:47.460
a lot, too.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.795
Okay, well, this car is

13:48.828 --> 13:50.030
super safe.

13:50.063 --> 13:50.563
It's like I'm driving a

13:50.597 --> 13:51.398
spaceship.

13:51.431 --> 13:51.965
I have this super smart

13:51.999 --> 13:52.900
computer--

13:52.933 --> 13:53.700
That mostly controls the

13:53.733 --> 13:54.701
air conditioning.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.203
The car itself is still

13:56.236 --> 13:57.704
controlled by a human, an

13:57.737 --> 13:59.506
unreliable and easily distracted

13:59.539 --> 14:00.673
system that--

14:00.707 --> 14:02.709
Aah! Oh, crap, oh, crap!

14:02.742 --> 14:03.710
Guys, it's okay.

14:03.743 --> 14:04.912
It's just me. (chuckles)

14:04.945 --> 14:06.013
What the hell?

14:06.046 --> 14:08.015
Ooh, TV magic, ahh.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.250
But, he-- you-- you jumped

14:10.283 --> 14:11.584
in front of my car.

14:11.618 --> 14:12.319
Actually, you missed

14:12.352 --> 14:13.353
the sign.

14:13.386 --> 14:14.554
This area is a host crossing.

14:14.587 --> 14:15.755
And maybe you missed it because

14:15.788 --> 14:17.657
your car is too safe.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.026
Studies have shown that modern

14:19.059 --> 14:20.693
cars and roads that make us feel

14:20.727 --> 14:22.829
secure cause us to unconsciously

14:22.862 --> 14:24.064
compensate and drive more

14:24.097 --> 14:25.365
dangerously.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.167
And it's a big part of why tens

14:27.200 --> 14:28.835
of thousands of Americans die

14:28.868 --> 14:30.170
on the road every year.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.204
Hey, Zack, this guy's making

14:31.238 --> 14:37.510
me feel sad.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.879
Ah, what a majestic creature.

14:39.913 --> 14:46.086
(slurping)

14:46.119 --> 14:47.254
Okay, but when I'm in this

14:47.287 --> 14:49.456
baby, I'm free.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.758
It's just me and the open road.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.560
Yeah, you're free all right.

14:53.593 --> 14:54.594
As long as you keep paying for

14:54.627 --> 14:56.796
insurance, fuel, registration,

14:56.829 --> 14:58.231
and repairs.

14:58.265 --> 14:59.232
So, I hope you have a job while

14:59.266 --> 15:00.767
you're on the open road.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.136
The average car costs $9,000

15:03.170 --> 15:05.272
a year just to own.

15:05.305 --> 15:06.739
Now, maybe you can afford that,

15:06.773 --> 15:08.275
but a lot of people can't.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.476
The average American family

15:09.509 --> 15:10.643
spends 20% of their income on

15:10.677 --> 15:12.112
transportation.

15:12.145 --> 15:12.545
That's more than they spend

15:12.579 --> 15:13.947
on food.

15:13.981 --> 15:14.881
And for the poorest Americans,

15:14.914 --> 15:16.649
it's 32%.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.318
Car ownership is a tremendous

15:18.351 --> 15:19.886
burden on the working poor.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.121
Oh, hey!

15:21.154 --> 15:22.089
There's my friend, Tim Peters!

15:22.122 --> 15:22.822
Yeah, pull over, pull over!

15:22.855 --> 15:23.991
(tires screeching)

15:24.024 --> 15:24.958
Hey, Tim.

15:24.992 --> 15:26.226
Hey, Adam, sweet ride.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.460
Aw, thanks.

15:27.494 --> 15:28.495
I'm just, lmy bros.lling with

15:28.528 --> 15:30.130
Guys, this is Tim Peters.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.131
He is the executive director of

15:31.164 --> 15:32.165
Door of Hope.

15:32.199 --> 15:32.899
Would you tell them a little bit

15:32.932 --> 15:33.766
about what you guys do?

15:33.800 --> 15:34.968
Yeah! Hey, guys.

15:35.002 --> 15:36.136
We help homeless families go

15:36.169 --> 15:37.104
from homelessness, to

15:37.137 --> 15:38.338
self-sufficiency, to permanent

15:38.371 --> 15:39.406
housing, and everything

15:39.439 --> 15:41.308
in between.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.475
what your experience with, you

15:42.509 --> 15:43.676
know, automobiles has been?

15:43.710 --> 15:44.811
Yeah, transportation is a big

15:44.844 --> 15:45.979
issue with our families.

15:46.013 --> 15:47.180
Car ownership can actually send

15:47.214 --> 15:48.581
them backwards.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.417
So, how does a car make you

15:50.450 --> 15:51.951
go backwards?

15:51.985 --> 15:53.453
We had one client that was

15:53.486 --> 15:55.788
paying over 80% of her income

15:55.822 --> 15:56.990
on a car.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.358
She thought it was more

15:58.391 --> 15:59.792
important to have a car than

15:59.826 --> 16:01.428
even a home, because if she

16:01.461 --> 16:02.595
ended up homeless, at least she

16:02.629 --> 16:03.696
had a car to sleep in.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.165
And that had been her experience

16:05.198 --> 16:06.533
before coming to Door of Hope.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.168
Families need a car just to get

16:08.201 --> 16:09.202
to work, or to be able to get

16:09.236 --> 16:10.470
around in the city.

16:10.503 --> 16:11.804
But, sometimes, to make a car

16:11.838 --> 16:13.673
payment, they'll sacrifice their

16:13.706 --> 16:15.675
rent payment, or food, or even

16:15.708 --> 16:16.676
the basic essentials for

16:16.709 --> 16:17.610
their children.

16:17.644 --> 16:18.878
Wow, thank you for talking to

16:18.911 --> 16:20.013
us about this, Tim.

16:20.047 --> 16:20.480
Uh, hey, do you need a ride or

16:20.513 --> 16:21.448
anything?

16:21.481 --> 16:22.515
I think you're full already.

16:22.549 --> 16:23.050
I'll ride the bus.

16:23.083 --> 16:23.850
I'm okay.

16:23.883 --> 16:26.619
(engine revving)

16:26.653 --> 16:28.155
That's awful.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.023
Yeah, it is.

16:30.057 --> 16:31.691
Transportation is a fundamental

16:31.724 --> 16:33.126
human need.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.461
So, the fact that we built our

16:34.494 --> 16:36.463
entire country so that everyone

16:36.496 --> 16:38.065
in it has to buy and maintain

16:38.098 --> 16:39.566
one of these things just to move

16:39.599 --> 16:41.301
around their own community?

16:41.334 --> 16:43.036
That's a genuine tragedy.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.537
They're monstrously expensive,

16:44.571 --> 16:45.372
you have to deal with a

16:45.405 --> 16:46.706
psychologically manipulative

16:46.739 --> 16:48.575
charlatan just to buy one, and

16:48.608 --> 16:49.976
we are so bad at driving them

16:50.009 --> 16:51.044
that there's an entirely

16:51.078 --> 16:52.679
different predatory industry

16:52.712 --> 16:53.580
based around the fact that we

16:53.613 --> 16:54.747
constantly crash these things

16:54.781 --> 16:56.049
and die.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.650
Uh, you-- you're talking

16:57.684 --> 16:59.219
about the insurance industry,

16:59.252 --> 17:00.220
right?

17:00.253 --> 17:01.521
Yes, very good, Trunt.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.156
What really kills me about all

17:03.190 --> 17:04.924
of this is the only reason we're

17:04.957 --> 17:06.559
stuck with this clusterfudge is

17:06.593 --> 17:07.727
because we were tricked into

17:07.760 --> 17:09.028
building roads instead of

17:09.062 --> 17:11.364
subways 100 years ago!

17:11.398 --> 17:13.100
The dominance of the car is a

17:13.133 --> 17:14.434
massive cultural mistake.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.735
(door closes)

17:15.768 --> 17:18.171
(distant dog barking)

17:18.205 --> 17:19.372
But, I was gonna tell you how

17:19.406 --> 17:20.673
we can fix everything!

17:20.707 --> 17:24.744
Bros!

17:24.777 --> 17:26.946
(distant dog barking)

17:26.979 --> 17:30.883
(dialing phone)

17:30.917 --> 17:32.585
Hey, Mom.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.854
Can you come pick me up?

17:34.887 --> 17:38.591
It happened again.

17:38.625 --> 17:39.626
(tires screeching)

17:39.659 --> 17:41.094
(door opens)

17:41.128 --> 17:43.096
Get in.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.697
Trunt's curious.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.733
(whistling)

17:46.766 --> 17:48.435
I'll call you back.

17:48.468 --> 17:49.136
(whistling)

17:51.604 --> 17:56.809
♪♪

18:05.084 --> 18:07.554
Whoa, what is that?

18:07.587 --> 18:08.821
That, Trunt, is a subway

18:08.855 --> 18:09.989
station.

18:10.022 --> 18:12.225
In Los Angeles?

18:12.259 --> 18:13.793
No way!

18:13.826 --> 18:14.327
Yep! And there are more on

18:14.361 --> 18:16.396
the way.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.230
Hi, guys!

18:17.264 --> 18:18.331
I'm Seleta Reynolds.

18:18.365 --> 18:19.566
I'm in charge of the Los Angeles

18:19.599 --> 18:20.833
Department of Transportation.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.902
This is so weird.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.671
We've been up, like, all night.

18:24.704 --> 18:25.972
People say nobody walks in

18:26.005 --> 18:26.906
L.A., but nothing could be

18:26.939 --> 18:28.475
further from the truth.

18:28.508 --> 18:29.476
We have one of the busiest rail

18:29.509 --> 18:30.510
lines in the country, one of the

18:30.543 --> 18:31.744
busiest bus lines in the

18:31.778 --> 18:33.112
country, and more people walking

18:33.146 --> 18:34.681
and biking every day.

18:34.714 --> 18:35.815
We figured out that we have to

18:35.848 --> 18:36.783
plan for people and not

18:36.816 --> 18:38.351
just cars.

18:38.385 --> 18:39.752
(crunching)

18:39.786 --> 18:40.987
Is this a mirage?

18:41.020 --> 18:43.089
No, it's a public plaza.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.024
This used to be a road, but the

18:45.057 --> 18:46.426
community leaders got together

18:46.459 --> 18:47.360
and decided that they wanted

18:47.394 --> 18:49.095
a place to gather, and created

18:49.128 --> 18:50.763
a true public space.

18:50.797 --> 18:51.798
It turns out, when you make

18:51.831 --> 18:53.600
a great place to walk, it's

18:53.633 --> 18:54.467
really good for local

18:54.501 --> 18:55.602
businesses.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.304
Yo, that's counterintuitive

18:57.337 --> 18:59.206
as hell.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.107
But, I like it.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.309
So, sometimes, even though

19:02.342 --> 19:03.810
it's controversial, we have to

19:03.843 --> 19:05.778
take space for streets and give

19:05.812 --> 19:07.680
it to people so that everybody

19:07.714 --> 19:08.715
has a great choice for how they

19:08.748 --> 19:09.949
get around.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.150
And, look, no city has been

19:11.184 --> 19:12.219
shaped by the car more than

19:12.252 --> 19:13.553
L.A., so if they can make

19:13.586 --> 19:15.322
positive changes here, we can

19:15.355 --> 19:17.390
make them anywhere in America.

19:17.424 --> 19:19.626
Okay, but cars are still just

19:19.659 --> 19:20.660
fun to drive.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.028
I know they are, Zack.

19:22.061 --> 19:22.862
And they're a great option for

19:22.895 --> 19:23.830
certain kinds of travel.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.131
But, maybe we should be thinking

19:25.164 --> 19:26.199
about cars more like

19:26.233 --> 19:29.402
roller blades.

19:29.436 --> 19:30.337
They're a lot of fun when you're

19:30.370 --> 19:32.305
the only person using them.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.340
But, it would really suck if

19:33.373 --> 19:34.674
that was the only way people

19:34.707 --> 19:37.143
could get to work.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.978
So, you're saying I can keep

19:39.011 --> 19:41.481
my car, but I should use public

19:41.514 --> 19:43.082
transportation and support

19:43.115 --> 19:44.984
walkability initiatives.

19:45.017 --> 19:45.752
Exactly.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.254
Cool.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.187
Can I go?

19:48.221 --> 19:49.422
Sure you can, buddy.

19:49.456 --> 19:53.993
Put 'er there, dude!

19:54.026 --> 19:55.595
Put 'er there, Seleta!

19:55.628 --> 19:56.896
I gotta get back to work.

19:56.929 --> 20:01.000
Bye, Adam.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.336
Put 'er there, Adam.

20:03.370 --> 20:12.279
(whistling)

20:12.312 --> 20:13.546
Please.

20:20.587 --> 20:21.854
You know, I have to ask-- are

20:21.888 --> 20:23.456
you having a natural or

20:23.490 --> 20:25.892
a cesarean birth?

20:25.925 --> 20:26.859
Because, there are interesting

20:26.893 --> 20:28.261
downsides, in both cases.

20:28.295 --> 20:29.228
(chuckles)

20:29.262 --> 20:31.063
Hmm.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.131
Guess some people just don't

20:32.164 --> 20:33.600
want to learn.

20:33.633 --> 20:34.434
Hmm.

20:34.467 --> 20:35.302
Next time, on

20:35.335 --> 20:37.069
"Adam Ruins Everything..."

20:37.103 --> 20:38.471
Cop shows present forensic

20:38.505 --> 20:40.072
science as infallible, but in

20:40.106 --> 20:41.408
reality, a lot of it isn't

20:41.441 --> 20:43.109
scientific at all.

20:43.142 --> 20:43.610
No two fingerprints

20:43.643 --> 20:44.744
are alike.

20:44.777 --> 20:45.312
That's never been proven.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.613
Aah!

20:46.646 --> 20:48.247
The FBI gave flawed testimony

20:48.281 --> 20:50.383
in 90% of the cases they

20:50.417 --> 20:51.418
reviewed.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.085
The only backup we'll need today

20:53.119 --> 20:54.787
is from scholarly sources.
