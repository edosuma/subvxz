something's wrong?

I don't know.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.160
If there was, you'd think
they'd come to us.

Ma Tembo?
What's going on?

01:37.300 --> 01:38.460
Why are you running?

01:38.500 --> 01:40.130
Sorry, Kion!

01:40.170 --> 01:43.470
Don't mean to be rude,
but there's no time to talk!

01:43.500 --> 01:47.270
Whoa! That was
one big elephant
in one big hurry.

01:47.310 --> 01:49.240
Ono? See if
you can see why.

01:49.280 --> 01:50.440
On it!

01:50.480 --> 01:53.080
Is something
chasing them?
Negative!

01:53.110 --> 01:55.310
But they're not
the only ones running!

01:55.350 --> 01:57.420
Well, if they're not
running from something...

01:57.450 --> 02:00.020
They must be
running to something!

02:00.050 --> 02:01.190
Let's find out what!

02:01.220 --> 02:03.090
Come on!

02:03.120 --> 02:04.420

I'd miss it!

02:04.460 --> 02:05.990
Me, too!

I was in a panic,
let me tell you!

I don't get it.

02:09.300 --> 02:11.000

02:11.030 --> 02:12.330
It's just a tree.

02:12.370 --> 02:16.030
Maybe it's time
for the sausage fruit
to fall!

02:16.070 --> 02:18.300

these things? (SMOOCHES)

pretty impressive.

03:07.450 --> 03:09.020
Hmmm, maybe.

These guys are great!

06:15.440 --> 06:16.970
I know!

Mmm, they're okay
for baboons, I guess.

06:19.110 --> 06:21.250
You kidding?
They're so funny!

06:21.280 --> 06:23.080
Yes, they're hysterical.

Ha, ha.

At least you got to be
a part of the act, Ono.

a honey badger for their act.

I'm gonna go talk to 'em!

06:35.060 --> 06:37.130
Since they're visitors
in the Pride Lands,

06:37.160 --> 06:39.060
I think it's my duty
to say hello.

06:39.100 --> 06:40.130
Don't you?

06:40.170 --> 06:42.470
<i> Poa!</i> Good idea, Kion!

06:42.500 --> 06:45.040
(SIGHS) If you say so.

06:45.470 --> 06:48.340
That was un-Bunga-lievable!

Glad you enjoyed
that show!

06:50.280 --> 06:51.480
Enjoyed it?

06:51.510 --> 06:54.480
I'll never look
at sausage fruit
the same way again!

06:54.510 --> 06:58.420
You know, I know
a honey badger who would
be perfect for your act.

06:58.450 --> 07:01.250
(CHUCKLES) I'm sorry,
but we don't have
any openings right now.

07:01.290 --> 07:02.950
Oh, well.
Your loss.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.260
Welcome to the Pride Lands.

07:04.290 --> 07:07.090
I'm Kion.
I really enjoyed the show.

07:07.130 --> 07:08.190
You should come to Pride Rock

07:08.230 --> 07:10.090
and perform
for my mom and dad!

07:10.130 --> 07:12.030
The royal family!

07:12.070 --> 07:13.160
Yeah, that's right.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.230
I know 'em.
No biggie.

07:15.270 --> 07:17.170
Oh, you're, you're
the son of the king?

07:17.200 --> 07:18.400
He sure is!

07:18.440 --> 07:21.040
And he's the leader
of the Lion Guard!

07:21.070 --> 07:22.170
That's us.

07:22.210 --> 07:23.340
Uhh, really? (CHUCKLES)

07:23.380 --> 07:25.180
It's interesting, uh...

07:25.210 --> 07:26.440
Now if you'll excuse us,
we need to rest up
for this next show.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.150
Yeah, sure.

07:29.180 --> 07:32.080
We have to finish
our patrol, anyway.
See you!

07:32.120 --> 07:34.090
Yeah! (CHUCKLES)
Bye-bye! See you!

07:34.120 --> 07:36.050
Come on, everybody.
Let's go.

07:36.090 --> 07:37.390
Finally!

07:37.420 --> 07:40.990
I still think
"Bunga and the Baboons"
has a good ring to it.

07:41.030 --> 07:44.000
Anybody know
how he made those other
two baboons disappear?

07:44.030 --> 07:46.030
Nope. It was
pretty amazing.

07:46.070 --> 07:47.200
MA TEMBO: Lion Guard!

07:47.230 --> 07:48.300
Help!

07:48.330 --> 07:51.000
Sounds like Ma Tembo!
Come on!

07:51.040 --> 07:52.300
Till the Pride Lands end...

07:52.340 --> 07:54.240
ALL: Lion Guard Defend!

07:57.140 --> 07:59.140
What is it, Ma Tembo?
What's wrong?

07:59.180 --> 08:02.350
Just this morning
that tree had plenty
of flowers and leaves!

08:02.380 --> 08:05.080
Yeah! And there
was lots of grass!

08:05.120 --> 08:06.220
All around!

08:06.250 --> 08:08.050
Now it's all gone.

08:08.090 --> 08:09.220
Excuse me!

08:09.260 --> 08:12.420
I believe I was about to say
something very important!

08:12.460 --> 08:13.960
Sorry.

08:13.990 --> 08:16.230
There was scads
and scads of grass!

08:16.260 --> 08:17.360
Everywhere!

08:17.400 --> 08:19.400
And now it's all gone!

08:21.030 --> 08:23.200
Whoa! So are all the bugs!

08:23.240 --> 08:25.340
Someone came and took it all!

08:25.370 --> 08:27.240
You know what that means?

08:27.270 --> 08:28.370
What?

08:28.410 --> 08:30.440
I don't know.
I'm asking you!

08:30.480 --> 08:34.409
It means there's a food thief
in the Pride Lands!

08:34.450 --> 08:36.280
<i> Heyvi kabisa.</i>

08:36.320 --> 08:38.120
Eh, what's the big deal?

08:38.150 --> 08:39.419
There's plenty of food
to go around!

08:39.450 --> 08:42.020
It's almost
the dry season, Bunga.

08:42.059 --> 08:43.350
A lot of animals
have to eat extra now

08:43.390 --> 08:45.460
to survive when
less stuff is growing.

08:45.490 --> 08:47.190
Like my dad always says,

08:47.230 --> 08:48.260
"It's not fair to take

08:48.290 --> 08:49.990
"more than your share!"

08:50.030 --> 08:52.200
It's more than
not fair, Beshte!

08:52.230 --> 08:54.300
It goes against
the Circle of Life.

08:54.330 --> 08:56.030
Don't worry, Ma Tembo.

08:56.070 --> 08:58.170
The Lion Guard will
figure out who did this

08:58.200 --> 09:00.070
and make sure
it doesn't happen again!

09:00.410 --> 09:02.140
Thank you, Kion.

09:02.180 --> 09:06.140
Come, everyone.
Let's find
another place to eat.

09:06.180 --> 09:09.280
Ono, fly up and get
a closer look
at that acacia tree!

09:09.320 --> 09:10.280
Affirmative!

09:11.420 --> 09:14.050
Even the highest flowers
and leaves are gone!

09:16.120 --> 09:18.060
It must've been
somebody really tall!

09:18.090 --> 09:20.090
A giraffe!
I knew it!

09:20.130 --> 09:23.430
But the food thief
flipped over that rock
to get at the bugs.

09:23.460 --> 09:25.030
Could a giraffe do that?

09:25.400 --> 09:27.030
I doubt it.

09:27.070 --> 09:29.430
An elephant could, maybe.
With his trunk.

09:29.470 --> 09:32.100
An elephant!
I knew it!

09:32.140 --> 09:36.240
Well, an elephant could use
his trunk to grab flowers
and leaves from the tree.

09:36.280 --> 09:38.180
But elephants don't eat bugs.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.310
BESHTE: Check this out, guys!

09:40.350 --> 09:43.350
Somebody ate this grass
clear down to the ground!

09:43.380 --> 09:45.420
A zebra!
I knew it!

09:45.450 --> 09:47.420
I beg your pardon!

09:47.450 --> 09:51.290
Bunga, a zebra couldn't reach
the high leaves and flowers.

09:51.320 --> 09:55.160
Plus, some zebras
are afraid of...
(EXCLAIMS) Panic and run!

I found them!

19:27.230 --> 19:29.070
Thanks, Ono!
Lead the way!

19:31.200 --> 19:32.200
(BOTH CHATTERING)

19:36.380 --> 19:38.380
Stop doin' that!

19:38.410 --> 19:40.340
I don't know if you noticed,
but there's two more of 'em!

19:59.200 --> 20:00.460
(GROANS) Hold still!

20:00.500 --> 20:03.170
Whoa! Janja!

20:03.200 --> 20:05.240
I'm gettin' dizzy!

20:05.270 --> 20:06.340
Me, too!

20:08.410 --> 20:10.140
Ugh. Fur-brains!

20:11.110 --> 20:12.140
Guys, this way!

20:17.180 --> 20:19.420
Thanks for makin'
this so easy!

20:19.450 --> 20:22.390
(CHUCKLES) Check it out, boys!

20:22.420 --> 20:25.260
A baboon buffet!
(BOTH WHIMPERING)

20:25.290 --> 20:27.220
KION: Stop right there, Janja!

20:27.260 --> 20:28.330
Kion?

20:28.360 --> 20:31.060
KION: Step away
from the baboons!

20:31.100 --> 20:32.300
Hey, hey, they started it!

20:32.330 --> 20:34.160
I caught 'em stealing from me!

20:34.200 --> 20:36.370
And for that
they deserve to get eaten?

20:36.400 --> 20:38.100
Makes sense to me.

20:38.140 --> 20:41.040
Lion Guard.
Time to save
those baboons.

20:41.070 --> 20:42.110
Now!

20:49.110 --> 20:50.450
Had enough, Janja?

(BOTH CRYING)

20:52.320 --> 20:54.250
Fine. Then beat it!

20:54.290 --> 20:56.290
Yeah, we're goin'.
But you baboons

20:56.320 --> 20:58.190
stay out of my den!

20:58.220 --> 21:01.120
Hey, Janja,
you wanna hear a joke?

21:01.160 --> 21:03.390
A hyena takes a bath!

21:03.430 --> 21:05.400
(CHEEZI AND CHUNGU CHUCKLE)

21:08.070 --> 21:11.270
I can't believe you came
all this way to save us.

21:11.300 --> 21:13.270
Now we feel bad.

21:13.310 --> 21:15.110
What can we do
to pay you back?

21:16.180 --> 21:18.040
I've got an idea.

21:19.380 --> 21:21.040
Step right up, folks!

21:21.080 --> 21:22.250
Plenty of food
to go around!

21:22.280 --> 21:25.050
<i> Poa!</i> Great idea, Kion.

21:25.080 --> 21:26.150
Thanks, Beshte.

21:26.190 --> 21:27.480
Something for every taste!

21:27.520 --> 21:29.190
There's also entertainment!

21:29.220 --> 21:31.220
Just think of it
as dinner and a show!

21:31.260 --> 21:32.290
Thank you.

21:32.320 --> 21:34.020
Very gracious of you.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.330
See, Fuli?
These baboons
aren't so bad after all!

21:37.300 --> 21:39.130
Fuli?
(FULI GIGGLING)

21:39.160 --> 21:41.370
I think she agrees
with you, Bunga!

BESHTE: Go, Fuli!

21:43.500 --> 21:44.470
Whoo!

21:45.500 --> 21:47.100
What about you, Ono?

21:47.140 --> 21:49.040
Changed your mind
about the baboons?

21:49.070 --> 21:50.210
UROHO: Ono, heads up!
Huh?

21:51.280 --> 21:53.310
(GULPS)
I suppose they're okay.
