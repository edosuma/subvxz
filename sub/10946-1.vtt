00:00.341 --> 00:01.505
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.506 --> 00:03.548
We'll be putting an
offer on the ranch tomorrow.

00:03.568 --> 00:05.564
I just have to talk to my fiancee first.

00:05.584 --> 00:08.178
You look so beautiful.

00:10.021 --> 00:11.971
I knew it!

00:11.991 --> 00:14.049
- Ahmed offered me a job.
- Yeah, I know.

00:14.069 --> 00:16.767
No. Like on his actual team,

00:16.787 --> 00:19.022
travelling Europe for the
World Equestrian Games.

00:19.056 --> 00:21.057
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

00:21.091 --> 00:23.126
Jack, you may kiss the bride.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.362
We'll talk every day.

00:25.665 --> 00:27.297
Absolutely.

00:27.331 --> 00:29.432
I'll be back before you know it.

Wow. Thank you.

01:21.549 --> 01:22.930
Hi.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.733
Hi, it's nice to see you guys.

01:37.848 --> 01:40.780
Amy. There you are.

01:43.976 --> 01:45.505
It was one of those moments where...

01:45.540 --> 01:48.442
This... this is too tough to make.
This is...

01:48.462 --> 01:50.040
Why me?!

01:50.060 --> 01:52.138
I used to think that.

Keep up the pace, Georgie.

02:50.636 --> 02:53.252
I wanna check out some of these
horses before the auction.

02:53.665 --> 02:55.459
I found the clip!

02:55.479 --> 02:58.209
Look! Okay, watch.

02:58.229 --> 03:01.345
They were up against this
really amazing team from Brazil,

03:01.379 --> 03:03.815
and the last jump on the
course was a high oxer.

03:03.849 --> 03:05.837
The Brazilian horse
completely refused to jump

03:05.857 --> 03:07.193
and the rider flew right off.

03:07.213 --> 03:08.519
Ooh, that must have hurt.

03:08.553 --> 03:11.088
Yeah, and Amy's team was up next,

03:11.123 --> 03:14.391
and Ahmed totally aced that jump!
It was perfect!

03:14.426 --> 03:17.865
So they won and the crowd went crazy.
It was amazing.

03:17.885 --> 03:19.363
How do you know all this stuff?

03:19.397 --> 03:21.732
Well,
she's following these weird blogs.

03:21.766 --> 03:23.567
They're not weird.
There are a ton of them.

03:23.601 --> 03:26.095
Horse crazy people that follow the games

03:26.115 --> 03:28.672
and blog about them.
There's pictures, videos...

03:28.707 --> 03:31.090
She obsessed.
She's basically stalking Amy.

03:31.110 --> 03:33.391
I'm not stalking her.

03:33.411 --> 03:35.011
Yeah, you are!

03:35.046 --> 03:38.075
Hey! I bet I know more
about what she's doing than you do.

03:38.095 --> 03:40.030
Well, I bet you do too.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.253
Caleb!

03:43.287 --> 03:45.979
This is the gelding I
was telling you about.

03:45.999 --> 03:48.058
Three years old. Great breeding.

03:48.092 --> 03:49.935
Good for tie down/team roping, you name it.

03:49.955 --> 03:51.377
Cow bred on his dam's side.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.053
Huge potential. If you trained him,

03:53.073 --> 03:54.897
he'd be worth three times
what we could get him for.

03:54.931 --> 03:57.967
Okay. So including this guy,
we have six prospects.

03:58.001 --> 03:59.369
- You agree?
- Absolutely.

03:59.403 --> 04:02.213
- Hey, Caleb!
- Hollis.

04:02.233 --> 04:04.396
Hey, I hear business is
going real good for you guys.

04:04.416 --> 04:05.854
We certainly can't complain.

04:05.874 --> 04:07.209
We had a good start up.

04:07.244 --> 04:09.111
Yeah, I should've listened
to you before I sold you charger.

04:09.145 --> 04:11.143
I'd be a hundred thousand dollars richer.

04:11.163 --> 04:12.871
Taught me a real lesson though.

04:12.891 --> 04:14.650
- You've got a good eye.
- Thanks.

04:14.670 --> 04:18.249
You think? If you ask me,

04:18.269 --> 04:20.255
Caleb just gets lucky once in a while.

04:20.290 --> 04:22.424
I think what you guys really need is...

04:22.458 --> 04:24.559
somebody with a real eye
and some good connections.

04:24.594 --> 04:28.073
You know what? Uh, thanks for the interest
in partnering with us, Tim,

04:28.093 --> 04:30.415
but I'm gonna have to go
with my gut on this one.

04:30.435 --> 04:31.332
Darn right.

04:31.367 --> 04:33.134
Look, you guys buy some
horses and train 'em well,

04:33.168 --> 04:34.669
I'll take the whole lot off your hands.

04:34.704 --> 04:36.263
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Stay in touch.

04:36.283 --> 04:37.830
- All right.
- See ya.

04:37.850 --> 04:39.574
Wait a second, buddy. It's Hollis?

04:39.609 --> 04:42.068
- Yeah.
- Yeah, here. Take that.

04:42.471 --> 04:43.577
"Hot shots"?

04:43.597 --> 04:46.442
Yeah. Give me a call.
I'll talk to you about it.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.024
Will do.

04:50.149 --> 04:51.452
What?

04:52.106 --> 04:54.989
Oh. I didn't tell you guys.

04:55.658 --> 04:57.758
I started my own stock company.

04:57.793 --> 05:01.874
You know, I figured I had to put this
talent and experience to use somehow.

05:01.894 --> 05:05.750
Trust me, I would've been a lot better
partner than a competitor, but...

05:06.200 --> 05:08.155
What can you do?

05:08.558 --> 05:10.978
Get to work, I guess.

05:16.236 --> 05:19.343
Boy! Look who's back!

05:19.622 --> 05:22.482
Oh, I missed you so much!

05:22.516 --> 05:25.372
Not half as much as I missed you!

05:27.238 --> 05:30.356
- So Florida was good?
- Ocala was super.

05:30.390 --> 05:33.680
Uh, I met interesting people,
made some really super deals,

05:33.700 --> 05:36.563
but the best part of the entire trip:

05:36.942 --> 05:40.867
Wearing those 24-7. I really liked that.

05:40.901 --> 05:43.623
You said you didn't want to
tell anybody until Amy got back.

05:43.643 --> 05:46.138
Now she's coming home, right,
so we're going to tell them, right?

05:46.173 --> 05:48.884
So I was thinking maybe the best time
to announce it to the whole family

05:48.904 --> 05:52.018
would be at the homecoming dinner,
when everybody's there. What do you think?

05:52.038 --> 05:53.786
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah.

05:53.806 --> 05:57.583
But until we do,
I'm in Heartland territory...

05:57.827 --> 06:01.829
I'll take them off and hide them...
in my pocket.

06:08.965 --> 06:11.088
...nice 3-year-old gelding...

06:11.108 --> 06:13.646
Okay, we got the five we wanted.
Let's just focus on those.

06:13.666 --> 06:16.201
No.
You said it yourself, this guy's the best.

06:16.235 --> 06:18.985
- Look him move.
- He's beautiful.

06:19.005 --> 06:20.737
...Bid five thousand dollars.
Now fifty-five hundred.

06:20.757 --> 06:22.210
Uh, fifty-five, fifty-five.

06:22.230 --> 06:23.808
Mm, fifty-five. Six thousand dollars there.

06:23.842 --> 06:25.977
Give me sixty-five hundred.
The six is all...

06:26.012 --> 06:27.545
C'mon, man.
You gotta pull the trigger on him.

06:27.579 --> 06:28.679
Seven thousand dollars there.
Number seventy-five.

06:28.714 --> 06:30.315
Uh, seventy-five there, number minus six.

06:30.349 --> 06:31.983
There your number six,
there your number divide...

06:32.018 --> 06:34.377
Six thousand is all, must divide,
divide there and five...

06:34.397 --> 06:37.194
- Relax, man. Okay?
- Hey, we've already got Hollis as a buyer.

06:37.214 --> 06:39.123
I'm going for it.

06:39.157 --> 06:40.290
...That's seventy-five.
At seven thousand,

06:40.325 --> 06:41.458
almost thirty-five. A thousand a.

06:41.493 --> 06:42.459
Eight thousand and now we divide,

06:42.494 --> 06:43.794
divide there and back. Eighty-five.

06:43.829 --> 06:45.029
Uh, now we need some half.

06:45.063 --> 06:46.531
Now nine, five, now a nine a bid.

06:46.565 --> 06:48.265
Nine there, number nine there,
at least nine thousand

06:48.299 --> 06:49.266
and made ninety-five hundred now.

06:49.300 --> 06:50.635
So up a half there. Ninety-five,

06:50.669 --> 06:52.602
now it's up by five. Now it's up by half.

06:52.637 --> 06:56.427
And no. Sold him!
Ninety-five hundred dollars.

06:56.447 --> 06:59.984
- You got him!
- Yeah. Yeah, I guess I did.

07:03.206 --> 07:05.606
Lisa! Hey!

07:05.626 --> 07:07.064
- Hi!
- Welcome back.

07:07.084 --> 07:09.266
- Thank you.
- You're just in time for dinner.

07:09.286 --> 07:10.686
Perfect! How can I help?

07:10.721 --> 07:13.021
Oh no, I'm good. But, uh, I heard from Amy

07:13.056 --> 07:14.823
and her flight arrives tomorrow at two.

07:14.858 --> 07:16.459
Ooh! That's good news, isn't it

07:16.493 --> 07:18.594
It is indeed.

07:18.629 --> 07:19.928
Let me make a salad dressing,
that's what I can do.

07:19.963 --> 07:21.505
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah, look.

07:21.525 --> 07:23.499
I... oh.

07:23.533 --> 07:26.068
So... do you have cold pressed?
That's not cold pressed, right?

07:26.102 --> 07:27.502
You know what, Lisa?
I... I can make the salad dressing.

07:27.536 --> 07:28.603
- That's fine.
- All right. I'll uh...

07:28.638 --> 07:29.972
- I'll set the table.
- Sure!

07:30.006 --> 07:31.940
All right!

07:31.975 --> 07:34.109
Oh...

07:34.144 --> 07:35.778
Do you have nice place mats?

07:35.812 --> 07:37.179
Where are the ones that
i got you in provence?

07:37.213 --> 07:38.847
Um, in the dining room, in the cabinet.

07:38.882 --> 07:41.083
Great.

07:41.117 --> 07:43.024
I need to kiss my gorgeous god-daughter.
Where is she?

07:43.044 --> 07:44.218
Playing in her room.

07:44.253 --> 07:46.388
All alone, by herself, in the room?

07:46.422 --> 07:48.629
She likes playing in her room.

07:48.649 --> 07:52.193
Hmm... okay.

07:52.227 --> 07:55.530
Okay, grandpa, listen.
Can you do me a favour?

07:55.564 --> 07:57.131
You know I love Lisa, but...

07:57.166 --> 07:59.517
- keep her out of the kitchen, okay?
- What? Why?

07:59.537 --> 08:01.402
Because she's been here
less than two minutes

08:01.436 --> 08:03.037
and she's already... you know.

08:03.071 --> 08:04.772
No, I don't.

08:04.807 --> 08:06.781
She just sort of takes over.

08:06.801 --> 08:09.243
And listen,
I'm really glad you guys are back together,

08:09.278 --> 08:11.012
but... it's just in the past few months,

08:11.046 --> 08:13.971
she's been around here a lot.
Like... a lot.

08:13.991 --> 08:16.283
She's been in Florida for three weeks.

08:16.318 --> 08:18.385
I know.
And it's been kind of... relaxing.

08:18.420 --> 08:20.854
I'm sorry, but it has.

08:20.888 --> 08:22.823
I don't mean to sound harsh,

08:22.857 --> 08:24.124
but it's just that I was sort of hoping

08:24.158 --> 08:26.255
Amy was coming home to just us.

08:26.275 --> 08:27.861
You know, just family.

08:27.895 --> 08:30.779
Okay! What can I do now?

08:30.799 --> 08:33.111
Oh! Look at that! Lisa's back!

08:33.131 --> 08:35.764
Hi!

08:35.784 --> 08:38.038
- And Amy's coming home tomorrow.
- Yeah.

08:38.072 --> 08:41.041
This is gonna be one interesting homecoming

08:41.075 --> 08:43.576
with Amy's news and who
knows what else, huh?

08:43.610 --> 08:45.245
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

08:45.279 --> 08:47.786
Oh, let me help with that!

08:53.620 --> 08:55.521
Giddy up, Orky!

08:55.556 --> 08:58.263
Oh, I missed you!

08:58.635 --> 09:01.828
Hey,
I hope you know Caleb got robbed today

09:01.862 --> 09:02.928
with the price he paid for those horses.

09:02.963 --> 09:05.648
You're his business partner,
you should have kept him in line.

09:05.668 --> 09:07.867
Well, why worry about me when
you got your own thing going, right?

09:07.901 --> 09:09.134
Yes, I do. "Hot shots."

09:09.169 --> 09:10.936
Oh, here we go...

09:10.956 --> 09:14.039
"Hot shots"? Wha...? Georgie! Dinner!

09:14.074 --> 09:15.807
It's your dad's new company.

09:15.842 --> 09:17.509
Okay, why would you do that, dad?

09:17.543 --> 09:19.994
Go into competition with
your future son-in-law.

09:20.014 --> 09:22.481
There's nothing wrong with
a little healthy competition.

09:22.515 --> 09:25.684
We could've had it all...
the business, Caleb, and me.

09:25.718 --> 09:27.018
We've been over this before.

09:27.052 --> 09:29.700
Business and family don't really mix.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.923
I think they can be a great mix.
Just ask, Lou?

09:31.943 --> 09:33.759
No comment.

09:33.793 --> 09:35.159
Okay, it's time for dinner now.

09:35.194 --> 09:37.529
Let's... let's put your horse in the barn.

09:37.563 --> 09:42.104
Come on, sweetie.
Oh... you're getting so heavy.

09:43.175 --> 09:45.578
Ty, remember we were gonna go
surprise Amy at the airport tomorrow?

09:45.598 --> 09:48.206
- Yeah.
- Well, let's!

09:48.240 --> 09:49.507
I know she said she was
gonna make her own way home,

09:49.541 --> 09:51.347
but if we left early enough...

09:51.367 --> 09:53.722
I gotta head to the clinic first,
but I'll meet you there.

09:53.742 --> 09:55.033
Okay.

09:56.311 --> 09:58.532
Lou! Yeah, I'm on my way.

09:58.552 --> 10:00.984
Yeah, I'll meet you in the baggage area.
Bye.

10:07.504 --> 10:09.110
No. Come on!

10:40.851 --> 10:42.258
Thank you.

11:04.092 --> 11:07.689
Hello! I'm home!

11:08.930 --> 11:10.452
Hello?

11:14.502 --> 11:18.426
Okay, guys, you can come out now.
I know you're hiding.

11:20.975 --> 11:22.570
Hello?!

11:24.891 --> 11:28.246
Hi, Remy! How are you?

11:28.266 --> 11:30.805
How are you?

11:46.653 --> 11:48.117
Come on, girl.

12:05.201 --> 12:06.899
- Amy?!
- Lou!

12:06.919 --> 12:08.370
- There you are!
- Amy!

12:08.390 --> 12:11.011
- There she is!
- Hey!

12:11.045 --> 12:13.379
We went to the airport to pick you up!

12:13.414 --> 12:15.381
Oh, sweetheart,
I can't believe you're home!

12:15.416 --> 12:17.817
Well, I told you I was getting a ride home!

12:17.852 --> 12:18.885
Well, how did you get home?

12:18.920 --> 12:20.219
There was a car waiting for me.

12:20.254 --> 12:24.057
- Katie, hi!
- Mm. Hug me.

12:24.091 --> 12:26.559
Georgie! Look at... That's beautiful!

12:26.593 --> 12:29.028
She worked so hard on that.
Amy, you look amazing!

12:29.063 --> 12:31.197
Look at your hair and those boots,
are they from Paris?

12:31.231 --> 12:32.998
They are.

12:33.033 --> 12:34.900
Wait, where's Ty?
He didn't come to the airport?

12:34.935 --> 12:36.702
No, he didn't, but...

12:39.039 --> 12:40.971
He's here now.

12:45.439 --> 12:47.279
Ty, hey!

12:58.329 --> 12:59.591
Here you go.

12:59.625 --> 13:01.960
Whoa, Lou, not that much.
Like... like half that, please.

13:01.994 --> 13:03.528
But you love my mashed potatoes.

13:03.563 --> 13:05.063
I know. It's just...

13:05.098 --> 13:07.479
The servings weren't quite
so generous in Europe.

13:07.499 --> 13:09.334
That is true.

13:09.368 --> 13:11.603
I feel like I put on 10 pounds
just sitting down at this table.

13:11.637 --> 13:14.432
Well, no one is force feeding you.

13:14.452 --> 13:16.599
And I didn't say that.

13:17.943 --> 13:20.840
Wow, Amy, nice necklace.
Where did you get it?

13:20.860 --> 13:21.679
Thanks. It was a gift.

13:21.714 --> 13:23.748
A goodbye present from the team.

13:23.782 --> 13:25.149
Yeah, it's nice.

13:25.183 --> 13:28.152
Yeah. It's an expensive little gift.
Are those real diamonds?

13:28.186 --> 13:30.906
Um...

13:30.926 --> 13:33.591
What was it like?
Tell us everything!

13:33.611 --> 13:35.959
It was absolutely amazing.

13:35.994 --> 13:37.561
At first,
I was worried that I wouldn't fit in;

13:37.596 --> 13:39.230
that no one would listen
to my training ideas,

13:39.264 --> 13:42.099
but the team totally accepted me.

13:42.134 --> 13:46.258
It was just an incredible experience.
It was beyond what I imagined.

13:46.278 --> 13:48.847
Well, you deserve that kind of respect.
You've earned it.

13:48.867 --> 13:51.525
And we took side trips.
We went to Paris, Rome...

13:51.545 --> 13:54.379
Just the history, the culture, the beauty.

13:54.399 --> 13:56.179
It's so unbelievable.

13:56.213 --> 13:58.288
I was flying in today
and I remember thinking

13:58.308 --> 14:00.851
everything looked so bleak.
You know, the suburbs...

14:00.885 --> 14:03.052
But it was nice seeing the mountains.

14:03.086 --> 14:07.340
Anyway, all in all,
the tour was an incredible experience.

14:08.171 --> 14:11.100
Speaking of incredible experiences...

14:13.060 --> 14:14.393
Jack?

14:14.413 --> 14:16.398
Yeah... yup.

14:17.788 --> 14:20.295
Uh, Georgie sure has had

14:20.556 --> 14:23.505
some incredible experiences around here.

14:23.540 --> 14:25.782
You'd be surprised at the responsibility

14:25.802 --> 14:27.376
that she's taken on.

14:27.410 --> 14:30.046
Why, she stepped right into
your shoes while you were gone.

14:30.080 --> 14:31.647
Well, that's good to hear.

14:31.682 --> 14:34.199
She pretty much had to, you know.

14:34.219 --> 14:35.584
You left on such short notice,

14:35.618 --> 14:37.986
- everybody had to kinda pitch in.
- Dad...

14:38.020 --> 14:40.155
Well, we were kinda short handed,

14:40.190 --> 14:41.890
that's all I'm saying.
And honey, I understand.

14:41.924 --> 14:45.380
I mean, you shouldn't have missed
that opportunity for the world.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.362
But, you know, it's just...

14:47.397 --> 14:49.231
You were here and then... fshht!
Gone.

14:49.265 --> 14:52.932
It's not like I...
I abandoned you guys.

14:53.703 --> 14:55.170
Were there any celebrities on the trip?

14:55.204 --> 14:56.971
I heard the tour was crawling with them.

14:57.006 --> 14:59.007
You know,
I will tell you all about it

14:59.041 --> 15:01.398
once I've had a chance to decompress.

15:01.671 --> 15:03.678
But right now, I'm just...
I'm feeling the jet lag.

15:09.551 --> 15:12.674
So, um,
what was Lisa getting at out there?

15:12.694 --> 15:14.499
Um... getting at...?

15:14.519 --> 15:16.790
Yeah, she was about to say something.

15:16.825 --> 15:18.892
- Oh, no, I...
- Oh no, no, no.

15:18.912 --> 15:22.031
You did dinner, miss.
You go... take a break.

15:22.051 --> 15:23.582
Honestly, I'm good.

15:23.602 --> 15:24.665
Oh, go... just... just...

15:24.700 --> 15:26.366
go and spend some time with your sister.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.035
- Catch up.
- She's catching up with Ty.

15:28.069 --> 15:30.309
The last thing she needs is me butting in.

15:31.818 --> 15:33.139
Well, you could put Katie to bed.

15:33.159 --> 15:36.472
Oh! Okay. Fine.

15:40.314 --> 15:43.948
So... I gave you a lead in out there

15:43.968 --> 15:46.327
and you didn't take it. What's going on?

15:46.347 --> 15:48.622
Uh, nothing is going on.

15:48.656 --> 15:51.791
Really? 'Cause we're supposed
to tell everybody our news

15:51.825 --> 15:54.628
tonight, right?
If I didn't know any better,

15:54.662 --> 15:57.342
it seems like you just don't
really wanna tell them.

15:57.362 --> 15:59.409
That is not true.

15:59.429 --> 16:01.896
This was Amy's first night back

16:01.916 --> 16:04.092
and I just figured...

16:04.112 --> 16:07.754
Well, she should have her moment.
She did seem a little overwhelmed.

16:07.774 --> 16:12.291
Mm. Are you sure it's not you
that's a little overwhelmed?

16:15.515 --> 16:17.849
You know,
I'm kinda glad your truck broke down.

16:17.884 --> 16:21.107
Gives you an excuse to
stay overnight in the loft.

16:21.127 --> 16:23.316
Well, do I need an excuse?

16:23.336 --> 16:25.620
I guess not.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.606
Clearly we are out of practice.

16:33.144 --> 16:36.201
Well, that can be fixed.

16:36.855 --> 16:40.140
So, um, how have things been going here?

16:40.160 --> 16:41.973
What's new?

16:42.220 --> 16:44.242
Uh, it's been busy. Really busy.

16:44.277 --> 16:46.577
Um, we started that horse
prospecting with Caleb.

16:46.612 --> 16:49.014
- Yeah, you were saying...
- Well, you know that, yeah.

16:49.034 --> 16:51.248
So how's... how's that?

16:51.516 --> 16:53.754
Good,
except it didn't take long for your dad

16:53.774 --> 16:55.392
to go into direct competition with us.

16:55.412 --> 16:57.254
Are you kidding me? My dad?

16:57.274 --> 16:58.495
Would I kid about your dad?

16:58.515 --> 17:01.158
I...

17:01.718 --> 17:05.198
So... how's Scott and the clinic?

17:05.218 --> 17:07.396
It's good. It's hectic.

17:07.432 --> 17:10.761
Um... I'm fast tracking at
school so I can graduate sooner.

17:10.781 --> 17:13.007
- You're fast tracking?
- Mm-hmm.

17:13.027 --> 17:15.415
You... you just never mentioned that.

17:15.435 --> 17:18.815
Well, it was...
kind of hard to... stay in touch.

17:18.835 --> 17:20.909
Yeah, I know. I was all over the place.

17:20.929 --> 17:22.423
And the time difference, too, was...

17:22.443 --> 17:24.531
- Brutal.
- Yeah.

17:24.551 --> 17:28.337
So did you even have time to miss me?

17:28.846 --> 17:30.608
Of course I missed you.

17:41.259 --> 17:42.278
Look, first thing tomorrow,

17:42.298 --> 17:44.633
I gotta pick up some
parts for that damn truck.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.703
Yeah, I'll, um... I'd love to come.

17:48.155 --> 17:50.004
There's something I've been dying to see.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.329
What do you think?

18:00.349 --> 18:02.685
It's a bit smaller than I remember.

18:03.007 --> 18:04.538
You still like it though, right?

18:04.558 --> 18:06.531
Yes, I love it!

18:08.331 --> 18:10.025
Hey!

18:10.229 --> 18:13.076
What the heck do you think
you're doing on my land?

18:19.327 --> 18:20.152
Listen, I don't get it.

18:20.172 --> 18:21.873
You were supposed to phone me

18:21.907 --> 18:24.084
if there were any interested
buyers or pending offers,

18:24.104 --> 18:27.178
and instead,
you sold it right out from under us.

18:29.359 --> 18:31.249
No, I did not say I would
check in with you.

18:31.283 --> 18:33.584
You were supposed to keep me posted.

18:33.618 --> 18:37.087
I think you owe us a damn good explan...

18:40.428 --> 18:42.319
I don't believe this.

18:42.339 --> 18:43.794
Ty, it's nobody's fault.

18:43.829 --> 18:45.696
Yes it is, Amy. The agent was supposed...

18:45.731 --> 18:49.245
Ty, it's just a horrible misunderstanding.

18:53.675 --> 18:55.239
I'm so sorry.

18:55.793 --> 18:57.456
I'm not.

18:59.044 --> 19:01.898
Honey, I mean I think it's a good thing.

19:02.072 --> 19:03.780
The place was a dump.

19:03.814 --> 19:05.448
It was great that you had the down payment,

19:05.483 --> 19:08.485
but the cost to fix it up, make it livable,

19:08.519 --> 19:11.254
and the ongoing expenses, upkeep...

19:11.288 --> 19:13.790
Well, your dad has a point.
It needed a lot of work.

19:13.824 --> 19:15.892
You were getting in
a little over your head.

19:15.926 --> 19:18.294
Did any of you ever think
that this was a good idea?

19:18.328 --> 19:19.962
It was just a bit unrealistic.

19:19.997 --> 19:21.597
Unrealistic?! No, it wasn't!

19:21.631 --> 19:23.286
Why do you think I went to Europe?

19:23.306 --> 19:25.401
To make some money!

19:26.036 --> 19:27.236
Amy!

19:27.271 --> 19:30.917
There's a guy outside with a horse trailer
and he's asking for you.

19:36.046 --> 19:38.248
I'm confused.
I wasn't expecting a horse.

19:38.268 --> 19:39.782
Well, I had my orders.

19:39.816 --> 19:41.850
This is unbelievable!

19:42.500 --> 19:44.119
Ahmed, hey.

19:44.153 --> 19:46.221
Yes, he arrived, but I just got home.

19:46.255 --> 19:49.400
I'm barely settled. I wasn't expecting...

19:50.777 --> 19:53.429
Don't you
have anyone else that cou...

19:54.116 --> 19:57.899
Okay. Okay, okay. Um...

19:57.934 --> 20:01.269
Yeah. I'll work with him,
I'll see what I can do.

20:01.304 --> 20:03.567
I'll let you know once I've seen him.

20:03.877 --> 20:05.706
Okay. Bye.

20:10.642 --> 20:14.936
Spartan... Nothing's easy, is it?

20:21.079 --> 20:22.790
Hey,
so what's the new horse's name?

20:22.825 --> 20:24.859
- Uh, Gypsy.
- What's wrong with him?

20:24.893 --> 20:26.861
Ahmed bought him as a Grand Prix jumper

20:26.895 --> 20:30.130
and apparently he's
inconsistent and uncooperative,

20:30.165 --> 20:31.565
and he wants me to fix him.

20:31.599 --> 20:33.133
Sounds pretty simple.

20:33.168 --> 20:34.468
It's pretty much what you
were doing on the tour, right?

20:34.502 --> 20:36.670
And you were obviously amazing at it.

20:36.704 --> 20:38.372
Thanks, Georgie. I just...

20:38.406 --> 20:40.507
I wasn't quite ready to get back work yet.

20:40.541 --> 20:43.710
Well, I read somewhere
that you had an assistant

20:43.744 --> 20:45.979
while you were on the tour
to help you with the horses

20:46.013 --> 20:48.815
- and get them trained.
- Yeah, I did.

20:48.850 --> 20:52.676
So, I was thinking...
maybe I could be your assistant.

20:52.696 --> 20:54.352
I'm a really hard worker.

20:54.372 --> 20:55.722
I can see that.

20:55.756 --> 20:58.509
Looks like you've been doing lots of work
while I've been gone.

20:58.529 --> 20:59.860
Yeah, it's been fun.

20:59.894 --> 21:01.727
It took us a little while to
get used to you not being here

21:01.761 --> 21:04.707
but it all kind of fell into place.

21:04.727 --> 21:06.440
That's good.

21:07.334 --> 21:08.567
Yup!

21:08.602 --> 21:10.436
Yup! Yah!

21:10.471 --> 21:12.605
Yah!

21:12.639 --> 21:15.408
Okay, let's see this horse of yours.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.009
Yup!

21:17.043 --> 21:18.811
Whoa, whoa...

21:18.845 --> 21:19.907
Yup!

21:20.167 --> 21:21.079
Yup!

21:21.892 --> 21:23.516
Not bad.

21:24.102 --> 21:26.619
It's got an innate ability.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.884
You see "innate ability." I can see it.

21:28.904 --> 21:30.956
Can you see "innate ability"?

21:30.991 --> 21:34.513
"Hot shots" would have a
dozen buyers for that horse, but...

21:34.533 --> 21:38.435
I know you guys wanna go it alone.

21:39.862 --> 21:41.686
Good on you.

21:44.203 --> 21:46.905
Hey, Georgie?
Have you seen the lunge line?

21:46.939 --> 21:49.779
Things have been moved around.
I can't find a thing.

21:51.628 --> 21:53.978
Oh,
he's all warmed up and ready to go!

21:54.013 --> 21:57.216
And I've set up all the
jumps like you asked me to.

21:58.370 --> 22:00.485
I hope it's okay.

22:00.505 --> 22:02.706
Canter! Canter!

22:37.248 --> 22:39.350
You know, it's really weird.

22:39.370 --> 22:40.951
He likes going over the tall jumps,

22:40.971 --> 22:44.694
but he's not even trying
over the little ones.

22:44.904 --> 22:46.929
Why don't you try raising
up the lower jumps?

22:46.964 --> 22:49.699
- Okay.
- And we'll see how that goes.

23:10.812 --> 23:14.789
He's got lots of jump,
but it's almost like he loses interest.

23:14.824 --> 23:17.259
Don't worry, you'll
figure him out. You always do.

23:17.293 --> 23:20.698
So what time should we start tomorrow?
Is there anything I can do to prep?

23:20.718 --> 23:23.232
No. Georgie, you've already done enough.

23:23.266 --> 23:25.985
Hey, guys. Take a break.
I got snacks inside.

23:26.005 --> 23:27.598
I can't. I gotta untack Gypsy.

23:27.618 --> 23:29.094
No, I can do it. It's okay.

23:29.114 --> 23:31.030
No way!
I bet you never had to untack a horse

23:31.050 --> 23:32.606
while you were on the tour.

23:32.626 --> 23:34.524
You don't have to here either.

23:36.812 --> 23:38.488
She's your number one fan.
You know that.

23:38.508 --> 23:40.245
Like she idolizes you.

23:40.265 --> 23:44.360
- Have you seen her bulletin board?
- Yes, I saw it.

23:45.700 --> 23:46.958
I know I should be flattered,

23:46.978 --> 23:49.068
but I just want things
to go back to normal.

23:49.088 --> 23:50.931
You know... I never thought I'd say this,

23:50.951 --> 23:52.793
but I miss the old opinionated Georgie

23:52.827 --> 23:55.448
who didn't take anything from anyone and...

23:55.468 --> 23:57.843
Now, she thinks I have all the answers.

23:57.863 --> 23:58.966
It's a lot of pressure.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.036
You were all she wanted to talk
about while you were away, Amy.

24:02.579 --> 24:05.221
- She's just excited to have you home.
- Yeah, I know.

24:05.345 --> 24:07.174
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow?

24:07.194 --> 24:10.343
I was thinking maybe we could take a drive,
see what's for sale out there.

24:10.363 --> 24:12.579
Drive around in what?

24:13.118 --> 24:15.302
You know, I've been thinking, Amy,

24:15.322 --> 24:16.995
maybe I just give up on fixing it

24:17.015 --> 24:19.683
and I use some of the ranch
money to buy a new one.

24:19.956 --> 24:23.021
Yeah. You could do that...

24:23.544 --> 24:24.990
But you fixed your truck before.

24:25.024 --> 24:26.452
Well, yeah,
but it's full of third-hand parts;

24:26.472 --> 24:28.115
that's why it keeps stalling on me.

24:28.135 --> 24:29.691
So that's it? We're...

24:29.711 --> 24:32.222
We're just going to put
that money into a new truck?

24:32.347 --> 24:33.228
Well, not all of it.

24:33.248 --> 24:35.267
But we're gonna stop
looking for a new place?

24:35.970 --> 24:38.147
No! No, we can still look.

24:38.167 --> 24:39.571
But I'm not sure how
long that's gonna take,

24:39.605 --> 24:42.307
and in the meantime,
I gotta get this truck situation fixed.

24:47.199 --> 24:48.370
Amy, what's wrong?

24:48.390 --> 24:51.207
I love your old truck.

24:52.525 --> 24:53.919
And I guess I can't figure out

24:53.953 --> 24:57.288
why you're not more upset
about losing this ranch.

24:57.750 --> 24:59.082
Wait a sec. What are you saying?

24:59.102 --> 25:01.204
I know the real estate
agent dropped the ball...

25:01.224 --> 25:02.147
Yeah, they did.

25:02.167 --> 25:06.631
But, in a way, you did too.

25:06.833 --> 25:09.183
I mean, you never followed up,
you never did anything,

25:09.203 --> 25:13.030
- and you were here and I wasn't!
- Exactly! You weren't here, Amy!

25:13.050 --> 25:13.964
What does that matter?

25:13.984 --> 25:15.701
We could've bought the
place four months ago.

25:15.721 --> 25:19.052
What was I supposed to do?
I couldn't get a solid answer from you,

25:19.072 --> 25:20.553
and I sure as hell couldn't
get a clear picture

25:20.573 --> 25:23.936
of where you stood... on anything!

25:31.259 --> 25:32.764
Lou.

25:32.784 --> 25:36.790
There is something I've
been meaning to talk to you about.

25:36.810 --> 25:40.223
- I probably should have months ago.
- Okay.

25:40.794 --> 25:45.087
You see, Lisa and I, we um...

25:47.467 --> 25:49.933
Well, we...

25:50.408 --> 25:53.602
Well, we kind of fell apart after my...
my uh...

25:54.168 --> 25:56.844
- Heart attack?
- Yeah, that.

25:57.167 --> 26:00.175
- But we managed to patch things up.
- I know.

26:00.209 --> 26:05.614
And I realize that you're
not always her biggest fan...

26:05.649 --> 26:08.863
Okay, that is not true.
I really like Lisa. She just...

26:08.883 --> 26:10.997
You know what Ty wants to do?

26:11.017 --> 26:12.635
No I don't.

26:12.655 --> 26:14.062
He wants to buy a new truck!

26:14.082 --> 26:15.973
Buy it with part of the
money that we were gonna use

26:15.993 --> 26:17.059
for the down payment.

26:17.093 --> 26:20.807
Oh, okay. I...
am not getting involved in this.

26:20.827 --> 26:23.202
Amy... Ty needs a truck that runs.

26:23.222 --> 26:26.094
He's got- he's gotta get to
school and to the vet clinic.

26:26.114 --> 26:27.568
What're you so mad about?

26:27.588 --> 26:29.641
'Cause this wasn't the
way it was supposed to be.

26:29.661 --> 26:31.254
How was it supposed to be?

26:31.274 --> 26:33.174
I was supposed to come home

26:33.208 --> 26:35.543
and we'd buy the ranch and settle down...

26:35.577 --> 26:37.478
Why are you guys in
such a big rush to move?

26:37.512 --> 26:41.115
I don't get why you're so
intent on buying a place.

26:41.149 --> 26:43.284
You know,
you have a perfectly good home here.

26:43.318 --> 26:45.953
Oh, yeah? It doesn't feel like home.

26:45.987 --> 26:47.821
What is that supposed to mean?

26:50.112 --> 26:52.395
It just feels different.

26:53.611 --> 26:55.361
Okay. Amy, look.

26:55.396 --> 26:57.898
You and Ty having this
fight is perfectly normal.

26:57.932 --> 27:00.366
It's just re-entry pains.

27:00.401 --> 27:02.535
You know,
Peter and I go through it all the time.

27:02.570 --> 27:04.437
The first night he gets back is awesome.

27:04.472 --> 27:06.606
The second day,
we usually have a huge fight,

27:06.640 --> 27:08.608
and by the time he leaves we're fine again.

27:08.642 --> 27:12.511
It's... it's just a cycle.

27:12.933 --> 27:17.033
And it happens time after time,
but it'll get better, okay?

27:17.053 --> 27:18.733
I promise.

27:25.240 --> 27:26.558
It's Ty.

27:27.151 --> 27:28.360
You should talk to him.

27:31.075 --> 27:33.247
Hello?

27:34.475 --> 27:36.424
I'm sorry, too.

27:38.496 --> 27:40.705
I know, and I...
I understand about the truck.

27:40.740 --> 27:44.863
I do. I've just been feeling kind of um...

27:45.273 --> 27:47.258
disconnected.

27:48.313 --> 27:52.416
Coming home just hasn't been as easy
as I thought it would be.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.128
Let's nail that guy.

28:03.162 --> 28:05.329
- Hollis!
- Okay. See you.

28:05.364 --> 28:06.364
- Hey.
- Just the man I wanted to see!

28:06.398 --> 28:08.432
- How's it going, Caleb?
- It's great!

28:08.467 --> 28:11.684
So, uh, you can come by and see those
horses of mine whenever you want.

28:11.704 --> 28:14.138
Just name the time.
Caleb's done an incredible job with them.

28:14.173 --> 28:15.573
I'm sure you'll be very impressed.

28:15.607 --> 28:19.009
Hey, uh, look, guys, um...
I went with somebody else.

28:19.044 --> 28:20.444
I thought you said that...

28:20.479 --> 28:22.789
Whoa, hold on a second.
I thought we had a deal.

28:22.809 --> 28:24.948
Oh, come on. We didn't have a deal.

28:24.983 --> 28:27.666
All right, somebody gave me a better price
for the same quality of horse.

28:27.686 --> 28:29.670
I mean, I can't fight that.

28:29.690 --> 28:31.432
Who gave you a better price?

28:31.452 --> 28:33.123
"Hot shots."

28:38.165 --> 28:41.164
Oh! What's that?

28:41.199 --> 28:43.700
We are making the announcement tonight.

28:43.720 --> 28:45.060
It's time.

28:45.420 --> 28:46.469
- Okay.
- Okay.

28:46.504 --> 28:49.038
So I was thinking we would do it at dessert

28:49.073 --> 28:51.049
and then... pop a little bubbly.

28:51.069 --> 28:52.297
Yeah.

28:59.116 --> 29:01.550
Hollis pursued me. I can't help that.

29:01.585 --> 29:03.970
Oh, really?
You went behind our back, Tim!

29:03.990 --> 29:07.090
Yeah, well, that's business, boys,

29:07.328 --> 29:09.792
and it's a lesson you two should learn
sooner rather than later.

29:09.827 --> 29:11.427
Now, take it from me,
the voice of experience,

29:11.461 --> 29:13.634
you were overly optimistic.

29:13.654 --> 29:15.950
You put all your eggs in one basket.

29:15.970 --> 29:18.130
Rookie mistake.

29:19.768 --> 29:23.339
Aw... all right, here's the deal.

29:23.764 --> 29:26.181
If you want to join me in "Hot Shots,"

29:26.678 --> 29:27.943
I'll consider it.

29:27.977 --> 29:32.001
Yeah, uh... no.
We don't need any help.

29:36.219 --> 29:37.819
Grandpa,
can I talk to you about the barn?

29:37.854 --> 29:40.706
- Sure! What's to talk about?
- Well, it's too small.

29:40.726 --> 29:42.190
I can't run a business
out of it the way it is.

29:42.225 --> 29:43.992
Well, you've done pretty well so far.

29:44.026 --> 29:45.521
I don't even have room for Ahmed's horse

29:45.541 --> 29:47.262
and he cannot stay outside.

29:47.296 --> 29:49.530
I can take Harley and Phoenix out.
They don't need to be in the barn.

29:49.565 --> 29:50.931
You see? A solution right there.

29:50.966 --> 29:53.861
No! That is not a solution, okay?

29:53.881 --> 29:56.170
I have to be realistic.
We need to build on.

29:56.204 --> 29:58.673
I... I made a bit of a
name for myself in Europe,

29:58.707 --> 30:01.509
and I'm gonna be getting some
pretty expensive horses in to train.

30:01.529 --> 30:03.110
I have to be prepared, grandpa.

30:03.145 --> 30:05.232
What would clients think
bringing their high end animal

30:05.252 --> 30:06.547
to a four-stall barn.

30:06.567 --> 30:09.851
Well, it seems to me you've picked up
some pretty high flown ideas over there.

30:09.871 --> 30:11.253
Whoa, whoa, whoa! High flown? Really?

30:11.273 --> 30:14.255
Hey!
You two, it's open for discussion.

30:14.289 --> 30:17.031
How about a little dessert?
Can I get that going?

30:17.180 --> 30:20.559
- I'll get Amy's!
- I can get it myself, Georgie!

30:21.850 --> 30:22.729
Hi, Ty!

30:22.764 --> 30:25.404
Amy! Come on outside.
I got something to show you.

30:30.225 --> 30:31.904
Look at this baby!

30:32.161 --> 30:34.482
The guy let me take it for a test drive.

30:34.804 --> 30:37.075
What do you think?

30:37.110 --> 30:41.446
Um... if that's what makes
you happy then go for it.

30:41.466 --> 30:44.635
What're you talking about?
Just last night you said that uh...

30:44.655 --> 30:46.384
What's the problem?

30:46.419 --> 30:49.487
Your old truck has so
many memories for both of us

30:49.522 --> 30:53.253
and this... this is just a big,
ugly, shiny hunk of metal!

30:53.273 --> 30:54.359
Amy, you're being...

30:54.393 --> 30:55.794
You know what, Lou?
Just stay out of this, please.

30:55.829 --> 31:00.426
Okay. Amy, come on, we'll
go for a spin. You'll see.

31:00.446 --> 31:02.407
I don't want to.

31:04.268 --> 31:07.495
Fine. I can't win here, can I?

31:09.803 --> 31:12.377
Amy...

31:12.913 --> 31:16.765
- What's wrong?
- This! All of this is wrong.

31:16.785 --> 31:19.731
I came home to an empty house
and now, even with all of you here,

31:19.751 --> 31:22.727
it still feels empty.

31:22.747 --> 31:25.403
I just feel like I don't live here anymore.

31:35.294 --> 31:38.849
Amy, what's really going on here?

31:40.995 --> 31:43.006
I don't know.

31:44.823 --> 31:49.010
You know, I couldn't wait to come home

31:49.030 --> 31:52.144
and now that I'm here,

31:52.164 --> 31:54.347
I feel like I don't belong.

31:55.253 --> 31:59.758
And... and everyone... Has changed.

32:00.639 --> 32:02.314
Maybe so.

32:02.649 --> 32:05.656
But I think you've changed too.

32:05.947 --> 32:09.273
And I think it scares the heck out of you.

32:10.811 --> 32:15.932
Look, the experience you
had over there was amazing

32:16.371 --> 32:19.436
and it's bound to have changed you.

32:19.895 --> 32:23.685
You and I, neither of us likes change.

32:25.281 --> 32:29.206
If we had to admit it,
I'd say we're kind of afraid of it.

32:30.050 --> 32:32.081
But...

32:32.457 --> 32:35.118
Amy, things don't stay the same.

32:35.497 --> 32:37.859
And you going away, well...

32:37.879 --> 32:40.256
It did change things, yeah.

32:40.290 --> 32:44.407
But that's not a bad thing,
it's just...different.

32:45.685 --> 32:48.015
You need to just go with it.

32:48.462 --> 32:50.025
Yeah.

32:54.431 --> 32:58.007
You know, Amy,
this place doesn't run without you

32:58.560 --> 33:01.117
and we would never want it to.

33:02.891 --> 33:04.293
Okay.

33:22.140 --> 33:24.336
Can I come in?

33:28.237 --> 33:31.073
I wanted to apologize for
snapping at you at dinner.

33:31.093 --> 33:32.917
It wasn't fair.

33:34.444 --> 33:38.072
And... you have been a huge help to me

33:38.092 --> 33:40.682
and I really appreciate it.

33:46.048 --> 33:47.157
What's all that?

33:47.177 --> 33:52.217
I know.
Ty says I'm like some crazy stalker,

33:52.237 --> 33:54.562
but it was fun to follow you on the tour.

33:54.582 --> 33:56.064
It was almost like I was there.

33:56.084 --> 33:58.608
But I'm glad you're back home.

33:58.628 --> 34:00.300
Things can finally go back to normal.

34:00.334 --> 34:03.563
Hey, I am all for normal.

34:03.583 --> 34:07.372
You know, Georgie,
just because I went on that tour,

34:07.392 --> 34:09.760
doesn't mean you have
to treat me differently.

34:09.780 --> 34:11.311
I'm still just me.

34:11.706 --> 34:13.859
Not really.

34:13.879 --> 34:16.527
I mean,
you used to love the barn the way it was.

34:16.547 --> 34:19.351
You never used to be ashamed of it before.

34:20.481 --> 34:22.589
Now there's the Georgie I know and love.

34:22.623 --> 34:24.357
Not afraid to call a spade a spade.

34:24.391 --> 34:25.858
Well, it was kind of snobby.

34:25.891 --> 34:28.438
Honestly, you do not know snobby.

34:28.458 --> 34:31.931
You should've met some of
those people on that tour!

34:31.965 --> 34:34.833
So... can I still be your assistant?

34:34.868 --> 34:37.817
No. I don't need an assistant.

34:38.027 --> 34:40.699
You can still help me with Gypsy though,

34:40.719 --> 34:42.975
but as my partner.

34:43.429 --> 34:44.869
All right?

34:48.282 --> 34:51.049
Yeah, it's a great truck.

34:51.083 --> 34:52.917
I'll be by later to sign the papers.

34:54.175 --> 34:56.215
Okay. I'll see you then.

35:00.069 --> 35:01.626
What? Tim been harassing you again?

35:01.661 --> 35:03.795
I think we made a mistake about Tim.

35:04.189 --> 35:05.664
I don't think so, buddy.

35:05.698 --> 35:07.656
I think we really need to
take him up on his offer.

35:07.676 --> 35:09.634
What? Why?

35:09.669 --> 35:12.901
We, uh, we actually can't afford
to board the horses at the rodeo grounds

35:12.921 --> 35:14.906
for more than a few weeks.

35:14.940 --> 35:16.708
Now, because Hollis turned us down,

35:16.742 --> 35:19.577
I mean, it could be months.
We're over-extended.

35:20.111 --> 35:21.945
How? Are you sure?

35:21.980 --> 35:24.948
Take a look at the bills.
We need money.

35:24.983 --> 35:27.716
I don't think we have any other choice.

35:33.362 --> 35:35.059
Hey, Caleb, wait.

35:35.499 --> 35:37.311
Hold on a sec.

35:37.796 --> 35:40.397
We're not going with Tim. There's no way.

35:40.431 --> 35:42.632
I'll top up my investment with a loan.

35:42.667 --> 35:44.168
I don't need to buy this truck right now.

35:44.202 --> 35:47.738
Besides, I wouldn't have all this extra
money if it wasn't for you, right?

35:48.464 --> 35:49.394
Are you sure?

35:49.414 --> 35:53.080
Yeah. What are business partners for?

35:54.060 --> 35:56.021
All right.

36:11.553 --> 36:14.653
You know...
Georgie, maybe I should just let this go.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.031
Everyone, including myself,

36:16.065 --> 36:20.360
is making this horse do something
that clearly he doesn't wanna do.

36:22.557 --> 36:24.456
Actually...

36:25.041 --> 36:27.954
You know what?
I want to try one more thing.

36:28.338 --> 36:29.877
Free jumping.

36:32.992 --> 36:34.722
All right, Gypsy,

36:34.742 --> 36:37.184
let's see what you've got.

36:53.668 --> 36:56.737
Whoa! That is amazing!

36:56.989 --> 36:58.939
Ahmed, Gypsy is incredible.

36:58.974 --> 37:01.242
We need to train him as a puissance horse.

37:01.276 --> 37:03.324
He loves to jump,
just not the whole course.

37:03.344 --> 37:05.346
Just a single high jump.

37:05.366 --> 37:08.148
He has no fear. You have to keep him!

37:08.791 --> 37:10.317
Gah... I know.

37:10.351 --> 37:13.553
I know it's not the field you
intended him to be in, but...

37:14.516 --> 37:15.622
No. No.

37:15.657 --> 37:16.990
I don't think he should be re-homed.

37:17.024 --> 37:19.224
Because what happens if
they don't understand him?

37:19.244 --> 37:22.595
No. Ahmed, fine, I'll buy him then.

37:22.629 --> 37:24.630
Yes, I'm serious.

37:24.650 --> 37:26.413
Okay, call me back.

37:28.019 --> 37:30.937
Gypsy is amazing!
He must have jumped 7 feet.

37:30.971 --> 37:33.207
He completely soared over those jumps.

37:33.227 --> 37:35.341
Wow...

37:35.375 --> 37:37.658
Sorry to barge in here.

37:37.678 --> 37:40.279
- Ty...
- Amy, I'm sorry.

37:40.314 --> 37:42.981
I'm sorry for being so horrible.

37:43.016 --> 37:45.082
Hey! Look what I found in the fridge.

37:45.102 --> 37:46.552
Whose is it?

37:46.586 --> 37:48.153
Amy, did you bring this back from France?

37:48.188 --> 37:49.847
Uh, no.

37:49.867 --> 37:51.331
Uh... I... I, um... we...

37:56.787 --> 37:59.597
Well, Lou, that is uh...

37:59.632 --> 38:03.277
Come on, Jack,
your wife is chomping at the bit.

38:05.387 --> 38:09.147
- Did you just say "wife"?
- Mm-hmm. He sure did.

38:13.900 --> 38:15.476
So...

38:15.496 --> 38:17.846
you two... you guys are married.

38:17.847 --> 38:19.780
Like, actually married?

38:19.814 --> 38:21.114
Yeah, we are.

38:21.148 --> 38:22.549
That is so cool!

38:22.584 --> 38:25.352
It is not cool! How could you not...

38:25.387 --> 38:28.033
Um... when? When did this happen?

38:28.053 --> 38:29.556
The day of the futurity race.

38:29.591 --> 38:30.974
That is months ago!

38:30.994 --> 38:33.233
- Really?!
- How could you not tell us?!

38:33.253 --> 38:35.028
- I knew.
- How did he know?

38:35.062 --> 38:36.196
I was his best man.

38:36.230 --> 38:37.879
You were not the best man.

38:37.899 --> 38:40.934
Wait, wait, wait!
There was a wedding without us,

38:40.968 --> 38:43.736
but dad was there? Grandpa?!

38:44.258 --> 38:46.239
Lou, it wasn't like that.

38:46.274 --> 38:47.607
Lou, you have to understand...

38:47.641 --> 38:50.010
No, no.
I'm sorry, I-I don't understand.

38:50.044 --> 38:51.511
They wanted to keep it a secret.

38:51.545 --> 38:52.845
Mmm...

38:53.197 --> 38:54.468
Uh... wha...

38:54.488 --> 38:56.682
- Well, congratulations.
- Yeah.

38:56.717 --> 38:58.384
- Thank you.
- Wow!

38:58.419 --> 39:01.086
Mm-hmm. Wow is right!

39:01.121 --> 39:03.110
Oh...

39:04.102 --> 39:07.226
Oh, you are perfect.
How could you have done that?

39:07.260 --> 39:08.655
Well, I'm glad he did.

39:08.675 --> 39:11.881
It was obvious you weren't gonna
say anything about it at all.

39:13.904 --> 39:17.403
Lisa! Just wait!

39:17.437 --> 39:19.657
Lisa! Wait!

39:22.842 --> 39:26.478
Do you regret marrying me?
Are you ashamed of me?

39:26.512 --> 39:30.114
No! No nothing like that.

39:36.340 --> 39:40.340
This was our thing, our moment.

39:40.360 --> 39:43.367
This was our secret for just the two of us.

39:43.387 --> 39:45.964
And the minute you start
involving other people,

39:45.998 --> 39:48.784
there's expectations, opinions.

39:48.804 --> 39:51.469
You just saw for yourself
what happened in there.

39:51.503 --> 39:53.004
That would not have happened in there

39:53.038 --> 39:54.393
if we'd told everybody sooner!

39:54.413 --> 39:57.533
And we should've told
everybody right off the bat.

39:57.553 --> 40:00.936
It was wrong not to and that is my fault.

40:00.956 --> 40:04.436
No it's not;
We made that decision together.

40:05.230 --> 40:07.948
But more importantly,

40:09.743 --> 40:12.002
are you glad you even did it?

40:12.022 --> 40:13.776
Be honest because... Because, Jack,

40:13.796 --> 40:16.474
standing with you in the
snow with the lights,

40:16.494 --> 40:18.630
saying "I do,"

40:19.164 --> 40:22.303
was one of the most
beautiful moments of my life.

40:24.152 --> 40:26.862
I need you to give me the ring.

40:26.882 --> 40:28.607
What do you mean?

40:48.037 --> 40:50.094
Lisa Stillman,

40:51.335 --> 40:53.842
will you marry me?

40:55.165 --> 40:57.629
I don't know...

41:04.429 --> 41:06.030
Yes.

41:09.539 --> 41:13.795
Now that... is on there for good.

41:14.366 --> 41:15.951
No hiding it.

41:47.849 --> 41:49.249
Agreed.

41:53.176 --> 41:56.316
I should've never blamed
you for losing the ranch.

41:56.336 --> 41:58.525
I've been thinking a
lot about what you said

41:58.560 --> 42:01.895

42:01.929 --> 42:03.697

42:04.064 --> 42:05.932
It wasn't fair.

42:06.261 --> 42:08.102
You and I are partners,

42:08.136 --> 42:10.070
and if I could do it all over again,

42:10.105 --> 42:11.984
I would have never gone. It was a mistake.

42:12.004 --> 42:14.280
No, Amy, it wasn't a mistake.

That's pretty generous.
Why would he do that?

42:55.833 --> 42:58.824
How could you keep that from me, dad?
Just tell me! How?!
