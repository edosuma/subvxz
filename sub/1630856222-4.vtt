15:54.150 --> 15:55.820
and have to find them
themselves?
Yeah. How do people find you?

15:55.820 --> 15:57.620
We have a great
social-media following.

15:57.620 --> 16:00.250
So, we -- You know,
as you can imagine,

16:00.250 --> 16:03.520
we kind of blew up on TikTok
because weddings plus dogs,

16:03.520 --> 16:05.390
it's content gold.
Right.

16:05.390 --> 16:08.500
So we've been really fortunate
in that aspect.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.300
Who's your
oldest franchisee?

16:11.300 --> 16:15.470
Our first franchisee actually
is in the marriage capital

16:15.470 --> 16:16.840
of the world,
Las Vegas.

16:16.840 --> 16:19.140
So that was a very exciting
first franchise to launch.

16:19.140 --> 16:21.510
So, our top-performing
franchisee

16:21.510 --> 16:24.480
is doing about
$2,200 a month,

16:24.480 --> 16:26.310
and they've been in business
for nine months.

16:26.310 --> 16:27.680
$2,200 a month?

16:27.680 --> 16:28.720
Yes.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.280
With that kind
of money, $2,200,

16:30.280 --> 16:33.220
you can't really
do it full time.

16:33.220 --> 16:36.260
What are your gross sales
for all of your franchisees,

16:36.260 --> 16:38.430
your own shop this past year?

16:38.430 --> 16:40.360
So if we look
at this past year,

16:40.360 --> 16:43.970
including our franchisees,
what is it combined?

16:43.970 --> 16:45.730
It's about $80,000
in the franchises

16:45.730 --> 16:47.670
and then $123,000
from Tampa.

16:47.670 --> 16:49.740
How did you get to franchise
when your sales

16:49.740 --> 16:51.470
aren't even $250,000?

16:51.470 --> 16:52.810
Well, it's unique
enough, right?

16:52.810 --> 16:55.310
And it's expensive to do
the franchising, as well.

16:55.310 --> 16:56.480
Nova: You know,
and we did invest --

16:56.480 --> 16:58.180
Ladies, I love dogs.
Yeah.

16:58.180 --> 16:59.610
Loved having our dog
at our wedding.

16:59.610 --> 17:01.050
It's just so small.

17:01.050 --> 17:02.850
I think it's a great business
for you guys.

17:02.850 --> 17:08.020
I just don't see how it would
get to critical mass.

17:08.020 --> 17:09.860
It's not for me. I'm out.

17:09.860 --> 17:11.560
We understand.
Thank you so much.

17:11.560 --> 17:15.030
You guys, listen,
I always think it's so great

17:15.030 --> 17:17.770
when people are clever
and creative.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.800
It's not a big enough
thing for me.

17:19.800 --> 17:22.000
I like to get involved
in things

17:22.000 --> 17:24.710
that I really think
I can grow huge.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.710
And so,
I wish you good luck,

17:26.710 --> 17:29.410
but, unfortunately,
on this one, I'm out.

17:29.410 --> 17:32.310
Thank you so much,
and just to touch on

17:32.310 --> 17:35.050
the growth aspect,
with our franchise model,

17:35.050 --> 17:38.350
we are collecting
those initial franchise fees,

17:38.350 --> 17:40.990
so anywhere from
$12,500 to $44,000.

17:40.990 --> 17:42.190
Which is good
for you guys, right?

17:42.190 --> 17:44.060
But here's my challenge.

17:44.060 --> 17:46.960
If a territory has
3,000 weddings in the year

17:46.960 --> 17:49.000
and you do 1,000
of those weddings,

17:49.000 --> 17:52.900
that's $3 million a territory,
and you guys will make your 9%.

17:52.900 --> 17:56.040
So that's $270,000 times,

17:56.040 --> 17:58.310
you know,
30 territories you may have.

17:58.310 --> 18:00.440
That's just not
a big enough number

18:00.440 --> 18:02.810
to really get me excited
as an investment.

18:02.810 --> 18:04.810
And that's for perfection,
right?

18:04.810 --> 18:08.820
That's if you just get every
wedding that has, you know,

18:08.820 --> 18:10.720
a hamster associated with it.

18:10.720 --> 18:13.550
So I don't think the scale
is enough for me to get excited.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.890
So for those reasons, I'm out.
But congratulations.

18:15.890 --> 18:18.130
I think it's a brilliant idea.
It's clever. Very clever.

18:18.130 --> 18:19.430
I think it's
great for you guys.

18:19.430 --> 18:21.960
We are ready now
to scale.

18:21.960 --> 18:24.070
I mean, we did take
the first year in franchising,

18:24.070 --> 18:27.600
so I do understand that,
right now, those sales are low.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.770
You have two Sharks left,
ladies, and one of them

18:30.770 --> 18:33.240
calls himself
Mr. Wonderful Wedding.

18:33.240 --> 18:34.810
It's true. It's true.
And I do want to mention that,

18:34.810 --> 18:35.980
because we haven't
brought it up yet,

18:35.980 --> 18:37.080
that we are
a mission-driven brand.

18:37.080 --> 18:38.580
Yes.
So a big part of what we do

18:38.580 --> 18:40.310
has been getting involved
in our community

18:40.310 --> 18:41.950
and helping shelter animals,
because from day one,

18:41.950 --> 18:43.720
we knew that was
what we wanted this company...

18:43.720 --> 18:44.890
Good for you.
...to also be.

18:44.890 --> 18:46.290
Yeah, good for you guys.
And so we volunteered --

18:46.290 --> 18:47.790
You know, Ilana, if this doesn't
work out for you, you know

18:47.790 --> 18:49.920
at the end of radio commercials,
when they tell you...

18:49.920 --> 18:51.360
[ Speaking gibberish ]

18:51.360 --> 18:53.360
Talking too fast?
That's got to be you.

18:53.360 --> 18:54.860
You're doing great, Ilana.
It's perfect.

18:54.860 --> 18:56.230
I have six brothers
and sisters,

18:56.230 --> 18:58.170
so you learn to be quick
and loud if you wanna be heard.

18:58.170 --> 18:59.570
No, I know.

18:59.570 --> 19:02.770
You're able to articulate
at extreme high velocity.

19:02.770 --> 19:04.110
I like fast talkers.

19:04.110 --> 19:05.510
Corcoran: But, you know,
you haven't articulated

19:05.510 --> 19:07.640
something that, in my mind,
is the most important thing

19:07.640 --> 19:08.710
in the franchise business.
Yes.

19:08.710 --> 19:10.340
Absolutely.
Choosing the people.

19:10.340 --> 19:11.850
Yeah.
I remember when I invested

19:11.850 --> 19:13.150
in Cousins Maine Lobster,

19:13.150 --> 19:16.550
they only were making $60,000
in only one month

19:16.550 --> 19:18.420
until they went
to a franchise model.

19:18.420 --> 19:21.490
However, I learned a lot.
It was my first franchise.

19:21.490 --> 19:25.330
I learned that it was very easy
to get a franchise in.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.900
It was very difficult
to keep the franchise in.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.460
And that's why we only
opened the four

19:29.460 --> 19:31.530
and took a minute to
make sure that these four

19:31.530 --> 19:33.530
were stable, solid...
That's smart. That's smart.

19:33.530 --> 19:34.540
...yeah,
before we continued.

19:34.540 --> 19:35.970
Which is the right way
to do.

19:35.970 --> 19:39.840
Of those franchisees that apply,
what percentage do you accept?

19:39.840 --> 19:42.840
So, we've had about
100 organic inquiries

19:42.840 --> 19:45.180
come in specifically about
our franchise business,

19:45.180 --> 19:46.750
and we've only accepted
the four so far.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.180
-Wow.
-Wow.

19:48.180 --> 19:49.320
We still have
20 in the pipeline...
Greiner: That's good.

19:49.320 --> 19:50.820
...that we're working with
that we don't know yet

19:50.820 --> 19:51.920
if they're going
to actually play out.
Yes.

19:51.920 --> 19:53.020
O'Leary: So you're being
very selective.

19:53.020 --> 19:54.020
The only thing missing
with this story

19:54.020 --> 19:55.290
is numbers
aren't big enough,

19:55.290 --> 19:58.060
because franchisees
have to make a living.

19:58.060 --> 19:59.360
It's a great
side business.

19:59.360 --> 20:00.660
It's a lifestyle business.
There are lifestyle franchises.

20:00.660 --> 20:02.660
And it really is a lifestyle
business. Exactly.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.100
Yeah,
if you love animals,

20:04.100 --> 20:05.430
this is a way to get paid.
This is the way to go.

20:05.430 --> 20:07.500
Yeah.
Plus, we have
that mission aspect.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.000
You know what? I'd like
to make an offer, alright?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.270
What I really love
about your business

20:12.270 --> 20:14.510
is it's at its inception,
which I love.

20:14.510 --> 20:18.150
I like the fact you tried five
people before going gangbusters.

20:18.150 --> 20:20.480
I invested in
three different franchises.

20:20.480 --> 20:23.250
All went bust because
they brought in the wrong people

20:23.250 --> 20:24.550
and they grew too fast,

20:24.550 --> 20:28.120
and I could not slow them down
to qualify their people.

20:28.120 --> 20:30.190
What I like also about
your business is I think

20:30.190 --> 20:32.890
there's a huge market
for dog lovers

20:32.890 --> 20:34.500
who want to work part time

20:34.500 --> 20:37.130
and make a part-time living
and a supplementary income.
Exactly.

20:37.130 --> 20:40.570
So I'll make you an offer
of $75,000 for 25%.

20:41.970 --> 20:44.110
Wow. Thank you so much
for your offer.
Yes.

have an offer?

Here's my offer. I'm sorry
the way I'm looking at it,

saying to myself,
"It's so small right now,

20:56.580 --> 20:58.520
I could make
hundreds of dollars."

20:58.520 --> 21:00.860
[ Laughter ]
I mean, it's --
I would do --

21:00.860 --> 21:04.060
I would do the $75,000,

21:04.060 --> 21:05.460
but I want to be
the third partner.

21:05.460 --> 21:06.760
I want 33 1/3%

21:06.760 --> 21:09.500
And then I put
the accelerator on it.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.670
Ladies, two very
interesting offers.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.000
Yes.
What are you going to do?

21:13.000 --> 21:17.200
Thank you so much,
Mr. Wonderful, for your offer.

21:17.200 --> 21:18.510
Yeah.

21:18.510 --> 21:24.580
Barbara, would you consider
the $75,000 for 15%?

21:24.580 --> 21:25.980
Oh, no.

21:25.980 --> 21:27.750
I'm going to put a heck
of a lot of work into this

21:27.750 --> 21:30.150
because I know how to do
franchising better

21:30.150 --> 21:32.250
than anyone
I've ever met, okay?

21:32.250 --> 21:33.720
I know how to qualify people.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.120
I know how to build
a team of the franchisees.

of getting people together,

21:38.260 --> 21:39.490

with franchising.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.730

Would you potentially be willing
to do $75,000 for 20%?

21:50.100 --> 21:52.570
No, but I'll do it for 22%.
It's a happy number.

this technology --

27:47.160 --> 27:49.060
And let me explain about
technology.

27:49.060 --> 27:51.830
So, currently,
clothing has a linear life.

27:51.830 --> 27:53.500
All the things
we are wearing right now,

27:53.500 --> 27:55.600
it will spend hundreds of years

27:55.600 --> 27:58.710
until it brokes down,
polluting the planet, obviously.

27:58.710 --> 28:02.510
So my suggestion and
my technology works like this --

28:02.510 --> 28:04.040
You buy a Monosuit for us,

28:04.040 --> 28:06.580
you wear it,
you return it to us,

28:06.580 --> 28:08.920

something new.

because they're all expensive

28:31.000 --> 28:33.740
and they all require
a special focus.

28:33.740 --> 28:35.540

the ability to pull

guac, and pico.

32:45.660 --> 32:46.890
That's all healthy.

32:46.890 --> 32:48.260
Herjavec: Fries are great!
I have regular potatoes.

32:48.260 --> 32:49.630
Oh, you have the Carolina.

32:49.630 --> 32:50.730
That is pulled pork.

32:50.730 --> 32:52.430
Pulled pork!
Mmm!

32:52.430 --> 32:54.230
I've got to get through --
there's four sauces.

32:54.230 --> 32:55.470
There's four
different sauces.

32:55.470 --> 32:56.970
So, we have a special one
called Buena Sauce.

32:56.970 --> 32:58.570
It's our house made.
It's mayo.

32:58.570 --> 33:00.840
It's garlicky, cilantro,
delicious.

33:00.840 --> 33:02.910
I just had it. It's delicious.
Oh, I like that.

33:02.910 --> 33:03.980
Sweet potato fries are
really good.

33:03.980 --> 33:04.910
Awesome.

33:04.910 --> 33:05.810
Well, I'm going
to give you

33:05.810 --> 33:07.510
an "Y Chihuahua,
caramba!"

33:07.510 --> 33:08.350
Ohh! Ooh!

33:08.350 --> 33:09.180
It's pretty good.

33:09.180 --> 33:10.480
Muchas gracias.

33:10.480 --> 33:12.690
People have fell in love
with this since we opened.
Yes.

33:12.690 --> 33:14.750
It's been a crazy,
amazing ride.

33:14.750 --> 33:18.230
When we first opened up,
we had $18 in our bank account

33:18.230 --> 33:19.630
because we invested
everything.
Wow.

33:19.630 --> 33:21.130
$18?
$18.

33:21.130 --> 33:23.830
Because we had invested
our life savings.

33:23.830 --> 33:25.330
We had $40,000 saved.
Wow.

33:25.330 --> 33:27.770
And this company actually
started in the pandemic.

33:27.770 --> 33:30.900
This idea just came to mind.
We thought about Latin food.

33:30.900 --> 33:32.810
When you kind of go on vacation,
you're in Cancún

33:32.810 --> 33:35.140
or San Juan, Puerto Rico,
all those different street foods

33:35.140 --> 33:37.140
that you have there
and how good it tastes,

33:37.140 --> 33:38.610
and how can we bring it
back to America

33:38.610 --> 33:40.680
and adopt it
on top of these fries, right?

33:40.680 --> 33:42.880
So we served the family.
They were our test dummies.

33:42.880 --> 33:45.020
[ Laughter ]
They loved it.
The kids loved it.

33:45.020 --> 33:46.590
And they said, "Hey, Dad,
can we have some more?"

33:46.590 --> 33:48.620
And I was like, "You know what?
I may have a business here."

33:48.620 --> 33:50.890
So, we opened up
July 2021.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

33:50.890 --> 33:52.030
Where did you open?

33:52.030 --> 33:54.060
In Raleigh, North Carolina.
After that $18,

33:54.060 --> 33:56.360
two weeks later, we had
$18,000 in our bank account.

33:56.360 --> 33:58.630
Two weeks after that,
on TikTok, we went viral.

33:58.630 --> 34:00.870
An influencer came and tried
all of our dishes,

34:00.870 --> 34:03.000
and in two days,
we had 16 million views.
Mm-hmm.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.270
Wow.
16 million?

34:04.270 --> 34:05.240
16 million.
Wow.

34:05.240 --> 34:06.470
And when I saw people
just coming

34:06.470 --> 34:07.570
and eating those potatoes,

34:07.570 --> 34:09.740
I said, "Oh, my God,
it's working."

34:09.740 --> 34:11.040
So, tell us
about your background.

34:11.040 --> 34:12.580
How did you guys meet?

34:12.580 --> 34:14.710
Sure. We're actually
high school sweethearts.

34:14.710 --> 34:15.920
Really?
What?
Greiner: You are?

34:15.920 --> 34:17.720
Yeah. We met the last two weeks
of high school.

34:17.720 --> 34:18.920
Yeah.
And I pursued her

34:18.920 --> 34:20.090
like nothing other.

34:20.090 --> 34:21.390
Aww,
there's a prom photo.

34:21.390 --> 34:22.890
Herjavec:
Aww, look at that.
Aww.

34:22.890 --> 34:24.460
[ Johanna laughs ]
That's us. Yeah.

34:24.460 --> 34:26.490
And ever since then, we've been
building with each other.
Mm-hmm.

34:26.490 --> 34:28.300
Anybody got
restaurant experience?

34:28.300 --> 34:29.500
Not restaurant experience.

34:29.500 --> 34:30.760
So, I've been an entrepreneur
all my life.

34:30.760 --> 34:33.300
I started out actually working
for Queen Latifah

34:33.300 --> 34:34.700
at Flavor Unit
Entertainment.

34:34.700 --> 34:37.470
And at that time,
the "Latin boom" was going on.

34:37.470 --> 34:40.810
So I pitched, how about we do
a Latin management agency?

34:40.810 --> 34:43.580
No one's really, like, focusing
on these new Latin stars.

34:43.580 --> 34:46.110
And I've kind of always been
into the Latin culture.

34:46.110 --> 34:47.750
Johanna, we haven't
heard from you at all.

34:47.750 --> 34:49.620
I'm sorry. I talk a lot. Sorry.
Oh, wow, um...

34:49.620 --> 34:50.880
Okay.
You do talk a lot.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.620
I do. I do. I know this.
I know this.
[ Laughter ]

34:52.620 --> 34:53.750
Um, well,

34:53.750 --> 34:55.920
my family emigrated from
Colombia, South America,

34:55.920 --> 34:58.260
in the late 1980s.

34:58.260 --> 35:01.930
And when I went to school,
nobody could understand me.

35:01.930 --> 35:05.070
I ended up being placed
in the back of the class.
In the back of the class.

35:05.070 --> 35:07.030
I eventually learned
how to speak English.

35:07.030 --> 35:08.840
Right? Yay!

35:08.840 --> 35:10.370
I was the first one

35:10.370 --> 35:12.610
to graduate from college,
from my family.

35:12.610 --> 35:14.510
And then I went back
to the school

35:14.510 --> 35:16.680
where they sat me
in the back of the class.

35:16.680 --> 35:19.180
And I worked as a teacher
for 12 years.

35:19.180 --> 35:20.780
I love it!
Oh, teaching
at the same school.

35:20.780 --> 35:21.820
Good for you.
That's awesome.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.820
That's awesome.
Talk about triumphing.

35:23.820 --> 35:26.150
O'Leary: Okay, so,
talk about this product.

35:26.150 --> 35:27.220
Yes, sir.
Yeah.

35:27.220 --> 35:28.790
Tell me about
the cost of making it

35:28.790 --> 35:30.790
and what you sell it for
and what the margins are.

35:30.790 --> 35:32.060
Sure.
And your margins.

35:32.060 --> 35:34.160
So, on average,
to make any of these dishes,

35:34.160 --> 35:35.760
it ranges about
$3.50 per plate cost.

35:35.760 --> 35:36.930
And what do
you sell it for?

35:36.930 --> 35:38.430
On average, $13.50.

35:38.430 --> 35:39.730
What's your overall margin?

35:39.730 --> 35:41.300
Our food margins
are 28%.

35:41.300 --> 35:42.300
O'Leary: 28%?
Wow.

35:42.300 --> 35:44.100
James: 28%.
It's a little light.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.810
Is that your
net profit margins or --

35:45.810 --> 35:48.740
That's the -- On average,
that's where it's at, 28%,

35:48.740 --> 35:49.810
for our food costs.

35:49.810 --> 35:51.210
Oh, no.
So you're saying cost of,

35:51.210 --> 35:52.950
not your margins, right?

35:52.950 --> 35:54.310
Yeah. Not margins.
Not margins.
You're doing
the other way around.

35:54.310 --> 35:56.020
Yeah.
His margins are 72%.

35:56.020 --> 35:58.280
Okay. Well, then you're okay.
You're in good shape.

35:58.280 --> 36:00.820
Today, are you
in stores like this?

36:00.820 --> 36:02.360
James: So,
that's our first store,

36:02.360 --> 36:04.260
and it's a 200-square-feet
footprint.

36:04.260 --> 36:05.390
Yeah, I love that.

36:05.390 --> 36:07.530
Our first year,
we did $1.1 million.

36:07.530 --> 36:08.860
Whoa.
Greiner: Wow.

36:08.860 --> 36:10.030
We took all the profits
from that

36:10.030 --> 36:11.260
and invested
into this store.
Mm-hmm.

36:11.260 --> 36:12.370
Herjavec:
How big is that one?

36:12.370 --> 36:13.530
That one is
several hundred square feet.

36:13.530 --> 36:14.670
And how's that doing?

36:14.670 --> 36:16.540
It's doing really well.
So, combined, this year,

36:16.540 --> 36:18.810
we're going to finish
at about $2 million.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.740
What did you make last year
on the $2 million?

36:20.740 --> 36:22.210
About $200,000.

36:22.210 --> 36:23.710
Did you pay yourselves?
After paying...?

36:23.710 --> 36:26.050
We paid ourselves $80,000.
So that's, what, 1--

36:26.050 --> 36:27.710
$120,000.
$120,000. Mm-hmm.

36:27.710 --> 36:28.950
So you have two stores?

36:28.950 --> 36:30.450
Well, no, no.
Well, we have three stores.

36:30.450 --> 36:32.950
The third one is at an arena,
actually.

36:32.950 --> 36:35.560
We're opening up a fourth one
in Miami this month.

36:35.560 --> 36:36.390
Where in Miami?

36:36.390 --> 36:37.460
Wynwood, Miami.

36:37.460 --> 36:39.090
Oh, you'll kill it.
Yeah, we're excited.

36:39.090 --> 36:40.460
We also -- I didn't
mention this.

36:40.460 --> 36:41.930
So, we started
franchising.

36:41.930 --> 36:43.100
Ah.
Okay?

36:43.100 --> 36:44.960
And on our opening month of
our franchising program,

36:44.960 --> 36:46.030
we sold four franchises.

36:46.030 --> 36:47.430
Herjavec: What do you
charge for those?

36:47.430 --> 36:49.870
$29,500 for initial
franchise fee.

36:49.870 --> 36:51.470
And then how much
per year?

36:51.470 --> 36:54.710
8% royalty fee.
2% of that is marketing.

36:54.710 --> 36:57.180
And how long has the longest one
been out there? Is this new?

36:57.180 --> 36:58.080
Well, this is brand new.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.150
Brand new. Okay.
Brand new.

36:59.150 --> 37:00.380
So, we just sold
these franchises.

37:00.380 --> 37:02.380
So, what are you looking for?
We're looking for --

37:02.380 --> 37:03.820
Besides $400,000.

37:03.820 --> 37:06.420
Well, a strategic partnership
to help us build this brand.

37:06.420 --> 37:07.590
All right?
We got franchises selling.

37:07.590 --> 37:08.920
We're excited about those.

37:08.920 --> 37:12.630
We know we can move this company
along at a nice, snail pace.

37:12.630 --> 37:15.200
It doesn't sound
like a snail pace to me.
Herjavec: Yeah, no.

37:15.200 --> 37:16.100
I'll tell you
the hiccup, though.

37:16.100 --> 37:17.330
We're a young company,

37:17.330 --> 37:18.530
so when we go to banks
and we walk in,

37:18.530 --> 37:19.830
and we're looking nice
and pretty and are like,

37:19.830 --> 37:21.770
"Yeah, so we need some money
to open up a new store."

37:21.770 --> 37:23.770
And they're like, "No, you're
still considered a startup."

37:23.770 --> 37:25.410
So that was the issue.
So, we've been taking

37:25.410 --> 37:27.410
our own profits
and opening up these stores,

37:27.410 --> 37:29.240
which, I've learned now,
that is not healthy.

37:29.240 --> 37:30.440
Why is that
not healthy?

37:30.440 --> 37:32.450
Because we're sucking up
all the cash flow.

37:32.450 --> 37:33.950
But do you have
any debt today?

37:33.950 --> 37:36.720
$70,000 of debt on the business.
Nothing huge, right?

37:36.720 --> 37:38.650
Okay, but I think
it's a fundamental question.

37:38.650 --> 37:40.850
Like, would you rather grow
with a lot of debt

37:40.850 --> 37:42.620
and scale and maybe not
make a profit,

37:42.620 --> 37:44.260
or do it the way
you're doing it?

37:44.260 --> 37:48.090
You started this when you
only had $18 in your account,

37:48.090 --> 37:50.800
and now you're running
a $2 million business.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.570
I mean, you should be
so proud of that.

37:52.570 --> 37:53.930
Thank you. Thank you.
Johanna: Thank you.

37:53.930 --> 37:56.940
But the issue is we want to
have more speed, because I know

37:56.940 --> 37:58.740
that somebody else is going
to come into this market.

37:58.740 --> 38:01.040
Listen, I think you're
doing everything right.

38:01.040 --> 38:04.140
I think when you race and run
with something like this,

38:04.140 --> 38:06.480
where you have to make sure
you land in the right places,

38:06.480 --> 38:08.380
that you do
everything correctly...

38:08.380 --> 38:09.750
Right.
...it's not like you have to

38:09.750 --> 38:11.420
blitz the market
with it fast.

38:11.420 --> 38:13.450
People can't copy that.

38:13.450 --> 38:15.990
I would not want to
speed it out there,

38:15.990 --> 38:17.460
I would not
want to race it.

38:17.460 --> 38:19.460
I wish you good luck,
but I'm out.

38:19.460 --> 38:21.390
Thank you so much, Lori.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Lori.

38:21.390 --> 38:25.130
So, the five-year plan for us
is to open one corporate store

38:25.130 --> 38:26.770
every year
in the next five years,

38:26.770 --> 38:28.000
and that's going to end up,

38:28.000 --> 38:29.900
at the end of five years,
at $10 million.

38:29.900 --> 38:31.500
Cuban: So, guys.
Mm-hmm?

38:31.500 --> 38:33.570
Running a restaurant
is a hard business.

38:33.570 --> 38:36.280
Once you franchise,
you're in a second business,

38:36.280 --> 38:37.880
you're in the babysitting
business,

38:37.880 --> 38:39.350
you're in
the daycare business.
Mm, so true.

38:39.350 --> 38:42.720
Yeah.
Because you're taking
$29,500 from somebody

38:42.720 --> 38:44.350
and they're buying
your
dream.

38:44.350 --> 38:47.520
Mm.
And when they want your help,
you better be there.

38:47.520 --> 38:49.490
Mm-hmm.
If you guys were just in this,

38:49.490 --> 38:50.560
I was interested,

38:50.560 --> 38:51.790
but you're in
two different businesses.

38:51.790 --> 38:53.160
I think that's
going to crush you.

38:53.160 --> 38:54.790
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

38:54.790 --> 38:56.660
Ah, wow. Wow. Okay.
Thank you, Mark.

38:56.660 --> 38:59.700
So, very impressive.
It's delicious.

38:59.700 --> 39:03.500
But, frankly, with the change
of my lifestyle of eating,

39:03.500 --> 39:05.040
I wouldn't eat this.

39:05.040 --> 39:08.370
And I like to get behind
the products that I invest in

39:08.370 --> 39:10.480
so I can use my face
to push the business.

39:10.480 --> 39:11.680
Right. Right.
You know?

39:11.680 --> 39:13.850
I'm out.

39:13.850 --> 39:16.480
You know what I think? I think
you don't really need anybody.

39:16.480 --> 39:17.820
I think you have
the whole package,

39:17.820 --> 39:20.150
you have each other,
you're progressing nicely,

39:20.150 --> 39:23.060
and I think you'll continue
that way, so I'm out.

39:23.060 --> 39:24.490
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Barbara.

39:24.490 --> 39:26.560
