WEBVTT

00:09.802 --> 00:12.136
This is
a really nice room.

00:12.262 --> 00:14.263
Yeah, it sounds thick.
Too bad he's not coming.

00:14.390 --> 00:16.808
Look, I talked to him myself.
He'll be here.

00:16.934 --> 00:17.767
Right.

00:17.893 --> 00:19.977
You're the one who said
that the song could use a horn part,

00:20.229 --> 00:23.022
- so I got the best, John Henry.
- You think I'm stupid?

00:23.148 --> 00:25.149
Of course I do,
but that's not the point.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.110
He'll be here, okay?

00:35.577 --> 00:36.953
Take a left up ahead.

00:37.079 --> 00:40.206
South Street?
I canceled this gig.

00:40.457 --> 00:43.084
You said you didn't want to do
any sessions for a while.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.878
For a while.
I called her. I un-canceled it.

00:46.630 --> 00:49.632
- Are you up to it?
- Let's find out.

00:53.095 --> 00:54.095
You lied to me

00:54.221 --> 00:58.015
John Henry's
never gonna show up

00:58.142 --> 00:59.183
Will you stop?

00:59.309 --> 01:02.061
- It's been, like, two hours.
- And we will keep waiting.

01:02.187 --> 01:04.397
I mean, you've heard this guy play,
and you know what he does,

01:04.523 --> 01:06.023
so can you just
shut up, Tommy?

01:08.861 --> 01:10.069
Oh, my God.

01:11.488 --> 01:12.864
Am I late?

01:22.249 --> 01:25.251
- You need to hear it again?
- Nope. I get it.

01:25.419 --> 01:28.546
Let's try one. See what we get.
Let's do it.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.664
John, you okay?

02:04.750 --> 02:07.335
- You okay?
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

02:08.962 --> 02:12.215
Call an ambulance!
Now!

03:00.180 --> 03:01.430
I want in.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.560
John Henry Giles,
you a fan of his music?

03:05.686 --> 03:07.228
He's a musician?

03:08.146 --> 03:10.857
That paralysis thing,
guy can't walk for two years,

03:10.983 --> 03:13.401
nobody knows why,
it seems mildly interesting.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.944
Forget his paralysis.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.654
Tell that to the rest
of his bowling team.

03:17.114 --> 03:18.781
As far as this
hospital is concerned,

03:18.907 --> 03:21.158
this is a simple case
of lobar pneumonia. Boring.

03:21.285 --> 03:24.787
But that not-walking thing.
That could turn into something serious.

03:24.913 --> 03:28.124
Marty Hamilton is his primary physician
out in California.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.417
He's dealing
with the paralysis.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.336
Know all about it.
Multiple treatments, multiple surgeries.

03:32.462 --> 03:33.796
He's making real progress.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.089
Fixed everything
but the legs.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.425
Dr. Hamilton already called
and asked for your team.

03:37.676 --> 03:41.137
And by team,
I don't mean you.

03:41.263 --> 03:43.764
Like I always say,
there's no "I" in team.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.808
There is a "me" though,
if you jumble it up.

03:47.019 --> 03:48.978
Foreman did his
residency with Hamilton.

03:49.104 --> 03:52.690
I know. I accidentally glanced
at his resume before I hired him.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.275
He wants someone
he can trust.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.235
He must've spoken to
Foreman's parole officer.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.946
Someone who will stick
to the pneumonia.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.158
John Henry's on an experimental
protocol for the paralysis.

04:02.284 --> 04:04.410
I respect that.
I'm not going to get in his way.

04:04.536 --> 04:08.456
- It's Foreman's case.
- It's pneumonia. He can handle it.

04:08.582 --> 04:11.292
The guy's already paralyzed.
How badly can he screw it up?

04:28.018 --> 04:30.019
So, what are his sats?

04:30.145 --> 04:31.938
Staying in the 90s
on the nasal cannula.

04:32.064 --> 04:32.939
Coughing up
much sputum?

04:33.065 --> 04:34.815
Almost none.
He seems to be stabilized.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.525
Dr. House,
is anything back from micro?

04:36.652 --> 04:39.111
Not yet. You gonna fire me?

04:39.237 --> 04:40.821
You can make up for it
by washing my car.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.490
Oh, this is fun.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.825
Okay. Let's keep him
on the broad-spectrum antibiotics.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.119
And since he's displaying
septic physiology,

04:47.245 --> 04:50.247
draw blood for adrenal
and thyroid function.

04:52.209 --> 04:53.834
What about the paralysis?

04:53.961 --> 04:55.086
We're sticking
to the pneumonia.

04:55.212 --> 04:58.881
Well, you certainly are, boss,
like a wet tongue sticks to dry ice.

04:59.007 --> 05:02.301
The paralysis has already been
diagnosed by Dr. Hamilton. It's ALS.

05:02.427 --> 05:05.304
Lou Gehrig's disease.
It's a lovely diagnosis.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.681
They make movies about it.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.809
No tests, no treatment,
it's a disease of exclusion.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.894
Because Hamilton has
excluded everything else.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.187
I haven't.

05:17.776 --> 05:18.693
What else could it be?

05:19.611 --> 05:21.529
Guillain-Barre,
which would be reversible.

05:21.655 --> 05:22.655
Excellent.

05:22.781 --> 05:27.034
No. The progression of the paralysis
would be symmetric. This wasn't.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.119
Transverse myelitis.

05:28.245 --> 05:29.412
Hamilton tested for it.
Negative.

05:29.538 --> 05:31.247
And he was negative
for masses and AVM.

05:31.373 --> 05:32.915
Antibodies could be
attacking the nerves.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.291
Multifocal motor
neuropathy.

05:34.418 --> 05:37.461
Uncommon, but it fits.
It's also treatable.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.547
Did Hamilton try
putting the guy on IVIg?

05:39.673 --> 05:41.048
No, because
the MRI showed no...

05:41.174 --> 05:43.217
Well, let's do
an MRI of our own.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.806
Guys, it's my case.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.935
ALS fits. It even
predicts the pneumonia.

05:53.395 --> 05:56.605
- The paralysis is progressive.
- It's a death sentence.

05:57.441 --> 05:59.275
That doesn't make it wrong.

06:17.753 --> 06:20.838
So you think the breathing stuff
is connected to my ALS?

06:20.964 --> 06:22.506
It makes sense.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.594
So it's just
gonna get worse, huh?

06:26.720 --> 06:28.763
- Well, Dr. Hamilton...
- Great guy.

06:28.889 --> 06:32.516
Really smart doctor, and his treatment
obviously isn't working.

06:34.603 --> 06:35.936
Do you think
I'm going to die here,

06:36.063 --> 06:38.522
or you think I get to
go back home first?

06:38.648 --> 06:40.274
An MRI would give
us a better idea...

06:40.400 --> 06:42.651
An MRI, come on.
For pneumonia?

06:42.778 --> 06:44.111
Well, Dr. House thinks
we should test for...

06:44.237 --> 06:46.947
House?
Yeah, I heard about him.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.032
Obsessive son of a bitch?

06:48.158 --> 06:49.533
That's him.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.830
So who do you think is right,
Hamilton or House?

06:54.956 --> 06:57.333
Hey, they're both
excellent physicians.

06:57.459 --> 06:58.918
Come on.

06:59.044 --> 07:03.380
One of them says ALS.
The other one says not ALS.

07:03.507 --> 07:05.508
You got to pick one, son.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.969
Everything points to ALS.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.347
Then no MRI.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.937
And I want one of them
papers that say

07:18.063 --> 07:20.106
I don't want nothing done
if something go bad.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.108
A DNR?

07:22.567 --> 07:24.026
Mr. Giles, you don't
want to rush into...

07:24.152 --> 07:28.114
It's been two years. I ain't rushing.
I want to sign one.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.242
Now.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.037
While my arm still works.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.689
He signed a DNR.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.027
He rhymes with dinner?

08:07.946 --> 08:12.366
- He signed a DNR.
- Oh. That makes more sense.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.911
You tell him
it might not be ALS?

08:16.037 --> 08:17.204
No.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.166
Well, no wonder he signed.
Who wouldn't?

08:20.292 --> 08:22.877
I started him
on IV steroids and Synthroid.

08:23.003 --> 08:27.756
Great. If it was my case,
I'd be adding a little IVIg to the mix.

08:27.883 --> 08:29.341
For his pneumonia?

08:29.467 --> 08:31.260
That's my story,
and I'm sticking to it.

08:32.888 --> 08:35.806
He doesn't want anything done,
no treatment.

08:36.016 --> 08:39.602
DNR means "do not resuscitate",
not "do not treat".

08:40.854 --> 08:44.315
You do nothing,
doesn't matter which one of us is right.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.527
And hang on to that DNR.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.071
That signature could be worth
a lot of money real soon.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.874
This is Dr. Foreman.
What's Mr. Giles's status?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.919
Okay. Increase the steroids
to 100 milligrams every 12 hours

09:05.045 --> 09:08.505
and start him on IVIg.

09:08.632 --> 09:11.091
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
One gram per kilo.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.346
My nature isn't
what it used to be.

09:15.472 --> 09:18.098
The little man has lost
some bounce in his step.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.602
He needs to crank it up,
have himself some fun this weekend.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.312
He wants the blue pills.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.690
You're talking about your penis
in the third person.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.902
- Me and him, two people.
- Separate vacations?

09:30.445 --> 09:33.822
That'd be a drag for one of you.
I don't think you need the pills.

09:33.949 --> 09:35.950
I think you have
a conflict in medications.

09:36.201 --> 09:39.370
You need to up your insulin
to chocolate-chip ice-cream levels.

09:39.955 --> 09:42.039
- Insulin?
- Yeah, you remember.

09:42.165 --> 09:43.832
That's the stuff
you take for the diabetes

09:43.959 --> 09:45.960
that you forgot to
tell the nurse about.

09:46.544 --> 09:47.461
Your hands.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.632
No hair,
which means nerve damage.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.051
And your shoes look
about two sizes too small,

09:54.177 --> 09:56.595
which means you've lost
sensation in your feet.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.514
And then there's your pants.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.266
My pants tell you
I have diabetes?

10:00.392 --> 10:01.684
No. They tell me
you're an idiot.

10:02.394 --> 10:05.354
Powdered sugar
on the right pant leg.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.314
Based on the two napkins
in your pocket,

10:07.524 --> 10:10.109
I'd be willing to bet
it's not your first donut of the day.

10:18.743 --> 10:22.204
- You're giving me the pills?
- Sure. Why not?

10:22.372 --> 10:26.667
If you've got heart disease from
ignoring the diabetes, they'll kill you.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.211
Otherwise, you two
have a fun weekend.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.514
- O2 sats are dropping.
- Breath sounds?

10:40.640 --> 10:41.598
Junky.

10:41.725 --> 10:44.852
- Mucus plug?
- Our mistake. Sludging from the IVIg.

10:44.978 --> 10:45.978
Blood can't get
through to his lungs.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.563
Start heparin,
500 ccs IV push.

10:47.689 --> 10:49.148
He won't last long
enough for it to work.

10:49.274 --> 10:50.858
We've got to
intubate him stat.

10:51.568 --> 10:55.029
- We can't. He's DNR.
- What?

11:03.455 --> 11:06.373
- Someone likes music.
- Oh, yeah.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.923
His sats are in the 70s.
How long's he been like this?

11:15.050 --> 11:16.300
- Ten minutes.
- Well, why aren't you...

11:16.426 --> 11:18.218
The IVIg put him
in respiratory failure.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.511
You put him on IVIg?

11:19.637 --> 11:22.848
- We did this.
- So undo it. Chase?

11:22.974 --> 11:24.099
It's too late.
We killed him.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.185
Nobody killed him.
He's not dead.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.687
- Chase, intubate him.
- He's DNR.

11:39.991 --> 11:41.367
What are you doing?

11:46.915 --> 11:48.540
You can't do this!

11:50.377 --> 11:52.836
- Bag.
- You can't do this.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.296
Bag!

12:02.389 --> 12:06.058
He had a bad reaction
to some medicine we gave him.

12:06.267 --> 12:10.562
- What did you just do?
- He saved his life.

12:25.954 --> 12:28.664
He's stable on the ventilator,
oxygenating well.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.541
The IVIg made him worse,

12:30.667 --> 12:34.086
which means multifocal motor
neuropathy was a bad diagnosis.

12:34.212 --> 12:35.671
Okay, what's
really wrong with him?

12:35.797 --> 12:36.964
What's wrong with you?

12:37.090 --> 12:38.173
Everyone knows
what's wrong with me.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.967
What's wrong with him
is much more interesting.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.219
You tubed him,
and he didn't want to be tubed.

12:42.345 --> 12:44.346
He has a legal paper
saying just that.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.641
To intubate or not to intubate,
that is the big ethical question.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.143
Actually, I was hoping
we could avoid it,

12:49.269 --> 12:50.352
maybe just
practice some medicine.

12:50.478 --> 12:53.272
There is no question.
It's the patient's decision.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.315
If the patient is
competent to make it.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.818
If his thyroid numbers
aren't making him sad.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.069
Oh, my God.
You don't believe that.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.571
His thyroid levels
were a little...

13:00.697 --> 13:03.157
It's nothing.
Do not defend him!

13:03.283 --> 13:05.117
Why did he sign that DNR?

13:05.243 --> 13:06.076
I didn't talk him into...

13:06.202 --> 13:08.078
No. He signed
the DNR 'cause he didn't

13:08.204 --> 13:10.080
want a slow,
painful death from ALS.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.999
What was happening to him
had nothing to do with his ALS.

13:12.125 --> 13:15.627
Right, exactly! It's the IVIg.
You screwed up!

13:15.753 --> 13:18.046
You're not going to let him die
because you screwed up.

13:19.215 --> 13:22.593
Technically, your case,
you screwed up.

13:22.719 --> 13:25.596
Is that what this is about,
looking bad in front of your old boss?

13:25.722 --> 13:27.139
You assaulted that man.

13:27.265 --> 13:29.183
- Fine, I'll never do it again.
- Yes, you will.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.602
All the more reason
this debate is pointless.

13:37.108 --> 13:40.194
His lungs are worse.
Any theories?

13:41.279 --> 13:44.490
Oh, I'm sure he just went to the
little boys' room. Come on, people.

13:45.533 --> 13:46.492
Vasculitis?

13:46.618 --> 13:48.118
Wouldn't likely
hit both lungs.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.787
It could be
Wegener's granulomatosis.

13:50.914 --> 13:52.080
Dr. House?

13:54.709 --> 13:57.127
Cuddy sent me
a stripper again?

13:57.253 --> 13:59.046
Love that woman,
so thoughtful.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.049
Sorry.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.884
There are case
reports of Wegener's

14:04.010 --> 14:05.177
hitting both
the lungs and the spine.

14:05.303 --> 14:08.597
Well, it's not great, but it's better
than ALS. At least it's treatable.

14:08.723 --> 14:09.890
It's a restraining order.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.142
You're not to come within 50 feet
of John Henry Giles,

14:12.268 --> 14:16.104
and they've asked the D.A.
to file criminal charges for battery.

14:17.899 --> 14:22.152
- Cameron, test the blood for c-ANCA.
- These are criminal charges.

14:22.278 --> 14:24.321
They're not going to let you
take blood to make more tests.

14:24.447 --> 14:25.948
He has blood left
in the lab.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.282
Just add on the c-ANCA.

14:27.408 --> 14:30.202
Foreman got you doing bronchoscopic
suctioning for the pneumonia?

14:30.328 --> 14:31.161
Every four hours.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.622
Well, while you're down in his lungs,
grab a biopsy.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.958
We'll need it to
confirm Wegener's.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.834
And move the patient
to the second-floor ICU.

14:37.961 --> 14:40.087
- Why?
- It's right above the clinic.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.256
I'm pretty sure it's
50 feet in any direction.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.260
It's nice having a court order saying
you don't have to work clinic duty.

15:03.361 --> 15:04.987
Dr. Cuddy!

15:05.446 --> 15:06.738
Excuse me.

15:08.074 --> 15:10.325
- You paged me.
- Why the yelling?

15:10.618 --> 15:14.246
His bed is behind that wall,
the plaintiff's.

15:14.372 --> 15:16.999
I can't, you know,
come any closer.

15:18.209 --> 15:20.127
It's right over the clinic.
Very cute.

15:20.253 --> 15:23.338
Can we get the lecture over with
'cause I've got to...

15:24.299 --> 15:26.842
Actually, I've got nothing to do.
Take your time.

15:27.343 --> 15:28.510
You need a lawyer?

15:29.554 --> 15:31.972
You don't have
a problem with what I did?

15:32.098 --> 15:34.516
When I hired you,
I knew you were insane.

15:34.642 --> 15:38.020
I will continue to try and stop you
from doing insane things,

15:38.146 --> 15:42.149
but once they're done,
trying to convince an insane person

15:42.275 --> 15:45.152
not to do insane things is,
in itself, insane,

15:45.278 --> 15:49.531
so when I hired you, I also set aside
$50,000 a year for legal expenses.

15:50.742 --> 15:53.285
So far, you've come in
under-budget.

15:53.411 --> 15:57.122
Great. Any chance you could
help me run some tests?

15:58.166 --> 16:02.669
Dr. Foreman called Dr. Hamilton.
He's flying in from LA.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.504
You can talk to him.

16:04.631 --> 16:10.260
Dr. Hamilton is flying in as a friend
of John Henry's to pull the plug.

16:14.891 --> 16:17.559
Yeah. I need a lawyer.

16:22.899 --> 16:25.108
Your Honor,
on behalf of Gregory House,

16:25.234 --> 16:27.611
we have convened
an emergency session of this court

16:27.737 --> 16:32.032
to bring a motion requesting that
John Henry Giles remain on life support.

16:32.158 --> 16:38.580
Mr. House faces criminal charges
for battery against John Henry Giles.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.667
You beat up a guy
in a wheelchair?

16:41.793 --> 16:45.087
Dr. House is alleged
to have forced a tube

16:45.213 --> 16:48.048
down Mr. Giles's throat
against his will.

16:48.299 --> 16:50.884
A medical tube,
saving his life.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.221
Dr. House, please let
your attorney speak for you.

16:56.641 --> 16:58.892
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
I was way out of line.

17:01.229 --> 17:05.190
So, your client forced
the patient into this position,

17:05.566 --> 17:10.529
and now he wants a court order
to force the patient to stay that way.

17:10.655 --> 17:14.324
Without the tube, there's a high
likelihood that Mr. Giles will die.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.744
Well, I assume the patient knows that.
He had a DNR.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.914
That's why your client is facing
criminal charges, right?

17:21.040 --> 17:23.709
Exactly.
And Mr. Giles's death

17:23.835 --> 17:26.670
will violate my client's
Sixth Amendment right.

17:26.963 --> 17:31.591
His right to face his accuser.
That's clever, huh?

17:31.718 --> 17:35.220
Your Honor, in Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania v. Hoselton,

17:35.346 --> 17:37.514
the Third District
ruled that a defendant

17:37.640 --> 17:39.725
may not use that status
to rule against a felony charge.

17:40.935 --> 17:43.061
Why are you doing this?
It's not gonna keep you out of jail.

17:43.187 --> 17:44.146
No.

17:44.272 --> 17:46.148
Even if you win,
the restraining order

17:46.274 --> 17:49.317
and battery charge stay in place,
so what have you gained?

17:49.444 --> 17:50.360
Time.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.238
To diagnose him?
You can't get near him.

17:53.364 --> 17:54.489
I don't want to
be near him.

17:55.450 --> 17:58.034
Well, some doctors have
the messiah complex.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.619
They need to
save the world.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.830
You've got
the Rubik's complex.

18:01.956 --> 18:03.123
You need to
solve the puzzle.

18:03.249 --> 18:07.127
Are you done, or do you have more
references to 1980s fads?

18:07.253 --> 18:08.253
I'm trying to
listen to this.

18:09.672 --> 18:11.715
That DNR
may not be valid.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.717
The patient was
suffering from depression,

18:13.843 --> 18:15.635
brought on by
a thyroid imbalance.

18:15.762 --> 18:22.309
The DNR order was witnessed
by Dr. House's own staff, Dr. Foreman.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.227
My staff are idiots.

18:24.353 --> 18:25.937
I'm sure you know
what it's like, Your Honor.

18:26.063 --> 18:27.522
Sit down.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.905
The validity
of the DNR is a question of fact.

18:35.031 --> 18:36.823
Dr. House should
have the opportunity

18:36.949 --> 18:38.909
to make his argument
at a full trial.

18:39.035 --> 18:40.911
And this poor guy
has got to stay

18:41.037 --> 18:43.747
on life support
until we can schedule a trial.

18:43.873 --> 18:44.873
Your Honor.

18:44.999 --> 18:45.957
Dr. House,

18:46.083 --> 18:50.212
I will hold you in contempt
if you don't sit down.

18:50.338 --> 18:51.505
I have a medical issue.

18:51.631 --> 18:52.923
If it pertains to this case,
your attorney...

18:53.049 --> 18:54.508
It doesn't.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.845
Do you have any history
of heart disease in your family?

18:58.971 --> 18:59.971
Your Honor!

19:00.097 --> 19:01.056
Your fingers.

19:01.182 --> 19:04.935
They show signs of clubbing,
which indicates a heart problem.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.895
Remember Bart Giamatti?

19:07.021 --> 19:08.897
Same thing,
just dropped dead one day.

19:09.023 --> 19:10.690
Please see your doctor.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.859
He's admitted
this isn't relevant.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.570
Can we get back
to the motion?

19:15.696 --> 19:17.531
Of course. I'm sorry.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.449
Your Honor,

19:19.575 --> 19:23.203
a person's right to control the
treatment of their own body

19:23.329 --> 19:26.081
is fundamental to
understanding this case.

19:26.207 --> 19:30.043
A long line of cases,
both federal and state, stand to...

19:30.711 --> 19:33.880
Congratulations.
Impressive legal argument.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.257
I watched Matlock
last night.

19:35.383 --> 19:36.591
Say no more.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.552
I didn't notice any clubbing
on the judge's fingers.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.095
Neither did I.

19:40.221 --> 19:42.097
So the family
history thing...

19:42.223 --> 19:44.808
Every family has some history
of heart disease.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.601
And mental illness.

19:50.064 --> 19:52.274
Biopsy only shows inflammation.

19:53.067 --> 19:54.651
Start him on Cytoxan.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.987
You're diagnosing Wegener's
based on a little inflammation?

19:57.363 --> 20:00.115
Well, unfortunately, I think we've
exhausted all the tests we can do

20:00.241 --> 20:03.118
in our capacity as the doctors
that he doesn't want doing tests on him.

20:03.244 --> 20:04.077
But you don't...

20:04.203 --> 20:05.120
We'll know I'm right
if he starts walking.

20:05.246 --> 20:07.622
We can't do any more tests,
but you want me to treat him?

20:07.748 --> 20:09.165
Medicine's in the pharmacy.

20:09.292 --> 20:11.042
Patient's immobilized
in the ICU.

20:11.168 --> 20:13.795
Sounds like
a simple geography problem.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.047
Are you asking us
to jeopardize

20:16.173 --> 20:18.091
our medical licenses
for this treatment?

20:44.201 --> 20:45.911
Can I help you?

20:47.121 --> 20:48.538
I'm Dr. House.

20:48.664 --> 20:51.124
Greg, right? I'm Marty Hamilton,
John Henry's doctor.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.795
We should talk.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.885
Appreciate any list of medications,
anything like that.

21:02.011 --> 21:04.012
I've started him on Cytoxan.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.015
For Wegener's, right?

21:07.141 --> 21:08.350
Look, Greg.

21:09.185 --> 21:11.311
I checked you out, you know?

21:11.437 --> 21:13.021
I know you're a good doctor,

21:13.147 --> 21:15.273
and you have to appreciate
that I'm a good doctor, too.

21:15.399 --> 21:16.524
Why?

21:16.651 --> 21:18.818
Wegener's is one of the first
things I looked for.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.279
The biopsy and the blood test
were negative, just like yours.

21:21.405 --> 21:23.823
There's an error rate, Marty.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.201
And there's
a time to let go.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.203
Look, I'm gonna take him
off the ventilator,

21:28.329 --> 21:30.038
and John Henry's
going to die.

21:30.164 --> 21:31.414
He's accepted that.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.666
Dr. Hamilton.

21:33.626 --> 21:34.876
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:35.002 --> 21:37.045
- Hey, how you doing?
- How you doing?

21:37.171 --> 21:38.672
Listen, Dr. Hamilton,
I'm sorry.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.006
I should have never
put your patient on IVIg.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.383
It's not your fault, Eric.

21:41.509 --> 21:44.177
No, it's mine, Eric.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.804
That's not what I said.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.263
Everybody asks
about you out in LA.

21:47.390 --> 21:48.890
How's
the old place doing?

21:49.016 --> 21:52.727
Oh, this is wonderful, but before
you guys break out the oil,

21:52.853 --> 21:54.145
I should point
out that you can't

21:54.271 --> 21:56.106
pull the plug.
I have a court order.

21:57.358 --> 21:58.692
You used to, but...

21:58.818 --> 22:01.403
I have the right to face my accuser.
Judge said so.

22:01.529 --> 22:03.238
Not if no one's
accusing you.

22:03.364 --> 22:05.240
All the charges
have been dropped.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.457
He doesn't have to die.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.170
It's not Wegener's.

22:34.228 --> 22:37.897
If it's Wegener's,
his lungs won't be able to handle it.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.525
Soon as they pull
that plug, he'll die.

22:40.651 --> 22:43.528
That's why they call it
"pulling the plug".

23:04.258 --> 23:06.217
I'm gonna miss you.

23:43.839 --> 23:46.883
- He's still breathing.
- His O2 sats are holding.

23:52.223 --> 23:55.183
- He's holding his own.
- He's still breathing.

23:56.477 --> 23:57.894
It's not Wegener's.

24:05.903 --> 24:07.195
Wrong again.

24:12.660 --> 24:15.453
He's stable,
but one of his arms is now paralyzed.

24:15.579 --> 24:18.665
The real question is,
why is he still alive?

24:18.791 --> 24:20.959
Do you think he's
just being stubborn?

24:21.085 --> 24:23.795
He's alive because you were wrong.
It's not Wegener's.

24:23.921 --> 24:25.922
Yeah. Seem to be
doing that a lot lately.

24:26.048 --> 24:28.007
People keep living
because of my mistakes.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.592
Progression of
the paralysis pretty much

24:29.718 --> 24:31.344
confirmed Hamilton was right.
It's ALS.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.680
Assuming this is a progression
of his paralysis.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.056
He can't move his arm.

24:35.182 --> 24:38.143
Yes, his arm is paralyzed.
Yes, his legs are paralyzed.

24:38.269 --> 24:41.855
Why is everyone so gung ho
to connect those two conditions?

24:41.981 --> 24:44.649
You can think I'm wrong,
but that's no reason to stop thinking.

24:44.775 --> 24:46.901
How about this one?
He's not our patient.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.570
Nope. Not good enough.

24:48.696 --> 24:50.989
He could've suffered a stroke
when he was intubated.

24:51.574 --> 24:53.616
Well, blood clots are common
in paralyzed patients.

24:53.742 --> 24:54.951
The inactivity causes...

24:55.077 --> 24:56.202
Not interested in why.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.997
Let's get an MR angiogram,
check for an embolic stroke.

24:59.123 --> 25:00.081
He doesn't want
you treating him.

25:00.207 --> 25:01.332
They dropped the court order.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.585
Yeah, and that girl dropped
the charges against Kobe,

25:03.711 --> 25:06.045
doesn't mean he should call her
and see if she's free to get a sundae.

25:06.172 --> 25:09.257
Good point. But I can go
within 50 feet of him now.

25:16.098 --> 25:17.974
If you need,
have them page me, anytime.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.142
Okay.

25:36.243 --> 25:37.994
Get out of here.

25:38.120 --> 25:42.790
Sure. That makes sense.
You hate me for saving your life.

25:43.125 --> 25:44.500
Well, in fairness
to your side,

25:44.627 --> 25:45.919
you were also dying
because of me, so...

25:46.045 --> 25:47.629
You knew I didn't
want to be saved.

25:47.755 --> 25:49.047
That's what's interesting.

25:49.173 --> 25:52.675
Your thyroid was low,
but not enough to cause depression.

25:53.093 --> 25:55.178
So you came here to tell me
that even if I can't walk,

25:55.304 --> 25:57.889
I can still hear
the birds sing,

25:58.015 --> 26:00.808
enjoy a rainbow,
the feeling of sunshine on my face.

26:02.269 --> 26:04.062
Those things are fun.

26:05.314 --> 26:07.148
Okay. Life sucks.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.360
Your life sucks
more than most.

26:10.486 --> 26:14.113
It's not as bad as some,
which is depressing all by itself,

26:15.324 --> 26:16.950
but do me a favor.

26:18.077 --> 26:21.037
Just let me find out
what's wrong with you.

26:21.413 --> 26:24.123
Then if you still
want to kill yourself,

26:26.877 --> 26:30.004
I'll give you a hand.
That sound fair?

26:30.130 --> 26:31.089
Yeah. Sure.

26:32.132 --> 26:35.093
I'll stick around
to indulge your obsession.

26:35.844 --> 26:38.221
It's over. I lost my air.

26:39.390 --> 26:41.099
The session the other night
with those kids,

26:41.225 --> 26:43.559
that was a test to see
if I could still play.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.228
I can't.

26:45.646 --> 26:48.189
And that's all
you are, a musician?

26:49.108 --> 26:54.904
- I got one thing, same as you.
- Really?

26:55.030 --> 26:57.907
Well, apparently,
you know me better than I know you.

26:58.033 --> 27:02.078
I know that limp.
I know the empty ring finger.

27:02.621 --> 27:06.207
And that obsessive nature of yours,
that's a big secret.

27:07.001 --> 27:09.168
You don't risk jail
and your career

27:09.295 --> 27:11.129
to save somebody
who doesn't want to be saved

27:11.255 --> 27:14.924
unless you got something,
anything, one thing.

27:15.843 --> 27:20.805
The reason normal people got wives
and kids and hobbies, whatever,

27:21.515 --> 27:24.058
that's because they ain't got
that one thing that,

27:24.184 --> 27:27.145
that hits them
that hard and that true.

27:27.271 --> 27:29.897
I got music. You got this.

27:30.024 --> 27:31.733
The thing you think about
all the time,

27:31.859 --> 27:33.901
thing that keeps
you south of normal.

27:34.153 --> 27:37.947
Yeah. Makes us great.
Makes us the best.

27:38.073 --> 27:40.616
All we miss out on
is everything else.

27:41.702 --> 27:45.455
Little woman waiting at home after work
with the drink and the kiss.

27:45.581 --> 27:50.460
- That ain't gonna happen for us.
- That's why God made microwaves.

27:51.253 --> 27:52.962
Yeah.

27:53.088 --> 27:57.967
But when it's over,
it's over.

28:02.973 --> 28:03.890
Yeah.

28:21.700 --> 28:22.909
What are you doing?

28:24.953 --> 28:26.204
It's not over for me.

28:26.330 --> 28:30.208
Either you're gonna call the cops again,
or we're doing this.

28:30.334 --> 28:33.836
You want to die, you can do it
just as easily inside an MRI machine.

28:38.717 --> 28:39.842
That's another nice place.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.010
Exactly.

28:42.346 --> 28:45.932
So when I go back to LA, I'm doing
the Dana lectures again this year.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.184
- Wow.
- Thank you.

28:48.310 --> 28:49.394
Thanks.
That's quite an honor.

28:49.520 --> 28:52.522
- It's all political.
- Don't be modest. You've earned it.

28:53.023 --> 28:55.108
I got lucky on
a couple studies I was doing.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.859
It all sells tickets.

28:56.985 --> 28:58.361
You remember last year's lectures,
don't you?

28:58.487 --> 29:00.363
I remember
the cigar bar afterwards.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.740
The only reason to attend the thing,
cigars and pool.

29:06.453 --> 29:08.246
You enjoy working with Dr. House?

29:10.541 --> 29:11.958
Not the word I'd use.

29:12.835 --> 29:16.087
We work too hard
not to enjoy ourselves, right?

29:17.631 --> 29:19.966
- You seeing anybody?
- Kind of, sort of.

29:20.092 --> 29:23.511
- Serious?
- I don't know. It could be.

29:23.637 --> 29:25.763
You think she'd enjoy LA?

29:43.824 --> 29:46.033
Hamilton offered me a job.

29:46.160 --> 29:48.286
- You gonna take it?
- I haven't decided.

29:48.412 --> 29:49.954
You already have
the most prestigious fellowship.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.706
It's a partnership.

29:51.832 --> 29:55.835
Three times the money, car allowance,
moving expense, pension plan,

29:55.961 --> 29:58.629
the chance to work for a guy who gives
a crap what other people think.

29:58.755 --> 30:00.923
So why didn't you
just tell him yes?

30:01.049 --> 30:03.926
- I made a commitment here.
- Right.

30:04.052 --> 30:06.053
House would let you out of it
in a heartbeat.

30:06.180 --> 30:07.889
Or he wouldn't,
just to jerk me around.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.516
Would you guys have
taken the job?

30:10.642 --> 30:11.601
Don't need the money.

30:11.727 --> 30:14.187
I'm not like you.
I don't hate House.

30:14.313 --> 30:17.148
You guys really don't have a problem
with him, with what he did?

30:17.274 --> 30:19.066
He knows we disagree
with his choice.

30:19.193 --> 30:21.444
Choice? Chase, it's not
apples and oranges.

30:21.570 --> 30:22.737
It's right and wrong.

30:22.863 --> 30:24.322
And he does it
like he doesn't care.

30:24.448 --> 30:26.073
He assaults
the guy and moves on

30:26.200 --> 30:27.325
to the next differential diagnosis
like it's...

30:27.451 --> 30:28.784
What do you
want from him?

30:28.911 --> 30:30.286
More hand-wringing,
more torment?

30:30.412 --> 30:31.954
You want him to cry himself
to sleep at night?

30:32.080 --> 30:35.374
Yeah! Yeah, I want some clue
that he knows it's a big deal.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.627
That it scares him,
that it matters.

30:37.753 --> 30:38.711
Whoa!

30:39.087 --> 30:40.213
What was that?

30:42.049 --> 30:43.466
It was a stroke.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.220
- Well done, Cameron.
- House called it.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.180
The arm and legs
are unrelated.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.058
You make enough calls,
one of them is bound to be right.

30:52.184 --> 30:55.228
Yeah. He's just
a lucky, lucky guy.

30:55.354 --> 31:00.191
Listen, listen. I just think it wouldn't
hurt him to learn a little humility.

31:00.776 --> 31:02.610
So what's the verdict?

31:03.445 --> 31:06.572
Embolus. The arm problem was
caused by a clot.

31:06.698 --> 31:09.242
There's a good chance
we can still bust the clot with tPA.

31:09.952 --> 31:12.620
Do it.
See what happens to his arm.

31:22.464 --> 31:25.049
We found a blood clot
in your brain.

31:25.175 --> 31:28.261
We'd like to start you on heparin.
It's a blood thinner.

31:28.387 --> 31:29.637
What are the side effects?

31:30.389 --> 31:33.140
Well, your lungs are kind of chewed up
from the pneumonia.

31:33.267 --> 31:34.767
Good chance
there'll be an effusion.

31:35.060 --> 31:37.645
- Bleeding?
- Into his lungs.

31:37.771 --> 31:40.273
It's our best chance
to give you back the use of your arm.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.066
I don't need my arm
without my air.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.026
The damage would
likely be minimal.

31:44.152 --> 31:45.528
No.

31:47.864 --> 31:49.282
It's his call.

31:51.493 --> 31:53.786
Or we could do
an embolectomy.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.997
Basically, we go in
and pull the clot out.

31:56.623 --> 32:00.167
He's saying no to drugs,
and you're recommending brain surgery?

32:00.294 --> 32:02.253
Bypasses the risk
to the lungs.

32:02.379 --> 32:03.462
It'll either help
your arm, or...

32:03.589 --> 32:05.047
It'll kill me.

32:05.173 --> 32:07.842
From your point of view,
it's a win-win.

32:09.553 --> 32:10.720
Okay.

32:11.346 --> 32:13.264
We'll set up
the procedure for today.

32:25.068 --> 32:27.528
We're in your carotid artery.

32:27.654 --> 32:31.407
This is gonna take us
all the way up into your brain.

32:31.533 --> 32:33.159
You all right?

32:33.827 --> 32:34.952
Yes.

32:42.127 --> 32:44.253
The sludge is
blocking the blood flow to

32:44.379 --> 32:46.756
the part of the brain
that controls your arm.

32:55.849 --> 32:58.601
All done. You still okay?

33:00.729 --> 33:01.896
I think so.

33:03.023 --> 33:04.732
I don't know.
I guess...

33:04.858 --> 33:06.442
It's just with
Dr. Hamilton here,

33:06.568 --> 33:08.653
I noticed a difference in styles.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.697
His style involves humility?

33:13.158 --> 33:15.242
Another difference
in our styles,

33:15.369 --> 33:18.454
I don't care much for apologies.
You can go.

33:18.580 --> 33:20.873
I didn't know you were standing there
when I said that, okay?

33:20.999 --> 33:22.291
It was completely rude.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.043
Do you mean genuine humility,

33:24.169 --> 33:26.754
you know, all the self-doubt
and the self-questioning,

33:26.880 --> 33:30.633
or Hamilton's polite, patronizing,
aw-shucks humility?

33:30.759 --> 33:31.801
You're both
excellent doctors.

33:31.927 --> 33:32.885
Thank you.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.845
And humility is
an important quality,

33:35.764 --> 33:37.139
especially if
you're wrong a lot.

33:37.265 --> 33:39.934
You've been wrong
every step of the way.

33:44.439 --> 33:49.443
'Course, when you're right, self-doubt
doesn't help anybody, does it?

33:55.867 --> 33:57.493
We got to go.

34:05.085 --> 34:06.377
Congratulations, Greg.

34:07.963 --> 34:10.673
Congratulations.
Why, Marty?

34:10.799 --> 34:13.050
John woke up.
He can use his arm.

34:13.969 --> 34:15.219
Thank you.

34:15.345 --> 34:17.138
Now, look, I know we've had
our differences,

34:17.264 --> 34:19.014
but I think when
a person does something well,

34:19.141 --> 34:21.183
it ought to
be recognized.

34:21.309 --> 34:23.018
The phone works.

34:23.145 --> 34:24.145
Next time
you want to make me feel

34:24.271 --> 34:25.938
all warm and fuzzy,
leave a message.

34:26.773 --> 34:29.108
Don't get me wrong.
I'm overcome with joy.

34:29.484 --> 34:30.985
- Doc.
- Yeah.

34:31.111 --> 34:34.071
- What?
- You just touched my leg.

34:34.906 --> 34:37.616
What, are you gonna charge me
with assault again?

34:37.743 --> 34:38.784
No.

34:39.995 --> 34:41.454
I felt it.

34:51.548 --> 34:53.966
He now has feeling
all the way up to the calf.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.927
This is the way
medicine evolved.

34:57.053 --> 34:58.721
Patients sometimes
get better.

34:58.847 --> 35:02.224
You have no idea why, but unless
you give a reason, they won't pay you.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.268
Anybody notice
if there's a full moon?

35:04.394 --> 35:06.395
You're saying he just
spontaneously got better?

35:06.521 --> 35:08.981
No, I'm saying let's rule out
the lunar god and go from there.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.108
Something he's on
is working.

35:11.234 --> 35:14.278
The enzyme replacement protocol
is working, reversing the ALS.

35:14.404 --> 35:16.739
The timing doesn't
seem suspicious to you?

35:16.865 --> 35:18.699
Do you think Dr. House
will see it that way,

35:18.825 --> 35:20.618
figure it's his medication
doing the job?

35:20.744 --> 35:22.161
I'm sure he will.

35:22.287 --> 35:23.412
It's one of ours.

35:23.538 --> 35:25.539
How do we figure out which drug
is doing the trick?

35:25.665 --> 35:27.792
Easy.
We just stop all of them.

35:27.918 --> 35:29.001
One of those drugs
is helping him.

35:29.127 --> 35:32.004
And the rest,
steroids, antibiotics,

35:32.130 --> 35:33.672
anti-inflammatories,
they're toxic.

35:33.799 --> 35:34.757
If we leave him
on all of them...

35:34.883 --> 35:35.841
He'll walk again.

35:35.967 --> 35:36.967
Yeah, to his own funeral.

35:37.093 --> 35:38.594
But if we stop everything,
he'll get worse.

35:38.720 --> 35:41.138
True. Then we'll add our medications
back one at a time.

35:41.264 --> 35:42.973
When he gets better,
then we'll have our answer.

35:43.099 --> 35:46.852
- And if he doesn't get better?
- Then we're in trouble.

35:46.978 --> 35:51.816
Not as much as he is,
but I suppose that was your point.

35:54.069 --> 35:56.028
I assume you want me
to convince Hamilton

35:56.154 --> 35:57.196
to stop his treatments, too.

35:57.322 --> 35:58.531
Don't care.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.325
You know at least five of the
medications are part of his protocol.

36:01.451 --> 36:04.119
If his stuff was helping, the guy
would be playing tennis months ago.

36:04.454 --> 36:06.705
It's our round of
treatment that's helping.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.124
Right. So that's
what you'll stop.

36:10.001 --> 36:12.378
It shouldn't be more
than 15 to 20 minutes.

36:12.504 --> 36:13.796
So your philosophy is,

36:13.922 --> 36:16.090
if they don't want treatment,
they get it shoved down their throat,

36:16.216 --> 36:19.218
but if it might cure their paralysis,
whoa, better slow down.

36:19.344 --> 36:20.469
Yeah.

36:20.595 --> 36:23.848
My old philosophy
used to be live and let live,

36:23.974 --> 36:25.933
but I'm taking this
needlepoint class,

36:26.059 --> 36:28.143
and they gave us
these really big pillows.

36:28.270 --> 36:30.020
What's your philosophy
on employee relations?

36:30.146 --> 36:32.064
That's a very tiny pillow.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.941
Great. It sounds like
you know what you're doing.

36:35.569 --> 36:37.736
Greg, can I have a word?

36:37.863 --> 36:40.698
Can it wait for
the commercial, Marty?

36:40.824 --> 36:42.867
Say hi to
my friend Jimmy.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.160
Pleasure.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.122
Your diagnostic trial.

36:48.248 --> 36:50.499
Seriously, commercial's
in about five minutes.

36:50.625 --> 36:51.709
That's a dangerous game.

36:51.835 --> 36:53.377
Only if we're
watching in the bathtub.

36:54.129 --> 36:57.214
I need to know exactly what medications
you were giving John Henry.

36:57.340 --> 36:58.465
Forget it.

36:58.592 --> 37:00.843
And if Foreman tells you
what John Henry used to be on...

37:00.969 --> 37:03.721
- You're gonna fire him?
- Nope.

37:03.847 --> 37:06.181
I'll make him live out every day
of his two-year contract.

37:06.308 --> 37:07.933
- Foreman asked to leave?
- Not yet.

37:08.059 --> 37:11.687
- But how do you know I made him...
- You're a polite twit, not an idiot.

37:12.606 --> 37:16.317
I need to know what medications
you've taken him off of.

37:18.737 --> 37:21.155
Wait a second.
You're not an idiot.

37:24.784 --> 37:28.954
You need to know what medications
I've stopped because...

37:31.958 --> 37:33.667
He's getting worse.

37:38.757 --> 37:41.550
Right now you still
work for me. Come on.

37:43.637 --> 37:45.512
No feeling, no wiggling.

37:45.639 --> 37:47.723
Bad news is John Henry's back
where he started.

37:47.849 --> 37:49.600
Good news is
Hamilton looks bad.

37:49.726 --> 37:50.768
Yeah, it's not
whether you win or lose.

37:50.936 --> 37:52.269
It's whether
the other guy loses.

37:52.395 --> 37:53.771
What was the first thing
we put him on?

37:53.897 --> 37:54.939
Steroids, for the pneumonia.

37:55.065 --> 37:57.858
Well, put him back on them.
Give him 24 hours. See what happens.

37:57.984 --> 37:59.401
His lungs
aren't great.

37:59.527 --> 38:00.986
They might cause another
respiratory collapse.

38:01.112 --> 38:01.946
I sure hope not.

38:02.072 --> 38:04.198
I didn't much like that lawyer.
And get an MRI.

38:04.324 --> 38:05.407
He already got one
and an MRA.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.993
Well, obviously something is
different now. Do it again.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.161
Chase, take care
of the scan.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.121
Cameron, put him
on the steroids.

38:14.167 --> 38:16.460
We should
probably talk, huh?

38:21.841 --> 38:22.925
Thin cuts.

38:23.051 --> 38:24.009
What levels?

38:24.552 --> 38:27.846
T-9 through the cauda equina,
same as the last time.

38:28.932 --> 38:31.850
You really think House would let
Foreman out of his contract?

38:31.977 --> 38:35.104
He has to. If he doesn't,
he's telling Foreman he needs him.

38:35.230 --> 38:37.189
House can't handle that.

38:42.779 --> 38:43.904
Oh, my God.

38:49.703 --> 38:51.328
I checked him out.

38:52.831 --> 38:54.581
He's a great doctor.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.334
You think he's
better than I am?

38:58.420 --> 39:02.506
- This about your ego?
- Answer the question.

39:03.925 --> 39:06.427
It's not gonna change
how I think about myself.

39:06.553 --> 39:08.262
Might affect my
opinion of you,

39:08.388 --> 39:11.140
but that shouldn't affect
your opinion of yourself.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.392
Now I'm getting confused.

39:13.601 --> 39:15.310
If you think he's a better doctor
than I am,

39:15.437 --> 39:16.895
then you should take the job.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.731
Otherwise, you should
get him to buy you

39:18.857 --> 39:20.858
two or three more
nostalgic lunches

39:20.984 --> 39:22.568
and then politely decline.

39:22.694 --> 39:25.988
It's that simple? I should just
ignore the mockery and abuse?

39:26.114 --> 39:29.074
- Oh, how do I abuse you?
- How do you not?

39:29.200 --> 39:30.034
If I make a mistake...

39:30.160 --> 39:31.827
I hold you accountable.
So what?

39:31.953 --> 39:34.872
Dr. Hamilton forgives.
He's capable of moving on.

39:34.998 --> 39:36.498
That is not what he does.

39:36.624 --> 39:38.083
I screwed up his case.
He told me...

39:38.209 --> 39:39.752
He never said
you were forgiven.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.712
I was there. He said
it wasn't your fault.

39:41.838 --> 39:43.839
- So?
- So, it was.

39:44.799 --> 39:46.842
You took a chance.
You did something great.

39:46.968 --> 39:49.094
You were wrong,
but it was still great.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.262
You should feel great that it was great.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.806
You should feel like crap
that it was wrong.

39:52.932 --> 39:54.308
That's the difference
between him and me.

39:54.684 --> 39:56.935
He thinks you do your job,
and what will be, will be.

39:57.062 --> 40:00.147
I think that what I do
and what you do matters.

40:01.483 --> 40:04.193
He sleeps better at night.
He shouldn't.

40:07.280 --> 40:11.283
- Arteriovenous malformation.
- Intradural. Compressing his spine.

40:12.994 --> 40:14.912
Causing his paralysis.

40:15.997 --> 40:17.915
How could Hamilton
have missed an AVM?

40:18.041 --> 40:21.585
Well, we missed it, too,
'cause it wasn't there before.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.171
Are you saying it
just grew overnight?

40:24.297 --> 40:25.923
No.

40:26.049 --> 40:29.843
It was on the spine.
It wasn't on the MRI.

40:30.386 --> 40:32.137
Same anatomic location.

40:33.014 --> 40:34.014
It's not there.

40:34.808 --> 40:37.142
- Well, what is there?
- Nothing.

40:37.811 --> 40:40.562
Or something that
looks like nothing.

40:42.315 --> 40:45.609
- Background noise, static?
- Scar tissue? Inflammation?

40:45.735 --> 40:49.363
If it's inflammation,
the steroids would've shrunk it down.

40:49.823 --> 40:52.032
Revealing the AVM,

40:52.158 --> 40:54.368
which has always been there,
hiding behind its own swelling.

40:54.494 --> 40:56.203
We remove that,
he'll walk again.

41:45.795 --> 41:47.004
Dr. House.

41:49.465 --> 41:52.176
Cora's meeting me
outside with the limo.

41:52.594 --> 41:54.386
I'm being discharged.

41:55.263 --> 41:58.223
50 bucks says
I can beat you to the curb.

41:59.475 --> 42:01.560
Thanks for sticking
with the case.

42:01.686 --> 42:03.729
I can't do anything else.

42:05.732 --> 42:08.025
You're much more easily amused
when you can walk.

42:08.151 --> 42:09.401
How bizarre.

42:10.195 --> 42:12.404
I'm guessing that
you weren't exactly Mr. Sunshine

42:12.530 --> 42:15.157
even before
your leg got messed up.

42:19.370 --> 42:20.454
I want you to have this.

42:31.174 --> 42:32.216
Wow.

42:32.342 --> 42:33.383
You can sell it
if you want to.

42:33.509 --> 42:35.469
Just promise me
you won't play it.

42:40.725 --> 42:43.018
How many of those
pills you taking?

42:44.771 --> 42:46.063
I'm in pain.

42:48.191 --> 42:49.316
Yes.

42:51.694 --> 42:52.653
Aren't we all?

42:55.281 --> 42:56.823
So, where do you
buy these things?

42:56.950 --> 42:58.200
Do they have cane stores?

42:58.326 --> 43:02.287
Oh, don't worry about it. You'll be
jogging before you need a second one.

43:02.413 --> 43:04.289
See you tomorrow,
Eric.
