00:15.098 --> 00:18.601
I came home one day,
and my wife was using heroin.

00:18.977 --> 00:21.021
I fell in love with it pretty quick.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.149
One bag of dope turned into
a gram of dope.

00:24.232 --> 00:26.067
One gram turned into two grams.

00:26.151 --> 00:29.654
The more you do, the more you had to do
to get that same high.

00:30.780 --> 00:33.283
I never expected to live to be 25.

00:33.450 --> 00:34.784
I can't not use.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.120
If I don't use, I'm going to be sick.

00:38.955 --> 00:42.917
I'm 19 years old,
I was up to five Percocets a day.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.253
I didn't have a job.

00:45.712 --> 00:46.880
I was homeless.

00:47.422 --> 00:50.258
I felt like the world didn't need me.

00:51.509 --> 00:54.304
I probably was in high school
the first time I smoked crack.

00:54.846 --> 00:57.390
Did heroin not too long after that.

00:58.224 --> 01:01.269
I'd never really wanted to be in rehab.

01:01.352 --> 01:04.688
Too many of my friends failed over
and over again and family members.

01:06.024 --> 01:07.734
I thought drugs and alcohol...

01:07.817 --> 01:09.402
That's what I grew up around, yeah?

01:09.778 --> 01:11.738
I thought that was just the way
everybody lived.

01:11.821 --> 01:13.448
I didn't know people lived life sober.

01:34.844 --> 01:35.762
Hey, Chad.

01:35.845 --> 01:37.889
-How are you?
-I'm Jeff.

01:38.014 --> 01:39.599
-Meet Jeff.
-Jeff. Chad Bishop.

01:39.682 --> 01:40.767
Nice to meet you.

01:41.226 --> 01:43.019
-Excited?
-Yeah, I'm really excited.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.104
That's good, that's great.

01:45.688 --> 01:48.066
Fired up, man. Number one!

01:48.149 --> 01:49.442
Number one!

01:49.526 --> 01:51.069
How's it going?

01:51.194 --> 01:52.904
You guys got anything to carry in?

01:52.987 --> 01:55.573
No, he's got everything he's got
right there in his hands.

01:55.657 --> 01:58.076
- All right. All right.
- Nice place.

01:58.743 --> 02:01.663
We were still working on it
when we opened up.

02:01.746 --> 02:05.625
-Wow. Nice.
-Same bathroom, same way.

02:05.708 --> 02:06.668
This is yours.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.044
-This is mine.
-Which bed do you want?

02:10.755 --> 02:12.757
-This one.
-All right.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.635
You should see the mat I was sleeping on.

02:15.718 --> 02:16.719
I know the feeling.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.304
It's like sleeping on a towel.

02:19.180 --> 02:22.100
Yeah, these are comfortable beds.
Try it out.

02:22.183 --> 02:23.601
Yeah, man, this is awesome.

02:24.519 --> 02:28.565
He had his court hearing yesterday
for his girls,

02:28.648 --> 02:30.191
and because he was coming up here,

02:30.316 --> 02:32.569
they extended his period,

02:32.652 --> 02:35.280
so they didn't take his girls away
from him yet, so...

02:35.405 --> 02:37.699
-That's good.
-How old are they now? One and three?

02:37.782 --> 02:39.325
-Two and three.
-Okay.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.495
-How long have you been married?
-Since I was 20.

02:42.579 --> 02:43.955
Really? You're 25?

02:44.038 --> 02:45.665
-In June, I turn 26.
-Twenty-six?

02:46.499 --> 02:49.127
-No gang affiliations, anything like that?
-No.

02:49.502 --> 02:50.587
Very good.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.631
Tomorrow basically,
we'll wake you up, get you fed,

02:53.715 --> 02:56.634
and then we're going to go over
to the farm and feed the animals,

02:56.718 --> 02:58.386
do a little bit of work over there.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.931
Evening time, around six, seven o'clock,

03:02.432 --> 03:06.728
that would be some of your time
for educational classes.

03:07.020 --> 03:11.065
You've been here about 45 minutes.
You're officially our senior resident.

03:12.942 --> 03:14.652
- It's a lot of responsibility.
- Yeah!

03:15.320 --> 03:17.071
- Here I am, that's me.
- You're it.

03:35.131 --> 03:38.176
I mean, if that doesn't give you
a new perspective,

03:38.259 --> 03:39.427
I don't know what will.

03:53.274 --> 03:57.320
The guys won't have a lot
of outside world contact,

03:57.654 --> 03:59.280
unless it's supervised.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.618
You really want to kind of keep the guys
from isolating,

04:03.701 --> 04:05.995
because that's kind of
where their life's been.

04:06.537 --> 04:08.081
It's been them and their drug.

04:09.540 --> 04:14.671
Farming life is a series of advances
and a couple of setbacks,

04:14.754 --> 04:19.926
and they'll be able to experience
that kind of stuff sober.

04:20.510 --> 04:23.554
Life's not always going to be perfect,
it's not always going to be good,

04:23.680 --> 04:26.516
and you have to learn to live
with pain and setbacks,

04:27.016 --> 04:30.103
without having drugs to dampen it for you.

04:32.814 --> 04:33.731
Morning, guys.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.483
-Morning, Mark.
-How are you doing?

04:35.608 --> 04:36.859
Fantastic.

04:37.068 --> 04:39.445
You ever worked with animals before?
Have you?

04:39.529 --> 04:42.198
-Yeah, my papa had a little farm.
-A farm? Okay.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.083
These are the ones
that are gonna go out on pasture.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.836
You can just stick it in front of him.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.130
He should at least for a while.

04:57.630 --> 04:58.881
Tip it up. There you go.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.800
- You look like you've done it.
- Yeah.

05:00.883 --> 05:01.718
Okay.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.722
This is my brother Benny.

05:06.514 --> 05:09.225
He's on heroin and meth real bad
right now.

05:09.726 --> 05:13.187
That's Aaron, my mom's boyfriend John,
the one she's married to now.

05:13.521 --> 05:15.648
That's his son that ODed.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.818
He's passed away,
and that's my brother AJ.

05:19.527 --> 05:21.195
Which is locked up in prison

05:21.821 --> 05:25.283
for robbing Hardee's
in Sabraton, Morgantown,

05:25.783 --> 05:26.993
to get drugs and stuff.

05:29.746 --> 05:30.872
That's my sister,

05:31.164 --> 05:33.541
my mom and her two kids,

05:33.624 --> 05:35.293
but she don't have nothing
to do with them.

05:35.376 --> 05:37.837
She's on the run from the law right now.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.465
And my mom has both kids.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.009
These are cute.

05:44.010 --> 05:44.844
That's my kid.

05:45.845 --> 05:48.014
That's her when she just started walking.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.150
Got a lot of amends to make
to a lot of these people,

05:59.233 --> 06:00.735
but I don't know who they are.

06:02.236 --> 06:04.030
I've broken into a lot of these houses.

06:04.113 --> 06:06.991
I've gone through... in my addiction.

06:10.119 --> 06:13.539
- There's some amends you just can't make.
- There are some.

06:15.625 --> 06:18.920
Some of them, maybe you could write
a letter, put it in their mailbox.

06:19.587 --> 06:22.757
'Cause it would be risky knocking
on the door, some of them,

06:22.840 --> 06:26.386
telling them what you did,
they may not take too kindly to it.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.848
Especially in these parts,
people tend to carry guns with them.

06:30.932 --> 06:32.767
Yeah, they'll shoot you around here.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.314
See that church
way over on that hill?

06:38.398 --> 06:40.358
- Yeah.
- That's where my real dad's buried.

06:40.441 --> 06:41.442
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:42.402 --> 06:46.072
-Did you ever know him?
-No, I was three when he passed away.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.616
-That's when my mom left.
-What happened?

06:48.866 --> 06:50.493
A tree got cut down on Papa.

06:50.576 --> 06:51.577
-Really?
-Yeah.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.579
-Wow.
-At a logging yard.

06:56.833 --> 07:01.003
Then a year later, my mom left,
went to a bar and never came home.

07:02.338 --> 07:05.800
-So she left when you were three?
-Three years old, yeah.

07:05.883 --> 07:07.802
And didn't come back until I was 15 or 16.

07:07.885 --> 07:09.929
Jeez! Where'd she go?

07:10.012 --> 07:10.888
I don't know.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.866
I like to sit here sometimes quietly.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.535
Like, when you're, like, high and stuff,

07:32.618 --> 07:34.454
you don't really think about what...

07:35.329 --> 07:36.914
You know what I mean? You ain't got...

07:36.998 --> 07:38.666
I wake up, my first thing is,

07:38.833 --> 07:40.710
I gotta find my needle
and go find me some dope.

07:40.793 --> 07:41.752
You know what I mean?

07:42.253 --> 07:43.713
But now that you're not high,

07:43.796 --> 07:46.591
you come out here in the morning,
you listen to all the birds.

07:46.674 --> 07:49.093
When you're high,
you don't focus on shit like that.

07:49.677 --> 07:52.221
I hear a bird over here right now.
You know what I mean?

07:52.305 --> 07:53.764
And you can hear some over here.

07:54.348 --> 07:56.767
When they go together, it's like...
You know what I mean?

07:57.477 --> 07:59.145
You appreciate the little things in life.

07:59.228 --> 08:01.022
Yeah, you do, but when you're high,

08:01.105 --> 08:03.024
you really don't focus
on no shit like that.

08:03.107 --> 08:05.651
-You see through it.
-Yeah, I agree.

08:06.068 --> 08:06.903
Beautiful.

08:07.778 --> 08:10.072
Let's go. Let's go!

08:12.533 --> 08:14.619
And instead of posting,
see if it wedges.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.913
If it wedges,
don't take it all the way out.

08:17.246 --> 08:18.789
-Minimalistic.
-Yes.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.670
Long story short,
I've been a drug addict since I was 16,

08:24.754 --> 08:27.381
and in and out of programs.
This is my tenth program.

08:28.132 --> 08:32.178
And I came to Jacob's Ladder. I was
at a wilderness program before this.

08:32.886 --> 08:37.058
And my mom found it for me,
and you know,

08:37.140 --> 08:40.102
I've never been on a recovery place
like this where it's on a farm.

08:42.938 --> 08:44.190
I know what people want to hear,

08:44.273 --> 08:47.777
so it's really easy for me
to skate through a program undetected.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.238
You know, they say,
"This kid is really doing good."

08:50.363 --> 08:51.781
Really, I was bullshitting my way,

08:51.864 --> 08:53.783
waiting to get out,
on the outside, to use.

08:53.908 --> 08:56.077
Deep down I really wanna be sober.
I don't wanna die.

08:56.410 --> 08:59.455
Nobody really wants to die.
Even a normal human doesn't wanna die.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.374
I don't know, I'm just...

09:02.542 --> 09:05.253
I'm really excited
to actually give it 100%,

09:05.753 --> 09:07.547
'cause I've never done that before.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.340
I've never given it my all.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.496
-Craig, addict.
-Hi, Craig.

09:40.580 --> 09:44.000
So what I wanna do next
is we're gonna go around,

09:44.083 --> 09:46.502
we're gonna check in,
how your week's going,

09:46.586 --> 09:48.546
what's the struggle,
what's going well for you.

09:49.213 --> 09:51.882
-I'm Adam, and I'm an addict.
-Hey, Adam.

09:52.633 --> 09:55.136
Yeah, you know,
this week's been up and down.

09:56.387 --> 09:58.931
I got, you know,
the first letter from my grandma.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.811
She... She's, like,
the center of my addiction.

10:03.894 --> 10:07.273
You know, that was, like,
where I got all my money.

10:07.356 --> 10:09.275
You know, if I needed something,
I ran there,

10:09.358 --> 10:12.486
and either she gave it to me,
or most of the time,

10:12.570 --> 10:15.990
I just conned her out of it one way
or another, to put it blatantly.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.535
She sent me this letter and she said,

10:20.119 --> 10:22.955
"I forgive you. I couldn't be mad at you.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.707
I love you," and all this,

10:24.790 --> 10:26.334
and I was just thinking, like,

10:26.417 --> 10:29.211
"I took a significant amount of money
from this woman."

10:29.295 --> 10:31.797
I mean, I ruined her life in my eyes.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.007
I mean, she's 86,

10:33.549 --> 10:37.595
and she's working at the Goodwill,
so that she is not homeless right now.

10:38.012 --> 10:40.556
Myself, I couldn't just forgive
someone like that.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.224
I don't care who they are.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.727
I don't deserve
the forgiveness that I got,

10:44.810 --> 10:47.647
that quickly and out of nowhere.

10:48.439 --> 10:49.899
I just don't know what to do.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.193
That make sense to you guys?

10:52.276 --> 10:53.152
Yeah, dude.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.687
Don't run, you guys.

11:28.771 --> 11:29.772
I almost ran.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.065
Thank you.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.234
You saved my life many a time.

11:33.984 --> 11:35.486
You have no idea how true that is.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.114
Fourteen times I've overdosed, guys.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.323
Fourteen times.

11:52.128 --> 11:55.798
Dude, I busted my shin on that rope.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.720
Oh!

12:35.713 --> 12:37.923
Chad told me we were going for a hayride.

12:38.716 --> 12:40.426
This ain't what I had in mind.

12:40.801 --> 12:42.178
Yeah, I know.

12:47.224 --> 12:48.601
These are peppers here.

12:48.684 --> 12:50.436
You can tell in the leaves.

12:50.519 --> 12:51.353
Yep.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.398
I feel like if we're flexible...

12:56.317 --> 12:57.735
and we're compassionate,

12:58.819 --> 13:03.157
then, I mean, that to me is the best
combination of trying to help people.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.993
I mean, if you lose either one
of those two qualities,

13:06.076 --> 13:07.745
I think you're really hamstrung.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.747
No matter what you're doing,

13:09.830 --> 13:13.292
if you're giving these guys a place
to be surrounded by good people,

13:13.375 --> 13:15.461
I mean, they're way ahead
of the game already.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.681
Jake and Jerrica, his older sister,

13:27.765 --> 13:30.559
in the Bahamas, we went conch diving.

13:31.519 --> 13:34.814
Jake was probably withdrawing
in this picture.

13:34.897 --> 13:38.192
-I was, yeah.
-I didn't know at the time, but he was...

13:38.734 --> 13:41.445
-I thought you knew. You said...
-Did I know then, in this one?

13:41.529 --> 13:43.364
-You had a hunch.
-Yeah.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.784
I can't remember,
but look how skinny he is.

13:48.077 --> 13:48.911
Pretty skinny.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.705
-I got worse than that, though.
-Yeah.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.375
'Cause I was more interested in pills.

13:54.959 --> 13:58.796
I think I, like, snuck one Oxy with me.

13:59.171 --> 14:00.673
-Did you?
-Uh-huh.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.218
Looking pretty... pretty strung out.

14:04.718 --> 14:06.345
-That's 'cause I was, yeah.
-Yeah.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.399
Everything's hurting.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.652
Arm and legs a little bit higher.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.783
How did your court date go last week?

14:27.867 --> 14:28.826
Oh, man.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.286
Not good?

14:32.204 --> 14:36.292
The court date went good,
but I got some bad news about my daughter.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.461
Put me in a bad mood all week.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.214
My daughter went to a foster home.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.592
While she was in there, they molested her.

14:44.717 --> 14:48.012
And I just found out about it,
so we're in the middle of that.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.764
It's being investigated right now
and stuff.

14:51.515 --> 14:53.225
You know what I mean?
It's been a bad week.

14:55.436 --> 14:58.522
Jeff, you got quiet,
brother. What are you thinking?

14:59.273 --> 15:00.149
What do you mean?

15:00.649 --> 15:02.568
You're not quiet usually,
so what's going on?

15:02.651 --> 15:04.153
-I'm just kicking it, dude.
-Huh?

15:04.236 --> 15:05.696
Just kicking it, listening.

15:06.530 --> 15:09.992
What went on for you when I brought up
stuff in your life right now, then?

15:10.701 --> 15:13.203
I don't know. I keep telling myself
all day today,

15:13.287 --> 15:14.788
if I wouldn't have picked up and used,

15:15.581 --> 15:17.708
you know what I mean,
if I wouldn't have got caught,

15:18.459 --> 15:21.587
they would never have got taken,
she would never have got molested.

15:21.670 --> 15:22.880
Do you know what I mean?

15:23.255 --> 15:26.926
I feel like my actions led
to that shit, man.

15:28.844 --> 15:31.347
-I just want to kill the dude.
-I get it, man.

15:33.390 --> 15:36.185
One thing's on my shoulder
saying I'm doing the right thing,

15:36.268 --> 15:38.395
stay here, and it'll all work out.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.774
Let the cops,
let the law take care of it and stuff,

15:42.024 --> 15:43.651
and another part of my shoulder's like,

15:43.734 --> 15:46.278
"Man, step the fuck up.
Kill this motherfucker."

15:46.362 --> 15:47.446
You know what I mean?

15:48.280 --> 15:49.657
Protect your daughter.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.328
I'm just lost.
I don't know what to do, man.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.330
I just don't wanna go there.

15:57.247 --> 16:00.209
A part of me wants to stay, too,
so I'm just... I'm lost.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.461
I just... I don't know what to do.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.217
I don't fucking know, man.

16:10.094 --> 16:10.970
I don't know.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.557
Well, what...

16:16.517 --> 16:20.479
You're doing it right now though, right?
You're talking, coming out with it.

16:20.562 --> 16:24.525
'Cause it's obvious that all this stuff
is sitting in you, in your head.

16:24.650 --> 16:28.153
You're the one that thinks you get away
with it with all the jokey shit,

16:28.237 --> 16:31.365
but it's obvious you can't have
something like that pop into your life,

16:31.448 --> 16:33.325
and then it just evaporates.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.702
It ain't gonna go away.

16:34.785 --> 16:36.829
So here we got your brothers
here in recovery,

16:36.912 --> 16:38.247
and this is to you guys, right?

16:38.330 --> 16:40.916
You know this is your guy,
he's struggling,

16:41.041 --> 16:43.752
so are we just talking shit every day?

16:44.044 --> 16:45.212
Are we just having fun?

16:45.629 --> 16:48.966
But he's struggling, right?
Now you see on his face.

16:49.299 --> 16:51.260
So what are we doing to support Jeff?

16:51.343 --> 16:52.344
We've all seen it.

16:52.970 --> 16:55.764
It sucks because I've been there too,
and I've gone out over it...

16:56.348 --> 17:00.185
and I came back, like,
I've had a lot of survivor's guilt,

17:00.269 --> 17:02.563
and you know,
I've seen a lot of my friends die.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.772
You've seen your daughter go through
some tough things.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.151
I've got my daughter taken away from me
because of heroin.

17:07.233 --> 17:10.194
I mean, it's gonna sound really harsh,
but you need to be selfish,

17:10.279 --> 17:12.321
because what do you have
to offer to your daughter

17:12.406 --> 17:14.532
versus the world right now?
Absolutely nothing.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.952
Until you get right with yourself.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.664
I failed big time, you know?

17:21.957 --> 17:23.333
She's three years old, man.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.546
And already got fucked with.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.090
I'm supposed to stop that.

17:36.555 --> 17:37.806
I can't do this no more.

17:44.521 --> 17:45.856
Get him up there.

17:48.942 --> 17:52.154
I'm curious to ask
how you guys are feeling right now.

17:52.237 --> 17:55.699
I've been in that exact situation.
Not exactly, like, I've...

17:56.533 --> 17:58.327
I got to the point
where I wanted to leave,

17:58.410 --> 18:00.621
but I wanted to stay
and I ended up leaving.

18:00.704 --> 18:04.124
I ended up relapsing,
ODed another four times, you know?

18:04.208 --> 18:06.335
Yeah, but was it because of that reason?

18:06.418 --> 18:08.170
-Not exactly.
-That your child was molested?

18:08.253 --> 18:10.422
-No, but I've been raped.
-That takes a toll on someone.

18:10.506 --> 18:13.008
I was raped when I was six years old,
so I feel the situation.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.802
We should not compare war stories,
brother.

18:14.885 --> 18:16.762
It's not a war story,
it's an experience.

18:16.845 --> 18:20.933
It's not who goes through
the more horrible thing.

18:21.016 --> 18:23.018
We all go through life on life's terms.

18:23.143 --> 18:24.186
-Right?
-Yeah.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.355
I just feel, like,
a sense of relief almost

18:26.438 --> 18:28.482
that he's got it off his chest,
it's out in the open.

18:28.565 --> 18:31.276
Now he can deal with it.
He's feeling the emotion. It's out.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.605
Who's the new guy?
Which one's the new guy?

19:08.689 --> 19:11.316
I would probably say the guy
with the hair and the beard.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.652
Grateful Dead shirt,
most likely, probably.

19:15.195 --> 19:16.238
Old hippie dude.

19:17.531 --> 19:20.576
He's the first guy that we've
had that's come right off the street,

19:20.909 --> 19:23.370
presumably used
within hours of getting here,

19:24.037 --> 19:26.123
so I think he's going to be a challenge,

19:26.206 --> 19:31.044
'cause every other guy we've seen
has had some sober time.

19:35.048 --> 19:36.383
This was a wily one, man.

19:38.427 --> 19:39.678
- Pick her up.
- Yeah.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.680
Pick her up temporarily.
There you go.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.144
He's definitely detoxing hard and stuff,

19:47.227 --> 19:49.646
and it brings
a whole new atmosphere, so...

19:49.730 --> 19:50.814
I feel his pain, man.

19:50.898 --> 19:54.610
-Hmm? Yeah, we've all been through it.
-Definitely feel his pain.

19:55.110 --> 19:56.737
Most of us have been through it.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.072
Shakes, withdrawals,
throwing up, diarrhea...

19:59.156 --> 20:00.032
Shitting itself.

20:00.824 --> 20:02.868
-The hot to cold sweats.
-Yeah.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.621
-Basically like you got the flu.
-Joints aching,

20:05.704 --> 20:09.708
like someone's stabbing you with a knife
in all your joints every time you move.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.560
I don't want to be on top.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.480
Then I'll go. I'll go downstairs.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.065
Harvest hour.

20:35.776 --> 20:36.944
Get yourself some room.

20:39.446 --> 20:40.822
Take them off, right here.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.673
-One week clean.
-Damn.

20:57.756 --> 20:58.840
Good job, man.

20:58.924 --> 20:59.967
Good job, buddy.

21:00.842 --> 21:04.805
One week down, five months
and three weeks left.

21:04.888 --> 21:06.181
Ain't that the truth?

21:07.266 --> 21:08.225
Yep...

21:09.434 --> 21:10.811
and then a whole lifetime.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.149
Where do you see him in a month from now?

21:16.650 --> 21:18.151
Big old biceps.

21:18.610 --> 21:22.114
I might turn out like Bruce Lee
or something, I'll still be strong.

21:26.827 --> 21:27.661
All right...

21:28.328 --> 21:30.205
-You put 'em over your pants?
-Yeah.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.207
You haven't met Ryan yet, have you?

21:32.291 --> 21:34.251
-No. Ryan, glad to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.545
Are they all girls or what?

21:37.004 --> 21:38.547
-Yeah.
-Can you tell them apart?

21:39.381 --> 21:41.758
I'm sure all the girls got nipples, right?

21:41.967 --> 21:44.678
- Get the dirty one!
- Come here, hog.

21:44.761 --> 21:46.888
Get him! Catch him!

21:47.014 --> 21:51.101
There came point, I was like, "Holy fuck,
I have no clue how to live my life.

21:51.184 --> 21:53.729
I'm a ball of fear
and self-centered misery,

21:54.146 --> 21:55.230
anxiety attacks,"

21:55.731 --> 21:58.150
but then it was like,
"If these are the things I've done

21:58.233 --> 22:01.903
that have led me to misery,
despair, hurt everyone I love,

22:01.987 --> 22:03.322
I've accomplished nothing,

22:03.405 --> 22:05.365
what if I do the opposite
of what I used to do,

22:05.449 --> 22:06.616
how would I feel then?"

22:08.785 --> 22:11.079
You just wanna roll him over.
I'll hold him.

22:11.705 --> 22:13.165
It's only gonna hurt for a second.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.459
Start pulling his nuts up through...

22:15.542 --> 22:16.835
Feel. Make sure you got both.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.295
-Yep.
-Two nuts.

22:19.713 --> 22:20.839
There you go, buddy.

22:22.132 --> 22:23.091
Won't hurt him.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.559
A cow. I've never picked up
a cow in my life.

22:32.934 --> 22:35.103
Come on. Don't kick me.
Sucker's a little heavy.

22:35.187 --> 22:38.148
I just like to think of us
as human beings, no matter what.

22:38.482 --> 22:39.816
We're born human beings.

22:39.900 --> 22:42.110
We're going to die human beings,
we're not perfect,

22:42.194 --> 22:43.528
and we're not defective.

22:43.904 --> 22:47.157
Defective products get thrown
in the trash. You know what I mean?

22:47.908 --> 22:49.159
They get discontinued.

22:53.747 --> 22:57.751
I read this one book that said
the word "stigma" comes from Greek,

22:57.834 --> 23:00.087
and they used to brand people in the face

23:00.170 --> 23:04.049
for being a certain caste
that was looked down upon by society.

23:08.929 --> 23:10.680
And when you're a drug addict,
I mean, like,

23:10.764 --> 23:12.849
you dress a certain way,
you look a certain way.

23:12.933 --> 23:15.268
I mean, the tattoos, everything like that,

23:15.352 --> 23:17.229
and people take one look at you
and judge you.

23:17.312 --> 23:20.899
So I can see why people would want
to change that perception.

23:20.982 --> 23:23.568
Might be something I want
to work on in the future.

23:23.985 --> 23:27.697
Right now I do want to just focus
on the inside stuff, you know?

23:27.781 --> 23:30.951
Maybe the outside stuff
will come later on. I don't know.

23:37.249 --> 23:40.085
It's pretty funny.
Look at these pictures. They're hilarious.

23:40.919 --> 23:45.340
Like, this is where all STDs come from,
is a movie theater.

23:45.465 --> 23:46.299
So...

23:47.968 --> 23:51.012
Make sure you get to know your partner
over chips and a glass of water.

23:52.931 --> 23:55.684
Keep your cool,
stay in control of your decisions.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.686
Limit the amount of alcohol you drink.

23:58.019 --> 23:58.854
Whoops.

23:59.938 --> 24:02.149
This is for chlamydia, gonorrhea,

24:03.233 --> 24:06.236
HPV, hepatitis A, B and C

24:06.695 --> 24:07.821
and HIV,

24:08.447 --> 24:10.198
and AIDS we'll be touching later.

24:11.116 --> 24:15.287
So yeah, it's kinda strenuous,
kinda scared.

24:18.039 --> 24:21.835
I remember very distinctly,
I went to my buddy's house,

24:21.918 --> 24:24.421
also a dealer, and I was sitting there.

24:24.504 --> 24:27.591
It was, like, the first time
I ever went over to shoot up with him,

24:27.674 --> 24:30.760
and he was like, "By the way,
me and my wife have hep C,"

24:30.844 --> 24:32.053
and I was like, "Cool."

24:32.429 --> 24:34.181
I didn't even care. Like, it was...

24:35.891 --> 24:40.312
70% of all IV users have hep C.

24:40.896 --> 24:43.523
So... and, like, I don't know...

24:44.441 --> 24:46.735
That's, like, seven people out of ten.

24:47.319 --> 24:50.739
We have five IV users here,

24:50.822 --> 24:52.824
so it's, like, at least...

24:54.451 --> 24:55.911
I think it's 70% of five,

24:55.994 --> 24:59.247
so, like, three and a half of us
will have hep C.

25:02.334 --> 25:05.420
-I've just seen this board, man.
-You like that?

25:06.087 --> 25:08.131
I do. It's awesome.

25:10.050 --> 25:12.260
-How many will you put in there?
-What do you think, bro?

25:12.344 --> 25:14.471
He's 22, but I don't think we got 22.

25:17.933 --> 25:19.643
Three strikes, you're out.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.631
Easy!

25:57.472 --> 25:59.349
Happy birthday.

25:59.432 --> 26:00.392
What's up?

26:00.559 --> 26:02.811
Nothing, been waiting for your call.

26:04.104 --> 26:06.648
I called my dad, bad decision.

26:07.065 --> 26:10.485
He started the conversation with,
"I'm not giving you a job."

26:10.569 --> 26:13.446
That's, like, the first thing
that came out of his mouth.

26:14.155 --> 26:16.575
Not "How are you doing?
I'm really proud of you."

26:16.658 --> 26:17.492
Oh, no.

26:17.576 --> 26:20.120
I mean, you have to ask that?
I mean, come on now.

26:21.288 --> 26:22.664
At least he said he'd...

26:23.748 --> 26:25.292
Yeah, I don't know where it came from.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.168
He was like,
"I think about you sometimes."

26:27.252 --> 26:28.795
I was like, "Wow."

26:28.878 --> 26:30.338
Wow.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.590
Holy shit.

26:32.549 --> 26:33.383
But that...

26:34.217 --> 26:36.386
So that was about the gist of that.

26:36.469 --> 26:38.555
I'm sorry. That just stinks.

26:38.638 --> 26:41.391
But anyway, it's my birthday,
so fuck that.

26:41.474 --> 26:42.976
Yeah, exactly.

26:54.738 --> 26:57.198
I haven't really seen you
for a long, long, long time.

26:57.449 --> 26:58.283
Yes.

26:59.701 --> 27:00.619
It's been a while.

27:01.161 --> 27:03.455
I can't believe how big your arms are.

27:03.955 --> 27:06.458
Me and a couple other guys work out,
like, every day.

27:06.541 --> 27:07.459
That's great.

27:10.170 --> 27:12.130
-We climb on the rope.
-That's high up there.

27:12.213 --> 27:13.715
I love the ceilings in here.

27:14.549 --> 27:15.967
You have a cigarette on you?

27:17.594 --> 27:19.471
I do, but I don't know
if I wanna give you one,

27:19.554 --> 27:22.182
'cause you said you were doing
really good not smoking.

27:22.265 --> 27:23.433
-I have.
-So I don't wanna...

27:23.516 --> 27:25.644
I smoke three cigarettes a day sometimes.

27:25.727 --> 27:26.978
I don't want to...

27:28.480 --> 27:29.689
encourage that.

27:30.523 --> 27:33.068
So, so happy. So happy.

27:34.235 --> 27:38.948
He hasn't looked this good since he's
probably been 14 years old, health-wise.

27:39.032 --> 27:41.743
You know what I mean?
Just looks absolutely fantastic.

27:47.332 --> 27:49.417
Yeah, I've been eating them.

27:51.044 --> 27:53.421
Tell me if this ain't a bear cave
and a half.

27:56.591 --> 27:58.593
That's the best bear den I've ever seen.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.933
Can't duct it, fuck it.

28:05.809 --> 28:07.519
West Virginia chrome right there.

28:07.602 --> 28:08.728
Got that right.

28:09.771 --> 28:10.897
Is that a big one?

28:11.189 --> 28:12.315
Yeah, we're golden.

28:12.399 --> 28:13.441
Taj Mahal, baby.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.819
All right, do what you gotta do.

28:15.902 --> 28:18.488
-Do what you gotta do...
-Hey, the rings on this...

28:18.571 --> 28:19.989
I called my mom,

28:20.490 --> 28:22.450
and her dog just died,

28:22.534 --> 28:24.661
and she's having some problems
with the house,

28:25.078 --> 28:28.206
and she really stressed
that she didn't like looking at me

28:28.289 --> 28:30.792
with unkempt hair, and so...

28:50.770 --> 28:52.021
Where's that mustard at?

29:17.464 --> 29:19.758
Hey, how are you doing?

29:20.175 --> 29:21.634
Daddy, I got you a present.

29:22.218 --> 29:23.094
A monkey?

29:23.344 --> 29:24.971
Oh, yeah.

29:28.641 --> 29:30.018
We got a new baby.

29:30.727 --> 29:31.936
We got baby sheep.

29:32.479 --> 29:34.439
Stay here with me.
I'll lift you down one by one.

29:35.356 --> 29:36.232
Jump.

29:38.067 --> 29:40.361
- You hear it?
- Yeah, it's in there?

29:41.237 --> 29:42.363
In here. Come look.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.158
Look in there.

29:45.241 --> 29:47.076
- Aww.
- Hi, baby.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.370
- That's so cute.
- Yeah.

29:49.829 --> 29:53.917
Aww! That's so cute!

29:55.627 --> 29:57.545
Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.631
Daddy, I wish you'd...

30:00.340 --> 30:02.967
- Daddy can't.
- Why do you have to stay here?

30:03.051 --> 30:04.636
Just a little while longer,
okay?

30:04.844 --> 30:07.096
And then Daddy come back
and get you, okay?

30:07.305 --> 30:08.765
- You promise?
- I promise.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.395
But why do you got your tears?

30:14.938 --> 30:16.397
They're happy tears.

30:16.481 --> 30:18.942
- Happy tears?
- Yeah, happy tears.

30:19.025 --> 30:20.235
But you're upset.

30:20.318 --> 30:21.986
Happy tears, baby. I love you.

30:27.116 --> 30:29.452
It's rough when they go.
You know what I mean?

30:30.954 --> 30:33.957
Tough waiting five months.
Five months is a long time, man.

30:37.710 --> 30:38.711
Too long.

30:40.129 --> 30:43.258
But, Jeff, this is the work it takes
so that they have a dad

30:43.675 --> 30:46.010
who's sober and happy
and free, you know?

30:46.511 --> 30:48.471
They'll lose you if, you know...

30:48.555 --> 30:51.474
There's nothing certain
about your recovery

30:51.558 --> 30:53.518
if you don't do the work, right?

30:53.601 --> 30:55.728
So then they'll have nobody,
you know what I mean?

30:55.812 --> 30:58.398
That's why doing what you're doing
is so important.

30:59.315 --> 31:02.735
Today, it's sad, but it's also, like,
really happy that they have you.

31:02.819 --> 31:04.112
They got a clean dad.

31:04.195 --> 31:06.406
-That's what I call it, happy tears.
-Yeah.

31:06.489 --> 31:08.867
I wanted to tell them.
I said I was just happy.

31:10.451 --> 31:11.870
Sad to see them go,

31:12.579 --> 31:13.872
but happy that they came.

31:14.247 --> 31:15.081
Yeah.

31:16.916 --> 31:18.543
Happy tears.

31:19.794 --> 31:20.753
It's a new one.

31:20.837 --> 31:21.671
Yeah.

31:41.524 --> 31:46.279
If you want to get free Naloxone
to help save a life,

31:46.362 --> 31:47.739
please go down and sign up,

31:47.822 --> 31:49.991
and we'll do the training
after this event.

31:50.575 --> 31:56.581
Everybody will walk away then
with a $3,600 auto injector kit for free.

32:00.251 --> 32:02.629
Today, here we are,
hosting the very first

32:02.712 --> 32:06.049
West Virginia
Overdose Awareness Day tribute.

32:06.424 --> 32:08.092
We do not want them to be forgotten.

32:08.468 --> 32:11.930
one moment.

32:12.639 --> 32:14.807
Our God, we come to you now,

32:15.391 --> 32:19.354
asking that you be with us as we struggle

32:19.437 --> 32:21.439
to find solutions.

32:22.273 --> 32:25.276
Be with us as we get the strength

32:26.027 --> 32:27.737
to fight the battle.

32:29.030 --> 32:31.532
Andrew Placo, 25.

32:32.575 --> 32:34.410
Rose Alero, 51.

32:35.411 --> 32:37.538
Cruz Shepherd, 23.

32:38.164 --> 32:40.124
Patrick, 38.

32:40.917 --> 32:43.169
James Brandon Burdet, 29.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.672
Jonathan...

32:45.922 --> 32:48.716
I like how two guys came up
with their shades down.

32:49.550 --> 32:52.136
You could tell they were high,
but at least they came.

32:54.430 --> 32:55.682
-Yeah.
-It says something.

32:56.849 --> 32:58.059
Yeah.

33:00.144 --> 33:02.897
It's about raising
overdose awareness, so...

33:03.940 --> 33:06.192
Who cares if they're high?
At least they're here, man.

33:06.943 --> 33:07.986
They're trying.

33:11.823 --> 33:12.824
Thomas Surelle.

33:14.242 --> 33:15.284
Matt Brown.

33:16.869 --> 33:19.163
Travis Cougar, age 38.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.542
Can't believe that one kid's name
they read was 16.

33:23.668 --> 33:25.837
Shelia Bayes, 27.

33:55.199 --> 33:56.868
- How you doing?
- Good.

33:56.951 --> 33:59.037
-We brought goods.
-You won't even recognize him.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.538
That's exciting. How's he doing?

34:00.621 --> 34:02.832
-He's doing great. Absolutely great.
-Good.

34:04.834 --> 34:06.836
Ahh!

34:07.920 --> 34:08.963
Look at you, man.

34:12.550 --> 34:13.760
Good to see you.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.971
Come here.
Let's get a group hug going.

34:17.054 --> 34:18.889
-What's up, bro?
-Not much.

34:18.973 --> 34:20.349
You look like Willie Nelson, man.

34:23.603 --> 34:24.771
-Sounds good.
-Let me see you.

34:24.853 --> 34:26.397
-You got some sun.
-Yeah.

34:26.773 --> 34:28.107
-Got some muscles.
-A little bit.

34:28.190 --> 34:29.484
-Yeah.
-Some tone back.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.319
Here's a trick. Hold out your hand.

34:31.944 --> 34:34.739
Yeah.

34:36.532 --> 34:37.366
This guy...

34:37.449 --> 34:39.952
That was actually
pretty good. It was this year.

34:40.036 --> 34:40.870
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:40.953 --> 34:42.496
- Look at you.
- Gorgeous place.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.248
- Stop it.
- Yep...

34:44.331 --> 34:47.335
All right, I'll stop it.
We're here to hang out. Not just smile.

34:52.215 --> 34:55.134
I had a really fucked-up perception
of what love was.

34:55.885 --> 34:57.386
I just treated people like shit.

34:57.845 --> 35:01.349
You're like, "Fuck love."
I don't really care about it.

35:01.432 --> 35:04.143
It's not that important to me.
I thought maybe it's just a construct.

35:04.227 --> 35:06.771
You know, like a human construct.
Like, it doesn't exist.

35:06.854 --> 35:09.690
People just say they love you
so they can use you or whatever.

35:10.233 --> 35:14.695
And now it just seems like this thing
that exists, like air, water, whatever.

35:14.779 --> 35:16.155
Like, it's like an element.

35:16.739 --> 35:19.909
I guess you gotta be living
in the real world to feel it.

35:19.992 --> 35:24.038
I haven't been in the real world
for a long time, so kinda weird,

35:24.122 --> 35:27.583
but it is a good thing.

35:27.667 --> 35:29.293
Right? That's all I got.

35:29.377 --> 35:31.504
Thank you, Ryan.

35:34.465 --> 35:35.299
Yeah.

35:35.800 --> 35:36.801
That's what we're doing?

35:59.115 --> 36:00.449
Andrew came to me today,

36:00.908 --> 36:03.452
let me know that the barn dance,
they're gonna have alcohol,

36:03.536 --> 36:05.663
which to me, creates a conflict.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.206
I'm concerned about it.

36:07.290 --> 36:09.625
On one hand,
I know you guys have worked hard,

36:09.709 --> 36:12.044
I know you guys are excited
about going to the dance,

36:12.128 --> 36:14.338
and on the other hand,
there's going to be alcohol there,

36:14.422 --> 36:16.674
and a lot of you guys,
all you guys are pretty new,

36:16.757 --> 36:18.217
and some guys are really new.

36:18.926 --> 36:22.221
To be able to go
in a real life situation somewhat,

36:22.305 --> 36:23.556
I think it could be good.

36:24.140 --> 36:25.808
I don't personally want to go.

36:26.225 --> 36:28.186
This is the Aurora Barn Dance.

36:28.269 --> 36:31.314
We're gonna be there with a bunch
of people that probably don't like us,

36:31.397 --> 36:33.107
and it's just gonna be awkward.

36:33.649 --> 36:36.944
I'm sorry, Adam, but there could be
20 people there in recovery.

36:37.028 --> 36:39.572
Like, we don't know who's gonna
be down there and who's not.

36:39.906 --> 36:43.284
I can't just pigeonhole everyone
and say they're all a bunch of assholes

36:43.367 --> 36:45.661
that don't like us.
Like, that's not true.

36:46.287 --> 36:48.206
I'm here to have fun, too.

36:48.831 --> 36:52.168
Drugs and alcohol to me
are the opposite of fun.

36:52.293 --> 36:54.378
It may sound like bullshit
to a lot of people,

36:54.462 --> 36:58.591
but I had gotten to a point
in my life where it wasn't fun.

36:58.674 --> 36:59.884
It was a fucking chore.

37:02.720 --> 37:06.140
But I think it's just important we don't
walk into this dance or anywhere else,

37:06.224 --> 37:09.727
saying, "I'm powerful, I got some days,
therefore, I'm not going to get high."

37:09.810 --> 37:12.355
It's bullshit.
Any of us are one thought away.

37:36.796 --> 37:38.422
-Let's go.
-Go to the front.

37:39.006 --> 37:40.383
-No.
-Go to the front.

37:40.466 --> 37:42.593
-Leave me be.
-Come on, I'll go with you.

37:42.677 --> 37:43.552
Yeah!

37:45.221 --> 37:47.682
I'll go up there.
I need someone to make me dance.

37:48.849 --> 37:50.559
-Feel out of place, don't you?
-Yeah, I do.

37:50.643 --> 37:53.646
Yeah, but you gotta challenge it
'cause you're not out of place, dude.

37:54.855 --> 37:56.315
We need people on the floor.

37:56.399 --> 37:58.818
This is a very simple, simple dance.

37:59.235 --> 38:00.569
Just pick a partner.

38:02.697 --> 38:05.116
-Come on, dude. Go.
-Go ahead, Ryan.

38:05.199 --> 38:07.243
-There you go.
-I'm Ryan.

38:07.994 --> 38:08.953
Nice to meet you.

38:09.829 --> 38:11.664
-I'm Rush.
-I'm Debbie.

38:11.747 --> 38:13.207
-Nice to meet you, Debbie.
-You, too.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.961
Son, just go pick a partner.

38:17.837 --> 38:19.714
This is it, you guys. Come on up!

38:19.797 --> 38:22.383
There are some ladies here
that need someone. Come on.

38:24.677 --> 38:26.971
Now join your hands and circle out.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.811
Now back to the right.

38:38.441 --> 38:40.526
Swing your honey once around.

38:43.195 --> 38:44.655
And promenade.

38:46.032 --> 38:46.907
Okay, all four.

38:49.201 --> 38:50.077
Well, whatever!

38:55.750 --> 38:58.002
Couple number one, out to the right.

38:58.794 --> 38:59.754
Go right on.

39:01.839 --> 39:03.549
Jeff, you're causing major confusion.

39:06.385 --> 39:08.387
This is the most fun I've had
in a long time.

39:21.025 --> 39:23.819
I want to thank you guys
for dancing. You can go and sit down.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.044
When do you want this place ready by?

39:40.920 --> 39:41.921
Couple weeks.

39:42.922 --> 39:45.049
Yeah.

39:46.425 --> 39:48.844
Honestly though,
even if it was a sober house,

39:48.928 --> 39:51.639
and we were still working on it
while we lived here, it wouldn't be...

39:51.722 --> 39:54.058
Jorge is getting the kitchen done...

39:54.141 --> 39:57.436
Everyone wants to stay in this area
when they finish Jacob's Ladder,

39:57.561 --> 40:00.648
and so we purchased a property,
we're finishing it up,

40:00.731 --> 40:03.818
so that it can be a sober living setting
for these guys.

40:04.527 --> 40:07.571
If they can get jobs in the community
and they want to stay here,

40:07.655 --> 40:10.491
that keeps them connected
to what they're doing already.

40:11.826 --> 40:13.160
-Are you tired?
-Yes.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.703
-You've been scraping?
-A lot.

40:14.787 --> 40:18.707
I worry every day about these guys
leaving here and going back home,

40:19.125 --> 40:21.335
getting back to the playground
and to the friends

40:21.419 --> 40:23.796
and all the things
that they used to get into.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.340
When they're here,
there's a little vacation

40:26.424 --> 40:29.927
from all the chaos of their lives
that they got themselves into,

40:30.010 --> 40:32.012
and they're gonna go back
to the real world.

40:32.096 --> 40:33.639
We're trying to get them ready for it.

40:34.306 --> 40:36.600
It's a great start here,
that's what it is.

40:36.684 --> 40:40.146
I mean, nothing's promised
when a guy leaves our program.

40:40.855 --> 40:43.065
- I'm an addict named Jeff.
- Jeff.

40:43.149 --> 40:44.859
I'm a father of two girls,

40:44.942 --> 40:48.070
and my addiction took over
a good person

40:48.737 --> 40:52.783
and turned me into a   monster, I can say.

40:54.243 --> 40:56.162
And I didn't care who I hurt, man.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.955
I didn't care what I had to do.

40:58.539 --> 41:00.249
Tearing families apart,

41:00.833 --> 41:02.543
ruining lives, man.

41:06.839 --> 41:10.968
I want that new way of life.
I remember every day when I wake up.

41:11.093 --> 41:13.846
Just don't use today, no matter what.
Don't pick up.

41:15.014 --> 41:18.142
But that's all I grew up around, you know?
That's all I know.

41:18.517 --> 41:22.104
It's all my family does,
it's all my friends do.

41:22.521 --> 41:24.940
Basically, my whole town does it,
you know?

41:25.107 --> 41:25.941
And that's...

41:26.400 --> 41:28.611
I don't know a sober person back home.

41:29.528 --> 41:31.363
It kind of scares me, you know?

41:35.743 --> 41:36.619
Yeah, that's all.

41:36.994 --> 41:39.371
- Thanks, Jeff.
- Thanks. I really appreciate that.

41:41.916 --> 41:43.876
Come on, man.
Teamwork makes the dream work.

41:43.959 --> 41:44.960
There we go.

41:45.044 --> 41:47.171
-Teamwork makes the dream work?
-It did.

41:47.254 --> 41:51.425
I picked Jeff up
six months ago down at the regional jail.

41:51.842 --> 41:53.844
He came running around the corner

41:54.220 --> 41:57.181
with all his worldly possessions
in his hands,

41:57.264 --> 41:59.099
and he looked at me.
He'd never met me before,

41:59.183 --> 42:01.810
and he said, "Let's get out of here
before they change their mind."

42:05.397 --> 42:07.399
Man, I call Jeff "old dad."

42:11.612 --> 42:13.364
Yeah, he's younger than me,

42:14.532 --> 42:15.908
but he's got the wisdom...

42:18.619 --> 42:19.537
...that I needed.

42:20.246 --> 42:23.666
I'm glad he's sticking around
'cause I love this guy, I really do.

42:24.041 --> 42:26.502
Yeah. It's hard not to get emotional.

42:27.294 --> 42:31.257
I'm really gonna miss this place.
I wanna say thanks to you, Dr. B.

42:31.674 --> 42:35.678
You heard me out, listened to my story
and you took me in and gave me a chance.

42:37.846 --> 42:39.515
-Thanks, man.
-I love you, buddy.

42:41.976 --> 42:43.310
- I love you.
- Me too.

42:58.534 --> 43:00.494
I wanna thank everybody for coming out,

43:00.578 --> 43:03.247
helping us celebrate
Adam's graduation.

43:06.041 --> 43:07.626
I'm Leslie. I'm Adam's mom.

43:08.794 --> 43:10.713
It's been a long few years for us.

43:11.547 --> 43:12.840
I am so proud of you,

43:13.299 --> 43:16.760
and all the hard work that you put
into yourself is really paying off,

43:17.636 --> 43:19.138
and I could not be more proud.

43:20.431 --> 43:21.974
I just love you to death.

43:32.568 --> 43:35.362
I'm really not good
with speeches, guys, but...

43:42.745 --> 43:44.705
It's been a long road, man.

43:50.252 --> 43:51.879
It's been a long road.

43:54.214 --> 43:56.675
I've learned what a friend is, you know?

43:58.719 --> 44:00.471
'Cause I didn't know,

44:00.929 --> 44:04.767
and now I have more than I can count
on both of my hands.

44:51.438 --> 44:52.856
Jeff, wake up.

44:53.482 --> 44:55.734
Come on, it's time to drive.

44:55.984 --> 44:56.819
I'm ready.

45:06.912 --> 45:09.998
Not allowed to play rap
once you get to the coal mine.

45:10.082 --> 45:11.375
But we don't give a fuck.

45:54.251 --> 45:56.628
I had some depression the last two days.

45:57.421 --> 45:59.840
Just, I don't know.
I don't know what it was.

46:00.132 --> 46:01.842
Just was down.

46:01.925 --> 46:02.760
"Woe is me."

46:03.761 --> 46:05.387
Obviously it's still under construction.

46:05.471 --> 46:08.265
You know, it's not like
we have the most fun here.

46:12.811 --> 46:15.689
I hung out with that girl last night.
She's fucking weird.

46:16.982 --> 46:17.983
You know, tight.

46:19.985 --> 46:21.528
-Never again.
-Never again.

46:26.533 --> 46:27.659
It's boring up here.

46:28.911 --> 46:29.870
Really boring.

46:33.290 --> 46:36.710
I get up at four o'clock every morning,
take Adam to work.

46:37.419 --> 46:39.379
Pick him up at four o'clock
in the evening.

46:40.005 --> 46:43.842
Go on a couple of dates here and there,
eat out a lot, that's all I do.

46:44.635 --> 46:46.136
I work for that guy, Scott,

46:46.220 --> 46:48.680
and he fucking was smoking weed
in front of me.

46:49.014 --> 46:51.266
It didn't bother me
that he was smoking weed.

46:51.642 --> 46:54.937
Weed ain't my thing anyways.
Drinking ain't my thing.

46:55.270 --> 46:57.731
But if there was a gram of dope,
it probably would have been...

46:57.856 --> 47:00.484
If he was sitting there banging some dope,
I'd probably be like...

47:00.567 --> 47:02.236
You know what I mean?

47:02.694 --> 47:05.322
My thing is when I get in the truck
or the car,

47:06.240 --> 47:07.783
and I put on some music...

47:08.242 --> 47:10.410
You know what I mean?
Just driving down the road.

47:11.328 --> 47:13.622
I feel like I need to smoke a fat blunt.

47:14.164 --> 47:15.624
'Cause that's just what I do.

47:36.603 --> 47:38.438
Thanks, everybody, for coming out.

47:38.730 --> 47:42.985
It's a special day, and this is a special
resident that we're graduating today.

47:43.318 --> 47:46.363
If every program has to have a heart,
that's Ryan.

47:46.446 --> 47:47.990
Ryan's the heart of this program.

47:48.615 --> 47:50.909
Ryan, if there's anything
you'd like to say to the folks...

47:51.743 --> 47:55.998
I turn everything into the topic
of gratitude.

47:56.540 --> 47:57.374
Okay?

47:59.501 --> 48:01.712
Every day of my life,
I'm going to continue

48:02.296 --> 48:05.340
to show you gratitude,

48:05.674 --> 48:07.134
Jacob's Ladder gratitude.

48:07.843 --> 48:09.595
I just love everyone

48:10.429 --> 48:13.515
that has anything to do
with helping people

48:13.599 --> 48:16.685
that everybody else in society
looks down on.

48:17.269 --> 48:20.355
And just... it's amazing.

48:20.731 --> 48:22.649
It's really incredible,

48:22.733 --> 48:25.652
and there is not a lot of places
like this on the planet.

48:26.153 --> 48:28.113
This is a special fucking place.

48:28.780 --> 48:32.034
Everyone that comes here
has an opportunity

48:33.243 --> 48:34.912
that a lot of people don't get.

48:35.454 --> 48:37.372
Someone out there is dying right now.

48:38.540 --> 48:39.374
You know?

48:40.125 --> 48:41.126
It's horrible.

48:41.835 --> 48:43.337
It's gonna keep happening,

48:44.046 --> 48:47.841
but we don't have to be part
of the problem anymore.

48:48.592 --> 48:50.177
You know? We don't.

48:51.011 --> 48:54.514
Like, this is it. This is life today.

48:55.140 --> 48:56.683
And that's all we got.

49:06.610 --> 49:09.488
My keys right there, you hear that?

49:09.571 --> 49:13.450
Ooh, sounds nice.

49:14.117 --> 49:17.287
I think it's this door right here.

49:18.497 --> 49:20.707
I think the counter space is nice, man.

49:21.124 --> 49:23.794
You got a washer and dryer, too.
It's got a laundry chute.

49:25.921 --> 49:26.922
Yeah, we're good.

49:27.130 --> 49:29.841
We're good. No one left a bottle
of Vicodin in here, dude.

49:30.801 --> 49:31.885
We'll be all right.

49:32.928 --> 49:34.805
You got the place,
you get the bigger room.

49:35.097 --> 49:35.931
For now.

49:37.599 --> 49:40.894
Me and Joey had a talk one night
about my aftercare plan,

49:40.978 --> 49:44.064
and he said he thought
he was somewhat confident

49:44.731 --> 49:47.943
that I could live on my own
and probably be better off,

49:48.026 --> 49:50.487
not having to be
in a structured environment,

49:50.570 --> 49:52.364
as long as I had
a good support group, so...

49:52.823 --> 49:54.992
There's a really good community
of recovery here.

49:56.076 --> 49:58.120
I think that you'll fit right in, too.

50:05.002 --> 50:07.170
This is it, man. It's gonna be nice.

50:07.713 --> 50:10.799
Yeah, it's already nice.

50:31.403 --> 50:32.237
Oh, God.

50:32.320 --> 50:34.906
You look like a totally different person.
You look great.

50:35.323 --> 50:39.036
All right, acceptable, responsible
and productive.

51:18.241 --> 51:21.286
I don't wanna get out of bed.

51:25.540 --> 51:27.375
I gotta go pee in a cup.

51:29.628 --> 51:30.796
Story of my life.

51:31.588 --> 51:33.256
You piss in cups all day.

51:33.548 --> 51:34.841
I have to pee in a cup.

51:34.925 --> 51:38.220
I've heard rumors.
It was about Jeff drinking.

51:39.137 --> 51:41.890
Chad told me
that he had been out one night,

51:41.973 --> 51:43.642
and he had given him a breathalyzer,

51:43.725 --> 51:46.520
and it had come back
a little bit positive kind of.

51:47.312 --> 51:48.396
He wasn't sure,

51:48.480 --> 51:50.982
but Jeff claimed
he definitely didn't drink.

51:52.734 --> 51:55.695
Chad called me and said,
"Everybody's worried about your recovery,"

51:55.779 --> 51:56.780
and I said, "Why?"

51:57.489 --> 52:00.117
He said, "You're hanging back out
with your family a lot."

52:00.575 --> 52:02.661
And I'm like, "I ain't gonna stop.

52:03.286 --> 52:05.622
Why would I stop
'cause you told me to stop?"

52:06.206 --> 52:09.000
I've been drug tested 18 fucking times
since I've been up there,

52:09.459 --> 52:10.919
not even up there two months.

52:11.586 --> 52:14.089
Probably breathalyzed ten times.
It's like...

52:15.132 --> 52:18.510
And no one else in that whole place
up there gets that shit.

52:19.010 --> 52:20.595
It's just me for some odd reason.

52:20.679 --> 52:24.224
They think 'cause I'm hanging out
with my sister, I'm gonna use. You know?

52:26.268 --> 52:28.270
Man, if I want to use, I will go use.

52:28.353 --> 52:29.896
If I want to drink, I'll go drink.

52:29.980 --> 52:31.189
I choose not to, so...

52:32.357 --> 52:34.359
I got more important things
to worry about.

52:34.442 --> 52:37.362
I freaking worry about my kids.
I work, you know?

52:37.445 --> 52:40.448
It's like, I'm doing everything right,
leave me the fuck be.

52:42.117 --> 52:43.326
But they just don't.

53:25.410 --> 53:26.703
What's going on, Jeff?

53:29.331 --> 53:30.916
I have no clue what's going on.

53:35.795 --> 53:37.714
I don't know what's gonna happen, man.

53:39.049 --> 53:41.718
This place is turning into
a fucking shit show.

53:42.719 --> 53:45.680
Everybody fucked up,
covering for each other,

53:46.723 --> 53:48.099
drinking in the house.

53:49.684 --> 53:51.269
Doing dumb shit, man.

53:54.147 --> 53:57.234
I've been drinking. Got caught.

53:58.235 --> 54:00.487
So I don't know what's happening,

54:00.570 --> 54:03.323
but the word on the street is that
they're shutting this place down.

54:04.282 --> 54:05.116
So...

54:11.748 --> 54:13.583
to figure it out. I'm not sure.

54:13.667 --> 54:16.336
-Craig, you're just in time, man.
-Yeah? For what?

54:16.628 --> 54:19.005
We're trying to hammer this thing out.

54:19.631 --> 54:24.302
So what Jeff told Chad and I was
that he was at a girl's house.

54:24.386 --> 54:26.763
He was coming home
in the wee hours of the morning,

54:26.846 --> 54:32.227
ran off the road, hit this person's house
and then backed up, left the scene.

54:33.353 --> 54:35.397
Unambiguously, he has relapsed.

54:36.314 --> 54:39.192
And other people confirming
that this has been daily.

54:39.651 --> 54:43.029
I think we could bring him back in here
and help him.

54:44.030 --> 54:44.864
What do you think?

54:45.740 --> 54:48.493
I don't think you can bring all of them
in this residence,

54:48.576 --> 54:51.997
now that they've created
a triad of use and...

54:54.791 --> 54:55.834
enabling.

54:56.376 --> 54:58.712
I think Jeff needs a higher level of care.

54:59.045 --> 55:01.339
the kids.

55:01.756 --> 55:03.633
He's at a legal point,

55:03.717 --> 55:06.219
where if he doesn't get them
in the next 30 days,

55:06.344 --> 55:09.639
he doesn't get another shot at 'em.
He loses them permanently.

55:09.723 --> 55:12.767
That's my biggest fear is
if we sit down with Jeff and say,

55:12.851 --> 55:16.313
"Here's your only course of action,"

55:17.147 --> 55:20.025
he knows what that means,
and he knows,

55:20.483 --> 55:23.445
"I'll never get my girls back,"
and I think at that moment,

55:23.528 --> 55:24.988
we just say goodbye to Jeff.

55:25.071 --> 55:27.866
I think he's shooting up tomorrow
and dead in a week.

55:28.867 --> 55:32.203
That is a very realistic scenario here.

55:32.287 --> 55:35.957
The other part of that is
you put these girls in his hands...

55:36.041 --> 55:38.209
- I know.
- ...they're going to be dead, too.

55:38.543 --> 55:41.046
You're not looking... You gotta...

55:41.129 --> 55:46.634
We're looking at a menu
of shitty decisions and options,

55:46.718 --> 55:48.720
and not one of them is right.

55:49.429 --> 55:52.891
One of them has to be made,
but not one of them is good.

56:06.029 --> 56:08.615
All right, boys.
Come out wherever you are.

56:10.492 --> 56:14.788
I apologize to you guys
that I wasn't insightful enough

56:14.871 --> 56:16.873
to know this wasn't a good idea for you.

56:17.248 --> 56:19.793
I thought that even though
this wasn't finished,

56:19.876 --> 56:21.920
and it wasn't ready,
and we didn't have a manager,

56:22.295 --> 56:24.506
I thought that you guys had come so far,

56:24.589 --> 56:28.051
that this was going to work out
until we got it finished.

56:28.176 --> 56:31.012
So, you guys were at a disadvantage.

56:31.304 --> 56:34.391
Having said that,
you guys also fucked up.

56:35.433 --> 56:38.728
So we all share some responsibility
in what's going on here.

56:39.729 --> 56:43.566
We've got to figure out how can we make
you guys safe in your recovery.

56:44.109 --> 56:45.735
This place is obviously not it.

56:46.903 --> 56:49.572
So that leaves us with,
what are we gonna do next?

56:50.240 --> 56:53.243
Adam, I think, has already talked
with Craig about going to Minnesota

56:53.326 --> 56:55.286
and going to sober living out there,

56:55.370 --> 56:58.248
and I think that that would be
an appropriate option for him.

56:58.331 --> 57:00.125
Is that a plan you're willing to engage?

57:00.208 --> 57:01.084
-Yeah.
-Good.

57:01.668 --> 57:06.297
All right, Rush,
we would like to throw this out at you.

57:07.048 --> 57:10.385
The opportunity for you
to re-enter Jacob's Ladder

57:11.219 --> 57:12.804
and to start at the bottom

57:13.346 --> 57:14.973
and work the program again,

57:15.056 --> 57:17.559
then start working on yourself over,

57:18.268 --> 57:19.769
if you'd like to do that.

57:20.145 --> 57:21.312
Honestly, I feel...

57:22.313 --> 57:24.732
I feel better than I have been
in the past couple of weeks

57:24.816 --> 57:26.568
'cause I don't have to lie
about it anymore.

57:27.318 --> 57:31.197
I've never, ever stuck with it
and sat here through the consequences.

57:31.698 --> 57:33.199
I've always gone.

57:33.867 --> 57:35.869
I had money in my pocket, I still do,

57:36.244 --> 57:38.163
and my first instinct was to run.

57:38.371 --> 57:39.205
Yeah.

57:39.330 --> 57:42.000
But I didn't, and I think
that was a huge step for me.

57:42.083 --> 57:44.419
Like I told you yesterday,
I'm proud of you for that, man.

57:45.753 --> 57:47.172
That leaves us with Jeff.

57:50.049 --> 57:51.176
Yours is tough, man.

57:51.259 --> 57:52.427
Yours is tough because,

57:52.510 --> 57:57.474
honestly, the extent
of how far off track you went.

57:58.057 --> 58:00.101
I mean, it's the life you led before.

58:00.560 --> 58:02.979
The only difference is
you're not injecting yet.

58:03.438 --> 58:04.856
Breaking the law, lying,

58:05.356 --> 58:07.650
taking what you want when you want,
how you want.

58:08.735 --> 58:10.153
Your situation with your girls.

58:10.236 --> 58:14.741
I've already called Kristen Antolini,
and I asked her, "Is there any leeway?"

58:15.492 --> 58:16.743
She has to talk to the judge,

58:16.826 --> 58:20.455
but she thinks you could have
until mid-to-late January

58:21.247 --> 58:23.374
to stretch this out
and get yourself some help.

58:24.042 --> 58:26.127
Question is,
where are you going to get that help?

58:26.836 --> 58:28.087
What do you want, Jeff?

58:28.421 --> 58:29.255
Nothing.

58:30.131 --> 58:31.382
No help with us?

58:31.466 --> 58:33.801
-No help...
-I'm already fucked, dude.

58:35.178 --> 58:36.596
I just want my girls, dude.

58:37.305 --> 58:39.891
Drinking, you know what I mean,
fucked it all up.

58:40.808 --> 58:42.185
Now I ain't gonna get 'em.

58:43.811 --> 58:45.563
By the time I go there and get out,

58:46.105 --> 58:48.441
I ain't had no time to get on my feet,
get 'em home.

58:48.525 --> 58:49.943
It'll be over with, anyways.

58:50.527 --> 58:52.570
So I'm basically fucked all around,

58:53.238 --> 58:55.156
because I chose to drink a little bit.

58:55.823 --> 58:57.575
We've seen the best you and the worst,

58:57.659 --> 58:59.494
and right now,
it's like this "fuck it" Jeff.

58:59.577 --> 59:01.454
I don't say, "Fuck it," if I'm you.

59:02.038 --> 59:03.164
I say, "What do I do?"

59:03.873 --> 59:05.792
Do the next right thing
in front of my face

59:05.875 --> 59:11.422
and hope to God that somehow
that we can continue to work this.

59:13.341 --> 59:14.509
This is it, man.

59:16.469 --> 59:18.179
I mean, if you run away
from this right now,

59:18.263 --> 59:19.472
you're never getting them back.

59:19.806 --> 59:20.640
You know that.

59:43.121 --> 59:45.248
I'm tired of fucking moving.

59:52.755 --> 59:54.465
I know, Mom, but I'm a big boy.

59:54.591 --> 59:58.595
Sometimes I gotta go through
these struggles to get to the other side.

59:59.637 --> 01:00:02.390
I mean, I'm gonna try
to figure it out, Mom.

01:00:23.202 --> 01:00:26.122
Hey, man, what's up?
How you been, dude?

01:00:27.165 --> 01:00:31.085
I know drinking's a big fucking deal,
you know what I mean, but it's like...

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:34.714
I don't know.
I don't know how to say it the right way.

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:36.799
You shouldn't drink, yeah,
you shouldn't, you know?

01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:39.302
You shouldn't do stupid shit,
when you've been drinking...

01:00:39.385 --> 01:00:41.220
It's not like we went out
and banged dope,

01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:42.847
went back to the same old shit.

01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:46.601
Yeah, but if your life's become
unmanageable because of your drinking,

01:00:46.684 --> 01:00:49.062
even if it's just scheduling.

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:52.565
Even if it's just not being on time,
not being home for curfew.

01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:56.569
Even if none of the other shit happened,
drinking's making that shit happen,

01:00:56.694 --> 01:00:58.655
or partying, the lifestyle in general.

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:22.387
I moved back in with my mom
for a short period of time,

01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:25.390
and forgot about the Minneapolis thing.

01:01:25.973 --> 01:01:29.852
I called my boss and asked
if I can still have my job,

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:33.356
if I had transportation
and a place to stay out here,

01:01:33.439 --> 01:01:36.734
and he said,
"Yeah, get your ass back to work Monday.

01:01:36.818 --> 01:01:38.027
I'll see you then."

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.613
My decision was made right then.

01:01:42.323 --> 01:01:43.866
Paying the bills and I like it.

01:01:46.244 --> 01:01:47.161
Here, cows.

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:51.749
Come on, come here.

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:54.293
-Good girl.
-Come here!

01:01:55.336 --> 01:01:56.337
Yep, yep!

01:02:12.019 --> 01:02:14.147
It's the hardest I've ever worked before.

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:16.899
I don't know what to do.

01:02:17.525 --> 01:02:19.986
I'm lost in my own little world.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.322
But I'll figure it out eventually.

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:26.993
God, grant us the serenity

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:32.457
to accept the things we cannot change,
the courage to change the things we can,

01:02:32.832 --> 01:02:34.959
and the wisdom to know the difference.

01:02:35.042 --> 01:02:38.087
Just for you today, I've asked
a friend to read "The 12 Steps."

01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:39.380
I'm Rush and I'm an addict.

01:02:39.464 --> 01:02:40.715
Hi, Rush.

01:02:40.798 --> 01:02:42.884
One, we admitted we were powerless
over our addiction,

01:02:42.967 --> 01:02:44.343
our lives have become unmanageable.

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.512
Two, came to believe
a power greater than ourselves

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:47.638
could restore us to sanity.

01:02:47.722 --> 01:02:49.766
Eight, we made a list of all persons
we had harmed,

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:51.893
and became willing
to make amends to them all.

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:54.896
Nine, we made direct amends
to such people wherever possible,

01:02:54.979 --> 01:02:56.898
except when to do so
would injure them or others.

01:02:58.024 --> 01:02:59.692
Give me that. You don't need it.

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:01.944
I don't care. You don't get no more.

01:03:07.533 --> 01:03:09.035
No, you've had enough.

01:03:09.702 --> 01:03:12.079
You done spilled it everywhere.
You ain't getting no more.

01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:14.707
-I'll shut it.
-I don't care what you're gonna do.

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:22.548
-Making a train track.
-Don't! Quit!

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:27.094
I just want more water!

01:03:27.178 --> 01:03:28.846
-No you won't. I'll do it. Go!
-No!

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:35.019
I'm nowhere near ready for this.
I'm not.

01:03:38.105 --> 01:03:39.106
- Yuck.
- Here.

01:03:39.732 --> 01:03:41.234
Then don't eat nothing at all.

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:44.445
You don't get to pick what you want.

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:49.033
I was finishing drywall, and my boss
shows up and I have a kid here.

01:03:49.116 --> 01:03:51.786
He's like, "You going to work?"
I said, "I have nobody to watch her."

01:03:52.245 --> 01:03:54.539
And he's basically told me
he don't need me.

01:03:55.122 --> 01:03:56.624
He slammed his door and left.

01:03:58.543 --> 01:04:00.336
I need to get out of this town, man.

01:04:00.795 --> 01:04:02.255
They're in a good home here.

01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:05.049
They got a roof over their head,
transportation.

01:04:05.132 --> 01:04:06.717
Someone feeds them, loves them.

01:04:07.051 --> 01:04:07.885
You know?

01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:10.304
I don't got none of that right now.

01:04:10.638 --> 01:04:12.473
I got the love, but that's about it.

01:04:12.557 --> 01:04:14.433
You know? So...

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:17.770
I thought more about getting high
this past day

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:20.940
than I have since I've been out
of Jacob's Ladder.

01:04:30.575 --> 01:04:31.784
This the love shack?

01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:41.627
Yeah, let's shut this door.

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:45.631
My heat is so expensive,
it's unbelievable.

01:04:55.016 --> 01:04:59.061
Ten days from now marks my one year
that I was in jail.

01:04:59.145 --> 01:05:01.022
I went to jail ten days from today...

01:05:01.105 --> 01:05:02.440
Mm-hmm.

01:05:02.523 --> 01:05:05.401
...so it's like,
my life is completely flipped around.

01:05:05.484 --> 01:05:07.737
-Yeah.
-I mean, I was homeless, man.

01:05:07.862 --> 01:05:11.657
I've been around the addiction world
for a while, and...

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:16.078
You know, I did notice
that you look skinnier now.

01:05:16.829 --> 01:05:17.914
You know what I mean?

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:20.708
I'm pretty fit right now.

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:23.836
You know what I mean?
I can run up nine flights of stairs.

01:05:24.712 --> 01:05:26.839
I don't know.
I just want to live my life.

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:28.424
You know, and I have, like...

01:05:29.383 --> 01:05:33.679
people showing up at my house asking me
to come back to Jacob's Ladder,

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:36.766
because, you know,
I failed a drug test for weed,

01:05:36.849 --> 01:05:38.601
and it's like, dude...

01:05:38.809 --> 01:05:42.313
so I should never have bought that car
from Jacob's Ladder.

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:45.566
Did you all make an agreement?
On taking piss tests

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:47.944
with the vehicle and stuff,
since he financed it for you?

01:05:48.027 --> 01:05:51.530
He made me sign a contract that said
I had to piss anytime he wants me

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:53.616
for the next fucking two years.

01:05:53.699 --> 01:05:55.534
Who does that? For a car?

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:58.079
-You're talking about Kevin?
-Yeah.

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:02.959
So, he's like, "You failed this drug test.
We can't let you keep the jeep."

01:06:03.584 --> 01:06:05.586
Bro, you did drugs,
you know what I'm saying?

01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:08.422
Like, take responsibility
for what you did.

01:06:09.882 --> 01:06:12.009
No, that's not it.

01:06:12.593 --> 01:06:13.803
That's not it, bro.

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:17.348
I don't know what to say, man.

01:06:17.431 --> 01:06:18.975
I just want to live my life.

01:06:20.101 --> 01:06:21.060
It's all good, man.

01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:26.399
I'll tell you what, there is fucking
nothing to do up here, though.

01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:28.859
Yeah, I've noticed that.

01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:32.905
That Xbox probably has, like,
a billion hours on it right now.

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:34.490
Yeah.

01:06:35.408 --> 01:06:37.284
All right, brother,
I'm gonna hit the road.

01:06:37.368 --> 01:06:38.661
-All right, man.
-Love you, dude.

01:06:38.744 --> 01:06:39.578
Love you, too.

01:06:40.204 --> 01:06:42.957
I'm always here for you, man.
If you ever need anything,

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:46.002
-just hit me up.
-I got your number.

01:07:06.397 --> 01:07:08.357
If you need medicine right now...

01:07:11.068 --> 01:07:11.902
Cuckoo pill.

01:07:11.986 --> 01:07:14.905
The addict's favorite part of the day.
It's medicine time.

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:16.907
Rush, is this all you're taking?
Just one?

01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:19.910
-Yeah.
-"Take half a tablet daily."

01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:22.079
Yep. I'm just on half a tablet.

01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:26.125
-Are these half tablets?
-No, you have to cut it in half.

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:30.296
I started depression medication.
Zoloft, I think it's Zoloft.

01:07:30.379 --> 01:07:31.338
Something with a Z.

01:07:32.423 --> 01:07:35.885
So I got on the antidepressants,
'cause, like, there was no...

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:38.763
It was going up, it was going down.
You know, normal fluctuation.

01:07:38.846 --> 01:07:39.847
It was just like...

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:42.767
I just couldn't handle it anymore.

01:07:43.684 --> 01:07:47.313
I had, like, really bad thoughts,
homicidal, suicidal.

01:07:48.189 --> 01:07:50.733
I was diagnosed with clinical depression
when I was really young,

01:07:50.816 --> 01:07:54.320
but I never really took medication.
I self-medicated instead, so...

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:59.241
Now I'm like, "What do I do?"
I can't self-medicate, so...

01:07:59.825 --> 01:08:03.120
I was like, "Sign me up for something,
see how it works."

01:08:03.871 --> 01:08:06.373
I'm just glad I'm not lost,
and I'm still found.

01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:10.920
No one's heard from Jeff, really,
so that scares me.

01:08:11.253 --> 01:08:13.506
I heard he missed a pee test.

01:08:13.798 --> 01:08:16.801
So I don't know what's gonna happen,
what's going on.

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:35.528

Message MO 22.

01:09:04.098 --> 01:09:04.974
Hi.

01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:12.356
You gotta walk...

01:09:13.858 --> 01:09:16.068
-You're on...
-Thin ice, yeah, I know.

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:17.069
Yeah, so...

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:18.444
All rise.

01:09:19.572 --> 01:09:20.781
You may be seated.

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:25.786
He is in agreement
that he made some bad choices,

01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:28.163
and I think the short of it is that...

01:09:28.788 --> 01:09:31.876
because he made a few bad choices,
he got scared,

01:09:31.959 --> 01:09:34.211
and instead of reaching out to help
from me,

01:09:34.295 --> 01:09:36.714
instead of reaching out to help
from probation,

01:09:36.796 --> 01:09:39.758
he just stopped having contact
with all of us.

01:09:40.718 --> 01:09:42.761
So you have something you wish to say?

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:46.849
I just want to apologize to the court
for my behavior,

01:09:46.932 --> 01:09:49.393
the way I acted out. I got scared.

01:09:49.894 --> 01:09:53.229
I apologize to my probation officer
for not keeping in contact.

01:09:53.772 --> 01:09:56.650
I feel like I let everybody down,
and I truly am sorry.

01:09:57.067 --> 01:09:59.945
I'd like to have one more chance
at this probation.

01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:06.327
Would you prefer being in prison,
or would you prefer probation?

01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:09.663
Your Honor, I prefer probation.
I don't wanna go to prison.

01:10:09.747 --> 01:10:11.207
Well, you have to follow my orders.

01:10:11.415 --> 01:10:13.083
I definitely don't wanna go to prison.

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:18.339
-Listen, these are serious charges.
-Yes, sir.

01:10:18.422 --> 01:10:21.133
Now, if you like hanging out
with other prisoners,

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:23.135
we can make that arrangement for you.

01:10:24.553 --> 01:10:26.680
-Do you understand that?
-Yes, Your Honor.

01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:31.060
I can go pee today if you like me to.

01:10:31.143 --> 01:10:33.395
All right, I'm going to grant probation.

01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:35.481
I'm going to sanction you for 30 days.

01:10:36.315 --> 01:10:37.191
Yes, sir.

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:40.319
- All right. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:10:51.872 --> 01:10:54.458
-What about  Mad TV?
-Did you see that Sean Spicer stuff?

01:10:54.541 --> 01:10:56.961
Did I see it? No, Jack, I'm in rehab.
I didn't fucking see it.

01:10:57.044 --> 01:10:58.420
-I saw it.
-I'mma send that to you.

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:02.383
Look, this gray hair on my head,
I named it Adam.

01:11:02.466 --> 01:11:05.135
-You gonna pull it out?
-You know how many gray hairs I have?

01:11:05.219 --> 01:11:07.638
I get a call, and it was Adam,

01:11:07.721 --> 01:11:10.724
and he just opened up
and he said he's been doing heroin,

01:11:10.808 --> 01:11:13.060
and didn't wanna...

01:11:14.478 --> 01:11:16.272
Didn't wanna keep going that way.

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:20.150
You know, had a friend that had
passed away due to an overdose,

01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:22.695
and he just didn't know what to do.

01:11:23.487 --> 01:11:24.613
So I brought him back.

01:11:25.155 --> 01:11:25.990
What's up, man?

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:29.159
How are you doing, bro?

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:30.953
-Been better.
-Well, you're here.

01:11:31.036 --> 01:11:33.998
-Pretty cold right now.
-Welcome home.

01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:37.167
Thanks.
I appreciate you taking me back, man.

01:11:37.251 --> 01:11:41.130
I told you we'd be here for you.
We're always here for you.

01:11:41.255 --> 01:11:44.008
It doesn't always work first time
down the path, man.

01:11:44.091 --> 01:11:45.092
No, no.

01:11:45.175 --> 01:11:46.635
Ask all these guys, man.

01:11:46.719 --> 01:11:48.971
I think I just had the wrong ideas.

01:11:49.596 --> 01:11:53.058
Probably should've stuck around here.
Not the best idea.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:55.060
Definitely shouldn't have gone back
to Wheeling.

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:57.563
No, shouldn't have gone back to Wheeling.

01:11:57.646 --> 01:12:00.274
Shouldn't have took that job, either.

01:12:00.399 --> 01:12:02.901
It was just all drugs and bullshit.

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:09.325
You knew that, but sometimes,
you gotta learn the hard way.

01:12:09.408 --> 01:12:11.118
Yeah, I just had to trial by fire.

01:12:11.201 --> 01:12:13.620
Fortunately,
the fire didn't burn you all the way.

01:12:13.704 --> 01:12:14.872
No, it did not.

01:12:16.373 --> 01:12:19.418
It scorched you. Well, we'll get you out.

01:12:25.215 --> 01:12:27.301
Sunday I was at the house,

01:12:27.384 --> 01:12:32.639
and I get a text message saying,
"Adam has left Jacob's Ladder."

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:36.101
He was adamant,
said his mind was made up.

01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:40.856
He did not want to go through detox,

01:12:41.648 --> 01:12:45.027
and he said, "I appreciate the offer
to come back here,

01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:48.822
but I'm just not ready
to quit getting high,"

01:12:49.448 --> 01:12:52.743
and he just packed his bags, walked out.

01:13:20.604 --> 01:13:23.232
I was dope sick,
and I was there for two nights.

01:13:23.315 --> 01:13:27.194
I couldn't sleep at all,
and I felt like I didn't give a fuck.

01:13:28.695 --> 01:13:30.447
I don't know, heroin,

01:13:30.781 --> 01:13:32.491
it's just a whole 'nother level.

01:13:33.951 --> 01:13:37.371
Unless, and I'm not ever condoning
somebody gotta try it,

01:13:37.454 --> 01:13:38.997
but if you try it, you know...

01:13:40.374 --> 01:13:41.542
you're gonna like it.

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:43.127
It's heroin.

01:13:44.169 --> 01:13:47.506
It's the worst drug on the planet,
because it's so good.

01:13:47.589 --> 01:13:51.093
You know, people don't get addicted
to heroin because it sucks.

01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:56.807
You know, my mom, like, hates me
being here.

01:13:56.890 --> 01:13:58.976
You know, when she found out I was using,

01:13:59.810 --> 01:14:00.936
it broke her heart.

01:14:05.983 --> 01:14:07.526
How do you feel right now?

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.488
Depressed.

01:14:14.074 --> 01:14:15.742
I watch a lot of TV.

01:14:17.161 --> 01:14:18.620
Watch a lot of TV.

01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:21.874
Have you guys seen  Fear the Walking Dead?

01:14:22.499 --> 01:14:24.084
It's a good TV show.

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:40.767
I don't know what I'm doing.
I'm just winging it.

01:14:42.436 --> 01:14:43.812
'Cause it's all brand new again.

01:14:44.646 --> 01:14:46.523
I feel like it hasn't changed.

01:14:47.024 --> 01:14:50.110
I feel like I'm right back
where I was a year and a half ago.

01:14:51.069 --> 01:14:53.655
Like, what do you do?
Do you throw him out on the street?

01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:55.115
I did that. It didn't work.

01:14:55.782 --> 01:14:59.244
Made me worry even more,
thought I was gonna get the phone call,

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:01.455
you know, that he was found
under the bridge, or...

01:15:02.873 --> 01:15:04.416
that he was arrested.

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:06.001
I need a tissue.

01:15:07.002 --> 01:15:10.172
So I don't think I'm gonna go that route,
unless I'm forced to

01:15:10.255 --> 01:15:14.551
by whatever actions, you know,
Adam takes.

01:15:15.093 --> 01:15:18.263
That's gonna be kinda the deciding point
with that, you know?

01:15:18.472 --> 01:15:21.183
I mean, obviously if I come home,
and my belongings...

01:15:21.266 --> 01:15:23.435
If I have to buy this damn television
for a fourth time,

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:25.979
I'm gonna be really pissed.

01:15:26.104 --> 01:15:28.148
I've already bought
my own television three times.

01:15:30.609 --> 01:15:32.110
He had it all three weeks ago.

01:15:32.986 --> 01:15:36.490
His own house, his own vehicle,
good job, making good money.

01:15:36.782 --> 01:15:38.408
Maybe it was too much too fast.

01:15:39.785 --> 01:15:40.702
What do you think?

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:42.454
I don't know.

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:43.997
I don't know what I want.

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.336
As you can see,

01:15:50.587 --> 01:15:54.341
you know, things are very far
from perfect in my life.

01:15:57.261 --> 01:15:59.471
But you can't get help until you want it.

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:03.308
He's gotta make up his mind.

01:16:05.602 --> 01:16:06.603
It's very sad.

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:26.999
Last one.

01:16:27.165 --> 01:16:30.085
Rush, you're like my mother times four.

01:16:33.714 --> 01:16:34.548
Day one.

01:16:37.467 --> 01:16:39.970
- Yeah, I only need this much space.
- Okay.

01:16:40.053 --> 01:16:42.848
-All that hanging space.
-Books. I have a library.

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:46.268
We have a requirement here.
You go to five meetings a week.

01:16:46.351 --> 01:16:48.770
That can be AA or NA.

01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:51.064
We have two in-house meetings a week.

01:16:51.315 --> 01:16:53.859
Everybody in the house participates
in a service activity

01:16:53.942 --> 01:16:55.444
in the community once a month.

01:16:55.777 --> 01:16:57.321
We have a curfew here.

01:16:57.696 --> 01:16:59.823
I still want that accountability,
you know?

01:17:00.157 --> 01:17:03.452
I wanna be sure
that when I do integrate into society

01:17:03.535 --> 01:17:05.912
from this next stepping stone,
Morgantown Sober Living,

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:08.665
that I will have what I need
to succeed in life

01:17:08.749 --> 01:17:11.084
outside of a recovery house
or a rehab,

01:17:11.793 --> 01:17:13.128
and this is where I need to be.

01:17:22.512 --> 01:17:24.514
-Thank you.
-Yeah, anything else?

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.516
-No, I think that's it.
-Okay.

01:17:50.457 --> 01:17:52.709
Okay, welcome to the Friendship House.

01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:55.587
This is the 10:00 a.m.
substance abuse group.

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:58.924
The topic for discussion today is
chemical dependency,

01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:01.510
but we can also talk
about recovery in any form.

01:18:01.593 --> 01:18:02.427
I'm Ryan.

01:18:04.554 --> 01:18:06.098
-I'm Pam.
-Hey, Pam.

01:18:06.181 --> 01:18:07.474
-I'm Sean.
-Hey, Sean.

01:18:07.557 --> 01:18:08.725
-I'm Heather.
-Heather.

01:18:08.809 --> 01:18:09.893
-I'm Stephen.
-Hey, Stephen.

01:18:10.268 --> 01:18:13.063
So if there's problems you want
to discuss and overcome,

01:18:13.146 --> 01:18:15.440
we're here to help you.
You're not gonna get judged by me.

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:19.152
You're not gonna get judged by Keith.
A lot of us struggle the same way.

01:18:19.236 --> 01:18:21.822
- Today would have been 47 days.
- That's great.

01:18:21.947 --> 01:18:25.200
But I kinda went back one day.

01:18:25.283 --> 01:18:26.993
-You slipped?
-I slipped.

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:29.830
I mean, did something happen
when you had your slip though,

01:18:29.913 --> 01:18:31.498
or the next day, you were like,

01:18:31.581 --> 01:18:34.292
"Oh, I shouldn't have drank,
because this happened"?

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:36.837
When my brain starts going
a million miles an hour,

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:38.505
it just doesn't function right.

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:41.216
Don't be living in that shame and guilt,

01:18:41.299 --> 01:18:43.343
'cause today you're here,
and you're in group,

01:18:43.427 --> 01:18:45.721
and you're not drunk,
and that's a big deal.

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:48.849
There's a lot of different aspects
to recovery.

01:18:49.182 --> 01:18:52.769
It's like you wanna pick and choose
what you wanna do and not do.

01:18:53.103 --> 01:18:55.313
You tell me.
Take what you want and leave the rest.

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:56.356
I know that's true.

01:18:57.566 --> 01:18:58.400
Exactly.

01:18:58.567 --> 01:19:01.069
So we can do wellness plans
after group.

01:19:01.653 --> 01:19:04.281
Any goal you have that relates
to your physical,

01:19:04.364 --> 01:19:06.158
mental or spiritual well-being,

01:19:07.868 --> 01:19:09.953
we're willing to help with, so...

01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:26.803
Rush, man.

01:19:28.013 --> 01:19:29.973
- Rush, you look good, buddy.
- Thanks, man.

01:19:30.056 --> 01:19:31.391
-I like your hair.
-Thank you.

01:19:31.725 --> 01:19:33.769
- I just did it up.
- You look amazing.

01:19:33.852 --> 01:19:34.686
Thank you.

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:35.937
-Workin' out?
-Nope.

01:19:36.104 --> 01:19:37.522
-What's up?
-What's up, man?

01:19:38.148 --> 01:19:39.232
Oh, my God.

01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:41.109
I thought we were early.

01:19:41.902 --> 01:19:43.904
-Be careful, man.
-It's not gonna be "Kumbaya."

01:19:44.029 --> 01:19:45.071
Come on, "Kumbaya."

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:48.658
Are we gonna do
campfire funny songs again?

01:20:54.266 --> 01:20:57.519
- I have to have metatarsal boots tomorrow.
- Mm-hmm.

01:20:57.602 --> 01:20:59.729
If you want to go down with me

01:21:00.313 --> 01:21:02.774
and help me buy them
or something like that...

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:06.319
That's fine. I'd much rather buy
your boots than give you money.

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:07.821
-Okay.
-I mean...

01:21:08.572 --> 01:21:13.118
I'm starting a new job tomorrow.
Got another fabricator position.

01:21:13.201 --> 01:21:15.245
Starts out 13 bucks an hour.

01:21:16.079 --> 01:21:17.789
I'm hopeful.

01:21:18.415 --> 01:21:20.917
He's back on the Suboxone.
Did good at the clinic.

01:21:22.586 --> 01:21:23.503
That's a good thing.

01:21:23.587 --> 01:21:25.714
I'd rather him be under supervision

01:21:27.382 --> 01:21:30.260
with the Suboxone
than out doing heroin.

01:21:30.343 --> 01:21:32.387
So, you know,
it's the lesser of two evils.

01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:33.680
Seems to be doing okay on it.

01:21:34.681 --> 01:21:37.601
He looks better, doesn't have
the big black circles under his eyes,

01:21:37.684 --> 01:21:39.686
isn't passing out mid-sentence.

01:21:39.978 --> 01:21:42.230
-Those kind of things.
-I wasn't passing out mid-sentence.

01:21:42.314 --> 01:21:44.733
-Maybe I was.
-Yeah, you were. You were.

01:21:46.151 --> 01:21:48.236
But I think he's doing pretty good.

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:50.071
This week, we're on the right track.

01:21:50.155 --> 01:21:52.449
Yeah, this week.
We'll see about next week.

01:21:53.992 --> 01:21:56.161
That's like I said,
I'm hopefully optimistic.

01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:59.080
Cautiously optimistic may be
a better way to put it.

01:22:10.508 --> 01:22:12.469
Yeah, these are it, right here, too.

01:22:21.394 --> 01:22:25.106
We don't know where he's living,
where he's going.

01:22:27.067 --> 01:22:29.235
So technically,
only people he has that live here

01:22:29.319 --> 01:22:32.113
are his sister and ex-wife
and her family?

01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:35.784
-Yes.
-And they're with her parents, the kids?

01:22:35.867 --> 01:22:36.701
Her mom.

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:38.203
Poor kids.

01:22:39.329 --> 01:22:40.330
Wow.

01:22:40.747 --> 01:22:43.500
It's awful how they just, like,
let people be released.

01:22:44.584 --> 01:22:46.962
I don't know how people are supposed
to get on a good footing

01:22:47.045 --> 01:22:50.006
and follow rules of probation
when they don't have any resources,

01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:52.133
and they're just released
to North Central.

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:54.594
-What's going on, man?
-Hey.

01:22:54.678 --> 01:22:56.096
-How are you doing?
-Good.

01:22:56.179 --> 01:22:57.222
-How are you?
-Good.

01:22:57.555 --> 01:22:58.598
-Hey, man.
-What's up?

01:22:58.682 --> 01:23:00.600
- How are you?
- What is the plan?

01:23:00.684 --> 01:23:03.770
What is your ultimate plan right now?
'Cause we have nothing.

01:23:05.855 --> 01:23:07.774
I just want to get out of town, man.

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:10.652
-Not gonna let you.
-Then I don't have a plan.

01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:11.820
We can't have that.

01:23:12.487 --> 01:23:15.907
- Well, when you leave here...
- I can't be in Morgantown.

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:18.618
Morgantown's a bad place for me.

01:23:18.702 --> 01:23:21.329
You are going to have to be
in Morgantown right now,

01:23:21.413 --> 01:23:25.083
and when you leave here, you need
to go directly to the Bartlett House,

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:26.876
make sure you got somewhere
to stay tonight,

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:29.462
then you gotta hit the ground running,
trying to find employment.

01:23:30.422 --> 01:23:33.299
I'm a three-time felon. You know
how hard it is to get a job, man?

01:23:33.383 --> 01:23:37.137
I put in every fast food restaurant,
from Sabraton to Star City last time.

01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:38.471
No one would take me.

01:23:39.055 --> 01:23:40.306
You gotta look at it.

01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:43.059
You pretty much fumbled the ball.

01:23:43.143 --> 01:23:45.770
-You're in the situation you are.
-Mm-hmm.

01:23:46.354 --> 01:23:48.732
Your wife is in the situation she's in.

01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:51.693
Pretty much your kids are just in limbo.

01:23:51.776 --> 01:23:54.654
Right now, neither one of you guys
are batting 100,

01:23:55.447 --> 01:23:57.824
so what is our treatment plan
for you gonna be?

01:23:57.907 --> 01:24:00.368
-Going to NA meetings?
-Yeah, definitely.

01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:04.247
Do not consume any intoxicants.
No liquor, no synthetic drugs.

01:24:04.330 --> 01:24:06.541
No K2, no bath salts.

01:24:07.125 --> 01:24:09.461
No prescriptions not of yours.

01:24:09.544 --> 01:24:12.756
If you decided you want
to get on Subutex or Suboxone,

01:24:12.839 --> 01:24:14.424
Subutex is no longer allowed...

01:24:14.758 --> 01:24:17.135
Setting up for failure,
you know what I mean?

01:24:17.635 --> 01:24:20.138
I can't be in this town, dude.

01:24:20.972 --> 01:24:21.973
I can't do it.

01:24:24.559 --> 01:24:26.770
It's your brother Jeff.
I just got out today.

01:24:26.853 --> 01:24:29.314
I thought I could get out tomorrow,
but it's today.

01:24:30.815 --> 01:24:32.317
Yeah, I don't know what to do.

01:24:33.568 --> 01:24:36.613
They want me to stay at Bartlett House,
but I ain't about to do that.

01:24:37.113 --> 01:24:39.741
They're nothing but drug addicts there.
Homeless drug addicts.

01:24:39.824 --> 01:24:41.451
Why do I want to stay there?

01:25:01.679 --> 01:25:03.473
Hey, Chad, this is Jeff.

01:25:04.349 --> 01:25:07.060
I thought about coming back
to Jacob's Ladder.

01:25:07.435 --> 01:25:08.645
I need it, dude.

01:25:09.896 --> 01:25:11.439
My life's getting out of hand.

01:25:13.191 --> 01:25:16.444
I just messed up
and did a line of cocaine today.

01:25:20.448 --> 01:25:21.741
What's this life for?

01:25:26.579 --> 01:25:27.497
Give me a call.

01:25:28.081 --> 01:25:30.041
Love you, bro. Goodbye.

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:37.298
Old Dad's back.

01:25:44.055 --> 01:25:45.098
Jeff.

01:25:48.768 --> 01:25:51.479
What's up, brother? How you doing?

01:25:52.188 --> 01:25:53.606
-Doing better.
-Yeah?

01:25:54.649 --> 01:25:56.025
We're happy you're alive,

01:25:56.109 --> 01:26:00.321
'cause Friday night,
if it hadn't been for that person,

01:26:01.072 --> 01:26:04.492
the random person who is unnamed
that was driving by,

01:26:04.617 --> 01:26:07.912
that saw the people that you were
using with pouring water on your face,

01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:10.790
smacking you and shaking you,
who knows if they would have called EMS?

01:26:10.874 --> 01:26:13.042
But that one person called the EMS.

01:26:13.459 --> 01:26:15.420
So your hero's out there, man.

01:26:16.504 --> 01:26:19.215
A random person drove by
and saw you needed help and made a call.

01:26:19.299 --> 01:26:20.717
They didn't have to do that.

01:26:21.593 --> 01:26:23.428
You could just be
another drug addict dead.

01:26:24.596 --> 01:26:27.182
You know,
people on Facebook saying, "Let him die."
