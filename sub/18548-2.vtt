00:34.340 --> 00:36.100
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Argh!

01:05.462 --> 01:07.539
Sorry, Aunt Flis,
I didn't mean to scare you.

01:07.555 --> 01:10.035
By breaking into my bedroom
in the middle of the night?!

01:10.060 --> 01:11.751
I thought I'd slip in quietly.

01:11.788 --> 01:14.748
I'm on the run, you see, and I
didn't want to wake the servants.

01:14.820 --> 01:16.739
Well, that went to plan(!)

01:16.740 --> 01:18.540
It's only Miss Bunty.

01:18.580 --> 01:21.580
Hello, Hornby.
Sorry for all the kerfuffle.

01:21.620 --> 01:22.900
Hello, Miss Bunty.

01:22.940 --> 01:25.260
Please go back to bed.
I'll deal with this.

01:26.700 --> 01:28.979
Now, what have you done?

01:28.980 --> 01:32.099
Well, a photographer from The Post
snapped me leaving the Night Bunker.

01:32.100 --> 01:33.380
The Night Bunker?!

01:33.420 --> 01:36.379
Ghastly, I know, but sleazy
is all the rage.

01:36.380 --> 01:38.620
What's worse is that I was with
Tony Hartley,

01:38.660 --> 01:40.619
and now his wife is citing me
in the divorce.

01:40.620 --> 01:41.980
Oh, Bunty!

01:42.020 --> 01:44.499
Oh, it's a fearful stink, I know.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.219
Daddy's on the warpath
and, um... I was thinking

01:47.220 --> 01:49.820
I need a place to lay low
until he calms down.

01:49.860 --> 01:52.460
And where better than
with my favourite aunt?

01:52.500 --> 01:54.460
Mm-hm.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.860
Play your cards right,
you can be mistress of all this.

02:20.660 --> 02:25.980
Eeh, Lady Davina.
How lovely to see you.

02:26.020 --> 02:27.620
Mr Vanderlande.

02:28.700 --> 02:30.500
Do come in. Thank you.

02:33.180 --> 02:36.540
Yes, Dickie, she WILL hate it,
but that's rather the point.

02:41.260 --> 02:43.260
Well, I'm glad that's settled.

02:43.300 --> 02:45.140
Goodbye, Dickie.

02:48.860 --> 02:50.380
PHONE RINGS

02:53.020 --> 02:54.460
Felicia Montague.

02:58.540 --> 03:00.020
Tonight?

03:02.780 --> 03:04.540
Yes, of course.

03:04.580 --> 03:07.220
So it's the Mother's Union at 11,

03:07.260 --> 03:09.660
followed by the
first Holy Communicants,

03:09.700 --> 03:13.339
and then after lunch
the Wayward Girls.

03:13.340 --> 03:16.340
Ooh, and I said we'd call in on
Lady Davina,

03:16.380 --> 03:19.020
see how Ruby Jewel is faring.

03:19.060 --> 03:21.420
The baby went to a nice family
in Guildford.

03:23.300 --> 03:26.299
I wonder how Ruby will cope
with Malmort.

03:26.300 --> 03:27.740
Oh, it's a grim old place,

03:27.780 --> 03:30.939
but, then,
we're not exactly spoilt for choice.

03:30.940 --> 03:34.259
Not many are keen to take on
girls of loose morals.

03:34.260 --> 03:36.139
Coo-ee!

03:36.140 --> 03:38.779
I wonder if I might beg a favour?

03:38.780 --> 03:42.980
My niece is staying and I wondered
if you'd help babysit.

03:43.020 --> 03:45.540
Babysit? Mm. Oh, how lovely!

03:45.580 --> 03:47.820
It would be our pleasure.
How old is she?

03:51.180 --> 03:52.540
25.

04:01.900 --> 04:03.620
Best behaviour, now.

04:03.660 --> 04:07.899
Davina! I don't think
you've met my niece, Bunty.

04:07.900 --> 04:09.939
How do you do, Lady Malmort?

04:09.940 --> 04:12.020
Dickie Windermere's girl.

04:12.060 --> 04:15.180
I know you by, er... reputation.

04:15.220 --> 04:17.740
Ah! And here is Smith.

04:19.380 --> 04:22.780
Oh! And how are you settling in,
child?

04:22.820 --> 04:25.220
Very grateful to Her Ladyship
for the opportunity.

04:27.460 --> 04:30.100
I spy my house guests.

04:30.140 --> 04:33.100
Will you excuse me
while I fetch them for tea?

04:33.140 --> 04:35.380
Anyone I know? Oh, hardly.

04:35.420 --> 04:37.780
Just Norman Vanderlande -

04:37.820 --> 04:41.060
common as muck, but rich as Croesus
- and his daughter, Joan.

04:41.100 --> 04:45.420
A milksop, but, thankfully,
educated, as I intend her for Bobby.

04:45.460 --> 04:49.580
An arranged marriage?
How very Victorian.

04:49.620 --> 04:52.819
Unfortunately,
not all of us are in a position

04:52.820 --> 04:54.980
where we turn our noses up at trade!

05:03.540 --> 05:05.019
Smith?

05:05.020 --> 05:07.316
She said Ruby Jewel was an
unsuitable name for a housemaid.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.700
And while I'm here
I'd be known as Smith.

05:10.940 --> 05:14.220
And I'll tell you, Father,
this place gives me the creeps.

05:14.260 --> 05:16.339
It is a bit Gormenghast.

05:16.340 --> 05:19.140
Nonsense, Penelope.
It's a fresh start.

05:19.180 --> 05:21.299
A chance to put the past behind you.

05:21.300 --> 05:23.300
Huh! There's no such thing.

05:26.420 --> 05:28.860
You never know who'll come
crawling out of the woodwork.

05:38.420 --> 05:40.380
You were supposed to be here
for lunch!

05:40.420 --> 05:42.179
I was unavoidably detained.

05:42.180 --> 05:43.620
In an all-night drinking den?

05:43.660 --> 05:46.500
I am warning you, Bobby,
do NOT embarrass me!

05:46.540 --> 05:50.500
Mr Vanderlande! Sincere apologies
for my tardy arrival.

05:50.540 --> 05:54.180
And Miss Vanderlande.
Delighted to see you again.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.379
Why all the formality?

05:56.380 --> 05:59.219
I think you'll find she answers
to "Joan".

05:59.220 --> 06:01.140
Davina, we'll leave you
to your guests.

06:01.180 --> 06:03.820
Bunty Windermere,
what are you doing in the sticks?!

06:03.860 --> 06:07.459
Bobby! Time for bad behaviour.
I could ask you the same thing!

06:07.460 --> 06:09.420
Long story. We must catch up. Yes!

06:09.460 --> 06:12.419
Well, sadly, Miss Windermere
is just leaving.

06:12.420 --> 06:15.260
Then she must return for dinner,
as she's in the area.

06:16.580 --> 06:19.780
Of course. You are BOTH
more than welcome.

06:19.820 --> 06:23.140
I'm so sorry, I have an engagement
in London.

06:23.180 --> 06:25.459
But if you need someone to make up
numbers,

06:25.460 --> 06:28.939
I can attest to Father Brown's
attributes as a dinner guest.

06:28.940 --> 06:33.980
Well, in that case, Father,
can I persuade you to join us?

06:36.260 --> 06:38.260
It would be my pleasure.

06:38.300 --> 06:41.740
Well, that's settled, then.
Shall we?

06:41.780 --> 06:44.380
Mr Van... Norman.

06:52.620 --> 06:55.340
That's the first I heard of
this trip to London.

06:55.380 --> 06:57.179
It... It's all very last-minute.

06:57.180 --> 06:59.380
That means you're going to miss
the summer fete meeting.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.180
Well, I'm sure you can cover for me.

07:01.220 --> 07:03.660
And what is so important that you
have to go rushing off

07:03.700 --> 07:05.300
without so much as a by-your-leave?

07:05.340 --> 07:07.940
It's boring.
Nothing that would interest you.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.700
Ah, here you are. Good.

07:20.740 --> 07:23.539
Ship-shape and Bristol.
I know what you're doing.

07:23.540 --> 07:26.339
Turning up drunk,
inviting the Windermere girl.

07:26.340 --> 07:29.460
Whatever it is you've got planned,
you can forget it.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.099
This was your grandmother's.

07:31.100 --> 07:33.540
Seven carats and hideously ugly,

07:33.580 --> 07:36.180
so no doubt it will impress
Norman Vanderlande.

07:37.820 --> 07:39.820
You've only got yourself to blame.

07:39.860 --> 07:43.899
Who was it who gambled
and drank away a fortune

07:43.900 --> 07:46.540
and then rendered
himself unmarriageable

07:46.580 --> 07:48.420
to any woman of breeding?!

07:48.460 --> 07:50.700
How can I forget,
as you remind me so often?

07:50.740 --> 07:52.420
So you WILL behave.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.460
And propose to the girl.

07:56.500 --> 08:01.899
Or you will go down as the man
that let this family go to ruin.

08:01.900 --> 08:04.179
Anything for you, dear Mother.

08:04.180 --> 08:08.260
I'd better go and see what
your future father-in-law is up to.

08:08.300 --> 08:10.980
Let's hope he's not inspecting
the roof!

08:15.820 --> 08:19.059
Ah! Good evening, Father.

08:19.060 --> 08:22.299
Er... Bobby will get you a drink.

08:22.300 --> 08:23.700
Thank you.

08:28.980 --> 08:30.500
Duke of Wellington?

08:32.220 --> 08:35.140
Oh. Close, but no cigar.

08:35.179 --> 08:39.539
This is Major General
Robert Craufurd, AKA Black Bob.

08:39.580 --> 08:42.900
My little brother, Arthur,
was the Duke of Wellington.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.980
Black Bob's my lucky charm.

08:50.540 --> 08:51.900
(Lord knows I need it.)

08:54.380 --> 08:56.059
RAUCOUS LAUGHTER

08:56.060 --> 08:58.020
More sauce with your tart, sir?

08:58.060 --> 09:00.820
No! Thank you.

09:02.100 --> 09:03.820
You must give us the grand tour.

09:03.860 --> 09:07.500
Joanie's interested
in your subterranean maze.

09:07.540 --> 09:11.620
Fascinating.
Built by the 5th Marquis, I believe.

09:11.660 --> 09:14.779
But why would he build a maze
underground?

09:14.780 --> 09:17.939
Because he was as mad as a sack
of ferrets and had a bet

09:17.940 --> 09:21.180
that he could build
the most fiendish maze.

09:21.220 --> 09:25.020
Modelled on a design by Frigimelica.

09:25.060 --> 09:28.420
Although I don't suppose that will
mean anything to any of you.

09:28.460 --> 09:31.540
Architect of the Villa Pisani
Labyrinth in Stra.

09:31.580 --> 09:34.020
Reputed to be the most difficult
maze in the world.

09:35.420 --> 09:37.700
You ARE well-informed.

09:37.740 --> 09:40.299
She spends too much time
with her nose in a book.

09:40.300 --> 09:42.820
She said she wanted to go to
university, I said,

09:42.860 --> 09:45.740
"That's no preparation for life."

09:45.780 --> 09:48.020
Depends on what sort of life.

09:49.860 --> 09:52.260
I like puzzles, and would like to
see it, if I may?

09:55.780 --> 09:58.979
Well, as long as you're accompanied.

09:58.980 --> 10:01.419
We've already lost one guest
in there,

10:01.420 --> 10:03.820
so we don't like to take
any chances.

10:03.860 --> 10:05.980
And when she says lost, she means...

10:09.620 --> 10:12.980
Don't stop when it's starting
to get interesting!

10:13.020 --> 10:16.220
A chap named Peregrine Goodluck.

10:16.260 --> 10:18.860
Unfortunately monikered,
as transpires.

10:18.900 --> 10:21.259
He wandered in during a house party.

10:21.260 --> 10:24.019
Everyone thought he'd left
early without saying his goodbyes.

10:24.020 --> 10:28.140
Six months later,
they found his skeleton.

10:28.180 --> 10:32.500
The servants think his ghost's
still in there... trying to get out.

10:35.580 --> 10:36.979
Poor soul.

10:36.980 --> 10:40.619
Well, on that subject,
we'll have coffee now.

10:40.620 --> 10:43.620
I'm sure that some of our guests
will need to go.

10:43.660 --> 10:45.659
I asked Bunty to stay the night.

10:45.660 --> 10:48.059
We can't have her driving half-cut.

10:48.060 --> 10:49.940
Especially after last time.

10:51.820 --> 10:53.780
BUNTY GIGGLES

11:04.180 --> 11:06.020
I'm sorry.

11:07.820 --> 11:09.060
I didn't mean no harm.

11:10.300 --> 11:11.860
Please don't tell Her Ladyship.

11:11.900 --> 11:15.340
I have no intention of telling
Lady Deadlock.

11:15.380 --> 11:17.340
She reminds me of my mother.

11:17.380 --> 11:19.220
Which is by no means a compliment.

11:22.100 --> 11:24.499
Thank you. I need this job.

11:24.500 --> 11:27.659
At least until I've saved
enough money to get back to London,

11:27.660 --> 11:29.060
and my old life.

11:29.100 --> 11:31.180
I'm guessing you weren't
a housemaid.

11:31.220 --> 11:33.180
A dancer. Hm!

11:33.220 --> 11:35.660
At the Windmill Club in Soho.

11:35.700 --> 11:38.019
You won't have heard of it.
I know it well.

11:38.020 --> 11:39.500
You're surprised?

11:39.540 --> 11:43.060
It's not the sort of place
respectable ladies are seen.

11:43.100 --> 11:47.099
That's because I'm neither a lady
nor respectable.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.260
At least, according to my parents.

11:50.500 --> 11:52.700
My parents said much the same thing,
miss. Hm!

11:55.860 --> 11:57.540
I'm sorry about your baby.

11:58.700 --> 12:00.420
Don't be.

12:00.460 --> 12:02.499
I've plans.

12:02.500 --> 12:06.140
The last thing I need
is to be saddled with a kid. Hm.

12:06.180 --> 12:09.299
If that's everything... Oh, Ruby?

12:09.300 --> 12:12.420
Take the stole.
It'll be just the thing for London.

12:14.260 --> 12:15.500
What's wrong?

12:17.420 --> 12:21.340
In my experience, folk don't give
things away for nothing, is all.

12:21.380 --> 12:23.380
BUNTY SIGHS

13:00.740 --> 13:02.340
Ruby?!

13:06.660 --> 13:08.100
Ruby?

13:24.300 --> 13:25.779
Any witnesses? No, sir.

13:25.780 --> 13:28.539
She and the butler are the only
live-in servants.

13:28.540 --> 13:31.059
Also here last night were

13:31.060 --> 13:34.180
the Marquis and Dowager Marchioness
and three house guests,

13:34.220 --> 13:36.739
Mr and Miss Vanderlande and
the Honourable Penelope Windermere,

13:36.740 --> 13:38.260
who found the body.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.380
Is something bothering you, Padre?

13:44.860 --> 13:49.060
Well, she must have fallen
from, what... 30 feet?

13:50.860 --> 13:52.740
I'd have expected there to be
more blood.

13:52.780 --> 13:55.939
If you're sniffing around for
a mystery, you won't find one here.

13:55.940 --> 13:58.059
We've got ourselves a jumper.

13:58.060 --> 14:00.300
She was straight out of
a mother-and-baby home.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.539
It wouldn't be the first time,
and I doubt it will be the last.

14:03.540 --> 14:05.260
Get a statement from Miss Windermere

14:05.300 --> 14:07.180
and make sure you search
the battlements.

14:07.220 --> 14:08.780
Miss Jewel might have left a note.

14:08.820 --> 14:10.180
Righty-ho, sir.

14:13.780 --> 14:15.180
That policeman is wrong.

14:16.740 --> 14:19.980
Go on.
She wasn't sad about her baby.

14:20.020 --> 14:22.220
Quite the contrary, in fact.

14:22.260 --> 14:25.300
Unless she's a very good liar.

14:30.220 --> 14:31.780
KNOCK AT DOOR
Come!

14:37.660 --> 14:39.100
I take it this is about Ruby.

14:42.340 --> 14:43.780
Mm.

14:45.780 --> 14:49.460
I wondered what state of mind
she was in. I see.

14:49.500 --> 14:52.660
She was a decent worker, if subdued.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.220
Obviously grieving for her baby.

14:56.260 --> 14:57.979
Oh. I see.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.780
It's such a shame she couldn't
put her past behind her.

15:02.060 --> 15:03.580
There's no such thing.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.100
Something she said yesterday.

15:08.660 --> 15:11.580
BELL RINGS
If you'll excuse me, Father?

15:14.660 --> 15:16.620
Can you see yourself out?
Yes, of course.

16:09.060 --> 16:11.460
WHISTLING
Who's there?!

16:17.740 --> 16:19.579
What's done is done. Logan says...

16:19.580 --> 16:21.419
And you always do as Logan says!

16:21.420 --> 16:23.499
He seems to have more authority
than me!

16:23.500 --> 16:25.500
Well, do you have another plan?!

16:25.540 --> 16:27.699
We both know the alternative!

16:27.700 --> 16:29.740
If you're looking for Her Ladyship,

16:29.780 --> 16:31.740
she's out in the garden,
having a walk.

16:33.460 --> 16:36.099
Actually, I wanted to talk to you.

16:36.100 --> 16:37.260
About Ruby Jewel.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.259
The suicide.

16:39.260 --> 16:42.139
Well, cause of death
hasn't been established yet.

16:42.140 --> 16:44.780
Either way, I wouldn't know her
from Adam.

16:44.820 --> 16:48.860
Although it is strange
that you knew her original name,

16:48.900 --> 16:51.180
whereas here she was only known
as Smith.

16:54.580 --> 16:57.059
And if we were... acquainted?

16:57.060 --> 17:01.460
I'm a widower, and paying a young
lady for her time isn't illegal.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.460
Nor something you'd want
bandied about

17:03.500 --> 17:05.700
on the occasion of your daughter's
engagement.

17:05.740 --> 17:07.980
Oh-ho! I get it!

17:09.619 --> 17:12.859
You think she was blackmailing me.
Was she?

17:12.900 --> 17:15.460
No, but I wouldn't put it past her
if she was.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.898
She wasn't the kind of girl
that could keep a secret.

17:17.900 --> 17:20.380
Nor the sort who would take
her own life.

17:20.420 --> 17:23.020
I didn't push her, if that's
what you're getting at.

17:23.060 --> 17:26.420
Let me tell you something, one of
the advantages of extreme wealth

17:26.460 --> 17:31.780
is the ability to buy people's
silence without resorting to murder.

17:33.380 --> 17:34.780
On the subject of which...

17:36.220 --> 17:37.620
..how much do you want?

17:39.100 --> 17:41.020
Call it a... donation.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.700
Thank you, Mr Vanderlande...

17:44.980 --> 17:47.180
..but my silence is complimentary.

17:47.220 --> 17:49.020
Help!

17:56.660 --> 17:59.179
You were warned not to go in there
alone!

17:59.180 --> 18:01.900
The silly girl!
She must have got lost!

18:01.940 --> 18:03.420
I wasn't lost.

18:03.460 --> 18:05.660
I followed a mathematical algorithm
to the centre.

18:05.700 --> 18:08.900
There's a column depicting
the Minotaur legend. Spot-on.

18:08.940 --> 18:12.340
As I was making my way back,
I heard whistling.

18:12.380 --> 18:13.980
WHISTLED TUNE

18:17.060 --> 18:19.260
SHE HYPERVENTILATES

18:19.300 --> 18:22.100
Someone's been listening to
too many ghost stories.

18:22.140 --> 18:23.939
I don't believe in ghosts.

18:23.940 --> 18:26.459
Did you see this... someone?

18:26.460 --> 18:27.980
Only a hand.

18:28.020 --> 18:30.660
Well, maybe we should take a look.
Certainly not.

18:31.900 --> 18:35.500
I will inform the police
and they can conduct

18:35.540 --> 18:38.939
a wild ghost chase
if they're so inclined.

18:38.940 --> 18:41.180
I have served tea on the lawn.

18:43.060 --> 18:44.860
Thank you, Logan.

18:44.900 --> 18:49.740
I am sure Miss Vanderlande
would benefit from some refreshment.

19:08.060 --> 19:11.099
What is an algo-thing,
when it's at home?

19:11.100 --> 19:12.900
Er... mathematics.

19:12.940 --> 19:16.740
Mazes without loops are known
as simply connected, or perfect,

19:16.780 --> 19:19.700
and are equivalent to a tree
in graph theory.

19:19.740 --> 19:21.059
I'm boring you.

19:21.060 --> 19:23.620
No, on the contrary, I'm curious.

19:23.660 --> 19:25.060
You must show me sometime.

19:28.140 --> 19:29.540
Sir!

19:33.380 --> 19:36.100
We found it on the roof,
shoved inside a rain barrel.

19:38.940 --> 19:41.060
Penelope Windermere.

19:43.020 --> 19:44.380
Bring her in.

19:48.500 --> 19:51.499
We found this on the roof,
shoved in a rain barrel.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.500
Do you recognise it? Is that blood?

19:53.540 --> 19:55.540
I'll ask the questions,
if you don't mind.

19:56.660 --> 19:59.020
It was mine, but I gave it to Ruby.

19:59.060 --> 20:01.220
How much would an item like this
cost?

20:01.260 --> 20:03.820
It's frightfully vulgar
to talk about money.

20:03.860 --> 20:05.300
Humour me.

20:06.460 --> 20:07.940
Around 60 guineas.

20:09.180 --> 20:11.980
It's quite an expensive gift
to give to a maid.

20:12.020 --> 20:13.460
Green is so last season.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.300
According to witness statements,

20:18.340 --> 20:21.140
you were the last person
she spoke to yesterday night,

20:21.180 --> 20:25.820
and, coincidentally, the person
who found her body this morning.

20:25.860 --> 20:29.220
And you maintain that you were
in your room the entire night.

20:30.820 --> 20:31.980
Yes.

20:33.380 --> 20:35.180
I hope you don't think I pushed her?

20:35.220 --> 20:36.460
No, Miss Windermere,

20:36.500 --> 20:39.820
because she was already dead
when she fell from the roof.

20:41.380 --> 20:43.899
Bludgeoned over the head
by a right-handed assailant

20:43.900 --> 20:46.380
approximately six inches taller.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.540
The victim was five foot six.

20:49.580 --> 20:51.060
Can I ask how tall you are?

20:52.180 --> 20:53.620
Five feet ten.

20:55.180 --> 20:57.700
And no doubt taller in heels.

20:57.740 --> 20:59.939
Are you arresting me?!

20:59.940 --> 21:03.140
Unfortunately, due to the lack of
evidence, that's not possible.

21:03.180 --> 21:05.700
So I'm going to get this blood
tested, and if it matches

21:05.740 --> 21:08.460
that of the victim,
then I'm going to arrest you.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.900
Perhaps you should search
the labyrinth.

21:10.940 --> 21:12.540
I beg your pardon?

21:12.580 --> 21:14.739
Joan Vanderlande thought
she saw someone in there.

21:14.740 --> 21:16.580
Didn't Lady Malmort tell you?

21:16.620 --> 21:18.220
KNOCK AT DOOR

21:18.260 --> 21:20.660
Lady Felicia's here, sir,
with Father Brown.

21:20.700 --> 21:23.300
And the Chief Constable
wants you to call him.

21:27.980 --> 21:30.420
And this is the nursery.

21:30.460 --> 21:32.540
Rather dusty, due to lack of use.

21:34.860 --> 21:37.940
Bobby and Arthur.

21:37.980 --> 21:39.340
My brother.

21:41.220 --> 21:42.620
Is he...?

21:44.460 --> 21:46.060
How old was he when he died?

21:47.300 --> 21:49.300
He... He was four.

21:49.340 --> 21:50.660
I'm sorry.

21:52.180 --> 21:53.779
So am I.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.740
And this is Copenhagen.

21:56.860 --> 21:59.300
Favourite steed
of the Duke of Wellington.

21:59.340 --> 22:01.620
Gosh, you really ARE
a bluestocking.

22:01.660 --> 22:03.500
Hm. Don't tell my father.

22:03.540 --> 22:06.659
He finds education in a woman
highly unbecoming.

22:06.660 --> 22:08.900
My mother merely bemoans
the lack of mine.

22:08.940 --> 22:11.420
I think my father and your mother
have far more in common

22:11.460 --> 22:13.339
than either of them
would like to think.

22:13.340 --> 22:16.100
At least we know the score.

22:16.140 --> 22:19.540
Apropos, there's something
I'd like to say.

22:27.340 --> 22:30.979
An heir and a spare
and you can do your own thing.

22:30.980 --> 22:32.580
If you get my drift?

22:32.620 --> 22:34.180
Thank you.

22:36.460 --> 22:39.740
Right, well, um... shall we see
the rest of the house?

22:43.900 --> 22:46.540
I think you're supposed
to put it on, or something.

22:46.580 --> 22:49.579
I can tell by looking
it doesn't fit.

22:49.580 --> 22:54.500
Right. Well... you... you can take it
to a jeweller, I expect.

22:58.180 --> 23:00.659
Murdered?! Oh, the poor child!

23:00.660 --> 23:03.340
She never struck one
as the suicidal type.

23:03.380 --> 23:06.180
Yet Mr Logan was keen to give
the opposite impression.

23:08.340 --> 23:10.740
So, a blow to the head?

23:10.780 --> 23:13.580
By a right-handed assailant
approximately six inches taller.

23:13.620 --> 23:15.259
Or higher.

23:15.260 --> 23:17.740
If she was killed on stairs.

23:18.820 --> 23:20.460
Excellent point, milady.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.740
Well, that means it could have been
anyone.

23:22.780 --> 23:24.699
Well, who would want to murder Ruby?

23:24.700 --> 23:26.699
Perhaps she wasn't
the intended victim.

23:26.700 --> 23:31.660
If she was wearing my stole, then
maybe the killer mistook her for me.

23:31.700 --> 23:34.139
Oh, and who on earth would want
to murder you?

23:34.140 --> 23:36.220
Why did you give Ruby your stole?

23:38.100 --> 23:39.540
The real answer.

23:41.060 --> 23:42.339
Oh, all right.

23:42.340 --> 23:46.500
I asked her deliver a message
to Bobby, asking him to meet me.

23:46.540 --> 23:48.740
Your niece is absolutely shameless!

23:48.780 --> 23:51.179
Which is why I didn't tell that
to Inspector Mallory.

23:51.180 --> 23:53.420
People were bound to get
the wrong end of the stick.

23:53.460 --> 23:55.020
And the right end of the stick?

23:55.060 --> 23:57.500
Bobby's an old friend, and his
absolute witch of a mother

23:57.540 --> 24:00.540
made sure that we didn't have
one minute alone all night.

24:00.580 --> 24:03.219
So I suggested a chinwag
at the summerhouse.

24:03.220 --> 24:05.019
But, of course, he didn't show.

24:05.020 --> 24:09.100
Congratulations, Bunty, I'm away
one day and you get arrested
for murder! Oh!

24:10.700 --> 24:13.300
I wonder if the police
have searched the labyrinth?

24:13.340 --> 24:15.580
Well, that's exactly what I asked
Inspector Mallory,

24:15.620 --> 24:17.780
but he had no clue
what I was talking about.

24:23.900 --> 24:25.659
Oh. Hello.

24:25.660 --> 24:28.540
You're back. Only to get my things.

24:28.580 --> 24:32.180
I hear a congratulations
are in order. Thank you.

24:32.220 --> 24:36.260
Oh, gosh, that is a knuckleduster!

24:36.300 --> 24:37.500
Why aren't you wearing it?

24:37.540 --> 24:40.660
It doesn't fit. I think that much
is obvious to everyone.

24:40.700 --> 24:44.180
Well, it can be altered.

24:45.860 --> 24:46.900
Or...

24:48.900 --> 24:52.700
..until then, you could tie a thread
around it. May I?

24:54.380 --> 24:58.980
You know, if you dig away,
Bobby really is quite a good egg.

24:59.020 --> 25:00.940
Not to mention devilishly handsome.

25:03.900 --> 25:07.140
What I'm trying to say is,
you could do worse.

25:08.220 --> 25:11.500
All considered,
he is very lucky to have you.

25:13.780 --> 25:16.260
That should do,
until you can get it altered.

25:31.500 --> 25:33.140
Going somewhere?

25:33.180 --> 25:35.580
London. Flying visit.

25:35.620 --> 25:37.100
But you've only just got back.

25:37.140 --> 25:39.099
I know, but something came up.

25:39.100 --> 25:40.860
Something, or someone?

25:40.900 --> 25:43.860
I know what you're thinking, but you
couldn't be further from the truth.

25:43.900 --> 25:45.940
Well, then, why all this secrecy?

25:45.980 --> 25:47.980
Believe me, if I could tell you,
I would.

25:48.020 --> 25:50.019
Oh, yes, of course you would(!)

25:50.020 --> 25:54.139
If I wasn't a nosy old gossip
with ideas above her station.

25:54.140 --> 25:56.900
Well, I'll wish Your Ladyship
a pleasant journey.

25:56.940 --> 25:58.540
Mrs McCarthy!

25:58.580 --> 26:00.340
TRAIN WHISTLE

26:18.860 --> 26:20.660
Father?

26:22.620 --> 26:24.700
Ariadne's thread. Whose?

26:24.740 --> 26:25.780
How apt.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.220
Lover of Theseus.

26:30.260 --> 26:32.860
She gave him a ball of red twine

26:32.900 --> 26:36.380
so that he could find his way out of
the Minotaur's Labyrinth.

26:38.700 --> 26:40.380
Stay here.

26:54.820 --> 26:58.060
Oh, Lord, please, not now.

27:01.540 --> 27:03.140
Need a light?

27:03.180 --> 27:04.780
Yes.

27:04.820 --> 27:07.580
I thought I told you to stay put.

27:07.620 --> 27:10.419
Didn't my aunt tell you?
I never do as I'm told.

27:10.420 --> 27:12.619
He's no oil painting.

27:12.620 --> 27:14.740
The offspring of a Cretan queen

27:14.780 --> 27:17.540
and a magnificent bull.

27:17.580 --> 27:20.220
King Minos built a labyrinth
to contain him.

27:26.900 --> 27:30.579
That's Bobby's lucky mascot.
He never goes anywhere without it.

27:30.580 --> 27:32.260
Close, but no cigar.

27:34.940 --> 27:38.220
More to the point... what's it
doing here?

27:47.220 --> 27:49.340
Where does it go? Up.

28:14.260 --> 28:15.260
Is that a blood stain?

28:16.500 --> 28:17.900
I fear so.

28:19.340 --> 28:23.260
So... do we run, or overpower him?

28:23.300 --> 28:24.860
Neither.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.140
My name is Father Brown.

28:38.020 --> 28:40.300
And you, I assume, are Arthur.

28:43.300 --> 28:45.820
I believe I have something of yours.

28:50.740 --> 28:52.820
Field Marshal Arthur Wellesley.

28:52.860 --> 28:54.060
Who's he?

28:57.060 --> 28:58.500
The 1st Duke of Wellington.

28:58.540 --> 29:00.340
No, I mean, who is HE?

29:04.180 --> 29:05.780
He's my brother.

29:09.540 --> 29:12.739
Lab results, sir. The blood type
matches that of the victim.

29:12.740 --> 29:14.420
There's something else.

29:16.020 --> 29:19.220
"Meet me in the summerhouse,
one o'clock. Bunty."

29:19.260 --> 29:22.700
I think the time has come to arrest
Miss Windermere.

29:26.540 --> 29:28.379
He was the loveliest child.

29:28.380 --> 29:29.980
Sunny and good-natured.

29:31.740 --> 29:36.300
It wasn't until he was three
that we noticed he was... different.

29:37.420 --> 29:40.819
That while his body grew,
his brain had somehow stalled.

29:40.820 --> 29:42.980
He was a mental defective,
we were told,

29:43.020 --> 29:46.580
and the only option was
a discreet institution.

29:46.620 --> 29:48.260
I visited several of them,

29:48.300 --> 29:50.700
but I found that the children there
were...

29:50.740 --> 29:54.940
They were not like Arthur,
who was sweet and loving.

29:56.860 --> 30:01.860
They appeared to be... joyless
and empty.

30:01.900 --> 30:06.540
So... you declared him dead.

30:06.580 --> 30:09.060
We had Bobby to think about.

30:09.100 --> 30:12.539
Any stain of mental illness
would have ruined his prospects.

30:12.540 --> 30:14.980
As it transpires,
I managed that all by myself.

30:15.020 --> 30:20.980
We engaged Logan in his capacity
as a mental-deficiency nurse.

30:21.020 --> 30:24.580
And the labyrinth
for his exercise yard.

30:24.620 --> 30:28.060
Arthur loves it! He knows it like
the back of his hand!

30:28.100 --> 30:29.500
The servants don't go near it,

30:29.540 --> 30:32.419
so he can wander there
to his heart's content!

30:32.420 --> 30:35.619
You rejected one institution
only to replace it with another.

30:35.620 --> 30:37.740
I wouldn't expect YOU to understand.

30:39.260 --> 30:42.500
The difference is,
here, he is loved.

30:42.540 --> 30:45.939
Yes.
Surrounded by his favourite things,

30:45.940 --> 30:50.020
and the people who keep him safe.

30:50.060 --> 30:52.420
Ruby wasn't safe.
It was an accident!

30:52.460 --> 30:54.300
Arthur cries if he hurts a fly.

30:54.340 --> 30:56.299
I think...

30:56.300 --> 30:58.620
Logan should explain.

31:02.700 --> 31:06.300
Arthur gets overexcited
when Bobby's at home.

31:06.340 --> 31:10.740
He couldn't sleep, so I left his
room to fetch a sleeping draught

31:10.780 --> 31:13.540
and returned to find
the door unlocked.

31:14.620 --> 31:16.659
I can only assume she burst in

31:16.660 --> 31:19.780
and scared him and he lashed out.

31:19.820 --> 31:21.459
And then?

31:21.460 --> 31:23.340
I'm ashamed to say, I panicked.

31:23.380 --> 31:26.460
Threw the body off the roof
to make it look like suicide.

31:29.580 --> 31:31.260
You knew of this?

31:31.300 --> 31:32.460
Only after the event.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.220
But I don't blame Logan.

31:37.940 --> 31:39.380
He did it out of loyalty.

31:39.420 --> 31:41.700
The scandal would be ruinous.

31:41.740 --> 31:45.099
They'd lock Arthur up
with the criminally insane.

31:45.100 --> 31:47.100
We no longer have a choice.

31:47.140 --> 31:48.739
Ahem!

31:48.740 --> 31:50.900
That's it, it's over.

31:52.140 --> 31:57.220
Now, if you will excuse me, I would
like to telephone the police myself.

32:17.420 --> 32:19.780
I'd rather they hanged him.

32:19.820 --> 32:21.420
At least it would be quick.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.300
Um... may I?

32:35.180 --> 32:36.660
Excuse me.

32:40.980 --> 32:42.740
Ah!

32:42.780 --> 32:44.780
It puts pay to my arranged marriage.

32:46.620 --> 32:48.700
Just as I was starting to like
the girl.

32:57.180 --> 32:58.300
Hello again, Arthur.

33:00.660 --> 33:02.020
Now, I was wondering...

33:06.140 --> 33:07.860
..if you like sherbet lemons?

33:18.940 --> 33:20.939
Ah, yes.

33:20.940 --> 33:22.140
Tea-time!

33:27.100 --> 33:28.940
You shouldn't be here.

33:28.980 --> 33:31.700
I wanted to ask Arthur
what had happened.

33:31.740 --> 33:34.179
You can't ask him questions.

33:34.180 --> 33:36.180
He's got the mental age
of an infant.

33:36.220 --> 33:39.220
Then he doesn't have
the wherewithal to lie.

33:39.260 --> 33:40.540
Did a girl come in here?

33:44.740 --> 33:45.940
Were you frightened?

33:48.740 --> 33:50.180
Did you hit her?

33:51.420 --> 33:54.219
You can't give credence
to anything he says.

33:54.220 --> 33:56.659
When I chanced into this room,

33:56.660 --> 33:58.780
Arthur hid himself
behind the curtains.

34:00.100 --> 34:02.580
When Ruby did the same, we're
expected to believe that Arthur

34:02.620 --> 34:05.420
took a poker and brutally
clubbed her to death.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.660
Steady on, mate,
I'm not going to hurt you.

34:07.700 --> 34:11.139
And I think she discovered
Arthur's existence

34:11.139 --> 34:13.340
and threatened to tell.

34:15.820 --> 34:18.460
You... should not be up here.

34:18.500 --> 34:19.938
What's the story with him?

34:19.940 --> 34:21.260
None of your business.

34:21.300 --> 34:24.139
You know, I thought this place was
weird, but a lunatic in the attic?

34:24.139 --> 34:25.739
Go!

34:25.780 --> 34:27.699
All right, I'm going.

34:32.460 --> 34:33.699
Oh!

34:36.340 --> 34:39.300
That's hardly a motive for murder.

34:39.340 --> 34:42.699
No. But money is.

34:42.699 --> 34:47.060
Lady Malmort pays you handsomely
for your... discretion.

34:47.100 --> 34:49.179
So handsomely that you can afford

34:49.219 --> 34:51.739
to retain the services
of a stockbroker.

34:52.980 --> 34:56.340
If Arthur's existence was revealed,
all that would end.

34:56.380 --> 34:58.659
You think anyone would question
my account

34:58.660 --> 35:01.220
over that of a mental defective?

35:03.580 --> 35:04.740
No.

35:06.620 --> 35:09.780
Which is why you need to tell
the truth, and save your soul.

35:10.740 --> 35:15.660
Lest this poor innocent
is condemned to a living hell.

35:15.700 --> 35:20.180
Lend credence to this fairy tale
when there's no proof?

35:22.660 --> 35:25.699
Well, the proof is right before us.

35:25.700 --> 35:27.260
Would you care for another one?

35:31.580 --> 35:33.739
Arthur's left-handed.

35:33.740 --> 35:37.020
Ruby was killed by a right-handed
blow to the skull.

35:37.060 --> 35:39.260
A fact of which the police
are well aware.

35:55.140 --> 35:58.580
Bunty! Logan, he's our man!
Stop him!

36:16.300 --> 36:18.460
Let's see if we can find
Miss Windermere.

36:20.020 --> 36:22.540
I don't think that'll be necessary,
sir.

36:22.580 --> 36:25.780
Miss Windermere,
I'd like you to stop!

36:25.820 --> 36:27.780
Stop, Miss...!

36:32.100 --> 36:34.339
Are you all right, sir?
Take a wild guess!

36:34.340 --> 36:35.780
Shall I get some help, sir?

36:35.820 --> 36:37.820
No, I want you to get after her!

36:55.180 --> 36:56.660
Can't you go any faster?

36:56.700 --> 36:58.300
Hang on to your hat, sir.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.260
BRAKES SCREECH

37:23.300 --> 37:24.500
This is all we need!

37:27.780 --> 37:30.460
Go around him! Beat him!
HORN BLASTS

37:32.180 --> 37:34.820
Get out of the way!
Cut across the grass.

37:37.540 --> 37:38.940
Idiot!

37:42.380 --> 37:45.820
Oh, come on! The jig is up,
you might as well hand yourself in!

37:48.500 --> 37:51.900
Ah! Excellent timing, Inspector.
This is your murderer.

37:54.420 --> 37:57.620
You do the honours
while I arrest Miss Windermere.

37:57.660 --> 38:01.020
What have I done?! Let's start with
obstructing an officer

38:01.060 --> 38:03.380
in the execution of his duty...
Right, sir, out you get.

38:03.420 --> 38:05.940
..exceeding the statutory
speed limit on a public road,

38:05.980 --> 38:10.980
dangerous driving, not to mention
your culpable and reckless conduct.

38:13.300 --> 38:14.860
Out you get, come on.

38:22.620 --> 38:24.779
The police said you were free
to leave.

38:24.780 --> 38:27.660
I imagine you would want to do that
immediately.

38:27.700 --> 38:30.620
Sounds like you've a right scandal
on your hands.

38:30.660 --> 38:35.700
I realise this renders
any engagement null and void.

38:38.260 --> 38:40.060
800 years of history.

38:41.220 --> 38:43.460
There's bound to be the odd skeleton
in the closet.

38:44.700 --> 38:46.179
Of course, he'll have to go.

38:46.180 --> 38:49.540
There are plenty of places
for the likes of him,

38:49.580 --> 38:53.860
but apart from that, I see no reason
why the marriage can't go ahead.

38:53.900 --> 38:56.300
Isn't that rather up to
your daughter?

38:56.340 --> 38:58.340
She'll do as she's told.

39:00.180 --> 39:04.220
I believe... you may be
underestimating her, sir.

39:06.420 --> 39:09.700
Come on! What are you thinking?!

39:12.420 --> 39:14.380
That I would like to meet him.

39:19.300 --> 39:21.700
I've brought someone to see you.

39:21.740 --> 39:23.820
Er... this is Joan.

39:23.860 --> 39:25.539
She... She's a friend.

39:25.540 --> 39:27.660
Like Logan?

39:29.020 --> 39:30.380
Yes.

39:35.460 --> 39:39.300
Do you like horses?

39:40.460 --> 39:44.340
Well, I'm scared of real ones,
but I like toy horses.

39:46.340 --> 39:48.380
And I think his name is Copenhagen.

39:49.740 --> 39:51.979
And this grey one is called Marengo.

39:51.980 --> 39:54.700
She's a bit of a clever clogs.

39:56.860 --> 39:59.860
Oh, th... those are spectacles.

39:59.900 --> 40:02.300
He's never seen anyone
that wears them.

40:02.340 --> 40:04.780
His life is confined in here?

40:05.820 --> 40:07.100
He's happy.

40:09.580 --> 40:11.140
Would you like to look?

40:16.180 --> 40:19.700
My eyes don't work,
and these help me see.

40:19.740 --> 40:22.940
Although if you wear them, I imagine
things will look very blurry.

40:25.740 --> 40:28.020
ARTHUR CHUCKLES

40:30.260 --> 40:31.980
Can Joan stay?

40:32.020 --> 40:33.260
Um...

40:36.220 --> 40:37.700
I-I hope so.

40:41.580 --> 40:42.940
Arthur will stay, too.

40:45.620 --> 40:47.420
Would you like to live with me
and Bobby?

40:48.660 --> 40:49.860
Downstairs?

40:51.540 --> 40:53.060
Yes, downstairs.

40:54.740 --> 40:56.540
I think we'd all get on famously.

41:07.580 --> 41:11.459
The good news is your father has
managed to get the charges dropped

41:11.460 --> 41:13.859
on the grounds you were aiding
a police officer.

41:13.860 --> 41:15.540
The bad news is, er...

41:16.700 --> 41:18.859
Well, it's you, I'm afraid.

41:18.860 --> 41:21.500
Well, this isn't what happened
at all!

41:21.540 --> 41:22.740
Is Daddy livid?

41:22.780 --> 41:25.139
It was the final straw, I'm afraid.

41:25.140 --> 41:26.820
Your allowance has been cut off.

41:26.860 --> 41:29.660
And it's been decided you should
stay here for a few months,

41:29.700 --> 41:32.459
where there's less opportunity
of you finding trouble.

41:32.460 --> 41:35.740
What, in Kembleford?!
I think I'd rather be in prison.

41:35.780 --> 41:39.220
This is serious!
It's the last straw, Bunty.

41:39.260 --> 41:43.580
One more false move
and you'll be disinherited.

41:43.620 --> 41:48.100
Besides, I need someone to look
after things while I'm gone.

41:49.500 --> 41:51.780
Gone? Where are you going?

41:56.540 --> 42:00.340
Monty has been appointed
Northern Governor in Rhodesia.

42:00.380 --> 42:03.060
It was all terribly hush-hush
and protocol,

42:03.100 --> 42:06.099
which is why I couldn't say
anything. Rhodesia?

42:06.100 --> 42:10.299
I need someone to look after Bunty
while I'm away.

42:10.300 --> 42:12.100
Keep her out of trouble.

42:12.140 --> 42:14.740
Rhodesia in... Africa?

42:17.100 --> 42:19.420
What a marvellous opportunity.

42:19.460 --> 42:21.499
Isn't it thrilling?

42:21.500 --> 42:23.700
Finally, a chance to escape
the mundane.

42:23.740 --> 42:28.980
Yes. Well, I suppose it's not like
there's anything to keep you here.

42:29.020 --> 42:31.620
You will be sorely missed.

42:31.660 --> 42:33.460
KETTLE WHISTLES

42:41.740 --> 42:44.060
FLIRTATIOUS CHATTER

43:01.740 --> 43:03.819
That girl's going to be trouble.

43:03.820 --> 43:05.420
I'm not worried.

43:06.580 --> 43:09.579
Because she's in the hands of
someone who's wise and compassionate

43:09.580 --> 43:12.660
and... of the highest
moral integrity.

43:14.700 --> 43:18.740
A dear friend,
who I would trust with my life.

43:18.780 --> 43:23.380
And who I will miss more
than... they will ever know.

43:28.580 --> 43:31.540
Well, I'm sure the Father
would be very glad to hear that.

43:31.580 --> 43:33.580
I'm not talking about Father Brown.

43:39.940 --> 43:42.180
And I'm going to miss you, too.

43:44.380 --> 43:46.780
Goodbye, Father.
