00:03.370 --> 00:05.520
- (Nora):
Josh, not the silver!

00:05.600 --> 00:08.729
- How long do we have?
- Maybe 30 minutes.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.529
- I'm on a runaway train.

00:10.610 --> 00:11.668
- You're back!

00:11.740 --> 00:13.276
- I can't see Josh...

00:13.340 --> 00:15.138
- Yes, you can.
- ...real Josh...

00:15.210 --> 00:16.347
Till the next full moon?

00:16.410 --> 00:17.673
He's a full-time wolf now?

00:17.750 --> 00:18.740
- He's gone.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.539
- Aaah!
- Stop!

00:20.620 --> 00:22.816
I don't know what that was.

00:22.890 --> 00:25.746
- Sally! Sally!
- Sally?

00:25.820 --> 00:28.187
- Guys? Guys!

00:28.260 --> 00:31.480
- I love you, Aidan, but I'm not
gonna cease to exist

00:31.560 --> 00:33.426
if you are not ready
to say it back.

00:33.500 --> 00:37.289
- Now, you be good to your
mother while I am gone, Isaac.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.589
I want to be with you forever.

00:45.510 --> 00:47.638
- Aidan.

00:47.710 --> 00:49.849
(* Sleeping at Last singing
In The Embers *)

00:49.910 --> 00:51.446
** We live and we die *

00:51.510 --> 00:54.343
It's me.

00:54.420 --> 00:56.582
- Suzanna?

00:56.650 --> 00:59.256
* Like fireworks... *

00:59.320 --> 01:00.458
(Stammering)

01:00.520 --> 01:02.181
- Come inside. Come on.

01:02.260 --> 01:04.183
(Sizzling)

01:04.260 --> 01:06.228
(Gasps)

01:06.300 --> 01:10.328
* May our stories catch fire *

01:10.400 --> 01:12.232
- I'm sorry.

01:13.470 --> 01:15.598
I'm sorry.

01:15.670 --> 01:21.530
* And burn bright enough
to catch God's eye *

01:21.610 --> 01:27.743
* Like fireworks
we pull apart the dark *

01:27.820 --> 01:32.212
* Compete against the stars *

01:32.290 --> 01:33.553
- Josh?

01:33.620 --> 01:35.816
* With all of our hearts *

01:35.890 --> 01:38.552
* Till our temporary
brilliance *

01:38.630 --> 01:40.621
I'm here now.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.566
* Turns to ash *

01:42.630 --> 01:44.621
It's Sally.

01:44.700 --> 01:47.431
* We pull apart the darkness
while we can *

01:47.500 --> 01:51.368
I want you to know
that I came back different.

01:51.440 --> 01:54.501
Powerful.

01:54.580 --> 02:00.371
Well, I mean, "powerful" might
be overstating things a little.

02:00.450 --> 02:03.841
I sort of have this
introductory pyro deal

02:03.920 --> 02:05.945
and this unsettling ability

02:06.020 --> 02:09.558
to witness child murder in
other dimensions, apparently.

02:09.630 --> 02:13.419
So, yeah, I just gotta work on
the control factor a little bit.

02:13.500 --> 02:16.595
That's what I'm thinking.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.559
(Creaking)

02:18.630 --> 02:21.338
(Werewolf growling)

02:24.610 --> 02:26.476
Josh.

02:26.540 --> 02:28.975
(Werewolf growling)

02:29.040 --> 02:31.600
Josh, can you hear me?

02:31.680 --> 02:34.274
(Gasps)

02:34.350 --> 02:36.944
- Sally? What are you doing?

02:37.020 --> 02:38.886
Josh? Josh!

02:38.950 --> 02:42.227
It's all right!
I'm here.

02:42.290 --> 02:43.951
That's it.

02:44.030 --> 02:47.728
What happened?
What were you doing?

02:49.030 --> 02:53.365
(Birds chirping)

02:53.440 --> 02:55.590
Can you please just try
to stay out of there?

02:55.670 --> 02:57.559
It's the silver.

02:57.640 --> 03:01.304
The more he struggles,
the more he hurts himself.

03:03.510 --> 03:08.448
Look, I know you just got back,
and that you're hopeful.

03:08.520 --> 03:11.387
You wanna make a connection
to whatever part of Josh

03:11.450 --> 03:13.316
is still inside of that thing.

03:13.390 --> 03:16.451
But we've been out in these
woods, Sally, for 3 months.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.397
- Nora...
- I lost my best friend.

03:20.660 --> 03:22.628
I lost the one person
on this planet

03:22.700 --> 03:25.499
who actually understands me.

03:25.570 --> 03:28.540
I lost Josh.

03:28.600 --> 03:32.730
And every full moon, he comes
back a little bit worse.

03:32.810 --> 03:35.336
I can see it in his eyes!

03:37.010 --> 03:39.877
He's losing his humanity.

03:39.950 --> 03:41.748
So you're gonna
have to forgive me

03:41.820 --> 03:44.517
if my hope is on
short supply these days.

03:45.820 --> 03:47.788
- I think I can help him.

03:47.860 --> 03:50.420
(Sighing)

03:50.490 --> 03:51.787
- What did you say?

03:54.500 --> 03:56.491
- I have this...

03:56.570 --> 03:57.822
- Power.

03:57.900 --> 04:01.029
Yeah, I know you do.

04:01.100 --> 04:02.909
I've seen it.

04:02.970 --> 04:06.508
But what happened to you
after the fireworks show?

04:06.580 --> 04:08.378
Where the hell
did you go?

04:08.440 --> 04:11.375
- Well, I made it
back, didn't I?

04:11.450 --> 04:15.944
- I'm sorry. Maybe I've just
dug up one too many bodies.

04:16.019 --> 04:21.810
I know that it's probably
magic that got him into this,

04:21.890 --> 04:27.522
but Donna's magic, which is
your magic, too, now, I guess,

04:27.600 --> 04:29.989
scares the crap out of me.

04:32.670 --> 04:35.731
- All right.
I mean, so what?

04:35.800 --> 04:37.529
What's the plan?

04:37.610 --> 04:39.533
You and Aidan,
you stay out here,

04:39.610 --> 04:41.806
you stick to the s'mores
and hot dog diet

04:41.880 --> 04:43.700
and just wait it out,

04:43.780 --> 04:47.546
until the wolf takes over and
you lose your husband for good?

04:49.820 --> 04:51.686
You're right, Nora.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.809
Donna's magic is
what got Josh into this,

04:53.890 --> 04:56.450
so I don't see how
we have much of a choice.

04:56.530 --> 04:57.952
I love him too, Nora,

04:58.030 --> 05:01.455
and he saved me more
times than I can count.

05:01.530 --> 05:02.964
(Crickets chirping)

05:03.030 --> 05:05.089
You have to
let me help him.

05:05.170 --> 05:07.298
(Inhaling)

05:17.210 --> 05:20.043
(Train horn blaring)

05:22.950 --> 05:24.782
(Gulls squawking)

05:24.850 --> 05:27.854
- It's good to see you.
Did I say that?

05:27.920 --> 05:31.129
- You haven't said
anything, really.

05:31.190 --> 05:34.455
- Oh, it's the first sentence
I keep tripping over, then.

05:34.530 --> 05:36.692
(Sighing)

05:39.870 --> 05:42.464
It's a little
strange, isn't it?

05:42.540 --> 05:44.338
- Just a little.

05:46.740 --> 05:50.779
All this time, I...

05:50.850 --> 05:54.480
I never imagined you
wearing a leather jacket.

05:54.550 --> 05:57.019
(Chuckles)

05:57.090 --> 06:00.185
- Uh, yeah, I guess
I've been in a rut

06:00.260 --> 06:03.082
for the last
couple of decades.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.879
- You speak differently.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.655
- You're wearing pants.

06:07.730 --> 06:08.891
(Chuckles)

06:08.960 --> 06:11.429
- It has been
a really long time.

06:13.870 --> 06:17.636
- Suzanna...

06:17.710 --> 06:21.806
What happened to you,
uh, on that riverbank,

06:21.880 --> 06:24.178
you didn't deserve that.

06:24.250 --> 06:28.175
And, look, I just
gotta ask you.

06:28.250 --> 06:30.981
What-- How did this--
How did this happen?

06:31.050 --> 06:32.609
Who?

06:37.860 --> 06:40.795
- (Reverend):
Save your soul!

06:40.860 --> 06:43.192
Renounce the monster who
is now your husband!

06:43.270 --> 06:44.829
- I will not!

06:52.610 --> 06:56.604
- Isaac, wait here.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.705
(Panting)

06:58.780 --> 07:02.080
Suzanna!
Oh! Oh! Oh!

07:05.750 --> 07:07.252
(Sobs)

07:07.320 --> 07:09.209
(Women screaming)

07:09.290 --> 07:11.486
(Grunting)

07:15.300 --> 07:17.496
(Roaring)

07:28.940 --> 07:31.204
(Gulls squawking)

07:35.720 --> 07:37.040
(Gasps)

07:38.790 --> 07:40.884
(Coughing)

07:42.930 --> 07:44.728
- Welcome back, lovely!

07:46.060 --> 07:47.926
- The river!

07:48.000 --> 07:51.163
It was my end!

07:51.230 --> 07:53.540
The reverend...

07:53.600 --> 07:56.467
- The reverend is
a self-righteous fool.

07:58.140 --> 07:59.938
I've been watching you.

08:00.010 --> 08:02.775
I'm sorry your good
friends and neighbours

08:02.850 --> 08:06.206
couldn't see your better
qualities of love and loyalty.

08:06.280 --> 08:09.648
You should know that those
elevated by an enlightened mind

08:09.720 --> 08:14.658
are often times forced to pay the
ultimate price in this world.

08:14.720 --> 08:17.280
You are a good woman,
Suzanna Waite,

08:17.360 --> 08:20.159
and if you do
exactly as I say,

08:20.230 --> 08:24.064
I will reunite you
with your husband.

08:27.970 --> 08:30.166
- You...

08:30.240 --> 08:32.163
You--you are the demon

08:32.240 --> 08:35.232
who visited this
plague on my family!

08:36.710 --> 08:41.113
Who robbed Aidan
of his humanity.

08:41.179 --> 08:43.342
- I celebrate
his humanity!

08:43.419 --> 08:45.343
As did you.

08:45.420 --> 08:48.219
Do you really
think him a monster,

08:48.290 --> 08:50.224
the man you took
into your bed

08:50.290 --> 08:52.258
and fed by your vein?

08:57.200 --> 08:59.020
- Monster.

09:00.340 --> 09:03.935
Then I too?

09:04.010 --> 09:05.034
- We are the same.

09:06.270 --> 09:09.672
Strong, powerful
beyond measure.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.969
Freed from the bonds
of immortal life.

09:12.050 --> 09:15.213
The love you share with Aidan
can burn for an eternity.

09:15.280 --> 09:18.250
Precious few
have that chance.

09:18.320 --> 09:21.813
- Aidan despises
who he is,

09:21.890 --> 09:23.984
what you made him!

09:24.060 --> 09:27.223
He would prefer I lay
still in a watery grave.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.359
He will mourn his wife.

09:29.430 --> 09:32.968
- I assure you that these
feelings will pass away

09:33.040 --> 09:34.098
upon your first reunion.

09:34.170 --> 09:35.137
(Groans)

09:35.200 --> 09:38.704
Ours is an easy life.

09:38.770 --> 09:41.740
The only hardship we face
is the pursuit of food.

09:41.810 --> 09:46.304
This feeling you have now, this
hunger, it's only going to grow.

09:46.380 --> 09:48.747
You must feed and soon.

09:48.820 --> 09:52.882
There is a village up the road.
Come, I will teach you.

09:52.960 --> 09:56.157
When we've had our fill,
we will find our Aidan.

09:57.460 --> 09:59.280
(Whimpers)

09:59.360 --> 10:01.954
- [--I cannot!

10:05.200 --> 10:07.294
I will not!

10:12.010 --> 10:14.877
- Why must they always run?

10:26.490 --> 10:31.758
(* Foe singing

I pick up my phone *

10:37.000 --> 10:41.870
* Call a number
that I make up on the spot *

10:41.940 --> 10:45.763
* Your voice is so small
Your voice is so cold *

10:45.840 --> 10:49.208
* But as long as there is
someone for my ears to hold *

10:49.280 --> 10:53.877
* Deep in those sheets
We travel through darkness... *

10:53.950 --> 10:55.042
- There's nothing here.

10:58.190 --> 11:03.185
* You told me: "Don't scream
or you'll ruin the speakers" *

11:03.260 --> 11:08.755
* As long as I am here to keep
you out of the bleakness *

11:08.830 --> 11:10.924
I can touch the ground.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.129
* Out of the bleakness *

11:14.200 --> 11:17.261
* Cause that is your weakness *

11:17.340 --> 11:21.129
*T'll get you out of it *

11:23.480 --> 11:26.780
(Chuckling)

11:26.850 --> 11:29.012
* Breaking in sweats... *

11:29.080 --> 11:30.445
OK, a little on the nose,

11:30.520 --> 11:33.160
what with the leather of it all.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.349
Oh no!

11:38.290 --> 11:40.395
Come on!

11:40.460 --> 11:42.224
(Whispering):
Come on.

11:43.830 --> 11:45.389

* Out of the bleakness *

11:49.940 --> 11:51.465

11:51.540 --> 11:54.134
* 'Cause that is
my weakness *

11:54.210 --> 11:56.474
* You keep me out of it **

11:59.150 --> 12:00.470
(Laughing)

12:04.250 --> 12:06.548
- You were the
first casualty

12:06.620 --> 12:10.284
in an endless stream of
consequences for what I became.

12:10.360 --> 12:13.853
- Well, I welcomed you
back home. That was my choice.

12:13.930 --> 12:15.056
- Yes.

12:15.130 --> 12:16.256
- No one forced me to.

12:16.330 --> 12:18.196
- But I made
you promises.

12:18.270 --> 12:20.466
I did. In that white
clapboard meeting house,

12:20.540 --> 12:22.463
I promised to love you,
to honour you.

12:22.540 --> 12:25.908
- Well, the girl who's owed
that apology is long dead.

12:25.970 --> 12:28.109
- Yeah, but
I didn't honour you.

12:29.410 --> 12:34.018
Suzanna, the day
that you died,

12:34.080 --> 12:35.809
I abandoned your son...

12:38.020 --> 12:40.284
to avenge you.

12:42.060 --> 12:44.984
It's 200 years.

12:45.060 --> 12:49.429
And in all that time, I have
never been brave enough

12:49.500 --> 12:53.937
to learn what
became of our boy.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.504
- I was scared too.

12:57.570 --> 13:02.132
I mean, he was
left an orphan.

13:03.680 --> 13:06.172
But he died
a grandfather.

13:10.050 --> 13:11.381
(Sighing)

13:15.590 --> 13:17.524
(Chuckling)

13:21.600 --> 13:24.319
I am so glad
to see you again.

13:24.400 --> 13:27.370
- I wanted to see you too.

13:27.440 --> 13:28.999
- Then why did you--

13:29.070 --> 13:30.003
(Scoffs)

13:30.070 --> 13:31.606
Why did you stay away?

13:31.670 --> 13:34.537
- Aidan!
Check it! Check it!

13:34.610 --> 13:36.601
Oh, oh, oh!
- That's impressive, Sally.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.603
- Right, right, right?

13:38.680 --> 13:41.012
Look at this. Look.

13:41.080 --> 13:43.082
I'm a ghost,
just reading a book,

13:43.150 --> 13:45.141
like I do,
turning the pages,

13:45.220 --> 13:47.518
you know,
with my hands!

13:47.590 --> 13:49.012
(Laughing)

13:49.090 --> 13:50.580
Who's this?
I thought you came back

13:50.660 --> 13:52.082
to spend the
night with Kat.

13:52.160 --> 13:53.298
- I did.

13:53.360 --> 13:56.091
- Who's this
glossy-haired long face?

13:56.160 --> 13:58.299
- Hi! I'm--

13:58.370 --> 14:01.465
- She's an old
friend of mine.

14:01.540 --> 14:03.201
- You can see me?
- (Aidan): Yeah.

14:03.270 --> 14:05.238
And you know what
normal people can see?

14:05.310 --> 14:07.938
A floating book. Check it out,
everyone. Go, surreal!

14:08.010 --> 14:09.944
Please be subtle.
- What are you?

14:10.010 --> 14:12.502
I was serious about
your hair. It's nice.

14:12.580 --> 14:15.277
- No, focus.
Where did you get this?

14:15.350 --> 14:18.183
- It's Donna's. It's what
I'm gonna use to help Josh.

14:18.250 --> 14:21.254
I suggest you cut the side dish
loose and meet us in the woods.

14:21.320 --> 14:22.458
- Ho-hold it!

14:22.520 --> 14:24.420
(Birds chirping)

14:24.490 --> 14:27.494
- What time does the sun set?
- Hold on.

14:27.560 --> 14:29.050
Can we please, for a minute,

14:29.130 --> 14:30.996
pretend that
we are rational people

14:31.070 --> 14:33.164
with a healthy mistrust
of the metaphysical?

14:33.240 --> 14:35.060
- (Nora): 7:57.
- What?

14:35.140 --> 14:37.268
- Sun tracker app.

14:37.340 --> 14:39.001
It really takes the guesswork

14:39.070 --> 14:41.505
out of that whole "what time
to hang the ham hock" game.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.173
- We don't have
a lot of time.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.002
- Till what?
- The moonrise.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.720
- The moonrise! You have
an appointment at a day spa

14:47.780 --> 14:49.612
and you come back
very, very cocky.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.944
- I can do this spell, Aidan.
- Can you?

14:52.020 --> 14:55.320
- You should thank me, because
finally, one of us can help him.

14:55.390 --> 14:57.256
- Do you hear what
you're saying?

14:57.330 --> 14:59.549
We're taking Josh's
life into our hands.

14:59.630 --> 15:01.098
- Do you have
better ideas?

15:01.160 --> 15:04.221
- This is way too big
to put your faith in.

15:04.300 --> 15:06.689
I love her to death,
and she's great at things

15:06.770 --> 15:09.364
like straightening her hair
and dental hygiene,

15:09.440 --> 15:11.534
but this is a
whole different thing.

15:11.610 --> 15:14.079
- I'm sitting right here.

15:14.140 --> 15:15.630
- Using spells
to solve problems

15:15.710 --> 15:18.441
only leads to other,
usually bigger problems.

15:18.510 --> 15:21.969
Have you forgotten about the
time you bit my stomach off?

15:22.050 --> 15:23.518
- Stop it, OK?

15:23.590 --> 15:25.012
- I'm sorry!

15:25.090 --> 15:27.684
- I'm just as scared
as you are. More!

15:27.760 --> 15:29.387
But we have
to do something.

15:29.460 --> 15:30.985
- We're trying
to do something,

15:31.060 --> 15:32.687
but does this
have to be tonight?

15:32.760 --> 15:35.229
- We're losing him,
more every day.

15:35.300 --> 15:37.689
And the moon is, I don't know,
waning or something.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.193
- It's waning, yeah.

15:40.270 --> 15:42.659
- Waning. So, apparently
tonight is the night.

15:42.740 --> 15:45.163
- It's all
in here.

15:45.240 --> 15:47.379
I was meant to find this.
You can't deny it.

15:47.440 --> 15:50.171
This sucker's heavy and
I can't even pick up a pencil.

15:50.250 --> 15:53.220
- Using Donna's witchcraft might
bring Josh back. It might.

15:53.280 --> 15:56.511
I can admit to not understanding
that kind of power,

15:56.580 --> 15:59.311
but also, something
could go very, very wrong.

15:59.390 --> 16:00.755
You're his wife.

16:00.820 --> 16:02.709
Are you willing to
take that kind of risk?

16:02.790 --> 16:05.179
Because it really
shouldn't be up to us.

16:06.490 --> 16:09.460
(Sighing)

16:12.230 --> 16:14.335
- Let's do this.

16:25.380 --> 16:28.441
No Webelos, no necking teens.
I'm so tired of running.

16:28.520 --> 16:31.114
- I'm not really sure how all
of this is gonna go down,

16:31.190 --> 16:33.215
but I'm guessing
it's gonna get screamy.

16:33.290 --> 16:35.611
- Great, so you gonna
fill us in on the plan?

16:35.690 --> 16:38.079
What is this kiddy pool
doing here, for example?

16:38.160 --> 16:40.356
- That's for the spell.
- Of course it is.

16:40.430 --> 16:44.526
- OK, so, the key to getting
Josh back is the moon.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.762
I mean, Josh is still
human once a month,

16:46.830 --> 16:48.639
when the moon is full.

16:48.700 --> 16:51.635
That means that the wolf hasn't
taken him, not all the way.

16:51.710 --> 16:54.372
- Josh's transformation
is tied to the lunar cycle.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.272
- We already know
that, Sally.

16:56.340 --> 16:59.640
- The moon is waning. Witches
and the moon have a connection.

16:59.710 --> 17:01.109
During different phases,

17:01.180 --> 17:02.648
different spells
are more powerful.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.815
Why are you looking
at me like that, Aidan?

17:05.890 --> 17:07.255
- I'm sorry!

17:07.319 --> 17:08.617
- During the waning phase

17:08.690 --> 17:10.521
is when we cast spells
of banishment,

17:10.589 --> 17:13.252
to dispel what we no longer wish
to be burdened by.

17:13.329 --> 17:15.651
- We? OK, "we cast
spells of banishment."

17:15.730 --> 17:17.528
It just sounds
very Jonestown.

17:17.599 --> 17:21.388
- Could we get through this?
- I'm just saying.

17:21.470 --> 17:22.631
- Sally, carry on.

17:22.700 --> 17:24.406
- Oh, I'm actually done.

17:24.470 --> 17:26.632
Harness the moon's power,
fight the wolf,

17:26.710 --> 17:28.701
Thanks, big magic book!

17:28.780 --> 17:31.545
- So, what else?
- What?

17:31.610 --> 17:34.272
- What else? We need a bat wing
or a lizard's scale

17:34.350 --> 17:35.772
or a heart of a
dude you killed?

17:35.850 --> 17:38.285
- Really?
- Sorry.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.557
- Blood. We just--
We need blood.

17:40.620 --> 17:42.156
- We don't have any blood.

17:42.220 --> 17:43.779
You should've told me this

17:43.860 --> 17:46.682
before I left the house
that has a fridge full of it.

17:46.760 --> 17:49.821
- Not that kind of blood.
We need something more potent.

17:49.900 --> 17:52.619
Sacred blood.
Blood of the Goddess.

17:55.870 --> 17:56.860
- What?

17:56.940 --> 17:59.307
Ugh, just say it!

17:59.370 --> 18:01.839
What kind of poor, woodland
creature do I have to murder

18:01.910 --> 18:03.344
with my bare hands

18:03.410 --> 18:05.447
just to make the spell work?

18:05.510 --> 18:08.616
- We need a gal who's Aunt Flo's
making her monthly visit.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.842
) IT Eww!
m sorry!

18:10.920 --> 18:12.615
The women's cycle
is also tied

18:12.690 --> 18:14.715
to the lunar cycle,
as it happens,

18:14.790 --> 18:18.158
and we just need the blood
to harness the moon's power!

18:18.230 --> 18:20.449
(Sally and Aidan sighing)

18:20.530 --> 18:22.225
- What?

18:22.300 --> 18:25.600
- Um... I can smell it?

18:25.670 --> 18:27.889
- Oh God!
- I'm sorry! Nora...

18:27.970 --> 18:29.631
- Oh my God!
- I'm horrified!

18:29.700 --> 18:32.601
- So, is that, like,
an ongoing skill set?

18:32.670 --> 18:34.172
- No! Well...

18:34.240 --> 18:35.730
- As in, all the time
I've known you,

18:35.810 --> 18:38.472
- and all the time we've
lived together, you could...

18:38.550 --> 18:40.848
- It comes with the territory
of being a vampire!

18:40.920 --> 18:42.740
There's not much
I can do about that!

18:42.820 --> 18:46.484
- Great! Good to know.
So, do I just--

18:46.550 --> 18:48.757
- Try to shoot for 5-7 ml.

18:48.820 --> 18:50.720
- (Aidan): Anh!
- OK!

18:50.790 --> 18:53.498
- No, no, no!
No, no. No.

18:53.560 --> 18:55.619
(Bird chirping)

19:03.570 --> 19:08.770
- As much as I respect what
it is you just had to do,

19:08.840 --> 19:11.639
unfortunately, I can
only hold this book.

19:11.710 --> 19:14.509
- Right. T'll just keep
holding onto it, then.

19:14.580 --> 19:16.344
- OK.

19:16.420 --> 19:17.888
(Crickets chirping)

19:20.460 --> 19:22.258
(Sighing)

19:22.320 --> 19:23.879
(Speaking foreign language)

19:23.960 --> 19:26.281
(Wind blowing)

19:29.430 --> 19:31.660
(Speaking foreign language)

19:37.370 --> 19:38.929
OK.

19:40.780 --> 19:43.306
(Sighing)

19:46.610 --> 19:48.942
(Sally speaking
foreign language)

19:52.850 --> 19:55.717
- Oh!

20:00.500 --> 20:03.265
(Foreign language)

20:10.770 --> 20:12.568
- OK, let's go.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.301
(Nora sighing)

20:14.380 --> 20:15.939
- Yeah.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.000
(Growling)

20:20.080 --> 20:22.970
(Foreign language)

20:23.050 --> 20:24.984
- Oh my God!

20:25.050 --> 20:27.485
(Foreign language)

20:27.560 --> 20:29.415
Sally!
What are you doing?

20:29.490 --> 20:32.858
We have to keep him still. The
dagger has to enter his heart.

20:32.930 --> 20:34.591
- What?
- Excuse me?

20:34.660 --> 20:36.697
- You never said anything
about stabbing!

20:36.760 --> 20:39.320
- It's not him!
- This is insane!

20:39.400 --> 20:42.597
- He won't feel a thing.
Give me the trang gun.

20:42.670 --> 20:44.707
- No. He has
to be awake.

20:44.770 --> 20:47.501
- Come on! What's next?
Are we gonna light him on fire?

20:47.580 --> 20:49.230
- Let me do it.

20:50.810 --> 20:53.006
- No, no. Nora!

20:53.080 --> 20:54.616
(Snarling)

20:59.820 --> 21:03.484
- Just stay calm, OK?

21:05.790 --> 21:09.522
That's it.
Just stay calm.

21:09.600 --> 21:12.399
Josh?

21:12.470 --> 21:15.496
(Whispering):
That's it.

21:15.570 --> 21:18.335
I'm so sorry.

21:18.410 --> 21:20.060
(Snarling, dagger clattering)

21:20.140 --> 21:21.938
Oh! An!

21:22.010 --> 21:23.375
- (Sally): Ah!

21:23.450 --> 21:26.602
(Werewolf yelping)

21:30.890 --> 21:33.655
(All panting)

21:33.720 --> 21:37.554
- No. No, Josh.
What happened?

21:37.630 --> 21:39.052
Where are you?

21:39.130 --> 21:41.656
Please, please, please!
Come back, Josh.

21:41.730 --> 21:44.791
Sally, why isn't it working?

21:44.870 --> 21:48.659
- Please tell me I didn't
just kill my best friend.

21:50.040 --> 21:52.065
- Sally?

21:52.140 --> 21:54.404
- Guys?

21:54.480 --> 21:56.903
Guys, where are you?

21:56.980 --> 21:59.506
- What happened?
Where is she?

21:59.580 --> 22:01.571
- She's gone again.
She can't control it!

22:01.650 --> 22:03.448
Aidan, why did
I let her do this?

22:03.520 --> 22:05.784
- We gotta find her. Sally!
- Sally!

22:05.850 --> 22:07.579
Sally!

22:07.660 --> 22:08.957
- Guys?

22:18.930 --> 22:24.608
OK. This is definitely an
upgrade from the snuff film.

22:26.770 --> 22:30.445
- Aidan?
Aidan, what happened?

22:30.510 --> 22:31.978
- Where's Josh?
Aidan!

22:32.050 --> 22:34.109
Are you sleeping?

22:34.180 --> 22:38.447
- So, this layer of scum around
the kitchen sink is truly epic.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.852
- Josh. Josh!

22:40.920 --> 22:42.479
- Aaah!

22:42.560 --> 22:44.585
- You said you'd be
in here doing windows.

22:44.660 --> 22:45.889
- Ow!
- I'm sorry.

22:45.960 --> 22:48.122
Did my little
slap hurt you?

22:48.200 --> 22:50.862
Oh, right, you eat people,
so you're probably fine.

22:50.930 --> 22:53.467
- My idea of clean and yours,
not the same thing.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.861
- Because you grew up in
an early American mud shack

22:55.940 --> 22:57.135
with a dirt floor.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.134
- No, but in the
1700s, we caught on

22:59.210 --> 23:01.975
to the idea of wood
as a building material.

23:02.040 --> 23:03.872
- This happened!

23:03.950 --> 23:05.839
- I'm worried that
this was a mistake.

23:05.910 --> 23:08.618
- All of this,
this already happened.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.045
- We've had the
keys for 7 hours.

23:10.120 --> 23:11.485
- We're not "vibe-ing."

23:11.550 --> 23:13.587
We're not!

23:13.660 --> 23:15.185
I need someone
I can vibe with.

23:15.260 --> 23:16.989
- Josh, I'll do
the windows.

23:17.060 --> 23:18.653
- That's all
I'm asking!

23:18.730 --> 23:21.028
- On one condition:
Leave my blood supply alone.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.626
- Well, I'm not drinking it.
- You're organizing it!

23:23.700 --> 23:24.861
- We need a system!

23:24.930 --> 23:26.591
- (Aidan):
It's blood in bags!

23:26.670 --> 23:28.889
Martha Stewart hasn't
really weighed in on that.

23:28.970 --> 23:31.769
- (Josh): Look, it's something
I enjoy! It relaxes me!

23:31.840 --> 23:33.160
(Aidan talking, indistinct)

23:33.240 --> 23:34.901
- I thought I made that clear!

23:34.980 --> 23:37.176
- What if I'm prepping
for a dinner party...

23:37.240 --> 23:38.708
(Josh talking, indistinct)

23:42.950 --> 23:45.783
- I'm travelling through time.

23:55.030 --> 23:57.465
(Sighing)

23:59.030 --> 24:01.590
- I'm sorry.

24:04.940 --> 24:06.829
(Gasps)

24:06.910 --> 24:08.571
Uh, Nora?

24:08.640 --> 24:10.677
Nora!

24:15.950 --> 24:18.681
(Grunting)

24:18.750 --> 24:20.115
Nora! Nora!

24:20.190 --> 24:23.080
- Oh my God! Josh!

24:23.160 --> 24:25.151
Oh my God! Josh!

24:25.230 --> 24:26.527
(Grunting)

24:30.300 --> 24:31.961
(Josh grunting)

24:37.100 --> 24:39.239
(Groaning)

24:46.110 --> 24:47.248
Oh my God!

24:47.310 --> 24:49.039
It's OK!

24:49.120 --> 24:51.748
I'm here!

24:51.820 --> 24:53.857
You're safe now.
Do you hear me?

24:53.920 --> 24:55.251
(Groaning)

24:55.320 --> 24:59.052
We'll always keep you safe.

24:59.130 --> 25:01.599
(* Man and woman vocalizing *)

25:04.730 --> 25:06.789
(Siren in distance)

25:17.850 --> 25:20.000
Here you go!

25:20.080 --> 25:25.041
Your blend, and it's loaded with
honey, just the way you like it.

25:25.120 --> 25:26.645
(Sighing)

25:26.720 --> 25:29.087
There's not really any
food in the house though.

25:29.160 --> 25:30.889
I've only been sleeping here

25:30.960 --> 25:33.895
when I work back-to-back
days at the hospital.

25:33.960 --> 25:35.928
Aidan and I kind of
worked out a schedule,

25:36.000 --> 25:37.889
but I can go out
and get you something.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.199
Anything you want!

25:39.270 --> 25:41.329
Even that jerky that's
so high in nitrates

25:41.400 --> 25:43.767
that it's too dangerous
for human consumption,

25:43.840 --> 25:46.605
you know, if that's
what you wanted.

25:48.240 --> 25:50.948
- I don't think I
can eat right now.

25:51.010 --> 25:54.241
- Right. Uh, well,
that's--that's OK!

25:54.320 --> 25:58.746
Do you, uh, do you just
wanna, maybe, go to bed?

26:00.120 --> 26:01.315
(Sniffling)

26:01.390 --> 26:02.983
- Is it time for bed?

26:04.290 --> 26:07.794
- I'm sorry! I'm--
I don't know what to do.

26:07.860 --> 26:12.263
I'm so happy you're home,
and I want to take care of you!

26:12.330 --> 26:16.039
- Yeah, I know! You are!

26:17.870 --> 26:20.202
Nora, it's just..

26:20.270 --> 26:21.874
(Whooshing)

26:21.940 --> 26:23.942
- Sally!

26:24.010 --> 26:25.239
- You're here!

26:25.310 --> 26:27.813
- What keeps happening to you?

26:27.880 --> 26:30.747
- Well, I can't just-- Why--
How are you here right now?

26:30.820 --> 26:33.881
I left you all in the woods
with an impaled werewolf corpse.

26:33.960 --> 26:37.089
- Well, you were gone!
We didn't know what to do!

26:37.160 --> 26:40.949
So when Aidan realized that
Josh was inside of the wolf,

26:41.030 --> 26:43.226
we just-- we pulled him out!

26:43.300 --> 26:44.859
- You pulled him out?

26:44.930 --> 26:47.297
- Yeah! And it was really
gross, if you must know,

26:47.370 --> 26:50.237
- I wasn't finished, Nora.
The spell wasn't finished.

26:50.300 --> 26:52.837
You shouldn't have
done anything without me!

26:52.910 --> 26:55.277
Why didn't you just--
- We didn't know where you were!

26:55.340 --> 26:56.774
We couldn't just wait,

26:56.840 --> 26:58.842
not after everything
that he went through!

26:58.910 --> 27:02.244
And besides, even if there
was more to it, Josh is here.

27:02.320 --> 27:05.312
He's home! And it's
all because of you!

27:05.390 --> 27:08.189
- I don't know! I mean,
the magic, it's all so new.

27:08.260 --> 27:11.389
I'm just flying on instinct
here. What if Aidan was right?

27:11.460 --> 27:14.122
Maybe I shouldn't have
messed with everything so soon.

27:14.200 --> 27:18.125
- Listen to me, OK?
You were right. You saved him.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.362
I'm sorry I doubted you.

27:28.940 --> 27:30.772
- You OK?

27:30.850 --> 27:32.739
- I'm here.

27:32.810 --> 27:36.872
- We should be celebrating with
something stronger than tea!

27:36.950 --> 27:38.179
- Yes!

27:39.990 --> 27:41.253
Welcome home!

27:42.990 --> 27:44.754
- Hmm!

27:59.570 --> 28:02.278
(Exhaling, knocking on door)

28:09.280 --> 28:10.918
- Aidan?

28:10.990 --> 28:12.310
- Hi, I know it's late. Um...

28:12.390 --> 28:13.949
- How did you find me here?

28:14.020 --> 28:16.819
- Oh, I only had to
call a few hotels.

28:16.890 --> 28:20.087
I knew that you would
want something with history.

28:20.160 --> 28:24.324
Uh, but we didn't really get to
finish our talk the other day,

28:24.400 --> 28:27.392
and there's a lot left
to be said, don't you think?

28:29.000 --> 28:31.037
- Sorry! Um, come in!

28:32.440 --> 28:35.205
I don't really get to
do a lot of inviting,

28:35.280 --> 28:38.204
so it kind of saps the
etiquette out of a girl.

28:38.280 --> 28:39.805
(Laughing)

28:50.420 --> 28:54.357
- Yeah! Actually, things
seem to be on the upswing.

28:54.430 --> 28:56.228
Thank you for asking.

28:56.300 --> 28:57.790
(Sighing)

28:57.870 --> 29:02.933
Um, I guess, I just
needed to ask you again...

29:03.000 --> 29:04.308
- Why I stayed away?

29:04.370 --> 29:06.464
- And I know that I might
not have the right--

29:06.540 --> 29:10.374
- No, that's not true.
Of course, you do.

29:10.440 --> 29:13.501
I made promises to you.

29:13.580 --> 29:17.539
- So why didn't we...
We--we could've tried,

29:17.620 --> 29:20.339
tried to build a life together,

29:20.420 --> 29:24.357
and no matter how perverted
an existence it might've been,

29:24.430 --> 29:27.252
it still would've been us.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.489
- No...

29:30.560 --> 29:34.098
Not with Bishop by your side.

29:35.200 --> 29:36.861
When he turned me,

29:36.940 --> 29:41.002
he said it was a gift for you...

29:41.080 --> 29:43.276
(Scoffs)

29:43.340 --> 29:46.105
...but you know that
Bishop is a brutal man

29:46.180 --> 29:49.115
and he mistreated me.

29:49.180 --> 29:52.889
I would rather not
talk about it.

29:52.950 --> 29:57.512
He decided I was
not worthy of his son,

29:57.590 --> 30:01.197
and I had no choice
but to believe him.

30:01.260 --> 30:03.524
I got the sense that a son

30:03.600 --> 30:06.023
was worth a lot more
to him than a daughter.

30:08.400 --> 30:13.566
- It, uh, it was
a complicated relationship,

30:13.640 --> 30:16.280
and it was all
the way till the end.

30:17.540 --> 30:20.077
- I didn't believe it

30:20.150 --> 30:23.211
when I heard that he was dead,

30:23.280 --> 30:27.080
till they told me that you
were the one that killed him.

30:30.360 --> 30:32.954
- I know that this,

30:33.030 --> 30:36.421
you and me here, is a lot,

30:36.500 --> 30:41.495
but with Bishop gone and the
virus nearly wiping us out,

30:41.570 --> 30:43.390
I had to come back home.

30:45.170 --> 30:49.903
There was just too many
unanswered questions.

30:49.980 --> 30:52.449
And I really meant

30:52.510 --> 30:56.117
what I said to you
all those years ago.

30:56.180 --> 30:59.184
I wanted you to go
on with your life.

30:59.250 --> 31:02.618
I just didn't know that death
would take me from you so soon.

31:02.690 --> 31:05.660
- Hold on for a second.
Can I ask what's going on?

31:05.730 --> 31:07.585
I don't really understand this.

31:07.660 --> 31:10.220
What, we're just gonna
live in the same city,

31:10.300 --> 31:12.496
and we're eventually,
I don't know,

31:12.570 --> 31:16.336
we're gonna settle in to
having a platonic meal together

31:16.400 --> 31:18.232
or however many
brunches it takes

31:18.310 --> 31:22.133
for 2 people to catch up on
the past 2 centuries. Is that...

31:22.210 --> 31:25.942
- I think we just let
the past stay in the past.

31:27.450 --> 31:29.270
Look, you have friends.

31:29.350 --> 31:33.412
You have a home, a whole life,

31:33.490 --> 31:36.380
something of your own.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.584
And I'm really glad!

31:46.700 --> 31:48.134
Good night, Aidan.

31:57.740 --> 31:59.276
(Door closing)

32:13.090 --> 32:14.398
(Sighing)

32:22.240 --> 32:25.130
- Mmm... Hey!
- Hey!

32:26.370 --> 32:28.031
- Gripping stuff!

32:28.110 --> 32:32.047
- Evidently! I'm really
sorry to wake you up,

32:32.110 --> 32:34.340
but you're in my bed, so...

32:35.650 --> 32:37.709
- Nora let me in.
- Ah!

32:37.780 --> 32:41.057
- Oh, I saw Josh!
Nora seems so happy!

32:41.120 --> 32:42.588
(Sighing)

32:42.660 --> 32:45.425
It's great news about
his mom pulling through.

32:45.490 --> 32:48.198
- Oh my God, yeah!
Totally awesome!

32:48.260 --> 32:50.695
- I wanted to surprise you.

32:54.370 --> 32:55.189
What?

32:58.310 --> 33:00.108
OK, it's not as
awesome a reveal

33:00.170 --> 33:01.638
when there's
highlighter ink

33:01.710 --> 33:05.169
smeared all over the upper
portion of my body, but...

33:05.250 --> 33:09.209
(Laughing): Where
were you? Nora wasn't sure.

33:09.280 --> 33:11.214
- Uh, I was out for a walk.

33:11.290 --> 33:13.748
I kind of figured
I'd let the newlyweds,

33:13.820 --> 33:16.050
you know, have a little space.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.259
- Right!
- And...

33:18.330 --> 33:22.324
You know, Kat, I've just been
doing some thinking. Um...

33:23.430 --> 33:24.659
- Hmm!

33:24.730 --> 33:26.789
- Kat, this routine
that we have,

33:26.870 --> 33:30.465
me coming home to you
and reading together in bed,

33:30.540 --> 33:33.237
and me making you
coffee in the morning,

33:33.310 --> 33:34.675
it's become this...

33:34.740 --> 33:37.380
- Oh boy! We're there!

33:37.440 --> 33:39.545
I think this is the
fastest I've plummeted

33:39.610 --> 33:41.112
from sexy, fun-loving couple

33:41.180 --> 33:43.069
to the read-the-
newspaper-in-silence

33:43.150 --> 33:44.686
-over-the-breakfast
-table couple.

33:44.750 --> 33:48.118
- OK, shhh! What I'm trying
to say is that I like it.

33:51.330 --> 33:53.389
You and me work. We're easy.

33:53.460 --> 33:56.395
And this just
all feels like life!

33:56.460 --> 34:01.398
And not at all boring, but still
a fantastically ordinary...

34:01.470 --> 34:04.235
- Hmm!
- .. life.

34:04.310 --> 34:06.165
- Yeah, with the
occasional twist!

34:06.240 --> 34:07.537
- Kat, I love you.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.405
- Twist!

34:16.580 --> 34:19.686
(Laughing)

34:25.230 --> 34:26.583
(Car horn honking)

34:55.219 --> 34:59.555
(Panting)

35:03.300 --> 35:05.598
(Panting and grunting)

35:05.670 --> 35:07.798
(* Love Overdose

35:07.870 --> 35:09.634

35:21.680 --> 35:23.375
- Aidan?

35:23.450 --> 35:25.487
(Bushes rustling)

35:25.550 --> 35:27.609
- For this moment,

35:27.690 --> 35:31.854
accept your nature as
you once accepted mine.

35:31.930 --> 35:34.399
Feed, my love!

35:34.460 --> 35:36.724
Just this once!

36:44.770 --> 36:47.967
No! No!

36:48.030 --> 36:49.691
(Sobbing)

36:49.770 --> 36:52.660
Oh! Dear God! No!

36:54.880 --> 36:56.837
(Sobbing and screaming)

37:07.650 --> 37:09.857
- He was an orphan.

37:09.920 --> 37:12.628
This could be the better fate.

37:12.690 --> 37:15.330
- He's just a boy!

37:15.400 --> 37:17.550
(Crying)

37:17.630 --> 37:21.464
Save him! I know
that you can!

37:21.540 --> 37:23.998
He could still
be my son!

37:24.070 --> 37:27.335
- I cannot trap him for
an eternity as a child!

37:27.410 --> 37:28.878
(Sobbing)

37:28.940 --> 37:33.309
- Then kill me!
Kill me now!

37:33.380 --> 37:36.020
I cannot live like this!

37:36.080 --> 37:37.969
(Sobbing)

37:38.050 --> 37:42.920
- Of all the praises 1
sing of our existence,

37:42.990 --> 37:45.482
you must understand this:

37:45.560 --> 37:49.394
there is no hope
beyond this life.

37:49.460 --> 37:53.021
That is why we must drink
what we can from this now.

37:53.100 --> 37:55.637
This is our gift!

37:55.700 --> 38:00.035
Beyond this, there is
nothing but damnation.

38:00.110 --> 38:01.874
Do you understand?

38:03.540 --> 38:06.510
- What kind of
life could I have?

38:06.580 --> 38:08.514
(Crying)

38:09.850 --> 38:11.909
- This is not what
I'd planned for you.

38:11.990 --> 38:13.742
(Crying)

38:15.090 --> 38:18.822
You must leave here!
Leave and never return!

38:20.160 --> 38:22.026
- This is my home!

38:23.600 --> 38:24.829
My husband!

38:24.900 --> 38:27.528
- Still thinks you're
dead and honourable!

38:27.600 --> 38:30.763
Aidan is destined
for greatness,

38:30.840 --> 38:34.378
but this, this
would ruin him!

38:36.580 --> 38:37.934
(Sniffling)

38:38.010 --> 38:41.571
- I could not
control myself!

38:41.650 --> 38:45.939
There is a darkness
inside of me.

38:46.020 --> 38:49.854
- How will Aidan receive
the murder of his only son?

38:55.630 --> 38:57.655
Let this blood
be our eternal secret.

38:57.730 --> 38:58.993
It is the only way

38:59.070 --> 39:00.822
to keep Aidan
from feeling the pain

39:00.900 --> 39:02.368
that you are feeling now.

39:07.510 --> 39:10.878
(Sirens wailing)

39:13.910 --> 39:16.447
- Will you just
come to bed already?

39:16.520 --> 39:18.443
- In a minute!

39:18.520 --> 39:21.455
I just want you to have the
most epic sleep of your life.

39:21.520 --> 39:22.851
- The only part
I care about

39:22.920 --> 39:25.719
is the part where
I wake up next to you.

39:25.790 --> 39:28.430
- Well, in that case,
I'm gonna go wash up!

39:30.700 --> 39:32.099
Five minutes!

39:32.170 --> 39:35.470
The guy hasn't slept on
a real mattress in 3 months!

39:35.540 --> 39:36.666
- Captain!

39:37.800 --> 39:39.734
(Laughing)

39:39.810 --> 39:42.131
So, how you holding up?

39:42.210 --> 39:44.542
(Sighing)

39:46.110 --> 39:47.703
- Honestly, I don't even know

39:47.780 --> 39:49.612
how to begin to
answer that question.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.887
- (Laughing): Right!

39:51.950 --> 39:53.440
Well, for example,

39:53.520 --> 39:56.615
are you sick and tired
of everybody asking you

39:56.690 --> 39:58.055
how you're holding up?

39:58.120 --> 39:59.884
(Chuckling)

39:59.960 --> 40:01.030
(Laughing)

40:01.090 --> 40:03.525
- And borderline nauseated

40:03.600 --> 40:06.763
by the idea of one more
well-intended pleasantry.

40:06.830 --> 40:08.867
Don't tell my wife.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.897
- Wife! Squee!

40:10.970 --> 40:12.165
(Laughing)

40:12.240 --> 40:14.607
- That's a nice word!

40:16.580 --> 40:19.902
- So, you know why
I've been away too,

40:19.980 --> 40:22.915
far away, to other places,

40:22.980 --> 40:25.483
other dimensions actually.

40:25.550 --> 40:27.644
A couple times now.

40:27.720 --> 40:30.189
And Josh, I can't even,

40:30.260 --> 40:33.924
I can't even guess at what it
must've been like for you

40:33.990 --> 40:36.550
when the wolf had control,

40:36.630 --> 40:39.520
but I do know that, for me,

40:39.600 --> 40:43.195
there was a lot
of pain involved,

40:43.270 --> 40:44.965
the kind of pain

40:45.040 --> 40:49.079
that you can't begin
to explain to anybody.

40:51.140 --> 40:55.919
So it might take
a bit, and that's OK,

40:55.980 --> 40:58.074
"cause we'll wait.

41:02.160 --> 41:05.255
You would tell me, right,
if there was something wrong?

41:05.330 --> 41:08.823
You know that you can
talk to me about that.

41:15.740 --> 41:17.094
- I'm--I'm exhausted.

41:18.200 --> 41:19.668
- OK!

41:19.740 --> 41:21.834
- I'm just gonna
call it a night.

41:21.910 --> 41:24.800
- OK! OK!

41:24.880 --> 41:26.143
- Sally!

41:27.210 --> 41:28.678
(Sighing)

41:28.750 --> 41:30.809
Thanks for getting me back.

41:30.880 --> 41:33.019
- Hey, you saved me first.

41:34.350 --> 41:37.980
That's what 'bros do!

41:38.060 --> 41:40.586
(* Five Minutes
by Scattered Trees *)

41:40.660 --> 41:45.291
** Take me up
to the surface *

41:45.370 --> 41:47.225
(Sighing)

41:47.300 --> 41:52.739
* Take me up
to the surface *

42:05.820 --> 42:10.610
* I can't relate *

42:10.690 --> 42:14.024
* To what I say *

42:14.090 --> 42:19.995
* 'Cause I'm not
myself, I'm not *

42:20.070 --> 42:24.667
* I'm gone *

42:30.080 --> 42:32.299
(Gasping, panting)

42:32.380 --> 42:37.739
* I'm right here *

42:38.990 --> 42:42.187
* Five minutes at a time *

42:42.260 --> 42:45.321
* I'm gone *

42:47.390 --> 42:53.193
* I can't breathe,
I'm in too deep *

42:53.270 --> 42:59.004
* So take me up
to the surface **
