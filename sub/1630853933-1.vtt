00:52.927 --> 00:54.929
Is that a picture of your family?

00:55.013 --> 00:56.639
Hmm? Uh-huh.

00:57.140 --> 00:59.601
I actually met up
with my oldest son recently.

01:00.643 --> 01:01.519
Mm.

01:01.603 --> 01:06.900
He is an adult now. He has strong eyes.

01:08.193 --> 01:11.654
You know, I don't think
he has any need for his dad.

01:36.137 --> 01:38.515
My, my, my. Let's take a breath here.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.308
Shut it!

01:51.611 --> 01:52.529
Who are you, woman?

01:53.113 --> 01:54.948
I'm an average housewife.

01:58.535 --> 01:59.869
Bastard!

02:19.055 --> 02:20.140
How are you feeling?

02:22.809 --> 02:23.768
Okay.

02:33.361 --> 02:37.115
Wow, who'd have thought
I would meet Ed and Al's father here.

02:37.198 --> 02:41.744
Meeting my sons' teacher here
is quite the surprise.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.956
I hear that you took great care
of them both.

02:45.039 --> 02:46.875
I didn't do very much.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.003
Well, I left.

02:50.086 --> 02:54.174
I was never much of a proper parent
to either of those boys.

02:54.883 --> 03:00.180
Maybe you should've told them goodbye
and talked to them before leaving.

03:01.764 --> 03:04.267
Maybe their grief
wouldn't have taken over.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.312
Then they wouldn't have tried
to bring back their mother.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.525
You're right. I didn't want to drag them
into my problems.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.408
Izumi? What's going on?

03:26.831 --> 03:29.584
Please, Sig, bring around the car.
Quickly.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.587
-Hurry!
-I got it.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.766
Izumi, you've seen the truth, haven't you?

03:52.065 --> 03:54.025
Tell me, what did you give up?

03:57.278 --> 04:00.365
They took some of my organs.

04:01.115 --> 04:03.910
I tried to bring back my dead child.

04:04.953 --> 04:09.457
And then, I was left with a body
that could never have a child.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.752
I see.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.271
It feels better.

04:31.354 --> 04:37.026
I cannot fix what was taken from you
back then, but I reorganized your insides.

04:37.610 --> 04:41.781
Reorganized? And you were shot before…

04:41.864 --> 04:43.324
Just tell me who you are.

04:47.161 --> 04:51.541
You are one of the few people
who opened the Portal of Truth

04:51.624 --> 04:55.086
and managed to return in mostly one piece.

04:56.129 --> 04:59.966
You are probably being targeted
as a candidate for a human sacrifice.

05:01.175 --> 05:04.512
A candidate? What on earth is that?

05:09.559 --> 05:14.314
The promised day will soon be upon us.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.861
If I cannot win, Izumi…

05:21.321 --> 05:25.825
this country and all its people
will be erased.

05:44.635 --> 05:48.389
This really isn't looking good, is it?

05:49.474 --> 05:50.516
Uh-huh.

05:59.317 --> 06:02.028
It can't be! Brother.

06:09.994 --> 06:12.497
What should I do now?

06:13.164 --> 06:15.625
How should I know what you should do?

06:15.708 --> 06:17.710
I think Father will be mad.

06:20.129 --> 06:22.715
Father? You have a father?

06:24.050 --> 06:25.051
We do.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.346
The person who made the Homunculi?

06:29.931 --> 06:31.391
Yes, he knows all.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.727
Then he might know where Brother went.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.145
Probably.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.607
That's right.

06:40.691 --> 06:43.277
Brother isn't necessarily dead.

06:43.861 --> 06:48.741
Get it together, Al! We both promised
to get our bodies back.

06:50.493 --> 06:53.579
Gluttony, take me to your father.

06:59.377 --> 07:02.380
Mr. Scar, wait for me. I only closed up
your wounds temporarily.

07:06.592 --> 07:10.596
I want to know the truth.

07:27.655 --> 07:28.823
Ling!

07:41.961 --> 07:44.338
Kill me.

07:45.506 --> 07:51.429
Please. Kill me.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.933
Please, kill me.

07:56.017 --> 07:59.061
-Watch out!
-I want to die! Save me!

08:19.415 --> 08:20.541
Wait! Hey!

08:21.751 --> 08:25.671
We can get out. Look,
I think we can get out of here.

08:26.297 --> 08:27.924
Help me, Envy!

08:36.390 --> 08:40.520
I had no idea something
this impressive was under Central.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.026
Those are guards.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.947
Don't worry, they won't hurt you
since you're with me.

08:57.203 --> 09:01.749
If the Homunculi are really the ones
in control of this country,

09:01.832 --> 09:04.544
we have to do something to take it back.

09:04.627 --> 09:05.711
Yes.

09:06.295 --> 09:10.675
First, we need to clarify who in
Central Headquarters is a friend or foe.

09:23.312 --> 09:24.897
Mustang!

09:24.981 --> 09:26.315
Lieutenant General Raven.

09:26.399 --> 09:29.777
Yo! How have you been doing?

09:29.860 --> 09:31.904
Fine, thank you.

09:31.988 --> 09:37.076
Hmm. There's something on your mind?

09:37.159 --> 09:39.620
Nothing in particular,

09:39.704 --> 09:44.041
but I'm disturbed by these baseless rumors
going around the headquarters.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.085
Don't worry about rumors.

09:47.670 --> 09:51.507
However, what are you hearing?

09:53.551 --> 09:58.514
Like Scar was seen
feeding a cat with black spots.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.100
That there are humans who don't die.

10:01.726 --> 10:07.273
Or that Führer King Bradley
is actually a Homunculus.

10:18.034 --> 10:21.329
These people spreading this
are quite confused.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.627
The higher ups like you
don't need to be worried.

10:28.252 --> 10:29.295
Gentlemen.

10:30.046 --> 10:34.884
Colonel Mustang has told me
something very interesting.

10:35.676 --> 10:37.511
Wait till you hear this.

10:40.723 --> 10:43.517
What was that joke

10:44.685 --> 10:46.312
you just told me?

10:48.314 --> 10:51.108
The Führer is…

10:54.403 --> 10:57.907
…actually a Homunculus?

11:03.954 --> 11:07.291
What's wrong, Colonel Mustang?

11:10.461 --> 11:15.132
What have you heard
about me being a Homunculus?

11:19.679 --> 11:22.390
Is there a problem?

11:38.614 --> 11:40.950
Father, I'm back!

11:41.033 --> 11:44.578
I brought a sacrifice. He's here for you.

11:50.167 --> 11:51.585
Who did you bring?

11:53.587 --> 11:54.755
Dad?

12:02.179 --> 12:03.806
That should be everything.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.934
Just as I thought.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.479
This is a human transmutation circle,

12:11.105 --> 12:13.107
but the base represents a regular human.

12:16.193 --> 12:17.862
What does that mean?

12:18.821 --> 12:21.782
So, I had an idea.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.536
You can't perform human transmutation
on the dead,

12:26.620 --> 12:29.707
but what if you transmuted a person
who was still alive?

12:30.624 --> 12:31.542
Mm?

12:32.585 --> 12:34.795
Basically, there's a chance

12:34.879 --> 12:38.466
I might be able to perform
a human transmutation on myself.

12:39.592 --> 12:43.888
And because of the human transmutation,
the door will open.

12:46.098 --> 12:50.519
So we'll be able to get out of here, then,
if the real portal opens up?

12:51.896 --> 12:53.522
What if it fails?

12:54.774 --> 12:56.317
It rebounds.

12:57.526 --> 13:01.781
In the worst case, we perish.

13:03.824 --> 13:06.285
But we die if we don't do anything.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.497
All right, let's get to it then, guys.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.176
Let's go.

13:34.271 --> 13:36.649
Go ahead, Ling. Jump in.

13:36.732 --> 13:39.109
I'm trusting you.

13:39.985 --> 13:42.071
Damn alchemist!

14:11.183 --> 14:13.978
Good. I made it.

14:54.643 --> 14:56.145
Al!

14:56.812 --> 14:58.606
Al!

15:01.775 --> 15:04.820
Al! Quick, let's go!

15:05.779 --> 15:09.825
I can't go. I need to have my actual soul.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.369
So I can't leave.

15:21.879 --> 15:23.088
Alphonse!

15:24.798 --> 15:26.926
I promise to come back for you.

15:28.218 --> 15:29.261
Wait here.

15:51.575 --> 15:52.409
Brother!

15:53.869 --> 15:56.747
Oh, look. This means…

15:57.623 --> 15:59.208
We made it.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.130
Brother! You're okay!

16:05.214 --> 16:08.425
That hurts, Al. Calm down.

16:09.969 --> 16:14.056
You're alive. Thank goodness.

16:17.851 --> 16:18.769
I'm sorry.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.315
I worried you.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.737
Metal arm and leg,

16:30.155 --> 16:31.323
and armor.

16:33.701 --> 16:38.038
You must be the Elric brothers.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.457
Hohenheim?

16:41.458 --> 16:42.710
Hmm?

16:44.044 --> 16:45.295
Hohenheim?

16:48.465 --> 16:51.093
Van Hohenheim, you mean?

16:53.053 --> 16:56.223
How exactly do you know of that man?

16:57.766 --> 17:00.519
Technically, he's our father.

17:09.361 --> 17:12.281
What a surprise.

17:13.407 --> 17:17.077
He was actually able to have children?

17:21.248 --> 17:24.209
Okay. Okay.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.005
In that case,

17:28.964 --> 17:35.345
you must take care of those bodies
until the promised day finally arrives.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.599
Oh.

17:43.937 --> 17:47.024
What are you? It's wrong.

17:47.608 --> 17:51.278
There are many inside of you. Too many.

17:53.655 --> 17:54.656
Ah.

17:55.532 --> 17:59.828
Wrath mentioned you.
You're the Xing prince, huh?

18:01.663 --> 18:04.416
Gluttony, you may eat him.

18:05.876 --> 18:10.047
Whoa, hold on. This man is my friend.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.549
I have no need for this human.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.927
Gluttony. Go.

18:16.011 --> 18:17.262
I don't think so.

18:29.024 --> 18:30.818
My alchemy doesn't work here?

18:30.901 --> 18:33.112
Settle down.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.911
What's up with that bearded guy?

18:40.994 --> 18:43.455
You are a spirited group.

18:44.498 --> 18:46.625
Oh. That's right.

18:47.835 --> 18:53.173
I suppose I shouldn't waste you.
Perhaps you'd be a good human to use.

19:07.187 --> 19:09.439
You're going to do that.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.359
What do you mean?

19:12.442 --> 19:15.612
If you pour
Philosopher's Stones into the blood,

19:15.696 --> 19:18.115
you can make Homunculi from humans.

19:19.158 --> 19:22.786
Most lose to the stone's power
and die, though.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.454
Philosopher's Stone.

19:26.373 --> 19:31.253
Currently, Greed's spot is open.

19:32.713 --> 19:36.592
So perhaps your body will work for him.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.386
Turn him into a Homunculus?

19:42.306 --> 19:45.267
Stop right there! Bastard!

19:45.976 --> 19:47.895
There are people waiting for him
to come home.

19:47.978 --> 19:48.937
Shut it, now!

19:51.940 --> 19:54.860
I came here to get my hands
on the Philosopher's Stone.

19:56.028 --> 19:59.489
And now he's going to put one
inside of me.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.742
That's exactly what I wanted.

20:02.409 --> 20:06.955
Now, now, my Greed is what you desire?

20:07.873 --> 20:09.708
How interesting.

20:20.844 --> 20:23.347
Give me your body.

20:23.430 --> 20:27.184
I, Greed, will use it for myself.

20:28.435 --> 20:32.022
All right, fine. You, the greedy one,

20:32.105 --> 20:34.942
I'll give you my body!

20:36.068 --> 20:39.738
You've got spirit, kid.
I hope you don't regret this.

20:39.821 --> 20:41.990
I'm not leaving empty-handed.

20:42.074 --> 20:47.913
I couldn't bear to face my loyal retainer
who was willing to cut off her arm.

20:48.914 --> 20:52.584
Is that so? I like your greed.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.337
Come on, Greed.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.589
I'll take you in!

21:07.808 --> 21:09.518
Ling.

21:22.656 --> 21:25.242
This body is nice.

21:26.451 --> 21:29.830
Thanks for birthing me, Father.

21:34.042 --> 21:34.876
Where's Ling?

21:38.797 --> 21:40.757
He was an interesting kid.

21:41.842 --> 21:46.888
But sorry, this body here
belongs to Greed now.

21:49.057 --> 21:52.102
There's no way he'd let you
take over that easily.

21:54.938 --> 21:58.191
Ling Yao! Answer me, Ling!

22:07.576 --> 22:09.161
Oh, the guards.

22:15.584 --> 22:18.754
How dare you hurt Lord Alphonse.
Let's go now!

22:20.255 --> 22:21.757
You can't use your arts here.

22:30.724 --> 22:35.354
How are you able
to use your alchemy in here?

22:40.192 --> 22:41.193
Hmm.

22:42.402 --> 22:45.322
Yes, I can see how this works now.

22:45.405 --> 22:48.075
A body disrupting attack.

22:49.201 --> 22:52.913
No, you're disassembling.

22:57.417 --> 22:59.461
One second more and I would've been dead.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.213
Mr. Scar!

23:02.839 --> 23:04.007
May!

23:05.967 --> 23:07.886
I think we have to retreat.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.940
That was so reckless!

23:25.779 --> 23:29.866
A dust explosion. They've done it now.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.286
Greed's gone too.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.330
Good grief.

23:36.248 --> 23:41.002
Even reborn, I couldn't fix
his rebellious nature.

23:46.675 --> 23:49.636
I'm not like
the other Homunculi.

23:52.305 --> 23:55.016
You see, I was a human.

23:57.310 --> 24:01.440
A Homunculus can be created

24:02.065 --> 24:05.235
by pouring the Philosopher's Stone
into your blood.

24:07.195 --> 24:11.324
And because of this, Wrath…

24:12.284 --> 24:16.246
courses through the blood in my veins.

24:20.500 --> 24:25.130
If you used to be human, isn't there a way
for you to be human again?

24:28.133 --> 24:29.551
Don't misunderstand.

24:32.762 --> 24:37.476
Homunculi have superhuman abilities
and pride.

24:39.436 --> 24:43.648
Then let me ask you this,
why are you allowing me to live?

24:48.028 --> 24:53.158
Because you still may prove
to be useful to us.

24:59.706 --> 25:00.707
I'm glad you're safe.

25:02.375 --> 25:06.296
It was an enormous mistake to think
the leadership here was corrupted.

25:07.422 --> 25:10.467
-So then Führer Bradley isn't…
-No.

25:11.760 --> 25:17.724
Everybody is.
The entire group of leaders are corrupt.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.438
Where the heck have you been?

25:23.522 --> 25:25.357
Mmm-mm.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.984
I called the military
and they didn't know where you were.

25:28.068 --> 25:31.738
I leave a message with Mustang
and you finally call me back.

25:32.489 --> 25:36.284
What? I don't care if he's a damn colonel!

25:38.787 --> 25:42.123
She's still so scary.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.458
What did Teacher say?

25:44.251 --> 25:46.253
She said we need to go and see Hohenheim.

25:46.336 --> 25:48.088
See Dad?

25:49.881 --> 25:52.217
He's probably in Reole right now.

25:52.300 --> 25:55.720
So we should go ask him
about the Promised Day.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.180
The Promised Day?

25:59.266 --> 26:04.729
The Promised Day. It's the same one
that bearded guy mentioned to us.

26:15.991 --> 26:19.578
Looks like it's almost finished.

26:20.996 --> 26:25.458
They've really dug this impressive tunnel.

26:39.472 --> 26:41.391
I'm sorry, everybody.

26:43.059 --> 26:44.728
Please, let me use you.

27:11.212 --> 27:13.173
Is that your secret weapon to defeat him?

27:15.550 --> 27:18.637
This is all the research
my brother left to me.

27:19.638 --> 27:20.805
What's it about?

27:22.390 --> 27:27.103
It's a fusion between Xing's arts
and the Amestris's alchemy.

27:34.611 --> 27:37.238
Okay, so what's it say?

27:37.739 --> 27:43.203
It's well put together, but there isn't
anything new I can see in it.

27:43.286 --> 27:45.705
What is this "Promised Day" then?

27:51.378 --> 27:52.337
Ling!

27:55.382 --> 27:58.677
Well, well, still got that appetite.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.763
Oh! I'm alive.

28:02.931 --> 28:05.767
I'm glad to see you.
Happy that you're Ling.

28:05.850 --> 28:08.436
No. I'm still a Homunculus.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.729
But you…

28:10.355 --> 28:14.901
This Greed, who took over my body,
is quite rebellious.

28:14.984 --> 28:18.363
Before he disobeyed his father
and was killed for it.

28:19.614 --> 28:21.116
So you're still Greed right now?

28:23.076 --> 28:26.996
I'm not exactly him. We're scrambled.

28:28.081 --> 28:32.919
I managed to take control for now,
but I don't know when he'll take it back.

28:33.002 --> 28:34.129
Really?

28:36.715 --> 28:39.884
But there's something
I have to tell you quickly.

28:40.677 --> 28:42.804
I've got tons of questions to ask you too.

28:44.264 --> 28:45.098
Ling?

28:48.476 --> 28:49.686
Ling!

28:49.769 --> 28:52.397
Hold on. Keep fighting!

28:55.024 --> 28:59.154
The Promised Day,
he's going to open the door.

28:59.237 --> 29:04.159
The Portal of Truth? Is that
what you mean? What's he planning to do?

29:04.909 --> 29:09.998
Ed, you have to stop him.

29:14.919 --> 29:16.087
Hey, Ling!

29:26.431 --> 29:32.645
Curses. That stupid Xing prince
blabbing all these secrets.

29:34.481 --> 29:35.523
Greed?

29:36.858 --> 29:38.443
Yeah.

29:41.863 --> 29:45.617
Whoa, I don't wanna fight you guys.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.244
Just as Ling told you.

29:48.870 --> 29:53.625
By now I've cut ties with the Homunculi.
They're on their own.

29:53.708 --> 29:55.960
Then tell us what you know, yeah?

29:56.753 --> 29:58.797
All about the Promised Day, Greed.

30:00.507 --> 30:05.720
Well, I can't do that either.
I'm not going to be on anybody's side.

30:07.597 --> 30:09.974
Find the answer yourselves.

30:11.142 --> 30:12.310
See ya.

30:15.939 --> 30:18.650
It's okay if we let him go?

30:20.068 --> 30:21.694
Yeah, he's still half Ling.

30:22.779 --> 30:25.365
He won't let Greed
take him over that easily.

30:25.907 --> 30:29.869
Oh, no. The research got really mixed up.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.288
Maybe…

30:36.167 --> 30:37.293
Huh?

30:38.211 --> 30:43.299
Listen, I noticed this research mentions
gold and immortality so many times.

30:44.133 --> 30:44.968
So what?

30:45.593 --> 30:51.057
So what if we take all the pages apart
and align those words together?

30:52.976 --> 30:55.270
Sure, let me help.

31:05.488 --> 31:09.742
See, now these sketches look to me
like they could be connected.

31:25.967 --> 31:27.051
Hold on.

31:28.303 --> 31:31.347
This is a Transmutation Circle
for the Philosopher's Stone.

31:33.141 --> 31:34.767
Reole.

31:35.393 --> 31:38.855
Hold on. These represent locations?

31:40.106 --> 31:41.608
Cameron.

31:43.401 --> 31:44.485
Fisk.

31:46.779 --> 31:48.114
Pendleton.

31:49.949 --> 31:53.453
This is Amestris.

31:54.704 --> 31:55.663
Mm.

31:56.831 --> 31:58.291
A nationwide circle…

32:00.835 --> 32:04.505
If they transmute a Philosopher's Stone
with a circle as big as the country,

32:05.548 --> 32:07.300
just how many lives will be sacrificed?

32:07.383 --> 32:08.301
Brother!

32:09.052 --> 32:11.638
All the cities
that form the points in the circle

32:11.721 --> 32:14.599
are areas where coups
or civil wars occurred.

32:15.308 --> 32:19.187
Does that mean the military is involved
in making those crests of blood?

32:19.270 --> 32:22.857
This is why so many lost their lives
around the country.

32:26.861 --> 32:32.200
So the Ishvalan civil war
was a part of this plan?

32:38.539 --> 32:41.376
They intentionally caused the civil war…

32:43.795 --> 32:46.172
to kill so many innocent people.

32:47.465 --> 32:49.842
<i>Ishvalans were just a casualty.</i>

32:55.890 --> 32:57.642
They will pay for this.

32:59.686 --> 33:02.730
The military is involved
in all the crests of blood.

33:04.399 --> 33:07.068
I'm sure Lieutenant Colonel Hughes
realized this.

33:07.151 --> 33:08.945
That's why he was killed.

33:09.487 --> 33:10.530
Of course.

33:11.280 --> 33:14.742
The first civil war was around
the time the country was founded,

33:14.826 --> 33:18.997
so this plan has been going on
for over 300 years. Wait.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.749
There's still one more place up north

33:21.833 --> 33:24.127
where the crest of blood
hasn't been carved yet.

33:24.919 --> 33:25.962
Briggs.

33:26.462 --> 33:27.630
Al.

33:28.715 --> 33:31.592
Find Hohenheim
and ask him about the Promised Day.

33:32.885 --> 33:34.178
What about you?

33:36.222 --> 33:38.975
I'll go to Briggs to try and stop them.

33:40.518 --> 33:41.853
I'm headed north.

33:43.354 --> 33:46.274
Yes, Edward just left for Briggs
in the north.

33:46.357 --> 33:48.609
I gave him a letter of introduction.

33:50.069 --> 33:52.739
The defenders of our border with Drachma.

33:53.740 --> 33:56.409
<i>Known as the Northern Wall of Briggs.</i>

33:56.492 --> 33:59.495
Can he move Major General Armstrong?

34:00.204 --> 34:02.874
Meanwhile, Alphonse headed east.

34:02.957 --> 34:05.043
They said he went to meet his father.

34:06.002 --> 34:07.420
Say what?

34:08.588 --> 34:12.508
My only lead
is that he was heading to Reole.

34:14.260 --> 34:16.846
I wonder if I'll find him. Dad.

34:21.184 --> 34:23.853
They say mountain weather changes easily,

34:24.604 --> 34:26.022
but this is way too sudden.

34:26.856 --> 34:28.900
I've completely lost sight of the path.

34:30.485 --> 34:34.155
Teacher said she survived here
a whole month in the winter

34:34.238 --> 34:35.865
back when she was training.

34:37.158 --> 34:39.410
There's no way she did that!

34:40.745 --> 34:43.372
She even said she killed a bear.

34:44.165 --> 34:46.876
A huge bear almost seven feet tall.

34:53.216 --> 34:55.718
A bear!

35:02.642 --> 35:03.851
Hold on.

35:04.769 --> 35:07.480
You're in uniform.
So you're a Briggs soldier, am I right?

35:08.106 --> 35:10.983
Don't try to resist, you Drachma mole.

35:16.114 --> 35:21.410
Wait, I came here as a friend.
I'm the State Alchemist, Edward Elric.

35:24.038 --> 35:28.292
I came to Briggs to meet commanding
officer Major General Armstrong.

35:32.797 --> 35:36.134
I have a letter of introduction
from his brother, Major Armstrong.

35:36.217 --> 35:37.385
Brother?

35:38.302 --> 35:40.054
What is it, Buccaneer?

35:43.891 --> 35:47.770
Ma'am, I apologize for the commotion,
Major General Armstrong.

35:48.396 --> 35:49.605
Major General?

36:00.032 --> 36:03.077
So the Major has an older sister.

36:04.620 --> 36:06.247
They look nothing alike.

36:16.632 --> 36:18.509
This is Alex's.

36:18.593 --> 36:19.427
Whoa!

36:19.510 --> 36:22.054
I have no use
for a letter of introduction.

36:22.138 --> 36:24.348
I will judge a man myself.

36:24.974 --> 36:26.475
What the hell?

36:27.643 --> 36:30.188
Come in, Fullmetal Alchemist.

36:42.408 --> 36:44.368
There has to be something more.

36:46.370 --> 36:50.541
There is no way my brother's research
would only guess at what their plan was.

36:51.375 --> 36:55.338
We rearranged the pages
hundreds of times already.

36:55.421 --> 36:56.881
Any more would…

36:56.964 --> 36:57.882
No.

36:59.175 --> 37:04.597
Don't give up.
There has to be a flip side to this.

37:06.474 --> 37:07.683
Flip side?

37:08.476 --> 37:11.562
Mr. Scar. That's it. Come on.

37:11.646 --> 37:14.273
Help me turn over all of these pages.

37:28.120 --> 37:30.414
That's what we needed.

37:30.498 --> 37:34.377
With this, we actually might be able
to stop what they're doing.

37:34.460 --> 37:36.712
Your brother was truly amazing.

37:38.339 --> 37:42.009
This is a fusion
of both countries' knowledge

37:42.093 --> 37:45.346
that will nullify
the nationwide Transmutation Circle.

37:46.180 --> 37:49.892
And on this side, it's the flip circle.

38:07.285 --> 38:11.831
So this is the impregnable fortress
protected by the elite soldiers of Briggs.

38:14.542 --> 38:17.086
How is my brother, Alex?

38:18.045 --> 38:19.672
Ah, he's doing very well.

38:21.507 --> 38:22.341
Shame.

38:23.092 --> 38:24.343
Shame?

38:30.891 --> 38:32.101
What is it?

38:32.184 --> 38:34.312
We have an intruder underground!

38:41.861 --> 38:42.862
Huh?

38:42.945 --> 38:44.113
What the hell is that?

38:45.156 --> 38:47.199
What a pain.

38:49.535 --> 38:51.829
This is huge.

38:52.413 --> 38:55.374
Can I stop digging now?

38:56.292 --> 38:57.543
A Homunculus!

39:00.588 --> 39:01.756
Fire!

39:05.593 --> 39:07.553
The bullets do nothing.

39:28.949 --> 39:32.578
Stop the alarm!
Don't let Drachma hear this commotion.

39:42.922 --> 39:44.215
Take out the fuse.

39:44.298 --> 39:46.342
-Yes, ma'am.
-Move them in.

39:50.638 --> 39:51.639
Fire!

40:05.194 --> 40:06.904
Fire everything we've got.

40:11.534 --> 40:12.868
We're all out!

40:13.953 --> 40:15.371
Then charge!

40:23.504 --> 40:24.755
Come on!

40:28.843 --> 40:31.429
Go forward
and push it outside off the cliff.

40:59.123 --> 41:00.583
Cold.

41:01.876 --> 41:03.752
What a pain.

41:10.593 --> 41:13.053
It's a blended fuel used in the north.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.972
It vaporizes immediately,

41:15.055 --> 41:18.434
even in this cold,
freezing your body instantly.

41:21.312 --> 41:25.232
You can hibernate there until spring,
giant oaf.

41:33.199 --> 41:35.493
What on earth is this place?

41:37.286 --> 41:39.997
Has that monster been digging this hole?

41:42.666 --> 41:45.294
What is Lieutenant General Raven
doing here?

41:45.377 --> 41:48.797
He said it was an emergency.
He just arrived from Central.

41:48.881 --> 41:52.551
He's asked for me as well?
How does he even know I'm here?

41:59.016 --> 42:04.772
Good to see you again,
Major General Armstrong.

42:08.234 --> 42:10.819
Winry! Why are you here?

42:20.287 --> 42:23.040
You came
because the military asked you to?

42:26.252 --> 42:29.171
They said you would need
your automail fixed

42:29.255 --> 42:31.840
for winter at the northern stronghold.

42:32.466 --> 42:35.844
I'm sorry, I had no idea
things were this dangerous.

42:36.929 --> 42:38.389
It's clearly a warning.

42:40.599 --> 42:44.895
If I step out of line,
then they would do something to you.

42:45.521 --> 42:48.899
Basically, right now you're their hostage.

42:50.359 --> 42:52.319
I'm their hostage?

42:53.737 --> 42:56.240
No, I'm holding the two of you back.

42:57.491 --> 42:59.868
No, you're not. I swear.

43:01.412 --> 43:03.956
Without you, I couldn't do alchemy.

43:07.251 --> 43:12.339
All you guys want is to get back
the original bodies you both lost.

43:13.048 --> 43:16.510
And yet you have to take
all these detours.

43:20.639 --> 43:21.807
It's okay, Winry.

43:23.601 --> 43:24.602
Don't worry.

43:35.863 --> 43:38.949
So that big oaf was digging this hole?

43:42.202 --> 43:43.370
This is enough.

43:53.714 --> 43:57.051
Don't worry
about anyone overhearing us here.

43:59.303 --> 44:02.931
I was relieved
as Briggs' commanding officer.

44:04.016 --> 44:05.184
What?

44:05.267 --> 44:06.727
I was…

44:07.311 --> 44:10.064
told to return that monster
back to this hole.

44:10.689 --> 44:14.151
Apparently, it wasn't a threat,
but a secret military operation.

44:16.445 --> 44:20.199
However, I don't care who it is,

44:21.325 --> 44:23.452
I won't let anybody
do whatever they want here.

44:27.206 --> 44:28.457
Fullmetal Alchemist.

44:29.750 --> 44:33.420
Tell me everything you know.
Don't hold back.

44:34.672 --> 44:35.798
I mean it.

44:45.891 --> 44:52.064
The Philosopher's Stone, Homunculus,
King Bradley, Father,

44:52.147 --> 44:56.110
also the Promised Day.

44:57.027 --> 44:59.571
This is all a little hard
to believe, right?

45:00.656 --> 45:06.495
And you're saying you came to Briggs
to stop any unrest that could be building,

45:06.578 --> 45:08.580
to carve their crest of blood here?

45:10.749 --> 45:14.670
Then I ask you, what is this hole for?

45:15.379 --> 45:18.006
I can't say for certain about this hole,

45:18.090 --> 45:22.344
but for alchemy, you need
a Transmutation Circle to do it.

45:23.762 --> 45:25.222
Here's what I'm thinking.

45:25.305 --> 45:27.599
This hole right here
forms part of the circle

45:27.683 --> 45:29.727
that's part of all of Amestris.

45:35.649 --> 45:36.650
What is it?

45:36.734 --> 45:39.778
Drachma is here
and they've launched a surprise attack.

45:40.404 --> 45:41.238
What?

45:41.321 --> 45:43.782
Why would they attack now of all times?

45:43.866 --> 45:47.286
Raven. He did something.

45:47.369 --> 45:49.872
Dammit. They beat us to it.

45:49.955 --> 45:52.207
Drachma's army is great.

45:52.291 --> 45:55.419
A victory would cost both sides
heavy losses.

45:56.712 --> 45:58.964
And the crest of blood will be carved.

45:59.506 --> 46:01.675
There's no way to avoid it.

46:03.135 --> 46:03.969
Forgive me.

46:06.346 --> 46:08.265
Engage them right now.

46:08.348 --> 46:09.767
Yes, ma'am!

46:14.521 --> 46:17.149
Right, begin the attack!

46:17.232 --> 46:19.943
Listen, we hit them all at once!

46:20.736 --> 46:24.031
Now is the time to show them
that Briggs is the strongest of all.

46:24.114 --> 46:25.115
Yes, sir.

46:35.834 --> 46:38.837
Go with them.
The Briggs soldiers will be helping you.

46:38.921 --> 46:41.215
They'll get you back to Resembool
safe and sound.

46:43.008 --> 46:45.052
You don't have to worry about me.

46:49.431 --> 46:50.933
Hey, Winry.

46:55.145 --> 46:57.689
Take Pinako and Dan
and get out of the country.

46:58.690 --> 47:00.442
What do you mean, get out?

47:01.443 --> 47:04.029
I thought you were planning on stopping
whatever bad thing was happening.

47:04.112 --> 47:05.447
I am, I know.

47:06.406 --> 47:07.449
But just in case--

47:07.533 --> 47:11.078
But there is no "just in case"!
Ed, you have to stop this.

47:11.703 --> 47:13.455
Please, protect the country.

47:14.373 --> 47:19.294
And then you and Al
will get your bodies back and come home.

47:20.587 --> 47:23.257
I'll do anything to see that happen.

47:30.848 --> 47:32.140
Okay then.

47:33.308 --> 47:35.811
I'll put an end to this Promised Day,

47:35.894 --> 47:38.272
and I'll make sure
to come back to you then.

47:41.817 --> 47:44.069
An apple pie better be there for me,
though.

47:56.957 --> 48:00.168
What did
the Fullmetal Alchemist tell you?

48:00.252 --> 48:04.131
About the origin of this country,
the Homunculi.

48:04.756 --> 48:08.594
Also, about your true identity.

48:11.722 --> 48:16.518
So you know all this information
and you still answered my summon?

48:16.602 --> 48:21.440
Well, the thing is, I am very interested
in obtaining eternal life.

48:27.946 --> 48:31.450
Führer King, I want to…

48:32.576 --> 48:38.373
No. I want the seat occupied
by your last idiot, General Raven.

48:47.966 --> 48:49.426
Interesting.

48:50.761 --> 48:54.056
Very well. I shall give you his seat.

48:59.519 --> 49:00.979
In exchange,

49:03.690 --> 49:07.235
you have to give me your Briggs soldiers,
at once.

49:09.154 --> 49:10.864
They're all yours, sir.

49:11.740 --> 49:15.077
They are strong soldiers.
I trained them all well.

49:15.911 --> 49:19.081
And I assure you,
you will be pleased with them.

49:34.805 --> 49:39.184
Oh. This brings back memories.

49:40.852 --> 49:44.022
But I have to hurry up and find Dad.

49:46.316 --> 49:49.403
-Yo, boss, how's this?
-Hmm?

49:51.780 --> 49:54.908
Mr. Hohenheim, go on,
you can take a break.

49:54.992 --> 49:57.786
No. I mean, you took care of me.

49:57.869 --> 50:00.622
And gave me a place to stay.
This is the least I can do.

50:05.711 --> 50:06.795
Hey!

50:06.878 --> 50:08.088
Huh?

50:08.922 --> 50:11.258
That's the armor from my study.

50:11.341 --> 50:15.804
No, no, it's me.
Didn't Granny Pinako tell you?

50:25.147 --> 50:26.606
Alphonse? Son?

50:30.318 --> 50:33.905
I see. So you met him.

50:34.948 --> 50:36.616
He looked just like you.

50:40.203 --> 50:45.167
So your new plan is to stop
the Promised Day in any way that you can?

50:46.334 --> 50:47.252
Yeah.

50:47.753 --> 50:50.047
Okay. Okay.

50:53.467 --> 50:56.970
Then this could be our destiny.

51:01.016 --> 51:05.103
Alphonse, I suppose…

51:07.230 --> 51:08.732
I need to tell you.

51:25.540 --> 51:28.543
Hey. Hello.

51:42.432 --> 51:43.767
Over here.

51:45.560 --> 51:48.355
Right here. Behind you!

51:59.658 --> 52:00.909
What…

52:02.744 --> 52:04.246
are you?

52:04.329 --> 52:07.666
You gave blood for an experiment.

52:08.375 --> 52:10.836
I was born from that blood.

52:11.419 --> 52:12.504
Hmm.

52:14.256 --> 52:16.883
I am known as Slave 23.

52:16.967 --> 52:19.761
Huh? You don't have a name?

52:21.096 --> 52:24.975
Then let me thank you by giving you one.

52:25.851 --> 52:27.144
Hmm.

52:28.061 --> 52:31.648
How about Van Hohenheim?

52:34.151 --> 52:38.822
Hmm. Van Hohenheim, huh?

52:39.447 --> 52:44.619
Yeah, yeah, it's spelled…
Wait, do you know how to read and write?

52:45.579 --> 52:49.082
I can work without knowing
how to do those things.

52:49.166 --> 52:53.461
Then you don't plan on trying
to get out of this situation?

52:53.545 --> 52:56.673
Freedom, rights. You don't…

52:57.549 --> 52:59.593
want any of that?

53:00.552 --> 53:04.431
I shall give you knowledge.

53:05.390 --> 53:10.896
And with that,
I'll help to free you from slavery,

53:10.979 --> 53:12.856
Hohenheim.

53:14.107 --> 53:17.903
What should I call you then?

53:20.363 --> 53:21.948
Hmm.

53:22.032 --> 53:26.661
You can call me Dwarf in the Flask.

53:26.745 --> 53:28.455
Mm.

53:32.083 --> 53:37.214
You've come a long way
from being a slave back in the day.

53:38.715 --> 53:41.635
Whoa, you grew a beard.

53:41.718 --> 53:46.765
You look quite impressive now, Hohenheim.

53:47.432 --> 53:48.683
Shh.

53:49.517 --> 53:51.895
Immortality?

53:53.647 --> 53:57.817
Why does everyone with power
always want that?

53:57.901 --> 53:59.277
The king is here.

53:59.361 --> 54:01.321
Oh, it's fine.

54:01.404 --> 54:03.990
Enough with the talk.

54:04.866 --> 54:10.580
Immortality, can you give it to me or not?

54:12.624 --> 54:14.334
Fine.

54:14.417 --> 54:18.463
Immortality, I'll tell you…

54:45.824 --> 54:47.492
Look at that.

54:48.576 --> 54:50.954
We'll have an immortal king.

54:51.454 --> 54:56.001
A time that will be remembered forever.

55:00.380 --> 55:03.466
Oh. This is it?

55:06.594 --> 55:08.388
What's happening?

55:15.812 --> 55:18.982
What's wrong? What did you do?

55:21.026 --> 55:22.235
What is happening?

55:22.819 --> 55:25.572
Right now, you and I, the two of us…

55:26.531 --> 55:32.329
are at the center of everything!

56:25.507 --> 56:27.092
Everybody is dead.

56:33.640 --> 56:35.141
What the hell has he done?

56:39.646 --> 56:40.688
Anyone…

56:42.524 --> 56:43.900
just answer.

56:45.944 --> 56:50.323
They can't.
They've all had their souls removed.

56:52.283 --> 56:54.869
My king! You're all right--

56:56.287 --> 56:58.331
I've created a vessel

56:58.415 --> 57:02.419
based on the information from your blood.

57:07.549 --> 57:08.591
My God.

57:10.510 --> 57:12.679
Are you the dwarf I kept in the flask?

57:13.972 --> 57:20.103
As a thank you to you
for giving me your blood,

57:20.186 --> 57:25.567
I gave you your name, knowledge,
and a body that won't die.

57:27.861 --> 57:33.450
And in exchange, I took the souls
of everyone in this kingdom.

57:35.577 --> 57:37.328
How could you?

57:38.079 --> 57:42.792
Well, I actually only took
about half of them.

57:46.337 --> 57:49.591
Thank you for all your help,

57:51.551 --> 57:54.929
Hohenheim.

57:56.431 --> 58:03.146
No!

58:12.197 --> 58:13.907
May, it's me.

58:16.743 --> 58:18.286
Is Lord Alphonse back?

58:20.371 --> 58:23.666
He hasn't come back yet? Where's Scar?

58:23.750 --> 58:27.253
We figured out the true meaning
behind his brother's research.

58:27.837 --> 58:29.631
It's the flipped Transmutation Circle.

58:29.714 --> 58:32.592
Mr. Scar left to start preparations
to execute our plan.

58:32.675 --> 58:34.594
Flipped Transmutation Circle?

58:35.595 --> 58:36.513
Yo.

58:38.306 --> 58:39.265
Ling!

58:44.020 --> 58:45.730
It's Greed.

58:55.448 --> 58:58.618
You really still don't trust me, do you?

58:58.701 --> 59:01.371
Of course not. You're a Homunculus.

59:02.163 --> 59:05.792
Even though I'm here
to help you with recon?

59:06.668 --> 59:08.753
Give Ling back his body.

59:09.921 --> 59:11.422
I can't do that.

59:12.090 --> 59:15.260
I rather like this body quite a bit.

59:16.094 --> 59:18.596
I'm going to drive you out
one of these days, you know.

59:25.186 --> 59:26.312
Alphonse.

59:30.358 --> 59:31.901
You're finally here.

59:34.529 --> 59:35.697
What's wrong?

59:36.906 --> 59:37.907
You all right?

59:39.450 --> 59:41.286
Ed! Get away from him!

59:41.369 --> 59:42.203
Huh?

59:45.164 --> 59:46.457
That was close!

59:47.458 --> 59:50.461
Greed, so you joined their side?

59:50.545 --> 59:53.047
Your soul is too weak.

59:54.424 --> 59:55.675
You know this one?

59:56.884 --> 59:59.178
Yeah, this is Pride.

59:59.262 --> 1:00:04.976
He's my oldest brother.
Even I think he's a monster.

1:00:12.775 --> 1:00:14.694
Man, you're back again?

1:00:22.410 --> 1:00:23.953
It's good to see you again.

1:00:25.204 --> 1:00:27.582
I've been waiting for you, Lan Fan.

1:00:31.002 --> 1:00:35.923
Ed, leave this to Lan Fan.
We have to find Pride's vessel.

1:00:36.007 --> 1:00:37.258
Vessel?

1:00:38.092 --> 1:00:41.638
His real form is hiding
in the shadows in this forest.

1:00:55.068 --> 1:00:57.362
You really had me fooled, Selim.

1:00:58.404 --> 1:01:01.616
To think a brat like you was a Homunculus.

1:01:07.121 --> 1:01:09.499
Appearances are very deceiving.

1:01:10.500 --> 1:01:12.835
Don't you agree?

1:01:12.919 --> 1:01:14.253
Little alchemist.

1:01:19.217 --> 1:01:20.051
Fu!

1:01:22.470 --> 1:01:27.975
Cut off his shadow. It will disappear
if it's not attached to his real body.

1:01:29.227 --> 1:01:33.272
Running your mouth.
What a bad little brother you are.

1:01:34.399 --> 1:01:37.985
Wait. I sense him nearby.

1:01:39.654 --> 1:01:40.947
Hohenheim.

1:01:46.786 --> 1:01:51.666
You know, I don't appreciate the trouble
you've brought to both of my sons, Pride.

1:01:53.751 --> 1:01:55.336
You finally showed up.

1:01:56.921 --> 1:01:59.799
The hero should always turn up late.

1:02:00.425 --> 1:02:03.928
You're the hero?
Are you planning to beat me then?

1:02:05.930 --> 1:02:09.058
No, I won't do that.

1:02:09.600 --> 1:02:11.394
You are a frightening one.

1:02:20.570 --> 1:02:22.989
Distract me and attack me from behind?

1:02:24.157 --> 1:02:26.159
This plan you came up with is boring.

1:02:28.745 --> 1:02:33.499
You showed up just to become my hostage.
This son of yours is a super weird one.

1:02:35.126 --> 1:02:37.795
Don't insult my son like that.

1:02:52.143 --> 1:02:53.519
Al, no!

1:03:02.361 --> 1:03:04.655
It's complete darkness.

1:03:05.281 --> 1:03:07.867
Now you can't use your shadow power.

1:03:08.409 --> 1:03:10.536
But you're stuck in this place too.

1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:12.914
It's a test of wills.

1:03:13.539 --> 1:03:14.540
Maybe…

1:03:15.750 --> 1:03:18.753
we'll stay here
until after the Promised Day passes.

1:03:27.887 --> 1:03:28.888
No.

1:03:29.889 --> 1:03:32.517
You-- Hey!
You dropped Al in there too, idiot.

1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:34.769
This was all Alphonse's idea.

1:03:38.856 --> 1:03:43.277
He spent a long time thinking
about how we could all survive this.

1:03:49.784 --> 1:03:50.743
Al.

1:03:59.293 --> 1:04:01.170
Everything's ready on my end.

1:04:03.381 --> 1:04:05.049
The flipped Circle, right?

1:04:07.718 --> 1:04:12.139
There are several routes that head
to the underground at the center.

1:04:12.223 --> 1:04:14.058
We should split up.

1:04:16.102 --> 1:04:21.190
Now, while Alphonse has the most
dangerous of his minions occupied,

1:04:21.274 --> 1:04:23.526
we gotta take down the boss.

1:04:23.609 --> 1:04:26.737
Who put you
in charge here?

1:04:30.366 --> 1:04:31.534
Al!

1:04:32.827 --> 1:04:37.123
We're heading out. To knock out
that underground bearded guy.

1:04:43.337 --> 1:04:44.463
Ah.

1:04:45.089 --> 1:04:47.967
There will be an eclipse today.

1:04:59.770 --> 1:05:01.230
Where are the Briggs soldiers?

1:05:01.856 --> 1:05:05.443
Sir, they have not arrived
due to the train accident yesterday.

1:05:07.111 --> 1:05:09.030
Mustang is planning a coup.

1:05:12.116 --> 1:05:13.534
You're sure of it?

1:05:17.663 --> 1:05:19.290
I'm heading back to Central.

1:05:40.186 --> 1:05:41.687
You're quite late, Colonel.

1:05:41.771 --> 1:05:43.856
We almost left you behind.

1:05:45.191 --> 1:05:46.609
You weren't followed?

1:05:47.360 --> 1:05:50.655
He would've reacted
if someone were here.

1:05:50.738 --> 1:05:52.239
He's so useful.

1:05:52.323 --> 1:05:55.201
Honestly, I almost think
he deserves a rank.

1:05:56.494 --> 1:06:00.623
Forget Mustang. He's a traitor.

1:06:15.972 --> 1:06:19.976
Success. All right!
The Führer was caught in the blast.

1:06:20.601 --> 1:06:22.395
Colonel, your orders?

1:06:24.063 --> 1:06:27.483
Right now, all we have
is a one-way ticket to a battlefield.

1:06:27.566 --> 1:06:30.820
Which means
I only have one order for you all.

1:06:32.363 --> 1:06:34.615
Don't die. That is all.

1:06:35.741 --> 1:06:36.701
Sir!

1:07:00.474 --> 1:07:03.060
What's happening? Mustang, you say?

1:07:04.020 --> 1:07:05.896
A coup d'état?

1:07:05.980 --> 1:07:10.234
Blast! We don't even know
if the Führer is alive!

1:07:11.861 --> 1:07:14.989
The Briggs soldiers are heading
to Central Headquarters.

1:07:15.072 --> 1:07:18.743
I thought the Briggs soldiers were
supposed to be running drills in the east?

1:07:20.453 --> 1:07:22.329
What's going on, Armstrong?

1:07:23.622 --> 1:07:26.959
What? I don't know.
They're not my men anymore.

1:07:28.961 --> 1:07:30.379
You.

1:07:32.131 --> 1:07:34.300
You know something, right?

1:07:34.383 --> 1:07:37.762
Soon we will be a part of the new world.

1:07:37.845 --> 1:07:40.389
Everyone here will become immoratal.

1:07:41.098 --> 1:07:43.642
And you choose to go against…

1:07:45.478 --> 1:07:46.520
the chosen ones?

1:07:48.147 --> 1:07:50.691
This is the end of all of you.

1:07:55.780 --> 1:07:57.907
Are you a traitor, Armstrong?

1:07:58.741 --> 1:08:00.284
Not a traitor.

1:08:00.367 --> 1:08:04.163
When all this is said and done,
I'll be known as a hero.

1:08:13.047 --> 1:08:14.924
You're back again?

1:08:16.217 --> 1:08:18.344
Come at me, big oaf!

1:08:26.227 --> 1:08:30.147
Major General Armstrong is taking control
of the headquarters.

1:08:30.231 --> 1:08:34.151
We will be crushing the Central Army
once and for all!

1:09:09.895 --> 1:09:12.314
Hey, Sister, are you hurt?

1:09:12.898 --> 1:09:15.401
Who do you think you're talking to, Alex?

1:09:16.235 --> 1:09:19.238
What a pain.

1:09:20.614 --> 1:09:26.078
Putting in a serious effort is a pain.

1:09:35.045 --> 1:09:37.339
He's incredibly fast.

1:09:40.509 --> 1:09:44.680
I'm the fastest Homunculus.

1:10:06.493 --> 1:10:09.663
You're just
a regular child now.

1:10:24.053 --> 1:10:26.513
Wait. Are you doing some sort of signal?

1:10:29.767 --> 1:10:32.811
Pride, hello. There you are.

1:10:35.898 --> 1:10:37.524
You kept me waiting.

1:10:40.277 --> 1:10:44.949
I'm so tired from waiting.
I need to replenish my energy.

1:10:45.824 --> 1:10:46.742
Hmm?

1:10:51.872 --> 1:10:56.752
No, wait up, Pride. I don't want…

1:11:02.883 --> 1:11:04.718
What is this place?

1:11:09.890 --> 1:11:12.643
There's a Transmutation Circle
for a Philosopher's Stone.

1:11:36.959 --> 1:11:39.461
What are these people?

1:11:39.545 --> 1:11:41.588
Man, you guys again?

1:11:51.265 --> 1:11:52.766
They're never-ending.

1:11:59.606 --> 1:12:02.234
Do you need some assistance, Edward?

1:12:04.069 --> 1:12:07.281
Way to turn up in time
to steal all the glory, huh?

1:12:09.199 --> 1:12:10.617
Their heads are the weak point.

1:12:18.459 --> 1:12:20.336
This okay, Scar?

1:12:20.419 --> 1:12:24.006
The Colonel is one of the State Alchemists
they used in Ishval.

1:12:24.089 --> 1:12:27.760
The hell? You're still around?

1:12:27.843 --> 1:12:29.595
Yeah, I am.

1:12:31.305 --> 1:12:35.601
I don't know if you know this,
but I'm the one who killed Hughes.

1:12:37.895 --> 1:12:40.064
I really love, love that.

1:12:40.147 --> 1:12:45.194
Look right there. It's no fun
unless we hate each other like humans do.

1:12:51.950 --> 1:12:54.578
You don't need to say another word, Envy.

1:12:58.165 --> 1:13:03.504
I'll burn that tongue out of your mouth
and you'll never speak again.

1:13:14.264 --> 1:13:16.058
Your eyes will be next!

1:13:25.567 --> 1:13:30.697
I'll make you suffer this pain
over and over until you die.

1:13:30.781 --> 1:13:34.535
You stupid human. Don't look down on me.

1:13:49.716 --> 1:13:51.677
So this is your true form.

1:13:52.845 --> 1:13:54.805
Ridiculous.

1:13:54.888 --> 1:13:58.809
No. Stop it. Help me!

1:14:00.519 --> 1:14:03.147
I'll take my time roasting you.

1:14:11.655 --> 1:14:14.032
What is this, Lieutenant?

1:14:14.783 --> 1:14:18.579
That's enough, Colonel.
I'll take care of it from here.

1:14:19.496 --> 1:14:21.039
I'm just one snap away.

1:14:22.082 --> 1:14:23.917
-Put your gun down.
-I cannot comply.

1:14:24.001 --> 1:14:25.919
Stop screwing around! I said put it down!

1:14:28.714 --> 1:14:30.048
Fullmetal.

1:14:31.467 --> 1:14:32.676
Hand that thing over.

1:14:32.759 --> 1:14:33.969
I can't do that.

1:14:34.052 --> 1:14:36.472
Give it to me, Fullmetal. Now!

1:14:36.555 --> 1:14:38.807
Or I'll burn your left arm off right now!

1:14:39.475 --> 1:14:43.228
Just try it. Go ahead!
I'll throw down with you now.

1:14:44.229 --> 1:14:47.649
Mustang, take a look
at the way you're acting right now.

1:14:49.109 --> 1:14:52.362
You plan on standing
at the top of this country like that?

1:14:53.363 --> 1:14:55.782
You know this is not at all
what you were striving for.

1:14:58.535 --> 1:15:03.040
I don't believe I have the right to stop
someone else's vengeance.

1:15:03.665 --> 1:15:05.542
But it would be quite a sight to see,

1:15:06.460 --> 1:15:10.506
the world that you create,
after you've strayed from the path.

1:15:11.048 --> 1:15:12.633
That makes you human.

1:15:12.716 --> 1:15:14.259
I won't let you kill it!

1:15:14.343 --> 1:15:16.470
This thing is what murdered Hughes!

1:15:16.553 --> 1:15:17.554
Right now, you're not…

1:15:18.931 --> 1:15:22.226
acting on behalf of the country
or for your friends, Mustang.

1:15:23.894 --> 1:15:28.941
You're doing it
to satisfy the rage that's burning inside.

1:15:32.903 --> 1:15:35.697
You promised
you wouldn't give in to that side.

1:15:53.340 --> 1:15:57.469
What's going on? Subordinates scolding me.

1:16:01.640 --> 1:16:03.392
Talked down to

1:16:04.434 --> 1:16:08.105
by a man who once wanted to kill me?

1:16:09.147 --> 1:16:13.277
I am a giant fool.

1:16:16.530 --> 1:16:17.489
Forcing…

1:16:19.408 --> 1:16:20.993
all of you to act this way.

1:16:30.002 --> 1:16:33.338
Please, lower your gun, Lieutenant.

1:16:40.429 --> 1:16:41.763
I'm so sorry.

1:16:58.614 --> 1:17:03.118
Hypocrites. You're all so dumb.

1:17:07.372 --> 1:17:10.584
Why? Why?

1:17:10.667 --> 1:17:13.295
Because you're jealous of humans, Envy.

1:17:14.296 --> 1:17:19.301
No matter how hurt, discouraged,
or misguided we become,

1:17:19.926 --> 1:17:21.428
we take on challenges.

1:17:23.263 --> 1:17:25.015
The people around us help us.

1:17:27.142 --> 1:17:30.646
And so you're jealous of us humans.

1:17:31.229 --> 1:17:32.606
Ow!

1:17:34.608 --> 1:17:39.738
You inferior life forms.
Stupid humans, figuring me out.

1:17:41.114 --> 1:17:43.158
This is the ultimate insult!

1:17:55.504 --> 1:17:56.755
Suicide.

1:17:59.800 --> 1:18:01.468
What a coward.

1:18:35.210 --> 1:18:36.795
You came alone?

1:18:38.380 --> 1:18:41.216
Slave 23.

1:18:43.552 --> 1:18:46.763
Well, now, have you become such a bore.

1:18:47.931 --> 1:18:52.394
You used to be more interesting
and way more emotive.

1:18:53.270 --> 1:18:57.607
Right, Dwarf in the Flask?

1:18:59.651 --> 1:19:03.280
Lust, greed, sloth,

1:19:03.780 --> 1:19:07.951
gluttony, envy, wrath, pride.

1:19:09.286 --> 1:19:12.831
You cut out these emotions
and released them as Homunculi,

1:19:12.914 --> 1:19:15.208
furthering yourself
from humanity even more.

1:19:16.460 --> 1:19:20.005
Becoming human was never my goal.

1:19:21.715 --> 1:19:25.302
I want to become a perfect god.

1:19:38.732 --> 1:19:44.488
I'll take the 500,000 plus people's worth
of Philosopher's Stones inside you.

1:19:58.335 --> 1:20:01.046
You finally changed your expression.

1:20:01.129 --> 1:20:02.672
What did you do?

1:20:03.590 --> 1:20:07.385
The souls that you stole from me
and put inside of you

1:20:08.345 --> 1:20:10.263
are all on my side.

1:20:12.849 --> 1:20:17.103
Impossible. They were mere energy forms!

1:20:18.480 --> 1:20:20.440
You think it's not true?

1:20:21.691 --> 1:20:23.693
I just spoke with them,

1:20:23.777 --> 1:20:30.116
the souls of the 536,329 Xerxes citizens.

1:20:30.200 --> 1:20:31.618
All inside of me.

1:20:33.745 --> 1:20:35.747
We will work together

1:20:37.374 --> 1:20:39.751
to destroy that vessel of yours!

1:20:45.715 --> 1:20:49.761
You look down upon them,
but they'll teach you a lesson.

1:21:11.741 --> 1:21:15.662
Now you're the one
who's looking down upon me, aren't you?

1:21:15.745 --> 1:21:17.956
Hohenheim.

1:21:18.540 --> 1:21:22.586
Do not think
you are the only ones advancing.

1:21:27.507 --> 1:21:28.925
Where was it again?

1:21:32.637 --> 1:21:35.473
I have to find an entrance
to the underground.

1:21:37.350 --> 1:21:40.854
Listen to me, Sis. This is your chance.

1:21:45.066 --> 1:21:45.942
Oh!

1:21:50.280 --> 1:21:51.865
I came to help you guys.

1:21:59.331 --> 1:22:00.790
I'm dying?

1:22:02.834 --> 1:22:04.669
Oh well.

1:22:05.879 --> 1:22:11.051
Living is… a pain.

1:22:19.434 --> 1:22:22.354
Are you the woman, Izumi Curtis?

1:22:23.855 --> 1:22:25.774
Did Ed say something about me?

1:22:26.358 --> 1:22:29.611
Wait, you were the one who toyed
with my Briggs soldiers for a month.

1:22:34.282 --> 1:22:37.953
Sister, it's Captain Buccaneer.

1:22:40.705 --> 1:22:41.665
What is it?

1:22:41.748 --> 1:22:44.918
We took down 90% of Central Headquarters.

1:22:47.170 --> 1:22:49.255
Victory is ours!

1:22:49.339 --> 1:22:51.675
Well done, Buccaneer.

1:22:51.758 --> 1:22:53.301
Greetings, men.

1:22:54.052 --> 1:22:56.096
Oh, shit, he's still alive.

1:22:57.263 --> 1:22:59.099
King Bradley!

1:22:59.766 --> 1:23:01.059
Where is he?

1:23:02.352 --> 1:23:04.896
-Right at the front.
-What is this?

1:23:06.314 --> 1:23:08.817
Is there a reason that I have to use

1:23:09.776 --> 1:23:13.488
a back entrance to enter my own castle?

1:23:36.761 --> 1:23:40.765
Greed, I will not show mercy
if you interfere.

1:23:42.183 --> 1:23:44.644
What can I say? I'm greedy.

1:23:45.478 --> 1:23:47.731
And I wanna take your life.

1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:25.727
Not bad, old man.

1:24:28.021 --> 1:24:29.355
You're Greed now, was it?

1:24:30.732 --> 1:24:33.485
My prince's body is giving off
some strange energy.

1:24:41.117 --> 1:24:44.996
So this is the man who ripped
the arm off my precious granddaughter?

1:24:53.254 --> 1:24:54.547
Selim!

1:24:55.090 --> 1:24:58.426
The time has come
for you human sacrifices.

1:24:58.510 --> 1:25:01.596
It's finally time
to fulfil your roles for us.

1:25:14.859 --> 1:25:16.528
Fullmetal!

1:25:40.552 --> 1:25:41.886
Fu!

1:25:45.473 --> 1:25:47.267
Are you the Xing prince?

1:25:48.226 --> 1:25:49.894
Here you are again,

1:25:50.562 --> 1:25:54.315
putting yourself in danger
for those you don't need to take care of.

1:25:56.568 --> 1:26:00.029
You can't become king if you're that soft.

1:26:01.865 --> 1:26:06.077
My prince,
please let go of an old man like me.

1:26:07.245 --> 1:26:09.664
That's not the kind of king Xing deserves.

1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:15.461
This man is unworthy of being a king.

1:26:16.004 --> 1:26:20.216
You're right, he must be defeated here.

1:26:22.677 --> 1:26:24.470
Harden yourself, Greed.

1:26:27.765 --> 1:26:29.893
Protect my prince's body!

1:26:30.727 --> 1:26:32.103
Become our king.

1:26:32.979 --> 1:26:35.064
This old man right here

1:26:35.148 --> 1:26:38.902
will take his life. It's time to go!

1:26:38.985 --> 1:26:40.820
Please don't do it!

1:26:57.337 --> 1:27:00.006
You may have the eyes of a god,

1:27:00.715 --> 1:27:04.093
but you can't stop an attack
from a blind spot.

1:27:04.177 --> 1:27:08.389
Old man, I'll join you
when you go to hell.

1:27:09.015 --> 1:27:11.017
You have my thanks.

1:27:26.324 --> 1:27:27.825
Grandfather!

1:27:49.430 --> 1:27:50.765
You have to let go, now.

1:27:51.641 --> 1:27:55.520
My job is to protect you.
You're my prince.

1:27:55.603 --> 1:27:57.647
Idiot! Help your grandfather!

1:27:59.857 --> 1:28:03.069
No. It's too late.

1:28:40.565 --> 1:28:41.607
Teacher!

1:28:43.735 --> 1:28:45.403
What's happening here?

1:28:47.113 --> 1:28:47.989
Al!

1:28:50.158 --> 1:28:52.702
We're still one short.

1:28:57.498 --> 1:28:58.916
Hmm.

1:28:59.709 --> 1:29:01.294
Hohenheim?

1:29:01.377 --> 1:29:02.628
Dad?

1:29:04.505 --> 1:29:07.508
Sorry you have to see me like this, boys.

1:29:08.134 --> 1:29:10.303
What is this enormous black thing?

1:29:10.970 --> 1:29:14.182
It's the one
that the Homunculi call Father.

1:29:14.265 --> 1:29:16.100
Huh? The bearded guy?

1:29:17.310 --> 1:29:22.482
I welcome you, my human sacrifices.

1:29:33.534 --> 1:29:35.495
There's no time left.

1:29:36.120 --> 1:29:41.626
Colonel Mustang, do a human transmutation
and open the Portal of Truth?

1:29:43.378 --> 1:29:44.253
What?

1:29:45.296 --> 1:29:49.926
We're short one human sacrifice.
You can transmute anyone you like.

1:29:50.510 --> 1:29:55.014
Maybe a dead parent. A lover? A friend?

1:29:55.098 --> 1:29:56.516
I won't do it.

1:30:11.406 --> 1:30:12.490
Colonel!

1:30:16.077 --> 1:30:18.830
It doesn't matter
if you don't want to.

1:30:20.373 --> 1:30:23.960
I will force you to open that portal.

1:30:29.507 --> 1:30:33.469
I have him now.
Move out of the way, Wrath.

1:30:35.680 --> 1:30:40.059
All right. I can't wait
to see what they take from you.

1:30:44.939 --> 1:30:50.445
Now, let's start the human transmutation,
Colonel Mustang.

1:31:25.855 --> 1:31:26.731
Colonel!

1:31:32.737 --> 1:31:35.448
We have five now.

1:31:35.531 --> 1:31:36.699
A-ha!

1:31:37.909 --> 1:31:38.826
Are you okay?

1:31:38.910 --> 1:31:42.413
Fullmetal, where is this place?

1:31:42.497 --> 1:31:45.875
We're at the final boss. What happened?

1:31:47.001 --> 1:31:52.256
I was sent in front of a giant door
inside of a white space.

1:31:53.257 --> 1:31:54.967
You opened the portal?

1:31:56.177 --> 1:31:58.971
What did they take? Your arm? Your leg?

1:31:59.055 --> 1:32:02.016
What are you doing?
I can't see anything here.

1:32:03.226 --> 1:32:04.393
What are you saying?

1:32:09.065 --> 1:32:10.316
I've lost…

1:32:11.943 --> 1:32:13.277
my sight.

1:32:33.631 --> 1:32:36.884
The truth is very cruel, isn't it?

1:32:36.968 --> 1:32:40.763
Those who sought the warmth
of their late mother,

1:32:40.846 --> 1:32:43.891
one lost their arm and leg,

1:32:43.975 --> 1:32:49.564
while the other became something
that could no longer even feel anything.

1:32:50.189 --> 1:32:53.234
Another, who sought the child she lost,

1:32:53.317 --> 1:32:56.988
received a body
that could never have a child again.

1:32:57.071 --> 1:33:01.284
And the one who had his sights set
on the future of the country,

1:33:01.367 --> 1:33:04.287
had his eyesight taken away.

1:33:04.370 --> 1:33:11.085
It gives the appropriate punishment
to overconfident humans.

1:33:12.378 --> 1:33:18.342
That is truth, what you humans
have come to recognize as…

1:33:19.594 --> 1:33:21.220
your God.

1:33:25.474 --> 1:33:30.021
Mr. Scar, this is the middle.
It's below here.

1:33:30.730 --> 1:33:33.357
I sense the presence of numerous people.

1:33:42.575 --> 1:33:43.534
Lord Alphonse!

1:33:46.037 --> 1:33:46.912
Colonel!

1:33:52.460 --> 1:33:54.837
I will not let you interfere with him.

1:34:26.702 --> 1:34:28.412
Now I've blocked your right arm.

1:34:38.297 --> 1:34:41.509
You completely overlooked my new left arm.

1:34:46.681 --> 1:34:48.766
I just recently carved it.

1:34:49.600 --> 1:34:52.978
A Reconstruction Transmutation Circle
my brother gave to me.

1:35:07.326 --> 1:35:13.249
The time is here!

1:35:16.711 --> 1:35:18.629
Have you ever thought

1:35:19.255 --> 1:35:25.094
of the Earth as a single life form
that lives and breathes?

1:35:26.554 --> 1:35:32.309
It records all the information
of this universe.

1:35:32.393 --> 1:35:34.937
What kind of power could you have

1:35:35.688 --> 1:35:39.692
if you could open the doors
to the center of the Earth?

1:35:41.986 --> 1:35:47.158
I will use you, my human sacrifices,

1:35:48.325 --> 1:35:50.745
to open that door.

1:35:51.787 --> 1:35:52.663
Now!

1:35:54.999 --> 1:35:57.251
Oh, no! He got us!

1:36:30.409 --> 1:36:31.786
Winry!

1:36:34.330 --> 1:36:38.375
Hohenheim, I'm gonna

1:36:38.459 --> 1:36:40.169
kill you when you're here.

1:37:13.369 --> 1:37:15.204
God!

1:37:15.287 --> 1:37:19.792
Answer the call of my soul!

1:37:21.043 --> 1:37:23.712
Open!

1:37:32.304 --> 1:37:36.725
Yes, I will drag you down to Earth,

1:37:36.809 --> 1:37:41.522
and make you a part of me!

1:38:13.804 --> 1:38:14.930
Okay, what now?

1:38:17.808 --> 1:38:19.310
It's really quiet.

1:38:21.186 --> 1:38:22.229
My goodness.

1:38:23.731 --> 1:38:25.900
Has he turned us
into Philosopher's Stones now?

1:38:27.735 --> 1:38:29.069
That's right.

1:38:31.155 --> 1:38:33.699
All except those in the center.

1:38:35.367 --> 1:38:39.788
Dammit. You actually did it.

1:38:49.757 --> 1:38:51.884
Thank you for cooperating.

1:38:54.303 --> 1:38:56.013
Human sacrifices.

1:38:58.724 --> 1:39:00.309
Everyone, get close to me.

1:39:06.815 --> 1:39:07.775
Quick!

1:39:16.617 --> 1:39:18.410
Goodbye now.

1:39:32.800 --> 1:39:34.885
Everyone, stay close to me here.

1:39:37.054 --> 1:39:38.389
Oh.

1:39:40.015 --> 1:39:44.520
You're able to hold on
with just 500,000 Philosopher's Stones.

1:39:47.064 --> 1:39:50.025
You will not withstand the next attack.

1:39:59.618 --> 1:40:00.953
No way.

1:40:01.662 --> 1:40:04.623
I finally obtained God Almighty.

1:40:04.707 --> 1:40:08.961
I'm now able to create a mini sun
in the very palm of my hand.

1:40:11.213 --> 1:40:16.427
Alchemists, it's time to perish.

1:40:38.741 --> 1:40:40.784
You finally noticed.

1:40:41.368 --> 1:40:44.830
That heartbeat
that's pounding in your head.

1:40:46.373 --> 1:40:49.501
The souls of this country's people.

1:40:49.585 --> 1:40:53.714
They're connected to their bodies
through their spirits inside of you.

1:40:55.549 --> 1:41:00.137
What have you done, Hohenheim?

1:41:01.722 --> 1:41:04.475
After years and years of calculations,

1:41:05.392 --> 1:41:08.145
I have placed all my allies

1:41:09.688 --> 1:41:11.940
in the Philosopher's Stones.

1:41:12.775 --> 1:41:15.110
<i>The ones inside of me are all around.</i>

1:41:15.819 --> 1:41:19.782
<i>I placed them around the country.</i>

1:41:22.659 --> 1:41:25.204
And what would that do?

1:41:26.038 --> 1:41:30.167
You need a circle
to activate an alchemical reaction.

1:41:30.250 --> 1:41:33.045
I have a circle.

1:41:34.546 --> 1:41:40.094
Descending from the sky,
it is an incredibly powerful circle.

1:41:42.221 --> 1:41:46.141
The darkness,
the shadow the moon casts on the Earth,

1:41:46.225 --> 1:41:47.768
from the eclipse!

1:41:57.778 --> 1:42:01.532
You mean to stop this, Hohenheim? Huh?

1:42:01.615 --> 1:42:04.910
That's why I'm here right now.

1:42:04.993 --> 1:42:08.455
Your time is over now, Dwarf in the Flask!

1:42:41.029 --> 1:42:42.739
You okay?

1:42:48.662 --> 1:42:49.496
Winry,

1:42:50.289 --> 1:42:51.373
are you okay?

1:42:58.338 --> 1:42:59.548
Dad!

1:43:04.511 --> 1:43:09.266
All of the people's souls
were finally returned to their bodies.

1:43:12.060 --> 1:43:17.149
I won't let you repeat
what you did in Xerxes, ever again.

1:43:29.203 --> 1:43:31.872
He still has this much energy left in him?

1:43:37.169 --> 1:43:38.921
I can't hold it.

1:43:46.178 --> 1:43:47.638
Dad, don't give up.

1:43:49.014 --> 1:43:53.185
Don't you let up now. Just keep fighting!

1:43:53.268 --> 1:43:56.230
What? What am I to do?

1:43:57.397 --> 1:43:59.900
I really wanna make the both of you proud.

1:44:06.323 --> 1:44:08.617
How much longer, Scar?

1:44:44.361 --> 1:44:45.654
Oh.

1:44:47.906 --> 1:44:50.742
Heaven has sent the proper guest.

1:44:58.125 --> 1:44:59.751
You'll avenge your grandfather?

1:45:01.253 --> 1:45:03.130
I will allow this.

1:45:04.381 --> 1:45:06.383
Do you have any last words?

1:45:08.051 --> 1:45:09.011
No.

1:45:18.312 --> 1:45:23.442
My life was a set path that I followed.

1:45:26.695 --> 1:45:28.822
But thanks to you humans…

1:45:30.157 --> 1:45:31.074
Well…

1:45:32.659 --> 1:45:34.578
It was a challenging…

1:45:36.747 --> 1:45:38.623
and really good life…

1:45:41.293 --> 1:45:46.423
towards the end. Thank you.

1:46:24.544 --> 1:46:25.921
This is the center.

1:46:28.882 --> 1:46:30.092
Big brother.

1:46:56.785 --> 1:46:59.579
Now!

1:47:04.668 --> 1:47:07.254
You can't stop our alchemy anymore.

1:47:08.755 --> 1:47:10.257
Serves you right.

1:47:11.007 --> 1:47:13.343
This is the power of Scar's brother.

1:47:14.052 --> 1:47:16.388
The flipped Transmutation Circle!

1:47:16.471 --> 1:47:17.973
How's that, huh?

1:47:18.056 --> 1:47:20.976
It's taking all of your effort
just to contain that god inside of you.

1:47:21.059 --> 1:47:22.018
Step aside.

1:47:34.698 --> 1:47:37.784
He's planning on procuring
more Philosopher's Stones.

1:47:46.168 --> 1:47:47.294
Brother!

1:47:47.919 --> 1:47:49.004
Go on ahead.

1:47:49.629 --> 1:47:51.298
I'll do something about him.

1:47:51.923 --> 1:47:54.509
Let's go, Al. Let's stop him now.

1:47:54.593 --> 1:47:56.511
Don't you lose, Ed!

1:47:57.095 --> 1:47:57.929
Right.

1:48:05.353 --> 1:48:07.606
Become a part of me now.

1:48:14.821 --> 1:48:16.490
Okay then, don't mind if I do.

1:48:23.121 --> 1:48:25.248
You turned yourself
into a Philosopher's Stone

1:48:25.332 --> 1:48:27.834
to force your way inside of me?

1:48:30.587 --> 1:48:33.131
I've got you now, Pride.

1:48:33.757 --> 1:48:38.428
You're no longer allowed inside of here!

1:48:51.775 --> 1:48:53.818
So this is your true form then?

1:48:56.571 --> 1:48:58.031
Colonel! Colonel!

1:48:59.616 --> 1:49:00.992
Are you okay, sir?

1:49:01.785 --> 1:49:03.662
I've lost my sight.

1:49:05.914 --> 1:49:09.376
Are you still able to fight okay?

1:49:12.128 --> 1:49:13.004
Yes.

1:49:24.099 --> 1:49:27.769
Wait there for now, bad little Selim.

1:49:54.921 --> 1:49:56.756
Just stop resisting.

1:50:06.641 --> 1:50:10.103
Not yet. I'm not finished yet.

1:50:13.690 --> 1:50:15.942
There are endless resources.

1:50:21.573 --> 1:50:22.824
You bastard.

1:50:33.585 --> 1:50:34.919
Please, no.

1:51:13.458 --> 1:51:17.212
You saved me. You saved my life.

1:51:47.784 --> 1:51:51.579
He's getting close to his limit.

1:51:56.876 --> 1:52:01.339
Keep chipping away at his power.

1:52:11.349 --> 1:52:12.350
Did I hit him?

1:52:12.434 --> 1:52:14.561
You barely missed.
Five degrees to the right.

1:52:26.865 --> 1:52:28.950
Whittle it down!

1:53:02.066 --> 1:53:02.984
Run.

1:53:07.989 --> 1:53:09.574
Run now.

1:53:15.622 --> 1:53:18.875
May, I need a favor.

1:53:20.877 --> 1:53:24.547
Brother sacrificed his right arm
to put me in this suit.

1:53:24.631 --> 1:53:27.884
Which means
the opposite should be possible.

1:53:27.967 --> 1:53:29.469
The law of equivalent exchange.

1:53:31.179 --> 1:53:34.557
What do you mean?
Lord Alphonse, what are you saying?

1:53:35.350 --> 1:53:37.477
You only need to create the path for me.

1:53:38.937 --> 1:53:42.565
If I do that, Lord Alphonse will…

1:53:47.237 --> 1:53:51.282
The Philosopher's Stones.

1:53:51.866 --> 1:53:53.952
May, please.

1:54:02.418 --> 1:54:04.295
Run away!

1:54:06.714 --> 1:54:09.050
Edward! Run!

1:54:29.487 --> 1:54:30.864
What are you doing, Al?

1:54:32.657 --> 1:54:35.618
Win, Brother.

1:54:35.702 --> 1:54:36.786
No, Brother.

1:54:39.372 --> 1:54:40.915
No, Brother!

1:54:57.682 --> 1:55:01.102
You're really certain?

1:55:01.769 --> 1:55:05.648
Yeah. I know Brother will finish it.

1:55:26.711 --> 1:55:27.712
Yo.

1:55:28.421 --> 1:55:30.715
So you got your soul back.

1:55:34.802 --> 1:55:37.430
You think he'll come to take you back?

1:55:40.934 --> 1:55:44.187
He will. I know he will.

1:55:47.315 --> 1:55:52.028
I can't wait to see what he sacrifices.

1:56:19.847 --> 1:56:21.849
Bastard!

1:56:31.567 --> 1:56:32.443
It's working.

1:56:32.527 --> 1:56:33.528
Edward, do it.

1:56:33.611 --> 1:56:34.779
Edward, do it!

1:56:34.862 --> 1:56:35.947
Do it, Edward!

1:56:36.030 --> 1:56:37.198
Do it now!

1:56:39.492 --> 1:56:40.952
Edward, go!

1:56:41.035 --> 1:56:42.203
Now.

1:56:42.286 --> 1:56:43.579
Do it, Fullmetal.

1:57:05.143 --> 1:57:06.894
Get up, you loser.

1:57:07.854 --> 1:57:11.607
I'll show you how we are not even
remotely on the same level, you and I.

1:57:15.570 --> 1:57:16.988
What is this?

1:57:18.114 --> 1:57:24.037
How could I lose bare-handed?
You're a mere human and I have God.

1:57:26.706 --> 1:57:30.418
Oh, hey, pops,
I'm gonna take that god from you.

1:57:38.801 --> 1:57:41.137
Give me your stone.

1:57:43.639 --> 1:57:46.601
No!

1:57:46.684 --> 1:57:49.020
Don't give up, Greed!

1:57:52.315 --> 1:57:55.318
I wanted everything in this world.

1:57:55.401 --> 1:57:59.489
But what I really wanted
was to find friends like you guys.

1:57:59.572 --> 1:58:02.325
You're already our friend!

1:58:03.451 --> 1:58:07.789
Xing prince, become a good king.

1:58:10.124 --> 1:58:11.626
See ya.

1:58:12.210 --> 1:58:13.586
Greed!

1:58:23.554 --> 1:58:25.139
Lan Fan, do it!

1:58:31.104 --> 1:58:35.149
Greed,
why do you disobey your father?

1:58:35.233 --> 1:58:38.152
It's a late-stage rebellious phase
I'm going through.

1:58:38.236 --> 1:58:39.362
Greed!

1:58:39.445 --> 1:58:43.199
Bastard. Be gone, Greed.

1:58:44.242 --> 1:58:45.660
Do it now, Ed!

1:58:57.588 --> 1:58:59.465
Go back to where you came from,

1:59:00.341 --> 1:59:02.552
stupid little Dwarf in the Flask.

1:59:20.111 --> 1:59:23.030
No! I don't want to go back!

1:59:23.114 --> 1:59:26.951
I don't want
to be tied down there anymore.

1:59:28.744 --> 1:59:33.875
Stop it!

1:59:35.251 --> 1:59:40.798
Despair for the overconfident ones.
It's the end you desired.

1:59:51.934 --> 1:59:56.355
What's wrong? What happened? Did we win?

1:59:56.439 --> 1:59:57.356
Yes.

1:59:58.191 --> 2:00:02.111
Except, Alphonse isn't returning
from the other side.

2:00:04.739 --> 2:00:08.159
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2:00:09.744 --> 2:00:12.580
It's not your fault. It's what Al wanted.

2:00:24.717 --> 2:00:25.885
Edward.

2:00:30.348 --> 2:00:32.433
Use my life to bring…

2:00:33.768 --> 2:00:35.603
Alphonse back from there.

2:00:38.814 --> 2:00:43.444
I have… exactly one person left.

2:00:45.988 --> 2:00:49.533
What are you talking about?
There's no way in hell I could do that!

2:00:50.368 --> 2:00:51.410
Besides,

2:00:52.912 --> 2:00:56.165
Al and I decided we wouldn't
use someone's life to get our bodies back.

2:00:56.249 --> 2:00:57.375
Edward!

2:00:59.085 --> 2:01:00.878
The thing that happened

2:01:02.255 --> 2:01:03.798
with your bodies,

2:01:05.091 --> 2:01:07.843
that was all my fault.

2:01:12.431 --> 2:01:13.641
And I'm sorry.

2:01:26.112 --> 2:01:28.072
Let me at least…

2:01:30.449 --> 2:01:33.286
do something fatherly in the end.

2:01:37.581 --> 2:01:40.459
Stop being a dumbass, stupid Dad!

2:01:41.294 --> 2:01:44.547
Never say that again, okay? I'll hit you!

2:01:49.760 --> 2:01:51.262
Oh, wow.

2:01:52.638 --> 2:01:54.682
You finally called me your dad.

2:02:43.856 --> 2:02:45.608
We know this much is true, Al…

2:02:46.984 --> 2:02:48.819
Giving up is not in our blood.

2:03:20.851 --> 2:03:23.145
A human Transmutation Circle.

2:03:28.484 --> 2:03:30.069
I'll be there for a while.

2:03:35.741 --> 2:03:39.870
The Fullmetal Alchemist's
last transmutation.

2:04:00.933 --> 2:04:02.852
You came to take your brother back.

2:04:04.186 --> 2:04:05.688
But what will you pay?

2:04:06.772 --> 2:04:08.899
Will you offer your body?

2:04:24.415 --> 2:04:26.208
I've got it right here, behind you.

2:04:27.543 --> 2:04:29.837
It's a big one.

2:04:32.882 --> 2:04:36.594
The Portal of Truth
exists in all people.

2:04:38.179 --> 2:04:44.477
That means every person
has the power to use alchemy.

2:04:46.187 --> 2:04:51.233
You mean to revert to a regular human
who cannot use it?

2:04:54.653 --> 2:04:57.198
I was always a human to begin with.

2:05:00.951 --> 2:05:04.330
All is one, one is all.

2:05:07.041 --> 2:05:11.170
Even if I can't use alchemy,
I have great people in my life.

2:05:14.340 --> 2:05:16.258
My precious friends and family.

2:05:18.052 --> 2:05:21.889
That's the correct answer, Alchemist.

2:05:26.310 --> 2:05:29.480
You've beaten me, so take him.

2:05:31.023 --> 2:05:34.401
You can have all of him.

2:05:52.962 --> 2:05:55.297
That's some stunt you pulled.

2:05:58.509 --> 2:06:00.678
Brother, I came to get you.

2:06:02.680 --> 2:06:03.806
Hmm.

2:06:16.026 --> 2:06:17.361
Let's go home together.

2:06:20.030 --> 2:06:21.699
Everyone's waiting.

2:06:29.832 --> 2:06:32.459
Al! Al!

2:06:45.264 --> 2:06:47.433
Lord Alphonse!

2:06:48.642 --> 2:06:49.935
Oh, May.

2:06:51.520 --> 2:06:55.566
Sorry. I know I asked you
to do something painful.

2:06:57.443 --> 2:06:58.402
Yo.

2:07:03.032 --> 2:07:04.033
Dad.

2:07:14.543 --> 2:07:15.794
Welcome, son.

2:07:18.088 --> 2:07:19.048
I'm back.

2:07:29.933 --> 2:07:31.644
I can feel the heat.

2:07:46.784 --> 2:07:49.161
Al, I'm proud of you.

2:07:52.498 --> 2:07:54.166
Don't cry, Major.

2:07:56.251 --> 2:07:58.879
You're more handsome
than your big brother.

2:07:58.962 --> 2:08:00.589
Ling, you gotta be joking.

2:08:02.007 --> 2:08:04.176
Oh, stop crying, Major.

2:08:16.230 --> 2:08:19.483
Major General Armstrong
will be taking custody of you.

2:08:21.819 --> 2:08:23.987
I'm allowed to stay alive?

2:08:32.079 --> 2:08:35.249
Come back to Ishval with me
and help rebuild it.

2:08:45.634 --> 2:08:48.429
Ishvalan blood courses through me,
though only half.

2:08:49.930 --> 2:08:54.059
Both of us
can save the citizens of Ishval.

2:08:56.478 --> 2:08:59.982
Are you saying there is a purpose
to my second chance?

2:09:05.320 --> 2:09:06.280
Big Brother.

2:09:14.538 --> 2:09:17.124
The next emperor's throne
belongs to the Yao clan.

2:09:20.794 --> 2:09:22.463
But do not worry.

2:09:23.839 --> 2:09:27.050
The Yao clan promises
to protect your clan.

2:09:33.849 --> 2:09:37.978
The Chang clan and all the others
will be welcome.

2:09:41.565 --> 2:09:44.109
Now, let's go

2:09:45.360 --> 2:09:47.154
back to our country.

2:09:55.954 --> 2:09:57.289
This is where you hid.

2:10:00.501 --> 2:10:01.752
I no longer…

2:10:03.712 --> 2:10:08.509
am capable of seeing the future.
What do I do now?

2:10:12.930 --> 2:10:15.682
You promised to be a cornerstone.

2:10:15.766 --> 2:10:19.102
You were supposed to protect this country
with everyone, together.

2:10:24.274 --> 2:10:27.236
I'm sure we'll find a way
to get back your eyesight.

2:10:29.404 --> 2:10:33.617
Until then,
I will be your eyes for you, Colonel.

2:10:43.335 --> 2:10:45.420
Now, let's go.

2:10:50.551 --> 2:10:52.052
Come and feel the sun.

2:11:06.024 --> 2:11:07.234
Hohenheim?

2:11:19.121 --> 2:11:21.915
You old idiot.

2:11:25.210 --> 2:11:28.922
Why are you dying alone
with that blissful look on your face?

2:11:40.392 --> 2:11:41.476
Hi.

2:11:44.897 --> 2:11:47.107
Hi there. You made it, did you?

2:11:52.029 --> 2:11:53.405
Mission is done?

2:11:54.740 --> 2:11:55.616
Yeah.

2:11:58.035 --> 2:12:01.705
We fulfilled all of our duties as parents.

2:12:15.302 --> 2:12:21.183
The world will raise our children
to be strong now. They have what it takes.

2:12:55.008 --> 2:12:56.176
Winry, I'm back.

2:12:56.259 --> 2:12:58.303
Yep, I'm back.

2:13:16.822 --> 2:13:18.115
Welcome back.

2:13:40.262 --> 2:13:44.641
Make sure to oil it every day.
The screws need to be tight and--

2:13:45.392 --> 2:13:46.685
Are you listening?

2:13:46.768 --> 2:13:47.644
Yep.

2:13:48.645 --> 2:13:49.730
Oh.

2:13:53.775 --> 2:13:57.612
So you could've gotten
your leg back if you wanted, right?

2:13:58.989 --> 2:13:59.865
Yeah.

2:14:01.825 --> 2:14:03.827
But it was a good reminder, I think.

2:14:09.416 --> 2:14:12.002
I can't wait to see
what's out there in the west.

2:14:13.920 --> 2:14:15.088
Hmm?

2:14:16.089 --> 2:14:17.215
Mm-mm.

2:14:17.299 --> 2:14:20.969
It's you. No matter how old you get,
you can't sit still, can you?

2:14:22.220 --> 2:14:25.265
Listen, don't be reckless.

2:14:26.433 --> 2:14:28.226
You can't use alchemy anymore.

2:14:30.270 --> 2:14:31.772
You're right, I know.

2:14:41.782 --> 2:14:43.241
See you, then.

2:14:43.325 --> 2:14:44.409
Mm.

2:15:00.675 --> 2:15:01.885
Uh…

2:15:04.846 --> 2:15:06.932
Um, you know, uh…

2:15:07.015 --> 2:15:09.267
What's wrong? Ed, talk to me.

2:15:17.484 --> 2:15:19.152
Equivalent exchange!

2:15:19.820 --> 2:15:24.199
I'll give you half my life,
so please give me half of yours.

2:15:30.205 --> 2:15:31.873
Man, are you stupid?

2:15:31.957 --> 2:15:33.250
What's wrong?

2:15:33.333 --> 2:15:37.546
Why are alchemists always on
about the law of equivalent exchange?

2:15:38.547 --> 2:15:41.424
You are stupid.

2:15:42.759 --> 2:15:45.637
I won't give you half.
You can have it all.

2:15:59.734 --> 2:16:01.027
Enough!

2:16:01.111 --> 2:16:03.196
No, sorry, sorry.

2:16:03.947 --> 2:16:06.491
Yep, you really are awesome.

2:16:07.367 --> 2:16:11.538
You turned the law of equivalent exchange
right on its head, didn't you?

2:16:11.621 --> 2:16:12.914
Are you making fun of me?

2:16:19.337 --> 2:16:20.964
Wait for me, Winry.

2:16:26.136 --> 2:16:27.012
Mm.

2:16:45.197 --> 2:16:46.156
Yep.

2:16:59.753 --> 2:17:06.134
THE END
