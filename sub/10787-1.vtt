WEBVTT

00:07.000 --> 00:08.750
HEY!

00:08.750 --> 00:10.125
JUST CAUGHT US
SOME DINNER.

00:10.125 --> 00:11.834
AH, SEAFOOD.

00:11.834 --> 00:14.125
GREAT CHANGE OF PACE,
PACE.

00:14.125 --> 00:17.959
WAS THAT A NOTE OF DISGUST
I DETECTED AT OUR SUSTENANCE
OF THE OCEAN BORN?

00:17.959 --> 00:19.375
AFTER THIS TRIP, IF I
NEVER EAT ANOTHER THING

00:19.375 --> 00:23.625
THAT BREATHES THROUGH GILLS
AGAIN, IT'LL BE TOO SOON.

00:25.708 --> 00:27.458
SO THERE SHE BLOWS, HUH?

00:27.458 --> 00:30.542
CAPESIDE, MASS.
OUR FIRST AND LAST
PORT OF CALL.

00:30.542 --> 00:34.125
DOESN'T LOOK MUCH DIFFERENT
THAN WHEN WE LEFT IT,
DOES IT?

00:34.125 --> 00:36.125
THAT'S 'CAUSE
IT AIN'T, FRAULEIN.

00:38.417 --> 00:41.000
I'M IN NO MORE OF A RACE
THAN YOU ARE TO GET BACK THERE,

00:41.000 --> 00:43.417
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVE
ANOTHER CHOICE IN THE MATTER.

00:43.417 --> 00:45.542
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO HOME.

00:45.542 --> 00:47.708
WE SURVIVED FOR 3 MONTHS
TAKING ODD JOBS.

00:47.708 --> 00:49.125
WE CAN SURVIVE
FOR AS LONG AS WE WANT.

00:49.125 --> 00:51.375
AS LONG AS WE'RE HAPPY.

00:54.166 --> 00:58.000
PACEY, IF YOU'RE SO SERIOUS
ABOUT THIS, THEN WHY
BRING THIS UP NOW...

00:58.000 --> 00:58.875
2 HOURS FROM HOME?

00:58.875 --> 01:00.333
12 HOURS FROM HOME.

01:00.333 --> 01:04.708
SEE, I THINK
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
DROP ANCHOR HERE,

01:04.708 --> 01:06.417
HAVE A BITE TO EAT,
AND THEN WE CAN DEBATE

01:06.417 --> 01:08.792
WHETHER OR NOT TO SCRAP
THIS WHOLE MISSION HOME.

01:11.875 --> 01:15.458
NO. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU,
PACEY WITTER.

01:15.458 --> 01:17.834
I MEAN, AS TRUANT AS
YOUR NATURAL INSTINCTS
MAY BE,

01:17.834 --> 01:20.959
YOU'D NEVER REALLY
SUGGEST US SKIPPING OUR
SENIOR YEAR ENTIRELY.

01:20.959 --> 01:24.583
JUST WHAT WOULD WE BE MISSING
FROM THE LAND OF POORLY
SCRIPTED MELODRAMAS, HUH?

01:24.583 --> 01:26.667
RECYCLED PLOT LINES,
TIRESOME SELF-REALIZATIONS?

01:26.667 --> 01:30.250
YOU THROW IN
THE OCCASIONAL DOWNWARD
SPIRAL OF A DEAR FRIEND

01:30.250 --> 01:32.500
AND MAYBE A BABY HERE
AND A DEATH THERE,

01:32.500 --> 01:36.917
AND ALL YOU'VE REALLY GOT IS
A RECIPE FOR SOME SOUL-SUCKING,
MIND-NUMBING ENNUI.

01:36.917 --> 01:40.250
AND I, FOR ONE, CAN SKIP IT.

01:40.250 --> 01:42.917
YOU KNOW WHAT CONTINUALLY
AMAZES ME, PACE?

01:42.917 --> 01:45.291
AND WHAT IS THAT?

01:45.291 --> 01:48.583
HOW LONG YOU'VE LASTED
WITHOUT BEING THROWN
OFF THIS BOAT.

01:48.583 --> 01:50.250
OH, FINALLY.

01:50.250 --> 01:52.417
THAT'S SOMETHING
WE CAN BOTH AGREE UPON.

02:55.792 --> 02:58.208
I'D KICK OFF JACK.

02:58.208 --> 02:59.500
[LAUGHS]

02:59.500 --> 03:02.125
YOU'D KICK ME OFF THE ISLAND
BEFORE YOU'D KICK OFF ANDIE?

03:02.125 --> 03:03.166
ANDIE'S VERY RESOURCEFUL.

03:03.166 --> 03:05.083
ALL RIGHT. GIVE IT UP
FOR GIRL POWER.

03:05.083 --> 03:06.834
YEAH. RUTHLESS ALLIANCE.

03:06.834 --> 03:08.250
OH, COME ON, JACK.

03:08.250 --> 03:10.166
IT'S NOT LIKE WE
KICKED YOU OFF FIRST
OR ANYTHING.

03:10.166 --> 03:11.708
I MEAN, WE ALREADY
KICKED OFF GRAMS.

03:11.708 --> 03:13.000
YEAH.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.583
WELL, THAT COMPARISON
JUST BATHES ME IN RELIEF.

03:15.583 --> 03:17.333
YOU GUYS SHOULD GO IN.
THE WATER'S WARM.

03:17.333 --> 03:21.125
YEAH, RIGHT. AND REAPPLY
THE 20 MINUTES OF LOTION
I JUST PUT ON.

03:21.125 --> 03:22.667
NO, THANKS.

03:22.667 --> 03:23.667
WE GOTTA GO.

03:23.667 --> 03:25.875
WE GOTTA PAINT
MRS. HAMMACOTT AT 2:00.

03:25.875 --> 03:28.667
MM, SOUNDS KINKY.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.041
HE MEANS HER HOUSE.

03:30.041 --> 03:31.250
IT'S OUR LAST ONE
THIS SEASON.

03:31.250 --> 03:32.375
AND WE STILL HAVE AN HOUR
BEFORE WE HAVE TO BE THERE.

03:32.375 --> 03:34.792
YEAH, BUT WE GOTTA STOP
BY THE HARDWARE STORE.

03:34.792 --> 03:37.417
WE GOTTA GET PAINT.
WE GOTTA GET
SOME ROLLERS.

03:37.417 --> 03:38.208
ALL RIGHT, WELL, HOLD ON.
IT'S OUR LAST BEACH DAY
OF THE SEASON.

03:38.208 --> 03:40.250
I WANT TO GET THIS ON RECORD.

03:40.250 --> 03:43.125
DAWSON, PLEASE.
NO PICTURES. I LOOK AWFUL.

03:43.125 --> 03:45.291
WELL, NOW YOU'LL LOOK AWFUL
FOR POSTERITY. READY?

03:45.291 --> 03:48.375
1...2...3.

03:48.375 --> 03:50.125
OH! NICE.

03:50.125 --> 03:51.542
WELL, SEE YOU GUYS
AT THE DIVE-IN TONIGHT.

03:51.542 --> 03:54.625
YEP. DAWSON, I HEAR
THEY'RE PLAYING JAWS.

03:54.625 --> 03:55.917
OH! GOOD.
NEVER SEEN THAT ONE YET.

03:55.917 --> 03:56.875
[ALL LAUGH]

03:56.875 --> 03:57.875
SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

03:57.875 --> 03:59.792
SEE YA.
BYE.

04:02.041 --> 04:04.708
OOH!

04:04.708 --> 04:07.417
CUTE BOYS,
2 O'CLOCK.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.166
LIKE IT EVEN MATTERS.

04:10.166 --> 04:13.542
COME ON.
ONE OF US IS SINGLE.

04:13.542 --> 04:14.500
IN THEORY.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.208
BUT IN PRACTICE, ANDIE,
LET'S FACE IT.

04:16.208 --> 04:20.041
YOUR SEX LIFE THIS SUMMER
HAS BEEN AN EPISODE
OF ABSTINENCE IN THE CITY.

04:20.041 --> 04:21.916
WELL, IS IT MY FAULT
IF THIS ONE-HORSE HAMLET

04:21.916 --> 04:24.083
HASN'T OFFERED
A SUITABLE SUMMER FLING?

04:24.083 --> 04:25.542
OH, ANDIE,
THERE ARE PLENTY OF GUYS.

04:25.542 --> 04:27.291
FACE IT. YOU'RE JUST NOT
BOLD ENOUGH TO GO UP
AND TALK TO THEM.

04:27.291 --> 04:29.792
AND IF YOU WERE
IN MY SHOES, YOU WOULD.

04:29.792 --> 04:31.333
YES!

04:31.333 --> 04:33.542
I MEAN, COME ON, I THINK THAT
MY RESUMÉ SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.

04:34.583 --> 04:36.625
FINE. I'M GONNA
GO TALK TO THEM.

04:36.625 --> 04:37.667
OK.
I AM.

04:37.667 --> 04:38.041
YOU GO!

04:38.041 --> 04:38.917
I AM!

04:38.917 --> 04:41.166
WELL?

04:41.166 --> 04:44.583
WELL, I AM
JUST NEGOTIATING
THE PROPER APPROACH.

04:44.583 --> 04:48.875
WELL, EXCUSE ME WHILE I
NEGOTIATE THE PROPER APPROACH
TO THE SNACK BAR.

04:48.875 --> 04:50.375
SCAREDY-CAT.
I AM NOT.

04:50.375 --> 04:50.792
ARE SO.
AM NOT!

04:50.792 --> 04:52.792
ARE SO!

05:02.500 --> 05:05.959
BOY. THAT'S A LITTLE
ON THE HEAVY SIDE.

05:05.959 --> 05:08.083
WHO'S THAT ONE FOR?

05:08.083 --> 05:10.458
UH, MY SISTER, I THINK.
IS THAT EVERYTHING?

05:10.458 --> 05:12.291
YEAH, FOR RIGHT NOW.
I FIGURED WE'D JUST LEAVE

05:12.291 --> 05:12.875
THE REST ON THE BOAT
AND PICK IT UP TOMORROW.

05:12.875 --> 05:15.208
OK.

05:15.208 --> 05:16.417
OH...

05:16.417 --> 05:17.667
UH, BEFORE WE LEAVE,
THOUGH,

05:17.667 --> 05:19.000
THERE IS ONE OTHER THING
WE SHOULD COVER.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.125
WHAT'S THAT?

05:21.125 --> 05:22.333
WELL,
THEY'RE GONNA ASK.

05:22.333 --> 05:25.000
WHO'S GONNA
ASK WHAT?

05:25.000 --> 05:30.125
THE MASSES. THEY'RE
GONNA ASK WHAT HAPPENED
ON THE BOAT.

05:30.125 --> 05:31.708
THIS SUMMER...
BETWEEN YOU AND I...

05:31.708 --> 05:34.041
YOU KNOW...
SEXUALLY SPEAKING.

05:35.166 --> 05:37.667
NO ONE CARES, PACEY.

05:37.667 --> 05:40.417
OK, MAYBE THEY CARE,
BUT THEY'RE NOT
GONNA ASK.

05:40.417 --> 05:41.542
IT'S TOO CRASS.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.625
WE LIVE IN A CRASS AGE.

05:45.333 --> 05:46.000
OK, SO WHAT
ARE YOU GONNA SAY?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.041
THAT REALLY DEPENDS.

05:48.041 --> 05:49.333
ON?

05:49.333 --> 05:51.667
ON WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA SAY.

05:51.667 --> 05:54.125
WELL, I GUESS I'M GOING
TO SAY NOTHING BECAUSE
IT'S NO ONE'S BUSINESS.

05:54.125 --> 05:54.834
THAT'S GOOD.

05:54.834 --> 05:57.583
"NOTHING" SOUNDS PERFECT.

05:57.583 --> 05:59.542
BESIDES, THEY'RE
NOT GONNA ASK.

05:59.542 --> 06:00.583
OH, THEY'LL ASK.

06:06.583 --> 06:07.041
WELL...

06:07.041 --> 06:08.333
THIS IS IT.

06:08.333 --> 06:11.834
LAST OF OUR SUMMER,
AND...

06:11.834 --> 06:13.166
I GO LEFT, YOU GO RIGHT,

06:13.166 --> 06:15.834
AND WE SPEND
THE NEXT WHOLE 24 HOURS
AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.

06:15.834 --> 06:18.708
IF YOU'RE CURIOUS AS
TO WHY I'M NOT CURRENTLY
AWASH IN SADNESS,

06:18.708 --> 06:22.542
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE,
TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST,

06:22.542 --> 06:25.041
YOU WERE STARTIN'
TO GET ON MY NERVES, JO.

06:25.041 --> 06:26.250
OH.

06:27.208 --> 06:28.667
GOOD. WELL,
'CAUSE...YOU KNOW, I...

06:28.667 --> 06:31.875
I'D HATE TO THINK THAT
AFTER ALL OF OUR INTIMATE TALKS,

06:31.875 --> 06:34.375
YOU WERE ACTUALLY
COVERING UP YOUR ACHING HEART

06:34.375 --> 06:35.583
WITH FALSE BRAVADO.

06:35.583 --> 06:37.208
WELL, PUT YOUR MIND
AT EASE.

06:38.375 --> 06:40.125
WELL, I GUESS
I'LL CALL YOU
TOMORROW, MAYBE?

06:40.125 --> 06:42.500
OH...IF YOU THINK
ABOUT IT, SURE.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.041
OK.
GOOD LUCK OUT THERE.

06:43.041 --> 06:45.000
THANKS.

06:56.708 --> 06:59.792
EXCUSE ME.
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THE LIGHT BULBS ARE?

06:59.792 --> 07:01.834
UH, USUALLY UP.

07:01.834 --> 07:02.959
I MEANT WHICH AISLE.

07:02.959 --> 07:04.583
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T WORK HERE.

07:04.583 --> 07:07.083
LUCKY
FOR MANAGEMENT.

07:07.083 --> 07:10.250
UM...IF IT HELPS,
I THINK THEY'RE
ON AISLE 4--

07:10.250 --> 07:11.291
GRETCHEN?

07:11.291 --> 07:13.083
DAWSON?

07:13.083 --> 07:14.000
WOW.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

07:15.000 --> 07:16.250
HI.
HI.

07:16.250 --> 07:17.250
HOW ARE YOU?

07:17.250 --> 07:18.417
I...I'M...

07:18.417 --> 07:20.458
DAMP...AT THE MOMENT.

07:21.417 --> 07:22.917
AND IN THE GRANDER
SCHEME OF THINGS?

07:22.917 --> 07:26.417
I SORT OF HEARD
THROUGH THE FAMILY
ABOUT LAST SPRING.

07:26.417 --> 07:29.500
THAT. UH...I'M FINE.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.417
I'M FINE. AND, UH,
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

07:31.417 --> 07:32.667
STILL HOME FROM COLLEGE
FOR THE SUMMER?

07:32.667 --> 07:34.333
A LITTLE BIT LONGER
THAN THAT.

07:34.333 --> 07:35.333
IT'S NO BIGGIE.
I'M JUST, UH...

07:35.333 --> 07:37.458
TAKIN'
SOME TIME OFF.

07:37.458 --> 07:41.500
OK. WELL...AT THE RISK
OF SOUNDING TRITE,

07:41.500 --> 07:43.542
IT'S...IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

07:43.542 --> 07:45.542
AT THE RISK
OF SOUNDING REDUNDANT,

07:45.542 --> 07:47.166
IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU, TOO.

07:47.166 --> 07:48.291
DAMP AND ALL.

07:48.291 --> 07:49.583
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

07:53.917 --> 07:56.375
OK. I GOT THE PAINT,
YOU GOT THE ROLLERS.

07:56.375 --> 07:57.792
WHO'S THE GIRL?

07:57.792 --> 07:59.291
UH, WHAT GIRL?

07:59.291 --> 08:01.708
THE...GIRL
YOU'RE GONNA PRETEND
TO HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF

08:01.708 --> 08:03.917
UNTIL I ANNOY YOU
WITH THE QUESTION

08:03.917 --> 08:05.583
OVER AND OVER
AND OVER AGAIN.

08:05.583 --> 08:07.375
THAT  GIRL. UH...

08:07.375 --> 08:08.458
LONG STORY.

08:08.458 --> 08:10.125
GOOD, 'CAUSE WE GOT
THE WHOLE NORTH SIDE

08:10.125 --> 08:11.792
OF MRS. HANCOCK'S
TO PAINT.

08:15.291 --> 08:16.750
Joey:
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU!

08:16.750 --> 08:18.333
I'M YOUR SISTER.
I'M ENTITLED TO KNOW.

08:18.333 --> 08:20.458
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.917
I'LL REPHRASE.
I'M YOUR SISTER
WHOM YOU DITCHED

08:21.917 --> 08:23.208
HIGH AND DRY
LAST JUNE.

08:23.208 --> 08:25.166
I'M ENTITLED TO KNOW.

OPEN YOUR GIFT.

08:31.917 --> 08:33.875
IT'S
A CAROLINA JASMINE.

08:33.875 --> 08:35.667
AT NIGHT, IF
THE WIND HIT RIGHT,

08:35.667 --> 08:37.707
WE COULD SMELL THEM
2 MILES OUT
ON THE WATER.

08:37.707 --> 08:40.667
AT NIGHT WHILE
YOU AND PACEY WERE--

08:40.667 --> 08:41.457
QUIT IT.

UNPACKED YET.

08:49.750 --> 08:52.500
WHY IS THERE
AN UNDERWEAR-CLAD STRANGER
IN MY BEDROOM?

08:52.500 --> 08:53.708
THAT'S WHERE HE LIVES.

08:53.708 --> 08:54.542

LOOK AT THAT NUMBER.

09:08.375 --> 09:09.875
BESSIE, I'M SORRY.

09:09.875 --> 09:12.417
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW
DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE.

09:12.417 --> 09:15.041

IT HAS A PLUS NEXT
TO IT, NOT A MINUS.

09:15.041 --> 09:18.500

10:02.250 --> 10:04.083
ANDIE, THEY
CAN HEAR YOU.
DOESN'T MATTER.

10:04.083 --> 10:05.250
ONE OF 'EM BARELY
SPEAKS ANY ENGLISH.

10:05.250 --> 10:06.500
THE OTHER ONE KNOWS
"HELLO," "GOOD-BYE,"

10:06.500 --> 10:07.750
AND THE LYRICS
TO AN 'N SYNC SONG.

10:07.750 --> 10:11.083
WE WOULD LIKE
VERY MUCH FOR YOU
TO TOUR US THE CITY.

10:11.083 --> 10:11.959
WE'D LOVE TO!

10:11.959 --> 10:14.250
UM...SORRY, BOYS.
I'M GONNA HAVE

10:14.250 --> 10:15.708
TO CATCH UP WITH YOU
ON THE RIVIERA.

10:15.708 --> 10:18.000
OK, FRENCHIES,
LET'S GO TOUR CAPESIDE

10:18.000 --> 10:20.750
AND ANY OTHER TERRAIN
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN COVERING.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.583
IT'S A FLORIDA SNOWMAN.
GET IT?

10:25.583 --> 10:28.208
NOTICE
MY FITS OF LAUGHTER.

10:28.208 --> 10:29.542
SO...OH, YEAH.

10:29.542 --> 10:32.125
HOW'S MY FAVORITE
COUCH BEEN?

10:32.125 --> 10:33.333
YOU BEEN KEEPIN' IT
WARM FOR ME?

10:33.333 --> 10:36.208
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY
YOU SHOULD BRING THAT UP.

10:36.208 --> 10:37.625
OH, COME ON, NOW.

10:37.625 --> 10:39.458
YOU'RE
NOT GONNA CAST ME OUT
TO THE WOLVES, ARE YOU?

10:39.458 --> 10:42.291
AH, SEEMS I HAVE TO.
SOMEBODY'S ALREADY
MOVED IN. SORRY.

10:42.291 --> 10:43.458
AH.

10:43.458 --> 10:44.708
YOU AND RUPERT FINALLY
DECIDE TO TIE THE KNOT?

10:44.708 --> 10:46.708
I SEE 3 MONTHS ON THE WATER'S
DONE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

10:46.708 --> 10:48.500
TO IMPROVE
YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR.

10:48.500 --> 10:49.750
DON'T TELL ME THIS
IS A GIRL OR SOMETHING.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.792
WELL, YES. AS A MATTER
OF FACT, IT IS.

10:51.792 --> 10:54.750
OH, WELL, THAT'S
JUST FANTASTIC.

10:54.750 --> 10:55.917
JUST AS I NEED
A PLACE TO SLEEP,

10:55.917 --> 10:56.875
YOU DECIDE TO GET
ALL HETERO ON ME.

10:56.875 --> 10:59.583
AS MUCH AS I WOULD LOVE
TO PUT AN END

10:59.583 --> 11:02.583
TO YOUR INACCURATE COMMENTS
REGARDING MY SEXUALITY,

11:02.583 --> 11:05.959
I ASSURE YOU
THAT THIS RELATIONSHIP
IS PURELY PLATONIC.

11:05.959 --> 11:08.166
GOOD. THEN I'M SURE WHOEVER
MISS MYSTERY GUEST IS

11:08.166 --> 11:11.166
COULDN'T POSSIBLY
BE AS IMPORTANT
AS YOUR BABY BRO, BRO.

11:11.166 --> 11:13.500
THAT'S WHERE
YOU'RE WRONG, 'CAUSE
SHE'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT

11:13.500 --> 11:15.208
AND...EQUALLY RELATED.

11:15.208 --> 11:18.708
SORRY I'M LATE, DOUG.
I STOPPED
AT THE HARDWARE STORE

11:18.708 --> 11:20.625
TO GET SOME LIGHT BULBS.

11:20.625 --> 11:21.834
GRETCHEN?

11:21.834 --> 11:23.667
HA HA!
NICE HAIR,
LOSER.

11:23.667 --> 11:26.208
COME GIVE
YOUR BIG SIS
A HUG.

11:26.208 --> 11:27.583
HEY.
HI.

11:51.834 --> 11:52.041
HELLO?

11:55.417 --> 11:56.625
HELLO.

11:59.375 --> 11:59.834
MRS. LEERY.

12:02.625 --> 12:02.834
MR. LEERY.

12:07.625 --> 12:07.834
DAWSON?

12:54.125 --> 12:55.250
Dawson:
SHE WAS MY FIRST CRUSH.

12:55.250 --> 12:57.333
I WAS, UH...10, 11,
SO SHE MUST'VE BEEN, WHAT,

12:57.333 --> 13:00.333
ALL OF 13?
I WAS SPENDING THE EVENING
AT THE WITTERS' HOUSE,

13:00.333 --> 13:03.708
AND GRETCHEN
AND 2 OF HER FRIENDS
WERE OUT IN THE BACKYARD.

13:03.708 --> 13:07.083
PACEY HAD THE BRILLIANT IDEA
OF WATER BALLOONING
THE WHOLE LOT OF 'EM.

13:07.083 --> 13:09.834
WE WENT TO WORK
FOR ABOUT 2 HOURS,
FILLING WATER BALLOONS.

13:09.834 --> 13:11.250
BY THE TIME
WE'D GOTTEN OUTSIDE,

13:11.250 --> 13:14.083
GRETCHEN AND
HER FRIENDS WERE ALREADY
IN THEIR BATHING SUITS.

13:14.083 --> 13:16.417
THEY MUST'VE
HEARD THE PLOT THROUGH
AN OPEN BATHROOM WINDOW.

13:17.792 --> 13:20.375
AND, UH...OF COURSE,
PACEY DECIDED
TO BALLOON 'EM ANYWAY.

13:20.375 --> 13:23.125
BUT I REMEMBER
JUST...STARING.

13:23.125 --> 13:24.125
AT GRETCHEN.

13:24.125 --> 13:26.125
MM-HMM. YOU'D THINK
I'D NEVER SEEN A GIRL

13:26.125 --> 13:28.625
IN A BATHING SUIT BEFORE.
IT JUST...

13:28.625 --> 13:29.625
HIT ME...

13:29.625 --> 13:31.667
WITHOUT WARNING,
RIGHT THEN AND THERE.

13:31.667 --> 13:32.917
AND FROM THEN ON,
ANY MONEY

13:32.917 --> 13:35.959
THAT WOULD'VE
FORMERLY GONE TO...

13:35.959 --> 13:37.708
BASEBALL CARDS
OR ACTION FIGURES

13:37.708 --> 13:42.125
WAS NOW BEING SPENT
ON CHOCOLATES
AND $5.00 TULIPS

13:42.125 --> 13:44.333
THAT I WOULD LEAVE ANONYMOUSLY
ON GRETCHEN WITTER'S STOOP.

13:47.750 --> 13:49.125
IT WASN'T TILL YEARS LATER
THAT I REALIZED

13:49.125 --> 13:51.041
THAT MY CRUSH HAD BEEN
A RUNNING FAMILY JOKE.

13:51.041 --> 13:53.500
YEAH, RIGHT.
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

13:53.500 --> 13:57.000
SAME THING THAT HAPPENS
WITH ALL ADOLESCENT CRUSHES.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.083
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

14:00.041 --> 14:01.917
I WILL SIMPLY
NOT BE REPLACED.

14:01.917 --> 14:04.667
IT'S TOO DAMAGING
TO MY FRAGILE EGO.

14:04.667 --> 14:06.291
OH, GET OVER YOURSELF.

14:06.291 --> 14:07.667
WHY DON'T YOU
GET OVER YOURSELF?

14:07.667 --> 14:08.834
OK? AREN'T YOU
A COLLEGE STUDENT
OR SOMETHING?

14:08.834 --> 14:10.333
IT'S CALLED
TAKING TIME OFF.

14:10.333 --> 14:12.417
SURE, IT IS.

14:12.417 --> 14:14.500
I'M THE ONLY OTHER WITTER
THAT EUPHEMISM WON'T FOOL.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.875
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS,
LITTLE BROTHER.

14:16.875 --> 14:18.125
LET GO OF
MY LIVING QUARTERS,
AND MAYBE I WON'T DIG UP

14:18.125 --> 14:20.333
WHATEVER SORDID MESS
IT WAS THAT LANDED YOU

14:20.333 --> 14:21.500
IN THIS REMOTE CORNER
OF THE WORLD.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.250
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S ENOUGH, YOU TWO.

14:23.250 --> 14:26.708
NOW, PACEY,
YOU CURRENTLY HAVE
OTHER LIVING OPTIONS.

14:26.708 --> 14:28.208
GRETCHEN DOES NOT.
THANK YOU.

14:28.208 --> 14:30.125
REALLY. AND WHAT MIGHT
THOSE LIVING OPTIONS BE,
DOUGIE?

14:30.125 --> 14:32.542
WELL, FOR STARTERS,
THERE'S YOUR BOAT.

14:32.542 --> 14:34.166
ARE YOU JOKIN'?

14:34.166 --> 14:36.250
I SPENT
THE LAST HUNDRED DAYS
LIVIN' ON THAT THING.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.792
OK, FINE. KERRY AND
THE NO-NECK MONSTERS

14:38.792 --> 14:41.834
ARE STILL AT MOM AND DAD'S,
BUT I BELIEVE THERE IS
A COUCH THERE. AM I WRONG?

14:41.834 --> 14:45.208
OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT WRONG.
I'D JUST AS SOON TAKE
A COT ON DEATH ROW.

14:45.208 --> 14:46.708
HEY, THERE'S
ALWAYS THE ZOO.

14:46.708 --> 14:48.041
DOWN, GRETCHZILLA.

14:48.041 --> 14:50.959
AS USUAL, YOUR
LEVEL OF MATURITY
ASTOUNDS.

14:50.959 --> 14:55.917
I KNOW.
WHY DON'T YOU STAY
WITH JOEY?

14:55.917 --> 14:57.291
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

14:57.291 --> 14:58.917
WELL, YOU HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND NOW.

14:58.917 --> 15:00.208
I'M SURE SHE'D BE
MORE THAN HAPPY

15:00.208 --> 15:03.083
TO SET YOU UP
WITH A LITTLE BED...
OR SHARE HERS.

15:03.083 --> 15:05.125
YOU KNOW, HONESTLY,
I DON'T APPRECIATE
THAT SUGGESTION

15:05.125 --> 15:07.041
OR THE TONE
THAT ACCOMPANIES IT.

15:07.041 --> 15:10.041
YOU KNOW, GRETCHEN'S
GOT A POINT.
I MEAN, UH,

15:10.041 --> 15:12.834
IF ANY PLACE
HAS EXTRA ROOMS,
IT'S A B&B.

15:12.834 --> 15:14.875
I'M NOT GONNA IMPOSE
UPON THAT FAMILY.

15:14.875 --> 15:17.291
YEAH. WHY SHOULD YOU
WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR OWN
TO IMPOSE ON?

15:17.291 --> 15:20.083
AH, GRETCHEN. SO GOOD
TO HAVE YOU HOME.

15:20.083 --> 15:22.250
OH, NO. WHOOPS.
SILLY ME. I DON'T
HAVE A HOME ANYMORE.

15:22.250 --> 15:26.208
HEY, IT PAINS ME
TO SEE YOU THIS WAY.
IT REALLY DOES.

15:26.208 --> 15:27.708
PASS THE ICED TEA.

15:27.708 --> 15:29.000
THANKS.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.208
SO FOOTBALL CAMP LED
TO AN UNEXPECTED SCHOLARSHIP

15:31.208 --> 15:34.083
AT HANOVER ACADEMY,
AND HENRY AND HIS PARENTS

15:34.083 --> 15:36.291
DECIDED THAT
ATTENDING WOULD DOUBLE
HIS COLLEGE OPTIONS,

15:36.291 --> 15:38.667
SO NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
I'M DATING A GUY

15:38.667 --> 15:40.542
WHO GOES
TO BOARDING SCHOOL
4 HOURS AWAY.

15:40.542 --> 15:42.583
THEY'RE DOING
WHAT JENNIFER TERMS

15:42.583 --> 15:45.000
"THE LONG DISTANCE THING."

15:45.000 --> 15:46.083
WHICH, IRONICALLY,
GRAMS DISAPPROVES OF.

15:46.083 --> 15:49.417
YOUTH IS A TIME
TO BE SPENT IN THE NOW,

15:49.417 --> 15:50.917
NOT PINING AWAY
FOR A SOLITARY WEEKEND

15:50.917 --> 15:53.500
EVERY OTHER MONTH
OR SO.

15:53.500 --> 15:56.417
ISN'T THERE A PAIR OF
KNITTING NEEDLES CALLING
YOUR NAME SOMEWHERE?

15:56.417 --> 15:57.166
I SUPPOSE THEY ARE.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.417
GOOD-BYE, JOSEPHINE.

16:00.417 --> 16:03.166
NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK
SAFE AND SOUND.

16:05.917 --> 16:07.750
OK. ENOUGH ME.
YOU'RE THE ONE

16:07.750 --> 16:09.125
FRESH FROM
THE WORLD EXCURSION.

16:09.125 --> 16:10.291
SO?

16:10.291 --> 16:12.959
WE HAD THE TIME
OF OUR LIVES.

16:13.834 --> 16:15.917
I HONESTLY
WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE

16:15.917 --> 16:17.250
TO BEGIN TALKING
ABOUT IT.

16:17.250 --> 16:19.625
WELL, I'LL HELP YOU OUT.
CUT TO THE SORDID STUFF.

16:19.625 --> 16:21.000
JEN.
COME ON, JO.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.792
I WOULDN'T BE HUMAN
IF I DIDN'T
WANT TO KNOW.

16:22.792 --> 16:23.834
YOU AND PACEY,
ALONE ON A BOAT
FOR 3 MONTHS.

16:23.834 --> 16:24.792
EVERYBODY'S
GONNA ASK.

16:24.792 --> 16:27.750
WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT IT.

16:27.750 --> 16:30.792
WITH MY EXPERIENCE
WITH THAT PARTICULAR
YES-OR-NO QUESTION,

16:30.792 --> 16:32.959
"NO" MEANS "NO," AND
"WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT IT"

16:32.959 --> 16:34.750
MEANS "WE DID IT."

16:35.542 --> 16:36.500
YOU GOT ME.

16:36.500 --> 16:37.917
WE DID IT...

16:37.917 --> 16:39.750
ALL DAY, ALL NIGHT,
24-7.

16:39.750 --> 16:44.250
ARE YOU AWARE THAT
THERE ARE AT LEAST 38 KNOWN
DIFFERING SEXUAL POSITIONS?

16:44.250 --> 16:45.917
AND 42 IF
YOU'RE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH.

16:45.917 --> 16:48.834
OK, IT'S NONE
OF MY BUSINESS.

16:56.708 --> 16:59.542
JEN, HOW IS
EVERYONE ELSE DOING?

16:59.542 --> 17:00.750
GOOD.

17:01.417 --> 17:02.333
YEAH, EVERYBODY'S GOOD.

17:06.458 --> 17:07.583
I SHOULD
PROBABLY BE GOING.

17:07.583 --> 17:09.875
I PROMISED BESSIE
I'D HELP WITH DINNER.

17:09.875 --> 17:11.416
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU
DOIN' TONIGHT?

17:11.416 --> 17:12.250
YOU AND PACEY
JUST LAYIN' LOW?

17:12.250 --> 17:14.541
NO, WE'RE NOT
DOING ANYTHING.

17:14.541 --> 17:16.834
WE'RE TAKING OUR FIRST
OFFICIAL NIGHT OFF
FROM EACH OTHER.

17:16.834 --> 17:19.165
WELL, WE ARE GOING
TO THE DIVE-IN. WHY
DON'T YOU JOIN US?

17:19.165 --> 17:22.750
I DON'T KNOW
THAT THAT'S
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.416
8:00, STUPMUCK COVE, AND
I'M GONNA TELL EVERYBODY
THAT YOU'LL BE THERE.

17:29.041 --> 17:30.083
BYE.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.291
Andie: AND ON YOUR RIGHT

17:31.291 --> 17:32.500
WE HAVE
A VERY HISTORIC BUILDING

17:32.500 --> 17:34.625
WHERE MANY HISTORIC
EVENTS OCCURRED.

17:34.625 --> 17:37.417
SORRY. HOPE
I'M NOT BORING YOU
WITH ALL THE SPECIFICS.

17:37.417 --> 17:39.750
OH, NO, NO.
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL
WHEN YOU SPEAK.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.125
WELL, STOP! HA HA!

17:41.125 --> 17:45.542
UH, NO, I DIDN'T
REALLY MEAN "STOP."

17:45.542 --> 17:48.041
I AM SORRY.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:48.041 --> 17:49.875
NEVER MIND.

17:49.875 --> 17:52.542
SO, UH...
DOES HE EVER SPEAK?

17:52.542 --> 17:53.917
EH, TU NE VEUX PAS
PARLER UN PETIT--

17:53.917 --> 17:56.375
NON, JE NE PEUX PARLER.

17:57.375 --> 17:58.417
WHEN HE WANTS.

18:00.583 --> 18:02.708
SO...ANYWAY, UH,
WHAT'S YOUR TOWN LIKE?

18:02.708 --> 18:05.291
I COME FROM PARIS.
HAVE YOU BEEN?

18:05.291 --> 18:08.917
OH...NO, BUT I
WANT TO GO DESPERATELY.

18:08.917 --> 18:10.458
WHY?

18:10.458 --> 18:12.792
'CAUSE IT'S
THE CITY OF ROMANCE!

18:12.792 --> 18:16.500
IT'S...IT'S
THE CITY OF LOVE
LOST AND FOUND.

18:16.500 --> 18:19.166
IT'S DEGAS AND CÉZANNE
AND MONET AND VAN GOGH.

18:19.166 --> 18:21.417
I MEAN, EVEN THOUGH
I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE,

18:21.417 --> 18:23.458
IT'S LIKE I KNOW IT
BETTER THAN MY OWN HOME.

18:23.458 --> 18:25.333
ELLE CONNAÜT LA VILLE
SI BIEN

18:25.333 --> 18:26.959
PARCE QUE C'EST
DANS SON COEUR, NON?

18:26.959 --> 18:27.917
WHAT'D HE SAY?

18:27.917 --> 18:29.250
HE SAID
YOU KNOW IT SO WELL

18:29.250 --> 18:31.625
BECAUSE
IT'S IN YOUR HEART.

18:31.625 --> 18:34.208
OH. [CHUCKLES]

18:39.917 --> 18:42.333
[SIGHS]
SO HOW'D SHE LOOK?

18:42.333 --> 18:43.291
DAWSON.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.375
IT'S A QUESTION.

18:47.792 --> 18:49.250
SHE LOOKED GREAT.

18:49.250 --> 18:50.417
GREAT.

18:50.792 --> 18:52.417
GREAT.

18:52.417 --> 18:53.792
YOU SURE THE LIGHT
WASN'T IN YOUR EYES?

18:53.792 --> 18:56.125
SHE DIDN'T GROW A HUMP

18:56.125 --> 18:58.125
OR DEVELOP SOME
HIDEOUS SKIN DISORDER
OR SOMETHING?

18:58.125 --> 19:01.458
DOES THIS MEAN THAT YOU
DON'T WANT TO SEE HER?

19:01.458 --> 19:03.083
UM...I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

19:03.083 --> 19:06.542
GOOD, BECAUSE I INVITED
HER TO COME WITH US
TO THE DIVE-IN TONIGHT.

19:06.542 --> 19:08.542
YOU...

19:08.542 --> 19:09.333
[CHUCKLES]

19:09.333 --> 19:11.291
HOW VERY THOUGHTFUL
OF YOU.

19:11.291 --> 19:13.708
DAWSON, COME ON.
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DISPENSE

19:13.708 --> 19:15.166
WITH
THE AWKWARD INTROS
SOONER OR LATER,

19:15.166 --> 19:16.417
SO WHY NOT--

19:16.417 --> 19:18.834
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE NATURAL
PROGRESSION OF THINGS?

19:18.834 --> 19:20.041
HMM?

19:20.792 --> 19:22.333
JOEY NATURALLY
CAME OVER,

19:22.333 --> 19:24.959
AND I NATURALLY
INVITED HER.

19:24.959 --> 19:26.083
I DON'T KNOW.

19:26.083 --> 19:27.792
SO, IS WHAT'S-HIS-NAME
GONNA BE THERE?

19:27.792 --> 19:30.250
UH, NO. NO, THEY'RE
TAKIN' THE NIGHT OFF.

19:30.250 --> 19:32.667
WHICH WOULD MAKE THIS
THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

19:32.667 --> 19:34.708
FOR THE TWO OF YOU
TO HAVE YOUR INEVITABLE
GENEVA CONFERENCE

19:34.708 --> 19:37.792
WHERE YOU DECIDE
TO REMAIN FRIENDS FOREVER
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.

19:37.792 --> 19:39.667
WHY ARE YOU
SO RESOLUTE ABOUT THIS?

19:40.750 --> 19:41.959
[LAUGHS]

19:43.417 --> 19:45.000
I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS IT...

19:45.000 --> 19:48.125
JUST IN THINKING BACK
TO THE WAY EVERYTHING
WENT DOWN LAST YEAR,

19:48.125 --> 19:51.208
YOU KNOW...
HOW YOU FOUND OUT
AND ALL, I--

19:51.208 --> 19:52.250
WHAT, YOU FEEL
RESPONSIBLE?

19:52.250 --> 19:53.375
YES, I DO.
WOULDN'T YOU?

19:56.625 --> 19:59.000
LOOK, THE ONLY THING
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR

19:59.000 --> 20:01.417
IS HELPING ME HAVE ARGUABLY
THE BEST SUMMER OF MY LIFE.

20:12.667 --> 20:14.500
AHEM!

20:14.500 --> 20:15.542
DAWSON.

20:15.542 --> 20:16.041
JEN.

20:16.041 --> 20:18.208
DAWSON AND JEN.

20:18.208 --> 20:19.708
WELCOME
TO THE LEERY HOUSE

20:19.708 --> 20:22.417
WHERE IT'S DÉJÀ SCREW
ALL OVER AGAIN.

20:22.417 --> 20:23.417
WELL, UH, WE WERE
JUST, UH, GOIN' OVER

20:23.417 --> 20:27.917
THE POSSIBLE RENOVATIONS
FOR THE HOME.

20:27.917 --> 20:30.917
YOU'RE DYING
ON THE VINE, DEAR.

20:30.917 --> 20:34.583
[CHUCKLING]
LATER, MRS. LEERY,
MR. LEERY.

20:35.542 --> 20:38.500
YOU, UH...SAID
YOU CHECKED THE ROOMS.

20:38.500 --> 20:39.542
I DID.

20:39.542 --> 20:41.041
MM-HMM. WELL, YOU DIDN'T
CHECK THE DARKROOM.

20:41.041 --> 20:42.375
I DIDN'T COUNT
THE DARKROOM.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.500
FROM NOW ON,
THE DARKROOM COUNTS.

20:53.250 --> 20:53.458
GUESS WHO.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.208
MMM...WELL,
LET'S SEE...

20:56.208 --> 20:59.083
IT CAN'T POSSIBLY
BE MY BOYFRIEND.

20:59.083 --> 21:00.792
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO SEE EACH OTHER
TILL TOMORROW.

21:00.792 --> 21:02.041
HE--HE WAS
GROWING SICK OF ME.

21:02.041 --> 21:04.917
YEAH, THAT WAS
BEFORE HE FOUND OUT
HE WAS HOMELESS

21:04.917 --> 21:06.458
AND NEEDED TO BUM
A COUCH FOR THE NIGHT.

21:06.458 --> 21:08.333
HMM?
MMM.

21:08.333 --> 21:09.917
TRY AGAIN.
B&B's BOOKED.

21:09.917 --> 21:11.625
I'M ON THE COUCH MYSELF
UNTIL TUESDAY.

21:13.083 --> 21:15.500
IS IT JUST ME, OR
ARE YOU STARTING TO GET
THE DISTINCT FEELING

21:15.500 --> 21:18.750
THAT THIS TOWN
REALLY DIDN'T MISS US
ALL THAT MUCH?

21:20.291 --> 21:22.083
IT'S LIKE THE REVERSE OF
IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.

21:22.083 --> 21:22.917
EVERYONE'S BETTER OFF
WITHOUT US.

21:22.917 --> 21:24.500
EXCEPT FOR EACH OTHER.

21:26.458 --> 21:27.667
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO TONIGHT?

21:27.667 --> 21:29.250
WANT TO GRAB SOME PIZZA,
HANG OUT ON THE BOAT?

21:29.250 --> 21:31.417
OR I WAS THINKING
MAYBE WE COULD GO CATCH
A BAD SUMMER MOVIE

21:31.417 --> 21:33.417
AT THE $1.50 THEATER.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

21:33.417 --> 21:34.542
WELL, UH...

21:34.542 --> 21:37.834
ACTUALLY, UH,
JEN INVITED ME
TO THE DIVE-IN.

21:39.542 --> 21:42.250
THE DIVE-IN.
EVERYBODY FROM SCHOOL'S
GONNA BE AT THE DIVE-IN.

21:42.250 --> 21:46.583
TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST,
I DON'T THINK I'M PREPARED
FOR THAT QUITE YET.

21:52.750 --> 21:53.625
WERE YOU GONNA GO
WITHOUT ME?

21:55.750 --> 21:57.458
WE CAN JUST GO
TOGETHER.

21:57.458 --> 22:00.291
I THINK IT'D BE FUN...
AND...AND HEALTHY...

22:00.291 --> 22:02.500
YOU KNOW,
TO SEE EVERYONE.

22:02.500 --> 22:03.708
TO SEE DAWSON.

22:03.708 --> 22:06.208
YES...TO SEE DAWSON,

22:06.208 --> 22:08.125
WHICH WE'VE
TALKED ABOUT, PACEY.

22:08.125 --> 22:10.792
AND IT'S NO SECRET THAT
I'M ANXIOUS TO GET THINGS
SQUARED AWAY WITH HIM.

22:10.792 --> 22:12.291
NO, IT'S NO SECRET.

22:12.291 --> 22:14.625
AND TO BE PERFECTLY
HONEST, LOOK,

22:14.625 --> 22:17.125
I DON'T REALLY CARE
WHERE WE GO
OR WHAT WE DO

22:17.125 --> 22:17.542
AS LONG AS
WE DO IT TOGETHER.

22:30.333 --> 22:31.000
[CHUCKLES]

22:31.000 --> 22:33.208
THANK YOU.

23:21.375 --> 23:22.542
[PEOPLE SCREAM]

23:24.708 --> 23:28.000
HEY! YOU GUYS GO ON IN.
I'LL BE IN IN A SECOND.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.542
AH. LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
FOUND SOME NEW FRIENDS.

23:32.542 --> 23:34.208
DON'T FORGET, ANDIE.
IT WAS THE FRENCH

23:34.208 --> 23:35.875
WHO COINED THE TERM
"MÉNAGE À TROIS."

23:35.875 --> 23:38.166
MÉNAGE À I-DON'T-THINK-SO.

23:38.166 --> 23:40.625
BESIDES, I ONLY LIKE THE ONE
WHO SPEAKS ENGLISH.

23:40.625 --> 23:42.583
THE OTHER ONE
JUST STANDS THERE
LOOKING LIKE A DOLT.

23:42.583 --> 23:43.917
SO DO YOU KNOW
IF HE'S SINGLE YET?

23:43.917 --> 23:45.583
I'M WORKING ON IT.

23:45.583 --> 23:47.458
GIVE ME AN HOUR.

23:47.458 --> 23:49.250
UNBELIEVABLE.

24:00.208 --> 24:02.458
I THOUGHT
YOU SAID HE WASN'T
GONNA BE HERE, JEN.

24:05.250 --> 24:06.375
HE WASN'T, DAWSON.

24:06.375 --> 24:08.208
SO WHY IS HE HERE,
JEN?

24:08.208 --> 24:09.917
GOOD QUESTION, DAWSON.

24:09.917 --> 24:12.291
[SIGHS]

24:15.583 --> 24:18.166
MAYBE THIS WASN'T
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

24:18.166 --> 24:20.959
WELL, IT WASN'T MY IDEA
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

24:24.041 --> 24:24.417
DO YOU THINK THAT...

24:24.417 --> 24:27.583
UM...

24:27.583 --> 24:29.458
THAT MAYBE I
SHOULD GO AND GET US
SOMETHING TO DRINK

24:29.458 --> 24:31.417
WHILE YOU GO
AND SAY HI?

24:31.417 --> 24:32.333
SURE.

24:32.333 --> 24:34.125
I MEAN, I JUST THINK
IT'LL BE EASIER.

24:34.125 --> 24:35.792
YEAH. NO PROBLEM.

24:35.792 --> 24:36.834
I'LL BE BACK
IN A COUPLE MINUTES.

24:36.834 --> 24:38.041
OK.

24:42.667 --> 24:44.125
OK. WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

24:44.125 --> 24:46.333
TO GET A BETTER SEAT.

24:46.333 --> 24:47.417
I DON'T MIND SEEING HER,
BUT I'M NOT GOING

24:47.417 --> 24:48.458
TO GO OUT OF MY WAY
TO TALK TO HER.

24:48.458 --> 24:50.291
CAN'T YOU GO OUT OF MY WAY
TO TALK TO HER?

24:52.458 --> 24:53.500
YOU WORK HIM.

24:53.500 --> 24:54.959
YOU WORK HER.

24:54.959 --> 24:55.917
YOU GOT IT.

24:57.333 --> 24:58.708
JOEY, HEY!

24:58.708 --> 24:59.750
HEY!

24:59.750 --> 25:00.792
WHAT'S UP?
HOW ARE YOU?

25:00.792 --> 25:01.875
I'M GOOD.
HOW ARE YOU?

25:01.875 --> 25:02.333
I'M GOOD.
COME ON IN.

25:02.333 --> 25:03.834
THANKS.

25:03.834 --> 25:05.667
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

25:05.667 --> 25:08.166
OH, SOMEONE'S BEEN
LIFTING THIS SUMMER.

25:08.166 --> 25:13.291
AH, YEAH.
WELL, WHAT ELSE IS THERE
TO DO IN THIS TOWN, RIGHT?

25:13.291 --> 25:15.750
SO, WHERE'D
EVERYONE GO?

25:15.750 --> 25:17.500
UH...

25:19.959 --> 25:22.000
YOU KNOW,
IT'S ONE THING
TO USURP THE COUCH,

25:22.000 --> 25:23.458
BUT IT'S QUITE ANOTHER
TO COME BACK HERE

25:23.458 --> 25:25.500
AND BEST
MY SOCIAL STANDING.

25:25.500 --> 25:26.959
DO YOU WANT
TO TAKE A WALK?

25:27.333 --> 25:29.041
YEAH.

25:31.250 --> 25:32.875
Gretchen: DO YOU HATE ME
FOR TAKING YOUR SPOT?

25:32.875 --> 25:35.125
SPOT? TRY "BED."

25:35.125 --> 25:36.125
HMM. YOU HATE ME.

25:36.125 --> 25:38.583
MARGINALLY, YEAH.

25:38.583 --> 25:40.917
WELL, RETRIBUTION
IS YOURS.

25:40.917 --> 25:44.917
DOUG WAKES ME UP
EVERY MORNING AT 7:00
DUST-BUSTERING THE KITCHEN.

25:44.917 --> 25:47.750
IT'S LIKE LIVING WITH
FELIX UNGER ON CRACK.

25:47.750 --> 25:49.959
WELL, YOU'RE
HARDLY AN INNOCENT.

25:49.959 --> 25:51.041
LAST WE ROOMED
TOGETHER,

25:51.041 --> 25:53.583
YOU WERE KNOWN
TO BLARE ROCK MUSIC
SO LOUD

25:53.583 --> 25:57.166
SMALL NATIONS
WERE KEPT UP.

25:57.166 --> 25:59.458
NOT ROCK, PACEY.
SOUL.

25:59.458 --> 26:00.375
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

26:00.375 --> 26:01.708
YEAH, THERE
IS A DIFFERENCE.

26:01.708 --> 26:02.959
FANS LISTEN
TO ROCK MUSIC.

26:02.959 --> 26:06.834
PRETENTIOUS
FANS LISTEN
TO SOUL MUSIC.

26:06.834 --> 26:10.625
IS IT POSSIBLE
YOU'VE ACTUALLY GROWN
MORE OBNOXIOUS OVER TIME?

26:10.625 --> 26:11.625
WELL, IT IS
THE WITTER WAY.

26:11.625 --> 26:15.083
HMM. AND SOMEHOW
YOU STILL GOT THE GIRL.

26:15.083 --> 26:16.708
YES, I DID.

26:19.875 --> 26:22.125
WHO WOULD'VE EVER THUNK
ME AND JOEY WOULD
END UP TOGETHER, HUH?

26:22.125 --> 26:24.667
MMM...ME.

26:24.667 --> 26:26.000
YOU DID NOT.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.667
IT DIDN'T TAKE NOSTRADAMUS
TO CALL IT.

26:27.667 --> 26:28.625
I MEAN,
LOOK AT YOUR SIMILARITIES.

26:28.625 --> 26:32.667
YOU'RE BOTH CLASSIC
SCRAPPY UNDERDOGS.

26:32.667 --> 26:37.375
SHE'S SASSY AND YOU'RE
A LEGENDARY ANNOYANCE.

26:37.375 --> 26:43.333
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL
AND YOU'RE...LUCKY.

26:43.333 --> 26:44.750
THERE
IS A COMPLIMENT

26:44.750 --> 26:45.417
IN THERE SOMEWHERE,
RIGHT?

26:45.417 --> 26:48.041
YOU'RE BOTH LUCKY.

26:48.041 --> 26:49.333
THANK YOU.

26:51.500 --> 26:52.834
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU,
GRETCHEN?

26:52.834 --> 26:57.083
HONESTLY. WHY WOULD
YOU COME BACK HERE?

26:57.083 --> 27:01.834
I'M JUST, UH,
TAKING A BREAK.
THAT'S ALL.

27:01.834 --> 27:03.041
ALL RIGHT.

27:03.041 --> 27:05.583
WELL, AS THEY SAY
IN NON-DYSFUNCTIONAL
FAMILIES,

27:05.583 --> 27:08.417
WELCOME HOME,
GRETCHEN.

27:08.417 --> 27:11.000
AND, UH,
SPEAKING OF HOME,

27:11.000 --> 27:14.375
I HAVE A SUGGESTION
THAT I THINK YOU
MIGHT FIND APPEALING.

27:14.375 --> 27:16.125
YEAH?

27:26.792 --> 27:28.083
ASK ME A QUESTION.

27:29.875 --> 27:30.792
I GET IT.

27:30.792 --> 27:31.917
IT'S THE OLD, "LET'S
MAKE SMALL TALK

27:31.917 --> 27:32.875
UNTIL HE
COMES OVER," RIGHT?

27:32.875 --> 27:36.458
PRECISELY.
JUST ASK ME A QUESTION.

27:36.458 --> 27:38.834
ACTUALLY, I DO
HAVE A QUESTION.

27:41.291 --> 27:41.959
NOT THAT  QUESTION.

27:41.959 --> 27:42.792
COME ON!
JACK!

27:42.792 --> 27:45.166
I WON'T TELL
ANYBODY. I SWEAR.

27:45.166 --> 27:47.708
SHE'S DOING THE OFFICIAL
"WAIT FOR DAWSON
TO COME OVER" THING.

27:47.708 --> 27:49.917
IT LOOKS TO ME
MORE LIKE THE OFFICIAL

27:49.917 --> 27:52.625
"WAIT IN VAIN FOR DAWSON
TO COME OVER" THING.

27:54.458 --> 27:55.625
ONE MORE JOKE LIKE THAT
AND I AM REALLY
GOING TO KNOW

27:55.625 --> 27:57.583
HOW HARD
THIS IS FOR YOU.

27:57.583 --> 28:00.000
IT'S NOT HARD.
COME ON.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.417
IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT EASY,
BUT IT'S NOT HARD.

28:02.417 --> 28:04.333
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS,
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GO GET IT OVER WITH?

28:04.333 --> 28:07.667
I'LL DO IT,
BUT IT'S JUST A HIGHLY
PREDICTABLE MOMENT.

28:07.667 --> 28:09.000
I'M GOING
TO WALK OVER THERE,

28:09.000 --> 28:12.417
JOEY AND I
ARE GONNA ENGAGE IN SOME
SEMI-CASUAL CONVERSATION

28:12.417 --> 28:14.417
UNTIL THE AWKWARDNESS
OVERWHELMS US BOTH,

28:14.417 --> 28:16.166
AND THEN
WE'RE JUST GONNA PART...

28:17.667 --> 28:18.834
EACH OF US
SURPRISED AT HOW
SURPRISINGLY PAINLESS

28:18.834 --> 28:22.417
THE WHOLE ENCOUNTER
SURPRISINGLY WAS.

28:22.417 --> 28:24.875
WELL THEN, SURPRISE ME
AND GO ON OVER THERE.

28:27.500 --> 28:28.834
ALL RIGHT.

28:35.083 --> 28:36.375
HEY.

28:36.375 --> 28:37.834
HEY.

28:42.208 --> 28:44.417
YEAH. I'M GONNA
GO FIND JEN.

28:44.417 --> 28:46.875
SHE'S RIGHT OVER THERE.
OK. THANKS.

28:51.166 --> 28:52.500
SO, HOW'S IT GOING?

28:52.500 --> 28:55.208
UH, GREAT. GREAT.
IT'S GOING GREAT.

28:56.792 --> 28:57.834
Joey:
HOW WAS YOUR SUMMER?

28:57.834 --> 28:59.917
UH, IT WAS BRIEF
BUT GOOD.

29:02.875 --> 29:05.166
YOURS?

29:05.166 --> 29:08.125
BRIEF BUT GOOD.

29:08.125 --> 29:09.917
YOU LOOK GREAT.

29:09.917 --> 29:10.542
HEY, YOU, TOO.

29:10.542 --> 29:12.250
THANKS.
YOU, TOO.

29:12.250 --> 29:15.041
THANKS.

29:25.500 --> 29:27.750
SO, UH...

29:27.750 --> 29:29.708
SCHOOL'S MONDAY--
SCHOOL'S IN--

29:29.708 --> 29:29.917
YEAH.

29:38.959 --> 29:39.959
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

29:43.917 --> 29:45.500
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU, TOO.

30:12.792 --> 30:15.792
OH, UH, HOLD ON
A MINUTE, GUYS.

30:15.792 --> 30:19.166
THERE'S SOMEONE
THAT I'M NOT QUITE
READY TO SEE YET.

30:21.834 --> 30:24.375
UH...
HOW DO YOU SAY

30:24.375 --> 30:27.375
EX-BOYFRIEND?

30:27.375 --> 30:29.417
I UNDERSTAND.

30:30.834 --> 30:34.041
SO DO YOU HAPPEN
TO BE IN A, UM...

30:34.041 --> 30:36.041
HER NAME IS NICOLE.

30:36.041 --> 30:38.375
AND I BET YOU'RE
CRAZY ABOUT HER,
AREN'T YOU?

30:38.375 --> 30:39.542
TO BORROW YOUR WORDS,

30:39.542 --> 30:41.667
SHE'S MONET,
DEGAS, CéZANNE--

30:41.667 --> 30:44.583
OK, I GET THE POINT.

30:47.750 --> 30:49.000
OF COURSE
HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.333
HE'S CUTE.
HE HAS AN ACCENT,

30:52.333 --> 30:53.750
AND HE TELLS ME
THAT I'M BEAUTIFUL,

30:53.750 --> 30:55.166
SO OF COURSE HE HAS
A GIRLFRIEND, RIGHT?

30:55.166 --> 30:56.458
I MEAN, YOU GUYS
ARE ALL THE SAME.

30:56.458 --> 30:58.500
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF YOU'RE FRENCH,
AMERICAN, ENGLISH,

30:58.500 --> 31:00.625
GERMAN, RUSSIAN,
DUTCH, FRENCH.

31:00.625 --> 31:03.083
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?

31:03.083 --> 31:04.625
A VERY RUDE GIRL.

31:04.625 --> 31:06.708
OK, YOU DON'T
EVEN KNOW ME, SO--

31:07.917 --> 31:11.208
UH...
YOU DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH.

31:11.208 --> 31:13.583
I HAVE IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY
THAT I DO.

31:13.583 --> 31:15.375
OK, BUT YOU GUYS
TOLD ME--

31:15.375 --> 31:17.083
IT WAS A JOKE.

31:17.083 --> 31:18.667
THE NAME'S J.J.

31:18.667 --> 31:21.375
SHORT FOR JOHN-JOHN,
NOT JEAN-JEAN.

31:21.375 --> 31:24.208
SO THAT MEANS
THAT ALL DAY YOU--

31:24.208 --> 31:26.208
UNDERSTOOD
EVERY WORD YOU SAID.

31:28.083 --> 31:31.083
PARDON MOI.
I'M JUST GONNA
GO DROWN MYSELF.

31:42.417 --> 31:44.417
THERE YOU ARE.

31:44.417 --> 31:46.291
AND HERE WE GO.

31:46.291 --> 31:47.708
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

31:47.708 --> 31:49.875
BOTH OF US A FAVOR.
TAKING US HOME.

31:49.875 --> 31:52.291
YOU DON'T EVEN ASK ME
IF I WANT TO GO?

31:52.291 --> 31:54.208
DO I HAVE TO?

31:54.208 --> 31:57.542
MAYBE I'M
HAVING A FUN TIME.

31:57.542 --> 31:59.917
IF THIS IS HOW
YOU LOOK WHEN YOU'RE
ENJOYING YOURSELF, JO,

31:59.917 --> 32:02.000
THEN YOU WEREN'T
HAVING A VERY GOOD TIME
ON THE BOAT THIS SUMMER,

32:02.000 --> 32:03.083
'CAUSE YOU NEVER ONCE
LOOKED LIKE THIS.

32:03.083 --> 32:06.250
AND YOU NEVER ONCE
BEHAVED LIKE THIS.

32:06.250 --> 32:07.959
AND JUST
HOW AM I BEHAVING?

32:07.959 --> 32:10.125
I DON'T KNOW YET.
CURRENTLY I'M DECIDING

32:10.125 --> 32:12.083
BETWEEN ASININE,
IMMATURE CHILD

32:12.083 --> 32:15.000
AND ARROGANT,
INFANTILE BOYFRIEND.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.875
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T
WANT TO COME HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

32:16.875 --> 32:18.417
WELL, THEN,
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE COME.

32:21.083 --> 32:24.375
YEAH. I GUESS YOU WOULD
HAVE LOVED THAT, HUH?

32:24.375 --> 32:25.834
WOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU
ALL THE TIME
IN THE WORLD

32:25.834 --> 32:27.625
TO SQUARE THINGS AWAY
WITH DAWSON.

32:27.625 --> 32:29.083
THOSE WERE
YOUR WORDS, RIGHT?
"SQUARE THINGS AWAY"?

32:29.083 --> 32:31.792
PACEY, DEALING WITH DAWSON
IS A REALITY FOR ME.

32:31.792 --> 32:33.083
IT'S A REALITY
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

32:33.083 --> 32:34.000
THE GUY HATES ME, OK?
I CAN'T FIX THAT.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.875
WELL, YOU COULD TRY.
I DON'T WANT TO!

32:36.875 --> 32:39.708
WELL, I DO,
AND I'M SORRY IF YOU
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT!

32:39.708 --> 32:41.458
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THAT!

32:41.458 --> 32:43.583
YOU'RE NOT EVEN UNPACKED
YET AND THE FIRST THINK
YOU THINK TO DO IS--

32:43.583 --> 32:45.208
LOOK I CAN'T HELP IT
IF HE'S BEEN ON MY MIND,

32:45.208 --> 32:46.458
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
WHAT YOU THINK IT MEANS.

32:46.458 --> 32:48.417
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.
I DON'T CARE WHAT IT MEANS.

32:48.417 --> 32:50.000
I'VE JUST WATCHED YOU GROW
MORE AND MORE PREOCCUPIED

32:50.000 --> 32:52.708
EVERY DAY THIS WEEK,
AND I'M TIRED OF IT.

32:52.708 --> 32:54.792
AND IT BETTER STOP.

32:54.792 --> 32:57.750
YOU BETTER WATCH WHO
YOU'RE ORDERING AROUND, PACEY.

32:57.750 --> 32:59.792
WE'RE NOT ON THE BOAT
AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN FOR A DAY.

32:59.792 --> 33:01.625
WHO ARE YOU KIDDING, JO?

33:01.625 --> 33:05.834
COME ON. YOU GOT OFF
THAT BOAT LONG BEFORE
THE TWO OF US DID.

33:05.834 --> 33:07.708
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

33:07.708 --> 33:10.792
YOU'RE A SMART GIRL, JO.
YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT.

33:28.417 --> 33:30.083
STILL HERE, HUH?

33:32.166 --> 33:33.542
YEAH.
I WAS JUST THINKING.

33:33.542 --> 33:36.250
A HIGHLY OVERRATED ACTIVITY,
IF YOU ASK ME.

33:39.166 --> 33:40.291
SO, ARE YOU
HEADING HOME?

33:40.291 --> 33:42.250
YEAH.

33:42.250 --> 33:43.458
DO YOU NEED A RIDE?

33:44.959 --> 33:47.667
I WOULD LIKE THAT,
DAWSON.

33:50.083 --> 33:54.041
ANDIE, YOU WERE
A WONDERFUL HOST.

33:54.041 --> 33:55.959
IF YOU COME TO PARIS,
YOU MUST LOOK ME UP.

33:55.959 --> 33:59.333
OK. YOU HAVE A DEAL,
JEAN.

33:59.333 --> 34:01.708
EXCUSEZ-MOI.

34:05.208 --> 34:07.959
THAT, UM, GOES FOR ME,
TOO, YOU KNOW.

34:07.959 --> 34:09.166
[LAUGHS]

34:09.166 --> 34:11.625
I CAN'T BELIEVE
AFTER EVERYTHING
YOU HEARD ME SAY

34:11.625 --> 34:13.208
THAT YOU'D STILL
WANT TO HANG OUT
WITH ME.

34:13.208 --> 34:15.208
ME EITHER.

34:15.208 --> 34:18.833
OK, I THINK
I LIKED YOU BETTER
BEFORE YOU SPOKE ENGLISH.

34:21.500 --> 34:24.458
THERE'S A QUESTION IN FRENCH.
IT'S VERY POPULAR.

34:24.458 --> 34:27.208
THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION,
IF I CAN REMEMBER CORRECTLY,

34:27.208 --> 34:29.083
GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

34:29.083 --> 34:31.500
CAN I KISS YOU?

34:34.250 --> 34:35.291
OUI.

34:47.041 --> 34:51.083
SO, TELL ME ABOUT
THIS NEWLY ACQUIRED
LOVE OF PHOTOGRAPHY

34:51.083 --> 34:53.625
THAT SEEMS TO HAVE
SPRUNG UP IN MY ABSENCE.

34:53.625 --> 34:56.417
UH, I PICKED IT UP
OVER THE SUMMER.

34:56.417 --> 34:57.667
DIDN'T THINK
I'D LIKE IT

34:57.667 --> 34:58.166
NEARLY AS MUCH
AS I HAVE,

34:58.166 --> 35:00.417
BUT, YOU KNOW,

35:00.417 --> 35:01.792
I GUESS
THAT'S THE WAY
IT ALWAYS IS, HUH?

35:01.792 --> 35:03.125
WHAT'S THAT?

35:03.125 --> 35:05.208
YOU DON'T CHOOSE
WHAT YOU LOVE,
IT CHOOSES YOU.

35:11.458 --> 35:13.000
DAWSON, UH...

35:15.792 --> 35:19.458
I'M VERY SORRY.

35:19.458 --> 35:23.542
I'M SORRY FOR EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR

35:23.542 --> 35:29.708
AND FOR DOING
WHAT I HAD TO DO.

35:29.708 --> 35:34.583
I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS
AND PROBABLY STILL MUST BE.

35:37.250 --> 35:39.959
IT WASN'T EASY...

35:39.959 --> 35:42.917
THINKING ABOUT
THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER
EVERY DAY, EVERY NIGHT.

35:47.166 --> 35:48.583
YOU'RE ACTUALLY
THE ONLY PERSON

35:48.583 --> 35:52.875
WHO HASN'T DARED
ASK THE BIG QUESTION.

35:52.875 --> 35:55.834
I'M THE ONLY PERSON
THE ANSWER COULD
POTENTIALLY KILL.

35:56.792 --> 35:59.208
WAIT HERE.

36:06.125 --> 36:07.333
IT'S FOR YOU.

36:09.041 --> 36:10.250
OK.

36:13.500 --> 36:16.291
WOW.
IT'S MY VERY OWN BRICK.

36:16.291 --> 36:17.291
IT'S NOT JUST A BRICK.

36:17.291 --> 36:19.417
IT'S FROM HEMINGWAY'S
HOME IN THE KEYS.

36:21.750 --> 36:22.875
ERNEST?

36:22.875 --> 36:24.583
NO. FRANK.
OF COURSE ERNEST.

36:25.500 --> 36:27.750
YOU KNOW THE GUY
SHOT HIMSELF, JO.

36:27.750 --> 36:28.708
ASIDE FROM THAT,

36:28.708 --> 36:32.000
I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER IT
TO YOU AS A--

36:32.000 --> 36:34.625
PLEASE DON'T SAY
"SYMBOL."

36:34.625 --> 36:38.417
AS AN EMBLEMATIC ARTIFACT

36:38.417 --> 36:42.500
REPRESENTING
THE FOUNDATION OF--

36:42.500 --> 36:44.875
OF A NEW FRIENDSHIP.

36:44.875 --> 36:46.875
I FEEL LIKE
I'M AT THE RIBBON-CUTTING
OF A NEW STRIP MALL.

36:46.875 --> 36:50.000
QUIT JOKING.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.166
TRUTH IS, JOEY...

36:52.166 --> 36:54.166
IT'S GONNA TAKE
A HELL OF A LOT
MORE THAN SYMBOLS

36:54.166 --> 36:55.375
FOR US TO GET BACK
WHAT WE HAD,

36:55.375 --> 36:57.834
AND RIGHT NOW
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
THAT I WANT TO.

37:03.875 --> 37:07.041
WE'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO TAKE IT
ONE DAY AT A TIME.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.208
I KNOW.

37:28.583 --> 37:29.834
HEY, DAWSON.
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

37:29.834 --> 37:35.125
THE ANSWER TO THAT
QUESTION EVERYONE'S
BEEN ASKING?

37:35.125 --> 37:37.542
IT WOULDN'T
KILL YOU.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.250
[CLEARS THROAT]

38:13.917 --> 38:15.417
WELL,
I'VE DECIDED SOMETHING,

38:15.417 --> 38:18.125
AND IT IS PERHAPS
THE SINGULARLY
MOST IMPORTANT THING

38:18.125 --> 38:19.959
THAT I'VE REALIZED
IN THE LAST 45 MINUTES,

38:19.959 --> 38:21.333
SO I MUST SHARE IT
WITH YOU.

38:21.333 --> 38:24.083
THIS TOWN HAS
FAR TOO MANY STOPLIGHTS

38:24.083 --> 38:26.542
FOR SOMEBODY
WHO'S NOT VERY GOOD
AT DRIVING STICK.

38:26.542 --> 38:28.667
I STALLED 7 TIMES
COMING OVER HERE.

38:30.959 --> 38:32.375
TOO BAD IT WASN'T 8.

38:36.542 --> 38:42.041
I STALLED 7 TIMES
AND 6 OUT OF THE 7 TIMES,

38:42.041 --> 38:42.417
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT?

38:44.750 --> 38:46.667
YOU.

38:49.542 --> 38:53.625
IT'S THIS SECRET THING I DO
WHENEVER I GET REALLY PISSED OFF

38:53.625 --> 38:56.041
OR CONFUSED OR ANGRY

38:56.041 --> 38:58.834
OR UPSET OR SAD.

38:58.834 --> 39:04.458
I--I THINK OF YOU, AND I
IMMEDIATELY FEEL GOOD INSIDE.

39:04.458 --> 39:07.667
I GUESS
IT'S KIND OF LIKE TAKING
A GOOD MOOD PILL OR SOMETHING.

39:10.917 --> 39:13.625
AND I SWORE TO MYSELF
THAT I WOULD NEVER TELL YOU
THAT I DID THIS,

39:13.625 --> 39:15.708
BECAUSE IT IS
SO GIRLY AND STUPID,

39:15.708 --> 39:19.875
AND I JUST TOLD YOU
BECAUSE...

39:19.875 --> 39:20.875
I NEEDED TO SCORE
MAJOR POINTS

39:20.875 --> 39:25.333
FOR NOT EXPLAINING
WHAT WENT DOWN TONIGHT

39:25.333 --> 39:27.250
OR WHERE I'VE BEEN
THE LAST WEEK

39:27.250 --> 39:28.875
WHEN I HAVEN'T BEEN
ON THIS BOAT.

39:32.667 --> 39:33.667
KEEP GOING.

39:36.583 --> 39:37.542
PACEY...

39:42.375 --> 39:43.917
I WANTED
TO SEE DAWSON TONIGHT

39:43.917 --> 39:47.291
NOT BECAUSE
FOR 4 MONTHS OF MY LIFE
HE WAS MY BOYFRIEND,

39:47.291 --> 39:51.041
BUT BECAUSE FOR
THE BETTER PART OF MY LIFE
HE WAS MY FRIEND.

39:51.041 --> 39:53.500
AND AS MY FRIEND,
I HURT HIM DEEPLY.

39:53.500 --> 39:56.542
LIVING WITH THAT FACT
HAS CAUSED ME

39:56.542 --> 39:59.667
NO SMALL AMOUNT OF GUILT
OVER THE PAST 3 MONTHS.

39:59.667 --> 40:03.375
SO, YES,
I HAVE BEEN PREOCCUPIED,

40:03.375 --> 40:07.166
AND IT HAS
MADE MY MIND WANDER.

40:07.166 --> 40:08.417
BUT...

40:11.208 --> 40:12.417
MY HEART?

40:17.500 --> 40:18.583
THAT'S A FIXED POINT.

40:21.875 --> 40:26.041
3 MONTHS
RIDING THE OPEN WATERS
COULDN'T SHAKE IT,

40:26.041 --> 40:28.583
AND I'LL BE DAMNED
IF I'LL LET YOUR
INSECURITIES SHAKE IT.

40:33.500 --> 40:35.583
MY HEART
NEVER LEFT THIS BOAT.

40:37.083 --> 40:39.583
IT'S NEVER LEFT YOU.

40:41.083 --> 40:44.625
AS FAR AS I CAN SEE,
IT'S NOT GOING TO
ANY TIME SOON.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.708
OK, YOU GOT ME.

40:50.750 --> 40:52.375
I DO WANT TO KNOW
ONE THING, THOUGH.

40:54.667 --> 40:55.166
WHAT'S THAT?

40:55.166 --> 40:57.667
I WANT TO KNOW

40:57.667 --> 40:59.375
WHAT EXACTLY IT WAS
YOU THOUGHT OF

40:59.375 --> 41:02.708
THE SEVENTH TIME
YOU STALLED.

41:02.708 --> 41:05.291
THAT I WAS NEVER
GOING TO DRIVE
STICK AGAIN.

41:06.792 --> 41:08.500
HOW VERY PRACTICAL.

41:19.959 --> 41:22.333
HEY, PACE?

41:22.333 --> 41:23.542
HMM?

41:25.625 --> 41:28.583
DO YOU THINK
WE COULD DO THAT THING
THAT WE DO SOMETIMES?

41:31.417 --> 41:33.875
YOU WANNA
DO THAT THING?

41:37.542 --> 41:37.750
YEAH.

41:44.625 --> 41:47.166
Joey: "THE LITTLE MERMAID
COULD NOT TAKE HER EYES
FROM THE SHIP

41:47.166 --> 41:49.333
"OR FROM
THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCE.

41:49.333 --> 41:51.125
"THE COLORED LANTERNS
HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED.

41:51.125 --> 41:52.834
"NO MORE ROCKETS
ROSE IN THE AIR

41:52.834 --> 41:54.500
"AND THE CANNON
HAD CEASED FIRING.

41:54.500 --> 41:55.458
"BUT THE SEA
BECAME RESTLESS

41:55.458 --> 41:56.542
"AND A MOANING,
GRUMBLING SOUND

41:56.542 --> 41:59.208
COULD BE HEARD
BENEATH THE WAVES."

42:06.667 --> 42:10.208
"AFTER AWHILE, THE SAILS
WERE QUICKLY UNFURLED,

42:10.208 --> 42:12.458
"AND THE NOBLE SHIP
CONTINUED HER PASSAGE,

42:12.458 --> 42:15.375
"BUT SOON THE WAVES
ROSE HIGHER.

42:15.375 --> 42:17.083
"HEAVY CLOUDS
DARKENED THE SKY

42:17.083 --> 42:19.208
"AND LIGHTNING
APPEARED IN THE DISTANCE.

42:19.208 --> 42:21.417
"A DREADFUL STORM
WAS APPROACHING.

42:21.417 --> 42:23.250
"ONCE MORE THE SAILS
WERE REEFED

42:23.250 --> 42:27.208
"AND THE GREAT SHIP
PURSUED HER FLYING COURSE
OVER THE RAGING SEA.

42:27.208 --> 42:30.250
"TO THE LITTLE MERMAID,
THIS APPEARED
PLEASANT SPORT.

42:30.250 --> 42:31.250
NOT SO FOR THE SAILORS."
