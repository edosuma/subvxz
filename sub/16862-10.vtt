00:01.084 --> 00:02.419
<i>Previously on</i> Rescue Me...

00:02.544 --> 00:04.587
I've been a part of
a lot of interventions.

00:04.587 --> 00:06.047
Okay? They're never easy.

00:06.047 --> 00:08.550
Some people get extremely
defensive and even violent.

00:08.550 --> 00:09.759
Shit!

00:09.759 --> 00:12.303
I can't go back to rehab!
It doesn't work for me!

00:12.303 --> 00:16.433
I mean, shit, we got enough drunks in
this room to start our own meetings.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.893
Sheila gave us half
a million bucks, okay?

00:18.893 --> 00:20.437
- What?
- You never wanted that baby.

00:20.437 --> 00:23.189
- Don't you put it back on me.
- You're crazy. You sold my baby!

00:23.189 --> 00:25.734
You're the one who told me
to go see her. Okay?

00:25.734 --> 00:27.610
We just agreed honesty's
the best policy, right?

00:27.736 --> 00:28.945
I was wrong.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.613
- Baby, don't.
- No, no, no.

00:30.613 --> 00:32.449
I am not your baby anymore.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.953
I'm gonna take a long walk.
You be gone when I get back.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.455
Hey.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.042
Oh, wow. Ah.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.127
You don't think I'm being
too forward, do you?

00:44.252 --> 00:46.629
No, no. I'd have to be
insane to think that.

00:46.629 --> 00:48.214
And you want me, don't you?

00:48.214 --> 00:50.675
Yeah, yeah. Oh. Wow. Cool.

00:51.217 --> 00:52.844
- Hi.
- Hi, Auntie Sheila.

00:52.844 --> 00:55.847
My dad and me, we wanted
to see how the baby was doing.

00:55.847 --> 00:58.141
Oh, say hi to
your sister. Yeah.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.976
Okay, I'm gonna
be right back.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.273
In the car. In the car.
In the car, sweetie.

01:05.273 --> 01:07.442
Close the door. Close the door.
Good, good, good. Okay.

01:07.442 --> 01:09.319
- Oh, shit!
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:09.319 --> 01:11.821
No! What are you doing?

01:12.322 --> 01:14.365
He hates you!

01:14.657 --> 01:16.493
He hates you!

01:18.203 --> 01:20.955
Eh, I mean, I don't feel
connected to this God at all.

01:20.955 --> 01:23.416
I don't even know what kind
of point system the guy's using.

01:23.416 --> 01:24.667
I tell you one thing,

01:24.667 --> 01:27.170
I'm sure as hell glad
he ain't my bookie.

01:27.670 --> 01:28.671
Ew.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.006
- What the--
- Cockroach.

01:30.131 --> 01:31.883
All right, guys.

01:32.008 --> 01:34.219
Let's just settle down,
try and focus. Okay?

01:34.344 --> 01:38.348
The topic we're gonna talk about
is the higher power, all right?

01:38.473 --> 01:41.101
God or whatever
your higher power might be.

01:41.101 --> 01:44.896
You know, how you see him,
or her, or it.

01:45.021 --> 01:47.524
Yeah, well, I-I for one
am one of those, um,

01:47.774 --> 01:49.109
uh... what do you call it?

01:49.109 --> 01:50.819
- Agnostics.
- Yeah.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.070
- You don't believe in God.
- No.

01:52.195 --> 01:55.073
- Typical.
- Oh, yeah, like you do, right?

01:55.198 --> 01:56.199
I do now.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.408
If you don't believe in God,

01:57.534 --> 01:59.369
how can you remotely hope
to stay sober, huh?

01:59.369 --> 02:02.372
Well, Tommy hasn't had
a drink in, like, what?

02:02.497 --> 02:04.332
Eleven months, four weeks
and two days.

02:04.332 --> 02:06.584
Two hundred and forty-three
minutes, 12 seconds.

02:06.835 --> 02:07.836
Hey, asshole.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.588
You're really trying to tell me
that God is helping keep him sober?

02:10.588 --> 02:13.216
- I don't think so, sweetheart.
- He's white-knuckling it.

02:13.341 --> 02:14.551
Sorry, Tom, it's true.

02:14.801 --> 02:18.471
If you can't find your way to some
sort of faith-based foundation here,

02:18.471 --> 02:19.597
you're doomed to fail.

02:19.848 --> 02:22.267
- I really think she's right.
- Thank you.

02:22.392 --> 02:25.186
Oh, don't listen to her. She still goes
to 9:00 mass every Sunday.

02:25.395 --> 02:26.771
Yeah, so what?

02:26.896 --> 02:28.398
Okay, guys, the truth
of the matter is

02:28.398 --> 02:31.568
if you don't believe in some form
of higher power, trust in something

02:31.693 --> 02:34.696
bigger than yourself,
you're gonna wind up counting days.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.990
I mean, believe me.
I was a priest, okay?

02:36.990 --> 02:40.285
I find more God in these
rooms, even in this room,

02:40.410 --> 02:42.620
than I ever did when I was
working for the church.

02:42.745 --> 02:44.539
- You know?
- Hey, Sean.

02:44.539 --> 02:48.501
T-the ability to share
y-your sins with other sinners,

02:48.501 --> 02:50.378
that's what's
gonna get you through.

02:50.378 --> 02:53.423
Even if, let's say, two minutes
after we walk out of this apartment, okay,

02:53.548 --> 02:55.842
Tommy goes into the kitchen,
opens up a kitchen cabinet,

02:55.842 --> 02:58.136
finds a brand-spanking-new
bottle of Maker's Mark,

02:58.386 --> 03:00.555
if he has faith and trust,
he won't drink it.

03:00.555 --> 03:02.015
Holy shit.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.349
- What?
- There's a bottle

03:03.349 --> 03:05.894
of Maker's Mark
in one of these cabinets?

03:05.894 --> 03:07.395
Ow! Goddamn it.

03:07.395 --> 03:08.688
I...

03:08.688 --> 03:11.482
Sean--
Sean, why is your hand up?

03:11.608 --> 03:13.568
Well, I have something
that I-I'd like to share.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.445
Uh, okay, Sean.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.363
Okay, um, God, for me--

03:17.363 --> 03:20.408
- Yeah.
- He, uh-- He's a, you know--

03:20.408 --> 03:26.122
He's just this huge,
uh, kind of all-powerful, enormous...

03:27.957 --> 03:29.751
cloud.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.002
- God is a cloud?
- Yeah, well,

03:31.127 --> 03:32.629
I'm not finished yet, Maggie.

03:32.754 --> 03:38.134
He's, you know,
this giant cloud of pink gas.

03:39.302 --> 03:42.347
Oh, wow. That's--
Okay, I didn't realize that there

03:42.472 --> 03:43.765
was going to be
judgment happening.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.099
Why is he here?
Why is he here?

03:45.099 --> 03:46.184
I thought I was in--

03:46.434 --> 03:48.061
No, no. He is not an alcoholic.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.437
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not!

03:49.437 --> 03:51.397
- Yes, I am.
- Prove it!

03:51.397 --> 03:53.900
- Prove it? I'm here. I--
- Listen, Pinky.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.401
How many drinks
you have a day?

03:55.401 --> 03:57.111
Depends on the occasion, really.

03:57.111 --> 03:59.155
- Give us a ballpark.
- Such a liar.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.199
Five, eight, 12 drinks a day?

04:01.449 --> 04:04.202
- Well, 12 is a lot.
- This guy ain't no souse.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.495
Guys--
You-- I--

04:05.620 --> 04:08.998
Who votes that Sean does not
get to come to these meetings any more?

04:09.123 --> 04:11.167
- Whoa. Hold on.
- Well, you know what,

04:11.167 --> 04:12.919
who votes that I get to stay?

04:12.919 --> 04:14.879
You know, I only drink
a little bit myself.

04:15.004 --> 04:16.839
Yeah, here's
the denial talking now.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.091
Total denial right here.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.009
- Hey, asshole.
- Guys, please.

04:20.134 --> 04:21.511
I'm trying to chair this meeting.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.680
I'm going to look for that bottle.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.682
You know, when are you going
to face the facts?

04:25.682 --> 04:27.684
What, you're gonna
start drinking again?

04:27.809 --> 04:29.435
- You know what?
- Guys, guys, please.

04:29.435 --> 04:32.689
There's another rat.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.399
I-it's just a mouse, okay?

04:34.524 --> 04:37.110
It's just a mouse, don't worry.
Can you guys, please--

04:38.695 --> 04:41.698
This place is as dry
as a goddamn bone.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.075
Booze.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.202
Go find booze.

04:52.875 --> 04:55.545
<i>On another day
C'mon, c'mon</i>

04:55.545 --> 04:59.424
<i>With these ropes tied tight
Can we do no wrong?</i>

04:59.549 --> 05:02.093
<i>Now we grieve
'Cause now it's gone</i>

05:02.218 --> 05:05.221
<i>Things were good
When we were young</i>

05:05.471 --> 05:08.933
<i>When my teeth bite down
I can see the blood</i>

05:09.058 --> 05:11.728
<i>Of a thousand men
Who have come and gone</i>

05:11.853 --> 05:15.481
<i>Now we grieve
'Cause now it's gone</i>

05:15.481 --> 05:18.109
<i>Things were good
When we were young</i>

05:18.234 --> 05:21.863
<i>Is it safe to stay?
C'mon, c'mon</i>

05:21.863 --> 05:24.949
<i>Was it right to leave?
C'mon, c'mon</i>

05:25.074 --> 05:28.703
<i>Will I ever learn?
C'mon, c'mon</i>

05:28.703 --> 05:31.748
<i>C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon</i>

05:37.712 --> 05:40.757
I'll have the chicken
and I'll have the waffles.

05:40.757 --> 05:43.259
Heavy on the chicken,
heavy on the waffles

05:43.509 --> 05:46.763
and, uh, why don't you give me
a fruit salad for my conscience.

05:46.763 --> 05:47.847
You got it, sugar.

05:47.847 --> 05:50.516
I'll have the same.
Uh, hold the fruit.

05:50.516 --> 05:51.934
Thank you.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.813
All right. Heh-heh.

05:56.314 --> 05:59.025
Whoo, how about some fries
with that shake?

05:59.025 --> 06:01.694
Hey, Mike, would you please
not make a correlation

06:01.694 --> 06:03.196
between food
and that woman's ass?

06:03.196 --> 06:05.365
You're going
to ruin my appetite.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.786
I'm gonna go get her number.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.120
Are you kidding me?

06:29.639 --> 06:31.307
Hey.

06:31.432 --> 06:32.934
- Dad?
- How you doing?

06:32.934 --> 06:34.644
Why--
Why do you have the baby?

06:34.644 --> 06:37.647
Um, I made a deal with Mom.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.273
You want to help me out?

06:39.273 --> 06:40.400
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

06:40.566 --> 06:43.319
A deal with Mom-- Uh, Jesus.

06:44.487 --> 06:47.448
Whew. Where'd you get this car?
From Cheech and Chong?

06:49.700 --> 06:52.120
So, what's the deal? I--

06:52.120 --> 06:54.247
I have him three days a week.

06:56.207 --> 06:57.250
Me and Tony, okay?

06:57.375 --> 07:00.837
Mom's paying us a babysitting fee
and besides that, it's good for me.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.130
You know, practice and stuff.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.549
It's pra--
Heh. Whoa, whoa.

07:04.674 --> 07:05.967
What do you mean "practice"?

07:05.967 --> 07:09.595
Please don't tell me you're thinking
about having a baby with-- With-- Hi.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.556
The guy who owns this piece of crap?

07:11.681 --> 07:14.559
- Are you crazy?
- Okay, I don't have time for this.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.686
You don't h--
Okay, explain to me

07:16.811 --> 07:19.355
why your mother doesn't have
the baby full-time.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.940
Please.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.860
Colleen?

07:23.985 --> 07:25.570
Coll--

07:26.946 --> 07:28.364
Wha-- What is this?

07:28.364 --> 07:30.575
Tony had three out-of-town
gigs this week.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.201
Okay, you know what?

07:32.326 --> 07:34.579
Did you get some
new tattoo on your ass?

07:34.704 --> 07:36.205
What's this?

07:36.205 --> 07:39.000
It's the bass player's.
Don't worry about it, okay?

07:39.125 --> 07:41.210
I'm taking that baby
out of this car.

07:41.335 --> 07:42.336
No, you're not!

07:42.336 --> 07:44.255
Yes, I'm taking that baby
out of this car.

07:44.380 --> 07:46.257
Stop it! No, no, Dad.
Just stop it!

07:46.382 --> 07:48.759
Colleen.

07:48.885 --> 07:51.679
Don't you start that car.
No-- Ah, wait, wait, wait.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.265
Okay, you know what?

07:54.390 --> 07:55.892
I'll make a deal with you, okay?

07:55.892 --> 07:58.186
If you promise not to drive
the baby in this car any more,

07:58.186 --> 08:01.230
I'll give you a brand-new
credit card, how about that?

08:01.355 --> 08:05.109
- For what?
- For not driving the baby

08:05.234 --> 08:06.819
and you give me, um--

08:06.819 --> 08:09.906
Tell me where Mom is and, um--

08:10.031 --> 08:11.157
'Cause I need to talk to her.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.992
A-and you let me have the baby,

08:12.992 --> 08:15.203
eh, a couple days a week
without her knowing about it.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.496
- What?
- I don't think so.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.122
Uh, okay. You know--
Ha-ha.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.833
All right?

08:20.833 --> 08:22.627
How about that?

08:22.752 --> 08:25.046
All right? You can charge
as much as you want.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.672
My name's already on here, Dad.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.633
Yeah, because
I was anticipating, all right?

08:28.758 --> 08:30.092
- I was thinking ahead.
- No deal, okay?

08:30.092 --> 08:31.761
You were going to give
this to me anyway.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.763
You know what? Listen to me.
Because I love you.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.765
Because I'm, like,
the Wayne Gretsky of dads,

08:35.765 --> 08:37.475
- I was anticipating that--
- Bye!

08:37.725 --> 08:39.393
Wait, no.
Turn the car off, please.

08:41.312 --> 08:42.772
Jesus Christ.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.690
All right.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.984
If you promise not to drive
the baby in the car any more

08:47.193 --> 08:48.778
and the other stuff,
I'll give you a--

08:48.778 --> 08:50.613
I'll give you a brand-new car.

08:50.613 --> 08:53.115
Not brand-new, but I'll get you
something better than this.

08:53.115 --> 08:55.826
- Now we're talking.
- Okay? Please?

09:01.332 --> 09:03.626
So...

09:03.626 --> 09:05.628
Mom-wise...

09:05.628 --> 09:06.837
I want a Porsche.

09:06.837 --> 09:09.590
You are such a goddamn Gavin
it's not even funny.

09:09.715 --> 09:12.426
- I am not getting you a Porsche.
- Okay, a BMW, then.

09:12.426 --> 09:14.220
I'll tell you
who she's sleeping with.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.680
Okay, just a little info.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.266
Who she's sleeping with now
is worth maybe--

09:18.266 --> 09:20.977
Maybe at the outside a five-
or six-year-old Jeep Cherokee.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.271
Okay, unless she's sleeping
with somebody I know

09:23.271 --> 09:25.314
or, you know,
a female relative.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.316
Then, maybe,
you'd get a used BMW.

09:28.484 --> 09:30.361
Yeah, okay,
that's what I thought.

09:30.486 --> 09:32.655
Jeep Cherokee. Spill.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.532
She's sleeping
with her new boss.

09:34.532 --> 09:37.159
He runs a real estate company.
His name is Bob.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.953
Such a clich.

09:38.953 --> 09:44.333
Short, bald, uh,
fat Jewish guy, right?

09:44.458 --> 09:45.751
- Mm-mm.
- How old is he?

09:45.751 --> 09:46.836
Thirty-three.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.756
All right,

09:50.756 --> 09:52.675
listen, that card--

09:52.800 --> 09:55.344
Um, it's-- You can charge
as much as you want.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.597
I want you to use it
for what you need, all right?

09:57.722 --> 09:59.765
Need would mean
anything for the baby.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.684
You know, whatever you--

10:01.809 --> 10:04.395
- Birth control would be on the need list.
- Okay.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.688
Not stuff that you want.

10:05.813 --> 10:08.357
Stuff that you want, you know,
would be pretty much anything

10:08.482 --> 10:09.775
your boyfriend says he needs.

10:09.775 --> 10:10.901
- All right?
- Okay.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.528
- Okay, I love you.
- Love you too. Mwah.

10:12.528 --> 10:13.779
Okay. Bye.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.865
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.366
All right.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.124
Hi, Franco.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.544
Hey. Hey, Rich.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.379
Is everything okay?

10:30.379 --> 10:31.505
Yeah.

10:32.673 --> 10:34.008
Is Nat all right?

10:34.008 --> 10:35.885
She cries sometimes.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.137
Oh, yeah?

10:38.387 --> 10:39.889
Well, she's not the only one.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.515
So, what's up?

10:43.059 --> 10:44.060
She, uh--

10:46.062 --> 10:47.104
What is it, Rich?

10:48.272 --> 10:50.024
Hey, it's all right,
man, you know?

10:50.149 --> 10:51.984
Whatever it is,
you can tell me.

10:51.984 --> 10:53.611
She has a new boyfriend.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.697
We just broke up
four goddamn days ago, Richie.

10:56.697 --> 10:58.908
Don't--
Oh, this is bullshit, man.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.534
They work together.

11:00.534 --> 11:03.412
Oh, they work together.
Oh, that's classic.

11:03.537 --> 11:06.207
We break up four days ago.
All the history between us.

11:06.415 --> 11:07.917
A goddamn marriage proposal

11:07.917 --> 11:11.379
and she's already latched on
to some asshole from her office?

11:11.379 --> 11:14.215
Next time they have a date
I can show you where.

11:14.423 --> 11:16.175
You'd do that for me, Rich?

11:17.093 --> 11:18.177
I like you better.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.429
Thanks, man.

11:20.888 --> 11:23.224
H-hey, listen, I'm--
I'm sorry, all right?

11:23.349 --> 11:25.434
I'm sorry for, like,
losing it on you.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.937
Okay, that was--
That was way immature.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.481
You shouldn't do shit
like that to people, okay?

11:30.606 --> 11:31.607
That's okay.

11:31.732 --> 11:33.442
All right.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.736
Now, listen,
go find out when and where

11:35.736 --> 11:38.197
that next date is taking place
so we can spy on your sister.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.740
Okay.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.494
You're like the brother
I never had, Franco.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.789
I love you.

11:47.665 --> 11:48.833
Hey, man.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.050
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna get back to work.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.468
Okay.

12:05.307 --> 12:07.476
Hey, you guys.

12:07.601 --> 12:09.478
You guys hear
about Bobby the Beast?

12:09.478 --> 12:10.855
- What?
- 65 Truck.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.983
Once ate 14 cheeseburgers
and drank 17 beers

12:13.983 --> 12:17.069
at 65 Truck's fourth of July
barbeque without puking.

12:17.069 --> 12:18.529
Thus the nickname.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.656
Crazy bastard tried
to save some broad

12:20.781 --> 12:23.743
who was already dead by using
himself as a battering ram.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.494
Hey, guys.
What do we got?

12:25.494 --> 12:26.620
Chicken Cordon Lou.

12:26.620 --> 12:27.705
Oh, my God, my favorite.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.498
Yeah.
Oh, wow.

12:29.623 --> 12:31.709
As I was saying,
he broke through a wall,

12:31.834 --> 12:34.462
broke his shoulder, they found
the two of them all burned up.

12:34.462 --> 12:37.465
Two guys on his crew got
burned trying to pull him out.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.175
I was a chief over there.

12:39.175 --> 12:40.468
<i>- Meshugeneh.</i>
- Yeah.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.721
This is the crazy shit I was
trying to talk to you about, Gavin.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.390
Wow, it makes you think,
you know, about God.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.058
Hey, pass the corn, will you?

12:48.184 --> 12:49.518
What are we,
shirts and skins?

12:49.643 --> 12:50.895
Yeah, apparently.

12:51.020 --> 12:55.065
Wow, the mayor's finally up in arms
about the racial situation in the F.D.N.Y.

12:55.191 --> 12:58.903
Says here once again only
two percent of the new class

12:59.028 --> 13:02.698
entering probie school are made
up of African-Americans. Shit.

13:02.823 --> 13:04.825
I was the only brother
I saw when I walked through.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.327
I was the only Jew
when I went through.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.162
Mm.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.747
I could tell you,
you can count on, uh,

13:09.872 --> 13:12.833
one hand the number of Jews
in the department right now.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.543
Heh, you Irish.

13:14.668 --> 13:17.546
You got a lock on this job.

13:17.546 --> 13:18.798
"You Irish"?

13:20.174 --> 13:21.759
- That's what I said.
- Yeah.

13:21.759 --> 13:24.261
Like w-we take a different exam
than you took?

13:24.261 --> 13:26.639
He's not saying that.
Come on, let's be real.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.809
Most of the guys down at HQ
and the academy, what are they?

13:29.809 --> 13:31.352
Irish and Italian. Catholic.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.687
And they're the ones
who check off the grades

13:33.687 --> 13:36.690
and decide who makes it in
just to take the physical exam,

13:36.690 --> 13:38.108
and who grades
the written exam?

13:38.234 --> 13:41.529
Probably the same guys.
I'm just saying. You know what I mean?

13:41.529 --> 13:42.822
- Word.
- Yeah, so what,

13:42.822 --> 13:44.865
now it's a, heh, goddamn plot?

13:44.865 --> 13:46.575
Sean's got a point, you know?

13:46.575 --> 13:47.743
- Talk to him.
- Which is?

13:47.743 --> 13:49.245
Well, you know,
we talked about it,

13:49.245 --> 13:51.080
like a million times
Puerto Rican-wise.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.249
What percentage do we count
for in the department?

13:53.249 --> 13:55.042
- Like, eight?
- Yeah, it's better than two.

13:55.042 --> 13:58.462
Uh-huh. Tell you what,
you guys want to go deep on this bullshit,

13:58.462 --> 14:00.506
I got you by
the goddamn balls, okay?

14:01.006 --> 14:02.842
You know how many
African-Americans

14:02.967 --> 14:05.344
I've saved in the course
of my career? Huh?

14:05.594 --> 14:08.597
I'll tell you how many.
I don't have a goddamn clue.

14:08.597 --> 14:12.101
I never pulled up,
jumped off the rig and asked, "Who," okay?

14:12.226 --> 14:14.186
Homeless, rich, drunk, high,

14:14.186 --> 14:17.022
or just plain goddamn stupid,
I didn't give a shit.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.899
You know,
you ever think that maybe

14:18.899 --> 14:22.111
the reason there ain't
more Chinese and female

14:22.236 --> 14:23.904
and black firefighters is 'cause

14:23.904 --> 14:26.615
maybe they just don't
want the goddamn job.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.117
Huh?

14:29.243 --> 14:30.995
'Cause it ain't a job.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.705
It's a curse.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.957
We get into it because
we want to make a difference.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.251
And in a house like this,
you start making a difference

14:37.251 --> 14:39.253
right away, right?
You know that, huh?

14:39.253 --> 14:40.963
From the first night,
you go out on what?

14:40.963 --> 14:42.298
Six, seven calls a night?

14:42.298 --> 14:44.258
You start pulling them out
one by one, two by two,

14:44.258 --> 14:46.802
all of a sudden you're, like,
goddamn Noah, huh?

14:46.802 --> 14:49.054
You're pulling out, uh,
tiny little Chinks,

14:49.054 --> 14:52.641
and sweaty spics,
and lazy ass raisin heads,

14:52.641 --> 14:55.644
and drunken Irish micks and
name the stereotype, we got it.

14:55.769 --> 14:57.730
We pulled them out.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.441
Meanwhile, what's going on with
your family back home, right?

15:00.649 --> 15:02.610
Nothing.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.487
You're too busy saving
utter and complete strangers.

15:05.487 --> 15:08.198
You treat your family like
they're in the back seat.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.575
Heh.

15:10.534 --> 15:12.411
And God? Heh.

15:12.661 --> 15:15.414
There ain't enough God
to go around in this job, boys.

15:17.666 --> 15:18.667
So...

15:19.335 --> 15:20.794
ultimately,

15:22.212 --> 15:23.839
what are you left with?

15:23.964 --> 15:26.050
You get a couple medals on your chest.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.635
I don't even take those.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.845
All I got is that scar on my hip,

15:30.846 --> 15:33.098
a scar on my ass

15:33.474 --> 15:36.477
and all the shit
that's bottled up in my head.

15:37.853 --> 15:39.647
Yep.

15:39.980 --> 15:44.276
Food, fire, and sex.

15:44.693 --> 15:47.696
That's pretty much all I got boys.

15:47.696 --> 15:50.950
Maybe time for a nap in between.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.370
You know, those nine guys
that gave their lives

15:54.495 --> 15:56.789
in the line of duty
down at Charleston City?

15:56.789 --> 16:00.459
I don't even care
what color those guys were

16:01.001 --> 16:05.130
because they were all
goddamn heroes to me.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.097
Anybody else notice
that he never mentioned

16:13.222 --> 16:15.224
kikes in the middle
of that speech?

16:15.432 --> 16:17.851
I was too busy wondering if he
was going to eat the damn dish.

16:29.738 --> 16:35.077
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

16:35.202 --> 16:38.414
Blessed art thou
amongst women,

16:38.414 --> 16:41.917
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

16:48.882 --> 16:51.927
Twelve years of Catholic school
and you can't remember

16:51.927 --> 16:53.595
the shortest
prayer they wrote.

16:55.597 --> 16:58.600
I wish there was
a nun here right now.

16:59.935 --> 17:01.270
Sister Agnes Catherine.

17:02.938 --> 17:06.150
She'd kick your skinny
little Irish ass real good.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.622
Hey, there. Good morning.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.750
Hi. How's it, uh--
How's it going?

17:22.750 --> 17:24.460
Fine.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.796
You, um, must be the, uh--
The waitress from that, uh--

17:27.796 --> 17:31.550
The soul food place, right?
A friend of my cousin Mike's?

17:31.550 --> 17:34.636
- Latrina.
- Latrina. Lovely.

17:34.762 --> 17:37.181
- Ah, Ken.
- You take it black.

17:37.306 --> 17:40.642
No, uh--
Yes I, uh, I do.

17:40.768 --> 17:43.020
It's a lactose
kind of a mucous--

17:43.020 --> 17:45.397
Not me, I like a little
cream in my coffee,

17:45.522 --> 17:48.025
if you know what I mean.
You got any?

17:48.150 --> 17:50.069
Yeah, I think, uh--
I think we do.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.987
It should be on
the top shelf there.

17:51.987 --> 17:54.656
So I, um--
I really should get going.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.492
You may want
to stick around for a bit.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.077
I make a whale of an omelet.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.580
Oh, yeah, I bet you do
but I can't, uh-- I can't be late.

18:02.664 --> 18:03.999
- Your loss.
- Okay.

18:04.124 --> 18:06.502
- Have a good day.
- Yeah. Excuse me.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.087
Have a good omelet.

18:15.219 --> 18:16.720
Come on.

18:19.139 --> 18:21.725
Hey, doesn't that look like the car
we pancaked the other day?

18:21.725 --> 18:24.228
- This thing's built like a tank.
- Yeah, the Germans.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.396
- They're nuts about safety.
- What's the big deal?

18:26.522 --> 18:28.649
They got airbags
or something in there?

18:28.649 --> 18:30.067
There's airbags
all around in there.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.152
It's like Mariah Carey
meets Anna Nicole Smith.

18:32.152 --> 18:34.154
They should put a nipple
on the inside of each door

18:34.154 --> 18:35.239
and be done with it.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.407
Gentlemen, we have a lovely
little knickknack shop

18:37.533 --> 18:39.993
that the owner probably torched
for the insurance cabbage.

18:39.993 --> 18:41.453
Tommy, you and Lou
go in the front.

18:41.453 --> 18:44.206
You guys grab black Sean
and head around the back, all right?

18:44.331 --> 18:45.332
You got it.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.709
I got a little problem, pal.

18:47.709 --> 18:49.044
- Which is?
- Hey, Joey the Jig.

18:49.044 --> 18:50.170
- Hey, Lou.
- Hey.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.422
Remember how I caught my
cousin Mike banging Theresa?

18:52.548 --> 18:53.966
Yeah. Joey, see you later.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.884
Well, you know he's, like,
my favorite relative.

18:55.884 --> 18:58.053
I mean, he's more like
a brother than he is a cousin.

18:58.053 --> 18:59.763
Not to mention the fact
that he gave me an out

18:59.763 --> 19:02.182
from a relationship that
otherwise probably would have

19:02.182 --> 19:03.600
have meant
my sex-related demise.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.769
Because we're so close,
I'm figuring you know what?

19:05.769 --> 19:07.187
I'm just gonna swallow it.

19:07.187 --> 19:09.231
You know, let it be.
Let bygones be bygones.

19:09.231 --> 19:12.317
The thing is, he's kind of
banging this waitress now,

19:12.317 --> 19:15.320
and I think it might be, like,
you know, a regular thing.

19:15.487 --> 19:16.488
What?

19:16.488 --> 19:17.823
- Revenge sex.
- No.

19:17.948 --> 19:19.992
You're thinking
of having revenge sex.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.743
Oh, you're going to lie
to me about that now?

19:21.869 --> 19:23.412
If I'm thinking about
having revenge sex,

19:23.579 --> 19:24.580
may God strike me down now.

19:24.580 --> 19:25.831
What you pushing me for?

19:25.831 --> 19:27.833
Okay. All right.
Well, look. You know what?

19:27.833 --> 19:30.711
Why shouldn't I?
Tit for tat.

19:30.711 --> 19:33.172
Screw unto others
as they have screwed unto you.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.298
Hey.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.091
Plus, Theresa was my girl,
all right?

19:36.091 --> 19:38.969
And he crossed the definite,
unwritten, unspoken, invisible line.

19:39.094 --> 19:40.262
Smitty! Hey, Smits, what's up?

19:40.387 --> 19:43.265
Listen, no question,
he broke the rule

19:43.390 --> 19:44.766
that no man shall break, all right?

19:44.892 --> 19:47.561
When it comes to ex-girlfriends,
we all know the rule, right?

19:47.561 --> 19:50.355
Until the day she dies
or you die, anybody, even me,

19:50.355 --> 19:52.232
if I saw her across
the street and I said hello

19:52.357 --> 19:54.276
but I wanted to cross
and say something else,

19:54.276 --> 19:55.986
I've gotta have
your permission in advance.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.237
Right, thank you,

19:57.237 --> 19:59.072
because that is exactly
what I am thinking.

19:59.072 --> 20:01.116
- I know. Hey. How you doing?
- Hey, Handsome Jack.

20:01.116 --> 20:02.951
Hey. Lieutenant,
how you doing?

20:02.951 --> 20:04.828
- Good to see you. pal.
- Hey, how are you pal.

20:04.828 --> 20:05.913
Tommy,
it's good to see you.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.456
Good to see you, man.

20:08.457 --> 20:09.958
Did he have more work done?

20:09.958 --> 20:11.627
Yeah, he had a couple
more skin grafts done

20:11.752 --> 20:13.879
and I think the last one they
took a piece from his rear end

20:13.879 --> 20:15.047
and attached it to his face.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.215
So when he says kiss my ass--

20:16.215 --> 20:17.674
Yeah, he really means it.

20:17.799 --> 20:19.927
I think you should go ahead
and make the move.

20:19.927 --> 20:22.012
You know, come on, life's
too short. Look at him.

20:22.137 --> 20:23.430
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I mean,

20:23.430 --> 20:24.640
while you've got your looks.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.142
That's what I'm thinking.
There's only one problem though.

20:27.142 --> 20:28.518
- Which is what?
- Well, she's black.

20:28.518 --> 20:30.854
Ooh. Are we talking
Halle Berry black,

20:30.854 --> 20:32.231
or, like,
Jennifer Hudson black?

20:32.231 --> 20:33.315
Aretha Franklin black.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.816
- Now, understand--
- Oh, holy shit.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.151
It's nothing
against black women.

20:36.151 --> 20:37.986
I they happen to be very,
very beautiful.

20:38.111 --> 20:39.571
It's not a racial thing at all.

20:39.571 --> 20:41.323
No, no, no. I mean,
nobody's talking about

20:41.323 --> 20:42.741
anybody's skin color or anything.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.534
- Exactly.
- Let me ask you this.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.620
- Can she sing?
- How the hell do I know?

20:46.620 --> 20:48.664
Well, I'm just asking
because sometimes talent

20:48.789 --> 20:50.832
in one area can overcome
or take the edge off

20:51.083 --> 20:52.376
a lack of talent
in the other area.

20:52.501 --> 20:53.961
Did I also mention
that she's fat?

20:53.961 --> 20:55.045
- Oh, she's fat.
- Yeah.

20:55.170 --> 20:56.546
How fat?

20:56.672 --> 20:58.257
I mean, she'd have
to be able to sing,

20:58.257 --> 21:00.842
dance, paint and figure skate
to take the edge off

21:01.093 --> 21:02.844
and even then there'd
be a lot of edge left.

21:03.053 --> 21:06.181
Okay, well you know what?
You'd have to be psychologically damaged

21:06.306 --> 21:08.517
or, you know, maybe even
have a dent in your head

21:08.517 --> 21:11.186
to even think about possibly
having sex with somebody

21:11.311 --> 21:12.854
under those particular circumstances.

21:12.854 --> 21:15.357
- You think?
- Yeah, I think so.

21:17.317 --> 21:19.236
I'm thinking
the sooner the better.

21:19.361 --> 21:21.113
- Yeah, maybe tomorrow.
- You know what I mean?

21:21.113 --> 21:23.365
- Really get right back at him.
- Hey guys.

21:23.490 --> 21:24.533
- Hey.
- Hey guys.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.076
Check it out.
Look what Sean found.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.578
Antique lamp, totally untouched
by the fire or the smoke.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.580
- What?
- All right, three things.

21:30.706 --> 21:34.251
This is private property,
which means it belongs to someone,

21:34.376 --> 21:36.670
which means it has memories
and emotions attached to it.

21:36.670 --> 21:38.297
Could possibly
be a family heirloom.

21:38.297 --> 21:41.258
Okay, second, taking
private property from the scene

21:41.383 --> 21:43.593
of a fire, damaged or not, okay,

21:43.719 --> 21:45.387
is against, uh,
department regulations.

21:45.512 --> 21:46.722
Hm.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.598
What's the Third thing, Lou?

21:48.724 --> 21:51.184
It looks like the reading
lamp, uh, from a bedside table.

21:51.184 --> 21:52.811
Which means there's
probably another one

21:52.811 --> 21:54.396
exactly like it, lying around.

21:54.521 --> 21:56.398
If you can find that
and bring it directly to me,

21:56.523 --> 21:58.275
- I'd appreciate it. Thank you.
- Aha.

21:58.275 --> 21:59.985
You know, that's going to look

22:00.110 --> 22:02.195
real nice with that headboard
you got out of the furniture

22:02.195 --> 22:04.823
warehouse fire last week.
It's the fun side of arson.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.491
And by the way,
Feinberg's been making

22:06.491 --> 22:07.951
a lot of noises
about you lately.

22:07.951 --> 22:10.412
- Okay, what kind of noises?
- Like, transfer noises.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.456
I mean,
the guy thinks you're a nut,

22:12.581 --> 22:14.875
he thinks you're unstable,
we all know that. Blah, blah, blah.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.169
But what he's really pissed
at is the whole daughter

22:17.169 --> 22:18.462
not getting touched thing.

22:18.462 --> 22:20.297
Okay, how many times
do I have to say it?

22:20.297 --> 22:22.549
The daughter is completely--
She's completely insane.

22:22.549 --> 22:23.967
she's completely crazy. Yes.

22:24.092 --> 22:26.178
But, Tommy, it's a problem
we can easily fix.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.888
- How?
- You take her out one more time.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.931
Okay? You pour, like,
two or three drinks

22:29.931 --> 22:31.308
in her and y-you cop a feel.

22:31.308 --> 22:33.727
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Cop a feel?

22:33.727 --> 22:36.772
You give her a little kiss here,
a little kiss there, a little squeezy,

22:36.772 --> 22:38.774
squeezy, squeezy and a little
tit action, you know,

22:38.899 --> 22:41.568
you feel her up a little bit,
bing, bang, boom. Done deal.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.070
Bing, bang, boom?

22:43.070 --> 22:44.821
Look, I meant that metaphor--
You know--

22:44.946 --> 22:48.325
More in the lines of, like,
dropping her home than sexual intercourse.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.494
Oh, okay, okay, okay.
Now, define "a little",

22:50.619 --> 22:51.745
when it comes to, you know--

22:51.745 --> 22:54.790
I'm talking about, you know,
a little finger action.

22:54.915 --> 22:55.957
Finger action?

22:55.957 --> 22:57.292
Well, what do you want
me to say?

22:57.417 --> 22:58.585
- Third base, okay?
- Well--

22:58.794 --> 23:00.796
- You want to get transferred?
- No.

23:00.796 --> 23:02.798
Then use your head and use
your fingers a little bit.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.299
Okay, okay, okay.

23:04.299 --> 23:05.634
Hey guys, look what I found.

23:05.842 --> 23:09.429
Hey, present from
me to you, Jack.

23:09.429 --> 23:10.597
Thanks, Lou.

23:10.806 --> 23:12.641
- You're welcome.
- All right, pal.

23:12.849 --> 23:15.018
Oh, Christ, are you
sure that's his ass

23:15.143 --> 23:16.937
because there's a part
of his chin right here

23:16.937 --> 23:18.814
that looks a little bit like--

23:18.814 --> 23:20.774
- Scrotum.
- Scrotum, I know, I know.

23:20.774 --> 23:22.359
See the thing is,
I don't like to think

23:22.359 --> 23:23.902
of it that way
because it's too creepy.

23:23.902 --> 23:25.987
So, what I like to do
is imagine that they grafted

23:25.987 --> 23:27.656
some other part
of his body over there.

23:27.656 --> 23:29.449
- Elbow.
- Elbow? That's what we'll do.

23:29.449 --> 23:30.534
Elbow skin.
Elbow skin.

23:30.659 --> 23:31.660
That's what it looks like.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.036
- By the way, Elbow Skin...
- Yeah.

23:33.161 --> 23:34.162
Not a bad name for a band.

23:34.162 --> 23:35.497
I think it is the name of a band.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.165
That is a keeper
if I've ever seen one.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.126
Oh Jesus Christ,
I just saw the scrotum again.

23:39.126 --> 23:41.795
Walk it off. Walk it off.
It was an accident. Oh...

23:45.257 --> 23:46.716
The TPS reports.

23:46.716 --> 23:48.301
Thanks.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.599
So, what did you have
to buy Colleen

23:54.599 --> 23:56.184
to get this address
out of her?

23:56.309 --> 23:58.770
- Hi.
- A new car.

23:58.770 --> 24:01.231
Wait, if you--
If you'd seen the shit box

24:01.356 --> 24:03.150
that she was taking
the goddamn baby out in--

24:03.150 --> 24:04.734
- Hey, shh. Language.
- Oh, sorry.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.279
Okay, I don't want you here.

24:07.279 --> 24:10.031
This is a fresh start for me
and I do not need this bullshit.

24:10.157 --> 24:11.158
Shh. Language.

24:14.327 --> 24:16.121
You're sleeping
with your new boss

24:16.121 --> 24:17.873
and you don't want
me to come in, right,

24:17.873 --> 24:20.041
because you don't want him
comparing himself t--

24:20.041 --> 24:22.419
Hi, Janet.
Oh, hi, uh, Bob.

24:22.669 --> 24:25.464
Uh, this is
my ex-husband, uh--

24:25.714 --> 24:28.258
- Tommy.
- Uh, Tommy. Sorry.

24:28.383 --> 24:29.885
- Um, Bob, Tommy.
- Hi.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.011
How you doing?

24:31.011 --> 24:33.847
Janet, here are the specs
on that new boutique building.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.307
- Okay.
- Digest that, I'll run over

24:35.307 --> 24:37.350
- it all with you after lunch.
- Great. Thanks.

24:37.350 --> 24:39.519
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

24:46.693 --> 24:47.903
Don't get cocky.

24:48.028 --> 24:50.739
I'm not getting cocky.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.741
You know, I assume that you
not only got the address

24:52.866 --> 24:54.326
from Colleen
but you also finagled

24:54.326 --> 24:56.119
the fact that I have
a boyfriend named Bob.

24:56.244 --> 24:58.330
Yes, but Colleen--
She lied about--

24:58.330 --> 25:00.499
Yeah, well, that's not
the Bob that I'm sleeping with.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.667
- Uh, this is.
- What?

25:02.918 --> 25:04.836
- Hey.
- Hi, uh, Bob,

25:04.836 --> 25:07.964
this is uh, my ex,
Tommy Gavin.

25:08.089 --> 25:09.758
- Tommy, how you doing?
- Hi, how are you.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.301
J, we've got a showing
in 10 minutes.

25:11.426 --> 25:12.511
Yeah.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.971
She's taken to this job
like she was born to it.

25:14.971 --> 25:16.556
- She's a natural.
- Yeah.

25:16.681 --> 25:18.808
- Ready when you are.
- Okay, let me check my desk.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.477
Nice to meet you, Tommy.

25:20.477 --> 25:22.020
I really admire what you do.

25:22.270 --> 25:24.773
Keeping the world safe
for the rest of us schmucks.

25:24.898 --> 25:27.776
- J, 5 minutes?
- Yeah.

25:36.076 --> 25:38.411
- What'd you tell him about me?
- Don't.

25:38.411 --> 25:39.829
You know, I could--

25:39.955 --> 25:41.456
I could be wearing
a suit like that too

25:41.456 --> 25:43.166
if I wanted to spend
my money on myself,

25:43.291 --> 25:45.335
but I'd prefer
to spend my money--

25:45.460 --> 25:47.212
Our money on us.

25:47.212 --> 25:48.922
On you and me and the kids.

25:48.922 --> 25:50.215
- Here you go, okay?
- What's that?

25:50.215 --> 25:51.299
It's a credit card.

25:51.424 --> 25:53.385
- N-no, I don't want it.
- No, I want you to have this

25:53.385 --> 25:54.803
in case there's anything--

25:54.928 --> 25:56.972
- An emergency.
- No, I don't want any of Sheila's money.

25:56.972 --> 26:00.225
Does it say Sheila Keefe
on there? It says Janet Gavin, okay?

26:00.225 --> 26:02.018
It's not-- It's not
a loan, it's our money.

26:02.143 --> 26:04.104
She's over the baby thing,
the whole nine yards,

26:04.104 --> 26:06.815
- so just take it.
- What, she has no interest in Wyatt?

26:07.023 --> 26:10.694
Wyatt. Okay, we're changing
the baby's name.

26:10.819 --> 26:14.406
Did you see the reviews for
the latest Kevin Costner thing?

26:14.406 --> 26:16.741
The corporate killer
Mr. Brooks thing?

26:16.741 --> 26:18.743
His name is Wyatt. Forever.

26:18.743 --> 26:20.912
Even Bob seems to love it.

26:20.912 --> 26:24.499
Which Bob?
The short, uh, balding Bob?

26:24.499 --> 26:27.335
Or, big, tall, handsome,
I'm-banging-your-wife Bob.

26:27.460 --> 26:29.004
Huh?

26:29.004 --> 26:30.839
The thing--
His eyes, th-those are--

26:30.839 --> 26:32.173
They call them
cat's eye lenses.

26:32.299 --> 26:34.217
Chicks wear 'em, okay?
Modeling chicks.

26:34.342 --> 26:36.428
That's the first time I
ever saw a guy wear them.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.597
That's what you got.
And he's got husky-dog eyes.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.265
Ow.

26:40.265 --> 26:43.143
Go. Go. Go.

27:05.206 --> 27:06.833
- Yeah.
- Hey, what are you doing?

27:07.167 --> 27:09.461
Nothing, why?
What are you doing?

27:09.461 --> 27:11.546
Ah, the same.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.006
Oh, cool.

27:13.131 --> 27:15.216
So, you know, just, ah,
calling to check

27:15.216 --> 27:16.384
in and see
how you're doing.

27:16.509 --> 27:17.761
You all right?

27:17.886 --> 27:20.680
Uh, I don't know, man.

27:20.680 --> 27:23.350
You know, I-I sometimes--

27:23.350 --> 27:25.977
It's almost been a year now
and-- And I haven't had a drop

27:25.977 --> 27:27.646
and, yeah,
do I have a clear head?

27:27.646 --> 27:29.356
Yeah, I have a clear head.
Do I have clarity?

27:29.356 --> 27:31.858
Yeah, but, you know,
what else do I have to show for it?

27:31.858 --> 27:33.151
You know what I mean?
Nothing.

27:33.151 --> 27:34.903
What do you mean,
"nothing to show for it"?

27:35.028 --> 27:37.197
You're clean.
You're living an honest life.

27:37.197 --> 27:38.782
What are you so afraid of?

27:38.907 --> 27:40.241
I--I'm not afraid of--
Wh-What--

27:40.367 --> 27:41.951
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- Bullshit.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.079
You're waking up honest
and with clarity and with

27:44.079 --> 27:46.623
full knowledge of what you said
and you did the night before.

27:46.748 --> 27:48.124
Huh? You want to
feel the other way?

27:48.249 --> 27:49.584
I tell you what, take a hammer

27:49.584 --> 27:51.086
and hit yourself
three full good shots

27:51.086 --> 27:52.754
in the side of your head
when you wake up

27:52.754 --> 27:54.798
in the morning and see how
that feels, all right?

27:54.923 --> 27:57.050
You're right.
You know, I'm-- I'm--

27:57.050 --> 27:59.386
I'm glad you called.
I me-- I'm serious.

27:59.594 --> 28:02.055
You helped me.
You know. You're right.

28:02.055 --> 28:03.723
Yeah, not a problem.

28:03.723 --> 28:04.891
All right.

28:30.750 --> 28:32.585
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doing?

28:32.585 --> 28:36.589
Um, the knee's still really sore,
but, you know, I feel better.

28:36.589 --> 28:38.299
- A-a lot better.
- Yeah?

28:38.299 --> 28:39.676
What are you doing?

28:39.801 --> 28:42.303
Um, nothing, jus--
Just chillin'.

28:43.972 --> 28:45.432
- Doing what?
- Nothing.

28:45.640 --> 28:46.933
You're moping, aren't you?

28:46.933 --> 28:48.601
No, I-I'm not moping.

28:48.601 --> 28:51.855
Yeah, y-you're having
a giant mope fest over there, aren't you?

28:51.980 --> 28:54.816
- No, I-I was just... reading.
- You're reading.

28:54.941 --> 28:56.401
That guarantees me
that you're moping.

28:56.651 --> 28:58.194
All right? Here's what
I want you to do.

28:58.319 --> 29:00.321
When they were bringing me
down at the fire escape

29:00.321 --> 29:01.906
the other night by your place,

29:01.906 --> 29:04.075
I noticed down the block
there's a bar/caf thing.

29:04.075 --> 29:05.785
I want you to put away
the ice cream.

29:05.785 --> 29:07.662
Yeah, I know
you're eating ice cream, yeah.

29:07.787 --> 29:09.330
That which guarantees again, moping.

29:09.456 --> 29:10.832
I want you to put on
something nice,

29:10.957 --> 29:13.126
go down there a-and meet
somebody. All right?

29:13.126 --> 29:14.210
Preferably a girl.

29:14.335 --> 29:16.671
I-I got another call coming in.

29:16.796 --> 29:18.089
Bye.

29:18.089 --> 29:19.340
Yeah?

29:19.340 --> 29:20.842
You busy tonight?

29:20.967 --> 29:23.470
I'm working at the fire house.

29:23.678 --> 29:25.430
- Why?
- Literally?

29:25.680 --> 29:27.891
I only need you
for about three minutes.

29:28.016 --> 29:31.186
Yeah, well, I know but it'll
take me 45 to get over there

29:31.186 --> 29:33.772
and another 45 to get back.
I really-- I can't do it.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.857
Can I take a rain check?

29:38.067 --> 29:39.444
Egh.

29:41.446 --> 29:42.739
All right, pal.

29:43.364 --> 29:44.783
Here.

29:46.201 --> 29:47.285
Here, ready?

29:48.703 --> 29:50.330
Ready?

29:50.330 --> 29:52.123
I want you to fetch, all right?

29:53.041 --> 29:55.043
Fetch, ready?
One, two, three, go.

29:56.461 --> 30:00.048
Get it. Look. Look at the ball.

30:00.173 --> 30:01.424
See the kid chasing the ball?

30:01.549 --> 30:04.135
Dogs have been doing this for ages
with their owners, pal.

30:04.135 --> 30:06.179
Thank you, appreciate it.

30:06.179 --> 30:09.849
Charlie. Charlie. Ch--

30:11.267 --> 30:12.936
Ugh, whatever.

30:13.394 --> 30:14.813
Hello?

30:14.813 --> 30:15.897
It's me.

30:16.022 --> 30:18.066
Hey, how you doing?

30:18.066 --> 30:22.153
We uh, kind of been missing
you at the family meetings.

30:22.153 --> 30:23.988
Yeah, I'll bet.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.907
Listen, I need to talk to you.

30:25.907 --> 30:28.159
Go ahead, talk away. I got
nothing but time right now.

30:28.159 --> 30:29.327
- What?
- No, no, no.

30:29.327 --> 30:31.412
- In person. Face to face.
- Why?

30:31.412 --> 30:33.957
Because I'm your
goddamn father, that's why.

30:34.165 --> 30:36.167
- Meet me at Hanrahan's.
- The bar?

30:36.292 --> 30:38.378
No. The synagogue.

30:38.378 --> 30:41.548
Asshole. Be here within
an hour and come alone.

30:41.881 --> 30:45.260
All right, nice talking to you.

30:45.385 --> 30:46.553
Hey, what do you got?

30:46.761 --> 30:48.346
Hey. Come here.

30:48.346 --> 30:50.890
Oh, Jesus. Egh.

30:51.891 --> 30:54.477
Well, it's a start.

30:54.477 --> 30:58.064
Come on. Drop it.
Drop it. Drop it.

30:58.565 --> 30:59.858
Drop it.

31:07.073 --> 31:08.658
You quit drinking?

31:09.033 --> 31:12.704
Shh, shh, shh.
It's between me and you, huh?

31:12.704 --> 31:13.872
Yeah, I know.

31:14.747 --> 31:15.999
Ten days now.

31:15.999 --> 31:19.002
And you decide to quit
while you're sitting,

31:19.002 --> 31:21.588
every day apparently,
here in Hanrahan's bar?

31:21.588 --> 31:23.923
Three feet away
from every conceivable

31:23.923 --> 31:25.133
imaginable type of booze?

31:25.133 --> 31:27.886
You sit here all day drinking
coffee and tea and this is how--

31:28.011 --> 31:29.178
How you test yourself?

31:29.304 --> 31:31.139
You gotta face
your fears, kid.

31:31.139 --> 31:32.807
Look them straight in the eye.

31:32.932 --> 31:36.769
I spent 60 some odd years
belting down the booze.

31:36.769 --> 31:40.815
I might as well try
my last 15 or so sober.

31:40.815 --> 31:42.483
See what it's like.

31:42.609 --> 31:45.111
You're planning on living to be, like,
97 years old?

31:45.111 --> 31:46.362
Why not?

31:46.362 --> 31:49.240
- My dad did.
- Uh-huh.

31:49.240 --> 31:52.410
Listen. I'm doing this my way.

31:52.410 --> 31:55.204
So... why did you
ask me down here?

31:55.330 --> 31:57.206
I want you to tell me
about what you guys

31:57.332 --> 31:59.208
are talking about
in the meeting, you know?

31:59.334 --> 32:02.378
Just so I can you, know,
kind of, like, compare notes.

32:02.503 --> 32:06.925
We're talking about God.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.509
God?

32:08.509 --> 32:10.595
Yeah, you know. Faith.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.221
Christ.

32:12.221 --> 32:14.891
Yeah, well, I know how you
feel about those two.

32:14.891 --> 32:16.893
The great all powerful God.

32:16.893 --> 32:20.104
Where was God when I landed
on a beach in Normandy and

32:20.229 --> 32:22.607
every other guy was
getting his head blown off?

32:22.607 --> 32:24.817
When I had to fight off
those five Nazis.

32:24.817 --> 32:27.737
Fighting for my life with
only a rock in my bare hands?

32:27.737 --> 32:29.739
Where was God then, huh?

32:29.739 --> 32:31.824
Don't talk to me about God.

32:31.824 --> 32:35.036
As far as I'm concerned,
God was your mother.

32:35.036 --> 32:38.831
The way she raise you kids,
the love she showed you.

32:38.831 --> 32:41.250
The way she helped you
overcome all the stuff

32:41.250 --> 32:43.252
that scared
the shit out of you.

32:43.252 --> 32:45.380
The height thing,
the bee thing,

32:45.546 --> 32:47.298
your mother was a saint.

32:47.548 --> 32:49.801
What heights thing?
I'm not afraid of heights.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.302
What are you talking about?

32:51.302 --> 32:53.346
I'm a goddamn fireman
for Christ's sake.

32:53.346 --> 32:55.890
I'm up on the ladder or in the
bucket every other goddamn day.

32:56.015 --> 32:57.058
No, not now. Thanks to her.

32:57.058 --> 32:59.936
Christ, she couldn't even
put you in the highchair.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.521
But sh-she cured you.

33:01.521 --> 33:04.148
She took you up on the roof,
and held you over the side

33:04.148 --> 33:06.401
and tickled you with her nose.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.695
Next thing you know,
you were begging her

33:08.695 --> 33:10.321
to throw you up in the air.

33:10.321 --> 33:11.739
What was the bee thing?

33:11.739 --> 33:13.574
You were
deathly afraid of them.

33:13.700 --> 33:16.077
You used to wear
a wool hat in the summer

33:16.077 --> 33:17.787
so they wouldn't
bite you on the head.

33:17.912 --> 33:19.414
I don't think
you ever got over that.

33:19.539 --> 33:21.833
- Oh, there's one now.
- Where?

33:23.042 --> 33:24.335
Gotcha.

34:15.428 --> 34:16.596
Hello?

34:16.596 --> 34:18.639
- Hello.
- Shh.

34:18.765 --> 34:20.349
Wh-Why do I
gotta be quiet for?

34:24.479 --> 34:25.480
Hang on.

34:31.819 --> 34:33.404
Done, okay.

34:33.404 --> 34:34.989
Now I can talk.

34:35.198 --> 34:36.866
I was just wondering
what's up with Elvis.

34:36.991 --> 34:38.451
You know,
c-can I tell you one thing?

34:38.451 --> 34:41.329
The Elvis thing,
that name has to go. Okay?

34:41.454 --> 34:43.539
Because-- I mean, by the time
he gets to high school,

34:43.664 --> 34:45.541
kids are gonna
be dropping drugs at his feet

34:45.666 --> 34:47.835
and peanut butter--
Fried peanut butter sandwiches.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.171
- Okay?
- Elvis is evergreen, asshole.

34:50.296 --> 34:52.256
It's like Jesus.
It's a sacred name.

34:52.256 --> 34:55.510
It's not like Jesus.
It's nothing like Jesus.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.512
I-I got the baby coming
back in a couple of days

34:57.512 --> 34:59.680
and then basically it's just
you and me sharing him.

34:59.806 --> 35:01.349
Yay.

35:01.349 --> 35:04.894
Yeah. By the way, you, uh--
What floor are you on now?

35:05.019 --> 35:06.187
I live on the Fifth floor, why?

35:06.187 --> 35:07.355
What about w-window guards?

35:07.480 --> 35:10.024
You got window guards
and things out there on t-the terrace?

35:10.274 --> 35:11.526
The kid can barely sit up.

35:11.651 --> 35:13.402
How's he going to make
it out to the terrace?

35:13.528 --> 35:14.779
All right,
he starts sitting up.

35:14.779 --> 35:16.906
Next thing you know he sees
a bird he wants to touch

35:17.031 --> 35:19.408
and he goes out there,
seconds later he's bouncing off

35:19.534 --> 35:20.535
the roof of a taxi, okay?

35:20.535 --> 35:22.537
Eric Clapton's kid?
Does that ring a bell, huh?

35:22.662 --> 35:24.914
Oh, okay. Well,
I'll get some window guards.

35:25.039 --> 35:26.457
You're sure it's the fifth floor

35:26.457 --> 35:28.668
because it seemed awfully
much higher than that

35:28.668 --> 35:30.002
the last time I was there.

35:30.002 --> 35:32.755
I think I know
what floor I live on, you big dipshit.

35:32.755 --> 35:34.632
Anywho, so day after tomorrow?

35:34.632 --> 35:35.967
Yeah, yeah.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.343
I'm so excited, I can't wait.

35:37.343 --> 35:39.470
All right, I'll talk to you later. Bye.

35:39.470 --> 35:41.556
Jesus Christ. Unbelievable.

35:41.556 --> 35:43.349
Bless me father
for I have sinned.

35:43.349 --> 35:45.393
It has been three days
since my last confession.

35:45.393 --> 35:47.145
These are my sins.

35:49.188 --> 35:50.439
Um...

35:51.858 --> 35:54.402
I took the name
of the lord in vain 67 times.

35:54.402 --> 35:57.113
I was envious of my neighbor Shirley
and her new boyfriend, Sal.

35:57.238 --> 35:59.907
I stole the newspaper from
Shirley's doorstep one morning

35:59.907 --> 36:02.410
and I had impure thoughts
while I was watching

36:02.410 --> 36:04.745
last week's episode
of <i>According to Jim.</i>

36:06.873 --> 36:08.708
Father?

36:09.375 --> 36:11.169
I'm sorry.

36:12.086 --> 36:14.672
I won't watch
that show any more.

36:14.672 --> 36:17.216
Well, um, no--

36:17.216 --> 36:20.428
God wants you to watch the--

36:20.428 --> 36:23.639
I don't think
he cares about t-the show.

36:23.639 --> 36:25.433
I think you should, uh--

36:26.100 --> 36:28.102
Just cut down on t-the name

36:28.311 --> 36:31.230
in vain thing and the stealing thing
is probably not a good idea

36:31.230 --> 36:32.315
And uh...

36:35.067 --> 36:38.696
just, you know, say, um--
Say, um, the Hail Mary.

36:38.696 --> 36:40.448
I think th--
Say, uh, one Hail Mary.

36:41.782 --> 36:43.784
Actually, just say
the last part of the Hail Mary.

36:43.910 --> 36:45.578
The last couple of lines
of the Hail Mary.

36:45.578 --> 36:47.246
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

36:47.246 --> 36:50.625
Pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death, amen.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.251
At the hour of our death. Shit.

36:52.251 --> 36:54.045
- What?
- What?

36:54.545 --> 36:57.048
- Huh?
- W-What?

36:57.048 --> 37:01.010
Huh? Um, you're all set.

37:01.969 --> 37:03.262
- That's it?
- Yep.

37:03.262 --> 37:05.264
That's, uh, total ab--
Absolution.

37:05.264 --> 37:06.724
Stay away from the name thing

37:06.724 --> 37:09.685
and the stealing thing
and you'll be... golden.

37:10.770 --> 37:12.396
- Amen.
- All right, see you.

37:20.947 --> 37:22.573
Oh, uh, the, uh--

37:23.783 --> 37:25.451
It's broke.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.233
Ugh.

38:04.407 --> 38:05.408
Ahh.

38:07.702 --> 38:10.496
<i>...Richardson has moved
to the point guard...</i>

38:10.496 --> 38:13.958
<i>...passes to Curry
...guarded by Haywood--</i>

38:13.958 --> 38:15.835
<i>Nice spin move by Curry.</i>

38:15.835 --> 38:18.587
<i>Stops at about 8--
And puts it in...</i>

38:18.587 --> 38:20.172
Ah.

38:53.664 --> 38:55.958
<i>...New York up by 12.</i>

38:55.958 --> 38:58.085
<i>Daniels brings

38:58.085 --> 39:00.296
<i>Needs some help...

39:00.296 --> 39:02.465
<i>...stops at

39:02.465 --> 39:05.051

39:15.144 --> 39:16.520
Buy me a drink.

39:24.528 --> 39:25.946
Yeah.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.032
Totally. What--

39:28.032 --> 39:29.408
What are you drinking?

39:29.408 --> 39:30.701
I'm having a bourbon.

39:30.701 --> 39:31.911
- Bourbon, okay.
- Mm-hmm.

39:33.746 --> 39:34.955
Hey, I'm--

39:35.081 --> 39:37.708
- I'm sorry, bartender.
- Yeah?

39:37.708 --> 39:41.253
Could I get
a bourbon for the lady?

39:42.922 --> 39:45.341
You're really super cute,
do you know that?

39:46.050 --> 39:48.719
You have this
boyishness about you.

39:48.928 --> 39:51.514
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

39:51.639 --> 39:53.766
You have really soulful eyes.

39:55.184 --> 39:56.185
Thanks.

39:58.979 --> 40:00.981
Ah, well, what do you think of me?

40:00.981 --> 40:05.194
Oh, y-you... you're slamming.

40:05.444 --> 40:08.823
- Yeah?
- Yeah. You're totally hot.

40:08.948 --> 40:10.574
Well, thank you, sweetie pie.

40:14.995 --> 40:18.249
How'd you like to get in on
a little mother-daughter action?

40:19.500 --> 40:20.918
Wow.

40:27.508 --> 40:28.551
Let's go.

40:30.094 --> 40:32.054
<i>...Daniels gets free...</i>

40:34.723 --> 40:36.725
<i>...puts it up
and gets blocked by...</i>

40:36.725 --> 40:38.227
Agh.

40:38.352 --> 40:40.521
<i>...that's okay.
Washington gets it back...</i>

40:40.521 --> 40:42.523
<i>That's Curry's second block
on Haywood...</i>

40:42.648 --> 40:44.191
Oh, this could be a problem.

40:44.191 --> 40:45.943
<i>...with ten seconds
on the shot...</i>

40:51.866 --> 40:53.534
So do you want a drink first

40:54.660 --> 40:56.912
or, uh, do you wanna
just get right to it?

40:57.037 --> 41:01.667
Well, I-I guess w-we should
j-just get right to it, right?

41:01.667 --> 41:03.961
- Okay.
- Yeah.

41:08.883 --> 41:11.218
Ma, you still up?

41:14.263 --> 41:16.557
Well, well,

41:16.557 --> 41:19.560
he's delicious.

41:24.690 --> 41:26.400
Here's a new one, boys.

41:26.400 --> 41:29.069
We got a window washer
hanging off a broken scaffold

41:29.195 --> 41:30.696
on the side of a building.

41:30.696 --> 41:32.031
How high up are we talking?

41:32.031 --> 41:33.240
Only 35 floors.

41:33.240 --> 41:35.534
I thought those guys
are supposed to work in pairs.

41:35.534 --> 41:36.911
Yeah,
well, bachelor number two

41:37.036 --> 41:38.954
took a nosedive
and kissed the curb.

41:38.954 --> 41:40.915
Guess the curb
didn't kiss back, huh?

41:56.472 --> 41:58.724
<i>Attention all
responding units...</i>

41:58.849 --> 42:00.768
And Humpty Dumpty
had a great fall.

42:00.768 --> 42:02.728
He just lost points
on his landing.

42:02.728 --> 42:03.938
Let's go, ladies.

42:08.067 --> 42:09.944
All right, what do we got?

42:09.944 --> 42:11.612
He just
regained consciousness.

42:11.612 --> 42:13.697
He keeps reaching for
that rope, he's going to loosen

42:13.697 --> 42:15.574
the knot and join his buddy
on the pavement.

42:15.574 --> 42:17.326
Jesus Christ.
Gavin, you're up.

42:17.451 --> 42:19.245
Hey, I'll go with you, Tom.

42:19.245 --> 42:21.622
Negative. That thing
won't take the weight.

42:21.622 --> 42:23.374
Come on, Tommy, let's go.

42:30.548 --> 42:32.091
Right, uh...

42:32.591 --> 42:34.718
Help me!

42:34.718 --> 42:36.679
Come on, he's not gonna
make it much longer.

42:36.804 --> 42:38.055
Get out there.

42:46.438 --> 42:48.440
Ugh.

42:48.816 --> 42:50.734
Oh, God. Help.

42:50.734 --> 42:52.319
Oh, sh--

42:52.319 --> 42:54.947
Come on, Tommy. Today.
Let's go.

42:54.947 --> 42:58.033
Ah! Ah. Please. Help me!

42:58.158 --> 43:00.578
Hey, asshole.
Stop shaking it.

43:00.578 --> 43:04.248
God. Oh... Whoo.

43:04.248 --> 43:06.292
Come on, what's the hold up,
Tommy? Move.

43:06.292 --> 43:09.795
All right. Hang on.

43:10.045 --> 43:11.422
Ah...

43:15.551 --> 43:18.846
Mother of God. Oh, shit.

43:18.846 --> 43:21.140
Pray for us sinners...

43:21.140 --> 43:23.225
now...

43:23.350 --> 43:25.394
and in the hour
of our death, amen.

43:25.519 --> 43:26.812
Okay.

43:28.230 --> 43:29.648
Here I come, pal.

43:29.648 --> 43:31.483
Easy.

43:34.862 --> 43:37.906
Okay... here comes a rope.
Oka--

43:38.032 --> 43:39.366
- You ready?
- Yeah.

43:40.659 --> 43:42.411
- You got it?
- Yeah.

43:42.745 --> 43:44.413
- Holy, shit.
- All right.

43:44.413 --> 43:46.290
Bring him in smooth, Tommy.
Don't rock it.

43:46.957 --> 43:48.125
Come on.

43:49.084 --> 43:50.085
You got it?

43:55.382 --> 43:57.343
That's it. That's it.

44:01.805 --> 44:02.931
Thank you.

44:02.931 --> 44:04.850
- All right.
- Ah.

44:04.975 --> 44:07.686
Get him in now before
the rig goes, Tommy, come on.

44:07.686 --> 44:09.855
Boys, take a hole.
Jesus Christ.

44:11.815 --> 44:12.858
You okay?

44:12.858 --> 44:14.485
Okay, let's get inside now.

44:14.485 --> 44:16.570
Don't look down.
