[Humming]

00:39.040 --> 00:40.040
Mmm.

00:42.120 --> 00:44.120
What a great day!

00:44.559 --> 00:48.239
But it's been windy and rainy
since we woke up.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.919
And somebody forgot to close
the door again.

00:52.040 --> 00:55.879
No, I mean, it's a great day
because of this!

00:56.040 --> 00:58.279
-What is it?
-Fortune cookies

00:58.440 --> 01:00.800
from my friend at the Chinese restaurant!

01:01.000 --> 01:02.959
You know how I love Chinese food!

01:03.800 --> 01:05.200
[Ollie] I might have noticed.

01:05.640 --> 01:07.679
My favourite part is these fortune cookies

01:07.840 --> 01:08.759
you get at the end.

01:09.479 --> 01:11.039
The little slips of paper inside

01:11.240 --> 01:12.880
tell you what's gonna happen to you!

01:13.039 --> 01:15.800
They tell... the future!

01:17.320 --> 01:19.759
The future? I don't think so.

01:20.119 --> 01:21.679
-They do.
-They don't.

01:21.800 --> 01:25.200
They do! You don't believe me?
Watch this!

01:25.360 --> 01:27.960
"You will enjoy a delicious cookie."

01:28.800 --> 01:32.000
Mmm. So delicious!

01:32.160 --> 01:34.039
-It was right!
-That doesn't count!

01:34.200 --> 01:36.080
Then let's try another one.

01:36.280 --> 01:38.720
"Your day is filled with sunshine."

01:38.880 --> 01:42.160
Ha! Wrong! Look out the window!

01:46.240 --> 01:49.160
-See? Sunshine!
-That was just luck!

01:49.320 --> 01:52.839
-And it won't last. You'll see.
-No, you'll see!

01:53.000 --> 01:57.080
I can prove I'm right.
In fact, I'm having a brainstorm!

01:57.240 --> 01:59.919
Uh-oh. Every time you have a brainstorm,

02:00.080 --> 02:01.839
I get dragged off somewhere.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.320
We'll do whatever the fortunes say,
all day long,

02:04.479 --> 02:07.080
-and we'll see who's right!
-Which will be me.

02:07.240 --> 02:10.280
So let's do it. Open a cookie, Moon!

02:10.919 --> 02:14.160
"A delightful surprise
and amazing discovery await you

02:14.320 --> 02:16.840
-in China!"
-Hold on. Where?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.359
China! Pack it up, buddy. We're going!

02:19.519 --> 02:21.959
-But that's so far!
-But you agreed!

02:22.959 --> 02:25.480
Fine. But I'm taking my biggest backpack.

02:25.640 --> 02:28.920
I can't wait to prove me right.
How about you, Ollie?

02:29.079 --> 02:31.760
I can't wait either. To prove you wrong.

02:39.640 --> 02:41.079
Whee!

02:48.320 --> 02:52.840
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we are now arriving in China.</i>

02:59.000 --> 03:04.200
Ah! I love China!
Look at all the fuzzy panda bears, Ollie!

03:04.359 --> 03:06.720
Did you know it's my dream to hug one?

03:08.640 --> 03:10.760
Look at all the paper lanterns!

03:11.600 --> 03:14.760
Excuse me!
What are all these decorations for?

03:14.920 --> 03:16.679
It's for the Mid-Autumn Festival,

03:16.840 --> 03:18.840
also known as the Moon Festival!

03:19.200 --> 03:21.120
A Me Festival?

03:21.640 --> 03:24.920
-No, a Moon Festival.
-That's what I said.

03:25.399 --> 03:30.280
-Are those Me cakes?
-No, they're Moon cakes.

03:30.440 --> 03:31.920
Thanks! That's what I said.

03:34.760 --> 03:36.760
This is my kind of place!

03:37.959 --> 03:40.079
Awfully delightful, isn't it, Ollie?

03:40.239 --> 03:44.280
Sure. But the cookie promised
a delightful surprise.

03:44.399 --> 03:45.399
So where is it?

03:45.560 --> 03:47.000
Whoa!

03:47.720 --> 03:52.399
There it is! Firecrackers!
See? The cookie was right.

03:52.519 --> 03:54.760
-Again.
-It was just luck.

03:54.920 --> 03:56.200
Open another one.

03:57.480 --> 04:00.679
"Where animals gather,
you'll be showered with joy."

04:00.799 --> 04:01.720
Hmm.

04:01.839 --> 04:04.280
Now where do animals gather?

04:07.119 --> 04:09.760
A nature reserve! Perfect!

04:11.839 --> 04:17.000
Ooh! It's so beautiful!
Look at all the bamboo!

04:17.120 --> 04:19.039
And the gorgeous little stream!

04:19.159 --> 04:22.640
Just like the cookie said,
I already feel joyful!

04:22.800 --> 04:24.800
Hmm. Not me.

04:24.920 --> 04:26.920
I feel hot and sweaty.

04:27.039 --> 04:30.719
OK. Now there are supposed
to be monkeys and panda bears!

04:30.880 --> 04:32.080
Why aren't they gathering?

04:32.240 --> 04:34.400
Because the cookie is wrong, Moon.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.400
I do not feel a shower of joy!

04:39.000 --> 04:41.120
[laughs]

04:41.280 --> 04:43.360
Now <i>that </i>was a shower of joy!

04:43.479 --> 04:44.479
[chuckles]

04:45.919 --> 04:48.200
Good thing I packed my hair dryer.

04:50.200 --> 04:53.800
Give up, Ollie!
Ready to admit the cookie was right?

04:54.080 --> 04:56.840
Not a chance! Try another one!

04:56.960 --> 05:00.400
You'll see.
It's just been luck this whole time!

05:00.520 --> 05:03.960
"Open a gate to adventure
and follow your dreams!"

05:04.240 --> 05:06.479
Come on! Let's find a gate!

05:08.640 --> 05:09.800
Here it is!

05:10.200 --> 05:12.719
The gate to adventure and dreams!

05:19.800 --> 05:22.560
Hello, adventure! Hello, dreams!

05:23.120 --> 05:25.479
Nope. Your cookie was wrong, Moon!

05:25.680 --> 05:27.960
I win. Let's go home.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.760
Give it a second, Ollie!
The cookie will be right.

05:30.919 --> 05:33.400
It always is! Come on, adventure!

05:33.680 --> 05:34.640
Come on, dreams!

05:34.800 --> 05:35.880
Admit it, Moon.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.880
The cookie is a big phony.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.599
-No, it isn't!
-Yes, it...

05:39.719 --> 05:40.560
[rustling]

05:40.680 --> 05:42.320
Hmm. What's going on?

05:43.520 --> 05:46.200
-Ollie? Moon?
-Scoot!

05:46.320 --> 05:48.520
We haven't seen you in a long time!

05:48.719 --> 05:50.919
Did you get lost exploring again?

05:51.080 --> 05:54.000
-What are you doing in China?
-China?

05:54.919 --> 05:59.719
Is that where I am?
Oh! My map was upside down!

05:59.840 --> 06:02.400
-So, have you seen him?
-Seen who?

06:02.520 --> 06:05.919
The giant panda!
Somebody opened the gate and let him out.

06:06.080 --> 06:09.080
Somebody let the giant panda out
of the nature reserve, Moon.

06:09.240 --> 06:11.200
Just left the gate open, Moon.

06:11.359 --> 06:12.400
[gasps]

06:12.520 --> 06:14.520
What kind of careless person

06:14.680 --> 06:17.799
would open a panda gate
and then not close it?

06:17.960 --> 06:19.320
What kind of...

06:20.120 --> 06:23.799
Oh. I left the door open again, didn't I?

06:24.880 --> 06:26.440
OK, bye!

06:26.599 --> 06:29.440
And all because you listened to a cookie!

06:29.560 --> 06:32.000
A cookie that does <i>not </i>know your future!

06:32.120 --> 06:34.080
It does, too! You'll see!

06:34.400 --> 06:36.120
Now let's find that panda!

06:40.520 --> 06:44.039
-Anybody seen this panda?
-Anybody at all?

06:51.320 --> 06:53.840
How could we lose a giant panda?

06:53.960 --> 06:56.359
-They're giant!
-Where is he?

07:01.039 --> 07:02.000
Oh!

07:02.640 --> 07:05.240
Wait!
The magic cookie will know what to do!

07:05.359 --> 07:08.479
No. It was the cookie
that made us lose the giant panda

07:08.640 --> 07:10.239
in the first place!

07:10.400 --> 07:13.400
-Where's the magic in that?
-You're right, Ollie.

07:13.560 --> 07:16.599
All this time,
my fortune <i>hasn't </i>come true.

07:16.760 --> 07:19.520
Maybe the cookie <i>isn't </i>magic.

07:19.680 --> 07:23.520
Yes! I win! I win! Ha, ha, ha!

07:23.680 --> 07:26.880
Maybe there's no magic
in this world at all.

07:27.039 --> 07:28.479
[sniffs]

07:28.640 --> 07:29.840
Well, but, Moon,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.760
I never said there was no magic
in the whole world.

07:32.919 --> 07:35.000
No, you've proven it to me, Ollie.

07:35.159 --> 07:36.840
And now there's a panda lost out there

07:37.000 --> 07:41.280
-and it's all my fault.
-But... Oh, don't be sad, Moon!

07:41.440 --> 07:43.159
I can't stand it when you're sad!

07:43.320 --> 07:45.960
I just can't help it, Ollie.
The cookie's a dud.

07:46.320 --> 07:48.200
And there's no way to fix this.

07:48.359 --> 07:50.640
I mean, it's not like
we have a giant panda whistle

07:50.799 --> 07:53.120
to call the giant panda with, do we?

07:53.280 --> 07:54.760
[gasps] Moon!

07:54.919 --> 07:57.840
If I could make a giant panda whistle
appear out of thin air,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.799
-would that be sort of magic?
-Are you kidding, Ollie?

08:00.960 --> 08:03.520
That would be the most magical thing ever!

08:03.679 --> 08:06.719
Good thing I packed
my rare giant panda whistle.

08:06.840 --> 08:08.039
Watch this!

08:11.200 --> 08:12.120
[response]

08:12.280 --> 08:14.200
The panda! Do it again!

08:16.080 --> 08:17.080
[response]

08:17.239 --> 08:19.039
It's coming from over there!

08:28.000 --> 08:29.400
There he is! Come on, Moon!

08:29.760 --> 08:30.880
Whoa!

08:31.000 --> 08:31.840
[she gasps]

08:33.319 --> 08:34.280
Yes!

08:39.079 --> 08:41.760
[they scream]

08:45.439 --> 08:48.880
The Panda! Oh, he's so fluffy, Ollie!

08:49.040 --> 08:53.280
Talk about magic!
You just gotta hug him and squeeze him!

08:53.400 --> 08:54.800
If it makes you happy, Moon.

08:54.920 --> 08:55.720
[they laugh]

08:55.840 --> 08:58.520
Mr Panda, I'm sorry I left your gate open.

08:58.959 --> 09:01.120
Now you have to go back
to the nature reserve!

09:01.240 --> 09:04.280
Everyone is gonna be so glad to see you.

even though the last fortune
didn't work out at all.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.400
But wait, Moon, it did!

<i>We opened a gate.</i>

09:50.920 --> 09:52.199
<i>We had an adventure.</i>

09:52.360 --> 09:54.480
And, remember,
your biggest dream has always been...

09:54.640 --> 09:56.160
To hug a panda!

09:56.319 --> 10:00.079
Yep.
Every fortune magically came true all day!

10:00.199 --> 10:04.720
Wow! Well, except for the first one
about an amazing discovery.

10:04.880 --> 10:06.920
But they still almost all came true.

10:07.079 --> 10:11.000
You know, all this excitement
has made me hungry. Let's eat!

10:11.160 --> 10:13.720
Yeah. And the best part will be...

10:13.880 --> 10:16.400
The fortune cookies!

10:21.160 --> 10:22.400
Well, what do you know.

10:22.560 --> 10:25.079
They don't even have fortune cookies
in China.

10:25.240 --> 10:29.000
Yeah. They were invented
in San Francisco, USA! Who knew?

10:29.160 --> 10:30.880
What an amazing discovery!

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000

10:32.120 --> 10:34.439
The cookie was right!

10:37.640 --> 10:39.800
-Cookie, Moon?
-Weird.

10:39.959 --> 10:41.920
Looks like someone already opened it.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.280
Even weirder.

10:44.439 --> 10:47.120
Looks like my fortune
is written in purple crayon!

10:47.240 --> 10:48.400
What's it say?

10:48.600 --> 10:51.520
"From now on, you will close the door!"

10:53.079 --> 10:55.680
I can't wait to see that fortune
come true!

10:55.839 --> 10:57.520
