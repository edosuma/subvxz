if you've given any thought

02:23.268 --> 02:25.062
to the question I posed to you yesterday.

02:26.563 --> 02:29.399
Zach, you're a really great guy.

I mean, you're probably my...best friend.

Can you get the pencils
out of your nose, please?

02:34.988 --> 02:35.989
But I think...

02:36.448 --> 02:40.327
That us going on a date right now
would be a really bad idea.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.664

02:43.747 --> 02:45.874
Your famous big shot

02:45.958 --> 02:48.919
At least tell me who it is.
Is it a movie star?

02:49.503 --> 02:51.088
Not someone too old for you.

02:51.463 --> 02:52.464

I'm fine. I'm fine.

11:28.564 --> 11:29.731
-He's in. Look at him.
-(GASPS)

11:30.440 --> 11:31.525
That's quite handsome.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.485
All right, go show 'em off.
Go show off your kicks.

REBECCA: Jackie, look at those shoes.

11:40.826 --> 11:41.952
Excuse me, ma'am,
but your husband here

11:42.035 --> 11:43.996
has been "oogling" me all day.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.748
Is it "oogling" or "ogling," by the way?

11:46.832 --> 11:48.166
-Ogling.
-You sure?

11:48.250 --> 11:49.251
-No.
-Huh.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.003
All right.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.089
Okay, that's my cue.

11:54.173 --> 11:57.009
-I'm gonna go house some cake.
-All right.

We haven't really

So...

(SIGHS)

12:11.815 --> 12:14.443
Randall, I know that
you just wanted what's best for mom.

12:15.152 --> 12:17.362
And I also know that you wouldn't
have asked her to do that trial

12:17.446 --> 12:19.531
if you hadn't done
an insane amount of research.

12:19.615 --> 12:22.492
I mean, like, Claire Danes in <i>Homeland</i>
insane research.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.077
I get that, but...

12:24.912 --> 12:26.580
I want you to know
where I'm coming from.

12:26.663 --> 12:27.956
You know? I just...

12:28.624 --> 12:30.542
Mom is in a really good place right now.

12:31.668 --> 12:32.753
She's here with her family.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.214
It's what she wants.

12:36.965 --> 12:38.592
It's what's best for her.

12:40.886 --> 12:42.346
(PATS RANDALL'S THIGH)

12:44.223 --> 12:46.642

-What?

12:47.935 --> 12:48.936
One year.

12:51.522 --> 12:52.648
Thank you.

have an adorable outfit change,

13:10.499 --> 13:11.875
Guys...

13:11.959 --> 13:13.335
So I have, um...

13:13.418 --> 13:15.170
I have a little bit of an announcement.

13:16.588 --> 13:17.840
Uh...

13:17.923 --> 13:19.049
Oh, damn.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.677
I think I left my thing in the...
That's odd.

13:24.096 --> 13:25.430
Um...

13:26.640 --> 13:29.226
I know in New York I told you boys

13:29.309 --> 13:33.105
that I was looking forward to enjoying...

13:34.189 --> 13:36.525
However much time I have left.

13:36.608 --> 13:41.196
But Miguel and I
have been doing the research, and...

13:41.280 --> 13:45.284
I have decided to do the clinical trial.

13:49.621 --> 13:53.625
So, three weeks from now,
Miguel and I are moving to St. Louis.

13:55.460 --> 13:56.712
For how long?

13:56.795 --> 13:58.338
It's nine months.

13:59.089 --> 14:02.384
But... But then we're gonna be
back here with all of you.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.678
RANDALL: We will come visit you
as much as we can, Mom.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.263
-Yeah?
-Whatever it takes.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.764
-Right, guys?
-Thank you.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.766
-Thank you, sweetheart.
-Yeah.

14:10.559 --> 14:11.560
Appreciate that.

(RANDALL BREATHES DEEPLY)

14:16.190 --> 14:17.316
This is what you want?

14:17.733 --> 14:19.026
Mmm-hmm. Yep.

14:19.651 --> 14:20.777
It is.

14:25.699 --> 14:26.700
Well, then yeah.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.285
You know? Yeah, of course.
Whatever you want.

14:29.953 --> 14:31.371

14:31.455 --> 14:32.539

to challenge the eye.

You see?
The juxtaposition of opposing colors.

I mean, mom was so sure last week.

15:58.792 --> 15:59.793
I know.

15:59.877 --> 16:02.045
We had this whole talk
when she came back from New York,

16:02.129 --> 16:04.923
and she said she was excited
to spend time with Jack,

16:05.007 --> 16:07.217
to travel. She said "carpe diem," like,

16:07.301 --> 16:09.261
-12 times. It was like...
-Mmm.

16:09.344 --> 16:11.180
She didn't say anything to you, Randall?

16:12.014 --> 16:13.974
No, she probably
just sees the clinical trial

16:14.057 --> 16:15.767
as an investment in her future.

Oh...

-Yeah.

Do you get progressively weirder
as you get older?

16:25.861 --> 16:27.279
-Is that what happened?
-Of course. Yes, that's what's happening.

16:27.362 --> 16:28.363
He gets weirder as he gets older.

16:28.447 --> 16:29.448
Okay. So then when does it end?

16:29.531 --> 16:32.201
Is it like you're gonna wake up one day
and, like, you're Steve Buscemi?

the most beautiful sound in all the land.

see that guy about that thing?

to see that guy about our...

-Cool.
-Okay.

-just for the three of us, so...
-Yeah.

special thing.

I know, babe.

to change Mom's mind.

coursing through their veins.

made me feel sad, and...

what to do with that.

22:22.050 --> 22:25.554
And I love that.
I love watching you all together.

22:25.637 --> 22:28.265
-(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
-Today, I was watching...

22:28.348 --> 22:29.558
Randall and his daughters,

22:29.641 --> 22:31.226
I was watching you
with your brothers,

22:31.310 --> 22:33.520
I was watching all of you,
and I was thinking,

22:33.604 --> 22:35.606
"Doesn't Jack deserve that?"

22:38.108 --> 22:41.904
Doesn't he deserve someone
to spend his childhood with?

22:42.821 --> 22:46.491
To lean on long after
you and I are gone?

22:48.327 --> 22:49.953
Toby, what are you saying?

22:51.371 --> 22:52.789
I'm saying, don't you think

22:52.873 --> 22:55.501
-our amazing little man...
-(JACK DAMON BABBLES)

22:55.584 --> 22:57.211
...deserves a sibling?

23:09.097 --> 23:10.766
KATE: Toby, I...

23:11.725 --> 23:13.685
I can't get pregnant again.

23:13.769 --> 23:16.813
I mean, not with
all the complications and...

23:17.814 --> 23:19.107
-I know.
-...the risks.

23:19.191 --> 23:20.609
No. I know. I know.

23:20.692 --> 23:22.528
(DISTANT BABY CRYING)

23:22.611 --> 23:27.908
But the Pearsons have a pretty good
track record with adoption, don't they?

23:29.952 --> 23:31.119
What?

23:39.336 --> 23:41.797
DR. KATOWSKI: So, you're having trouble

23:41.880 --> 23:44.716
thinking about the child that you lost,

23:44.800 --> 23:48.846
and you thought that the old man
might have some words of wisdom.

23:48.929 --> 23:52.516
Yeah, that's, uh...
That's it in a nutshell. (CHUCKLES)

23:52.599 --> 23:54.017
Hmm.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.564
I did the thing
about the lemons already, right?

23:58.647 --> 24:00.941
-You did. You did. Uh...
-(BABBLES)

24:01.024 --> 24:02.025
A year ago today.

24:02.109 --> 24:04.653
Hmm. Damn.
'Cause that was a good one.

24:05.279 --> 24:06.947
-(CHUCKLING)
-Yeah. It had a...

24:07.030 --> 24:10.200
-Sizable impact on our lives.
-JACK: Mmm-hmm.

24:10.284 --> 24:11.952
(REBECCA CHUCKLES)

24:13.120 --> 24:14.371
(REBECCA SIGHS)

24:15.247 --> 24:20.002
I... I think I told you last year, Jack,
that my wife and I lost our first child.

24:20.085 --> 24:21.962
Yeah, mmm-hmm.

24:22.921 --> 24:26.008
Well, imagine me
way back then, if you can,

24:27.050 --> 24:28.427
full of hope,

24:29.344 --> 24:31.555
-full head of hair...
-(JACK AND REBECCA CHUCKLE)

24:31.638 --> 24:34.057
...expecting my first child.

24:37.769 --> 24:39.062
(LAUGHS)

24:39.146 --> 24:41.899
I used to sing
to my wife's pregnant belly.

24:42.774 --> 24:45.527
Never had much of a voice,
but that didn't stop me.

24:46.278 --> 24:48.155
My go-to was, uh, <i>Blue Skies.</i>

24:48.238 --> 24:49.323
You know that one?

24:50.115 --> 24:51.116
Uh...

24:52.367 --> 24:55.412
(SINGING)
<i>Blue skies smilin' at me</i>

24:55.495 --> 24:58.582
<i>Nothin' but blue skies</i>

24:58.665 --> 25:00.626
<i>Do I see</i>

25:02.419 --> 25:05.589
<i>Bluebird singin' a song</i>

25:07.341 --> 25:09.635
<i>Nothin' but blue skies</i>

25:11.428 --> 25:13.430
<i>From now on</i>

25:17.392 --> 25:20.521
I sang that song every day
to my unborn child.

25:23.273 --> 25:25.275
And then we lost that child.

25:30.781 --> 25:32.282
For the first month after that,

25:32.366 --> 25:35.619
my wife and I would...sit in our den

25:35.702 --> 25:38.705
and listen to that song
on our scratchy old record player

25:38.789 --> 25:40.791
over and over and over again.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.962
It made us so sad.

25:49.174 --> 25:51.218
It was like we were
punishing ourselves.

25:53.637 --> 25:54.763
Yeah.

25:56.723 --> 26:00.894
But then one day,
my wife got pregnant again.

26:02.145 --> 26:03.647
And to my great surprise,

26:03.730 --> 26:07.568
I found myself singing
that very same song

26:07.651 --> 26:09.486
to that very same belly.

26:12.990 --> 26:15.826
And then, 25 years later,

26:15.909 --> 26:19.246
I danced with my daughter to that song
at her wedding.

26:22.541 --> 26:24.668
That song. Ah.

26:26.211 --> 26:28.839
It made us happy,
it made us sad, it made us happy again.

26:28.922 --> 26:33.719
The whole human experience
just wrapped up in that one...song.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.641
Hospitals are kind of
like that, you know.

26:41.310 --> 26:43.854
<i>These bizarre buildings</i>
<i>where people experience</i>

26:43.937 --> 26:46.356
<i>some of their greatest joys and...</i>

26:47.691 --> 26:52.112
<i>Some of the most awful tragedies.</i>

26:53.906 --> 26:55.657
<i>All under one roof.</i>

26:59.119 --> 27:01.538
I think the trick is...

27:02.247 --> 27:04.166
Not trying to keep...

27:05.042 --> 27:07.711
The joys and the tragedies apart.

27:08.629 --> 27:12.174
But you kind of got to let 'em
cozy up to one another.

27:12.257 --> 27:15.552
You know, let 'em coexist.

27:16.178 --> 27:19.264
Hey, Toby, our marriage
barely survived the year.

27:19.348 --> 27:22.559
We have a son with special needs,
we have a crazy mortgage,

27:22.643 --> 27:24.561
and adoption comes with risks.

27:24.645 --> 27:26.438
You know? I just think
we're setting ourselves up

27:26.522 --> 27:28.106
for a major body blow here.

27:28.190 --> 27:33.695
Yeah, maybe being in the NICU
just made us emotionally high.

27:35.697 --> 27:39.034
I mean, will we even really want this
once we've left the parking lot?

27:39.952 --> 27:41.036
Probably not.

27:41.995 --> 27:44.373
-Yeah.
-(ENGINE STARTS)

DR. KATOWSKI: <i>And I think</i>
<i>that if you can do that,</i>

27:54.716 --> 27:59.721
if you can manage to forge ahead
with all that joy and heartache

27:59.805 --> 28:01.765
mixed up together inside of you,

28:02.474 --> 28:05.686

<i>get the upper hand...</i>

28:05.769 --> 28:07.980
All right, we're out of the parking lot.

28:08.063 --> 28:09.106
Yeah.

28:10.858 --> 28:12.234
I still want it.

28:14.361 --> 28:15.529
Me, too.

28:17.239 --> 28:18.574
Well, there you have it.

28:19.157 --> 28:20.325
(LAUGHS)

28:24.371 --> 28:25.998
Boy or girl? Boy or girl?

28:26.081 --> 28:27.499
-Ma'am?
-It's okay.

28:27.583 --> 28:29.543
-She's my sister.
-It's a girl.

28:29.626 --> 28:31.461
-Oh, thank God.
-(LAUGHING)

28:31.545 --> 28:33.046

<i>of shaking out</i>
<i>to be more</i><i>beautiful than tragic.</i>

28:50.355 --> 28:51.815
Not as good as the lemon thing,

28:51.899 --> 28:53.567
but it's the best
I can do at short notice.

28:53.650 --> 28:55.485
(REBECCA AND JACK LAUGH)

28:55.569 --> 28:56.987
-It's pretty good.
-Yeah.

29:03.202 --> 29:05.078
(CLICKS TONGUE) Come on, George.

29:05.162 --> 29:07.748
Come on. (CLICKS TONGUE)
Come on.

29:07.831 --> 29:10.375
(CLICKS TONGUE)
He was cooped up in a small pasture

29:10.459 --> 29:12.878
with three other horses
before we found him.

29:12.961 --> 29:15.464
You're asking him to be still
when all he wants to do is run.

29:17.424 --> 29:18.550
Come on, George.

29:19.510 --> 29:21.637
Little early to give up on him,
don't you think?

29:21.720 --> 29:24.932
You haven't even given him a chance
to be himself yet.

29:25.015 --> 29:27.643
Whoa. Come on. There you go.

29:27.726 --> 29:29.811
You're getting too tall and too smart.

29:31.522 --> 29:33.482
I got to shower and head to the office.

29:33.565 --> 29:34.566
Okay.

29:34.650 --> 29:36.610
-I love you, honey.
-Love you.

30:00.175 --> 30:01.802
And how are we feeling today?

30:02.511 --> 30:04.555
Same, really.

30:05.430 --> 30:07.266
I'll take "same" every day.

30:10.394 --> 30:12.479
Oh, blood work looks good.

30:13.647 --> 30:15.023
Everything seems...

30:16.608 --> 30:19.778
Sorry. (SIGHS)

30:19.862 --> 30:22.197
I just still can't believe I'm here.

30:23.031 --> 30:24.825
Uh, bulimia.

30:26.243 --> 30:28.328
I didn't have my period for years.

30:30.080 --> 30:32.291
They told me
I'd probably never have children.

30:33.625 --> 30:34.835
Well...

30:35.335 --> 30:37.337
You definitely proved them wrong.

30:41.884 --> 30:43.594
Madison, this is your...

30:44.303 --> 30:46.263
Third appointment alone.

30:47.764 --> 30:49.558
Is there anyone you can...

30:51.185 --> 30:52.895
I haven't told anyone.

30:53.478 --> 30:54.730
I'm, um...

30:55.981 --> 30:59.484
I'm not close with my family, and, um,

30:59.568 --> 31:02.362
I only have one good friend,
and I can't tell her.

31:04.489 --> 31:06.450
I told a barista at Starbucks.

31:07.826 --> 31:09.328
He was not invested.

31:12.706 --> 31:15.417
And the father...

31:16.126 --> 31:18.086
We barely know each other.

31:19.588 --> 31:24.176
Actually, the only thing I definitively
know about him is that he...

31:24.259 --> 31:27.304
Comes from a long line
of great love stories.

31:29.473 --> 31:30.724
And this...

31:32.518 --> 31:34.520
This would not be what he wants.

31:37.481 --> 31:39.191
There's no way he'd...

31:40.859 --> 31:42.861
There's no way he'd want this.

31:47.324 --> 31:49.326
Little early to give up on him.

31:50.619 --> 31:51.828
No?

31:53.121 --> 31:56.041
You haven't even given him a chance
to be himself yet.

32:03.507 --> 32:04.550
Hey, Mom.

32:06.260 --> 32:07.845
Hey, sweetheart.

32:08.470 --> 32:10.556
We were just about to, uh,

32:11.306 --> 32:14.852
show Beth and the girls
Hollywood Boulevard and the, um...

32:16.270 --> 32:17.271
The... The footprints.

32:17.354 --> 32:18.438
-Footprints, yeah.
-Yeah.

32:19.857 --> 32:20.941
Did you get enough to eat?

32:21.024 --> 32:22.276
Uh, no.

32:22.359 --> 32:23.652
Movie stars never get enough to eat, Mom.

32:23.735 --> 32:25.279
-Have I taught you nothing?
-(LAUGHS)

32:26.405 --> 32:27.447
(SOFTLY) Silly.

32:31.118 --> 32:34.746
Mom, you know, I was really surprised
about your announcement earlier. I just...

32:35.455 --> 32:39.126
You... You seemed so adamant
in New York, you know.

32:39.209 --> 32:41.295
No, I... I know. I, um...

32:42.045 --> 32:44.339
I guess when
I really started to think about it, I...

32:45.007 --> 32:48.135
Mmm, I just had
a change of heart, that's all.

32:49.636 --> 32:51.305
It's a big change of heart, though.

32:53.015 --> 32:54.850
I think I just came to...

32:55.392 --> 32:58.520
View it as...an investment in my future.

33:03.901 --> 33:04.902
What did you say?

33:05.277 --> 33:07.779
REBECCA: Hmm? What?

33:09.615 --> 33:10.741
That's what Randall said.

33:11.325 --> 33:12.409
Oh.

33:22.336 --> 33:23.587
Hey, Kevin?

33:23.670 --> 33:25.464
Hey, Rebecca,
what do you say we get out of here

33:25.547 --> 33:26.548
and go see those Hamptons?

33:26.632 --> 33:28.008
-No, I...
-Rebecca.

33:28.091 --> 33:31.553
Let's get Miguel and the girls
and just clear out. Okay?

33:33.847 --> 33:36.350
-Hey, Miguel? Girls?
-Okay.

33:41.313 --> 33:42.648
What'd you say to her?

33:43.649 --> 33:45.025
-Sorry?
-Oh, no. Like hell you are.

33:45.108 --> 33:47.402
What did you say to mom
to convince her to go to St. Louis?

33:48.278 --> 33:50.364
-I have no idea what you're talking...
-Don't do that.

33:54.826 --> 33:56.245
I did whatever I needed to do

33:56.328 --> 33:58.205
to give our mother
the best possible chance.

34:00.624 --> 34:01.667
You couldn't do it, huh?

34:01.750 --> 34:03.502
You just... You couldn't let her
side with me, Randall.

34:03.585 --> 34:04.586
(CHUCKLES)

34:05.337 --> 34:08.465
Did you just say...
I couldn't let her side with...

34:08.549 --> 34:09.550
You know what, man?

34:09.633 --> 34:10.884
-We're not doing this. Yeah.
-No, like hell we're not.

34:10.968 --> 34:12.511
She was clear about
what she wanted.

34:12.594 --> 34:14.513
She was clear, Randall,

34:14.596 --> 34:16.890
that whatever good time she had left,
she wanted to spend with her family.

34:16.974 --> 34:18.600
And whenever that good time
inevitably comes to an end,

34:18.684 --> 34:21.395
Kevin, every one of you will regret
not having fought for more of it.

34:22.354 --> 34:23.397
Don't do it. Don't walk away.

34:23.480 --> 34:24.815
-Randall.
-Hey.

34:26.733 --> 34:27.901
Randall.

34:29.403 --> 34:32.030
-Randall. Hey, hey.
-What, man?

34:32.114 --> 34:33.740
-Man, take your hand off me.
-What are you gonna do, huh?

34:33.824 --> 34:34.825
What are you gonna do, Randall?

34:34.908 --> 34:36.034
I'm not some
out-of-shape purse snatcher.

34:36.118 --> 34:37.202
You gonna sucker punch me?

34:37.286 --> 34:38.370
(DOORBELL RINGS)

34:39.705 --> 34:41.373

to help our mother.

34:41.456 --> 34:43.208
-Okay?
-Yeah. Regardless of what she wanted.

34:51.049 --> 34:52.676
Sorry I'm late for the party.

34:53.177 --> 34:54.845
This is really not
a good time, Madison.

34:54.928 --> 34:56.388
Actually, it's a perfect time.

34:56.471 --> 34:57.931
-I'm taking a walk.
-Randall.

35:01.101 --> 35:02.686
What's going on?

35:03.228 --> 35:04.479
-Where is everyone?
-This is literally

We need to talk, and...

35:12.821 --> 35:14.531
We need to do it now,
before I lose my nerve.

Look. (EXHALES) Just, I'm...

35:17.618 --> 35:20.078

we need to talk about, honestly, okay?

Uh, look, you were lonely.

35:22.664 --> 35:24.333
I get that. I was, uh, heartbroken.

35:24.416 --> 35:26.877
And I don't know why we have to
relitigate the whole stupid thing.

35:26.960 --> 35:29.338
-I just... You know, we made a mistake...
-I'm pregnant, Kevin.

35:32.591 --> 35:34.051
You're the father.

35:37.054 --> 35:38.263
It's the question I would ask.

35:38.347 --> 35:40.766
And...you are.

35:45.646 --> 35:46.813
I'm sorry.

35:48.649 --> 35:50.067
(EXHALES)

35:51.276 --> 35:53.403
I know I am a complete stranger to you.

35:54.363 --> 35:55.864
I am just your sister's friend.

35:55.948 --> 35:59.660
And...I honestly know
nothing about you,

35:59.743 --> 36:02.454
other than how much
you love your high school girlfriend.

36:09.753 --> 36:12.297
I've decided I'm gonna
go through with this.

36:15.676 --> 36:19.930
You don't know my medical history,
but this is kind of a miracle for me.

36:23.642 --> 36:27.062
But I need you to know
I will not ask anything of you.

36:28.438 --> 36:30.524
Emotionally, financially...

36:31.441 --> 36:32.776
All of it.

36:34.027 --> 36:36.029
You can still find
the great love story you deserve.

36:36.113 --> 36:37.114
Madison.

36:44.079 --> 36:45.706
I think I might pass out.

36:46.123 --> 36:47.165
I'm just... I'm gonna...

36:47.249 --> 36:49.751
I'm not walking away
from this conversation, okay?

36:49.835 --> 36:51.753
-I just... I need a minute to...
-Yeah. No.

36:52.254 --> 36:53.255
I'm sorry.

36:53.338 --> 36:54.339
Just...

36:55.591 --> 36:56.758
One second.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

37:15.652 --> 37:17.613
You know what, Kev,
I'm not gonna walk away from this.

37:17.696 --> 37:19.239
-Please, I can't do this right now.
-You think you know

37:19.323 --> 37:20.866
what's best for her
because you spent a day with her?

37:20.949 --> 37:22.618
Because you took her
to a movie premiere?

37:22.701 --> 37:24.703
I think I know what's best for her
because she told us,

37:24.786 --> 37:26.371
-Randall, and you took that from her.
-How dare you, man?

37:26.455 --> 37:27.915
How dare you waltz in here after 40 years?

37:27.998 --> 37:30.292
-How dare... Ah!
-No, no, no. How dare I what?

37:30.375 --> 37:32.211
How dare you pretend
that you give a rat's ass

37:32.294 --> 37:34.087
about what anybody else wants
other than you?

37:34.880 --> 37:36.715
You want mom
to spend more time with the family

37:36.798 --> 37:38.383
because you want
to spend more time with her.

37:38.467 --> 37:40.594
You want mom to decide with you.

37:40.677 --> 37:42.679
-You, you, you.
-Are you kidding me right now?

37:42.763 --> 37:44.139
-This is about me?
-Huh.

37:45.140 --> 37:46.975
This isn't about me, Randall.
This is about you.

37:47.059 --> 37:49.811
It's not about mom.
It's about you wanting to save mom.

37:49.895 --> 37:51.230
-You have no idea.
-That's what this is about.

37:51.313 --> 37:52.731
You have no idea
what you're talking about, Kevin.

37:52.814 --> 37:54.942
You have no idea what it means
to actually take care of people.

37:55.025 --> 37:56.777
Oh, yes. Oh, exactly.
Because I left, right?

37:56.860 --> 37:58.445
Because I left
and you stayed and played martyr.

37:58.529 --> 38:00.822
I stayed, and I took care
of our family, man.

38:00.906 --> 38:02.574
Well, you did a good job
taking care of dad, didn't you?

38:02.658 --> 38:04.785
-What the hell is that supposed to mean?
-You want to do this now?

38:04.868 --> 38:05.994
-Please. By all means.
-You want to do this now,

38:06.078 --> 38:07.079
finally, after all these years?

38:07.162 --> 38:08.413
Let's do it.
You know, this whole narrative

38:08.497 --> 38:11.375
that you keep spinning, this narrative
that you took care of the family,

38:11.458 --> 38:13.085
where the hell did
that come from? Huh?

38:13.168 --> 38:14.211
'Cause all I know is,

38:14.294 --> 38:15.546
-if I had been there...
-Mmm-hmm.

38:15.629 --> 38:16.880
...I would've walked
through literal fire,

38:16.964 --> 38:18.632
and I would've pulled that man out.

38:18.715 --> 38:19.842
Mmm.

38:20.717 --> 38:23.178
Well, Kev, I guess we'll never know
because you weren't there.

38:23.887 --> 38:25.764
And he died ashamed of you.

38:27.558 --> 38:28.600
And I think...

38:28.684 --> 38:31.353
I think that's the part
that really gets you, isn't it?

38:31.436 --> 38:34.398
The shame that he felt for you
and the pride that he felt for me.

38:35.190 --> 38:37.359
I mean, you're not
even chasing dad's shadow, Kevin.

38:37.442 --> 38:38.735
You're chasing mine.

38:39.319 --> 38:41.238
But you'll never be him
and you'll never be me

38:41.321 --> 38:43.407
because you'll never know
what it's like to devote yourself

38:43.490 --> 38:45.409
to anyone other than yourself.

38:46.743 --> 38:48.245
And you'll pretend,

38:48.912 --> 38:50.664
but it'll just be a performance.

38:51.331 --> 38:54.334
A tired, stale performance.

38:55.002 --> 38:57.045
Like all of your performances.

39:04.011 --> 39:05.762
You know, I used to think
the worst thing that happened to me

39:05.846 --> 39:07.306
was the day that dad died.

39:12.978 --> 39:14.479
It's the day they brought you home.

39:16.982 --> 39:18.901
Hand to God, Randall,
the worst thing that ever happened to me

39:18.984 --> 39:20.402
was the day they brought you home.
