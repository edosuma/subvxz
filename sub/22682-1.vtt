01:13.616 --> 01:16.414
- Ma!
- What in the heaven's name?

01:16.486 --> 01:19.455
- It's a letter, Ma, for you.
- Who's it from?

01:21.357 --> 01:24.258
- Aren't you gonna read it?
- Your pa and the boys'll be in soon.

01:24.327 --> 01:27.592
- We might as well wait.
- We'll just have to read it again when Pa gets here.

01:27.664 --> 01:29.655
Oh, please, Ma. It's for you.

01:29.732 --> 01:32.997
You've got a right.
Aren't you dyin' to know what's in it?

01:33.069 --> 01:36.129
Seems to me you're the one that's dying.

01:39.976 --> 01:42.774
"Dragonwyck, May 19, 1844.

01:42.846 --> 01:46.781
My dear Cousin Abigail.
Nicholas Van Ryn."

01:46.849 --> 01:49.443
- Who's that?
- Shh. Tibby.

01:49.519 --> 01:51.851
Read the letter, Ma.

01:51.921 --> 01:55.084
"Though we have never met,
we are related, as you doubtless know...

01:55.158 --> 01:59.117
"through our mutual grandmother,
Annetje Gaansevant.

01:59.195 --> 02:02.164
"My wife and I have decided
to invite one of your daughters...

02:02.232 --> 02:05.030
"into our home for an extended visit.

02:05.101 --> 02:07.763
"We shall naturally be able
to offer her many advantages...

02:07.837 --> 02:11.033
"which she could not hope to enjoy
in her present station.

02:11.107 --> 02:14.508
"In return, if she pleases,
she may serve as a companion...

02:14.577 --> 02:17.375
"to our eight-year-old child, Katrine.

02:17.447 --> 02:21.543
"Upon inquiry, I have been gratified
to find that you and your husband...

02:21.618 --> 02:24.678
"enjoy the honor and respect
of your little community.

02:24.754 --> 02:27.621
"Be so good as to let me know
at your earliest convenience...

02:27.690 --> 02:29.715
"which of your daughters you select...

02:29.793 --> 02:33.285
"and I will make all suitable arrangements
for her journey to Dragonwyck.

02:33.363 --> 02:36.696
Respectfully yours, Nicholas Van Ryn."

02:36.766 --> 02:40.998
Golly! Is he really your cousin?

02:41.070 --> 02:45.006
Now don't go imagining yourselves
a couple of lost duchesses.

02:45.074 --> 02:48.134
There's not a drop of Van Ryn blood
in any of us.

02:50.046 --> 02:53.072
It doesn't make any difference to me,
I'm sure.

02:53.149 --> 02:55.811
But you had the same grandmother.

02:55.885 --> 02:59.912
She was... Let me see.
My grandfather was her second husband.

02:59.989 --> 03:03.015
Her first one died.
His name was Van Ryn.

03:03.092 --> 03:05.755
Nicholas must be his grandson.

03:05.829 --> 03:07.853
He's a patron.

03:07.930 --> 03:10.490
- A patron? Cousin Nicholas?
- What's a patron?

03:10.566 --> 03:14.662
That's what they call the owners of those
enormous land grants on the Hudson River.

03:14.737 --> 03:17.831
They're the descendants
of the original Dutch patrons...

03:17.907 --> 03:20.102
and they're terribly rich and elegant.

03:20.176 --> 03:22.167
He must be very important.

03:22.245 --> 03:25.681
I remember reading about his visiting
President Van Buren at the White House.

03:25.748 --> 03:28.546
But you haven't said yet, Ma,
whether I could go.

03:28.618 --> 03:31.246
The subject hadn't come up yet,
that I know of.

03:31.321 --> 03:35.418
- I think it unlikely that your pa will approve.
- He's more likely to if you do.

03:35.492 --> 03:39.018
And if we do decide to let one of you go,
why not Tibby?

03:39.095 --> 03:41.461
- Me?
- She wouldn't want to go. Would you, Tibby?

03:41.531 --> 03:45.194
I'm sure there isn't anything I want
that I can't find right here.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.930
- I'm not anxious to leave my home.
- That's not fair!

03:48.004 --> 03:50.871
You know I love you and Pa,
all of you, and my home.

03:50.940 --> 03:56.071
It's just that, well, I try to be like everyone else
and want what I'm supposed to want...

03:56.146 --> 04:01.276
but then I start thinking about people
I've never known and places I've never been.

04:01.351 --> 04:04.149
Maybe if the letter hadn't come, I...

04:05.688 --> 04:09.624
Oh, I don't know. I must be loony.

04:09.692 --> 04:12.559
Time I was killing a hen for supper.

04:12.628 --> 04:14.823
You scour the drain boards.

04:14.897 --> 04:19.732
No use mooning over it. Your Pa'll do
whatever he and the Lord think best.

04:19.803 --> 04:22.327
There's one thing you can be sure of.

04:22.405 --> 04:25.102
They'll both feel the same way about it.

04:25.175 --> 04:29.736
This day, O Lord, there has come to me
a matter of slight perplexity.

04:29.813 --> 04:33.680
Deliver us, we pray,
from hankering after fleshpots...

04:33.750 --> 04:37.777
and deliver us from vanity
and false pride.

04:37.854 --> 04:40.254
However, thy will be done.

04:40.323 --> 04:43.724
Keep and preserve us through the night.
Amen.

04:45.261 --> 04:47.593
Well, boys, get.

04:47.663 --> 04:49.654
- Tom.
- Yes, Pa?

04:49.731 --> 04:52.427
You water the stock and look to Whiteface.
She's freshening.

04:52.502 --> 04:55.096
Yes, Pa.

04:55.171 --> 05:00.700
Tibby, is Obadiah Brown likely
to come mooning around again tonight?

05:00.777 --> 05:03.837
Oh, Pa, I'm sure I have
no notion of his plans.

05:03.913 --> 05:06.780
Well, if he does turn up,
be sure and sit on the steps...

05:06.849 --> 05:09.044
where your ma can keep an eye on you.

05:09.118 --> 05:11.712
Although I must say
that Ob is a steady lad...

05:11.787 --> 05:14.382
and you, praise be,
are not the flighty kind.

05:14.457 --> 05:17.392
- Thank you, Pa.
- Now about this letter.

05:17.460 --> 05:21.487
I'd see no reason to discuss it if it wasn't
that your Ma acts like it was important.

05:21.564 --> 05:23.555
It is important, Ephraim.

05:23.633 --> 05:26.067
It might be good for Randy
to live in a great house...

05:26.136 --> 05:28.126
and learn something of the world
outside this farm.

05:28.204 --> 05:31.800
- I'd so like to go, Pa.
- Your opinion is of no consequence

05:31.874 --> 05:36.004
You're past 18, pretty enough, and time
you got settled down with a man.

05:36.078 --> 05:38.478
I don't know what's the matter with you.

05:38.548 --> 05:40.539
As for this fine relation of yours...

05:40.616 --> 05:43.676
I'd like to know what right he's got
to be making inquiries about us.

05:43.753 --> 05:45.983
He doesn't mean it that way, I'm sure.

05:46.055 --> 05:48.250
Perhaps the gentry have different ways
of saying things.

05:48.324 --> 05:52.021
Since when do we have gentry in this country
where all men are free and equal?

05:52.094 --> 05:56.190
A Yankee farmer's as good and maybe better
than any Dutchman on the Hudson River.

05:56.265 --> 05:58.927
- We'll say no more about it.
- Oh, Pa, listen, please.

05:59.001 --> 06:03.700
I have a feeling that the letter was kind
of a sign. I think the Lord wants me to go.

06:03.773 --> 06:05.764
Do you know what you're saying?

06:05.842 --> 06:09.073
During worship tonight,
I had a leading. Truly I did.

06:09.145 --> 06:12.204
At least put it to the test, Pa,
and see what happens.

06:12.281 --> 06:14.373
Are you speaking the truth?

06:14.450 --> 06:16.975
Search your heart.

06:18.119 --> 06:20.145
Very well.

06:24.461 --> 06:26.519
Close your eyes.

06:26.596 --> 06:28.860
Now open the book.

06:39.842 --> 06:42.402
"And Abraham rose up
early in the morning...

06:42.479 --> 06:46.039
"and took bread and a bottle of water
and gave it unto Hagar...

06:46.115 --> 06:50.415
"putting it on her shoulder
and the child and sent her away.

06:50.485 --> 06:55.422
She departed and wandered
in the wilderness of Beersheba. "

06:55.490 --> 06:58.016
Well, it's none too fitting...

06:58.094 --> 07:01.655
but it does seem to have some bearing.

07:03.432 --> 07:06.128
I'll sleep over the matter and pray on it.

07:09.872 --> 07:12.170
Come, Abby.

07:16.879 --> 07:21.680
You know, this is the first time I've ever
known the Lord to go back on your pa.

07:26.756 --> 07:28.747
Golly!

07:30.693 --> 07:33.025
Golly Moses!

08:00.122 --> 08:04.218
It says in his letter for us to meet him
at the Astor House, and this is it.

08:04.293 --> 08:08.286
And a less ft place for God-fearing people
to meet I can't imagine.

08:08.364 --> 08:10.355
Come ahead.

08:15.371 --> 08:18.704
And, uh, what can I do for you,
my good man?

08:18.774 --> 08:20.799
Are you the tavern keeper?

08:20.876 --> 08:23.470
This is not a tavern,
and I am not a keeper, my good man.

08:23.546 --> 08:25.537
I am not your good man!

08:25.615 --> 08:28.049
We were to meet
a Mr. Nicholas Van Ryn.

08:28.117 --> 08:31.177
- Perhaps you can tell...
- Mr. Nicholas Van Ryn? But of course!

08:31.253 --> 08:33.847
- You must be Mr. And Miss Wells.

08:33.923 --> 08:38.621
A thousand pardons. How stupid of me
not to have known at once.

08:43.099 --> 08:45.932
If you will do me the honor
to come with me, please.

08:46.002 --> 08:48.869
Mr. Van Ryn regrets
that he is not here to greet you...

08:48.938 --> 08:51.566
but he has directed that you're
to have everything you wish.

08:51.641 --> 08:53.632
Everything.

08:59.348 --> 09:01.578
- What's all this?
- Dinner, sir.

09:01.651 --> 09:06.180
- I didn't order any.
- Mr. Van Ryn ordered dinner

09:06.255 --> 09:09.918
- Mr. Van Ryn is not here.
- Yes, sir.

09:09.992 --> 09:12.688
Oh, it's beautiful!

09:12.762 --> 09:15.788
The food looks as if it had been painted.

09:15.865 --> 09:17.924
Wouldn't surprise me a bit.

09:21.270 --> 09:23.568
That's the strangest fruit.

09:23.639 --> 09:26.631
It's cold when I eat it
and warm when I swallow it.

09:26.709 --> 09:28.802
Let me taste that.

09:30.846 --> 09:32.973
I thought so. It's got spirits in it.

09:33.049 --> 09:35.643
just a little bit. It's so good.

09:35.718 --> 09:38.778
Even a little bit of evil
cannot be good, Miranda.

09:38.854 --> 09:43.257
Don't be too impatient with me. You won't
have to hear me preach to you much longer.

09:43.325 --> 09:45.452
It's not that I'm impatient, Pa, really.

09:45.528 --> 09:48.827
- But after Mr. Van Ryn went to all this trouble...
- It's no trouble to be wasteful.

09:48.898 --> 09:53.301
And there's something peculiar about a man
who orders supper when he's someplace else.

09:53.369 --> 09:55.462
How did he know what I wanted to eat?

09:55.538 --> 09:58.006
But there's everything here
you could possibly want.

09:58.074 --> 10:00.941
Everything
is what no man should ever want.

10:01.010 --> 10:03.103
Yes, Pa.

10:03.179 --> 10:06.114
We won't be alone much longer, Miranda.

10:06.182 --> 10:08.707
I want you to read with me.

10:23.199 --> 10:25.190
"I will sing...

10:25.267 --> 10:27.497
- "Of mercy and judgment."
- "of mercy and judgment.

10:27.570 --> 10:31.097
"Unto thee, O Lord, will I sing.

10:31.173 --> 10:35.007
I will walk with"...

10:35.077 --> 10:38.137
"I will walk within my house
with a perfect heart."

10:38.214 --> 10:42.708
- "I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes."

10:42.784 --> 10:47.051
"I hate the work of them that turn aside. "

10:47.123 --> 10:51.651
"It sh... It shall not cleave to me.

10:51.727 --> 10:54.287
A forward heart shall depart from me."

10:54.363 --> 10:57.890
"I will not know a wicked person. "

11:00.536 --> 11:03.369
- More coffee, Cousin Miranda?
- No, thank you.

11:03.439 --> 11:05.669
- You, sir?
- No, thanks.

11:09.145 --> 11:11.136
The music is very nice.

11:11.213 --> 11:13.909
I understand they've opened
the dining terrace for public dancing.

11:13.983 --> 11:16.713
It would be fun to watch.

11:16.786 --> 11:20.722
I don't know what made me think you'd
be a much older man, Mr. Van Ryn.

11:20.790 --> 11:23.554
You've mentioned my age
several times now, sir.

11:23.625 --> 11:26.186
Does it affect your confidence in me?

11:26.262 --> 11:30.096
Alexander the Great, when he was younger
than I, had conquered most of the world.

11:30.166 --> 11:32.760
Maybe if he'd been older,
he'd have conquered all of it...

11:32.835 --> 11:35.702
or maybe he'd have had the sense
not to try in the first place.

11:35.771 --> 11:39.832
Aristotle was his teacher, Mr. Wells,
but I'm sure he put things less clearly than you.

11:39.909 --> 11:44.937
- Tell me, young man. What are your politics?
- My politics?

11:45.014 --> 11:49.951
Since Van Buren is a New Yorker, I imagine you
folks up along the Hudson are mostly for him.

11:50.019 --> 11:54.615
Martin's an old friend of mine. Naturally
if he's nominated, my farmers will vote for him.

11:54.690 --> 11:56.715
What do you mean, your farmers?

11:56.792 --> 11:59.693
The tenant farmers on my land.
There are nearly 200 of them.

11:59.762 --> 12:02.425
Never heard of tenant farmers.
Don't they own their own land?

12:02.497 --> 12:05.558
No, it belongs to me.
It belonged to my father and his father...

12:05.634 --> 12:08.534
back to the first patron
that took title in 1630.

12:08.604 --> 12:11.539
I permit the farmers to work my land,
and they in return...

12:11.607 --> 12:14.735
pay me a yearly tribute
and a share of their produce.

12:14.810 --> 12:18.109
But they can buy the land
they've been working if they want to.

12:18.180 --> 12:20.205
- No.
- Why not?

12:20.282 --> 12:22.409
Because it belongs to me.

12:22.484 --> 12:26.978
As a farmer, I'd rather own one half acre
of barren rock free and clear...

12:27.055 --> 12:29.991
than work the richest land in the world
for someone else.

12:30.059 --> 12:33.426
I daresay we don't understand
each other's viewpoint.

12:33.494 --> 12:36.055
I daresay.

12:36.131 --> 12:40.397
Cousin Nicholas, is that the new waltz dance
they're dancing down there?

12:40.469 --> 12:42.494
It sounds very much like one.

12:42.571 --> 12:45.904
It doesn't look improper at all.
Do you dance the waltz?

12:45.974 --> 12:47.909
Miranda!

12:47.977 --> 12:52.108
Yes, Cousin Miranda, I dance the waltz.
But never in a public place.

12:52.181 --> 12:54.172
Oh.

12:54.250 --> 12:59.119
Our politics may not jibe, young man,
but I like your manners.

12:59.188 --> 13:04.023
Well, some good may come to you
out of this venture after all.

13:04.093 --> 13:07.028
I'm glad you think so, sir.

13:07.096 --> 13:11.430
Well, it's time for bed.
Don't forget your prayers, Miranda.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.935
No, Pa. Good night.

13:14.003 --> 13:15.994
Good night, Cousin Nicholas.

13:16.071 --> 13:18.096
Good night.

13:18.173 --> 13:21.472
- Cousin Miranda.
- Yes?

13:21.543 --> 13:24.774
On occasion,
we dance the waltz at Dragonwyck.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.940
Good night.

13:45.534 --> 13:48.628
Agatha! There's Dragonwyck! I can see it!

13:48.704 --> 13:51.605
- Dragonwyck? Where?
- Over there.

13:54.576 --> 13:56.567
Excuse me.

14:06.954 --> 14:09.388
Golly Moses!

14:11.458 --> 14:14.053
Cousin Nicholas! Cousin Nicholas!

14:14.127 --> 14:16.255
I saw it! I saw Dragonwyck!

14:16.331 --> 14:18.697
What have you done with your bonnet?

14:18.766 --> 14:20.927
How can you sit there so quietly?

14:21.002 --> 14:25.029
I should think that seeing Dragonwyck
would be more thrilling to you than to anyone.

14:25.106 --> 14:28.564
Nothing can be thrilling
that is shared with so many other people.

14:28.643 --> 14:31.510
- Did you like what you saw?
- I'm afraid I've run out of words.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.706
I've said "beautiful"
so often this afternoon.

14:33.781 --> 14:36.944
Every now and then you say "golly."
I prefer "beautiful."

14:37.018 --> 14:39.714
I'll try to remember.

14:39.787 --> 14:43.382
Do you mind if I keep my bonnet off
just a minute?

14:43.458 --> 14:46.291
The breeze feels so wonderful
against my face.

14:46.361 --> 14:49.421
Tell me about Dragonwyck.

14:49.497 --> 14:52.557
- How many rooms?
- I've never counted them.

14:52.633 --> 14:55.864
- And lots of servants?
- I've never counted them either.

14:55.937 --> 14:59.737
Golly... I mean, imagine.

15:02.043 --> 15:06.241
The breeze must feel wonderful indeed
with a face as beautiful as yours against it.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.334
Welcome home, Mynheer Van Ryn.

15:34.409 --> 15:36.434
Thank you, Magda. This is Miss Wells.

15:36.512 --> 15:38.503
- Magda's our housekeeper.
- How do you do?

15:38.579 --> 15:40.672
- I assume Mrs. Van Ryn is at dinner?
- Yes, Mynheer.

15:40.748 --> 15:43.308
And you'll be pleased
at how well she's looking.

15:43.383 --> 15:45.477
Not that madam isn't always a picture.

15:45.553 --> 15:49.489
See that Katrine comes to the dining hall.
Will you come this way?

15:49.557 --> 15:52.184
Don't you think
I'd better go to my room first?

15:52.260 --> 15:54.694
I must look hardly presentable.

15:54.762 --> 15:58.857
To my wife, promptness at meals
is the highest human virtue.

16:11.746 --> 16:13.771
You're back.

16:13.848 --> 16:16.180
Yes, as you see, I'm back.

16:16.250 --> 16:19.310
- I didn't know. I would have waited.
- And here is Cousin Miranda.

16:19.387 --> 16:23.050
- Oh, welcome to Dragonwyck, child.
- Thank you.

16:23.124 --> 16:25.854
Will you sit here, Cousin Miranda?

16:25.926 --> 16:28.555
Thank you.

16:28.629 --> 16:32.190
- Did you have a pleasant trip, Nicholas?
- Yes, very.

16:32.266 --> 16:36.531
Miss Wells has had practically nothing
to eat today, Tompkins. Serve her at once.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.629
At once, Mynheer.

16:38.706 --> 16:41.334
I trust you'll be happy here.

16:41.409 --> 16:44.468
It's most kind of you to let me come.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.877
And my mother and father
wish to be remembered.

16:46.948 --> 16:49.041
I'm sure they're most worthy people...

16:49.116 --> 16:52.051
and I'm sure you'll be a good girl.

16:53.654 --> 16:56.487
- Nicholas.
- Yes, my dear?

16:56.557 --> 17:00.357
- You didn't forget the pastries, did you?
- Of course not, my dear.

17:00.428 --> 17:03.261
Oh, those wonderful New York pastries.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.060
- Nicholas.
- Yes?

17:08.135 --> 17:11.262
Did you bring the napoleons,
the honey puffs and the mocha bonbons?

17:11.339 --> 17:17.106
- All of them, my dear.
- I think I'll have the bonbons before going to bed.

17:17.178 --> 17:21.171
Tompkins, serve the honey puffs after dinner,
but be sure they're well chilled.

17:21.249 --> 17:24.343
Yes, madame. And shall we keep
the napoleons for tomorrow?

17:24.417 --> 17:26.717
For my lunch.

17:26.787 --> 17:30.746
After dinner, you'd best go find Katrine.
You might read her a story.

17:30.825 --> 17:34.056
We can hardly ask our guest
to occupy herself with the child tonight.

17:34.128 --> 17:38.065
- She must be tired.
- As you say.

17:42.370 --> 17:44.463
Oh, there you are, pet.

17:44.538 --> 17:46.632
Don't shuffle your feet when you walk...

17:46.707 --> 17:48.732
and you're a naughty girl
to stay away so much.

17:48.809 --> 17:50.743
I never can keep track of you.

17:50.811 --> 17:52.938
- Have you had your dinner?
- Yes, Mama.

17:53.014 --> 17:55.107
This is your cousin Miranda, Katrine.

17:55.181 --> 17:58.151
Hello, Katrine.

17:58.219 --> 18:00.949
It would be courteous to return
her greeting, don't you think?

18:02.456 --> 18:06.721
Katrine and I are going to have
a lot of fun together. Aren't we?

18:06.794 --> 18:09.388
Yes, Cousin Miranda.

18:11.731 --> 18:13.893
May I go now, Mama?

18:13.968 --> 18:15.960
Oh, I suppose so.

18:39.594 --> 18:41.687
Who was she?

18:41.762 --> 18:43.957
She was my great-grandmother, Azilde.

18:44.031 --> 18:48.661
Azilde? That's a strange name.

18:48.736 --> 18:52.934
She looks like... like a frightened child.

18:53.007 --> 18:55.304
I don't know why
we keep her hanging there.

18:55.376 --> 18:58.209
And that ugly, old harpsichord...
It's just an eyesore.

18:58.279 --> 19:02.215
The servants have to be driven to dust it.
You'd think it was going to bite them.

19:02.283 --> 19:04.249
She was from New Orleans.

19:04.318 --> 19:07.809
She and my great-grandfather
were married there in 1743.

19:07.887 --> 19:12.052
Yes, I imagine it was one
of those sudden, romantic adventures.

19:14.294 --> 19:16.763
Tell me some more about them,
Cousin Nicholas.

19:16.831 --> 19:19.163
Azilde and your great-grandfather...

19:19.233 --> 19:21.724
Did they fall in love at first sight?

19:21.801 --> 19:24.498
No Van Ryn does anything at first sight.

19:24.572 --> 19:27.040
But she must have been happy to live here.

19:27.108 --> 19:29.702
As it turned out, it didn't matter.

19:29.777 --> 19:33.372
Soon after their son was born, she died.

19:35.249 --> 19:39.982
She brought this harpsichord with her
from her home. She played it always.

19:40.054 --> 19:43.023
If you listen to the servants,
they'll have you believe she still does.

19:43.090 --> 19:47.493
Fortunately, we don't listen
to servants or to their superstitions.

19:47.560 --> 19:52.224
Oh, no, of course not. I... I...

19:52.299 --> 19:54.392
Isn't it rather late, Nicholas?
Perhaps we should...

19:54.467 --> 19:57.869
I shall stay up for a while,
but if you wish to retire, my dear...

19:57.938 --> 20:00.839
Yes, I... I think I will.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.933
Well, good night then.

20:03.010 --> 20:05.240
- Good night.
- Good night.

20:11.886 --> 20:16.414
I think I have some new music that will please
you more than Van Beethoven, Cousin Miranda.

20:16.490 --> 20:19.357
- You can sing as I play.
- Oh, no, really I can't.

20:19.427 --> 20:22.453
Of course you can.
The lyrics are printed on the sheet.

20:31.739 --> 20:35.539
"I dreamt that I dwelled in marble halls...

20:35.609 --> 20:39.375
"with vassals and serfs at my side.

20:39.447 --> 20:43.544
"And of all who assembled
within those walls...

20:43.617 --> 20:46.780
"that I was the hope and the pride.

20:49.023 --> 20:52.481
"I had riches too great to count...

20:52.560 --> 20:56.825
"could boast of a high ancestral name...

20:56.898 --> 21:01.459
"but I also dreamt,
which pleased me most...

21:02.536 --> 21:04.936
"that you love me still the same.

21:06.240 --> 21:09.472
That you love me still the same."

21:13.814 --> 21:16.510
You read the words with
an extraordinary understanding.

21:16.584 --> 21:18.814
I've never seen them before.

21:18.886 --> 21:24.017
Then perhaps there is someone at home
whom you've promised to love still the same?

21:24.091 --> 21:25.991
Oh, no.

21:29.330 --> 21:32.265
It is getting late.
I'm sure you've had an exhausting day.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.767
I shall have Magda show you to your room.

21:36.337 --> 21:39.431
- Thank you.
- Good night then.

21:39.507 --> 21:41.634
Good night, Cousin Nicholas.

21:41.709 --> 21:43.643
Since we are not really cousins...

21:43.711 --> 21:47.044
I can see no reason why we should
continue to call ourselves so.

21:49.416 --> 21:51.976
Good night, Miranda.

21:52.052 --> 21:53.986
Good night.

22:13.874 --> 22:18.811
- Have you had a pleasant evening, miss?
- Oh, yes.

22:18.878 --> 22:21.643
This is a lovely room, isn't it?

22:21.715 --> 22:24.377
- Yes, it is.
- An unusual room.

22:24.451 --> 22:27.784
- It's unusually beautiful.
- That isn't what I mean, miss.

22:29.323 --> 22:32.554
I do have such a time
making myself understood.

22:34.829 --> 22:38.095
It's what she brought to this room
and what'll never leave it.

22:40.234 --> 22:42.498
Was she very young?

22:42.570 --> 22:44.731
About as young as you.

22:44.805 --> 22:48.638
She must have been very proud
to be mistress of Dragonwyck.

22:51.245 --> 22:55.705
He never loved her.
He never wanted her at all.

22:55.783 --> 22:59.947
He wanted their son.
He kept her from him.

23:00.020 --> 23:02.749
He forbade her to sing and play.

23:02.823 --> 23:05.917
He broke her heart and drove her...

23:09.930 --> 23:13.058
She prayed for disaster
to come to the Van Ryns...

23:13.133 --> 23:17.866
and she swore that when it came,
she'd always be here to sing and play.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.532
She killed herself in this room...

23:21.609 --> 23:23.600
at this harpsichord.

23:23.677 --> 23:26.737
That's just kitchen gossip.

23:26.814 --> 23:30.011
Oh, you mustn't take me seriously, miss.

23:30.084 --> 23:32.712
No one ever does.

23:32.786 --> 23:35.812
May I take you to your room now?

23:35.890 --> 23:37.881
Thank you.

23:45.766 --> 23:48.496
Of course, I've never heard
Azilde play myself.

23:48.568 --> 23:51.094
They say in the kitchen I never shall.

23:51.171 --> 23:54.334
Even when she plays...
I should say if she plays...

23:54.408 --> 23:58.366
you won't either because
you've got no Van Ryn blood.

23:58.445 --> 24:01.243
But he'll hear her. And Katrine.

24:17.164 --> 24:19.257
Is this my room?

24:19.333 --> 24:21.324
Yes, miss.

24:29.476 --> 24:32.309
Will there be anything else
you need, miss?

24:32.379 --> 24:35.041
Oh, no, thank you.

24:35.116 --> 24:37.709
- Well, good night then.
- Good night, Magda.

24:39.586 --> 24:42.111
Miss Wells, why have you come here?

24:43.290 --> 24:45.883
Do you think Katrine
is in need of a companion?

24:45.960 --> 24:49.828
Why, that would be
for her father and mother to decide.

24:49.897 --> 24:53.492
Don't you think Katrine
is in need of a father and a mother?

24:55.402 --> 24:59.600
That was a silly question, wasn't it?

25:04.645 --> 25:07.341
- Do you like it here?
- Of course I do.

25:07.414 --> 25:10.474
Of course you do.
You like being waited on.

25:10.551 --> 25:13.577
I could see tonight it was the first time.

25:13.653 --> 25:16.987
You like peaches out of season...

25:17.057 --> 25:20.720
you like the feel of silk sheets
against your young body...

25:22.196 --> 25:26.064
and one day
you'll wish with all your heart...

25:26.132 --> 25:28.727
you'd never come to Dragonwyck.

25:42.884 --> 25:46.284
I keep getting my S's backwards.

25:46.353 --> 25:49.584
It's very simple,
once you get the hang of it.

25:51.125 --> 25:55.528
Up and then a hook
and then a swing to the left...

25:55.596 --> 25:57.790
and there you are.

25:57.865 --> 26:00.891
Mm-hmm. That's right.

26:00.968 --> 26:04.062
Papa's kind of like a teacher to you,
isn't he?

26:04.137 --> 26:07.574
He's been very kind and helpful to me.

26:07.641 --> 26:09.973
What's he like?

26:10.044 --> 26:11.977
Your father?

26:12.046 --> 26:15.482
Yes. Is he nice?

26:15.550 --> 26:17.847
But of course he is.

26:17.919 --> 26:20.546
Don't you think so?

26:20.621 --> 26:23.283
Does he like me?

26:23.357 --> 26:27.589
Katrine, what a strange thing to say.

26:27.661 --> 26:32.155
Your father and mother
both love you very much.

26:32.231 --> 26:34.257
Did they tell you that?

26:34.334 --> 26:37.133
Why, it's... it's understood.

26:37.204 --> 26:40.332
They love you
just the way you love them.

26:42.109 --> 26:44.134
But I don't love them.

26:52.419 --> 26:55.514
That must be the de Greniers!

26:55.590 --> 26:57.581
They've come for the kermis tomorrow.

26:57.658 --> 26:59.683
They're staying overnight.

26:59.760 --> 27:02.490
The count's
such a funny-looking little man.

27:02.563 --> 27:05.157
It isn't polite to stare, Kat...

27:05.231 --> 27:07.223
Did you say count?

27:13.173 --> 27:15.801
So that's what a count looks like.

27:15.875 --> 27:19.972
So do barons and dukes. Tomorrow
the house will be packed with them.

27:20.047 --> 27:22.709
Papa always has a Fourth of July ball
for the river families...

27:22.783 --> 27:25.183
after the farmers have their kermis.

27:25.252 --> 27:28.744
- A ball!
- You'll have a wonderful time.

27:28.822 --> 27:31.915
And you can wear the ball dress
Papa had sent from New York.

27:31.992 --> 27:34.961
But I won't know anyone
to talk to or to dance with.

27:35.028 --> 27:38.122
Oh, everyone will want
to dance with you, Miranda.

27:38.198 --> 27:40.132
Golly, I hope so.

27:59.219 --> 28:01.813
This is where I hide every year to watch.

28:01.889 --> 28:04.187
Sometimes after Papa leaves...

28:04.258 --> 28:06.249
I go and stand near the carousel.

28:06.326 --> 28:09.625
Perhaps you shouldn't have come, Katrine.
It's wrong to disobey.

28:09.696 --> 28:12.256
Oh, you're just saying that
because you're supposed to.

28:12.332 --> 28:14.926
- Is there anything wrong about the kermis?
- No.

28:15.002 --> 28:17.869
- Could watching it make me a bad girl?
- I suppose not.

28:17.939 --> 28:20.236
Then it's wrong to forbid me to come.

28:20.307 --> 28:22.400
That sounds pretty logical to me.

28:22.476 --> 28:25.104
- Hello, Dr. Turner.
- Hello, Katrine.

28:32.252 --> 28:34.743
- Oh, this is Miranda.
- Wells.

28:34.821 --> 28:37.119
- How do you do, Miss Wells?
- How do you do?

28:37.190 --> 28:40.751
Papa sent for her all the way
from Connecticut to be my companion.

28:40.827 --> 28:43.387
She's a kind of a very distant cousin,
but she's nice.

28:43.463 --> 28:45.988
I had no idea the Van Ryns
ever honored Connecticut.

28:46.066 --> 28:50.093
We're not really cousins, but Mr. Van Ryn
was kind enough to invite me to Dragonwyck.

28:50.170 --> 28:52.161
- Whereabouts in Connecticut?
- Near Greenwich.

28:52.238 --> 28:56.369
- But that's all farm country.
- Sheep and potatoes mostly.

28:56.443 --> 29:00.709
You seem so startled, Doctor. Haven't you
ever met anyone who came off a farm?

29:00.780 --> 29:04.216
Not anyone who came off a farm
to live at Dragonwyck.

29:04.283 --> 29:07.081
This seems like an odd place
for you girls to watch the kermis.

29:07.153 --> 29:10.680
- You'd have more fun over there.
- But we're really not supposed to be here.

29:10.757 --> 29:12.781
We're hiding so Papa doesn't see us.

29:12.859 --> 29:16.386
Katrine had her heart set on it.
You know how children are about such things.

29:16.463 --> 29:19.626
You wanted to see the kermis
even more than I did!

29:19.699 --> 29:21.667
Don't worry. I'll keep your secret.

29:21.735 --> 29:24.794
Papa will never know from me
about... either of you.

29:26.473 --> 29:29.407
May I have the honor
of seeing you again, Miss Wells?

29:29.476 --> 29:33.571
- Why, yes, if you like.
- I would like. And soon.

29:33.647 --> 29:36.674
- If you're sure it won't be too unpleasant for you.
- Unpleasant?

29:36.750 --> 29:40.277
Well, you see, the patron and I
don't get along very well.

29:40.353 --> 29:44.585
In fact, the first thing I've ever known us
to agree on is bringing you here.

29:44.658 --> 29:47.559
I think that was a fine idea.

29:47.627 --> 29:51.027
Well, happy Independence Day.

29:51.097 --> 29:53.029
Good-bye.

29:54.200 --> 29:56.361
Oh, I like him so much.

29:56.436 --> 29:59.803
I wish he could be my doctor, too,
instead of just the farmers'.

29:59.873 --> 30:01.966
Why doesn't he like your father?

30:02.042 --> 30:04.202
Because Papa doesn't like him either.

30:04.277 --> 30:06.745
Why not?

30:06.813 --> 30:08.872
Papa never says why not.

30:10.250 --> 30:12.218
Oh, here they come!

30:34.908 --> 30:37.342
What brings you to our kermis,
Dr. Turner?

30:37.410 --> 30:40.140
Are you expecting an epidemic
of minor injuries?

30:40.212 --> 30:43.239
You never can tell, Mr. Van Ryn.

30:54.094 --> 30:57.188
This chair came from Holland
with the first patron.

30:57.262 --> 30:59.356
It represents, among other things...

30:59.432 --> 31:02.299
over 200 years of extreme discomfort.

31:04.971 --> 31:06.996
The patron is ready.

31:07.073 --> 31:11.372
The first man will come forward,
bringing with him rent and tribute.

31:12.846 --> 31:14.871
Klaas Bleecker, Hill Farm.

31:14.948 --> 31:17.610
winter wheat and...

31:17.684 --> 31:19.777
- You've brought nothing with you, Klaas.
- No.

31:19.852 --> 31:22.753
- Perhaps your crops were poor.
- My crops were all right.

31:22.822 --> 31:24.585
Take your hat off
when you speak to the patron!

31:24.657 --> 31:27.558
I'm a free American citizen!
I take my hat off to no man!

31:27.627 --> 31:31.393
What you do with your hat is your own concern.
Are you ready to pay your rent?

31:31.465 --> 31:35.594
No. Nor will you ever again get
so much as a grain of wheat from me.

31:35.668 --> 31:37.659
It is your purpose, then,
to farm my lands...

31:37.737 --> 31:40.604
and enjoy the privileges I allow you
without making any return?

31:40.673 --> 31:43.574
Your lands?
Did you hear that? His lands!

31:43.643 --> 31:46.806
For 200 years, the Bleeckers
have worked the Hill Farm.

31:46.880 --> 31:49.440
And for longer than that,
it has belonged to the Van Ryns.

31:49.517 --> 31:52.212
We've paid the worth of it many times over,
and you know it.

31:52.285 --> 31:55.517
- Well, here's the finish.
- I'm sorry to hear it.

31:55.589 --> 31:58.921
But since you feel that way, I order you
to leave my land by tomorrow noon.

31:58.992 --> 32:03.053
If you are not gone, I shall have
the proper authorities put you off.

32:03.129 --> 32:06.223
- Have the next man step forward.
- Otto Gebhard.

32:06.299 --> 32:08.290
Won't you reconsider your decision,
Mr. Van Ryn?

32:08.368 --> 32:10.996
Klaas Bleecker, his wife and children
have no home other than his farm.

32:11.071 --> 32:15.565
- Where will he take them?
- I see you've come empty-handed, Otto.

32:15.642 --> 32:17.906
It's his birthright
as a free citizen of a free country.

32:17.977 --> 32:21.674
These men are not alone. The anti-rent
movement has swept New York State.

32:21.748 --> 32:25.184
Take your head out of the sand
and help solve this problem peacefully...

32:25.250 --> 32:27.775
because it's got to be solved,
peacefully or not.

32:27.854 --> 32:29.947
Speak up, Otto.

32:30.023 --> 32:33.982
I'll bring the stuff tomorrow, sir,
if that will suit.

32:35.595 --> 32:38.155
Will the rest of you men step forward,
please?

32:38.231 --> 32:39.857
I have something to say.

32:39.933 --> 32:43.699
I'm tired of listenin'
and talkin' and listenin'!

32:52.679 --> 32:54.840
Klaas just lost his head.
That's all.

32:54.913 --> 32:58.441
He doesn't mean violence any more
than the rest of us. I hope you'll overlook this.

32:58.517 --> 33:02.318
I suppose I must regard what you did
as an effort to save my life, Dr. Turner...

33:02.388 --> 33:06.882
and whether or not I regard you as a meddling
trespasser, I suppose I must thank you.

33:06.960 --> 33:10.521
You've got the facts wrong.
The way I see it, you're the trespasser.

33:10.597 --> 33:13.327
Also, saving your life
wasn't what I had in mind.

33:13.399 --> 33:16.163
If Klaas had killed you,
it would have done these men...

33:16.236 --> 33:18.727
infinitely more harm
than you could ever do alive.

33:18.805 --> 33:20.796
So don't thank me, Mr. Van Ryn.

33:24.977 --> 33:28.641
I shall say a few words about what has
just happened, and they will be my last.

33:28.715 --> 33:32.582
Dr. Turner's efforts to incite
anti-rent rebellion in our local district...

33:32.652 --> 33:35.553
have been well-known to me
for many months now.

33:35.622 --> 33:38.819
just what is it he wants you
to want so passionately?

33:38.892 --> 33:41.553
It has an assortment
of highly romantic names...

33:41.628 --> 33:44.756
the rights of man, life, liberty,
the pursuit of happiness and such...

33:44.830 --> 33:49.233
and all those will be yours
with the titles to a few acres of soil.

33:50.470 --> 33:53.268
Believe me, my welfare
does not depend upon you.

33:53.339 --> 33:55.705
Rather, you depend upon it.

33:55.775 --> 33:59.643
But my rents and tributes
and my responsibilities are hereditary...

33:59.712 --> 34:02.408
the symbols of a way of life
to which I have been born...

34:02.481 --> 34:05.645
and in which I shall continue to live.

34:05.717 --> 34:08.619
I shall never relinquish my position.

34:29.442 --> 34:31.568
I beg your pardon, mademoiselle...

34:31.645 --> 34:34.612
but are you not Miss Wells,
the companion to little Katrine?

34:34.679 --> 34:37.480
- Yes, I am.
- I have not had the honor.

34:37.550 --> 34:39.541
Will you permit me to present myself?

34:39.619 --> 34:43.248
Henri! Henri!

34:56.735 --> 35:00.502
I imagine many parties are
being planned for you and dear Harmon.

35:00.573 --> 35:04.135
Oh, yes. The Dewents
are giving a soiree for us next month.

35:04.210 --> 35:07.510
Everyone will be there.
Simply every... one.

35:07.579 --> 35:09.810
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

35:09.882 --> 35:12.077
May I sit with you?

35:12.151 --> 35:16.087
- We'd be charmed.
- My name is Miranda Wells.

35:16.155 --> 35:20.114
I am Cornelia Van Borden.
My sister, Elizabeth Van Borden.

35:20.193 --> 35:22.182
- Miss Helena Van der Hyde.
- How do you do?

35:22.262 --> 35:25.493
We were just discussing dear Cornelia's
wedding to Harmon Van Brock.

35:25.565 --> 35:27.897
Do you know Mynheer Van Brock,
Miss Van...

35:27.968 --> 35:32.870
Wells. No, I'm afraid I don't.
I don't know anyone here.

35:32.939 --> 35:35.533
Really? Where are you from?

35:35.607 --> 35:38.702
- Connecticut.
- Connecticut? That's in the West, isn't it?

35:38.777 --> 35:41.212
Why, no.
It's right next to New York State.

35:41.281 --> 35:44.216
- My sister means that it's across the river.
- Which river?

35:45.818 --> 35:48.719
The Hudson, of course.
You see, Miss Van Wells...

35:48.787 --> 35:53.349
just Wells.
There are other rivers, you know.

35:53.426 --> 35:55.826
Do you know a city in Connecticut
called Greenwich?

35:55.894 --> 36:00.696
Oh, yes. Very well. I live there.
It's also called Horseneck.

36:00.767 --> 36:04.066
Horseneck? What an incredible name!

36:04.137 --> 36:07.073
It seems ever so much more polite
to say Greenwich.

36:07.140 --> 36:10.576
Well, it's mostly the farmers
that keep calling it Horseneck.

36:10.643 --> 36:13.874
- Tell me, Miss Van Wells...
- Just plain Wells.

36:13.946 --> 36:16.210
How is dear Victoria Schermerhorn?

36:16.281 --> 36:18.306
Victoria Schermerhorn?

36:18.384 --> 36:20.749
You know Victoria Schermerhorn,
of course.

36:20.820 --> 36:25.314
I know of Victoria Schermerhorn, but I'm
afraid I've never met Victoria Schermerhorn.

36:25.391 --> 36:27.382
But you live in Greenwich.

36:27.460 --> 36:32.397
Well, you see, I don't live in Greenwich.
My father owns a little farm just outside.

36:32.465 --> 36:35.901
- Your father is a...
- Is a farmer.

36:38.271 --> 36:40.262
Who is his patron?

36:40.340 --> 36:43.035
There aren't any patrons in Connecticut.

36:43.108 --> 36:45.771
- Why not?
- Because there just aren't any.

36:45.846 --> 36:48.780
- I think that's very odd.
- I don't.

36:48.847 --> 36:53.251
I think my father would rather own
half an acre of barren rock in his own name...

36:53.317 --> 36:55.845
than work the richest land in the world
for somebody else.

36:55.922 --> 36:58.288
You're raising your voice, Miss Van Wells.

36:58.358 --> 37:02.954
It's just plain Wells,
and I'll raise my voice if I like!

37:03.029 --> 37:05.589
What makes you think
you're so much better than I am?

37:05.665 --> 37:09.567
We never said we were. The thought
seems to have originated with you.

37:09.635 --> 37:14.766
And what's more, I never even heard
of Victoria Schermerhorn!

37:22.715 --> 37:27.152
Miss Wells, is there anything
I can do for you?

37:27.221 --> 37:29.415
No, thank you, Magda.

37:29.490 --> 37:31.480
Of course it's only my humble opinion...

37:31.557 --> 37:35.493
but I think you're
the most beautiful lady at the ball.

37:35.561 --> 37:37.655
That's very kind of you, Magda.

37:37.730 --> 37:39.721
All of the servants think so.

37:41.265 --> 37:44.634
I can't understand why
you haven't danced every dance.

37:44.704 --> 37:47.605
But then I suppose most
of the gentlemen are spoken for.

38:10.363 --> 38:12.296
Miranda.

38:13.833 --> 38:17.269
- Good evening.
- Are you enjoying the kermis of the upper classes?

38:17.336 --> 38:19.930
Very interesting to watch...

38:20.006 --> 38:22.531
as if I were visiting a different world.

38:22.608 --> 38:27.238
And I suppose everyone has commented
on your gown and how beautiful you look.

38:27.314 --> 38:30.338
Not everyone.
Do you like it, Nicholas?

38:30.416 --> 38:32.940
- Very much.
- And do you think I'm beautiful?

38:33.019 --> 38:37.012
- The most beautiful lady at the ball?
- Yes, I do.

38:37.089 --> 38:40.752
Thank you. I'm very grateful.

38:45.096 --> 38:48.123
You haven't answered my question.
Are you enjoying the ball?

38:48.201 --> 38:51.830
- I said it was very interesting to watch.
- That's not an answer.

38:51.903 --> 38:53.896
- Well, then no.
- Why not?

38:53.973 --> 38:56.066
You know that answer as well as I.

38:56.142 --> 39:00.099
Because my name is just plain Wells,
and I'm off a farm, and I don't belong.

39:00.179 --> 39:02.807
- That's nonsense. Of course you do.
- I'm as good as any of them.

39:02.881 --> 39:05.077
- Better.
- But it's the wrong river.

39:05.151 --> 39:08.848
I'm not from the top of the Hudson.
I'm from the Connecticut River bottom.

39:10.423 --> 39:12.913
Oh, I've made such a fool of myself.

39:15.928 --> 39:18.260
- Dance with me, Miranda.
- I can't go back in.

39:18.331 --> 39:20.765
It'll be all over the place by now.
They'll laugh at me.

39:20.833 --> 39:22.994
- I doubt that very much.
- But you don't know...

39:23.068 --> 39:26.836
I know that you'll be with me
and that if anyone laughs, we'll laugh.

39:26.906 --> 39:30.739
- Dance with me.
- I'm afraid.

39:30.810 --> 39:34.507
You must never be afraid
of anything with me, Miranda.

40:50.856 --> 40:53.222
Are you enjoying the ball, Miranda?

40:54.327 --> 40:56.318
Well, aren't you going
to answer my question?

40:56.395 --> 40:59.626
I can only think of one thing to say,
and you won't like it.

40:59.699 --> 41:02.497
- Say it anyway.
- Golly Moses!

41:45.711 --> 41:49.544
There's no thunder in the world
like the thunder of the Catskills.

41:49.615 --> 41:53.346
The lightning seems to set
the mountains on fire, and they roar back.

41:53.418 --> 41:58.355
That's all very romantic, I'm sure,
but it doesn't help my cold.

41:58.422 --> 42:00.983
It's never been this bad.

42:01.059 --> 42:03.755
It seems no different
from your usual winter attack.

42:03.828 --> 42:06.821
But we've always closed the manor
in the winter and gone to New York.

42:06.898 --> 42:08.833
Now I'm sick.

42:08.901 --> 42:12.200
If I must be here, why can't I even
have Dr. Hamilton to look after me?

42:16.775 --> 42:19.209
When the storm lets up
and the roads are passable...

42:19.278 --> 42:23.715
The storm lets up!
They never stop in these dreary Catskills.

42:25.784 --> 42:29.584
Come in. What do you want?

42:29.655 --> 42:32.590
Mynheer Van Ryn asked this
be brought to you.

42:38.931 --> 42:41.558
Why, Nicholas,
it's your favorite oleander.

42:41.634 --> 42:43.567
I thought it would brighten your room...

42:43.637 --> 42:46.195
and perhaps make your stay in bed
less unbearable.

42:46.271 --> 42:49.172
Oh, thank you so much.

42:49.241 --> 42:53.507
I can't remember when anything
has pleased me more.

42:53.579 --> 42:57.413
How alive it is, as if it were thinking...

42:57.482 --> 43:01.646
as if it had thoughts of its own
and... desires of its own.

43:06.458 --> 43:08.949
I know how greatly you treasure it...

43:09.027 --> 43:12.052
and I'm all the happier
that you thought to bring it to me.

43:14.334 --> 43:17.303
And I'm happy that you're happy, my dear.

43:17.369 --> 43:19.564
Now I'm sure that you'll want to rest.

43:19.638 --> 43:21.572
- Nicholas.
- Yes?

43:21.639 --> 43:24.905
- You're going to your
tower room again, aren't you?

43:24.977 --> 43:27.969
The servants must think it strange
that you spend so much time up there.

43:28.046 --> 43:31.504
And I find it strange that you should
think about what they think.

43:31.583 --> 43:34.608
- What could you possibly do up there?
- Possibly?

43:34.687 --> 43:38.452
Anything from pinning butterflies
to hiding an insane twin brother.

43:38.523 --> 43:43.119
Actually, I read.
I hope that my explanation satisfies you.

43:43.195 --> 43:47.632
I'm sick.
Haven't you even let Dr. Hamilton know?

43:47.700 --> 43:51.135
Your happiness at the oleander
seems to have faded pretty quickly.

43:51.203 --> 43:55.037
Well, you can't even imagine what it's like
to be sick in this miserable, drab house.

43:55.107 --> 43:58.201
I cannot imagine that Dragonwyck
could be either miserable or drab...

43:58.276 --> 44:02.407
except to those who reflect misery
or drabness from within themselves.

44:11.389 --> 44:13.619
- Mynheer Van Ryn.
- What is it, Magda?

44:13.692 --> 44:17.150
- It's Dr. Turner.
- No one has sent for a doctor.

44:17.229 --> 44:19.322
Turner? What does he want?

44:19.398 --> 44:21.729
He's come to see you.
He says it's most urgent.

44:21.800 --> 44:26.601
My regrets to Dr. Turner.
I am engaged and cannot be disturbed.

44:26.672 --> 44:29.938
- Yes, Mynheer.
- Never mind.

44:40.752 --> 44:43.482
I'm sorry to intrude like this, Mr. Van Ryn,
but it's most important.

44:43.555 --> 44:46.024
- Yes?
- Klaas Bleecker has been arrested for murder.

44:46.090 --> 44:48.651
It's a pity you weren't there
to stop him this time.

44:48.727 --> 44:52.094
I was there. He didn't kill anyone.
It was an anti-rent riot.

44:52.164 --> 44:55.599
Klaas wasn't anywhere near the boy
that was killed, but they blamed it on him.

44:55.668 --> 44:58.501
If by "they," you mean the patrons,
you must also mean me.

44:58.570 --> 45:01.402
The farmers aren't going to stand for this.
They've threatened to storm the jail.

45:01.472 --> 45:03.771
With shouts of liberty,
equality, fraternity, I take it.

45:03.842 --> 45:06.969
just what is it you want me to do, Doctor?
Help my enemy defeat me?

45:07.044 --> 45:10.481
I want your assurance that Klaas Bleecker
will have a fair and just trial.

45:10.549 --> 45:12.540
Let me make my position clear, Dr. Turner.

45:12.617 --> 45:15.244
Whether Klaas Bleecker lives or dies
is of no more concern to me...

45:15.319 --> 45:18.346
than my life was to him... or you.

45:18.423 --> 45:21.187
That seems to be perfectly clear.

45:24.363 --> 45:27.694
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

45:27.765 --> 45:30.256
- Won't you stay for dinner, Doctor?
- No, thank you.

45:30.335 --> 45:33.771
- Miranda, have Tompkins set another place.
- I'd rather not.

45:33.839 --> 45:37.741
Perhaps I spoke a little hastily, Doctor.
I might be able to help.

45:37.809 --> 45:40.676
That's a pretty sudden change of mind.
What brought it on?

45:40.746 --> 45:43.908
I assume that John Van Buren
is to prosecute the trial, is he not?

45:43.983 --> 45:47.042
- Yes.
- He's a close personal friend of mine.

45:47.119 --> 45:50.213
You still haven't told me
what changed your mind.

45:50.288 --> 45:54.452
Dr. Turner, you have my assurance
Klaas Bleecker will have a fair trial.

45:57.628 --> 45:59.994
Now you might do something for me.

46:00.065 --> 46:04.263
Mrs. Van Ryn has a severe cold.
Will you help her if you can?

46:04.336 --> 46:07.794
- Yes, certainly.
- I'll show you to her room.

46:14.879 --> 46:18.680
You'd better take a bit of scraped onion
and sugar for that cough...

46:18.751 --> 46:20.773
and these drops as directed.

46:20.852 --> 46:23.412
- You'll be fine in a few days.
- A few days?

46:23.488 --> 46:26.388
Dr. Hamilton always kept me in bed
for at least two weeks.

46:26.458 --> 46:28.824
He's probably right,
but with most of my patients...

46:28.894 --> 46:31.727
it's all I can do to keep them in bed
while I examine them.

46:31.797 --> 46:35.824
A lighter diet might help...
soup, tea, boiled eggs, less cake.

46:35.901 --> 46:37.869
That's nonsense.!

46:37.936 --> 46:41.133
It's common knowledge that one
should stuff a cold. I'll eat all I please.

46:41.206 --> 46:45.198
Well, you'd get well faster without it,
but you'll get well anyway.

46:46.744 --> 46:48.871
What a beautiful oleander.

46:48.946 --> 46:52.144
I'm relieved to know you find
so little cause for alarm, Doctor.

46:52.217 --> 46:55.242
- It's just a head cold.
- Do you think you could

46:55.319 --> 46:59.347
If you and Miranda will wait dinner for me,
I'll visit with Mrs. Van Ryn.

46:59.424 --> 47:01.618
Yes, of course. Good night.

47:07.365 --> 47:10.061
Dr. Hamilton
usually encourages you to eat...

47:10.135 --> 47:13.662
but then, of course, he has
the tolerance of experience and age.

47:13.738 --> 47:15.728
Turner is young and relentless.

47:15.807 --> 47:20.574
You... You told him you wanted to stay
and visit with me for a while.

47:20.644 --> 47:22.670
What did you mean by that?

47:22.747 --> 47:25.079
Precisely what I said.

47:26.617 --> 47:28.882
just to stay and be with me?

47:29.955 --> 47:33.151
Oh, Nicholas, you confuse me so.

47:33.225 --> 47:37.423
Sometimes when you bring me flowers
and smile at me, I think...

47:37.496 --> 47:42.297
- What?
- That you like me and want me.

47:42.367 --> 47:44.631
- And sometimes...
- Yes?

47:44.703 --> 47:47.229
I feel that you hate me
and would like me to die.

47:47.305 --> 47:49.272
- Nicholas...
- Yes?

47:49.341 --> 47:52.537
Do you think...
Could we go away together?

47:52.610 --> 47:56.046
- Away?
- Alone. Just the two of us.

47:56.114 --> 47:58.105
When I'm well again.

47:59.784 --> 48:02.719
Of course we will, my dear.

48:04.122 --> 48:06.613
As soon as you're well again.

48:06.691 --> 48:08.715
I feel well enough already.

48:08.793 --> 48:12.092
In that case, even Dr. Turner would
approve of your finishing your dinner.

48:12.164 --> 48:15.031
- Shall I bring your cake?
- Yes, thank you.

48:16.767 --> 48:18.860
You know, it's funny.

48:18.937 --> 48:22.430
The day we first met,
last summer at the kermis...

48:22.506 --> 48:24.874
I thought we had very much in common...

48:24.941 --> 48:27.604
and as time went on
we'd have more and more.

48:27.679 --> 48:30.772
But the way it worked out,
frankly, right now...

48:30.848 --> 48:35.411
I don't think you have the slightest idea
what to talk to me about.

48:35.486 --> 48:38.422
It's funny, isn't it?

48:38.490 --> 48:40.822
Would you care
for some sherry wine, Doctor?

48:40.891 --> 48:44.623
- No, thank you.
- I believe I'll have a glass.

48:44.697 --> 48:47.426
Forgive me, please.
We fell to reminiscing...

48:47.499 --> 48:51.333
and it wasn't until Magda came in
that I remembered you were waiting.

48:51.402 --> 48:53.963
We shall dine at once.

48:54.039 --> 48:57.065
Of course, Doctor, you're not to think
of starting back on a night like this.

48:57.142 --> 48:59.133
- You'll stay over.
- No, really, I have...

48:59.211 --> 49:01.701
We'll consider your objections overruled
and the matter settled.

49:41.020 --> 49:43.783
- Katrine.
- Shh.

49:43.855 --> 49:45.846
Why aren't you asleep?

49:45.923 --> 49:49.451
Because I don't want to sleep.
It's so beautiful.

49:49.527 --> 49:53.190
- What is?
- Don't you hear it?

49:53.265 --> 49:57.793
It woke me up.
Such a pretty song from down there.

49:57.869 --> 50:00.633
- You've been dreaming.
- It's a lady.

50:00.704 --> 50:04.505
She's singing
and playing the harpsichord.

50:04.575 --> 50:08.239
- Katrine.
- It's like a lullaby.

50:08.312 --> 50:12.180
But it must be funny,
because every now and then she laughs.

50:12.249 --> 50:16.186
- There. She's laughing now.

50:16.254 --> 50:18.244
Don't you hear it?

50:19.791 --> 50:22.851
It's getting louder and louder.

50:22.927 --> 50:25.361
I don't like it now!

50:25.429 --> 50:30.231
Make her stop! I'm afraid!
I'm afraid! Make her stop!

50:30.301 --> 50:33.930
- Darling, it's no one. Really it isn't.

50:34.005 --> 50:36.940
You must believe me. It's...

50:37.008 --> 50:40.534
Well, I can remember
when I was a little girl...

50:40.611 --> 50:44.412
I used to imagine things so hard
that I thought they were real.

50:44.482 --> 50:48.919
But don't you see, if there were anything,
I'd hear it too.

50:48.986 --> 50:52.855
- It's stopped now.

50:52.924 --> 50:55.256
Of course it has.

50:56.428 --> 50:58.953
It never started, really.

51:00.597 --> 51:02.759
Oh, I'm so tired.

51:06.170 --> 51:07.763
- (Dr. Turner) What is it?

51:07.839 --> 51:10.069
It's Mrs. Van Ryn. She's very sick.

51:10.141 --> 51:14.305
- Tell me, what happened?
- About an hour ago, she woke up

51:14.379 --> 51:17.075
Oh, the pain must have been terrible.

51:17.148 --> 51:22.016
- Magda, what's the matter?
- It's Mrs. Van Ryn. Oh, she was moaning so.

51:22.087 --> 51:24.316
Did she take any medicine
but what I gave her?

51:24.388 --> 51:27.256
- No.
- You'd better send for Mr. Van Ryn.

51:27.325 --> 51:29.315
I have.

52:08.432 --> 52:10.423
Johanna?

52:16.341 --> 52:18.536
Dr. Turner...

52:20.277 --> 52:22.872
I can't understand it.

52:22.947 --> 52:25.781
It doesn't make sense.

52:25.849 --> 52:28.341
Are you sure she took nothing
but those drops I left?

52:28.420 --> 52:30.513
Not while I was with her, sir.

52:30.588 --> 52:33.079
Except for Magda,
no one was with her but me.

52:35.126 --> 52:37.060
I gave her some cake.

52:38.095 --> 52:40.087
Acute gastritis.

52:41.599 --> 52:44.397
It's possible, but I don't believe it.

52:44.469 --> 52:47.461
Is it also possible that she may
have been more ill than you imagined...

52:47.539 --> 52:50.668
when you examined her, Doctor?

52:50.742 --> 52:53.643
Yes, that's always a possibility,
I'm afraid.

53:00.752 --> 53:03.186
See that the pastor
is notified at once...

53:04.288 --> 53:07.417
and have him come to me.

53:15.900 --> 53:18.892
- She's smiling.

53:32.950 --> 53:35.283
I'm sure he didn't mean
that you were to blame.

53:35.353 --> 53:40.290
Whether he meant it or not,
I don't know why she died.

53:40.358 --> 53:43.814
That's shameful, isn't it,
for a doctor not to know?

53:45.295 --> 53:47.354
It's funny the way she ate.

53:47.432 --> 53:51.027
Almost passionately, as if she wanted
from eating what she couldn't have...

53:54.439 --> 53:56.634
You'd better get some sleep.

53:56.708 --> 53:58.573
Good night.

53:59.811 --> 54:01.802
Good night.

54:17.695 --> 54:21.995
I remember how the chapel bell rang
on the day Johanna and I were married.

54:23.301 --> 54:25.792
Tonight it is soft and sad...

54:25.869 --> 54:30.142
but then it was loud and ugly,
and my head ached with the noise.

54:31.642 --> 54:34.009
Johanna laughed
and said it was a heavenly bell...

54:34.079 --> 54:36.741
that would ring for us until death.

54:39.351 --> 54:44.345
We were never happy,
but our life together was tolerable...

54:44.422 --> 54:46.947
till Katrine was born.

54:48.226 --> 54:51.558
Then we knew that Johanna
could have no more children...

54:51.629 --> 54:54.098
that I was to have no son...

54:54.166 --> 54:58.602
that there were to be no more Van Ryns
after me, that I was to be the last.

54:59.905 --> 55:03.033
I... I wish I knew something
that I could say...

55:03.108 --> 55:05.167
that would help you.

55:06.777 --> 55:08.769
I want to so much.

55:10.381 --> 55:13.476
Do you, Miranda?

55:13.552 --> 55:18.854
At an unhappy time like this it must be difficult,
I know, to think of anything else...

55:18.923 --> 55:23.155
but what has happened was
beyond human control, Nicholas.

55:23.228 --> 55:27.288
- You must have faith.
- In God? I intend to.

55:27.365 --> 55:30.061
I must not feel that my life is finished.

55:30.135 --> 55:34.128
And I won't...
as long as you are with me.

55:39.144 --> 55:41.442
The bell has stopped now.

55:41.513 --> 55:43.537
It must be nearly dawn.

55:43.615 --> 55:45.946
Miranda...

55:46.016 --> 55:49.009
you've known as well as I
that this was inevitable...

55:49.087 --> 55:51.521
that we were inevitable.

55:51.589 --> 55:55.583
I didn't know who you were,
or what, or where.

55:55.659 --> 56:00.154
Out of all this world, why should I
have called to you and no one else?

56:00.231 --> 56:03.793
And why should you have come to me
and no one else?

56:04.869 --> 56:07.269
It's because you were meant to.

56:07.339 --> 56:10.638
You knew it the instant our eyes first met,
and everything within us met...

56:10.709 --> 56:12.642
and you know it now.

56:12.710 --> 56:15.473
You have no right to say that,
to talk like this. Please!

56:15.547 --> 56:19.004
- You couldn't help yourself any more than I.

56:19.084 --> 56:22.020
Am I right?

56:22.087 --> 56:24.385
Tell me that I'm wrong.

56:28.059 --> 56:30.789
Forgive me then, if you can.

56:30.862 --> 56:35.526
I had no right to speak as I did,
and you have every reason to be angry with me.

56:35.600 --> 56:37.534
But I had to say it.

56:37.602 --> 56:40.332
There was no way for me not to...

56:40.404 --> 56:43.100
and no one but you to hear it.

56:45.311 --> 56:47.403
Good night, Miranda.

56:52.816 --> 56:55.115
Good night, Nicholas.

57:35.992 --> 57:39.293
- What on earth...
- Miranda, I just heard the news

57:39.364 --> 57:42.596
Why, Jeff Turner, I never thought you'd
go to all this trouble to say good-bye.

57:42.667 --> 57:46.228
- That's just it. I don't want to say good-bye to you.
- But I'm going home.

57:46.304 --> 57:49.637
That isn't what I mean. I think it's fine
that you're going back to your folks.

57:49.708 --> 57:53.610
What I mean is, Greenwich
isn't so very far away after all, is it?

57:53.678 --> 57:55.612
Why, no, Jeff, it isn't.

57:55.680 --> 57:59.241
I was thinking maybe I could come there
and visit you, in a month or so?

58:00.452 --> 58:02.681
Of course, Jeff,
whenever you're passing through.

58:02.754 --> 58:04.585
Would next week be too soon?

58:05.890 --> 58:07.824
Well, I...

58:07.892 --> 58:10.418
I know our relationship
hasn't been exactly...

58:10.495 --> 58:13.053
Well, I've teased you mostly
and sometimes made you angry...

58:13.130 --> 58:17.294
but I've always thought that in time
I could show you how I really felt...

58:17.369 --> 58:19.633
and that maybe...

58:19.703 --> 58:22.069
Miranda, you understand
what I'm getting at, don't you?

58:24.042 --> 58:27.876
- Yes, I think I do.
- I'd like to think that in time...

58:27.944 --> 58:30.505
- Jeff, I...
- I said in time.

58:35.387 --> 58:37.321
Is it that hopeless?

58:40.458 --> 58:42.391
I don't know what to say.

58:43.762 --> 58:46.663
Well, there's...
there's not very much you can, I guess.

58:49.167 --> 58:51.397
Well, have a nice trip.

58:54.038 --> 58:55.972
Thank you, Jeff.

59:31.943 --> 59:36.141
Tom, see that Nat and Seth get to the pump
before they come in the house.

59:47.058 --> 59:49.322
Come inside. I want to talk to you.

01:00:01.239 --> 01:00:04.674
Close that door
and come over here and sit down.

01:00:11.181 --> 01:00:13.275
That was a nice sermon today, Pa.

01:00:13.351 --> 01:00:17.013
Strange you should say that.
Struck me you weren't listening too hard.

01:00:17.088 --> 01:00:21.548
- I heard every word of it.
- Struck me your mind wasn't on it at all.

01:00:21.626 --> 01:00:23.752
Where is your mind?
What's the matter with you?

01:00:23.827 --> 01:00:25.762
- Nothing's the matter, I tell you!
- Ephraim...

01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:28.731
- I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
- If there's nothing the matter...

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.234
You were the first to see.
For months you fretted and worried.

01:00:31.302 --> 01:00:34.396
"Miranda can't sleep.
She won't eat. She can't smile anymore.

01:00:34.472 --> 01:00:37.636
Talk to her, Ephraim!"
All right. I'm talking.

01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:40.337
Since the day you drove in here
in that fancy rig...

01:00:40.411 --> 01:00:43.004
you've been no more one of us
than if you'd never come home.

01:00:43.081 --> 01:00:45.709
- Ephraim, please!
- You hung your fancy outfits in the closet...

01:00:45.783 --> 01:00:47.876
and acted like you never took them off.

01:00:47.952 --> 01:00:51.079
You won't sleep and eat
because your home's not fine enough.

01:00:51.155 --> 01:00:53.419
You won't be happy
because we're not fine enough.

01:00:53.490 --> 01:00:57.154
- That's not true! It's got nothing to do with that.
- What has it to do with then?

01:00:57.228 --> 01:00:59.958
Sometimes when a woman's unhappy,
she just can't talk about it.

01:01:00.031 --> 01:01:02.556
Are you gonna tell me it's a man?
What man?

01:01:02.635 --> 01:01:05.126
She's given frostbite
to every mother's son in the county.

01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:07.067
Perhaps the right one
hasn't come along yet.

01:01:07.138 --> 01:01:11.131
She won't find him with her nose in the air,
wanting what she can't get.

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:14.804
A woman ought to get a man first
and then want him.

01:01:17.715 --> 01:01:20.206
Someone rode in the gate.

01:01:25.223 --> 01:01:29.159
This here's a message for Ephraim Wells,
Esquire, from Weed's Tavern in Greenwich.

01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:32.390
- Who's it from?
- I don't know, but I can tell you how to find out.

01:01:32.463 --> 01:01:34.396
Read it.

01:01:43.441 --> 01:01:46.001
I'll be consarned if this don't beat all.

01:01:46.076 --> 01:01:50.946
Nicholas Van Ryn is stopping in Greenwich
and is coming here this afternoon to see me...

01:01:51.015 --> 01:01:53.710
"on a matter of the greatest importance."

01:01:53.785 --> 01:01:56.515
Cousin Nicholas in Greenwich?

01:01:56.587 --> 01:01:59.386
What in tucket could he want, huh?

01:01:59.457 --> 01:02:01.447
Miranda?

01:02:21.079 --> 01:02:23.570
Mr. Wells, how do you do?

01:02:23.648 --> 01:02:25.582
Nicholas!

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:37.322
just what is the meaning of this?

01:02:37.395 --> 01:02:39.522
May I speak with you alone, Mr. Wells?

01:02:39.597 --> 01:02:42.430
I consider your behavior
exceedingly strange.

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:45.697
On the contrary, it couldn't possibly
be more conventional.

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:52.207
Your Mr. Van Ryn certainly handled Pa.

01:02:52.276 --> 01:02:55.677
- That's enough of that.

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:01.243
What did you think of him, Ma?

01:03:01.319 --> 01:03:03.412
I don't know.
We weren't even introduced.

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:12.861
That was just in the excitement
of the moment.

01:03:12.929 --> 01:03:16.457
He's such a perfect gentleman.
He'd never be impolite to you.

01:03:16.534 --> 01:03:19.298
I'm sure he has fine manners.

01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:22.601
He's... He's come to ask Pa...

01:03:23.975 --> 01:03:26.671
- He wants to marry me.
- I know.

01:03:28.146 --> 01:03:30.205
How do you know?

01:03:30.281 --> 01:03:33.010
Ever since you've been home,
you've never brought his name up once.

01:03:33.084 --> 01:03:36.212
A woman's apt to be that quiet
about a man she loves.

01:03:36.286 --> 01:03:38.812
Besides, you've ironed that dress
every week now for two months.

01:03:38.890 --> 01:03:40.824
Oh.

01:03:42.994 --> 01:03:46.486
- Miranda, child...
- Yes, Ma?

01:03:49.133 --> 01:03:51.567
Do you love him very much?

01:03:52.637 --> 01:03:55.333
Of course I do.

01:03:55.406 --> 01:03:59.109
- Are you sure?
- Why do you ask that?

01:04:00.176 --> 01:04:02.269
It's just...

01:04:02.345 --> 01:04:04.745
Maybe I shouldn't have let you go.

01:04:04.814 --> 01:04:08.147
Maybe Dragonwyck should have stayed
something to read about and dream about.

01:04:08.218 --> 01:04:12.017
My dreams came true, Ma.
Can't you see?

01:04:12.088 --> 01:04:15.284
Ever since I was a little girl
and built a castle in an apple tree.

01:04:15.358 --> 01:04:17.985
But you can't marry a dream, Miranda.

01:04:19.062 --> 01:04:21.530
What about him? Do you love him?

01:04:21.597 --> 01:04:25.763
But it's all Nicholas.
Nicholas is all of it.

01:04:31.074 --> 01:04:33.338
You're acting so strangely...

01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:36.673
almost as if you were afraid.

01:04:36.745 --> 01:04:38.839
Miranda.! Abigail.! Come on in here.

01:04:55.964 --> 01:04:58.057
Says he wants to marry you.

01:04:58.134 --> 01:05:01.500
- Says you know all about it.
- Yes, Pa.

01:05:01.571 --> 01:05:04.302
Have you considered
that your mother and I might object?

01:05:04.374 --> 01:05:08.002
I have already pointed out to your father
that there are no valid objections.

01:05:08.077 --> 01:05:12.775
And I've already pointed out to you, sir,
that I'll make up my own mind!

01:05:12.848 --> 01:05:14.874
What do you think, Abby?

01:05:14.951 --> 01:05:18.182
I don't think thinking has anything
to do with it anymore, Ephraim.

01:05:18.253 --> 01:05:20.745
It's something that is,
and we must make the best of it.

01:05:20.823 --> 01:05:23.917
I want to apologize for my rudeness
when I entered your house.

01:05:23.992 --> 01:05:26.087
My only excuse is that I saw nothing...

01:05:26.162 --> 01:05:28.426
and wanted to see nothing
but Miranda at that moment.

01:05:28.498 --> 01:05:32.399
I can understand that, Mr. Van Ryn.
You're forgiven.

01:05:32.468 --> 01:05:35.198
Thank you.

01:05:35.271 --> 01:05:37.763
You should know that I have already
called at your parsonage...

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:40.900
and engaged the Reverend Clark
to be here tomorrow afternoon at 3:00.

01:05:40.977 --> 01:05:43.673
- Tomorrow?
- It's indecent! It's too soon!

01:05:43.746 --> 01:05:46.442
I want my girl married
in a church like a good Christian.

01:05:46.516 --> 01:05:50.509
- I'll have no hole-and-corner wedding here!
- She has no wedding gown.

01:05:50.586 --> 01:05:53.522
For once we will let the ceremony
outshine the costume.

01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:57.116
Whatever dress Miranda wears will be
forever cherished as her wedding gown.

01:05:57.192 --> 01:05:59.923
Hmm. Got a lot of pretty words.

01:05:59.995 --> 01:06:02.521
Too many for me.

01:06:02.599 --> 01:06:07.161
Miranda, you've got plenty at stake here.
You'd better say something.

01:06:08.503 --> 01:06:11.064
I'll do whatever Nicholas thinks best.

01:06:12.376 --> 01:06:14.468
So be it.

01:06:14.543 --> 01:06:16.876
Amen, Mr. Wells.

01:06:16.946 --> 01:06:20.905
Now I must return to Greenwich.
Miranda, will you walk with me to my carriage?

01:06:20.984 --> 01:06:23.886
Until tomorrow then. Good-bye.

01:07:04.993 --> 01:07:08.953
- MacNab, which carriage
have you sent to meet Mr. Van Ryn?

01:07:09.033 --> 01:07:12.023
- Have the grooms their new uniforms?
- Yes, madam.

01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:15.093
- Here are the menus for the week.
- Thank you, madam.

01:07:15.171 --> 01:07:19.231
And, Mrs. MacNab, I've just written
Miss Katrine that we've found her doll.

01:07:19.309 --> 01:07:22.836
Please be sure that it's packed carefully.
I wouldn't want anything to happen to it.

01:07:22.911 --> 01:07:26.678
Certainly, madam.

01:07:28.618 --> 01:07:30.847
We'll let the linen room go
until this afternoon.

01:07:30.919 --> 01:07:33.013
Perhaps you should let it go
until tomorrow, madam...

01:07:33.089 --> 01:07:35.556
what with Mr. Van Ryn
coming back... and everything.

01:07:36.859 --> 01:07:38.792
I won't overdo it.

01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:42.592
And remember, not a word
to Mr. Van Ryn about... everything.

01:07:42.665 --> 01:07:45.896
- I want to be the one to tell him.
- Of course, madam.

01:07:51.707 --> 01:07:53.869
Welcome back, sir.
How did you find New York?

01:07:53.943 --> 01:07:56.571
Unbearable.
Thank you, Mrs. MacNab.

01:07:56.646 --> 01:07:58.580
Nicholas!

01:08:00.283 --> 01:08:03.410
How lovely you are.
I'd almost forgotten how lovely you are.

01:08:03.486 --> 01:08:05.716
I'm not. When you're not with me,
I'm not anything.

01:08:05.787 --> 01:08:08.188
Three long weeks...
Have you missed me? Have you been well?

01:08:08.257 --> 01:08:10.419
I missed you terribly.

01:08:10.493 --> 01:08:13.621
And everything has been just fine.

01:08:13.696 --> 01:08:16.323
- As a matter of fact...
- I'm having our townhouse entirely redone.

01:08:16.398 --> 01:08:19.594
A new music room... We must plan a series
of entertainments for the winter season.

01:08:19.667 --> 01:08:21.761
Mrs. MacNab said I'd find you here.

01:08:21.837 --> 01:08:25.001
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I didn't know.

01:08:25.073 --> 01:08:28.770
That's all right, Peggy. This is Mr. Van Ryn.
Was it anything important?

01:08:28.844 --> 01:08:32.906
Well, it was just to remind you that you ate
none of your breakfast this morning.

01:08:32.981 --> 01:08:35.073
And all of your favorite dishes too.

01:08:35.151 --> 01:08:37.551
We won't talk about food,
if you don't mind.

01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:40.109
You'll eat every bite of your lunch,
or there'll be talk!

01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:42.282
You carry on
as if you'd cooked it yourself.

01:08:42.357 --> 01:08:44.349
Me? I couldn't cook the bottom of a pan.

01:08:44.425 --> 01:08:47.397
But she managed to burn
my best Indian muslin negligee.

01:08:47.462 --> 01:08:50.091
That I did.
Me ironin' is worse than me cookin'.

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:52.794
She ruined it completely when she
tried to sew it together again.

01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:56.633
True. Me sewin' is even
more horrible than me ironin'.

01:08:56.705 --> 01:09:00.107
What would I be wanting with
a greenhorn like you? Can you tell me?

01:09:00.175 --> 01:09:03.941
That I can't.
But you'll eat your lunch just the same.

01:09:07.817 --> 01:09:10.046
And what was that strange little creature?

01:09:10.118 --> 01:09:12.279
That was Peggy, Peggy O'Malley.

01:09:12.354 --> 01:09:16.256
- I assumed it had a name.
What was it doing here?

01:09:16.325 --> 01:09:18.314
Your maid, that untidy little cripple?

01:09:18.393 --> 01:09:21.453
She's not untidy,
and her leg's no fault of hers.

01:09:21.529 --> 01:09:25.296
- She's had a miserable life.
- That's the strangest

01:09:25.366 --> 01:09:28.926
She's bright and willing and good to me,
and I want her as my maid.

01:09:29.005 --> 01:09:31.836
I shall have MacNab give her
some extra money and a good character.

01:09:31.907 --> 01:09:34.001
It's so little to ask. Please, Nicholas!

01:09:35.077 --> 01:09:36.874
Deformed bodies depress me.

01:09:38.947 --> 01:09:42.179
Perhaps I can divert
your attention with this.

01:09:42.251 --> 01:09:44.844
I brought it for you
from Mr. Tiffany's new shop.

01:09:46.321 --> 01:09:49.689
- How dare you say that.
- How dare I?

01:09:49.759 --> 01:09:52.921
You speak as if a crippled leg
were a weakness on her part...

01:09:52.996 --> 01:09:56.089
rather than merely God's will.

01:09:58.502 --> 01:10:00.766
We'll agree, then, it is God's will.

01:10:00.836 --> 01:10:05.434
Now perhaps we can discuss your plans for
the kermis ball. Are they progressing nicely?

01:10:05.507 --> 01:10:09.467
Madame Duclos swore to me that your gown
will be finished and delivered to you in time.

01:10:09.544 --> 01:10:12.912
She needn't overwork herself.

01:10:12.981 --> 01:10:16.712
- It's very likely I won't need it at all.
- What do you mean?

01:10:16.788 --> 01:10:21.189
- The Van Bordens sent their regrets yesterday.
- Their regrets?

01:10:21.256 --> 01:10:25.660
A previous engagement or some illness
in the family. I forget what excuse they used.

01:10:25.728 --> 01:10:29.129
- I see.
- That makes the eighth refusal in four days.

01:10:29.198 --> 01:10:34.260
It's only because of me...
because you married me.

01:10:35.538 --> 01:10:37.472
Miranda...

01:10:38.707 --> 01:10:41.006
you are Mrs. Nicholas Van Ryn.

01:10:41.078 --> 01:10:44.637
You will be with me wherever I am, always.

01:10:46.882 --> 01:10:49.146
Luncheon is served.

01:10:49.218 --> 01:10:51.277
Thank you, MacNab.

01:10:54.756 --> 01:10:57.749
- Nicholas...
- Yes?

01:10:57.828 --> 01:11:01.160
Sometimes I think that they...
that we...

01:11:01.229 --> 01:11:03.165
That we what?

01:11:03.231 --> 01:11:07.396
I think about that night...
the night she died.

01:11:12.674 --> 01:11:16.338
- What about that night?
- It was so soon after...

01:11:16.412 --> 01:11:18.504
Perhaps we should have
waited to decide.

01:11:18.582 --> 01:11:21.572
In the hope that our gossip-mongering
neighbors would be more approving?

01:11:21.650 --> 01:11:23.642
I don't care whether they know, Nicholas!

01:11:23.719 --> 01:11:27.280
It's just that we do, and so does God.

01:11:27.356 --> 01:11:29.688
I've never heard you speak
so childishly, Miranda.

01:11:29.759 --> 01:11:32.057
You might well be
on your father's knee.

01:11:32.128 --> 01:11:36.086
Do you believe there is a God who spends
eternity snooping on human behavior...

01:11:36.166 --> 01:11:38.895
and punishing all violators
of the pastor's latest sermon?

01:11:38.967 --> 01:11:41.493
- That's not what I mean at all!
- Then what do you mean?

01:11:41.569 --> 01:11:44.300
Well... Well, I believe that...

01:11:44.373 --> 01:11:47.935
God has put a sense of right and wrong
within all of us...

01:11:48.009 --> 01:11:53.243
and that when we do wrong,
no matter if no one else knows, we do.

01:11:53.314 --> 01:11:56.945
You've remembered that ever since
your Sunday school days, haven't you?

01:11:57.019 --> 01:12:00.921
That's a good girl.
Now let us enjoy our luncheon.

01:12:00.989 --> 01:12:04.756
Nicholas,
you do believe in God?

01:12:04.827 --> 01:12:08.786
I believe in myself,
and I am answerable to myself.

01:12:08.863 --> 01:12:12.766
I will not live according to printed mottos
like the directions on a medicine bottle.

01:12:40.931 --> 01:12:43.022
Would you like me to say grace?

01:12:44.365 --> 01:12:46.859
That won't be necessary.

01:12:46.936 --> 01:12:49.426
Then I shall begin our salad dressing.

01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:25.974
What possible excuse can you have
for humiliating me like that?

01:13:26.044 --> 01:13:28.477
Miranda, what is the matter with you?

01:13:28.544 --> 01:13:31.137
- I believe in God!
- It is your privilege. I have no intention...

01:13:31.212 --> 01:13:33.509
And so will my child believe in him!

01:13:35.085 --> 01:13:38.747
- Miranda.
- I will pray to God to make him

01:13:38.821 --> 01:13:42.382
- Miranda, is it true?
- Yes, are you glad?

01:13:42.459 --> 01:13:45.153
Now may I have Peggy as a reward,
if nothing else?

01:13:45.227 --> 01:13:47.560
Have I done something
to please you at last?

01:13:58.808 --> 01:14:01.673
Listen to 'em. They're celebratin'.

01:14:01.744 --> 01:14:04.871
I'm gonna celebrate too and get drunk.

01:14:04.947 --> 01:14:08.074
john Young's our new governor,
and the farmers of New York State...

01:14:08.150 --> 01:14:10.584
have got a right to celebrate
and get drunk.

01:14:10.652 --> 01:14:14.611
Hand me up my ancestral chair.

01:14:19.193 --> 01:14:21.287
There you are!

01:14:22.698 --> 01:14:27.103
Take off your heads
in the presence of the poltroon.

01:14:31.505 --> 01:14:36.308
Tom Wilson, come forward, bringing
all your money and all your crops...

01:14:36.377 --> 01:14:40.780
and thank the good, kind poltroon
for taking 'em off your hands.

01:14:43.186 --> 01:14:45.278
I don't have to no more!

01:14:45.354 --> 01:14:48.481
john Young is the governor
and the constitution's been changed.

01:14:48.557 --> 01:14:51.856
I can buy my farm. It's the law!

01:15:09.145 --> 01:15:11.840
Dr. Turner, will you come with me
at once to Dragonwyck?

01:15:11.914 --> 01:15:14.404
- We need you urgently.
- Is anything wrong?

01:15:14.483 --> 01:15:16.974
Mrs. Van Ryn is having a baby.
Her time is here.

01:15:17.051 --> 01:15:20.282
Dr. William Brown has been staying at
the manor. I had him come from New York.

01:15:20.355 --> 01:15:24.018
- He's a fine doctor...
- He's a fool. I beg you to come.

01:15:24.091 --> 01:15:26.822
Have you any reason
to think she's in danger?

01:15:26.896 --> 01:15:30.456
Mrs. Van Ryn? I don't know that she...

01:15:30.532 --> 01:15:32.831
Doctor, nothing must happen to my son.

01:15:34.569 --> 01:15:36.502
All right.

01:15:45.247 --> 01:15:48.183
She's been took bad,
and they won't let me near her.

01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:50.547
Please let me go to her.

01:15:57.326 --> 01:15:59.453
What is it, Dr. Brown?
What has happened?

01:15:59.527 --> 01:16:01.996
Everything's quite all right,
Mr. Van Ryn. Quite, quite.

01:16:02.064 --> 01:16:04.032
- Are you certain?
- I assure you.

01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:06.158
I want you to take every precaution...

01:16:06.234 --> 01:16:09.030
Mr. Van Ryn, would you step out
while I consult with Dr. Brown?

01:16:09.105 --> 01:16:13.473
- I can see no reason...
- Your presence here can only

01:16:17.378 --> 01:16:20.371
Dr. Turner, thank heaven you've come.

01:16:20.448 --> 01:16:23.212
I can't assume
this responsibility alone any longer.

01:16:23.285 --> 01:16:26.517
The man's a maniac.
I think he'd kill me if anything went wrong.

01:16:26.587 --> 01:16:29.989
- Nonsense.
- My dear fellow, you just don't know.

01:16:30.058 --> 01:16:33.516
When I tried to resign from the case,
he had me locked in my room!

01:16:33.595 --> 01:16:36.324
He watches me all the time
through those icy eyes of his.

01:16:36.397 --> 01:16:38.389
Sometimes I think
he's mesmerizing me.

01:16:38.467 --> 01:16:40.458
- Have you been giving her laudanum?
- Yes.

01:16:40.535 --> 01:16:42.662
As far as she is concerned,
everything's quite normal.

01:16:42.738 --> 01:16:45.206
There is an irregularity
in the child's heartbeat.

01:16:45.272 --> 01:16:47.707
But it's sometimes hard to catch
through the stethoscope.

01:16:47.774 --> 01:16:52.109
Yes, it often is. I'll wait until
she wakes a little before I examine her.

01:16:52.181 --> 01:16:54.545
In the meantime,
why don't you get some rest?

01:16:54.615 --> 01:16:58.279
If you'll take over for a while.
My room is just down the corridor.

01:16:58.353 --> 01:17:00.685
I will call you if you're needed,
and don't worry.

01:17:00.756 --> 01:17:02.814
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

01:17:13.535 --> 01:17:17.437
- Jeff..
- Hello there.

01:17:17.506 --> 01:17:21.066
I don't know
whether to believe this or not.

01:17:21.144 --> 01:17:23.634
You can believe it.

01:17:23.711 --> 01:17:26.477
Are you going to take care of me now?

01:17:26.548 --> 01:17:30.609
Yes, I'm going to take care of you now.

01:17:31.719 --> 01:17:34.314
That's good.

01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:36.481
It's... I...

01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:40.426
It'll be all right now.

01:17:42.498 --> 01:17:45.694
I'm not afraid anymore.

01:17:46.768 --> 01:17:48.701
Jeff!

01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:50.760
Don't be afraid.

01:17:50.838 --> 01:17:53.136
Call Dr. Brown.

01:17:53.208 --> 01:17:56.541
Jeff, help me.

01:18:00.015 --> 01:18:02.505
I'll always help you.

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.699
Mr. Van Ryn,
there's something you must know.

01:18:22.769 --> 01:18:25.001
Your son is not well.

01:18:25.073 --> 01:18:30.238
I can't tell you how sorry I am, but at least
your wife has come through beautifully...

01:18:30.313 --> 01:18:33.042
and in time there's no reason
why you can't have other babies.

01:18:33.114 --> 01:18:35.845
My son is entirely well, Dr. Turner.

01:18:35.917 --> 01:18:40.080
I appreciate your services,
and you will be suitably recompensed.

01:18:40.155 --> 01:18:43.124
But he can't live.
His heart is malformed.

01:18:43.191 --> 01:18:45.682
It's a miracle he wasn't stillborn.

01:18:45.759 --> 01:18:49.923
It's nobody's fault. Nothing could have
prevented it. It's just a tragic accident.

01:18:49.999 --> 01:18:53.398
You will find a carriage
waiting to take you to your home.

01:18:56.372 --> 01:18:59.306
You just won't face facts, will you?

01:18:59.374 --> 01:19:01.934
You'll never believe anything
you don't want to.

01:19:07.183 --> 01:19:10.174
And there is no reason for you
to see Mrs. Van Ryn again.

01:19:10.252 --> 01:19:12.243
Good day, Doctor.

01:19:19.261 --> 01:19:21.751
Adriaen Pieter Van Ryn...

01:19:21.831 --> 01:19:26.528
I baptize thee
in the name of the Father...

01:19:26.601 --> 01:19:30.537
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

01:19:31.605 --> 01:19:33.436
Amen.

01:19:37.178 --> 01:19:40.112
We yield thee hearty thanks,
Most Merciful Father...

01:19:40.182 --> 01:19:44.448
that it hath pleased thee to regenerate
this infant for thy Holy Spirit...

01:19:44.519 --> 01:19:47.544
to receive him
for thine own child by adoption...

01:19:47.621 --> 01:19:50.385
and to incorporate him
into thy holy church.

01:19:50.458 --> 01:19:52.392
Amen.

01:19:54.462 --> 01:19:58.364
Please accept my most sincere
congratulations, Mynheer Van Ryn.

01:19:58.433 --> 01:20:00.697
Thank you, dominie.
You understand, of course...

01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:04.536
that this house ceremony was only
at the insistence of Mrs. Van Ryn.

01:20:04.606 --> 01:20:08.872
In a month or two, my son will be properly
baptized in the Dragonwyck church.

01:20:08.943 --> 01:20:10.740
- Of course...
- No, Nicholas.

01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:16.680
We can thank God
that he was baptized just in time.

01:20:42.445 --> 01:20:45.173
Please, don't leave her now. Please!

01:20:45.247 --> 01:20:49.513
Loathsome little cripple. Why should you
have been permitted to live and not my son?

01:21:13.173 --> 01:21:15.166
Should I light some candles?

01:21:15.243 --> 01:21:17.609
No, I like to sit here in this half-dark.

01:21:17.678 --> 01:21:20.147
You'll ruin your eyes.

01:21:22.884 --> 01:21:27.446
- How long has he been up there this time?
- A week. Perhaps more.

01:21:27.522 --> 01:21:29.989
Ever since he got back from New York.
And before that...

01:21:30.058 --> 01:21:32.150
I'm sure it isn't
very pleasant for him, Peggy.

01:21:32.227 --> 01:21:34.627
And what is it for you?

01:21:34.695 --> 01:21:37.392
Shut up there for weeks on end
without a word or a sound.

01:21:37.465 --> 01:21:41.334
If it was any man but him, I'd say he keeps
a bottle up there in that tower room.

01:21:41.402 --> 01:21:44.099
- Peggy!
- Yes, ma'am.

01:21:57.452 --> 01:21:59.386
- I'm going with you.
- Don't be silly.

01:21:59.455 --> 01:22:01.546
- I'll not let you go up there alone.
- That's enough.

01:22:01.624 --> 01:22:03.613
Please don't. I'm afraid!

01:22:59.347 --> 01:23:01.440
Oh, it's you.

01:23:01.516 --> 01:23:03.609
Yes, Nicholas.

01:23:08.523 --> 01:23:10.458
I...

01:23:11.826 --> 01:23:14.316
This is an unlooked-for pleasure.

01:23:14.395 --> 01:23:16.387
I wasn't expecting you.

01:23:18.465 --> 01:23:21.628
Frankly, I'd almost succeeded
in forgetting you.

01:23:23.037 --> 01:23:25.027
Don't be frightened of me.

01:23:25.106 --> 01:23:27.370
I'm not frightened.

01:23:27.442 --> 01:23:29.537
I'm sure you're not.

01:23:29.610 --> 01:23:32.876
You have courage, Miranda.
I like that about you.

01:23:32.947 --> 01:23:38.714
Must've taken a great deal to make this
pilgrimage up to the mysterious tower room.

01:23:38.789 --> 01:23:43.726
I assume your twisted little friend is offering up
suitable prayers for your safe return?

01:23:43.791 --> 01:23:47.386
I see no reason
why they should be necessary.

01:23:47.462 --> 01:23:49.931
Tell me, are you disappointed
in what you found here?

01:23:49.999 --> 01:23:53.126
I'm sure you expected
velvet drapes and heathen idols...

01:23:53.201 --> 01:23:55.830
an altar for human sacrifice at least.

01:23:55.903 --> 01:23:58.337
Nicholas, what do you do here?

01:23:59.407 --> 01:24:01.501
What do I do?

01:24:08.184 --> 01:24:10.709
I live.

01:24:10.785 --> 01:24:13.948
I'm sure you mean
a great deal by that, but...

01:24:14.022 --> 01:24:16.081
but it isn't very clear to me.

01:24:16.156 --> 01:24:19.489
I didn't expect you to understand.
How could you?

01:24:19.561 --> 01:24:23.998
Don't be offended. By ordinary standards,
you're quite intelligent.

01:24:24.065 --> 01:24:26.659
But I will not live by ordinary standards.

01:24:26.734 --> 01:24:29.134
I will not run with the pack.

01:24:29.205 --> 01:24:33.768
I will not be chained into a routine of living
which is the same for others.

01:24:33.842 --> 01:24:38.643
I will not look to the ground
and move on the ground with the rest...

01:24:38.713 --> 01:24:42.878
not so long as there are those
mountaintops and clouds...

01:24:42.951 --> 01:24:45.044
and limitless space.

01:24:48.289 --> 01:24:51.416
I'm sure you are still unable
to understand.

01:24:51.494 --> 01:24:53.586
I want to try, if you'll help me.

01:24:53.661 --> 01:24:57.619
Shall I? Shall I tell you
what you want to know?

01:24:57.698 --> 01:24:59.632
Brace yourself.

01:24:59.701 --> 01:25:02.727
Prepare to have your God-fearing,
farm-bred prayer-fattened morality...

01:25:02.804 --> 01:25:05.238
shaken to its core!

01:25:07.174 --> 01:25:11.907
You see, I have become what is
vulgarly known as a... drug addict.

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:15.214
Why?

01:25:15.282 --> 01:25:20.846
No tearful reproaches?
No attempts to save me, to regenerate me?

01:25:20.922 --> 01:25:23.516
Why do you find it necessary?

01:25:23.589 --> 01:25:27.459
That is what you could not
hope to comprehend.

01:25:27.528 --> 01:25:31.624
It is because I have set free
something within me...

01:25:31.697 --> 01:25:34.463
something that, ever since I can remember,
has been like a rock...

01:25:34.536 --> 01:25:37.231
caught in my heart, in my brain...

01:25:37.306 --> 01:25:40.137
pushing at me, choking me.

01:25:47.849 --> 01:25:50.340
I know you better than you think.

01:25:54.022 --> 01:25:56.584
Perhaps I have underestimated
your intelligence.

01:25:56.657 --> 01:25:59.717
No. It's pretty ordinary and farm-bred.

01:25:59.794 --> 01:26:03.627
I couldn't follow everything you said,
but I think it's pretty simple.

01:26:03.697 --> 01:26:06.224
You're just plain running away.

01:26:06.301 --> 01:26:08.793
Is it as simple as that?

01:26:08.871 --> 01:26:12.237
I've seen farmers with their crops ruined
and their cattle dead.

01:26:12.308 --> 01:26:14.240
And most of them just go to work...

01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:17.142
but some of them blame their troubles
on God and get drunk...

01:26:17.211 --> 01:26:19.304
to forget, to run away...
to run away and hide!

01:26:19.379 --> 01:26:21.314
That's what you're doing.

01:26:21.381 --> 01:26:24.282
Whenever you've come up against something
unpleasant that you couldn't change...

01:26:24.352 --> 01:26:26.752
- Like the rent laws...
- Or the death of my son.

01:26:26.821 --> 01:26:29.948
- Our son.
- Get out of here.

01:26:33.294 --> 01:26:35.660
- Nicholas, let me help you.
- I don't need to be helped.

01:26:35.731 --> 01:26:38.698
Help me then.
Please don't shut me out like this.

01:26:38.766 --> 01:26:41.291
Let me be unhappy with you
and happy again.

01:26:41.368 --> 01:26:45.100
Let me be part of you.
Let me love you, and love me too!

01:27:06.828 --> 01:27:09.388
That's quite a story, Peggy, but...

01:27:09.463 --> 01:27:13.366
I'm afraid you'll have to tell Mrs. Van Ryn
there isn't much I can do for her husband.

01:27:13.434 --> 01:27:15.868
Tell her?
She doesn't even know I've come here.

01:27:15.937 --> 01:27:19.838
- Then what...
- Do you suppose I'd so much

01:27:19.907 --> 01:27:23.206
- It's her I'm afraid for, Dr. Jeff.
- Afraid of what?

01:27:23.277 --> 01:27:26.803
I can't say right out, but there's
a blackness in that house and in him.

01:27:26.881 --> 01:27:29.508
His comin' and goin',
the look in his eye when he watches her.

01:27:29.583 --> 01:27:31.677
You've got to come and take her away!

01:27:31.752 --> 01:27:34.586
- What makes you think she'd want to go?
- Whether she wants to or not!

01:27:34.655 --> 01:27:36.647
I'm only a doctor. I've got no right.

01:27:36.725 --> 01:27:39.124
You can't leave her there
to be hurt and hurt again...

01:27:39.193 --> 01:27:42.391
not knowing what she's done wrong
or how to do right...

01:27:42.462 --> 01:27:45.523
happy as a child because he so much
as sends a plant to her room.

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:49.365
- A plant?
- An ugly-looking growth to my taste

01:27:49.438 --> 01:27:52.997
- Has she been taking her meals in her room?
- Yes, of times.

01:27:53.074 --> 01:27:55.735
Why?

01:27:55.810 --> 01:27:57.745
Come on.

01:28:52.531 --> 01:28:55.626
Please don't stop on my account.

01:28:56.836 --> 01:28:58.827
Your father wouldn't have.

01:28:58.905 --> 01:29:02.635
I remember how he continued
to read so doggedly.

01:29:02.708 --> 01:29:07.146
Ephraim Wells took his religion without
flinching, the way a strong man should.

01:29:07.213 --> 01:29:09.647
Nicholas, what do you want?

01:29:11.051 --> 01:29:13.815
I appreciate
the warmth of your greeting...

01:29:13.887 --> 01:29:17.846
quick happiness in your face at my appearance,
your pleasure at my company.

01:29:17.924 --> 01:29:20.017
Why have you come here?

01:29:20.091 --> 01:29:24.028
Inasmuch as this is my house,
must I explain my presence in it?

01:29:25.666 --> 01:29:28.156
Of course not.

01:29:28.234 --> 01:29:30.998
Forgive me. I'm... I'm so tired.

01:29:31.071 --> 01:29:35.872
I'm sure you are.
This has been a trying time for you.

01:29:35.942 --> 01:29:39.708
And yet strangely enough,
your tribulations seem to have become you.

01:29:39.779 --> 01:29:42.940
I cannot remember you
more beautiful than you are now.

01:29:43.017 --> 01:29:46.213
Your beauty amazes me
as much now as always.

01:29:46.286 --> 01:29:49.778
Your strength, the earthiness
of your peasant stock...

01:29:49.855 --> 01:29:52.983
More, your grace...

01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:56.961
your unexpected look of quality.

01:29:57.030 --> 01:30:00.830
It would be a pity
if we were not to have another...

01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:02.925
if you were barren.

01:30:05.070 --> 01:30:07.903
- That's a matter of the Lord's will.
- Oh, yes. The Lord...

01:30:07.975 --> 01:30:12.967
I'd forgotten. The Lord
who giveth life and also takes it away.

01:30:13.046 --> 01:30:16.071
- Why did he take my son's life?
- I have no way of knowing that.

01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:19.209
It could not have been without purpose.
No one gives life...

01:30:19.286 --> 01:30:22.721
takes it without purpose.

01:30:22.789 --> 01:30:27.351
Why do you suppose you are here, Miranda?
By the Lord's will, or by mine?

01:30:27.426 --> 01:30:30.123
What you are is the reflection
of what I wanted you to be.

01:30:30.195 --> 01:30:32.687
You live the life that I gave you.

01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:38.133
Now you do look frightened.

01:30:38.205 --> 01:30:40.194
What are you thinking?

01:30:40.273 --> 01:30:43.730
- Of Johanna.
- Why?

01:30:43.809 --> 01:30:46.574
I don't know.

01:31:03.997 --> 01:31:06.727
- Do you hear it?
- What?

01:31:08.267 --> 01:31:11.669
Nothing. Wind through the trees.

01:31:12.806 --> 01:31:14.933
- There is no wind!
- There is!

01:31:16.108 --> 01:31:18.771
A creaking board somewhere.

01:31:18.844 --> 01:31:21.573
- It's not important. It's stopped now.

01:31:21.648 --> 01:31:24.310
- But I didn't hear anything.
- Neither did I!

01:31:25.884 --> 01:31:29.547
Yes, you do.
It's... It's from the Red Room!

01:31:29.621 --> 01:31:31.611
- The harpsichord... Azilde!
- Stop it!

01:31:31.691 --> 01:31:33.989
Then Katrine did hear her that night
when Johanna...

01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:39.361
And you must've heard her too. And you must've
been listening the night our little son...

01:31:39.431 --> 01:31:43.334
I never believed it really, but now I do.

01:32:38.690 --> 01:32:42.387
I just happened to be passing by,
and I thought I'd drop in.

01:32:42.461 --> 01:32:44.953
Passing by? I see.

01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:49.762
Summoned in the best heroic tradition
by the faithful little cripple.

01:32:49.837 --> 01:32:54.498
And have you an army of farmers equipped
with pitchforks lurking in the garden?

01:32:54.572 --> 01:32:58.669
No. That fight’s all over,
and you lost it.

01:32:58.745 --> 01:33:00.713
But Peggy seemed worried
about you, so I...

01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:03.839
Do I look as if I needed medical aid
in the dead of the night?

01:33:03.917 --> 01:33:07.682
You can hardly expect a diagnosis from me
based upon your appearance alone.

01:33:07.753 --> 01:33:12.054
It's good to know you have become
more careful in your diagnoses, Doctor.

01:33:12.124 --> 01:33:14.923
I can recall when you were less thorough.

01:33:14.994 --> 01:33:18.758
- I've improved a lot since then.
- There was much room for improvement.

01:33:18.831 --> 01:33:21.995
May I be frank?
You're not a very good doctor, Dr. Turner.

01:33:22.068 --> 01:33:24.864
There are too many things
you should know that you don't.

01:33:24.939 --> 01:33:27.235
I still insist I've improved.

01:33:27.307 --> 01:33:31.743
For one thing, I've learned
a great deal about plant life.

01:33:31.811 --> 01:33:34.677
I would think that human life
were more to the point.

01:33:34.748 --> 01:33:38.080
I've discovered that the two
are strangely related.

01:33:38.151 --> 01:33:40.745
You know, in a way,
you're responsible for it all.

01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:45.621
How nice. We must discuss
your discoveries sometime soon.

01:33:45.691 --> 01:33:49.150
- What about right now?
- (Miranda)Jeff.

01:33:49.229 --> 01:33:52.392
What are you doing here
at this time of night?

01:33:52.464 --> 01:33:56.526
- The patron and I are discussing flowers.
- Flowers?

01:33:56.603 --> 01:34:01.233
While we're on the subject, I suppose you've
thanked him for the lovely plant in your room?

01:34:01.307 --> 01:34:04.038
- I don't understand.
- It doesn't matter. He does.

01:34:04.109 --> 01:34:07.739
Is it as pretty as the plant in your late wife's
bedroom the night she died?

01:34:07.813 --> 01:34:10.908
Aren't you letting the discussion
become rather morbid, Dr. Turner?

01:34:10.982 --> 01:34:14.818
I was never able to forget that plant.
At first I thought it was beautiful.

01:34:14.887 --> 01:34:18.448
- But I've learned since then it was also very deadly.
- Nicholas, what does he mean?

01:34:18.524 --> 01:34:22.620
It's a glucoside similar in action
to digitalis but much more toxic.

01:34:22.694 --> 01:34:26.598
It was a good idea to have a doctor on hand
that night you asked me to stay for dinner.

01:34:26.666 --> 01:34:28.998
Weren't you lucky
I wasn't a better doctor at the time?

01:34:29.067 --> 01:34:32.003
It was all so legitimate.
Your wife with a bad cold...

01:34:32.071 --> 01:34:35.472
She couldn't have tasted anything
in the cake. It was all soaked with rum.!

01:34:35.541 --> 01:34:37.838
I don't believe it!

01:35:21.454 --> 01:35:23.444
Miranda...

01:35:23.522 --> 01:35:25.787
you'd better come with us.

01:35:29.795 --> 01:35:31.730
Come on.

01:36:24.049 --> 01:36:26.108
Tom Wilson.

01:36:26.184 --> 01:36:30.746
Jeb Ribling! Gebhard, Brown, Berger...

01:36:30.822 --> 01:36:33.621
Come forward, all of you!

01:36:33.693 --> 01:36:35.854
I have something to say to you.

01:36:37.696 --> 01:36:42.030
Apparently I have not yet been able
to make my position clear.

01:36:42.101 --> 01:36:44.966
I will try once more...

01:36:45.037 --> 01:36:48.005
but believe me,
my patience has come to an end!

01:36:49.609 --> 01:36:52.578
Lives, liberties, happinesses...

01:36:52.646 --> 01:36:57.105
Pursue them where you will. Sing and dance
and dip them in bronze, if you like!

01:36:57.184 --> 01:36:59.845
But you will not destroy Dragonwyck.

01:36:59.919 --> 01:37:03.877
You will not take away from me
what has been mine for more than 200 years!

01:37:03.956 --> 01:37:07.687
No babbling idiot of a governor will
make laws that have to do with my manor...

01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:10.160
with the manor that my son...

01:37:13.697 --> 01:37:16.065
that my son will inherit.

01:37:20.672 --> 01:37:23.608
Oh, it's Dr. Turner.

01:37:23.676 --> 01:37:27.635
What are you doing here?
You are not wanted. You're trespassing.

01:37:27.712 --> 01:37:31.171
I don't want you here.
I don't need you anymore.

01:37:31.250 --> 01:37:34.482
There was a time when you knew too little
and I could use you, but now...

01:38:11.891 --> 01:38:14.381
If you don't mind, Mr. Van Ryn...

01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:16.951
I'll have to ask you
to come along with us.

01:38:18.764 --> 01:38:21.230
- Mayor Curtis, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

01:38:21.299 --> 01:38:24.234
I do mind, very much.

01:38:24.302 --> 01:38:27.363
I have no intention
of going anywhere with anyone.

01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:32.172
This is not a request, Van Ryn. You're being
ordered to come along. You're under arrest.

01:38:32.245 --> 01:38:35.078
I will not be ordered
to do anything by anyone.

01:38:35.147 --> 01:38:37.581
This is my property,
and you will all leave it at once.

01:38:37.649 --> 01:38:42.109
Nicholas! Please.
This is your only chance.

01:38:43.256 --> 01:38:45.554
My only chance?

01:38:45.626 --> 01:38:48.856
How little you know me, Miranda.

01:38:48.928 --> 01:38:51.021
Even Johanna would never have said that.

01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:57.028
Dr. Turner,
you might use your influence...

01:38:57.103 --> 01:39:01.039
to benefit these men for once
and tell them to get out of here.

01:39:01.106 --> 01:39:04.372
How little you know me, Mr. Van Ryn,
or them.

01:39:04.442 --> 01:39:07.002
You don't believe I'd shoot?

01:39:07.079 --> 01:39:09.945
Yes, I believe you.

01:39:10.017 --> 01:39:11.643
Have it your way then!

01:39:53.226 --> 01:39:55.284
That's right.

01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:58.354
Take off your hats
in the presence of the patron.

01:40:29.695 --> 01:40:31.629
Hello, Jeff.

01:40:31.697 --> 01:40:34.427
I thought, if you didn't mind,
I'd ride alongside to the boat landing.

01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:37.434
- You're welcome to ride inside.
- Thanks. I'd like nothing more...

01:40:37.503 --> 01:40:39.994
but then I'd have to
ride back here in it alone.

01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:43.405
- You understand, don't you?
- Of course I do.

01:40:45.176 --> 01:40:48.942
Good-bye, Mrs. MacNab,
and thank you for everything.

01:40:49.015 --> 01:40:51.915
It'll be lonely here without you,
Mrs. Van Ryn.

01:40:53.286 --> 01:40:55.377
Mrs. Van Ryn...

01:40:55.454 --> 01:40:58.583
Suddenly it sounded strange
to hear you called that.

01:41:10.736 --> 01:41:12.829
Is that all you're taking with you?

01:41:12.905 --> 01:41:18.843
It's all I brought with me... from home,
except a black dress.

01:41:18.911 --> 01:41:23.574
The way you just said "home"...
as if you never had any other.

01:41:23.648 --> 01:41:25.981
Have I ever?

01:41:26.051 --> 01:41:28.145
You answer that.

01:41:28.219 --> 01:41:32.919
You know, Ma once said she felt she
shouldn't have let me come to Dragonwyck...

01:41:32.992 --> 01:41:35.426
that she was afraid.

01:41:35.494 --> 01:41:38.052
You couldn't marry a dream, she said.

01:41:40.632 --> 01:41:45.037
- Do you dream much, Jeff?
- Sometimes.

01:41:45.104 --> 01:41:48.664
Some dreams are very real, I guess.

01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:52.506
So real that they
get confused with reality.

01:41:52.577 --> 01:41:55.511
And then when you wake up
and look around...

01:41:55.581 --> 01:42:00.678
you find yourself saying, "What am I
doing here? How did I get here?

01:42:00.753 --> 01:42:04.918
What has this to do with what I am
and what I want?"

01:42:06.393 --> 01:42:09.850
Then I guess you make up your mind
you've had a nightmare...

01:42:09.928 --> 01:42:13.559
And you go crawling to your ma and pa.

01:42:15.201 --> 01:42:17.761
So it's back to Greenwich now, Miranda...

01:42:17.836 --> 01:42:19.931
with never another thought
of anything here.

01:42:20.005 --> 01:42:23.373
Well, Greenwich
isn't so far away after all.

01:42:23.442 --> 01:42:27.640
Perhaps you'll be passing
through sometime, Jeff.

01:42:31.182 --> 01:42:33.878
Would next week be too soon?
