00:01.001 --> 00:02.636
Jim, could you
come in here, please?

00:02.670 --> 00:05.606
[typing on keyboard]

00:09.143 --> 00:10.644
[robotic voice]
Hi, Jim.

00:10.678 --> 00:11.645
Hello.

00:11.679 --> 00:14.415
I am Harvey,
a computer.

00:14.448 --> 00:17.251
Jim sucks.

00:17.285 --> 00:19.153
[Michael laughing]
Sorry.
Zing.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.454
Oh, wow.

00:20.488 --> 00:21.822
That's so rude.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.524
I'm sorry,
I can't control him.

00:23.557 --> 00:24.792
Yeah, you can.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.560
You know what?
Get Pam.
For this?

00:26.594 --> 00:28.162
[loudly]
Pam.

00:29.530 --> 00:34.034
(Harvey)
Pam, you look
very hot today.

00:36.104 --> 00:37.004
Pam, meet Harvey.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.539
This is Michael's
new friend.
Great.

00:38.572 --> 00:41.675
Me so horny.
Me love you long tim.

00:41.709 --> 00:42.676
(Jim)
Whoa.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.812
(Michael)
Oh, that is gross!

00:44.845 --> 00:46.080
Who is "Long Tim"?

00:46.114 --> 00:47.715
Damn it.

00:47.748 --> 00:50.284
[typing]

00:50.318 --> 00:51.285
(Harvey)
Long time.

00:51.319 --> 00:52.520
Me love yoy
a long time.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.855
Oh, well, yoy should
bring Long Tim in one day.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.224
(Pam)
I'd love to meet
Long Tim.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.758
Yeah, right?
Yeah.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.293
You ruined
a funny joke.

00:59.327 --> 01:01.595
You get out
of my off-five.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.631
Okay.
Okay.

01:03.664 --> 01:04.665
Bye, Harvey.

01:08.236 --> 01:10.838
Boobs.

01:10.871 --> 01:13.274
[laughing]

01:13.307 --> 01:17.411
[cheerful music]

01:17.445 --> 01:25.586
*

01:38.866 --> 01:40.468
Angela.
What?

01:40.501 --> 01:43.404
That was a voice mail
that corporate left last night.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.905
They did not get
our tax forms.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.841
Did you send them?

01:47.875 --> 01:49.510
They arrived this morning.

01:49.543 --> 01:50.844
Are you sure?

01:50.878 --> 01:52.846
It is a big deal.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.349
Is it a big deal?
Is it, Kevin?

01:56.950 --> 01:59.153
Do you really not know?

01:59.187 --> 02:00.788
Because it is a big deal.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.892
(Andy)
Five of us transferred
from Stamford.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.194
There's two of us left.

02:06.227 --> 02:08.662
Me and Karen.

02:08.696 --> 02:11.565
It's like we're touring
Willy Wonka's chocolate factory,

02:11.599 --> 02:14.168
and dropping off
one by one.

02:14.202 --> 02:15.936
Well, guess what.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.839
I'm not falling
in a chocolate river.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.341
[door opens]

02:22.443 --> 02:24.778
[sighs]

02:24.812 --> 02:26.780
[quietly]
Everything okay?

02:26.814 --> 02:28.849
Just fine.

02:28.882 --> 02:29.817
You are in the clear.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.419
Thank you.

02:37.225 --> 02:39.293
I don't--
I don't want those.

02:41.529 --> 02:42.696
Dwight,

02:42.730 --> 02:43.964
care to join us,
finally?

02:43.997 --> 02:46.200
Thank you.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.536
Hey, Dwight,
pass the tardy sauce.

02:48.569 --> 02:49.703
(Andy)
Get it, Michael?

02:49.737 --> 02:50.704
Yes.

02:50.738 --> 02:53.907
Okay, here is
the dream team.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.843
My sales dream team.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.945
Today we are going to
team up for sales calls.

02:57.978 --> 03:00.348
Andy, since this was
your idea,

03:00.381 --> 03:01.349
you get to pick first.

03:01.382 --> 03:03.651
Hmm, well,

03:03.684 --> 03:05.986
let me think about this
for a minute.

03:06.019 --> 03:09.257
Oh, I don't know...
Michael Scott.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.891
Oh.
PhD.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.926
Doctor of sales.

03:12.960 --> 03:13.694
(Michael)
Well, I appreciate that.

03:13.727 --> 03:14.595
That's very gracious
of you.

03:14.628 --> 03:17.498
Well it is very gracious
of you to accept.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.767
Well,
thank you, sir.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.670
(Michael)
Okay, now going
by seniority,

03:22.703 --> 03:24.872
Phyllis,
our resident senior.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.408
We're the same age.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.443
And I'll pick Karen.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.912
Oh, uh, thanks.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.747
(Michael)
Good.

03:33.781 --> 03:35.916
Next up,
the Super Fly himself,

03:35.949 --> 03:36.917
Stanley.

03:36.950 --> 03:37.785
Pass.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.654
You can't pass.
You gotta pick somebody.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.594
I'll take the kid.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.028
(Ryan)
I'm very flattered.

03:48.061 --> 03:51.399
I was his second choice,
after "pass."

03:51.432 --> 03:53.901
So that just leaves
Dwight and Jim.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.903
Okay, wait, does anyone
want to trade?

03:55.936 --> 03:58.572
Yeah, I'll trade.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.741
Dwight and I used to
go on sales calls all the time.

04:00.774 --> 04:04.478
In fact, I have a picture
to remember that time.

04:04.512 --> 04:05.946
Oh, young Jim.

04:05.979 --> 04:09.850
There's just so much
I need to warn you about.

04:09.883 --> 04:14.788
And yet, tragically,
I cannot.

04:14.822 --> 04:17.291
Sebring, by Chrysler.

04:17.325 --> 04:19.827
A heck of a motor carriage.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.930
Dwight, here ya go!

04:22.963 --> 04:24.398
Yeah!

04:24.432 --> 04:25.933
You want shirts
on hangers?
Please.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.335
He does your laundry?

04:27.368 --> 04:29.770
Long story.

04:29.803 --> 04:30.971
All right, everybody,
circle up.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.674
Here we go.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.309
You know that this is?

04:35.343 --> 04:36.877
This is the Amazing Race.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.912
And you guys are
the retired marines.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.849
And you guys are
the mother/daughter.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.684
And you guys are
the gay couple.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.653
And we are
the firefighter heroes.

04:45.686 --> 04:46.854
Are we ready to go?

04:46.887 --> 04:50.658
Wait, Amazing Race, like,
the biggest sale wins?

04:50.691 --> 04:52.092
No, we're just gonna
rush out,

04:52.125 --> 04:53.694
do the sales thing,
and come back.

04:53.727 --> 04:54.862
Is there a prize?

04:54.895 --> 04:55.863
Just bragging rights.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.465
Then how is this
Amazing Race?

04:57.498 --> 04:58.899
It's just--brrrrr.

04:58.932 --> 05:01.835
It's Amazing Race,
Phyllis, okay?

05:01.869 --> 05:04.037
We're in teams of two,
and we are on a mission.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.774
All right, so,
on your mark,

05:06.807 --> 05:07.808
get set, go.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.710
Let's do it.
Come on!

05:14.114 --> 05:16.049
Michael--
Whoa, whoa.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.885
Oh, ho ho ho!

05:17.918 --> 05:19.920
Vamanos.
Bueno.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.823
Do you have a pole?

05:22.856 --> 05:24.492
[sighs]
Let's go get a broom.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.960
Seriously, you're gonna sit
in the back?

05:26.994 --> 05:28.362
Uh, yeah.

05:28.396 --> 05:29.863
It's the safest part
of a car.

05:29.897 --> 05:30.764
In the event of a crash,

05:30.798 --> 05:33.834
the driver always
protects his side first.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.102
[tires screech]

05:37.905 --> 05:40.374
Here we go.
Whoo!

05:40.408 --> 05:41.775
(Andy)
In order to take down Dwight,

05:41.809 --> 05:43.511
I have to chip away
at his ally.

05:43.544 --> 05:44.645
In this case, Michael.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.514
And here's the good news.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.416
Every success
I've ever had,

05:48.449 --> 05:51.051
in my job, or with
the lady folk,

05:51.084 --> 05:52.986
has come from my ability

05:53.020 --> 05:54.988
to slowly
and painfully

05:55.022 --> 05:58.158
wear someone down.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.027
What's the deal with Dwight
doing your laundry?

06:00.060 --> 06:03.864
[scoffs]
That is a long story.

06:03.897 --> 06:07.401
Um, a couple months ago,

06:07.435 --> 06:09.970
Dwight tried to
go behind my back with Jan

06:10.003 --> 06:12.139
and get my job.

06:12.172 --> 06:15.075
And I am now having him
do my laundry as punishment.

06:15.108 --> 06:18.111
Wow, that is
a long story,

06:18.145 --> 06:20.548
but quite well told,
Michael.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.583
I find it
very interesting.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.418
Especially the part
about Dwight

06:24.452 --> 06:25.819
going behind your back,

06:25.853 --> 06:30.491
and basically being,
like, a terrible person.

06:30.524 --> 06:33.126
You know, if you want
your laundry done right,

06:33.160 --> 06:34.895
I used to work
at Abercrombie.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.998
So...pretty good folder.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.201
Why are we turning
in here?

06:41.234 --> 06:42.703
This is a beauty salon.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.872
Mm-hmm.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.807
Hey, do you mind
if I take the lead

06:46.840 --> 06:47.608
on this one?

06:47.641 --> 06:49.209
And then, you can
critique me after.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.844
You want the lead?

06:50.878 --> 06:52.212
Yeah,
if you don't mind.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.647
Mind?

06:53.681 --> 06:55.215
Nothing would
delight me more.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.785
[chuckles]

07:02.956 --> 07:04.958
Hey, Pam, would you like
to go with me

07:04.992 --> 07:05.959
to grab a coffee?

07:05.993 --> 07:07.995
Really?

07:08.028 --> 07:08.929
Yeah.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.664
I thought you could use
some fresh air.

07:10.698 --> 07:12.132
It might be fun.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.967
Okay, sure.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.503
Okay.

07:22.743 --> 07:23.844
Leave the keys.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.513
You still do that thing?

07:25.546 --> 07:27.214
Leave the keys.

07:31.652 --> 07:34.755
[car radio blaring
hard rock music]

07:34.788 --> 07:42.796
*

07:46.734 --> 07:48.101
I think that you
have assembled

07:48.135 --> 07:50.871
an amazing team
in Scranton.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.506
It's really a pleasure
to be a part of it.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.942
It's like everyone has
their own special skill.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.578
You know, just like
the Super Friends.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.012
Except for Dwight,

07:59.046 --> 08:01.815
who's kind of more of
a super dud.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.717
I mean, he'd be
a Super Friend,

08:03.751 --> 08:06.053
if there was a Super Friend
whose super power was

08:06.086 --> 08:07.721
always being late.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.957
You know?

08:09.990 --> 08:12.993
Hawkman.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.864
My plan is taking longer
than I thought.

08:16.897 --> 08:19.600
But I don't give up easily.

08:19.633 --> 08:22.903
I have walked
two marathons, so--

08:22.936 --> 08:23.971
[toilet flushes]

08:24.004 --> 08:26.206
Let's go.

08:28.876 --> 08:31.879
The men's room
was disgusting.

08:34.314 --> 08:35.315
After you, sir.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.550
No, thank you.

08:36.584 --> 08:37.450
I never let anyone
walk behind me.

08:37.484 --> 08:39.286
Seven out of ten attacks
are from the rear.

08:39.319 --> 08:40.821
Okay, well,
that still leaves

08:40.854 --> 08:42.890
a 30% chance that I'll
attack you from the front.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.825
Yeah, but it'll be
easier to stop.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.126
I can always block
the blow.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.161
Or I can counter--

08:55.302 --> 08:57.638
Hey, did you catch that

08:57.671 --> 08:58.939
up in Lake Wallenpaupack?

08:58.972 --> 09:00.173
Yep.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.875
You know, I used to
go up there all the time

09:01.909 --> 09:02.743
with my stepdad,

09:02.776 --> 09:04.878
and I never caught
anything that big.

09:04.912 --> 09:08.816
I caught an 80-pound shark
off Montauk.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.784
It's in the Hamptons.
Uh-huh.

09:10.818 --> 09:13.053
My dad's got
a 42-foot Bayliner.

09:13.086 --> 09:16.624
Sniped it with a rifle
from the crow's nest.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.292
Also shot a deer once.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.427
You know what?
Let's get right down to it.

09:20.460 --> 09:25.032
Dunder-Mifflin may be
just two rooms and a warehouse,

09:25.065 --> 09:26.600
but what we lack
in flash,

09:26.634 --> 09:30.337
we will make up for
with hard work and decency--

09:30.370 --> 09:33.173
Okay, this is
the classic undersell.

09:33.206 --> 09:35.909
Because you should know

09:35.943 --> 09:37.611
we don't work
out of a log cabin.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.613
(Andy)
We trade on the New York
Stock Exchange.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.849
Ever heard of it?
It's in New York.

09:41.882 --> 09:44.818
I have to say
I'm a little wary

09:44.852 --> 09:46.654
of getting involved
with a big company.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.255
We've had some problems
in the past.

09:48.288 --> 09:52.192
I think what Andy
is trying to express is that

09:52.225 --> 09:54.695
while we have the resources
of a large company,

09:54.728 --> 09:56.664
we will give you
the care and attention

09:56.697 --> 09:57.965
of a small company.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.834
Man, that is
like poetry.

10:00.868 --> 10:01.869
No.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.637
I swear, this guy
could sell paper to a tree.

10:03.671 --> 10:04.738
No, stop it.
Stop.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.373
Ow.

10:06.406 --> 10:12.412
Oh, man, talk about
your classic lame-dash-o.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.649
Do we even want that guy
buying our paper?

10:15.683 --> 10:17.918
Yes.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.020
Angela, you seem
so happy.

10:21.855 --> 10:24.792
I bet you wish you were
like this all the time.

10:24.825 --> 10:29.396
This friend of mine--
let's call her Noelle.

10:29.429 --> 10:32.232
She missed this deadline

10:32.265 --> 10:34.768
turning something in
to corporate in New York.

10:34.802 --> 10:37.871
But then this gallant
gentleman--

10:37.905 --> 10:38.906
we'll call him Curt.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.741
He drove all the way
to New York

10:40.774 --> 10:42.810
and handed it in
for her.

10:42.843 --> 10:45.078
Because--I don't know.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.347
I guess he just
really likes her a lot.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.850
Well, that's great.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.651
Yes, it is.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.457
Hello?

10:57.490 --> 11:00.794
I'm--
I'm so sorry, man.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.732
I really
screwed that up.

11:04.765 --> 11:05.866
Oh--
Really--no.

11:05.899 --> 11:06.867
Don't worry about it.

11:06.900 --> 11:07.968
I really Schruted it.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.737
What?

11:09.770 --> 11:10.971
Schruted it.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.741
It just this thing people say
around your office all the time.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.175
Like when you
screw something up

11:15.208 --> 11:17.410
in a really
irreversible way,

11:17.444 --> 11:19.780
you Schruted it.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.982
I don't know where
it comes from, though.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.951
You think it comes
from Dwight Schrute?

11:23.984 --> 11:25.385
I don't know.

11:25.418 --> 11:28.188
Who knows how words
are formed?

11:30.791 --> 11:31.925
That's a big order.
Thanks, Ken.

11:31.959 --> 11:32.926
Yeah, thank you.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.061
Hey, how's Annie?

11:34.094 --> 11:35.729
Oh, she's great.

11:35.763 --> 11:40.067
This is us last year
in Bermuda.

11:41.835 --> 11:42.803
(Ken)
Lovely place.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.104
You ever been
to Bermuda?

11:44.137 --> 11:45.505
Stanley Hudson.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.340
Ah, Julius.
How's it going?

11:47.374 --> 11:49.409
Great, great,
great, great, great.

11:49.442 --> 11:50.844
Stanley, so good
to see you.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.179
You too.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.247
I'd like you fellas
to meet Ryan Howard.

11:54.281 --> 11:55.783
Hi.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.785
I'm gonna let Ryan
do a little pitch for you

11:57.818 --> 11:58.952
while I do
my crossword puzzle.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.120
Ryan?

12:03.891 --> 12:06.760
Um...

12:08.829 --> 12:09.797
Hi.

12:09.830 --> 12:10.998
Hi.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.465
Hi.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.834
Hello, Ryan.
Hi.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.770
What do you have
for us?

12:16.804 --> 12:18.105
Oh--

12:18.138 --> 12:19.773
We can offer
our biggest discounts

12:19.807 --> 12:22.209
on 30% recycled,
and ultra-premium laser.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.376
Okay.
Okay.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.112
Can I use your phone?

12:25.145 --> 12:26.814
Yeah, sure, go ahead.
Thanks.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.015
Let me talk to you about
a few of the other things

12:28.048 --> 12:29.216
we can offer.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.984
Namely, we know
the tax season's coming up.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.820
So by April 1st,
we can have you fully stocked.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.054
(Dwight)
One...

12:34.087 --> 12:35.055
(Tim)
Discount prices
on ink cartridges.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.223
Three....

12:36.256 --> 12:37.791
And also any forms
that you're gonna need,

12:37.825 --> 12:40.928
Seven.
we can
custom make them.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.796
[music playing
through receiver]

12:42.830 --> 12:45.065
[chuckling]

12:45.098 --> 12:48.235
And you just said,
"Hi. Hi. Hi."

12:48.268 --> 12:50.137
[chuckles]

12:50.170 --> 12:52.005
You sounded like...

12:52.039 --> 12:53.573
[chuckling]

12:53.606 --> 12:54.842
My niece.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.845
And she's
six months old.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.479
[music playing
through receiver]

12:59.512 --> 13:01.014
I appreciate what
you guys are saying,

13:01.048 --> 13:02.215
but it makes more
fiscal sense

13:02.249 --> 13:03.550
to go with one
of the big guys.

13:03.583 --> 13:04.818
Sure.
That's true.

13:04.852 --> 13:05.886
We can't compete
with their prices.

13:05.919 --> 13:06.753
But let me
ask you something.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.588
How important to you
is customer service?

13:08.621 --> 13:10.290
Very.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.324
[male voice over telephone]
Please keep holding.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.060
Your call is
very important to us.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.195
That's one
of the "big guys."

13:15.228 --> 13:16.864
Been on hold
this whole time.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.399
And this is
Dunder-Mifflin.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.068
[phone ringing]

13:21.101 --> 13:22.269
[woman on phone]
Dunder-Mifflin
customer service.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.037
This is Kelly.
Hey, Kelly, it's Jim.

13:24.071 --> 13:26.439
Oh, my God, Jim,
how are you?

13:26.473 --> 13:28.041
Here's my card.

13:28.075 --> 13:29.877
It's got my cell number,
my pager number,

13:29.910 --> 13:31.845
my home number,
and my other pager number.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.914
I never take vacations,
I never get sick,

13:33.947 --> 13:35.282
and I don't celebrate
any major holidays.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.284
All right,
I get it.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.585
We got a deal.

13:38.618 --> 13:39.920
All right.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.221
Thanks,
that was fun.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.122
Yeah.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.623
I really enjoy
spending time with you.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.158
You're a very
nice person.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.259
Thank you.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.595
And I'm so glad
you're with Jim.

13:48.628 --> 13:52.232
He was hung up on Pam
for such a long time.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.902
I didn't think
he'd ever get over her.

13:57.604 --> 14:00.908
That's nice.

14:00.941 --> 14:05.112
You can pay me back later
for the makeover.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.614
[chuckling]

14:10.183 --> 14:11.318
Whew!

14:11.351 --> 14:12.652
(Andy)
Hey, boss.

14:12.685 --> 14:13.553
[knocks on door]

14:13.586 --> 14:15.555
Got a minute?
(Michael)
Yes, Andy.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.891
(Andy)
I forget, why did Dwight say
he was late this morning?

14:17.925 --> 14:18.892
(Michael)
He didn't say.

14:18.926 --> 14:20.160
(Andy)
That's weird.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.895
Because I was just walking
past his desk,

14:21.929 --> 14:24.664
and I saw this, which is
a toll booth receipt

14:24.697 --> 14:26.566
from New York City,

14:26.599 --> 14:30.637
stamped really early
this morning.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.605
Why would Dwight go
to New York

14:32.639 --> 14:35.175
without telling
anyone?

14:35.208 --> 14:36.576
You think he went
to see Jan?

14:36.609 --> 14:38.645
That's not like him.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.948
Is it?

14:40.981 --> 14:42.983
Someone told me a story
about this,

14:43.016 --> 14:47.554
with, like, laundry
and betrayal.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.589
Did you betray Dwight,

14:49.622 --> 14:51.925
and try to steal his job
or something?

14:51.959 --> 14:56.263
No, you are
remembering it wrong.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.631
Dwight betrayed me
once before.

14:58.665 --> 15:01.601
So this is his
strike two.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.436
You know what they say.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.973
Fool me once,
strike one.

15:06.006 --> 15:09.642
But fool me twice...

15:09.676 --> 15:11.678
strike three.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.715
I like Karen.
She's pretty.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.185
Appears intelligent.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.420
Well, I like pretty women

15:20.453 --> 15:24.124
who have the appearance
of intelligence.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.726
My girlfriend is also
beautiful and smart.

15:26.759 --> 15:30.497
She could be a model,
or a college professor

15:30.530 --> 15:33.700
which is intimidating
to a lot of guys.

15:33.733 --> 15:36.036
We should go on
a double date.

15:36.069 --> 15:39.172
[scoffs]
No, thank you.

15:39.206 --> 15:41.708
[woman on phone]
Dwight's name is on
the security sign-in sheet,

15:41.741 --> 15:45.012
but I don't know
who he met with.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.080
And where it asks you
to state your business,

15:47.114 --> 15:49.082
he wrote
"Beeswax Not Yours, Inc."

15:49.116 --> 15:50.183
I knew it.

15:50.217 --> 15:52.152
[door opens]

15:54.187 --> 15:56.990
Oooooh, doggy.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.125
Hey,

15:58.158 --> 15:59.626
you wanna grab
a coffee?

15:59.659 --> 16:01.628
Sure.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.396
Look at you.

16:03.430 --> 16:06.166
Yeah.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.004
Hey, we nailed the sale.

16:11.038 --> 16:13.140
Where were you
this morning?

16:13.173 --> 16:15.308
I overslept.
Damn rooster didn't crow.

16:15.342 --> 16:17.610
Why do you lie,
liar?

16:17.644 --> 16:18.645
I am not a liar.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.113
You are lying right now.

16:20.147 --> 16:21.414
Sure seems like
he's lying.

16:21.448 --> 16:22.782
Stay out of this, you.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.218
(Michael)
I know that you went
to corporate this morning.

16:25.252 --> 16:28.388
And I know that you lied
about it.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.190
And given our history...

16:30.223 --> 16:33.126
I need you to tell me
right now

16:33.160 --> 16:35.562
exactly what you were doing
this morning.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.765
Michael, I cannot tell you
what I was doing there.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.200
But you have to trust me.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.169
I would never do anything
to hurt you

16:42.202 --> 16:43.436
or this company.

16:43.470 --> 16:44.571
Okay, you know what?

16:44.604 --> 16:46.139
I want you to think
about your future

16:46.173 --> 16:47.074
at this company.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.376
I want you to think about it
long and hard.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.377
That's what she said.

16:50.410 --> 16:51.644
[softly]
Don't.

16:51.678 --> 16:52.679
Don't you dare.

16:54.747 --> 16:57.217
I want to know what
you were doing this morning

16:57.250 --> 16:59.152
by the end of the day.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.559
[whispering]
It's gonna be okay.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.828
How's it gonna be
okay, Dwight?

17:08.861 --> 17:10.763
Everyone will know
our business.

17:10.797 --> 17:13.200
That's not the worst thing
in the world.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.435
I'll just stand up
in front of the office,

17:15.468 --> 17:18.271
and reveal
our true love.

17:18.305 --> 17:20.240
It won't be that bad.

17:20.273 --> 17:21.741
Look at Kelly and Ryan.

17:21.774 --> 17:23.276
I hate those two people

17:23.310 --> 17:25.112
more than anything
in the entire world.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.446
[sighs]

17:26.479 --> 17:30.117
Well, I don't have
a lot of choices.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.185
So let me ask you
a question.

17:32.219 --> 17:33.186
Okay.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.288
Did you ever have a thing
for Pam?

17:35.322 --> 17:37.290
Pam?

17:37.324 --> 17:39.592
Did I ever have a thing
for her?

17:39.626 --> 17:41.328
No.

17:41.361 --> 17:44.197
Why, did she
say something?

17:44.231 --> 17:47.200
I moved here
from Connecticut.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.735
Yeah--

17:48.768 --> 17:53.140
Okay, here's the--

17:53.173 --> 17:56.743
I had...a crush on her

17:56.776 --> 17:59.112
before I left.

17:59.146 --> 18:00.247
And I told her about it,

18:00.280 --> 18:02.482
and she didn't feel
the same way.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.117
So it didn't amount
to anything,

18:04.151 --> 18:06.186
and I left.

18:08.788 --> 18:11.491
I'm really glad
you're here.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.593
Okay?

18:13.626 --> 18:16.163
Okay.

18:19.566 --> 18:20.633
[loudly]
Ahem.

18:20.667 --> 18:24.804
May I have
your attention, please?

18:24.837 --> 18:28.675
This will only take a moment
of your time.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.443
Although I love this company

18:30.477 --> 18:32.245
more than almost
anything in the world,

18:32.279 --> 18:34.781
I have decided
to step down from my post

18:34.814 --> 18:36.616
and spend more time
with my family.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.918
I do not fear
the unknown.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.887
I will meet my new challenges
head on,

18:40.920 --> 18:42.088
and I will succeed.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.225
And I will laugh in the faces
of those who doubt me.

18:45.258 --> 18:48.228
It's been a pleasure
working with some of you,

18:48.261 --> 18:50.463
and I will not forget
those of you soon.

18:50.497 --> 18:53.466
But remember,
while today it is me,

18:53.500 --> 18:57.136
we all shall fall.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.809
In other words,
I'm quitting.

19:02.842 --> 19:04.411
So--

19:04.444 --> 19:06.713
* Oompa loompa

19:06.746 --> 19:08.881
* Doompadee dossum

19:08.915 --> 19:10.617
* Dwight is now gone

19:10.650 --> 19:13.320
* Which is totally awesome

19:13.353 --> 19:14.887
* Why was he gone?

19:14.921 --> 19:17.290
* He was such a nice guy

19:17.324 --> 19:18.558
* No, he was not

19:18.591 --> 19:20.593
* He was a total douche

19:20.627 --> 19:23.530
* Doompadee doom

19:23.563 --> 19:28.701
I would like to give
the rest of my belongings...

19:28.735 --> 19:29.902
to Michael Scott.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.972
Just take it.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.274
Except this.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.908
[clears throat]
Good luck.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.345
And this one.
Oops.

19:40.313 --> 19:42.915
Dwight will be missed.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.752
Not by me...so much.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.555
But he will be missed.

19:48.588 --> 19:52.225
Dwight...from sales...

19:52.259 --> 19:54.727
was one of the most honorable
and efficient employees

19:54.761 --> 19:57.264
this company has
ever had.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.666
(Dwight)
One of my life goals
was to die right here,

19:59.699 --> 20:01.834
in my desk chair.

20:01.868 --> 20:06.273
And today,
that dream was shattered.

Hey, man.

20:24.624 --> 20:28.528
What happened
on your sales call?

20:28.561 --> 20:31.631
Um, am I happy about
the way things turned out?

20:31.664 --> 20:35.868
Well, happy's
such an ugly word.

20:35.902 --> 20:39.372
But I saw what needed
to be done,

20:39.406 --> 20:40.540
and I did it.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.941
And now I'm thrilled.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.910
[chuckling]
So it's pretty--

20:43.943 --> 20:46.379
Hello?

20:46.413 --> 20:48.415
Pretty good.
