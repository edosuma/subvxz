Cousin Larry just
did a great thing.

What did he do?
Tear up your green card?

just saved my life.

Balki, it was nothing.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.535
I'll be the judge of that.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.336
We were walking
across the street

there was a runaway taxi

02:18.639 --> 02:20.541
about to runaway over me.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.909
And this man pushed
me out of the way.

It was a reflex.

In Mypos he would be
considered a very great man.

This is America.

he's no longer

Mypos they have rules.

16:24.785 --> 16:26.620
...but it's scaring
away customers.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.487
Why don't you go
to the basement

16:27.521 --> 16:30.757
and sort pants by color?

16:30.791 --> 16:33.493
Thank you.

16:33.527 --> 16:36.396
Not even fun to abuse anymore.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.198
‐ I don't know what to do.
‐ I'll tell you what to do.

16:38.231 --> 16:39.800
Go jump in front
of a taxi cab

16:39.833 --> 16:42.468
and hope the turnip
pulls you out of the way.

16:42.503 --> 16:44.470
And what if he doesn't?

16:44.505 --> 16:46.339
Either way your
problems are solved.

16:48.642 --> 16:50.310
Thanks, but I
prefer a solution

16:50.343 --> 16:51.545
that I can live through.

16:51.578 --> 16:54.247
Well, sure.
Think of yourself. Huh.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.281
Wait a minute,
I got an idea.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.383
I have a friend
who is an actor.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.586
Why don't you just hire him
to break into the apartment

16:59.620 --> 17:02.488
make a little noise,
wake up the turnip

17:02.523 --> 17:04.057
and then run like hell?

17:04.089 --> 17:06.291
He thinks he
saved your life

17:06.326 --> 17:07.560
and you're even.

17:08.628 --> 17:11.565
[laughing]

17:12.699 --> 17:14.601
Oh, y‐you mean it.
Uh, well..

17:14.635 --> 17:16.236
[clears throat]

17:16.269 --> 17:19.204
Well, uh, that's
a real, uh...idea.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.742
Uh, but, uh, uh,
I don't think so.

17:21.775 --> 17:23.309
Huh! It's up to you.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.078
You're the primopodomus.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.616
What's the cost
on something like this?

17:29.650 --> 17:32.218
‐ Fifty bucks.
‐ Fifty?

17:32.252 --> 17:34.187
I wouldn't be asking
him to do King Lear.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.523
Mr. Twinkacetti,
I can't find the basement.

17:36.557 --> 17:39.259
[clanging]

17:42.162 --> 17:44.130
I keep on looking.

17:45.699 --> 17:48.535
Have him come
before midnight.

17:48.569 --> 17:51.204
‐ I don't wanna be up late.
‐ Alright.

17:51.237 --> 17:52.205
Balki.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.241
Balki.

18:00.146 --> 18:03.183
Yeah, is Jimmy there?

18:03.216 --> 18:04.651
He's in New York?
What's he doing there?

18:06.219 --> 18:08.221
King Lear?

18:09.422 --> 18:11.191
Uh, no, no. No message.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.395
His loss...my gain.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.797
[instrumental music]

18:20.567 --> 18:23.504
[dog barking]

18:25.739 --> 18:28.675
[clock ticking]

18:32.212 --> 18:34.748
[intense music]

19:02.743 --> 19:04.711
Where have you been?

19:06.412 --> 19:08.448
You were supposed
to be here by midnight.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.416
I work my own hours.

19:11.752 --> 19:14.220
You're not supposed
to take things.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.422
That's what I do.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.258
Okay. Okay, nice touch.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.360
And look at this outfit.

19:20.393 --> 19:23.730
Who ever heard of a burglar
wearing a baseball cap?

19:23.764 --> 19:26.299
Alright, look, let
me go over it again.

19:26.332 --> 19:27.634
You come through the window

19:27.668 --> 19:28.935
you wake him up, threaten me.

19:28.969 --> 19:30.737
When he asks what's going on

19:30.771 --> 19:33.206
you scream in terror, beg
him not to hurt you and run.

19:33.239 --> 19:35.408
Do you think you
can handle that?

19:35.441 --> 19:37.511
Is this some kind of
hospital or something?

19:40.847 --> 19:41.915
Hospital?

19:41.948 --> 19:43.617
Didn't Twinkacetti
told you anything?

19:43.650 --> 19:45.652
[sighs]
Look, I'll wake him up.

19:45.686 --> 19:48.421
You try to look...mean.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.699
Oh, no! Oh, no! It's a burglar!

19:58.732 --> 20:01.367
Balki, look, it's a robber!

20:01.401 --> 20:03.670
Oh, oh, we're
going to be robbed!

20:03.704 --> 20:05.438
And here I am
frozen with fear.

20:05.471 --> 20:08.374
Oh, if only someone with courage
would jump up and save us.

20:08.408 --> 20:09.976
Wait a minute.

20:10.010 --> 20:12.713
What about you?
You can do it, Balki.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.549
Don't be ridiculous.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.317
He's got a gun.

20:19.586 --> 20:20.353
He does?

20:22.889 --> 20:24.858
You're not supposed
to have a gun.

20:25.992 --> 20:26.860
That's real.

20:28.729 --> 20:31.464
Oh! Oh, you're not, uh..

20:31.497 --> 20:33.233
Oh, you're a burglar.

20:34.968 --> 20:37.638
Oh‐h‐h, my God.

20:37.671 --> 20:40.774
Uh, uh‐h, don't
shoot. Please.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.576
I‐I am barely
in my mid 20s.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.477
I have never been skiing.
I didn't mean to offend you.

20:44.511 --> 20:46.913
I love your hat. It's
just that I make a lousy‐‐

20:46.947 --> 20:48.882
‐ Shut up!
‐ I can. I can do that.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.851
I didn't talk through
the entire third grade.

20:50.884 --> 20:52.418
Will you shut up?

20:53.754 --> 20:56.389
You can't do that
to Cousin Larry.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.324
‐ Yes, I can.
‐ Yes, he can.

21:01.427 --> 21:04.364
You do that again
and you're in big trouble.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.900
Balki, if the man wants to
shove me, let him shove me.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.902
‐ There, you heard it.
‐ Yeah.

21:14.675 --> 21:17.277
If you do that
one more time..

21:18.745 --> 21:20.847
...I'm not responsible.

21:24.017 --> 21:25.952
Why do you keep doing that?

21:28.922 --> 21:30.857
Because I'm the one
that's got the gun.

21:30.891 --> 21:32.392
‐ Give me that.
‐ Ooh. Huh.

21:38.899 --> 21:41.768
Alright, buster, reach
for the friendly skies!

21:43.403 --> 21:45.839
Balki, you got the gun.
That's great.

21:45.872 --> 21:47.340
You can put your hands down now.

21:47.373 --> 21:48.374
Even better.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.976
‐ Not you.
‐ Oh.

21:52.579 --> 21:54.347
Down yours, up yours.

22:04.858 --> 22:06.092
What your name is?

22:06.126 --> 22:08.629
Uh, John Doe?

22:09.896 --> 22:11.832
Put your hand out.

22:13.399 --> 22:15.335
Shame on you, John Doe.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.072
Breaking into
other people's houses

22:19.105 --> 22:20.774
and taking things that
don't belong to you!

22:20.807 --> 22:23.744
[gibberish]

22:25.145 --> 22:26.112
Aha!

22:28.815 --> 22:31.518
Yeah, you're right.
Whatever you just said.

22:31.552 --> 22:32.586
Call the police, cousin.

22:32.619 --> 22:34.354
Oh, you bet I will.

22:36.990 --> 22:40.393
Help! Police! Help!

22:40.426 --> 22:42.929
Help! Help! Police!

22:47.433 --> 22:49.002
[instrumental music]

22:50.436 --> 22:52.438
Boy, the police
department was fun.

22:53.674 --> 22:56.042
I like that they
gave me ice‐cream cone

22:56.076 --> 22:59.946
and then, they let me
take my fingerprints.

22:59.980 --> 23:03.416
Don't touch anything
until you wash your hands.

23:03.449 --> 23:04.417
Oh.

23:06.086 --> 23:08.454
They even let me
stand in the line up.

23:08.488 --> 23:11.457
But I didn't win.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.760
It's just as well.
First prize is twenty years.

23:14.995 --> 23:17.598
Well, I'm gonna turn in.

23:17.631 --> 23:19.666
Wait 15 minutes.
I‐I warm up your bed.

23:19.700 --> 23:21.835
No. That is over.

23:21.868 --> 23:24.705
Well, then it's back
to the bag on my head.

23:26.940 --> 23:29.843
Balki, don't you
realize what you've done?

23:29.876 --> 23:31.444
I did something wrong?

23:31.477 --> 23:33.580
No, you saved my life.

23:33.614 --> 23:35.982
You're a hero.
What you did took guts.

23:36.016 --> 23:38.051
‐ Really?
‐ Yes.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.953
Am I as brave as you?

23:39.986 --> 23:42.823
Oh, you, I'm way down here

23:42.856 --> 23:45.959
and you are wa‐a‐ay, way..

23:45.992 --> 23:48.895
We are even.

23:48.929 --> 23:50.496
Equals.

23:50.531 --> 23:53.066
Two peas in a pod.
A couple of primodopoli.

23:55.168 --> 23:57.103
But I don't
feel like a hero.

23:57.137 --> 24:00.240
Somebody was pushing my
friend and I have to stop him.

24:00.273 --> 24:01.842
Well, that's all I
did when I pushed you

24:01.875 --> 24:03.176
out of the way of the taxi.

24:03.209 --> 24:05.646
That's what you do when
you care about somebody.

24:07.213 --> 24:09.149
You‐you care about me?

24:10.050 --> 24:11.151
Well..

24:11.184 --> 24:13.186
I care about you too.

24:13.219 --> 24:14.688
[laughs]

24:14.721 --> 24:17.157
Well..

24:17.190 --> 24:20.093
Thank you...for the service

24:20.126 --> 24:21.862
and for saving my life.

24:22.863 --> 24:26.066
And, uh...goodnight.

24:26.099 --> 24:27.033
Goodnight.

24:33.206 --> 24:36.142
[instrumental music]
