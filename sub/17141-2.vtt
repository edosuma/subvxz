10:39.847 --> 10:43.143
[inhales sharply] Pretty much all I have
to say about that.

10:43.226 --> 10:44.519
Uh, no further questions.

10:44.602 --> 10:47.855
Wait, so, I have the house
to myself tomorrow night.

10:47.939 --> 10:50.525
So? What are you gonna do?

10:50.608 --> 10:52.610
You can't have a party,
'cause you don't have any friends.

10:52.694 --> 10:55.947
Oh! [laughs]
Friendship burn!

10:56.030 --> 10:57.824
Oh! No friends! [laughs]

10:57.907 --> 10:59.242
I have friends.

10:59.325 --> 11:02.662
Mmm, really? 'Cause your diary says
you can't get close to people.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.080
Oh! You read her diary? [laughs]

11:04.164 --> 11:06.208
Yeah, I read her diary!
So good! [chuckles]

11:06.291 --> 11:07.667
You should keep a lock on your diary.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.628
Oh, she put a lock on it,
but I cut that thing right off.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.297
[Jim imitating Emily] "Oh, I'm Emily.

11:12.380 --> 11:15.425
I'm grumpy." [wails]

11:15.508 --> 11:18.636
[imitating Emily] "I love art.
Oh, I love to paint. Look at it."

11:18.720 --> 11:21.514
"Oh! I'm Emily!

11:21.598 --> 11:24.392
I have a diary because I have no friends."

11:24.476 --> 11:26.018
[Miranda gasps] "Oh, dear diary.

11:26.102 --> 11:29.814
I love to eat fruit
and I use really weak locks."

11:29.897 --> 11:32.234
-[chuckles]
-"My name is Emily."

11:34.569 --> 11:35.612
[Jim sighs]

-[indistinct chatter]
-Hello?

11:37.697 --> 11:39.198
-Hi. [chuckles]
-[Owen] Oh, hey.

11:39.282 --> 11:42.494
Uh, you made it.
Everyone, this is Amanda.

11:42.577 --> 11:45.830
No, actually, uh, that's just
Owen's pet nickname for me. [chuckles]

11:45.913 --> 11:47.582
My real name is Miranda.

11:47.665 --> 11:48.708
[chuckles] It is?

11:48.791 --> 11:50.877
Oh, Owen, you're so funny.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.462
Always playing this game
where we call each other

11:52.545 --> 11:54.130
by the wrong name.
[chuckles]

11:54.213 --> 11:56.090
Right, Owen-nifer?

11:56.173 --> 11:57.884
[chuckles] Right.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.552
[Miranda] Great. So, what's this?

11:59.636 --> 12:01.388
[April] Hi.

12:01.471 --> 12:02.764
Uh, I'm April.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.392
So glad you could join us. [chuckles]

12:05.475 --> 12:06.601
Okay.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.770
So, are you an alto or a soprano?

12:09.771 --> 12:10.855
I'm American.

12:10.938 --> 12:13.065
'Kay. Uh, why don't you just, uh,

12:13.149 --> 12:15.318
-join us over this way?
-[Miranda] Oh, okay.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.611
And we'll start right away.

12:16.694 --> 12:18.070
Oh, you know what, actually, um,

12:18.154 --> 12:20.282
I have an announcement
before we get it started. [chuckles]

12:20.365 --> 12:24.994
I just wanna say, please,
don't be intimidated by me.

12:25.077 --> 12:27.580
I can tell by the looks on your faces
you're all freaking out.

12:27.664 --> 12:28.665
You're like, "Oh, my gosh!

12:28.748 --> 12:31.793
This girl's so much prettier and
so much more talented than all of us.

12:31.876 --> 12:32.919
What are we gonna do?"

12:33.002 --> 12:34.086
Just being honest.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.839
This is gonna really help your careers.
Okay?

12:36.923 --> 12:39.384
Maybe I can rub off on you a little bit.

12:39.467 --> 12:42.762
Not, like, physically rub on you,
'cause that'd be weird.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.473
I'm a good girl. [chuckles]
He's watching, so...

12:45.557 --> 12:46.599
Anyways...

12:46.683 --> 12:49.436

No offense.

Just, uh, working from home today.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.543
Okay, I lied.
I didn't get my old job back.

14:36.626 --> 14:39.336
-What?
-I know it's hard to believe,

14:39.421 --> 14:42.424
but your uncle's not in demand
in this current economic climate.

This is pretty much the only place in town
where I'm still allowed to loiter.

14:51.348 --> 14:54.561
Uncle Jim, you need to make some money.
Okay?

14:54.644 --> 14:56.103
-Mom is working double shifts...
-[sighs]

14:56.187 --> 14:58.648
...and she needs someone else's help
to support this family.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.108
Believe me, I have heard all about
your mother's double shifts.

15:01.192 --> 15:02.444
Ever since I've gotten fired,

15:02.527 --> 15:04.737
all she talks about
is money, money, money.

15:04.821 --> 15:07.031
It's like that woman is obsessed.

15:38.688 --> 15:41.315
that my good looks

15:41.398 --> 15:44.694
can be used as a tool
rather than a distraction.

God blessed me with this...

16:02.294 --> 16:04.464
I'd like to pray that a certain person

who recently joined the choir learns
how to be a little less of a nuisance.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.094
[scoffs] Amen.

16:10.177 --> 16:13.139
I'd like to pray for that same person.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.348
I hope you don't mind.

16:14.431 --> 16:15.975
Why would I?

16:16.058 --> 16:20.187
'Cause ever since she got here,
the choir just sounds awful.

16:20.897 --> 16:24.358
And honestly, I feel like God's been
trying to tell me

16:24.441 --> 16:28.488
that something needs to change,
and she just has to leave.

16:28.571 --> 16:29.906
-[all] Amen.
-Yeah.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.201
Uh, you mind if I talk to you in private?

16:34.285 --> 16:36.078
Oh. Uh, sure. Yeah.

16:36.788 --> 16:39.415
We will take your prayer requests
into consideration

16:39.499 --> 16:42.084
and choose the ones we like.
So, thank you.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.086
[all murmuring]

16:44.170 --> 16:46.380
So, you see, Miranda...

16:46.463 --> 16:49.300
it's good to explore all
of the different paths

16:49.383 --> 16:51.803
that God has laid out before us.

16:51.886 --> 16:54.556
Yeah. [chuckles]
That's why I joined the choir.

16:55.723 --> 16:56.724
Yes.

16:56.808 --> 17:01.020
Uh, maybe it's time to...
to explore a quieter path.

17:01.103 --> 17:04.147
You know, one that...
one that doesn't involve music. [chuckles]

17:05.066 --> 17:06.358
Or other people.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.906
Okay. When God closes a door...

17:13.240 --> 17:15.117
he always opens a window.

17:15.201 --> 17:18.829
[stutters] And sometimes,
it's my job to help...

17:18.913 --> 17:21.082
push people out that window.

17:21.999 --> 17:25.127
And I think right now...
[stammering] is one of those times.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.672
You understand?

17:30.257 --> 17:33.469
[impatiently] Okay, I'm trying to say
you're kicked out of the choir, Miranda!

17:33.553 --> 17:37.514
What? You can't do that!
I'm the best part about that choir!

17:37.599 --> 17:40.517
[stammers] I'm sorry, but,
but it's the Lord's will.

17:40.602 --> 17:43.312
No. You know what? No.
This is an outrage!

17:43.395 --> 17:44.480
You can't do this to me!

17:44.564 --> 17:46.816
God is gonna be so ticked off at you
when he hears about this.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.693
You will rue the day.

18:15.052 --> 18:17.513
I think Miranda is
falling for another guy.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.432

is the first person I think of

18:20.516 --> 18:22.935
for dating advice too,
but he's not here.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.440

18:28.524 --> 18:31.235
Yeah, you know,
I'm gonna wait in her bedroom.

touch anything. [chuckles]

what do you think?

Is this a show-stopper?

18:41.453 --> 18:42.454
Yes.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.206
Oh, my gosh! I'm so glad,

18:44.290 --> 18:46.417
because I'm gonna wear it tonight
for singles night.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.501
Don't do that.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.170
Why? What's wrong with it?

18:49.253 --> 18:51.338
It's just a little too revealing.

18:52.173 --> 18:54.842
But it's a turtleneck, and it's... It's--

18:54.926 --> 18:58.721
No, I just mean it reveals
a little too much about your home life.

18:59.764 --> 19:02.934
So should I put a scarf with it?
Or, like, a hat?

19:03.017 --> 19:04.310
Do whatever you want, Mom.

19:04.393 --> 19:07.146
You know, it's just... [sighs]

19:07.229 --> 19:10.107

19:10.191 --> 19:12.026
I cannot hold a thought in my head.

19:12.109 --> 19:14.361
And, anyway, I just don't wanna
mess it up, you know?

19:14.445 --> 19:15.738
So... [clears throat]

19:15.822 --> 19:19.116
I've made these conversation cards
in case I get tongue-tied.

19:19.200 --> 19:22.286
I'm sorry, did you say
"conversation cards"?

19:22.369 --> 19:25.456
You know what, Emily? Never mind.
I'm gonna go practice.

19:25.539 --> 19:27.834

Laugh. Act surprised.

19:32.046 --> 19:35.466
[laughs] "What?
Oh, a little bit about me?

19:36.383 --> 19:37.844
I was married once.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.804
But I consider myself pure...

19:39.887 --> 19:41.973
because I never had the glory moment.

But I'm up-- I'm open to it,
Keith, if you, if you wanted to do that.

Um, okay. What about this?

Um... "Keith, does your family have
a history of genetic diseases?"

19:55.945 --> 19:57.822
No. You can't say that either.

-[sighs]

20:05.496 --> 20:07.123
Mom, you can't say any of these.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.416
Well, then what am I supposed to say?

20:09.500 --> 20:10.793
Will you go with me?

20:11.836 --> 20:14.421
I am your daughter.
I am not going to singles night with you.

20:20.011 --> 20:21.053
Mom, wait up.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.905
[door closes]

20:38.988 --> 20:40.197
Oh.

20:40.281 --> 20:41.991
Hey, EliteCollector423,

20:42.074 --> 20:44.076
-how's it going, my main man?
-Whoa.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.914
-It's me, Jim. From the chatroom?
-Yeah, I know, man.

20:47.997 --> 20:48.998
You wanna hug?

20:49.081 --> 20:50.249
-No. No, man!
-Okay.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.209
-Did you bring the stuff?
-I sure did.

20:52.293 --> 20:56.213
I have a ton of high-quality
collectible items for purchase,

20:56.297 --> 20:58.090
but I gotta warn you, cash only.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.803
-You got it.
-Why don't you step into my office?

21:03.637 --> 21:05.389
Boom!

21:05.472 --> 21:06.473
[EliteCollector423] Let's see.

21:06.557 --> 21:08.267
A dead fern?

21:08.350 --> 21:11.938
I'm pretty sure if you water it,
it'll come back to life.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.649
[EliteCollector423] A picture
of a naked baby in an eggshell?

21:15.732 --> 21:19.195
Yes, I also have pictures
of clothed babies, if you're interested.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.281
A half-used bottle of Jovan Musk?

21:22.364 --> 21:24.616
And you don't wanna know
where I used the other half.

21:26.035 --> 21:28.495
You said you had a bunch
of vintage '80s stuff.

21:28.579 --> 21:29.746
This is all worthless.

21:29.831 --> 21:31.958
Oh, come on, man!
I need money.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.626
There's gotta be something in here
I can sell you.

21:34.710 --> 21:35.752
[gasps] What about this...

21:36.545 --> 21:39.173
nice Aztec-ean patterned shirt?
Would you like--

21:39.256 --> 21:41.801
[stammers]
Please, don't take that off, man.

21:41.884 --> 21:43.260
What about the car?

21:43.344 --> 21:44.678
The car?

21:45.596 --> 21:48.724
I've had this car since I was 18.
I grew up in this car.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.810
I fell in and out of love in this car.

21:50.893 --> 21:55.772
I experienced beauty and pain,
and a spiritual awakening.

21:55.857 --> 21:56.858
And, you--

21:56.941 --> 21:59.526
-I'll give you 500 bucks.
-Sold! No take-backs!

22:01.737 --> 22:02.738
[dog barking]

22:07.994 --> 22:10.371
[sniffles] Mom, where are you?

22:10.454 --> 22:12.748
-[crying] Mom?
-Miranda, are you all right?

22:12.832 --> 22:15.626
I got kicked out of the freaking choir!
Where's Mom?

22:15.709 --> 22:17.169
-Oh, she's not here.
-[grunts]

22:17.253 --> 22:20.965
Uh... But I am,
if you wanna... talk.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.681
-Uh... [chuckles nervously]
-[knocking on door]

22:29.765 --> 22:31.517
Miranda?

22:31.600 --> 22:32.809
What? [sobs]

22:39.191 --> 22:40.401
[Patrick] Hey.

22:43.154 --> 22:45.614
I'm really sorry you got
kicked out of choir.

22:47.074 --> 22:50.286
But... [stutters]
if it makes you feel any better...

22:51.453 --> 22:54.999
I think your singing voice is beautiful,

22:55.082 --> 22:59.211
and pure, and anyone
would be lucky to hear it.

23:02.298 --> 23:04.091
Well, that's because you're smart.

23:17.146 --> 23:19.440
And... I also know...

23:20.774 --> 23:26.738
that sometimes, when two people
are meant to be together...

23:28.115 --> 23:31.577
it doesn't matter what obstacles
are in their way. They just...

23:32.703 --> 23:36.748
They have to fight through
and find a way to make it work.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.505
You're right, Patrick.

23:46.467 --> 23:49.178
I'm gonna go back to that church,
sing my heart out for Owen,

23:49.261 --> 23:50.887
and make him fall in love with me.

23:50.972 --> 23:52.931
Uh, what-- No, I wasn't--
[chuckles nervously]

23:53.015 --> 23:54.808
Thank you.

23:54.891 --> 23:57.103
Uh... Uh...

23:59.730 --> 24:04.652
[gasps] Oh, my goodness,
it's so beautiful!

24:06.278 --> 24:07.279
Oh...

24:09.365 --> 24:11.950
Is this dress too revealing for church?

24:12.034 --> 24:14.703
God has seen you naked, Mom.
I think you're fine.

24:14.786 --> 24:16.288
[Bethany gasps] There's Keith.

24:17.331 --> 24:19.541
-There he is! He's in the blue suit.
-Oh, wow.

24:19.625 --> 24:20.834
-He's running.
-[Bethany] Oh.

24:20.917 --> 24:23.170
[chuckles] Bethany, you made it.

24:23.254 --> 24:24.796
-[laughs] Hey.
-Hi!

24:24.880 --> 24:26.340
[chuckles nervously] Um...

24:28.175 --> 24:29.426
"Good evening, Keith.

24:30.469 --> 24:33.222
How are you?
Do you come to this church often?"

24:33.305 --> 24:35.891
Um, yeah. I work here, remember?

24:35.974 --> 24:37.768
Yes. Okay, sorry, that was a bad one.
"Have you--"

24:37.851 --> 24:40.396
She's just excited to see you.
Hi, I'm Emily. I'm her daughter.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.273
Oh. [chuckles]
Oh, my pleasure to meet you, Emily.

24:42.356 --> 24:44.525
Well, you have your mother's
beautiful eyes. [chuckles]

24:44.608 --> 24:47.028
-[chuckles] Oh.
-And her weak posture. How about that?

24:47.111 --> 24:51.032
[chuckles] Well, would either of you care
for some Blood of Christ fruit punch?

24:51.115 --> 24:52.491
Oh, yes, thank you.

24:52.574 --> 24:53.742
[Keith] Yes, amen.

24:53.825 --> 24:55.327
I'm good. I'm on a blood-free diet.

24:55.411 --> 24:56.745
-[Bethany] Oh.
-[chuckles] Oh.

24:57.871 --> 24:59.665
Well, uh, the music
should be starting up soon.

24:59.748 --> 25:03.294
The choir has prepared some hymns
for us to jam out to. [chuckles]

25:03.377 --> 25:05.462
-Oh, no. The choir?
-Yeah.

25:05.546 --> 25:06.547
Oh, no, my daughter will be here.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.340
Don't let Miranda ruin this for you.

25:08.424 --> 25:10.676
Miranda? Don't have to worry about her.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.844
[chuckles]
Yeah, she decided it would be best

25:12.928 --> 25:15.639
for everyone if she just stayed away
from the choir for a while.

25:15.722 --> 25:18.600
-Really?
-Yeah. Very big of her.

25:18.684 --> 25:19.726
Really?

25:19.810 --> 25:22.646
Well, in that case,
I think we could have some fun.

25:22.729 --> 25:24.231
Well, I think so, too.

25:24.315 --> 25:26.442
-Yes.
-[chuckles] Come with us.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.194
Okay. All right.

25:28.277 --> 25:29.528
-Are you good?
-Go have fun. I'm good.

26:57.158 --> 26:59.201
That's the guy who kicked me
out of the choir!

26:59.285 --> 27:00.869
Okay, well, Miranda, I can explain.
We were--

27:00.952 --> 27:02.078
[Miranda] Okay, why are you even here?

27:02.163 --> 27:04.498
You're not single, you have me!

-Why don't you get out of here?

27:22.558 --> 27:23.559
[Miranda gasps] Okay, you know what?

27:23.642 --> 27:26.603
You know what?
Actually, this night is canceled.

27:26.687 --> 27:30.106
You can all just get out of here
right now, okay?

27:30.191 --> 27:32.276
'Cause this is over.

27:33.235 --> 27:35.028

-Got it.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.790
You're all just a bunch of haters.

27:46.873 --> 27:49.585
That's what you are.
Every single one of you.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.462
And, Mom, you're the worst hater
of them all,

27:51.545 --> 27:53.880
-'cause you're dating this guy.
-All right, all right. That's enough.

27:53.964 --> 27:55.966
-Settle down, settle down.
-Do you know what he did to me?

27:56.049 --> 27:58.176
Settle down, everybody.
This young lady has a point.

27:58.260 --> 27:59.261
-Thank you.
-You have a point.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.222
[Keith chuckles] We are family.

28:01.305 --> 28:02.598
[all murmuring]

28:02.681 --> 28:05.058
We need to take care of each other. Hmm?

28:05.141 --> 28:08.729
Now, now, Owen, would you please
show this lost lamb her way?

28:09.771 --> 28:11.523
-Uh-huh.
-Yes, sir.

but now I'm found."

28:15.319 --> 28:19.114

and I feel all right.

Sexy Christians in black and white.

28:31.752 --> 28:35.881
Can you believe those people?
All I wanted to do was sing you a song.

28:35.964 --> 28:37.508
I know, it's okay.

28:37.591 --> 28:40.386
-Whatever. They're all haters.
-Mmm-hmm.

28:40.469 --> 28:42.012
You're the only one that I care about.
[chuckles]

28:42.095 --> 28:43.264
Yeah, I get that a lot.

28:43.347 --> 28:44.473
[giggles]

28:44.556 --> 28:47.768
So, I was thinking we could
go back to my house and... Whoa.

28:47.851 --> 28:49.270
[door rattling]

28:49.353 --> 28:51.021
Owen, what's going on?

28:51.104 --> 28:52.898
I don't know, it--

28:52.981 --> 28:54.900
You know what?
It's these complicated door locks.

28:54.983 --> 28:57.110
I'm gonna have to go out
and do some research,

28:57.193 --> 28:59.905
figure out how to get this thing open.
I'll be back, okay?

28:59.988 --> 29:02.866
Okay. I'll be here as long as it takes.

29:02.950 --> 29:04.409
I believe in you!

29:18.507 --> 29:20.884
Owen? Oh. It's you.

29:21.802 --> 29:24.095
[sighs] Miranda, what are you
doing out here?

29:31.728 --> 29:32.729
-Come here.
-[tsks]

29:32.813 --> 29:35.732
Okay. Listen, I did not know about Keith.

29:35.816 --> 29:37.150
I would never mean to hurt you.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.820
It's not all about you, Mom.

29:39.903 --> 29:41.947
Everyone's been so mean to me lately.

29:43.949 --> 29:45.701
Do you know what I love about you?

29:47.661 --> 29:49.830
You're so strong.

29:49.913 --> 29:51.665
You don't care what people think

29:51.748 --> 29:55.461
and you're not afraid
to stand up for yourself.

29:57.504 --> 30:00.007
I'm, you know, not like that.

30:01.925 --> 30:03.051
You're right.

30:05.721 --> 30:06.930
You're not like that.

30:11.727 --> 30:13.061
Miranda...

30:14.020 --> 30:16.231
[sighs] If I was like that...

30:17.358 --> 30:19.192
I wouldn't let anyone stop me.

30:30.371 --> 30:31.372
Thanks, Mom.

30:40.964 --> 30:43.550
So this ought to cover the cost
of all the fish I murdered,

30:43.634 --> 30:46.928
and the rest of the five hundie
is yours to keep.

30:47.012 --> 30:50.391
We'll call it a "hiring bonus," huh?
What do you say?

30:51.558 --> 30:53.977
Um, yeah, okay. You're hired.

30:54.060 --> 30:56.480
Yes! Okay, you will not regret this.

30:56.563 --> 30:58.649
I'm gonna start scooping out the floaters.

30:58.732 --> 31:00.108
