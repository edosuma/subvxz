00:57.340 --> 00:59.220
Have you seen my cell phone?

00:59.310 --> 01:00.770
Oh, dear.

01:01.930 --> 01:04.230
Oh, mother of dragons!

01:04.310 --> 01:05.900
What in God's name is happening?

01:05.980 --> 01:09.980
I'm balancing my checkbook!
Which Sol used to do, but now I'm doing it

01:10.070 --> 01:12.150
'cause there's no more Sol, just Frankie.

01:12.230 --> 01:15.400
Don't tell me you haven't done this
since you and Sol broke up.

01:15.490 --> 01:18.910
Now you're sounding like
that nightmare Mindy at Bank of America.

01:18.990 --> 01:22.410
How can I be expected to remember
every check I've ever written?

01:22.500 --> 01:25.250
Yeah. See those stubs? The ones that are
left after you tear the check off?

01:25.330 --> 01:26.750
That's where you're supposed to
put the amount.

01:26.830 --> 01:28.580
That's where I doodle.

01:28.670 --> 01:31.050
You want to see
two squirrels take a bow?

01:34.130 --> 01:35.260
Where's that coming from?

01:35.340 --> 01:36.970
Probably from under one of these piles.

01:37.050 --> 01:39.430
Well, help me find it.
I've got to call Mallory back.

01:39.510 --> 01:41.640
-I can't remember her number.
-Oh.

01:41.720 --> 01:46.060
Where is it? It's not... in you, is it?

01:47.390 --> 01:48.520
That was thrilling.

01:49.690 --> 01:51.770
Oh, it's got syrup on it.

01:51.860 --> 01:54.280
-I had pancakes.
-Did you sit on those, too?

01:54.360 --> 01:56.610
Hi, Mal. I was just gonna call you.

01:56.700 --> 02:00.950
I put the syrup inside like a burrito,
sometimes it squirts out.

02:01.030 --> 02:05.040
-It's how they eat it in France.
-Honey, that's fantastic!

02:05.120 --> 02:08.710
-Oh, my God, that's news. What?
-I didn't even know you guys were trying.

02:08.789 --> 02:11.540
-She's pregnant? Is she pregnant?
-Twins!

02:11.630 --> 02:13.590
Oh! As in two? Oh.

02:13.670 --> 02:16.970
You gotta call your father right now.
This is the kind of news that is--

02:18.050 --> 02:21.100
-Oh.
-Oh, no, she told him first? Oh, no.

02:21.180 --> 02:24.140
No! No, no, no, of course I understand.

02:24.220 --> 02:27.350
-Yeah, I'm sure it cheered him up.
-Of course it cheered him up!

02:27.430 --> 02:29.400
-That's why she told him first.
-Would you sit down?

02:29.480 --> 02:31.690
Congratulations, Mallory!

02:31.770 --> 02:35.900
She says thanks.
Ugh... Wh--

02:35.990 --> 02:38.650
No, w-w-wait a minute,
wait a minute, bed rest?

02:38.740 --> 02:40.280
Bed rest? What does that mean? Tell me.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.450
OK.

02:42.700 --> 02:46.500
No-- Well, no, no, I didn't-- OK.

02:46.580 --> 02:49.500
O-OK. Love to Mitch.

02:49.580 --> 02:52.130
Bye, honey. Congratulations. Yeah.

02:54.130 --> 02:57.970
The doctor put her on bed rest.
Apparently it happens a lot with twins.

02:58.050 --> 03:01.930
Then it's nothing to worry about.
Mazel tov, Grandma.

03:02.010 --> 03:02.930
Thanks.

03:04.010 --> 03:07.520
Yeah. Yeah.

03:10.640 --> 03:13.360
You want more pillows?
Fewer pillows? Different pillows?

03:13.440 --> 03:16.480
-Say something.
-Ah. Stop talking about pillows.

03:16.570 --> 03:18.610
- Hey, hot stuff.
- Jojo.

03:18.690 --> 03:20.950
-Brought you more pillows.
-Thank you.

03:21.030 --> 03:23.410
And you must be Sol.

03:23.490 --> 03:26.620
By now I'm sure you've heard,
I'm Jojo, his flight attendant.

03:29.330 --> 03:31.750
I thought I met all your nurses.

03:31.830 --> 03:34.750
Jojo came on duty last night
while you were sleeping.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.000
Menu, Mary.

03:36.090 --> 03:38.590
I don't think anyone's
ever called me "Mary" before.

03:38.670 --> 03:44.680
- That you heard. Right? Oh.
- Thank you.

03:48.930 --> 03:50.520
What?

03:53.230 --> 03:55.020
Yeah. Take it.

03:55.110 --> 03:56.650
Good morning.

03:56.730 --> 04:00.190
-Hi!
-Ooh, where'd you get that?

04:00.280 --> 04:02.400
What do you care? It fell off a truck.

04:02.490 --> 04:04.240
OK.

04:05.530 --> 04:06.660
I have news.

04:07.370 --> 04:09.330
-I love news.
-I know.

04:09.410 --> 04:12.960
So I drove here to see that face
when I tell you...

04:14.250 --> 04:16.040
Say Grace is going to be
selling your lube.

04:16.130 --> 04:17.540
-My lube?
-Uh-huh!

04:17.630 --> 04:19.589
-In stores?
-It's exciting, right?

04:19.670 --> 04:20.839
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

04:20.920 --> 04:24.300
It's so exciting!
I want nine million dollars.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.430
So do I.

04:28.510 --> 04:30.560
I'll tell you,
I was balancing my checkbook

04:30.640 --> 04:33.100
and nine million dollars
would solve things.

04:34.650 --> 04:36.730
Of course this is how this conversation
is going.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.320
Hi. Your sister's pregnant.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.690
I know. It's kind of her thing.

04:43.150 --> 04:45.610
Oh, everybody knows.

04:45.700 --> 04:46.570
Where are you going?

04:46.660 --> 04:50.080
I could tell she didn't want to ask,
but if Mal's on bed rest,

04:50.160 --> 04:51.290
she's gonna need me.

04:51.370 --> 04:53.790
Well, Brianna wants to sell my lube,

04:53.870 --> 04:56.960
and in return I'm going to get
nine million dollars.

04:57.040 --> 05:00.170
Oh. Someone took their mother's advice.

05:00.250 --> 05:02.590
- Someone is welcome.
- Thank you.

05:02.670 --> 05:05.340
There's a very tasteful
floral arrangement on the way.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.510
Now will you please stay
and help me explain to your roommate

05:07.590 --> 05:10.600
-how business works?
-Oh, I know how business works.

05:10.680 --> 05:13.430
I know I have an idea
and a business wants it.

05:13.520 --> 05:16.690
And another business might want it, too.

05:16.770 --> 05:19.310
Bidding war? Yes, please.
Power lunch? Thank you, Sharks.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.610
I think my roommate
understands business just fine.

05:22.690 --> 05:26.070
Mom? Mommy?

05:28.370 --> 05:32.410
OK. Do you understand that a product

05:32.490 --> 05:36.500
needs to be manufactured
and then marketed?

05:36.580 --> 05:41.340
- And then you need suppliers...
- Oh, I can find suppliers.

05:41.420 --> 05:43.840
-I have a supplier.
-Oh.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.550
Oh, I'm gonna have to pay him, too.

05:45.630 --> 05:49.760
I'm gonna need nine million dollars
and an Orvis gift card.

05:49.850 --> 05:53.560
OK. So I want to start over
and just say I love the lube--

05:56.850 --> 05:59.350
I love the lube which is where

05:59.440 --> 06:02.190
we should--

06:02.280 --> 06:04.780
The company wants to get in business--

06:04.860 --> 06:07.200
I'm just gonna wait 'til you're done.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.700
I'll wait 'til you're finished...

06:08.780 --> 06:10.740
...with... it.

06:21.210 --> 06:24.460
We're playing car wash with Grandma Jean!
We're cars!

06:24.550 --> 06:27.880
I can see that. Who has kisses?

06:29.260 --> 06:30.260
Muah.

06:30.340 --> 06:34.850
Well, will you look who's here!
It's so good to see you!

06:34.930 --> 06:36.680
Oh, hello, Jean.

06:36.770 --> 06:39.190
Oh...

06:39.270 --> 06:41.360
Very long hug.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.150
So what brings you down from Seattle?

06:44.230 --> 06:47.150
Well, Mal asked me to come
and help with the kids,

06:47.240 --> 06:50.360
so I jumped on the first plane
and here I am!

06:50.450 --> 06:54.030
And here you are. And I'm here, too.

06:54.120 --> 06:58.210
-So whenever you need to go back...
-Oh, I can stay as long as she needs.

06:58.290 --> 07:01.960
My house plants are plastic
and my husband's dead.

07:02.040 --> 07:05.090
- Grandma Jean! Grandma Jean!
- The car wash is open!

07:05.170 --> 07:07.050
- Great.
- Wash! Wash!

07:09.880 --> 07:12.680
Hi. I thought I heard you.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.180
-How are you feeling?
-Mom, you didn't have to come.

07:15.260 --> 07:18.980
Of course I did. And I come bearing gifts.

07:19.060 --> 07:22.440
All of <i> Downton Abbey</i>
and a deluxe manicure kit.

07:22.520 --> 07:23.560
Oh, have you read this?

07:23.650 --> 07:25.440
-No.
-The first chapter's tough,

07:25.520 --> 07:28.240
but if you stick with it,
it's smooth sailing.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.900
And if-if not,
there's some <i> Us Weekly's</i> in here, too.

07:30.990 --> 07:33.660
Yes, I will take those.
Right now. Thank you, Mom.

07:33.740 --> 07:36.950
So, I'll-I'll let you rest and I'm gonna
go down and be with the kids.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.450
Yeah, Mom, you don't have to...

07:39.580 --> 07:41.370
because, you know, Jean's here.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.210
Yeah. Jean's here.

07:46.550 --> 07:49.880
-It's just to help with the kids.
-I can help with the kids.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.840
No, I know. I know.

07:51.930 --> 07:54.760
You know,
I know you just don't always love...

07:54.850 --> 07:56.680
when they act like...

07:57.810 --> 07:59.390
kids.

07:59.470 --> 08:02.270
Or it's the thing I love the most.

08:24.250 --> 08:25.750
All right.

08:26.590 --> 08:27.960
-Hey.
-I know we have a lot

08:28.050 --> 08:31.550
of unresolved business,
but I am here as a businesswoman

08:31.630 --> 08:35.429
on business-business.
Someone wants to buy my yam lube,

08:35.510 --> 08:38.929
and I'm here to see about
the yam supply pipeline.

08:39.010 --> 08:42.140
And I-I should tell you that--
Well you should know, I mean,

08:42.230 --> 08:46.270
I did sleep with Sol, so that-that
unresolved business is-is resolved.

08:46.360 --> 08:50.110
I-I also performed his,
uh, marriage ceremony,

08:50.190 --> 08:52.690
which sounds a little ridiculous,
but it was cathartic

08:52.780 --> 08:55.820
is the-the word that gets tossed around--

08:55.910 --> 08:56.990
I'm-I'm losing--

08:57.070 --> 09:00.120
-I'm-I'm off track now, really.
-Start again.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.750
OK, um...

09:02.500 --> 09:06.830
Everything I said,
plus are you still my yam man?

09:06.920 --> 09:11.670
I mean, can I-can I count on you
for the yams for my lube?

09:12.840 --> 09:17.510
I will always have your yams
because I'll always be your yam man.

09:17.590 --> 09:20.510
Well, that's good.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.930
Good. That's good.

09:24.020 --> 09:27.100
I think this business meeting
has gone very successfully

09:27.190 --> 09:31.230
and, uh,
I think the stockholders will be pleased.

09:34.820 --> 09:38.370
Is this how all business meetings end?

09:38.450 --> 09:41.660
-I'm new at this.
-I hope ours always do.

09:41.740 --> 09:43.410
It's nice to see you, Frankie.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.920
It's nice to be seen.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.250
OK.

09:59.220 --> 10:01.510
This one loves herself some fort.

10:08.480 --> 10:12.570
Oh, yeah.
Who wants to read <i> The Velveteen Rabbit?</i>

10:12.650 --> 10:15.240
Nobody!

10:15.320 --> 10:19.780
Well, I know, the first part's tough but
once the little boy gets scarlet fever,

10:19.870 --> 10:21.870
it's smooth sailing.

10:21.950 --> 10:23.330
Maybe not for the rabbit.

10:23.410 --> 10:28.420
Books aren't tons of fun, Grandma Grace.
Forts are fun.

10:28.500 --> 10:31.210
Well, I'd argue books are also fun.

10:31.290 --> 10:33.250
Come into the fort, Grandma.

10:33.340 --> 10:37.880
-Are you kidding?
-You don't have to. I'm here.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.840
OK! I'm coming.

10:42.850 --> 10:45.060
What's the password?

10:45.140 --> 10:47.060
I don't-- Chocolate.

10:47.140 --> 10:49.640
-Nope.
-Worms.

10:49.730 --> 10:52.480
-No.
-Will you give me a hint?

10:52.570 --> 10:55.900
It's the name
of their favorite television show.

10:55.980 --> 10:58.900
I don't know,<i> Trapper John, M.D.</i>

10:58.990 --> 11:02.530
-I'm coming in. Move over.
-It was <i> Zig and Sharko.</i>

11:02.620 --> 11:05.700
-Well, I was close.
-I would've thought you knew that.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.120
I do. I forgot.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.670
Hey, Madison,
you want to have a tea party?

11:10.750 --> 11:14.420
-OK.
-I'm just gonna get my tea. Ah.

11:15.750 --> 11:18.090
That's a lot of tea, Grandma Grace.

11:18.170 --> 11:21.220
Friends who count don't count,
Grandma Jean.

11:21.300 --> 11:23.140
You know who loves tea parties?

11:23.220 --> 11:26.640
Gretchen Gumblehausen!

11:26.720 --> 11:28.680
Ah-choo!

11:28.770 --> 11:32.020
<i>Gesundheit,</i> Gretchen Gumblehausen!

11:33.560 --> 11:37.400
- And I'm...
- Cloris the Clown!

11:37.480 --> 11:42.780
Oh, no, Grace, you're Annie.

11:42.860 --> 11:47.700
No, I'm not a Depression-era orphan
who makes people sad.

11:47.790 --> 11:52.670
I'm Cloris the Clown
who makes people happy!

11:52.750 --> 11:54.790
No, no...

11:54.880 --> 11:56.880
-He's afraid of clowns.
-I thought he was afraid of elves.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.590
He used to be. Now it's clowns.

11:59.670 --> 12:05.300
Well, that's why there's clown spray.
We'll just spray it all over the fort.

12:05.390 --> 12:07.810
You know, you really
should call it anti-clown spray.

12:07.890 --> 12:10.020
I mean, clown spray would attract clowns.

12:10.100 --> 12:12.190
-No, clowns.
-But it doesn't! Right, Grandma Grace?

12:12.270 --> 12:15.650
-Tell Macklin it doesn't.
-Oh, of course not.

12:15.730 --> 12:18.360
Oh, Macklin, I'm-I'm sorry.

12:18.440 --> 12:21.030
I'm sorry.
Clown spray works on all kinds of clowns

12:21.110 --> 12:23.780
and elves and goblins, and--

12:23.860 --> 12:26.870
Uh-oh.
Let's hope it works on something else.

12:29.160 --> 12:31.290
Oh, God. Ugh.

12:33.080 --> 12:36.540
-Well, just get them out!
-Jeez, lice work fast.

12:36.630 --> 12:38.750
They've already built
a town square in here.

12:38.840 --> 12:43.340
Please don't say "lice."
I'm disgusted enough as it is.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.680
Look, these things happen.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.390
When you go near children.

12:47.470 --> 12:50.270
-Oh, you can't be mad at them.
-I'm mad at their hygiene.

12:50.350 --> 12:53.600
Well, to be fair,
you're not a big fan of anybody's hygiene.

12:53.690 --> 12:56.310
None of this would have happened if I
hadn't been rolling around on the ground

12:56.400 --> 13:00.650
-the way Grandma Jean likes to do.
-But that's also what kids like to do.

13:00.730 --> 13:03.860
Kids don't know what they like!
They're dumb!

13:04.900 --> 13:06.700
Oh, God.

13:08.330 --> 13:11.450
That's not something
a grandmother should say.

13:12.450 --> 13:14.000
What is wrong with me?

13:14.080 --> 13:16.170
Come on, you're not so bad.

13:16.250 --> 13:19.040
Some hamsters eat their grandchildren.

13:19.130 --> 13:22.130
Hamsters don't live long enough
to have grandchildren.

13:22.210 --> 13:25.470
Don't confuse me with facts,
I'm going somewhere with this.

13:25.550 --> 13:29.760
Not all hamster grandmas
need to run around in the wood shavings

13:29.850 --> 13:32.850
making forts out of toilet paper tubes.

13:32.930 --> 13:35.810
Some keep the little ones
from eating their poop.

13:35.890 --> 13:39.310
-We all know I'm not the fun hamster.
-Then be who you are.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.530
Be the bossy hamster
with the drinking problem.

13:42.610 --> 13:45.650
They're the ones who inspire their
grandchildren to become writers.

13:45.740 --> 13:48.570
Oh, I'd eat mine before that.

13:49.450 --> 13:51.580
I think I know what would cheer you up.

13:51.660 --> 13:54.540
-A little gossip.
-I hate gossip.

13:54.620 --> 13:55.870
Who's it about?

13:55.960 --> 14:00.340
It's about a certain long-haired beauty
with sparkling eyes and a devilish wit.

14:02.170 --> 14:04.880
-Me. It's about me.
-Let me guess,

14:04.960 --> 14:07.880
you've had another altercation
in your food co-op?

14:07.970 --> 14:11.050
Yes. And I've also recently been kissed.

14:12.470 --> 14:15.640
-By Jacob.
-He kissed you? When?

14:15.730 --> 14:17.600
I ran into him at the farmer's market

14:17.690 --> 14:19.810
when I was stalking him
at the farmer's market.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.820
-How was the kiss?
-Oh, my cheek is still tingling.

14:22.900 --> 14:27.740
But it may have been a power play.
As a businesswoman and a woman-woman,

14:27.820 --> 14:29.490
I'm still unpacking it.

14:30.660 --> 14:32.410
So how did you leave things?

14:32.490 --> 14:35.410
I left it that he would
provide yams for my lube

14:35.500 --> 14:37.660
which I may or may not sell to Brianna.

14:37.750 --> 14:40.210
I have a meeting with her
later this afternoon.

14:40.290 --> 14:42.460
Not sure what I'm gonna do.

14:42.540 --> 14:47.220
Well, figure out where you want to end up
and then don't start there.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.720
With Brianna or Jacob?

14:50.800 --> 14:52.640
Yes.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.600
Is my scalp supposed to be burning?

14:59.560 --> 15:01.310
Mm-- Yes.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.570
<i>- </i><i> That's me on the dance floor.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Mm-hmm.</i>

15:05.650 --> 15:07.320
Oh, that is me about to
get into the swing again.

15:07.400 --> 15:11.910
-Wow. Mm.
-And this is Carlos. Mm-hmm.

15:11.990 --> 15:13.990
Are those shorts or underwear?

15:14.080 --> 15:16.080
Uh, Carlos doesn't wear underwear.

15:16.160 --> 15:19.160
-Sol, you've got to look at Carlos.
-Nah, I'm good.

15:19.250 --> 15:21.170
-You boys like bingo?
-He loves it.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.710
Then when you're all better,

15:23.790 --> 15:27.050
I'm taking you to Drag Queen Bingo!

15:27.130 --> 15:29.050
I'm sure someone's sleeping somewhere.

15:29.130 --> 15:33.090
Oh, none of my patients.
We play, we drink, we sing show tunes.

15:33.180 --> 15:34.550
-I love show tunes.
-Yeah.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.640
Who is that spanking you?

15:36.720 --> 15:39.810
Oh, that's Ana Phylactic-Shock,
she's in charge of Drag Queen Bingo.

15:39.890 --> 15:42.560
-I called a false bingo.
-Ooh, she looks mad.

15:42.650 --> 15:45.110
Nah, she loves spanking people.
Here she's mad.

15:45.190 --> 15:48.990
Someone pretended it was their birthday
and she made them wear nipple clips.

15:49.070 --> 15:50.450
-Ooh.
-OK.

15:50.530 --> 15:51.700
Slide show's over.

15:51.780 --> 15:56.160
And thanks for the invitation, but
I don't think Drag Queen Bingo's for us.

15:56.240 --> 16:00.290
-Oh, why not?
-Well... we're not that kind of gay.

16:01.620 --> 16:04.580
Uh, what kind of gay are you?

16:04.670 --> 16:06.550
Oh, I don't mean there's anything--

16:06.630 --> 16:07.960
I'm gonna go get your breakfast tray.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.720
OK, thanks.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.140
You realize you just offended him?

16:16.220 --> 16:19.180
Why are you suddenly interested
in Drag Queen Bingo?

16:19.270 --> 16:21.640
Why wouldn't I?
I like singing. I like bingo.

16:21.730 --> 16:25.560
I would love to try singing during bingo.
It sounds fabulous.

16:25.650 --> 16:28.570
But you're hardly the Grand Marshal
of the gay parade.

16:28.650 --> 16:31.860
Hey. I'm pretty gay.
In fact, I have a husband.

16:31.950 --> 16:35.530
I have a husband, too. And frankly,
I would say I'm gayer than you.

16:35.620 --> 16:38.950
-How are you gayer than I am?
-I wear a man purse!

16:39.040 --> 16:42.710
That's not gay. That's hideous. And if
you were as gay as I am you'd know that.

16:42.790 --> 16:45.500
All right, Robert, this isn't a contest.

16:45.580 --> 16:48.380
No, it's not. But, seriously,

16:48.460 --> 16:50.510
I would really like for us
to feel comfortable

16:50.590 --> 16:53.840
someday going out to something
like Drag Queen Bingo.

16:53.930 --> 16:57.430
And why not? I spent my whole life
having to look away and pretend

16:57.510 --> 17:01.180
I wasn't interested in things like that,
or Greco-Roman wrestling,

17:01.270 --> 17:02.770
or the Oscar red carpet.

17:02.850 --> 17:04.900
I had a lot of opinions about Cher's dress

17:04.980 --> 17:07.609
when she won for <i> Moonstruck.</i>
I thought it was fantastic!

17:07.690 --> 17:09.690
And I thought Bob Mackie
deserved an Oscar!

17:09.780 --> 17:11.900
-Who's Bob Mackie?
-He designed that dress!

17:11.990 --> 17:14.280
And the people at Drag Queen Bingo
would know that.

17:14.359 --> 17:15.859
See, that's why I want to go.

17:15.950 --> 17:18.829
Hey, we're out. So let's go out.

17:23.869 --> 17:25.079
Oh.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.420
Oh, thank you.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.140
Uh, Ms. Frankie Bergstein is here.

17:41.390 --> 17:43.930
Frankie!

17:44.020 --> 17:47.650
-Hello.
-Oh. So formal.

17:47.730 --> 17:50.690
-Hello. So how was the drive down?
-Oh, good.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.610
Thank you. I parked across the street
so I wouldn't have to valet.

17:53.690 --> 17:55.650
We validate, but OK.

17:55.740 --> 17:58.700
The hand dryer in the men's room
does not work. Like, at all.

17:58.780 --> 18:03.790
I'd like to introduce my legal counsel,
Nwabudike Douglas Bergstein.

18:03.870 --> 18:07.460
Yes, I'm familiar with your son,
who I grew up with.

18:07.540 --> 18:09.580
-Hello, Budlas.
-Oh.

18:09.670 --> 18:11.170
Oh, we're bringing Budlas back?

18:11.250 --> 18:13.130
OK, well, then, hello,
Brianna-donna-ding-dong.

18:13.210 --> 18:16.930
- Never caught on.
- At my house it did.

18:21.010 --> 18:22.850
-Please.
-After you.

18:22.930 --> 18:24.100
No, I insist.

18:24.180 --> 18:27.270
I insist, Brianna-donna-ding-dong.

18:29.270 --> 18:31.150
That's so funny.

18:38.360 --> 18:41.030
-Please take a seat, Frankie.
-No, please, avail yourself.

18:41.120 --> 18:45.790
-Relax, sit down.
-No, no. I insist that you take a seat.

18:54.050 --> 18:57.380
-Did you want to stand, Frankie?
-No, no, please sit.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.090
OK.

19:04.220 --> 19:07.480
-Have you settled?
-I am seated.

19:12.060 --> 19:13.940
Is someone taking minutes?

19:14.020 --> 19:15.940
Um...

19:16.860 --> 19:19.910
- Really?
- Yes. Of course.

19:19.990 --> 19:20.990
Mm-hmm.

19:22.780 --> 19:28.410
OK. "Is someone taking minutes,
comma, um, comma,

19:28.500 --> 19:32.330
really, question mark, yes,
comma, of course."

19:32.420 --> 19:34.750
Oh, I also want to get
"Brianna-donna-ding-dong" in there,

19:34.840 --> 19:36.630
just so we have it.

19:36.710 --> 19:38.010
You don't need to write that down.

19:38.090 --> 19:41.800
So, this deal memo outlines our offer,

19:41.890 --> 19:46.140
namely that Frankie Bergstein,
creator and owner of said lubricant,

19:46.220 --> 19:49.680
shall receive a $25,000 buyout.

19:49.770 --> 19:54.230
Wow. And three percent of the net
once we're profitable.

19:54.310 --> 19:55.650
I want nine million dollars.

19:55.730 --> 19:59.240
-Fuck my life. Fuck it hard.
-I am so glad I came to work today.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.740
-So, um, my mother--
-No.

20:01.820 --> 20:05.990
My client is interested in a licensing
deal and two percent of the gross.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.660
Two is less than three.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.500
But gross is much larger than net,
and with the licensing deal

20:10.580 --> 20:12.170
you'll get a piece
of every single unit sold.

20:12.250 --> 20:14.880
Licensing and two percent of the gross.
Done.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.050
Why? What do you know?

20:18.130 --> 20:21.930
I know that there's a fantastic offer
on the table for your client-slash-mother.

20:22.010 --> 20:24.220
-And?
-And my company's taking a big risk

20:24.300 --> 20:26.600
-investing in an unknown product.
-Aha!

20:26.680 --> 20:28.260
Your eyebrow arches when you lie.

20:28.350 --> 20:30.270
Your head tilts, your eyes crinkle,

20:30.350 --> 20:32.390
and somehow your hair turns
a darker shade of blonde-ish.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.770
Fine. We may have done some testing,
and it may have gone well--

20:34.850 --> 20:36.400
-Ah-ha-ha!
-Two-point-five and that's it.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.570
- Three.
- Deal.

20:38.650 --> 20:40.610
But that is not where I want to end up.

20:40.690 --> 20:44.030
- Twist.
- Well, it's a good deal, Mom.

20:44.110 --> 20:47.030
And, uh, we should talk about it,
but I think you should take it.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.870
Oh, I can't. I want more.

20:48.950 --> 20:53.290
Like what?

20:58.960 --> 21:01.670
Your client's gone rogue.

21:01.760 --> 21:05.510
My client would be more than happy
to shop her product elsewhere.

21:05.590 --> 21:09.810
Oh, have fun with your weird mother-son
vaginal lube sales team.

21:09.890 --> 21:12.140
That is definitely going in the minutes.

21:12.230 --> 21:14.020
-Dude, expunge that.
-Nope.

21:14.100 --> 21:16.020
-Mom, mom...
-Hm-mm.

21:21.030 --> 21:23.610
Why aren't you downstairs playing
with Madison and Grandma Jean?

21:23.700 --> 21:26.950
Because Mommy needs clown spray
so she's not scared.

21:27.030 --> 21:30.280
Why would-- Macklin, come here.

21:31.620 --> 21:34.540
Why on earth would Mommy be scared?

21:34.620 --> 21:38.290
-Because she's sick.
-Mommy's not sick.

21:39.420 --> 21:44.470
But Grandma Jean had us
make get-well cards for Mommy

21:44.550 --> 21:49.510
because she's sick because there's not
enough room in her tummy for two babies.

21:49.600 --> 21:54.350
First of all, homemade cards are great,
but only if you put in a lot of effort.

21:54.430 --> 21:58.400
And second, babies don't grow in Mommy's
tummy, they grow in a separate part

21:58.480 --> 22:01.480
-that only mommies have.
-Her pocketbook?

22:01.570 --> 22:03.570
Not quite.

22:03.650 --> 22:06.490
Look,
Mommy's not scared and she's not sick.

22:06.570 --> 22:10.780
She-she just needs a little extra sleep
so the babies will grow big and strong.

22:10.870 --> 22:13.660
So Grandma Jean was wrong?

22:16.000 --> 22:17.960
Yes.

22:18.040 --> 22:21.750
If Mommy's not scared,
I'm not scared, either.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.130
Well, good. That-- Ew. Sticky. Ew.

22:25.220 --> 22:27.180
Can I lay down with her?

22:27.260 --> 22:30.260
First of all, it's "lie."
Second of all, no, you can't,

22:30.340 --> 22:32.140
because we don't want to give Mommy lice.

22:35.140 --> 22:37.230
But I'll tell you what we can do.

22:37.310 --> 22:39.440
-Gin!
-Aw, man.

22:39.520 --> 22:42.770
You saw me play the ace of clubs,
you have to pay attention.

22:51.990 --> 22:53.870
What do you think of this figure?

22:53.950 --> 22:56.450
Boobless? I taught you that.

22:56.540 --> 22:58.920
Also "boobs," "boob," and "boobies."

22:59.000 --> 23:00.420
I know how to write "hillbillies."

23:00.500 --> 23:02.840
53177187714.

23:02.920 --> 23:05.210
- Say that again, but slower.
- I know what I want.

23:05.300 --> 23:07.090
-Oh.
-This ought to be good.

23:07.170 --> 23:09.970
I want six percent of the gross,
I want my art on the box,

23:10.050 --> 23:11.890
and I want you to take me seriously.

23:11.970 --> 23:15.180
I am trying to,
it's kind of a challenge sometimes.

23:15.270 --> 23:18.810
That's my process.
You want my lube? You get my process.

23:20.350 --> 23:21.480
OK, fine.

23:21.560 --> 23:24.940
Then you'll listen to my ideas?
Because I have lots of ideas.

23:25.020 --> 23:27.650
Yes. The good ones.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.320
This is where normally
when I would give you a hug,

23:29.400 --> 23:31.910
but I know you're a very serious
businesswoman, so...

23:32.700 --> 23:33.700
Muah.

23:34.700 --> 23:37.660
Will I get my nine million dollars?

23:37.750 --> 23:40.710
If every man, woman and child
in America buys your lube, then yes,

23:40.790 --> 23:42.250
you will get your nine million dollars.

23:42.330 --> 23:44.090
Victory!

23:51.510 --> 23:53.090
Wow.

23:54.550 --> 23:55.550
Forgot our bags.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.400
What have I done?

24:10.820 --> 24:12.490
That was a nice break.

24:12.570 --> 24:15.160
I didn't know it was the morgue,
I thought it was the atrium.

24:15.240 --> 24:18.450
-That's what it said on the map.
-Please, just get me back to the room.

24:18.540 --> 24:21.910
Jojo, can you help me for a second?

24:27.880 --> 24:30.420
-Let's get ready to bingo!
-Whoo!

24:30.510 --> 24:33.890
Bitch, what are you doing here?

24:33.970 --> 24:36.720
Bitch, I'm here to play bingo!
This bitch invited me.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.970
What is going on, Sol?

24:39.060 --> 24:41.480
I'm saying I'm sorry to both of you.

24:43.020 --> 24:44.230
Bitch.

24:44.310 --> 24:46.610
Jeez!

24:48.770 --> 24:50.940
Raise your hand if you love Ryan Gosling.

24:51.030 --> 24:52.320
Oh!

24:52.400 --> 24:54.860
Now raise your hand if you can't
come within 200 feet of him.

24:54.950 --> 24:57.700
It ain't love
unless the police get involved.

24:59.290 --> 25:00.540
Oh, I'm lying because I've--

25:00.620 --> 25:04.790
<i>♪ Never been in love B-4 ♪</i>

25:04.870 --> 25:08.670
<i>♪ Now all at once it's you ♪</i>

25:08.750 --> 25:13.130
<i>♪ It's you forever more ♪</i>

25:13.220 --> 25:15.010
Sounds like you and Mack were having fun.

25:15.090 --> 25:16.970
Yeah, we were.

25:17.050 --> 25:18.760
Are you surprised?

25:18.850 --> 25:19.850
Not at all.

25:19.930 --> 25:22.930
Because, uh, you didn't call me
to come help with the kids.

25:23.020 --> 25:25.940
Mom, Jean jumped on a plane.

25:26.020 --> 25:30.320
Huh, and, uh, you told your father
first that you were pregnant.

25:30.400 --> 25:33.490
To cheer him up. I was dying
to tell you, Mom. I called you.

25:33.570 --> 25:35.860
And left a message
with no hint of any news.

25:35.950 --> 25:38.160
I didn't want to tell you in a message.

25:38.240 --> 25:39.830
Well, you know something, it felt...

25:40.620 --> 25:42.790
like you didn't really
want to tell me at all.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.540
Mom, of course I did.

25:46.460 --> 25:49.380
I just...

25:50.380 --> 25:52.170
OK, um...

25:53.260 --> 25:55.130
Remember when you and Dad had brunch

25:55.220 --> 25:57.430
at the house after Madison's christening?

25:57.510 --> 25:59.550
You stood in the kitchen making egg salad

25:59.640 --> 26:04.310
and you said this better be my last baby
because I needed to start my life again.

26:04.390 --> 26:07.940
- I didn't say that.
- Mom, I remember what you were wearing.

26:13.360 --> 26:15.240
I'm so sorry.

26:16.490 --> 26:20.660
You know, sometimes
I wonder who I was in that house.

26:20.740 --> 26:22.620
I don't know why I was holding onto that.

26:22.700 --> 26:26.660
Because it's horrible.
I never should have said that.

26:29.170 --> 26:31.880
I'm really happy you're pregnant.

26:31.960 --> 26:34.960
And those babies are really lucky

26:35.050 --> 26:38.510
because you're the best mother I know.

26:38.590 --> 26:41.720
Mom, I learned from you.

26:45.430 --> 26:47.060
Thank you for lying.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.780
Hey, why is that not happening
in your studio?

27:00.870 --> 27:03.580
Oh, I still haven't
gone through my moving boxes.

27:03.660 --> 27:07.960
Great. You're one can of cat food
away from full-on <i>Grey Gardens.</i>

27:08.040 --> 27:09.870
Oh, how did it go with Brianna?

27:09.960 --> 27:13.500
Well, I figured out where I wanted
to end up and I got there.

27:13.590 --> 27:14.800
How did it go with Mallory?

27:15.920 --> 27:17.340
We're finding our way.

27:17.420 --> 27:21.680
You think I can get them
to let me name the lube "Vagicadabra"?

27:21.760 --> 27:23.600
Because I have other names.

27:23.680 --> 27:28.310
"Slip Inside,"
"Lubri-can," "Menapplause."

27:29.190 --> 27:31.100
"Yam, Bam, Thank You, Ma'am"?

27:31.190 --> 27:32.860
We'll throw that one in...

27:32.940 --> 27:34.730
-Yeah.
-...so they'll pick one of mine.

27:34.820 --> 27:35.820
They're going to name it

27:35.900 --> 27:38.320
the "Frankie Bergstein Memorial Lube!"

27:38.400 --> 27:40.490
-Now with lice.
-Let me have it!

27:40.570 --> 27:43.370
I would love to host life.

27:43.450 --> 27:45.370
What is that?

27:46.540 --> 27:48.750
Well, according to the deal
we hammered out with the lube,

27:48.830 --> 27:50.660
they're putting my art on the box.

27:50.750 --> 27:53.330
-And I know what I want to paint.
-What?

27:54.670 --> 27:55.840
My vagina.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.010
Well, if they're going to
take my face off the box,

27:59.090 --> 28:01.050
I'm glad they're replacing it
with your vagina.

28:01.130 --> 28:04.050
Well, at least you won't have to worry
about being recognized in public.

28:05.050 --> 28:06.060
No...

28:07.220 --> 28:08.810
but you might.
