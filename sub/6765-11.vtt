WEBVTT

00:08.476 --> 00:09.670
Kelly, come on.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.701
Tell me who's negotiating
your contract.

00:11.746 --> 00:13.611
Steve, there
is no contract.

00:13.648 --> 00:16.412
There's no agent.
There's no big deal.

00:16.451 --> 00:18.612
They're just taking
a couple pictures of me.

00:18.653 --> 00:21.850
Excuse me. Seventeen magazine
is a big deal okay?

00:21.889 --> 00:23.720
And everybody knows they pay
their models top dollar.

00:23.758 --> 00:25.191
Steven, for
the last time,

00:25.226 --> 00:26.284
l'm not a model.

00:26.327 --> 00:27.487
l'm just a
college student.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.688
That's why they picked me.

00:28.729 --> 00:31.391
That's why they're taking
the pictures here on campus.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.332
They picked you
because you'll work cheap.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.698
Thank you,
Mr. Show Biz.

00:34.735 --> 00:35.827
Uh-huh, okay,

00:35.870 --> 00:37.895
well, this Mr. Show Biz kept
the Peach Pit alive

00:37.939 --> 00:40.203
long after people thought
it'd be dead in the water, okay?

00:40.241 --> 00:41.208
Yeah, right.

00:41.242 --> 00:43.836
All you did was go and ask
your dad for a loan.

00:43.878 --> 00:45.277
Believe me,
just mentioning that to him

00:45.313 --> 00:46.803
cost me major
deal points, Kelly.

00:46.848 --> 00:48.145
What's he doing here?

00:48.182 --> 00:51.777
He's being motivational,
l guess. Who knows?

00:51.819 --> 00:54.287
-Today's the last game
of Tournament '94. -Ah.

00:54.322 --> 00:56.256
He's some piece
of work, Steve.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.689
Rush? No!

00:57.725 --> 00:59.852
Well, there he is,
Stevie Wonder!

00:59.894 --> 01:01.862
So nice you could join us,
sonny boy.

01:01.896 --> 01:02.828
Stevie...

01:02.864 --> 01:04.263
l'll kill you.
Where are you going?

01:04.298 --> 01:05.322
To be presidential.

01:05.366 --> 01:06.390
When are you coming back?

01:06.434 --> 01:09.096
Five minutes. l'll
meet you on the field.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.331
How come you keep coming

01:10.371 --> 01:11.463
to these Student
Senate meetings

01:11.506 --> 01:12.632
if nobody else
ever comes?

01:12.673 --> 01:13.833
Force of habit, l guess.

01:13.875 --> 01:14.842
l'm sorry.

01:14.876 --> 01:16.104
lt's not so bad.

01:16.144 --> 01:18.612
l just bang my gavel
and go.

01:18.646 --> 01:20.375
You can bang my
gavel anytime.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.881
Mm, don't mind if l do.

01:21.916 --> 01:24.976
Hang with me for two seconds.
This won't take long.

01:26.487 --> 01:29.012
l refuse to be called
a racist, Janice!

01:29.056 --> 01:30.990
She didn't call
you a racist, Levy!

01:31.025 --> 01:32.014
l did!

01:32.093 --> 01:33.219
Walsh is here.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.888
Let's get started.

01:34.929 --> 01:36.794
Excellent.

01:36.831 --> 01:38.128
l think this is gonna

01:38.166 --> 01:40.259
take a little longer
than two seconds.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.734
Yeah.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:47.101 --> 02:49.433
Andrea, you're
out of wipes.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.869
-Oh, here they are, Grandma.
-Oh!

02:50.905 --> 02:52.031
There's some diapers
underneath.

02:52.106 --> 02:53.971
Uh, you know, l expressed
two bottles of milk.

02:54.008 --> 02:55.032
They're in the fridge.

02:55.076 --> 02:57.567
And Jesse said he'd be home
no later than 7:00.

02:57.612 --> 02:59.045
My Hadassah meeting
starts at 7:00.

02:59.080 --> 03:01.048
Well, l'll call you from
the library at 6:00.

03:01.148 --> 03:02.979
lf he's not here,
l'll just come home.

03:03.017 --> 03:04.279
Don't rush on my account.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.946
All those ladies do is gab for
the first 20 minutes anyway.

03:06.988 --> 03:08.216
Thanks, Grandma.

03:08.256 --> 03:10.952
And you have fun
with your Rosie, okay?

03:10.992 --> 03:13.984
You know, Hannah's looking
more like Eli every day.

03:14.028 --> 03:14.995
Who's Eli?

03:15.096 --> 03:16.461
Sadie's son.

03:16.497 --> 03:17.725
You never mentioned him.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.892
He was a happy little boy.

03:19.934 --> 03:21.265
l was his babysitter.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.998
He died in the camps.

03:24.105 --> 03:27.131
Sweetie, oh,
you're so beautiful.

03:27.174 --> 03:29.836
lt's no secret

03:29.877 --> 03:33.108
that the Jews on Wall Street
control the banks

03:33.147 --> 03:36.674
in this country, that
they control the media,

03:36.717 --> 03:40.118
the Congress,
the State Department;

03:40.154 --> 03:43.521
the whole kosher pickle.

03:43.557 --> 03:48.187
And if you dare to question
the scope of their influence,

03:48.229 --> 03:51.528
they call you ''anti-Semite''
and demand a public apology.

03:51.565 --> 03:56.593
Well, when have they apologized

03:56.637 --> 03:57.934
for buying up the slums

03:57.972 --> 04:00.873
of our cities and charging
the highest of rents

04:00.908 --> 04:03.172
to the poorest of our black
brothers and sisters?

04:03.210 --> 04:04.837
When have they apologized

04:04.879 --> 04:08.212
for sucking the life's blood
out of our communities?!

04:08.249 --> 04:13.915
The fact, is l have never heard
one Jew apologize

04:13.954 --> 04:17.890
for the 250 million Africans
that died in the holds

04:17.925 --> 04:20.223
of their slave ships
during the Middle Passage.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.694
This is just a sampling

04:21.728 --> 04:24.994
of the pernicious lies
that Reverend Turner...

04:25.032 --> 04:26.897
That speech is five years old.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.835
Turner's comments were taken
completely out of context.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.805
And what kind of context could
you possibly put them in?

04:32.840 --> 04:36.276
l move that this Senate take
action now to ban Roland Turner

04:36.310 --> 04:38.335
from appearing on this campus
Friday night.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.472
-Yeah, and l second it.
-Since when

04:40.514 --> 04:42.778
does the Maccabee Center get
to decide who the Black

04:42.817 --> 04:45.308
Student Union can or can't
invite to speak on this campus?

04:45.353 --> 04:47.014
Since part
of my tuition goes

04:47.121 --> 04:48.588
to finance
this Student Government.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.589
Excuse me.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.353
The B.S.U. is paying Reverend
Turner out of

04:52.393 --> 04:54.258
-our own discretionary funds.
-But it's still

04:54.295 --> 04:56.525
University money that's being
used to sponsor a demagogue...

04:56.564 --> 04:59.260
Hey! Who made you the head
of the thought police?

05:01.135 --> 05:02.966
Let's have some order,
please, people.

05:03.003 --> 05:07.303
The First Amendment protects
the right of free speech,

05:07.341 --> 05:09.741
and that is what
is at stake here.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.742
That's all that's at stake here.

05:13.781 --> 05:16.875
Look, obviously this is
a very emotional issue,

05:16.917 --> 05:19.442
and l don't think we're
going to get anywhere...

05:19.487 --> 05:22.183
Point of order,
Mr. President,

05:22.223 --> 05:23.986
but a motion's been put
on the floor.

05:24.058 --> 05:27.221
Well, l'm tabling that motion,
Alex, pending further study.

05:27.261 --> 05:28.853
Take the vote, man!

05:30.030 --> 05:32.999
Meeting's adjourned.
We'll reconvene at 2:00.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.000
Let's go, Kel.

05:34.068 --> 05:36.298
That's our
fearless leader.

05:36.337 --> 05:38.305
You can't run away

05:38.339 --> 05:39.966
-from this, Brandon.
-You didn't think

05:40.007 --> 05:41.406
that Walsh would
actually have an opinion

05:41.442 --> 05:43.933
without checking with the
Chancellor first, did you?

05:44.979 --> 05:47.379
You're a funny guy, Alex.

05:55.289 --> 05:59.988
Dr. Revez to Radiology.
Dr. Revez to Radiology.

06:02.596 --> 06:03.722
Good morning,

06:03.764 --> 06:05.959
or should l say
good afternoon?

06:06.033 --> 06:09.059
Where am l?

06:09.103 --> 06:11.435
They moved you
to a private room.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.599
That's a good sign,
don't you think?

06:13.641 --> 06:15.973
l think it's a very
good sign indeed.

06:16.076 --> 06:20.410
Though, l'm definitely not
happy about the room number.

06:20.448 --> 06:22.780
We need to get you
into a ''four.''

06:22.817 --> 06:25.183
A ''four'' will bring
your life path

06:25.219 --> 06:28.484
into a much
healthier balance.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.888
A few of your friends
dropped by.

06:30.925 --> 06:32.950
l don't want to see anybody.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.654
Not even Valerie?

06:34.695 --> 06:37.186
Especially not Valerie.

06:37.231 --> 06:38.528
Oh, have a heart, Dylan.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.932
She's been keeping a
round-the-clock vigil,

06:40.968 --> 06:43.528
and she definitely has
a healing aura...

06:43.571 --> 06:44.663
Stay out of it.

06:44.705 --> 06:47.538
l'm sorry.
l'm sorry.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.805
This is no time
to upset you,

06:49.844 --> 06:54.474
but, um, there is someone
who needs to speak to you.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.176
Hello, Dylan. l'm Jamie Young.

06:56.217 --> 06:59.209
l was on call in the emergency
room when you were brought in.

06:59.253 --> 07:01.221
Jamie's a
medical student,

07:01.255 --> 07:04.053
and she's doing some
fabulous research on dreams.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.719
Well, specifically,
we're studying patients

07:06.760 --> 07:08.387
who've had
near-death experiences,

07:08.429 --> 07:11.227
to see what they can remember
when they were unconscious.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.926
What's your hurry, son?

07:12.967 --> 07:15.265
I'll pray for your soul.

07:15.302 --> 07:18.669
l don't remember anything.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.840
-Okay, great.
-Okay, take care.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.037
Thanks a lot.

07:25.446 --> 07:27.243
What'd they say?

07:27.281 --> 07:28.714
Chancellor Arnold's leaving
for a retreat tonight,

07:28.749 --> 07:30.114
but Dean Whitmore offered

07:30.150 --> 07:32.118
to bring all the parties
together for a powwow.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.119
Well, that's good.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.121
But we all agreed

07:35.155 --> 07:36.247
the Administration
shouldn't get involved

07:36.290 --> 07:38.087
until after the
Senate votes.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.116
Why would you do that?

07:40.160 --> 07:41.991
Because the Student Government's
supposed to be autonomous.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.087
We should be able to work
it out by ourselves.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.189
Well, you will.

07:45.232 --> 07:46.665
With Alex Diaz
calling the shots?

07:46.700 --> 07:49.828
Yeah, he did seem to be playing
one side against the other.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.303
Exactly.

07:51.338 --> 07:52.532
He knows the Review
Board's going

07:52.573 --> 07:54.598
to meet in the next couple
of weeks to decide

07:54.642 --> 07:56.769
whether or not l have
the right to be President,

07:56.810 --> 07:59.779
and this is his way of showing
how little support l have.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.303
Well, you have me.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.714
And don't forget how persuasive
you can be one-on-one.

08:03.751 --> 08:05.218
Does that mean
l can persuade you

08:05.252 --> 08:06.514
to go back to
your apartment

08:06.554 --> 08:08.920
for a little game of
slap and tickle, hmm?

08:08.956 --> 08:11.891
Don't you have
a football game?

08:11.926 --> 08:13.291
Oh, my God!

08:19.266 --> 08:21.359
Muntz, how bad
was it, man?

08:21.402 --> 08:24.166
l stopped counting at 35-7,
and that was halftime.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.798
Hey, Mr. Punctuality,
so glad you could make it.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.068
Steve, l'm real
sorry, man.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.973
Oh, it's cool. Now everybody
knows you're a flake.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.637
l'm not the flake
in this picture.

08:31.679 --> 08:32.736
Hey, don't
worry about it.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.441
Even Rush said these guys
are practically semipro.

08:34.481 --> 08:35.448
Rush took it okay?

08:35.482 --> 08:36.539
He's talking
basketball now.

08:36.583 --> 08:37.982
l won't be on that team.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.486
Ah, who cares if their tight end
could leap tall buildings

08:43.524 --> 08:45.992
in a single bound--
they were lucky, too.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.755
The only one who was
lucky was Brandon

08:47.795 --> 08:50.127
for not being there.

08:50.164 --> 08:52.655
Uh-huh. See this gaze,
see the clenched jaw?

08:52.700 --> 08:54.224
l've come
to recognize these signs.

08:54.268 --> 08:55.701
He's in a political mode
right now.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.135
Listen, l'm real sorry
about the game,

08:57.171 --> 08:59.230
but l'll see you guys
later, okay?

08:59.273 --> 09:00.262
Bye, bud.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.939
Mind if l join you?

09:05.980 --> 09:07.607
Why not?

09:07.648 --> 09:09.639
lt's still a free
country, isn't it?

09:09.683 --> 09:12.516
Look, Janice, l know
you're a major part

09:12.553 --> 09:13.884
of this Senate boycott
with Diaz.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.855
One thing has nothing
to do with the other.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.516
Sure, it just happens
to be a coincidence

09:17.558 --> 09:19.185
that you've laid all
this on my lap

09:19.226 --> 09:21.251
after you haven't been
to a meeting in two months.

09:21.295 --> 09:24.287
Brandon, don't look
for a grand conspiracy here.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.629
This month marks
the 25th anniversary

09:26.667 --> 09:28.464
of the Black Student Union
on this campus,

09:28.502 --> 09:29.867
which is something

09:29.903 --> 09:32.303
every African-American
at C.U. is very proud of.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.136
And we've been planning
a broad spectrum

09:34.174 --> 09:36.699
of cultural events, such
as folk dancers from Senegal

09:36.744 --> 09:38.234
and poetry readings.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.371
And a keynote address by one of
the most controversial men

09:40.414 --> 09:41.438
in America.

09:41.482 --> 09:45.475
Hey, l wanted Anita Hill
to come, but l was outvoted,

09:45.519 --> 09:47.111
so l went with the majority.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.314
That's how a democracy works.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.823
But Turner's ideas
are so extreme.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.519
They used to say the same thing

09:52.559 --> 09:55.357
about Malcolm and Dr. King
and Marcus Garvey.

09:55.396 --> 09:58.365
You've heard of Marcus Garvey,
haven't you?

09:58.399 --> 10:02.358
Marcus Garvey, he was,
uh, big, tall guy.

10:02.403 --> 10:04.030
Didn't he play
for the Houston Rockets?

10:05.839 --> 10:08.603
Very funny.

10:08.642 --> 10:12.009
Look, Janice, maybe we can
come up with some way

10:12.079 --> 10:14.570
to make this whole Turner
business a little less volatile.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.742
-Now, what did you have in mind?
-Well, l'm just

10:16.784 --> 10:19.810
thinking out loud now, but what
if the university still paid

10:19.853 --> 10:22.185
for the speech,
but we held it off campus?

10:22.222 --> 10:24.986
Like maybe in Compton
or South Central?

10:25.025 --> 10:26.925
You know what l mean.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.554
What if a bunch of Nazi
skinheads wanted to hold a rally

10:29.596 --> 10:30.927
right here in the quad, huh?

10:30.964 --> 10:33.990
At the law school we have
a saying:

10:34.034 --> 10:37.765
''You're either down with the
First Amendment or you're not.''

10:37.805 --> 10:39.602
You know what i mean?

10:40.941 --> 10:44.377
Yeah, l know what you mean.

10:47.648 --> 10:51.243
You know, my horoscope always
says the same damn thing.

10:51.285 --> 10:52.377
What's it say?

10:52.419 --> 10:54.353
''Accent the unorthodox.

10:54.388 --> 10:58.916
Use elements of timing and
surprise to get what you want.''

10:58.959 --> 11:00.586
Well, what do you want?

11:01.829 --> 11:03.091
Faucet's fixed.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.893
All it needed was a new washer.

11:07.301 --> 11:08.268
What?

11:08.302 --> 11:09.269
No, it's nothing.

11:09.303 --> 11:11.430
We were just, um,
reading our horoscopes.

11:11.472 --> 11:13.235
So, what's your sign?

11:13.273 --> 11:14.706
Uh, Scorpio.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.341
Hey, that's this month.

11:18.378 --> 11:19.743
Yeah, l know.

11:19.780 --> 11:20.940
So, when's your birthday?

11:20.981 --> 11:21.948
Friday.

11:21.982 --> 11:22.971
Friday?

11:23.016 --> 11:24.916
We're having a party.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.920
No, we won't.
Yes, we are.

11:26.954 --> 11:28.615
No, l'm serious.
The last thing l need

11:28.655 --> 11:30.520
is to be reminded of how old
l'm getting.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.821
Exactly how old are you, Ray?

11:33.927 --> 11:35.622
25.

11:35.662 --> 11:37.220
Really?

11:37.264 --> 11:40.495
Geez, you're practically
robbing the cradle, Ray.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.365
l'm almost 20, thank you.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.768
Well, l'm almost past my prime.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.670
No, you're not.

11:46.707 --> 11:50.040
Friday, 8:00.
We're having a party.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.668
Donna...
Shh!

11:51.712 --> 11:53.737
lt's a surprise.

11:53.781 --> 11:56.215
l'm accenting the unorthodox.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.152
Andrea, right?

12:04.191 --> 12:05.818
Andrea Zuckerman.

12:05.859 --> 12:09.454
Noah Levy.
From the Maccabee Center.

12:09.496 --> 12:12.863
l was friends with Dan Rubin.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.300
Right. Sure. Hi.

12:15.335 --> 12:18.668
Hey. So, uh, what are you
up to these days?

12:18.705 --> 12:20.002
Uh, n-nothing much.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.200
l've got a physics mid-term
to study for tomorrow,

12:22.242 --> 12:24.005
and a baby l've got
to get home to.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.442
You have a baby?

12:25.479 --> 12:27.174
Yeah. l'm married.
Got a baby.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.738
lt's been a big year. Um...

12:28.782 --> 12:32.218
Look, it was nice seeing you
Noah, but l've gotta go.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.344
l'm crazed.

12:33.387 --> 12:35.014
You know, l'm pretty
crazed myself.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.953
You take care.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.480
Are you still friends
with Brandon Walsh?

12:38.525 --> 12:41.551
Uh, yeah, he's the
godfather of my daughter,

12:41.595 --> 12:43.790
See, then, maybe you could
use your influence with him

12:43.831 --> 12:46.163
to help keep Roland Turner
from speaking on this campus.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.633
Turner's going
to speak at C.U.?

12:47.668 --> 12:48.657
Friday night.

12:48.702 --> 12:50.567
And the Senate votes
on it tomorrow.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.469
l will definitely give
Brandon a call,

12:52.506 --> 12:54.770
but l have to go home
and meet my grandma.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.673
Thanks, but before you go,

12:56.710 --> 12:59.144
take a look at this videotape
we have of Turner,

12:59.179 --> 13:02.444
and you'll understand
why l came to you.

13:02.482 --> 13:03.710
Okay.

13:11.725 --> 13:12.953
Hey, what a pleasant
surprise.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.962
Hi. l know it's late and l
should've called first, but l...

13:15.996 --> 13:17.395
Come on in.

13:17.431 --> 13:18.398
Thanks.

13:18.432 --> 13:19.865
Hey, you know
you're always welcome here.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.095
l thought l heard a familiar
voice. How's Hannah?

13:22.135 --> 13:23.363
Fine.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.996
Hey, chief.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.370
Thought you'd be
at home cramming.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.308
Yeah, me, too. Um, Brandon, can
l talk to you for a minute?

13:30.344 --> 13:32.244
Sure, come on up.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.219
How can you defend
Roland Turner?

13:43.257 --> 13:44.281
l'm not.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.313
Did you see this tape?

13:45.359 --> 13:46.553
l saw part of it.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.527
Well, did you see the part
where he questions

13:48.562 --> 13:50.393
whether the Jews faked their
deaths in Auschwitz

13:50.430 --> 13:52.796
so the U.N. would vote to create
the state of lsrael?

13:52.833 --> 13:53.857
He said that?

13:53.901 --> 13:55.368
Yeah, he said that.

13:55.402 --> 13:58.997
Now you understand what kind
of man we're dealing with.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.631
Still, he apologized
for that speech.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.005
Apologized to whom?

14:02.042 --> 14:04.602
The six million Jews
who died in the Holocaust?

14:04.645 --> 14:06.636
Please, the only reason
he said anything

14:06.680 --> 14:08.978
was because ABC News got
ahold of this tape.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.984
Look, l agree with you.

14:12.019 --> 14:15.887
Turner's obviously a racist, and
he's probably an anti-Semite...

14:15.923 --> 14:17.481
Probably an anti-Semite?

14:17.524 --> 14:19.583
Listen, the Student Senate's
gonna reconvene

14:19.626 --> 14:20.593
at 2:00 tomorrow.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.754
My sources tell me they're
gonna vote ten to five

14:22.796 --> 14:24.923
in support of the Black
Student Union on this one.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.523
How are you going to vote?

14:26.566 --> 14:28.329
l'll probably abstain.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.097
l don't believe you.

14:30.137 --> 14:32.628
Hey, the other side's
got the vote on this one.

14:32.673 --> 14:34.766
They don't care what l think.
lt's a done deal.

14:34.808 --> 14:36.469
This is a backroom deal.

14:36.510 --> 14:39.274
And what's that
supposed to mean?

14:39.313 --> 14:41.543
lt means l won't be surprised
when Janice Williams

14:41.581 --> 14:44.277
and Alex Diaz drop their
challenge to your presidency.

14:44.318 --> 14:47.219
l think you know me
a little better than that.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.653
That's okay,
Brandon.

14:48.689 --> 14:51.351
You're just a political animal
like the rest of them.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.858
Whoa, wait a second.

14:52.893 --> 14:55.157
You come over to my house
at 1 1 :00 at night

14:55.195 --> 14:58.221
to lobby me to vote your way,
and l'm a political animal?

14:58.265 --> 15:00.699
Shame on you.

15:17.718 --> 15:20.585
Brandon Walsh, up early
and working hard.

15:20.620 --> 15:21.951
Hey, D'Shawn,
long time no see.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.388
How's the team looking
this year, bud?

15:23.423 --> 15:24.981
First game's down in
Long Beach this Friday

15:25.092 --> 15:26.821
if you want to
come check it out.

15:26.860 --> 15:29.624
l'm supposed to go to a surprise
party this Friday,

15:29.663 --> 15:31.995
unless, of course, we have to
call out the National Guard

15:32.032 --> 15:33.226
to protect Mr. Turner.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.234
The talk was that was
going to be canceled.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.498
Well, the Senate
votes on it today,

15:37.537 --> 15:40.734
but my prediction is
he's gonna be there.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.765
You're not too thrilled
about that, huh?

15:42.809 --> 15:44.140
Frankly, no.

15:44.177 --> 15:47.203
Janice Williams keeps assuring
me that his real message

15:47.247 --> 15:49.579
is about self reliance
and self discipline,

15:49.616 --> 15:51.015
but l don't know.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.415
What do you think?

15:52.452 --> 15:54.818
l think Roland Turner is
a promoter, Brandon.

15:54.855 --> 15:56.880
And what are they
paying him-- 10,000 bucks?

15:56.923 --> 15:57.912
Something like that.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.425
Yeah, well, l get
suspicious of anyone

15:59.459 --> 16:01.518
who tells poor people what
they want to hear

16:01.561 --> 16:03.153
at 10,000 a pop.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.289
Don't let yourself
get dragged in it.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.664
lt'll just make you crazy.

16:07.701 --> 16:09.259
Yeah, you're right.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.293
Thanks, man.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.771
Have a good season, huh?

16:12.806 --> 16:13.898
Yeah, you, too.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.430
Thanks.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.977
Good morning.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.315
Hi.

16:26.353 --> 16:29.652
l thought you said you had an
important exam this morning.

16:29.689 --> 16:30.656
l did.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.681
l just wanted to see
how last night went.

16:32.726 --> 16:34.216
Oh, it went.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.092
Dylan slept. So did l.

16:36.129 --> 16:37.858
l hope you did.

16:37.898 --> 16:41.095
l'm not much
of a sleeper anymore.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.602
Oh, Valerie.

16:43.637 --> 16:45.002
l know.

16:45.072 --> 16:47.404
l'm too stressed out.

16:47.441 --> 16:48.999
l need to, uh, practice

16:49.076 --> 16:51.442
my breathing and
get myself centered.

16:51.478 --> 16:55.847
But first, um... l really
need to talk to Dylan.

16:55.882 --> 16:57.907
Oh, l wish
you could, too, dear,

16:57.951 --> 17:01.216
but right now, he just...

17:01.254 --> 17:04.155
He feels too ashamed
to see anybody.

17:04.191 --> 17:07.592
But there's nothing
to be ashamed of.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.652
l mean, things got
out of control.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.323
lt could happen to anybody.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.455
l know, l've seen it.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.730
Just give it time, Valerie, hmm?

17:15.769 --> 17:16.963
Time and love.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.972
l just wish there was
something l could do.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.270
Well, there is.
lf you wouldn't mind

17:22.309 --> 17:24.334
dropping by his house and
picking up a few

17:24.377 --> 17:28.176
personal things-- you know, like
his bathrobe and a toothbrush.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.375
Yeah, no problem.

17:29.416 --> 17:30.383
But first

17:30.417 --> 17:31.748
you get yourself to school

17:31.785 --> 17:33.218
and pass that test of yours.

17:33.253 --> 17:36.984
Okay, but before l go,

17:37.057 --> 17:39.457
uh, there's something
that l need.

17:39.493 --> 17:41.427
What's that, dear?

17:41.461 --> 17:43.122
The house keys.

17:52.372 --> 17:55.364
Now everything's
going to be fine,

17:55.408 --> 17:57.672
and don't worry about Charles.

17:57.711 --> 17:59.542
He's got a great eye.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.571
He just gets a little
skittish under pressure.

18:02.616 --> 18:05.779
Since l'm skittish by nature,
we should get along just fine.

18:05.819 --> 18:07.719
You seem very calm to me.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.689
Exteriors can be
deceiving.

18:10.724 --> 18:12.885
lsn't that what posing's
all about?

18:12.926 --> 18:16.089
No more. She's perfect.

18:16.129 --> 18:18.393
Your whole life is
about to change.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.296
You know that, don't you?

18:20.333 --> 18:23.700
From one photo session?
l don't think so.

18:23.737 --> 18:25.705
Hi, we found you.

18:25.739 --> 18:27.104
Hey, it's our little
glamour queen.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.107
Shh!

18:28.141 --> 18:30.735
Nora Troussant,
these are my friends--

18:30.777 --> 18:31.835
Steve Sanders
and Donna Martin.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.175
-lt's a pleasure.
-Hi.

18:33.213 --> 18:35.078
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-Hi.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.514
l love what you're wearing.

18:36.550 --> 18:38.245
Yeah, it's cute, huh?

18:38.285 --> 18:40.617
l wanted to go with white
to play up her blondness.

18:40.654 --> 18:42.554
Oh, she's a blonde,
all right.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.489
Steve, don't you have
somewhere to go?

18:44.524 --> 18:46.515
No, not unless you want me to
renegotiate your contract.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.152
Don't mind him.

18:48.195 --> 18:49.753
So where are they
doing your spread?

18:49.796 --> 18:51.195
On the main quad.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.755
Oh, l don't think so.

18:52.799 --> 18:53.823
Why not?

18:53.867 --> 18:56.495
Have you seen the
main quad today?

18:56.536 --> 18:58.367
Stop Roland Turner

18:58.405 --> 19:01.306
from spreading his message
of hate.

19:01.341 --> 19:05.175
Sign the petition, let the
Senate know how you feel.

19:05.212 --> 19:09.512
Stop Roland Turner from
spreading his message of hate.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.949
Sign the petition,
let the Senate know how...

19:11.985 --> 19:13.509
Thank you.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.248
David, just the person
l want to see--

19:15.288 --> 19:17.085
l have something
for you to sign.

19:17.123 --> 19:18.715
Yeah, well don't take
this personal,

19:18.758 --> 19:20.350
but l'm not really
into politics, Andrea.

19:20.393 --> 19:21.417
This isn't about politics.

19:21.461 --> 19:22.928
You're Jewish, aren't you?

19:22.963 --> 19:24.555
Yeah, sure, l'm Jewish.

19:24.598 --> 19:26.498
Then how can you tolerate
anti-Semitism?

19:26.533 --> 19:29.627
Because being Jewish has never
really been a problem for me.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.694
David, of course
it hasn't been.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.831
You grew up in Beverly Hills.

19:33.873 --> 19:36.171
No, Andrea, maybe it's

19:36.209 --> 19:38.803
because l never made such
a big deal about it.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.244
Fine. Don't sign it.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.247
Andrea...

19:41.281 --> 19:42.248
No, you know what?

19:42.282 --> 19:44.716
There is an old parable
about a man

19:44.751 --> 19:46.810
who said nothing when they
went and arrested people

19:46.853 --> 19:48.980
from another city because
he didn't know who they were.

19:49.055 --> 19:50.613
And he didn't say
anything when they went

19:50.657 --> 19:52.147
to take his neighbors
away because he figured

19:52.192 --> 19:53.819
''Hey, it has nothing
to do with me.''

19:53.860 --> 19:56.226
And finally when they came
to his house,

19:56.263 --> 19:59.528
he wondered why there was no one
left to stand up for him.

20:01.134 --> 20:02.624
Sign the petition.

20:02.669 --> 20:05.001
Let the Senate know
how you feel.

20:05.105 --> 20:09.838
Stop Roland Turner from
spreading his message of hate.

20:09.876 --> 20:10.900
Sign the petition.

20:10.944 --> 20:13.708
Let the Senate know
how you feel.

20:13.747 --> 20:17.945
Stop Roland Turner from
spreading his message of hate.

20:17.984 --> 20:20.316
Sign the petition...

20:58.425 --> 21:00.359
Oh... Uh, Dylan around?

21:00.393 --> 21:01.758
No, he's not.

21:01.795 --> 21:02.921
Can l help you?

21:02.962 --> 21:04.759
You know where l can get
in touch with him?

21:04.798 --> 21:07.392
And who are you?

21:07.434 --> 21:09.959
l'm just an old surfing buddy
in from San Diego

21:10.003 --> 21:11.163
for a couple of days.

21:11.204 --> 21:12.796
So, you know when he'll be back?

21:12.839 --> 21:14.898
Not for awhile.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.341
Oh. So, how's he doing?

21:17.377 --> 21:19.777
He was a pretty wild guy
back when l knew him.

21:19.813 --> 21:21.474
l hope he's calmed down
a little bit.

21:23.249 --> 21:24.944
ls he all right?

21:24.984 --> 21:28.010
No, not really.

21:28.088 --> 21:30.648
l'm sorry to hear that.

21:30.690 --> 21:33.989
Say, you don't know how l can
get in touch with him, do you?

21:36.129 --> 21:38.393
Yeah, sure, come on in.

21:38.431 --> 21:39.955
All right.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.459
We've collected
over 1 ,500 signatures

21:43.503 --> 21:44.993
in the last six hours.

21:45.038 --> 21:47.165
Which'll be presented to
the council this afternoon.

21:47.207 --> 21:48.674
See, they don't want
a black man

21:48.708 --> 21:50.972
to tell 'em like it is,
'cause that scares them.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.705
No, it's your ignorance
that scares me.

21:52.746 --> 21:54.407
-Who you calling
ignorant, bitch? -Hey, look...

21:54.447 --> 21:56.938
They're turning this school
into a three-ring media circus.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.042
We'll get through
this, Brandon.

21:59.119 --> 22:01.053
Let me know how
the vote goes.

22:01.121 --> 22:02.520
-Yeah, l will.
-Okay?

22:02.555 --> 22:04.079
Thanks, Dean.

22:05.458 --> 22:08.086
Can't control your friends
anymore, huh, Brandon?

22:08.128 --> 22:09.425
That's not a good sign.

22:09.462 --> 22:10.429
Go away, Alex.

22:10.463 --> 22:11.430
Well, you know,

22:11.464 --> 22:13.125
if you'd have taken
the vote yesterday,

22:13.166 --> 22:15.134
like a real
president would've,

22:15.168 --> 22:17.568
none of this would
have happened.

22:24.711 --> 22:26.269
-Hey, Kel.
-Hi.

22:26.312 --> 22:28.007
You look terrific.
ls this what you're wearing

22:28.081 --> 22:29.571
-in the photo shoot?
-l don't think

22:29.616 --> 22:32.016
there's gonna be a photo shoot
unless the Maccabee Center

22:32.118 --> 22:33.813
decides to move their
little demonstration.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.115
Fat chance--
Andrea and her friends

22:35.155 --> 22:36.782
are so bent out
of shape about this,

22:36.823 --> 22:37.915
there's no reasoning
with them.

22:37.957 --> 22:39.322
Kelly,

22:39.359 --> 22:40.656
it's over.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.752
Charles won't work
under these conditions.

22:42.796 --> 22:44.024
Can't we go
somewhere else?

22:44.130 --> 22:47.327
Charles is too upset,
and frankly, so am l.

22:47.367 --> 22:48.994
l'm sorry, Kel.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.629
Nora, this is my
boyfriend, Brandon Walsh.

22:51.671 --> 22:53.662
This is Nora-- she's
with the magazine.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.640
She's put a lot
of effort into this.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.040
You know...

22:57.110 --> 23:01.012
l've worked in Milan, Paris,

23:01.047 --> 23:02.878
all over the world

23:02.916 --> 23:05.714
because of
what l can do,

23:05.752 --> 23:08.812
because of who l am inside.

23:08.855 --> 23:11.790
And it's only here,

23:11.825 --> 23:14.385
in the land of the free,

23:14.427 --> 23:17.624
that l'm constantly reminded

23:17.664 --> 23:22.363
that it is all about
the color of my skin.

23:28.741 --> 23:31.266
All right, now, before
this meeting gets started,

23:31.311 --> 23:33.438
there are a few things
l'd like to say.

23:42.188 --> 23:44.452
We have to evacuate the Union,
immediately.

23:44.491 --> 23:46.686
Somebody just called in
a bomb threat.

24:01.341 --> 24:03.309
The bomb squad thinks
the call could've come

24:03.343 --> 24:05.174
from a splinter group
from the JDL,

24:05.211 --> 24:06.974
or possibly the Ku Klux Klan.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.173
But who knows?

24:09.215 --> 24:11.183
l think he's holding up.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.651
Would you like
to speak to him?

24:13.686 --> 24:15.051
Brandon.

24:16.623 --> 24:18.989
Hi, Chancellor.

24:19.058 --> 24:20.218
Yeah.

24:20.260 --> 24:22.820
Well, now that the senate
voted to let Turner come,

24:22.862 --> 24:25.353
l think things are only
gonna get worse.

24:26.599 --> 24:28.794
Yeah, l'll tell him.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.700
Thanks. l'll try.

24:30.737 --> 24:32.864
Well, here's a brainstorm--
the chancellor thinks

24:32.906 --> 24:34.999
we should beef up security
on Friday night.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.372
l'm already
working on it.

24:36.409 --> 24:39.207
And l'm already working
on my resignation speech.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.507
l hope you're kidding.

24:40.547 --> 24:41.844
Half kidding.

24:41.881 --> 24:43.405
l don't want
to be remembered

24:43.449 --> 24:45.781
as the guy who presided
over the Civil War.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.911
Do you think it
could come to that?

24:47.954 --> 24:49.319
lt's pretty bleak, sir.

24:49.355 --> 24:50.822
Janice Williams
and Noah Levy

24:50.857 --> 24:53.155
got into a shouting
match after the vote.

24:53.192 --> 24:55.683
Both sides are grandstanding
for the press.

24:55.728 --> 24:57.457
lt's totally depressing.

24:57.497 --> 24:59.294
For me, too.

25:00.533 --> 25:02.398
You don't know much
about my background,

25:02.435 --> 25:05.097
but l was one of the first
black students admitted

25:05.138 --> 25:06.867
to the University
of Georgia.

25:06.906 --> 25:09.204
And l remember the threats
and the cat calls

25:09.242 --> 25:11.267
when we tried to desegregate
the lunch counters

25:11.311 --> 25:12.608
and register new voters.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.169
Were you one of
the Freedom Riders?

25:14.213 --> 25:16.443
And l was there at the
Reflecting Pool in Washington

25:16.482 --> 25:18.882
when Martin Luther King
spoke about his dream.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.510
And every step of the way,

25:20.553 --> 25:22.714
at every battle
that needed to be fought,

25:22.755 --> 25:25.315
Jewish people were
right there with us.

25:25.358 --> 25:28.850
To have it all unravel
after only one generation

25:28.895 --> 25:31.227
is a very sobering thought.

25:35.368 --> 25:39.464
Boom box, the boom box to give
it to you, boom box...

25:39.505 --> 25:42.474
How does he sound
at a lower volume?

25:42.508 --> 25:43.668
ls that a hint?

25:43.710 --> 25:45.507
Yeah.

25:49.415 --> 25:51.542
Hi, guys. Sorry l'm late.

25:51.584 --> 25:53.711
Hi. What'd they say?

25:53.753 --> 25:55.744
lt was crazy--
when the bomb threat happened,

25:55.788 --> 25:58.222
l thought the photographer was
gonna have a nervous breakdown.

25:58.257 --> 25:59.952
-Did they reschedule?
-Yeah,

25:59.993 --> 26:01.927
but now they want to change
the whole concept.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.122
They don't want to do the shoot
on campus anymore.

26:04.163 --> 26:05.960
Well, who can blame them?

26:05.999 --> 26:08.900
And they're thinking
of putting me on the cover.

26:10.203 --> 26:11.500
That's great!

26:11.537 --> 26:14.904
Thanks. But there's one
slight problem.

26:14.941 --> 26:17.876
They rescheduled the shoot
for Friday night.

26:19.212 --> 26:22.807
Mm. So you can't come
to Ray's surprise party.

26:22.849 --> 26:23.816
Sorry.

26:23.850 --> 26:24.817
That's okay.

26:24.851 --> 26:26.785
Steve's not coming, either.

26:26.819 --> 26:27.877
Why not?

26:27.920 --> 26:29.410
Out of loyalty
to Griffin.

26:29.455 --> 26:33.915
''Sorry, us KEG men gotta
stick together, Donna.''

26:33.960 --> 26:34.984
What a creep.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.561
Yeah. Andrea's
obviously

26:36.596 --> 26:39.759
busy, and if you're out,
that means Brandon's out,

26:39.799 --> 26:42.563
and poor Dylan, he's...
really out of it, so...

26:42.602 --> 26:44.126
Yeah. l tried to call him today.

26:44.170 --> 26:45.728
lris said he was
still pretty low.

26:45.772 --> 26:48.263
Do you think l should
invite Valerie?

26:48.307 --> 26:50.605
Not unless you want her to make
a move on your boyfriend.

26:50.643 --> 26:53.476
You know, Ray doesn't really
seem like the party animal type.

26:53.513 --> 26:56.107
Why don't we just make it a
small dinner party for the

26:56.149 --> 26:57.480
-four of us?
-Okay.

26:57.517 --> 26:59.644
But wait,
you're still gonna go

26:59.686 --> 27:01.244
pick out his present
with me, right?

27:01.287 --> 27:03.482
Sure. Just let me call Brandon
and see how he's holding up.

27:03.523 --> 27:05.218
No, no. Come on, just
do it from the car,

27:05.258 --> 27:06.657
'cause the store
closes at 6:00, okay?

27:06.693 --> 27:08.820
Anything for you, bubbie.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.488
Ciao.

27:10.530 --> 27:11.588
See ya.

27:15.168 --> 27:16.499
What's wrong?

27:17.670 --> 27:20.764
Uh... it's nothing, really.

27:22.642 --> 27:23.904
lt's just...

27:26.646 --> 27:29.444
What do you think
of me being Jewish?

27:29.482 --> 27:31.473
l don't know.

27:31.517 --> 27:35.510
l don't really think of
you as being Jewish.

27:35.555 --> 27:38.251
l don't really think of you
as being anything at all.

27:38.291 --> 27:40.225
You're just David.

27:40.259 --> 27:42.989
So it doesn't really
make a difference to you?

27:43.096 --> 27:45.496
Does it make a
difference to you?

27:47.667 --> 27:50.329
l don't know.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.200
But Grandma,
nobody at the Maccabee Center

27:52.238 --> 27:54.331
said anything to imply
that they would tolerate

27:54.373 --> 27:57.706
a loony who would go
and call in a bomb scare.

27:57.744 --> 28:00.941
l honestly don't think that's
how the media's gonna play it.

28:00.980 --> 28:03.380
Look, l got to go--
l want to feed the baby,

28:03.416 --> 28:06.180
watch the news and spend at
least 15 seconds with my husband

28:06.219 --> 28:08.779
before l go back to the Maccabee
Center for the board meeting.

28:08.821 --> 28:10.311
Okay. l know--
l love you, too.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.323
Bye-bye.

28:13.025 --> 28:15.653
l wish the phone would stop
ringing already.

28:16.963 --> 28:18.430
What are you smiling about?

28:18.464 --> 28:19.431
Andrea,

28:19.465 --> 28:20.762
l'm your husband, l love you,

28:20.800 --> 28:22.961
but you got to admit,
you thrive on this stuff.

28:23.002 --> 28:24.162
What stuff?

28:24.203 --> 28:25.636
The controversy,
the politics.

28:25.671 --> 28:27.366
Being in the limelight.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.374
Jesse, don't cheapen
what this is about, okay?

28:29.408 --> 28:31.774
lt's not about me--
it is about Roland Turner

28:31.811 --> 28:33.369
and his warped sense of history.

28:33.412 --> 28:35.812
Okay, okay.

28:35.848 --> 28:37.873
ln that case--

28:37.917 --> 28:39.509
yeah--

28:39.552 --> 28:41.884
sorry l said anything.

28:41.921 --> 28:44.617
l want to hear what it is you
have to say.

28:44.657 --> 28:46.682
l just don't know
what it is you're saying.

28:46.726 --> 28:48.694
Well, in my opinion,

28:48.728 --> 28:50.593
there's definitely
a clear difference

28:50.630 --> 28:54.225
between free speech
and hate speech, but...

28:54.267 --> 28:56.997
people are allowed
to have other opinions, Andrea.

28:57.103 --> 28:58.730
But l didn't say they weren't.

28:58.771 --> 29:00.398
Then tell that to Brandon.

29:00.439 --> 29:03.067
Excuse me, Brandon is
a whole different story.

29:03.109 --> 29:05.509
He abstained because he
didn't want to offend anybody,

29:05.545 --> 29:08.105
and in the process
he alienated everybody.

29:08.147 --> 29:09.944
Okay, l think
the news is starting.

29:10.049 --> 29:11.141
Jesse,

29:11.184 --> 29:12.583
please talk to me.

29:14.554 --> 29:16.715
Well, what am l supposed to say?

29:16.756 --> 29:18.849
You're dynamic...

29:18.891 --> 29:20.449
y-you're smart,

29:20.493 --> 29:23.951
you're beautiful,
you're passionate...

29:23.996 --> 29:25.725
you're a good mom.

29:27.400 --> 29:30.096
But you're not a very
tolerant person, Andrea.

29:30.136 --> 29:32.627
You're just not.

29:37.743 --> 29:39.608
Today's student vote
is a clear indication

29:39.645 --> 29:41.772
of their indifference
to the rise of anti-Semitism

29:41.814 --> 29:44.214
in this country,
and we will not stand by

29:44.250 --> 29:45.808
while our lives
are being threatened.

29:45.852 --> 29:47.513
Furthermore, Roland Turner's
appearance at C.U.

29:47.553 --> 29:49.885
serves no purpose
but to promote fear and hatred

29:49.922 --> 29:52.550
and to exacerbate the existing
racial tensions on our campus.

29:52.592 --> 29:54.992
l can't watch any more of this.

29:55.061 --> 29:56.528
Brandon...

29:58.865 --> 30:00.696
Hey, hey, hey, l know you're
caught in the middle of this,

30:00.733 --> 30:02.257
but it really wasn't
as bad as you think.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.496
You're right, Dad. They could've
detonated the building.

30:04.537 --> 30:05.731
Now, that would've
been embarrassing.

30:05.771 --> 30:06.760
Brandon.

30:06.806 --> 30:07.932
l'm serious, Dad.

30:07.974 --> 30:09.601
You try to come up
with a compromise

30:09.642 --> 30:11.872
that everyone can live with,
and then a friend of yours

30:11.911 --> 30:13.936
goes on TV and makes you
look like a fool.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.346
You're not a fool,
and you're not a failure.

30:16.382 --> 30:17.974
But you are a white male

30:18.017 --> 30:19.814
in a world
where the power structure's

30:19.852 --> 30:22.343
becoming less male
and less white every day.

30:22.388 --> 30:24.015
The times they are a-changin'.

30:24.123 --> 30:26.956
They always do.

30:37.403 --> 30:40.395
l thought you were
supposed to be dead.

30:43.242 --> 30:44.266
Go on!

30:45.378 --> 30:47.005
You're a hero, McKay!

30:47.046 --> 30:48.513
McKay, McKay...

30:48.547 --> 30:50.037
What do you want?

30:50.116 --> 30:53.517
You look like you
could use a taste.

30:53.552 --> 30:57.113
Or are they shooting you up with
that good pharmaceutical stuff?

31:06.232 --> 31:07.529
You know...

31:07.566 --> 31:09.761
if l was to yank
out this l.V.,

31:09.802 --> 31:11.770
you'd be in
pretty sad shape.

31:11.804 --> 31:14.466
There's a purpose
to life, Dylan...

31:14.507 --> 31:15.974
trust me.

31:21.047 --> 31:23.038
Trust yourself.

31:24.417 --> 31:26.385
What do you want?

31:26.419 --> 31:28.717
When the cops come
to arrest you,

31:28.754 --> 31:32.485
and they will
arrest you...

31:32.525 --> 31:34.550
forget you ever knew me.

31:34.593 --> 31:36.527
You hear?

31:36.562 --> 31:38.029
Dylan?

31:38.097 --> 31:40.565
Now you get better,
you hear? Huh?

31:40.599 --> 31:42.590
Everybody misses you.

31:45.071 --> 31:47.767
Aren't you going to
introduce me to your friend?

31:47.807 --> 31:49.434
He was just leaving.

31:49.475 --> 31:51.500
l'll catch you later, buddy.

31:51.544 --> 31:53.444
l don't think so.

31:58.384 --> 32:00.614
You all right?

32:00.653 --> 32:02.712
Yeah, l'm all right.

32:09.161 --> 32:10.958
Hey, chief.

32:10.997 --> 32:12.294
Hey.

32:12.331 --> 32:13.298
You're up early.

32:13.332 --> 32:14.299
Yeah, so are you.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.233
Well, my daughter
gets up at 5:00 a.m.

32:16.268 --> 32:17.963
l don't have much choice
in the matter.

32:18.004 --> 32:19.471
-Ah.
-What about you?

32:19.505 --> 32:22.474
l like to get a workout in
before the day gets too hectic.

32:22.508 --> 32:23.873
l guess we've, uh,

32:23.909 --> 32:25.467
lost touch with each
other's routines, huh?

32:25.511 --> 32:26.478
Yeah.

32:26.512 --> 32:29.310
Saw you on TV
last night.

32:29.348 --> 32:33.444
Yeah. There are a few things
l'd like to take back.

32:33.486 --> 32:35.010
Something you believe
in your heart,

32:35.054 --> 32:37.249
you never have to
apologize for that.

32:37.289 --> 32:39.416
l know, but l, uh...

32:39.458 --> 32:42.018
l'd like to apologize
to you, Brandon.

32:42.094 --> 32:45.427
l mean, l... as a friend.

32:45.464 --> 32:49.161
Well, as a friend and
longtime political ally,

32:49.201 --> 32:50.691
l accept.

32:52.772 --> 32:54.740
So, where you off to?

32:54.774 --> 32:57.538
Ah, a board meeting
at the Maccabee Center.

32:57.576 --> 32:59.407
-You're on the board now?
-l'm in

32:59.445 --> 33:01.242
over my head, is what l am.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.338
Why?

33:03.382 --> 33:04.974
You want to walk?

33:05.051 --> 33:07.144
Sure.

33:07.186 --> 33:09.279
Yeah, so l told Noah Levy,

33:09.321 --> 33:11.983
l said, ''Look, if we walk
into that auditorium

33:12.058 --> 33:14.458
''and disrupt Turner in
the middle of his speech,

33:14.493 --> 33:15.983
we're gonna lose any
sympathy we have.''

33:16.062 --> 33:17.927
Yeah. You gotta keep
your people out of there,

33:17.963 --> 33:19.624
otherwise all hell
is going to break loose.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.963
l know.

33:22.001 --> 33:24.936
How would you feel about you
and Janice Williams sitting down

33:24.970 --> 33:26.733
one-on-one talking
about security?

33:26.772 --> 33:29.002
Maybe you guys could find some
kind of common denominator.

33:29.075 --> 33:30.565
l don't think she'd do that.

33:30.609 --> 33:34.101
She's the one that
suggested it.

33:34.146 --> 33:35.272
Okay. Let's do it.

33:35.314 --> 33:38.806
Good. How about
1 1 :00, my office?

33:56.635 --> 34:00.196
Join the protest tonight
against Roland Turner.

34:00.239 --> 34:04.266
Don't let hate be the only
voice that's heard,

34:04.310 --> 34:05.607
Join the protest...

34:05.644 --> 34:07.976
l asked them to let us
paint over the swastikas.

34:08.013 --> 34:09.172
They won't listen to me.

34:09.215 --> 34:10.648
Well, they'll
listen to me.

34:10.683 --> 34:12.708
This is University
property.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.411
We can't let buildings
be defaced like this.

34:14.453 --> 34:16.478
They promised me they'll remove
them themselves in the morning.

34:16.522 --> 34:18.513
They really just feel it's
important to keep it

34:18.556 --> 34:19.989
just like this until
after Turner speaks.

34:20.025 --> 34:22.425
l'm sorry. That's
completely unacceptable.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.292
They really feel strongly
about this, Dean.

34:24.330 --> 34:25.558
l wish you'd reconsider.

34:25.598 --> 34:28.567
l don't understand
their thinking at all.

34:28.601 --> 34:31.627
The swastika is a symbol
of Nazi persecution.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.797
What kind of a statement are
they trying to make?

34:33.839 --> 34:35.830
That it could happen again.

34:35.875 --> 34:38.206
Join the protest tonight

34:38.244 --> 34:39.505
against Roland Turner.

34:39.545 --> 34:42.878
Don't let hate be
the only voice that's heard.

34:42.915 --> 34:47.409
Join the protest tonight
against Roland Turner.

34:47.453 --> 34:50.114
Don't let hate be the
only voice that's heard.

34:50.156 --> 34:54.024
Join the protest tonight
against Roland Turner.

34:54.059 --> 34:55.889
Don't let hate
be the only...

34:55.928 --> 35:00.194
Andrea, l just wanted to give
you a copy of the statement

35:00.232 --> 35:01.665
the B.S.U. released
deploring anyone...

35:01.700 --> 35:03.861
Look, l, l can't deal
with you right now, okay?

35:03.903 --> 35:05.894
Look, l just don't
want you to blame us

35:05.938 --> 35:07.462
for everything that's
been happening.

35:07.506 --> 35:08.632
Of course, l blame you.

35:08.674 --> 35:10.699
l mean, you're the ones
who invited Turner here.

35:10.743 --> 35:12.233
You're the ones who
created an atmosphere

35:12.278 --> 35:13.905
of hate on this campus.
lt wasn't us.

35:13.946 --> 35:17.712
Andrea, you're basing your
entire opinion of Dr. Turner

35:17.750 --> 35:20.719
on one bootlegged videotape
that is not a true reflection

35:20.753 --> 35:22.618
of what he or his
organization is all about.

35:22.655 --> 35:23.986
Oh, really?

35:24.023 --> 35:26.583
Then maybe your Dr. Turner
would like to see my videotape,

35:26.625 --> 35:27.990
the one where my
grandmother describes

35:28.093 --> 35:29.924
what it was like
to be in Buchenwald.

35:29.962 --> 35:31.793
l'm sure that would
go over great.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.593
...Roland Turner.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.726
Don't let hate be
the only voice that's heard.

35:36.769 --> 35:37.827
Great.

35:37.870 --> 35:40.771
She's not even a doctor.

35:40.806 --> 35:43.536
l'm not telling her anything.

35:43.576 --> 35:46.704
lf l told her my dreams were
about being in a tunnel

35:46.745 --> 35:50.442
with the devil until my
dead father stepped out of

35:50.482 --> 35:53.007
the white light and saved me,
she'd have me committed.

35:53.085 --> 35:54.347
No, she wouldn't.

35:54.386 --> 35:55.478
To me, dreams

35:55.521 --> 35:57.648
are the window to the soul,

35:57.690 --> 36:00.158
and you don't have to reveal
anything you don't want to.

36:00.192 --> 36:03.184
No, but l do have
to get committed.

36:03.229 --> 36:05.288
l mean, eventually
the court's going to make me

36:05.331 --> 36:07.094
go to rehab somewhere.

36:07.132 --> 36:09.600
Well, the key word is
''committed.''

36:09.635 --> 36:11.500
lf your heart's not into it...

36:11.537 --> 36:12.970
l'm into it, l just...

36:13.005 --> 36:16.839
Look, l went to AA before
in high school.

36:16.875 --> 36:19.503
And l'm not knocking it,
l just don't...

36:19.545 --> 36:21.410
l think this time
l need something

36:21.447 --> 36:23.142
a little unconventional.

36:23.182 --> 36:26.379
Okay.

36:26.418 --> 36:28.249
We'll find you something.

36:28.287 --> 36:30.755
Well, we've gotta find something
cheap. l can't afford to...

36:30.789 --> 36:32.780
Oh, Dylan, don't worry
about the money.

36:32.825 --> 36:35.555
l used to say that to
your father every day.

36:35.594 --> 36:38.495
Well, you didn't say that to my
answering machine this summer.

36:38.530 --> 36:43.160
Well, hell, even a spiritualist
can have a bad day.

36:52.044 --> 36:53.841
Hey, Donna, how's it going?

36:53.879 --> 36:55.107
Mmm, great.

36:55.147 --> 36:57.012
You know, chicken Parmesan
is so easy to make.

36:57.082 --> 36:58.140
You just...

36:58.183 --> 36:59.616
Put Parmesan cheese
on chicken, right?

36:59.652 --> 37:00.880
Yeah, you're right.

37:00.919 --> 37:02.853
And look, l've got a salad,
fresh cantaloupe,

37:02.888 --> 37:04.378
and a birthday cake, of course.

37:04.423 --> 37:06.618
You better tell her.

37:07.893 --> 37:10.225
Donna, l... l can't stay.

37:10.262 --> 37:11.286
What?

37:11.330 --> 37:12.490
He feels guilty

37:12.531 --> 37:14.192
for not going to the
demonstration tonight.

37:14.233 --> 37:17.225
l don't fast on Yom Kippur.
l don't eat Matzoh on Passover.

37:17.269 --> 37:18.531
l've got to do something.

37:18.570 --> 37:21.232
But Ray's going to be here
in 20 minutes.

37:21.273 --> 37:22.968
Donna, l'm sorry.

37:23.008 --> 37:24.999
l promise, l'll-l'll
make it up to you.

37:29.114 --> 37:32.481
Great, he had to go find
religion tonight, huh?

37:32.518 --> 37:33.712
l won't be late, okay?

37:33.752 --> 37:36.516
Oh, this is for Ray.

37:37.790 --> 37:39.189
See ya.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.001
Amen.

37:52.071 --> 37:53.003
-Amen.
-Amen.

37:53.072 --> 37:55.233
lsn't it prophetic
how the B.S.U.

37:55.274 --> 37:57.469
invited Turner to speak
on the Sabbath.

37:57.509 --> 37:58.976
Let's eat.

37:59.011 --> 38:01.536
My husband is so
supportive of me, Grandma.

38:01.580 --> 38:03.810
He is supportive,
but there are limits.

38:03.849 --> 38:05.714
Rose, do you want a leg,
or white meat?

38:05.751 --> 38:06.945
A leg will be fine.

38:07.052 --> 38:09.111
Grandma, can l talk
to you alone for a minute?

38:09.154 --> 38:10.883
Of course.

38:15.928 --> 38:19.420
Grandma, l know how concerned
you must be about tonight,

38:19.465 --> 38:22.093
but l promise, l'm not gonna
cross any police barricades

38:22.134 --> 38:24.102
and l'm gonna let Noah
do all the interviews.

38:24.136 --> 38:25.603
That's good to know.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.832
l know how distressing
this must be for you.

38:27.873 --> 38:28.840
Do you?

38:28.874 --> 38:29.841
Of course l do.

38:29.875 --> 38:32.105
All the horrible memories
it must bring back,

38:32.144 --> 38:34.612
and that here in America,
in the 1990's,

38:34.646 --> 38:37.240
anti-Semitism and ignorance
still exists must just be...

38:37.282 --> 38:38.249
Andrea,

38:38.283 --> 38:42.083
there will always be
ignorance and swastikas

38:42.121 --> 38:44.316
and hate crimes and worse,

38:44.356 --> 38:46.290
but for me, tonight,

38:46.325 --> 38:49.192
what is distressing is to hear
that you've been fighting

38:49.228 --> 38:50.627
with your friends

38:50.662 --> 38:52.789
and have distanced
from your husband.

38:52.831 --> 38:54.492
But that's because
they don't understand

38:54.533 --> 38:56.797
how dangerous a man
like Turner is.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.803
That's why we have to speak out.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.395
We can't let ourselves
be intimidated.

39:00.439 --> 39:04.933
That's important, but there's
also a time to listen--

39:04.977 --> 39:06.911
a time to turn the other cheek.

39:06.945 --> 39:09.311
What are you suggesting, that l
join the welcoming committee?

39:09.348 --> 39:11.782
Hey, it's getting
awful lonely in here.

39:11.817 --> 39:12.875
Coming.

39:16.088 --> 39:18.556
Grandma, l-l want
to understand.

39:20.426 --> 39:23.486
What l have to say
may not make sense

39:23.529 --> 39:25.827
to a modern person
like yourself,

39:25.864 --> 39:30.301
but in the Talmud it is said
that if a man is an anti-Semite,

39:30.335 --> 39:34.328
he must be spurned, for he is
too consumed with hate

39:34.373 --> 39:35.738
to listen to reason.

39:35.774 --> 39:38.902
But if someone
like Dr. Turner

39:38.944 --> 39:42.607
is first a man who seeks
the good of his community,

39:42.648 --> 39:44.309
and then is anti-Semitic,

39:44.349 --> 39:49.651
we must reach out to him
for if given a chance,

39:49.688 --> 39:52.521
he will eventually see
the error of his ways.

39:52.558 --> 39:54.924
But Roland Turner isn't
that kind of man.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.518
Well, how do you know?

39:56.562 --> 40:01.465
lf l were you, l would not
stay outside and protest,

40:01.500 --> 40:05.231
but l would be inside that
auditorium to bear witness.

40:09.141 --> 40:10.005
Happy Birthday.

40:10.108 --> 40:12.872
Yeah, That's me--
older and wiser.

40:14.346 --> 40:16.712
What's wrong?

40:16.748 --> 40:20.013
Well, first l wanted to throw
this big surprise party,

40:20.052 --> 40:22.213
but everyone bailed,
and then Clare and David

40:22.254 --> 40:23.687
were supposed to
be here for dinner...

40:23.722 --> 40:25.747
Donna, l didn't come over
to see Clare and David.

40:25.791 --> 40:27.122
l don't even like
Clare and David.

40:27.159 --> 40:28.126
You don't?

40:28.160 --> 40:30.856
Once l get to know them,
maybe things will change,

40:30.896 --> 40:32.955
but you're the one
l care about,

40:32.998 --> 40:35.990
write songs about.

40:38.170 --> 40:41.469
Well, uh, speaking of songs,
just hold that thought, okay?

40:41.507 --> 40:43.031
Where are you going?

40:43.108 --> 40:44.439
To get your present.

40:44.476 --> 40:47.843
You couldn't just let my
birthday come and go, huh?

40:47.880 --> 40:50.280
Nope, couldn't do that.

40:54.353 --> 40:57.186
Donna, this is a Gibson ES335.

40:57.222 --> 40:59.622
lt's... it's like a classic.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.182
Yeah, well, the man at the store

41:01.226 --> 41:03.456
said Roy Orbison used
to play one just like it.

41:03.495 --> 41:05.463
This had to cost you a fortune.

41:05.497 --> 41:08.227
Well, you're worth it.

41:08.267 --> 41:09.962
Happy Birthday.

41:24.783 --> 41:26.250
Don't you think
there'll be trouble

41:26.285 --> 41:27.616
once Turner
starts speaking?

41:27.653 --> 41:30.019
Oh, l think we'll be able
to keep the situation

41:30.122 --> 41:31.555
under control here.

41:31.590 --> 41:33.319
The campus security is
out in force tonight,

41:33.358 --> 41:35.622
and the Maccabee Center promised
to conduct themselves

41:35.661 --> 41:37.526
with dignity and aplomb,
and as you can see,

41:37.563 --> 41:38.962
they are being true
to their word.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.430
But what if something
does happen?

41:40.465 --> 41:42.763
The only thing that's gonna
happen is this interview

41:42.801 --> 41:44.029
is gonna end, so, uh,

41:44.069 --> 41:46.401
why don't you go chase
a fire or something?

41:48.340 --> 41:49.807
Hey, is Turner here yet?

41:49.841 --> 41:51.331
Unfortunately, punctuality

41:51.376 --> 41:52.900
doesn't seem to be
his strong suit.

41:52.945 --> 41:54.879
Great, how's everyone
doing inside?

41:54.913 --> 41:55.880
Staying cool.

41:55.914 --> 41:58.405
Good. Glad to hear it.

41:58.450 --> 41:59.576
Thanks for everything,
Brandon.

41:59.618 --> 42:00.846
You got it.

42:00.886 --> 42:03.684
Next time if you plan on
doing something like this,

42:03.722 --> 42:05.349
maybe you should
invite Bill Cosby.

42:09.461 --> 42:11.156
Well, my friend Zuckerman

42:11.196 --> 42:13.790
certainly knows how to
pull out all the stops.

42:13.832 --> 42:15.993
You must be very proud
of your granddaughter.

42:16.101 --> 42:18.433
Oh, that l am.

42:18.470 --> 42:19.869
Pretty impressive, huh?

42:19.905 --> 42:22.430
Very impressive.

42:22.474 --> 42:24.237
Why don't you guys take
a candle and join the line?

42:24.276 --> 42:28.235
No, l think that we're going
to, uh, go inside.

42:28.280 --> 42:29.508
That is brilliant.

42:29.548 --> 42:31.015
They wouldn't do
anything to you

42:31.083 --> 42:32.209
with your grandmother in there.

42:32.250 --> 42:34.844
We'll see you later.

42:39.758 --> 42:40.986
Grandma Rose.

42:41.026 --> 42:42.152
Brandon.

42:42.194 --> 42:43.320
Hi.

42:43.362 --> 42:44.852
Rose Zuckerman, this
is Janice Williams.

42:44.896 --> 42:46.557
She's with the Black
Student Union.

42:46.598 --> 42:47.565
Hi.

42:47.599 --> 42:49.362
l saw you on the
news last night.

42:49.401 --> 42:51.494
You're very
well-spoken.

42:51.536 --> 42:52.594
Oh, thank you.

42:52.638 --> 42:54.003
Janice, Rose and l

42:54.039 --> 42:56.872
were wondering if it
would be a problem to go

42:56.908 --> 43:00.139
inside and hear what Turner
has to say-- find out what

43:00.178 --> 43:01.145
he's about ourselves.

43:01.179 --> 43:03.943
On one condition...

43:03.982 --> 43:05.711
that you both sit
next to me.

43:05.751 --> 43:09.118
Thank you.

43:09.154 --> 43:11.918
Uh, you know what? l'm gonna
meet you guys inside.

43:11.957 --> 43:13.515
So, Andrea mentioned you

43:13.558 --> 43:16.118
were interviewed for a history
project on the Holocaust.

43:16.161 --> 43:17.628
Yes, l was.

43:17.663 --> 43:20.223
l'd love to watch
it sometime.

43:20.265 --> 43:21.755
So would l.
