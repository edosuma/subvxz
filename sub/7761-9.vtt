00:10.144 --> 00:12.546
- * ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR, FIVE SIX *

00:12.580 --> 00:13.647
* SHAKE IT, DUDE

00:13.681 --> 00:21.622
*

00:35.369 --> 00:37.471
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:37.505 --> 00:46.214
*

00:46.247 --> 00:48.149
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:48.182 --> 00:50.318
*

00:50.351 --> 00:53.621
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:53.654 --> 00:57.325
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:59.193 --> 01:00.828
- [groans]

01:00.861 --> 01:02.830
- ISN'T THIS FUN?

01:02.863 --> 01:07.168
- MAYBE FOR YOU, BUT THAT'S
BECAUSE YOU'RE A SADISTIC SHIT!

01:07.201 --> 01:08.636
- WHO? ME?

01:08.669 --> 01:11.172
- I'LL NEVER TELL YOU
WHERE THE JEWELS ARE!

01:11.205 --> 01:13.107
- MAKE THAT "JEWEL."

01:13.141 --> 01:14.475
NOW LIE STILL.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.110
WHO KNOWS?
IF YOU'RE LUCKY,

01:16.144 --> 01:18.446
YOU MIGHT EVEN GET
A FEW MORE GOOD YEARS,

01:18.479 --> 01:20.848
LIKE ME!
[cackles]

01:20.881 --> 01:24.218
- [screams]

01:24.252 --> 01:28.122
- MR. KINNEY?
MR. KINNEY?

01:28.156 --> 01:31.192
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY,
MR. KINNEY.

01:31.225 --> 01:34.328
WE'LL SEE YOU AGAIN TOMORROW.

01:34.362 --> 01:35.596
AND I SHOULD WARN YOU,

01:35.629 --> 01:37.465
YOU'LL FEEL FINE
FOR THE NEXT FEW HOURS,

01:37.498 --> 01:39.400
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HIT A WALL
AROUND NOON--

01:39.433 --> 01:40.801
NAUSEA, PAIN, FATIGUE.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.603
THEY'RE ALL NORMAL
SIDE EFFECTS.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.638
IN FACT, I WOULD SUGGEST
THAT FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS,

01:44.672 --> 01:46.207
YOU JUST STAY HOME,
TAKE IT EASY.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.541
DON'T GO TO WORK.

01:47.575 --> 01:50.644
- HUH.
THANK YOU, NURSE.

01:50.678 --> 01:54.748
THAT'S EXCELLENT ADVICE.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.617
- FIRST THING WE DO
WHEN WE GET TO HOLLYWOOD

01:56.650 --> 01:58.152
IS GO TO UNIVERSAL STUDIOS.

01:58.186 --> 01:59.653
THE RIDES SOUND AWESOME.

01:59.687 --> 02:01.489
AND THEN WE DO
THE GRAVE LINE TOUR.

02:01.522 --> 02:04.525
IT TAKES YOU TO ALL THE PLACES
WHERE STARS HAVE BEEN MURDERED.

02:04.558 --> 02:05.759
AND THEN--
- THEN WE GO

02:05.793 --> 02:07.561
TO GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATRE,

02:07.595 --> 02:09.830
AND WE STEAL
JOHN WAYNE'S FOOTPRINTS.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.303
LUCY?

02:15.336 --> 02:16.837
I LOVE LUCY?

02:16.870 --> 02:20.641
THEY WENT TO HOLLYWOOD
AND--NEVER MIND.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.643
COULD YOU SAVE ME SOME CEREAL?

02:22.676 --> 02:24.312
- AREN'T YOU BEING
A BIT PREMATURE?

02:24.345 --> 02:26.580
- WHY?
WE'RE GOING, AREN'T WE?

02:26.614 --> 02:28.649
YOU SAID BRETT
TOLD YOU IT WAS A DONE DEAL.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.384
- THAT'S MR. KELLER TO YOU.

02:30.418 --> 02:33.554
AND NOTHING'S A DONE DEAL
UNTIL IT'S DONE.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.689
- I'M DONE.

02:35.723 --> 02:36.924
- BUSY DAY?

02:36.957 --> 02:39.327
- OH, CLASSES,
RESEARCH AT THE LIBRARY,

02:39.360 --> 02:40.961
STUDENT-ADVISOR MEETINGS.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.264
I'M ALSO SUPPOSED TO HEAR
FROM GREENPOINT PRESS.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.199
- ARE THEY INTERESTED
IN YOUR NOVEL?

02:45.233 --> 02:47.301
- HMM, LET'S JUST SAY THE EDITOR
SEEMED RECEPTIVE,

02:47.335 --> 02:49.470
WHICH AT LEAST IS BETTER
THAN ANOTHER REJECTION.

02:49.503 --> 02:53.407
SO KEEP YOUR FINGERS CROSSED.

02:53.441 --> 02:55.543
- HE SHOULD TRY TO EAT
SOME GRAIN IN THE MORNING

02:55.576 --> 02:57.211
INSTEAD OF THOSE CRAPPY SHAKES.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.347
HE'D BE A LOT HAPPIER,
NOT TO MENTION REGULAR.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.282
- I THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE
MORE THAN A BOWL OF BRAN.

03:01.315 --> 03:05.886
AND YOU COULD TRY AND BE
A LITTLE MORE SENSITIVE.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.955
- HUH?
- "HUH?"

03:07.988 --> 03:09.957
BEN IS GOING THROUGH
A TOUGH TIME RIGHT NOW.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.693
I'M SURE ALL THIS TALK
ISN'T MAKING IT ANY EASIER.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.729
SO, FROM NOW ON,
LET'S TRY NOT TO USE

03:15.763 --> 03:18.532
THE WORD "HOLLYWOOD"
IN A SENTENCE.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.438
- WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

03:24.472 --> 03:26.307
- I'M WAITING FOR YOU.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.442
YOU WON'T ANSWER THE DOOR.
YOU WON'T RETURN MY CALLS.

03:28.476 --> 03:30.844
- WELL, THAT SHOULD BE A HINT.
- WHY WON'T YOU SEE ME?

03:30.878 --> 03:32.580
- CYNTHIA!
CYNTHIA!

03:32.613 --> 03:34.014
- JESUS, BRIAN,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

03:34.047 --> 03:35.749
- YOU CAN'T JUST KICK ME OUT.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.319
- WATCH ME.
I DON'T WANT HIS CALLS.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.254
I DON'T WANT HIM IN THIS OFFICE,
AND IF HE COMES NEAR ME,

03:40.288 --> 03:44.725
I WANT A RESTRAINING ORDER.
GOT IT?

03:44.758 --> 03:47.661
AND IF SOME ASSHOLE NAMED
VIC GRASSI CALLS FROM HELL,

03:47.695 --> 03:50.364
YOU CAN TELL HIM
I'M IN A MEETING.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.609
- WELL, VIC,
IT'S NOT QUITE THE HEADSTONE

04:01.642 --> 04:04.578
I'D ORIGINALLY INTENDED.

04:06.314 --> 04:07.881
- BUT AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD,

04:07.915 --> 04:11.352
MICHELANGELO'S NOT TAKING
ANY MORE COMMISSIONS.

04:11.385 --> 04:12.753
- BUT IT'S SOLID.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.289
IT'S HARD, SMOOTH.

04:15.323 --> 04:17.024
COME TO THINK OF IT,

04:17.057 --> 04:19.660
THAT'S A LOT OF THE ATTRIBUTES
YOU LIKED IN A MAN.

04:19.693 --> 04:21.495
[both laugh]

04:21.529 --> 04:24.365
- WHOEVER INVENTS A CELL
PHONE THAT'S ALSO A VIBRATOR

04:24.398 --> 04:27.668
IS GOING TO MAKE A FORTUNE.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.303
EXCUSE ME, DEB.

04:29.337 --> 04:30.838
- YEAH.
DON'T WORRY, HONEY.

04:30.871 --> 04:33.974
- HELLO?
- VIC'S IN NO HURRY.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.776
- OH, HEY...
- SO I'LL PLANT FLOWERS

04:35.809 --> 04:40.648
THIS SPRING
AND MAKE IT MORE HOMEY, OKAY?

04:40.681 --> 04:44.318
AND, UM...

04:44.352 --> 04:47.688
VIC, I JUST WANT TO SAY,

04:47.721 --> 04:50.424
WHEREVER YOU ARE...

04:50.458 --> 04:52.693
OF COURSE I KNOW WHERE YOU ARE.
YOU'RE IN HEAVEN.

04:52.726 --> 04:56.564
WHERE THE HELL
ELSE WOULD YOU BE?

04:56.597 --> 05:01.835
THAT, UM, IN SPITE
OF OUR LITTLE FALLING OUT,

05:01.869 --> 05:04.672
NOT--NOT THAT
IT WAS SO LITTLE--

05:04.705 --> 05:09.610
IT NEARLY PUT ME
IN THE GROUND BESIDE YOU--

05:09.643 --> 05:11.745
THAT I LOVE YOU...

05:11.779 --> 05:15.483
WITH ALL MY HEART.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.685
YOU KNOW THAT, BABY,
DON'T YOU?

05:17.718 --> 05:20.888
- ARRESTED?

05:20.921 --> 05:24.124
- AND THAT I HOPE THAT YOU'VE
FORGIVEN ME FOR WHAT I DID.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.493
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

05:25.526 --> 05:27.961
D.U.I.?

05:27.995 --> 05:29.997
WELL, WHO'S GOING TO HELP ME
CATER THE PARTY TONIGHT?

05:30.030 --> 05:32.433
- AND ALL BECAUSE
OF THIS SILLY PARTY.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.502
- NO, I WILL NOT RECOMMEND
AN ATTORNEY,

05:34.535 --> 05:36.003
UNLESS YOU RECOMMEND A CHEF.

05:36.036 --> 05:39.106
- REST IN PEACE,
LITTLE BROTHER.

05:39.139 --> 05:42.376
- ROT IN HELL,
YOU LITTLE FUCKER.

05:42.410 --> 05:46.780
OH, VIC, VIC,
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO DIE?

05:46.814 --> 05:48.649
- I KNOW, HONEY.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.018
I KNOW,
BUT HE'S IN A BETTER PLACE.

05:53.621 --> 05:55.589
- IT'S A WARM
AND WONDERFUL PLACE,

05:55.623 --> 05:57.858
FILLED WITH LOVE
AND POSSIBILITIES.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.460
- YOU'LL HAVE
TO FORGIVE MY WIFE.

05:59.493 --> 06:00.994
SHE TENDS TO WAX POETIC

06:01.028 --> 06:02.730
IN DIRECT PROPORTION
TO THE SIZE OF MY TUMMY.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.498
- OH, COME ON,
YOU'VE DONE YOUR FAIR SHARE

06:04.532 --> 06:07.601
OF WAXING YOURSELF.
- I'VE NEVER ONCE WAXED.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.870
AND EVEN IF I DID,
OUR PALTRY EXPRESSIONS

06:09.903 --> 06:12.172
WOULD PALE IN COMPARISON
TO MICHAEL'S RHAPSODIZING.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.807
- [scoffs]
- HOLY SHIT!

06:13.841 --> 06:15.509
WOULD YOU CHECK OUT
THE DICK ON THIS KID?

06:15.543 --> 06:17.911
- OR NOT.
- THAT'S THE UMBILICAL CORD.

06:17.945 --> 06:21.749
- AND BESIDES, YOU CAN'T TELL
FROM THIS IF IT'S A BOY OR GIRL,

06:21.782 --> 06:25.619
ALTHOUGH SOMETHING TELLS ME
A PRINCESS IS ON THE WAY.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.187
- WELL, IT'S OKAY WITH ME
IF HE'S GAY.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.923
- I GOT TO RUN.
[smooches]

06:29.957 --> 06:31.759
WE'RE INSTALLING
THE AUERBACH SHOW.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.160
- DON'T FORGET LAMAZE.

06:33.193 --> 06:37.097
- JESUS.
YOU THINK WE COULD MOVE IT?

06:37.130 --> 06:38.766
- HEY, WHY DON'T I GO?

06:38.799 --> 06:40.167
both: YOU?

06:40.200 --> 06:41.769
- IS IT A CLASS
FOR LESBIAN MOTHERS?

06:41.802 --> 06:43.070
I WON'T SHAVE MY LEGS.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.638
NO ONE WILL NOTICE.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.039
- [laughs]
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.509
- GOOD. THEN IT'LL SERVE
AS A GENTLE REMINDER

06:48.542 --> 06:50.511
THAT UNTIL SOMEONE COMES UP
WITH A BETTER PLAN,

06:50.544 --> 06:52.646
YOU STILL NEED A MAN
FOR SOME THINGS.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.582
HEY, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

06:54.615 --> 06:56.650
I NEED THOSE PANELS SO I CAN
COME UP WITH SOME DIALOGUE

06:56.684 --> 06:57.985
FOR THE EVIL ANAL PROBERS.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.020
- HOW ABOUT, "UP YOUR ASS"?

07:02.490 --> 07:04.424
- SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.930
HEY.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.599
HEY!
WHAT'S WITH YOU?

07:11.632 --> 07:12.966
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

07:13.000 --> 07:16.870
YOU TOLD HIM THAT WE KNEW,
DIDN'T YOU?

07:16.904 --> 07:19.473
- LOOK, I-I DIDN'T MEANT TO.

07:19.507 --> 07:21.675
IT JUST--
- WHAT, SLIPPED OUT?

07:21.709 --> 07:23.477
"WE KNOW YOU HAVE CANCER."

07:23.511 --> 07:25.979
THAT IS THE FUCKING LAMEST
EXCUSE I'VE EVER HEARD.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.948
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID
THAT WE SHOULD BE STRONG

07:27.981 --> 07:29.683
AND HONOR HIS WISHES.
- I'M SORRY.

07:29.717 --> 07:31.118
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW HARD THAT'S BEEN?

07:31.151 --> 07:32.620
WHY ARE YOU SORRY?

07:32.653 --> 07:34.722
DID HE KICK YOU OUT?

07:34.755 --> 07:37.157
DID HE SAY HE NEVER WANTED
TO SEE YOU AGAIN?

07:37.190 --> 07:38.759
WELL, IF THAT'S
THE WAY HE WANTS IT,

07:38.792 --> 07:41.729
I'LL BE GLAD TO HONOR
THOSE WISHES TOO.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.140
- THERE YOU GO.
- OKAY, THANK YOU.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.244
- PROFESSOR BRUCKNER.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.647
- THAT'S ME.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.981
- I'M SURE
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.282
I WAS IN YOUR 110 SEMINAR
LAST YEAR.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.752
- THERE WERE SO MANY STUDENTS
IN THAT SEMINAR.

08:04.785 --> 08:05.986
- ANTHONY FLYNN.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.921
- I HOPE YOU ENJOYED IT.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.657
- [chuckles]
IT WAS GREAT.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.726
IN FACT, I EVEN WENT OUT
AND BOUGHT YOUR BOOK, RU12.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.729
- OH.
DID YOU READ IT?

08:15.763 --> 08:16.997
- A FEW TIMES, ACTUALLY.

08:17.030 --> 08:17.998
I LOVED IT.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.800
SO WELL WRITTEN.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.902
YOU KNOW, I AGREE WITH WHAT
THE CRITICS SAID ON THE JACKET.

08:21.935 --> 08:25.606
- OH. SEND THEM A FREE COPY,
THEY'LL SAY ANYTHING.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.642
- NO, I'D--I'D REALLY LIKE TO
TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT SOME TIME.

08:28.676 --> 08:31.545
YOU SEE, I'M A WRITER TOO--
WELL, TRYING TO BE.

08:31.579 --> 08:34.014
- AS MUCH
AS I'D LIKE THAT, ANTHONY,

08:34.047 --> 08:36.884
IT'S, UH, MY POLICY NOT TO
FRATERNIZE WITH MY STUDENTS.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.185
- EVEN FORMER ONES?

08:40.721 --> 08:43.791
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO PUT
YOU IN AN AWKWARD POSITION.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.559
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

08:45.593 --> 08:47.561
- IT'S JUST THAT YOUR BOOK
REALLY SPOKE TO ME...

08:47.595 --> 08:48.762
AS A GAY MAN, I MEAN.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.764
BY THE TIME I'D FINISHED IT,

08:50.798 --> 08:54.001
I FELT I'D DISCOVERED THINGS
ABOUT MYSELF I'D NEVER KNOWN.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.538
- THANK YOU.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.642
FLYNN.

09:01.675 --> 09:04.778
YEAH, YOU USED TO SIT
ABOUT HALFWAY BACK,

09:04.812 --> 09:07.180
WAY OVER ON THE RIGHT BY
THE WINDOW WITH THE FIRE ESCAPE.

09:07.214 --> 09:10.117
- [chuckles]
THAT'S ME.

09:11.819 --> 09:14.655
- IT'S A SIMPLE
BUT ELEGANT MENU--

09:14.688 --> 09:16.724
LOBSTER, FILET MIGNON, SALAD,

09:16.757 --> 09:19.192
AND, OF COURSE, DESSERT.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.194
UH-HUH.

09:21.228 --> 09:24.732
UH-HUH.
NO, SURE. I UNDERSTAND.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.202
WELL, THAT WAS
THE LAST POSSIBILITY.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.338
- AH, POOR EM.

09:31.371 --> 09:34.875
I KEEP FORGETTING HOW IMPORTANT
VIC WAS TO YOU TOO, HONEY.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.978
WITHOUT HIM,
YOUR BUSINESS IS FUCKED, HUH?

09:38.011 --> 09:41.348
BUT NEVER FEAR,
'CAUSE HELP IS HERE.

09:41.381 --> 09:44.217
- WHERE?
- YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.954
I'LL CANCEL MY SHIFT TONIGHT.
I'LL LEND YOU A HAND.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.222
- OH, THANKS, BUT, UH,
I NEED MORE THAN A HAND.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.691
I NEED AN ENTIRE BODY,

09:50.724 --> 09:52.893
PREFERABLY ONE BELONGING
TO A CHEF.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.828
- WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH MY COOKING?

09:54.862 --> 09:56.964
- DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY,
BUT NOT EVERYTHING IS COVERED

09:56.997 --> 09:58.999
IN MARINARA SAUCE.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.600
- FINE.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.638
- THE OCTOBER DETECTIVE?

10:04.672 --> 10:06.707
- HMM.
IT'S ONE IN A SERIES.

10:06.740 --> 10:07.708
- OF 12?

10:07.741 --> 10:09.643
- HOW DID YOU GUESS?

10:09.677 --> 10:12.913
- WHEN IT COMES TO CLUES,
I'M QUICK.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.915
FOR INSTANCE,
I'VE, UH, NEVER KNOWN YOU

10:14.948 --> 10:16.850
TO READ DETECTIVE NOVELS.

10:16.884 --> 10:18.719
- SO?

10:18.752 --> 10:22.255
- SO I WOULD SURMISE, USING MY
BRILLIANT POWERS OF DEDUCTION,

10:22.289 --> 10:26.727
THAT IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH ONE LIEUTENANT HORVATH.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.328
- SORRY, SHERLOCK.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.330
CARL CAME HERE
STRICTLY AS A FRIEND,

10:30.363 --> 10:32.132
AND THERE'S NOTHING BETWEEN US.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.401
- THE LOOK IN HIS EYES
SAID OTHERWISE.

10:34.434 --> 10:37.437
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE LOOK IN A MAN'S--

10:37.470 --> 10:39.339
NEVER MIND.
I TAKE IT BACK.

10:41.775 --> 10:44.077
- STOP LIVING IN A BOOK

10:44.111 --> 10:47.881
AND START LIVING YOUR LIFE.

10:47.915 --> 10:51.151
MMM, GOD, THIS CHOCOLATE MOUSSE
IS SCRUMPTIOUS.

10:51.184 --> 10:54.421
PERHAPS I UNDERESTIMATED
YOUR CULINARY SKILLS.

10:54.454 --> 10:58.458
- MY CHOCOLATE MOUSSE
IS COVERED IN MARINARA SAUCE.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.728
THIS IS FROM
THAT SWEET KID DARREN--

11:00.761 --> 11:02.763
YOU KNOW,
THE ONE WHO GOT BASHED.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.297
I SENT HIM FOOD EVERY DAY
FROM THE DINER,

11:04.331 --> 11:06.166
AND NOW HE SENDS
ME GOODIES BACK--

11:06.199 --> 11:08.101
KIND OF LIKE A THANK-YOU.

11:08.135 --> 11:10.303
AND HE DOES IT ALL HIMSELF.

11:10.337 --> 11:13.440
I TELL YOU, HE CAN DANCE.
HE CAN COOK.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.308
HE'S A KNOCKOUT IN A DRESS.

11:15.342 --> 11:19.346
HE'LL BE A REAL CATCH
FOR SOME LUCKY GUY.

11:19.379 --> 11:23.050
[door closes]
EM?

11:23.083 --> 11:25.185
EM?

11:25.218 --> 11:27.220
WHERE THE FUCK HE GO?

11:29.990 --> 11:31.691
- BRIAN?

11:40.433 --> 11:42.369
BRIAN?

11:45.773 --> 11:48.075
JESUS CHRIST, WHAT'S WRONG?

11:48.108 --> 11:49.943
- NOTHING.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.879
I'M FINE.
WHY DO YOU ASK?

11:51.912 --> 11:53.380
- WELL, FOR ONE THING,
YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.248
- THANK YOU.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.222
- OKAY, LOOK, NOW, THIS IS THE
SECOND TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.757
- FUCKING ACCOUNTANTS--

12:03.791 --> 12:05.225
DO YOU HAVE TO KEEP A RECORD
OF EVERYTHING?

12:05.258 --> 12:08.495
- I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT YOU CAN TRUST ME,

12:08.528 --> 12:11.531
AS A FRIEND AND AS SOMEONE
WHO HAS BEEN THROUGH IT ALL.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.433
I MEAN, THERE IS NOTHING
I HAVEN'T SEEN OR DONE,

12:13.466 --> 12:16.169
WHICH IS WHY I DON'T PRESUME
TO JUDGE ANYONE.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.405
BUT THERE'S ONE THING I KNOW--

12:18.438 --> 12:22.776
THE FIRST AND HARDEST STEP
YOU'LL EVER HAVE TO TAKE...

12:22.810 --> 12:24.511
IS ADMITTING
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

12:24.544 --> 12:27.114
AND ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT,
YOU'RE ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY--

12:27.147 --> 12:31.151
- IT'S THE BIG "C," TED.
[scoffs]

12:35.088 --> 12:39.059
- COCAINE?
- [laughs]

12:39.092 --> 12:41.294
IT'S BIGGER.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.196
- CRYSTAL?

12:43.230 --> 12:45.198
- BIGGER.

12:45.232 --> 12:47.400
- CAFFEINE?

12:47.434 --> 12:51.038
- IT'S CANCER, THEODORE.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.042
- C-C-C-C--

12:55.075 --> 12:57.044
- YEAH.

12:58.211 --> 13:01.448
BUT RELAX.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.817
THEY GOT IT.

13:03.851 --> 13:07.354
I'M IN RADIATION.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.422
STARTED THIS MORNING.

13:09.456 --> 13:12.392
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A MOMENT?

13:17.630 --> 13:20.800
[vomits]

13:25.472 --> 13:28.808
[spits, coughs]

13:37.350 --> 13:40.053
- I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW RELIEVED I AM.

13:40.087 --> 13:41.454
- I MEAN, THAT--

13:41.488 --> 13:44.557
THAT YOU'RE GONNA
BE ALL RIGHT.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.895
- THANK YOU.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.105
- IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO?

13:58.138 --> 13:59.472
- YEAH, AS A MATTER OF FACT,

13:59.506 --> 14:03.010
YOU CAN DO THREE THINGS.

14:03.043 --> 14:06.079
FIRST...
[scoffs]

14:06.113 --> 14:08.882
YOU KEEP YOUR BIG MOUTH SHUT,

14:08.916 --> 14:10.083
OR YOU'RE FIRED.

14:10.117 --> 14:12.986
- SEALING. SEALING.
SECOND?

14:13.020 --> 14:16.957
- I WANT YOU TO COVER
FOR ME THIS AFTERNOON

14:16.990 --> 14:18.959
WITH DANDY LUBE.

14:18.992 --> 14:21.294
- WAIT.
COVER F-FOR YOU?

14:21.328 --> 14:22.963
- MAKE THE PRESENTATION.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.498
- BUT I--
- LOOK, IF YOU COULD PRETEND

14:25.532 --> 14:27.367
THAT YOU WERE PAVAROTTI

14:27.400 --> 14:31.504
AT THAT PATHETIC PASTA PALACE,

14:31.538 --> 14:34.141
YOU CAN DO THIS.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.178
- [sniffs]
WHAT'S THE THIRD?

14:38.211 --> 14:40.180
- CALL ME A CAB.

14:42.315 --> 14:45.018
I'M GOING HOME.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.992
- AND THE PART WHERE ALL YOUR
FRIENDS WERE TURNING POSITIVE--

14:52.025 --> 14:53.994
- HOW ABOUT OVER THERE?
- UH, FINE.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.529
- BUT YOU STILL
HADN'T BEEN INFECTED.

14:56.563 --> 15:00.400
- YEAH, I REMEMBER FEELING
TERRIFIED THAT I'D BE NEXT.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.170
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

15:03.203 --> 15:05.605
FEELING LIKE I JUST WANTED
TO GET IT OVER WITH.

15:05.638 --> 15:08.408
- THEN WHEN YOU CONVERTED,
IT--IT PUT YOU

15:08.441 --> 15:10.410
IN A WHOLE
DIFFERENT PLACE.

15:10.443 --> 15:14.681
- SPIRITUALLY, EMOTIONALLY,
POLITICALLY.

15:14.714 --> 15:18.085
- YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
IT WAS VERY MOVING.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.028
- ANTHONY, MAY I ASK YOU
A PERSONAL QUESTION?

15:28.061 --> 15:30.497
- I FEEL LIKE I ALREADY KNOW
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU,

15:30.530 --> 15:32.032
IT'S ONLY FAIR.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.967
- ARE YOU POSITIVE?

15:34.001 --> 15:36.336
- NO.

15:36.369 --> 15:39.072
BUT YOUR BOOK STILL SPOKE TO ME.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.208
AND ISN'T THAT THE MEASURE
OF ANY GREAT BOOK...

15:41.241 --> 15:42.509
- [scoffs]
- THAT IT SPEAKS TO EVERYONE?

15:42.542 --> 15:45.178
- OH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

15:45.212 --> 15:48.115
I MEAN, ABOUT IT BEING
A GREAT BOOK, BUT THANKS.

15:48.148 --> 15:51.384
- SO THE QUESTION IS,
WHEN'S THE NEXT ONE COMING OUT?

15:51.418 --> 15:54.387
- MM, THAT IS THE QUESTION.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.456
JUST FINISHED A NOVEL
ABOUT TWO MEN,

15:56.489 --> 15:58.458
SET IN PARIS IN THE '30s.

15:58.491 --> 15:59.759
- SOUNDS GREAT.
- MM-HMM.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.461
THERE ARE
A COUPLE DOZEN PUBLISHERS

16:01.494 --> 16:02.462
WHO DON'T AGREE WITH YOU.

16:02.495 --> 16:05.132
THEY'VE ALL TURNED IT DOWN.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.733
- WELL, I'D LOVE TO READ IT...

16:06.766 --> 16:10.337
IF YOU'D LET ME.
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.605
- HEY,
I'M AN ENGLISH-LIT MAJOR,

16:12.639 --> 16:15.508
A BUDDING YOUNG WRITER,
AND I WORK IN A LIBRARY.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.211
OH, AND I GOT AN "A"
IN YOUR COURSE.

16:18.245 --> 16:19.746
THAT SHOULD QUALIFY ME TO KNOW

16:19.779 --> 16:21.848
A LITTLE SOMETHING
ABOUT GOOD WRITING.

16:25.718 --> 16:28.755
- AT THE RISK
OF LOSING A FAN...

16:28.788 --> 16:32.392
- OR GAINING
AN EVEN BIGGER ONE.

16:32.425 --> 16:36.263
[chuckles]

16:36.296 --> 16:39.666
- * I'D BE THE "MAN"
IN MANKIND *

16:39.699 --> 16:42.235
* AND THE UNIVERSAL HE

16:42.269 --> 16:44.437
* EVERY DOOR
THAT ONCE WAS SHUT *

16:44.471 --> 16:46.639
* WOULD OPEN FOR ME

16:46.673 --> 16:49.309
* IF I WERE A MAN

16:49.342 --> 16:53.813
* IF I WERE A MAN, I'D LIKE
TO MEET SOMEBODY LIKE ME *

16:53.846 --> 16:59.686
* IF I WERE A MAN, I'D LIKE
TO MEET SOMEBODY LIKE ME *

17:01.454 --> 17:04.391
- BRAVO!
[laughs]

17:04.424 --> 17:06.726
I MEAN, BRAVA!

17:06.759 --> 17:08.428
I'M, UM, EMMETT HONEYCUTT.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.130
I LIVE WITH DEBBIE NOVOTNY.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.065
WE MET AT THE "SO WHAT
IF IT'S NOT CHRISTMAS?

17:12.099 --> 17:13.666
WE'RE HAVING A CHRISTMAS PARTY
ANYWAY" PARTY.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.068
- RIGHT.

17:15.102 --> 17:17.137
- YOU ARE FABULOUS.

17:17.170 --> 17:20.140
I JUST LOVE THE ROUTINES,
THE GOWNS...

17:20.173 --> 17:22.475
THE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE.

17:22.509 --> 17:23.543
- EXCUSE ME?

17:23.576 --> 17:26.613
- I'M A PARTY PLANNER.

17:26.646 --> 17:31.618
DEBBIE'S BROTHER, VIC, UH, WAS
MY CHEF BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.454
HE'S GONE NOW,
BUT OUR BUSINESS ISN'T.

17:34.487 --> 17:38.825
AND IF ANYONE KNOWS THE SHOW
MUST GO ON, IT'S YOU, SO...

17:38.858 --> 17:41.628
- YOU WANT SHANDA LEER
TO PERFORM AT A PARTY?

17:41.661 --> 17:46.566
NO, I WANT DARREN
TO COOK FOR A PARTY.

17:46.599 --> 17:48.568
- BUT, UH...

17:48.601 --> 17:50.770
[whispering]
I'M NOT A CHEF.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.473
- WELL, YOU DO A FABULOUS
IMPERSONATION OF THAT TOO.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.175
I MEAN, THOSE DELICACIES

17:55.208 --> 17:57.577
YOU'VE BEEN SENDING OVER
TO DEB'S ARE TO DIE FOR.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.512
NO OFFENSE, VIC.

17:59.546 --> 18:04.184
- I'D LOVE TO HELP YOU OUT,
BUT SHANDA'S MAKING A COMEBACK.

18:04.217 --> 18:07.587
[exhales sharply]
GOD, I HATE THAT WORD.

18:07.620 --> 18:11.258
IT'S A...RETURN.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.625
THERE'S JUST NO TIME.

18:12.659 --> 18:16.629
- WELL, YOU CAN'T BLAME
A GIRL FOR TRYING.

18:17.930 --> 18:21.768
GOOD LUCK.
UH, BREAK A LEG.

18:24.504 --> 18:28.875
- * IF I WERE A MAN

18:28.908 --> 18:30.877
- DAMN.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.245
- DIDN'T MEAN IT LITERALLY.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.614
- LOOK AT THIS.
RUINED.

18:34.647 --> 18:38.818
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THESE SATIN
PUMPS IN A SIZE 11 1/2 COST?

18:38.851 --> 18:43.356
NOT TO MENTION
THE NEW GOWNS AND THE HAIR.

18:43.390 --> 18:44.824
SHANDA MAY BE A STAR,

18:44.857 --> 18:48.795
BUT SHE'S GOING TO DRIVE ME
TO THE POORHOUSE.

18:48.828 --> 18:51.831
- HONEY, LET'S REVIEW.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.700
YOU NEED DOUGH,

18:53.733 --> 18:55.902
AND I NEED SOMEONE TO STUFF IT

18:55.935 --> 18:58.538
WITH SPINACH
AND PORCINI MUSHROOMS.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.244
[bell jingles]
- MAIL'S HERE.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.246
- SINCE WHEN DO I GET
SPECIAL DELIVERY?

19:06.279 --> 19:07.914
- SINCE THIS ARRIVED
FROM THAT PLACE

19:07.947 --> 19:11.384
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO USE IN A SENTENCE.

19:11.418 --> 19:14.921
- IT'S FROM BRETT.
- YOU MEAN MR. KELLER?

19:14.954 --> 19:18.625
STOP STARING AND OPEN
THE GODDAMN LETTER ALREADY.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.862
WELL?

19:22.895 --> 19:25.265
- IT'S TWO CHECKS--
ONE MADE OUT TO JUSTIN,

19:25.298 --> 19:28.301
ONE MADE OUT TO ME,
EACH FOR $10,000.

19:28.335 --> 19:31.404
- $10,000--OH, MY GOD!

19:31.438 --> 19:33.906
[both cheer]

19:36.443 --> 19:37.577
WE'RE RICH!

19:37.610 --> 19:39.446
- NOT QUITE.
- BUT WE WILL BE.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.548
- JUST IMAGINE,
RAGE ON THE SILVER SCREEN,

19:41.581 --> 19:42.882
BIG-BUDGET SPECIAL EFFECTS.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.285
- MILLIONS IN
FAST-FOOD-MERCHANDISING TIE-INS.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.687
- TOM CRUISE PUMPING AWAY
IN HOT, SUPERHERO MAN-SEX.

19:47.720 --> 19:48.988
- CAREFUL.
HE'LL SUE YOUR ASS.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.491
- CAN'T SUE SOMEONE
FOR DREAMING.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.826
- SPEAKING OF DREAMS,
THIS CAME TOO.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.329
IT'S FROM GREENPOINT PRESS.

19:56.363 --> 19:59.299
- WELL, YOU CAN'T OPEN
SOMEONE ELSE'S MAIL.

19:59.332 --> 20:00.833
IT'S A FEDERAL OFFENSE.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.569
- I CAN SEE IT NOW.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.471
I'M ON DEATH ROW,
AWAITING LETHAL INJECTION.

20:04.504 --> 20:07.307
THIS MASS MURDERER WHO KILLED
48 BABIES AND ATE THEM

20:07.340 --> 20:09.609
ASKS ME
WHAT I'M BEING EXECUTED FOR.

20:09.642 --> 20:12.445
I SAY, "OPENING BEN'S LETTER."

20:12.479 --> 20:14.013
- STILL, IT'S NOT ETHICAL.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.316
- ETHICAL, SHMETHICAL.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.885
OOPS.
TOO LATE.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.587
SHOULD I SEAL IT BACK UP?

20:20.620 --> 20:22.755
- WELL, I SUPPOSE
SINCE IT'S ALREADY OPEN...

20:22.789 --> 20:25.358
- THAT'S WHAT I LIKE--
A MAN WITH VALUES.

20:27.827 --> 20:30.930
- WELL?

20:30.963 --> 20:34.734
- THEY THINK IT SUCKS.
- SHIT.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.536
SHIT.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.906
BEN'S GOING TO BE SO UPSET.
- NOT IF HE NEVER GETS IT.

20:39.939 --> 20:42.909
- GIVE ME THAT.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.916
- MM.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.620
- AM I INTERRUPTING?

20:53.653 --> 20:55.922
- JUST ABOUT
TO DEVOUR MY MANWICH.

20:55.955 --> 20:59.025
- IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD,
THAT'S THREE GUYS FUCKING.

20:59.058 --> 21:03.630
- COME ON IN.
HAVE A SEAT.

21:03.663 --> 21:06.032
HOW YOU DOING?

21:06.065 --> 21:07.500
- BETTER...

21:07.534 --> 21:09.369
THANKS IN NO SMALL PART
TO YOU.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.037
- I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT.

21:11.070 --> 21:13.773
- I'M--I'M SORRY
YOU'RE FINISHING LUNCH,

21:13.806 --> 21:16.075
'CAUSE I WAS GONNA TAKE YOU UP
ON YOUR OFFER--

21:16.108 --> 21:20.046
YOU KNOW, STEP OUT,
HAVE A BITE.

21:20.079 --> 21:22.982
BUT I HAVE TO WARN YOU, CARL,
I HAVEN'T CHANGED MUCH.

21:23.015 --> 21:25.785
I STILL GOT A BIG MOUTH,
AND I STILL SPEAK MY MIND,

21:25.818 --> 21:29.055
AND I'M STILL AS STUBBORN
AS A PROM-WEEK PIMPLE.

21:29.088 --> 21:31.458
[both laugh]

21:31.491 --> 21:36.329
BUT IF THAT'S STILL OKAY WITH
YOU, THEN HOW ABOUT DINNER?

21:36.363 --> 21:37.997
- DEBBIE--
- I'VE BEEN HAVING THESE DREAMS

21:38.030 --> 21:39.666
ABOUT LOBSTER LATELY.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.734
I'M ADRIFT ON THIS SEA
OF MELTED BUTTER AND--

21:41.768 --> 21:44.003
- DEBBIE.
- WHAT?

21:44.036 --> 21:46.573
- I'VE BEEN SEEING SOMEONE.

21:48.875 --> 21:50.543
- OH.

21:50.577 --> 21:52.479
- COUPLE OF MONTHS NOW.

21:52.512 --> 21:54.414
HER NAME'S KATHARINE.

21:54.447 --> 21:57.984
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

21:58.017 --> 22:01.020
- SEE, WHEN I ASKED YOU
IF YOU WANTED TO GET A BITE,

22:01.053 --> 22:02.955
IT WAS AS FRIENDS.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.357
I HOPE I DIDN'T GIVE YOU
THE WRONG--

22:04.391 --> 22:06.025
- OH, NO, NO,
NOT AT ALL.

22:08.861 --> 22:11.097
KATHARINE...

22:11.130 --> 22:13.966
I HAD AN AUNT NAMED KATHARINE.
SHE WAS A GREAT LADY.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.835
SHE WAS NAMED
AFTER KATHARINE HEPBURN--

22:15.868 --> 22:17.470
ANOTHER GREAT LADY.

22:22.141 --> 22:25.545
WELL, I'M VERY HAPPY
FOR YOU, CARL.

22:27.046 --> 22:29.348
I TRULY AM.

22:36.623 --> 22:39.158
- THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
OUR LUBE AND THEIR LUBE

22:39.191 --> 22:41.994
IS OUR LUBE SAYS...

22:42.028 --> 22:45.398
"SEX."

22:45.432 --> 22:46.733
IF YOU, UH...

22:46.766 --> 22:49.736
[clears throat]
IF YOU WANT TO BE COOL,

22:49.769 --> 22:51.170
IF YOU WANT TO BE POPULAR,

22:51.203 --> 22:55.041
IF YOU WANT TO GET LAID,
THIS IS THE LUBE YOU USE...

22:57.810 --> 23:01.448
ON YOUR CAR, I MEAN.

23:01.481 --> 23:04.884
- I FAIL TO SEE
HOW GETTING AN OIL CHANGE

23:04.917 --> 23:09.556
OR HAVING YOUR TIRES ROTATED
CAN IMPROVE YOUR SEX LIFE.

23:09.589 --> 23:12.058
- WELL, SEE,
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.

23:12.091 --> 23:14.160
- I'M WRONG?

23:14.193 --> 23:18.831
- NOT--NOT WRONG.
I MEAN, UH, JUST NOT RIGHT.

23:18.865 --> 23:22.201
- WHAT HE MEANS
IS THAT WITH A SEXIER,

23:22.234 --> 23:23.936
MORE PLAYFUL NEW IMAGE,

23:23.970 --> 23:26.906
YOU CAN EXPAND DANDY LUBE'S
SHARE OF THE MARKET.

23:26.939 --> 23:28.641
- YEAH, THAT--THAT'S IT.

23:28.675 --> 23:30.042
THAT'S--
WHAT SHE SAID.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.812
- BY SUGGESTING
WE HAVE HALF-NAKED MUSCLE BOYS

23:32.845 --> 23:35.915
OFFERING LUBE-JOBS IN A,
UH, CLOTHING-OPTIONAL GARAGE?

23:35.948 --> 23:38.785
- BY APPEALING TO WOMEN
AND GAY MEN.

23:38.818 --> 23:41.521
- THAT'S
AN INTERESTING POINT, DAD.

23:41.554 --> 23:45.191
GAYS ARE AN IMPORTANT
DEMOGRAPHIC THESE DAYS.

23:45.224 --> 23:48.127
- WELL, WE'RE MEETING
WITH VANGARD THIS AFTERNOON.

23:48.160 --> 23:52.465
I'M SURE THEY'LL HAVE A MORE,
UH, STRAIGHTFORWARD APPROACH.

23:52.499 --> 23:54.767
COMING, DOUG?

23:59.572 --> 24:01.741
- COULD YOU DIRECT ME
TO THE MEN'S ROOM?

24:01.774 --> 24:04.877
- IT'S DOWN THE HALL
TO YOUR LEFT.

24:08.848 --> 24:11.551
THAT'D BE YOUR CUE.
- MY CUE?

24:11.584 --> 24:15.087
- TO NAIL THE ACCOUNT.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.689
- OH, NO, I COULDN'T.
I MEAN--

24:16.723 --> 24:18.558
WELL, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT HE--

24:18.591 --> 24:21.494
SUPPOSE HE'S NOT, AND I--
- WELL, IT NEVER STOPPED BRIAN.

24:21.528 --> 24:23.996
MAKE HIM PROUD.

24:24.030 --> 24:26.999
- [sighs]

24:41.213 --> 24:44.851
- YOUR PRESENTATION
WAS VERY...

24:44.884 --> 24:46.185
INTERESTING.

24:46.218 --> 24:47.987
- [scoffs]

24:48.020 --> 24:50.523
YOUR FATHER
DIDN'T SEEM TO THINK SO.

24:50.557 --> 24:54.594
- DAD JUST HEARS
THE INITIAL PITCHES, AND...

24:54.627 --> 24:56.763
THEN IT'S UP TO ME
TO FOLLOW THROUGH.

25:01.668 --> 25:04.637
SO DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU'D LIKE TO SHOW ME?

25:10.710 --> 25:12.511
- YEAH.

25:14.814 --> 25:16.549
THIS.

25:22.789 --> 25:25.091
- PERFECT TIMING.

25:25.124 --> 25:28.060
YOUR DRAWINGS HAVE JUST
COME BACK FROM THE FRAMER'S.

25:30.663 --> 25:32.164
DON'T YOU LIKE IT?

25:32.198 --> 25:34.333
- I ALREADY KNOW
WHAT MY STUFF LOOKS LIKE.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.835
I'M FAR MORE INTERESTED

25:35.868 --> 25:37.336
IN SEEING SOMETHING
THAT ISN'T MINE.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.038
- OH, THAT'S NOTHING.

25:39.071 --> 25:41.107
JUST A MINOR PIECE
BY AN UNKNOWN ARTIST.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.309
- PETERSON.
"FIGURE STUDY."

25:43.342 --> 25:45.177
- SAM, SAM. WAIT.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.680
I-I'M NOT SURE
YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE IT.

25:47.714 --> 25:48.981
I'M NOT EVEN SURE I LIKE IT.

25:49.015 --> 25:51.183
- THEN WHY'D YOU HAVE IT FRAMED?

25:51.217 --> 25:55.054
- GOOD QUESTION.
[breathing heavily]

25:55.087 --> 25:56.823
- SOMETHING WRONG?

25:56.856 --> 25:59.358
- NO.
NOTHING.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.194
WHY DO YOU ASK?
- YOU'RE HYPERVENTILATING.

26:02.228 --> 26:05.197
- [breathing heavily]

26:05.231 --> 26:06.966
- YOU BETTER SIT DOWN.

26:06.999 --> 26:09.068
WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO DO
SOMETHING GIRLIE, LIKE FAINT.

26:09.101 --> 26:10.737
- EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

26:10.770 --> 26:13.706
SAM AUERBACH ISN'T ABOUT
TO EVALUATE YOUR WORK.

26:16.042 --> 26:17.944
- HO-LY SHIT!

26:17.977 --> 26:19.245
- I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT.
- NO.

26:19.278 --> 26:21.013
- DON'T LOOK.
- WOULD YOU SIT DOWN

26:21.047 --> 26:23.983
AND SHUT UP?

26:27.419 --> 26:29.689
YOU FLATTER ME, MY DEAR...

26:29.722 --> 26:31.758
BY AT LEAST A COUPLE INCHES.

26:31.791 --> 26:35.695
- WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF YOU?
- DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ME.

26:35.728 --> 26:37.363
- THAT'S WHAT GERTRUDE STEIN
SAID TO PICASSO

26:37.396 --> 26:38.698
ABOUT HER PORTRAIT.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.266
YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID?
- HMM.

26:40.299 --> 26:43.135
- IT WILL.
[both laugh]

26:45.071 --> 26:46.773
IT'S GOOD.
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

26:46.806 --> 26:49.375
IF I WEREN'T ME,
I'D BE JEALOUS.

26:49.408 --> 26:51.878
- YOU WERE THE INSPIRATION.

26:51.911 --> 26:53.112
- YOU KNOW, IF YOU WEREN'T
A FUCKING DYKE,

26:53.145 --> 26:54.313
I'D ASK YOU TO MARRY ME.

26:54.346 --> 26:55.915
- OH, IS THAT HOW IT WORKS?
- YEAH.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.383
- YOU PROPOSE TO ANY WOMAN
WHO FLATTERS YOU?

26:57.416 --> 26:59.318
- GENERALLY SPEAKING
AND WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS.

26:59.351 --> 27:03.289
- WELL, IF I WEREN'T ALREADY
MARRIED, I MIGHT JUST ACCEPT.

27:19.939 --> 27:23.810
- BRIAN.

27:23.843 --> 27:27.780
BRIAN!

27:27.814 --> 27:30.316
BRIAN?

27:33.119 --> 27:35.755
JESUS, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

27:35.788 --> 27:37.790
- CHERNOBYL.

27:40.259 --> 27:42.161
- CHRIST, YOU SHOULD BE IN BED.

27:42.194 --> 27:44.196
- WELL, I WAS, BUT...

27:44.230 --> 27:49.035
SOMEONE KEPT KNOCK, KNOCK,
KNOCKING AT MY FUCKING DOOR.

27:49.068 --> 27:52.705
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I'M MAKING SOME CHICKEN SOUP.

27:54.340 --> 27:56.943
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE
BUT BEER AND POPPERS.

27:56.976 --> 27:58.945
- ALL THE ESSENTIALS.

27:58.978 --> 28:01.748
- WELL, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO STOCK UP ON GROCERIES.

28:01.781 --> 28:03.449
- MICHAEL.
- AS LONG AS I'M HERE,

28:03.482 --> 28:06.252
I CAN DO YOUR LAUNDRY.
- MICHAEL!

28:06.285 --> 28:08.921
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY
I DID NOT WANT ANYONE TO KNOW.

28:08.955 --> 28:11.323
IT'S WHY I TOLD EVERYONE
I WENT TO IBIZA,

28:11.357 --> 28:13.926
IN THE HOPES THAT I WOULDN'T
BE TREATED LIKE AN INVALID

28:13.960 --> 28:16.729
OR A VICTIM
OR LIKE I WAS GONNA DIE.

28:16.763 --> 28:19.698
NOW, WOULD YOU GET OUT OF HERE?

28:42.121 --> 28:44.356
WHAT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
ABOUT "FUCK OFF"?

28:44.390 --> 28:47.026
- YOU THINK YOU CAN KICK ME OUT
OF HERE THE WAY YOU DID JUSTIN?

28:47.059 --> 28:49.829
AND FOR WHAT--TRYING NOT
TO LET ON THAT HE KNEW,

28:49.862 --> 28:51.497
BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY
YOU WANTED IT?

28:51.530 --> 28:54.834
HE DESERVES TO KNOW.
HE'S YOUR LOVER...

28:54.867 --> 28:59.371
YOUR PARTNER, WHETHER YOU WANT
TO ADMIT IT OR NOT.

28:59.405 --> 29:02.374
AND SICK OR NOT, THAT'S A
FUCKING SHITTY WAY TO TREAT HIM.

29:02.408 --> 29:05.111
- I WAS ONLY TRYING
TO MAKE IT EASIER.

29:05.144 --> 29:06.512
- BY NEVER SEEING HIM AGAIN?

29:06.545 --> 29:08.247
- HE WOULD'VE LEFT
SOONER OR LATER ANYWAY.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.316
MIGHT AS WELL BE SOONER.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING--

29:10.349 --> 29:12.852
- WOULD YOU JUST
GO HOME, MICHAEL?

29:12.885 --> 29:16.889
GO HOME TO YOUR WIFE
AND YOUR KID!

29:22.061 --> 29:26.032
[indistinct chatter]

29:30.502 --> 29:32.538
- HAVE I TOLD YOU
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU?

29:32.571 --> 29:34.540
- NOT FOR AT LEAST TEN MINUTES.

29:34.573 --> 29:36.142
- THEN I'D BETTER REMIND YOU.

29:36.175 --> 29:38.110
- EXCUSE ME.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.315
WHAT A FOOL I'VE BEEN.

29:43.349 --> 29:45.918
ALL THOSE SUNDAY AFTERNOONS
GOING TO TEA DANCES AT WOODY'S,

29:45.952 --> 29:47.920
WHEN I COULD'VE BEEN GOING
TO FOOTBALL GAMES INSTEAD.

29:47.954 --> 29:49.889
- THOSE IRON MEN
ARE DELECTABLE.

29:49.922 --> 29:52.892
- ALMOST AS DELECTABLE
AS YOUR CHERRIES JUBILEE.

29:52.925 --> 29:56.428
- WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE
THE ANNOUNCEMENT!

29:56.462 --> 29:58.898
- HERE WE GO.

29:58.931 --> 30:01.033
[humming tune]

30:01.067 --> 30:02.902
- CAN WE HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION, EVERYONE?

30:02.935 --> 30:05.437
DREW AND I HAVE
AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

30:05.471 --> 30:08.040
- AS YOU ALL KNOW,
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON

30:08.074 --> 30:11.911
WHO'S BETTER AT KICKING BALLS
THAN I AM, AND THAT'S SIERRA.

30:11.944 --> 30:13.579
[laughter]

30:13.612 --> 30:15.915
SO, AFTER THREATENING TO KICK
MINE OVER THE GOALPOST,

30:15.948 --> 30:17.183
I'VE FINALLY AGREED
TO MARRY HER.

30:17.216 --> 30:18.450
- WE'RE ENGAGED!

30:18.484 --> 30:22.354
[cheers and applause]

30:24.290 --> 30:27.093
- HEY, BROTHER.
- CONGRATULATIONS.

30:27.126 --> 30:28.527
WAY TO GO, MAN.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.963
- HEY, DREW, WHERE'D YOU
GET THOSE CATERERS?

30:30.997 --> 30:33.065
- LOOKS LIKE A COUPLE
OF FLAMERS TO ME.

30:33.099 --> 30:36.969
[laughter, indistinct chatter]

30:44.643 --> 30:49.215
- EXCUSE ME, MR. BOYD.

30:49.248 --> 30:52.218
I HOPE I'M NOT, UH,
OUT OF PLACE FOR SAYING THIS.

30:52.251 --> 30:54.954
ACTUALLY,
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK IF I AM.

30:54.987 --> 30:58.090
BACK IN HAZELHURST, UH,
MISSISSIPPI, WHERE I GREW UP,

30:58.124 --> 31:00.893
I WAS ALWAYS TAUGHT
THAT IF A REAL MAN

31:00.927 --> 31:02.561
HAS SOMETHING TO SAY
ABOUT SOMEONE,

31:02.594 --> 31:05.497
HE SAYS IT TO HIS FACE,
NOT BEHIND HIS BACK.

31:05.531 --> 31:08.968
SO, EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY BE
A-A STAR,

31:09.001 --> 31:11.437
YOU KNOW, CAPTAIN OF THE TEAM,
HERO TO MILLIONS,

31:11.470 --> 31:15.407
YOU STILL HAVE A LOT TO LEARN
ABOUT BEING A MAN.

31:23.615 --> 31:26.919
FLAMING CHERRIES JUBILEE?
- OH, THANK YOU.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.990
- IT LOOKS LIKE
SOMEONE'S OPENED IT.

31:31.023 --> 31:33.259
- REALLY? IT MUST'VE BEEN
ONE OF THE NEIGHBORS.

31:33.292 --> 31:34.660
THEY'RE ALWAYS SNOOPING.

31:34.693 --> 31:37.930
- [scoffs]

31:46.238 --> 31:48.540
- THEY REJECTED IT.
- WE KNOW!

31:48.574 --> 31:51.177
I MEAN, THAT TOTALLY SUCKS.

31:53.645 --> 31:55.414
- I'M SORRY, BEN.

31:55.447 --> 31:58.717
- [scoffs]

31:58.750 --> 32:02.021
WELL, I GUESS THAT'S THAT.

32:02.054 --> 32:04.090
- DIDN'T SOME FAMOUS WRITER,

32:04.123 --> 32:06.592
LIKE ERNEST HEMINGWAY
OR STEPHEN KING,

32:06.625 --> 32:08.961
SEND THEIR BOOK
TO 24 PUBLISHERS

32:08.995 --> 32:11.563
BEFORE SOMEONE
FINALLY ACCEPTED IT?

32:11.597 --> 32:15.467
- THIS WAS THE 25TH.

32:15.501 --> 32:18.070
- STILL,
YOU'RE A WONDERFUL WRITER.

32:18.104 --> 32:21.440
AND YOU HAVE A MILLION STORIES
INSIDE YOU,

32:21.473 --> 32:25.577
AND THAT'S WHY I GOT YOU
SOMETHING TO HELP YOU TELL THEM.

32:25.611 --> 32:26.712
- WHAT'S THAT?

32:26.745 --> 32:28.114
- IT'S CALLED A COMPUTER.

32:28.147 --> 32:29.448
- YOU SAID YOU NEEDED A NEW ONE.

32:29.481 --> 32:31.117
- I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU COULD AFFORD

32:31.150 --> 32:33.085
SOMETHING
THIS EXTRAVAGANT.

32:33.119 --> 32:34.653
- IT WAS ME.
I PAID FOR IT.

32:34.686 --> 32:38.657
I'VE BEEN MOONLIGHTING--
- SHUT UP.

32:38.690 --> 32:42.261
I GOT A CHECK TODAY FROM...

32:42.294 --> 32:44.196
HOLLYWOOD.

32:44.230 --> 32:47.466
- SO YOU READ MY MAIL,

32:47.499 --> 32:49.668
FIGURED YOU'D BETTER DO
SOMETHING TO CHEER ME UP,

32:49.701 --> 32:52.004
AND WENT OUT
AND BOUGHT ME A COMPUTER?

32:52.038 --> 32:55.007
- THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
THE PLOT IN A NUTSHELL.

32:55.041 --> 32:57.709
- WELL, I DON'T WANT YOUR
CONSOLATION PRIZE OR YOUR PITY.

33:00.246 --> 33:01.413
- BEN.

33:06.118 --> 33:08.087
- SO, UH...

33:08.120 --> 33:11.057
DOES THIS MEAN
I GET THE COMPUTER?

33:18.330 --> 33:20.399
- ON THE HOUSE.

33:20.432 --> 33:23.502
- NICE TO SEE YOU
BACK ON THE JOB.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.771
- AS LIBERTY AVENUE'S
LEADING FAG HAG?

33:25.804 --> 33:28.540
- ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES.

33:28.574 --> 33:30.109
COSMO, PLEASE.

33:30.142 --> 33:32.778
- SO HOW WAS YOUR PARTY?
DID DARREN WORK OUT?

33:32.811 --> 33:34.813
- KID'S GOT QUITE A RANGE--

33:34.846 --> 33:36.782
KITSCH TO KITCHEN.

33:36.815 --> 33:40.252
AS FOR ME,
IT WAS MY USUAL TRIUMPH...

33:40.286 --> 33:41.553
EXCEPT FOR THE HOST--

33:41.587 --> 33:44.523
SOME MACHO ASSHOLE,
PLAYS FOR THE IRON MEN.

33:44.556 --> 33:46.325
HALFBACK...

33:46.358 --> 33:47.793
QUARTERBACK...

33:47.826 --> 33:49.528
"THIRDBACK."

33:49.561 --> 33:53.265
- YEAH, STRAIGHT GUYS--
YOU CAN KEEP 'EM.

33:53.299 --> 33:55.401
NO, THANKS.

33:55.434 --> 33:58.270
ALTHOUGH THERE
IS A CERTAIN DETECTIVE

33:58.304 --> 34:00.306
I'D HOLD ON TO,
IF I WERE YOU.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.408
- REFILL, PLEASE.

34:02.441 --> 34:04.476
- DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID?

34:04.510 --> 34:08.414
- JUST WHEN YOU HAND THEM
YOUR HEART, THEY GO AND...

34:08.447 --> 34:11.417
[pops lips]
DROP-KICK IT.

34:11.450 --> 34:15.354
- HIDDEN IN THE FOOTBALL
METAPHOR IS A SECRET CLUE.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.588
UH...

34:16.622 --> 34:19.425
I SUSPECT TO ANOTHER WOMAN?

34:19.458 --> 34:22.394
- HMM.
DAMN, YOU'RE GOOD.

34:24.663 --> 34:27.599
IT'S LIKE OLIVER MARCONI
ALL OVER AGAIN.

34:29.868 --> 34:32.838
HE WAS A SWEET BOY.

34:32.871 --> 34:35.507
HE LIVED NEXT DOOR TO US
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP.

34:35.541 --> 34:39.178
AND HE HAD A HUGE CRUSH ON ME.

34:39.211 --> 34:40.712
OF COURSE,
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS ALIVE

34:40.746 --> 34:43.849
UNTIL HE AND HIS FAMILY
MOVED AWAY.

34:43.882 --> 34:47.519
I STARTED ACHING FOR HIM.

34:47.553 --> 34:49.655
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE.

34:52.491 --> 34:55.761
IT'S FUNNY, I-I STILL HOLD
A PIECE OF MY HEART FOR HIM...

34:57.496 --> 35:00.332
SAME AS I DO FOR CARL.

35:00.366 --> 35:01.733
- SO HE'S DATING.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.335
SO WHAT?

35:03.369 --> 35:04.770
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.272
HELL, DATING IN THIS PLACE

35:06.305 --> 35:07.873
JUST MEANS YOU SUCKED
SOME GUY'S DICK

35:07.906 --> 35:11.510
AND WENT OUT FOR COFFEE.

35:11.543 --> 35:15.914
- WELL, UNLESS THERE'S SOMETHING
HE'S NOT TELLING ME...

35:15.947 --> 35:19.218
THIS CHICK AIN'T GOT A DICK.

35:19.251 --> 35:22.888
AND IT'S MORE
THAN A CUP OF JOE.

35:22.921 --> 35:26.692
HE'S GONE, EM.

35:26.725 --> 35:30.629
I LOST HIM.

35:30.662 --> 35:33.799
[rhythmic breathing]

35:33.832 --> 35:35.801
- BEAUTIFUL.

35:38.837 --> 35:42.274
GOOD.

35:42.308 --> 35:44.676
EXCELLENT.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.245
HEY.

35:46.278 --> 35:47.579
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

35:47.613 --> 35:49.415
WHY AREN'T YOU BREATHING?

35:49.448 --> 35:51.583
- ME?

35:51.617 --> 35:53.652
- THIS IS A TEAM EFFORT.

35:53.685 --> 35:57.589
YOUR RHYTHM HELPS MAINTAIN
HER RHYTHM, HMM?

35:57.623 --> 36:00.192
RIGHT.
- MM.

36:01.893 --> 36:03.395
MY RHYTHM?

36:03.429 --> 36:04.863
WHO DOES SHE THINK I AM--
B.B. KING?

36:04.896 --> 36:06.732
- SHE PROBABLY THINKS
YOU'RE MY HUSBAND

36:06.765 --> 36:09.768
AND WE'RE THIS CUTE
MARRIED COUPLE, LIKE THEM.

36:11.737 --> 36:13.539
- I'D SAY WE'RE CUTER.

36:13.572 --> 36:15.607
- WOULDN'T SHE BE SURPRISED
TO KNOW THE TRUTH?

36:15.641 --> 36:16.975
- MAYBE NOT.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.544
MAYBE SHE'D JUST THINK,

36:18.577 --> 36:22.414
"HOW SWEET," OR,
"ISN'T THAT INTERESTING?"

36:22.448 --> 36:25.551
BETTER YET,
MAYBE SHE WOULDN'T CARE AT ALL.

36:25.584 --> 36:28.820
- I THINK IT'S AMAZING,
HOW FAR WE'VE COME--

36:28.854 --> 36:31.557
YOU AND BEN, ME AND LINDSAY.

36:31.590 --> 36:34.826
I'D SAY WE'RE FUCKING LUCKY
TO HAVE SUCH STABLE HOME LIVES,

36:34.860 --> 36:38.297
WONDERFUL MATES
WHOM WE LOVE AND WHO LOVE US,

36:38.330 --> 36:41.233
ONE BEAUTIFUL CHILD
AND ANOTHER ONE ON THE WAY--

36:41.267 --> 36:43.302
BRIGHT FUTURES ALL AROUND.

36:43.335 --> 36:46.338
- BRIGHT FUTURES ALL AROUND.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.479
HEY.

36:53.512 --> 36:55.013
I WAS JUST AT LAMAZE CLASS
WITH MEL.

36:55.046 --> 36:56.982
- I CAME FOR THE CHECK.

36:57.015 --> 37:00.652
- OH, RIGHT.

37:00.686 --> 37:03.989
I WAS GOING TO DROP IT OFF.

37:04.022 --> 37:05.857
- THANKS.

37:05.891 --> 37:07.025
- HEY, WAIT UP.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.527
- WHAT FOR?

37:08.560 --> 37:10.396
- I SAW BRIAN LAST NIGHT.

37:10.429 --> 37:11.897
- LUCKY YOU.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.465
- HE LOOKED LIKE SHIT.

37:13.499 --> 37:15.467
FELT SO BAD,
HE COULD HARDLY GET OUT OF BED.

37:15.501 --> 37:16.868
- I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT,

37:16.902 --> 37:18.770
BUT IT REALLY
DOESN'T CONCERN ME ANYMORE.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.539
- THAT'S BULLSHIT.

37:20.572 --> 37:21.940
- HE FUCKING KICKED ME OUT.

37:21.973 --> 37:23.609
HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT
TO SEE ME AGAIN.

37:23.642 --> 37:27.012
- MORE LIKE HE DOESN'T WANT YOU
TO SEE HIM.

37:27.045 --> 37:29.481
YOU'VE READ
THE KINNEY OPERATING MANUAL.

37:29.515 --> 37:32.484
HE THINKS NOW THAT HE'S SICK
THAT HE'S NO LONGER PERFECT,

37:32.518 --> 37:35.654
THAT YOU WON'T LOVE HIM
ANYMORE,

37:35.687 --> 37:38.023
THAT YOU'RE GOING
TO LEAVE HIM.

37:38.056 --> 37:40.359
- THAT'S CRAZY, EVEN FOR HIM.

37:40.392 --> 37:43.662
- NOT IF YOU PUT ALL YOUR EGGS
IN ONE BASKET, SO TO SPEAK.

37:43.695 --> 37:47.366
WHEN--WHEN BEING YOUNG,
BEING BEAUTIFUL,

37:47.399 --> 37:49.501
BEING BRIAN KINNEY
IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT,

37:49.535 --> 37:52.438
YOU TAKE THAT AWAY,
HE FIGURES, WHAT'S HE GOT?

38:00.346 --> 38:02.981
[footsteps]

38:03.014 --> 38:05.384
- THAT NEEDS TO GO OVER THERE,

38:05.417 --> 38:07.953
AND I THINK WE NEED
A LARGER PIECE FOR THAT SPACE.

38:07.986 --> 38:09.988
- HEY, KIDS,
LET'S PUT ON A SHOW.

38:10.021 --> 38:11.923
- YOU WANT TO GIVE ME
A HAND HERE?

38:11.957 --> 38:13.792
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

38:13.825 --> 38:15.827
I DIDN'T WANT YOU SEEING
ANYTHING UNTIL IT'S FINISHED.

38:15.861 --> 38:17.663
- I'M SURE IT'LL BE JUST DUCKY.
- "DUCKY"?

38:17.696 --> 38:19.398
THIS MAY BE
SMALL POTATOES TO YOU,

38:19.431 --> 38:20.932
CONSIDERING YOU'VE HAD SHOWS

38:20.966 --> 38:22.801
AT EVERY MAJOR GALLERY
AND MUSEUM ALL OVER THE WORLD,

38:22.834 --> 38:24.703
BUT TO US YOKELS
HERE IN PITTSBURGH,

38:24.736 --> 38:26.805
THIS IS A BIG DEAL.
- DID I SAY ANYTHING?

38:26.838 --> 38:30.342
- [sighs] I JUST WANT
EVERYTHING TO BE PERFECT...

38:30.376 --> 38:33.111
DO RIGHT BY YOU AND YOUR WORK.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.414
- YOU WILL, KIDDO.
YOU'RE WORLD-CLASS.

38:35.447 --> 38:37.416
- I AM?

38:37.449 --> 38:40.419
- IN FACT, IT REMINDS ME OF
MY LAST RETROSPECTIVE IN VENICE.

38:40.452 --> 38:41.953
- HEY, SIR.
- GOT IT.

38:41.987 --> 38:43.889
- COULDN'T FIND A FUCKING
ASHTRAY THERE EITHER.

38:43.922 --> 38:45.691
HEADS UP!

38:45.724 --> 38:48.326
OH.
THAT WAS A CLOSE CALL.

38:55.467 --> 38:57.436
- IT WASN'T THAT BAD.

38:57.469 --> 39:00.038
- THEN WHY ARE YOU SHAKING?

39:20.492 --> 39:22.494
- WRITING?

39:22.528 --> 39:25.464
- PREPARING A LECTURE.

39:25.497 --> 39:29.000
- [sighs]
HOW ABOUT I ORDER A PIZZA?

39:29.034 --> 39:32.471
- UH, NOT HUNGRY.

39:32.504 --> 39:34.473
- HOW ABOUT YOU HANDCUFF ME
TO THE BED--

39:34.506 --> 39:36.742
- MICHAEL,
CAN'T YOU SEE I'M WORKING?

39:36.775 --> 39:38.910
- YES, NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,
I CAN.

39:38.944 --> 39:41.747
I CAN ALSO SEE THE NEW COMPUTER
I GOT YOU, SITTING ALONE,

39:41.780 --> 39:44.616
IGNORED, LIKE SOME GEEKY GUY
AT THE PROM.

39:44.650 --> 39:46.084
- JESUS.

39:46.117 --> 39:48.520
- LOOK, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH.

39:48.554 --> 39:49.955
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

39:49.988 --> 39:51.757
I'VE HAD MORE THAN MY FAIR SHARE
OF REJECTIONS,

39:51.790 --> 39:54.092
LIKE, BY PRACTICALLY EVERY CLUB,
EVERY COLLEGE,

39:54.125 --> 39:55.894
EVERY JOB
I EVER WENT UP FOR.

39:55.927 --> 39:58.897
- BUT YOU'RE BEING ACCEPTED NOW.
THAT'S ALL THAT COUNTS.

39:58.930 --> 40:00.632
- BUT I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO BLAME ME

40:00.666 --> 40:02.534
OR MAKE ME FEEL LIKE
IT'S MY FAULT.

40:02.568 --> 40:03.969
- I'M SORRY IF I DID THAT.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.772
I HAVE NO ONE TO CREDIT
FOR MY FAILURE BUT MYSELF,

40:06.805 --> 40:11.042
WHICH IS WHY I'VE DECIDED
TO REEVALUATE MY GOALS.

40:11.076 --> 40:15.113
UM, REFOCUS MY ENERGY
AND...

40:15.146 --> 40:17.048
STOP WRITING...

40:17.082 --> 40:20.185
AT LEAST FOR A WHILE.

40:20.218 --> 40:22.454
I-I FEEL I SHOULD START
CONCENTRATING MY EFFORTS

40:22.488 --> 40:25.123
ON WHAT I DO BEST,
WHICH IS TO TEACH.

40:25.156 --> 40:26.958
IT'S WHERE MY SKILLS ARE.

40:26.992 --> 40:28.927
IT'S WHERE MY LIFE
IS LEADING ME.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.997
- BEN, THE--
- OOH, IN FACT, I...

40:32.030 --> 40:35.601
GOT TO GO TO MY OFFICE.
- NOW?

40:35.634 --> 40:40.539
- I LEFT SOME REFERENCE BOOKS
I NEED FOR MY LECTURE...

40:40.572 --> 40:42.741
AND A PILE OF TERM PAPERS.

40:42.774 --> 40:46.712
- WELL, WHEN WILL YOU BE BACK?
- DON'T KNOW.

40:50.716 --> 40:54.119
I'M SURE YOU CAN RETURN IT
AND GET YOUR MONEY BACK.

41:00.125 --> 41:02.193
[door closes]

41:08.066 --> 41:09.568
- IS SIERRA IN?

41:09.601 --> 41:11.002
- SHE'S OFF
WITH HER GIRLFRIENDS,

41:11.036 --> 41:14.139
SEEING SOME CHICK FLICK.
- OH.

41:14.172 --> 41:17.976
WELL, I STOPPED BY TO PICK UP
A CHECK AND MY EQUIPMENT.

41:18.009 --> 41:21.046
- YEAH, SHE LEFT YOU A CHECK.
COME IN.

41:24.149 --> 41:25.951
WELL?

41:36.662 --> 41:39.130
HERE YOU GO.

41:39.164 --> 41:40.599
- THANKS.

41:40.632 --> 41:42.734
I'LL JUST GET
MY EQUIPMENT AND--

41:42.768 --> 41:45.571
- HOW ABOUT A BEER?

41:48.640 --> 41:52.277
[bottles clinking]

41:52.310 --> 41:53.879
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE DRINKING,

41:53.912 --> 41:56.615
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I'M IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE,

41:56.648 --> 42:00.552
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

42:00.586 --> 42:04.055
- I'D SAY ONE BEER IS NOT GOING
TO RUIN THAT SIX-PACK.

42:08.059 --> 42:10.195
- OH, THAT'S LAST WEEK'S GAME.

42:10.228 --> 42:13.198
COACH MAKES US
WATCH OURSELVES.

42:15.233 --> 42:18.770
- WHICH ONE ARE YOU?
- NUMBER SEVEN.

42:18.804 --> 42:21.539
- VERY GRACEFUL...

42:23.108 --> 42:25.310
IN A RUGGED, MANLY WAY.

42:25.343 --> 42:29.180
- [chuckles]

42:29.214 --> 42:31.316
- YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO ASK.

42:31.349 --> 42:33.184
WHY THE TIGHT PANTS?

42:33.218 --> 42:35.921
- SO THERE'S NOTHING TO GRAB
ONTO IF YOU'RE TACKLED.

42:35.954 --> 42:40.191
- AND WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS
PATTING EACH OTHER'S ASSES?

42:40.225 --> 42:42.661
- JUST FRIENDLY ENCOURAGEMENT.

42:42.694 --> 42:46.064
- YOU KNOW,
I DON'T SEE MUCH DIFFERENCE

42:46.097 --> 42:48.366
IN HOW YOU PLAY YOUR GAME
ON SUNDAY AFTERNOONS

42:48.399 --> 42:51.970
AND HOW I PLAY MY GAME
ON SATURDAY NIGHTS.

42:54.973 --> 42:57.743
- HERE...

42:57.776 --> 42:59.344
CATCH.

42:59.377 --> 43:00.946
- OH, MY GOD!
[chuckles]

43:00.979 --> 43:02.013
DID YOU SEE THAT?

43:02.047 --> 43:03.381
I CAUGHT IT.

43:03.414 --> 43:06.217
NEVER CAUGHT A BALL
IN MY LIFE.

43:06.251 --> 43:08.987
OH!

43:11.657 --> 43:13.258
- YOU OKAY?

43:13.291 --> 43:17.729
- THIS ALSO ISN'T MUCH DIFFERENT
THAN MY SATURDAY NIGHTS.

43:21.199 --> 43:25.704
YOU HAVE A-A VERY NICE BODY.

43:25.737 --> 43:28.840
- YOU THINK SO?

43:28.874 --> 43:31.843
- STRONG, UH...

43:31.877 --> 43:32.844
HARD.

43:32.878 --> 43:35.246
- FEEL MY BICEP.

43:35.280 --> 43:37.615
GO ON.

43:43.755 --> 43:45.924
NOW FEEL THIS.

43:48.293 --> 43:50.729
- WHAT ABOUT SIERRA?

43:50.762 --> 43:53.699
- SHE THINKS
I HAVE A NICE BODY TOO.

43:55.767 --> 43:59.237
[shuddering]

44:01.306 --> 44:03.041
[knock at door]

44:03.074 --> 44:04.943
- I WAS WORKING LATE
AND FIGURED YOU MIGHT BE TOO,

44:04.976 --> 44:06.411
SO I TOOK A CHANCE
AND STOPPED BY.

44:06.444 --> 44:08.013
- WELL, YOU FIGURED RIGHT...

44:08.046 --> 44:10.749
EXCEPT, AS YOU CAN SEE,
I'M A LITTLE BUSY

44:10.782 --> 44:12.784
DOING RESEARCH
FOR THIS LECTURE.

44:12.818 --> 44:14.185
- THEN I WON'T KEEP YOU.

44:14.219 --> 44:17.222
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU
I READ YOUR BOOK.

44:17.255 --> 44:20.759
- ALREADY?
THAT WAS FAST.

44:20.792 --> 44:22.894
- IT'S LIKE I MISSED
THE LAST 36 HOURS.

44:22.928 --> 44:24.830
I WAS SO ENTHRALLED,
I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.

44:24.863 --> 44:27.032
- THAT'S A FIRST. MOST PEOPLE
COULD BARELY PICK IT UP.

44:27.065 --> 44:29.434
- [laughs]
WHAT THE FUCK DO THEY KNOW?

44:29.467 --> 44:32.804
- I'D LIKE TO THINK NOT MUCH.
- EXACTLY.

44:35.941 --> 44:37.809
- THANK YOU, ANTHONY.

44:37.843 --> 44:40.712
- NO, UH, THANK YOU

44:40.746 --> 44:42.948
FOR...

44:42.981 --> 44:44.983
ENTRUSTING ME WITH IT.

44:51.489 --> 44:52.991
WHEN YOU HAVE A SPARE MOMENT,

44:53.024 --> 44:55.861
MAYBE WE CAN GO
FOR COFFEE AGAIN, DISCUSS IT.

44:55.894 --> 44:58.363
- RIGHT.

45:02.834 --> 45:06.471
ANTHONY...

45:06.504 --> 45:10.108
ACTUALLY, I HAVE A MOMENT NOW.

45:11.843 --> 45:15.280
- [groans]

45:15.313 --> 45:18.917
[coughs, clears throat]

45:26.157 --> 45:28.827
- BRI?
DANDY LUBE JUST CALLED.

45:28.860 --> 45:30.428
WE GOT 'EM.

45:30.461 --> 45:33.231
- WAY TO GO, THEODORE.

45:33.264 --> 45:35.266
YEAH, I TOLD YOU
YOU COULD DO IT.

45:35.300 --> 45:38.303
- YEAH, IT WAS A LITTLE DICEY
AT FIRST, BUT, UH...

45:38.336 --> 45:41.372
[sniffs] YEAH, I MANAGED
TO CONVINCE THEM.

45:41.406 --> 45:45.110
- HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

45:45.143 --> 45:49.180
- I JUST THOUGHT TO MYSELF,
"WHAT WOULD BRIAN KINNEY DO?"

45:49.214 --> 45:53.018
AFTER THAT, IT WAS A SNAP.

45:53.051 --> 45:57.255
YOU KNOW,
YOU DON'T LOOK SO HOT.

45:57.288 --> 45:59.157
WHY DON'T YOU--

45:59.190 --> 46:01.993
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME, UH,
MIND THE SHOP AND YOU GO HOME,

46:02.027 --> 46:04.295
HMM?

46:19.044 --> 46:21.980
[keys jingling]

46:36.962 --> 46:39.064
- I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO GET OUT.

46:39.097 --> 46:43.902
- I GUESS I DIDN'T HEAR.
YOU TEND TO MUMBLE A LOT.

46:43.935 --> 46:47.438
YOU WANT SOME SOUP?
IT'S DEBBIE'S HOMEMADE RECIPE.

46:47.472 --> 46:49.474
- WELL, NO WONDER
I FEEL LIKE BARFING.

46:49.507 --> 46:52.177
LISTEN TO ME,
YOU LITTLE SHIT.

46:52.210 --> 46:55.480
I DON'T WANT YOU HERE.

46:55.513 --> 46:57.515
- I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU WANT.

47:02.087 --> 47:04.589
[pot lid rattling]

47:04.622 --> 47:07.525
YOU'RE NOT GETTING RID OF ME.

47:07.558 --> 47:10.461
- [groans]

47:10.495 --> 47:13.064
- SHIT.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

47:13.098 --> 47:15.600
TELL ME YOU'RE--
- I'M ALL RIGHT!

47:15.633 --> 47:17.135
- YOU'RE NOT ALL RIGHT.

47:17.168 --> 47:19.470
- THEN WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU ASKING ME FOR?

47:19.504 --> 47:21.006
- SO THAT I CAN TELL YOU

47:21.039 --> 47:22.340
WHAT A MOTHERFUCKING
PIECE OF SHIT YOU ARE

47:22.373 --> 47:24.943
FOR NOT TELLING ME,
FOR SHUTTING ME OUT,

47:24.976 --> 47:27.112
FOR THINKING THAT YOU COULD
HANDLE THIS ON YOUR OWN,

47:27.145 --> 47:29.981
AND, MOST OF ALL, FOR THINKING
I WOULD LEAVE YOU.

47:30.015 --> 47:33.384
WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT--
BECAUSE YOU HAD A BALL REMOVED?

47:33.418 --> 47:35.420
BECAUSE YOU'RE
NO LONGER PERFECT?

47:35.453 --> 47:37.088
WELL, BELIEVE ME, MR. KINNEY,

47:37.122 --> 47:39.390
THAT IS THE LEAST
OF YOUR IMPERFECTIONS.

47:39.424 --> 47:40.992
AND IF I'D WANTED
TO LEAVE YOU,

47:41.026 --> 47:43.261
I'VE HAD BETTER REASONS--
PLENTY OF THEM.

47:43.294 --> 47:45.296
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE.

47:45.330 --> 47:48.233
- YEAH, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

47:48.266 --> 47:50.268
BUT I THOUGHT
WE HAD A COMMITMENT.

47:50.301 --> 47:52.403
AND I PLAN TO STAND BY IT.

47:54.405 --> 47:56.141
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU TO GET
YOUR ASS BACK IN BED,

47:56.174 --> 48:00.345
YOU SON OF A BITCH, AND EAT
SOME FUCKING CHICKEN SOUP?

48:11.322 --> 48:14.559
- [groans]

48:23.701 --> 48:28.273
- * WELL, I GOT NO PLACE

48:28.306 --> 48:33.311
* TO LAY DOWN MY HEAD

48:33.344 --> 48:37.682
* RAN OUT OF TIME

48:37.715 --> 48:43.021
* I'M ALL OUT OF TIME

48:43.054 --> 48:47.325
* WELL, I GOT NO PLACE

48:47.358 --> 48:52.330

48:56.734 --> 49:01.172
* I'M ALL OUT OF TIME

49:01.206 --> 49:06.511
* I NEED YOU,
I NEED YOU TO FIND ME HERE *

49:06.544 --> 49:10.348
* COME RESCUE ME

49:10.381 --> 49:16.187
* AND TAKE ME,
AND TAKE ME SO FAR AWAY *

49:16.221 --> 49:19.724
* COME RESCUE ME

49:19.757 --> 49:22.193
* JUST ONCE OR TWICE

49:22.227 --> 49:26.364
* GOT TO TAKE MY OWN ADVICE

49:26.397 --> 49:29.200
*

49:29.234 --> 49:31.736
* JUST ONCE OR TWICE

49:31.769 --> 49:35.740
* GOT TO TAKE MY OWN ADVICE

49:35.773 --> 49:40.078
*

49:40.111 --> 49:44.382
* WELL, I GOT NO PLACE

49:44.415 --> 49:49.387
* TO LAY DOWN MY HEAD

49:49.420 --> 49:54.092
* RAN OUT OF TIME

49:54.125 --> 49:59.097
* I'M ALL OUT OF TIME

49:59.130 --> 50:03.401
* WELL, I GOT NO PLACE

50:03.434 --> 50:08.406
* TO LAY DOWN MY HEAD

50:08.439 --> 50:13.111
* RAN OUT OF TIME

50:13.144 --> 50:17.582
* I'M ALL OUT OF TIME

50:17.615 --> 50:25.556
*
