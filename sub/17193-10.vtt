00:06.037 --> 00:08.905
What, exactly, do we suspect
Detective Maguire of doing?

00:08.907 --> 00:10.707
You step in, play the husband,

00:10.709 --> 00:13.070
then you bed my wife, make her pregnant,

00:13.071 --> 00:14.711
and then take her to the abortion doctor!

00:14.713 --> 00:16.413
Kill me now.

00:16.415 --> 00:17.881
I killed my own daughter.

01:07.471 --> 01:09.338
the confederates are
making a second attempt.

01:09.340 --> 01:11.674
This morning, they're smuggling in

01:11.676 --> 01:13.676
enough Greek Fire to devastate the city.

01:13.678 --> 01:15.578
I'm going to meet Kennedy and his men.

01:15.580 --> 01:16.912
You round up your boys.

01:16.914 --> 01:18.434
There's something I have to do, first.

01:18.435 --> 01:20.216
Whatever it is, there's no time.

01:20.218 --> 01:21.617
All I need's a minute.

01:21.619 --> 01:24.487
A minute we don't have.

01:26.657 --> 01:27.657
Ellen...

01:30.961 --> 01:34.397
of course.

01:38.101 --> 01:39.802
Delivery's at sunrise.

01:49.780 --> 01:51.547
Morning, detective!

01:51.549 --> 01:53.049
Don't know if this is a good time

01:53.051 --> 01:54.550
to visit the lady, sir.

01:54.552 --> 01:55.985
It's not a visit.

02:04.561 --> 02:05.995
Eva.

02:08.433 --> 02:09.899
Shit.

02:09.901 --> 02:11.600
I need a favor. Another favor.

02:11.602 --> 02:13.102
I know I don't have the right to ask.

02:13.104 --> 02:15.004
Ask, anyway.

02:15.006 --> 02:16.505
Go to my house,

02:16.507 --> 02:18.007
watch over Ellen.

02:18.009 --> 02:20.109
Again?

02:20.111 --> 02:21.610
After you chased me out?

02:21.612 --> 02:23.079
I don't know if I'll be back,

02:23.081 --> 02:26.549
or when.

02:26.551 --> 02:28.250
I just need someone I can trust

02:28.252 --> 02:29.752
to keep an eye.

02:29.754 --> 02:31.253
I wish you trusted someone else,

02:31.255 --> 02:32.755
every now and then.

02:34.459 --> 02:35.925
I'm trying to get some sleep, here.

02:35.927 --> 02:40.229
So shut up and go back to sleep.

02:40.231 --> 02:42.298
Jesus Christ.

02:50.474 --> 02:52.942
Friend!

02:52.944 --> 02:55.010
Kennedy instructed me to meet here.

02:55.012 --> 02:57.113
You that rich boy?

02:57.115 --> 02:59.548
In the flesh.

02:59.550 --> 03:01.083
Where is he?

03:01.085 --> 03:03.252
Don't know. Ain't shown up yet.

03:04.788 --> 03:06.889
Come on, bring it in.

03:06.891 --> 03:09.692
Tie the ropes off. Step up.

03:09.694 --> 03:11.460
Come on, we have

03:11.462 --> 03:13.629
a schedule to meet, let's go.

03:13.631 --> 03:18.000
Let's go. And careful
with that stuff.

03:18.002 --> 03:21.470
Damn it, Corky, where are you?

03:21.472 --> 03:23.105
Drop it! Down!

03:23.107 --> 03:25.107
Down! Get down!

03:25.109 --> 03:27.469
Drop 'em, you lousy graybacks!
Drop those goddamn weapons!

03:27.470 --> 03:30.646
Hands where I can see 'em.
Drop 'em.

03:30.648 --> 03:31.881
Down.

03:31.883 --> 03:33.783
Drop it, Reb.

03:33.785 --> 03:35.151
Good.

03:35.153 --> 03:37.553
Hey, Byrnes, we need live
prisoners, for information.

03:37.555 --> 03:39.235
Yeah? And what are
they going to tell us?

03:39.236 --> 03:41.590
Won't know if they're dead, Boyo.

03:41.592 --> 03:43.092
What's your name, son?

03:43.094 --> 03:45.494
Clem. Clem Cato.

03:45.496 --> 03:48.397
I'm a soldier with the confederate army.

03:48.399 --> 03:51.167
Well, Clem, welcome to enemy territory.

03:51.169 --> 03:54.170
Is this the full shipment?

03:54.172 --> 03:55.771
Appears so.

03:55.773 --> 03:58.307
It's identical to the last batch.

03:59.510 --> 04:00.743
Christ,

04:00.745 --> 04:04.046
a heap like that'll wake snakes.

04:04.048 --> 04:06.348
Kennedy never showed.

04:06.350 --> 04:10.019
Why would the man miss his own delivery?

04:10.021 --> 04:11.520
What's it matter?

04:11.522 --> 04:13.088
Without his junk, Kennedy's plan is

04:13.090 --> 04:15.057
dead as a wagon tire.

04:15.059 --> 04:17.026
There's no need to ship the stuff by boat,

04:17.028 --> 04:19.295
when we can make it right here.

04:19.297 --> 04:21.997
Our little show at Spuyten Duyvil

04:21.999 --> 04:24.934
should keep the authorities busy.

04:24.936 --> 04:29.038
I say...

04:29.040 --> 04:30.906
10,000 dead.

04:37.714 --> 04:41.717
She even lays there while she's awake,

04:41.719 --> 04:44.520
staring out into absolutely nothing,

04:44.522 --> 04:46.522
just twitching.

04:46.524 --> 04:48.023
The woman has peered

04:48.025 --> 04:49.725
through the gates of hell, Annie.

04:49.727 --> 04:52.461
I peered through those gates, too,

04:52.463 --> 04:55.297
but you don't see me laying around,

04:55.299 --> 04:57.766
acting all batty.

04:57.768 --> 04:59.902
You're a smart girl,

04:59.904 --> 05:02.071
so I'm going to speak honest to you.

05:02.073 --> 05:05.207
You have to stop the bullshit.

05:05.209 --> 05:07.610
You are a child.

05:07.612 --> 05:10.579
That is Kevin's wife

05:10.581 --> 05:12.381
and no amount of chicanery's

05:12.383 --> 05:14.950
going to change that.

05:14.952 --> 05:17.586
You've been dealt a tough hand,

05:17.588 --> 05:21.323
more than most, but you got a chance

05:21.325 --> 05:26.562
at a real life with folks who care.

05:26.564 --> 05:28.898
You keep going down this road,

05:28.900 --> 05:30.399
you'll find yourself alone.

05:37.574 --> 05:39.909
Keep moving, Reb.

05:39.911 --> 05:41.410
Keep your yankee hands off me!

05:41.412 --> 05:43.612
No sign of Kennedy at his hotel.

05:43.614 --> 05:46.649
He's probably on the
train back to Richmond.

05:46.651 --> 05:49.451
This all feel a bit too easy to you?

05:49.453 --> 05:51.053
Kennedy telling you the where and whens,

05:51.054 --> 05:52.534
these boys giving up without a fight,

05:52.535 --> 05:53.956
Kennedy's not being there.

05:53.958 --> 05:55.457
You'd have preferred a bloodbath?

05:55.459 --> 05:56.959
I'd have preferred not to feel

05:56.961 --> 05:58.460
this twist in the pit of my stomach.

05:58.462 --> 06:00.930
We captured a bunch of confederate spies,

06:00.932 --> 06:02.431
a whole slew of explosives.

06:02.433 --> 06:03.999
That's winning, Kevin.

06:04.001 --> 06:05.701
Smile, for once, enjoy it.

06:05.703 --> 06:07.269
Yeah, I suppose so.

06:07.271 --> 06:09.104
Smile all you want, you peglegged traitor.

06:09.106 --> 06:11.373
We still got friends
in this pisspot of a city.

06:11.375 --> 06:12.875
You tell 'em, boy!

06:12.877 --> 06:14.643
Y'all ain't won nothing!

06:14.645 --> 06:16.211
Long as Captain Kennedy walks free,

06:16.213 --> 06:17.980
the South lives!

06:19.950 --> 06:21.684
Get him on his goddamn knees.

06:21.686 --> 06:23.719
Perhaps there still is
some cause for concern.

06:23.721 --> 06:25.521
Come on, then!

06:30.927 --> 06:33.662
Any improvement?

06:33.664 --> 06:35.831
My head is swimming, my bones ache,

06:35.833 --> 06:37.800
I feel like I'm living
in somebody else's body.

06:37.802 --> 06:41.303
I'm wretched.

06:41.305 --> 06:43.172
An active baby

06:43.174 --> 06:45.274
can make you feel uncomfortable.

06:49.012 --> 06:50.512
And that's a good sign.

06:50.514 --> 06:54.583
A good sign for what?

06:54.585 --> 06:55.818
No.

06:55.820 --> 06:58.120
No, thank you.

06:58.122 --> 07:02.358
Now, Elizabeth, tell me true...

07:02.360 --> 07:05.260
do you love this man, Morehouse?

07:05.262 --> 07:06.862
Mr. Booth,

07:06.864 --> 07:08.764
I am not in the habit of discussing

07:08.766 --> 07:10.366
my personal affairs with an actor.

07:10.368 --> 07:11.867
I'm a star.

07:11.869 --> 07:13.369
Regardless.

07:15.339 --> 07:16.872
Did you love your husband?

07:16.874 --> 07:19.842
Winfred loved Winfred too much

07:19.844 --> 07:22.644
to share himself with me.

07:22.646 --> 07:24.780
If I'm expected to speak of such

07:24.782 --> 07:27.983
intimate feelings, then so must you.

07:27.985 --> 07:30.552
Are you not in love with Miss Lucy Hale?

07:33.423 --> 07:37.159
Yes, yes, I am in love
with Miss Lucy Hale,

07:37.161 --> 07:40.829
but her father is an abolitionist,

07:40.831 --> 07:42.865
part of Lincoln's cabal.

07:42.867 --> 07:44.833
A Juliet for your Romeo.

07:44.835 --> 07:47.703
Slavery is one of the great blessings

07:47.705 --> 07:51.273
that God has bestowed upon the black man.

07:51.275 --> 07:53.155
You know, Mr. Booth,
I find it remarkable that

07:53.156 --> 07:54.516
the South has gone to war, seeking

07:54.517 --> 07:56.979
their own independence, over the notion

07:56.981 --> 07:59.048
an entire race be denied their own.

08:03.686 --> 08:06.722
If you boys were back home,

08:06.724 --> 08:09.992
You'd be...
sipping Mint Juleps,

08:09.994 --> 08:14.596
bragging about how
you killed some Yankees.

08:14.598 --> 08:16.231
But you ain't back home.

08:16.233 --> 08:20.035
No, you're here, in New York City,

08:20.037 --> 08:21.537
where we like to kill traitors

08:21.539 --> 08:23.372
who murder real Americans.

08:23.374 --> 08:27.042
Detective Corcoran?

08:27.044 --> 08:29.044
He's got no love for turncoats.

08:29.046 --> 08:31.180
Fought at Gettysburg, he did,

08:31.182 --> 08:34.015
lost a lot of friends there.

08:34.018 --> 08:36.150
Far as he's concerned,

08:36.153 --> 08:40.589
each and every one of you

08:40.591 --> 08:42.390
deserves to die.

08:48.665 --> 08:50.165
Give me the next one, Andrew.

08:50.167 --> 08:52.367
Yeah, sure thing.

08:52.369 --> 08:53.368
You.

08:53.370 --> 08:55.337
Come on.

08:59.509 --> 09:01.910
Stop whining!

09:01.912 --> 09:04.246
So unless you boys feel
like telling the man

09:04.248 --> 09:05.881
what he wants to know...!

09:07.785 --> 09:09.284
It's your funeral.

09:13.923 --> 09:15.090
You.

09:15.092 --> 09:16.892
No, no no, no, no!

09:16.894 --> 09:18.127
Come on.

09:18.129 --> 09:19.628
No, no. Okay. No! I'll talk.

09:19.630 --> 09:21.270
I'll talk, I'll talk.
I'll tell you all.

09:21.271 --> 09:22.631
I ain't dying for Kennedy.

09:22.633 --> 09:24.133
Okay, spill it.
I know he's got some

09:24.135 --> 09:26.001
old highbrow New Yorker working for him.

09:26.003 --> 09:28.137
What's his name? I
don't know the name.

09:28.139 --> 09:29.638
Well, then, you ain't no good to us.

09:29.640 --> 09:31.480
Wait wait wait, hold on
a sec, hold on a sec.

09:31.481 --> 09:33.509
Kennedy's been bragging about how he's got

09:33.511 --> 09:35.544
this rich fella dancing like a jig doll.

09:35.546 --> 09:36.778
He's lying!

09:36.780 --> 09:38.280
Man lives at 23rd Street.

09:38.282 --> 09:39.615
Yeah, what else?

09:39.617 --> 09:41.049
The delivery at Spuyten Duyvil

09:41.051 --> 09:43.218
was all theatrics.

09:43.220 --> 09:44.953
Greek Fire's being made right here,

09:44.955 --> 09:46.722
Under your noses.

09:46.724 --> 09:48.357
Shut your mouth! And?

09:48.359 --> 09:50.626
I don't know, I swear.

09:50.628 --> 09:52.594
What do you say, Corky?

09:55.498 --> 09:57.933
I'd say that's all he knows.

09:57.935 --> 10:01.336
Very good, Reb. Now, shut up!

10:03.606 --> 10:05.374
You son of a...

10:05.376 --> 10:07.109
you would've, too!

10:07.111 --> 10:08.343
23rd Street?

10:08.345 --> 10:09.778
Apparently, my father is

10:09.780 --> 10:12.848
a bigger fool than I am.

10:12.850 --> 10:14.349
You would've done the same thing!

10:15.567 --> 10:17.735
Heavens, Annie, you Lulu.

10:21.007 --> 10:22.473
It feels good?

10:22.475 --> 10:25.743
"Good" doesn't describe it.

10:25.745 --> 10:29.546
You got yourself a gift, child.

10:31.950 --> 10:33.917
Hello, there, dear.

10:33.919 --> 10:36.920
Kevin asked if I would come over again

10:36.922 --> 10:38.656
and help out today.

10:38.658 --> 10:41.392
You mean, he wanted to make sure

10:41.394 --> 10:45.129
I didn't run off or hurt myself?

10:45.131 --> 10:48.666
Whatever the reason
may be. Join us.

10:54.072 --> 10:57.141
How do you feel?

10:57.143 --> 10:59.410
You up for some food?

10:59.412 --> 11:01.512
Annie can make you some oatmeal.

11:01.514 --> 11:03.013
She's a very good cook.

11:05.217 --> 11:07.685
Yes, and oatmeal's good medicine.

11:07.687 --> 11:08.919
All right.

11:14.559 --> 11:16.026
I brought some spring water.

11:21.900 --> 11:24.501
Imported from England.

11:24.503 --> 11:26.303
British kings and queens
have been drinking

11:26.305 --> 11:30.207
this stuff for centuries
to cure their ills.

11:30.209 --> 11:32.209
Coming over here again,

11:32.211 --> 11:36.113
caring for me and the child.

11:36.115 --> 11:39.550
Kevin's fortunate

11:39.552 --> 11:41.652
to have a friend like you.

11:44.190 --> 11:47.491
Yeah, I suppose.

11:52.029 --> 11:54.397
I need to stop by the Campbells'.

11:54.399 --> 11:56.999
Promised I'd check on Stephen.

11:57.001 --> 11:58.768
- The bitters aren't working.
- Matthew.

11:58.770 --> 12:00.670
I want some other cure.

12:00.672 --> 12:02.572
Well, there's only so much I can give you.

12:02.574 --> 12:05.708
How about some
raspberry-leaf tea?

12:05.710 --> 12:07.210
I don't want tea.

12:07.212 --> 12:09.846
I want medicine.
I want to feel better.

12:09.848 --> 12:11.347
I want to feel like myself.

12:11.349 --> 12:12.548
Sara.

12:12.550 --> 12:15.084
You don't understand what
this is like, Matthew.

12:15.086 --> 12:17.153
I can feel my body changing,

12:17.155 --> 12:20.056
the blood coursing under my skin,

12:20.058 --> 12:21.224
swelling.

12:21.226 --> 12:23.526
My mind is filled with
hundreds of thoughts

12:23.528 --> 12:25.027
popping in and out of my head,

12:25.029 --> 12:26.262
clouding everything.

12:26.264 --> 12:27.764
I don't know how I can do this.

12:27.766 --> 12:29.699
You are just overwhelmed.

12:29.701 --> 12:31.981
How can I raise a child, when
I abandoned my own mother?

12:31.982 --> 12:34.470
Now, you know that's not the truth!

12:34.472 --> 12:35.972
It might as well be.

12:35.974 --> 12:38.214
Your mother stayed behind
so that you and your brothers

12:38.215 --> 12:39.815
could escape, so that you could be free.

12:39.816 --> 12:41.444
She should be here with me!

12:41.446 --> 12:43.179
And if she was, she would tell you

12:43.181 --> 12:45.314
that what you are experiencing is natural!

12:45.316 --> 12:49.018
Your body is sustaining two lives now,

12:49.020 --> 12:52.054
which means a cold
can feel like the plague

12:52.056 --> 12:56.592
and a memory like a storm.

13:01.131 --> 13:03.933
I'll make you that tea.

13:03.935 --> 13:06.035
Yeah, the Campbells
can wait 'til tomorrow.

13:06.037 --> 13:08.638
No.

13:08.640 --> 13:11.474
You should go.

13:11.476 --> 13:12.975
I'm all right now.

13:12.977 --> 13:14.710
No, it's no problem.
I can stay.

13:14.712 --> 13:17.380
Go on.

13:17.382 --> 13:19.348
I'm fine.

13:19.350 --> 13:21.751
Storm's passed.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.556
I'll be back before you know it.

14:03.393 --> 14:05.561
Mr. Kennedy,

14:05.563 --> 14:07.063
while I've not been apprised

14:07.065 --> 14:08.531
of your specific targets,

14:08.533 --> 14:10.032
a proper supply of Oxygen is

14:10.034 --> 14:12.001
of the utmost, it's... it's...

14:12.003 --> 14:13.803
you've done the cause a fine service,

14:13.805 --> 14:15.805
doctor, truly.

14:32.923 --> 14:34.403
Father's been acting oddly ever since

14:34.404 --> 14:36.092
Kennedy approached him yesterday,

14:36.094 --> 14:38.327
but I assume Kennedy's actions

14:38.329 --> 14:39.829
were designed to provoke <i>me.</i>

14:39.831 --> 14:41.330
And if they weren't?

14:41.332 --> 14:42.832
Father makes it his business

14:42.834 --> 14:44.967
to play every possible angle, but this?

14:44.969 --> 14:47.603
There has to be another explanation.

14:47.605 --> 14:49.438
Adam, have you seen father today?

14:49.440 --> 14:50.940
No, sir, I haven't.

14:50.942 --> 14:53.276
Shit!

14:56.647 --> 14:58.147
As we speak,

14:58.149 --> 15:01.484
Kennedy, I fear, is somewhere in the city,

15:01.486 --> 15:03.586
with enough Greek Fire
to slaughter New York,

15:03.588 --> 15:05.454
just as we slaughtered Atlanta.

15:05.456 --> 15:08.691
I was never in Atlanta.

15:08.693 --> 15:12.295
What's the matter?

15:12.297 --> 15:14.964
What did that message say?

15:14.966 --> 15:16.832
It's nothing of importance.

15:16.834 --> 15:19.635
It's just some business
for Mr. Morehouse Senior.

15:19.637 --> 15:22.772
Are you certain of that?

15:22.774 --> 15:25.975
It's regarding the sale of some textiles.

15:25.977 --> 15:27.476
Corky, what is it?

15:30.981 --> 15:32.581
There were a few good things I took

15:32.583 --> 15:36.652
from time in the Union army, Major.

15:36.654 --> 15:40.389
Morse code was among them.

15:40.391 --> 15:45.094
I could swear I just
heard that machine say

15:45.096 --> 15:48.164
"The rocket's red glare. 8:30.

15:48.166 --> 15:50.800
Signed RCK".

15:50.802 --> 15:52.735
I... I just work
for your father.

15:52.737 --> 15:55.137
I... I do as I'm told.

15:55.139 --> 15:56.639
Good, because I'm telling you

15:56.641 --> 15:58.975
to start listing off
all the selected targets!

15:58.977 --> 16:00.576
I don't know!

16:00.578 --> 16:02.044
Or...

16:02.046 --> 16:03.679
Or I start breaking some fingers!

16:03.681 --> 16:05.047
No!

16:05.049 --> 16:07.416
You don't need those to operate
a telegraph, now, do you?

16:07.418 --> 16:08.884
I don't remember all the targets!

16:08.886 --> 16:10.386
I just know they're hotels, mostly.

16:10.388 --> 16:11.921
Bullshit!

16:15.226 --> 16:16.459
Corky, enough!

16:16.461 --> 16:19.061
No no! God!

16:20.264 --> 16:22.865
Adam will tell me everything he knows.

16:22.867 --> 16:25.434
Won't you, Adam? Yes.

16:29.706 --> 16:32.541
I'll go to Kennedy's hotel,

16:32.543 --> 16:34.197
see if there's anything we missed,

16:34.198 --> 16:36.078
anything that might help
us pick up his trail.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.547
I'll wait for father.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.414
Are you certain you don't want me

16:52.415 --> 16:53.896
to carry that for you, sir?

18:19.783 --> 18:22.084
What the hell is the meaning of this?!

18:22.086 --> 18:24.420
Imagine <i>my</i> surprise

18:24.422 --> 18:27.022
when I learned that my own father,

18:27.024 --> 18:31.961
social pillar of New York, is a traitor

18:31.963 --> 18:35.164
who's ruined the Morehouse name.

18:35.166 --> 18:39.135
I have <i>saved the Morehouse name.</i>

18:39.137 --> 18:42.705
Honestly, Robert,

18:42.707 --> 18:44.140
I would love nothing more than

18:44.142 --> 18:46.475
to put a bullet in your
treacherous little head...

18:46.477 --> 18:49.078
the trouble you've
caused me and my boys...

18:49.080 --> 18:52.281
but I promised Norbert, here, that

18:52.283 --> 18:55.417
I would not harm his son.

18:55.419 --> 18:58.120
Consider yourself a lucky man.

18:58.122 --> 19:01.624
Fortune is positively smiling down on me.

19:31.278 --> 19:32.612
You've been

19:32.614 --> 19:34.781
taking care of Kevin while I was gone?

19:38.486 --> 19:42.355
When he's needed taking care of.

19:42.357 --> 19:45.692
Like when Kevin hurt his leg.

19:45.694 --> 19:49.496
Yes, Annie, like then.

19:52.233 --> 19:53.733
Do me a favor?

19:53.735 --> 19:55.869
Take those in the kitchen and clean them.

20:05.746 --> 20:07.266
The way Kevin flew in here last night,

20:07.267 --> 20:10.950
it looked like the devil
himself had taken hold.

20:10.952 --> 20:13.186
Not the devil.

20:13.188 --> 20:15.155
He just realized his wife is a monster,

20:15.157 --> 20:17.957
best left locked away,

20:17.959 --> 20:20.026
best left forgotten.

20:20.028 --> 20:24.097
I doubt he believes that.

20:24.099 --> 20:28.034
I wish he'd never found me.

20:28.036 --> 20:30.436
Kevin didn't have to know the truth.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.705
He could've moved on.

20:32.707 --> 20:34.874
You know him better than that.

20:34.876 --> 20:38.244
Kevin don't move on until he's ready,

20:38.246 --> 20:40.013
until he knows what he needs to know.

20:44.351 --> 20:47.954
Was Kevin...

20:47.956 --> 20:51.090
these last few months, was he happy?

20:53.194 --> 20:54.594
No.

20:58.599 --> 21:00.633
And, for what it's worth,

21:00.635 --> 21:02.969
in my experience,

21:02.971 --> 21:07.440
true monsters feel no regret.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.415
What are we looking for?

21:15.417 --> 21:17.183
The list of the places

21:17.185 --> 21:18.685
the Rebs are going to burn.

21:27.394 --> 21:29.529
There ain't nothing here!

21:29.531 --> 21:31.030
Give me a hand.

21:34.702 --> 21:37.370
That the list?

21:37.372 --> 21:40.773
No. And we're
running out of time.

22:29.490 --> 22:31.090
Is Robert here yet?

22:31.092 --> 22:32.492
No, ma'am.

22:32.494 --> 22:34.027
Did you send word?

22:34.029 --> 22:35.461
I did.

22:35.463 --> 22:37.463
No answer as of yet, ma'am.

22:39.734 --> 22:42.902
I'd hate to miss curtain.

22:42.904 --> 22:45.505
I wonder what's keeping him.

22:45.507 --> 22:47.840
Thank you.

23:00.220 --> 23:02.622
When you went off to war,

23:02.624 --> 23:05.692
I was both proud and disappointed.

23:05.694 --> 23:08.194
Disappointed because
you've never been able

23:08.196 --> 23:10.730
to fully comprehend
the purpose of this war.

23:10.732 --> 23:13.533
Spare me the justification, father.

23:13.535 --> 23:15.635
Fetch the horses.

23:15.637 --> 23:18.037
Yes, sir.

23:20.708 --> 23:24.010
This city has burned before.

23:24.012 --> 23:27.447
It will survive.
It will thrive.

23:27.449 --> 23:28.948
Whatever damage is done,

23:28.950 --> 23:30.450
however many lives are lost,

23:30.452 --> 23:31.951
it will be for the good of New York,

23:31.953 --> 23:33.386
for the good of this country.

23:33.388 --> 23:34.854
Nothing stands between us

23:34.856 --> 23:38.758
and the pacific ocean but opportunity.

23:40.495 --> 23:41.995
I know what you're thinking.

23:41.997 --> 23:43.429
I sincerely doubt that.

23:43.431 --> 23:44.931
Standing there, judging me.

23:44.933 --> 23:46.432
One does not judge the judge.

23:46.434 --> 23:47.934
There are times when a man is forced

23:47.936 --> 23:49.435
to make difficult decisions.

23:49.437 --> 23:50.837
I'm simply wondering when, exactly,

23:50.838 --> 23:52.438
your lost your last vestige of humanity!

23:52.440 --> 23:53.940
You're just like your mother!

23:53.942 --> 23:55.641
Was it when mother died?

23:55.643 --> 23:57.610
No need for those horses.

23:57.612 --> 23:59.579
I see you found your father.

23:59.581 --> 24:03.349
Along with Kennedy.

24:03.351 --> 24:07.186
That explains his vacant hotel room.

24:11.158 --> 24:14.961
Mr. Morehouse,

24:14.963 --> 24:16.383
you and I are going to have

24:16.384 --> 24:18.064
a little discussion about Kennedy's plans.

24:18.066 --> 24:20.333
You...

24:20.335 --> 24:21.834
you have no right to interrogate me.

24:21.836 --> 24:23.403
A while ago, you told Robert

24:23.405 --> 24:26.939
that I could be useful, but that I was

24:26.941 --> 24:29.876
too smart for my own good.

24:29.878 --> 24:31.978
I think you were wrong on both accounts.

24:31.980 --> 24:34.147
Feel free to shoot him in the head

24:34.149 --> 24:36.582
if he doesn't cooperate, Corky.

24:36.584 --> 24:38.818
You'd see your own father killed?

24:38.820 --> 24:41.421
There are times when a man is forced

24:41.423 --> 24:43.723
to make difficult decisions.

25:04.611 --> 25:06.312
Alasdair!

25:08.049 --> 25:09.549
Call for my carriage.

25:12.219 --> 25:16.622
Sara, I'm sorry the visit took so long.

25:16.624 --> 25:19.826
Mr. Campbell was
chewing my ear off.

25:19.828 --> 25:25.331
But Stephen seems to be on the mend.

25:25.333 --> 25:28.835
Sara?

25:28.837 --> 25:32.338
Is everything all right?

25:32.340 --> 25:36.042
Sara?

25:36.044 --> 25:38.244
Sara.

25:38.246 --> 25:41.247
Sara.

25:41.249 --> 25:43.116
Baby, wake up.

25:43.118 --> 25:44.851
Baby, wake up, please?

25:44.853 --> 25:46.352
Come on, baby, come on.

25:52.794 --> 25:54.627
Baby, what did you do,

25:56.697 --> 25:58.097
This has the highest population.

25:58.099 --> 25:59.799
Detectives!

25:59.801 --> 26:01.134
You locate Captain Sullivan?

26:01.136 --> 26:03.296
No, sir. His housekeeper
said he went to the theater.

26:03.297 --> 26:04.704
The man does love his burlie shows.

26:04.706 --> 26:06.172
O'Neill, you and Callahan

26:06.174 --> 26:07.540
head to The Belmont.

26:07.542 --> 26:09.175
Glynn, McDuffee, The Metropolitan.

26:09.177 --> 26:10.776
I'll take Lovejoy's.

26:10.778 --> 26:12.298
Phinbar, I need you
at the St. James.

26:12.299 --> 26:13.312
Corky.

26:13.314 --> 26:14.874
Andrew, The Barnum's Museum is where...

26:14.875 --> 26:16.048
Corky!

26:22.556 --> 26:24.457
All right, gentlemen,
we've got our orders.

26:24.459 --> 26:26.125
Let's move out.

26:41.508 --> 26:44.477
You go away from me, Francis.

26:44.479 --> 26:47.079
Kevin, I...

26:47.081 --> 26:49.282
I cocked everything up.

26:49.284 --> 26:51.083
I know that.

26:51.085 --> 26:52.585
But you need me.

26:52.587 --> 26:54.086
Andrew told me what's going on.

26:54.088 --> 26:55.655
Andrew should keep his fat mouth shut.

26:55.657 --> 26:57.156
I have no need for...

26:57.158 --> 26:58.918
look, no matter what's
happened on the job,

26:58.919 --> 27:00.159
I've always been by your side.

27:00.161 --> 27:02.001
I helped you stop the
Dillingham kidnappings.

27:02.003 --> 27:03.483
Nearly lost me other eye, taking down

27:03.484 --> 27:05.031
the goddamn Glowan brothers,

27:05.033 --> 27:06.999
getting Annie out of Pompadou's.

27:07.001 --> 27:09.769
I may be a lowlife, but
I'm a damn good copper.

27:09.771 --> 27:12.538
Probably the only thing
I was ever good at.

27:12.540 --> 27:13.806
I can help you, Kevin.

27:13.808 --> 27:15.675
Let me help.

27:20.321 --> 27:21.821
It is, after all,

27:21.823 --> 27:24.257
Mr. Shakespeare's
300th birthday.

27:24.259 --> 27:25.758
And, once we've raised the funds,

27:25.760 --> 27:27.126
we'll hold a competition

27:27.128 --> 27:28.628
amongst the very best sculptors.

27:28.630 --> 27:30.330
Evening, Mrs. Haverford.

27:30.332 --> 27:31.831
You look lovely.

27:31.833 --> 27:34.467
Why, Captain Sullivan,
how nice to see you.

27:34.469 --> 27:37.136
I didn't realize you
were a fan of the bard.

27:37.138 --> 27:41.107
Any other rose would smell just as sweet.

27:41.109 --> 27:42.976
Quite impressive.

27:42.978 --> 27:46.212
Heavens, is Elizabeth Haverford

27:46.214 --> 27:48.414
here unescorted this evening?

27:48.416 --> 27:50.283
Mr. Morehouse appears
to have been delayed,

27:50.285 --> 27:52.018
so I came alone.

27:52.020 --> 27:54.287
Well, if that's the case,
might I have the privilege

27:54.289 --> 27:55.722
of escorting you to your seat?

27:55.724 --> 27:57.757
Why, Captain, what a lovely offer.

27:57.759 --> 27:59.292
But, as a guest of the Booths,

27:59.294 --> 28:00.894
I'll be sitting in Edwin's private box.

28:00.896 --> 28:02.495
Of course.

28:02.497 --> 28:04.864
Well, I suppose I should get to my seat.

28:04.866 --> 28:06.633
I hope to see you at the intermission.

28:06.635 --> 28:08.902
Enjoy the show.

28:34.028 --> 28:35.495
Liberty!

28:35.497 --> 28:36.896
Freedom!

28:36.898 --> 28:38.631
Tyranny is dead!

28:38.633 --> 28:40.020
That mothers shall but smile

28:40.021 --> 28:41.301
when they behold their children,

28:41.303 --> 28:42.969
quarter'd with the hands of war;

28:42.971 --> 28:44.704
All pity choked

28:44.706 --> 28:46.606
with custom of fell deeds:

28:46.608 --> 28:49.342
And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,

28:49.344 --> 28:50.944
with ate by his side come hot from hell,

28:50.945 --> 28:52.865
shall in these confines
with a monarch's voice,

28:52.866 --> 28:53.947
cry 'havoc!'

28:53.949 --> 28:56.249
and let slip the dogs of war;

28:56.251 --> 28:58.718
That this foul deed shall
smell above the earth

28:58.720 --> 29:02.755
with carrion men, groaning for burial.

29:02.757 --> 29:04.857
Revenge!
About! Seek! Burn!

29:04.859 --> 29:07.760
Fire! Kill! Slay!

29:07.762 --> 29:09.896
Let not a traitor live!

29:09.898 --> 29:11.397
Good friends, sweet friends,

29:11.399 --> 29:12.865
let me not stir you up

29:12.867 --> 29:14.400
to such a sudden flood of mutiny.

29:14.402 --> 29:17.070
They that have done this
deed are honourable:

29:17.072 --> 29:18.571
What private griefs they have,

29:18.573 --> 29:20.073
alas, I know not,

29:20.075 --> 29:21.741
that made them do it:

29:21.743 --> 29:23.710
They are wise

29:23.712 --> 29:25.812
and honourable.

29:25.814 --> 29:28.147
If that thou be'st a Roman,

29:28.149 --> 29:30.049
take it forth;

29:30.051 --> 29:33.319
I, that denied thee gold,
will give my heart:

29:33.321 --> 29:35.161
Strike! As thou didst
at Caesar; For, I know,

29:35.162 --> 29:36.623
when thou didst hate him worst,

29:36.625 --> 29:38.124
thou lovedst him better

29:38.126 --> 29:40.126
than ever thou lovedst Cassius.

29:40.128 --> 29:41.594
Sheathe your dagger:

29:41.596 --> 29:43.463
Be angry when you will,
it shall have scope;

29:43.465 --> 29:44.998
Do what you will,

29:45.000 --> 29:46.499
dishonour shall be humour.

29:46.501 --> 29:50.903
O Cassius! You are
yoked with a lamb

29:50.905 --> 29:53.973
that carries anger
as the flint bears fire;

29:53.975 --> 29:57.110
Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,

29:57.112 --> 30:00.947
and straight is cold again.

30:00.949 --> 30:04.484
Good words are better than
bad strokes, Octavius.

30:05.887 --> 30:08.287
Ladies and gentlemen,
there is no cause for alarm.

30:08.289 --> 30:10.223
A small fire was discovered

30:10.225 --> 30:12.325
next door at the Lafarge house

30:12.327 --> 30:14.494
and was quickly extinguished.

30:14.496 --> 30:16.796
The only individuals
in danger this evening

30:16.798 --> 30:18.798
are the characters on the stage.

30:19.968 --> 30:21.668
To whom, we might point out,

30:21.670 --> 30:23.970
the danger is not from fire,

30:23.972 --> 30:26.105
but from their own ambition.

30:27.509 --> 30:30.843
Friends, romans, countrymen,

30:30.845 --> 30:32.245
what say we continue with the show?

30:36.016 --> 30:37.517
In your bad strokes, Brutus,

30:37.519 --> 30:39.018
excuse me. You give good words:

30:39.020 --> 30:40.853
Witness the hole you made
in Caesar's heart,

30:40.855 --> 30:43.456
crying 'long live!
Hail, Caesar!'

30:43.458 --> 30:45.958
Antony, the posture of your blows

30:45.960 --> 30:48.428
are yet unknown;
But for your words,

30:48.430 --> 30:49.729
they rob the hybla bees,

30:49.731 --> 30:51.764
and leave them honeyless.

30:51.766 --> 30:53.266
Not stingless too.

30:53.268 --> 30:55.535
Yes, and soundless too;

30:55.537 --> 30:57.937
For you rob them of their buzzing, Antony,

30:57.939 --> 31:01.541
and very wisely threat before you sting.

31:01.543 --> 31:02.775
Villains!

31:15.189 --> 31:19.158
The fires are out now!

31:19.160 --> 31:20.460
The city is safe!

31:25.132 --> 31:26.799
Thank you, Alasdair.

31:29.336 --> 31:31.204
What do you think you're doing here?

31:31.206 --> 31:32.839
You have to help me.
I'm being hunted.

31:32.841 --> 31:34.340
I must escape the city.

31:34.342 --> 31:35.842
Now, you got plenty of money.

31:35.844 --> 31:37.443
We could make a run for it to Canada,

31:37.445 --> 31:39.112
start over, start a new life.

31:39.114 --> 31:40.213
No!

31:40.215 --> 31:42.281
"No"? What do you mean?

31:42.283 --> 31:44.450
You lied to me, Bobby.

31:44.452 --> 31:45.812
You said it would just be Barnum's

31:45.813 --> 31:47.053
and the docks that would burn,

31:47.055 --> 31:48.554
late at night,

31:48.556 --> 31:50.156
when no innocent people were around.

31:50.158 --> 31:51.991
You forgot to mention the hotels...

31:51.993 --> 31:53.493
the true aim of your destruction.

31:53.495 --> 31:55.061
Our cause is just.

31:55.063 --> 31:57.230
But your means are not.

31:57.232 --> 31:58.464
Now, run.

32:07.327 --> 32:10.046
I sacrificed a great
deal for this country.

32:11.766 --> 32:13.399
The leg that I lost on that battlefield

32:13.401 --> 32:15.501
was a wonderful leg.

32:15.503 --> 32:19.605
It was, by far, the better of the two.

32:19.607 --> 32:21.340
Due to my honorable sacrifice

32:21.342 --> 32:24.610
and the part I played in
exposing the conspiracy,

32:24.612 --> 32:26.979
the Union is eternally grateful to me,

32:26.981 --> 32:28.781
a gratitude which now means

32:28.783 --> 32:31.784
good fortune for <i>you.</i>

32:31.786 --> 32:33.286
Per my request, President Lincoln

32:33.288 --> 32:35.388
will not hang you for treason.

32:35.390 --> 32:37.423
You'll not even be imprisoned, father.

32:40.794 --> 32:43.029
Thank you, son.

32:43.031 --> 32:44.530
Instead, you have been granted

32:44.532 --> 32:45.998
the distinct privilege of relocating

32:46.000 --> 32:50.203
and assisting in the recovery of Atlanta.

32:50.205 --> 32:51.304
What?

32:51.306 --> 32:52.805
Extraordinary, isn't it?

32:52.807 --> 32:55.041
An opportunity to reinvent yourself

32:55.043 --> 32:58.344
as a small-business
entrepreneur.

32:58.346 --> 32:59.846
You, of course, will be given

32:59.848 --> 33:02.148
enough capital to start said business.

33:02.150 --> 33:06.219
Atlanta's a hotbed of opportunities

33:06.221 --> 33:09.088
since the city was burned by Sherman.

33:09.090 --> 33:11.224
Relish this chance, father.

33:11.226 --> 33:13.025
I have no doubt you will flourish.

33:17.664 --> 33:20.533
You and I will not see one another again.

33:20.535 --> 33:23.002
Which, as far as I'm concerned,

33:23.004 --> 33:24.637
is not long enough.

33:36.450 --> 33:38.784
Matthew.

33:38.786 --> 33:40.152
The baby!

33:41.990 --> 33:43.489
The baby's fine.
The baby's fine.

33:43.491 --> 33:45.925
It's fine.

33:45.927 --> 33:47.360
You both are.

33:47.362 --> 33:50.363
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

33:50.365 --> 33:54.066
No no no no no no no, no no.

33:54.068 --> 33:58.170
That stuff was 90% water, 10% alcohol.

34:00.274 --> 34:04.210
Mama, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, mama.

34:07.916 --> 34:09.982
Just go to sleep now, okay?

34:09.984 --> 34:11.918
You just go to sleep.

34:11.920 --> 34:15.888
I'll find your mama for you, okay?

34:15.889 --> 34:20.693
I'm going to take care of everything.

34:20.695 --> 34:24.297
Behold, friends of Carmansville!

34:24.299 --> 34:26.933
The remedy to all your ailments.

34:26.935 --> 34:30.636
This here is <i>the</i>
<i>gen-u-ine article,</i>

34:30.638 --> 34:33.773
an elixir scientifically proven

34:33.775 --> 34:37.076
to cure over 31 known diseases,

34:37.078 --> 34:38.878
from toothaches to lumbago,

34:38.880 --> 34:40.846
rheumatism to neuralgia.

34:40.848 --> 34:43.916
Another enthusiastic customer.

34:45.620 --> 34:48.120
You sold my wife your snake oil?!

34:48.121 --> 34:50.389
You could've killed her
and our unborn child!

34:50.391 --> 34:51.891
There must be some mistake.

34:53.628 --> 34:55.127
How many others have you

34:55.129 --> 34:58.731
taken advantage of, promising false hopes

34:58.733 --> 35:00.666
and filling their stomachs with poison?!

35:00.668 --> 35:02.935
I'm a man of science!

35:02.937 --> 35:04.337
You're a disease.

35:16.049 --> 35:18.818
If I ever catch you peddling your venom

35:18.820 --> 35:21.654
around my wife again, I will kill you.

35:21.656 --> 35:23.155
Do we have an understanding?

35:42.609 --> 35:46.779
Last night went from tragedy to bliss.

35:46.781 --> 35:50.483
Better to end in bliss.

35:50.485 --> 35:53.719
You're my first hero.

35:56.357 --> 35:58.190
When you're rich, it's easy to be a hero.

35:58.192 --> 36:00.159
When you're rich, it's
easy to be a villain.

36:00.161 --> 36:04.997
Have you ever tried poor?

36:04.999 --> 36:06.165
Yes.

36:06.167 --> 36:09.235
Poor is tragedy.

36:13.540 --> 36:15.541
Kevin,

36:15.543 --> 36:17.043
I need you to hear me.

36:17.045 --> 36:19.078
Save your strength, you idiot.

36:19.080 --> 36:20.579
When you came back from the war,

36:20.581 --> 36:23.549
I was going to tell you
everything, I swear,

36:23.551 --> 36:26.352
but I lost my nerve.

36:26.354 --> 36:28.020
Things, they...

36:28.022 --> 36:31.023
they spun out of control.

36:31.025 --> 36:35.494
I tried to get the ledger from Grindle,

36:35.496 --> 36:37.530
but she wouldn't hand the damn thing over.

36:37.532 --> 36:39.832
We fought.

36:39.834 --> 36:43.502
I ended up killing her.

36:43.504 --> 36:46.472
Shit, Francis.

36:46.474 --> 36:49.241
If I knew she lived up on 14th Street...

36:49.243 --> 36:52.511
that's where Mary found the ledger.

36:52.513 --> 36:55.448
I went crazy,

36:55.450 --> 36:58.250
I demanded she hand the thing over,

36:58.252 --> 37:04.990
but she refused,

37:04.992 --> 37:07.660
just like her sister,
she ended up the same way.

37:10.597 --> 37:13.899
No matter what I do,

37:13.901 --> 37:20.573
I end up killing the things I love.

37:20.575 --> 37:23.709
I'm not asking for forgiveness, Kevin.

37:23.711 --> 37:27.079
I needed you to know the entire truth.

37:27.081 --> 37:28.581
You deserve that much from me.

37:42.529 --> 37:48.167
We've all committed our share of sins.

37:48.169 --> 37:49.935
Some of them part of the job,

37:49.937 --> 37:52.538
some of them...

37:52.540 --> 37:56.208
Part of us.

37:56.210 --> 37:58.444
But you confessing all

37:58.446 --> 38:00.579
don't make the worst go away.

38:00.581 --> 38:03.115
Out, gentlemen.

38:03.117 --> 38:04.383
This man needs surgery.

38:04.385 --> 38:07.286
Tare an'ouns, don't leave me

38:07.288 --> 38:08.988
in the hands of this quack.

38:08.990 --> 38:11.624
I'll just die a natural death.

38:11.626 --> 38:13.459
Think of it as part of your penance.

38:15.462 --> 38:17.997
Thank you

38:17.999 --> 38:24.470
for watching after
them... Ellen.

38:24.472 --> 38:28.474
It meant a lot, to know she was safe.

38:28.476 --> 38:31.710
Don't grow accustomed.

38:31.712 --> 38:38.517
I'm a whore, not a nursemaid.

38:38.519 --> 38:43.656
It's time <i>you</i> tended to your family.

38:43.658 --> 38:45.424
Eva, you and I...

38:45.426 --> 38:46.525
ugh!

38:46.527 --> 38:48.594
Corky, please,

38:48.596 --> 38:50.095
there's no need to acknowledge

38:50.097 --> 38:51.897
the corn on my account.

38:51.899 --> 38:54.700
I knew the day would come

38:54.702 --> 38:56.969
that our little dance
would run its course.

39:01.541 --> 39:04.710
You're a remarkable woman.

39:04.712 --> 39:06.712
You're goddamn right I am.

39:06.714 --> 39:11.750
I just need to find a man

39:11.752 --> 39:14.620
who doesn't always
slip off into the night.

39:14.622 --> 39:16.155
I don't know,

39:16.157 --> 39:20.459
a business partner, perhaps.

39:20.461 --> 39:21.961
The Mayor's a widower.

39:29.302 --> 39:30.936
We had some smiles, you and I.

39:41.181 --> 39:42.781
See you around, copper.

42:48.868 --> 42:51.703
Maggie. Maggie.
