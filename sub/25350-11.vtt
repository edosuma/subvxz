WEBVTT

00:10.943 --> 00:13.678
I am seeing, like,
a shadow woman.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.347
She's crawling onto
this person and just,

00:16.350 --> 00:18.482
like, melding with them.

00:18.484 --> 00:20.685
My mom's health is bad.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.554
I think
it's trying to kill her.

00:22.556 --> 00:26.224
She says that she was murdered
and wants revenge.

00:26.226 --> 00:30.562
Pulls her out of a taxi
and shoots her.

00:30.564 --> 00:33.465
And I'm so afraid
I'm gonna lose my mom.

00:33.467 --> 00:37.101
She's killing this person.

00:37.103 --> 00:40.905
She just hurts people
indiscriminately,

00:40.907 --> 00:43.508
and I just feel fear.

00:43.510 --> 00:45.310
My name is Amy Allan.

00:45.312 --> 00:46.444
This is, like,

00:46.446 --> 00:48.579
Grand Central Station
for the dead.

00:48.581 --> 00:49.781
I see dead people.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.983
They have pain
that they suffered.

00:51.985 --> 00:53.984
I speak to dead people.

00:53.986 --> 00:56.855
She hates them, hates them.

00:56.857 --> 00:59.057
And they speak to me,

00:59.059 --> 01:02.660
but there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

01:02.662 --> 01:03.928
It's a demon.

01:03.930 --> 01:06.063
It's Satan.

01:06.065 --> 01:07.599
I rely on my partner.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.133
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:09.135 --> 01:11.469
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:11.471 --> 01:12.871
What was the body count?
What happened?

01:12.873 --> 01:16.540
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:16.542 --> 01:17.742
I don't know
if it's a demon or not,

01:17.744 --> 01:19.477
but it sure as hell
looks like one.

01:19.479 --> 01:21.078
It's my job to reveal them.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.614
I feel like I'm crazy.

01:23.616 --> 01:25.416
But Steve and I never speak...

01:25.418 --> 01:27.485
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:27.487 --> 01:29.020
...until the very end.

01:29.022 --> 01:30.822
I want to show you this.

01:30.824 --> 01:32.623
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

01:32.625 --> 01:35.493
I just don't want anything
to happen to my mother.

01:35.495 --> 01:37.028
Or time to get out.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.663
You have to get out.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:50.243 --> 01:51.976
I'm out here,
in Lynchburg, Ohio.

01:51.978 --> 01:54.779
It's about an hour east
of Cincinnati.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.580
I got a call from a woman
named Carissa.

01:56.582 --> 01:59.317
Now, she is freaked out,
thinks the paranormal

01:59.319 --> 02:02.253
is going after her kids
and her elderly mom.

02:02.255 --> 02:04.322
Now, this lady used to be
an MMA fighter,

02:04.324 --> 02:07.358
so if she's scared,
things have got to be bad.

02:10.062 --> 02:12.263
Before Amy arrives,

02:12.265 --> 02:14.999
I look for any leading
information.

02:15.001 --> 02:19.737
Artwork, family photos,
and religious symbols

02:19.739 --> 02:21.805
can influence her findings,

02:21.807 --> 02:24.742
so it's important that I cover
or remove them all.

02:24.744 --> 02:26.811
When I'm finished,
the location will be ready

02:26.813 --> 02:28.345
for tonight's walk.

02:40.827 --> 02:41.759
This is weird.

02:41.761 --> 02:45.630
A woman in war paint came to me

02:45.632 --> 02:48.366
and says to be aware
of the snakes on the land.

02:56.309 --> 02:57.709
So there's an old man
in there.

03:03.383 --> 03:05.917
I think he's one of the snakes.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.785
He will kill you.
He has killed people.

03:14.327 --> 03:15.593
So, Carissa,
sitting out here with you,

03:15.595 --> 03:18.195
it's hard to imagine
there's anything wrong.

03:18.197 --> 03:19.931
I mean,
what's going on here?

03:19.933 --> 03:23.134
The paranormal activity
in this house

03:23.136 --> 03:25.002
is absolutely out of control.

03:25.004 --> 03:27.739
My mom's health is bad.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.140
I think
it's trying to kill her.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.743
- Okay.
- My kids are being attacked.

03:31.745 --> 03:34.746
Who exactly is living
in the house now?

03:34.748 --> 03:37.014
- We got myself --
- Right.

03:37.016 --> 03:39.083
...my 15-year-old son, Eric,

03:39.085 --> 03:42.153
my 7-year-old daughter,
Keira, my husband,

03:42.155 --> 03:44.822
Terry, and my mom, Debbie.

03:44.824 --> 03:46.224
Okay.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.025
So how long have you been here?

03:48.027 --> 03:50.027
We have been here
almost nine years.

03:50.029 --> 03:51.095
When did things change?

03:51.097 --> 03:53.731
Probably about two years ago,

03:53.733 --> 03:55.700
my daughter started
seeing stuff,

03:55.702 --> 03:58.969
and once she started
having her experiences,

03:58.971 --> 04:00.571
all hell broke loose.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.106
So any thoughts
on what's causing

04:02.108 --> 04:03.374
the activity in the house?

04:03.376 --> 04:04.976
A lot of times, I've worried

04:04.978 --> 04:10.180
that it's that really
old cemetery back there.

04:12.184 --> 04:15.786
So you got a cemetery
in your backyard.
Yeah.

04:15.788 --> 04:18.589
All right, so what kinds of
things are you experiencing now?

04:18.591 --> 04:20.391
We are being watched.

04:20.392 --> 04:22.459
Objects are being thrown.

04:22.461 --> 04:24.929
There's constant
shadow figures.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.264
We are physically
being touched,

04:27.266 --> 04:30.768
and health is just
constantly declining.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.470
All right,
so is everybody in the house

04:32.472 --> 04:34.072
being affected
by the health issues?

04:34.074 --> 04:35.473
My mom is the worst.

04:35.475 --> 04:37.875
She's actually
in the hospital now,

04:37.877 --> 04:40.945
and she's told me
that it's trying to kill her.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.480
So as far as for me,

04:42.482 --> 04:46.550
I can't blame health issues
on the paranormal.

04:46.552 --> 04:50.622
Maybe Amy could give us an idea
what's going on with that.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.090
I hope so.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.557
How are you holding up
with all this?

04:53.559 --> 04:55.159
Not well.

04:55.161 --> 04:57.962
I don't know what the ****
I'm fighting here. I don't...

04:57.964 --> 04:59.397
How do you fight
what you can't see?

04:59.399 --> 05:01.699
How do I defend my kids?

05:04.904 --> 05:08.973
Trying to keep my son

05:08.975 --> 05:12.043
from just
falling into a dark hole

05:12.045 --> 05:15.113
that I can't get him
back out of.

05:15.115 --> 05:18.248
And my daughter
is just terrified,

05:18.250 --> 05:20.918
and I'm so afraid
I'm gonna lose my mom.

05:30.196 --> 05:33.531
So I'm seeing a guy
who's drinking.

05:33.533 --> 05:35.332
He's just, like,
moving around the room,

05:35.334 --> 05:37.468
like, almost, like,
bouncing off the walls.

05:41.875 --> 05:45.409
He seems frustrated,
a little confused.

05:45.411 --> 05:50.481
People might hear him, like,
moving around and moving stuff.

05:53.553 --> 05:57.889
He died or began
his death process here.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.897
All right, Carissa.
So what's going on in here?

06:05.899 --> 06:07.832
We see shadow figures.

06:07.834 --> 06:09.834
They were just constantly
running around the floor

06:09.836 --> 06:11.903
and all over the ceilings.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.304
So when you're seeing
the shadow figures,

06:13.306 --> 06:15.840
what exactly
is it looking like?

06:15.842 --> 06:18.109
Very large black figure.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.377
You cannot see through it.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.712
- Is everybody seeing them?
- Absolutely.

06:21.714 --> 06:27.251
They will rush you and one time
actually knocked me over.

06:27.253 --> 06:29.386
Now, anything else physical
like that happen to you?

06:29.388 --> 06:31.455
Yes, I have been choked.

06:31.457 --> 06:34.659
Two hands around my neck
is what it felt like,

06:34.661 --> 06:36.794
just could not get air.

06:36.796 --> 06:39.263
Okay, so, but it felt
like a human hand?

06:39.265 --> 06:43.868
Yeah, just fingers digging in,
and when I looked in the mirror,

06:43.870 --> 06:47.872
there were scratches down
my neck and across my chest,

06:47.874 --> 06:48.940
and I took a picture of it.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.613
Pretty wild ****.

06:55.615 --> 06:57.949
If it breaks me,
my family is doomed.

06:57.951 --> 07:02.753
I have to fight, constantly
on guard, constantly.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.694
I am seeing, like,
a shadow woman,

07:09.696 --> 07:12.563
and she's got really long hair.

07:12.565 --> 07:18.903
She does grab people's necks
and do weird ****.

07:18.905 --> 07:22.806
She indicated a living lady
who is a bigger lady.

07:22.808 --> 07:24.842
I'd put her in her 40s or 50s.

07:24.844 --> 07:27.645
People would feel like
they're being touched,

07:27.647 --> 07:29.513
possibly pushed,

07:29.515 --> 07:32.784
long fingers
around their throats.

07:32.786 --> 07:37.188
She said she makes them
feel like her, "Feel my pain,"

07:37.190 --> 07:38.989
which is physical pain.

07:38.991 --> 07:43.060
She says that she was murdered
and wants revenge.

07:43.062 --> 07:46.129
She can't remember
who did this,

07:46.131 --> 07:50.668
so she just hurts people,
like, indiscriminately now.

07:50.670 --> 07:54.605
What I am thinking is that
the living here,

07:54.607 --> 07:58.342
they can see her
as a shadow figure.

07:58.344 --> 08:02.547
They would see red eyes,
and she moves like a spider,

08:02.549 --> 08:04.282
and then I heard "black widow."

08:11.023 --> 08:13.024
Okay, Carissa.
What's the story with this room?

08:13.026 --> 08:15.626
This is my mom's room.
This is where she sleeps.

08:15.628 --> 08:21.298
And you constantly
are feeling fine one minute

08:21.300 --> 08:24.701
and then aggressively angry,
I mean, to the point

08:24.703 --> 08:28.105
where I want to smack
the hell out of somebody.

08:28.107 --> 08:29.573
Something just takes me over

08:29.575 --> 08:34.445
and turns me into this terrible
human being that I am not.

08:34.447 --> 08:36.480
So I know you're concerned
about your mom's health.

08:36.482 --> 08:38.782
As far as the paranormal goes,
what's she going through?

08:38.784 --> 08:43.120
She sees shadows,
shadow figures all the time,

08:43.121 --> 08:45.723
just constantly,
and she woke up the other night,

08:45.725 --> 08:48.592
and one was standing
over top of her.

08:48.594 --> 08:51.261
My first worst fear is coming
down here one day,

08:51.263 --> 08:53.864
and she's gone.

08:53.866 --> 08:57.535
I'm curious what you're hoping
for out of our investigation.

08:57.537 --> 09:03.074
I'm hoping that you can help me
save my family.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.876
I just want to take care
of my kids and my mom.

09:09.482 --> 09:10.948
I am seeing...

09:10.950 --> 09:15.152
This person is seeing a shadow
figure at the end of her bed.

09:15.154 --> 09:16.621
She's here.

09:16.623 --> 09:19.156
The shadow woman, she's doing
bad things to this person.

09:19.158 --> 09:22.826
- In what respect?
- She's crawling.

09:22.828 --> 09:25.963
She's crawling on the bed.

09:25.965 --> 09:28.366
She's crawling onto this person

09:28.368 --> 09:31.635
and just, like,
melding with them.

09:31.637 --> 09:36.773
It's like she goes inside this
other person's body,

09:36.775 --> 09:41.512
all of her mental and emotional
and physical pain,

09:41.514 --> 09:43.647
the person would experience

09:43.649 --> 09:47.785
this anger

09:47.787 --> 09:52.990
and sadness and frustration

09:52.992 --> 09:56.527
and feeling like

09:56.529 --> 10:01.131
you want to hurt people.

10:01.133 --> 10:04.602
I know that this person
specifically is suffering

10:04.604 --> 10:06.470
due to that,

10:06.472 --> 10:10.808
and it could be
extremely detrimental

10:10.810 --> 10:12.610
for this living person.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.279
I think it could potentially
kill this person.

10:41.039 --> 10:43.106
So, Terry, obviously
your wife called us in

10:43.108 --> 10:45.308
because of the stuff
going on in the house.
Yeah.

10:45.310 --> 10:47.510
And she thinks whatever is here
is pretty damn dangerous,

10:47.512 --> 10:49.712
especially for the kids
and your mother-in-law.

10:49.714 --> 10:50.714
Do you agree with that at all?

10:50.716 --> 10:52.382
- Very much.
- Okay.

10:52.384 --> 10:54.451
She was also talking to me
about the whole family

10:54.453 --> 10:56.119
dealing with these mood swings.

10:56.121 --> 10:57.254
You know, I would say
in the past year,

10:57.256 --> 10:58.655
it's gotten worse.

10:58.657 --> 11:01.191
We just -- We're always down
each other's throat.

11:01.193 --> 11:02.392
We're always arguing.

11:02.394 --> 11:03.993
We've never been
that way before.

11:03.995 --> 11:07.330
- Have you had experiences?
- Yes. I've had a few.

11:07.332 --> 11:09.265
Okay. So why don't
we talk about it?

11:09.267 --> 11:11.467
We'll be sitting
in the living room.

11:11.469 --> 11:14.003
All of a sudden,
it drops 20, 30 degrees.

11:14.005 --> 11:15.738
I mean, it gets cold.

11:15.740 --> 11:18.007
Is it in one concise spot?

11:18.009 --> 11:19.275
One spot.

11:19.277 --> 11:21.011
And how long does
this cold last?

11:21.013 --> 11:22.879
- Minutes.
- Okay.

11:22.881 --> 11:23.880
It's weird, right?

11:23.882 --> 11:25.215
It's very weird.

11:25.217 --> 11:26.816
All right, anything else?

11:26.818 --> 11:28.218
Well, I was out in front
of the garage,

11:28.220 --> 11:30.086
and I looked up
at my daughter's room,

11:30.088 --> 11:33.290
and I see this big
dark object with red eyes.

11:33.292 --> 11:36.960
I immediately run upstairs
to make sure what was going on,

11:36.962 --> 11:39.495
but, I mean, there was nothing
there when I got up there.

11:39.497 --> 11:40.764
All right, anything else?

11:40.766 --> 11:43.900
I was standing outside my garage
working on a truck,

11:43.902 --> 11:46.636
and maybe six to eight feet
in front of me,

11:46.638 --> 11:49.039
there's this person
standing there.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.107
Okay.
Can you describe them for me?

11:51.109 --> 11:53.643
Short hair, very clean-cut.

11:53.645 --> 11:57.847
All of a sudden, I look back
over, and it was gone.

11:57.849 --> 11:59.850
What the hell do you think
is going on in this house?

11:59.852 --> 12:03.920
I think it's evil.

12:03.922 --> 12:08.925
I'm seeing a very bad man.

12:08.927 --> 12:10.794
I think he's the brother
of that guy

12:10.796 --> 12:13.663
who was bouncing off the walls,

12:13.665 --> 12:16.866
and he's very angry.

12:16.868 --> 12:21.271
He carries around
the cold of winter.

12:21.273 --> 12:24.607
He doesn't like children,
and he will kill them.

12:31.950 --> 12:33.416
So, Keira, how old are you?

12:33.418 --> 12:35.352
-7.
-7, okay.

12:35.354 --> 12:36.753
So I was talking to
Mommy earlier,

12:36.755 --> 12:37.888
and she was saying
there's some stuff going on

12:37.890 --> 12:40.022
in the house
that's pretty scary.
Yeah.

12:40.024 --> 12:41.791
Anything you can
tell me about?

12:41.793 --> 12:45.095
I see a man come out
of my closet.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.629
Okay, what is he wearing?

12:46.631 --> 12:49.499
Blue pants and a blue shirt,

12:49.501 --> 12:51.501
and he has brown hair.

12:51.503 --> 12:53.569
And what does he do
when he comes out, honey?

12:53.571 --> 12:56.439
Sometimes he talks
a little bit.

12:56.441 --> 12:58.641
Okay, does this guy scare you?

12:58.643 --> 13:00.643
He'd scare me, too, I think.

13:00.645 --> 13:02.979
So I don't like to sleep
in my room.
Okay.

13:02.981 --> 13:06.716
So sometimes,
I just stay awake.

13:06.718 --> 13:09.052
Okay. So have you seen
anything else, honey?

13:09.054 --> 13:11.187
I see a little girl.

13:11.189 --> 13:12.255
Okay. What does she wear?

13:12.257 --> 13:15.458
She wears, like,
a little old dress.

13:15.460 --> 13:20.196
She had very short hair,
and it was very curly.

13:20.198 --> 13:22.732
She had a little bow, too.

13:22.734 --> 13:25.001
Okay.
Does she scare you at all?
Yeah.

13:25.003 --> 13:27.403
Every time I go past my room,

13:27.405 --> 13:30.406
I have to run because
it's not fun seeing them.
Yeah.

13:30.408 --> 13:33.343
We're gonna try to get rid
of all this stuff you're seeing.

13:33.345 --> 13:34.677
- Would you like that?
- Yeah.

13:34.679 --> 13:36.079
I don't want them here anymore.

13:36.081 --> 13:38.481
- No. You like living here.
- Yeah.

13:38.483 --> 13:41.618
- I like when they're all gone.
- Okay.

13:46.224 --> 13:49.759
I am seeing a dead child.

13:49.761 --> 13:54.564
She was laughing and giggling
and ran up the stairs.

13:54.566 --> 13:57.700
She likes this space.

13:57.702 --> 13:59.969
I see her jumping around,

13:59.971 --> 14:05.441
and I think they would feel
her jumping around on them.

14:05.443 --> 14:07.977
She goes in and out
of the closet.

14:07.979 --> 14:09.846
Can you describe her at all?

14:09.848 --> 14:13.316
She's very young, curly hair.

14:13.318 --> 14:16.185
I want to say she was sick

14:16.187 --> 14:20.456
for a long time,

14:20.458 --> 14:22.458
and then she died.

14:26.931 --> 14:29.132
So, Eric, how old are you?

14:29.134 --> 14:31.267
I'm 15.

14:31.269 --> 14:33.269
So I was talking to Mom today,
and she was telling me

14:33.271 --> 14:35.071
about the stuff
that's going on in the house,

14:35.073 --> 14:36.672
and she thinks
it's pretty dangerous.

14:36.674 --> 14:38.741
Do you agree that
it's dangerous?
Yes.

14:38.743 --> 14:42.078
I understand that everybody
is having experiences. Have you?

14:42.080 --> 14:43.213
Yes, I have.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.014
Okay, so why don't we talk
about some of them?

14:45.016 --> 14:47.550
Sometimes I hear a voice
call my name,

14:47.552 --> 14:50.419
like, it was, like,
whispering in my ear.

14:50.421 --> 14:53.022
It kind of sounds
like a woman to me.

14:53.024 --> 14:55.759
All right, so that's got to be
a little scary to hear that.
Yeah.

14:55.761 --> 14:57.493
Okay. So what else?

14:57.495 --> 14:59.095
Sometimes
I'm trying to sleep.

14:59.097 --> 15:03.299
I feel something touching me
like a cold touch.

15:03.301 --> 15:04.567
Where do you feel it?

15:04.569 --> 15:07.970
In my arm or, like,
touch my hair or whatever.

15:07.972 --> 15:10.440
Now Mom was telling me
about everybody getting sicker.

15:10.442 --> 15:12.375
So do you think the stuff
that's going on in the house,

15:12.377 --> 15:16.379
the paranormal activity,
is making it worse for you?

15:16.381 --> 15:17.847
Yeah, I believe so.

15:17.849 --> 15:21.251
I've been kind of feeling,
like, worse lately.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.986
Okay.

15:23.988 --> 15:26.455
There's another woman here.

15:26.457 --> 15:27.657
She's a mess, and I would say

15:27.659 --> 15:32.195
she's a pioneer lady
from the 1800s.

15:32.197 --> 15:34.931
She was very, very sick.

15:34.933 --> 15:38.334
I think she's one of
the most consistent

15:38.336 --> 15:41.270
and hands-on
dead people here.

15:41.272 --> 15:44.140
She reaches out a lot.

15:44.142 --> 15:45.941
I think that the living
would see her.

15:45.943 --> 15:47.343
I think they would feel her.

15:47.345 --> 15:49.278
I see her getting into bed
with people.

15:49.280 --> 15:51.413
I see her holding on to people.

15:51.415 --> 15:55.151
She's very, like, consuming.

15:55.153 --> 15:58.088
So I think that the living
would have a lot

15:58.090 --> 16:02.625
of the physical illness.

16:02.627 --> 16:06.696
She kind of drains
their energy.

16:06.698 --> 16:11.234
Burning up so hot,
she was terrible.

16:11.236 --> 16:12.302
It's horrible.

16:30.454 --> 16:34.389
Carissa's got a cemetery
right behind her house.

16:34.391 --> 16:36.792
It's not every day
I get a lead this good.

16:36.794 --> 16:38.393
So I'm headed back
to the property

16:38.395 --> 16:40.195
to meet an historian who says

16:40.197 --> 16:42.798
that the cemetery
is filled with dead kids,

16:42.800 --> 16:45.800
and most of them died
the same horrible way.

16:50.940 --> 16:53.008
Well, Elaine, I appreciate you
helping me out with this case.

16:53.010 --> 16:55.477
Now, before we get to all these
dead people here,

16:55.479 --> 16:58.145
what do you know
about the cemetery itself?

16:58.147 --> 17:00.482
This is the Morrow-Bobbitt
Cemetery.

17:00.484 --> 17:02.884
Where does the name
Morrow-Bobbitt come from?

17:02.886 --> 17:05.486
All of this land here,
it was a very large farm

17:05.488 --> 17:07.422
owned by the Morrow family,

17:07.424 --> 17:09.691
and then later,
they sold it to the Bobbitts,

17:09.693 --> 17:11.092
but all of these lots,

17:11.094 --> 17:13.761
including the property
that you're looking at,

17:13.762 --> 17:16.431
they're all on
the Morrow property.

17:16.433 --> 17:17.898
So, Elaine, you mentioned
on the phone

17:17.901 --> 17:21.169
that this cemetery is filled
with a lot of dead kids, right?

17:21.171 --> 17:22.569
What's the story with that?

17:22.571 --> 17:27.642
This cemetery was largely
for cholera-era victims --
Okay.

17:27.644 --> 17:30.711
...infants,
toddlers, teenagers,

17:30.713 --> 17:33.247
people in their 20s cut down
in their prime of life.

17:33.249 --> 17:35.717
So was this area hit hard
with this epidemic?

17:35.719 --> 17:38.719
Yes, I think worse than
in the big cities

17:38.721 --> 17:40.188
because in the rural areas,

17:40.190 --> 17:44.992
they would actually fertilize
with human sewage sometimes.

17:44.994 --> 17:47.195
So when did most of these
people die?

17:47.197 --> 17:49.264
In the 1840s, 1850s.

17:49.266 --> 17:52.466
So I know about cholera from
my past investigations,

17:52.468 --> 17:54.335
but remind me,
what were the symptoms of that?

17:54.337 --> 17:56.671
Fever,
there would be vomiting.

17:56.673 --> 18:01.409
The main thing was diarrhea,
and there would be deaths

18:01.411 --> 18:05.880
and burials every few days,
if not every day.

18:05.882 --> 18:09.417
Would any of the original owners
of my client's property

18:09.419 --> 18:11.552
died from that
and been buried here?
Yes.

18:11.554 --> 18:15.957
Two of the Morrow daughters died
during the cholera epidemic --
Okay.

18:15.959 --> 18:18.426
...and they're buried
right over here,

18:18.428 --> 18:21.229
and their names
were Amanda and Alecta.

18:25.302 --> 18:26.634
I'm seeing
the pioneer woman again,

18:26.636 --> 18:31.039
and she's sick,
can't stand up very well...

18:35.845 --> 18:38.914
...burning up so hot
that she felt tired a lot.

18:38.916 --> 18:41.383
She couldn't breathe
at the end,

18:41.385 --> 18:45.387
felt like she was choking,
drowning.

18:45.389 --> 18:49.791
It's more like drowning.

18:49.793 --> 18:52.527
A lot of her symptoms,
like vomiting and diarrhea

18:52.529 --> 18:57.398
and fever, very sad.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.867
How old did she seem to be?

18:58.869 --> 19:01.870
About 17 or 18,
but I think she died here

19:01.872 --> 19:04.005
a long, long, long time ago.

19:04.007 --> 19:06.674
Do you know when this was?

19:06.676 --> 19:10.478
Mid-18, early to mid-1800s.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.080
I think she was buried here.

19:18.821 --> 19:21.556
So before I got to town,
I called the local cops

19:21.558 --> 19:23.758
and asked them to do
some digging for me.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.293
A sergeant just called me back

19:25.295 --> 19:27.162
and says he's got
something good.

19:27.164 --> 19:28.829
Turns out there was
a brutal murder

19:28.831 --> 19:31.900
just 350 feet
from Carissa's front door,

19:31.902 --> 19:34.970
and it all started
with a drunken family fight.

19:41.978 --> 19:43.644
So, Sergeant Kelley,
I appreciate you helping me

19:43.646 --> 19:44.779
out with my investigation.

19:44.781 --> 19:47.048
So you told me there was
a murder

19:47.050 --> 19:49.050
down the block
from my client's house.

19:49.052 --> 19:50.317
What do we know
about this thing?

19:50.319 --> 19:55.123
Well, in May of 1879,
44-year-old Servitus Swartz,

19:55.125 --> 19:57.926
who was running a saloon,
on this day,

19:57.928 --> 20:00.795
his brother-in-law,
Ezekiel Ruse, showed up,

20:00.797 --> 20:03.664
and he was belligerent
and drunk.

20:03.666 --> 20:05.400
- A photo.
- This is Ezekiel?

20:05.402 --> 20:07.068
Correct. That's Ezekiel.

20:07.070 --> 20:09.203
Ezekiel wants to join
a game of cards

20:09.205 --> 20:10.738
with a couple of guys
in the saloon,

20:10.740 --> 20:12.940
and the guys want nothing
to do with him,

20:12.942 --> 20:15.076
so Ezekiel gets agitated,

20:15.078 --> 20:16.745
tries to start a fight
with the guys,

20:16.747 --> 20:19.480
and that's when his
brother-in-law had to step in.

20:19.482 --> 20:20.881
How's that come to murder?

20:20.883 --> 20:23.284
Ezekiel picks up one of
the wooden barstools

20:23.286 --> 20:27.355
and bashes Servitus
over the head,

20:27.357 --> 20:30.358
and a week later, he dies.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.427
So Ezekiel kills his
brother-in-law.

20:32.429 --> 20:33.494
What happens to him?

20:33.496 --> 20:35.630
Well, he got convicted
for murder

20:35.632 --> 20:37.431
and sentenced
to 10 years hard labor

20:37.433 --> 20:42.103
in the Ohio State Penitentiary,
and I got an article on it.

20:42.105 --> 20:44.105
What happens to this guy?
Does he make it out of jail?

20:44.107 --> 20:45.773
Does he die in there?
What happened?

20:45.775 --> 20:48.576
He gets released.
He goes right back to drinking.

20:48.578 --> 20:52.780
His health fades quick,
and in 1893,

20:52.782 --> 20:54.515
he died at the age of 51.

20:54.517 --> 20:56.985
So the stuff that got him
put in jail in the first place,

20:56.987 --> 20:59.387
he goes back to,
and he winds up dying from it.

20:59.389 --> 21:02.457
Correct.

21:02.459 --> 21:06.260
I'm seeing the guy who was
bouncing off the walls again.

21:06.262 --> 21:10.665
I think he looks gruff or rough,
short hair,

21:10.667 --> 21:13.334
which is kind of, like,
a salt-and-pepper,

21:13.336 --> 21:15.803
brown and grays.

21:15.805 --> 21:19.941
I would say
he's in his 50s, 60s.

21:19.943 --> 21:23.544
I'm getting a lot of
drinking, alcohol.

21:23.546 --> 21:27.082
He feels broken and sad

21:27.084 --> 21:30.618
and trying to numb out a lot.

21:35.092 --> 21:40.895
The base of my head hurts a lot
into the left side of my neck.

21:40.897 --> 21:43.464
I'm gonna say that more
than likely,

21:43.466 --> 21:47.168
he drank himself to death,
so that's not good.

21:54.844 --> 21:56.777
For more information
about the show,

21:56.779 --> 21:58.379
and if you need us
to investigate

21:58.381 --> 22:00.181
unexplained activity
in your home...

and we'll help if we can.

22:20.619 --> 22:23.553
So far, I have a client
terrified something in her house

22:23.555 --> 22:26.890
is trying to kill her
and her family on her property

22:26.892 --> 22:29.359
right next door
to an old cemetery,

22:29.361 --> 22:34.431
but I want to see
if there's anything else.

22:34.433 --> 22:37.301
Searching through old records,
I find George Remus,

22:37.303 --> 22:39.837
a notorious bootlegger
who ran a distillery

22:39.839 --> 22:42.706
less than a half mile
from Carissa's house.

22:42.708 --> 22:45.241
So I got to know more
about this bootlegger.

22:45.243 --> 22:47.978
I'm headed over to meet
my old buddy, Lou Hebert.

22:47.980 --> 22:49.313
He's an historical author.

22:49.315 --> 22:53.250
He says this guy ran Lynchburg
with an iron fist,

22:53.252 --> 22:56.253
and anyone who crossed him
paid the ultimate price.

23:00.860 --> 23:03.660
Well, Lou, I appreciate you
helping me out once again.

23:03.662 --> 23:05.128
- Sure.
- Now, you mentioned on the phone

23:05.130 --> 23:06.930
this bootlegger
was a real hard-ass.

23:06.932 --> 23:08.265
What can you tell me
about this guy?

23:08.267 --> 23:10.200
George Remus started out

23:10.202 --> 23:12.869
as a criminal defense attorney
in Chicago

23:12.871 --> 23:16.673
but then decided he wanted to be
maybe a little more successful,

23:16.675 --> 23:19.743
and so he decided
to become a bootlegger.

23:19.745 --> 23:22.079
Now, I know he becomes
pretty famous for that,

23:22.081 --> 23:23.613
so how's he do that?

23:23.615 --> 23:27.550
He buys a bunch of distilleries
in the Ohio and Kentucky area,

23:27.552 --> 23:30.087
and one of the distilleries
he bought in the 1920s

23:30.089 --> 23:33.357
was about 2,500 feet
from your client's property.

23:33.359 --> 23:37.560
This was a major operation,
and in fact, it was so big,

23:37.562 --> 23:39.029
at one time, they can store

23:39.031 --> 23:43.299
as many as 600,000 gallons
of whiskey there.

23:43.301 --> 23:45.568
It's Prohibition.
How did he pull that off?

23:45.570 --> 23:48.505
He becomes a maker
of medicinal alcohol,

23:48.507 --> 23:50.240
which was legal
during Prohibition.

23:50.242 --> 23:53.444
Then a lot of this alcohol
disappears.

23:53.446 --> 23:54.578
It's lost.

23:54.580 --> 23:57.447
It's stolen, and of course,

23:57.449 --> 23:59.315
it makes it way
to the black market,

23:59.317 --> 24:01.584
and George profits from it.

24:01.586 --> 24:03.053
So this guy was
pretty successful.

24:03.055 --> 24:07.724
Yeah, very successful,
made $40 million in three years.

24:07.726 --> 24:09.592
In fact, he was so successful,

24:09.594 --> 24:13.130
he named himself
the King of the Bootleggers.

24:13.132 --> 24:14.531
So you had mentioned
on the phone

24:14.533 --> 24:17.367
also that he ruled
with an iron fist.

24:17.369 --> 24:18.869
Yeah. This is Prohibition.

24:18.871 --> 24:20.471
This is a hardball game,

24:20.473 --> 24:22.606
and some of his business
associates,

24:22.608 --> 24:25.609
yes, ended up
with bullet holes in them.

24:25.611 --> 24:29.413
Everybody knew you don't mess
with George Remus.

24:29.415 --> 24:31.881
All right, so this is obviously
a mug shot of the guy.

24:31.883 --> 24:33.283
When did he get busted?

24:33.285 --> 24:37.487
In 1925, Remus actually goes
to prison for bootlegging.

24:37.489 --> 24:38.755
He gets a two-year sentence.

24:38.757 --> 24:40.557
He's down at the federal
penitentiary in Atlanta.

24:40.559 --> 24:43.293
While he's away,
his wife, Imogene,

24:43.295 --> 24:45.562
decides she's gonna have
an affair,

24:45.564 --> 24:49.365
and insult to injury, he gets
back home, and guess what.

24:49.367 --> 24:51.769
Imogene, his wife,
files for divorce.

24:51.771 --> 24:53.970
So I'm guessing this guy
didn't take that too well.

24:53.972 --> 24:56.973
Well, October 6th, 1927,

24:56.975 --> 25:00.044
George Remus
takes off after her,

25:00.046 --> 25:03.379
gets into a park
in downtown Cincinnati,

25:03.381 --> 25:06.650
pulls her out of a taxi
and shoots her,

25:06.652 --> 25:10.120
broad daylight
in front of everybody.

25:10.122 --> 25:12.122
Everybody sees this,
and does he get arrested?

25:12.124 --> 25:13.123
Yeah. He's arrested.

25:13.125 --> 25:15.125
He actually turns himself
into police.

25:15.127 --> 25:18.462
He pleads temporary insanity,
and guess what?

25:18.464 --> 25:22.933
The jury buys it,
and so he gets off scot-free.

25:22.935 --> 25:25.002
He's a free man.

25:25.004 --> 25:29.672
Okay.

25:29.674 --> 25:32.276
There's that angry
old man again.

25:32.278 --> 25:33.943
Can you describe him more?

25:33.945 --> 25:38.882
White, tall, probably put him
in his late 60s.

25:38.884 --> 25:41.418
I hear a name, George.

25:41.420 --> 25:45.822
He was wearing what looked to me
like a white doctor's coat.

25:45.824 --> 25:49.226
He had money
and was very educated.

25:49.228 --> 25:53.630
To the side of him was, like,
a small ditch little thing

25:53.632 --> 25:57.767
that had some
kind of substance in it.

25:57.769 --> 26:00.570
He's somehow connected
to this small trench

26:00.572 --> 26:04.641
that's flowing
with a dark substance.

26:07.712 --> 26:10.047
It's part of him.

26:10.049 --> 26:12.449
He's telling me to get
the **** off his land.

26:12.451 --> 26:14.118
You know,
he's threatening me, like,

26:14.120 --> 26:18.855
saying something
about running people off before.

26:18.857 --> 26:21.457
He was definitely
a really bad person.

26:29.535 --> 26:33.203
I saw several disturbing things
on my walk, but two stood out --

26:33.205 --> 26:36.006
first, the angry old man.

26:36.008 --> 26:38.408
He's probably in his late 60s

26:38.410 --> 26:42.946
to early 70s, very large eyes.

26:45.150 --> 26:48.785
- His jaw was soft --
- Okay.

26:48.787 --> 26:50.154
...more oval.

26:50.156 --> 26:51.221
Okay.

26:51.223 --> 26:53.223
Next, I describe
the shadow woman

26:53.225 --> 26:56.426
tormenting a living person
in their bedroom.

26:56.428 --> 26:59.296
She has extremely long hair.

26:59.298 --> 27:03.499
She has these red, like,
round, piercing eyes,

27:03.501 --> 27:07.971
and she was preceding
to crawl onto the bed.

27:14.646 --> 27:16.913
Amy, is this what you saw?

27:16.915 --> 27:18.515
Yes. That's what I saw.

27:44.508 --> 27:47.910
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:47.912 --> 27:50.380
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:50.382 --> 27:53.849
and our clients
for the first time.

27:53.851 --> 27:57.653
So, Amy, I'd like you to meet
Carissa and her husband, Terry.

27:57.655 --> 27:59.856
Now, they live here
with Carissa's mother

27:59.858 --> 28:02.125
and their two kids.

28:02.127 --> 28:03.993
Now, this is Eric, who's 15.

28:03.995 --> 28:07.263
This is Keira, who's 7,
and this is her mom.

28:07.265 --> 28:10.533
Activity here is getting
more violent by the day,

28:10.535 --> 28:13.736
and these two don't think it's
safe for anybody to be here,

28:13.738 --> 28:15.871
so unless Amy has got
some questions,

28:15.873 --> 28:20.543
we'll hear about her walk.

28:20.545 --> 28:22.345
So when I first walked in,

28:22.347 --> 28:26.148
I encountered a male
who's deceased,

28:26.150 --> 28:30.152
and he was a mess.

28:30.154 --> 28:32.422
To me, he seemed drunk.

28:32.424 --> 28:34.757
I saw him
kind of running around.

28:34.759 --> 28:37.359
I thought you'd hear him, like,
knocking on the walls,

28:37.361 --> 28:41.831
trying to move things around,
especially in that area.

28:41.833 --> 28:43.566
It sounds like something fell,

28:43.568 --> 28:46.302
and you go look for it,
and nothing fell.

28:47.772 --> 28:49.839
Any idea who this guy might
have been when he was alive?

28:49.841 --> 28:50.974
This is what I got.

28:50.976 --> 28:54.176
In his 50s or 60s,
he had a short kind of buzz cut

28:54.178 --> 28:58.047
with brown and gray hair,
really tan skin

28:58.049 --> 29:00.516
I think from working often
in the sun.

29:00.518 --> 29:04.520
I did get a lot of head
and neck pain with him.

29:04.522 --> 29:06.923
I got that he was drinking
a lot,

29:06.925 --> 29:09.392
trying to numb the pain
he was feeling,

29:09.394 --> 29:14.397
and I kind of was thinking that
maybe he drank himself to death.

29:14.399 --> 29:16.399
So a lot of things
you mentioned reminded me

29:16.401 --> 29:19.401
of a guy that came up
in my research, this guy,

29:19.403 --> 29:20.937
Ezekiel Ruse.

29:20.939 --> 29:22.071
He was a drunk.

29:22.073 --> 29:23.873
He used to live
in this neighborhood.

29:23.875 --> 29:27.276
On May of 1879, he went to a bar
that his brother-in-law

29:27.278 --> 29:30.413
owned and operated
about 350 feet from here.

29:30.415 --> 29:32.614
This guy, Ruse, tried to get
into a card game with two guys,

29:32.616 --> 29:34.817
but he was already drunk
when he got there,

29:34.819 --> 29:36.285
and they wanted nothing
to do with him.

29:36.287 --> 29:38.654
So Ruse tried to pick a fight
with these guys,

29:38.656 --> 29:41.090
and the brother-in-law
intervened.

29:41.092 --> 29:43.626
Ruse winded up cracking
the brother-in-law in the head

29:43.628 --> 29:48.764
with a barstool, fracturing
his skull and killing him.

29:48.766 --> 29:50.433
You said the guy you saw
was working outside,

29:50.435 --> 29:51.701
and he had that tan.

29:51.703 --> 29:54.369
He got convicted and was given
a 10-year sentence

29:54.371 --> 29:56.305
at the Ohio State Penitentiary,

29:56.307 --> 29:58.574
and he was sentenced
to hard labor.

29:58.576 --> 30:00.576
Ruse winded up getting out,

30:00.578 --> 30:03.045
but he started drinking again,
and like the guy you saw,

30:03.047 --> 30:05.047
he winded up
drinking himself to death.

30:05.049 --> 30:08.584
He died in 1893
at the age of 51.

30:08.586 --> 30:10.987
I actually got a photo of Ruse.

30:13.791 --> 30:15.991
Any chance this guy might
have been the drunk you saw?

30:15.993 --> 30:17.726
It's possible, yeah.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Okay. What else?

30:24.002 --> 30:26.335
The next person I encountered,

30:26.337 --> 30:29.338
I'll refer to him
as the drinking man's brother

30:29.340 --> 30:32.274
because they kind
of resembled each other.

30:32.276 --> 30:34.543
He's bad news.

30:34.545 --> 30:39.215
I got that he bullies any living
person he doesn't care for.

30:39.217 --> 30:41.083
There are, I feel, a few ways

30:41.085 --> 30:44.086
that you would be able
to experience him.

30:44.088 --> 30:47.690
The first thing is, he carries
the winter with him,

30:47.692 --> 30:52.294
so it's always ice-cold
around him.

30:52.296 --> 30:54.230
We'd be sitting here
in the house,

30:54.232 --> 30:55.898
and it was very comfortable,

30:55.900 --> 30:59.235
and then all of a sudden,
it's cold.

30:59.237 --> 31:01.770
You may be able to see him.

31:01.772 --> 31:04.773
He's pretty about
showing himself.

31:04.775 --> 31:08.177
Keira has an issue with a guy
in her closet, right?

31:09.647 --> 31:14.717
She said he had on blue pants
and a blue shirt and brown hair,

31:14.719 --> 31:16.585
and she goes,
"I didn't like him.

31:16.587 --> 31:19.455
I didn't like him at all.
He's not nice."

31:19.457 --> 31:22.658
That's interesting.

31:22.660 --> 31:24.126
All right, what else?

31:24.128 --> 31:25.661
Okay.

31:25.663 --> 31:28.197
This was another dead guy,

31:28.199 --> 31:31.000
older male in his 60s or 70s.

31:31.002 --> 31:36.539
I saw him standing with one foot
in, like, a trench.

31:36.541 --> 31:39.341
It's just this dark liquid.

31:39.343 --> 31:41.210
It was obviously important
to him

31:41.212 --> 31:43.612
because he kept his foot in it.

31:43.614 --> 31:47.950
At one point, there was a name,
George, stated.

31:47.952 --> 31:52.154
I got that he was highly
educated, had a lot of money.

31:52.156 --> 31:56.892
He absolutely feels like
he's the boss of this land,

31:56.894 --> 32:02.231
and he does not want
people on his property.

32:02.233 --> 32:06.435
Okay, rich, educated,
dark substance, the name George.

32:06.437 --> 32:08.104
I think I know who you saw.

32:08.106 --> 32:10.272
The guy's name was George Remus.

32:10.274 --> 32:13.041
Now, he was a highly educated
attorney from Chicago

32:13.043 --> 32:14.577
that became the king of
the bootleggers

32:14.579 --> 32:16.245
during Prohibition.

32:16.247 --> 32:17.312
What?

32:17.314 --> 32:19.248
He owned a massive
whiskey distillery

32:19.250 --> 32:21.183
about 2,500 feet from here.

32:21.185 --> 32:23.452
Maybe it was whiskey
he was standing in.

32:23.454 --> 32:26.322
Here's a couple of photos

32:26.324 --> 32:29.191
of how big of an operation
it was back then.

32:29.193 --> 32:31.260
Holy...

32:31.262 --> 32:33.328
What, all of this?

32:33.330 --> 32:36.198
Yeah.

32:36.200 --> 32:40.736
1925, George got locked up on
a two-year bootlegging sentence.

32:40.738 --> 32:42.004
Now, while he was in prison,

32:42.006 --> 32:45.073
his wife, Imogene,
had an affair.

32:45.075 --> 32:47.342
When he got out,
he chased her down

32:47.344 --> 32:50.813
in a public park in Cincinnati
and shot her twice, killing her.

32:55.086 --> 32:57.419
But believe it or not,
he got off scot-free.

32:57.421 --> 33:00.289
I got a photo of George Remus,
but it was when he was younger.

33:02.694 --> 33:04.694
Now you think the guy
you saw was him?

33:04.696 --> 33:08.364
I did have a sketch done of
the individual I encountered.

33:19.244 --> 33:21.777
Yeah, kind of
is in the eyes...

33:21.779 --> 33:23.512
- The eyes, yeah.
- ...and the ears.

33:23.514 --> 33:27.650
Yeah.
The could definitely be him.

33:27.652 --> 33:30.386
I feel like he's ****
looking at me.

33:34.325 --> 33:36.392
Okay. What else?

33:36.394 --> 33:40.329
The next person was a young
woman in her late teens.

33:40.331 --> 33:43.866
She was from back
in the mid-1800s,

33:43.868 --> 33:47.336
very much still in her
death state, unfortunately.

33:47.338 --> 33:50.339
I couldn't exactly get what
she died from,

33:50.341 --> 33:54.276
but I know that she was dealing
with vomiting, nausea,

33:54.278 --> 33:56.612
diarrhea, fever.

33:56.614 --> 33:59.081
I got that she did die
on the property,

33:59.083 --> 34:00.615
and at the time of death,

34:00.617 --> 34:05.153
she felt extremely isolated
and alone.

34:05.155 --> 34:08.157
All right, I got an idea of who
she might be talking about.

34:08.159 --> 34:09.757
Now, right behind
the backyard here

34:09.760 --> 34:13.062
is the oldest pioneer
cemetery in Lynchburg.
Damn.

34:13.063 --> 34:15.965
There are at least 75 bodies
back there,

34:15.967 --> 34:17.498
and most of them
are young people

34:17.501 --> 34:22.705
who died during the cholera
epidemics during the mid-1800s.

34:22.706 --> 34:24.172
Two of the kids buried
back there

34:24.175 --> 34:27.443
are daughters of the Morrow
family that owned the property.

34:27.445 --> 34:30.846
Amanda Morrow died
in 1838 at the age of 24.

34:30.848 --> 34:34.717
Her sister, Alecta,
died in 1842 at the age of 21.

34:34.719 --> 34:37.453
Symptoms of cholera are exactly
what you described --

34:37.455 --> 34:39.722
vomiting, fever, diarrhea.

34:39.724 --> 34:42.791
So would this pioneer woman

34:42.793 --> 34:44.860
do anything to curse her
and the family?

34:44.862 --> 34:46.027
Yes.

34:46.030 --> 34:48.263
So I felt like
when she's around,

34:48.264 --> 34:51.132
you would feel sadness
and depression.

34:51.135 --> 34:54.803
She's always trying to hug
or hold the living,

34:54.804 --> 34:56.938
so she's accidentally
draining their energy

34:56.940 --> 34:59.275
and making them feel sick.

34:59.277 --> 35:01.610
Isn't some of the things she's
talking about happening to Eric?

35:01.612 --> 35:02.945
Yeah.

35:02.947 --> 35:06.015
He was a totally different kid
before we moved here.

35:06.017 --> 35:07.550
He's not the same kid.

35:07.552 --> 35:09.952
He's afraid he's losing
his mind.

35:09.954 --> 35:12.488
Well, I'm sure it feels
like that, yeah.

35:12.490 --> 35:14.356
It would, you know?

35:14.358 --> 35:17.559
It's possible that this
young woman went to him

35:17.561 --> 35:21.163
and maybe has now
formed cords into him.

35:27.171 --> 35:30.639
Now, I want to get
to the biggest threat.

35:30.641 --> 35:32.641
She had been murdered

35:32.643 --> 35:35.044
and buried
somewhere close to here.

35:35.046 --> 35:39.648
She's extremely angry
about what happened to her,

35:39.650 --> 35:42.651
and unfortunately,
she takes it out

35:42.653 --> 35:45.921
on any person
that comes around.

35:45.923 --> 35:47.990
There were two main ways
that I saw her.

35:47.992 --> 35:51.060
One was in the shape
of a shadow figure

35:51.062 --> 35:56.265
but female with red eyes,
and then, also,

35:56.267 --> 36:00.469
she becomes, like,
looks like a deformed spider.

36:00.471 --> 36:01.604
When she said the red eyes,

36:01.606 --> 36:03.539
I looked at you right away.

36:03.541 --> 36:08.744
I've seen her twice in
Keira's room, the same window.

36:08.746 --> 36:13.482
It's a black shadow
and the two red eyes.

36:14.952 --> 36:17.486
Now, she mentioned
a smaller shadow figure.

36:17.488 --> 36:19.555
You described that to me also.

36:19.557 --> 36:21.690
I kept seeing something out
of the corner of my eye

36:21.692 --> 36:25.293
running around the floor,
running around the ceiling.

36:25.295 --> 36:27.963
She can touch, push,
and shove.

36:27.965 --> 36:30.633
She took one of the fingers
and wrapped it around my throat

36:30.635 --> 36:32.501
and was, like,
strangling me.

36:32.503 --> 36:37.973
I got pinned to the wall
and just felt like somebody

36:37.975 --> 36:41.777
had their hands
around my throat,

36:41.779 --> 36:43.378
and I couldn't breathe,

36:43.380 --> 36:47.650
and it was just a scratch
that come down and like this.

36:47.652 --> 36:49.785
- Okay.
- I actually have a photo.

36:49.787 --> 36:53.122
It's the weirdest scratch
I've ever seen.

36:53.124 --> 36:54.857
Interesting. Okay.

36:54.859 --> 36:56.792
Totally makes sense.

36:56.794 --> 37:00.662
She can affect
the living emotionally,

37:00.664 --> 37:03.065
very angry and then very sad.

37:03.067 --> 37:05.468
It's, like, one or the other.

37:05.470 --> 37:10.138
I will be fine
and then in such

37:10.140 --> 37:13.008
a violent rage

37:13.010 --> 37:17.612
that I want
to tear somebody apart.

37:17.614 --> 37:19.548
I'll snap at her for no reason.

37:19.550 --> 37:21.817
20 minutes later,
you forget about it.

37:21.819 --> 37:24.486
You don't even know
why you even snapped.

37:24.488 --> 37:26.889
I saw her doing something
really dangerous

37:26.891 --> 37:29.090
in one of
the bedrooms down here.

37:29.092 --> 37:31.494
She's crawling onto this person

37:31.496 --> 37:34.964
and just, like,
melding with them.

37:34.966 --> 37:38.433
I know that this person
specifically is suffering

37:38.435 --> 37:40.102
due to that.

37:40.104 --> 37:41.437
Didn't your mom wake up
one night,

37:41.439 --> 37:42.771
and there was a shadow
figure standing over her?

37:42.773 --> 37:44.573
Standing over top of her.

37:44.575 --> 37:47.843
This was the day before
I put her in the hospital.

37:49.313 --> 37:52.314
So I did have a sketch done.

37:52.316 --> 37:53.515
Okay.

38:18.743 --> 38:20.809
I saw that if it's allowed
to continue

38:20.811 --> 38:26.081
that she would definitely end
up killing this person.

38:26.083 --> 38:28.083
Okay.

38:28.085 --> 38:30.419
Can...

38:30.421 --> 38:31.353
Yeah, sure.

38:39.162 --> 38:41.963
This is the most awful
thing I've ever seen in my life.

39:03.820 --> 39:05.887
Now, Carissa, you told me
your biggest fear

39:05.889 --> 39:08.823
was that something here
was trying to kill your mother.

39:08.825 --> 39:11.359
Unfortunately,
you were 100% right,

39:11.361 --> 39:13.628
and the way it sounds,
this place isn't safe

39:13.630 --> 39:16.898
for any of you guys,
so now it's time to see

39:16.900 --> 39:18.566
if there's anything
you can do about that.

39:18.568 --> 39:20.235
For that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

39:23.707 --> 39:26.441
You definitely have a choice
to make here.

39:26.443 --> 39:29.444
One option is to move,

39:29.446 --> 39:33.114
but if you decide to stay,

39:33.116 --> 39:37.519
you would need to vacate
the premises as soon as possible

39:37.521 --> 39:40.255
until a group of people

39:40.257 --> 39:44.325
can come here
to deal with the situation.

39:44.327 --> 39:46.727
The first thing that
they would do

39:46.729 --> 39:50.332
would be to remove
the shadow woman.

39:50.334 --> 39:55.269
This is gonna be quite
a struggle for them, honestly.

39:55.271 --> 39:58.272
There's maybe a 75% chance

39:58.274 --> 40:03.278
that they would be able
to contain and fully remove her.

40:03.280 --> 40:06.481
The second thing they would do
is call the dead men

40:06.483 --> 40:12.286
so that then they can proceed
to remove each of them.

40:12.288 --> 40:14.155
So you're talking about
the drunk guy, Ezekiel,

40:14.157 --> 40:16.757
and his brother?
- Yes.

40:16.759 --> 40:18.893
Will they get rid
of George Remus, as well?

40:18.895 --> 40:22.297
No. They would have to go

40:22.299 --> 40:26.367
to Cincinnati to do that.

40:26.369 --> 40:28.302
That's where he killed
his wife.

40:28.304 --> 40:31.906
Yes.

40:31.908 --> 40:37.512
Next, your son would need
to have the cords cut

40:37.514 --> 40:42.050
that the pioneer girl
has placed inside of him.

40:42.052 --> 40:44.052
It's way worse than I thought.

40:44.054 --> 40:47.655
Well, if you lived here, would
you try to fix this and stay?

40:47.657 --> 40:52.393
I would
probably move, yeah.

40:52.395 --> 40:56.998
It's a lot of decision-making
right there.

40:57.000 --> 41:01.202
Not really.

41:01.204 --> 41:05.273
I don't feel like it's worth
staying here.

41:05.275 --> 41:10.945
That chance is too big.

41:10.947 --> 41:14.215
You know, I'm ready to move
as far as I can.

41:14.217 --> 41:16.451
A building can be replaced.

41:16.453 --> 41:20.154
My kids and my mom cannot.

41:20.156 --> 41:24.358
It sucks, but on the other hand,
it's doable.

41:24.360 --> 41:25.493
Yeah.

41:25.495 --> 41:29.497
We can do it as long
as we do it together.

41:29.499 --> 41:33.234
I wish I had better news
for Carissa and Terry,

41:33.236 --> 41:35.570
but moving
is their best option.

41:35.572 --> 41:37.171
Hopefully, they take my advice,

41:37.173 --> 41:40.441
leave this house behind and get
a fresh start somewhere new.

41:44.581 --> 41:46.580
When you guys left,

41:46.582 --> 41:50.652
things ramped to a whole
new level of dangerous.

41:50.654 --> 41:52.987
It was like everything was
stirred-up to the maximum.

41:52.989 --> 41:56.124
The shadow woman
had taken me over,

41:56.126 --> 42:00.461
and her intentions were to kill
my mom and have me do it.

42:00.463 --> 42:04.199
We had a group of guys
called Spirit Mechanics,

42:04.201 --> 42:08.469
came in and helped us out.

42:08.471 --> 42:12.140
I had to actually
have an exorcism.

42:12.142 --> 42:14.142
I feel completely different.

42:14.144 --> 42:17.211
The rages are gone.
The house is lighter.

42:17.213 --> 42:19.147
It's cleaner. It's brighter.

42:19.149 --> 42:21.749
Everybody is getting along,

42:21.751 --> 42:23.817
and we're finally
getting back to normal.

42:23.819 --> 42:25.486
So thank you, guys.

42:25.488 --> 42:28.089
Thank you for all your help.
Thank you for coming.

42:28.091 --> 42:29.157
Thank you for saving
my family.
