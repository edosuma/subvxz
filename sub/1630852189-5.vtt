00:00.375 --> 00:02.400
It's a family home.
My family home.

00:02.675 --> 00:05.325
I'm afraid that's no longer true.

00:05.450 --> 00:07.450
I'm sorry
things turned out like that...

00:07.725 --> 00:10.250
..but think of it as a fresh start.

00:10.375 --> 00:13.625
I've made a complete mess
of things with Rachel.

00:14.300 --> 00:15.725
I don't know how to fix it.

00:16.225 --> 00:18.600
I may not be the best person
to offer advice...

00:19.250 --> 00:21.375
..but don't give up on her, Cadi.

00:21.650 --> 00:24.225
I'm sorry Ifan's dead, I really am.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.300
I had nothing to do with it.

00:26.575 --> 00:28.600
(HANNAH) Sion, is that you?

00:30.325 --> 00:31.400
Tell me.

00:31.675 --> 00:32.675
Who else knew?

00:33.175 --> 00:35.250
I cannot and I will not tell you.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.600
ENGINE ROARS

01:37.150 --> 01:38.625
HE SOBS

01:52.150 --> 01:54.150
CAR HORN

02:18.425 --> 02:20.425
HE SCREAMS

02:35.125 --> 02:37.125
SHE SIGHS

03:26.125 --> 03:28.125
FOOTSTEPS

03:32.625 --> 03:34.425
Caught red-handed.

03:36.125 --> 03:38.375
Want some help with that wine?

03:43.575 --> 03:46.300
Still not sleeping?
No.

03:49.175 --> 03:52.225
You and Rhyds are OK though?
Um, yes.

03:54.250 --> 03:57.300
I've just got to get back
into a routine...

03:57.425 --> 03:59.475
..with Rhyds, Lois and Twm.

04:01.625 --> 04:02.625
I don't know.

04:03.125 --> 04:05.375
It's like I lost my place
when I left.

04:06.650 --> 04:09.250
I'm just trying to find it again.

04:10.675 --> 04:12.650
No, you're doing great.

04:17.475 --> 04:18.650
So...

04:20.575 --> 04:22.575
..are you going to tell me?

04:23.225 --> 04:25.300
How things are with Rachel?

04:28.450 --> 04:29.700
Not great.

04:32.675 --> 04:35.175
I've messed things up I think.

04:36.625 --> 04:38.625
SHE SIGHS

04:39.375 --> 04:40.625
I really miss her.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.200
I never meant to hurt her.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.600
I hadn't realised...

04:52.600 --> 04:55.125
..how much it would hurt me.

05:01.500 --> 05:04.675
You know, Rhydian and I
have always argued.

05:05.175 --> 05:07.650
Always wanted different things.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.575
I remember going to see Dad once,
after an argument...

05:12.700 --> 05:17.700
..and he told me that he and mam
used to argue quite a lot.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.200
I know!

05:19.675 --> 05:22.700
He also said the only thing
you can do...

05:24.300 --> 05:26.550
..is get up again in the morning...

05:26.675 --> 05:29.475
..and choose each other again.

05:30.650 --> 05:32.275
Every day.

05:35.275 --> 05:36.550
If you do that...

05:37.650 --> 05:39.725
..things will work out fine.

05:42.600 --> 05:47.150
Maybe we're just on different paths.
Or maybe that's an excuse?

05:48.225 --> 05:50.600
Saying things like that
to yourself...

05:50.725 --> 05:54.500
..just allows you
to keep doing what you're doing.

05:55.150 --> 05:57.550
It allows Rachel to be a dream.

05:59.575 --> 06:02.700
Thing is, Cads,
dreams can be really cold.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.725
They lead to empty beds and regrets.

06:09.275 --> 06:10.650
Isn't it better to know?

06:12.450 --> 06:14.550
Even if things don't work out...

06:20.725 --> 06:22.625
I'd better go back up.

06:31.675 --> 06:33.425
KISSES HER TENDERLY

06:34.250 --> 06:35.500
I love you.

09:06.725 --> 09:08.725
DOOR OPENS

09:16.725 --> 09:19.200
You shouldn't be in here, Sion.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.350
You disturb the birds.

09:49.425 --> 09:50.600
What are you doing?

09:50.725 --> 09:53.425
The hawk. I told you about it.

09:55.150 --> 09:56.300
I have to get rid of it.

09:56.425 --> 09:58.725
Hannah said that
this is what her dad used to do.

10:00.325 --> 10:02.500
She said it was kinder this way.

10:05.700 --> 10:08.350
I don't know if I can do this, Sion.

10:08.475 --> 10:10.375
Hey... it's OK.

10:12.300 --> 10:15.675
Sometimes, we have to do things
we don't want to do.

10:18.525 --> 10:20.275
But it's for the best...

10:22.125 --> 10:24.500
..and there's no one to blame
for that.

10:25.175 --> 10:28.350
It's just the way it works out
sometimes.

10:30.125 --> 10:34.325
Why did you sleep in the shed?
I was home late.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.650
I didn't want to disturb you.

10:38.150 --> 10:40.150
Where were you last night?

10:42.375 --> 10:43.400
Does it matter?

10:49.175 --> 10:51.650
You're big enough
to look after yourself, aren't you?

10:52.300 --> 10:53.550
Of course.

11:00.350 --> 11:03.600
Are you going to the woods now?
Once I've done this.

11:13.300 --> 11:14.675
Caru ti, Glyn.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.525
You smell! Go and have a shower.

12:40.175 --> 12:42.275
Cadi. Can I have a word?

12:48.375 --> 12:50.425
I wanted to give you this in person.

12:50.700 --> 12:52.700
Your formal transfer notice.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.200
It arrived this morning.

12:56.250 --> 12:58.675
Aren't you going to open it?
I'll do it later.

12:59.350 --> 13:02.425
How would you feel about
being on the interview panel...

13:02.550 --> 13:04.300
..to find your replacement?

13:05.175 --> 13:09.475
Your insight would be invaluable
and I know you want to make sure...

13:10.125 --> 13:12.700
..we find the right partner
for Vaughan.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.125
Yes, if you think it'd help.

13:15.250 --> 13:16.250
Of course.

13:16.525 --> 13:17.525
Thank you.

13:57.450 --> 13:58.600
Hello?

14:34.175 --> 14:36.175
SHE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR

14:39.200 --> 14:40.200
Hello?

14:43.400 --> 14:44.575
It's Lea.

14:52.400 --> 14:53.525
Hello?

14:55.400 --> 14:57.400
SHE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR

14:57.650 --> 15:00.175
Sorry about yesterday, I just...

15:01.525 --> 15:03.150
..panicked.

15:50.225 --> 15:51.350
No joy?

15:52.175 --> 15:53.200
I don't know.

15:54.425 --> 15:58.425
I was here last night trying to
find something... anything.

16:00.425 --> 16:03.200
I keep trying to
reconfigure the pieces...

16:03.475 --> 16:05.625
..hoping something new comes up.

16:06.625 --> 16:08.650
That's the definition of madness.

16:09.150 --> 16:13.175
Doing the same thing over and over
and hoping for a different result.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.500
Hey! You'd better be nice to me.

16:15.625 --> 16:19.475
Lynn just asked me
to help find your new partner.

16:19.600 --> 16:23.150
Whoever it is,
it can't be worse than the last one!

16:23.675 --> 16:24.675
KNOCK ON WINDOW

16:25.325 --> 16:27.525
Sorry for interrupting.

16:28.125 --> 16:31.700
A body's been found on the estate.
It looks like an assault.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.350
Got the address?
Yes.

16:37.600 --> 16:40.400
I've dispatched a unit to the scene.
Thank you.

16:40.675 --> 16:42.175
Let's go.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.500
DOOR SLAMS SHUT

17:40.650 --> 17:43.300
I'll join you in a minute.
OK.

17:46.700 --> 17:48.200
Ma'am.

18:49.625 --> 18:53.625
Any signs of a forced entry?
No.

18:54.575 --> 18:57.300
Weapon?
Not obvious.

18:58.675 --> 19:02.325
Do you think there's a link
with the Ifan Williams case?

19:05.600 --> 19:08.200
KNOCK ON DOOR
Ma'am. Path's here.

19:15.500 --> 19:16.725
I'll leave you to it.

19:25.325 --> 19:26.450
Hi.

19:27.350 --> 19:28.350
Morning.

19:31.325 --> 19:33.175
What time was it called in?

19:35.700 --> 19:37.350
About an hour ago.

19:38.525 --> 19:41.225
I need you
to clear the scene for me.

19:46.175 --> 19:47.200
He's all yours.

19:53.350 --> 19:55.350
SHE SIGHS

20:07.600 --> 20:08.600
Lea Pryce?

20:08.725 --> 20:09.725
Remember her?

20:10.225 --> 20:11.300
She called it in.

20:11.425 --> 20:13.675
She still lives at the same address.

20:15.450 --> 20:16.450
Small world.

20:18.575 --> 20:20.625
OK, I'll head over there now.

20:21.275 --> 20:24.625
See if you can get a list
of his parishioners.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.525
We should start there.

21:09.225 --> 21:11.575
I'm so sorry
you saw what you saw today.

21:14.275 --> 21:16.325
He came to see me last night.

21:19.250 --> 21:20.675
I didn't even let him in.

21:23.375 --> 21:25.625
I left him standing on the doorstep.

21:27.325 --> 21:29.525
Do you remember what time that was?

21:31.225 --> 21:32.675
Around 10-ish.

21:35.150 --> 21:38.475
And that's the last time
you saw him or heard from him?

21:39.150 --> 21:42.200
I woke up this morning
to this... this mess.

21:45.300 --> 21:46.300
I don't know.

21:48.650 --> 21:50.700
Something just clicked.

21:52.575 --> 21:54.450
I can't do this any more.

21:57.325 --> 21:59.650
I wanted to take him something...

22:01.575 --> 22:05.675
..and promise him I wouldn't keep
tripping myself up any more.

22:07.175 --> 22:10.275
Can you think of anyone
who had a reason to do this to him?

22:11.125 --> 22:12.125
No.

22:13.225 --> 22:14.350
No...

22:17.250 --> 22:18.575
He was a good man.

22:22.175 --> 22:23.550
He was trying to help me.

22:26.500 --> 22:29.125
They want to
kick me out of this house.

22:29.425 --> 22:30.500
I was so angry...

22:32.150 --> 22:33.350
..but not with him.

22:33.475 --> 22:34.475
Lea...

22:35.125 --> 22:38.300
..you couldn't have known
this would happen.

22:39.575 --> 22:42.300
They keep saying
it's just me here now.

22:42.425 --> 22:45.325
It's like they're forcing me out.

22:46.450 --> 22:47.700
Mali.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.450
Dad.

22:52.650 --> 22:55.325
They're what I'm holding on to.

22:56.200 --> 22:59.125
I can cope
if I can feel them around me.

23:02.325 --> 23:03.425
Sometimes...

23:03.550 --> 23:07.150
..I think we confuse places
with people.

23:08.700 --> 23:12.675
Those memories you have
will never be taken away from you.

23:15.200 --> 23:18.325
That's what Father McEwan said.
He was right.

23:22.700 --> 23:26.300
It feels like sometimes death
and these things...

23:28.225 --> 23:31.550
..it's like they follow me around
or I attract them.

23:31.675 --> 23:33.700
No. That's not true.

23:37.150 --> 23:39.350
Father McEwan saw the value in you.

23:41.350 --> 23:43.225
He wanted you to do well.

23:44.400 --> 23:45.625
I didn't deserve it.

23:46.675 --> 23:49.325
What you've got to remember is...

23:49.600 --> 23:51.650
..you went there this morning.

23:52.150 --> 23:54.250
You'd made your decision.

23:55.250 --> 23:58.225
He'd be devastated
if this derailed you.

24:02.175 --> 24:05.475
I'd say it was even more of a reason
to keep going.

25:06.475 --> 25:08.350
PHONE RINGS

25:09.175 --> 25:11.300
Hiya.
(RACHEL) Hey.

25:11.425 --> 25:12.700
Sorry, I had to leave.

25:13.200 --> 25:16.700
It's OK, listen...
I was hoping we could talk.

25:17.500 --> 25:20.175
Actually, it's about the case.

25:21.375 --> 25:22.625
Of course...

25:23.125 --> 25:25.225
So far, everything points to...

25:25.525 --> 25:27.250
..a strangulation.

25:27.375 --> 25:30.700
Bruising to the front of the neck,
broken cartilage.

25:31.200 --> 25:33.200
It's... well, I have to say...

25:33.325 --> 25:37.300
..it's very similar to the injuries
found on Ifan Williams.

25:37.600 --> 25:41.700
Except, in this case, there are
no apparent defensive wounds.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.400
Nothing to suggest he fought back.

25:46.225 --> 25:50.250
He didn't offer any resistance?
It seems not and that's unusual.

25:50.675 --> 25:55.375
I'd expect to see injuries
to the arms and the hands...

25:56.700 --> 25:59.425
..unless the attack
came from behind.

25:59.550 --> 26:01.300
But that's not the case?

26:02.625 --> 26:04.675
The lesions are on the larynx.

26:05.425 --> 26:09.425
His attacker was standing
right in front of him, face to face.

26:10.700 --> 26:12.275
Does that help?

26:13.300 --> 26:15.350
I'm not sure... maybe.

26:16.125 --> 26:18.450
Anyway, I thought you should know.

26:19.225 --> 26:21.425
Thank you. I really appreciate it.

26:22.575 --> 26:24.550
OK... I'd better go.
Rach?

26:27.600 --> 26:28.625
Think about it.

26:30.675 --> 26:32.350
About us talking.

26:37.550 --> 26:38.675
OK.

26:45.125 --> 26:46.250
Come with me.

26:51.725 --> 26:53.275
Where are we going?

26:53.400 --> 26:58.125
As I see it, only one man connects
Ifan Williams and Father McEwan.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.250
Let's see if he'll talk.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.425
SHE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR

28:18.525 --> 28:19.525
Mr O'Connell.

28:20.175 --> 28:21.525
Can we have a word?

28:23.550 --> 28:24.550
Of course.

28:28.350 --> 28:31.275
I'm afraid we've got some bad news.

28:31.575 --> 28:34.500
We found Father McEwan this morning.

28:35.725 --> 28:37.475
Somebody attacked him.

28:38.525 --> 28:41.575
I'm sorry to have to tell you
that he's dead.

28:43.475 --> 28:44.500
No...!

28:45.625 --> 28:48.725
He told us
that you used to attend his church?

28:49.375 --> 28:50.375
Yes.

28:51.650 --> 28:54.475
Can you tell us
where you were last night?

28:56.225 --> 28:57.225
I was here.

28:58.700 --> 29:01.575
A neighbour and I
have been repairing a fence...

29:02.225 --> 29:03.650
..behind the house here.

29:04.150 --> 29:05.475
We worked quite late.

29:05.600 --> 29:07.725
Until the sun went down anyway.

29:08.225 --> 29:10.375
Can your neighbour confirm that?

29:13.675 --> 29:14.700
Yes, of course.

29:17.150 --> 29:19.625
We're looking at
a possible connection...

29:20.125 --> 29:22.200
..to the death of Ifan Williams.

29:24.650 --> 29:27.275
We now have two dead men...

29:27.400 --> 29:30.175
..and both have links to you.

29:31.500 --> 29:34.125
What are you trying to say?
I'm just asking.

29:35.225 --> 29:38.150
Just asking if you can
think of anything...

29:38.275 --> 29:41.700
..that might connect Father McEwan
and Ifan Williams?

29:53.375 --> 29:55.325
Oh, that bloody boy!

29:56.725 --> 30:00.525
That stupid bloody boy!
Mr O'Connell, are you OK?

30:06.600 --> 30:08.350
What happened, Dafydd?

30:25.575 --> 30:27.125
It was years ago...

30:27.375 --> 30:29.325
..when I was on the farm.

30:32.350 --> 30:35.625
Ifan was throwing his weight around
in the village.

30:36.125 --> 30:37.250
Drinking.

30:38.275 --> 30:41.500
There was a group of them.
Up to no good.

30:44.225 --> 30:46.275
Mair would stay up all night...

30:46.400 --> 30:49.350
..hoping he'd come home safe,
in one piece.

30:50.600 --> 30:52.625
He always did, of course...

30:54.475 --> 30:56.500
..with a black eye...

30:59.275 --> 31:01.375
..and that attitude of his.

31:01.650 --> 31:04.625
Dai and Mair went somewhere one day.

31:05.125 --> 31:08.175
They asked me
to keep an eye on things.

31:11.125 --> 31:13.700
I was there late,
about to go home.

31:15.125 --> 31:17.700
I walked into the shed to lock up.

31:22.125 --> 31:23.225
I saw Ifan.

31:25.375 --> 31:26.625
He had a jerrycan.

31:30.175 --> 31:31.600
He stank of petrol.

31:33.475 --> 31:36.375
He was drunk.
Wasn't making much sense.

31:38.325 --> 31:41.625
I told him to get inside the house,
out of the way.

31:42.125 --> 31:43.600
I thought nothing of it...

31:47.275 --> 31:49.125
..until the next day...

31:53.125 --> 31:55.525
..when I heard about the fire...

31:57.425 --> 31:59.475
..and the woman who died.

32:04.225 --> 32:06.300
Why didn't you tell the police?

32:08.200 --> 32:09.325
Why?!

32:10.225 --> 32:11.550
How could I know?

32:17.450 --> 32:19.300
I didn't know for certain.

32:19.575 --> 32:22.725
Ifan carried on
like there was nothing wrong.

32:25.125 --> 32:29.575
How could someone behave like that
if they'd done something so awful?

32:30.375 --> 32:34.625
I walked to the farm a hundred times
to tell his mam and dad...

32:35.125 --> 32:37.175
..but I turned back every time.

32:41.375 --> 32:45.400
So you told the priest?
Father McEwan?

32:46.600 --> 32:48.150
Yes.

32:49.150 --> 32:51.475
I sat there, in confession.

32:52.300 --> 32:53.725
I told him everything...

32:56.225 --> 32:57.500
..and he absolved me.

32:59.725 --> 33:01.675
And that was the end of it?

33:03.575 --> 33:06.400
He told me to leave it behind.

33:07.600 --> 33:10.650
He gave me permission to bury it...

33:13.250 --> 33:14.500
..but...

33:15.625 --> 33:19.300
..it's still here,
eating away at me.

33:22.450 --> 33:26.675
Father McEwan
didn't absolve me of my sins.

33:28.475 --> 33:30.650
He chained them to me.

34:53.300 --> 34:54.550
BANGING ON THE DOOR

34:54.675 --> 34:56.400
(HANNAH) Sion?

34:56.525 --> 34:58.175
BANGING ON THE DOOR

34:58.300 --> 35:02.400
I know you're there, Sion.
I've still got my key.

35:11.575 --> 35:13.375
What do you want?

35:14.400 --> 35:17.175
Jesus, Sion, what are you doing?

35:18.375 --> 35:20.700
Sion, you need to tell me
what's going on.

35:21.200 --> 35:23.600
Nothing's going on.
Don't bullshit me.

35:23.725 --> 35:28.325
You told me to stay out of your life
now I need you to stay out of mine.

35:29.450 --> 35:30.650
Are you in trouble?

35:31.300 --> 35:32.550
You need to go.

35:34.425 --> 35:35.650
This isn't like you.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.600
What's happened?
Nothing's fucking happened!

35:39.250 --> 35:41.575
You're the one
who turned up here shouting.

35:42.225 --> 35:44.400
Sion, please, just...
Just shut up!

35:52.175 --> 35:53.650
Where's Glyn?

35:56.675 --> 35:57.700
Out.

35:58.200 --> 36:01.450
Why was the door locked
and you're sitting in the dark?

36:01.575 --> 36:03.300
Will you just fucking go?

36:03.575 --> 36:05.650
No! I won't just fucking go!

36:19.225 --> 36:20.375
I'm sorry.

36:24.225 --> 36:26.275
You can't help me, Han.

36:27.350 --> 36:28.650
You can't.

36:32.525 --> 36:35.550
We can talk about this,
whatever it is.

36:35.675 --> 36:37.425
We can talk about it.

36:37.550 --> 36:39.550
What do you want from me?

36:45.425 --> 36:46.425
Please, Sion.

36:49.300 --> 36:50.550
Sion?

36:56.350 --> 36:57.600
I have to ask you this.

36:57.725 --> 37:00.175
I don't want to but I need to know.

37:03.725 --> 37:05.600
Was it you?

37:07.300 --> 37:09.300
Did you kill that man?

37:15.550 --> 37:17.550
Do you think it was me?

37:18.725 --> 37:20.475
I don't know.

37:21.675 --> 37:23.675
I need you to tell me.

37:27.150 --> 37:29.150
You've changed, Sion.

37:32.425 --> 37:33.675
Have I?

37:36.725 --> 37:40.375
Or have I always been like this
but you refused to see it?

37:43.475 --> 37:45.450
If you've done anything...

37:45.575 --> 37:47.500
..Glyn would...

37:49.500 --> 37:53.125
You'd be leaving him
and he's already lost his mother.

37:53.250 --> 37:55.150
How could you do that to him?

38:04.400 --> 38:06.525
I haven't done anything wrong.

38:09.275 --> 38:10.400
Nothing.

38:13.525 --> 38:15.525
I need you to go.

38:16.475 --> 38:17.600
Now.

38:20.150 --> 38:23.450
And you've got to promise
to never think about us again.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.225
I did it.

39:51.325 --> 39:53.325
It's alright, Glyn.

39:53.650 --> 39:56.275
It had to be done, didn't it?

39:58.575 --> 40:00.150
I saw Hannah.

40:00.275 --> 40:01.725
What did she want?

40:02.600 --> 40:04.475
She was worried about you.

40:05.275 --> 40:06.275
About me.

40:06.525 --> 40:08.525
And she was right.

40:11.200 --> 40:14.150
We need to stick together, don't we?

40:16.500 --> 40:17.600
Ti a fi.

40:24.300 --> 40:26.175
It was for the best, Glyn.

40:30.525 --> 40:32.700
The hawk was a threat, wasn't it?

40:35.575 --> 40:37.450
You fixed the problem.

40:39.525 --> 40:43.300
That's what you do
when you have to look after things.

40:47.125 --> 40:48.600
Are you OK, Sion?

40:57.650 --> 40:59.725
I know it's been difficult...

41:03.525 --> 41:06.125
..but I'm going to fix things.

41:09.450 --> 41:11.325
For both of us.

41:27.725 --> 41:29.250
Cadi?

41:29.375 --> 41:30.375
Hi.

41:30.500 --> 41:33.525
They told me you were
on your way back.

41:34.175 --> 41:35.575
DNA profiling from earlier.

41:36.225 --> 41:38.325
They owed me a rush-order.

41:38.450 --> 41:40.475
You could have phoned.

41:41.125 --> 41:42.600
I wanted to hand it to you.

41:43.250 --> 41:44.550
What's the top line?

41:44.675 --> 41:47.500
The secondary DNA from the priest...

41:48.150 --> 41:51.475
..matches DNA scraped
in the Ifan Williams case.

41:51.600 --> 41:55.525
Confirming the same assailant?
Yes. It's safe to say that.

41:57.125 --> 41:58.275
Thank you.

42:03.125 --> 42:04.625
I should have talked to you.

42:07.300 --> 42:08.475
I screwed up.

42:09.250 --> 42:10.350
Look...

42:10.475 --> 42:13.125
..if moving away is what you need...

42:13.400 --> 42:15.275
..I won't ask you to stay.

42:15.400 --> 42:17.300
I wouldn't do that to you.

42:19.500 --> 42:21.400
I really have to go.

42:21.525 --> 42:23.225
Go on.

42:36.575 --> 42:38.450
Where are we going, Sion?

42:40.700 --> 42:42.575
On an adventure.

43:47.650 --> 43:50.425
OK, this is what we know.

43:52.175 --> 43:53.625
Ifan Williams...

43:54.125 --> 43:55.125
..killed.

43:55.250 --> 43:57.125
Death by asphyxiation.

43:57.400 --> 43:58.400
Farmer.

43:58.525 --> 44:00.275
Deep in debt.

44:00.400 --> 44:01.725
He's in the system.

44:02.225 --> 44:04.375
Petty stuff, going way back.

44:04.625 --> 44:07.500
Teenage troublemaker,
nothing exceptional.

44:08.150 --> 44:11.675
We now know that around this time
there was a terrible tragedy.

44:13.350 --> 44:15.375
A house fire. Arson.

44:16.525 --> 44:19.225
Branwen Thomas. Auxiliary nurse.

44:19.350 --> 44:20.400
Died in the blaze.

44:20.675 --> 44:24.175
Red diesel accelerant.
Impossible to trace.

44:24.450 --> 44:26.250
No clear motive.

44:26.375 --> 44:28.400
No previous threat to life.

44:28.525 --> 44:30.250
The case is unsolved.

44:30.375 --> 44:32.600
Nothing at the time
that would point to...

44:33.625 --> 44:34.725
..Ifan Williams.

44:35.225 --> 44:36.500
Twenty years later...

44:37.150 --> 44:38.725
..and it's a different story.

44:39.225 --> 44:40.625
There was a connection.

44:41.125 --> 44:43.200
Caught in the middle of it is...

44:44.425 --> 44:47.175
..Father McEwan,
found dead this morning.

44:47.450 --> 44:49.125
And just confirmed...

44:49.250 --> 44:51.600
..the same assailant
as Ifan Williams.

44:56.275 --> 44:58.125
Where does this take us now?

44:58.400 --> 45:00.150
Back to our dead nurse...

45:00.275 --> 45:02.350
..and her two sons that survived.

45:02.625 --> 45:06.250
They spent some time
in foster care.

45:07.200 --> 45:09.375
They were nearing adulthood...

45:10.725 --> 45:13.225
..so they got on the housing list.

45:13.500 --> 45:16.325
They'll both be
in their thirties now.

45:21.175 --> 45:23.350
One of the brothers, Glyn Thomas...

45:24.425 --> 45:26.425
..seen in this photo...

45:26.550 --> 45:31.225
..was at the same school and
in the same class as Ifan Williams.

45:31.500 --> 45:34.675
Glyn Thomas and his brother...

45:37.650 --> 45:39.300
..Sion Thomas.

45:39.575 --> 45:43.350
This picture was taken
shortly before Glyn was moved...

45:43.500 --> 45:45.700
..to a special
English medium school.

45:46.200 --> 45:48.200
Sion stayed, so this is our focus.

45:49.350 --> 45:51.575
Their last known address is local.

45:52.225 --> 45:55.500
It might be out of date
but that's where we start.

45:56.150 --> 45:58.400
We were called out to these boys
a few days ago.

45:58.675 --> 46:01.400
Aggro with one of their neighbours.

46:01.525 --> 46:05.675
We need the closest unit
to the house right away.

46:06.175 --> 46:08.175
We'll meet them there.

47:19.675 --> 47:21.675
Police! Open the door!

47:22.600 --> 47:24.600
Police! Stand back from the door.
