WEBVTT

00:05.564 --> 00:07.247
You know, when you see your
reflection in the floor,

00:07.248 --> 00:09.198
that's how you know it's done.

00:09.232 --> 00:11.900
I'm nervous. Cleaning calms me.

00:11.935 --> 00:14.248
Come on, Nora. Tommy's coming home.

00:14.249 --> 00:16.033
That's a good thing.

00:16.068 --> 00:19.103
Don't! Don't step on
my wet floor. Please.

00:19.137 --> 00:21.222
Put the flowers over there.

00:22.724 --> 00:24.208
And, Saul.

00:24.243 --> 00:25.359
Mm-hmm.

00:25.394 --> 00:27.662
Tommy said he had
a surprise for us.

00:27.713 --> 00:30.281
Do you know what it is?
I have no i...

00:30.315 --> 00:33.517
Oh. What the hell is this?

00:33.552 --> 00:35.486
Oh, I framed that for you.

00:35.520 --> 00:37.121
We all look so young.

00:37.139 --> 00:40.057
Nora, we were young. Yeah.

00:40.092 --> 00:42.393
Listen, this picture was
taken by a Detective,

00:42.427 --> 00:44.230
not Annie Leibovitz.
William had us followed?

00:44.231 --> 00:45.881
That's inconceivable to me.

00:45.882 --> 00:48.166
I wasn't even married
to him at the time,

00:48.167 --> 00:50.618
and William had Brody
and me followed.

00:50.653 --> 00:53.705
All right, so tell me,
why are you giving me this photo?

00:53.739 --> 00:56.041
Well, because I think it's
a good picture of you.

00:56.075 --> 00:58.576
That is ridiculous. You keep this.

00:58.594 --> 01:00.238
You're the one who's
obsessed with Brody.

01:00.239 --> 01:01.362
That's not true. Okay, fine.

01:01.397 --> 01:03.515
I'll keep it.

01:03.549 --> 01:04.274
That's probably Brody on the phone.

01:04.275 --> 01:05.548
You better go get it.
Will you stop it?

01:05.549 --> 01:09.354
Go get the phone. Okay, I'm coming.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

01:10.523 --> 01:13.692
Hello. Tommy! It's Tommy.

01:13.693 --> 01:15.944
Tommy's landed.

01:15.962 --> 01:17.413
So, um...

01:17.447 --> 01:20.849
Do you want to tell me
what the surprise is now?

01:20.884 --> 01:23.085
All right. Fine. No, that's fine.

01:23.119 --> 01:26.355
Fine. So I'll see you soon.
Love you. Bye.

01:27.958 --> 01:31.493
What in God's name is he
gonna spring on us now?

01:31.528 --> 01:33.963
Nora, come on. Surprises
are supposed to be fun.

01:33.997 --> 01:36.854
Not in this family.
I just want him back.

01:36.855 --> 01:38.806
Yeah, well, we all want him back.

01:38.840 --> 01:40.624
I'll see you tonight, honey, okay?

01:40.659 --> 01:42.076
Okay. Oh, Nora.

01:42.110 --> 01:44.612
Yeah? You missed a spot.

01:44.646 --> 01:46.313
Ha.

02:02.856 --> 02:04.168
***

02:04.279 --> 02:05.237
They're gonna end up on the floor.

02:05.238 --> 02:07.004
Oh, my God.
What are you doing here?

02:07.022 --> 02:09.883
Your flight wasn't till 12:00.
Oh, my God.

02:09.883 --> 02:11.087
I was just about to leave

02:11.088 --> 02:13.303
to pick you up from the airport.
I took a cab.

02:14.755 --> 02:17.874
Mm. Mm. I missed you so much.

02:17.925 --> 02:19.592
Here. Let me take this.

02:19.627 --> 02:21.010
Okay, listen. What?

02:21.045 --> 02:23.196
You and I, we can never
be apart that long again.

02:23.230 --> 02:24.926
If you go to Shanghai,
I'm coming with you.

02:24.927 --> 02:27.461
I could get used to dim sum.
I will never leave you again.

02:27.496 --> 02:29.447
You know, Tommy's
coming back today.

02:29.498 --> 02:30.593
I've been thinking about asking

02:30.594 --> 02:33.699
him to walk me down the aisle.
That would be perfect.

02:35.560 --> 02:37.828
Uh... Sarah, please don't take it.

02:37.862 --> 02:40.097
It's probably mom about Tommy.
I'll be really fast.

02:40.131 --> 02:42.642
Why you guys always answer the phone?
I'll be two seconds.

02:42.643 --> 02:46.034
I don't get it. Oh. Hi, mom.
Speak fast. Luc just got in.

02:46.035 --> 02:49.971
Well, tell him I said hi,
and I will see him tonight. Okay?

02:50.005 --> 02:53.274
Listen, Sarah, Tommy called.
He just landed.

02:53.309 --> 02:56.194
He has a great big
surprise for all of us.

02:56.228 --> 02:59.697
What is it? Maybe he's moving home.
Wouldn't that be great?

02:59.732 --> 03:02.534
Do you think that's what it is?

03:02.568 --> 03:05.386
I'd have no idea, mom. You talk
to Tommy more than any of us.

03:05.421 --> 03:06.738
Hello.

03:06.772 --> 03:08.690
Hey, Justin.
Hey, how was your trip?

03:08.724 --> 03:11.543
Do me a favor. Get your
mom off the phone now.

03:11.577 --> 03:13.193
I would love to spend
some time with Sarah.

03:13.194 --> 03:15.190
Got it. Get it. Good.
Done. Dialing.

03:15.191 --> 03:17.975
Thank you. I just don't
know why he would tell me

03:18.010 --> 03:20.912
there's a great big surprise
and not tell me what it is.

03:20.946 --> 03:22.413
So, uh...

03:22.448 --> 03:24.432
Oh, wait. Hold on.
Someone's calling.

03:24.466 --> 03:26.367
It's Justin.
Maybe he knows something.

03:26.401 --> 03:28.986
I'll... I'll talk to you later.
Okay. Bye, mom.

03:30.489 --> 03:32.439
You're a genius.

03:32.458 --> 03:37.852
Oh, what did I do
without you around?

03:37.853 --> 03:39.837
Look, mom, Tommy could be

03:39.905 --> 03:41.806
bringing the space
needle back from Seattle.

03:41.840 --> 03:43.558
I'm just really glad we're
finally gonna get to see him.

03:43.559 --> 03:45.313
Hey, uh, look, Annie's here.

03:45.314 --> 03:46.995
I gotta go. Is she still
joining us tonight?

03:47.029 --> 03:48.763
Uh, yes, that's the plan.

03:48.798 --> 03:50.999
Do you want me to introduce
her as your girlfriend?

03:51.033 --> 03:53.827
Yes, mom. She is my girlfriend.

03:53.828 --> 03:55.295
Oh, sweetheart.

03:55.329 --> 03:57.714
That's the first time
I've heard you say that.

03:57.765 --> 03:59.525
Yep, you're breaking up.
Driving through...

03:59.526 --> 04:01.000
All right. Okay.
Good-bye. Good-bye.

04:01.018 --> 04:03.146
Love you, mom. Good-bye.

04:03.147 --> 04:05.970
Hi. Hi. So I'm your girlfriend now?

04:05.971 --> 04:08.873
Yes. I hope that doesn't
come as a surprise to you.

04:08.907 --> 04:12.057
No, it doesn't. But you
being here is a surprise.

04:12.058 --> 04:13.220
I thought you had the day off.

04:13.221 --> 04:14.576
Oh, no. I, uh, I picked up a shift.

04:14.610 --> 04:17.095
Oh. But don't forget,
this afternoon, we gotta hit

04:17.129 --> 04:19.064
that softball diamond.
Little brave hearts cap on.

04:19.098 --> 04:21.815
You know I like it when you get
all sporty on me. Ooh, do you?

04:21.851 --> 04:22.970
Morning.

04:22.971 --> 04:25.906
I was hoping I would run into
you guys today. Oh, uh, hey.

04:25.940 --> 04:28.575
Hey. So do you see
him as much as I do?

04:28.610 --> 04:29.861
'Cause you're...
you're kind of around,

04:29.862 --> 04:32.643
like, a lot. Yeah, well, a resident

04:32.644 --> 04:34.645
very rarely leaves
the hospital, Justin.

04:34.663 --> 04:36.797
Although this afternoon
is an exception.

04:36.831 --> 04:38.632
Why is that?

04:38.683 --> 04:40.884
Oh, well, j.D.
Tore his rotator cuff.

04:40.919 --> 04:42.519
J.D.'S hurt? Mm-hmm.

04:42.537 --> 04:44.521
Great. Who the hell's
gonna pitch for us?

04:44.556 --> 04:46.991
Well... I am.

04:47.025 --> 04:49.526
But don't worry. You know,
uh, the game before I left,

04:49.561 --> 04:51.528
I pitched a shutout.
Tell him. Tell him.

04:51.546 --> 04:53.330
He pitched a shutout.

04:53.875 --> 04:57.511
Wow. You could try getting a
little bit more excited than that.

04:57.545 --> 04:59.269
No, trust me, okay? I was amazing.

04:59.270 --> 05:01.971
Okay, how about this?
He pitched a shutout

05:01.989 --> 05:03.957
and was amazing.

05:03.991 --> 05:06.276
Yeah. It's like
having a cheerleader.

05:06.310 --> 05:08.445
Have you seen her in a
baseball jersey yet?

05:08.479 --> 05:09.903
I mean, she looks way
better in it than we do.

05:09.904 --> 05:10.943
That's awesome, right? I'll, uh,

05:10.944 --> 05:14.198
see you on the field. Yeah.
Will do. Can't wait.

05:14.199 --> 05:15.716
See ya.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.484
You know what? Just ignore him.

05:17.502 --> 05:19.987
It's not worth it. Annie,
I'm trying to. He's everywhere.

05:20.021 --> 05:21.922
He's at the E.R.
He's at the taco truck.

05:21.940 --> 05:24.925
He... he's now taking over for
J.D. on the softball diamond.

05:24.959 --> 05:26.912
Come on. Like, he's clearly
still interested in you.

05:26.913 --> 05:30.397
But I'm not interested in him.
Okay? I broke up with him.

05:30.398 --> 05:33.250
Fine. I'll tell you what, I'll
ignore him if you do, too. Great.

05:33.285 --> 05:34.418
Deal?

05:34.452 --> 05:36.587
Yeah.

05:37.674 --> 05:40.109
My grandma could pitch a shutout,
by the way.

05:40.144 --> 05:42.979
Just so... Let it go.
Just let it go.

05:43.013 --> 05:44.881
Ta-da!

05:44.915 --> 05:46.349
Is the wall color okay?

05:46.383 --> 05:48.287
We weren't sure if yellow
was gonna be too bright.

05:48.288 --> 05:49.506
Yeah, and we didn't
want to do pink,

05:49.507 --> 05:50.819
'cause we thought it
might be too girlie.

05:50.820 --> 05:51.968
Not that there's anything wrong

05:51.969 --> 05:53.638
with being pink or girlie.
No, of course not.

05:53.672 --> 05:54.279
You know, we... green,

05:54.280 --> 05:57.187
purple... we can do any color
of the rainbow. Yellow's cool.

05:57.188 --> 05:58.888
I'm just here for
the weekend anyway.

05:58.923 --> 06:02.492
Yes, you are, but eventually,
you'll be living here, so...

06:02.526 --> 06:04.290
And we want you to be comfortable.

06:04.291 --> 06:06.225
Yeah, you know what?
Live with it for this visit.

06:06.259 --> 06:08.494
If you think yellow isn't you,
we can totally repaint it

06:08.528 --> 06:10.496
by the time you...
Totally.

06:10.530 --> 06:12.731
I think I'm just gonna
draw if that's cool.

06:14.610 --> 06:16.077
Yeah, of course. Absolutely.

06:16.112 --> 06:18.046
Um, before you do that,

06:18.080 --> 06:20.398
there's something we
would like to give you.

06:20.433 --> 06:23.368
And you can change this, too, if
you don't like it. Is it yellow?

06:23.402 --> 06:26.037
I'm not sure. I...
Uh, is it? Uh...

06:26.072 --> 06:29.074
I'm kidding. You guys don't need
to buy me anything, you know?

06:29.108 --> 06:31.576
Ooh. S...
Ugh. It's my mom.

06:31.610 --> 06:33.394
Sorry. Go ahead.

06:35.247 --> 06:36.915
Sorry.

06:36.949 --> 06:39.267
It's his mom. She can wait.
Believe me. Open your present.

06:39.301 --> 06:40.885
Yeah. I like the wrapping.

06:40.920 --> 06:43.555
Good.

06:43.589 --> 06:46.357
The box is ringing.
I think I know what it is.

06:46.392 --> 06:48.526
Yeah. Sorry.

06:48.561 --> 06:52.163
Let me just, um... see.

06:52.198 --> 06:54.099
Oh, yeah. Can you hold that?

06:54.133 --> 06:57.769
Mom, what are you doing? Well,
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

06:57.803 --> 07:00.805
I just wanted to find out...
Does she like my gift?

07:00.839 --> 07:02.690
No, you couldn't
resist talking to her.

07:02.725 --> 07:04.325
What if she'd picked up?
You're gonna meet her, okay?

07:04.326 --> 07:06.860
Can you just calm down?
Can I draw now?

07:07.321 --> 07:09.289
Yeah. You know what?
I'm gonna go find out

07:09.323 --> 07:10.654
if we have everything
we need for dinner.

07:10.655 --> 07:11.946
Could you, uh, grab her some paper?

07:11.947 --> 07:14.014
I have a notebook. Okay.

07:14.049 --> 07:18.673
Kevin. Kevin, listen,
give her some space. Don't push.

07:18.674 --> 07:21.042
Hi, pot. This is kettle.
You're black.

07:21.060 --> 07:23.489
All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

07:23.490 --> 07:26.081
But tell me, does she like it?
I don't know.

07:26.082 --> 07:28.388
Why don't we let her try it
before we run out of minutes?

07:28.389 --> 07:31.366
Well, I got her an unlimited plan.
Of course you did.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.661
Look, I know you guys
can't come tonight.

07:33.662 --> 07:34.857
I'm meeting Tommy for coffee.

07:34.892 --> 07:36.543
Well, good, good.

07:36.577 --> 07:39.679
Did he happen to tell you
anything about a big surprise? No.

07:39.713 --> 07:42.815
Bye, mom. Oh, all right. Good-bye.

07:42.850 --> 07:45.852
I am so sorry my mom
ruined your surprise.

07:45.886 --> 07:49.355
But she just wanted you to
be able to reach us anytime.

07:49.390 --> 07:51.824
But pretty cool, huh?
You can text me anytime you want.

07:51.858 --> 07:54.740
I'm a huge texter. I might
even tweet you. Who's Tommy?

07:54.741 --> 07:56.062
Uh, he's my brother,

07:56.096 --> 07:57.401
and I'm just gonna grab
a quick coffee with him.

07:57.402 --> 07:58.215
And while he does that,

07:58.216 --> 08:00.562
I thought you and I could
go shopping. We stocked up,

08:00.563 --> 08:02.078
but I'm sure we've missed
a couple of things.

08:02.112 --> 08:04.614
So why don't you just
write down some stuff

08:04.632 --> 08:06.187
you think you might
need on that list?

08:06.188 --> 08:07.784
If you want to go
hang out with Tommy...

08:07.818 --> 08:10.077
N-no. Are you kidding me?
I want to hang with you.

08:10.078 --> 08:13.288
Uh, if it's okay with you,
I'm gonna draw.

08:13.289 --> 08:14.456
Okay.

08:14.491 --> 08:15.591
Okay.

08:15.625 --> 08:16.759
Okay.

08:16.793 --> 08:17.927
Okay.

08:22.098 --> 08:23.632
Mom!

08:25.161 --> 08:26.010
Mom!

08:26.011 --> 08:27.344
Tommy?

08:27.378 --> 08:28.512
Hey.

08:28.546 --> 08:32.232
Tommy. Oh, Tommy. Oh, honey.

08:32.234 --> 08:34.852
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
Mom. Mwah.

08:34.870 --> 08:36.703
Welcome home.

08:36.739 --> 08:39.323
Mama Nora.

08:39.357 --> 08:40.707
Oh!

08:40.743 --> 08:42.710
I'm so excited to meet you.

08:42.745 --> 08:44.546
Mwah. Mwah.

08:44.580 --> 08:47.549
Tommy's told me
everything about you.

08:47.583 --> 08:48.472
Well, that's funny,

08:48.473 --> 08:51.407
'cause he's told me
absolutely nothing about you.

08:51.442 --> 08:52.809
Surprise.

08:57.441 --> 09:00.282
Ss05e13

09:04.202 --> 09:06.404
if there's one place not
to have your iPod playing,

09:06.438 --> 09:08.212
it's the pike place fish market.
That's right.

09:08.213 --> 09:10.141
That's where they throw
the fish for the tourists.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.714
Right. So I was
listening to Katy Perry.

09:11.715 --> 09:12.677
Right, and outta nowhere,

09:12.711 --> 09:13.670
this mackerel started

09:13.671 --> 09:17.189
heading straight for her head.
Hello. Tommy?

09:17.190 --> 09:20.210
Uh, Sarah. We're in here, honey.
Where are you, little brother?

09:20.211 --> 09:22.195
Come here and give me a hug.

09:22.213 --> 09:24.731
Sarah, hi. It... it...
it's so nice to meet you.

09:24.765 --> 09:27.901
Uh, Sarah, this is Rose.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.636
This is Tommy's surprise.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.389
Wait. Come on, mom.
Can you let her finish the story?

09:32.423 --> 09:33.825
Okay, I'll do the quick version first.
Okay. Do the... All right.

09:33.826 --> 09:36.343
So Tommy leaps in front of the fish,
and he catches it

09:36.394 --> 09:39.196
right before it hits me smack
in the middle of the face.

09:39.230 --> 09:41.431
I mean, could you imagine?

09:42.167 --> 09:43.668
Death by mackerel.

09:44.674 --> 09:46.691
Death by mackerel.

09:46.726 --> 09:50.061
Sarah, let me give
you a real hello.

09:50.096 --> 09:51.796
Oh, hello.

09:51.830 --> 09:53.331
Mwah. Mwah. Ooh. Ooh.

09:53.349 --> 09:55.133
Tommy just thinks the world of you.

09:55.167 --> 09:56.960
Good. Maybe I can get
a hug out of him.

09:56.961 --> 09:59.038
Of course you can. Hey.

09:59.039 --> 10:00.723
Hi, honey.

10:00.758 --> 10:03.042
It's so good to see you.
It's been too long.

10:03.060 --> 10:04.935
Listen, uh, Luc's sorry he
couldn't get over this morning.

10:04.936 --> 10:06.262
He just got off a 15-hour flight.

10:06.263 --> 10:07.670
But he's coming for dinner tonight?

10:07.705 --> 10:09.610
Oh, sure. He's just
sleeping off his jet lag.

10:09.611 --> 10:11.945
Listen, we're really hoping to
spend a bit of time with you

10:11.979 --> 10:13.613
before you go back, okay? Me, too.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.460
I-I can't wait to meet him.

10:15.461 --> 10:17.896
Yeah, great. Uh,
the four of us will do something.

10:17.930 --> 10:20.197
Sarah, how about some coffee?

10:20.215 --> 10:22.667
Come on in. Everybody sit down.

10:22.701 --> 10:25.536
Uh, you know, Rose,
we... we just haven't heard

10:25.554 --> 10:29.508
a-a peep out of Tommy
a-about all of this.

10:29.509 --> 10:32.397
I-I wish I would've met you sooner.

10:32.398 --> 10:34.849
You sound like all of our
friends back in Seattle.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.285
They keep asking, "when are
you gonna come up for air?"

10:37.320 --> 10:39.887
It's my fault.
I couldn't get enough of him.

10:39.905 --> 10:41.389
Stop it.

10:41.407 --> 10:43.625
It's the honeymoon phase, you know?

10:43.659 --> 10:46.628
I-I had to prepare her
to meet the family.

10:46.662 --> 10:48.863
How long have you guys been,
uh, together?

10:48.898 --> 10:50.532
Um, six months... six months...

10:52.068 --> 10:53.802
And three days. And... Yeah.

10:54.501 --> 10:57.570
Oh. So it takes six
months and three days

10:57.604 --> 10:59.967
to prepare someone
to meet the family?

10:59.968 --> 11:02.970
Oh, no, no. Oh,
your family is amazing.

11:03.038 --> 11:05.506
In fact, when, uh, I wanted
to bring you a gift, Nora,

11:05.540 --> 11:07.525
Tommy said that you
had every cake cutter

11:07.576 --> 11:09.343
and serving tray known to man.

11:09.377 --> 11:12.179
So instead, I thought I would
make you a family tree.

11:12.214 --> 11:14.348
I made one for my best friend.
She loved it.

11:14.382 --> 11:17.051
So I hope you don't mind,
but I started one for you.

11:17.085 --> 11:20.538
It... it's not ready yet.
Your family is fascinating.

11:20.589 --> 11:23.323
Let's talk about your
great-Uncle Mickey.

11:23.341 --> 11:26.327
I-I didn't even know I
had a great-Uncle Mickey.

11:26.361 --> 11:28.329
Oh, yeah. He saved 33
children from cholera.

11:28.363 --> 11:30.898
I mean, that's amazing, huh?

11:30.932 --> 11:34.068
Oh, my God. I must
sound like a stalker.

11:34.102 --> 11:37.855
The truth is, I...
I'm just obsessed with history.

11:37.889 --> 11:41.141
In fact, I did one of those
civil war reenactments once.

11:41.176 --> 11:43.811
A family tree is much simpler.
Yeah, I bet.

11:46.531 --> 11:48.482
I think I'm a little nervous.

11:48.516 --> 11:50.484
No. You're doing great. Okay? Okay.

11:50.518 --> 11:52.870
Now you see why she's
the light of my life?

11:52.904 --> 11:56.457
You said that the first day we
moved in together. That's right.

11:56.491 --> 11:58.559
You live together?

11:58.593 --> 12:01.095
Mom, yeah.

12:01.129 --> 12:03.213
No, no. No, no.
It's... it's... it's great.

12:03.248 --> 12:05.665
Just, you know, a surprise. Yeah.

12:05.666 --> 12:09.169
A wonderful surprise,
but a big ol' surprise.

12:09.204 --> 12:10.637
Yeah.

12:15.707 --> 12:16.751
You ready to go?

12:18.614 --> 12:21.900
What's this? Just the
list of stuff that I want.

12:21.934 --> 12:23.401
Oh, you drew it.

12:23.435 --> 12:27.138
Okay, so this is a hat,
uh, pajamas,

12:27.172 --> 12:29.974
an electric toothbrush,
and... that's a gecko.

12:30.009 --> 12:32.310
I can see that. You don't
really need to get me one.

12:32.311 --> 12:34.178
I just think they're really cool.

12:34.213 --> 12:36.147
Olivia, you are very talented.

12:36.181 --> 12:38.639
Thanks. Come on. Let's go.

12:38.640 --> 12:39.831
Okay.

12:41.729 --> 12:43.043
Here, look. That's Rose.

12:43.044 --> 12:44.961
All right. Let me see.

12:45.012 --> 12:46.947
Oh, wow. She's beautiful.

12:46.981 --> 12:48.899
I thought blondes
are more your type.

12:48.933 --> 12:51.543
No. Tommy's always been an
equal-opportunity Lothario.

12:51.544 --> 12:53.979
Coming from the man who
dated three guys at once?

12:54.013 --> 12:55.881
Technically,
I didn't date any of them.

12:55.915 --> 12:57.715
Besides, I'm married now,

12:57.733 --> 13:00.277
starting a family as we speak.

13:00.278 --> 13:02.229
Oh, let me see. Let me see.

13:02.263 --> 13:03.600
Is this... Olivia's adorable.

13:03.601 --> 13:04.215
Right?

13:04.216 --> 13:07.271
Let me see. Oh, man.
She's beautiful.

13:07.272 --> 13:10.174
Right? All right, while we're doing it,
take a look at Annie.

13:10.192 --> 13:12.353
Give me mine back.
I need to text Olivia.

13:12.354 --> 13:16.571
Wow. That's Annie. So is she,
uh, is she the real deal?

13:16.572 --> 13:19.107
Yeah, we'll find out
after the softball game.

13:19.142 --> 13:21.109
Oh, yeah. So is the ex
a pitcher or a catcher?

13:21.144 --> 13:23.011
Seriously, Kevin?
It's a legitimate sports question.

13:23.029 --> 13:25.313
It's true. That is.
Well, I don't know,

13:25.348 --> 13:27.282
but I know he's
definitely still into her.

13:27.300 --> 13:29.751
Yeah, but the question is,
is Annie still into Dr. Rick?

13:29.786 --> 13:31.430
Well, she says she's not.
That's a hot name, by the way.

13:31.431 --> 13:34.870
Thanks, Kev. All right?
He's a cardiology resident also.

13:34.871 --> 13:37.439
So? You're a 3-time war vet,
all right?

13:37.473 --> 13:39.374
He's just trying to rattle you.
Go to the game,

13:39.408 --> 13:42.344
you hit a couple of home runs,
and then rush back to mom's,

13:42.378 --> 13:44.980
all right? I'm gonna need your help.
Why? What's going on?

13:45.014 --> 13:49.019
Mom had that look earlier,
like when you were dating Fawn.

13:49.020 --> 13:50.604
Ooh. Ooh. That's not good.

13:50.655 --> 13:53.189
No, and Sarah kept
narrowing her eyes

13:53.224 --> 13:56.125
every time we were talking.
Yeah. She thinks she's weird.

13:56.143 --> 13:58.929
What? What did she... did she call you?
No, I got a text.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.797
What did she say? "She's weird."

14:00.831 --> 14:03.717
Sarah's always the last one
to be won over. You know that.

14:03.751 --> 14:05.971
Which is why I need you
guys to back me up.

14:05.972 --> 14:09.752
She's not weird. She's great.
She's not what you might expect.

14:09.753 --> 14:11.704
But she's funny and smart and kind,

14:11.739 --> 14:14.181
and, yeah, she's not
afraid of saying anything.

14:14.182 --> 14:15.459
Okay. Then she'll fit in fine.

14:15.460 --> 14:17.035
Yeah. You're getting
a text from her.

14:17.119 --> 14:19.003
"1-4-3." What does that mean?

14:22.435 --> 14:25.371
What? Uh, all right, fine.
It's this thing we do.

14:25.405 --> 14:27.306
It means "I love you."

14:27.340 --> 14:29.241
You know, the "I"
is a 1-letter word,

14:29.309 --> 14:30.826
and love's a 4-letter...

14:32.012 --> 14:33.478
Nerd alert.

14:33.496 --> 14:36.498
Anyway, she's amazing.
I gotta get to Sarah's.

14:36.533 --> 14:37.968
Why isn't Olivia texting me back?

14:37.969 --> 14:39.752
Because she's still
shopping with Scotty.

14:39.786 --> 14:41.720
Yeah, I know, but I thought
she'd be like Paige...

14:41.755 --> 14:43.209
thumbs permanently
cramped at right angles.

14:43.210 --> 14:44.156
You ready for your big game?

14:44.190 --> 14:46.075
Dr. Rick doesn't know
what's coming. All right.

14:46.109 --> 14:47.593
All right. 1-4-3, bro.

14:47.627 --> 14:50.195
Yeah. See you, guys. Later. Later.

14:50.230 --> 14:53.349
Yeah, loosen it up!

14:54.475 --> 14:55.892
I mean, I gotta say,

14:55.926 --> 14:58.072
this ponytail look is
really working for me.

14:58.073 --> 14:59.122
Really? Yeah.

14:59.123 --> 15:01.091
Should I wear it to
your mom's dinner?

15:01.125 --> 15:03.661
No. I think you should
wear it after. Hello.

15:03.695 --> 15:05.613
Sorry I'm late. I'm here.
We had a red line. Rick!

15:05.664 --> 15:07.615
Touch and go.
I wasn't gonna make it.

15:07.666 --> 15:09.270
But I saved his life
quick and I'm here.

15:09.942 --> 15:13.166
Yo, Justin. Glad you could make it.
Yeah, I was on time.

15:13.167 --> 15:16.135
I guess we save lives
faster than you do, huh?

15:16.170 --> 15:18.207
He... he is funny.

15:19.302 --> 15:21.887
Annie, I have a present for you.

15:21.888 --> 15:24.523
Oh, my God. The lucky penny.

15:24.558 --> 15:26.017
Yeah. What, you think I'd lose it?

15:26.018 --> 15:27.993
We found this on the
mound right before we won

15:28.028 --> 15:29.879
the league playoffs. Yeah.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.497
Great having you back.

15:31.515 --> 15:33.549
Oh, thanks, Kell.
Now control yourself, Justin.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.218
I'm taking my shirt off.
Oh, I'll try, she-hulk.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.854
Oh, my God. What a show-off.

15:38.889 --> 15:41.307
All right. Let's go. Play ball!

15:41.341 --> 15:43.993
Nice medium jersey, dude.

15:48.510 --> 15:50.144
Hi. Hi.

15:50.178 --> 15:52.246
You need some help? No, no, no, no.

15:52.281 --> 15:54.732
I could do a leg of
lamb in my sleep.

15:54.766 --> 15:57.318
But you could chop the
garlic for me if you like.

15:57.352 --> 15:58.786
I'd be honored.

15:58.821 --> 16:00.955
Okay. Is your room all right?

16:00.989 --> 16:02.548
You need any more
towels or anything?

16:02.549 --> 16:05.844
Nora, I've seen department
stores with less of a selection.

16:06.447 --> 16:08.181
And that shower... Oh.

16:08.216 --> 16:11.988
I'm telling you, I could
sell this place in a second.

16:13.916 --> 16:15.215
Oh. I'm a broker.

16:15.216 --> 16:17.751
Oh. Oh. Of course, if I lived here,

16:17.785 --> 16:19.501
I wouldn't want to part
with this place either.

16:19.502 --> 16:21.685
No. This has been our
home for a very long time.

16:21.720 --> 16:25.220
Did you know that your
maternal grandmother

16:25.221 --> 16:27.980
had an aunt who was
killed by circus dogs?

16:27.981 --> 16:29.968
No, I didn't know that.

16:29.969 --> 16:32.117
But now I do, unfortunately.

16:32.152 --> 16:33.986
I am way into the family tree.

16:34.020 --> 16:35.921
What you can find on the Internet

16:35.955 --> 16:38.924
would make your head spin.

16:38.958 --> 16:40.893
Nora, I want you to know

16:40.927 --> 16:43.495
that Tommy and I are
very happy together.

16:43.530 --> 16:45.164
Well, good.

16:45.198 --> 16:48.684
Good, Rose. I'm glad.
I'm... I'm glad.

16:48.685 --> 16:51.403
Do you feel like you lost him?
Because you shouldn't.

16:51.438 --> 16:53.772
You know, I think he
actually feels like

16:53.807 --> 16:57.910
he let all of you down,
like he's lost you.

16:58.677 --> 17:00.044
Really?

17:00.078 --> 17:03.347
You know, I think maybe you
want to peel that garlic first,

17:03.382 --> 17:04.848
don't you think?

17:04.883 --> 17:06.851
Just, you know... Oh.

17:06.885 --> 17:09.220
Get it all opened up before...
Oh.

17:09.253 --> 17:10.887
You know what?

17:10.923 --> 17:12.965
Let's just not even
chop the garlic.

17:12.967 --> 17:16.787
Let's press it and then
rub it all over the lamb.

17:16.788 --> 17:17.405
How about that?

17:17.406 --> 17:18.771
If you would just get
me the garlic press

17:18.772 --> 17:19.746
out of the top drawer.

17:19.747 --> 17:22.107
It's the silver dooey-wad thing.

17:25.707 --> 17:28.792
Nora. Is this you?

17:28.843 --> 17:32.157
Oh, yes. Well, that was
taken a very long time ago.

17:32.158 --> 17:35.062
Oh, and who's that? Uh,
that's my brother Saul.

17:35.063 --> 17:37.031
Who's that other guy? Uh, n-no one.

17:37.065 --> 17:38.950
He... it's just a friend.
Just... just a friend.

17:39.001 --> 17:41.348
You know what? Why don't you
forget about the garlic?

17:41.349 --> 17:44.181
I'll do the garlic.
You slice the green beans.

17:44.367 --> 17:46.486
Okay.

17:46.820 --> 17:48.787
Wow. This place is cool.

17:48.822 --> 17:50.789
How many of these
stations do you own?

17:50.840 --> 17:53.555
Five. And it's all
about the ad buy.

17:53.556 --> 17:55.474
Probably the last
thing you ever thought

17:55.508 --> 17:56.987
I'd be doing, right? Actually, no.

17:56.988 --> 17:59.872
Do you remember in high school,
you were the homeroom deejay?

17:59.907 --> 18:01.726
I mean, you used to sell ads to
businesses. Oh, my God. Yeah.

18:01.727 --> 18:03.694
Remember? This is
Sarah Walker with...

18:03.728 --> 18:08.461
Your morning spin God. So lame.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.863
No, it wasn't. You were great.
You were the only reason

18:10.897 --> 18:13.229
people showed up
early before class.

18:13.973 --> 18:14.928
Oh, God.

18:14.929 --> 18:17.159
You know, it...

18:17.193 --> 18:19.228
You've really done something
great for yourself.

18:19.262 --> 18:20.395
Thanks.

18:20.429 --> 18:22.998
Well, this is nice,
Tommy, having you here.

18:24.260 --> 18:25.900
Actually, there's something
I've been wanting...

18:25.901 --> 18:27.318
To ask... what?

18:27.319 --> 18:29.186
Nothing. I mean, you go first.

18:29.220 --> 18:30.621
Okay.

18:30.655 --> 18:32.089
All right, listen,

18:32.123 --> 18:35.025
so it's a real estate
investment project.

18:35.060 --> 18:36.527
Real estate?

18:36.561 --> 18:38.712
Yeah, Rose is a broker,

18:38.763 --> 18:41.131
and, you know,
we want to do something big.

18:41.149 --> 18:43.067
We need seed money.

18:43.101 --> 18:45.970
Oh, so you found a bank that
wants to give you capital?

18:46.004 --> 18:50.001
No. We're not having
any luck with banks.

18:50.002 --> 18:52.610
That's why I'm asking you.

18:52.611 --> 18:54.546
Oh.

18:54.580 --> 18:58.149
Look, we're gonna start
by flipping small houses...

18:58.184 --> 18:59.951
Is this your idea or Rose's?

19:00.019 --> 19:01.486
Both.

19:01.520 --> 19:04.389
Well, you know, Tommy, if I'd
have known this was gonna be

19:04.423 --> 19:06.524
a business pitch,
I would've worn different shoes.

19:06.542 --> 19:07.976
Why are you acting
like this? Tommy,

19:07.977 --> 19:09.928
I thought you were coming
down here to reconnect.

19:09.962 --> 19:12.197
I've barely talked to you in...
in two months.

19:12.231 --> 19:15.300
Yeah, well, it's not like you've
been calling me. I gave up

19:15.334 --> 19:17.499
because you would take like
five days to call me back.

19:17.500 --> 19:18.903
Are we really having this argument?

19:18.938 --> 19:20.638
Yeah.

19:22.833 --> 19:25.423
Okay, let me answer your request.

19:25.424 --> 19:27.412
Flipping houses is something you do

19:27.413 --> 19:29.704
when you catch a bubble,
not after it's burst.

19:29.705 --> 19:31.773
It's also a good time to buy.

19:31.807 --> 19:33.742
Anyway, this company's
assets aren't liquid,

19:33.776 --> 19:35.944
so I couldn't invest
even if I wanted to.

19:35.978 --> 19:37.577
No, I understand.
Look, you know what?

19:37.578 --> 19:40.763
Why don't you put together a proposal? I'll...
Sarah, it's okay.

19:40.797 --> 19:43.032
So, uh...

19:43.066 --> 19:46.135
Anyway... what did
you think of Rose?

19:47.099 --> 19:48.900
Well, um...

19:48.934 --> 19:51.069
"Well, um"? She's great.

19:51.087 --> 19:53.305
Oh. I-I saw your
little text to Kevin.

19:53.339 --> 19:55.407
No, l... I was kidding.

19:55.441 --> 19:58.910
Yeah. Thanks for the coffee.
I'll see you at dinner.

19:58.945 --> 20:00.845
Fine.

20:00.880 --> 20:01.896
All right. Come on. Big hit.

20:01.897 --> 20:03.995
Batter up. Let's go, Garrett!

20:06.477 --> 20:07.413
Call it!

20:07.414 --> 20:09.733
Got it! Got it! Got it!

20:10.237 --> 20:12.494
What are you doing, man? I had it.

20:12.495 --> 20:13.565
Yeah, it didn't look like you did.

20:13.566 --> 20:15.133
Yeah? Well, how about
you play your position,

20:15.134 --> 20:15.761
I'll play mine, all right?

20:15.762 --> 20:16.985
All right, buddy.
Why don't you calm down?

20:16.986 --> 20:18.865
We're all on the same team.
Is everything okay?

20:19.307 --> 20:22.277
Yeah, it's fine. Don't worry about it.
You'll get the next one.

20:22.363 --> 20:24.059
Come on, slugger. You're up first.

20:26.741 --> 20:30.846
Okay, Swiss chard,
Swiss chard, Swiss chard.

20:31.358 --> 20:32.285
Hi.

20:33.533 --> 20:34.638
Okay.

20:39.785 --> 20:42.057
Okay. I have one thing left
on my list. How about you?

20:43.100 --> 20:43.555
I'm done.

20:43.556 --> 20:46.782
You're done? Seriously? But I
always win supermarket sweep.

20:48.055 --> 20:49.620
But you didn't get
anything from the list.

20:49.621 --> 20:51.414
That's the whole point of the game.

20:51.560 --> 20:54.146
I got the stuff I like.
I can see that.

20:54.147 --> 20:55.914
I don't understand why
we're shopping anyway.

20:55.915 --> 20:57.693
What's the point of
living above a restaurant

20:57.694 --> 20:59.166
if you can't even eat there?

20:59.691 --> 21:02.166
Well, because the
restaurant is our business.

21:02.167 --> 21:03.818
We're going to eat where we live.

21:03.872 --> 21:05.214
Do you still have the list?

21:07.530 --> 21:08.626
Okay.

21:11.265 --> 21:12.072
All right, let's make a deal.

21:12.073 --> 21:13.361
We'll get the rest of the
things we need from this list,

21:13.362 --> 21:15.411
and you can keep a couple
of the things you want

21:15.412 --> 21:18.107
in your basket. Do we have
to play that game again?

21:18.212 --> 21:19.940
Was it lame? Kinda.

21:20.241 --> 21:22.370
Sorry. I'm so old.

21:23.019 --> 21:25.228
Okay, vodka.

21:31.685 --> 21:32.745
Let's go. Right down the middle.

21:46.648 --> 21:50.152
Yeah, Justin! Let's go! Come home,
Justin! Come on!

21:50.540 --> 21:51.327
You're out!

21:51.328 --> 21:52.683
What? What are you talking about?

21:52.684 --> 21:54.274
I was safe by a mile. You're out.

21:54.275 --> 21:55.981
Oh, man. Are you...
Tell me you saw that.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.451
It was close.
What?

21:57.452 --> 21:59.649
The ball got there first, Justin.
Are you serious?

21:59.650 --> 22:02.300
Justin, I didn't see it. Yeah,
don't take it so seriously, buddy.

22:02.301 --> 22:04.275
It's just a game. Don't call me buddy,
douche, all right?

22:04.276 --> 22:06.166
What'd you call me? You heard me.
Douche, as in Dr. douche.

22:06.167 --> 22:08.340
Whoa, whoa, Justin. Stop. Listen,

22:08.341 --> 22:10.092
I was safe, and this
asshat over here...

22:10.099 --> 22:11.384
You know what? Screw you.
Oh, you know what?

22:11.385 --> 22:13.693
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Guys, guys, guys.

22:13.801 --> 22:18.887
Hey! Stop it! Get up! Come on,
you guys! Split up!

22:25.368 --> 22:27.681
You know, I think I'm gonna
go change my earrings, okay?

22:27.682 --> 22:30.259
Uh-huh. First it's the dress,
now it's the earrings.

22:30.260 --> 22:31.594
You're stalling. Come on.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.079
I just feel like I-I got off

22:33.080 --> 22:34.808
on the wrong foot with your family.

22:35.006 --> 22:36.531
I mean, you should've
seen your mother's face

22:36.532 --> 22:37.812
when I pulled out that photograph.

22:37.813 --> 22:40.661
Look, forget the photo,
okay? I love you.

22:41.026 --> 22:44.412
And they know that.
And that's all that matters, okay?

22:44.413 --> 22:45.452
Okay.

22:46.368 --> 22:49.019
Thank you. Whoa. Hey, bro.

22:49.020 --> 22:49.713
Hey. Hey.

22:49.714 --> 22:52.322
How are you? And, uh,
you must be Rose.

22:52.328 --> 22:54.808
Wow. The... the photos on Tommy's
phone do you no justice.

22:54.809 --> 22:56.361
Thank you. You're Justin, right?

22:56.362 --> 22:58.949
Yes, I'm Justin. And this is,
uh, this is Annie. Hey. Hi.

22:58.950 --> 23:00.228
Hi. This is Tommy.

23:00.229 --> 23:01.062
Hey. Nice to meet you both. Hey.

23:01.133 --> 23:03.702
Good to meet you.
So, uh, how was the game?

23:03.703 --> 23:07.748
Did you win? Uh, well, we would've
if the umpire wasn't blind.

23:07.749 --> 23:10.739
It's kind of a sore subject.
Justin was called out at home.

23:10.740 --> 23:13.303
So... I was safe, uh, but she
won't admit that I was sa...

23:13.304 --> 23:15.599
I didn't see the play.
What was I supposed to do?

23:15.600 --> 23:18.690
Annie, you want to, um, go get
a drink? Let's do that. Yes.

23:22.682 --> 23:23.495
So, uh,

23:23.496 --> 23:25.609
I guess it didn't go so
good with Dr. Rick, huh?

23:25.610 --> 23:27.482
Oh, yeah. You know what?
Don't even ask.

23:27.693 --> 23:29.240
But Rose... she's great.

23:29.241 --> 23:29.715
Yeah.

23:29.716 --> 23:31.151
The family's gonna love her.

23:31.342 --> 23:32.437
She's probably pissed

23:32.438 --> 23:34.411
you made her play that
stupid sweep game.

23:34.412 --> 23:35.596
Does everybody hate that game?

23:35.597 --> 23:38.667
Well, your version doesn't
actually have cash prizes

23:38.668 --> 23:40.428
at the register.
Well, there could've been.

23:41.828 --> 23:43.512
I mean, she completely
ignored my list.

23:43.513 --> 23:46.538
We can't let her eat like that.
Okay, slow down, Julia child.

23:46.539 --> 23:48.742
We all ate candy as a kid.
We'll talk to her.

23:48.988 --> 23:52.588
Hi. We... Oh, you have your phone.
I was afraid you lost it.

23:52.757 --> 23:54.680
Why? Oh, no biggie.

23:54.681 --> 23:56.760
Uh, I-I sent you a couple of texts,

23:56.761 --> 23:58.553
and you didn't text me back.

23:58.656 --> 24:01.264
I was with Scotty.
Why would I text you?

24:03.992 --> 24:05.736
Sit down with me for a sec,
would you?

24:06.414 --> 24:09.357
We, uh, we want to talk
to you about expectations.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.592
So you want me to do
chores or something?

24:11.866 --> 24:13.509
No, I think what Kevin
is trying to say is,

24:13.510 --> 24:15.655
when we try to reach you,
it would be great if you,

24:15.834 --> 24:19.025
you know, wrote us back. Yeah.
Or like with the groceries.

24:19.026 --> 24:20.528
Because Scotty's such a good chef,

24:20.529 --> 24:22.454
he will make you think green
beans are French fries.

24:22.455 --> 24:24.199
I swear. Okay.

24:24.200 --> 24:26.277
We have a responsibility to
make sure you're healthy.

24:26.278 --> 24:27.848
It's really important to us. Yeah.

24:27.849 --> 24:30.785
I've never even heard of most of
the stuff that's on your list.

24:30.786 --> 24:32.074
Can I go to my room?

24:32.536 --> 24:33.855
We're... we're not angry with you.

24:33.856 --> 24:35.226
We just wanted to
have a little talk.

24:35.227 --> 24:37.066
That's all. I really
want to go to my room.

24:41.608 --> 24:44.329
Would anyone care for some
more wine? Oh, I would.

24:45.124 --> 24:48.581
So, everybody, uh, Sarah and I
have an announcement to make.

24:49.304 --> 24:50.994
Sarah. You tell 'em.

24:51.260 --> 24:53.571
Is everything okay? Yeah.
No, go ahead. Tell 'em.

24:53.572 --> 24:55.752
All right. Um, we've set
a date for the wedding.

24:55.753 --> 24:58.457
Oh, that's wonderful. Bravo.

24:58.458 --> 25:01.114
Okay, to Luc and Sarah

25:01.356 --> 25:03.003
and the culmination of your love...

25:03.288 --> 25:05.000
And to Tommy and Rose

25:05.528 --> 25:06.883
and the beginning of yours.

25:06.884 --> 25:08.471
Well, they've been
shacked up for months,

25:08.472 --> 25:09.732
so it's hardly the beginning. Oh,

25:09.733 --> 25:11.425
come on, Sarah.
You've been shacked up with Luc

25:11.426 --> 25:12.961
since the first time
you saw him do squats.

25:12.962 --> 25:15.062
Stop it. So when are you
getting married, Luc?

25:15.063 --> 25:16.569
May 15th. Yeah. May 15th.
The 15th. Yeah.

25:16.570 --> 25:19.809
How wonderful.
Tommy, I'm so glad you're home

25:19.810 --> 25:21.816
to be a part of this. Thanks, mom.

25:21.817 --> 25:24.115
So you went to see Sarah's
empire today, right? Yep.

25:24.116 --> 25:27.620
Yeah. Tommy wanted to pitch
me this house flipping idea.

25:27.766 --> 25:30.166
I like it. Buy low, sell high.

25:30.529 --> 25:33.392
Thanks, bro. Well, while we're
tossing around aphorisms,

25:33.393 --> 25:35.473
how about being left
holding the bag?

25:35.474 --> 25:37.203
Lows could stay low
a really long time.

25:37.204 --> 25:38.478
You just have to look at Japan.

25:38.479 --> 25:41.243
Well, Sarah, we've actually
thought it through.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.415
And the numbers make sense.

25:43.416 --> 25:45.857
In fact, it's a very
transitional neighborhood

25:45.858 --> 25:47.543
full of young families.

25:47.544 --> 25:50.137
No, I'm sure they're lovely.
The... the question is,

25:50.138 --> 25:52.666
can they afford a house
with unemployment so high?

25:52.777 --> 25:53.918
I don't know. My cousin, actually,

25:53.919 --> 25:56.172
she just bought a house, flipped it,
and made a ton of money.

25:56.173 --> 25:57.810
Uh, Annie, I don't think
you should take sides.

25:57.811 --> 25:59.748
Oh, you're a real estate fan, too?

25:59.861 --> 26:02.918
Um, no, no. I'm just a...
just a softball fan.

26:02.930 --> 26:04.638
Yeah, depends on who's playing.

26:05.618 --> 26:07.179
Annie, if you want
to have any peace,

26:07.180 --> 26:10.129
you gotta tell this guy
he was safe. I was safe,

26:10.130 --> 26:12.021
and I can't believe with all
the camera phones there,

26:12.022 --> 26:12.798
no one recorded it. Okay.

26:12.799 --> 26:14.943
Well, maybe we should
check YouTube later.

26:16.116 --> 26:17.001
What, you think this is funny?

26:17.002 --> 26:19.098
I do. I think it's funny, Justin.

26:19.339 --> 26:21.410
Has... has he always been this competitive?
Yes.

26:21.411 --> 26:22.939
Yeah. Yes.

26:22.940 --> 26:24.383
So Tommy's here. Let's...

26:24.384 --> 26:26.383
Come on. Let's talk about Tommy.
Boring.

26:26.384 --> 26:27.606
Yes, um, Tommy, I-I didn't know

26:27.607 --> 26:30.200
you were thinking
about changing jobs.

26:30.576 --> 26:31.949
What about the radio station?

26:31.950 --> 26:33.902
What do you think?
It's very impressive.

26:34.006 --> 26:34.462
Sarah.

26:34.463 --> 26:35.837
Hmm? What?

26:36.621 --> 26:38.601
Well, with Tommy's expertise,

26:38.602 --> 26:40.939
I'm sure you can find
something for him to do.

26:40.940 --> 26:42.626
Mom, this is not the
time or the place.

26:42.627 --> 26:44.421
Besides, Tommy has no interest in...

26:44.422 --> 26:47.398
Yeah, why would I have any
interest in working with you?

26:47.481 --> 26:49.037
You've been completely
condescending

26:49.038 --> 26:50.953
this entire time.
Well, you just showed up

26:50.954 --> 26:52.237
out of the blue and
asked me for money.

26:52.238 --> 26:53.960
What do you expect?
What is wrong with you?

26:53.961 --> 26:55.863
I mean, do you remember
before Ojai closed?

26:55.864 --> 26:57.598
We... we were gonna
work together, Sarah.

26:57.599 --> 27:00.217
How is asking me to invest
in a real estate deal

27:00.218 --> 27:01.683
remotely like us working together

27:01.684 --> 27:03.918
to save our family business, Tommy? How?
I don't know...

27:03.926 --> 27:06.621
All right, stop it, both of you.
Tommy just got home,

27:06.622 --> 27:07.733
and you're fighting about business.

27:07.734 --> 27:09.879
That's enough.
Forget about the real estate.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.931
The two of you loved
working together.

27:11.932 --> 27:13.286
Is that true, Tommy?
Is that what you want,

27:13.287 --> 27:14.839
to come back here and work with me?

27:14.840 --> 27:16.561
Or did you just come back
to raid the piggybank

27:16.562 --> 27:18.641
so you and Rose could
run back to Seattle?

27:18.642 --> 27:20.891
'Cause honestly, I'd really
like to know. Honestly?

27:20.892 --> 27:25.683
Yeah. Luc, uh, I hate to
upstage your announcement,

27:25.684 --> 27:28.665
but she wants to know the
real reason we came down here.

27:28.666 --> 27:29.674
Mm-hmm.

27:31.561 --> 27:32.793
Uh...

27:34.021 --> 27:35.078
We're engaged.

27:36.542 --> 27:40.302
And, um, I wanted my
fiancée to meet my family.

27:41.203 --> 27:44.275
That's the big surprise.

27:44.448 --> 27:46.342
Grazie.

27:46.495 --> 27:49.690
Well... Tommy, that's wonderful.

27:49.691 --> 27:51.893
W-w-we're all so happy for you.

27:51.894 --> 27:53.399
Aren't we happy for him?

27:53.400 --> 27:55.659
Mom, just stop it, all right?
You don't have to do this.

27:55.660 --> 27:58.886
Yes, I do. Tommy, please,
let us reconnect.

27:58.887 --> 28:01.008
It's not easy.
You've been so far away.

28:01.009 --> 28:03.522
It's supposed to be easy!

28:03.531 --> 28:05.391
That's what family is.
It's okay, Tommy.

28:05.392 --> 28:07.743
No, it's not okay, honey.

28:08.085 --> 28:10.527
Last year wasn't just hard
for you guys, all right?

28:10.528 --> 28:14.847
It was hard for me, too.
I felt lost. Probably even more...

28:17.089 --> 28:18.687
And when I met Rose...

28:20.482 --> 28:23.090
She made me believe
in myself again.

28:28.226 --> 28:29.585
Let's go, honey.

28:34.461 --> 28:35.486
Excuse me.

28:52.476 --> 28:55.128
You could lay them out flat.
Then they won't wrinkle.

28:55.129 --> 28:57.817
Wow. Looks like that
summer in retail

28:57.818 --> 28:59.195
finally paid off.

28:59.537 --> 29:00.953
You think they're still hiring?

29:01.747 --> 29:03.006
All right, listen, neither of us

29:03.007 --> 29:03.985
wants to be the first to blink,

29:03.986 --> 29:06.017
so just this once, I will, okay?

29:06.719 --> 29:08.990
You hurt me, Tommy.
You disappeared.

29:09.512 --> 29:11.833
And now I know why. You met Rose.

29:12.002 --> 29:15.321
She was so excited
about meeting you guys.

29:15.322 --> 29:17.137
Well, maybe you should've
told us about her

29:17.138 --> 29:19.586
before you just sprung
her on us like that.

29:20.331 --> 29:21.653
Tommy, when I heard
you were coming down,

29:21.654 --> 29:24.497
I was so excited. I couldn't
wait to show you the company

29:24.498 --> 29:26.674
and for you to get
to know Luc better.

29:28.228 --> 29:30.874
When you asked me for money,
I just got blindsided.

29:30.875 --> 29:32.191
Sarah, you don't understand.

29:32.192 --> 29:36.401
I was trying to find a way
to get back into this family.

29:40.109 --> 29:42.734
Okay. Then why don't you
come and work with me?

29:44.015 --> 29:45.217
I'm serious.

29:45.707 --> 29:48.255
Look, everything looks
great with the company.

29:48.256 --> 29:51.841
But the truth is, I am lonely.

29:52.425 --> 29:54.666
I don't even have holly
to fight with anymore.

29:55.142 --> 29:56.407
Are you serious?

29:56.651 --> 29:57.975
I mean, come on,
what could be more fun

29:57.976 --> 29:59.560
than fighting with you every day?

30:01.369 --> 30:02.820
I'll think about it.

30:05.630 --> 30:07.518
Would you think about
something else, too?

30:07.571 --> 30:08.834
Yeah, sure.

30:10.668 --> 30:12.780
I'd really like you to
walk me down the aisle.

30:15.371 --> 30:18.268
I was gonna ask you this morning,

30:18.269 --> 30:20.446
but I guess I got thrown by...

30:21.517 --> 30:22.319
Rose?

30:22.320 --> 30:23.296
Yeah.

30:23.532 --> 30:24.288
Yeah.

30:24.289 --> 30:28.517
Sarah, she's a big
part of my life now.

30:28.518 --> 30:31.718
I know that. And I am
really glad for you.

30:33.327 --> 30:35.019
And I'll try harder with Rose.
I promise.

30:35.020 --> 30:36.332
I will try much harder.

30:36.643 --> 30:39.479
I don't want you to try.

30:40.578 --> 30:42.178
I just want you to love me...

30:43.498 --> 30:44.810
Unconditionally.

30:50.393 --> 30:51.369
There.

30:52.085 --> 30:53.174
I blinked.

30:55.252 --> 30:56.485
And, yes.

30:56.771 --> 31:00.643
I would love to walk
you down the aisle.

31:03.418 --> 31:04.538
Thanks.

31:12.019 --> 31:12.964
Hey.

31:13.821 --> 31:14.797
Hey.

31:14.909 --> 31:16.238
Maybe we should head out.

31:19.151 --> 31:21.866
Justin, I think you're
taking this way too far.

31:21.867 --> 31:23.323
Yeah? See, I don't think I am.

31:24.572 --> 31:26.451
It's actually pretty simple, Annie.

31:26.945 --> 31:29.808
You didn't take my side.
And I get it. I get it.

31:29.809 --> 31:31.727
You and Rick have
this long history,

31:31.779 --> 31:33.892
and you dated for a long time,
and maybe you saw yourself

31:33.893 --> 31:36.831
ending up with him...
Wait. Do you see what you're doing here?

31:37.505 --> 31:39.610
Justin, you're picking a fight
with me just to push me away.

31:39.611 --> 31:43.726
This is about you.
Justin, I like you.

31:43.727 --> 31:44.992
And I like you. I really do. That...

31:44.993 --> 31:47.105
Then what is the problem here?

31:50.043 --> 31:52.039
Annie, I don't think
you're over him.

31:52.232 --> 31:53.272
I don't.

31:54.130 --> 31:56.070
And I think you want to
believe that you are,

31:56.071 --> 31:57.202
but you're not.

32:01.720 --> 32:02.510
So admit it.

32:02.511 --> 32:05.726
You really liked Scotty's
homemade Mac and cheese.

32:06.534 --> 32:07.679
Um, Olivia, there's something

32:07.680 --> 32:09.664
that, uh, Kevin and
I want you to hear.

32:10.542 --> 32:12.955
We have thought long and hard
about how to have a family.

32:12.956 --> 32:15.277
And we truly believe
that this is the one

32:15.278 --> 32:18.534
we're supposed to have,
but it's a big responsibility.

32:18.535 --> 32:21.143
Which is why sometimes you
may get really mad at us

32:21.144 --> 32:22.701
when we need you to do things.

32:22.702 --> 32:24.713
And we thought maybe you would
understand things better

32:24.714 --> 32:27.049
if you had something to
take care of on your own.

32:27.050 --> 32:30.885
So... is that a gecko?

32:30.886 --> 32:33.221
Mm-hmm. Is it for me?

32:33.472 --> 32:35.163
Yep. Thank you.

32:35.164 --> 32:38.281
Now you'll have to feed it.
It eats live crickets.

32:38.488 --> 32:40.715
Wow. I wish we knew
that before we got it.

32:40.716 --> 32:43.321
Yeah, and you'll have to make
sure it gets plenty of light.

32:43.322 --> 32:46.185
I will. I promise. And I'll
eat whatever you guys want.

32:46.254 --> 32:47.890
Oh, no, no, this isn't a bribe.

32:47.891 --> 32:50.855
No, because now we're a family... you,
me, Scotty, and...

32:50.856 --> 32:52.754
Zemulon. That's his name.

32:53.474 --> 32:54.420
Perfect...

32:54.421 --> 32:58.317
Because I actually have something
for his terrarium. Ahh.

32:59.018 --> 33:00.426
What's that for?

33:00.491 --> 33:01.778
Well, what does it say?

33:04.305 --> 33:06.192
Can I go play with Zemulon now?

33:09.444 --> 33:12.007
Of course you can.
I mean, nametags for geckos?

33:12.008 --> 33:14.190
That's stupid.
I think I just picked that up

33:14.191 --> 33:16.243
at a legal conference.
Can I show him our room?

33:16.244 --> 33:17.348
Sure.

33:24.026 --> 33:25.690
The shopping list. The text.

33:25.768 --> 33:27.327
She... she can't read.

33:32.982 --> 33:34.233
Oh, no, no.

33:34.234 --> 33:37.571
No, no, no, no.
You don't want to eat those.

33:38.194 --> 33:40.982
They... they've been in there
since the bush administration.

33:41.174 --> 33:42.685
Really? The first one.

33:42.686 --> 33:45.922
Oh. I am so hungry.

33:46.092 --> 33:49.138
Well, of course you are.
You've eaten nothing but salad.

33:50.132 --> 33:51.348
And...

33:51.478 --> 33:52.422
Look...

33:53.237 --> 33:55.588
Our behavior tonight
was inexcusable.

33:55.695 --> 33:58.225
You were trying to
broker a peace. I get it.

33:58.309 --> 34:01.295
No, I was trying to get you
guys to move back here.

34:01.296 --> 34:03.323
It was completely
selfish on my part.

34:03.324 --> 34:06.764
Well, I came across
kind of strong, too.

34:07.848 --> 34:10.158
I... wanted to skip that whole

34:10.292 --> 34:11.815
awkward, getting-to-know-you part

34:11.817 --> 34:14.525
and just be at that
dining room table

34:14.527 --> 34:15.855
I've heard so much about.

34:16.398 --> 34:20.621
Rose, what you saw tonight,
that's the real walkers.

34:20.643 --> 34:23.091
I mean, it's... it's not a
civil war reenactment,

34:23.092 --> 34:24.292
but it's close.

34:25.976 --> 34:28.359
How does reheated
lamb sound to you?

34:29.692 --> 34:32.092
Much better than
olives from the '90s.

34:32.096 --> 34:33.760
Yeah, I bet.

34:36.051 --> 34:38.109
You know, I-I didn't mean
to make such a big deal

34:38.110 --> 34:39.277
about that picture.

34:40.005 --> 34:42.380
No, no, no. You... No, you didn't.

34:42.431 --> 34:43.342
I just felt like...

34:43.344 --> 34:46.385
that there was a story there,
you know?

34:46.386 --> 34:48.130
I mean, did you date that guy?

34:48.585 --> 34:51.112
It... it... it was nothing, honestly.

34:51.112 --> 34:53.704
It w... it was nothing.
He just, um, I...

34:54.301 --> 34:55.873
I knew... I knew him in high school.

34:55.873 --> 34:56.804
That's... that's all.

34:56.826 --> 34:58.845
Oh, a high-school sweetheart.

34:59.121 --> 35:00.145
What's his name?

35:01.287 --> 35:02.311
Brody.

35:03.578 --> 35:05.045
His name was Brody.

35:05.767 --> 35:06.855
Hmm.

35:07.429 --> 35:08.485
Uh...

35:09.294 --> 35:09.989
Yeah.

35:10.621 --> 35:12.438
Hey. When do we eat?

35:12.439 --> 35:14.149
I am starving.

35:14.150 --> 35:15.894
Don't worry, mom. We're fine.

35:16.465 --> 35:17.292
That's right.

35:17.293 --> 35:18.753
In fact, Sarah says

35:18.754 --> 35:21.064
there might be an opening
for me at Maris media.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.536
You mean the two of you are
gonna work together again?

35:23.741 --> 35:25.937
Only if it's okay with you, Rose.

35:26.176 --> 35:27.504
Uh, oh.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.993
So what do you think,
we move down here?

35:30.401 --> 35:34.093
Um... you can't just put her
on the spot like that, Tommy.

35:35.634 --> 35:36.593
Rose?

35:41.126 --> 35:42.198
Let's do it.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.687
Let's move to Pasadena.

35:44.545 --> 35:48.063
Oh, my God. This is fantastic.
Oh! I can't believe it!

35:48.064 --> 35:49.265
Come here, mom.

35:50.064 --> 35:52.943
This calls for a celebration.

36:00.879 --> 36:03.855
Hey. Where is she?

36:03.880 --> 36:04.937
She's getting ready.

36:04.938 --> 36:07.113
I think she wants to impress us.

36:07.339 --> 36:10.185
Impress us? My God.
I'm a nervous wreck.

36:10.186 --> 36:12.009
I could hardly sleep last night.

36:12.749 --> 36:14.927
Midnight is a young man's game.

36:14.928 --> 36:16.404
You know, he's in the phone book.

36:17.925 --> 36:18.392
Who?

36:18.393 --> 36:20.409
Brody. Brody's in the phone book.

36:20.410 --> 36:22.315
I remembered,
Brody is his last name.

36:22.504 --> 36:24.081
His name is Nick Brody.

36:24.082 --> 36:26.118
Saul, would you just please stop it?
You're obsessed.

36:26.119 --> 36:28.025
Nora, I think that
you should call him.

36:28.026 --> 36:29.355
Yeah, yeah, you were
very close to him.

36:29.356 --> 36:32.677
Much closer than any of us ever knew.
Stop it. Honestly.

36:32.678 --> 36:35.542
I'd just like to
concentrate on... on today.

36:35.587 --> 36:38.052
I'm about to meet my new
little granddaughter

36:38.053 --> 36:40.794
for the very first time, and I
want to concentrate on that. Okay.

36:42.036 --> 36:44.126
Hi. She's almost ready.

36:44.879 --> 36:46.591
Don't be mad at me if I cry.

36:48.532 --> 36:49.396
Please tell me

36:49.397 --> 36:50.997
there aren't any
leftovers in there.

36:51.615 --> 36:52.992
No, they're not leftovers.

36:52.993 --> 36:56.501
I-I brought a-a bunch
of your favorite books

36:56.502 --> 36:57.845
from when you were a kid.

36:57.846 --> 37:00.859
That's great. Thank you. So did
you talk to the social worker?

37:00.860 --> 37:03.005
Yeah, I did. A lot of kids
fall through the cracks.

37:03.006 --> 37:05.232
So we've made an appointment
to get her tested,

37:05.233 --> 37:07.734
and now we're just looking
for tutors. Great.

37:08.310 --> 37:11.574
Kevin... you sound just like a dad.

37:11.575 --> 37:13.976
Oh, stop it.
You're gonna make me cry.

37:15.784 --> 37:16.920
Olivia,

37:17.350 --> 37:20.443
this is Kevin's mom, Nora.

37:22.810 --> 37:24.184
Hi, Olivia.

37:24.664 --> 37:26.664
And this is Uncle Saul.

37:26.705 --> 37:29.281
Hi, sweetheart.
I'm so happy to meet you.

37:29.745 --> 37:31.128
Thank you for my phone, Nora.

37:31.129 --> 37:33.157
Oh, absolutely.
I mean, if you're gonna be

37:33.158 --> 37:34.653
in this family,
you gotta have a phone.

37:34.668 --> 37:35.756
And you have to learn that

37:35.757 --> 37:38.766
whole 3-way calling thing.
I know how to do it.

37:38.796 --> 37:41.130
Ooh. Do you want to meet my gecko?

37:41.434 --> 37:42.842
Y-your gecko?

37:43.318 --> 37:47.014
Oh, wow. Look at that.
Wow. Whoo-hoo-hoo.

37:49.008 --> 37:53.453
Oh... my goodness.
And what's his name?

37:53.569 --> 37:54.496
Zemulon.

37:55.009 --> 37:56.072
Zemulon?

37:57.658 --> 37:58.239
Wow.

37:58.240 --> 38:00.641
Look at that tail. Amazing.

38:05.310 --> 38:06.174
Hey.

38:06.774 --> 38:07.607
Hey.

38:07.632 --> 38:08.896
Hi. How's your day going?

38:09.203 --> 38:10.677
Um, good, good.

38:10.678 --> 38:13.046
Definitely better than
how my night went.

38:14.244 --> 38:14.868
Hey, Justin,

38:14.869 --> 38:18.096
I just need to talk to you
about something. Yeah, sure.

38:18.106 --> 38:21.192
I just want you to know that
I never meant to lead you on.

38:21.193 --> 38:22.667
You know, and I-I'm not saying

38:22.668 --> 38:24.946
that I'm gonna get back
together with Rick. I just...

38:24.947 --> 38:28.162
Annie, stop. I get it. It's okay.

38:30.533 --> 38:32.507
I really, really like you, Justin.

38:32.508 --> 38:36.723
And I don't know,
maybe this is too much to ask,

38:36.724 --> 38:40.435
but I just hope that we
can still be friends.

38:40.436 --> 38:41.412
Yeah.

38:43.410 --> 38:45.330
Yeah, you know, eventually.

38:45.807 --> 38:48.405
Of course. Right. So, um...

38:48.406 --> 38:49.734
So I'll, uh...

38:52.547 --> 38:54.259
I'll see you around, Annie.

38:58.275 --> 38:59.810
Justin, um,

38:59.811 --> 39:01.141
just one more thing.

39:03.036 --> 39:05.308
I think you might have been safe.

39:07.392 --> 39:08.676
I appreciate that.

39:10.774 --> 39:12.054
Bye, Annie.

39:18.835 --> 39:21.118
What, you're not still doing
that family tree thing,

39:21.119 --> 39:21.710
are you?

39:21.711 --> 39:24.308
You wouldn't believe the stuff
you can download online...

39:25.069 --> 39:26.727
birth certificates... mwah... mwah.

39:26.728 --> 39:30.001
Marriage certificates,
immigration papers.

39:30.572 --> 39:33.324
Seriously. What did we
do before the Internet?

39:33.524 --> 39:35.113
Ah, hold on.

39:36.730 --> 39:39.827
Hello. Uh, hey. Listen,
I know I said that we'd meet up

39:39.828 --> 39:41.972
at the office this morning,
but, um... whoa, whoa.

39:42.011 --> 39:43.459
You're not having second thoughts,

39:43.460 --> 39:46.279
are you? About working together? No.
No, not at all.

39:46.280 --> 39:48.143
No, no, it's just that, um,

39:48.654 --> 39:50.401
have you ever had one
of those mornings

39:50.402 --> 39:53.412
where you feel like you just
shouldn't get out of bed?

39:53.427 --> 39:54.734
Yeah, all the time.

39:55.128 --> 39:56.458
Yes, well, I am

39:56.459 --> 39:59.321
definitely having one
of those mornings.

39:59.322 --> 40:02.169
Sarah, it's fine. Say hi to Luc.

40:02.170 --> 40:04.026
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
What I was thinking is,

40:04.027 --> 40:05.910
why don't you come over for lunch,

40:05.911 --> 40:08.089
you and Rose? 
Yeah, yeah. That's great.

40:08.090 --> 40:10.063
Okay, give me a few hours, okay?

40:10.064 --> 40:11.681
Okay. Bye.

40:12.318 --> 40:15.520
Hey. Do you think it would be weird

40:15.521 --> 40:18.000
if we got married the same
month your mother did?

40:18.029 --> 40:19.549
Ooh. I don't think
we want to start out

40:19.550 --> 40:20.979
with that kind of karma. Mm.

40:20.980 --> 40:23.830
Too bad. I always
wanted a June wedding.

40:24.313 --> 40:27.443
You still can. My parents
got married in January.

40:27.923 --> 40:32.145
Uh... Tommy, I'm looking at
the marriage certificate.

40:32.698 --> 40:33.930
It says June.

40:34.708 --> 40:35.657
Oh.

40:35.960 --> 40:37.879
No, no, th-this can't be right.

40:38.113 --> 40:40.595
I mean, I can't tell
you how many times

40:40.596 --> 40:43.364
we went to Chasen's for
their anniversary party.

40:44.146 --> 40:46.938
Did she ever tell you
about a guy named Brody?

40:48.339 --> 40:49.730
N-no. Why?

40:51.901 --> 40:53.035
Uh...

40:53.164 --> 40:55.132
I'm not really sure.

40:55.374 --> 40:56.846
Maybe you should ask her.

40:58.021 --> 40:59.582
Where I come from,
there's only one reason

40:59.583 --> 41:01.371
people lie about
their wedding date.

41:01.372 --> 41:04.156
What, you think she was pregnant? 
Maybe.
