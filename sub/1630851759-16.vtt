00:13.430 --> 00:15.531
noodle, that was your
best performance yet.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.700
And the place is so packed,
I couldn't tell which one

00:17.818 --> 00:19.935
of your adoring fans
was yelling "woo-hoo!"

00:20.037 --> 00:23.489
-it was you, dad.
-No wonder he was so loud.

00:25.242 --> 00:27.209
I bet they're all here
because of my new music profile.

00:27.328 --> 00:28.994
I've been getting
a lot of new followers.

00:29.080 --> 00:32.214
That's because of her
incredibly talented,

00:32.299 --> 00:35.250
brilliant and humble
social media manager.

00:36.787 --> 00:39.054
Come on, max,
let's let her hang
with the cool kids.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.756
And by that,
I mean not you.

00:46.130 --> 00:49.932
Hi, sydney? I'm zoey.
I just wanted to say

00:50.017 --> 00:52.317
you like totes killed
that performance.

00:52.403 --> 00:54.570
Your songs slap, girl.

00:54.688 --> 00:57.523
I'm kind of a stan.

00:57.608 --> 00:59.191
Wow.

00:59.276 --> 01:01.577
Thanks, I've always
wanted a stan.

01:01.662 --> 01:04.913
Yaasss, and I am def
not the only one.

01:04.999 --> 01:09.618
There was some guy
yelling "woo-hoo" throughout
the whole performance.

01:10.955 --> 01:13.622
So you were saying
you're a stan?

01:14.708 --> 01:18.427
Huge. I'm also a brand manager
at britney nashville.

01:18.546 --> 01:19.762
Have you guys heard of us?

01:19.847 --> 01:21.513
Are you kidding?
I love your clothes.

01:21.599 --> 01:23.498
I'm obsessed
with britney nashville.

01:23.601 --> 01:26.552
Britney nashville girls
take up half of my
social media feed.

01:26.670 --> 01:29.304
The other half is animals
dressed as celebrities.

01:29.440 --> 01:31.640
My favorite
is scarlett jo-hamster.

01:33.277 --> 01:35.677
So sydney,

How would you like to be an

01:43.821 --> 01:47.573
Me? A britney nashville girl?
I've always wanted to be one.

01:47.691 --> 01:48.707
How does this work?

01:48.859 --> 01:50.859
Mostly, we send you
a bunch of free clothes

01:50.961 --> 01:52.711
and you post pics
wearing them.

01:52.830 --> 01:56.715
Okay, let me consult

01:58.002 --> 02:00.219

hey, max. Bad news.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.772
I just got an e-mail
from cousin archie,

02:53.924 --> 02:56.275
his birthday party
is coming up in two weeks.

02:56.393 --> 02:58.760
Oh, seriously?
He's so obnoxious.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.779
Remember last year
when he made us all play

03:00.898 --> 03:02.064
pin the tail on the archie?

03:02.116 --> 03:05.117
I won, but the prize
was a full body pillow of him.

03:05.236 --> 03:06.785
So really, I lost.

03:07.655 --> 03:09.154
I can't do another
one of his parties.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.372
Well, what are we going to do?

03:10.457 --> 03:11.957
If we don't go,
we'll never hear
the end of it.

03:12.076 --> 03:13.659
Or we can say
we can't make it

03:13.777 --> 03:16.111
because we already planned
a vacation together.

03:16.163 --> 03:17.579
Wow. Sounds like
a really expensive way

03:17.665 --> 03:18.714
to get out of a party,

03:18.799 --> 03:20.299
but it's archie,
so I'm in.

03:20.417 --> 03:21.783
Not a real one.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.952
We'll just take some
fake pics of us on vacation

03:24.004 --> 03:25.120
and post them online.

03:25.222 --> 03:26.388
He'll never know
the difference.

03:26.473 --> 03:27.589
You really think that'll work?

03:27.675 --> 03:29.841
Please. I've gotten out
of two weddings

03:29.960 --> 03:33.345
and a baby shower
by "going to australia."

03:35.266 --> 03:37.816
so that's why there was
a kangaroo in our backyard.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.104
Hey, dad, did I just
hear the doorbell?

03:42.189 --> 03:44.606
Syd, you've asked me
five times already.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.441
Don't worry, your clothes
will get here soon.

03:47.444 --> 03:48.827
What if they
changed their mind?

03:48.979 --> 03:50.579
What if zoey decided
another girl

03:50.664 --> 03:52.447
was more britney nashville
than I am?

03:52.533 --> 03:53.448
(doorbell rings)

03:53.534 --> 03:54.783
ah! It's here!

03:54.868 --> 03:56.335
Take that, other girl.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.923
Hi, I'm from britney nashville.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.008
This is the greatest
day of my life.

04:03.127 --> 04:04.676
I get that a lot.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.632
Wow. Even the box
is cooler than me,

04:10.718 --> 04:12.517
and that's not true
of most packages.

04:13.554 --> 04:14.669
Oh, I gotta text olive.

04:14.772 --> 04:16.671
I promised I'd wait
to open it with her.

04:16.774 --> 04:17.773
(doorbell rings)

04:21.061 --> 04:22.561
it's here, it's here!

04:22.679 --> 04:24.863
Olive, were you following
the delivery truck?

04:25.015 --> 04:27.566
Of course not.
I was hiding in the bushes.

04:32.139 --> 04:35.290
Whoa, is that
the wrestler, mr. Concrete?

04:35.376 --> 04:38.043
He must be in town for
the big ruckus rumble event.

04:38.145 --> 04:39.911
I can't believe he's here.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.364
He's one of the best
pro wrestlers of all time.

04:42.466 --> 04:45.000
One of? He is the best.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.919
He beat the venomous viper
by breaking a stool on him,

04:48.038 --> 04:49.972
then a chair, then a table.

04:50.057 --> 04:52.641
All right, personally, I think
the table was overkill.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.345
Wait, you watch wrestling?

04:56.430 --> 04:58.230
Are you kidding?
My favorite day of the year

04:58.349 --> 04:59.714
is when the ruckus rumble is on.

04:59.767 --> 05:02.100
I can't believe
it's only two weeks away.

05:02.202 --> 05:03.869
I'm so psyched to watch it.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.270
I'm going to go
get his autograph.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.858
Mr. Concrete,
would you mind
signing this

05:09.910 --> 05:11.893
and making it out
to alisha, your biggest fan?

05:11.945 --> 05:13.829
I'd be happy to, alisha.

05:15.399 --> 05:18.917
Man, everyone looks up
to mr. Concrete,

05:19.069 --> 05:20.735
especially alisha.

05:20.838 --> 05:23.005
I wish I had muscles
like that guy.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.207
Personally, I'm happy
with my body.

05:25.292 --> 05:27.759
I got arms to lift
a laptop, legs to dance,

05:27.878 --> 05:29.294
and a face that won't quit.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.014
I gotta bulk up.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.433
I know I can't look
like mr. Concrete,

05:34.584 --> 05:37.252
but that doesn't mean
I can't get some muscles.

05:37.304 --> 05:40.588
True, but it takes a lot
of hard work and dedication.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.941
Which are two things
I've been meaning to try.

05:44.061 --> 05:45.427
Well, if you're
willing to commit,

05:45.529 --> 05:46.728
I could be your trainer.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.363
Really, you can do that?

05:48.449 --> 05:50.148
Yeah, I helped
my uncle get in shape

05:50.267 --> 05:51.599
for a bodybuilding competition.

05:51.702 --> 05:52.734
Did he win?

05:52.820 --> 05:54.319
Yeah, but unfortunately,

05:54.438 --> 05:56.321
he hurt his back
lifting the trophy.

06:01.712 --> 06:03.829
What are you waiting for?
Open it, open it!

06:04.832 --> 06:06.114
I can't believe this.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.417
Britney nashville girls
always look so perfect.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.168
I never thought
I'd be one of them.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.421
And I never thought
I'd be besties with
one of them

06:12.506 --> 06:14.639
and get to share
all her free clothes!

06:15.625 --> 06:16.725
We'll circle back.

06:18.395 --> 06:22.848
Ooh, look at these tops
and this skirt.

06:22.966 --> 06:26.318
And the most amazing jumpsuit

06:26.470 --> 06:28.236
I have ever seen.

06:28.322 --> 06:30.072
Syd, that is so you.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.190
Well, I am a britney
nashville girl.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.809
And look, the best part
is all the clothes

06:34.862 --> 06:36.311
are one size fits all.

06:36.363 --> 06:38.080
That means everything
is going to fit.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.084
Well, not everything.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.086
It's a little tight
in the front.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.287
Let me see the back.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.925
Okay, I'm starting
to like the front better.

06:51.378 --> 06:52.627
Try on something else.

06:55.048 --> 06:59.217
Sleeves too big.
Pants too long.

07:01.271 --> 07:02.854
Skirt too tight.

07:06.093 --> 07:10.362
Too much neck.
Nothing they sent fits me.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.398
I thought their clothes
were supposed to fit everyone.

07:14.368 --> 07:16.651
Maybe we can build
an outfit around this.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.069
A bracelet?

07:19.373 --> 07:20.822
At least that fits.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.041
What's wrong with me?

07:23.160 --> 07:24.626
How can I be
a britney nashville girl

07:24.711 --> 07:27.078
if the only thing
that fits is this bracelet?

07:29.416 --> 07:30.999
Aw, come on.

07:34.922 --> 07:36.822
I don't get it.
I thought britney nashville

07:36.924 --> 07:38.607
was supposed to be
one size fits all.

07:38.659 --> 07:39.991
What am I going to do?

07:40.143 --> 07:42.661
I promised zoey I'd post
pics in these clothes.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.979
I guess you'll just have
to tell her they don't fit.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.998
And give up being
a britney nashville girl?

07:47.117 --> 07:48.250
No way.

07:48.335 --> 07:49.984
Hey, girls,
your dad and I

07:50.037 --> 07:51.920
are about to take pictures
for our fake vacation.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.623
Do either of you have
a large rubber lobster?

07:54.708 --> 07:57.425
Sorry, I got fresh or frozen.
No rubber.

07:58.212 --> 07:59.827
Okay, forget the lobster.

07:59.930 --> 08:02.681
What about a life-size
inflatable shark?

08:02.799 --> 08:05.767
What kind of terrifying
vacation is this?

08:06.970 --> 08:09.604
Hey, you have
your dream vacay,
I have mine.

08:11.725 --> 08:12.891
Syd, what are you
going to do?

08:13.009 --> 08:14.509
You still have to
post those pictures.

08:14.611 --> 08:16.010
You know what?

08:16.113 --> 08:19.314
Grandma's fake vacation
photo shoot gave me an idea.

08:20.350 --> 08:23.068
I don't actually have to
fit into the clothes,

08:23.186 --> 08:25.237
I just have to
look like I do.

08:25.355 --> 08:27.455
And I don't actually
have to understand

08:27.541 --> 08:30.375
what you're talking about,
I just have to look like I do.

08:36.049 --> 08:39.634
Okay, max, for the next
two weeks, don't think
of me as your friend, leo.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.303
I'm your trainer, coach webb.

08:41.388 --> 08:43.054
And coach webb
takes no mercy.

08:45.259 --> 08:47.926
But if he gets too rough,
your buddy leo can talk to him.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.346
Let's do this.
I invited alisha

08:51.398 --> 08:53.315
over for
the ruckus rumble
in two weeks,

08:53.400 --> 08:55.400
and I want to impress her
with my new muscles.

08:55.519 --> 08:56.718
Not a lot of time,

08:56.770 --> 08:58.937
but if you listen
to every word I say,
we got this.

08:59.055 --> 09:00.655
All right. What do you
want to focus on?

09:00.741 --> 09:04.075
Mostly my tri-tips
and my trapezoids.

09:04.194 --> 09:06.912
Really want to get
my en-dolphins flowing.

09:07.030 --> 09:10.999
Okay, tri-tips are steaks,
trapezoids are shapes,

09:11.084 --> 09:14.035
and en-dolphins are...
Well, they're just dolphins.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.086
(door opens)

09:18.759 --> 09:21.259
two questions,
what's going on here?

09:21.378 --> 09:23.678
And two, do I
even want to know?

09:24.748 --> 09:26.181
I'm getting buff.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.767
Is this because
I laughed when you couldn't
lift the meatloaf?

09:28.885 --> 09:31.603
You told me it was
stuck to the counter.

09:32.756 --> 09:34.889
And no, I'm doing this
for other reasons.

09:34.942 --> 09:37.525
-Alisha?
-Ding, ding.
We have a winner.

09:39.429 --> 09:41.929
Max, do you really think
this is what girls like?

09:41.982 --> 09:44.866
Don't you think they prefer
someone sensitive who listens?

09:44.952 --> 09:47.285
Ew, why would they want that?

09:48.455 --> 09:50.121
It's a good thing you're cute.

09:52.376 --> 09:54.576
Last thing, we got to
track your progress

09:54.628 --> 09:56.444
to make sure you're going
from scrawny to brawny.

09:56.546 --> 09:57.963
(door closes)

09:58.081 --> 09:59.447
how's it looking?

09:59.499 --> 10:01.750
Like we need to get started
sooner rather than later.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.170
Okay, max, let's see
your bicep curls.

10:09.459 --> 10:11.977
Okay, let's see a bicep curl.

10:14.297 --> 10:17.482
Max, this medicine ball
is much heavier than it looks.

10:17.601 --> 10:19.351
Yeah, yeah,
just throw it already.

10:20.103 --> 10:21.236
-Oh.
-(thud)

10:23.907 --> 10:26.107
you think we could swing
by the supermarket?

10:26.159 --> 10:28.576
This ice cream could
really use some sprinkles.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.029
Okay, max, say, uh,

10:31.147 --> 10:33.981
"getting out of archie's dumb
party with a fake vacation."

10:34.084 --> 10:35.967
you really think archie
is worth all that?

10:36.069 --> 10:37.485
Good point.

10:37.537 --> 10:38.870
Both: Cheese.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.305
(phone camera clicks)

10:40.374 --> 10:43.341
you know, I thought after this
we could ride fake jet skis.

10:43.460 --> 10:47.161
What's your rush? This is nice,
sitting here relaxing with you.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.314
You know what, it is.

10:49.416 --> 10:52.133
Here's to lying
on the beach.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.802
(chuckles)

10:53.887 --> 10:56.304
both: (slurp) mm. Ah.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.607
You know what, I'm going
to go order room service.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.693
You mean you want me
to make dinner and bring it
to your room?

11:01.812 --> 11:02.894
Just leave it by the door.

11:04.531 --> 11:06.681
Whoa, noodle, looking good.

11:06.733 --> 11:07.866
Thanks, grandma.

11:07.984 --> 11:09.784
Hey, are those
the britney nashville clothes?

11:09.870 --> 11:11.453
Yeah, we're about
to do a photo shoot.

11:11.538 --> 11:13.455
Uh, why don't we shoot
against the wall?

11:14.541 --> 11:15.957
You know, I'm not up on
all the latest trends,

11:16.043 --> 11:18.576
but do all the cool clothes
have chip clips on the back?

11:20.247 --> 11:22.047
Technically,
the clothes don't fit me.

11:22.165 --> 11:23.865
So we're just going to
fake it for some photos.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.032
Well, if the clothes don't fit,

11:25.135 --> 11:26.534
then why are you going
to all this trouble?

11:26.586 --> 11:29.137
It's a big deal to be chosen
to represent this brand.

11:29.222 --> 11:32.540
It could give me exposure
and do a lot for my career.

11:32.592 --> 11:34.041
Yeah, but is it really worth it

11:34.094 --> 11:35.894
if you have to pretend
to be something you're not?

11:36.012 --> 11:37.979
Says the man wearing
a tropical shirt

11:38.065 --> 11:39.564
and drinking out of a coconut.

11:40.717 --> 11:42.016
Well, this is--

11:42.102 --> 11:44.486
you know, I've got
some room service to deliver.

11:46.356 --> 11:49.056
All right, future influencer,
let's shoot some pics.

11:49.159 --> 11:49.991
(door closes)

11:57.451 --> 11:59.901
uh, syd, your face
looks a little weird.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.587
It's 'cause the chip clips
are digging into my back.

12:03.373 --> 12:04.539
(sighs)

12:04.624 --> 12:06.207
why don't I sit down?

12:13.216 --> 12:14.632
Standing it is.

12:17.304 --> 12:20.271
(phone camera clicks)

12:20.390 --> 12:22.474
okay, let's check them out.

12:23.610 --> 12:26.093
I don't know, the outfit
still doesn't look good on me.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.979
Well, that's easy to fix.

12:28.097 --> 12:30.782
We'll just smooth your sides,

12:30.901 --> 12:33.601
adjust your legs,
move your arms,

12:33.703 --> 12:36.988
contour your face
and throw on a filter.

12:37.106 --> 12:39.240
Are you sure we should
be doing all that?

12:39.326 --> 12:41.209
Maybe my dad was right.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.628
Feels like we're lying
about how I look.

12:45.916 --> 12:48.416
Whoa, I look good!

12:51.955 --> 12:57.308
Eighteen, 19, 20.

12:57.460 --> 12:59.344
Let's see how big
your muscles are.

12:59.462 --> 13:02.480
Yeah, it's all
about the gains, bro.

13:02.599 --> 13:04.566
We'll see what
the tape measure says.

13:06.436 --> 13:08.636
You know what?
Forget about the tape.

13:08.688 --> 13:11.573
The important thing is
you believe you're bigger.

13:12.692 --> 13:13.775
It didn't go up?

13:13.860 --> 13:15.827
The good news is
it didn't go down.

13:16.813 --> 13:19.164
What? But I worked so hard.

13:19.282 --> 13:21.666
Alisha's coming over for
the ruckus rumble tomorrow.

13:21.785 --> 13:23.334
I'll never impress her now.

13:23.486 --> 13:25.453
I wish there was
some way to fake it,

13:25.539 --> 13:28.173
but it's not like you can
just slap on some muscles.

13:29.125 --> 13:32.660
That's genius. I'll just
slap on some muscles.

13:32.712 --> 13:35.129
As coach webb,
I'm disappointed.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.515
As your friend leo,
why didn't I see that coming?

13:39.519 --> 13:42.687
Did you see how many likes
these new pics are getting, syd?

13:42.823 --> 13:44.806
I did. People are
commenting on me

13:44.891 --> 13:47.642
like I used to comment
on britney nashville girls.

13:47.727 --> 13:49.176
Wow. What's next?

13:49.229 --> 13:53.514
Your own signature fragrance,
sydney by sydney.

13:53.567 --> 13:56.951
It smells like
lavender, sandalwood,

13:57.037 --> 13:59.353
and a hint of ranch dressing.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.322
What? I'm hungry.

14:02.692 --> 14:06.027
And all we had to do
was filter a few pictures.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.880
Oh, did you see what zoey
commented on the last one?

14:08.999 --> 14:12.033
"no cap, your drip
is straight fire.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.869
Pull out a rake
'cause this is so leafy."

14:14.921 --> 14:16.971
I always knew I was leafy.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.539
You don't know
what it means either, do you?

14:18.592 --> 14:20.525
Not a clue.

14:20.594 --> 14:22.176
(doorbell rings)

14:24.431 --> 14:27.599
oh, my gosh, another
britney nashville box? Thanks.

14:27.717 --> 14:30.351
Of course,
keep crushing it.

14:36.610 --> 14:39.410
"thought you could rock this
dress from our new collection.

14:40.697 --> 14:44.782
Can't wait to see you wear it
at your next show. Xo, zoey."

14:45.952 --> 14:49.037
she wants to see me wearing
this dress... In person.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.923
As in no smoothing,
no contouring, no filters?

14:52.042 --> 14:54.592
Yep, but it's not
going to fit.

14:54.744 --> 14:56.544
None of their stuff fits.

14:56.630 --> 14:59.597
Once they find out, no more
being a britney nashville girl.

14:59.749 --> 15:01.099
So what are you
going to do?

15:01.250 --> 15:04.068
Well, if the dress
doesn't fit me,

15:04.170 --> 15:07.055
I'll have to make myself
fit into the dress.

15:12.379 --> 15:15.129
What a great run, olive.

15:15.231 --> 15:17.215
Doesn't it make you feel alive?

15:17.317 --> 15:22.604
(panting) I... Want to... Die.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.690
Don't worry, we're done.

15:26.610 --> 15:28.809
So, tomorrow night
is my performance

15:28.912 --> 15:31.946
and I should be able to squeeze
into the dress zoey sent by now.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.665
Now come on,
let's go up to my room.

15:34.918 --> 15:36.334
You coming?

15:36.453 --> 15:39.754
Is it too much to ask you
to move your room downstairs?

15:44.044 --> 15:47.045
Good news, I finally
got it zipped.

15:47.163 --> 15:49.013
(strained):
Bad news, I can't breathe.

15:50.016 --> 15:51.316
Syd, how are you
going to sing in that dress

15:51.384 --> 15:52.467
if you can't breathe?

15:52.519 --> 15:54.469
Breathing's overrated.

15:55.672 --> 15:58.106
And those sleeves are
so tight, how are you
going to strum the guitar?

16:02.228 --> 16:03.895
Strumming is overrated.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.148
How are you going
to walk on stage?

16:09.202 --> 16:11.402
Okay, I'm beginning
to think this doesn't fit.

16:12.872 --> 16:15.540
But I still have time.
I can squeeze in a long run.

16:15.659 --> 16:17.208
Syd, you're going too far.

16:17.327 --> 16:18.876
It's one thing
to filter some pictures,

16:18.995 --> 16:21.162
but to change the way
you look in real life?

16:22.215 --> 16:23.581
You're right, olive.

16:24.884 --> 16:27.635
Why am I pushing myself
to fit someone else's idea

16:27.721 --> 16:29.087
of how I should look?

16:29.889 --> 16:31.372
Britney nashville
shouldn't get to decide

16:31.424 --> 16:33.874
what size is right
for all girls.

16:33.927 --> 16:37.044
Yeah, we think these britney
nashville girls are perfect,

16:37.147 --> 16:40.314
but I bet they filter
their pictures just
like we did.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.434
You know what?
My body isn't the problem.

16:43.553 --> 16:45.486
I like it just the way it is.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.522
The problem is these clothes.

16:47.574 --> 16:50.024
I mean, this isn't a dress.
It's a long t-shirt.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.726
And this isn't a skirt.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.244
It's one leg
of a pair of shorts.

16:53.363 --> 16:55.113
And this isn't
a tube top. It's a--

16:56.032 --> 16:57.615
oh, wait, yeah,
that is a tube top.

16:59.536 --> 17:00.752
So what are you going to do?

17:00.870 --> 17:03.070
Zoey's expecting you to wear
their clothes at your show.

17:03.173 --> 17:05.790
(sighs) hmm.

17:08.211 --> 17:11.012
I said I'd wear them...
And I will.

17:11.097 --> 17:13.831
Well, whatever
your plan is,
I'm on board.

17:13.933 --> 17:15.266
Wait, does it
involve running?

17:15.385 --> 17:17.468
-No.
-Good, then I'm on board.

17:21.274 --> 17:23.558
Come on, max!
Alisha's going to be here

17:23.643 --> 17:25.426
any minute to watch
the ruckus rumble.

17:25.478 --> 17:26.811
Let's see those biceps.

17:29.983 --> 17:31.115
Oh.

17:33.936 --> 17:35.570
Look at these guys,

17:35.655 --> 17:37.789
you can't even tell
they're balled-up tube socks.

17:37.940 --> 17:40.992
I'd never know the difference
if it wasn't for the stench.

17:42.045 --> 17:43.077
(doorbell rings)

17:43.163 --> 17:44.078
there she is.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.785
-Hey, max.
-Alisha, so happy
you're here.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.787
Where do you want
to watch the match?

17:53.456 --> 17:57.058
In the basement...
Or on the couch?

17:58.961 --> 18:01.896
Max, you look... Different.

18:01.981 --> 18:05.233
Oh, (chuckles) these bad boys?

18:05.318 --> 18:07.635
Eh, I've been
working out a little.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.637
Okay, why don't
the three of us

18:09.739 --> 18:12.523
and those "bad boys" sit down
and watch the match.

18:15.311 --> 18:18.996
Hey, max, I can't find
any of your tube socks.

18:21.034 --> 18:23.668
Oh. Never mind.

18:25.538 --> 18:29.207
Sorry, I hope there's room
for me and my muscles.

18:30.493 --> 18:32.743
Max, why is your
muscle upside-down?

18:32.846 --> 18:34.428
Huh? What?

18:35.765 --> 18:42.303
Oh, uh, sometimes when they're
so strong, they need to rest.

18:44.507 --> 18:47.608
I'm going to go to the kitchen
and pretend this isn't awkward.

18:50.730 --> 18:53.447
Max, why are you
wearing fake muscles?

18:53.533 --> 18:54.849
You knew?

18:54.901 --> 18:57.285
I could tell from
the second I walked in.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.120
Then why didn't
you say anything?

18:59.205 --> 19:01.021
I didn't want to hurt
your feelings.

19:01.074 --> 19:03.791
I tried my best
to get real muscles, but...

19:04.794 --> 19:06.193
I just couldn't.

19:06.246 --> 19:07.712
Why would you do that?

19:07.831 --> 19:11.999
Well... I guess because
I've always felt so scrawny.

19:13.086 --> 19:15.887
And girls like muscles,
don't they?

19:16.038 --> 19:18.756
I mean, you like wrestlers.

19:21.928 --> 19:25.680
Max, I like wrestling
because it's silly and fun.

19:25.732 --> 19:28.900
And it's a great excuse
to scream at the tv.

19:30.854 --> 19:32.386
Max, the best part about you

19:32.488 --> 19:34.488
is you always flex
your biggest muscle...

19:35.608 --> 19:37.057
Your heart.

19:37.160 --> 19:38.609
Thanks, alisha.

19:39.696 --> 19:40.828
That means a lot.

19:40.914 --> 19:42.563
You ready to watch the match?

19:42.615 --> 19:43.781
Let's do it.

19:44.901 --> 19:45.750
(tv turns on, crowd cheers)

19:45.902 --> 19:47.919
rip his head off,
mr. Concrete!

19:48.070 --> 19:52.123
Rip it off! Rip! It! Off!

19:54.243 --> 19:55.626
This is nice.

20:00.049 --> 20:02.433
Syd, zoey just walked in.

20:02.585 --> 20:04.101
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

20:04.220 --> 20:06.437
Well, I was sure until
you asked if I was sure.

20:06.589 --> 20:08.222
-Now I'm not so sure.
-You should be sure.

20:08.308 --> 20:09.440
-You sure?
-I'm sure.

20:10.810 --> 20:11.926
You're right.

20:12.028 --> 20:14.896
I have to do this,
not just for me,

20:14.948 --> 20:17.114
but for every other girl
who's felt bad about themselves

20:17.233 --> 20:19.033
trying on britney
nashville clothes.

20:20.236 --> 20:21.452
(sighs)

20:21.604 --> 20:23.237
here goes nothing.

20:24.791 --> 20:27.441
Hey, olive.
I am so amped

20:27.543 --> 20:29.660
to see syd slay
in our dress.

20:29.779 --> 20:32.296
I'm going to take
so many pics for our grid.

20:32.415 --> 20:35.299
It's going to be very leafy.

20:35.418 --> 20:37.001
Whoa.

20:37.119 --> 20:39.587
Crispy use of leafy.

20:42.926 --> 20:45.626
And now the star
of our show, you know her,

20:45.728 --> 20:47.294
you love her,
and I raised her,

20:47.397 --> 20:49.430
sydney reynolds! Woo-hoo!

20:49.515 --> 20:53.184
(cheers and applause)

20:53.302 --> 20:55.903
o.M.G. What is she wearing?

20:57.023 --> 20:58.305
Britney nashville.

20:58.408 --> 20:59.907
The whole store?

21:01.277 --> 21:03.494
<i> ♪ how can I say this? ♪</i>

21:03.613 --> 21:05.279
<i> ♪ my hands are shaking ♪</i>

21:05.365 --> 21:07.615
<i> ♪ I feel the weight</i>
<i> all around ♪</i>

21:08.534 --> 21:14.338
<i> ♪ I want to see the world</i>
<i> and meet the girl</i>
<i> I'm becoming ♪</i>

21:14.457 --> 21:17.658
<i>♪ but I don't want</i>
<i>to leave you behind ♪</i>

21:17.710 --> 21:19.710
(cheers and applause)

21:21.631 --> 21:23.431
I'm so proud of you.

21:27.303 --> 21:28.469
Sydney.

21:28.521 --> 21:31.889
Look... I'm sorry
I cut up the clothes.

21:32.008 --> 21:35.309
I thought all I wanted was to be
a britney nashville girl,

21:35.361 --> 21:38.696
but I realized
I'm not one-size-fits-all.

21:38.848 --> 21:40.781
I'm one-of-a-kind.

21:40.867 --> 21:43.150
And so is every other girl.

21:43.236 --> 21:45.019
Syd, it's chill.

21:45.121 --> 21:46.487
I'm not salty.

21:46.539 --> 21:50.791
This isn't exactly on brand,
but points were made.

21:51.861 --> 21:54.962
-Really?
-Tbh, if you
want the real tea...

21:55.915 --> 21:57.498
The clothes
don't fit me either.

21:57.583 --> 22:00.084
See? Samesies.

22:00.202 --> 22:01.752
Then why don't
you say anything?

22:01.871 --> 22:06.223
I guess I didn't think I could,
but you've given me such inspo,

22:06.375 --> 22:08.208
I'm going to bring it up
in our next design sesh.

22:08.261 --> 22:09.477
Thanks, syd.

22:10.546 --> 22:11.712
Back off, zoey.

22:11.814 --> 22:13.514
Syd tried to fit
into your clothes

22:13.599 --> 22:14.732
but it was impossible.

22:14.851 --> 22:16.767
Olive, zoey totally gets it.

22:17.770 --> 22:22.023
Oh. Then as her
social media manager,

22:22.075 --> 22:24.241
I'd like to say thank you
for this opportunity.

22:24.377 --> 22:25.743
Saved it.

22:30.616 --> 22:32.199
Posting more pics
for your followers?

22:32.251 --> 22:35.002
Uh, kind of. I'm taking down
the britney nashville ones

22:35.088 --> 22:37.254
and putting up
some unfiltered originals.

22:37.373 --> 22:38.706
I want to have
the real me out there.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.041
I'm proud of you, syd.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.625
I know that wasn't easy.

22:41.744 --> 22:42.960
Thanks.

22:43.079 --> 22:46.764
Oh, speaking of, how did it go
with the fake vacation photos?

22:46.883 --> 22:49.050
Did you get out of
cousin archie's birthday party?

22:49.102 --> 22:50.968
We'll see.
Grandma just posted them.

22:52.271 --> 22:54.305
Well, he totally bought it.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.256
Yes! No lame party.

22:56.359 --> 22:58.926
The only problem is
I just got an email from him

22:58.978 --> 23:01.028
saying our vacation
looked like so much fun,

23:01.114 --> 23:02.780
he wants to come
with us next year.

23:02.899 --> 23:05.599
No! What are we going to do?

23:05.651 --> 23:07.451
Didn't you learn
anything from me?

23:07.603 --> 23:09.153
Just be honest.

23:09.271 --> 23:11.155
Oh, he wants you to come too.

23:11.273 --> 23:13.157
So what are we thinking,
fake tornado?

23:14.160 --> 23:15.493
-Oh, yeah.
-Good one.

23:17.580 --> 23:18.662
<i> Oh, yeah.</i>

23:18.781 --> 23:20.080
(drumroll)
