of our family connections,

17:50.320 --> 17:52.891
you take my progress personally.

on showing up in numbers

running chalk and rafflers.

If I drop a glass on the floor,
you pick it up.

53:24.560 --> 53:26.289
I want to watch you pick it up.

53:30.400 --> 53:32.528
-(GLASS CRUNCHING)
- Right, you little slag.

53:32.680 --> 53:35.524
- I tried to be nice. Yeah?
-(GROANS)

53:35.600 --> 53:38.809
If I drop a glass on the floor,

53:39.240 --> 53:43.404
you bend over and fucking pick up
the fucking glass.

53:43.480 --> 53:45.721
- Okay? (SHOUTING) What?
- No, sir. No.

53:45.800 --> 53:47.325
KIMBER: What are you doing here?

53:47.400 --> 53:49.528
- I've got another hour.
- TOMMY: just wait.

53:49.600 --> 53:52.444
Listen to me. just listen to me.

53:52.880 --> 53:55.451
I was going to let you go through
with this but, in the end,

53:55.520 --> 53:59.525
my conscience got the better of me.
She looks good on the outside,

54:01.960 --> 54:03.769
but she has the clap.

54:06.200 --> 54:08.089
TOMMY: Yeah. Syphilis.

54:09.440 --> 54:11.090
When you took a shine to her,
I thought I'd use her.

54:11.280 --> 54:13.806
Someone told me she had the syph,
I thought, "What the hell?"

54:16.560 --> 54:18.562
Call it my better nature.

54:19.400 --> 54:21.050
She's, uh, she's a whore.

54:26.560 --> 54:29.484
- Well, just go and wait in the car.
- I can walk on my own.

54:34.560 --> 54:36.608
Can we shake hands
and forget this ever happened?

54:44.000 --> 54:45.764
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

54:48.000 --> 54:49.923
(GATE CREAKING)

55:01.680 --> 55:04.411
Start of the day,
I was Lady Sarah of Connemara.

55:05.960 --> 55:09.043
By the end, I was a whore with the clap.

55:11.160 --> 55:13.606
You're a fucking bastard,
offering me like that.

55:19.560 --> 55:21.608
But then you change your mind.

55:25.440 --> 55:27.363
Why did you change your mind, Thomas?

55:32.720 --> 55:34.722
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

55:49.520 --> 55:55.209
<i># Take a little walk to the edge of town
and go across the track</i>

55:57.160 --> 56:01.290
<i># Where the viaduct looms
like a bird of doom</i>

56:01.360 --> 56:05.365
<i># As it shifts and cracks... #</i>
