WEBVTT

02:06.627 --> 02:09.045
<i>And that is why we are here today,</i>

02:09.630 --> 02:13.884
to pray for our brother
whose body lies here in rest.

02:13.967 --> 02:17.679
He has passed from death to life
in the company of Lord Jesus,

02:18.472 --> 02:22.476
who died and rose to a new life…

02:24.144 --> 02:26.647
and is purified in all his faults.

02:27.689 --> 02:34.238
And we pray God welcome him
among all the saints of heaven. Amen.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.073
Amen.

03:46.852 --> 03:48.061
Get up, Larry.

03:50.147 --> 03:53.192
- Why can't Gary come?
- Yeah, why can't I come?

03:53.275 --> 03:55.277
'Cause Gary don't wet the bed.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.237
Get your ass out the door. Come on.

04:34.441 --> 04:35.442
Hey, pal.

04:36.068 --> 04:37.152
Hey, Dad.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.113
You still want to do this?

04:43.575 --> 04:44.785
You had to work.

04:45.702 --> 04:46.870
Just got off shift.

04:48.372 --> 04:49.581
Aren't you tired?

04:50.499 --> 04:51.500
I'm okay.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.336
All right, get up.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.185
There we go! Good adjustment, Jimmy.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.437
Alabama, hike!

05:13.897 --> 05:16.817
We got it. I want you to turn
a little bit quicker. Okay, Jim?

05:16.900 --> 05:18.861
Go long. Turn right, go!

05:20.904 --> 05:23.407
Touchdown, Jimmy Keene!

05:24.867 --> 05:26.702
Elephant, six, four. Hike.

05:27.202 --> 05:28.829
Set. Hike.

05:30.539 --> 05:31.957
Giraffe, six, four.

05:38.589 --> 05:40.424
- No.
- I got you.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.474
I'm partial to Corvettes.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.855
You know,
when you make it to the NFL.

05:57.733 --> 06:00.027
I was thinking more like a Gremlin,

06:00.110 --> 06:02.613
with the thing in the back
that lifts up?

06:03.614 --> 06:05.199
Called a hatchback.

06:05.282 --> 06:06.450
Yeah, one of those.

06:11.455 --> 06:12.456
A Gremlin.

06:13.957 --> 06:16.168
With a racing stripe, I promise.

06:17.836 --> 06:20.005
Gremlin. I'll Gremlin you.

10:10.819 --> 10:11.820
Hey, bud.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.156
Hey.

10:14.239 --> 10:15.240
Where were you?

10:17.075 --> 10:19.912
- You know…
- No, I don't.

10:19.995 --> 10:21.246
That's why I'm asking.

10:22.206 --> 10:23.498
Just came back from chow.

10:25.250 --> 10:29.546
So, your old man couldn't lay his hands
on any product. That right?

10:30.756 --> 10:31.840
Unfortunately, yeah.

10:34.384 --> 10:35.761
Didn't mean to block your door.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.890
- No, it's fine.
- No. Come on in.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.624
So you're saying there's no money left?

11:08.043 --> 11:09.044
He spent it.

11:10.754 --> 11:13.507
Fucking guy's the gift
that keeps on giving, huh?

11:17.094 --> 11:20.973
Guys on the outside want their money.
What am I gonna do, Jim?

11:22.850 --> 11:24.017
I tried, Mr. Carter.

11:28.105 --> 11:30.899
If you say that's what you did,
I gotta believe you.

11:33.443 --> 11:36.363
- Hope so.
- I just wish we'd known each other longer.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.533
Then I'd have a better sense
of your character.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.704
I did everything I could.

12:02.890 --> 12:05.809
<i>Riot quiet</i>

12:17.404 --> 12:18.572
What's that?

12:24.244 --> 12:28.540
When it's quiet like this,
they call it "riot quiet."

12:29.124 --> 12:32.002
Like the calm before a storm.

12:34.546 --> 12:35.797
Really?

12:35.881 --> 12:36.882
Yeah.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.386
Yeah, or it just means it's quiet.

12:42.221 --> 12:43.722
Did you see anyone in here?

12:49.186 --> 12:50.187
No.

12:52.481 --> 12:53.524
Something missing?

12:55.400 --> 12:56.985
Why would something be missing?

13:03.200 --> 13:05.702
Well, if I was worried
someone had been in my spot,

13:06.912 --> 13:08.580
I'd worry someone took something.

13:09.122 --> 13:13.585
I'm not worried someone was in my spot.

13:15.212 --> 13:16.213
No?

13:16.755 --> 13:17.923
Oh, no.

13:20.551 --> 13:22.845
Then why did you ask
if I saw someone in there?

15:08.867 --> 15:10.827
Why are you looking at me like that?

15:14.873 --> 15:16.416
I'm not looking at you any way.

15:17.251 --> 15:18.460
Like you know me.

15:20.379 --> 15:23.340
Larry, what the fuck?

15:23.882 --> 15:24.883
Is that a question?

15:24.967 --> 15:27.886
'Cause that's one thing you do.
You ask a lot of questions.

15:30.347 --> 15:31.557
Where's this coming from?

15:36.353 --> 15:37.688
That was a question.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.316
Okay, Larry.

15:41.817 --> 15:43.318
Okay, what?

15:43.986 --> 15:48.115
I'm gonna leave you to it.
Whatever this is.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.161
Wait, Jimmy.

16:11.889 --> 16:15.225
When there's doubt, there's no doubt.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.563
How's that?

16:19.646 --> 16:21.273
Something Gary says.

16:21.857 --> 16:24.401
He heard it from a friend
who liberated Kuwait.

16:26.528 --> 16:28.697
If you think you could be in danger…

16:31.617 --> 16:32.951
you are in danger.

16:39.124 --> 16:40.501
Something's gonna happen.

16:45.339 --> 16:46.423
What?

16:46.507 --> 16:49.259
I don't know, but something bad.
Don't you think?

17:06.151 --> 17:08.194
Sorry about earlier.

17:08.819 --> 17:09.820
I get…

17:11.198 --> 17:12.199
You get what?

17:16.161 --> 17:17.162
Paranoid.

17:18.372 --> 17:19.373
Or whatever.

17:21.165 --> 17:24.086
- You know?
- No, Larry. I don't.

17:26.839 --> 17:30.050
Jimmy, I know you're upset.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.635
I am not upset.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.431
I just-- I don't know you
from one minute to the next.

18:09.798 --> 18:11.258
Hold it open.

18:35.365 --> 18:36.450
Fuck you!

19:01.141 --> 19:03.602
<i>All inmates, return to your cells.</i>

19:03.685 --> 19:04.978
<i>We're on lockdown.</i>

19:10.984 --> 19:14.863
<i>Attention. Lockdown in progress.
Attention. Lockdown in progress.</i>

19:15.739 --> 19:19.326
<i>Inmates, go to your cells! Full lockdown.</i>

19:24.706 --> 19:26.792
89304, report to Central Command.

20:11.837 --> 20:12.921
Jimmy?

20:16.383 --> 20:17.634
Jimmy, you in there?

20:26.727 --> 20:27.895
What's up, Larry?

20:30.814 --> 20:33.775
Are you still mad at me?

20:39.990 --> 20:41.617
I was never mad at you, Larry.

20:44.453 --> 20:46.455
I think you were.

20:50.042 --> 20:52.336
Just 'cause you think it,
don't make it so.

20:57.549 --> 20:58.550
Yeah.

21:02.012 --> 21:05.224
Friends? Jimmy, friends?

21:07.768 --> 21:08.769
What?

21:10.812 --> 21:11.939
Friends again?

21:29.957 --> 21:30.958
Yeah.

21:34.169 --> 21:35.212
Sure, Larry.

21:37.923 --> 21:38.924
Friends.

21:49.268 --> 21:50.269
What?

21:54.565 --> 21:56.650
I take care of my friends.

22:26.763 --> 22:28.015
Mr. Holt?

22:28.098 --> 22:29.600
Convict Hall?

22:29.683 --> 22:32.144
Could we lay our hands on
a hose or two, Mr. Holt?

22:32.227 --> 22:34.313
That's a negative, Convict Hall.

22:35.856 --> 22:37.357
May I ask why?

22:37.441 --> 22:40.527
'Cause somebody could
fucking strangle someone with it, Convict.

22:42.279 --> 22:43.405
Work with what you got.

22:46.909 --> 22:49.953
Okay.
We're gonna stack the large debris first.

22:50.037 --> 22:53.582
Anywhere you see or feel
cooking oil on the floor,

22:53.665 --> 22:57.669
I want you to hit it with some Comet,
but don't clean it up yet.

22:57.753 --> 23:00.130
We're gonna stack all the debris
in the east corner there.

23:00.214 --> 23:01.215
Donny.

23:04.134 --> 23:05.135
Donny?

23:06.637 --> 23:10.265
Hi. I need you to sweep up the glass,

23:10.349 --> 23:13.310
so that we can work the debris
without cutting ourselves.

23:14.686 --> 23:15.854
I trust you with that?

23:15.938 --> 23:17.272
Yes, Larry.

23:17.856 --> 23:19.024
Have at it, son.

23:19.525 --> 23:22.945
Well. Let's get to it, men.

23:25.197 --> 23:26.365
Grab some gloves.

23:33.038 --> 23:36.500
Hey, guys. Don't forget about
the front up here, okay?

23:37.501 --> 23:40.254
Don't worry about all the food.
We're gonna sweep that up.

23:40.337 --> 23:41.755
Just grab the big items.

23:43.215 --> 23:45.259
Jimmy, it's actually kind of fun, right?

23:45.342 --> 23:47.469
Can I have you on this end with him?

23:47.553 --> 23:49.054
All right, one, two, three.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.807
It's very slippery.
There's a lot of blood. Be careful.

23:51.890 --> 23:55.894
Guys, we-- Gentlemen, we still have
all the cups down here.

23:56.520 --> 23:59.565
Let's grab all of those cups.
How's it look down there?

23:59.648 --> 24:00.649
It's okay.

24:01.525 --> 24:06.321
Guys, we're going to sweep first,
and then we're going to mop.

24:06.989 --> 24:08.615
But we need spray bottles.

24:11.410 --> 24:13.036
We need putty knives.

24:13.120 --> 24:14.830
They ain't giving us putty knives.

24:17.457 --> 24:21.587
We'll find the really hard spots,
spray 'em and leave 'em for an hour.

24:22.087 --> 24:23.964
They might come up on a sponge then.

24:25.257 --> 24:28.760
After that, we'll get the oil up.

24:32.639 --> 24:33.932
How'd you get into this?

24:36.185 --> 24:37.186
Cleaning?

24:39.771 --> 24:40.772
High school.

24:42.983 --> 24:46.361
After school I would go work a job
at a feedstore in town.

24:47.487 --> 24:50.741
And then I moved to a place
that specialized in medical supplies.

24:51.783 --> 24:52.784
What'd you do?

24:54.536 --> 24:55.579
In high school?

24:55.662 --> 24:57.289
To support yourself, yeah.

24:59.041 --> 25:00.292
Sold weed.

25:02.920 --> 25:05.547
I'm not sure we had weed
in my high school.

25:05.631 --> 25:09.176
Larry, if you were in America,
you had weed.

25:09.760 --> 25:14.223
Well, Wabash was just so innocent, though.
It's like where Opie lived.

25:16.433 --> 25:17.434
Mayberry.

25:18.977 --> 25:20.687
Yeah, or, like, where Opie lived.

25:23.815 --> 25:25.359
We didn't have any crime.

25:26.527 --> 25:28.779
We were, like, stuck in a time warp,
you know?

25:32.032 --> 25:35.494
Malt shops and pigtails.

25:40.457 --> 25:42.084
It was Tanner's Grocer.

25:43.335 --> 25:45.254
Everybody wore white hats.

25:45.337 --> 25:47.673
And all the appliances
and all the food chests,

25:47.756 --> 25:48.966
they just gleamed.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.637
and Main Street, my word.

25:53.720 --> 25:57.307
Just blocks of department stores
and candy stores.

25:57.391 --> 25:58.892
Remember candy stores?

26:01.436 --> 26:04.982
And nice people sweeping the sidewalks,

26:05.065 --> 26:08.235
everybody waving hello.

26:11.071 --> 26:13.490
Our high school had the greenest lawns.

26:15.117 --> 26:18.704
I never saw green like that before,
or since.

26:21.331 --> 26:25.752
And the prettiest cheerleaders
the world's ever seen.

26:30.549 --> 26:32.467
What a world it was, James.

26:35.012 --> 26:37.055
Even living in a cemetery.

26:45.105 --> 26:46.565
You grew up in a cemetery?

26:47.816 --> 26:50.277
Oh, yeah. Sure did.

26:50.903 --> 26:54.198
You'd be surprised how much fun
you can have in a place like that

26:55.699 --> 27:00.662
when you stop seeing the headstones
and just see fields and trees.

27:03.207 --> 27:04.708
Never thought of it that way.

27:06.877 --> 27:09.171
It was actually
a pretty nice way to grow up.

27:50.963 --> 27:55.843
Happiness is a choice.
Don't you think, James?

28:13.777 --> 28:14.778
Sometimes.

28:14.862 --> 28:16.196
I say happiness is a choice

28:16.280 --> 28:19.157
because I don't think
my parents were happy.

28:20.367 --> 28:22.369
They let that grind them down.

28:24.538 --> 28:26.415
That was hard to watch sometimes.

28:32.796 --> 28:33.922
How about you?

28:39.094 --> 28:42.472
I was lucky. I had a great dad.

28:43.390 --> 28:48.729
I never had, like, a best friend
because I always had my old man.

30:16.275 --> 30:17.776
'Cause you're out all night.

30:18.694 --> 30:22.114
- You're never fucking here.
- Because I fucking work.

30:22.197 --> 30:24.283
- What do you think I do?
- I don't know.

30:24.366 --> 30:26.994
What do you do, Lynne?
What do you fucking do?

30:27.077 --> 30:28.912
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

30:30.998 --> 30:33.584
You cock that fist,
you better use it, big man.

30:33.667 --> 30:37.588
Tough man.
Big, tough cop can't even get it up.

30:39.256 --> 30:40.591
That's right!

30:42.050 --> 30:44.761
Break things like a fucking child.

30:45.971 --> 30:47.389
Fuck you, Lynne!

30:51.560 --> 30:52.561
Dad?

31:14.875 --> 31:19.505
All that time your old man spent with you,
did that help?

31:22.883 --> 31:25.344
Were you a good football player?

31:27.471 --> 31:30.641
Best my high school had seen in 15 years.

31:30.724 --> 31:33.810
And that guy got a scholarship to USC.

31:37.231 --> 31:40.317
Sometimes you remind me
so much of Gary, my gums ache.

31:42.819 --> 31:44.905
You both talk so big.

32:03.215 --> 32:04.216
I lied.

32:06.218 --> 32:07.219
You what?

32:07.302 --> 32:08.846
I was second string.

32:09.429 --> 32:12.933
I rode the bench, all four years.

32:16.061 --> 32:17.604
But you still made the team.

32:17.688 --> 32:19.189
A lot of people made the team.

32:20.023 --> 32:23.277
No, James, you made the team.
That's an accomplishment.

32:25.362 --> 32:26.864
Why did you lie about it?

32:28.282 --> 32:29.449
You know how it is.

32:29.533 --> 32:30.784
I do not.

32:31.285 --> 32:32.452
Come on.

32:32.536 --> 32:34.872
Dudes try to impress other dudes

32:34.955 --> 32:38.834
with stories that make them look bigger
than they are.

32:39.918 --> 32:40.919
Why?

32:43.297 --> 32:45.048
So they'll like 'em? I don't know.

33:00.480 --> 33:02.858
If you had a pet chicken,
could you eat it?

33:06.486 --> 33:07.696
Who has a pet chicken?

33:08.197 --> 33:11.116
I don't know. I'd suspect some folks do.

33:11.200 --> 33:12.910
And I suspect no folks do.

33:12.993 --> 33:14.244
But if you did?

33:14.828 --> 33:15.954
I wouldn't.

33:18.290 --> 33:21.752
Well, I would. I would have one
and I would eat it.

33:25.339 --> 33:26.673
You'd eat your pet?

33:28.300 --> 33:29.801
Yeah, it's just meat.

33:29.885 --> 33:33.597
We're all just… meat.

33:35.724 --> 33:37.226
I would eat my pet dog.

33:47.194 --> 33:48.195
Have you?

33:48.695 --> 33:49.696
What?

33:50.280 --> 33:51.615
Eaten your dog?

33:52.699 --> 33:55.327
Well, we weren't allowed
to have pets growing up.

33:56.662 --> 33:58.121
That's probably a good thing.

33:58.830 --> 34:02.042
But what is the difference
between a pet and a meal?

34:04.044 --> 34:06.922
People don't have
pet chickens or pet cows.

34:07.005 --> 34:08.257
They have pet fish.

34:09.341 --> 34:11.051
How is a puppy different?

34:12.928 --> 34:14.304
Nobody plates a puppy.

34:19.601 --> 34:21.687
"No one plates a puppy."

34:23.355 --> 34:25.899
Hey, convicts. This isn't a date.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.777
Do your job and stop fucking goofing off.

34:34.491 --> 34:35.826
Hey.

34:39.329 --> 34:41.248
We weren't allowed to have pets growing up

34:41.331 --> 34:46.503
because my dad said that
it got in the way of real work.

34:50.924 --> 34:53.760
We were put on God's green
to do real work.

35:04.313 --> 35:05.772
Get to it then.

35:08.942 --> 35:10.110
Did I stutter?

36:01.161 --> 36:02.704
Hurry up about it.

36:23.767 --> 36:25.310
Wait, how old were you again?

36:28.522 --> 36:32.609
I was 14 when I started
digging graves, like, officially.

36:32.693 --> 36:34.403
But I'd dug plenty up before then.

36:36.071 --> 36:37.447
What's the difference?

36:38.991 --> 36:42.202
Well, you dig a grave.
You dig up a coffin.

36:46.415 --> 36:47.583
Why?

36:49.084 --> 36:50.169
Why dig up…

36:50.252 --> 36:54.756
Well, people bury the dead
with all sorts of things they can't use.

36:55.340 --> 36:58.844
Watches, shoes, money.

37:00.012 --> 37:01.471
I remember one old gal,

37:01.555 --> 37:05.684
she got buried
with a solid gold Siamese cat,

37:05.767 --> 37:07.269
like a doorstop, you know?

37:08.061 --> 37:10.731
She's dead,
what does she need a doorstop for?

37:11.315 --> 37:12.983
Or a cat, or gold?

37:14.151 --> 37:17.446
Some people are just so sick
that they would take something

37:17.529 --> 37:19.615
that could do good in the world
for someone,

37:19.698 --> 37:22.117
and they just hoard it all to themselves

37:22.201 --> 37:24.536
in a casket six feet under the ground,

37:24.620 --> 37:27.164
where it won't help nobody, James.

37:27.247 --> 37:29.166
It ain't serving any kind of benefit.

37:33.003 --> 37:34.588
You weren't scared, though?

37:35.923 --> 37:37.925
Down in a dark hole with a--

37:39.760 --> 37:41.220
You know, a corpse?

37:43.388 --> 37:45.015
The dead are pleasant.

37:46.099 --> 37:48.894
They don't talk down to you,
don't talk back.

37:49.686 --> 37:51.605
They're just so peaceful.

37:53.524 --> 37:57.110
I look into their faces,
and it gives me hope that the next world--

37:58.570 --> 38:00.697
That the next world is gonna be
the good one.

38:09.164 --> 38:11.124
I'll tell you something else, James.

38:12.125 --> 38:15.963
No matter who a person was in real life,
death evens it all out.

38:18.048 --> 38:19.800
I knew a girl named Debra Kyle.

38:19.883 --> 38:24.596
She was the-- She was untouchable.

38:25.180 --> 38:27.558
Kindergarten through senior year.
She went off to college.

38:27.641 --> 38:31.186
We all thought, "She's gonna
rule the world, that one."

38:34.606 --> 38:37.901
Then she went to college
and learned about roof jumping.

38:38.485 --> 38:41.530
She didn't learn good,
and she fell between two buildings.

38:43.115 --> 38:44.658
She broke her fucking neck.

38:50.497 --> 38:53.125
She got a lot less untouchable after that.

38:55.961 --> 38:57.087
Like I said,

38:58.422 --> 38:59.715
evens it out.

39:22.237 --> 39:23.405
Evens what out?

39:26.033 --> 39:28.035
Whatever they thought they were in life.

39:37.753 --> 39:39.004
Get to it. Come on.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.668
Is your father still alive?

41:01.670 --> 41:03.213
Yeah. Yours?

41:05.591 --> 41:07.009
What does he do for work?

41:09.219 --> 41:10.345
Fireman.

41:13.974 --> 41:15.434
Did your mommy work?

41:19.563 --> 41:20.564
My mother…

41:23.025 --> 41:25.027
she owned her own bar.

41:30.324 --> 41:32.034
She loved everything about it.

41:34.411 --> 41:35.996
It's a weird lifestyle.

41:36.705 --> 41:39.791
She'd be going to work when
most kids' moms were making them dinner.

41:39.875 --> 41:41.793
Come home, like,
2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.

41:41.877 --> 41:44.796
Not what my old man
thought he was signing up for

41:44.880 --> 41:47.424
when he married an Italian girl
from the neighborhood.

41:51.470 --> 41:52.638
They fought a lot.

41:54.431 --> 41:56.517
'Cause she was fucking guys at the bar?

41:58.644 --> 41:59.895
I fucking beg your pardon?

42:11.240 --> 42:15.702
He thought she was, maybe.

42:15.786 --> 42:20.040
Either way, he didn't like her flirting,
and she loved to flirt. So…

42:20.123 --> 42:22.042
How did you feel about her flirting?

42:59.705 --> 43:03.834
We'll just say Lynne's a piece of work
and leave it at that.

43:08.463 --> 43:09.923
My mom's fat.

43:13.427 --> 43:14.845
We'll leave it at that.

43:28.275 --> 43:30.277
Tell me something true, James.

43:32.321 --> 43:33.614
"Something true"?

43:34.114 --> 43:35.157
About you.

43:36.700 --> 43:39.286
- I've been telling you the truth all day.
- Have you?

43:45.751 --> 43:46.752
Okay.

43:55.052 --> 43:58.055
So my parents broke up when I was a kid.

43:59.264 --> 44:04.311
Then my mother,
six months later, she let him move in.

44:05.062 --> 44:06.313
"Him"?

44:06.396 --> 44:07.397
Glen.

44:09.608 --> 44:12.986
Real scumbag.

44:14.488 --> 44:18.075
Anyway, they'd been together around a year
when he started hitting her.

44:20.786 --> 44:22.162
Would he hit you?

44:22.246 --> 44:23.247
All the time.

44:24.581 --> 44:29.461
Me and my brother, but… mostly me.

44:30.420 --> 44:33.507
Anyway, she would not leave him.

44:34.675 --> 44:35.968
I couldn't figure it out.

44:38.095 --> 44:42.224
And then I got it.

44:42.808 --> 44:49.481
She was waiting for me to get old enough
and strong enough to protect her.

44:52.776 --> 44:54.653
That wasn't fair to put that on you.

44:54.736 --> 44:55.737
I don't mind.

44:55.821 --> 45:00.284
Anyway, I started taking my Tae Kwon Do
and karate and jujitsu classes

45:00.367 --> 45:01.910
way more seriously than I ever had.

45:01.994 --> 45:04.413
Changed my diet, changed everything.

45:04.496 --> 45:06.707
And pretty soon,
I could beat any kid's ass.

45:07.875 --> 45:10.127
But, you know, I still needed to age,

45:11.336 --> 45:14.089
to grow until I could take on
a full-grown man.

45:14.673 --> 45:17.801
And Glen, big fucking guy.

45:17.885 --> 45:19.928
But by the time I was 14…

45:21.597 --> 45:22.764
I was ready.

45:24.683 --> 45:28.478
So, one night, we're all in the kitchen,

45:30.314 --> 45:31.648
and Glen hits my mother.

45:33.817 --> 45:36.653
Just a little flick of his fingers
back into her mouth.

45:38.822 --> 45:40.073
And I bring it.

45:40.157 --> 45:43.869
- You kicked his ass.
- No, Larry.

45:47.664 --> 45:50.000
Glen paints the fucking kitchen with me.

45:50.584 --> 45:55.130
He bloodied my nose, gave me what
I'm pretty sure was my first concussion,

45:55.214 --> 45:58.300
and fractured three of my ribs.

45:59.760 --> 46:01.762
He sends me to my room that way.

46:02.346 --> 46:03.680
And where was she?

46:13.482 --> 46:14.900
She was taking a shower.

46:20.989 --> 46:22.741
Do you know why she took a shower, Larry?

46:25.077 --> 46:28.205
'Cause she wanted to smell good
when she was fucking him.

46:29.706 --> 46:31.083
That's what she did…

46:32.876 --> 46:34.795
with me on the other side of the wall.

46:37.339 --> 46:42.344
They're giggling in there,
gasping and moaning,

46:42.928 --> 46:44.680
with the ice cubes
rattling in their glasses.

46:44.763 --> 46:46.098
And I gotta sit there…

46:49.142 --> 46:54.773
with a bloody nose and my head ringing
and my fucking ribs barking--

46:54.857 --> 46:57.442
That wasn't what hurt!

46:57.526 --> 46:59.695
All right. Wrap it up, bitches.

47:04.074 --> 47:05.492
That wasn't…

47:05.576 --> 47:07.160
It actually hurt like hell, Larry.

47:07.244 --> 47:10.330
No, bones heal.

47:10.414 --> 47:11.790
Concussions end.

47:11.874 --> 47:14.168
James, no.

47:14.251 --> 47:15.627
What hurt was that…

47:17.754 --> 47:21.675
What hurt was that she loved him
so much more than she loved you.

47:33.896 --> 47:35.397
There's something else.

47:37.274 --> 47:40.736
No. No, there isn't.

47:43.071 --> 47:44.740
I want to live with Dad.

47:44.823 --> 47:46.241
Well, you can't.

47:47.409 --> 47:51.622
Jim… what do you want me to say here?

47:56.835 --> 48:01.006
Someday, you'll be old enough to stand up
to Glen, but today ain't that day.

48:04.009 --> 48:05.427
Now I'm sorry that you got tuned up,

48:05.511 --> 48:08.263
but you put the quarter in the jukebox.
You gotta dance.

48:08.347 --> 48:09.640
I was protecting you.

48:10.224 --> 48:11.683
This wasn't about me.

48:12.184 --> 48:13.727
This was about you.

48:14.394 --> 48:16.104
And you got what you were asking for,

48:16.188 --> 48:18.815
but it didn't turn out the way
that you wanted it to.

48:22.528 --> 48:24.112
Well, there'll be other chances.

48:24.196 --> 48:26.323
Just learn to walk before you try and run.

48:27.449 --> 48:29.368
- Do you want some ice or anything?
- No.

48:29.451 --> 48:31.495
- I'll go get it for you. No problem.
- I'm fine.

48:36.083 --> 48:37.125
Suit yourself, hon.

48:38.001 --> 48:41.171
But you'll feel a lot better in the
morning if you put some ice on your face.

48:45.759 --> 48:46.969
Good night.

48:48.637 --> 48:49.972
Night.

48:59.523 --> 49:01.108
<i>You ever want to hurt her?</i>

49:01.608 --> 49:02.609
<i>My mother?</i>

49:03.485 --> 49:04.778
<i>Yes.</i>

49:05.612 --> 49:06.989
Yeah, I wanted to hurt her.

49:10.200 --> 49:11.201
Beat her?

49:16.748 --> 49:17.749
Kill her?

49:20.294 --> 49:22.546
Yeah,
I wanted to fucking kill her sometimes.

49:27.176 --> 49:28.886
Did you think about how?

49:35.058 --> 49:36.476
Chuck her down the stairs.

49:38.270 --> 49:41.231
Although, what if she hung on
for a few minutes after?

49:41.315 --> 49:42.316
They do that.

49:43.275 --> 49:46.403
Particularly with neck breaks.

49:51.200 --> 49:53.368
All right, convicts. Feet on the line.

49:58.290 --> 49:59.708
Could you do things to her then?

50:05.714 --> 50:06.715
What things?

50:12.137 --> 50:13.388
Things.

50:15.891 --> 50:17.059
To my mother?

50:20.562 --> 50:21.939
Well, to anyone.

50:27.861 --> 50:29.154
I don't understand.

50:37.746 --> 50:42.751
I soak a rag in starter fluid
and put it in a Mason jar in my van.

50:48.674 --> 50:51.760
If you put it over a person's face…

50:56.515 --> 50:58.976
they're out in seconds.

51:00.435 --> 51:01.770
Nothing to it.

51:11.655 --> 51:15.784
I gotta figure it's a lot more pleasant
than being thrown down a flight of stairs.

51:21.790 --> 51:22.958
Forget stairs.

51:25.878 --> 51:27.337
Why would you do that, Larry?

51:31.675 --> 51:33.218
So they'll stop hitting me.

51:39.099 --> 51:40.100
"They"?

51:44.396 --> 51:45.814
Girls, you know.

51:49.484 --> 51:50.485
What girls?

51:52.487 --> 51:53.822
Girls I meet.

52:06.376 --> 52:08.587
What do you do with girls you meet?

52:22.559 --> 52:26.480
I like you almost as much as you like you.

52:28.899 --> 52:29.900
That's good.

52:57.135 --> 52:58.387
Cheers.

53:17.364 --> 53:18.949
Yeah.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.168
So, what's next?

53:48.645 --> 53:49.897
Jimmy.

53:53.942 --> 53:54.943
Yeah?

53:56.278 --> 53:57.821
Today was real fun.

54:01.074 --> 54:02.201
Yeah, it was.

54:07.706 --> 54:08.749
Good night.

54:11.293 --> 54:12.461
Good night, Larry.

55:01.844 --> 55:03.387
What's that?

55:04.179 --> 55:05.848
Birds. They're watching.

55:07.266 --> 55:08.475
Owls?

55:08.559 --> 55:11.728
Falcons. They watch over the dead.

55:12.729 --> 55:14.022
Falcons do that?

55:14.106 --> 55:16.984
Some do. Now, get back to work now.

55:26.785 --> 55:27.911
Fuck you doing, boy?

55:31.790 --> 55:32.916
Come on.

55:34.126 --> 55:35.127
Got it.

55:52.269 --> 55:53.604
Mine now.

55:59.902 --> 56:01.653
<i>How long did it last?</i>

56:01.737 --> 56:02.988
A few hours.

56:03.906 --> 56:04.990
Were you scared?

56:05.073 --> 56:08.702
For sure, yeah. It's, like, barbaric.

56:09.203 --> 56:11.580
Riots are barbaric.

56:16.710 --> 56:19.171
Well, you look good.
You put on some weight.

56:20.005 --> 56:21.340
Do I look fat?

56:21.423 --> 56:23.091
No, you needed to gain a few.

56:24.343 --> 56:25.761
You look good, I said.

56:26.303 --> 56:27.804
Girls don't like fat guys.

56:29.056 --> 56:31.225
Are you runnin' into a lot of girls
in here?

56:32.726 --> 56:34.144
I mean, once I'm out.

56:39.399 --> 56:42.986
Hey, Gar, what was the name of that girl
we picked up?

56:44.321 --> 56:45.781
To California? That one?

56:46.281 --> 56:47.407
On the road trip.

56:47.908 --> 56:49.993
I don't remember her name.
That was a long time ago.

56:50.077 --> 56:51.620
No, it was--

56:52.996 --> 56:54.623
I think it was Lois.

56:56.708 --> 56:57.709
Wasn't Lois.

56:59.545 --> 57:01.755
Or Louise.

57:01.839 --> 57:03.090
It wasn't fucking Louise.

57:06.927 --> 57:08.136
Donna.

57:08.637 --> 57:11.807
It wasn't Lois or Louise or Donna.
We never knew her name.

57:11.890 --> 57:13.559
We didn't? I'm sure we did.

57:13.642 --> 57:15.602
Larry, she was some chick
that we picked up.

57:15.686 --> 57:18.730
The next morning, she headed out with
that biker who had that puke-green Harley.

57:18.814 --> 57:20.065
That was the last we saw of her.

57:21.275 --> 57:22.860
Now I remember.

57:25.028 --> 57:26.238
Wanda?

57:31.618 --> 57:33.203
Police dropped by the house.

57:34.580 --> 57:36.915
- The-- When?
- Couple days back.

57:38.625 --> 57:40.836
- Which ones?
- Local. Wabash.

57:43.797 --> 57:45.174
What'd they want?

57:45.257 --> 57:46.341
They didn't say.

57:46.842 --> 57:50.888
They just sort of talked around things.

57:51.889 --> 57:54.725
But they wanted to make it clear
they didn't forget you, Larry.

57:55.225 --> 57:56.393
That's the point here.

57:57.144 --> 57:59.521
They got you in their sights,
and they ain't planning to stop.

58:00.522 --> 58:02.816
- Why?
- You embarrassed them.

58:17.497 --> 58:18.498
Sharon.

58:23.754 --> 58:26.632
Yeah. That was it.

58:28.383 --> 58:30.010
You know what, Gary? You know something?

58:30.093 --> 58:33.222
If they're coming around now
trying to make me feel like

58:33.305 --> 58:36.308
they're gonna be all over me
when I get out,

58:36.391 --> 58:37.809
I mean, that's…

58:38.477 --> 58:40.437
It means they think you're gonna get out.

58:41.230 --> 58:42.231
Yeah.
