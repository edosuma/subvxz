00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
THE SHOW, STILL TAKING PLACE,

00:34.000 --> 00:34.000
BUT FOR THE LAST TIME, IN THIS

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
BLANK VOID.

00:37.000 --> 00:37.000
>> GOD, THAT FEELS GREAT TO

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
HEAR.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
THIS MUST BE HOW ENGLAND FELT

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
WHEN THEY GOT RID OF YOU.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
DIDN'T GET RID OF ME, I CHOSE TO

OKAY, SURE, LET'S GO WITH THAT.

00:51.000 --> 00:51.000
BACK?

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
LIKE, ANYONE?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
>> John: THAT'S A FAIR POINT.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
A BOMB THREAT IN WASHINGTON,

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
DEMOTED FROM HOST IN JEOPARDY TO

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
RUNNING IT, AND THEN THE LATEST

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
INNOVATION.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
>> WORK ROOMS IS USED ON

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
FACEBOOK'S OCULUS QUEST 2

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
STUPIDEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN.

01:20.000 --> 01:20.000
DO YOU LIKE ZOOM MEETINGS?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
NO?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
WELL, THIS IS LIKE THAT, EXCEPT

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
YOU GET TO WEAR A HELMET AND

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
YOUR COWORKERS ARE GLITCHY SIMS.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
IT'S ANOTHER GAME-CHANGING HIT

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
FROM THE GUY WHO BROUGHT YOU

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
"EVERYONE YOU WENT TO

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
HIGH SCHOOL WITH IS Q-ANON NOW."

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
BUT INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THAT,

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
LET'S DIVE STRAIGHT IN WITH OUR

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
MAIN STORY TONIGHT: AFGHANISTAN.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
AMERICA'S WAR THERE IS DRAWING

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
TO A CLOSE AFTER ALMOST 20 YEARS

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
OF FIGHTING.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
WE ALL KNEW THE END WAS LIKELY

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
TO BE UGLY.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
THE ONLY QUESTION WAS

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
"HOW UGLY?"

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
WELL, THIS WEEK, WE GOT OUR

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
ANSWER.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
>> AFGHANS ARE THRONGING TO

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
KABUL'S AIRPORT.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
>> THIS IS WHAT DESPERATION

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
LOOKS LIKE.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
>> WE NOW KNOW THAT AT LEAST ONE

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
OF THE AMERICAN TRANSPORTS TOOK

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
OFF WITH A PAYLOAD FAR IN EXCESS

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
OF THE MAXIMUM RECOMMENDED.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
>> 800 PEOPLE ON YOUR JET?

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
HOLY COW.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
I MEAN, GOOD JOB GETTING OFF THE

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
GROUND.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
THAT IS TERRIFYING.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
YOU NEVER, EVER WANT TO BE ON A

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
PLANE THAT IS MANAGING TO

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
ACTIVELY IMPRESS AIR TRAFFIC

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
CONTROL.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, THAT IS THE

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
EXACT REACTION I WANT EVERY TIME

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
I DO A SINGLE PUSH-UP.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
"HOLY COW.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
I MEAN, GOOD JOB GETTING OFF THE

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
GROUND.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
NO ONE COULD'VE EXPECTED

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
ANYTHING MORE FROM YOU."

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
AND THE THING IS, THAT IS JUST

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
THE PEOPLE THAT MANAGED TO GET

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
ONTO THE PLANE.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
THERE WERE HORRIFIC VIDEOS THAT

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
WE ARE NOT GOING TO SHOW YOU OF

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
PEOPLE CLINGING TO THE WHEELS OF

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
A PLANE AND FALLING TO THEIR

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
DEATH AS THEY TOOK OFF.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
AND WHILE BIDEN INSISTED THAT

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
"WE PLANNED FOR EVERY

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
CONTINGENCY," THAT IS PRETTY

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
HARD TO BELIEVE GIVEN, JUST TEN

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
DAYS AGO, THE U.S. WAS

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
DESPERATELY TRYING TO NEGOTIATE

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
WITH THE TALIBAN, ASKING IT TO

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
SPARE OUR EMBASSY IN KABUL.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
A DAY LATER, THAT EMBASSY WAS

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
TOLD TO DESTROY SENSITIVE FILES,

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
AND BY THIS TIME LAST WEEK, WE

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
WERE EVACUATING IT ALTOGETHER.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
ALTHOUGH THE SECRETARY OF STATE

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
PUSHED BACK ON THE IDEA THAT THE

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
EMBASSY WAS CLOSED AT ALL.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
>> SO, IF NO AMERICAN IS IN THE

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
EMBASSY, WE'VE ESSENTIALLY

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
CLOSED THE EMBASSY.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU DON'T WANNA

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
SAY THAT.

03:02.000 --> 03:02.000
YEAH.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
>> NO, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A --

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A -- WE'RE

03:04.000 --> 03:04.000
GONNA HAVE OUR CORE DIPLOMATIC

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
PRESENCE.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
>> WE WILL?

03:06.000 --> 03:06.000
>> AND -- AND, IN EFFECT, AN

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
EMBASSY AT A LOCATION AT THE

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
AIRPORT.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
>> John: WOW, THAT IS A ROUGH

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
SENTENCE.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
BECAUSE "WE'LL HAVE, IN EFFECT,

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
AN EMBASSY" IS ALREADY PRETTY

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
ALARMING, THEN YOU FINISH IT OFF

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
WITH "AT A LOCATION AT THE

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
AIRPORT," PERHAPS THE DARKEST

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
QUALIFIER IN THE ENGLISH

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
LANGUAGE.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
BECAUSE, TO STATE THE OBVIOUS

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
HERE, AN EMBASSY DOES NOT BELONG

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
IN AN AIRPORT, BECAUSE IT'S NOT

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
A FUCKING WOLFGANG PUCK

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
RESTAURANT.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
AND THE FACT IS, AMERICA HAS NOW

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
JOINED A LONG LINE OF COUNTRIES

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
WHO CAME TO AFGHANISTAN TO SERVE

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
THEIR OWN INTERESTS ONLY TO

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
LEAVE DEFEATED.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
IT'S A PATTERN SO UNIVERSALLY

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
KNOWN IT WAS LITERALLY A PLOT

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
POINT IN "RAMBO III."

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
>> THIS IS AFGHANISTAN.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
ALEXANDER THE GREAT TRIED TO

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
CONQUER THIS COUNTRY.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
THEN GENGHIS KHAN, THEN THE

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
BRITISH, NOW RUSSIA.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
ANCIENT ENEMY MAKE PRAYER ABOUT

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
THESE PEOPLE.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
IT SAYS "MAY GOD DELIVER US FROM

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
THE VENOM OF THE COBRA, THE

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
TEETH OF THE TIGER, AND THE

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
VENGEANCE OF THE AFGHANS."

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS MEANS?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
>> THAT YOU GUYS DON'T TAKE ANY

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
SHIT?

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
>> YES.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
>> John: YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
IT, ALTHOUGH IT FEELS LIKE

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
OL' RAMBO COULD HAVE USED A FEW

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
MORE FOLLOW-UPS THERE.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
"YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS MEANS,

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
RIGHT?"

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
"YEAH, YOU GUYS DON'T TAKE ANY

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
SHIT."

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
"SURE, BUT ALSO THAT OUR

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS LONG BEEN

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
DEFINED BY OTHER COUNTRIES'

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
IMPERIAL SELF-INTEREST.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS?"

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
"NO.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
NO, I DON'T."

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
"YEAH, I DIDN'T THINK SO.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:38.000 --> 04:38.000
I'M GUESSING WE'LL BE SEEING YOU

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
GUYS IN ROUGHLY 15 YEARS."

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
AND LOOK, CLEARLY, WE DON'T HAVE

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
TIME TO RECAP THE LAST 20 YEARS

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
OF AMERICA'S INVOLVEMENT IN

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
AFGHANISTAN, MUCH LESS RECKON

04:51.000 --> 04:51.000
WITH ALL THE LONG-TERM

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
CONSEQUENCES.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
BUT WE THOUGHT TONIGHT, IN THE

04:53.000 --> 04:53.000
WAKE OF THE CHAOS THIS WEEK,

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
IT'D BE WORTH TRYING TO ANSWER A

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
FEW BASIC QUESTIONS: WHY WERE WE

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
IN AFGHANISTAN IN THE FIRST

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
PLACE, WHAT DID WE DO WHILE WE

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
WERE THERE, AND WHAT ARE WE

05:01.000 --> 05:01.000
DOING RIGHT NOW?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
AND LET'S START WITH WHY WE WERE

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
THERE.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
BECAUSE ON MONDAY, BIDEN OFFERED

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
THIS ORIGIN STORY:

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
>> WE WENT TO AFGHANISTAN ALMOST

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
20 YEARS AGO WITH CLEAR GOALS:

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
GET THOSE WHO ATTACKED US ON

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, AND MAKE

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
SURE AL-QAEDA COULD NOT USE

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
AFGHANISTAN AS A BASE FROM WHICH

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
TO ATTACK US AGAIN.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
OUR MISSION IN AFGHANISTAN WAS

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
NEVER SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
NATION-BUILDING.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
>> John: OH, OKAY THEN.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
IF OUR MISSION WAS NEVER

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
NATION-BUILDING, THEN I GUESS

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
NOT-MISSION NOT-ACCOMPLISHED.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
BUT THE THING IS, THAT'S A

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
LITTLE TRUE BUT ALSO A LOT NOT.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
BECAUSE, YES, THE PRIMARY REASON

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
FOR INITIALLY INVADING

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
AFGHANISTAN WAS 9/11 AND THE

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
FACT THAT THE TALIBAN HAD BEEN

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
GIVING SAFE HAVEN TO BIN LADEN.

05:42.000 --> 05:42.000
BUT VERY QUICKLY, THAT MISSION

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
BECAME DRESSED UP IN THE

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
LANGUAGE OF NATION-BUILDING AND

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
HUMAN RIGHTS.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
GEORGE W. BUSH SAID, "ROOTING

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
OUT THE TALIBAN WAS IMPORTANT,

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
BUT BUILDING A SCHOOL IS EQUALLY

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
IMPORTANT," AND BIDEN HIMSELF

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
SAID BACK THEN, "THE ALTERNATIVE

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
TO NATION-BUILDING IS CHAOS."

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
AND THERE WAS LOTS OF FOCUS AT

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
THE TIME ON ATROCITIES THE

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
TALIBAN HAD COMMITTED DURING

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
THEIR FIVE YEARS OF REPRESSIVE

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
RULE -- THE SUBJUGATION OF

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
WOMEN, THE EXECUTIONS IN A

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
SOCCER STADIUM, THE DESTRUCTION

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
OF THE FAMOUS BUDDHAS OF

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
BAMIYAN, ALL OF WHICH WERE

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
TERRIBLE, BUT WHICH HAD BEEN

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
EQUALLY TERRIBLE BEFORE

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
SEPTEMBER 11TH, AND WE HADN'T

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
DONE MUCH ABOUT IT.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
THE TRUTH IS, BETWEEN A

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
POST-9/11 DESIRE FOR VENGEANCE

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
AND THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
FRAMING INTERVENTION AS A

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
"CRUSADE" FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, THEY

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
BUILT A NEAR-UNIVERSAL POLITICAL

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
CONSENSUS.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
ONLY ONE MEMBER OF CONGRESS,

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
REPRESENTATIVE BARBARA LEE,

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
VOTED AGAINST THE AUTHORIZATION

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
OF MILITARY FORCE.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
OTHER DEMOCRATS JUMPED TO

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
CO-SIGN THE HUMAN RIGHTS

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
ARGUMENT, LIKE REPRESENTATIVE

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
CAROLYN MALONEY, WHO DELIVERED A

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
SPEECH ON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
ABOUT THE NEED TO COMBAT TALIBAN

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
REPRESSIONS, FEATURING A

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
STRIKING VISUAL AID.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
>> I SALUTE THE BUSH

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
ADMINISTRATION FOR BALANCING WAR

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
WITH COMPASSION.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
FOR DROPPING FOOD AS WELL AS

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
BOMBS.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
EVEN IN WAR, WE ARE SHOWING A

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE AND

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
HUMAN RIGHTS THAT THE TALIBAN

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
WILL NEVER KNOW.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, IT DOESN'T

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
GET MUCH MORE "THE MONTH AFTER

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
9/11" THAN A WHITE DEMOCRAT IN A

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
"FUCK YOU" BURQA SALUTING THE

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
TO HUMAN RIGHTS.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
AND THE PROBLEM THERE IS, YOU

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
COULD BE REVEALING THE SOLUTION

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
FOR WORLD HUNGER, BUT IF YOU'RE

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
A WHITE LADY WHO THREW ON A

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
BURQA FOR THE DRAMA, YOU'RE

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
FUNDAMENTALLY DISTRACTING FROM

07:30.000 --> 07:30.000
YOUR POINT.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
AS FOR "WE DROPPED FOOD AS WELL

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
AS BOMBS," THOSE TWO DO NOT

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
AND WE DROPPED A LOT OF THE

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
SECOND.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
OVER 71,000 AFGHAN AND PAKISTANI

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
CIVILIANS ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
DIED AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
WAR, WITH MANY MORE INJURED OR

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
DISPLACED.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
AS FOR OUR PROGRAM OF DRONE

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
STRIKES, THEY DIDN'T JUST KILL

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
CIVILIANS -- THEY TRAUMATIZED AN

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
ENTIRE GENERATION.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
>> THE VILLAGERS CALL THEM

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
PLANES WITHOUT MEN.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
SHEZ AMAN SAYS HIS

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
NINE-YEAR-OLD SON, SULEIMAN, WAS

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
KILLED BY A DRONE THREE MONTHS

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
AGO, ALONG WITH THE FATHERS OF

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
ALL OF THESE CHILDREN.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
>> I'M SCARED THEY'LL BOMB US.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
THEY KILLED MY FATHER AND I'M

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
AFRAID THEY'LL BOMB US TOO.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
>> I CAN'T WALK OUTSIDE MY HOME

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
BECAUSE I'M SCARED.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
I'M EVEN SCARED AT HOME.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
>> John: YEAH, IT'S TERRIBLE.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
SO IF CAROLYN MALONEY WANTS TO

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
ILLUSTRATE "ALL" THE MAJOR

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
THREATS AFGHAN SOCIETY'S FACED

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
IN RECENT YEARS, SHE MAY WANT TO

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
DELIVER HER NEXT SPEECH DRESSED

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
LIKE A FUCKING DRONE.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
AND THOSE STRIKES ARE JUST ONE

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
PART OF THE ANSWER TO OUR SECOND

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
QUESTION, WHICH IS,

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
"WHAT EXACTLY DID WE DO IN

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
AFGHANISTAN?"

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
BECAUSE THE U.S. CAME IN WITH

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
BIG PLANS, PROMISING TO SET UP A

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
MODERN, CENTRALIZED DEMOCRACY.

08:40.000 --> 08:40.000
AND YET, INSTEAD OF ENGAGING

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
WITH AND UNDERSTANDING THE

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
COUNTRY'S COMPLEX LOCAL

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
POLITICAL POWERS, WE ADOPTED A

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
POLICY OF PAYING OFF AND

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
CO-OPTING LOCAL WARLORDS AND

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WHICH ERODED

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
TRUST QUICKLY BETWEEN THE AFGHAN

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
PEOPLE AND THE BLATANTLY CORRUPT

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
GOVERNMENT THAT WE HELPED FUEL.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
BY 2006, IN THE WORDS OF ONE

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
RETIRED COLONEL, THE GOVERNMENT

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
HAD "SELF-ORGANIZED INTO A

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
KLEPTOCRACY" UNDER WHICH PEOPLE

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
IN POWER COULD PLUNDER THE

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
ECONOMY WITHOUT RESTRAINT.

09:05.000 --> 09:11.000
AND YET, SUCCESSIVE

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
ADMINISTRATIONS KEPT GIVING US

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
ROSY ASSESSMENTS LIKE THIS:

09:14.000 --> 09:14.000
>> THE TALIBAN HAVE BEEN DRIVEN

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
FROM POWER, AL-QAEDA HAS BEEN

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
DRIVEN FROM ITS CAMPS, AND

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
AFGHANISTAN IS FREE.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
THAT'S WHY I SAY WE HAVE MADE

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
REMARKABLE PROGRESS.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
>> THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN IS

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
ENDING.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
AL-QAEDA HAS BEEN DECIMATED.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
OSAMA BIN LADEN IS DEAD.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
WE HAVE MADE REAL PROGRESS.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
>> WE MAKE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
AFGHANISTAN.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
AND WITH TIME, WE'LL HAVE IT

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
SPINNING LIKE A TOP.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
>> John: OH.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
OH, YOU WILL, WILL YOU?

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
BUT I GUESS HE'S TECHNICALLY

09:45.000 --> 09:45.000
RIGHT THERE. WE DID LEAVE AFGHANISTAN

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
"SPINNING LIKE A TOP," YOU KNOW,

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
THOSE THINGS THAT FAMOUSLY SPIN

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
FOREVER AND NEVER COLLAPSE.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
THE FACT IS, THINGS OBVIOUSLY

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
WEREN'T GOING AS WELL AS ALL

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
THREE OF THOSE MEN PUBLICLY

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
CLAIMED, AS WE NOW KNOW -- NOT

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
LEAST THANKS TO THIS REVELATION

10:00.000 --> 10:00.000
TWO YEARS AGO.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
>> ACCORDING TO MORE THAN 2,000

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
PAGES OF DOCUMENTS OBTAINED BY

10:02.000 --> 10:02.000
"THE WASHINGTON POST," MILITARY

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
COMMANDERS, DIPLOMATS, AND AID

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
WORKERS PRIVATELY AND IN BLUNT

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
TERMS DESCRIBE AN UNCLEAR

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
MISSION, A FAILED STRATEGY AND

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
EFFORTS TO SWAY PUBLIC OPINION.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
AMONG THE REVELATIONS, RETIRED

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
GENERAL DOUGLAS LUTE, THE AFGHAN

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
WAR CZAR UNDER PRESIDENTS BUSH

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
AND OBAMA, SAYING IN 2015,

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
"WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO HERE?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE FOGGIEST

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
NOTION OF WHAT WE WERE

10:24.000 --> 10:24.000
UNDERTAKING."

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
>> John: WOW.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
THAT SOUNDS LESS LIKE SOMETHING

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
YOU'D EXPECT TO HEAR FROM A

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
GENERAL AND MORE LIKE THE

10:32.000 --> 10:32.000
INTERNAL MONOLOGUE

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
FOR SIR IAN McKELLEN IN THIS

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
PHOTO FROM THE SET OF "CATS."

10:34.000 --> 10:34.000
"WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO HERE?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
HAS ANYONE GOT A PLAN FOR WHAT

10:36.000 --> 10:36.000
THIS IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
THE END?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
I HAVEN'T THE FOGGIEST NOTION OF

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
WHAT WE'RE UNDERTAKING."

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
THOSE INTERVIEWS WERE COLLECTED

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
BY SIGAR -- THE SPECIAL

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
AFGHANISTAN RECONSTRUCTION, A

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
GOVERNMENT OFFICE TASKED WITH

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
PRODUCING HONEST REPORTS ABOUT

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
HOW THINGS WERE REALLY GOING

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
THERE, ONE OF WHICH NOTED "THE

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
U.S. GOVERNMENT'S GOALS WERE

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
OFTEN OPERATIONALLY IMPRACTICAL

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
OR CONCEPTUALLY INCOHERENT."

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
SIGAR'S MANDATE WAS TO PROMOTE

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
EFFICIENCY AND PREVENT WASTE,

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
FRAUD, AND ABUSE.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
AND I KNOW FOCUSING ON WASTEFUL

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
SPENDING MAY SEEM LIKE THE

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
ABSOLUTE LEAST OF THE ISSUES

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
HERE, BUT SOMETIMES KNOWING

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
EXACTLY WHERE THE MONEY WAS

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
SPENT HELPS YOU UNDERSTAND THE

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
SCALE OF THE MESS WE'VE LEFT

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
BEHIND.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
BECAUSE SO MUCH MONEY WENT TO

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
MILITARY CONTRACTORS TO SET UP

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
PROJECTS WITH NO PLAN FOR HOW

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
THEY'D SURVIVE AFTER WE WERE

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
GONE.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
HERE'S THE HEAD OF SIGAR

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
IDENTIFYING ONE EXPENDITURE IN

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
PARTICULAR.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
>> I THINK THE WORST CASE SO FAR

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
OF JUST STUPID WASTE HAS BEEN

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
THE PURCHASE OF THE HELICOPTERS

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
AND AIRPLANES FOR THE AFGHAN AIR

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
WING.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
IT'S CLEARLY RISKING THAT THOSE

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
PLANES AND THOSE HELICOPTERS ARE

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
JUST GONNA END UP ON THE TARMAC

11:45.000 --> 11:45.000
RUSTING.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
>> THEY CAN'T EVEN USE THE

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
PLANES THEY CURRENTLY HAVE.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
OVER 70% OF THE MAINTENANCE IS

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
BEING DONE BY U.S. CONTRACTORS,

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
NOT BY THE AFGHANS.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
THEY DON'T HAVE THE PILOTS,

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
THEY DON'T HAVE THE GROUND

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
CREWS, THEY DON'T HAVE THE

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
WORKERS TO --

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
>> SO WHY ARE WE BUYING THEM?

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
>> John: YEAH, IT IS.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
THAT CLIP IS FROM SEVEN YEARS

12:08.000 --> 12:08.000
AGO, BUT IT'S NOT LIKE, SINCE

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
THEN, WE'VE FIXED THE UNDERLYING

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
PROBLEM. LAST MONTH, DEFENSE OFFICIALS

12:11.000 --> 12:11.000
WERE MAINTAINING THAT AIRCRAFT

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
COULD STILL BE USED AFTER WE

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
WERE GONE BECAUSE AFGHANS COULD

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
SIMPLY SERVICE THEM WITH

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
"U.S. CONTRACTORS LOOKING OVER

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
THEIR SHOULDERS VIA ZOOM OR

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
COACHING THEM OVER THE PHONE."

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
WHICH IS SO CLOSE TO NOTHING

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
THAT I'M HONESTLY SURPRISED THE

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
U.S. DIDN'T JUST BUY EVERY

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
AFGHAN TECHNICIAN A MASTERCLASS

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
SUBSCRIPTION AND TELL THEM THAT

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
ANNA WINTOUR'S COURSE WOULD

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
SUPERCHARGE THEIR CREATIVITY.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
AND THAT'S EMBLEMATIC OF OUR

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
BEHAVIOR IN AFGHANISTAN: WE CAME

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
IN, BUILT SOMETHING ON THE

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
AMERICAN MODEL, ALMOST WHOLLY

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
DEPENDENT ON AMERICAN SUPPORT,

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
AND PUT NEXT TO NO EFFORT INTO

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
ENSURING THAT IT WAS SUSTAINABLE

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
AFTER WE LEFT.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
TAKE THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
FOREIGN GRANTS FINANCED AROUND

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
75% OF ITS PUBLIC SPENDING,

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
MEANING THAT, AS THE TALIBAN

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
TAKES OVER, THAT MONEY

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
PRESUMABLY DRIES UP, AND THE

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
ECONOMY IS NOW POISED TO

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
COLLAPSE.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
AND IT'S NOT JUST THE ECONOMY

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
THAT'S IN DANGER HERE.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
THERE WERE REAL, MEANINGFUL

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
GAINS -- PARTICULARLY FOR WOMEN,

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
WHO'D SUFFERED TERRIBLY UNDER

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
THE PREVIOUS TALIBAN REGIME.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
MILLIONS OF GIRLS WERE ALLOWED

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
TO ATTEND SCHOOL FOR THE FIRST

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
TIME, AND WOMEN JOINED THE

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
MILITARY, THE POLICE, AND HELD

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
POLITICAL OFFICE.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
BUT THOSE ACHIEVEMENTS ARE IN

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
REAL JEOPARDY NOW.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
AND SOME WHO LED THE WAY -- LIKE

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
MAHBOUBA SERAJ, AN AFGHAN

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
WOMEN'S ACTIVIST -- ARE ACUTELY

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
AWARE OF THAT.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
>> I'M GOING TO SAY TO THE WHOLE

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
WORLD, SHAME ON YOU.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
ARE YOU USING ALL OF US?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
ARE WE BEING JUST PAWNS IN YOUR

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
HANDS?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
IS THAT WHAT IT IS?

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
THEY JUST MADE DECISIONS WITH

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
THEIR GUT FEELINGS OR WHATEVER,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
ALL OF THESE MEN OF THE WORLD

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
THAT THEY WERE IN POWER, AND

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
THEY'RE DESTROYING SOMETHING

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
THAT WE WORKED SO HARD FOR.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN AFGHANISTAN

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
TODAY IS GOING TO PUT THIS

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
COUNTRY 200 YEARS BACK.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
>> John: THAT IS INCREDIBLY HARD

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
TO HEAR.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
AND THE THING IS, SHE'S RIGHT.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
THE PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN "HAVE"

13:59.000 --> 13:59.000
BEEN TREATED LIKE PAWNS.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
WHILE THERE WERE GAINS, THE

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
INITIAL IMPULSE THAT LED TO THEM

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
WAS PURELY U.S. INTERESTS.

14:02.000 --> 14:02.000
AND FOR 20 YEARS, FOR MULTIPLE

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
REASONS, THE U.S. AND VARIOUS

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
AFGHAN GOVERNMENTS DIDN'T SECURE

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
THOSE GAINS.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
AND EVEN THOUGH THIS WEEK HAS

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
BROUGHT INCREDIBLE SCENES OF

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
AFGHAN WOMEN LEADING PROTESTS

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
AGAINST THE INCOMING TALIBAN

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
REGIME, ODDS ARE, MUCH OF THAT

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
PROGRESS IS NOW SET TO BE

14:15.000 --> 14:22.000
OBLITERATED.

14:22.000 --> 14:22.000
BUT HERE IS WHERE IT GETS REALLY

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
HARD.

14:23.000 --> 14:23.000
WHAT WAS THE ANSWER HERE?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
TO STAY INDEFINITELY?

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
IT IS VERY HARD TO MAKE A GOOD

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
CASE FOR THAT, ESPECIALLY GIVEN

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
THE TALIBAN HAD BEEN

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
STRENGTHENING IN RECENT YEARS

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
AND HAD MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
WERE GOING TO ESCALATE VIOLENCE

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
UNLESS WE LEFT.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
WHICH MOST PEOPLE AGREE, WE HAD

14:34.000 --> 14:40.000
TO DO.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
THE PROBLEM IS THOUGH, JUST AS

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
WE WENT IN FOCUSED ENTIRELY ON

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
U.S. INTERESTS, WE'RE LEAVING

14:45.000 --> 14:45.000
THE EXACT SAME WAY.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
AND THAT BRINGS US TO WHAT WE'RE

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
DOING RIGHT NOW.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
BECAUSE THIS EXIT WAS SET IN

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
MOTION IN FEBRUARY OF 2020, WHEN

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION STRUCK

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
A DEAL WITH THE TALIBAN FOR A

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
TOTAL U.S. WITHDRAWAL BY MAY OF

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
THIS YEAR.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
IN EXCHANGE, THE TALIBAN AGREED

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
NOT TO LET AFGHANISTAN BECOME A

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
HAVEN FOR TERRORISTS, AND TO

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
START PEACE TALKS WITH THE

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
AFGHAN GOVERNMENT.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
ALTHOUGH, NOTABLY, THAT DEAL

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
EXCLUDED THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT,

15:06.000 --> 15:06.000
MAKING THIS LINE FROM

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
MIKE POMPEO A LITTLE

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
HARD TO TAKE.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
>> WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT, THE

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN IS FOR

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
AFGHANS TO DETERMINE.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
THE U.S.-TALIBAN DEAL CREATES

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
THE CONDITIONS FOR AFGHANS TO DO

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
JUST THAT.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
>> John: WELL, HOLD ON.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
YOU NEVER WANT TWO PEOPLE IN A

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
ROOM DETERMINING YOUR FUTURE

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
WITHOUT YOU, ESPECIALLY IF ONE

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
OF THEM IS THE TALIBAN.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
HOW DOES POMPEO EXPECT THEM TO

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
REACT TO THAT?

15:35.000 --> 15:35.000
CONGRATULATIONS, AFGHANS.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF WHAT

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
SOMEONE ELSE DETERMINED THE REST

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
OF YOUR LIFE WILL BE.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
NOW, BIDEN PUSHED OUR EXIT DATE

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
BACK SLIGHTLY, TO AUGUST 31, BUT

15:43.000 --> 15:43.000
HE BASICALLY FOLLOWED THROUGH

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
DEAL.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
AND WHILE THE TALIBAN LARGELY

15:48.000 --> 15:48.000
STUCK BY THEIR PROMISE NOT TO

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
ATTACK U.S. PERSONNEL, ALMOST

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
IMMEDIATELY AFTER SIGNING THAT

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
DEAL, THEY CARRIED OUT AT LEAST

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
76 ATTACKS ACROSS 24 AFGHAN

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
PROVINCES AND HAVE SINCE PURSUED

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
ASSASSINATION CAMPAIGNS OF

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS,

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
JOURNALISTS, AND CIVIL SOCIETY

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
ACTORS, AND JUST THIS MAY,

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
BEHEADED AN AFGHAN INTERPRETER

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
FOR THE U.S. ARMY.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
AND YET, ALL THE WHILE, THEY'VE

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
MADE A BIG SHOW OF PRESENTING

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
THEMSELVES IN A MORE MODERN,

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
FLATTERING LIGHT -- SOMETHING

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
THAT CONTINUED THIS WEEK.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
>> THIS WAS A SMARTER, MORE

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
MEDIA-SAVVY TALIBAN ONE.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
SENIOR LEADERS CLAIMING THEY

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
WANT TO FORM AN "INCLUSIVE,

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
ISLAMIC GOVERNMENT."

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
THE GROUP IS ESTABLISHING A

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
"CIVILIAN CASUALTY PREVENTION

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
AND COMPLAINTS COMMISSION,"

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
TWEETING OUT WHATSAPP PHONE

16:32.000 --> 16:32.000
NUMBERS FOR AFGHANS TO SEND IN

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
COMPLAINTS.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
>> John: WOW, THAT IS SOMETHING.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
AND SET ASIDE THE FACT THAT

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
"TALIBAN COMPLAINTS DEPARTMENT"

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
SOUNDS LIKE A SKETCH ELON MUSK

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
PITCHED TO "SNL," I'M NOT SURE

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
IT'S GOING TO BE ALL THAT

16:43.000 --> 16:43.000
EFFECTIVE.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
INSTITUTING A COMPLAINT BOX IN

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
SCOTT RUDIN'S OFFICE.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
THE PROBLEM WITH THE BEHAVIOR

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
THERE ISN'T "LACK OF AWARENESS."

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
A SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED TALIBAN

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKELY HERE.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
THEIR TIES TO AL-QAEDA ONLY

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
APPEAR TO BE DEEPENING.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
AND THEY'RE NOW EVEN BETTER

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
ARMED.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
THE AFGHAN FORCES FELL SO

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
QUICKLY, THEY LEFT BEHIND

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
BRAND-NEW BOXES OF GUNS AND

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
GRENADE LAUNCHERS, WHICH TALIBAN

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
FIGHTERS HAVE BEEN FILMING

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
THEMSELVES OPENING IN THE

17:10.000 --> 17:10.000
WORLD'S GRIMMEST UNBOXING

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
VIDEOS.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
INCIDENTS WHICH LED TO THIS

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
EXCHANGE:

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
>> WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BILLIONS

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
OF DOLLARS WORTH OF WEAPONRY

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
THAT THE U.S. GAVE AFGHANISTAN?

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
>> WE DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
PICTURE, OBVIOUSLY, OF WHERE

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
EVERY ARTICLE OF DEFENSE

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
MATERIALS HAS GONE.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
BUT CERTAINLY A FAIR AMOUNT OF

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
IT HAS FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
THE TALIBAN, AND, AH, OBVIOUSLY

17:33.000 --> 17:39.000
WE DON'T HAVE A SENSE THAT

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
THEY ARE GOING TO READILY HAND

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
IT OVER TO US AT THE AIRPORT.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
>> John: AH, YEAH, I THINK

17:45.000 --> 17:45.000
THAT'S A SAFE ASSUMPTION.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
BUT HEY, WE COULD ALWAYS TEXT

17:46.000 --> 17:46.000
THE TALIBAN COMPLAINT DEPARTMENT

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
I'M SURE WE'LL BE DEALT WITH

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
SWIFTLY.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
SO HERE WE ARE, 20 YEARS OF WAR

17:50.000 --> 17:50.000
AND DESTRUCTION.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AFGHANS

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
KILLED.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
MANY MORE TRAUMATIZED.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
AND THE OVERALL SENSE YOU HAVE

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
AT THIS POINT IS OF DEEP

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
BETRAYAL: BETRAYAL OF THE

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
PROMISES THAT WERE MADE TO THE

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
AFGHAN PEOPLE AND BETRAYAL OF

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
THE U.S. SERVICE MEMBERS ASKED

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
TO EXECUTE THOSE SELF-SERVING

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
PROMISES AND WHO ARE NOW LEFT

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
ASKING THEMSELVES, "WHAT DID I

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
JUST DO?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
WHAT WAS THIS ALL FOR?"

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
THE MILITARY SENT OUT AN EMAIL

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
TO 9 MILLION VETERANS THIS WEEK

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
OFFERING A LIST OF MENTAL HEALTH

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
RESOURCES WITH NOTES LIKE,

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
"IF YOU'RE HAVING THOUGHTS OF

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
SUICIDE, CALL THIS NUMBER."

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
AND IF YOU ARE, DO.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
THIS IS A GRIM SITUATION.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
AND THERE ARE IMMEDIATE

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
DECISIONS THAT NEED TO BE MADE

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
THAT HAVE LIFE-OR-DEATH

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
CONSEQUENCES FOR AFGHANS WHO PUT

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
THEIR TRUST IN US, LIKE THIS

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
ACTIVIST:

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
>> FATIMA, THAT'S NOT HER REAL

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
NAME, AND HER CHILDREN HAVE GONE

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
INTO HIDING AFTER DEATH THREATS

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
FROM THE TALIBAN FOR HER WORK IN

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
EMPOWERING OTHER WOMEN.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS BUILDING A

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
NEW AND BETTER AFGHANISTAN, BUT

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
NOW SHE'S VIEWED AS A SPY AND

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
ENEMY COLLABORATOR.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
>> I FEEL EXTREMELY ABANDONED.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
I AM IN -- I AM IN DANGER.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
IT'S NOT ONLY THAT I AM IN

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
DANGER, NOW MY KIDS ARE IN

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
DANGER.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
THEY WON'T -- THEY WON'T LEAVE

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
US -- THEY WON'T LEAVE ME ALIVE.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
>> John: WE BEAR RESPONSIBILITY

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
FOR THE POSITION SHE'S IN.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
WE SAID WE'D PROTECT PEOPLE WHO

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
DID COURAGEOUS THINGS THAT

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
PISSED OFF THE TALIBAN, LIKE

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
"ADVOCATE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS,"

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
EVEN IF IT WOUND UP PUTTING A

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
TARGET ON THEIR BACK.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
AND NOW IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
WALKING AWAY GOING, "WHOA, COOL

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
TARGET, HOW'D YOU GET THAT?

19:15.000 --> 19:15.000
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
DON'T ANSWER, WE'RE LEAVING."

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
AND AGAIN, I AM NOT ADVOCATING

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
FOR STAYING.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
AT ALL.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
WHAT I'M SAYING IS, WE'RE IN THE

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
MIDST OF A MASSIVE HUMANITARIAN

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
CRISIS, AND WE HAVE A CLEAR

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
OBLIGATION TO TAKE IN AFGHANS

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
WHO ARE NOW VULNERABLE -- AND

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
NOT JUST THOSE THAT WORKED WITH

19:33.000 --> 19:33.000
U.S. TROOPS, BUT THOSE, LIKE

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
FATIMA AND HER CHILDREN, WHOSE

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
LIVES ARE NOW AT GRAVE RISK.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
ALTHOUGH SOME CONSERVATIVE

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
COMMENTATORS ARE ALREADY TRYING

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
TO GET WAY OUT AHEAD OF THAT.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
>> IF HISTORY IS ANY GUIDE, AND

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
IT'S ALWAYS A GUIDE, WE WILL SEE

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
MANY REFUGEES FROM AFGHANISTAN

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
RESETTLE IN OUR COUNTRY IN

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
COMING MONTHS, PROBABLY IN YOUR

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
NEIGHBORHOOD.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
AND OVER THE NEXT DECADE, THAT

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
NUMBER MAY SWELL TO THE

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
MILLIONS.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
SO FIRST WE INVADE, AND THEN WE

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
ARE INVADED.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
>> THE LESSON OF THIS 20-YEAR

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
WAR CANNOT BE THAT EVERY TIME WE

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
TURN A COUNTRY UPSIDE DOWN OR

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
MAKE HUGE MISTAKES, OUR

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
IMMIGRATION LAWS, OUR REFUGEE

20:07.000 --> 20:12.000
LAWS NO LONGER APPLY.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, FUCK OFF,

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
YOU TAG TEAM RACIAL PANIC

20:15.000 --> 20:15.000
GOBLINS.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
SECOND, THE NOTION OF

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
"EVERY TIME WE TURN A COUNTRY

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
UPSIDE DOWN" IS AN INCREDIBLE

20:21.000 --> 20:21.000
THING TO JUST BLOW PAST.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
MAYBE THAT'S THE LESSON HERE,

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
LAURA.

20:24.000 --> 20:24.000
MAYBE DON'T KEEP TURNING

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
COUNTRIES UPSIDE DOWN IN THE

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
FIRST PLACE.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
AS FOR, "OUR REFUGEE LAWS NO

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
LONGER APPLY"?

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
WE ARE A BIG PART OF WHY THOSE

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
PEOPLE ARE REFUGEES.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
HELPING THEM NOW ISN'T CHARITY,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
IT'S DOING THE BARE MINIMUM.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
REFUSING TO HELP A NEIGHBOR

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
WHOSE HOME JUST BURNED DOWN IS

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
SHITTY.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
DOING IT WHEN YOU HELPED START

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
THE FIRE IS FUCKING MONSTROUS.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
AND THE THING IS, THEY'RE NOT

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
THE ONLY ONES WHO'VE BEEN BLITHE

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
ABOUT THE FATE OF THE AFGHANS.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
BIDEN'S FAILURE TO PLAN HERE IS

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
ASTONISHING.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
BUT HIS CONTINUED INDIFFERENCE

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
TO THE LIVES OF ANYONE WHO'S NOT

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
AMERICAN ISN'T SURPRISING.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
HE'S FELT THIS WAY FOR YEARS.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
ACCORDING TO THE LATE DIPLOMAT

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
RICHARD HOLBROOKE'S DIARY, IN

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
2010, THE TWO MEN HAD A

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
CONVERSATION, AND BIDEN TOLD

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
HIM THE U.S. HAD TO WITHDRAW

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
EVERY TROOP FROM AFGHANISTAN,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
REGARDLESS OF THE CONSEQUENCES

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
FOR WOMEN OR ANYONE ELSE.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
AND WHEN HOLBROOKE ASKED HIM

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
ABOUT AMERICAN OBLIGATIONS TO

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
THOSE WHO'D BE IN DANGER IF WE

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
LEFT, BIDEN MENTIONED THE U.S.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
WITHDRAWAL FROM SOUTHEAST ASIA

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
IN 1973, SAYING, "FUCK THAT, WE

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
WE DID IT IN VIETNAM, NIXON AND

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
KISSINGER GOT AWAY WITH IT."

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
AND MAY I SAY, JOE?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
A-PLUS CHOICE OF HISTORICAL

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
ROLE-MODELS THERE.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
WHEN YOU'RE ROLLING WITH DICK

21:36.000 --> 21:36.000
AND THE KISS, YOU KNOW YOU'RE

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
ROLLING ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
HISTORY.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
AND LAST FEBRUARY, BIDEN DOUBLED

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
DOWN ON THAT ARGUMENT.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
>> DON'T YOU BEAR SOME

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OUTCOME

21:47.000 --> 21:47.000
IF THE TALIBAN ENDS UP BACK IN

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
CONTROL AND WOMEN END UP LOSING

21:48.000 --> 21:48.000
THE RIGHTS?

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
>> NO, I DON'T.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
DO I BEAR RESPONSIBILITY?

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
ZERO RESPONSIBILITY.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
THE RESPONSIBILITY I HAVE IS TO

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
PROTECT AMERICA'S NATIONAL

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
SELF-INTEREST AND NOT PUT OUR

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
WOMEN AND MEN IN HARM'S WAY TO

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
TRY TO SOLVE EVERY SINGLE

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
PROBLEM IN THE WORLD BY USE OF

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
FORCE.

22:04.000 --> 22:04.000
THAT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY AS

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
PRESIDENT.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
>> John: OKAY, REAL QUICK:

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE A ZERO

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
WITH YOUR FINGERS TO INDICATE

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
YOU MEAN ZERO.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
YOU'RE AN ADULT MAN, NOT

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
A CHILD ENSEMBLE MEMBER OF

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
BROADWAY'S "MATILDA."

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
THOUGH I WILL SAY, IF BIDEN

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
WANTS TO ARGUE FOR ISOLATIONISM

22:23.000 --> 22:23.000
GOING FORWARD, HE'S WELCOME TO

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
DO THAT.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
BUT WHAT HE CAN'T DO IS USE THAT

22:25.000 --> 22:25.000
AS A JUSTIFICATION TO DISMISS

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
THE FATES OF PEOPLE IN WHOSE

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
COUNTRY WE'VE ALREADY

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
DISASTROUSLY INTERVENED.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
BECAUSE WE HAVE A NON-ZERO DUTY

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
AT THIS POINT TO DO EVERYTHING

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
WE CAN TO HELP THEM.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
AND THAT MEANS GETTING AS MANY

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
PEOPLE OUT AS WE CAN.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
AND ADVOCATES FOR REFUGEES SAY

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
THE FIRST THING TO DO IS SECURE

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
A PERIMETER AT THE KABUL

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
AIRPORT, MAKING SURE PEOPLE HAVE

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
A SAFE WAY TO GET THERE AND GET

22:45.000 --> 22:51.000
INSIDE, BECAUSE THAT HAS BEEN

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
TOTAL CHAOS THIS WEEK, TO THE

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
POINT THAT MANY OF THE DEPARTING

22:54.000 --> 22:54.000
FLIGHTS HAVE LEFT WITH EMPTY

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
SEATS.

22:55.000 --> 22:55.000
AND THE FACT THERE ARE PEOPLE

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
WITH VISAS UNABLE TO GET ONTO

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
THE PLANES IS BAD ENOUGH.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
BUT THERE ARE MANY MORE AT-RISK

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
AFGHANS WHO ARE STILL STUCK IN

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
THE VISA PROCESS, AND WE SHOULD

23:07.000 --> 23:12.000
BE GETTING THEM TO THE U.S. AS

23:12.000 --> 23:12.000
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO THEY

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
CAN THEN SAFELY FINISH THEIR

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
PAPERWORK -- AND THAT CAN BE

23:14.000 --> 23:14.000
ACHIEVED BY GRANTING THEM

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
CATEGORICAL "HUMANITARIAN

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
PAROLE."

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
AND TO THE EXTENT ANY HESITATION

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
ABOUT DOING THIS IS DUE TO FEAR

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
OF POLITICAL BLOWBACK THANKS TO

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
IDIOTS LIKE THESE, CALL YOUR

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
REPRESENTATIVES AND TELL THEM

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
THAT YOU CARE ABOUT THIS.

23:29.000 --> 23:34.000
BECAUSE IF THEY THINK THAT YOU

23:34.000 --> 23:34.000
DON'T, IT IS NOT GOING TO

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
HAPPEN.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
LOOK: THE CHAOS THIS WEEK IS

23:36.000 --> 23:36.000
ALREADY A STAIN ON BIDEN'S

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
LEGACY -- THE ONLY QUESTION IS,

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
HOW BIG DOES HE WANT THAT STAIN

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
TO BE?

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
AND THAT IS REALLY UP TO HIM.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
BUT MORE BROADLY, WE, AS A

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
COUNTRY, NEED TO TAKE A HARD

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE IN

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
AFGHANISTAN -- WHICH IS LIKELY

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
TO BE DESTABILIZED FOR DECADES

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
TO COME.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
SO WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THAT?

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
NOT MUCH NOW.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
NO AMOUNT OF BRUTE FORCE OR

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
PERSEVERANCE IS GOING TO CLEAR

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
UP THE CLUSTERFUCK THAT WE

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
HELPED FUCK INTO EXISTENCE.

24:02.000 --> 24:02.000
AND I REALIZE THAT'S A

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
QUINTESSENTIALLY UNAMERICAN

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
IDEA -- TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
CAN'T ALWAYS CONTROL SOMETHING

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
WE WANT TO CONTROL OR ACHIEVE

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
SOMETHING WE WANT TO ACHIEVE.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
BUT THE TRUTH IS, WE CAN'T.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
I KNOW THAT FEELS FUTILE.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
BUT ASSUMING WE CAN GO INTO

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
ANOTHER COUNTRY AND FIX

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
EVERYTHING BY SIMPLY IMPOSING

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
OUR WILL IS LARGELY WHAT LED US

24:24.000 --> 24:24.000
TO WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
WE HAVE SPENT DECADES CLAIMING

24:25.000 --> 24:25.000
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE THE

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
WORLD'S PROBLEMS -- ALBEIT

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY WHEN IT

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
HELPED SOLVE OUR OWN -- AND THE

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
RESULT HAS BEEN, IN THE WORDS OF

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
THIS PROFESSIONAL

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
PEARL-CLUTCHER, THAT WE'VE

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
TURNED ONE COUNTRY AFTER ANOTHER

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
UPSIDE DOWN.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
SO WE SHOULD MAYBE STOP DOING

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
THAT.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
BUT IN THE MEANTIME, THE LEAST

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
WE COULD DO IS HELP ALLEVIATE

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AHEAD.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
IN AFGHANISTAN FROM HERE ON OUT,

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
THERE IS NO UNIVERSE WHERE

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
AMERICA BEARS ZERO

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
RESPONSIBILITY.

24:53.000 --> 25:00.000
AND NOW THIS.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
>> Announcer: AND NOW, TAMRON

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
HALL WILL HAVE YOU KNOW SHE IS

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
50.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
>> AND HERE SHE IS, THE ONE, THE

25:09.000 --> 25:14.000
ONLY, THE 50 AND FABULOUS TAMRON

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
HALL!

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
>> I HAVE, IN MY 40s, NOW THAT

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
I'M 50.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
I'M 59.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
ON A PERSONAL NOTE, I'M 50.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
>41 AND DON'T CARE.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
WAIT TILL YOU TURN 50.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
I'M 50, YOU ARE 54.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS ON

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
"SESAME STREET" HAVE BEEN

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
HELPING KIDS AND FAMILIES AROUND

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
THE WORLD AND ALL KINDS OF WAYS

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
50 YEARS, THAT'S HOW OLD I AM.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
>> WOW.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
>> LISTEN, I AM -- AS THE KIDS

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
SAY, I'M 50.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
HOW DID I NOT KNOW THAT?

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
OKAY, I AM 50 YEARS OLD.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
I'M 50.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
I'M 50.

25:59.000 --> 25:59.000
I'M 50.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
THIS IS THE BEST TACO I'VE EVER

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
HAD IN MY LIFE.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
I'M 50.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
>> John: MOVING ON.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
BEFORE WE GO, A QUICK WORD ABOUT

26:07.000 --> 26:07.000
HAMMERS.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
SOME ARE EENSY.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
SOME ARE CHONKOS.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
SOME HAVE A LITTLE CLAW ON THE

26:10.000 --> 26:10.000
END FOR PULLING NAILS.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
OTHERS HAVE A LITTLE ROUND NUB

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
AND NO ONE KNOWS WHY.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
AND ONE HAMMER IS ACTUALLY A

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
PRACTICING PERSONAL INJURY

26:18.000 --> 26:18.000
ATTORNEY, WHICH

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER FROM THIS

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
"AND NOW" SEGMENT WE AIRED IN

26:20.000 --> 26:20.000
2019.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
>> GREEDY INSURANCE COMPANIES

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
PLAY DIRTY.

26:22.000 --> 26:22.000
BRING IT ON!

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
I'M JIM ADLER, THE TEXAS HAMMER.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
I'M JIM ADLER, THE TEXAS HAMMER.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
AND I DO MY BEST TO BRING 'EM

26:28.000 --> 26:28.000
DOWN!

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
I GET ANGRIER THAN A JUNKYARD

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
DOG.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
I STAND TOUGH AND CARRY A BIG

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
HAMMER.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
I GROWL AND BARK.

26:35.000 --> 26:35.000
>> WAKE UP!

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
>> IT'S HAMMER TIME!

26:37.000 --> 26:43.000
I'M JIM ADLER, THE TEXAS HAMMER!

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
>> John: YOU GET THE IDEA,

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
RIGHT?

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
HE'S THE TEXAS HAMMER.

26:46.000 --> 26:46.000
HE CARRIES A HAMMER.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
HE TALKS ABOUT HAMMERS.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
FOR A WHILE IN THE MIDDLE HE

26:48.000 --> 26:48.000
TALKS ABOUT GROWLING AND BARKING

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
LIKE A DOG, WHICH IS A BIT

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
CONFUSING, BECAUSE THAT'S NOT A

26:50.000 --> 26:50.000
THING HAMMERS DO, BUT THEN IT'S

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
RIGHT BACK TO HAMMER TIME, BABY.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
NOW, WE AIRED THAT BECAUSE WE

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
THOUGHT HIS ADS WERE FANTASTIC.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
BUT SINCE THEN, WE'VE DISCOVERED

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
JUST HOW MUCH MONEY JIM ADLER

26:57.000 --> 26:57.000
PUTS INTO THEM.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
HE CLAIMS TO HAVE SPENT OVER

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
$100 MILLION DOLLARS ON ADS

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
SINCE 2000, AND AS YOU CAN SEE

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
FROM THIS TESTIMONIAL HE ONCE

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
FILMED FOR AN AD AGENCY HE

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
WORKED WITH, HE PUTS A LOT OF

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
THOUGHT INTO THEM TOO.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
>> A LAWYER IN ANOTHER STATE MAY

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
NOT WANT TO BE A HAMMER, OR BE A

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
TOUGH, SMART LAWYER, BUT THEY

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
UNDERSTAND THE IMAGE THAT THE

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
CLIENT WANTS TO PORTRAY.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
>> John: RIGHT.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
LAWYERS IN OTHER STATES MIGHT

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
NOT WANT TO BE TOUGH, SMART

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
LAWYERS.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
WISCONSIN LIKES ITS LAWYERS WEAK

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
AND SIMPLE.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
MICHIGAN PREFERS THEM LEAN AND

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
LETHARGIC.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
IDAHO WANTS EVERY ATTORNEY TO BE

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
DAMP AND DISTRACTED, WHILE HERE

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
IN NEW YORK, WE LIKE THEM SWEATY

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
AND SUSPENDED.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
UNFORTUNATELY FOR JIM ADLER

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
THOUGH, IT TURNS OUT THERE IS

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
ANOTHER LAWYER IN ANOTHER STATE

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
WHO WANTS TO BE A HAMMER TOO.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
>> I'M MIKE SLOCUMB.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
THE ALABAMA HAMMER!

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
IF YOU'VE BEEN INJURED, CALL ME

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
RIGHT NOW AND GET THE BIG CHECK.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
>> John: HI, MIKE!

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
NICE TO MEET YOU!

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
NOW, IF YOU'RE NOTICING ANY

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
SIMILARITIES, YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
BECAUSE WHEN JIM ADLER FOUND OUT

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
WHAT MIKE SLOCUMB WAS DOING, HE

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
FUCKING SUED HIM!

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
AND WHILE WE CAN'T GET INTO ALL

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
OF THE CLAIMS IN HIS VERY FUN

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
LAWSUIT, BASICALLY, HE'S

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
ALLEGING THAT MIKE SLOCUMB --

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
THE ALABAMA HAMMER -- HAD

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
"ADOPTED HIS FAMOUS PERSONA IN A

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
BRAZEN BID TO CONFUSE AND

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
DECEIVE CONSUMERS."

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
AND THE THING IS, HE'S NOT JUST

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
CLAIMING THE ALABAMA HAMMER IS

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
COPYING HIS NICKNAME.

28:09.000 --> 28:09.000
I'M GOING TO PLAY TWO OF THEIR

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
COMMERCIALS SIDE BY SIDE AND SEE

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
IF THEY LOOK SIMILAR TO YOU.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
>> GREEDY INSURANCE COMPANIES

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
PLAY DIRTY.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
BRING IT ON.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
>> CHEAP INSURANCE COMPANIES

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
PLAY ROUGH.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
I BEAT 'EM AT THEIR OWN GAME!

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
>> I'M JIM ADLER, THE TEXAS

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
HAMMER!

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
>> I'M MIKE SLOCUMB, THE ALABAMA

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
HAMMER!

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT!

28:30.000 --> 28:30.000
>> John: OH, COME ON!

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
NOW, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, SLOCUMB

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
DENIES ADLER'S CLAIMS --

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
INCLUDING THAT HE COPIED THAT

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
AD.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
AND I'M GONNA SAY, GOOD LUCK

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
DEFENDING THAT ARGUMENT.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
BUT I DO ACTUALLY HAVE A BIT OF

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
SYMPATHY FOR MIKE SLOCUMB.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
BECAUSE IF YOU WATCH HIS ADS

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
THAT AREN'T HAMMER-THEMED, IT

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
BECOMES CLEAR HOW MUCH MIKE

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
NEEDS THAT GIMMICK.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
BECAUSE THEY'RE A TOTAL MESS.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
THERE'S ONE WHERE HE'S A

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
"BIG BUCKS" HUNTER WHERE HE

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
SHOOTS DEER THAT EXPLODE INTO

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
MONEY, ONE WHERE HE RUNS AFTER

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
AN AMBULANCE LIKE A CAROUSEL

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
HORSE, ONLY TO GET HIT BY A

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
DIFFERENT AMBULANCE.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
AND THEN THERE'S THIS:

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
>> GIVE ME MY LUNCH MONEY BACK!

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
WHERE'S THE ALABAMA HAMMER?

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
>> I'VE BEEN STANDING UP TO

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
BULLIES MY WHOLE LIFE.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
>> WHOO!

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
>> WHOO!

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
I'M MIKE SLOCUMB, THE ALABAMA

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
HAMMER!

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
IF YOU'VE BEEN INJURED IN A CAR

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
WRECK, DON'T LET THE INSURANCE

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
COMPANY BULLY YOU.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
CALL ME RIGHT NOW!

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
>> John: WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?

29:20.000 --> 29:20.000
I'M REALLY CURIOUS WHAT HAPPENED

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
IN THE NEXT SCENE WHEN THE

29:21.000 --> 29:21.000
POLICE TURNED UP.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
"WHO PUNCHED THIS CHILD

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
UNCONSCIOUS?"

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
"THAT WAS ME, OFFICER, BUT DON'T

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
WORRY -- IT'S OKAY."

29:26.000 --> 29:26.000
"EXPLAIN HOW, BUT JUST SO YOU

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
KNOW, I'M GOING TO GET MY TASER

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
OUT WHILE YOU TALK."

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
"WHEN I KNOCKED HIM OUT, I WAS

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
ALSO A CHILD.

29:34.000 --> 29:34.000
THEN I SAID 'WHOO,' IMMEDIATELY

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
AGED 30 YEARS INTO AN ADULT, AND

29:37.000 --> 29:37.000
SAID 'WHOO' AGAIN."

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
"HMM.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
SEEMS UNLIKELY, BUT YOU ARE

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
WHITE, SO I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND

29:40.000 --> 29:40.000
GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF THE

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
DOUBT."

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
LOOK, IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR TO

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
ME THAT MIKE SLOCUMB RIPPED OFF

29:45.000 --> 29:45.000
THE TEXAS HAMMER. AND YOU CAN SEE WHY.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
HIS COMMERCIALS ARE EVERYTHING

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
THAT SLOCUMB'S AREN'T: CLEAR,

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
PRECISE, AND THEMATICALLY

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
RESONANT.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
YOU'LL LEARN TWO KEY FACTS: HE'S

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
THE TEXAS HAMMER, AND THAT'S IT.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
AND I SO BADLY DON'T WANT THESE

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
TWO GLORIOUS MANIACS TO FIGHT.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
IT SEEMS THE BEST THING IS FOR

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
MIKE SLOCUMB TO SIMPLY GET A

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
DIFFERENT TOOL-THEMED NICKNAME

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
SO THESE TWO DANGEROUSLY STRANGE

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
MEN CAN MOVE ON IN PEACE.

30:06.000 --> 30:11.000
AND I ACTUALLY HAVE A SUGGESTION

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
FOR YOU, MIKE, AND IT'S THIS

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
BANANA SLICER.

30:14.000 --> 30:14.000
MIKE "THE ALABAMA BANANA SLICER"

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
SLOCUMB.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
THINK ABOUT IT -- IT WORKS

30:16.000 --> 30:16.000
PERFECTLY.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
JUST LIKE A HAMMER, IT'S A TOOL.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
AND LIKE YOUR COMMERCIALS, IT'S

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
UNNECESSARY, COMPLICATED, AND I

30:19.000 --> 30:24.000
DON'T LIKE LOOKING AT IT.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
SO PLEASE, MIKE, TAKE THIS IDEA,

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
AND TAKE THIS BANANA SLICER TOO.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
AND THAT'S IT!

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
THAT'S OUR SHOW!

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
DURING THIS VERY WEIRD TIME.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
THANK YOU TO OUR STAFF

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
FOR WORKING SO HARD IN THIS VERY

30:38.000 --> 30:38.000
DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
WE'LL BE OFF FOR A COUPLE OF

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
WEEKS NOW.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
BUT WE WILL BE BACK

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
SEPTEMBER 12TH, DEFINITELY IN A

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
STUDIO, MAYBE WITH AN AUDIENCE,

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
MAYBE NOT.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
WHO KNOWS?

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
BUT THE POINT IS, THAT'S IT!

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
>> THAT'S IT?

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
LIKE...

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
YOU'RE ENDING IT?

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
>> John: YEAH.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
THAT'S IT.

30:57.000 --> 30:57.000
THIS IS WHERE YOU AND I SAY

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
GOODBYE.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
>> YOU KNOW, IT IS OUR LAST

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
NIGHT TOGETHER, RIGHT?

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
SO YOU DIDN'T PLAN ANYTHING?

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
>> John: UM...

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
>> CONAN GOT A SONG, REMEMBER?

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
JACK BLACK SANG A BIG SONG.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
>> John: RIGHT, SORRY, DO YOU

31:11.000 --> 31:11.000
THINK YOU'RE THE CONAN IN THIS

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
DYNAMIC?

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
>> I JUST THOUGHT YOU'D PREPARE

31:13.000 --> 31:13.000
SOMETHING.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA -- YEAH --

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
YOU KNOW -- YOU'RE DOING IN YOUR

31:15.000 --> 31:15.000
WAY.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
THAT'S FINE.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
BYE.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
>> John: ALL RIGHT, UM,

31:20.000 --> 31:20.000
ARE YOU SURE?

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
>> YEAH, I SAID I'M FINE.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
SO WE'RE DONE.

31:22.000 --> 31:22.000
GOODBYE.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
AND DEFINITELY NO SONG.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
>> John: OKAY, WELL, THANKS FOR

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
EVERYTHING AND I GUESS, UM, I'LL

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
SEE YOU AROUND.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
UM...

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
