WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:08.975 --> 00:13.413
Six years ago, the Geordie Squad
first got together.

00:14.748 --> 00:16.850
(cheering)

00:16.916 --> 00:18.818
But it's not all been one big party.

00:18.885 --> 00:20.820
Back to work.

00:20.887 --> 00:23.556
We had to work
for that wrinkly fuck Anna.

00:24.824 --> 00:27.894
But we fucking nailed it.

00:27.961 --> 00:30.430
# Any cock's good
When it's cock, cock, cock #

00:32.399 --> 00:35.368
We've only gone and made
her business a global success.

00:36.569 --> 00:39.773
So, now the squad is expanding.

00:39.839 --> 00:42.976
Oi, oi!
Hello! Hiya!

00:43.042 --> 00:45.245
Cheers!
(cheering)

00:50.550 --> 00:54.421
I'm not gonna be able to
keep yous all on full time.

00:54.487 --> 00:59.159
We need to help Anna decide
who stays and who goes.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.696
The only thing
we give a shit about is...

01:03.763 --> 01:06.466
Are they fucking radge enough...

01:06.533 --> 01:09.235
To join this crazy family?

01:15.275 --> 01:17.677
Let wuh fuckin gan.

01:17.744 --> 01:22.549
So far Anna has sent in Abbie, Eve,
Billy, Sarah, Zahida and Elettra.

01:22.615 --> 01:23.616
Oh, shit!

01:23.683 --> 01:26.186
I can only describe
this thing as an angel.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.188
Where ya from?
Italy. Ciao.

01:28.254 --> 01:32.158
English might not be her language,
but she makes more sense than Chloe.

01:33.726 --> 01:36.763
I haven't spoke to Marty
since I've been back in the house.

01:39.866 --> 01:43.069
I love Aaron to bits
and I'll always care about him.

01:43.136 --> 01:44.971
It's giving us a little twinge.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.275
I literally can't stand Martin.

01:51.811 --> 01:55.682
Oh, Martin!
That boy is not good for me.

01:55.748 --> 01:57.584
Everyone's sick of your shit!

01:57.650 --> 02:00.119
Chloe's just had me
in front of everyone!

02:00.186 --> 02:02.255
Fuck off, Martin. Fuck off!

02:02.322 --> 02:04.290
This is a disaster.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.294
I should have a degree in pulling.

02:09.362 --> 02:11.664
Never kiss anyone with no six-pack.

02:11.731 --> 02:14.367
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:14.434 --> 02:16.803
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.938
I'm preened to perfection.

02:19.005 --> 02:21.341
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:21.407 --> 02:24.177
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:24.244 --> 02:27.146
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:27.213 --> 02:30.717
Me quiff's pure lethal
and me banter's pure naughty.

02:30.783 --> 02:32.785
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:51.638 --> 02:52.639
Another level.

02:52.705 --> 02:55.241
I woke up this morning
and I feel pure mint,

02:55.308 --> 02:58.811
last night I had Marty's life
and everyone was on my side.

02:58.878 --> 03:00.813
You did it so good,
you held your own.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.249
You weren't violent
and it was mature of you.

03:03.316 --> 03:06.419
And what you were saying was right.
Bang on, wasn't it?

03:06.486 --> 03:09.489
I'm so proud of Chloe.
She's a changed woman.

03:09.556 --> 03:13.259
She finally got the bottle to tell
Marty exactly what he's done to her,

03:13.326 --> 03:16.162
how much he hurt her
and you could see she'd had enough.

03:16.229 --> 03:18.197
You know where she needs to go?
Where?

03:18.264 --> 03:19.566
I hope Anna puts a boy in.

03:19.632 --> 03:23.469
Hopefully Anna is gonna send in
a really fit good-looking lad

03:23.536 --> 03:26.839
that Chloe can ride
like a white stallion.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.743
Nathan. Look at this spot on me bum.

03:30.810 --> 03:32.178
Bad?

03:32.245 --> 03:33.646
Nah.

03:33.713 --> 03:36.149
(laughter)

03:38.184 --> 03:39.953
(yawns)

03:42.388 --> 03:43.723
(mimics explosion)

03:44.891 --> 03:48.027
I need to fill the lads in
exactly what happened last night.

03:48.094 --> 03:51.898
I kissed Elettra, then Chloe walked
in and shit went fucking west.

03:51.965 --> 03:55.268
All I wanna do is move on
and I want Chloe to do the same.

03:55.335 --> 03:58.504
Oh, God.
She went fucking berserk, man.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.540
Actually, it makes us feel upset.

04:00.607 --> 04:02.575
It was gonna bite you in the arse.

04:02.642 --> 04:04.577
Marty brings all this on himself.

04:04.644 --> 04:06.946
He tells Chloe
he won't kiss any more girls,

04:07.013 --> 04:08.481
then necks on with Elettra.

04:08.548 --> 04:11.484
Marty, I'd love to
stick up for ya, but I can't!

04:11.551 --> 04:13.720
Another night, no shagging, boys.

04:13.786 --> 04:17.123
If Marnie wasn't here, I reckon
you would have pulled by now.

04:17.190 --> 04:19.826
As much as I would like
to have sex in that shag pad,

04:19.892 --> 04:21.461
I do still care about Marnie,

04:21.527 --> 04:23.997
so I'm not gonna pull girls
in front of her face.

04:24.063 --> 04:25.632
I'm too soft, me, aren't I?

04:35.575 --> 04:37.677
See you later, lads.
(all) Bye!

04:37.744 --> 04:41.147
Me, Sophie and Chloe decided
to take the newbies for breakfast.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.049
It's been a rocky start with us lot,

04:43.116 --> 04:45.218
so I want to get to know them
a bit better.

04:45.284 --> 04:46.653
I'm absolutely hanging.

04:46.719 --> 04:49.422
I wanna get out in me jamas
and have some scran.

04:49.489 --> 04:50.623
Enjoy, Billy.

04:51.591 --> 04:54.494
The girls asked us to go,
but they're in their pyjamas.

04:54.560 --> 04:58.264
I hope nobody sees us. I've got
a reputation to keep round here.

04:58.331 --> 05:00.566
Take your hat off.
Let me see your hair.

05:00.633 --> 05:04.003
You look like one of them
little trolls. So cute.

05:04.070 --> 05:06.139
Nathan wants to hang out
with the boys.

05:06.205 --> 05:10.109
Let's take you for a haircut,
because your hair is fucking shite.

05:10.176 --> 05:12.812
Let's go get sharpened up.

05:21.521 --> 05:23.823
I'm having such a wicked time
with this lot.

05:23.890 --> 05:25.758
I never want this experience to end.

05:25.825 --> 05:28.327
Elettra,
this is mince and dumplings.

05:28.394 --> 05:29.729
Mince and dumplings.

05:29.796 --> 05:34.200
I don't know what this is.
It's like a poo in a plate.

05:34.267 --> 05:35.935
I don't want to eat it.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.070
(laughter)

05:40.773 --> 05:41.974
Hiya.

05:42.041 --> 05:45.411
We just got to the barbers, cos
we need to look sick for tonight.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.181
What do you reckon, Tom? Platinum?

05:48.247 --> 05:50.216
Just get the "I wanna shag" haircut.

05:50.283 --> 05:52.652
I've decided I need
to change me hair colour,

05:52.719 --> 05:55.788
and even though the gadgie
that runs this place has told us

05:55.855 --> 05:59.058
the colour I want is gonna be shite,
I'm gonna do it anyway.

05:59.125 --> 06:01.728
I'm the biggest radgie
in these ends.

06:04.964 --> 06:05.998
Did she? When?

06:06.065 --> 06:09.001
This is the perfect time to take
the piss out of Marty.

06:12.238 --> 06:15.408
He's came here
and dyed his whole hair blonde.

06:15.475 --> 06:18.544
Just after I necked on
with her as well.

06:25.485 --> 06:28.421
We've came out in our onesies.
We're tramps, aren't we?

06:28.488 --> 06:30.256
(laughter)

06:30.323 --> 06:34.494
It's nice for the originals to take
us to breakfast this morning.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.163
Especially after Chloe's
kick off with Marty.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.565
After last night,
there's a new Chloe.

06:39.632 --> 06:42.568
Oh yeah!
Everyone knows what he's like now.

06:42.635 --> 06:44.971
A liar, two-faced,
likes to cause trouble.

06:45.037 --> 06:48.007
(Billy) Awkward.
The girls are going in on Marty.

06:48.074 --> 06:51.377
I don't have a problem with the kid,
so I'm gonna keep out of it.

06:51.444 --> 06:54.247
Nobody likes Martin.
OK. I understand.

06:54.313 --> 06:55.815
We all hate him.

06:55.882 --> 06:58.785
I don't understand why
they are angry with Marty.

06:58.851 --> 07:00.853
So, Chloe is not his girlfriend

07:00.920 --> 07:04.524
and honestly he kiss me
because I'm so beautiful.

07:04.590 --> 07:10.062
I'm a good friend. If you tell me,
"I like Marty", I never do this.

07:10.129 --> 07:13.699
You can get with him. He's not my
property. I'd never tell you not to.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.202
I've heard her say
she's over him 1000 times,

07:16.269 --> 07:18.271
but we'll have to wait and see.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.209
The newbies did well last night.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.878
I like it when they do work for us,
cos we get drunk.

07:25.945 --> 07:29.182
(Nathan) Anna sending these new
workers in is a blessing.

07:29.248 --> 07:30.917
Cos we don't have to do any work.

07:30.983 --> 07:33.820
She might be looking
for hard workers, but we're not.

07:33.886 --> 07:36.189
We want someone who
fits in with the family.

07:36.255 --> 07:40.960
I think now Sarah and Abbie
creeped above Zahida.

07:41.027 --> 07:45.965
Sarah and Abbie are both funny as
fuck and know how to party hard.

07:46.032 --> 07:47.366
If they can keep this up,

07:47.433 --> 07:50.736
I can see them two being
a wicked addition to this family.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.639
It's a proper competition.
It is, aye.

07:53.706 --> 07:56.576
Billy's just fucking...
(laughs) Billy's...

07:56.642 --> 07:58.144
Fuck knows what he's doing.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.046
I think this is a good little group.

08:00.112 --> 08:03.649
At the same time, we don't know
how many workers Anna is putting in.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.485
Nathan, get that silver fox done.

08:06.552 --> 08:09.055
Go on, Nathan! Go on, son.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.826
What about tonight, we get ready...

08:13.893 --> 08:16.329
Billy, get a bit of
eyebrow pencil on you.

08:16.395 --> 08:17.463
(laughter)

08:17.530 --> 08:21.067
I've loved having breakfast.
I've got to know them better.

08:21.133 --> 08:24.103
And I think we're all
getting along so good now.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.805
I've just farted.
Have you?

08:25.872 --> 08:28.608
Oh, I don't want that...
I can smell that, mind.

08:28.674 --> 08:29.709
Eggy.

08:29.775 --> 08:33.346
I have thoroughly enjoyed this
greasy sausage, but I need a shit,

08:33.412 --> 08:35.548
so it's time to get home pronto.

08:46.559 --> 08:48.160
My hair's fucking red, man!

08:48.227 --> 08:50.129
(laughter)

08:51.130 --> 08:53.966
I've picked
the worst colour possible.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.469
Oh, nah, I can't believe this.

08:56.535 --> 08:59.839
Marty, bit of advice. Next time
you come to the hairdresser's,

08:59.906 --> 09:01.140
bring your glasses,

09:01.207 --> 09:05.077
so you can see what colour
you're getting your hair dyed.

09:05.144 --> 09:08.414
Fuck me, it's reddy-purple, radge.

09:08.481 --> 09:10.283
How am I meant to pull Elettra now?

09:10.349 --> 09:12.785
I shoulda listened
to the bastard barber.

09:12.852 --> 09:14.186
Ready?
Yeah.

09:14.253 --> 09:15.321
Spot on.

09:16.322 --> 09:19.258
I'm not gonna lie,
I can't wait for the girls to see

09:19.325 --> 09:21.928
what Marty has done
to his fucking hair.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.602
(screams)

09:29.669 --> 09:31.671
laughter)

09:38.311 --> 09:41.013
I wonder what the boys
have been doing.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.915
Been gone about ten hours!

09:44.884 --> 09:47.520
I'm gonna just walk into the house
with me hat on

09:47.586 --> 09:49.288
and keep myself fucking quiet.

09:49.355 --> 09:52.658
Hopefully no-one will realise
what's happened.

09:52.725 --> 09:54.560
Ey!
Where ya been?

09:54.627 --> 09:56.362
Hey, look at Gaz.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.065
You look like a proper chava.

09:59.131 --> 10:02.168
Martin's got a hat on!
My hair's fucked, man. It's purple!

10:02.234 --> 10:04.203
Oh, my God!

10:04.270 --> 10:06.939
Whoa, what the fuck has happened
to Marty's hair?

10:07.006 --> 10:10.009
He acts like a knob and now
he even fucking looks like one!

10:10.076 --> 10:11.877
I'm fucking devastated.

10:11.944 --> 10:15.414
You know what this is?
Karma, pink karma.

10:15.481 --> 10:16.983
(laughter)

10:17.049 --> 10:20.720
I don't care what people say.
I like Marty, I fancy him.

10:20.786 --> 10:23.322
This is want to make me kiss more.

10:23.389 --> 10:25.624
Elettra's laughing. Fuck's sake.

10:29.595 --> 10:30.997
I just heard a car.

10:31.063 --> 10:33.466
I'm having the time of me life
watching Marty

10:33.532 --> 10:36.702
under that ridiculously pink hair,
then I hear a car pull up.

10:36.769 --> 10:38.471
Is it a newbie, or is it Anna?

10:41.407 --> 10:44.210
Oh, my God, there's a suitcase.

10:44.276 --> 10:47.880
The door opens and I just hope
it's someone that can rewind time

10:47.947 --> 10:49.982
and fix me fucking hair.

10:50.049 --> 10:51.751
(all cheer)

10:52.752 --> 10:54.453
A new boy's just walked in!

10:54.520 --> 10:56.222
What the hell!

10:56.288 --> 10:59.658
Sam is single
and I fancy your fucking Pringle.

10:59.725 --> 11:01.627
Marnie is dancing all over us.

11:01.694 --> 11:04.196
Aaron, stay away from your ex.

11:05.865 --> 11:07.099
I'm not having that.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.568
Why do you care
that he disrespected me?

11:09.635 --> 11:11.270
Fuck me!

11:12.071 --> 11:14.073
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

11:17.009 --> 11:17.209
.

11:19.712 --> 11:19.912
.

11:28.454 --> 11:31.157
Oh, my God, there's a suitcase.

11:31.223 --> 11:34.660
The door opens and I just hope
it's someone that can rewind time

11:34.727 --> 11:36.228
and fix me fucking hair.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.831
Oi! Ha, ha!

11:41.600 --> 11:43.369
(cheering)

11:43.436 --> 11:46.405
A new boy's just walked in!
What the hell?!

11:47.807 --> 11:50.810
I'm Sam, I'm 24, I'm keen, I'm lean.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.945
I'm the Prince Charming
of Newcastle.

11:53.012 --> 11:54.280
You all right?

11:54.346 --> 11:57.516
It's another boy! Team sausage!

11:57.583 --> 11:59.885
Sam, tell us a bit about yourself.

11:59.952 --> 12:01.987
I'm a barber, I'm pretty good at it.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.957
Sam's a barber.
This is fucking perfect.

12:05.024 --> 12:07.226
I'm a party animal.
Bit of a show off. Woo!

12:07.293 --> 12:09.628
Love the attention.
I'm a bit of a pretty boy.

12:09.695 --> 12:10.696
(laughter)

12:10.763 --> 12:13.065
Sam belts through the door,
full of energy.

12:13.132 --> 12:14.767
He's got loads of confidence.

12:14.834 --> 12:18.404
I think he is going to be a very
good lad to have in this house.

12:18.471 --> 12:21.207
I have a question for the girls.
Are you single?

12:21.273 --> 12:22.908
Single, seven years strong.

12:22.975 --> 12:25.978
Woo! Sam is sexy and single.

12:26.045 --> 12:28.881
Ooh! What was that?
I just felt me fanny flutter?

12:28.948 --> 12:32.418
Sam, not everyone is going to make
the cut, so you have to impress.

12:32.485 --> 12:35.721
As soon as I walk in, they're
telling us that I need to impress,

12:35.788 --> 12:39.125
but I'm not bothered. I'm more
interested in the fit birds.

12:39.191 --> 12:41.494
I'm looking at Chloe
and she's looking hot.

12:41.560 --> 12:44.063
Good job you're a barber.
Look at Marty's hair!

12:44.130 --> 12:45.664
(laughter)

12:45.731 --> 12:48.300
Sam, get upstairs
and sort my hair out!

12:48.367 --> 12:49.902
Lovely, go on!

12:49.969 --> 12:52.004
I need to get in the shower.
I stink!

12:52.071 --> 12:56.976
Get your hair washed, Chloe!
(cheering, screaming)

13:12.124 --> 13:14.560
I'm trying to get me words out
and I'm going...

13:14.627 --> 13:18.497
I'm excited for tonight cos Sam's
here and I want him to fancy us.

13:18.564 --> 13:21.567
I can't tell you how happy I am
there's a new boy in here.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.402
I'm attracted to Sam. I fancy him.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.437
Sam is a breath of fresh air.

13:25.504 --> 13:29.942
Chloe fancies Sam. This is
the perfect way to get over Marty.

13:30.009 --> 13:31.010
For good!

13:33.145 --> 13:36.482
I don't want to talk to him.
I feel like I'm starting to move on.

13:36.549 --> 13:39.285
Tonight I do not give a fuck
about Elettra and Marty.

13:39.351 --> 13:42.221
It's all about me
and maybe even a bit of Sam.

13:42.288 --> 13:45.357
I'm not shagging. I'll neck on.
Maybe get one finger.

13:45.424 --> 13:46.859
Or two!
Yeah, two.

13:46.926 --> 13:49.628
Two's good, two's like a dick girth.

13:52.965 --> 13:54.934
I reckon once I've styled it and...

13:55.000 --> 13:58.604
I've just got here and Marty's
asking us to sort out his hair.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.773
I'm a barber, not a miracle worker.

14:00.839 --> 14:03.142
But it's a good chance
to bond with the lads!

14:03.209 --> 14:06.979
Sam, on walking in, any birds
that caught your eye straightaway?

14:07.046 --> 14:10.649
I been eyeing a couple of 'em.
Chloe's looking all right, i'nt she?

14:11.750 --> 14:13.319
Crack on.

14:13.385 --> 14:15.387
Go for it, but treat her well.

14:15.454 --> 14:17.890
Even though we've been
through loads of shit,

14:17.957 --> 14:19.525
she's one of me best mates.

14:19.592 --> 14:22.861
You know what, I'm gonna make sure
I'm having a good time.

14:22.928 --> 14:25.130
If it happens, it happens.
Lovely!

14:25.197 --> 14:26.565
I know me shit, mate.

14:31.804 --> 14:35.241
You have piercings?
What is this?

14:35.307 --> 14:38.944
Clitty-clitty.
I have 32 piercings.

14:39.011 --> 14:40.946
My favourite is my...

14:42.514 --> 14:44.450
(laughs)

14:44.516 --> 14:47.286
Everybody is looking sick.

14:47.353 --> 14:50.489
I wanna get to the club
and see if Sam can party.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.425
Let's fucking get to the club
and get pissed. Let's go!

15:04.870 --> 15:08.173
We get to the club
and I cannot wait to boogie on down!

15:08.240 --> 15:09.241
In a classy way.

15:17.082 --> 15:18.751
(cheering)

15:21.520 --> 15:23.589
Tonight is gonna be fucking wicked!

15:23.656 --> 15:27.426
Obviously I still care about Marnie,
but to be honest, I'm horny as fuck

15:27.493 --> 15:29.295
and there's fit girls everywhere

15:29.361 --> 15:32.665
so hopefully I can crack on
and Marnie won't see anything.

15:35.401 --> 15:36.902
Fucking buzzing.

15:36.969 --> 15:38.337
It's Sam's first night.

15:38.404 --> 15:41.206
All we need to do is get fucked
and have a good night.

15:48.847 --> 15:51.950
Chloe fancies Sam.
We wanna find out if he fancies her.

16:02.194 --> 16:05.964
Buzzing. Sophie and Nathan have said
that I should crack on with Chloe.

16:06.031 --> 16:09.201
If they think I should go for it,
I must have a chance.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.621
Sam is Chloe's type,

16:29.688 --> 16:33.959
so hopefully she can get over Marty
and get under Sam.

16:38.964 --> 16:42.968
Sam's single and ready to mingle
and I fancy your fucking Pringle.

16:53.278 --> 16:56.648
Chloe comes over and I'm not
gonna lie, she's looking fit.

16:56.715 --> 16:58.817
So, I'm not gonna waste any time.

16:58.884 --> 17:02.554
Watch out, Chloe. You're about to
experience Sam's special move.

17:07.393 --> 17:10.762
I kissed the new boy!
I kissed the new boy!

17:15.134 --> 17:18.203
I'm buzzing for her.
Marty, I hope you're watching.

17:23.709 --> 17:27.646
Fuck me. Sam doesn't fuck about,
does he? This is perfect.

17:27.713 --> 17:31.283
Now I can crack on with Elettra
without Chloe saying one word.

17:32.785 --> 17:36.088
As soon as Chloe kisses Sam,
Marty kisses Elettra.

17:36.155 --> 17:39.057
I've never seen something
so pathetic in all my life.

17:39.124 --> 17:41.760
Chloe's moved on, Marty.
Get over it!

17:44.730 --> 17:48.867
I like Marty and I want
to kiss him all night.

17:55.374 --> 17:57.576
Just cos me and Aaron
used to be a couple,

17:57.643 --> 17:59.645
doesn't mean it's got to be awkward.

17:59.711 --> 18:03.215
I do have a boyfriend, but I still
wanna have fun with Aaron.

18:06.652 --> 18:09.421
Marnie is mortal.
She's dancing all over us.

18:09.488 --> 18:12.191
I wanna go on the pull,
but she's making it hard.

18:17.029 --> 18:18.464
Aaron, if you wanna pull,

18:18.530 --> 18:21.667
it might be a good idea
to stay away from your ex!

18:21.733 --> 18:23.202
Why are you with Marnie?!

18:32.077 --> 18:33.645
Tonight has been a belter.

18:33.712 --> 18:35.848
Seems everyone
has let their hair down.

18:35.914 --> 18:38.450
Everyone is absolutely smashed.

18:41.987 --> 18:45.624
Me and Chloe are bouncing off each
other and having a wicked night.

18:45.691 --> 18:49.294
And I'm definitely gonna see if I
can get her in that shag pad later.

18:52.531 --> 18:55.267
Tonight's been wicked.
Let's get back to the house,

18:55.334 --> 18:59.271
carry on the fun and hopefully
someone will get in that shag pad.

19:11.149 --> 19:12.551
It's gonna go on the floor!

19:13.719 --> 19:15.287
We get back to the house.

19:15.354 --> 19:18.524
Tonight's been a good night.
I doubt I'll remember.

19:18.590 --> 19:21.560
I'm so drunk I feel like
I need to get myself to bed.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.335
Boosh. Boosh.

19:32.571 --> 19:35.741
Out of date. It's out of date.
Why you drinking it for?

19:35.807 --> 19:38.176
My first night
has been fucking mint.

19:38.243 --> 19:41.246
I'm getting on with everybody
and I necked on with Chloe.

19:41.313 --> 19:42.681
My night's not over yet.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.918
Shall we go chill
in that other spare room?

19:45.984 --> 19:48.186
No, we're not!
Ah, we're not?

19:50.722 --> 19:52.558
That's fine. Do what you want.

19:52.624 --> 19:55.627
Sam needs to realise if he wants
to get us in the shag pad,

19:55.694 --> 19:57.329
he needs to graft a lot harder.

19:57.396 --> 19:59.131
Don't disrespect her like that.

19:59.197 --> 20:01.667
Been here ten minutes.
I'm not being funny.

20:01.733 --> 20:03.936
Wait there,
I can stick up for myself.

20:04.002 --> 20:06.038
Why would you care
he disrespected me?

20:06.104 --> 20:07.739
Why the fuck wouldn't I?

20:07.806 --> 20:10.809
I dunno why Marty's so arsed
about me getting with Chloe.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.812
You were the one encouraging me
to get with her earlier.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.982
That lad just tried to lie to you
there and I stood up for ya!

20:17.049 --> 20:18.650
Fuck me!

20:18.717 --> 20:20.419
All I'm trying to do for you

20:20.485 --> 20:23.388
is stick up for you when a lad
is talking to ya like shit.

20:23.455 --> 20:26.124
All she's doing is throwing it
back in me face.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.762
What a dick.
What is wrong with Marty?

20:30.829 --> 20:33.098
Every time I get with a lad,
he ruins it.

20:33.165 --> 20:36.802
He doesn't wanna be with us but he
doesn't want anyone else to have us.

20:36.868 --> 20:39.037
Why can't he just let me move on?

20:48.680 --> 20:51.249
It's a bar crawl.
Nathan, me and you are leading.

20:51.316 --> 20:53.418
No, why me?!

20:53.485 --> 20:55.287
(cheering)

20:55.354 --> 20:57.623
The girl can fucking move.

20:57.689 --> 21:00.225
Let the expert through.

21:00.292 --> 21:02.227
We're figuring out who we like.

21:02.294 --> 21:04.696
Eve and Billy are very, very quiet.

21:04.763 --> 21:08.333
When I see Elettra,
come for cuddles, Babycakes. Boom!

21:09.134 --> 21:11.136
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

21:14.473 --> 21:14.673
.

21:17.209 --> 21:17.409
.

21:35.761 --> 21:38.196
Marty, man, you've got a semi on.
I haven't.

21:38.263 --> 21:41.366
You have! Marty's got a semi on!

21:41.433 --> 21:44.069
Last night, Aaron
spent his night with Marnie

21:44.136 --> 21:45.937
and Marty and Chloe argued again.

21:46.004 --> 21:48.874
Boys, if yous wanna bang,
you have to change your ways.

21:53.145 --> 21:57.049
Last night was wicked but Marnie was
dancing all over us being flirty.

21:57.115 --> 22:00.318
I don't know what's going on
in her head, but I'm confused.

22:02.287 --> 22:05.290
I tried to stick up for her
when Sam tried to mug her off.

22:05.357 --> 22:08.627
I want to look after her, but
I don't want to be her boyfriend.

22:08.694 --> 22:09.928
I want to be her mate.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.364
What's difficult
to understand about that?

22:12.431 --> 22:14.933
You do your thing, let her do hers.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.201
Just let them crack on!

22:16.268 --> 22:20.105
Marty, you're cracking on
with other people, so let it happen.

22:20.172 --> 22:23.208
He doesn't want her but
he doesn't want her to have anyone.

22:23.275 --> 22:24.976
He loves attention being on him.

22:25.043 --> 22:27.746
I think I say things
and I mean something else.

22:27.813 --> 22:30.682
Like, "I want my hair silver"
and getting it red?

22:30.749 --> 22:33.051
(laughter)

22:35.654 --> 22:38.757
Morning, everybody.
How are yous feeling?

22:38.824 --> 22:41.626
Tired.
What happened last night?

22:41.693 --> 22:44.062
Last night, me and Sam necked on,

22:44.129 --> 22:47.165
but he was a knob when I didn't go
to the shag pad with him.

22:47.232 --> 22:49.668
What a surprise,
all lads are the same.

22:49.735 --> 22:51.603
But why did Marty stand up for us?!

22:51.670 --> 22:52.704
What's going on?!

22:52.771 --> 22:54.139
He's such a head fuck.

22:54.206 --> 22:57.175
I think it does help
that you do have Sam here

22:57.242 --> 23:00.445
to keep your head, like,
occupied with him.

23:00.512 --> 23:03.448
Martin's a twat. Chloe's been
doing so well in the house

23:03.515 --> 23:06.218
and he can't stand
that she's over him.

23:06.284 --> 23:08.286
She needs to keep
well away from him.

23:08.353 --> 23:09.921
Nathan!

23:09.988 --> 23:12.023
Don't do that.
I will.

23:12.090 --> 23:16.628
I can barely speak, let alone listen
to the shit they're talking about.

23:16.695 --> 23:19.364
I hope to God
Anna doesn't send me to work.

23:21.199 --> 23:22.200
Why?

23:24.369 --> 23:26.571
Well, self-inflicted, kid.

23:31.443 --> 23:33.278
You like it?
Like what?

23:33.345 --> 23:35.547
Chloe.
I like all girls.

23:35.614 --> 23:39.785
All the girls here.
Very open-minded to women here.

23:39.851 --> 23:42.020
Even though Marty
got a bit upset with us,

23:42.087 --> 23:44.923
I am a social chameleon
and I blended straight in.

23:44.990 --> 23:47.826
I had a wicked first night
and got on with everyone.

23:47.893 --> 23:51.296
What happened last night
with Martin? Where is that going?

23:51.363 --> 23:53.298
He is a beautiful boy...
Yeah.

23:53.365 --> 23:54.566
...but I don't know.

23:54.633 --> 23:57.169
Is Martin not moving
to Italy anytime soon?

23:57.235 --> 23:58.703
No.
No.

23:58.770 --> 24:02.340
Elettra is fit. But it's like
talking to an Italian brick wall.

24:02.407 --> 24:04.409
Kisses with me?

24:04.476 --> 24:05.477
(scoffs)
No?

24:05.544 --> 24:08.547
People like you,
I eat for my breakfast.

24:08.613 --> 24:10.682
(laughs)

24:18.757 --> 24:21.126
(phone rings)

24:22.694 --> 24:25.463
The sound of that phone
is making me feel sick.

24:25.530 --> 24:28.767
It's probably Anna and I'm hoping
that I don't have work.

24:28.834 --> 24:31.069
Hello?
"Hiya, Chloe. How are you?"

24:31.136 --> 24:33.772
Hi, Anna.
"I've got an important job today."

24:33.839 --> 24:35.240
"It's a bar crawl."
Yeah.

24:35.307 --> 24:38.210
"You and Nathan will be taking
all the new workers..."

24:38.276 --> 24:41.546
Right.
"...to put them through their paces."

24:41.613 --> 24:44.482
Me and Nathan are taking
all the newbies on a bar crawl.

24:44.549 --> 24:46.484
I'm fucking buzzing. Free peeve!

24:46.551 --> 24:49.454
"You'll all need costumes
and they'll arrive soon."

24:49.521 --> 24:52.424
"Just make sure
that nobody lets me down

24:52.490 --> 24:55.093
and I want to meet yous lot
tonight for a catch up."

24:55.160 --> 24:57.596
OK, bye! Bye. Bye.

24:58.563 --> 25:01.399
So, everyone, it's a bar crawl

25:01.466 --> 25:03.735
and me and you, Nathan,
are leading it.

25:05.837 --> 25:10.041
No, no, no! Why me?!

25:10.108 --> 25:13.144
Nathan's in a bad way.

25:13.211 --> 25:17.382
Newbies, it's a very big job
and we need to report back to her.

25:17.449 --> 25:19.851
And we need to meet her
at 7.00pm tonight.

25:19.918 --> 25:23.855
The fact that these lot consider
a bar crawl work is fucking amazing.

25:23.922 --> 25:27.158
Let's get this party started,
cos I want to prove myself.

25:27.225 --> 25:30.328
Nathan, if you're not fit enough
to be here then fuck off!

25:30.395 --> 25:32.864
You're meant to lead by example,
not cry!

25:32.931 --> 25:36.701
I feel sorry for Nathan but he needs
to man up and get back on the piss.

25:36.768 --> 25:38.970
We need to know
what these workers are like

25:39.037 --> 25:41.606
so we can feed it
back to Anna later.

25:49.714 --> 25:53.418
Anna has given us golf costumes
to wear. What's she playing at?

25:53.485 --> 25:56.354
I'm never gonna get a hole in one
dressed like this.

25:58.924 --> 26:00.926
Getting ready is a struggle

26:00.992 --> 26:03.762
and to top it off,
we've got to wear stupid outfits.

26:03.828 --> 26:08.533
These newbies best be ready to work
cos I'm doing fuck all today.

26:08.600 --> 26:11.736
I thought the outfits were gonna
look shit, they look good.

26:11.803 --> 26:14.706
I've pulled myself together
and I'm excited for this.

26:14.773 --> 26:18.276
Seeing Nathan drag himself to work
makes me realise

26:18.343 --> 26:20.545
what it takes
to be part of this family.

26:20.612 --> 26:23.081
I need to show them
how radge I can be today.

26:29.187 --> 26:30.855
Hi, everybody!

26:30.922 --> 26:31.923
(cheering)

26:31.990 --> 26:33.758
Today's work is a bar crawl,

26:33.825 --> 26:39.364
so all Elettra, Billy, Eve,
Abbie, Sam, Sarah and Zahida

26:39.431 --> 26:44.135
need to do is get the clients
having fun and getting pissed. Easy.

26:44.202 --> 26:48.907
Right, yous, listen, in this bar
it's Sam, Eve and Abbie.

26:48.974 --> 26:51.343
Get over there, get the drinks out.
Fuck off.

26:51.409 --> 26:53.845
Yous, get over here.
Go on!

26:53.912 --> 26:56.481
We'll have a few drinks,
drinking games.

26:56.548 --> 27:00.118
I'm gonna show them a good time.
Three, two, one, go!

27:00.185 --> 27:04.689
(cheering, shouting)

27:04.756 --> 27:08.526
Eve, she's not been the best, so now
would be the perfect time to step up.

27:08.593 --> 27:13.665
(cheering, shouting)

27:13.732 --> 27:17.769
The wheelbarrow game went so well
but that was just a starter.

27:17.836 --> 27:20.171
Now it's time to get on the shots.

27:20.238 --> 27:21.573
Are we drunk yet?

27:21.639 --> 27:23.808
(cheering, shouting)

27:23.875 --> 27:25.543
Drinks.

27:25.610 --> 27:30.415
Overall, the first group did OK,
but all the punters now are mortal,

27:30.482 --> 27:33.051
so the second group
are going to find it hard.

27:33.118 --> 27:34.185
Sucks to be you!

27:34.252 --> 27:37.789
(shouting)

27:37.856 --> 27:40.425
It's our turn.
Time to move on to the next bar.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.727
We're going to show them
how it's done.

27:42.794 --> 27:47.732
(shouting, cheering)

27:47.799 --> 27:51.369
Next up it's Billy, Zahida,
Sarah and Elettra.

27:51.436 --> 27:54.372
They're going to struggle.
We've got these lot fucked!

27:54.439 --> 27:57.509
Everyone get into pairs in a circle.
Pick your pair!

27:57.575 --> 27:58.977
We've got our work cut out.

27:59.044 --> 28:02.047
I'm shouting at the punters
and nae fucker is listening.

28:02.113 --> 28:03.381
It's not looking good.

28:03.448 --> 28:06.484
Get yous here, do a semi-circle.
Doesn't matter.

28:06.551 --> 28:08.119
Listen, lads! Lads!

28:08.186 --> 28:10.522
Billy has absolutely
flapped it here.

28:10.588 --> 28:13.324
He's whispering.
They don't know what he's saying!

28:13.391 --> 28:14.893
Right, listen!

28:14.959 --> 28:20.365
This group is very disorganised
compared to the other group.

28:20.432 --> 28:22.600
I dunno what to do.
I'm too pissed to care.

28:22.667 --> 28:24.402
(cheering)

28:24.469 --> 28:25.904
Get another shot.

28:25.970 --> 28:31.209
My team is shit, but with this body,
baby, my team win.

28:33.445 --> 28:38.016
If there's one thing Elettra is
good at, besides speaking Italian,

28:38.083 --> 28:41.386
it's giving a lapdance.
And the girl can fucking move.

28:41.453 --> 28:43.922
(cheering)

28:43.988 --> 28:47.459
Me and Nathan are smashed,
but I think it's time I got involved.

28:47.525 --> 28:50.562
Elettra, you did OK,
but let the expert through.

28:50.628 --> 28:52.263
(cheering)

28:54.766 --> 28:56.901
Go on, Chloe, grind that cock, babe.

28:56.968 --> 28:59.404
Show these bitches
exactly how it's done.

28:59.471 --> 29:03.108
(cheering, applause)

29:03.174 --> 29:04.843
Today has been mint,

29:04.909 --> 29:09.614
but Billy and Eve, I think, are
too quiet to be part of our family.

29:09.681 --> 29:12.317
(cheering)

29:19.757 --> 29:23.761
I can't believe he went to work
when he was in that state.

29:23.828 --> 29:27.699
So, the newbies and Nathan and Chloe
have been out on a bar crawl today.

29:27.765 --> 29:30.735
If that was me, I'd be putting in
a fucking massive shift.

29:30.802 --> 29:33.171
Do you think they're going to
come in mortal?

29:33.238 --> 29:34.772
Yeah, Nathan will.

29:38.943 --> 29:44.115
(chanting)
Pineapple! Pineapple! Pineapple!

29:45.250 --> 29:46.784
I am pissed.

29:46.851 --> 29:49.921
But we need to leave the workers
at home while we meet Anna.

29:49.988 --> 29:52.323
Right, newbies,
you've just been to work,

29:52.390 --> 29:54.225
go and get yourselves refreshed.

29:54.292 --> 29:56.361
The originals have gone
to meet Anna.

29:56.427 --> 29:58.596
Even though I think
I've done well today,

29:58.663 --> 30:02.534
I'm still worried cos you never know
what they could be thinking.

30:09.440 --> 30:12.043
We know Anna wants our help
to choose new workers,

30:12.110 --> 30:13.978
but we dunno what she's thinking.

30:14.045 --> 30:17.615
Our boss is keeping her cards
close to her saggy chest.

30:23.321 --> 30:26.524
Oh, there she is.
Hiya, you all right?

30:26.591 --> 30:30.328
Anna, how are you doing, petal?
I'm good, how's it been going?

30:30.395 --> 30:31.796
Really good.

30:31.863 --> 30:35.266
I still can't get over Anna
thinking we're going to tell her

30:35.333 --> 30:36.868
who works the best.

30:36.935 --> 30:39.704
So, Nathan and Chloe,
feedback from today.

30:39.771 --> 30:41.105
How did the bar crawl go?

30:41.172 --> 30:45.176
It was really, really good,
but Eve and Billy are very quiet.

30:45.243 --> 30:48.046
Eve and Billy are not
what I look for in a housemate.

30:48.112 --> 30:51.249
If they do good, I wouldn't
tell her, cos we live with them!

30:51.316 --> 30:55.019
Sam, going on work
that he did today, amazing.

30:55.086 --> 30:56.187
He's better than us.

30:56.254 --> 31:00.024
Right now, I'm all about Sam.
He's fun, he's eye candy.

31:00.091 --> 31:02.360
I think he would fit
into our Geordie squad.

31:02.427 --> 31:05.496
Sarah is very good
and very consistent.

31:05.563 --> 31:07.932
She's on top of her game
and she's doing well.

31:07.999 --> 31:09.968
Abbie has done all right, mind.

31:10.034 --> 31:11.803
Sarah and Abbie are good at work.

31:11.869 --> 31:15.206
More importantly, they feel like
they fit in with the group.

31:15.273 --> 31:17.642
You've pulled together
as a team. Amazing.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.612
Don't worry, Anna,
we are your eyes and ears.

31:20.678 --> 31:24.415
No way are we going to
let you down, you scruffy bitch.

31:24.482 --> 31:27.452
Excellent. See yous later. Be good!
(all) Bye!

31:27.518 --> 31:29.687
All in all,
another successful meeting.

31:29.754 --> 31:33.725
Now it's time to get back
to the house, cos I want to party!

31:42.567 --> 31:46.204
We're back from seeing Anna. We need
to get ready and hit the Toon.

31:46.271 --> 31:47.672
Paint the bastard blue!

31:55.747 --> 31:58.182
Every night I'm getting closer.

31:58.249 --> 32:00.285
Thing is though, mate,
it's the chase.

32:00.351 --> 32:03.388
Marty has been grafting
Elettra for days now

32:03.454 --> 32:06.457
and he still hasn't got
anywhere near her pants.

32:06.524 --> 32:09.227
I just hope for his sake
it's worth it in the end.

32:09.294 --> 32:11.729
I'm going to say Elettra,
"Come for cuddles."

32:11.796 --> 32:13.464
"Take your top off." Boom!

32:13.531 --> 32:17.535
I see weddings, I see doves,
I see little Marty Lamborghinis

32:17.602 --> 32:19.604
and little page boys running around.

32:19.671 --> 32:22.507
I think me and Elettra
are getting very close.

32:30.715 --> 32:32.283
All right, boys, come here.

32:32.350 --> 32:35.286
And now the best part of my day,

32:35.353 --> 32:39.223
going out to dancy-dancy,
maybe kissy-kissy.

32:39.290 --> 32:41.726
Enjoy your night. Enjoy, let's go!

32:41.793 --> 32:43.695
(cheering)

32:45.196 --> 32:47.131
Let's do this!

32:47.198 --> 32:49.367
Tonight is going to be
the best night yet.

32:49.434 --> 32:50.935
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:51.002 --> 32:53.404
I should be on the pull,
but I don't want to.

32:53.471 --> 32:56.741
Night after night, I have to
watch him and Elettra neck on.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.843
It's getting too much now.

32:58.910 --> 33:01.479
Sam is absolutely mortal.

33:01.546 --> 33:02.747
(laughter)

33:02.814 --> 33:05.316
That is fucking amazing.

33:05.383 --> 33:06.484
(wags tongue)

33:06.551 --> 33:08.920
Hopefully this will get steamy!

33:10.455 --> 33:12.423
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

33:14.959 --> 33:15.159
.

33:17.695 --> 33:17.895
.

33:32.744 --> 33:35.413
We get to Tup Tup. Let's do this!

33:35.480 --> 33:37.515
(cheering)

33:42.387 --> 33:45.957
We have actually filled the club up,
there's that many of us!

33:46.023 --> 33:48.025
Tonight is gonna be fucking wicked.

33:53.931 --> 33:57.502
We've all done such a good job
at work and the atmosphere is unreal.

33:57.568 --> 34:00.605
I think tonight
is going to be the best night yet.

34:13.985 --> 34:15.652
When we got back to the house,

34:15.719 --> 34:19.322
things between us were awkward,
but now it's just like old times.

34:19.389 --> 34:23.494
I should be on the pull, but I don't
want to. I'm happy right now.

34:26.397 --> 34:27.697
It feels like old times.

34:27.764 --> 34:30.501
I'm starting to wonder
if me and Aaron being friends

34:30.568 --> 34:32.103
is giving him false hope.

34:32.170 --> 34:35.273
I really hope not, cos I want him
to move on with his life.

34:50.655 --> 34:54.225
After last night, it's obvious
Chloe still has feelings for Marty.

34:54.292 --> 34:57.595
So I'm just gonna back off tonight
and enjoy meself.

35:07.672 --> 35:11.609
Last night, me and Sam got together.
It didn't really work out.

35:11.676 --> 35:15.346
And Marty stuck up for us,
but now he's all over Elettra.

35:15.413 --> 35:17.281
When am I going to get over him?

35:24.255 --> 35:25.690
I do feel sorry for Chloe.

35:25.756 --> 35:27.892
Marty will always try
to mess her about.

35:27.959 --> 35:30.061
It's like he doesn't want her
to move on.

35:30.127 --> 35:32.597
It's hard for her to watch.
What's his problem?

35:48.045 --> 35:51.949
I don't know why but I feel like I'm
overthinking about these newbies,

35:52.016 --> 35:55.786
about the family and how it
just doesn't feel like normal.

35:55.853 --> 35:57.755
The best person to speak to is Gary.

36:08.065 --> 36:11.936
It's always good to talk to Sophie.
We've been here since the start.

36:12.003 --> 36:15.606
We know, realistically, what it
does take to live in this house.

36:29.921 --> 36:33.858
We're having a mint time, but I gotta
prove my worth so I can stay here.

36:33.925 --> 36:36.127
I couldn't give a fuck
that it's Nathan.

36:36.193 --> 36:38.362
I'm gonna make this kid
weak at the knees.

36:44.235 --> 36:47.338
Sam, you are so cheeky!

36:47.405 --> 36:49.206
But I'm smiling already.

36:52.009 --> 36:53.444
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:53.511 --> 36:54.979
I've got a boyfriend.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.715
You can talk, but you can't touch.

37:11.495 --> 37:14.498
Me and Marty made a pact
not to get with anyone in the house

37:14.565 --> 37:17.802
and night after night I have to
watch him and Elettra neck on.

37:17.868 --> 37:19.704
It's getting too much now.

37:25.376 --> 37:27.345
Chloe has been doing so well,

37:27.411 --> 37:31.015
but we've been drinking all day
and her head is all over the place.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.651
So, I'm gonna do my best
to sort this all out.

37:39.957 --> 37:43.294
Nathan knows every time me and Chloe
talk when we're pissed,

37:43.361 --> 37:45.963
we just end up arguing.
So why is he trying to do it?

37:54.271 --> 37:57.875
I've said sorry, cos she's important
to me and I want her to know that.

38:00.611 --> 38:03.614
Seeing Marty with Elettra
has got me confused.

38:03.681 --> 38:05.850
He says one thing
and then does another.

38:05.916 --> 38:08.285
He is playing with my emotions.

38:14.425 --> 38:16.827
I don't know what
goes through Marty's head.

38:16.894 --> 38:20.231
I told him to stay away from Chloe
and concentrate on Elettra.

38:25.903 --> 38:28.139
I'm not good at listening to advice

38:28.205 --> 38:30.141
but Gaz has been
in my shoes before,

38:30.207 --> 38:32.943
so maybe I should start
listening a little bit more.

38:38.015 --> 38:39.316
Marty finally gets it.

38:39.383 --> 38:42.687
He needs to leave Chloe alone
and let her get on with her life.

38:42.753 --> 38:45.156
That way his life will be easier.

38:47.525 --> 38:51.028
Me, Gaz and Aaron are like triplets,
apart from they're old as fuck

38:51.095 --> 38:54.165
and I'm like the young seed
that was born ten years after.

38:54.231 --> 38:55.733
(all) Two, three, four!

39:02.673 --> 39:04.542
Tonight has been a success.

39:04.608 --> 39:06.977
It's a shame that Chloe
was upset with Marty.

39:07.044 --> 39:10.047
Other than that, I got chatted up,
so I'm still buzzing.

39:12.783 --> 39:15.553
Let's get back to the house
and continue the party.

39:24.895 --> 39:27.064
My fucking heels have come off!

39:28.666 --> 39:32.436
We're back at the house and all I
wanna do is fill me face with food.

39:34.438 --> 39:38.075
(laughter)

39:39.210 --> 39:41.846
Everyone, if you're feeling down,
look at Sam.

39:41.912 --> 39:45.282
(laughter)

39:45.349 --> 39:48.085
Sam is fucking smashed,
but this is fun to watch.

39:48.152 --> 39:52.723
(laughter)

39:52.790 --> 39:55.259
Sam is absolutely mortal.

39:55.326 --> 39:58.028
He doesn't know where he's at,
what his own name is.

39:58.095 --> 39:59.730
It's fucking hilarious.

39:59.797 --> 40:03.601
Have another bottle!
Go on, mate!

40:03.667 --> 40:06.737
You can tell that Sam
wants his place in this house,

40:06.804 --> 40:09.340
because even though
he's fucking wrecked,

40:09.406 --> 40:12.910
he is still trying to get
that bottle of beer down his neck.

40:14.078 --> 40:15.246
Go on, Sam!

40:15.312 --> 40:17.615
Everyone is egging us on
to neck this drink.

40:17.681 --> 40:19.483
I don't know why I'm doing it,

40:19.550 --> 40:22.086
cos I can feel it
coming up me throat!

40:22.153 --> 40:23.587
Well done.

40:23.654 --> 40:26.690
You're not a newbie
unless you whitey in the sink.

40:28.092 --> 40:32.229
(pukes, cheering)

40:32.296 --> 40:34.532
That is fucking amazing!

40:34.598 --> 40:35.866
(cheering, laughter)

40:35.933 --> 40:38.102
I'm drunk as fuck,
I'm having a good time,

40:38.169 --> 40:40.171
I'm busting out me dance moves...

40:40.237 --> 40:42.006
(laughter)

40:42.072 --> 40:43.774
...and I've fucked it!

40:43.841 --> 40:46.877
(laughter)
That was hilarious.

40:46.944 --> 40:49.647
I don't think I've ever laughed
as much in me life.

40:49.713 --> 40:51.615
Sam is fucking hilarious.

40:57.087 --> 41:00.524
Tonight has been shit, but I'm gonna
to try and give it one last go.

41:00.591 --> 41:02.827
I'm going to get in the tub
and wash my vaj.

41:02.893 --> 41:08.032
(moans)

41:09.233 --> 41:10.568
What the fuck?

41:10.634 --> 41:13.637
I get into the hot tub
and Chloe is riding the jet stream.

41:13.704 --> 41:16.106
Haway, save some
of them bubbles for me.

41:16.173 --> 41:17.775
(moans)

41:20.711 --> 41:21.979
Have I seen this right?

41:22.046 --> 41:25.216
Elettra is in the tub
and Nathan licks vodka off her tits?

41:25.282 --> 41:26.483
I want a slice of this!

41:28.485 --> 41:32.022
Tonight has been wicked
and all of a sudden Marty comes out.

41:32.089 --> 41:34.692
I guarantee you now
Chloe is about to go inside

41:34.758 --> 41:36.627
cos this is going to get awkward.

41:36.694 --> 41:40.197
(laughter)

41:40.264 --> 41:44.201
I'm not staying in the tub
to see them all over each other.

41:44.268 --> 41:45.636
I'm going to fucking kip.

41:49.106 --> 41:52.943
Tonight has been a wicked night.
The newbies have made an impact.

41:53.010 --> 41:55.746
I'm quite proud of them,
but for now it's bedtime.

42:00.851 --> 42:04.488
I'm having a radge time
with Elettra in the hot tub,

42:04.555 --> 42:07.558
but then she just jumps up
and fucks off, to the shower!

42:07.625 --> 42:10.361
But don't worry,
I'm right behind you, Babycakes!

42:10.427 --> 42:12.830
Hopefully this will get steamy!

42:15.666 --> 42:20.004
My shower with Marty is so funny
cos he is completely naked.

42:20.070 --> 42:21.472
And with... (wags tongue)

42:23.440 --> 42:26.343
Marty doesn't have a baby penis.

42:26.410 --> 42:30.080
He has a sausage, small but fat.

42:31.682 --> 42:33.884
Could the night
get any better than this?

42:33.951 --> 42:37.321
I've necked on with Elettra
in the tub, got steamy in the shower.

42:37.388 --> 42:40.024
It's time for bed.
Surely tonight is the night.

42:43.560 --> 42:47.398
Marty wants to fucky-fucky,
but baby... Pfft.

42:47.464 --> 42:50.034
No, no, no, you have to wait.

42:56.307 --> 42:59.143
Really?
What am I meant to do with this now?

42:59.209 --> 43:02.046
Am I ever going to get past
necking on with Elettra?!

43:08.185 --> 43:10.220
Oi, oi!

43:10.287 --> 43:12.056
It's me mate and I'm buzzing.

43:12.122 --> 43:14.491

43:14.558 --> 43:16.527
Woo! Ciao, ciao, Newcastle.

43:16.593 --> 43:19.196
The most beautiful arsehole
I've ever seen.

43:22.533 --> 43:24.735
This is the best job
you'd ever want.

43:24.802 --> 43:26.704
House party, bitches!

43:26.770 --> 43:29.373
Stroking Elettra's
clitty-clitty bang-bang.

43:29.440 --> 43:33.210
(screaming)

43:33.277 --> 43:35.846

I don't know if I'll come back.

44:01.438 --> 44:01.638
