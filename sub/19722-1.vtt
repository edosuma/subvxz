a beautiful day here

00:53.754 --> 00:55.020

00:55.022 --> 00:56.688

01:19.580 --> 01:20.813
with a very special song,

01:20.815 --> 01:22.314
dedicated to very
special someone

01:22.316 --> 01:25.150
who may not be feeling so
very special right now.

01:25.152 --> 01:30.155
Dylan my sweet old friend,
this one goes out to you.

03:05.251 --> 03:07.553
- My name is Dylan green.

03:07.555 --> 03:10.422
I'm a high school senior
from bend, Oregon.

03:10.424 --> 03:14.259
And my life? It's been
fine, until yesterday.

03:16.963 --> 03:18.130
- Hey,

03:18.132 --> 03:20.532
picked up all of
fingernail's shit again.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.869
- What do you think of this
nail color for my nails?

03:23.871 --> 03:26.104
- This is my girlfriend Katy

03:26.106 --> 03:29.474
and her annoying
dog, fingernails.

03:29.476 --> 03:32.945
- I don't know, that
color looks good I guess.

03:32.947 --> 03:35.480
Hey, listen. I've been
meaning to talk to you.

03:35.482 --> 03:36.582
- Oh hey, Dylan?

03:36.584 --> 03:37.816
- Yeah?

03:37.818 --> 03:40.452
- Umm, I was just thinking,

03:40.454 --> 03:44.056
we've been together for
all of high school now,

03:44.058 --> 03:46.491
and I just feel
like it's time to...

03:46.493 --> 03:48.293
- no way! I feel
the exact same way.

03:48.295 --> 03:49.895
- You do?
- Yeah!

03:49.897 --> 03:51.063
- Oh! That's perf!

03:51.065 --> 03:52.064
I didn't know
breaking up with you

03:52.066 --> 03:53.298
would be so easy!

03:53.300 --> 03:57.035
- What?

04:04.744 --> 04:06.878
And just like that,

04:06.880 --> 04:07.880
it's over.

04:10.049 --> 04:13.785
- Good
morning, Ms. tlif.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.754
- Hey Billy.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.296
Hmm, what a surprise.

04:31.671 --> 04:32.904
And Mr. Dylan.

04:35.475 --> 04:38.043
I noticed you missed a couple.

04:39.279 --> 04:43.015
You know you can do
better than that, right?

04:44.817 --> 04:48.387
- Yeah, whatever.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.055
- Hey Dylan, hey, dyl,

04:50.057 --> 04:52.524
hey, dude, take one of these.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.893
- What, no. What is this?

04:54.895 --> 04:56.395
- I don't know, it's
an upper or downer?

04:56.397 --> 04:57.929
Sideways? It'll
mellow you out man.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.998
- Dude, it's a tic tack.

05:01.367 --> 05:02.968
- Well yeah! I was going for
the placebo effect, you know?

05:02.970 --> 05:04.136
That's when the...

05:04.138 --> 05:06.605
- I know what
placebo means, okay?

05:06.607 --> 05:08.507
- Bro, you're loosing
your shit, alright?

05:08.509 --> 05:09.975
And over Katy?

05:09.977 --> 05:13.478
- Yeah, you don't seem
well, but you look great.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.381
- I mean yeah. Dude, all she
does is keep nagging you man!

05:16.383 --> 05:17.349
Just nag, nag, nag, you know?

05:17.351 --> 05:18.984
Like "Dylan! Dilly!"

05:20.320 --> 05:22.454
"Dilly, I just did my nails,
you need to wipe my ass!

05:22.456 --> 05:24.056
"Dilly..." god! I hate it
when she calls you that.

05:24.058 --> 05:24.990
Fuck, dude!

05:24.992 --> 05:26.224
- Yeah, you should be single.

05:26.226 --> 05:27.726
- Um, excuse me, Ms.
Tilf, I'm sorry, tlif,

05:27.728 --> 05:30.262

us a quick moment please?

05:30.264 --> 05:32.497
- Sure, I'll wait all day.

05:35.401 --> 05:37.069
- Dude, dude! Dude.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.305
This is the best thing
that's happened to you.

05:40.307 --> 05:41.773
Fuck us, man!

05:41.775 --> 05:44.443
I mean dude, we finally get
our best friends back, alright?

05:44.445 --> 05:46.144
We miss you, no

05:46.146 --> 05:48.647
- I know, man. I

05:48.649 --> 05:50.048
- I had the best fucking idea!

05:50.050 --> 05:54.353
Tonight, you, me, and
maxi, maxi's treehouse,

05:54.355 --> 05:56.488
just like the old
times before Katy.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.923
You know, maybe we'll
watch some good weed?

05:57.925 --> 05:58.757
Smoke some good porn?

05:58.759 --> 05:59.925
I don't know.

05:59.927 --> 06:03.261
- Where is maxi
anyway? Is he around?

06:03.263 --> 06:04.196
- What's up guy?

06:04.198 --> 06:05.430

You, me, Dylan, tonight,

06:08.302 --> 06:10.335

06:10.337 --> 06:12.404
- Okay, sounds good.
I'm a little busy.

06:12.406 --> 06:13.438
- You're good.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.906
He's not good, okay?

06:14.908 --> 06:16.742
You see what the wrestling team
is doing to our best friend?

06:16.744 --> 06:17.976
Alright man?

06:17.978 --> 06:18.910
He's getting his head
flushed down the toilet

06:18.912 --> 06:19.711
and we need to protect him!

06:19.713 --> 06:20.912
You're being selfish!

06:20.914 --> 06:22.414
- Selfish? I'm
not being selfish!

06:22.416 --> 06:23.215
You're being selfish. Don't
call me selfish, alright?

06:23.217 --> 06:24.449
If it wasn't for you,

06:24.451 --> 06:25.450
our buddy wouldn't
be getting his head

06:25.452 --> 06:26.952
flushed down the
toilet right now

06:26.954 --> 06:29.054
because you're so obsessed
with Amber Andrews, alright?

06:29.056 --> 06:31.289
So sack up and go
over and talk to her.

06:31.291 --> 06:33.291
- But!

06:33.293 --> 06:34.893
She talks to me in biology
class like all the time!

06:34.895 --> 06:36.161
- That's 'cause she's
your lab partner

06:36.163 --> 06:37.996
and she needs your brain, man.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.698
- No, actually she's very
smart and she's very nice

06:39.700 --> 06:40.832
and she lets me stare.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.100
- Hey Billy!

06:42.102 --> 06:44.669
Congratulations on your
scholarship into state.

06:44.671 --> 06:45.671

06:53.380 --> 06:55.580
- I applied too, just
waiting to hear back.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.682
- Yeah? That's great.

07:02.388 --> 07:04.156
Bring your beaver.

07:04.158 --> 07:05.690
- I'll remember that.

07:05.692 --> 07:08.193
And Dylan, sorry to hear
about my sister and you.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.594
Between you and I, you
can do a lot better.

07:09.596 --> 07:10.629
- Thanks.

07:10.631 --> 07:11.730

07:11.732 --> 07:13.398

07:16.904 --> 07:18.537
- Hold on, hold on.

07:19.906 --> 07:21.373
Okay.

07:21.375 --> 07:22.941
- I mean, how does
everyone know already?

07:22.943 --> 07:25.944
- Yeah man, I mean

07:25.946 --> 07:27.279
- Hey Dylan.

07:27.281 --> 07:28.713

07:28.715 --> 07:29.514
- I don't know what
you're doing after school,

07:29.516 --> 07:30.682
but you're open to it,

07:30.684 --> 07:32.684
I'm holding a
little study group.

07:32.686 --> 07:37.222
Maybe we can work on
beefing up your test scores?

07:37.224 --> 07:38.523
- Uh.

07:38.525 --> 07:40.759

If you change your mind,

07:45.065 --> 07:46.798
I'll be around the corner

07:46.800 --> 07:48.133
with my friend.

07:53.105 --> 07:55.006

relationship, dude.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.282
Holy crap.

08:07.421 --> 08:09.554
Dude, we have like the
hottest teachers in school.

08:09.556 --> 08:11.356

change her name to Ms. tilf

08:11.358 --> 08:13.692
'cause she's definitely
a teacher I'd like to...

08:13.694 --> 08:16.361

08:37.351 --> 08:39.818
I want a break from biology.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.988
Is that a frog? We

12:27.714 --> 12:30.315
College honeys running
around half naked?

12:30.317 --> 12:31.716
Dude what is wrong with you?

12:31.718 --> 12:32.617
- Ow!

12:32.619 --> 12:34.085
- I mean, look at maxi.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.587
Alright just look at him.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.388
This may be his only
opportunity to see

12:37.390 --> 12:39.290
an uncovered breast in his life.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.559
- I'm gonna go all the
way with those things too.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.595
- Well we all know
that's not true.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.997
Why don't we just go to Cancun?

12:45.999 --> 12:48.199
Fuck, while we're riding,
let's go to Florida!

12:48.201 --> 12:49.634
- We can go to Wyoming!

12:49.636 --> 12:51.536
My gg and grandpappy live there!

12:51.538 --> 12:54.205
They make the best
cinnamon rolls.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.074
- Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.175
- Yeah?

12:57.177 --> 12:58.143
- No.

12:58.145 --> 13:00.645
Does your gg have implantations?

13:00.647 --> 13:01.646
I didn't think so.

13:01.648 --> 13:04.215
And you need to get over Katy.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.518
Alright? She sucks.

13:06.520 --> 13:07.819
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.087
According to you,
she doesn't suck,

13:09.089 --> 13:10.021
she just lips the
tip a little bit

13:10.023 --> 13:11.222
and only when she's drunk.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.224
"Dilly! Dilly, look,
I'm licking it!"

13:13.226 --> 13:14.626
- Oh stop, please stop.

13:14.628 --> 13:16.060
- "Like an ice cream cone."
- I'll do anything.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.796
- "Chocolate black guy."

13:17.798 --> 13:19.430
- She does have a super rack.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.432
- Shh.

13:21.534 --> 13:22.534
Don't talk.

13:24.503 --> 13:26.437
Look at this face.

13:26.439 --> 13:30.208
Alright? Do not take this amazing
opportunity away from him.

13:30.210 --> 13:33.645
Just look at this face!
It must be tainted!

13:33.647 --> 13:34.647
- Taint.

13:42.622 --> 13:45.657
- You need this more
than we do, okay?

13:45.659 --> 13:48.326
It's my special weed
that you love so much,

13:48.328 --> 13:49.460
guaranteed to give you
the best night sleep

13:49.462 --> 13:50.929
you ever had.

13:50.931 --> 13:53.264
Just remember to wash it down
with a little bit of Jack.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.599
- Now this,

13:54.601 --> 13:57.135
is the best idea
you had all night.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.005
Finally.

14:12.718 --> 14:15.253
- Well, let's go steal a rv.

14:15.255 --> 14:16.255
- An rv?

14:57.830 --> 15:01.332
- He calls it the highway.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.001
- The highway? Wow.

15:03.869 --> 15:05.003
Who calls it that?

15:05.005 --> 15:06.638
- Mr. ralphy Peterson.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.873
And never lets me
see the inside.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.241
But lucky for us,

15:10.243 --> 15:13.011
I found where he hides his keys.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.445
- That is pretty super.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.514
- It is pretty super, maxi.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.349
- How does he
afford all of this though?

15:18.351 --> 15:19.851
- Good question,

15:19.853 --> 15:23.388
one I should know the answer
to because I do his taxes.

15:23.390 --> 15:26.491
Sorry ralphy boy!
You deserve this.

15:26.493 --> 15:29.227
- Deserve? What,
we're not taking his...

15:29.229 --> 15:31.596
- you bet your sweet
little nipples we are.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.097
He never uses it,

15:34.099 --> 15:35.033
so we will.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.868
- We can't do that to him.

15:36.870 --> 15:38.102
- Dude, just relax
okay? Trust me.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.637
He totally deserves this.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.639
He made me his bitch.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.475
And now we make
the highway ours.

15:45.577 --> 15:48.079
Here, you're driving!

15:48.081 --> 15:50.148
- What do you mean?

15:50.150 --> 15:51.616
- What do you mean
"what do I mean"?

15:51.618 --> 15:52.817
I'm sick and tired
of you being a pussy

15:52.819 --> 15:54.886
and not getting your
drivers license.

15:54.888 --> 15:56.120
- But...
- Shh!

15:59.725 --> 16:00.992
Don't talk.

16:00.994 --> 16:02.226
- Okay.

16:02.228 --> 16:05.129
- Drivers ed 101
begins right now.

16:07.334 --> 16:09.534
- Okay, I can do this.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.936
- Yes you can! And you will!

16:16.109 --> 16:18.609
Let the games begin, Max Max!

16:22.449 --> 16:24.949
- Wait, where's Dillon?

16:43.369 --> 16:45.436
- Yeah, eat it.

16:45.438 --> 16:46.738
Eat it, diggle!

16:48.173 --> 16:49.574
Swallow it hard.

16:52.445 --> 16:53.911
Good afternoon, Dylan!

16:53.913 --> 16:55.980
Nice of you to finally join us!

16:55.982 --> 16:59.851
- What the fuck.

16:59.853 --> 17:03.254
Why does it
feel like we're moving?

17:03.256 --> 17:04.722
- You see, Dylan,

17:06.759 --> 17:09.093
we live in the here, in the now.

17:09.095 --> 17:10.428
And right now is the now.

17:10.430 --> 17:11.896
You're living it right now.

17:11.897 --> 17:13.731
So I'll tell you what,

17:13.733 --> 17:16.000
let's not give a fuck and
live it up right now, m'Kay?

17:16.002 --> 17:16.834
- M'Kay!

17:16.836 --> 17:18.536
- M'Kay there, maxi?

17:18.538 --> 17:20.704
- M'Kay. You sound
like that Dr. Phil guy.

17:20.707 --> 17:21.539
- M'Kay Dylan?

17:21.540 --> 17:22.540
- M'Kay!

17:23.809 --> 17:27.310
Why are we dressed like
a metrosexual biker gang?

17:27.313 --> 17:28.846
- Well we, uh, you know,

17:28.848 --> 17:30.181
had a little covert
operation last night,

17:30.183 --> 17:32.383
you, me, and maxi.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.285
I didn't want us to get
pinched by the Peterson.

17:34.287 --> 17:37.121
- Mr. Peterson,
like autoshop Mr. Peterson?

17:37.123 --> 17:38.389
You took his rv?

17:38.391 --> 17:41.359
- It's his recreational vehicle.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.860
- You stole the highway?

17:42.862 --> 17:44.829
- Wonder if we pissed
off the Peterson?

17:49.668 --> 17:50.601
- What the...

17:50.603 --> 17:51.436
- fuck?

17:51.438 --> 17:53.071
- Hey, you. Shh!

17:53.073 --> 17:54.906
- It.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.441
Shut up, asshole!

17:56.443 --> 17:59.410
- Where are we going,
anyway? So janky.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.079
- Dude, we're on our
way to lake havasu

18:01.081 --> 18:02.914
for our bro-cation, remember?

18:02.916 --> 18:04.582
- Bro-cation celebration!

18:04.584 --> 18:06.017
- Yeah, I remember.

18:06.019 --> 18:08.086
I remember saying I didn't
wanna be part of the bro-cation.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.420
- But it's a celebration.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.655
- Whatever, alright?

18:10.657 --> 18:12.256
Just pull over, I
need to take a piss.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.758
- Okay, brother, there's
a bathroom on this thing.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.259
- I'll pass.

18:15.261 --> 18:18.029
- Alright, suit yourself.

18:19.699 --> 18:20.699
Maxi!

18:23.001 --> 18:24.001
Pit stop.

18:41.354 --> 18:45.189
So, hear this is where a
lot of penises hang out.

18:52.531 --> 18:53.798
Who was that?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.900
- Hey man, you talking
shit in there or what?

18:55.902 --> 18:58.202
- Yeah, yeah yeah yeah.

18:58.204 --> 19:00.171
Feel you on that one, asshole,

19:00.173 --> 19:01.173
good shit.

19:03.409 --> 19:05.510
- God, enough of
the shit talk man.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.345
We get it, alright?

19:07.347 --> 19:10.281
Billy shake your
dick and let's go.

19:14.487 --> 19:18.389
- Hey, that was a shitty
thing for you to say.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.493
- What's taking so long?

19:22.495 --> 19:24.829
We've been standing
here forever!

19:24.831 --> 19:26.330
- Let's just go, man!

19:26.332 --> 19:28.432
We're already dressed like
the hamburgular anyway,

19:28.434 --> 19:31.636
we might as, oh, ho.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.037
It's good stuff.

19:34.640 --> 19:38.309
Hey, this is my friend Billy
and he thinks you're cute.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.912
- Yeah. Yeah yeah, yeah.

19:40.914 --> 19:41.914
I do.

19:42.614 --> 19:43.614
I do.

19:44.416 --> 19:45.983
Where you been hiding?

19:45.985 --> 19:48.386
- Here on the corner,

19:48.388 --> 19:49.520
talking shit.

19:50.389 --> 19:52.623
Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.626
Yeah.

19:56.662 --> 19:57.662
- Yeah?

19:59.131 --> 20:01.532
Guys, guys guys guys guys.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.201
Have you seen the
back of the rv?

20:03.203 --> 20:04.435
It's insane!

20:04.437 --> 20:05.536
There's a painting back
there of a hot blonde

20:05.538 --> 20:07.038
with perfect pectorals,
unbelievable!

20:07.040 --> 20:10.741
Oh, and I found this!

20:10.743 --> 20:11.609
- What is it?

20:11.611 --> 20:12.810
- Just wrong, man.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.879
- Dude, come on.
It's Mrs. Peterson.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.581
Who's the hottest
pe teacher ever!

20:16.583 --> 20:18.783
- I never seen one
in real life before.

20:18.785 --> 20:21.452
- Have a feeling
Max Max, go for it.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.788
Dude, I bet she uses
this on Ms. tilf.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.823
I bet you they use
it on each other!

20:25.825 --> 20:29.827
Oh my god, you can't
lose! Give me that back!

20:29.829 --> 20:31.829
Oh Mrs. Peterson,
you taste so good.

20:35.802 --> 20:38.169
- Are you ready for me, Ralph?

20:45.744 --> 20:46.978
- Alright, we get it.

20:46.980 --> 20:47.945
You like licking
floppy pink dildos.

20:47.947 --> 20:50.248
Just drop it already, please!

20:50.250 --> 20:51.916
- Alright fine. I'll
drop it if you drop it.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.484
- Drop what? What am I dropping?

20:53.486 --> 20:54.619
- Your bad attitude!

20:54.621 --> 20:55.753
- I don't have a bad attitude,

20:55.755 --> 20:56.954
you're just being annoying.

20:56.956 --> 20:57.922
- We need to fully commit,

20:57.924 --> 21:01.025
right here, right now, alright?

21:01.027 --> 21:03.661
Dylan, are you in or are you in?

21:03.663 --> 21:05.763
- Come on, Dylan. Be in.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.199
Be in deep. Come in.

21:08.201 --> 21:10.134
- Okay. Okay, I'm in.

21:10.136 --> 21:11.736
Alright? I'm in.

21:11.738 --> 21:12.803
- Fuck yeah.

21:13.839 --> 21:17.575
Let's do this right,
hands in boys.

21:17.577 --> 21:19.176
Spring bro-cation on three.

21:19.178 --> 21:20.111
One, two, three!

21:20.113 --> 21:22.013
- Spring bro-cation!

21:22.015 --> 21:23.281
- Alright, we'll work on it.

21:32.959 --> 21:36.594
- Hey, check out this
boat we can rent.

21:36.596 --> 21:38.062
It's cool, right?

21:40.165 --> 21:42.400
- The backyard
boat? Awesome sauce!

21:42.402 --> 21:44.468
- Dude, this is amazing!

21:45.804 --> 21:47.505
We could throw our own parties,

21:47.507 --> 21:48.706
cruise the lake!

21:48.708 --> 21:50.474
- Maxi, let me get that
credit card number.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.777
- Trust me and Dylan.

21:52.779 --> 21:55.079
- Okay, I trust in the Dylan.

21:55.081 --> 21:57.715
- Good boy. Such a
trusting young lad.

21:57.717 --> 21:58.983
- Alright boys,

21:58.985 --> 22:00.785
the backyard boat
is officially ours!

22:41.160 --> 22:42.426
- You guys, guess what.

22:42.428 --> 22:44.395
I saw a sign for a
strip joint diner.

22:44.397 --> 22:46.497
I'm thinking we should
get our eats on in style.

22:46.499 --> 22:49.567
- Get our eats on in some style?

22:49.569 --> 22:53.437
Dude, you wonder why your
penis is still a virgin, Jesus.

22:53.439 --> 22:55.373
Alright, I'm down to dine
with some dick in it.

22:55.375 --> 22:56.874
Dylan, you're down to
dine with some dick in it?

22:56.876 --> 22:58.209
Oh no, wait, you miss the
negatives of the Katy!

22:58.211 --> 23:00.478
Oh no dy...

23:00.480 --> 23:03.414
- it's a strip club diner
in the middle of nowhere.

23:03.416 --> 23:06.684
It's probably a bad idea, right?

23:06.686 --> 23:07.686
- Maxi?

23:09.221 --> 23:10.221
Strip club.

23:23.835 --> 23:25.736
- Um, hey guys?

23:25.738 --> 23:27.204
Do you think we
should've stopped here?

23:27.206 --> 23:28.739
It looks kinda shady.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.808
- It was your idea to stop here.

23:30.810 --> 23:31.876
- I know but

23:32.778 --> 23:34.145
are there gonna be boobies?

23:34.147 --> 23:35.045
- Of course there's
gonna be boobs in there,

23:35.047 --> 23:36.180
it's a strip club, man!

23:36.182 --> 23:37.415
Look, the rv's
parked, we're outside.

23:37.417 --> 23:38.716
Let's just eat. I'm hungry.

23:38.718 --> 23:39.550
- Alright, you know what?

23:39.552 --> 23:41.585
Stop! Alright guys?

23:41.587 --> 23:42.587
Gentlemen?

23:45.424 --> 23:46.924
It's times like these
we ask ourselves,

23:46.926 --> 23:48.025
are we dudes who give a fuck

23:48.027 --> 23:49.393
or are we men?

23:49.395 --> 23:50.594
I, for one, am a man.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.329
And I've chosen a path to

23:53.166 --> 23:55.166
beware of tits.

23:55.168 --> 23:58.736
- Bottomless
diner and strip joint.

24:00.639 --> 24:01.839
- Fuck it,

24:01.841 --> 24:03.908
let's just hope no
one sees us, alright?

24:03.910 --> 24:07.411
- Whoa! Yes!

24:09.715 --> 24:11.449
What's up, boys?

24:11.451 --> 24:12.650
I'm dons.

24:12.652 --> 24:13.484
- Dons?

24:13.486 --> 24:16.987

24:16.989 --> 24:17.988
- Hey, I'm Billys.

24:17.990 --> 24:20.124
- That's tight.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.559
- Were you just snorting
cocaine in front of us?

24:21.561 --> 24:22.493
- Nah, nah, no way man.

24:22.495 --> 24:25.396
I don't mess with the cocaine.

24:25.398 --> 24:27.264
I rock the blue powder.

24:27.266 --> 24:28.132
- What's the blue powder?

24:28.134 --> 24:29.533
- It makes the blood

24:29.535 --> 24:32.436
rush right to your
Johnson, where it belongs.

24:32.438 --> 24:35.439

Whoa,

25:21.320 --> 25:24.788
- Fix? Fix what?

25:24.790 --> 25:26.790
- You know what
I'm talking about.

25:26.792 --> 25:29.760
And I'm not talking
about that silly whistle.

25:29.762 --> 25:32.463
But you landed in
just the right place.

25:32.465 --> 25:33.465
And, uh,

25:36.969 --> 25:38.802
New stripper!

25:38.804 --> 25:41.805
This is a bottomless
strip joint!

25:41.807 --> 25:43.374
We don't show our tits here!

25:43.376 --> 25:45.209
You're still breast
feeding for Christ sake!

25:45.211 --> 25:46.143
- Hey guys!

25:46.145 --> 25:48.078
Welcome to beware of tits.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.347
Where not only the food
and drinks are bottomless,

25:50.349 --> 25:52.149
but so are the girls.

25:52.151 --> 25:55.386
So, are you guys
eating out or inside?

25:56.254 --> 25:59.089
- Uh, what?

25:59.091 --> 26:00.324
- What do you recommend?

26:00.326 --> 26:02.326
- I mean I sure do
love eating out,

26:02.328 --> 26:04.161
but come on in, guys.

26:05.430 --> 26:07.164
- So you're telling me
that there are no tatas?

26:07.166 --> 26:08.499
- Nope.

26:08.501 --> 26:09.433
- The best part of
the female anatomy

26:09.435 --> 26:10.834
is not being shown tonight?

26:10.836 --> 26:12.236
- Sorry Charlie.

26:13.305 --> 26:14.305
- Billy.

26:17.275 --> 26:18.509
- Have a seat.

26:22.682 --> 26:24.582
- Here you go.

26:24.584 --> 26:26.350
Hope you guys like
a boxed lunch.

26:26.352 --> 26:27.651
- Yeah, thanks.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.589
Nice find, maxi.

26:31.591 --> 26:33.223
Beware of tits.

26:33.225 --> 26:34.358
- Hello boys!

26:35.460 --> 26:37.828
Can I get you some
drinks started?

26:37.830 --> 26:42.032
Like everything around
here, they are bottomless!

26:42.034 --> 26:45.536
Well, unlike myself at
this particular moment.

26:45.538 --> 26:47.037
- Uh yeah!

26:47.039 --> 26:49.306
Can we get two blow jobs and
a glass of milk for this guy?

26:49.308 --> 26:50.308
Thank you.

26:52.944 --> 26:55.512
- Ah, just the drinks for now.

26:56.648 --> 26:57.648
Thank you.

26:58.718 --> 27:01.151
- I gotta go rock a pole.

27:03.121 --> 27:05.656
- Why are we friends with him?

27:05.658 --> 27:06.724
- He's nice.

27:14.833 --> 27:17.234
- I think you boys will
probably like to try

27:17.236 --> 27:20.638
some of our famous
bottomless wings and fries?

27:20.640 --> 27:24.208
- Yeah sure, that
would be great.

27:24.210 --> 27:25.709
Fuck! What she just say?

27:25.711 --> 27:27.611
- She said she thinks I'm cute

27:27.613 --> 27:28.846
and horny.

27:28.848 --> 27:30.714
- She said that you're horny?

27:30.716 --> 27:31.882
- I am horny.

27:33.418 --> 27:35.185
What do I do?

27:35.187 --> 27:36.420
- Oh, I don't know.

27:36.422 --> 27:37.621
I've been out of the
game for a while.

27:37.623 --> 27:40.758
Why don't you go
ask loverboy there?

27:40.760 --> 27:42.226
What is he doing?

27:43.261 --> 27:45.396
- Ay yo guys, check this out!

27:45.398 --> 27:47.297
I call this one

Pretty good, huh?

27:48.467 --> 27:49.867
You come try it!

27:51.670 --> 27:53.170

27:55.675 --> 27:57.041
I just saw some tits.

27:57.043 --> 27:58.242
Take your tits and split.

27:58.244 --> 27:59.777

27:59.779 --> 28:00.978
I have a flat ass!
Look at my ass!

28:00.980 --> 28:02.112
You smack it, nothing happens!

28:02.114 --> 28:03.047
- Oh blame your mother!

28:03.049 --> 28:04.181
- It's not her fault dons!

28:04.183 --> 28:05.115
- Oh write a novel!

28:05.117 --> 28:06.283
- Stop talking about my mom.

28:06.285 --> 28:07.918
The man wants tatas,
dons. Come on!

28:09.855 --> 28:10.988
- You wanna see her tits?

28:10.990 --> 28:11.989

28:11.991 --> 28:13.190
- You wanna show him your tits?

28:13.192 --> 28:14.458
- I wanna show
him my tits, dons.

28:14.460 --> 28:17.027
- One time. One time I
can make an agreement.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.896
- Okay, thank you!

28:18.898 --> 28:20.397
- You wanna shake on it?

28:20.399 --> 28:21.498
- We should shake, make it
a gentleman's handshake.

28:21.500 --> 28:22.332
- Yes, okay.

28:22.334 --> 28:23.567
Wait.
- What?

28:23.569 --> 28:24.768
- Tit shake.
- Tit shake?

28:24.770 --> 28:25.803
- Tit shake.
- Tit shake?

28:25.805 --> 28:26.870
- Never turned one down.

28:26.872 --> 28:29.606
- Never had one before.

28:35.346 --> 28:36.580
- Did that just happen?

28:36.582 --> 28:39.450
- Okay, here is your food.

28:39.452 --> 28:41.985
I was thinking maybe
you and I could go

28:41.987 --> 28:46.056
maintain eye contact
for a little while?

28:46.058 --> 28:47.257
Yeah. Come on!

28:47.259 --> 28:48.392
Come on, come on.

28:48.394 --> 28:49.727
Come on.

28:49.729 --> 28:51.095
- See you, buddy.

28:53.132 --> 28:54.132
- What?

28:59.571 --> 29:00.471
- So cool!

29:00.473 --> 29:01.905
- Yeah!
- Dude, come on!

29:01.907 --> 29:03.407
Fuck yeah!

29:03.409 --> 29:07.277
- You got her number, huh?
- Got her number buddy!

29:07.279 --> 29:08.645
Where's the rv?

29:08.647 --> 29:09.713
- The rv?

29:09.715 --> 29:12.149
- The recreational vehicle, man!

29:12.151 --> 29:13.151
- Maxi!

29:14.886 --> 29:16.186
- Excuse me, sir.

29:17.256 --> 29:18.256
Jesus Christ!

29:20.126 --> 29:22.760
He's got a gun, he's got a gun.

29:25.196 --> 29:26.663
- Ay man, come on.

29:26.665 --> 29:28.365
Can you cut us some slack
man? Give me a break!

29:28.367 --> 29:30.768
- Does it look like I got
a kit crap bar on me, boy?

29:30.770 --> 29:32.770
- Aww, he gotta
get out of the car.

29:32.772 --> 29:34.071
He's getting out.

29:34.073 --> 29:36.774
- You know what's even worse?

29:36.776 --> 29:38.475
It's not my fault you
let your rv run itself

29:38.477 --> 29:41.979
into the middle
of my cornfields.

29:41.981 --> 29:42.980
- Where's the corn?

29:42.982 --> 29:44.181
- It's growing.

29:44.183 --> 29:46.583
Yeah, rookie mistake
mission boys.

29:46.585 --> 29:47.818
- Alright, you're right.

29:47.820 --> 29:49.119
It was our mistake,
it was our bad.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.988
But everyone makes
mistakes, right?

29:50.990 --> 29:53.123
Have you ever made a mistake?

29:53.125 --> 29:54.358
- Nope. Never.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.234
- Come on, just look at him!

30:04.236 --> 30:05.636
Look at his face.

30:05.638 --> 30:07.271
- You can taint it.

30:11.076 --> 30:12.943
- You want me to
taint your face, boy?

30:12.945 --> 30:14.011
- Maybe not.

30:15.547 --> 30:16.780
- Alright look, I mean,

30:16.782 --> 30:19.483
clearly you've made
a mistake before.

30:19.485 --> 30:22.786
- No, I never made "a" mistake.

30:22.788 --> 30:25.022
- Never? You wanted
to look like this?

30:25.024 --> 30:26.323
- Sexy as shit?

30:27.492 --> 30:29.326
You mission boys hard
of hearing or something?

30:29.328 --> 30:31.795
- Mission boys? Why do you
keep calling us mission boys?

30:31.797 --> 30:35.933
- Well you are on a
mission, aren't you?

30:35.935 --> 30:38.502
- Dude we just walked
out of a strip club.

30:38.504 --> 30:41.371
And we're driving a rv,
not riding bicycles.

30:41.373 --> 30:43.106
- Drink alcohol too?

30:44.142 --> 30:45.108
- Yeah.

30:45.110 --> 30:46.243
- Drink coffee?

30:46.245 --> 30:47.077
- Of course.

30:47.079 --> 30:47.911
- Tea?

30:47.913 --> 30:49.012

30:49.014 --> 30:49.947
- You fuckers do blow?

30:49.949 --> 30:51.248
- No! Whoa!
- No!

30:51.250 --> 30:52.583
What does that have
to do with anything?

30:52.585 --> 30:53.984
- Well I'm higher than shit!

30:53.986 --> 30:55.819
- That's cool, man.

30:55.821 --> 30:58.121
- Alright, how much Turkey

30:58.123 --> 30:58.989
- Turkey?

30:58.991 --> 31:00.224
- Yeah, Turkey.

I ate pussy for breakfast.

31:09.134 --> 31:10.701
- Oh fuck, he wants cash.

31:10.703 --> 31:12.202
- No shit.

31:12.204 --> 31:13.170
- I don't have any cash on me,

31:13.172 --> 31:14.104
I only brought my card.

31:14.106 --> 31:15.572
- I don't have any cash.

31:15.574 --> 31:16.406
- You boys should've
thought of that,

31:16.408 --> 31:17.975
now shouldn't you?

31:21.579 --> 31:24.181
- Um look, Mr. Johnathan.

Is that okay?

31:37.362 --> 31:39.196
- You call this Turkey?

31:39.198 --> 31:42.132
I call this here toilet paper.

31:42.134 --> 31:43.694
- He's gonna wipe his
ass with my money.

31:49.641 --> 31:52.109
Gonna make it rain.

31:52.111 --> 31:54.444
- Okay, look sire
Johnathan please,

31:54.446 --> 31:55.979

31:55.981 --> 31:57.447
My entire future with Amber
Andrews depends on this trip.

31:57.449 --> 31:58.949
Will you please let us go?

31:58.951 --> 32:00.584
I will do anything!

32:02.320 --> 32:03.320
- Anything?

32:05.356 --> 32:06.356
- Anything.

32:14.499 --> 32:15.499
- Well,

32:16.968 --> 32:18.568
thanks for the buff, boys.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.037
- You're welcome.

32:21.406 --> 32:24.141
- You missed a spot.

32:25.143 --> 32:26.143
- Well,

32:27.078 --> 32:28.245
that was fun.

32:29.647 --> 32:30.647
- You know,

32:32.383 --> 32:33.717
you seemed to have
failed to mention

32:33.719 --> 32:36.787
that Amber Andrews, Katy
Andrew's twin sister,

32:36.789 --> 32:38.655
was gonna be on this trip.

32:38.657 --> 32:40.357
- Aw man, please no.

32:40.359 --> 32:41.725
- Yeah yeah yeah man,

32:41.727 --> 32:43.360
I thought that you
organized this whole shindig

32:43.362 --> 32:44.928
for a little bro-cation time

32:44.930 --> 32:46.129
with your best friends.

32:46.131 --> 32:47.731
But now it looks like
someone's a little

32:47.733 --> 32:49.433
hoes before bros on this trip.

32:49.435 --> 32:50.667
- Dude, I just,

32:50.669 --> 32:51.568
I could really use
your support, okay?

32:51.570 --> 32:52.903
- You need confidence!

32:52.905 --> 32:54.171
Alright? Confidence.

32:54.173 --> 32:56.373
Just go up to her,
present yourself,

32:56.375 --> 32:57.374
tell her how you feel!

32:57.376 --> 32:58.742
It's not that hard.

32:58.744 --> 32:59.977
- No, you know what?

32:59.979 --> 33:00.979
It is hard.

33:02.313 --> 33:03.847
You're giving me a raging
boner right now dude.

33:03.849 --> 33:05.582
You're really good at this!

33:05.584 --> 33:06.717
I need to grow some balls,

33:06.719 --> 33:08.051
you're absolutely right!

33:08.053 --> 33:09.286
- That's true,

33:09.288 --> 33:10.520
and I'm glad that
I could give you

33:10.522 --> 33:12.990
a little emotional
support on this rv.

33:14.492 --> 33:16.093
All this food and the weed

33:16.095 --> 33:17.894
is making me a little ti-ti,

33:17.896 --> 33:20.964
so I think Dylan
is gonna go to bed.

33:28.039 --> 33:30.040
- Why don't you talk?

33:30.042 --> 33:32.976
- You guys always
tell me not to.

33:32.978 --> 33:34.544
- Really?

33:38.484 --> 33:39.783
- Oh what is it man?

33:39.785 --> 33:40.951
You can talk.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.320
- I don't know.

33:44.756 --> 33:47.324
I guess I just feel it's time.

33:49.827 --> 33:51.795
- "It's time"?

33:51.797 --> 33:53.430
- Yeah. To lose it.

33:56.267 --> 33:58.268
You know, my virginity.

34:00.738 --> 34:05.075
I just want it over with
and so does my daddy.

34:05.077 --> 34:06.343
- Daddy, seriously.

34:06.345 --> 34:07.310
- Yeah.

34:07.312 --> 34:08.378
He's always buying me condoms

34:08.380 --> 34:10.380
and for my birthday last year,

34:10.382 --> 34:14.618
he even paid for a hooker
to come over and touch me.

34:16.754 --> 34:19.456
- I always knew I
liked your daddy.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.491
- I was super nervous,

34:21.493 --> 34:24.127
so I just hid in the closet.

34:24.129 --> 34:26.429
- Bro? It is time to
come out of the closet.

34:26.431 --> 34:27.397
I mean what's wrong?

34:27.399 --> 34:28.899
- I don't know.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.134
It feel like it's all the
pressure from it, maybe?

34:31.136 --> 34:32.936
Apparently he's quite
the stud in the bedroom

34:32.938 --> 34:36.907
and he's partaken
threesomes and orgies

34:36.909 --> 34:38.041
and fourgies.

34:39.811 --> 34:40.976
- What's a fourgie?

34:40.978 --> 34:42.746
- I don't know.

34:42.748 --> 34:43.748
- Whoa.

34:44.581 --> 34:46.016
- I'm just scared.

34:46.018 --> 34:47.951
- You scared? Scared of what?

34:47.953 --> 34:49.085
- Well like,

34:49.088 --> 34:50.719
what if I don't last long?

34:50.722 --> 34:52.856
What if she laughs at it?

34:54.192 --> 34:56.493
I don't think my dick can
handle that kind of rejection.

34:56.495 --> 34:57.861
- Dude, don't even
worry about it.

34:57.863 --> 34:59.763
I mean premature ejaculation
is totally normal

34:59.765 --> 35:01.198
and hot chicks are just
used to it anyways,

35:01.200 --> 35:02.466
it's all good.

35:04.470 --> 35:05.735
But dude,

35:05.737 --> 35:06.670
you need to get over
this whistling sound

35:06.672 --> 35:07.471
you make with your mouth.

35:07.473 --> 35:08.972
I mean what is that?

35:08.974 --> 35:10.240
It's like when the subject of
sex with a female comes up,

35:10.242 --> 35:12.876
I feel like someone's
brewing a pot of tea.

35:12.878 --> 35:14.144
You know what you need to do?

35:14.146 --> 35:17.013
You need to reinvent yourself.

35:17.015 --> 35:18.615
It's time for a makeover.

35:18.617 --> 35:21.218
Extreme makeover, maxi edition.

35:21.220 --> 35:23.220
You are no longer maxi,

35:23.222 --> 35:25.522
the scared little
whistling virgin,

35:25.524 --> 35:29.426
forever doomed to a life
of swirlies and toilets.

35:29.428 --> 35:30.428
You are now

35:32.897 --> 35:33.897
Maximus.

35:34.999 --> 35:35.999
- Maximus.

35:38.102 --> 35:40.537
- Maximus cunnilingus clitoris.

35:40.539 --> 35:41.838
- Maximus.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.740
- Son to an orgy master.

35:43.742 --> 35:45.075
- Maximus.

35:45.077 --> 35:47.410
- Recent member of tits amazing.

35:47.412 --> 35:48.745
- Maximus.

35:48.747 --> 35:50.313
- And recipient of
a cocktail napkin

35:50.315 --> 35:51.648
with a phone number on it

35:51.650 --> 35:53.116
from a cocktail
waitress who works at

35:53.118 --> 35:55.385
beware of tits, bottomless
diner and strip joint.

35:55.387 --> 35:56.387
- Maximus.

35:57.388 --> 35:59.656
- You shall lose it.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.158
- I shall.

36:01.160 --> 36:03.493
- In this life or the next.

36:05.129 --> 36:06.796
Preferably this life.

36:06.798 --> 36:07.798
- Maximus,

36:08.566 --> 36:10.167
I like that.

36:10.169 --> 36:13.069
I am Maximus
cunnilingus clitoris.

36:14.906 --> 36:16.039
- Maximus.

36:16.041 --> 36:17.274
- Maximus.

36:30.955 --> 36:32.856
- Sweet dreams there, maxi?

36:32.858 --> 36:34.758
- No, had a nightmare.

36:36.327 --> 36:38.728
Billy? What's a cunnilingus?

36:40.698 --> 36:43.800
Think I had a nightmare
about it last night.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.769
Is it some sort of monster?

36:45.771 --> 36:47.537
- Monster, yeah.

36:47.539 --> 36:50.607
Just gonna have to find out
for yourself there, kiddo.

36:50.609 --> 36:52.409
- Are we there yet man?

36:52.411 --> 36:54.077
We've been driving forever
and this place is hotter

36:54.079 --> 36:56.246
than a prostitute's
asshole, alright?

36:56.248 --> 36:57.180
Where is this place?

36:57.182 --> 36:58.782
- Calm your tits, Betty white.

36:58.784 --> 37:00.016
I got an idea!

37:01.052 --> 37:02.185
Compact disk!

37:07.892 --> 37:08.892
Here we go!

37:24.710 --> 37:25.742
- Come on, go!

37:25.744 --> 37:26.943
- I'm driving.
- Come on, man!

37:26.945 --> 37:28.712
Get up!
- Okay, drive.

37:39.958 --> 37:42.392
- Who is that? Why
is he honking at us?

37:42.394 --> 37:43.793
- What a douche.

38:03.649 --> 38:05.215
Oh my goddess, hi.

38:05.217 --> 38:06.950
- Hey guys, welcome
to the nautical.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.151
I'm Jordan.

38:08.153 --> 38:09.586
Are you checking
in with SWAT today?

38:09.588 --> 38:10.387
- I got this.

38:10.389 --> 38:11.588
- Okay.

38:11.590 --> 38:15.158
- Hi. We are checking
in as chaperones.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.826
- Chaperones?

38:16.828 --> 38:19.362
- Okay, I was just about to
step out for my lunch break,

38:19.364 --> 38:20.897
but don't worry,

38:20.899 --> 38:22.399
I'll go find somebody who
can take care of you guys.

38:22.401 --> 38:23.401
- Ah, what?

38:25.336 --> 38:26.870
- Don't worry about
my friend maxi here.

38:26.872 --> 38:27.804
He almost got laid last night

38:27.806 --> 38:29.039
but couldn't quite close.

38:29.041 --> 38:30.273
- Aw, don't worry about it.

38:30.275 --> 38:32.942
Maybe your luck will
change here in havasu.

38:32.944 --> 38:33.910
- So cute.

38:33.912 --> 38:35.478
- Alright, well good luck boys.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.881
- Ah, thought that would work.

38:37.883 --> 38:39.516
- You thought that would work?

38:39.518 --> 38:40.518
- Yeah.

38:48.526 --> 38:49.759
Hi there friend.

38:49.761 --> 38:53.196
We are checking
in as chaperones.

38:53.198 --> 38:55.165
- It's pronounced freend.

38:55.167 --> 38:56.499
Freend. Freend.

38:57.735 --> 38:58.735
- Okay.

39:00.938 --> 39:02.272
- Names please.

39:04.542 --> 39:06.409
- Okay, uh this is Dylan.

39:06.411 --> 39:07.977
I'm Billy, that's maxi.

39:07.979 --> 39:09.379
- Maximus.
- Maximus.

39:09.381 --> 39:10.780
- I take it you all of age?

39:10.782 --> 39:13.350
- I take it you're of all age.

39:14.919 --> 39:16.853
- Would you like to see some
identification there, friend?

39:16.855 --> 39:17.921
- It's okay.

39:19.156 --> 39:20.757
You look like you're 30.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.192
- He's actually 35.

39:26.097 --> 39:28.331
- I can see that.

39:29.867 --> 39:33.670
You understand the responsibilities
of a SWAT chaperone?

39:33.672 --> 39:36.005
- What's a chaperone?

39:36.007 --> 39:37.273
- Oh don't worry about this guy.

39:37.275 --> 39:39.242
He doesn't even know
what cunnilingus is.

39:39.244 --> 39:41.911
- What's a cunnilingus?

39:41.913 --> 39:43.880
- It's a scary monster.

39:45.116 --> 39:46.683
- With an unibrow.

39:50.588 --> 39:53.456
- Basically your responsibilities
are to make sure

39:53.458 --> 39:56.793
that kids under the age
are not drunk in public

39:56.795 --> 39:59.362
or fighting, fighting.

39:59.364 --> 40:00.296
You know what fighting is?

40:00.298 --> 40:03.233
- Yeah, I know what fighting is.

40:03.235 --> 40:04.467
- You notice
anything suspicious,

40:04.469 --> 40:08.037
you grab any of our
security guard and

40:08.039 --> 40:10.039
you report it.

40:10.041 --> 40:11.541
- So we're basically narcs?

40:11.543 --> 40:12.709
- Yes!

40:12.711 --> 40:14.177
- Perfect!

40:14.179 --> 40:18.014
You guys ready to make
some new friends? Freends?

40:52.183 --> 40:54.250
- Hello? Is anyone here?

40:58.155 --> 40:59.155
- Uh?

41:04.495 --> 41:05.829
- Uh,

41:05.831 --> 41:07.997
uh we're here about
the backyard boat?

41:12.069 --> 41:15.438
- Well the backyard boat,
why didn't you just say so?

41:15.440 --> 41:16.606
- I just did.

41:17.641 --> 41:19.509
We rented it through
your website?

41:19.511 --> 41:21.711
- I don't got no website.

41:21.713 --> 41:22.879
- Yes you do.

41:25.015 --> 41:26.249
- No, I don't.

41:27.284 --> 41:28.852
- I think that you do.

41:28.854 --> 41:30.753
- Fuck you.
- Fair enough.

41:30.755 --> 41:32.622
- Isn't this you?

41:32.624 --> 41:34.157
- Uncool ronathan's

41:34.159 --> 41:38.561
havasu boating adventures
paradise, lake havasu lake.

41:38.563 --> 41:40.830
- Yeah, that's me.

41:40.832 --> 41:42.799
- So then you do have a website?

41:42.801 --> 41:43.833
- No shit.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.235
- What the fuck?

41:46.504 --> 41:47.904
- Grab my stuff.

41:49.240 --> 41:52.775
Feels good in there.

41:52.777 --> 41:54.444
- What is he doing?

41:56.280 --> 41:59.415
Alright, must sign
right here boy.

41:59.417 --> 42:03.253
You want me to hold it
out like this for you?

42:04.722 --> 42:07.657
- You want us to sign your arm?

42:07.659 --> 42:08.625
- I'm not holding it out here

42:08.627 --> 42:10.226
for you choir boys to stare at.

42:10.228 --> 42:12.495
- Here, I'll sign.

42:12.497 --> 42:14.063
- Just be careful.

42:25.509 --> 42:26.576
- Life vest,

42:27.878 --> 42:29.379
we're gonna need some beer.

42:29.381 --> 42:30.381
- Alright.

42:31.315 --> 42:32.949
- Wait, you're not
coming with us, are you?

42:32.951 --> 42:34.484
- If it was up to me,

42:34.486 --> 42:37.420
we'd all be coming together
by the end of the night.

42:37.422 --> 42:38.354
- Well, it's just...

42:38.356 --> 42:41.324
- don't you "welp" me, boy!

42:41.326 --> 42:42.659
- I didn't really
want tapdance around

42:42.661 --> 42:46.396
with a bunch of fucking
sissy sallys anyway.

42:50.634 --> 42:53.102
- But this map just
leads us right back here.

42:53.104 --> 42:55.939
- I don't see any
life vests or beer

42:55.941 --> 42:58.908
around these little
arms, now do I?

42:59.910 --> 43:01.811
Cute little hands.

43:01.813 --> 43:02.813
So sexy.

43:06.617 --> 43:08.217
- Thank you.

43:08.219 --> 43:09.619
We'll see you later,

43:09.621 --> 43:10.420
run, run, run, run!

43:10.422 --> 43:11.422
- Hey!

43:12.790 --> 43:15.425
You boys come back here.

43:15.427 --> 43:17.293
- Who are those cute boys?

43:17.295 --> 43:19.295
And what did they want?

43:20.764 --> 43:24.334
- Fuck you.

43:36.347 --> 43:38.748
Took the advice on the beer.

43:39.750 --> 43:41.184
Good stuff.

43:44.055 --> 43:45.121
Here she is.

43:46.223 --> 43:48.958
Backyard beauty,
in all her glory.

44:09.913 --> 44:11.114
- Well guys,

44:11.116 --> 44:13.149
it looks like everyone
really like us!

44:13.151 --> 44:14.350
- Oh yeah, they
like us, alright.

44:14.352 --> 44:15.385
Just jealous of our
backyard beauty.

44:15.387 --> 44:16.719
Great find Dylan!

44:16.721 --> 44:17.787
- Good find Dylan.

44:17.789 --> 44:19.656
- Thank you, boys.

44:19.658 --> 44:20.890
- Jesus Christ,

44:20.892 --> 44:22.925
it's a stripper
pole on this boat?

44:22.927 --> 44:24.460
Billy why won't you go shake
your ass on that thing?

44:24.462 --> 44:25.862
See what happen?

44:28.867 --> 44:30.199
- Whatcha doing?

44:30.201 --> 44:32.101
- Dude, I think my
bone-ar's going off.

44:33.371 --> 44:34.303
- What the fuck are you doing?

44:34.305 --> 44:35.038
- Dude, I can't control it,

44:35.040 --> 44:36.040
it's my bone-ar.

44:47.118 --> 44:48.118
- Tlif?

44:50.187 --> 44:52.588
- Tilf titties?
Titties in a tilf.

44:52.590 --> 44:56.693
- Go away!

44:56.695 --> 44:58.261
- We need to get off this boat.

45:18.415 --> 45:20.383
- Man, what a plethora
of pretty pillows around!

45:20.385 --> 45:21.551
Jeez!

45:21.553 --> 45:22.752
- Thank you for bringing
me out here, boys.

45:22.754 --> 45:23.720
I appreciate it.

45:23.722 --> 45:25.288
This is our week, alright?

45:25.290 --> 45:27.010
This is our week to get
after it. You ready?

45:28.760 --> 45:30.426
Son of a bitch, really?

45:30.428 --> 45:31.661
- What? Is that Amber?

45:31.663 --> 45:33.863
- No. What the fuck
is she doing here man?

45:33.865 --> 45:35.665
- Aw, that chick sucks!

45:35.667 --> 45:36.667
- Nope.

45:37.367 --> 45:38.367
- Oh yeah.

45:40.037 --> 45:42.138
- Man, shit. But seriously,
what is she doing here?

45:42.140 --> 45:44.540
Fuck it, I'll be right back.

45:46.910 --> 45:48.578
Katy.

45:48.580 --> 45:49.812
What the fuck are
you doing here?

45:49.814 --> 45:50.980
Is this why you
broke up with me,

45:50.982 --> 45:52.749
so you can be all slutty
over spring break?

45:52.751 --> 45:53.983
- You know dilly,

45:53.985 --> 45:55.384
I love everything
that you did for us.

45:55.386 --> 45:56.219
It's just...

45:56.221 --> 45:57.453
- it's just what? What?

45:57.455 --> 45:58.688
You don't care about me at all?

45:58.690 --> 45:59.689
You rather hang out
with these fucktards?

45:59.691 --> 46:01.157
- What's up, dog?

46:02.559 --> 46:03.559
I'm the dj.

46:04.561 --> 46:07.263
The dj! Spring break dj!

46:07.265 --> 46:08.265
Dj Tanner!

46:09.066 --> 46:10.867
Check out my banner!

46:10.869 --> 46:13.035
Woo hoo, woo hoo, woo hoo, woo!

46:14.439 --> 46:16.739
- The fuck are you doing? Stop.

46:16.741 --> 46:19.609
Is this your ex old lady?

46:19.611 --> 46:21.911
She got a nice rack on her.

46:25.415 --> 46:26.983
Thanks for sharing.

46:26.985 --> 46:29.051
- What the fuck are you
talking about? Stop!

46:29.053 --> 46:30.319
- Sharing is caring, dog!

46:30.321 --> 46:31.454
- Stop calling me dog!

46:31.456 --> 46:33.122
This isn't 1999, alright?

46:33.124 --> 46:34.524
Just go back to your
fucking dj booth,

46:34.526 --> 46:35.758
this is my girlfriend.

46:35.760 --> 46:39.162
- But dilly, we
broke up, remember?

46:39.164 --> 46:41.164
This is the guy I was
telling you about.

46:41.166 --> 46:42.698
I met him on tender.

46:42.700 --> 46:46.002
He's gonna be like
the next skrillres.

46:46.004 --> 46:47.236
- Sorry to steal your hot girl

46:47.238 --> 46:49.806
and kick your ass
off my boat dog.

46:49.808 --> 46:52.308
Unfortunately this is my boat

46:53.677 --> 46:56.345
and she doesn't seem
to want you anymore.

46:56.347 --> 46:58.281
So why don't you
make like the trees

46:58.283 --> 46:59.849
and get out.

46:59.851 --> 47:01.517
- Just get away from me, man!

47:01.519 --> 47:03.119
- Wow!

47:03.121 --> 47:06.189
Well, it appears
you're out of time.

47:07.858 --> 47:09.358
And we have a full house,

47:09.360 --> 47:11.527
so you better get your ass
off this boat before I...

47:11.529 --> 47:13.029
- before you what?

47:13.031 --> 47:15.151
Before you flex your t-shirt
titties in my face again?

47:17.502 --> 47:18.334
It's not funny.

47:18.336 --> 47:19.202
- You know I won't,

47:19.204 --> 47:20.436
but they will.

47:21.538 --> 47:24.440
Danny, Joey, uncle Jessie,

47:24.442 --> 47:25.875
get him.

47:28.513 --> 47:29.645
- Get off me, man.

47:29.647 --> 47:30.713
Stop. Stop.

47:30.715 --> 47:31.647
What are you doing?

47:31.649 --> 47:32.649
Hey!

47:36.421 --> 47:38.955
- Aw, it's too bad dog.

47:38.957 --> 47:41.591
I liked you. You
have a cute face.

47:41.593 --> 47:42.859
- Fuck you man.

47:42.861 --> 47:44.527
- Dylan you shouldn't
have come all this way

47:44.529 --> 47:46.562
to try and get me back.

47:46.564 --> 47:47.797
- I didn't.

47:49.567 --> 47:50.567
- Dilly!

47:51.335 --> 47:55.304
You totes got me wet!

47:56.240 --> 47:57.807
- That guy's like a real dj

47:57.809 --> 48:00.243
and I got a sticker!

48:00.245 --> 48:01.911
Okay.

48:01.913 --> 48:03.579
Alright, look guys,

48:03.581 --> 48:05.514
I just need a second
to myself, alright?

48:05.516 --> 48:09.318
Just go have fun, I'll catch
up with you guys later.

48:09.320 --> 48:10.686
- What? Come on, man!

48:10.688 --> 48:12.321
We're in this together bro!

48:12.323 --> 48:14.056
It's a bro-cation, remember?

48:14.058 --> 48:16.092
- So I'll catch
up with you later.

48:16.094 --> 48:17.426
- Don't leave, bro!

48:17.428 --> 48:18.628
- Dude!

48:18.630 --> 48:19.829
- Bro!

48:19.831 --> 48:21.364
- Dude!

48:21.366 --> 48:22.465
- Bro.

48:22.467 --> 48:23.467
- Dude.

48:25.936 --> 48:26.936
Let him go.

48:30.007 --> 48:31.240
Let him go.

48:39.116 --> 48:42.785
- That can not be
good for her health.

48:42.787 --> 48:43.787
Dude,

48:44.488 --> 48:46.188
that's my destiny's child!

48:51.662 --> 48:54.063
Excuse me for a second.

48:54.065 --> 48:56.699
I have some balls to attend to.

48:58.235 --> 48:59.235
- What?

49:03.840 --> 49:05.508
- Hey!

49:05.510 --> 49:06.510
Hey.

49:08.412 --> 49:09.612
- You made it.

49:10.614 --> 49:11.781
- I'm so glad you came!

49:11.783 --> 49:13.182
- Well yeah, I'm
always happy to come.

49:13.184 --> 49:14.617
Uh, be here.

49:14.619 --> 49:17.119
- You look so familiar to me.

49:21.491 --> 49:22.525
- Hey Michelle.

49:22.527 --> 49:23.826
- He knows me?

49:23.828 --> 49:24.994
- Hey!

49:24.996 --> 49:25.928
You guys should
totally check out the

49:25.930 --> 49:26.595
killer boat we rented this week.

49:26.597 --> 49:27.596
It's awesome.

49:27.598 --> 49:28.431
- Really?
- Really?

49:28.433 --> 49:30.232
- No, it actually sucks.

49:30.234 --> 49:31.834
- What color is it?

49:31.836 --> 49:34.603
- What's your favorite
color, Michelle?

49:34.605 --> 49:35.771
- Leopard!

49:35.773 --> 49:38.040
- Yeah, we got a leopard boat.

49:38.042 --> 49:39.675
Yeah, we do. We do.

49:40.544 --> 49:42.778
Sorry. Sorry not sorry.

49:46.384 --> 49:47.216
- Hi.

49:47.218 --> 49:48.284
- Why hello.

49:49.052 --> 49:50.052
- Can I,

49:51.221 --> 49:54.724
can I try a sample of
your hample nample?

49:54.726 --> 49:56.359
- Good choice, kid.

50:00.497 --> 50:02.798
Sample of hample
nample, coming in hot.

50:02.800 --> 50:04.100
- Uh, okay. Uh.

50:07.571 --> 50:10.573
Oh wow! That's a super sample!

50:10.575 --> 50:12.608
- Super sample hample nample.

50:12.610 --> 50:16.345
- Can I get that in a
captain's cone please?

50:19.450 --> 50:21.083
So what you're asking for

50:21.085 --> 50:25.321
is some hample nample which
not to sample?

50:27.758 --> 50:30.059
I'm not sure if we have
anymore of that flavor.

50:30.061 --> 50:33.095
I'm going to have to
check in with the captain.

50:33.097 --> 50:34.097
Boss!

50:34.998 --> 50:35.998
Hey boss!

50:41.606 --> 50:45.074
This very nice silly
looking man right here

50:45.076 --> 50:46.542
would like to know

50:46.544 --> 50:48.377
if we have any hample nample

50:48.379 --> 50:50.379
in which not to sample?

51:05.063 --> 51:06.529
Seems like it's your lucky day.

51:06.531 --> 51:09.265
The captain just said we do.

51:09.267 --> 51:11.934
Would you like one scoop or two?

51:15.339 --> 51:16.339
Here's one,

51:20.912 --> 51:22.311
and there's two.

51:24.381 --> 51:27.683
I'll do a little
something special for ya.

51:27.685 --> 51:31.921
Gonna put a little icing
on the cake.

51:34.691 --> 51:36.258
That's gonna taste a lot better

51:36.260 --> 51:39.562
if you eat it through your nose.

51:39.564 --> 51:41.197
- Through my nose?

51:51.708 --> 51:53.275
- Hey! Nice shirt!

51:58.282 --> 51:59.282
Whoa.

52:00.617 --> 52:03.652
You didn't get rid of that
from the other night, kid?

52:03.654 --> 52:05.387
That is not awesome.

52:09.526 --> 52:10.860
- I recognize you!

52:10.862 --> 52:13.229
You're don! The owner
of beware of tits!

52:13.231 --> 52:15.231
- Dons, with a s. Dons.

52:16.900 --> 52:17.967
How you doing, kid?

52:17.969 --> 52:19.668
- Maxi?

52:19.670 --> 52:20.503
- Mindy?

52:20.505 --> 52:21.505
- Maxi!

52:23.540 --> 52:24.373
Maxi.

52:24.375 --> 52:26.008
Maxi Max, maxi Max.

52:27.010 --> 52:28.744
What are you doing here?

52:28.746 --> 52:30.746
I'm so excited to see you again!

52:30.748 --> 52:31.981
- What are you doing here?

52:31.983 --> 52:34.083
- I don't remember
what I'm doing here.

52:34.085 --> 52:36.118
- Are you a strip dancer
for them as well?

52:36.120 --> 52:37.953
- No way, I get, um,

52:37.955 --> 52:39.522
horny when I dance.

52:39.524 --> 52:41.624
So I leave that to
the professionals

52:41.626 --> 52:44.226
who have self control.

52:44.228 --> 52:46.695
Isn't this place amazing?

52:46.697 --> 52:48.430
It makes me so excited,

52:48.432 --> 52:50.566
like not just in my face.

52:51.902 --> 52:54.270
- Ice cream boy, you wanna
hit the lake with us?

52:54.272 --> 52:55.237
- For real?

52:55.239 --> 52:57.339
- Yeah boy! Here we go!

52:57.341 --> 52:59.675
- Sounds great!

53:07.918 --> 53:11.053
- Your technique is a
little weak, you know.

53:11.055 --> 53:11.954
- I didn't know
there was a technique

53:11.956 --> 53:14.190
for skipping rocks.

53:14.192 --> 53:17.159
- Oh yeah, here.
Let me show you.

53:17.161 --> 53:18.694
So the trick is to

53:18.696 --> 53:21.564
get down low,
close to the water,

53:21.566 --> 53:23.532
and with the right flat rock

53:23.534 --> 53:25.167
and a good release,

53:27.170 --> 53:28.103
that's how it's done.

53:28.105 --> 53:29.405
- That's not bad.

53:29.407 --> 53:30.239
- Thanks.

53:30.241 --> 53:31.974
- I'm Dylan.

53:31.976 --> 53:33.108
- Hi. Sarah.

53:33.110 --> 53:34.176
- Nice to meet you.

53:34.178 --> 53:35.177
- Yo Sarah,

53:35.179 --> 53:36.178
you gonna get a room?

53:36.180 --> 53:38.581
Or can we get the ball back?

53:39.583 --> 53:42.151
- I'm gonna grab that, thanks.

53:44.754 --> 53:46.822
Shouldn't you be partying
with all the crazy people?

53:46.824 --> 53:48.023
- Yeah, well, um,

53:48.025 --> 53:50.826
my two friend
brought me out here

53:50.828 --> 53:53.095
to get me away
from my girlfriend,

53:53.097 --> 53:54.563
or ex-girlfriend.

53:55.665 --> 53:57.766
And it turns out that
she's already here,

53:57.768 --> 54:02.004
on some boat with a bunch of
drunk idiots wearing neon.

54:02.939 --> 54:04.940
I'm sorry, I guess I'm just,

54:04.942 --> 54:06.275
stuck in this stupid place

54:06.277 --> 54:08.043
and I don't know what to do.

54:08.045 --> 54:11.146
- Hey, this stupid
place I call home.

54:12.515 --> 54:13.582
- Yikes. Uh.

54:15.051 --> 54:17.086
Can we start over?

54:17.088 --> 54:18.520
- Okay.

54:18.522 --> 54:21.857
- I'm Dylan, spring
breaker from bend, Oregon.

54:21.859 --> 54:24.927
And apparently I
can't skip rocks.

54:24.929 --> 54:27.196
- Hello Dylan from bend, Oregon.

54:27.198 --> 54:30.666
I'm Sarah, a havasu
local and a freshman.

54:32.068 --> 54:34.169
- You're a freshman?

54:34.171 --> 54:35.638
- In college.

54:35.640 --> 54:36.640
- College.

54:38.074 --> 54:39.074
Nice.

54:41.444 --> 54:43.879
- What are you doing tonight?

54:43.881 --> 54:46.248
- Tonight I'm probably
going back to my hotel room

54:46.250 --> 54:49.018
to hide from my ex-girlfriend
for the rest of the week.

54:49.020 --> 54:50.753
- Okay well

54:50.755 --> 54:53.122
my friends and I are having
a get together tonight.

54:53.124 --> 54:54.723
You're welcome to stop by

54:54.725 --> 54:56.959
if you can muster a smile.

54:59.496 --> 55:00.629
- Okay, sure.

55:01.598 --> 55:03.332
Yeah, why not?

55:03.334 --> 55:04.533
- Okay!

55:04.535 --> 55:07.736
Here, give me your
number. I'll text you.

55:07.738 --> 55:10.205
- Confident girl asking
for my number, I like that.

55:10.207 --> 55:12.141
- So I'll see you tonight maybe?

55:12.143 --> 55:13.776
- Yeah. Definitely.

55:15.679 --> 55:16.679
See ya.

55:45.008 --> 55:46.175
- That was awesome!

55:49.513 --> 55:51.647
- That's my thumb.

55:51.649 --> 55:52.649
I'm sorry.

55:53.550 --> 55:54.950
- Uh, it's okay.

55:56.219 --> 55:57.286
You tripped.

56:03.227 --> 56:05.561
- Hey, how you doing gorgeous?

56:05.563 --> 56:06.795
What's your name?

56:06.797 --> 56:10.132
I'm cash, but everybody
calls me the cashtag.

56:12.335 --> 56:13.535
- I'm Amber.

56:13.537 --> 56:16.305
- Ooh, beautiful name Amber!

56:16.307 --> 56:17.506
Oh, look at this.

56:17.508 --> 56:18.874
Mind standing it up for me?

56:18.876 --> 56:20.075
Here we go.

56:20.077 --> 56:22.544
The cashtag's ready
to get willied,

56:22.546 --> 56:23.645
free Willy style.

56:23.647 --> 56:25.180
Come on, let's jump that rock!

56:25.182 --> 56:26.415
- Oh! I love sharks!

56:26.417 --> 56:29.451
- He said his name
is cash, right?

56:30.321 --> 56:31.754
- Yeah.

56:31.756 --> 56:33.889
Don't worry, I got a hashtag
for you, small person!

56:33.891 --> 56:35.524
- There's a small person here?

56:35.526 --> 56:37.793
Small people make me feel

56:37.795 --> 56:39.461
like a great, big giant.

56:39.463 --> 56:43.899
- Hashtag, give up now.

56:43.901 --> 56:47.603
'Cause the cashtag gets
what the cashtag wants.

56:47.605 --> 56:50.339
Of course
you can! Don't be shy!

56:50.341 --> 56:52.174
He wants to do a beer bong.

56:52.176 --> 56:54.777
Why, you can do a beer
bong. Here you go.

56:54.779 --> 56:56.011
Yeah let's do a, oh
that's a good idea.

56:56.013 --> 56:57.913
Two of them 'cause
he's not a baby, right?

56:57.915 --> 56:58.747
- Take it like a man!

56:58.749 --> 56:59.749
- Let's go Billy!

57:04.955 --> 57:06.188
- Oh! Wipeout!

57:07.323 --> 57:08.690
Don't worry ladies,
I got this covered.

57:08.692 --> 57:11.360
Don't worry, don't worry.

57:11.362 --> 57:15.297
Hashtag, say hi to
your vagina for me.

57:15.299 --> 57:17.933
It's okay, he's alright,
he's alright, he's alright.

57:17.935 --> 57:19.234
I think he's just a
little embarrassed

57:19.236 --> 57:20.569
because he made you look bad.

57:20.571 --> 57:22.237
You know, we'll just
give him a little space.

57:22.239 --> 57:23.939
Let's get out of here,
I know another party.

57:23.941 --> 57:24.907
Come here, sweetheart.
- Let's go with him.

57:24.909 --> 57:25.741
Let's go.
- There we go.

57:25.743 --> 57:27.075
- Where are we going?

57:27.077 --> 57:28.444
It's alright small person,

57:28.446 --> 57:30.479
you're gonna be okay?

57:30.481 --> 57:32.014
Do you have a name?

57:48.832 --> 57:49.832
- Get up!

57:55.371 --> 57:56.605
I gotta tell you...

57:56.607 --> 57:59.107
- so, where does
a maxi come from?

58:00.009 --> 58:01.109
- My mom's vagina.

58:04.681 --> 58:05.681
Bend.

58:06.749 --> 58:09.051
- You want me to bend?

58:09.053 --> 58:13.255
- No, that's where I'm
from. Bend, Oregon.

58:13.257 --> 58:14.723
- Oh!

58:14.725 --> 58:15.958
Oh that's cool.

58:15.960 --> 58:18.060
I've dated a lot of
people who live in bend.

58:18.062 --> 58:22.130
Actually, I believe the
population of bend is 81,236,

58:22.132 --> 58:23.398
give or take a few.

58:23.400 --> 58:26.168
- Wow. I didn't even know that.

58:26.170 --> 58:28.971
- So what kind of kinky stuff

58:28.973 --> 58:31.206
does one get into in bend?

58:32.442 --> 58:34.476
- Like what do I do for sex?

58:36.347 --> 58:39.047
I don't know, I'm
kind of a nerd.

58:39.049 --> 58:42.117
This is probably as
close as I've ever come.

58:42.119 --> 58:43.352
- I like nerd.

58:45.388 --> 58:46.722
- I like space.

58:49.025 --> 58:50.092
No, no, I'm kidding.

58:50.094 --> 58:51.627
I'm sorry,

58:51.629 --> 58:54.096
what I mean was I'm kinda
obsessed with outer space.

58:54.098 --> 58:55.430
- Oh! Okay.

58:55.432 --> 58:57.199
Did you that neutron stars spins

58:57.201 --> 58:59.334
at a rate of 600
rotations per second

58:59.336 --> 59:02.037
and that all of
space has no sound?

59:02.039 --> 59:04.273
Do you wanna go for a swim?

59:04.275 --> 59:05.207
I'll put on your little shorts

59:05.209 --> 59:06.341
and you can put on my overalls.

59:06.343 --> 59:07.343
Come on.

59:08.978 --> 59:10.779
- Hey ice cream boy.

59:10.781 --> 59:12.114
- Yeah?

59:12.116 --> 59:14.283
- Come here for a second.

59:19.289 --> 59:20.289
Come here.

59:21.057 --> 59:24.693
Yeah, still there.

59:24.695 --> 59:25.695
Look,

59:26.696 --> 59:29.164
mindy, she likes you.

59:29.166 --> 59:31.366
I can tell. Yeah.

59:31.368 --> 59:33.769
And I like that. I like that.

59:33.771 --> 59:35.437
That's awesome.

59:35.439 --> 59:36.772
- I think I like her too.

59:36.774 --> 59:38.607
- Then tell her.

59:38.609 --> 59:40.576
Girls like a guy
with confidence,

59:40.578 --> 59:44.046
a guy that take
charge, like dons.

59:44.048 --> 59:46.148
- I never really had
confidence with girls.

59:46.150 --> 59:47.282
- Watch this.

59:51.287 --> 59:52.521
Jesse, Kayden,

59:53.623 --> 59:57.159
come over here and
give dons some sugar!

59:57.161 --> 59:58.560
A little hustle!

59:59.529 --> 01:00:02.698
Ooh. Ooh.

01:00:06.369 --> 01:00:07.369
Yeah. Yeah.

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:11.607
I wanna taste you.

01:00:13.344 --> 01:00:14.176
- Let me in!

01:00:14.178 --> 01:00:16.111
- Okay.

01:00:17.081 --> 01:00:18.747
Sharing is caring.

01:00:25.823 --> 01:00:28.824
That'll make your dick hard.

01:00:28.826 --> 01:00:29.758
- It did.

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.660
- Alright ladies,

01:00:31.662 --> 01:00:35.030
I gotta talk to
maxi for a second.

01:00:35.032 --> 01:00:36.431
Hey.

01:00:36.433 --> 01:00:37.666
Alright,

01:00:37.668 --> 01:00:41.169
if you had to choose
between eating hot dog

01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:45.974
or a taco, what
would you choose?

01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:47.042
- I love hot dogs.

01:00:47.044 --> 01:00:48.276
- Wrong answer!

01:00:48.278 --> 01:00:50.012
Hot dogs only been
in ball parks.

01:00:50.014 --> 01:00:52.014
You want to eat tacos.

01:00:52.016 --> 01:00:53.749
- Taco.
- Tacos.

01:00:53.751 --> 01:00:55.217
- Tacos.
- Tacos.

01:00:55.219 --> 01:00:56.985
- That's what my daddy
keeps telling me.

01:00:56.987 --> 01:01:00.322
- From now on,
dons is your daddy.

01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:03.191
You need to think
what dons would think.

01:01:03.193 --> 01:01:04.793
What would dons do?

01:01:04.795 --> 01:01:08.296
Where's the pussy?
Where's the pussy?

01:01:08.298 --> 01:01:11.800
I dunno. I dunno, I
don't see it anywhere.

01:01:13.136 --> 01:01:14.369
Wait a second!

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:17.172
Do you know what a
pussy looks like?

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:19.041
- Oh, I've seen pictures.

01:01:19.043 --> 01:01:22.077
- Right. Intimidating
to look at,

01:01:22.079 --> 01:01:23.912
but fun when you're in there.

01:01:23.914 --> 01:01:25.580
- Like a waterpark.

01:01:26.382 --> 01:01:27.983
- Like a waterpark, sure.

01:01:27.985 --> 01:01:30.619
Here, put your hands like this.

01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:32.821
Tight now.

01:01:32.823 --> 01:01:33.823
Open it up.

01:01:34.757 --> 01:01:36.558
And that's a pussy.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.626
Do it again.

01:01:38.661 --> 01:01:39.494
And that's a pussy.

01:01:39.496 --> 01:01:40.662
Again. That...

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:44.066
A, that's a, a,

01:01:44.068 --> 01:01:47.269
you got it,
you got it. Okay.

01:01:47.271 --> 01:01:48.970
Alright, like this.

01:01:48.972 --> 01:01:49.972
Come on.

01:01:51.074 --> 01:01:52.074
Pound.

01:01:53.342 --> 01:01:54.910
- Pound. Pound?

01:01:54.912 --> 01:01:56.244
- What are you, in
preschool? Pound!

01:01:56.246 --> 01:01:58.280
Powerful hip thrust!

01:01:58.282 --> 01:01:59.381
Pound.

01:01:59.383 --> 01:02:01.850
- Pound?
- Pound! Pound.

01:02:01.852 --> 01:02:03.985
Pound. Here, let me show you.

01:02:03.987 --> 01:02:04.987
Let me show you.

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:08.457
Come with me now.

01:02:08.459 --> 01:02:10.692
Pound, pound, pound, pound.

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:15.464
- Pound, pound, pound, pound!

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:20.001
- I am Maximus!

01:02:20.003 --> 01:02:20.869
- The Maximus!

01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:21.703
- Mad Maximus!

01:02:21.705 --> 01:02:22.771
- Yeah!
- Yes!

01:02:22.773 --> 01:02:24.072
- That was awesome, kid!

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:25.006
- I am awesome!

01:02:25.008 --> 01:02:27.509
- You wanna get high and fuck?

01:02:27.511 --> 01:02:29.277
- Wait, you?

01:02:29.279 --> 01:02:31.012
- I mean with girls.

01:02:32.648 --> 01:02:33.482
- Hey, how's it going?

01:02:33.484 --> 01:02:34.316
Can I grab a shirt?

01:02:34.318 --> 01:02:35.150
- Yeah, whatever.

01:02:35.152 --> 01:02:36.818
- Where's maxi?

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.587
- Dude, I don't know.
Fucker vanished!

01:02:38.589 --> 01:02:39.821
And he didn't hake a
cell phone with him,

01:02:39.823 --> 01:02:41.723
so we have no way
to contact him.

01:02:41.725 --> 01:02:42.657
- Is he okay?

01:02:42.659 --> 01:02:44.025
- Yeah, I'm sure he's fine.

01:02:44.027 --> 01:02:45.494
He's probably lost or scared,

01:02:45.496 --> 01:02:47.395
you know, all the monster
melons walking around?

01:02:47.397 --> 01:02:49.865
- There you go again
with that titty talk.

01:02:49.867 --> 01:02:50.799
You got a problem, man.

01:02:50.801 --> 01:02:52.033
You should see someone about it.

01:02:52.035 --> 01:02:53.602
- Man, I don't have a problem.

01:02:53.604 --> 01:02:55.437
Alright? You have a problem!

01:02:55.439 --> 01:02:56.972
Man, titties were designed
for us to fantasize about,

01:02:56.974 --> 01:02:58.507
and that's exactly what I do.

01:02:58.509 --> 01:03:00.742
I fantasize about the beautiful
a to double d sized titties

01:03:00.744 --> 01:03:02.184
with with quarter
sized pink nipples.

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:07.549
Man, why do I let
people push me around?

01:03:07.551 --> 01:03:09.284
I mean, I'm a decent
looking lad, right?

01:03:09.286 --> 01:03:10.685
- 'Cause it's not
about looks, alright?

01:03:10.687 --> 01:03:11.887
Sometimes it's about confidence,

01:03:11.889 --> 01:03:13.889
and for some reason,
when it comes to Amber,

01:03:13.891 --> 01:03:15.791
you don't have any.

01:03:15.793 --> 01:03:17.492
Why? What happened.

01:03:17.494 --> 01:03:19.060
- Well I mean,

01:03:19.062 --> 01:03:20.495
I was hanging out with her,

01:03:20.497 --> 01:03:23.799
you know, making
her laugh and smile.

01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:25.801
Such a beautiful smile.

01:03:27.203 --> 01:03:30.138
Man I think she's finally
looking at me differently.

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.174
- So that's amazing.
That's a good thing, right?

01:03:32.176 --> 01:03:33.675
- Yeah, but then some
hashtag douchebag showed up

01:03:33.677 --> 01:03:34.910
and totally stole
her away from me!

01:03:34.912 --> 01:03:35.844
- What you mean
"stole her away"?

01:03:35.846 --> 01:03:37.379
What is he, a viking?

01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:38.780
- No, that asshole
made me look bad

01:03:38.782 --> 01:03:40.315
and took my woman from me.

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:41.583
I mean, what the fuck?

01:03:41.585 --> 01:03:43.685
- Dude, girls like assholes!

01:03:43.687 --> 01:03:45.120
She was probably hoping
that you would be an asshole

01:03:45.122 --> 01:03:49.591
and tell this guy to
eat a dick or something.

01:03:49.593 --> 01:03:51.726
- Yeah, yeah yeah yeah.

01:03:51.728 --> 01:03:53.094
- Yeah.

01:03:53.096 --> 01:03:55.063
- Probably right.

01:03:55.065 --> 01:03:56.965
Totally gonna punch that
hashtag douchebag in the dick

01:03:56.967 --> 01:03:59.267
next time I see him.

01:03:59.269 --> 01:04:00.802
- What's hashtag?

01:04:00.804 --> 01:04:02.204
- Don't worry about it.

01:04:02.206 --> 01:04:05.707
- Hey man, you know?
Punch that dick.

01:04:05.709 --> 01:04:08.109
- Literally punch the penis.

01:04:10.913 --> 01:04:14.115
- So I met a cutie
today, local girl.

01:04:14.117 --> 01:04:15.617
Yeah, her name is Sarah.

01:04:15.619 --> 01:04:16.451
- Girl?

01:04:16.453 --> 01:04:17.485
- She's a freshman.

01:04:17.487 --> 01:04:18.753
- I love young girls.

01:04:18.755 --> 01:04:19.888
- In college.

01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:22.090
- Look at you!

01:04:22.092 --> 01:04:23.558
- Right?

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.227
- Getting with the older,
more experienced, huh?

01:04:25.229 --> 01:04:27.562
- Yeah, she invited
us to a party.

01:04:27.564 --> 01:04:29.631
Probably gonna be a
lot of hot girls there,

01:04:29.633 --> 01:04:31.633
help get your mind off of Amber.

01:04:31.635 --> 01:04:32.901
Wanna come?

01:04:32.903 --> 01:04:36.371
- I can't. Got a
mission to accomplish.

01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:38.640
Gotta fist a dick.

01:04:38.642 --> 01:04:40.342
You have fun with
that college pussy!

01:04:40.344 --> 01:04:42.043
- You're ridiculous, man.

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:44.512
- I agree, I agree.

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:55.390
- Hey.

01:04:59.262 --> 01:05:00.495
You look lost.

01:05:02.498 --> 01:05:03.498
I'm Zach.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.034
- Okay, I'm Dylan.

01:05:06.036 --> 01:05:08.236
- Are you new
around here, Dylan?

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:11.373
- I'm just visiting,
actually, Zach.

01:05:11.375 --> 01:05:13.174
- Oh, well cool,
man. Where from?

01:05:13.176 --> 01:05:14.876
- From Oregon.

01:05:14.878 --> 01:05:18.380
- Well it's nice for
you to stop by, Dylan.

01:05:18.382 --> 01:05:20.115
Hey, you wanna play some pong?

01:05:20.117 --> 01:05:22.050
It's just apple j,
this is a sober party.

01:05:22.052 --> 01:05:22.984
- No, I'm good.

01:05:22.986 --> 01:05:23.919
I was just looking for Sarah,

01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:24.853
do you know if she's around?

01:05:24.855 --> 01:05:26.254
- Yeah, go find her!

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:27.188
- Thanks buddy.

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:29.891
- Oh hey, actually, take this.

01:05:29.893 --> 01:05:31.092
It's apple juice.

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:33.662
- No, I'm good man.
I'm just gonna...

01:05:33.664 --> 01:05:34.664
- take it.

01:05:35.965 --> 01:05:38.366
You really need to try this.

01:05:40.636 --> 01:05:42.437
It's freshly squeezed

01:05:43.706 --> 01:05:44.773
and organic.

01:05:46.742 --> 01:05:48.076
- Okay, thanks.

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:50.845
- Yo, yo,

01:05:50.847 --> 01:05:53.815
does her brother
know you're here?

01:05:53.817 --> 01:05:55.083
- Hey.

01:05:55.085 --> 01:05:56.284
- Oh, hey loverboy!

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:57.752
- How's it going?

01:05:57.754 --> 01:05:58.754
- Okay.

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:01.022
- I'm sorry.

01:06:02.725 --> 01:06:05.527
So, uh, what's the story?

01:06:05.529 --> 01:06:06.795
- What's the story?

01:06:06.797 --> 01:06:08.363
- Yeah.

01:06:08.365 --> 01:06:10.932
- Are you nervous to hang
out with me or something?

01:06:10.934 --> 01:06:12.968
- No, I just don't
know anyone here

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:15.870
so it's a little
awkward, I guess.

01:06:17.473 --> 01:06:20.308
- Well, uh, let
me introduce you.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:22.344
- Cool.
- Yeah.

01:06:22.346 --> 01:06:24.479
Hey everyone! This is Dylan!

01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:27.849
He's a spring breaker
from, bend, Oregon?

01:06:27.851 --> 01:06:28.984
- Yep.

01:06:28.986 --> 01:06:30.452
- From bend, Oregon!

01:06:30.454 --> 01:06:31.686
- Hey guys. How's it going?

01:06:33.256 --> 01:06:34.823
How's it going?

01:06:34.825 --> 01:06:36.124
Thank you for that,
I appreciate it.

01:06:36.126 --> 01:06:37.325
- You're welcome.

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:39.761
- Kinda appreciate it.
- Yep, no problem.

01:06:39.763 --> 01:06:42.163
Well, you seem happier.

01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:43.431
You were pretty down earlier.

01:06:43.433 --> 01:06:45.200
- Yeah, sorry about that.

01:06:45.202 --> 01:06:46.968
- No, it's good.

01:06:46.970 --> 01:06:49.270
How long were you with
that girl, anyway?

01:06:49.272 --> 01:06:52.207
- Do you mind if we don't talk
about my girlfriend tonight?

01:06:52.209 --> 01:06:53.241
- Did you say

01:06:53.243 --> 01:06:55.543
that your name

01:06:55.545 --> 01:06:58.680
was chillin?

01:06:58.682 --> 01:07:01.249
- Dylan, this is captain Jack,

01:07:01.251 --> 01:07:03.051
he's our dd.

01:07:03.053 --> 01:07:04.386
- Is this guy fucking serious?

01:07:04.388 --> 01:07:05.553
He's your dd?

01:07:05.555 --> 01:07:07.122
- Designated drinker.

01:07:07.124 --> 01:07:08.323
- Ah.
- Yeah.

01:07:08.325 --> 01:07:09.724
- Gotcha.

01:07:09.726 --> 01:07:11.359
- Don't mind him,

01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:13.528
he has a couple of loose screws.

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:16.164
Plus he's like 35 and still
thinks he's in high school.

01:07:16.166 --> 01:07:17.766
- Alright, cool. Good
to know, thank you.

01:07:17.768 --> 01:07:19.768
Thanks for the warning.

01:07:23.672 --> 01:07:24.739
Is everything okay?

01:07:24.741 --> 01:07:25.807
- Fuck yeah!

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:30.612
- Um, you wanna get out of here?

01:07:30.614 --> 01:07:32.113
- I just got here.

01:07:32.115 --> 01:07:34.783
- Yeah, um, let's take a drive.

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:36.885
- Okay.

01:07:36.887 --> 01:07:37.719
- Yeah.

01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:38.953
- Cool.

01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:41.156
Can you bring the cup with you?

01:07:41.158 --> 01:07:42.757
- I'll drive you!

01:07:42.759 --> 01:07:44.426
I'll drive!

01:08:04.514 --> 01:08:05.514
- My boy.

01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:08.316
How we doing?

01:08:08.318 --> 01:08:09.318
- Good.

01:08:12.154 --> 01:08:13.488
Dons?

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:14.490
- Yeah?

01:08:16.992 --> 01:08:18.993
- What's a cunnilingus?

01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:24.732
- Sounds like some
kind of sea monster.

01:08:24.734 --> 01:08:26.634
- Yeah, a sea monster.

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:30.638
- It hurts, doesn't it?

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.740
- Feels like it's gonna explode.

01:08:32.742 --> 01:08:35.109
- That's good. That's good.

01:08:35.112 --> 01:08:38.011
That's what you want
it to do, explode.

01:08:38.014 --> 01:08:40.314
Explode all over the place.

01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:44.786
So, you're ready
for this or what?

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:47.689
Sure looks like your Johnson is.

01:08:47.691 --> 01:08:48.691
Hello.

01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:51.359
So here's what you're gonna do.

01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:54.362
You take mindy
into the back room.

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:57.098
That's where dons
lost his virginity

01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:59.200
when he was seven.

01:08:59.202 --> 01:09:00.234
- Seven?

01:09:00.237 --> 01:09:01.536
- Or 11.

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:04.171
Then you do what dons would do,

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.274
you take charge.

01:09:07.277 --> 01:09:09.176
What would dons do?

01:09:09.179 --> 01:09:10.712
- Eat a taco?

01:09:10.714 --> 01:09:12.447
- That's right. And?

01:09:13.916 --> 01:09:14.916
- Pound.

01:09:15.818 --> 01:09:16.818
- Pound.

01:09:17.853 --> 01:09:20.522
Good answer. Good answer, maxi!

01:09:21.724 --> 01:09:24.158
Tonight's the night, my boy.

01:09:24.161 --> 01:09:25.993
You're gonna do this!

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:29.564
I think you're ready. Now,

01:09:29.566 --> 01:09:33.100
you're gonna put that
blue powdered hard on,

01:09:33.103 --> 01:09:35.904
girthy motherfucker

01:09:35.906 --> 01:09:37.639
to good use

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.707
and you make dons proud.

01:09:40.542 --> 01:09:42.676
Go get her, maxi.

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:43.578
- Hey dons?

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:45.078
- Yeah?

01:09:45.081 --> 01:09:47.814
- Think you can call me Maximus.

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:51.519
- Yeah, Maximus.

01:10:10.307 --> 01:10:13.908
- Hi. I'd like to
order room service.

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:16.945
A cheeseburger, hold the meat.

01:10:16.947 --> 01:10:19.247
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah,

01:10:19.249 --> 01:10:20.481
hold the meat.

01:10:22.351 --> 01:10:23.585
Hold the meat.

01:10:24.687 --> 01:10:26.087
Take 30 minutes?

01:10:27.656 --> 01:10:29.157
Oh, um,

01:10:29.159 --> 01:10:30.091
our TV's a little fuzzy,

01:10:30.093 --> 01:10:33.261
can you send someone to fix it?

01:10:33.263 --> 01:10:34.263
Hello?

01:10:44.908 --> 01:10:46.774
Excuse me, oh maid?

01:10:46.776 --> 01:10:47.776
Oh maid?

01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:53.648
Fuck it.

01:11:05.629 --> 01:11:09.264
- Maintenance, having
trouble with your TV?

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:17.005
- Room service! No meat
just like you requested.

01:12:08.692 --> 01:12:12.360
- Most people who visit don't
get to see it like this.

01:12:12.362 --> 01:12:14.295
- Too many lights?

01:12:14.297 --> 01:12:15.630
- Too many boobs.

01:12:15.632 --> 01:12:16.632
- Ah.

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.334
My buddy Billy

01:12:19.336 --> 01:12:23.004
would say that there's no
such thing as too many boobs.

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:25.573
- Well he must be in heaven.

01:12:25.575 --> 01:12:28.643
- He is, he is.

01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:35.049
So why you come out here?

01:12:37.419 --> 01:12:38.419
- Those.

01:12:40.622 --> 01:12:42.323
- What do you think about?

01:12:42.325 --> 01:12:46.294
- When I was 15, my dad
died in a car accident.

01:12:47.129 --> 01:12:48.930
- I'm sorry.

01:12:48.932 --> 01:12:50.431
- And we lost it,

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:54.635
I mean everyone just lost it.

01:12:56.972 --> 01:12:58.606
And then one night,

01:12:58.608 --> 01:13:00.274
I came out here and

01:13:01.443 --> 01:13:03.344
they were still there.

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:08.216
I don't know, it's something
about the consistency.

01:13:08.218 --> 01:13:11.986
Makes things we see seem
less severe somehow.

01:13:15.157 --> 01:13:19.394
And I think things are just
as important as we make them.

01:13:22.498 --> 01:13:23.498
Your turn!

01:13:26.468 --> 01:13:28.503
- I play baseball.

01:13:28.505 --> 01:13:30.037
And my coach thinks
that I should always

01:13:30.039 --> 01:13:31.472
be hitting the
ball on the ground,

01:13:31.474 --> 01:13:33.741
like beat the throw to first.

01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:34.743
But

01:13:38.881 --> 01:13:42.150
I don't know, sometimes I just
want to take a fucking swing.

01:13:42.152 --> 01:13:43.017
You know?

01:13:43.019 --> 01:13:44.685
- Yeah.

01:13:44.687 --> 01:13:46.387
- And who knows
what could happen?

01:13:46.389 --> 01:13:47.588
I mean, yeah, I
might strike out,

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:48.956
but maybe I bomb it,
maybe I hit a home run.

01:13:48.958 --> 01:13:51.359
Maybe something new happens.

01:13:52.828 --> 01:13:54.562
I just wanna take a
fucking swing, you know?

01:13:54.564 --> 01:13:56.063
Strike out.

01:13:56.065 --> 01:13:59.934
- Yeah, like if I wanna
throw volleyballs at sad,

01:14:01.003 --> 01:14:03.704
lonely looking
guys, then I will.

01:14:03.706 --> 01:14:05.173
'Cause fuck it.

01:14:05.175 --> 01:14:06.407
- Yeah, exactly.

01:14:06.409 --> 01:14:09.610
- And I might strike
out, or maybe not.

01:14:09.612 --> 01:14:10.678
- I don't think you're
gonna strike out,

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.513
but you got a point, yeah.

01:14:12.515 --> 01:14:14.482
Fuck it.

01:14:14.484 --> 01:14:16.050
- Fuck it!
- Yeah.

01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:20.955
Fucking fuck it.

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:26.727
- Hey, do you wanna like
hang out with me this week?

01:14:26.729 --> 01:14:27.895
Me and my friends,

01:14:27.897 --> 01:14:31.199
we have like these
spring break traditions.

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:35.203
It always ends in
a big camping trip,

01:14:37.105 --> 01:14:40.074
campfire, s'mores,
the whole thing.

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:43.010
- Yeah, I like s'mores.

01:14:43.012 --> 01:14:43.945
- Yeah?

01:14:43.947 --> 01:14:48.049
- Yeah. Yeah, I mean fuck it.

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:51.720
- Mindy?

01:14:54.056 --> 01:14:57.124
Do you know what cunnilingus is?

01:14:57.126 --> 01:14:58.092
- Of course!

01:14:58.094 --> 01:14:59.627
Cunnilingus is an oral sex act

01:14:59.629 --> 01:15:02.497
performed by a person
on the female genitalia,

01:15:02.499 --> 01:15:07.034
the clitoris, vulva, or
other parts of the vagina.

01:15:07.036 --> 01:15:10.104
Basically, it's you
eating my pussy.

01:15:10.106 --> 01:15:12.507
Don't worry, I'll teach you.

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:14.342
- Oh shit.

01:15:15.577 --> 01:15:16.644
- Right now.

01:15:32.628 --> 01:15:33.694
- Dear lord,

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:36.764
or shaboobamon,

01:15:38.133 --> 01:15:42.637
creator of my favorite adult
website, titsamazing.Com.

01:15:42.639 --> 01:15:45.506
Whichever one of
you is listening,

01:15:45.508 --> 01:15:48.576
please give my two
tiny little balls

01:15:49.645 --> 01:15:52.146
the power of a mighty third

01:15:52.148 --> 01:15:55.249
so that I may tell Amber
how I feel about her.

01:15:55.251 --> 01:15:56.517
And if she requites my love,

01:15:56.519 --> 01:15:58.386
I promise to never look
at another boob again

01:15:58.388 --> 01:16:00.454
as long as I shall live.

01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:04.492
Okay, maybe like never.
Like one per day.

01:16:04.494 --> 01:16:05.560
Or per hour.

01:16:06.795 --> 01:16:08.696
That's real nice, okay?

01:16:08.698 --> 01:16:10.231
Oh!

01:16:10.233 --> 01:16:12.099
And pretty please

01:16:12.101 --> 01:16:13.367
just let me see Amber's nips

01:16:13.369 --> 01:16:15.903
just once before I
leave this world.

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:18.773
Just a little slip of
the nip is all I ask.

01:16:18.775 --> 01:16:19.775
A nip slip.

01:16:20.842 --> 01:16:22.510
The tip of the nip.

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:26.614
The tip of her
nip on that cliff.

01:16:26.616 --> 01:16:30.351
Shaboobamon, the last
part was more for you.

01:16:34.022 --> 01:16:35.990
- Good morning.

01:16:35.992 --> 01:16:38.059
- Good morning.

01:16:38.061 --> 01:16:39.794
- How are you doing?

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:44.699
Great.

01:16:44.701 --> 01:16:46.200
- What?

01:16:46.202 --> 01:16:48.302
- My phone is dead.

01:16:48.304 --> 01:16:51.005
- Good. You won't
need it this week.

01:16:51.007 --> 01:16:54.108
- Yeah, but I gotta let my
friends know what I'm doing.

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:57.111
- I'm sure they'll be fine.

01:16:57.113 --> 01:16:58.579
- I just don't know
if it's safe to be

01:16:58.581 --> 01:17:01.248
left alone out here though.

01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:03.117
- They're big boys, right?

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:06.053
- I guess, I guess.
I don't know.

01:17:06.055 --> 01:17:10.725
(" By mest)"

01:17:10.727 --> 01:17:11.792
Ah fuck it.

01:17:35.018 --> 01:17:36.484
(Moves into "take me away"

01:17:55.237 --> 01:17:56.871
- are you all alone?

01:17:56.873 --> 01:17:58.139
(")"

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:28.469
- What's this guy
doing on my course?

01:18:28.471 --> 01:18:29.937
(Moves into "take me away"

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:03.170
- mazel tov!

01:19:08.243 --> 01:19:09.343
- This is it.

01:19:10.445 --> 01:19:12.179
- This is it? This
is the surprise?

01:19:12.181 --> 01:19:13.814
- Mmmhmm, surprise!

01:19:15.117 --> 01:19:16.817
- It's a nice view.

01:19:16.819 --> 01:19:18.119
- Yeah.

01:19:18.121 --> 01:19:18.953
So you're ready?

01:19:18.955 --> 01:19:20.054
- What?

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.228
- You expect me to do that?

01:19:27.230 --> 01:19:28.629
- Hell yeah!

01:19:28.631 --> 01:19:30.331
You gotta surrender yourself
to life's challenges

01:19:30.333 --> 01:19:32.666
or you'll never experience it!

01:19:32.668 --> 01:19:33.668
- Okay. Uh.

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:36.837
Alright. Come on.

01:19:36.839 --> 01:19:37.905
Oh shit!

01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:44.145
Oh!

01:19:45.648 --> 01:19:47.381
That was awesome.

01:19:47.383 --> 01:19:48.716
I can't believe I did that.

01:19:48.718 --> 01:19:50.017
- It was amazing, right?

01:19:50.019 --> 01:19:52.486
- Yeah, yeah. You're amazing.

01:19:58.361 --> 01:19:59.426
Where he go?

01:20:00.996 --> 01:20:02.563
He was with us the whole time?

01:20:02.565 --> 01:20:03.764
- Yeah.

01:20:03.766 --> 01:20:06.834
- Oh, oh!

01:20:45.708 --> 01:20:49.577
- Nice! Nice captain
Jack, that was awesome.

01:20:49.579 --> 01:20:52.379
- So you're leaving
soon, I hope?

01:20:53.615 --> 01:20:56.317
You had fun at least, right?

01:20:56.319 --> 01:20:57.319
- Yeah, uh,

01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:00.421
yeah I'm leaving in the
next couple of days.

01:21:00.423 --> 01:21:02.756
But I don't really want to.

01:21:04.326 --> 01:21:05.893
It's been amazing.

01:21:06.995 --> 01:21:08.929
- Yeah, I heard it
rains a lot in Oregon.

01:21:08.931 --> 01:21:10.397
That must suck.

01:21:10.399 --> 01:21:11.165
- Hey guys, what's going on?

01:21:11.167 --> 01:21:12.167
- Jeff!

01:21:13.602 --> 01:21:14.768
Um, this is...

01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:18.639
- I'm Jeff, and you are?

01:21:18.641 --> 01:21:21.976
- This is Dylan, he's
from out of town.

01:21:28.416 --> 01:21:31.018
- You're gonna
treat me like this?

01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:32.686
This is what I get?

01:21:33.955 --> 01:21:35.923
This is what I deserve.

01:21:36.758 --> 01:21:38.325
- Jeff, come here.

01:21:46.034 --> 01:21:47.434
Look, it's okay.

01:21:48.236 --> 01:21:49.637
No need to freak out, okay?

01:21:49.639 --> 01:21:52.539
I'm gonna be getting
some friends.

01:22:02.217 --> 01:22:03.517
- Everything okay?

01:22:03.519 --> 01:22:06.086
- "Is everything okay?"

01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:07.354
- I just said that.

01:22:07.356 --> 01:22:09.123
- "I just said that."

01:22:09.125 --> 01:22:09.924
- Are you serious?

01:22:09.926 --> 01:22:10.858
- "Are you serious?"

01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:12.593
Hey, why don't you beer me bro?

01:22:12.595 --> 01:22:14.094
- Look everyone, I'm
in the fourth grade.

01:22:14.096 --> 01:22:16.697
- "Look everybody, I'm
in the fourth grade."

01:22:16.699 --> 01:22:17.898
- Dylan.

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:18.900
- What?

01:22:23.305 --> 01:22:24.371
- I'm sorry.

01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:28.275
I'm sorry.

01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:29.910
- It's okay. Come here.

01:22:29.912 --> 01:22:32.579
It's okay, it's not your fault.

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:35.983
- This is a touching song

01:22:35.985 --> 01:22:37.785
that will touch your hearts

01:22:37.787 --> 01:22:40.521
the way my dad used to touch me.

01:23:20.696 --> 01:23:24.031
- Will you please say something?

01:23:24.033 --> 01:23:26.400
- Yeah, thanks for the ride.

01:23:26.402 --> 01:23:28.469
- It's not what you
think, okay? He's my b...

01:23:28.471 --> 01:23:30.637
- what do you want me to say?

01:23:30.639 --> 01:23:31.572
What? That I like you?

01:23:31.574 --> 01:23:32.973
That I really, really like you?

01:23:32.975 --> 01:23:34.875
That I had an amazing
time with you this week

01:23:34.877 --> 01:23:36.777
for the first time in,

01:23:37.812 --> 01:23:39.947
you know what, fuck it.

01:23:39.949 --> 01:23:41.348
- Dylan, wait!

01:24:11.279 --> 01:24:12.513
- Jesus, man!

01:24:12.515 --> 01:24:14.848
What the fuck have you
been doing in here?

01:24:14.850 --> 01:24:17.518
Looks like someone's been
partying a little bit, huh?

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:19.586
- Oh yeah. Been
partying, alright.

01:24:19.588 --> 01:24:20.854
Where the fuck have you been?

01:24:20.856 --> 01:24:22.356
You know what? I
don't even wanna know.

01:24:22.358 --> 01:24:24.391
You were probably out boning
that hot little college chick

01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:26.060
while I'm in here with
a giant loner boner

01:24:26.062 --> 01:24:28.362
because Amber's off with some
hashtag douchebag muscle head

01:24:28.364 --> 01:24:31.198
who wears a straight billed hat!

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:34.401
- I'm sorry man.
Alright, that sucks.

01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:35.969
- Yeah, it fucking sucks.

01:24:35.971 --> 01:24:37.371
I mean you and
maxi just left me.

01:24:37.373 --> 01:24:38.472
I don't even know where he is!

01:24:38.474 --> 01:24:39.673
He's probably dead!

01:24:39.675 --> 01:24:41.208
The backyard beauty
is just gone,

01:24:41.210 --> 01:24:42.376
don't ask.

01:24:42.378 --> 01:24:45.212
And I could've really
used the support

01:24:45.214 --> 01:24:46.780
of my best friend.

01:24:46.782 --> 01:24:48.515
- I texted you, letting
you know what I was doing.

01:24:48.517 --> 01:24:50.084
I thought that you
would be happy for me.

01:24:50.086 --> 01:24:51.919
- Yeah, never received
any text from you

01:24:51.921 --> 01:24:54.655
and I'm just so happy for you.

01:24:54.657 --> 01:24:56.156
You know what?

01:24:56.158 --> 01:24:57.091
I'm gonna go try and find our
most likely dead best friend

01:24:57.093 --> 01:24:59.393
and get us the fuck outta here.

01:25:03.498 --> 01:25:05.132
- That's the bathroom.

01:25:05.134 --> 01:25:08.135
- I had to take a
shit but I can't!

01:25:09.871 --> 01:25:12.673
You frustrate the
shit out of me!

01:25:24.419 --> 01:25:27.221
- So maxi wrote us a note.

01:25:27.223 --> 01:25:29.790
Found it under the pizza box.

01:25:29.792 --> 01:25:32.092
It says "hey guys,
I'm losing it,"

01:25:32.094 --> 01:25:35.395
exclamation mark,
signed Maximus, xoxo.

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:39.633
Think we should be worried?

01:25:39.635 --> 01:25:41.135
- He's losing it?

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:45.472
Man he lost it a long time ago.

01:25:46.574 --> 01:25:47.774
Called the sheriff's office

01:25:47.776 --> 01:25:49.776
but the girl there
was kind of a nut job.

01:25:49.778 --> 01:25:51.478
- Look, I'm sure he'll turn
up sooner or later, alright?

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:53.080
He added a p.S.

01:25:53.082 --> 01:25:55.516
"I got you guys a little
something-something.

01:25:55.518 --> 01:25:58.886
"I hid them in the closet,"
with another exclamation mark.

01:25:58.888 --> 01:26:00.554
- Of course he hid
it in the closet.

01:26:00.556 --> 01:26:01.796
He hides himself in the closet.

01:26:02.691 --> 01:26:04.224
Such a thoughtful virgin.

01:26:04.226 --> 01:26:05.226
- Yeah.

01:26:08.196 --> 01:26:12.366
So it turns out that the
freshman has a boyfriend.

01:26:14.936 --> 01:26:16.003
- Shit, man!

01:26:17.539 --> 01:26:20.440
- Look, I'm sorry I
left you behind alright?

01:26:20.442 --> 01:26:23.277
I shouldn't have done that.

01:26:23.279 --> 01:26:25.979
I don't know, I guess
I suck like Katy.

01:26:25.981 --> 01:26:27.047
Sorry, lick.

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:29.016
- You do.

01:26:30.318 --> 01:26:31.318
You do.

01:26:32.787 --> 01:26:33.787
- I know.

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:35.856
I know.

01:26:42.297 --> 01:26:43.764
- Damn,

01:26:43.766 --> 01:26:47.935
I didn't have the balls to
be the man that she deserves.

01:26:49.571 --> 01:26:51.405
- No, fuck that man.

01:26:51.407 --> 01:26:52.839
Alright? That's not how
we're gonna go out, alright?

01:26:52.841 --> 01:26:54.174
We're gonna go back to town

01:26:54.176 --> 01:26:55.375
and we're not gonna leave

01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:57.911
until you tell Amber
how you feel about here.

01:26:57.913 --> 01:26:59.379
Alright? Look.

01:26:59.381 --> 01:27:00.714
When everyone's walking
into first period, alright?

01:27:00.716 --> 01:27:01.715
When everyone's
walking into school,

01:27:01.717 --> 01:27:02.649
who's the first person they hear

01:27:02.651 --> 01:27:05.085
cheering them up on the radio?

01:27:05.087 --> 01:27:07.120
You, right? This guy!

01:27:07.122 --> 01:27:09.289
This little face,
right here! Huh?

01:27:09.291 --> 01:27:10.390
When you didn't wanna
do the same thing

01:27:10.392 --> 01:27:11.925
for every spring break

01:27:11.927 --> 01:27:15.295
and you decided to mastermind
this whole spring bro-cation,

01:27:15.297 --> 01:27:16.830
who was the one who got
me and maxi out here

01:27:16.832 --> 01:27:20.000
and got me out of town when I
was upset with my girlfriend?

01:27:20.002 --> 01:27:22.135
Billy! Billy, Jesus
fucking Christ!

01:27:22.137 --> 01:27:24.504
Why are you still
carrying those around?

01:27:24.506 --> 01:27:26.506
Whatever, that's besides
the point alright?

01:27:26.508 --> 01:27:28.342
When Amber walks
into biology class

01:27:28.344 --> 01:27:30.143
and she wants to laugh
and have a good time

01:27:30.145 --> 01:27:32.646
'cause she sit next to you?

01:27:32.648 --> 01:27:33.880
- Biology Billy.

01:27:33.882 --> 01:27:35.015
- Biology fucking
Billy! Exactly!

01:27:35.017 --> 01:27:36.650
That's what I'm
talking about, alright?

01:27:36.652 --> 01:27:39.019
So enough with this
procrasterbating in our hotel room,

01:27:39.021 --> 01:27:40.821
which I've never seen before,

01:27:40.823 --> 01:27:42.222
and you should check that out.

01:27:42.224 --> 01:27:43.423
We're gonna go back out there

01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:44.358
and we're gonna start
this bro-cation up

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.126
like we intended to, alright?

01:27:46.128 --> 01:27:47.694
The way we started
to. Are you with me?

01:27:47.696 --> 01:27:48.528
Come on man, don't...

01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:49.863
- I forgive you!

01:27:49.865 --> 01:27:50.865
- Yes! Yes!

01:27:51.699 --> 01:27:54.368
He's back on the team! Alright!

01:27:56.170 --> 01:27:58.405
Are those your balls
in my bellybutton?

01:27:58.407 --> 01:27:59.640
- Yes they are.

01:28:47.188 --> 01:28:50.624
- So how do you plan
on finding Amber?

01:28:50.626 --> 01:28:53.560
- My bone-ar, Dylan. My bone-ar.

01:28:53.562 --> 01:28:54.895
- Alright, I forgot.

01:28:54.897 --> 01:28:56.630
So now you just gotta
follow that shit, right?

01:28:56.632 --> 01:28:58.598
- Yeah. I will.

01:28:58.600 --> 01:28:59.600
I will...

01:29:00.735 --> 01:29:01.568
Dude.

01:29:01.570 --> 01:29:02.836
- What?

01:29:02.838 --> 01:29:04.204
- No, don't sit
down. Don't sit down.

01:29:04.206 --> 01:29:05.138
No no no no.

01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:06.373
- Just take my shoes off.

01:29:06.375 --> 01:29:07.774
- Don't you wanna
go to the party?

01:29:07.776 --> 01:29:09.242
- Hey you!

01:29:09.244 --> 01:29:11.278
Get your damn
hands off her, man!

01:29:13.015 --> 01:29:14.815
- That's a good bttf reference,

01:29:14.817 --> 01:29:16.550
it's a pretty good movie.

01:29:16.552 --> 01:29:20.220
- Stop being such a creepy
stalker ex-boyfriend.

01:29:20.222 --> 01:29:21.555
You need to get over me.

01:29:21.557 --> 01:29:23.357
I'm with the dj now.

01:29:23.359 --> 01:29:24.558
- I didn't follow you out here.

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:27.761
- I am way too pretty for you!

01:29:33.434 --> 01:29:36.069
Look what you made me do!

01:29:36.071 --> 01:29:38.739
- I'll leave you alone.

01:29:38.741 --> 01:29:41.508
- That's right. Walk away dog.

01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:43.677
- Alright, I will
walk away, snoop.

01:29:43.679 --> 01:29:44.945
- Hey here,

01:29:44.947 --> 01:29:47.147
let me help you out with this.

01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:48.081
- No, don't. Seriously?

01:29:48.083 --> 01:29:49.916
No.

01:29:49.918 --> 01:29:51.318
That's fucking gross, man.

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:53.320
- Yeah, it's gross.

01:29:53.322 --> 01:29:54.254
- Alright guys, it's time to go.

01:29:54.256 --> 01:29:55.322
- What are you doing?

01:29:55.324 --> 01:29:56.490
- Come on.

01:29:56.492 --> 01:29:57.924
- What are you
doing? No, stop it!

01:29:57.926 --> 01:29:58.759
- I'm dj Tanner, man!

01:29:58.761 --> 01:29:59.860
You don't see my banner?

01:29:59.862 --> 01:30:00.694
- Dilly, save me!

01:30:00.696 --> 01:30:01.795
I'll lick your dick!

01:30:01.797 --> 01:30:03.597
Dilly, I'll do it. I'll lick it.

01:30:03.599 --> 01:30:06.266
I'll lick the whole thing!

01:30:06.268 --> 01:30:07.501
Dilly!

01:30:07.503 --> 01:30:10.704
- Welp, that took
care of her huh?

01:30:10.706 --> 01:30:11.705
- I love you, man.

01:30:11.707 --> 01:30:14.074
- Hey, just doing our jobs.

01:30:14.076 --> 01:30:15.609
As chaperons.

01:30:15.611 --> 01:30:16.843
- That's true!

01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:22.215
- Hey! It's biology Billy!

01:30:24.485 --> 01:30:25.952
- Michelle?

01:30:25.954 --> 01:30:28.889
- What are you doing here?

01:30:28.891 --> 01:30:31.558
- Leopard boat? Havasu sleeper?

01:30:32.994 --> 01:30:36.196
- I love leopards.

01:30:36.198 --> 01:30:39.065
- Okay, have you
seen Amber anywhere?

01:30:39.067 --> 01:30:41.601
- Oh yeah! She was
asking about you!

01:30:41.603 --> 01:30:42.669
Here, come with me!

01:30:42.671 --> 01:30:43.703
- She was?

01:30:43.705 --> 01:30:44.971
- Yeah, silly!

01:30:44.973 --> 01:30:47.674
We're about to go watch
the dj spin his laptop.

01:30:47.676 --> 01:30:49.276
If you hurry, you can!

01:30:49.278 --> 01:30:50.911
- I can?

01:30:50.913 --> 01:30:53.313
- Yes, Billy! Just come!

01:30:53.315 --> 01:30:54.381
Come!

01:30:54.383 --> 01:30:56.183
- I'm coming!

01:30:56.185 --> 01:30:57.083
- Hello?

01:30:57.085 --> 01:30:58.351
- Hello?

01:30:59.922 --> 01:31:01.221
- Hello? Hello?

01:31:01.223 --> 01:31:03.089
- Yeah hello. Is this
the sheriff's station?

01:31:03.091 --> 01:31:04.324
- Hey!

01:31:07.595 --> 01:31:09.329
- What are you doing here?

01:31:09.331 --> 01:31:11.164
- I need a chance to explain.

01:31:11.166 --> 01:31:12.799
- You don't have to explain.

01:31:12.801 --> 01:31:14.701
Okay? You don't owe
me an explanation.

01:31:14.703 --> 01:31:15.969
It was my fault, alright?

01:31:15.971 --> 01:31:18.104
I knew, I knew that
something was wrong,

01:31:18.106 --> 01:31:19.773
and I just went along
with it anyway, okay?

01:31:19.775 --> 01:31:20.974
So you don't owe me anything.

01:31:20.976 --> 01:31:23.376
I just don't know
what you want from me.

01:31:23.378 --> 01:31:24.378
- Wow.

01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:26.780
Okay.

01:31:31.619 --> 01:31:34.788
Remember when I told you
about how my dad died?

01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:36.623
- It was a car crash, right?

01:31:36.625 --> 01:31:39.059
- Jeff was the one
driving the car.

01:31:39.061 --> 01:31:40.260
It might be a little messed up,

01:31:40.262 --> 01:31:43.363
but he is my brother,
not my boyfriend.

01:31:44.198 --> 01:31:45.432
- Sarah, wait.

01:31:48.202 --> 01:31:51.872
Shit man!

01:31:51.874 --> 01:31:55.108
- Looks like you owe
Sarah an apology.

01:31:56.644 --> 01:31:57.644
- I know.

01:31:58.713 --> 01:32:01.982
- Get out of here,
man. Go and find her!

01:32:01.984 --> 01:32:02.816
- I will!

01:32:02.818 --> 01:32:04.217
- And take this.

01:32:07.522 --> 01:32:08.355
- It's apple juice?

01:32:08.357 --> 01:32:09.923
- Orange juice.

01:32:09.925 --> 01:32:11.358
And it's freshly squeezed.

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:13.927
- Freshly squeezed and organic.

01:32:13.929 --> 01:32:15.028
- And organic.

01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:16.030
- I get it.

01:32:17.632 --> 01:32:20.133
- Hey guys! Look,
it's biology Billy!

01:32:20.135 --> 01:32:21.368
- Oh hey, Billy!

01:32:21.370 --> 01:32:23.003
- Oh look! It's
our little buddy!

01:32:23.005 --> 01:32:24.237
Buddy the elf!

01:32:24.239 --> 01:32:26.506
Yeah, we're glad
to see you. Yeah!

01:32:26.508 --> 01:32:30.143
Yo, the cashtag is
staying for the playing.

01:32:31.479 --> 01:32:34.748
- Hey, you can't call
a small person an elf!

01:32:34.750 --> 01:32:36.650
This isn't the north pole.

01:32:36.652 --> 01:32:38.752
- Oh no, it is the
north pole, Michelle.

01:32:38.754 --> 01:32:40.420
- Hey cashtag?

01:32:40.422 --> 01:32:41.388
Can I talk to you over
there for a second?

01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:42.622
Just a little walk and talk man?

01:32:42.624 --> 01:32:43.857
- Alright?

01:32:43.859 --> 01:32:44.791
- Cool. I really
like necklace man.

01:32:44.793 --> 01:32:46.059
- Cool. Thank you.

01:32:46.061 --> 01:32:47.260
- Alright.

01:32:47.262 --> 01:32:48.194
- You gotta help us
get away from this guy.

01:32:48.196 --> 01:32:48.862
- I'm trying.
- Cashtag?

01:32:48.864 --> 01:32:49.796
- He's so weird.

01:32:49.798 --> 01:32:52.465
- Oh yeah, nice try pussypants.

01:32:52.467 --> 01:32:54.935
- Who are you calling
pussypants, pussypants!

01:32:54.937 --> 01:32:56.169
- Oh! Hashtag!

01:32:57.238 --> 01:32:58.505
Bitch fell!

01:32:58.507 --> 01:33:00.340
- Why don't you hashtag this?

01:33:02.811 --> 01:33:07.047
- Hashtag, broke dick.

01:33:09.684 --> 01:33:12.052
- Hashtag, say hi to
your vagina for me.

01:33:15.090 --> 01:33:16.022
I'm so sorry, Lauren.

01:33:16.024 --> 01:33:17.357
- It's all good.

01:33:17.359 --> 01:33:19.292
- Hashtag biology Billy, bitch!

01:33:19.294 --> 01:33:20.827
- Biology, bitch!

01:33:20.829 --> 01:33:22.796
- Hashtag, why you
gotta be such a dick?

01:33:22.798 --> 01:33:23.630
Just be cool!

01:33:23.632 --> 01:33:24.564
- No dick cool!

01:33:24.566 --> 01:33:26.299
- Hashtag, I love Amber Andrews!

01:33:26.301 --> 01:33:27.934
- I love Amber Andrews!

01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:33.140
Amber,

01:33:34.742 --> 01:33:37.911
I know I don't have a super
cool name like cashtag,

01:33:37.913 --> 01:33:40.614
or an even cooler
necklace to back it up.

01:33:40.616 --> 01:33:41.548
But I've been in love with you

01:33:41.550 --> 01:33:44.417
for as long as I can remember.

01:33:44.419 --> 01:33:45.952
And I promised myself
I wouldn't leave here

01:33:45.954 --> 01:33:48.088
without telling you how...

01:33:50.424 --> 01:33:52.025
- you should've found your balls

01:33:52.027 --> 01:33:53.426
a long time ago.

01:33:54.762 --> 01:33:56.563
- I should've. I...

01:33:56.565 --> 01:33:57.397
- don't talk.

01:33:57.399 --> 01:33:58.399
- Okay.

01:34:12.713 --> 01:34:13.713
- So.

01:34:18.619 --> 01:34:19.919
I'm an asshole.

01:34:21.455 --> 01:34:23.690
- Yeah, you're an asshole.

01:34:25.493 --> 01:34:27.193
- I'm sorry that I didn't
let you explain yourself.

01:34:27.195 --> 01:34:28.195
I guess,

01:34:29.463 --> 01:34:32.198
I was dealing with my own stuff.

01:34:33.434 --> 01:34:34.434
But

01:34:37.104 --> 01:34:40.273
I had an amazing time
with you this week

01:34:40.275 --> 01:34:44.811
and I know that I don't
deserve anything from you,

01:34:44.813 --> 01:34:46.112
and I know that

01:34:47.281 --> 01:34:48.682
you can say no,

01:34:48.684 --> 01:34:49.684
but

01:34:51.619 --> 01:34:55.855
is there any chance I can
maybe get another shot at it?

01:34:58.659 --> 01:35:00.026
- Yeah.

01:35:00.028 --> 01:35:01.528
I mean,

01:35:01.530 --> 01:35:03.096
it's my fault too.

01:35:04.498 --> 01:35:08.968
I love my brother and I
would do anything for him but

01:35:08.970 --> 01:35:13.873
I don't handle him the
right way most of the time.

01:35:13.875 --> 01:35:16.676
And that's not
fair to him or me.

01:35:17.812 --> 01:35:21.314
So I'm sorry too.

01:35:25.052 --> 01:35:27.087
I like you Dylan.

01:35:27.089 --> 01:35:29.656
- I'm gonna kiss you
now. Is that okay?

01:35:29.658 --> 01:35:30.824
- Yes please.

01:35:46.907 --> 01:35:48.708
- Hi. How's it going?

01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:50.543
- Hi.

01:35:50.545 --> 01:35:52.645
- Can you help us find a friend?

01:35:52.647 --> 01:35:54.280
- Does he work here?

01:35:54.282 --> 01:35:55.448
- Uh, well he's not a cop.

01:35:55.450 --> 01:35:57.751
- Did you try to call him?

01:35:57.753 --> 01:36:00.053
- Oh he left his cell
phone in our hotel room

01:36:00.055 --> 01:36:02.655
so he doesn't have
his phone on him.

01:36:02.657 --> 01:36:05.291
- Did you call him
with his phone?

01:36:05.293 --> 01:36:08.528
- Did I call him
with his own phone?

01:36:08.530 --> 01:36:10.163
- Or you can call
him with your phone.

01:36:10.165 --> 01:36:11.664
- Look, I'm sorry.

01:36:11.666 --> 01:36:13.166
We seem to have gotten off
on the wrong foot here.

01:36:13.168 --> 01:36:14.534
Could you just ask one of
your colleagues in the back

01:36:14.536 --> 01:36:17.203
if they can help us
find our friend please?

01:36:17.205 --> 01:36:18.205
- No!

01:36:19.573 --> 01:36:22.475
Please fill out
this form, please.

01:36:26.347 --> 01:36:27.347
- Okay.

01:36:33.788 --> 01:36:34.854
Here you go.

01:36:37.191 --> 01:36:39.826
We got a Max seapad,

01:36:39.828 --> 01:36:42.929
age 18 from bend, Oregon.

01:36:42.931 --> 01:36:44.564
- Yeah, that's him.

01:36:46.367 --> 01:36:47.400
- Hey Manuel?

01:36:47.402 --> 01:36:48.735
- Yes, I'm back here.

01:36:48.737 --> 01:36:51.304
- Do you have a Max
seapad back there?

01:36:51.306 --> 01:36:53.173
- Oh, that is somebody's name?

01:36:53.175 --> 01:36:54.175
- Yeah.

01:36:55.777 --> 01:36:56.777
Yeah.

01:36:57.578 --> 01:36:58.578
- No.

01:36:58.580 --> 01:37:01.714
But we do have a couple of kids,

01:37:01.716 --> 01:37:05.118
still passed out in
their holding cages.

01:37:07.888 --> 01:37:09.255
- Captain Jack?

01:37:09.257 --> 01:37:10.456
- Wait,

01:37:10.458 --> 01:37:14.460
you know Tyrese Jackson?

01:37:15.529 --> 01:37:16.429
- Tyrese Jackson?

01:37:16.431 --> 01:37:17.297
- Who's Tyrese Jackson?

01:37:17.299 --> 01:37:18.932
- Aka captain Jack.

01:37:21.268 --> 01:37:22.235
- Did you know his name
was Tyrese Jackson?

01:37:22.237 --> 01:37:24.037
- Makes sense, Jack.

01:37:24.039 --> 01:37:26.606
- We used to be best friends.

01:37:26.608 --> 01:37:29.375
Now he don't
recognize me no more.

01:37:29.377 --> 01:37:31.678
So every now and then

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:34.113
I bring him into the station.

01:37:34.115 --> 01:37:35.248
And this way,

01:37:36.283 --> 01:37:40.520
I get to see an old

01:37:46.126 --> 01:37:47.760
pal of mine.

01:37:47.762 --> 01:37:50.763
- That's an interesting
story, Manuel!

01:37:50.765 --> 01:37:52.832
- Look, so there's no one
here named maxi or Max?

01:37:52.834 --> 01:37:56.369
- Well,

01:37:56.371 --> 01:37:57.503
I don't know.

01:37:59.039 --> 01:38:02.175
But there are some
people in these cades

01:38:02.177 --> 01:38:03.177
over there.

01:38:04.912 --> 01:38:05.912
- Katy?

01:38:05.914 --> 01:38:07.046
Is that you?

01:38:07.048 --> 01:38:08.514
- Dylan? Dilly!

01:38:08.516 --> 01:38:09.315
Dilly-boo!

01:38:09.317 --> 01:38:10.683
Oh you came back for me!

01:38:10.685 --> 01:38:13.019
I just knew you would!

01:38:13.021 --> 01:38:14.254
- I take it that
this is the infamous

01:38:14.256 --> 01:38:16.256
ex-girlfriend of yours?

01:38:16.258 --> 01:38:18.258
- Yeah, it is.

01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:19.592
- Yeah, it makes sense.

01:38:19.594 --> 01:38:21.427
- Who's this?

01:38:21.429 --> 01:38:22.262
- Glad you asked!

01:38:22.264 --> 01:38:23.663
Katy, this is Sarah.

01:38:24.499 --> 01:38:27.300
And Sarah is awesome.

01:38:27.302 --> 01:38:28.134
- What?

01:38:28.136 --> 01:38:29.535
- And you're not.

01:38:29.537 --> 01:38:32.772
You kinda suck, actually. So...

01:38:32.774 --> 01:38:35.742
- that's right. She does suck.

01:38:35.744 --> 01:38:37.277
Don't you Kathy?

01:38:37.279 --> 01:38:38.411
- It's Katy!

01:38:38.413 --> 01:38:41.214
- Actually she
doesn't suck, at all.

01:38:41.216 --> 01:38:43.249
And you'll realize
that sooner or later,

01:38:43.251 --> 01:38:45.251
so we're just gonna let
you get back to that.

01:38:45.253 --> 01:38:48.021
Kathy, great to see you again.

01:38:48.023 --> 01:38:49.689
Dj, have a good one.

01:38:49.691 --> 01:38:51.024

01:38:51.026 --> 01:38:52.425
Dilly?

01:38:52.427 --> 01:38:53.427
Dilly!

01:38:56.130 --> 01:38:57.030
- Ooh, is that a truck?

01:38:57.032 --> 01:38:58.064
- Any luck?

01:38:58.066 --> 01:39:01.267
- No, no maxi.

01:39:01.269 --> 01:39:03.636
But we did find someone

01:39:03.638 --> 01:39:04.470
Thanks to you.

01:39:04.472 --> 01:39:05.638

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:12.879
I gotta get this back to
the Peterson, you know?

01:39:12.881 --> 01:39:14.480
Where's that virgin?

01:39:18.752 --> 01:39:22.055

fucking time machine?

01:39:23.624 --> 01:39:26.526

01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:46.879
Oh my god! We thought

01:39:46.881 --> 01:39:48.848

cunnilingus is now.

01:39:57.525 --> 01:39:59.625
And it is awesome.

01:39:59.627 --> 01:40:00.760

- Um, well I'm a little tired.

01:40:11.573 --> 01:40:14.407
Mad Maximus has

01:40:15.509 --> 01:40:16.743
- Dude, you left

01:40:16.745 --> 01:40:18.144

01:40:48.776 --> 01:40:51.277
You ready? Sorry we gotta

01:40:51.279 --> 01:40:53.780

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:25.144

01:41:26.281 --> 01:41:28.181

01:41:34.022 --> 01:41:37.590
"Dilly!" Hate when she
calls you that. Fuck.

01:41:38.759 --> 01:41:40.193

Guess whose beaver's

day of my life.

01:42:56.103 --> 01:42:58.304

01:43:02.010 --> 01:43:04.310
Yeah, don't talk Dylan.

01:43:04.312 --> 01:43:06.445

01:43:43.083 --> 01:43:45.051
Who are you boys?

01:43:45.053 --> 01:43:48.054
And what do you want with me?

01:43:48.056 --> 01:43:50.256
- We're the guys who
rented your boat, man.

01:43:50.258 --> 01:43:51.258
- Bullshit.

01:43:52.526 --> 01:43:54.427
I never forget a name,

01:43:55.362 --> 01:43:56.362

But we can't seem to locate...

01:44:03.504 --> 01:44:06.305

01:44:08.276 --> 01:44:09.742
Here, take my business card.

01:44:09.744 --> 01:44:13.012

Good luck with the website.

01:44:29.597 --> 01:44:31.230
That will help you a lot.

01:44:31.232 --> 01:44:32.431

Fuck, so nasty.

01:45:49.376 --> 01:45:51.777
- You sound like a raptor.

01:45:51.779 --> 01:45:53.079
- Raptors are cool.

01:45:53.081 --> 01:45:54.914

01:46:06.327 --> 01:46:08.728
- That's nice. See
he put the lip over.

01:46:08.730 --> 01:46:09.962
And the tongue.

01:46:09.964 --> 01:46:10.930
- What are you, a
boxing commentator?

01:46:10.932 --> 01:46:12.598
- Yeah, it's nice.

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:13.532
Really like what he's doing.

01:46:13.534 --> 01:46:14.834
- Can we just enjoy this?

01:46:14.836 --> 01:46:15.935
We don't have to talk about it.

01:46:15.937 --> 01:46:17.136
- Fine.

01:46:17.138 --> 01:46:19.872
- "So my ship is over

01:46:19.874 --> 01:46:21.140
"You wanna, maybe, I don't know,"

01:46:21.142 --> 01:46:23.109
"go get some food
or something or?"

01:46:23.111 --> 01:46:24.577
- "Absolutely.

01:46:24.579 --> 01:46:26.879
"I got my first boner

Is your boy messing

01:46:31.786 --> 01:46:33.219
- No, they're just talking.

01:46:33.221 --> 01:46:34.220
- They're just chatting, huh?

01:46:34.222 --> 01:46:35.621
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:46:35.623 --> 01:46:38.391
Is there something on my feet?

01:46:38.393 --> 01:46:39.625
- Is that cum?

01:46:41.928 --> 01:46:43.462
- Goddamn it, it happened again.

01:46:43.464 --> 01:46:44.330
Fuck!

01:46:44.332 --> 01:46:45.564
- Can we do that again?

01:46:48.469 --> 01:46:50.403
- Hey remember!

01:46:50.405 --> 01:46:52.471
You're only as gay as
the guy giving you head.

01:46:52.473 --> 01:46:53.672
What are you, German u-boat man?

01:46:53.674 --> 01:46:56.976
You ever tongue punch
a fart box before?

01:47:08.588 --> 01:47:11.957
- Who gives a shit?
I eat pussy for breakfast.

01:47:11.959 --> 01:47:13.592
- You also eat kit kats?

01:47:13.594 --> 01:47:15.528
- Yeah, pussycat.

01:47:15.530 --> 01:47:17.229
- I'm sorry.

01:47:19.367 --> 01:47:21.801
- How you doing down

01:47:21.803 --> 01:47:25.104
You think Jeff janke
fucks like he directs?

01:47:25.106 --> 01:47:26.439
That'd be awesome.

01:47:31.946 --> 01:47:32.946
- Oh fuck.

01:47:34.649 --> 01:47:35.614
I did it the right way.

01:47:35.616 --> 01:47:38.317
Look how perfect this cone is!

01:47:38.319 --> 01:47:41.720
- That's where dons
lost his virginity.

01:47:41.722 --> 01:47:44.223
When I was eight!

01:47:44.225 --> 01:47:46.759
I'm just kidding. Am I?

01:47:46.761 --> 01:47:48.494
Youth group. Anyway.

01:47:49.529 --> 01:47:50.609
Fuck, that does make sense.

01:47:53.634 --> 01:47:54.633
- And cigarettes.

01:47:54.635 --> 01:47:57.603
- Pussy say a cat.

01:47:57.605 --> 01:48:00.439
- Would you like to see
some identification, dons?

01:48:00.441 --> 01:48:01.907
- No no no no no.

01:48:03.243 --> 01:48:06.312
You don't need to see
any identification, dons.

01:48:06.314 --> 01:48:07.146
- It's nice, isn't it?

01:48:07.148 --> 01:48:08.614
- It's very nice.

01:48:08.616 --> 01:48:10.483
- I think he would like to
see identification, right don?

01:48:10.485 --> 01:48:12.751
- It sucks when you make ponds
of cum in your bellybutton.

01:48:12.753 --> 01:48:14.453
- That's okay, I swim
around in that shit.

01:48:14.455 --> 01:48:15.654
- Alright.

01:48:15.656 --> 01:48:17.189
- I think we're
already in the door

01:48:17.191 --> 01:48:19.325
and we don't need to show
any identification, dons.

01:48:19.327 --> 01:48:20.526
- Maybe somebody
worked very hard

01:48:20.528 --> 01:48:21.861
on that identification, dons.

01:48:21.863 --> 01:48:22.761
- Maybe no one cares.

01:48:22.763 --> 01:48:23.596
- You wanna come too?

01:48:23.598 --> 01:48:24.530
- I wanna come.
