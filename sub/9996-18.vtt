00:01.600 --> 00:02.600
NEXT TELLER PLEASE

00:04.460 --> 00:05.350
I'm on a break.

00:05.660 --> 00:07.210
But we just opened.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.460
Good morning.

00:13.630 --> 00:14.860
Yes.

00:17.180 --> 00:18.190
Mr. Hitchens?

00:19.180 --> 00:20.820
Miss Boddicker, what is it now?

00:21.140 --> 00:23.150
I need to know if you've contacted anyone.

00:23.230 --> 00:25.010
I need to know if you've called the police.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.540
No, I have not contacted anyone.

00:27.540 --> 00:29.330
No, I have not called the police.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.360
But, Mr. Hitchens...

00:30.360 --> 00:31.400
But, Miss Boddicker,

00:31.400 --> 00:33.190
what would you have me say to them?

00:33.560 --> 00:35.020
"Hello, Police.

00:35.400 --> 00:38.310
"A woman who works in my bank "is convinced it's going to be robbed.

00:38.480 --> 00:40.210
"She doesn't know exactly what day.

00:40.210 --> 00:42.020
"She doesn't know exactly what time.

00:42.170 --> 00:43.990
"She won't tell me how she knows this.

00:43.990 --> 00:46.240
Just that the bank is going to be robbed"?

00:46.290 --> 00:47.640
But it is!

00:47.650 --> 00:51.640
By two men in hockey masks with shotguns.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.540
Why won't you believe me?

00:55.240 --> 00:58.149
Perhaps if you told me how you came to know all of this...

00:58.150 --> 00:59.390
But I can't.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.109
Good-bye, Miss Boddicker.

01:01.110 --> 01:03.060
And yes, please close the door.

01:10.570 --> 01:11.790
All right.

01:12.790 --> 01:13.860
I'll tell you.

01:14.260 --> 01:15.530
But you can't laugh.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.560
And you can't tell anyone else.

01:18.210 --> 01:20.710
Very well, Miss Boddicker, you have my word.

01:20.890 --> 01:22.390
You have to swear.

01:24.750 --> 01:25.810
I swear.

01:26.140 --> 01:27.220
I won't laugh.

01:27.960 --> 01:29.530
I won't tell anybody else.

01:33.210 --> 01:35.270
I saw it all in a dream.

01:37.310 --> 01:38.870
Excuse me?

01:38.920 --> 01:41.140
It came to me in a dream.

01:41.420 --> 01:42.840
Like that lady--

01:43.060 --> 01:44.970
the one that's always in the newspaper?

01:45.120 --> 01:46.870
The one that's always in the news?

01:47.510 --> 01:48.830
Allison Dubois?

01:53.460 --> 01:54.760
That's not nice.

01:55.730 --> 01:56.960
You swore.

01:57.410 --> 01:58.860
You're right.

01:59.260 --> 02:00.370
This will be better.

02:01.560 --> 02:05.360
Now I get to call the police and I get to tell them,

02:05.440 --> 02:08.740
"You've got to come down to my branch right now

02:08.919 --> 02:11.510
"and make sure no one with a hockey mask

02:11.510 --> 02:14.100
"or a shotgun walks inside.

02:14.530 --> 02:17.000
"Of course I know it's really going to happen.

02:17.260 --> 02:20.180
One of my tellers dreamed it."

02:22.460 --> 02:23.800
Everybody down on the ground!

02:23.800 --> 02:25.469
Faces down! Faces down!

02:25.470 --> 02:27.090
Behind the counter, let me see your hands!

02:27.850 --> 02:29.200
Come on, let me see those fingers.

02:32.470 --> 02:34.540
You, honey, fill that bag up.

02:35.100 --> 02:36.440
Or I'll blow his head off.

Will you guys stop that?

03:30.670 --> 03:32.200
I'm trying to digest.

03:32.350 --> 03:34.640
Come on, you're going to miss Daddy too, aren't you?

03:35.110 --> 03:36.460
Of course, we'll miss Daddy,

03:36.460 --> 03:38.670
but he'll be back Thursday night, right?

03:38.670 --> 03:39.950
Yeah.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.459
I leave on Tuesday morning,

03:41.460 --> 03:42.810
I'm back on Thursday night.

03:42.830 --> 03:45.580
I haven't even left yet, and I'm almost home already.

03:45.580 --> 03:47.780
So can I get some kisses?

03:48.190 --> 03:50.759
You-- no wild parties while I'm gone, okay?

03:50.760 --> 03:51.860
Okay.

03:59.670 --> 04:00.730
So, Dad...

04:01.420 --> 04:02.420
Yeah.

04:02.420 --> 04:04.320
I know that you're taking a cab to the airport,

04:04.320 --> 04:07.149
and it seems kind of silly that your car's just going to be

04:07.150 --> 04:08.920
sitting in the garage while you're gone.

04:09.400 --> 04:10.979
Where would you like it to sit?

04:10.980 --> 04:12.380
She'd like to sit in it.

04:12.530 --> 04:13.900
Preferably behind the wheel.

04:14.140 --> 04:15.429
I mean, if you give me the keys,

04:15.430 --> 04:18.119
I could help Mom and I could take Bridgette and Marie to school

04:18.130 --> 04:19.600
and go to the market, and...

04:19.670 --> 04:20.980
Ooh, that would be great.

04:24.430 --> 04:27.009
Okay, you gave me something to think about while I'm in San Diego,

04:27.010 --> 04:28.269
so, yeah, I'll think about that.

04:28.270 --> 04:29.690
Maybe next week, huh?

04:30.490 --> 04:32.030
Next week?

04:37.820 --> 04:40.100
No joy riding. No friends in the car.

04:40.410 --> 04:41.459
You take your sisters to school,

04:41.460 --> 04:43.190
and you do anything else that your mom might want, okay?

04:43.190 --> 04:44.340
And that's it.

04:46.100 --> 04:47.350
That's it. I promise.

04:50.300 --> 04:52.209
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

04:52.210 --> 04:54.000
- You be careful.
- Have a good trip.

04:57.630 --> 04:58.730
Will you walk me to the door?

04:59.910 --> 05:01.460
I get to pick the radio station.

05:01.520 --> 05:03.000
Yeah, you get to pick your nose.

05:03.730 --> 05:05.090
So how hard was that?

05:05.170 --> 05:06.260
Really hard.

05:09.090 --> 05:10.600
Good morning. Dr. Atwell's office.

05:14.870 --> 05:16.170
Hey. You made it.

05:18.180 --> 05:20.850
Yeah. Yeah, well, uh...

05:23.420 --> 05:25.650
I don't know, it turns out I was just down the block.

05:27.650 --> 05:28.720
I'm glad you're here.

05:29.740 --> 05:30.540
Lynn?

05:38.810 --> 05:40.180
Lynn, hello.

05:43.190 --> 05:44.889
Dr. Atwell, you've never met the baby's father.

05:44.890 --> 05:46.210
This is Lee Scanlon.

05:46.610 --> 05:48.090
Lee, nice to meet you.

05:48.720 --> 05:49.810
Congratulations.

05:50.640 --> 05:51.670
So...

05:53.020 --> 05:54.110
20 weeks.

05:55.700 --> 05:56.800
First ultrasound.

05:56.850 --> 05:57.880
So big question:

05:58.530 --> 05:59.990
Do we want to know the sex of the baby?

05:59.990 --> 06:01.450
- Yes. - No.

06:03.250 --> 06:04.440
I would.

06:07.810 --> 06:10.990
Well, I have a waiting room full of patients out there, folks.

06:11.890 --> 06:13.690
I mean, you two aren't married, are you?

06:14.790 --> 06:19.650
So I really, I have to defer to the mother.

06:20.160 --> 06:21.260
And you should defer to the mother.

06:21.260 --> 06:22.679
I'll just wait out in the hall.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.029
Lee, don't.

06:24.030 --> 06:25.420
I won't.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.129
And if you're one of those lucky commuters

06:30.130 --> 06:32.870
sitting in the middle of Bell Road and getting nowhere fast,

06:33.050 --> 06:36.740
you can thank two bank robbers who hit a Maricopa National branch today

06:37.020 --> 06:39.340
wearing hockey masks and brandishing shotguns.

06:44.960 --> 06:46.750
I mean if you're not responding to a bank robbery,

06:46.750 --> 06:47.980
what are you doing?

06:54.930 --> 06:56.170
Ruth Boddicker, right?

07:00.010 --> 07:01.080
Ruth?

07:02.720 --> 07:04.170
I think I know who you are.

07:04.820 --> 07:06.400
You're Allison Dubois, right?

07:06.570 --> 07:08.030
You're very perceptive.

07:08.190 --> 07:09.190
No.

07:09.580 --> 07:11.349
Um, just a bit of a news junkie.

07:11.350 --> 07:14.230
Oh, actually, I think you're more perceptive than you let on.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.510
Ruth, I had a dream about you last night.

07:18.700 --> 07:19.550
Me?

07:19.550 --> 07:22.720
In fact, my dream was about a dream you had.

07:23.280 --> 07:25.220
About this bank, about this robbery.

07:27.030 --> 07:29.030
Do you have any idea what I'm talking about?

07:29.030 --> 07:31.199
No, not really.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.300
Really? So you didn't dream about all this?

07:33.300 --> 07:36.560
Try to warn your boss that this robbery was going to happen?

07:39.370 --> 07:42.350
Ruth, I know you've been through an awful lot today.

07:43.110 --> 07:46.180
All kinds of people asking you all kinds of questions--

07:47.040 --> 07:51.390
but I have a funny feeling that you know exactly what I'm talking about.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.600
I also have a funny feeling that as time goes on,

07:56.340 --> 07:58.570
you're going to really want someone to talk to.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.500
Here's my cell number.

08:04.230 --> 08:05.440
Give me a call.

08:24.730 --> 08:26.320
Honey, I'm home.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.730
So what's it like?

08:29.060 --> 08:30.600
Well, I can hear the ocean.

08:30.770 --> 08:32.109
I can't see it, though.

08:32.110 --> 08:33.710
All I can see is the parking lot.

08:34.419 --> 08:36.219
And that's 'cause there's a light out there.

08:36.220 --> 08:37.919
I got off the plane, I went right to work.

08:37.919 --> 08:41.179
By the time I got here, it was dark, so I could be anywhere.

08:41.179 --> 08:42.589
You're very missed.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.039
I very miss you.

08:44.490 --> 08:45.940
Well, you're very missed back.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.350
Hey, honey, say hi to Daddy.

08:48.640 --> 08:49.780
Hi, Dad.

08:52.480 --> 08:57.380
And how did my car survive its first full day with a 16-year-old behind the wheel?

08:57.550 --> 08:59.259
Should I tell Daddy about the accident?

08:59.260 --> 09:00.260
Mom!

09:00.260 --> 09:01.750
He knows I'm kidding.

09:01.750 --> 09:02.850
You're kidding, right?

09:03.200 --> 09:04.900
TOP STORY "PSYCHIC" PREDICTED BANK ROBBERY

09:05.200 --> 09:07.240
Honey, honey, say hi to Daddy.

09:10.520 --> 09:13.600
...Ruth Boddicker, a long-time employee of Maricopa National Bank

09:13.600 --> 09:17.000
actually predicted this morning's daring bank heist.

09:17.010 --> 09:21.930
According to the bank's manager, Boddicker repeatedly warned that the robber was imminent.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.110
Is it true you predicted today's robbery?

09:24.530 --> 09:26.249
I really don't have anything to say.

09:26.250 --> 09:27.810
I just want to get to my car.

09:28.220 --> 09:29.729
- Hello? Is anyone there?
- God, poor woman.

09:29.730 --> 09:31.429
I know exactly how she feels.

09:31.430 --> 09:32.460
Allison?

09:38.920 --> 09:40.410
We made the TV news.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.880
That's nice.

09:43.660 --> 09:44.850
You know what they said?

09:46.030 --> 09:49.120
Hopefully we got away clean and they have no idea who we are.

09:50.310 --> 09:52.200
They did-- they said that.

09:54.150 --> 09:58.050
Then they said we got away with 300 grand.

10:01.970 --> 10:03.260
300 grand?

10:06.730 --> 10:08.030
That's insane.

10:08.310 --> 10:10.340
There's a little over $32,000 here.

10:15.790 --> 10:17.240
You want to look again?

10:19.180 --> 10:20.280
What are you doing?

10:20.910 --> 10:23.590
See, I was responsible for checking the door

10:23.620 --> 10:25.210
and watching the security guard.

10:26.140 --> 10:29.970
You were responsible for taking care of the cash.

10:31.550 --> 10:33.810
I want to see the other $270,000.

10:35.620 --> 10:37.320
I-I don't have it to show you.

10:39.020 --> 10:42.499
According to the news, you do.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.190
The news-- they're wrong.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.409
Look, maybe they put, like, an extra zero on it

10:47.410 --> 10:49.529
or added a comma or something.

10:49.530 --> 10:51.190
What?

10:51.200 --> 10:52.440
Will you...?

10:52.500 --> 10:54.470
You want left or right, hmm?

10:55.410 --> 10:56.570
It's your choice.

10:56.930 --> 10:58.280
Quit messing around.

10:58.880 --> 10:59.980
You're crazy.

11:01.090 --> 11:02.760
Stop. Don't do this.

11:05.720 --> 11:08.550
Just take mine if you want. Don't!

11:10.410 --> 11:11.410
Joe.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.220
Joe?

11:20.540 --> 11:22.669
It's not Joe. It's Ruth.

11:22.670 --> 11:23.800
Ruth from the bank.

11:24.410 --> 11:25.470
Ruth.

11:25.750 --> 11:27.809
I saw you on TV last night.

11:27.810 --> 11:28.849
What time is it?

11:28.850 --> 11:30.629
It's, uh, a little after 6:00.

11:30.630 --> 11:33.610
I'm sorry to bother you, but I needed to tell you.

11:34.130 --> 11:36.010
Everything you said to me at the bank yesterday?

11:36.290 --> 11:37.390
It's true.

11:37.720 --> 11:38.840
I do have dreams.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.129
I did dream about that robbery.

11:41.130 --> 11:42.930
And I had another dream tonight.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.480
Really? Me, too. Just now.

11:44.520 --> 11:45.600
Then you saw it?

11:46.010 --> 11:47.369
The one robber killed the other?

11:47.370 --> 11:48.990
Dumped his body in the park?

11:49.090 --> 11:51.390
What? No, no, no. My dream didn't go that far.

11:51.740 --> 11:54.410
Oh, Allison. It was horrible.

11:54.670 --> 11:56.290
I kept hoping it wasn't true.

11:56.900 --> 11:59.050
Did you... did you see any landmarks,

11:59.050 --> 12:00.269
maybe the name of the park?

12:00.270 --> 12:02.480
I could send the police there to look for the body.

12:02.630 --> 12:04.970
You don't have to. I already found it.

12:05.530 --> 12:09.330
In fact, I'm standing over it right now.

12:14.580 --> 12:16.070
Mommy had to go to work early,

12:16.180 --> 12:18.660
so I am driving you guys to school.

12:19.570 --> 12:21.289
Cool. I'm riding shotgun.

12:21.290 --> 12:22.460
What's shotgun?

12:23.520 --> 12:24.499
It's nothing.

12:24.500 --> 12:25.689
It's the, uh...

12:25.690 --> 12:28.759
empty seat beside the driver that's going to stay empty

12:28.760 --> 12:29.800
because Mom and Dad say

12:29.800 --> 12:33.520
that you guys have to be at least 12 years old to sit up there.

12:33.670 --> 12:34.710
So?

12:34.780 --> 12:37.930
So, that means that you can't sit up there.

12:39.330 --> 12:41.890
Wow, who died and made you queen of Car-ville?

12:49.490 --> 12:51.590
I've never been through anything like this before.

12:54.050 --> 12:55.330
All this blood.

12:55.670 --> 12:56.800
All this gore.

13:00.530 --> 13:01.770
I had that dream...

13:03.390 --> 13:05.220
and it was so vivid.

13:05.550 --> 13:08.450
And I thought, "Can this be true?"

13:09.310 --> 13:11.850
And I looked up Hoskins Park on the Internet,

13:12.200 --> 13:13.730
and there was such a place.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.260
So I got in my car and I drove out here...

13:17.640 --> 13:18.740
and there he was.

13:20.560 --> 13:23.520
I've never seen a real, live dead person before.

13:25.930 --> 13:26.870
Allison.

13:26.870 --> 13:29.050
I take it this is the woman you told me about,

13:29.050 --> 13:30.469
the woman who lead us here?

13:30.470 --> 13:32.469
Ruth Boddicker. This is my boss,

13:32.470 --> 13:34.390
District Attorney Manuel Devalos.

13:36.910 --> 13:38.329
It's a great pleasure to meet you, sir.

13:38.330 --> 13:41.450
And you, Miss Boddicker. I read about you in the papers this morning.

13:42.320 --> 13:45.560
Am I understanding correctly that both of you had dreams

13:45.560 --> 13:48.700
in which you saw the face of whoever it was who killed this man?

13:51.790 --> 13:53.449
Well, then, not to take up any more of your time,

13:53.450 --> 13:54.909
but it would be extraordinarily helpful

13:54.910 --> 13:57.980
if I could get you together with a detective to give him a description.

13:57.980 --> 13:59.240
We could run our composite software

13:59.240 --> 14:01.120
and see if we could generate a sketch of the killer.

14:02.430 --> 14:05.140
I guess I was hoping I would show you where the dead body was

14:05.460 --> 14:06.970
and then that would be that.

14:08.950 --> 14:11.069
Miss Boddicker, I can't force you to give me a description.

14:11.070 --> 14:13.489
I can certainly get one from Mrs. Dubois here,

14:13.490 --> 14:17.340
but when it comes to identifying criminals, the more input, the better.

14:17.580 --> 14:19.250
It would only take about 20 minutes.

14:20.190 --> 14:22.070
Actually, you might find it fun.

14:24.640 --> 14:25.730
All right, then.

14:27.340 --> 14:28.380
I suppose.

14:29.590 --> 14:33.109
Wonderful, then. We'll see you at City Hall. Third floor, anytime this afternoon.

14:33.490 --> 14:34.630
I guess it's a date.

14:36.410 --> 14:37.510
Thank you.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.560
Who'd have imagined?

14:41.740 --> 14:44.120
Two psychics, no waiting. You want to get some breakfast?

14:49.040 --> 14:51.710
Okay. Everybody in their car seats?

14:51.710 --> 14:53.660
Everybody wearing their seatbelts?

14:53.660 --> 14:56.919
Aye, aye, Captain Pushy. Everyone's seated and strapped.

14:56.920 --> 14:58.690
Aye, aye, Captain Pushy.

15:00.700 --> 15:01.600
What?

15:01.570 --> 15:03.600
Okay, you're supposed to be helping me.

15:03.840 --> 15:06.420
What do you want me to do? She's all buckled in.

15:06.970 --> 15:10.160
Hey, did you notice if I locked the sliding glass door in the kitchen?

15:10.160 --> 15:11.730
Why? Was I supposed to?

15:13.450 --> 15:14.470
Okay, you know what?

15:14.620 --> 15:17.390
If we're late, I'm telling Mom that it was your fault.

15:20.010 --> 15:22.419
She thinks she's so great, just 'cause she can drive.

15:22.420 --> 15:24.480
- Yeah.
- Well, I can drive, too, you know.

15:24.750 --> 15:27.170
Remember the go-karts we went on last summer?

15:27.800 --> 15:28.520
No.

15:28.520 --> 15:29.680
Well, I do.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.460
It's easy.

15:37.150 --> 15:39.880
Yeah, this is no big deal at all.

15:40.600 --> 15:43.660
Watch. First thing you do is you take this big stick thing.

15:44.310 --> 15:45.420
That was easy.

15:45.810 --> 15:49.100
Then you take this other stick thing and you pull it over to "N."

15:49.940 --> 15:51.400
That stands for "Now."

15:54.320 --> 15:55.639
I don't see a stop button.

15:55.640 --> 15:57.199
Make it stop!

15:57.200 --> 15:58.450
Oh, no, oh, no.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.190
This is bad.

16:07.790 --> 16:09.160
That was fun.

16:25.410 --> 16:26.320
Lynn?

16:31.640 --> 16:33.369
I don't get it. You asked me to meet you for lunch.

16:33.370 --> 16:36.550
You, uh, give me an address and it's a baby store.

16:36.840 --> 16:39.770
I asked if you wanted to meet at lunch, not for lunch.

16:39.840 --> 16:41.210
I have to start ordering some things.

16:41.210 --> 16:43.400
It could take three months to get this stuff delivered.

16:44.220 --> 16:46.670
And I just felt funny picking everything without you.

16:47.250 --> 16:48.720
Well, go ahead. Pick it without me.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.489
I mean, what you like, I like.

16:50.490 --> 16:52.230
It's not like I'm going to be sleeping in it.

16:53.320 --> 16:54.409
I know you care.

16:54.410 --> 16:56.100
I know deep down, you care about all of it.

16:56.330 --> 16:57.550
You're not fooling me.

16:58.480 --> 16:59.710
Whatever you say.

17:01.510 --> 17:02.970
You want to hear the name I'm thinking about?

17:03.970 --> 17:06.140
No. You tell me the name, I'm going to know the sex.

17:06.530 --> 17:07.530
Lee.

17:07.900 --> 17:08.630
Yeah?

17:08.630 --> 17:10.650
No, that's the name. Lee.

17:10.890 --> 17:12.239
Lee, Lee, Lee.

17:12.240 --> 17:15.109
It works for a girl and it works for a boy. Lee.

17:16.280 --> 17:17.550
Don't do this.

17:17.710 --> 17:19.010
But I love the name Lee.

17:19.010 --> 17:20.079
I do.

17:23.369 --> 17:25.010
Look, whatever you buy is fine.

17:28.420 --> 17:29.430
See you at home.

17:56.100 --> 17:57.530
<i>Do you exchange foreign money?</i>

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Excuse me?

18:01.000 --> 18:03.700
You know, I got about 500 Mexican pesos here,

18:03.700 --> 18:06.200
and I was just wondering if I could swap it for American money.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.710
Sure. I can do that.

18:09.480 --> 18:10.510
All right.

18:12.180 --> 18:14.700
Hey. You tango?

18:16.400 --> 18:17.550
Is it Ruth?

18:19.350 --> 18:20.379
Well, it's a small world.

18:20.380 --> 18:22.950
I just got back from Mexico on a tango weekend.

18:23.160 --> 18:24.320
I'm really a beginner.

18:25.610 --> 18:27.010
I take lessons.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.310
Oh. That's my teacher.

18:30.660 --> 18:33.330
I dance over at the Shirley Karch Studio on Wednesday nights.

18:33.980 --> 18:36.300
It's fun there. I mean, you meet people.

18:37.180 --> 18:38.540
Maybe you should try it.

18:39.430 --> 18:41.220
Well, I don't know if I'm ready for that.

18:41.890 --> 18:43.090
You look ready to me.

18:48.450 --> 18:53.330
So... That comes to $32.33.

18:55.660 --> 18:58.080
All right. Thank you.

18:58.860 --> 19:01.410
And I'll be looking for you at the Shirley Karch Studios.

19:02.270 --> 19:03.680
Take it easy, Ruth.

19:08.530 --> 19:09.760
Yeah. Come in.

19:12.610 --> 19:15.750
Hi. Hope I'm not interrupting anything.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.340
Just gave the detectives my description.

19:19.710 --> 19:20.840
Of course.

19:21.360 --> 19:22.370
You were right.

19:22.830 --> 19:24.180
It was kind of fun.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.150
They said any time you were ready.

19:27.850 --> 19:30.100
Well, thank you. I'll be over soon.

19:31.730 --> 19:35.890
So, listen. I hope I didn't get you into any trouble this morning.

19:36.580 --> 19:37.730
Excuse me?

19:37.900 --> 19:40.460
Uh, I know you're the big psychic around here,

19:40.910 --> 19:44.780
and then here I go finding the body and everything.

19:45.180 --> 19:46.920
I hope I didn't make you look bad.

19:48.300 --> 19:49.409
Don't worry, Ruth.

19:49.410 --> 19:51.190
You're just keeping me on my toes.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.210
Okay, then.

19:52.310 --> 19:54.850
Guess if I have any more dreams, I'll just call you.

19:55.210 --> 19:56.520
Well, I'll be waiting.

19:58.550 --> 20:00.860
Oh! Oh, Ruth. The dead man.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.270
Jimmy... Jimmy Fleming.

20:04.110 --> 20:06.340
Are you sure you've never met him before?

20:08.210 --> 20:09.500
I don't think so.

20:10.010 --> 20:13.900
Maybe at the bank. He might have mentioned a mutual interest in tango lessons?

20:21.230 --> 20:22.710
Oh, my goodness.

20:23.190 --> 20:24.160
Yes.

20:24.160 --> 20:26.110
Of course I remember him now.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.670
But that would mean he was one of the men who robbed the bank.

20:31.580 --> 20:32.930
Pointed a gun at me.

20:34.530 --> 20:35.960
That nice man.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.460
Did this just come to you?

20:41.570 --> 20:43.710
God, you're good at this.

20:45.230 --> 20:47.020
How come we didn't realize it sooner?

20:48.450 --> 20:50.420
So many people come into the bank.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.590
Oh, I'm so sorry. It's my daughter.

20:56.600 --> 20:57.550
Don't worry.

20:57.550 --> 20:59.500
Allison, I have your number.

20:59.770 --> 21:02.880
If I have any more important dreams, I'll just call you.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Thank you.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.579
Hello? Hey, sweetie.

21:08.580 --> 21:10.460
Everybody home safe and sound?

21:11.220 --> 21:13.300
Yeah. Everyone's home from school.

21:13.300 --> 21:14.680
Safe and sound.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.960
But Bridgette has something that she wants to tell you.

21:21.790 --> 21:23.100
Do you love me, Mommy?

21:26.630 --> 21:28.650
I'm sorry. I don't think I heard you correctly.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.389
I said something happened to your car.

21:31.390 --> 21:32.730
It's nothing major.

21:33.190 --> 21:36.330
It's just the back fender-- it's a little scrunched.

21:36.330 --> 21:37.660
But the kids are okay.

21:38.050 --> 21:40.300
Everybody's okay. Nobody got hurt.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.339
And please don't get mad at Ariel.

21:42.340 --> 21:45.200
It was actually Bridgette who was behind the wheel when it happened.

21:46.860 --> 21:48.810
How is that even possible?

21:49.020 --> 21:50.090
You know what...

21:51.160 --> 21:53.310
I don't want to talk about this. I'm exhausted from this whole thing.

21:53.370 --> 21:54.689
I finally got the girls to go to bed.

21:54.690 --> 21:56.729
It's the bumper, the fender,

21:56.730 --> 21:58.169
whatever that thing is in the back.

21:58.170 --> 21:59.390
We'll get it fixed.

22:00.650 --> 22:02.759
Where were you, uh, you know, when all this happened?

22:02.760 --> 22:04.310
What does that have to do with anything?

22:04.310 --> 22:05.740
What, now you're taking offense?

22:06.230 --> 22:07.800
Look, Allison, you just told me that

22:07.800 --> 22:09.480
my car rolled backwards down the driveway

22:09.480 --> 22:11.959
with our 11-year-old daughter behind the wheel.

22:11.960 --> 22:14.950
And I don't have the right to ask where you were in relation to all this?

22:14.950 --> 22:16.849
Well, I was a hell of a lot closer than you were.

22:16.850 --> 22:17.850
I was at work.

22:18.590 --> 22:19.610
Yeah, I knew that.

22:19.720 --> 22:20.749
Your point being?

22:20.750 --> 22:22.790
Hey, I don't know what the point is, Allison.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.720
But this is not what I wanted to hear.

22:25.190 --> 22:27.420
I don't know what to tell you. Turn on the radio.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.570
So other than that, how is everything?

22:49.980 --> 22:51.070
Come on.

22:51.920 --> 22:53.480
You can do this.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.580
Just go in there, say hi.

23:01.160 --> 23:03.540
Nothing's going to happen if you just sit here in your car.

23:24.590 --> 23:25.600
Uh-uh, Ruth.

23:26.610 --> 23:30.310
Life hands you lemons-- you go get a lemonade.

23:30.670 --> 23:32.500
Or maybe a whiskey sour.

24:00.980 --> 24:02.540
To future business ventures.

24:08.510 --> 24:09.950
So...

24:11.640 --> 24:15.210
I want to show you these. Huh?

24:17.780 --> 24:18.880
You're serious.

24:19.490 --> 24:20.500
Hockey masks?

24:20.750 --> 24:21.780
I'm telling you,

24:22.550 --> 24:24.490
it's like they were made for this kind of work.

24:24.900 --> 24:27.970
It's a bank robbery, not a horror film.

24:29.410 --> 24:31.400
Oh, lighten up, nobody can hear me.

24:34.270 --> 24:35.990
I even know which teller I'm going to hit.

24:36.680 --> 24:41.500
This little Miss Lonely Hearts-- always making goo-goo eyes at me every time I come there.

24:49.210 --> 24:50.070
Sir.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.670
I think Ruth Boddicker's been lying to us.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.379
Well, good morning to you, too.

24:56.380 --> 24:57.890
Sir, I'm serious.

24:58.100 --> 25:00.469
I don't think she knew about that bank robbery 'cause she dreamt it.

25:00.470 --> 25:01.890
I think she knew about that bank robbery

25:01.890 --> 25:03.980
'cause she was sweet on one of the robbers

25:03.980 --> 25:05.310
and she overheard it.

25:05.900 --> 25:08.629
Then how do you explain her ability to find that body yesterday?

25:08.630 --> 25:10.179
Are you telling me she didn't dream that either?

25:10.180 --> 25:12.350
I don't know the answer to that, sir. Not yet.

25:12.670 --> 25:15.650
I'll tell you what, why don't we ask her?

25:17.020 --> 25:20.220
I called her and asked her if she could stop by on her way to work.

25:20.820 --> 25:22.410
And here she is now.

25:26.800 --> 25:29.170
Ladies, I have a bit of a problem

25:29.230 --> 25:30.800
and I'd like to share it with you.

25:30.940 --> 25:33.230
Yesterday you both sat down with detectives

25:33.230 --> 25:38.309
and gave descriptions of the man you believed was responsible for the killing of Jimmy Fleming--

25:38.330 --> 25:41.770
one of the two men suspected in the robbery of the Maricopa National Bank.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.640
Now based on the separate descriptions you gave,

25:46.670 --> 25:49.020
here are the composite sketches they've come up with.

25:50.310 --> 25:51.450
Well, that can't be.

25:51.770 --> 25:53.900
Actually, it's perfect.

25:54.620 --> 25:56.169
That's exactly what he looks like.

25:56.170 --> 25:57.260
No, no, no. No, no.

25:57.260 --> 25:59.329
I have to say something. Ruth, you know

25:59.330 --> 26:01.489
this looks nothing like the man we're looking for.

26:01.490 --> 26:03.060
He looks like it to me.

26:03.150 --> 26:04.350
In my dream, he looks just like that.

26:04.350 --> 26:06.280
In your dream? Did you even have a dream?

26:07.300 --> 26:08.830
Are you mad at me?

26:09.540 --> 26:11.120
What are you talking about?

26:11.610 --> 26:15.229
Is this because I had a dream that led us to the body yesterday and you didn't?

26:15.280 --> 26:16.700
- Of course not.
- Ladies... 

26:16.700 --> 26:19.700
Because I would never do anything to knowingly upset you.

26:21.460 --> 26:22.940
But I can't lie.

26:26.870 --> 26:30.040
This is the man who killed the man we found in that park.

26:30.180 --> 26:31.210
He just is.

26:32.350 --> 26:34.910
And-and this man? You don't recognize him at all?

26:35.190 --> 26:36.389
You've never seen him before?

26:36.390 --> 26:37.390
Not in a bar

26:37.480 --> 26:39.399
talking with the man that we found dead yesterday?

26:39.400 --> 26:41.330
Talking about robbing a bank?

26:41.530 --> 26:43.890
Listening while his partner bragged

26:43.890 --> 26:46.230
about you making goo-goo eyes at him?

26:49.290 --> 26:50.700
Goo-goo eyes?

26:52.030 --> 26:54.270
You don't have to be cruel, Mrs. Dubois.

26:55.680 --> 26:59.340
I think I would remember if someone made a comment like that about me.

27:01.550 --> 27:04.020
In fact, I'm certain that I will always remember

27:04.340 --> 27:07.220
what you just said to me, here, now.

27:09.710 --> 27:11.260
I have to get to work.

27:12.290 --> 27:13.549
May I go now?

27:13.550 --> 27:14.620
Of course.

27:24.770 --> 27:25.860
Don't rush off.

27:27.020 --> 27:28.920
I've been waiting for you to get up and come out here.

27:28.990 --> 27:30.810
You're always asleep by the time I get home.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.020
You've been getting home so late.

27:33.630 --> 27:35.340
I figured that was the way you wanted it.

27:42.110 --> 27:43.240
Here's the thing.

27:46.250 --> 27:49.120
I'm actually really excited about all of it--

27:50.600 --> 27:53.370
you, the baby.

27:54.860 --> 27:55.860
I am.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.480
I know it doesn't show.

28:01.650 --> 28:02.980
I know it's hard to tell.

28:10.280 --> 28:15.560
I think I'm scared I might not be very good at it.

28:21.670 --> 28:26.440
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'm terrified.

28:48.940 --> 28:50.900
Girls tried to stay up.

28:51.690 --> 28:53.670
I'm sorry I'm so late.

28:55.090 --> 28:56.930
It's not your fault the plane was late.

28:57.010 --> 28:59.010
Oh, it's so good to be home.

29:03.590 --> 29:04.490
What is this?

29:05.610 --> 29:06.960
It's from Bridgette.

29:07.210 --> 29:08.700
She offered to skip going to college

29:08.700 --> 29:11.600
so she could get a job and pay for that dent in your Jeep.

29:13.480 --> 29:14.820
She's half yours.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.060
Hello.

29:32.800 --> 29:35.090
- Ruth Boddicker.
- Speaking.

29:35.420 --> 29:37.010
Just saw you on the news.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.630
So you knew we were coming, huh?

29:41.840 --> 29:43.490
May I ask who's calling please?

29:44.100 --> 29:46.180
We met earlier today at the bank.

29:46.450 --> 29:51.150
I was wearing a hockey mask and carrying a big gun.

29:53.770 --> 29:55.330
Where's the rest of my money, Ruth?

29:55.890 --> 29:57.919
They said we got away with $300,000,

29:57.920 --> 30:01.040
but you and I both know it was $30,000.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.010
I have no idea what you're talking about.

30:03.730 --> 30:05.110
Where's my money, Ruth?

30:16.360 --> 30:18.050
You safe in your house now?

30:20.000 --> 30:21.220
All alone?

30:22.150 --> 30:24.750
Just you and my money?

30:27.190 --> 30:28.440
Think again.

30:39.770 --> 30:41.370
I don't think Mom's even up yet.

30:41.890 --> 30:45.149
And that means that we can have whatever we want for breakfast.

30:45.150 --> 30:46.650
Even candy?

30:46.850 --> 30:48.330
Definitely candy.

30:54.470 --> 30:56.500
Just who I've been waiting for.

30:58.910 --> 30:59.990
Where's Mom?

31:00.460 --> 31:02.879
Mom had to go somewhere very early this morning.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.930
So it's just you and me, kid.

31:05.520 --> 31:07.090
I'm going back to bed.

31:10.500 --> 31:12.320
Why don't you come over here and have a seat.

31:13.190 --> 31:14.340
Am I in big trouble?

31:15.390 --> 31:16.370
Pretty big.

31:19.610 --> 31:21.860
Ruth, those men robbed the bank,

31:22.640 --> 31:24.660
but you kept most of the money, didn't you?

31:25.030 --> 31:27.100
That's why you gave us that phony description of the robber--

31:27.100 --> 31:28.820
the one who killed his partner.

31:28.850 --> 31:31.670
'Cause he's the only other person who knows what you did.

31:32.350 --> 31:35.040
Ruth, you knew the body was going to be in the park

31:35.040 --> 31:36.479
'cause you brought it there.

31:36.480 --> 31:37.660
No.

31:38.150 --> 31:39.570
I dreamt about that body.

31:40.080 --> 31:41.590
I dreamt about that robbery.

31:41.950 --> 31:43.890
And I don't know anything about any money.

31:44.250 --> 31:45.720
I'm sorry.

31:45.950 --> 31:47.440
I can't talk with you anymore.

31:47.650 --> 31:48.900
My shift's about to begin.

31:50.090 --> 31:52.370
I really do hope you'll solve this case.

32:00.680 --> 32:01.620
Can I help you?

32:01.810 --> 32:03.200
Yeah, I wanted to pay a visit.

32:03.430 --> 32:05.170
Your name? Last name first.

32:05.730 --> 32:08.340
Scanlon, Lee.

32:10.220 --> 32:11.580
And who do you wish to see?

32:11.580 --> 32:13.870
Scanlon, Lee.

32:13.910 --> 32:14.990
Senior.

32:23.840 --> 32:25.610
Hey, Pop, it's Lee.

32:40.120 --> 32:41.400
You feeling all right?

32:51.810 --> 32:53.810
So, that girl I told you about...

32:57.180 --> 32:58.400
we're having a baby.

33:03.700 --> 33:05.300
And I will never hit it.

33:10.820 --> 33:12.490
I know I got your stuff...

33:13.270 --> 33:15.080
your DNA inside me.

33:20.990 --> 33:22.850
But I will never hit it.

33:26.580 --> 33:27.350
There.

33:27.350 --> 33:30.189
As soon as she starts putting the money into the bag the robbers gave her,

33:30.470 --> 33:32.190
she turns her back to the camera.

33:32.800 --> 33:33.880
Okay?

33:34.550 --> 33:36.550
Well, she did that on purpose. She didn't want anyone to see

33:36.550 --> 33:38.530
her load the robbers' bag with the smaller bills

33:38.530 --> 33:40.420
while she put the bigger bills in hers.

33:40.720 --> 33:42.670
Well, that's an interesting theory, Allison,

33:42.670 --> 33:45.060
but I don't actually see it.

33:45.410 --> 33:46.550
Well, I see it.

33:47.280 --> 33:49.830
Allison, no judge is going to issue a warrant

33:49.830 --> 33:53.190
because someone being held at gunpoint just happens to turn their back

33:53.190 --> 33:55.290
to a security camera during a robbery.

33:55.530 --> 33:56.760
Sir, we have to get ahead of this guy.

33:56.760 --> 33:58.019
We have to confront Ruth,

33:58.020 --> 33:59.269
get her to give that money back

33:59.270 --> 34:01.020
or this man's gonna kill her for it.

34:01.350 --> 34:02.899
You may very well be right,

34:02.900 --> 34:05.059
but, uh, this office isn't set up

34:05.060 --> 34:07.140
to protect one criminal from another.

34:07.570 --> 34:09.609
And if she is an innocent victim in all this,

34:09.610 --> 34:12.300
if he really is pursuing and threatening her,

34:12.730 --> 34:14.938
then she needs to come in this office and file a complaint.

34:14.940 --> 34:16.530
But until she does that...

34:18.469 --> 34:19.429
Anything else?

34:20.790 --> 34:21.850
I guess not.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.139
You bring it?

34:41.880 --> 34:43.659
$135,000.

34:44.000 --> 34:44.920
Your half.

34:45.719 --> 34:47.000
Just like we agreed on.

34:47.480 --> 34:50.100
The same exact amount you would've had when you left the bank.

35:05.280 --> 35:06.370
Yeah...

35:12.200 --> 35:13.830
Now, tell me where the rest of it is.

35:14.130 --> 35:15.470
But we had a deal.

35:15.990 --> 35:17.720
"Had." Yeah.

35:19.860 --> 35:20.780
I have it.

35:21.390 --> 35:22.440
It's with me.

35:22.860 --> 35:24.900
You broke into my house, I couldn't leave it there.

35:25.720 --> 35:27.550
Um, it's in the trunk.

35:28.550 --> 35:29.680
Keys.

35:33.580 --> 35:34.730
All right.

35:50.780 --> 35:51.860
I don't see it.

35:57.220 --> 35:59.590
Now, you give me your car keys.

36:00.110 --> 36:01.480
You can bite me, old lady.

36:01.810 --> 36:03.190
You ain't gonna pull that trigger.

36:04.900 --> 36:06.020
I'll do it!

36:06.700 --> 36:07.770
Keys!

36:08.500 --> 36:09.770
All right.

36:31.970 --> 36:33.780
Is somebody actually at the door?

36:34.210 --> 36:35.630
What the hell time is it?

36:36.110 --> 36:37.450
It's a little after 2:00.

36:44.500 --> 36:46.440
I took a killer's car,

36:46.670 --> 36:48.390
I took a killer's gun,

36:49.510 --> 36:51.790
and I took the money from the bank.

36:52.200 --> 36:53.430
Help.

37:00.130 --> 37:00.940
????

37:01.120 --> 37:02.779
I'm District Attorney Manuel Devalos.

37:02.780 --> 37:04.860
I'm sorry to disturb you so early in the morning.

37:05.270 --> 37:08.260
You, uh, you look like you've had a rough night.

37:08.710 --> 37:10.750
Yeah, I actually just got in.

37:11.550 --> 37:13.320
Had myself a rather long walk.

37:13.320 --> 37:16.270
What, um, what can I do for you?

37:16.760 --> 37:20.300
Well, I'm here to inform you that you are officially a suspect in a robbery

37:20.300 --> 37:22.900
that took place several days ago at the Maricopa National Bank.

37:23.000 --> 37:23.900
Really?

37:23.900 --> 37:24.940
Truly.

37:25.570 --> 37:27.769
In fact, I'm in possession of a warrant authorizing me

37:27.770 --> 37:29.339
to search your vehicle for stolen money

37:29.340 --> 37:31.060
and a possible murder weapon.

37:31.450 --> 37:32.340
My vehicle?

37:33.550 --> 37:34.340
Well...

37:34.780 --> 37:35.949
looks like you're out of luck there,

37:35.950 --> 37:38.790
Mr. District Attorney.

37:39.630 --> 37:41.600
'Cause my vehicle was recently stolen.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.140
Are you certain about that, sir?

37:44.860 --> 37:48.389
Because I do believe that this car in the driveway is, uh,

37:48.390 --> 37:49.720
registered in your name.

37:50.820 --> 37:52.639
By the way, you left the keys in the ignition.

37:52.640 --> 37:54.260
Not a smart thing to do in this neighborhood.

37:54.360 --> 37:56.230
Here's the search warrant I was telling you about.

37:57.980 --> 37:58.940
Okay.

38:10.210 --> 38:11.390
There's nothing in there.

38:19.210 --> 38:20.919
No, no, no, this is a setup.

38:20.920 --> 38:22.010
I didn't put that there.

38:22.270 --> 38:23.210
This is her.

38:24.090 --> 38:25.590
She took... She...

38:26.240 --> 38:27.650
She took that money!

38:28.590 --> 38:30.000
She planted it in my car!

38:30.170 --> 38:32.220
She stole my car; she planted it in there!

38:32.810 --> 38:33.990
I'm sorry, who are we talking about?

38:33.990 --> 38:35.629
The crazy lady from the news.

38:35.630 --> 38:37.069
Th-The bank teller.

38:37.070 --> 38:38.590
The one that thinks she's a psychic.

38:38.640 --> 38:39.760
But she is psychic.

38:40.330 --> 38:41.530
It was her dreams that led us here.

38:41.530 --> 38:43.580
She was the one who told me about the car in the driveway.

38:43.690 --> 38:45.669
She was the one who told me about the money in the trunk.

38:45.670 --> 38:48.700
And she's even the one who told me this is where you lived.

38:49.120 --> 38:52.300
So, and there was one other thing...

38:53.820 --> 38:54.800
Oh, yeah.

38:57.220 --> 38:58.990
She told me to look in the glove compartment.

39:02.400 --> 39:03.360
For a gun.

39:05.100 --> 39:06.449
So, now the only question is:

39:06.450 --> 39:08.129
Will the ballistics report on this gun

39:08.130 --> 39:11.059
match the bullet holes in the body of your friend

39:11.060 --> 39:12.990
and accomplice, Jimmy Fleming?

39:29.000 --> 39:30.289
You look pleased about something.

39:30.290 --> 39:31.500
Is it me or the box?

39:32.710 --> 39:33.870
I don't know yet.

39:33.920 --> 39:35.340
Let's see what's inside.

39:41.990 --> 39:43.290
I called the doctor.

39:44.270 --> 39:45.590
Found out it's a girl.

39:47.670 --> 39:48.800
I like it.

39:48.890 --> 39:50.190
Girl named Lee.

39:52.590 --> 39:53.770
A whole new thing.

39:56.590 --> 39:57.760
Come here, you.

40:08.130 --> 40:09.600
Morning, Miss Boddicker.

40:10.350 --> 40:12.200
FIRST ONE HERE AS USUAL.

40:13.880 --> 40:15.840
25 years is a long time.

40:16.090 --> 40:17.310
You develop habits.

40:18.020 --> 40:19.970
You know, I was just sitting in my office,

40:19.970 --> 40:23.240
thinking about how you came to me with your dreams

40:23.610 --> 40:25.460
and how I didn't listen.

40:25.830 --> 40:27.000
Oh, that's okay.

40:27.810 --> 40:29.300
Everything worked out, didn't it?

40:29.980 --> 40:31.689
I mean, the bank got its money back

40:31.690 --> 40:34.500
and I'm still here.

40:35.920 --> 40:38.050
Still, I wish I had listened.

40:38.700 --> 40:40.490
And I was nicer.

40:42.910 --> 40:46.129
If you have any more dreams you care to talk about,

40:46.130 --> 40:48.510
I hope you won't hesitate.

40:49.630 --> 40:55.680
Actually, I haven't been dreaming much lately, Mr. Hitchens.

40:56.020 --> 40:57.950
Whatever it was that made me dream,

40:58.870 --> 41:00.660
I think it went away.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.900
Actually, I had a dream last night.

41:13.850 --> 41:15.570
Ask me what it was.

41:16.910 --> 41:18.519
All right, Mr. Hitchens.

41:18.520 --> 41:19.800
What did you dream?

41:20.320 --> 41:22.590
I'll tell you but you can't laugh.

41:22.660 --> 41:24.450
And you can't tell anyone else.

41:24.900 --> 41:26.070
Very well, Mr. Hitchens.

41:26.070 --> 41:27.360
You have my word.

41:28.700 --> 41:29.800
You have to swear.

41:31.070 --> 41:33.790
All right, I swear.

41:34.160 --> 41:36.990
I won't laugh and I won't tell anyone else.

41:39.920 --> 41:42.950
I was dancing the tango.

41:43.730 --> 41:44.800
With you.

41:55.750 --> 41:57.140
Very nice dream.

41:59.640 --> 42:01.140
Ask me when it happens.

42:04.010 --> 42:05.250
When does it happen?

42:06.230 --> 42:07.890
Tonight, I hope.

42:10.660 --> 42:13.610
I hope you'll come by my office to discuss it later.

42:14.390 --> 42:16.130
Yes, sir, Mr. Hitchens.

42:22.180 --> 42:25.360
