WEBVTT

00:01.166 --> 00:03.500
Where did you
come upon the Darksaber?

00:03.500 --> 00:05.500
<i>I defeated Moff Gideon.</i>

00:06.166 --> 00:07.458
Did you kill him?

00:07.458 --> 00:08.541
No.

00:08.541 --> 00:11.208
But he was sent off
to the New Republic for interrogation,

00:11.208 --> 00:13.500
and he will face justice for his crimes.

00:13.500 --> 00:16.291
Death would have been justice
for his atrocities.

00:24.333 --> 00:25.916
Bo-Katan Kryze,

00:25.916 --> 00:30.458
you have done the highest honor
of the Creed, saving a foundling.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.416
We've got a construction boom
going on in the city.

00:34.416 --> 00:39.250
I can set you up with a prime tract
right over by the hot springs.

00:39.250 --> 00:41.666
So... What do you say?

00:41.666 --> 00:44.000
You'd make a very fine lawman.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.291
Why not request one from the New Republic?

00:46.291 --> 00:50.875
The last thing we intend is to bow down
to yet another far-off bureaucracy.

00:50.875 --> 00:52.375
We drink here.

00:53.250 --> 00:54.666
That is a school now.

00:54.666 --> 00:59.875
I forgot, it was your cut of my boss's
treasure that built this saloon.

00:59.875 --> 01:02.125
Is there a problem here, Magistrate?

01:05.416 --> 01:06.583
Get out of here, Vane.

01:13.833 --> 01:16.166
I have no quarrel with you, Gorian Shard.

01:16.375 --> 01:19.083
Surrender your ship
and I will spare your life.

01:19.083 --> 01:20.291
Kid.

01:20.291 --> 01:21.708
Never trust a pirate.

02:05.375 --> 02:11.958
Make a note, let's move the trade district
closer to the shipping terminals.

02:11.958 --> 02:14.333
That's a wonderful idea, High Magistrate.

02:15.125 --> 02:17.625
Wait a minute, where's the rail spur?

02:17.625 --> 02:20.416
We're going to be moving a lot of cargo
in and out of here.

02:23.500 --> 02:24.500
Hold on a second.

02:40.041 --> 02:41.500
Pirates?

02:41.500 --> 02:42.583
High Magistrate,

02:42.583 --> 02:46.875
there's a pirate Corsair violating
the airspace of the population zone.

02:47.041 --> 02:48.291
Shall I begin negotiations?

02:48.291 --> 02:49.500
No, no, no, no.

02:49.500 --> 02:52.000
If we buy them off,
that will set a bad precedent.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.666
Ah. Yes. Oh.

02:54.791 --> 02:55.875
You're being hailed, sir.

02:55.875 --> 02:57.583
You get the citizens to safety.

02:57.583 --> 02:58.666
I'll handle this.

02:58.666 --> 03:01.166
Engineers, thank you. To be continued.

03:11.208 --> 03:12.250
Gorian Shard.

03:12.833 --> 03:15.125
I knew that Corsair looked familiar.

03:16.541 --> 03:18.916
<i>I don't believe my eyes.</i>

03:19.625 --> 03:24.541
<i>The voice sounds like Greef Karga,
Guild Master of the Nevarro Hunters,</i>

03:24.541 --> 03:26.708
<i>but all I see before me</i>

03:26.708 --> 03:31.000
<i>is a pampered nobleman dressed
for the pomp of his wedding feast.</i>

03:32.041 --> 03:33.791
Believe your ears then,

03:34.458 --> 03:38.041
and don't mistake my hospitality
for weakness.

03:38.208 --> 03:42.416
<i>Is that what you call gunning down
my helmsman in cold blood?</i>

03:42.416 --> 03:45.041
<i>When he let down his guard on your planet.</i>

03:45.208 --> 03:46.541
He shot first.

03:47.083 --> 03:51.708
<i>Well, now I will shoot first.</i>

03:52.791 --> 03:54.958
Are you sure that's a good idea?

03:54.958 --> 03:58.958
Nevarro is now under the protection
of the New Republic.

03:59.125 --> 04:03.625
<i>My charts indicate
that Nevarro is an independent world.</i>

04:04.125 --> 04:07.666
<i>You are no longer
under the protection of Moff Gideon.</i>

04:07.666 --> 04:11.375
The Spinward patrol
passes through here regularly.

04:13.958 --> 04:19.083
<i>The New Republic can't even protect
the Mid Rim from the Pirate Nation.</i>

04:20.000 --> 04:21.458
<i>This isn't sabacc.</i>

04:21.458 --> 04:24.708
<i>You can't bluff your way out
of this one, Karga.</i>

04:25.875 --> 04:28.125
- I thought you...
<i>- Don't hail me again</i>

04:28.125 --> 04:30.125
<i>unless it's to surrender.</i>

05:08.583 --> 05:11.125
High Magistrate, the escape pod is ready.

05:11.125 --> 05:14.500
- I will lead you to the launch site.
- I won't abandon my city.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.958
We have to get the people to safety.

05:16.958 --> 05:19.541
Send out a directive immediately.
Let's go!

05:19.541 --> 05:21.500
Evacuate. Alert! Alert!

05:21.500 --> 05:22.583
Please evacuate.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.666
Retreat to the lava flats.

05:24.666 --> 05:25.833
Alert!

06:34.750 --> 06:36.708
Can I use your viewer?
Mmm-hmm.

06:36.708 --> 06:37.833
Excuse me.

06:45.583 --> 06:47.125
Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

06:48.666 --> 06:52.791
<i>Captain Teva, we have been attacked
by Pirate King Gorian Shard.</i>

06:53.458 --> 06:56.458
<i>You once offered
that I might reach out to you.</i>

06:56.458 --> 07:01.000
<i>I am humbly requesting the New Republic
to send a patrol to clear out the raiders.</i>

07:01.875 --> 07:04.041
<i>I don't ask for your aid lightly.</i>

07:04.041 --> 07:05.750
<i>The situation is dire.</i>

07:05.750 --> 07:08.583
<i>I'm afraid that our planet will fall</i>

07:08.583 --> 07:11.291
<i>and Shard will turn this
into a pirate base.</i>

07:16.083 --> 07:17.291
Too bad.

07:17.291 --> 07:19.791
I really thought
Nevarro was gonna make it.

07:19.791 --> 07:21.833
I'm gonna forward this to Coruscant.

07:21.833 --> 07:23.541
Request permission to intercede.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.541
They haven't returned a dispatch in weeks.

07:26.541 --> 07:29.333
They're swamped.
You'll never get an answer in time.

07:31.291 --> 07:34.041
Then I'm just gonna have to go there
and talk to them myself.

07:34.041 --> 07:35.875
They can't ignore me face-to-face.

07:35.875 --> 07:37.875
I like your attitude.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.708
Good luck. You're gonna need it.

08:11.958 --> 08:13.958
Captain Teva here
to see Colonel Tuttle.

08:16.041 --> 08:17.500
It'll only be a minute.

08:18.625 --> 08:21.625
No, no, no. Do not put
any more stuff on that part of the desk.

08:21.625 --> 08:22.750
That's my work area.

08:32.750 --> 08:34.916
It's okay. He can stay.

08:34.916 --> 08:36.708
You, scoot.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.416
- And you are?
- Carson Teva. Adelphi Base.

08:45.083 --> 08:47.750
Adelphi? You're a long way from home.

08:47.750 --> 08:48.958
How may I be of service?

08:48.958 --> 08:51.833
I'm requesting authorization
and backup for Adelphi squadron

08:51.833 --> 08:54.083
in dealing with a pirate siege on Nevarro.

08:54.083 --> 08:56.833
Nevarro? Haven't heard of it.

08:56.833 --> 08:58.916
It's a small planet on the Outer Rim.

08:58.916 --> 09:02.000
The High Magistrate of the capital city
sent me this message.

09:10.250 --> 09:14.375
<i>Captain Teva, we have been attacked
by Pirate King Gorian Shard.</i>

09:15.000 --> 09:17.208
<i>You once offered
that I might reach out to you.</i>

09:17.916 --> 09:20.708
<i>I am humbly requesting the New Republic
to send a patr...</i>

09:22.375 --> 09:25.666
I get the gist.
It does sound concerning.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.833
Excuse me, Colonel.

09:27.833 --> 09:30.500
I'm going down to the commissary,
can I get you anything?

09:30.500 --> 09:32.458
Thank you, I'm fine for now.

09:32.458 --> 09:35.500
I'm sorry, officer, you spent some time
in the Outer Rim, right?

09:35.500 --> 09:37.041
Have you ever heard of Nevarro?

09:37.625 --> 09:38.791
I have.

09:38.791 --> 09:40.708
I spent some time there, in fact.

09:42.375 --> 09:45.833
They have yet to sign the Charter.
They're not a member planet.

09:45.833 --> 09:47.000
Uh-oh.

09:47.750 --> 09:48.750
That's not good.

09:48.750 --> 09:51.333
What does that matter?
We can't leave them defenseless.

09:51.333 --> 09:52.500
Of course not.

09:52.500 --> 09:56.583
But we have a backlog of requests
from member worlds that have priority.

09:56.583 --> 09:58.625
I don't even know
if we have the resources.

09:58.625 --> 10:00.541
Especially for pirates.

10:00.541 --> 10:02.666
I don't think
that this is an isolated episode.

10:02.666 --> 10:06.041
Nevarro has reported accounts
of Stormtroopers in the streets

10:06.041 --> 10:08.208
and TIE Fighters openly flying above.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.541
The citizens speak of Moff Gideon
occupying the town,

10:11.541 --> 10:14.500
and now a pirate king
is attempting the same thing?

10:14.500 --> 10:17.750
- These events could all be connected.
- I think that's a bit of a leap.

10:17.750 --> 10:21.083
Really? Because I'm hearing Moff Gideon
never made it to trial.

10:21.083 --> 10:24.416
Captain,
this isn't a rebellion anymore.

10:24.416 --> 10:25.916
We have a structure now.

10:25.916 --> 10:28.208
I work in Requisitions.

10:28.208 --> 10:30.250
So, let's focus on what you require.

10:30.250 --> 10:31.875
Okay, okay.

10:31.875 --> 10:36.791
I'm requesting authorization and backup
for dealing with pirates on Nevarro, sir.

10:39.083 --> 10:40.500
Perhaps the leaders of Nevarro

10:40.500 --> 10:43.500
need to understand why becoming
a Republic signatory is valuable.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.041
By letting them suffer?

10:46.500 --> 10:48.541
Sounds like a rather
Imperial way of thinking.

10:48.541 --> 10:50.958
Captain, you're out of line.
It's fine.

10:51.541 --> 10:53.166
I'm used to that kind of talk.

10:54.250 --> 10:56.166
But from experience,

10:56.166 --> 10:59.416
it often takes a new perspective
before one is able to see the light.

10:59.416 --> 11:01.666
You and your sort didn't "see the light."

11:02.375 --> 11:03.916
You were captured. No.

11:05.041 --> 11:06.500
I was liberated.

11:07.666 --> 11:10.833
In any event, thank you, Captain,
for bringing this to our attention.

11:10.833 --> 11:13.958
We'll see
if we can allocate some additional assets.

11:13.958 --> 11:16.000
Apologies, we can't do more.

11:20.291 --> 11:22.416
There's something dangerous
happening out there.

11:23.541 --> 11:26.250
All these events, it's not a coincidence.

11:27.458 --> 11:31.916
And by the time it becomes big enough
for you to act, it'll be too late.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.708
Citizens of Nevarro,

12:33.583 --> 12:35.333
we'll make camp here for a short while.

12:36.791 --> 12:38.500
Help will arrive soon.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.833
Very soon.

12:39.833 --> 12:41.791
How soon?
Who's coming to help?

12:41.791 --> 12:42.958
How are you so sure?

12:42.958 --> 12:45.583
I have sent a message to the New Republic.

12:46.458 --> 12:48.375
Help is on the way.

13:19.291 --> 13:20.291
There you are.

13:54.791 --> 13:57.916
Captain Carson Teva, Adelphi Rangers.

14:02.916 --> 14:05.666
I have a time pressing matter
to attend to.

14:05.666 --> 14:07.166
Clear out, Blue Boy.

14:08.958 --> 14:11.000
The New Republic isn't welcome here.

14:11.708 --> 14:13.333
Sorry for dropping in unannounced,

14:13.333 --> 14:16.583
but if I'd given warning,
your settlement would've cleared out

14:16.583 --> 14:18.208
before I ever hit atmosphere.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.833
How did you manage to find us?

14:22.291 --> 14:25.125
Mandalorians pride ourselves
on our secrecy.

14:26.125 --> 14:29.750
Fortunately, someone I served with
in the Rebellion is amongst your ranks.

14:37.708 --> 14:39.000
Thanks, R5.

14:40.208 --> 14:43.000
The entire covert
will now have to relocate.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.458
Or we could kill him.

14:45.666 --> 14:46.791
Stay right here.

14:48.625 --> 14:50.375
This man cut me a break once

14:50.375 --> 14:52.291
and now I'm returning the favor.

14:53.125 --> 14:54.333
Clear out, Blue.

14:54.666 --> 14:56.791
Greef Karga sent this holo-message.

15:07.958 --> 15:10.083
Nevarro is under siege by pirates.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.416
He's asking for help.

15:15.750 --> 15:17.250
Why are you really here?

15:18.083 --> 15:20.291
They're about to blow Nevarro to hell.

15:20.291 --> 15:21.875
Then call in a strike.

15:21.875 --> 15:23.583
We don't even have ships.

15:23.583 --> 15:25.125
Coruscant doesn't care.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.875
Karga is your friend.
You won't let him die.

15:30.291 --> 15:31.416
What's in it for you?

15:32.291 --> 15:35.541
The New Republic has to know
that the Empire is growing again.

15:36.458 --> 15:39.166
And you think the Pirate King
has something to do with it?

15:39.166 --> 15:42.916
I can't say for sure,
but something doesn't smell right.

15:42.916 --> 15:45.708
Look, it's not your fight.

15:45.708 --> 15:47.250
I just came to tell you,

15:47.250 --> 15:50.125
your friend is in danger
and I thought you should know.

16:00.666 --> 16:02.583
I know you'll relocate anyway,

16:02.583 --> 16:05.666
but you have my word,
I will not reveal your location.

16:06.541 --> 16:07.583
Sorry to intrude.

16:15.833 --> 16:17.291
BO-KATAN: So, what are you thinking?

16:19.083 --> 16:21.666
He's right. I gotta help the guy.

16:22.791 --> 16:24.041
BO-KATAN: You can't do it alone.

16:26.458 --> 16:28.916
Now, many of you don't know Greef Karga.

16:29.333 --> 16:32.250
And those that do fought against him
when you rescued me

16:32.250 --> 16:35.708
from his ambush many cycles ago
on the streets of Nevarro.

16:37.625 --> 16:39.875
Since then, he's had a change of heart

16:39.875 --> 16:44.875
and has risked his life to save mine
as well as the foundling in my charge.

16:47.750 --> 16:50.541
I stand before you
to petition an intervention.

16:51.791 --> 16:54.500
To help rescue Nevarro
before it's too late.

16:58.416 --> 17:01.041
I am in no position
to ask any more of you.

17:01.875 --> 17:02.916
However...

17:06.291 --> 17:07.541
However,

17:09.666 --> 17:13.791
the enemy that decimated this very covert
were Imperials,

17:13.791 --> 17:15.875
not Greef Karga's bounty hunters.

17:17.208 --> 17:19.500
Greef Karga is now a High Magistrate

17:19.500 --> 17:23.250
and has offered me a tract of land
on his independent world.

17:25.500 --> 17:28.875
Perhaps it is time for us
to live in the light once again

17:28.875 --> 17:30.833
on a planet where we are welcome.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.583
So our culture may flourish

17:33.583 --> 17:37.083
and our children can feel
what it is to play in the sunlight.

17:51.666 --> 17:54.000
Does anyone else wish to speak?

17:56.541 --> 17:58.041
It's up to them now.

18:00.125 --> 18:01.208
I do.

18:09.833 --> 18:11.875
I was there on Nevarro that night.

18:13.250 --> 18:16.166
I fought against
Greef Karga and his hunters.

18:17.083 --> 18:19.041
I saw my brothers and sisters

18:19.041 --> 18:22.875
fall at the hands of the Imperial butchers
that hunted us in the sewers.

18:24.041 --> 18:29.416
I saw many die to save the life
of this one, tiny foundling.

18:33.083 --> 18:35.875
And now we are asked
to sacrifice yet again.

18:41.166 --> 18:43.166
The question
we should be asking ourselves is,

18:43.166 --> 18:44.291
"Why?

18:46.125 --> 18:48.833
"Why should we lay our lives down
yet again?"

18:57.500 --> 18:59.291
Because we are Mandalorians.

19:01.541 --> 19:07.000
I have had my disagreements with this man,
but he risked his life to save my son.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.583
And Bo-Katan Kryze
did not give up on my child's life

19:11.583 --> 19:13.333
even when the rest of us did.

19:17.583 --> 19:21.875
These two are asking us to take up arms
in the name of a brighter future,

19:21.875 --> 19:25.541
and I for one will take up arms
to fight by their side.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.958
This is the Way.

19:30.833 --> 19:32.458
This is the Way.

19:33.958 --> 19:35.250
This is the Way.

19:39.333 --> 19:42.250
BO-KATAN:
This is a <i>Kom'rk</i> Class fighter transport.

19:42.250 --> 19:44.125
I'll use this to drop you in

19:44.125 --> 19:47.458
and you will operate
as a tight military unit.

19:47.458 --> 19:50.208
Din Djarin and myself
will reinforce from above.

19:50.875 --> 19:52.541
If everyone acts as they should,

19:52.541 --> 19:56.375
we can use the element of surprise
and defeat an enemy that outnumbers us.

20:00.333 --> 20:03.833
<i>Pirate King Gorian Shard
is captaining a Cumulus Class Corsair</i>

20:03.833 --> 20:05.583
<i>carrying a complement of snubfighters.</i>

20:06.583 --> 20:08.541
<i>It has aerial bombardment capabilities.</i>

20:09.500 --> 20:12.500
<i>The N-1 will distract the Corsair
and her snubfighters</i>

20:12.500 --> 20:14.708
<i>as we drop in to liberate
the planet below.</i>

20:15.291 --> 20:17.916
Nevarro is an independent planet

20:17.916 --> 20:21.583
and no longer under remnant Imperial
or New Republic protection.

20:22.333 --> 20:26.083
But it's that very independence
that makes it appealing for you to settle.

20:27.250 --> 20:30.416
You lived there once,
hiding in the sewers.

20:31.208 --> 20:34.125
But now, you can be heroes.

21:33.708 --> 21:37.000
Captain, there's a starfighter
off our port bow.

21:38.583 --> 21:39.708
Hmm?

21:41.375 --> 21:42.375
Ah!

21:42.625 --> 21:44.375
It's the Mandalorian.

21:44.375 --> 21:45.791
Man the gunwales.

21:55.333 --> 21:57.083
Launch the snubfighters.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.208
Follow him!

22:06.875 --> 22:10.375
Bold of you to return, Mandalorian.

22:12.333 --> 22:13.791
Blast that ship!

22:13.791 --> 22:15.041
Understood.

22:21.166 --> 22:23.250
<i>Thanks for your help, Mando.</i>

22:23.250 --> 22:26.291
I decided to take you up on your offer
for a tract of land.

22:26.291 --> 22:27.500
Be careful, my friend.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.333
They've got you outnumbered ten to one.

22:34.750 --> 22:35.916
I like those odds.

22:35.916 --> 22:37.958
I bet you do.

22:45.708 --> 22:48.125
The Corsair's on me. Coast is clear.

22:51.166 --> 22:52.500
BO-KATAN: Approaching drop point.

22:54.041 --> 22:55.500
First team, prepare to drop.

23:01.541 --> 23:02.625
BO-KATAN: First team away.

23:21.833 --> 23:24.166
Area clear. Team two, you with us?

23:29.500 --> 23:31.416
Team two, moving toward courtyard.

23:39.458 --> 23:41.583
Don't let him get away!

23:41.583 --> 23:43.000
I'm on the N-1.

23:46.208 --> 23:47.500
BO-KATAN: Din, what's your position?

23:47.500 --> 23:50.458
I'm over the flats
with snubfighters in pursuit.

23:50.458 --> 23:52.125
You're clear to start your run.

23:56.708 --> 23:58.958
There's another ship, Captain.

23:58.958 --> 24:01.250
A <i>Kom'rk</i> Class fighter transport.

24:04.666 --> 24:07.500
They took out an engine.

24:07.500 --> 24:10.750
Tell Vane and the fighters
to reform for a counter attack.

24:10.750 --> 24:13.000
They're pursuing the Mandalorian.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.750
Then bring them back!

24:20.416 --> 24:23.083
You won't get away this time.

24:24.666 --> 24:27.291
Vane, come in. The starfighter's a decoy.

24:27.291 --> 24:28.750
There's a secondary attack.

24:29.833 --> 24:31.583
<i>Regroup at the Corsair.</i>

24:48.083 --> 24:49.708
Possible ambush, take cover.

25:08.708 --> 25:09.916
Behind us.

25:17.750 --> 25:18.750
We're boxed in.

26:30.500 --> 26:31.958
Engaging the Gauntlet.

26:44.833 --> 26:46.000
He's above you.

26:47.875 --> 26:49.083
He's below you.

26:52.625 --> 26:53.791
<i>Dank farrik!</i>

26:54.958 --> 26:57.791
Another engine down,
and shields are failing.

27:27.666 --> 27:30.416
All clear. Advance!

27:31.250 --> 27:32.458
On me!

27:36.375 --> 27:37.958
Forward.
Man your positions.

27:37.958 --> 27:39.375
Go, go, go!

28:06.791 --> 28:09.250
There's only
one snubfighter left, Captain.

28:09.958 --> 28:13.750
It's been a pleasure serving you, Captain,
but it's time to part ways.

28:14.833 --> 28:17.291
Vane, you coward.

28:17.291 --> 28:19.375
Sir, we're down to our last engine.

28:19.375 --> 28:21.208
We have to retreat.

28:23.833 --> 28:25.541
In a puffer pig's eye.

28:25.541 --> 28:27.375
Open fire below!

28:37.000 --> 28:38.708
BO-KATAN: He's targeting the townspeople.

28:38.708 --> 28:40.541
We've gotta take him down.

28:40.541 --> 28:42.375
Focus fire on their last engine.

29:15.291 --> 29:17.625
It's gonna be okay!
It's gonna be okay!

29:29.166 --> 29:34.375
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

29:34.375 --> 29:35.583
To all of you,

29:35.583 --> 29:39.583
and especially
to our fine Mandalorian liberators,

29:39.583 --> 29:43.541
to whom this planet is forever indebted.

29:44.958 --> 29:49.791
Mandalorians, I know that we have been
on opposite sides in the past,

29:50.833 --> 29:52.208
but that is behind us.

29:52.208 --> 29:58.166
From this day forward,
I, Magistrate Greef Karga...

29:58.166 --> 30:00.625
High Magistrate, sir.

30:01.791 --> 30:05.000
High Magistrate Greef Karga,

30:06.000 --> 30:10.625
hereby cede all land
from the western lava flats

30:10.625 --> 30:15.875
to Bulloch Canyon
to the fine people of Mandalore.

30:15.875 --> 30:22.416
You may no longer have a home planet,
but you do now have a home.

30:22.416 --> 30:23.583
Welcome.

30:25.833 --> 30:27.583
Welcome!

30:27.583 --> 30:29.416
Welcome, and thank you.

30:41.291 --> 30:43.291
The Armorer wishes to speak with you.

31:26.208 --> 31:30.250
This was once the forge of our covert.

31:32.833 --> 31:35.666
I have been
to the Great Forge on Mandalore.

31:39.791 --> 31:41.625
BO-KATAN: I remember the forge well.

31:45.708 --> 31:47.500
It was large and ornate

31:49.333 --> 31:53.250
and the air rang with the music
of a hundred hammers.

31:56.333 --> 31:59.458
And here stood a simple one.

32:01.333 --> 32:05.083
Yet, they were both forges.

32:06.416 --> 32:08.166
They served the same purpose.

32:14.375 --> 32:15.541
Remove your helmet.

32:18.083 --> 32:19.291
But...

32:20.708 --> 32:22.250
Do you respect my station?

32:24.000 --> 32:25.375
I do.

32:25.375 --> 32:27.250
Remove your helmet.

32:46.541 --> 32:52.375
Our people have strayed from the Way
and it is not enough for a few to walk it.

32:54.375 --> 32:56.125
We must walk it together.

32:57.666 --> 32:58.708
This is the Way.

32:59.875 --> 33:02.958
We must walk the Way together.

33:04.166 --> 33:06.458
All Mandalorians.

33:11.208 --> 33:12.208
I understand.

33:15.291 --> 33:20.791
I was taught that the Mythosaur
existed only in legends,

33:21.458 --> 33:25.958
and yet you saw it.

33:29.125 --> 33:32.208
It is a sign that the next age is upon us.

33:35.041 --> 33:37.833
Mandalore must all come together.

33:40.166 --> 33:42.125
You have walked both worlds.

33:43.250 --> 33:45.458
You are the one who can unite us.

34:25.958 --> 34:31.083
Bo-Katan Kryze is going off
to bring other Mandalorians in exile to us

34:31.083 --> 34:33.708
so that we may join together once again.

34:34.875 --> 34:36.500
But she shows her face.

34:39.666 --> 34:42.166
Bo-Katan walks both worlds.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.833
And she can bring all tribes together.

34:59.875 --> 35:03.041
It is time to retake Mandalore.

35:57.291 --> 35:58.916
Captain Teva to Lieutenant Reed.

36:00.125 --> 36:01.833
(ON COMMS) <i>Reed to Teva.</i>

36:02.375 --> 36:04.041
I found a derelict Lambda shuttle.

36:04.708 --> 36:05.791
<i>The hull was breached.</i>

36:05.791 --> 36:08.208
<i>The vessel shows evidence
of being attacked.</i>

36:08.208 --> 36:09.666
<i>Any reports in the area?</i>

36:10.958 --> 36:14.541
<i>Um, there's a record
of a missing craft in the region.</i>

36:15.416 --> 36:17.041
<i>The details are classified.</i>

36:20.166 --> 36:21.708
R7, launch probe.

36:34.500 --> 36:36.458
I'm sending you a transponder signal.

36:36.458 --> 36:39.875
Why don't you bounce it through
the flight logs at central command?

36:46.500 --> 36:48.375
<i>It's a New Republic prison transport.</i>

36:53.666 --> 36:54.833
Check the departure times.

36:57.541 --> 36:58.708
<i>I'll be damned.</i>

36:58.708 --> 37:01.291
<i>Flight times
match the ship transporting Moff Gideon.</i>

37:01.916 --> 37:02.958
I knew it.

37:03.708 --> 37:05.041
He never made it to trial.

37:08.125 --> 37:10.125
<i>There don't appear to be any survivors.</i>

37:12.541 --> 37:14.500
<i>And Moff Gideon's body is missing.</i>

37:15.833 --> 37:17.000
This was an extraction.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.333
<i>Who were the perpetrators?</i>

37:21.083 --> 37:22.375
Scanning.

37:24.541 --> 37:27.000
I'm only seeing
the remains of the flight crew.

37:32.291 --> 37:34.833
There appears to be something embedded
in the cabin wall.

37:34.833 --> 37:36.125
Get in close on that.

37:46.583 --> 37:48.583
It's a fragment of beskar alloy.

37:48.583 --> 37:53.083
<i>Wait, are you saying that Moff Gideon
was taken by... Mandalorians?</i>
