-Always.

01:01.494 --> 01:03.196

01:03.263 --> 01:05.131
Yeah, see you, Mum,

01:09.936 --> 01:11.504

Mr Smith, I need you
quickly and quietly.

MR SMITH: <i>Quickly and quietly.</i>

01:25.251 --> 01:26.419

01:32.425 --> 01:35.995

So, what was her story
this time?

01:49.476 --> 01:53.546
She says she's going to
a meeting at the town hall
about a motorway extension.

01:53.613 --> 01:57.984
K9: <i>Mistress' exact words,</i>
<i>"You'll never know, Luke,</i>

<i>you are using</i>
<i>my tracking system to</i>
<i>spy on Sarah Jane?</i>

02:14.701 --> 02:16.402
It's the fifth time
she's done this
in a month, Mr Smith.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.271
We've gotta find out
what she's really doing.

02:18.338 --> 02:21.608
She goes off on her own,
all mysterious,
what if she gets in trouble?

02:21.674 --> 02:23.810

02:33.887 --> 02:37.457

We follow her down there?

03:18.631 --> 03:20.633

be doing that in public.
Actually at all!

04:19.459 --> 04:22.762
Shut up, Clyde.
Oh, that's brilliant,
she's got herself a man.

04:22.829 --> 04:26.132
-What are we gonna say?
-We're not gonna say anything!

04:26.199 --> 04:29.836
She wants it kept a secret,
so we never saw that
and we don't know, yeah?

04:31.237 --> 04:32.772
Luke?

04:32.839 --> 04:35.108
Yeah.

04:35.174 --> 04:36.876

she was hunting aliens.

Luke's helping us revise.

04:57.830 --> 04:59.465

04:59.532 --> 05:01.134
Yeah, how was the,

05:02.669 --> 05:03.803
Nothing special.

05:03.870 --> 05:05.471
Why is Mr Smith still out?

05:06.439 --> 05:07.940
MR SMITH: <i>Information.</i>

<i>I have been tracking</i>
<i>your position,</i>
<i>as instructed by Luke.</i>

Big mouth!
You did that on purpose!

05:18.851 --> 05:20.920
K9, what have they been doing?

05:20.987 --> 05:24.323
K9: <i>I have been instructed</i>
<i>to withhold information.</i>

05:24.390 --> 05:26.592
What was your
exact instruction?

05:26.659 --> 05:29.429
Mistress Rani instructed me
not to relay the information

05:29.495 --> 05:31.664
that you were followed
to your assignation.

05:31.731 --> 05:32.999
The gob on you!

05:33.066 --> 05:35.268
-You've been spying on me?
-We were worried.

05:35.334 --> 05:39.272
When you've kept something
secret before, it's always
been a disaster.

05:39.338 --> 05:41.507
Does that give you the right
to poke into
my private business?

05:43.676 --> 05:46.879
Oh, I was about to
tell you anyway.

05:48.715 --> 05:49.949
So who's the lucky fella,
then?

05:51.751 --> 05:53.152
His name is Peter Dalton

05:53.219 --> 05:55.955
and, yes, he's very lucky
and rather marvellous.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.191
Ooh! Where did you meet him?

05:58.257 --> 06:00.393
Oh, no, that's all,

(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

06:38.264 --> 06:41.834
Honestly, I was about to
tell you... I think.

06:43.436 --> 06:46.539
I'm not exactly an expert
in matters of the heart.

06:47.273 --> 06:49.075
Neither am I.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.677
I thought something
was bound to go wrong,
with my track record.

06:51.744 --> 06:54.347
And it keeps getting better.

06:55.615 --> 06:58.117
I didn't know you had
those sort of feelings.

06:58.184 --> 07:00.553
Men were interested before,

07:00.620 --> 07:02.321
but then I'd think,

07:02.388 --> 07:04.857
"How can a relationship
go anywhere
with my bizarre life?"

07:10.429 --> 07:13.232
-Where did you meet him?
-In a shoe shop.

07:13.299 --> 07:15.568
We just got talking
and he gave me
his phone number.

07:15.635 --> 07:18.805
-I didn't know people of your
age did that kind of thing.
-Cheek!

07:18.871 --> 07:21.307
Oh no,
I wasn't going to call him,
but then

07:21.374 --> 07:24.510
I bumped into him again
and it got me thinking.

07:24.577 --> 07:27.513
I cut myself off from people
for all those years.

07:27.580 --> 07:31.450
How could anyone like me,
with what I know, what I do,
ever have proper friends?

07:33.052 --> 07:37.190
But then I got you,
and Maria and Clyde
and Rani,

07:37.256 --> 07:40.159
and things changed,
and perhaps they're
changing on this front.

07:41.227 --> 07:42.929
You look really happy.

07:42.995 --> 07:45.765
But there's still the big
problem, isn't there?

07:45.832 --> 07:49.101
I can't suddenly
spring it all on Peter.

07:49.168 --> 07:52.271

all the madness quiet
for a bit longer? Hmm?

08:13.426 --> 08:14.861
See how things go.

Oh! And he would choose today
to wake up!

14:31.437 --> 14:34.607

a link up to Polongus and
they'll transmit him home.

There's a for sale sign.

it looks empty.

she'd never been to his place.

He's a partner in a law firm,

You don't want things
to change.

Neither do I.

isn't that important?

16:34.059 --> 16:35.527
Yeah.

Well, you don't have
to look so pleased.

18:25.671 --> 18:29.007
I know it's a bit of a shock,
but Peter's got it
all planned.

18:29.074 --> 18:32.144
-I bet he has.
-What do you mean?

18:32.211 --> 18:35.113
Sarah Jane, we went round
to Peter's house.

18:35.180 --> 18:38.183
-You did what?
-There's nothing there.
It's empty.

18:38.250 --> 18:40.452
What? What do you mean?

18:41.987 --> 18:42.888
Mum?

18:46.024 --> 18:50.529
I know it's empty.
He doesn't really live there.

18:50.596 --> 18:54.433
His firm got him
a flat in London,
nearer the office.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.435
And you've been there?

18:56.502 --> 18:58.770
Plenty of times.

18:58.837 --> 19:03.008
Oh, I should be
angry with you,
breaking in there.

19:03.075 --> 19:07.079
Oh well, it's what I do,
isn't it?

19:07.145 --> 19:10.315
Oh, look at you,
I've made you all
so suspicious.

19:10.382 --> 19:13.752
But this is a happy thing,
and I want you all
to be part of it.

19:13.819 --> 19:16.421
It isn't the end of the world.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.224

to sneak around

19:19.291 --> 19:21.159

Peter had it all on standby,
a nice hotel in the country.

You're all invited.
And you, Luke,
you can give me away.

it's a bit fast?

tell us something!

after itself.

something normal
for a change,

and I don't want anything,
any of this
getting in the way.

You haven't told Peter
about our thing,
what we do?

20:23.288 --> 20:26.858
Why should I?
Perhaps I never will.
Perhaps that's the solution.

20:28.493 --> 20:30.362
I don't like this.

I know what'll stop
you worrying, Clyde.

you can look after K9.

And there's that wedding fair.

can do the flowers,
before she asks.

everybody out.

her dad's tied up at work.

come, Clyde.

I wouldn't miss this.
What if something happens?

22:00.352 --> 22:02.921
Just because your dad
turned out bad
doesn't mean mine will.

He's not your dad.

to be her editor.

Oh, that's her accountant,
I can't remember his name.

-You must be slipping.
-Bit of a sorry turnout.

22:28.447 --> 22:31.683
Well, I suppose
that's what happens when
you rush to get married.

It is rather peculiar.

repent at leisure,

after the reception,
somewhere exotic?

22:59.778 --> 23:01.747
Afterwards is a surprise.

23:03.782 --> 23:06.651
It can't be any worse
than our honeymoon.

have gone for the Doctor
to give you away.

I need somebody reliable,
and I'm so very, very glad
it's you.

I send the invite?

was under there,

wrong about this.

Good afternoon, everyone.
I'm the superintendent
registrar.

In each other's company
they have found happiness,
fulfilment and love,

25:46.611 --> 25:49.547
and they wish to affirm
their relationship
with this marriage.

25:51.016 --> 25:53.285
Now, I have to ask
this question.

25:53.351 --> 25:56.087
If any person can show
just cause or impediment

25:56.288 --> 25:58.223
why they may not be
joined together,

let them speak now or forever
hold their peace.

is that?

26:41.232 --> 26:42.467
Trickster, let her go!

26:42.534 --> 26:44.769
Too late, Time Lord!

26:46.972 --> 26:49.874
You are mine,
Sarah Jane Smith.

26:51.376 --> 26:52.877
Mine forever.

26:53.578 --> 26:55.180
Sarah!

26:55.246 --> 26:56.848
Doctor!

27:02.087 --> 27:04.923
-Time's stopped.
-Time trap.

27:04.990 --> 27:07.926
The Trickster
doesn't want us helping Sarah,
so he's separated us,

27:08.126 --> 27:10.595
trapped us
in two different seconds.

27:10.662 --> 27:12.430
All you have to say is "I do".

27:12.497 --> 27:15.867
And if you don't,
you'll remain here forever.

27:17.702 --> 27:20.171
-Trickster!
-Without Sarah,
without you lot

27:20.238 --> 27:21.940
saving the world
from your attic in Ealing,

27:22.007 --> 27:24.075
there'll be chaos
and destruction.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.677
Meat and drink
to the Trickster.

27:25.744 --> 27:27.746
-(SHOUTING)
-Clyde, no!

27:28.813 --> 27:29.848
Come on now!
