Get off it!

MALCOLM:

00:33.575 --> 00:35.536
Leave the squirrel alone

00:35.577 --> 00:37.538
and get the fire extinguisher.

00:37.579 --> 00:38.956
Reese, no!

00:38.998 --> 00:42.376
(crashing)

DEWEY:

00:42.417 --> 00:43.878
Blood tastes funny.

00:43.919 --> 00:46.087
You better be naked

00:43.919 --> 00:46.087

Malcolm.

(screaming)

01:30.674 --> 01:32.927
How was that

01:30.674 --> 01:32.927
even remotely fair?!

01:32.968 --> 01:34.135
That's for us all having to go

01:34.177 --> 01:36.137
to your stupid

01:34.177 --> 01:36.137
Krelboyne picnic today.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.139
You think  I

01:36.179 --> 01:38.139
want you to go?

01:40.225 --> 01:42.519
My special class

01:40.225 --> 01:42.519
is having a family day,

01:42.561 --> 01:44.145
and if that's not bad enough,

01:44.187 --> 01:46.607
it's on the weekend

01:44.187 --> 01:46.607
that Francis is home.

01:46.648 --> 01:50.027
I'm going to look like

01:46.648 --> 01:50.027
a total idiot in front of him.

01:50.069 --> 01:52.279
Pretty bunnies.

01:53.196 --> 01:55.156
Pretty bunnies.

01:55.198 --> 01:58.660
Luckily, I've got a brilliant

01:55.198 --> 01:58.660
plan to get out of this.

01:58.702 --> 02:01.080
(retching, coughing)

02:01.121 --> 02:04.416
Oh, poor baby.

02:04.458 --> 02:07.168
Yeah, I'm sick.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.170
No, you're grounded for pouring

02:09.212 --> 02:11.256
perfectly good vegetable soup

02:09.212 --> 02:11.256
in the toilet.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.634
And you owe me 49 cents.

02:13.675 --> 02:15.677
(flushing)

02:17.304 --> 02:19.264
I don't understand

02:17.304 --> 02:19.264
why you don't want to go

02:19.306 --> 02:21.600
to this picnic, Malcolm;

02:19.306 --> 02:21.600
I think it sounds like fun.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.184
Yeah, sitting on the grass,

02:21.642 --> 02:23.184
eating barbecue.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.561
It's Krelboynes.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.063
It's not going to be

02:24.603 --> 02:26.063
on  the grass

02:26.105 --> 02:27.689
because half the class

02:26.105 --> 02:27.689
is allergic.

02:27.731 --> 02:29.566
And don't expect

02:27.731 --> 02:29.566
any meat, either,

02:29.608 --> 02:32.193
because they all voted

02:29.608 --> 02:32.193
not to serve anything

02:32.235 --> 02:33.361
that ever had a mother.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.489
Cousin Nancy

02:33.403 --> 02:35.489
doesn't have a mother.

02:35.530 --> 02:38.075
That's right.

02:35.530 --> 02:38.075
She has two daddies.

02:38.117 --> 02:40.201
Oh, man, two guys

02:38.117 --> 02:40.201
as your parents?

02:40.243 --> 02:42.830
That house has got to

02:40.243 --> 02:42.830
be a dude's paradise.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.456
HAL:

02:42.871 --> 02:44.456
You know,

02:44.498 --> 02:46.249
there are a lot

02:44.498 --> 02:46.249
of proven health benefits

02:46.291 --> 02:48.127
to the vegetarian lifestyle.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.837
In fact, I've

02:48.167 --> 02:49.837
been seriously

02:49.878 --> 02:51.212
considering it myself.

02:51.254 --> 02:52.923
LOIS: It'll be nice

02:51.254 --> 02:52.923
to meet the other parents.

02:52.965 --> 02:54.382
I'm sure they're much better

02:54.424 --> 02:56.010
than those carnival freaks

02:54.424 --> 02:56.010
in Reese's class.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.511
What a horrible

02:56.051 --> 02:57.511
bunch of people.

02:57.552 --> 02:59.096
Amen to that.

02:59.138 --> 03:01.431
Well, this just sounds

02:59.138 --> 03:01.431
like a blast to me.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.224
Why do I have

03:01.473 --> 03:03.224
to go, again?

03:03.266 --> 03:04.852
Because it's a family

03:03.266 --> 03:04.852
picnic, Francis,

03:04.893 --> 03:06.227
and you're a member

03:04.893 --> 03:06.227
of this family.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.271
Oh, right, see, I just

03:06.269 --> 03:08.271
keep forgetting that,

03:08.313 --> 03:09.439
being forced to live

03:08.313 --> 03:09.439
a thousand miles away

03:09.481 --> 03:11.232
at military school

03:09.481 --> 03:11.232
and all.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.652
Well, I can't wait to see

03:11.274 --> 03:13.652
this academic circus.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.279
I bet it's really cute.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.279
It's not a circus.

03:16.321 --> 03:19.407
It's a bunch of social misfits

03:16.321 --> 03:19.407
doing a bunch of weird stunts

03:19.449 --> 03:21.076
to show off how smart they are.

03:21.118 --> 03:22.452
What's your weird stunt, honey?

03:22.494 --> 03:25.246
Just some lame thing--

03:22.494 --> 03:25.246
nothing you want to see.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.248
You've got to get

03:25.288 --> 03:27.248
me out of there

03:27.290 --> 03:28.667
before my turn comes.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.169
Why? What's the big deal?

03:30.209 --> 03:31.461
It just is, okay?

03:31.503 --> 03:33.254
I don't want

03:31.503 --> 03:33.254
to do my act.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.840
All right, relax.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.257
We'll hang out

03:34.882 --> 03:36.257
for, like, 15 minutes,

03:36.299 --> 03:38.135
establish your presence.

03:38.177 --> 03:41.262
Then we'll go over the fence,

03:38.177 --> 03:41.262
like at Grandma's wedding.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.639
(sighs)

03:42.681 --> 03:44.349
That's why I love this guy.

03:44.391 --> 03:47.102
Welcome!

03:47.144 --> 03:48.269
Welcome one and all!

03:48.311 --> 03:51.356
Run away with us

03:48.311 --> 03:51.356
and join the circus!

03:51.398 --> 03:54.068
The  academic  circus!

03:54.109 --> 03:55.194
Oh, no.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.277
My teacher.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.946
Malcolm, thank goodness.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.322
I was so nervous.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.324
I had a dream

03:59.364 --> 04:01.324
you didn't come, and I was

04:01.366 --> 04:03.326
being chased by something big

04:01.366 --> 04:03.326
but invisible and...

04:03.368 --> 04:04.953
Never mind.

04:04.995 --> 04:07.247
You're here, and that's

04:04.995 --> 04:07.247
all that matters.

04:08.331 --> 04:11.001
Hello, little guy.

04:12.335 --> 04:15.255
Ready to leave your family

04:12.335 --> 04:15.255
and join the circus?

04:15.839 --> 04:17.298
Oh.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.298
Huh?

04:17.340 --> 04:18.842
Little lower, son.

04:20.052 --> 04:22.387
Oh, look at all

04:20.052 --> 04:22.387
your little friends.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.555
Hi.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.890
Hi, there.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.307
They're not

04:24.932 --> 04:26.307
my friends.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.602
They're a bunch

04:26.349 --> 04:28.602
of geeks and losers.

04:28.643 --> 04:29.770
Malcolm's in the house!

04:29.811 --> 04:31.312
(chanting):

04:29.811 --> 04:31.312
Malcolm! Malcolm!

04:31.354 --> 04:34.482
Malcolm! Malcolm! Malcolm!

04:34.524 --> 04:37.027
(chanting continues)

04:39.863 --> 04:42.908
I'm going to kick

04:39.863 --> 04:42.908
so much Krelboyne ass today,

04:42.950 --> 04:44.325
it's not even funny.

04:44.367 --> 04:47.621
Go, Malcolm! Go, Malcolm!

04:44.367 --> 04:47.621
Go, Malcolm!

04:47.662 --> 04:48.830
Easy.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.498
You got all afternoon.

04:50.540 --> 04:54.002
We're getting out of here

04:50.540 --> 04:54.002
in 15 minutes, right?

04:54.044 --> 04:55.336
Make it ten.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.337
Yeah.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.298
Ooh,  hello.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.551
And who might you be?

05:01.593 --> 05:02.594
What?

05:02.636 --> 05:04.221
Nothing.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.230
Hello. I'm Lois.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.230
This is Hal.

05:13.272 --> 05:14.606
We're Malcolm's parents.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.399
That's very nice.

05:16.441 --> 05:19.153
I'm Dorene.

05:16.441 --> 05:19.153
These are the girls.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.361
Hello, it's nice

05:19.194 --> 05:20.361
to meet you all.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.571
Yeah, it's really...

05:25.408 --> 05:26.910
...whatever.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.663
Hope everybody

05:27.995 --> 05:29.663
likes brownies.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.832
Oh, my, that is

05:29.704 --> 05:31.832
so thoughtful.

05:31.873 --> 05:34.084
Are those nuts?

05:31.873 --> 05:34.084
Walnuts.

05:34.126 --> 05:36.377
Oh, gee, we

05:34.126 --> 05:36.377
can't have that.

05:36.419 --> 05:39.589
Some of the children are

05:36.419 --> 05:39.589
severely allergic to nuts.

05:39.631 --> 05:42.301
Oh, my gosh, I had no idea.

05:39.631 --> 05:42.301
Whose child is allergic?

05:42.341 --> 05:44.552
Well, no one in this class

05:42.341 --> 05:44.552
specifically,

05:44.594 --> 05:46.805
but you can never

05:44.594 --> 05:46.805
be too careful.

05:55.814 --> 05:58.817
Believe me, this isn't meant

05:55.814 --> 05:58.817
to publicly humiliate you.

05:58.859 --> 06:02.654
I'm sure they

05:58.859 --> 06:02.654
were delicious.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.823
Oh, hi-ya, fellas.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.200
Hey, there.

06:06.241 --> 06:07.450
What's your pleasure--

06:06.241 --> 06:07.450
nature dog,

06:07.492 --> 06:09.786
health patty,

06:07.492 --> 06:09.786
tofu square?

06:09.828 --> 06:11.788
Good God.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.166
Want me to brown that chicken

06:11.830 --> 06:14.166
leg a little more for you?

06:16.710 --> 06:19.213
Well...

06:19.254 --> 06:21.548
looks like I got here

06:19.254 --> 06:21.548
just in time.

06:22.924 --> 06:25.302
Gentlemen...

06:25.344 --> 06:27.470
behold.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.350
Is that... meat?

06:31.390 --> 06:33.310
Nothing but.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.025
Hi.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.985
Hey.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.949
So, uh... you here?

06:47.991 --> 06:50.451
Yeah.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.452
You?

06:51.494 --> 06:53.412
Yeah.

06:59.294 --> 07:00.461
Hey, Stevie.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.714
Can't stop... to chat.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.133
Got to get... my chemicals...

07:05.175 --> 07:06.676
in the shade.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.263
I thought you were doing

07:06.718 --> 07:09.263
your report on oscilloscopes.

07:09.304 --> 07:11.472
Changed to... catalytics.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.392
It's more... exciting.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.269
Right?

07:15.310 --> 07:16.728
What do you care?

07:16.770 --> 07:18.980
I'm up... after you.

07:19.022 --> 07:19.773
So?

07:19.814 --> 07:21.775
Following you...

07:21.816 --> 07:23.526
is like...

07:23.568 --> 07:25.070
following Streisand.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.405
Well, don't worry about it.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.115
You won't be following me.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.158
Why?

07:30.200 --> 07:32.994
Have I been... bumped?

07:34.579 --> 07:36.373
Francis, what are you doing?!

07:36.415 --> 07:38.166
Come on, the coast

07:36.415 --> 07:38.166
is clear and...

07:38.208 --> 07:40.585
It's already been

07:38.208 --> 07:40.585
ten minutes and...

07:42.796 --> 07:45.382
We're not ditching out, are we?

07:54.849 --> 07:57.018
(quiet chatter)

08:02.565 --> 08:05.526
A small pack of Krelboynes

08:02.565 --> 08:05.526
has ventured out of hiding

08:05.568 --> 08:06.820
to bask in the afternoon sun.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.529
Their defenses down,

08:08.571 --> 08:11.199
they're an easy target

08:08.571 --> 08:11.199
for nearby predators.

08:11.241 --> 08:14.995
(sniffing)

08:18.373 --> 08:20.541
They sense danger,

08:18.373 --> 08:20.541
but it is too late.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.543
Their hesitation is fatal.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.004
(roaring)

08:25.005 --> 08:27.257
(frightened yelps)

08:38.601 --> 08:40.561
(panting)

08:40.603 --> 08:43.523
And the circle of life goes on.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.825
Kafkaesque, isn't it?

08:53.867 --> 08:55.076
Huh?

08:55.118 --> 08:56.161
Never mind.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.455
Kick his butt,

08:56.203 --> 08:58.455
Alphonse.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.670
Wait... wait.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.506
Here it comes.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.965
Yes, there!

09:09.007 --> 09:11.551
I've arrested

09:09.007 --> 09:11.551
the cellular mitosis!

09:16.639 --> 09:17.640
Thank you, Dabney.

09:17.682 --> 09:18.892
That was riveting.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.643
Our next act needs

09:18.933 --> 09:20.643
no introduction,

09:20.685 --> 09:23.604
having been the buzz of

09:20.685 --> 09:23.604
last year's math fair.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.274
Please welcome

09:23.646 --> 09:26.274
Flora Mayesh

09:26.316 --> 09:29.569
and Fermat's

09:26.316 --> 09:29.569
Last Theorem!

09:31.488 --> 09:32.613
Hello? Is this...?

09:32.655 --> 09:34.115
Testing.

09:34.157 --> 09:37.869
So, I understand that Malcolm

09:34.157 --> 09:37.869
has quite the vocabulary.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.705
Yeah, he's just yap, yap,

09:37.911 --> 09:40.705
yap, yap, yap, all day long.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.250
Well, that's not

09:40.747 --> 09:43.250
the vocabulary I meant.

09:43.291 --> 09:44.625
It seems that he's taught

09:44.667 --> 09:46.336
several of the children

09:44.667 --> 09:46.336
the "R" word.

09:46.378 --> 09:48.088
The "R" word?

09:48.129 --> 09:50.465
I'm sure it's just something

09:48.129 --> 09:50.465
he picked up off the street--

09:50.507 --> 09:53.009
certainly not at home.

09:53.051 --> 09:56.304
Yeah, well, "R"  you,  lady.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.560
So, this is

09:59.766 --> 10:01.560
going well, right?

10:01.601 --> 10:04.271
It's pretty much

10:01.601 --> 10:04.271
everything I expected.

10:04.312 --> 10:05.564
So, you ready, Malcolm?

10:05.646 --> 10:07.107
I mean, you're all set, right?

10:07.148 --> 10:08.358
Sure.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.901
Good.

10:11.694 --> 10:14.531
I'm... ready.

10:14.573 --> 10:17.075
Thanks for... asking.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.744
You know what's so great

10:17.117 --> 10:19.744
about our relationship?

10:19.786 --> 10:22.663
It just still feels so fresh,

10:19.786 --> 10:22.663
you know what I mean?

10:22.705 --> 10:23.664
Totally.

10:23.706 --> 10:24.958
HAL: All right,

10:23.706 --> 10:24.958
take it away.

10:24.999 --> 10:27.168
I need two burgers

10:24.999 --> 10:27.168
and a dog, Hal.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.920
Coming up.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.920
Dewey?

10:31.214 --> 10:32.048
Thank you, sir.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.716
All right.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.716
Thank you.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.676
What have I told you

10:33.758 --> 10:35.676
about raw meat, son?

10:35.718 --> 10:38.179
I'm not.

10:38.221 --> 10:40.307
Dad, I want you

10:38.221 --> 10:40.307
to meet someone.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.183
This is Jody.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.183
Hi.

10:42.225 --> 10:44.519
Oh, it's so great

10:42.225 --> 10:44.519
to finally meet you.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.687
Francis talks about you

10:44.561 --> 10:46.687
all the time.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.689
Oh, yeah?

10:48.731 --> 10:50.024
You, too.

10:52.235 --> 10:53.278
(sighs)

10:53.320 --> 10:54.695
I'm so glad

10:53.320 --> 10:54.695
that went well.

10:54.737 --> 10:57.865
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:57.907 --> 11:02.621
I give to you

10:57.907 --> 11:02.621
the Nixon electromagnet.

11:03.622 --> 11:04.581
(whirring hum)

11:04.623 --> 11:06.707
(loud clang)

11:06.749 --> 11:09.752
(muffled yelling, sobbing)

11:09.794 --> 11:12.547
This is going dreadfully.

11:12.589 --> 11:13.714
Am I wrong?

11:13.756 --> 11:16.217
Please tell me I'm wrong.

11:16.259 --> 11:17.636
Excuse me.

11:17.676 --> 11:18.719
For what?

11:18.761 --> 11:21.264
(sniffing)

11:28.021 --> 11:29.439
This is it.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.816
You're almost... up.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.734
Stop reminding me.

11:33.776 --> 11:34.819
Nervous?

11:34.861 --> 11:37.405
No, I just don't want

11:34.861 --> 11:37.405
to do this.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.740
Don't you ever get sick

11:37.447 --> 11:39.740
of being a Krelboyne?

11:39.782 --> 11:42.369
Of people thinking

11:39.782 --> 11:42.369
you're some kind of freak?

11:42.410 --> 11:44.745
You are...

11:44.787 --> 11:46.540
what you are.

11:46.581 --> 11:47.748
Accept it.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.000
Not without a fight.

11:49.042 --> 11:52.253
You're harshing... my buzz.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.549
Don't let... anyone...

11:55.590 --> 11:58.677
mess with... my stuff.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.473
You know, in the wrong hands,

12:03.515 --> 12:06.518
these chemicals can make

12:03.515 --> 12:06.518
a pretty powerful stink bomb.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.813
These hands look wrong enough.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.232
(sniffs)

12:12.273 --> 12:15.360
And this field trip to

12:12.273 --> 12:15.360
the historic ghost town,

12:15.402 --> 12:17.778
I think we all know

12:15.402 --> 12:17.778
what that leads to--

12:17.820 --> 12:19.780
the occult, devil worship,

12:19.822 --> 12:21.366
state colleges.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.992
So, then, it's agreed

12:23.034 --> 12:24.661
that the trip

12:23.034 --> 12:24.661
will be canceled.

12:24.703 --> 12:27.247
Wait a minute--

12:24.703 --> 12:27.247
you can't decide that.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.789
You didn't even vote.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.833
I was only going

12:28.831 --> 12:30.833
by the general tone

12:30.875 --> 12:31.792
of the group.

12:31.834 --> 12:32.835
General tone?

12:32.877 --> 12:34.254
I haven't heard a peep

12:34.295 --> 12:36.005
out of any of these

12:34.295 --> 12:36.005
other women all day.

12:36.047 --> 12:37.591
What, you all agree

12:37.632 --> 12:39.800
with what Mrs. Control

12:37.632 --> 12:39.800
Freak here is saying?

12:39.842 --> 12:40.885
Well...

12:40.927 --> 12:41.886
Phyllis!

12:41.928 --> 12:44.805
My name isn't Phyllis!

12:44.847 --> 12:47.808
And... no,

12:44.847 --> 12:47.808
I don't feel that way.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.810
WOMAN:

12:47.850 --> 12:49.810
I don't either!

12:47.850 --> 12:49.810
I never liked...

12:49.852 --> 12:51.521
My husband told me

12:49.852 --> 12:51.521
I should stand up to you

12:51.563 --> 12:53.648
after I came home from

12:51.563 --> 12:53.648
that bake sale in tears.

12:53.690 --> 12:54.733
(women arguing)

12:54.773 --> 12:57.026
My soy burger...

12:57.068 --> 12:59.820
it's bleeding!

12:59.862 --> 13:01.281
This is meat!

13:01.322 --> 13:02.823
We're eating meat!

13:02.865 --> 13:04.242
Oh, my God!

13:04.284 --> 13:05.868
(retching)

13:05.910 --> 13:07.287
We're eating meat!

13:07.328 --> 13:09.830
(retching continues)

13:09.872 --> 13:11.249
(yelling)

13:18.673 --> 13:19.840
REESE:

13:18.673 --> 13:19.840
Get out of the way!

13:19.882 --> 13:21.092
ERASERHEAD:

13:19.882 --> 13:21.092
Come here!

13:21.884 --> 13:23.802
(all arguing)

13:35.189 --> 13:37.525
(people shrieking)

13:38.777 --> 13:40.654
Okay, the difference

13:38.777 --> 13:40.654
between a stink bomb

13:40.695 --> 13:42.322
and a level-three

13:40.695 --> 13:42.322
toxic biohazard

13:42.363 --> 13:44.949
is apparently two extra drops

13:42.363 --> 13:44.949
of sulfur tetra-oxide.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.494
I'm totally suing that Web site.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.370
I didn't do it!

13:55.918 --> 13:58.004
(people chattering)

14:03.009 --> 14:05.219
WOMAN:

14:03.009 --> 14:05.219
Where are you, honey?

14:06.179 --> 14:09.098
I want... our seat.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.891
(sobbing)

14:10.933 --> 14:12.268
I'm kind of conflicted.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.604
On the one hand,

14:12.310 --> 14:14.604
I ruined Caroline's picnic

14:14.646 --> 14:17.064
and very possibly endangered

14:14.646 --> 14:17.064
a hundred lives.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.818
On the other hand,

14:17.106 --> 14:19.818
now I don't have to do my act.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.778
(whimpering)

14:21.820 --> 14:23.904
Did you miss me?

14:23.946 --> 14:25.824
Mm-hmm.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.702
So who was that girl with

14:25.865 --> 14:28.702
her hands all over you?

14:28.743 --> 14:30.370
What girl, the paramedic?

14:30.411 --> 14:33.331
She was making sure

14:30.411 --> 14:33.331
I didn't inhale any toxic fumes.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.958
Oh, I'm sure you loved

14:33.373 --> 14:35.958
every moment of it.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.918
God, would you

14:36.000 --> 14:37.918
quit nagging me?

14:37.960 --> 14:40.004
Well, maybe if you paid a little

14:37.960 --> 14:40.004
more attention to me.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.088
More attention?

14:41.130 --> 14:42.215
You're smothering me.

14:42.256 --> 14:43.383
I need space.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.009
Oh, you'll get your space.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.845
We're through.

14:46.886 --> 14:47.970
Fine by me.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.975
Here's the school

14:50.390 --> 14:52.975
ring you gave me.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.145
The teddy bear key chain.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.859
Your shirt.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.859
Your two poems.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.943
The book you lent me.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.945
Your Depeche Mode tape!

15:04.987 --> 15:06.239
Oh, and here's your gum.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.950
I love Krelboynes.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.746
And I swear,

15:09.992 --> 15:12.746
I'm not just saying that.

15:12.787 --> 15:14.955
Why would I?

15:14.997 --> 15:16.957
Nice hang time.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.543
Well, it's really

15:16.999 --> 15:18.543
a simple function

15:18.585 --> 15:20.795
of the tensile strength

15:18.585 --> 15:20.795
of the elastic waistband.

15:20.837 --> 15:23.130
(sinister chuckle)

15:23.172 --> 15:25.925
(crying)

15:30.012 --> 15:31.472
I brought you a hamburger.

15:31.514 --> 15:34.183
This should

15:31.514 --> 15:34.183
make us even, right?

15:34.225 --> 15:36.143
(sniffling)

15:36.185 --> 15:38.438
Thank you.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.403
Is this meat?

15:45.445 --> 15:47.196
Uh, it might be.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.620
Look what I've been reduced to.

15:53.661 --> 15:54.995
(sobs)

15:55.037 --> 15:57.998
Okay, well, um...

15:58.040 --> 16:00.042
I'm going to...

16:00.084 --> 16:02.420
Oh, Malcolm, I'm so sorry.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.630
Huh?

16:03.671 --> 16:05.172
I know how much

16:05.214 --> 16:08.217
you were looking forward

16:05.214 --> 16:08.217
to doing your act...

16:08.259 --> 16:10.678
especially

16:08.259 --> 16:10.678
with your family here.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.722
I failed you.

16:12.764 --> 16:14.599
No, you didn't.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.017
Yes, I did.

16:17.059 --> 16:20.855
After today, they're going

16:17.059 --> 16:20.855
to fire my ass so fast.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.106
(crying)

16:24.066 --> 16:25.192
My parents were right.

16:25.234 --> 16:28.237
I never should have left

16:25.234 --> 16:28.237
the cannery.

16:28.279 --> 16:30.030
(sniffling)

16:30.072 --> 16:31.950
Want another hamburger?

16:35.119 --> 16:37.956
(crying):

16:35.119 --> 16:37.956
Yes!

16:39.540 --> 16:41.876
I do. I do.

16:41.918 --> 16:44.044
I really do.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.255
(muttering)

16:47.799 --> 16:49.258
(sobbing)

16:49.300 --> 16:50.885
Can you believe it? Meat.

16:50.927 --> 16:53.053
I don't know about you,

16:50.927 --> 16:53.053
but I'm outraged.

16:53.095 --> 16:56.056
I want you to know

16:53.095 --> 16:56.056
that I am going to see to it

16:56.098 --> 16:58.142
that you never serve

16:56.098 --> 16:58.142
on a school committee,

16:58.184 --> 17:00.645
hold an office or even

16:58.184 --> 17:00.645
so much as set foot

17:00.687 --> 17:03.230
in a PTA meeting

17:00.687 --> 17:03.230
as long as I can help it.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.065
Is that a promise, lady?

17:05.107 --> 17:06.567
'Cause I'd really like

17:05.107 --> 17:06.567
to get that in writing.

17:06.609 --> 17:08.444
I should have expected as much

17:08.486 --> 17:10.989
from the mother

17:08.486 --> 17:10.989
of a foul-mouth thug.

17:11.030 --> 17:14.408
What he's even doing

17:11.030 --> 17:14.408
in this class, I don't know.

17:16.118 --> 17:17.662
Oh, I see you

17:16.118 --> 17:17.662
made a friend.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.747
Yeah. Tomorrow we're going

17:17.704 --> 17:19.747
shopping for shoes.

17:19.789 --> 17:20.748
Oh.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.082
Academic circus?

17:22.124 --> 17:23.918
Well, you certainly got

17:22.124 --> 17:23.918
the circus part right.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.503
This is the biggest

17:23.960 --> 17:25.503
debacle I've ever seen.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.754
I guarantee you

17:25.545 --> 17:26.754
Principal Littledove

17:26.796 --> 17:28.088
is going to hear

17:26.796 --> 17:28.088
about this.

17:28.130 --> 17:31.091
Exactly.

17:28.130 --> 17:31.091
He sure will,

17:28.130 --> 17:31.091
from all of us.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.677
Can I ask you

17:31.133 --> 17:32.677
a question?

17:32.719 --> 17:35.680
Yes. All women suck.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.516
No, I mean...

17:35.722 --> 17:38.516
you'd still like me

17:38.558 --> 17:41.101
even if you found out

17:38.558 --> 17:41.101
I was a freak, right?

17:41.143 --> 17:43.187
And the family wouldn't treat me

17:41.143 --> 17:43.187
any different, right?

17:43.229 --> 17:45.773
Dude, we already

17:43.229 --> 17:45.773
know you're smart.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.107
Yeah, but...

17:47.149 --> 17:48.776
Never mind.

17:48.818 --> 17:50.987
Just don't say I

17:48.818 --> 17:50.987
didn't warn you.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.825
Look, it's Malcolm!

17:55.867 --> 17:58.118
GIRL: Hey, hey,

17:55.867 --> 17:58.118
Malcolm's going to do it, guys!

17:58.160 --> 17:59.495
The PTA is

17:58.160 --> 17:59.495
online, missy.

17:59.537 --> 18:02.040
Are you aware of the

17:59.537 --> 18:02.040
power of the Internet?

18:02.081 --> 18:04.375
(excited chatter)

18:04.417 --> 18:06.377
Hey, everyone, look!

18:06.419 --> 18:08.713
Look, Malcolm's doing it.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.713
He's doing it.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.172
Hey, shut the hell up!

18:10.214 --> 18:12.091
(chatter stops)

18:19.181 --> 18:20.725
Um...

18:20.767 --> 18:24.062
could somebody please

18:20.767 --> 18:24.062
show me some credit cards?

18:28.399 --> 18:29.776
Okay.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.151
The numbers on them are:

18:31.193 --> 18:35.155
3699-7412-6823-

18:35.197 --> 18:38.158
9140 and... 3424-

18:38.200 --> 18:42.329
1804-1835-3668.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.123
He's right!

18:49.796 --> 18:51.130
Okay.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.093
If you add the individual

18:52.632 --> 18:55.093
digits on each card,

18:55.134 --> 18:56.844
you get 74 and 66.

18:56.886 --> 19:00.180
If you multiply those numbers,

18:56.886 --> 19:00.180
you get 4,884.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.266
How do we even know

19:00.222 --> 19:02.266
he's right?

19:02.308 --> 19:04.518
Oh, he's right.

19:06.228 --> 19:09.189
MALCOLM:

19:06.228 --> 19:09.189
4,884 squared

19:09.231 --> 19:12.359
is 23,853,456.

19:12.401 --> 19:15.195
The square root

19:12.401 --> 19:15.195
of 4,884

19:15.237 --> 19:18.116
is 69 and 885/1,000.

19:18.157 --> 19:23.121
The square root of that

19:18.157 --> 19:23.121
is eight and 3,597/10,000.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.082
Factor it!

19:26.124 --> 19:28.208
The factors are 232 and 73.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.627
Multiply it by pi.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.587
26 and 261/1,000.

19:31.629 --> 19:34.465
Cube it!

19:31.629 --> 19:34.465
584 and 214/1,000.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.424
What's the arc tangent?

19:35.466 --> 19:36.801
89 and 9/10 degrees.

19:36.843 --> 19:40.096
Natural log!

19:36.843 --> 19:40.096
6 and 3,699/10,000.

19:40.138 --> 19:41.889
What's the reciprocal?

19:40.138 --> 19:41.889
17/10,000.

19:41.931 --> 19:42.640
In base eight!

19:42.682 --> 19:43.891
11,431.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.225
What's the capitol

19:43.933 --> 19:45.225
of Iceland?

19:45.267 --> 19:47.186
Reykjavik--

19:45.267 --> 19:47.186
but that's not math.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.332
Why can't you do that?

20:08.374 --> 20:09.667
Cellular mitosis.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.378
What are we paying

20:09.709 --> 20:12.378
your tutor for?

20:18.926 --> 20:20.928
Do you have

20:18.926 --> 20:20.928
any brothers?

20:20.970 --> 20:22.722
No.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.557
(sobs)

20:26.392 --> 20:27.727
Hey.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.228
Hi.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.733
So, um... how you been?

20:33.774 --> 20:36.027
Fine.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.279
You look good.

20:39.321 --> 20:40.573
Yes, it was.

20:40.614 --> 20:42.282
It was a

20:40.614 --> 20:42.282
wonderful circus.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.451
So many people

20:42.324 --> 20:44.451
were worried...

20:44.493 --> 20:46.996
Was it as bad as

20:44.493 --> 20:46.996
I think it was?

20:47.038 --> 20:49.289
Man... you killed.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.291
That's what I

20:49.331 --> 20:51.291
was afraid of.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.377
Sorry you didn't

20:51.333 --> 20:53.377
get to do your act.

20:53.419 --> 20:56.214
Shove... the sympathy...

20:56.255 --> 20:58.340
showboat.

20:58.382 --> 21:00.467
He fell on his butt

20:58.382 --> 21:00.467
and everything.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.261
He was just, like, dazed.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.357
Is Malcolm a robot?

21:16.358 --> 21:18.611
No, son, he's just smart.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.781
Very, very,

21:21.822 --> 21:24.867
very, very, very,

21:21.822 --> 21:24.867
very smart.

21:27.036 --> 21:27.995
Hey, Malcolm...

21:29.455 --> 21:32.250
How many fingers

21:29.455 --> 21:32.250
am I holding up?

21:32.291 --> 21:33.333
(laughter)

21:33.375 --> 21:35.753
Shut up.

21:36.670 --> 21:38.338
Analyze what I had for lunch.

21:38.380 --> 21:39.339
(burps)

21:38.380 --> 21:39.339
(laughter)

21:39.381 --> 21:40.967
Get off me, you moron.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.342
You know what

21:41.008 --> 21:42.342
I don't understand?

21:42.384 --> 21:43.844
How you can rattle off

21:42.384 --> 21:43.844
all those numbers,

21:43.886 --> 21:45.387
but you can't remember

21:43.886 --> 21:45.387
to brush your teeth.

21:45.429 --> 21:47.347
HAL: Hey, who's for

21:45.429 --> 21:47.347
Burger Barn?

21:47.389 --> 21:49.767
(cheering)

21:49.809 --> 21:51.644
Burger Barn!

21:51.685 --> 21:53.687
(laughter)
