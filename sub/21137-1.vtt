33:47.276 --> 33:48.360
Do you hear me?

33:57.828 --> 33:59.163
Please.

34:00.205 --> 34:01.623
Just let us go.

34:02.499 --> 34:03.959
Yeah, I did that.

34:05.169 --> 34:06.295
Begged.

34:06.837 --> 34:07.921
Pleaded.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.507
Just like you're doing.

34:15.804 --> 34:17.764
Tell me what you want.

34:17.848 --> 34:19.099
I'll do it.

34:24.063 --> 34:25.438
So, tell me
what you want me to do

34:25.522 --> 34:27.149
- and I'll do it.
- Shut up.

34:32.487 --> 34:33.864
Just tell me what you want...

34:33.947 --> 34:35.657
There's fuckin' nothing
you can do.

38:53.749 --> 38:55.125
You kind of stink, kid.

38:55.542 --> 38:57.336
You want me to take
your socks off?

39:08.055 --> 39:09.514
My name's Arlen.

39:10.557 --> 39:11.850
What's your name?

39:17.856 --> 39:20.150
Look, no one cares
about you now.

39:23.403 --> 39:25.947
I could have just left you
out there in the desert.

39:28.075 --> 39:29.785
Is that where you wanna be?

39:30.369 --> 39:31.495
Hmm?

39:36.291 --> 39:38.085
Now, you like this bunny,
don't you?

39:42.005 --> 39:43.382
Do you wanna keep him?

39:52.933 --> 39:55.352
Then, you got to do
exactly what I say.

41:19.853 --> 41:22.355
That dead woman over there.

41:22.814 --> 41:24.566
There was... a kid was with her.

41:25.484 --> 41:27.152
Did you see this kid?

41:28.904 --> 41:30.238
Did you see her?

41:33.950 --> 41:35.160
Did you see her?

41:38.914 --> 41:40.248
You better start talking,
old man.

41:45.712 --> 41:46.880
Did you see her?

41:51.176 --> 41:52.469
What you want?

44:46.601 --> 44:48.269
Keep it steady.

44:49.938 --> 44:51.523
Nice straight line.

44:54.567 --> 44:55.694
Let me see.

44:58.279 --> 44:59.489
That's good.

45:02.575 --> 45:04.077
A little bit more down here.

46:21.821 --> 46:23.948
Yeah, baby.

46:33.708 --> 46:37.337
Come on, baby! Do that move!

46:37.420 --> 46:38.671
Move it down.

46:44.594 --> 46:45.970
Dang, baby!

46:46.763 --> 46:48.389
People of Comfort,

46:48.473 --> 46:50.141
good evening!

46:53.520 --> 46:55.605
Give us The Dream!

46:56.147 --> 46:58.441
Give us The Dream!

46:58.691 --> 47:00.985
Give us The Dream!

47:01.778 --> 47:03.822
Give us The Dream!

47:04.572 --> 47:06.574
Give us The Dream!

47:07.075 --> 47:08.493
Make some noise

47:08.576 --> 47:10.829
for the one and only!

47:11.621 --> 47:18.461
The Dream!

47:29.722 --> 47:31.724
Come on, Dream!
Change my life!

47:32.767 --> 47:36.020
He looked at me!
He looked at me!

47:36.104 --> 47:37.856
- We love you!
- I love you, too.

47:39.816 --> 47:42.527
Heal my life with The Dream!

47:44.654 --> 47:47.574
I've been wanting
to dream all my life!

47:49.117 --> 47:51.327
Come on now, Dream!

47:56.457 --> 47:58.459
I love you, Dream!

48:03.923 --> 48:05.425
I've got a question.

48:07.844 --> 48:08.928
Why are we out here?

48:09.012 --> 48:10.471
Just what are we doing
in the middle

48:10.555 --> 48:12.515
of the goddamn desert tonight?

48:12.599 --> 48:15.685
Jimmy! Jimmy!

48:17.020 --> 48:18.354
That's right. That's right.

48:18.438 --> 48:20.398
You want that music
only Jimmy can make.

48:25.862 --> 48:28.698
Let me tell you
something about Jimmy.

48:30.241 --> 48:32.076
You know why Jimmy's here?

48:32.160 --> 48:33.828
- Why?
- Jimmy!

48:33.912 --> 48:36.915
- Why?
- He's Bad Batch.

48:36.998 --> 48:38.374
Yeah, yeah!

48:38.458 --> 48:40.168
Bad Batch, fucker!

48:40.251 --> 48:43.129
Nonfunctioning
member of society.

48:43.212 --> 48:45.048
That's what they told him.

48:45.965 --> 48:47.342
That's right.

48:48.384 --> 48:50.178
All of us here,

48:50.762 --> 48:52.180
we weren't good enough.

48:52.513 --> 48:53.973
Smart enough.

48:54.057 --> 48:55.600
- Yeah!
- Young enough.

48:55.975 --> 48:57.477
- Healthy enough.
- You're right!

48:57.560 --> 48:58.853
Wealthy enough.

48:59.354 --> 49:01.230
Sane enough.

49:02.649 --> 49:04.400
Freaks.

49:05.944 --> 49:07.695
Parasites.

49:07.946 --> 49:10.490
Bad Batch!
Motherfucking Bad Batch!

49:10.573 --> 49:12.575
This here is the Bad Batch.

49:12.659 --> 49:15.244
Bad Batch, bitches!

49:15.328 --> 49:17.956
We ain't good. We're bad.

49:18.039 --> 49:20.708
Yeah, yeah,
that's right, Bad Batch!

49:20.792 --> 49:22.835
Yeah, Bad Batch.

49:25.463 --> 49:26.673
That's right.

49:27.882 --> 49:29.300
We're bad, baby!

49:30.093 --> 49:32.220
Now, there's only one rule here,

49:33.221 --> 49:34.806
and it's this.

49:36.265 --> 49:38.309
It's time to wake up.

49:38.685 --> 49:41.771
It's time to find... The Dream.

49:42.021 --> 49:43.021
The Dream!

49:50.113 --> 49:51.614
All glory to The Dream!

49:56.577 --> 49:59.372
We're a Bad Batch,
motherfuckers!

49:59.455 --> 50:01.582
Bad Batch, motherfuckers!

51:24.749 --> 51:26.000
Yeah!

51:27.710 --> 51:29.879
Yee-haw!

51:35.009 --> 51:36.427
- Yeah.
- What's wrong with that?

51:44.268 --> 51:45.853
Is this your rabbit?

52:45.663 --> 52:46.663
<i>Where is she?</i>

52:47.373 --> 52:48.666
<i>She was just right here?</i>

52:48.749 --> 52:50.084
<i>That kid.</i>

52:50.543 --> 52:52.461
<i>She was right here a second ago.</i>

52:52.879 --> 52:54.714
<i>She was right here a second ago.</i>

52:55.089 --> 52:56.382
<i>She's got to be here somewhere.</i>

52:56.465 --> 52:58.176
<i>Where did that kid go?</i>

52:58.259 --> 52:59.719
<i>I lost her.</i>

52:59.802 --> 53:01.846
<i>That kid. I hope she's okay.</i>

53:01.929 --> 53:03.598
<i>What did I do?
She's got to be here.</i>

53:03.681 --> 53:05.183
<i>I know she's got to be here.</i>

53:05.933 --> 53:07.643
<i>She's got to be here somewhere.</i>

53:09.145 --> 53:11.689
<i>What did I do? What did I do?</i>

53:12.690 --> 53:15.067
<i>Where did that kid go?</i>

53:20.489 --> 53:22.992
Hey, you guys seen a little girl?

53:30.166 --> 53:31.959
Hey, you seen a kid?

53:37.089 --> 53:39.050
<i>What am I gonna do now?</i>

53:44.055 --> 53:47.016
<i>I hate this place.</i>

53:47.099 --> 53:49.852
<i>What is this place?</i>

53:49.936 --> 53:51.896
<i>This place.</i>

53:51.979 --> 53:54.607
<i>What is this place?</i>

53:54.690 --> 53:56.651
<i>What is this place?</i>

54:05.159 --> 54:06.911
<i>Here's what you do.</i>

54:06.994 --> 54:09.247
<i>Okay, here's what you do.</i>

54:10.081 --> 54:12.041
<i>Go somewhere. Go far away.</i>

54:12.124 --> 54:13.876
<i>You go far away.</i>

54:13.960 --> 54:15.086
<i>Somewhere. Leave Comfort.</i>

54:15.169 --> 54:16.796
<i>Leave Comfort.</i>

54:17.380 --> 54:19.131
<i>Just go for a walk.</i>

54:20.925 --> 54:22.677
<i>Just go for a walk.</i>

54:25.680 --> 54:28.140
<i>Somewhere. Anywhere.</i>

55:03.592 --> 55:05.136
<i>Wow.</i>

55:05.219 --> 55:08.723
<i>It's so big.</i>

55:08.806 --> 55:10.308
<i>Wow.</i>

55:10.391 --> 55:13.602
<i>So big.</i>

55:15.896 --> 55:18.357
<i>Wow.</i>

55:18.441 --> 55:19.984
<i>It's so big.</i>

55:20.067 --> 55:22.069
<i>Wow! It's so big.</i>

55:22.153 --> 55:26.157
<i>It's pretty, so pretty.</i>

55:29.410 --> 55:31.579
<i>Is that what
it always looks like?</i>

55:32.580 --> 55:35.374
<i>Doesn't always look like that.</i>

56:01.984 --> 56:03.110
<i>Wow.</i>

57:36.620 --> 57:39.373
<i>Thought it was
pretty at first, but...</i>

57:41.459 --> 57:44.044
<i>now, I'm not so sure.</i>

57:49.341 --> 57:52.303
<i>I don't even really know
what it is.</i>

57:59.185 --> 58:01.270
<i>Do you?</i>

58:36.889 --> 58:38.390
<i>You're big.</i>

58:45.397 --> 58:47.483
<i>Strange, isn't it?</i>

58:49.318 --> 58:50.736
<i>Here we are</i>

58:51.570 --> 58:54.573
<i>in the darkest corner
of this Earth,</i>

58:56.283 --> 58:58.786
<i>and we're afraid
of our own kind.</i>

59:55.968 --> 59:57.511
<i>Hmm.</i>

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.628
You know where you are?

01:00:46.268 --> 01:00:48.687
You are a long way from Comfort.

01:00:49.104 --> 01:00:50.814
And without this,

01:00:51.357 --> 01:00:53.067
you go nowhere.

01:01:23.222 --> 01:01:25.057
Did you see a kid
look like that?

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:34.525
Did you see her?

01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:36.819
No.

01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:49.581
I'm going
to take you to Comfort,

01:01:49.665 --> 01:01:51.250
and you will go inside

01:01:51.333 --> 01:01:53.001
and find her for me.

01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:18.318
Listen to me good.

01:02:20.779 --> 01:02:24.825
I don't care
about nothing or nobody

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:26.952
except that little girl.

01:02:30.956 --> 01:02:32.499
And I'm going to kill you

01:02:32.583 --> 01:02:34.334
if you don't find her for me.

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:37.713
Comprende?

01:02:42.968 --> 01:02:44.261
Mm.

01:03:48.075 --> 01:03:49.326
Vámonos!

01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:50.828
I'm thirsty.

01:03:51.787 --> 01:03:54.331
This make you more thirsty.

01:03:57.292 --> 01:03:58.752
We got guns at the wall.

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:00.838
They'll shoot if they see you.

01:04:02.381 --> 01:04:03.757
Mm.

01:04:08.387 --> 01:04:09.555
So what?

01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:11.390
That's your kid?

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:15.811
What if I can't find her?

01:04:18.856 --> 01:04:20.858
You will find her.

01:05:38.226 --> 01:05:40.187
Trade you for that leg.

01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:23.522
I'm being friendly, dude.

01:06:24.523 --> 01:06:26.316
I can just keep it all
for myself.

01:06:26.692 --> 01:06:27.985
It's up to you.

01:07:05.022 --> 01:07:06.398
Wait!

01:07:06.481 --> 01:07:07.733
No!

01:07:15.323 --> 01:07:16.700
Mm!

01:07:18.577 --> 01:07:20.579
Fuck.

01:07:20.662 --> 01:07:22.581
Mm-hmm.

01:07:25.917 --> 01:07:27.127
No.

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:29.379
No, no, no, no! No!

01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:46.146
Let me go!

01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:48.982
Aah!

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:10.564
Vámonos!

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:55.400
Would you turn around,
please?

01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:41.464
What's your deal?

01:11:42.257 --> 01:11:44.009
How come
you're in the Bad Batch?

01:11:49.556 --> 01:11:50.974
Gang related?

01:11:55.979 --> 01:11:57.689
Drug related?

01:12:03.111 --> 01:12:04.696
Illegal.

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:07.157
No papers.

01:12:10.535 --> 01:12:12.162
You a Mexican?

01:12:14.372 --> 01:12:17.125
Cubano, from Havana.

01:12:23.548 --> 01:12:25.467
I heard of Cuba.

01:12:26.301 --> 01:12:28.178
That's in the tropics, right?

01:12:29.304 --> 01:12:30.597
Near Hawaii?

01:13:06.091 --> 01:13:07.801
Here is Cuba.

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:11.096
I am born here, in Havana.

01:13:11.179 --> 01:13:14.766
I come with a boat to America
when I'm 16.

01:13:15.767 --> 01:13:17.185
To Miami.

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:18.560
Miami.

01:13:18.937 --> 01:13:20.271
What did you do there?

01:13:20.688 --> 01:13:22.816
Like, what did you do in Miami?

01:13:25.235 --> 01:13:26.736
A lot of thing.

01:13:27.445 --> 01:13:28.822
I make tattoos,

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.782
construction.

01:13:30.865 --> 01:13:31.991
I do this, that.

01:13:32.075 --> 01:13:33.326
No big deal.

01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:37.622
I got this one when I was 13.

01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:40.500
And this.

01:13:52.637 --> 01:13:54.013
See this one?

01:13:55.723 --> 01:13:58.059
It's from the first boy
I ever loved.

01:13:58.435 --> 01:14:00.186
He was a musician.

01:14:00.728 --> 01:14:03.356
We both got matching ones
at the same time.

01:14:07.735 --> 01:14:09.320
And this one,

01:14:09.404 --> 01:14:10.780
5040.

01:14:13.992 --> 01:14:15.326
What's your number?

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:22.375
Come on.

01:14:23.168 --> 01:14:24.335
What's your number?

01:14:32.177 --> 01:14:33.595
What's the big deal?

01:14:35.889 --> 01:14:37.807
Just show me your number.

01:15:09.088 --> 01:15:10.465
Your kind,

01:15:11.049 --> 01:15:12.342
you're evil.

01:15:13.885 --> 01:15:15.178
That's what you are.

01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:16.513
Evil.

01:15:20.308 --> 01:15:22.227
You don't see things
how they are.

01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:25.396
You only see things
how you are.

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:26.773
I don't care.

01:15:27.732 --> 01:15:28.942
I hate you.

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:30.527
Get it?

01:15:33.488 --> 01:15:35.198
I hate all of y'all.

01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:42.288
No problema para mí.

01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:44.249
It's okay.

01:15:56.594 --> 01:15:58.680
Doesn't change nothing for me.

01:16:00.098 --> 01:16:02.475
Doesn't change nothing for you.

01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:20.285
Ohh.

01:16:27.417 --> 01:16:28.459
Ohh!

01:16:43.766 --> 01:16:45.184
Come on. Come with me.

01:16:45.268 --> 01:16:46.728
Come on.

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:01.034
Let's go, man. I'm getting
the fuck out of here.

01:17:07.624 --> 01:17:09.626
Come on.
Hurry the fuck up.

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:16.424
Let's go now.

01:17:31.064 --> 01:17:32.398
Open up.

01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:37.487
Close it up.

01:17:40.365 --> 01:17:42.575
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's going on?

01:17:42.659 --> 01:17:43.660
What's your number, fool?

01:17:43.743 --> 01:17:45.244
5828.

01:17:45.328 --> 01:17:47.038
Been out in the desert
two days, man.

01:17:47.121 --> 01:17:48.206
I need some food.

01:17:48.289 --> 01:17:49.957
Are you guys gonna help me
out or what?

01:17:50.041 --> 01:17:51.542
What's up
with the white girl, man?

01:17:51.626 --> 01:17:54.170
Found her ass out there
with one of them Bridge people.

01:17:54.253 --> 01:17:55.380
All right, kick back, homey.

01:17:55.463 --> 01:17:57.023

01:25:51.272 --> 01:25:52.314
No.

Excuse me, sir.

anywhere?

01:25:59.864 --> 01:26:00.781
Uh-uh.

01:26:00.865 --> 01:26:02.408
No?

01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:05.619
Can you look out

01:26:12.168 --> 01:26:13.270
Oh, he ain't
ever gonna be wasted.

01:26:13.294 --> 01:26:15.254
Hey, have you guys
seen a little girl?

01:26:15.671 --> 01:26:18.132
I ain't seen shit, man.

01:26:25.347 --> 01:26:27.516
I wish they'd stop
making pennies.

01:26:28.809 --> 01:26:30.186
I hate pennies.

01:26:30.269 --> 01:26:31.353
I hate 'em!

01:26:31.687 --> 01:26:32.563
Hey!

01:26:32.646 --> 01:26:34.648
- I keep losing things.
- Hey.

01:26:34.732 --> 01:26:36.817
Don't wanna be a loser.
I wanna be a finder.

01:26:36.901 --> 01:26:39.069
Finder finds things.
Loser loses them.

01:26:39.486 --> 01:26:41.280
Yeah. I need to find a kid.

01:26:41.363 --> 01:26:42.531
A little girl.

01:26:42.781 --> 01:26:44.033
Yeah.

01:26:44.116 --> 01:26:46.243
- She's about this tall.
- Yeah.

01:26:46.327 --> 01:26:47.661
- You've seen her?
- Yeah.

01:26:47.745 --> 01:26:49.246
- Where?
- Hey, you wanna play

01:26:49.330 --> 01:26:50.331
with my puzzle?

01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:53.959
You wanna play?

01:26:55.211 --> 01:26:57.379
No, I'm not gonna play
with your puzzle.

01:26:57.463 --> 01:26:59.506
- Thank you.
- I'll call you later.

01:32:07.523 --> 01:32:09.441
Yeah, baby!

01:32:10.776 --> 01:32:12.402

01:32:36.718 --> 01:32:38.512
Yeah.

That's the economy of Comfort

01:33:38.989 --> 01:33:40.866
sitting right in front of you.

01:33:43.493 --> 01:33:45.329
Right beautiful.

01:33:48.832 --> 01:33:51.793
See, you can catch
more flies with honey.

01:33:53.629 --> 01:33:55.797
But who wants flies?

01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:03.680
Remind me your name again,

01:34:03.764 --> 01:34:05.140
Sweetheart.

01:34:06.141 --> 01:34:07.684
It's Arlen.

01:34:10.145 --> 01:34:12.272
Let me ask you
a question, Arlen.

01:34:12.773 --> 01:34:14.941
When you shit here in Comfort,

01:34:15.025 --> 01:34:16.568
your shit goes away.

01:34:16.652 --> 01:34:18.153
That accurate?

01:34:18.236 --> 01:34:19.655
I guess.

01:34:19.738 --> 01:34:21.156
You shit.

01:34:21.239 --> 01:34:23.075
It leaves.

01:34:23.158 --> 01:34:25.452
You know why it leaves?

01:34:27.704 --> 01:34:29.164
Um...

01:34:30.832 --> 01:34:34.753
because the toilet
takes it someplace?

01:34:35.796 --> 01:34:37.464
Yes, it does.

01:34:39.424 --> 01:34:41.301
Takes it where it takes it...

01:34:43.053 --> 01:34:44.805
because of me.

01:34:49.017 --> 01:34:51.311
'Cause I hate the idea

01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:53.855
that my sons and daughters

01:34:53.939 --> 01:34:56.566
would have to stew
in their own shit.

01:35:00.529 --> 01:35:02.656
Cows stand in their shit.

01:35:04.908 --> 01:35:06.827
They stand in their shit...

01:35:07.953 --> 01:35:09.996
'cause they're cows.

01:35:10.372 --> 01:35:12.457
Pigs stand in their shit...

01:35:13.166 --> 01:35:15.043
'cause they're pigs.

01:35:18.046 --> 01:35:19.756
Some misbehaving humans

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:21.550
been making hamburgers
out of my sons

01:35:21.633 --> 01:35:22.968
and daughters.

01:35:24.094 --> 01:35:26.012
We are not cows.

01:35:27.139 --> 01:35:29.391
We don't stand in our shit.

01:35:30.809 --> 01:35:32.352
Reason we don't...

01:35:33.437 --> 01:35:35.814
is because
I won't let that happen.

01:35:37.274 --> 01:35:39.151
I got each and every toilet
in Comfort

01:35:39.234 --> 01:35:42.362
taking that shit
from all your little asses

01:35:43.029 --> 01:35:44.281
and sending it down the pipes

01:35:44.364 --> 01:35:45.699
till it reaches a place

01:35:45.782 --> 01:35:48.076
where no one thinks about it

01:35:48.827 --> 01:35:50.245
and no one smells it.

01:35:51.288 --> 01:35:52.998
Ain't that nice of me?

01:36:07.512 --> 01:36:08.972
But you don't like it here,

01:36:10.056 --> 01:36:11.641
do you?

01:36:16.605 --> 01:36:18.064
No, I just...

01:36:20.984 --> 01:36:23.320
Costs a lot to be here.

01:36:24.905 --> 01:36:27.157
Cost you an arm and a leg.

01:36:30.243 --> 01:36:32.370
Where would you rather be?

01:36:47.135 --> 01:36:48.512
It's all right.

01:37:04.110 --> 01:37:06.530
You know what I see
when I look at you?

01:37:08.073 --> 01:37:10.700
A sailboat out in the sea...

01:37:12.619 --> 01:37:14.454
with no wind.

01:37:19.751 --> 01:37:22.337
What is it you want, Arlen?

01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:25.757
If you could have one thing,

01:37:26.174 --> 01:37:27.425
anything,

01:37:28.510 --> 01:37:30.011
what would it be?

01:37:31.096 --> 01:37:31.930
Anything?

01:37:32.013 --> 01:37:33.849
Anything at all.

01:37:39.062 --> 01:37:40.647
A time machine.

01:37:43.066 --> 01:37:44.442
Why?

01:37:45.777 --> 01:37:47.279
So I could go back.

01:37:47.654 --> 01:37:49.739
Fix things.

01:37:50.949 --> 01:37:52.367
Make it better.

01:37:55.287 --> 01:37:57.414
All the things you've done

01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:00.333
have put you right here,

01:38:01.167 --> 01:38:02.669
on this couch,

01:38:02.919 --> 01:38:04.588
in this room,

01:38:04.671 --> 01:38:06.506
with me.

01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:13.930
Close your eyes.

01:38:17.684 --> 01:38:19.185
Close them.

01:38:28.737 --> 01:38:31.323
What do you really want?

01:38:37.412 --> 01:38:40.248
I wanna be the solution
for something.

01:38:50.175 --> 01:38:52.010
You know what this is?

01:38:52.844 --> 01:38:54.429
It's a tomato.

01:38:57.182 --> 01:38:58.600
First,

01:39:00.518 --> 01:39:02.270
it was a seed.

01:39:04.105 --> 01:39:06.107
You take care of a garden,

01:39:06.733 --> 01:39:09.027
and it takes care of you back.

01:39:09.444 --> 01:39:10.987
You feed it,

01:39:11.529 --> 01:39:13.490
it feeds you.

01:39:13.865 --> 01:39:15.325
Few things in this world

01:39:15.408 --> 01:39:16.910
operate like that,

01:39:17.243 --> 01:39:18.954
fair and square.

01:39:21.998 --> 01:39:24.334
It just needs a place to grow.

01:39:29.965 --> 01:39:33.551
It grows and grows.

01:39:35.345 --> 01:39:37.097
Then it comes out

01:39:37.847 --> 01:39:39.808
and it's part of the world.

01:39:41.142 --> 01:39:43.687
Because you know what
The Dream really is?

01:39:46.314 --> 01:39:47.607
It's life.

01:39:48.024 --> 01:39:49.734
Life is The Dream.

01:39:51.277 --> 01:39:53.196
The only dream.

01:40:08.461 --> 01:40:10.213
I want The Dream.

01:40:10.922 --> 01:40:12.674
What dream is that?

01:40:13.341 --> 01:40:14.926
This one here.

01:40:16.594 --> 01:40:18.388
Like they have.

01:40:33.486 --> 01:40:35.780
Make up a room for our guest.

01:42:06.287 --> 01:42:08.123
Is everything okay?

01:42:27.392 --> 01:42:30.436
Hey. I'm sorry.

01:42:32.355 --> 01:42:34.440
I guess I'm just a bit nervous.

01:42:34.524 --> 01:42:36.025
