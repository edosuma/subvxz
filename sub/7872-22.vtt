00:20.854 --> 00:22.087
(grunts)

00:23.990 --> 00:26.525
D'oh!

00:26.527 --> 00:28.227
(grunts)

00:29.195 --> 00:30.496
(all scream)

00:30.498 --> 00:31.997
Oh, my God, Morty,
what did you do?

00:31.999 --> 00:33.799
You killed the Simpsons, Morty!
Oh, my God, no!

00:33.801 --> 00:35.167
No, I-I-I-I didn't mean to!
Oh, no, no!

00:35.169 --> 00:36.668
This is horrible!
I killed the Simpsons!

00:36.670 --> 00:39.304
God, look at the baby one!
Oh, my God, Morty!

00:39.306 --> 00:40.806
You killed the entire
Simpsons, Morty!

00:40.808 --> 00:43.142
They're a beloved
(belches) family, Morty!

00:43.144 --> 00:45.010
They're-they're-they're-they're
a national treasure.

00:45.012 --> 00:46.645
And you killed them.
I-I-I-I'm just a kid!

00:46.647 --> 00:47.646
I'm just a kid!
I don't want to go to jail!

00:47.648 --> 00:48.680
Relax, Morty, calm down.

00:48.682 --> 00:50.816
We'll take care of it.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.518
Okay, I want you to take
that vial of Simpsons' goo

00:52.520 --> 00:54.486
and this picture
to this address.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.688
They'll make us new Simpsons--
you understand me, Morty?

00:56.690 --> 00:58.657
Me?! W-W-What are you gonna do?
Morty,

00:58.659 --> 00:59.992
I got to clean this place up

00:59.994 --> 01:01.326
before somebody comes
snooping around.

01:01.328 --> 01:02.995
You know how many
characters there are

01:02.997 --> 01:04.363
in   <i>The Simpsons</i>Morty?
There's, like, a billion

01:04.365 --> 01:06.031
(belches):
chara... characters.

01:06.033 --> 01:08.033
They did an episode where
George Bush was their neighbor.

01:08.035 --> 01:10.102
All right, can't
argue with that.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.978
(spits)

01:25.185 --> 01:27.252
(speaking in native tongue)

01:53.580 --> 01:55.047
Hi-diddly-ho, neighbor!

01:55.049 --> 01:57.249
Looks like you got
a spaceship in your...

01:57.251 --> 01:59.785
Who are you?

02:06.392 --> 02:08.393
Rick, I'm back!
Wake up! Wake up!

02:08.395 --> 02:10.395
Geez, it's about time, Morty.

02:10.397 --> 02:12.464
Give me those.

02:16.069 --> 02:18.470
(grunting, moaning)

02:21.274 --> 02:22.441
Huh, wow.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.576
Hey, Morty, a little tip.
(belches)

02:24.578 --> 02:26.612
Don't clean DNA vials
with your spit!

02:26.614 --> 02:28.981
Let's go.
I'm driving this time.

02:30.950 --> 02:34.319
Aw, no more guest
animators, man!

02:42.929 --> 02:44.129
Okay, children.

02:44.131 --> 02:45.430
I think it's safe now

02:45.432 --> 02:47.866
to put on your math T-shirts.

02:49.302 --> 02:50.969
Wait here.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.304
(grunts)
Nerd!

02:52.306 --> 02:54.806
Model U.N.,
and step on it!

02:54.808 --> 02:56.108
Ha-ha!

02:56.110 --> 02:58.544
(laughing)

03:00.313 --> 03:02.114
Very good.

03:02.116 --> 03:04.950
That is really... Oh!

03:04.952 --> 03:06.952
Dog in box.

03:06.954 --> 03:09.354
Genius.

03:13.326 --> 03:16.161
All right, let's meet our two
teams of Mathletes, shall we?

03:16.163 --> 03:19.665
First, the Springfield
Elementary Action Fractions!

03:19.667 --> 03:21.166
They rhyme and they...

03:21.168 --> 03:22.334
(groans)

03:22.336 --> 03:24.503
And, uh, from the right side
of the tracks,

03:24.505 --> 03:27.005
the Waverly Hills Elementary

03:27.007 --> 03:29.174
No Equals.
They're spoiled and rich.

03:29.176 --> 03:32.678
Yo! What did the right angle
say to the wider angle?

03:32.680 --> 03:35.347
Well, not knowing these fellows,
I-I couldn't say.

03:35.349 --> 03:36.481
You're obtuse!

03:36.483 --> 03:37.983
(all laughing)

03:37.985 --> 03:39.685
(groans)

03:39.687 --> 03:41.987
Now, let's welcome
our celebrity guests,

03:41.989 --> 03:44.489
former winners
of this very contest

03:44.491 --> 03:46.525
and current high-flying--
yes, you heard me--

03:46.527 --> 03:48.360
I said high-flying,
high flying--

03:48.362 --> 03:50.662
tech entrepreneurs!

03:50.664 --> 03:52.664
Gary, Doug and Benjamin,

03:52.666 --> 03:54.366
who invented Whereditgo.

03:54.368 --> 03:57.169
That's an app that finds
the other apps on your phone.

03:57.171 --> 04:00.872
Enables you to glayvin with
your friends' mobile hoyvin.

04:00.874 --> 04:03.208
One year ago, we
were dateless nerds

04:03.210 --> 04:05.043
living in our
mothers' basements.

04:05.045 --> 04:08.380
Now the basement we live in
is in a giant mansion.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.215
Yeah!
Yeah!

04:10.217 --> 04:12.684
And we own some kind
of sports team.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.019
(laughs)

04:14.021 --> 04:15.554
All right, calm down,
just calm down.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.589
Now, here to support
these fine student scholars

04:17.591 --> 04:20.058
is the man who loves math...

04:20.060 --> 04:22.361
Math?!
I thought you said "meth"!

04:22.363 --> 04:24.096
Drug reference!

04:25.231 --> 04:27.199
Uh, seriously,
what am I here for?

04:27.201 --> 04:28.734
Nobody told you?

04:28.736 --> 04:30.402
They send a limo, I get in.

04:30.404 --> 04:31.737
It takes me somewhere.

04:31.739 --> 04:34.039
Then I watch the news later
to see what I did.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.441
(crowd cheers and applauds)

04:36.443 --> 04:37.542
What a nightmare.

04:37.544 --> 04:39.211
That's fair enough.
Boo-hayvin!

04:39.213 --> 04:40.579
The teams have created

04:40.581 --> 04:43.215
introductory videos
about themselves.

04:43.217 --> 04:46.451
Let's watch them,
shall we, with our eyes?

04:48.421 --> 04:50.722
NARRATOR:
<i>Springfield Elementary was</i>
<i>originally designed</i>

04:50.724 --> 04:53.725
<i>as a storage facility</i>
<i>for salt pork.</i>

04:53.727 --> 04:55.727
<i>At some later point,</i>
<i>it was turned into a school.</i>

04:55.729 --> 04:57.062
CHALMERS:
<i>Chalmskinn.</i>

04:57.064 --> 04:58.230
On hot days, pork grease

04:58.232 --> 04:59.431
still comes out of the walls.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.400
Oh, quit your whining.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.101
FRINK:
And now, Waverly Hills.

05:03.103 --> 05:06.571
Hi, I'm movie genius
Michael Bay.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.106
I used to be all like, "Math?

05:08.108 --> 05:09.608
Who needs that noise,
am I right?"

05:09.610 --> 05:11.410
But I wasn't right.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.945
The Waverly Hills math team
made me realize

05:13.947 --> 05:16.782
that quadratic equations
are hotter

05:16.784 --> 05:18.750
than a million Megan Foxes.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.186
Math on!

05:25.458 --> 05:26.958
Yo, Waverly Hills!

05:26.960 --> 05:28.460
You guys rock!

05:28.462 --> 05:29.795
Like my friend The Rock!

05:29.797 --> 05:31.296
I know his real first name!

05:31.298 --> 05:32.297
It's Dwayne!

05:32.299 --> 05:34.833
I win Hollywood!

05:39.305 --> 05:41.306
Celebrate now,
you stuck-up snobs.

05:41.308 --> 05:42.941
(cheering)

05:42.943 --> 05:46.144
But our plucky little school is
going to surprise you.

05:46.146 --> 05:48.613
We will surprise you all!

05:48.615 --> 05:50.449
(cheering)
Well, Lisa,

05:50.451 --> 05:52.117
we didn't score
a single point.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.552
That was surprising.

05:54.787 --> 05:56.321
(crying)

05:56.323 --> 05:59.491
Oh, you'll get them
next time, honey.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.793
No! No, we won't!

06:01.795 --> 06:04.463
That school is so rich!

06:04.465 --> 06:07.799
Every kid has a laptop!

06:07.801 --> 06:11.169
Her crying is sadder
than a child actor

06:11.171 --> 06:13.972
"Where are they now?" story.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.074
LISA:
It's true.

06:16.809 --> 06:18.510
As graduates of
Springfield Elementary,

06:18.512 --> 06:20.178
we want to give back.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.314
We're going to buy
every student a tablet computer

06:22.316 --> 06:24.182
and upgrade your entire school

06:24.184 --> 06:26.852
with the latest
cloud-based technology.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.187
Here's a check.
Take this check.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.655
NARRATOR:
The first black president...

06:30.657 --> 06:33.225
is decades away
from being a reality.

06:34.861 --> 06:36.828
Come back
with my fall semester!

06:36.830 --> 06:38.363
We don't need filmstrips

06:38.365 --> 06:40.198
like <i>Life in These</i>
<i>48 States</i> anymore,

06:40.200 --> 06:42.901
because our school is
going all digital!

06:42.903 --> 06:43.902
(grunts)

06:43.904 --> 06:45.504
GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE:
Ow, damn it!

06:45.506 --> 06:47.339
The teachers union
won't stand for this.

06:47.341 --> 06:48.840
It means less
work for you.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.876
I didn't know it was
possible to do less work.

06:50.878 --> 06:54.212
How intriguing.

07:33.287 --> 07:37.255
(groans)
I was the only one here
who understood osmosis.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.624
Spare me, ug-o.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.226
(groans)

07:41.228 --> 07:43.228
Willie, since all our
books have been digitized,

07:43.230 --> 07:45.564
we have no need for the
paper versions-- burn these.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.399
Wouldn't it be easier
just to toss them out?

07:47.401 --> 07:49.901
Nonsense! We now have
this state-of-the-art

07:49.903 --> 07:52.337
digital book burner.
Hmm.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.575
(laughs)
Listen to her hum.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.276
What's that?!

07:58.278 --> 07:59.578
Well, we didn't
want to leave you

07:59.580 --> 08:00.912
out of the digital
revolution.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.280
Willie, meet your
new supervisor.

08:02.282 --> 08:05.584
Aw, I have to take orders
from a machine?

08:05.586 --> 08:06.785
Oh, it can't speak.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.453
But should it ever learn, yes.

08:08.455 --> 08:11.823
("Star Spangled Banner" playing)

08:15.127 --> 08:16.461
(groans)
Will there ever be a technology

08:16.463 --> 08:17.762
that teaches stupid children

08:17.764 --> 08:21.132
how to ding a dang triangle?!

08:21.134 --> 08:24.469
This school has spent the last
50 years mired in the 1960s.

08:24.471 --> 08:27.839
Let us spend the next 50
mired in now!

08:31.777 --> 08:34.012
(singsongy):
Bo-ron!

08:34.814 --> 08:36.448
And with this ring,

08:36.450 --> 08:39.117
we unite these ancient
warring clans,

08:39.119 --> 08:41.786
who frolic unclothed,
even in winter,

08:41.788 --> 08:44.689
and bring peace to Decapita!

08:46.292 --> 08:48.693
(screams)

08:49.495 --> 08:51.296
Pay cable is awesome!

08:51.298 --> 08:53.665
Who knew they had nipples
in castle times?

08:53.667 --> 08:55.800
You're not supposed to be able
to get outside our network!

08:55.802 --> 08:58.136
You shouldn't have made
your password "password."

08:58.138 --> 08:59.671
Well, it was the name of
the street I grew up on.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.072
Password Drive!

09:03.009 --> 09:04.709
(crackling and buzzing)

09:07.346 --> 09:09.147
Seymour, you plugged
the servers in

09:09.149 --> 09:10.682
with surge protectors,
didn't you?

09:10.684 --> 09:12.150
Oh, yes, power strips.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.351
You fool.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.820
Surge protectors are
always power strips.

09:15.822 --> 09:17.222
But not vice versa!

09:24.196 --> 09:25.830
Was that us?

09:25.832 --> 09:27.032
No, sir.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.100
(chuckles)
I like it when it's not us.

09:36.375 --> 09:38.109
(clock ticking)

09:47.520 --> 09:48.520
Let's see.

09:48.522 --> 09:49.888
Roman numerals.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.222
Photosynthesis.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.358
Uh, Robert E. Lee.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.727
Miss Hoover, are you teaching
or are you just saying

09:55.729 --> 09:58.063
anything that comes
into your head?

09:58.065 --> 10:00.532
Miss Hoover, please report
to the main office.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.701
You just did that in your hand!

10:02.703 --> 10:04.569
Ralph Wiggum,
put your head down.

10:04.571 --> 10:06.871
You're the mouth-hand!

10:06.873 --> 10:08.907
All right, class.
We don't have computers

10:08.909 --> 10:10.742
and we don't have keyboards.

10:10.744 --> 10:14.379
But that doesn't mean
we can't practice our typing.

10:14.381 --> 10:15.747
Now, put your index fingers

10:15.749 --> 10:18.917
on marshmallows F and J, and...

10:18.919 --> 10:20.251
tap-tap-tap.

10:20.253 --> 10:21.586
Tap-tap-tap.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.888
Tap-tap...
Nelson, stop that!

10:23.890 --> 10:24.923
This is my dinner.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.458
I'm eating steak.

10:27.593 --> 10:29.094
Mmm! Mmm!

10:29.096 --> 10:30.795
Needs sauce.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.435
Great news, children.
I found an educational movie

10:37.437 --> 10:39.437
I can play on my phone.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.773
Crowd in--
it's kind of a little phone.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.775
NARRATOR:
Mathematics! Agriculture!

10:43.777 --> 10:45.744
Are there two
more exciting words?

10:45.746 --> 10:48.079
Since the time of the Romans,
they used scythes

10:48.081 --> 10:49.748
to kill each other.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.751
The ancient farmer needed tools
to measure his land.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.619
Ten stick knots right.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.588
Five left.

10:56.590 --> 10:57.756
Hmm.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.424
(humming a tune)

10:59.426 --> 11:00.759
(groans)

11:00.761 --> 11:03.795
Oh, come to mock
ol' Willie, have you?

11:03.797 --> 11:07.599
"Ooh, Willie has to work
in the hot sun all day.

11:07.601 --> 11:11.603
Willie's best friend is
a stick and a string."

11:11.605 --> 11:13.138
I'm not here to mock you.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.973
"Ooh, Willie doesn't know

11:14.975 --> 11:17.642
when someone's being sincere!"

11:17.644 --> 11:18.977
I'm just here to hang out.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.812
What's that device
you're using?

11:20.814 --> 11:22.947
My rummlie scob.
Nothing exciting.

11:22.949 --> 11:26.484
Just a measuring stick dating
back to the ancient druids.

11:26.486 --> 11:29.320
Oh! Could you tell me
how it works?

11:29.322 --> 11:32.457
Each knot marks the length
of a sheep's bladder.

11:32.459 --> 11:36.327
The play field is 75
stomachs by 52 kidneys.

11:36.329 --> 11:40.165
That's 163 square haggises.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.633
Move over, metric system!

11:41.635 --> 11:43.668
I'm learning
the gastric system!

11:43.670 --> 11:45.470
Clever.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.971
Uh, good news, sir,
I have assembled

11:46.973 --> 11:49.841
a page on "the piglims"
at "Rhymouth Pock."

11:49.843 --> 11:52.143
Yes, well, that's
the best we can hope for.

11:52.145 --> 11:55.013
Uh, apply
the transparent tape.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.849
Principal Skin-ner!

11:57.851 --> 12:00.485
Willie has showed me
that losing our technology

12:00.487 --> 12:03.321
doesn't have to be
the end of our learning.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.157
We can turn our school
into a Waldorf school.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.525
You mean like the hotel?

12:07.527 --> 12:09.494
Nope!
In elementary school,

12:09.496 --> 12:11.196
Waldorf education focuses

12:11.198 --> 12:13.865
on hands-on activity
and creative play.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.667
In secondary education...

12:15.669 --> 12:17.335
Ah, not our problem.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.671
After sixth grade, it's
good-bye and good luck.

12:19.673 --> 12:21.539
(both chuckling)
Yes, yes, it is.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.208
Well, it sounds good,
but I have one more question.

12:23.210 --> 12:26.044
Is it based on the book where
you find the guy in the hat?

12:26.046 --> 12:28.513
<i>Where's Waldo?</i>
<i>That's not even the name.</i>

12:28.515 --> 12:31.382
I'm surprised you guys didn't
think it was based on the salad.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.351
BOTH:
There's a Waldorf salad?

12:33.353 --> 12:34.719
(groans)

12:34.721 --> 12:37.522
Behold--
Waldorf education in action!

12:37.524 --> 12:40.692
We're getting our hands dirty
and learning by doing.

12:40.694 --> 12:43.561
So I have to make
360 sloppy joes,

12:43.563 --> 12:46.531
but I only have one pound
of hamburger meat.

12:46.533 --> 12:50.368
How many cubic feet of Styrofoam
peanuts should I add?

12:50.370 --> 12:52.203
Assuming four peanuts per joe,

12:52.205 --> 12:54.405
37 cubic feet.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.741
Well, you're
a smart little fatso.

12:56.743 --> 13:00.078
It says here that students
don't have to raise their hands.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.379
They should just
ask every question

13:01.381 --> 13:02.747
that comes to their mind.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.916
Oh. Why are pine needles pointy?

13:04.918 --> 13:06.718
And, um-um-um,
what's the difference

13:06.720 --> 13:08.720
between an asteroid
and a meteor?

13:08.722 --> 13:10.255
And, mm... ooh-ooh!

13:10.257 --> 13:12.590
Can you shrug anything
other than your shoulders?

13:12.592 --> 13:13.758
(sighs)

13:13.760 --> 13:15.593
Does anyone else have
any questions?

13:15.595 --> 13:17.896
Um, if Mommy's purse didn't
belong in the microwave,

13:17.898 --> 13:20.565
why did it fit?

13:20.567 --> 13:23.568
We won't need computers,
we won't need books.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.937
I learned not to drink
out of the crick.

13:25.939 --> 13:28.907
You mean this isn't
crick water?

13:28.909 --> 13:30.275
My daddy raised me

13:30.277 --> 13:33.778
and all my 11 dead siblings
on crick water!

13:33.780 --> 13:35.613
Huh, everyone wears a hat.

13:35.615 --> 13:38.449
Sun hats in the summer,
wool hats in the winter.

13:38.451 --> 13:39.918
Ooh, look at this.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.587
Weekly Friday night
parents' meetings.

13:42.589 --> 13:43.955
Oh... Wait.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.456
There might be a safety hatch.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.958
Does the apostrophe come before

13:46.960 --> 13:49.427
or after the "S" on "parents"?

13:49.429 --> 13:52.297
After, which means both parents.

13:52.299 --> 13:56.301
(groaning)

13:56.303 --> 13:58.102
Well, I'm not wearing a hat.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.171
People might think I'm bald.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.508

14:06.279 --> 14:08.279

and drooping trees,

14:10.450 --> 14:13.651
we greet the day
with a school song.

14:13.653 --> 14:15.620
Now I have to sing a song?!

14:15.622 --> 14:16.654
Why did those idiots mix up

14:16.656 --> 14:18.823

and surge protectors?

15:02.668 --> 15:04.502
This school is so great now.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.337
Kids learn by doing.

15:06.339 --> 15:07.872
If it's so great,
why aren't you helping

15:07.874 --> 15:09.173
your kids do their homework?

15:09.175 --> 15:11.042
Bart's here doing it
right now.

15:11.044 --> 15:13.344
No, no, no!
Not two-thirds, one-half!

15:13.346 --> 15:15.179
Now that's one-third each.

15:15.181 --> 15:18.349
Now you're learning!
(laughs)

15:18.351 --> 15:20.118
Enjoy.

15:21.553 --> 15:23.721
One earthworm...
Gah!

15:23.723 --> 15:25.056
Two halves.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.058
ALL:
Wow!

15:27.060 --> 15:28.559
Willie! Willie!

15:28.561 --> 15:30.862
They want you to coach
our school math team!

15:30.864 --> 15:34.065
I'll have to check
with my supervisor.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.366
(dings twice)

15:35.368 --> 15:36.901
Good to go!

15:36.903 --> 15:40.371
So, if Willie gets paid
three cents per square foot

15:40.373 --> 15:42.373
for seeding, and if the field

15:42.375 --> 15:45.076
is 2,500 square feet,

15:45.078 --> 15:47.078
what is Willie getting?

15:47.080 --> 15:49.380
I'd say "screwed."

15:49.382 --> 15:51.049
(groans)
You're right!

15:51.051 --> 15:53.084

16:11.438 --> 16:13.938
It was me, sir.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.774
Kids, meet your new
math team captain.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.076
It's about time.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.911
But I'm the captain.

16:19.913 --> 16:21.079
Not anymore.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.447
I can't see.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.349
I can't see.

16:29.288 --> 16:31.756
Welcome to
the long-anticipated rematch

16:31.758 --> 16:35.460
between Waverly Hills
and Springfield.

16:35.462 --> 16:37.261
(crowd cheering)

16:37.263 --> 16:39.130

16:39.132 --> 16:42.467
Um, can you tell me which
college I should go to?

16:42.469 --> 16:45.136
(stammers)
It's not a sorting hat!

16:45.138 --> 16:48.272
Please! Early applications
are due next week!

16:48.274 --> 16:50.108
All right.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.777
Uh, Miami of Ohio.

16:52.779 --> 16:55.113
(groans)
Okay.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.782
Our first question is a toss-up.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.984
"What is the least
common multiple

16:59.986 --> 17:02.787
of six, eight and 16?"

17:02.789 --> 17:04.989
48!
Is correct!

17:04.991 --> 17:06.290
(all gasp)

17:06.292 --> 17:08.459
Whoa! No one said
there'd be math!

17:08.461 --> 17:10.128
We said there'd be
nothing but math!

17:10.130 --> 17:12.663
And you're
the math team captain!

17:12.665 --> 17:14.832
I thought I wouldn't
have to do anything.

17:14.834 --> 17:17.502
You know, like an Italian
cruise ship captain.

17:17.504 --> 17:19.170
You're lucky
that captain's not here

17:19.172 --> 17:21.339
right now to answer your insult!

17:21.341 --> 17:24.142
He'd crash a ship
right into your house!

17:24.144 --> 17:25.510
Aah!

17:25.512 --> 17:28.546

And so, with the score
knotted at 29-all,

18:27.874 --> 18:31.442
it comes down
to one last question.

18:32.911 --> 18:35.413
Drawing three straight lines,

18:35.415 --> 18:37.582
construct nine non-overlapping--

18:37.584 --> 18:40.218
that's non-overlapping,
not overlapping,

19:11.618 --> 19:13.784
You guys might be richer
and better looking,

19:13.786 --> 19:17.522
but we won a contest
to even the series!

19:19.591 --> 19:21.959
Mm, that'll look great
in our trophy case.

19:21.961 --> 19:23.294
Willie, build a trophy case.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.962
Aye, sir.

19:24.964 --> 19:28.499
But you know what we should
really thank for our success?

19:29.434 --> 19:31.302
Lower standards!

19:31.304 --> 19:32.803

Lower standards!

19:32.805 --> 19:33.871
Aye.

You're wonderful, Willie.

wasn't invented for science.

19:52.158 --> 19:53.457
Really?

19:53.459 --> 19:55.126
Then what for?

19:55.128 --> 19:58.129
Oh, it was used for

The wee knots kept

to know these things.
