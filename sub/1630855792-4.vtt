- No problem.
- You earned it!

08:20.834 --> 08:24.794
- Thank you for freeing me,
hippocampus and tyrannis.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.588
- Ah!

08:26.632 --> 08:29.508
- Stop stinging yourself.
Why you stinging yourself?

08:29.593 --> 08:31.927
- I've answered your question
several times.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.678
I'm not stinging myself.

08:33.764 --> 08:35.055
- Beat it, guys.

08:35.098 --> 08:36.973
[all grumble]
- ok, whatever.

08:37.059 --> 08:38.099
- How's it going?

08:38.227 --> 08:39.976
- It's not a place
I'd choose to be.

08:40.062 --> 08:41.478
- Why are you even still here?

08:41.522 --> 08:43.813
- Well, I can't tell your
mother I just left you here.

08:43.899 --> 08:45.273
- Why not?
You're not my dad.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.192
And I don't have to
explain myself to you.

08:47.277 --> 08:50.070
You'd never get it.
You're a two-eyes.

08:50.155 --> 08:52.489
<i> - Hey, moron, you coming?</i>

08:52.533 --> 08:55.951
- [grunts] you're not
the boss of me, jagoff!

08:55.994 --> 08:57.744
We're going to the beach
to throw rocks at

08:57.788 --> 08:58.995
The island of the giants.

08:59.081 --> 09:01.039
- Does he not know that
that's impossible?

09:01.083 --> 09:02.290
Oh, they don't have
depth perception.

09:02.334 --> 09:04.000
- Ugh, bye!

09:05.587 --> 09:07.963
- [grunts]

09:10.300 --> 09:12.926
Ah, I've never been able
to hit those jagoffs

09:13.011 --> 09:14.344
But I like trying.

09:14.388 --> 09:17.889
Giants are just
extra-eyed cyclops!

09:17.975 --> 09:20.183
- [grunts]

09:20.269 --> 09:21.977
[loud impact]
- holy crap.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.436
I think you hit a giant!

09:23.480 --> 09:26.648
It might have been a baby,
but still, a giant baby.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.650
- I did! I did it!

09:30.112 --> 09:32.112
- Ah, so, look.

09:32.197 --> 09:34.197
You know, it's been fun, but--

09:34.283 --> 09:36.074
- But it gets funner?

09:36.159 --> 09:38.076
- Don't make this hard
on yourself.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.452
You're huge
and you're a badass,

09:39.496 --> 09:42.122
But deep down, you're like,
"I want my daddy!"

09:42.165 --> 09:44.291
That's not the cyclops way.

09:44.334 --> 09:47.002
We're not, like,
masking intimacy with violence.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.920
We're truly violent.

09:48.964 --> 09:51.214
- Gee, I'm not sure
I can understand!

09:51.300 --> 09:52.841
- [grunts]
- how's that?

09:52.926 --> 09:55.343
- [laughs, spits]

09:55.387 --> 09:58.930
You know, it's better than
trying to hug me,

09:59.016 --> 10:01.349
But I can still tell
you want to hug me.

10:01.435 --> 10:04.185
- How about I hug your skull
with a rock?

10:04.271 --> 10:06.563
- I guess I'd die
being proven wrong.

10:06.648 --> 10:09.566
But if I'm right,
you could never kill me.

10:09.610 --> 10:13.028
I mean, look, you got one eye,
but you're kind of a giant.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.572
- [grunts]
- see? That alone right there,

10:15.657 --> 10:18.992
That should've got me killed.
Good luck out there, ya mook.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.077
- I bet the last time
you were free,

10:21.163 --> 10:22.621
Mortals still lived in caves.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.956
- And now you make your own
tiny personal caves.

10:25.042 --> 10:26.166
Not how I would've done it.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.752
But, uh, ooh,
what are those round things?

10:28.795 --> 10:30.086
- Wheels.
- Cute.

10:30.172 --> 10:31.796
Ooh, hey, look at this.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.173
Ah? Huh?

10:33.216 --> 10:35.175
You're welcome.
[chuckles]

10:35.260 --> 10:37.052
Uh, turned out pretty useful.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.970
- We use it every day.

10:39.056 --> 10:40.972
So, uh, as discussed,

10:41.058 --> 10:43.308
My mum kind of tried to
high road us about

10:43.393 --> 10:44.934
Being supportive fans
of yours, and--

10:45.020 --> 10:46.978
- Oh, yeah, of course.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.522
Let's blow a bitch's mind.
Where's she at?

10:50.901 --> 10:52.984
- Ok, loosen up.
Don't overthink it.

10:53.070 --> 10:55.195
Random animal!

10:55.238 --> 10:57.197
Oh, that's rubbish.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.948
That's not random.
It's an ostrich.

10:59.034 --> 11:00.075
You're trying too hard.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.201
Random animal,
for real this time.

11:01.286 --> 11:02.619
Don't think, just go.

11:03.872 --> 11:06.915
Ugh, damn it.

11:06.958 --> 11:07.916
Prometheus?

11:07.959 --> 11:09.334
- Deliria?

11:10.045 --> 11:11.670
You haven't changed.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.546
- I'm immortal.

11:13.590 --> 11:14.798
- So am I.

11:25.060 --> 11:27.811

11:27.929 --> 11:29.562
- Pretty well.
- [moans]

11:33.276 --> 11:35.694
- Should we leave and
come back louder?

11:35.779 --> 11:38.312
- Ok, ok. I'm married now.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.031
- Your husband would
understand.

11:40.075 --> 11:41.324
- Oh, he'd more than
understand.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.201
He'd want to watch
and then it's a whole thing.

11:43.286 --> 11:45.286
How are you free?
- We freed him.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.372
How do you two know each other?

11:47.457 --> 11:48.540
- Well, we walked in
on that answer.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.291
I mean, they clearly
at one point banged.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.419
- Your mother was my hero.

11:52.504 --> 11:53.378
- Stop.

11:53.463 --> 11:55.880
- It was her idea
to steal fire!

11:55.924 --> 11:57.465
Both: Stop!
- Whatever.

11:57.551 --> 12:01.010
All the gods had that idea.
The idea was to piss zeus off.

12:01.096 --> 12:02.512
What happens when
he tries to find you?

12:02.597 --> 12:06.224
- I don't know. Maybe I'll have
to find him first.

12:06.268 --> 12:08.268
- So cool.
- Badass!

12:08.353 --> 12:10.478
- Hippocampus, I'd like to see
your workshop.

12:10.564 --> 12:13.940
- Holy!
Uh, yeah, it's right this way.

12:14.025 --> 12:15.400
It's a little messy right now

12:15.485 --> 12:17.068
'cause I've been
working with bronze,

12:17.154 --> 12:18.319
Which you'll probably think
is dumb,

12:18.363 --> 12:20.196
But I think
it's the fire of metals.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.448
- Why would you keep this
a secret?

12:21.491 --> 12:22.449
You brag about breathing.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.367
- I don't have to breathe.
- See?

12:24.453 --> 12:26.578
You wanted me to admire
my hero less.

12:26.621 --> 12:29.414
Telling me you nailed him is
exactly your kind of move,

12:29.499 --> 12:31.124
And by the way,
would've worked.

12:31.168 --> 12:34.794
So why is this your first
experiment with modesty?

12:34.838 --> 12:35.962
Did you love him?

12:36.006 --> 12:37.172
- A lot of gods loved him.

12:37.299 --> 12:39.048
We loved him because
he antagonized zeus,

12:39.092 --> 12:41.426
And that was always fun.
Until it wasn't.

12:41.470 --> 12:44.846
- Until he got punished
and you all fell in line.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.055
- You're out of line.

12:46.141 --> 12:48.266
You'll regret freeing him.
He's dangerous.

12:48.351 --> 12:51.311
- You never mentioned it
because you're ashamed.

12:51.313 --> 12:53.772
- Ugh, if I admit that,
will you get him to go away?

12:53.857 --> 12:54.939
- I'm your son, mum.

12:54.983 --> 12:56.566
But first,
you have to admit it.

12:56.651 --> 12:58.276
- I'm ashamed
I turned my back on him.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.195
- You should be.
Gotcha! Ha!

13:00.230 --> 13:02.280
You tried to make me feel bad
but I proved I was good!

13:02.324 --> 13:04.032
And now, you have to admit
you're bad

13:04.075 --> 13:06.075
Because I'm better than you.

13:06.161 --> 13:08.077
[in low voice]
and you admitted it.

13:08.163 --> 13:10.079
[normally] I said,
I'm better than you. Ha!

13:10.165 --> 13:11.664
- Leave my temple!

- Gladly. Dancing out.

13:13.168 --> 13:14.584

walk across

13:26.848 --> 13:28.181
The bottom of the ocean?

13:28.266 --> 13:31.100
- I was ready to go home and
I don't know how to swim.

13:31.186 --> 13:32.310
- I think that's called
drowning.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.354
- Call it what you want.
It got me home.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.648
- No, it didn't.
We're still on cyclopia.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.943
If you needed a ride home, I--
- I don't need anything!

13:40.028 --> 13:41.277
But since you're still
hovering,

13:41.363 --> 13:42.403
You might as well
give me a ride.

13:42.447 --> 13:43.863
- You wanna tell me
what happened?

13:43.949 --> 13:45.031
Did you get your feelings hurt?

13:45.033 --> 13:46.950
- If you ever
ask me that again,

13:46.993 --> 13:48.576
I'm gonna pull out
your intestines

13:48.662 --> 13:51.538
And wrap 'em around your throat
until your eyes pop out.

13:51.623 --> 13:54.207
And then I'm gonna put
your eyes up your butt,

13:54.292 --> 13:55.834
And there's gonna be
plenty of room--

13:55.919 --> 13:57.335
- Because I won't have
intestines

13:57.379 --> 13:59.379
And because eyeballs
are small, yeah.

13:59.464 --> 14:01.965
You rest here.
I'm gonna get you some water.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.175

And your daughter's...Ride.

14:12.102 --> 14:13.309

your kids" lecture,

14:15.313 --> 14:16.729
I've heard it.
- So have I.

14:16.773 --> 14:17.856
We're both monsters.

14:17.941 --> 14:20.024
We spread our seed
far and wide.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.442
Monsters are going extinct

14:21.570 --> 14:24.028
So we need to get that stuff
everywhere.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.030
I couldn't tell you
half my children's names,

14:26.032 --> 14:28.074
But that daughter of yours
gives so much

14:28.159 --> 14:29.492
And needs so little.

14:29.578 --> 14:30.577
The dream of one punch

14:30.704 --> 14:33.204
Got her through
20 years of baby pigs.

14:33.331 --> 14:34.497
- I don't know what that means,

14:34.583 --> 14:37.041
But like I told her,
cyclops don't do this.

14:37.127 --> 14:39.586
- But she's not a cyclops
because it turns out

14:39.629 --> 14:41.754
Your wiener can try
all kinds of new things.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.423
Maybe your heart could follow.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.633
- Maybe you should make
my heart follow my wiener.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.760
- Look, I'm not good at
this fighting business.

14:47.846 --> 14:49.262
- Oh, what a surprise.

14:49.347 --> 14:51.514
Guess you'll just have to
stand there and get your ass...

14:51.600 --> 14:53.308
- [grunts]
- [choking] kicked.

14:53.351 --> 14:56.185
- I tried to tell you,
I'm really bad at this.

14:56.229 --> 14:59.022
Are you alive?
Just get rid of this.

14:59.107 --> 15:02.317
Oh.
Uh, yeah, ok, that's--

15:02.360 --> 15:04.527
I was told to stay out of this.

15:04.613 --> 15:05.820
This is on me.

15:18.668 --> 15:19.751

15:19.794 --> 15:20.835

15:21.046 --> 15:22.879
- That's sharper than
anyone else could ever--

15:22.964 --> 15:24.547
- Hey, hippocampus, look at me.

15:24.633 --> 15:27.300
You know whose job it is
to be like anyone else?

15:27.385 --> 15:28.885
Everyone else.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.428
I need you to be better.
- Got it.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.013
- I thought you'd be in
the workshop.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.723
- Prometheus had me melt
his chains down

15:33.767 --> 15:35.934
So we could forge things with
their supernatural metal.

15:35.977 --> 15:37.310
- What kind of things?

15:37.395 --> 15:40.647
- Uh, just a blade that can
cut a god's throat.

15:40.774 --> 15:41.981
- Oh, hey!

15:42.067 --> 15:43.942
I shouldn't hold that
as a politician.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.151
- Are you still here?

15:45.195 --> 15:48.112
Sharper!
- Yep, right.

15:48.156 --> 15:50.657

- [quietly] oh, good.

15:50.742 --> 15:51.908
- Have fun!

15:51.952 --> 15:54.369
- There's no politics
to revolution.

15:54.496 --> 15:56.120
You're a warrior now.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.706
Tomorrow,
we lay siege to olympus.

15:58.792 --> 16:01.918
- That doesn't sound like me.
Never been a siege-layer.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.711
My big move is sarcasm.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.547
Like, if I really hate someone
and they do something stupid,

16:06.591 --> 16:10.677
I'll say, "good one,"
but they know I don't mean it.

16:10.762 --> 16:12.512
- I gave you people fire

16:12.597 --> 16:15.765
To get things done,
to set things right!

16:15.850 --> 16:18.643
I come back and you've invented
something called pie?

16:18.728 --> 16:21.729
- Those are the words of a man
that has never tried pie.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.106
- Put him down.

16:23.191 --> 16:25.608
- And what if I don't?
Don't tell me you'll actually

16:25.652 --> 16:27.986
Fight for something
you care about.

16:28.029 --> 16:29.904
- I don't care about him.
Look at his hair!

16:29.990 --> 16:32.365
I'm just saying the mortals
can't help you fight zeus.

16:32.450 --> 16:34.283
Mortals die.
They're famous for it.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.785
It's right there in the name.

16:35.829 --> 16:36.953
[thud]

16:37.038 --> 16:38.913
- What god would
I ever trust again?

16:38.957 --> 16:40.665
- Me.

16:40.709 --> 16:41.958
- Really?

16:43.128 --> 16:44.877
Ok! Good to hear.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.046
We leave at dawn.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.381
- What are we gonna do
about this guy?

16:48.466 --> 16:51.050
- I'll do as he says.
I owe him that much.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.510
- You'll end up on
a rock with him!

16:52.595 --> 16:54.804
And you can't possibly have
any liver to spare.

16:54.931 --> 16:57.807
- If he fails, which he will,
that's what he does,

16:57.892 --> 16:59.100
Zeus is going to know

16:59.185 --> 17:01.060
Who freed, sheltered,
and armed him,

17:01.146 --> 17:03.312
And your entire city
will be a hole

17:03.398 --> 17:05.732
The shape of
a giant zeus penis.

17:05.817 --> 17:08.943
- So you're doing this
to protect me?

17:08.987 --> 17:10.778
- How's that feel?

17:10.822 --> 17:13.031
- Bad.
- Good. You deserve it.

17:13.074 --> 17:15.533
[slurps, sighs]

17:17.328 --> 17:19.037
- [as donny]
hey, stupendous!

17:19.080 --> 17:20.288
I heard you're leaving

17:20.331 --> 17:22.790
And I wanted to say I'm sorry

17:22.834 --> 17:24.751
And I love you very much.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.919
- Shlub, did you kill my dad?

17:27.047 --> 17:30.548
- Uh...Yes.

17:31.342 --> 17:33.217
- Thank you.
You didn't have to do that.

17:33.261 --> 17:35.803
- It really wasn't my goal.
I just wanted him to stop--

17:35.930 --> 17:37.055
Look, you came a long way.

17:37.140 --> 17:38.890
I didn't want your trip
to be a waste.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.808
- It wasn't. I found a dad.

17:40.894 --> 17:45.021
- Yeah?
Oh! Aw, that's sweet.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.064
We should get going.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.065
Now I come to think about it,

17:47.108 --> 17:48.983
I killed a lot of these chaps.

17:50.779 --> 17:54.405
- [grunting]

17:54.491 --> 17:55.865
- Practicing for
your big mission?

17:55.909 --> 17:57.283
- What do you care?

17:57.368 --> 18:00.036
Can't believe I got chained
to a rock for you people.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.038
- I can't believe
I unchained you

18:02.082 --> 18:03.831
Just to feel superior to
my mother.

18:03.917 --> 18:04.916
- You sure blew that one.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.167
- Yeah, turns out she'll go

18:06.211 --> 18:07.960
Way further than me
to feel superior.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.212
- You really can't fathom

18:09.297 --> 18:11.839
The idea of genuine sacrifice,
can you?

18:11.925 --> 18:14.467
- Can you?
- Excuse me?

18:14.552 --> 18:17.303
- I mean, sacrifice is when
you don't care about yourself.

18:17.347 --> 18:18.971
And I haven't
known you too long,

18:19.057 --> 18:21.057
But wow, it's just
all about you,

18:21.142 --> 18:23.684
Which I think is actually
what made you my hero.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.061
- What is this?

18:25.063 --> 18:26.187
<i> - Recognize it?</i>

18:26.272 --> 18:27.939
I'm pretty sure
it's sharp enough now

18:28.024 --> 18:29.941
But I'd love a reason
to test it.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.692
- I'm calling it insurance,

18:31.778 --> 18:33.069
Something I'll be giving to
mortals

18:33.113 --> 18:34.529
With no strings attached.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.698
- You're gonna kill me to
prove yourself to your mommy?

18:37.784 --> 18:40.618
- It's more like I'd rather die
than owe her my life,

18:40.662 --> 18:42.120
Since I'd never hear
the end of it.

18:42.205 --> 18:44.330
- You're all so selfish!

18:44.374 --> 18:47.083
And the mortals are no better
than the gods.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.460
- Kind of makes you want to
stop helping,

18:49.546 --> 18:51.337
Live free for yourself.

18:51.422 --> 18:53.631
It would serve us right, right?

18:55.301 --> 18:57.051
- Let me ask you something.
That wheel thing,

18:57.095 --> 18:59.178
Is that a human invention?
- Yeah.

18:59.222 --> 19:01.347
- And so squirrels don't have
the wheel?

19:01.432 --> 19:03.307
- Squirrels don't need wheels.

19:03.393 --> 19:06.519
They wouldn't know how to--
- they wouldn't know how.

19:06.604 --> 19:10.022
Isn't that a convenient way
of looking at it?

19:10.108 --> 19:12.984
- Are you gonna steal the wheel
from man

19:13.069 --> 19:15.153
And give it to squirrels?

19:15.196 --> 19:18.948
- [chuckling] what? No.
I'd never do that.

19:19.033 --> 19:24.662

19:24.747 --> 19:26.497
So long, mortals.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.708
I hope you can live with
the shame of letting me down.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.335
- Would you like a bigger bag
for all those wheels?

19:31.421 --> 19:32.461
- [chuckling]
are these wheels?

19:32.547 --> 19:34.046
I don't know how those
got in my bag.

19:34.132 --> 19:35.464
I'll bring them back later.

19:35.592 --> 19:38.801
But first, I'd like to steal
a moment with your mother.

19:38.887 --> 19:40.303
- Yep.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.930
- Come with me. I'm gonna give
the wheel to squirrels.

19:42.974 --> 19:44.182
- We've resolved this.

19:44.267 --> 19:46.142
I never believed in
your causes.

19:46.144 --> 19:48.186
I just liked being angry.

19:48.229 --> 19:51.105
- But the sex was amazing.
- All sex with me is amazing.

19:51.191 --> 19:54.567
And whether you see it or not,
this civilization thing,

19:54.611 --> 19:56.819
It is the mortals doing
the best they can

19:56.863 --> 19:58.362
With what you gave them.

19:58.448 --> 19:59.780
You did do something good
for them

19:59.866 --> 20:01.282
And it's worth protecting.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.367
- You couldn't have planned
this speech more ironically.

20:03.453 --> 20:06.245
There's a guy collecting
pig feces over your shoulder.

20:06.331 --> 20:08.331
- They call it agriculture.
- Ok.

20:08.374 --> 20:11.417
From fire to collecting poop.

20:11.502 --> 20:12.960
You live and you learn.

20:13.046 --> 20:15.004
One last kiss?
- We had our last one.

20:15.089 --> 20:16.631
The next is for my husband.

20:16.716 --> 20:17.715
- Prometheus?

20:19.928 --> 20:21.761
- Shlub?
What are you doing here?

20:21.804 --> 20:23.471
- I live here.
- Ah.

20:23.514 --> 20:25.306
Any interest in helping lead
a revolution of squirrels?

20:25.433 --> 20:26.724
- No, not really.

20:26.935 --> 20:30.478
But if you're unchained now,
will you still want handies?

20:36.110 --> 20:38.027
- Is that hercules?

20:38.071 --> 20:39.779
- It's heracles.
