{\an8}(man)
Previously on "Love &amp; Hip-Hop:
Hollywood"...

00:05.739 --> 00:07.374
{\an7}When was the last time
you seen Amber?

00:07.440 --> 00:08.975
{\an8}Uh, the other day.

00:09.042 --> 00:10.677
{\an8}Stop (bleep) lying!

00:10.744 --> 00:14.080
{\an7}Take all your (bleep)
and get the (bleep) out.

00:14.147 --> 00:15.548
{\an8}We got matching tattoos.

00:15.615 --> 00:17.617
{\an8}He wants to be with me,
he wants to marry me.

00:17.684 --> 00:20.854
{\an8}He's not in love with you,
he's in love with me.

00:20.920 --> 00:23.423
{\an8}I'm at a point right now where I
just need to focus on, you know,

00:23.490 --> 00:24.791
{\an8}Princess Love collection.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.259
{\an8}That's why
I brought you here.

00:26.326 --> 00:27.961
{\an7}And we can just get
the ball rolling, like...

00:28.027 --> 00:29.896
{\an8}I'm ready to go.

00:29.963 --> 00:31.531
{\an7}(Teairra)
I'm getting lipo.

00:31.598 --> 00:33.166
{\an8}Our fashion show
is in two weeks.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.001
{\an8}You think you're
gonna be ready to go?

00:35.068 --> 00:37.604
{\an7}I feel like I just
let a bus run me over.

00:37.670 --> 00:38.872
{\an8}I'm just
a little worried

00:38.938 --> 00:40.774
{\an8}'cause we have so much
stuff to get done.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.642
{\an7}I don't mind taking on
that responsibility,

00:42.709 --> 00:43.843
{\an7}'cause that's
what I'm good at.

00:43.910 --> 00:45.445
{\an8}I'm with you.

00:45.512 --> 00:46.913
{\an7}You understand that
this is gonna be

00:46.980 --> 00:49.783
{\an8}a very complicated
love relationship?

00:49.849 --> 00:50.817
{\an9}I'm aware.

00:49.849 --> 00:50.817
{\an7}Okay.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.986
{\an8}All I can do is try.

00:53.052 --> 00:54.654
{\an7}Stop it--

00:53.052 --> 00:54.654
{\an8}You have never cared!

00:54.721 --> 00:56.456
{\an8}Not until yesterday
did I get a glimpse

00:56.523 --> 00:58.625
{\an7}that you did not
have a support system.

00:58.691 --> 01:00.126
{\an7}You're attacking me
and I'm the one

01:00.193 --> 01:02.796
{\an7}that's been helping,
all this time.

01:02.862 --> 01:03.863
{\an7}What about
the contract?

01:03.930 --> 01:04.897
{\an7}Did you ever get
out of the contract?

01:04.964 --> 01:06.299
{\an8}Yeah, we good.

01:06.366 --> 01:07.567
{\an8}Your boo is tripping.

01:07.634 --> 01:09.335
{\an8}What's wrong with him?

01:07.634 --> 01:09.335
{\an8}He's just pissed off

01:09.402 --> 01:10.937
{\an8}'cause he can't get
out that Harry contract.

(Rich)
It's been wearing me out,

02:05.658 --> 02:07.060
trying to fix this broken
relationship

02:07.126 --> 02:09.429
between Momo and her moms,
and this past weekend,

02:09.496 --> 02:11.931
I met with her son
for the first time,

02:11.998 --> 02:13.600
and I ain't gonna lie,
it's a lot,

02:13.666 --> 02:15.235
and I need
a (bleep) break.

02:15.301 --> 02:18.304
{\an5}(Rich)
Back in New York, I usually kick
it with my creep squad,

02:18.371 --> 02:21.007
but here in L.A.,
I kick it with the homie Ray J.

02:21.074 --> 02:23.042
He's a one-man
creep squad.

02:23.109 --> 02:25.378
What the (bleep) y'all
doing in my city, man?

02:25.445 --> 02:26.679
You know what
I'm saying?

02:26.746 --> 02:28.648
{\an8}Is all y'all moved
out here now? Like...

02:28.715 --> 02:29.983
{\an8}Yeah.

02:28.715 --> 02:29.983
{\an8}Come on, man, we--

02:30.049 --> 02:31.784
{\an1}New York, Chicago, L.A.,
come on.

02:31.851 --> 02:33.186
We turning the city up.

02:33.253 --> 02:35.889
{\an5}You know what time it is.

02:33.253 --> 02:35.889
And you, what's up?

02:35.955 --> 02:38.491
You know what I'm saying?
You NYC and to L.A. now?

02:38.558 --> 02:40.593
{\an5}Are you officially--

02:38.558 --> 02:40.593
You know, you know.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.028
Come on, this is a whole
'nother twist, though.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.063
{\an5}You know, my (bleep).

02:42.095 --> 02:44.063
You on the same--

02:44.130 --> 02:45.732
{\an5}You mentally on the same-

02:44.130 --> 02:45.732
Come on, man.

02:45.798 --> 02:46.799
You are, too,
but you married,

02:46.866 --> 02:47.834
so we gotta keep you
at a certain--

02:47.901 --> 02:49.769
{\an5}Oh, so...

02:47.901 --> 02:49.769
No, I'm saying--

02:49.836 --> 02:51.337
No, we gotta protect you,
you know what I'm saying?

02:51.404 --> 02:52.572
Protect your relationship.

02:52.639 --> 02:54.040
Oh, but you with
Moniece, though, too.

02:54.107 --> 02:55.141
I ain't having
Moniece stab me.

02:55.208 --> 02:56.175
Moniece, I'm sorry.

02:56.242 --> 02:57.377
What was I
thinking about?

02:57.443 --> 02:59.479
What am I thinking
about, man?

02:59.546 --> 03:00.747
Goddamn, I'm thinking
you out here single.

03:00.813 --> 03:02.482
{\an1}You're right,
you're right, you're right.

03:02.549 --> 03:04.017
You not out here single!

03:04.083 --> 03:06.386
I been knowing Mo for years.

03:06.452 --> 03:07.587
{\an8}She was gonna be
in this girl group

03:07.654 --> 03:09.122
{\an8}that my sister
was putting together,

03:09.188 --> 03:12.392
{\an8}and her family, well, I been
knowing them since day one,

03:12.458 --> 03:14.360
and I can tell you
this, amigo.

03:14.427 --> 03:15.528
She's a handful,

03:15.595 --> 03:17.697
and I hope Rich
know what he doing.

03:17.764 --> 03:19.532
Listen, this is what
I'm gonna tell you.

03:19.599 --> 03:20.934
{\an1}I love Mo.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.536
We doing what we do, but I'm
gonna be-- I gotta be Rich.

03:23.603 --> 03:25.004
{\an1}I hope you can handle that,
though, 'cause she--

03:25.071 --> 03:26.739
{\an5}Moniece intense.

03:25.071 --> 03:26.739
{\an1}Yeah.

03:26.806 --> 03:29.409
{\an1}It's a lot-- it's a lot
more than what I thought, Ray.

03:29.475 --> 03:30.810
I'm really trying to do
the right thing with Mo,

03:30.877 --> 03:33.079
but it's starting to feel
like a full-time job.

03:33.146 --> 03:35.381
I'm getting pulled in
deep on this one, like,

03:35.448 --> 03:37.083
I'm having an identity
crisis, man.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.952
This is not
the old Richie D.

03:39.018 --> 03:41.187
The new Richie D is trying to do
the right thing by Mo,

03:41.254 --> 03:43.756
but the old Richie D,
I'd hit the town with Ray J

03:43.823 --> 03:45.091
with a couple of
bad ones, man,

03:45.158 --> 03:47.060
and I probably wouldn't
even answer my phone.

03:47.126 --> 03:48.328
A lot of people can't
handle Moniece,

03:48.394 --> 03:49.862
you know
what I'm saying?

03:49.929 --> 03:51.731
{\an5}I know her whole family,
you know what I'm saying,

03:51.798 --> 03:53.399
{\an5}and she's strong.

03:51.798 --> 03:53.399
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

03:53.466 --> 03:55.335
Just like my
ex-girlfriend.

03:55.401 --> 03:56.536
{\an3}She crazy.

03:56.603 --> 03:58.304
Princess outta control.

03:58.371 --> 03:59.872
But I love her, though.

03:59.939 --> 04:01.808
But when they get
pushed to the limit...

04:01.874 --> 04:03.009
There ain't no telling.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.677
{\an6}Red line.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.677
{\an1}Red line.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.245
{\an1}And that's where
I'm at now, I'm like--

04:06.312 --> 04:09.082
(Bleep) the red line,
flat line.

04:09.148 --> 04:10.350
{\an5}Tell me about it.

04:09.148 --> 04:10.350
(imitates flat line tone)

04:17.223 --> 04:18.491
{\an9}Kam.

04:18.558 --> 04:20.593
{\an8}This is, like, the longest
swing of my life.

04:20.660 --> 04:22.795
{\an1}I like to tuck and roll,
that's my thing.

04:22.862 --> 04:24.263
Tuck and roll,
that's your thing?

04:24.330 --> 04:26.132
{\an1}Ever since my emotional
breakdown, or breakthrough,

04:26.199 --> 04:27.734
whatever you want
to call it, with Dreux,

04:27.800 --> 04:29.335
{\an8}things with me and him
have been a lot easier

04:29.402 --> 04:31.871
{\an8}and it's made it easier for me
to deal with him

04:31.938 --> 04:33.406
{\an8}in terms of Kamron.

04:33.473 --> 04:35.174
(Kamron laughing)

04:35.241 --> 04:36.943
{\an5}What's up, boy?

04:35.241 --> 04:36.943
What's up?

04:37.010 --> 04:38.111
{\an5}(Moniece)
Now that he understands
some of the things

04:38.177 --> 04:39.646
that I've been
dealing with,

04:39.712 --> 04:42.682
and now that he's being more
supportive, the end result--

04:42.749 --> 04:44.684
I've been spending more time
with my muffin,

04:44.751 --> 04:46.119
and it's been
really nice.

04:46.185 --> 04:48.855
I wanted to start off
by saying thank you.

04:48.921 --> 04:50.723
and I appreciate you,

04:50.790 --> 04:52.191
{\an1}you know, stepping up,
being here more,

04:52.258 --> 04:53.192
'cause I'm starting
to see a difference

04:53.259 --> 04:55.662
{\an1}in y'all relationship,
you know,

04:55.728 --> 04:57.296
so in saying that,

04:57.363 --> 04:59.565
{\an1}I want us to try to come up
with a little something

04:59.632 --> 05:01.834
{\an1}more consistent
for the both of us.

05:01.901 --> 05:03.503
{\an5}Okay.

05:01.901 --> 05:03.503
More so for Kamron.

05:03.569 --> 05:06.072
So let's just go back
to week on, week off.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.174
{\an1}But I also want us
to honor this.

05:08.241 --> 05:10.643
All right, baby daddy,
I got you.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.612
And I really appreciate
this talk, and...

05:12.679 --> 05:15.214
{\an1}Also, I have something
else I wanted to ask you,

05:15.281 --> 05:17.083
{\an1}'cause I know this weekend,
you had briefly mentioned

05:17.150 --> 05:20.553
{\an1}that you were picking up
your boyfriend, and Kamron,

05:20.620 --> 05:23.256
{\an1}you know, was with you, so
I wanted to know how serious

05:23.322 --> 05:24.590
{\an1}that was because,
you know,

05:24.657 --> 05:27.894
somebody's gonna
be around my son.

05:27.960 --> 05:28.995
I need to know.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.697
Well, it's definitely
serious.

05:30.763 --> 05:31.764
{\an1}Like, really,
you're not just dating,

05:31.831 --> 05:33.299
{\an1}y'all are in an actual
relationship?

05:33.366 --> 05:36.002
Well, technically, I'm not
locked in 'til I'm married,

05:36.069 --> 05:38.771
but yes, I am committed
to the relationship

05:38.838 --> 05:42.842
{\an1}and inevitably gonna have
to integrate he and Kamron.

05:42.909 --> 05:45.978
I'm glad that Moniece is finally
in a happy relationship,

05:46.045 --> 05:49.082
but my son is still very young
and very impressionable.

05:49.148 --> 05:50.583
{\an8}I don't know
Rich personally,

05:50.650 --> 05:52.685
{\an8}but it's a lot out there
about this guy,

05:52.752 --> 05:55.288
{\an8}so I need
to see for myself.

05:55.354 --> 05:57.457
{\an1}I have heard what I heard
in the media about him,

05:57.523 --> 05:59.992
{\an1}and I don't like to pass
judgment on anybody.

06:00.059 --> 06:01.928
{\an5}Right.

06:00.059 --> 06:01.928
But when it comes to Kamron

06:01.994 --> 06:03.229
and his safety
and security,

06:03.296 --> 06:04.597
{\an1}I need to know
what's going on.

06:04.664 --> 06:06.065
And I absolutely feel
like you should be able

06:06.132 --> 06:10.903
{\an1}to put a face to the person
that I eventually intend

06:10.970 --> 06:12.672
to blend families with.

06:12.739 --> 06:14.440
{\an1}Well, if somebody's
gonna be in my son's life

06:14.507 --> 06:15.775
and be an influence,

06:15.842 --> 06:17.744
{\an1}I definitely need to sit down
with him face to face.

06:17.810 --> 06:19.512
Dreux definitely has
the right to meet Rich

06:19.579 --> 06:21.414
if Rich is gonna be
around Kamron.

06:21.481 --> 06:23.182
I just don't know how
Rich is gonna feel about

06:23.249 --> 06:25.184
sitting down with
my baby daddy.

06:25.251 --> 06:28.421
All our sit-downs so far
haven't really gone so well,

06:28.488 --> 06:30.456
but if he's serious about
being with me,

06:30.523 --> 06:31.724
then sitting down with
Dreux is just something

06:31.791 --> 06:33.459
he's gonna have to do.

06:33.526 --> 06:37.830
{\an1}So, I'll talk to Rich and
I'll try to set something up.

06:37.897 --> 06:38.931
Well, let me know
when it's set up.

06:38.998 --> 06:40.199
{\an1}All right.

06:40.266 --> 06:42.135
Let's get this boy some
ice cream or something.

06:46.906 --> 06:48.341
{\an8}(Miles)
Coming out to my family
and Amber

06:48.407 --> 06:50.543
{\an8}was probably the hardest thing
that I've ever done.

06:50.610 --> 06:53.146
{\an8}But I feel like a brick wall
has been finally relieved

06:53.212 --> 06:54.814
{\an8}off of my chest
and off of my back,

06:54.881 --> 06:57.350
{\an8}and I'm just living
in my truth.

06:57.416 --> 06:59.418
Now there's only
one thing missing.

06:59.485 --> 07:01.988
I haven't seen Milan since he
kicked me out the apartment.

07:02.054 --> 07:04.290
And honestly,
I'm just trying to do

07:04.357 --> 07:05.558
whatever I can do
to get him back.

07:07.226 --> 07:08.928
Oh, this is--
this is cute.

07:08.995 --> 07:09.929
You know, I've been
calling Milan,

07:09.996 --> 07:11.330
I've been texting him,

07:11.397 --> 07:13.699
I've been hitting him up
and he's been ignoring me,

07:13.766 --> 07:15.001
but I've done everything,
pretty much,

07:15.067 --> 07:16.169
that he's
wanted me to do.

07:16.235 --> 07:18.171
My family know,
Amber know,

07:18.237 --> 07:20.973
and hopefully, he sees
that I did this for him.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.475
(bleep), for us.

07:22.542 --> 07:23.843
On the first and foremost,

07:23.910 --> 07:25.912
thank you for coming
to sit down with me today.

07:25.978 --> 07:27.180
I just want to apologize
for everything,

07:27.246 --> 07:30.850
I know the last
time I seen you,

07:30.917 --> 07:33.419
you was following me
to Amber's house.

07:33.486 --> 07:34.821
I know you
saw me park.

07:34.887 --> 07:36.289
I did not go in.

07:36.355 --> 07:38.624
{\an1}So you expect me to believe
that you-- you parked the car--

07:38.691 --> 07:40.026
Milan, I'm not
lying to you, man.

07:40.092 --> 07:41.360
Like, you don't understand
how hard this (bleep)

07:41.427 --> 07:43.229
{\an1}has been for me,
like, this (bleep) is hard.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.797
{\an1}I want to be
a part of that.

07:44.864 --> 07:46.666
{\an1}You can't just shut me out
and we're in a relationship.

07:46.732 --> 07:48.467
{\an1}Like, when I'm calling
you and texting you,

07:48.534 --> 07:49.602
{\an1}it's because
I'm concerned,

07:49.669 --> 07:51.037
{\an1}so I want to know where my
(bleep) is at.

07:51.103 --> 07:52.405
{\an1}Look, look, look--
I'm not here to argue with you.

07:52.471 --> 07:54.273
I'm here to apologize
and say you're right.

07:54.340 --> 07:55.675
I should have told you
where I was going.

07:55.741 --> 07:57.143
I should have
let you know up front

07:57.210 --> 07:58.644
what was going on
that night,

07:58.711 --> 07:59.779
I should have told you.

07:59.846 --> 08:00.980
(Milan)
I'm glad Miles apologized to me

08:01.047 --> 08:02.348
about the way things
went down,

08:02.415 --> 08:04.183
{\an8}and you know,
talking to Amber at the studio,

08:04.250 --> 08:05.852
{\an8}it proved to me that
it couldn't be easier

08:05.918 --> 08:06.953
{\an8}to tell her
in the first place.

08:07.019 --> 08:08.254
So you told Amber, huh?

08:08.321 --> 08:09.956
{\an3}I told her.

08:10.022 --> 08:13.159
{\an1}I set up a counselor,
I went and sat down with her,

08:13.226 --> 08:15.094
I came out to her
and told her.

08:15.161 --> 08:18.464
{\an1}You don't think that I should
have been a part of that?

08:18.531 --> 08:20.099
{\an1}Of you-- at least knowing
you gonna tell her?

08:20.166 --> 08:21.534
Like, that's dope,
I'm proud of you.

08:21.601 --> 08:23.936
You know, she threatened
to tell my entire family.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.504
So what did I do?

08:25.571 --> 08:27.840
{\an1}The only person I could run to
to talk about the situation,

08:27.907 --> 08:30.776
{\an1}I blow you up, you ignore me,
so now I'm all by myself.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.111
(bleep) I didn't
answer your phone

08:32.178 --> 08:33.379
{\an1}'cause you didn't
answer my phone calls.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.114
If I would have known
what you were doing,

08:35.181 --> 08:37.250
{\an1}I would have been there for you,
like I'm always there for you.

08:37.316 --> 08:38.717
You getting offensive,
you getting mad.

08:38.784 --> 08:40.019
{\an1}Because you saying it in a
defensive-- in a defensive way.

08:40.086 --> 08:40.986
All I'm doing is
telling you what happened.

08:41.053 --> 08:42.355
You're taking it that way.

08:42.421 --> 08:45.124
{\an1}I'm just letting you know,
I told her, she flipped out.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.893
The only thing I could do
was go tell my family

08:46.959 --> 08:48.561
before she
told my family.

08:48.628 --> 08:50.963
I had to sit down with my
sisters, tell my sisters

08:51.030 --> 08:52.665
everything that's going on.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.500
Like, how did it end?

08:54.567 --> 08:58.304
{\an1}At the end of the day,
it ended with us all crying.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.872
{\an3}Um...

08:59.939 --> 09:02.508
{\an1}They said they loved me and
they'll always love me.

09:02.575 --> 09:03.509
But I'm gonna be honest.

09:03.576 --> 09:04.944
{\an3}They, uh...

09:05.011 --> 09:07.580
They want to meet you.

09:07.647 --> 09:10.116
I can't believe Miles wants me
to meet his family.

09:10.182 --> 09:12.618
That's a big step
for him, and for us.

09:12.685 --> 09:13.953
It shows me he's ready to claim
me in front of everyone,

09:14.020 --> 09:15.721
and that's something
I've been asking for

09:15.788 --> 09:17.490
for a very long time,
and at this point,

09:17.556 --> 09:20.026
I honestly
couldn't be any happier.

09:20.092 --> 09:21.360
{\an1}I'm down.

09:21.427 --> 09:22.895
{\an5}It's time to meet the family.

09:21.427 --> 09:22.895
I'm on the way.

09:22.962 --> 09:24.063
{\an5}Let them soak everything.

09:22.962 --> 09:24.063
{\an1}Yeah.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.631
Let 'em soak it.

09:25.698 --> 09:29.168
Miles is dealing with
somebody, it's a man.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.304
Let them marinate on that.

09:31.370 --> 09:33.439
{\an1}I got that,
I can deal with that.

09:33.506 --> 09:37.843
{\an1}I appreciate everything
that you've done,

09:37.910 --> 09:39.278
{\an1}but at the end
of the day, I really--

09:39.345 --> 09:41.447
{\an1}I'm really glad that
you did it, because you--

09:41.514 --> 09:43.950
{\an1}you really did it for yourself,
you know what I mean?

09:44.016 --> 09:47.353
Like, in order to grow

09:47.420 --> 09:48.821
{\an1}and in order to be
a better person,

09:48.888 --> 09:51.123
you gotta be comfortable, you
gotta be true to who you are.

09:51.190 --> 09:52.992
{\an1}Thank you for always supporting
me and having my back,

09:53.059 --> 09:55.561
even through
all my (bleep)-ups,

09:55.628 --> 09:57.296
the way I try to put
(bleep) together,

09:57.363 --> 09:58.898
this (bleep) is
just hard, man, like,

09:58.965 --> 10:00.866
{\an1}it's the hardest (bleep) that
I've ever been through,

10:00.933 --> 10:04.170
{\an1}but I feel like I'm,
like, the happiest that

10:04.236 --> 10:05.304
I've ever been right now.

10:05.371 --> 10:07.206
{\an5}Who are you happy with, though?

10:05.371 --> 10:07.206
{\an3}You.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.208
{\an5}Who you love?

10:07.273 --> 10:09.208
You, (bleep).

10:09.275 --> 10:10.643
For life, right?

10:10.710 --> 10:12.311
{\an5}For life.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.311
{\an1}All right.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.214
Can I get a kiss?

10:16.615 --> 10:17.616
I love you.

10:17.683 --> 10:18.751
I love you, too.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.522
Coming out to friends and family

10:23.589 --> 10:24.757
can be a challenging process.

10:24.824 --> 10:25.958
I've been there.

10:26.025 --> 10:27.226
Don't lose hope.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.561
{\an8}There are resources
that can help.

10:28.627 --> 10:32.365
{\an8}Please go to OutInHipHop.VH1.com
for support.

10:33.899 --> 10:36.102
{\an7}Ain't that my boy
Willie's wife?

10:36.168 --> 10:37.136
{\an8}Shanda?

10:37.203 --> 10:38.270
{\an8}Yeah, she been
working with us.

10:38.337 --> 10:40.806
{\an8}Yo, stop playing.

10:38.337 --> 10:40.806
{\an8}She just started.

10:40.873 --> 10:44.543
{\an8}Talked to Dreux and
he wants to meet you.

10:44.610 --> 10:46.178
{\an7}Now I'm starting
to feel a way.

10:46.245 --> 10:48.347
{\an7}Like, I'm not out here
to be interrogated.

10:48.414 --> 10:49.615
{\an7}I (bleep)
was your friend.

10:49.682 --> 10:50.983
{\an8}Since when were
you my friend?

10:51.050 --> 10:52.685
{\an7}When you were (bleep) Berg's
(bleep) in the alley?

10:52.752 --> 10:55.021
{\an7}I hope you mother(bleep)
die tomorrow.

11:01.794 --> 11:03.596
♪♪

11:13.072 --> 11:15.574
{\an5}(Fizz)
So now that Moniece is carrying
most of her weight with Kam,

11:15.641 --> 11:18.377
it gives me a little bit more
time to focus on my music

11:18.444 --> 11:20.679
and my girl,
Miss Nikki Baby.

11:24.116 --> 11:25.117
What are you
doing over here?

11:25.184 --> 11:26.619
Max Lux and I came up

11:26.685 --> 11:28.888
with this dope new record
called "Good Lotion,"

11:28.954 --> 11:32.258
and I've been playing around
with some video treatment ideas

11:32.324 --> 11:35.094
and I was talking to Nikki
about starring in it.

11:35.161 --> 11:37.863
{\an8}I got a vision of rubbing that
lotion, that good lotion,

11:37.930 --> 11:41.333
{\an8}all over that voluptuous...

11:41.400 --> 11:44.236
{\an8}You know.

11:44.303 --> 11:45.271
{\an1}What's up
with you, though?

11:45.337 --> 11:46.572
{\an1}How the fashion show
coming along?

11:46.639 --> 11:47.740
It's going good,
you know.

11:47.807 --> 11:48.841
I'm just a little
bit concerned

11:48.908 --> 11:51.010
because T.T. dropped
this bomb on me

11:51.077 --> 11:52.478
that she's having
lipo done on her body.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.013
{\an1}Lipo?

11:54.080 --> 11:56.315
I'm just concerned because,
you know, we have this date

11:56.382 --> 12:00.119
{\an1}and we're not pushing it back
and it's not gonna be a failure.

12:00.186 --> 12:01.787
{\an8}I think it was
a little selfish of T.T.

12:01.854 --> 12:03.322
{\an8}to go ahead with her lipo,

12:03.389 --> 12:05.391
{\an8}knowing how close we are
to the show.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.126
I'm just glad that Hazel's
stepping in

12:07.193 --> 12:08.761
and helping me
take control of this event,

12:08.828 --> 12:10.396
even if, like Hazel said,

12:10.463 --> 12:12.098
we have to bring in other
designers like Princess

12:12.164 --> 12:13.933
to make sure
there is a show.

12:13.999 --> 12:15.668
{\an1}I don't want to fail and I know
people are expecting me

12:15.734 --> 12:16.769
to come with something big.

12:16.836 --> 12:19.071
{\an1}I understand, like...
Trust me.

12:19.138 --> 12:21.640
I'm under a lot of pressure,
too, of getting stuff done.

12:21.707 --> 12:23.309
{\an1}You know I got
the "Lotion" about to drop.

12:23.375 --> 12:24.844
Shooting a video for it.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.246
{\an5}You ready for it?

12:24.910 --> 12:27.246
{\an3}No.

12:27.313 --> 12:28.447
{\an4}No?

12:27.313 --> 12:28.447
{\an3}No.

12:28.514 --> 12:29.448
What you mean, no?

12:29.515 --> 12:30.883
Honestly,
I have to be honest.

12:30.950 --> 12:32.551
I don't think I'm gonna
be able to do your video,

12:32.618 --> 12:35.955
because I have
a lot on my plate.

12:36.021 --> 12:37.756
You know, Nikki's
like that inspiration

12:37.823 --> 12:40.860
that put the lotion in
"Good Lotion," you feel me?

12:40.926 --> 12:43.295
Now she's gonna
leave me out to dry?

12:43.362 --> 12:47.733
{\an1}But I built this vision kinda
around you, you feel me?

12:47.800 --> 12:49.301
I know, well,
you can find someone else

12:49.368 --> 12:51.103
to build the vision
around them.

12:53.272 --> 12:56.642
{\an1}Ain't that-- ain't that
my boy Willie's wife?

12:56.709 --> 12:58.043
{\an3}Oh.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.044
{\an3}Shanda?

12:59.111 --> 13:00.079
Yeah, she's been
working with us.

13:00.146 --> 13:01.313
She been doing part time.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.349
{\an5}Yo, stop playing.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.349
She just started.

13:03.415 --> 13:05.818
It's my boy Willie's wife,
Shanda, on stage,

13:05.885 --> 13:08.554
like, I'm just, like,
in complete awe, like...

13:08.621 --> 13:09.822
I didn't even want to look,

13:09.889 --> 13:12.424
like, it was, like,
whoa, who is that?

13:13.826 --> 13:16.295
{\an5}I feel bad.

13:13.826 --> 13:16.295
Well, then, don't look.

13:16.362 --> 13:17.463
You're not supposed to be
looking at anybody else

13:17.530 --> 13:18.497
while you're
still with me anyway.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.206
{\an8}Why you moving?

13:27.273 --> 13:28.274
{\an8}'Cause I gotta get
to the grape.

13:28.340 --> 13:29.441
{\an1}No, the grape is
going in your mouth.

13:29.508 --> 13:30.609
{\an5}Stop moving.

13:29.508 --> 13:30.609
It's not.

13:30.676 --> 13:31.844
{\an8}After talking to Dreux,

13:31.911 --> 13:33.445
{\an8}hopefully
when he sits down with Rich,

13:33.512 --> 13:35.080
{\an8}he'll see the competent and
trustworthy man

13:35.147 --> 13:36.482
{\an8}that I believe Rich to be.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.450
I just hope that Rich is okay
with meeting Dreux

13:38.517 --> 13:40.819
because Dreux is always
gonna be a part of my life

13:40.886 --> 13:43.522
and I definitely need the two
of them to get along.

13:43.589 --> 13:45.624
{\an1}Yo, how did we get here?
How did we get here?

13:45.691 --> 13:47.660
'Cause this is, like...
this is where we are.

13:47.726 --> 13:50.729
We don't even bang it
out like crazy anymore.

13:50.796 --> 13:53.966
It's like we're
already married.

13:54.033 --> 13:56.569
Things are getting
pretty serious.

13:56.635 --> 13:58.971
So it's time for
a serious conversation.

14:00.072 --> 14:02.308
So, I talked to Dreux--

14:02.374 --> 14:04.710
we were out
with Kammy--

14:04.777 --> 14:08.447
and he wants
to meet you.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.382
{\an5}And I feel like...

14:08.514 --> 14:10.382
Meet me, for what?

14:10.449 --> 14:11.884
So he was just
kind of like, you know,

14:11.951 --> 14:13.252
"I've heard some things,"
and he was like,

14:13.319 --> 14:14.887
I just want to meet him
and feel out the man"

14:14.954 --> 14:18.591
that's gonna be the male
figure in his son's life

14:18.657 --> 14:20.726
whenever he's not
around, and for me,

14:20.793 --> 14:23.395
it's just one more
testament, you know,

14:23.462 --> 14:25.531
of how serious you are.

14:25.598 --> 14:27.099
{\an1}This is my--
Okay.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.500
I hear what you saying.

14:28.567 --> 14:33.205
{\an1}But what we not gonna do
is have me in another situation

14:33.272 --> 14:35.074
{\an1}like I was with your mom,
where I'm being--

14:35.140 --> 14:36.308
I don't think--

14:36.375 --> 14:38.177
{\an1}Because what I'm not doing
is explaining stuff

14:38.244 --> 14:40.346
{\an1}that happened on the
Internet to another dude.

14:40.412 --> 14:43.415
Like, to your mom, okay,
I get, but another dude?

14:43.482 --> 14:45.150
{\an1}Now I'm starting
to feel a way.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.052
{\an1}Like, I'm not out here
to be interrogated.

14:47.119 --> 14:48.587
Yo, this is getting
to be too much.

14:48.654 --> 14:51.123
{\an8}I love Moniece, but I feel like
I'm going through hoops

14:51.190 --> 14:53.025
{\an8}trying to please her
left and right,

14:53.092 --> 14:55.961
especially when I keep hearing
what people have heard about me.

14:56.028 --> 14:57.062
Yo, true story?

14:57.129 --> 14:59.331
I'm through
defending myself.

14:59.398 --> 15:02.101
So I don't see the point
in continuing on

15:02.167 --> 15:03.869
if you don't
have intentions

15:03.936 --> 15:06.238
{\an1}on making this effort for
everything, then you're right,

15:06.305 --> 15:08.007
you don't need to go
sit with my baby daddy.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.775
{\an1}Out of 100 things
that I've done,

15:09.842 --> 15:11.277
{\an1}that you can actually
sit here and say, "Well,

15:11.343 --> 15:12.978
{\an1}if you don't plan on
being together,"

15:13.045 --> 15:14.913
{\an1}everything I've done
thus far would indicate

15:14.980 --> 15:16.048
that that's what it is,

15:16.115 --> 15:18.250
{\an1}so therefore, meeting
your baby father--

15:18.317 --> 15:19.885
{\an1}It's-- it's not
all or nothing, Mo.

15:19.952 --> 15:20.886
It's not all or nothing.

15:20.953 --> 15:21.920
{\an5}Maybe it is, though.

15:20.953 --> 15:21.920
{\an1}I'm not--

15:21.987 --> 15:23.022
{\an1}Well, then it's not
gonna work.

15:23.088 --> 15:23.989
{\an5}Because I know--

15:23.088 --> 15:23.989
Maybe I don't need

15:24.056 --> 15:25.090
to meet your baby father.

15:25.157 --> 15:26.392
Because I know where
I want to be--

15:26.458 --> 15:28.027
{\an1}Because sitting here,
and everything you feel

15:28.093 --> 15:29.561
like is an obligation,

15:29.628 --> 15:31.563
{\an1}I'm obligated to do everything
you've asked me to do

15:31.630 --> 15:33.399
{\an1}when I've asked you
to do nothing?

15:33.465 --> 15:35.200
{\an1}I would venture to
say that me being out here

15:35.267 --> 15:37.436
{\an1}across the country,
starting off,

15:37.503 --> 15:39.371
two, meeting mom,

15:39.438 --> 15:42.207
three, all the other stuff
that's happened since then.

15:42.274 --> 15:45.544
{\an1}So if meeting your baby's father
is just one of another thing

15:45.611 --> 15:49.848
{\an1}that I'm gonna do
to show you that I'm here,

15:49.915 --> 15:52.651
{\an1}I will do it, but I will not
allow this (bleep)

15:52.718 --> 15:54.019
to explode in my face.

15:54.086 --> 15:55.321
I don't know what the hell
is wrong with Rich,

15:55.387 --> 15:56.655
but he should be
supporting me

15:56.722 --> 15:58.490
and he should want
to meet my son's father.

15:58.557 --> 15:59.925
If Rich and Dreux
can't play nice,

15:59.992 --> 16:01.727
then that's
a problem for Rich,

16:01.794 --> 16:03.662
because Dreux's not
going anywhere.

16:03.729 --> 16:06.999
I don't care what he says
to you that angers you.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.735
{\an1}If it goes left and you decide
to handle it a certain way,

16:09.802 --> 16:11.503
then this
relationship is over.

16:11.570 --> 16:12.538
{\an1}That's all I needed
to hear.

16:12.604 --> 16:13.706
{\an1}I'm going to
play basketball.

16:13.772 --> 16:14.840
{\an1}I'll handle it
how I want to handle it.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.482
{\an8}(Apryl)
So life is amazing right now.

16:23.549 --> 16:26.752
{\an8}Although it's a bit of a blur,
because I have my son Megaa,

16:26.819 --> 16:28.520
{\an8}and it's a lot of
craziness going on.

16:28.587 --> 16:30.122
So today we're here
on Big Boy

16:30.189 --> 16:33.492
to do an interview with Omari
for his new single, "I'm Up,"

16:33.559 --> 16:36.195
and to talk about his tour
with Chris Brown.

16:36.261 --> 16:37.730
Uh-oh, family!

16:37.796 --> 16:39.732
{\an4}Hey!

16:37.796 --> 16:39.732
How you doing, my brother?

16:39.798 --> 16:42.034
Hello...
how art thou?

16:42.101 --> 16:43.035
{\an5}Y'all ready to get down?

16:42.101 --> 16:43.035
{\an1}Yeah.

16:43.102 --> 16:44.470
As we should.

16:44.536 --> 16:46.372
So Omari has been doing this
for a very long time.

16:46.438 --> 16:48.173
He's endured
some ups and downs,

16:48.240 --> 16:50.776
but at this moment, we're just
enjoying the ride,

16:50.843 --> 16:54.980
so I'm hoping that one day,
my moment can come, too.

16:55.047 --> 16:57.516
{\an1}Real 92.3, L.A.'s hip-hop and
R&amp;B and it's going down.

16:57.583 --> 16:59.651
I told you that we would
have this man up in here.

16:59.718 --> 17:01.286
The sensation
that we call Omarion.

17:01.353 --> 17:02.588
{\an1}Right.

17:02.654 --> 17:03.856
You know what I love
about this, too, man?

17:03.922 --> 17:05.790
Is that you didn't come
solo up in here.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.025
{\an1}Oh, no, I got
my lady with me.

17:07.092 --> 17:08.727
Man, how you doing,
my love?

17:08.794 --> 17:10.128
I'm good, how are you?

17:10.194 --> 17:11.630
Put that mic a little closer
to you-- sure, you're right.

17:11.696 --> 17:14.133
{\an1}Apryl, you probably don't do a
whole lot of interviews, though.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.567
{\an4}No.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.567
I heard that.

17:15.634 --> 17:17.569
Omarion,
"Pose to Be."

17:17.636 --> 17:18.804
Congratulations, brother.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.806
{\an5}"Pose to Be" just went platinum.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.806
Certified.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.574
{\an1}And then, you know, I broke
Mariah Carey's record

17:22.641 --> 17:26.944
{\an1}for the longest number-one
single in between a gap.

17:27.012 --> 17:29.081
{\an1}The tour is going down also,
One Hell of a Night.

17:29.148 --> 17:30.549
{\an1}Yep, One Hell of
a Night Tour, yep.

17:30.616 --> 17:31.683
So are you going out
on the road, Apryl?

17:31.750 --> 17:33.118
Absolutely.

17:33.185 --> 17:35.220
{\an1}You know he's not gonna let me
leave without taking Megaa.

17:35.287 --> 17:36.955
{\an5}I can't leave without my boy.

17:35.287 --> 17:36.955
Oh, yeah, yeah.

17:37.022 --> 17:38.056
{\an7}(Apryl)
So I gotta be there.

17:38.123 --> 17:39.558
{\an8}Yeah, you definitely
not gonna be no--

17:39.625 --> 17:41.126
{\an7}"Put the phone right there,
let me say hello to him."

17:41.193 --> 17:42.694
Yeah, yeah, no.

17:42.761 --> 17:45.697
{\an1}But how did the balance come,
now, Apryl, with being mom?

17:45.764 --> 17:49.234
You know what I'm saying,
being a supporter?

17:49.301 --> 17:50.936
{\an1}It's like I had to figure out
how to be able to be there,

17:51.003 --> 17:52.905
support him, make sure
that he sees his son,

17:52.971 --> 17:53.972
{\an1}but still
be able to, like,

17:54.039 --> 17:55.908
{\an1}have my life outside
of that, too,

17:55.974 --> 17:58.610
{\an1}so I've just
figured it out.

17:58.677 --> 18:02.381
So when I first met Omari,
we were both musicians,

18:02.448 --> 18:03.882
so at this
particular point,

18:03.949 --> 18:05.984
I'm trying to just be patient
while, you know,

18:06.051 --> 18:08.520
my man is just doing his thing,
but as more time passes,

18:08.587 --> 18:11.523
it just seems like my
opportunity to want to be

18:11.590 --> 18:14.159
a musician is dwindling.

18:14.226 --> 18:15.360
{\an1}So the reason why I moved to
L.A. was for my music.

18:15.427 --> 18:16.695
I heard that.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.864
{\an1}So, you know, that's what
I'm working on now.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.767
{\an1}Where's the support at, O,
for the artist side with April?

18:21.834 --> 18:23.469
{\an1}Right.

18:23.535 --> 18:25.204
{\an1}You know, all in time,
you know what I'm saying?

18:25.270 --> 18:27.573
{\an6}Yeah.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.573
Right now, you know, we're--

18:27.639 --> 18:30.542
{\an1}She's supporting me,
like any great woman would.

18:30.609 --> 18:33.979
{\an8}I don't doubt my baby wanting to
show her talent to the world,

18:34.046 --> 18:36.081
{\an8}and we're definitely
gonna pursue this,

18:36.148 --> 18:38.484
{\an8}but it's all
about the right timing,

18:38.550 --> 18:40.385
and because of the experience
that I have,

18:40.452 --> 18:42.154
we're not just
gonna jump at everything.

18:42.221 --> 18:43.689
You know, we're gonna
take our time.

18:43.755 --> 18:44.857
{\an1}When it's the
right time, you know,

18:44.923 --> 18:46.692
{\an1}I will be up here,
you know, pressing play.

18:46.758 --> 18:48.260
As we should.

18:48.327 --> 18:49.795
{\an1}Apryl, when you ready, you come
in here and we press play.

18:49.862 --> 18:50.996
Oh, I'm coming.

18:51.063 --> 18:52.097
Y'all stick around
y'all radios, man,

18:52.164 --> 18:53.265
we got Omarion
up in here,

18:53.332 --> 18:54.399
we got the queen
Apryl up in here.

18:54.466 --> 18:55.567
Y'all stick around
y'all radios.

18:55.634 --> 18:58.337
Real 92.3,
L.A.'s hip-hop and R&amp;B.

18:58.403 --> 19:01.106
{\an7}I just want to make sure that
I'm still not forgotten.

19:01.173 --> 19:02.941
{\an8}Sharpen up and wait
for your moment.

19:03.008 --> 19:05.277
{\an7}The fact that you think it's
okay for you to go dance

19:05.344 --> 19:06.678
{\an8}after I told you that you
shouldn't go do it.

19:06.745 --> 19:07.880
{\an8}I don't give a (bleep).

19:07.946 --> 19:09.214
{\an8}Go do that (bleep)
by yourself then.

19:09.281 --> 19:10.482
{\an7}What the (bleep)
that supposed to mean?

19:10.549 --> 19:11.583
{\an8}Get the (bleep) out
and do it yourself.

19:11.650 --> 19:12.518
{\an7}Willie, I'm not
finna do it right now

19:12.584 --> 19:13.852
{\an7}with your dumb butt,
I'm not.

19:20.125 --> 19:22.027
♪♪

19:24.096 --> 19:25.731
{\an1}(Apryl)
So the interview went good.

19:25.797 --> 19:28.634
{\an8}Always super cool with--
with Big, you know.

19:28.700 --> 19:29.735
{\an8}When he was asking me
kind of, like, what--

19:29.801 --> 19:30.836
{\an8}what are you doing?

19:30.903 --> 19:32.337
{\an5}Right.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.337
Like, what are you doing, Apryl?

19:32.404 --> 19:33.772
{\an1}And it's like,
I'm doing my music,

19:33.839 --> 19:36.008
{\an1}but it's not like I can really
go into any details,

19:36.074 --> 19:37.876
{\an1}because, I'm, like,
in the beginning stages,

19:37.943 --> 19:39.177
{\an5}you know what I'm saying?

19:37.943 --> 19:39.177
Right.

19:39.244 --> 19:41.580
{\an1}And it's like, I'm relying
on the simple fact

19:41.647 --> 19:43.415
{\an1}that you're gonna help me,
so my thing is that--

19:43.482 --> 19:45.651
Exactly, so rely on it.

19:45.717 --> 19:47.352
{\an1}No, I know,
I am gonna rely on it.

19:47.419 --> 19:48.787
{\an6}Rely on it.

19:47.419 --> 19:48.787
That's why I'm bringing this up,

19:48.854 --> 19:50.756
because I'm just telling you
that I'm getting to a place

19:50.822 --> 19:53.592
where I just want to make sure
that I'm still not forgotten.

19:53.659 --> 19:55.327
Apryl, when you're
asking me whether or not

19:55.394 --> 19:57.229
I'm not forgetting about
you or not, that ain't--

19:57.296 --> 19:58.630
No, I'm just saying, I'm just
done with people where I put

19:58.697 --> 19:59.765
{\an1}my life in your hands,
almost, in a sense.

19:59.831 --> 20:00.899
I know,
that's your insecurity,

20:00.966 --> 20:02.000
don't have nothing
to do with me.

20:02.067 --> 20:03.135
{\an1}That's not my
insecurity, I'm saying--

20:03.201 --> 20:04.369
{\an3}But it is.

20:04.436 --> 20:05.804
{\an1}Where I've put life in other
people's hands,

20:05.871 --> 20:07.906
{\an5}and waiting on people because--

20:05.871 --> 20:07.906
How long you waiting?

20:07.973 --> 20:09.074
What do you mean?

20:09.141 --> 20:10.709
{\an1}Just like in this
relationship now, I'm--

20:10.776 --> 20:13.645
{\an1}One person has to give up
something and I'm that person

20:13.712 --> 20:15.047
{\an5}who's given up something.

20:13.712 --> 20:15.047
Right.

20:15.113 --> 20:16.782
So what I'm saying is that
in most other relationships

20:16.848 --> 20:18.083
that I've been in,

20:18.150 --> 20:20.118
{\an1}I've always been
the one that has sacrificed.

20:20.185 --> 20:21.219
{\an3}Right.

20:21.286 --> 20:22.588
{\an1}And have waited,
and then it's like...

20:22.654 --> 20:24.890
{\an5}And then what--

20:22.654 --> 20:24.890
Mother(bleep) turn out to be

20:24.957 --> 20:26.792
{\an1}ain't (bleep) people,
so what I'm saying is--

20:26.858 --> 20:28.327
{\an5}But you don't--

20:26.858 --> 20:28.327
{\an1}And I don't believe
you are not that way,

20:28.393 --> 20:30.596
{\an1}but I just don't
want to be forgotten.

20:30.662 --> 20:31.830
{\an8}Even though I support Omari

20:31.897 --> 20:33.899
{\an8}and I'm always
being there for him,

20:33.966 --> 20:35.934
{\an8}I'm hoping that when it
becomes my turn,

20:36.001 --> 20:39.104
{\an8}Omari can do the same,
you know?

20:39.171 --> 20:41.239
I just really want
him to just be there

20:41.306 --> 20:44.076
and give me guidance
and just show me

20:44.142 --> 20:49.848
that he really believes in me,
as my partner and as an artist.

20:49.915 --> 20:52.584
{\an1}So all I'm saying is just that
I need to believe in myself

20:52.651 --> 20:54.419
{\an1}that my partner got
my back and that's the reason

20:54.486 --> 20:56.021
{\an1}why I wanted to have
a conversation with you.

20:56.088 --> 20:59.124
{\an1}You acting like you can't--
you can't sharpen your skill.

20:59.191 --> 21:00.392
{\an5}You acting like--

20:59.191 --> 21:00.392
Of course, I--

21:00.459 --> 21:01.493
Exactly, so--

21:01.560 --> 21:02.961
{\an1}People can always
sharpen their skill.

21:03.028 --> 21:04.596
So sharpen up, sharpen up
and wait for your moment.

21:04.663 --> 21:06.898
What if my moment is now
and it's passing us by?

21:06.965 --> 21:09.167
(laughing)
That's a negative outlook.

21:09.234 --> 21:10.202
If you believe that,
then you--

21:10.268 --> 21:11.403
{\an1}But I'm just
saying, that's--

21:11.470 --> 21:13.405
You can't just say.

21:13.472 --> 21:16.541
It's so important to be
proactive in your skill.

21:16.608 --> 21:19.144
Really, that's all I'm trying to
help Apryl understand, like,

21:19.211 --> 21:20.946
you could be doing
more with your time.

21:21.013 --> 21:23.715
Singing every morning, you know,
do your warm-ups,

21:23.782 --> 21:27.819
do something that is
gonna encourage your confidence.

21:27.886 --> 21:29.321
{\an1}I just wanted to
have this conversation

21:29.388 --> 21:30.922
{\an1}'cause I just want to make sure
you didn't forget about me

21:30.989 --> 21:32.257
{\an1}because it's
a lot going on.

21:32.324 --> 21:33.992
{\an1}Apryl, I would never forget
about you, baby.

21:34.059 --> 21:36.695
What are you
talking about?

21:36.762 --> 21:39.698
All I'm saying, baby,
don't worry, okay?

21:39.765 --> 21:41.466
This man right here,
got your front,

21:41.533 --> 21:43.035
your back,
your side, okay?

21:48.540 --> 21:50.442
{\an8}(camera clicking)

21:53.612 --> 21:56.515
{\an5}(Hazel)
After talking to Nikki, I
decided to go ahead and step in

21:56.581 --> 21:58.750
and help the girls out
with this fashion show,

21:58.817 --> 22:01.086
{\an8}but I'm gonna need
a few more designers

22:01.153 --> 22:03.822
{\an8}to make this show
a huge event.

22:03.889 --> 22:05.657
After seeing T.T.
after her surgery,

22:05.724 --> 22:08.026
I have zero confidence
that old girl

22:08.093 --> 22:09.394
is gonna be
ready in time,

22:09.461 --> 22:11.530
and I know Nikki has
her reservations,

22:11.596 --> 22:13.365
but I reached out
to someone who I knew

22:13.432 --> 22:14.766
would be perfect
for the show.

22:18.036 --> 22:20.172
(photographer)
That's hot, Hazel.

22:20.238 --> 22:22.274
Get 'em, Hazel.

22:22.340 --> 22:23.442
Thank you for coming.

22:23.508 --> 22:24.843
Hi, you look
so beautiful.

22:24.910 --> 22:26.278
{\an3}Thank you.

22:26.344 --> 22:28.613
Now, I know Teairra's gonna
feel some type of way

22:28.680 --> 22:30.749
about me asking
Miss Princess Love

22:30.816 --> 22:32.551
to be a part of this
fashion show, but hell,

22:32.617 --> 22:34.920
we need designers
and she's in bed

22:34.986 --> 22:37.022
with cold packs
all over her body.

22:37.089 --> 22:39.558
At this point, we've got to
choose royalties

22:39.624 --> 22:42.127
before loyalties,
so I don't give a (bleep)

22:42.194 --> 22:43.628
if the bitch is mad
or not.

22:43.695 --> 22:46.298
It's about that coin
at the end of the day, baby.

22:46.364 --> 22:47.999
I'm loving this dress.

22:48.066 --> 22:50.202
Thank you, thank you.

22:50.268 --> 22:52.304
{\an1}So, I do want
to tell you, though,

22:52.370 --> 22:56.007
{\an1}I met up with Teairra
and Nikki, and you know,

22:56.074 --> 22:57.776
Nikki is doing her
Nude By Nikki line.

22:57.843 --> 22:59.344
{\an5}Yeah.

22:57.843 --> 22:59.344
And then Teairra has

22:59.411 --> 23:02.147
{\an1}her blazers that we had
talked about before.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.683
They were trying to do an event
to launch their brands, but...

23:04.750 --> 23:05.917
{\an3}Okay.

23:05.984 --> 23:08.086
{\an1}Teairra just recently
underwent some surgery.

23:08.153 --> 23:09.454
Well, good for her.

23:09.521 --> 23:10.956
You know, she had a little
cosmetic surgery, you know,

23:11.022 --> 23:12.958
and T is down.

23:13.024 --> 23:14.926
{\an1}Nikki's never produced
an event before,

23:14.993 --> 23:17.896
{\an1}but she wants her pieces
showcased in the best light,

23:17.963 --> 23:20.599
{\an1}so I wanted to see
where you were at, like,

23:20.665 --> 23:22.033
with your pieces
and everything,

23:22.100 --> 23:23.502
{\an1}to make sure we
still on the same page.

23:23.568 --> 23:25.237
{\an5}Everything is ready to go.

23:23.568 --> 23:25.237
Okay, perfect.

23:25.303 --> 23:27.205
So, I'm excited
to let everybody see.

23:27.272 --> 23:30.876
{\an1}So if you could put your little,
you know, situation aside...

23:30.942 --> 23:32.444
{\an8}That's not even--
that's in the past.

23:32.511 --> 23:34.179
{\an8}I'm done, I washed
my hands of it.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.580
{\an7}Okay.

23:35.647 --> 23:36.782
{\an1}Just as long as she
doesn't say anything to me,

23:36.848 --> 23:38.383
or even if she does,
I'll still keep it cute,

23:38.450 --> 23:40.852
{\an1}but I will not ruin your event,
so don't worry about that.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.788
{\an1}No, I know.
We do this, so...

23:42.854 --> 23:46.625
Right, now, but is she
on the same page as us?

23:46.691 --> 23:50.595
I just need to make sure we're
not bringing couture, you know,

23:50.662 --> 23:53.932
{\an1}high-end fashion and she's
coming with Payless, Wal-Mart.

23:53.999 --> 23:55.367
{\an1}Yeah, and I'm not
gonna let--

23:55.433 --> 23:57.269
{\an1}'Cause first of all,
this is a business situation,

23:57.335 --> 24:00.338
and if I bust up my ass
to make our bar up here

24:00.405 --> 24:02.307
and I'm gonna bring it A1,

24:02.374 --> 24:05.544
{\an1}I need everybody who's coming
with me to be on A1, too.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.679
{\an5}Exactly.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.679
And, like, if she can't,

24:07.746 --> 24:10.682
{\an1}then I gotta bust my move
without her, I tried.

24:10.749 --> 24:13.518
We just can't let her
make us look bad.

24:20.992 --> 24:23.328
{\an5}(Willie)
Getting out of my contract was
such a big weight off of my

24:23.395 --> 24:26.097
shoulders and now things are
finally looking up.

24:26.164 --> 24:27.999
I can't wait to get
my music back out there,

24:28.066 --> 24:30.101
{\an8}so tonight Screwface set up a
small performance,

24:30.168 --> 24:32.304
{\an8}just so I can,
you know, get my feet wet

24:32.370 --> 24:34.706
and get ready for these big
crowds once again.

24:34.773 --> 24:37.409
{\an8}Hey...

24:34.773 --> 24:37.409
{\an7}What up?

24:37.475 --> 24:39.277
{\an8}How are you, Willie?

24:37.475 --> 24:39.277
{\an8}What's up?

24:39.344 --> 24:40.378
{\an8}I'm really proud Willie's

24:40.445 --> 24:41.947
{\an8}getting back on that stage
tonight,

24:42.013 --> 24:45.383
{\an8}but when he invited Nikki and
Fizz, I had my reservations.

24:45.450 --> 24:47.219
I've been working at Nikki's
club on the low,

24:47.285 --> 24:48.753
and Willie has no idea.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.789
{\an5}Thanks for coming, too.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.789
Of course, man.

24:50.856 --> 24:52.224
Really appreciate it.

24:52.290 --> 24:53.258
Are you ready to
kill it or what?

24:53.325 --> 24:54.659
I'm definitely gonna kill it.

24:54.726 --> 24:55.794
{\an1}'Cause you know, I've never
been to your performance.

24:55.861 --> 24:56.928
{\an5}I'd like to see what you got.

24:55.861 --> 24:56.928
{\an3}Okay.

24:56.995 --> 24:58.463
Well, prepare to be
entertained.

24:58.530 --> 25:01.266
{\an1}Shanda entertains me enough
on the stage, okay?

25:01.333 --> 25:02.634
What happened?

25:02.701 --> 25:03.969
{\an1}I know, she was looking--
I was like, is that Shanda?

25:04.035 --> 25:05.437
{\an1}I'm like, hold on,
I can't even look at that.

25:05.503 --> 25:07.172
{\an3}Where?

25:07.239 --> 25:10.675
{\an1}You know, Shanda been dancing
for us, in one of my clubs.

25:10.742 --> 25:12.344
You didn't know that?

25:12.410 --> 25:14.379
Oh (bleep).

25:14.446 --> 25:15.480
What you mean?

25:15.547 --> 25:16.882
(Shanda)
Oh, my God.

25:16.948 --> 25:19.084
I hate the fact Willie
had to find out this way.

25:19.150 --> 25:20.685
I was gonna eventually
tell him,

25:20.752 --> 25:22.888
but I wasn't gonna
do it right here, for sure.

25:22.954 --> 25:24.222
Why do you feel like
you have to do it?

25:24.289 --> 25:25.624
{\an5}Because you lied to me.

25:24.289 --> 25:25.624
Lied to you about what?

25:25.690 --> 25:28.226
{\an1}I came to the studio the other
day, I spoke to Screwface.

25:28.293 --> 25:30.629
{\an9}And?

25:28.293 --> 25:30.629
{\an8}And he told me that, oh,

25:30.695 --> 25:33.331
{\an7}Willie's upset because he can't
get out of his contract.

25:33.398 --> 25:34.666
Okay, I was working on it.

25:34.733 --> 25:36.101
However, I didn't ask you
for no damn help,

25:36.167 --> 25:37.636
so why would you go dance?

25:37.702 --> 25:41.039
{\an8}I had no idea that Willie didn't
know Shanda was working for me.

25:41.106 --> 25:42.207
{\an8}I feel terrible.

25:42.274 --> 25:44.376
{\an8}And this is going south
really fast.

25:44.442 --> 25:45.844
{\an8}I can't even watch.

25:45.911 --> 25:48.179
Who is gonna be, you know,
the money maker here?

25:48.246 --> 25:49.648
If I need your help,
I'll ask you for it,

25:49.714 --> 25:51.349
{\an1}and I said that (bleep) before
and here it is again.

25:51.416 --> 25:52.984
{\an1}But it's obvious that
you need some type of help,

25:53.051 --> 25:54.953
{\an1}because you're not
bringing (bleep) in.

25:55.020 --> 25:56.988
{\an1}But you haven't discussed
this (bleep) with me at all.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.924
{\an1}What the (bleep) I'm
discussing it with you for?

25:58.990 --> 26:00.725
Did you discuss with me that you
didn't get out of that contract

26:00.792 --> 26:02.527
when I (bleep) asked you?

26:02.594 --> 26:03.795
It wasn't the time.

26:03.862 --> 26:05.363
{\an1}What the (bleep)
you expect me to do?

26:05.430 --> 26:06.364
{\an1}Especially with your
lying ass.

26:06.431 --> 26:07.866
Are you serious?

26:07.933 --> 26:09.968
Hollywood is a small town,
and I couldn't expect Willie

26:10.035 --> 26:11.703
to never find out,
but so what?

26:11.770 --> 26:14.239
He needed money and I
couldn't let the lights go off

26:14.306 --> 26:17.442
and not have enough food on
the table to feed my kids.

26:17.509 --> 26:19.945
{\an1}I am making ends meet
for our family.

26:20.011 --> 26:23.048
I needed right now money, so I
got it right the (bleep) now,

26:23.114 --> 26:24.749
so I'm cool right now.

26:24.816 --> 26:26.685
{\an1}The fact that you think it's
okay for you to go dance

26:26.751 --> 26:27.686
after I told you that
you shouldn't go do it.

26:27.752 --> 26:28.987
I don't give a (bleep).

26:29.054 --> 26:30.155
{\an5}And you didn't even let me know.

26:29.054 --> 26:30.155
What, what, what?

26:30.221 --> 26:31.289
So I have to start
finding out now.

26:31.356 --> 26:32.457
{\an1}So we can be in
a (bleep) up situation?

26:32.524 --> 26:33.591
So I'm finding out now.

26:33.658 --> 26:34.993
{\an1}I'm never gonna
allow that to happen.

26:35.060 --> 26:36.094
{\an1}Okay, well, go do that (bleep)
by yourself, then.

26:36.161 --> 26:37.362
{\an1}What the (bleep)
that supposed to mean?

26:37.429 --> 26:38.463
Get the (bleep) out
and do it yourself.

26:38.530 --> 26:39.464
{\an1}Willie, I'm not finna
do it right now

26:39.531 --> 26:41.032
{\an1}with your dumb butt,
I'm not.

26:41.099 --> 26:42.100
I'm not, I'm not.

26:44.903 --> 26:46.538
(bleep) ass (bleep).

26:46.604 --> 26:48.573
{\an7}You don't have to
do that for us.

26:48.640 --> 26:51.576
{\an7}I'll do whatever the (bleep)
I gotta do, for us.

26:51.643 --> 26:52.610

Just when I got my
contract situation resolved,

I can't believe we're
at this place

27:50.168 --> 27:52.237
where we're saying these type
of things to each other,

27:52.303 --> 27:54.873
{\an8}but the last thing I would want
is for us to be torn apart

27:54.939 --> 27:57.742
{\an8}when we're both just trying to
make it happen for our family.

28:02.147 --> 28:04.082
They locked all
the doors on us.

28:04.149 --> 28:05.750
{\an5}Good show, right?

28:04.149 --> 28:05.750
Hell, yeah.

28:09.854 --> 28:10.855
Hey, bro let me get at her.

28:14.259 --> 28:16.961
{\an3}I'm sorry.

28:17.028 --> 28:19.798
I just felt like I needed
to do that for us.

28:19.864 --> 28:21.132
I've always
been there for you.

28:21.199 --> 28:22.333
When I first started
doing this,

28:22.400 --> 28:25.370
I never wanted to
do it and you know that.

28:25.437 --> 28:26.738
I just want to
see you make it.

28:26.805 --> 28:28.640
I don't want any of
that energy to be on you,

28:28.706 --> 28:30.675
so I feel like it was
up to me to make sure

28:30.742 --> 28:32.811
that everything was good,
all the bills,

28:32.877 --> 28:35.613
all that (bleep) because
it was hard for you,

28:35.680 --> 28:37.449
so I just did--
I just did it.

28:37.515 --> 28:40.151
not to do what you
didn't want me to do,

28:40.218 --> 28:44.389
{\an1}but do what I knew
that I could for my family.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.891
First off, don't cry.

28:46.958 --> 28:47.959
You understand?

28:48.026 --> 28:49.627
I really didn't
want to do that.

28:49.694 --> 28:50.995
I understand that.

28:51.062 --> 28:53.565
{\an1}And I understand that I'm not
right 'cause I did lie.

28:53.631 --> 28:56.000
{\an1}I said that I was
out of the contract,

28:56.067 --> 28:58.703
{\an1}and I wasn't out of the contract
at the time, but I'm out now.

28:58.770 --> 29:00.305
{\an1}You just got to
trust me sometimes.

29:00.371 --> 29:01.940
I just came all the way
out to California

29:02.006 --> 29:02.974
and I just didn't want us
to be in that situation.

29:03.041 --> 29:04.342
But you can't be scared.

29:04.409 --> 29:07.479
{\an1}We came together,
we didn't come to fail.

29:07.545 --> 29:08.913
{\an1}I'm not thinking with
a losing head.

29:11.749 --> 29:13.651
Just saying, that's nothing
I really wanted to just do.

29:13.718 --> 29:16.154
I feel like it's something
I had to do for us.

29:16.221 --> 29:18.323
{\an1}No, you don't
have to do that for us.

29:18.389 --> 29:20.058
{\an1}You don't have to do
that for us.

29:20.125 --> 29:23.394
{\an1}I'll do whatever the (bleep)
I gotta do for us.

29:23.461 --> 29:27.198
{\an1}But you don't
have to do that, for us.

29:27.265 --> 29:28.833
When I dealt with it at the
time that I dealt with it,

29:28.900 --> 29:30.969
it hurt me.

29:31.035 --> 29:32.437
{\an1}I don't want to
hurt no more.

29:35.640 --> 29:36.641
{\an4}Okay?

29:35.640 --> 29:36.641
I'm sorry.

29:39.711 --> 29:42.480
{\an5}That (bleep) hurt, babe.

29:39.711 --> 29:42.480
{\an3}(crying)

29:42.547 --> 29:44.115
{\an1}Don't cry.

29:44.182 --> 29:45.550
{\an1}You okay?

29:45.617 --> 29:47.752
{\an8}Obviously, Moniece
has mentioned you.

29:47.819 --> 29:49.354
{\an8}You know what I mean?

29:47.819 --> 29:49.354
{\an7}Right.

29:49.420 --> 29:51.456
{\an8}I only know so much about you
from what I hear on, you know,

29:51.523 --> 29:53.024
{\an8}media and all
that other stuff.

29:53.091 --> 29:55.326
{\an8}That's not who I am.

29:55.393 --> 29:57.295
{\an7}We might have built a bridge
and got across it.

29:57.362 --> 29:58.763
{\an9}Yeah.

29:58.830 --> 30:01.332
{\an8}But, I know I never slept with
my best friend's ex-boyfriend.

30:01.399 --> 30:03.001
{\an8}(Milan)
Oh, my God.

30:09.607 --> 30:11.342
♪♪

30:14.646 --> 30:16.114
{\an8}(Rich)
At the end of the day,

30:16.181 --> 30:17.982
{\an8}I'm feeling like Moniece is
starting to take advantage.

30:18.049 --> 30:19.284
{\an8}I don't feel like
I need to be sitting

30:19.350 --> 30:20.785
with nobody's baby father.

30:20.852 --> 30:22.253
Like, at the end of the day,
that's your relationship,

30:22.320 --> 30:24.055
that's how y'all get down.

30:24.122 --> 30:25.323
I already did this
once with Marla,

30:25.390 --> 30:27.458
and I'm not looking
forward to a repeat.

30:27.525 --> 30:29.494
What's up, man?

30:29.561 --> 30:30.662
{\an5}What up, boy, what up?

30:29.561 --> 30:30.662
{\an1}What's up?

30:30.728 --> 30:32.197
{\an5}How are you?

30:30.728 --> 30:32.197
{\an1}All right.

30:32.263 --> 30:34.933
And believe me, if it's another
man sitting across from me

30:34.999 --> 30:37.735
who's not coming correct,
it could get ugly real quick.

30:37.802 --> 30:38.937
What's the word?

30:39.003 --> 30:40.271
Man, I wanted to come
holler at you

30:40.338 --> 30:43.608
because, obviously
Moniece has mentioned you.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.310
{\an5}You know what I mean?

30:43.675 --> 30:45.310
{\an1}Right.

30:45.376 --> 30:46.911
{\an8}I only know so much about you
from what I hear on, you know,

30:46.978 --> 30:49.113
{\an8}media and all
the other stuff.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.481
{\an8}That's not who I am.

30:50.548 --> 30:53.284
{\an7}Like, I came here today
to give you peace of mind,

30:53.351 --> 30:54.819
{\an7}'cause I'm sure you
had your reservations...

30:54.886 --> 30:56.187
{\an5}Right.

30:54.886 --> 30:56.187
I'm sure you wanted to iron out,

30:56.254 --> 30:57.488
{\an5}as a man, as a man.

30:56.254 --> 30:57.488
Right.

30:57.555 --> 30:59.524
{\an1}So I'm not even gonna front,
I was like, yo,

30:59.591 --> 31:01.025
is this (bleep)
gonna be like--

31:01.092 --> 31:03.795
{\an1}is this (bleep) calling me to
come at me sideways and (bleep)?

31:03.861 --> 31:04.929
Absolutely not.

31:04.996 --> 31:07.098
{\an1}I'm trying to
turn over a new leaf.

31:07.165 --> 31:09.067
Before we get into that,
I want to get your intake

31:09.133 --> 31:11.402
{\an1}on where y'all relationship
is really going.

31:14.806 --> 31:16.774
{\an1}I love her to death,
like, she's a good girl.

31:16.841 --> 31:18.243
{\an1}I mean, she got her
(bleep) with her.

31:18.309 --> 31:19.944
{\an1}Believe me, I know,
I mean, you know that.

31:20.011 --> 31:20.979
{\an3}Right.

31:21.045 --> 31:22.614
{\an1}But I'm here
to see if it'll work,

31:22.680 --> 31:26.951
{\an1}I'm here to do the right thing,
but I can't guarantee that.

31:27.018 --> 31:31.055
{\an1}If you don't feel like that's
where you really going with her,

31:31.122 --> 31:34.425
{\an1}then I would just appreciate,
when y'all spend time,

31:34.492 --> 31:36.661
that my son not
necessarily be around.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.630
{\an1}I got you-- So I understand
where you coming from,

31:38.696 --> 31:41.466
{\an1}you don't want Kam meeting me
and the next thing--

31:41.532 --> 31:43.001
I don't want (bleep)
in and out of his life.

31:43.067 --> 31:44.102
In and out, exactly.

31:44.168 --> 31:45.536
And I can appreciate that.

31:45.603 --> 31:47.238
I just have to
establish that, though.

31:47.305 --> 31:48.273
{\an4}All right.

31:47.305 --> 31:48.273
You feel me?

31:48.339 --> 31:49.707
{\an4}Yeah.

31:48.339 --> 31:49.707
So that is my kid,

31:49.774 --> 31:52.877
{\an1}so I gotta make sure whoever
is around him is in--

31:52.944 --> 31:55.947
{\an1}being that full-on influence,
because I'm his father.

31:56.014 --> 31:58.583
{\an1}If he around me,
what's up, little man?

31:58.650 --> 32:00.318
{\an1}We cool, we kicking it,
I'm uncle.

32:00.385 --> 32:02.453
{\an1}I don't-- I don't want to be
your father, this is--

32:02.520 --> 32:06.190
{\an1}this is you and Moniece's
situation, so y'all handle that.

32:06.257 --> 32:07.792
Now, if I'm around, then
it's just whatever, like,

32:07.859 --> 32:09.360
{\an1}I'm gonna treat him
like he mine.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.329
{\an1}Treat him like yours 'til it's
time to discipline him.

32:11.396 --> 32:12.397
{\an1}I don't want
to discipline him,

32:12.463 --> 32:13.631
{\an5}I don't want no parts of that.

32:12.463 --> 32:13.631
Right.

32:13.698 --> 32:15.867
{\an1}As long as he ain't
in harm's way,

32:15.933 --> 32:17.001
then I'll walk away.

32:17.068 --> 32:18.536
{\an1}If he's playing with fire
or something--

32:18.603 --> 32:22.173
{\an1}Listen, I really-- I appreciate
that, because, as a man,

32:22.240 --> 32:24.509
my son means more than
anything to me.

32:24.575 --> 32:25.843
That's-- that's me.

32:25.910 --> 32:28.212
{\an4}Right.

32:25.910 --> 32:28.212
You feel me?
That's me.

32:28.279 --> 32:30.481
{\an1}And to hear you say that,
that means a lot to me, bro.

32:30.548 --> 32:31.783
{\an1}Right.

32:31.849 --> 32:33.184
I had my reservations
about Rich,

32:33.251 --> 32:35.820
but sitting here and
seeing him being respectful

32:35.887 --> 32:38.623
and saying the right things
when it comes to my son,

32:38.690 --> 32:40.091
I think we all gravy.

32:40.158 --> 32:42.293
{\an1}I wish y'all the best, because
I honestly do see her

32:42.360 --> 32:45.363
{\an1}trying to make a difference
in our son's life,

32:45.430 --> 32:48.232
to paint this
picture for you.

32:48.299 --> 32:51.102
{\an4}Right.

32:48.299 --> 32:51.102
So it's working out for me.

32:51.169 --> 32:52.837
Coming in, I was worried (bleep)
was gonna go left,

32:52.904 --> 32:54.772
but you know what?
I can't even front.

32:54.839 --> 32:56.474
Fizz came at me
the right way.

32:56.541 --> 32:58.009
Thank you,
I appreciate it.

32:58.076 --> 33:00.078
{\an5}You feel me?

for the fashion show,

33:34.078 --> 33:35.947
{\an8}and there's so much to do,

33:36.013 --> 33:37.615
{\an8}it's a good thing
that I stepped in,

33:37.682 --> 33:39.617
{\an8}because T.T. is nowhere
to be found.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.185
With Princess on board,

33:41.252 --> 33:44.088
I also asked Milan to feature
his brand-new underwear line

33:44.155 --> 33:47.358
and bring a little man candy
to the show, so even if T.T.

33:47.425 --> 33:50.061
totally flakes,
we'll still be covered.

33:50.128 --> 33:52.497
{\an1}I feel like I need the Nude
By Nikki up on the thing

33:52.563 --> 33:54.565
and I you're your
bitches catwalking in.

33:54.632 --> 33:55.566
{\an1}My bitches
will be catwalking.

33:55.633 --> 33:58.002
That's what I'm saying.

33:58.069 --> 33:59.170
(Teiarra)
Nikki told me to come down

33:59.237 --> 34:00.805
to the venue
for the model call

34:00.872 --> 34:02.640
{\an8}and I'm hoping that
we can iron out

34:02.707 --> 34:04.542
{\an8}the final details
for the show.

34:04.609 --> 34:06.711
I know that Hazel is
helping out with the event.

34:06.778 --> 34:08.012
I have my patterns.

34:08.079 --> 34:10.214
Now all I need is
some models to measure,

34:10.281 --> 34:13.818
and then the manufacturer
is gonna whip these things out.

34:13.885 --> 34:17.088
It'll be tight, but I know I'll
be ready for the show.

34:17.155 --> 34:18.523
How much time you think
we about to have?

34:18.589 --> 34:19.724
{\an3}Hey, T.T.

34:19.791 --> 34:22.527
{\an5}Hi, T.

34:19.791 --> 34:22.527
Welcome, baby.

34:22.592 --> 34:24.429
{\an5}Hi, boo.

34:22.592 --> 34:24.429
You look great.

34:24.495 --> 34:26.164
{\an1}I mean, it seems like you're
recovering well.

34:26.230 --> 34:28.533
I got a rack for you.

34:28.599 --> 34:30.467
Well, I wanted to do
my stuff fit to size,

34:30.534 --> 34:32.170
{\an1}so I just brought
my patterns.

34:32.235 --> 34:33.871
Wait, T, but when--

34:33.938 --> 34:35.505
when are these
gonna be done, bitch?

34:35.572 --> 34:36.641
{\an5}'Cause my fashion show--

34:35.572 --> 34:36.641
No, no, no.

34:36.706 --> 34:38.141
We have, like,
less than a week.

34:38.208 --> 34:39.377
Yeah, they're
gonna be done.

34:39.444 --> 34:40.545
I'm glad that T.T.
made it here today,

34:40.610 --> 34:42.647
{\an8}but all she got
is some paper patterns?

34:42.713 --> 34:44.382
{\an8}Girl, this is a fitting.

34:44.449 --> 34:45.583
I'm glad that Hazel got
involved,

34:45.650 --> 34:47.051
and maybe
she was right about

34:47.118 --> 34:48.619
bringing in these other
designers.

34:48.686 --> 34:50.688
I'm just worried what T.T.'s
reaction is gonna be

34:50.755 --> 34:52.790
when she finds out.

34:52.857 --> 34:54.192
So, well,
this is the thing.

34:54.257 --> 34:55.893
So, because we're getting
ready for the launch,

34:55.960 --> 34:57.829
I added Milan.
Milan!

34:57.895 --> 34:59.063
{\an5}Oh, Milan's here.

34:57.895 --> 34:59.063
Yeah, Milan--

34:59.130 --> 35:00.465
He's in the show, too.

35:00.531 --> 35:01.999
I thought that-- that we should
have a little man candy

35:02.066 --> 35:03.067
at the event, too.

35:03.134 --> 35:04.569
Yeah, oh, girl,
you see me.

35:04.635 --> 35:06.037
And just so you know,

35:06.103 --> 35:07.939
{\an1}'cause you know I was doing
this event with Princess.

35:08.005 --> 35:09.907
(Teiarra)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, now.

35:09.974 --> 35:11.576
What the hell
is going on here?

35:11.642 --> 35:13.110
First Hazel was
helping out,

35:13.177 --> 35:16.214
now it seems as if she's taken
over the whole damn event.

35:16.280 --> 35:19.517
First of all, nobody ever
told me, Hazel or Nikki,

35:19.584 --> 35:21.953
that we were
bringing on other designers.

35:22.019 --> 35:24.222
And to be honest, all this
has me so flustered

35:24.288 --> 35:26.557
that I didn't even
notice Princess' ass

35:26.624 --> 35:29.193
standing on the other side
of the room.

35:29.260 --> 35:31.462
I'm down for a couple days
because of surgery

35:31.529 --> 35:33.531
and they ask
the one mother(bleep)

35:33.598 --> 35:35.733
that I got a problem with
to join the show?

35:35.800 --> 35:37.268
{\an3}Hey!

35:37.335 --> 35:38.769
I don't want you to change
anything that you're doing.

35:38.836 --> 35:39.837
I think you should do what
you're doing with Princess.

35:39.904 --> 35:41.372
Don't you love this?

35:41.439 --> 35:42.740
I just don't want to be part
of the show, it's okay,

35:42.807 --> 35:44.242
I think that
that's beautiful.

35:44.308 --> 35:46.244
{\an1}When we initially had this idea,
it was me and Teairra's idea.

35:46.310 --> 35:47.678
I'm good.

35:47.745 --> 35:48.846
She doesn't want to do it
because she's not ready.

35:48.913 --> 35:50.248
I'm ready.

35:50.314 --> 35:52.116
Are the models gonna wear
paper down the runway?

35:52.183 --> 35:53.918
Why would you guys even
want this energy

35:53.985 --> 35:55.086
at your fashion show?

35:55.152 --> 35:56.521
I didn't want it.

35:56.587 --> 35:57.955
(all talking at once)

35:58.022 --> 35:59.090
Oh, it's all on me, huh?

35:59.156 --> 36:00.391
But you don't (bleep)--

36:00.458 --> 36:01.893
{\an5}She don't care.

36:00.458 --> 36:01.893
And she should be the one mad.

36:01.959 --> 36:03.027
{\an5}That's the thing.

36:01.959 --> 36:03.027
She should be the one mad,

36:03.094 --> 36:04.328
{\an1}that's what I've been
telling you.

36:04.395 --> 36:05.363
{\an1}I was around y'all
when y'all hung out,

36:05.429 --> 36:06.731
I would be mad, too,

36:06.797 --> 36:08.065
{\an1}but if she willing to let it go,
then you should, too.

36:08.132 --> 36:09.166
You should let it go.

36:09.233 --> 36:10.735
{\an1}You act like me and Hazel
came here

36:10.801 --> 36:12.003
{\an1}to jeopardize your business or
whatever it is you're doing.

36:12.069 --> 36:13.271
I never said
that you did that.

36:13.337 --> 36:14.772
{\an1}I didn't say you did,
but you're acting like--

36:14.839 --> 36:16.641
Oh, you did, and I never--
I never did anything to you.

36:16.707 --> 36:17.775
And all we said was--

36:17.842 --> 36:19.443
Wait, hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.

36:19.510 --> 36:20.745
She said she never
did nothing.

36:20.811 --> 36:21.946
What do you mean?

36:22.013 --> 36:23.347
Let's not say
we never did nothing,

36:23.414 --> 36:25.116
'cause there was a lot of things
that have been done.

36:25.182 --> 36:27.618
Okay, so-- so what's the--
so why are we here?

36:27.685 --> 36:29.420
{\an1}We might have built a bridge
and got across it.

36:29.487 --> 36:30.888
{\an3}Yeah.

36:30.955 --> 36:33.925
But, I know I never slept with
my best friend's ex-boyfriend.

36:33.991 --> 36:35.426
(Milan)
Oh, my God.

36:35.493 --> 36:36.661
{\an8}You disrespect everybody.

36:36.727 --> 36:37.895
{\an8}So why are you so hyped up?

36:37.962 --> 36:39.196
{\an8}Tippy, tippy, top, top--

36:37.962 --> 36:39.196
{\an8}Why are you so hyped--

36:39.263 --> 36:40.765
{\an8}I'm not, 'cause you
keep talking (bleep).

36:40.831 --> 36:43.234
{\an8}Yeah, you talking (bleep) to me.

36:40.831 --> 36:43.234
{\an8}I'm steady, honey, I'm steady.

36:43.301 --> 36:44.569
{\an7}Y'all act like you
(bleep) loyal,

36:44.635 --> 36:46.704
{\an7}you (bleep)
unloyal ass bitch!

36:52.643 --> 36:54.111
♪♪

36:54.178 --> 36:56.414
{\an1}We might have built
a bridge and got across it.

36:56.480 --> 36:57.882
{\an3}Yeah.

36:57.949 --> 37:00.351
But I know I never slept with
my best friend's ex-boyfriend.

37:00.418 --> 37:01.719
(Milan)
Oh, my God.

37:01.786 --> 37:04.422
{\an1}I know for a fact that
that has never happened for me,

37:04.488 --> 37:06.324
{\an1}which is the rule number one
that you don't do.

37:06.390 --> 37:08.859
But everybody has done (bleep),
ain't nobody perfect and it's--

37:08.926 --> 37:10.928
So, all right,
(bleep) so cute.

37:10.995 --> 37:12.029
{\an1}What do you mean
it's so cute?

37:12.096 --> 37:13.798
I love how cute
these bitches are.

37:13.864 --> 37:15.533
{\an5}They're so (bleep) cute.

37:13.864 --> 37:15.533
{\an3}Wait.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.868
{\an5}(Teiarra)
I came here to prepare for a
fashion show with Nikki,

37:17.935 --> 37:20.738
but instead, I got four
fake-ass wannabes

37:20.805 --> 37:22.773
taking sides against me.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.609
And Hazel,
I was by your side

37:24.675 --> 37:28.312
when your nose almost fell off
from your accident in Dubai

37:28.379 --> 37:31.749
and you repay me by bringing up
some old ancient ass

37:31.816 --> 37:33.651
Yung Berg (bleep)?

37:33.718 --> 37:34.986
Really?

37:35.052 --> 37:37.588
{\an1}You talk to Hazel, you talk
to Nikki, so of course,

37:37.655 --> 37:40.358
{\an1}you're gonna respect them,
in their place.

37:40.424 --> 37:42.493
As she should, because
we've given her no reason

37:42.560 --> 37:44.362
to disrespect us,
unlike you.

37:44.428 --> 37:46.130
You have given her reason
to disrespect you,

37:46.197 --> 37:48.232
{\an1}'cause you disrespected
her by going back to her man

37:48.299 --> 37:49.834
and doing some
fraud (bleep).

37:49.900 --> 37:51.702
Just like you disrespected me
and being friends with Masika

37:51.769 --> 37:53.070
and (bleep) Berg's (bleep),

37:53.137 --> 37:54.905
{\an1}just like you disrespected
Nikki by getting in her face

37:54.972 --> 37:56.707
and doing some fraud
(bleep) with Mally.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.275
You disrespect everybody.

37:58.342 --> 38:00.945
I didn't come into this event
with ill intentions.

38:01.012 --> 38:02.980
I just wanted to help
my freakin' friends

38:03.047 --> 38:06.050
with the fashion show,
but (bleep) got real,

38:06.117 --> 38:07.284
and it's like, hold on.

38:07.351 --> 38:08.686
Pause for a minute.

38:08.753 --> 38:10.154
Let me go ahead
and check your ass,

38:10.221 --> 38:12.323
'cause I actually haven't
done that yet.

38:12.390 --> 38:15.092
You (bleep) with the wrong
bitch, Miss Teairra Mari.

38:15.159 --> 38:16.627
I'm not the one, honey.

38:16.694 --> 38:19.597
And I'm calling a mother(bleep)
spade a spade, bitch,

38:19.664 --> 38:21.232
and you the queen ho.

38:21.298 --> 38:22.867
That's the point that
you don't understand

38:22.933 --> 38:24.869
{\an1}and that's what you really need
to get together right now.

38:24.935 --> 38:26.003
It can't be all us.

38:26.070 --> 38:27.605
It has to be you.

38:27.672 --> 38:28.806
{\an3}Own it.

38:28.873 --> 38:30.341
{\an1}So what about it,
so what about it (bleep)?

38:30.408 --> 38:32.910
{\an5}Tippy, tippy, top, top.

38:30.408 --> 38:32.910
Why you so hyped up?

38:32.977 --> 38:34.211
I'm not, 'cause you keep
talking (bleep).

38:34.278 --> 38:35.413
{\an1}Yeah, you talking
(bleep) to me!

38:35.479 --> 38:36.814
I'm steady, honey,
I'm steady.

38:36.881 --> 38:38.649
{\an5}I'm loyal to the end.

38:36.881 --> 38:38.649
No, you not, no, you not.

38:38.716 --> 38:40.618
{\an1}You not loyal to the end
'cause you want to pretend--

38:40.685 --> 38:42.119
I'm not gonna be
loyal to you--

38:42.186 --> 38:44.188
{\an1}...switching up just
as soon as I get in your face!

38:44.255 --> 38:46.190
No, because you came
in here disrespecting.

38:46.257 --> 38:47.925
{\an5}Don't act like you loyal!

38:46.257 --> 38:47.925
If you disrespect me, I (bleep)!

38:47.992 --> 38:50.261
{\an1}Don't act like
you (bleep) loyal!

38:50.327 --> 38:52.063
(both talking at once)

38:52.129 --> 38:53.631
Listening to Teairra
talk about loyalty

38:53.698 --> 38:56.133
has got me
laughing my ass off.

38:56.200 --> 38:59.036
This starting to get fun,
and I just need my popcorn,

38:59.103 --> 39:00.671
'cause this is one hell
of a show.

39:00.738 --> 39:02.073
{\an5}Ooh, T.T.

39:00.738 --> 39:02.073
And you should keep it cute.

39:02.139 --> 39:03.841
{\an1}Yeah.

39:03.908 --> 39:05.910
{\an1}King Kong, King T
in this bitch.

39:05.976 --> 39:06.944
(Bleep) you.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.412
You're a fake ass bitch.

39:08.479 --> 39:09.547
{\an1}I (bleep)
was your friend.

39:09.613 --> 39:11.048
Bitch, when was
you my friend?

39:11.115 --> 39:12.450
{\an1}When you were (bleep) Berg's
(bleep) in the alley

39:12.516 --> 39:13.884
or when you were being
friends with Masika?

39:13.951 --> 39:15.519
{\an1}No, first of all, I never
(bleep) Berg's (bleep).

39:15.586 --> 39:16.721
Maybe that's
(bleeps) him.

39:16.787 --> 39:19.223
{\an1}Girl, ain't nobody
(bleep) nobody.

39:19.290 --> 39:22.326
All of this alley talk
is just nasty.

39:22.393 --> 39:24.862
It's time that these ladies get
over this little boy drama,

39:24.929 --> 39:26.831
put on
their big girl panties,

39:26.897 --> 39:28.833
and start worrying about
this fashion show.

39:28.899 --> 39:30.501
Does anybody
remember that?

39:30.568 --> 39:32.636
You the one who was
being a dumb ass ho

39:32.703 --> 39:34.004
when you knew the (bleep)

39:34.071 --> 39:35.139
{\an1}wasn't yours in the first
(bleep) place.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.408
So let's keep it
all the way, ho.

39:37.475 --> 39:39.176
I think you were (bleep)
for tracks.

39:39.243 --> 39:41.145
No, bitch--
For tracks?

39:41.212 --> 39:43.514
{\an5}Do what you're good at, bitch.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.514
Bitch, do what you're good at.

39:43.581 --> 39:44.648
{\an5}What are you good at?

39:43.581 --> 39:44.648
{\an3}(bleeps)

39:44.715 --> 39:45.716
I'm just
gonna walk her out.

39:45.783 --> 39:47.151
{\an1}Yeah, way to go
with your bitch ass,

39:47.218 --> 39:48.519
{\an1}you (bleep)
crater-faced bitch.

39:48.586 --> 39:49.854
Oh, craters in my--

39:49.920 --> 39:52.957
{\an1}I hope your nose falls off,
you (bleep) bitch.

39:53.023 --> 39:54.425
These are my...

39:54.492 --> 39:55.693
(Bleep) you.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.862
{\an1}I hope you mother(bleep)
die tomorrow.

39:57.928 --> 39:59.196
(Bleep) that ho.

39:59.263 --> 40:00.464
{\an1}I don't give a (bleep)
about that bitch.

40:00.531 --> 40:02.600
Rest in peace,
Teairra Mari.

40:02.666 --> 40:03.601
{\an3}Goodbye!

40:08.572 --> 40:10.741
{\an8}(man)
Next time on "Love &amp; Hip-Hop:
Hollywood"...

40:10.808 --> 40:12.376
{\an7}So what's going on
with you and Princess?

40:12.443 --> 40:14.845
{\an7}We love each other to death,
and that's what I'm scared of.

40:14.912 --> 40:16.847
{\an7}It might be meant to be, man,
I'm just saying.

40:16.914 --> 40:18.282
{\an8}Give love a shot, bro.

40:18.349 --> 40:21.051
{\an8}I would like you to be the
feature girl in my video.

40:21.118 --> 40:22.353
{\an9}What?

40:22.419 --> 40:24.421
{\an8}I still love you,
I will always love you.

40:24.488 --> 40:26.123
{\an8}I just wanted
to know, like,

40:26.190 --> 40:30.060
{\an8}do those thoughts
ever cross your mind?

40:32.062 --> 40:34.198
{\an8}We've been together
in the fashion show.

40:34.265 --> 40:36.867
{\an7}Through the back
walks in Princess.

40:36.934 --> 40:38.235
{\an8}Revenge plot?

40:38.302 --> 40:40.404
{\an8}And that's what I'm thinking.

40:38.302 --> 40:40.404
{\an8}So what are we gonna do?

40:40.471 --> 40:42.439
{\an7}I haven't decided
that part yet.

40:42.506 --> 40:43.774
{\an8}Oh, wait a minute!

40:43.841 --> 40:45.209
{\an8}Somebody's crashing the runway!

40:45.276 --> 40:48.145
{\an7}What's going on here, people?
What's going on?

40:48.212 --> 40:49.947
{\an8}Oh, we up in this bitch.

40:50.014 --> 40:51.549
{\an8}Get that polyester bull(bleep)
out of here.

40:51.615 --> 40:53.017
{\an8}Girl, shut
the (bleep) up!

40:53.083 --> 40:54.752
{\an8}When you attacked my friend...

40:54.819 --> 40:55.920
{\an8}I don't give a (bleep), bitch.

40:55.986 --> 40:58.489
{\an7}...would defend any of
your friends, so--

40:58.556 --> 41:01.225
{\an7}Did you throw a drink on me,
bitch (bleep)?

41:01.292 --> 41:03.060
{\an8}Don't start, Princess.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.060
{\an9}Try me.
