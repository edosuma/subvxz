Face it, Franny,
you've got a brown thumb...

00:10.010 --> 00:12.403
and not the sexy kind.

00:12.403 --> 00:14.840
I can't even raise a tomato.

Another out-of-focus photo
of scallops?

02:07.562 --> 02:10.173
Man, that woman loves scallops.

02:10.173 --> 02:12.871
And I love that she's still
sticking with that hairstyle.

02:12.871 --> 02:14.482

02:16.092 --> 02:17.224
Who are you guys
talking about?

02:17.224 --> 02:18.877
Bev DiVincenzo.

02:18.877 --> 02:20.531
Best social media
follow in the game.

02:20.531 --> 02:22.359
What makes her so great?

02:22.359 --> 02:24.883
She's a normal, sad person,
but she posts

02:24.883 --> 02:26.668
constantly
with the confidence of someone

02:26.668 --> 02:28.800
that has
an actually interesting life.

02:28.800 --> 02:31.716
Her life is so mundane
and yet so specific...

02:31.716 --> 02:32.978
it draws you in.

02:32.978 --> 02:34.719
She lives in Altoona, PA.

02:34.719 --> 02:36.939
She works out
at a non-judgmental gym.

02:36.939 --> 02:38.332
She loves
her Jeep Wrangler.

02:38.332 --> 02:40.116
She has a boyfriend
named Irv.

02:40.116 --> 02:42.553
Every Cinco de Mayo, she posts
a photo of her famous wet,

02:42.553 --> 02:44.555
watery homemade salsa.

02:44.555 --> 02:46.992
And her favorite nights are when
she's alone on her back patio

02:46.992 --> 02:48.690
with a cold bottle
of Diet Coke

02:48.690 --> 02:51.040
and the Pittsburgh Pirates
playing on her iPad.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.825
Oh! She just started using
the term YOLO.

02:53.825 --> 02:56.480
It's her new "sister
from another mister."

02:56.480 --> 02:57.742
If you guys love her
so much,

02:57.742 --> 02:59.353
why don't you go see her

02:59.353 --> 03:01.355
Altoona is only
three hours away.

03:01.355 --> 03:04.009
Hmm.
Premium content.

03:04.009 --> 03:06.229
I wouldn't be missed at work.
Bullock's using again.

03:06.229 --> 03:08.100
She would be
easy to find.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.233
Are you two really thinking
of driving three hours

03:10.233 --> 03:12.975
to stalk a total stranger
from Facebook?!

03:12.975 --> 03:14.759
That settles it.
We're doing it.

03:14.759 --> 03:15.891
Come on, Hayley!

03:15.891 --> 03:16.848
Yes!

03:18.067 --> 03:19.634
They both have diarrhea?

03:19.634 --> 03:20.852

03:20.852 --> 03:22.506

03:22.506 --> 03:23.681
Nice, Mom!

03:23.681 --> 03:26.118
Jesus, man. Calm down.

03:26.118 --> 03:28.382
I'm going to make
restaurant-quality food

03:28.382 --> 03:30.732
with them--
like they do at restaurants.

03:30.732 --> 03:34.605
I know a great recipe for truly
authentic Louisiana jambalaya

03:34.605 --> 03:36.825
I learned from
a blind bayou man.

03:36.825 --> 03:39.697
It was back in the 80's
during Mardi Gras...

03:39.697 --> 03:42.657
<i>I'd been drinking for 9
or 10 hours with no luck</i>

03:42.657 --> 03:44.920
<i>when a girl flashed
"F-me" eyes</i>

03:44.920 --> 03:47.052
<i>right as she walked out
the back door.</i>

03:49.664 --> 03:51.927
<i>I followed her down the alley
and then for miles...</i>

03:51.927 --> 03:54.669
<i>all the way out to the bayou.</i>

03:54.669 --> 03:56.671
<i>It was only there
I realized...</i>

03:56.671 --> 03:58.586
<i>she was a raccoon.</i>

04:00.675 --> 04:04.026
<i>A male raccoon, and he had
led me into a trap.</i>

04:04.026 --> 04:05.984
<i>I was a goner.</i>

04:05.984 --> 04:09.640
<i>But then out of nowhere
a blind bayou man saved me!</i>

04:09.640 --> 04:12.077
<i>He took me back to his shack
and prepared me</i>

04:12.077 --> 04:14.036
<i>life-nourishing jambalaya,</i>

04:14.036 --> 04:16.081
<i>teaching me the recipe
along the way.</i>

04:16.081 --> 04:19.084
Hold up, you were trying
to bone a raccoon?

04:19.084 --> 04:20.303
Is-- Is that
what you're saying?

04:20.303 --> 04:21.652
Steve,
you're totally missing

04:21.652 --> 04:23.785
one of the two points
of my story.

04:23.785 --> 04:26.396
I know how to make
truly authentic jambalaya

04:26.396 --> 04:28.746
as taught to me
by a blind bayou man!

04:28.746 --> 04:29.921
Count me out!

04:29.921 --> 04:31.532
I'm on a deadline.

04:31.532 --> 04:33.577
I didn't know you had
a new project, Klaus.

04:33.577 --> 04:37.364
Yeah, I'm writing a new
blockbuster movie for John Cena,

04:37.364 --> 04:39.409
but I only have
four days to do it.

04:39.409 --> 04:40.976
That's when he has
a book signing

04:40.976 --> 04:42.760
at the Langley Book Hole.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.632
I'm going to present him
with the script

04:44.632 --> 04:46.373
and convince him
to be in it.

04:46.373 --> 04:48.070
I love John Cena!

04:48.070 --> 04:49.550
I didn't know
he was an author.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.856
Oh, yeah, great author.

04:51.856 --> 04:53.945
I'm actually
slowly working my way

04:53.945 --> 04:57.340
through his new one right now
because I don't want it to end!

04:57.340 --> 05:00.169
Well, [bleep] jambalaya.
Can I help with your script?

05:00.169 --> 05:01.953
Are you serious?!

05:01.953 --> 05:03.433
I was a huge fan of the porno

05:03.433 --> 05:05.435
you and Roger wrote
back in Season 4.

05:05.435 --> 05:06.871
All right!

05:06.871 --> 05:08.786
You're getting in
at the right time too,

05:08.786 --> 05:11.180
I'm at
the top of page one.

05:11.180 --> 05:15.010
Well, I'm glad you're excited
to cook my veggies, Roger!

05:15.010 --> 05:17.360
Only problem is I'm having
a little trouble

05:17.360 --> 05:18.970
remembering that recipe.

05:18.970 --> 05:21.364
Well, I was originally
thinking of cooking--

05:21.364 --> 05:22.974
I know
how I can remember!

05:22.974 --> 05:25.237
You know how in college
if you go to class drunk

05:25.237 --> 05:27.370
and then take the final drunk
you remember everything

05:27.370 --> 05:29.241
- and ace it?
- No.

05:29.241 --> 05:32.201
I just have to get back to that
exact same drunk headspace

05:32.201 --> 05:34.638
I was in in that bayou
in '86.

05:34.638 --> 05:37.162
Honestly, Roger,
if-- if you can't remember--

05:37.162 --> 05:39.208
No, no, I can get there.

05:42.994 --> 05:45.257
Do you remember the recipe?!

05:45.257 --> 05:46.650
Roger, you're pissing

05:46.650 --> 05:47.695
in my colander.

05:50.393 --> 05:53.918
I can't believe we're in
the same town as Bev DiVincenzo!

05:53.918 --> 05:55.572
There's
Suzie's Meal Box!

05:55.572 --> 05:58.183
The best chicken Caesar salad
in the world!

05:58.183 --> 05:59.924
There's her
non-judgmental gym!

05:59.924 --> 06:01.448
Oh, my God, it's Bev!
It's Bev!

06:13.460 --> 06:14.722
Roger!

06:16.941 --> 06:19.422
Roger!
You destroyed my garden!

06:21.685 --> 06:24.949
I remember the jambalaya recipe!

06:27.212 --> 06:30.607
In walks the lead,
Brevin Docent...

06:30.607 --> 06:33.088
Whoa! Sick name!

06:33.088 --> 06:36.526
We gotta give him
a deep character.

06:36.526 --> 06:40.922
Women want to sleep with him
and guys wanna sleep with him.

06:40.922 --> 06:42.532
Yes.

06:42.532 --> 06:45.883
His ass looks hard
but also soft.

06:45.883 --> 06:50.018
His eyes are two rhinestones
in a bowl of heavy cream.

06:50.018 --> 06:52.020
He's a guy you want
to have a beer with,

06:52.020 --> 06:53.935
but when
he's having a beer...

06:53.935 --> 06:56.328
he's doing nuclear physics
in a notebook.

06:56.328 --> 06:58.069
Yes!

06:58.069 --> 07:00.332
He fosters sick cats
and makes girls climax

07:00.332 --> 07:02.334
like 18 times a night!

07:02.334 --> 07:04.119
Klaus!

07:04.119 --> 07:07.078
This is really good.

07:09.472 --> 07:11.256
Oh, my God,
Francine there you are!

07:11.256 --> 07:12.823
I figured it all out--

07:12.823 --> 07:15.043
how we can raise funds
to fix your garden.

07:15.043 --> 07:17.219
I wasn't really worried
about the money part.

07:17.219 --> 07:19.482
The answer was right
in front of us the whole time!

07:19.482 --> 07:21.441
Jambalaya!

07:21.441 --> 07:23.355
We'll use a portion of the
profits from the restaurant

07:23.355 --> 07:24.400
to fix your garden!

07:24.400 --> 07:25.967
What restaurant?!

07:25.967 --> 07:28.273
The jambalaya restaurant!

07:28.273 --> 07:30.798
That's what all the veggies
and seafood are for, silly!

07:32.060 --> 07:33.757
- I don't wanna--
- Holy crap!

07:33.757 --> 07:35.411
Look what was
in the shrimp!

07:35.411 --> 07:37.282
It's a frozen alligator!

07:37.282 --> 07:40.677
I wonder if it was frozen alive
like <i>Encino Man?</i>

07:40.677 --> 07:43.767
What if this is an <i>Encino Man</i>
situation, Francine?

07:43.767 --> 07:44.986
We better defrost it.

07:48.119 --> 07:50.470
I think that's the new front
of the restaurant!

07:50.470 --> 07:52.254
New what of the huh?

07:55.170 --> 07:57.825
You order
the old bayou porch?

07:57.825 --> 07:59.609
Where you want it?

08:03.526 --> 08:06.007
That'll work. Right?

08:06.007 --> 08:08.052
Roger, that's where
my garden was!

08:08.052 --> 08:09.140
She had a garden.

08:09.140 --> 08:10.925
Now we have a restaurant!

08:13.144 --> 08:15.582
Oh, my God!
He's alive!

08:15.582 --> 08:16.887
I'm gonna name him
Julius!

08:16.887 --> 08:18.498
Doesn't he look
like a Julius?

08:18.498 --> 08:19.977
I don't know, Roger.

08:19.977 --> 08:22.893
I don't know
what a Julius looks like.

08:22.893 --> 08:24.939
All I can picture
is a little Roman guy

08:24.939 --> 08:27.637
or a Philadelphia 76er.

08:30.379 --> 08:33.730
Roger, I don't want you running
a restaurant out of the house!

08:33.730 --> 08:35.863
You're the one who wanted
to open a restaurant.

08:35.863 --> 08:39.954
No. I said I wanted to make
a "restaurant-quality" dish

08:39.954 --> 08:41.869
with vegetables
from my garden.

08:41.869 --> 08:44.611
Oh, my God, enough about
your dumb garden!

08:44.611 --> 08:46.351
It was covered
in throw-up!

08:46.351 --> 08:48.528
And anyway, it's too late
because I sent Rogu

08:48.528 --> 08:50.094
to the wharf
with a bunch of flyers,

08:50.094 --> 08:52.967
and his cute ass
always pulls in business.

08:52.967 --> 08:55.360
So that's it?
The house is now a restaurant?!

08:55.360 --> 08:57.580
Whoa! Francine!
Your tone!

08:57.580 --> 08:59.321
It's upsetting Julius!

08:59.321 --> 09:01.628
God, he's soft.

09:01.628 --> 09:03.412
You should feel
how soft he-- Aah!

09:03.412 --> 09:05.457
He keeps me quick.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.373
Stan's going to kill us both

09:08.373 --> 09:11.072
if he comes back to a restaurant
in his living room!

09:11.072 --> 09:14.075
You're always so worried
about what Stan thinks.

09:14.075 --> 09:16.381
I'm starting to think
you like him.

09:16.381 --> 09:18.296
Maybe even more
than the restaurant.

09:18.296 --> 09:21.082
Much more! Because I don't like
the restaurant at all!

09:21.082 --> 09:23.432
And there it is.

09:23.432 --> 09:25.347
You were right, Julius.

09:25.347 --> 09:27.523
I hate to do this, but Julius
and I have been talking

09:27.523 --> 09:30.091
and we don't think you're
dedicated to the restaurant.

09:30.091 --> 09:31.832
I have to fire you.

09:31.832 --> 09:35.009
You are no longer an employee
of Julius's Bayou Bistro.

09:35.009 --> 09:38.621
I was never an employee
of Julius's Bayou Bistro!

09:38.621 --> 09:40.318
And that's a dumb name!

09:40.318 --> 09:42.016
Too far!

09:42.016 --> 09:43.626
Just get your stuff
and go.

09:43.626 --> 09:45.628
This is my stuff!

09:45.628 --> 09:48.631
This is all my stuff!

09:56.639 --> 09:58.685
Where are we?

09:58.685 --> 10:01.209
Oh, my God.

10:01.209 --> 10:03.515
You guys had
quite the crash.

10:03.515 --> 10:07.824
Lucky I was driving by. Local
hospital's a bunch of dipshits.

10:07.824 --> 10:09.347
I'll get you
back on your feet.

10:09.347 --> 10:11.088
I'm Bev DiVincenzo.

10:12.481 --> 10:14.265
I'm just glad you guys
didn't die.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.310
You know what they say...

10:15.310 --> 10:16.703
YOLO.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.843
Rogu, everyone's ready
and you haven't plated

10:26.843 --> 10:28.845
a single bowl
of jambalaya?!

10:28.845 --> 10:31.282
Rogu in weeds.

10:31.282 --> 10:33.502
I'm starting to think all that
restaurant experience

10:33.502 --> 10:35.112
on your application
was a lie.

10:35.112 --> 10:38.072
You wrote Rogu résumé.

10:38.072 --> 10:39.551
You got me there.

10:39.551 --> 10:41.945
Well, at least we can count
on Julius.

10:41.945 --> 10:44.861
Perfect. As always.

10:44.861 --> 10:46.689
Whoa!

10:46.689 --> 10:48.430
And as soon as Rogu is ready
with the jambalaya--

10:48.430 --> 10:50.040
Ready.

10:50.040 --> 10:53.217
Now I just don't know
what to believe, Rogu.

10:53.217 --> 10:54.958
Showtime!

10:54.958 --> 10:59.789
<i>♪ Jambalaya</i>

10:59.789 --> 11:01.051

And now it is my pleasure
to introduce

11:12.628 --> 11:14.848
the beating heart
of this restaurant.

11:14.848 --> 11:17.589
His name is on the front
for a reason...

11:17.589 --> 11:19.374
Julius!

11:19.374 --> 11:22.116
'Scuse me.
Sorry, did not rehearse this.

11:22.116 --> 11:23.334
Whoa!

11:23.334 --> 11:24.684
Hope someone brought
two figs in a coin-purse

11:24.684 --> 11:26.033
'cause that's
what I just felt!

11:26.033 --> 11:28.992
Ow, my shin! Oh, Jesus!

11:28.992 --> 11:31.212
That one stopped me
dead in my tracks.

11:31.212 --> 11:32.866
Ah!

11:32.866 --> 11:35.782
Got it.
Just give me a second.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.261
Okay, I'm good.

11:37.261 --> 11:39.176
Julius!

11:40.656 --> 11:42.789
And feel how soft he is!

11:46.009 --> 11:49.883
Yay! Three cheers for Julius
and his great restaurant!

11:49.883 --> 11:51.885
Hooray for Julius!

11:51.885 --> 11:55.279
That's the softest alligator
I've ever felt.

11:55.279 --> 11:56.846
How much would you...

11:56.846 --> 11:58.500
sell him for?

11:58.500 --> 11:59.501
For Julius?!

11:59.501 --> 12:00.720
Never, creep!

12:00.720 --> 12:03.766
Everything has a price.

12:03.766 --> 12:08.162
I would be buying him for only
good purposes, of course.

12:08.162 --> 12:10.207
Hm.

12:10.207 --> 12:12.122
Hey,
you're a real weirdo.

12:12.122 --> 12:13.558
Outta here, buddy.

12:13.558 --> 12:15.604
If you change your mind,
you can find me

12:15.604 --> 12:19.826
at the big, scary animal-wallet
factory at the edge of town!

12:19.826 --> 12:21.436
Now, who's ready

12:21.436 --> 12:23.394
for more jambalaya?!

12:25.962 --> 12:28.312
Now who's ready
for <i>Avatar 2?</i>

12:30.140 --> 12:31.533
I can't hear you!

12:31.533 --> 12:34.623
This is James [bleep] Cameron!

12:34.623 --> 12:38.801
Just like always, all I wanted
to do was cook my vegetables

12:38.801 --> 12:40.934
and now Roger's
running a restaurant

12:40.934 --> 12:43.501
out of our living room
with his new pet alligator--

12:43.501 --> 12:45.155
Julius.

12:45.155 --> 12:47.984
God, I'd love to see
Roger's face

12:47.984 --> 12:50.421
if something ever happened
to stupid Julius.

12:50.421 --> 12:52.032
That's it!

12:52.032 --> 12:54.208
I'm gonna make something
happen to stupid Julius!

12:54.208 --> 12:56.253
Oh, my God,
will you shut up?!

12:56.253 --> 12:58.342
You've been ranting
for hours!

12:58.342 --> 13:01.084
I'm not stopping you from
writing your dumb script,

13:01.084 --> 13:02.216
be my guest!

13:02.216 --> 13:05.132
Okay, Steve,
it's the climax.

13:05.132 --> 13:06.742
The bad guys
still have the kid.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.790
What if the hero
skydives in?

13:10.790 --> 13:14.532
The bad guys, stunned by how
beautiful and cool Brevin Docent

13:14.532 --> 13:17.579
played by John Cena is,
simply stand there...

13:17.579 --> 13:20.060
and he mows them all down
with a machine gun.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.975
Holy cow...

13:21.975 --> 13:23.846
They just stare at him
as he shoots them?

13:23.846 --> 13:24.934
That's stupid.

13:24.934 --> 13:26.675
Get her out of here!

13:26.675 --> 13:29.373
- Mom!
- Fine, whatever.

13:29.373 --> 13:30.461
This room sucks!

13:30.461 --> 13:32.072
Your story sucks!

13:32.072 --> 13:34.857
She's a hater, Steve!
She's a hater!

13:36.728 --> 13:39.470
But...
what if she's right?

13:42.343 --> 13:45.128
Well, sounds like you'll be
playing basketball again

13:45.128 --> 13:45.999
in no time.

13:47.914 --> 13:49.524
Hey! What are you doing
telling Bev

13:49.524 --> 13:50.830
your legs
are feeling better?

13:50.830 --> 13:51.918
They are.
Why wouldn't I?

13:51.918 --> 13:53.267
Because as soon as
we're okay,

13:53.267 --> 13:54.877
Bev will kick us out.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.400
And we can't leave
until we witness

13:56.400 --> 13:58.620
her vacuum pack
her winter clothes.

13:58.620 --> 13:59.839
Your legs are okay?

14:04.713 --> 14:06.149
Don't ruin this for me.

14:06.149 --> 14:07.847
Hey, Bev,
you wouldn't happen

14:07.847 --> 14:10.327
to have any homemade
salsa, would you?

14:10.327 --> 14:12.852
No, I only make that
on Cinco de Mayo.

14:15.028 --> 14:17.769
But...
I guess I could make some now.

14:19.249 --> 14:21.686
Also, I was thinking maybe
a little fresh air

14:21.686 --> 14:22.992
would do us good.

14:22.992 --> 14:24.733
I see you have a patio.

14:24.733 --> 14:26.039
Yeah, we can
sit out there tonight.

14:27.692 --> 14:32.219
Oh, darn, I was hoping
to watch the Pirates game.

14:32.219 --> 14:34.699
You guys didn't tell me
you were Pirates fans!

14:34.699 --> 14:36.440
I have an iPad
we can watch it on.

14:42.446 --> 14:45.014
<i>♪ Jambalaya, whoa</i>

14:45.014 --> 14:46.711

14:46.711 --> 14:48.191
Now it's time to meet

14:48.191 --> 14:50.324
the beating heart
of this restaurant.

14:50.324 --> 14:52.892
His name is on the front
for a reason...

14:52.892 --> 14:54.110
Julius!

14:59.028 --> 15:00.508
Feel how soft he--

15:00.508 --> 15:01.944
What the hell?

15:03.163 --> 15:05.948
Jambalaya?
But where's Julius?

15:05.948 --> 15:08.472
Someone knock out Rogu.

15:08.472 --> 15:10.866
Almost die.

15:10.866 --> 15:12.563
Julius has been stolen!

15:14.435 --> 15:16.524
It's printing!
We should have just enough time

15:16.524 --> 15:17.960
to get to the bookstore!

15:17.960 --> 15:19.570
So did you guys
change your ending?

15:19.570 --> 15:21.572
I swear to God,
Francine--

15:21.572 --> 15:22.617
Somebody took Julius!

15:22.617 --> 15:24.271
Julius is missing!

15:24.271 --> 15:26.838
Yo, bro, you got soup
on our script!

15:26.838 --> 15:29.624
Soup on your script?!
Julius is missing!

15:29.624 --> 15:32.453
Now maybe you know
what it feels like

15:32.453 --> 15:34.890
when someone takes something
you care about.

15:34.890 --> 15:37.414
Francine, did you have
something to do

15:37.414 --> 15:38.981
with Julius's
disappearance?

15:38.981 --> 15:40.461
Yes!

15:40.461 --> 15:42.811
I was gonna throw him
in Greg's pool,

15:42.811 --> 15:45.118
but luckily a creepy guy
lurking in our bushes

15:45.118 --> 15:47.555
- offered to do it for me.
- Oh, no!

15:47.555 --> 15:49.774
He's connected to that
animal-wallet factory!

15:49.774 --> 15:52.081
Animal-wallet factory?

15:52.081 --> 15:55.519
Can you guys please
take this anywhere else?!

15:55.519 --> 15:58.044
Where would an animal
even put their wallet?

15:58.044 --> 16:00.089
I mean,
a kangaroo I understand.

16:03.092 --> 16:04.746
Ohh.

16:04.746 --> 16:06.008
Oh, no!

16:06.008 --> 16:07.792
You gotta believe me, Roger.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.534
I didn't know I was
putting Julius in danger.

16:10.534 --> 16:12.275
Just forget it, Francine.

16:12.275 --> 16:14.016
All I want right now
is to walk into that building

16:14.016 --> 16:16.845
and walk out with Julius
safely intact...

16:16.845 --> 16:18.978
and a brand-new wallet
made from an animal

16:18.978 --> 16:21.023
I have
no emotional attachments to.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.720
Like a famous show dog
or something.

16:22.720 --> 16:23.591
I don't know.
Come on.

16:25.201 --> 16:27.421
Ohohoho.

16:27.421 --> 16:30.815
He's so soft.

16:30.815 --> 16:32.382
Skin him.

16:33.688 --> 16:35.211
No!

16:35.211 --> 16:37.344
Get them!

16:37.344 --> 16:38.867
We need a plan!

16:38.867 --> 16:39.999
I meant to bring that up
in the car.

16:44.612 --> 16:48.355
In that moment, Elbow Grease
realized it would take more

16:48.355 --> 16:51.575
than all-wheel drive
to get over the bridge.

16:51.575 --> 16:53.055
It would take love.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.536
Wait, he writes
children's books?

16:55.536 --> 16:57.842
Didn't you say you were slowly
working your way through one?

16:57.842 --> 16:59.931
They're good books!

16:59.931 --> 17:02.499
The main guy
is a determined truck!

17:02.499 --> 17:05.459
Hell yeah!
That's a book, bro!

17:05.459 --> 17:07.548
That's a book!

17:07.548 --> 17:09.463
Come on.
We have a script to sell.

17:09.463 --> 17:13.075
And act tough.
John Cena can smell fear.

17:15.686 --> 17:18.080
Hey, you need to be careful.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.126
Bev seemed a little unsettled
when you asked her

17:20.126 --> 17:22.519
to make the macaroni salad
she made for her aunt's funeral.

17:22.519 --> 17:26.001
I said "would make
for an aunt's funeral."

17:26.001 --> 17:28.917
All right,
a little mac salad.

17:28.917 --> 17:30.484
How bad
my Pirates losing?

17:30.484 --> 17:33.139
Excellent, also any chance
we can get a little more

17:33.139 --> 17:35.228
of this amazing, wet,
watery salsa?

17:35.228 --> 17:37.230
Sure.

17:37.230 --> 17:39.058
I need to go in and call
my boyfriend Irv, anyway.

17:42.365 --> 17:43.714
Irv...

17:43.714 --> 17:44.889
She's too good for Irv.

17:44.889 --> 17:46.848
She should date that guy
from her office.

17:46.848 --> 17:49.111
The one she gives the big donut
to every year on his birthday.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.678
- Mark Matthews?
- Mark Matthews!

17:50.678 --> 17:52.288
Her work husband!

17:52.288 --> 17:54.160
She's always posting about
how it's not sexual,

17:54.160 --> 17:55.900
but I think
they could get there.

17:55.900 --> 17:58.860
How do you know Mark Matthews?
What's going on?

17:58.860 --> 18:01.254
You guys have been saying
lots of weird stuff.

18:07.129 --> 18:10.306
We'll always love you!
Please don't block us!

18:12.961 --> 18:15.833
So you figured out
we were making drugs.

18:15.833 --> 18:19.228
What?! No, honestly, we were
just here for Julius!

18:19.228 --> 18:22.318
So you aren't here to take down
my huge cocaine operation?

18:23.667 --> 18:26.235
Wow, that's a ton of cocaine.

18:26.235 --> 18:27.889
Well, now
you've definitely seen it,

18:27.889 --> 18:30.544
so I still
have to kill you.

18:30.544 --> 18:35.157
It's funny, I was just saying
I bet the only thing softer

18:35.157 --> 18:38.813
than an alligator wallet
would be a human one.

18:38.813 --> 18:40.815
And now
I get to find out.

18:43.774 --> 18:46.299
If you had just
let me cook my vegetables,

18:46.299 --> 18:48.083
none of this
would be happening.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.085
But then we never
would've met Julius.

18:50.085 --> 18:51.826
Wouldn't you rather die
with Julius

18:51.826 --> 18:53.958
- than have never met him?
- No!

18:55.438 --> 18:58.311
Aah! Julius look away!

18:58.311 --> 19:00.748
What the hell is that?

19:02.967 --> 19:04.882
Whoa.

19:04.882 --> 19:07.798
His eyes are like
two rhinestones...

19:07.798 --> 19:10.758
In a bowl of heavy cream!

19:13.152 --> 19:14.196
- Aah!
- Aah!

19:14.196 --> 19:15.458
- Ugh!
- Oh!

19:21.203 --> 19:24.380
Whoo! Who thinks this
is stupid now, Francine?

19:26.208 --> 19:29.080
How'd you get John Cena
to save us?

19:29.080 --> 19:31.213
He saw the jambalaya stain
on our script

19:31.213 --> 19:32.693
and asked how it happened!

19:32.693 --> 19:34.608
Oh, when Stu
and Klaude told me

19:34.608 --> 19:37.045
you had a missing alligator,
I had to help.

19:37.045 --> 19:39.265
See,
I once had a pet alligator.

19:39.265 --> 19:42.659
Well, actually...
he was more of a best friend.

19:42.659 --> 19:45.009
But I lost him while scouting
a shrimp factory

19:45.009 --> 19:46.968
for a new Elbow Grease book.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.404
Wait...

19:48.404 --> 19:49.797
Julius?!

19:51.842 --> 19:54.802
It really is you!

19:54.802 --> 19:57.848
Wait a second.
He was your alligator?!

19:57.848 --> 20:00.242
And we both named him Julius?

20:00.242 --> 20:04.464
I guess he does
just look like a Julius.

20:04.464 --> 20:07.336
God, I miss Julius!

20:07.336 --> 20:11.079
Man, it really hurts when you
lose something you care about.

20:11.079 --> 20:13.081
It's almost like you
and your garden.

20:13.081 --> 20:16.040
Actually,
it's exactly like that.

20:16.040 --> 20:19.435
Francine, I think
I just learned a lesson.

20:19.435 --> 20:21.568
I know I learned one.
Trying to...

20:21.568 --> 20:25.354
Oh, look! The trailer for Julius
and John Cena's new movie is up!

20:25.354 --> 20:28.488
They stole the idea from Steve
and Klaus. Isn't that funny?

20:28.488 --> 20:30.141
<i>He's a nuclear physicist</i>

20:30.141 --> 20:31.926
<i>you'd wanna get a beer with...</i>

20:31.926 --> 20:35.538
