00:15.140 --> 00:18.226
<i>For Terry, every day,</i>
<i>means a new murder case,</i>

00:18.852 --> 00:21.771
<i>and a new celebrity guest star</i>
<i>as his partner.</i>

00:22.272 --> 00:26.443
<i>Today's guest:</i>
<i>comedy legend Conan O'Brien.</i>

00:26.943 --> 00:28.611
<i>But here's the catch.</i>

00:28.695 --> 00:30.822
<i>Conan isn't being given a script.</i>

00:30.905 --> 00:33.825
<i>He has no idea what's about to happen.</i>

00:34.325 --> 00:38.872
<i>Together, he and Terry will have</i>
<i>to improvise their way through the case.</i>

00:38.955 --> 00:42.042
<i>But it'll be up to Conan alone</i>
<i>to name the killer.</i>

00:42.834 --> 00:46.087
<i>So join them</i>
<i>as they punch a one-way ticket</i>

00:46.921 --> 00:48.631
<i>to Murderville.</i>

00:52.927 --> 00:54.095
<i>The big city.</i>

00:55.096 --> 00:57.557
<i>Where only the strong survive…</i>

00:57.640 --> 01:00.477
<i>And the ruthless… thrive.</i>

01:01.102 --> 01:02.937
<i>I just made that rhyme up.</i>

01:03.021 --> 01:06.399
<i>No big deal.</i>
<i>I can do all sorts of cool stuff.</i>

01:07.067 --> 01:09.736
<i>My name is Terry Seattle.</i>

01:09.819 --> 01:14.532
<i>I'm a senior homicide detective.</i>
<i>And I am killing it.</i>

01:14.616 --> 01:15.366
Detective.

01:20.371 --> 01:21.372
Morning, Chief.

01:21.456 --> 01:22.499
Pleasure to see you.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.667
Pleasure to see you.
I hope you're doing very well.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.295
I am doing very well. Thank you.

01:27.837 --> 01:30.381
You need to come past the house
and pick up the rest of your crap.

01:30.465 --> 01:33.384
That is not crap, Rhonda,
that's 17 years of marriage.

01:33.468 --> 01:37.096
It's a broken PlayStation 2,
some old <i>Maxim</i> magazines,

01:37.180 --> 01:40.016
a car wash receipt signed by Axl Rose

01:40.099 --> 01:42.310
and a "Take me drunk I'm home" t-shirt.

01:42.393 --> 01:44.771
If you had read
just one of those <i>Maxim</i> articles,

01:44.854 --> 01:46.064
you would know that as a modern male--

01:46.147 --> 01:48.274
Terry, come get your shit
or I'm throwing it out.

01:48.858 --> 01:49.901
Okay?

01:50.693 --> 01:51.653
Okay.

01:53.029 --> 01:56.574
Don't pout, Detective.
I've got a present for you.

01:57.492 --> 01:58.368
A new partner.

01:58.451 --> 02:01.663
No, you can't be serious. Come on,
my life's not going wrong enough as it is

02:01.746 --> 02:03.998
that I gotta babysit
some homicide trainee?

02:04.082 --> 02:06.960
Do you not remember what happened
when I babysat your nephew?

02:07.043 --> 02:09.045
Come on out, Conan.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.011
Come a little closer.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.599
I never liked to presume
how close I can get.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.059
That's just fine.

02:24.060 --> 02:27.730
Terry, meet your new partner,
Conan O'Brien.

02:28.231 --> 02:31.442
Conan, this is senior detective,
Terry Seattle.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.528
Good to see you, sir. How are you?

02:34.237 --> 02:36.197
Got quite a grip on you, huh?

02:38.366 --> 02:40.827
- Yeah.
- Good Lord.

02:48.334 --> 02:51.004
- Yes.
- Yeah, okay. Yeah.

02:51.087 --> 02:52.714
Put your fingers in your ears.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.050
Are you joking?

02:57.427 --> 03:01.097
I mean, did I just turn seven years old?
Because you hired a goddamn clown!

03:01.180 --> 03:03.600
You're the only detective
who can't keep a partner.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.143
Yeah, because they're all idiots!

03:05.226 --> 03:08.146
I mean, look at this guy with his fingers
in his ears. I mean, God!

03:08.229 --> 03:09.022
I can actually,

03:09.105 --> 03:11.900
the fingers don't actually block out
the sound that well,

03:11.983 --> 03:13.985
so I heard clown, I heard idiot.

03:14.068 --> 03:15.653
Terry, make it work.

03:16.404 --> 03:17.655
Nice to meet you.

03:17.739 --> 03:18.823
Let me tell you something.

03:18.907 --> 03:22.911
This ginger monstrosity is the biggest
mistake in the history of city homicide!

03:23.995 --> 03:24.746
No offense.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.414
None taken.

03:26.497 --> 03:27.665
You seem very nervous.

03:27.749 --> 03:31.127
It's my first day on the job
and you're a bit of a legend, so.

03:31.794 --> 03:33.546
It's Terry Seattle. Is that it?

03:33.630 --> 03:37.300
You do more bowing
than a goddamn Tommy Tune.

03:37.383 --> 03:40.678
Okay, bit of an outdated reference
if you ask me, but--

03:41.346 --> 03:42.388
Follow me.

03:52.815 --> 03:54.609
- It's a great office you have here.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.402
Talker.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.196
Yeah. Okay.

03:58.696 --> 04:02.283
Senior detective, Terry Seattle.
And no, I've never been.

04:03.409 --> 04:04.577
That was gonna be my first question.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.037
- Of course it was.
- Yeah.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.538
I got married in Seattle.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.290
What?

04:09.374 --> 04:10.792
I got married in Seattle.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.835
No, I mean, you got married?

04:13.586 --> 04:14.337
Yeah.

04:14.837 --> 04:15.713
To what?

04:16.464 --> 04:17.799
To a wonderful woman.

04:18.675 --> 04:19.842
Does she know?

04:19.926 --> 04:20.760
Uh…

04:21.302 --> 04:23.388
She has an idea.
Let's just put it that way.

04:23.471 --> 04:24.138
Listen,

04:24.222 --> 04:25.932
I hope you don't take this personal,

04:26.015 --> 04:29.602
but I'm not really looking
for a new partner. I already had the best.

04:29.686 --> 04:33.314
Her name was Lori Griffin.
And she was murdered 15 years ago.

04:34.107 --> 04:34.732
Oh…

04:34.816 --> 04:37.318
And out of respect for Lori Griffin,

04:38.069 --> 04:40.697
her desk has remained
completely untouched.

04:41.239 --> 04:42.282
Since that night.

04:42.782 --> 04:45.201
Everything is the same, just the way
she left it. Her case notes,

04:45.785 --> 04:47.287
her uneaten breakfast burrito,

04:47.370 --> 04:50.665
her pet rabbit, Gulliver.
God, I miss that little guy.

04:50.748 --> 04:53.751
You know, you can feed those things
even after the owner's gone.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.129
It would not be respectful to touch it.

04:56.212 --> 04:58.506
Just feed and water them,
a rabbit can live--

04:58.589 --> 04:59.841
Disrespectful.

04:59.924 --> 05:00.717
40 years.

05:00.800 --> 05:01.801
Disrespectful.

05:01.884 --> 05:04.262
What'd you do prior to this,

05:04.345 --> 05:07.473
before you decided to become a homicide
detective? What kind of work were you in?

05:07.557 --> 05:10.643
Been a lot of things.
An entertainer for a while. I, uh--

05:10.727 --> 05:13.021
Yeah. Well, listen,
none of that matters now. Nobody cares.

05:13.104 --> 05:15.523
- Well, you just asked.
- No, but none of it matters.

05:15.606 --> 05:18.318
City homicide
isn't for precious little man-boys

05:18.401 --> 05:21.696
who are afraid to get their lips dirty
and their pants wet. Okay?

05:21.779 --> 05:23.197
No, I wouldn't think so.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.491
'Cause you don't know anything
about getting your lips dirty, do you?

05:25.575 --> 05:27.535
You probably keep your lips real clean.

05:27.618 --> 05:29.787
I can get these lips
as dirty as you want them to be.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.040
Just covered in all kinds of stuff.

05:32.123 --> 05:34.208
City homicide, we're bad dudes.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.544
I'm a bad dude. Are you a bad dude?

05:36.627 --> 05:37.503
Listen,

05:37.587 --> 05:39.380
you are a bad mofo. Everyone knows it.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.883
And I want to get in there. I want
to get my hands dirty, my lips dirty.

05:41.966 --> 05:44.510
I want to solve
whatever case comes our way.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.596
He's got the goods.

05:46.679 --> 05:50.975
He's got what it takes to be a hard-ass,
homicide detective trainee.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.978
Well, that's good news.
Because there's been a murder.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.146
What?

05:55.688 --> 05:59.400
A magician performing
at the grand opening of the city library

05:59.484 --> 06:01.778
sawed his assistant in half

06:01.861 --> 06:03.696
but couldn't put her back together again.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.365
Classic Humpty Dumpty.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.993
I need you two down there on the double.

06:10.620 --> 06:11.788
Goodbye, Chief.

06:12.371 --> 06:13.790
You ready to go solve this murder?

06:13.873 --> 06:15.458
I am. I'm ready to go.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.460
- Yeah, let's get going.
- All right.

06:18.336 --> 06:19.962
<i>We took my '82 Dodge Rampage</i>

06:20.046 --> 06:22.632
<i>over to the library to check out</i>
<i>the crime scene.</i>

06:23.257 --> 06:26.677
<i>It was time for Conan</i>
<i>to take off his training diaper</i>

06:26.761 --> 06:29.347
<i>and start pooping his pants</i>
<i>like a big boy.</i>

06:29.430 --> 06:31.933
Terry Seattle, Senior Detec--
Doesn't matter.

06:32.517 --> 06:35.728
You don't need to show--
we're in a crime scene, okay?

06:36.312 --> 06:39.107
I think we should find out
what the hell went on here.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.775
- Officers.
- Officers.

06:41.275 --> 06:42.777
I already said officers.

06:42.860 --> 06:43.653
Okay.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.116
Well, well, look at this guy.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.659
<i>Hola</i>, Seattle.

06:50.326 --> 06:51.577
You must be Terry's new partner.

06:51.661 --> 06:54.122
Yes. I'm his new partner, Conan O'Brien.
What's your name?

06:54.205 --> 06:56.833
Detective Darren Phillips.
Most people call me Daz.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.417
Nobody call-- I don't call you Daz at all.

06:58.501 --> 06:59.127
It's a pleasure.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.671
Detective Phillips, honor to see you.
What's going on?

07:01.754 --> 07:05.007
All right, stop schmoozing with this guy.
What's wrong? You're just embarrassing.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.426
Just tell him it's our crime scene
and get the hell out of here.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.304
Hey, this is our crime scene.
We're taking lead on this one.

07:10.388 --> 07:14.267
We understand
there's been a homicide murder.

07:14.892 --> 07:20.231
Uh, victim sawed in half during some kind
of magical performance, if you will.

07:20.314 --> 07:22.525
Why are you telling him? He's an officer.

07:22.608 --> 07:25.987
I'm reviewing the facts
of what I've heard so far.

07:26.070 --> 07:29.157
Let's continue.
Sir, please. How can we help?

07:29.240 --> 07:30.450
What do we got here?

07:30.533 --> 07:32.368
This gentleman is Captivating Keith.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.163
It was his assistant
who got sawed in half.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.957
I don't know what happened, man.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.877
My assistant, Sarah and me, we just--

07:40.960 --> 07:43.713
we did the same routine we've always done.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.673
Somebody must have gone in
and they must have

07:45.756 --> 07:48.759
replaced the trick saw with a real saw.

07:48.843 --> 07:53.055
The blood. There, there, blood.
It's just everywhere! Blood!

07:53.139 --> 07:56.642
Did you think at any point
when there was all that blood

07:56.726 --> 07:59.770
that maybe you should stop sawing?
Did that occur to you?

08:00.730 --> 08:01.397
Maybe.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.691
Did you have a safe word
that you normally employ?

08:03.774 --> 08:05.943
- Of course we had a safe word.
- Okay.

08:06.444 --> 08:09.322
If anything was to go wrong, my assistant
was supposed to shout, "Stop!"

08:09.405 --> 08:11.991
But all I heard was,
"Keith, you're sawing me in half."

08:13.242 --> 08:16.204
- I guess it's not the safe word.
- No, they're not the same.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.372
- Yeah, well… Really isn't.
- There's rules.

08:19.123 --> 08:20.750
We're sorry for your loss.

08:21.250 --> 08:22.001
Thank you.

08:22.919 --> 08:23.836
Amber.

08:23.920 --> 08:27.715
This is Amber Kang. Forensics.

08:28.633 --> 08:29.509
Nice to see you.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.594
- Wow, wow, wow.
- Uh…

08:31.677 --> 08:36.390
Homicide detective, Kang Coroner… Uh…

08:36.474 --> 08:37.850
- What…?
- What? I'm sorry.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.895
What are you doing?
You're embarrassing, you're so nerv--

08:40.978 --> 08:42.188
I got nervous.

08:42.271 --> 08:43.814
Amber, um…

08:43.898 --> 08:49.820
we'd like to know what's happening here.
State of the body… dead, I presume.

08:49.904 --> 08:50.738
Very dead.

08:50.821 --> 08:52.782
What've we got here, Amber?

08:52.865 --> 08:54.909
Let me take you over to the murder weapon.

08:54.992 --> 08:57.995
Now, here's something interesting.
No fingerprints.

08:58.496 --> 09:01.290
But, you'll never guess
what I did find on the handle.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.000
Traces of hot sauce.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.126
Wow!

09:04.210 --> 09:06.504
- Hot sauce on the handle.
- Spicy.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.423
The body is right there.

09:09.507 --> 09:11.217
And you're being a total clown.

09:11.717 --> 09:12.927
Now, just take it easy.

09:13.010 --> 09:17.431
Uh… traces of hot sauce. Were you able
to trace what kind of hot sauce?

09:17.515 --> 09:21.644
Not yet, but we also found
trace amounts of pet hair.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.813
Most likely a small animal.

09:24.397 --> 09:24.981
Interesting.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.941
What are you thinking?
Maybe a beagle out for revenge?

09:29.277 --> 09:30.528
Anything else, Amber?

09:30.611 --> 09:32.947
Well, did you take a look at the suitcase?

09:33.656 --> 09:36.576
Says this is where
Captivating Keith kept his trick saw.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.911
Now apparently,
he was the only one with a key

09:38.995 --> 09:42.456
so someone must have picked the lock,
switched the saws.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.292
Excuse me, Mr. Policeman.

09:44.959 --> 09:45.918
Yes?

09:46.544 --> 09:49.213
When is the magician
going to finish the trick?

09:49.297 --> 09:50.506
Uh…

09:51.257 --> 09:51.966
Well,

09:52.049 --> 09:54.135
I'm gonna look at some evidence

09:54.218 --> 09:56.429
and this tall, young gentleman here

09:56.512 --> 09:59.181
will be happy to answer
any of your questions.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.266
So…

10:01.225 --> 10:02.393
Hello, what's your name?

10:02.476 --> 10:05.479
When is the magician
going to put the lady back together?

10:06.063 --> 10:06.689
Well,

10:07.481 --> 10:09.942
the lady can't go back together

10:10.610 --> 10:12.153
because what happened,

10:12.236 --> 10:13.654
is the magician

10:13.738 --> 10:15.906
really sawed her in half,

10:15.990 --> 10:17.241
cut through skin,

10:17.325 --> 10:19.744
ligament, muscle, bone.

10:19.827 --> 10:23.372
She had instantaneous,
probably 90% blood loss

10:23.456 --> 10:25.666
and then she went into that black void

10:26.876 --> 10:28.002
known as death.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.171
Where there is no return.

10:30.671 --> 10:33.382
She's gone. Gone forever.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.968
What does that all even mean? I don't--

10:36.052 --> 10:36.969
She's dead.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.804
- I just don't understand--
- She's so dead.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.765
I just don't understand.
Is magic real or not?

10:40.848 --> 10:42.558
It's a very simple question, sir.
It's a yes or no!

10:42.642 --> 10:43.517
It's not magic.

10:43.601 --> 10:44.518
It is magic.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.103
- God.
- Look at the sign behind you.

10:46.604 --> 10:50.733
Yeah, I know.
That's what grown-ups call a lie.

10:50.816 --> 10:51.776
Is this what dying is?

10:51.859 --> 10:54.945
That's what I told you.
Yes, this is what dying is like.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.364
She'll go to heaven, right?

10:56.989 --> 10:58.407
Oh, well, I don't know.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.910
Will she still be in two pieces
when she's in heaven?

11:00.993 --> 11:04.705
Well, no, my guess is,
before they put her in the ground--

11:04.789 --> 11:07.041
All right, trainee, let's go.
We found some new evidence.

11:07.124 --> 11:09.251
Was on my knee for a long time.

11:09.752 --> 11:13.881
<i>Our first suspect was</i>
<i>Captivating Keith's former assistant, Deb.</i>

11:14.382 --> 11:16.258
<i>She'd recently been fired and replaced</i>

11:16.342 --> 11:19.720
<i>with the much younger</i>
<i>and now much deader, Sarah.</i>

11:21.764 --> 11:24.183
Welcome to Quirky Jack's Homestyle Eatery.

11:24.266 --> 11:27.770
Where we serve heaping portions of whimsy
and medium-sized portions of food.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.438
My name is Deb, I'll be your server.

11:29.522 --> 11:33.901
Can I start you off with a bowl
of our world-famous deep-fried chowder?

11:33.984 --> 11:36.195
We're not really hungry for food, Deb.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.365
We are hungry for answers.

11:39.990 --> 11:42.118
Is this about what happened to Sarah
at Keith's magic show?

11:42.201 --> 11:44.245
That's right.
It is about what happened to Sarah.

11:44.328 --> 11:46.997
Okay. Listen, I'll talk to you,
but you're gonna have to order something

11:47.081 --> 11:48.582
because otherwise
my boss is gonna get mad.

11:48.666 --> 11:49.750
Okay. Yeah, well, I could eat something.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.836
Sure, yeah. I'll have…

11:51.919 --> 11:53.879
Oh, you know what,
they got the sloppy jalapeñ-joes.

11:54.380 --> 11:57.174
They're back. Yeah, we'll take
two of those. The sloppy jalapeñ-joes.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.760
Do you want to add two sloparitas
for five bucks more?

11:59.844 --> 12:03.305
- Let's do it.
- Two, <i>dos,</i> sloparitas.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.932
- Yes.
- I'll be back with your food.

12:05.015 --> 12:07.226
You're gonna love
this sloppy jalapeñ-joes.

12:07.309 --> 12:09.728
You have never had a wetter sandwich.
It's unbelievable.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.272
All right.
Well, I'm looking forward to it.

12:11.355 --> 12:14.817
It's like eating throw up.
That's delicious.

12:16.026 --> 12:19.321
All right, we got two sloppy jalapeñ-joes.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.990
Yes, we sure do.

12:23.159 --> 12:26.203
And two sloparitas.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.247
Two sloparitas.

12:28.330 --> 12:33.294
This is good. And you gotta try
some of this signature spicy slop sauce.

12:33.794 --> 12:35.337
You know,
it just makes it extra sloppy.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.173
That is extremely hot…

12:37.256 --> 12:40.384
Yeah. That's good.
You have never had a sloppier sandwich.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.178
- Okay.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.388
- Get right into it, huh?
- Yup. Eat up.

12:44.472 --> 12:45.890
Yeah, I got other tables, so…

12:45.973 --> 12:48.559
Well, I don't have other murders. So.

12:48.642 --> 12:50.186
- God, it's wet.
- Okay.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.479
Yeah, okay.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.147
That is a sloppy sandwich.

12:56.650 --> 12:59.069
- I tried to warn you.
- Yeah.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.491
All right, you got some questions
in your notebook.

13:03.574 --> 13:05.493
Yeah, did you have questions for me?

13:06.285 --> 13:08.078
Go ahead. Shoot.
This is your time to shine.

13:08.162 --> 13:10.956
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey, we haven't got all day.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.666
Okay, I'm sorry.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.543
Wanna take another bite first?
Are you hungry?

13:15.878 --> 13:19.798
Let me get that sloppy for you.
You've never had a sloppy sandwich.

13:19.882 --> 13:22.051
- Well, this is great.
- Just slop it. Really slop it.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.094
No, it's great.
It's very aggressive on your part.

13:24.595 --> 13:25.596
Oh, my God.

13:29.683 --> 13:30.726
Go ahead.

13:34.772 --> 13:36.190
Dive in there, Conan.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.235
Is it true Captivating Keith

13:39.860 --> 13:43.405
replaced you with Sarah
'cause he thought you'd gotten too old?

13:48.285 --> 13:50.913
Jesus Christ, Conan.
What the hell's wrong with you?

13:50.996 --> 13:53.123
I spent the best years of my life

13:53.624 --> 13:56.794
getting shoved into boxes
and like, attacked

13:56.877 --> 13:58.254
by doves or very mean animals.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.340
For what? So I can be replaced

14:01.423 --> 14:04.426
by some 19-year-old with fake boobs

14:04.510 --> 14:07.638
who doesn't even know
how to pick a closed-shackle padlock.

14:07.721 --> 14:09.431
It's humiliating!

14:09.515 --> 14:10.641
Get in there! You're not--

14:10.724 --> 14:13.227
I don't know what you're talking about!
I'm eating everything!

14:13.310 --> 14:15.396
He's right.
You're not slopping the Joe.

14:16.397 --> 14:17.815
I wanna die.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.701
Another question for you.

14:28.784 --> 14:31.745
Is it safe to say
you held a grudge against Sarah?

14:31.829 --> 14:33.414
Duh! Wouldn't you?

14:35.791 --> 14:36.375
Probably.

14:36.458 --> 14:37.918
What's wrong with your face?

14:39.378 --> 14:40.379
I have high blood pressure.

14:40.462 --> 14:43.299
Is there anyone else
who might have wanted to hurt her?

14:44.717 --> 14:47.970
She used to be another
magician's assistant. Magic Melvin.

14:48.596 --> 14:49.430
Magic Melvin?

14:49.513 --> 14:54.101
Yeah. I heard they separated on bad terms,
so you could talk to him.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.227
You okay?

14:55.811 --> 14:57.146
Maybe you need to get in that sloppy--

14:57.229 --> 15:00.524
No, I can't. I honestly,
I have had so much of that right now.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.570
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- It's not gonna be okay!

15:04.653 --> 15:06.864
Dude, look at my life!

15:06.947 --> 15:10.326
No one wants to hire
a 40-year-old magician's assistant!

15:10.409 --> 15:11.160
Oh, please.

15:11.243 --> 15:12.995
I work in this crappy job.

15:13.078 --> 15:17.625
My clothes smell like steam meat.
My stupid boyfriend tried to cheer me up

15:17.708 --> 15:20.336
by buying me a puppy,
but I have allergies.

15:20.419 --> 15:24.048
So, I had to tell him,
"You can't keep that dog in my house."

15:24.131 --> 15:27.426
And then he said, "I can't talk right now,
Deb. I'm with my wife and kids."

15:27.509 --> 15:29.094
"And you know we have boundaries."

15:29.178 --> 15:32.473
So, now I have no choice
but to go over to his house

15:32.556 --> 15:34.975
and make a scene
in front of his entire family.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.268
I'll take this when you're ready.

15:37.686 --> 15:38.896
<i>Thanks to Deb's tip,</i>

15:38.979 --> 15:43.192
<i>we brought Captivating Keith's rival,</i>
<i>Magic Melvin, in for questioning.</i>

15:43.275 --> 15:46.528
<i>It was time for Conan and me</i>
<i>to take the gloves off.</i>

15:47.154 --> 15:49.615
We got a suspect.
We got this guy Melvin coming in.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.701
- We're gonna break this guy.
- Okay.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.161
We're gonna break his will.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.790
Want to do good cop bad cop?
Or should we just both be bad cop?

15:57.873 --> 15:59.667
I think two bad--
I think bad cop, bad cop.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.502
- Bad cop, worse cop.
- Yeah.

16:01.585 --> 16:02.461
Here we go.

16:02.544 --> 16:05.381
Can I get you anything?
Coffee, anything you need?

16:05.464 --> 16:07.591
Actually, yup, you know what,
I'll have a breakfast burrito.

16:07.675 --> 16:08.842
Uh, three eggs,

16:08.926 --> 16:10.678
soft scrambled, onions and peppers,

16:10.761 --> 16:13.180
Tabasco, salt, and pepper.

16:13.263 --> 16:14.848
And you know what my favorite trick is?

16:14.932 --> 16:16.767
Making that little thing
disappear every morning.

16:16.850 --> 16:20.312
Okay, no food for a murder suspect.

16:20.396 --> 16:21.647
Do you guys want anything?

16:21.730 --> 16:23.399
Get out of here, Hughes. You're the worst.

16:24.233 --> 16:27.611
Now, you listen to me, Melvin.
Grab a seat, O'Brien.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.577
God, that started off so cool.

16:35.661 --> 16:36.787
I know, I couldn't--

16:36.870 --> 16:38.455
You flipped it
and then you couldn't land it.

16:38.539 --> 16:41.250
No, I just--
I didn't think about it ahead of time.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.085
So, magic Melvin.

16:44.420 --> 16:45.462
Can you see me through the mirror?

16:45.546 --> 16:49.216
Oh, hi. I talk to my wife like this
when she's doing her makeup.

16:49.299 --> 16:51.635
- You got a lot of jokes, Melvin.
- Yeah, you got a lot of jokes.

16:51.719 --> 16:54.972
Well, you know, as a magician I do have
patter and I do like to have fun.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.098
Tell my partner a joke.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.892
Alright, so these two Jews walk into a--

16:58.976 --> 17:00.853
- Jews, okay, no. We're not cool with that.
- Okay, alright, we're not gonna do that.

17:00.936 --> 17:01.979
Do something else.

17:02.062 --> 17:05.232
Alright. So, four or five Jews--

17:05.315 --> 17:06.650
- No, no, no.
- You know what? No.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.068
No, listen up, Melvin.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.571
Do you know what happened
to your former assistant, Sarah, today?

17:10.654 --> 17:12.573
Yes, it's terrible.
It's a magician's worst nightmare.

17:12.656 --> 17:13.741
Unbelievable acting.

17:13.824 --> 17:16.201
You don't seem that busted up
about it and I wonder why?

17:16.285 --> 17:18.037
'Cause maybe
you had something to do with it!

17:18.120 --> 17:20.414
Detective, what are you accusing me of?

17:20.497 --> 17:23.625
A young woman was murdered
against her will today

17:23.709 --> 17:26.420
and if I find out that
you had anything to do with it,

17:27.004 --> 17:29.715
I swear to God, I will peel off your skin,

17:29.798 --> 17:32.801
eat it and then shit it out

17:32.885 --> 17:34.845
and use that excrement

17:34.928 --> 17:39.099
as fertilizer to grow a tree
from which I will one day hang you from.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.851
You're gonna die
and we're going to watch you,

17:40.934 --> 17:44.146
unless you tell us exactly,
exactly what happened!

17:44.229 --> 17:46.190
- What happened?
- What happened?

17:46.899 --> 17:51.153
Detectives,
I am as law-abiding as they come.

17:51.236 --> 17:52.488
I can give you an example.

17:52.571 --> 17:56.033
Whenever I find something
that's not mine, I always return it.

17:56.116 --> 17:58.702
Such as this quarter I just found

17:58.786 --> 18:00.913
- What the--?
- behind your ear!

18:00.996 --> 18:03.957
And wait! Oh, oh, my goodness.
Look at this, another one!

18:04.041 --> 18:04.958
Can you see that?

18:05.042 --> 18:06.502
Yeah, he's got it in his hand before…

18:06.585 --> 18:08.087
That's incredible!

18:08.170 --> 18:10.631
Quarters are very easy
to lose behind your ears

18:10.714 --> 18:11.882
- because they're small.
- 'cause they're small.

18:11.965 --> 18:15.010
But if I mix it up just a little bit.
You can hear it and I--

18:15.094 --> 18:16.220
blow it, look at this.

18:16.804 --> 18:21.517
And now it's a single half-dollar
fifty-cent piece.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.851
Make sure to put that in your piggy bank.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.937
- That is astounding.
- It's not.

18:25.020 --> 18:26.188
Holy shit.

18:26.271 --> 18:27.606
He's always got one in the other hand.

18:27.689 --> 18:30.025
My jaw is on the floor.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.693
Oh, well, then maybe
we should clean it up.

18:32.528 --> 18:35.572
- Actually, that was pretty cool.
- Let me just clean up the jaw.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.449
- I like that one.
- We don't need this thing anymore.

18:37.533 --> 18:41.537
So all we do a little pixie dust.
Rub it on here and--

18:41.620 --> 18:43.497
- I didn't see-- Okay, that was…
- No way!

18:43.580 --> 18:45.916
- That was insane. That was…
- That's what I'm talking about.

18:45.999 --> 18:48.836
- That was a solid B+ up-close trick.
- I got to be honest with you--

18:48.919 --> 18:51.547
I feel good, I feel like I'm good
with this suspect. There's nothing.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.507
No, I have questions.

18:53.590 --> 18:56.760
Can you tell us what happened
between you and your old assistant?

18:56.844 --> 18:58.720
Was there a falling out?

18:58.804 --> 19:00.639
- I can tell you the whole story.
- Okay.

19:00.722 --> 19:03.433
But first I just need some help from you.

19:03.517 --> 19:04.768
- Okay.
- If you don't mind.

19:04.852 --> 19:05.769
Anything ever.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.438
So, what I'd like you to do is,
here's a deck of cards.

19:08.522 --> 19:11.733
Don't they frisk people before they
bring them into this interrogation room?

19:12.359 --> 19:13.527
- Now.
- Okay.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.779
- I'll spread these out and I want you--
- Looks like a regular deck of cards.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.949
Please, detective,
to take any card you want.

19:19.032 --> 19:22.202
Any one, any card.
Don't let me influence you.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.246
Just choose one. Is that the one you want?
Do you want to change your mind?

19:24.329 --> 19:26.540
- Okay. I do want to change my mind.
- Very good.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.000
I'm gonna take this one here.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.793
We can be here all day. Thank you.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.129
I'd love to be here--
I mean, I could watch this all day.

19:32.212 --> 19:35.174
You've taken the card. Show it to your
partner, please. Do not show it to me.

19:35.257 --> 19:38.093
I'm looking away, I'm looking down.
Alright.

19:38.177 --> 19:41.180
And now I'd like you to put it back
anywhere you like in the deck.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.850
I'm going to watch this hands
this whole time. I'm gonna get this.

19:44.933 --> 19:46.101
Eye on him.

19:46.643 --> 19:49.271
And now, we're going to mix them up
real good. And I will tell you

19:49.354 --> 19:52.482
that Sarah was my assistant
for a few months

19:52.566 --> 19:55.068
and everything was going great.

19:55.152 --> 19:57.821
She'd been doing a terrific job
and then one day,

19:57.905 --> 20:00.199
she just didn't show up for work,

20:01.033 --> 20:03.577
and I thought it was strange.
And then the next week,

20:03.660 --> 20:07.706
I saw that she was working
for Captivating Keith

20:07.789 --> 20:09.791
and he was performing all my tricks!

20:09.875 --> 20:12.461
- She stole your tricks.
- She stole your act.

20:12.544 --> 20:14.588
- That's motive, right there.
- That is motive, that is.

20:14.671 --> 20:17.758
Aha, but I will tell you
it's been a blessing

20:17.841 --> 20:20.260
because it took me out of my comfort zone

20:20.344 --> 20:23.096
and it forced me
to take my act to the next level.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.389
So I'm very thankful for this.

20:25.098 --> 20:27.392
- Can I ask the two of you a question?
- Yeah, ask away.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.436
Sir, would you please
lift up this tape recorder

20:29.519 --> 20:32.189
that's been sitting here
the entire time in full view

20:32.272 --> 20:35.275
and you'll see that
there is in fact a single playing card.

20:35.359 --> 20:36.985
Would you, for the very first time,

20:37.069 --> 20:39.696
tell us what card
you picked out of the deck?

20:39.780 --> 20:41.031
It was the Queen of Spades.

20:41.114 --> 20:43.200
Queen of Spades.
And now, if you will just check

20:43.283 --> 20:45.786
the card right there
and tell us all, show us all

20:45.869 --> 20:49.373
that it is, in fact, the Queen of Spades.

20:49.456 --> 20:53.043
Are you kidding?

20:53.126 --> 20:53.877
Ladies and gentlemen.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.587
That is sorcery!

20:57.005 --> 20:58.257
That's incredible!

20:58.757 --> 21:01.051
No one gets that excited about the cards.

21:01.134 --> 21:02.010
Are you--

21:02.886 --> 21:05.055
Maybe if you're that scared,
you should cuff me up.

21:05.138 --> 21:08.058
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Let me get in on this.

21:08.141 --> 21:11.770
Let's see, okay, let's see. No way.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.982
You know,
the problem with handcuffs is that

21:15.065 --> 21:16.316
they sometimes don't seem to work

21:16.400 --> 21:17.985
especially on someone
who knows actual magic!

21:18.068 --> 21:18.777
He did it!

21:19.403 --> 21:20.237
Thank you very much.

21:22.239 --> 21:24.783
Gentlemen, I would love to stick around
all day and do my whole act,

21:24.866 --> 21:27.035
but I have to get going.
I have a children's show today

21:27.119 --> 21:28.704
and I have to Scotchgard my rabbit.

21:28.787 --> 21:30.122
So if I'm free to go…

21:30.205 --> 21:34.334
Uh, gentlemen, I bid you farewell.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.968
Hey, sorry, it's down the hall

21:43.051 --> 21:44.970
through the double doors
and then to the right or left?

21:45.053 --> 21:48.307
Yeah, yeah, through the--
and to the-- to your right, yes.

21:48.390 --> 21:49.975
- Right, okay.
- Okay.

21:51.476 --> 21:54.313
<i>We had one more suspect,</i>
<i>and to get to her,</i>

21:54.396 --> 21:56.732
<i>Conan was going to have</i>
<i>to make a house call.</i>

21:56.815 --> 21:59.568
Alright, this is the home
of Kathy Johanson.

21:59.651 --> 22:05.949
She's the leader of the local chapter
of Mothers Against Magic Association.

22:06.033 --> 22:09.953
They believe that magic
can lead to the occult,

22:10.454 --> 22:13.206
devil worship, and S-E-X.

22:14.374 --> 22:15.334
Sex.

22:15.417 --> 22:17.377
You knew what I meant when I said--?

22:17.461 --> 22:19.046
- Yeah. I spelled it out.
- I see.

22:19.129 --> 22:21.965
So what I need you to do is,
I need to get in there and infiltrate

22:22.049 --> 22:24.760
and see if she is capable of murder.

22:24.843 --> 22:26.762
And you're going to use this earpiece,

22:26.845 --> 22:29.473
where I got an earpiece in
and you're going to use this ear piece.

22:29.556 --> 22:31.058
And I'm going to put that in and I--

22:31.141 --> 22:34.686
You're gonna put it in and you're just
going to listen to what I got to tell you.

22:35.687 --> 22:38.565
And just do exactly as I say.

22:38.648 --> 22:39.191
Okay.

22:39.274 --> 22:40.942
But we need a code word. Obviously.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.527
If things go south.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.571
If things go south,
we're going to need a code word.

22:44.654 --> 22:45.614
I got it.

22:47.491 --> 22:48.492
Tittynope.

22:49.159 --> 22:50.202
Tittynope.

22:50.285 --> 22:51.870
Yeah, you know what "Tittynope" means?

22:51.953 --> 22:52.621
No, I don't.

22:52.704 --> 22:55.957
It's like a small gathering
of like leftovers.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.876
Like a crumbs or whatever on a plate.

22:57.959 --> 22:59.878
- Oh, a little tittynope.
- Yeah, it's a little tittynope.

22:59.961 --> 23:01.588
This is a great ride, by the way.

23:02.089 --> 23:02.672
Thank you.

23:02.756 --> 23:05.300
Yeah, is it a car or a party favor?

23:08.011 --> 23:09.054
Oh, you're kidding.

23:09.721 --> 23:10.597
I should go.

23:13.725 --> 23:17.354
<i>Alright, Conan. I want you</i>
<i>to approach the door and knock.</i>

23:25.320 --> 23:27.989
Hello, there, lovely woman.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.825
Well, hello there, lovely woman.

23:31.201 --> 23:35.205
I'm sorry, but this is a private event
for mothers only.

23:35.288 --> 23:36.790
<i>Yeah, but I just moved to town.</i>

23:36.873 --> 23:38.667
Yeah, you see, I just moved to town.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.335
<i>And I really hate magic.</i>

23:40.418 --> 23:41.753
And I hate magic.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.672
<i>Can I get some kind of a day pass?</i>

23:43.755 --> 23:46.550
And I thought maybe
I could get a day pass. Is that cool?

23:47.926 --> 23:49.010
What's your name?

23:49.094 --> 23:50.387
<i>It's Todd.</i>

23:50.470 --> 23:52.722
- It's Todd.
- Todd, Todd what?

23:52.806 --> 23:54.141
<i>Todd Caring…</i>

23:54.224 --> 23:56.518
My name is Todd Caring.

23:56.601 --> 23:57.269
<i>Ton.</i>

23:57.352 --> 23:58.562
- Ton.
<i>- Berg.</i>

23:59.104 --> 24:01.022
Caringtonberg. My name--

24:01.106 --> 24:01.606
<i>Son.</i>

24:01.690 --> 24:04.276
I'm sorry, Todd Caringtonbergson, and--

24:04.359 --> 24:05.152
<i>Field.</i>

24:05.902 --> 24:06.570
Field.

24:06.653 --> 24:09.447
Where are you from,
Todd Caringtonbergensonfield?

24:09.531 --> 24:11.241
<i>Just pick a state that nobody lives in.</i>

24:11.741 --> 24:12.701
I'm from Idaho.

24:12.784 --> 24:13.910
I grew up in Idaho.

24:15.036 --> 24:17.747
You're doing great, partner. Really great.

24:17.831 --> 24:19.833
But listen, you're on your own
for a few minutes.

24:19.916 --> 24:21.751
<i>There's something really important</i>
<i>I need to do.</i>

24:22.377 --> 24:26.298
I'm sure that you heard
what happened to my son, Jimothy.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.884
One day he was practicing
coin tricks in front of the mirror.

24:28.967 --> 24:30.594
The next, he's God knows where,

24:31.178 --> 24:33.847
doing street magic
and playing Hide the Honker.

24:33.930 --> 24:34.723
Yes, so--

24:34.806 --> 24:37.100
You'd think these magicians

24:37.184 --> 24:40.228
would take responsibility
for their actions, but they don't care.

24:40.312 --> 24:43.982
I've been begging Captivating Keith
for years to think of the children.

24:44.065 --> 24:45.317
- Yeah.
- Begged him.

24:45.901 --> 24:48.945
And if that poor assistant of his,
if her murder

24:49.029 --> 24:51.031
saves even one child from a life of magic,

24:51.114 --> 24:52.199
it would have been worth it.

24:52.282 --> 24:54.242
- Can I make you a snack?
- Yes.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.243
Todd.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.494
- Yes, that's fine.
- Okay.

24:56.578 --> 25:00.165
Let me get you a bowl
of Helen's famous chili!

25:00.248 --> 25:01.291
Oh, I'm--

25:01.374 --> 25:03.043
Thank you, Helen.

25:03.126 --> 25:04.586
Yeah, I can already believe--

25:04.669 --> 25:07.130
Here, you're gonna want some of this on it

25:07.214 --> 25:08.423
because, to be honest,

25:09.424 --> 25:12.969
that cat food
has more taste than this chili.

25:13.053 --> 25:17.349
So let me get this straight.
You're angry and you're happy.

25:17.432 --> 25:19.643
I wouldn't say happy, it's a death. But

25:20.560 --> 25:24.522
if you think about
the power of death and life after.

25:26.274 --> 25:27.692
- How's that?
- It's so good.

25:27.776 --> 25:28.735
- Yes?
- It's so good.

25:28.818 --> 25:29.527
Oh, my goodness.

25:29.611 --> 25:30.946
I've got to get
this meeting started!

25:31.029 --> 25:33.990
Okay, let's sit you down
right over here. Todd.

25:34.074 --> 25:35.492
Oh. Oh, yes. Right here? Sure.

25:35.575 --> 25:36.284
Hudson.

25:36.785 --> 25:39.955
Thank you so much.
Let's get started, ladies.

25:40.038 --> 25:40.914
Why don't we gather around?

25:40.997 --> 25:42.791
Okay, now before we get started,

25:42.874 --> 25:45.085
I'd like to introduce
a very special guest.

25:45.168 --> 25:48.004
Todd, go ahead and stand up. Don't be shy.

25:48.088 --> 25:49.839
- Todd, ladies, this is Todd.

25:49.923 --> 25:53.009
New members always give a testimonial

25:53.093 --> 25:56.263
and I'd like you to stand here
and tell this group of God-fearing women

25:57.055 --> 25:59.266
the moment that you realized magic

25:59.891 --> 26:01.268
is the devil's tool.

26:01.977 --> 26:03.186
Mmm…

26:03.270 --> 26:08.191
Well, I'll tell you all it was
an incredible experience that I had.

26:08.817 --> 26:10.735
- I was a child

26:11.611 --> 26:14.114
and I wanted to be a magician.

26:14.197 --> 26:15.865
So I practiced and practiced

26:15.949 --> 26:19.119
and became quite the magician,
a very good magician.

26:19.202 --> 26:22.163
And one day I went down
to the school yard, and I said,

26:22.247 --> 26:24.708
"Check this out" and I fanned out my deck,

26:24.791 --> 26:27.210
and before I could do anything else,

26:27.294 --> 26:28.503
they beat me.

26:29.212 --> 26:31.339
They beat me for 40 minutes,

26:31.423 --> 26:32.465
then they stopped,

26:32.966 --> 26:34.259
and they went and got ice cream,

26:34.342 --> 26:36.344
came back and continued beating me.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.763
And what happened to the boys
who beat you up?

26:38.847 --> 26:41.975
Well, they all became senators.
Every single one of them.

26:42.058 --> 26:42.809
Name one.

26:43.310 --> 26:44.728
Dianne Feinstein.

26:48.273 --> 26:49.607
Was the head bully.

26:50.483 --> 26:51.609
Beat me savagely.

26:51.693 --> 26:52.902
It doesn't make any sense.

26:52.986 --> 26:56.781
I'm starting to wonder if your name
is even Todd Caringtonbergenson.

26:56.865 --> 26:57.907
Oh, please.

26:57.991 --> 27:00.577
Todd, what is the state fish of Idaho?

27:00.660 --> 27:02.454
It is a…

27:03.038 --> 27:05.665
white-bellied cod.

27:05.749 --> 27:06.833
Wrong!

27:06.916 --> 27:08.335
It's the cutthroat trout.

27:08.418 --> 27:09.836
Well, who knows the state fish?

27:09.919 --> 27:12.172
This person is an imposter, ladies,

27:12.255 --> 27:15.091
and he's using the art of illusion

27:15.175 --> 27:17.302
to get us to have S-E-X.

27:17.385 --> 27:18.261
No!

27:18.345 --> 27:20.430
Get him! Mama! Mama!

27:20.513 --> 27:22.849
- Mama! Mama! Mama!
- Tittynope! Tittynope!

27:22.932 --> 27:24.267
<i>…just appeared then.</i>

27:24.351 --> 27:27.771
<i>Now, we have to do French drop</i>
<i>which is a ball transfer,</i>

27:27.854 --> 27:30.023
<i>reach forward again, and again you say,</i>

27:30.106 --> 27:32.984
<i>"Oh, is that another quarter in your ear?"</i>

27:33.068 --> 27:34.861
<i>Mama! Mama! Mama!</i>

27:35.445 --> 27:35.945
Conan.

27:36.446 --> 27:38.656
- <i>Tittynope. Tittynope.</i>
- Conan, what's going on? What's going on?

27:38.740 --> 27:40.909
- Tittynope! Tittynope!
- Mama! Mama!

27:40.992 --> 27:43.453
Alright, lock yourself
in a safe room, Conan.

27:43.536 --> 27:44.954
I'm coming to save you.

27:45.038 --> 27:47.415
- Tittynope!
- Mama! Mama! Mama!

27:52.545 --> 27:55.131
It's locked. We can wait him out, though.

27:55.840 --> 27:59.135
Ladies! There's a guy in the corner
asking kids to pick a card.

28:00.136 --> 28:01.304
Any card!

28:05.225 --> 28:09.104
Conan! It's senior detective,
Terry Seattle. You can come out now.

28:10.647 --> 28:11.481
You're safe.

28:12.565 --> 28:14.776
- You're safe. Are you okay?
- I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm good.

28:14.859 --> 28:16.152
All right, let's get the hell out of--

28:16.903 --> 28:18.279
Wow. Look at all these snacks.

28:18.363 --> 28:19.739
Let's grab some stuff, come on.

28:21.032 --> 28:23.743
They got plain tortillas.
I can never find plain tortillas.

28:23.827 --> 28:24.494
Well, they're pretty available.

28:24.577 --> 28:26.204
No, but every time
I go to the grocery store, I'm like,

28:26.287 --> 28:27.747
"Do you have any plain tortillas?"
they're like, "No, we're fresh out."

28:27.831 --> 28:29.290
They're very available.

28:29.374 --> 28:32.085
Everyone has plain tortillas.

28:32.168 --> 28:34.129
<i>It was time for Conan to decide</i>

28:34.212 --> 28:35.839
<i>who killed poor Sarah,</i>

28:35.922 --> 28:39.008
<i>so we lured the three suspects</i>
<i>back to the library</i>

28:39.092 --> 28:41.886
<i>under the guise of another magic show.</i>

28:43.471 --> 28:47.142
Ladies and gentlemen, we will not
be performing any illusions tonight.

28:47.642 --> 28:52.063
No, in fact, if anything,
we will be removing an illusion.

28:52.814 --> 28:53.732
The illusion

28:54.315 --> 28:55.859
of innocence.

28:56.359 --> 28:57.152
That's right.

28:57.652 --> 29:00.572
Before us here are these three top hats.

29:00.655 --> 29:02.657
In each one is the name of a suspect.

29:02.741 --> 29:03.950
My partner, Conan O'Brien,

29:04.033 --> 29:07.287
will now reveal who he believes
committed this murder.

29:07.370 --> 29:09.664
Conan, was it Deb,

29:10.165 --> 29:12.167
was it Magic Melvin,

29:12.667 --> 29:14.377
or was it Kathy?

29:14.878 --> 29:15.587
Conan,

29:16.463 --> 29:19.966
please choose who you think is the killer.

29:29.184 --> 29:30.518
The murderer…!

29:33.313 --> 29:35.315
Magic Melvin.

29:36.733 --> 29:37.317
No.

29:39.068 --> 29:40.612
What is going on here?

29:40.695 --> 29:43.072
Chief, we figured out who the killer is.

29:43.156 --> 29:44.491
Conan figured it out.

29:44.574 --> 29:48.077
I have all the logic
as to why it has to be Magic Melvin.

29:48.161 --> 29:51.247
I'm not sure exactly
why I dressed as a magician,

29:52.040 --> 29:54.292
but I am certain

29:55.251 --> 29:57.337
<i>he</i> is the murderer.

29:57.420 --> 29:59.088
And what is your evidence?

29:59.172 --> 30:00.256
Magic Melvin,

30:00.340 --> 30:03.593
you told us that you had
to go Scotchgard your rabbit.

30:04.302 --> 30:07.514
Maybe to keep hot sauce off the rabbit,

30:08.473 --> 30:11.392
because who leaves hot sauce
on a saw and no fingerprints?

30:12.435 --> 30:14.312
Why, sir, that is the act

30:15.980 --> 30:17.023
of a magician.

30:18.024 --> 30:19.317
I also think you had another motive.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.362
I think that Kathy is your mother.

30:22.987 --> 30:25.073
That you hate your mother

30:25.782 --> 30:27.909
and that because
she's turned her back on magic,

30:28.409 --> 30:29.661
you wanted to frame her.

30:30.370 --> 30:31.704
That part's pretty far-fetched.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.790
I'm the youngest person in this room.

30:34.415 --> 30:35.542
I understand.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.627
And I don't know
how the whole age thing works.

30:37.710 --> 30:39.003
I'm still working on that.

30:39.087 --> 30:41.130
It's very possible I could be your father.

30:41.631 --> 30:42.757
- Yeah.
- Age-wise.

30:43.258 --> 30:44.759
Conan O'Brien,

30:44.843 --> 30:48.304
it brings me no joy
to tell you that you are…

30:49.764 --> 30:51.140
100%…

30:55.812 --> 30:56.563
Correct.

30:56.646 --> 30:57.605
Yes!

30:58.231 --> 30:59.524
Yes!

30:59.607 --> 31:03.695
It was Magic Melvin
who killed the magician's assistant.

31:04.195 --> 31:08.408
You did notice that Melvin put hot sauce
on his breakfast burrito every morning.

31:08.491 --> 31:12.203
Three eggs soft scrambled,
onions, peppers, Tabasco--

31:12.287 --> 31:14.664
And owned a rabbit for his act.

31:14.747 --> 31:16.457
I have to Scotchgard my rabbit.

31:16.541 --> 31:19.878
We know it couldn't have been Deb.
She was allergic to pets.

31:19.961 --> 31:24.382
My boyfriend tried to cheer me up by
buying me a puppy, but I have allergies!

31:24.465 --> 31:27.051
Meanwhile Kathy
had more motive than anyone,

31:27.677 --> 31:29.762
but she didn't know
how to pick the lock on the door

31:29.846 --> 31:34.309
when you ran
like an overgrown gazelle for safety.

31:35.018 --> 31:36.019
It's locked.

31:36.102 --> 31:39.731
But you know who could pick a lock?
Magic Melvin.

31:39.814 --> 31:41.816
Especially on someone
who knows actual--

31:41.900 --> 31:44.777
- He did it!
- Thank you very much.

31:44.861 --> 31:48.072
Magic Melvin was the killer.

31:49.282 --> 31:50.491
Take him away.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.329
I only murdered her
'cause I wanted her dead!

31:54.913 --> 31:57.957
It's a very-- It's a good reason
to murder somebody.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.501
The handcuffs
are not going to work on him.

32:00.585 --> 32:02.253
Already, no handcuffs.

32:02.337 --> 32:05.173
Conan O'Brien, congratulations.

32:06.966 --> 32:08.760
Well, Conan, you did it.

32:10.094 --> 32:12.847
You solved the case,
even though your logic was…

32:13.556 --> 32:15.224
crazy nonsensical.

32:16.059 --> 32:18.061
But you make a fantastic cop.

32:20.021 --> 32:21.564
You know, I also learned something.

32:22.106 --> 32:23.942
I learned a little magic trick.

32:24.025 --> 32:24.901
You learned magic.

32:24.984 --> 32:27.737
That's right. Go ahead and sneeze.

32:29.238 --> 32:29.948
Here.

32:30.531 --> 32:32.617
Let me get you a handkerchief.

32:33.201 --> 32:33.826
Go ahead.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.831
I've got a handkerchief.

32:40.917 --> 32:43.628
It's not ending. It's not ending.

32:43.711 --> 32:45.254
This is legitimately not ending.

32:45.338 --> 32:47.131
- It's a lot of--
- I'm getting--

32:48.174 --> 32:50.635
Okay, you know what?
Now, I just hate magic. This is stupid.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.763
<i>On the next episode</i>
<i>of</i> Murderville…

32:53.846 --> 32:56.057
Terry say hi
to your new partner, Marshawn Lynch.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.184
- How much training have you had?
- I watched <i>Training Day</i>.

33:00.853 --> 33:02.981
This was the murder weapon.
