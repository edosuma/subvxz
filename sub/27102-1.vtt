02:04:42.746 --> 02:04:46.048
Last night,
I had a vision of us

02:04:46.050 --> 02:04:48.687
making love beneath the earth,

02:04:49.754 --> 02:04:52.055

02:04:52.057 --> 02:04:54.626
naked in a dark pool.

02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:58.895

dissolve into light,

02:05:03.067 --> 02:05:06.836

we've ever had

02:05:06.838 --> 02:05:09.004
forms around us,

02:05:09.006 --> 02:05:12.244
and carries our souls
through space,

02:05:12.977 --> 02:05:16.078
into another world,

02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:19.315
and we're all just laughing
the whole time,

02:05:19.317 --> 02:05:24.055
because we know that nothing
can ever be wrong again.
