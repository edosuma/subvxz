01:36.661 --> 01:40.100

01:45.714 --> 01:48.934
Okay. All I see here is me.

01:48.934 --> 01:51.720
This is not what I want
to be looking at.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.461
Diane, you're muted.

01:53.461 --> 01:56.464
Seriously, how do I just not see
my own face this big, huh?

01:56.464 --> 01:57.987
You're muted.

01:57.987 --> 02:01.512
Diane, you're muted.

02:01.512 --> 02:03.558
Alexa, join my meeting.

02:03.558 --> 02:04.994
Okay.

02:04.994 --> 02:06.169
VIVIAN [over speaker]:
Hello, ladies.

02:06.169 --> 02:07.953
Hello.
Hi.

02:07.953 --> 02:11.261
Viv, have you been at
Arthur's condo this whole time?

02:11.261 --> 02:13.176
Nine days.

02:13.176 --> 02:14.786
It's a world record.

02:14.786 --> 02:16.832
- Ha!
- Shar.

02:16.832 --> 02:18.399
Are you drinking at work?

02:18.399 --> 02:21.271
Well, technically,
the courts are closed,

02:21.271 --> 02:24.709
so it's just me
and Judge Walker.

02:24.709 --> 02:26.146
My restaurant's closed, too.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.278
They said it might be
two whole weeks.

02:28.278 --> 02:30.672
Okay, I figured it out.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.500
Why am I a potato?

02:32.500 --> 02:34.110
Ay, ay, ay.

02:34.110 --> 02:36.765
Shall we talk about
<i>Normal People?</i>

02:36.765 --> 02:39.202
Something we have
very little experience with.

02:39.202 --> 02:42.118
Hey.
How do I stop being a potato?

02:42.118 --> 02:44.642
<i>One thing's for sure:</i>

02:44.642 --> 02:47.210
<i>It went on longer
than anyone imagined.</i>

02:47.210 --> 02:49.473
Ah. <i>Untamed.</i>

02:49.473 --> 02:52.520
The harrowing true story
of Viv's nether region

02:52.520 --> 02:55.175
if the waxing salon
doesn't reopen soon.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.046
All that's been lasered away
years ago.

02:57.046 --> 02:58.134
Yeah.

02:58.134 --> 03:01.659
Excuse me, um, it's 7:00 p.m.

03:01.659 --> 03:04.227
- Oh, my...

03:04.227 --> 03:06.316
Thank you, health-care workers!

03:06.316 --> 03:09.101
- Yay.
Thank you!

03:09.101 --> 03:12.931
No one's enjoying their
quarantine more than you, Viv.

03:12.931 --> 03:14.933
<i>We stayed connected</i>

03:14.933 --> 03:17.675
<i>and were there for each other
through personal hardships.</i>

03:17.675 --> 03:19.764
Look who's home
from the hospital.

03:19.764 --> 03:22.071
Bruce, you look great.

03:22.071 --> 03:24.595
A minor heart attack.
I'm doing fine.

03:24.595 --> 03:26.945
We're just taking it easy.

03:26.945 --> 03:29.209
- No more cheeseburgers.
- Mm-hmm.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.819
- Oh, yeah, but look.

03:30.819 --> 03:33.952
Got these special cookies.

03:33.952 --> 03:36.259
They're shaped like an aorta.

03:36.259 --> 03:37.391
Ugh.

03:39.001 --> 03:40.568
No.

03:40.568 --> 03:43.701
<i>And through
professional milestones.</i>

03:43.701 --> 03:46.617
♪ For she's a jolly
good fellow ♪

03:46.617 --> 03:49.751
♪ Which nobody can deny.

03:49.751 --> 03:51.448
Ta-da.

03:51.448 --> 03:54.321
I've already been asked
to perform three weddings.

03:54.321 --> 03:57.106
Once you take senior status,
that's all you're good for.

03:57.106 --> 03:59.108
- That's so sweet.
It's degrading.

03:59.108 --> 04:01.502
I didn't go to law school
so I could tell

04:01.502 --> 04:04.461
the children of my colleagues
they could kiss.

04:04.461 --> 04:06.420
<i>And like so many people,</i>

04:06.420 --> 04:10.162
<i>the time apart gave us the
opportunity to try new things.</i>

04:14.993 --> 04:16.821
That was a little dark, but...

04:16.821 --> 04:20.042
I'm pickling my own cucumbers.

04:20.042 --> 04:21.609
Oh! Oh!

04:23.001 --> 04:25.308
I have adopted a rescue parrot.

04:25.308 --> 04:27.832
His name is Sylvester.

04:27.832 --> 04:29.617
- Are you a good boy?

04:30.574 --> 04:32.620
Sylvester's been rehomed.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.665
<i>And forced us
to deal with things</i>

04:34.665 --> 04:36.580
<i>- we'd been putting off.</i>

04:37.581 --> 04:39.322
This is all I'm keeping.

04:39.322 --> 04:41.411
Well, good you're hanging on
to that coffee can, though.

04:41.411 --> 04:43.457
Oh.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.110
This is Harry.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.764
Harry?

04:46.764 --> 04:50.420
Well, yeah, the ashes.
The-the ashes of Harry. See?

04:50.420 --> 04:53.205
Was his dying wish
to be a latte?

04:53.205 --> 04:54.903
You-you can't just
leave him there.

04:54.903 --> 04:56.557
Wait a minute.
Do you think he's better off

04:56.557 --> 04:58.298
on the mantel
in Mitchell's bedroom?

04:58.298 --> 05:00.212
Probably not
what your late husband imagined

05:00.212 --> 05:02.519
as his eternal resting place.

05:02.519 --> 05:04.434
Back in the box you go.

05:04.434 --> 05:05.870
There you go.

05:05.870 --> 05:07.437
No, go spread them somewhere.

05:07.437 --> 05:09.265
Well, what am I supposed to do?

05:09.265 --> 05:11.354
I mean, I'm just supposed to go
dump him in the fields?

05:11.354 --> 05:13.791
- He's allergic to horses.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.750
<i>For a while, it felt like</i>

05:15.750 --> 05:17.534
<i>it was never going to end.</i>

05:17.534 --> 05:20.711
I liked this,
but if I wanted to read a story

05:20.711 --> 05:24.106
of a woman trapped at home,
slowly going crazy,

05:24.106 --> 05:26.500
I would've read my own diaries.

05:26.500 --> 05:30.068
<i>But everything
comes to an end at some point.</i>

05:31.809 --> 05:33.855
We had a great run, didn't we?

05:33.855 --> 05:35.857
It was the best restaurant
in Brentwood.

05:35.857 --> 05:38.294
It was the best
restaurant in Los Angeles.

05:38.294 --> 05:40.165
- Yeah, definitely.
- That's true.

05:40.165 --> 05:42.516
You guys are nice.

05:42.516 --> 05:45.127
Well, I was gonna retire
someday anyway.

05:45.127 --> 05:47.477
Come join me on the other side.

05:47.477 --> 05:49.958
It's boring, but it's boring.

05:49.958 --> 05:52.090
- Yeah.

05:52.090 --> 05:54.092
<i>Well, it had been
quite an experience,</i>

05:54.092 --> 05:58.183
<i>but our time apart
was finally coming to an end,</i>

05:58.183 --> 06:01.317
<i>and a new journey together
was about to begin.</i>

06:09.325 --> 06:12.110
DIANE [singsongy]:
Knock, knock!

06:14.678 --> 06:16.550
Oh, my God.

06:16.550 --> 06:17.986
Oh!

06:17.986 --> 06:20.075
This still feels illegal.

06:20.075 --> 06:22.120
Oh, no.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.340
Yeah. -I refuse to outlaw
the hug.

06:24.340 --> 06:26.386
What's going on here, huh?

06:26.386 --> 06:28.039
Have we officially hit the stage

06:28.039 --> 06:29.911
where we cover
our furniture in plastic?

06:29.911 --> 06:31.652
No, this is what happens
when you have

06:31.652 --> 06:33.654
- too much time on your hands.
- Yeah.

06:33.654 --> 06:35.873
I actually tried
to retile the bathroom, too.

06:35.873 --> 06:38.006
- Oh.
- That did not go well.

06:38.006 --> 06:39.573
- No?
- It's terrible.

06:39.573 --> 06:41.488
- Yoo-hoo.
- Oh!

06:41.488 --> 06:43.664
- Judge!
- Oh, please.

06:43.664 --> 06:46.623
I'm retired,
so no need for formalities.

06:46.623 --> 06:48.495
-"Your Honor" is fine.
- Oh.

06:48.495 --> 06:51.628
I never thought I'd be
this happy to hug you. Oh.

06:51.628 --> 06:53.543
Yeah. I get that a lot.

06:53.543 --> 06:55.458
Hello!

06:55.458 --> 06:57.199
- Oh! Hello.
- Oh, my God.

06:57.199 --> 07:00.028
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

07:00.028 --> 07:01.943
- Oh, my God. Oh, hi.
- Hi.

07:01.943 --> 07:03.335
Hi, sweetheart.

07:03.335 --> 07:04.815
- Hi.
- Aw.

07:04.815 --> 07:07.122
- And my pal.
- Hey, Slim.

07:07.122 --> 07:08.863
Oh, this is so great.

07:08.863 --> 07:11.256
- How are you, Slim?
- I'm so excited.

07:11.256 --> 07:13.128
Viv, uh, just one question.

07:13.128 --> 07:14.608
What's going on with the gloves?

07:14.608 --> 07:16.479
Are you planning
a jewelry heist? -

07:16.479 --> 07:19.700
Or maybe becoming
an amateur mime?

07:19.700 --> 07:21.266
Or even a professional mime,

07:21.266 --> 07:22.877
- if you put your mind to it.
- Uh-huh.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.487
Now, that would be
an exciting change.

07:24.487 --> 07:29.274
Well, actually, there has been
an exciting change.

07:29.274 --> 07:31.755
Oh, my.

07:31.755 --> 07:33.191
What's going... What?

07:33.191 --> 07:34.497
Oh, my God.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.107
- You're engaged?
- Oh, it's gorgeous.

07:36.107 --> 07:38.501
- Can you believe it?
- No, I can't.

07:38.501 --> 07:40.155
- Vivian.
- Oh, I have so many questions.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.245
- When did this happen?
- Well...

07:43.245 --> 07:45.116
Wait, wait, wait.
Come sit down and tell us

07:45.116 --> 07:46.422
- every single thing.
- We need details.

07:46.422 --> 07:47.771
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

07:47.771 --> 07:49.556
Oh, my God, Viv,
this is amazing.

07:49.556 --> 07:51.427
- Oh, no.

07:51.427 --> 07:54.996
Oh, my God. Well, uh, it was
actually... it was last night.

07:54.996 --> 07:56.780
I can't believe
that it was last night.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.695
We were walking back
to the apartment,

07:58.695 --> 08:01.219
and he made some comment
about proposing,

08:01.219 --> 08:03.874
and I made a comment,
"Well, if not now, when?"

08:03.874 --> 08:06.094
Because in another 50 years,

08:06.094 --> 08:09.358
I may not find him
as attractive as I do now.

08:09.358 --> 08:12.796
And right then, we were
in front of a jewelry store.

08:12.796 --> 08:15.277
And before I know it,
we're in the store,

08:15.277 --> 08:17.279
saying, "Should we do this?

08:17.279 --> 08:19.760
I mean, should we get married?"

08:19.760 --> 08:21.370
- And we are!

08:21.370 --> 08:24.068
- Oh, my God. Oh!
- We are.

08:24.068 --> 08:25.722
- Please.
- Oh.

08:25.722 --> 08:27.507
To Viv and Arthur.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.204
Oh, thank you.

08:29.204 --> 08:30.684
- Cheers.
- Oh, beautiful.

08:30.684 --> 08:31.946
Thank you, my pals.

08:31.946 --> 08:33.556
So, do you have a date yet?

08:33.556 --> 08:35.123
Oh, I think I'll go with Arthur.

08:35.123 --> 08:36.690
What?

08:36.690 --> 08:38.343
As my date.

08:38.343 --> 08:39.910
Do we have to laugh
at her bad jokes

08:39.910 --> 08:41.129
- since she's the bride?
- No, well, I think we do.

08:41.129 --> 08:42.260
- I think that's the rule.
- Yeah.

08:42.260 --> 08:43.740
Sharon is correct.

08:45.089 --> 08:46.526
Look at you.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.702
- Is this new?
- Well, it is to me.

08:48.702 --> 08:51.879
I assume the man who owns it
purchased it years ago.

08:51.879 --> 08:56.144
Oh, well, I'm glad your vagina
hasn't claimed senior status.

08:56.144 --> 08:58.450
- Who's the lucky sailor?
- Not a clue.

08:58.450 --> 09:01.497
I found it in the back seat
of my car. Finders keepers.

09:01.497 --> 09:03.586
- Oh, my God.

09:03.586 --> 09:06.067
I really don't understand
how you make that work.

09:06.067 --> 09:08.765
Well, now you know why she keeps
having to get her hip replaced.

09:08.765 --> 09:11.812
People with mechanical knees
should not throw stones.

09:13.248 --> 09:16.425
- Oh. Oh, my God, you guys.
- What? What?

09:17.861 --> 09:21.256
I have to show you what I found
when I was cleaning up.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.954
Cleaning up?
What did it look like before?

09:23.954 --> 09:25.695
Look. I think it's an omen.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.262
An omen?

09:27.262 --> 09:30.439
This is from the trip
that never was.

09:30.439 --> 09:32.615
Remember, we were all
gonna go to Italy.

09:32.615 --> 09:33.964
Oh.

09:33.964 --> 09:35.662
Oh, Italy.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.446
Right?
Oh, my God.

09:37.446 --> 09:39.230
Our dream vacation,
before, of course,

09:39.230 --> 09:41.363
I got pregnant
and ruined everything.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.626
- Pan Am?

09:43.626 --> 09:45.280
Can you believe
that one of these

09:45.280 --> 09:47.108
used to get us on a plane?

09:47.108 --> 09:49.632
I can't even look at those.

09:49.632 --> 09:51.721
"Surprise Gianni.

09:51.721 --> 09:53.897
Taste his magical
meatballs again."

09:53.897 --> 09:55.246
Oh.

09:55.246 --> 09:57.205
-"Do not live in fear."
- Oh, God.

09:57.205 --> 09:58.728
Okay, that's not...

09:58.728 --> 10:00.991
-"Taste his magical meatballs"?
- Shh!

10:00.991 --> 10:03.341
"Do not live in fear"?
How big are they?

10:03.341 --> 10:05.169
- Oh, Gianni.

10:05.169 --> 10:06.562
Who is Gianni?

10:06.562 --> 10:08.346
Okay, he was the Italian hottie

10:08.346 --> 10:11.698
from my cooking school
a million trillion years ago.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.482
Probably fat and bald now.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.440
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Don't ruin my memories.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.920
- Anyway, that's not the point.

10:16.920 --> 10:19.531
- The point is I found this.
- Yeah.

10:19.531 --> 10:22.143
The travel ban is lifted,

10:22.143 --> 10:24.319
and I think
we should all go to Italy.

10:24.319 --> 10:26.451
Italy? Whoa.

10:26.451 --> 10:28.062
I mean, I barely made it here.

10:28.062 --> 10:30.238
Yeah, I-I-I can't go
anywhere, right?

10:30.238 --> 10:32.632
I'm a newly engaged woman, remember?

10:32.632 --> 10:34.721
Oh, that-that's it.

10:34.721 --> 10:37.201
We'll make it
Viv's bachelorette.

10:37.201 --> 10:39.377
Oh, I literally
just got chill bumps.

10:39.377 --> 10:41.205
It's perfect.

10:41.205 --> 10:43.686
You want us to run around Italy
like a bunch of teenagers?

10:43.686 --> 10:47.647
The book says ignoring the signs
is what ruins a life.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.258
- We can't reject our destiny.
- Yeah.

10:50.258 --> 10:52.739
I love the idea
of drinking Italian wine

10:52.739 --> 10:54.741
and celebrating Vivian,

10:54.741 --> 10:57.221
but can't we just do that
from here?

10:57.221 --> 10:59.267
I'm with Shar.

10:59.267 --> 11:02.009
You know, it-it doesn't feel
right leaving Arthur right now.

11:02.009 --> 11:04.707
And my little Ginsburger
has not been feeling well.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.927
I don't feel good about
leaving her, either. -Mm.

11:06.927 --> 11:09.712
You know that we might never
have a chance

11:09.712 --> 11:12.106
to do something like this again.

11:13.063 --> 11:15.065
Such is fate.

11:16.632 --> 11:18.416
<i>A bachelorette?</i>

11:18.416 --> 11:21.332
And you said you didn't
want to go because of me?

11:21.332 --> 11:24.205
No. Well, I mean, yeah,
that's what I said,

11:24.205 --> 11:25.423
but not because of you.

11:25.423 --> 11:26.816
Because of us.

11:26.816 --> 11:28.383
- Well...
- You know, our relationship.

11:28.383 --> 11:30.515
Well, that's not right.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.736
Not because of
"our relationship."

11:33.736 --> 11:35.172
Because of our engagement.

11:35.172 --> 11:37.827
I mean, my point was
we're engaged,

11:37.827 --> 11:39.437
so if I'm gonna run off
to Italy,

11:39.437 --> 11:41.178
- it should be with you.

11:41.178 --> 11:43.790
Well, I'd love that,
but just 'cause we're engaged

11:43.790 --> 11:46.401
doesn't mean you can't go on
a trip with your best friends.

11:46.401 --> 11:47.924
Really?

11:47.924 --> 11:49.534
Viv, Jesus Christ.

11:49.534 --> 11:51.406
Actually, that is
Saint Christopher.

11:51.406 --> 11:52.755
Oh, God.

11:52.755 --> 11:54.583
He's the patron saint of travel.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.411
So, if you're planning a trip,

11:56.411 --> 11:58.630
well, this is
the right place to start.

11:58.630 --> 12:00.850
- How about that for a sign?
- Wow.

12:03.505 --> 12:04.941
- Oh, boy.

12:07.552 --> 12:11.252
Hello. You've reached the home
of the retired and gifted.

12:11.252 --> 12:13.167
So...

12:13.167 --> 12:15.952
we need to go to Italy.

12:15.952 --> 12:18.607
Why are you saying that?
I already told you I can't go.

12:18.607 --> 12:20.261
I wanted to score a few points

12:20.261 --> 12:21.871
by telling Arthur
that I wasn't gonna go

12:21.871 --> 12:24.134
because I'm being sensitive
to his feelings

12:24.134 --> 12:26.223
now that we're "en-fianced."

12:26.223 --> 12:28.008
That's not a word.

12:28.008 --> 12:29.923
"En-fianced," "a-fianced."

12:29.923 --> 12:32.273
- I-I don't know.

12:33.187 --> 12:34.754
Where are you?

12:34.754 --> 12:36.451
I'm in a church.

12:36.451 --> 12:38.366
You're in a church?

12:38.366 --> 12:40.107
We're looking for a venue
for the wedding.

12:40.107 --> 12:43.023
You're going to get married
in a church?

12:43.023 --> 12:45.634
Hope they don't run
a background check.

12:45.634 --> 12:47.462
I'm shocked you didn't
burst into flames

12:47.462 --> 12:49.290
as you crossed the threshold.

12:49.290 --> 12:51.901
The point is, Sharon,
now if we don't go,

12:51.901 --> 12:53.685
he'll think I think
he was testing me

12:53.685 --> 12:55.992
and that I don't think
he actually thinks we should go.

12:55.992 --> 12:57.994
I-I think
you're overthinking this.

12:57.994 --> 12:59.474
I don't think so.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.432
- I think we need to go.
Ginsie.

13:01.432 --> 13:03.086
- Honey, it's Sharon. Say hi.
- Ginsie.

13:03.086 --> 13:04.696
Oh, hey. Hi, Sharon.

13:04.696 --> 13:06.698
I'm excited about
your trip to Italy.

13:06.698 --> 13:08.309
Oh, my God.

13:08.309 --> 13:10.311
Oh, shit.

13:10.311 --> 13:14.141
Oh, Sh-Sharon,
y-you're on speaker in a church.

13:14.141 --> 13:15.664
Ginsie.

13:15.664 --> 13:17.884
Jesus fucking Christ.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.929
Uh, I'll call you back.

13:22.236 --> 13:23.846
It's another omen.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.500
DIANE [over phone]:
I don't understand.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.284
Dead like dead-dead?

13:27.284 --> 13:29.896
Yes. What other kind
of dead is there?

13:29.896 --> 13:31.680
Don't cats have nine lives?

13:31.680 --> 13:34.030
Ho-Hold on. Sharon's coming.

13:34.030 --> 13:37.251
They think it was just old age.

13:37.251 --> 13:40.907
It's unnatural for your child
to go before you.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.386
Aw, honey.

13:42.386 --> 13:44.388
- Honey, I'm so sorry.
- Oh.

13:44.388 --> 13:46.477
Well, I'm-I'm just on
with Diane.

13:46.477 --> 13:47.870
I'll put her on speaker.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.263
Oh, no, no, no,
wait, wait, wait, no, no.

13:49.263 --> 13:50.699
I would just say
the wrong thing.

13:50.699 --> 13:52.179
Hi, Di.

13:52.179 --> 13:55.965
No, even my name is wrong
at a time like this.

13:55.965 --> 13:58.185
I think this might be an omen.

13:59.186 --> 14:01.971
Yes, the universe is conspiring.

14:01.971 --> 14:03.407
I mean, is... Oh, God.

14:03.407 --> 14:05.192
Is it? Is it really?

14:05.192 --> 14:09.239
And even if it's not,
I say we discuss it in Italy.

14:09.239 --> 14:10.284
Are you serious?

14:10.284 --> 14:12.503
I'm retired. My cat is dead.

14:12.503 --> 14:14.766
We're talking about
going to the top

14:14.766 --> 14:16.768
wine-producing country
in the world.

14:16.768 --> 14:19.206
Yes, I'm serious.

14:19.206 --> 14:20.642
Let's do this.

14:20.642 --> 14:22.557
I'm looping in Viv.

14:22.557 --> 14:25.255
We have to go to Italy.

14:25.255 --> 14:26.953
You're in, too?

14:26.953 --> 14:28.519
Didn't Sharon tell you
what happened?

14:28.519 --> 14:31.392
- About her cat?
- No. Arthur.

14:31.392 --> 14:33.133
Oh, God. Did he die, too?

14:33.133 --> 14:34.699
Diane.

14:34.699 --> 14:36.701
I was worried there was a theme.

14:36.701 --> 14:39.400
He thinks it would be wrong
for us not to go.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.315
I mean, is that sweet or what?

14:41.315 --> 14:43.230
You should marry that guy.

14:43.230 --> 14:44.535
And I will.

14:44.535 --> 14:46.537
But first, Italy.

14:46.537 --> 14:48.800
Can you believe it?

14:48.800 --> 14:50.759
You're on your way to Tuscany.

14:50.759 --> 14:53.109
Ugh. God.

14:53.109 --> 14:55.198
-"Ugh"?
- Ugh, I know.

14:55.198 --> 14:57.331
You're the first person
in the world to "ugh" Tuscany.

14:57.331 --> 14:59.637
I wasn't "ugh-ing" Tuscany.

14:59.637 --> 15:01.161
Ah, nice try.

15:01.161 --> 15:02.597
There's just an absurdity
to the whole thing.

15:02.597 --> 15:04.947
A bachelorette trip?
What are we doing?

15:04.947 --> 15:06.731
Well, Vivian's getting married.

15:06.731 --> 15:09.125
Which is, you know,
a little bit nuts.

15:10.126 --> 15:11.954
I think it's very romantic.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.521
But it's also nuts.

15:13.521 --> 15:15.088
You got to admit that.

15:15.088 --> 15:16.828
Well, you're the one
who's been married before.

15:16.828 --> 15:17.873
You tell me.

15:17.873 --> 15:19.309
No, no. I was pregnant.

15:19.309 --> 15:20.484
It's different.

15:20.484 --> 15:22.486
Oh, that's so romantic.

15:22.486 --> 15:25.141
Not as romantic as
never getting married at all.

15:26.708 --> 15:28.362
- Hello?

15:28.362 --> 15:29.929
One little goodbye kiss, maybe?

15:29.929 --> 15:31.191
- A little goodbye...
- Maybe one.

15:31.191 --> 15:32.714
Oh, excited.

15:32.714 --> 15:35.325
Oh. Mm.

15:35.325 --> 15:37.240
Mmm.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.808
- Get out of here.
- Uh-huh. Okay.

15:39.808 --> 15:41.331

we're actually here.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.827
I love this city.

16:42.827 --> 16:45.526
- Rome. Roma.

16:45.526 --> 16:48.920
And not just because I had
<i>due</i> proseccos at lunch.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.792
- Yeah, sure.

16:50.792 --> 16:55.753
Me, too. I love anything that's
falling apart more than I am.

16:55.753 --> 16:57.364
- You know,

16:57.364 --> 16:59.105
it's amazing, though, isn't it,

16:59.105 --> 17:00.889
how many tourists there are
in the world?

17:00.889 --> 17:02.673
Well, wait a minute.
We're tourists.

17:02.673 --> 17:04.197
- Yes, but we're different.
- Oh.

17:04.197 --> 17:06.025
- We're not so obvious.
- Yeah.

17:06.025 --> 17:10.116
No, no, no. Judge's fanny pack
screams, "I'm a local."

17:10.116 --> 17:12.901
- It's called a waist wallet.
- Oh.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.685
Oh, well, that changes
everything. -

17:14.685 --> 17:17.297
Yeah, and it's not just fashion.

17:17.297 --> 17:20.213
- It's also functional.
- No. Ah...

17:20.213 --> 17:22.128
Hey, is it time?

17:22.128 --> 17:23.781
- What?
- Oh, yeah. No, no.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.957
- It is time.
- Okay.

17:25.957 --> 17:27.611
- What?
- Uh-huh.

17:27.611 --> 17:30.701
- Oh, yes.
- Let's do it.

17:30.701 --> 17:32.747
- Oh, my God, you...
- Yes, yes!

17:32.747 --> 17:34.357
Oh, I can't believe you guys.

17:34.357 --> 17:38.448
Well, believe it, because
this is your bachelorette.

17:38.448 --> 17:40.102
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

17:40.102 --> 17:42.061
And we're not gonna
let you forget it, okay?

17:42.061 --> 17:43.758
- Oh, and there's a veil.
- Oh. Oh, yeah.

17:43.758 --> 17:45.238
Oh, my Lord.

17:45.238 --> 17:46.413
- Congratulations to the bride!
- There you go.

17:46.413 --> 17:47.718
Oh, thank you.

17:47.718 --> 17:49.111
- Thank you, thank you.
- Thank you.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.113
Oh, God, you look so great.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.941
- You look perfect.

17:52.941 --> 17:55.117
I look like
a crossing guard in this.

17:55.117 --> 17:57.902
No, crossing guards
wear vests now.

18:03.430 --> 18:04.953
What did he say?

18:04.953 --> 18:06.607
I'm-I'm trying...
I'm trying to translate here.

18:06.607 --> 18:08.957
Oh, okay, <i>"vecchie."</i>
It means "old."

18:08.957 --> 18:10.350
- What?
- Yeah.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.700
- Oh.
- He called us old?

18:12.700 --> 18:14.876
He basically called us
an old fruit.

18:14.876 --> 18:16.356
- Oh, my...

18:16.356 --> 18:18.140
I'm gonna cause
an international incident.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.447
- Wait. <i>"Dolce"</i> means "sweet."
- Yeah. What?

18:20.447 --> 18:24.886
Okay. "The older the vines,
the sweeter the fruit."

18:24.886 --> 18:27.889
- Oh!

18:29.325 --> 18:30.500
- Yes, we've still got it.
- Look at us.

18:30.500 --> 18:31.980
Yeah, we got it.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.634
The question is:
What are we gonna do with it?

18:33.634 --> 18:35.114
Well, this is
a bachelorette party,

18:35.114 --> 18:36.506
- so you know what that means.
- Okay.

18:36.506 --> 18:39.814
It means that we go
see naked men.

18:39.814 --> 18:42.991
" continues]

18:42.991 --> 18:45.254
What's the protocol here?

18:45.254 --> 18:48.649
Where do I stuff
the dollar bills?

18:48.649 --> 18:50.999
I-I think some of these guys
are the same dancers

18:50.999 --> 18:53.349
- from my bachelorette party.

18:55.003 --> 18:56.961
Look at those nail beds.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.661
I really need a pedicure.

19:02.750 --> 19:06.362
"I lost my hand!"

19:06.362 --> 19:08.495
Nic Cage, <i>Moonstruck.</i>

19:10.061 --> 19:12.325
Oh, wow.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.980
She's almost 2,000 years old.

19:15.980 --> 19:18.548
She's definitely had work done.

19:20.507 --> 19:23.727
I got the same perm
back in 1982.

19:28.254 --> 19:32.214
In his defense,
it is a little chilly in here.

19:32.214 --> 19:33.433
Give him some credit.

19:33.433 --> 19:34.912
I mean,
he's a thousand years old

19:34.912 --> 19:36.610
and still hard as a rock.

19:36.610 --> 19:38.133
Oh, my God.

19:38.133 --> 19:40.222
What is Bruce doing?

19:40.222 --> 19:42.224
Wait a minute.
Are you spying on him?

19:42.224 --> 19:43.834
No, no, I got an alert.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.967
There was movement
in the kitchen.

19:47.403 --> 19:48.578
Bacon?

19:48.578 --> 19:50.711
Oh, God. He can't...

19:50.711 --> 19:52.408
What, is he insane?

19:52.408 --> 19:54.367
- Oh, <i>uno momen...</i>
- Bruce!

19:57.457 --> 19:59.763
Carol, you scared
the hell out of me.

19:59.763 --> 20:03.854
Bruce, you know you're not
allowed to eat bacon.

20:03.854 --> 20:05.943
No, no, it's not
what it looks like.

20:05.943 --> 20:08.337
It looks like you're hiding
bacon behind your back.

20:08.337 --> 20:10.339
Wrong.

20:10.339 --> 20:12.211
No bacon.

20:15.344 --> 20:17.172
I see you, Bruce.

20:19.957 --> 20:21.481
- Oh, oh.

20:21.481 --> 20:25.267
- Oh... Oh, whoa.
- Wow.

20:28.314 --> 20:30.620
I've never seen
anything like it.

20:30.620 --> 20:33.101
I'm so glad we did this.

20:33.101 --> 20:34.450
Me, too.
Aw.

20:34.450 --> 20:36.365
- CAROL [chuckles]: Me, too.
- Mwah.

20:39.325 --> 20:40.587
Oh, look. Here we go.

20:40.587 --> 20:42.197
This is Via dei Coronari.

20:42.197 --> 20:45.069
- Oh.
- What's Via dei Coronari?

20:45.069 --> 20:47.420
- This road.
- So?

20:47.420 --> 20:50.249
So it's-it's beautiful
and we're taking it.

20:50.249 --> 20:53.121
Wha... I don't think
there's an ugly street

20:53.121 --> 20:54.644
- in this entire city, is there?
- No.

20:54.644 --> 20:56.472
- No. Right.
- I don't think so.

20:56.472 --> 20:58.213
- Ah, and-and look.
- Oh.

20:59.997 --> 21:01.477
Is it a sign?

21:01.477 --> 21:02.913
Oh, I think it is.

21:02.913 --> 21:05.960
I think it is definitely a sign.

21:07.788 --> 21:09.877
That is a sign, literally.

21:09.877 --> 21:11.270
<i>"Chiuso."</i> Closed.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.402
- Oh, shucks.
- Hmm.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.279
And you must be the bride.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.846
- Well, how did you know?

21:24.152 --> 21:26.763
What did you gals do?

21:26.763 --> 21:30.376
Welcome to
my humble little factory.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.378
- VIVIAN [chuckling]: Wow.
<i>Grazie.</i>

21:32.378 --> 21:34.162
- Wow.
- Oh. Whoa.

21:34.162 --> 21:35.468
Oh, my gosh.

21:35.468 --> 21:37.992
So, describe to me the dress.

21:37.992 --> 21:40.560
Tell me anything
that comes to your mind.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.779
Sexy but traditional.

21:42.779 --> 21:44.651
Sexy. <i>Naturalmente,</i> of course.

21:44.651 --> 21:47.349
- No, and timeless.
That's a good call.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.308
The last thing you want
when you look back

21:49.308 --> 21:51.005
at your photos 50 years from now

21:51.005 --> 21:53.790
is to wonder,
"What the hell was I thinking?"

21:53.790 --> 21:55.488
-  Right.

21:55.488 --> 21:57.577
Ciao. Can I interest anyone
in a prosecco?

21:57.577 --> 21:59.056
- Yes, you bet.
- Yes.

21:59.056 --> 22:01.755
Me, and you should be
interested, too.

22:01.755 --> 22:02.886
Oh, yeah.

22:04.453 --> 22:07.021
Well, uh, let's have
some fun, girls, huh?

22:07.021 --> 22:08.849
To fun.

22:12.592 --> 22:15.246
- Oh, gorgeous. Oh.

22:20.208 --> 22:21.252
Is this it?

22:21.252 --> 22:22.428
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.560
You don't pick the first one.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.606
You're not getting off
that easily.

22:26.606 --> 22:29.478
- It's too bridal.
- Mmm.

22:29.478 --> 22:30.653
Next.

22:34.135 --> 22:36.398
You look like Hugh Hefner.

22:36.398 --> 22:37.921
It's not bridal enough.

22:37.921 --> 22:39.009
I think you should change.

22:39.009 --> 22:40.271
Next.

22:40.271 --> 22:42.273
Thank you so much.

22:48.105 --> 22:51.282
God, I'd like to serve you
for Christmas dinner.

22:51.282 --> 22:52.762
Oh, my God.

22:52.762 --> 22:55.286
- Okay. Less bird. Next.
- Mm-hmm.

22:55.286 --> 22:57.158
Someone else next.

22:57.158 --> 22:59.334
Fine. When in Rome.

22:59.334 --> 23:01.336
I'm not putting on
one other thing

23:01.336 --> 23:03.730
until you're all in couture.

23:03.730 --> 23:06.428
You're not getting out of this.

23:06.428 --> 23:08.822
I'm not getting into this.

23:08.822 --> 23:10.432
Grace.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.742
- You know...
<i>- Siì.</i> I know just the one.

23:18.745 --> 23:20.007
Ta-da.

23:20.007 --> 23:21.791
Oh, my... Oh.

23:21.791 --> 23:24.968
I feel like I just escaped
from the trunk of a Cadillac.

23:29.843 --> 23:32.323
Judge, looking good.

23:32.323 --> 23:35.631
Yeah, if I were at
a Renaissance fair.

23:36.893 --> 23:39.505
- Oh, Diane, look.

23:41.898 --> 23:45.032
I literally thought
that was you.

23:45.032 --> 23:47.251
- I love that.
- It's...

23:47.251 --> 23:49.863
So, what do you think?

23:49.863 --> 23:51.430
- That I don't like you.

23:52.474 --> 23:54.955
Aw.
Holy moly.

23:54.955 --> 23:56.696
- Gorgeous.
- Oh, Diane.

23:56.696 --> 23:59.481
You look more like you
than you ever have. -

23:59.481 --> 24:01.091
We are sending

24:01.091 --> 24:02.789
- a picture of this to Mitchell.

24:02.789 --> 24:05.269
No, no, no, no.
Wait a minute. Are you nuts?

24:05.269 --> 24:07.141
- Too late.
- Please don't send it.

24:07.141 --> 24:08.795
Sharon, un-send it.

24:08.795 --> 24:11.319
Just because I know
how to not make myself a potato

24:11.319 --> 24:13.452
doesn't mean I'm Steve Jobs.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.454
- I mean...

24:15.454 --> 24:17.673
Another one for the bride-to-be.

24:17.673 --> 24:19.370
Okay, I need more drink.

24:19.370 --> 24:21.024
- Oh, my God.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.680
Whoa.

24:24.680 --> 24:26.769
Whoa.
Oh, no way.

24:26.769 --> 24:29.555
Slim, yowza.

24:29.555 --> 24:31.470
Oh, my God, I'd marry you.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.863
Oh, my gosh, Viv, it's stunning.

24:35.517 --> 24:39.086
Is it how you always
imagined yourself as a bride?

24:39.086 --> 24:41.523
I never imagined myself
as a bride. -

24:41.523 --> 24:43.525
Which is funny because

24:43.525 --> 24:46.006
we always hosted weddings
at the Quinn-Henry,

24:46.006 --> 24:48.748
but I never imagined my own.

24:48.748 --> 24:49.966
Hmm.

24:53.274 --> 24:55.145
How does it feel?

24:55.145 --> 24:57.017
Mm, I love the fabric.

24:57.017 --> 24:58.758
I know.

24:58.758 --> 25:02.544
It's the finest, but...
how do you feel?

25:02.544 --> 25:05.155
Is this the right one?

25:09.029 --> 25:10.552
What do you think?

25:10.552 --> 25:12.162
It's perfect.

25:12.162 --> 25:14.295
- Yeah?
- Truly, truly stunning.

25:16.123 --> 25:17.341
We'll take it.

25:17.341 --> 25:18.647
<i>EÈ bellissima.</i>

25:18.647 --> 25:20.736
Yes.

25:21.998 --> 25:24.174
Hey! Yeah.
Here they are.

25:24.174 --> 25:26.350
Oh, what'd you get?

25:26.350 --> 25:28.439
Do you know
that Mitchell's real name

25:28.439 --> 25:29.789
is Michelangelo?

25:29.789 --> 25:31.312
Oh.
And...

25:32.661 --> 25:35.055
Arturo. It's a much sexier name
than Arthur, right?

25:35.055 --> 25:36.273
Oh.

25:36.273 --> 25:38.667
Everything is sexier in Italy.

25:38.667 --> 25:40.930
Well, I know I am.

25:40.930 --> 25:42.628
- Right, Giuseppe?
- Of course.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.589
Oh, God.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.460
Mitchell.

25:49.460 --> 25:51.332
Because you sent him
that picture.

25:51.332 --> 25:53.508
- What? Let...
What?

25:53.508 --> 25:55.554
"A true work of art.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.773
And the dress
ain't bad, either."

25:57.773 --> 26:00.254
- Oh, great line.

26:00.254 --> 26:02.430
This guy. Oh, God.

26:02.430 --> 26:03.823
Aw.

26:03.823 --> 26:05.564
- Hey, cheers.
- Hey, cheers is right.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.566
- Cheers. -Cheers.
- Here we go.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.742
Rome is a great walking city,

26:09.742 --> 26:12.614
but it's an even better
sit-down-and-drink-wine city.

26:12.614 --> 26:13.920
So true.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.443
I think you say that
about every city.

26:15.443 --> 26:17.837
What? No, e-every city
is not good for walking.

26:17.837 --> 26:19.186
Oh.

26:19.186 --> 26:20.622
The best walking city
is Venezia.

26:20.622 --> 26:24.060
Oh, I love Venice.

26:25.888 --> 26:28.674
Sh... Should we go?

26:29.631 --> 26:30.980
- To Venice?
- To...

26:30.980 --> 26:32.591
-  Of course.
- Yeah?

26:32.591 --> 26:34.549
Going to Venezia is never
the wrong decision.

26:34.549 --> 26:35.898
- Yeah.
Oh.

26:35.898 --> 26:37.465
I-I have a friend
with a great hotel there.

26:37.465 --> 26:39.467
Where do you not have
a friend with a hotel?

26:39.467 --> 26:41.295
- Well, not many places.

26:41.295 --> 26:42.818
Well, I-I think we should

26:42.818 --> 26:45.168
just stay the course
and go to Tuscany.

26:45.168 --> 26:47.997
Venice is the most special city
in the world.

26:47.997 --> 26:49.651
The treasure of Italy.

26:49.651 --> 26:52.872
-"The treasure of Italy."
Uh...

26:52.872 --> 26:56.789
Wasn't the guy in <i>The Alchemist</i>
searching for treasure?

26:56.789 --> 26:59.661
This is the universe
telling us we should go.

26:59.661 --> 27:02.925
Or is it a street artist
telling us to go?

27:02.925 --> 27:04.666
I mean, no offense, obviously.

27:04.666 --> 27:06.102
I say it's a sign.

27:06.102 --> 27:08.452
And it's my bachelorette, remember?

27:08.452 --> 27:09.758
Mm-hmm.

27:09.758 --> 27:13.370
Judge, do you maybe want
to overrule this?

27:13.370 --> 27:15.895
Nonsense.
I'm the one wearing the sash,

27:15.895 --> 27:18.680
so what I say goes.

27:18.680 --> 27:21.857
New plan: <i>Andiamo a Venezia.</i>

27:21.857 --> 27:23.424
- Uh-huh.
- Ah.

27:23.424 --> 27:26.949
Is there room in this new plan
for sleeping?

27:26.949 --> 27:29.822
Is 6:00 p.m. an appropriate
bachelorette bedtime?

27:29.822 --> 27:31.040
- Definitely.
- Really?

27:31.040 --> 27:33.260
- Very standard, actually.
- Okay.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.218
Tomorrow, we leave
early in the morning.

27:35.218 --> 27:36.655
<i>Bellissima.</i>

27:37.873 --> 27:39.701
For the beautiful woman.

27:39.701 --> 27:41.921
Oh, wow.

27:41.921 --> 27:43.749
You really are sexier in Italy.

27:43.749 --> 27:45.576
It-it's like looking
in a mirror.

27:45.576 --> 27:46.752
Yeah.

27:48.275 --> 27:49.668
Thank you.

28:02.158 --> 28:05.553
Thank you. <i>Grazie.</i> Thank you.

28:05.553 --> 28:08.861
- Let's see. Where is Venice?
- Oh, I don't...

28:08.861 --> 28:10.993
- We're going...
- Oh, wow.

28:10.993 --> 28:12.603
- Oh, hi.

28:12.603 --> 28:14.127
<i>- Prima classe?
- Siì.</i>

28:14.127 --> 28:15.345
- Yeah.
- Yeah, for sure.

28:15.345 --> 28:16.607
Yeah, first class.

28:16.607 --> 28:17.870
Where you going?

28:17.870 --> 28:19.610
- Venice.
- Ah, Venezia.

28:21.525 --> 28:23.049
We'll help you with the luggage.

28:23.049 --> 28:24.137
Allow us, please.

28:24.137 --> 28:25.268
- We'll help you.
- Thank you.

28:25.268 --> 28:27.270
- Oh.
- Yeah.

28:27.270 --> 28:29.708
Venezia. Uh, plenty of time.

28:29.708 --> 28:30.970
- Yeah.
- Oh.

28:30.970 --> 28:32.362
Well, that's very kind.

28:32.362 --> 28:34.016
Thank you.
This is for both of you.

28:34.016 --> 28:35.714
Thank you so much.

28:38.151 --> 28:39.718
- Where's Venezia?
- See it?

28:39.718 --> 28:41.371
- You see Venice?
- I can't read any of that.

28:41.371 --> 28:42.546
There's Venezia.

29:21.411 --> 29:22.978
<i>Benvenute a Venezia.</i>

29:22.978 --> 29:24.023
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

29:24.023 --> 29:25.154
<i>- Grazie.</i>
- Thank you.

29:25.154 --> 29:26.547
<i>- Prego.
- Grazie.</i>

29:26.547 --> 29:27.896
- Boy.

29:27.896 --> 29:29.202
- Come on, everybody.
- Okay. Yeah.

29:29.202 --> 29:30.507
- All right.
- Good.

29:30.507 --> 29:31.900
Diane, can you hand me my purse?

29:31.900 --> 29:33.554
Oh, wait a minute.

29:33.554 --> 29:35.164
Um, no.

29:35.164 --> 29:37.123
Oh, my God, I don't see...
It's-it's not up here.

29:38.559 --> 29:40.213
Well, where is it?

29:41.431 --> 29:42.955
Um... Oh.

29:42.955 --> 29:44.173
Everything okay?

29:44.173 --> 29:45.609
I can't find my purse.

29:45.609 --> 29:47.046
I've got mine.

29:47.046 --> 29:49.352
But now is not
the time to gloat.

29:49.352 --> 29:50.876
Do you think it was stolen?

29:50.876 --> 29:52.486
I didn't see anyone
come through.

29:52.486 --> 29:54.836
Yeah, Carol, are you sure
you put it up here?

29:54.836 --> 29:56.664
- Mm-hmm.
- I-I... I thought I did.

29:56.664 --> 29:58.274
Oh, God.

29:58.274 --> 29:59.972
Ah. Aha. Aha.

29:59.972 --> 30:01.234
Wait. Wait.

30:01.234 --> 30:03.627
Oh.
Oh.

30:03.627 --> 30:06.543
Thank you. Thank you.

30:06.543 --> 30:08.807
I was so nervous
that we'd been robbed.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.810
Uh, sir, where can we find
our checked bags?

30:11.810 --> 30:14.029
What do you mean,
"checked bags"?

30:14.029 --> 30:17.511
Oh, the ones that we gave
to the porters in Rome.

30:18.642 --> 30:21.341
I'm sorry,
but we don't have any porters.

30:23.691 --> 30:25.258
- Uh...
- Uh...

30:25.258 --> 30:28.435
Wh-When did you get rid
of the porters?

30:30.176 --> 30:32.743
1976.

30:39.054 --> 30:40.708
No wonder the porters

30:40.708 --> 30:42.666
were so surprised
when I gave them a tip.

30:42.666 --> 30:44.973
Well, it's probably
not every day

30:44.973 --> 30:47.541
that someone gives them cash
to steal their luggage.

30:47.541 --> 30:49.282
Yeah, I just can't believe this.

30:49.282 --> 30:51.850
I can't lose that bag.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.677
Well, I know
it's annoying, honey,

30:53.677 --> 30:55.462
but it's not the end
of the world.

30:55.462 --> 30:57.203
You don't understand.

30:57.203 --> 30:59.422
It might be good to get you
some fresh clothes.

30:59.422 --> 31:01.424
Everything is replaceable.

31:01.424 --> 31:03.296
No, not everything is. No.

31:03.296 --> 31:06.777
Okay, Diane, I think you're
blowing this out of proportion.

31:09.128 --> 31:11.217
Harry's ashes are in the bag.

31:14.916 --> 31:17.223
- What?! Oh, God.
Yeah.

31:17.223 --> 31:21.792
You brought Harry's ashes
to a bachelorette party?

31:21.792 --> 31:23.925
- Are you nuts?
You're the one

31:23.925 --> 31:25.971
that said I shouldn't
leave him in the closet.

31:25.971 --> 31:27.276
So you brought him to Italy?

31:27.276 --> 31:29.713
In a checked bag?

31:29.713 --> 31:32.107
- Like a serial killer.
- Is that even legal?

31:32.107 --> 31:33.413
You're asking me?

31:33.413 --> 31:34.936
- Oh, <i>buongiorno.</i>
- Oh, yes.

31:34.936 --> 31:37.286
<i>- Buongiorno.</i>
Oh, <i>buongiorno.</i>

31:37.286 --> 31:39.201
Yeah.
Hi.

31:40.376 --> 31:44.206
So, we have made the report.

31:45.120 --> 31:48.123
Okay, and, uh...

31:48.123 --> 31:51.910
If, uh, anything turns up,
we will let you know.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.129
That's it? Because we've been
sitting here for two hours,

31:54.129 --> 31:55.565
and that's all we're gonna get?

31:55.565 --> 31:59.047
No, that is not all.

31:59.047 --> 32:00.222
Uh-huh.

32:00.222 --> 32:02.659
I feel very bad for you. Please.

32:02.659 --> 32:04.618
Oh, you feel bad for us?

32:04.618 --> 32:07.273
We don't need a man
to take pity on us.

32:07.273 --> 32:10.232
No, your lazy police work
is more than sufficient.

32:10.232 --> 32:11.494
Um...

32:12.495 --> 32:13.801
I'm just curious.

32:13.801 --> 32:16.673
Hypothetically,
if you do find the bags,

32:16.673 --> 32:19.067
will you be going through them?

32:19.067 --> 32:21.417
I don't typically
make it a habit...

32:21.417 --> 32:22.723
Oh.

32:22.723 --> 32:24.029
...to go through
a lady's belongings.

32:24.029 --> 32:26.118
Oh, that's great. Okay, good.

32:26.118 --> 32:28.294
All right.
And thanks again. Thank you.

32:31.036 --> 32:32.602
Wait, signora.

32:33.864 --> 32:35.127
Your dress.

32:35.127 --> 32:37.042
Oh. Oh, God. Shoot. Yes.

32:37.042 --> 32:38.869
That's my dress.
Thank you so much.

32:38.869 --> 32:40.349
Are you here for a wedding?

32:40.349 --> 32:42.786
No, it-it's a bachelorette trip,

32:42.786 --> 32:45.093
but my friends took me
dress shopping in Rome.

32:45.093 --> 32:47.095
- Such nice friends you have.
-  Yes.

32:47.095 --> 32:48.444
Even the critical one.

32:50.185 --> 32:51.882
Yeah, well...

32:51.882 --> 32:53.667
<i>Signora, per favore.</i>

32:53.667 --> 32:54.885
Before you go.

32:55.843 --> 32:57.453
Take this.

32:57.453 --> 33:00.369
So we don't have to see
each other again.

33:00.369 --> 33:01.980
Well, thanks.

33:01.980 --> 33:06.114
This is tremendously helpful
at this point.

33:08.290 --> 33:11.554
Well, it's definitely not legal.

33:11.554 --> 33:14.296
- That's for sure.
- What were you thinking?

33:14.296 --> 33:16.211
I was just trying to do
a nice thing.

33:16.211 --> 33:18.909
I mean, he always wanted
to visit Italy.

33:18.909 --> 33:20.781
- Aw.
- It's a sweet idea.

33:20.781 --> 33:23.088
- Thanks.
- Also crazy.

33:23.088 --> 33:25.264
Yeah, I can see that now.

33:25.264 --> 33:28.006
On the bright side,
it's much easier walking

33:28.006 --> 33:30.051
without dragging your luggage.

33:30.051 --> 33:32.053
Speak for yourself.

33:32.053 --> 33:33.663
This is like a...

33:33.663 --> 33:36.710
a full upper-body routine
carrying this thing.

33:37.798 --> 33:40.018
So, remember
that part in <i>The Alchemist</i>

33:40.018 --> 33:42.890
where the guy gets robbed
and loses everything?

33:42.890 --> 33:44.196
Yeah.

33:44.196 --> 33:46.024
I have no empathy for him
at this point.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.416
Yeah, neither do I.

33:47.416 --> 33:49.331
Well, he said he had
a choice to make.

33:49.331 --> 33:51.986
He could either see himself
as a victim of a thief...

33:51.986 --> 33:54.032
Or see himself as an adventurer

33:54.032 --> 33:55.511
in search of a treasure.

33:55.511 --> 33:57.296
Yeah, but we are victims
of a thief.

33:57.296 --> 34:00.125
But we are also adventurers.

34:51.176 --> 34:53.047
Ciao, Sofia.

34:53.047 --> 34:55.354
Ciao. Ciao.

34:55.354 --> 34:57.095
Welcome back.

34:57.095 --> 35:00.489
Ladies, let me assure you,
you're in good hands now.

35:00.489 --> 35:02.970
There is nothing my uncle
wouldn't do for this woman.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.928
- Oh, that's very sweet.
- Well, it's true.

35:04.928 --> 35:06.669
And you're in luck
because the wedding

35:06.669 --> 35:09.107
we were supposed to throw
this weekend canceled,

35:09.107 --> 35:11.370
so our best rooms are available.

35:11.370 --> 35:13.633
The wedding was canceled?

35:13.633 --> 35:15.896
Yeah. It was very dramatic.

35:15.896 --> 35:19.508
Screaming and crying,
and the dress on fire.

35:19.508 --> 35:20.988
- Oh.
- Yeah.

35:20.988 --> 35:22.337
But this is our boutique.

35:22.337 --> 35:24.600
I've let them know
to expect you.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.081
I've got the same thing in blue.

35:27.081 --> 35:28.648
- Oh.

35:29.823 --> 35:31.172
Here are your keys.

35:31.172 --> 35:32.608
I'm sure you're exhausted.

35:32.608 --> 35:34.262
Thank you.

35:34.262 --> 35:36.656
When you see your uncle,
please give him my very best.

35:36.656 --> 35:38.266
Of course.

35:38.266 --> 35:39.963
And please, if there is
anything else you need,

35:39.963 --> 35:41.443
- don't hesitate to ask.
Thank you.

35:41.443 --> 35:42.662
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

35:42.662 --> 35:43.837
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

35:43.837 --> 35:45.186
Yeah.

35:45.186 --> 35:47.145
Nothing her uncle
wouldn't do for you, huh?

35:47.145 --> 35:49.495
Well, there was a time
15 years ago

35:49.495 --> 35:52.324
when there was nothing
I wouldn't have done for him...

35:52.324 --> 35:54.021
sexually.

35:54.021 --> 35:55.892
Well, thank you for clarifying.

35:55.892 --> 35:58.417
Well, if you must know,
he's why I got my knee replaced.

35:58.417 --> 36:00.549
- Oh, boy.
- Such commitment.

36:00.549 --> 36:02.290
Such sacrifice.

36:02.290 --> 36:04.553
Mm, she's a modern-day
Mother Teresa.

36:04.553 --> 36:06.599
That's the part
of Mother Teresa's story

36:06.599 --> 36:08.688
they don't tell you about.

36:08.688 --> 36:10.690
<i>She wasn't just
on her knees praying.</i>

36:10.690 --> 36:13.345
<i>Oh.</i>

36:19.002 --> 36:21.004
To help you forget
about your troubles.

36:21.004 --> 36:22.919
<i>Salute.</i>

36:22.919 --> 36:25.531
It won't hurt.

36:25.531 --> 36:27.576
Forgive me,
I-I couldn't help but overhear.

36:27.576 --> 36:31.276
What sort of troubles
have you got yourself into?

36:31.276 --> 36:33.365
Oh.

36:33.365 --> 36:36.542
A little snafu
at the train station.

36:36.542 --> 36:39.066
My friends and I
had our luggage stolen.

36:40.241 --> 36:43.070
Well, that sounds like
more than a little snafu.

36:43.070 --> 36:44.419
All your luggage?

36:44.419 --> 36:45.899
Wallets? Passport?

36:45.899 --> 36:47.248
Oh, please.

36:47.248 --> 36:50.077
What kind of fool
do you take me for?

36:55.735 --> 36:57.171
Fantastic.

36:57.171 --> 36:59.869
No one could get this off me.
No one.

36:59.869 --> 37:01.175
Oh.

37:01.175 --> 37:03.960
It would require
very nimble fingers,

37:03.960 --> 37:05.788
I imagine.

37:08.051 --> 37:10.663
Well, since we're playing
"you show me yours,

37:10.663 --> 37:12.795
I'll show you mine."

37:15.320 --> 37:18.366
Be still my heart.

37:23.241 --> 37:26.461
No, I'm just saying you need
to keep stress to a minimum.

37:26.461 --> 37:28.071
I'm at a driving range.

37:28.071 --> 37:31.379
That's just a bit more strenuous
than taking a nap.

37:31.379 --> 37:33.338
Sweetheart, listen, are you sure

37:33.338 --> 37:35.427
that I shouldn't come over
and meet up with you?

37:35.427 --> 37:37.429
We discussed this, Bruce.

37:37.429 --> 37:39.605
It's-it's not safe.

37:39.605 --> 37:41.955
Yeah, I know. I was just
thinking that, you know...

37:41.955 --> 37:44.436
So, tomorrow,
we're going to La Toscana.

37:44.436 --> 37:45.915
La Toscana?

37:45.915 --> 37:48.309
- That's how you say Tuscany.
- Oh, oh.

37:48.309 --> 37:50.268
I thought you were talking
about the restaurant

37:50.268 --> 37:52.052
on San Vicente.

37:52.052 --> 37:55.838
Why would I be talking about
a restaurant on San Vicente

37:55.838 --> 37:57.318
when I'm in Italy?

37:57.318 --> 37:59.277
- Eataly?
- What?

37:59.277 --> 38:00.800
Eataly.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.758
The restaurant in Century City.

38:02.758 --> 38:04.325
I'm just making restaurant jokes

38:04.325 --> 38:06.849
because, uh, I'm on
such a strict diet, honey.

38:06.849 --> 38:08.938
Okay. Okay, I get it now.

38:08.938 --> 38:11.376
Yeah, well, if I got to explain
the jokes, Carol,

38:11.376 --> 38:13.595
it's just not as funny.

38:13.595 --> 38:17.077
How about we just cool it with
the jokes about restaurants?

38:17.077 --> 38:20.036
You don't hear me making jokes
about angioplasty.

38:20.036 --> 38:21.864
Oh, gosh, I wish you would.

38:22.822 --> 38:24.998
- A bachelorette trip?
- Yes.

38:24.998 --> 38:27.043
I don't think
I know anyone who's done

38:27.043 --> 38:29.350
anything like that for 20 years.

38:29.350 --> 38:32.353
And why not, right?

38:32.353 --> 38:36.357
Honestly, this is
how I want to live my life.

38:36.357 --> 38:38.054
On a bachelorette trip?

38:38.054 --> 38:39.752
- Of course.

38:39.752 --> 38:43.799
And guided by
the daily practice of "why not?"

38:43.799 --> 38:45.671
For a second,
I thought you said,

38:45.671 --> 38:47.803
"Guided by
the daily practice of wine,"

38:47.803 --> 38:49.718
and I thought, "Okay."

38:49.718 --> 38:51.503
Well, it's not
a bad combination.

38:51.503 --> 38:54.070
"Wine and 'Why Not?'"

38:54.070 --> 38:56.943
That's gonna be
the title of my autobiography.

38:56.943 --> 39:00.555
Well, I promise that
I shall buy a first edition.

39:00.555 --> 39:02.731
You're on.

39:02.731 --> 39:04.733
Oh, my God. Look at her.

39:04.733 --> 39:06.996
We can't leave her alone
for a second.

39:06.996 --> 39:09.216
Yeah, they're like
moths to a flame.

39:09.216 --> 39:10.739
Oh. Ciao, guys.

39:10.739 --> 39:12.698
Oh, hi.

39:13.655 --> 39:15.222
<i>- Buonasera.</i>
- Hey. -Hi.

39:15.222 --> 39:16.876
- Whoo!

39:16.876 --> 39:18.225
This is Ousmane.

39:18.225 --> 39:19.618
- Uh-huh.
- Ciao.

39:19.618 --> 39:21.010
It's really very nice
to meet you.

39:21.010 --> 39:24.187
Which one of you
is the bride-to-be?

39:24.187 --> 39:26.364
- Oh, definitely not me.
- Oh, no.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.887
She'll be down in just a minute.

39:27.887 --> 39:30.368
It must be very exciting
for all of you.

39:30.368 --> 39:32.805
And I'm delighted that
you'll be joining us tonight.

39:32.805 --> 39:34.241
- Tonight?
- Uh, yes.

39:34.241 --> 39:36.243
I-I made dinner plans
for us tonight.

39:36.243 --> 39:37.853
- Oh.
- Great.

39:37.853 --> 39:40.203
It's going to be...
Wh-What did you call it?

39:40.203 --> 39:42.684
"An authentic
Italian experience"?

39:42.684 --> 39:44.904
Wait a minute. Are we going
to the Olive Garden?

39:44.904 --> 39:46.296
- Oh, I'm sorry.

39:46.296 --> 39:47.994
I promise you it'll be worth it.

39:47.994 --> 39:50.344
It's great food, great people.

39:50.344 --> 39:54.043
And there's no problem if
four random women show up? -Mm.

39:54.043 --> 39:56.132
This is Italy.

39:56.132 --> 39:59.832
There's always room
for random beautiful women.

39:59.832 --> 40:01.964
- Oh. -
- He's good.

40:01.964 --> 40:04.445
" playing on piano]

41:17.475 --> 41:20.434
- Look at this!

41:20.434 --> 41:22.784
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

41:22.784 --> 41:24.569
You pulled together
this bachelorette dinner

41:24.569 --> 41:26.266
in-in-in record time.

41:26.266 --> 41:28.268
It was easier than you think.

41:28.268 --> 41:31.271
And we even got you a band.

41:31.271 --> 41:32.577
Look!

41:32.577 --> 41:34.535
Hope you like Italian music.

41:38.060 --> 41:39.671
Hey.

41:39.671 --> 41:42.195
So we decided to go
into the jewelry store,

41:42.195 --> 41:45.198
and before we knew it,
we were engaged.

41:45.198 --> 41:47.853
Well, I think that's
incredibly romantic.

41:47.853 --> 41:49.289
Well, thank you.

41:49.289 --> 41:51.117
- Are you married?
- No.

41:51.117 --> 41:54.250
- I-I've traveled that road.

41:54.250 --> 41:55.861
Not a pleasant journey?

41:55.861 --> 41:58.341
Well, it was a bit
of a carjacking, really.

41:58.341 --> 42:00.474
- Hmm.
- Oh.

42:00.474 --> 42:02.432
Well, um, it wasn't all bad.

42:02.432 --> 42:04.870
Uh, are you all married?

42:04.870 --> 42:06.480
Married.

42:06.480 --> 42:08.177
Not married but not single.

42:08.177 --> 42:09.918
- Ah. Dating.
- Yeah.

42:09.918 --> 42:11.572
Serious boyfriend.

42:11.572 --> 42:13.008
Yeah, I mean...

42:13.008 --> 42:14.357
I don't know,
"boyfriend and girlfriend"

42:14.357 --> 42:15.968
just sounds so silly, you know?

42:15.968 --> 42:17.360
Like we're in high school
or something.

42:17.360 --> 42:19.319
I'm too old to be
somebody's girlfriend.

42:19.319 --> 42:20.929
Are you kidding?

42:20.929 --> 42:23.497
Oh, being a girlfriend is
the greatest thing in the world.

42:23.497 --> 42:25.630
- That's not true.
- Oh, it is.

42:25.630 --> 42:28.110
Being a girlfriend is sexy.

42:28.110 --> 42:29.459
It's exciting.

42:29.459 --> 42:30.678
You know, it means
you love somebody

42:30.678 --> 42:31.984
and you're committed to them,

42:31.984 --> 42:34.247
but you still have
your own life.

42:34.247 --> 42:37.685
You haven't given yourself up
to society's conventions.

42:37.685 --> 42:38.817
It's all about choice.

42:38.817 --> 42:41.297
You choose to be there,

42:41.297 --> 42:44.213
but you can leave
any time you damn well please.

42:44.213 --> 42:45.432
Perfect.

42:45.432 --> 42:46.868
And you're the bride-to-be?

42:50.393 --> 42:51.656
And what about you?

42:52.657 --> 42:54.093
Oh, she's the single one.

42:54.093 --> 42:56.095
Oh, well, every group needs one.

42:57.226 --> 42:59.664
And I'm the one who has to run
to the ladies' room,

42:59.664 --> 43:01.187
if you'll excuse me.

43:01.187 --> 43:03.624
Ousmane,
what do you do in Italy?

43:03.624 --> 43:05.104
Philosophy.

43:05.104 --> 43:08.107
No, I-I was
a professor of philosophy.

43:08.107 --> 43:09.978
Happily now retired.

43:09.978 --> 43:13.025
Which is why I have
so much time to spend here.

43:13.025 --> 43:15.505
- Ciao.
- Ciao, chef.

43:19.422 --> 43:21.816
<i>...Sharon, Diane e Vivian.</i>

43:21.816 --> 43:23.949
You're so kind to include us.

43:24.906 --> 43:26.473
It is my sincerest joy.

43:26.473 --> 43:32.044
So, let us proceed
with <i>un po' di prosecco.</i>

43:32.044 --> 43:34.263
It, uh, prepares the palate.

43:34.263 --> 43:36.091
Oh, thank you.

43:36.091 --> 43:37.702
<i>- Prego.</i>
- Yeah.

43:37.702 --> 43:39.486
What brings you to Venice?

43:39.486 --> 43:43.229
Oh, uh, a series of, well,
unanticipated events, so...

43:43.229 --> 43:46.101
- Ah. The spice of life.
- Oh. Thanks.

43:46.101 --> 43:48.103
I got a little lost.

43:48.103 --> 43:49.931
Wow.

43:49.931 --> 43:51.672
That's quite a situation
in the bosom area.

43:51.672 --> 43:53.500
- Oh! <i>Scusi.</i>
- Yeah.

43:53.500 --> 43:56.329
- Oh. I overdid it, didn't I?
Oh, no, that's okay.

43:56.329 --> 43:57.635
No, absolutely not.

44:01.813 --> 44:03.118
Wait.

44:04.076 --> 44:05.817
Carolina.

44:05.817 --> 44:07.427

44:07.427 --> 44:09.647
- Gianni, is that you?
<i>- Siì.</i>

44:09.647 --> 44:11.779
<i>- Siì, si.</i>

44:11.779 --> 44:13.302
This is crazy.

44:13.302 --> 44:15.130
What are you doing here?

44:15.130 --> 44:16.741
Me? Well, I live here.

44:16.741 --> 44:18.525
This is my cooking school.

44:18.525 --> 44:21.571
Oh. Wait, wait.
You mean Gi-Gianni?

44:21.571 --> 44:23.661
Gi-Gianni, Gianni?

44:23.661 --> 44:24.966
It's the Gianni.

44:24.966 --> 44:26.576
Not fat or bald.

44:26.576 --> 44:28.274
This is crazy. -I've heard
about your meatballs.

44:28.274 --> 44:29.754
I-I can't believe.

44:29.754 --> 44:31.538
I mean, look at you, huh?

44:31.538 --> 44:32.974
Oh.

44:32.974 --> 44:35.020
Yeah, I mean,
this is a new dress,

44:35.020 --> 44:37.109
and it's a little... probably
a little much for tonight,

44:37.109 --> 44:38.937
but I just wanted
to have a little fun.

44:38.937 --> 44:40.678
You look beautiful.

44:40.678 --> 44:42.680
- Thank you.
My goodness.

44:42.680 --> 44:45.117
Thank you. This is incredible.

44:45.117 --> 44:46.814
- Wow.
Wow.

44:46.814 --> 44:48.555
Yes. Oh, <i>grazie.</i>

44:48.555 --> 44:50.775
Uh, and here to start,
an amuse-bouche.

44:50.775 --> 44:52.254
- Oh.
I think somebody's

44:52.254 --> 44:54.343
bouche is already quite amused.

44:54.343 --> 44:56.258
Enjoy, please. I need to, uh...

44:57.259 --> 44:58.826
My head is spinning.

44:58.826 --> 45:01.089
There's so many things
I want to put in your mouth.

45:01.089 --> 45:02.743
- I can't wait.
- Oh.

45:02.743 --> 45:05.920
And I mustn't overheat
your cacciucco. Uh, e-excuse me.

45:05.920 --> 45:07.835
- May be a little late for that.

45:07.835 --> 45:09.576
Even my cacciucco is overheated.

45:09.576 --> 45:11.404
- So is mine.

45:13.319 --> 45:15.277
- Oh, that was the best meal.
- So delicious.

45:15.277 --> 45:16.539
No, no. Uh...

45:16.539 --> 45:17.976
I can't even believe it.

45:17.976 --> 45:19.629
What are the chances?

45:19.629 --> 45:22.415
If I were writing a book,
I'd have you sleep with him

45:22.415 --> 45:24.286
just to get the recipe
for this sauce.

45:24.286 --> 45:25.679
- Ooh.

45:25.679 --> 45:27.507
Libations.

45:27.507 --> 45:28.769
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

45:28.769 --> 45:30.118
I think I've had enough.

45:30.118 --> 45:33.774
Oh, come on.
This is your bachelorette,

45:33.774 --> 45:37.299
and things are about to get
even more fun.

45:39.432 --> 45:40.955
Ooh!

45:40.955 --> 45:42.783
- Oh.

45:42.783 --> 45:45.177
Goodness.
- Oh, fun.

45:45.177 --> 45:46.744
Right?

45:46.744 --> 45:48.615
- Very Christian Grey.

45:54.099 --> 45:55.317
Hey.

46:03.369 --> 46:05.806
♪ Gloria

46:08.243 --> 46:09.941
Can you believe this?

46:11.159 --> 46:14.249
I told you
we should come to Italy.

46:31.876 --> 46:34.139

You go!

47:19.924 --> 47:21.708
Whoo!

47:33.938 --> 47:36.723
Oh, well, that was a first.

47:36.723 --> 47:39.813
I was thinking of taking
a little stroll

47:39.813 --> 47:42.947
down by the docks,
if you're interested.

47:42.947 --> 47:45.427
It-it might be getting
very near my bedtime.

47:47.212 --> 47:50.171
You seem a little too old
to have a bedtime.

47:50.171 --> 47:52.870
Well, let's just agree
that that was a compliment.

47:52.870 --> 47:55.742
That would be helpful.
Thank you.

47:55.742 --> 47:57.483
Shall we?

47:59.441 --> 48:00.573
And there goes Sharon.

48:00.573 --> 48:02.314
- Oh...

48:02.314 --> 48:03.924
<i>Scusi, signora.</i>
Chef Gianni says,

48:03.924 --> 48:06.927
if you would like,
you should see his <i>cucina.</i>

48:07.885 --> 48:09.974
I'm sorry, see his <i>cucina?</i>

48:09.974 --> 48:11.889
Yeah. It means kitchen.

48:11.889 --> 48:12.933
Oh.

48:12.933 --> 48:15.370
I bet it's big, isn't it?

48:15.370 --> 48:17.416
- I mean, it's a cooking school.
- Uh-huh.

48:17.416 --> 48:20.941
<i>Bene.</i> Uh, please, he says
you come whenever you'd like.

48:20.941 --> 48:23.074
Oh, that's so sweet.

48:23.074 --> 48:26.077
You tell Chef Gianni
she'd be excited to come.

48:26.077 --> 48:27.339
<i>Bene.</i>

48:27.339 --> 48:28.557
Preferably more than once.

48:28.557 --> 48:30.168
Oh, good God.

48:30.168 --> 48:32.779
You know what,
are you...

48:33.693 --> 48:36.957
I do want to see his <i>cucina.</i>

48:36.957 --> 48:39.438
Well, just go.

48:39.438 --> 48:42.223
Yes. -But don't do anything
I would do.

48:42.223 --> 48:44.530
I think that's actually
really good advice.

48:44.530 --> 48:46.575
It's just a kitchen.

48:46.575 --> 48:47.968
Oh.

48:47.968 --> 48:50.144
- Whoa.
- Yeah, sure.

48:52.190 --> 48:53.931
And then there were two.

48:53.931 --> 48:55.584
- Yeah.
- Ooh.

48:55.584 --> 48:56.934
Agatha Christie.

48:56.934 --> 48:58.761
Oh. Indeed.

49:02.635 --> 49:05.551
Oh, whoa.
Oh, boy.

49:05.551 --> 49:07.553
What a day we've had, huh?

49:07.553 --> 49:09.903
- I mean, this...
- I know.

49:09.903 --> 49:11.557
The lost luggage.

49:11.557 --> 49:14.777
Who loses a person's ashes?

49:16.083 --> 49:17.563
I don't know,
I guess some skeletons

49:17.563 --> 49:19.782
are best left
in the closet, right?

49:19.782 --> 49:21.697
- God, I don't know.

49:21.697 --> 49:23.264
- Yeah.
- And you?

49:23.264 --> 49:24.700
Huh?

49:24.700 --> 49:26.964
Married. "Marriaged."

49:26.964 --> 49:29.662
Yeah.

49:29.662 --> 49:31.490
My...

49:31.490 --> 49:36.974
My solo act is finally
coming to a close.

49:36.974 --> 49:38.976
It's crazy.

49:38.976 --> 49:41.282
- Especially for me.
- Yeah.

49:41.282 --> 49:43.154
I mean, I know it is.

49:43.154 --> 49:45.504
- No, come on. Who am I to judge?

49:45.504 --> 49:48.028
Uh, but, yeah,
I thought so at first.

49:48.028 --> 49:50.596
But, you know,
I think what you're doing

49:50.596 --> 49:52.728
is freaking incredible.

49:52.728 --> 49:55.296
And I'm genuinely excited
for you.

49:55.296 --> 49:57.081
You're drunk.

49:57.081 --> 49:59.866
No. No, I'm being serious.

49:59.866 --> 50:02.434
Well, I'm... Okay,
so maybe a little. I mean...

50:02.434 --> 50:03.913
But I'm still serious.

50:03.913 --> 50:05.263
I don't know how you do it.

50:05.263 --> 50:08.048
You tore up
the instruction manual,

50:08.048 --> 50:10.094
and you just
never even looked back.

50:10.094 --> 50:12.400
I mean, you're
the bravest person I know.

50:12.400 --> 50:16.622
And I'm so happy
that you're my friend.

50:16.622 --> 50:18.928
Oh, God.
You're definitely drunk.

50:18.928 --> 50:21.453
You can't even take
a compliment, can you?

50:21.453 --> 50:22.845
No.

50:22.845 --> 50:24.543
But it's true.

50:24.543 --> 50:27.285
I'd never have the guts
to do what you're doing.

50:27.285 --> 50:28.677
Well, I appreciate it.

50:31.637 --> 50:33.769
- I do. I appreciate it.
- You do.

50:33.769 --> 50:35.380
Thank you.

50:35.380 --> 50:37.077
Hey, we're having
a fun trip, aren't we?

50:37.077 --> 50:40.428
Oh. If you hadn't
gotten engaged,

50:40.428 --> 50:43.953
I'm not sure I would have
ever experienced Italy.

50:44.911 --> 50:46.130
What do you think?

50:46.130 --> 50:48.741
Oh. Oh, I can't believe...

50:48.741 --> 50:50.743
I can't believe
what I almost missed.

50:51.918 --> 50:56.618
But the only question is:
How will we mess this all up?

50:58.620 --> 51:01.362
I don't know,
but if we mess it up

51:01.362 --> 51:03.190
the way we've messed up
the trip so far,

51:03.190 --> 51:05.105
I can't wait to find out.

51:05.105 --> 51:07.151
Yeah, but first...

51:07.151 --> 51:08.978
bedtime.

51:09.936 --> 51:11.459
Yeah. Yeah.

51:11.459 --> 51:13.722
- I do need my beauty sleep.
- Yeah.

51:13.722 --> 51:17.074
You know, this doesn't
just happen on its own.

51:17.074 --> 51:20.729
I imagine it's the work
of many skilled artisans.

51:20.729 --> 51:22.862
Yeah,
they're practically unionized.

51:22.862 --> 51:24.994
Okay.

51:31.262 --> 51:34.439
"Of all the gin joints
in all the towns

51:34.439 --> 51:37.616
in all the world,

<i>Casablanca.</i>

51:40.184 --> 51:42.099
Remember?

51:42.099 --> 51:43.622
I remember.

51:45.014 --> 51:48.322
You know, my first time
was with you.

51:48.322 --> 51:51.282
What? It was?

51:52.413 --> 51:54.372
The... No, I...
I mean the movie.

51:54.372 --> 51:57.201
- Seeing the movie.
- Oh.

51:57.201 --> 51:59.290
Oh.

51:59.290 --> 52:01.814
I'm not sure we ever
actually made it to the end.

52:01.814 --> 52:03.816
My favorite part. I mean...

52:03.816 --> 52:06.210
Not-not the end.
The not making it to...

52:06.210 --> 52:08.081
I-I knew what you meant
that time.

52:09.474 --> 52:13.173
Okay, you're going to have
to explain something to me.

52:13.173 --> 52:15.828
- Mm-hmm.
- You live in a place

52:15.828 --> 52:17.786
where there are no roads,

52:17.786 --> 52:22.965
but you have a van
in your kitchen?

52:23.923 --> 52:25.533
Uh, <i>siì.</i>

52:25.533 --> 52:27.622
Makes no sense.

52:29.668 --> 52:32.192
That's what makes it so special.

52:34.107 --> 52:36.849
I thought it would make me
want to go somewhere.

52:36.849 --> 52:39.895
But no,
only made me happy to stay.

52:41.549 --> 52:44.073
- I get it.
- Mm.

52:47.642 --> 52:52.125
This place is
absolutely beautiful.

52:52.125 --> 52:53.866
<i>Grazie.</i>

53:00.612 --> 53:04.355
You must, too,
still be a chef, <i>siì?</i>

53:05.269 --> 53:07.227
<i>- Siì.</i>
- Ah.

53:07.227 --> 53:09.403
I can tell.

53:10.404 --> 53:12.145
- Oh, yeah? You can?
- Mm-hmm.

53:12.145 --> 53:14.843
<i>Assolutamente, siì.</i> Your aura.

53:14.843 --> 53:17.498
In the <i>cucina,</i>
everything is now.

53:17.498 --> 53:19.065
Present time.

53:19.065 --> 53:21.285
I see you understand this.

53:21.285 --> 53:25.724
Not worrying about, uh, yesterday,

53:25.724 --> 53:27.682
tomorrow.

53:27.682 --> 53:29.293
Grappa.

53:32.078 --> 53:34.602
It's about living well
for today.

53:48.181 --> 53:50.923
<i>- Salute.
- Salute.</i>

53:56.842 --> 53:59.627
- Mmm.
<i>- A tavola non si invecchia.</i>

53:59.627 --> 54:02.282
It means, "At the table, one..."

54:02.282 --> 54:04.632
"One does not grow old."

54:05.590 --> 54:07.244
You know this saying?

54:07.244 --> 54:10.334
I actually had that
on the wall of my restaurant.

54:10.334 --> 54:12.423
Oh. Really?

54:13.380 --> 54:15.208
It's a sign.

54:21.345 --> 54:23.564
No one smiles like you.

54:24.826 --> 54:26.915
I always remembered this.

54:34.706 --> 54:37.274
Uh, <i>per favore,</i> will you, uh...

54:37.274 --> 54:39.319
- Oh, <i>s... siì, si.</i>
- ...take a picture?

54:39.319 --> 54:41.843
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- Prego.</i>

54:51.940 --> 54:53.942
<i>Quanto sei bella.</i>

54:55.683 --> 54:58.207
You don't look so bad
yourself, Gianni.

55:01.472 --> 55:04.170
So, how long you are
in Venezia, Carolina?

55:06.128 --> 55:08.348
Sadly, we are leaving tomorrow.

55:08.348 --> 55:09.915
Ah.

55:11.395 --> 55:16.574
So, uh, we better take
advantage of tonight, really.

55:37.421 --> 55:39.510
Let me know when you get tired.

55:39.510 --> 55:42.382
Oh, I can do this all night.

55:42.382 --> 55:44.950
Mamma mia.

56:03.838 --> 56:04.970
Don't move.

56:06.406 --> 56:07.929
What are you doing?

56:09.453 --> 56:10.976
That would be me.

56:10.976 --> 56:13.544
Ah, Signora Bridesmaid.

56:13.544 --> 56:15.372
Oh, shit.

56:15.372 --> 56:17.678
You're in the middle
of the canal.

56:17.678 --> 56:19.332
Wow.

56:19.332 --> 56:20.812
Look at us.

56:20.812 --> 56:24.032
For the record,
that thing I said earlier

56:24.032 --> 56:26.905
about your being lazy,

56:26.905 --> 56:28.472
I'd like to take it back.

56:28.472 --> 56:30.648
Hmm.

56:30.648 --> 56:33.085
You called him lazy?
Wh-Why would you do that?

56:33.085 --> 56:35.174
Believe it or not,
I didn't anticipate

56:35.174 --> 56:37.481
running into him again.

56:39.700 --> 56:43.312
Um, perhaps we could
trouble you for a tow.

56:44.488 --> 56:48.056
Perhaps the signora
can swim you back to shore.

56:50.015 --> 56:52.974
See how lazy he is?

56:52.974 --> 56:54.715
I heard you.

57:15.344 --> 57:17.216
Good night?

57:18.609 --> 57:20.393
Don't ask.

57:23.527 --> 57:25.529
You?

57:25.529 --> 57:28.053
Same.

57:31.360 --> 57:33.972
We made pasta.

57:33.972 --> 57:36.235
In a van.

57:36.235 --> 57:40.935
I made pasta in a boat.

57:48.856 --> 57:50.292
Hey.

57:50.292 --> 57:52.947
Last night was really fun,
wasn't it?

57:52.947 --> 57:55.515
I need a minute.

57:55.515 --> 57:57.299
Well, there you go.

57:57.299 --> 57:58.779
Look who's awake.

57:58.779 --> 58:00.564
Good morning.

58:01.521 --> 58:02.653
What happened?

58:02.653 --> 58:04.045
Oh, boy.

58:04.045 --> 58:06.091
Sharon's probably
even worse off.

58:06.091 --> 58:08.485
<i>- Buongiorno.</i>
- Oh.

58:10.138 --> 58:12.619
Ooh. Biscotti.

58:12.619 --> 58:14.665
Oh, well, look who's
very chipper this morning.

58:14.665 --> 58:16.188
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

58:16.188 --> 58:20.975
Well, my Halo says
my sleep score was 96.

58:20.975 --> 58:22.455
Ah.

58:22.455 --> 58:25.153
Everyone needs
to stop screaming.

58:26.285 --> 58:27.634
Aw.
Oh.

58:27.634 --> 58:29.593
Hey, what about
if we shift our plans

58:29.593 --> 58:31.899
and-and stayed
another night here?

58:31.899 --> 58:33.074
- No.
No.

58:33.074 --> 58:35.033
Whoa. All right. Wow.

58:35.033 --> 58:37.601
Time to get to Tuscany, huh?

58:37.601 --> 58:40.081
So we... Do we just get back
on the train?

58:40.081 --> 58:42.127
Oh, forget the train.

58:42.127 --> 58:44.433
We got robbed on the train.

58:44.433 --> 58:46.958
Technically, we got robbed
in the train station.

58:46.958 --> 58:49.134
Technically,
we gave our things away

58:49.134 --> 58:51.528
- in the train station.

58:51.528 --> 58:53.834
<i>- Caffè, signore?</i>
Oh, yes. -Me.

58:53.834 --> 58:55.619
Thank you.

59:59.639 --> 01:00:01.075
Thought we hit something.

01:00:01.075 --> 01:00:02.903
No, no, no, no,
you don't understand.

01:00:02.903 --> 01:00:05.602
He sent a bunch of photos of us
from last night.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.299
So?

01:00:07.299 --> 01:00:10.128
Are we talking, like,
the nudie type pictures or...

01:00:10.128 --> 01:00:12.304
- Are you nuts? No.
- Well...

01:00:12.304 --> 01:00:14.480
But Bruce is gonna see these.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.265
It goes to my iPad.

01:00:17.265 --> 01:00:19.746
Oh, God!

01:00:19.746 --> 01:00:21.182
- No.
- What?

01:00:21.182 --> 01:00:23.750
He... His crazy broken English.

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:26.144
Gianni wrote...

01:00:26.144 --> 01:00:29.234
how nice it was
for me to rub his dough.

01:00:29.234 --> 01:00:30.975
Oh, my God.

01:00:30.975 --> 01:00:33.368
And-and that it was a very
happy ending to his night.

01:00:33.368 --> 01:00:34.631
- Oh, God.

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:36.415
- Yowza.
- Oh, that's terrible.

01:00:36.415 --> 01:00:38.809
- Oh, man. Shit, shit, shit.
- Oh, my God, I love it. More.

01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:40.811
Got to call Bruce.

01:00:43.727 --> 01:00:45.729
Why isn't it ringing?

01:00:47.469 --> 01:00:50.211
- Still not going through.
Oh.

01:00:50.211 --> 01:00:52.170
It was all innocent, right?

01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:53.650
Well, yes.

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:57.131
I mean, we flirted,
but I didn't...

01:00:57.131 --> 01:00:58.698
Rub his dough?

01:00:58.698 --> 01:00:59.743
Uh...

01:00:59.743 --> 01:01:01.179
- No.

01:01:01.179 --> 01:01:02.702
Well, how about his meatballs?

01:01:02.702 --> 01:01:04.704
-  I'm serious.
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:01:04.704 --> 01:01:06.619
But did you want to?

01:01:06.619 --> 01:01:07.968
No.

01:01:07.968 --> 01:01:11.189
I just was trying to have
a little fun.

01:01:11.189 --> 01:01:15.367
You know, I-I can't have fun
like that with Bruce around.

01:01:15.367 --> 01:01:16.585
Obviously not.

01:01:16.585 --> 01:01:18.544
No. Not like that.

01:01:18.544 --> 01:01:20.981
- Okay, sorry.
- Oh, what... like what, then?

01:01:22.287 --> 01:01:24.245
Like where I don't
have to be afraid

01:01:24.245 --> 01:01:27.379
that my husband's gonna
drop dead any second.

01:01:28.467 --> 01:01:29.642
Mmm.

01:01:29.642 --> 01:01:31.644
I-I just... What would it be?

01:01:31.644 --> 01:01:33.559
What would my life be then?

01:01:33.559 --> 01:01:35.866
It's one thing
to lose that restaurant,

01:01:35.866 --> 01:01:38.695
but I just can't lose Bruce.

01:01:40.479 --> 01:01:43.482
Okay. Best friends, tough love.

01:01:43.482 --> 01:01:45.832
You know you're
the problem, right?

01:01:46.833 --> 01:01:48.313
What are you talking about?

01:01:48.313 --> 01:01:50.663
You're just so afraid
of Bruce dying

01:01:50.663 --> 01:01:53.405
that you're stopping
the two of you from living.

01:01:55.102 --> 01:01:58.671
Seriously, he's probably
thrilled you came on this trip.

01:01:58.671 --> 01:02:01.456
The prison guard
finally left her post.

01:02:01.456 --> 01:02:03.807
He's probably
getting his first taste

01:02:03.807 --> 01:02:05.330
- of freedom, huh?
- Yeah.

01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:07.593
Let the man get
a taste of bacon.

01:02:07.593 --> 01:02:10.161
- That's not what's going on.
- Isn't it, though?

01:02:10.161 --> 01:02:13.294
That is exactly
what is going on,

01:02:13.294 --> 01:02:15.166
and you can't see it.

01:02:15.166 --> 01:02:16.776
You want the truth?

01:02:16.776 --> 01:02:19.300
"You can't handle the truth!"

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:20.998
Sorry, you set me up.

01:02:20.998 --> 01:02:24.175
The truth is, at some point,

01:02:24.175 --> 01:02:26.699
Bruce actually
might not be here.

01:02:26.699 --> 01:02:28.614
And I don't think
that anyone in this car

01:02:28.614 --> 01:02:30.355
wants to see you look back

01:02:30.355 --> 01:02:32.183
and realize all the time
you squandered

01:02:32.183 --> 01:02:34.272
because you were afraid.

01:02:34.272 --> 01:02:35.795
So knock it off.

01:02:35.795 --> 01:02:38.015
Whoa, Viv.

01:02:38.015 --> 01:02:40.626
- Mic drop.
- It's for your own good.

01:02:40.626 --> 01:02:43.672
You've got a wonderful husband
who loves you.

01:02:43.672 --> 01:02:46.850
And you're both...
you're alive and you're happy.

01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:49.853
Stop trying to control
the uncontrollables.

01:02:49.853 --> 01:02:52.290
Life is unpredictable,
and it's the surprises

01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:54.553
that make it worth living.

01:02:56.424 --> 01:02:58.949
- Oh, my God!

01:03:02.256 --> 01:03:03.823
We're okay.

01:03:03.823 --> 01:03:05.259
Everything's fine.

01:03:07.218 --> 01:03:09.829
You know, it's the surprises,
isn't it? -DIANE: Oh, God.

01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:12.092
Tell me, what kind of car
doesn't come with a spare?

01:03:12.092 --> 01:03:15.530
- That one.

01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:18.098
You know, I've never actually
hitchhiked before.

01:03:18.098 --> 01:03:20.144
Yeah, well,
in my limited experience,

01:03:20.144 --> 01:03:22.537
it helps if someone
actually drives by.

01:03:23.887 --> 01:03:25.976
- Well, on the bright side...
- Mm-hmm?

01:03:25.976 --> 01:03:27.847
...at least it's not raining.

01:03:29.153 --> 01:03:31.155
Why do you tempt fate?

01:03:31.155 --> 01:03:34.636
Well, th-there's no such thing
as fate, remember?

01:03:41.078 --> 01:03:44.298
Is it too soon to talk about
who we're gonna eat first?

01:03:45.909 --> 01:03:48.999
I think we all know.

01:03:48.999 --> 01:03:50.827
Hey.

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:52.829
This is really not good.

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:55.005
Yeah, we know.

01:03:55.005 --> 01:03:57.442
No, it's really not good.

01:03:57.442 --> 01:03:59.923
Thank you for that
brand-new information.

01:03:59.923 --> 01:04:02.447
We need to get to Tuscany.

01:04:03.709 --> 01:04:06.799
Well, yeah, but we don't need
to get panicky.

01:04:06.799 --> 01:04:09.628
You know, w-we're not
under time pressure.

01:04:09.628 --> 01:04:11.412
We can just relax. Chill.

01:04:11.412 --> 01:04:14.894
I-I am relaxed, but we really
got to start walking now.

01:04:14.894 --> 01:04:17.462
- Walk?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:04:17.462 --> 01:04:19.246
To Tuscany?

01:04:19.246 --> 01:04:21.988
Well, if we leave now,
we can be there by the morning,

01:04:21.988 --> 01:04:23.990
so let's just get it up and go.

01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:26.036
- All right, let's not get all...
No.

01:04:26.036 --> 01:04:27.994
Let's get!

01:04:27.994 --> 01:04:30.344
Because I'm done
with the not getting, okay?

01:04:30.344 --> 01:04:32.303
And this happened,
but there's still time.

01:04:32.303 --> 01:04:34.740
- We got time.
- Calm down.

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:36.742
No. We have to be in Tuscany.

01:04:36.742 --> 01:04:39.310
We're not not getting
to Tuscany, okay?

01:04:39.310 --> 01:04:42.400
Diane, seriously, calm down.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.923
I am.

01:04:43.923 --> 01:04:48.275
I'm calm, and I'm gonna
be calmer in Tuscany.

01:04:50.103 --> 01:04:51.888
What?

01:04:52.932 --> 01:04:54.978
What-what... What was this look?

01:04:54.978 --> 01:04:56.893
What the hell is going on?

01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:59.286
I-I think
we should just tell her.

01:04:59.286 --> 01:05:00.809
Tell me what?

01:05:00.809 --> 01:05:02.855
I don't think we should.

01:05:02.855 --> 01:05:04.335
Yes.

01:05:04.335 --> 01:05:06.250
- Well, we have to now.
- Yeah. Yeah, you do.

01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:08.382
You have to. What is going on?

01:05:08.382 --> 01:05:10.645
- Well...
- What?

01:05:10.645 --> 01:05:13.953
We need to get to Tuscany
because Arthur is there

01:05:13.953 --> 01:05:16.434
so that you guys
can get married tomorrow.

01:05:16.434 --> 01:05:18.958
- Excuse me?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:05:18.958 --> 01:05:21.569
He didn't want the wedding
to be a burden on you,

01:05:21.569 --> 01:05:25.008
so when he heard about
the trip, he hatched a plan.

01:05:25.008 --> 01:05:27.619
Which was actually
very thoughtful and sweet.

01:05:27.619 --> 01:05:29.360
And we're screwing
the whole thing up

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:30.970
by dying by the side
of the road.

01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:32.232
W-Wait just a minute.

01:05:32.232 --> 01:05:34.800
Arthur is in Tuscany?

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:37.281
At the hotel,
and everyone flew in,

01:05:37.281 --> 01:05:38.804
and everything is set up.

01:05:38.804 --> 01:05:40.110
It's ready to go.

01:05:40.110 --> 01:05:41.763
Y-You don't have to do anything.

01:05:41.763 --> 01:05:44.070
Except show up,
which was our job.

01:05:44.070 --> 01:05:45.854
And we're still gonna make it,

01:05:45.854 --> 01:05:48.770
because the wedding is all set
for tomorrow morning.

01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:50.816
So, surprise!

01:05:50.816 --> 01:05:52.818
Huh?

01:06:00.913 --> 01:06:02.871
She's not saying anything.

01:06:02.871 --> 01:06:04.221
Do you think she's mad?

01:06:04.221 --> 01:06:05.570
Uh, maybe a little in shock.

01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:06.788
- Viv?
- Yeah, just...

01:06:06.788 --> 01:06:08.355
Wh-What are you thinking, Slim?

01:06:08.355 --> 01:06:09.748
Huh?

01:06:10.836 --> 01:06:12.925
Fuck!

01:06:12.925 --> 01:06:14.231
At least she's talking.

01:06:14.231 --> 01:06:16.233
- Fuck!
- Oh, yikes.

01:06:16.233 --> 01:06:18.235
A surprise wedding,
and this happens.

01:06:18.235 --> 01:06:20.324
You do not see that as a sign?

01:06:20.324 --> 01:06:24.676
I mean, a big sign that
this whole thing is doomed?

01:06:24.676 --> 01:06:26.721
No. No, it's not.

01:06:26.721 --> 01:06:28.854
- We're still gonna get there.
- And that is right,

01:06:28.854 --> 01:06:30.334
because at any minute,

01:06:30.334 --> 01:06:32.292
a car's gonna come
right down that road,

01:06:32.292 --> 01:06:34.425
and we'll be on our way.

01:06:36.862 --> 01:06:38.907
Well...

01:06:38.907 --> 01:06:40.344
And if it doesn't?

01:06:40.344 --> 01:06:41.954
Because it's...

01:06:41.954 --> 01:06:44.522
feels like the world
is conspiring against me.

01:06:44.522 --> 01:06:48.743
I mean, look, maybe this really
is not meant to be, guys,

01:06:48.743 --> 01:06:50.484
and-and I just have to stop

01:06:50.484 --> 01:06:52.486
blowing past
all the warning signs.

01:06:52.486 --> 01:06:54.227
Wait, wait. Shut up for a sec.

01:06:54.227 --> 01:06:56.142
No, she's making a decent point.

01:06:56.142 --> 01:06:57.361
Thank you.

01:06:57.361 --> 01:06:58.927
Shh.

01:06:58.927 --> 01:07:00.320
Do you hear that?

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.888
- What?
- I can't... I don't...

01:07:02.888 --> 01:07:05.021
- Oh, my God. Look.
- Oh! Look!

01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:06.457
- Look. Look, look, look, look.

01:07:06.457 --> 01:07:08.111
A car!
Oh, my God.

01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:10.504
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

01:07:10.504 --> 01:07:11.897
Look alive, ladies.

01:07:11.897 --> 01:07:13.594
We've got a wedding to get to!

01:07:13.594 --> 01:07:15.422
- Don't let him drive past us.
- Oh, please, God, please.

01:07:17.163 --> 01:07:18.817
How's that for a sign?

01:07:18.817 --> 01:07:20.471
Our luck has turned.

01:07:20.471 --> 01:07:22.690
Thank God.

01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:25.215
Officer?

01:07:25.215 --> 01:07:26.868
DIANE and VIVIAN:
Oh.

01:07:26.868 --> 01:07:28.131
Whoa.

01:07:28.131 --> 01:07:29.697
DIANE, CAROL and VIVIAN:
Hi.

01:07:29.697 --> 01:07:31.047
<i>- Buonasera, signore.</i>
<i>Buonasera.</i>

01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:34.224
- What?
- Um...

01:07:34.224 --> 01:07:35.703
Oh, we-we just...

01:07:35.703 --> 01:07:37.444
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- We... Wait. Oh.

01:07:37.444 --> 01:07:39.446
Well, I...
<i>- Parlate italiano?</i>

01:07:39.446 --> 01:07:41.318
- DIANE and SHARON: Uh, no.
No.

01:07:41.318 --> 01:07:43.320
I can't believe you guys.

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:46.279
A buff cop
just happens to drive by.

01:07:46.279 --> 01:07:47.367
- Uh...
- Oh, okay.

01:07:47.367 --> 01:07:49.108
Let's go. Take your shirt off.

01:07:49.108 --> 01:07:51.502
- What? No.
- No. N-No. No, Viv.

01:07:51.502 --> 01:07:53.852
-What, you
want to start with the pants?

01:07:53.852 --> 01:07:55.332
Uh, no, no.
Oh, oh, oh.

01:07:55.332 --> 01:07:56.811
- No, y-you don't understand.
- Oh, I see.

01:07:56.811 --> 01:07:58.248
You want me to help you?

01:07:58.248 --> 01:07:59.814
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...
- No! What are you doing?

01:08:01.033 --> 01:08:02.208
No, wait. No, wait, wait.

01:08:02.208 --> 01:08:03.688
Show us your concealed weapon.

01:08:03.688 --> 01:08:05.994
- No, Viv. Viv, stop.
- I-Ignore her.

01:08:05.994 --> 01:08:08.345
- He's, um...
- This is not a stripper.

01:08:08.345 --> 01:08:09.868
Oh, yeah. Nice try.

01:08:09.868 --> 01:08:11.174
- Uh, uh, um...
- Oh!

01:08:11.174 --> 01:08:13.785
We're sorry,
but th-that's our car,

01:08:13.785 --> 01:08:17.658
and we don't have
a spare tire in it, so we...

01:08:17.658 --> 01:08:18.877
we're hitchhiking.

01:08:18.877 --> 01:08:20.487
Hitch... Ah, hitchhike.

01:08:20.487 --> 01:08:22.750
- Okay.
- Yes.

01:08:28.408 --> 01:08:31.194
It was...
it was an innocent mistake.

01:08:31.194 --> 01:08:32.978
You know, and in my defense,

01:08:32.978 --> 01:08:35.415
you guys have been
full of surprises.

01:08:35.415 --> 01:08:37.722
And come on. You saw the guy.

01:08:37.722 --> 01:08:40.942
It's been a while,
but he did have

01:08:40.942 --> 01:08:44.207
some exotic-dancer-like
qualities.

01:08:45.338 --> 01:08:47.645
I do think
he missed his calling.

01:08:49.647 --> 01:08:52.563
Well, we-we had a good run,
didn't we?

01:08:52.563 --> 01:08:54.565
Hmm.
- I mean, we just pushed past

01:08:54.565 --> 01:08:56.393
the point of common sense.

01:08:56.393 --> 01:08:58.830
Who do we think we are,
The Rolling Stones?

01:08:58.830 --> 01:09:02.355
And we just thought we'd keep
rocking forever? Ugh.

01:09:02.355 --> 01:09:04.401
This needed to happen.

01:09:04.401 --> 01:09:07.317
It did. It did.
This is the universe

01:09:07.317 --> 01:09:09.362
hitting the eject button
on me and Arthur

01:09:09.362 --> 01:09:10.842
- once and for all.
Ugh.

01:09:10.842 --> 01:09:14.889
Best friends, tough love.

01:09:14.889 --> 01:09:19.372
Stop giving the universe
and fate credit for everything.

01:09:19.372 --> 01:09:21.853
You're making a choice.

01:09:21.853 --> 01:09:23.202
What?

01:09:23.202 --> 01:09:26.466
We're on this trip
not because of fate

01:09:26.466 --> 01:09:30.775
but because we're best friends
for 50 years.

01:09:30.775 --> 01:09:32.951
We show up for each other.

01:09:32.951 --> 01:09:36.433
Fate didn't bring us
on this trip.

01:09:36.433 --> 01:09:38.217
Our love for each other did.

01:09:38.217 --> 01:09:41.046
Love and the wonderful people
at Lufthansa.

01:09:41.046 --> 01:09:43.135
It was a nice flight.

01:09:43.135 --> 01:09:46.399
You're not marrying Arthur
because of fate.

01:09:46.399 --> 01:09:50.055
You're marrying Arthur because
you put in the hard work.

01:09:50.055 --> 01:09:51.752
Because you committed to him.

01:09:51.752 --> 01:09:53.406
Because you love him.

01:09:53.406 --> 01:09:56.540
That's a big deal,
and you should be proud of that.

01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:58.716
She makes a really good point.

01:09:58.716 --> 01:10:00.718
You should definitely
listen to her.

01:10:00.718 --> 01:10:03.373
- Oh. And not you?
- Yeah.

01:10:03.373 --> 01:10:05.636
I think things are just
a little bit different for me.

01:10:05.636 --> 01:10:07.072
Oh, God.
- What?

01:10:07.072 --> 01:10:08.856
Here we go.

01:10:08.856 --> 01:10:11.119
Let me get out my tiny violin.

01:10:11.119 --> 01:10:13.034
- What?
- Hey.

01:10:13.034 --> 01:10:16.995
- Whoa.
- Best friends, tough love.

01:10:16.995 --> 01:10:18.649
You always play the victim.

01:10:18.649 --> 01:10:20.259
What are you talking about?

01:10:20.259 --> 01:10:23.393
"I'm pregnant,
so I can't do this."

01:10:23.393 --> 01:10:25.351
Or, "I'm married,
so I can't do that."

01:10:25.351 --> 01:10:27.658
"I couldn't even try that

01:10:27.658 --> 01:10:29.660
because I'm gonna fall flat
on my face."

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:32.880
You do think of excuses
not to do things.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.534
Enough. Enough.

01:10:34.534 --> 01:10:36.841
Okay, fine.

01:10:36.841 --> 01:10:38.756
Yeah, okay.

01:10:39.974 --> 01:10:41.324
What?

01:10:41.324 --> 01:10:43.630
Fine. I mean, I get it.

01:10:43.630 --> 01:10:46.024
And you're right.

01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:49.288
- Oh.
- Oh.

01:10:49.288 --> 01:10:51.247
Okay. Good.

01:10:54.859 --> 01:10:56.164
- Do me. Do my...
What?

01:10:56.164 --> 01:10:57.644
Do my tough love.

01:11:02.867 --> 01:11:06.958
Honestly, I think
you are doing just fine.

01:11:06.958 --> 01:11:10.004
Yeah. I mean, I've got nothing.

01:11:10.004 --> 01:11:13.878
You've... You made love
in a water taxi in Venice.

01:11:13.878 --> 01:11:17.055
- You've had an amazing life.

01:11:17.055 --> 01:11:18.752
Just don't get another cat.

01:11:20.014 --> 01:11:21.407
- No.
- Oy.

01:11:21.407 --> 01:11:23.322
- And there you have it.
Ah.

01:11:23.322 --> 01:11:25.629
We'll always have Venice.

01:11:25.629 --> 01:11:27.108
Is that the line?

01:11:27.108 --> 01:11:29.372
Paris.
"We'll always have Paris."

01:11:29.372 --> 01:11:31.374
It's from <i>Casablanca.</i>

01:11:31.374 --> 01:11:33.463
But Venice works, too.

01:11:35.334 --> 01:11:37.249
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

01:11:37.249 --> 01:11:39.643
A good night of sleep
will make us all

01:11:39.643 --> 01:11:41.732
feel better, I'm sure.

01:11:41.732 --> 01:11:44.343
Luckily, that's not an option.

01:11:55.833 --> 01:11:57.661
Well, well, well.

01:11:59.358 --> 01:12:02.187
Look who it is.
Signora Troublemaker.

01:12:02.187 --> 01:12:04.755
God. You again?

01:12:04.755 --> 01:12:08.193
I should say the same thing.

01:12:08.193 --> 01:12:09.803
I have some bad news.

01:12:09.803 --> 01:12:11.457
The juicer's broken,

01:12:11.457 --> 01:12:14.242
so our juice won't be
fresh-squeezed this morning?

01:12:15.461 --> 01:12:18.203
Comedy. You don't do comedy?

01:12:18.203 --> 01:12:19.726
I think you're growing on him.

01:12:19.726 --> 01:12:21.075
- Rico.
- Oh.

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:29.997
Look what he got
from Trenitalia.

01:12:31.303 --> 01:12:33.000
It was turned in
with your luggage tag.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.741
- No.
- Oh, God.

01:12:34.741 --> 01:12:37.135
You've got to be kidding me.

01:12:37.135 --> 01:12:38.441
The ashes?

01:12:38.441 --> 01:12:42.183
So, you're aware it's illegal?
Hmm?

01:12:42.183 --> 01:12:44.142
- Oh, we had a feeling.
Oh, God.

01:12:44.142 --> 01:12:46.013
This wedding is doomed.

01:12:46.013 --> 01:12:47.754
Wedding?

01:12:47.754 --> 01:12:49.887
This is a bachelorette trip, no?

01:12:49.887 --> 01:12:51.410
A surprise wedding.

01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:53.238
Her first one.

01:12:53.238 --> 01:12:55.980
Oh. I'm sorry.

01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:58.069
You don't have to be
a jerk about it.

01:12:58.069 --> 01:12:59.810
I'm not. I mean it.

01:12:59.810 --> 01:13:03.509
Although, in hindsight, I wish
I missed my first wedding.

01:13:03.509 --> 01:13:05.511
Maybe it's a blessing.

01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:07.992
No. This one was meant to be.

01:13:07.992 --> 01:13:09.950
Well, obviously not.

01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:11.474
We're destined to fail.

01:13:11.474 --> 01:13:13.214
- I'm not cut out to be married.

01:13:13.214 --> 01:13:14.955
I think we can all
agree on that.

01:13:14.955 --> 01:13:17.393
Chief, are you happy
you got to be part of the end

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:18.872
of this fairy tale
for this woman?

01:13:18.872 --> 01:13:20.570
Does that make you feel good?

01:13:21.484 --> 01:13:23.616
No, actually.

01:13:23.616 --> 01:13:25.313
But this is life.

01:13:25.313 --> 01:13:26.663
It's not fair.

01:13:26.663 --> 01:13:29.143
It doesn't always feel good.

01:13:29.143 --> 01:13:31.494
But what can I do?

01:13:31.494 --> 01:13:33.844
No one ever thinks
they can do anything.

01:13:33.844 --> 01:13:36.716
I... I'm so sick of it.

01:13:36.716 --> 01:13:39.806
Everyone always just throws up
their hand and says,

01:13:39.806 --> 01:13:41.547
"Well, it's not meant to be."

01:13:41.547 --> 01:13:42.983
It's pathetic.

01:13:42.983 --> 01:13:44.985
Y-You're a police chief.

01:13:44.985 --> 01:13:47.248
Don't tell me
you got into this work

01:13:47.248 --> 01:13:49.773
without wanting to make
a difference, did you?

01:13:49.773 --> 01:13:51.557
Didn't you think,

01:13:51.557 --> 01:13:53.124
"I'm the good guy,
I'm the hero"?

01:13:53.124 --> 01:13:54.517
Isn't that what you thought?

01:13:54.517 --> 01:13:56.214
And-and-and now what?

01:13:56.214 --> 01:13:58.782
Nothing? Now "that's life"?

01:13:58.782 --> 01:14:00.044
No.

01:14:00.044 --> 01:14:02.002
Life is what you make of it.

01:14:02.002 --> 01:14:03.482
So do something.

01:14:03.482 --> 01:14:04.918
Do something brave.

01:14:04.918 --> 01:14:08.008
Do something unexpected.

01:14:08.008 --> 01:14:09.706
But do something,

01:14:09.706 --> 01:14:11.751
because you have four women
in a jail cell

01:14:11.751 --> 01:14:15.189
who are desperately hoping
for a reason to believe

01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:18.105
there's still
a reason to believe.

01:14:21.021 --> 01:14:23.241
So do something, goddamn it,

01:14:23.241 --> 01:14:26.897
because this isn't the end
of the freaking story.

01:14:32.685 --> 01:14:34.644
I have an idea.

01:14:37.342 --> 01:14:39.387
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, you're letting us go?

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:43.914
Oh, God.
Tell me that clock is fast.

01:14:43.914 --> 01:14:45.872
Nothing in this country is fast.

01:15:13.596 --> 01:15:15.685
Chief.

01:15:16.642 --> 01:15:19.036
I've got one passenger

01:15:19.036 --> 01:15:21.604
that needs to be dropped off
a little early.

01:15:21.604 --> 01:15:24.389
You think you could
make that happen?

01:15:24.389 --> 01:15:26.783
That would require a permit.

01:15:26.783 --> 01:15:29.263
- Oh.
Wait.

01:15:29.263 --> 01:15:33.006
Or a special...
special police permission.

01:15:37.881 --> 01:15:39.839
I know a place.

01:15:50.241 --> 01:15:52.417
Go for it.
- Huh?

01:15:52.417 --> 01:15:53.940
Go for it.

01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:55.899
You can do it, Diane.

01:15:55.899 --> 01:15:57.901
Careful, Diane!

01:15:57.901 --> 01:15:59.206
Careful!

01:15:59.206 --> 01:16:00.904
I can't open it.

01:16:01.861 --> 01:16:04.081
The top, it's stuck.

01:16:05.038 --> 01:16:07.084
I can't... I... What the...

01:16:07.084 --> 01:16:09.086
- I can't open it.

01:16:09.086 --> 01:16:10.391
Oh, my God!

01:16:10.391 --> 01:16:12.785
- Diane!

01:16:12.785 --> 01:16:14.613
Oh, my... Careful!
Oh, careful!

01:16:14.613 --> 01:16:16.963
Oh, God.

01:16:17.921 --> 01:16:19.749
I did it.

01:16:25.755 --> 01:16:28.105
He really was such a good man.

01:16:28.105 --> 01:16:30.324
- He really was.
- Yeah.

01:16:30.324 --> 01:16:32.326
I really did love him.

01:16:32.326 --> 01:16:34.633
- He loved you, too.

01:16:34.633 --> 01:16:36.287
- He would've liked this, right?
- Yeah.

01:16:36.287 --> 01:16:38.942
I mean, well,
minus the skydiving part.

01:16:41.901 --> 01:16:43.555
- Thank you.
- Oh.

01:17:13.759 --> 01:17:16.893
I knew I liked you
the moment I met you.

01:17:16.893 --> 01:17:19.678
For me,
it took a little longer.

01:17:20.897 --> 01:17:22.812
How can I repay you?

01:17:23.943 --> 01:17:26.990
Save me a dance,
and we call it even.

01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:29.862
Bring the handcuffs,
and you've got a deal.

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:37.783
<i>Buongiorno!</i>

01:17:38.741 --> 01:17:40.220
The bride is here.

01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:41.874
<i>Grazie al Signore.</i>

01:17:41.874 --> 01:17:45.704
My name is Pasquale,
and I'm ready to marry you.

01:17:45.704 --> 01:17:47.750
Get in line, Pasquale.

01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:48.968
She's taken.

01:17:50.535 --> 01:17:53.059
I sleep, breathe...
I dream your wedding.

01:17:53.059 --> 01:17:55.496
I live to make
this wedding happen.

01:17:55.496 --> 01:17:58.282
It is my oxygen.

01:17:58.282 --> 01:17:59.979
That's so nice. Thank you.

01:17:59.979 --> 01:18:02.808
Yes, but do you think that
maybe we should get going?

01:18:02.808 --> 01:18:04.288
<i>Siì, si, siì, si. Andiamo.</i>

01:18:04.288 --> 01:18:06.464
Music to my ears.

01:18:06.464 --> 01:18:08.335
Oh, my God.

01:18:08.335 --> 01:18:11.295
Only a little behind schedule.

01:18:11.295 --> 01:18:12.862
No worries.

01:18:12.862 --> 01:18:15.212
I will check on the groom
and be back to you

01:18:15.212 --> 01:18:16.909
<i>- molto, molto presto.</i>
- Oh, thank you.

01:18:18.563 --> 01:18:19.782
Yeah.

01:18:19.782 --> 01:18:20.870
Oh. I-I'm gonna go call Bruce.

01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:22.045
- Oh.
- I'll catch up.

01:18:22.045 --> 01:18:23.220
- Okay. Okay.
- O-Okay, great.

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:24.787
Let-let's meet in Viv's room.

01:18:24.787 --> 01:18:27.703
- We made it.
- Yes.

01:18:40.628 --> 01:18:42.021
Few moment more.

01:18:42.021 --> 01:18:43.675
<i>- Per favore. Per favore.</i>

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:47.940
Ciao, Pasquale.

01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:49.681
Signor Arthur!

01:18:52.815 --> 01:18:54.381
Signor Arthur.

01:18:54.381 --> 01:18:56.601
What's the good word, Pasquale?

01:18:56.601 --> 01:19:00.213
I am very happy to say your
bride-to-be is officially here.

01:19:00.213 --> 01:19:01.954
Shall I take you to her?

01:19:01.954 --> 01:19:04.217
Oh, I believe that
it's bad luck for the groom

01:19:04.217 --> 01:19:06.350
to see the bride
before the ceremony, isn't it?

01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:07.786
I don't believe in luck.

01:19:07.786 --> 01:19:09.222
I believe in love.

01:19:10.571 --> 01:19:12.269
Well, that's why we're all here.

01:19:12.269 --> 01:19:15.272
But when you've waited
as long as I have,

01:19:15.272 --> 01:19:16.839
what's a few more minutes?

01:19:16.839 --> 01:19:18.884
It's true.

01:19:28.024 --> 01:19:31.114
Oh, my God.

01:19:31.114 --> 01:19:34.378
This is the best sight
I've seen in all of Italy.

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.033
Oh.

01:19:37.033 --> 01:19:38.469
I missed you so much.

01:19:38.469 --> 01:19:40.340
Mmm.

01:19:42.473 --> 01:19:44.301
You think this is really
gonna happen?

01:19:44.301 --> 01:19:46.085
Mm-hmm.

01:19:46.085 --> 01:19:47.826
- I do. I think so.
- Mm. Good.

01:19:47.826 --> 01:19:49.654
- Yeah.
- I love a wedding.

01:19:49.654 --> 01:19:52.048
Such a romantic.

01:19:52.048 --> 01:19:53.876
- I better change, though.
- Better not.

01:19:53.876 --> 01:19:55.703
Oh. -I love you
just the way you are.

01:19:55.703 --> 01:19:58.576
Oh, come on. Don't burn up
all your romanticism.

01:19:58.576 --> 01:20:00.317
I mean, we still got
a long day ahead of us.

01:20:00.317 --> 01:20:02.885
You know I don't...

01:20:02.885 --> 01:20:04.103
Oh, my God.

01:20:04.103 --> 01:20:06.062
Oh, Mitchell.

01:20:06.062 --> 01:20:08.499
- What did you do?
- I had no choice.

01:20:08.499 --> 01:20:11.502
When I saw that picture, I...
I had to make a call.

01:20:11.502 --> 01:20:13.504
I can't wear this, can I?

01:20:13.504 --> 01:20:17.421
Donato assured me that this
dress was <i>perfetto</i> for today.

01:20:17.421 --> 01:20:19.292
So, who am I to argue?

01:20:20.293 --> 01:20:21.599
You're real trouble,
you know that?

01:20:21.599 --> 01:20:23.035
That's why I'm here.

01:20:25.777 --> 01:20:27.692
Yeah. Trouble.

01:20:34.046 --> 01:20:35.831
Oh, Viv.

01:20:36.788 --> 01:20:38.790
Look at you.

01:20:39.791 --> 01:20:42.489
You look truly beautiful.

01:20:42.489 --> 01:20:44.056
You think? Yeah?

01:20:44.056 --> 01:20:46.363
- Thank you.
- Stunning.

01:20:46.363 --> 01:20:48.713
Thank you. So do you.

01:20:48.713 --> 01:20:51.368
Are we ready for this?

01:20:51.368 --> 01:20:53.109
Oh, my goodness.

01:20:53.109 --> 01:20:54.414
Oh, hi.

01:20:54.414 --> 01:20:56.068
That's the dress.

01:20:56.068 --> 01:20:57.983
- Uh-huh.
- How did you get it?

01:20:57.983 --> 01:21:00.029
- Oh, Mitchell.
- Oh, my God.

01:21:00.029 --> 01:21:02.466
This guy pulls things
out of his sleeve.

01:21:02.466 --> 01:21:03.815
I know.

01:21:03.815 --> 01:21:05.556
Bruce still isn't
answering his phone.

01:21:05.556 --> 01:21:06.949
- Oh.
- Sorry.

01:21:06.949 --> 01:21:08.298
Oh.

01:21:08.298 --> 01:21:10.082
- Oh, my God.
Oh!

01:21:10.082 --> 01:21:12.345
You all look so beautiful.

01:21:12.345 --> 01:21:13.912
Oh, God.

01:21:13.912 --> 01:21:17.220
Oh, God.
Why do I feel so nervous?

01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:19.657
No, it's-it's just
wedding day jitters.

01:21:19.657 --> 01:21:21.877
It's just totally normal.

01:21:27.926 --> 01:21:29.145
This is it.

01:21:29.145 --> 01:21:30.755
- Yeah.
- This is it.

01:21:30.755 --> 01:21:32.670
It's gonna be great.

01:21:34.411 --> 01:21:36.848
Can I just say
how much I love you all?

01:21:36.848 --> 01:21:39.024
And this was
the best bachelorette trip

01:21:39.024 --> 01:21:40.504
I could imagine.

01:21:40.504 --> 01:21:42.071
- That is so good,

01:21:42.071 --> 01:21:44.029
because it's the best one
we could've thrown.

01:21:44.029 --> 01:21:45.639
- Yeah. Big-time.

01:21:45.639 --> 01:21:47.728
We way over-delivered.

01:21:47.728 --> 01:21:50.035
- Yeah, what else is new?
- Yeah.

01:21:50.035 --> 01:21:51.341
- Okay, I need a hug.
- Ooh!

01:21:51.341 --> 01:21:52.777
All right.

01:21:52.777 --> 01:21:54.735
Aw.

01:21:56.215 --> 01:21:57.695
You're the loves of my life.

01:21:57.695 --> 01:21:58.957
- You know that.
- No.

01:21:58.957 --> 01:22:00.916
Oh, we love you, too.

01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:03.701
And I love you all,
but it's time.

01:22:03.701 --> 01:22:05.790
Let's get you in that dress.

01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:07.618
- Okay.

01:22:07.618 --> 01:22:10.055
Oh, here.

01:22:10.055 --> 01:22:11.535
- Mmm.
- Oh.

01:22:11.535 --> 01:22:14.930
- Um, yeah.

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:16.975
- I hope that was mine.

01:22:16.975 --> 01:22:19.151
- Whoa.
- Oh. -Oh.

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:22.981
Hmm.
- Okay.

01:22:22.981 --> 01:22:25.636
Well, one of these
was definitely not mine.

01:22:26.724 --> 01:22:28.987
Showtime, people.

01:22:32.556 --> 01:22:34.993
For real this time.

01:22:40.477 --> 01:22:42.740
Well, here we go.

01:22:44.394 --> 01:22:46.613
Oh, God.

01:22:46.613 --> 01:22:48.267
- What?
- What?

01:22:48.267 --> 01:22:49.616
What?

01:22:49.616 --> 01:22:51.662
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
- Oh, no.

01:22:51.662 --> 01:22:53.403
Well, you know
what that means, don't you?

01:22:53.403 --> 01:22:54.795
No. What?

01:22:54.795 --> 01:22:56.493
You're pregnant.

01:22:56.493 --> 01:22:58.843
I mean, at least that's
what it meant at my wedding.

01:23:00.062 --> 01:23:01.498
- Seriously, I...
- Huh? Huh?

01:23:01.498 --> 01:23:03.543
This is crazy.

01:23:03.543 --> 01:23:05.763
I don't know why
I agreed to do this.

01:23:05.763 --> 01:23:07.504
I mean, it makes no sense.

01:23:07.504 --> 01:23:09.636
Of course not.
But don't you understand?

01:23:09.636 --> 01:23:12.074
That's what makes it so amazing.

01:23:12.074 --> 01:23:14.902
Loving someone
and having them love you

01:23:14.902 --> 01:23:16.730
is reason enough.

01:23:16.730 --> 01:23:19.342
Look at you. Look where we are.

01:23:19.342 --> 01:23:21.083
Look at what we've been through.

01:23:21.083 --> 01:23:22.867
We made it. And you, Viv.

01:23:22.867 --> 01:23:24.869
You have never been one
to follow the flock,

01:23:24.869 --> 01:23:27.480
because you are
your own drummer boy, okay?

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:29.047
So just trust your heart, Viv.

01:23:29.047 --> 01:23:31.006
Trust it. Trust it.

01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:32.833
'Cause it always
guides you right.

01:23:32.833 --> 01:23:34.357
Always.

01:23:35.358 --> 01:23:37.055
She's right, Slim.

01:23:37.055 --> 01:23:39.405
You deserve
your fairy-tale ending.

01:23:39.405 --> 01:23:40.754
Let's go get it.

01:23:40.754 --> 01:23:42.191
Yeah, you've earned it.

01:23:42.191 --> 01:23:44.062
Think of all we've overcome
to get here.

01:23:44.062 --> 01:23:47.326
That's true, and now
all the problems are behind us.

01:23:49.894 --> 01:23:51.722
We have a problem.

01:23:51.722 --> 01:23:53.898
I knew as soon as I said it.

01:23:53.898 --> 01:23:57.380
It's fine. We are going
to make a little pause.

01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:58.424
A pause?

01:23:58.424 --> 01:24:00.078
Wha... Wh-Why?

01:24:00.078 --> 01:24:01.819
The priest is missing.

01:24:03.473 --> 01:24:05.170
The priest is missing?

01:24:08.434 --> 01:24:10.088
This feels like a bad omen.

01:24:10.088 --> 01:24:11.437
Mm-mm-mm.

01:24:12.438 --> 01:24:14.266
Oh, fine.

01:24:14.266 --> 01:24:16.138
I'll do it.

01:24:16.138 --> 01:24:17.661
What?

01:24:17.661 --> 01:24:19.619
I'll perform the ceremony.

01:24:20.881 --> 01:24:22.579
- Really?
- Yeah. I'll marry you.

01:24:22.579 --> 01:24:24.798
What?
- Yes!

01:24:24.798 --> 01:24:26.974
What good is a judicial title

01:24:26.974 --> 01:24:30.065
if you can't degrade yourself
in front of your friends?

01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:31.544
- Come on. Let's do it.

01:24:31.544 --> 01:24:33.807
Yeah. Yes.

01:24:37.115 --> 01:24:39.509
- The wedding is back on.

01:24:39.509 --> 01:24:41.076
- From the top.

01:24:42.729 --> 01:24:44.688
Hey.

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:55.438
Nice save, Your Honor.

01:24:55.438 --> 01:24:57.788
You have no idea.

01:24:59.790 --> 01:25:03.141
Okay, and now it's time.

01:25:03.141 --> 01:25:05.012
Ah. It's time.

01:25:05.012 --> 01:25:06.710
Mm.

01:25:06.710 --> 01:25:08.538
- Okay.
- It's time.

01:25:08.538 --> 01:25:10.583
- Ooh.

01:25:10.583 --> 01:25:13.456
- Oh, oh, that's-that's me.
- What? Oh.

01:25:13.456 --> 01:25:15.545
Sorry. Oh, it's Bruce.

01:25:15.545 --> 01:25:17.329
- Go. Take it.
- Uh, no.

01:25:17.329 --> 01:25:19.070
- I can call him back.
- Take it!

01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:20.550
Okay.

01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:23.118
- Bruce? Hi.
<i>Un min... momento.</i>

01:25:29.254 --> 01:25:30.908
- Continue, please.

01:25:30.908 --> 01:25:32.779
Continue.
Just one more tiny moment.

01:25:32.779 --> 01:25:35.521
<i>- Grazie. Grazie, grazie.</i>

01:25:38.524 --> 01:25:41.005
I got your message, Carol.

01:25:41.005 --> 01:25:43.442
I also got your pictures.

01:25:43.442 --> 01:25:45.488
The ones with you and Dough Boy.

01:25:45.488 --> 01:25:47.229
It isn't what you think.

01:25:47.229 --> 01:25:49.274
What are you trying to do,
give me another heart attack?

01:25:49.274 --> 01:25:51.929
- Is that your plan?
- No. No, Bruce.

01:25:51.929 --> 01:25:53.931
Don't even joke about that.

01:25:53.931 --> 01:25:55.759
Believe me, when I get home,

01:25:55.759 --> 01:25:58.327
things are gonna be
so different.

01:25:58.327 --> 01:26:01.460
Our adventure isn't over yet.

01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:04.071
I never should've told you
not to come. It...

01:26:04.071 --> 01:26:05.856
Are you sure?

01:26:05.856 --> 01:26:09.425
If I could snap my fingers
and fix it all, I would. I...

01:26:09.425 --> 01:26:12.558
Y-You should be here.
It's so beautiful.

01:26:13.733 --> 01:26:16.606
You don't think the flowers
are a little bit overdone?

01:26:16.606 --> 01:26:18.129
What?

01:26:18.129 --> 01:26:20.218
The flowers.

01:26:20.218 --> 01:26:22.481
I think there's one too many.

01:26:27.182 --> 01:26:29.532
Well, that's better.

01:26:29.532 --> 01:26:31.490
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:34.189
- Bruce, you're here.
- Hey.

01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:36.539
Oh, God. I can't believe it.

01:26:36.539 --> 01:26:38.671
Well, I wasn't gonna miss
the chance to walk

01:26:38.671 --> 01:26:40.891
my favorite girl down the aisle.
Come on.

01:26:40.891 --> 01:26:43.372
Unless, of course,
you prefer Dough Boy.

01:26:43.372 --> 01:26:45.635
I've got his number.
Do you want me to call him?

01:26:45.635 --> 01:26:47.071
Shut up and kiss me.

01:26:48.768 --> 01:26:50.509
Mmm.

01:26:52.076 --> 01:26:54.600
Mmm.

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:58.125
Oh, this is Bruce. Sorry.

01:26:58.125 --> 01:27:00.867
Oh, thank goodness.
Bruce is here.

01:27:04.044 --> 01:27:05.916
To make it official.

01:27:11.574 --> 01:27:12.792
Nice dress.

01:27:12.792 --> 01:27:14.272
- You like it?
- Mm-hmm.

01:27:14.272 --> 01:27:16.056
- I just found it in the closet.
- Mm.

01:27:16.056 --> 01:27:17.275
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

01:27:17.275 --> 01:27:18.711
Mm-hmm.

01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:48.828
Wow.

01:28:18.902 --> 01:28:20.599
- Well...

01:28:20.599 --> 01:28:24.516
...here we all are,
which is shocking.

01:28:24.516 --> 01:28:27.998
And not just because we spent
last night in a jail cell.

01:28:27.998 --> 01:28:31.741
It's shocking because
I've known this woman

01:28:31.741 --> 01:28:34.178
since we were 19 years old

01:28:34.178 --> 01:28:37.007
and I never thought
there would be a man

01:28:37.007 --> 01:28:40.967
she was willing
to walk down the aisle for.

01:28:40.967 --> 01:28:42.882
But there is such a man,

01:28:42.882 --> 01:28:46.233
and he's well deserved
of that unique achievement.

01:28:47.757 --> 01:28:51.064
And of my dear friend's hand
in marriage.

01:28:52.022 --> 01:28:54.459
- To begin...
- Um, uh, h-hold...

01:28:54.459 --> 01:28:57.288
Can I... Can I just say
something quickly?

01:28:57.288 --> 01:28:59.986
O-Of course.
This is your big day.

01:29:02.554 --> 01:29:05.209
Arthur, is it okay if I talk
to you for just a second

01:29:05.209 --> 01:29:07.516
as though I didn't have
this dress on and...

01:29:07.516 --> 01:29:09.996
and you didn't have
two rings in your pocket?

01:29:11.215 --> 01:29:13.217
Sure.

01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:18.353
The truth is
I never wanted to be a wife.

01:29:19.615 --> 01:29:22.444
You know, I always saw
a wedding ring as a chain.

01:29:22.444 --> 01:29:25.490
You know, a...
a one-link chain of...

01:29:25.490 --> 01:29:27.623
of limitation.

01:29:29.929 --> 01:29:34.847
But there is no limit to
the love that I have for you.

01:29:34.847 --> 01:29:37.633
You know,
that's what I've realized.

01:29:37.633 --> 01:29:41.419
That's why I'm here today.

01:29:41.419 --> 01:29:43.421
I love you, Arthur.

01:29:43.421 --> 01:29:45.945
I love you. I want to move
to New York with you.

01:29:45.945 --> 01:29:47.730
I want to walk
in the streets with you.

01:29:47.730 --> 01:29:50.123
I want to make love
in the park with you.

01:29:50.123 --> 01:29:52.125
Well, not the dirty part
of the park.

01:29:53.431 --> 01:29:55.259
You know, the-the clean part,

01:29:55.259 --> 01:29:58.088
with the trees and the grass
and no syringes.

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:04.573
We've spent a lifetime apart.

01:30:04.573 --> 01:30:07.445
Now we have to figure out a way
how to squeeze a lifetime

01:30:07.445 --> 01:30:09.099
into the time we have left.

01:30:09.099 --> 01:30:11.188
And we can do it.

01:30:11.188 --> 01:30:13.103
We can.

01:30:14.539 --> 01:30:17.716
I choose you, Arthur Riley.

01:30:17.716 --> 01:30:21.764
I choose you today
and every day.

01:30:23.505 --> 01:30:25.507
- You may kiss the bride.

01:30:25.507 --> 01:30:26.986
Wait.

01:30:26.986 --> 01:30:28.510
Aren't I supposed
to say something?

01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:30.947
Oh. Oh, right, sorry.
I-I got swept away.

01:30:30.947 --> 01:30:34.559
And-and now,
Arthur with his closing remarks.

01:30:34.559 --> 01:30:36.648
Vows, whatever. Go.

01:30:43.612 --> 01:30:45.962
You don't want to be
a wife, do you?

01:30:48.399 --> 01:30:50.401
You don't want to be married.

01:30:50.401 --> 01:30:52.708
That's what you just said,
isn't it?

01:30:52.708 --> 01:30:55.319
Yes, I-I guess I did, yeah.

01:30:56.842 --> 01:30:58.583
There was a part of me
that believed

01:30:58.583 --> 01:31:01.412
that you really wanted
to be married, but...

01:31:03.066 --> 01:31:05.155
...who was I kidding?

01:31:06.722 --> 01:31:08.288
I knew you'd do this.

01:31:08.288 --> 01:31:10.465
I knew it.

01:31:15.513 --> 01:31:17.428
Vivian...

01:31:18.603 --> 01:31:20.649
I don't need
the title of husband,

01:31:20.649 --> 01:31:23.652
and I don't need
the institution of marriage

01:31:23.652 --> 01:31:26.568
to know that I'm gonna
choose you every day.

01:31:28.004 --> 01:31:31.921
I proposed to you
when we were in our 20s

01:31:31.921 --> 01:31:35.402
'cause I was so damn in love
with you that I-I knew then

01:31:35.402 --> 01:31:37.883
that I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with you.

01:31:39.058 --> 01:31:43.410
And as luck would have it,
or some divine masterstroke,

01:31:43.410 --> 01:31:45.717
we reconnected.

01:31:45.717 --> 01:31:48.459
And I'll be damned
if I don't still feel the same.

01:31:50.243 --> 01:31:52.507
But a little differently.

01:31:53.508 --> 01:31:56.641
Oh, I don't love you any less.

01:31:56.641 --> 01:31:59.601
And I think I may
understand you a little better.

01:32:00.732 --> 01:32:03.387
You're...

01:32:03.387 --> 01:32:07.478
like this ring that I'm holding.

01:32:07.478 --> 01:32:11.482
A complete and perfect circle
unto your own.

01:32:11.482 --> 01:32:13.876
And if you're not always free

01:32:13.876 --> 01:32:16.966
to roll on your own
the way you want,

01:32:16.966 --> 01:32:19.098
then you're not you.

01:32:20.099 --> 01:32:23.494
And it's you that I love.

01:32:25.931 --> 01:32:27.977
You're my perfect circle.

01:32:30.066 --> 01:32:33.199
So, if you'll allow me
a do-over,

01:32:33.199 --> 01:32:36.333
I'd like to ask
my question again.

01:32:37.682 --> 01:32:40.163
Aw.

01:32:40.163 --> 01:32:43.601
Vivian, I love you
with all my heart.

01:32:43.601 --> 01:32:47.605
That has never changed,
and it never will.

01:32:48.650 --> 01:32:51.740
But I just got to know...

01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:53.916
will you not marry me?

01:32:56.048 --> 01:32:59.008
There's nothing I'd love more.

01:33:00.618 --> 01:33:03.926
You're supposed to wait
for my cue.

01:33:03.926 --> 01:33:05.754
Nobody ever waits for my cue.

01:33:05.754 --> 01:33:09.453
May you always love each other
as you do today.

01:33:09.453 --> 01:33:13.631
I now pronounce you
not husband and wife.

01:33:13.631 --> 01:33:14.937
- Yes!

01:33:14.937 --> 01:33:16.242
Yay!

01:33:16.242 --> 01:33:17.504
Oh, my God!

01:33:18.810 --> 01:33:20.377
- Thanks, man.
- Oh, my God.

01:33:20.377 --> 01:33:21.247
Congratulations,
you handsome devil.

01:33:21.247 --> 01:33:23.293
He gets it!

01:33:26.426 --> 01:33:28.385
Thank you.

01:33:31.083 --> 01:33:32.737
We did it.

01:33:32.737 --> 01:33:34.739
We made it to the end!

01:33:40.092 --> 01:33:41.833
- Wait a second. Come on.
- What? What do you mean?

01:33:41.833 --> 01:33:43.313
- Get back up here.
- Wait, what?

01:33:43.313 --> 01:33:44.575
- Get back up here.
- Oh.

01:33:44.575 --> 01:33:46.359
Can we wait one second, please?

01:33:46.359 --> 01:33:48.535
Hmm?

01:33:48.535 --> 01:33:50.059
Give me one second.

01:33:51.669 --> 01:33:53.279
You said some things back there
about marriage

01:33:53.279 --> 01:33:54.933
I've never heard you say before.

01:33:54.933 --> 01:33:56.674
Uh-huh.

01:33:56.674 --> 01:33:58.458
Uh, can we pause the music
a second, please?

01:34:03.115 --> 01:34:06.553
Did you mean what you said--
that love was reason enough--

01:34:06.553 --> 01:34:08.555
or were those just words?

01:34:08.555 --> 01:34:10.949
Mitchell, is this really
the best time?

01:34:10.949 --> 01:34:12.951
I think it is.

01:34:12.951 --> 01:34:14.866
Well, fine. Why not?

01:34:14.866 --> 01:34:17.173
I guess
it's as good a time as any.

01:34:17.173 --> 01:34:18.783
It is.

01:34:18.783 --> 01:34:21.830
Maybe a few days ago,
it would've been just words,

01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:23.701
but not today.

01:34:23.701 --> 01:34:26.269
- Mm.
- It's... it's so easy

01:34:26.269 --> 01:34:29.011
to believe in things
when we're young, isn't it?

01:34:29.011 --> 01:34:32.014
And we can do whatever we want,
and everything is possible.

01:34:32.014 --> 01:34:35.539
And then we get older,

01:34:35.539 --> 01:34:39.108
and life starts to silence us.

01:34:39.108 --> 01:34:40.762
- But guess what.
- What?

01:34:40.762 --> 01:34:43.155
- The whisper is still there.
- Mm.

01:34:43.155 --> 01:34:46.332
And if you pay
close enough attention,

01:34:46.332 --> 01:34:48.726
- you're gonna hear it.
- Mm.

01:34:48.726 --> 01:34:51.686
In my case,
it was a trip with my friends.

01:34:51.686 --> 01:34:54.079
And I heard it
in the art we saw.

01:34:54.079 --> 01:34:55.559
Remember the art?

01:34:55.559 --> 01:34:57.866
And the moments
that we shared together.

01:34:57.866 --> 01:35:01.608
And the whisper just got
a little bit louder,

01:35:01.608 --> 01:35:04.655
and everything started to feel
a little more possible.

01:35:04.655 --> 01:35:09.051
And now, here I am standing
in front of the man I love,

01:35:09.051 --> 01:35:11.836
surrounded by my best friends
in the world,

01:35:11.836 --> 01:35:16.101
and all I can see
is what's in front of me.

01:35:16.101 --> 01:35:17.494
- Mm.
- So, you want to know

01:35:17.494 --> 01:35:18.843
- what I think, really?
- Yes.

01:35:18.843 --> 01:35:21.846
I think love is reason enough

01:35:21.846 --> 01:35:24.501
and the rest of our lives
start today,

01:35:24.501 --> 01:35:26.111
so what are we waiting for?

01:35:26.111 --> 01:35:27.678
- I'm not waiting.
- Oh, you're not?

01:35:27.678 --> 01:35:29.158
-  Okay. Okay.
I'm here.

01:35:29.158 --> 01:35:31.290
Oh, boy. I'm not sure
how you follow that.

01:35:31.290 --> 01:35:33.858
You don't follow that.
You just ride alongside of it.

01:35:33.858 --> 01:35:36.469
And you thank your lucky stars
every day that you do.

01:35:37.819 --> 01:35:41.039
Diane, I've never...
I've never been married before

01:35:41.039 --> 01:35:44.434
because I never found someone
that made me see

01:35:44.434 --> 01:35:47.219
the reason why I should.

01:35:49.221 --> 01:35:51.093
Don't you dare move.

01:35:51.093 --> 01:35:53.095
Oh. What?

01:35:53.095 --> 01:35:54.618
Don't...

01:35:54.618 --> 01:35:56.881
Arthur, the ring.
I need the ring.

01:35:56.881 --> 01:35:58.753
I don't...

01:35:59.797 --> 01:36:00.929
Congratulations.

01:36:00.929 --> 01:36:02.452
Uh-huh.
- Thank you.

01:36:06.108 --> 01:36:07.805
Oh, no.

01:36:07.805 --> 01:36:09.807
Oh, no.

01:36:09.807 --> 01:36:11.591
- I can't believe it.
- Diane...

01:36:11.591 --> 01:36:13.637
- Okay, yes. Oh, my God.

01:36:13.637 --> 01:36:15.682
Yes. Yes.

01:36:15.682 --> 01:36:17.423
You're my reason.

01:36:17.423 --> 01:36:18.903
Will you marry me?

01:36:20.252 --> 01:36:22.341
And I promise I'm not asking
because I'm pregnant.

01:36:22.341 --> 01:36:24.039
Yes.

01:36:24.039 --> 01:36:25.823
Hell yes, I'll marry you.

01:36:25.823 --> 01:36:27.259
I'll marry you right now.

01:36:32.308 --> 01:36:34.179
- Oh, my God.
Bruce.

01:36:35.833 --> 01:36:37.748
Congratulations.

01:36:37.748 --> 01:36:40.055
- Di!
- Well, this is fun.

01:36:40.055 --> 01:36:42.753
- Yes.
- Diane, you crazy person.

01:36:42.753 --> 01:36:47.018
Do you take Mitchell to be
your lawfully wedded husband,

01:36:47.018 --> 01:36:50.239
to love and cherish you
from this day forward?

01:36:50.239 --> 01:36:51.849
Yes.

01:36:51.849 --> 01:36:54.678
You're supposed to say, "I do."

01:36:54.678 --> 01:36:56.288
Oh, okay.

01:36:56.288 --> 01:36:58.421
I... I say...

01:36:58.421 --> 01:37:00.292
- yes, I do.

01:37:00.292 --> 01:37:02.033
I'll take it.

01:37:02.033 --> 01:37:03.905
DIANE [laughing]:
I'm sorry.

01:37:03.905 --> 01:37:08.953
And, Mitchell, do you take Diane
and all her delightful insanity

01:37:08.953 --> 01:37:11.260
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

01:37:12.522 --> 01:37:15.655
- I do, and I can't wait.

01:37:15.655 --> 01:37:18.006
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:37:18.006 --> 01:37:19.485
You may kiss the bride.

01:37:19.485 --> 01:37:20.878
- Nobody waits for my cue.

01:37:29.321 --> 01:37:31.062
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:37:36.763 --> 01:37:38.461
Hey, Chief.

01:37:51.387 --> 01:37:53.780
<i>How does a woman in her 70s</i>

01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:56.000
<i>- end up getting married?</i>

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.047
<i>In Italy, no less.</i>

01:37:59.047 --> 01:38:02.267
<i>She takes control
of her own destiny.</i>

01:38:04.617 --> 01:38:06.489
- Gosh.

01:38:06.489 --> 01:38:08.621
I love you. Love you.

01:38:10.275 --> 01:38:12.277
What's she doing?

01:38:15.411 --> 01:38:17.413
- Okay, run.

01:38:17.413 --> 01:38:19.632
No, actually, let's walk fast.

01:38:22.722 --> 01:38:24.855
- What-what are you...

01:38:24.855 --> 01:38:27.249
What are you doing?

01:38:27.249 --> 01:38:30.817
So... So, I'm gonna do
this honeymoon thing,

01:38:30.817 --> 01:38:33.081
but I just wanted to ask,

01:38:33.081 --> 01:38:35.126
well, what are we doing next?

01:38:36.606 --> 01:38:39.565
I don't know, but I know
one thing for sure--

01:38:39.565 --> 01:38:41.959
we're not gonna
leave it up to fate.

01:38:41.959 --> 01:38:44.048
- Right!
- Aw.
