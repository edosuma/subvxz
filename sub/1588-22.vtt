00:01.301 --> 00:04.451
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:21.422 --> 00:25.559
(LAUGHING)
Those McCracken sisters
aren't going to be riding off

00:25.626 --> 00:27.562
with the blue ribbon
this year.

00:27.629 --> 00:32.132
Our lousy luck potion
is going to win that witches'
showcase tonight.

00:32.199 --> 00:34.601
Oh, I can feel it.

00:34.668 --> 00:39.073
Thomas!

00:39.140 --> 00:43.744
The rest of the ingredients,
boy. Chop, chop.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.546
(SCREECHING)

00:45.612 --> 00:47.681
(GAGGING)

00:47.748 --> 00:49.848
Focus, Thomas.

01:01.896 --> 01:03.530
No time to rest, Jerry.

01:03.597 --> 01:08.503
Help the poor cat.

01:08.570 --> 01:12.573
I cannot wait
to see that elfkin
Belinda McCracken's face

01:12.639 --> 01:16.744
when the Witch Master
calls our names.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.178
Careful now.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.045
(SHATTERING)

01:24.451 --> 01:25.586
Phew.

01:25.652 --> 01:27.320
The potion's ready.

01:27.387 --> 01:30.223
Now, for the poof of proof.

01:30.290 --> 01:32.325
(RUMBLING)

01:32.392 --> 01:34.795
(RUMBLING STOPS)

01:34.862 --> 01:37.431
(SHUDDERING)

01:37.497 --> 01:39.733
Did we miss the poof of proof?

01:39.800 --> 01:43.037
We must have
forgotten something.

01:43.104 --> 01:45.906
(GASPS) The most important
ingredient.

01:45.973 --> 01:49.643
One hair plucked
from the head of a black cat.

01:49.710 --> 01:52.246
Thomas, Jerry,
we need one hair

01:52.313 --> 01:54.848
freshly plucked from the head
of a black cat.

01:54.915 --> 01:57.318
The hair must be dropped
in this potion right away.

01:57.385 --> 02:01.221
Within seconds of plucking it,
or it won't work. Got it?

02:01.288 --> 02:03.757
And no frolicking about.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.393
You must be back
before sundown,

02:05.460 --> 02:09.863
or you'll be calling
a lily-pad your new home.

02:09.930 --> 02:13.680
Have I made myself clear?

02:15.769 --> 02:18.769
Good. Now hop to it.

02:25.513 --> 02:30.513
It might be time
to get a smarter cat.

02:34.589 --> 02:39.589
BUTCH: Fair Toodles,
may I have your hand
in marriage?

02:42.597 --> 02:46.834
Fair Toodles,
may I have your hand
in marriage?

02:46.900 --> 02:49.670
Too unoriginal.

02:49.736 --> 02:52.539
Marry me, fair maiden!

02:52.606 --> 02:54.843
Too predictable.

02:54.909 --> 02:59.909
WITCH: <i>One hair
</i> <i>freshly plucked from
</i> <i>the head of a black cat.</i>

03:01.882 --> 03:04.352
Listen, toad,
it's not about love.

03:04.418 --> 03:07.788
Get that through
your warty little head.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.957
It's about getting in good
with the King

03:10.024 --> 03:15.024
and living in the castle
and wearing fancy clothes.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.534
Ow!

03:20.601 --> 03:23.837
Whatcha do that for?

03:23.904 --> 03:25.404
Too weird.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.836
BUTCH: Beat it, pals.

03:55.903 --> 03:59.953
I got some proposing to do.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.448
Marry you?

04:14.387 --> 04:16.423
(GASPS)

04:16.490 --> 04:17.658
Back off, bub.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.660
The lady's mine.

04:19.726 --> 04:21.226
I'm yours?

04:31.071 --> 04:33.373
Fair Toodles...

04:33.440 --> 04:35.208
Mine!

04:35.275 --> 04:36.277
Mine!

04:36.344 --> 04:39.781
Hey, busters,
I'm nobody's rag doll.

04:39.848 --> 04:44.848
Then we'll compete
to see who's most worthy
of the Princess' love.

04:45.452 --> 04:48.690
How's that?

04:48.756 --> 04:53.194
Don't worry, Toods,
this interloper don't
stand a chance.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.829
A competition for your love!

04:55.896 --> 04:57.431
How romantic.

04:57.498 --> 05:00.834
And the runner-up shall win
a date with my chamber maid.

05:00.901 --> 05:05.639
Meathelda.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.574
It's all or nothing, boys.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.544
Fine! Sure, whatever.

05:09.610 --> 05:14.610
I know, let's start
this competion
with a little archery.

05:18.886 --> 05:23.886
May I have your hand
in marriage...

05:31.665 --> 05:34.969
Where's that blasted cat?

05:35.036 --> 05:40.036
Hear ye, hear ye,
the Tournament of Worthiness
will now commence.

05:40.508 --> 05:45.508
Whoever wins
will be names most worthy
of Toodles' love.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.987
The first event is...

05:54.054 --> 05:56.857
Who can sing the longest note.

05:56.924 --> 05:59.324
I love this one.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.766
MEATHELDA: The next event...

06:38.833 --> 06:43.833
Pin the tail
on the fire-breathing dragon.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.611
(GASPS)

07:20.473 --> 07:22.273
(DOOR OPENS)

07:26.480 --> 07:29.683
Where's that blasted cat?

07:29.750 --> 07:33.800
The strongest tail contest.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.867
(SCREAMING)

07:45.934 --> 07:49.903
MEATHELDA: The best cheese

the competition is tied.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.726
The winner of the final event

08:11.793 --> 08:16.793
will be deemed most worthy
of the Princess' love.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.667

Ready!

08:52.966 --> 08:55.936

08:56.003 --> 08:57.037
Joust!

(CROAKING)

10:03.837 --> 10:05.407
Thomas, Jerry...

10:05.474 --> 10:09.977
Guess whose
lousy luck potion didn't
win the showcase tonight.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.412
You're right, ours.

10:11.479 --> 10:16.479
Because you didn't
get it back here in time.

10:30.864 --> 10:32.332
