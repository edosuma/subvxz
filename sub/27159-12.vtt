WEBVTT

00:05.233 --> 00:06.600
I have an English bulldog

00:06.633 --> 00:08.567
and I went down
to kiss him one day

00:08.600 --> 00:10.533
and he came up
at the same time

00:10.567 --> 00:12.567
so I got his tooth
through my nose.

00:12.600 --> 00:14.567
I was devastated.

00:16.066 --> 00:17.367
[sniffing]

00:17.400 --> 00:19.166
Seeing Dr. Nassif
even get emotional

00:19.200 --> 00:22.500
makes me feel like
I'm in the right hands.

00:22.533 --> 00:26.367
When I came out of surgery,
and I looked in the mirror,
I said, "What the [bleep]!"

00:26.400 --> 00:30.300
My chin looked square.
I knew it needed to
be fixed ASAP.

00:30.333 --> 00:33.233
[Nassif] Who is that?
[Dubrow]
It looks like Kim Kardashian.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.400
No way!

00:36.500 --> 00:38.600
When I push
on this one direction,

00:38.633 --> 00:40.233
it will discharge
from my nipple.

00:40.266 --> 00:42.433
Every day?
Every day.

00:42.467 --> 00:45.467
I need help
with these lopsided,
leaking ladies.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.467
What the [bleep]
is this?

01:03.433 --> 01:05.233
I'm getting
so hungry.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.367
My name is Laura, and I can tell
from experience

01:07.400 --> 01:09.200
two nostrils
are better than one.

01:09.233 --> 01:11.033
There is a hole in
my nose now

01:11.066 --> 01:12.467
that leads directly
down to my throat.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.133
Everything's gone.

01:14.166 --> 01:15.266
When I go to public places,

01:15.300 --> 01:17.166
I'm always strategically

01:17.200 --> 01:18.433
standing in a certain way.

01:18.467 --> 01:19.600
Because anywhere I go,

01:19.633 --> 01:21.433
people stare at me.

01:21.467 --> 01:23.533
I always have my hands
around my face.

01:23.567 --> 01:25.567
Or I just put my hand
under my nose.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.600
Before I got hurt,
I liked my face,

01:27.633 --> 01:29.500
I mean, I had a nice nose,
and...

01:29.533 --> 01:31.433
I didn't want to
change anything about me.

01:31.467 --> 01:34.033
What happened to me
was a complete accident.

01:34.066 --> 01:36.533
About 11 years ago,
my dog, Brutus, and I...

01:36.567 --> 01:38.266
I went to kiss
the top of his head

01:38.300 --> 01:39.633
and he came up
at the same time

01:39.667 --> 01:41.467
and broke my nose,

01:41.500 --> 01:43.500
and his tooth went through
the middle of my nose.

01:43.533 --> 01:46.533
So this part and this part,
it was not attached.

01:46.567 --> 01:49.033
I went to the hospital,
only to be told

01:49.066 --> 01:52.100
there was really nothing
that they could do for me
until it healed.

01:52.133 --> 01:53.600
Then I went to
a plastic surgeon.

01:53.633 --> 01:56.100
I have the surgery,
I wake up, and...

01:56.133 --> 01:59.533
could not believe
what I had saw.

01:59.567 --> 02:04.266
I was solid stitches
from here all the way down
right through my lip,

02:04.300 --> 02:08.300
and in the middle,
I had, apparently,
a piece of rib bone,

02:08.333 --> 02:11.467
but it was just solid,
like, crusted blood.

02:11.500 --> 02:15.233
A week after that,
my mum said to me,
"Something doesn't look right."

02:15.266 --> 02:17.500
It was just getting worse.
It was changing color.

02:17.533 --> 02:19.367
Almost looked black.

02:19.400 --> 02:22.066
I went and saw him.
I said, "You need to see me."

02:22.100 --> 02:24.600
And he said, you know,
"It's infected."

02:24.633 --> 02:27.266
You know, "This is probably
going to fall apart."

02:27.300 --> 02:30.100
Two, three days later
after that,

02:30.133 --> 02:32.266
my rib bone just came out
the middle of my nose

02:32.300 --> 02:34.567
and I was left with nothing.

02:34.600 --> 02:38.600
No middle, no bottom, nothing.
I was devastated.

02:38.633 --> 02:42.266
I couldn't even look in
the mirror 'cause it didn't
look like me anymore.

02:42.300 --> 02:45.133
And still to this day,
it's what, 10, 12 years later?

02:45.166 --> 02:47.300
I still don't like
looking in the mirror,

02:47.333 --> 02:49.433
I don't like
having my picture taken.

02:49.467 --> 02:52.367
I mean, it's, it's terrible.

02:52.400 --> 02:55.233
I am just sick of
being stared at.
Like, look at us.

02:55.266 --> 02:57.367
I mean, it's 8:30, 9:00
in the morning,

02:57.400 --> 02:59.600
we're food shopping
so I don't have
crowds around me.

02:59.633 --> 03:01.600
Yeah, I wish
it wasn't like that.

03:01.633 --> 03:04.233
The reason I'm pursuing
this surgery now is

03:04.266 --> 03:08.400
I have a son
who is coming into
his teenage years,

03:08.433 --> 03:10.500
and teenage years
are hard enough.

03:10.533 --> 03:12.734
I don't want him
to be embarrassed
for any reason.

03:12.767 --> 03:15.133
I hate my face.

03:16.400 --> 03:19.700
I go into surgery
in the morning at 7 AM,

03:19.734 --> 03:22.600
really excited and nervous,
everything at the same time.

03:22.633 --> 03:27.367
My name is La Demi,
but I was born
Charles Demetri.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.200
Who is that?
[laughs]

03:29.233 --> 03:31.333
I documented
my entire transition

03:31.367 --> 03:34.133
from male to female online
on my YouTube channel.

03:34.166 --> 03:36.200
But my doctor totally
messed up my chin.

03:36.233 --> 03:38.166
Right now,
my chin is very square,

03:38.200 --> 03:40.233
and the right side
sticks out more than the left.

03:40.266 --> 03:42.767
Growing up, I knew I wanted
to be a woman so bad,

03:43.000 --> 03:44.667
but the thought and looking
at the mirror was like,

03:44.700 --> 03:46.400
"There's no way
you could ever."

03:46.433 --> 03:48.166
I was about six
when I would watch

03:48.200 --> 03:49.600
my mum get ready
in the morning,

03:49.633 --> 03:52.166
and I would look at her
looking so gorgeous

03:52.200 --> 03:54.266
and then I'd be like,
"No, don't put the pink lip,
do the red lip,"

03:54.300 --> 03:55.633
you know, like, in my head.

03:55.667 --> 03:57.400
So as soon as she left
for work,

03:57.433 --> 03:58.767
I would run back
to her beauty station,

03:59.000 --> 04:00.533
and kind of
dabble in her makeup,

04:00.567 --> 04:02.400
look back in the mirror
and just, like,

04:02.433 --> 04:04.533
take it off and be kind of,
like, bummed about it,

04:04.567 --> 04:06.633
because I knew,
not that it wasn't right,

04:06.667 --> 04:08.533
but that it wasn't accepted.

04:08.567 --> 04:11.433
It took
having to lose my father

04:11.467 --> 04:14.367
to really understand
who I was,

04:14.400 --> 04:18.200
and that's when I was like,
"Life is so damn short,
like, what are you doing?

04:18.233 --> 04:22.300
Get off your ass, go out there
and follow your dreams,
be who you are."

04:22.333 --> 04:24.567
So, I came
and helped my brothers
carry his casket.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.000
I was wearing a dress, heels,

04:27.033 --> 04:29.500
and presented myself
as Demi to my dad.

04:29.533 --> 04:34.266
[voice breaking]
I don't think I cared
about anyone in the room.

04:34.300 --> 04:36.333
I just wanted my father back,

04:36.367 --> 04:38.400
so I could hear
a response from him

04:38.433 --> 04:40.600
and tell him that this is
who I have always been.

04:42.266 --> 04:43.533
[sobs]
I'm sorry.

04:45.367 --> 04:47.400
I was really fortunate
to move to L.A.

04:47.433 --> 04:49.333
and fall into
a circle of friends

04:49.367 --> 04:51.333
that were really
rooting for me

04:51.367 --> 04:53.300
and were advocates
for pushing

04:53.333 --> 04:55.333
to be who I wanted to be.

04:55.367 --> 04:59.600
Becoming La Demi has definitely
been about a good four years.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.333
I say four years
like it's so long.

05:02.367 --> 05:04.266
I started with HRT,

05:04.300 --> 05:06.700
which is
hormones replacement...
transplant?

05:06.734 --> 05:08.467
I don't know,
I'm not a doctor.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.233
But, started with hormones

05:10.266 --> 05:12.200
and I've been
to several doctors.

05:12.233 --> 05:15.033
I got my boobs done,
my trachea shave,

05:15.066 --> 05:17.000
and a little
of my chin chiseled.

05:17.033 --> 05:19.734
Nothing too dramatic,
just expected it
to be rounded out.

05:19.767 --> 05:22.767
When I came out of surgery,
I was just so excited

05:23.000 --> 05:24.467
to look in the mirror,

05:24.500 --> 05:25.567
and when I looked
in the mirror,

05:25.600 --> 05:26.734
I said, "What the [bleep]!"

05:26.767 --> 05:29.200
My chin looked square.

05:29.233 --> 05:31.567
Kind of boxy. I was just
on the verge of tears.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.667
I knew it needed to
be fixed ASAP.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.400
So, I went back to
that doctor,

05:35.433 --> 05:37.633
but he didn't know
how to fix it.

05:37.667 --> 05:39.734
It is so frustrating.
You're a doctor.

05:39.767 --> 05:41.500
Aren't you supposed to
know this stuff?

05:41.533 --> 05:43.367
After documenting
my transition,

05:43.400 --> 05:45.333
I've been privileged enough
to sign contracts

05:45.367 --> 05:47.033
with Beautycon,
NYX Cosmetics,

05:47.066 --> 05:48.400
and L'Oreal Paris.

05:48.433 --> 05:50.467
My face is my moneymaker,

05:50.500 --> 05:52.667
and how am I supposed to
represent beauty brands

05:52.700 --> 05:54.600
if I don't even
feel beautiful myself?

05:54.633 --> 05:56.367
I'm definitely looking
for a doctor

05:56.400 --> 05:58.000
that can just fix my chin.

05:58.033 --> 06:00.033
Right now,
I'm at the peak of my career,

06:00.066 --> 06:03.300
so I'm so excited
and I just wanna
keep moving forward.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.767
[Nassif]
So, we have a lady.
Her name is Laura.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.567
She's coming to us
from Canada.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.633
There is a history
of blunt trauma to the nose,

06:12.667 --> 06:15.700
and then completely
having her surgery fall apart.

06:17.033 --> 06:18.533
There you go.
Oh my gosh!

06:18.567 --> 06:19.767
Completely missing columella.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.333
Probably no septum,
no nothing.

06:21.367 --> 06:22.600
Okay?
Oh...

06:22.633 --> 06:24.400
Tough problem
to fix.

06:24.433 --> 06:25.600
Can you please
send in Laura?

06:27.533 --> 06:30.000
Hi.
Laura?
Hi, Dr. Nassif.

06:30.033 --> 06:33.333
What I'm hoping today
to get out of my consultation
is hopefully some good news.

06:33.367 --> 06:35.066
The last consultation
I had with a plastic surgeon,

06:35.100 --> 06:36.633
I didn't even
bring Clayton with me.

06:36.667 --> 06:38.300
Because he wanted to knock
the doctor out,

06:38.333 --> 06:40.100
so I didn't take him with me.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.400
I want to first say that
I never had a problem
with my nose.

06:42.433 --> 06:45.000
This is all
stemming from an injury.

06:45.033 --> 06:48.266
I have an English bulldog,
and I went down
to kiss him one day

06:48.300 --> 06:49.734
and he came up
at the same time,

06:49.767 --> 06:52.266
so I got his tooth
through my nose.

06:52.300 --> 06:54.400
Why? Cause he had
one of his teeth right there?
[Laura] Yes.

06:54.433 --> 06:56.133
[Clayton]
Oh yeah. Yes.
They had it there.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.633
So, he didn't bite you.
No.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.533
So, this was, like, cut?
It was cut.

06:59.567 --> 07:01.100
And the septum
was right behind it?

07:01.133 --> 07:03.433
Yes, but-- and that
was all broken.

07:03.467 --> 07:04.734
[Clayton] I don't know...
What a strong dog,

07:04.767 --> 07:07.066
to break the nose too.
Oh yeah.

07:07.100 --> 07:10.066
I've seen a handful
of nasal injuries,

07:10.100 --> 07:13.600
especially bites,
caused by a dog.

07:13.633 --> 07:16.500
But a headbutt?
That's one a kind.

07:16.533 --> 07:19.333
And then the surgery,
he was supposed to

07:19.367 --> 07:21.333
cut my cheek, wrap it.

07:21.367 --> 07:22.633
Okay. A flap.
Wait a minute.

07:22.667 --> 07:25.100
Oh, he was going to do
a nasolabial flap.

07:25.133 --> 07:27.700
Yes.
So your tissue was
so bad here...

07:27.734 --> 07:29.734
Mm-hmm.
...he wanted
to lift a piece of tissue

07:29.767 --> 07:31.533
Mm-hmm.
...and put it there.

07:31.567 --> 07:34.033
Yes. But I had all of this.

07:34.066 --> 07:37.066
All of this bottom part,
everything,
it was all there.

07:37.100 --> 07:39.400
He removed all of this.
I don't know why
he removed all this.

07:39.433 --> 07:40.767
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.033
What do you
mean removed all of what?

07:43.066 --> 07:45.066
The bottom, like,
the "W" part of your nose...

07:45.100 --> 07:46.633
[Nassif] Was intact.
...in the middle,
on the end here...

07:46.667 --> 07:48.500
So, it was there before?
[Laura] It was there before.

07:48.533 --> 07:52.600
He had cut down both
sides of my face
through my lip.

07:52.633 --> 07:53.767
What do you mean,
"through your lip"?

07:54.000 --> 07:55.767
Because the incisions
are here.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.734
You can see my scars
right through my lips.

07:57.767 --> 08:01.100
So, I had stitches
all the way running down...

08:01.133 --> 08:03.667
through.
And you didn't know
he was going to do that?

08:03.700 --> 08:04.700
[Laura] No.
Okay.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.100
Laura's nose and face

08:06.133 --> 08:08.100
is basically a road map,

08:08.133 --> 08:11.066
but she has incisions
everywhere and guess what?

08:11.100 --> 08:14.166
I have no idea
what they're for or why.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.000
Absolutely no clue.

08:16.033 --> 08:18.600
Then it completely fell apart.
What did the doctor say?

08:18.633 --> 08:20.567
He says, "Well, what about
getting a prosthetic?"

08:20.600 --> 08:22.734
4,000 dollars later...

08:22.767 --> 08:24.633
[laughs]
[Dubrow]
Let's see it.

08:24.667 --> 08:27.100
What the hell is that?
Oh, it's just a tip.

08:27.133 --> 08:28.633
[Dubrow] Do you wear this?
[Clayton]
She's never used it at all.

08:28.667 --> 08:30.600
What are your goals?

08:30.633 --> 08:32.433
To have two nostrils.

08:32.467 --> 08:33.667
[Nassif]
What about
the right side?

08:33.700 --> 08:35.166
The right nostril.
Is it collapsed in?

08:35.200 --> 08:37.000
Yeah, if I could have
that bowed out

08:37.033 --> 08:39.100
even more to look like
that side,
that would be great.

08:39.133 --> 08:40.533
We just have to see
what really is available

08:40.567 --> 08:42.200
for our options.
Okay.

08:42.233 --> 08:44.667
Let's go to
the examination room.
Alright.

08:44.700 --> 08:47.367
My biggest fear is that
they're gonna tell me

08:47.400 --> 08:49.000
there is not enough
there to work with.

08:49.033 --> 08:50.367
"There is nothing
we can do for you."

08:54.233 --> 08:56.600
Just be brave.
We named him Daddy.

08:56.633 --> 08:59.500
Oh, Daddy's big!
[laughs]

09:00.567 --> 09:02.133
Okay,
so your septum is gone.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.166
You lost
the entire septum?

09:04.200 --> 09:06.734
There is literally nothing
left in Laura's nose.

09:06.767 --> 09:09.633
I've never seen anything
like this in my career.

09:12.734 --> 09:14.767
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

09:16.200 --> 09:17.700
[Nassif]
...the nose, okay,

09:17.734 --> 09:19.433
so obviously
there's no support.

09:19.467 --> 09:21.500
Okay,
so your septum is gone.

09:21.533 --> 09:23.233
You lost
the entire septum?

09:23.266 --> 09:25.266
[Laura] Mm-hmm!
[Nassif] All the way back.

09:25.300 --> 09:27.033
Oh my...

09:28.266 --> 09:30.033
There's some tissue.

09:30.066 --> 09:31.433
[Dubrow]
There is literally nothing

09:31.467 --> 09:32.700
left in Laura's nose.

09:32.734 --> 09:36.066
No recognizable
anatomical structures.

09:36.100 --> 09:39.200
I've never seen anything
like this in my career.

09:39.233 --> 09:41.266
Let's see that puppy go in.
[Laura] Oh gosh...

09:41.300 --> 09:43.533
I hate this thing.

09:43.567 --> 09:45.600
And then it's hard
to get out.

09:45.633 --> 09:48.066
Oh yeah, that's weird.
[Clayton]
Yeah, see how it's so far in?

09:48.100 --> 09:50.734
[Dubrow] That doesn't work.
It slides back on me.

09:50.767 --> 09:52.700
I'm afraid I'm going to,
like, lose it.
It's going to go, like...

09:52.734 --> 09:54.467
You are gonna aspirate it.
Yeah, Jesus.
Absolutely.

09:54.500 --> 09:55.633
[Nassif] Laura's afraid

09:55.667 --> 09:57.233
of wearing this prosthesis.

09:57.266 --> 09:59.133
She thinks that she's gonna
actually gonna

09:59.166 --> 10:01.166
suck it back
and then swallow it.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.700
The reason why
she can do that

10:02.734 --> 10:04.667
is because
straight back from the nose

10:04.700 --> 10:07.133
goes all the way back
to the nasal pharynx,

10:07.166 --> 10:11.533
and then it goes straight
down to either your esophagus,

10:11.567 --> 10:13.200
where the food goes
and drink,

10:13.233 --> 10:15.300
or the lungs,
where air comes out.

10:15.333 --> 10:18.133
So, Laura's fears
are quite legitimate.

10:18.166 --> 10:20.567
So, the first doctor
was thinking about doing

10:20.600 --> 10:23.100
most likely a,
called a nasolabial flap.

10:23.133 --> 10:27.233
The problem with your nose is,
this tissue underneath here
is white.

10:27.266 --> 10:29.233
It doesn't look healthy.
Okay.

10:29.266 --> 10:31.266
It doesn't have its good...
its own good,
No.

10:31.300 --> 10:33.633
independent blood supply.
Okay.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.233
[Nassif]
I don't have the warm
and fuzzy feeling

10:35.266 --> 10:37.233
we're doing a nasolabial flap
on Laura.

10:37.266 --> 10:39.100
The tissue just
doesn't look good.

10:39.133 --> 10:40.734
The last thing I want to do
is subject her

10:40.767 --> 10:42.667
to having this big, ugly thing

10:42.700 --> 10:44.333
stuck in her face
for 4-to-6 weeks,

10:44.367 --> 10:46.066
and then watch it fail.

10:46.100 --> 10:48.200
But I can take a small
piece of rib,

10:48.233 --> 10:50.533
make an incision
on the right nostril,

10:50.567 --> 10:52.500
get that nostril
to push out a little bit.

10:52.533 --> 10:55.166
Mm-hmm.
And we have a guy

10:55.200 --> 10:57.033
who is
a professional at prostheses.

10:57.066 --> 10:58.667
He was in the CIA.
Mm-hmm.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.166
His career was made
to basically

11:01.200 --> 11:03.633
take someone
and make them recognizable.
Okay.

11:03.667 --> 11:05.133
Like in the movies.
[Laura]
Yep.

11:05.166 --> 11:06.700
And I'll bet you

11:06.734 --> 11:08.633
that he can fit
a prosthesis for you

11:08.667 --> 11:11.133
that will look 100 times better
than that prosthesis you have.

11:11.166 --> 11:12.300
Okay.
How's that?

11:12.333 --> 11:14.300
That would be great.

11:14.333 --> 11:16.033
That's my thought.

11:17.700 --> 11:19.367
It'd be awesome.

11:19.400 --> 11:22.033
No hold-ups.
[Nassif]
Yeah.

11:22.066 --> 11:24.233
[Laura]
Oh, that's great.
Let me have one of those.

11:24.266 --> 11:26.200
[Laura laughs emotionally]

11:26.233 --> 11:28.633
Oh...

11:28.667 --> 11:30.667
Seeing Dr. Nassif
even get emotional

11:30.700 --> 11:34.100
makes me feel like
I am in the right hands.

11:34.133 --> 11:35.667
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.233
Thank you so much.
Thanks.
Pleasure.

11:37.266 --> 11:38.667
Nice meeting you as well.
And then that, after that,

11:38.700 --> 11:40.100
you can throw that away.
Chuck it in the garbage.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.266
Or burn it.
[all laugh]

11:41.300 --> 11:43.033
Or burn it.
Yeah, burn it.

11:43.066 --> 11:44.100
Thank you so much.

11:48.233 --> 11:50.200
My name is Erica,
and I'm from Boise, Idaho.

11:50.233 --> 11:53.166
And I need help with these
lopsided, leaking ladies.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.166
One side looks like
a watermelon,

11:55.200 --> 11:57.133
and the other side
looks like a cantaloupe.

11:57.166 --> 12:00.000
And my left breast
has been leaking

12:00.033 --> 12:02.066
orange liquid
from the nipple.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.767
Growing up I was
a little bit of a tomboy,

12:04.000 --> 12:06.633
just wanting to go
dirt bike riding.

12:06.667 --> 12:10.033
At 19, I went in for
a routine doctor visit,

12:10.066 --> 12:13.300
and my doctor
found a breast lump
in my left breast.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.367
I've had it tested,
and it's benign.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.100
But my doctor at that point

12:17.133 --> 12:19.033
strongly suggested
that I get it removed.

12:19.066 --> 12:21.300
Going into the consultation
and talking about

12:21.333 --> 12:24.133
what it would mean
to get my breast lump removed,

12:24.166 --> 12:27.100
my ex decides to interject
and say,

12:27.133 --> 12:29.633
"Well, do you think we could
just do an implant, also?"

12:29.667 --> 12:34.133
And that was when
the conversation changed.

12:34.166 --> 12:40.300
It was, "Well, my ex-wife
was natural 34 DDD's,
and it was great."

12:40.333 --> 12:42.633
It was kind of blindsiding,
I was like, "Okay."

12:42.667 --> 12:45.633
It wasn't like he was,
you know, Brad Pitt himself.

12:45.667 --> 12:47.300
You kinda
cocked your head a little

12:47.333 --> 12:49.367
and thought, "Really?"
[laughs]

12:49.400 --> 12:51.333
Then the second
suggestion came,

12:51.367 --> 12:54.233
since, we were already
"under the knife,"

12:54.266 --> 12:59.066
to do some lipo,
and get a labiaplasty.

12:59.100 --> 13:02.066
I was in shock.
Once it became,

13:02.100 --> 13:05.300
"I really want you to do this
because I love you
and it'll be great for us,"

13:05.333 --> 13:08.000
that's when I kind of
jumped onboard with it.

13:08.033 --> 13:10.734
I wanted to be
what he wanted me to be.

13:10.767 --> 13:13.300
I was so young and so naive.

13:13.333 --> 13:15.767
Soon after surgery,
I started noticing

13:16.000 --> 13:18.433
that the left breast
was really hard.

13:18.467 --> 13:20.667
I had capsular contracture.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.367
Within three months,
I was under the knife again.

13:22.400 --> 13:25.400
After my second surgery,
I had capsulated again.

13:25.433 --> 13:28.433
My third surgery took
out my scar tissue

13:28.467 --> 13:31.166
and removed my breast implants.

13:31.200 --> 13:33.367
We wanted
to just start over, basically.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.467
I'd had my implants out
for a few months

13:35.500 --> 13:39.100
when I noticed that
on the left side

13:39.133 --> 13:41.767
I was already capsulating again
without an implant.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.633
At this point,
I'm 20 years old,

13:43.667 --> 13:48.100
and my whole body image
is a wreck.

13:48.133 --> 13:49.700
My chest was concaved.

13:49.734 --> 13:52.400
You could see
where my old implants were.

13:52.433 --> 13:55.433
It was saggy and deflated.

13:55.467 --> 13:59.734
And that's when I decided
that I wanted to have
implants back in.

13:59.767 --> 14:02.033
Two-to-three months
after surgery,

14:02.066 --> 14:03.767
I knew something was wrong.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.033
I saw that my breast lump
was still there.

14:08.066 --> 14:11.500
Because it's protruding on
the side of my left breast.

14:11.533 --> 14:15.133
It hangs out on the side of it
because it's really large.

14:15.166 --> 14:17.033
He never took it out.

14:17.066 --> 14:19.467
I was overwhelmed with fear,

14:19.500 --> 14:21.266
and feeling like,

14:21.300 --> 14:23.333
"Oh my gosh,
what have we done?"

14:23.367 --> 14:25.667
Nothing turned out the way
that it was supposed to.

14:25.700 --> 14:29.000
I started
really seeing the effects

14:29.033 --> 14:31.000
of being in
a toxic relationship.

14:31.033 --> 14:35.033
I needed to have
the courage to leave,

14:35.066 --> 14:36.400
and I did it.

14:36.433 --> 14:37.767
I just left.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.166
I think that getting fixed...

14:40.200 --> 14:42.300
Mm-hmm.
...will help me
feel like I can

14:42.333 --> 14:44.266
just finally just move on

14:44.300 --> 14:46.467
and just let it go.
Yeah.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.266
[Wendi]
When I first saw her breast,

14:48.300 --> 14:50.033
I was in shock.

14:50.066 --> 14:52.033
I know it's something
she worries about

14:52.066 --> 14:54.166
and thinks about
and cries about.

14:54.200 --> 14:57.367
I am really thankful
she's doing something about it.

14:57.400 --> 15:00.333
It's been seven years
since I've even

15:00.367 --> 15:02.033
talked to a surgeon.

15:02.066 --> 15:03.300
You can't keep going on

15:03.333 --> 15:06.200
with your leaking
and your cyst.

15:06.233 --> 15:07.767
It's a real worry.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.233
[Erica]
Right now, my left breast

15:10.266 --> 15:12.500
just started
leaking orange liquid

15:12.533 --> 15:15.100
from the nipple from my lump.

15:15.133 --> 15:16.400
And I want it out.

15:16.433 --> 15:18.734
Just I'm so terrified about it.

15:18.767 --> 15:21.166
Yeah, I bet.

15:27.166 --> 15:29.533
It's definitely
so different.
I haven't seen any,

15:29.567 --> 15:32.000
like, beauty blogger,
beauty guru people...
Yeah. Absolutely.

15:32.033 --> 15:34.200
Like, this is definitely
going to set the level
and break the internet.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.300
Your fans are going
to be obsessed with this.

15:36.333 --> 15:38.166
Yeah.
This is something they've
never seen you do before.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.500
[Demi]
Today I'm doing
this amazing photoshoot

15:40.533 --> 15:44.066
to just kind of stir up
some social media buzz.

15:44.100 --> 15:46.233
Just be brave.
We named him Daddy.

15:46.266 --> 15:49.200
Oh, Daddy's big.
[laughs]

15:49.233 --> 15:50.767
Oh, my God,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.367
it's so cringeworthy,
having the snake wrapped

15:53.400 --> 15:57.133
around my neck
and my shoulders and arms, ugh!

15:57.166 --> 16:00.166
[female]
Yes, gorgeous.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.467
Oh, that's hot.
That's good.

16:02.500 --> 16:05.367
Ah, he's licking my finger.
You got it, just pose.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.400
[Elle]
La Demi being open
about her transition

16:07.433 --> 16:09.133
is why she is fearless
the way she is.

16:09.166 --> 16:12.166
[laughs] None of those.
[man] I'm really scared now.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.233
She gets to walk around
every day and really show people
that as long as you're yourself,

16:15.266 --> 16:17.467
that's what everybody else
is going to be inspired
to do as well.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.166
He's really loving these tits.

16:21.166 --> 16:24.033
I'm looking forward to seeing
Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif,

16:24.066 --> 16:25.500
to see what they think
about my chin.

16:25.533 --> 16:27.367
I have
all my tricks up my sleeve

16:27.400 --> 16:29.300
to look the best
I can look on camera,

16:29.333 --> 16:31.066
but I'm at
a point now where

16:31.100 --> 16:32.433
I just want
my chin to get fixed.

16:32.467 --> 16:34.266
Let's get it done.

16:34.300 --> 16:35.600
I think that this is a wrap.

16:35.633 --> 16:38.633
Can we get her, him,
whatever it is, off first?

16:38.667 --> 16:41.200
[laughs]
He looks like he likes you.

16:41.233 --> 16:43.533
He was cute while it lasted.

16:43.567 --> 16:46.400
[Erica]
Went to the routine doctor
and found a breast lump.

16:46.433 --> 16:48.433
Once we found out that
we were going to go
under the knife,

16:48.467 --> 16:52.400
my ex said,
"Well, hey, let's do
a breast implant."

No. Was I talking about you?
You're so transparent.

17:25.467 --> 17:27.767

you were going to say that.
You mean I'm so obvious.

[laughs]

17:47.567 --> 17:50.467
[sighs]
Ooh, our next patient
is named Erica.

17:50.500 --> 17:53.533
Pretty eyes. Oh!
Oh my goodness.
What happened?

17:53.567 --> 17:57.567
So, Erica has
a severe deformity
in her left breast.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.333
Will you please
send in Erica?

18:01.000 --> 18:02.433
Hi.
Hi. Doctor Nassif.

18:02.467 --> 18:03.600
Great to meet you. Erica.

18:03.633 --> 18:05.667
I have a pretty bad problem

18:05.700 --> 18:07.500
with my leakage in my lump.

18:07.533 --> 18:08.600
It's alarming,

18:08.633 --> 18:10.533
and so I'm nervous to hear

18:10.567 --> 18:12.433
if the doctor's gonna
be able to do something.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.367
So take us
back to the beginning

18:14.400 --> 18:16.367
with your first breast surgery,
if you wouldn't mind.

18:16.400 --> 18:19.767
Yeah, I was 19
and went to the routine doctor,

18:20.000 --> 18:22.767
and he found a breast lump
that they felt
was a little abnormal.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Oh.
And so they wanted
me to take it out.

18:26.033 --> 18:29.700
At the time
I was in a really toxic,
unhealthy relationship,

18:29.734 --> 18:33.200
and once we found out that
we were going to
go under the knife,

18:33.233 --> 18:36.300
my ex kind of interjected
and said,

18:36.333 --> 18:38.533
"Well, hey, let's do
a breast implant."

18:38.567 --> 18:40.567
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.300
What?
Wait, what?

18:42.333 --> 18:43.633
Didn't you just start
by telling us

18:43.667 --> 18:45.333
you had a mass, a lump?
I did.

18:45.367 --> 18:48.367
And that's kind when
it started to form into

18:48.400 --> 18:50.533
getting some lipo...

18:50.567 --> 18:53.467
and then three days
before my surgery,

18:53.500 --> 18:56.633
a labiaplasty
was put on the table.

18:56.667 --> 18:59.300
Yeah.
She came in with
a medical problem

18:59.333 --> 19:01.600
and came out with
a long laundry list

19:01.633 --> 19:03.633
of cosmetic
surgery procedures to do.

19:03.667 --> 19:06.266
Occasionally
in plastic surgery,

19:06.300 --> 19:08.000
a patient
is doing a procedure

19:08.033 --> 19:10.700
to make a relative
or a boyfriend happy.

19:10.734 --> 19:12.734
That's an enormous red flag.

19:12.767 --> 19:15.734
A plastic surgeon should
never operate on a patient

19:15.767 --> 19:17.500
under those circumstances.

19:17.533 --> 19:19.000
You were 19?
[Erica] Yeah.

19:19.033 --> 19:23.400
How old was he? Older?
He was 52.

19:23.433 --> 19:27.734
Oh. Wow. How did you like
her dating a 52-year-old guy?

19:27.767 --> 19:30.467
Well, she moved away when,

19:30.500 --> 19:33.233
right the day after
she graduated high school.

19:33.266 --> 19:35.600
It was devastating
when she left.

19:35.633 --> 19:38.000
I tried to
talk her out of it, but...

19:38.033 --> 19:40.333
she was young
and very impressionable.

19:40.367 --> 19:41.600
How did the surgery go?

19:41.633 --> 19:43.500
Well, about three months
after surgery,

19:43.533 --> 19:45.633
that's when I started
feeling a lot of scar tissue,

19:45.667 --> 19:47.500
a lot of hardness,
and so we went back in.

19:47.533 --> 19:51.533
They did a capsulectomy,
but pretty soon after

19:51.567 --> 19:53.600
we found that I was
encapsulating again

19:53.633 --> 19:56.600
and had
my breast implants out.

19:56.633 --> 19:59.467
The condition of my breasts
were just not good.

19:59.500 --> 20:02.300
And I was 20 years old
at that time,

20:02.333 --> 20:05.533
and I just felt like,
"I don't want to live
the rest of my life like this."

20:05.567 --> 20:10.467
And so, we decided to go under
and do implants again.

20:10.500 --> 20:13.467
Okay.
[Erica] And waking up
out of that surgery,

20:13.500 --> 20:16.433
it was a little weird,
because my lump's still there.

20:16.467 --> 20:18.066
And so...
Your lump's still there?

20:18.100 --> 20:20.633
Yes. It's not fully removed
'cause it protrudes.

20:20.667 --> 20:23.100
And so, when I push
on this one direction,

20:23.133 --> 20:25.400
it will discharge
from my nipple.
[Dubrow] Every day?

20:25.433 --> 20:27.667
Every day.
Wow.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.567
Erica's story
is pretty incredible.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.700
Not only does she have
a serious cosmetic issue,

20:32.734 --> 20:37.467
she actually has a serious
medical, functional issue.

20:37.500 --> 20:41.000
And it's very important that
the medical functional component

20:41.033 --> 20:43.734
be addressed
far before the cosmetic.

20:43.767 --> 20:48.000
So, what it I told you
that breast implants
may not be for you?

20:48.033 --> 20:50.700
It's terrifying
because I remember
what it was like without them.

20:50.734 --> 20:53.567
You know in medicine,
we occasionally get
one of those problems

20:53.600 --> 20:55.600
that we can't figure out.

20:56.734 --> 20:58.633
We don't know
what to do, exactly.

20:58.667 --> 21:00.700
Except we know
we need to back off.

21:00.734 --> 21:05.333
Back off
putting the things in you
that upset your body.

21:05.367 --> 21:07.567
Sure.
Anyway, why don't we go
and have a look?

21:07.600 --> 21:09.033
Because this is
a strange story,

21:09.066 --> 21:10.533
we have things
to figure out.

21:10.567 --> 21:12.300
Okay?
Great.

21:12.333 --> 21:14.133
I hope that
I can keep my implants.

21:14.166 --> 21:16.567
It's scary to think about
having them out

21:16.600 --> 21:19.567
because I flash back to

21:19.600 --> 21:21.633
what it was like
without my implants

21:21.667 --> 21:25.567
and feeling so sunken in
and concave

21:25.600 --> 21:28.033
that it was a moment
and a place

21:28.066 --> 21:29.633
where I never
want to go back to.

21:29.667 --> 21:32.400
So, we need to figure out
what's going on

21:32.433 --> 21:35.767
with that nipple discharge.
So, where is the lump?

21:36.000 --> 21:37.533
It's right here.

21:39.367 --> 21:40.633
You can feel it.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.600
And that's where
the lump was originally?

21:42.633 --> 21:44.633
Yeah.
Feel it, feel this mass here.

21:46.500 --> 21:51.000
So, when this mass is squeezed
or manipulated, you get a...

21:51.033 --> 21:52.467
You get a liquid out of here?
A discharge?

21:52.500 --> 21:54.100
Yeah, if I push
from this direction,

21:54.133 --> 21:56.567
I get it.
Push. Let me see.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.467
[Nassif]
Yep.

21:58.500 --> 22:00.500
[Dubrow] It's cloudy.
[Erica] Yeah. It's very cloudy.

22:00.533 --> 22:03.467
[Dubrow]
Nipple discharge can be
a benign finding,

22:03.500 --> 22:06.734
or a signal of something
very significant

22:06.767 --> 22:08.734
underlying the breast tissue.

22:08.767 --> 22:12.166
I've seen it before, but it's
almost never a good sign.

22:12.200 --> 22:16.100
You need to have
these implants removed,

22:16.133 --> 22:18.633
that breast explored,

22:18.667 --> 22:20.667
and see if we can determine

22:20.700 --> 22:24.767
what is going on with the lump
and the nipple discharge.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.500
[Erica]
Okay.
At that time,

22:27.533 --> 22:31.400
what I would love to do
is get you a good result
with no implants.

22:32.700 --> 22:35.767
But you have
a lot of breast tissue
to work with.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.166
There's a lot
of good stuff going on.
Okay.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.667
But right now,
you have a problem.

22:40.700 --> 22:43.700
And we need to be
problem solvers. Right?
Good.

22:43.734 --> 22:45.500
Yes. Healthy.
Good.

22:45.533 --> 22:47.367
Healthy. Okay?
More important.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.066
[Dubrow]
The most important thing
is healthy...

22:49.100 --> 22:51.667
Having my breast implants out

22:51.700 --> 22:54.433
will be an interesting road.

22:54.467 --> 22:57.633
I'm not sure exactly
how I'll feel afterwards.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.633
I really just need to see
what that looks like.

22:59.667 --> 23:01.633
A pleasure meeting you.
Nice to meet you.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
And to get a really good look,
I gotta get this waxed.

Good morning!
This is the infamous

Come close. Get in here.
Get over here, it's okay.

He's-- come, he's being
a little shy this morning.

25:27.433 --> 25:30.000
Here's our plan.
First, what we're going to do is

25:30.033 --> 25:31.700
we're going to get you
under anesthesia.

25:31.734 --> 25:35.066
He needs me to create
some things called undercuts,

25:35.100 --> 25:38.333
or areas where
the actual prosthesis
can sit,

25:38.367 --> 25:42.133
so that when you do go...
[sniffs], it doesn't

25:42.166 --> 25:44.066
go all the way back
and you swallow it.
Right.

[Nassif]
Robert is
looking for undercuts.

25:46.133 --> 25:48.033
And these are like
little shelves

25:48.066 --> 25:49.700
of her natural anatomy

25:49.734 --> 25:52.767
that the prosthetic device
can actually lock onto.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.166
No one is going to see anything
under here.

25:56.200 --> 25:59.433
The silicone
is going to look
exactly like your skin.

25:59.467 --> 26:02.066
Today has absolutely nothing
to do with function,

26:02.100 --> 26:04.633
because everything
inside of Laura's nose
is gone.

26:04.667 --> 26:07.400
Our goal is to gently
elevate the right nostril

26:07.433 --> 26:11.367
and give the base of the nose
a little bit more curvature
on the right side.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.133
Let's get this show
on the road.

26:18.667 --> 26:21.133
[Nassif]
For Laura's surgery today,
my team and I

26:21.166 --> 26:22.700
will harvest
rib and ear cartilage

26:22.734 --> 26:24.400
for composite
alar batten grafts

26:24.433 --> 26:26.266
to round out her right nostril.

26:26.300 --> 26:28.400
I will then create undercuts,
or ridges,

26:28.433 --> 26:30.400
in the two lower quadrants
of the nose

26:30.433 --> 26:32.467
so her prosthesis
will fit securely

26:32.500 --> 26:35.133
when applied in the future,
hopefully giving Laura

26:35.166 --> 26:37.033
the appearance
of a complete nose

26:37.066 --> 26:38.734
See this right here?
I see that.

26:38.767 --> 26:41.400
That's the base
of the bone.
Right.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.266
Right there.
Mm-hmm.

26:43.300 --> 26:46.700
If I was going to create
something for you...
Here.

26:46.734 --> 26:48.400
I don't really
need anything here.

26:48.433 --> 26:51.000
See this right here?
There's an undercut
right there.

26:51.033 --> 26:53.200
That's what I was looking for.
See that?

26:53.233 --> 26:56.166
So, there's a depression
against the foot of the nose.
That's... yes.

26:56.200 --> 26:59.233
That's good because
it won't come out, okay?
Just there.

26:59.266 --> 27:00.767
There's an undercut here.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.500
It's a smaller one
over here.
Yep.

27:02.533 --> 27:04.266
But that's enough.
It's fine.

27:04.300 --> 27:06.200
So you don't need me
to surgically create

27:06.233 --> 27:08.133
a depression for you
anywhere else, right?
No.

27:08.166 --> 27:10.166
All right,
that's good news.

27:10.200 --> 27:13.300
I'm so relieved that Robert was
able to find areas of undercut

27:13.333 --> 27:15.700
inside Laura's nose,
and that's all he needs

27:15.734 --> 27:19.033
to secure and fixate
the prosthesis.

27:19.066 --> 27:22.033
Now I can move on
with Laura's surgery
on her nostril.

27:22.066 --> 27:25.533
So, we've started harvesting
the composite graft.

27:25.567 --> 27:28.066
[male assistant]
Yep...

27:28.100 --> 27:29.700
I'm going to open up
the incision for the nose.

27:29.734 --> 27:31.166
Are you down to the rib now?

27:31.200 --> 27:34.000
May need a little
osteotome action.

27:34.033 --> 27:36.333
[Nassif]
It's never a good sign

27:36.367 --> 27:40.000
when I hear you
taking out the mallet
to remove a piece of rib.

27:40.033 --> 27:42.133
You gotta be careful,
because one little wrong move,

27:42.166 --> 27:45.033
you can enter the lung space
and collapse the lung.

27:47.533 --> 27:49.100
Did it go through it?

27:49.133 --> 27:51.333
Half way.
Oh, my God.

27:53.467 --> 27:55.166
Rib's about to come out.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.533
Ooh, a little,
cute little rib.

27:58.567 --> 28:00.467
It's a piece
that's calcified,

28:00.500 --> 28:03.200
which means
it is a lot harder
to cut through.

28:03.233 --> 28:08.066
A rib becomes calcified
usually either by trauma
or older age,

28:08.100 --> 28:13.166
making it incredibly difficult
to carve it into long,
thin pieces

28:13.200 --> 28:15.567
which is what we need
for alar batten grafts.

28:17.266 --> 28:19.200
We're making the pocket
for the batten graft

28:19.233 --> 28:22.333
that's going to make the nostril
pop out a little bit more

28:22.367 --> 28:24.400
to make it match
the one on the left.

28:24.433 --> 28:27.367
Let's just slide that
properly in.

28:27.400 --> 28:30.166
Do you have a small sliver
of cartilage?
Yeah.

28:30.200 --> 28:33.100
So, I'm putting two pieces
in here.
Okay.

28:33.133 --> 28:34.300
Okay. That one is better.

28:34.333 --> 28:36.567
So, two pieces
of cartilage in.

28:36.600 --> 28:39.166
All right.
So, we're done.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.467
Thank you, everybody.

28:46.066 --> 28:47.233
[Nassif]
I have a patient for you.

28:47.266 --> 28:49.400
All right.
Tell me, who is this?

28:49.433 --> 28:51.767
[Dubrow]
It looks like Kim Kardashian.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.266
I mean, that really does
look like Kim Kardashian.

28:57.033 --> 28:59.100
No way. Wow.

28:59.133 --> 29:01.266
Very impressive.
Let's see her.
Very impressive.

29:01.300 --> 29:03.233
Can you please
send in La Demi?

29:03.266 --> 29:05.133
Hello.

29:05.166 --> 29:07.100
Hello, Demi,
how are you?
Hi ya.

29:07.133 --> 29:10.266
I did not realize
how short Dr. Nassif was.

29:10.300 --> 29:13.333
I was looking down at him,
like, "Hi. Hi." [laughs]

29:13.367 --> 29:16.133
So, you're trying to be
a look-alike Kim Kardashian?

29:16.166 --> 29:18.266
Oh no. Absolutely not.
That's what we thought.

29:18.300 --> 29:19.500
Yeah, in that photo,
Really?

29:19.533 --> 29:21.166
you look just like her.
Just like her.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.100
That's funny,
because everywhere that I do go,

29:23.133 --> 29:25.266
people say,
"Oh, you must be related
to the Kardashians."

29:25.300 --> 29:27.033
I say, "Absolutely not."

29:27.066 --> 29:28.333
Oh, you don't want to be?
[Demi]
No, no, no!

29:28.367 --> 29:30.100
Nothing against--
I love the Kardashians,

29:30.133 --> 29:31.500
but of course,
I want to be my own self.

29:31.533 --> 29:33.133
So, we also saw
a picture of you

29:33.166 --> 29:34.433
before this transformation.

29:34.467 --> 29:37.000
Yes. I am transgender,
of course.

29:37.033 --> 29:39.467
And I did have
an amazing journey
and it's still going.

29:39.500 --> 29:42.100
I said, "Let me sit down
with the camera,
and take this to YouTube."

29:42.133 --> 29:44.233
So, I started
my YouTube channel, Fashion...

29:44.266 --> 29:46.333
Did you do
your transformation also

29:46.367 --> 29:50.166
from any type of surgery
on your YouTube page too?
Yes.

29:50.200 --> 29:53.166
She's very open
on her YouTube channel.
Very brave.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.066
[Nassif]
I respect what Demi
is trying to do.

29:55.100 --> 29:57.100
She is an advocate

29:57.133 --> 30:00.200
for everybody else
who wants to be
who they want to be

30:00.233 --> 30:02.433
but possibly afraid
of saying it.

30:02.467 --> 30:04.266
So, you know what?
You go, girl.

30:04.300 --> 30:06.367
So, you're
a big advocate of...

30:06.400 --> 30:09.433
If you are, be who...
Who cares.

30:09.467 --> 30:11.300
Just, you have a name.
Be yourself.

30:11.333 --> 30:13.500
I think the take-home message
is, to be honest,

30:13.533 --> 30:17.233
you can stop
shaving your back.
Stop doing it.

30:17.266 --> 30:19.367
Stop it.
Stop it.
You don't need to.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.500
You know, it's disgusting,
you have a hairy back,
it's good.

30:21.533 --> 30:23.600
[Elle] Relax.
I think we should
have a back-hair

30:23.633 --> 30:25.300
coming out party.

30:25.333 --> 30:27.400
I'll host it.
[Elle laughs]

30:27.433 --> 30:29.433
So when did
the surgical dabbling start?

30:29.467 --> 30:31.433
Not until last year,
and I was like, okay,

30:31.467 --> 30:34.233
I am finally ready
to, you know, get breasts.

30:34.266 --> 30:36.567
[Dubrow] Okay.
Tracheal shave, and my jaw.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.467
What do they do
with the jaw?
[Demi] Just shave it.

30:38.500 --> 30:39.700
Make it more rounded.

30:39.734 --> 30:41.467
But I feel
I don't really see that.

30:41.500 --> 30:44.133
I would definitely want
my chin fixed.

30:44.166 --> 30:46.533
I feel like it's very square,
it could be more,
like, narrow.

30:46.567 --> 30:48.333
You ever had Botox right here
in the masseter muscle?

30:48.367 --> 30:50.500
Yes, to try
relaxing the muscle.

30:50.533 --> 30:53.633
So, the best way
for us to say,
"Okay, we can help."

30:53.667 --> 30:55.367
Gotta go examine you.
Yeah.

30:55.400 --> 30:57.100
So let me go do that
right now.
Okay.

30:59.100 --> 31:00.600
Ew!
Look at this gross fluid!

31:00.633 --> 31:03.667
It's like someone threw up
inside of her breast.

31:03.700 --> 31:06.467
When you do this
aggressive type of surgery,

31:06.500 --> 31:08.500
you have a high risk
of injuring that nerve.

31:13.266 --> 31:14.767
♪ I want to be perfect ♪

31:16.467 --> 31:18.233
[Nassif]
Do me a favor. Can you, uh...

31:18.266 --> 31:20.667
Can you move across your hair
so we can look at your forehead?

31:20.700 --> 31:22.600
Just move your hair
out of the way.

31:22.633 --> 31:25.433
I'm just kidding. [laughs]
Move it. Behind your ears there.

31:25.467 --> 31:28.633
So you want to actually
tighten up here too,
or just up here?

31:28.667 --> 31:32.433
Altogether,
I want it more narrow.
Okay.

31:32.467 --> 31:35.233
Where were the incisions made
for the jaw?
Underneath.

31:35.266 --> 31:37.600
Okay.
Yeah, I can feel already
some work right here.

31:37.633 --> 31:39.467
So they actually
probably drilled this down

31:39.500 --> 31:41.333
but your width is here.

31:41.367 --> 31:43.033
This would have to
become more narrow.

31:43.066 --> 31:44.767
Especially this is a little bit
more asymmetric,

31:45.000 --> 31:47.600
this came in a little bit more
than this.
Yeah, yeah.

31:47.633 --> 31:51.033
All right.
So, let's really talk,

31:51.066 --> 31:53.000
and make sure you know
what all this is about.

31:53.033 --> 31:55.300
Okay.
To do this,

31:55.333 --> 31:58.367
you have to actually slice
the different jaw
in different areas.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.266
And the risk with that is,

32:00.300 --> 32:02.300
there's a nerve
that goes right through here.

32:02.333 --> 32:04.033
And it exits right here.

32:04.066 --> 32:06.734
When you do this
aggressive type of surgery,

32:06.767 --> 32:09.233
you have a high risk
of injuring that nerve.

32:09.266 --> 32:11.467
You'll be numb.
You won't feel anything
if you're kissing someone.

32:11.500 --> 32:14.767
You'll have no sensation
to one side of the area
at all.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.734
Do I want feeling in my mouth?
Yes.

32:17.767 --> 32:22.333
Are you kidding me?
These juicy suckers
were made for kissing.

32:22.367 --> 32:24.467
There's also a nerve
that comes all the way down here

32:24.500 --> 32:26.633
that controls
your lower-lip movement.

32:26.667 --> 32:29.467
That nerve can be injured,
so when you smile,

32:29.500 --> 32:31.600
you'd have a crooked,
asymmetric smile.

32:31.633 --> 32:34.567
That's not attractive.
So, that is a big surgery.

32:34.600 --> 32:37.000
I'm at the peak
of my career right now,
so I wouldn't be able to

32:37.033 --> 32:38.500
do such an insane surgery...
Yes.

32:38.533 --> 32:40.467
You'd be out of whack
for a couple of months.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.400
Oh wow.
I don't post for one week,
and it's like,

32:42.433 --> 32:44.300
"Where is she?"
Well, this will be longer,

32:44.333 --> 32:45.633
and plus, she won't really
be able to talk that well.

32:45.667 --> 32:47.567
Not worth it.

32:47.600 --> 32:49.734
I mean, right now,
you look amazing.
Yeah, I don't think

32:49.767 --> 32:52.467
you need the shaving,
the big operation...

32:52.500 --> 32:54.367
The things with
the nerves in the jaw,

32:54.400 --> 32:55.667
it's scary, honestly,

32:55.700 --> 32:58.000
because one thing can go wrong,

32:58.033 --> 32:59.767
and then I'm changed forever.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.600
It's interesting, because,
you know,

33:01.633 --> 33:04.266
you are so feminine already,

33:04.300 --> 33:06.533
even though you had to
make changes,

33:06.567 --> 33:09.000
and transition
in your own way,

33:09.033 --> 33:14.533
you help people be the person
they were supposed to be.

33:14.567 --> 33:17.433
I'm inspired,
and it's great to meet you.
Thank you.

33:17.467 --> 33:22.433
Dr. Dubrow makes me so proud
because he sees past
all the glam and the glitz

33:22.467 --> 33:24.633
and really understands
my presence online

33:24.667 --> 33:26.700
and the lives I'm trying to save
around the world,

33:26.734 --> 33:28.767
and just being you,
and being authentic.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.600
Bye, guys.
Bye, guys.
Thank you.

33:35.567 --> 33:36.734
[Dubrow] Hi, Erica.
[Erica] Hi.

33:36.767 --> 33:38.433
How are you?
Good, how are you?

33:38.467 --> 33:39.467
Good.

33:39.500 --> 33:42.367
So, this surgery today

33:42.400 --> 33:44.533
needs the A-game.

33:44.567 --> 33:46.734
Good, you better
bring it.
Yeah.

33:52.066 --> 33:53.700
[Dubrow]
For Erica's surgery today,

33:53.734 --> 33:56.100
I will make incisions
below her areolas

33:56.133 --> 33:58.600
remove her implants,
and assess the pockets.

33:58.633 --> 34:01.033
I will then take out
the breast mass

34:01.066 --> 34:04.667
and release scar tissue
in the lower portion
of the left breast.

34:04.700 --> 34:07.700
Finally, I will perform
a breast lift on both sides,

34:07.734 --> 34:11.734
leaving Erica with
two symmetrical,
implant-free breasts.

34:11.767 --> 34:14.133
Okay, so the first thing
we are going to do

34:14.166 --> 34:18.000
is go in and remove
these implants
and assess the pockets.

34:19.734 --> 34:24.667
So, the right breast pocket
is pretty normal looking,
which is good.

34:24.700 --> 34:27.734
All right,
now let's go after
the other side.

34:27.767 --> 34:30.333
As part of Erica's
preoperative workup,

34:30.367 --> 34:33.333
I've ordered
an ultrasound-guided
needle biopsy of the lump

34:33.367 --> 34:35.133
to make sure
it's not malignant.

34:35.166 --> 34:37.166
The good news is it's not.

34:37.200 --> 34:39.767
But I'm still going to
take the lump out

34:40.000 --> 34:43.367
in hopes that it will
clear up the orange fluid
coming from the nipple.

34:43.400 --> 34:46.367
Ew!
Look at this gross fluid
that's coming out of here.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.066
Can I have a syringe?

34:48.100 --> 34:49.633
Here.
Thank you.

34:54.433 --> 34:57.133
It's like someone threw up
inside of her breast.

34:57.166 --> 34:59.433
Okay, so, I'm going to
take this implant out,

34:59.467 --> 35:02.433
which is, ugh,
look at that!
Ew.

35:02.467 --> 35:07.066
It's like this...
slime ball. Ugh!

35:07.100 --> 35:09.700
Erica's left breast
is clearly unhappy.

35:09.734 --> 35:13.133
And if anything is certain
with this case, it's two things.

35:13.166 --> 35:16.533
One, the fact that the implants
are not her friend.

35:16.567 --> 35:19.767
And two, this breast mass
needs to come out.

35:22.533 --> 35:25.767
Well, that feels like a mass.
Feel that, Heidi.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.467
Coming out.

35:27.500 --> 35:30.133
[suctioning]

35:30.166 --> 35:32.200
This has got it
pretty cleaned out.
What's that?

35:32.233 --> 35:33.467
What?
Right there.

35:34.734 --> 35:36.533
What the [bleep]
is this?

35:36.567 --> 35:38.533
More mysteries.
Can you see that?

35:38.567 --> 35:40.533
I... Oh.

35:40.567 --> 35:42.133
What the hell
is that thing?

35:42.166 --> 35:43.567
Look at that. It's almost
like a...

35:43.600 --> 35:46.133
cold sore.
Let's take this out.

35:46.166 --> 35:48.233
After removing
Erica's breast mass,

35:48.266 --> 35:52.500
we found another
suspicious mass
inside of her left breast.

35:52.533 --> 35:55.667
But this is nothing like
one I've ever seen before.

35:55.700 --> 35:56.700
[suctioning]

35:56.734 --> 35:58.233
What is that?

35:58.266 --> 36:00.500
What does it feel like?

36:00.533 --> 36:03.433
Like a rubbery...
lima bean.

36:06.066 --> 36:08.567
Vascular, too.
Weird.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.166
Have we, have we ever
seen anything like that?
No.

36:12.567 --> 36:15.567
First there's vomit.
Then there's this.

36:15.600 --> 36:19.166
All right. Let's start stapling,
see if we can find a shape.

36:19.200 --> 36:22.266
Now that we've taken care of
Erica's health issues
with her breast,

36:22.300 --> 36:25.233
I can focus on
the cosmetic issues.

36:25.266 --> 36:28.166
I think she has
enough breast tissue

36:28.200 --> 36:31.066
that I can give her
a good size and shape

36:31.100 --> 36:34.500
without using implants
and just do a breast lift.

36:34.533 --> 36:37.033
Yeah!

36:37.066 --> 36:41.734
Huh? Huh? Let's close.
We're done.

36:46.734 --> 36:48.300
[Barron] Well, hello.
[Nassif] How are you?

36:48.333 --> 36:50.066
Hello, hello.
Hi, guys.

36:50.100 --> 36:52.633
I want to take a look
at the graft.
Sure.

36:52.667 --> 36:54.533
How's your ear, too?
Let's take the temperature
of your ear.

36:54.567 --> 36:56.066
Everything's...
Everything's healed.

36:56.100 --> 36:57.600
I'm really excited
for Laura,

36:57.633 --> 36:59.200
because today is the day

36:59.233 --> 37:01.767
that Robert Barron
is gonna make the mold

37:02.000 --> 37:03.600
for Laura's prosthetic nose.

37:03.633 --> 37:06.266
Robert Barron used to be
in the CIA.

37:06.300 --> 37:08.533
So, he would do
these face swap things.

37:08.567 --> 37:12.734
So, in other words,
he can take my face,
put it on Terry,

37:12.767 --> 37:16.567
and then we would be
a ridiculously good-looking,

37:16.600 --> 37:19.166
handsome, plastic surgery team.

37:19.200 --> 37:21.633
The graft I put inside
your nose... Beautiful.

37:21.667 --> 37:25.266
Now the magic
is going to happen today
with Dr. Barron here.

37:25.300 --> 37:27.066
[Nassif] Okay.
[Dubrow]
What are you going to do?

37:27.100 --> 37:29.000
I am going to put silicone

37:29.033 --> 37:32.533
right here on the top, okay?

37:32.567 --> 37:36.133
Let that cure,
and then I'll fill the rest in

37:36.166 --> 37:38.667
with the silicone, okay?
Okay.

37:38.700 --> 37:40.600
So I can make
the prosthetic device

37:40.633 --> 37:43.667
when I get back to my lab.
Okay?
Okay. Yep.

37:43.700 --> 37:46.567
It's exciting that things
are going to change for me.

37:46.600 --> 37:49.266
The thought of having people
not stare at me anymore

37:49.300 --> 37:53.100
and having this prosthetic
that is going to
finish my nose off,

37:53.133 --> 37:54.767
it's very, very cool.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.567
[Barron]
Awesome.

37:58.600 --> 38:00.600
Now that Robert has made
the final touches

38:00.633 --> 38:02.633
on Laura's prosthetic mold,

38:02.667 --> 38:07.066
we're one step closer
to putting the
last puzzle piece in

38:07.100 --> 38:08.166
and completing it.

38:08.200 --> 38:09.333
Thank you.
Pleasure.

38:09.367 --> 38:10.700
We'll see you soon.
Okay.

38:12.734 --> 38:15.333
Oh wow. She looks so different.

38:15.367 --> 38:18.367

38:45.000 --> 38:48.333
I'm also nervous
to actually see how small I am.

38:48.367 --> 38:50.633
There were so many things
going on

38:50.667 --> 38:54.433
that were both interesting
and complicated...

38:54.467 --> 38:56.266
The story of my life.
Right?

38:56.300 --> 38:58.767
So, the right side was okay.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.467
Okay.
All right, the left side

39:00.500 --> 39:04.333
there was this orangey fluid

39:04.367 --> 39:07.200
in the pockets
surrounding the implant.

39:07.233 --> 39:10.433
Then I was on a hunt
for the mass.

39:10.467 --> 39:13.300
And we found it,
so I took that out.
Oh, good.

39:13.333 --> 39:16.333
And I found some funky things
inside of your pocket.

39:16.367 --> 39:18.767
I found this foreign body
reaction mass

39:19.000 --> 39:21.066
that I have never seen either,

39:21.100 --> 39:24.300
and it looked kind of like
a flattened gummy bear.

39:25.700 --> 39:27.333
No, it looked like a mint.

39:27.367 --> 39:29.266
You didn't eat my mass, did you,
that looked like a mint?

39:29.300 --> 39:31.000
No, I didn't eat it.
I didn't eat it.

It's good, right?

really good, too.

39:50.734 --> 39:52.467
But I'm also
really happy though,

39:52.500 --> 39:54.767
because instantly I can see

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
that they are the same size

39:57.033 --> 40:02.100

that Dr. Dubrow
has removed my lump.

I have waited for this moment

40:19.367 --> 40:22.100
since the first time
I went under the knife,

40:22.133 --> 40:24.300
but going in
for the wrong reasons

40:24.333 --> 40:27.033
was something
that I would never
suggest to anybody.

40:27.066 --> 40:30.000
Never go in under the knife
because someone's
pushing you to do it.

40:31.266 --> 40:33.200
Today, I am going on

40:47.367 --> 40:49.533
Before my surgery
with Dr. Dubrow,

40:49.567 --> 40:53.033
my breasts
were extremely asymmetrical
and misshapen.

40:53.066 --> 40:56.066
But now after my surgery,
my breasts finally feel normal.

40:56.100 --> 40:58.533
I no longer have
this leaking lump.

40:58.567 --> 41:02.166
I am ready to let go
of the hurt
from my past relationship

41:02.200 --> 41:04.133

How I will know
this prosthetic
is the right fit

41:23.133 --> 41:25.233
is, number one, that it's not
going to slide back

41:25.266 --> 41:27.767
into my nose
where I think it's going to
end up in my brain.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.033
And that it looks real,
and not like

41:30.066 --> 41:31.567
something that came out of

So, you could go

Yep.

falling out.

I can't thank you enough.
This has been...

The only thing is,
he's with the CIA.

42:16.233 --> 42:18.233
Right.
If you tell anybody about this,
he's going to have to kill you.

Yeah. It looks fantastic.

42:37.266 --> 42:39.467
You can't even tell.
It's beautiful.
You can't even tell anymore.

42:39.500 --> 42:42.266
[Laura] Before my surgery,
my nose was hollowed out
like a pumpkin.

42:42.300 --> 42:44.600
The right side had collapsed,
the nostrils were gone,

42:44.633 --> 42:47.166
and I was constantly
stared at in public.

42:47.200 --> 42:50.433
But thanks to Dr. Nassif
and Robert Barron,
I have two nostrils

42:50.467 --> 42:53.300
and a prosthetic
that fits securely,
and also looks great.

42:53.333 --> 42:56.500
Instead of a black hole,
I finally have a nose that
I don't mind people staring at.

42:56.533 --> 42:58.600
Hopefully now,
I won't embarrass
my teenage son.

42:58.633 --> 43:00.433
Aah!

43:00.467 --> 43:01.433
Too much.

43:01.467 --> 43:03.500
All right, guys, let's go!

43:05.333 --> 43:07.266
I have one nipple
that goes this way,

43:07.300 --> 43:09.300
one nipple that goes this way...

43:09.333 --> 43:11.533

Is that something
you hope will be fixed?

should have died.

43:21.467 --> 43:23.333
Oh, my God.

43:23.367 --> 43:25.333
I ended up
moving in with older men.

43:25.367 --> 43:27.300
Those relationships
were very abusive.

43:27.333 --> 43:29.500
Look at the way
the bones were fractured.

43:29.533 --> 43:31.433
There's a difference
between surgical trauma,

43:31.467 --> 43:32.600
and trauma
from another person.
