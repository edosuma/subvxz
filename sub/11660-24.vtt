Dorothy, what seven-letter word
means lonely, middle-aged woman

01:01.633 --> 01:03.000
desperate to meet men?

01:03.066 --> 01:05.333
Is that on your puzzle?

01:05.400 --> 01:09.233
No. I'm getting you a personalized
license plate for your car.

01:13.633 --> 01:15.033
Here you go, sweetheart.

01:15.100 --> 01:18.567
Dorothy, have you ever heard
of something called dirty dancing?

01:18.633 --> 01:21.533
Of course.
They did it in that movie.

01:21.600 --> 01:22.600
What movie?

01:22.667 --> 01:25.133
<i>Lawrence of Arabia, </i>Rose.

01:26.667 --> 01:30.667
This flyer says they're going
to start a dirty dancing course

01:30.734 --> 01:33.767
down at Lawson's dance studio.

01:33.834 --> 01:34.967
What do you say, Dorothy?

01:35.033 --> 01:38.200
Oh, no. I can't see myself
swinging my hips

01:38.266 --> 01:42.934
and wildly gyrating my pelvis.
I am not interested.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.934
And the world heaves a collective
sigh of relief.

01:50.100 --> 01:53.166
Rose,
you want to learn dirty dancing?

01:53.233 --> 01:54.834
I don't know.
For some odd reason,

01:54.900 --> 01:58.567
dirty dancing
always sounds dirty.

01:58.633 --> 02:02.533
Come on, Rose.
You know you like dancing.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.133
I like square dancing.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.467
This is just like square dancing.

02:06.533 --> 02:07.734
All right.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.667
Great!

02:09.734 --> 02:12.233
Just one thing,
when you do-si-do,

02:12.300 --> 02:15.834
your legs are wrapped around
your partner's neck.

02:19.433 --> 02:21.567
Look, a letter from my friends

02:21.633 --> 02:25.066
Philomena and Dominic Bosco
in Sicily.

02:25.133 --> 02:27.734
They're visiting Miami
and bringing their daughter Gina.

02:27.800 --> 02:28.600
Who's that?

02:28.667 --> 02:31.900
Gina and I were born
within minutes of each other

02:31.967 --> 02:33.934
at a Brooklyn hospital.

02:33.967 --> 02:38.367
Ma became friendly with Philomena
before they moved back to Sicily.

02:38.433 --> 02:40.367
Will they be staying here?

02:40.433 --> 02:43.633
Unless there's a bidding war
with the neighbors.

02:43.700 --> 02:47.800
Even if we lose,
at least they'll be close by.

02:50.367 --> 02:52.433
Don't worry.
They won't be any trouble.

02:52.500 --> 02:53.633
They'll all stay in my room.

02:53.700 --> 02:56.200
Three people in one bed?

02:56.266 --> 02:57.767
What'll the Bosco's say?

02:57.834 --> 03:00.633
If you throw in a goat, they'll say,
"This is just like home."

03:02.567 --> 03:06.834
(soft music playing)

03:07.333 --> 03:08.567
Hi, Ma.

03:08.633 --> 03:11.500
Here, Dorothy. I want to know
what you think of my pasta.

03:11.567 --> 03:14.467
It's for the Bosco's.
They'll be here any minute.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.500
Ma, this is awful!

03:22.033 --> 03:24.600
I'm also boiling the crud
off the sink-stopper.

03:32.367 --> 03:33.900
Try the other pot.

03:37.233 --> 03:38.600
Hello, Dorothy.

03:38.667 --> 03:41.934
-Hi, Sophia.
-Honey, how did the class go?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.867
Oh, not so bad, really.

03:43.934 --> 03:45.767
Although, it was harder
than I expected.

03:45.834 --> 03:49.266
But I'm sure I'll be able
to master the technique

03:49.333 --> 03:50.967
and absorb the subtleties.

03:51.033 --> 03:53.567
She stunk.

03:55.667 --> 03:58.867
But the teacher
said I was a natural.

03:58.934 --> 04:00.600
Let me get this straight,

04:00.667 --> 04:04.567
Blanche couldn't get the hang of it,
but you could?

04:04.633 --> 04:07.433
Dorothy, now do you see
why I'm so embarrassed?

04:07.500 --> 04:10.333
Can you imagine a dance
just like making love

04:10.400 --> 04:13.567
and I can't do it?

04:13.633 --> 04:14.867
Relax, Blanche.

04:14.934 --> 04:19.133
Maybe standing up
is what's throwing you.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.033
(doorbell rings)

04:26.100 --> 04:27.667
There are the Bosco's.

04:34.834 --> 04:38.500
-Philomena!
-Sophia!

04:49.633 --> 04:53.433
Oh, this is such a warm,
wonderful moment.

04:53.500 --> 04:57.433
I wish I spoke Italian
so I'd know what they were saying.

05:00.233 --> 05:03.600
So good to see you, Sophia.
So good to see...

05:05.000 --> 05:08.100
and this must be Dorothea.

05:08.166 --> 05:10.200
You know,
you probably don't remember,

05:10.266 --> 05:15.433
but 50 years ago,
I held you naked in my arms.

05:15.500 --> 05:18.100
And you peed on his suit.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.166
It's ok.

05:21.233 --> 05:24.000
Look.
You can hardly see it anymore.

05:28.533 --> 05:32.033
Let me introduce my friends.
Rose and Blanche.

05:32.100 --> 05:34.266
What a charming
old-world couple.

05:34.333 --> 05:35.700
Welcome to Miami.

05:35.767 --> 05:39.467
(speaking Italian)

05:39.533 --> 05:40.800
What's that?

05:40.867 --> 05:44.667
She says to thank you
for your gracious welcome.

05:44.734 --> 05:46.667
My Italian must really be rusty.

05:46.734 --> 05:49.633
I could swear she asked
if you were a streetwalker.

05:56.700 --> 05:59.433
Where is Gina?
Isn't she with you?

05:59.500 --> 06:03.000
She's outside.
She's bartering with the cabby.

06:03.066 --> 06:06.367
Imagine a man
who'd take cash over a rooster.

06:06.433 --> 06:09.667
Tell us what brings
you all to Florida.

06:09.734 --> 06:13.967
We're here to take our daughter
to Sicily for her wedding.

06:14.033 --> 06:16.300
But Gina came with you.

06:16.367 --> 06:20.433
Gina... is not our daughter.

06:20.500 --> 06:21.700
She's not?

06:21.767 --> 06:26.033
No. You are our daughter.

06:28.767 --> 06:30.200
Please ignore him.

06:30.266 --> 06:32.467
The man spent 90 days
on the high seas

06:32.533 --> 06:36.600
drinking grain alcohol
from a goat bladder.

06:36.667 --> 06:38.500
Dominic speaks the truth.

06:38.567 --> 06:40.800
After Gina take a blood test
for her marriage,

06:40.867 --> 06:44.700
we discover it's not possible
she's related to us.

06:44.767 --> 06:47.533
There must have been
some mix-up.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.266
They switched the babies?

06:49.333 --> 06:51.467
Oh, but this is ridiculous.

06:51.533 --> 06:54.700
Absolutely. We can prove it.

06:54.767 --> 06:57.934
Dorothy, show them
your driver's license.

07:02.367 --> 07:05.700
Look! Look,
I know this is a shock.

07:05.767 --> 07:08.700
But it gets better.

07:08.767 --> 07:10.367
You are getting married.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.567
To the most handsome man
in the village.

07:15.633 --> 07:17.800
(doorbell rings)

07:17.867 --> 07:20.066
Wait a minute.

07:20.133 --> 07:24.400
There's not one shred of evidence,
not one logical reason,

07:24.467 --> 07:27.934
why I should not believe
that this woman is my mother

07:28.000 --> 07:30.533
or that Gina is her real daughter.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.500
(doorbell rings)

07:34.834 --> 07:37.266
<i>Buon giorno.</i>
I'm Gina.

07:56.533 --> 07:59.133
Oh, Ma!
That's disgusting.

07:59.200 --> 08:03.100
Can't you find a better place
to clip your toenails?

08:03.166 --> 08:06.667
Don't call me ma.
My friends call me Sophia.

08:06.734 --> 08:10.533
Ma, I'm very upset,
so please stop teasing me.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.533
I've never told this
to anyone before.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.367
The day I left the hospital
with you,

08:15.433 --> 08:18.467
I had a gnawing feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

08:22.533 --> 08:24.734
Because you suspected a mix-up?

08:24.800 --> 08:29.367
No.
Because I was in labor for 38 hours.

08:29.433 --> 08:31.600
The doctor who delivered
you bought his obstetric tools

08:31.667 --> 08:34.000
from a restaurant supply store.

08:34.066 --> 08:36.867
Now stop talking crazy,
and go to bed.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.667
Good night.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.233
(coughing)

08:46.300 --> 08:48.000
Dorothy, you got a cough drop?

08:48.066 --> 08:49.066
No.

08:50.900 --> 08:52.300
A hard candy?

08:52.367 --> 08:53.867
-No.
-Tic tac?

08:53.934 --> 08:56.934
Does it say K-mart on the back
of my nightgown?

09:00.233 --> 09:03.367
As a matter of fact,
it does, you cheapskate.

09:12.967 --> 09:15.233
You know, Ma, I remember
when I was a little girl.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.700
Oh, God.

09:17.767 --> 09:19.800
I used to have these
terrible nightmares,

09:19.867 --> 09:22.233
you know, monsters in the closet.

09:22.300 --> 09:26.266
You'd let me sleep in your room.
Remember?

09:26.333 --> 09:31.166
I remember how you and pop
got me to stop crying.

09:31.233 --> 09:34.266
You'd put your arms
around me and say,

09:34.333 --> 09:38.333
"As long as you're in my arms,
everything's going to be ok."

09:40.100 --> 09:44.467
Ma, that's what I need now,
a parent to hug me

09:44.533 --> 09:47.100
and tell me everything's
going to be ok.

09:47.166 --> 09:50.100
Don't worry, baby.

09:50.166 --> 09:52.367
Everything is going to be
<i>molto bene.</i>

09:52.433 --> 09:54.500
Aah!

09:55.934 --> 09:58.233
What the hell is going on?

09:58.300 --> 09:59.967
I heard your voice.

10:00.033 --> 10:03.467
I wondered why my <i>bambina</i>
was up so late.

10:03.533 --> 10:05.066
Don't call me <i>bambina.</i>

10:05.133 --> 10:08.734
-Dominic, you wake up <i>bambina.</i>
-Stop saying that!

10:08.800 --> 10:13.233
Raise your voice at your mama,
I'll take you across my knee.

10:13.300 --> 10:18.066
Touch me, your teeth will get back
to Sicily before you.

10:18.133 --> 10:19.567
That's my girl!

10:19.633 --> 10:22.834
You got lots of spirit
like your beautiful mama.

10:22.900 --> 10:24.900
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

10:24.967 --> 10:26.500
It's gone far enough.

10:26.567 --> 10:27.900
-What?
-What?

10:27.967 --> 10:31.467
From now on,
she'll be ma number one,

10:31.533 --> 10:32.633
and you're ma number two.

10:32.700 --> 10:36.066
I think I'm slowly going
out of my mind.

10:36.133 --> 10:39.600
Enough! Tomorrow
I'll have a blood test

10:39.667 --> 10:41.567
and settle this mess
once and for all.

10:41.633 --> 10:42.567
<i>Capisce?</i>

10:42.633 --> 10:44.667
Now, go to bed!

10:46.633 --> 10:51.133
Oh, thank heaven this will all
be settled tomorrow.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.400
Thanks, Ma.

10:54.734 --> 10:55.967
I love you, Ma.

10:57.233 --> 10:58.066
Ma?

11:00.200 --> 11:02.533
-Ma?
-Are you talking to me?

11:06.767 --> 11:10.367
(mellow music playing)

11:10.433 --> 11:13.633
(serene music playing)

11:15.300 --> 11:17.300
-Look, Blanche--
-Don't speak to me.

11:17.367 --> 11:19.100
What you did was terrible.

11:19.166 --> 11:21.834
I've never been so humiliated.

11:21.900 --> 11:27.166
What about the time you got caught
with the Orkin man?

11:33.166 --> 11:35.200
Don't comfort me, Rose.

11:37.266 --> 11:39.533
What happened?

11:39.600 --> 11:41.633
Blanche and I went dancing.

11:41.700 --> 11:44.000
She was sure she could
out-dirty dance me,

11:44.066 --> 11:46.000
even though I am better in class.

11:46.066 --> 11:47.667
We went to a club.

11:47.734 --> 11:51.133
I got up first.
I was pretty good.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.667
Then Blanche got up.

11:52.734 --> 11:54.266
And she was bad?

11:54.333 --> 11:55.667
I couldn't tell.

11:55.734 --> 11:57.266
I was blinded by the reflection

11:57.333 --> 12:01.767
off some gold chains
on a guy named Nick,

12:01.834 --> 12:04.567
but I think the laughter
spoke for itself.

12:04.633 --> 12:05.900
That's enough.

12:05.967 --> 12:07.600
What are you doing up?

12:07.667 --> 12:10.300
Oh, I couldn't sleep.

12:10.367 --> 12:15.533
I just keep thinking about ma
and whose mother she really is.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.066
You're worried she's Gina's?

12:17.133 --> 12:20.233
No, I'm worried she might
be Phil Rizzuto's.

12:22.166 --> 12:24.200
I've noticed the phrase "holy cow"

12:24.266 --> 12:26.433
creeping into her conversation
a lot.

12:28.367 --> 12:31.333
You have nothing
to worry about.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.300
Of course, I do.

12:33.367 --> 12:37.266
I am confronting the possibility
that the woman I have lived with

12:37.333 --> 12:40.767
and known and loved
for my entire life

12:40.834 --> 12:42.734
may not even be my mother.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.667
That's exactly the point.

12:44.734 --> 12:48.166
What's the difference if she did
or didn't give birth to you?

12:48.233 --> 12:52.500
You two really know
and love each other

12:52.567 --> 12:56.166
a lot more than most mamas
and their children ever do.

12:56.233 --> 13:01.066
Nothing that has or will happen
can ever change that.

13:06.367 --> 13:12.500
(laughing and chattering in Italian)

13:16.333 --> 13:18.967
'Course, I could be wrong.

13:22.867 --> 13:26.300
(soft music playing)

13:28.200 --> 13:31.300
-Would you like a cup of coffee?
-No, thank you.

13:31.367 --> 13:34.066
The vending machine
gave me two by mistake.

13:34.133 --> 13:35.066
Hospitals.

13:35.133 --> 13:37.100
Nothing ever works
the way it's supposed to.

13:37.166 --> 13:38.800
Wait a minute.

13:38.867 --> 13:42.533
Just because a vending machine
screws up a cup of coffee

13:42.600 --> 13:44.900
doesn't mean the hospital
did anything wrong.

13:44.967 --> 13:48.433
Sure, a mistake
like mixing up two babies.

13:48.500 --> 13:49.867
Makes the headlines.

13:49.934 --> 13:52.600
But the point is,
statistics back me up,

13:52.667 --> 13:55.900
hospitals are remarkably
efficient institutions.

13:55.967 --> 13:58.800
I mean, seriously.

13:58.867 --> 14:01.433
How often does a hospital
mix up two babies?

14:01.500 --> 14:03.100
Have you ever heard
of such a thing?

14:03.166 --> 14:04.100
Well, have you?!

14:04.166 --> 14:06.667
Are you here
for the methadone program?

14:09.800 --> 14:12.433
I'm sorry.
I'm here for my mother.

14:12.500 --> 14:13.767
-Surgery?
-No.

14:13.834 --> 14:16.300
Blood test. You?

14:16.367 --> 14:19.300
I have someone
going into surgery.

14:19.367 --> 14:21.967
I can understand
why you'd be a little nervous.

14:22.033 --> 14:24.467
No matter how many times
you have to go through this,

14:24.533 --> 14:27.567
I guess you're never really
prepared for it.

14:27.633 --> 14:28.900
Look at me.

14:28.967 --> 14:31.867
My hands are shaking.
I'm sweating.

14:31.934 --> 14:33.800
My head is spinning.

14:33.867 --> 14:36.166
I wish I could be only
a little nervous.

14:36.233 --> 14:38.834
<i>Dr. Watkins to O.R.</i>
<i>Dr. Watkins to O.R.</i>

14:38.900 --> 14:42.033
Well, that's me. I have to run.

14:48.533 --> 14:52.333
What took so long?
They only drew a little blood.

14:52.400 --> 14:56.066
At my age, that's
like wildcat drilling for oil.

14:56.567 --> 14:59.033
When will you get
the blood test results?

14:59.100 --> 15:00.767
I'm a nervous wreck.

15:00.834 --> 15:02.767
In a few minutes. Relax.

15:02.834 --> 15:04.767
How can I relax?

15:04.834 --> 15:07.533
Any minute now,
somebody can walk in here

15:07.600 --> 15:10.133
and tell me you're
not really my mother.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.667
I'll set your mind at ease.

15:12.734 --> 15:14.200
Going to tell a story?

15:14.266 --> 15:17.533
No. I'm going to sing
a negro spiritual.

15:18.033 --> 15:19.500
Shut up and listen.

15:23.367 --> 15:25.767
Do you remember the first day
you went to school?

15:25.834 --> 15:27.934
No.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.967
You looked so adorable in that
pink and white polka dot dress,

15:31.033 --> 15:32.500
I loved that dress.

15:32.567 --> 15:36.667
Even after you outgrew it,
it was tucked away upstairs.

15:36.734 --> 15:39.500
You stored it
for sentimental reasons?

15:39.567 --> 15:41.600
No. Your brother Phil
hid it there.

15:43.033 --> 15:46.500
He used to like to wear it
when he visited the firehouse.

15:51.900 --> 15:55.433
Anyway, we got to the school,
and I walked into your classroom.

15:55.500 --> 15:56.567
I started to go.

15:56.633 --> 15:59.667
You cried, "Mommy, mommy,
I want mommy."

15:59.734 --> 16:01.400
The teacher told me to go,
so I did.

16:01.467 --> 16:06.934
I left you screaming, crying,
with tears pouring down your face.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.033
All kids do that
their first school day.

16:10.100 --> 16:13.000
No. You were the only one.

16:13.066 --> 16:15.233
It took a half hour
to calm you.

16:15.300 --> 16:18.867
That didn't last long.

16:18.934 --> 16:21.166
Every time the teacher
turned her back,

16:21.233 --> 16:23.533
little Debbie Tanzi did
something she shouldn't.

16:23.600 --> 16:27.900
Her mother was the same every time
her father turned his back.

16:27.967 --> 16:30.967
The woman was a real tramp.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.567
But you digress.

16:32.633 --> 16:36.734
Right. So, there's Debbie
putting gum in your hair,

16:36.800 --> 16:39.433
hiding your lunch, stealing your
toys when nobody's looking.

16:39.500 --> 16:43.367
I figure you'll never want
to go to school again.

16:43.433 --> 16:46.233
What do you say?
You love it.

16:46.300 --> 16:48.667
You made a new friend
named Debbie.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.667
Mom, what the hell does
this have to do,

16:53.734 --> 16:55.567
wait a minute.

16:55.633 --> 16:57.600
How did you know
what happened?

16:57.667 --> 16:59.300
The teacher didn't see deb--

16:59.367 --> 17:03.934
I stood at the window
and watched you for four hours,

17:04.000 --> 17:07.367
in case you needed me.

17:07.433 --> 17:09.233
You didn't.

17:09.300 --> 17:10.266
No big deal.

17:10.333 --> 17:12.333
Any real mother would
do that for her kid.

17:14.734 --> 17:17.633
Mrs. Petrillo,
I have the results of your test.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.333
Thanks.

17:30.633 --> 17:31.867
Let's roll.

17:39.533 --> 17:43.233
(calm music playing)

17:44.734 --> 17:47.233
I'm really looking forward
to dance class today.

17:54.233 --> 17:55.400
I can see that.

17:55.467 --> 17:58.400
You're wearing your
heat-seeking stretch pants.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.500
You're not dressed for class.

18:03.567 --> 18:05.100
I'm not going.

18:05.166 --> 18:06.266
Why not?

18:06.333 --> 18:09.400
Why not? I'll tell you why not.

18:09.467 --> 18:11.867
Because I cannot flounce
around the dance floor

18:11.934 --> 18:15.133
like some cheap,
trashy slut in heat.

18:19.233 --> 18:21.033
Lord knows I've tried.

18:25.400 --> 18:26.166
Blanche, look--

18:26.233 --> 18:28.200
Rose, please,
I do not need a lecture.

18:28.266 --> 18:30.800
I'm a klutz. I accept that.

18:30.867 --> 18:32.367
It's no big thing.

18:32.433 --> 18:35.200
You're awkward
when it comes to your body.

18:39.567 --> 18:40.467
Say what?

18:42.033 --> 18:44.000
You have no coordination.

18:44.066 --> 18:47.834
Obviously the stories
about all your romantic escapades

18:47.900 --> 18:50.700
have been greatly exaggerated.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.767
Just what is that
supposed to mean?

18:52.834 --> 18:55.033
Blanche, if you can't
do a simple dance,

18:55.100 --> 18:56.800
how can I believe that story

18:56.867 --> 18:59.533
about you and the flying
Finnelli brothers?

19:04.066 --> 19:06.233
That was all true.

19:06.300 --> 19:10.233
To this day I get flushed
every time I pass a Jungle gym.

19:12.100 --> 19:16.333
That story's no truer
than the one you told about

19:16.400 --> 19:20.200
you and Buzz in the Lunar Module.

19:22.166 --> 19:24.133
Oh, that does it.

19:24.200 --> 19:28.967
Rose, I would never lie
about the U.S. space program.

19:30.367 --> 19:34.000
Awkward when it comes to my body,
no coordination?

19:34.066 --> 19:36.767
You want to see a body
defy the laws of nature,

19:36.834 --> 19:38.734
physics, and Dade county?

19:41.200 --> 19:44.166
You just hit that music, girl,
and follow my lead.

19:46.567 --> 19:48.600
Look into my eyes.

19:48.667 --> 19:50.367
(mambo music plays)

20:26.400 --> 20:27.900
Hi, girls.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.700
This is not
what it looks like.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.567
That's their business,

20:34.633 --> 20:39.066
but if I see your hand
on Rose's behind, it'll kill me.

20:39.133 --> 20:40.600
Ciao, everybody.

20:40.667 --> 20:42.100
We got to catch a boat.

20:42.166 --> 20:44.400
Oh, Ma, they're leaving.

20:44.467 --> 20:48.400
We're taking our daughter
Gina back home to marry Guido.

20:48.467 --> 20:50.400
Your daughter Gina?
What about Dorothy?

20:50.467 --> 20:52.867
What about the blood tests?

20:52.934 --> 20:55.266
We didn't wait for results.

20:55.333 --> 20:59.100
I don't need a test
to say who my mother is.

20:59.166 --> 21:02.033
A mother's someone
who raises you,

21:02.100 --> 21:06.233
loves you, and is always there.
I don't need more proof.

21:06.300 --> 21:07.600
Me, neither.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.867
I raised her, and I was the one

21:09.934 --> 21:12.066
who got her through
that awkward period.

21:12.133 --> 21:15.033
The 50 toughest years of my life.

21:20.700 --> 21:24.133
That's the way we feel
about our Gina.

21:24.200 --> 21:28.367
It's not that it wouldn't be nice
having you as a daughter,

21:28.433 --> 21:30.200
but we love Gina.

21:30.266 --> 21:31.533
So does Guido.

21:31.600 --> 21:35.066
He wrote he could never
love anyone but Gina.

21:35.133 --> 21:37.934
He wants us to return her.

21:38.000 --> 21:43.433
Dorothea, I am so sorry
we put you through all this.

21:43.500 --> 21:46.333
You would have made
a wonderful daughter,

21:46.400 --> 21:50.500
but then you already
have for your mother.

21:50.567 --> 21:53.033
Sophia.

21:53.100 --> 21:54.600
<i>Arrivederci.</i>

21:54.667 --> 21:56.700
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

21:56.767 --> 21:58.266
Ciao.

21:58.333 --> 22:00.533
Oh, what sweet people.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.367
I hope everything works for Gina.

22:03.433 --> 22:04.233
Why shouldn't it?

22:04.300 --> 22:07.233
She's got a man back home
who owns a goat.

22:07.734 --> 22:11.166
In Sicily that makes you a yuppie.

22:12.700 --> 22:15.500
That dancing has done wonders.

22:15.567 --> 22:17.667
I feel so energized.
I feel so alive.

22:17.734 --> 22:22.233
I feel like working this body
into a manic frenzy.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.967
We have time to get to class.

22:25.033 --> 22:27.200
The circus is in town.

22:27.266 --> 22:29.433
Let's go look up
the flying Finnelli brothers.

22:37.767 --> 22:41.166
-How about a cup of tea, Ma?
-Good idea, pussycat.

22:43.066 --> 22:45.533
Ma, you never thought I wasn't
your daughter, did you?

22:45.600 --> 22:47.133
Of course, not.

22:47.633 --> 22:49.967
Because if you want
to check the results--

22:50.033 --> 22:52.800
Don't talk crazy. I'll be in.

22:55.934 --> 22:57.967
-What's that?
-Nothing.

22:59.266 --> 23:02.200
When you said
you forgot your keys,

23:02.266 --> 23:04.266
you got the test results.

23:04.333 --> 23:05.467
What if I did?

23:07.834 --> 23:10.333
Let me see
the lab results, Ma.

23:10.400 --> 23:12.200
Mrs. Petrillo to you.

23:15.934 --> 23:17.633
Then I'm not your daughter.

23:18.734 --> 23:21.166
Gotcha, Dorothy!
It was just a shopping list.

23:24.400 --> 23:28.667
You have absolutely
no sense of humor,

23:28.734 --> 23:30.767
just like your uncle Vito,

23:30.834 --> 23:33.433
at least I think
he was your uncle Vito.

23:34.433 --> 23:36.100
Kidding! Just kidding.

23:43.667 --> 23:47.166
(theme music playing)
