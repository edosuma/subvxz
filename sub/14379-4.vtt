begins morning rituals.

01:14.216 --> 01:15.316
Hmm. No paper?

01:15.350 --> 01:19.183
Guess I don't need the
paper
to tell me the weather.

01:19.216 --> 01:21.166
Weather!

01:22.200 --> 01:23.416
Ha ha ha!

01:23.450 --> 01:25.100
Wow! Honey!

01:25.133 --> 01:27.266
Yes, dear.
Coffee's coming.

01:27.300 --> 01:29.466
Huh? Where is
everything?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.266
You won't believe
the weather.

01:32.300 --> 01:33.200
Wha--uh...

01:33.233 --> 01:34.350
Have you seen
the coffeepot?

01:34.383 --> 01:37.033
You mean the one
right behind you?
Huh?

01:37.066 --> 01:38.383
Now, look,

Hi, honey!

01:47.033 --> 01:48.050
Whew!

01:48.083 --> 01:49.216
I almost blew it.

01:49.250 --> 01:51.066
If mom and dad
catch on,

01:51.100 --> 01:52.383
my experiment
will be ruined,

01:52.416 --> 01:55.433
not to mention
finding out
about my lab.

01:55.466 --> 01:57.416
As long as I can
keep them oblivious,

01:57.450 --> 02:01.233
I should be able
to continue to study
their adult behavior.

02:01.266 --> 02:04.016
If only I had shrunken
all this stuff

02:17.366 --> 02:19.483
[Whispers]
Careful.

02:20.266 --> 02:21.450
Ha ha ha! Honey...

02:21.483 --> 02:25.283
Your paper's right
where it always is.

02:25.316 --> 02:28.316
But where's
my doormat? Hmm...

02:28.350 --> 02:30.350
Oh, no! I forgot!

02:30.383 --> 02:33.416
And I haven't
shrunken it yet.

02:35.433 --> 02:37.266
Uh...uh...

02:37.300 --> 02:39.116
Oh, there it is!

02:39.150 --> 02:40.233
Hi, Dee Dee.

02:40.266 --> 02:42.233
Bye, Dee Dee.

02:48.450 --> 02:51.100
Ooh!

02:51.133 --> 02:52.466
Not now, Dee Dee.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.200
I am...

02:54.233 --> 02:56.250
Very busy.

02:56.283 --> 02:58.083
Hmm.

02:58.116 --> 02:59.333
I want to play, too.

02:59.366 --> 03:01.000
I am not playing!

03:01.033 --> 03:03.250
This is
very important...

03:03.283 --> 03:04.450
Ha ha ha!

03:04.483 --> 03:06.033
Yes, Dee Dee.

03:06.066 --> 03:07.283
While you play
with the dolls,

03:07.316 --> 03:09.200
I can fix up
the Dollhouse.

03:09.233 --> 03:11.183
Now, here are
the rules.

03:11.216 --> 03:12.100

03:17.466 --> 03:19.000
And, Dee Dee?

03:19.033 --> 03:20.083
Uh-huh?

03:20.116 --> 03:23.200
You must not interact
with the test subjects.

03:23.233 --> 03:24.300
Test subjects?

03:24.333 --> 03:28.483
Mom and dad must not know
about our little game.

03:29.016 --> 03:29.483
Game?

03:30.016 --> 03:33.250
I will be right here
behind you.

03:35.250 --> 03:36.483
Dee Dee: Let's see.

03:37.016 --> 03:38.483
Mom is cleaning...

03:39.016 --> 03:40.383
And cleaning.

03:40.416 --> 03:43.133
And dad is reading...

03:43.166 --> 03:45.050
And reading.

03:45.083 --> 03:47.216
Suddenly, dad gets up,

03:47.250 --> 03:50.483
led by mysterious forces.

03:51.016 --> 03:52.450
And he is not alone.

03:52.483 --> 03:57.350
As they move across the room,
their eyes lock.

03:57.383 --> 04:01.116
Dad moves in
for the kiss.

04:01.150 --> 04:03.266
What do you think
you're doing?

04:03.300 --> 04:05.483
I...don't...know?

04:06.016 --> 04:07.166

04:08.300 --> 04:10.350
Do something!

04:12.483 --> 04:15.116
Hyah!

04:15.150 --> 04:16.383
Yowch!

04:16.416 --> 04:18.333
What are you
doing?!

04:18.366 --> 04:19.316
I think it's gone.

04:19.350 --> 04:20.333
Ok. Good-bye now.

04:20.366 --> 04:23.000
I will no longer be
needing your help.

Well...

04:47.300 --> 04:49.116
Ha ha! We better
get going.

04:49.150 --> 04:51.250
Don't want
to be late
for school.

04:51.283 --> 04:54.133
Ha ha ha!
Right, Dee Dee?

04:54.433 --> 04:56.250
Not so fast.

04:56.283 --> 04:59.366
Aren't you forgetting
something?

04:59.483 --> 05:03.083
Both: Our good-bye kisses.

Ohh!

05:07.250 --> 05:08.250
This is fun!

05:08.283 --> 05:11.066
Fun?! If mom and dad
find out about--

What's that sound?

05:13.450 --> 05:14.450

05:14.483 --> 05:16.283
Have a good day
at work!

Work?! He will see
everything!

05:19.083 --> 05:22.483
I've got to get him
back in the house.

05:23.350 --> 05:28.016
Oh, I'm running late.
I'd better take the expressway.

05:36.216 --> 05:38.366
Where the heck am I?

05:38.400 --> 05:40.150
"Dexter's lab"?

05:40.183 --> 05:44.366
Must be one of those
modern neighborhoods.

05:48.333 --> 05:49.400
Ok. Now I'm lost.

05:49.433 --> 05:53.250
I'll just stop and ask this guy
for directions.

Oh! Huh?

06:08.466 --> 06:10.433
I'm home.

06:10.466 --> 06:12.000
That does it.

too rascally.

06:15.433 --> 06:17.233
I must abort
my experiment.

06:17.266 --> 06:19.216
As soon as they are asleep,

06:19.250 --> 06:21.133
I will begin
the enlargement.

06:21.166 --> 06:23.000
Hi, honey. I'm home.

06:23.033 --> 06:25.283
I had
the strangest day.

06:25.316 --> 06:26.333
You don't say.

06:26.366 --> 06:29.450
So, what's
for dinner?
I'm starved.

06:29.483 --> 06:32.016
Sleep?

06:32.133 --> 06:36.033
I had the most peculiar
feeling all day,

06:36.066 --> 06:38.316
like we were being watched.

06:38.350 --> 06:40.100

for kissy-face.

How long are they
going to--

[mom and dad snoring]

07:04.066 --> 07:06.066
Ok. Enough observing
for today.

07:06.100 --> 07:09.283

and the house

07:09.316 --> 07:11.116
back to normal.

Where did you get
that thing on your head?

Isn't that the question
of the day?

Dude, I got mine
from a little girl
down the street

How dare you sell
my invention?

But, Dexter, it's
all the rage right now.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.250
Everybody wants one.

09:11.283 --> 09:13.450
And besides,
aren't they cool?

09:13.483 --> 09:15.066
But how did you--

09:15.100 --> 09:20.283
you see, after you left
your lab, I snuck in.

09:23.250 --> 09:26.016
I saw your invention
and said...

09:26.050 --> 09:27.333
Wow! What a neat hat!

09:27.366 --> 09:31.366
Dee Dee, voice-over:
I went outside to play,
and before you know it...

09:31.400 --> 09:34.100
Hey! Where'd you get
the cool hat?

09:34.133 --> 09:36.250
Yeah. Like,
I want one, too.

Yeah! Me, too!

09:37.450 --> 09:40.416
[People all talking at once]

Dee Dee, voice-over:
So, I ran back to your lab

09:44.183 --> 09:48.116
and put the hat
in your duplicating machine...

09:52.083 --> 09:53.316
And made a whole bunch
of them

09:53.350 --> 09:55.000
so that everyone
could have one.

09:55.033 --> 09:57.300
Now I can barely keep up
with the demand.

09:57.333 --> 10:00.000
Um, that is
very nice, Dee Dee,

10:00.033 --> 10:01.000
except...

10:01.033 --> 10:02.333
It's not meant
to be a hat!

10:02.366 --> 10:06.133
Look, Dexter
here's all the money
we've made so far

10:06.166 --> 10:08.450
from selling the hats.

10:10.066 --> 10:11.050
Look, everyone!

It's Dexter--
the designer of the hat.

right there.

Mr. Dexter,

11:29.000 --> 11:32.150
our firm is prepared
to offer you
7.5 billion,

11:32.183 --> 11:33.350
thus increasing
our share

11:33.383 --> 11:34.416
to principal
stockholder.

11:34.450 --> 11:38.100
All you have
to do is sign
this contract,

11:38.133 --> 11:39.133
and the deal
will be final.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.483
Well, I suppose
it's a reasonable offer.

She says
it's important.

11:49.350 --> 11:51.333
Oh, all righty.
Send her in.

11:51.366 --> 11:54.066
I'm sorry, gentlemen. I--

11:56.083 --> 11:58.083

we need to talk!

11:58.116 --> 12:00.216
There's
something wrong
with the hats!

See
for yourself!

12:02.483 --> 12:04.016
This just in.

12:04.050 --> 12:05.333
Millions of angry consumers

12:05.366 --> 12:07.033
who recently purchased
this hat

12:07.066 --> 12:10.433
are now demanding
their money back
from major retailers,

12:10.466 --> 12:11.466
claiming that wearing it

12:12.000 --> 12:14.033
caused them to develop
very large heads.

12:14.066 --> 12:17.083
At first, I thought
it was my imagination.

I can't leave
my house...

a plane to catch,
Mr. Mad hatter.

Oh, that's it.
I'm finished.

12:34.366 --> 12:37.416
It's all my fault.
I should have
seen this coming.

12:37.450 --> 12:40.100
You mean, you knew
this would happen?

12:40.133 --> 12:41.250
Well, not exactly.

12:41.283 --> 12:45.066
I wanted to invent a device
to help me study molecules

12:45.100 --> 12:48.083
without the use of expensive
and cumbersome microscopes.

12:48.116 --> 12:52.366
So I set out to design
the molecular magnetron,

12:52.400 --> 12:54.216
and, alas, it worked!

12:54.250 --> 12:56.016
Now I could study molecules

could not resist.

is duplicate

all you have to do

Dee Dee, may I recommend

15:53.100 --> 15:55.366
that you lower
your center of gravity

15:55.400 --> 15:57.050
by dropping your arms?

15:57.083 --> 16:00.150
That should soften
your landings.
