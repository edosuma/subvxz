00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:06.583 --> 00:07.709
(beeping)

00:07.750 --> 00:09.166
(beeping stops)

00:09.208 --> 00:10.500
(exhales) MORNING.

00:10.542 --> 00:13.500
IT'S DAY 182
OF PROJECT COOPLETS.

00:13.542 --> 00:17.375
WE'RE AT 26 WEEKS. MULTIPLES ARE
USUALLY BORN AROUND 32.

00:17.417 --> 00:22.625
SO I'M SAVORING EVERY
LAST MINUTE OF THIS PREGNANCY.

00:22.667 --> 00:26.333
I MEAN, JUST LOOK
AT MY GORGEOUS WIFE.

00:26.375 --> 00:28.041
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

00:28.083 --> 00:30.375
HOW DID I GET SO LUCKY?

00:30.417 --> 00:32.041
I SWEAR, I HAVE NO IDEA.

00:32.083 --> 00:36.417
ALL I KNOW IS THAT THIS IS WHAT
I'VE WANTED MY ENTIRE LIFE--

00:36.458 --> 00:41.250
TO TAKE CARE OF MY PREGNANT WIFE
AND A HOUSE FULL OF KIDS.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.458
(kisses)
(snorts)

00:42.500 --> 00:43.875
OH.

00:43.917 --> 00:45.041
(grunts)

00:45.083 --> 00:46.417
(snorts)

00:46.458 --> 00:48.583
(mouth full) YOU KNOW,
I'M REALLY NOT MUCH

00:48.625 --> 00:51.041
OF A MORNING PERSON,
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO NOW,

00:51.083 --> 00:52.667
IT'S REALLY ALL ABOUT
MULTITASKING.

00:52.709 --> 00:56.083
THE BABIES ARE THE SIZE
OF LETTUCE THIS WEEK.

00:56.125 --> 00:58.041
YOU KNOW,
THERE IS AN APP FOR THAT.

00:58.083 --> 00:59.667
BRAIN DEVELOPMENT HAS KICKED
INTO HIGH GEAR,

00:59.709 --> 01:02.208
SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT CHARLOTTE
GET ALL THE RIGHT NUTRITION.

01:02.250 --> 01:04.083
AND YEAH, SOMETIMES
WHEN I GIVE HER HER VITAMINS,

01:04.125 --> 01:06.834
SHE THROWS THEM AT ME,
BUT I DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

01:06.875 --> 01:08.417
THIS IS WHAT I CAN DO
TO CONTRIBUTE

01:08.458 --> 01:11.583
WHILE SHE IS DOING ALL
THE HEAVY LIFTING, LITERALLY.

01:11.625 --> 01:13.208
(sets bottle down)

01:13.250 --> 01:14.583
(makes whooshing sound)

01:14.625 --> 01:16.667
YES!

01:16.709 --> 01:18.583
BREAKFAST IS CHARLOTTE'S
LEAST FAVORITE MEAL,

01:18.625 --> 01:21.667
SO I LIKE TO GIVE HER
PLENTY OF OPTIONS.

01:21.709 --> 01:22.500
THANKS FOR MAKING
ME PANCAKES, DAD.

01:22.542 --> 01:26.458
YOU GOT IT, MASE.

01:26.500 --> 01:29.208
RISE AND SHINE, BEAUTIFUL.

01:29.250 --> 01:30.959
TIME TO GET UP.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.667
(groans) ENOUGH
WITH THE DAMN BREAKFAST BUFFET.

01:34.709 --> 01:35.709
(groans)

01:37.375 --> 01:38.917
IT'S TOO EARLY.

01:38.959 --> 01:40.083
I LET YOU SLEEP
AS LONG AS I COULD.

01:40.125 --> 01:41.750
(utensils clatter)
NO, COOP.

01:41.792 --> 01:44.208
MY WATER JUST BROKE.
THE BABIES ARE COMING.

01:44.250 --> 01:53.667
(panting)

01:53.709 --> 01:57.041
(pencil scratches paper)

01:57.083 --> 01:58.667
YOU KNOCKED ME UP.

01:58.709 --> 02:01.041
MY GUYS PREVAILED.

02:01.083 --> 02:05.041
SWEETIE, WE'RE HAVING A BABY,
YOU AND ME?

02:05.083 --> 02:06.709
WE'RE HAVING A BABY.

02:06.750 --> 02:08.709
NO, COOPER. (chuckles)

02:08.750 --> 02:11.750
WE'RE HAVING THREE BABIES.

02:11.792 --> 02:13.583
(sighs)

02:13.625 --> 02:15.667
THREE? THREE BABIES.

02:15.709 --> 02:17.041
THAT... (laughs)

02:17.083 --> 02:19.667
IS AMAZING. I'M--WOW. OKAY.

02:19.709 --> 02:21.041
I CAN'T REACT.
SHE--SHE DOESN'T WANT ONE.

02:21.083 --> 02:22.917
SHE'S DEFINITELY
NOT GONNA WANT THREE.

02:22.959 --> 02:27.041
BUT I'M TOTALLY EXCITED.
YOU GET THAT, RIGHT?

02:27.083 --> 02:28.583
WOW.

02:28.625 --> 02:29.959
(chuckles)
THAT'S ONE WORD FOR IT.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.041
I CAN THINK OF A FEW OTHERS,
ALL FOUR LETTERS.

02:34.083 --> 02:35.542
ARE YOU OKAY?

02:35.583 --> 02:37.500
NO. YOU HEARD ME, RIGHT?

02:37.542 --> 02:39.041
THREE BABIES.

02:39.083 --> 02:40.709
I KNOW WHEN THE NIGHT
OF CONCEPTION WAS.

02:40.750 --> 02:42.750
WE WERE IN THE SHOWER,
AND SHE DID THIS THING...
NO, I'M NOT ALL RIGHT.

02:42.792 --> 02:44.500
AND THEN I DID
THIS OTHER THING...
THIS THING'S SUPPOSED TO BE
99.9% EFFECTIVE.

02:44.542 --> 02:46.291
AND I MADE SOUNDS
COME OUT OF HER...
LUCKY ME. I'M THE 1%.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.291
THAT YOU DO NOT HEAR
IN NATURE.
UGH! YOU KNOW HOW BIG
I'M GONNA GET...

02:48.333 --> 02:49.709
I WAS THE MAN.

02:49.750 --> 02:51.959
HOW HARD IT'S GONNA BE TO TAKE
CARE OF THREE RUG RATS?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.208
OKAY. I KNOW IT'S A LOT
TO TAKE IN.

02:54.250 --> 02:56.917
IS IT OKAY THAT
I'M A LITTLE BIT EXCITED?

02:56.959 --> 02:58.500
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T EXPECT
ME TO BE.

02:58.542 --> 03:00.333
UGH.

03:00.375 --> 03:02.542
(sighs)

03:02.583 --> 03:04.834
(pencil scratches paper)

03:04.875 --> 03:06.625
OKAY.
THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME.

03:06.667 --> 03:08.083
YOU'VE SEEN
PLENTY OF ULTRASOUNDS.

03:08.125 --> 03:09.750
NOT WHEN THEY'RE OUR KIDS

03:09.792 --> 03:11.166
AND NOT WHEN
THEY'RE THE SIZE OF PLUMS.

03:11.208 --> 03:13.792
OH, COME ON, CHARLOTTE.
YOU KNOW YOU'RE EXCITED.

03:13.834 --> 03:15.667
ALL ULTRASOUNDS LOOK THE SAME.

03:15.709 --> 03:18.041
THEY'RE LIKE THE SKETCHES
OF "AMERICA'S MOST WANTED."

03:18.083 --> 03:20.041
YOU CAN'T IDENTIFY SOMEONE
FROM THOSE.

03:20.083 --> 03:22.041
ALL RIGHT.
THERE THEY ARE.

03:22.083 --> 03:24.000
THERE'S BABY ONE,

03:24.041 --> 03:25.583
BABY TWO...

03:25.625 --> 03:27.959
OH, YOU SEE IT, RIGHT?
THOSE ARE CLEARLY OUR KIDS.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.667
SHE HAS NO IDEA
WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT.

03:29.709 --> 03:30.834
(high-pitched voice) HI, KIDS.

03:30.875 --> 03:32.583
(chuckles)
(normal voice) I MADE YOU.

03:32.625 --> 03:33.792
THIS MEANS I CAN'T GO
TO THE UROLOGY CONFERENCE

03:33.834 --> 03:35.375
IN SPAIN IN OCTOBER.

03:35.417 --> 03:37.792
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO GO
TO HAWAII FOR CHRISTMAS.

03:37.834 --> 03:39.041
OH, COME ON, CHARLOTTE.
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

03:39.083 --> 03:40.709
YOU'RE NOT TERMINALLY ILL.

03:40.750 --> 03:42.375
I'M GONNA BE A DOUBLE-WIDE
WITH FEET.

03:42.417 --> 03:44.041
MORE OF YOU TO LOVE.

03:44.083 --> 03:46.166
LOOK, ALL THREE LOOK GREAT.

03:46.208 --> 03:48.709
YOU SAID WITH TRIPLETS,
ONE OF 'EM MIGHT NOT MAKE IT.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.417
NO, WHAT I SAID WAS THAT
WITH MULTIPLES,

03:50.458 --> 03:53.041
THERE'S A 53% CHANCE
OF SPONTANEOUS REDUCTION,

03:53.083 --> 03:55.709
BUT SINCE THAT USUALLY HAPPENS
IN THE FIRST TRIMESTER,

03:55.750 --> 03:57.458
YOU ARE ALMOST IN THE CLEAR.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.250
YAY FOR ME.

03:59.291 --> 04:01.500
LOOK, THERE ARE INHERENT RISKS
WITH CARRYING TRIPLETS TO TERM.

04:01.542 --> 04:04.041
WE SHOULD GO BACK TO MY OFFICE
AND TALK ABOUT IT.

04:04.083 --> 04:05.291
I HAVE TO GET BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL.

04:05.333 --> 04:07.625
NO, WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
IS HIRE A NEW E.R. DOC

04:07.667 --> 04:10.208
AND FOCUS ON THE PLUMS.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.625
(sighs)

04:14.792 --> 04:17.750
(pencil scratches paper)

04:17.792 --> 04:19.542
(indistinct conversations)

04:19.583 --> 04:21.542
SORRY.
(clears throat)

04:21.583 --> 04:24.083
I'D, UH, JUST AS SOON
KEEP THIS TO MYSELF,

04:24.125 --> 04:26.125
BUT SINCE
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE,

04:26.166 --> 04:27.959
I'M, UH,

04:28.000 --> 04:29.375
I'M PREGNANT...

04:30.709 --> 04:31.709
WITH TRIPLETS.

04:31.750 --> 04:32.792
WOW.
THAT'S SO WONDERFUL.

04:32.834 --> 04:34.125
CONGRATULATIONS!
THAT'S SO GREAT. YEAH.

04:34.166 --> 04:36.542
OKAY, WHO ALREADY KNEW?

04:36.583 --> 04:38.125
TIME-OUT. IF THERE'S
A TIME AND A PLACE TO LIE,

04:38.166 --> 04:39.625
IT'S RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW.

04:39.667 --> 04:42.000
AND DON'T YOU DARE LIE
TO A PREGNANT WOMAN.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.000
LET'S GO, PEOPLE.
SHOW OF HANDS.

04:47.709 --> 04:50.583
OW!
IS IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU
TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT?

04:50.625 --> 04:52.917
YOU TOLD ADDISON.
SHE'S MY DOCTOR.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.041
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE
FOR TELLING VIOLET?
DOESN'T COUNT.

04:55.083 --> 04:56.875
THANKS, COOP.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

04:56.917 --> 04:59.041
I'M SORRY. I TOLD JAKE.
(mouth full) BUT ONLY
SO SHE COULD PICK MY BRAIN

04:59.083 --> 05:00.667
ABOUT PREGNANCY WITH MULTIPLES.

05:00.709 --> 05:02.792
(Amelia) I SAW COOPER TROLLING
THE INTERNET FOR BABY NAMES.

05:02.834 --> 05:04.375
AND NOT THAT YOU ASKED,

05:04.417 --> 05:07.041
BUT YOUR KID WILL BE PANTSED
EVERY DAY IF YOU NAME HIM OTIS.

05:07.083 --> 05:08.125
AND COOP WAS ASKING ME

05:08.166 --> 05:10.083
WHEN NAOMI STARTED WEARING
MATERNITY CLOTHES.

05:10.125 --> 05:12.000
MM.
YOU THINK I LOOK FAT?

05:12.041 --> 05:14.041
NO, YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

05:14.083 --> 05:16.083
BEAUTIFUL AND FAT,

05:16.125 --> 05:17.583
BUT BEAUTIFUL.

05:17.625 --> 05:19.458
I MAY BE THE LAST ONE TO KNOW,

05:19.500 --> 05:21.792
BUT THIS IS FANTASTIC NEWS.

05:21.834 --> 05:25.083
SERIOUSLY. NEW LIFE.
YOU--YOU MUST BE SO EXCITED.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.750
I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE ODDS
THAT MY BODY MIGHT ABSORB

05:27.792 --> 05:29.917
AT LEAST ONE OF THESE
FREELOADERS BEFORE BIRTH.
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

05:29.959 --> 05:31.709
THAT'S TERRIBLE.
THAT'S DARWIN.

05:31.750 --> 05:32.959
SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.125
YOU GONNA FIND OUT THE SEX?

05:34.166 --> 05:35.625
WELL, THE ULTRASOUND
WON'T BE DEFINITIVE

05:35.667 --> 05:37.041
UNTIL CLOSER TO 18 WEEKS.

05:37.083 --> 05:38.625
IF THIS TECHNICALLY WASN'T
A HIGH-RISK PREGNANCY,

05:38.667 --> 05:40.083
I WOULDN'T WANT TO SEE
ANOTHER ULTRASOUND.

05:40.125 --> 05:42.208
I MEAN, I WANT THE MYSTERY OF
THAT. I WANT THE ANTICIPATION.

05:42.250 --> 05:44.542
I WANT TO KNOW
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

05:44.583 --> 05:47.125
BUT I MEAN, IT WOULD BE AWESOME
IF IT WAS A SURPRISE, RIGHT?

05:47.166 --> 05:49.041
I AM PREGNANT WITH TRIPLETS.

05:49.083 --> 05:51.125
THAT'S SURPRISE ENOUGH
FOR A LIFETIME.

05:53.792 --> 05:55.083
SO WE'RE HAVING TRIPLETS.

05:55.125 --> 05:57.667
(laughter)
GREAT.
CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

05:57.709 --> 06:01.041
I THREW OUT ALMOST EVERYTHING
OR DONATED IT TO CHARITY.

06:01.083 --> 06:04.542
BUT I STILL HAVE
PETE'S TOOTHBRUSH.

06:04.583 --> 06:07.041
I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT BABIES...
I HAVEN'T TOUCHED IT.

06:07.083 --> 06:10.125
BUT BABIES ARE LIFE, AND VIOLET
WANTS TO TALK ABOUT DEATH.
THE BRISTLES ARE ALL WORN DOWN
AND THERE'S EVEN

06:10.166 --> 06:12.750
THAT LITTLE STAIN OF DRIED
TOOTHPASTE UNDERNEATH IT.
I NEED TO FOCUS.
I NEED TO FOCUS ON DEATH.

06:12.792 --> 06:14.375
AND I JUST STARE AT IT
EVERY MORNING...

06:14.417 --> 06:15.834
IT SOUNDS WRONG, DOESN'T IT?
IN THE BATHROOM.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.375
I DON'T KNOW.

06:17.417 --> 06:19.583
I MEAN, I KNOW HE'S NOT ACTUALLY
GONNA COME BACK TO USE IT,

06:19.625 --> 06:22.834
BUT IT JUST MAKES ME
FEEL BETTER TO SEE IT THERE,

06:22.875 --> 06:24.625
NEXT TO MINE ON A SINK.

06:24.667 --> 06:25.583
WHATEVER WORKS, RIGHT?

06:25.625 --> 06:27.041
THAT'S RIGHT.

06:27.083 --> 06:28.625
DON'T YOU THINK--

06:28.667 --> 06:30.458
I MEAN, SHOULDN'T YOU BE
TALKING TO SOMEONE?

06:30.500 --> 06:31.709
I'M TALKING TO YOU.

06:31.750 --> 06:32.667
COME--

06:32.709 --> 06:35.041
I MEAN--I MEAN,
I HAVE GRIEF GROUP,

06:35.083 --> 06:37.458
WHICH SORT OF HELPS.

06:37.500 --> 06:39.709
I GUESS. I DON'T KNOW.
LOOK, I MEAN,

06:39.750 --> 06:42.500
PETE IS DEAD, AND, UM...

06:44.834 --> 06:46.625
AND THAT SUCKS.

06:46.667 --> 06:49.000
IT'S GONNA SUCK
UNTIL IT DOESN'T.

06:49.041 --> 06:52.041
OH, I'M SO SORRY, VI.
OKAY.

06:52.083 --> 06:54.166
SHE'S MOURNING THE LOSS
OF HER HUSBAND,

06:54.208 --> 06:56.375
AND HE WAS MY FRIEND.

06:56.417 --> 06:59.917
I JUST CAN'T GO THERE RIGHT NOW.
I AM IN BABY LAND.

06:59.959 --> 07:01.875
I MEAN, I WANT TO BE DOING
CARTWHEELS, WHICH IS FUNNY,

07:01.917 --> 07:04.333
'CAUSE I'VE NEVER DONE
A CARTWHEEL IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

07:04.375 --> 07:07.417
I NEED TO STOP THIS.
OKAY, HER HUSBAND IS DEAD.

07:07.458 --> 07:09.500
I CANNOT SHOW HER MY BABY GLEE.

07:09.542 --> 07:13.542
I NEED TO SMILE AND NOD
AND PRETEND I'M LISTENING.

07:13.583 --> 07:14.917
(exhales deeply)

07:14.959 --> 07:16.500
OKAY.

07:16.542 --> 07:18.083
THANKS. THANKS, COOPER.

07:18.125 --> 07:20.917
FOR WHAT?
FOR LISTENING.

07:20.959 --> 07:22.458
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.500
I'M GONNA BE LATE
FOR MY GROUP.
OKAY.

07:25.667 --> 07:27.041
(door opens)

07:27.083 --> 07:28.667
(people speaking indistinctly)

07:28.709 --> 07:30.625
SHE THANKED ME FOR LISTENING.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.542
I WASN'T LISTENING.

07:32.583 --> 07:34.583
I'M A BAD FRIEND.
I MEAN, SHE NEEDS HELP.

07:34.625 --> 07:38.291
SHE IS SUFFERING,
AND I'M... JUST AN ASS.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.542
I MEAN, GO.
GO--GO BE WITH VIOLET.

07:40.583 --> 07:43.542
SERIOUSLY, I'M GOOD. GO.

07:43.583 --> 07:45.583
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

07:45.625 --> 07:47.041
VIOLET?

07:47.083 --> 07:48.125
YOU'RE NOT IN GRIEF GROUP.

07:48.166 --> 07:50.000
GABI, HI.

07:50.041 --> 07:51.667
UH, YEAH, I WAS
CHECKING ON A PATIENT.

07:51.709 --> 07:53.041
GUESS I LOST TRACK OF TIME.

07:53.083 --> 07:54.959
OH, ME, TOO.
I WAS VISITING ALLY.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.583
I DIDN'T KNOW
SHE WAS AT ST. AMBROSE.

07:56.625 --> 08:00.667
YEAH. THIS IS LIKE MY SECOND
HOME. I'M HERE EVERY DAY.

08:00.709 --> 08:02.458
YOU KNOW, I READ TO HER,
PLAY MUSIC.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.000
YOU KNOW, JUST LET HER KNOW
I LOVE HER.

08:04.041 --> 08:05.709
THAT'S REALLY NICE.

08:07.834 --> 08:10.542
WELL, IF WE GO NOW,
WE WON'T BE TOO LATE.

08:10.583 --> 08:13.125
IS IT AWFUL
THAT I WANNA PLAY HOOKY?

08:13.166 --> 08:15.291
OH, GOD. (laughs) NO.

08:15.333 --> 08:17.500
IT'S HARD, THE WORK
THAT WE DO OVER THERE.

08:17.542 --> 08:20.333
YEAH, IT'S ALSO HARD TO HEAR
OVER KASEY'S SOBBING.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.625
(laughs)

08:21.667 --> 08:23.583
THAT'S TERRIBLE.
I'M SORRY.

08:23.625 --> 08:25.917
NO, JUST THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF
TISSUES THAT SHE USES, YOU KNOW,

08:25.959 --> 08:28.208
LIKE A WHOLE BOX, REALLY?

08:28.250 --> 08:29.500
WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF US?

08:29.542 --> 08:30.750
YEAH,
BUT IT'S ALSO THAT THERE'S

08:30.792 --> 08:31.959
A KIND OF PECKING ORDER,
YOU KNOW?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.583
I MEAN, I KNOW I'M ENTITLED
TO MISS MY GIRLFRIEND,

08:34.625 --> 08:38.792
BUT HER SON WAS LIKE,
WHAT, 26 WHEN HE DIED?

08:38.834 --> 08:40.291
HOW DO YOU COMPETE
WITH THAT?

08:40.333 --> 08:41.583
YOU PLAY HOOKY.

08:41.625 --> 08:44.792
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

08:44.834 --> 08:46.583
DO YOU WANT COMPANY?

08:46.625 --> 08:48.000
OKAY, EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD.

08:48.041 --> 08:49.875
THE FIRST TRIMESTER TESTS
CAME BACK

08:49.917 --> 08:52.667
NEGATIVE FOR TRISOMY 13 AND 18,

08:52.709 --> 08:54.166
WHICH MEANS IT'S UNLIKELY
THAT THE KIDS

08:54.208 --> 08:56.041
WILL HAVE
ANY CHROMOSOMAL ABNORMALITIES.

08:56.083 --> 08:58.333
WE CAN GO AHEAD AND DO AN AMNIO
AT 16 WEEKS TO BE SURE.

08:58.375 --> 09:00.834
SOUNDS GREAT.

09:00.875 --> 09:02.041
RIGHT, CHAR?

09:02.083 --> 09:03.375
FANTASTIC. ARE WE DONE?

09:03.417 --> 09:05.375
NO. NO. WE HAVE TO DISCUSS
YOUR OPTIONS.

09:05.417 --> 09:07.166
NO, I KNOW MY OPTIONS.

09:07.208 --> 09:09.542
I'D LIKE TO HEAR THE OPTIONS.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.667
WITH MULTIPLES,
THERE'S A VERY HIGH PROBABILITY

09:11.709 --> 09:15.792
OF PRETERM DELIVERY, RESULTING
IN LOW BIRTHWEIGHT INFANTS,

09:15.834 --> 09:17.917
WHICH ARE AT RISK.
I KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE AT RISK FOR.

09:17.959 --> 09:19.792
A DEAD MOTHER.
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE AT RISK FOR,

09:19.834 --> 09:22.458
BECAUSE I JUST MAY KILL HER
RIGHT NOW.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.083
THE PROBLEM IS,
SHE'S CARRYING MY BABIES,

09:24.125 --> 09:25.417
SO I GUESS I SHOULD WAIT.

09:25.458 --> 09:27.583
IDEALLY,
WE WANT TO GET 32 WEEKS.

09:27.625 --> 09:29.208
THAT GIVES THE BABIES
THE BEST CHANCE.

09:29.250 --> 09:30.583
ANYTHING BEFORE 26 WEEKS,

09:30.625 --> 09:32.041
AND YOU'RE LOOKING
AT THE POSSIBILITY

09:32.083 --> 09:34.208
OF COGNITIVE
AND NEUROLOGICAL IMPAIRMENTS.

09:34.250 --> 09:35.500
GREAT. GOT IT.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.041
YOU DID YOUR JOB.

09:42.333 --> 09:45.375
SHE HAS TO UNDERSTAND THE RISKS.
CAN--CAN YOU TALK TO HER?

09:45.417 --> 09:47.500
TELL ME
WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW.

09:55.291 --> 09:58.625
(exhales deeply)

09:58.667 --> 10:00.542
(exhales)

10:02.083 --> 10:03.458
CAN'T SLEEP?

10:03.500 --> 10:06.041
AH, BLOODSUCKING TICKS ARE
GIVING ME HEARTBURN.

10:06.083 --> 10:09.125
CAN'T WAIT TILL
THEY KEEP ME UP KICKBOXING.

10:09.166 --> 10:10.709
ANYTHING I CAN DO?

10:10.750 --> 10:13.041
HMM. GO BACK IN TIME,

10:13.083 --> 10:15.875
WEAR A CONDOM.

10:15.917 --> 10:17.458
(chuckles)

10:17.500 --> 10:20.959
SO I WAS TALKING TO ADDISON
THIS AFTERNOON AFTER YOU LEFT.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.333
AND WITH TRIPLETS,
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A LOT

10:23.375 --> 10:25.583
OF POSSIBLE
OBSTETRIC COMPLICATIONS.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.792
REMEMBER WHEN YOU ASKED IF THERE
WAS ANYTHING YOU COULD DO?

10:28.834 --> 10:30.250
STOP TALKING.

10:30.291 --> 10:32.542
YOU'RE AT RISK
FOR PRETERM LABOR,

10:32.583 --> 10:34.041
PREMATURE RUPTURED MEMBRANES,

10:34.083 --> 10:36.041
GESTATIONAL DIABETES,
PREECLAMPSIA,

10:36.083 --> 10:38.500
AND POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGING,

10:38.542 --> 10:40.500
WHICH MEANS YOU COULD DIE,
CHARLOTTE.

10:40.542 --> 10:43.041
COOPER, I'M A DOCTOR.
I KNOW WHAT I'M AT RISK FOR.

10:43.083 --> 10:45.375
OH, MY GOD. I TAKE BACK
THE WHOLE KILLING HER THING.
I KNOW
THE POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS.

10:45.417 --> 10:47.125
OKAY?
QUIT BEING SO DRAMATIC.

10:47.166 --> 10:48.375
IS IT GONE?

10:48.417 --> 10:50.333
QUIT BEING SO DRAMATIC.

10:50.375 --> 10:53.583
I THINK WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT
SELECTIVE REDUCTION.

10:53.625 --> 10:55.750
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY
I DON'T NEED TO HEAR THIS?

10:55.792 --> 10:57.542
REDUCTION FROM TRIPLETS
TO TWINS,

10:57.583 --> 10:59.959
DECREASES THE RISK
OF SEVERE PREMATURITY

11:00.000 --> 11:02.917
AND THE RISK
OF LOSING THE WHOLE PREGNANCY

11:02.959 --> 11:04.750
FALLS FROM 15% TO 4%.

11:04.792 --> 11:06.083
I WON'T ABORT.

11:08.083 --> 11:11.709
YOU WERE HOPING THAT ONE OF THEM
WOULD BE ABSORBED ANYWAY.

11:11.750 --> 11:12.750
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

11:12.792 --> 11:14.709
ABSORBED IS
MY HIGHER POWER AT WORK.

11:14.750 --> 11:17.000
ABORTION IS
ME MAKING THE CALL.

11:17.041 --> 11:19.959
SELECTIVE REDUCTION
ISN'T EXACTLY ABORTION.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.625
IT'S A SHOT TO THE HEART
OF A FETUS

11:21.667 --> 11:23.208
WITH POTASSIUM CHLORIDE.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.041
YOU KNOW HOW YOU PICK?

11:25.083 --> 11:28.041
WHICHEVER ONE'S CLOSEST.
THAT'S WHO GETS THE NEEDLE.

11:28.083 --> 11:30.917
I'M NOT DOING THAT.

11:32.083 --> 11:34.250
I HAVE TO PEE.

11:34.291 --> 11:37.000
(grunts)

11:37.041 --> 11:38.583
(exhales)

11:42.875 --> 11:45.333
OKAY, THAT'S HORRIBLE,

11:45.375 --> 11:47.375
BUT IF LOSING ONE MEANS
YOU CAN SAVE TWO,

11:47.417 --> 11:52.041
IF LOSING ONE MEANS CHARLOTTE
WOULD BE OKAY? I DON'T KNOW.

11:52.083 --> 11:54.458
I DON'T KNOW. I'M THE DAD,
SO I SHOULD HAVE A SAY,

11:54.500 --> 11:58.834
BUT RIGHT NOW MOM'S DOING
ALL THE HARD WORK.

11:58.875 --> 12:03.458
IT'S CHARLOTTE'S BODY,
IT'S HER LIFE, IT'S HER CHOICE.

12:03.500 --> 12:07.709
(water running)
BUT I CAN'T LOSE HER AND I DON'T
WANT TO LOSE ANY OF MY BABIES.

12:07.750 --> 12:09.792
(water stops)

12:09.834 --> 12:12.500
SO WHAT THE HELL DO I DO?

12:12.542 --> 12:15.041
WHAT DO I DO?

12:15.083 --> 12:18.583
COOPER.

12:18.625 --> 12:21.709
WE TOLD MASON HE WAS
HAVING THREE SIBLINGS.

12:24.083 --> 12:26.709
THEN MASON'S HAVING
THREE SIBLINGS.

12:40.250 --> 12:42.250
(pencil scratches paper)

12:43.583 --> 12:46.667
WOW. THEY HAVE
A LOT OF STROLLERS HERE.

12:46.709 --> 12:49.125
MM-HMM.
YES. OH. HERE YOU GO.
LOOK AT THIS ONE.

12:49.166 --> 12:51.875
NO. BABY IN THE FRONT
WILL BE 3 MILES AWAY.

12:51.917 --> 12:53.458
I WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT.
SOMEONE COULD SNATCH IT

12:53.500 --> 12:55.208
AND I WOULDN'T KNOW TILL,
LIKE, AN HOUR LATER.

12:55.250 --> 12:57.542
(Mason) WELL, I-I CAN HELP.
SHE'S INSANE. RIGHT?
I MEAN, IT'S 3 FEET.

12:57.583 --> 13:00.041
UNLESS SHE'S LEGALLY BLIND,
SHE'LL BE ABLE TO SPOT DANGER.
I MEAN I COULD WALK,
LIKE, IN FRONT

13:00.083 --> 13:02.250
WITH ONE OF THE BABIES.
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A HELL
OF A BIG BROTHER.

13:02.291 --> 13:04.083
CAN I HELP YOU FOLKS?

13:04.125 --> 13:07.041
YES. WE ARE LOOKING
FOR STROLLERS, BUT, UM,

13:07.083 --> 13:08.917
THERE'S A LOT
TO CHOOSE FROM.

13:08.959 --> 13:11.500
WE HAVE SOME EXCELLENT MODELS,

13:11.542 --> 13:14.250
BUT THE TRUTH IS, IT'S REALLY
BEST TO CARRY THE BABY

13:14.291 --> 13:16.291
AND HOLD THEM CLOSE.
I DID THAT WITH MINE.

13:16.333 --> 13:18.458
YEAH, WELL, I'M PREGNANT
WITH TRIPLETS,

13:18.500 --> 13:21.125
SO HOW DO I HOLD ALL THREE
AT THE SAME TIME?

13:21.166 --> 13:24.250
DO YOU PUT ONE IN A BASKET
ON YOUR HEAD? OR--OR MAYBE

13:24.291 --> 13:26.041
WITH THREE IT DOESN'T REALLY
MATTER IF I DROP ONE

13:26.083 --> 13:28.166
NOW AND AGAIN,
'CAUSE I'VE GOT SPARES.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.041
OH, GOOD. SHE'S MAKING FRIENDS.
(Mason) YOU DON'T REALLY
MEAN THAT, RIGHT?

13:30.083 --> 13:32.041
I'LL BET THIS LADY WISHES
SHE CALLED IN SICK TODAY.
I CAN HELP WITH THE BABIES.

13:32.083 --> 13:34.291
I CAN CARRY ONE.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.

13:34.333 --> 13:36.166
UH, WE'LL LET YOU KNOW
IF WE NEED ANYTHING. THANKS.

13:36.208 --> 13:38.709
WITH MY LUCK, SHE'LL BE WAITING
FOR ME IN THE BREAST PUMP AISLE

13:38.750 --> 13:41.083
SO SHE CAN TELL ME HOW
SHE NURSED ALL OF HER KIDS

13:41.125 --> 13:42.083
UNTIL THEY'RE 27.

13:42.125 --> 13:45.375
EW! PEOPLE REALLY DO THAT?
NO.

13:45.417 --> 13:47.208
WHEN YOU'RE PREGNANT,
EVERYONE'S GOT AN OPINION,

13:47.250 --> 13:49.041
AND THEY ALL
WANNA OFFER ADVICE.

13:49.083 --> 13:51.041
OKAY, DOES SOMEONE NEED
A HUG? THREE...

13:51.083 --> 13:52.834
TWO...
ONE.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.166
(clears throat)

13:54.208 --> 13:55.208
WHO'S CRANKY?

13:55.250 --> 13:57.375
(sighs and sniffs)

13:57.417 --> 13:58.750
YOU CAN LET GO.
ALL RIGHT.

13:58.792 --> 14:01.291
YOU CAN STAY.
OKAY.

14:01.333 --> 14:03.625
(people speaking indistinctly)

14:03.667 --> 14:06.542
YOU DIDN'T TALK ABOUT LUCAS
IN GROUP TODAY. HOW'S HE DOING?

14:06.583 --> 14:09.291
HE DOESN'T ASK ABOUT PETE
ANYMORE.

14:09.333 --> 14:11.583
I'M WORRIED THAT HE WON'T
REMEMBER HIS DAD,

14:11.625 --> 14:14.041
BUT SOMETIMES I THINK
THAT'S BETTER.

14:14.083 --> 14:17.333
SURE. IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER,
THERE'S NOTHING TO MISS.

14:17.375 --> 14:20.041
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT I NEED--
AMNESIA.

14:20.083 --> 14:21.041
(chuckles)

14:21.083 --> 14:23.458
ALTHOUGH I'M ALREADY
STARTING TO FORGET THINGS.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.583
LIKE WHAT?

14:24.625 --> 14:26.375
OUR FIRST DATE,
ALLY AND I WENT

14:26.417 --> 14:29.041
TO THIS HOLE-IN-THE-WALL
RESTAURANT IN MEXICO

14:29.083 --> 14:30.834
WHILE WE WERE WORKING
DOWN THERE.

14:30.875 --> 14:32.875
I WAS WRITING
FOR "NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC."

14:32.917 --> 14:35.375
SHE WAS TAKING
THE PICTURES.

14:35.417 --> 14:37.875
I'VE BEEN RACKING MY BRAIN
FOR THE PAST THREE DAYS,

14:37.917 --> 14:40.041
BUT I CAN'T RECALL
THE NAME OF THE PLACE.

14:40.083 --> 14:42.041
ALLY WOULD KNOW.

14:42.083 --> 14:45.166
BUT SHE HASN'T
ANSWERED ME IN A WHILE.

14:45.208 --> 14:46.250
I AM SO SORRY.

14:46.291 --> 14:49.291
I CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW HARD THIS IS FOR YOU.

14:49.333 --> 14:53.375
I KEEP HOPING THAT
I CAN WILL HER TO WAKE UP.

14:53.417 --> 14:56.834
NONE OF THE DOCTORS CAN AGREE
AS TO WHEN THAT MIGHT BE.

14:56.875 --> 15:00.875
BUT AS LONG
AS A CHANCE EXISTS,

15:00.917 --> 15:03.041
I CAN'T GIVE UP.

15:03.083 --> 15:04.125
I WON'T.

15:09.959 --> 15:11.208
THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL!

15:11.250 --> 15:13.917
OH, MY--I'M SO EXCITED
FOR YOU GUYS. THIS IS AMAZING.

15:13.959 --> 15:16.041
AMAZING? I CAN'T HAVE
TOO MUCH COFFEE.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.667
I CAN'T EAT SUSHI. I'M SUPPOSED
TO WATCH MY MERCURY LEVELS

15:18.709 --> 15:20.875
AND BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR
TOXOPLASMA, LISTERIA, E.COLI.

15:20.917 --> 15:22.500
YEAH, SHE SHOULD KEEP
COMPLAINING TO AMELIA...
(speaking indistinctly)

15:22.542 --> 15:24.917
ABOUT PREGNANCY BECAUSE
IT MUST'VE BEEN REALLY FUN

15:24.959 --> 15:26.417
TO GO THROUGH THE NINE MONTHS

15:26.458 --> 15:28.125
AND THEN GIVE BIRTH TO A BABY
WITH NO BRAIN.

15:28.166 --> 15:30.083
...AND EVEN HERBAL TEA.
HERBAL TEA.

15:30.125 --> 15:32.250
AND THEN THE DAMN SHOPPING
HAS TO GET DONE

15:32.291 --> 15:33.500
BEFORE THEY GET HERE--

15:33.542 --> 15:35.083
THE BOTTLES, THE DIAPERS.

15:35.125 --> 15:36.458
AND WHAT THE HELL'S A LAYETTE?

15:36.500 --> 15:38.083
I CAN'T EVEN GO
TO THE STORE ANYMORE, THOUGH,

15:38.125 --> 15:41.333
BECAUSE I'M SO GASSY AND ITCHY--
MY BOOBS, MY BUMP.

15:41.375 --> 15:45.125
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS CRAP.
I HAVE A JOB. TWO JOBS.

15:45.166 --> 15:47.542
YOU KNOW, IF WE THREW YOU
A SHOWER--

15:47.583 --> 15:49.208
NO.
COME ON. THINK ABOUT IT.
IT COULD BE FUN.

15:49.250 --> 15:51.709
CHARLOTTE HATES SHOWERS.
COME ON. THINK ABOUT IT.
IT COULD BE FUN.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.083
MOSTLY SHE HATES THE WOMEN
THAT HAVE SHOWERS...
WE CAN STUFF OUR FACES
WITH GREAT FOOD...

15:53.125 --> 15:54.917
BECAUSE THEY'RE
ALL THAT WOMAN...
(speaking indistinctly)

15:54.959 --> 15:56.709
YOU KNOW, THE ONES THAT THINK
THE WORLD NEEDS TO STOP

15:56.750 --> 15:58.166
BECAUSE THEY'RE PREGNANT,

15:58.208 --> 16:00.041
LIKE THEY'RE THE FIRST ONES
TO EVER DO THAT.

16:00.083 --> 16:01.792
...SUGARY BAKED GOODS.

16:01.834 --> 16:05.000
I HATE SHOWERS.
YOU KNOW WHO HAS SHOWERS?

16:05.041 --> 16:06.875
THAT WOMAN--THE ONE I HATE,

16:06.917 --> 16:08.083
THE ONE WHO THINKS
THE WORLD'S GOTTA STOP

16:08.125 --> 16:09.750
BECAUSE SHE'S HAVING A BABY.

16:09.792 --> 16:10.917
LIKE SHE'S THE FIRST
ONE TO EVER DO IT.

16:10.959 --> 16:13.291
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
THERE IS NO DANGER

16:13.333 --> 16:14.875
OF YOU EVER BECOMING
THAT WOMAN.

16:14.917 --> 16:19.041
SECOND, YOU DO REALIZE THAT YOU
NEED EVERYTHING IN TRIPLICATE.

16:19.083 --> 16:20.083
SO IF I THROW YOU A SHOWER,

16:20.125 --> 16:21.333
YOU WON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ANY OF IT.

16:21.375 --> 16:22.709
I'LL REGISTER FOR YOU,

16:22.750 --> 16:23.875
AND BY THE TIME THE BABIES
ARE BORN,

16:23.917 --> 16:25.125
YOU'LL HAVE
EVERYTHING YOU NEED.

16:25.166 --> 16:28.041
SO YOU CAN BE GASSY
IN THE COMFORT OF YOUR OWN HOME.

16:28.083 --> 16:29.166
SO REALLY,
YOU'RE JUST BUYING ME STUFF?

16:30.792 --> 16:32.041
OKAY.

16:35.834 --> 16:38.125
WHAT SHE MEANT TO SAY WAS
"THANK YOU."

16:38.166 --> 16:39.166
(laughs)

16:39.208 --> 16:42.041
(pencil scratches paper)

16:42.083 --> 16:44.917
20 MINUTES FOR YOU,
30 FOR ME,

16:44.959 --> 16:46.834
AND TEN MINUTES FOR
"AMERICAN BAKE OFF."

16:46.875 --> 16:48.792
UH...
OKAY, I'LL GIVE YOU FIVE
IN "BAKE OFF,"

16:48.834 --> 16:52.333
BUT MY 30 IS NONNEGOTIABLE.
I NEED EVERY MINUTE OF IT.

16:52.375 --> 16:53.792
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

16:53.834 --> 16:56.000
US, COMMISERATING
ABOUT OUR LIVES

16:56.041 --> 16:58.041
OVER CORNED BEEF
ON MARBLE RYE.

16:58.083 --> 16:59.083
RIGHT. LUNCH.

16:59.125 --> 17:01.583
I TOTALLY FORGOT.

17:01.625 --> 17:02.834
DID YOU FORGET?

17:02.875 --> 17:04.041
OF COURSE NOT.
YOU FORGOT.

17:04.083 --> 17:05.667
(mouse clicks)
I FORGOT.

17:05.709 --> 17:07.250
AND ADDISON'S ABOUT TO DO
CHARLOTTE'S ULTRASOUND

17:07.291 --> 17:09.583
IN, LIKE, TEN MINUTES.
I DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT?
NO.

17:09.625 --> 17:11.625
OH, MY GOD.
PLEASE DON'T LET HER BE MAD.
IT MUST HAVE SLIPPED
YOUR MIND.

17:11.667 --> 17:13.667
I MEAN, I JUST CAN'T HANDLE THAT
RIGHT NOW.
WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE...

17:13.709 --> 17:15.125
I JUST WANT TO SEE
MY LITTLE SWEET POTATOES.
GIVEN WHAT YOU'VE GOT
GOING ON.

17:15.166 --> 17:16.625
YOU'RE NOT MAD, ARE YOU?

17:16.667 --> 17:17.875
I'M FURIOUS.

17:17.917 --> 17:19.625
YEAH, BLOW OFF
YOUR WIFE'S ULTRASOUND

17:19.667 --> 17:21.500
AND HAVE LUNCH WITH ME.
(kisses)

17:24.875 --> 17:27.000
YOU KNOW, IF YOU STILL WANT ONE,
WE CAN DO AN AMNIO.

17:27.041 --> 17:28.041
NO.

17:28.083 --> 17:29.041
I REALIZE THAT THERE ARE
ASSOCIATED RISKS,

17:29.083 --> 17:30.959
BUT I DO KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.875
OH, IT DOESN'T MATTER. EVEN
IF AN AMNIO TELLS US EACH KID

17:33.917 --> 17:37.041
HAS TWO HEADS AND IS COVERED IN
GILLS, THEY'RE STILL OUR BABIES

17:37.083 --> 17:40.291
AND THEY'LL STAY OUR BABIES.

17:40.333 --> 17:41.583
MM.

17:41.625 --> 17:44.417
HI, KING-FREEDMANS
OR FREEDMAN-KINGS.

17:44.458 --> 17:46.041
DID YOU MISS ME?

17:46.083 --> 17:48.291
WELL, HOW COULD THEY MISS YOU?
YOU TALK TO 'EM EVERY DAMN DAY.

17:48.333 --> 17:50.166
OKAY, SO THERE'S
BABY NUMBER ONE.
I READ IN ONE
OF THE PREGNANCY BOOKS

17:50.208 --> 17:52.208
THAT IF YOU TALK
TO YOUR CHILDREN EVERY DAY...
TWO, YOU CAN SEE HIS HAND...

17:52.250 --> 17:54.417
THEY'RE MORE SECURE
AND WELL-ADJUSTED.
AND THEN BABY NUMBER THREE...

17:54.458 --> 17:56.041
I DON'T KNOW. AT LEAST
THEY'LL KNOW ME RIGHT AWAY.

17:56.083 --> 17:58.041
IS HIDING
BEHIND THE OTHER TWO.

17:58.083 --> 18:00.041
IT IS PRETTY CROWDED IN THERE,

18:00.083 --> 18:03.583
BUT YOUR GIRLS...

18:03.625 --> 18:05.417
LOOK GOOD.
GIRLS?

18:05.458 --> 18:07.041
ALL THREE OF 'EM?
ALL THREE OF 'EM.

18:07.083 --> 18:10.208
(high-pitched voice)
GIRLS ARE AWESOME!

18:10.250 --> 18:11.125
OH, MY GOD!

18:11.166 --> 18:12.333
(laughs)

18:12.375 --> 18:13.959
OH, MAN!
OH!

18:14.000 --> 18:17.333
WHAT THE HELL AM I GONNA DO
WITH THREE GIRLS?

18:17.375 --> 18:18.375
(laughs)
(sighs)

18:20.917 --> 18:22.625
(pencil scratches paper)

18:22.667 --> 18:24.208
(blows air)

18:24.250 --> 18:25.917
(jangles keys)

18:25.959 --> 18:26.959
CHARLOTTE?

18:27.000 --> 18:29.709
(Charlotte groans)

18:29.750 --> 18:31.041
(exhales)

18:31.083 --> 18:33.333
YOU OKAY?

18:33.375 --> 18:34.625
IT'S 7:00 P.M.

18:34.667 --> 18:36.125
I'M TIRED.

18:36.166 --> 18:37.959
I'M ALWAYS TIRED.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.875
IT'S BECAUSE
I DON'T SLEEP ANYMORE.

18:40.917 --> 18:43.875
EVERYTHING'S TIGHT.
MY SOCKS ARE TIGHT.

18:43.917 --> 18:45.041
MY TOWELS ARE TIGHT.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.041
THE FREAKING MANGOES ARE
MAKING ME MISERABLE.

18:47.083 --> 18:49.917
YOU'D NEVER KNOW BECAUSE SHE'S
SO SHY ABOUT HER DISCONTENT.

18:49.959 --> 18:52.041
REALLY KEEPS IT ALL INSIDE.

18:52.083 --> 18:54.500
(exhales deeply) AND I'M
DOING THIS FOR GIRLS.

18:54.542 --> 18:56.041
WHY DO THEY ALL
HAVE TO BE GIRLS?

18:56.083 --> 18:57.125
GIRLS ARE AWESOME.

18:57.166 --> 18:59.041
YOU WERE A GIRL.

18:59.083 --> 19:01.500
AH.

19:02.625 --> 19:03.875
GIRLS...

19:03.917 --> 19:05.041
(scoffs)

19:05.083 --> 19:07.291
ARE SILLY AND STUPID.

19:07.333 --> 19:09.041
WHEN THEY TURN 12,
WE'RE GIVING THEM AWAY

19:09.083 --> 19:11.792
BECAUSE 12-YEAR-OLD GIRLS MAKE
STALIN LOOK LIKE GANDHI.

19:11.834 --> 19:12.917
(laughs)

19:12.959 --> 19:15.917
SURE, THEY'RE DISGUSTINGLY SWEET
TO THEIR DADDIES,

19:15.959 --> 19:20.041
BUT GIRLS HATE THEIR MAMAS
FROM PUBERTY TO AT LEAST AGE 20.

19:20.083 --> 19:24.166
MM. THE ONLY THING THAT'S WORSE
IS WHEN THEY BECOME WOMEN.

19:24.208 --> 19:28.041
SURE, THEY'LL TALK YOUR EAR OFF
ABOUT SISTERHOOD

19:28.083 --> 19:30.041
WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY
STABBING YOU IN THE BACK

19:30.083 --> 19:32.083
AND SLEEPING WITH YOUR HUSBAND.
WOMEN ARE AWFUL.

19:32.125 --> 19:34.041
YOU'RE NOT AWFUL.
YOU'RE PERFECT.

19:34.083 --> 19:36.083
AND YOU WILL RAISE THEM
TO BE JUST LIKE YOU.

19:36.125 --> 19:37.792
MM.

19:37.834 --> 19:39.709
AND THEN HOPEFULLY,
THEY WILL EACH MEET A MAN

19:39.750 --> 19:42.834
AS PATIENT AND SELFLESS
AS I AM.

19:42.875 --> 19:44.625
ALTHOUGH, I PROBABLY WON'T LET
THEM DATE UNTIL THEY'RE 30

19:44.667 --> 19:46.834
BECAUSE BEFORE I WAS SELFLESS
AND PATIENT,

19:46.875 --> 19:48.959
I WAS A MAN-WHORE WHO KNOCKED
A WOMAN UP IN A PARKING LOT

19:49.041 --> 19:52.667
AND MET MY WIFE
ON A SEX SITE.

19:52.709 --> 19:55.959
I HAVE MY WORK CUT OUT FOR ME,
DON'T I?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.041
(Violet)
THANKS FOR TAKING A LOOK.

19:58.083 --> 19:59.458
I KNOW THAT ALLY'S
ON LIFE SUPPORT,

19:59.500 --> 20:01.041
BUT WHAT ARE THE ODDS
THAT SHE--

20:01.083 --> 20:04.000
NO, THERE ARE NO ODDS.
ALLY HAS NO CORTICAL ACTIVITY.

20:04.041 --> 20:05.875
I'M GONNA HAVE A HARD TIME
IMAGINING

20:05.917 --> 20:08.125
ANY DOCTOR SAYING OTHERWISE.
I MEAN, SHE'S BRAIN-DEAD.

20:08.166 --> 20:11.333
SHE'S NOT WAKING UP EVER.
I'M SORRY, VIOLET.

20:11.375 --> 20:13.333
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:13.375 --> 20:15.959
HEY, GABI.
UH, THIS IS DR. SHEPHERD.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.041
SHE'S A NEUROSURGEON
AND A FRIEND.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.834
I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO GET ANOTHER OPINION.

20:19.875 --> 20:22.917
NO, I REALIZE THAT. BUT I JUST
THOUGHT THAT SINCE SHE'S HERE--

20:22.959 --> 20:26.000
GET OUT, BOTH OF YOU.

20:34.083 --> 20:35.041
(pencil scratches paper)

20:35.083 --> 20:36.166
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?

20:36.208 --> 20:37.917
THERE'S A SWIMMING POOL
IN THE BACK,

20:37.959 --> 20:40.458
A 6-CAR GARAGE,
AND 8 BEDROOMS.

20:40.500 --> 20:41.834
OKAY. HOW MUCH?

20:41.875 --> 20:44.000
$15 MILLION.

20:45.542 --> 20:46.667
IS--IS THAT TOO MUCH?

20:46.709 --> 20:49.000
NO, NOT IF WE WIN
THE LOTTERY.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.041
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?
SEE, FIVE BEDROOMS,

20:53.083 --> 20:54.375
BIG BACKYARD.

20:54.417 --> 20:57.041
WE COULD BUILD A TREE HOUSE.

21:00.083 --> 21:04.041
I THOUGHT I'D SURPRISE CHARLOTTE
WITH A HOUSE.

21:04.083 --> 21:05.750
WHO AM I KIDDING?
THIS IS LOS ANGELES.

21:05.792 --> 21:07.542
WE CAN'T AFFORD A HOUSE
FOR THIS BROOD.

21:07.583 --> 21:10.291
MAYBE IF ALL THE KIDS
SHARE ROOMS.

21:10.333 --> 21:12.041
WILL THEIR FRIENDS
MAKE FUN OF THEM

21:12.083 --> 21:14.041
FOR NOT HAVING THEIR OWN SPACE?
MAYBE THEY WON'T HAVE FRIENDS.

21:14.083 --> 21:15.959
MAYBE IF WE DON'T BUY
THE $15-MILLION HOUSE

21:16.000 --> 21:18.041
WITH THE POOL,
THEY'LL BE SHUNNED.

21:18.083 --> 21:21.834
IT DOESN'T JUST HAPPEN
WITH THE AMISH, RIGHT?

21:21.875 --> 21:24.041
IT KINDA LOOKS HAUNTED.

21:24.083 --> 21:26.041
OH. YEAH.

21:26.083 --> 21:27.959
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS,
IF YOU HAVE TO SHARE YOUR ROOM

21:28.000 --> 21:30.375
WITH A GHOST, HE WON'T
TAKE UP MUCH SPACE.

21:36.792 --> 21:38.041
HEY, WHEN THE BABIES COME,

21:38.083 --> 21:41.542
ARE YOU GONNA LIKE THEM
MORE THAN ME?

21:41.583 --> 21:43.458
MASON.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.041
I MEAN, IT HAPPENS.

21:45.083 --> 21:47.041
PEOPLE LIKE BABIES.
BABIES ARE CUTE.

21:47.083 --> 21:48.583
I SPEND A LOT OF TIME
WITH BABIES,

21:48.625 --> 21:50.333
AND THEY CAN BE
QUITE DISGUSTING.

21:50.375 --> 21:52.041
THEY GOT BALD,
LITTLE POINTY HEADS.

21:52.083 --> 21:53.917
ALL THEY DO IS EAT, SLEEP,
POOP, AND CRY.

21:53.959 --> 21:56.041
I MEAN, YOU'RE WAY MORE FUN
THAT THAT.

21:56.083 --> 21:57.041
REALLY?

21:57.083 --> 21:59.083
REALLY. AND BESIDES,

21:59.125 --> 22:01.625
WE'RE GONNA BE THE ONLY DUDES
IN THAT HOUSE.

22:01.667 --> 22:03.542
WE GOTTA STICK TOGETHER.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.041
RIGHT?

22:05.083 --> 22:07.917
OUR SURVIVAL DEPENDS ON IT.

22:07.959 --> 22:09.875
(chuckles)

22:14.583 --> 22:17.041
WELCOME, MOMMIES AND DADDIES,

22:17.083 --> 22:21.041
TO THE INCREDIBLE JOURNEY
OF CHILDBIRTH.

22:21.083 --> 22:23.291
LET'S START WITH
SOME BREATHING EXERCISES.

22:23.333 --> 22:25.166
DADS, PROP UP YOUR WIVES

22:25.208 --> 22:27.834
SO THEY CAN FOCUS
ON THEIR DIAPHRAGMS.

22:27.875 --> 22:29.208
JUST LIKE THAT.

22:29.250 --> 22:31.041
(indistinct conversations)
GOOD. GET COMFY.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.291
OKAY.

22:32.333 --> 22:35.375
NOW TAKE A SLOW, DEEP INHALE
THROUGH THE NOSE.

22:35.417 --> 22:36.667
(inhales deeply)

22:36.709 --> 22:39.041
FOLLOWED BY
A LONG, SLOW EXHALE

22:39.083 --> 22:41.041
OUT THROUGH THE MOUTH.
(exhales deeply)

22:41.083 --> 22:44.041
LIKE THESE PEOPLE REALLY
DON'T KNOW HOW TO BREATHE.

22:44.083 --> 22:47.041
BREATHE IN LOVE...
(inhales deeply)

22:47.083 --> 22:48.875
AND BREATHE OUT FEAR.
(exhales deeply)

22:48.917 --> 22:51.041
(Charlotte) UGH.
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

22:51.083 --> 22:52.792
IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO BREATHE IN LOVE

22:52.834 --> 22:54.375
WHEN YOU'RE BEING
SO NEGATIVE.

22:54.417 --> 22:56.166
SHOWTIME.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.041
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT?

22:58.083 --> 23:00.291
ONCE YOU BEAR DOWN TO PUSH
AN ENORMOUS HEAD

23:00.333 --> 23:02.458
THROUGH A NOT-QUITE-BIG-ENOUGH
OPENING

23:02.500 --> 23:04.041
THAT NO AMOUNT
OF KEGEL EXERCISES

23:04.083 --> 23:05.875
WILL EVER WHIP BACK
INTO SHAPE,

23:05.917 --> 23:07.041
YOU WON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS

23:07.083 --> 23:08.458
WHETHER OR NOT
YOU PAID ATTENTION

23:08.500 --> 23:09.834
DURING BREATHING EXERCISES.

23:09.875 --> 23:11.000
YOU'RE GONNA BE TOO BUSY
SCREAMING FOR DRUGS

23:11.041 --> 23:11.875
AND WISHING
THAT SON OF A BITCH

23:11.917 --> 23:13.667
WHO KNOCKED YOU UP
HAD NEVER BEEN BORN.

23:13.709 --> 23:16.917
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
MY FABULOUS WIFE.

23:16.959 --> 23:19.667
YOU'RE ALL DOING GREAT. ANOTHER
FIVE MINUTES OF BREATHING,

23:19.709 --> 23:20.917
AND WE CAN MOVE ON
TO SOME BALL WORK.

23:20.959 --> 23:22.875
(snickers) WHICH IS WHAT GOT US
HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

23:22.917 --> 23:24.834
(chuckles)

23:24.875 --> 23:26.625
(whispers) GOOD JOB.
KEEP BREATHING.

23:26.667 --> 23:29.458
YEAH, THIS ONE--
THINK MAYBE A TURKEY BASTER.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.834
OH. MISSIONARY POSITION.
LIGHTS OFF,

23:31.875 --> 23:34.000
BLINDS DRAWN, TWO MINUTES,
AND DONE.

23:35.083 --> 23:38.208
WHAT ABOUT THE CREEPY TWINS?

23:38.250 --> 23:42.041
OH. SEX SWING
AND A BALL GAG FOR SURE.

23:42.083 --> 23:44.041
SHH.
ARE YOU TWO GOING TO RUIN

23:44.083 --> 23:46.667
THIS BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE
FOR EVERYBODY?

23:46.709 --> 23:48.709
HONEY, LIGHTEN UP.
THAT'S IT.

ASKED ME IF IT WAS OKAY FOR HER
TO BE HAVING SEX

24:31.834 --> 24:33.083
THIS FAR ALONG
IN HER PREGNANCY.

24:33.125 --> 24:34.875

WAIT. DOESN'T HER O.B.
HAVE THAT COVERED?

24:39.125 --> 24:40.792
I DON'T THINK SHE LIKES HIM,

24:40.834 --> 24:42.041
AND APPARENTLY, SHE SAW
THIS THING ON THE INTERNET

24:42.083 --> 24:44.041
OF THIS WOMAN
WHO EXPERIENCED SEX

24:44.083 --> 24:45.709
AND THEN WENT INTO LABOR EARLY,

24:45.750 --> 24:47.333
AND THE BABY WASN'T
FULLY COOKED.
DUDE, IT'S SICK.

24:47.375 --> 24:51.083
I HOPE THAT WAS HER WORD
AND NOT YOURS.

24:51.125 --> 24:54.041
DID SHE, UH, DID SHE EXPERIENCE
ANY DISCOMFORT?

24:54.083 --> 24:56.041
NOT THAT SHE MENTIONED.
IS IT A HIGH-RISK PREGNANCY?

24:56.083 --> 24:57.208
IT'S...

24:57.250 --> 24:59.041
MULTIPLES. I THINK
IT'S MULTIPLES, SO...

24:59.083 --> 25:02.625
OH, REALLY? SO, UH, WHEN DID
YOU AND CHARLOTTE HAVE SEX?

25:02.667 --> 25:03.625
(laughs)

25:03.667 --> 25:05.291
LIKE A WEEK AGO.

25:05.333 --> 25:06.792
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TROLLING THE INTERNET

25:06.834 --> 25:08.125
FOR MEDICAL ADVICE ANYWAY?
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

25:08.166 --> 25:10.125
IT'S AL GORE'S FAULT
FOR INVENTING THE INTERNET,

25:10.166 --> 25:12.083
AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT
MAKE IT THIS HORRIBLE PLACE

25:12.125 --> 25:15.166
WHERE ALL MY DARKEST FEARS ARE
SO CONVENIENTLY REALIZED.

25:15.208 --> 25:17.291
CHARLOTTE IS FINE.
IF ANYTHING WAS GONNA GO WRONG,

25:17.333 --> 25:20.166
IT WOULD'VE HAPPENED BY NOW.
BUT SINCE YOU ARE AT 22 WEEKS,

25:20.208 --> 25:22.041
YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT BE A GOOD
IDEA TO KEEP IT IN YOUR PANTS.

25:22.083 --> 25:25.041
YEAH. CHARLOTTE'S NOT THE ONE
TO WORRY ABOUT.

25:25.083 --> 25:27.542
UH, YOU'RE ALREADY AT WHAT,
STAGE ONE DADDY FREAK-OUT.

25:27.583 --> 25:30.041
JUST WAIT
UNTIL THE BABIES COME.
STOP IT. I'M A PEDIATRICIAN.

25:30.083 --> 25:31.417
YEAH, WHO'S WORRIED
THAT HE MIGHT INDUCE LABOR

25:31.458 --> 25:32.959
WITH HIS LITTLE COOPER.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.041
OKAY.

25:35.083 --> 25:36.750
I'M AROUND KIDS ALL DAY.

25:36.792 --> 25:38.667
CHARLOTTE RUNS THE HOSPITAL.

25:38.709 --> 25:42.208
WE'RE PREPARED.
NO, YOU'RE
NEVER FULLY PREPARED.

25:42.250 --> 25:44.250
PLUS, YOU'RE HAVING THREE.
YOU'RE GONNA BE OUTNUMBERED.

25:44.291 --> 25:46.583
DR. COOPER FREEDMAN,
PEDIATRICIAN.

25:46.625 --> 25:48.041
NO, IT'S DIFFERENT.

25:48.083 --> 25:50.000
HOW?
IT JUST IS.

25:50.041 --> 25:51.041
THAT'S DEEP.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.041
LOOK, MY ADVICE?
CANCEL THE INTERNET.

25:53.083 --> 25:56.041
OKAY. I MAKE THIS, I'M GONNA BE
OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED

25:56.083 --> 25:59.041
AS THE BEST,
MOST PREPARED FATHER

25:59.083 --> 26:01.750
IN HISTORY OF THE WORLD.

26:01.792 --> 26:03.917
GET IT! TWO OUT OF THREE.
TWO OUT OF THREE.
ALL RIGHT. TRY AGAIN.

26:03.959 --> 26:06.083
TWO, ONE. FREEDMAN!

26:06.125 --> 26:08.083
(laughs)
(groans)

26:08.125 --> 26:11.125
(indistinct conversations)

26:16.083 --> 26:19.834
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE I'VE MADE A NEW FRIEND.

26:19.875 --> 26:23.041
YOU KNOW, A REAL FRIEND.

26:23.083 --> 26:26.458
AND I KNOW BY GETTING A CONSULT
FOR ALLY, I OVERSTEPPED,

26:26.500 --> 26:29.834
BUT, UM, I THINK OF YOU
AS A FRIEND,

26:29.875 --> 26:31.041
AND I WANTED TO HELP.

26:31.083 --> 26:33.041
I'M SORRY.

26:33.083 --> 26:35.041
WE ARE.

26:35.083 --> 26:36.458
WE ARE FRIENDS.

26:36.500 --> 26:39.083
BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,
TWO DOCTORS TOLD ME

26:39.125 --> 26:42.083
THE SAME THING THAT
YOUR FRIEND DID MONTHS AGO.

26:42.125 --> 26:44.041
BUT I...

26:44.083 --> 26:46.083
I COULDN'T HEAR IT.

26:46.125 --> 26:49.041
SO I WENT TO SEE A PSYCHIC--
WHICH IS INSANE, I KNOW--

26:49.083 --> 26:52.041
BUT SHE SAID
THERE WAS HOPE.

26:52.083 --> 26:54.041
I UNDERSTAND
WANTING TO HOLD ON, I DO,

26:54.083 --> 26:57.125
BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT...

26:57.166 --> 26:59.125
WAS PETE
THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE?

27:02.125 --> 27:04.000
(chuckles)

27:04.041 --> 27:05.041
ALLY IS.

27:05.083 --> 27:09.000
I WAS MARRIED
TO A WONDERFUL MAN

27:09.041 --> 27:10.125
FOR EIGHT AND A HALF YEARS.

27:10.166 --> 27:11.917
HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

27:11.959 --> 27:16.250
AND I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE
COULD BE MORE UNTIL I MET ALLY.

27:16.291 --> 27:18.458
AND THAT KIND OF LOVE?

27:18.500 --> 27:20.667
I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU
HOW SHE MADE ME FEEL.

27:20.709 --> 27:24.041
BUT I FELT THAT WAY EVERY DAY
FOR TEN YEARS.

27:24.083 --> 27:27.000
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

27:27.041 --> 27:29.041
AND IF I PULL THE PLUG,

27:29.083 --> 27:31.041
IF--IF SHE'S GONE,

27:31.083 --> 27:33.667
REALLY GONE,

27:33.709 --> 27:37.834
I'M AFRAID THAT NO ONE WILL
EVER LOVE ME LIKE THAT AGAIN.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.208
AND WHO THINKS LIKE THAT?

27:41.250 --> 27:45.834
I MEAN, SHE'S THE ONE
LYING THERE, STUCK IN LIMBO,

27:45.875 --> 27:48.125
AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT ME.

27:48.166 --> 27:51.166
I'M A TERRIBLE PERSON.

27:52.750 --> 27:56.291
WHEN PETE DIED,
I FELT RELIEVED.

27:56.333 --> 27:58.333
I'VE NEVER TOLD THAT
TO ANYBODY,

27:58.375 --> 28:02.041
NEVER SAID IT OUT LOUD.

28:02.083 --> 28:07.041
I MEAN, I MISS HIM. I DO. I MISS
HIM ALL THE TIME, EVERY DAY.

28:07.083 --> 28:09.375
BUT PETE WAS...

28:09.417 --> 28:12.041
PETE.

28:12.083 --> 28:15.208
HE WAS COMPLICATED
AND DIFFICULT,

28:15.250 --> 28:18.041
AND I TRIED FOR SO LONG
TO WORK OUT OUR ISSUES,

28:18.083 --> 28:20.041
AND...

28:20.083 --> 28:22.583
I MEAN, THE THING WAS,
WE DON'T HAVE ISSUES ANYMORE.

28:22.625 --> 28:24.166
YOU KNOW, HE WON'T FIGHT,
HE WON'T LEAVE,

28:24.208 --> 28:27.834
BECAUSE PETE IS--IS...

28:27.875 --> 28:29.041
PETE'S DEAD.

28:31.166 --> 28:33.250
THE ARGUMENT IS OVER.

28:36.083 --> 28:38.834
SO YEAH, YEAH, HE--

28:38.875 --> 28:40.250
HE WAS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE,

28:40.291 --> 28:42.250
AND IT--AND IT HURTS
THAT HE'S GONE,

28:42.291 --> 28:46.625
BUT I FELT R-RELIEF.

28:46.667 --> 28:48.208
I'M...

28:48.250 --> 28:50.083
I'M RELIEVED.

28:52.083 --> 28:55.041
SHE IS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE,

28:55.083 --> 28:58.041
AND I DON'T FEEL RELIEVED.

28:58.083 --> 29:01.083
I JUST WANT HER BACK.

29:10.125 --> 29:12.917
(pencil scratches paper)

29:12.959 --> 29:14.041
ISAAC INVITED ME

29:14.083 --> 29:16.041
TO HIS BROTHER'S BAR MITZVAH
NEXT MONTH.

29:16.083 --> 29:17.333
CAN I GO?

29:17.375 --> 29:18.333
SURE.

29:18.375 --> 29:20.417
AM I GONNA HAVE
ONE OF THOSE?

29:20.458 --> 29:22.250
DO YOU WANNA BE JEWISH?

29:22.291 --> 29:24.083
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

29:24.125 --> 29:26.041
WELL, THAT'S COOL IF IT'S
SOMETHING YOU WANNA DO.

29:26.083 --> 29:28.125
YOU CAN PAVE THE WAY
FOR THE TRIPLETS.

29:28.166 --> 29:29.291
WE'RE RAISING THEM JEWISH?

29:29.333 --> 29:31.542
UH, I KNOW WE HAVEN'T TALKED
ABOUT IT,

29:31.583 --> 29:33.500
BUT I WAS THINKING... MAYBE.

29:33.542 --> 29:34.834
WELL,
YOU DON'T GO TO TEMPLE.

29:34.875 --> 29:37.041
BUT THOSE TRADITIONS ARE
PART OF WHO I AM,

29:37.083 --> 29:39.041
AND THAT SPIRITUAL HERITAGE IS

29:39.083 --> 29:41.250
SOMETHING I WANT
FOR THE CHILDREN.
WELL, SO DO I,

29:41.291 --> 29:43.041
WHICH IS WHY I THINK
THEY SHOULD BE BAPTIZED.

29:43.083 --> 29:45.500
W--
IF THEY AREN'T BAPTIZED,
THEY WON'T GO TO HEAVEN.

29:45.542 --> 29:47.875
I STILL HAVE THE GOWN
I WAS CHRISTENED IN...
OKAY, I KNOW I EAT PORK
AND SHELLFISH...

29:47.917 --> 29:49.667
AND I DON'T FEEL
I NEED TO GO TO ISRAEL...
BEAUTIFUL LACE DRESS
MY GRANDMOTHER MADE BY HAND.

29:49.709 --> 29:51.166
AND I MARRIED A CHRISTIAN,
SO ONE COULD ARGUE

29:51.208 --> 29:53.166
THAT I SHOULD BE FLEXIBLE...
MY MOTHER
WAS BAPTIZED IN IT, TOO.

29:53.208 --> 29:55.041
WHEN IT COMES
TO RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION.
SO WERE MY BROTHERS.

29:55.083 --> 29:57.250
BUT BAPTISM? NO WAY.
I KNOW IT'S SOMEWHERE SAFE
AT MAMA'S HOUSE.

29:57.291 --> 29:59.917
ALL MY ANCESTORS WOULD ROLL OVER
IN THEIR GRAVES.

29:59.959 --> 30:01.959
MY MOM TOOK ME TO CHURCH
SOMETIMES,

30:02.000 --> 30:03.750
LIKE, FOR CHRISTMAS,
EASTER, TOO.

30:03.792 --> 30:05.792
WELL, THOSE SERVICES
ARE NICE, RIGHT?

30:05.834 --> 30:07.083
I WANT THE BABIES TO WAKE UP
ON CHRISTMAS MORNING

30:07.125 --> 30:08.583
TO PRESENTS
UNDER A TREE.

30:08.625 --> 30:10.083
I WANT TO HIDE
EASTER EGGS.

30:10.125 --> 30:12.166
OKAY, I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
BASE OUR CHILDREN'S RELIGION

30:12.208 --> 30:15.083
ON WHAT THE MOST ENTERTAINING
HOLIDAYS ARE.

30:15.125 --> 30:17.041
WHY NOT?
BECAUSE THAT IS A BATTLE
I WOULD TOTALLY LOSE.

30:17.083 --> 30:19.041
I MEAN, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH BEING ENTERTAINED?
I MEAN, NOBODY WANTS TO FAST
AT YOM KIPPUR.

30:19.083 --> 30:21.041
ISN'T HAVING FUN IMPORTANT?
AND YOU EAT MATZO
AND YOU DON'T POOP FOR A WEEK.

30:21.083 --> 30:23.041
ALTHOUGH CHRISTIANITY
ISN'T ALL FUN AND GAMES.
LIKE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES.

30:23.083 --> 30:24.792
THE SON OF GOD GETS NAILED
TO A CROSS...
DOES EITHER RELIGION
HAVE A HOLIDAY...

30:24.834 --> 30:26.125
AND HIS FATHER LOVED HIM.
WHERE YOU GET TO PLAY
VIDEO GAMES ALL DAY?

30:26.166 --> 30:28.041
HOW DOES THAT NOT GIVE A KID
NIGHTMARES?

30:28.083 --> 30:29.125
VIDEO GAME DAY.

30:29.166 --> 30:30.417
THAT WOULD BE SO COOL.

30:30.458 --> 30:32.041
OR WE COULD EXPOSE THEM
TO BOTH RELIGIONS.

30:32.083 --> 30:35.041
LET THEM DECIDE.
DOESN'T THAT SEEM CONFUSING?

30:35.083 --> 30:38.917
I'M NOT CONFUSED.
TWO RELIGIONS, TWICE THE GIFTS.

30:38.959 --> 30:39.959
THINK ABOUT IT, COOP.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
WE GOT PLENTY OF TIME.

30:44.875 --> 30:47.625
(pencil scratches paper)

30:47.667 --> 30:50.125
IT'S TOO SOON! THEY'RE ONLY
LETTUCE! THEY WON'T MAKE IT!

30:50.166 --> 30:52.083
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY, CHARLOTTE.
IT'LL BE OKAY.

30:52.125 --> 30:54.000
DR. MONTGOMERY'S
FIVE MINUTES OUT.

30:54.041 --> 30:55.458
WE'LL NEED A B.O.A. KIT
AND AN O.B. BED.

30:55.500 --> 30:57.166
AND GIVE HER NIFEDIPINE,
10 MILLIGRAMS.

30:57.208 --> 30:59.417
I'M ONLY 26 WEEKS!
YOU GOTTA STOP THE LABOR!

30:59.458 --> 31:01.208
ADDISON'S GONNA TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING. DON'T WORRY.

31:01.250 --> 31:03.208
IS SHE GONNA BE OKAY?
SHE'S GONNA BE FINE. OKAY?

31:03.250 --> 31:05.041
YOU REMEMBER NURSE FIONA? YOU GO
TO SCHOOL WITH HER DAUGHTER.

31:05.083 --> 31:06.250
OKAY, AMELIA'S GONNA COME
AND PICK YOU UP.

31:06.291 --> 31:08.000
IT WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE LIKE THIS.

31:08.041 --> 31:09.166
LABOR'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
FOR ANOTHER SIX WEEKS,

31:09.208 --> 31:11.125
AND I WAS GONNA BRING HER
ICE CHIPS AND RUB HER BACK

31:11.166 --> 31:13.041
AND ALL THE BABIES
WERE GONNA BE HEALTHY

31:13.083 --> 31:15.000
AND CHARLOTTE WAS
GONNA BE INCREDIBLY HAPPY

31:15.041 --> 31:16.166
BECAUSE SHE WOULD'VE KNOWN
THAT I WOULD'VE DONE

31:16.208 --> 31:19.041
EVERYTHING I COULD TO KEEP HER
AND THE BABY SAFE.

31:19.083 --> 31:21.458
IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO
BE LIKE THIS.

31:21.500 --> 31:23.458
CHARLOTTE. COME ON.
(Charlotte groans)

31:23.500 --> 31:27.041
(screaming)
(speaking indistinctly)

31:30.625 --> 31:32.709
(James) I STARTED
THE TOCOLYTICS,

31:32.750 --> 31:35.083
BUT SHE'S STILL LABORING.
OKAY, CHARLOTTE,
LET'S SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

31:35.125 --> 31:37.208
WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

31:37.250 --> 31:39.625
ONE OF THE TRIPLETS IS
PRESENTING AS A FOOTLING BREACH.

31:39.667 --> 31:41.500
WE NEED TO DELIVER RIGHT NOW.
THE LUNGS
AR-AREN'T DEVELOPED.

31:41.542 --> 31:43.792
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
I NEED THREE RESUSCITATION KITS

31:43.834 --> 31:45.375
AND THREE INCUBATORS.

31:45.417 --> 31:47.917
LET THE NICU KNOW THEY COULD BE
GETTING UP TO 3 26-WEEKERS.

31:47.959 --> 31:49.208
OKAY, CHARLOTTE, WE'RE GONNA
START DELIVERING NOW.

31:49.250 --> 31:51.375
OKAY? YOU READY? LET'S GO.

31:51.417 --> 31:53.250
(screaming)

31:53.291 --> 31:54.500
GOOD.

31:54.542 --> 31:57.709
GOOD. GOOD. THERE YOU GO.

31:57.750 --> 32:00.041
AAH!

32:00.083 --> 32:02.041
(monitor beeping rhythmically)
AAH.

32:02.083 --> 32:05.291
2.5 TUBE AND A STRAIGHT BLADE.

32:05.333 --> 32:07.041
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
ADDISON'S WORKING ON IT.

32:07.083 --> 32:09.041
ADDISON?
(Jake) CHARLOTTE,
I'M GOING TO EXAMINE YOU

32:09.083 --> 32:11.125
TO SEE IF THE REMAINING
MEMBRANES ARE INTACT, OKAY?

32:11.166 --> 32:13.333
OKAY. OKAY.
(whispers) IT'S OKAY.

32:13.375 --> 32:17.083
(beeping continues)

32:17.125 --> 32:20.208
IS SHE BREATHING?
WHY--WHY ISN'T SHE CRYING?

32:20.250 --> 32:22.041
ALL RIGHT. COME ON, KID.
HELP ME OUT HERE.

32:22.083 --> 32:23.625
OKAY, THE MEMBRANES ARE INTACT,
AND IF THE MEDS

32:23.667 --> 32:25.083
THAT DR. PETERSON GAVE YOU
WORKED, THEN--

32:25.125 --> 32:26.917
WHAT? THEN WHAT?
(woman) THE CONTRACTIONS
WILL STOP.

32:26.959 --> 32:29.041
UNTIL 32 WEEKS?

32:29.083 --> 32:30.500
BECAUSE THESE BABIES
AREN'T READY TO BE DELIVERED.

32:30.542 --> 32:32.291
I CAN STITCH UP YOUR CERVIX.
WHAT?

32:32.333 --> 32:33.458
THAT'LL DELAY DELIVERY
FOR A FEW WEEKS,

32:33.500 --> 32:35.291
GIVE THE OTHER BABIES
A CHANCE TO MATURE.

32:35.333 --> 32:36.500
JAKE, IS THAT SAFE?

32:36.542 --> 32:37.875
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT RISKS.

32:37.917 --> 32:40.375
MATERNAL MORBIDITY IN DELAYED
INTERVAL BIRTH IS ABOUT 30%.

32:40.417 --> 32:42.291
CHARLOTTE COULD DIE?

32:42.333 --> 32:44.583
HOW IS SHE?
SHE'S GOT ECTOPIA CORDIS.

32:44.625 --> 32:46.875
THE CHEST WALL HASN'T DEVELOPED
COMPLETELY TO COVER THE HEART.

32:46.917 --> 32:48.583
SHE'LL NEED SURGERY.

32:48.625 --> 32:50.333
OH, WHAT DO WE DO, COOPER?

32:50.375 --> 32:52.041
I JUST--I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE THESE BABIES,

32:52.083 --> 32:54.250
BUT I'M SCARED.
WHAT DO WE DO?

32:54.291 --> 32:55.917
OKAY, LOOK AT ME. LOOK AT ME.
HERE'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN--

32:55.959 --> 32:58.166
ADDISON IS GONNA SEW UP
YOUR CERVIX,

32:58.208 --> 32:59.458
AND I'M GONNA GO BE
WITH OUR DAUGHTER,

32:59.500 --> 33:01.417
AND THIS PLAN IS GONNA WORK.
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

33:01.458 --> 33:04.333
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE.
OKAY?

33:04.375 --> 33:05.583
OKAY. SAY IT.
