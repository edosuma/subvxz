01:01.700 --> 01:03.000
THAT WAS...

01:04.000 --> 01:05.500
OH, YEAH.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.200
TOP TEN, AT LEAST.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.700
MA-MAYBE TOP 20.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.500
NOT TOP TEN?

01:11.700 --> 01:12.700
WELL...

01:13.300 --> 01:14.800
THERE WAS PARIS.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.300
KAUAl.

01:17.100 --> 01:18.600
YANKEE STADIUM.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.000
OH, THAT PLACE IN THE POCONOS. YES.

01:21.300 --> 01:22.300
MYKONOS.

01:22.300 --> 01:23.500
CONEY ISLAND.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.700
AND THEN THERE WAS STATEN ISLAND.
OH, AND THE HOT AIR BALLOON.

01:26.700 --> 01:28.600
THE WESTMINSTER DOG SHOW. 

01:28.600 --> 01:31.300
THAT WAS...
THAT'S ONLY NINE.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.500
WELL, THE NIGHT WE MADE ALEXIS. 

01:36.700 --> 01:38.300
WE HAVE HAD FUN,
HAVEN'T WE?

01:38.300 --> 01:39.500
OH, YEAH.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.800
MAKES YOU WONDER WHY WE EVER
GOT DIVORCED. I KNOW, RIGHT?

01:43.100 --> 01:45.300
I MEAN, EXCEPT FOR YOU
HAVING AN AFFAIR

01:45.300 --> 01:47.600
WITH YOUR DIRECTOR
AND MOVING TO MALIBU

01:47.600 --> 01:49.500
AND SERVING ME
WITH DIVORCE PAPERS,

01:49.800 --> 01:51.800
I THINK
WE REALLY HAD A CHANCE.

01:53.500 --> 01:55.200
I'M MOVING BACK.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.400
BACK TO NEW YORK?

01:58.600 --> 01:59.900
I MISS IT.

01:59.900 --> 02:02.300
I MISS IT. I MISS ALEXIS.
I MISS YOU.

02:02.300 --> 02:04.500
UH, WHAT ABOUT YOUR CAREER?

02:04.500 --> 02:05.800
OH, L.A.'s CHANGED.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.800
UH, THE JUICY ROLES
JUST AREN'T THERE

02:07.800 --> 02:09.500
FOR AN ACTRESS
OF MY CALIBER.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.600
I NEED A CHANGE,
LIKE BROADWAY MAYBE.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.200
THE LEGITIMATE STAGE.
YEAH, BUT-

02:15.200 --> 02:16.500
TIME-OUT, HEY.

02:18.600 --> 02:21.900
MEREDITH, HOLD ON, HAVE YOU
REALLY THOUGHT THIS THROUGH?

02:21.900 --> 02:23.000
WHAT'S TO THINK ABOUT?

02:23.000 --> 02:25.900
YOU, ME, ALEXIS-ALL LIVING
IN THE SAME CITY-

02:26.100 --> 02:28.500
IT'S GONNA BE
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.

灵书妙探 第一季第6集</font>

02:45.100 --> 02:47.000
starring
NATHAN FILLION

02:51.000 --> 02:52.600
VIC'S
AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE,

02:52.600 --> 02:53.700
EARLY 20s.

02:53.700 --> 02:57.200
MULTIPLE STAB WOUNDS, CONTUSIONS
ON THE ARMS AND TORSO.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.900
THE BODY WAS DISCOVERED
BY A HOMELESS GUY.

02:58.900 --> 03:01.400
HE WAS BEATEN,
MAYBE TORTURED.

03:01.400 --> 03:04.400
LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND OF
RITUALISTIC KILLING. YOU THINK?

03:05.500 --> 03:06.500
HELLO?

03:07.600 --> 03:08.700
YOU OKAY?

03:09.700 --> 03:11.700
I HAD SEX WITH MY EX-WIFE
THIS MORNING.

03:12.200 --> 03:15.200
MY FIRST EX-WIFE-MEREDITH-
ALEXIS' MOM.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.200
AND SHE'S THINKING
ABOUT MOVING BACK TO NEW YORK.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.000
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
WOULD MEAN TO ME?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.900
THAT WOULD BE
A VERY SPECIAL BRAND OF HELL-

03:21.900 --> 03:24.500
THE HELL OF A DEEP-FRIED
TWINKIE. A DEEP-FRIED TWINKIE?

03:24.500 --> 03:26.700
YEAH, THE GUILTY PLEASURE
THAT YOU KNOW IS BAD FOR YOU,

03:26.700 --> 03:29.000
SO YOU ONLY DO IT ONCE, MAYBE
TWICE A YEAR FOR THE NOVELTY. 

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
BUT A DEEP-FRIED TWINKIE
EVERY DAY IS- CASTLE!

03:32.600 --> 03:36.200
WHAT? CRIME SCENE. DEAD
BODY. LITTLE RESPECT HERE.

03:36.200 --> 03:39.900
I DON'T THINK HE CAN HEAR ME. OKAY,
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE SELF-RESPECT THEN?

03:40.200 --> 03:42.900
FINE.
CHECK OUT HIS MOUTH.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.400
THERE'S PROBABLY
A LITTLE POUCH IN THERE.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.800
HOW DID YOU KNOW?
OPEN IT.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.500
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

04:03.200 --> 04:04.900
IT'S VODUN.
VODUN?

04:04.900 --> 04:07.100
WHAT, IS THAT SOME KIND
OF "STAR TREK" THING?

04:07.100 --> 04:08.400
NO, DUDE, IT'S A RELIGION,

04:08.400 --> 04:10.300
PRACTICED PRIMARILY
IN WEST AFRICA.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.000
WHAT? I READ, TOO.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.800
THE, UH, BLOOD IN THE BOWL-
MOST LIKELY ANIMAL.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.100
PART OF THE CEREMONY.

04:17.100 --> 04:19.200
THE POUCH IS AN OFFERING
TO THE SPIRITS,

04:19.200 --> 04:22.600
BUT I DON'T RECOGNIZE THE SYMBOL.
WELL, IF YOU DID, YOU'D BE A SUSPECT.

04:22.700 --> 04:26.400
SO HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ALL THIS?
RESEARCH FOR MY SIXTH DERRICK STORM NOVEL.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.000
"UNHOLY STORM."
YES, THANK YOU.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.300
AND, UH, VODUN'S NOT JUST
LIMITED TO WEST AFRICA.

04:31.300 --> 04:33.400
IT'S ALSO PRACTICED BY HAITIAN
AND DOMINICAN COMMUNITIES

04:33.400 --> 04:38.100
RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK. HAVE C.S.U. RUN
THE POUCH. HAVE AN M.E. TEST THE BLOOD.

04:38.100 --> 04:40.200
AND LET'S GET HIS FINGERPRINTS
IN THE SYSTEM,

04:40.200 --> 04:43.400
SEE IF THERE'S AN I.D.
THIS RITUAL-I ASSUME THEN

04:43.400 --> 04:45.700
IT WAS DONE FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE?
THAT'S ONLY IF YOU'RE ASSUMING

04:45.700 --> 04:48.400
THAT THE GUY DOING THIS WAS
RATIONAL. NO, NO, SHE'S RIGHT.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.800
IT MIGHT NOT MAKE SENSE
TO YOU OR ME,

04:49.800 --> 04:52.700
BUT, UH, IF WE FOUND OUT
WHY HE DID THIS,

04:52.700 --> 04:56.300
WE MIGHT FIND YOUR KILLER.
YEAH, THAT'S KINDA HOW WE DO IT.

04:56.400 --> 05:00.600
DO YOU STILL HAVE THE RESEARCH?
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I DO.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.200
"THE PURPOSE
OF THEIR RITUALS

05:02.200 --> 05:03.700
"WAS TO MAKE CONTACT
WITH THE SPIRITS

05:03.700 --> 05:07.700
"AND THE SPIRIT WORLD, TO GAIN
THEIR FAVOR THROUGH SACRIFICE.

05:07.700 --> 05:10.100
"STORM WAS PRETTY SURE
HE'D SACRIFICE ANYTHING

05:10.100 --> 05:12.500
"WHEN HE SAW THE AMULET SWAYING
RHYTHMICALLY BACK AND FORTH

05:12.500 --> 05:14.900
BETWEEN THE WOMAN'S BARE,
GLISTENING BREASTS."

05:14.900 --> 05:17.500
"UNHOLY STORM"?
YOU DRAGGED ME IN HERE

05:17.500 --> 05:19.600
SO THAT YOU COULD READ
FROM YOUR OWN BOOK?

05:19.600 --> 05:21.100
HEY, THERE'S A LOT
OF GOOD STUFF IN HERE,

05:21.100 --> 05:24.900
AND SOME OF IT IS FACTUAL.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

05:25.100 --> 05:28.200
I HAVE A MURDER TO SOLVE. I
THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT WE WERE DOING.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.700
OKAY, LOOK, I'M SO-
I- I AM JUST KIDDING.

05:30.700 --> 05:31.700
I DO HAVE ANOTHER SOURCE.

05:31.700 --> 05:35.000
AND YOU CALL YOUR EX-WIFE
A "DEEP-FRIED TWINKIE."

05:35.000 --> 05:37.900
OH, TRUST ME-AS ANNOYING
AND INTRUSIVE YOU THINK I AM,

05:37.900 --> 05:40.900
SHE IS A MILLION TIMES
WORSE. WHAT ABOUT ALEXIS?

05:40.900 --> 05:42.300
MAYBE SHE MISSES HER MOM.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.700
MAYBE IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO
HAVE HER BACK IN TOWN. YEAH, RIGHT.

05:45.700 --> 05:47.300
THIS ONCE,
WHEN ALEXIS WAS 9,

05:47.300 --> 05:49.700
MEREDITH DROPPED BY TO
TAKE HER OUT TO LUNCH. SO?

05:49.700 --> 05:51.700
IN PARIS. PARIS!

05:51.700 --> 05:53.100
AND THEN SHE ACTED LIKE
THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG.

05:53.100 --> 05:55.400
SHE'S AUNTIE MAME ON METH.
IF SHE'S SO BAD,

05:55.400 --> 05:57.200
THEN WHY'D YOU SLEEP WITH HER
THIS MORNING?

05:57.200 --> 05:58.800
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT CRAZY PEOPLE.

05:58.800 --> 06:02.900
THE SEX IS UNBELIEVABLE.
HOW SHALLOW ARE YOU?

06:02.900 --> 06:06.700
VERY. YOU KNOW, I DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.300
SOMEONE ORDER LUNCH?

06:11.300 --> 06:12.500
DETECTIVE BECKETT,

06:12.500 --> 06:14.500
MEET MY OTHER SOURCE.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.700
THE SYMBOL'S A VEVER.

06:17.700 --> 06:20.000
A REPRESENTATION OF ONE
WHO CAN OPEN CROSSROADS

06:20.000 --> 06:21.700
INTO THE SPIRIT WORLD.

06:21.700 --> 06:23.500
MICHELLE TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING
I KNOW ABOUT VODUN.

06:23.500 --> 06:24.800
WHICH OBVIOUSLY
ISN'T MUCH.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.300
THAT SCENE
WITH THE TOPLESS GIRL

06:26.300 --> 06:28.400
AND THE CHICKEN BLOOD-
WHAT WAS THAT?

06:29.400 --> 06:31.100
I TOOK A FEW LIBERTIES.

06:31.500 --> 06:32.700
YOU KNOW, FROM THE DESIGN,

06:32.700 --> 06:36.000
I'D SAY THIS ISN'T HAITIAN,
JAMAICAN OR DOMINICAN.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.900
THIS IS HARD-CORE NIGERIAN.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.900
WHAT ABOUT THIS CHARM?

06:41.700 --> 06:44.500
<i>THE CHARM'S AN OFFERING
TO A VODUN SAINT, OR LOA.</i>

06:44.500 --> 06:46.700
IN THIS CASE, IT'S OGUN.

06:47.100 --> 06:48.900
HE'S USUALLY CALLED UPON
TO HELP FIND SOMETHING

06:48.900 --> 06:51.400
THAT'S BEEN LOST. SO OUR
KILLER'S LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

06:51.400 --> 06:55.400
SOMETHING THE VICTIM ONCE POSSESSED.
MAYBE THAT'S WHY HE WAS TORTURED.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.800
COULD THE KIND OF CEREMONY

06:56.800 --> 07:00.400
INDICATE WHAT THE KILLER WAS
LOOKING FOR? UNFORTUNATELY, NO.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.500
HOW DO YOU KNOW
SO MUCH ABOUT THIS?

07:02.700 --> 07:04.700
BECAUSE I PRACTICE.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.700
MY JUNIOR YEAR,
I SPENT ABROAD IN NIGERIA.

07:07.700 --> 07:10.000
FELL IN LOVE WITH
THE RELIGION, THE CUISINE.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.300
MICHELLE OWNS THE BEST NIGERIAN
RESTAURANT IN THE CITY.

07:13.300 --> 07:16.400
IT'S FUNNY. I NEVER WOULD'VE
PEGGED YOU FOR THE OCCULT TYPE.

07:17.500 --> 07:20.800
OCCULT IS IN THE EYE
OF THE BEHOLDER, DETECTIVE.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.300
AS BIZARRE
AS VODUN MAY SEEM TO YOU,

07:23.300 --> 07:25.300
I ASSURE YOU, THE BELIEFS
OF WESTERN RELIGIONS

07:25.300 --> 07:27.600
SEEM JUST AS STRANGE
TO OUTSIDERS.

07:27.700 --> 07:30.100
HOW DO YOU LIKE
THE COW'S FOOT STEW?

07:30.700 --> 07:32.100
COW'S FOOT?

07:32.700 --> 07:34.100
YOU SAID IT WAS BEEF.

07:34.100 --> 07:37.100
TECHNICALLY, COW IS BEEF.
BESIDES, YOU LIKED IT.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.000
SO...

07:41.700 --> 07:45.400
THIS MURDER-IS, UM, IS THAT
A PART OF THE CEREMONY, AS WELL?

07:45.400 --> 07:49.100
NO. VODUN IS A PEACEFUL,
DEEPLY SPIRITUAL RELIGION

07:49.100 --> 07:50.200
PRACTICED BY
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

07:50.200 --> 07:52.200
ACROSS THE WORLD EVERY DAY.

07:52.200 --> 07:55.000
I DOUBT WHOEVER DID THIS
IS VERY PEACEFUL.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.100
NO.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.000
YOUR KILLER MAY BE VODUN,

07:59.000 --> 08:00.900
BUT THAT'S NOT WHY
THIS MAN'S DEAD.

08:00.900 --> 08:01.600
HE WAS KILLED

08:01.600 --> 08:04.800
BECAUSE HE HAD SOMETHING
THE KILLER DESPERATELY WANTS.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.900
AND HE'S NOT GONNA STOP
UNTIL HE FINDS IT.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.400
EXCUSE ME.

08:12.100 --> 08:12.900
BECKETT.

08:12.900 --> 08:14.800
YEAH, IT'S RYAN.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.700
WE GOT ANOTHER ONE.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.300
VICTIM'S NAME
IS DARCY CHO.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.100
SECOND-YEAR LAWYER
AT A FIRM DOWNTOWN.

08:25.100 --> 08:29.200
MULTIPLE STAB WOUNDS, JUST LIKE THE LAST ONE.
NEIGHBOR FOUND THE DOOR OPEN, CALLED THE SUPER.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.400
THIS IS WHAT THEY FOUND. THE
STAGING IS EXACTLY THE SAME.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.900
YEAH. WHEN THEY SAW
WHAT THEY HAD,

08:33.900 --> 08:36.299
WEST SIDE BOYS GAVE US A CALL.
LOOKS LIKE SHE PUT UP A FIGHT.

08:36.299 --> 08:40.500
DEFENSIVE WOUNDS ON HER FOREARM.
PARAPHERNALIA IS THE SAME AS THE OTHER MURDER.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.500
AND I FOUND ANOTHER CHARM
IN HER MOUTH.

08:45.300 --> 08:47.500
ANYTHING BACK FROM C.S.U.
ON THE OTHER SCENE?

08:47.500 --> 08:50.600
CANDLE'S BASIC PARAFFIN,
FOUND IN ANY BODEGA.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.300
FIGURE IT'S GONNA BE
THE SAME WITH THIS ONE.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.000
THE CLOTH
IS A COMMON RED FLANNEL.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.700
GLASS BOWL-MADE IN CHINA.

08:55.700 --> 08:58.100
WHAT ABOUT THE BLOOD?
CHICKEN BLOOD.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.200
MAYBE SHE USED THIS PURSE
TO DEFEND HERSELF.

09:02.200 --> 09:05.300
WE KNOW HE HASN'T FOUND WHAT
HE'S LOOKING FOR. HOW DO YOU KNOW?

09:05.300 --> 09:06.300
THE CHARM IN HER MOUTH.

09:06.300 --> 09:10.300
HE STILL NEEDS THE SPIRITS
TO GUIDE HIM. CHAPTER TEN.

09:11.600 --> 09:12.900
FIND OUT WHAT YOU CAN
ABOUT DARCY.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.900
SEE IF SHE KNEW
OUR FIRST VICTIM.

09:14.900 --> 09:17.000
I WANNA KNOW HOW
THESE MURDERS ARE CONNECTED.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.200
RIGHT.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.800
MR. SIMMONS,
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

09:26.800 --> 09:30.100
ALEXIS, I'M AFRAID
WE HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.600
WHAT? NO, IS IT MY DAD?
DID HE GET SHOT?

09:33.400 --> 09:35.300
IT'S NOT YOUR DAD, SWEETIE.

09:35.800 --> 09:38.000
MOM?
IT'S YOUR GRANDFATHER.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.100
HE PASSED AWAY
THIS MORNING.

09:40.100 --> 09:41.100
GRANDFATHER?

09:41.100 --> 09:43.900
I KNOW. IT'S A LOT
TO TAKE IN.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.600
MOM, I HAVE
A CALCULUS TEST TODAY.

09:46.600 --> 09:49.200
GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
I'M SURE MR. BROWN

09:49.200 --> 09:50.800
WILL LET YOU MAKE IT UP.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.900
THANK YOU, MR. SIMMONS,
FOR YOUR COMPASSION

09:53.900 --> 09:56.200
IN THIS TRYING TIME.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.700
LET'S GO, HONEY.
LOTS TO DO.

09:58.700 --> 10:01.600
UH, MOM, GRANDPA DIED
SIX YEARS AGO.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.100
I KNOW, BUT A DEATH
IN THE FAMILY-

10:03.100 --> 10:05.000
ALWAYS A GOOD EXCUSE
TO GET OUT OF SCHOOL.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.800
NO, IT'S A CREEPY EXCUSE.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.200
COME ON, I NEED
SOME ALEXIS TIME.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.600
DO YOU REALIZE I'VE BEEN
IN TOWN A WHOLE WEEK,

10:10.600 --> 10:13.000
AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN GONE SHOPPING?
WE'RE GOING SHOPPING ON SATURDAY...

10:13.000 --> 10:16.100
WHEN I DON'T HAVE SCHOOL. BUT
BENDEL'S IS HAVING ITS SALE NOW!

10:16.100 --> 10:19.500
I STUDIED ALL WEEK FOR THIS TEST.
OKAY, WHY BOTHER LEARNING MATH

10:19.500 --> 10:22.000
IF YOU DON'T GET TO APPLY IT
IN REAL-LIFE SITUATIONS,

10:22.000 --> 10:24.400
LIKE CALCULATING YOUR SAVINGS?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.900
COME ON, WHAT'S THE HARM?

10:26.900 --> 10:28.100
UNLESS YOU REALLY
WANT TO GO BACK

10:28.100 --> 10:30.800
AND TELL MR. SIMMONS
YOUR MOTHER'S A LIAR.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.700
FINE, BUT PROMISE WE'RE NOT
LEAVING THE CITY.

10:37.900 --> 10:39.300
COME ON!

10:39.900 --> 10:42.700
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
WHY WOULD SOMEONE KILL HER?

10:43.600 --> 10:45.300
MS. BUTTON,
YOUR OFFICE MANAGER

10:45.300 --> 10:47.100
SAID THAT YOU AND DARCY
WERE CLOSE.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.700
WE JOINED THE FIRM
AT THE SAME TIME.

10:49.700 --> 10:51.200
NEITHER OF US KNEW ANYONE
IN THE CITY,

10:51.200 --> 10:54.200
SO WE JUST, SORT OF,
BECAME BEST FRIENDS.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.200
DO YOU RECOGNIZE
THIS MAN?

11:00.200 --> 11:02.400
WE THINK HE AND DARCY
MIGHT BE CONNECTED.

11:02.900 --> 11:04.600
NO, I DON'T...

11:07.900 --> 11:09.400
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

11:09.400 --> 11:11.000
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING
TO FIND OUT.

11:14.600 --> 11:17.000
OH, GOD. YOU MEAN
THIS IS WHAT HAPP-

11:21.000 --> 11:24.200
WHO WOULD DO SOMETHING
LIKE THIS?

11:25.200 --> 11:27.700
I SPOKE TO JILL BUTTON,
DARCY'S B.F.F.

11:27.700 --> 11:28.900
SHE SAID SHE'S PRETTY FAMILIAR

11:28.900 --> 11:30.600
WITH ALL OF DARCY'S FRIENDS
AND CLIENTS,

11:30.600 --> 11:32.800
BUT SHE'S NEVER SEEN
THE VIC BEFORE.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.400
THE LAW FIRM DOES
SOME CORPORATE STUFF,

11:34.400 --> 11:35.600
SOME IMMIGRATION WORK,
BUT THERE'S NOTHING

11:35.600 --> 11:38.900
TO INDICATE ANY INVOLVEMENT IN SOMETHING
LIKE THIS. SO OUR FIRST VICTIM GETS KILLED

11:38.900 --> 11:41.000
IN A RELIGIOUS RITUAL,
AND THEN HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF

11:41.000 --> 11:43.700
WITH THIS LAWYER THE VERY SAME DAY? OH,
THERE'S A LAWYER JOKE THERE SOMEWHERE,

11:43.700 --> 11:46.100
I JUST CAN'T THINK OF IT. AND THEN
THE KILLER TOSSES THE WOMAN'S APARTMENT

11:46.100 --> 11:49.900
LOOKING FOR WHAT
- MONEY, DRUGS, WHAT? AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL, DARCY WAS CLEAN.

11:49.900 --> 11:52.300
YO, WE GOT A HIT
ON THE FIRST VICTIM'S PRINTS.

11:52.300 --> 11:55.300
I.N.S. DATABASE.
JAMAL BUONSI?

11:55.300 --> 11:56.700
NIGERIAN NATIONAL.

11:56.700 --> 11:59.400
ENTERED THE U.S. ON A STUDENT
VISA 18 MONTHS AGO.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.500
WAS ENROLLED AT N.Y.U.
AS AN EXCHANGE STUDENT.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.600
HIS VISA EXPIRED A YEAR AGO. YEP.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.800
LOOKS LIKE HE DECIDED
TO STAY. LUCKY HIM.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.700
ANY WORD ON HIS LAST KNOWN WHEREABOUTS?
YEAH, I WAS ABLE TO TRACK DOWN THE FAMILY

12:08.700 --> 12:10.500
THAT HE LIVED WITH
WHEN HE WAS A STUDENT.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.400
LAST TIME THEY SAW HIM,
HE WAS IN A CAB

12:12.400 --> 12:15.200
ON HIS WAY TO KENNEDY. I TAKE IT
THAT'S NOT THE END OF THE STORY.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.700
TURNS OUT THAT JAMAL
AND THEIR 13-YEAR-OLD SON

12:17.700 --> 12:18.800
WERE PRETTY CLOSE.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.300
COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO,
THE FOLKS DISCOVERED

12:20.300 --> 12:24.500
THAT THEY WERE STILL IN TOUCH.
JAMAL'S CELL PHONE NUMBER,

12:24.500 --> 12:28.200
BILLED TO AN ADDRESS ON EAST 3rd. THAT'S JUST
A FEW BLOCKS FROM WHERE JAMAL'S BODY WAS FOUND.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.000
EAST 3rd's RIGHT NEAR
DARCY CHO'S LAW FIRM.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.400
AND YOU SAID DARCY CHO'S FIRM
DID SOME WORK ON IMMIGRATION.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.200
YEAH. YOU AND ESPOSITO
TAKE A RIDE DOWN THERE.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.000
I WANT YOU TO LOOK
AT DARCY CHO'S CLIENT LIST.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.800
MAYBE JAMAL WAS USING ANOTHER NAME. WE'LL
GET A WARRANT FOR THE BILLING ADDRESS.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.100
FIND OUT
WHAT THIS GUY WANTS

12:40.100 --> 12:42.800
BEFORE THIS SON OF A BITCH
KILLS AGAIN, ALL RIGHT? YES, SIR.

12:48.700 --> 12:50.500
I WASN'T EXPECTING
A DOORMAN BUILDING,

12:50.500 --> 12:53.100
BUT A 6-STORY WALK-UP?

12:53.100 --> 12:54.800
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN
MY FIRST APARTMENT.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.700
THREE FLIGHTS UP
ON AN AIR SHAFT

12:57.700 --> 12:58.800
OVER A RESTAURANT.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.200
THE WHOLE PLACE SMELLED
LIKE CHICKEN WINGS.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.300
THEY COME HERE LOOKING
FOR A NEW START,

13:07.300 --> 13:08.800
AND THIS IS
WHAT THEY GET...

13:09.000 --> 13:10.400
SLUM HOUSING?

13:10.900 --> 13:13.700
STILL, FOR SOME, IT'S BETTER
THAN WHAT THEY LEFT.

13:16.300 --> 13:18.200
SOUNDS LIKE JAMAL
DIDN'T LIVE ALONE.

13:25.700 --> 13:26.500
YES?

13:26.500 --> 13:28.300
DETECTIVE BECKETT, NYPD.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.200
NO!

13:29.800 --> 13:31.500
HANDS! SHOW ME
YOUR HANDS!

13:31.500 --> 13:32.700
IMMIGRATION.

13:34.200 --> 13:39.500
I'M NOT IMMIGRATION.
EVERYBODY, JUST RELAX, OKAY?

13:40.900 --> 13:42.500
IF YOU'RE
NOT FROM IMMIGRATION...

13:42.900 --> 13:45.100
THEN WHO ARE YOU?
I'M A HOMICIDE DETECTIVE.

13:45.100 --> 13:47.800
I'M LOOKING FOR INFORMATION
ON JAMAL BUONSI.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.900
WE DON'T KNOW ANY JAMAL.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.500
THEN YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHY HIS CELL PHONE

13:54.500 --> 13:56.600
IS BILLED TO THIS ADDRESS?

14:01.900 --> 14:03.600
DETECTIVE.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.100
SAME RED FLANNEL.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.500
WHAT IS IT?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.500
WHOSE BED IS THAT?

14:30.800 --> 14:33.300
WE CAN LINK THE RED FLANNEL
TO TWO OTHER MURDERS.

14:33.300 --> 14:35.900
IN THIS COUNTRY, THAT PUTS YOU
IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.

14:35.900 --> 14:39.100
I'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG.
TWO PEOPLE ARE DEAD.

14:39.100 --> 14:42.600
ONE OF THEM IS A MAN
THAT YOU LIVED WITH.

14:46.500 --> 14:51.300
SAME RED FLANNEL, SAME CANDLES.
AND AGAIN, HERE.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.600
WHY DID YOU KILL HER, AZI?

14:53.600 --> 14:56.900
I DON'T KNOW THIS WOMAN.
I HAVEN'T KILLED ANYONE.

14:56.900 --> 14:59.100
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT
IT'S ALL JUST A COINCIDENCE

14:59.100 --> 15:02.200
THAT THESE THINGS WERE FOUND IN
YOUR APARTMENT UNDER YOUR BED?

15:02.200 --> 15:04.100
THEY WEREN'T MINE!

15:04.100 --> 15:05.600
THEY WERE
FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

15:05.600 --> 15:10.100
WHO? DO YOU WANT
TO GO BACK TO NIGERIA?

15:10.100 --> 15:13.200
BECAUSE I CAN ARRANGE THAT
WITH A SINGLE PHONE CALL.

15:14.900 --> 15:17.300
SO CAN HE.

15:19.900 --> 15:20.900
WHO?

15:22.300 --> 15:25.000
JAMAL WAS YOUR FRIEND,
WASN'T HE?

15:26.100 --> 15:27.000
YES.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.100
THEN DON'T YOU WANT US
TO CATCH WHO KILLED HIM?

15:29.100 --> 15:31.500
DON'T YOU WANT JUSTICE?

15:36.900 --> 15:39.400
HIS NAME IS CHARLES.

15:39.400 --> 15:42.600
CHARLES ONI.
CHARLES ONI.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.700
IMMIGRANTS KNOW THIS MAN.

15:45.700 --> 15:48.400
HE OWNS
THE PLACES WHERE WE LIVE.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.100
HE OWNS THE PLACES
WHERE WE WORK.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.500
AND WHAT ABOUT JAMAL?
DID HE WORK FOR HIM, TOO?

15:54.500 --> 15:56.900
AT HIS STORE ON CANAL STREET.

15:56.900 --> 15:57.800
BUT IT-

15:57.800 --> 16:00.700
IT-IT-IT WAS ONLY
TEMPORARY.

16:00.900 --> 16:03.600
HE WAS GOING TO
SAVE HIS MONEY TO-

16:03.600 --> 16:06.600
TO APPLY FOR A VISA,
BECOME LEGAL.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.200
AND ONI HAD A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

16:08.200 --> 16:09.400
NO.

16:10.100 --> 16:13.000
YESTERDAY, WHEN ONI CAME
LOOKING FOR JAMAL,

16:13.000 --> 16:16.300
HE SAID JAMAL
HAD TAKEN SOMETHING.

16:16.300 --> 16:18.300
BUT JAMAL WAS NOT A THIEF.

16:18.300 --> 16:20.400
BUT ONI INSISTED.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.000
HE SAY-
HE KNEW MY FATHER

16:23.000 --> 16:24.300
WAS THE PRIEST
OF OUR VILLAGE.

16:24.300 --> 16:28.000
SO HE MADE ME TO SHOW HIM
HOW TO INVOKE THE SPIRITS.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.600
WHAT DID JAMAL TAKE?

16:31.100 --> 16:33.000
ONI DIDN'T SAY.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.400
WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK?

16:34.400 --> 16:36.500
'CAUSE I WAS SCARED.

16:36.900 --> 16:39.000
BECAUSE
HE WOULD'VE KILLED ME.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.000
THE ONLY REASON
I AM TELLING YOU THIS NOW

16:42.000 --> 16:44.100
IS BECAUSE
JAMAL WAS A FRIEND.

16:44.300 --> 16:46.900
HE DID NOT DESERVE TO DIE
LIKE THAT.

16:46.900 --> 16:49.000
ONI WAS WRONG.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
CITY RECORDS
SHOW NO VENDOR'S LICENSE

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
FOR A CHARLES ONI
ON CANAL STREET.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.400
WELL, THE GUY'S
EXPLOITING ILLEGALS.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.000
I DOUBT HE'S GONNA USE
HIS REAL NAME.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.800
CLEARLY NOT. THE APARTMENT
IS OWNED BY A ROBERT BURNETT.

17:02.100 --> 17:03.600
NO LISTING
IN THE TRI-STATE AREA,

17:03.600 --> 17:05.599
AND THE ADDRESS
IS A P.O. BOX IN JERSEY.

17:05.599 --> 17:08.200
YO, YO,
LAW FIRM'S A DEAD END.

17:08.200 --> 17:10.200
THEY'VE NEVER HEARD OF ANYONE
NAMED JAMAL BUONSI,

17:10.200 --> 17:12.700
AND THERE WAS NOTHING SUSPICIOUS
IN DARCY'S CLIENT LIST.

17:12.700 --> 17:13.200
THAT'S PERFECT,

17:13.200 --> 17:15.599
'CAUSE OUR SUSPECT'S
NEVER HEARD OF DARCY CHO.

17:15.599 --> 17:18.000
WE STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
OUR TWO VICTIMS HAVE IN COMMON.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.300
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM. NO, I'M
NOT GONNA WAIT DOWNSTAIRS.

17:20.300 --> 17:24.300
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO PAYS
YOUR SALARY? ME AND MY TAXES.

17:24.300 --> 17:25.599
IS THAT-
UH, YEP.

17:25.599 --> 17:27.300
RICHARD! OVER HERE!

17:27.300 --> 17:29.500
DEEP-FRIED TWINKIE?
AFRAID SO.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.100
MEREDITH! WHAT A SURPRISE.

17:33.100 --> 17:34.600
I KNOW. ISN'T IT GREAT?

17:34.600 --> 17:36.700
IN L.A., NO ONE EVER
JUST STOPS BY.

17:36.700 --> 17:41.000
DON'T YOU JUST LOVE THIS TOWN?
MORE AND MORE BY THE MINUTE.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.200
UH, MEREDITH, THESE ARE
DETECTIVES RYAN, ESPOSITO

17:43.200 --> 17:44.500
AND DETECTIVE BECKETT.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.900
OH, BECKETT-
YOUR NEW MUSE.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.800
ALEXIS TOLD ME
ALL ABOUT IT,

17:48.800 --> 17:52.600
AND I SIMPLY
HAD TO STOP BY.

17:52.900 --> 17:55.200
YOU KNOW, I WAS
HIS INSPIRATION ONCE.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.300
WERE YOU NOW?

17:56.300 --> 18:00.600
STILL AM, FROM TIME TO TIME.
RIGHT, KITTEN?

18:00.600 --> 18:01.900
KITTEN?

18:02.400 --> 18:03.700
I HAD THIS DREAM ONCE,

18:03.700 --> 18:06.100
ONLY I WAS NAKED
AND FAR LESS EMBARRASSED.

18:06.100 --> 18:07.400
ANYWAY, WE WERE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

18:07.400 --> 18:08.600
AND I HAVE A DINNER TONIGHT,
SO I THOUGHT I WOULD

18:08.600 --> 18:11.600
DROP ALEXIS HERE INSTEAD OF
SCHLEPPING ALL THE WAY DOWNTOWN.

18:11.600 --> 18:15.300
IS THAT S.J.P.'s PURSE?
S.J.P.?

18:15.300 --> 18:16.900
SARAH JESSICA PARKER.

18:16.900 --> 18:19.300
SHE WORE ONE JUST LIKE IT
TO THE ARMANI SHOW IN MILAN.

18:19.300 --> 18:21.200
IT WAS ON "FASHION SCOOP DAILY"
LAST WEEK.

18:21.200 --> 18:26.700
WELL, ACTUALLY, THIS PURSE BELONGS TO
ONE OF OUR VICTIMS. OH, THAT IS SO TRAGIC.

18:26.700 --> 18:29.000
MORE TRAGIC, OF COURSE,
IF IT'D BEEN THE REAL THING.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.800
BUT... STILL. WHAT, ARE
YOU SAYING THIS WAS FAKE?

18:31.800 --> 18:33.400
WELL, LOOK AT THE LEATHER
AND THE STITCHING.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.500
IT'S TOTALLY A KNOCKOFF.
I MEAN, IT'S GOOD ENOUGH

18:35.500 --> 18:40.200
TO FOOL THE UNTRAINED SHOPPER, BUT
I HAVE A RETAIL EYE. CANAL STREET.

18:40.200 --> 18:43.400
CANAL'S WHERE THEY SELL THE
KNOCKOFFS-WATCHES, LUGGAGE. AND HANDBAGS.

18:43.400 --> 18:45.000
DARCY'S OFFICE
IS RIGHT NEAR CANAL.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.800
IF SHE WAS GONNA BUY A DESIGNER KNOCKOFF... SHE
MIGHT'VE GOT IT FROM THE STALL WHERE JAMAL WORKS.

18:48.800 --> 18:51.000
ONI'S STALL. THAT'S WHAT
CONNECTS OUR TWO VICTIMS.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.100
GET A SKETCH FROM AZI.

18:52.100 --> 18:53.500
MAYBE ONE OF
THE OTHER VENDORS

18:53.500 --> 18:56.500
WILL BE ABLE TO I.D. ONI'S
STALL. YOU GOT IT, BOSS.

18:56.500 --> 18:59.600
SEE? I ALWAYS
WAS YOUR LUCKY CHARM.

18:59.600 --> 19:03.200
JUST THINK OF THE THINGS
WE'LL DO ONCE I MOVE BACK.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.500
THAT'S ONI.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.800
THAT'S ONI

19:20.100 --> 19:21.400
CHARLES ONI.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.500
NOW WE HAVE A FACE
TO GO WITH THE NAME.

19:24.700 --> 19:27.300
SOMEONE ON CANAL STREET'S
GOTTA KNOW THIS GUY.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.100
WHERE'S CASTLE?

19:29.100 --> 19:30.300
HE WENT HOME.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.100
DEEP-FRIED TWINKIE, HUH?

19:33.300 --> 19:35.200
I DIDN'T ASK.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.700
WHY DON'T YOU
GET A CORKBOARD

19:47.700 --> 19:49.300
LIKE A NORMAL PERSON?

19:49.300 --> 19:51.800
WHY DON'T YOU KNOCK LIKE A
NORMAL PERSON? YOU KNOW MEREDITH

19:51.800 --> 19:56.200
KIDNAPPED ALEXIS FROM SCHOOL TODAY?
AND WE ALL PAID A HEFTY RANSOM.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.200
IT'S OUTRAGEOUS. YOU REMEMBER
YOUR TOURING PRODUCTION

19:58.200 --> 19:58.900
OF "A CHORUS LINE"?

19:58.900 --> 20:02.300
I ALMOST HAD TO REPEAT FIFTH
GRADE. OH, THAT WAS DIFFERENT.

20:02.300 --> 20:04.900
<i>I WAS WORKING
AND TRYING TO BE A MOTHER.</i>

20:04.900 --> 20:07.700
I WASN'T JUST WALTZING
INTO TOWN LIKE A DIVA,

20:07.700 --> 20:11.400
DISRUPTING EVERYBODY'S LIFE.
THAT'S WHO SHE IS. YOU KNOW THAT.

20:11.400 --> 20:14.100
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE

20:14.100 --> 20:16.500
HAVING MEREDITH BACK
IN NEW YORK,

20:16.500 --> 20:20.800
HOW IT'S GOING TO AFFECT YOU? YOU
MEAN HOW IT'S GOING TO AFFECT YOU.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.600
ALL OF US, ACTUALLY.

20:22.600 --> 20:23.800
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO, MOTHER?

20:23.800 --> 20:25.500
IT'S NOT LIKE I COULD BAN HER
FROM NEW YORK.

20:25.500 --> 20:28.700
AND THIS WHOLE THEATER THING-
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

20:28.700 --> 20:33.100
YOU KNOW SHE HASN'T
LANDED A ROLE IN MONTHS?

20:33.100 --> 20:34.800
THAT'S RIGHT.
I MADE A COUPLE OF CALLS.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.800
WHY DO YOU THINK
SHE'S MOVING BACK TO NEW YORK?

20:36.800 --> 20:39.500
SHE CAN'T GET ARRESTED
IN L.A.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.300
I WONDER IF SHE COULD GET
ARRESTED IN NEW YORK.

20:41.300 --> 20:44.200
I KNOW PEOPLE NOW. AND
DOES SHE HONESTLY THINK

20:44.200 --> 20:47.000
THAT SHE'S JUST GONNA SHOW UP
WITH A REEL OF, WHAT,

20:47.000 --> 20:49.200
"ACCORDING TO JIM"
GUEST SPOTS,

20:49.200 --> 20:51.600
AND PUSH
SOME REAL ACTOR ASIDE,

20:51.600 --> 20:53.800
SOME ACTOR WHO HAS...

20:54.600 --> 20:56.700
WHO HAS
DEDICATED THEIR ENTIRE LIFE

20:56.700 --> 21:00.000
TO THE GREATEST PROFESSION
IN THE WORLD?

21:00.600 --> 21:02.800
YOU DON'T CHOOSE THE THEATER.

21:02.800 --> 21:05.000
THE THEATER CHOOSES YOU.

21:05.900 --> 21:08.400
WHY DID YOU MARRY HER,
ANYWAY?

21:08.400 --> 21:11.600
I DON'T KNOW, MOTHER.
MAYBE SHE REMINDED ME OF YOU.

21:15.200 --> 21:16.700
LOOK AT THIS CRAP.

21:16.700 --> 21:18.800
ALL MY YEARS ON THE FORCE,
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD

21:18.800 --> 21:21.700
WHY WE NEVER SHUT THESE
GUYS DOWN. COME HERE.

21:22.300 --> 21:25.100
SEE, THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO BE A GUCCI.

21:25.300 --> 21:26.600
BUT IF YOU LOOK CLOSE,

21:26.600 --> 21:30.500
INSTEAD OF THE "G.G.," THE INITIALS SAY
"C.C." I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE, BRO.

21:30.500 --> 21:32.200
BUT NOT EXACT. AND THAT'S
WHAT KEEPS THESE GUYS

21:32.200 --> 21:33.600
FROM GETTING BUSTED.
SEE, TECHNICALLY,

21:33.600 --> 21:38.300
IT'S NOT AN IMITATION. IT'S
AN HOMAGE. AN "HOMAGE." RIGHT.

21:38.300 --> 21:41.000
YOU LADIES PICKING OUT SOMETHING
PRETTY FOR YOURSELVES?

21:41.900 --> 21:44.900
YOU GOT THE WARRANT?
WHICH ONE IS IT?

21:55.600 --> 21:57.300
THIS PLACE HAS BEEN TRASHED.

21:59.500 --> 22:01.700
YOU GUYS,
SAME CHANEL BAGS.

22:01.700 --> 22:05.400
THAT'S WEIRD-SHREDDED,
LIKE OUR VICTIM'S PURSE.

22:05.400 --> 22:08.500
MAYBE DARCY WASN'T
USING IT TO DEFEND HERSELF.

22:08.500 --> 22:09.600
BECKETT.

22:16.500 --> 22:17.400
THIS ONE LOOKS DIFFERENT.

22:17.400 --> 22:18.800
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
THE ONES THAT WE FOUND

22:18.800 --> 22:20.900
IN THE OTHER VICTIMS' MOUTHS.

22:20.900 --> 22:22.800
I'VE SEEN
THIS SYMBOL BEFORE.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.300
THAT'S THE SYMBOL
FOR DEATH.

22:25.800 --> 22:27.200
WHY WOULD A GUY
MARK HIS OWN STALL

22:27.200 --> 22:28.200
WITH THE DEATH SYMBOL?

22:28.200 --> 22:30.900
HE WOULDN'T. THE SYMBOL
WAS MEANT FOR HIM.

22:31.300 --> 22:33.500
CHARLES ONI'S
BEEN MARKED FOR DEATH.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
THE LININGS
HAVE ALL BEEN CUT OUT.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.400
ALL OF THIS STUFF
IS IMPORTED, RIGHT?

22:40.400 --> 22:43.600
YEAH. YOU KNOW, KNOCKOFFS WOULD
BE THE PERFECT DELIVERY SYSTEM

22:43.600 --> 22:45.700
FOR A SMUGGLER. YEAH, BUT
WHAT ARE THEY SMUGGLING?

22:45.700 --> 22:47.000
THE ONLY PERSON
WHO CAN TELL US THAT

22:47.000 --> 22:50.200
HAS BEEN MARKED FOR DEATH.
WELL, IF HE IS STILL ALIVE,

22:50.200 --> 22:52.900
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY INCENTIVE
TO STICK AROUND.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.300
CASTLE?

22:55.700 --> 22:56.900
WHERE'S HE GOING?

22:57.300 --> 22:59.400
NOTIFY PASSPORT CONTROL.
GET 'EM THE SKETCH OF ONI

22:59.400 --> 23:02.300
AND TELL 'EM TO PUT HIS NAME
AND ALIASES ON THE NO-FLY LIST.

23:02.300 --> 23:03.700
YOU GOT IT, BOSS.

23:03.900 --> 23:05.300
CASTLE?

23:06.500 --> 23:09.000
CASTLE!
I'M ON TV.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.300
<i>ARE YOU HAVING A BREAKDOWN?
NOT A BREAKDOWN. A BREAKTHROUGH.</i>

23:11.300 --> 23:14.600
AND I REALLY AM RUGGEDLY HANDSOME, AREN'T
I? I'M WAITING FOR THE BREAKTHROUGH.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.200
LOOK BEHIND ME.
IF THAT CAMERA'S RECORDING...

23:17.200 --> 23:19.800
THEN WE'D BE ABLE TO SEE
WHO TRASHED THE STALL.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.200
WHAT CAN I SAY?

23:23.200 --> 23:25.700
PEOPLE LIKE TO SEE THEMSELVES
ON TELEVISION.

23:25.700 --> 23:28.300
I MEAN, YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE
THE THINGS PEOPLE DO

23:28.300 --> 23:30.300
IN FRONT OF A CAMERA.
I'M LISTENING.

23:30.300 --> 23:32.300
LIKE, THIS ONE CHICK,
SHE'S STANDING THERE

23:32.300 --> 23:34.400
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE STORE,
AND SHE STARTS TO TAKE OFF

23:34.400 --> 23:36.800
HER, UH-
JUST SHOW US THE RECORDINGS

23:36.800 --> 23:38.700
FROM THE PAST COUPLE
OF DAYS, OKAY?

23:38.700 --> 23:43.000
HER BLOOD SUGAR GETS LOW, SHE GETS
A LITTLE CRANKY. ZIP IT... KITTEN.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T
SHOW YOU THE RECORDING.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.600
YOU NEED A WARRANT?
WOULDN'T HELP. SOLD IT.

23:47.600 --> 23:50.600
SOLD THE CAMERA IN THE WINDOW?
SOME GUY ROLLS IN HERE YESTERDAY,

23:50.600 --> 23:52.500
ASKED FOR THAT ONE
SPECIFICALLY.

23:52.500 --> 23:55.100
I TOLD HIM WE GOT OTHERS,
ONES WITH BOXES.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.600
BUT HE WANTS THE ONE IN THE
WINDOW. WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE?

23:57.600 --> 24:01.500
6', BIG, BLACK,
HAD AN ACCENT.

24:03.100 --> 24:04.100
WAS IT HIM?

24:04.100 --> 24:07.000
NO, HE OWNS THE STALL ACROSS
THE STREET. YOU KNOW HIM?

24:07.000 --> 24:11.800
WE SAY HI. BUT THIS GUY-
HE SEEMED, UH, HEAVY.

24:11.800 --> 24:14.800
NOT IN THE PHYSICAL SENSE-JUST
SOMETHING ABOUT HIM, YOU KNOW?

24:14.800 --> 24:18.900
LIKE HE'D SEEN THINGS
- BAD THINGS. WHAT ELSE?

24:18.900 --> 24:21.000
HE PAID CASH-RETAIL.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.500
I MEAN, AT MY PRICES? HE DIDN'T
EVEN TRY TO NEGOTIATE ONCE.

24:24.500 --> 24:27.300
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO WORK
WITH A POLICE SKETCH ARTIST?

24:27.300 --> 24:29.000
WOULDN'T A REAL PICTURE
BE BETTER?

24:29.000 --> 24:31.800
YOU SAID THAT HE TOOK
THE CAMERA AND THE RECORDINGS.

24:31.800 --> 24:34.900
LADY, THIS IS
AN ELECTRONICS STORE.

24:34.900 --> 24:37.800
I GOT CAMERAS
ALL OVER THIS PLACE.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.600
YEAH, HE DOES LOOK LIKE
THE KIND OF GUY

24:39.600 --> 24:43.200
WHO'D PAINT A DEATH SYMBOL ON YOUR FLOOR. WHAT
I DON'T GET IS, WHY WOULD HE WANT THE CAMERA?

24:43.200 --> 24:46.600
'CAUSE HE HAD THE SAME IDEA WE DID. WE WANTED
THE CAMERA BECAUSE WE WANTED TO FIND HIM.

24:46.600 --> 24:50.400
WELL, WHAT WAS HE LOOKING FOR?
AND WHAT WAS INSIDE THE PURSES?

24:52.300 --> 24:55.700
ESPOSITO. YEAH. REALLY?

24:55.700 --> 24:58.600
WHEN? NO, NO, NO.
ABSOLUTELY.

24:58.600 --> 25:00.100
BRING HIM IN.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.700
T.S.A. JUST PULLED
CHARLES ONI

25:02.700 --> 25:04.800
OUT OF THE SECURITY LINE
AT J.F.K. OFF OUR SKETCH.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.100
GOOD CALL, BRO.
THANK YOU.

25:06.100 --> 25:07.100
WHERE WAS HE GOING?

25:07.100 --> 25:11.100
NIGERIA. UNDER THE NAME
ROBERT BURNETT.

25:14.500 --> 25:16.200
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.100
I WAS GOING HOME
TO VISIT MY FAMILY.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.700
THEN WHY'D YOU ONLY HAVE
A ONE-WAY TICKET?

25:21.100 --> 25:23.000
MY MOTHER IS ILL.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.200
I DID NOT KNOW
WHEN I'D BE RETURNING.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.900
MUST BE NICE, BEING ABLE
TO SEE YOUR MOTHER,

25:27.900 --> 25:30.600
SOMETHING THAT JAMAL BUONSI
WILL NEVER GET A CHANCE TO DO.

25:30.600 --> 25:34.300
WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE INVOLVED
IN BOTH OF THESE MURDERS.

25:34.300 --> 25:37.500
AZI-THE MAN THAT YOU
INTIMIDATED INTO FINDING JAMAL-

25:37.500 --> 25:40.600
HE IS VERY EAGER
TO TESTIFY AGAINST YOU.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.300
APPARENTLY, HE TAKES
HIS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS

25:42.300 --> 25:43.400
VERY SERIOUSLY.

25:43.400 --> 25:46.800
DOESN'T BELIEVE VODUN SHOULD BE USED
TO KILL PEOPLE. I DIDN'T KILL ANYONE.

25:46.800 --> 25:48.900
THEN WHY WERE YOU
LOOKING FOR JAMAL?

25:50.800 --> 25:53.500
TELL ME SOMETHING-
WHAT'S IN THE PURSE?

25:55.300 --> 25:57.600
WHAT ARE YOU SMUGGLING,
MR. ONI?

25:58.500 --> 25:59.800
I WANT A LAWYER.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.500
ARE YOU SURE? BECAUSE IF
YOU GET A LAWYER,

26:01.500 --> 26:02.800
YOU'LL BE OUT OF HERE
IN ABOUT AN HOUR,

26:02.800 --> 26:04.300
AND I WON'T LET YOU
LEAVE TOWN,

26:04.300 --> 26:09.100
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU
WANT, ISN'T IT, TO LEAVE TOWN?

26:10.600 --> 26:12.800
YOU SCARE A LOT OF PEOPLE,
MR. ONI-

26:12.800 --> 26:15.800
IMMIGRANTS, ILLEGALS.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.700
TELL ME...

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
WHO SCARES YOU?

26:23.600 --> 26:25.000
I DON'T KNOW THIS MAN.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.300
HE KNOWS YOU.

26:26.800 --> 26:30.200
MATTER OF FACT,
HE'S MARKED YOU FOR DEATH.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.400
JAMAL WORKED FOR YOU,
AND HE'S DEAD.

26:34.600 --> 26:37.100
DARCY CHO-SHE JUST
BOUGHT A PURSE FROM YOU,

26:37.100 --> 26:38.700
AND NOW SHE'S DEAD.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.400
WHY?

26:42.300 --> 26:43.900
I WON'T TALK
WITHOUT PROTECTION.

26:43.900 --> 26:47.900
I CAN'T PROTECT YOU
UNLESS YOU TELL ME FROM WHAT.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.300
HIS NAME IS MUKHTAR BAYLOR.

26:54.300 --> 26:56.500
VERY BAD, VERY DANGEROUS.

26:57.100 --> 26:59.200
FORMER CHILD SOLDIER.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.300
THEY CALL HIM
"THE BUTCHER OF BENIN."

27:01.300 --> 27:04.400
WHAT'S HE DOING
IN THE U.S.?

27:04.400 --> 27:08.100
HE TRAFFICS-DRUGS, WOMEN,
WHATEVER WILL MAKE HIM MONEY.

27:09.400 --> 27:12.800
IT IS HIM THAT KILLED JAMAL
AND THE WOMAN.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.300
WHY?

27:18.300 --> 27:20.100
IF I TELL YOU,

27:20.800 --> 27:22.600
YOU WILL PROTECT ME?

27:23.800 --> 27:25.500
ONI'S A COUNTERFEITER.

27:25.500 --> 27:28.000
HE GETS PAPERS FOR ILLEGALS-
PASSPORTS, VISAS,

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
WHATEVER THEY NEED.
A REAL FRIEND TO THE COMMUNITY.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.900
ONI ALSO PROVIDED BAYLOR
WITH DOCUMENTS

27:31.900 --> 27:34.500
FOR HIS TRAFFICKERS. SEWN
INSIDE THE LINING OF HIS PURSES.

27:34.500 --> 27:37.900
YEAH, WHICH HE KEEPS IN THE BACK OF THE STALL.
ONLY HE DIDN'T COUNT ON "FASHION SCOOP DAILY."

27:37.900 --> 27:40.900
THE WEB SITE. YEAH, THE
ARTICLE ON SARAH JESSICA PARKER?

27:40.900 --> 27:44.200
APPEARS THERE WAS A RUN ON THE
PURSES. YEAH. OUR FIRST VIC, JAMAL-

27:44.200 --> 27:45.800
YEAH?
HE SOLD BAGS OUT FRONT.

27:45.800 --> 27:47.100
HE DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT ONI'S SCAM.

27:47.100 --> 27:49.100
WHEN HE RAN OUT OF BAGS,
HE SOLD THE ONES FROM THE BACK.

27:49.100 --> 27:50.800
WHY DIDN'T HE JUST GET ONI
TO FORGE MORE DOCUMENTS?

27:50.800 --> 27:54.700
IT TAKES TIME, AND BAYLOR DOESN'T HAVE TIME.
THE PAPERS ARE FOR BAYLOR'S BROTHER IN AFRICA.

27:54.700 --> 27:56.600
THE NIGERIAN OFFICIALS
ARE CLOSING IN ON HIM

27:56.600 --> 27:57.600
FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING.

27:57.600 --> 28:00.100
IF BAYLOR DOESN'T GET HIM
TO THE U.S. SOON,

28:00.500 --> 28:02.600
THEY'LL EXECUTE HIM. ONI SAYS BAYLOR
OPERATES OUT OF A WAREHOUSE DOWNTOWN.

28:02.600 --> 28:06.200
FIND THIS DIRTBALL BEFORE HE
MURDERS SOMEONE ELSE, ALL RIGHT?

28:11.100 --> 28:12.100
WHERE DID THE BAG
COME FROM?

28:12.100 --> 28:13.500
OH, SORRY, THAT'S MINE.

28:13.500 --> 28:15.100
I FELT, GIVEN EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED,

28:15.100 --> 28:16.800
I SHOULD BE PREPARED.

28:17.600 --> 28:20.100
I GOT THIS
SPECIAL ORDER.

28:20.100 --> 28:21.300
AND LOOK.

28:22.300 --> 28:24.300
"WRITER"?
COOL, HUH?

28:24.300 --> 28:25.800
NO, NOT COOL.

28:26.300 --> 28:29.900
YOU DON'T NEED A VEST. IF
YOU SHOOT ME, DO I NOT BLEED?

28:29.900 --> 28:32.300
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET SHOT.
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

28:32.300 --> 28:34.700
BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING
NOWHERE NEAR THE GUNFIRE.

28:34.700 --> 28:37.300
YOU'RE STAYING HERE. YES,
WE'VE SEEN HOW WELL THAT WORKS.

28:37.300 --> 28:39.800
STAY HERE, CASTLE,
AND DON'T DO ANYTHING.

28:42.300 --> 28:45.300
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
OUR GUY. GOT HIM? YEAH.

28:45.300 --> 28:46.400
LET'S GO.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.300
<i>DAD! DAD! DAD!</i>

29:41.300 --> 29:44.100
<i>DAD! DAD! DAD!
DAD! DAD! DAD!</i>

29:44.100 --> 29:45.600
<i>DAD! DAD! DAD!</i>

29:45.600 --> 29:49.100
<i>DAD! DAD! DAD!
DAD! DAD! DAD!</i>

29:52.900 --> 29:55.800
I'M GONNA-
I'M GONNA JUST GET THAT.

30:01.000 --> 30:01.500
Hi.

30:01.500 --> 30:04.400
ALEXIS? WHAT'S WRONG?
Richard, guess what.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.500
MEREDITH?
I found a place.

30:06.500 --> 30:09.200
<i>A PERFECT PLACE.
IT'S LIGHT, SPACIOUS</i>

30:09.200 --> 30:11.100
AND ONLY A MILLION SIX.

30:11.100 --> 30:14.900
BUT THE TEXT SAID "ALEXIS."
IT SAID IT WAS AN EMERGENCY.

30:15.100 --> 30:17.500
WELL, HOW ELSE WAS I
GONNA GET YOU TO CALL ME BACK?

30:18.300 --> 30:20.100
B- BUT-
ARE YOU AT THE LOFT?

30:20.100 --> 30:22.000
Mm, I was in the neighborhood
and I had to pee,

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
so I had Eduardo let me in.
So I called the realtor,

30:25.000 --> 30:28.100
AND HERE'S THE THING-I MAY
NEED YOU TO COSIGN THE LOAN.

30:28.300 --> 30:29.800
MEREDITH, WE'RE DIVORCED.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.600
I- I'M NOT GONNA COSIGN
A LOAN FOR YOU.

30:31.600 --> 30:34.400
IT'S FOR ALEXIS, TOO. I MEAN,
IT'S ONLY A ONE-BEDROOM,

30:34.400 --> 30:36.900
BUT YOU WANT HER
TO BE COMFORTABLE WHEN SHE VISITS, RIGHT? 

30:36.900 --> 30:39.000
LOOK, CAN I
CALL YOU BACK? I'M RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE

30:39.000 --> 30:41.300
OF CAPTURING A VERY DANGEROUS
NIGERIAN DRUG LORD...

30:41.300 --> 30:42.800
IT'S KIND OF A THING.

30:42.800 --> 30:46.100
OKAY, LATER THEN.
HEY, RICHARD?

30:46.100 --> 30:47.100
YEAH.

30:47.500 --> 30:48.900
THANKS.

30:48.900 --> 30:51.000
FOR WHAT?
Putting up with me.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.300
I know I've been
a handful, but...

30:53.300 --> 30:56.300
once things settle down,
I think it's gonna be great.

30:56.300 --> 30:57.900
THAT'S THE GUY.
THAT'S THE GUY!

30:57.900 --> 31:00.100
HEY! HEY!

31:00.500 --> 31:02.100
HEY! THE-

31:02.600 --> 31:04.400
HEY! THE-

31:06.600 --> 31:08.300
ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING
TO ME?

31:08.300 --> 31:10.200
HEY!

31:16.000 --> 31:18.100
THIS IS GONNA BITE ME
IN THE ASS.

31:18.100 --> 31:19.800
CASTLE!

31:24.500 --> 31:26.000
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU DIDN'T GET THE PLATE?

31:26.000 --> 31:29.300
UH, THERE WAS A- IT WAS
COMING- WHAT KIND OF CAR WAS IT?

31:29.300 --> 31:31.600
UH, IT WAS BIG. IT WAS AN
S.U.V., I THINK. YOU THINK?

31:31.600 --> 31:34.800
WHAT ABOUT THE COLOR?
UM, BLACK. UH, DARK BLUE.

31:34.800 --> 31:38.000
UH, IT'S-IT'S VERY HARD
BEING A WITNESS.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.700
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GUYS
EVER GET A CONVICTION.

31:39.700 --> 31:42.100
I'M USUALLY REALLY GOOD
WITH THE DETAILED STUFF.

31:42.100 --> 31:46.200
I JUST-I GOT DISTRACTED. YEAH, YOU
WERE ROLLING CALLS DURING A TAC STRIKE.

31:47.500 --> 31:50.800
INTERESTING. HE WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE INSIDE THE BUILDING!

31:50.800 --> 31:52.300
WHAT ABOUT THE COLOR
OF YOUR SHIRT?

31:52.300 --> 31:53.800
WHAT IS THAT RIGHT NOW?
IS THAT BLACK OR BLUE?

31:53.800 --> 31:56.900
I- I-I COULDN'T QUITE TELL.
THE SUN WAS IN MY EYES.

32:10.800 --> 32:11.900
WEIRD.

32:11.900 --> 32:13.500
REALLY WEIRD.

32:17.300 --> 32:18.800
IT'S THE SAME RED FLANNEL.

32:20.300 --> 32:23.800
HEY... VODUN GUY'S
A YOGA NUT.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.100
WELL, JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE
A COLD-BLOODED KILLER

32:25.100 --> 32:27.300
DOESN'T MEAN YOU
DON'T TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

32:35.100 --> 32:36.300
YOU GUYS.

32:36.800 --> 32:39.200
THE CAMERA
FROM THE ELECTRONICS STORE.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.700
SEE? NOT A COMPLETE BUST.

32:46.100 --> 32:47.800
THERE'S JAMAL.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.800
AND DARCY CHO.

32:53.500 --> 32:55.200
GO BACK,
GO BACK, GO BACK, GO BACK. OKAY.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.700
MORE. MORE. ALL RIGHT.

32:56.700 --> 33:00.200
STOP. WELL, LOOKS LIKE
SOMEONE ELSE BESIDES DARCY

33:00.200 --> 33:03.600
BOUGHT A CHANEL BAG FROM JAMAL.
AND SHE'S CARRYING A YOGA MAT.

33:03.600 --> 33:05.200
THAT'S WHY HE BOUGHT THE CAMERA.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.600
BAYLOR'S LOOKING FOR HER.
HE WANTS HIS PASSPORT

33:07.600 --> 33:10.500
SO HE'S HUNTING DOWN EVERYONE THAT BOUGHT
THAT PURSE. EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE IN THE CITY.

33:10.500 --> 33:13.100
HE'LL NEVER FIND HER. HE FOUND
DARCY CHO. HE'LL FIND HER.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.600
NOT IF WE FIND HER FIRST.

33:15.600 --> 33:17.200
YOU ZOOM IN ON HER HAND.

33:19.200 --> 33:21.700
SHE'S GOT A COFFEE
FROM JAVA LOFT.

33:22.100 --> 33:24.500
SO? SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR A YOGA STUDIO

33:24.500 --> 33:26.600
NEAR A JAVA LOFT
SOMEWHERE OFF CANAL STREET.

33:26.600 --> 33:29.000
GOTTA BE A DOZEN POSSIBILITIES.
BAYLOR'S GOT A HEAD START.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.700
YES, BUT I'VE GOT
AN AWESOME SERVICE PLAN NOW.

33:31.700 --> 33:32.600
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR YOGA GIRL.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.000
YOU GUYS SEE IF ANYONE ELSE
BOUGHT THAT PURSE.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.800
THERE ARE FOUR JAVA LOFTS
WITHIN FIVE BLOCKS

33:38.800 --> 33:40.700
OF CANAL STREET.
AND YOGA STUDIOS?

33:40.700 --> 33:42.700
THE TIME STAMP
ON THE VIDEO WAS 3:22.

33:42.700 --> 33:46.000
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A YOGA STUDIO NEARBY

33:46.000 --> 33:48.400
WITH A CLASS THAT ENDS
AT ABOUT 3:00.

33:48.400 --> 33:50.800
<i>MAYBE THE WOMAN WAS
ON HER WAY TO YOGA CLASS.</i>

33:50.800 --> 33:52.100
YOU EVER TRY
DOING A HALF MOON POSE

33:52.100 --> 33:53.800
CRANKED UP ON CAFFEINE?

33:53.800 --> 33:55.300
IT COMPLETELY THROWS OFF
YOUR CHI.

33:55.300 --> 33:59.300
TRUST ME, SHE BOUGHT HER COFFEE AFTER
CLASS. A CLASS FINISHING AROUND 3:00 P.M.

33:59.300 --> 34:01.800
WOULD GIVE HER ENOUGH TIME
TO BUY A COFFEE.

34:01.800 --> 34:05.200
BUT ENOUGH TIME TO FINISH IT
BEFORE CANAL STREET.

34:05.200 --> 34:06.500
GOT IT.

34:08.300 --> 34:09.500
NYPD.

34:09.500 --> 34:10.699
DO YOU KNOW THIS GIRL?

34:10.699 --> 34:13.600
DIANA EDWARDS. WHAT'S SHE
DONE? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

34:13.600 --> 34:17.800
YOU'RE THE SECOND COP THAT'S COME IN
LOOKING FOR HER. ANOTHER COP WAS HERE?

34:17.800 --> 34:23.000
YEAH, HE JUST LEFT A FEW MINUTES AGO.
BAYLOR. WE NEED DIANA'S ADDRESS RIGHT NOW.

34:24.800 --> 34:27.600
DIANA EDWARDS! NYPD!
OPEN UP!

34:27.600 --> 34:28.800
CAN I KICK IT DOWN?

34:28.800 --> 34:30.199
SORRY, KITTEN.

34:30.600 --> 34:31.699
NYPD!

34:31.699 --> 34:34.600
OKAY, OKAY!
TAKE IT EASY!

34:34.600 --> 34:37.600
DETECTIVE BECKETT, NYPD.
ARE YOU DIANA EDWARDS? YEAH.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.300
HEY!
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

34:39.300 --> 34:40.300
FINE.

34:41.199 --> 34:43.699
WE HAVE A VIDEO SURVEILLANCE
OF YOU PURCHASING A CHANEL BAG

34:43.699 --> 34:47.000
ON CANAL STREET TWO DAYS AGO. WOW,
I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE CRACKING DOWN

34:47.000 --> 34:49.300
ON THE KNOCKOFFS, BUT I
- WHERE'S THE BAG?

34:49.300 --> 34:50.800
OVER THERE.

34:55.699 --> 34:57.400
EXCUSE ME!

34:57.700 --> 35:00.700
HEY! WHAT ARE YOU
DOING THAT FOR?

35:03.800 --> 35:05.000
WHAT'S GOING ON?

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
YOU ARE A VERY LUCKY LADY. I
DON'T UNDERSTAND. AM I IN TROUBLE?

35:08.000 --> 35:10.200
NO. BUT FROM NOW ON,
ALWAYS BUY RETAIL.

35:10.200 --> 35:13.100
DETECTIVE BECKETT. I NEED A UNIT AT 91st AND BROADWAY

35:15.300 --> 35:17.200
CALL 9-1-1!

35:27.000 --> 35:31.500
GIVE ME THE PASSPORT!
PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON, NOW!

35:33.200 --> 35:35.300
GIVE ME THE PASSPORT!

35:38.600 --> 35:40.100
BAYLOR, ANY MINUTE NOW,

35:40.100 --> 35:42.500
THIS PLACE IS GONNA BE
CRAWLING WITH COPS!

35:42.500 --> 35:45.400
DON'T MAKE THINGS WORSE
THAN THEY ARE!

35:52.100 --> 35:55.700
GIVE ME WHAT I WANT, AND I WALK AWAY! I'VE
WRITTEN THIS SCENE ABOUT A HUNDRED TIMES.

35:55.700 --> 35:57.300
WE GIVE HIM WHAT HE WANTS,
YOU KNOW HOW IT ENDS?

35:57.300 --> 36:00.200
BADLY. AND BY "BADLY," I
MEAN US DEAD. JUST STAY DOWN.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.200
<i>YOU STAY DOWN. I CAN'T
SHOOT HIM FROM DOWN HERE.</i>

36:02.200 --> 36:04.000
YEAH, HE CAN'T
SHOOT YOU, EITHER.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.600
I CAN'T SEE HIM.

36:11.200 --> 36:12.900
HE'S MOVING.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.300
I'VE ONLY GOT
TWO ROUNDS LEFT.

36:15.800 --> 36:17.100
I NEED A CLEAN SHOT.

36:17.100 --> 36:19.300
I GOTTA GET EYES
ON HIM SOMEHOW.

36:21.200 --> 36:23.200
WHAT'S WITH YOU AND PHONES?

36:24.900 --> 36:26.600
I'M NOT PLAYING GAMES!

36:26.700 --> 36:29.100
I DON'T HAVE AN ANGLE ON HIM
FROM DOWN HERE.

36:29.100 --> 36:32.300
I WILL KILL YOU BOTH!
OKAY.

36:32.700 --> 36:34.400
WHEN WE SHOOT,
HE SHOOTS.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.000
HE'LL BE EXPOSED.

36:38.200 --> 36:40.800
I'LL SET THE PICK,
YOU TAKE HIM DOWN.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.500
SET THE PICK WITH WHAT?

36:42.800 --> 36:45.400
THIS. YOU'RE GONNA GET YOURSELF SHOT.

36:45.400 --> 36:48.000
NOT IF YOU MAKE YOUR SHOT COUNT. CASTLE!

36:48.000 --> 36:50.200
JUST BE READY.

36:54.200 --> 36:55.500
THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING!

36:55.500 --> 36:56.600
NOW!

37:06.000 --> 37:07.800
I'D SAY THIS DESERVES
A TOAST.

37:20.600 --> 37:22.200
BAYLOR'S GONNA MAKE IT.

37:22.900 --> 37:24.300
YOU OKAY, CASTLE?

37:24.300 --> 37:26.200
MY FIRST GUN BATTLE.

37:26.200 --> 37:28.100
<i>YOUR LAST GUN BATTLE.</i>

37:28.800 --> 37:29.800
DON'T BE
SO PESSIMISTIC.

37:29.800 --> 37:31.300
I THINK I HANDLED MYSELF
PRETTY WELL.

37:31.300 --> 37:34.600
YEAH. YOU PROBABLY
SAVED MY LIFE. PROBABLY?

37:34.800 --> 37:36.600
I DEFINITELY SAVED
YOUR LIFE.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.400
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS, DON'T YOU?

37:38.500 --> 37:41.300
IT MEANS YOU OWE ME.
OWE YOU WHAT?

37:41.300 --> 37:43.800
WHATEVER I WANT.

37:44.400 --> 37:49.500
AND YOU KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT I WANT, DON'T YOU?

37:49.700 --> 37:55.500
YOU KNOW WHAT I REALLY,
REALLY WANT YOU TO DO?

37:56.700 --> 37:59.600
NEVER... EVER...

37:59.600 --> 38:02.000
CALL ME "KITTEN."

38:15.200 --> 38:16.200
DAD?

38:16.200 --> 38:17.800
YEAH, SWEETIE?

38:21.000 --> 38:22.400
HYPOTHETICALLY,

38:22.400 --> 38:25.200
IS IT OKAY TO LOVE SOMEONE

38:25.200 --> 38:27.200
BUT NOT WANT THEM AROUND
ALL THE TIME?

38:28.600 --> 38:30.000
YOU MEAN MOM?

38:30.000 --> 38:32.100
I LOVE HER. I DO.

38:32.100 --> 38:34.800
I KNOW YOU DO,
AND I'M GLAD YOU DO.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.800
BUT, DAD,
SHE DRIVES ME CRAZY.

38:38.800 --> 38:39.700
YEAH.

38:39.700 --> 38:41.300
THAT'S WHAT MOMS DO.

38:42.500 --> 38:44.400
BUT IF SHE LIVES HERE...

38:44.700 --> 38:48.500
RICHARD?
RICHARD. ALEXIS.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.200
YOUR SECRET'S SAFE
WITH ME.

38:53.100 --> 38:57.100
HELLO? ANYONE HOME? HELLO?

38:57.800 --> 38:59.700
YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE
WHAT HAPPENED.

38:59.700 --> 39:01.400
I GOT A CALL FROM MY AGENT.

39:01.400 --> 39:05.300
I'VE BEEN OFFERED A HUGE
ROLE IN A NEW INDIE FILM. OH-

39:07.700 --> 39:09.100
MOM, THAT'S AWESOME.

39:09.100 --> 39:13.200
IT IS. BUT... HERE'S
THE BAD NEWS, SWEETIE.

39:13.500 --> 39:14.800
I'M GONNA
HAVE TO PUT MY PLANS

39:14.800 --> 39:19.100
TO MOVE BACK TO NEW YORK ON HOLD.
OH... HOW EVER WILL WE MANAGE?

39:19.100 --> 39:20.000
WELL, THAT'S OKAY, MOM.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.800
IT SOUNDS LIKE A HUGE
OPPORTUNITY. IT IS. IT REALLY IS.

39:23.800 --> 39:26.200
BESIDES, IT'S NOT LIKE
BROADWAY'S GOING ANYWHERE.

39:26.200 --> 39:29.200
I CAN ALWAYS DO THEATER
WHEN I'M TOO OLD FOR HI-DEF.

39:30.600 --> 39:32.700
UH, SO WHEN DO YOU NEED
TO BE BACK IN L.A.?

39:32.700 --> 39:35.400
TOMORROW. I NEED TO GET BACK
TO MY HOTEL AND PACK,

39:35.400 --> 39:38.000
BUT I WANTED TO TELL YOU
THE GOOD NEWS.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
THERE'S SO MUCH FUN STUFF
WE DIDN'T GET TO DO.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
BUT I'LL BE BACK SOON,
I PROMISE. I KNOW.

39:44.000 --> 39:44.800
I LOVE YOU, MOM.

39:44.800 --> 39:48.900
THANKS FOR TAKING ME
SHOPPING. OH, ANYTIME.

39:50.500 --> 39:52.200
GOOD-BYE, MARTHA.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.500
MEREDITH.

39:55.900 --> 39:58.900
YOU KNOW I ALWAYS HATE
TO SEE YOU GO.

40:00.800 --> 40:03.400
NEXT TIME-TOP TEN.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.700
TOP TEN.

40:14.100 --> 40:15.600
OKAY, DAD, SPILL.

40:15.600 --> 40:17.100
WHAT?

40:17.100 --> 40:18.400
WHAT DID YOU DO?

40:18.400 --> 40:19.700
NOTHING.

40:20.500 --> 40:22.700
OH. MY BUSINESS MANAGER
CALLED

40:22.700 --> 40:24.600
WITH AN EXCELLENT
INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY-

40:24.600 --> 40:27.300
A SMALL, ARTSY
INDEPENDENT FEATURE.

40:27.300 --> 40:29.200
OH, THAT'S MY BOY!

40:29.200 --> 40:31.000
EH, SHE'S PERFECT
FOR THE ROLE.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.500
I'M DOING THEM A FAVOR.
I THINK.

40:33.700 --> 40:36.200
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND. RAISING
ONE PARENT'S HARD ENOUGH.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.900
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO
IF I HAD TO RAISE TWO.

40:41.300 --> 40:43.300
THERE WASN'T
A LITTLE PART FOR ME...

40:43.300 --> 40:45.300
NO, NO. IN THE ARTSY... UH, NO.
