<i>- Previously on "Bel-Air"...</i>

00:01.385 --> 00:02.283
Just get the ball
out to Curt.

00:02.383 --> 00:03.484
<i>End of discussion.</i>

00:06.183 --> 00:08.082
Getting that W's
the only thing that matters.

00:08.182 --> 00:10.121
We straight on that now?
Here's my card.

00:10.221 --> 00:11.481
Let me know when you want
to discuss his future.

00:13.980 --> 00:15.200
- Geoffrey.
- Phil.

00:15.300 --> 00:16.399
<i>James Lewis,
there's something</i>

00:16.499 --> 00:17.319
<i>not right with him
at the firm.</i>

00:17.418 --> 00:18.319
Get into it for me, will you?

00:18.419 --> 00:19.637
I'm on it.

00:19.737 --> 00:21.397
We should take
our relationship up a notch.

00:21.497 --> 00:23.396
Jazz, your boyfriend?

00:23.496 --> 00:25.317
- I love Jazz.
- And Dad?

00:25.417 --> 00:27.475
I am not gonna be
the messenger between you two.

00:27.575 --> 00:29.155
Carlton started
weaning off the medication,

00:29.255 --> 00:30.434
and we just wanted you
to keep an eye on him.

00:30.534 --> 00:32.193
If C needs my help,
I got his back.

00:32.293 --> 00:33.553
<i>I just keep thinking</i>

00:33.653 --> 00:35.672
that Ms. Hughes got fired
because of me.

00:35.772 --> 00:37.032
Rallying to save
Ms. Hughes' job

00:37.132 --> 00:39.231
is a cause worthy of our BSU.
- I agree.

00:39.331 --> 00:40.231
I think we should protest.

00:40.331 --> 00:41.749
Shut this protest down.

00:41.849 --> 00:42.950
Whoa.
They trying to put us on mute?

00:43.050 --> 00:44.229
<i>They took away the banner,</i>

00:44.330 --> 00:46.428
<i>but you can still
do the speech.</i>

00:46.529 --> 00:47.868
You better not
fucking tell Mum and Dad.

00:47.968 --> 00:49.967
Okay. I got you.

00:51.367 --> 00:53.026
all:
Black teachers matter!

00:53.126 --> 00:55.885
Black teachers matter!
Black teachers matter!

01:06.321 --> 01:08.300
Fuck!

01:08.400 --> 01:11.260
I can't believe I'm getting
suspended for this shit.

01:11.360 --> 01:13.539
No one asked you
to go up on the roof.

01:13.639 --> 01:15.258
Hey, look, you got to
tell your folks what happened.

01:15.359 --> 01:16.618
No.

01:16.718 --> 01:18.337
No, and you can't
say anything either.

01:18.437 --> 01:19.617
You promised me.
- Look.

01:19.717 --> 01:21.216
Carlton,
I'm not doing that, a'ight?

01:21.316 --> 01:23.135
I told Uncle Phil
that I would look out for you.

01:23.235 --> 01:25.135
- Well, good job.
- What's that supposed to mean?

01:25.235 --> 01:27.094
You pushed me.

01:27.194 --> 01:28.814
I didn't want
to do the Blackout.

01:28.914 --> 01:30.771
It was your idea, and
you just wouldn't let it go.

01:30.873 --> 01:32.771
Uh, yeah because I believed
in what we were doing.

01:32.871 --> 01:36.530
Oh, yeah, so much passion for
a teacher you didn't even know.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.530
Will, you can say
that you did it for me

01:38.630 --> 01:40.689
or--or you did it for Ashley
or Ms. Hughes,

01:40.789 --> 01:42.050
but at the end of the day,

01:42.150 --> 01:44.448
the protest wasn't
about any of that, Will.

01:44.548 --> 01:45.887
You went up on that roof
for you.

01:45.987 --> 01:47.047
That's not true, bro.

01:47.146 --> 01:48.406
I was genuinely
looking out for you.

01:48.506 --> 01:50.405
You were so focused
on fucking with authority,

01:50.505 --> 01:52.503
you lost track of the one thing
my dad asked you to do.

01:53.985 --> 01:55.984
Look out for me.

02:04.780 --> 02:06.760
I'm afraid
we don't have great news.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.159
We, uh--

02:08.259 --> 02:10.439
we couldn't appeal
the suspension.

02:10.539 --> 02:12.318
Being on the roof was a--

02:12.418 --> 02:14.357
a huge school safety violation.

02:14.457 --> 02:15.677
How long?

02:15.777 --> 02:18.695
One week,
but that's not all of it.

02:19.736 --> 02:22.435
Coach Johnson's pulling you
from the basketball team.

02:22.535 --> 02:23.913
Indefinitely.
- What?

02:24.014 --> 02:25.393
No, he can't do this.
This is my future.

02:25.493 --> 02:27.432
I'm so sorry, Will.
We tried everything.

02:27.532 --> 02:28.952
Look, we been
bumping heads all season.

02:29.052 --> 02:30.672
He's just using this
as an excuse to get rid of me.

02:30.772 --> 02:33.430
Well, you sure
made it easy for him.

02:33.530 --> 02:35.070
Will, how long you gonna
keep blaming other people

02:35.170 --> 02:36.190
for your actions?

02:40.488 --> 02:42.748
Look, you stood up
for what was right,

02:42.848 --> 02:44.966
but there are consequences.

02:48.886 --> 02:50.885
Is there something else
you want to tell me, Will?

02:53.763 --> 02:55.762
I guess I'll just do my time.

02:58.082 --> 03:00.621
Fuck this school.

03:00.721 --> 03:02.980
Maybe Coach Johnson
just needs some time.

03:03.080 --> 03:04.100
I don't know.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.978
I just feel like
nobody gets me here.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.177
We got you, Will.

03:27.432 --> 03:28.691
<i>♪ It's like déjà vu ♪</i>

03:28.791 --> 03:30.770

03:41.986 --> 03:42.371

03:42.371 --> 03:43.925
No, we cannot up
the RSVP count by 50.

03:44.025 --> 03:46.724
What? The venue we selected
cannot accommodate that.

03:46.824 --> 03:49.363
And yes, it is too late
to find another one.

03:50.463 --> 03:52.961
Uh, yeah, you do that.

03:53.061 --> 03:54.402
I swear, this art show

03:54.502 --> 03:56.201
is getting more complicated
by the hour.

04:01.179 --> 04:02.838
I don't mind having you here.

04:02.938 --> 04:05.077
I really like
having your company,

04:05.177 --> 04:07.277
but headphones would be great.

04:07.377 --> 04:09.996
My bad, Aunt Viv.

04:13.775 --> 04:14.794
Yo, playoffs is
where I was gonna have

04:14.894 --> 04:16.154
all the right eyes on me.

04:16.254 --> 04:18.153
And next year
is my senior year.

04:18.253 --> 04:20.312
It just feels like
my plan is jacked.

04:20.413 --> 04:24.230
Will, my sister
raised you to handle anything

04:24.330 --> 04:25.710
and everything
the world throws at you.

04:25.810 --> 04:27.589
Your basketball career
is not over.

04:27.689 --> 04:30.109
Sure feels like it.

04:30.209 --> 04:32.508
Well,
what about that AAU thing

04:32.608 --> 04:34.187
you were telling me about?
- Zenith Hype?

04:34.287 --> 04:35.186
I mean,
every time I bring it up,

04:35.286 --> 04:36.467
Uncle Phil just shuts it down

04:36.567 --> 04:38.306
or makes another excuse.

04:38.406 --> 04:39.625
You know,
when I came back home,

04:39.725 --> 04:41.664
Uncle Phil said
he would support my dreams,

04:41.764 --> 04:43.223
so when is that gonna happen?

04:43.323 --> 04:44.543
Ah.

04:44.643 --> 04:46.182
Been looking for you.

04:46.282 --> 04:47.662
Gave the housekeeper
the day off,

04:47.762 --> 04:50.181
so I have a list of things
I need you

04:50.281 --> 04:52.221
to do around the house.
- Things?

04:52.321 --> 04:53.519
You think you just gonna
lay around in your underwear

04:53.519 --> 04:55.419
all day?

04:55.519 --> 04:56.699
It's a figure of speech.

04:56.799 --> 04:58.779
He could use a day
to decompress.

04:58.879 --> 05:00.878
Well, he can decompress
on his own time.

05:02.356 --> 05:03.856
Let's go, nephew.

05:10.634 --> 05:12.253
Carlton,

05:12.353 --> 05:14.173
faculty nominations for the
Founder's Award are coming out,

05:14.273 --> 05:16.272
and you know
they can only pick one student.

05:18.511 --> 05:19.890
Wait, me?

05:19.990 --> 05:21.530
Yes.

05:21.630 --> 05:24.649
Your actions the day of the
protest didn't go unnoticed.

05:24.749 --> 05:26.829
I told you
this would be good for you.

05:43.503 --> 05:45.502
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

05:48.941 --> 05:50.519
Need anything else?

05:50.619 --> 05:52.679
Oh, ten more hours
in the day?

05:54.058 --> 05:56.118
- That boss life, huh?
- Yes.

05:56.218 --> 05:58.677
If I can just close
the Simply Spiked deal,

05:58.777 --> 06:00.156
it would be a game changer
for the House.

06:00.256 --> 06:02.556
Then H2Ivy is over with.

06:02.656 --> 06:04.675
- H2Ivy?
- Mm-hmm.

06:04.775 --> 06:06.273
Does Ivy know about this?

06:06.373 --> 06:08.153
She's
on a need-to-know basis.

06:08.253 --> 06:10.073
If she can make moves
without telling me,

06:10.173 --> 06:11.953
then I can do the same.

06:12.053 --> 06:14.032
Now, that sounds like
a healthy partnership.

06:14.132 --> 06:16.390
Shut up.

06:16.490 --> 06:18.111
And I'm sorry
that I can't make lunch today,

06:18.211 --> 06:20.110
but I just need
to finish this pitch.

06:20.210 --> 06:22.588
We could do dinner, though.
- Ah, can't.

06:22.688 --> 06:24.028
Mums and Pops
coming over later.

06:24.128 --> 06:25.587
Got to clean up.
- Okay.

06:25.687 --> 06:27.687
Well, then I could
just meet your parents.

06:31.645 --> 06:33.305
Or not.

06:33.405 --> 06:35.984
I mean, like...

06:36.084 --> 06:37.463
do you think
you ready for that?

06:37.563 --> 06:39.502
Ready for what, Jazz?
Why wouldn't I be ready?

06:39.602 --> 06:40.582
I mean, I just--
I just don't want

06:40.682 --> 06:41.701
to push you
into rushing anything.

06:41.801 --> 06:43.261
But you already
know my parents.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.140
So why can't I meet yours?
What's the big deal?

06:45.240 --> 06:46.420
Right.

06:46.521 --> 06:48.459
No, right.
It's no big deal.

06:48.558 --> 06:49.859
I'm trippin'.
- Are you sure?

06:49.959 --> 06:51.738
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'd love to.

06:51.838 --> 06:53.298
Okay, great.
Then it's a date.

06:53.398 --> 06:56.696
I can't wait to see
what makes Jazz, Jazz.

06:56.796 --> 06:58.855
Bye.
- Bye.

07:26.746 --> 07:28.365

07:28.465 --> 07:29.844
Thought you was ghosting me.

07:29.944 --> 07:31.484
No. No, no, no.

07:31.584 --> 07:34.523
I was, uh, just busy
with school and shit.

07:34.623 --> 07:37.442
Hmm. Heard you was suspended
and kicked off the team.

07:37.542 --> 07:40.041
I guess word travels fast.

07:40.141 --> 07:41.360
Yeah, when you tapped in,

07:41.460 --> 07:43.519
information just has a way
of finding you.

07:43.619 --> 07:45.758
<i>So you still trying
to rock with me or what?</i>

07:45.858 --> 07:47.638
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

07:47.738 --> 07:50.157
I mean, if that's still an
option, I-I would love that.

07:50.257 --> 07:52.556
<i>Tell you what,
since you got some free time,</i>

07:52.656 --> 07:53.876
why don't you swing by later
with your uncle,

07:53.976 --> 07:54.875
and we'll figure it out?

07:54.975 --> 07:57.435
Uh, my uncle. Um...

07:57.534 --> 07:59.674
<i>- That a problem?</i>
- No.

07:59.774 --> 08:02.833
No, it's not.
Um, we'll be there.

08:02.933 --> 08:04.872
Look, Doc, I-I really
appreciate this opportunity.

08:04.972 --> 08:06.071
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

08:06.171 --> 08:07.470
Bet.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.831
Looks like he's coming in.

08:08.931 --> 08:10.630
Thank you, Mr. Hightower.

08:10.730 --> 08:12.729
This means a lot.

08:16.288 --> 08:18.287
Hey, Geoffrey.

08:20.126 --> 08:21.585
Heading out?

08:21.686 --> 08:23.624
Yeah.

08:23.724 --> 08:25.724
Yeah? Where to?

08:27.164 --> 08:29.204
Personal errands.

08:31.123 --> 08:33.102
Was there something you needed?

08:33.202 --> 08:35.262
Uh, no.

08:35.362 --> 08:38.060
No. Enjoy the day.

08:38.160 --> 08:40.159
Thanks.

08:49.036 --> 08:50.095
Yazmin.

08:50.195 --> 08:52.534
It all makes sense now.

08:52.634 --> 08:54.334
All what makes sense?

08:54.434 --> 08:55.894
You said you were gonna
give a speech at the protest,

08:55.994 --> 08:57.694
but then you just stood there.

08:57.794 --> 08:59.132
Bassin got to you,

08:59.232 --> 09:01.092
and now your name's
on the Founder's Award list.

09:01.192 --> 09:02.811
Oh, no.

09:02.911 --> 09:04.650
No, look, I-I--

09:04.750 --> 09:06.730
it's actually a lot
more complicated than that.

09:06.830 --> 09:09.489
It seems pretty simple
to me, Carlton.

09:09.589 --> 09:13.528
I thought we were working
on the same agenda, but...

09:13.628 --> 09:15.087
I guess
you had one of your own.

09:28.462 --> 09:29.442
246

09:30.981 --> 09:32.641
Thanks for letting me
hide out here, Mum.

09:32.741 --> 09:34.599
I can never work
at the Influencer House.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.999
Of course. Any time.

09:37.099 --> 09:39.479
You know
I love seeing you in boss mode.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.837
Are you still enjoying it?

09:40.937 --> 09:42.398
I mean, yeah.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.277
I don't get to do
my cooking videos as much,

09:44.377 --> 09:46.436
but I'm kind of
liking the business side.

09:46.536 --> 09:48.875
Yeah? Ugh, all I want to do
is close the door,

09:48.975 --> 09:50.594
turn on some music,
and paint all day,

09:50.694 --> 09:53.273
but with this art show coming,

09:53.373 --> 09:56.552
there's a million people
with a million opinions.

09:56.652 --> 09:58.631
Well, Mum,
it's gonna be great.

09:58.731 --> 10:00.351
And listen,
if you need any help,

10:00.451 --> 10:02.530
I'll make some time.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.308
Well, what about you?

10:07.408 --> 10:09.507
Are you managing
to have some fun?

10:09.607 --> 10:13.026
I mean, how's it going
with you and Jazz?

10:13.126 --> 10:14.266
We're good.

10:14.366 --> 10:18.364
Um, I'm actually meeting
his parents tonight.

10:19.444 --> 10:20.664
Wow. Wow.

10:20.764 --> 10:23.743
Well, that's--
that's a big step.

10:23.843 --> 10:25.021
And?

10:25.121 --> 10:26.422
- What?
- Mum, come on.

10:26.522 --> 10:28.061
You obviously want
to say something else.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.420
What? No, I like Jazz.

10:29.520 --> 10:32.860
He is independent, mannerable,

10:32.960 --> 10:34.939
uh, he treats you wonderful,

10:35.039 --> 10:37.897
and he's a great role model
for Will, so...

10:37.997 --> 10:40.017
But?

10:40.117 --> 10:42.896
But he--he's just not...

10:42.996 --> 10:46.215
the type of guy
that you traditionally dated.

10:46.315 --> 10:49.892
Mm, like immature
and emotionally unavailable.

10:49.992 --> 10:52.973
The flashy hotshots with
the big cars and the clout.

10:53.073 --> 10:54.852
- Bel-Air boys.
- Exactly.

10:54.952 --> 10:56.690
Yeah, Jazz is different.

10:56.790 --> 11:00.689
But I don't know,
I think that's why I like him.

11:00.789 --> 11:02.768
And maybe it's time
I try something new.

11:02.868 --> 11:05.927
Well, different is good.

11:06.027 --> 11:10.026
And you know what?
His parents are gonna love you.

11:18.463 --> 11:20.522
- Excuse me, Uncle Phil?
- Hey, Will.

11:20.622 --> 11:22.481
How's it going out there?
- Good.

11:22.581 --> 11:26.000
I, um, cleaned the fridge,
washed your car,

11:26.100 --> 11:28.799
even gave your rims
a little extra elbow grease.

11:28.899 --> 11:31.119
Nice. Well done, nephew.

11:31.219 --> 11:33.218
Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

11:48.132 --> 11:50.352
Is there something else
I could help you with?

11:50.452 --> 11:53.191
Oh, yeah,
now that you bring it up...

11:53.290 --> 11:55.510
Um, look,
I know I'm in the doghouse,

11:55.610 --> 11:58.228
but you always say closed
mouths don't get fed, right?

11:58.328 --> 12:02.387
So, uh, I was wondering
if you could do me a favour.

12:02.487 --> 12:04.666
Okay.

12:04.766 --> 12:05.827
What is it?

12:05.927 --> 12:07.786
Um...

12:07.886 --> 12:09.885
do you remember Doc?

12:15.723 --> 12:17.862
Our program is designed
for players

12:17.962 --> 12:20.420
who are dedicated
and committed to being great.

12:20.520 --> 12:21.621
Yeah, that's me all day, Doc.

12:21.721 --> 12:22.939
You'll get strength, movement,

12:23.039 --> 12:24.140
and endurance training,

12:24.240 --> 12:26.778
as well as access
to our top exposure camps

12:26.878 --> 12:28.538
where our players
showcase their skills

12:28.638 --> 12:30.178
in front of hundreds
of college coaches.

12:30.278 --> 12:32.856
See, we don't get none
of that in Bel-Air, Uncle Phil.

12:32.956 --> 12:34.976
So the price
for new players is 10,000

12:35.076 --> 12:36.455
with a monthly fee of 500?

12:36.555 --> 12:38.294
Seems awfully steep
for high school kids.

12:38.394 --> 12:41.294
Well, we do have scholarships
for families who qualify.

12:41.394 --> 12:42.892
Would you like
a financial aid form?

12:44.951 --> 12:47.011
Look, I usually like
to finish the tour

12:47.111 --> 12:48.970
before we talk numbers,
but we can chat

12:49.070 --> 12:50.570
about the particulars now
if you'd like.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.330
- Yes, very much.
- Yeah, let's do it.

12:52.430 --> 12:55.768
Uh, just me and Mr. Hightower
for now, Will.

12:55.868 --> 12:57.487
Yeah, Will,
why don't you go upstairs

12:57.587 --> 12:58.967
and get your fade tightened up?

12:59.067 --> 13:00.685
Fade tightened up?

13:00.786 --> 13:02.286
I don't think it can get
much tighter than this now.

13:04.665 --> 13:06.005
Mr. Banks.

13:11.863 --> 13:13.841
It's crazy
what they brought down on Will.

13:13.941 --> 13:16.721
And half the school is ready
to Million Man March for him.

13:16.821 --> 13:19.380
Yes, I get it.
He's our beloved hero.

13:21.099 --> 13:23.718
So you want to talk
about the protest?

13:25.858 --> 13:28.117
I know people are saying that
I tanked the speech on purpose,

13:28.217 --> 13:29.916
but that's not true, all right?

13:30.016 --> 13:31.595
I had a-a panic attack.

13:31.695 --> 13:32.795
And I know it sounds
like an excuse--

13:32.895 --> 13:34.875
You don't have
to explain yourself to me.

13:34.975 --> 13:36.274
I saw you.

13:36.374 --> 13:38.674
And I know what it looks like, remember?

13:38.774 --> 13:40.773
Hey, Lisa.

13:41.412 --> 13:43.191
You coming
to the BSU hang tonight?

13:43.290 --> 13:44.951
I think we could all stand
to have some fun.

13:45.052 --> 13:47.050
Of course.

13:51.129 --> 13:53.307
Damn, if looks could kill...

13:53.407 --> 13:54.828
Whatever, okay?

13:54.928 --> 13:56.547
I wasn't really feeling her
all that much anyway.

13:56.647 --> 13:58.386
Boy, please.

13:58.486 --> 14:00.185
I know you like her.

14:00.285 --> 14:01.664
Let her in.

14:01.764 --> 14:04.304
Talk about
what you're dealing with.

14:04.404 --> 14:05.903
There's this thing girls love.

14:06.003 --> 14:08.422
What's it called?
Oh, right, communication.

14:08.522 --> 14:10.662
No, okay?

14:10.762 --> 14:13.500
Look, I don't need another girl
feeling sorry for me.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.220
All I'm saying is,
it's okay to be honest

14:16.320 --> 14:18.419
and show people
the real Carlton.

14:18.519 --> 14:19.898
Otherwise,
everyone is just going

14:19.998 --> 14:21.997
to think the worst of you.

14:28.875 --> 14:30.094
Sheesh!

14:30.194 --> 14:32.854
This shit is super crispy, dog.

14:37.871 --> 14:39.690
Enjoying the amenities?

14:39.790 --> 14:41.930
Yo, hey. What's up?

14:42.030 --> 14:43.929
Hey, wait.
What are you doing here?

14:44.029 --> 14:45.370
Part-time gig.

14:45.470 --> 14:48.328
I answer the phones,
wipe down the machines,

14:48.428 --> 14:50.687
earn some extra cash.

14:50.787 --> 14:53.406
I kind of know the boss.
- Oh, right.

14:53.506 --> 14:55.685
Doc is your uncle.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

14:55.785 --> 14:57.765
That was crazy.

14:57.865 --> 15:00.123
So, um, suspended, huh?

15:00.223 --> 15:02.442
Damn. Does everybody know
my business around here?

15:02.543 --> 15:03.563
What'd you do?

15:03.663 --> 15:05.602
I kind of went
a little too hard

15:05.702 --> 15:07.282
for a Black teacher
who got fired.

15:07.382 --> 15:08.680
What?
You shouldn't get punished

15:08.780 --> 15:10.200
for rockin' out
for the culture.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.000
That's what I said.

15:12.100 --> 15:13.680
Appreciate it.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.718
Different rules in Bel-Air,
I guess.

15:15.819 --> 15:17.797
Seems that way.

15:17.897 --> 15:20.077
So Doc tells me
you're from Philly.

15:20.177 --> 15:21.476
- Oh, he does?
- Yeah.

15:21.576 --> 15:22.676
- You been asking about me?
- No.

15:22.776 --> 15:23.836
- You sure?
- Yeah.

15:25.655 --> 15:29.954
So when you gonna give me a
bigger glimpse into your world?

15:30.054 --> 15:32.952
I don't really let
a lot of people in too fast.

15:33.052 --> 15:34.591
Hmm.

15:34.691 --> 15:38.271
Well, uh,
maybe we could change that.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.370
We'll see.

15:49.687 --> 15:51.866
Well, I got to ask.

15:51.966 --> 15:53.304
What's in it for you?

15:53.404 --> 15:55.304
The satisfaction
of helping young athletes

15:55.404 --> 15:56.943
reach their full potential.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.384
Why don't you try
giving me an answer

15:58.484 --> 16:00.862
that's not in the brochure?

16:00.962 --> 16:03.061
I got kids making
upwards of 80 grand

16:03.161 --> 16:05.101
before they even
graduate high school.

16:05.201 --> 16:06.500
I don't make a penny off no one

16:06.600 --> 16:08.460
who ain't making
a whole lot more.

16:08.560 --> 16:10.619
Well, my nephew's
been through a lot,

16:10.719 --> 16:11.939
and I'm just trying to support

16:12.039 --> 16:13.858
what he wants to do
with his life.

16:13.958 --> 16:16.257
I also want to make sure
that he's being exposed

16:16.357 --> 16:18.456
to an experience that's gonna
change him for the better.

16:18.556 --> 16:19.935
Hmm.

16:20.036 --> 16:21.574
What, you disagree?

16:21.674 --> 16:23.334
Man, the world is always
trying to tell our boys

16:23.434 --> 16:26.973
to change who they are
to be great,

16:27.073 --> 16:30.092
but I think it's what they been
through that makes them great.

16:30.192 --> 16:31.531
Hmm.

16:31.631 --> 16:33.531
I don't want to quiet
what's inside Will.

16:33.631 --> 16:35.810
I want to bring it out.
- Right.

16:35.910 --> 16:37.769
You also want him to give you
a percentage of his earnings

16:37.869 --> 16:40.848
from any NIL deals
and all contracts...

16:40.948 --> 16:42.948
in perpetuity?

16:45.706 --> 16:47.925
Look, if these questions
are too difficult for you...

16:48.025 --> 16:49.525
It's not, man.

16:49.625 --> 16:51.164
I'm just not used
to people pressing me

16:51.264 --> 16:52.444
when they seeking my help.

16:52.544 --> 16:54.723
They understand
the value that I bring.

16:54.823 --> 16:56.922
It's something that your wife
clearly understood.

16:57.022 --> 16:58.802
My wife?

16:58.902 --> 16:59.841
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

16:59.942 --> 17:01.240
Hey, Uncle Phil.
Come on, man.

17:01.340 --> 17:02.561
Why we rushin' out of here
like we rob this jawn?

17:02.661 --> 17:03.499
We'll discuss it
when we get home.

17:03.499 --> 17:04.639
Wait. Please, please.

17:04.740 --> 17:06.599
Come on, man.
What's the problem?

17:06.699 --> 17:08.038
Maybe I can fix it.
- We should just keep looking.

17:08.138 --> 17:09.279
All right?
Look, we'll find you a team

17:09.379 --> 17:10.757
that's the right fit,
but this isn't it, okay?

17:10.857 --> 17:13.036
Just like that?

17:13.136 --> 17:14.636
You make a decision,
and I just got to live with it?

17:14.736 --> 17:16.435
Uncle Phil, this is my life
we're talking about.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.995
- Look, Will--
- Look, Doc may not be

17:18.095 --> 17:22.074
Bel-Air enough for you, but
that's exactly why I like him.

17:22.174 --> 17:24.172
And maybe that's exactly
why you don't.

17:26.411 --> 17:28.411
Will.

17:35.489 --> 17:45.154
449

17:45.154 --> 17:46.505
Hey.

17:46.605 --> 17:48.604
Ash, why you tossing
that stuff?

17:50.003 --> 17:51.102
I don't need it.

17:51.202 --> 17:52.902
What? Come on.

17:53.002 --> 17:55.001
This is everything
you believe in.

17:59.879 --> 18:01.899
I just don't know anymore.

18:01.999 --> 18:04.618
Ms. Hughes got fired,
and you got suspended.

18:04.718 --> 18:07.216
You can't even be on the
basketball team because of me.

18:07.316 --> 18:09.655
Ashley...

18:09.756 --> 18:12.615
look, it's not your fault.

18:12.715 --> 18:13.934
Okay?

18:14.034 --> 18:16.033
I made my own decision.

18:20.072 --> 18:21.492
What's the point
in trying to change things

18:21.592 --> 18:23.591
if they just end up like this?

18:34.468 --> 18:36.647
And then you went down there
behind my back?

18:36.747 --> 18:38.125
Why didn't you
talk to me first?

18:38.225 --> 18:40.085
I didn't realise I had
to get your permission.

18:40.185 --> 18:42.564
Oh, it is always
about what you want.

18:42.664 --> 18:45.923
And laying down the law
isn't always the answer.

18:46.023 --> 18:48.162
Will is hurting.

18:48.262 --> 18:50.122
Look, I-I know
you have a soft spot for him,

18:50.222 --> 18:51.841
and--and I love him too,

18:51.941 --> 18:54.120
but he is still
an impulsive teenager

18:54.220 --> 18:56.280
who's clearly been making
the wrong decisions.

18:56.380 --> 18:59.239
But we also have
to listen to what he needs.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.957
I mean, what is so wrong
with this AAU team?

19:02.057 --> 19:03.996
It's not the team
that I'm worried about.

19:04.096 --> 19:07.115
Then what is it
with you and Doc?

19:07.215 --> 19:10.474
This man clearly has
a strong influence over Will,

19:10.574 --> 19:12.194
and I'm not sure
it's one that he needs

19:12.294 --> 19:13.832
when he's at a crossroads
looking for direction.

19:13.932 --> 19:16.912
We cannot control who should
or shouldn't be in Will's life.

19:17.012 --> 19:19.471
We have learned that
the hard way.

19:19.571 --> 19:20.550
Look,
this is different than Lou.

19:20.651 --> 19:22.110
Oh, it feels the same.

19:22.210 --> 19:23.909
And the last thing Will needs

19:24.009 --> 19:26.108
is to feel like
we are playing puppet master

19:26.208 --> 19:27.908
with his future again.

19:28.008 --> 19:29.508
All I'm saying is
that you and I need to be

19:29.608 --> 19:31.547
on the same page
when it comes to Will.

19:31.647 --> 19:33.586
And what you did today
undermines everything

19:33.686 --> 19:35.685
I thought we were trying to do.

19:40.283 --> 19:41.703
What up, C?

19:41.802 --> 19:43.263
Hey.

19:43.363 --> 19:44.982
How'd school go?

19:45.082 --> 19:46.581
Awful.

19:46.681 --> 19:50.220
Yazmin won't even look
in my direction.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.459
How was day one
of being suspended?

19:52.559 --> 19:53.980
Horrible.

19:54.080 --> 19:56.818
Been washing your nasty-ass
Gucci drawers all day.

19:56.918 --> 19:59.197
Those are supposed
to be dry-cleaned.

20:00.637 --> 20:02.295
Thanks, by the way,

20:02.395 --> 20:06.734
for, uh, not throwing me
under the bus with Mum and Dad.

20:06.834 --> 20:09.253
They would've just freaked out
and put me on stronger meds.

20:09.354 --> 20:10.234
Look, man,
why do they always think

20:10.234 --> 20:11.573
they know what's best for us?

20:11.673 --> 20:13.491
Uncle Phil basically
put an end to Zenith.

20:14.791 --> 20:17.170
Look, that sucks.

20:17.270 --> 20:19.270
Yeah.

20:21.349 --> 20:23.328
All right,
enough of the pity party.

20:23.428 --> 20:25.728
Yo, you should come
to this BSU thing with me.

20:25.828 --> 20:26.886
It'll be good
to clear our heads.

20:26.986 --> 20:28.127
Yeah,
they're probably gonna fly

20:28.227 --> 20:30.046
the Blue Angels
across the sky for you,

20:30.146 --> 20:32.644
but my Black card
has been revoked, remember?

20:32.744 --> 20:34.125
Really?
You gonna give up that easy?

20:34.225 --> 20:35.684
Come on, C.

20:35.784 --> 20:38.083
You deserve to be there
as much as anybody else.

20:38.184 --> 20:39.922
And you could talk it out
with Yazmin.

20:40.022 --> 20:42.122
Who knows?
- No, thank you.

20:42.222 --> 20:44.201
I have
a fun Friday night planned.

20:44.301 --> 20:47.320
Gonna be watching a rerun of
the '94 Australian Grand Prix.

20:47.420 --> 20:49.679
Okay. I mean, it's probably

20:49.779 --> 20:52.078
just gonna be some
lame-ass bowling party anyway,

20:52.177 --> 20:54.758
so you not missing much,
you know.

20:54.858 --> 20:56.796
Bowling?

20:56.896 --> 20:59.755
<i>♪ I had to let you know ♪</i>

20:59.855 --> 21:00.915
<i>♪ Shine so bright ♪</i>

21:02.935 --> 21:05.233
This place
is actually fire, though.

21:05.333 --> 21:06.913
What's up, G?

21:07.013 --> 21:09.012
Good to see you, man.
- Hey.

21:10.292 --> 21:12.231
See? I told you
it's gonna be fine, man.

21:12.331 --> 21:14.031
It's not too late
to leave that bag in the car.

21:14.131 --> 21:16.950
House balls and rented shoes?

21:17.050 --> 21:19.049
Those are for rookies, Will.

21:22.047 --> 21:25.226
Carlton, are those flames?

21:25.326 --> 21:27.325
Maybe.

21:36.602 --> 21:39.580
I'm sorry for coming in
so hot earlier.

21:39.680 --> 21:42.741
Yeah,
screaming at each other.

21:42.841 --> 21:45.060
That's not us.

21:45.160 --> 21:48.378
I know, and, uh,

21:48.478 --> 21:51.817
it wasn't all about you.

21:51.917 --> 21:54.156
You okay?

22:02.793 --> 22:04.793
No.

22:05.751 --> 22:09.730
You know, my head's
all messed up right now,

22:09.830 --> 22:12.229
not knowing what's happening
with James at the firm.

22:14.269 --> 22:16.968
And this Doc dude.

22:17.068 --> 22:18.527
And now Geoffrey.

22:18.627 --> 22:22.125
What's going on
with Geoffrey?

22:22.226 --> 22:24.225
I don't know.

22:25.864 --> 22:29.444
He's just a little distant, secretive.

22:29.544 --> 22:31.623
Have you talked to him?

22:34.901 --> 22:36.901
Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.

22:47.257 --> 22:49.896
Things were finally good
between me and Geoffrey.

22:51.616 --> 22:53.795
I just don't want
to question his every move.

22:53.895 --> 22:54.794
Mm.

22:54.894 --> 22:57.113
But I know him.

22:57.213 --> 22:58.993
Something's not right.

22:59.093 --> 23:02.711
Look, I know that you're
going through a lot at the firm

23:02.811 --> 23:05.271
trying to figure out who you
can trust and who you can't,

23:05.371 --> 23:08.869
but not everybody
is against you.

23:20.406 --> 23:23.064
All right, look,
she is amazing, okay?

23:23.164 --> 23:26.023
Just don't go too hard on her,
all right?

23:26.123 --> 23:27.263
Especially you, Mum.

23:27.363 --> 23:29.142
Uh, why especially me?

23:29.242 --> 23:31.221
She's just--
just a little different

23:31.321 --> 23:33.261
than what you're used to,
but just...

23:33.361 --> 23:34.500
Just be cool.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.020
Everybody just be cool.

23:36.120 --> 23:38.019
You seem to be the only one
that's one not cool, son.

23:38.119 --> 23:39.138
Who, me?

23:39.238 --> 23:40.937
Pop, I'm fine. I'm fine.

23:41.037 --> 23:43.457
Just everybody, relax,
all right?

23:43.557 --> 23:45.296
Everybody, relax.

23:45.396 --> 23:47.395
Everything all right?

24:01.590 --> 24:03.609
Uh...

24:03.709 --> 24:05.729
Mum, Dad,

24:05.829 --> 24:09.008
this is, uh--this is Hilary.

24:09.108 --> 24:11.247
As-salamu-alaykum,
Sister Ahmad.

24:11.347 --> 24:13.446
<i>Wa-alakum-as-salaam, Hilary.</i>

24:13.546 --> 24:14.606
You're beautiful.

24:14.706 --> 24:16.965
<i>Shukran.</i>

24:17.065 --> 24:18.485
As-salamu-alaykum,
Brother Ahmad.

24:18.585 --> 24:20.284
<i>Wa-alakum-salaam.</i>

24:20.384 --> 24:21.804
I hope you brought
your appetite.

24:21.904 --> 24:23.762
Please.

24:23.862 --> 24:25.861
Okay.

24:28.502 --> 24:31.101
- She's perfect.
- Thank you.

24:33.060 --> 24:35.060
Thanks, Pop.

24:39.177 --> 24:42.036
It's all about speed,
strength, and angles.

24:42.136 --> 24:43.435
Make sure you don't bend
or flex your wrist

24:43.535 --> 24:44.556
once you release.

24:44.656 --> 24:46.315
Finish
in the handshake position.

24:46.415 --> 24:47.753
- Oh, like this?
- Yeah.

24:47.853 --> 24:49.393
Ah.
- Is it my turn or yours?

24:49.493 --> 24:50.993
Just trying to help.

24:51.093 --> 24:52.993
Uh, also,
it's all in the hip work

24:53.093 --> 24:53.912
and your command of the lane.

24:54.012 --> 24:55.272
Carlton!

24:55.372 --> 24:57.272
I'm a athlete, man.
Back up, a'ight?

24:57.372 --> 24:59.370
I'ma hit 'em.

25:02.449 --> 25:04.308
A'ight, now I see
what I did wrong.

25:04.408 --> 25:05.867
Because of the--the torque,

25:05.967 --> 25:07.147
the way that the jacket was...

25:07.247 --> 25:08.307
It was really good.

25:08.407 --> 25:09.946
A'ight,
you just show me what's up,

25:10.046 --> 25:12.045
and I'll...

25:14.164 --> 25:16.104
- Boom.
- Good. That was pretty good.

What's up?
I didn't see you come in.

25:52.911 --> 25:54.530
- I just got here.
- Oh, yeah?

25:54.630 --> 25:56.609
You missed
my quality bowling skills.

25:56.709 --> 25:58.488
Oh, yeah,
I see you bowled a quality 60.

25:58.588 --> 26:00.668
Hilarious.

26:03.788 --> 26:06.526
Yo, your boy, Drew,
is muggin' me over there.

26:06.626 --> 26:07.725
- What?
- Yeah.

26:07.825 --> 26:10.244
No.
We just drove here together.

26:10.345 --> 26:12.644
I don't know
what you see in him.

26:12.744 --> 26:14.362
That's what a lot
of people said about you.

26:14.462 --> 26:16.842
Me? Who?
I want names.

26:16.943 --> 26:18.002
- How many?
- Like, 15.

26:18.102 --> 26:20.242
Hey, Lisa.
I got you a drink.

26:20.342 --> 26:22.341
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

26:24.619 --> 26:26.619
What's up, king?

26:35.056 --> 26:37.115
Uh, I'ma catch you later, Lisa.

26:37.215 --> 26:38.794
A'ight?
- Mm-hmm.

26:38.894 --> 26:40.893
Doug?
- Drew.

26:41.734 --> 26:43.072
Yo, Carlton,

26:43.172 --> 26:45.312
Yo, I'ma go link up
with Jackie.

26:45.412 --> 26:47.551
You straight?
- Oh, you're leaving?

26:47.651 --> 26:49.550
I mean,
if that's okay with you.

26:49.650 --> 26:51.670
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I don't need a babysitter.

26:51.770 --> 26:52.829
- You sure?
- Yeah.

26:52.929 --> 26:54.429
- Positive?
- Yes.

26:54.529 --> 26:56.468
A'ight.

26:56.568 --> 26:58.906
Yo, Yazmin looks good tonight.
You should go see what's up.

27:00.327 --> 27:02.846
You got this, a'ight?

27:12.843 --> 27:14.422
- Working late again, I see.
- Yeah.

27:14.523 --> 27:17.061
Still getting up to speed
on everything at the firm.

27:20.560 --> 27:22.559
Care to join me for a drink?

27:28.757 --> 27:30.057
Everything okay, Geoffrey?

27:30.157 --> 27:32.055
Yeah.

27:32.155 --> 27:33.535
Why do you ask?

27:33.635 --> 27:36.815
Just making sure
you're happy here, that's all.

27:36.915 --> 27:38.914
I'm just here
to do my job, Phil.

27:42.312 --> 27:45.250
Speaking of which,
it seems your partner, James,

27:45.350 --> 27:47.690
has been having
after-hour meetings at a firm.

27:47.790 --> 27:49.090
I'm not aware
of any meetings.

27:49.190 --> 27:51.189
Exactly.

27:54.388 --> 27:57.087
Hey, Yaz, I was wondering

27:57.187 --> 28:00.565
if we could talk alone,
if you have a sec.

28:00.665 --> 28:02.964
Yeah. Um, maybe later.

28:03.064 --> 28:04.924
I'm just trying
to vibe tonight.

28:05.024 --> 28:06.123
Yeah. Nah, me too.

28:06.223 --> 28:08.223
Um...

28:09.142 --> 28:11.182
I'm up.

28:12.381 --> 28:13.680
- Yas.
- Get it, girl.

28:13.780 --> 28:16.039
Go get that strike.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.798
I think you should just
take the L and move on, bro.

28:19.898 --> 28:21.478
I don't really see how
this is any of your business.

28:21.578 --> 28:23.278
Oh, no, no, no, no,
but it is,

28:23.378 --> 28:25.196
'cause it seem like you
can't stop running your mouth.

28:25.296 --> 28:26.316
But you didn't
have nothing to say

28:26.416 --> 28:27.516
when the shit
really counted, right?

28:27.617 --> 28:28.795
Everyone's having
a good time, Drew.

28:28.895 --> 28:30.035
Just let it be.
- Yeah, yeah.

28:30.135 --> 28:31.514
No, I'm not trying
to stop a good time.

28:31.614 --> 28:33.154
I just--I just think everybody
should know the truth.

28:33.254 --> 28:35.433
Full transparency.
Right, Carlton?

28:37.453 --> 28:38.992
Don't act like
you know me, Drew.

28:39.092 --> 28:40.591
Mm. Well, I know
you came into the BSU

28:40.691 --> 28:41.990
acting like
you wanted to help us.

28:42.090 --> 28:43.631
Really, you just wanted
to help yourself.

28:43.731 --> 28:45.870
But nobody wanted
to listen to me, right?

28:45.970 --> 28:46.909
- Drew, that's enough.
- No, no, no.

28:47.009 --> 28:48.508
Matter of fact,

28:48.608 --> 28:51.487
we should be giving this man
a round of applause.

28:53.646 --> 28:56.585
Hmm? 'Cause all that compromise
on making it a silent protest,

28:56.685 --> 28:58.705
and now,
he's the faculty's nomination

28:58.805 --> 29:00.263
for the Founder's Award.

29:00.363 --> 29:02.423
I-I mean,
it could be a coincidence.

29:02.523 --> 29:04.382
Maybe you had to suck
Mrs. Bassin's dick to get it.

29:05.963 --> 29:07.021
Stop!

29:11.240 --> 29:12.141
Carlton!

29:13.839 --> 29:15.099
- Guys!
- Hey!

29:15.199 --> 29:16.418
Come on! Come on! Come on!
- Come on, man!

29:16.518 --> 29:18.218
Get off him!
- Get the fuck off of me!

29:18.318 --> 29:21.117
Get the fuck off of me!

29:23.596 --> 29:25.615
You motherfuckers
wanna know why I froze?

29:25.715 --> 29:28.693
- Carlton, you don't--
- No.

29:28.793 --> 29:32.093
I had a panic attack.

29:32.193 --> 29:34.692
I have anxiety
and a panic disorder,

29:34.792 --> 29:36.091
and I'm on fucking meds,

29:36.192 --> 29:38.011
so I'm drugged out
all the time,

29:38.111 --> 29:40.010
trying to fit into
this goddamn Bel-Air bubble

29:40.110 --> 29:42.149
without losing my fucking mind.

29:44.269 --> 29:45.927
There.

29:46.028 --> 29:48.027
I said it.
You happy?

29:49.707 --> 29:51.285
Fuck!

29:51.385 --> 29:53.385
Carlton.

29:55.544 --> 29:58.843
So much for creating
a safe space just for us.

29:58.943 --> 30:00.643
We're supposed
to be the BS-fucking-U,

30:00.743 --> 30:01.962
and this is
how we treat each other?

30:10.739 --> 30:11.719
743

32:27.690 --> 32:29.270
Not long enough.

32:29.370 --> 32:31.229
Wow. I didn't, uh--

32:31.329 --> 32:33.268
I didn't know
you were a dancer.

32:33.369 --> 32:35.547
Still got a long way
to get to Juilliard.

32:35.648 --> 32:36.587
Well,
from where I'm standing,

32:36.687 --> 32:39.466
you were... perfect.

32:39.566 --> 32:41.565
Thanks.

32:44.084 --> 32:47.503
So, uh, you work at Zenith
part-time during the day,

32:47.603 --> 32:48.782
and then you come here
and dance at night?

32:48.883 --> 32:51.062
And I get 15 hours
of dance every week.

32:51.162 --> 32:54.061
- Mm.
- While maintaining a 3.8 GPA

32:54.161 --> 32:55.860
and taking three APs.
- Got you.

32:55.960 --> 32:57.820
So what you're saying is
you're an underachiever?

32:57.920 --> 32:59.058
- Kind of.
- That's what I heard.

33:01.398 --> 33:03.217
My uncle always says,

33:03.317 --> 33:06.737
"No grind, no grit,

33:06.837 --> 33:08.575
no greatness."

33:08.675 --> 33:11.455
I like that.

33:11.555 --> 33:12.853
You know, I always say,

33:12.953 --> 33:15.573
work hard, play hard.

33:15.673 --> 33:17.753
- What'd you have in mind?
- You'll see.

33:19.471 --> 33:21.970
Hey, um, you know Saweetie?

33:22.071 --> 33:23.130
Yeah.

33:23.230 --> 33:24.650
You know,
me and her are like this.

33:24.750 --> 33:26.129
Yeah, I doubt that.

33:30.468 --> 33:31.527
You wanna finish that dance?

33:31.627 --> 33:33.126
No.

33:33.227 --> 33:34.526
Whoo!

33:34.626 --> 33:36.206

33:36.306 --> 33:38.445

I had that in me, did you?

33:38.545 --> 33:40.285
Ah. Ah.

33:40.385 --> 33:42.364

So, Mr. Ahmad,

34:26.288 --> 34:28.067
I couldn't help but notice
that your name is Bilal,

34:28.167 --> 34:29.986
which is also the name
of the first Muslim

34:30.086 --> 34:31.546
to recite the call to prayer.

34:31.646 --> 34:33.506
That's right.

34:33.606 --> 34:35.345
Bilal ibn Rabah.
- Mm-hmm.

34:35.445 --> 34:37.465
Yes, he was the son
of an enslaved woman

34:37.565 --> 34:39.704
in the city of Medina
in the seventh century, right?

34:39.804 --> 34:42.182
Uh, that's also right.

34:42.282 --> 34:43.782
- Very impressive.
- Thank you.

34:43.882 --> 34:47.221
Honestly, I am so fascinated
by your religion,

34:47.321 --> 34:49.060
including the observance
of Ramadan,

34:49.160 --> 34:51.459
which is the ninth month
in the Islamic calendar

34:51.559 --> 34:53.539
from 29 to 30 days.

34:53.639 --> 34:55.178
That is correct.

34:55.278 --> 34:57.056
Oh, and I love
the observance of the fast

34:57.156 --> 34:58.696
from sunrise to sunset,

34:58.796 --> 34:59.977
the way
that Muslims connect with God--

35:00.077 --> 35:02.015
Actually, can we just,
uh, change the subject?

35:02.115 --> 35:04.894
- Good idea.
- Absolutely.

35:04.994 --> 35:06.853
So, Mum,
this chicken is fire.

35:06.953 --> 35:08.573
What'd you use?

35:12.032 --> 35:14.690
Ah, James.

35:14.790 --> 35:17.129
Thanks for coming over
at this late hour.

35:17.230 --> 35:20.368
Well, I didn't seem
to have much choice.

35:20.468 --> 35:22.468
Hmm.

35:24.507 --> 35:26.446
You've been busy,

35:26.546 --> 35:28.786
meeting with a lot
of other firms, clients.

35:30.424 --> 35:32.005
You want to tell me
what's going on?

35:32.105 --> 35:34.164
Yeah, I've been having some
confidential strategy meetings,

35:34.264 --> 35:37.283
and, uh, I didn't want to
say anything till I knew more,

35:37.383 --> 35:40.182
but we got
some meaningful offers now.

35:46.020 --> 35:48.019
A merger?

35:48.618 --> 35:49.878
Acquisition.

35:49.978 --> 35:51.837
No.

35:51.937 --> 35:54.077
Absolutely not. No, you--

35:54.177 --> 35:56.595
We did not build this firm
together all these years

35:56.695 --> 35:58.155
to be gobbled up by a big firm

35:58.255 --> 35:59.355
that doesn't care
about us or our people.

35:59.455 --> 36:02.234
Hold on.
You were the rainmaker, Phil.

36:02.334 --> 36:04.752
Right? You brought in
million-dollar clients.

36:04.852 --> 36:07.351
You're the one
everybody wanted to see.

36:07.451 --> 36:10.071
I'm just the day-to-day guy who
made sure the lights stayed on.

36:10.171 --> 36:11.590
I'm the finder,
you're the grinder.

36:11.690 --> 36:12.751
There it is.

36:12.851 --> 36:15.269
And when you left,
we took a hit.

36:15.369 --> 36:18.108
We lost clients.
We lost our best attorneys.

36:18.208 --> 36:20.207
We didn't have another you.

36:22.487 --> 36:23.946
So look,
and--and I get it, okay?

36:24.046 --> 36:25.906
You had bigger ambitions
for your future.

36:26.006 --> 36:27.744
You did what you needed to do.

36:27.844 --> 36:30.163
Don't blame me
when I'm doing the same.

36:31.723 --> 36:32.903
Our partners
will never go for this.

36:33.003 --> 36:34.823
They already have.

36:34.923 --> 36:37.221
I mean, unless you can
pull off a miracle, Phil,

36:37.321 --> 36:39.099
the firm needs this to survive.

36:49.157 --> 36:51.656
895

36:51.756 --> 36:54.295
Wait, Will,
are you making breakfast?

36:54.395 --> 36:55.894
Are you trying
to make me look bad?

36:55.994 --> 36:59.053
Yo, C, I heard you was wylin'
in these streets last night.

36:59.154 --> 37:00.853
Why you wait till
I leave the party to Hulk out?

37:00.953 --> 37:02.852
Look, it wasn't
my proudest moment.

37:02.952 --> 37:05.731
Yo, the BSU chat
is on fire right now.

37:05.831 --> 37:07.930
Said that boy, Drew,
caught a fade.

37:08.030 --> 37:09.649
Said you lumped him up
real good.

37:09.749 --> 37:11.968
Yeah, well, I don't know,
he deserved that shit.

37:12.068 --> 37:13.568
Oh, and you started
a conversation

37:13.668 --> 37:15.208
about Black kids
and mental health.

37:15.308 --> 37:16.888
- Wait, what?
- Yeah, man.

37:16.988 --> 37:19.207
Check this out.

37:19.307 --> 37:21.446
Everybody's dialoguing
about their own shit

37:21.546 --> 37:23.285
and about how you, uh,
put the paws on Drew.

37:25.024 --> 37:28.883
Yo, wait,
de--depression, anxiety,

37:28.983 --> 37:33.760
ADD, ADHD, the fight.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.161
Wait, and look,
the BSU's talking

37:35.261 --> 37:36.800
about starting
mental health workshops.

37:36.900 --> 37:39.240
All because of you, bro?
That's crazy.

37:40.658 --> 37:42.997
A'ight, now beat it.
I'm working on a plot.

37:43.097 --> 37:44.957
Well, what do we have here?

37:46.496 --> 37:48.956
Phil, look at this.

37:49.056 --> 37:51.994
What? Will,
did you cook us breakfast?

37:52.094 --> 37:54.153
Yes, ma'am, I did.

37:54.253 --> 37:55.992
Carlton's
never made breakfast.

37:56.092 --> 37:58.992
On that note,
uh, gonna go study.

37:59.092 --> 38:01.392
Come on.
Let me get you seated.

38:01.492 --> 38:02.630
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

38:02.730 --> 38:05.349
- Mm.
- Come on, sit down.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.589
Cooked some bacon and eggs
for my favourite aunt and uncle.

38:07.689 --> 38:10.428
Got some toast
and some fresh coffee too.

38:10.528 --> 38:12.267
I feel like
we're being buttered up

38:12.367 --> 38:14.266
right along with this toast.

38:14.367 --> 38:17.146
What's on your mind, Will?

38:17.246 --> 38:18.825
Um...

38:18.925 --> 38:21.984
Uncle Phil, I know
you're not feeling Zenith,

38:22.084 --> 38:24.263
but I just feel like
it's the right place for me.

38:24.363 --> 38:25.623
And I promise I'll do the work.

38:25.723 --> 38:28.142
Not only in class,
but I'll get a job,

38:28.242 --> 38:29.461
maybe even two,

38:29.561 --> 38:31.560
just so you don't have
to cover the cost.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.099
I'm impressed.

38:36.119 --> 38:40.058
You know, no grind,
no grit, no greatness, right?

38:40.158 --> 38:43.397
So all you have to say
is one word.

38:49.994 --> 38:51.413
All right.

38:51.513 --> 38:52.773
- A'ight?
- All right.

38:52.873 --> 38:53.772
- Yeah?
- Yes.

38:53.872 --> 38:55.252
Yes!

38:55.352 --> 38:57.411
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, my man.

38:57.511 --> 38:59.970
All right, let's eat.

39:00.070 --> 39:00.910
I'm hungry.
- Hey, hey, wait, wait, wait.

39:00.910 --> 39:02.090
You--you cooked this, right?

39:02.190 --> 39:03.729
- Yeah.
- All right, well, let's pray.

39:03.829 --> 39:05.449
- Oh, amen.
- Yo, he got jokes.

39:58.089 --> 40:00.248

to meet your parents,

40:03.407 --> 40:05.347
you were acting nervous.

but that's only because--

40:16.843 --> 40:18.843
We're so different?

40:20.401 --> 40:23.660

42:51.668 --> 42:54.947
Here's the contract
and the fee.

43:03.903 --> 43:05.442
I see
you took some liberties.

43:05.542 --> 43:06.723
You'll find
you'll still receive

43:06.823 --> 43:08.821
what I consider a generous cut.

43:11.501 --> 43:13.200
He talk you into trying
to strong-arm me?

43:13.300 --> 43:14.560
Nah.

43:14.660 --> 43:16.519
I just asked him
to get the best deal for me.

43:16.619 --> 43:19.038
I figured
you respect the hustle.

43:19.138 --> 43:20.878
Look, Will deserves
a shot at his dreams.

43:20.978 --> 43:22.597
He'll play for your team
and help you win,

43:22.697 --> 43:25.256
but you don't get to own him.

43:29.894 --> 43:32.553
Looks like we got a deal.

43:32.653 --> 43:34.652
All right.

43:35.493 --> 43:36.632
- Coach!
- Yes, sir.

43:36.732 --> 43:39.191
- My man.
- Let's get it.

43:39.291 --> 43:40.790
A'ight.
Hope you ready for me, man.

43:40.890 --> 43:41.789
- Let's do this.
- Let's do it.

43:41.889 --> 43:43.030
I been ready.
- Hey. Yeah.

43:43.130 --> 43:44.068
I been working.

43:44.168 --> 43:45.589
- Get outta here.
- A'ight.

43:45.689 --> 43:47.228
I'ma talk to you later.
- All right, I'll talk to you.

43:47.328 --> 43:48.667
Big Willy's back.

43:55.486 --> 43:56.864
How'd that go?

43:56.964 --> 43:58.504
He's in.

43:58.604 --> 44:00.183
Job well done.

44:00.283 --> 44:02.542
I mean,
I didn't really do anything.

44:02.642 --> 44:03.922
Well, he needed to show
his uncle that he's willing

44:03.922 --> 44:05.901
to work hard
for what he wants.

44:06.001 --> 44:09.260
Thanks to you,
he got there.

44:09.360 --> 44:11.740
No grind,
no grit, no greatness.
