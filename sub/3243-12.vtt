00:00.001 --> 00:04.136
   Joshua: <i> In the beginning,</i>
    <i> a star fell from heaven</i>

00:04.138 --> 00:06.372
        <i> And changed us.</i>

00:06.374 --> 00:10.576
         <i> Made us angels</i>
   <i> and gave us a new destiny:</i>

00:10.578 --> 00:14.313
     <i> To stop the apocalypse</i>
     <i> and the devil himself.</i>

00:14.315 --> 00:17.549
    <i> We must pass god's test</i>

00:17.551 --> 00:21.253
       <i> And prove humanity</i>
     <i> is still worth saving.</i>

00:21.255 --> 00:23.655
   <i> For we are the messengers.</i>

00:27.561 --> 00:29.228
<i>Previously on</i> the messengers...

00:29.230 --> 00:32.464
  We need to find and stop the
four horsemen of the apocalypse.

00:32.466 --> 00:35.034
I once had the same gift you do.

00:35.036 --> 00:36.035
      You're a messenger.

00:36.037 --> 00:37.469
You thinking what i'm thinking?

00:37.471 --> 00:38.470
        Leland schiller

00:38.472 --> 00:40.305
   <i> Is the leader of abaddon.</i>

00:40.307 --> 00:41.407
Aka the horseman of pestilence.

00:41.409 --> 00:44.510
Hey, sweetie,
did you make these?

00:44.512 --> 00:48.647
No. I've never saw them before.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.783
  You daughter's been touched
    with a gift of her own.

00:50.785 --> 00:54.186
      (shouting, cheering)

00:54.188 --> 00:58.057
   She's growing up so fast, and
 you've become quite the mother.

00:58.059 --> 00:59.558
              What do we do now?

00:59.560 --> 01:01.226
        (doorbell rings)

01:01.228 --> 01:02.294
            (gasps)

01:02.296 --> 01:04.129
       (door creaks open)

01:04.131 --> 01:06.732
           Jeff. Kay.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.500
             You can't take him.
                         Please.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.569
  We both know there's nothing
     you can do to stop me.

01:10.571 --> 01:13.372
Um, i've been forgetting things.

01:13.373 --> 01:16.174
   Maybe the memory problems
   are the cost of your gift.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.420
                 Another vision?

01:28.422 --> 01:30.355
         I saw the face
  of someone that can help us.

01:30.357 --> 01:31.423
              Who?

01:32.760 --> 01:34.827
     The seventh messenger.

01:37.164 --> 01:40.799
          Man (on tv):
 In the last two weeks, we have
   all heard about the attack

01:40.801 --> 01:43.535
    On flight 706 that left
     a federal air marshal

01:43.537 --> 01:45.537
In critical condition, and now,

01:45.539 --> 01:48.740
We are learning that the entire
 harrowing ordeal was captured

01:48.742 --> 01:50.642
  On a passenger's cell phone.

01:50.644 --> 01:54.279
Authorities claim zahir zakaria
collapsed on a flight for l.A.,

01:54.281 --> 01:57.282
Only to attack the very marshal
    attempting to save him.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.118
                Sir, sir, i need
                you to remain...

01:59.120 --> 02:00.486
                        (groans)

02:00.488 --> 02:04.723
       (people screaming)

02:04.725 --> 02:06.225
           Anchorman:
   <i> Luckily, the plane managed</i>

02:06.227 --> 02:08.627
       To stay airborne,
     and everyone survived.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.362
   According to high-ranking
       defense department

02:10.364 --> 02:13.298
Officials, zakaria is being held

02:13.300 --> 02:15.234
   At an undisclosed location
        for questioning

02:15.236 --> 02:17.336
   On suspicion of terrorism.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.605
You're sure
this is the same guy?

02:19.607 --> 02:21.473
Yeah. Zahir zakaria.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.609
I saw him in a video
at plowman's office

02:23.611 --> 02:25.677
Reporting on the smart rain
test in mali.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.913
And then i saw him
in my vision... With wings.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.748
        Not to mention,
   he was arrested in houston

02:29.750 --> 02:31.266
       The exact same day
        the meteor hit.

02:31.267 --> 02:32.783
       He was drawn here,
   just like the rest of us.

02:32.786 --> 02:35.487
       If he's messenger,
      we got to find him.
Erin: How are we supposed

02:35.489 --> 02:37.289
           To do that if he's at
        an undisclosed location?

02:37.291 --> 02:38.924
And what if he's not
a messenger?

02:38.926 --> 02:40.926
             I know where he is.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.395
   There's a facility outside
of town, government shadow ops,

02:43.397 --> 02:44.596
     Totally off the books.

02:44.598 --> 02:45.831
          They use it
   for high-level prisoners--

02:45.833 --> 02:47.566
   Cartel bosses, terrorists,
          you name it.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.801
                   My da contact
           tells me that's where

02:49.803 --> 02:52.171
      Zahir is locked up--
    give me the coordinates.

02:52.173 --> 02:54.239
    What are we waiting for?
         Where's peter?

02:54.241 --> 02:55.641
      I'll see if i can get him.
Koa:
Slow down.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.020
   Not sure we want to break

02:57.021 --> 02:58.398
   A terrorist out of prison.
Alleged terrorist.

02:58.399 --> 02:59.776
  He's the seventh messenger,
        and we need him.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.680
          Takes a lot
to get locked up in this place.

03:01.682 --> 03:02.848
     It could be dangerous.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.316
You all saw the video.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.784
This guy almost
took down a plane.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.819
        He wouldn't be the first
         of us to break the law.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.888
Either way, we need to make sure
    this is worth the risk.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.657
     Guys, we can't afford
         to fail again.

03:11.659 --> 03:12.824
          The horsemen
      are working together

03:12.826 --> 03:13.825
    To break the fifth seal.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.260
  We need to be just as united

03:15.262 --> 03:16.495
      If we're gonna stand
     a chance to stop them.

03:16.497 --> 03:18.397
(sighs)
listen to me--

03:18.399 --> 03:19.598
     If <i> revelation's</i> right,

03:19.600 --> 03:20.899
    The fifth seal is worse
      than the first four.

03:20.901 --> 03:22.734
       It begins a period
     of great tribulation.

03:22.736 --> 03:23.936
      Millions could die.

03:23.938 --> 03:25.571
And i'm all
for trying to stop it,

03:25.573 --> 03:26.939
But we already have
a good team going.

03:26.941 --> 03:28.307
Do we really need this guy?

03:28.309 --> 03:29.942
Erin: Yeah, and remember
what eliza said.

03:29.944 --> 03:31.410
   When the seven messengers
      are finally united,

03:31.412 --> 03:32.844
            The cost
   of our gifts will vanish.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.780
   She's right. We have to be
    at our strongest to win.

03:34.782 --> 03:36.949
Let's do it.

03:36.951 --> 03:38.917
            Where is this shadow
           ops facility, anyway?

03:47.861 --> 03:49.328
      (voices whispering)

03:49.330 --> 03:50.896
        (deep rumbling)

04:04.311 --> 04:06.912
           (echoing):
     Who is like the beast,

04:06.914 --> 04:10.716
 And who can fight against it?

04:11.485 --> 04:13.552
                           Vera:
                    What was it?

04:13.554 --> 04:14.987
          Did you see something
               about zahir?

04:15.956 --> 04:18.357
       Or the fifth seal?
No.

04:18.358 --> 04:21.326
  I saw an old tombstone with
  the name christopher dayton.

04:21.327 --> 04:22.961
Died in 1945.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.030
And then,
a nuclear bomb went off.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.999
         And then what?

04:29.003 --> 04:32.004
 I think i saw the antichrist.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.815
       The antichrist is
        a false prophet.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.585
         A human leader who will
     bring death and destruction

04:46.587 --> 04:48.687
                   To the earth,
        like we have never seen.

04:51.892 --> 04:56.628
Like christ is to god, so is
the antichrist to the devil.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.046
    And you think the woman

04:58.047 --> 04:59.463
   With the upside-down face
       is the antichrist?

04:59.466 --> 05:01.566
   She looked at me and said,
    "who is like the beast,

05:01.568 --> 05:03.402
 And who can fight against it?"

05:03.404 --> 05:04.670
      What does that mean?

05:04.672 --> 05:06.738
     It's from <i> revelation.</i>

05:06.740 --> 05:08.373
          Chapter 13.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.542
  The beast is the antichrist,
             and...

05:10.544 --> 05:13.545
  Maybe we're the ones who are
 supposed to fight against it.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.480
     Does it have something
    to do with the horsemen?

05:15.482 --> 05:19.384
I don't know.

05:19.386 --> 05:20.919
        I think this is
      a whole new problem.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.456
    I just found something.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.724
  There's a christopher dayton

05:25.726 --> 05:26.958
     Who matches the dates
        from your vision

05:26.960 --> 05:28.827
Buried in grey forest cemetery.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.829
      That's where i died.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.597
             And where the devil
       brought you back to life.

05:32.599 --> 05:33.966
                           Vera:
          So, what should we do?

05:33.967 --> 05:35.334
  I mean, should we split up?
          I feel like

05:35.335 --> 05:36.702
  Your visions are pulling us
  in two different directions.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.804
I'll go check out the cemetery.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.372
     If you guys can handle

05:40.374 --> 05:41.673
 Finding the seventh messenger
          without me.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.041
Yeah, we got a shape shifter,
a spirit walker,

05:43.043 --> 05:44.843
And the world's strongest
teenager-- i think we got it.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.978
     I'll catch up with you
       as soon as i can.

05:50.884 --> 05:51.950
         (door closes)

06:00.094 --> 06:02.361
         Are you okay?
                           Yeah.

06:02.363 --> 06:03.929
     I just didn't mention
  the other thing eliza said.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.764
    What's that?

06:05.766 --> 06:08.700
   That most of us would die
  trying to stop the horsemen.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.769
That's what happened last time.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.104
       Nobody has to die.

06:12.106 --> 06:14.106
   Look, i've been thinking.

06:14.108 --> 06:15.941
     Amy really loves you,

06:15.943 --> 06:17.876
        And she looks up
  to nadia like a big sister,

06:17.878 --> 06:19.778
So, if anything happens to me...

06:19.780 --> 06:22.147
      Nothing like that's
         gonna happen.

06:22.149 --> 06:25.851
       She can't go back
      to her father, raul.

06:25.853 --> 06:29.154
        Okay. I promise.

06:30.958 --> 06:33.125
 Have you spoken to nadia yet?

06:33.127 --> 06:36.628
   No. I, um, haven't really
had the chance to speak to her.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.864
       Besides, right now
     is not the best time.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.150
    We've got to get going.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.435
      She deserves to know
  you're her father... Today,

06:43.437 --> 06:45.904
   While you're still around
          to tell her.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.813
I missed you.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.882
              I missed you, too.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.751
                    (door opens)
                   hey, nadia...

06:59.753 --> 07:01.720
Whoa!
                    What the...?

07:01.722 --> 07:03.755
     Ever hear of privacy, dude?

07:03.757 --> 07:05.991
                Wait.
      This is where you've been?

07:06.894 --> 07:08.627
         What the hell
       are you thinking?

07:08.629 --> 07:10.129
      We were just, uh...

07:10.130 --> 07:11.630
     No, no. You just stay
  away from her, you hear me?

07:11.632 --> 07:13.031
  Whoa. That's not your call.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.434
               He's a messenger.

07:15.436 --> 07:16.635
 If you get involved with him,

07:16.637 --> 07:17.936
        You might end up
      in the line of fire.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.805
        He's not the one
     who got my dad killed.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.907
  You need to watch yourself.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.644
           And you--

07:25.646 --> 07:27.946
              Have you forgotten
                      something?

07:27.948 --> 07:30.015
   I can hear your thoughts.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.055
            (sighs)

07:37.057 --> 07:39.758
Did you find
the shadow ops facility?

07:39.760 --> 07:42.093
 It's definitely not showing up
        on normal maps.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.729
   Pulled up the coordinates
     and a satellite view.

07:44.731 --> 07:46.064
Hey, what's with the tattoo?

07:46.066 --> 07:48.900
   It's an i ching hexagram.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.502
  Means "force of the small."

07:51.638 --> 07:52.904
 My dad used to draw it for me

07:52.906 --> 07:54.639
   To remind me to be brave.

07:54.641 --> 07:55.841
      Did you just get it?

07:55.843 --> 07:57.843
          Last night.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.245
   Yours isn't the only gift
    that comes with a cost.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.815
  I've been forgetting things,

08:03.817 --> 08:06.952
     So i did some research
        on memory loss.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.553
           Turns out
  some people use visual icons

08:08.555 --> 08:10.989
    To trigger their memory.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.558
Got this to remind me who i am.

08:13.560 --> 08:16.094
     It's gotten that bad?

08:16.096 --> 08:19.798
      I shouldn't feel bad
          for myself.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.535
   If you heal someone again,
         you might die.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.906
    Well, even if we defeat
         the horsemen,

08:27.908 --> 08:29.774
      There's no guarantee
      that we'll survive.

08:53.967 --> 08:54.966
    Eliza.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.635
                    Joshua.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.703
What are you doing here?

08:58.705 --> 09:02.073
     Christopher was our healer.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.975
                    He saved me.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.044
                 More than once.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.619
                 What about you?

09:14.621 --> 09:17.122
I was drawn here
by a vision.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.124
         To this grave.
Yeah.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.659
     It was in the desert,

09:20.661 --> 09:23.862
    And there was some sort
         of bomb blast.

09:23.864 --> 09:24.930
            Trinity.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.099
  The trinity atomic bomb test

09:28.101 --> 09:30.268
      Was our fifth seal,

09:30.270 --> 09:32.671
         70 years ago.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.874
       Your seeing it...

09:35.876 --> 09:37.776
           Could mean
     the horsemen are about

09:37.778 --> 09:40.812
 To break the fifth seal again.

09:40.814 --> 09:43.682
      But if that's true,
     why-why are you here?

09:43.684 --> 09:45.584
        You had visions,

09:45.586 --> 09:46.818
        Just like i do.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.019
   Maybe that's why i'm here.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.655
     What else did you see?

09:50.657 --> 09:53.925
         I saw a woman.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.727
       Her face inverted.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.963
She looked at me
and said,

09:57.965 --> 09:59.097
"who is like the beast

09:59.099 --> 10:01.232
 And who can fight against it?"

10:01.234 --> 10:03.301
        The antichrist.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.340
        Christopher said
      this day might come.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.244
  I really hoped he was wrong.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.081
       What does it mean?

10:16.083 --> 10:19.684
It means everything has changed.

10:19.686 --> 10:21.686
             Vera:
           <i> Whoa, uh,</i>

10:21.688 --> 10:23.254
       That's definitely
   in the middle of nowhere.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.106
                   So how are we
                  gonna do this?

10:25.107 --> 10:26.957
     I can spirit walk in,
    get the lay of the land.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.061
   Means we got to get close.
   That's not gonna be easy.

10:30.063 --> 10:33.198
 So we stake out the facility.
  Wait for somebody to leave.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.265
            Then...

10:34.267 --> 10:36.368
       Then i do a little
        shape-shifting.

10:36.370 --> 10:38.003
      You sure about that?

10:39.272 --> 10:42.841
         I'm just doing
      what has to be done.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.755
           Forgetting something?

10:58.125 --> 10:59.257
             Am i?

10:59.259 --> 11:01.259
Supposed to bring me a burrito.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.361
           From the gas station.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.130
     Sorry. They were out.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.856
         Who would eat
     a gas station burrito,

11:31.858 --> 11:33.391
                         Anyway?

11:33.393 --> 11:35.093
            I would.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.327
        Okay, you're up.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.900
See you
in six minutes.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.998
        (groaning)

12:20.006 --> 12:21.940
                Lunchtime,
                   huh?

12:21.942 --> 12:23.241
                You hear what he
                  did to trotti?

12:23.243 --> 12:25.043
          Don't know.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.811
      Don't want to know.

12:26.813 --> 12:29.214
         (door closes)

12:51.104 --> 12:53.238
       Get away from me!

12:53.240 --> 12:55.306
          All of you!

13:01.281 --> 13:03.281
            (gasps)

13:04.518 --> 13:07.252
    This is gonna be harder
        than we thought.

13:16.263 --> 13:19.063
  There's maybe a dozen armed
   guards in the whole place.

13:19.065 --> 13:20.999
We can handle that.

13:21.001 --> 13:23.501
Koa morphs into
action figure agent.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.103
Gets in, grabs zahir, gets out.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.237
           Just like we planned.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.806
        And we're backup
       if things go bad.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.841
                That's just it--
  the guards aren't the problem.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.376
              I can tell you how
                to get to zahir.

13:31.378 --> 13:34.279
 But i'm not sure, once you get
 there, he's gonna play along.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.214
       What do you mean?
                    I don't know

13:36.216 --> 13:38.216
    If it's 'cause he's been
    tortured and locked up,

13:38.218 --> 13:40.518
       But the guy seems
        pretty unhinged.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.586
            How so?

13:41.588 --> 13:42.987
   The guards are afraid of him.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.589
       Even in a straightjacket.

13:44.590 --> 13:46.190
             It's like they have
       hannibal lecter in there.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.226
    Koa's gonna need backup?

13:48.228 --> 13:49.127
       I'll go with her.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.395
     What are you gonna do?

13:50.397 --> 13:53.131
      Just walk right in?

13:53.133 --> 13:54.499
Exactly.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.369
         (door closes)

13:58.371 --> 14:00.305
                       Who's he?
Another drug war dirt bag.

14:00.307 --> 14:01.239
Go figure.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.376
                        (grunts)

14:09.316 --> 14:11.416
          You all hide in there.

14:11.418 --> 14:12.851
             We're going deeper.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.619
Just try to hurry.
Someone might miss this guy.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.054
            We need to hide him.

14:16.056 --> 14:18.256
        Come on, give me a hand.

14:24.965 --> 14:28.299
Turn left at the...

14:28.301 --> 14:30.001
Where?

14:30.003 --> 14:31.402
                       You okay?

14:34.174 --> 14:35.340
      What are you doing?
         Are you crazy?

14:35.342 --> 14:36.341
   Somebody's gonna see you!

14:36.343 --> 14:38.009
      (speaking mandarin)

14:38.011 --> 14:40.078
         Take it easy.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.381
     Just uncuff me, okay?

14:45.485 --> 14:47.485
          Okay! Okay!
           (shushes)

14:47.487 --> 14:49.587
   Just... You have the key.

14:50.323 --> 14:53.391
Uncuff me.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.193
Koa!
            Hold it right there.
             Freeze!

14:55.195 --> 14:57.128
         Keep your hands up!

14:57.130 --> 14:59.564
(lock beeps, latch thuds)
don't move!

15:02.002 --> 15:04.135
Don't move.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.310
          What you doing, kiddo?

15:12.312 --> 15:14.946
Sharpening crayons.

15:14.948 --> 15:18.616
  Want to go grab some ice cream
         while everybody's away?

15:18.618 --> 15:20.418
            Maybe watch a movie?

15:20.420 --> 15:23.187
No, thanks.

15:23.189 --> 15:25.290
Do we have any more paper?

15:25.292 --> 15:26.324
               I don't think so.

15:26.326 --> 15:28.359
                But we could get
              some at the store.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.395
          No, thanks.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.366
               You don't want to
                do anything fun?

15:35.368 --> 15:38.136
   I am doing something fun.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.070
          I'm drawing.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.243
             I don't understand.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.245
      The devil said he's trying
           to stop the horsemen.

15:47.247 --> 15:48.379
               Is that not true?

15:48.381 --> 15:50.114
He wants to stop the apocalypse.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.684
  But only so he can continue
      to torment mankind.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.521
 As dangerous as the devil is,

15:56.523 --> 15:58.957
         He's limited.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.292
         He can't kill.

16:01.294 --> 16:05.296
    He can only tempt others
          to do wrong.

16:05.298 --> 16:09.033
     But the antichrist is
       his human protégé.

16:09.035 --> 16:12.136
       The antichrist can
      do things he can't.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.405
So, what are we supposed to do?

16:14.407 --> 16:17.141
Stop the horsemen or the devil?

16:19.179 --> 16:22.213
                     Both.

16:24.050 --> 16:26.351
             No.

16:26.353 --> 16:27.585
                   No!

16:27.587 --> 16:28.753
                   Who took it?!

16:28.755 --> 16:30.621
Took what?

16:30.623 --> 16:34.158
             My book full of all
        the messengers' secrets!

17:04.324 --> 17:06.324
          Vera: What do you mean
    you haven't seen them again?

17:06.326 --> 17:08.192
             They were just here
                and now... Gone.

17:08.194 --> 17:11.029
Wherever they are,
they aren't on cameras.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.163
                  They should've
              checked in by now.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.364
     What's taking them so long?

17:13.366 --> 17:15.633
       Give me a minute.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.815
          What is with
      this bondage jacket?

17:35.455 --> 17:38.156
          Who are you?

17:38.158 --> 17:40.825
        You can see me?

17:40.827 --> 17:43.694
         And hear you.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.130
        You have wings.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.669
 Listen, i-i-i'm a human, okay?

17:51.671 --> 17:53.304
I just have
this ability, a gift

17:53.306 --> 17:55.506
     That allows my spirit
       to leave my body.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.408
       I'm hallucinating.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.377
         I-i'm an angel
       of the apocalypse.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.312
    Or they've drugged me--
        that must be it.

18:01.314 --> 18:02.480
            (grunts)

18:02.482 --> 18:04.315
Listen, i know
it's hard to understand...

18:04.317 --> 18:06.451
       I'm never getting
       out of here alive.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.152
     Please, listen to me.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.722
     A couple of weeks ago,
  when you were on your plane,

18:11.724 --> 18:14.392
   A wave of energy hit you,
         and you died.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.294
    And when you came back,
     you were given a gift.

18:16.296 --> 18:17.762
   Does that sound familiar?

18:17.764 --> 18:20.198
                   Yes.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.433
      But how do you know?

18:22.435 --> 18:24.635
   Because you're not alone.

18:24.637 --> 18:28.372
There are others just like you.

18:28.374 --> 18:29.774
  We're called the messengers

18:29.776 --> 18:32.410
 And we're here to get you out.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.645
       (gasping quietly)

18:40.787 --> 18:42.520
       (knocking on door)

18:42.522 --> 18:45.289
Houston police!
Is anybody home?

19:01.441 --> 19:03.441
          You don't belong here.

19:03.443 --> 19:06.210
       This house is foreclosed.

19:06.212 --> 19:07.612
The door was unlocked.

19:07.614 --> 19:10.781
      We've been getting reports
       of squatters living here.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.783
     Several adults and a child.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.385
       Know anything about that?

19:14.387 --> 19:15.453
It's just me.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.922
I haven't seen anyone else.

19:17.924 --> 19:20.191
                  Okay.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.469
        Who drew these?

19:31.471 --> 19:35.573
  They look like were drawn by
someone a lot younger than you.

19:35.575 --> 19:36.607
            (laughs)
        what can i say?

19:36.609 --> 19:38.342
  I'm not a very good artist.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.284
       Tell me the truth.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.252
        Who drew these?

19:48.254 --> 19:49.654
      Are there any more?

19:51.791 --> 19:53.958
               Where's your car?

19:53.960 --> 19:56.194
   Patrolling on foot today.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.428
        What's your name
       and badge number?

19:57.430 --> 19:59.830
      I'm the one who asks
         the questions.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.667
          I know cops.

20:02.669 --> 20:05.469
       You're not a cop.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.538
          (wry laugh)

20:13.980 --> 20:17.615
       Then you're really
    in trouble, aren't you?

20:21.487 --> 20:23.454
   Do you think raul's right?

20:24.724 --> 20:26.724
Should i stay away
from nadia?

20:26.726 --> 20:28.492
           Peter, i don't really
      think this is the right...

20:28.494 --> 20:30.561
    I'm serious.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.532
    I really care
      about her.

20:34.534 --> 20:37.602
And even if she's safe,

20:37.604 --> 20:39.737
       I'm not.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.272
Anything can happen.

20:41.274 --> 20:43.507
That's not fair
to her, is it?

20:43.509 --> 20:45.843
       Let me ask you something.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.878
             What is it that you
               like about nadia?

20:49.382 --> 20:50.381
She's really pretty.

20:50.383 --> 20:51.382
                           Yeah.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.517
And super-smart.

20:53.519 --> 20:55.019
  And...

20:55.021 --> 20:57.855
She kind of scares me
a little.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.924
But it's a good kind
of scared.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.662
I know she seems tough,

21:04.664 --> 21:06.631
But that's all
on the outside.

21:09.636 --> 21:12.637
She really notices things.

21:12.639 --> 21:15.640
Like when i'm sad.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.575
She just knows what to do.

21:19.545 --> 21:21.746
I feel like she's always
gonna be there for me.

21:24.017 --> 21:25.750
I don't know--
i'm being stupid.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.618
                 No, you're not.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.453
                    You're not.

21:29.455 --> 21:30.955
           You really like her,
                don't you?

21:32.458 --> 21:33.591
        Yeah.

21:33.593 --> 21:36.594
              Okay, well, what i
             think you should do

21:36.596 --> 21:38.629
       Is make up your own mind.

21:38.631 --> 21:41.632
                 Just don't tell
                 raul i said so.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.634
           Vera better hurry up.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.972
     Zahir: I was on my way
        to los angeles.

21:49.609 --> 21:53.511
   I felt like i was finally
  closing in on the plowmans.

21:56.349 --> 21:58.549
       <i> But then i sensed</i>
        <i> something wrong.</i>

22:13.566 --> 22:14.899
              Sir?

22:14.901 --> 22:16.500
Oh, my god.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.837
He's got no pulse.

22:19.839 --> 22:22.573
               Is there a doctor
                   on the plane?

22:22.575 --> 22:23.908
Man:
I'm a sky marshal.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.643
              I know cpr.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.717
          <i> I don't know</i>
      <i> what happened then,</i>

22:32.719 --> 22:35.052
 <i> But i was panicked and scared,</i>

22:35.054 --> 22:37.388
  <i> And when i suddenly came to,</i>

22:37.390 --> 22:40.725
      <i> It seemed like i was</i>
 <i> being attacked by a stranger.</i>

22:40.727 --> 22:42.593
   <i> Then i felt a power surge</i>
         <i> from my body.</i>

22:42.595 --> 22:44.595
  Sir, i need you to remain...

22:44.597 --> 22:45.696
        (people scream)

22:52.638 --> 22:56.006
    They grounded the flight
          in houston,

22:56.008 --> 22:58.008
                 Then took me in
                for questioning.

22:58.010 --> 23:00.745
    I couldn't explain anything,
          but they had no proof.

23:00.747 --> 23:03.814
       My lawyer believed
      i would be released.

23:03.816 --> 23:06.150
        Then orders from
the defense department arrived,

23:06.152 --> 23:08.386
         And i ended up
       in this hell hole.

23:08.388 --> 23:10.821
 Defense secretary richards has
to be the one who's behind this.

23:10.823 --> 23:13.524
   You believe i'm innocent?

23:13.526 --> 23:14.959
           Yes, i do.

23:14.961 --> 23:18.629
  I'm an outspoken journalist,
     and a muslim at that.

23:18.631 --> 23:21.632
  Most people find it easy to
 conclude that i'm a terrorist.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.100
      I'm not most people.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.669
Look, i have to,
have to go.

23:25.671 --> 23:27.104
I have to get back
to my body, okay?

23:27.106 --> 23:29.039
Y-you're just going to leave me?

23:29.041 --> 23:30.808
No, we're gonna come back
for you-- i promise.

23:30.810 --> 23:31.842
               No, please.

23:31.844 --> 23:32.843
                Don't go.

23:32.845 --> 23:35.045
               I need your help.

23:46.426 --> 23:48.592
Hey, buddy.

23:48.594 --> 23:50.761
Want to tell us
where they took our friends?

23:52.532 --> 23:55.499
                        (groans)

23:59.939 --> 24:01.172
We ran your prints.

24:01.174 --> 24:03.441
       And we got a hit.

24:04.644 --> 24:06.844
Not what we expected.

24:06.846 --> 24:08.913
Raul garcia.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.817
    A dea agent.

24:12.819 --> 24:15.152
Just recently cleared
of what?

24:15.154 --> 24:17.555
Of killing
two federal officers?

24:17.557 --> 24:19.523
So tell me this...

24:21.160 --> 24:23.227
Why the hell
are you here?

24:25.164 --> 24:26.931
And while you're at it,

24:26.933 --> 24:29.033
Who's the asian chick?

24:31.003 --> 24:33.571
            You're not gonna get
             anything out of me.

24:47.687 --> 24:49.487
              They got koa, too.

24:49.489 --> 24:50.821
                  But she has no
                idea who she is.

24:54.494 --> 24:57.962
     How are we supposed to know
          who the antichrist is?

24:57.964 --> 24:59.263
Your vision was
of a woman.

24:59.265 --> 25:00.798
Might mean
the antichrist is female.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.132
              Half the people in
            the world are women.

25:02.134 --> 25:03.267
               How am i supposed
                    to find her?

25:03.269 --> 25:04.869
Read the scripture.

25:04.871 --> 25:06.871
The antichrist will lead you
to the lake of fire.

25:06.873 --> 25:08.973
                   Just stop.

25:11.043 --> 25:13.110
                 You make it all
                  sound so easy.

25:16.048 --> 25:18.682
          But i'm afraid, eliza.

25:20.653 --> 25:24.154
               The devil brought
                me back to life.

25:24.156 --> 25:27.024
         And now he says that he
       owns the fate of my soul.

25:28.561 --> 25:29.760
        Joshua...

25:31.998 --> 25:35.032
...Your choices are
still your own.

25:36.002 --> 25:38.068
         (phone chimes)

25:41.607 --> 25:43.807
               I have to go.

25:46.012 --> 25:50.180
If you want to save the world
from the devil's dominion,

25:50.182 --> 25:53.851
You must kill
the antichrist.

26:01.561 --> 26:03.227
        Koa, thank god.

26:04.864 --> 26:05.963
                Ooh.

26:05.965 --> 26:07.064
                        It's us.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.567
      (speaking mandarin)

26:09.569 --> 26:11.235
    Koa, you speak english.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.636
 You can understand us, right?

26:15.007 --> 26:17.007
       What do you want?

26:17.009 --> 26:18.642
   We're here to rescue you.

26:18.644 --> 26:19.944
       Come on, let's go.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.113
             Koa...

26:23.115 --> 26:24.615
        We don't have much time.

26:24.617 --> 26:26.850
Just look at the tattoo.

26:26.852 --> 26:28.586
On your wrist.

26:33.693 --> 26:37.161
 Your father used to draw that
       for you, remember?

26:44.737 --> 26:46.036
        Be brave.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.037
                           Yeah.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.105
               That's right.

26:51.677 --> 26:53.143
         (lock buzzes)

26:53.145 --> 26:55.145
     Told you i'd be back.

26:55.147 --> 26:57.214
My god, you're real.

27:02.655 --> 27:04.655
           Thank you.

27:04.657 --> 27:06.957
You're one of us now.

27:14.700 --> 27:17.034
              Those are the last
                of the drawings.

27:17.036 --> 27:19.103
             You can take them--
                   i don't care.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.871
 I'm waiting for your friends.

27:20.873 --> 27:23.273
           Nobody's coming here,
          so you should just go.

27:23.275 --> 27:24.842
          (door opens)

27:24.844 --> 27:26.844
             Nadia.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.746
             Get out.
No.

27:28.748 --> 27:30.881
 Have you forgotten the reason
      you're still alive?

27:30.883 --> 27:32.383
       I don't owe you anything.

27:32.385 --> 27:34.652
     You may not owe me...

27:35.721 --> 27:37.688
...But i <i> own</i> you.

27:38.891 --> 27:40.891
And i need you to think
about what will happen

27:40.893 --> 27:43.027
To your immortal soul
if you dare cross me.

27:43.029 --> 27:46.030
      I'll do whatever it takes.

27:46.032 --> 27:49.700
              And let our father
              sort out the rest.

27:49.702 --> 27:50.834
    (sighs)

27:50.836 --> 27:51.835
                            Amy:
                         Joshua?

27:54.740 --> 27:57.741
    Want to see my drawing?

28:08.754 --> 28:10.954
          What the hell is that?

28:13.793 --> 28:16.326
    That's the lake of fire.

28:16.328 --> 28:21.298
   (eerie voices whispering)

28:21.300 --> 28:23.300
          Oh, my god.

28:23.302 --> 28:25.369
 God has nothing to do with it.

28:34.013 --> 28:35.913
        (alarm blaring)

28:35.915 --> 28:37.114
              Man:
    Lock down the perimeter!

28:41.253 --> 28:42.820
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

28:42.822 --> 28:43.987
                   How do we get
                      past that?

28:43.989 --> 28:45.389
                     I got this.

28:48.094 --> 28:50.060
        Peter, get back!

29:02.208 --> 29:03.941
    That's it, get it open!

29:03.943 --> 29:06.410
                  Open the gate!

29:22.094 --> 29:24.161
     Zahir: I'll stop them
        from chasing us.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.865
  Come on!

29:30.936 --> 29:32.069
         (men shouting)

29:44.917 --> 29:46.950
       This is bad, guys.
       We got to get him
        to the hospital.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.185
    That's a long way away.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.922
               Can you heal him?

29:51.924 --> 29:54.057
         Please, don't.

29:54.059 --> 29:55.425
             Stop.

29:55.427 --> 29:57.161
I can't let you die.

30:04.103 --> 30:06.170
           (gasping)

30:09.275 --> 30:10.274
            Are you all right?

30:10.276 --> 30:11.975
Erin:
I'm not sure.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.977
                     I think so.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.348
      It's gonna be okay.

30:20.152 --> 30:21.385
        How do you know?

30:23.155 --> 30:26.023
I can remember my father's face.

30:26.025 --> 30:28.258
        Eliza was right.

30:28.260 --> 30:29.927
       Now that we've got
     the seventh messenger,

30:29.929 --> 30:31.461
    We're all gonna be okay.

30:35.868 --> 30:38.535
       (blender whirring)

30:44.476 --> 30:47.010
        (blender stops)

30:47.012 --> 30:48.412
     So all you have to do
      is touch something?

30:48.414 --> 30:50.013
                          Zahir:
                         Mm-hmm.

30:50.015 --> 30:53.383
        And i can either
    drain energy from it...

30:53.385 --> 30:55.219
    Or transfer power to it.

30:55.221 --> 30:57.054
        Maybe that's why
    you could see my spirit,

30:57.056 --> 31:00.023
    'cause it's some kind of
     electromagnetic field.

31:00.025 --> 31:02.092
  This whole thing is just...

31:02.094 --> 31:03.927
         Unbelievable.

31:03.929 --> 31:06.063
           Trust me,
  i used to feel the same way.

31:06.065 --> 31:07.431
Thanks.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.442
                Honey...

31:19.945 --> 31:21.345
     Why did you draw that?

31:23.082 --> 31:25.082
     I already told joshua.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.984
       I don't remember.

31:38.097 --> 31:40.130
            So eliza didn't tell
           you anything helpful?

31:40.132 --> 31:42.065
  She just said the antichrist
          is out there

31:42.067 --> 31:44.101
      And we have to stop
         whoever it is.

31:44.103 --> 31:46.603
       Well, do you think
     the devil coming here

31:46.605 --> 31:48.338
      Has something to do
       with the drawing?

31:50.075 --> 31:51.575
              I...

31:51.577 --> 31:53.644
         I don't know.

31:57.149 --> 31:59.116
             Erin:
      <i> Joshua, i feel like</i>

31:59.118 --> 32:00.684
       <i> There's something</i>
     <i> you're not telling me.</i>

32:00.686 --> 32:03.153
            Joshua:
           <i> I'm sorry.</i>

32:03.155 --> 32:05.222
 <i> I just don't know what to say.</i>

32:13.232 --> 32:15.299
        (fire crackling)

32:26.679 --> 32:27.945
Joshua:
What you looking at?

32:27.947 --> 32:30.180
                   Meet jeff and
                   kay fairburn.

32:32.451 --> 32:34.518
            Vera: It's michael's
               so-called family.

32:38.390 --> 32:39.690
          What is it?

32:39.692 --> 32:41.158
        This is the guy
      who tried to get me

32:41.160 --> 32:42.659
           To go back
     to my father's church.

32:42.661 --> 32:44.561
          Wh... What?

32:44.563 --> 32:46.463
Wh-what is the devil

32:46.465 --> 32:48.365
    Trying to do with them?

32:49.401 --> 32:52.069
      I mean, how-how deep
         does this go?

32:54.206 --> 32:57.341
  I can't believe he was here.

32:57.343 --> 32:58.508
        With our girls.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.277
                  I know.

33:00.279 --> 33:01.645
             It gives me chills.

33:01.647 --> 33:04.748
      Look, you know what
   you asked me this morning?

33:06.251 --> 33:08.719
       I want to ask you
        the same thing.

33:08.721 --> 33:10.053
      If something should
        happen to me...

33:10.055 --> 33:11.989
    I'll watch after nadia.

33:13.459 --> 33:15.625
        Listen, raul...

33:15.627 --> 33:18.695
   All we have in all of this
         is each other.

33:18.697 --> 33:21.698
     And who knows how long
     we'll even have that?

33:21.700 --> 33:23.467
  The whole world's in danger.

33:23.469 --> 33:24.634
    No one's safe, anywhere.

33:24.636 --> 33:27.771
                 So if peter has
             feelings for nadia,

33:27.773 --> 33:30.574
And she has feelings for him...

33:30.576 --> 33:32.642
 Don't stand in the way, okay?

33:39.318 --> 33:40.717
    (soft knocking at door)

33:40.719 --> 33:41.785
                  Yeah?

33:43.188 --> 33:44.187
     You mind if i come in?

33:44.189 --> 33:46.256
          Now you ask.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.799
            (sighs)

33:55.801 --> 33:57.768
         How you doing?

33:57.769 --> 33:59.736
     After hanging out with
  the devil, i'm totally fine.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.644
   Look, i want to apologize

34:07.646 --> 34:09.279
      About this morning.

34:10.681 --> 34:13.050
        I don't see why
     it's such a big deal.

34:13.052 --> 34:14.717
     Well, nadia, being...

34:14.719 --> 34:17.788
   Being a messenger, it's...

34:17.790 --> 34:19.121
        It's dangerous.

34:19.123 --> 34:21.690
   And i need to protect you.

34:21.693 --> 34:25.161
      But i also need you
       to understand why.

34:29.802 --> 34:32.668
Okay, now, i-i didn't know this

34:32.670 --> 34:34.737
     Until your mom told me
     a few days ago, but...

34:40.446 --> 34:43.813
   ...I'm your father, nadia.

34:47.252 --> 34:48.502
            (sighs)

34:48.503 --> 34:49.753
      Look, you know how--
you know how much i loved cesar

34:49.755 --> 34:51.121
       And the last thing
       i want to do is...

34:51.123 --> 34:53.322
                  No, it's cool.

34:55.127 --> 34:57.494
                   Really.

34:57.496 --> 34:58.762
                    It is.

34:58.764 --> 35:01.665
                 And to tell you
                      the truth,

35:01.667 --> 35:04.468
      When things started
  getting bad with my parents

35:04.470 --> 35:06.536
     A couple of years ago,
     i suspected something.

35:08.474 --> 35:10.874
           But here's the thing:

35:14.346 --> 35:17.414
  You can't just start acting
          like my dad.

35:19.351 --> 35:22.552
      Even if you are my father,
             you cannot treat me

35:22.554 --> 35:26.256
   The way you did this morning.

35:26.258 --> 35:28.792
   I'm not a little kid anymore.

35:28.794 --> 35:31.361
         You gotta respect that.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.599
      I will.

35:35.601 --> 35:36.900
                           So...

35:38.871 --> 35:41.705
     ...What do i call you?

35:43.308 --> 35:45.709
       Lucky.

35:45.711 --> 35:48.512
                (quiet laugh)

35:48.514 --> 35:49.846
       You're telling me

35:49.848 --> 35:51.915
 Satan himself is helping you?

35:51.917 --> 35:54.885
We're not really
sure he's helping us.

35:54.887 --> 35:56.753
     And we're sure as hell
      not gonna trust him.

35:56.755 --> 36:00.590
        And mark plowman
  is one of these... Horsemen?

36:00.592 --> 36:02.259
          He's famine.

36:02.261 --> 36:04.327
     It almost makes sense.

36:05.864 --> 36:08.665
  When i reported on the test
     of smart rain in mali,

36:08.667 --> 36:09.799
When i uncovered

36:09.801 --> 36:12.235
    The way their technology
        destroyed crops,

36:12.237 --> 36:15.172
      It was mark plowman
     who hired mercenaries

36:15.174 --> 36:17.474
      To kill the farmers
   who spoke to me on camera.

36:19.511 --> 36:20.911
      If he's your enemy,

36:20.913 --> 36:23.446
     Then i am your friend.

36:23.448 --> 36:24.814
         I'll help you,

36:24.816 --> 36:26.516
Whatever it takes.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.785
          Remember...

36:28.787 --> 36:30.820
 He's part of a bigger picture.

36:30.822 --> 36:32.255
We need to stop all the horsemen

36:32.257 --> 36:33.490
 From breaking the fifth seal.

36:33.492 --> 36:34.724
         How?

36:34.726 --> 36:36.526
       We're still trying
      to figure that out.

36:36.528 --> 36:37.861
     We know that they have
        a deadly weapon,

36:37.863 --> 36:39.329
      The genesis element,

36:39.330 --> 36:40.796
     And we know they have
     a delivery mechanism.

36:40.799 --> 36:41.965
       Plowman's drones.

36:41.967 --> 36:44.434
    Yeah, but we don't know
       how to stop them,

36:44.436 --> 36:45.869
    Where they're launching
     or what the target is.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.871
                 What we do know
             is that if we fail,

36:47.873 --> 36:49.806
              Millions will die.

36:49.808 --> 36:52.676
 And the world will be one step
    closer to annihilation.

36:54.479 --> 36:56.846
 Sounds like we've got out work
        cut out for us.

37:06.458 --> 37:08.925
                       (sighs)

37:08.927 --> 37:11.628
      That belongs to me.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.897
                   It's a lovely
                  piece of work.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.832
                   Very helpful.

37:15.834 --> 37:18.468
It allowed me to find my protégé

37:18.470 --> 37:19.936
   At an impressionable age,

37:19.938 --> 37:22.005
                   For which i'm
             eternally grateful.

37:23.742 --> 37:27.844
                          But...

37:27.846 --> 37:30.847
                      You see...

37:30.849 --> 37:33.984
 If i'm reading this correctly,

37:33.986 --> 37:36.286
        It also suggests

37:36.288 --> 37:39.856
      That the antichrist
       can be destroyed.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.558
          So maybe...

37:41.560 --> 37:44.761
You can help me make out this...

37:44.763 --> 37:46.663
   Chicken scratch of yours.

37:48.634 --> 37:51.501
  What does it say right here?

37:56.742 --> 37:59.042
       You'll never know.

38:06.985 --> 38:09.319
                          Eliza.

38:11.056 --> 38:12.956
        You're making a mistake.

38:12.958 --> 38:15.825
       I won't help you.

38:17.596 --> 38:18.662
             Ever.

38:24.069 --> 38:25.435
                   Stop! Stop.

38:29.641 --> 38:30.807
Are you okay, ma'am?

38:30.809 --> 38:32.409
          A man is following me.

38:32.411 --> 38:33.877
                Could you please
                 give me a ride?

38:33.879 --> 38:35.512
     Of course. Get-get in.

38:35.514 --> 38:37.681
    There's a police station
           up ahead.

38:52.964 --> 38:55.031
    If you won't tell me...

39:00.972 --> 39:03.106
       ...Then you'll die
       with your secret.

39:36.041 --> 39:38.108
      (computer powers up,
       whirring quietly)

39:42.948 --> 39:45.048
   (jet airliner approaching)

39:53.425 --> 39:55.658
           Houston...

39:55.660 --> 39:58.995
  You have a very big problem.

40:00.065 --> 40:02.132
  (computer beeping steadily)
