00:48.983 --> 00:50.849
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:50.851 --> 00:54.119
Seriously, Star,
there's nothing
to be excited about.

00:54.121 --> 00:55.854
- It's just--
- The best day of my life!

00:55.856 --> 00:58.724
We're going on
a field trip!

00:58.726 --> 01:00.793
Cork it, princess.

01:00.795 --> 01:03.028
I can't believe
we're actually doing this.

01:03.030 --> 01:05.330
( gasps )
He's so cute!

01:05.332 --> 01:07.733
I just wanna
gobble him up.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.768
I hope Jackie likes it
as much as you.

01:09.770 --> 01:12.738
Ooh. Conversation starter.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.339
Sh. She's right there.

01:14.341 --> 01:17.109
Yeah, she's right there.
You go talk to her.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.710
More than just hello?

01:18.712 --> 01:20.179
Too risky.

01:20.181 --> 01:21.747
I might say
something dumb.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.882
This way, I let
the kitty pics

01:23.884 --> 01:26.185
do the talking
for me.

01:26.187 --> 01:29.755
Ooh. ( gasps )
Oh, I love it!

01:29.757 --> 01:32.691
She sent me an LOL.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.193
We're communicating.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.727
- ( brakes squeal )
- We're here!

01:35.729 --> 01:39.598
( shivering )
Amazing!

01:39.600 --> 01:41.700
What is it?

01:41.702 --> 01:43.368
It's a paper clip.

01:43.370 --> 01:45.771
Yuck. Luckily,
I got my phone.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.040
No distractions,
Mr. Diaz.

01:48.042 --> 01:49.775
And for
the rest of you,

01:49.777 --> 01:53.045
no monkey business!

01:53.047 --> 01:56.748
This is the Echo Creek
Museum of Paper Clips.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.684
We're gonna spend
the next eight hours

01:58.686 --> 02:01.353
learning about the genius
of this little--

02:01.355 --> 02:04.756
Miss Skullnick!
Stop. This hurts.

02:04.758 --> 02:07.059
So boring!

02:07.061 --> 02:08.794
( clamoring )

02:08.796 --> 02:11.096
BOY: Why must she
torture us?

02:11.098 --> 02:13.232
Well, you know what?

02:13.234 --> 02:15.968
Life is boring!

02:15.970 --> 02:19.638
Miss Skullnick,
life is supposed to be fun.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.741
I used to think that,
but now I'm 50,

02:22.743 --> 02:25.344
and all my dreams
are in the rearview mirror.

02:25.346 --> 02:28.780
The best thing in my life
is teaching you kids,

02:28.782 --> 02:30.816
and I hate teaching you.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.252
That's 'cause you're
doing it all wrong.

02:33.254 --> 02:36.221
You think you can lead
this trip better than me?

02:36.223 --> 02:39.057
I was born to lead.
Literally.

02:39.059 --> 02:42.227
( raucous laughter )
Okay, go ahead then.

02:42.229 --> 02:44.096
When you fail,

02:44.098 --> 02:46.999
those brats might
actually appreciate
me for a change.

02:47.001 --> 02:49.835
Who wants to go
somewhere not boring?

02:49.837 --> 02:51.770
- I do, I do.
- Yeah!

02:51.772 --> 02:53.305
Let's go to
the morgue.

02:59.812 --> 03:04.149
Welcome to the Dimension
of Wonders and Amazements!

03:04.151 --> 03:05.918
( all cheering )

03:05.920 --> 03:07.719
What is this place?

03:07.721 --> 03:09.154
Just a planet full
of the most odd

03:09.156 --> 03:11.223
and unbelievable
things in the universe.

03:11.225 --> 03:13.058
No running,
no yelling,

03:13.060 --> 03:15.160
no horseplay, no--

03:15.162 --> 03:16.695
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

03:20.700 --> 03:24.703
You put me in charge,
so rule number one:

03:24.705 --> 03:26.205
no rules.

03:26.207 --> 03:28.240
No rules leads
to anarchy.

03:28.242 --> 03:29.841
When you give people
the freedom

03:29.843 --> 03:31.210
to do whatever
they want...

03:31.212 --> 03:34.846
I get more bars here
than I do on Earth.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.748
...they might just
surprise you.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.785
Try to have a little fun,
you big old meanie.

03:42.322 --> 03:45.490
Okay.
Walking With Trolls.

03:45.492 --> 03:47.726
I heard, once
you go in,

03:47.728 --> 03:49.895
you never come out.

03:49.897 --> 03:53.198
Wait, that's cows at
the hamburger factory. Huh.

03:54.767 --> 03:56.735
Can we jump through
this light-ray thing?

03:56.737 --> 03:59.504
You don't have
to ask my permission.

03:59.506 --> 04:03.008
Fly free, my curious
little sparrows.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.309
Yeah!

04:04.311 --> 04:05.978
Being a leader is easy.

04:05.980 --> 04:08.447
Just say yes
all the time.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.215
Take my hand, bro.

04:10.217 --> 04:12.351
BOTH: Yeah!

04:18.891 --> 04:21.793
<i>Trolls are one of</i>
<i>the universe's</i>

04:21.795 --> 04:24.396
<i>few ultra super</i>
<i>centenarians,</i>

04:24.398 --> 04:27.399
which means they live
a really, really, really

04:27.401 --> 04:29.968
really long time.

04:29.970 --> 04:33.939
I'm gonna live
to be 400?

04:33.941 --> 04:36.808
And here I thought I was
going through the big change.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.344
Turns out
I'm a teenager again!

04:43.883 --> 04:45.917
( imitates gun firing )

04:45.919 --> 04:46.985
The cat is in the bag.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.887
GIRL: Yeah!

04:48.889 --> 04:50.956
( laughing )

04:54.394 --> 04:57.229
Uh, guys, I don't think
you're supposed to ride

04:57.231 --> 04:59.831
a Dermathian stingray
like that.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.366
Miss Star, may I jump into

05:01.368 --> 05:03.035
this ominous-looking
vortex?

05:03.037 --> 05:05.871
Francis, please
stop where you are

05:05.873 --> 05:07.339
and ask yourself,

05:07.341 --> 05:10.509
is this something
you really want to do.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.010
Justin, no!

05:12.012 --> 05:15.814
Um, yes, I really
wanna do this.

05:17.517 --> 05:19.484
I really didn't
think this through!

05:19.486 --> 05:21.987
Oh, stop. You guys knew
this would happen.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.990
That's not a good idea.
Sabrina!

05:24.992 --> 05:27.459
Hey, Star,
isn't this great?

05:27.461 --> 05:30.262
Real great, but you might
wanna come down.

05:30.264 --> 05:32.864
Justin!

05:32.866 --> 05:36.368
Human expansion during
the industrialization period

05:36.370 --> 05:38.136
of the third
Nebulic Millennium

05:38.138 --> 05:40.839
gave rise to
the Fierce Troll warrior.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.974
Trolls are abnormally strong,

05:42.976 --> 05:45.877
able to lift 100 times
their own body weight.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.013
Oh, please.
There's no muscle here.

05:48.015 --> 05:51.083
Did that just happen?

05:52.452 --> 05:55.954
No LOL, no smiley face?
Nothing?

05:55.956 --> 05:57.289
Jackie.

05:57.291 --> 05:59.958
Time to drop
the A-bomb of cute.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.194
A for adorable.

06:02.196 --> 06:05.263
( laughing )

06:05.265 --> 06:08.100
No, no, no,
don't jump on that.

06:09.235 --> 06:10.936
I gotcha.

06:10.938 --> 06:15.407
Why did you let me
do that, Star?

06:15.409 --> 06:18.043
- Star!
- Sabrina!

06:18.045 --> 06:19.911
Oh, ow, ow!

06:19.913 --> 06:23.548
Don't worry. I... I...

06:23.550 --> 06:26.218
I don't even know
how to help you.

06:26.220 --> 06:30.155
"Universe's Most Deadliest
Creature"?

06:30.157 --> 06:33.925
Whoa, I told you
these weren't gumballs.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.927
( purring )

06:35.929 --> 06:37.662
What a tease.

06:51.344 --> 06:53.678
Star, can I get
super powers?

06:53.680 --> 06:55.514
Star, we're hungry.

06:55.516 --> 06:58.183
I brought snacks.
Stinks to be you.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.152
Star, can I touch it
with this?

07:00.154 --> 07:02.421
( shuddering )

07:02.423 --> 07:04.956
Star. Star, meet
my new BFF.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.291
( guttural voice )
BFF.

07:06.293 --> 07:07.926
( stammering )

07:07.928 --> 07:10.095
- Star!
- Star!

07:10.097 --> 07:12.664
- Star!!
- ( all calling Star )

07:12.666 --> 07:15.033
Can you guys just
be quiet for one second?

07:17.103 --> 07:19.504
Ah, that's better.

07:19.506 --> 07:21.339
Francis?

07:21.341 --> 07:24.042
Justin?

07:24.044 --> 07:27.279
Sabrina?
Where'd everybody go?

07:27.281 --> 07:29.614
Star. Star, guess what.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.684
Wait. Where's the rest
of the class?

07:36.956 --> 07:39.057
Fine, Jackie.
I get it.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.492
I know when
I'm not wanted.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.294
( phone clatters )

07:43.996 --> 07:46.231
No, no, no!

07:46.233 --> 07:47.632
Please work.
Please work!

07:48.601 --> 07:51.102
H-E-L-P?

07:51.104 --> 07:53.572
What's that
an acronym for?

07:57.009 --> 07:58.510
Jackie's text said
they'd been captured

07:58.512 --> 08:00.111
by some monster.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.646
Marco and I can totally
handle this.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.548
We fight monsters
all the time.

08:03.550 --> 08:06.451
I trusted you
with the class
for five minutes,

08:06.453 --> 08:07.719
and you lost them.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.554
They're not lost.

08:09.556 --> 08:11.523
We just don't know
where they are.

08:11.525 --> 08:14.092
They're wherever
this is.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.494
Wait. I remember seeing
a trail of socks

08:15.496 --> 08:17.496
right after
the class disappeared.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.998
That's where I'm
starting my search.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.170
This is it.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.072
( kids yelling )

08:27.074 --> 08:28.707
Kids, don't worry.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.076
You're gonna
be home soon.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.010
( ferocious growling )

08:32.012 --> 08:34.679
Okay, we have to hurry.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.381
Jump. I'll catch you.

08:36.383 --> 08:38.016
Come on, jump.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.051
I can't do this!

08:40.053 --> 08:41.520
Take my hand, bro.

08:41.522 --> 08:43.388
( both yelling )

08:43.390 --> 08:45.724
Hurry. Next.

08:45.726 --> 08:48.093
- Marco!
- Jackie!

08:48.095 --> 08:49.494
Hi. Hey, yeah.

08:49.496 --> 08:52.197
Uh, hey, uh...

08:52.199 --> 08:54.032
Marco?

08:54.034 --> 08:57.068
I'll take care of Jackie.
You free Janna.

08:57.070 --> 09:01.540
- Yeah, Marco,
help me.
- Gaaah!

09:01.542 --> 09:04.743
Relax. They weren't
real fangs.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.045
Unless you
want them to be.

09:07.047 --> 09:10.248
Quiet.
It's coming.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.484
( whistling )

09:14.754 --> 09:16.288
( screaming )

09:20.226 --> 09:22.561
- All right,
string monster--
- No!

09:22.563 --> 09:24.462
I'm back in charge,
and I need you

09:24.464 --> 09:26.298
to get those kids
to safety.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.601
- Wow!
- What did I say?

09:29.603 --> 09:31.469
Go, go, go!

09:41.647 --> 09:45.183
What did I say?
Go, go, go!

09:51.190 --> 09:53.425
Skullnick's really
got some moves.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.460
You bet your tuchus I do.

09:58.364 --> 10:00.665
Get ready to eat magic!

10:03.102 --> 10:06.204
Get that bus moving.

10:23.222 --> 10:25.223
( cheering )

10:25.225 --> 10:26.858
That's how you do it.

10:26.860 --> 10:30.228
Hey, Marco, is someone
sitting there?

10:30.230 --> 10:31.596
( stammering )

10:31.598 --> 10:33.365
Huh, uh...

10:34.867 --> 10:37.435
Yeah, you are.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.642
Star, hurry up.

10:43.644 --> 10:46.378
I'm coming.

10:46.380 --> 10:49.814
( panting )
Hey, Cloudy,
can you put me down?

10:49.816 --> 10:51.616
Sure thing, Star.

10:53.285 --> 10:55.253
Thanks, guys.
You're the best.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.621
We love you, Star.

10:56.623 --> 10:58.456
Love you, too.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.325
( screaming )

11:00.327 --> 11:02.794
Can you do anything
without magic?

11:02.796 --> 11:04.763
Sunshine Locker Slap!

11:07.433 --> 11:09.934
- Love you, Star.
- ( neighs )

11:09.936 --> 11:11.436
Hmm.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.538
"You use too much magic."

11:13.540 --> 11:15.807
- Blah blah blah blah!
- ( blows raspberry )

11:15.809 --> 11:17.175
Hey, Marco.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.544
Hey, Mike.
Sweet beard.

11:19.546 --> 11:22.647
Thanks, Jackie.
I grew it last night.

11:22.649 --> 11:24.215
JACKIE: So full.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.483
One night?

11:25.485 --> 11:27.686
I've been working on
mine for weeks.

11:27.688 --> 11:29.688
You know what the quickest
way to grow a beard is?

11:29.690 --> 11:31.589
Is it magic?

11:31.591 --> 11:33.458
It's magic!!

11:33.460 --> 11:35.627
I'll stick with
my peach fuzz, thanks.

11:35.629 --> 11:37.796
This may not be much,
but it's mine.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.631
Marco, I've got
a magic wand.

11:39.633 --> 11:41.332
I might as well use it.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.435
Sometimes there's a sense
of satisfaction

11:43.437 --> 11:45.336
in doing things yourself.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.205
Let me put
a beard on you!

11:47.207 --> 11:49.374
MARCO: No, don't touch it!

11:51.310 --> 11:54.379
I did it.
I grew a beard!

11:54.381 --> 11:55.714
USA, USA!

11:55.716 --> 11:57.849
Congratulations, Marco.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.251
It looks really
good on you.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.954
Star, why are you
making that face?

12:02.956 --> 12:05.390
What face?
I don't make face.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.325
You used magic
on me, didn't you?

12:07.327 --> 12:09.260
( shuddering )
No.

12:09.262 --> 12:10.729
Oh, come on, Star.

12:10.731 --> 12:13.231
Oh, you come on.
You look so good

12:13.233 --> 12:15.366
in your little beard-y.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.736
I wanted to grow it
myself!

12:19.705 --> 12:22.774
Star, my face...

12:27.880 --> 12:31.416
Wow. That is
a lot of hair.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.818
Don't you worry
your pretty little face, Marco.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.987
It's nothing a little
magic can't fix.

12:35.989 --> 12:38.857
Sparkle Razor Shave!

12:38.859 --> 12:41.292
Oh, that's a taquito.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.261
Hm. Where's my wand?

12:43.263 --> 12:44.662
It's gotta be
around here somewhere.

12:44.664 --> 12:47.398
Where is it?!
Wand? Wand!

12:47.400 --> 12:49.501
I must've dropped it
in the bathroom

12:49.503 --> 12:51.436
when Marco's face exploded.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.404
Okay, think, Star.

12:53.406 --> 12:56.040
What would a normal person
without a wand do?

12:56.042 --> 12:59.878
Work, work, work, work,
work, work, work, work.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.313
That's no help.
One second. I got it!

13:05.284 --> 13:07.719
Normal person.

13:09.655 --> 13:12.423
I'm comin' for
you, Marco.

13:17.963 --> 13:20.431
Oh, man, this would be
a lot easier

13:20.433 --> 13:22.300
if I had the wand.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.303
But at least I got you,
Mr. Hedge Clippers.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.772
( as hedge clippers )
Yeah, you don't need
no stinkin' wand.

13:27.774 --> 13:30.341
I wanna cut more!

13:33.979 --> 13:35.980
I have location
on the wand.

13:35.982 --> 13:39.717
It's inside the house,
and it's ours for the taking.

13:39.719 --> 13:43.588
That's a house?
It's covered in hair.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.456
Maybe we should
come back another time.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.358
Of course.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.894
It's just, the wand
has never been
unattended before.

13:49.896 --> 13:52.363
( all exclaim )

13:52.365 --> 13:54.432
Fine.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.434
But you idiots
are going to carry me.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.736
I don't want
a single hair touching me.

13:58.738 --> 14:00.972
Hold still,
you dumb bird.

14:00.974 --> 14:03.408
Hurry up.
Protect me.

14:06.478 --> 14:10.415
( muffled yelling )

14:17.890 --> 14:21.392
Man, not having a wand
isn't so bad.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.795
I bet I'm
all the way to...

14:23.797 --> 14:27.065
I'm still in
the living room?!

14:28.701 --> 14:30.535
Mr. Hedge Clippers!

14:30.537 --> 14:33.471
Avenge me!

14:38.410 --> 14:39.711
Keep moving.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.779
What's the hold-up?

14:41.781 --> 14:43.882
Master Ludo,
can't we take a break?

14:43.884 --> 14:45.450
I'm dehydrated.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.485
( clucking )

14:47.487 --> 14:49.387
No breaks.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.688
This is taking forever.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.624
Let's go.
Do your job.

14:52.626 --> 14:55.426
The wand
is that way.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.495
We're close.

14:57.497 --> 15:01.532
Clear the path
and move it, you idiots.

15:01.534 --> 15:04.402
Here.

15:06.705 --> 15:08.940
I'm stuck.

15:08.942 --> 15:10.408
( crying )

15:10.410 --> 15:13.578
I wish I had my wand.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.746
( barking )

15:14.748 --> 15:18.116
Oh, there, there,
little guy.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.751
You stuck here, too?

15:19.753 --> 15:22.620
Oh, I'm so tired,

15:22.622 --> 15:25.123
and his hair
is so soft.

15:25.125 --> 15:28.626
Maybe we should take
a little nap together.

15:30.529 --> 15:32.430
Star? Star Butterfly?

15:32.432 --> 15:33.731
Hello. Who's there?

15:33.733 --> 15:35.934
It is I, Laser Puppy.

15:39.471 --> 15:41.105
I thought you couldn't
get any cuter,

15:41.107 --> 15:42.874
but look at you.

15:42.876 --> 15:45.443
Thank you.
I wag my tail humbly.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.545
You must not give up.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.746
Marco needs you.

15:48.748 --> 15:52.216
But it's just
so hard without my wand.

15:52.218 --> 15:54.719
Let me remind you of
a time before your wand,

15:54.721 --> 15:57.221
when a precocious pre-teen
got mixed up with snakes,

15:57.223 --> 15:59.223
goblins and ghouls,

15:59.225 --> 16:00.892
all while looking
super cute.

16:00.894 --> 16:03.127
Oh, my gosh,
I was adorable.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.763
You never needed
your wand before.
Why do you need it now?

16:05.765 --> 16:08.866
Also, I'm a puppy that
shoots lasers out of my eyes.

16:08.868 --> 16:11.102
The choice is yours,
Star Butterfly.

16:11.104 --> 16:14.105
Either rise up and conquer
or wither here and die.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.640
( voice echoing )

16:15.642 --> 16:17.842
( gasps )

16:22.848 --> 16:26.551
- Ludo. What are
you doing here?
- It's the girl.

16:30.255 --> 16:33.658
Wait. The wand
is that way.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.560
Don't take her.
Get the wand.

17:06.725 --> 17:09.260
( speaking indistinctly )

17:09.262 --> 17:11.696
Uh, yeah, the bathroom
is occupied.

17:20.839 --> 17:23.041
Master, the wand is yours.

17:23.043 --> 17:25.276
( screaming )

17:30.215 --> 17:31.916
We've got someone
who wants to wish you

17:31.918 --> 17:33.684
a very giggly
birthday, Ludo.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.887
Here comes
the tickle monster.

17:38.991 --> 17:40.892
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

17:40.894 --> 17:43.694
( laughing )

17:43.696 --> 17:46.898
( sobbing )

18:18.764 --> 18:20.698
It tickles.

18:21.733 --> 18:22.767
It's my birthday.

18:22.769 --> 18:26.204
Hey, where is she?

18:29.274 --> 18:32.610
Normally, I'd blast you guys
with narwhals right now,

18:32.612 --> 18:35.346
but hey, you don't need
magic for everything.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.385
( car alarm chirps )

18:41.387 --> 18:42.720
Oh, my gosh, Marco.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.622
I was looking
everywhere for you.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.758
( muffled ) I'm so itchy.
Please help me.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.761
You're right. I was
using my wand too much.

18:50.763 --> 18:53.664
But I am Star Butterfly,
an independent woman

18:53.666 --> 18:55.633
with fists like hammers.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.336
( muffled ) I don't care.
Just get rid of the hair!

18:58.338 --> 19:01.639
And now, I shall shave
this beard off of you

19:01.641 --> 19:05.176
with this tiny razor,

19:05.178 --> 19:06.777
just like a normal person.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.346
Thank you, Marco,

19:08.348 --> 19:11.149
for teaching me
such a valuable lesson.

19:11.151 --> 19:13.084
( Marco screaming )

19:14.219 --> 19:16.320
What a pathetic
display back there.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.389
You guys make me sick!

19:18.391 --> 19:20.358
No more milkshake
privileges for you.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.859
( all grumbling )

19:21.861 --> 19:23.728
I want you to
use that time

19:23.730 --> 19:25.897
to think about
what you've done.

19:25.899 --> 19:27.798
Perhaps they should
use that time

19:27.800 --> 19:29.834
to think about
what you've done.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.702
Exactly.
Wait, what?

19:31.704 --> 19:33.704
Let me ask you
a question.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.307
What kind of leader
throws you into a pit of hair,

19:36.309 --> 19:38.342
makes you do all the work,

19:38.344 --> 19:40.945
and shows you no appreciation
for your sacrifices?

19:40.947 --> 19:42.980
Are you talking about me?

19:42.982 --> 19:45.183
What kind of leader
has all the power

19:45.185 --> 19:48.386
in the universe
at his fingertips,

19:48.388 --> 19:50.154
and gets tickled
right out of it?

19:50.156 --> 19:52.123
Toffee, what are
you doing?

19:52.125 --> 19:54.825
Your soldiers
deserve better.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.794
( sputtering )

19:56.796 --> 19:58.763
You are fired!

19:58.765 --> 20:00.398
Let's put it
to your soldiers.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.766
Who's the better leader,

20:01.768 --> 20:03.901
Ludo...

20:03.903 --> 20:05.469
or me?

20:05.471 --> 20:07.071
( all talking at once )

20:07.073 --> 20:09.207
You guys belong to me.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.741
Three-eyed
potato baby,

20:10.743 --> 20:12.743
I am like
a father to you.

20:12.745 --> 20:15.213
Beard deer, I took you
in off the streets.

20:15.215 --> 20:19.283
Are you stupid imbeciles
really going to listen to him?

20:22.487 --> 20:24.488
You can't do this.

20:24.490 --> 20:27.725
This is my castle.
Those are my monsters.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.860
Not anymore.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.796
Toffee.
