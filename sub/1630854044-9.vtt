queen sugar.

00:02.570 --> 00:05.270
[hollywood]<i> we knew this day</i>
<i>was coming and we pray for it,</i>

00:05.306 --> 00:06.472
<i> for their sake.</i>

00:06.507 --> 00:08.507
I just didn't know
it would hurt so much.

00:08.542 --> 00:09.691
They're calling
a school board meeting

00:09.710 --> 00:11.643
to vote on banning your work.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.946
This is insane.
We can't back down.

00:13.981 --> 00:16.015
-You raped me.
-You really wanna out
yourself?

00:16.050 --> 00:17.449
You did what you did

00:17.485 --> 00:19.118
and I will make sure
that you pay.

00:19.153 --> 00:21.620
No, if you're saying
that the summer with her

00:21.655 --> 00:23.088
<i> is the summer</i>
<i> that changed everything.</i>

00:23.124 --> 00:24.156
Hey.

00:24.191 --> 00:25.791
I didn't think you want
to hear from me.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.676
I would love to catch up.

00:38.472 --> 00:42.875
-You still go to
skate country?
-Skate country?

00:42.910 --> 00:45.811
Not since tearing up
the rink for billy.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.496
And you.

00:47.531 --> 00:49.498
You could barely skate,
but please,

00:49.533 --> 00:51.050
-with those little
booty shorts.
-[laughs]

00:51.085 --> 00:52.451
don't treat me like that.

00:52.486 --> 00:55.154
By the end of junior year,
I was putting y'all to shame.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.790
It just took me a minute
to get my legs.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.508
Okay, okay,
if that's your story.

00:59.543 --> 01:00.876
It is

01:00.911 --> 01:02.211
and I'm sticking to it.

01:05.182 --> 01:06.682
Oh.

01:09.186 --> 01:11.220
You know when I look
at you now...

01:12.523 --> 01:15.090
Feels like time stood still.

01:15.109 --> 01:17.476
Like I'm a teenager
all over again

01:17.528 --> 01:18.861
minus the press and curl.

01:18.896 --> 01:21.196
Oh, the press and curl
was fire.

01:21.232 --> 01:22.815
Those little alia bangs.

01:22.867 --> 01:24.566
You look sexy as hell.

01:25.119 --> 01:26.434
Thanks.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.654
But never will a hot comb
torch my ears again.

01:28.706 --> 01:32.274
-Yeah.
-Some things are better left
in the past.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.877
I'm glad our connection
is the one of them.

01:37.915 --> 01:39.414
I'm happy we're back in touch.

01:40.284 --> 01:41.633
Me too.

01:41.969 --> 01:43.418
Hmm.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.955
So you stay pretty close
to home.

01:46.974 --> 01:47.890
Mm-hmm.

01:47.925 --> 01:49.424
You never wanted to move away?

01:50.060 --> 01:51.093
Not really.

01:52.146 --> 01:53.762
I love louisiana.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.733
There's something about
this little piece
of the world.

01:59.636 --> 02:03.471
The way the cypress trees sway
and got that one rhythm.

02:03.491 --> 02:06.742
Big sky filled with 1000 stars
at night.

02:06.777 --> 02:10.329
And people not always behaving
the way you'd like, but...

02:11.448 --> 02:13.282
Loving you no matter what.

02:13.317 --> 02:15.834
I wish I saw this place
the way you do.

02:17.171 --> 02:19.171
And I love st. Joe,
it's just...

02:20.624 --> 02:22.341
Didn't always love me.

02:25.296 --> 02:29.765
You know, I think that idea
that this place

02:29.800 --> 02:31.016
didn't always love you.

02:32.469 --> 02:34.353
It's a story you've told
yourself.

02:37.107 --> 02:39.641
Maybe it's time you told
yourself a new story.

02:41.028 --> 02:43.312
One where you're not
the victim.

02:44.198 --> 02:45.531
You're the hero.

02:51.672 --> 02:56.175

joaquin, I'm just glad
that y'all are getting
settled.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.190
What you remember
what I told you?

03:28.225 --> 03:32.644
We're family. So you need
anything, let us know.

03:32.680 --> 03:36.148
We're here.
Okay, hold on, hold on.

03:36.183 --> 03:37.482
Thank you.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.219
Joaquin, my man.

03:40.254 --> 03:43.171
Hey, don't forget to tell
dante that I need

03:43.207 --> 03:45.707
y'all help getting
true north back
on that water.

03:46.093 --> 03:48.677
[laughs] yeah.

03:48.712 --> 03:49.995
All right.

03:52.516 --> 03:54.099
[sighs]

03:58.105 --> 03:59.271
come here, baby.

04:01.609 --> 04:03.525
Come here, my love.

04:05.279 --> 04:06.728
Yeah.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.281
Yeah, I miss him too.

04:10.267 --> 04:12.734
I mean, it's ripe, you know?

04:13.537 --> 04:15.603
They're with their father.

04:15.623 --> 04:19.241
Lord knows they deserve
to be a family again.

04:19.910 --> 04:23.829
It's just... [sighs]

04:23.864 --> 04:27.082
I had given up all thoughts
of having children

04:27.117 --> 04:28.634
and then the boys...

04:30.421 --> 04:33.238
Had me feeling things
that I pushed down

04:33.274 --> 04:35.240
way deep inside of me.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.625
And those...

04:37.645 --> 04:40.595
Feelings have started
to come back.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.098
Shae.

04:44.134 --> 04:46.234
You know it ain't got
to be that way.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.939
All those empty spaces
that you got,

04:50.974 --> 04:52.741
and they can be filled.

04:54.662 --> 04:57.696
Baby, you got a whole lot
of loving.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.915
There's children out there
who need it.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.270
Should we think about
fostering again?

05:08.992 --> 05:11.493
I thought about it.

05:11.512 --> 05:15.797
But no one that,
we gotta let him go,
that's hard for me.

05:17.134 --> 05:20.102
With blue, with the boys.

05:20.137 --> 05:21.470
They move on.

05:21.505 --> 05:23.722
Well, maybe.

05:23.757 --> 05:28.293
Maybe you could take
that love that you have
for that one child

05:29.663 --> 05:31.897
and give it to the next one.

05:31.932 --> 05:35.901
And then after that,
you give it to the next one

05:35.936 --> 05:40.072
and pretty soon you'll have
a whole world of children.

05:40.124 --> 05:44.960
Knows what the love
of violet bordelon-desonier
feels like

05:45.879 --> 05:48.130
and that should be enough
to keep you going.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.769
Talked to blue this morning?

06:10.804 --> 06:12.020
Mm-hmm.

06:12.556 --> 06:14.473
He talked my ear off.

06:14.508 --> 06:16.158
He has a field trip later.

06:16.193 --> 06:20.028
So, you know how much he loves
his explorations.

06:21.315 --> 06:24.082
Like him being in
the same city is at best.

06:25.068 --> 06:26.551
Don't sit right with me.

06:27.588 --> 06:32.174
I know, but... He's okay.

06:32.209 --> 06:36.428
He will never find out
what any of this.

06:37.765 --> 06:42.834
Not until or if we ever decide
to tell him.

06:42.870 --> 06:45.387
Maybe we should tell him.
I mean, what if he finds out

06:45.422 --> 06:47.572
-on his own?
-Not yet.

06:47.608 --> 06:50.942
-I mean, everything comes
out eventually, darla.
-Not now.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.080
[sighs]

06:59.052 --> 07:00.252
[exhales]

07:01.255 --> 07:03.722
and he ain't say nothing
about making him pay

07:03.757 --> 07:05.657
for the part of the plant.

07:05.709 --> 07:07.359
He's not paying.

07:09.696 --> 07:12.764
He's donating to the farmers,

07:14.601 --> 07:16.218
to this community.

07:16.953 --> 07:18.720
He's not paying for blue.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.056
He's not paying me.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.277
And once a month,

07:27.247 --> 07:29.247
I'll have to face
what he did to me.

07:29.283 --> 07:30.599
[scoffs]

07:30.634 --> 07:32.951
I don't think he think
about nothing but himself.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.620
You might be right,
but does it even really matter
what he thinks.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.222
It matters what I think.

07:38.425 --> 07:42.777
And since that day,
I've been thinking
differently.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.264
I'm not afraid.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.768
I'm ashamed.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.003
I'm here.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.641
And all is well.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.647
Well, I'm proud of you.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.751
An orion's get together.

08:06.787 --> 08:09.054
We here to talk what we came
to talk about.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.223
That's all the most of y'all
are in, right?

08:11.258 --> 08:13.758
The real dads on duty,
they started shreveport

08:13.794 --> 08:16.978
armed with nothing
but fatherly love

08:17.531 --> 08:18.997
and dad jokes.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.799
And that may change lives.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.118
Now I propose that
we do something like
that down here.

08:23.153 --> 08:24.452
Okay.

08:24.488 --> 08:26.854
And our kids, man,
they're getting hit
with way too much for us

08:26.874 --> 08:28.657
not to be guiding them.

08:28.692 --> 08:30.675
You got the pandemic,
you got black folks

08:30.711 --> 08:33.861
dying on tape and being shown
on tv with ease.

08:33.881 --> 08:37.516
Got trump's foolishness,
social media manipulation,

08:37.551 --> 08:38.884
mass shootings.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.852
Things have definitely gotten
worse since I was
in high school.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.587
And you know why?
School was supposed to be

08:42.623 --> 08:44.789
a safe place, a safe
environment to learn

08:44.825 --> 08:46.758
and to grow. Not to be seeing
all of these fights

08:46.810 --> 08:47.875
and being bullied.

08:47.895 --> 08:50.545
Especially hard for
the sensitive kids like blue.

08:50.564 --> 08:53.498
-All these kids
be stressed, really.
-Posttraumatic stress.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.483
You know, we got them
school board meeting's
coming up.

08:55.519 --> 08:58.153
Tensions are high.
We can be there
to calm it down.

08:58.188 --> 09:01.889
Not for the parents, yes.
But especially for the kids.

09:01.909 --> 09:04.776
And that principal over there,
he ain't doing nothing

09:04.811 --> 09:06.678
but sitting around waiting
for retirement

09:06.713 --> 09:09.331
while kids like dante,
and them other young 'uns

09:09.366 --> 09:11.883
over there suffering
and losing they way.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.052
Any kid shouldn't have
to go through that at school.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.454
Or getting shot. You know,
now getting a education

09:16.490 --> 09:17.589
has you in the line of fire.

09:17.624 --> 09:20.575
We should have kids at school
thinking they're safe.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.210
One day they don't come home
no more.

09:22.245 --> 09:23.795
-That ain't right.
-That's a damn shame.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.580
I'm about with whatever
you're doing.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.532
-Count me in.
-Count me in. I'm there.

09:27.568 --> 09:28.800
Yeah, me too.

09:28.852 --> 09:31.886
Bottom line is, fellas,
if we don't step up
and show up,

09:31.921 --> 09:32.971
who will?

09:33.006 --> 09:34.973
We ain't gonna be waiting
for nobody else.

09:35.008 --> 09:37.058
No, we have to make
the change.

09:37.093 --> 09:39.527
We are for change.

09:39.563 --> 09:41.046
-Right.
-Who's with me?

09:41.081 --> 09:42.581
-Hey, man.
-Let's do it.

09:42.616 --> 09:43.848
Dads on patrol!

09:44.451 --> 09:45.383
[man] I'm down.

09:45.419 --> 09:48.903
So what did I miss
at the last one of these?

09:48.938 --> 09:52.374
-Just give me the highlights.
-Okay. Um...

09:52.409 --> 09:56.044
I went to college, traveled
a little.

09:56.079 --> 09:58.713
Not as much as I wanted to,
but I'd love to get a feel

09:58.749 --> 10:00.415
for the world, what's out
there.

10:00.450 --> 10:01.583
Um...

10:01.618 --> 10:06.221
Then got real activated
and settled on the ninth.

10:06.256 --> 10:08.757
Worked for a newspaper.
Wrote a book.

10:08.792 --> 10:10.008
Hmm.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.259
I read it.

10:12.629 --> 10:14.896
I'm glad you're still writing.

10:14.931 --> 10:16.898
I always said you were
gonna be the next bell hooks.

10:16.933 --> 10:19.267
I don't know about that.

10:19.302 --> 10:21.603
I still have that book of hers
that you got me.

10:23.106 --> 10:25.790
You used to read me
passages out in the cane.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.776
Looking up at the stars.

10:29.246 --> 10:31.079
"the moment we choose
to love..."

10:31.114 --> 10:33.615
"...We begin
to move towards..."

10:35.969 --> 10:38.787
all right, your turn.
Highlights, please.

10:38.822 --> 10:41.456
-[both laugh]
-well, after high school,

10:41.491 --> 10:43.625
I worked in the store

10:43.660 --> 10:45.427
and I moved to st. Martin's.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.629
I met my wife.

10:48.598 --> 10:50.098
Ex-wife.

10:50.133 --> 10:52.951
Pretty recent, it's been
about two years.

10:52.986 --> 10:56.488
But we're good. We never
really stopped loving someone.

10:57.491 --> 11:01.008
And we share the kids.
We got that right.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.677
How many kids do you have?

11:02.696 --> 11:05.630
Two. A boy and a girl.

11:06.466 --> 11:07.348
[both laughing]

11:07.367 --> 11:09.350
-the boy's just like you.
-Oh.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.653
Just can't wait to get out
of here.

11:13.623 --> 11:15.407
You got kids?

11:15.459 --> 11:18.660
No. Never felt like my path.

11:18.695 --> 11:23.131
But I love having kids around,
I have two nephews

11:23.166 --> 11:24.499
and a baby niece.

11:33.627 --> 11:35.260
That last day I saw you...

11:35.312 --> 11:38.012
We were supposed to go
to that graduation party.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.766
Have our first dance
in public.

11:41.802 --> 11:44.352
I'm sorry I never called.

11:44.387 --> 11:46.488
Or that I didn't show up.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.406
What happened?

11:52.913 --> 11:57.532
You were the best thing
that happened to me back then.

11:58.652 --> 12:03.705
But I was outed to my father
and, um...

12:05.258 --> 12:07.025
He ain't never looked at me
the same.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.596
I mean up until then,

12:12.232 --> 12:14.032
I adored him and...

12:15.084 --> 12:16.534
He adored me.

12:18.522 --> 12:20.054
And then...

12:20.590 --> 12:25.210
There was a sadness...

12:26.379 --> 12:27.846
In his eyes.

12:27.881 --> 12:30.381
And it broke me.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.618
I'm sorry.

12:38.358 --> 12:41.576
Well, mr. Ernest would come by
the store.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.096
He always seemed like
he wanted to talk,

12:45.132 --> 12:48.666
but then he'd just order
number six

12:48.702 --> 12:50.635
and a strawberry cold drink.

12:53.390 --> 12:55.256
When he suggested
that I call you.

12:57.227 --> 12:59.010
I wish I had it.

12:59.062 --> 13:01.095
[sighs] you don't know
how much...

13:02.649 --> 13:06.651
It means to me that
he said that to you.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.929
That was a long time ago.

13:27.657 --> 13:29.057
What up, uncle wood?

13:29.092 --> 13:31.292
Here you go. [cooing]

13:32.562 --> 13:34.095
come here.

13:34.130 --> 13:35.763
Oh, my gosh.

13:35.799 --> 13:39.100
-She's growing like a weed.
-Doctor says she gonna be
tall like me.

13:39.135 --> 13:40.635
She at the 98th percentile.

13:40.670 --> 13:43.104
Ooh, look at you, supermodel.

13:43.139 --> 13:45.640
Ah, she gonna be a scientist.
Ain't that right, baby?

13:45.675 --> 13:47.408
There ain't nothing wrong
with being a farmer.

13:47.444 --> 13:49.110
-[laughs]
-oh, baby.

13:49.145 --> 13:50.879
-[crying]
-[tongue clicking]

13:50.914 --> 13:53.081
to be a farmer, that's why.

13:53.116 --> 13:54.249
A farmer...
You gonna be...

13:54.284 --> 13:56.217
Tell mr. Prosper
you don't like farming.

13:56.253 --> 13:57.886
[laughs]

13:57.921 --> 13:59.988
take these. We got to get
some more dads out.

14:01.124 --> 14:02.724
I know technically I'm not
a father,

14:02.759 --> 14:05.059
but after watching
dante come home.

14:05.095 --> 14:07.729
Being bullied at school,
I just couldn't sit around
and do nothing.

14:07.764 --> 14:10.198
You don't have to be
a biological father to father.

14:12.335 --> 14:13.451
That's right.

14:14.704 --> 14:16.487
So, dig it, man.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.806
I put in my paperwork
to foster again.

14:18.842 --> 14:20.341
-Whoa, look at you.
-Are you for real?

14:20.377 --> 14:22.844
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

14:22.879 --> 14:25.079
-Whoo.
-Anybody be lucky
to call you dad.

14:25.115 --> 14:27.515
Yeah, you and vi
gonna make good parents.

14:27.551 --> 14:29.183
-All right.
-I'll see you in a second.

14:29.219 --> 14:30.818
I'll see you in a second,
mr. Prosper.

14:32.022 --> 14:34.005
Just sit down
for a minute, will you?

14:37.460 --> 14:40.795
So, I mean how's everything
with you and darla

14:40.830 --> 14:43.031
after everything, you know,
went down last night

14:43.066 --> 14:44.132
with chase?

14:47.070 --> 14:49.687
Ever think about
therapy, wood?

14:49.722 --> 14:51.889
I've never done it,
but I know it does a whole lot

14:51.908 --> 14:53.658
of people a whole lot of good.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.710
Can't stop thinking about
what he did to her.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.614
It's been on my mind,
you know?

14:59.649 --> 15:01.199
I get it.

15:01.234 --> 15:05.286
And I remember when jimmy dale
come by the house,

15:05.338 --> 15:08.339
you always hear people talking
about snapping, but brother...

15:09.075 --> 15:11.192
[exhales] I was so close.

15:11.227 --> 15:13.577
All I saw was just red.

15:13.597 --> 15:16.731
But, ralph, we gotta learn
to let them things go.

15:16.766 --> 15:18.716
Nothing good ever comes
from that type of thinking.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.669
It only hurts you
way more than it hurts them.

15:21.705 --> 15:23.538
And you're saying
I should just...

15:25.375 --> 15:27.425
Let it go?

15:27.444 --> 15:29.677
How am I supposed
to let it go, wood?

15:29.713 --> 15:32.080
What? I'm supposed
to just move on?

15:32.115 --> 15:34.616
After he did what he did
to the woman I love?

15:36.202 --> 15:37.885
To my wife?

15:41.224 --> 15:43.374
I can't wrap my mind
around that one.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.410
I sure as hell
can't let it go.

15:48.398 --> 15:50.715
Listen, man.

15:50.750 --> 15:54.702
Your job is to protect
and love your wife.

15:55.438 --> 15:58.406
Focus on her. Not on him.

15:58.441 --> 16:01.876
He's not worth your attention,
your time

16:01.911 --> 16:03.645
or your energy.

16:05.115 --> 16:06.714
No, brother.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.567
Change the way you think.

16:11.655 --> 16:13.054
He's not worth it.

16:16.826 --> 16:18.276
[exhales]

16:19.796 --> 16:22.613
these are photos I took
for your insurance claim.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.132
Thank you.

16:25.602 --> 16:27.318
All right.

16:27.337 --> 16:29.587
You know I wanted to talk
to you about that one.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.272
I could barely stand.

16:31.307 --> 16:33.958
I would like to use this photo
in our show

16:34.794 --> 16:36.127
with your permission.

16:36.946 --> 16:38.829
You gonna hang this up
like it's art?

16:38.848 --> 16:39.881
It is art.

16:39.916 --> 16:42.417
Some of the best photos
I've ever taken.

16:42.452 --> 16:45.219
This photo can bring to life
the real burden

16:45.271 --> 16:46.688
that black farmers face.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.090
Storms are getting crazy.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.060
Talk about climate change
and the real people

16:52.095 --> 16:53.111
that it affects.

16:53.146 --> 16:56.481
-And you see all that
in this picture?
-I do.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.815
And when it sells,

16:58.985 --> 17:01.486
I want to donate
all the proceeds to the co-op.

17:04.290 --> 17:06.541
If it weren't for the co-op,
I wouldn't be here.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.443
Ronnie, youngblood.

17:09.512 --> 17:10.628
Thank you.

17:10.980 --> 17:12.046
Yeah.

17:15.218 --> 17:16.751
Mike...

17:16.786 --> 17:18.953
What's up?

17:18.988 --> 17:22.173
Remember when you had
your picture hanging up here,

17:22.208 --> 17:24.258
-at the...
-Mm-hmm.

17:24.294 --> 17:29.480
You and your friend.
I had no business running
my mouth about it.

17:29.516 --> 17:33.101
It's clear that you have
vision, you can see things
I don't see.

17:33.136 --> 17:36.187
See, when I was coming up,
it was a different time.

17:37.023 --> 17:39.440
But it still don't make it
right.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.892
So I'm just glad that
you don't gotta live
like that,

17:41.911 --> 17:44.212
-young blood.
-Thank you.

17:45.315 --> 17:47.014
Thank you. I appreciate you
saying that.

17:47.050 --> 17:49.050
-I love you, boy.
-I love you too.

17:56.860 --> 17:57.925
Where'd that come from?

17:57.961 --> 18:00.561
An old mill over in houma
is selling off some parts.

18:00.597 --> 18:02.063
We could probably fix up
the harvester.

18:02.098 --> 18:03.531
Yeah, I think we should
try it.

18:03.566 --> 18:04.899
I mean, it can only increase
the value.

18:17.380 --> 18:18.913
Thank you for coming.

18:18.948 --> 18:20.248
Thank you for calling.

18:21.684 --> 18:23.818
I haven't been here
for so long.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.404
Charlie was so driven
to make this happen.

18:27.957 --> 18:29.991
I want to talk to you about
your book and your movie.

18:30.043 --> 18:32.577
Uh... [stutters] I already
told the publisher

18:32.612 --> 18:34.879
that it's not happening.
The movie is dead.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.030
I promise you, darla.

18:36.065 --> 18:38.166
No, no, no.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.735
I see now what you were trying
to do with your books.

18:41.905 --> 18:43.371
I don't like how you did it.

18:43.406 --> 18:45.606
You told my story without
my permission.

18:47.110 --> 18:51.345
But you also put light
into what I hid too long

18:51.381 --> 18:53.564
-in the dark.
-And I didn't intend
to hurt you.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.436
But I did. Deeply.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.905
And I'm sorry.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.924
I believe you.

19:04.227 --> 19:06.794
And I forgive you.

19:06.830 --> 19:12.667
After seeing chase here,
where I live, where I fell
in love.

19:13.436 --> 19:16.103
Or I died and came back
to life.

19:17.740 --> 19:21.375
I realized that he has
no power over me that

19:21.427 --> 19:22.944
I don't allow him to have.

19:24.280 --> 19:27.615
He didn't break me.
I took him down.

19:28.801 --> 19:32.303
That's what I want people
to know.

19:33.957 --> 19:36.357
Your book ended
in the middle of my story.

19:38.361 --> 19:39.627
I won.

19:42.599 --> 19:44.699
Add that to your movie
and you'll have my blessing.

all right, fellas.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.316
Y'all enjoy the calm
before the storm.

20:18.351 --> 20:21.252
These kids be getting out
of class in an actual minute.

20:22.121 --> 20:23.221
Steel yourselves.

20:23.256 --> 20:25.056
I'm ready to go.

20:25.091 --> 20:26.891
Sounds like we're going
to war.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.659
Feel like it sometimes.

20:28.711 --> 20:31.045
I don't know the last time
you was in school.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.830
Was school problematic
for you?

20:32.882 --> 20:34.298
How about he was the problem?

20:36.419 --> 20:38.903
Look, I had my moments
trying to balance school life

20:38.938 --> 20:41.939
and home like a tug of war.

20:41.975 --> 20:44.675
Either withdrawal or act out.

20:44.727 --> 20:45.960
Yeah, and neither one is good.

20:45.979 --> 20:47.178
-That's right.
-Yeah.

20:47.230 --> 20:48.963
[school bell ringing]

20:48.982 --> 20:50.564
here we go.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.433
[all clamoring]

20:52.468 --> 20:54.101
good afternoon, kids.

20:55.321 --> 20:59.607
Hey, man, what was that?

20:59.642 --> 21:01.976
-I didn't see him.
-Oh, come on, man.

21:01.995 --> 21:03.811
I got eyes, you expect me
to believe that?

21:03.830 --> 21:06.030
-What's your name?
-Kyle.

21:06.082 --> 21:07.331
Kyle.

21:07.367 --> 21:10.418
My main man, kyle.
Now, look, my name
is hollywood, all right?

21:10.453 --> 21:12.987
And there's a simple rule
that good people like me
and you have

21:13.006 --> 21:14.372
to always follow.

21:14.424 --> 21:18.259
If you do something like that,
you got to stand by it.

21:18.294 --> 21:19.877
If you can't stand by
those actions,

21:19.929 --> 21:21.545
then just don't do it.

21:21.581 --> 21:22.813
All right?

21:23.650 --> 21:25.466
All right.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.585
-I'll be seeing you
around, kyle.
-Okay, mr. Hollywood.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.686
All right, man.

21:32.475 --> 21:34.225
You think he was picking up
what I was putting down?

21:34.260 --> 21:36.560
I don't know, but I felt like
I got a life lesson.

21:36.612 --> 21:39.430
Yeah, I was getting ready
to go to my locker
and write that down.

21:39.465 --> 21:41.265
-Ain't no locker. Come on.
-[all laughing]

21:41.301 --> 21:42.833
fellas.

21:42.869 --> 21:45.619
I stand here tonight,

21:45.655 --> 21:47.738
asking members
of the school board

21:47.790 --> 21:49.740
to please...

21:49.776 --> 21:52.159
Do the right thing.

21:52.194 --> 21:54.578
[clapping] speak, sis!

21:54.630 --> 21:56.163
You got this.
There's no way

21:56.198 --> 21:57.999
they're gonna ban your book
after that speech.

21:58.034 --> 21:59.633
[squeals]

21:59.669 --> 22:01.886
oh, this reminds me
of old times.

22:02.672 --> 22:04.338
What did you think?

22:04.724 --> 22:06.507
As a parent?

22:06.542 --> 22:09.143
Oh, um, as a parent,
I just...

22:09.178 --> 22:11.178
I just want what's best
for my kids.

22:12.515 --> 22:16.300
But some of those parents
aren't gonna see it like that.

22:17.136 --> 22:19.503
So he's into it.

22:20.073 --> 22:21.539
Pour some sugar on it.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.374
You mean tone it down?

22:25.227 --> 22:26.644
Subtle.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.279
It's not really my thing.

22:28.314 --> 22:29.547
Hmm.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.183
I got you.

22:37.023 --> 22:40.324
Hello. Can I get you
some coffee to start?

22:40.360 --> 22:44.512
Sure. And I'd like to try
one of each of your pies,
please.

22:44.547 --> 22:48.132
Well, baby, you must be hungry
because that's seven slices.

22:48.167 --> 22:49.467
I'm gonna try them all.

22:49.502 --> 22:51.402
I'll have one here
and the rest of to go.

22:51.437 --> 22:52.503
You choose.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.639
All right.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.675
Uh, simone, baby.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.361
Come and package up
this order please.

23:00.396 --> 23:06.384
And my friend, you get
our last slice

23:06.419 --> 23:08.719
of today's apple pie special.

23:08.755 --> 23:09.787
Thanks.

23:10.456 --> 23:12.523
-You enjoy it.
-Thank you.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.664
Wow.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.266
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

23:22.301 --> 23:23.734
[laughs]

23:23.770 --> 23:26.070
interesting's right.
This is pretty spectacular.

23:28.708 --> 23:31.208
[camera shutter clicking]

23:31.244 --> 23:33.944
who on earth is demetrius
and what is this about?

23:33.980 --> 23:35.295
Let me show you something.

23:35.314 --> 23:37.615
<i> Yo, yo, demetrius here.</i>

23:37.650 --> 23:39.784
What in the world?
You're ms. Violet, right?

23:39.819 --> 23:42.436
-Yes.
-My daughter showed me
this gal on tiktok.

23:42.471 --> 23:44.688
He reviews everything.

23:44.724 --> 23:47.224
And he is crazy about
your pies.

23:47.260 --> 23:48.976
My daughter and all
her little friends stand
in line

23:48.995 --> 23:50.628
at the farmers market
for an hour

23:50.663 --> 23:52.163
just to get a slice
before it sells out.

23:53.132 --> 23:55.132
Well, I ain't never met
this man.

23:55.168 --> 23:57.968
-Here you go.
-Oh, I love demetrius.

23:58.004 --> 24:00.037
He's so funny.
He loves you, ms. Violet.

24:00.072 --> 24:02.573
-You know about this?
-Everyone knows about him.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.158
He's got, like,
a million followers.

24:04.177 --> 24:05.443
I told you.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.244
Martin henderson.

24:07.280 --> 24:11.282
I am a buyer for hayes
farm fresh foods.

24:11.317 --> 24:12.883
And we've got two stores here
in louisiana,

24:12.935 --> 24:15.136
but we've got them
in every state too.

24:15.171 --> 24:17.354
I want to talk to you about
getting your pies
in our stores.

24:18.357 --> 24:20.825
Well, thank you, martin.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.643
Uh...

24:22.678 --> 24:24.511
It's flattering, indeed

24:24.530 --> 24:30.317
and I would need
to discuss this
with my business partner.

24:30.352 --> 24:33.971
And then we'll get back to you
about our interest.

24:34.006 --> 24:35.272
Of course. Of course.

24:35.308 --> 24:39.793
-Here you go.
-Well, I look forward

24:39.829 --> 24:41.028
to hearing from you.

24:41.047 --> 24:42.746
Enjoy your pies.

24:42.782 --> 24:44.548
-Thank you.
-Thanks for stopping.

24:47.286 --> 24:51.021
[door opens and closes]

24:51.057 --> 24:52.823
[exclaims]

24:55.628 --> 24:58.395
don't mind me. Don't mind me.

25:00.016 --> 25:03.350
Lord have mercy!

25:06.289 --> 25:07.254
You're poisoning
our kids' minds.

25:07.290 --> 25:08.989
You're the ones
that are teaching hate here.

25:09.025 --> 25:11.542
I'm done with it.
Let's keep the politics
out of it.

25:11.577 --> 25:13.861
I don't need a bunch of books
teaching my kid

25:13.896 --> 25:16.997
-he was born a racist.
-[all agreeing]

25:17.049 --> 25:18.666
quiet down.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.251
[woman] that's right.

25:20.286 --> 25:23.137
Nova bordelon,
you have three minutes.

25:26.142 --> 25:28.726
We may not share
the same point of view,

25:28.761 --> 25:31.762
but I'm hoping that you listen
with an open heart.

25:31.797 --> 25:35.566
I know what it's like
to be blinded by anger.

25:35.601 --> 25:37.601
I know what it's like
to be made to feel small

25:37.636 --> 25:39.954
and judged by
outside perceptions.

25:39.989 --> 25:41.638
Which is why it is
so important that

25:41.657 --> 25:43.941
we fight for the truth.

25:43.976 --> 25:47.811
Not my opinion.
Not a theory. The truth.

25:47.830 --> 25:50.147
No matter how ugly or harsh,
we need to face the truth.

25:50.166 --> 25:53.634
Brainwashing our kids
into hating themselves.

25:53.669 --> 25:56.971
Baby, my niece is speaking.
She listened to you,

25:57.006 --> 25:58.339
please let her talk.

25:58.374 --> 26:00.241
It's her talking to our kids
that got us here
in the first place.

26:00.276 --> 26:03.777
With all due respect,
these are good kids.

26:03.813 --> 26:05.579
You're gonna sell
your son short.

26:05.615 --> 26:08.449
-Isolation is not the answer.
-Don't tell me how to raise
my kids.

26:08.484 --> 26:10.684
-[all clamoring]
-quiet down.

26:11.971 --> 26:14.455
I'm asking you to raise
your children

26:14.490 --> 26:17.291
knowing that truth
is not the enemy.

26:17.326 --> 26:21.345
We're willing to give our kids
a gun before a book.

26:21.364 --> 26:23.998
-Something's broken.
-Now she wants to take away
our guns.

26:24.033 --> 26:25.933
That is not what she said.

26:25.968 --> 26:28.953
-Stop putting words
in her mouth.
-Everybody, please.

26:28.988 --> 26:32.473
Miss bordelon still has
the floor. Let her continue.

26:34.110 --> 26:35.626
I'm saying...

26:35.661 --> 26:40.464
Arm your children
with knowledge, not weapons.

26:40.499 --> 26:43.284
The great angela davis said
I am no longer accepting

26:43.319 --> 26:44.318
the things that I cannot
change--

26:44.353 --> 26:45.452
you know, I'm not gonna
sit here

26:45.488 --> 26:47.821
and listen to you preach
at me. You need to shut up.

26:47.857 --> 26:49.857
You know what,
watch your mouth.

26:49.892 --> 26:50.924
I'm about tired of your ass.

26:50.960 --> 26:53.644
-You need to be quiet.
-I'm sorry, ms. Bordelon.

26:55.314 --> 26:57.998
We're out of time,
we need to vote.

27:06.175 --> 27:08.375
[all speaking indistinctly]

27:21.157 --> 27:23.757
by a vote of three to two,

27:24.927 --> 27:30.364
the board has ordered a ban
of all texts with mentions

27:30.399 --> 27:33.067
to race, sexuality.

27:33.102 --> 27:35.235
[all clapping]

27:35.271 --> 27:37.338
they can't do this.

27:37.373 --> 27:40.441
They're erasing our,
our stories.

27:41.243 --> 27:42.409
Our history.

27:43.696 --> 27:45.713
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

27:47.249 --> 27:49.883
You're the only one in there
that made any sense.

27:49.919 --> 27:52.753
Most of our greatest things
have been banned
at some point.

27:52.788 --> 27:54.438
Consider yourself
in good company.

27:54.457 --> 27:56.023
There's got to be more
we can do.

27:56.058 --> 27:59.243
I knew they were mad,
but I hope they wouldn't
take it that far.

27:59.278 --> 28:01.395
Yeah, well, the loudest man
in the room

28:01.430 --> 28:02.880
is the weakest man
in the room.

28:02.915 --> 28:06.083
It was two to two
and the last man just gave up.

28:06.952 --> 28:08.502
Who's gonna take his place?

28:08.537 --> 28:10.671
We'll have to schedule
a special election.

28:10.706 --> 28:14.041
I just hope we don't end up
with one of those
maga zealots.

28:15.111 --> 28:16.810
And what you gotta do to run?

28:19.248 --> 28:20.748
You interested?

28:22.968 --> 28:24.385
Somebody's gotta do
something, right?

28:24.420 --> 28:26.220
Well, you love kids.

28:26.822 --> 28:28.389
And these ones need you.

28:28.424 --> 28:30.090
I think it's a perfect idea.

28:30.126 --> 28:32.809
You will need 1000 signatures
to get on the ballot.

28:32.828 --> 28:34.228
That's doable.

28:34.263 --> 28:37.464
Between the diner,
real spot and co-op.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.700
Local hands on work.

28:39.735 --> 28:41.201
-That's the key.
-That's right.

28:41.253 --> 28:44.238
People focus on the president,
senators, congress people

28:44.273 --> 28:46.874
but the day to day decisions
of the local school boards,

28:46.909 --> 28:48.809
police boards,
district attorneys,

28:48.844 --> 28:51.712
city councils.
That's the stuff
that really affects our lives.

28:51.747 --> 28:52.963
You got that right.

28:53.649 --> 28:55.082
Baby.

28:55.117 --> 28:58.385
Mel and nova and others
out here fighting
for these kids

28:58.437 --> 29:01.522
only to be shut down
and banned over politics.

29:04.326 --> 29:06.593
-Count me in.
-All right.

29:17.623 --> 29:19.323
Congratulations.

29:19.358 --> 29:20.857
You sold it.

29:20.876 --> 29:22.626
It's a big deal to sell
something like this.

29:22.661 --> 29:26.079
I sort of can't believe it.
You know, it just feels good.

29:26.132 --> 29:28.315
This is the direction I want
to go with my work.

29:28.350 --> 29:29.950
Yeah, it's dynamic.

29:29.985 --> 29:33.153
Your voice. You're finding it.
You're fighting for it.

29:33.189 --> 29:35.422
We're hot. Good to see
you. Dope show, man.

29:35.458 --> 29:37.157
We should definitely
incorporate a few
of these pieces

29:37.193 --> 29:38.192
in our next campaign.

29:38.227 --> 29:39.660
What the hell
are you doing here?

29:39.695 --> 29:42.162
Bro, you're selling these...
Dude, this is, this is good.

29:42.198 --> 29:43.497
We could make a lot
of money off of this.

29:43.532 --> 29:45.532
Do you hear yourself?

29:45.568 --> 29:48.035
Look, it's not a big deal,
all right?

29:48.070 --> 29:49.369
We just need to get back
in the game.

29:49.405 --> 29:52.372
-I know an investor.
-That's not how
I want to do this.

29:54.176 --> 29:55.509
What so, that's it?

29:55.544 --> 29:57.978
You're just got to drop me
after I put you in the game?

29:58.013 --> 30:00.347
-Yo, what you gonna do
without me?
-I'll figure something out.

30:00.382 --> 30:02.816
You ever heard the phrase,
"be the change you want
to see"?

30:05.254 --> 30:07.020
Aw, that's cheesy as hell.

30:07.056 --> 30:10.190
I want to thank you actually
for showing me

30:10.226 --> 30:11.992
everything I never want to be.

30:12.027 --> 30:15.796
Up close and personal,
the greed, the desperation,

30:15.848 --> 30:17.264
the hollowness.

30:18.067 --> 30:20.300
I want to feel full.

30:20.336 --> 30:23.370
If that's cheesy,
then so be it.

30:31.680 --> 30:34.281
Felt good being back at school
with the other dads.

30:35.784 --> 30:37.401
Took me all the way back.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.203
I hated high school though.

30:39.238 --> 30:40.737
What were you like?

30:41.624 --> 30:44.124
-Chip on my shoulder.
-Why?

30:45.578 --> 30:48.445
My ma and pop just
wanted me to excel.

30:48.464 --> 30:51.415
He's some kind of a student.
He's nothin' like blue.

30:51.450 --> 30:53.450
You felt like
you disappointed him.

30:53.469 --> 30:54.784
Definitely.

30:54.803 --> 30:57.070
[machinery powering down]

31:02.211 --> 31:03.677
it works.

31:03.712 --> 31:05.879
That's going to add a lot
to the property value.

31:07.616 --> 31:09.716
I thought you said
all these parts came from

31:09.752 --> 31:11.018
a shuttered mill.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.353
That's what he said.

31:13.389 --> 31:15.022
That the owner's selling off
the parts.

31:15.057 --> 31:17.791
Landry selling his parts
to a mill?

31:18.460 --> 31:19.910
That don't sound right.

31:20.963 --> 31:23.463
We should take it over there,
see what's up.

31:23.499 --> 31:24.798
Come on.

31:36.779 --> 31:38.812
This is where he got
the spare parts.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.549
That's the edge
of landry's land right there.

31:42.585 --> 31:44.251
[darla] what's up with
the property lines?

31:44.286 --> 31:46.002
[ralph] construction markers.

31:46.021 --> 31:49.122
If we let him
sneak us this time,
that'll be it for the co-op.

31:49.158 --> 31:51.758
Surround us in concrete
and block our water.

31:51.794 --> 31:53.677
[camera shutter clicks]

31:53.696 --> 31:55.562
we need to figure out
what they're planning.

31:55.614 --> 31:56.763
Asap.

32:02.204 --> 32:05.772
Well, now, that's nice.

32:05.808 --> 32:07.774
What do you think, hollywood?

32:07.810 --> 32:09.810
Sharp as a tack just like
the rest of him.

32:09.845 --> 32:13.029
I don't know, just.
My sleeve's gonna need
the alteration

32:13.048 --> 32:14.581
and the pants too.

32:14.617 --> 32:17.250
I mean the jacket's
a little snug around
the shoulder.

32:17.286 --> 32:19.186
I don't think this my color.

32:19.221 --> 32:21.922
Prosper, you have tried on
five suits.

32:21.957 --> 32:23.340
You need to make the choice.

32:23.375 --> 32:26.026
-The wedding's in a few days.
-Yeah, well, I know.

32:27.663 --> 32:29.763
Hell, I might as well say it,
I'm nervous

32:29.815 --> 32:31.164
and I want it to be perfect.

32:31.200 --> 32:34.651
Well, marrying the woman
you love is gonna be
perfect, baby.

32:34.687 --> 32:37.104
You know, it's...

32:37.139 --> 32:39.206
It's been a while since
I've had to live up

32:39.241 --> 32:40.890
to somebody else's
expectations.

32:40.909 --> 32:43.610
I mean, I love sandy leflore.
I love that woman.

32:43.646 --> 32:44.695
But...

32:46.181 --> 32:50.117
You know, I wonder if
I still have enough left

32:50.152 --> 32:51.201
to give.

32:51.236 --> 32:53.069
Oh, prosper denton,

32:53.088 --> 32:56.906
you are a good man.
One of the best I have
ever known.

32:56.925 --> 33:01.461
You're kind, honest.
Your heart is full of love.

33:01.497 --> 33:04.214
Not a mean bone in your body.

33:04.249 --> 33:07.300
You have all that.
That's a full tank.

33:07.336 --> 33:10.387
And that's everything a woman
really wants.

33:10.422 --> 33:12.389
You are more than enough,
my brother.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.341
Sandy should be lucky
to have you.

33:14.376 --> 33:16.209
Amen. Now...

33:16.245 --> 33:20.180
You go on back in there
and keep trying on these suits

33:20.215 --> 33:22.733
and we're gonna find
the right one.

33:22.768 --> 33:23.917
Yes, ma'am.

33:23.952 --> 33:25.752
[knocking at door]

33:25.788 --> 33:28.121
-what's up, mr. Prosper?
-Dylan, how you doing?

33:30.559 --> 33:32.192
All right.

33:33.696 --> 33:35.862
-What's wrong?
-So we drove by landry's

33:35.898 --> 33:37.164
and we saw construction
markers.

33:37.199 --> 33:38.899
Feel like
they planned this out.

33:43.439 --> 33:46.106
-This is betty's land.
-It sure is.

33:46.141 --> 33:47.374
-Who?
-Betty.

33:47.409 --> 33:48.642
Parker's mama.

33:48.677 --> 33:50.560
Let 'em on the land,
you don't want
nobody to know about it.

33:50.596 --> 33:54.181
-That's her indeed.
-But he don't have
no right to do anything there.

33:54.216 --> 33:57.684
I mean, if this is one
of sam's schemes,

33:57.720 --> 33:59.519
she'd have no part in it.

33:59.555 --> 34:01.071
All right, she then keep up
with the land

34:01.106 --> 34:02.439
the landry's to handle it.

34:02.474 --> 34:03.690
I doubt she knows anything.

34:03.726 --> 34:04.791
But it's her.

34:04.827 --> 34:06.526
Yeah, well on paper. Yeah.

34:06.578 --> 34:09.062
I can check with the parish
and review the land records.

34:09.998 --> 34:11.231
We need to find out.

34:11.266 --> 34:13.133
Baby, you sure you want
to open up that though?

34:13.168 --> 34:14.468
The whole lot back there.

34:14.503 --> 34:17.254
I've let her be.
I respected her choices.

34:17.289 --> 34:20.457
But this is different now.
This isn't just landry.

34:20.492 --> 34:25.429
You see that school board?
Their voices, their faces.

34:25.464 --> 34:29.216
What they did? Banning books.

34:29.251 --> 34:30.751
Stealing land.

34:30.786 --> 34:34.170
No, I was here
when it was bad.

34:34.189 --> 34:36.389
We cannot let it back slide.

34:36.442 --> 34:38.425
-You're damn right.
-I know her.

34:38.460 --> 34:40.260
She would help
if she can.

34:40.295 --> 34:41.762
She knew better.

34:41.797 --> 34:46.783
And that's why I need
to see her face to face
myself.

34:46.819 --> 34:48.135
Because I know her.

34:48.170 --> 34:50.570
And I know she would help
if she could.

34:50.622 --> 34:51.655
I just need to find her.

34:51.690 --> 34:53.323
Well, I got some people
who can help with that.

35:02.851 --> 35:04.885
All right, everybody.

35:04.920 --> 35:07.587
Just want to say thank you all
for coming out tonight.

35:07.623 --> 35:12.775
Those images at the showcase,
they really mean a lot to me.

35:12.795 --> 35:14.427
It's definitely
a turning point

35:14.463 --> 35:16.263
in how I've been thinking
about things

35:16.298 --> 35:19.800
and I just want to say
thank you for inspiring me.

35:20.302 --> 35:22.035
Um...

35:22.070 --> 35:26.239
My family is from a small town
just outside of new orleans.

35:26.275 --> 35:28.875
-Kiki's from there too.
-Shout out to st. Joe.

35:28.911 --> 35:30.443
Shout out to st. Joe.

35:30.479 --> 35:34.514
Um, and I've been thinking
about how the people
from st. Joe never give up.

35:34.550 --> 35:36.750
I was just a part
of this collective

35:36.785 --> 35:38.752
that sold nfts recently.

35:38.787 --> 35:42.756
I'm talking private jets,
trips around the world.

35:42.791 --> 35:44.391
Yeah, it was cool.
It was cool.

35:44.426 --> 35:45.775
But...

35:45.810 --> 35:48.195
I don't know,
it didn't feel right.

35:48.247 --> 35:52.032
And it didn't last,
the business crashed.

35:52.067 --> 35:54.317
I feel like the stuff
that they were selling,

35:54.336 --> 35:56.203
it wasn't a part
of the solution.

35:56.255 --> 35:58.271
It was disposable.

35:58.307 --> 36:00.106
It's a temporary high.

36:00.142 --> 36:02.075
That's why...

36:02.110 --> 36:04.477
I want to make something
with each of you

36:05.013 --> 36:06.963
that lasts.

36:06.998 --> 36:10.317
Our own collective,
for us by us.

36:10.352 --> 36:12.936
One that centers
people of color and women

36:12.971 --> 36:16.389
of all kinds, queer people,
all those people

36:16.425 --> 36:19.826
who have been on the outside
of that popular box.

36:20.495 --> 36:21.945
People who never give up.

36:21.980 --> 36:24.898
-That's the dream.
-It could be a reality.

36:24.933 --> 36:28.134
Yeah. He's been kinda
showing me the ins and outs.

36:28.170 --> 36:33.073
I've learned a lot.
But it starts right here.

36:33.108 --> 36:38.745
In this moment, in this room,
we can do this.

36:38.797 --> 36:41.681
But I feel like we can raise
this thing up

36:41.717 --> 36:43.817
with our love of the game.

36:43.852 --> 36:45.619
You know, see how far
that gets us

36:45.654 --> 36:47.621
and then figure out
the rest.

36:53.495 --> 36:54.628
-Cheers.
-[glasses clinking]

36:54.663 --> 36:56.363
cheers.

36:56.398 --> 36:57.831
Cheers.

36:59.801 --> 37:02.202
-[knocking at door]
-I got it.

37:10.746 --> 37:12.078
It's mr. Randolph.

37:13.565 --> 37:14.864
Come on in.

37:16.818 --> 37:18.051
Thank you.

37:20.422 --> 37:23.223
Hey, is everything okay
with our loan?

37:23.258 --> 37:27.327
No. But I want you
to hear this from me.

37:27.362 --> 37:30.030
I was fired today
in retaliation
for helping y'all.

37:30.065 --> 37:31.731
-Fired?
-Mm-hmm.

37:31.767 --> 37:33.833
You're being punished
for doing your job.

37:33.869 --> 37:37.003
In that house, helping
black farmer ain't part
of the job.

37:37.039 --> 37:38.905
Miller's been taking advantage
for years.

37:38.941 --> 37:41.141
Every time I report him,
I get demoted.

37:41.193 --> 37:42.592
He gets moved up.

37:42.611 --> 37:47.147
But I knew this was coming,
so I started making a copy

37:47.199 --> 37:49.149
of all of these
a few months back.

37:49.201 --> 37:50.533
Take a look at these.

37:54.406 --> 37:56.656
These are all
the applications

37:56.708 --> 38:00.160
miller's been sitting on.
These are all black farmers.

38:00.195 --> 38:02.278
Here's ms. Christina's.

38:02.297 --> 38:05.932
Darla, I'm so sorry.
I should have spoke up soon.

38:05.968 --> 38:08.084
But I figured if I gotta go,

38:08.119 --> 38:10.370
we'll make some noise
on my way out.

38:10.405 --> 38:13.590
So, and look at this.
This is sam landry's file.

38:16.945 --> 38:19.112
-Sam landry?
-Mm-hmm.

38:21.616 --> 38:24.417
They haven't made payments
in their loans
in almost 18 months.

38:24.453 --> 38:27.020
That's what he's saying.
You got farmers begging
for more time,

38:27.055 --> 38:29.356
when landry gets a pass?

38:29.391 --> 38:31.257
Nonetheless he slide
'cause he can

38:31.293 --> 38:33.643
and then they slide him
a few dollars in return.

38:33.662 --> 38:35.862
-They bribe him.
-Exactly.

38:35.897 --> 38:39.632
These people in a bad way.
They're desperate.

38:39.668 --> 38:42.369
They carry a lot of debt,
a whole lot.

38:42.404 --> 38:44.537
Always have.

38:44.573 --> 38:46.239
It's not what it looked like
from the outside.

38:46.274 --> 38:48.942
We found out they've been
selling their mills for parts.

38:50.078 --> 38:53.813
Desperate people
do desperate things.

38:53.849 --> 38:55.448
They don't want to get caught
in that fire.

38:55.484 --> 38:57.784
It will make me want
to start one of our own.

39:03.842 --> 39:06.443
So is this where you'd sit
with my dad?

39:06.478 --> 39:08.361
Usually took it to go, but...

39:09.197 --> 39:10.864
Sometimes we'd sit out here.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.817
That's just... Wow.

39:15.654 --> 39:18.338
Just the thought of him
driving out here,

39:19.157 --> 39:20.790
having a burger.

39:20.826 --> 39:22.809
Hanging with you
for a little.

39:22.844 --> 39:25.945
Wanting to connect somehow.

39:26.498 --> 39:28.481
That just blows my mind.

39:31.136 --> 39:33.503
It makes me feel closer
to him.

39:33.538 --> 39:35.705
You know, all these years
I wonder what would happen

39:35.724 --> 39:37.157
if he didn't find out.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.677
If I hadn't been scared.

39:41.730 --> 39:44.297
So I did what I wanted to do.

39:44.332 --> 39:46.533
I'd have gone
to that graduation party.

39:47.836 --> 39:50.854
Dance with you back then
in public.

39:51.973 --> 39:53.573
Who knows?

39:54.810 --> 39:56.860
Might have led to
a completely different life.

39:58.747 --> 40:00.180
Yeah.

40:00.215 --> 40:02.048
That's something else
when you think back to times

40:02.084 --> 40:04.117
it could have been
turning points.

40:04.152 --> 40:07.020
Most of the time, we don't
even recognize them as that.

40:07.055 --> 40:09.189
There's so many decisions
we make every day

40:09.224 --> 40:12.208
that lead us to the steps
on our path.

40:13.411 --> 40:18.348
And I just... I have
to believe that

40:18.383 --> 40:21.217
we all are where
we're supposed to be

40:21.770 --> 40:23.436
at any given moment.

40:24.039 --> 40:26.206
Even the tough ones,

40:26.241 --> 40:29.709
especially the beautiful ones.

40:34.916 --> 40:38.384
You know what? Bump that.

40:39.538 --> 40:41.454
No use wondering anymore.

40:42.257 --> 40:43.907
It is our time.

40:44.693 --> 40:46.025
Let's take it back.

40:49.264 --> 40:50.597
Let's dance.

40:51.700 --> 40:53.800
