00:25.570 --> 00:27.830
- I need for you
to stay back, ma'am,

00:27.830 --> 00:30.600
for your own safety.

00:30.600 --> 00:31.800
- Evan!
- Stay back!

00:31.810 --> 00:33.670
Ma'am, stop!

01:04.500 --> 01:05.500
- No, he's my husband!
- Stay here.

01:05.510 --> 01:06.570
Ma'am. Ma'am, I...

01:08.940 --> 01:10.610
- what the hell happened?

01:10.610 --> 01:12.480
- The crane was lifting
an I-beam,

01:12.480 --> 01:14.710
and boom, the jib arm smacked
into the building,

01:14.710 --> 01:17.550
takes out six floors
just like that.

01:17.550 --> 01:19.680
Poor bastard,
sitting in the car.

01:19.690 --> 01:20.720
That was all she wrote.

01:23.120 --> 01:25.120
- Anyone else?
- We're still looking.

01:25.130 --> 01:26.920
- Ma'am, for your own safety...
- He wasn't supposed to be here.

01:26.930 --> 01:28.730
- I need you stay back!
- No, you're not...

01:28.730 --> 01:30.130
- Ma'am.
- Evan, stay with me.

01:30.130 --> 01:31.930
Officer!

01:34.770 --> 01:36.800
- here's the crane operator.

01:36.800 --> 01:38.970
He just transferred to this job
two days ago.

01:38.970 --> 01:41.570
- He's my husband! Evan!

01:41.570 --> 01:42.870
Help him!

01:42.880 --> 01:44.610
- I got it on the citywide.

01:44.610 --> 01:46.480
- When I heard
a building went down, I just...

01:46.480 --> 01:47.910
- I went to the same place.
How bad?

01:48.510 --> 01:49.650
- There's four injured,

01:49.780 --> 01:52.110
and this guy, Evan Wheeler.

01:53.650 --> 01:54.880
- She's lucky
she got out of the car.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.620
- She's lucky
she never got in it.

01:56.620 --> 01:58.320
She was at home on the phone
with him when she...

01:58.320 --> 02:00.020
Ah, damn.

02:00.020 --> 02:01.790
- Evan!

02:03.690 --> 02:06.130
Oh, my god, Evan!

02:08.669 --> 02:10.600
- she's frank linden's daughter.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.700
- The frank linden?
- Yeah, this is his project.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.570
Evan was running it for him.

02:33.190 --> 02:36.190
- Mr. Benzinger, we're from
the state's attorney's office.

02:36.190 --> 02:37.760
- Can't this wait?

02:37.760 --> 02:39.660
He's got two broken ribs
and a collapsed lung.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.630
- Sorry, we'll be quick.
- It's okay, Kyra.

02:42.630 --> 02:45.700
- Can you tell us what happened?
- I'm not sure myself.

02:45.700 --> 02:48.740
21 years operating a crane,
nothing like this ever happened.

02:48.740 --> 02:51.840
- It's not your fault, John.
- I never said it was.

02:51.840 --> 02:54.140
- If you could tell us
what happened.

02:54.140 --> 02:56.180
- I get to the site
around 7:00 A.M.,

02:56.180 --> 02:59.150
check the paper,
uh, drink some coffee.

02:59.150 --> 03:02.280
- When did you get on the rig?
- 7:30 on the nose.

03:02.290 --> 03:04.190
Next thing I know,
I'm upside down,

03:04.190 --> 03:06.890
concrete, metal
flying all around me.

03:06.890 --> 03:08.660
Thought it was all over.

03:08.660 --> 03:10.120
- How much did you have
to drink last night?

03:10.130 --> 03:11.390
You're kidding, right?

03:11.390 --> 03:12.660
- John, you don't have to
answer that.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.660
- It's all right.

03:14.660 --> 03:17.800
One beer after shift,
and another when I got home.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.270
- So two beers? That's it?
- That's what he said.

03:20.270 --> 03:22.140
And I don't like
what you're implying.

03:22.140 --> 03:23.670
- What about drugs?

03:23.670 --> 03:25.770
- See? They're going to
pin this on you.

03:25.780 --> 03:28.380
- I never even smoked weed
in high school.

03:28.380 --> 03:30.210
Sure as hell
not gonna start now.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.880
- Look, my husband
needs his rest.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.350
You wanna know anything else,
you can talk to his union rep.

03:35.350 --> 03:37.690
- Why did you get transferred
to riverfront?

03:37.690 --> 03:38.890
- Good-bye.

03:45.430 --> 03:46.930
- Sorry.

03:46.930 --> 03:49.300
I was at a new project
in Havana.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.200
I came as soon as I heard.

03:52.330 --> 03:54.400
- How's Sarah?
- In shock, you know.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.100
We're all in shock.

03:56.110 --> 03:57.840
Oh, god.

03:57.840 --> 03:59.840
What's the point,
mark, you know?

03:59.840 --> 04:02.740
What... what good is any of it
if we can't protect our kids?

04:02.750 --> 04:04.210
I mean, you were
at their wedding.

04:04.210 --> 04:05.780
- I'm really sorry, frank.

04:05.780 --> 04:08.420
- I appreciate that.
Thank you.

04:08.420 --> 04:10.380
- What can we do to help?
- Well, we heard

04:10.390 --> 04:12.690
the crane operator
tested positive for cocaine,

04:12.690 --> 04:14.290
and that he was written up
three years ago

04:14.290 --> 04:16.760
for being drunk on the job.

04:16.760 --> 04:18.860
- Where did you hear that?
- I apologize for my son.

04:18.860 --> 04:20.930
He's a brilliant attorney,
but apparently

04:20.930 --> 04:23.760
they don't teach discretion
at law school...

04:23.770 --> 04:26.430
- How... how did you...
- So I'm just gonna let it go.

04:26.440 --> 04:27.870
Evan and Brett,
they were very close.

04:27.870 --> 04:29.370
They were like brothers.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.410
- We went to school together.

04:31.410 --> 04:35.740
- And Evan graduated, what,
third in your class?

04:35.750 --> 04:37.910
- Yes.
- Yeah, such a good kid.

04:37.910 --> 04:39.850
Great family from Philly.

04:39.850 --> 04:43.380
He was like a son, you know.
He was a son to me.

04:44.890 --> 04:49.420
Oh, I gotta go look after Sarah.

04:49.430 --> 04:51.260
Get to the bottom of this,
will ya?

04:51.260 --> 04:52.890
- Mm-hmm.
- And anything I can do,

04:52.900 --> 04:55.200
you just let me know.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.430
Thank you.
- Thank you.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.340
He didn't answer my question.

05:05.340 --> 05:06.970
- When you're worth
several billion dollars,

05:06.980 --> 05:09.780
people take your calls.

05:09.780 --> 05:10.880
- There's a word for that.

05:10.880 --> 05:13.910
- Yes, it's called loyalty.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.480
I want you running point
on this.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.890
- I swear, Annaleigh can make
a mess while she's sleeping.

05:23.890 --> 05:25.790
Do you have kids?

05:25.800 --> 05:27.330
- I don't.

05:27.330 --> 05:30.430
- The best of times, the...
The worst of times.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.830
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Wheeler.
This won't take long.

05:32.840 --> 05:35.770
- No, I'm okay.

05:35.770 --> 05:37.340
- Why was Evan at the site?

05:37.340 --> 05:39.040
- I have no idea.

05:39.040 --> 05:42.340
- Did he ever mention
any problems at the site?

05:42.350 --> 05:44.310
Trouble between
any of the workers?

05:44.310 --> 05:46.310
- No.

05:46.320 --> 05:47.820
Do you think someone who worked
for us drugged Benzinger?

05:47.820 --> 05:49.850
- Honestly, we don't know
what happened.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.350
You, uh... you work for
your dad too, don't you?

05:53.360 --> 05:54.820
- Oh, haven't you heard?

05:54.820 --> 05:57.390
I'm frank linden's
financial brain.

05:57.390 --> 06:00.960
Everything associated with frank
has to be the best.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.500
- Including his kids.

06:02.500 --> 06:04.370
- Mm.

06:04.370 --> 06:06.530
But Evan...

06:06.540 --> 06:09.270
Evan really was brilliant...

06:09.270 --> 06:11.070
And kind...

06:11.070 --> 06:13.310
And good at what he does.

06:14.510 --> 06:17.510
- You told my investigators
that you were on the phone

06:17.510 --> 06:21.080
with your husband
just before the collapse.

06:21.080 --> 06:24.550
Is there anything else
you can remember about that?

06:24.550 --> 06:26.520
- Uh, we had a bad connection.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.390
I just...

06:28.390 --> 06:32.590
Heard this explosion.

06:32.600 --> 06:36.000
I tried to call him back,
but I...

06:36.000 --> 06:39.070
He didn't pick up.

06:39.070 --> 06:41.500
I turned on channel 5,
heard about the accident,

06:41.500 --> 06:44.610
and I got to the site
as quickly as I could.

06:44.610 --> 06:46.310
- Mommy! Mommy!

06:46.310 --> 06:48.410
- Annaleigh, sweetie.

06:48.410 --> 06:50.010
Mommy's talking to the nice man.

06:50.010 --> 06:53.080
- How old are you?
Nine? Ten?

06:53.080 --> 06:56.020
- No, four.
- Oh, four?

06:56.020 --> 06:57.080
- Come here.

06:57.090 --> 06:59.350
Give us a minute, okay?

07:03.060 --> 07:06.560
I still haven't told her yet.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.060
I mean, how do you tell
a four-year-old

07:08.060 --> 07:10.870
her daddy's never coming home?

07:16.340 --> 07:18.570
- the crane snapped
in six different places.

07:18.570 --> 07:20.880
We were lucky that
only one person got hit.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.380
- That time in the morning,
smart money's on a pillow.

07:23.380 --> 07:24.980
Preferably one's own.

07:24.980 --> 07:27.920
- This is where the main
boom pins should be.

07:27.920 --> 07:30.480
After they snapped,
the tonnage and the jib

07:30.490 --> 07:32.550
cut through
the construction project.

07:32.560 --> 07:35.520
The boom cracked, pieces went
flying in different directions.

07:35.520 --> 07:36.890
- One landing
on Mr. Wheeler's car.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.560
- Right.

07:38.560 --> 07:40.060
- And you don't think
this could've been caused

07:40.060 --> 07:41.930
by the operator being
high on cocaine?

07:41.930 --> 07:44.470
- Contributing factor, maybe,

07:44.470 --> 07:46.470
but the boom pins
being connected to the jib

07:46.470 --> 07:47.940
would've acted like
a kill switch.

07:47.940 --> 07:49.600
- Hey, chief!

07:49.610 --> 07:51.470
Looks like we found one.

07:51.470 --> 07:53.010
- Thanks.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.610
- What's that?

07:56.610 --> 07:58.650
- This is a boom pin.

07:58.650 --> 08:00.480
See this?
- What?

08:00.480 --> 08:03.650
- Well, you can barely see it,
but those veins.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.490
That is where the boom pin...

08:07.960 --> 08:10.090
Broke.
- Whoa.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.560
- This has been treated
with difluoroethane.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.630
- Which is?

08:13.630 --> 08:14.930
- It can freeze metal

08:14.930 --> 08:17.400
to minus 167 degrees.

08:17.400 --> 08:20.000
Makes it brittle enough
to break.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.040
- So all this because of that?

08:22.040 --> 08:24.470
- Someone wanted that crane
to collapse.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.010
- So the crane operator
was a patsy?

08:33.020 --> 08:34.950
- Looks like.
They tested his thermos.

08:34.950 --> 08:36.520
- Let me guess,
positive for cocaine?

08:36.520 --> 08:38.049
- Not only positive.
Pure.

08:38.049 --> 08:39.520
There's no way
a guy like Benzinger

08:39.520 --> 08:41.419
gets that on the streets
of Chicago.

08:41.419 --> 08:43.620
Someone drugged his thermos,
knowing his work history.

08:43.630 --> 08:45.260
- And maybe somehow
transferred him

08:45.260 --> 08:46.990
to riverfront two days
before the crash.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.960
- We'll hit the union tomorrow.
- Don't bother.

08:48.970 --> 08:50.600
The site foreman referred me
to the shop steward,

08:50.600 --> 08:52.400
who referred me
to their labor lawyer.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.300
- Who claimed privilege.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.600
This would be an easier gig,
if not for the lawyers.

08:56.610 --> 08:58.740
- Thanks.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.280
Hi, guys.
- We may have something.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.410
We know that the crane
was still working properly

09:05.410 --> 09:07.080
when the site closed at 8:00.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.080
Then night security was there
until 6:00 A.M.

09:09.090 --> 09:13.090
This is from the parking lot
right next to the site.

09:13.090 --> 09:15.120
Benzinger said
that he showed at 7:00,

09:15.120 --> 09:17.730
so we figured that gives us
an hour gap,

09:17.730 --> 09:21.500
during which time somebody
could've frozen the boom pin.

09:21.500 --> 09:24.060
I'm thinking this guy
might be our saboteur.

09:24.070 --> 09:26.430
- Those are nice wheels.
- Yeah, but that's it.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.440
Unfortunately,
I can't pick up any plates.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.070
- It's more than we had
an hour ago.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.410
Can you print out
stills of the car?

09:31.410 --> 09:33.310
- Yeah, sure can.

09:33.310 --> 09:34.710
- Show these to the security
guard working the site.

09:34.710 --> 09:37.010
I'll talk to linden,
see if he can recognize it.

09:40.550 --> 09:43.650
- Beautiful, isn't it?
28 west Washington.

09:43.650 --> 09:47.350
Not even built, yet I've already
made a 400% profit.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.760
- That's impressive.
- Ah, anybody can make money.

09:49.760 --> 09:52.060
You know what's impressive?
What's truly impressive?

09:52.060 --> 09:53.590
You fly into O'Hare

09:53.600 --> 09:54.760
and you see something
you've built

09:54.760 --> 09:56.460
prick up into the clouds.

09:56.470 --> 09:58.500
That's impressive.

09:58.500 --> 10:01.370
But you know, everybody talks
about legacy, legacy, legacy.

10:01.370 --> 10:04.340
You change a skyline.
That's legacy.

10:04.340 --> 10:05.810
- I'm sure Ms. Valdez
is very busy.

10:05.810 --> 10:09.610
- Well, Ms. Valdez
is absolutely right.

10:09.610 --> 10:12.080
You don't leave a legacy
pushing paper.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.080
Am I right?

10:14.080 --> 10:16.350
So the crane operator,
we are charging him with murder.

10:16.350 --> 10:18.620
- I don't think so.

10:18.620 --> 10:20.590
- You don't think so?

10:20.590 --> 10:22.420
He killed my son-in-law.

10:22.430 --> 10:24.190
- Actually, he may...
- I'll call Bledsoe.

10:24.190 --> 10:27.390
The best private detective
agency in the country.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.630
They'll get something done.
- Frank...

10:29.630 --> 10:31.600
- No disrespect, I'm sure
you're a very smart girl.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.670
- You can pat me on the head
if you like.

10:34.840 --> 10:36.840
- Whoops.

10:38.540 --> 10:40.670
- PC felony.
I'm sorry.

10:40.680 --> 10:42.710
I confess, you got me.
Here, take me away.

10:42.710 --> 10:44.210
I apologize.

10:44.210 --> 10:46.710
You're not a girl.
You're a lady.

10:46.720 --> 10:49.820
- I'm an assistant
state's attorney, Mr. linden.

10:52.120 --> 10:53.650
- Well, very good for you.

10:53.660 --> 10:55.160
You know what,
we'd all be a lot better off

10:55.160 --> 10:57.590
if we could actually say
what we think.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.830
- Uh, Ms. Valdez wanted to know
about our enemies?

10:59.830 --> 11:02.760
If you recognize this car.

11:05.700 --> 11:07.530
- No.

11:07.540 --> 11:09.740
But in my business,
if we didn't have enemies,

11:09.740 --> 11:11.810
we wouldn't be winning.
Excuse me.

11:11.810 --> 11:16.140
- Anyone lose recently?
Or particularly badly?

11:16.150 --> 11:19.410
- Yes, Jim Florence.
That son of a bitch.

11:19.420 --> 11:21.150
Brett'll give you
whatever you need.

11:27.820 --> 11:30.160
Your father's
an interesting man.

11:30.160 --> 11:32.730
- His massage therapist.
He has a bad back.

11:32.730 --> 11:34.190
It's the price he paid
for hauling gravel

11:34.200 --> 11:35.760
at Thornton quarry
in high school.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.630
- Frank linden actually
worked construction?

11:37.630 --> 11:38.830
- He sure did,

11:38.830 --> 11:40.630
so my sister and I
won't have to.

11:40.640 --> 11:43.540
He's a great man.

11:43.540 --> 11:46.640
- Tell me about Jim Florence.
- An electrical subcontractor.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.810
Got into a beef with my father.
- Over what?

11:48.810 --> 11:51.450
What do you think? Money.

11:51.450 --> 11:53.580
Contractors
perpetually overbill.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.480
It started with
threatening voicemails,

11:55.480 --> 11:57.220
and then two days ago,
he showed up at our building.

11:57.220 --> 11:59.890
Tried to get in,
carrying a 9-millimeter.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.460
- Oh, screw frank linden.

12:03.460 --> 12:04.730
- Someone did.

12:04.730 --> 12:07.530
- Look,
I'm a small businessman, okay.

12:07.530 --> 12:09.530
I'm used to getting screwed over
by the big shots.

12:09.530 --> 12:10.730
But linden?

12:10.730 --> 12:12.630
He takes it to
a whole new level.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.740
- His lawyer said
you overbilled.

12:14.740 --> 12:16.500
- Let me tell you about frank.

12:16.510 --> 12:18.270
He always gets his end.

12:18.270 --> 12:20.840
But before he pays you,
he finds your weak spot,

12:20.840 --> 12:22.880
hits it, and offers
pennies on the dollar.

12:22.880 --> 12:25.210
- What's your weak spot,
Mr. Florence?

12:26.680 --> 12:28.580
- Off the record?
- Sure.

12:28.580 --> 12:30.280
- Most of my workers are, uh,

12:30.290 --> 12:34.220
strictly speaking, undocumented.

12:34.220 --> 12:36.220
Linden knows that's
how I make the lowest bid.

12:36.230 --> 12:38.230
- So he renegotiated
after the fact?

12:38.230 --> 12:42.300
- Offered me $90,000
on a $2 million job.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.700
I decided, "screw it,
I'm gonna fight back for once."

12:44.700 --> 12:47.570
- With a 9-mil?
- I've got a permit.

12:48.940 --> 12:52.640
Look, the crane deal,
it wasn't me.

12:52.640 --> 12:55.580
All right, the sad truth...
I need linden.

12:55.580 --> 12:57.950
He's the only one
still building in Chicago.

12:57.950 --> 13:00.950
But I'll bet you 10 bucks,
when riverfront fell,

13:00.950 --> 13:03.280
linden came out ahead.

13:03.290 --> 13:05.620
He always does.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.830
- Got a minute?

13:11.830 --> 13:13.790
I looked into linden's business
practices, like you wanted.

13:13.800 --> 13:16.300
He declared bankruptcy
five times.

13:16.300 --> 13:17.800
- They've gotten rid
of debtors' prison, Anna.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.230
It's in the constitution
somewhere.

13:19.240 --> 13:20.670
Keep looking.

13:20.670 --> 13:22.240
- Each time,
he made out like a bandit,

13:22.240 --> 13:24.000
while everyone else got
completely wiped out.

13:25.540 --> 13:26.810
Exactly.

13:26.810 --> 13:28.240
Then I did a search
on riverfront

13:28.240 --> 13:29.710
to see how much
it was insured for.

13:29.710 --> 13:31.680
- Did you find a policy?
- Eventually.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.880
He filed a certificate
of insurance with the state,

13:33.880 --> 13:36.280
a company called
Alcorine insurance.

13:36.290 --> 13:39.290
- So what am I looking for?
- The CCS.

13:39.290 --> 13:42.620
The ones to linden run through
a server called Darcolo.Net.

13:42.630 --> 13:44.990
I ran Darcolo through
every program I had.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.990
No public server with that name.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.600
- So linden's got
a private server?

13:49.600 --> 13:51.630
- Our request for a warrant.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.840
- I've got a prelim starting
back up in five minutes.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.840
You can have two of them.
- Thank you, judge.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.570
We need you to sign off
on a warrant

13:59.580 --> 14:02.310
to gain access to
frank linden's private server.

14:02.310 --> 14:04.340
- I know it's Tuesday,
but as of last night,

14:04.350 --> 14:06.710
you still need a good
old-fashioned probable cause

14:06.720 --> 14:08.380
for a warrant.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.420
- We think linden took out
an insurance policy

14:10.420 --> 14:12.890
on his own construction site
two months before it came down.

14:12.890 --> 14:14.590
- You think?
- That's right.

14:14.590 --> 14:15.890
- And I think
you'll need a lot more

14:15.890 --> 14:17.590
before I give you a warrant.

14:17.590 --> 14:20.390
Here's where we say good-bye.

14:25.730 --> 14:28.340
- You're not smiling.
- Nothing to smile about.

14:28.340 --> 14:30.440
- You know, I know a woman
who could probably hack into...

14:30.440 --> 14:31.810
- No.
- Whoa, whoa.

14:31.810 --> 14:32.870
What do you mean no?

14:32.880 --> 14:34.940
Borrelli was my friend too.

14:36.010 --> 14:38.450
- Who?

14:38.450 --> 14:40.010
- I said no.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.320
- Who?

14:46.050 --> 14:48.360
Linden put his whole life
online.

14:48.360 --> 14:50.020
Yearbooks, college homework,

14:50.030 --> 14:52.430
report cards,
little league stats.

14:52.430 --> 14:54.360
Should I ask how you got this?

14:54.360 --> 14:56.860
- No.
- Then tell me about Borrelli.

14:56.870 --> 14:59.070
Why... you and stone knew...

14:59.070 --> 15:00.870
- look, if you
don't wanna help...

15:00.870 --> 15:02.070
- That's not what I said.

15:02.070 --> 15:05.940
But this feels,
at best, sketchy.

15:10.380 --> 15:12.680
Danny Borrelli was with
engine sixty seven.

15:12.680 --> 15:14.050
He was a good guy.

15:14.050 --> 15:16.850
He was married...
A couple of girls.

15:16.850 --> 15:18.850
He and stone
used to box in my gym.

15:18.850 --> 15:20.950
They'd drink together, and get
into trouble once or twice.

15:20.960 --> 15:23.990
- Hard to imagine
stone getting into trouble.

15:23.990 --> 15:25.790
- One day, Danny turned out.

15:25.790 --> 15:27.790
It was a building collapse

15:27.800 --> 15:30.930
at an office complex
in the west loop.

15:32.700 --> 15:34.870
It was a death trap.

15:34.870 --> 15:38.110
Safety violations, permits
that had been bought off.

15:38.110 --> 15:40.970
Danny never made it out.

15:40.980 --> 15:42.880
- Linden owned the building.

15:44.980 --> 15:48.080
And he skated.
- He always skates.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.420
Not this time.

15:57.730 --> 15:59.030
You ever heard of Henry Tomczak?

15:59.030 --> 16:00.930
- Yeah, uh,
head of the local 409.

16:00.930 --> 16:03.100
Mob ties.
- That's the guy.

16:03.100 --> 16:05.800
Frank linden reached out to him
six times in the last 30 days.

16:05.800 --> 16:08.540
"Tomczak, we need to talk now."
Look.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.840
- "Tomczak, meet me at 10:00,
Scappy's bar."

16:13.840 --> 16:15.810
That's four days before
the crane went down.

16:15.810 --> 16:17.440
- A Ci of mine
tends bar at Scappy's.

16:17.450 --> 16:18.710
You wanna get a real drink?

16:18.710 --> 16:19.750
It's 1:00 in the afternoon,

16:19.750 --> 16:21.480
but if you're buying...

16:24.950 --> 16:26.950
- I wish you wouldn't come here.

16:26.960 --> 16:29.860
- Did you see frank linden here
or not?

16:29.860 --> 16:31.790
He came in at 10:00,

16:31.790 --> 16:33.490
then Tomczak joins him.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.030
I don't wanna get involved,
you know,

16:35.030 --> 16:36.860
but when I bring drinks,
I hear Tomczak say

16:36.870 --> 16:39.070
something about riverfront.
- What'd they say?

16:39.070 --> 16:41.470
- I don't know.

16:41.470 --> 16:43.970
But a little later,
this lady comes in, joins him.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.740
Rich.

16:45.740 --> 16:47.870
Definitely stood out
in a place like this.

16:47.880 --> 16:49.810
Seemed real,
I don't know, agitated.

16:49.810 --> 16:51.750
Good-looking.
Maybe 30, brunette.

16:51.750 --> 16:54.050
Nice ass.
- That's nice, Eddie.

16:54.050 --> 16:56.950
- How's that?
- Yeah, that's her.

16:58.590 --> 17:00.450
I said, "cash only, dude."

17:02.160 --> 17:04.589
- Sarah Wheeler,
linden's daughter.

17:04.589 --> 17:06.230
- The grieving widow.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.500
- You sure it was her?
- Yeah, he recognized her photo.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.099
- With linden?
- And Tomczak from the local.

17:14.099 --> 17:15.940
- Yeah, I know who he is.

17:15.940 --> 17:17.040
And you found out about
this information how?

17:17.040 --> 17:18.770
- I told you, a Ci...

17:18.770 --> 17:20.140
- because I don't wanna
go down this road

17:20.140 --> 17:21.780
just to have it
thrown out of court

17:21.780 --> 17:23.210
because of someone's
personal agenda.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.109
- You don't wanna use it,
don't use it.

17:25.109 --> 17:26.510
- I don't see the problem.
We're investigators.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.079
We investigate.

17:28.079 --> 17:31.520
One of my cis reached out to me
out of the blue.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.250
We checked it out.

17:36.220 --> 17:38.190
- Good work.

17:41.830 --> 17:44.900
- Peter, you should see this.

17:46.130 --> 17:49.500
This is the newscast
the wife said she saw.

17:49.510 --> 17:52.910
<i>- The fire is not yet contained.
And we have breaking news...</i>

17:52.910 --> 17:54.140
- there.
Look at the time.

17:54.140 --> 17:56.110
7:33.

17:56.110 --> 18:00.910
According to cpd, Sarah Wheeler
arrived at the site at 7:29.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.920
She told you she saw
the report on the news,

18:02.920 --> 18:05.120
and then left her apartment.

18:08.190 --> 18:10.090
- When you showed up
at the site,

18:10.090 --> 18:12.230
you told the police that
he wasn't supposed to be here.

18:12.230 --> 18:14.060
What did you mean?

18:14.060 --> 18:16.860
- I don't remember.
I wasn't thinking.

18:16.870 --> 18:19.300
- Or you felt guilty.

18:19.300 --> 18:21.670
You said you saw it on channel 5
before you went to the site,

18:21.670 --> 18:25.610
but they didn't report it until
four minutes after you arrived.

18:25.610 --> 18:27.670
- What are you suggesting?

18:27.680 --> 18:29.180
- If your father started
something you couldn't stop

18:29.180 --> 18:30.610
just to make money,

18:30.610 --> 18:32.950
now is the time
to get ahead of it.

18:32.950 --> 18:35.120
- We know you and your father
met with Henry Tomczak

18:35.120 --> 18:37.580
at Scappy's bar
four nights before

18:37.590 --> 18:40.650
your husband was murdered.

18:40.660 --> 18:42.590
- Murdered?
- Bringing down a crane

18:42.590 --> 18:44.120
in the middle
of downtown Chicago?

18:44.130 --> 18:46.090
That constitutes
a strong probability

18:46.090 --> 18:47.590
of death or great bodily harm,

18:47.600 --> 18:50.030
which makes it
first-degree murder, Sarah.

18:52.100 --> 18:54.970
- I can't help you.
- Then maybe your brother can.

18:54.970 --> 18:58.310
- Good luck with that.
Brett worships frank.

18:58.310 --> 19:02.040
Frank would never do anything
to convince him otherwise.

19:02.040 --> 19:06.710
I respect your enthusiasm,
but you can't beat frank.

19:06.720 --> 19:09.720
No one can.

19:09.720 --> 19:12.090
- I can have you arrested,
Mrs. Wheeler...

19:13.050 --> 19:14.650
Right now.

19:17.660 --> 19:21.290
The train leaves the station
in five, four...

19:21.300 --> 19:23.160
- Annaleigh.
- She'll be placed with

19:23.170 --> 19:25.170
the department of children
and family services.

19:25.170 --> 19:27.200
And I promise,
I will do everything I can

19:27.200 --> 19:30.070
to make sure she stays there
until she can vote.

19:30.070 --> 19:32.640
- Please.
- Three, two...

19:32.640 --> 19:34.170
- Stop!

19:34.180 --> 19:36.310
Fine.

19:36.310 --> 19:38.310
Whatever you want.

19:38.310 --> 19:41.110
- You knew the crane
was going to collapse.

19:52.260 --> 19:54.190
- Cuffs and a perp walk?

19:54.200 --> 19:55.960
This is frank linden, not some...

19:55.960 --> 19:57.400
- be grateful the judge
granted him bail.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.670
- Relax, Brett, it'll only
increase the damages

19:59.670 --> 20:03.000
I'll collect when I sue
for malicious prosecution.

20:03.010 --> 20:04.200
- Yeah, that's one way
to look at it.

20:04.210 --> 20:06.070
The other is to cut your losses

20:06.070 --> 20:07.970
and plead guilty to
the murder of Evan Wheeler.

20:07.980 --> 20:10.110
- Okay, yeah, I'll do that.
Where's mark Jefferies?

20:10.110 --> 20:12.010
There's no way
he signed off on this.

20:12.010 --> 20:14.150
- Have you spoken with
your daughter recently, frank?

20:14.150 --> 20:16.950
- She told us everything.
- She's scared of you, frank,

20:16.950 --> 20:18.690
but not scared enough
to go to prison.

20:18.690 --> 20:20.250
- Why don't you just
give us a moment...

20:20.260 --> 20:21.760
- shut up, Brett.

20:25.690 --> 20:29.330
Wow, that's a good try.
That's a really good try.

20:29.330 --> 20:31.100
I've sat across the table

20:31.100 --> 20:33.270
from the best negotiators
in the world,

20:33.270 --> 20:37.140
men of ineffable wealth
and actual power and acumen,

20:37.140 --> 20:39.210
who try to make me
fold my trip Jacks

20:39.210 --> 20:41.980
with their... with their
measly pair of trays.

20:41.980 --> 20:43.740
And you wanna know something?

20:43.750 --> 20:46.010
They learned what you're
about to learn, the hard way.

20:46.010 --> 20:49.980
Frank linden
doesn't fold on a bluff.

20:49.990 --> 20:54.290
There's no way Sarah
ever testifies against me.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.330
- He may not be wrong
about Sarah.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.230
- How are we doing with Tomczak?

21:05.230 --> 21:07.400
- I'll call Dawson and Nagel.

21:09.840 --> 21:11.400
- I run the local.

21:11.410 --> 21:13.710
I had drinks with
the biggest builder in the city.

21:13.710 --> 21:16.410
I'm sorry, but that's not gonna
make the 5:00 news.

21:16.410 --> 21:18.750
- It might, considering it was
four nights before

21:18.750 --> 21:22.220
the builder's crane collapsed.
- Which put my guys out of work.

21:22.220 --> 21:24.180
- We could continue
this conversation

21:24.190 --> 21:25.750
in front of a grand jury,
if you don't wanna talk here.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.350
- If you could've, you would've.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.420
Besides, I don't know anything
about riverfront.

21:29.420 --> 21:31.160
- Your people worked it.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.330
- I have 12,000 people
to worry about.

21:33.330 --> 21:35.730
- Is this an Atlantic sailfish?

21:35.730 --> 21:38.400
That's gotta be 6 feet.
Where'd you catch it?

21:38.400 --> 21:41.100
- Florida keys in Boca Chica,

21:41.100 --> 21:43.240
and it's 7 feet.

21:43.240 --> 21:46.310
My dad used to take me fishing
at hawks cay.

21:46.310 --> 21:48.140
You gotta let me
take a picture to send him.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.340
I... this would kill him.

21:50.350 --> 21:52.180
- If it'll get you out of here.

21:52.180 --> 21:54.250
- Oh, thank you.

21:57.220 --> 21:58.750
- And here I never
even considered

21:58.750 --> 22:00.250
the deep-sea fishing angle
of the case.

22:00.260 --> 22:02.190
That should crack things
wide open.

22:02.190 --> 22:03.520
- That isn't what I wanted
a picture of.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.330
I just know that men
love to brag about

22:05.330 --> 22:07.360
the size of their fish.
- Ha.

22:07.360 --> 22:11.130
- I wanted a picture
of the photo next to his fish.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.540
2008 dodge challenger,

22:15.540 --> 22:17.400
the same car
that was photographed

22:17.410 --> 22:20.310
leaving waterfront
the morning of the crash.

22:20.310 --> 22:22.340
- Very good, Nagel.
Very good.

22:22.340 --> 22:24.810
Now run the plates,
see if we can ID our car buff.

22:24.810 --> 22:27.180
- Very good, Dawson.
Very good.

22:29.180 --> 22:31.180
- I told you, I haven't seen
Tommy in three days.

22:31.190 --> 22:33.190
He just took off.
- To where?

22:33.190 --> 22:35.490
- The Caribbean.
Left all of a sudden.

22:35.490 --> 22:37.360
Said he wants to learn
to scuba dive.

22:37.360 --> 22:39.260
Can't get him to take me
to twin lakes.

22:39.260 --> 22:41.390
All of a sudden,
he's gotta dive.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.560
- You remember where Tommy was
the morning before he left?

22:43.570 --> 22:46.570
- No, but he's been keeping
weird hours lately.

22:46.570 --> 22:48.570
Probably got himself
another girl.

22:48.570 --> 22:51.400
Bet she scuba dives.

22:51.410 --> 22:53.310
- Check it out.

22:55.880 --> 22:57.480
Difluoroethane,

22:57.480 --> 23:00.310
same thing he used
to freeze the boom pins.

23:00.320 --> 23:01.850
- It's empty.

23:01.850 --> 23:04.180
Looks like we found
our riverfront saboteur.

23:11.360 --> 23:13.260
- Do you know
linden wrote a book?

23:13.260 --> 23:15.400
It's been out of print
for ten years.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.260
We ID'd the guy
who sabotaged the crane,

23:17.270 --> 23:18.430
and with the daughter's
testimony...

23:18.430 --> 23:20.400
- I just made a deal
with linden.

23:22.370 --> 23:24.440
I could hear half
the city council cheering

23:24.440 --> 23:26.410
when I signed it.

23:26.410 --> 23:29.910
- I've got him, mark.
- It's done.

23:29.910 --> 23:32.180
- No jail time?
Are you kidding?

23:32.180 --> 23:35.180
- Some battles aren't worth
the losses, Peter.

23:35.180 --> 23:37.350
- This isn't some
OSHA violation.

23:37.350 --> 23:39.550
Linden didn't just skimp
on the grade of cement.

23:39.550 --> 23:43.560
This was an intentional act
that resulted in murder.

23:43.560 --> 23:46.960
- Perhaps, but I'm not convinced
you can prove it.

23:52.430 --> 23:53.530
- Mr. stone,
I understand you've reached

23:53.540 --> 23:55.270
a settlement in the case.

23:55.270 --> 23:56.940
- Yes, your honor,
we've provided the court

23:56.940 --> 23:58.870
with an executed plea agreement
with linden corp.

23:58.870 --> 24:00.270
- That's agreeable
with the defense?

24:00.280 --> 24:01.910
- It is, your honor.
- Okay.

24:01.910 --> 24:03.610
Unless there's
any other business...

24:03.610 --> 24:05.010
- actually, the people
have a request, your honor.

24:05.010 --> 24:06.450
- Go ahead.

24:06.450 --> 24:08.010
- The indictment
against linden corp

24:08.020 --> 24:09.480
was satisfied
with a $500,000 fine.

24:09.480 --> 24:10.920
- Court's aware of that.

24:10.920 --> 24:12.490
- But the grand jury
also handed down

24:12.490 --> 24:15.420
a murder indictment
for frank linden personally.

24:15.420 --> 24:19.390
I request that Mr. linden
be taken into custody now.

24:19.390 --> 24:21.930
- Big mistake, Mr. stone.

24:37.950 --> 24:39.510
Well, well, well,

24:39.510 --> 24:43.080
you certainly are
a creature of habit, mark.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.350
- It's gotten me this far.

24:46.350 --> 24:48.050
- You knew I'd be out
in 20 minutes.

24:48.060 --> 24:50.360
- We shouldn't be talking.

24:50.360 --> 24:52.260
- A crane collapsed,

24:52.260 --> 24:53.990
destroyed my building.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.530
It doesn't have to destroy
30 years of friendship.

24:56.530 --> 24:58.460
- A friend wouldn't put me
in this position.

24:58.470 --> 25:00.970
- A friend would
look me in the eye,

25:00.970 --> 25:02.500
and ask me to my face,

25:02.500 --> 25:05.570
am I responsible for
my son-in-law's death.

25:05.570 --> 25:07.710
- Are you?
- Ah...

25:10.350 --> 25:12.450
When I completed
my first project,

25:12.450 --> 25:16.550
7333 north Sheridan,
22 stories residential,

25:16.550 --> 25:18.050
I went up to the roof,

25:18.050 --> 25:20.420
and man,
I was on top of the world.

25:20.420 --> 25:22.990
I was on top of the world.

25:22.990 --> 25:24.590
And then I looked south,

25:24.590 --> 25:27.460
and Fowler's throwing up
45 on Lake Shore drive,

25:27.460 --> 25:29.400
45 stories of glass and steel.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.100
And it tore a hole in my heart.

25:31.100 --> 25:34.000
It tore a hole in my heart
that's still there.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
So I threw up 50
on north Wabash,

25:36.000 --> 25:39.070
and then I see Flemming
throwing up 65.

25:39.070 --> 25:41.010
- That's why man invented
tape measurers.

25:41.010 --> 25:44.010
- No, no, no, no, no,
it's not about pumping my chest.

25:44.010 --> 25:45.680
- Really?
- No.

25:45.680 --> 25:48.350
It's about going up to the top,

25:48.350 --> 25:50.450
and looking around,

25:50.450 --> 25:52.550
and knowing that nobody...

25:52.550 --> 25:55.050
Nobody is closer to god than me.

25:55.060 --> 25:57.020
I am not responsible
for Evan's death,

25:57.030 --> 25:58.560
for crying out loud.

25:58.560 --> 26:00.560
And the more your people
hassle my people,

26:00.560 --> 26:02.430
and you know
who I'm talking about,

26:02.430 --> 26:06.030
the harder it is for me
to do my business.

26:06.030 --> 26:08.030
- I took an oath, frank,

26:08.040 --> 26:10.440
to protect and serve
all the people in the county,

26:10.440 --> 26:14.370
not only those whose numbers
are in my iPhone.

26:15.340 --> 26:18.010
- 30 years of friendship
doesn't count for anything?

26:22.550 --> 26:24.380
Okay.

26:24.390 --> 26:27.120
Okay.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.790
I see what you're doing, mark.

26:28.790 --> 26:30.720
You're putting up
your own building, huh?

26:30.730 --> 26:33.490
Your own structure?
I mean, not 45 stories of brick

26:33.500 --> 26:37.460
and mortar and glass and steel,
but I see it, story by story.

26:37.470 --> 26:39.600
And you wanna know something?

26:39.600 --> 26:42.070
You know I'm the only one

26:42.070 --> 26:45.170
who can stop you from
getting to your rooftop.

27:00.620 --> 27:02.590
- I'm the CFO of linden corp.

27:02.590 --> 27:03.690
- And you deal with banks,

27:03.690 --> 27:04.820
mortgage companies, lenders,

27:04.830 --> 27:06.430
things like that?
- Yes.

27:06.430 --> 27:07.630
- How is the riverfront
project doing?

27:07.630 --> 27:10.560
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

27:10.570 --> 27:12.500
What was the construction loan
on riverfront?

27:12.500 --> 27:14.300
- $200 million.

27:14.300 --> 27:15.840
- How much a month
do you pay in interest?

27:15.840 --> 27:18.140
- About $700,000 per month.

27:18.140 --> 27:20.670
- And is the project
continuing ahead on schedule?

27:20.680 --> 27:22.510
- Not now.
- I'm sorry, I meant

27:22.510 --> 27:24.610
before the recent
crane accident.

27:24.610 --> 27:26.680
- We were several months
behind schedule.

27:26.680 --> 27:29.580
- How many, exactly?
- Ten.

27:29.580 --> 27:32.590
- Well, that's... that's
$7 million in interest payments.

27:32.590 --> 27:34.350
- Approximately.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.860
- If construction continued
at that pace,

27:35.860 --> 27:37.360
then the company stood to lose
how much money?

27:37.360 --> 27:38.520
- Well, that's hard to say.

27:38.530 --> 27:40.160
- Why is that?

27:40.160 --> 27:41.730
- Because we're insured
against accidents

27:41.730 --> 27:44.460
that cause us to stop
construction completely.

27:44.470 --> 27:46.430
- Like a crane collapsing?

27:46.430 --> 27:48.600
- That's right.
- How much are you insured for?

27:48.600 --> 27:50.700
- The projected fair market
value of the building.

27:50.710 --> 27:54.540
- Which is?
- $570 million.

27:54.540 --> 27:55.880
- It sounds like
the crane accident

27:55.880 --> 27:57.640
was actually
a blessing in disguise.

27:57.650 --> 27:59.550
- Objection.
Is there a question?

27:59.550 --> 28:01.110
- It wasn't an accident at all
that the crane collapsed,

28:01.120 --> 28:02.850
was it, Mrs. Wheeler?

28:04.750 --> 28:06.490
In fact, you knew in advance

28:06.490 --> 28:08.690
the crane was going to collapse,
didn't you?

28:10.490 --> 28:12.160
Mrs. Wheeler...

28:13.560 --> 28:16.760
Who decided to sabotage
the boom pins on the crane?

28:19.770 --> 28:21.870
We stood in your apartment,
and you told me...

28:21.870 --> 28:24.670
- I want to, uh...
- What, Mrs. Wheeler?

28:29.780 --> 28:31.780
- I want to take the fifth.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.540
- I told you
you couldn't beat frank.

28:59.540 --> 29:00.840
- Actually,
you never did say that.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.610
You just told me
what a great man he was.

29:02.610 --> 29:04.680
- Nothing's changed.

29:04.680 --> 29:06.610
- You do realize
that he killed Evan...

29:06.610 --> 29:07.910
- oh, Jesus.

29:08.950 --> 29:11.250
Sometimes, you have to do
whatever it takes

29:11.250 --> 29:13.520
to get the job done.

29:17.760 --> 29:19.690
- You knew?

29:19.690 --> 29:21.930
Sarah said frank would never
let you in on his dirty secrets.

29:21.930 --> 29:24.460
Oh, my god,
she was protecting you.

29:24.470 --> 29:26.700
- I have to go.
- She was protecting you,

29:26.700 --> 29:28.630
and you're gonna let her
go to prison.

29:28.640 --> 29:30.940
- The world looks
very different to me...

29:33.580 --> 29:35.780
and I'd like to
keep it that way.

29:37.980 --> 29:39.650
- Thank you.
- Peter?

29:39.650 --> 29:41.680
- Excuse me.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.720
I took the deal
you told me to take.

29:43.720 --> 29:45.450
- I heard what you did.

29:45.450 --> 29:46.990
- Half a million
is a pimple on linden's ass.

29:46.990 --> 29:49.720
He needs to hear
the jail door slam behind him.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.690
- I agree.

29:51.690 --> 29:52.990
- You do?
- Yeah.

29:52.990 --> 29:55.490
Friendship only goes so far.

29:55.500 --> 29:57.630
But the daughter
taking the hit hurts.

29:57.630 --> 29:59.530
- We still have
the difluoroethane

29:59.530 --> 30:02.300
and the insurance policy.
- No, you have nothing yet.

30:02.300 --> 30:03.940
But you never know
What'll come out

30:03.940 --> 30:07.570
when a malignant narcissist
opens his mouth.

30:08.710 --> 30:09.980
- Helen Coren, his new lawyer...

30:09.980 --> 30:12.010
She'll never put him
on the stand.

30:12.010 --> 30:14.680
- Sometimes a lawyer
doesn't have a choice.

30:17.280 --> 30:20.790
- The opera benefit?
- I hope you have a tux.

30:37.270 --> 30:39.970
Frank!
- Mr. stone...

30:39.970 --> 30:42.840
I wouldn't have taken you
for a patron of the arts.

30:42.840 --> 30:44.780
- And I wouldn't have taken you
for a killer,

30:44.780 --> 30:47.610
but life's full of surprises.

30:47.620 --> 30:49.020
- You know what,
this isn't the appropriate place

30:49.020 --> 30:50.580
to have this conversation.

30:50.590 --> 30:51.820
I wouldn't know.
I'm not a lawyer.

30:51.820 --> 30:53.620
Well, you practically are.

30:53.620 --> 30:55.350
I mean, all the time you spent
in bankruptcy court.

30:55.360 --> 30:57.520
- I am so sorry.

30:57.530 --> 31:00.890
I apologize.
We have a very sore loser here.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.930
Everybody come on upstairs,
enjoy yourselves.

31:02.930 --> 31:04.760
I'm gonna go have a chat
with my friends.

31:04.770 --> 31:06.800
- Who are you kidding, frank?

31:06.800 --> 31:07.930
You're just a kid
from back of the yards,

31:07.940 --> 31:10.300
the son of a bricklayer.

31:10.310 --> 31:13.570
Now, your old man,
he helped build big buildings,

31:13.570 --> 31:15.610
but he could never afford
to live in 'em.

31:15.610 --> 31:18.640
Even if he could,
they wouldn't want his type.

31:18.650 --> 31:20.550
Truth is, nothing's changed.

31:20.550 --> 31:23.920
If you didn't own the buildings,
your friends...

31:23.920 --> 31:25.990
They wouldn't let you near 'em.

31:25.990 --> 31:27.690
- I am asking you nicely.

31:27.690 --> 31:29.390
- How many lives did you destroy

31:29.390 --> 31:31.390
to be able to live in
that penthouse of yours, frank?

31:31.390 --> 31:32.990
You know what my old man
told me?

31:32.990 --> 31:35.900
He said, "the true measure
of a man's wealth"

31:35.900 --> 31:38.930
is how much he'd be worth
if he lost all his money."

31:38.930 --> 31:41.800
Now, truth be told,
you're pretty worthless, frank.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.640
You know it, and I know it,

31:43.640 --> 31:45.670
and everybody here knows it.

31:45.670 --> 31:47.340
The great frank linden

31:47.340 --> 31:49.410
picked himself up
by his bootstraps

31:49.410 --> 31:51.710
and dumped himself in the sewer.

31:54.380 --> 31:57.020
You think this is over?

31:57.020 --> 31:58.780
I'm just getting started.

32:01.790 --> 32:04.420
- get him out of here.

32:04.430 --> 32:06.960
- You don't create, frank.
You destroy.

32:09.030 --> 32:10.960
Good night, frank!

32:18.610 --> 32:19.910
- All rise.

32:23.610 --> 32:26.650
- Please be seated.

32:26.650 --> 32:28.880
Call your next witness,
Mr. stone.

32:28.880 --> 32:32.420
- The people rest, and await
Mr. linden's vigorous defense.

32:32.420 --> 32:34.890
- "The people rest"
will suffice.

32:34.890 --> 32:36.920
Ms. Coren?

32:36.920 --> 32:40.560
- The defense likewise rests,
your honor.

32:42.700 --> 32:44.500
- One second, your honor.

32:46.970 --> 32:48.600
I wanna testify.

32:55.180 --> 32:57.580
- The defense calls
frank linden.

33:04.890 --> 33:07.490
- This whole thing
is nothing more than a circus.

33:07.490 --> 33:08.990
It's a... it's a...

33:08.990 --> 33:12.020
It's a showcase trial
for Mr. stone,

33:12.030 --> 33:14.590
a small man who will do
whatever he can

33:14.600 --> 33:17.030
to bring down a...

33:17.030 --> 33:18.530
- Please finish that thought,
Mr. linden.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.000
- Well, I'm not one to boast.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.200
- Well, let me.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.040
You were gonna say a great man.

33:23.040 --> 33:26.170
- Well, look, I employ
thousands of people.

33:26.170 --> 33:28.640
I have hundreds
of commercial tenants,

33:28.640 --> 33:31.710
corporate offices of some of
the best companies in the world.

33:31.710 --> 33:34.180
I have thousands
of residential tenants,

33:34.180 --> 33:35.480
good people, by the way.

33:35.480 --> 33:37.620
Good upstanding people.

33:37.620 --> 33:40.920
I fund the... the linden center
for cancer research

33:40.920 --> 33:42.660
at St. Vincent's.

33:42.660 --> 33:45.190
The opera wouldn't be able
to finish its season

33:45.190 --> 33:47.060
if I didn't cover its shortfall.

33:47.060 --> 33:49.560
I mean, I can go on
and on and on and on.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.530
I... I think we get the picture.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.200
- The fact that Mr. stone,

33:53.200 --> 33:55.670
because of some
personal vendetta,

33:55.670 --> 33:58.100
or... or impotent ambition,

33:58.110 --> 33:59.740
or whatever it is that
gets him up in the morning,

33:59.740 --> 34:05.110
chooses to accuse me
of killing my son-in-law,

34:05.110 --> 34:08.010
my son, as far as I'm concerned,

34:08.020 --> 34:10.150
it's a clear example of...
Of the pettiness

34:10.150 --> 34:13.090
and the deterioration
of a legal system...

34:13.090 --> 34:16.520
Excuse me... that we are
supposed to be relying on.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.590
- Did you have anything
whatsoever to do

34:18.590 --> 34:20.690
with sabotaging
the riverfront site?

34:20.699 --> 34:23.000
- Absolutely nothing.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.060
- Thank you, Mr. linden.

34:32.170 --> 34:34.139
You received your MBA
from Columbia, didn't you?

34:34.139 --> 34:36.040
- I did.

34:36.040 --> 34:38.610
- Do you remember the subject
of your master's thesis?

34:38.610 --> 34:41.110
- Well, it was 30 years ago.
No, I don't.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.219
- It's a good thing
I have a copy.

34:43.219 --> 34:45.050
It's called
"in defense of pinto."

34:45.050 --> 34:48.150
- Objection, relevance.
- Overruled.

34:48.159 --> 34:49.790
- Where... where did you get that?

34:49.790 --> 34:51.620
- It's my job to ask
the questions, sir,

34:51.630 --> 34:53.260
but since your memory
seems to be failing...

34:53.260 --> 34:55.159
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

34:55.159 --> 34:57.800
I'd be more than happy
to refresh your recollection.

34:57.800 --> 34:59.830
It seems you published it
20 years ago

34:59.830 --> 35:02.800
in a journal called the "real
estate investor's quarterly."

35:02.800 --> 35:06.070
Do you remember who owned
the journal at that time?

35:06.070 --> 35:07.570
- I owned it.

35:07.580 --> 35:09.610
- So you thought
you'd share your wisdom

35:09.610 --> 35:12.280
with the rest of the industry?
- It was a legitimate treatise.

35:12.280 --> 35:14.150
- Has it ever been cited?

35:14.150 --> 35:15.750
- I don't know.
I wouldn't know.

35:15.750 --> 35:18.280
- I would.

35:18.290 --> 35:21.250
According to Lexisnexis,
the only time it was ever cited

35:21.260 --> 35:23.290
was in a book called
"negotiate up."

35:23.290 --> 35:26.290
Do you know who wrote that book?

35:26.290 --> 35:27.760
- Yes, I did.

35:27.760 --> 35:29.190
I can sign it for you,
if you like.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.660
- Looks like you might be
the only one

35:30.670 --> 35:32.300
to consider this treatise
legitimate.

35:32.300 --> 35:33.630
- Object...
- Don't bother, counsel.

35:33.630 --> 35:35.630
I withdraw the comment.

35:35.640 --> 35:37.800
Would you mind explaining for us
the subject of your thesis,

35:37.810 --> 35:41.610
that is, the pinto case,
to the jury?

35:41.610 --> 35:43.040
- Sure.

35:43.040 --> 35:46.310
Pinto was a 1981 lawsuit,

35:46.310 --> 35:49.650
in which Ford motor company
was determined to have used

35:49.650 --> 35:54.690
a cost-benefit analysis,
weighing the risk of human life

35:54.690 --> 35:56.760
against corporate profit.

35:56.760 --> 36:00.090
- And in your thesis,
you agreed with Ford.

36:00.090 --> 36:02.130
You argued it was appropriate
for a company

36:02.130 --> 36:04.660
to value profits
over human life.

36:04.670 --> 36:06.700
- Theoretically, yes.
- Not practically?

36:06.700 --> 36:08.600
- Well, uh, no.
I wouldn't know.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.170
- But theoretically,
sabotaging a particular project,

36:11.170 --> 36:14.070
if it boosted profits, would be
an acceptable business practice.

36:14.080 --> 36:15.720
That's... that's what you wrote,
isn't it?

36:17.110 --> 36:20.680
The point of business
is to create profit, okay?

36:20.680 --> 36:23.220
- So if a company could earn
an extra $10 million,

36:23.220 --> 36:25.280
it would be okay
if, say, one person

36:25.290 --> 36:28.350
became collateral damage?
- In theory.

36:28.360 --> 36:30.760
- Your paper says that
corporations have a duty

36:30.760 --> 36:33.290
to weigh risk to human life
against profits.

36:33.290 --> 36:35.390
I question the validity
of that theory,

36:35.400 --> 36:38.230
and you said it was
a legitimate treatise.

36:38.230 --> 36:40.230
Are you changing your answer?
- No, I'm not.

36:40.230 --> 36:42.170
- Of course not,

36:42.170 --> 36:45.700
because it was cited
by at least one noted scholar.

36:45.710 --> 36:47.410
Tell me, sir, under your theory,

36:47.410 --> 36:49.780
how many people have to be
put at risk of bodily harm

36:49.780 --> 36:51.240
before the corporation says,

36:51.250 --> 36:54.110
"stop, we have made
enough money"?

37:00.250 --> 37:01.950
There's no way to answer
that question.

37:01.960 --> 37:04.120
It's theory.
- Well, sure there is.

37:04.130 --> 37:06.390
It's right here
in your treatise.

37:06.390 --> 37:08.190
"When the cost of
defending lawsuits

37:08.200 --> 37:10.760
exceeds the company's
expected profit margins."

37:10.770 --> 37:12.330
That's what you wrote, isn't it?

37:12.330 --> 37:15.170
- If you say so.
- It's your words, not mine.

37:15.170 --> 37:16.870
And the insurance policy
on riverfront

37:16.870 --> 37:19.270
would've netted you
over half a billion dollars.

37:19.270 --> 37:20.440
- Objection.
- That's a lot more, I suspect,

37:20.440 --> 37:22.270
than it would cost to defend

37:22.280 --> 37:23.880
one of those pain-in-the-ass
wrongful death lawsuits.

37:23.880 --> 37:25.740
- Objection.
- Overruled.

37:25.750 --> 37:27.880
- I employ thousands
of people, okay?

37:27.880 --> 37:29.750
I have hundreds...
- it's profits.

37:29.750 --> 37:31.350
It's all about profits.

37:31.350 --> 37:34.220
- You're goddamn right it is!

37:39.160 --> 37:42.330
- even when the wrongful death
was that of your son-in-law?

37:44.300 --> 37:46.870
What if it was your son?

37:51.370 --> 37:52.740
Your daughter?

37:55.480 --> 37:59.780
- I employ thousands
of people, okay?

37:59.780 --> 38:02.010
I have hundreds
of commercial tenants...

38:02.020 --> 38:04.320
- that's all.

38:14.930 --> 38:16.400
- let's talk.

38:33.980 --> 38:37.350
- I agreed to talk... Alone.

38:37.350 --> 38:40.750
- My house, my rules,
Mr. linden.

38:40.760 --> 38:41.920
You called this meeting, Helen.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.060
- Without admitting any guilt,

38:43.060 --> 38:44.490
my client is open to a plea.

38:44.490 --> 38:45.490
- I'm listening.

38:45.490 --> 38:46.790
- Reckless endangerment.

38:46.790 --> 38:48.460
Two years probation.

38:51.770 --> 38:54.070
- He killed your husband.
What do you think, Sarah?

38:54.070 --> 38:55.530
I'll tell you what I think.

38:55.540 --> 38:58.500
I think manslaughter.
He does 15.

38:58.510 --> 38:59.840
- I'll give you Tomczak.

38:59.840 --> 39:01.410
- I'll take him.
12.

39:01.410 --> 39:03.080
- Okay, you know what,
screw this.

39:03.080 --> 39:05.840
I'll just... I'll just take
my chances with the jury.

39:05.850 --> 39:08.350
- It was her idea
to get the insurance.

39:11.350 --> 39:14.490
She's the one who convinced
Tomczak to freeze the boom pins.

39:16.360 --> 39:18.990
- You see that?
You see that?

39:18.990 --> 39:22.090
I had nothing to do with this!

39:22.100 --> 39:24.000
- Don't let him do this
to us, Brett...

39:24.000 --> 39:27.330
- Not now, Sarah.
- He killed Evan.

39:29.370 --> 39:31.800
He left Annaleigh
without a father.

39:31.810 --> 39:33.470
He'd gladly leave her
without a mother.

39:33.470 --> 39:35.570
- Who's going to
build things, Sarah?

39:35.580 --> 39:38.340
You? Me?

39:38.350 --> 39:39.880
Annaleigh?

39:39.880 --> 39:42.880
Don't you see?
We need him.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.120
We all do.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.890
- Well, I don't.

39:47.890 --> 39:49.420
There's no deal on the table
for any of you.

39:49.420 --> 39:50.560
You can tell that
to your buddy Tomczak

39:50.560 --> 39:52.020
and his errand boy Westin.

39:52.030 --> 39:54.360
I'm coming after all of you.

40:05.510 --> 40:07.570
- in the case of the people
of the state of Illinois

40:07.580 --> 40:09.440
versus frank linden,

40:09.440 --> 40:12.110
as to the sole count
of the indictment, murder,

40:12.110 --> 40:14.550
we find the defendant guilty.

40:48.510 --> 40:50.950
- linden's already looking
to reduce his sentence.

40:50.950 --> 40:52.950
- Oh, that doesn't surprise me.

40:52.950 --> 40:55.520
He's got a laundry list
of dirty secrets to trade.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.520
- Yeah, starting with his son.

40:57.520 --> 41:00.130
- That family's like
five of his businesses.

41:00.130 --> 41:02.630
Bankrupt.
- Strategically bankrupt.

41:04.630 --> 41:06.970
You two should have
another drink.

41:06.970 --> 41:08.930
If I'm correct,

41:08.940 --> 41:11.070
you won't be coming back here
for awhile.

41:12.970 --> 41:15.640
That dirty laundry
I was talking about,

41:15.640 --> 41:19.180
most of it belongs to
our esteemed membership.
