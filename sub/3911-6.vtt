00:00.960 --> 00:02.760
Previously on
"Tyrant"

00:02.760 --> 00:04.628
[Ihab] The sons of Tal Jiza

00:04.630 --> 00:06.897
will become soldiers
in the Army of the Caliphate.

00:06.899 --> 00:08.565
Oh, shit.

00:08.567 --> 00:09.900
Please look after my sons.

00:09.902 --> 00:11.802
I'm not going with
the Caliphate. I have to leave.

00:11.804 --> 00:13.303
You ran away
 from your family.

00:13.305 --> 00:16.940
Now I ask you a favor,
you run away from me.

00:16.942 --> 00:18.241
If you want her, take her.

00:18.243 --> 00:19.242
No.

00:19.244 --> 00:20.577
- Bring her. 
- No.

00:20.579 --> 00:21.778
No!

00:21.780 --> 00:22.913
Meet Rami Said.

00:22.915 --> 00:24.281
Rami, this is my wife, 
Leila.

00:24.283 --> 00:25.649
How do you two know
 each other?

00:25.651 --> 00:26.917
He's your son.

00:26.919 --> 00:30.087
If you stay, I'll make you

00:30.089 --> 00:31.989
a very powerful man
 in the army.

00:31.991 --> 00:33.924
I need to leave now,
but thank you for the offer.

00:33.926 --> 00:35.759
[Timmons] <i>The legal team</i>

00:35.761 --> 00:38.428
representing the Al Fayeed trust
is contesting the will.

00:38.430 --> 00:40.931
You need to appear
 <i>in court,</i>

00:40.933 --> 00:42.666
<i>in Abuddin.</i>

00:42.668 --> 00:44.668
These men have come
to destroy my country.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.636
- I can't keep running anymore.
- But what will you do?

00:46.638 --> 00:49.399
[Barry] <i>Whatever God's
will allows me to do.</i>

00:51.944 --> 00:55.679
[reporter] After three days
of intense fighting

00:55.681 --> 00:57.447
and with its
military base overrun,

00:57.449 --> 00:59.016
- sources are today confirming
- [soldiers cheering]

00:59.018 --> 01:01.118
that the Abuddinian city

01:01.120 --> 01:04.120
of Ma'an has fallen
to the Caliphate.

01:04.123 --> 01:06.990
Government troops protecting
the Ma'an oil field

01:06.992 --> 01:08.125
were unable to stop

01:08.127 --> 01:09.860
the advance
 of the radical group

01:09.862 --> 01:13.163
now said to control
over 90% of the city while...

01:13.165 --> 01:14.631
[female reporter] And
 its new leader,

01:14.633 --> 01:17.701
self-proclaimed Emir of Abuddin,
Ihab Rashid.

01:18.030 --> 01:20.030
[grunts]

01:20.039 --> 01:21.705
[Ahmed] Two fighter jets,

01:21.707 --> 01:24.307
three attack choppers
and a cargo transporter

01:24.309 --> 01:26.470
destroyed or disabled
by their anti-aircraft.

01:26.470 --> 01:28.345
With what was seized
at the base,

01:28.347 --> 01:30.614
it amounts to roughly a third
of our air force.

01:36.055 --> 01:37.988
[Leila] Did you have
 anything to eat?

01:37.990 --> 01:40.357
I can have the kitchen
prepare something for you.

01:40.359 --> 01:42.426
I don't want anything.

01:44.420 --> 01:47.020
[hangs up receiver]

01:47.499 --> 01:49.332
Then you should at least
get some rest.

01:49.334 --> 01:51.401
Dr. Radwan can
prescribe you something.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.336
Stop haranguing me, Leila.

01:53.338 --> 01:56.239
You see what's happening,
what I'm dealing with.

01:56.241 --> 01:59.509
I'm meeting
 with the Chinese.

01:59.511 --> 02:03.547
Food and sleep are the least
of my concerns.

02:03.549 --> 02:06.016
Then you should at least
consider a shower

02:06.018 --> 02:08.752
and some fresh clothes.

02:08.949 --> 02:11.950
[footsteps departing]
[door opens]

02:15.260 --> 02:17.327
[sighs]

02:17.327 --> 02:19.320

02:20.365 --> 02:22.799
[indistinct chatter]

02:30.943 --> 02:33.009
[helicopter blades whirring]

02:34.000 --> 02:36.800
[rope creaking]

02:40.052 --> 02:41.952
No! No!

02:41.954 --> 02:43.620
Where are your people?

02:43.622 --> 02:46.623
[gasping] There's
 no one else.

02:47.090 --> 02:50.090
[gasping, panting]

02:50.095 --> 02:51.461
We know your

02:51.463 --> 02:53.263
Banu Zahra clan is still
giving us trouble,

02:53.265 --> 02:55.732
- so I'll ask you again.
- [man groaning]

02:55.734 --> 02:57.901
Where are they hiding?
[electricity buzzing]

02:57.903 --> 02:59.469
[groaning]

02:59.469 --> 03:01.460
[breathing heavily]

03:03.775 --> 03:05.442
[buzzing continues]

03:05.444 --> 03:06.977
No.

03:08.113 --> 03:09.679
[groaning]

03:09.679 --> 03:11.283
[whimpering]

03:11.283 --> 03:13.683
[electricity buzzing]
[screaming]

03:16.288 --> 03:19.656
[groans, gasping]

03:22.460 --> 03:24.463
[pain continues]

03:24.463 --> 03:26.663
You have all my people.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.598
[crying]

03:28.600 --> 03:30.634
The rest are with Allah.

03:30.636 --> 03:32.936
Cheer up.

03:32.938 --> 03:35.338
You'll be reunited
with them tomorrow

03:35.340 --> 03:37.007
when we hang you.

03:38.110 --> 03:40.977
That's more than
 enough time

03:40.979 --> 03:42.612
time for Uthal
 to get the truth.

03:42.614 --> 03:45.174
[soldier] Abu Omar.

03:47.452 --> 03:49.319
You have been gone
 for days.

03:49.321 --> 03:50.787
Tell me you have
 something.

03:50.789 --> 03:51.955
We found Faisel.

03:51.957 --> 03:53.356
He and his man are dead.

03:54.793 --> 03:56.626
That Khalil who kidnapped
Faisel's wife,

03:56.628 --> 03:57.794
he did this?

03:57.796 --> 03:59.863
We think so.

03:59.865 --> 04:02.165
- Something else. 
- Uh-huh?

04:02.167 --> 04:04.501
Faisel's hand was
 cut off,

04:04.503 --> 04:07.170
but it's not
 with the bodies.

04:07.172 --> 04:09.372
[Ihab] <i>You have all been
 cheated</i>

04:09.374 --> 04:13.343
for far too long from
refinery managers

04:13.345 --> 04:15.245
who collaborated
with the Al Fayeeds.

04:19.317 --> 04:20.817
From now on,

04:20.819 --> 04:24.654
the workers will get 20 cents
on the dollar.

04:24.656 --> 04:27.457
[cheering]

04:27.457 --> 04:28.894
[applause]

04:28.894 --> 04:30.560
This won't do any good, Baba.
[applause]

04:30.562 --> 04:33.396
I have to try to
reason with him.

04:33.398 --> 04:34.831
Good work.

04:34.833 --> 04:36.233
[Ahmos] With
 utmost respect,

04:36.235 --> 04:38.668
I appeal to your mercy

04:38.670 --> 04:41.871
- and your sense of justice.
- [worker in distance] Go. Let's go.

04:41.873 --> 04:43.974
You heard him.
Let's go. Let's move.

04:48.540 --> 04:50.549
[people murmuring]

04:50.549 --> 04:55.185
Abu Omar has claimed
my wife, Daliyah,

04:55.187 --> 04:57.387
as his own.

04:57.389 --> 05:00.590
She is, by all rights,
still mine.

05:03.895 --> 05:07.697
Please... 
accept this money

05:07.699 --> 05:09.032
in return for her.

05:09.034 --> 05:11.067
It may not seem
 much to you,

05:11.069 --> 05:13.536
but this is all the money
I have in the world.

05:13.538 --> 05:15.605
I can get more, if
that's what it takes.

05:15.607 --> 05:17.607
Please take it.

05:19.578 --> 05:23.913
Please give me back
 my Daliyah.

05:23.915 --> 05:27.450
Your wife is safe with us.

05:29.054 --> 05:32.455
Abu Omar is simply
reeducating her

05:32.457 --> 05:34.958
on how she can
 best serve Allah.

05:36.061 --> 05:37.927
So keep your money.

05:37.929 --> 05:40.063
You're going to need it
to rebuild your village,

05:40.065 --> 05:41.398
rebuild your home.
 Keep it.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.400
You already have
my two oldest sons,

05:43.402 --> 05:45.468
Munir and Kasim,

05:45.470 --> 05:48.104
fighting for you,
 loyal to you.

05:48.106 --> 05:50.106
But my youngest, Ghani,

05:50.108 --> 05:51.608
he still needs his mother.

05:51.610 --> 05:52.809
[Kasim] Father.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.646
You heard him.

05:56.648 --> 05:58.715
You have to go.

05:59.751 --> 06:01.951
Your wife, she's...

06:01.953 --> 06:03.420
she's serving
a higher cause now.

06:03.422 --> 06:07.891
Kasim, you know
 this is wrong.

06:08.927 --> 06:10.994
Come on. Come.

06:12.931 --> 06:14.931
Father, please,
 just go, okay?

06:14.933 --> 06:19.002
Please, just... 
Okay? Just go.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
[people chattering indistinctly]

06:43.128 --> 06:44.694
What are you after?

06:44.696 --> 06:46.629
Money? Take it!
[sack thuds]

06:46.631 --> 06:48.465
- It's all I have!
- It's me.

06:48.467 --> 06:50.200
- Khalil?
- Let's go.

06:50.969 --> 06:52.302
Come on.

06:52.304 --> 06:53.970
I've been in the
city for three days.

06:53.972 --> 06:57.173
I was beginning to think
I wouldn't find you.

06:57.175 --> 06:59.242
But you ran away.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.545
I thought 
this wasn't my fight.

07:04.816 --> 07:06.716
But I was wrong.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.319
I have to find the resistance.

07:09.321 --> 07:12.322
So, not a coward after
all, then, huh?

07:12.324 --> 07:13.990
[chuckles]

07:13.992 --> 07:15.992
But you're not a soldier,
either, Khalil, are you?

07:15.994 --> 07:17.994
Who are you?

07:17.996 --> 07:20.730
Really.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.667
Someone who's tired of running
from this place.

07:24.669 --> 07:27.303
I spent too much of my life
doing that.

07:29.074 --> 07:33.009
I'm joining my cousins
in the east of the city,

07:33.011 --> 07:35.044
the Banu Zahra clan.

07:35.046 --> 07:37.847
They're putting up
the biggest fight.

07:37.849 --> 07:39.616
I can take you to them.
[scraping dirt in background]

07:39.616 --> 07:41.186
[scraping dirt in background]

07:41.186 --> 07:45.021
Ahmos, I promise I'll do
whatever I can here.

07:45.023 --> 07:47.257
Go back to your village.

07:47.259 --> 07:48.892
Go back to 
Nasrin and Ghani.

07:48.894 --> 07:51.928
How can I return to Ghani
without his mother?

07:51.930 --> 07:54.364
No.

07:54.366 --> 07:58.268
I'm not leaving this city
without her.

08:00.260 --> 08:03.370
[shovel scraping]

08:03.375 --> 08:05.442
[woman sobbing]

08:06.411 --> 08:08.878
This is a temporary setback.

08:08.880 --> 08:13.783
Our army can retake
Ma'an, I assure you.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.618
Like you assured me
this man, Rashid,

08:15.620 --> 08:17.921
would be caught
after my wife was shot?

08:17.923 --> 08:19.556
Like you assured me

08:19.558 --> 08:21.591
he would never reach
the oil refinery

08:21.593 --> 08:22.725
he now controls?

08:22.727 --> 08:24.894
He won't be able
 to hold it,

08:24.896 --> 08:28.398
not if your country gives us
the weapons we need,

08:28.400 --> 08:31.234
and which you are obligated
to provide.

08:31.236 --> 08:32.735
We have no such obligation.

08:32.736 --> 08:35.472
[Tariq] Actually,
 you do, Ambassador.

08:35.474 --> 08:37.140
Per the terms
 of our treaty,

08:37.142 --> 08:40.076
China would provide us
J-20 fighter jets,

08:40.078 --> 08:42.645
WZ-551 armored
assault vehicles...

08:42.647 --> 08:45.915
All I'm asking
 is an advance.

08:45.917 --> 08:47.617
Those terms

08:47.619 --> 08:49.252
were defined
 as military support

08:49.254 --> 08:50.487
to protect your borders

08:50.489 --> 08:52.088
against foreign threats.

08:52.090 --> 08:54.657
My government refuses
to be drawn

08:54.659 --> 08:55.992
into your civil war.

08:55.994 --> 08:58.495
These are
 foreign invaders.

08:58.497 --> 09:01.931
And we have a signed
defense pact.

09:01.933 --> 09:05.435
Contingent upon you holding
your country together.

09:05.437 --> 09:06.836
Maybe gassing your citizens

09:06.838 --> 09:10.006
isn't the best way
to go about this.

09:15.647 --> 09:18.314
You dare to play

09:18.316 --> 09:21.518
the human rights card with me,
you puppet?

09:23.522 --> 09:25.855
Look to your own country
for that.

09:25.857 --> 09:28.224
We are done here.

09:33.460 --> 09:35.467
[door opens]

09:35.467 --> 09:38.468
Jamal, you need to go
 after him.

09:38.470 --> 09:40.970
You must apologize to him.
[door slams]

09:40.972 --> 09:42.772
Jamal.

09:42.772 --> 09:44.770
[exhales]

09:44.976 --> 09:48.344
Jamal, you need
to go after them.

09:48.346 --> 09:50.313
Without the Chinese,

09:50.315 --> 09:52.348
we don't have the men
to retake Ma'an.

09:52.350 --> 09:55.151
Not without redeploying troops
needed to stem the spread

09:55.153 --> 09:57.987
of the Caliphate
 in the north.

09:57.989 --> 10:01.658
You expect them to clean up
this mess you've made?

10:01.660 --> 10:06.829
I warned you not
 to use the gas.

10:06.831 --> 10:10.233
Your arrogance
 has doomed us.

10:10.235 --> 10:13.069
No oil, no alliances.

10:13.071 --> 10:16.205
You don't get to lay this
at my feet, Jamal.

10:16.207 --> 10:19.676
Not after murdering dozens
of my senior staff.

10:19.678 --> 10:21.544
And now you demand to know
why our troops

10:21.546 --> 10:24.547
are ill equipped
to fight our enemies?

10:24.549 --> 10:27.417
Bassam knew
 this was coming.

10:27.419 --> 10:31.054
Again... you let
your brother's words

10:31.056 --> 10:32.922
fill your head.

10:32.924 --> 10:36.159
If you insist on
listening to dead men...

10:37.929 --> 10:39.596
listen to your father.

10:39.598 --> 10:42.158
He knew what
 needed to be done.

10:47.372 --> 10:49.439
So do I.

10:54.212 --> 10:55.945
[sighs]

10:55.947 --> 10:58.848
Uncle... [groans]

[Ahmed] Stop!

11:13.765 --> 11:16.299
[panting]

11:20.271 --> 11:25.208
You are relieved of
your command, General.

11:36.020 --> 11:38.823
[door opens]

11:38.823 --> 11:40.890
[sighs]
[door closes]

11:40.890 --> 11:42.890
[takes a deep breath]

12:34.090 --> 12:38.850
Tyrant S02E06
"The Other Brother"

12:39.950 --> 12:47.950
Sync and corrected by
Gianluca Belfiglio

12:53.860 --> 12:55.867
[water splashing, dripping]

12:55.867 --> 12:57.867
[sighs]

12:57.869 --> 13:01.437
[ringtone playing]

13:08.513 --> 13:10.680
[sniffs]

13:10.682 --> 13:11.848
Yes?

13:11.850 --> 13:13.049
Hello?

13:13.051 --> 13:14.484
Ahmed, it...
it's Sammy.

13:16.421 --> 13:17.587
I'm at, I'm at
 the courthouse.

13:17.589 --> 13:18.921
I've been...

13:20.358 --> 13:22.024
waiting to see the judge

13:22.026 --> 13:23.359
about my inheritance.

13:23.361 --> 13:25.027
That has nothing to do
 with me.

13:25.029 --> 13:27.897
What are you doing
calling me like this?

13:27.899 --> 13:31.267
I'm forbidden from having
contact with any of you.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.269
I need your help.

13:33.271 --> 13:34.871
We have nothing
 to talk about.

13:34.873 --> 13:36.272
I'm hanging up.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.207
No, no, no, wait, wait,
look, look, I'm...

13:38.209 --> 13:40.209
I'm not calling
 about that. I...

13:40.211 --> 13:43.212
I'm trying to find Abdul.

13:43.214 --> 13:46.249
He's somewhere in Ma'an,
and I... I can't reach him.

13:46.251 --> 13:47.550
I'm worried about him.

13:47.552 --> 13:49.786
Can you help me
 find him?

13:49.788 --> 13:52.088
[sighs]

13:52.090 --> 13:54.390
We're still cousins.

13:54.392 --> 13:57.126
We're family. We're supposed
to be here for each other.

13:58.229 --> 14:00.296
[sighs]

14:02.960 --> 14:05.730
I haven't spoken
with him since he left Asima.

14:05.737 --> 14:07.270
But I know someone
 who may have.

14:07.272 --> 14:08.805
Text me when you're finished.

14:08.805 --> 14:10.800
[clicks, line beeping]

14:10.800 --> 14:12.800
[sighing]

14:13.244 --> 14:15.645
Did you reach your
friend, Abdul?

14:15.647 --> 14:18.614
Uh, left another message.

14:18.616 --> 14:20.249
I know you're worried,

14:20.251 --> 14:22.084
but I'm sure he got
out of Ma'an in time.

14:22.086 --> 14:23.286
- Yeah. 
- [Timmons] Good news.

14:23.288 --> 14:24.754
Our case made
 today's docket.

14:24.756 --> 14:26.422
Took a few days.

14:26.424 --> 14:28.344
Looks like we're finally
going in.

14:29.093 --> 14:30.493
Uh, how soon?

14:30.495 --> 14:32.795
We're up next.

14:32.797 --> 14:33.996
Great.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.732
Catch up with you
 in a second.

14:36.732 --> 14:39.730
[indistinct words from TV broadcast]

14:40.670 --> 14:42.674
[people cheering]

14:42.674 --> 14:43.940
Whatever happens
in that courtroom,

14:43.942 --> 14:44.974
we need to give some
serious thought

14:44.976 --> 14:46.442
to getting out of here

14:46.444 --> 14:47.677
before they start
closing the airports.

14:47.679 --> 14:49.145
We're not going
 anywhere

14:49.147 --> 14:51.347
- till Sammy gets his inheritance.
- [Timmons exhales deeply]

14:51.349 --> 14:54.183
I won't be chased out,
not again.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.886
So, pressure's on me, then.

15:00.124 --> 15:03.492
[Jamal] What do you mean
Burkina Faso can't authorize

15:03.494 --> 15:04.794
an arms shipment?

15:04.796 --> 15:07.129
Aren't you
 Defense Minister?

15:07.131 --> 15:09.031
No, you listen to me.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.801
Hello? Hello?

15:11.803 --> 15:14.700
[screams] Oh, God!
[sound echoing]

15:23.648 --> 15:25.715
[footsteps approaching]

15:27.886 --> 15:29.652
[Amira] I just heard
 what Jamal did.

15:29.654 --> 15:31.654
[sighs] Save your
 false tears.

15:31.656 --> 15:34.323
You never liked Tariq.

15:34.325 --> 15:36.359
It's my son
 I'm worried about.

15:36.361 --> 15:38.327
What happened?

15:38.329 --> 15:40.162
I couldn't say.

15:40.164 --> 15:42.231
I wasn't there.

15:43.735 --> 15:46.736
I wasn't there.

15:47.872 --> 15:50.039
He's not sleeping.

15:50.041 --> 15:52.842
He's been taking some kind
of pills, amphetamines,

15:52.844 --> 15:55.544
which are only
making him paranoid.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.750
And now,

16:00.752 --> 16:03.819
our Chinese partners
have abandoned us.

16:06.691 --> 16:08.758
We're alone.

16:09.894 --> 16:11.961
And you knew
 this would happen.

16:13.231 --> 16:15.298
Leila?

16:16.734 --> 16:20.569
Whatever else we think
about each other,

16:20.571 --> 16:22.872
we both desire
the safety of our family

16:22.874 --> 16:25.434
and the preservation
of this regime.

16:27.211 --> 16:29.779
Jamal...

16:29.781 --> 16:33.749
is not the military leader
that his father was,

16:33.751 --> 16:36.886
which is why I tried to bring
in someone who might be.

16:36.888 --> 16:39.221
Jamal's bastard
is not setting foot

16:39.223 --> 16:42.058
in this house again.

16:42.060 --> 16:44.560
Rami may very possibly be
our only chance

16:44.562 --> 16:46.128
for survival.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.397
He's only here for
two more hours

16:48.399 --> 16:50.066
before he flies out
 to Burundi.

16:50.068 --> 16:52.234
So put aside
 your objections

16:52.236 --> 16:54.236
and your dislike of me

16:54.238 --> 16:56.158
and listen to what
I have to say.

16:59.243 --> 17:02.411
[Timmons] Khaled Al Fayeed's will
was never executed.

17:02.413 --> 17:05.146
Um, Bassam's inheritance
remains in trust.

17:05.148 --> 17:08.818
The Al Fayeeds are refusing to
release the money in the trust

17:08.819 --> 17:12.121
to my client because
of alleged actions

17:12.123 --> 17:15.090
taken by his father
months after the fact.

17:15.093 --> 17:16.592
He should not have...

17:16.594 --> 17:20.262
[Judge] These actions were not
simply alleged.

17:20.263 --> 17:22.798
He was tried and convicted
for his crimes

17:22.800 --> 17:24.767
and executed as a traitor.

17:24.769 --> 17:26.167
I'm not here to dispute that.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.435
I can only submit

17:27.438 --> 17:28.771
that the sins of the father,

17:28.773 --> 17:30.139
treason or otherwise,

17:30.141 --> 17:31.474
should have no bearing
on what is legally

17:31.476 --> 17:34.076
this young man's property.

17:35.313 --> 17:37.380
I should like to hear
from Sammy.

17:37.380 --> 17:40.380
[siren wailing in distance]

17:42.954 --> 17:46.288
You agree with everything that
is being said on your behalf,

17:46.290 --> 17:50.192
that you are not responsible
for what your father did?

17:51.195 --> 17:52.795
Yes, sir.

17:52.797 --> 17:55.297
So you did not share
your father's desire

17:55.299 --> 17:57.666
to overthrow
our sovereign government,

17:57.668 --> 18:00.202
then or now?

18:00.204 --> 18:01.871
No.

18:01.873 --> 18:03.472
You renounce your father?

18:03.474 --> 18:05.307
You see him
for the traitor he was?

18:05.309 --> 18:10.379
He was deluded
 and selfish.

18:10.381 --> 18:12.314
I mean, thinking he
could just come in

18:12.316 --> 18:14.216
and change a foreign
country's ways.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.551
- That's...
- [Judge] I'd like to hear you

18:15.553 --> 18:18.487
say the words.

18:18.489 --> 18:21.724
"I renounce my father,
Bassam Al Fayeed."

18:21.726 --> 18:22.992
Excuse me,
why is this necessary?

18:22.994 --> 18:24.226
Molly.

18:30.334 --> 18:32.802
[Judge] I'd like to hear
you say the words.

18:42.513 --> 18:47.750
I renounce my father,
Bassam Al Fayeed.

18:49.353 --> 18:51.087
[Molly] <i>James, what the hell
was that in there?</i>

18:51.089 --> 18:53.355
Making him
 renounce his father?

18:53.357 --> 18:55.357
The price you pay looking
for justice

18:55.359 --> 18:57.259
in a dictatorship, I guess.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.061
Now we just have to
hope he comes back

18:59.063 --> 19:00.362
with a favorable ruling.

19:00.364 --> 19:02.031
You did well in there,
 Sammy.

19:02.033 --> 19:03.365
Thanks.

19:03.367 --> 19:04.867
Honey, that was awful.

19:04.869 --> 19:06.735
I'm so sorry he put you
in that position.

19:06.737 --> 19:08.804
Well, I didn't have to lie.

19:10.800 --> 19:13.800
[traffic noise]
[car engine roaring]

19:13.800 --> 19:16.300
[vehicle approaching]
[brakes squealing]

19:16.610 --> 19:18.616
[engine revving]

19:18.616 --> 19:20.116
What is he doing here?

19:20.118 --> 19:22.284
He's here for me.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.586
What?
What are you talking about?

19:23.588 --> 19:25.287
He's, uh, gonna help me
find Abdul.

19:25.289 --> 19:27.723
No. No, no, listen.

19:27.725 --> 19:29.125
I get that you're worried
about your friend,

19:29.127 --> 19:30.459
but you are not going anywhere
with him.

19:30.461 --> 19:32.394
- [Molly] That family murdered your father.
- [Sammy] No, no.

19:32.396 --> 19:34.296
That was Uncle Jamal, 
not Ahmed.

19:34.298 --> 19:37.733
Sins of the father
can't be blamed on his children.

19:37.735 --> 19:38.901
Right?

19:38.903 --> 19:40.102
Sammy.

19:40.104 --> 19:42.404
- [softly] Mom.
- Sammy.

19:42.406 --> 19:44.974
[engine revving]

19:51.580 --> 19:54.585
[vehicle departing]

19:54.585 --> 19:56.652
[sighs]

20:00.925 --> 20:02.258
Thanks for coming.

20:02.260 --> 20:03.659
So, where are we going?

20:03.661 --> 20:04.994
Uncle Yaser.

20:04.996 --> 20:06.829
Who?

20:07.965 --> 20:09.965
This old queen. [chuckles]

20:09.967 --> 20:11.934
[chuckles]

20:11.936 --> 20:15.604
I don't remember
his last name, but...

20:15.606 --> 20:18.307
I ran into him a couple
of times with Abdul.

20:18.309 --> 20:19.975
Abdul said he was
his uncle, but...

20:19.977 --> 20:22.011
[smacks lips] I knew better.

20:22.013 --> 20:23.479
[chuckles]

20:23.481 --> 20:25.814
What?

20:25.816 --> 20:27.950
You think I didn't know
what Abdul was?

20:27.952 --> 20:29.952
I always knew.

20:29.954 --> 20:33.656
I'm not one to condemn others
for what God made them,

20:33.658 --> 20:36.218
especially not those
closest to me.

20:37.128 --> 20:39.461
He comanages a nightclub

20:39.463 --> 20:41.797
for men like Abdul.

20:41.799 --> 20:44.633
We can start there.

20:44.635 --> 20:46.969
You're coming with me?

20:46.971 --> 20:49.038
I could use a break
from my father.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
[door opens]

21:03.321 --> 21:05.154
May I come in?

21:05.156 --> 21:07.957
Of course.

21:12.330 --> 21:15.333
[indistinct words from TV broadcast]

21:15.333 --> 21:18.067
I see you're getting ready
to leave.

21:19.370 --> 21:22.204
Yes.

21:22.206 --> 21:25.608
Although I imagine my leaving
isn't entirely disappointing.

21:27.378 --> 21:31.013
The very fact of me must
be complicated for you.

21:31.015 --> 21:33.749
Why would you say that?

21:43.527 --> 21:46.762
My husband
 is not a general.

21:46.764 --> 21:49.231
My son, God bless him,
is not one either.

21:49.233 --> 21:52.201
I understand your work
in Africa involved negotiating

21:52.203 --> 21:55.037
with arms dealers,
 mercenaries.

21:55.039 --> 21:57.706
We need weapons.

21:57.708 --> 21:59.575
We need experienced soldiers
to train our troops

21:59.577 --> 22:01.977
and a general
 to lead them.

22:02.913 --> 22:05.381
My husband
 will only trust you.

22:05.383 --> 22:08.550
I need you to stay.

22:08.552 --> 22:12.721
I appreciate your confidence
in me, but I have a job.

22:12.723 --> 22:14.890
Troops are awaiting
for me to return to them,

22:14.892 --> 22:19.295
and this,
 this is not my fight.

22:19.297 --> 22:20.629
This <i> is</i> your fight.

22:20.631 --> 22:23.766
Those people dying in
Ma'an are our people.

22:23.768 --> 22:25.567
The Caliphate is your enemy.

22:25.569 --> 22:27.469
I don't expect you
to understand this...

22:27.471 --> 22:29.071
You haven't lived my life...

22:29.073 --> 22:30.739
But everything that's happened
to me thus far

22:30.741 --> 22:32.775
has made it easier for me
to be someplace else,

22:32.777 --> 22:34.810
anywhere but the place
I was born.

22:34.812 --> 22:39.248
"Easier." You're right,
I don't understand.

22:39.250 --> 22:40.949
This is your country.

22:40.951 --> 22:42.284
No.

22:42.286 --> 22:43.652
And who's privileged

22:43.654 --> 22:45.788
to choose
 where they're from?

22:45.790 --> 22:47.256
However far you want
to run away,

22:47.258 --> 22:49.258
you will always be
 from Abuddin.

22:49.260 --> 22:51.827
Mrs. Al Fayeed,
there is no point to this.

22:51.829 --> 22:53.462
Fine, say whatever
you want to say.

22:53.464 --> 22:57.299
This is not your country,
but neither is Burundi

22:57.301 --> 22:59.935
or half the countries
you run off to protect.

22:59.937 --> 23:02.104
You want to save the world?

23:02.106 --> 23:03.772
Start here.

23:03.774 --> 23:07.142
Save my people,
save your grandmother's people.

23:07.144 --> 23:09.244
Save your
 mother's people.

23:11.240 --> 23:14.240
[engine revving]

23:14.240 --> 23:15.653
[tires screeching]

23:15.653 --> 23:17.653
Careful not to use
your real name.

23:17.655 --> 23:19.355
Why?

23:19.357 --> 23:20.956
My father's become
such a hero...

23:20.958 --> 23:22.691
You're an Al Fayeed.

23:22.693 --> 23:24.460
The name cuts both ways.

23:24.462 --> 23:26.328
[chuckles]

23:26.330 --> 23:29.431
I'll wait here, make sure you
get back to your hotel safely.

23:29.431 --> 23:31.430
[engine roaring in background]

23:37.970 --> 23:39.970
[door window rolls open]

23:40.978 --> 23:43.345
Looking for Yaser.

23:43.347 --> 23:45.414
I'm a friend of Abdul.

23:45.414 --> 23:47.410
[door window slams]

23:49.410 --> 23:53.410
[door lock clicks]
[hinges squeaking]

23:58.160 --> 24:01.165
[hinges squeaking resumes]

24:01.165 --> 24:03.232
[door closes]

24:03.232 --> 24:07.230
[footsteps tapping]

24:14.178 --> 24:16.245
I'm Yaser.

24:17.548 --> 24:20.015
It's a vigil.

24:20.017 --> 24:22.084
For the Ma'an Nine.

24:28.392 --> 24:31.226
[whispering] What's that?

24:31.228 --> 24:33.061
During the fighting
 in Ma'an,

24:33.063 --> 24:36.532
nine men took refuge
in a closed nightclub,

24:36.534 --> 24:39.034
much like this one.

24:39.036 --> 24:43.372
The Caliphate found
them, rounded them up.

24:43.374 --> 24:44.773
Abdul?

24:44.775 --> 24:47.810
Was he one of the men
in... in the nightclub?

24:49.380 --> 24:50.746
He was.

24:50.748 --> 24:55.651
I received a text from him
shortly before they...

24:57.221 --> 24:59.588
I'm sorry.

24:59.590 --> 25:01.423
Is he dead?

25:01.425 --> 25:03.792
I heard they were
in prison somewhere, but,

25:03.794 --> 25:07.062
uh, it's only
a matter of time

25:07.064 --> 25:09.064
before he's executed.

25:09.066 --> 25:11.533
Well, what's being done?

25:12.630 --> 25:16.270
No... there's something
we can do,

25:16.270 --> 25:18.200
I mean... [breathing heavily]
wh... what can we do?

25:18.200 --> 25:20.809
There's nothing
that can be done.

25:20.811 --> 25:25.013
You can't reason
with vicious dogs.

25:26.250 --> 25:28.083
That's not true.

25:28.085 --> 25:29.451
They ransom hostages
 sometimes.

25:29.453 --> 25:30.919
On occasion.

25:30.921 --> 25:33.922
But not for people
 like us.

25:33.924 --> 25:36.925
We are abominations
 to them.

25:36.927 --> 25:38.994
No human value.

25:41.932 --> 25:43.932
What if it's a lot of money?

25:43.934 --> 25:46.368
[scoffs] Sweet boy.

25:48.772 --> 25:50.772
You'd need a fortune.

25:50.774 --> 25:52.608
Millions.

25:52.610 --> 25:55.410
More than a child
like you could afford.

25:57.450 --> 25:59.450
[sighs]

25:59.450 --> 26:01.517
I might be able
 to afford a lot.

26:04.955 --> 26:07.022
This is the street.

26:09.994 --> 26:11.827
They've hit the mosque.

26:11.829 --> 26:14.363
[Barry] They must have been
overrun during the night.

26:16.467 --> 26:18.534
This is the house.

26:19.300 --> 26:21.305
[insect buzzing]

26:21.305 --> 26:23.672
[Ahmos] This is Nadia,
my cousin's daughter.

26:23.674 --> 26:26.475
She's barely 17.

26:26.477 --> 26:28.677
[sniffles]

26:28.679 --> 26:31.513
[sobbing gently] Why?

26:31.515 --> 26:33.582
I'm sorry, Ahmos.

26:33.582 --> 26:35.580
[Ahmos sighs deeply]

26:41.492 --> 26:42.824
[guns cock]

26:42.826 --> 26:44.192
[woman] Don't move.

26:44.194 --> 26:45.727
Who are you?

26:45.720 --> 26:48.198
[Ahmos panting]

26:48.198 --> 26:50.165
I'm looking for family.

26:50.167 --> 26:51.233
[woman] There's
 no family here.

26:51.235 --> 26:54.102
[Ahmos] I am a cousin 
to Banu Zahra.

26:57.575 --> 27:00.075
Uncle Ahmos?

27:03.247 --> 27:04.746
Ru'a, yeah?

27:08.352 --> 27:10.719
He's a friend, Khalil.

27:10.721 --> 27:14.456
He came to help
fight the Caliphate.

27:16.427 --> 27:19.261
Your timing is for shit.

27:19.263 --> 27:21.330
[speaks in Arabic]

27:29.873 --> 27:31.273
Where is everybody else?

27:32.576 --> 27:34.576
Dragged away.

27:34.578 --> 27:36.411
Siddiq had us hide
in our grain cellar

27:36.413 --> 27:38.880
when they couldn't hold
them off any longer.

27:38.882 --> 27:43.051
What about the, um...
the rest of the resistance?

27:43.053 --> 27:45.420
I told you.

27:45.422 --> 27:47.489
[sniffles] No one is left.

27:51.480 --> 27:54.480
[sighs, sobbing]

28:03.040 --> 28:05.807
[Jane] You need
to clean yourself up.

28:05.809 --> 28:07.142
Abu Omar
 will be home soon.

28:08.412 --> 28:10.245
He finally gets to rest.

28:10.247 --> 28:12.247
It's up to us
 to please him.

28:12.249 --> 28:15.350
Up to you, not to me.

28:17.921 --> 28:19.921
You belong to
 Abu Omar now.

28:19.923 --> 28:22.591
You will obey him,

28:22.593 --> 28:25.961
do what he wants
whenever he wants it.

28:25.963 --> 28:29.965
And when I speak,
I speak with his voice.

28:29.967 --> 28:34.403
Any disrespect you show me,
he will know.

28:37.675 --> 28:39.675
I'm curious.

28:39.677 --> 28:44.479
What twisted path brought
a pathetic Western whore

28:44.481 --> 28:47.315
to think that she could
come to my country

28:47.317 --> 28:51.386
and dictate to me her perverted
misinterpretations of the Koran?

28:53.290 --> 28:55.850
Did your parents
not love you enough?

28:56.960 --> 28:59.520
Is that why you lay
with murderers?

28:59.520 --> 29:01.520
[slapping sound]
[Daliyah gasps]

29:07.171 --> 29:09.171
Is that why you stood by

29:09.173 --> 29:11.373
while the people of this house
were slaughtered?

29:13.644 --> 29:16.712
So you could sleep in their bed
and call it your own?

29:18.649 --> 29:21.717
Finish your cleaning
before Abu Omar gets here.

29:25.055 --> 29:27.556
[Rami] <i>I'm going
 to need every one</i>

29:27.558 --> 29:30.325
of those arms and aircraft
on the list, Solomon.

29:30.327 --> 29:33.328
Talk to your associates
and make it happen.

29:33.330 --> 29:35.530
Men like them, they move
at their own pace.

29:35.532 --> 29:38.366
But I'll do what I can to get
some shipped out with us.

29:38.368 --> 29:42.838
Monsieur, how many military
advisors will you be bringing?

29:42.840 --> 29:46.742
As many as you can pay for,
Mr. President.

29:48.212 --> 29:50.212
I'll have the money wired
to you within the hour.

29:50.214 --> 29:52.280
[clears throat]

29:52.280 --> 29:54.218
[smooches]

29:54.218 --> 29:56.718
Abuddin owes you for this.

29:56.720 --> 29:59.721
The people are desperate
for good news,

29:59.723 --> 30:03.024
and now I have something to
announce in my address tomorrow.

30:03.026 --> 30:05.193
I'm sorry, Father.

30:05.195 --> 30:08.196
I just got the message
you were looking for me.

30:08.198 --> 30:10.298
Where have you been?

30:10.298 --> 30:11.702
[scoffs]

30:11.702 --> 30:13.702
I had some business
to take care of.

30:13.704 --> 30:15.070
Doesn't matter,
I'm happy you are here.

30:15.072 --> 30:16.071
Come.

30:16.073 --> 30:18.573
Meet our new general.

30:18.575 --> 30:21.643
[clears throat] This is,
 uh, Rami Said...

30:24.248 --> 30:25.781
your brother.

30:34.780 --> 30:36.560
[pounds on table]

30:36.560 --> 30:38.727
- Blood for blood. 
- [Ahmos] Don't be foolish.

30:38.729 --> 30:41.062
What can a few women
and children do against them?

30:41.064 --> 30:44.299
Do you know what terrifies the
Caliphate more than anything?

30:44.301 --> 30:46.301
A girl with a gun.

30:46.303 --> 30:48.303
Women are such
lowly beings to them,

30:48.305 --> 30:50.639
they think if they're killed by
one, they won't get to paradise.

30:50.641 --> 30:53.074
You think that will
make you invincible?

30:53.076 --> 30:56.244
Some may run from you, while
others aim to cut you down.

30:56.246 --> 30:58.246
There's too many of them.

30:58.248 --> 31:00.482
Then we cut them
 down first.

31:00.482 --> 31:03.480
[hatch creaks]

31:07.925 --> 31:09.257
We'll use the catacombs
 to find

31:09.259 --> 31:11.259
where they're housing
their soldiers.

31:11.261 --> 31:13.094
[sighs] We can
pick off survivors

31:13.096 --> 31:15.497
or a few drawn by the
explosions before we fall back.

31:15.499 --> 31:16.932
I think you're making 
a mistake.

31:16.934 --> 31:18.834
This doesn't concern you.

31:18.836 --> 31:20.836
It concerns everyone.

31:20.838 --> 31:23.605
Don't assume what you've
lost here gives you

31:23.607 --> 31:25.040
a monopoly on suffering.

31:27.344 --> 31:32.180
These hit-and-hide tactics,
I've seen them used before.

31:32.182 --> 31:35.283
By Ihab Rashid
before he joined the Caliphate.

31:35.285 --> 31:38.687
They didn't work for him,
and they won't work for you.

31:38.689 --> 31:41.690
You just suffer
even worse retribution.

31:41.692 --> 31:43.491
What, are you saying
we do nothing?

31:43.493 --> 31:44.960
[sighs]

31:44.962 --> 31:46.962
If we're gonna beat them,

31:46.964 --> 31:50.799
then we have to be able to
attack them on multiple fronts,

31:50.801 --> 31:52.467
keep them off balance,

31:52.469 --> 31:54.469
shake up their morale,
put them on the defensive.

31:54.471 --> 31:56.805
Khalil,
 look around you.

31:56.807 --> 31:59.641
We will need far more
many fighters to do

31:59.643 --> 32:00.976
what you're suggesting.

32:00.978 --> 32:02.477
You mentioned
 the catacombs.

32:02.479 --> 32:04.713
We've been using them
to attack the Caliphate.

32:04.715 --> 32:07.382
Well, now we're gonna use
them to get more soldiers.

32:08.450 --> 32:11.219
I need you to get
a message to Munir.

32:13.490 --> 32:15.557
[cars honking]

32:15.557 --> 32:17.550
[man shouting]

32:17.550 --> 32:19.550
[honking continues]

32:19.550 --> 32:23.550
[indistinct chat coming from the street]

32:23.550 --> 32:25.550
[utensils clinking]

32:30.007 --> 32:32.774
[Jane] You must be
 famished.

33:02.239 --> 33:04.306
Take off your clothes.

33:06.500 --> 33:09.000
[curtains roll]

33:27.464 --> 33:29.531
I've waited
a long time for this.

33:38.030 --> 33:40.530
[Daliyah shivering]

33:50.087 --> 33:53.421
[gasping]

33:53.423 --> 33:55.983
I expected more fight
 from you.

33:57.090 --> 33:59.090
[gasping]

33:59.090 --> 34:01.598
[smooches]
[Abu Omar moans]

34:01.598 --> 34:03.665
I wouldn't give you
the satisfaction.

34:24.321 --> 34:26.388
You're perfect.

34:29.380 --> 34:34.380
[smooching and moaning resume]

34:39.636 --> 34:40.835
[whimpers]

34:40.837 --> 34:43.138
[explosion]

34:43.139 --> 34:45.306
What the hell?

34:45.308 --> 34:48.176
[men shouting]

34:48.178 --> 34:51.478
[Daliyah sobbing]

34:51.481 --> 34:53.915
[gasping]

34:53.915 --> 34:58.910
[shouting continues]

35:02.325 --> 35:03.525
[phone ringing]

35:03.527 --> 35:05.827
[Munir] I hit the
 weapons depot.

35:05.829 --> 35:07.562
Send the
 Caliphate my way.

35:11.868 --> 35:15.236
[gunfire]

35:17.230 --> 35:19.230
[men scream]

35:19.230 --> 35:21.230
[bullets bouncing]

35:24.830 --> 35:27.150
[bullets clanging]

35:28.051 --> 35:29.350
It's the weapons depot.

35:29.352 --> 35:31.019
Our brothers
 are under attack.

35:31.021 --> 35:33.388
Orders are for reinforcements.
They need them now.

35:33.390 --> 35:35.256
Go. All of you.

35:35.258 --> 35:37.826
I'll get the guards
from the inside to cover?

35:42.365 --> 35:45.266
[shouting in Arabic]

35:45.266 --> 35:48.260
[engines roaring]
[tires screeching]

35:52.370 --> 35:54.377
[people speak all at once]

35:54.377 --> 35:56.544
Uthal needs reinforcements
at the gate.

35:56.546 --> 35:59.106
I'll cover your posts.

35:59.610 --> 36:02.617
[murmuring, shouting]

36:02.617 --> 36:05.610
[metallic fence clanging]

36:11.610 --> 36:14.610
[murmuring and shouting continue]

36:18.068 --> 36:19.467
Follow me.

36:23.273 --> 36:25.673
[Ahmos clamoring] Siddiq.

36:25.673 --> 36:27.310
[prisoners shouting]

36:27.310 --> 36:29.244
Everyone, 
we must be quiet.

36:29.246 --> 36:30.645
Go.

36:31.915 --> 36:33.181
[speaking Arabic]

36:41.992 --> 36:45.426
Abu Omar, we counted
only one sniper,

36:45.428 --> 36:46.895
but he's gone.

36:49.332 --> 36:50.665
The prison.

36:52.802 --> 36:54.102
Uthal. Uthal!

36:54.104 --> 36:55.937
[speaks Arabic]

36:55.939 --> 36:57.772
[Abu Omar] The weapons
 depot

36:57.774 --> 36:59.774
was a distraction.
Lock down the prison.

36:59.776 --> 37:00.808
[Halima] Please!

37:00.810 --> 37:02.443
Please, 
don't leave us here.

37:02.445 --> 37:04.445
Please! Please!

37:04.447 --> 37:06.681
Please
 don't leave us here.

37:08.680 --> 37:12.480
[Bassam gasps]
[fence clangs]

37:12.489 --> 37:13.855
Go, go, go, go!

37:17.790 --> 37:19.796
[speaks indistinctly]

37:19.796 --> 37:21.196

[bullets cut through air]

37:29.190 --> 37:32.190
[women speak indistinctly]

37:32.676 --> 37:34.042
Munir.

37:35.512 --> 37:36.978
You have to stay.

37:36.980 --> 37:39.647
You're more use to us
working on the inside.

37:39.649 --> 37:42.217
No, he's my father.
You can't ask that of me.

37:42.219 --> 37:44.219
Listen to him, Munir.

37:44.221 --> 37:45.486
He's right.

37:45.488 --> 37:46.788
They need you.

37:46.788 --> 37:48.690
[Ahmos breaths shakily]

37:48.690 --> 37:49.924
Please, 
do as he tells you.

37:51.161 --> 37:53.461
For me. [gasping]

37:53.461 --> 37:56.030
[footsteps tapping and departing]

37:56.032 --> 37:57.765
Get him out of here.

37:57.760 --> 38:02.403
[men shouting]

38:07.043 --> 38:08.676
There he is!
 The tunnels,

38:08.678 --> 38:11.238
the tunnels, the
tunnels, there he is!

38:12.515 --> 38:14.082

[explosions]

38:27.931 --> 38:30.865

38:30.867 --> 38:33.427
General's uniform suits you.

38:33.427 --> 38:36.420
[camera shutter clicks]

38:36.420 --> 38:38.208
[murmuring continues]

38:38.208 --> 38:40.675
This palace is
 your home now.

38:41.945 --> 38:43.378
Never forget that.

38:43.380 --> 38:48.916
[clears throat] Rami...
my wife Nusrat.

38:48.918 --> 38:51.319
Very nice to meet you.

39:00.800 --> 39:03.800
[camera shutter clicks]

39:03.800 --> 39:05.233
[clears throat]

39:05.235 --> 39:06.634
Thank you.

39:09.606 --> 39:12.740
People of our great nation,

39:12.742 --> 39:16.077
we stand at a crossroad.

39:16.079 --> 39:18.246
I speak of the suffering

39:18.248 --> 39:21.449
now prevailing
 over our land,

39:21.451 --> 39:24.252
brought by the brutality
of foreign invaders

39:24.254 --> 39:28.456
declaring themselves
the true Caliphate.

39:28.458 --> 39:31.759
Many of you have fallen
into the trap

39:31.761 --> 39:34.629
of what has been cast
as a conflict

39:34.631 --> 39:38.132
between this government
and an opposition.

39:38.134 --> 39:40.601
Make no mistake,

39:40.603 --> 39:44.939
this is a conflict between
the homeland and its enemies.

39:44.941 --> 39:48.776
<i>[Jamal] These radicals
have killed the innocent</i>

39:48.778 --> 39:51.679
<i>in order to extinguish
light and brightness</i>

39:51.681 --> 39:54.816
<i>in our country.</i>

39:54.818 --> 39:56.851
<i>But they are wrong.</i>

39:58.021 --> 40:01.189
[Abu Omar] This man,
 Khalil,

40:01.191 --> 40:03.257
he's here in Ma'an.

40:06.963 --> 40:08.629
The bullet's
 still inside you.

40:08.631 --> 40:11.032
I'm gonna see if I can find
some instruments

40:11.034 --> 40:13.701
- or something like that.
- It's all right.

40:13.703 --> 40:16.404
I don't feel the pain anymore.

40:18.141 --> 40:21.142
Ghani needs Daliyah.

40:21.144 --> 40:22.777
Find her.

40:25.014 --> 40:27.815
Promise me.

40:27.817 --> 40:29.951
Find her.

40:36.659 --> 40:39.394
I'll find her.

40:53.390 --> 40:56.390
[Bassam exhales deeply]

41:06.390 --> 41:08.390
[sighs]

41:08.390 --> 41:12.390
[wind gusting]

41:12.390 --> 41:14.690
[people murmuring]

41:14.697 --> 41:18.566
Come nightfall, we need to find
a way out of the city.

41:18.568 --> 41:20.034
There are Banu Zahra

41:20.036 --> 41:21.869
in the western provinces.

41:21.871 --> 41:23.771
We'll head there.

41:23.773 --> 41:25.573
You want to run?

41:25.575 --> 41:27.875
This is our home. We need
to stay and fight for it.

41:27.877 --> 41:30.044
Too many of us
have died defending it.

41:30.046 --> 41:32.380
I have to protect
what people we have left.

41:32.382 --> 41:34.062
- Siddiq...
- Ru'a.

41:35.385 --> 41:37.251
You have to respect 
my decision.

41:37.253 --> 41:39.387
We're leaving.

41:39.389 --> 41:41.889
[Barry] Then every one

41:41.891 --> 41:43.558
of your family
 who has died,

41:43.560 --> 41:50.398
including this man,
will have died in vain.

41:50.400 --> 41:53.468
Who the hell are you?

41:53.470 --> 41:56.204
[Ru'a] His name's Khalil.

41:57.607 --> 42:00.167
Breaking you all
out was his idea.

42:07.417 --> 42:10.585
Look, I have to do
what I think is best.

42:10.587 --> 42:12.620
I understand.

42:12.622 --> 42:15.323
But right now,
 word is spreading

42:15.325 --> 42:16.824
about your escape.

42:16.826 --> 42:20.761
People are hearing
that the Banu Zahra

42:20.763 --> 42:22.163
got the better
 of the Caliphate.

42:22.163 --> 42:24.760
[people murmuring]

42:24.767 --> 42:25.833
They'll be inspired

42:25.835 --> 42:27.134
to fight back
 themselves.

42:27.136 --> 42:29.470
They will be cut down,
as we were.

42:29.472 --> 42:31.506
Not if you join
 with them.

42:33.109 --> 42:34.442
Think of it.

42:34.444 --> 42:36.344
The Banu Zahra

42:36.346 --> 42:38.446
and every other tribe
in this city,

42:38.448 --> 42:40.848
united against
 a common enemy.

42:42.519 --> 42:44.685
Our ancestors
 drove the Romans

42:44.687 --> 42:47.655
from this land.

42:47.657 --> 42:51.859
Cast down the
Sassanians in battle.

42:51.861 --> 42:54.295
They refused to bow down

42:54.297 --> 42:57.331
to a foreign invader that
came here to steal our homes

42:57.333 --> 43:00.268
and steal our women.

43:03.806 --> 43:06.207
And now it's our turn.

43:07.840 --> 43:11.145
[Jamal] <i>Nowhere is our national
character more defined</i>

43:11.147 --> 43:14.482
<i>than in the city of Ma'an.</i>

43:14.484 --> 43:17.385
So many brave
and valiant soldiers

43:17.387 --> 43:20.154
lost their life during
these violent few days

43:20.156 --> 43:22.990
when Ma'an fell.

43:22.992 --> 43:25.026
Not least of all.

43:25.028 --> 43:28.563
General Tariq Al Fayeed.

43:31.167 --> 43:34.735
He loyally 
served this nation

43:34.737 --> 43:36.170
for many years.

43:36.172 --> 43:39.674
In his stead,
 I have appointed

43:39.676 --> 43:42.243
a new commander
of our armed forces.

43:42.245 --> 43:44.078
I present to you.

43:44.080 --> 43:46.881
General Rami Said,
a son of Ma'an.

43:46.883 --> 43:50.184
He has been entrusted
 to deliver

43:50.186 --> 43:53.254
that city from the grip
of these terrorists.

43:53.256 --> 43:56.023
General Said 
has already been

43:56.025 --> 43:57.858
<i>building our arsenal</i>

43:57.860 --> 44:00.561
<i>and readying
for our counteroffensive</i>

44:00.563 --> 44:03.030
<i>against the invaders.</i>

44:03.032 --> 44:07.268
<i>Hand in hand,
despite all our wounds,</i>

44:07.270 --> 44:09.904
we will rescue Ma'an,

44:09.906 --> 44:12.373
retake our oil fields,

44:12.375 --> 44:15.710
and we will see,
once and for all,

44:15.712 --> 44:21.382
which of ours
is truly God's army.

44:34.230 --> 44:38.132
Bassam Al Fayeed...

44:41.804 --> 44:43.471
Before he died,
 he inspired me

44:43.473 --> 44:45.806
to think that
things could change here.

44:49.245 --> 44:51.612
That it was 
important to rise up

44:51.614 --> 44:54.749
and speak out
against the regime.

44:54.751 --> 44:56.150
To fight against anything

44:56.152 --> 44:58.686
or anyone that robs us
of our freedoms.

45:02.659 --> 45:06.861
I guess I just wanted to thank
you for making me believe again.
