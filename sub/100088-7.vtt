Can you believe
they still want us to use

22:00.188 --> 22:01.755
"what appears to be"
in these logs?

22:01.798 --> 22:04.584
Everyone's got to
cover their ass.

22:04.627 --> 22:07.369
I'm fine with it up until they
want us to do the covering.

22:07.413 --> 22:08.849
I'd say half of what we do

22:08.892 --> 22:11.242
is fixing politicians'
overseas messes.

22:11.286 --> 22:13.680
Yeah, that's what made
Ambassador Marsden different.

22:13.723 --> 22:15.290

man, she...

22:15.334 --> 22:17.597
She did what she thought
was right.

22:17.640 --> 22:18.946
Frickin' baller.

22:18.989 --> 22:20.295
Yeah, just remember

22:20.339 --> 22:22.253
that she was the exception
and not the rule.

22:22.297 --> 22:25.866
Wrong people die, a lot.

22:25.909 --> 22:26.867
Oh, wait. Here we go.

22:26.910 --> 22:30.087

what appears

22:30.131 --> 22:31.872

22:31.915 --> 22:33.874

appears to be

22:33.917 --> 22:35.528
their morning coffee.Mm-hmm.

22:35.571 --> 22:37.921
Right on schedule.

22:37.965 --> 22:40.097
Grandma's a Bohemian,
by the way.

22:40.881 --> 22:43.013

22:43.057 --> 22:44.580
Right.

22:44.624 --> 22:48.454
John Lennon was
strictly American.

22:51.413 --> 22:55.374
Bald dude's been sitting at his
desk for the last three hours.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.376
Maybe he's working on a novel.

22:57.419 --> 22:58.464
No way that guy's a writer.

22:58.507 --> 23:00.030
He's got an Oasis poster
over his desk.

23:00.074 --> 23:02.859
That the kind of thing
I'd learn in sniper school?

23:02.903 --> 23:04.687
Since I haven't been,
maybe you two should, uh,

23:04.731 --> 23:06.036
give me the CliffsNotes.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.082
There aren't any
CliffsNotes on this one.

23:08.125 --> 23:10.258
Only way to learn
precision rifle

23:10.301 --> 23:12.826
is to do it and
to keep doing it.

23:12.869 --> 23:16.090
I went through the
schoolhouse 18 years ago,

23:16.133 --> 23:18.919
been working as a
lead sniper for 12.

23:18.962 --> 23:20.529
And I'm still learning.

23:20.573 --> 23:22.139
That's a lot of time.

23:22.183 --> 23:23.576
Time's the best teacher.

23:23.619 --> 23:26.100
All right, new guy.
How about some OJT?

23:26.143 --> 23:27.710
Do you know what
a cold bore shot is?

23:27.754 --> 23:30.713
First shot out the rifle,
before the bore heats up.

23:30.757 --> 23:32.933
What other factors do we have
to take into account?

23:32.976 --> 23:35.544
Wind, temperature,

23:35.588 --> 23:37.241
dew point,

23:37.285 --> 23:39.418
Coriolis?

23:39.461 --> 23:41.158
Coriolis effect doesn't
factor in at this distance,

23:41.202 --> 23:42.551
but you're missing a big one.

23:42.595 --> 23:44.379
What?

23:45.424 --> 23:47.338
Gravity.

23:47.382 --> 23:49.166
Gravity impacts
the bullet the most.

23:49.210 --> 23:51.299
Number one rule
in a firefight is?

23:51.342 --> 23:53.519
To prioritize and execute.That's right.

23:53.562 --> 23:54.737
Precision rifle

23:54.781 --> 23:56.347
is no different.

23:56.391 --> 23:58.480
You determine the factors
affecting the shot,

23:58.524 --> 24:00.569
and you
prioritize them.

24:00.613 --> 24:02.615
Gravity and wind, always first.

24:02.658 --> 24:04.138
RAY:
Then you add in all
the other factors,

24:04.181 --> 24:05.531
crunch the numbers,

24:05.574 --> 24:08.534
then you can get your
firing solution and execute.

24:08.577 --> 24:10.057
Lot of math.

24:10.100 --> 24:12.276
Why do you think Sonny
carries a machine gun?

24:12.320 --> 24:13.843

gonna find any here.

B.O. and cheese.

24:38.955 --> 24:42.481

Well, old happy guy here

24:42.524 --> 24:46.006

Not so fast.

24:47.529 --> 24:48.791

24:48.835 --> 24:50.140

24:50.184 --> 24:51.446

24:51.490 --> 24:53.448

Well, I'll put

24:53.492 --> 24:55.145

comes home tonight.

24:55.189 --> 24:57.278

on the line,

24:57.321 --> 24:59.323
she is gonna pull that rip cord.

24:59.367 --> 25:02.326
A big breakup feels like
the end of the world, Sonny,

25:02.370 --> 25:04.154
but eventually, you just,
you don't feel it anymore.

25:04.198 --> 25:06.940
Tell you what, man, I ain't ever
gonna fall in that trap again.

25:06.983 --> 25:08.985
All right, so what's
your big plan?

25:09.029 --> 25:10.204
You just never gonna date
anybody again? Is that it?

25:10.247 --> 25:11.510
I'm gonna

25:11.553 --> 25:14.338
