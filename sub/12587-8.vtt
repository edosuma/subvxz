<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:34.993 --> 00:36.245
Thank you for helping us

00:36.453 --> 00:38.956
register for our baby
shower, Aunt Peggy.

00:38.956 --> 00:42.130
Well, when I heard you planned
to get all your baby supplies

00:42.125 --> 00:45.299
at 7-Eleven, I decided
it was time to step in.

00:45.295 --> 00:48.549
There are plenty of times
that I wish <i>I</i> had a device

00:48.549 --> 00:50.722
to hold me upright
in the bathtub.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.139
Got it.

00:52.135 --> 00:54.763
I can't believe that
in less than two weeks

00:54.763 --> 00:57.733
I will have a
teeny-tiny little baby!

00:57.724 --> 00:59.567
There's still
so much I don't know.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.528
Well, you don't have
to know anything...

01:01.520 --> 01:03.522
Because I will be
giving you and Lucky

01:03.522 --> 01:05.319
the greatest gift of all:

01:05.315 --> 01:08.319
my 13 years of experience
as a mother!

01:08.318 --> 01:10.286
And a real gift, too, right?

01:10.279 --> 01:12.247
Of course.
Thank you, Aunt Peggy!

01:12.406 --> 01:15.205
I guess all I have to worry
about is giving birth,

01:15.200 --> 01:17.294
and you'll teach me
how to do everything else.

01:17.286 --> 01:18.287
That is right.

01:18.287 --> 01:20.881
And take it from me,
giving birth, Luanne,

01:20.872 --> 01:25.252
will be one of
the best days of your life.

01:25.252 --> 01:28.802
<i>It was for me,
thanks to modern medicine.</i>

01:28.797 --> 01:31.801
Okay, honey, I'm gonna give you
a little something for the pain.

01:31.800 --> 01:32.926
Don't worry, Peggy,

01:32.926 --> 01:34.894
I'm here for you.

01:50.319 --> 01:51.787
I did not fully wake up

01:51.778 --> 01:53.655
until the ride home
from the hospital.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.202
That's what <i>I</i> want,
Aunt Peggy...

01:55.365 --> 01:59.666
A foggy memory I can
treasure for a lifetime.

01:59.661 --> 02:02.130
Welcome to Want-A Burger.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.965
I'm Jane. May I take your order?

02:03.957 --> 02:06.255
You may. I'd like a triple-meat,
triple-cheese meal

02:06.418 --> 02:09.297
with hot lemon pie
and a large soda. That's...

02:09.295 --> 02:10.513
That's all the sodas

02:10.505 --> 02:11.882
mixed together?

02:11.882 --> 02:13.475
You... know what I want?

02:13.467 --> 02:15.720
Of course I do...
You're a regular, honey.

02:15.719 --> 02:18.097
"Honey"?

02:18.096 --> 02:20.019
You're not Jane!

02:20.015 --> 02:21.062
Who's Jane?

02:21.058 --> 02:22.310
The drive-thru lady.

02:22.309 --> 02:24.311
We sort of have a thing.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.609
Ah. Well, I'm not supposed
to say anything,

02:26.605 --> 02:29.324
but the drive-thru people
don't actually work here.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.318
But I talk to her every night.

02:31.318 --> 02:34.288
Well, they work out of a call
center in Buckeye, Arizona.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.747
It's cheaper that way.

02:35.739 --> 02:36.991
Arizona?

02:36.990 --> 02:39.038
Well, then...
that's where I'll go.

02:39.034 --> 02:42.288
I'll go to Arizona and find her
and tell her how I feel.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.540
Okay. I'm
really gonna do it!

02:44.539 --> 02:47.258
Knock yourself out, sir.

02:50.295 --> 02:51.296
Isn't that sweet?

02:51.296 --> 02:52.843
All right,

02:52.839 --> 02:55.137
time for another game...
Give the paper a tug.

02:55.133 --> 02:58.262
I don't know what this game is,
but I bet I win.

02:58.428 --> 02:59.645
Watch this!

03:02.808 --> 03:06.153
For every one of them squares,
you owe that baby ten bucks!

03:06.144 --> 03:07.487
But...

03:07.479 --> 03:09.072
I'm just a kid.

03:09.064 --> 03:10.816
You best pay up, son.

03:10.816 --> 03:12.318
This is a rough-looking crowd.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.319
Yeah. Maybe they'd
all feel more at home

03:14.319 --> 03:16.617
if I served the cake
up on cinder blocks.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.252
That must be my baby sister.

03:22.244 --> 03:24.997
Notice how I waited
to get drunk?

03:24.996 --> 03:26.998
No wonder
she's the last one here.

03:26.998 --> 03:30.298
Most tractors won't go
over ten miles an hour.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.842
Hey, baby sis!

03:34.089 --> 03:35.511
Luanne,

03:35.507 --> 03:36.975
this is Myrna.

03:36.967 --> 03:40.221
Myrna, this is
my beautiful wife Luanne.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.564
And this is our beautiful baby.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.558
Well, I hope.

03:44.558 --> 03:48.153
Well, it's great to finally
meet the both of you.

03:48.145 --> 03:50.147
And you must be Peggy.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.491
Thank you for inviting me
into your lovely home.

03:52.482 --> 03:53.404
You're welcome.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.243
And I bet these little ones

03:55.235 --> 03:56.361
would like some juice.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.284
They aren't allowed
to drink juice.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.658
They'll have water
and read a book.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.496
Those kids ain't right.

04:05.495 --> 04:08.169
I must admit,
you're not what I expected.

04:08.165 --> 04:10.213
I thought you'd be a lot more...

04:10.375 --> 04:11.467
Rustic?

04:11.460 --> 04:14.179
What a polite way to say
what I was thinking.

04:14.171 --> 04:17.300
I wasn't happy with the environment
in which Lucky and I were raised.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.802
All our family dinners were
preceded by my father saying,

04:19.801 --> 04:21.519
"Hey, look what I found!"

04:21.511 --> 04:23.684
Well, score one for nurture.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.103
Oh, and you don't have
to worry about these two.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.067
I live right across the street,

04:28.059 --> 04:32.109
and I am teaching them everything
I know about raising a child.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.107
Between you and me,

04:34.107 --> 04:36.951
when Lucky called and said
he was going to be a father,

04:36.943 --> 04:39.787
I-I cried, right there
in yoga class.

04:39.780 --> 04:40.952
See this scar?

04:40.947 --> 04:43.200
It's where my head
hit the coffee table

04:43.200 --> 04:44.201
when Luanne told me.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.290
Did you know Lucky
once served me

04:46.286 --> 04:48.584
something he called
"fancy squirrel"?

04:48.580 --> 04:49.706
That is nothing.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.300
Luanne once got stuck
on an escalator.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.294
Well, thank
God they have us.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.548
I hear that.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.305
Bill, I know
you're pretty fired up

05:05.305 --> 05:08.229
about driving to Arizona
for love and whatnot,

05:08.225 --> 05:10.819
but you ought to consider
your other option:

05:10.811 --> 05:12.859
not driving to Arizona.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.198
What Jane and I have
is special, Hank.

05:15.190 --> 05:18.160
Too special to let New Mexico
keep us apart.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.528
So long, fellas!

05:19.528 --> 05:24.159
So, Bill's taking a solo
road trip through the desert.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.750
How much of Bill's body

05:25.742 --> 05:29.372
do you think vultures
will refuse to eat?

05:30.455 --> 05:32.378
Ah...

05:33.875 --> 05:36.003
And this one is from me.

05:37.295 --> 05:38.888
Trust me,

05:38.880 --> 05:41.508
it will be your "breast" friend.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.303
I... don't get it.

05:45.303 --> 05:48.523
But thank you for
the horseshoe-shaped pillow.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.109
It will bring
the baby good luck.

05:51.101 --> 05:53.103
I-It's for feeding the baby.

05:53.103 --> 05:57.153
You do realize that you're going
to have to feed the baby, right?

05:57.148 --> 06:00.152
With all due respect,
Luanne and I don't need

06:00.151 --> 06:02.870
some fancy pillow
to feed our baby.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.662
Monkeys don't need pillows
to feed their young.

06:07.284 --> 06:08.786
I'm not following you.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.004
I've watched
a lot of nature programs,

06:10.996 --> 06:13.795
and it seems to me
most of life's questions

06:13.790 --> 06:16.293
can be answered
with another question:

06:16.293 --> 06:18.591
What would a monkey do?

06:18.587 --> 06:21.215
And here's something
else for you two.

06:21.381 --> 06:24.555
I saved every single thing
that Bobby ever wore,

06:24.551 --> 06:26.770
sat in or spit up on.

06:26.761 --> 06:30.311
I only hope they bring you
as much joy as they brought me.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.560
Oh, my gosh!

06:32.559 --> 06:34.732
Thank you, Aunt Peggy!

06:37.689 --> 06:42.160
We meet again, Mr. Giggles.

06:45.614 --> 06:46.706
You're not actually going

06:46.698 --> 06:48.416
to give this stuff
to Luanne, are you?

06:48.408 --> 06:50.581
Oh, no. I'm just
gonna let her borrow it

06:50.577 --> 06:51.669
till Bobby has a child.

06:53.121 --> 06:55.544
We've learned so much
about parenting

06:55.540 --> 06:57.508
since this mobile was made.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.344
It wasn't designed to
stimulate baby brain growth.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.714
Oh, you modern mothers!

07:01.713 --> 07:03.932
You need all those
gadgets and gizmos.

07:03.924 --> 07:07.394
Back in my day,
we had to get by on gumption.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.513
And Bobby turned out just fine.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.982
Yes. And if Bobby is the kind
of child Luanne wants to raise,

07:15.977 --> 07:17.854
she should certainly
follow your advice.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.697
This is gonna get good.

07:19.689 --> 07:22.067
Now, hold on,
there is nothing wrong

07:22.067 --> 07:24.069
with how I raised my child.

07:24.069 --> 07:27.073
I'm just saying it might be
a good idea for Lucky and Luanne

07:27.072 --> 07:29.166
to take a childcare class,
so they can learn,

07:29.157 --> 07:32.001
or unlearn, whatever they need.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.666
Fine.

07:34.663 --> 07:36.711
Why don't we all go...
Perhaps we'll all get

07:36.706 --> 07:38.674
a refresher on what's
important to a child,

07:38.667 --> 07:39.919
and what's just
a desperate attempt

07:39.918 --> 07:42.171
to prove to the world
that you're a good mother.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.183
Fun!

07:49.719 --> 07:51.892
Welcome to Baby Care Basics.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.686
I'm Gloria, your instructor.

07:53.682 --> 07:55.650
We will cover many
topics in our course,

07:55.809 --> 07:58.688
including how to soothe
a teething baby. Oh!

07:58.687 --> 07:59.609
I know this one.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.318
My Aunt Peggy told me.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.861
Scotch on the gums.

08:05.402 --> 08:06.699
No. Giving
a child alcohol

08:06.695 --> 08:08.413
is never advised.

08:08.405 --> 08:09.702
Well... not a lot.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.700
Just enough
to take the edge off.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.668
I find if I freeze a peach slice

08:13.827 --> 08:15.704
and wrap it in a washcloth,

08:15.704 --> 08:17.547
the baby gets
soothing pain relief

08:17.539 --> 08:19.291
and a serving of fruit.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.382
Mmm.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.672
We will also discuss

08:21.668 --> 08:24.717
how to help a baby
sleep through the night.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.090
Maybe let someone else answer.

08:26.089 --> 08:28.717
Oh-oh! Aunt Peggy
told me that one, too.

08:28.717 --> 08:30.640
Put it on its stomach

08:30.635 --> 08:33.229
and surround it with lots
of pillows and blankets,

08:33.221 --> 08:34.643
so it feels secure.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.683
Oh, my, that-that's
outdated information.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.027
We now know
that's quite dangerous.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.645
No one should listen
to this woman.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.529
In fact, I'm going to take
this doll away from you.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.448
I'm not sure I'm comfortable
with you practicing on it.

08:58.538 --> 09:02.088
I can't believe...
that I got kicked out of...

09:02.083 --> 09:03.710
our baby class.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.883
My baby's gonna be
here in two weeks!

09:05.879 --> 09:09.053
I don't have time to learn
what I need to learn!

09:09.049 --> 09:11.177
We're gonna fix this, baby doll.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.554
I will go to the video store

09:13.553 --> 09:16.682
and rent every monkey
movie ever made.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.683
No, <i>I</i> will fix this.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.481
I'll have Jason
pick up the kids today.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.229
I'll stay here
until the baby is born

09:22.228 --> 09:24.697
and teach you everything I know,
which is a lot.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.407
You do not have to do that.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.322
Yes, things have changed
since I had Bobby,

09:28.318 --> 09:30.446
but I still know
how to raise a child.

09:30.445 --> 09:33.198
And there is nothing wrong
with any of this stuff.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.287
Um, I think we're gonna
start listening

09:38.286 --> 09:40.288
to Myrna now, Aunt Peggy.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.666
It's not that we don't love you,

09:42.832 --> 09:46.211
it's just that, well,
we want our baby to live.

09:46.211 --> 09:49.306
I have read every book,
magazine and blog

09:49.297 --> 09:50.719
dedicated to childcare.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.717
Lucky, you will need
to baby-proof this house.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.060
Can do.

09:54.052 --> 09:56.680
When I'm done, not even
the wiliest of babies

09:56.679 --> 09:58.647
will be able to get in here.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.189
And, Luanne, I will make sure
you have a drug-free,

10:01.184 --> 10:02.982
stress-free hypno-birth.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.900
No, no, no...
Trust me,

10:04.896 --> 10:07.695
you need hard,
class-three narcotics.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.692
Drugs are for
sick people, Peggy.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.286
Luanne isn't going to treat
her baby like a disease.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.372
Like you did with <i>your</i> son.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.998
It must be cold out
there in the desert tonight.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.713
I have my love to keep me warm.

10:22.705 --> 10:25.959
I'll talk to you when I get
to Truth or Consequences.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.178
I'll have a salad

10:28.169 --> 10:29.341
and a diet soda.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.634
Staying in shape, huh, honey?

10:30.797 --> 10:33.095
"Honey"?

10:34.259 --> 10:36.261
I thought I was "honey"!

10:36.261 --> 10:37.683
Is that you, Bill?

10:37.679 --> 10:39.477
How many other honeys
do you have?

10:39.472 --> 10:41.691
Is it just him, or do you say it

10:41.683 --> 10:43.685
to every salad-eating
playboy in a Taurus?

10:43.685 --> 10:45.312
What? Good-bye, Jane!

10:45.311 --> 10:46.437
Forever!

10:46.437 --> 10:48.610
Wait, no! Bill, come back!

10:48.606 --> 10:51.860
You know what?
A lemon pie sounds pretty good.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.158
And this Myrna is
filling Luanne's head

10:54.154 --> 10:56.202
with all sorts of crazy ideas.

10:56.197 --> 10:59.622
And Luanne is soaking them up
like a simple, obedient sponge.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.627
Well, Myrna was right about

11:01.619 --> 11:03.713
some of these hand-me-downs
being dangerous.

11:03.705 --> 11:07.084
I'm not sure pacifiers
come painted anymore.

11:07.083 --> 11:10.428
I still have plenty to teach
Luanne about being a good mom.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.718
She just won't listen to me.

11:12.714 --> 11:14.842
Luanne needs to learn
this stuff on her own.

11:14.841 --> 11:17.435
It might be time to push
her out of the nest

11:17.427 --> 11:18.849
and get our freedom back.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.682
Come on, Peggy, push with me.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.185
Maybe you're right.

11:25.185 --> 11:28.689
Besides, if I fight,
I'm gonna lose her.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.191
I will have to bend.

11:32.942 --> 11:35.661
Thanks for helping me
baby-proof, gentlemen.

11:35.653 --> 11:36.700
No problem.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.324
One of the many joys
of being a parent

11:39.324 --> 11:41.292
is all the stuff
you get to assemble

11:41.284 --> 11:42.627
and then, later, disassemble.

11:42.785 --> 11:45.208
Myrna says we're supposed
to crawl around

11:45.205 --> 11:46.832
to find out what's dangerous.

11:50.293 --> 11:51.715
It's amazing.

11:51.711 --> 11:55.432
To an unsuspecting baby, almost
anything can become a weapon.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.676
For example, this weapon.

11:59.427 --> 12:02.681
Lucky, I know you care a lot
about what your sister says,

12:02.680 --> 12:04.557
but maybe it's time
you and Luanne

12:04.557 --> 12:06.150
started thinking for yourselves.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.689
No can do, Uncle Hank.

12:13.691 --> 12:16.410
Choking hazard identified.

12:20.615 --> 12:23.664
I can't wait to show you
the new nursery, Aunt Peggy.

12:23.826 --> 12:26.670
And I cannot wait to see it.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.542
Myrna.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.131
Ta-da!

12:37.340 --> 12:38.637
Oh, my!

12:38.633 --> 12:40.727
Myrna says everything is
black and white and red

12:40.718 --> 12:42.686
to help the baby see and think.

12:42.679 --> 12:43.680
Really?

12:43.680 --> 12:45.307
Hmm.

12:45.306 --> 12:48.025
I wonder if that's why
the Nazis chose those colors.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.394
Over here is the
tummy-time station

12:49.394 --> 12:51.943
where Luanne will give her
baby three ten-minute

12:51.938 --> 12:53.986
strength-building
sessions per day.

12:53.982 --> 12:56.861
And these DVDs are gonna
help my baby's brain.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.203
This worm has so much wisdom.

13:01.990 --> 13:04.288
Oh, for God's sake.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.083
That's what it sounds
like inside my womb.

13:07.078 --> 13:09.547
It's what you would hear
if I swallowed your ear.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.507
Isn't this room wonderful?

13:11.499 --> 13:13.342
Well, I think
you captured the...

13:13.334 --> 13:15.632
I mean, I think it's...

13:17.088 --> 13:18.510
I think it's awful.

13:18.506 --> 13:21.305
Luanne, it's joyless.
It's creepy.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.646
Peggy, this is awkward enough
without you critiquing our nursery.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.435
This is Luanne's nursery.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.399
And if she keeps
listening to you,

13:28.391 --> 13:30.234
her kid is gonna
end up like yours,

13:30.226 --> 13:33.230
a book-reading,
water-drinking robot!

13:34.605 --> 13:36.073
Um! guys...

13:36.065 --> 13:37.692
Not now, Luanne!
Not now, Luanne!

13:37.692 --> 13:40.036
I think the baby's coming.

13:41.112 --> 13:42.489
Ow!

13:45.616 --> 13:47.710
Why can't Luanne just give birth

13:47.702 --> 13:50.205
in a gotdang hospital,
like everyone else?

13:50.204 --> 13:52.252
You are preaching
to the choir, Hank,

13:52.248 --> 13:54.421
but no one is asking me anymore.

13:54.417 --> 13:57.011
Well, I guess a waiting room
is a waiting room.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.676
Luanne, or should I say Myrna,

13:58.838 --> 14:00.966
doesn't want us
in a waiting room. Uh-uh.

14:00.965 --> 14:03.718
She wants everyone with her
as she gives birth...

14:03.718 --> 14:05.095
In that tub.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.564
Bah!

14:08.556 --> 14:10.604
What doctor agreed to this?

14:10.600 --> 14:11.897
There is no doctor.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.941
The baby will be delivered
by a facilitator.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.188
That man

14:15.188 --> 14:17.282
in the open robe and Speedo.

14:19.317 --> 14:20.569
Ugh.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.662
This is gonna ruin
baths for me forever.

14:28.284 --> 14:31.163
Do all these people
really have to be here?

14:31.162 --> 14:33.585
Trust me, this is
the best way for your baby

14:33.581 --> 14:36.175
to enter the world... surrounded
by a support network.

14:36.167 --> 14:39.717
If we open up all the windows,
can I light a hibachi?

14:39.712 --> 14:41.510
Here comes another contraction.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.884
What do I do? What do I do?
What do I do?

14:43.883 --> 14:45.977
Okay, deep breaths, Luanne,
like we practiced.

14:45.968 --> 14:48.391
You're in a wheat field.
There's a gentle breeze...

14:48.388 --> 14:54.942
Okay, a breezy,
painful wheat field.

14:54.936 --> 14:56.688
Lots of wheat, lots of pain.

14:56.687 --> 14:57.654
I hate this wheat field!

14:57.814 --> 14:59.691
I think I need to walk around.

14:59.690 --> 15:03.069
Excellent. It's good to walk around
during the beginning stages of labor.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.662
"Beginning?"

15:07.156 --> 15:09.705
Myrna, would you get
me the Enya CD?

15:09.700 --> 15:10.952
You'll need something stronger.

15:10.952 --> 15:12.704
I'll get chanting monks.

15:12.703 --> 15:13.670
Aunt Peggy?

15:14.705 --> 15:16.707
Can I talk to you?

15:16.707 --> 15:18.709
Get me out of here now.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.256
Consider it done.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.312
We are busting Luanne
out of here

15:30.304 --> 15:32.398
and getting her to a hospital.

15:32.390 --> 15:33.687
Hold on a minute, there.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.685
What if she gives
birth in my truck?

15:35.685 --> 15:38.609
You know there's a limit
to what Armor-All can do.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.902
I hate this!

15:40.898 --> 15:42.946
Hank, this is happening
with or without you.

15:44.694 --> 15:46.241
Bobby, you need
to cause a distraction.

15:46.237 --> 15:47.659
Do you think you can do that?

15:47.822 --> 15:50.666
A chance to flex
my improv muscles.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.205
I like it.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.454
Mm-mm, wait for
Luanne's signal.

16:00.334 --> 16:04.635
Um, Myrna, um, can you get
my floaties from my purse?

16:04.797 --> 16:06.765
I can't swim so good.

16:08.718 --> 16:12.848
It's hard to believe in just
a few hours, we'll have a baby.

16:12.847 --> 16:15.475
And you'll be thin again.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.647
Bobby, now!

16:17.685 --> 16:19.983
Cannonball!
No!

16:21.397 --> 16:22.569
What are you doing?

16:22.565 --> 16:23.691
Get out of there!

16:23.691 --> 16:25.910
This is what happens
when you give kids juice!

16:25.902 --> 16:28.655
You're tainting
the birthing tub!

16:32.325 --> 16:34.703
Double meat meal, please.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.545
Bill? Is that you?
Where have you been?

16:36.537 --> 16:38.460
Not that it's
any of your business,

16:38.456 --> 16:40.129
but I had lunch at a Luly's...

16:40.124 --> 16:41.967
and it was delicious.

16:41.959 --> 16:45.429
Oh, really? Mm-hmm. They know
how to treat a guy there.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.139
What are we doing?

16:47.131 --> 16:50.601
Why are we trying to hurt each other?
I don't know. I miss us.

16:50.593 --> 16:52.891
I miss us, too.
I can be there in an hour.

16:52.887 --> 16:55.390
What are you waiting for, honey?

16:55.389 --> 16:57.016
Hmm.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.692
What's going on, Baby Doll?

17:01.687 --> 17:03.360
Where are we going?

17:03.356 --> 17:06.280
We are taking Luanne away from
this glorified hot tub club

17:06.275 --> 17:07.446
to a proper hospital.

17:07.443 --> 17:08.694
I want to go someplace

17:08.694 --> 17:10.992
where there's doctors and
nurses and painkillers.

17:10.988 --> 17:13.707
Now, Luanne, we
thought this through.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.416
Myrna said a birthing center

17:15.409 --> 17:18.162
was the first step
on the road to a perfect baby.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.880
Oh, I am getting
in this truck, Lucky.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.671
And you can either come with me
or you can stay here with Myrna.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.632
I will stick by my mate.

17:25.795 --> 17:29.220
Which, by the way, is precisely
what a monkey would do.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.761
She's onto us! Let's roll!

17:32.760 --> 17:35.513
All right, everybody in.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.603
I will check you in.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.272
Then I'll go chat up
the janitor.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.111
They're the ones who
really run these places.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.444
You know what I think about

17:49.443 --> 17:52.242
when I accidentally smack
myself with a hammer?

17:52.238 --> 17:53.615
The Cowboys.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.287
Maybe you should think
about the Cowboys.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.959
I hope I'm doing
the right thing, Uncle Hank.

17:59.954 --> 18:02.673
Everyone keeps giving me advice.

18:02.665 --> 18:06.545
I have ideas, too, but no one
wants to listen to 'em.

18:06.544 --> 18:09.013
Well, this is your baby, Luanne.

18:09.005 --> 18:11.303
No one else is gonna
raise it for you,

18:11.299 --> 18:13.677
especially not your aunt and me.

18:13.676 --> 18:16.680
Maybe it's about time you
started thinking for yourself.

18:16.679 --> 18:18.977
Sometimes I can't tell
the difference

18:18.973 --> 18:21.943
between thinking and being
quiet, but I'll try.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.153
Well, you're gonna
make mistakes.

18:24.145 --> 18:26.568
Lord knows I must have
made some with Bobby,

18:26.564 --> 18:29.693
judging by some of the
asinine stuff he does.

18:29.692 --> 18:32.286
But you have to start somewhere.

18:33.529 --> 18:34.781
Luanne, stop.

18:34.989 --> 18:36.332
We need to get you out of
here before it's too late.

18:36.532 --> 18:39.706
Actually, Myrna, we've decided
we're giving birth here.

18:39.702 --> 18:41.454
That's right, Myrna.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.706
They have decided

18:42.705 --> 18:44.048
to give birth the right way,

18:44.040 --> 18:45.713
the Peggy way.

18:45.708 --> 18:48.712
No. Wait.

18:48.711 --> 18:50.930
I don't want to do
this your way either.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.673
I want to do this my way.

18:54.008 --> 18:57.683
I love you so much, Aunt Peggy,
and I want your advice,

18:57.678 --> 19:00.181
but, Lucky and I need
to do this on our own.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.606
I will be right in the waiting
room if you need me.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.445
I know you will.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.156
Let's go have a baby.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.242
And maybe a huge settlement.

19:11.233 --> 19:14.658
There will be lots of things to
slip on when this is all over.

19:30.961 --> 19:33.259
Jane?

19:33.255 --> 19:34.632
Bill?

19:35.716 --> 19:38.344
You didn't tell me
you were so... old.

19:38.344 --> 19:41.063
You didn't tell me
you were so young.

19:41.055 --> 19:43.399
I'm not young. I'm 17.

19:43.391 --> 19:45.610
I'm just gonna drive home now.

19:45.768 --> 19:47.645
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

20:05.705 --> 20:09.630
I tell you what, this Goofus
fellow is a dumb-ass.

20:09.792 --> 20:10.964
Look at me,

20:10.960 --> 20:13.338
I'm on a Japanese subway!

20:17.341 --> 20:19.389
It's a girl.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.479
And she's beautiful.

20:24.849 --> 20:27.693
This is one good-looking baby.

20:27.685 --> 20:29.687
They did a great job
cleaning her up.

20:29.687 --> 20:32.031
Ooh, you're a little cute one,
I tell you what.

20:32.022 --> 20:36.072
She bears a strong resemblance
to my side of the family.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.571
Course that might change
once she gets teeth.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.708
So, what's her name?

20:42.700 --> 20:45.704
Well, we have decided
to name her

20:45.703 --> 20:48.673
after one of our favorite
things...

20:48.831 --> 20:51.050
Lasagna.
What?!

20:51.041 --> 20:53.715
Lasagna Kleinschmidt.

20:53.711 --> 20:55.679
They gave you
the good stuff, didn't they?

20:55.671 --> 20:59.050
No, we just like
the name Lasagna.

20:59.049 --> 21:01.723
There is no way I'm gonna sit by

21:01.719 --> 21:03.517
and let you name
your child after...

21:03.512 --> 21:06.311
Luanne needs to make her
own decisions from now on.

21:06.307 --> 21:09.436
But no, honey, her name
is not going to be Lasagna.

21:52.061 --> 21:53.779
