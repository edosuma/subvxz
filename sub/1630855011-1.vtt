It's Christmas tomorrow.

19:35.732 --> 19:36.934
Another year gone.

19:38.638 --> 19:39.874
Since last year, it feels

19:39.874 --> 19:41.409
like I've grown ten years,
not one.

19:42.980 --> 19:45.785
This place more and more
is Hell.

My brothers and sisters.

before it could twist their guts

20:13.006 --> 20:15.377
and burn their brains
and corrode their bellies.

I am guessing you are the cause
of the cannons.

20:22.993 --> 20:23.995
MAGWITCH: One of the causes.

20:24.463 --> 20:26.834
There are two causes
out on these marshes tonight.

20:27.201 --> 20:30.307
One's a lost cause,
the other a just cause.

20:30.876 --> 20:31.911
Which are you?

20:32.345 --> 20:34.817
(GRUNTS) You're
a bold little boy, aren't you?

20:35.919 --> 20:37.823
Now, you hear me,
little boy.

20:37.823 --> 20:39.627
I'm a Christian soul.
I'm in need of help,

20:39.627 --> 20:40.728
and you're going
to give it to me!

20:41.062 --> 20:43.501
I'm an animal
and my belly's empty.

20:43.802 --> 20:47.008
You... You want food?
I have some bread in my pocket.

20:47.008 --> 20:48.377

21:01.036 --> 21:02.906
I'm sorry.
I saved some nails.

21:03.273 --> 21:04.777
I work in a blacksmith's shop.

21:04.777 --> 21:06.479
My sister is married
to a blacksmith.

21:07.983 --> 21:09.520
You live in
a blacksmith shop,

21:09.520 --> 21:11.322
so I know exactly where
to find you.

21:11.690 --> 21:12.893
Do you understand me?

21:14.930 --> 21:17.503
Well, here's what you're going
to do, blacksmith boy.

21:17.503 --> 21:19.674
You're going to meet me at
the twisted trees on the marsh.

21:19.674 --> 21:20.708
You know them?

21:21.409 --> 21:22.913
Well, you're going
to meet me there at first light.

21:22.913 --> 21:24.584
You're going to bring me
food and drink.

21:24.584 --> 21:26.452
And strong drink,
for the cold.

21:26.921 --> 21:28.691
Oh, and you go
to the blacksmith shop,

21:29.159 --> 21:30.962
and you're going to take
a metal file and pinchers.

21:31.263 --> 21:32.732
And you're going to bring
all of this to me.

21:33.066 --> 21:35.972
Well, now you do as you're told,
and I'll spare your life.

21:37.709 --> 21:41.082
If you decide to turn me over,
if you decide to turn me over,

21:41.584 --> 21:45.424
I'll find you, and your sister,
and your blacksmith,

21:45.726 --> 21:46.928
and there'll be three
more gravestones

21:46.928 --> 21:48.330
set beside these ones.

similar jewelry on his legs?

No, I saw no one.

to kill him?

We were talking only yesterday
about those very ingredients,

30:50.582 --> 30:53.320

30:53.320 --> 30:56.058
the most important ingredient
was love.

We did, Joe.

take the coats.

31:03.073 --> 31:05.945
I have an extra special treat
for us today,

31:05.945 --> 31:08.617
which I made myself
by hand.

31:09.485 --> 31:11.222
It's a savory pork pie.

Made from pastry
light as a linnet,

another typical example

chooses the easy, the obvious.

I already have your attention.

33:25.357 --> 33:27.161
MR. WOPSLE: The sermon
I would have given

33:27.161 --> 33:30.233
would have been about the fate
of those who are gluttonous.

33:30.233 --> 33:32.805
A fiery warning
against gluttony.

33:35.611 --> 33:38.517
PIP: And inspired by this
pronouncement against gluttony,

33:38.918 --> 33:41.422

from finishing my meal.

33:59.526 --> 34:00.794
No, I'm not.

34:01.529 --> 34:03.199
Perhaps I should go
and get some air.

34:03.199 --> 34:04.870
SARA: There's plenty of air
in this room.

34:04.870 --> 34:05.805
We have people.

34:06.205 --> 34:08.611
MR. PUMBLECHOOK: And besides,
Pip, you can't leave just yet.

34:08.611 --> 34:10.581
- I have some news.
- SARA: What news?

34:10.782 --> 34:13.320
Excellent news, Mrs. Gargery.

34:13.320 --> 34:15.323
As a successful chandler
and seed merchant,

34:15.725 --> 34:19.265
I have dealings with those
fortunate enough to live uptown,

34:19.265 --> 34:23.206
as well as those who are
unfortunate enough to live here.

over the bridge.

With messages, Mr. Gargery.

34:34.462 --> 34:37.467
From high to low.

34:37.735 --> 34:39.404
There is a lady
who lives uptown.

34:39.606 --> 34:41.375
Very far uptown.

34:41.677 --> 34:43.246
None of you
will have met her,

34:43.246 --> 34:44.882
yet all of you will
have heard of her.

34:45.684 --> 34:46.686
Miss Havisham.

34:48.322 --> 34:50.193
The lady who lives
in the haunted house?

34:50.193 --> 34:51.563
(LAUGHTER)

34:51.563 --> 34:54.535
Pip, what with red berries
and hauntings?

34:54.736 --> 34:55.704
What's become of you?

34:55.704 --> 34:58.677
And what business does
she have with our Pip?

34:59.078 --> 35:00.615
Thirteen years ago,

35:00.615 --> 35:03.553
Miss Havisham decided
to adopt a baby girl.

35:03.920 --> 35:07.628
Now, Miss Havisham has decided
that this girl needs company.

35:08.329 --> 35:11.836
Someone of a similar age,
but of the opposite... sex.

35:12.672 --> 35:16.212
Mr. Pumblechook, she did not use
that awful word, did she?

35:16.212 --> 35:18.282
- MR. PUMBLECHOOK: Sex, yes.
- Oh, this lady.

35:18.517 --> 35:19.485
There is no one

Since we can't find a,

35:30.273 --> 35:32.277
uh, boy
of the appropriate class,

35:32.512 --> 35:35.618
we've decided to find
the cleverest boy of that age

35:35.618 --> 35:36.720
in the parish.

for the boy?

35:40.528 --> 35:42.698
I mean, money.
Will she pay money?

35:42.965 --> 35:44.669
She'll pay a sum
to the boy's parents.

35:44.903 --> 35:46.906
And to the go-between, who is
the agent of the agreement.

35:47.340 --> 35:50.447
But, Mr. Pumblechook,
I need Pip in the shop.

35:50.447 --> 35:53.285
SARA: Do go on, Mr. Pumblechook.
How much will she pay?

35:53.620 --> 35:55.456
Mr. Wopsle,
you mentioned pigs earlier.

35:55.958 --> 35:57.060
Yes, pigs.

35:57.060 --> 36:00.299
I think this little piglet
will fetch quite a price.

36:01.670 --> 36:03.373
Now, before we begin

36:03.373 --> 36:04.942
the confidential conversation
of money,

36:05.243 --> 36:06.479
you mentioned something

36:06.479 --> 36:08.315
about an exceptional
savory pork pie.

36:08.517 --> 36:10.588
SARA: Oh!
I will fetch the pie.

goes to the little piglet.
