<i>--issued a series of clarifications of
several of the president's statements...</i>

00:30.004 --> 00:33.171
<i>...at his nationally televised
news conference last night.</i>

00:33.341 --> 00:36.176
<i>In addition to responding
to an abortion question...</i>

00:36.343 --> 00:38.716
<i>... with a three-minute answer
about taxes...</i>

00:38.888 --> 00:42.387
<i>...and confusing his attorney general
with his chief of staff...</i>

00:43.768 --> 00:46.175
<i>... the president forgot
Hawaii is a state...</i>

00:46.353 --> 00:50.730
<i>...referring to it as "one of our strongest
allies in the Pacific."</i>

00:50.899 --> 00:53.224
<i>A spokesman explained
that the president...</i>

00:53.401 --> 00:57.529
<i>...had been thrown off by the intensity
of the previous question.</i>

00:57.697 --> 01:02.027
<i>And finally, FBI agents have arrested
Air Force Sgt. Michael Prescott...</i>

01:02.202 --> 01:06.863
<i>...in connection with a plot to sell
weapon secrets to a foreign government.</i>

01:07.039 --> 01:11.452
<i>Prescott was arrested last night
in a Staten Island supermarket.</i>

<i>In weather, the city remains
in the grip of a cold spell.</i>

01:15.131 --> 01:18.333
<i>Central Park temperature

<i>The current midtown temperature

"more music" station.</i>

01:56.085 --> 01:58.078
How about some heat?

01:58.254 --> 02:00.924
I'm not an Eskimo.

02:46.426 --> 02:50.755
Hey, Mr. Finzi, how you doing, man?
Looking good! Looking good.

02:50.930 --> 02:53.930
-Gotcha!
-Gotcha. All right.

02:55.225 --> 02:58.261
MAN: Miss Terry, good morning.
-Good morning.

02:58.437 --> 03:01.805
-How you doing? I want a tulip.
-Tulip.

MAN:
Morning.

04:05.125 --> 04:06.916
Good morning.

04:07.084 --> 04:08.544
Morning, Terry.

04:08.712 --> 04:14.630
Larry, Larry, Larry! You get any closer,
honey, you're gonna be a father.

04:15.050 --> 04:16.759
You dog.

04:16.928 --> 04:17.959
LARRY:
Dog's job.

04:18.137 --> 04:20.463
Welcome to the boredom capital
of the world.

04:22.058 --> 04:23.884
-Morning, Mr. Page.
-Morning, Fred.

04:24.059 --> 04:28.602
Good morning, Mr. Page.
Looking good. Nice suit.

04:30.524 --> 04:31.804
I don't get it.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.482
God!

04:35.029 --> 04:38.728
Forty goddamn people in the office,
the man's gotta pick on me.

04:38.907 --> 04:40.187
Can't even say good morning.

04:40.367 --> 04:41.612
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

04:41.785 --> 04:46.446
-So did you sleep well last night?
-Yeah, aside from freezing my ass off.

04:46.622 --> 04:49.742
-I didn't.
-Really? Again?

04:50.877 --> 04:53.581
-Okay, give.
-A very nice man.

04:53.754 --> 04:58.332
His name was Richard.... Something
Italian. Anyway, he used to be a doctor.

04:58.508 --> 05:00.667
Still would be
if he had smarter lawyers.

05:00.844 --> 05:05.388
Richard-something-ltalian?
Monday, it was Nick-something-Greek.

05:05.557 --> 05:09.472
I liked him very much, but you
have to set high goals for yourself.

05:09.644 --> 05:13.642
-Let's face it, he was no ex-doctor.
-Ex-doctors do not grow on trees.

05:13.815 --> 05:16.650
-Hi, Karen.
-Oh, thanks for fixing my monitor.

05:16.943 --> 05:20.892
You can make fun of me all you like,
but at least I am out there...

05:21.071 --> 05:24.855
...I'm making an effort. You won't
meet anybody by sitting home....

05:25.033 --> 05:26.528
-Morning ladies.
-Dougie!

05:26.702 --> 05:27.733
-Terry!
-Dougie!

05:27.912 --> 05:28.942
-Terry!
-Hey!

05:29.955 --> 05:33.905
Hey, ready to saddle up,
ride the wild software?

05:34.084 --> 05:37.084
Hey, Cynthia. You know that guy
you were with at Cole's last night?

05:37.254 --> 05:40.669
<i>-Yeah.
-I saw him on 60 Minutes doing this:</i>

05:40.840 --> 05:42.916
"No pictures, no comments. "

05:43.093 --> 05:44.752
Doug, that's so amusing.

05:44.927 --> 05:49.007
-Why do you do this to her?
-He knows it drives me up the wall.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.055
I do it because you fall for it.

05:51.225 --> 05:54.594
He's shopping at Walgreens.
He's got his Brut collection.

05:54.770 --> 05:58.436
-At least I'm always ready for the ladies.
-Hey, man, try some soap.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.849
I did. It got lonely.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.102
Sick. You're sick. Okay.

06:04.779 --> 06:08.314
Confirm transfer to First National.

<i>TERRY:

06:24.215 --> 06:26.255
<i>Bonjour,
Terry.</i>

06:26.426 --> 06:29.379
<i>Look at this. He says,
"Bonjour. What's the skinny?"</i>

06:29.553 --> 06:31.712
Am I teaching him,
or am I teaching him?

06:31.889 --> 06:34.048
-"What's the skinny?"
-What's the skinny?

06:34.225 --> 06:38.637
-What's the skinny? What's the buzz?
-Oh, yeah, I knew what it was.

06:39.730 --> 06:43.810
TERRY: How did everything work out
with Paulette?

06:45.235 --> 06:49.777
"Made love all weekend"?
God, I gotta meet this guy.

06:49.948 --> 06:53.233
You shouldn't chitchat.
You're gonna get in trouble.

06:53.742 --> 06:54.774
Terry!

06:56.078 --> 06:57.738
Terry!

06:59.122 --> 07:01.032
False alarm.

07:01.208 --> 07:05.419
TERRY: I knew it. This is code for,
"Terry, come adjust my chair. "

07:05.587 --> 07:09.799
Now, you're gonna have this baby.
It's gonna have a head like the monitor.

07:09.967 --> 07:13.584
It's gonna say "Sperry"
across the top of it, and you know--

07:13.762 --> 07:15.920
There she is, Miss Russian Aerobics!

07:16.139 --> 07:17.931
TERRY:
Oh, not again.

07:18.099 --> 07:22.346
-This is the third time this week.
-Russian TV piped into Terry's monitor.

07:22.520 --> 07:25.605
Every time I turn around,
this chick is on my monitor.

07:26.149 --> 07:28.187
CYNTHIA:
I hate to see a woman like that.

07:28.359 --> 07:29.735
FRED:
What a woman.

07:29.902 --> 07:33.317
-Larry, your girlfriend's here.
FRED: Don't tell him. He'll defect.

07:33.488 --> 07:36.062
DOUG: Is that a woman?
WOMAN: I wish I could do that.

07:36.242 --> 07:39.077
-I'm not gonna watch.
-Look at that nick on her leg!

07:39.244 --> 07:41.201
Don't shave with a sickle, baby.

07:41.371 --> 07:43.411
Cut it out. Turn my knobs, please.

07:43.582 --> 07:46.073
FRED: She'd crush bowling balls
between those thighs.

07:46.251 --> 07:51.043
-I'm getting seriously aroused here.
-The shielding on the I/O port is loose.

07:51.214 --> 07:53.966
-How's that?
-I don't know how you know to do that.

07:54.133 --> 07:56.292
It's like an electrical gift.

07:56.469 --> 07:58.378
FRED:
I know where all our wheat went.

07:58.554 --> 07:59.585
Aw!

07:59.763 --> 08:02.171
<i>It's almost time
for Leave It to Brezhnev.</i>

08:02.349 --> 08:04.342
<i>No, it's time for Gilligan's Gulag.</i>

08:04.518 --> 08:05.847
Terry.

08:06.020 --> 08:08.262
-Mr. Page would like to see you.
-Uh-oh.

08:09.189 --> 08:12.807
Well, I'm standing right here.
It's not like he could miss me.

08:12.984 --> 08:15.310
MR. PAGE:
Miss Doolittle, in my office right now.

08:15.487 --> 08:18.274
CYNTHIA: She fixed it.
WOMAN: What's she in trouble for?

08:18.489 --> 08:21.325
I can accept certain
of your eccentricities...

08:21.493 --> 08:24.410
...because you're one of my
most productive employees.

08:24.579 --> 08:26.073
Thank you, Mr. Page.

08:26.247 --> 08:28.820
However, these are your printouts
for last week.

08:28.999 --> 08:32.166
How would you define your job here,
Miss Doolittle?

08:32.336 --> 08:34.909
To transfer funds,
accept transfer of funds...

08:35.089 --> 08:37.758
...between international
banking establishments...

08:37.924 --> 08:42.301
...using the computer so that the
transferred funds are easily called upon.

08:42.471 --> 08:44.842
How were you taught
to end a transmission?

08:45.224 --> 08:48.888
-I enter the phrase, "end trans."
-And yet look here.

08:49.061 --> 08:53.010
Look how you ended your transmission
to Mr. Dennis Bramlett...

08:53.190 --> 08:55.347
...of Barclays Bank
of London last week.

08:55.524 --> 09:00.270
"Dennis, will trade you my Springsteen
bootleg for your Moot the Hoople. "

09:00.446 --> 09:03.946
Mott the Hoople. He's a Springsteen fan.
I entered "end trans. "

09:04.116 --> 09:07.366
And then there's Mr. loto
of the Hansu Tokyo Bank.

09:07.537 --> 09:10.324
I believe this is a recipe
for a Yankee pot roast.

09:10.498 --> 09:12.823
A man gets tired
of raw fish all the time.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.914
And I'm not even going to begin to
discuss your advice to Jean-Claude.

09:17.087 --> 09:19.495
Perhaps I should call you Dr. Ruth!

09:19.881 --> 09:24.342
-Mr. Page, I was trying to be friendly.
-Computers are not friendly.

09:24.510 --> 09:28.840
-I'm not a computer, Mr. Page.
-From 9 to 6, five days a week, you are.

09:29.015 --> 09:33.511
You'll represent this bank professionally,
or you will not represent it at all!

09:33.686 --> 09:35.643
End trans?

09:35.855 --> 09:37.931
End trans.

09:52.287 --> 09:56.783
Hi, Fritz. How is the missus?

10:02.880 --> 10:04.838
-Delete, delete...
DOUG: Six o'clock!

10:05.007 --> 10:07.794
-...delete, delete, delete, delete....
-Karen!

10:07.968 --> 10:09.878
FRED:
Enjoy your party, dreamboat.

10:10.054 --> 10:13.553
-Call us when the baby comes.
-Jackie, good luck with your baby.

10:13.724 --> 10:16.131
Fred and I chipped in most
for your present.

10:17.185 --> 10:20.306
TERRY:
End trans.

10:23.192 --> 10:25.516
JACKIE:
Well, I won't miss you.

10:25.694 --> 10:27.567
FRED:
Karen, we'll see you later at Cole's.

10:27.737 --> 10:31.153
Could you tell my replacement
I ordered another chair?

10:31.324 --> 10:33.815
And it should be in
by the end of the month.

10:34.577 --> 10:35.691
Sure.

10:37.288 --> 10:41.202
-Thanks for everything, Terry.
-Oh, come on, don't cry.

10:41.375 --> 10:43.119
Come on.

10:45.003 --> 10:48.124
Hey, now, wipe your eyes, huh?
Makeup's running.

10:48.299 --> 10:51.252
People gonna think somebody
hit you in the eye, girl.

10:51.426 --> 10:53.917
Where's the party, baby?
I'm waddling over.

10:54.095 --> 10:55.554
Right behind you.

10:55.722 --> 11:00.135
You waddle on in.
I'll be waddling on in myself.

11:11.820 --> 11:14.192
CYNTHIA: Speaking of bows....
KAREN: It's beautiful.

11:14.364 --> 11:16.571
She'll know this is a stroller.

11:16.742 --> 11:20.442

Wait, wait, wait. Look, look.

WOMAN:
Heidi, get your present.

11:22.205 --> 11:26.749
-What is that? One of your friends?
-No, no. They all know I go down by 6.

11:27.294 --> 11:31.208
I bet it's Mr. Page.
He's testing you, yeah.

11:31.381 --> 11:35.378
He sent that message from upstairs.
Now he's lurking behind his monitor...

11:35.551 --> 11:37.758
...waiting for you
to give him an answer.

11:39.889 --> 11:42.760
"Jumping Jack Flash"
does not sound like Mr. Page.

11:42.934 --> 11:45.092
He's more your Don Ho type.

11:45.269 --> 11:49.480
Terry, you do not need any more trouble.
It defeats your own purpose.

11:49.648 --> 11:52.649
-I'll be there in a second.
-Then we'll go to Cole's?

11:52.817 --> 11:56.400
-Yes. I promise.
-All right. Now, hurry!

11:58.657 --> 12:02.654

16:33.751 --> 16:36.040
I was crowned...

16:36.212 --> 16:38.833
...with a spike through my head?

16:41.299 --> 16:44.005
This has got some weird-ass lyrics!

17:00.734 --> 17:06.320
I was drowned in a four, five city hag.

17:06.781 --> 17:10.650
Mick, Mick, Mick, speak English!

17:52.742 --> 17:55.613
MR. PAGE: Miss Doolittle.
-Oh, Mr. Page.

17:55.787 --> 17:58.159
What are you doing?
Communicating with pals?

17:58.331 --> 18:01.746
Recipes? More advice
to the sexually inadequate?

18:01.917 --> 18:05.500
Oh, no. You know, we've been
so backlogged since Jackie left...

18:05.671 --> 18:08.340
...I thought I'd catch up
on her British deposits.

18:08.507 --> 18:13.465
-Really? Well, color me so surprised.
-Oh, you're so witty.

18:13.637 --> 18:16.009
-May I see these transactions--?
-Look!

18:16.181 --> 18:18.589
I've got to have that promotion.

18:18.767 --> 18:21.554
I've gotta have it.
Mr. Page, oh, please.

18:21.728 --> 18:23.520
Miss Doolittle, grab ahold of yourself.

18:23.688 --> 18:24.933
-Mr. Page?
-Yes.

18:25.106 --> 18:28.356
-Can I go home now?
-Yes, go home. By all means, go home.

18:28.527 --> 18:30.565
-Mrs. Milsap is watching.
-Please!

18:30.736 --> 18:34.070
You'll get that promotion provided
you keep working this way.

18:34.240 --> 18:38.024
I'm proud of this effort you're
putting in. Lisa, I'll walk with you.

18:38.202 --> 18:39.317
LISA:
Walk with Larry.

18:39.495 --> 18:43.907
You go home, Mr. Page. I don't
want you to see me like this no more.

18:44.082 --> 18:48.127
Go, Mr. Page.
Go to the wife and kiddies.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.834
Good night.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.677
Right on time.

18:58.263 --> 19:01.762
Okay, let's break this mother.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.302
Crossfire.

19:05.687 --> 19:09.434
See, I didn't think it was crossfire.
I know it's hurricane.

19:11.192 --> 19:13.730
Rain? No.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.610
Gas?

19:16.822 --> 19:18.232
Toothless?

19:18.406 --> 19:21.657
Back? Bearded?

19:22.285 --> 19:24.278
Howled?

19:24.746 --> 19:29.574
Okay, how about
Copyright 1968 ABKCO Music Inc.?

19:29.751 --> 19:33.749
Oh, I give this up
because now you pissed me off.

19:33.921 --> 19:37.171
Okay, think. I'm a Stone fan,
he's a Stone fan.

19:37.342 --> 19:40.544
So it has to be something
that says Stones.

19:40.719 --> 19:42.095
Drugs.

19:43.014 --> 19:45.718
Okay. Let's talk.

19:45.891 --> 19:51.644
What about the women? Bianca.
What about Jerry Hall?

19:53.899 --> 19:58.726
What's her name? What's her name?
Marianne Faithfull.

19:59.070 --> 20:02.938
What else? What else? Jagger?
Not his ass.

20:03.116 --> 20:05.785
His lips.

20:07.578 --> 20:09.322
Okay.

20:09.497 --> 20:11.536
Tongue.

20:11.707 --> 20:13.700
Goddamn!

20:14.710 --> 20:16.951
Altamont.

20:18.088 --> 20:19.666
Shit!

20:19.840 --> 20:22.378
I don't have time
to waste like this.

20:22.551 --> 20:25.801
It's not like I got nothing else
to do, you know?

20:45.406 --> 20:47.731
I got you now.

20:48.075 --> 20:54.279
I got you, man. I did not flunk
out of chorus for nothing.

21:00.086 --> 21:04.000
B-Flat.

21:04.257 --> 21:06.499
You know I'm right.

21:17.061 --> 21:22.399
Yes! Kicking ass! Get it,
get it, get it! Terry! Terry!

21:25.903 --> 21:27.694
Yes!

21:30.407 --> 21:34.985
B-motherfucking-flat!
This is like acid on Sunday.

21:35.162 --> 21:36.192
Come on, now.

21:39.332 --> 21:42.866
Knew I could do it, huh?
You son of a bitch.

21:43.044 --> 21:45.665
Did I pass the test?

21:45.838 --> 21:47.629
"You're smart. That'll help. "

21:48.048 --> 21:49.507
Who are you?

21:50.092 --> 21:54.220
"Must be brief.
Destroy all copies of transmission.

21:54.388 --> 21:57.139
Do not reveal code key to any--"

21:57.683 --> 22:01.016
Who am I gonna tell the code key to?

22:02.854 --> 22:06.437
Why all the mystery?
"Am in serious trouble."

22:08.150 --> 22:10.476
What kind of trouble?

22:10.987 --> 22:13.312
And is it gonna visit my house?

22:13.531 --> 22:17.529
"Could you deliver message
to the British Consulate?"

22:17.702 --> 22:19.990
Think they're gonna
let me in the door?

22:20.704 --> 22:22.246
"Need your help.

22:22.414 --> 22:24.656
Ask for Department C.

22:24.833 --> 22:30.040
Would be grateful if you said yes."
What's the message?

22:32.216 --> 22:36.628
"Dog's barking.
Can't fly without umbrella."

22:37.971 --> 22:41.220
Are you shitting me? Come on.

22:41.391 --> 22:43.549
I'm not saying that.

22:43.726 --> 22:48.388
I can't go to some damn consulate
and talk about dogs. Are you kid--?

23:06.790 --> 23:09.459
MAN 1: There you are.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

23:09.626 --> 23:14.003
MAN 2: What are you doing? There's
a million mannequins in the basement.

23:14.171 --> 23:15.500
MAN 1:
We have a lot of balls.

23:15.674 --> 23:18.080
So, what's going on here?

23:18.258 --> 23:22.257
Oh, we're getting ready for the Queen's
Anniversary Ball next Monday.

23:22.430 --> 23:26.344
Miss Doolittle? I'm Jeremy Talbot.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

23:26.517 --> 23:28.889
RECEPTIONIST:
The British Consulate. May I help you?

23:30.145 --> 23:32.185
Come here.

23:33.898 --> 23:36.650
Dog's barking.
Can't fly without umbrella.

23:38.111 --> 23:40.234
Excuse me?

23:41.781 --> 23:44.402
-Dog's bark--
-Yes, I heard you.

23:44.575 --> 23:48.027
-But I don't quite follow.
-Aren't you from Department C?

23:48.204 --> 23:49.614
No, I'm not.

23:49.788 --> 23:53.786
You need to get somebody down here
from Department C. They'd understand.

23:53.959 --> 23:57.494
I'm afraid we don't have
a Department C, Miss Doolittle.

23:57.671 --> 23:59.629
You do! I asked the receptionist.

23:59.798 --> 24:02.633
I told her I had a message
for Department C.

24:02.801 --> 24:05.209
She got on the phone,
and then you showed up.

24:05.470 --> 24:08.139
Who was the message from?

24:08.389 --> 24:10.382
Jumping Jack Flash.

24:11.142 --> 24:13.016
What?

24:14.271 --> 24:17.686
-Jumping Jack Flash.
-Jumping Jack Flash?

24:17.858 --> 24:20.348
Shh! You know him, right?

24:20.527 --> 24:23.362
"It's a gas, gas, gas." Rolling Stones.
I am English.

24:23.529 --> 24:27.063
Jeremy? Are we still on
for squash this afternoon?

24:27.241 --> 24:29.150
-Absolutely, 5:00.
-Super.

24:29.326 --> 24:31.284
I'm sorry I couldn't be more help.

24:31.453 --> 24:35.072
I feel awfully dumb, Mr. Talbot.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

24:35.249 --> 24:39.744
-Someone thought this was funny.
-Of course. Gillian.

24:39.961 --> 24:41.336
Hmm.

24:51.639 --> 24:55.719
Pressing that cancels the input buffer
line but leaves the template intact.

24:55.893 --> 24:57.303
-Fred, you're so smart.
-Yes.

24:57.477 --> 24:58.889
Smell me.

24:59.063 --> 25:01.055
What? What, what, what, what?

25:01.231 --> 25:04.435
-I said, smell me.
-Oh, God, do I have to?

25:04.610 --> 25:08.773
I met this guy, and he distributes
all these seconds and irregulars.

25:09.114 --> 25:11.486
There's no such thing
as perfume irregulars.

25:11.658 --> 25:12.938
Very humorous.

25:13.117 --> 25:15.691
My point is that this guy
has a friend, and--

25:15.870 --> 25:17.614
Afternoon, ladies.

25:17.789 --> 25:22.082
My point is this guy has a friend. They
want to take us out to dinner tonight.

25:22.251 --> 25:25.336
Tonight? Tonight, I can't.

25:25.505 --> 25:29.039
-I'm already involved with someone.
-What do you mean?

25:29.216 --> 25:32.585
-With who? Who is he?
-Oh, he's just a guy.

25:32.761 --> 25:36.344
I don't know that much about him.
I know that he likes the Stones.

25:36.515 --> 25:40.892
-He's something of a practical joker.
-That's so great!

25:41.060 --> 25:43.219
What am I gonna do?

25:43.396 --> 25:45.224
It's a package deal.

25:46.107 --> 25:47.899
Attention, please.
I would like you to join me...

25:48.068 --> 25:50.024
...in welcoming a new member
of our family:

25:50.194 --> 25:51.688
-Mr. Martin Phillips.
-Marty.

25:51.863 --> 25:54.353
-Who is replacing...
-Hi, Marty.

25:54.532 --> 25:58.744
...Miss Jackie Valentine
at terminal number 23.

25:58.911 --> 26:03.039
He comes from our Silver Springs office.
Welcome to the main branch.

26:03.207 --> 26:05.116
Thank you, Mr. Page.

26:06.043 --> 26:08.664
-Seems like a pretty loose guy.
-Oh, yeah.

26:08.837 --> 26:11.244
-That's my card. Feel free to call me.
-Thanks.

26:11.464 --> 26:12.709
-Hi.
-Hi.

26:12.924 --> 26:16.128
I'm Marty Phillips. My card.
Feel free to call me anytime.

26:16.303 --> 26:18.876
Terry Doolittle, and I will.

26:20.640 --> 26:22.882
-Don't sit!
-Oh!

26:23.101 --> 26:24.808
KAREN: Is he hurt?
-He fell.

26:24.978 --> 26:27.432
-Are you all right?
-Is this an initiation?

26:27.605 --> 26:31.769
I was supposed to tell you this was
the chair that the pregnant girl sat in.

26:31.943 --> 26:35.192
-It's adjusted for her.
-I should thank her for the job.

26:35.362 --> 26:37.687
Have a seat.
I'll adjust the chair for you.

26:37.864 --> 26:39.275
-Just don't lean back.
-Okay.

26:39.450 --> 26:40.861
-Hi.
-Hi.

26:41.035 --> 26:43.359
-Hi, I'm Cynthia.
-Cynthia, I'm Marty.

26:43.537 --> 26:45.778
Anything you need,
just pick up the phone.

26:45.955 --> 26:47.829
Really? I just might do that.

26:47.999 --> 26:52.911
I'd like to say that it's a pleasure
to welcome you to our little family.

26:53.796 --> 26:57.960
Oh, I see you already have a little family.

26:58.134 --> 27:00.803
Well, shit.

27:00.970 --> 27:03.378
Welcome anyway.

27:03.889 --> 27:05.798
Cute girls.

27:05.975 --> 27:09.141
-Yeah, it's too bad they're boys.
-There she is again!

27:09.311 --> 27:12.312
DOUG:
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait for me.

27:12.940 --> 27:14.766
She doesn't do it for me anymore.

27:14.941 --> 27:18.690
KAREN: Do strong women threaten you?
DOUG: No, they just beat me up.

27:18.862 --> 27:20.107
-Come on.
-What is that?

27:20.279 --> 27:24.574
Soviet TV uses the same satellite
as this capitalist pig bank.

27:24.743 --> 27:26.320
Lenin would have a stroke.

27:26.494 --> 27:27.573
Adjust my knobs.

27:27.745 --> 27:30.781
No! I wouldn't adjust that.
That's delicate technology.

27:30.956 --> 27:34.160
That should only be adjusted
by skilled technicians.

27:34.877 --> 27:36.953
Excuse me.

27:41.466 --> 27:43.459
MAN:
What's going on? Nothing's going on.

27:43.802 --> 27:46.887
Oh, yeah, this one girl Terry,
she's working late.

27:47.056 --> 27:50.175
I don't know. I guess
she wants a raise or something.

27:50.475 --> 27:52.883
No. She talks to herself
all the time.

27:53.979 --> 27:56.304
There you are.
Jesus, thank God.

27:56.523 --> 27:58.266
All right.

28:03.321 --> 28:04.898
Jack?

28:08.159 --> 28:13.034
Okay, pal, is this a big joke?

28:14.122 --> 28:17.657
"What did consulate say?"
What did it say?

28:17.835 --> 28:22.163
Consulate said, "No Department C."

28:23.048 --> 28:27.045
"Whom did you talk to?"
Oh, I just love your accent.

28:27.218 --> 28:30.753
Jeremy Talbot.
Says he didn't know you.

28:30.930 --> 28:33.504
But I have a feeling that he did.

28:34.684 --> 28:38.467
"Situation confusing. " No shit!

28:38.813 --> 28:42.478
What exactly is the situation?

28:44.276 --> 28:46.898
"Trapped in Eastern Europe.
Need exit."

28:47.070 --> 28:49.775
What about your passport?

28:51.574 --> 28:55.157
Who are you, Jack?

28:57.372 --> 28:58.535
"British Intellig--"?

29:05.546 --> 29:08.998
Why didn't you contact
the consulate yourself?

29:10.092 --> 29:12.843
"Did. Won't acknowledge me."
Why?

29:14.137 --> 29:15.418
"Excellent question."

29:23.605 --> 29:26.725
What else can I do?

29:27.025 --> 29:31.438
"Need other con--" Are you crazy?
Other contacts? I work in a bank.

29:31.613 --> 29:32.727
Who?

29:34.199 --> 29:39.537
"First go to my apartment in New York
and get something for me."

29:39.704 --> 29:45.160
God. What do you need, a trench coat?
A camera? Microfilm!

29:45.334 --> 29:47.374
Oh, what?

29:48.045 --> 29:49.871
"A frying pan."

29:50.047 --> 29:52.418
I'd have probably
thought about that next.

29:52.591 --> 29:55.296
Hey! You Miss Doolittle?

29:55.469 --> 29:57.710
Don't be sneaking up
on people like that.

29:57.888 --> 30:00.889
Sorry. It's been a long day.
I'm your Sperry repairman.

30:01.057 --> 30:03.513
-I'm here to check out your terminal.
-Oh.

30:03.685 --> 30:06.140
Didn't mean to scare you.

30:07.272 --> 30:10.225
-You're here a little late.
-I'm running behind.

30:10.399 --> 30:12.606
I need a little of that overtime action.

30:12.777 --> 30:15.185
-Nothing's wrong with my terminal.
-No?

30:15.363 --> 30:17.651
Well, I got a report that there was.

30:17.824 --> 30:20.029
-What's wrong with it?
-Oh, I don't know.

30:20.200 --> 30:22.773
Probably some kind of short,
chip, something.

30:22.952 --> 30:25.788
Well, I'd feel a lot better
if nobody messed with it.

30:25.956 --> 30:28.447
Come on. I've been
traveling for two hours.

30:28.625 --> 30:30.498
I can appreciate that fully, but--

30:30.668 --> 30:32.246
Weren't you about to leave?

30:32.421 --> 30:36.714
You don't mind if I just call Sperry?
I mean, just to check it out.

30:36.883 --> 30:39.587
-No. Go ahead. It's your dime.
-Okay.

30:39.760 --> 30:43.094
Ah, ah, ah! Don't mess with it.

30:53.356 --> 30:56.607
Hi, this is Terry Doolittle
down at First National.

30:56.777 --> 31:02.732
Who is this, Clovis? Clovis, I got a guy
here who says you sent him down.

31:02.991 --> 31:06.740
Yeah, let me ask him.
Say, what's your--?

31:13.335 --> 31:16.868
My mistake. Sorry.

31:26.263 --> 31:29.466
TERRY:
153. Pull over here.

31:32.394 --> 31:34.517
I'll only be a couple of minutes.

31:34.688 --> 31:36.846
Sure. As long as the meter's running.

31:50.035 --> 31:52.277
Key's in the hydrant,
just like he said.

32:07.636 --> 32:09.592
Hello?

32:13.891 --> 32:16.180
Anybody here?

32:17.228 --> 32:18.603
Wow.

32:18.771 --> 32:20.680
Nice pad!

32:22.275 --> 32:26.058
I'm not stealing anything.
I got a key from Jack.

32:26.237 --> 32:28.110
Hello?

32:28.655 --> 32:30.862
This is great.

32:31.032 --> 32:34.153
You know this cat
don't have no roaches.

32:34.494 --> 32:36.570
God.

32:36.747 --> 32:40.245
Maybe I ought to go
into the spy business.

32:40.876 --> 32:43.449
Nice system.

32:52.595 --> 32:53.876
Oh, Jesus!

33:01.645 --> 33:04.480
It's the phone.
It's just the phone.

33:06.525 --> 33:09.276
<i>This is Jack. Sorry to miss you.
Leave your name, number...</i>

33:09.444 --> 33:11.899
<i>...and I'll get back to you
soon as possible.</i>

33:12.071 --> 33:16.733
<i>And if you'd like to leave a message,
that would be good too. Okay, bye.</i>

33:17.076 --> 33:19.911
<i>-So that's what you sound like.
JACK: Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

33:20.079 --> 33:22.700
<i>Don 't forget to wait
for the beep, will you?</i>

33:22.873 --> 33:24.949
<i>It's a fairly long space,
but it's coming soon.</i>

33:28.253 --> 33:32.252
<i>Jacques, it's me again. You shit!
I'm sick of this machine! Forget it.</i>

33:32.425 --> 33:35.958
Jack, I wouldn't go with any woman
who called me a sheet.

33:37.846 --> 33:40.302
No, no, I won't.

33:44.603 --> 33:47.769
No, this is the man's private property.
I mean....

33:49.774 --> 33:51.482
Fuck it.

33:56.614 --> 33:59.449
<i>MAN 1: Jack, this is Curt
from Sport Motors. Car's ready.</i>

33:59.616 --> 34:02.190
<i>We put in new brakes,
and replaced the radio.</i>

34:02.369 --> 34:04.161
<i>Call when you wanna pick it up.</i>

34:04.330 --> 34:07.330
"Sarah. Sinai, '82. "

34:07.499 --> 34:08.744
<i>MAN 2:
Jack, it's Allen.</i>

34:08.917 --> 34:11.917
<i>Look, I got tickets for the Knicks
game tomorrow and--</i>

34:12.087 --> 34:14.208
<i>JACK:
Wait, Allen. Hang on. I'm here.</i>

34:14.422 --> 34:19.001
<i>ALLEN: You're screening your calls?
JACK: Yeah, let me switch this off.</i>

34:22.388 --> 34:26.005
<i>WOMAN: Hi, Jack. It's Liz. I'm worried
about Harry, okay? Please call.</i>

34:38.277 --> 34:42.226
In the oven! It's not here!
Oh!

34:46.870 --> 34:49.574
<i>MAN 3:
Jack, there's trouble. Call me.</i>

34:55.002 --> 34:56.995
<i>FRENCH WOMAN:
Jacques, it's me again.</i>

34:57.171 --> 35:01.749
<i>You shit! I'm sick of this machine!
Forget it!</i>

35:07.973 --> 35:11.223
Go, go! Let's go, let's go!

35:13.937 --> 35:15.265
Shut up!

35:16.022 --> 35:20.768
Sit back, relax. The meter is off.

35:48.762 --> 35:52.842
Okay, let's see.

35:53.016 --> 35:59.220
"Harry Carlson, Archer Lincoln,
Peter Caen, Mark Van Meter."

35:59.397 --> 36:02.351
I'm supposed to call these guys?

36:05.110 --> 36:07.103
Oh, shit.

36:23.920 --> 36:25.295
Oh.

36:26.214 --> 36:27.589
Okay.

36:32.220 --> 36:36.964
First up, Peter Caen.

36:37.558 --> 36:42.219
553-31 82.

36:45.524 --> 36:49.355
<i>WOMAN: Peter Caen residence.
-Hello, is Peter Caen in?</i>

36:49.528 --> 36:52.445
<i>No, this is his service.
May I take a message?</i>

36:52.614 --> 36:57.739
Yes, my name is Terry Doolittle.
He can reach me at 555--

36:59.454 --> 37:02.823
<i>-555, yes?
-7532.</i>

37:02.999 --> 37:06.201
<i>-7532. Thank you.
-Okay.</i>

37:10.214 --> 37:12.420
Fucking cats.

37:21.766 --> 37:22.798
<i>MAN:
Hello?</i>

37:22.976 --> 37:25.514
<i>-Is this Mr. Van Meter?
-Yes.</i>

37:25.687 --> 37:28.438
My name is Terry Doolittle.
I have a message...

37:28.606 --> 37:31.690
<i>-...from Jumping Jack Flash.
-I can meet in 20 minutes.</i>

37:31.860 --> 37:36.485
Is it possible to do this in the morning?
I've had the most amazing night.

37:36.655 --> 37:39.859
<i>I'm leaving for Brussels
on a 3 a.m. flight.</i>

37:40.034 --> 37:43.901
<i>-I think we should meet tonight.
-Okay. Where?</i>

37:46.999 --> 37:48.706
This is great. This is great.

37:48.875 --> 37:51.876
I mean, I'm down here 1:30
in the morning, on the docks!

37:52.045 --> 37:55.129
I should just pin a $ 100 bill
to my ass and scream:

37:55.298 --> 38:00.292
"Victim here! Victim here!"
Don't complain. Shut up, okay?

38:00.470 --> 38:02.214
VAN METER: A wise idea.
-You're right.

38:03.598 --> 38:04.629
Oh, shit.

38:08.310 --> 38:13.435
I apologize, Miss Doolittle. Procedure.

38:13.607 --> 38:16.228
But you understand, of course.

38:20.739 --> 38:23.312
-M-- Mr. Van Meter?
-Van Meter.

38:23.492 --> 38:26.030
-Yeah, yeah.
-Very nice of you to meet me here.

38:26.203 --> 38:28.694
-Thanks, thanks.
-You know the business.

38:28.914 --> 38:33.041
You scared me!
Jesus, man, do the world a favor!

38:33.209 --> 38:36.126
Get yourself an office
with a desk and a lamp!

38:36.295 --> 38:38.122
Let's walk.

38:39.382 --> 38:42.750
-Okay, who do you work for?
-First National Bank.

38:42.926 --> 38:47.423
-I don't mean your cover, your boss.
-James Page. Anal. Polyester king.

38:47.598 --> 38:49.424
So Page is Jack's contact?

38:49.599 --> 38:51.841
He's the schmuck I work for at the bank.

38:52.018 --> 38:55.637
I work in the money transfer room, man.
I work on a computer.

38:55.814 --> 38:59.265
You mean you're a civilian?
You don't know anything about this?

38:59.443 --> 39:01.435
I don't know dick about this!

39:01.611 --> 39:06.486
Except some guy calling himself Jumping
Jack Flash taps into my computer!

39:06.657 --> 39:09.492
Tells me to go to his house
and get a frying pan...

39:09.661 --> 39:12.780
...call Van Halen, Van Morrison,
I don't know. Van Meter!

39:12.955 --> 39:15.790
-Right, but you got a message.
-Yes, I got a message.

39:15.958 --> 39:20.121
And I took it over to the British
Consulate. I talked to Mr. Talbot.

39:20.296 --> 39:24.838
-This guy looked at me like I was crazy!
-What was the message?

39:26.844 --> 39:31.552
"Dog's barking. Can't fly without
umbrella. " It's silly, I know.

39:32.265 --> 39:34.970
I pray to God he's still alive.

39:39.480 --> 39:43.312
No, no. I just talked to him tonight.

39:43.484 --> 39:45.144
I mean....

39:45.319 --> 39:49.483
-You're being melodramatic, aren't you?
-I'm not.

39:51.325 --> 39:53.233
I'm sorry you got this involved.

39:53.452 --> 39:55.777
I couldn't help it.
The guy was all alone.

39:55.955 --> 39:59.039
Didn't wanna leave him.
How often does a girl like me...

39:59.249 --> 40:02.583
...get involved with something like this?
It's on my computer.

40:02.753 --> 40:05.872
I was thinking to myself--
You're moving awfully quickly.

40:06.089 --> 40:09.671
Mr. Van Meter, are you trying to catch
a plane? Mr. Van Meter?

40:18.225 --> 40:20.265
Mr. Van Meter?

40:22.521 --> 40:26.649
Mr. Van Meter? Mr. Van Met--?

40:35.200 --> 40:39.149
Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

40:55.678 --> 40:56.876
TERRY: There's a dead man
floating in the river!

40:57.054 --> 40:58.217
Tell me again.

40:58.389 --> 41:01.638
If you'd stop picking your teeth,
you could hear what I say.

41:01.808 --> 41:03.766
-Get the facts.
-What happened?

41:03.977 --> 41:07.560
I told them not to call anyone.
They found your card in my pocket.

41:07.731 --> 41:10.482
-You're wet.
-Really, Marty?

41:10.650 --> 41:12.773
God, you're so perceptive!

41:12.986 --> 41:14.777
-You know her?
-I work with her.

41:14.945 --> 41:16.144
She nuts?

41:16.363 --> 41:21.405
We found her screaming, soaking wet,
waving down cars near Battery Park.

41:21.618 --> 41:23.611
-What happened?
-Fell in the river.

41:23.829 --> 41:27.578
I told you, I didn't fall in the river,
I was thrown!

41:27.750 --> 41:30.667
-By your pimp, your john?
-What is it with you people?

41:30.836 --> 41:33.409
Every black woman has to have a pimp?

41:33.588 --> 41:36.126
You think there's work
on the pier for hookers?

41:36.299 --> 41:38.671
You think I'm giving blowjobs
to goldfish?

41:38.885 --> 41:42.219
-Is she on some kind of medication?
-Not that I know of.

41:42.388 --> 41:44.512
-Are you on medication?
-Marty!

41:44.724 --> 41:48.223
-You can talk directly to me, asshole.
-Watch your mouth.

41:48.436 --> 41:53.477
There is a dead man floating
around in the river.

41:53.690 --> 41:55.730
I think it's time to go home now.

41:55.901 --> 41:59.602
We sent a car down there, lady.
Look who I'm calling "lady."

41:59.821 --> 42:03.736
-We found nothing. Nothing, nothing!
-Well, drag the river!

42:04.410 --> 42:07.825
There are killers running
around the fucking city!

42:08.288 --> 42:11.573
How would you like me to wash
your mouth with a wire brush?

42:11.791 --> 42:14.364
How'd you like if I kick you
in the nuts so hard...

42:14.544 --> 42:17.248
...that they get lodged in your
fucking nostrils?

42:18.047 --> 42:23.042
My, that's a vivid image, isn't it?
Officer, look, here's my card.

42:23.219 --> 42:25.461
I'll be responsible for her,
I promise.

42:25.638 --> 42:29.220
-You better get her to a doctor.
-There's nothing wrong with me...

42:29.391 --> 42:32.262
-...dumb motherfucker!
-That's the word I don't like.

42:32.478 --> 42:35.727
-It's Tourette's syndrome!
-Book her for disturbing the peace.

42:35.939 --> 42:38.810
It's an illness.
People can't stop swearing.

42:38.984 --> 42:41.984
She has it bad.
Really, this is sweet talk for her.

42:42.153 --> 42:44.063
-Son of a bitch!
MARTY: Tourette's.

42:44.239 --> 42:47.156
-Look up Tourette's syndrome.
-You are a dumb fucker!

42:47.325 --> 42:51.239
<i>What, are you some kind of fucking
reject from Barney Miller?</i>

42:56.917 --> 43:00.121
I don't understand.
I don't get this.

43:00.296 --> 43:03.296
This is rose hips with zinc.
Drink this.

43:03.465 --> 43:06.669
How is it possible that a man
could be brutally murdered...

43:06.844 --> 43:08.717
...and it not appear in the paper?

43:08.887 --> 43:12.635
It wasn't in the paper on Saturday.
It wasn't in the paper on Sunday.

43:12.807 --> 43:16.472
-Not even in today's paper.
-Maybe you ought to forget about it.

43:16.644 --> 43:18.554
Bless you.

43:18.730 --> 43:23.059
Forget about it? You weren't there.
You didn't see that man float past me.

43:23.275 --> 43:25.268
-What's his name again?
-Van Meter.

43:25.444 --> 43:28.694
Look, Alexander's is having
a sale on toaster ovens.

43:31.575 --> 43:34.327
You weren't looking in the obituaries.

43:35.370 --> 43:39.664
Marty, you're a prince.

43:40.042 --> 43:44.869
MAN: It's the little things
that ease our life. And so are you.

43:45.047 --> 43:48.914
Mark Van Meter was a great success
in the greeting-card business.

43:49.092 --> 43:52.756
But he was a greater success
as a human being.

43:52.929 --> 43:55.716
His tragic death from a heart attack...

43:56.057 --> 43:59.342
...should remind us all
of how precious life is.

43:59.852 --> 44:02.639
Miss Doolittle. Hello.

44:03.397 --> 44:06.018
-Small world.
-Indeed.

44:06.192 --> 44:10.520
-You were a friend of Mr. Van Meter?
-Oh, yes, he saved my life.

44:12.740 --> 44:16.024
In Jesus Christ, our Lord, amen.

44:16.201 --> 44:17.825
-Look, we--
-Nice to see you.

44:18.036 --> 44:20.028
MAN 1: A lovely service.
MAN 2: Should we go?

44:20.204 --> 44:22.612
MAN 1: A wonderful man.
MAN 3: It's good you're here.

44:22.790 --> 44:27.417
-Excuse me. Are you Terry Doolittle?
-Who wants to know?

44:27.587 --> 44:30.374
I'm Liz Carlson.
You called my husband, Harry.

44:30.548 --> 44:34.379
Oh, yeah. Harry Carlson,
on the frying pan, yeah.

44:34.551 --> 44:40.221
You said you had a message from Jack,
but my husband's with Jack.

44:41.850 --> 44:44.685
Uh, let's talk.

44:45.270 --> 44:47.179
-Are you CIA?
-Who, me?

44:47.356 --> 44:51.223
No! No, no, I work in a bank.
I work on a computer.

44:51.401 --> 44:55.351
Suddenly I got involved in this,
and I'm not sure how to get out of it.

44:55.530 --> 44:57.154
Well, maybe I could help you.

44:57.323 --> 45:01.866
The last guy that tried to help me, you
know, Mr. Van Meter, he ended up dead.

45:02.036 --> 45:05.950
Excuse me, ladies.
Liz, Miss Doolittle.

45:06.707 --> 45:09.411
Am I wearing a nametag?
Who is this?

45:09.627 --> 45:10.872
That's Archer Lincoln.

45:11.962 --> 45:16.505
That's Archer Lincoln? He's on the back
of the frying pan too. See you later.

45:17.133 --> 45:18.675
Hey! Hey!

45:19.344 --> 45:22.677
You've gotta talk to me.
I've tried to call you for days.

45:22.848 --> 45:24.923
We'll have lunch any day you want!

45:25.099 --> 45:28.433
I got a message from a good friend!
You schmuck!

45:30.604 --> 45:32.265
Bye.

45:34.066 --> 45:36.604
TERRY: Would you please tell me
what is going on?

45:36.777 --> 45:40.609
Well, don't quote me, but obviously
somebody is trying to scare you...

45:40.781 --> 45:44.031
-...into giving them Jack's code key.
-Well....

45:44.201 --> 45:49.243
They're doing an awfully good job of it.
Come on, Liz, who is it?

45:49.414 --> 45:51.655
KGB probably.

45:51.833 --> 45:55.415
GIRL: You little brat!
Look what you did to my sweater!

45:55.586 --> 46:00.083
The KGB? The K-motherfucking-GB?

46:00.258 --> 46:01.633
-Stop.
-It looks great on you.

46:01.801 --> 46:03.081
Stop that right now!

46:03.260 --> 46:06.296
Harry Jr. ! Look at your face!
For heaven's sake!

46:06.472 --> 46:08.263
-Just put the icing on the cake...
-Liz.

46:08.432 --> 46:10.425
-Liz.
-...not on your sister's new sweater!

46:10.601 --> 46:15.892
-Liz! Liz! Liz! KGB!
-Not in front of the kids!

46:16.065 --> 46:20.276
-Can I write KGB on the cake?
-No, you may not.

46:21.820 --> 46:25.604
<i>JACK: Peter Caen?
-Unavailable.</i>

46:25.782 --> 46:30.574
<i>-Archer Lincoln?
-Him. Uncooperative.</i>

46:31.453 --> 46:34.704
<i>-Harry Carlson?
-Harry Carlson.</i>

46:34.874 --> 46:38.622
I thought he was with you.
That's what his wife said.

46:40.212 --> 46:44.624
<i>Was. Lost contact.
Thought he was homesick.</i>

46:48.595 --> 46:50.504
He never made it.

46:52.098 --> 46:54.672
<i>Have another favor to ask.</i>

46:56.436 --> 47:00.765
You have another favor to ask? Of
course, you wouldn't ask me was I hurt?

47:00.940 --> 47:04.024
Did they scare me?
Was the water shitty? No.

47:04.193 --> 47:07.776
<i>-You say, "Have another favor to ask."
-Never mind.</i>

47:07.947 --> 47:10.236
<i>Favor too dangerous.</i>

47:11.325 --> 47:14.077
Just like a man.

47:14.828 --> 47:19.122
<i>-What's the favor?
-Would you go back to the consulate?</i>

47:19.333 --> 47:22.950
Sure, no problem.
They let me in all the time.

47:23.127 --> 47:26.793
Whom would I talk to this time?

47:26.964 --> 47:30.381

-A pawn--
-Is the smallest piece in chess.

01:07:30.772 --> 01:07:34.472
And the most expendable.
The ones you sacrifice.

01:07:34.651 --> 01:07:37.402
Jack and I have been friends
for many, many years.

01:07:37.611 --> 01:07:40.648
And Jack knew it could
come to this going in.

01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:43.361
So let me give you
a little bit of advice.

01:07:43.534 --> 01:07:45.860
Amateur night, Miss Doolittle, is over.

01:07:46.704 --> 01:07:50.120
Get off the stage before
you get carried off.

01:07:55.754 --> 01:07:58.043
Archer Lincoln.

01:07:58.215 --> 01:08:00.919
I don't know about him.

01:08:01.927 --> 01:08:04.132
Eh. Good guy.

01:08:04.304 --> 01:08:06.095
MARTY: What are you doing?
-What?

01:08:06.264 --> 01:08:07.675
-What are you doing?
-Hi, Marty.

01:08:07.849 --> 01:08:10.849
-I'm just typing up my Christmas list.
-Am I on it?

01:08:11.019 --> 01:08:14.553
-Yeah, right. I got you on it.
-Don't tell me, don't tell me.

01:08:14.730 --> 01:08:18.894
Talbot. Repairman.

01:08:19.443 --> 01:08:21.602
Good guys.

01:08:21.779 --> 01:08:23.522
Me.

01:08:24.531 --> 01:08:27.402
Van Meter. Dead but good.

01:08:28.243 --> 01:08:29.987
Jack.

01:08:30.871 --> 01:08:34.286
Liz Carlson. Gone but good.

01:08:34.582 --> 01:08:38.877
How about--?
Fuck, what's her name?

01:08:39.045 --> 01:08:40.953
Sarah.

01:08:42.716 --> 01:08:45.004
Sarah, Sarah.

01:08:47.303 --> 01:08:49.296
Let's see.

01:09:12.702 --> 01:09:15.787
Miss Doolittle. What are you doing?

01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:17.956
Um....

01:09:18.122 --> 01:09:20.116
I have to make an important call.

01:09:20.334 --> 01:09:23.667
You know better than that.
You wait for your lunch hour.

01:09:23.837 --> 01:09:26.162
But it's important.
I gotta call my mother.

01:09:26.381 --> 01:09:29.417
She was standing on the corner
minding her business...

01:09:29.593 --> 01:09:33.636
-...and this tractor-trailer ran her over.
-Again?

01:09:33.805 --> 01:09:35.631
Your mother is having a bad month.

01:09:35.807 --> 01:09:38.761
Didn't she fall off a cross-town bus
last week?

01:09:39.143 --> 01:09:41.220
I'd like to be her beneficiary.

01:09:56.410 --> 01:09:59.114
-Get away from that phone!
-No, wait a minute!

01:09:59.287 --> 01:10:01.529
-Get out of here!
-No, I was here first!

01:10:01.706 --> 01:10:05.621
-I gotta reach out and touch someone.
-All right, forget it. Fine.

01:10:07.504 --> 01:10:09.377
MAN:
There she is.

01:10:13.551 --> 01:10:17.798
Yes, good afternoon.
May I speak with Lady Sarah, please?

01:10:18.348 --> 01:10:21.348
Oh, my name? Sybil Fawlty.

01:10:21.517 --> 01:10:25.846
Yes, I'm the social secretary
to Lady, Lady....

01:10:26.814 --> 01:10:30.681
Lady Andatramp. Yeah, that's right.
Lady Andatramp.

01:10:30.901 --> 01:10:33.522
You know, she's the Dutch dog fancier.

01:10:33.695 --> 01:10:35.155
Yes.

01:10:35.739 --> 01:10:39.653
Oh, yes. Could you hold on
one second?

01:10:39.826 --> 01:10:41.403
-What?
-You gonna be all day?

01:10:41.577 --> 01:10:46.535
Don't piss me off! Get the fuck
out of my face, okay? Dickhead!

01:10:46.707 --> 01:10:51.037
Look, can you tell me
where I might find Lady Sarah?

01:10:52.589 --> 01:10:54.996
Elizabeth Arden? All day?

01:11:00.846 --> 01:11:03.171
Go be a gentleman,
see where that gets you.

01:11:03.349 --> 01:11:04.973
TERRY:
I mean, that's our jobs.

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:11.556
Yes. Thank you so much.
God save the queen.

01:11:11.731 --> 01:11:16.477
<i>Bon vivant. Arrivederci. That kind
of thing. Yes, bye-bye. Bye.</i>

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.739
What?

01:11:21.365 --> 01:11:23.572
You want a quarter?
Kiss my ass!

01:11:23.742 --> 01:11:26.577
Find me in New York
for this fucking quarter.

01:11:30.917 --> 01:11:34.616
Okay, okay, okay.
I was just-- Here's your quarter.

01:11:34.795 --> 01:11:37.796
I'm sorry. Who knew there was
a phone gestapo? I mean--

01:11:41.217 --> 01:11:44.219
MAN: Could you get my umbrella
while you're at it there?

01:11:46.264 --> 01:11:48.091
TERRY:
These guys are serious.

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:55.594
Hey, my umbrella!

01:11:55.814 --> 01:11:57.938
TERRY:
Oh, shit!

01:12:00.611 --> 01:12:04.146
Hey, hey, hey! Stop, stop, stop!
Call the police!

01:12:04.323 --> 01:12:08.818
You can't miss me! I'm a little black
woman in a big silver box...

01:12:08.993 --> 01:12:13.952
...and the top of the thing
says "phone." Help!

01:12:14.165 --> 01:12:18.245
Oh, Jesus! Hey!
Watch out for the car!

01:12:18.462 --> 01:12:23.206
Help! I'm stuck in a phone booth! Help!

01:12:23.591 --> 01:12:27.540
You, brother! Yo, brother man! Black
power! Get me the fuck out of here!

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:28.834
Right on!

01:12:29.013 --> 01:12:30.840
TERRY:
Don't wave at me! Call the police!

01:12:31.015 --> 01:12:34.349
Help me! Call the police!

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:38.094
Oh, fuck! Help! Help!

01:12:38.314 --> 01:12:41.480
-We're gonna clean your window.
-Don't wash the windows.

01:12:41.650 --> 01:12:44.650
-Don't wa-- Get me out!
-Come on, give us some money!

01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:48.686
Only in New York could you be in a
phone booth, and nobody does anything.

01:12:48.949 --> 01:12:55.698
Help! I'm moving towards
the uptown area. Help me now!

01:12:58.791 --> 01:13:01.080
Oh, fuck!

01:13:03.463 --> 01:13:05.750
Stop!

01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:16.465
I'll get-- I'll get back to you.

01:13:26.526 --> 01:13:30.226
-Oh, you found me!
MAN: Lady, you okay?

01:13:31.614 --> 01:13:35.528
TERRY: Hey, get the SWAT guys!
Your ass is mine now!

01:13:35.743 --> 01:13:36.774
Asshole!

01:13:37.327 --> 01:13:38.703
Whoa.

01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:42.571
-I owe you one.
-Oh, no! No, you're gonna kill me!

01:13:42.749 --> 01:13:45.205
-I'm dying!
-No, you're not gonna die.

01:13:45.418 --> 01:13:48.040
-Not yet. Not till you tell me the truth.
-What?

01:13:48.254 --> 01:13:51.374
-Let the serum take effect, Terry.
-Truth serum?

01:13:51.550 --> 01:13:54.503
-What kind of hokey shit is that?
-Tell me the truth.

01:13:54.677 --> 01:13:57.797
-Tell me the truth.
-I'm not gonna tell you anything!

01:13:58.014 --> 01:14:02.307
-Come on. Where is Jack? Come on.
-You know, my ears are ringing.

01:14:02.518 --> 01:14:05.056
-Only the truth, Terry.
-It is the truth.

01:14:05.229 --> 01:14:08.479
I don't know anything.
I don't know anything about anything.

01:14:08.649 --> 01:14:12.729
-I don't know anything about Jack Fla-
-Where is he, Terry?

01:14:14.363 --> 01:14:16.521
-I.... You know, I--
-Fuck the insurance!

01:14:16.698 --> 01:14:19.071
-Is my face melting?
-The key!

01:14:19.242 --> 01:14:23.370
The key, Terry! I need the key!
Jack's code key. What's the key?

01:14:23.538 --> 01:14:25.115
-The key?
-Yes.

01:14:25.289 --> 01:14:28.540
-The key!
-The key is the key.

01:14:28.710 --> 01:14:30.999
-What does that mean?
-The key is the key.

01:14:31.170 --> 01:14:35.915
I gave her too much. Goddamn it!
Get in the car! Damn it!

01:14:36.092 --> 01:14:39.295
I'll meet you back in the basement.
She's got too much.

01:14:39.511 --> 01:14:42.845
The basement? You're not taking
anybody to the basement.

01:14:43.015 --> 01:14:46.016
-Hello, police? I'm being taken--
-Hey, stop that!

01:14:46.184 --> 01:14:49.849
-Do you read me? Stop, stop, stop!
-What do you think you're doing?

01:14:50.021 --> 01:14:53.770
Hey! Put that down!
Turn that off! Hey! Give me that!

01:14:53.942 --> 01:14:57.393
You bitch! Hey, you stupid bitch!
Let go of my arm!

01:14:57.570 --> 01:15:01.189
Unlock the door!
What? Give me that!

01:15:02.116 --> 01:15:06.114
Oh, shit! Carl! Carl!

01:15:06.286 --> 01:15:09.905
Oh, my God!
Turn right! Oh, my God!

01:15:13.836 --> 01:15:17.999
And you deserve it, asshole!
And that's the truth!

01:15:21.385 --> 01:15:24.718
Oh, my God. You ever wonder
what the fuck Martinizing is?

01:15:24.887 --> 01:15:26.085
-Yeah.
-I do.

01:15:26.265 --> 01:15:28.470
I wonder about that stuff all the time.

01:15:28.641 --> 01:15:31.845
Oh, look! A tropical fish
and his mate!

01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:35.435
-I love it.
MAN: See, I told you you look good.

01:15:35.607 --> 01:15:37.314
Oh, boy.

01:15:38.443 --> 01:15:41.230
Boy, they got funky-looking
people in New York.

01:15:42.029 --> 01:15:46.774
I have to go to Elizabeth Arden.
I gotta save my friend Jack.

01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:49.323
You know, he's a spy.

01:15:52.289 --> 01:15:55.622
How do you know that's what
happens when you put Ex-Lax in tea?

01:15:55.792 --> 01:15:58.912
DRIVER: I thought I heard everything.
Thanks, lady.

01:15:59.087 --> 01:16:03.998
TERRY: Who the fuck is Elizabeth Arden?
I don't know. Hey, baby, open the door.

01:16:04.175 --> 01:16:07.793
-Good afternoon, madam.
-Taxi!

01:16:13.935 --> 01:16:18.146
Jesus! Jesus! I--

01:16:18.314 --> 01:16:21.897
-I have to see Lady Sarah Billings.
-She's having her treatment.

01:16:22.067 --> 01:16:25.601
-May I take a message? Security, please.
TERRY: Jesus!

01:16:25.821 --> 01:16:29.154
-No wonder they call it toilet water.
-You can't go in there.

01:16:29.365 --> 01:16:31.773
-What's your name?
-Earl.

01:16:31.951 --> 01:16:34.240
You look like a smart guy, Earl.

01:16:34.412 --> 01:16:39.370
See this face? This is the face
of a woman on the edge, Earl.

01:16:39.584 --> 01:16:43.249
-I know. My wife's got the same face.
-You have to make a decision.

01:16:43.462 --> 01:16:47.507
Do you wanna work here,
or do you want to live?

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:53.216
I quit, I quit.

01:16:53.388 --> 01:16:54.763
TERRY:
Sarah!

01:16:54.932 --> 01:16:57.007
RECEPTIONIST:
Does anyone have a pocket pistol?

01:16:57.183 --> 01:17:01.015
God, it's hot in here! I can't believe this.
What are you people doing?

01:17:01.229 --> 01:17:03.980
You don't have to spend your money!
Spend my money!

01:17:04.191 --> 01:17:06.728
You want some money?
Beauty comes from within!

01:17:06.943 --> 01:17:08.852
It's not something you can buy!

01:17:09.904 --> 01:17:14.067
Except for you. You need the most help.
Use my MasterCard.

01:17:14.283 --> 01:17:15.314
Sarah!

01:17:15.493 --> 01:17:17.569
RECEPTIONIST:
She doesn't know what she means.

01:17:17.745 --> 01:17:19.903
Look at this woman!
She looks terrible!

01:17:20.081 --> 01:17:21.623
RECEPTIONIST:
It's a man.

01:17:22.666 --> 01:17:25.371
WOMAN:
Well, I never!

01:17:25.544 --> 01:17:27.501
TERRY:
Sorry. Sarah! Sarah!

01:17:27.712 --> 01:17:28.993
-No!
-Sarah!

01:17:29.172 --> 01:17:31.497
-No! Miss!
-Sarah!

01:17:32.009 --> 01:17:33.122
Miss! Miss!

01:17:33.302 --> 01:17:35.971
<i>What the fuck are you running here,
Wild Kingdom?</i>

01:17:36.138 --> 01:17:39.340
Loveliness is a woman's obligation
and reward.

01:17:39.515 --> 01:17:40.547
Her biggest--

01:17:42.143 --> 01:17:45.060
Hi. Remember me?

01:17:45.605 --> 01:17:50.978
Embassy ball? Liz Carlson's cousin
Terry Doolittle. Hi.

01:17:52.236 --> 01:17:54.443
-Good to see you.
-How are you?

01:17:54.655 --> 01:17:58.487
Oh, boy, well. You know,
I hate my job. I hate this city.

01:17:58.701 --> 01:18:03.362
I'm a little bit lonely periodically.
I feel like I got my period every day.

01:18:03.538 --> 01:18:06.409
For the most part, the spy stuff is--
Big mistake.

01:18:06.625 --> 01:18:11.750
-Other than that, I'm great.
-Karen, just give us five minutes, please.

01:18:13.256 --> 01:18:16.957
Don't take too long.
You'll lose that tonality.

01:18:17.468 --> 01:18:20.718
We don't want your cheeks
dropping to your knees.

01:18:21.055 --> 01:18:24.258
-Where is he?
-Russia, I think. I'm not sure.

01:18:24.433 --> 01:18:27.006
People are chasing him.
He needs to get out.

01:18:27.185 --> 01:18:31.017
I thought we could go to your husband
and get an exit contact for him.

01:18:32.232 --> 01:18:35.351
-Why on earth would we do that?
-He's your friend.

01:18:35.527 --> 01:18:38.444
That's what you do for friends
is you help them out.

01:18:38.655 --> 01:18:42.522
-You're assuming a great deal.
-Come on, Sarah.

01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:46.319
I mean, you don't want me to beg
on my knees, do you? I mean....

01:18:46.496 --> 01:18:50.576
You guys had a thing once.
You were close. I mean, come on.

01:18:50.791 --> 01:18:54.207
Jack was a very long time ago.
I can't help you.

01:18:54.378 --> 01:18:56.786
-Oh, you can't?
-I'm sorry, Miss Doolittle.

01:18:56.964 --> 01:18:59.039
There's absolutely nothing I can do.

01:18:59.257 --> 01:19:03.386
You're just gonna lay back in your
pink room, in your pink towel...

01:19:03.554 --> 01:19:08.131
...with your little pink face and your
pink blanket and your big, pink feet.

01:19:08.349 --> 01:19:13.058
And you're gonna lay there and tell me
you're sorry? You're more than sorry.

01:19:13.229 --> 01:19:19.517
You know? You know what you are?
You're-- You're sad.

01:19:31.247 --> 01:19:36.407
LARRY: Hey, Terry, you are late.
Page is pissed, man. He is smoking.

01:19:36.585 --> 01:19:39.420
Larry, you gotta stop smoking
them cigars, man.

01:19:39.588 --> 01:19:43.799
-And for God's sake, lose some weight.
-I lost five pounds last week.

01:19:44.008 --> 01:19:47.591
I even cut back on hog maws
and chitterlings.

01:19:49.931 --> 01:19:52.256
-Hi.
-Hey, you're late! You're late.

01:19:53.726 --> 01:19:56.300
-I'm gonna slide on down--
DOUG: Is she drunk?

01:19:56.479 --> 01:19:58.851
CYNTHIA: What's she doing?
TERRY: Okay.

01:19:59.023 --> 01:20:00.517
-She cracks me up.
DOUG: Terry.

01:20:00.733 --> 01:20:03.271
Come on, get up.
Mr. Page is going to see you.

01:20:03.443 --> 01:20:05.352
-I'm okay.
-Where have you been?

01:20:05.529 --> 01:20:06.774
I went and had--

01:20:06.947 --> 01:20:09.271
Stop wearing this lipstick.
Do me a favor.

01:20:09.450 --> 01:20:11.358
-Okay.
-It looks so strange on your lips.

01:20:11.534 --> 01:20:16.873
-Get her some water. She's drunk.
-Marry her. The babies need a last name.

01:20:17.039 --> 01:20:18.700
-Did you tell her?
-No.

01:20:18.917 --> 01:20:21.953
Terry, what's wrong with you?
You look awful.

01:20:22.169 --> 01:20:24.209
-Your ulcer.
TERRY: Is Page looking for me?

01:20:24.422 --> 01:20:26.497
Every five minutes. Be cool.

01:20:26.716 --> 01:20:32.919
Congratulations. You've finally shattered
the Guinness record for tardiness.

01:20:33.138 --> 01:20:35.261
I'm taking you upstairs.

01:20:35.850 --> 01:20:38.601
I'm not gonna say anything.

01:20:40.479 --> 01:20:44.690
Maybe one or two things. Come here.
All six of you, come here.

01:20:44.899 --> 01:20:50.984
Look, I've just had several of the worst
days of my young life, Mr. Page.

01:20:51.155 --> 01:20:53.990
And, well, the last thing I need...

01:20:54.409 --> 01:20:59.485
...is some jiggerhead like you
to be screaming at me in a whiny voice.

01:20:59.706 --> 01:21:03.999
If you don't leave me alone, I'm gonna
snatch this bad boy off your head.

01:21:04.209 --> 01:21:05.869
I'll have to ram this...

01:21:06.044 --> 01:21:08.286
...straight up your chocolate whiz way.

01:21:08.463 --> 01:21:11.833
LISA: Oh, my God.
-Get Larry, the heavyset guard.

01:21:12.509 --> 01:21:14.715
MARTY: Call an ambulance!
-Hey, that's my hat.

01:21:14.928 --> 01:21:18.511
Help me with her.
Just put that down.

01:21:18.723 --> 01:21:20.715
I had no idea he was bald.

01:21:20.892 --> 01:21:23.098
MARTY: What did you think that was?
-Hair.

01:21:23.477 --> 01:21:25.802
-Mr. Page, can we use your office?
MR. PAGE: No.

01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:30.024
-Come on. It's office decorum.
MR. PAGE: Well, put her in my office.

01:22:02.015 --> 01:22:06.012
-Hi, Sarah.
-Oh.

01:22:06.185 --> 01:22:07.644
Come in.

01:22:09.104 --> 01:22:14.774
-I'm sorry to bother you.
-I was just cleaning up my apartment.

01:22:14.943 --> 01:22:17.612
I was afraid to call,
and this couldn't wait.

01:22:17.821 --> 01:22:20.526
Do you remember what you said
to me at the salon?

01:22:20.699 --> 01:22:24.483
-Not a goddamn word of it.
-You were very eloquent.

01:22:25.203 --> 01:22:28.037
Really? Thanks.

01:22:28.205 --> 01:22:30.577
So I persuaded my husband
to get involved.

01:22:30.749 --> 01:22:33.454
He, in turn, spoke with Ml-5 in London.

01:22:36.213 --> 01:22:37.292
This is for Jack?

01:22:37.506 --> 01:22:40.341
In the envelope, you'll find
the name of a person...

01:22:40.509 --> 01:22:45.087
...and a rendezvous point. If Jack makes
this contact, he'll be home in 72 hours.

01:22:49.059 --> 01:22:53.222
Hey. You're a real lady, Sarah.

01:23:06.241 --> 01:23:11.200
Jack, you got good taste.
Pack your bags, bud.

01:23:11.371 --> 01:23:16.875
I got good news for you. I got your
exit contact from your old flame.

01:23:17.043 --> 01:23:19.451
<i>JACK: Who?
-I knew you'd want to know.</i>

01:23:19.629 --> 01:23:21.456
Sinai Sarah.

01:23:24.551 --> 01:23:27.421
<i>Maybe we should leave
this game to the women.</i>

01:23:27.637 --> 01:23:30.804
Yes. Or maybe if you left
it to the women...

01:23:30.974 --> 01:23:34.057
...we wouldn't be playing
these stupid games.

01:23:35.854 --> 01:23:41.607
Okay. "Contact Burg will meet
you tomorrow." Okay.

01:23:41.817 --> 01:23:47.689
Contact Burghardt. Will meet you
at Rezo Inn 5 p.m. tomorrow.

01:23:48.865 --> 01:23:50.360
<i>Thanks.</i>

01:23:51.034 --> 01:23:57.487
Smooth talker. Take care of yourself.
Keep your terminal open tomorrow.

01:23:57.665 --> 01:24:01.912
<i>I owe you my life. I don't know
how I can ever repay you.</i>

01:24:04.088 --> 01:24:08.833
I think I'll settle for veal dinner.

01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:11.215
<i>You're on. How about Orlando's?</i>

01:24:12.054 --> 01:24:16.847
Not bad taste. Orlando's. Sure.
Anything else?

01:24:17.976 --> 01:24:19.256
<i>Sweet dreams.</i>

01:24:24.983 --> 01:24:26.810
You too, Jack.

01:24:28.569 --> 01:24:30.562
You too, man.

01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:53.376
Oh, shit.

01:24:53.551 --> 01:24:58.214
MAN:
Mm, mm, mm, mm!

01:24:58.390 --> 01:25:01.973
Baby, look what we have here.

01:25:03.311 --> 01:25:06.347
-Take your hands off me.
-What's wrong with you?

01:25:06.522 --> 01:25:08.729
-Who taught you how to dress?
-I did.

01:25:08.941 --> 01:25:10.768
-Rattle my chains.
-Fucking mother!

01:25:10.943 --> 01:25:14.359
-Hey, baby, don't worry. I'll go first.
-You don't want me.

01:25:14.530 --> 01:25:17.447
You don't want me. I got diseases.

01:25:17.657 --> 01:25:22.864
-I got shit that'll make your dick fall off.
MAN: Baby, my dick glows in the dark.

01:25:23.622 --> 01:25:26.409
She don't deserve us.
She was your chick.

01:25:26.624 --> 01:25:28.582
I'm cured! I'm cured!

01:25:28.752 --> 01:25:34.338
I'm gonna party with you guys.
We'll have a great time!

01:25:34.507 --> 01:25:36.001
And we'll have sex!

01:25:36.218 --> 01:25:38.922
-We'll do lots of drugs!
-Yeah.

01:25:39.095 --> 01:25:43.389
We'll have a real good time,
and then we'll get down and boogie.

01:25:43.599 --> 01:25:46.469
-I think I got a business appointment.
-I gotta go!

01:25:46.685 --> 01:25:52.521
What's the matter? I said, I was cured.
Where are you going? I'm cured.

01:26:06.370 --> 01:26:08.198
TALBOT:
Good afternoon.

01:26:10.709 --> 01:26:12.084
Ah!

01:26:14.295 --> 01:26:16.122
TERRY: What?
-Good afternoon.

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:20.795
-What do you mean, afternoon?
-It's a little after 3.

01:26:23.512 --> 01:26:29.881
You're too late. I already sent
Jack his exit contact.

01:26:30.101 --> 01:26:32.770
-Yes, I know.
-What do you mean?

01:26:32.937 --> 01:26:36.022
TALBOT: Who do you think gave
the exit contact to Lord Malcolm?

01:26:36.191 --> 01:26:40.188
Where did you think he'd come?
We're his trusted staff.

01:26:42.447 --> 01:26:45.068
You bastards!

01:26:51.706 --> 01:26:54.112
Don't underestimate your role.

01:26:54.292 --> 01:26:58.668
You led us right to Jack.
You sprang the trap.

01:27:00.797 --> 01:27:03.549
No. Jack was hip to you.

01:27:03.717 --> 01:27:07.715
And Jack knew you were playing
both sides of the fence.

01:27:07.887 --> 01:27:11.671
-And that's why you're so pissed off.
-Please, Miss Doolittle.

01:27:11.850 --> 01:27:15.300
In a very short while, he'll be dead.
Know why?

01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:18.805
Because he's going to contact
Burghardt. At the Rezo lnn.

01:27:18.981 --> 01:27:21.472
5 p.m. Ring a bell?

01:27:21.942 --> 01:27:24.018
-No.
-What do you mean, no?

01:27:24.820 --> 01:27:29.363
-I mean, that's not the message I sent.
-What was the message you sent?

01:27:31.117 --> 01:27:33.869
Wouldn't you like to know.

01:27:34.079 --> 01:27:39.286
Lord Malcolm might not be that swift,
but he seems to be onto you chumps.

01:27:39.501 --> 01:27:42.501
-She's bluffing.
-We'll soon find out.

01:27:42.712 --> 01:27:45.499
You're gonna tell us
what we want to know.

01:27:45.673 --> 01:27:47.381
Who are you?
The Pillsbury Doughboy?

01:27:47.592 --> 01:27:50.794
Ooh! Just kidding.

01:27:50.969 --> 01:27:54.006
I congratulate you on your analysis
of my situation.

01:27:54.181 --> 01:27:58.641
Jack has uncovered information linking
an official to an unfriendly government.

01:27:58.810 --> 01:28:05.145
-By now, he accurately suspects me.
-You're a KGB whoozi-whatsits.

01:28:05.316 --> 01:28:06.692
A mole!

01:28:06.901 --> 01:28:12.572
-Very good! You're a clever girl.
-What contact did you send?

01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:17.951
Carl, please persuade her.

01:28:27.629 --> 01:28:29.622
What contact did you send?

01:28:29.799 --> 01:28:33.630
Since I didn't know where Jack was,
I had to discredit his information.

01:28:33.802 --> 01:28:37.253
I put out the word that he killed
Carlson and then defected.

01:28:38.181 --> 01:28:40.968
That closed most doors.

01:28:42.185 --> 01:28:45.055
That's why he wound up with you.

01:28:47.148 --> 01:28:49.853
-We don't have much time.
-Enough rehearsal.

01:28:51.277 --> 01:28:53.982
This is for what you did
to our friend Zarkoff.

01:28:54.196 --> 01:28:55.987
Don't do it!

01:29:05.791 --> 01:29:07.201
TALBOT:
Come on! Come on!

01:29:11.212 --> 01:29:14.878
TALBOT:
Watch out! Get up! Get up! Hurry!

01:29:16.092 --> 01:29:17.123
Don't kill her.

01:29:17.344 --> 01:29:20.510
-No, don't kill me. You're right.
-She's worthless dead.

01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:23.384
-I gotta be sure.
-Be sure, Mr. Talbot.

01:29:23.599 --> 01:29:25.307
-Shoot her in the legs.
TERRY: No!

01:29:25.518 --> 01:29:30.476
Are you crazy? If you shoot me
in the legs, I'll blow my brains out.

01:29:31.648 --> 01:29:35.480
TALBOT: It's just another bluff.
-No, it isn't! Look! See? See? Look.

01:29:35.693 --> 01:29:39.822
I'm gonna kill myself.
Finger on the trigger. Stay right there.

01:29:40.032 --> 01:29:42.570
She can't leave the consulate.
Take the stairs.

01:29:42.784 --> 01:29:45.240
Ah! There's a lady with a gun!

01:29:45.870 --> 01:29:48.824
MAN: What has she got in her hand?
-She's got a weapon!

01:29:52.085 --> 01:29:55.002
TERRY: Call the police.
-My God, you're a terrorist.

01:29:55.171 --> 01:29:58.207
TERRY: Call the police.
GILLIAN: Do you have a list of demands?

01:29:58.424 --> 01:30:03.085
I demand you call the fucking police.
I demand you call the fucking police!

01:30:03.261 --> 01:30:05.717
Want a hostage?
I've been trained to be one.

01:30:05.931 --> 01:30:10.308
Please. I have a gun in your face.
I'm threatening myself.

01:30:11.144 --> 01:30:13.220
All right, freeze! Drop it!

01:30:13.646 --> 01:30:17.430
Okay! God.

01:30:18.401 --> 01:30:20.857
It's down.

01:30:22.113 --> 01:30:24.271
It took you guys
long enough to get here.

01:30:24.448 --> 01:30:26.109
COP:
Let's go. Read her her rights.

01:30:26.284 --> 01:30:29.782
-Come peacefully, you won't get hurt.
-I'm glad to see you guys.

01:30:29.996 --> 01:30:33.613
Those guys tried to put my lights out.
I gotta get downtown fast.

01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:35.949
COP: Don't worry, you will.
-Hey!

01:30:36.669 --> 01:30:38.328
Get in.

01:30:46.344 --> 01:30:50.424
Did you see the look on that schmuck's
face? Jeez, this is great!

01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:53.640
-Shut the fuck up.
-Hey, don't talk to me like that.

01:30:53.852 --> 01:30:56.176
Could you drop me off downtown?

01:30:56.353 --> 01:31:00.018
-I have important business to deal with.
-You are nuts.

01:31:00.232 --> 01:31:04.276
You still don't get it? Look, there's a guy
in Russia who's gonna die...

01:31:04.487 --> 01:31:07.653
...unless I get back to my computer
terminal in 45 minutes.

01:31:07.823 --> 01:31:11.903
It'll take that long to book you.
You'll be lucky to get there in 45 days!

01:31:12.118 --> 01:31:16.448
-Book me? Book me? Bullshit!
-Hey, sit down!

01:31:19.417 --> 01:31:24.412
COP: Hey, Charlie. Charlie, you all right?
All right, call it in! I'm going after her.

01:31:41.313 --> 01:31:43.886
Coming through! Get out of the way!
Look out!

01:31:44.066 --> 01:31:46.105
LARRY: Slow down.
You're gonna hurt yourself.

01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:49.780
-Get out of the way, Lisa!
DOUG: Marty called.

01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:54.526
Maybe she got herself a boyfriend.
Terry, what's going on?

01:31:54.743 --> 01:31:59.321
-Jack. B-Flat.
-See, what did I tell you? Jack.

01:31:59.538 --> 01:32:03.583
Jack, do you receive? Jack?

01:32:03.792 --> 01:32:06.081
<i>JACK: Jack here. Just leaving.
Anything wrong?</i>

01:32:06.295 --> 01:32:09.960
Listen carefully. Can--?

01:32:10.173 --> 01:32:15.594
Jack? What is this? Every time,
I get this Russian bitch on my terminal!

01:32:15.805 --> 01:32:18.556
-Fucking machine!
-It's unbelievable. You're fired.

01:32:18.724 --> 01:32:22.139
I'm conferring with members
of the British financial community.

01:32:22.351 --> 01:32:26.052
-And they hear this language.
TALBOT: It's all right. We're used to it.

01:32:26.272 --> 01:32:27.434
Well, I'm sorry, I....

01:32:27.606 --> 01:32:30.359
It appears you did send
the Burghardt contact.

01:32:30.568 --> 01:32:34.232
MR. PAGE: I couldn't find the Burghardt
information on any of these terminals.

01:32:34.447 --> 01:32:37.483
<i>TERRY: Bastard.
JACK: Terry, what's wrong?</i>

01:32:37.658 --> 01:32:41.442
-Tell him nothing's wrong.
-Who are these people? I want to know--

01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:43.280
-Step out, Mr. Page.
-Tell him.

01:32:43.455 --> 01:32:46.206
MR. PAGE: Get Larry, the guard.
-Take your hands off me.

01:32:46.375 --> 01:32:49.826
LARRY:
Can't help you now, Mr. Page.

01:32:55.759 --> 01:32:58.297
<i>JACK:
Terry, what's wrong?</i>

01:33:08.645 --> 01:33:10.934
On second thought, Mr. Talbot...

01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:15.808
...send it your goddamn self.

01:33:18.947 --> 01:33:21.189
-Oh, you shouldn't--
-Shut up!

01:33:22.659 --> 01:33:25.494
Don't let her send! Hunter, stop her!

01:33:25.703 --> 01:33:28.490
Don't let her send a message!
Keep her away from--

01:33:31.418 --> 01:33:33.326
My hat! My hat!

01:33:38.049 --> 01:33:40.088
TALBOT:
Don't kill anyone!

01:33:41.093 --> 01:33:44.545
-Oh, my God!
TALBOT: Don't shoot the machines!

01:33:52.896 --> 01:33:55.648
<i>JACK: Terry, must leave
in order to make contact.</i>

01:33:55.857 --> 01:33:57.648
MR. PAGE:
Get off my foot!

01:33:58.651 --> 01:34:03.397
TERRY: Burghardt is setup. Will kill you.
HUNTER: Oh, no, you don't!

01:34:03.573 --> 01:34:06.941
-Kill her?
TALBOT: Feel free!

01:34:07.577 --> 01:34:08.952
Carl!

01:34:12.832 --> 01:34:14.373
Why do I have to work here?

01:34:27.554 --> 01:34:29.594
Cancel that message.

01:34:36.396 --> 01:34:40.263
Cancel the message.
Cancel the message.

01:34:40.483 --> 01:34:43.436
I'll cancel something even better.

01:34:59.542 --> 01:35:03.374
I don't believe her.

01:35:04.839 --> 01:35:06.547
-What's his code?
-Who are you?

01:35:06.758 --> 01:35:10.969
CIA. What's his code?
What's his code?

01:35:11.137 --> 01:35:14.837
-Give me his code, goddamn it!
-All right. It's B-Flat. God.

01:35:15.057 --> 01:35:17.299
DOUG: Take a picture of me
next to the dead guy.

01:35:17.476 --> 01:35:19.433
<i>JACK:
Still here, sweetheart.</i>

01:35:19.603 --> 01:35:24.941
MARTY: Glad to hear it, honey.
It's Peter Caen.

01:35:26.443 --> 01:35:29.527
-You're Peter Caen?
-Yeah. I'll explain it all later.

01:35:29.696 --> 01:35:32.104
-The one on the frying pan?
-Yes.

01:35:33.783 --> 01:35:36.155
Have Talbot. Have exit contact.

01:35:36.369 --> 01:35:42.490
Meet Matuchek, store on Balton Street.
Will get you home. Promise.

01:35:42.708 --> 01:35:46.623
-Anything you want to say?
-Well, tell him not to forget our date.

01:35:46.837 --> 01:35:49.293
All this is for a date?

01:36:26.542 --> 01:36:28.700
WAITER:
Our specials tonight--

01:36:28.919 --> 01:36:32.417
-Welcome back.
-Well, thank you. Excuse me.

01:36:33.256 --> 01:36:35.498
Darling, I'm sorry.

01:37:01.659 --> 01:37:06.569
WAITER: More bread sticks, madame?
-Oh, no. Could I have the check, please?

01:37:23.554 --> 01:37:25.213
Hi.

01:37:27.808 --> 01:37:30.892
Hi, Marty. I'm sorry, Peter.

01:37:31.103 --> 01:37:33.676
-It's all right.
-What are you doing here?

01:37:34.147 --> 01:37:37.765
-You look very nice.
-Yeah? Thanks.

01:37:37.943 --> 01:37:40.943
-What are you doing here?
-Jack isn't coming.

01:37:42.155 --> 01:37:44.480
I'm sorry. He sent me a telex
from London.

01:37:44.657 --> 01:37:48.868
Told me to come and explain it to you.
I know that he wanted to be here.

01:37:49.036 --> 01:37:50.780
It's no big deal, you know.

01:37:50.955 --> 01:37:54.158
After all, I was just some words
on a screen, right?

01:37:54.333 --> 01:37:58.496
A screwdriver, a mechanic's tool
to be used by you guys.

01:37:59.754 --> 01:38:03.455
-He asked me to take care of this.
-Please. No.

01:38:04.843 --> 01:38:09.173
It's too much like him leaving my room
and leaving money on the dresser.

01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:15.719
-Forty dollars. Great.
-Terry.

01:38:15.896 --> 01:38:19.595
Well, I did my part for democracy.

01:38:31.911 --> 01:38:34.283
I'll take you home, okay?

01:38:34.621 --> 01:38:38.489
No. No. I'm okay.

01:38:38.667 --> 01:38:40.659
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:38:46.258 --> 01:38:50.421
She should be happy. Page is leaving,
and she's taking over his job.

01:38:50.595 --> 01:38:54.260
If I'd known that'd get a promotion,
I'd have blown up the place.

01:38:54.432 --> 01:38:58.761
Terry, I've got a great idea.
Let's have a little fun tonight after work.

01:38:58.936 --> 01:39:02.885
-Yeah, quit moping. Come with us.
-Yeah, we could go to Cole's.

01:39:03.816 --> 01:39:08.027
-No, thanks, you guys.
-Come on.

01:39:15.660 --> 01:39:17.569
<i>JACK:
Knock, knock.</i>

01:39:25.377 --> 01:39:27.335
<i>Knock, knock. Please.</i>

01:39:29.298 --> 01:39:31.005
Leave me alone.

01:39:31.175 --> 01:39:35.303
<i>I'm sorry. Unavoidably delayed
in London. Queen thanks you.</i>

01:39:35.512 --> 01:39:38.632
Frankly, I don't give
a shit about the queen.

01:39:38.807 --> 01:39:41.262
I did give a shit about you, however.

01:39:41.434 --> 01:39:45.812
I sat in that restaurant
feeling stupid and hurt.

01:39:45.981 --> 01:39:47.854
I mean, what happened to you?

01:39:48.024 --> 01:39:53.018
All you had to do was come
and say "hi" or "thanks" or something.

01:39:53.195 --> 01:39:56.399
I mean, you just left me sitting there.

01:39:56.616 --> 01:40:01.526
But no, you sent me to a restaurant
with shitty bread sticks.

01:40:01.704 --> 01:40:03.945
<i>Sorry. I still want to take
you to dinner.</i>

01:40:04.748 --> 01:40:10.252
Next time I'm in London,
I'll look you up.

01:40:12.464 --> 01:40:15.832
<i>-Careful, you'll break your glasses.
-Thank you.</i>

01:40:25.685 --> 01:40:29.469
<i>-Where are you?
-Two rows back, on the left.</i>

01:40:36.112 --> 01:40:37.487
Oh.

01:40:41.617 --> 01:40:44.902
JACK:
Aren't you gonna turn around?

01:40:46.162 --> 01:40:47.621
No.

01:40:49.333 --> 01:40:53.115
JACK:
Why not?

01:40:55.881 --> 01:40:59.296
Well, because it....

01:41:06.682 --> 01:41:08.425
Hi, Jack.

01:41:16.483 --> 01:41:20.527
-I don't know how to thank you.
-Don't worry. I have a list.

01:41:27.786 --> 01:41:32.660
-What did you say about the queen?
-Forget I said it.

01:41:32.874 --> 01:41:35.115
-She'll be pleased to hear that.
-I bet.

01:41:35.292 --> 01:41:39.372
-How about that dinner?
-I'm not dressed for dinner.

01:41:39.589 --> 01:41:40.619
You look great.

01:41:40.798 --> 01:41:44.664
Not as great as I looked the last time
I got dressed to meet you.

01:41:44.844 --> 01:41:48.425
I looked fantastic!
Then all these crazy people--

01:41:48.596 --> 01:41:52.297
-Miss Doolittle? Never mind.
CYNTHIA: Terry?

01:41:52.517 --> 01:41:53.797
Is that him?

01:41:54.561 --> 01:41:56.304
This is Jack.

01:41:56.479 --> 01:41:59.017
CYNTHIA:
Hi, Jack!

01:41:59.231 --> 01:42:02.186
Ah!
Wh--?

01:42:02.652 --> 01:42:04.478
Go Terry! Yahoo!

01:42:07.197 --> 01:42:08.395
Terry!

01:42:13.578 --> 01:42:15.370
FRED:
Way to go, Terry!

01:42:15.664 --> 01:42:18.333
LARRY: You're looking lovely.
You're looking spiffy.

01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:20.576
You're looking good, mama!
