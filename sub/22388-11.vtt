ANNOUNCER: (ON SPEAKER)
<i>From the Penn &amp; Teller Theater</i>

00:23.867 --> 00:28.533
<i>in Las Vegas, Nevada,</i>
<i>here's our host, Jonathan Ross.</i>

00:28.600 --> 00:29.900
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

00:30.100 --> 00:31.800
Thank you very much.

00:31.867 --> 00:33.100
Thank you very much indeed.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.200
How lovely.
Thank you so much.

00:35.267 --> 00:36.667
MAN: Whoo!

00:36.767 --> 00:37.900
Thank you.

00:38.900 --> 00:41.500
Hello, and welcome
to <i>Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us.</i>

00:41.567 --> 00:42.600
Here they are right now.

00:42.700 --> 00:44.700
It's the fabulous
Penn and Teller.

00:44.900 --> 00:46.700
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

00:50.600 --> 00:52.667
Gentlemen, fabulous to see you.

00:52.733 --> 00:54.167
Mr. Ross, sir,
always such a joy.

00:54.233 --> 00:55.400
Lovely.

00:57.100 --> 00:58.800
ROSS: Take your seats, gentlemen.

00:58.900 --> 00:59.933
(CHUCKLES)

01:00.067 --> 01:01.400
The show can begin.

01:01.833 --> 01:03.033
I like it.

01:05.867 --> 01:08.233
It's time to get excited
because we're about to see

01:08.300 --> 01:09.767
our first magician of the night.

01:12.800 --> 01:13.867
SCOTT ALEXANDER: <i>I'm Scott.</i>

01:13.967 --> 01:15.100
PUCK: <i>And I'm Puck.</i>

01:15.233 --> 01:16.567
Puck is my magic wife, uh...

01:16.633 --> 01:18.400
-(BOTH LAUGH)
-You know, we...

01:18.500 --> 01:20.433
I don't know if I like
that term, but, um...

01:20.533 --> 01:23.800
ALEXANDER: <i>I'm the kind of guy</i>
<i>who will throw anything in and try it,</i>

01:23.867 --> 01:25.933
<i>whereas Puck's</i>
<i>the kind of guy who has to know</i>

01:26.000 --> 01:27.667
<i>exactly what steps we're following.</i>

01:27.733 --> 01:29.933
PUCK: <i>But we both come from</i>
<i>the same school of thought</i>

01:30.000 --> 01:32.133
<i>when it comes to magic,</i>
<i>so we create very well together.</i>

01:32.267 --> 01:34.700
ALEXANDER: <i>Puck's the serious guy.</i>
<i>I'm the funny guy.</i>

01:34.767 --> 01:36.633
<i>But every once in a while</i>
<i>Puck has a zinger</i>

01:36.700 --> 01:38.267
<i>that comes out</i>
<i>and it's worth writing down.</i>

01:38.333 --> 01:40.133
The funniest lines
in the show come from me.

01:40.233 --> 01:41.567
(SCOFFS) Really?
Like which ones?

01:42.267 --> 01:43.333
Exactly.

01:43.433 --> 01:45.733
PUCK: <i>When we first started</i>
<i>putting our magic together,</i>

01:45.800 --> 01:47.200
<i>we wanted to do something</i>
<i>that was different,</i>

01:47.267 --> 01:49.500
<i>and we started just working</i>
<i>at our strengths.</i>

01:49.600 --> 01:52.133
<i>We're from different neighborhoods,</i>
<i>completely different backgrounds,</i>

01:52.333 --> 01:54.200
but yet when we put it together,

01:54.400 --> 01:55.833
it actually works.

01:57.867 --> 02:00.700
Please welcome
Scott Alexander &amp; Puck.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.733
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

02:07.500 --> 02:09.366
What we're actually
gonna do tonight is an escape.

02:09.467 --> 02:11.833
It's called
the "Escape from Alcatraz."

02:11.933 --> 02:14.300
And to help us out, please
welcome my partner in crime,

02:14.400 --> 02:15.600
it's Puck.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.000
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

02:18.833 --> 02:20.067
-Thank you.
-(CHUCKLES)

02:22.600 --> 02:24.100
Well, folks, you know, Alcatraz Prison

02:24.167 --> 02:26.833
was almost impossible to escape
from for two reasons in particular.

02:26.900 --> 02:29.067
First off, you had to get
through those solid steel bars,

02:29.167 --> 02:31.233
and, uh, second, you had
to actually make it off the island.

02:31.300 --> 02:32.667
And then, once you got off the island,

02:32.733 --> 02:34.200
you had to swim
a mile and a half

02:34.267 --> 02:36.300
through the icy waters
of San Francisco Bay.

02:36.567 --> 02:38.700
Yeah, plus, add the fact
that the brothers don't swim.

02:38.833 --> 02:39.867
(ALL LAUGH)

02:39.967 --> 02:41.000
ALEXANDER: That's true.

02:41.100 --> 02:43.300
We were able to acquire
one of the actual jail cell windows

02:43.367 --> 02:44.600
from Alcatraz Penitentiary.

02:44.667 --> 02:45.700
We brought it in here
with us today.

02:45.767 --> 02:48.133
-Yeah, we bought it on Craigslist.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

02:48.633 --> 02:50.000
(CHUCKLES) These bars come out

02:50.067 --> 02:51.367
because we want to take them out
into the audience

02:51.433 --> 02:52.633
and have you guys
check them out

02:52.700 --> 02:54.133
and get up close and personal with them

02:54.200 --> 02:55.833
and see that they are in fact legit.

02:55.900 --> 02:56.933
-Here you go.
-I'll take two.

02:57.033 --> 02:59.667
-Let's show the other side.
-Show the other side of the illusion.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.367
Has a screen right here.

03:01.433 --> 03:03.300
This'll become important
a little bit later on.

03:05.167 --> 03:06.833
Just a completely empty frame
and some bars.

03:06.900 --> 03:07.967
(BARS CLANGING)

03:08.033 --> 03:09.067
You guys,
would you check these out?

03:09.167 --> 03:11.100
You look like you
might be familiar with bars.

03:11.167 --> 03:12.800
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-I don't know...

03:12.900 --> 03:14.467
Look really good, solid?

03:14.600 --> 03:16.633
Okay, great, hand them back
to me when you're finished.

03:17.233 --> 03:18.600
Look good?
Okay, perfect.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.267
Now I hope you guys
checked them out really well

03:20.333 --> 03:22.200
because after you see us do
what we're about to do,

03:22.267 --> 03:24.067
you may wish you'd looked
just a little bit harder.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.967
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-Scott's gonna place these back inside.

03:26.033 --> 03:29.000
-There goes, first off, bar number one.
-Bar number one.

03:29.233 --> 03:30.333
Bar number two.

03:30.567 --> 03:32.333
Bar number two.

03:32.433 --> 03:33.900
(CHUCKLES) Bar number three.

03:34.033 --> 03:35.967
Bar number three.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.500
And lastly and finally,
bar number four.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.567
Bar number four.
That's a lot of bars.

03:41.667 --> 03:43.333
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

03:43.533 --> 03:45.533
(LAUGHS) We have some more things
we need you guys to check out.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.000
Oh, yeah, we got them over here.

03:47.100 --> 03:48.733
We brought them
in this suitcase.

03:49.533 --> 03:52.033
It's got a couple things
in here I want you to check out.

03:52.167 --> 03:56.967
Uh, first of all, we've got this set
of regulation handcuffs

03:57.100 --> 03:59.767
like you might find laying around
your bedroom at home, you know?

03:59.833 --> 04:01.233
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

04:01.367 --> 04:04.433
Also inside here,
I have another suitcase.

04:04.967 --> 04:07.900
Inside this suitcase
I keep something very special.

04:07.967 --> 04:08.967
(RATTLING)

04:09.033 --> 04:11.033
This is my ball-peen hammer.

04:11.367 --> 04:12.800
It's used for, uh...

04:12.900 --> 04:14.700
-Peening balls.
-Yeah.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.333
And if you've ever had your ball
peened before,

04:17.466 --> 04:18.800
you know it's very unpleasant.

04:18.899 --> 04:19.966
-Okay.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

04:20.067 --> 04:21.666
Also, another suitcase.

04:22.132 --> 04:25.633
And inside this one, I keep
something else very special.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.633
This bowling ball.

04:28.800 --> 04:29.800
(CLEARS THROAT)

04:30.667 --> 04:31.667
That's good.

04:35.133 --> 04:36.500
But this is not just any bowling ball.

04:36.567 --> 04:39.033
This is the Black Onyx Strike Master 3000.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.700
Penn and Teller,
I'd like you to have a look.

04:40.767 --> 04:42.467
Uh, it's hammer time.
There you go.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.333
-Ooh, can't touch this.
-(ALL LAUGH)

04:46.733 --> 04:48.533
I know, '90s reference.
And, Teller, would you please

04:48.600 --> 04:50.367
examine the ball?
What I'd like you to do, Penn,

04:50.433 --> 04:51.733
hit the ball, notice its tonality,

04:51.800 --> 04:52.900
make sure it's solid.

04:52.967 --> 04:54.400
Uh, check it for any soft spots.

04:54.467 --> 04:55.467
(THUDS)

04:57.667 --> 04:58.800
No hinges...

04:58.867 --> 04:59.867
(ALL LAUGH)

04:59.933 --> 05:01.100
Watch Teller's thumbs.

05:01.167 --> 05:02.433
He needs them
for the sleight of hand.

05:02.500 --> 05:03.700
Okay, cool?

05:03.767 --> 05:04.900
(ALL LAUGH)

05:04.967 --> 05:06.833
-Having a little too much fun with that.
-Yes.

05:06.933 --> 05:08.833
Wow, your attention
to detail is staggering.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.000
-Thank you so much.
-(ALL LAUGH)

05:10.067 --> 05:11.967
I'll take the hammer.
You're starting to scare me.

05:12.067 --> 05:13.300
(CHUCKLES) Okay, good, here we go.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.600
All right, back up here.

05:14.667 --> 05:17.700
Now, this bowling ball weighs
exactly eight pounds.

05:17.833 --> 05:20.367
It's exactly the same size
as a human head.

05:20.700 --> 05:23.633
In fact, it's exactly the same size
as Puck's head.

05:23.767 --> 05:26.433
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-See? Look, twins.

05:26.533 --> 05:27.833
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

05:28.467 --> 05:29.633
What? You don't see it?

05:30.433 --> 05:31.567
How about from this side?

05:32.567 --> 05:33.733
(ALL LAUGHING)

05:36.567 --> 05:37.900
(LAUGHS)

05:39.500 --> 05:40.567
All right, we're gonna
try one more thing.

05:40.633 --> 05:42.267
Jonathan, would you help us
for a second? Thanks.

05:42.333 --> 05:44.400
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)
-If you would, step behind the jail there.

05:44.467 --> 05:45.967
-Sure. Okay.
-And check the bars first.

05:46.033 --> 05:47.033
-Make sure they don't move again.
-Yeah.

05:47.100 --> 05:49.067
-This is a familiar view.
-(ALL LAUGH)

05:50.100 --> 05:52.133
And if you would, try to pass
the bowling ball through there.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.267
Sure.

05:53.333 --> 05:54.500
(RATTLING)

05:56.200 --> 05:57.967
ALEXANDER: See, the bars are staggered
in such a way

05:58.033 --> 06:00.300
that no matter how you try to shove it,
it won't go through, right?

06:00.367 --> 06:01.667
No angle works,
it won't go through.

06:01.733 --> 06:03.267
Yeah, the bars
are only five inches apart.

06:03.333 --> 06:05.200
The ball is actually
nine inches in diameter.

06:05.267 --> 06:06.500
Completely impossible.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.633
(CHUCKLES) But now we're going
to actually try to attempt

06:08.700 --> 06:10.833
to pass solid through solid.

06:10.900 --> 06:12.300
(MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS)

06:21.133 --> 06:22.567
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

06:28.533 --> 06:30.300
Thank you very much.
I'd like you to check this out.

06:30.367 --> 06:32.067
Why don't you get... Ooh!

06:32.167 --> 06:33.933
(ALL LAUGH)

06:39.567 --> 06:41.433
That one last bit
of security, folks.

06:41.567 --> 06:44.567
Uh, this set of handcuffs,
uh, that was on loan

06:44.633 --> 06:46.833
from the Las Vegas
Police Department.

06:46.900 --> 06:49.267
I'm gonna lock Puck
inside just like this.

06:49.633 --> 06:52.833
Now, you'll notice his hands
are locked through the bars.

06:52.900 --> 06:53.967
That's important.

06:54.200 --> 06:57.000
Now, we've seen an inanimate
object pass through.

06:57.133 --> 06:59.900
Now it's time to see
what happens when warm flesh

07:00.267 --> 07:01.733
meets cold steel.

07:01.900 --> 07:03.500
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKER)

07:31.667 --> 07:33.600
ROSS: Scott and Puck,
ladies and gentlemen.

07:33.667 --> 07:34.867
Let's hear it for them.

07:35.633 --> 07:37.400
Great job. Great fun.

07:37.467 --> 07:38.467
-(APPLAUSE CONTINUES)
-Thank you.

07:38.533 --> 07:40.667
You had them with the bowling
ball going over there then.

07:40.733 --> 07:42.367
So, Penn and Teller are gonna
have a think about it.

07:42.433 --> 07:44.200
They're gonna talk about whether
they know how you did that.

07:44.267 --> 07:46.067
It was a great act, I thought.
I enjoyed it thoroughly.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.567
Uh, let me ask you
a few questions about yourself.

07:47.667 --> 07:48.833
-You're both dads, I know that.
-PUCK: Yes.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.833
You both have children.
So, your kids must love

07:50.900 --> 07:52.033
having dads who do tricks.

07:52.100 --> 07:54.267
Yes, yeah, it's kind of fun
'cause they get to show off

07:54.333 --> 07:56.933
to all their friends, you know,
that their father does magic tricks, so...

07:57.000 --> 07:58.400
His daughter is quite the magician.

07:58.467 --> 08:00.100
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, she's really good.

08:00.167 --> 08:01.833
-She does the cups and balls trick...
-How old is she now?

08:01.900 --> 08:03.700
I got one that's three
and one that's nine.

08:03.767 --> 08:05.333
-Wow, so this would be the three-year-old?
-Yes.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.700
(ALL LAUGH)

08:06.767 --> 08:08.967
Uh, but the moment
I think that I most enjoyed

08:09.033 --> 08:11.833
and I know everyone did here...
Because I could see

08:11.900 --> 08:13.333
that you were gonna
do something funny on stage

08:13.400 --> 08:14.733
when you tripped
with the bowling ball,

08:14.800 --> 08:15.933
it wasn't just Penn and Teller.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.700
It was, like, everyone
over on that side of the audience.

08:17.767 --> 08:18.933
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-I think that should qualify

08:19.000 --> 08:20.033
as fooling them right there.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.467
I think you fooled them
in that moment so, you know,

08:22.533 --> 08:24.800
if that's all it takes,
then you've done it.

08:24.867 --> 08:26.333
Okay, I think you're ready.
Are you, guys?

08:26.433 --> 08:28.333
I'm gonna start by saying

08:28.767 --> 08:32.299
the switching the bowling ball
for a balloon

08:33.067 --> 08:34.900
is a gag that I know.

08:35.433 --> 08:40.267
I've seen other magicians do it
and I always laugh with glee

08:40.433 --> 08:41.799
when people fall for it.

08:41.866 --> 08:43.267
(ALL LAUGH)

08:43.767 --> 08:46.500
I don't know what it was.

08:47.667 --> 08:49.300
Maybe it's your acting,

08:49.867 --> 08:51.900
maybe it's the timing in the bit,

08:52.667 --> 08:53.933
but you...

08:54.300 --> 08:56.433
Got me 100%...

-(LAUGHING)
-...with the bowling ball.

I tell you, the bowling ball
thing scared the living Jesus out of me.

09:07.800 --> 09:08.800
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

09:08.933 --> 09:10.467
-That's hard to do.
-And I'm an atheist.

09:10.833 --> 09:12.367
(LAUGHING)

09:13.733 --> 09:18.300
This trick, uh, is a wonderful trick.
You added to it.

09:18.567 --> 09:20.900
You added to it.
I think the handcuffs is yours, right?

09:21.333 --> 09:23.533
PENN: And the handcuffs
is a really nice addition.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.333
It makes the topological puzzle
element of it

09:26.400 --> 09:27.433
much more complicated.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.600
That's a huge wrinkle

09:29.667 --> 09:31.033
to add to this trick.

09:31.200 --> 09:34.900
Having said that, pictures sometimes speak
louder than words.

09:34.967 --> 09:38.933
Teller's got a little picture
of the trick to show you.

09:39.033 --> 09:40.800
He's quite a little sketch artist there.

09:40.867 --> 09:43.000
Don't throw any bowling balls
at him yet!

09:43.067 --> 09:44.367
(ALL LAUGHING)

09:44.567 --> 09:45.567
(CHUCKLES)

09:46.600 --> 09:47.867
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

09:48.733 --> 09:50.967
Yeah, I would say,
uh, that's how it works.

09:51.033 --> 09:52.233
Yeah, he's got it.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.233
As always we're gonna
destroy the evidence...

09:54.300 --> 09:55.533
-Yes.
-(ALL LAUGH)

09:55.900 --> 09:57.600
...so that it doesn't fall
into the wrong hands.

09:57.667 --> 09:59.200
(WHIRRING)

10:00.033 --> 10:01.833
Let's hear it for our magic
shredder, ladies and gentlemen.

10:01.933 --> 10:03.367
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

10:04.900 --> 10:06.500
ROSS: Let's hear it
for Scott and Puck.

10:06.567 --> 10:07.900
Thank you, gentlemen. Great job.

10:07.967 --> 10:09.000
Thank you, Puck.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.333
Fabulous, wasn't it?

10:12.200 --> 10:14.800
Let's find out a little bit
about our next magician.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.267
ERIC JONES: <i>My name is Eric Jones</i>
<i>and I live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</i>

10:21.967 --> 10:23.200
<i>Now, when I first got into magic,</i>

10:23.267 --> 10:24.500
<i>I kind of used it</i>
<i>as a social crutch.</i>

10:24.567 --> 10:27.733
<i>I was severely overweight.</i>
<i>I was dorkier than I am even now.</i>

10:27.800 --> 10:29.633
(LAUGHS) No, let me do it again.
I'll do it again.

10:29.700 --> 10:31.467
<i>But since then I've learned</i>
<i>how to communicate</i>

10:31.533 --> 10:33.000
<i>and connect with people.</i>

10:33.600 --> 10:35.967
<i>For me, there's absolutely</i>
<i>nothing more fulfilling</i>

10:36.033 --> 10:38.967
<i>than finding and creating</i>
<i>the moment of astonishment.</i>

10:40.000 --> 10:41.500
-(WOMAN LAUGHS)
-And you'll notice one card

10:41.567 --> 10:42.833
comes rising out of the pack.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.267
I do not understand that.

10:44.333 --> 10:45.633
-Yeah, that one I thought...
-It's called magic.

10:45.933 --> 10:47.867
JONES: <i>I still consider myself a student,</i>

10:47.933 --> 10:51.000
<i>but people do look to me</i>
<i>for techniques that I've devised</i>

10:51.067 --> 10:53.167
<i>and my handling of coin magic.</i>

10:53.433 --> 10:56.533
Not only am I excited
about being on <i>Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us,</i>

10:56.600 --> 10:58.600
but I'm really looking
for the opportunity

10:58.667 --> 11:00.867
to share my magic
on a grander scale.

11:05.933 --> 11:09.833
This next magician is known
for his close-up magic with coins.

11:09.933 --> 11:11.000
I met him earlier today.

11:11.067 --> 11:12.467
I couldn't make heads or tails of him.

11:12.533 --> 11:15.200
Let's see if you can.
Please welcome Mr. Eric Jones,

11:15.267 --> 11:16.500
ladies and gentlemen.

11:18.267 --> 11:22.167
Tonight, I'm gonna share
something that's very dear to my heart.

11:22.233 --> 11:24.367
The problem with this illusion
that you're gonna see

11:24.433 --> 11:26.967
is that it's designed
for just a few people,

11:27.067 --> 11:29.167
and since there are so many
of you, I'd like to get

11:29.267 --> 11:31.467
a couple of volunteers to come
upstage to keep me honest,

11:31.533 --> 11:33.600
to make sure what everyone else
is about to see looks fair.

11:33.667 --> 11:35.100
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

11:35.167 --> 11:36.533
Now, here's the thing, guys.

11:36.767 --> 11:39.933
If I choose you, you might think
that we have something worked out.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.733
So, if you don't mind, Penn,
would you mind

11:41.800 --> 11:43.300
-just choosing a couple people at random?
-Oh, sure.

11:43.367 --> 11:44.933
-Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

11:45.000 --> 11:46.567
Who have I got that'll...

11:46.800 --> 11:49.367
There's a big guy with both hands up.
Get on up here.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.867
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)
-JONES: Yeah, one more.

11:50.933 --> 11:52.333
PENN: Are you waving at me
behind the camera?

11:52.400 --> 11:53.567
-Yeah.
-PENN: Get on up!

11:53.633 --> 11:55.333
JONES: Give these guys
a round of applause

11:55.400 --> 11:57.000
-as they make their way up.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)

12:02.900 --> 12:04.267
Guys, thank you so much
for joining me.

12:04.333 --> 12:05.533
-My name is Eric. Your name is?
-Kent.

12:05.600 --> 12:06.667
Kent? And?

12:06.733 --> 12:07.767
Molly-Ann.

12:07.833 --> 12:08.900
-Molly-Ann?
-Yes.

12:09.733 --> 12:11.233
Now, what I want you guys to do

12:11.300 --> 12:13.967
is pay very close attention
to everything you're about to see.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.067
I'm gonna use a little bit
of imagination.

12:17.533 --> 12:18.867
(AUDIENCE EXCLAIMS)

12:19.000 --> 12:20.267
-Ooh.
-Awesome.

12:20.367 --> 12:21.600
Isn't that kind of crazy?

12:22.100 --> 12:23.267
Now here's
the interesting thing.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.600
This is kind of like a...
A magic marker.

12:26.667 --> 12:27.800
It's actually where I keep my money.

12:27.867 --> 12:29.433
You know, in Vegas,
you got to be safe, right?

12:29.500 --> 12:31.667
-Okay, right.
-All you have to do is watch...

12:31.733 --> 12:33.900
-(CLINKING)
-...and you see a couple little coins.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.867
These are four solid silver,

12:36.933 --> 12:39.600
American half-dollars
from the turn of the last century.

12:39.667 --> 12:42.433
You guys can examine them,
make sure they are exactly

12:42.500 --> 12:44.000
-what they seem to be, yeah?
-(KNOCKING ON TABLE)

12:44.267 --> 12:45.400
Everything look good?

12:45.467 --> 12:46.533
KENT: Looks good to me.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.400
You guys will be the eyes
and the ears of the audience.

12:49.467 --> 12:50.700
And so it'll be your job, Kent,

12:50.767 --> 12:52.300
to make sure nothing
goes up the sleeve.

12:52.367 --> 12:55.100
It'll be your job to make sure
nothing goes up the sleeve.

12:55.167 --> 12:57.767
Watch everything you can
as close as possible.

12:57.933 --> 12:59.700
First, let me ask,
can you see all four coins?

12:59.767 --> 13:01.500
-I see all four.
-And you can see all four?

13:01.567 --> 13:03.500
-Yes, sir.
-Make sure the camera can as well.

13:03.567 --> 13:04.867
Watch close.

13:07.933 --> 13:09.233
(BLOWS)

13:10.300 --> 13:11.433
(KENT CHUCKLES)

13:11.533 --> 13:12.667
(CLINKING)

13:12.767 --> 13:14.533
-Oh, wow.
-Whoa.

13:14.667 --> 13:15.867
That's the first one.

13:16.233 --> 13:17.533
-MOLLY-ANN: Okay!
-That was good. That was nice.

13:18.033 --> 13:19.933
-That was nice.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

13:20.333 --> 13:21.900
Now, I know
what some of you might be thinking.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.767
I can almost sense it.
You're saying, "Eh,

13:23.833 --> 13:25.467
"it's just some
of that sleight of hand crap."

13:25.600 --> 13:27.267
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-There could be some truth to that.

13:27.333 --> 13:30.333
However, the entire
dynamic changes when the magic

13:30.400 --> 13:32.867
comes out of my hands
and into someone else's.

13:32.933 --> 13:34.000
-Yeah.
-Are you willing to help?

13:34.067 --> 13:35.067
-Sure.
-Let me ask you,

13:35.133 --> 13:36.433
-are you left or right-handed?
-I'm right-handed.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.600
Would you mind opening your right hand?
Place it above the table.

13:38.667 --> 13:40.233
I'm gonna get you to leave
those three coins

13:40.300 --> 13:41.467
right about there.

13:41.567 --> 13:43.167
So, you've got three,
I've got one.

13:43.233 --> 13:44.500
If you could,
take your other hand

13:44.567 --> 13:46.000
and cover the coins,
creating, like, a cave

13:46.133 --> 13:47.733
so you can see all three inside, yeah?

13:47.867 --> 13:49.600
-Okay, like that?
-Perfect, and there's mine.

13:49.700 --> 13:52.233
In a moment, I'm gonna
have you shake your three coins.

13:52.300 --> 13:54.733
I'm gonna shake mine.
You guys will actually hear

13:54.800 --> 13:56.367
the moment the magic happens.

13:56.433 --> 13:57.467
-Okay.
-Are you ready?

13:57.533 --> 14:00.767
-Yes.
-One, two, and three.

14:00.867 --> 14:04.100
Shake the coins and listen
to the sound the silver makes, Kent,

14:04.167 --> 14:05.833
not in your hands...

14:06.900 --> 14:08.433
(CLINKING)

14:09.567 --> 14:10.867
-But in mine.
-(ALL EXCLAIM)

14:10.933 --> 14:12.800
If you could,
dump the contents onto the table.

14:12.867 --> 14:14.267
-Show them what you've got.
-(KENT LAUGHS)

14:15.633 --> 14:16.667
Wow!

14:18.267 --> 14:20.333
-Whoo!
-Now, I know what you might be thinking.

14:20.767 --> 14:22.733
And, yes, it is a black thing.
You'll never understand it.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.033
-Yeah...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

14:25.100 --> 14:26.400
But would you like
to give this a try?

14:26.467 --> 14:27.867
-I would love to.
-Excellent.

14:27.933 --> 14:29.333
Are you left or right-handed?

14:29.467 --> 14:31.267
-Let's do the right.
-Let's do the right.

14:31.333 --> 14:33.333
Excellent. If you don't mind
showing the palm of your right hand

14:33.400 --> 14:34.467
to your audience.

14:34.533 --> 14:37.567
Allow your middle finger
and thumb to slowly come together.

14:38.100 --> 14:41.067
Turn the hand at the wrist
and then bring it above the table.

14:41.133 --> 14:42.167
Perfect.

14:42.267 --> 14:43.967
Then if you could,
turn your left hand palm up

14:44.033 --> 14:46.400
and place it about to inches
under the right.

14:49.833 --> 14:51.167
(ALL LAUGH)

14:52.533 --> 14:54.500
Now, guys, you'll notice how
I'm holding on to these two coins.

14:54.567 --> 14:55.567
By their edges.

14:55.667 --> 14:58.000
That way I can't manipulate
the coins in any way.

14:58.067 --> 14:59.533
If you don't mind opening
your middle finger and thumb

14:59.600 --> 15:00.767
of your right hand.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.200
Excellent, and grab
these two coins by their edges,

15:03.267 --> 15:04.633
-just like this.
-Okay.

15:04.700 --> 15:05.867
Excellent.

15:06.333 --> 15:07.733
Now, can everyone see her too?

15:07.867 --> 15:09.633
Yeah, and mine?

15:10.800 --> 15:13.367
In a moment, I'm gonna
have you drop these two coins

15:13.533 --> 15:14.800
onto the palm of your hand.

15:14.867 --> 15:17.300
-It's important that you catch the coins.
-Okay.

15:17.433 --> 15:18.933
Make sure they don't hit
the table or the floor.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.567
I'll do the same with my two.

15:20.700 --> 15:23.533
One coin will become invisible,
travel across the table

15:23.600 --> 15:25.633
to arrive inside of my hand.

15:25.733 --> 15:27.867
(BANGING TABLE) Does that sound
like a frigging miracle or what?

15:28.633 --> 15:29.767
KENT: I'm trying to see.
JONES: Right?

15:29.867 --> 15:32.333
It's gonna happen after three,

15:32.433 --> 15:34.067
meaning, "One, two, three,
Geronimo," okay?

15:34.133 --> 15:35.467
Okay, one, two, three, drop.

15:35.533 --> 15:38.433
One, two, three.
Ah, if you could,

15:38.567 --> 15:40.533
-(CLINKING)
-Ah!

15:40.867 --> 15:43.867
If you could slowly bring your hand
towards the center of the table,

15:44.067 --> 15:46.433
and one finger at a time,
dump the contents on

15:46.500 --> 15:47.533
and show them what you've got.

15:47.633 --> 15:49.833
-Whoa! Hey!
-She's got one coin.

15:49.900 --> 15:51.667
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)
-MOLLY-ANN: That's pretty good.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.900
You see, the thing about this
is it means absolutely nothing

15:53.967 --> 15:55.333
-unless...
-(CLINKING)

15:55.533 --> 15:57.100
-Unless...
-(CLINKING)

15:57.167 --> 15:59.733
There's one, two...

16:00.233 --> 16:01.233
(COIN THUDS)

16:01.300 --> 16:03.133
And three coins here.
High five?

16:03.267 --> 16:04.667
(AUDIENCE CHEERS AND APPLAUDS)

16:06.133 --> 16:07.733
-(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
-Wow.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.600
-One coin left to go.
-Wow.

16:09.667 --> 16:11.567
Now, guys, up until this point,
I've tried to move

16:11.633 --> 16:15.000
as slowly as I possibly could
to keep everything fair.

16:15.267 --> 16:16.933
But I want to make a pact
with you guys.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.133
If at any point, anyone,
including you guys,

16:19.200 --> 16:21.567
sees anything that looks tricky
or suspicious...

16:21.633 --> 16:22.767
-Yes?
-Be a jerk.

16:22.833 --> 16:25.900
Look me right in the eye
and say, "Eric, slow the hell down."

16:26.033 --> 16:27.800
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-Can we agree to that?

16:27.867 --> 16:29.733
-Yes.
-Four coins.

16:29.833 --> 16:31.333
Kent, if you don't mind,
just open your hand

16:31.400 --> 16:32.667
one more time for me, bro.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.900
-Can you see all four coins?
-Yes, I do.

16:39.967 --> 16:41.500
Please, show
your left hand empty.

16:42.233 --> 16:44.433
And then if you could, gather
the coins on the palm of your hand

16:44.500 --> 16:45.500
like a stack of poker chips

16:45.567 --> 16:47.233
and then show
your left hand empty again.

16:47.533 --> 16:50.433
If you could then, sir,
use just your middle finger and thumb,

16:50.500 --> 16:53.300
grab that top coin,
place it onto the palm of my hand.

16:53.533 --> 16:54.867
JONES: It's a lot of instructions,
isn't it?

16:54.933 --> 16:56.933
<i>And close your hand around</i>
<i>the rest of them.</i>

16:57.733 --> 16:59.433
I'm gonna bring your hand
to right about here.

16:59.533 --> 17:01.900
But squeeze tight.
Don't let me in no matter what I try.

17:01.967 --> 17:03.967
-Oh.
-And I might, all right?

17:04.032 --> 17:05.567
-(ALL LAUGH)
-The last one.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.067
-The last one.
-Oh, okay.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.833
All you have to do is watch.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
(BLOWS)

17:13.067 --> 17:14.233
(AUDIENCE EXCLAIMS AND APPLAUDS)

17:14.300 --> 17:17.800
Kent, if you don't mind,
slowly turn the hand like so

17:17.900 --> 17:20.200
and allow the contents
to fall from the hand.

17:20.267 --> 17:22.700
-(CLINKING)
-That's one, two, three, four.

17:22.767 --> 17:24.400
Give these guys
a round of applause!

17:25.367 --> 17:27.267
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING)
-JONES: Thank you so much,

17:27.333 --> 17:29.700
-and be careful on your way back.
-Awesome.

17:29.767 --> 17:31.233
Eric Jones,
ladies and gentlemen.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.000
-Eric, fabulous, mind-blowing.
-Thank you.

17:33.067 --> 17:34.167
-Such a great show.
-Thank you. Thank you.

17:34.300 --> 17:35.867
When did you start doing this?

17:35.933 --> 17:38.100
'Cause I know this is the kind
of illusion, this is the kind of magic,

17:38.167 --> 17:40.533
that takes real dedication to the craft.
So, how old were you?

17:40.633 --> 17:43.933
Um, I started magic when I was 19,
but this particular illusion

17:44.000 --> 17:45.733
I've been working on
for about eight years now.

17:45.800 --> 17:46.800
-Wow, wow.
-Yeah.

17:46.867 --> 17:48.800
And you know what?
I thought it was incredible.

17:48.867 --> 17:51.400
I know the audience,
you loved this performance, didn't you?

17:51.533 --> 17:53.400
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING)

17:53.800 --> 17:57.833
So, either way it goes,
you've made a lot of new fans right here.

17:57.900 --> 17:59.800
Okay, Penn, Teller?

17:59.867 --> 18:03.667
Boy, I love the close-up,
finger flinging stuff.

18:03.733 --> 18:04.933
I really love it.

18:05.067 --> 18:07.933
We have seen this kind of stuff done,

18:08.133 --> 18:12.233
uh, using the method we think
you used a bunch of times

18:12.300 --> 18:15.967
but not in spectators' hands.

18:16.567 --> 18:21.667
And using what you're using
takes such incredible skill

18:21.933 --> 18:24.300
and handling
of the audience members,

18:24.367 --> 18:25.967
and I must say,

18:26.100 --> 18:30.000
gonads the size of South American cities.

18:30.233 --> 18:31.600
(ALL LAUGH)

18:33.367 --> 18:34.833
But do you like pets?

18:34.933 --> 18:36.733
-I love pets.
-Do you like cats?

18:36.800 --> 18:38.233
-I do love cats.
-Do you like dogs?

18:38.300 --> 18:39.900
-I do, yeah.
-Yeah? I don't.

18:41.800 --> 18:45.400
But my children
really wanted to have pets.

18:45.467 --> 18:48.333
So, you know what we got?
We got a turtle.

18:48.867 --> 18:52.933
We actually got 12 turtles
that live in a little pond out back

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
-and those turtles...
-Penn, I'm sorry.

18:54.067 --> 18:55.133
Can we please get back to magic?

18:55.200 --> 18:56.367
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-Because it's lovely hearing

18:56.433 --> 18:58.100
about your home life
but no one knows

18:58.200 --> 18:59.900
what the hell you're talking
about right now.

19:00.067 --> 19:01.733
Well, I think Eric does.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.033
I love turtles, too.

19:03.233 --> 19:06.667
Uh, there was one turtle
that we could've used here tonight...

19:06.733 --> 19:08.667
-PENN: Yep.
-...but only for one aspect

19:08.733 --> 19:10.000
of the entire routine.

19:10.067 --> 19:12.100
PENN: Right, I will just say this.

19:12.167 --> 19:15.967
There are certain turtles
that are very, very rare and valuable.

19:16.033 --> 19:19.033
And if I had those turtles,
with their quality,

19:19.133 --> 19:22.067
I might keep them safe from other people.

19:22.133 --> 19:24.300
I might lock them up.

19:24.700 --> 19:25.700
No?

19:26.400 --> 19:29.500
No, you'd leave that turtle
just out there wild?

19:29.900 --> 19:33.400
(STAMMERS) Why are we talking
about turtles still?

19:33.467 --> 19:34.667
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS AND APPLAUDS)

19:34.733 --> 19:36.733
Everything on the table is examinable.

19:36.833 --> 19:38.333
You say examinable.

19:38.533 --> 19:40.200
-Yes.
-Does that mean un-gimmicked?

19:40.300 --> 19:42.300
-It does not.
-PENN: It does not.

19:42.433 --> 19:46.367
It becomes a judgment call
for the booth, I believe.

19:46.433 --> 19:48.333
-Johnny knows how the trick is done.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)

19:48.533 --> 19:49.933
Johnny knows what we've said.

19:50.900 --> 19:53.967
Via my earpiece, I'm hearing
from Johnny right now,

19:54.167 --> 19:55.733
and he's asked me to say...

19:56.033 --> 19:58.167
And it kind of breaks my heart
'cause we're going back to turtles.

19:58.233 --> 19:59.500
I'm warning you now.

20:00.067 --> 20:01.833
He said the turtle,

20:03.167 --> 20:04.900
whatever the hell that is,

20:05.233 --> 20:08.300
was only used
at the end of the act...

20:08.400 --> 20:09.433
PENN: Right.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.467
And he does not believe
you have successfully identified

20:12.567 --> 20:14.333
how the remaining part of the act is.

20:14.400 --> 20:18.200
So, that means Eric Jones
has fooled Penn and Teller!

20:20.600 --> 20:21.767
Beautiful, beautiful work.

20:22.400 --> 20:25.433
PENN: You like all my talk about turtles?
JOHNATHAN: I love the turtle thing.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.700
Teller's gonna give you your trophy.

20:27.933 --> 20:28.967
Look at that.

20:29.133 --> 20:31.833
And that means Eric
doesn't only get the trophy,

20:31.933 --> 20:33.733
he gets to come back here
and perform

20:33.800 --> 20:35.967
as part of Penn and Teller's
stage act is Las Vegas.

20:36.033 --> 20:37.367
-Yes! And we can't wait.
-That's incredible.

20:37.533 --> 20:40.167
What a great performance.
Congratulations.

20:40.400 --> 20:41.700
Okay, off you go.

20:42.967 --> 20:44.000
Wow.

20:44.100 --> 20:46.700
We have collected the best
magicians from around the world.

20:46.767 --> 20:50.200
And remember, we buy in bulk
and pass the savings on to you.

20:50.267 --> 20:51.600
Let's meet our next performer.

20:55.567 --> 20:57.333
MARK CALABRESE:
<i>Hi, uh, my name is Mark Calabrese.</i>

20:57.400 --> 20:59.100
<i>I'm from Palisades Park,</i>
<i>New Jersey.</i>

20:59.200 --> 21:01.933
I have been doing magic since I was
about seven or eight years old.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.800
<i>When I was younger, magic</i>
<i>actually helped me,</i>

21:03.867 --> 21:05.500
<i>uh, make a lot</i>
<i>of friends and break the ice.</i>

21:05.567 --> 21:07.567
I like to call myself a magic lifer.

21:07.633 --> 21:09.933
<i>I didn't really choose magic.</i>
<i>Magic chose me.</i>

21:11.267 --> 21:13.567
<i>I also got into wrestling</i>
<i>and mixed martial arts</i>

21:13.633 --> 21:15.867
<i>and I've competed</i>
<i>and grappled in tournaments.</i>

21:15.933 --> 21:18.200
About two years ago,
I almost quit magic.

21:18.267 --> 21:19.967
I felt like a ballerina
on a stripper pole.

21:20.033 --> 21:21.800
<i>Uh, I felt like I was just trying</i>
<i>to make ends meet</i>

21:21.867 --> 21:22.933
and I wasn't enjoying it.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.600
<i>My outlook changed</i>
<i>when I realized</i>

21:24.667 --> 21:27.400
<i>that I'm not curing cancer</i>
<i>or doing brain surgery,</i>

21:27.467 --> 21:30.233
<i>and I just looked at it as,</i>
<i>if I could make someone happy</i>

21:30.300 --> 21:31.867
<i>and forget their day</i>
<i>for just one moment,</i>

21:31.967 --> 21:33.067
<i>I've done my job.</i>

21:33.133 --> 21:35.233
Fooling Penn and Teller
would change everything for me.

21:35.300 --> 21:37.267
<i>I'm looking to use</i>
<i>my fighter mentality</i>

21:37.367 --> 21:39.567
to beat Penn and Teller.
I respect Penn and Teller

21:39.633 --> 21:42.433
<i>with everything they do,</i>
<i>but I'm also looking to take them down.</i>

21:49.200 --> 21:52.233
Our next performer
will be jumping off the top rope of magic

21:52.333 --> 21:54.433
and dropping an atomic elbow
on your imagination.

21:54.500 --> 21:56.967
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-Will you please welcome Mark Calabrese?

21:57.100 --> 21:58.900
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

22:02.533 --> 22:03.833
Thank you, Jonathan.

22:03.967 --> 22:05.300
Thank you, Penn and Teller.

22:05.433 --> 22:07.933
As a close-up magician,
I've always been envious

22:08.000 --> 22:10.933
of the big-time stage performer
because of, you know,

22:11.000 --> 22:13.500
the beautiful stage,
the lights, the... The pretty girls.

22:13.567 --> 22:15.367
You really don't get
that as a close-up guy.

22:15.467 --> 22:17.200
And I figured, since I'm in Vegas,

22:17.267 --> 22:19.767
I want to do a card trick,
uh, Vegas-style.

22:19.833 --> 22:21.267
So, Jonathan, if you
don't mind helping me out.

22:21.333 --> 22:22.533
-Sure.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

22:23.433 --> 22:25.467
Jonathan, what we have
here is a deck of cards.

22:25.533 --> 22:27.633
Please verify that's brand-new.
I haven't opened it or anything.

22:27.700 --> 22:29.300
Looks new to me, yeah, it's unopened.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.267
All right, and take that out
and just get rid

22:31.333 --> 22:34.633
of the advertisement cards
as well as the jokers on the bottom.

22:34.967 --> 22:36.033
Perfect.

22:36.100 --> 22:38.600
Now if Jonathan chose a card
and I found his card,

22:38.667 --> 22:39.800
that's a one-in-52 chance.

22:39.867 --> 22:41.867
It's impressive,
but I'm a magician.

22:41.933 --> 22:43.167
I'm expected to do
these kind of things.

22:43.233 --> 22:45.833
So, I'm gonna do
you one better, Vegas-style.

22:45.900 --> 22:48.333
I'm gonna not just do
a one-in-52 chance.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.633
I'm gonna do
a one-in-2704 chance, chance.

22:51.300 --> 22:52.900
But first, will you give it
a good shuffle, okay?

22:53.033 --> 22:54.200
Perfect, yeah.

22:54.467 --> 22:56.500
And what I'm doing here,
Mark, is learning on the job.

22:56.700 --> 22:57.867
-That's what I'm doing.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

22:58.100 --> 22:59.133
As long as you're
getting paid, right?

22:59.233 --> 23:01.367
(CHUCKLES) Okay, let's see.
Jonathan, take one card out.

23:01.433 --> 23:02.500
-Any one?
-Any one you'd like.

23:02.567 --> 23:04.267
Okay, I like that one there.
Perfect, okay.

23:04.367 --> 23:05.500
And with this marker,
if you don't mind,

23:05.600 --> 23:08.067
sign the face of the card.
Show it to the audience.

23:08.133 --> 23:10.733
Show it to Penn and Teller, of course,
and do not show me. I'll look away.

23:11.533 --> 23:12.900
Place it back
whenever you're ready.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.600
All set, okay.
Please give the deck

23:17.667 --> 23:20.133
a nice thorough mix-up as well,

23:20.200 --> 23:22.700
and then when you're done,
we'll place that back into the box.

23:22.767 --> 23:24.033
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

23:24.133 --> 23:25.533
(SOFTLY) I'm learning on the job.

23:25.667 --> 23:27.367
Professional, there you go.

23:27.433 --> 23:29.033
There. Hold it. There were go.

23:29.100 --> 23:32.000
Stuff, all right, so... And then we'll
get back to that deck in a second.

23:32.067 --> 23:34.300
Now, I told you
a one-in-2704 chance,

23:34.367 --> 23:36.967
and the way that we're gonna do that is,
uh, with, you guessed it,

23:37.033 --> 23:39.767
-51 other decks of cards.
-Wow.

23:39.833 --> 23:40.967
And these are all identical

23:41.033 --> 23:42.367
to the deck that's on the table.

23:42.433 --> 23:43.833
What I'm gonna have you do
is hold on to those cards.

23:43.900 --> 23:46.267
-ROSS: Okay.
-Okay, I'm gonna take your deck of cards

23:46.333 --> 23:49.233
and toss it into, uh, the bunch, okay?

23:49.300 --> 23:51.400
Now I want you just to give 'em
a good, thorough mix-up,

23:51.467 --> 23:52.700
making sure
not to drop anything.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.633
Now, since this is Vegas,

23:54.733 --> 23:56.700
what better way
to do a Vegas card trick

23:56.767 --> 23:59.300
with, uh, something
from Vegas itself?

23:59.367 --> 24:04.700
And what we have over here
is the Penn and Teller wood chipper...

24:04.767 --> 24:08.067
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-...of death, death, death, death.

24:09.133 --> 24:10.233
ROSS: Wow.

24:11.233 --> 24:12.900
By the way, I'm also gonna
do one other thing.

24:13.033 --> 24:15.933
And that's going to be
I'm gonna blindfold myself.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.200
Okay, now...

24:17.267 --> 24:19.200
-Is that wise near a wood chipper?
-(ALL LAUGH)

24:20.233 --> 24:22.433
(CHUCKLES) Basically you're gonna dump
the decks onto the table...

24:22.500 --> 24:23.500
-Okay.
-All right.

24:23.567 --> 24:24.833
And I'm going
to commit my decisions.

24:24.900 --> 24:26.800
What's gonna happen is
I'm gonna pick up the decks,

24:26.867 --> 24:28.633
and if I don't think your card
is in that deck,

24:29.200 --> 24:30.267
goes right to the wood chipper.

24:30.333 --> 24:31.367
Okay, so should I...
You want to do this now?

24:31.433 --> 24:32.900
Yeah, dump it, just
making sure that it doesn't...

24:32.967 --> 24:34.500
-Uh, nothing drops on the floor.
-Okay.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.067
-Beautiful, perfect.
-Okay.

24:36.833 --> 24:38.033
-All right.
-That's all of them.

24:38.100 --> 24:40.067
Now we have some ear protection.

24:40.133 --> 24:42.000
This thing is loud.

24:42.100 --> 24:44.533
So, if you guys are, uh...
Have sensitive ears,

24:44.600 --> 24:46.667
please put your fingers
in your ears.

24:46.767 --> 24:48.900
Can you also verify
that this blindfold is exactly...

24:48.967 --> 24:50.700
-I didn't hear you. I had these on.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

24:51.567 --> 24:52.567
(CHUCKLES)

24:52.667 --> 24:54.200
Can you please verify
this blindfold

24:54.267 --> 24:55.867
is exactly what it says to be?

24:55.933 --> 24:57.567
-Can't see through it, fair?
-Can't see anything.

24:57.633 --> 24:59.900
All right, all set.
So, I'm turning it on now.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.467
-Cover your ears.
-(CHIPPER WHIRRING)

25:02.833 --> 25:04.933
(LOUDLY) Now I'm gonna try to talk
as loud as possible.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.467
Hopefully this is loud enough.

25:07.067 --> 25:09.533
But, uh, you ready, Jonathan?

25:09.800 --> 25:10.833
Cool.

25:28.267 --> 25:29.467
-Jonathan?
-ROSS: Yes.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.833
-Hold these.
-Hold these?

25:31.900 --> 25:33.400
-Yeah, hold them.
-Okay, I got them.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.667
-How many decks are left?
-Huh?

25:45.733 --> 25:47.333
-How many decks are left?
-Oh, I don't know.

25:47.400 --> 25:48.400
Quite a few.

25:48.467 --> 25:49.733
Give me the cards
that are in your hand.

25:49.800 --> 25:51.100
-About 25.
-Okay.

25:51.967 --> 25:53.600
These... We don't need these.

26:01.333 --> 26:02.500
Hold this deck.

26:06.533 --> 26:08.200
How many decks are left
on the table?

26:08.267 --> 26:09.900
That's it. You got the last decks
in your hand

26:10.000 --> 26:11.200
-apart from this one.
-Okay, these are it?

26:15.767 --> 26:17.167
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

26:17.733 --> 26:19.000
Are there any more?
Are there any more?

26:19.100 --> 26:21.067
-One in my hand left.
-Hand me the deck.

26:22.967 --> 26:25.200
-Is the deck face down in my hand?
-It is face down.

26:25.267 --> 26:26.300
Okay.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.333
I know it's been
a long time, Jonathan,

26:44.400 --> 26:46.700
-but do you remember your card?
-Not really.

26:46.767 --> 26:47.800
(ALL LAUGH)

26:47.867 --> 26:49.367
Okay, well, here's the thing.
That's okay.

26:49.433 --> 26:51.100
-Because that's why I had you sign it.
-Well, I signed it.

26:51.167 --> 26:52.867
-That's a good thing.
-You remember your signature, right?

26:52.933 --> 26:54.133
-Yes.
-Okay, good.

26:54.733 --> 26:55.933
-ROSS: That is my signature.
-(AUDIENCE EXCLAIMS)

26:56.000 --> 26:58.233
-That was my card, ladies and gentlemen.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)

26:58.300 --> 27:00.267
Mark Calabrese!

27:01.467 --> 27:03.433
Nice job, Mark.
Come around the front here.

27:03.867 --> 27:04.967
Okay, you know how this works.

27:05.033 --> 27:06.100
Penn and Teller
are gonna talk to each other.

27:06.167 --> 27:07.800
They're gonna discuss
what they've just seen

27:07.867 --> 27:09.700
and whether they know
how it was done.

27:09.767 --> 27:10.867
Uh, let me ask you a bit
about yourself.

27:10.933 --> 27:13.100
So, you're a wrestler,
but you're kind of a real wrestler.

27:13.167 --> 27:14.700
This isn't the kind
of entertainment wrestler

27:14.767 --> 27:15.867
where it's all fixed in advance?

27:15.933 --> 27:19.967
Yeah, I mean, mixed martial arts, uh,
jujutsu, and basically beating people up

27:20.033 --> 27:21.367
is, yeah, my thing.

27:21.433 --> 27:23.867
I don't think I've met any other magicians
who do that as well.

27:23.933 --> 27:26.067
-You must be in the minority.
-Yeah, I mean,

27:26.800 --> 27:28.967
-I'm still nerdy, but I like...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

27:29.033 --> 27:30.100
-you know, I like to...
-You're nerdy?

27:30.167 --> 27:31.167
If you don't like my card tricks,

27:31.267 --> 27:32.400
I just punch you
in the face and that's it.

27:32.467 --> 27:33.567
Kick me in the head,
yeah, there you go.

27:33.633 --> 27:35.067
I'm gonna like your tricks
in the future then.

27:35.133 --> 27:36.167
-(ALL LAUGHING)
-Will you do me a favor?

27:36.233 --> 27:37.533
-'Cause I love your accent.
-Sure.

27:37.600 --> 27:39.300
Would you say,
"Are you looking at me?

27:39.367 --> 27:41.567
"Are you looking at me?
'Cause there's no one else here?"

27:41.667 --> 27:43.000
(ALL LAUGH)

27:43.233 --> 27:44.767
-Uh, really?
-Yeah.

27:45.567 --> 27:48.100
You looking at me?
You... You looking at me?

27:49.467 --> 27:50.933
I don't see anybody else here.
You looking at me?

27:51.000 --> 27:52.600
Wow, that's pretty good,
isn't it, ladies and gentlemen?

27:53.100 --> 27:55.733
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)
-(MARK LAUGHS)

27:56.167 --> 27:57.533
-Great job.
-I'm here.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.967
I've got no idea how you did it,
but of course, I'm not a professional.

28:00.100 --> 28:01.867
Penn and Teller are
at the very top of their game,

28:01.933 --> 28:04.267
so let's ask Penn
what the duo thought.

28:04.333 --> 28:06.433
Well, if we were doing this trick,

28:07.067 --> 28:11.100
we would've done it
with, uh, cards that were marked,

28:11.167 --> 28:12.567
which you could've brought out
at the beginning...

28:12.633 --> 28:14.733
-Okay.
-And then it's very, very easy

28:14.800 --> 28:17.933
to do a blindfold peak
down your nose.

28:18.000 --> 28:22.133
And Teller and I love, love,
love blindfold peeks,

28:22.267 --> 28:25.400
and we love, love, love
marked cards.

28:26.300 --> 28:28.133
-But we don't think you did it that way.
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLES)

28:28.200 --> 28:29.667
-Okay.
-We don't think you did it

28:29.733 --> 28:30.967
with a blindfold peek.

28:31.033 --> 28:33.067
We think you
actually did it tactilely.

28:33.133 --> 28:35.133
We think you were
actually feeling around.

28:35.300 --> 28:38.100
-Okay. Okay.
-And even though where you were

28:38.167 --> 28:41.667
feeling around would
still give you a blindfold peek,

28:41.733 --> 28:43.567
(STAMMERS) we don't think you did.

28:43.633 --> 28:47.767
We don't think the cards
were gimmicked when you brought them out.

28:48.100 --> 28:49.933
-Okay.
-We think that happened later.

28:50.033 --> 28:54.667
And I think the one thing I can
say is I like this trick quite a bit,

28:54.733 --> 28:58.500
but if Fred Flintstone
were watching this trick,

28:58.567 --> 29:01.567
if Fred Flintstone
had seen this trick,

29:01.667 --> 29:03.500
and if Fred Flintstone knew...

29:03.567 --> 29:05.533
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-...an awful lot about magic,

29:05.733 --> 29:09.000
and if Fred Flintstone was taking a guess,

29:09.067 --> 29:12.333
I think Fred Flintstone
might have said,

29:12.400 --> 29:16.367
-"Yabba, dabba, do."
-(MARK LAUGHS)

29:18.133 --> 29:22.500
Would Fred Flintstone have said,
"Yabba, dabba, do?"

29:23.267 --> 29:25.400
For a second, I thought you
just liked <i>The Flintstones...</i>

29:25.467 --> 29:27.633
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-...but he would say, Yabba, dabba, do.

29:27.700 --> 29:30.067
The rest of us feel like
we're just at a meeting

29:30.133 --> 29:32.467
of overly keen <i>Flintstones</i> fans...

29:32.533 --> 29:35.400
-(ALL LAUGH)
-...but presumably there's a code in that,

29:35.467 --> 29:36.967
uh, that you got.

29:37.033 --> 29:39.733
They're talking in code
so we don't get the tricks too easily,

29:39.800 --> 29:42.633
but yeah, you're fairly happy
that they've busted you here?

29:42.700 --> 29:44.333
I did not fool Penn and Teller,
but I'm happy to be here

29:44.400 --> 29:45.433
and I'm happy to perform
in front of you.

29:45.500 --> 29:46.633
And you did a great job.

29:46.733 --> 29:48.133
-Mark, you did a great job.
-Thank you.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.833
Super fun to watch,
and I loved being onstage with you.

29:49.933 --> 29:51.600
-Thank you.
-Mark Calabrese, ladies and gentlemen.

29:51.667 --> 29:53.433
-Great work. Nice to meet you, sir.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)

29:56.067 --> 29:58.400
Let's meet our next act.
We'll see if they've got what it takes.

30:02.533 --> 30:03.933
<i>My name is Paul Vigil.</i>

30:04.000 --> 30:05.567

<i>Some people call me a magician,</i>

30:07.700 --> 30:09.567
<i>others a mind reader,</i>

30:09.633 --> 30:11.867
<i>and some perhaps maybe</i>
<i>even some kind of psychic.</i>

(SNAPS FINGERS)

30:13.267 --> 30:15.367
<i>I grew up working</i>
<i>in a magic shop.</i>

30:15.433 --> 30:17.667

-studying shamanic medicines.
-(SNAPS FINGERS)

30:20.200 --> 30:22.767
Once the curtains open
or they introduce me,

30:22.833 --> 30:26.133
that's like "once upon a time"
and all bets are off.

30:26.200 --> 30:29.000
Point to me a spot
like right here or right here or...

30:29.067 --> 30:33.167
Magic can have a consciousness
expanding effect on people.

30:33.233 --> 30:35.233
Look at that.
I just don't understand.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.567
-Mind blown.
-(PAUL LAUGHS)

30:36.700 --> 30:38.633
Part of what I'm interested
when I perform magic

30:38.700 --> 30:42.533
<i>is a moment that transcends</i>
<i>to help people know that mystery</i>

30:42.600 --> 30:46.367

will begin to doubt.

Will you please
welcome Paul Vigil?

30:53.900 --> 30:55.500
(ALL APPLAUDING)

31:02.467 --> 31:04.000
(MOUTHING) Oh, no.

31:04.467 --> 31:06.333
Can I ask you to ponder
something for a second?

31:06.400 --> 31:08.067
Do you think it's possible
that somebody,

31:08.133 --> 31:09.733
maybe even, like, myself,

31:09.800 --> 31:12.000
could stand here
in front of a group of strangers

31:12.067 --> 31:14.933
and predict exactly
what they may or may not do?

31:15.300 --> 31:17.033
-I'm gonna start with you, Penn.
-Okay.

31:17.133 --> 31:19.167
Now, please, I have some
specific statements

31:19.233 --> 31:21.567
with which I'm going to attempt
to influence you with.

31:21.633 --> 31:23.700
I'm gonna start with you
and I'll use a few more.

31:23.967 --> 31:26.433
The response that I want
from you is a single digit

31:26.500 --> 31:28.300
between zero and 10.

31:28.367 --> 31:31.533
Not zero and 10,
between zero and 10.

31:31.667 --> 31:33.900
Now, you know that I'm
attempting to influence you

31:33.967 --> 31:35.200
and my statement is,

31:36.033 --> 31:39.367
"One, two, buckle my shoe,

31:39.867 --> 31:43.133
"blank, four, unlock the door."

31:43.700 --> 31:46.800
(CHUCKLES) You know what the obvious digit
would be to put in this blank spot,

31:46.867 --> 31:48.800
but if you had a choice,
you would say?

31:48.967 --> 31:50.067
-Two.
-Two.

31:50.133 --> 31:51.500
I'll record that here for later.

31:53.333 --> 31:57.200
And perhaps this gentleman
right here in the red plaid?

31:57.367 --> 31:59.167
Again, we haven't set anything up,

31:59.233 --> 32:02.233
nobody's approached you
and asked you to help me out in any way,

32:02.333 --> 32:04.000
and I promise, if you listen carefully,

32:04.067 --> 32:05.400
I'll make you look good, all right?

32:05.467 --> 32:07.833
The statement I have
to influence you is,

32:08.033 --> 32:12.067
"Snow White and the blank Dwarfs."

32:12.400 --> 32:14.133
And the digit
you would give me is?

32:14.267 --> 32:15.267
-Four.
-Four.

32:15.333 --> 32:18.433
So, we're starting off
with a two and a four.

32:18.500 --> 32:19.900
And lastly, Teller.

32:20.167 --> 32:21.567
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

32:21.633 --> 32:23.767
Please, again, listen carefully.

32:23.833 --> 32:26.533
I don't think that these
statements will work on everybody,

32:26.633 --> 32:28.567
but I think that
this one will work with you.

32:28.633 --> 32:30.100
And the statement is,

32:30.500 --> 32:34.667
"Blank blind mice, see how they run."

32:35.167 --> 32:37.300
Please, can you hold up
some fingers for me?

32:37.500 --> 32:38.533
One.

32:38.600 --> 32:41.000
So, 241.

32:41.067 --> 32:42.900
Do you think there's any way
I could come out here

32:42.967 --> 32:44.933
and predict
that I would get this number,

32:45.000 --> 32:46.533
241?

32:47.000 --> 32:48.733
Please, can I have
you come up here, Penn?

32:48.800 --> 32:50.933
Let's give him a big round
of applause, please.

32:51.033 --> 32:52.533

32:54.067 --> 32:56.000
-How's it going today, pal?
-I'm doing very well, Paul.

-How are you doing?
-Great, it's good to see ya.

32:57.833 --> 32:58.867
-Good to see you.
-Yeah!

32:58.933 --> 33:00.700
So, before I came out here tonight,

33:00.767 --> 33:02.300
-I took a business card.
-Uh-huh?

33:02.367 --> 33:04.667
I wrote three numbers
on this business card

33:04.733 --> 33:07.233
and then I put it somewhere
where everybody would know

33:07.300 --> 33:09.800
I wouldn't be able to touch it.
Any idea where that's at?

33:10.367 --> 33:11.500
Uh...

33:12.433 --> 33:15.867
Please, let me turn around.
Can you see that,

33:15.967 --> 33:17.867
pinned onto the back of my jacket?

33:17.933 --> 33:19.667
-Now, please don't touch it yet.
-Okay.

33:19.733 --> 33:21.400
That is legitimately
pinned on there

33:21.467 --> 33:23.167
and I am gonna have you verify that.

33:23.233 --> 33:24.767
-You can pull on that, please.
-Okay.

33:24.867 --> 33:25.867
It is pinned...

33:26.333 --> 33:27.833
-Yes?
-PENN: Very securely.

33:27.900 --> 33:29.267
PAUL: Go ahead,
you take the pin out.

33:29.333 --> 33:32.433
If I was to do that, they'd think
that's when I'm doing the sneaky stuff.

33:32.500 --> 33:34.767
And as you turn it over,
can you keep your thumb

33:34.833 --> 33:37.133
over those three numbers
that I've written on the other side?

33:37.233 --> 33:38.800
-Okay, I've taken it...
-I'd like you to be

33:38.867 --> 33:41.133
about surprised as everybody
else here, all right?

33:41.267 --> 33:42.633
-Open safety pin.
-Yeah.

33:42.700 --> 33:44.033
Dangerous, open safety pin.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-I don't trust you with this,

33:45.633 --> 33:47.067
and they don't trust me with that.

33:47.133 --> 33:48.567
-Okay.
-So, again, I asked you

33:48.633 --> 33:50.600
for a single digit between
zero and 10.

33:50.667 --> 33:52.767
-The number you gave me was a?
-A two, I believe.

33:52.833 --> 33:55.033
Two. Can you just slide over
to the first number,

33:55.100 --> 33:56.167
-and what number is...
-Two!

33:56.233 --> 33:57.933
-Yes!

-No, wait, hold on.

34:00.967 --> 34:02.567
There's two chances
for me to mess up.

34:02.633 --> 34:05.300
Sir, the second digit
you gave me was a?

34:05.367 --> 34:07.367
-Four.
-What's the second number on that pa...

34:07.433 --> 34:09.533
Second number there is a four.

34:09.600 --> 34:10.766

34:10.833 --> 34:12.100
PENN: Two, four.

34:12.533 --> 34:15.800
And lastly, Teller, you could've named
any number in the universe.

34:15.867 --> 34:18.533
Well, any number
between zero and 10, yes?

34:19.067 --> 34:21.733
The number you gave me
was the number one.

34:21.867 --> 34:23.533
One and... Oh.

34:23.600 --> 34:24.833
PAUL: What's the last number
I put on there?

34:24.900 --> 34:27.533
PENN: Two, four, one.
Written there...

Let me show
that to the camera and everybody

-Thank you.
-Good.

34:44.067 --> 34:45.400
Mmm-hmm.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.967
Okay, I think Penn and Teller

34:48.033 --> 34:49.033
-have discussed.
-They've deliberated.

34:49.100 --> 34:50.266
I think they've come
to a conclusion.

34:50.333 --> 34:52.766
Uh, you can tell us whether
they're right or not. But, Penn?

34:52.833 --> 34:57.900
One of the greatest tricks
in all of magic is that trick.

34:57.967 --> 35:03.333
It is simple, it is direct,
and it is absolutely impossible.

35:03.567 --> 35:06.967
It absolutely destroys.
Love it.

35:07.100 --> 35:08.600
Love it. Love it.

35:08.667 --> 35:10.133
Did you see the movie <i>Patton?</i>

35:10.467 --> 35:11.800
<i>-Patton?</i>
-George C. Scott.

35:11.967 --> 35:13.200
-Yes.
-You did?

35:13.367 --> 35:16.033
And there's a line
from that movie that I think will mean

35:16.100 --> 35:18.633
something very strong to you.

35:18.700 --> 35:21.333
At one point, he says about Rommel,

35:21.633 --> 35:24.100
"You magnificent bastard!

35:24.400 --> 35:26.467
"I read your book!"

35:26.600 --> 35:28.567
-Ah!
-(ALL LAUGH)

35:29.833 --> 35:33.100
"I read your book,
you magnificent bastard!"

35:33.233 --> 35:34.300
Okay.

35:34.367 --> 35:38.100
Paul put out one
of the greatest magic books ever.

35:38.233 --> 35:40.533
In that book is this trick.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.700
Teller and I both read it.
Teller and I both loved it.

35:44.767 --> 35:46.967
And we sat in the dressing room
and talked about

35:47.033 --> 35:48.933
how we could possibly use it.

35:49.000 --> 35:53.900
So we would never, ever,
ever have figured that trick out

35:54.033 --> 35:58.433
if we hadn't read your book,
you magnificent bastard!

35:58.500 --> 35:59.767
-ROSS: Wow.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS AND APPLAUDS)

35:59.833 --> 36:01.067
That's good enough for me!

36:01.133 --> 36:02.567
-Bravo.
-Perfect for me.

36:04.900 --> 36:06.567
Thank you, thank you.

36:06.700 --> 36:09.067
One last thing. Hi, Mom.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.233
-(PENN LAUGHING)
-There he goes.

36:11.333 --> 36:12.567
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
-ROSS: Well,

36:13.067 --> 36:15.333
now, Penn and Teller have
deceived and delighted audiences

36:15.400 --> 36:17.567
for over four decades,
but there's one trick

36:17.633 --> 36:19.033
performed by Teller on his own

36:19.100 --> 36:22.333
that has never been seen
on television until now.

36:22.400 --> 36:24.167
Ladies and gentlemen, "Shadows."

36:24.233 --> 36:26.067
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

36:51.200 --> 36:52.667
(AUDIENCE EXCLAIMS)

37:08.400 --> 37:10.200
(AUDIENCE CHEERS AND APPLAUDS)

37:10.967 --> 37:12.667
(CHEERING)

37:21.967 --> 37:22.967
(AUDIENCE MURMURING)

37:29.900 --> 37:32.233
-WOMAN: Oh!
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

37:36.700 --> 37:37.867
(AUDIENCE EXCLAIMS)

37:51.967 --> 37:53.500
(AUDIENCE EXCLAIMS)

38:10.900 --> 38:12.600
(AUDIENCE EXCLAIMS)

38:12.700 --> 38:14.300
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)

38:16.000 --> 38:17.867
(CHEERING)

38:19.067 --> 38:20.667
Oh, wow. Oh!

38:21.833 --> 38:22.933
Maybe later.

38:24.600 --> 38:27.433
Well, that is all the magic
we can cram into one hour

38:27.500 --> 38:29.700
and my wand
is limp from the effort.

38:29.767 --> 38:31.567
So, good night from all of us at <i>Fool Us</i>

38:31.633 --> 38:33.233
and good night from Las Vegas.

38:33.933 --> 38:35.567
