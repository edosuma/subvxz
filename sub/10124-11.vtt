WEBVTT

00:08.133 --> 00:10.100
O.K., MOM,
ABOUT YOUR NEW CAR...

00:10.100 --> 00:11.300
WE KNOW YOU GOT
TO BE PRACTICAL...

00:11.300 --> 00:13.734
SO THE FAMILY CAR
FOR YOU IS...

00:13.734 --> 00:16.100
THE TURBO-CHARGED
FERRARI TESTAROSSA.

00:16.100 --> 00:17.500
HOW MANY SEATS?

00:17.500 --> 00:20.834
TWO, WHICH IS ONE MORE
THAN THE HARLEY WE WERE
THINKING ABOUT.

00:20.834 --> 00:22.667
WHERE SHALL
I PUT MY FAMILY?

00:22.667 --> 00:25.367
CORY AND I'LL HANG ON
TO THE BACK BUMPER.

00:25.367 --> 00:30.100
WE'LL SIT MORGAN IN
THE BACK WINDOW AND
SHE'LL JUST KINDA...

00:30.100 --> 00:32.133
GUYS, THIS IS
YOUR MOTHER'S CAR.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.400
IT IS YOUR
MOTHER'S DECISION.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.367
SHE WILL MAKE HER CHOICE
IN HER OWN GOOD TIME...

00:36.367 --> 00:38.800
HOPEFULLY WHILE
THERE'S STILL FOSSIL FUEL

00:38.800 --> 00:40.200
ON THE PLANET.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.000
SOMEBODY, LOOK.
IS SHE SMILING?

00:42.000 --> 00:45.300
NO. SHE'S GOT
THE SAME GLAZED LOOK
ON HER FACE

00:45.300 --> 00:47.667
SHE'S HAD
THE LAST TWO MONTHS.

00:47.667 --> 00:49.100
IT'S THE VAN.

00:49.100 --> 00:50.100
NO!
NO!

00:50.100 --> 00:51.100
SHH. QUIET.

00:51.100 --> 00:52.200
GO AHEAD, SWEETHEART.

00:52.200 --> 00:55.033
THE VAN WOULD BE GREAT
FOR WHEN WE GO CAMPING.

00:55.033 --> 00:57.867
I CAN FIT ALL THE KIDS
FOR SOCCER,

00:57.867 --> 00:59.467
AND IT'D HELP WITH WORK

00:59.467 --> 01:02.400
'CAUSE I COULD PUT
THE PAINTINGS IN
FOR THE GALLERY.

01:02.400 --> 01:05.567
SO YOU'D BE HAPPY
WITH THE VAN.

01:05.567 --> 01:07.600
DO YOU SEE
ANY PARTICULAR COLOR?

01:07.600 --> 01:09.900
NO. THE COLOR'S NOT
IN FOCUS YET.

01:09.900 --> 01:11.667
TAKE IT FOR A TEST DRIVE
AROUND THE HOUSE.

01:15.100 --> 01:17.200
WELL, GENTLEMEN,
WERE YOU TAKING NOTES?

01:17.200 --> 01:18.200
ON WHAT?

01:18.200 --> 01:20.467
ON ONE OF
THE SUBTLE DIFFERENCES

01:20.467 --> 01:22.100
BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN.

01:22.100 --> 01:23.200
SEE, WE'RE MEN.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.967
WE LIKE TO RUSH,
RUSH, RUSH, RUSH.

01:25.967 --> 01:28.200
WE LIKE TO JUST DO IT,

01:28.200 --> 01:30.667
BUT WOMEN DON'T LIKE
TO JUST DO IT.

01:30.667 --> 01:34.867
YOU GOT TO BUY THEM
A CAR FIRST.

01:34.867 --> 01:35.934
JUST KIDDING.

01:35.934 --> 01:37.033
HA HA HA!

01:37.033 --> 01:38.400
I NEVER SAID THAT.

01:43.700 --> 01:45.567
SO WHAT'S HAMLET
SUPPOSED TO DO?

01:45.567 --> 01:46.934
HIS UNCLE
OFFED HIS FATHER.

01:46.934 --> 01:48.834
HIS MOTHER'S SLEEPING
WITH HIS UNCLE.

01:48.834 --> 01:50.500
HIS GIRLFRIEND
IS COMPLETELY SCHIZOID,

01:50.500 --> 01:53.834
AND PEOPLE ARE DROPPING
LEFT AND RIGHT.

01:53.834 --> 01:56.133
SOUNDS LIKE
THANKSGIVING
AT MY HOUSE.

01:56.133 --> 01:59.100
SO HAMLET IS FACED
WITH A TERRIBLE DILEMMA,

01:59.100 --> 02:03.900
AND HE FREEZES LIKE A BUNNY
IN THE HIGH BEAMS.

02:05.033 --> 02:06.400
FOR ME?

02:06.400 --> 02:07.500
SHAWN.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.367
WHEN YOU LOOKED AT ME,
I NATURALLY THOUGHT--

02:09.367 --> 02:11.367
JUST PASS IT.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.767
OCTOBER 1962.

02:17.767 --> 02:21.467
YOUNG PRESIDENT KENNEDY
IS FACED WITH A SEEMINGLY

02:21.467 --> 02:22.767
IMPOSSIBLE DILEMMA.

02:22.767 --> 02:25.600
MR. HUNTER, WHAT WERE
HIS OPTIONS?

02:25.600 --> 02:29.233
MARILYN MONROE
OR HIS WIFE?

02:29.233 --> 02:31.767
YOU NEVER DISAPPOINT,
MR. HUNTER.

02:31.767 --> 02:34.367
THANK YOU.

02:34.367 --> 02:35.367
CORY.

02:35.367 --> 02:37.367
AH, I KNEW IT. FOR ME.

02:37.367 --> 02:39.300
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE.

02:39.300 --> 02:41.133
PASS IT TO SHAWN.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.200
DO I HAVE AN UNLISTED DESK
OR SOMETHING?

02:48.200 --> 02:51.300
STACEY, LINDA,
LINDA, STACEY.

02:51.300 --> 02:54.500
I'VE NEVER BEEN
SO DEPRESSED
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.934
TWO BEAUTIFUL GIRLS
BOTH WANT YOU.

02:56.934 --> 02:58.200
THERE'S GOT TO BE

02:58.200 --> 03:00.934
A HOT LINE
YOU CAN CALL.

03:00.934 --> 03:03.900
WITH YOUR LUCK,
A GIRL WOULD ANSWER,

03:03.900 --> 03:05.033
AND SHE'D WANT YOU.

03:05.033 --> 03:07.834
IF I REJECT LINDA,
SHE'LL GET UPSET.

03:07.834 --> 03:09.100
AND THERE IS NO WAY

03:09.100 --> 03:11.667
I WOULD EVER WANT
TO SEE A POUT

03:11.667 --> 03:13.133
ON THOSE BEAUTIFUL,
FULL LIPS.

03:13.133 --> 03:15.367
ACTUALLY, IT LOOKS
PRETTY GOOD.

03:16.700 --> 03:18.200
WHERE DO YOU SEE THAT?

03:18.200 --> 03:19.867
BUT WHAT IF I
REJECT STACEY,

03:19.867 --> 03:22.667
AND SHE FLIPS OUT, GETS
A SEX CHANGE OPERATION,

03:22.667 --> 03:26.667
AND COMES BACK AS
A REALLY ANGRY MAN
SEEKING HER REVENGE?

03:26.667 --> 03:29.600
HEY,
I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.500
SHAWN, JUST CHOOSE.

03:31.500 --> 03:32.767
I CAN'T.

03:32.767 --> 03:34.200
YOU DID AT LUNCH

03:34.200 --> 03:37.200
WHEN YOU PICKED MEAT LOAF
INSTEAD OF CHICKEN.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.834
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

03:38.834 --> 03:40.033
WELL, I COULDN'T DECIDE.

03:40.033 --> 03:42.100
I SAW YOU GETTING
THE CHICKEN,

03:42.100 --> 03:44.800
SO I FIGURED
IF I CHANGED MY MIND,

03:44.800 --> 03:47.133
I COULD HAVE
SOME OF YOURS.

03:47.133 --> 03:48.600
SHE'S BACK?

03:48.600 --> 03:52.500
HOW DO YOU KNOW IF
YOU'RE HAVING AN IDEA?

03:54.000 --> 03:57.600
YOU ARE A SICK
AND TWISTED INDIVIDUAL.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.600
TO YOU.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.100
TO ME,
I'M A VISIONARY.

04:00.100 --> 04:02.734
IT CAN'T WORK.

04:02.734 --> 04:04.600
I DATE ONE
OF THE GIRLS

04:04.600 --> 04:07.300
WHILE YOU GO OUT
WITH THE OTHER ONE.

04:07.300 --> 04:09.300
THAT WAY SHE'S
OFF THE MARKET

04:09.300 --> 04:10.300
UNTIL I'M READY
TO DATE HER.

04:10.300 --> 04:12.967
YOU WANT ME
TO KEEP HER FRESH

04:12.967 --> 04:15.300
UNTIL YOU'RE
READY FOR HER?

04:15.300 --> 04:16.734
WHAT AM I,
TUPPERWARE?

04:16.734 --> 04:19.500
WHAT ELSE DO YOU
HAVE TO DO?

04:19.500 --> 04:20.767
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW

04:20.767 --> 04:22.734
MY CALENDAR
IS CHOCKFULL.

04:22.734 --> 04:23.734
OF WHAT?

04:23.734 --> 04:25.000
WELL, LOOK, RIGHT HERE.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.300
I GOT LINCOLN'S BIRTHDAY,

04:26.300 --> 04:29.000
AND AFTER THAT,
I GOT LINCOLN'S BIRTHDAY
TRADITIONAL.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.767
AND THEN THERE'S,
UH, VERNAL EQUINOX,

04:32.767 --> 04:35.300
AND, UH, CINCO DE MAYO,

04:35.300 --> 04:36.100
AND...

04:36.100 --> 04:38.000
AND REORDER
CALENDAR PAGES.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.100
I'M SO BUSY,
I CAN'T TALK NOW.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.100
SO YOU'RE GOING
TO DO THIS FOR ME?

04:41.100 --> 04:43.767
OH, OBVIOUSLY.

04:43.767 --> 04:45.100
YOU'RE A LIFESAVER.

04:45.100 --> 04:46.567
I OWE YOU.

04:46.567 --> 04:47.500
JUST CHOOSE.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.900
WHICH ONE AM I
BABYSITTING--

04:49.900 --> 04:51.600
MEAT LOAF OR CHICKEN?

04:51.600 --> 04:54.467
WHICHEVER ONE
COMES UP TO ME FIRST,

04:54.467 --> 04:56.100
I'LL GO OUT WITH HER.

04:56.100 --> 04:58.233
HI, SHAWN.

04:58.233 --> 05:00.667
LINDA.

05:00.667 --> 05:03.100
LINDA, CONGRATULATIONS.

05:03.100 --> 05:04.000
FOR WHAT?

05:04.000 --> 05:07.400
FOR LOOKING
VERY LINDACIOUS TODAY.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.133
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?

05:09.133 --> 05:11.000
NOT FOR ME.

05:11.000 --> 05:11.867
CALL ME.

05:11.867 --> 05:13.700
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

05:13.700 --> 05:15.700
I THOUGHT SHE WAS THE ONE.

05:15.700 --> 05:17.567
I DON'T KNOW.
I PANICKED.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.233
I CAN'T DECIDE.

05:19.233 --> 05:21.300
YOU TAKE STACEY.
I'LL TAKE LINDA.

05:21.300 --> 05:22.300
NO.

05:22.300 --> 05:23.900
NO.
THEN I'LL TAKE STACEY.

05:23.900 --> 05:25.700
SHAWN,
YOU'RE BEING GREEDY.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.000
NO, I'M NOT.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.567
I'LL GO OUT WITH DEBBIE.

05:28.567 --> 05:29.967
I WANT DEBBIE.

05:29.967 --> 05:31.300
THERE IS NO DEBBIE.

05:31.300 --> 05:35.000
SOMEWHERE
THERE'S A DEBBIE.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.934
[BELL RINGS]

05:41.734 --> 05:43.200
HEY, JOEY,
IT'S FRIDAY AFTERNOON.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.467
AIN'T YOU
FORGETTING SOMETHING?

05:44.467 --> 05:48.500
OH, YEAH, I FORGOT
TO CLEAN OUT MY LOCKER.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.100
YES, GENTLEMEN,
FRIDAY ALREADY.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.900
ENJOY YOUR WEEKEND.
DON'T GET TOO MUCH SUN,

05:53.900 --> 05:57.100
AND I'LL SEE YOU
ON MONDAY.

05:57.100 --> 05:58.667
LOOK AT THEM RUN.

05:58.667 --> 05:59.800
CALL ME SOFT,

05:59.800 --> 06:03.500
BUT I LIKE MAKING
PEOPLE HAPPY.

06:04.600 --> 06:05.667
SO I SAY TO MYSELF,

06:05.667 --> 06:09.033
HOW ABOUT GIVING
SOME LUCKY GIRL A CHANCE?

06:09.033 --> 06:11.834
I'VE ALWAYS
DREAMED OF YOU
ASKING ME.

06:11.834 --> 06:14.033
WHAT'S YOUR
NAME AGAIN?

06:14.033 --> 06:16.200
ROY WITH AN "R."

06:16.200 --> 06:18.133
SO ARE WE GOING OUT
TONIGHT?

06:18.133 --> 06:20.500
HEY, ROY, YOU
GOT TO SEE THIS.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.400
SOME GUY'S MAKING
A MAJOR FOOL OF HIMSELF,

06:23.400 --> 06:24.734
ASKING OUT THIS GIRL

06:24.734 --> 06:26.467
WHO'S TOTALLY
NOT INTERESTED.

06:26.467 --> 06:28.967
OH, WAIT. IT'S YOU.

06:28.967 --> 06:31.467
REALLY FUNNY, MATTHEWS.

06:31.467 --> 06:33.300
YOUR LOSS.

06:33.300 --> 06:35.000
IN TIME,
SHE'LL GET OVER IT.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.100
I NEVER KNOW
WHAT TO SAY

06:38.100 --> 06:39.867
WHEN CREEPY GUYS
COME ON TO ME.

06:39.867 --> 06:42.100
ME NEITHER.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.567
COULD I ASK YOU
A QUESTION, CORY?

06:43.567 --> 06:46.400
CREEPY GUYS DON'T
REALLY COME ON TO ME.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.200
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.600
I MEANT ABOUT SHAWN.

06:49.600 --> 06:50.734
IS HE AVOIDING ME?

06:50.734 --> 06:53.500
SHAWN AVOIDING YOU?
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

06:53.500 --> 06:56.300
YO, CORY,
I JUST WANTED TO...

06:58.233 --> 07:00.100
HE'S JUST SHY,

07:00.100 --> 07:02.934
ESPECIALLY AROUND
BEAUTIFUL GIRLS LIKE YOU.

07:02.934 --> 07:05.200
HE THINKS I'M BEAUTIFUL?

07:05.200 --> 07:07.100
HOW COULD HE NOT?

07:07.100 --> 07:08.600
I ALSO THINK HE'D SAY

07:08.600 --> 07:10.467
WHAT A NICE SMILE YOU HAVE

07:10.467 --> 07:13.867
AND HOW SMART
AND SWEET YOU ARE.

07:14.934 --> 07:17.200
HE'S INTIMIDATED...

07:17.200 --> 07:18.200
SHAWN.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.367
SHAWN? INTIMIDATED?

07:19.367 --> 07:22.500
WELL, IT'S HARD TO TALK
TO GIRLS YOU LIKE.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.033
SO HOW COME YOU'RE
NOT INTIMIDATED?

07:25.033 --> 07:26.600
WELL, IF YOU NOTICE,

07:26.600 --> 07:30.500
I'M NOT LOOKING
DIRECTLY AT YOUR SMART
AND SWEET SMILE.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.400
WOULD YOU?

07:39.734 --> 07:42.500
HEY, YOU GIRLS
WANT TO DANCE?

07:43.567 --> 07:46.467
O.K., SO DANCE.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.734
WHAT'D I SAY?

07:49.734 --> 07:51.200
YOU GO TO JOHN ADAMS HIGH

07:51.200 --> 07:53.300
AND YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
TO CHUBBIE'S?

07:53.300 --> 07:55.900
I HEARD
IT WAS A DIVE.

07:55.900 --> 07:58.567
IT USED TO BE.
NOW IT'S A RAT HOLE.

07:58.567 --> 07:59.934
HOW'S THE FOOD?

07:59.934 --> 08:02.100
FOOD?
IT'S A RAT HOLE.

08:02.100 --> 08:05.033
MAY I SEE A MENU,
PLEASE?

08:05.033 --> 08:06.600
UH, FIRST TIME HERE.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.834
EXCHANGE STUDENT.
LATVIA.

08:08.834 --> 08:10.600
<i>NICHT </i>MENU.
<i>NICHT. </i>

08:10.600 --> 08:15.000
YOU CAN'T JUST COME IN HERE
FIRST TIME AND ORDER.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.667
CHUBBIE DOESN'T
LIKE THAT.

08:16.667 --> 08:18.400
IF CHUBBIE DOESN'T
RESPECT YOU,

08:18.400 --> 08:20.000
HE WON'T FEED YOU.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.900
THEN WHAT DO I DO?

08:21.900 --> 08:24.700
HE'LL TURN AROUND
AND RAISE ONE EYEBROW.

08:24.700 --> 08:27.934
YOU'LL HAVE
A TWO-SECOND WINDOW
TO ORDER.

08:27.934 --> 08:30.500
YOU SAY TURKEY CHUBBIE.
HE'LL WIPE HIS NOSE.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.467
THEN YOU SAY,
"WITH EVERYTHING."

08:32.467 --> 08:34.000
HE'LL LOOK AT YOU HARD.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
IF HE ASKS
WHAT YOU WANT TO DRINK,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.200
YOU'RE IN.
YOU'RE SET FOR LIFE.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.100
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

08:42.100 --> 08:43.500
SO AM I...

08:43.500 --> 08:45.600
BECAUSE NOW
I CAN TELL YOU--

08:45.600 --> 08:47.900
SHH! HE'S STARTING
TO TURN.

08:47.900 --> 08:49.567
TURKEY CHUBBIE...

08:49.567 --> 08:50.834
WITH EVERYTHING.

08:50.834 --> 08:51.600
TO DRINK?

08:51.600 --> 08:53.200
WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND?

08:53.200 --> 08:54.033
SODA.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.667
YOU GOT DIET?

08:55.667 --> 08:57.900
HERE.

09:00.567 --> 09:02.300
HALF THE CALORIES.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.700
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYBODY COME IN HERE

09:05.700 --> 09:08.700
AND GET THAT KIND
OF RESPECT FROM CHUBBIE.

09:08.700 --> 09:09.967
YOU'RE A NATURAL.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.934
I HAD HELP
FROM THE BEST.

09:11.934 --> 09:13.200
THE BEST IS
REALLY SHAWN.

09:13.200 --> 09:16.300
YOU SHOULD SEE HIM ORDER.
I GET CHILLS.

09:16.300 --> 09:17.800
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

09:17.800 --> 09:19.834
I WAS GOING TO SIT HERE.

09:19.834 --> 09:21.500
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH NEXT TO ME?

09:24.400 --> 09:28.300
I DON'T KNOW. WHY DON'T
I GO OVER THERE AND SEE?

09:29.734 --> 09:31.100
WHEW.

09:31.100 --> 09:33.700
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S ACTUALLY VERY
NICE OVER HERE.

09:33.700 --> 09:34.700
WHY'S THAT?

09:34.700 --> 09:37.467
I THINK IT'S
BEING HERE WITH YOU.

09:37.467 --> 09:38.500
YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?

09:38.500 --> 09:41.033
YOU START OUT THINKING
ABOUT ONE PERSON,

09:41.033 --> 09:45.033
AND YOU END UP
NEXT TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

09:45.033 --> 09:46.133
OH, BOY.

09:46.133 --> 09:47.567
WHAT'S THE MATTER, CORY?

09:47.567 --> 09:49.900
I--I WAS JUST THINKING.

09:49.900 --> 09:54.300
DID YOU KNOW
THAT SHAWN IS MY FRIEND?

09:54.300 --> 09:55.967
YOU'RE SUCH A SWEET GUY.

09:55.967 --> 09:58.367
I LOVE THAT.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.867
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU JUST DID THAT.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.200
I'M...

10:07.200 --> 10:09.400
PRETTY SHOCKED MYSELF.

10:25.400 --> 10:28.734
BOYS, REMEMBER OUR
LITTLE TALK ABOUT WOMEN?

10:28.734 --> 10:31.834
ON THAT SUBJECT,
I COULD USE SOME ADVICE.

10:31.834 --> 10:33.000
GLAD TO, BUT FIRST,

10:33.000 --> 10:34.600
ADMIRE THE WONDER
THAT IS ME.

10:34.600 --> 10:38.667
REMEMBER I EXPLAINED
HOW WOMEN ARE
CREATURES OF PROCESS?

10:38.667 --> 10:40.500
MEN ARE CREATURES
OF ACTION,

10:40.500 --> 10:43.300
AND, I, BEING A MAN,
HAVE TAKEN ACTION.

10:43.300 --> 10:46.100
AMY, SWEETHEART,
CAN YOU COME DOWN
HERE, PLEASE?

10:46.100 --> 10:48.200
WATCH HOW SHE JUMPS
UP AND DOWN

10:48.200 --> 10:51.100
AND THROWS HER ARMS
AROUND MY NECK
WITH GRATITUDE.

10:51.100 --> 10:52.734
HI, HONEY.

10:52.734 --> 10:56.000
YOU KNOW HOW YOU HATE
THOSE PUSHY CAR SALESMEN

10:56.000 --> 10:57.600
WHO CALL YOU
LITTLE LADY?

10:57.600 --> 10:58.600
YES.

10:58.600 --> 10:59.667
WELL,
SUCH IS MY LOVE

10:59.667 --> 11:01.800
THAT I'VE SAVED YOU
FROM THAT.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.567
STEP RIGHT OVER HERE

11:03.567 --> 11:06.500
AND LOOK AT YOUR
BRAND-NEW, FULLY-LOADED

11:06.500 --> 11:09.133
1995 MINI VAN!

11:09.133 --> 11:11.367
ALAN, DID YOU BUY THAT?

11:11.367 --> 11:12.834
YES, I DID.

11:12.834 --> 11:14.000
SO WE OWN IT?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.033
YES. THIS IS NOT
JUMPING HERE.

11:16.033 --> 11:18.767
THIS IS NOT
WHAT I WANTED.

11:18.767 --> 11:20.100
WELL, YES, IT IS.

11:20.100 --> 11:21.734
IT'S GREEN,
BEIGE INTERIOR,

11:21.734 --> 11:23.500
JUST LIKE YOU SAID.

11:23.500 --> 11:27.200
ASK THE GUYS...
CORY, ERIC.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.100
OH, THANKS.

11:29.100 --> 11:31.967
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THIS.

11:31.967 --> 11:33.600
YOU SAID YOU WANTED IT.

11:33.600 --> 11:34.700
NO, I DIDN'T.

11:34.700 --> 11:36.300
YOU COULD SEE
YOURSELF IN IT.

11:36.300 --> 11:39.700
YOU WERE DRIVING
AND CAMPING
AND WITH THE KIDS

11:39.700 --> 11:42.133
AND SMILING
AT YOUR HUSBAND.

11:42.133 --> 11:43.500
JUMP, JUMP FOR THE BOYS.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.867
WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT A CAR,

11:45.867 --> 11:49.100
AND YOU JUST
WENT OUT AND
BOUGHT IT.

11:49.100 --> 11:51.767
WHAT IS IT
WITH YOU MEN?

11:51.767 --> 11:53.734
RUSH, RUSH, RUSH.

11:53.734 --> 11:55.800
IT HAS CUP HOLDERS.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.934
WHY DON'T WE TALK
ABOUT THIS

11:57.934 --> 12:00.066
IN THE OTHER ROOM?

12:03.500 --> 12:07.300
OH, YOU WANTED
SOME ADVICE
ABOUT WOMEN?

12:07.300 --> 12:08.500
YEAH.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.367
SO DO I.

12:10.367 --> 12:11.467
ERIC, HELP.

12:11.467 --> 12:13.934
DON'T COME TO ME
WITH YOUR SEVENTH-GRADE

12:13.934 --> 12:16.000
MILK-AND-COOKIES
SOCIAL PROBLEMS, O.K.?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.367
PLEASE. I'M IN DEEP
PERSONAL AGONY.

12:18.367 --> 12:20.800
I'M UP FOR A LAUGH.
LET'S HEAR IT.

12:20.800 --> 12:24.000
THERE ARE TWO GIRLS
THAT BOTH LIKE SHAWN.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.600
HE CAN'T DECIDE
WHO HE LIKES,

12:25.600 --> 12:29.100
SO HE GOES OUT WITH ONE
WHILE I BABYSIT THE OTHER.

12:29.100 --> 12:30.467
'CAUSE YOU'RE SAFE,
RIGHT?

12:30.467 --> 12:33.000
YEAH...
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:33.000 --> 12:34.467
I MEAN YOU'RE NO RISK.

12:34.467 --> 12:37.100
SHAWN'S SAYING
BY PUTTING THIS
GIRL WITH YOU,

12:37.100 --> 12:39.400
IT'S LIKE PUTTING HER
IN A STORAGE BIN.

12:39.400 --> 12:43.033
SHE'S PROTECTED.
IT'S LIKE SHE'S GOING
OUT WITH BUBBLE WRAP.

12:43.033 --> 12:44.233
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW

12:44.233 --> 12:47.100
THERE ARE WOMEN WHO THINK
I'M VERY DANGEROUS.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.700
LIKE WHO? GRANDMA?

12:50.033 --> 12:51.767
NOT JUST GRANDMA,

12:51.767 --> 12:54.700
ALTHOUGH SHE <i>IS </i>
VERY FRIGHTENED OF ME.

12:54.700 --> 12:55.700
WHO ELSE?

12:55.700 --> 12:56.900
LINDA, MY ASSIGNMENT,

12:56.900 --> 12:59.033
ALSO THINKS
I'M NOT SO SAFE.

12:59.033 --> 13:03.900
YEAH, WHAT'D YOU DO?
RUN WITH SCISSORS?

13:03.900 --> 13:05.300
I KISSED HER.

13:05.300 --> 13:07.033
CHUBBIES.
WHERE?

13:07.033 --> 13:08.400
LIPS.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.467
ALL YOUR PROBLEMS
ARE SOLVED.

13:11.467 --> 13:13.000
MY PROBLEM'S
JUST BEGINNING.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.567
I MEAN, I LIKE LINDA,

13:14.567 --> 13:15.700
AND SHE LIKES ME,

13:15.700 --> 13:18.834
BUT SHAWN DOESN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

13:18.834 --> 13:20.734
YOU WENT BEHIND
YOUR FRIEND'S BACK

13:20.734 --> 13:23.500
AND STOLE THE GIRL
HE WAS LYING TO.

13:23.500 --> 13:26.000
MOVIE-OF-THE-WEEK
OR WHAT?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.934
EVERYTHING'S O.K.

13:27.934 --> 13:30.400
YOU'VE GOT A GIRLFRIEND.
SHAWN'S GOT A GIRLFRIEND.

13:30.400 --> 13:31.767
YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:31.767 --> 13:34.300
I'VE GOT A GIRLFRIEND
WHO I CAN KISS ON THE LIPS

13:34.300 --> 13:35.834
WHENEVER I WANT...

13:35.834 --> 13:37.467
IF IT'S O.K. WITH HER.

13:38.967 --> 13:40.867
YOU'RE RIGHT.
EVERYTHING'S O.K.

13:40.867 --> 13:43.900
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
SHAWN BREAKS UP
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND.

13:43.900 --> 13:46.300
THAT CAN'T HAPPEN.
COULD THAT HAPPEN?

13:46.300 --> 13:49.800
MOST SEVENTH-GRADE
RELATIONSHIPS END
IN MARRIAGE,

13:49.800 --> 13:51.300
BUT YOU NEVER CAN TELL.

13:51.300 --> 13:53.133
ERIC, HELP ME.
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.600
YOU'VE GOT TO DECIDE
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT--

13:55.600 --> 13:57.867
YOUR BEST FRIEND
OR YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

13:57.867 --> 13:59.900
I DON'T WANT
TO DECIDE THAT.

13:59.900 --> 14:01.500
WHATEVER I DECIDE, I LOSE.

14:01.500 --> 14:04.500
YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED,
HE FINDS HIMSELF CAUGHT

14:04.500 --> 14:08.100
ON THE HORNS
OF AN AGONIZING DILEMMA.

14:08.100 --> 14:10.300
AND SO YOUNG
PRESIDENT KENNEDY,

14:10.300 --> 14:12.367
CHARGED WITH KEEPING
THE PEACE,

14:12.367 --> 14:14.100
FEARS
THAT HIS INEXPERIENCE

14:14.100 --> 14:15.934
MAY BRING ABOUT

14:15.934 --> 14:19.100
THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE ENTIRE WORLD.

14:19.100 --> 14:20.400
GIVE HIM A BREAK!

14:20.400 --> 14:22.367
THIS WAS HIS FIRST
BIG CRISIS.

14:22.367 --> 14:25.233
IT WASN'T HIS FAULT
HE LIKED THE GIRL.

14:25.233 --> 14:27.600
MR. MATTHEWS...

14:27.600 --> 14:29.000
YES?

14:29.000 --> 14:31.800
PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN.
IT'S NAP TIME.

14:35.300 --> 14:38.400
JUST ONCE, I'D LIKE
TO SEE A MOVIE

14:38.400 --> 14:40.667
WHERE NOBODY'S HEAD
BLOWS UP.

14:40.667 --> 14:41.700
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

14:41.700 --> 14:44.734
WHAT TYPE OF MOVIE
DO YOU WANT TO SEE?

14:44.734 --> 14:47.200
HOW ABOUT A ROMANTIC
FOREIGN FILM?

14:47.200 --> 14:48.600
OH, PLEASE.

14:48.600 --> 14:51.100
THEY DON'T EVEN TRY
TO SPEAK ENGLISH
IN THOSE MOVIES.

14:51.100 --> 14:55.000
I'M BEGINNING
TO THINK WE HAVE
NOTHING IN COMMON.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.500
YEAH?
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK

14:56.500 --> 14:58.667
WE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON.

14:58.667 --> 14:59.934
STACEY, SHAWN.

14:59.934 --> 15:01.567
BY THE WAY,
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

15:01.567 --> 15:04.767
YOU'RE LETTING A MOVIE
GET IN THE WAY OF A LOVE

15:04.767 --> 15:07.934
THAT SHOULD LAST
FOR ALL ETERNITY?

15:07.934 --> 15:10.200
LOOKS LIKE IT.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.033
LOOK, THERE'S
NO ONE THERE.

15:12.033 --> 15:15.567
YEAH. GOOD THING
I STILL GOT
LINDA ON DECK.

15:15.567 --> 15:17.100
YOU'RE A LIFESAVER, BUD.

15:17.100 --> 15:18.367
DON'T GIVE UP ON STACEY.

15:18.367 --> 15:19.934
THAT'S A SOLID
RELATIONSHIP THERE,

15:19.934 --> 15:23.734
A RELATIONSHIP
A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE DEPENDING UPON.

15:23.734 --> 15:25.100
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15:25.100 --> 15:26.967
YOU CAN'T LIVE
WITHOUT HER.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.767
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'RE GETTING NERVOUS.

15:29.767 --> 15:30.767
YOU'RE SWEATING.

15:30.767 --> 15:33.600
YOUR VOICE
IS GETTING HIGHER.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.967
NOW GO!

15:34.967 --> 15:36.400
GO GET HER!

15:36.400 --> 15:38.000
GO GET HER, MAN!

15:38.000 --> 15:39.133
O.K., I'LL GO.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.600
LOOK, YOU HAVE LETTUCE.

15:42.600 --> 15:43.800
YOU HAVE TOMATOES.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.500
WHY CAN'T YOU
JUST TOSS ME A SALAD,

15:46.500 --> 15:48.800
YOU GREASY, GREASY MAN?

15:48.800 --> 15:51.700
HEY, WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE?

15:51.700 --> 15:53.900
THE SIZZLER?

15:53.900 --> 15:56.600
STACEY, FUNNY
RUNNING IN TO YOU.

15:56.600 --> 15:57.500
YOU'VE BEEN HERE
BEFORE?

15:57.500 --> 15:58.600
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.900
I CAN NEVER GET THIS GUY
TO GIVE ME ANY FOOD.

16:00.900 --> 16:03.400
ALLOW ME.

16:03.400 --> 16:04.400
Turkey Chubbie.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.700
TURKEY CHUBBIE.

16:05.700 --> 16:06.900
With everything.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.500
WITH EVERYTHING.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.133
I AM NOT GREASY. I GLOW.

16:13.133 --> 16:14.400
WAIT. I DON'T LIKE TURKEY.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.867
THAT'S O.K.
IT'S NOT REALLY TURKEY.

16:16.867 --> 16:19.300
IT'S SO WEIRD SEEING
YOU HERE WITHOUT SHAWN.

16:19.300 --> 16:24.400
I JUST THINK OF YOU GUYS
AS SUCH A COUPLE.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.800
HOW LONG YOU BEEN
GOING OUT?

16:25.800 --> 16:26.600
FOUR DAYS.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.934
IT SEEMS LIKE...FIVE.

16:28.934 --> 16:32.233
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
THE NAME SHAWN RIGHT NOW.

16:32.233 --> 16:33.734
THAT'S O.K.
I UNDERSTAND.

16:33.734 --> 16:36.000
WHEN I WATCHED YOU
AND...

16:36.000 --> 16:37.900
MERL ARGUE,

16:37.900 --> 16:40.600
IT--IT TORE ME UP.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.500
IT DID?

16:41.500 --> 16:44.033
THAT'S REALLY SWEET.

16:44.033 --> 16:47.300
YOU WANT TO TALK SWEET?
MERL IS SWEET.

16:47.300 --> 16:49.667
LOOK, CORY,
IT'S JUST NOT WORKING

16:49.667 --> 16:51.500
WITH ME AND MERL.

16:51.500 --> 16:52.667
GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

16:52.667 --> 16:55.767
GO OUT WITH HIM
FOR A YEAR OR TWO.

16:55.767 --> 16:58.467
SEE IF IT WORKS,
I'M BEGGING YOU.

16:58.467 --> 16:59.567
CORY, WHAT'S
GOING ON?

17:01.400 --> 17:02.800
LINDA. LINDA, RIGHT?

17:02.800 --> 17:06.367
TURNING AROUND
WOULD ONLY CONFIRM
THAT IT'S LINDA.

17:06.367 --> 17:07.767
HI, CORY.

17:07.767 --> 17:10.900
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.
JOIN US?

17:10.900 --> 17:12.400
I'D HATE
TO INTERRUPT.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.200
WHAT, THIS?
THIS IS NOTHING.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.300
I SAT NEXT TO STACEY

17:16.300 --> 17:17.600
AND TOOK
HER NOTHING HAND

17:17.600 --> 17:20.100
TO TELL HER SHE
SHOULD KEEP GOING
OUT WITH SHAWN.

17:20.100 --> 17:21.667
All WE TALKED ABOUT
WAS SHAWN.

17:21.667 --> 17:25.400
DID HE ALSO SHOW YOU
HOW TO ORDER?

17:25.400 --> 17:27.133
YEAH, HE DID.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.467
SHOWS YOU HOW TO ORDER,

17:28.467 --> 17:30.967
GETS YOU ALL COZY
IN THE BOOTH,

17:30.967 --> 17:33.033
AND THEN, BOOM,
MAKES HIS MOVE.

17:33.033 --> 17:35.700
IS THAT WHAT
YOU WERE DOING?

17:35.700 --> 17:39.300
I COULDN'T.
I DON'T HAVE MOVES.
I DON'T HAVE BOOM.

17:39.300 --> 17:42.133
HE DID THIS TO YOU, TOO?

17:42.133 --> 17:43.867
YEAH. IT'S
A WHOLE ROUTINE.

17:43.867 --> 17:45.867
YOU'D THINK
HE'S SO NICE.

17:45.867 --> 17:47.834
HE LOOKS SO INNOCENT.

17:47.834 --> 17:51.233
I'M A NEWBORN LAMB.
BAA!

17:51.233 --> 17:54.500
AND THEN HE SNAKES
YOU AWAY FROM SHAWN.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.600
OH, POOR SHAWN.

17:56.600 --> 17:57.600
WHAT?

17:57.600 --> 17:58.834
HEY, GUYS.

17:58.834 --> 18:00.400
SHAWN,
YOU POOR BABY.

18:00.400 --> 18:01.867
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

18:01.867 --> 18:04.200
HEY, THAT'S MY POOR BABY.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.200
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,
CORY?

18:06.200 --> 18:07.734
NOTHING GOOD FOR ME.

18:07.734 --> 18:09.000
YOUR SO-CALLED FRIEND

18:09.000 --> 18:11.400
HAS BEEN SNAKING
YOUR GIRLFRIENDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.133
HE BUILDS YOU UP,
THEN MAKES HIS MOVE.

18:14.133 --> 18:16.400
NO MOVE.
HARDLY AT ALL.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.700
NONE TO HER.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.700
MAYBE A LITTLE OVER THERE.

18:19.700 --> 18:20.800
LISTEN,

18:20.800 --> 18:21.834
SHAWN, BUDDY--

18:21.834 --> 18:23.867
GIRLS, COULD YOU
EXCUSE US?

18:23.867 --> 18:26.834
I'LL SEE YOU LATER,
O.K.?

18:26.834 --> 18:29.000
AND I'LL SEE YOU
AFTER THAT.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.500
YEAH, FINE, I'LL OPEN UP
AN ANTIQUE SHOP.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.367
CORY, I ASKED YOU
A SIMPLE FAVOR.

18:37.367 --> 18:40.000
YET, YOU THOUGHT
I WAS SAFE, DIDN'T YOU?

18:40.000 --> 18:42.300
YOU THOUGHT
I WAS BUBBLE WRAP.

18:42.300 --> 18:43.500
WELL, I AM NOT SAFE.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.600
I AM YOUR MOST
DANGEROUS FRIEND.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.100
YOU LIKE LINDA.

18:47.100 --> 18:49.300
YEAH, I DO.

18:49.300 --> 18:51.867
THAT WAS NOT
PART OF THE PLAN.

18:51.867 --> 18:55.200
MAYBE I DON'T FIT IN
TO YOUR SAFE LITTLE PLAN.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.600
MAYBE THAT DAY YOU SAID,

18:56.600 --> 18:58.133
"CORY,
BABYSIT LINDA FOR ME,

18:58.133 --> 19:01.000
UNTIL I BREAK UP
WITH STACEY,"

19:01.000 --> 19:02.033
I SHOULD'VE SAID NO.

19:02.033 --> 19:05.467
I'M NEVER GOING TO BE
THAT STUPID AGAIN.

19:06.600 --> 19:07.867
BOTH OF THEM, RIGHT?

19:09.834 --> 19:13.300
I TURN AROUND,
AND THEY'RE BOTH
GOING TO BE THERE.

19:13.300 --> 19:16.000
YES, THEY ARE.

19:16.000 --> 19:16.934
LINDA, STACEY,

19:16.934 --> 19:18.667
WE THOUGHT YOU LEFT.

19:18.667 --> 19:20.767
BOY, WE REALLY
THOUGHT YOU LEFT.

19:20.767 --> 19:23.200
I FORGOT MY PURSE.
WASN'T THAT LUCKY?

19:23.200 --> 19:25.567
YES, VERY LUCKY.
HERE YOU GO.

19:25.567 --> 19:26.400
THANK YOU.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.133
AAH! WHAT ABOUT HIM?

19:28.133 --> 19:30.300
AAH!

19:30.300 --> 19:32.600
I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE
IS SLEAZIER.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.000
HE IS!
HE IS!

19:34.000 --> 19:35.400
YOU WENT BEHIND MY BACK.

19:35.400 --> 19:37.367
THAT'S 'CAUSE
I REALLY LIKED HER.

19:37.367 --> 19:40.000
I REALLY LIKED
THEM BOTH.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.500
YOU TWO ARE--ARE--

19:41.500 --> 19:42.600
SCUM!
SCUM!

19:42.600 --> 19:43.700
THANK YOU.

19:43.700 --> 19:46.467
YOU TREAT US LIKE OBJECTS,
NOT PEOPLE.

19:46.467 --> 19:49.133
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M REAL, REAL SORRY.

19:49.133 --> 19:51.000
I JUST HOPE WE CAN PUT

19:51.000 --> 19:52.667
THIS WHOLE
THING BEHIND US

19:52.667 --> 19:54.200
AND START FRESH, O.K.?

19:54.200 --> 19:58.934
CORY, I'LL THUMB WRESTLE
YOU FOR LINDA.

20:03.033 --> 20:05.000
SHAWN, THEY'RE CLAPPING

20:05.000 --> 20:06.800
BECAUSE THEY HATE US.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.033
OH.

20:08.033 --> 20:09.133
WELL, SAME TO YOU!

20:11.033 --> 20:13.367
YOU KNOW,
I MISS LINDA ALREADY.

20:13.367 --> 20:15.667
I MISS STACEY...
AND LINDA.

20:15.667 --> 20:16.667
AND DEBBIE?

20:16.667 --> 20:17.567
AND DEBBIE.

20:17.567 --> 20:19.700
THERE IS NO DEBBIE.

20:19.700 --> 20:23.300
WELL, THEN HOW COME
I MISS HER SO MUCH?

20:23.300 --> 20:25.567
BECAUSE YOU'RE NUTS.

20:25.567 --> 20:28.100
SO, HERE WE ARE,

20:28.100 --> 20:29.934
JUST THE TWO OF US,

20:29.934 --> 20:32.100
A COUPLE
OF DANGEROUS GUYS.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.200
ME, TOO?

20:33.200 --> 20:35.467
YOU? YOU ARE
VERY DANGEROUS.

20:35.467 --> 20:39.300
I AM NEVER GOING
TO TRUST YOU
WITH A GIRL AGAIN.

20:39.300 --> 20:41.133
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

20:41.133 --> 20:42.834
I LOSE
MY FIRST GIRLFRIEND,

20:42.834 --> 20:44.100
BUT MY BEST FRIEND

20:44.100 --> 20:46.367
FINALLY BEGINS
TO RESPECT ME?

20:46.367 --> 20:48.400
YEAH.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.467
I'LL TAKE IT.

20:59.500 --> 21:03.600
WE'D LIKE
TO RETURN THE VAN.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.300
WHY?

21:05.300 --> 21:06.600
IT'S KIND
OF COMPLICATED.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.367
THERE WAS A LITTLE
MISCOMMUNICATION.

21:08.367 --> 21:11.967
DID SOMEBODY ASSUME
THAT SOMEBODY ELSE
WAS IN A LIFE POSITION

21:11.967 --> 21:14.200
THAT THEY
WEREN'T IN YET?

21:14.200 --> 21:15.500
YES, SOMEONE DID.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.400
YOU SAID
YOU WANTED THE VAN.

21:17.400 --> 21:20.233
YOU JUST WENT OUT
AND BOUGHT IT.

21:20.233 --> 21:23.500
EXCUSE ME. THIS IS NOT
ABOUT ASSIGNING BLAME.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.300
THIS IS ABOUT
WHO YOU ARE

21:25.300 --> 21:27.300
AS INDIVIDUALS,
AS A DRIVING COUPLE.

21:27.300 --> 21:30.200
WHAT KIND
OF CAR DEALER
ARE YOU?

21:30.200 --> 21:32.367
I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR THAT WORD,

21:32.367 --> 21:36.300
BUT WHAT I WANT TO HEAR
IS THE SOUND OF YOU TWO

21:36.300 --> 21:38.200
LISTENING TO EACH OTHER.

21:38.200 --> 21:39.467
TELL ME ABOUT AMY,

21:39.467 --> 21:43.133
NOT THE AMY
THAT THE WORLD SEES,
BUT THE INNER AMY.

21:43.133 --> 21:46.500
I NEVER FELT THAT I WAS
JUST A WIFE AND MOTHER.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.734
HOW LONG
WILL THIS TAKE?

21:48.734 --> 21:50.300
AN HOUR TODAY.

21:50.300 --> 21:53.500
AND I SUGGEST THAT WE GET
TOGETHER AGAIN NEXT WEEK

21:53.500 --> 21:57.934
AND THE WEEK AFTER,
UNTIL WE START TO SEE
SOME PROGRESS.

21:57.934 --> 22:00.367
WELL, UH, TUESDAYS,

22:00.367 --> 22:02.367
UH, 3:00 OR 5:00
I'M FREE.

22:02.367 --> 22:04.233
TUESDAY'S GOOD FOR ME.
ALAN?

22:04.233 --> 22:06.667
I JUST WANT
TO BUY A CAR.

22:06.667 --> 22:09.300
I GIVE YOU MONEY.
YOU GIVE ME METAL.

22:09.300 --> 22:10.767
WE DRIVE IT HOME.
IT'S DONE.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.233
TUESDAY'S FINE FOR ME.
