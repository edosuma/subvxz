00:15.996 --> 00:21.229
We have with us today, a man
who scarcely needs an introduction.

00:21.335 --> 00:23.235
Pootie Tang,
good to have you with us.

00:23.337 --> 00:24.531
Sepatown.

00:24.638 --> 00:28.665
You've had incredible success
in lots of fields,

00:28.775 --> 00:31.801
music, films, martial arts, pottery.

00:31.912 --> 00:34.472
How do you do it?

00:34.581 --> 00:36.606
I'm a pone tonie.

00:36.750 --> 00:38.877
Got my dillies on a peppatain.

00:39.052 --> 00:41.020
l hear that.

00:41.154 --> 00:44.681
Pootie, a lot of young artists say
you are their inspiration.

00:44.791 --> 00:49.228
Well, l can't say the nay no,
my brother. Wa-da-tah!

00:49.329 --> 00:52.355
You've got a new movie
coming out, right?

00:52.499 --> 00:56.265
Yeah. lt's called ''Sine Your Pitty
On The Runny Kind''.

00:56.370 --> 00:58.531
And who's in it, besides yourself?

00:58.672 --> 01:02.574
There's Trucky, Bad Bitty, Dirty Dee...

01:02.709 --> 01:05.405
...Lacey, J.B....

01:05.512 --> 01:06.945
...Biggie Shorty...

01:07.047 --> 01:08.639
and Robert Vaughn.

01:09.616 --> 01:11.914
You have a clip you'd like to show us?

01:12.018 --> 01:16.216
Let's take a look at this clip
from Pootie Tang's new movie:

01:16.356 --> 01:19.052
''Sine Your Pitty
On The Runny Kine''.

01:27.067 --> 01:30.195
lt was the year 2001 .

01:30.303 --> 01:34.637
lt was the best of times,
it was the worst of times.

01:36.009 --> 01:39.137
The big city was thriving,
but the inner city was dying.

01:39.246 --> 01:41.441
Who was killing it?

01:41.548 --> 01:44.073
This man, Dick Lecter,

01:44.184 --> 01:46.812
head of Corporate America.

01:48.622 --> 01:50.613
But the people had hope,

01:50.724 --> 01:53.693
because there was one man
who could fight the power.

01:53.794 --> 01:56.194
One man who
could stop the madness.

01:56.296 --> 01:59.993
One man who could beat Dick Lecter
like the LAPD.

02:00.100 --> 02:03.763
That man...
that man was Pootie Tang.

02:09.109 --> 02:11.873
See that guy? That's Bad Bitty,

02:11.978 --> 02:14.640
the baddest drug dealer in town.

02:14.781 --> 02:18.581
Hey, Bad Bitty, here comes Dirty Dee.

02:22.189 --> 02:24.350
Dirty bastard!

02:26.993 --> 02:28.654
That's Dirty Dee,

02:28.795 --> 02:31.161
the dirtiest dude around.

02:31.264 --> 02:34.290
He handles all of
Corporate America's dirty work.

02:39.005 --> 02:43.271
Next to Dirty Dee...
that's Froggy, the enforcer.

02:43.376 --> 02:47.312
Yo, Bad Bitty, how you been?

02:47.414 --> 02:50.872
l'm bad, Dirty Dee.
You're still dirty, l can see.

02:50.984 --> 02:53.384
Lets deal, baby.

02:53.487 --> 02:56.047
- You got yours?
- Froggy.

02:59.893 --> 03:01.417
Dirty money.

03:01.595 --> 03:03.187
You got yours?

03:06.433 --> 03:08.833
How do l know if they're any good?

03:08.969 --> 03:11.028
Let's test them out.

03:12.973 --> 03:15.373
Hey, kid! Come over here.

03:15.976 --> 03:18.706
That's Kid, the dumbest kid in town.

03:18.845 --> 03:20.472
What do you want, mister?

03:20.614 --> 03:22.206
Here, have some of this.

03:22.349 --> 03:23.509
ls it candy?

03:23.650 --> 03:25.709
- Told you.
- Yeah.

03:25.852 --> 03:30.050
lt's the kind of candy
that you smoke out of a pipe.

03:32.792 --> 03:34.885
Pipe candy!

03:38.198 --> 03:40.223
Pootie Tang!

03:55.582 --> 03:57.379
Capachow.

03:57.484 --> 03:59.111
Yeah! Pootie Tang!

03:59.219 --> 04:03.383
Dirty Dee, you a baddy daddy
lamatai tebby chai.

04:03.490 --> 04:05.287
Get that Pootie!

04:44.064 --> 04:46.828
That's a canapan, all the way down.

04:48.268 --> 04:49.496
Mother...!

04:56.409 --> 04:58.934
Shut up, bitch.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.345
O.K., l quit.

05:09.689 --> 05:11.816
Run, Pootie, run!

05:18.598 --> 05:19.963
Come on!

05:20.100 --> 05:21.567
Get out, get out!

05:28.975 --> 05:31.000
Hiya, Pootie Tang.

05:54.634 --> 05:56.226
Sa da tay!

08:13.273 --> 08:17.039
Pootie Tang was born in a small town
outside Gary, lndiana...

08:18.311 --> 08:21.280
...and that town was called Chicago.

08:21.381 --> 08:26.045
Everyone noticed something different
about the way Pootie would talk.

08:26.152 --> 08:30.111
lt baffled everyone...
doctors, scientists...

08:30.223 --> 08:31.850
Let me put it like this.

08:31.958 --> 08:37.863
Pootie Tang is, was and will always
be too cool for words.

08:42.235 --> 08:45.204
Pootie Tang
was the most popular kid in town.

08:45.305 --> 08:49.469
We didn't always know what he was
saying, but we knew what he meant.

08:49.576 --> 08:53.637
l knew l was his best friend.
That's me, Trucky.

08:53.746 --> 08:58.046
He had a special effect on people,
especially the ladies,

08:58.151 --> 09:00.779
not girls, grown ass-women.

09:00.887 --> 09:05.415
- Hiya, Pootie Tang.
- l'm a tine cappy, my damie.

09:05.525 --> 09:07.755
Wa-da-tah.

09:07.894 --> 09:09.794
All right, Pootie Tang.

09:09.896 --> 09:13.992
But for some of the ladies,
Pootie was too hot to handle.

09:14.100 --> 09:18.161
Damn you, Pootie Tang.
l can't take no more of this.

09:18.304 --> 09:21.239
Who do you think you are,
treating me this way?

09:21.341 --> 09:24.833
l've had it with you,
you hear me talking?

09:24.944 --> 09:29.779
This is it, l'm finished with you.
Stay out of my life.

09:29.883 --> 09:35.844
You think l'm joking?
Take your shit and get out!

09:35.989 --> 09:38.822
Pootie Tang, l'm sick of you.

09:40.526 --> 09:44.223
Pootie...Pootie, don't go!

09:57.510 --> 09:59.273
Pootie Tang was an only child.

09:59.379 --> 10:03.076
His father, Daddy Tang,
worked hard to raise Pootie right.

10:03.182 --> 10:06.151
He had this belt.
He was so fast with it

10:06.252 --> 10:09.881
that before Pootie could do wrong,
Daddy Tang would set him right.

10:12.358 --> 10:15.486
Don't grab those peas
without asking your mama.

10:15.628 --> 10:18.222
May l dane
on the cammies, Mama Di?

10:18.331 --> 10:21.300
Yes you may, Pootie Tang.

10:21.935 --> 10:23.129
That's better.

10:23.269 --> 10:26.864
You got to have respect
to get respect, Pootie Tang.

10:28.508 --> 10:32.035
So, do you have any girlfriends
at school, Pootie?

10:32.178 --> 10:38.310
Mama Di, there's a sine tipi tai
in a classi ti, she's a solo toni.

10:38.418 --> 10:41.353
Don't you talk dirty
to your mama, boy.

10:41.454 --> 10:43.888
Always got your head in them girls.

10:43.990 --> 10:47.926
Put your head in the books
and leave the ladies alone.

10:48.061 --> 10:52.521
And that's how it was. Daddy Tang
and his belt were always there

10:52.632 --> 10:56.295
teaching Pootie the difference
between good and bad.

10:56.402 --> 11:00.600
When l say he was always there,
l mean he was always there.

11:02.175 --> 11:06.236
Pootie, let's steal some apples.

11:14.220 --> 11:16.984
When Pootie was six,
his mother died,

11:17.090 --> 11:20.890
leaving him and his father alone.
Pootie was very sad.

11:20.994 --> 11:22.655
l know, son.

11:22.762 --> 11:25.458
But his father was a comfort to him.

11:25.565 --> 11:27.897
Don't slurp your soup in here, boy!

11:30.937 --> 11:33.462
Two weeks later,
another terrible tragedy.

11:33.573 --> 11:36.804
His father was fatally injured
at the steel mill.

11:44.550 --> 11:46.609
lt was incredible.

11:46.719 --> 11:52.021
Only the third time a man had been
mauled by a gorilla at that steel mill.

11:53.693 --> 11:57.720
On his deathbed, Daddy Tang
had Pootie make a solemn promise.

11:58.765 --> 12:02.701
Pootie, l know l brought you up tough,

12:04.103 --> 12:06.230
but that's cos l love you.

12:07.440 --> 12:09.271
lt's tough out there, Pootie.

12:09.976 --> 12:11.876
You've got drugs...

12:11.978 --> 12:14.776
...crime...gorillas.

12:18.151 --> 12:22.986
l ain't gonna be here much longer.
So, l'm gonna give you this.

12:24.590 --> 12:27.388
Pootie, that's my belt.

12:28.227 --> 12:33.426
As long as you got right on your side,
you can whip anyone's ass,

12:33.533 --> 12:35.797
with just that belt.

12:38.738 --> 12:40.899
l know you love the ladies,

12:41.007 --> 12:44.443
and Lord knows the ladies love you.

12:44.544 --> 12:49.277
Don't let the ladies
come between you and the belt.

12:52.985 --> 12:55.852
Those were Daddy Tang's last words.

12:55.988 --> 13:00.220
''Don't let the ladies
come between you and the belt.''

13:02.428 --> 13:05.158
But there was something else
about the ladies

13:05.264 --> 13:07.824
Daddy Tang forgot to tell Pootie.

13:13.339 --> 13:17.503
Pootie Tang turned out just fine.
Daddy Tang would have been proud.

13:17.610 --> 13:19.339
Pootie had it all.

13:19.445 --> 13:21.936
Hit records, movies, magazine covers,

13:22.048 --> 13:25.916
fancy cars, famous friends,
beautiful clothes

13:26.018 --> 13:28.851
and ladies, ladies, ladies.

13:30.957 --> 13:33.084
Through it all,
l was right there by his side.

13:33.226 --> 13:35.194
That's me, Trucky.

13:35.294 --> 13:39.390
And that's my man,
Pootie Tang.

13:39.499 --> 13:44.095
Big-time celebrity, crime fighter
and role model to children.

13:44.203 --> 13:46.433
Pootie Tang has a message

13:46.572 --> 13:48.665
for the children of America.

13:48.808 --> 13:51.470
So you better wapatah
to the bammies,

13:51.611 --> 13:53.670
cos the cammietowns a biddie

13:53.813 --> 13:55.713
on the Pannie Stai!

13:55.882 --> 13:58.544
Pootie says cigarettes and fast food

13:58.684 --> 14:00.879
are bad like netatai.

14:01.020 --> 14:03.887
And don't drink malt liquor
cos you don't need to,

14:03.990 --> 14:06.458
cos you're O.K., sa da tay.

14:06.626 --> 14:11.791
Also, eat all your vegetables,
and don't bang the dillies.

14:25.178 --> 14:26.236
That's Frank.

14:26.345 --> 14:28.279
Dick Lecter's right hand man.

14:29.248 --> 14:31.113
So what do we care?

14:31.250 --> 14:33.912
We care because he's making these.

14:34.053 --> 14:38.251
People have been making P.S.A.'s
for years. lt hasn't made a difference.

14:40.927 --> 14:43.725
Eddie, hit me with those figures.

14:43.863 --> 14:46.889
Since the inception
of Pootie Tang's PSA campaign,

14:46.999 --> 14:50.526
sales of Lecter burgers
are down 30 per cent,

14:50.636 --> 14:52.934
Lecter cigarettes down 20 per cent

14:53.039 --> 14:56.907
and Lecter whisky
is almost out of business.

14:57.009 --> 15:00.172
Someone's getting to these kids
and it's killing us.

15:00.279 --> 15:01.940
lt's killing us.

15:02.081 --> 15:04.174
lt's killing us.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.957
Hello, Mr. Lecter.

15:16.062 --> 15:20.158
- Frank, l have a job for you.
- Yes, sir.

15:20.733 --> 15:23.531
l'll tell you, Pootie Tang's
one bad brother, man.

15:23.636 --> 15:25.661
That's J.B. and Lacey.

15:25.771 --> 15:27.602
We make up Pootie's crew.

15:27.707 --> 15:31.837
Pootie Tang will draw you a picture
of how he's gonna kick your ass

15:31.978 --> 15:34.412
then mail it to you
ten days in advance.

15:34.580 --> 15:37.913
The picture gets there.
You go, ''What the hell is this?''

15:38.050 --> 15:41.645
Then he knocks on your door,
properly kicks your ass,

15:41.787 --> 15:43.982
and you still won't know
what happened.

15:44.123 --> 15:47.718
Got that right.
He's a kick-ass artiste.

15:47.860 --> 15:50.727
He's like the Da Vinci of ass-kicking.
That's him right?

15:50.863 --> 15:53.798
Pootie Tang,
the Da Vinci of ass-kicking.

15:53.933 --> 15:59.030
Pootie Tang whips your ass so bad,
you can write it off on your taxes.

15:59.171 --> 16:03.540
Right here. Ass whipping number one,
ass whipping number two...

16:03.676 --> 16:05.473
That's just getting beat up.

16:05.611 --> 16:10.139
l'd also like to add that Pootie Tang
can kick some ass too, boy.

16:10.950 --> 16:13.145
Here comes Pootie Tang now.

16:13.286 --> 16:16.778
- Hey, Pootie!
- We were just talking about you.

16:18.791 --> 16:21.624
Hey man, you going
to Biggie Shorty's party tomorrow?

16:21.761 --> 16:24.286
l guess you're wondering
who is Biggie Shorty.

16:28.567 --> 16:30.899
l'm Biggie Shorty.

16:31.704 --> 16:35.071
l'll tell you about me and Pootie Tang.

16:36.208 --> 16:40.406
Since the very day we met,
l knew Pootie was to be my man.

16:43.049 --> 16:46.109
l knew all l had to do was wait.

16:49.355 --> 16:55.191
One day, all that bullshit would catch
up with Pootie and he would be mine.

16:55.328 --> 16:57.523
You going to Biggie Shorty's party
tomorrow?

16:57.663 --> 16:59.597
Ranacan.

17:00.533 --> 17:02.228
You're a party man!

17:02.401 --> 17:04.800
There's gonna be
some bitches in there!

17:05.971 --> 17:09.372
You right, respect the women.
Respect the women.

17:15.815 --> 17:18.010
Look at that car!

17:18.117 --> 17:22.986
Man, that car's big.
And long like a whole snake.

17:23.089 --> 17:25.454
That car's so big,
it's got its own sky.

17:25.590 --> 17:27.218
Yeah, it's big too.

17:29.562 --> 17:32.053
- Keep it running.
- Yes, sir.

17:32.198 --> 17:33.995
Hiya, fellas!

17:34.266 --> 17:36.564
Kinda hot for a hootenanny, huh?

17:36.669 --> 17:40.867
Hear that? A hootenanny.
What the hell is a damn hootenanny?

17:40.973 --> 17:43.908
l'm looking for Pootie Tang.

17:44.043 --> 17:46.978
Pootie Tang.
What do you want with Pootie Tang?

17:47.113 --> 17:49.673
l need to talk to him.

17:51.851 --> 17:56.686
l'm a representative of Lecter Corp.
Do you know what that is?

17:57.857 --> 17:58.881
Great.

17:59.058 --> 18:03.654
Dick Lecter,
the CEO of Lecter Corp. likes you.

18:03.863 --> 18:07.856
He likes you, Pootie. He wants
to make you a very rich man.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.868
l have a contract here
for Pootie to endorse.

18:12.004 --> 18:14.199
Tasty heavy pork chunk cereal.

18:14.340 --> 18:16.831
lt's delicious.
lt's a wonderful product.

18:16.976 --> 18:22.039
Kids love it and kids love you.
We just want to put that together.

18:22.715 --> 18:27.379
Nah di. That's a canapan
to the senachai.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.681
l didn't even say how much it pays.

18:29.822 --> 18:32.882
20 million dollars to sign
for just one year.

18:33.959 --> 18:35.950
What do you say, Pootie?

18:36.128 --> 18:40.155
l got to say the nay no, my brother.
Wa-da-tah.

18:40.299 --> 18:45.100
Wa-da-tah? How do you say
the nay no to 20 million, why?

18:45.237 --> 18:49.173
Maybe Pootie don't wanna sign
because he knows you're full of it.

18:49.942 --> 18:53.105
First of all,
he knows that cereal's full of sugar.

18:53.245 --> 18:56.214
Number two,
that's not all that you guys sell.

18:56.348 --> 19:02.014
You sell cigarettes, whisky,
burgers, switchblades,

19:02.154 --> 19:06.614
and it also says you will no longer
let Pootie do P.S.A's.

19:06.759 --> 19:09.523
telling kids to eat healthy
and to be smart.

19:09.662 --> 19:11.755
Sure, exclusivity goes without saying.

19:11.897 --> 19:14.991
l'm sure your ugly intentions
go without saying.

19:15.734 --> 19:17.361
Take a walk, money man.

19:21.474 --> 19:22.839
See my damie?

19:23.008 --> 19:26.637
Pootie Tang don't wa-da-tah
to the shana cow

19:26.779 --> 19:30.044
cos that's my cama cama
leepa-chai, dig?

19:30.716 --> 19:33.981
Hey Tang, to you they're children,
to me they're dollar signs.

19:39.492 --> 19:40.754
Cover your grill!

19:40.893 --> 19:42.224
Sa da tay!

19:49.735 --> 19:52.431
You're funny man,
you are a funny man.

19:52.571 --> 19:54.004
Wild boy!

19:54.139 --> 19:56.835
Pootie smacked the taste
out of Frank's mouth.

19:56.976 --> 19:59.501
Man, that was a funny time.

19:59.645 --> 20:02.614
But one man was not laughing at all.

20:05.451 --> 20:08.579
Pootie Tang goes out there
and makes everybody love him.

20:09.722 --> 20:13.055
And he tells them
not to buy my products.

20:13.826 --> 20:15.589
He steals from me.

20:16.729 --> 20:21.291
What do l do?
l say take my money, here take it.

20:22.768 --> 20:24.633
And he says no.

20:24.770 --> 20:27.500
l guess you're wondering,
who is this bitch?

20:27.640 --> 20:28.800
That's lreenie,

20:28.941 --> 20:30.806
Dick Lecter's main squeeze,

20:30.976 --> 20:33.877
and the most dangerous woman
on the planet.

20:34.013 --> 20:37.073
She don't look it,
but she can bring any man down.

20:37.249 --> 20:43.279
l know what makes Pootie Tang...
tick...tock...tick.

21:00.739 --> 21:03.401
That's cool. All right.

21:12.318 --> 21:15.913
lt's all gone now, Pootie.
What do you wanna do?

21:16.055 --> 21:17.613
Lepatime.

21:21.794 --> 21:23.694
What's he got on his mind?

21:23.829 --> 21:26.263
We're starting from scratch, l guess.

21:26.398 --> 21:28.491
Pootie knows what to do.

21:28.634 --> 21:30.932
This is gonna be good.

21:33.572 --> 21:36.871
l'll play back the levels
the way you set them.

21:37.009 --> 21:40.410
No instruments, no vocals, no levels.
Everything silent.

21:40.546 --> 21:42.104
Set it on me. Bleed.

22:02.768 --> 22:06.465
Pootie don't need no words,
don't even need no music.

22:21.387 --> 22:23.912
We have got a hit, baby.

22:24.056 --> 22:28.925
l like it, everybody seems to like it.
Now something you'll all like.

22:29.061 --> 22:31.894
We got the world premiere
from Pootie Tang

22:32.031 --> 22:35.000
and you know it'll be
out of this world.

22:35.134 --> 22:39.798
You all loved his last record,
''Sine Your Pitty On The Runny Kine''.

22:39.938 --> 22:42.429
You're all gonna love this new one.

22:42.574 --> 22:44.940
The new one is called...

22:45.077 --> 22:50.071
So let's listen up to the new record
by Pootie Tang, called...

22:50.215 --> 22:52.877
from Pootie Tang.

23:23.115 --> 23:28.052
Damn, this is good.
This is good. Pootie did it again.

23:28.220 --> 23:30.313
Pootie too good.

23:37.730 --> 23:40.096
Turn that noise down, dammit!

23:46.939 --> 23:49.840
Legendary Pootie Tang
has done it again,

23:49.975 --> 23:53.035
with his new song entitled...

23:53.178 --> 23:57.114
...already considered
one of the greatest hits of all time.

23:57.249 --> 24:01.777
This was the scene earlier today, as
fans mobbed Pootie Tang in the street.

24:01.920 --> 24:06.050
Many said they hadn't heard an artist
this profound since Al B Sure.

24:14.633 --> 24:16.897
Pootie was blowing up now.

24:17.035 --> 24:19.902
We're talking big.
l mean Macarena big.

24:20.038 --> 24:26.273
We're talking Electric Slide big.
Bentleys and girls in bikini thongs big.

24:26.411 --> 24:29.778
Everybody want a piece of Pootie.
You think l'm playing?

24:48.734 --> 24:50.793
Wait a minute.

24:50.936 --> 24:53.837
We got Pootie Tang
in the house tonight.

24:56.241 --> 25:00.735
Come on, Pootie.
l need you to sing a song with me.

25:03.816 --> 25:06.148
l love you, Pootie Tang.

25:06.285 --> 25:10.415
That's a bata shane,
my tellie. Wa-da-tah.

26:22.828 --> 26:25.296
Pootie Tang was with us here tonight.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.763
Pootie Tang!

27:03.735 --> 27:07.637
l love you, l want you.
l want to be with you.

27:07.806 --> 27:10.206
Pootie, please, please...

27:19.551 --> 27:22.179
l want you, l love you Pootie...

27:43.342 --> 27:46.573
Don't leave me out here
on my lonesome.

27:47.980 --> 27:50.107
Give a girl something!

27:51.316 --> 27:53.250
lt's not right.

28:16.475 --> 28:21.174
She's fine! Why did Pootie
pass that up? Cos she's crazy.

28:21.279 --> 28:23.247
She's licking milk out of a bowl.

28:33.158 --> 28:37.026
- Biggie Shorty.
- Pootie Tang! All right!

28:37.162 --> 28:39.960
Bata shane, my dillie?

28:40.098 --> 28:41.998
Same as always, baby.

28:42.134 --> 28:47.766
You come back tomorrow,
we gonna have a party.

28:47.906 --> 28:51.171
Talk about all the sisters and me.

28:51.309 --> 28:54.676
- You gonna be there?
- Wa-da-tah!

28:54.813 --> 28:56.713
All right, Pootie!

29:11.263 --> 29:12.787
Hey, young boys!

29:13.398 --> 29:16.390
Hey! Look at her!

29:16.535 --> 29:19.197
She's a lady!

29:20.872 --> 29:23.568
Oh, man, pull up!

29:40.125 --> 29:42.491
What do you want?

29:46.765 --> 29:50.565
- You want something?
- Yeah, baby, l want it.

29:50.702 --> 29:52.670
What do you want?

29:52.804 --> 29:57.002
How about the two of us?
How much?

30:01.012 --> 30:03.105
What's your problem?

30:03.215 --> 30:05.206
Just cos a girl dresses fancy

30:05.317 --> 30:08.013
and stands on street corners
near some whores,

30:08.153 --> 30:11.122
- you think she's hooking?
- Wouldn't you?

30:12.591 --> 30:16.687
No, l wouldn't.
l'm a lady, you greasy bastard.

30:24.970 --> 30:28.804
Ah, yeah! Pootie Tang
and the boys are here.

30:40.085 --> 30:43.418
Yo, man, a Biggie Shorty party
is exclusive.

30:43.555 --> 30:47.719
They don't let nobody in.
They got to line around the block.

30:47.859 --> 30:52.626
You know what? Nobody we know
could get in this party.

30:52.764 --> 30:56.860
They don't let no light in,
no electricity, no water.

30:56.968 --> 30:58.629
They don't let air in.

30:58.770 --> 31:02.501
Air is right now going,
''Hey, l'm air. l'm on the list''.

31:02.641 --> 31:06.008
And they won't let air in.
Air gets in everywhere.

31:06.178 --> 31:09.204
That's how exclusive
a Biggie Shorty party is.

31:09.347 --> 31:12.874
Hey, you know what else?
lt's hard to get in too.

31:15.053 --> 31:16.782
l hate you!

31:36.775 --> 31:40.108
Pretty girl. Pretty girl!

31:40.879 --> 31:42.870
Pretty girl out there!

31:44.382 --> 31:50.252
Pootie, you are the sexiest bastard
on God's green earth.

31:50.388 --> 31:51.548
Yeah.

31:51.690 --> 31:56.252
l tell you though, someday, l'm gonna
get a piece of you for myself.

31:56.394 --> 31:59.921
- Sepatown.
- Sepatown, my ass!

32:00.065 --> 32:03.000
You gonna be inside a bed
with me someday.

32:03.134 --> 32:07.434
You mark my words,
you skinny wonderful man.

32:09.107 --> 32:12.372
Pretty girl. Pretty girl?

32:13.545 --> 32:14.773
Sexy!

32:16.648 --> 32:18.013
Pretty girl?

32:18.149 --> 32:19.707
Pretty girl!

32:19.851 --> 32:22.843
How does a woman
get to you anyway?

32:22.988 --> 32:29.223
lt's like a state secret.
How to be with Pootie Tang.

32:30.395 --> 32:34.525
All right, get off him.
He don't want none of your mess.

32:39.204 --> 32:41.104
l tell you what, Pootie.

32:41.239 --> 32:45.141
Someday, you gonna meet
your match in a woman.

32:45.277 --> 32:50.078
Some day you gonna meet
the Darth Vader of T and A.

32:50.215 --> 32:54.709
Some woman's gonna kick your ass
and love you to death.

32:54.853 --> 32:57.515
And you gonna be in the dumps,

32:57.622 --> 33:00.557
banged to death
by the dark side of love.

33:01.793 --> 33:04.023
And on that day, Pootie,

33:05.030 --> 33:07.021
l'm gonna be there.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.766
And l'm gonna make
sweet love to you.

33:14.306 --> 33:15.796
Sexy girl!

33:15.940 --> 33:17.601
- Damn, man.
- Oh, l'm sorry.

33:17.742 --> 33:20.302
l thought you were
somebody else, man.

33:20.445 --> 33:22.072
Sorry, man.

33:23.181 --> 33:24.409
Sorry!

33:27.519 --> 33:29.680
l didn't get your name, did l?

33:32.524 --> 33:34.685
Damn, do l know you?

33:35.160 --> 33:37.594
Do you want me to pull your legs off?

33:37.729 --> 33:38.718
Pardon me?

33:38.863 --> 33:40.262
Wanna make out?

33:40.398 --> 33:45.597
l might enjoy that.
l just might enjoy that.

33:45.737 --> 33:48.399
You know, l just might enjoy that.

33:58.783 --> 34:02.014
O.K., wait a minute...
Wait a minute!

34:02.153 --> 34:05.884
Call me a sissy,
but you need to stop.

34:06.024 --> 34:09.016
You're tearing me apart,
you're killing me.

34:09.159 --> 34:12.152
- You want me to stop?
- Well, yes l do.

34:12.297 --> 34:14.891
O.K., then tell me something.

34:15.033 --> 34:19.469
- What do you wanna know?
- What's Pootie's secret?

34:20.772 --> 34:22.637
l can't tell you that.

34:22.774 --> 34:25.902
l would never do anything
to hurt Pootie Tang.

34:26.043 --> 34:29.775
But like l said, lreenie knew
how to break a brother down.

34:29.914 --> 34:33.007
- l can't tell you that.
- You can't? All right.

34:38.857 --> 34:42.588
O.K., wait, l'll tell you,
l'll tell you.

34:42.726 --> 34:46.322
l'll tell you. lt's the belt.

34:46.464 --> 34:51.800
lt's magical. He can kick
anybody's ass with that damn belt.

34:57.942 --> 34:59.705
Freeze, sucker.

35:03.882 --> 35:09.047
Give me your money, you fancy pants
bastard or l'll stick this in you deep.

35:10.188 --> 35:12.019
Wa-da-tah, my damie.

35:12.190 --> 35:16.957
l'm not your damie.
Give me your cash. l know you got it.

35:19.197 --> 35:22.997
Hey, l told you to back off.

35:35.113 --> 35:36.876
Pootie, hey, Pootie.

35:37.015 --> 35:40.280
Pootie. The craziest thing
happened to me.

35:40.418 --> 35:43.478
l'm in the club...
Pootie look out!

35:44.155 --> 35:46.646
Bang, bang, bang!

36:00.238 --> 36:03.230
Pootie? Everything under control?

36:06.277 --> 36:09.974
Kayed a brother, di.
Kayed a brother, di!

36:11.282 --> 36:13.614
I'm a shamey day.

36:13.785 --> 36:16.845
I'm a shamey day!

36:18.890 --> 36:21.688
lt hurts Pootie to kill a man.

36:21.826 --> 36:24.158
But he knows he's got to do it.

36:24.295 --> 36:28.197
But it hurts him so bad
to right those wrongs.

36:29.200 --> 36:31.168
My man, Pootie Tang.

36:40.044 --> 36:45.209
Come back on the bettie tai!
Come back on the bettie tai!

36:45.350 --> 36:48.285
Come back on the bettie tai!

36:53.124 --> 36:55.115
Pootie Tang?

36:56.394 --> 36:58.089
All right, my damie.

36:59.764 --> 37:03.393
Why didn't Trucky tell Pootie
he told lreenie all his business?

37:03.568 --> 37:05.160
Just running his mouth.

37:05.270 --> 37:09.434
When you see a man brought
back from the dead, you forget shit.

37:09.541 --> 37:12.135
Or maybe you're just a dumb ass.

37:19.384 --> 37:20.874
Stop the movie.

37:21.019 --> 37:23.419
Remember when Daddy Tang
told little Pootie,

37:23.555 --> 37:27.548
''Don't let the ladies come
between you and the belt''.

37:27.692 --> 37:31.856
Daddy Tang forgot to tell Pootie
about his only weakness...

37:31.996 --> 37:36.490
...hoes. Even Pootie Tang's belt
was no match for lreenie.

37:36.634 --> 37:40.434
You can't beat a hoe with a belt.
They like that shit.

37:53.718 --> 37:58.280
l'm sorry.
Did my cart hit your cart?

38:00.258 --> 38:02.726
l'm so sorry about that.

38:10.401 --> 38:12.733
Did l hurt you?

38:14.205 --> 38:15.866
What a drag.

38:16.507 --> 38:21.001
Again, l am very...sorry.

38:46.971 --> 38:51.101
Will you do something for me?

38:55.947 --> 38:58.643
Sign your pretty name.

39:06.090 --> 39:09.184
Sign it...sign it.

39:19.404 --> 39:21.269
He's signed it.

39:28.146 --> 39:30.011
He's signed it.

39:30.148 --> 39:32.207
He's signed it.

39:32.350 --> 39:34.580
He signed it?

39:34.719 --> 39:37.347
Nice job, lreenie.

39:37.488 --> 39:39.854
You're a damn genius, baby.

39:40.925 --> 39:43.257
''l, Pootie Tang,
surrender to Lecter Corp.

39:43.361 --> 39:45.955
''all rights to my image and likeness.

39:46.097 --> 39:50.431
''l will wholeheartedly endorse
all Lecter Corp. products

39:50.601 --> 39:53.001
''and will do my best to convince
the children of the world

39:53.137 --> 39:55.628
''the above-mentioned
are all clean, safe

39:55.740 --> 39:57.605
''and should be used by all of them.''

39:58.810 --> 40:01.643
Not the tipi tais, no!

40:01.779 --> 40:04.839
You are part of the corporation
just like us.

40:04.982 --> 40:11.114
Thought you could stay out of it?
Welcome aboard, Pootie Tang.

40:12.824 --> 40:15.054
Are you looking
for something, my friend?

40:16.060 --> 40:18.620
l've got it all, now.

40:19.697 --> 40:21.358
Shocking news today

40:21.466 --> 40:25.527
as Pootie Tang endorses
several controversial products

40:25.636 --> 40:28.833
for Lecter Corp.,
the infamous giant corporation.

40:28.973 --> 40:31.498
Something on the TV
about Pootie Tang.

40:31.676 --> 40:34.236
Man, my kids looked up to him.

40:34.378 --> 40:37.905
They don't even look at Dad
like they looked at him.

40:38.049 --> 40:42.452
But since he crossed, my little man
came up to me the other day

40:42.587 --> 40:46.751
and was like,
''How can he do that bullshit, man?''

40:56.667 --> 41:01.001
Pootie Tang has made my children
cry. l'll not support him anymore.

41:01.139 --> 41:07.567
Lecter Corp. effectively owns the name
Pootie Tang, his image and copyright.

41:07.745 --> 41:13.012
Pootie Tang has agreed to do several
commercials endorsing our sneakers,

41:13.151 --> 41:17.520
food products, cigarettes, whisky,
mace, switchblades, rat poison...

41:20.792 --> 41:23.989
- Pootie!
- Oh, no.

41:25.596 --> 41:31.694
l always had a high opinion of Pootie
Tang, but the way things are going,

41:31.836 --> 41:35.397
not only is he sold out,
he's scraping the bottom of the barrel.

41:35.540 --> 41:38.475
He was drugged by that crazy lreenie.

41:38.576 --> 41:40.544
Haven't you been watching the movie?

41:40.645 --> 41:42.704
That's what disturbs me.

41:42.880 --> 41:47.214
He's telling kids not to go to school,
to eat fast food, to do drugs.

41:47.351 --> 41:50.718
This is not the Pootie Tang
l used to know and admire.

41:50.855 --> 41:53.483
He would never tell kids
stuff like that.

41:53.658 --> 41:56.821
You're in denial.
He's doing dirt to his own reputation.

41:56.961 --> 42:00.556
- You don't know Pootie Tang.
- l don't know Pootie Tang?

42:00.698 --> 42:04.634
l know Pootie Tang and this isn't
the Pootie Tang l thought l knew.

42:04.769 --> 42:10.002
l thought a man of your stature would
have better sense than to fall for that.

42:11.943 --> 42:14.776
Look, this is all falling apart.

42:14.912 --> 42:18.871
The man used to be admired
by people of all walks of life.

42:18.983 --> 42:24.421
lf the world is gonna fall
for this mess about my Pootie Tang,

42:24.555 --> 42:26.989
then maybe the world
don't deserve him.

42:27.124 --> 42:30.719
What do you think Pootie Tang
needs at this point in his life?

42:30.862 --> 42:35.822
He just needs some of my good loving,
and he will be all right.

42:35.967 --> 42:38.026
- You watch.
- l hope you're right.

42:38.169 --> 42:40.228
- l know l am.
- We'll see.

42:40.371 --> 42:42.464
- We'll see.
- That's right.

42:42.607 --> 42:44.598
- Watch.
- l will.

42:56.354 --> 42:58.652
Pootie Tang was messed up.

42:58.789 --> 43:01.019
- Punk bitch!
- Sell out!

43:03.227 --> 43:04.956
Look at him.

43:05.096 --> 43:07.360
- Get a job, you bum.
- Get it together!

43:07.498 --> 43:10.433
Pootie looked like
someone who did it and ran.

43:10.568 --> 43:13.093
Pootie turned to the only woman
who could help him,

43:13.237 --> 43:15.068
Biggie Shorty.

43:23.581 --> 43:25.014
Pootie!

43:27.585 --> 43:32.420
- Pootie! Poor Pootie Tang.
- Tipi tais.

43:34.258 --> 43:39.924
That's all right.
Mama's got you. lt's all right.

43:42.266 --> 43:44.791
Biggie Shorty's
gonna take care of you.

43:44.969 --> 43:47.199
Don't you worry.

43:47.338 --> 43:50.330
Gonna have sex with you too,
you know.

43:50.474 --> 43:52.305
Finally.

43:59.617 --> 44:02.085
Are you sure you gotta go, Pootie?

44:02.219 --> 44:03.584
Yeah.

44:03.721 --> 44:05.882
That's a damn shame.

44:06.557 --> 44:09.458
You're the best piece of man
l ever had.

44:09.593 --> 44:15.259
You could stay here and live between
my bosoms for the rest of your life.

44:16.334 --> 44:19.030
Pootie got to flittie tai.

44:20.304 --> 44:23.000
Man's got to do, l suppose.

44:23.140 --> 44:27.270
l guess whilst you're gone, they can't
make you do more commercials.

44:27.411 --> 44:30.039
Where you gonna go?

44:30.181 --> 44:32.081
l tell you what.

44:32.216 --> 44:35.242
l got a little farmhouse
outside Greenville.

44:35.386 --> 44:38.913
lt was my mama's.
lt ain't much but nobody's living there.

44:39.056 --> 44:43.390
You go out there,
find yourself, blah, blah, blah.

44:43.561 --> 44:45.791
Then you come back to me, O.K.?

44:45.896 --> 44:48.228
That's a fine tine, baby.

44:48.332 --> 44:53.065
Give me some of that bony ass
one more time before you hit the road.

45:00.745 --> 45:04.203
Man, l hate prison.
Prison sucks.

45:05.816 --> 45:08.148
l reckon it's supposed to.

45:09.186 --> 45:11.552
You got something for me?

45:21.599 --> 45:25.228
This is fine dirt, man, good dirt.

45:26.203 --> 45:28.262
l'm gonna hook you up.

45:28.439 --> 45:32.500
l hate these bastards.
They make me shower every day.

45:33.644 --> 45:38.013
They never let me get dirty.
l'm Dirty Dee, dammit!

45:38.716 --> 45:42.277
Dirty Dee,
you gonna be dirty again soon.

45:43.220 --> 45:44.585
l promise.

45:45.356 --> 45:48.723
lt's that Pootie Tang.
He got to be stopped.

45:48.859 --> 45:51.794
l'm the one that's gonna stop him.

45:51.962 --> 45:54.863
Pootie damn Tang!

46:00.771 --> 46:02.204
Pootie!

46:04.375 --> 46:08.744
Pootie was headed to the farm
l wanted to go with him.

46:08.879 --> 46:10.972
Because it was all my fault.

46:11.115 --> 46:14.016
Everything that happened,
it's all my fault.

46:14.151 --> 46:19.088
l told that bitch all these things
and she just used it against him.

46:20.925 --> 46:25.658
l was sorry.
lt was killing me.

46:25.796 --> 46:28.424
l only did it for the ass.

46:30.167 --> 46:32.226
That deri-teri was all the dinie.

46:33.104 --> 46:37.165
l felt like he'd saved my life.

46:37.308 --> 46:39.833
And l'd messed his all up.

46:40.578 --> 46:43.479
l wanted him to forgive me.

46:46.050 --> 46:49.611
Trucky, you my main damie, man.

46:52.790 --> 46:55.452
Ain't no bad tammies between us.

46:55.593 --> 46:57.857
l wondered if he meant it.

46:57.995 --> 46:59.895
I'm a baino denie.

47:00.030 --> 47:03.124
l wanted to go to the farm with him.

47:03.267 --> 47:05.531
Wa-da-tah!

47:06.070 --> 47:08.937
All right, me and Pootie
going to the farm!

47:10.774 --> 47:14.175
l'm looking forward to this farm life.
Enough of the city.

47:15.880 --> 47:19.145
This is just what we need, Pootie.

47:19.783 --> 47:21.774
Live off the fat of the land,

47:21.919 --> 47:26.219
work hard, farming,
farming, farming.

47:26.357 --> 47:29.224
l can't wait, man. l cannot wait.

47:29.360 --> 47:31.351
l'm gonna milk that cow.

47:33.130 --> 47:38.090
All that milk, two per cent fat free,
skimmed milk.

47:38.235 --> 47:41.033
All that milk. Chocolate milk.

47:41.172 --> 47:46.838
l don't need no television,
cappuccino, partying all night long.

47:46.977 --> 47:49.571
l'm gonna put blisters on my hands.

47:49.713 --> 47:52.614
Sweat on my back.
That's what l want.

47:58.722 --> 47:59.916
Shit!

48:00.891 --> 48:03.121
Oh man, my pants.

48:03.260 --> 48:07.253
My damn pants.
Farming, farming, farming.

48:18.943 --> 48:22.037
This is not the thing, man.
This ain't cool.

48:22.179 --> 48:27.139
Dirty shoes, dirty pants,
dirty shirt, stinky.

48:27.284 --> 48:31.778
lt's hotter than a camel's hump here,
mosquitoes all over my shirt.

48:31.922 --> 48:35.153
l can't do it, man.
Whose dog is following me around?

48:35.292 --> 48:38.989
Whose dog is that?
Could be anybody's dog.

49:00.951 --> 49:05.251
l didn't want to leave Pootie,
but l couldn't do that survivor shit.

49:05.389 --> 49:08.415
l'll back my ass,
l need conveniences, man.

49:08.559 --> 49:11.926
On the other hand,
Pootie was loving every minute of it.

49:12.096 --> 49:15.827
He was rejuvenated.
Rejuvenated.

49:16.000 --> 49:19.936
He was juvenated before,
lost it and got juvenated again.

49:34.018 --> 49:36.987
And when Pootie planted
his first corn stalk...

49:37.121 --> 49:38.349
Damie.

49:38.522 --> 49:40.080
...he was happy.

49:40.224 --> 49:42.215
Too damn happy, if you ask me.

49:42.393 --> 49:43.621
lt was just corn.

49:48.332 --> 49:52.462
lt was just what he needed
to take his mind off his troubles.

49:52.603 --> 49:55.663
Rown on the crowny town.

49:58.809 --> 50:00.071
Morning.

50:04.248 --> 50:07.376
- Hi, Daddy.
- Not now, Stacy, honey.

50:07.518 --> 50:09.884
There's a new fella in town.
He's coming in here in a minute.

50:11.188 --> 50:15.420
- So?
- Maybe you can marry him.

50:15.592 --> 50:17.457
Daddy!

50:18.662 --> 50:22.029
Cut that shit out, Stacy.

50:22.166 --> 50:23.724
Here he comes.

50:25.469 --> 50:26.902
Hi, there.

50:27.037 --> 50:29.665
You got your can filled all right?

50:32.609 --> 50:35.544
This is my daughter, Stacy.

50:42.252 --> 50:44.550
Dillie on...

50:45.656 --> 50:47.817
...my damie.

50:53.397 --> 50:55.695
She's a looker, ain't she?

51:11.115 --> 51:12.980
Dirty Dee!

51:13.550 --> 51:15.484
God, you stink!

51:16.520 --> 51:18.044
Thank you.

51:18.188 --> 51:23.490
- l want to talk about Pootie Tang.
- Public enemy number one.

51:28.966 --> 51:31.901
We learned that anything
can be addictive.

51:32.035 --> 51:35.527
We pumped our burgers
so full of MSD

51:35.739 --> 51:39.402
people can't even taste
real food anymore.

51:39.576 --> 51:43.512
Today American kids don't eat
because they're hungry.

51:43.647 --> 51:48.050
They eat because they've just got
to have another Lecter burger.

51:49.653 --> 51:55.319
l own Pootie's name. l don't need him
to sell my products anymore.

51:55.459 --> 51:58.553
l've got thousands
of them all over the country.

51:58.695 --> 52:03.223
l'm just gonna give them the clothes
and this training tape.

52:04.435 --> 52:07.370
Remember, when making
a public appearance

52:07.504 --> 52:10.496
Pootie Tang always struts like this.

52:15.446 --> 52:20.611
Next week we're opening a brand new
nationwide chain of burger stands.

52:24.154 --> 52:27.248
Pootie's Bad Time Burgers.

52:27.424 --> 52:32.794
ln fact, the only thing that could mess
it up is if the real Pootie showed up.

52:32.930 --> 52:35.490
But that ain't good enough.

52:37.201 --> 52:39.465
l want him dead.

52:39.603 --> 52:44.199
l'd like to put that bitch in the ground
myself, but l ain't magical.

52:44.341 --> 52:46.832
l've been trying
to get Pootie for years.

52:47.010 --> 52:49.945
He's offed all my boys.
All l got left is Froggy.

52:50.080 --> 52:52.947
Nobody knows where Pootie is.

52:53.083 --> 52:55.483
l know where he is.

52:55.619 --> 53:00.318
l got people everywhere. Nobody can
hide from Corporate America.

53:01.425 --> 53:03.825
And as far as how to beat him...

53:06.029 --> 53:08.793
Maybe this will help.

53:11.201 --> 53:12.862
Hello.

53:15.372 --> 53:19.035
Remember her?
That's Stacy, the sheriff's daughter.

53:19.209 --> 53:23.509
He's been trying to get her married
since she was 12 years old.

53:23.647 --> 53:26.514
Hello, is anybody here?

53:35.792 --> 53:37.487
l'm sorry, l...

53:40.531 --> 53:43.625
l made you a pie.

53:50.240 --> 53:52.640
Do you want the pie?

53:57.447 --> 54:01.383
l know l'm not a pretty girl or...

54:04.755 --> 54:06.552
...or sexy.

54:08.425 --> 54:10.586
You'd probably like a...

54:11.762 --> 54:13.559
...sexy girl, right?

54:30.447 --> 54:31.709
Baby...

54:32.716 --> 54:36.618
...I'm gonna sine your pitty
on the runny kine.

54:49.333 --> 54:53.463
That's what makes Pootie Tang
a real hero.

54:53.604 --> 54:56.266
He can't see a woman
not loving herself.

54:56.406 --> 54:58.397
He's gonna put the love in.

54:58.542 --> 55:01.568
l say just give her a compliment.

55:01.745 --> 55:04.942
l like your shoes.
Have you been working out?

55:05.082 --> 55:07.642
What you doing with your hair?

55:07.784 --> 55:09.877
But l tell you what.

55:10.787 --> 55:14.279
l'm only gonna buy this hero shit,
so many times.

55:16.326 --> 55:19.762
Meanwhile, back in the city,
all hell was breaking loose.

55:19.896 --> 55:22.228
l'm talking about drug dealing,
drug using,

55:22.366 --> 55:25.233
booty shaking, too much damn TV,

55:25.369 --> 55:28.964
drinking, people eating too much
and getting fat,

55:29.139 --> 55:32.768
fighting, kids out of school,
ain't nobody reading.

55:32.943 --> 55:35.275
People acting straight damn fools.

55:35.412 --> 55:39.405
And Corporate America was loving it.
Look at them, it's a party.

55:39.549 --> 55:45.715
Since he left, everything just went
bonkers. Everybody lost their mind.

55:45.856 --> 55:48.017
Pootie Tang, you shouldn't do this.

55:48.291 --> 55:51.055
Come back to the city
where you belong.

55:55.632 --> 55:57.964
Back on the farm,
the worst happened.

55:58.068 --> 56:00.434
Pootie Tang's corn stalk died.

56:00.570 --> 56:05.633
For the third time in his life, Pootie
lost the only important thing to him.

56:05.776 --> 56:10.076
First his family, then his belt,
and now his corn died.

56:10.714 --> 56:13.410
Farm life was driving Pootie crazy.

56:13.550 --> 56:15.609
He must have lost his damn mind.

56:15.752 --> 56:19.051
He's down on his knees
crying over a piece of corn.

56:19.189 --> 56:22.090
Not even popcorn, regular damn corn.

56:22.225 --> 56:26.753
Pootie Tang had lost hope. lt would
take a miracle to bring him back.

56:29.700 --> 56:31.031
Pootie.

56:32.536 --> 56:34.060
Pootie Tang.

56:44.915 --> 56:46.815
Up here, Pootie.

57:04.334 --> 57:06.234
Hey, watch the leaves.

57:09.773 --> 57:10.967
Daddy?

57:11.108 --> 57:13.133
Damn right l'm your Daddy.

57:13.276 --> 57:16.268
What you doing running away
from your problems?

57:16.480 --> 57:18.675
Did l teach you like that?

57:18.815 --> 57:20.544
Don't mumble, boy.

57:20.684 --> 57:22.618
Pootie, my boy?

57:23.120 --> 57:24.553
Mama Di.

57:24.688 --> 57:28.784
Pootie, you're a good man.
l'm proud of you.

57:28.925 --> 57:33.555
You have so much love in you.
You can give it like a gift.

57:33.697 --> 57:37.656
Your father was wrong to tell you
to guard it like a secret.

57:37.801 --> 57:39.268
What was that?

57:39.402 --> 57:42.394
- Shut your mouth.
- Hey, woman.

57:42.539 --> 57:44.837
You corn ass fool.

57:46.510 --> 57:50.207
Pootie, teach the world
right from wrong,

57:50.347 --> 57:55.444
but love the world at the same time.
That's the key.

57:55.619 --> 57:57.314
Where's your belt, boy?

57:57.521 --> 58:03.323
You let the ladies get your belt?
l knew that would happen.

58:03.460 --> 58:05.724
Now you lost all your confidence.

58:05.862 --> 58:09.161
l'm here to tell you
there's nothing special about that belt.

58:09.299 --> 58:11.790
l bought it a Piggly Wiggly
for 95 cents.

58:11.935 --> 58:16.338
You don't need that belt, cos you got
the goodness in your heart.

58:16.473 --> 58:20.637
Now go out there and take that
and kick some ass.

58:21.578 --> 58:23.068
Don't mumble, boy.

58:23.213 --> 58:28.879
Now go out there, take that goodness,
and teach the world right from wrong.

58:55.812 --> 58:59.304
l think maybe you and me
got something to talk about.

59:01.751 --> 59:08.589
l understand you and...Stacy there...
got to know each other.

59:15.932 --> 59:18.958
Had yourself a little time?

59:23.573 --> 59:24.801
Yeah!

59:28.879 --> 59:30.369
That's terrific!

59:33.783 --> 59:35.978
When's the wedding?

59:41.358 --> 59:47.388
Like l say, l sure would be mighty
proud to have you for a son-in-law.

01:00:03.346 --> 01:00:05.473
What the hell?

01:00:21.765 --> 01:00:23.198
Pootie Tang!

01:00:24.234 --> 01:00:26.930
Pootie Tang!

01:00:28.672 --> 01:00:30.867
What you doing way out here?

01:00:31.007 --> 01:00:33.532
You know these guys?

01:00:34.344 --> 01:00:39.748
l've come to call you out,
maggot eating bitch.

01:00:39.883 --> 01:00:44.650
You ain't come one,
but many tine tanies.

01:00:45.755 --> 01:00:50.055
l gets by with a little help
from my friends.

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:54.858
Now, listen here, fellas.
We don't want no trouble here.

01:00:54.998 --> 01:00:58.058
Why don't you just move on through?

01:00:58.668 --> 01:01:02.104
- What's up, papa-in-law?
- Back off there.

01:01:02.238 --> 01:01:04.604
l'm sheriff of this town.

01:01:04.741 --> 01:01:09.235
Hold up, hold up! Rewind that.
Let me see that one more time.

01:01:09.379 --> 01:01:11.677
l'm sheriff of this town.

01:01:11.848 --> 01:01:14.009
That had to hurt his ass.

01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:16.015
l know he's embarrassed.

01:01:16.152 --> 01:01:18.120
Slap him like a bitch.

01:01:20.924 --> 01:01:25.987
He shouldn't have messed
around and got Pootie Tang mad.

01:01:28.131 --> 01:01:31.430
Question: where you think you going?

01:01:31.568 --> 01:01:33.798
Wait! Hold up Pootie.

01:01:37.474 --> 01:01:39.442
Capa-town, my ass.

01:01:41.044 --> 01:01:43.535
You're not so bad now are you?

01:02:57.654 --> 01:03:01.613
Guess you...slapped him like a bitch.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.060
Yeah.

01:03:06.196 --> 01:03:07.663
Now...

01:03:10.033 --> 01:03:11.500
like l was saying.

01:03:28.418 --> 01:03:30.886
l was searching for Pootie
high and low.

01:03:30.987 --> 01:03:33.319
Then l remembered
he was at the farm.

01:03:33.523 --> 01:03:38.927
All this time l'd been talking about the
farm, how did l forget he was there?

01:03:39.062 --> 01:03:41.724
l got there just in time.

01:03:41.865 --> 01:03:46.825
- Pootie, come back right now.
- What's the dabble, di?

01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:49.666
There's a wedding going on here.

01:03:49.806 --> 01:03:54.800
They're making you sell products,
even when you're not there!

01:03:54.978 --> 01:04:00.644
l'm talking about cigarettes.
And look, Pootie Tang malt liquor.

01:04:00.817 --> 01:04:04.685
They got all these Pootie-a-likes
hawking all this shit.

01:04:04.821 --> 01:04:06.948
And everybody thinks it's you.

01:04:07.090 --> 01:04:10.787
Come back to the city,
so everybody knows the truth.

01:04:10.927 --> 01:04:12.292
Come on.

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.899
All right, Pootie Tang.

01:04:32.182 --> 01:04:34.207
l ain't the marrying type.

01:04:34.350 --> 01:04:38.912
l don't make my bed,
l leave the toilet seat up...

01:04:39.055 --> 01:04:42.821
But she is a lovely lady, though.

01:04:53.169 --> 01:04:57.105
Pootie Tang and l are thrilled
to be opening this,

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:03.201
the first Pootie Tang Bad Time
Burger restaurant, right Pootie?

01:05:03.346 --> 01:05:05.974
Sa da tay!

01:05:06.082 --> 01:05:08.642
Sa da tay. Got that?

01:05:09.586 --> 01:05:13.215
That ain't Pootie Tang.
That's Doodie Tang.

01:05:13.356 --> 01:05:17.292
That ain't Pootie Tang either.

01:05:17.427 --> 01:05:22.797
l know that ain't Pootie Tang.
l just said it's Doodie Tang.

01:05:22.932 --> 01:05:24.422
Shut up!

01:05:24.567 --> 01:05:28.025
Sepatown, tipi tais.

01:05:28.171 --> 01:05:30.662
Yo sepatown, tipi tais.

01:05:34.377 --> 01:05:35.810
Christ.

01:05:35.945 --> 01:05:38.914
- That's Pootie Tang!
- Wa-da-tah.

01:05:39.048 --> 01:05:41.983
Don't pay attention to him.
That's nobody.

01:05:42.118 --> 01:05:44.211
This is Pootie Tang.

01:05:44.387 --> 01:05:47.220
Yes, l'm Pootie.

01:05:47.357 --> 01:05:50.918
Now, clap it up my hammies...

01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:54.757
...rinatine, my America.

01:05:54.864 --> 01:05:58.994
Coola may my...

01:06:03.606 --> 01:06:08.202
You think you've solved the problem?
Guess again.

01:06:13.683 --> 01:06:17.175
See, l got more Pooties than you do.

01:06:26.562 --> 01:06:29.053
You're not only late,
but you're outnumbered.

01:06:29.232 --> 01:06:35.102
By this time tomorrow, there will be
so many Pooties, you won't matter.

01:06:36.806 --> 01:06:41.243
He ain't alone, mister rich man.
l'm here too.

01:07:08.371 --> 01:07:10.862
Pootie! Pootie!

01:07:27.690 --> 01:07:29.783
You looking at my ass?

01:08:09.665 --> 01:08:12.725
You bastards ain't going any place.

01:08:18.808 --> 01:08:20.867
Bye-bye Bad Time.

01:08:29.419 --> 01:08:32.546
All right! l got him, Pootie.

01:08:34.791 --> 01:08:36.452
Capachow!

01:08:39.629 --> 01:08:41.654
Pootie Tang is back!

01:08:41.798 --> 01:08:43.788
Pootie Tang!

01:08:44.533 --> 01:08:49.971
- No, no Pootie.
- l got to say the nay no, my brother.

01:08:55.845 --> 01:08:57.971
What will you do now, Pootie?

01:08:58.113 --> 01:09:01.550
- We're gonna get married.
- Yeah.

01:09:02.785 --> 01:09:05.117
And that's the way it went down.

01:09:05.254 --> 01:09:08.381
Pootie Tang got his man,
and Biggie Shorty got hers

01:09:08.524 --> 01:09:11.515
but not before she handled
one piece of business.

01:09:20.102 --> 01:09:21.466
Oh, hi!

01:09:39.721 --> 01:09:42.247
Man, it is hot today.

01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:45.849
lt's hot out here.
lt is hot today.

01:09:46.162 --> 01:09:48.187
You know it's hot out.

01:09:50.633 --> 01:09:52.464
Yeah, l just said that.

01:09:52.602 --> 01:09:54.832
You know it's hot too.

01:09:56.506 --> 01:09:59.236
That's why l said it, man.
lt is hot out here.

01:09:59.375 --> 01:10:01.843
l know, l'm just saying it's hot too.

01:10:06.549 --> 01:10:09.313
And as for me, Trucky...

01:10:09.452 --> 01:10:11.443
Oh shit, the lasagna!

01:10:11.587 --> 01:10:15.887
Dammit Trucky, l can't believe
you burned that lasagna again.

01:10:22.932 --> 01:10:26.026
That is the longest movie clip
l've ever seen.

01:10:26.168 --> 01:10:28.136
Then you are Pootie Tang.

01:10:28.271 --> 01:10:30.296
Sa da tay!

01:10:30.473 --> 01:10:32.998
Exactly. Pootie Tang,

01:10:33.142 --> 01:10:35.337

01:10:35.444 --> 01:10:36.877
I dabe the sammie.

01:10:36.979 --> 01:10:39.880
Cole me on the panny sty.

01:10:41.217 --> 01:10:42.809
Sorry, what was that?

01:10:42.952 --> 01:10:47.048
Cole me on the panny sty.

01:10:47.189 --> 01:10:50.750
What the hell are you talking about?

01:10:54.997 --> 01:10:57.898
Cole me down on the panny sty?

01:10:58.034 --> 01:10:59.695
Oh, cole me down on the panny sty.

01:10:59.869 --> 01:11:02.804
All right.
Thank you, Pootie Tang.

01:11:07.343 --> 01:11:12.872
Pootie Tang,
Pootie Tang! l love it.

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.379
He's so sexy,
l love Pootie.

01:11:32.969 --> 01:11:33.993
Cut!

01:11:34.136 --> 01:11:36.331
Pootie Tang got three gold records.

01:11:36.472 --> 01:11:39.532
Pootie gets all the Grammies
because he's Pootie Tang.

01:11:39.675 --> 01:11:43.076
- He's terrific.
- l don't think he's so great.

01:11:50.152 --> 01:11:51.813
Pootie got you now.

01:11:53.222 --> 01:11:55.452
Pootie's about to make reservations
on you now.

01:11:55.591 --> 01:11:58.526
The red phone is blinking!

01:11:58.661 --> 01:12:01.357
lt's over for you now.
lt's over now for you.

01:12:01.497 --> 01:12:04.398
You know it's over.
He got you in the radar.

01:12:04.533 --> 01:12:08.560
Pootie got you now.
Red phone ringing.

01:12:12.908 --> 01:12:15.308
Man's got to do, l suppose.

01:12:15.444 --> 01:12:19.505
l guess whilst you're gone,
they can't make you do more movies.

01:12:19.649 --> 01:12:22.777
- No more movies!
- Do that line again.

01:12:22.918 --> 01:12:26.081
I'm gonna sine your pitty
on the runny kine.

01:12:49.945 --> 01:12:55.542
We don't like no trouble around here.
You know, quiet town.

01:12:58.554 --> 01:13:00.351
You look all right, though.

01:13:01.991 --> 01:13:04.459
A little weird, though, ain't you?

01:13:04.593 --> 01:13:07.221
That's my panny, di.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.763
l suppose so.

01:13:13.469 --> 01:13:17.405
Yeah, baby,
it's time to get dirty.

01:13:39.995 --> 01:13:43.431
l can't hear a word you're saying
because l got earplugs in.

01:13:43.566 --> 01:13:45.500
But l'm tired of talking.

01:13:47.436 --> 01:13:50.928
Everybody run away.
Run, run, run!

01:13:53.142 --> 01:13:54.803
Pootie stays.

01:14:40.189 --> 01:14:43.852
I'm gonna sine your kitty
on the sepatown.

01:15:31.774 --> 01:15:34.766
I'm gonna sine your pitty...

01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:39.040
...on the runny...kine.

01:15:40.015 --> 01:15:41.573
Pootie did it again.

01:21:02.237 --> 01:21:03.704
