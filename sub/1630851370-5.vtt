handle the meds,

07:31.276 --> 07:32.190
and I'll lower him
onto the butt bagel.

07:32.364 --> 07:33.931
Come on.[GRUNTING]

07:34.105 --> 07:36.325
[BARRY SIGHS]How's that?

07:36.499 --> 07:37.892
It's like floating
on freshly
fallen snow.

07:38.066 --> 07:39.328
How'd you do that?

07:39.502 --> 07:40.764
With my strongest
muscle. Compassion.

07:40.938 --> 07:43.114
[LAUGHS FORCEDLY] Hey.

07:43.288 --> 07:44.942
My first laugh
since I used
every leaf

07:45.116 --> 07:46.814
on that
uninviting bush.

07:46.988 --> 07:48.555
Thanks, Geoff.Here's baby's baba.

07:49.904 --> 07:51.688
[SLURPS] Gross.

07:51.862 --> 07:52.994
It tastes like medicine.

07:53.168 --> 07:54.125
I'm gonna make you
a new one, champ.

07:54.299 --> 07:56.606
Erica, I'm hungry,

07:56.780 --> 07:58.478
and I want
something delicious.

07:58.652 --> 08:01.481
There may be
a war raging in
the canyon below,

08:01.655 --> 08:04.005
but up in this valley,
I want to live
like a king.

08:04.179 --> 08:06.224
I'll get you a banana,
Your Majesty.

08:06.398 --> 08:08.357
Blech! I want hot wings.

08:08.531 --> 08:09.532
The hotter, the better.

08:09.706 --> 08:10.794
I don't care what
the doctor said.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.840
My mouth didn't sit
in poison ivy.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.406
Barry was a handful,

08:14.581 --> 08:16.060
but as the day
went on, things got...

08:16.234 --> 08:17.758
Well, not much better.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.499
The remote?

08:19.673 --> 08:21.283
There was his bath... BARRY: Aah!
The water is scalding!

08:21.457 --> 08:22.806
My secret garden
can't take this heat!

08:22.980 --> 08:24.155
Did you check
with your elbow?

08:24.329 --> 08:25.374
You gotta check
with the elbow.

08:25.548 --> 08:26.767
I'm coming in
eyes closed!

08:26.941 --> 08:28.682
His ointment time...

08:28.856 --> 08:30.292
You gave this
to Barry to rub
on his butt?

08:30.466 --> 08:32.076
It's his ointment.It's Dippity-do.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.338
What's the diff?
It seemed to work.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.210
BARRY: It did not.

08:35.384 --> 08:38.082
It is an area that
does not need
to be styled.

08:38.256 --> 08:39.867
And, finally, bedtime.

08:40.041 --> 08:41.999
[SIGHS] Okay,
he's finally down.

08:42.173 --> 08:43.871
Yippee.He wanted
a bedtime story,

08:44.045 --> 08:45.568
and he insisted
I make it
super graphic.

08:45.742 --> 08:47.004
It was very
uncomfortable.

08:47.178 --> 08:48.832
Well, I'm sure
the smile on his
dumb little face

08:49.006 --> 08:50.007
made it all worth it.

08:50.181 --> 08:51.574
Why are you so upset?

08:51.748 --> 08:52.880
I'm the one who's
doing most of the work.

08:53.054 --> 08:54.751
Oh, you love doing
most of the work.

08:54.925 --> 08:56.144
BARRY: Guys!

08:56.318 --> 08:58.189
I need help
to the bathroom!

08:58.363 --> 09:00.278
You know, 'cause
of my condition!

09:00.452 --> 09:02.367
Here's where
I prove you wrong.
You're up.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.369
How about no one's up?

09:04.544 --> 09:06.241
We can let
him cry it out
once in a while.

09:06.415 --> 09:07.895
Yeah, that's not
really my style.

09:08.069 --> 09:10.071
Yeah, which is why
he's worse and worse.

09:10.245 --> 09:12.421
I mean, you just
spun him an R-rated
goodnight yarn.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.336
BARRY: There's a
ticking clock on this!

09:14.510 --> 09:16.251
Okay, fine, I'll go.

09:16.425 --> 09:17.774
But tomorrow,
I have to be in lab,
so you're on call.

09:17.948 --> 09:19.210
Fine.

09:19.384 --> 09:20.995
But remember,
I have a cappella
practice.

09:21.169 --> 09:22.779
BARRY:
Yay! It's Geoff!

09:22.953 --> 09:24.738
He helps
without hurting.

09:24.912 --> 09:26.696
ADULT ADAM:
While Geoff was always
there for my brother,

09:26.870 --> 09:29.873
Mr. Glascott was
just[SIGHS]
always there.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.135
It's almost 5:00.

09:31.309 --> 09:32.920
Did you stay late
after school?

09:33.094 --> 09:36.140
Nope, we carpooled
and took the
scenic route home.

09:36.314 --> 09:38.403
I had a very
fascinating
dream last night,

09:38.578 --> 09:39.970
so I took a few
extra turns

09:40.144 --> 09:41.929
so that I could
tell Adam
all the details.

09:42.103 --> 09:43.887
We drove
to Paramus
and back.

09:44.061 --> 09:46.194
My brain is
very active
when I sleep.

09:46.368 --> 09:48.718
They say it's a sign
of genius. [CHUCKLES]
Or madness.

09:48.892 --> 09:50.590
But we know
which one, right?
[CHUCKLES]

09:50.764 --> 09:52.374
I'm pretty clear on it.

09:52.548 --> 09:54.289
Hey, is Murray in?

09:54.463 --> 09:56.421
Bill and I sort of
hogged the Zen
path yesterday,

09:56.596 --> 09:58.075
and I think he
may have felt
a little left out.

09:58.249 --> 09:59.424
You know,
instead of that,

10:01.688 --> 10:02.514
how would you
like to join
a book club?

10:02.689 --> 10:05.343
Ooh.

10:05.517 --> 10:06.649
I liked the plot
of this one.

10:06.823 --> 10:07.911
Me too.

10:08.085 --> 10:09.130
One thing happened,

10:09.304 --> 10:11.132
then another,
then another.

10:11.306 --> 10:12.960
And it kept
going that way
until the end.

10:13.134 --> 10:15.266
And how about
the description
of that lifeguard?

10:15.440 --> 10:17.617
I could almost smell
the suntan oil
on his abs.

10:17.791 --> 10:19.140
It's like
mouth-to-mouth,

10:19.314 --> 10:21.359
and then maybe
a little
body-to-body.

10:21.533 --> 10:22.578
Essie, did you
even read the book?

10:24.275 --> 10:25.581
I'm sorry?You should be.

10:25.755 --> 10:27.844
What terrible choice
did the lifeguard make?

10:28.018 --> 10:29.759
Ooh, I remember.

10:29.933 --> 10:32.632
He bought some
swimming trunks that
were way too small.

10:32.806 --> 10:34.764
[CHUCKLES]
[WHISPERING] Very tight.

10:34.938 --> 10:36.200
He watched a man
drown and did nothing.

10:37.854 --> 10:38.812
What's the point of
having a book club

10:38.986 --> 10:39.639
if you're not gonna
read the book?

10:39.813 --> 10:41.162
We usually have wine.

10:41.336 --> 10:42.642
Well, it's
a good thing
that I'm here.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.556
I'm gonna get
some pens
and some paper.

10:44.731 --> 10:47.690
To jot down our
grievances with your
tone and manner?

10:47.864 --> 10:49.997
No, so we can have
an in-class essay,

10:50.171 --> 10:52.434
and I want all
of your eyes
on your own paper.

10:52.608 --> 10:53.435
I'm looking
at you, Essie.

10:55.306 --> 10:56.917
I want to go home.

10:57.091 --> 10:59.267
Bevy, is John gonna
be at the big barbecue
this weekend?

10:59.441 --> 11:01.356
Lou and I might
come down with
a wet cough

11:01.530 --> 11:02.662
depending on
your answer.

11:02.836 --> 11:07.014
[ALL FAKE COUGHING]

11:07.188 --> 11:08.145
[WHISPERING] Glascott
will know nothing

11:08.319 --> 11:09.233
about the barbecue.

11:13.455 --> 11:14.935
ADULT ADAM:
Erica had been
taking care of Barry,

11:15.109 --> 11:16.632
but it was time
for her to go,

11:16.806 --> 11:18.808
and Geoff was
nowhere to be found.

11:18.982 --> 11:20.157
Do you really
have to lay
there like that,

11:20.331 --> 11:22.029
with your butt
hovering in the air?

11:22.203 --> 11:23.944
Well, ever since
you overinflated
my medical pillow,

11:24.118 --> 11:25.772
my options for
comfort are limited.

11:25.946 --> 11:27.208
[SIGHS] I never
thought I would miss
looking at your face.

11:27.382 --> 11:29.210
And there's a new issue.

11:29.384 --> 11:31.560
The pain is now an itch.
[GROANS]

11:31.734 --> 11:33.518
An itch like no other.You heard the doctor.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.172
Scratching will
prolong the healing,

11:35.346 --> 11:36.260
and nobody wants that.

11:36.434 --> 11:39.046
Just give me
a slotted spoon?

11:39.220 --> 11:41.613
A balloon whisk?
A seafood fork?

11:41.788 --> 11:43.615
A grapefruit spoon?
A melon baller?

11:43.790 --> 11:46.227
One of those little
things you hold
corn with? Anything!

11:46.401 --> 11:48.098
Ew! You're a little
too familiar with

11:48.272 --> 11:49.839
the scratching power
of our silverware.

11:50.013 --> 11:51.711
Wait, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

11:51.885 --> 11:53.190
I'm already late.

11:53.364 --> 11:54.714
Geoff was supposed
to be here an hour ago.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.411
You can't just
leave me
here like this!

11:56.585 --> 11:59.066
Watch me.Erica, please.

11:59.240 --> 12:00.850
You're the only thing
between me, my butt,

12:01.024 --> 12:01.633
and your
silverware drawer.

12:04.767 --> 12:07.814
I can't believe
Geoff flaked like this.[EXHALES]

12:07.988 --> 12:09.424

you doing?[SCOFFS] Nothing.

12:09.598 --> 12:10.991
I see your hips moving!

12:11.165 --> 12:12.427
You're wiggling to
itch your butt!

12:12.601 --> 12:14.168
Okay! I'm sitting
on a hairbrush.

12:15.125 --> 12:16.257
My hairbrush?

12:16.431 --> 12:17.649
It's not yours anymore.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.869
And I don't care if
it makes it worse.

12:20.043 --> 12:21.915
[SIGHING]
It's the devil's relief.

12:22.089 --> 12:24.091
Oh, my God.
Barry, you need
to distract yourself.

12:24.265 --> 12:25.135
Here, look at this!

12:25.309 --> 12:27.050
Whoa!

12:27.224 --> 12:29.139
It lights up.Mmm-hmm.

12:29.313 --> 12:31.272
And the mirror
makes my eye
look like a giraffe's!

know what else is fun?

Erica had her
first parenting win

12:39.323 --> 12:41.586
until she saw something that
would make her lose it.

12:43.458 --> 12:44.894
...walking out of

Yep, Geoff was
on thin ice.

12:47.288 --> 12:48.985
[SCHOOL BELL RINGS] And Mom was
hot on the trail

12:49.159 --> 12:50.987
of getting
Mr. Glascott
a new pal.

12:51.161 --> 12:52.728
Hey, neighbor!

12:52.902 --> 12:55.339
Look who's chatting up
well-known crank,
Mr. Woodburn.

12:55.513 --> 12:56.732
Yeah, I'm confused, too.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.212
She asked me
a question,
I responded,

12:58.386 --> 12:59.909
and it just kept going.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.911
Well, you know,
until today, I hadn't
taken the time

13:02.085 --> 13:04.653
to get to know Dale,
and I'm learning so much.

13:04.827 --> 13:07.264
Like, did you know
he made his own canoe?

13:07.438 --> 13:09.092
Ooh! For work or play?

13:09.266 --> 13:11.355
Strictly play.
Woodburn gets after it
on the weekends.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.923
[GASPS]
Here's a fun idea.

13:14.097 --> 13:16.143
John, do you remember
the other night when
I came home from work

13:16.317 --> 13:17.579
and you were
waiting for me
on my porch?

13:17.753 --> 13:19.886
Yes, I had made
a Cobb salad

13:20.060 --> 13:22.627
and had half
a head of lettuce
left over to share.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.891
No, the other night
when you wanted to
read me your bucket list.

13:25.065 --> 13:26.675
Oh, yes. I made
a few updates

13:26.849 --> 13:28.111
and wanted to
get her feedback.

13:28.285 --> 13:29.896
Wasn't "canoe trip"
on there?

13:30.070 --> 13:32.202
You had moved it
up from 18 to 16

13:32.376 --> 13:34.161
and then moved down
"try sushi."

13:34.335 --> 13:35.684
And that reminds me,

13:35.858 --> 13:37.642
I undercooked
some salmon and
ate it anyway.

13:37.817 --> 13:38.905
Do you think
that counts?No.

13:39.079 --> 13:40.602
Woodburn, aren't
you gonna take

13:40.776 --> 13:42.169
that canoe out
this weekend?

13:42.343 --> 13:44.084
Yeah, maiden voyage.
Where is this going?

13:44.258 --> 13:46.086
I'm just saying,
maybe you two should

13:46.260 --> 13:49.089
go canoeing together
on Saturday.

13:49.263 --> 13:50.264
Holy crap.

13:50.438 --> 13:52.135
Is my one-man watercraft

13:52.309 --> 13:53.876
becoming a
two-man watercraft?

for me to join you?

on the Delaware

13:57.793 --> 13:58.838

in the world

13:59.012 --> 14:00.361
and a lifetime of regret.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.058
That's got legs.

14:02.232 --> 14:03.843
Hmm. Okay, I guess.

a fast one on Glascott,

but my sister
wasn't going to let
Geoff do the same.

Hey, babe.
What's all this?

14:13.504 --> 14:14.941
My way of saying sorry.

14:15.115 --> 14:16.681
You've done
all the work
with Barry,

14:16.856 --> 14:18.205
and I've been no help.

14:18.379 --> 14:20.685
Other than today,
when you had to
be in the lab.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.818
About that,
I should have called,
but there was,

14:22.992 --> 14:24.472
uh, an explosion.

14:24.646 --> 14:26.126
Oh, no,
not in the lab

14:26.300 --> 14:28.041
where you
definitely were.

14:28.215 --> 14:30.173
Definitely. Yeah,
the chemicals went...

And everyone
was like "Aah!"
It was crazy.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.744
Well, things were
less eventful here.

14:35.918 --> 14:36.527
I just missed
a cappella practice.

14:37.833 --> 14:40.096
Oh, right.
Sorry about that.

14:40.270 --> 14:41.750
It's fine. They just
gave my solo

14:41.924 --> 14:43.099
to the girl with
the back brace.

14:43.273 --> 14:45.101
That sucks,
but she needed
the win.
