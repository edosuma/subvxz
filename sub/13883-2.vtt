01:07.280 --> 01:11.148
<i>Three million years from Earth,</i>
<i>the mining ship Red Dwarf.</i>

01:11.284 --> 01:14.617
<i>Its crew: Dave Lister,</i>
<i>the last human being alive, :</i>

01:14.755 --> 01:17.690
<i>Arnold Rimmer, a hologram</i>
<i>of his dead bunkmate, :</i>

01:17.824 --> 01:21.123
<i>And a creature who evolved</i>
<i>from the ship's cat. Message ends.</i>

01:23.597 --> 01:26.225
<i>Additional.</i>
<i>Loneliness weighs heavily on us all.</i>

01:26.366 --> 01:28.960
<i>Personally, the only thing that keeps me going</i>

01:29.102 --> 01:34.438
<i>is knowing that we are over 60 billion miles</i>
<i>from the nearest Berni Inn.</i>

01:41.548 --> 01:44.711
For a mild stomach upset, take one teaspoonful.

01:44.851 --> 01:48.150
For acute indigestion, take two.

01:52.592 --> 01:55.652
Well, a highly enjoyable meal all round.

01:55.796 --> 01:58.492
Obviously, you can't expect perfection first time,

01:58.632 --> 02:01.567
but I was quite delighted with my dumplings.

02:01.701 --> 02:05.068
Rimmer, real dumplings, proper dumplings,

02:05.205 --> 02:07.070
when they're properly cooked to perfection,

02:07.207 --> 02:10.904
proper dumplings should not bounce.

02:11.678 --> 02:15.512
True, but compared to what I thought
they'd be like, they were superb.

02:15.649 --> 02:20.814
- So, how's the Cat?
- He's sleeping off the stomach pump.

02:20.954 --> 02:23.354
He'll be all right. The lamb was a flop, though.

02:23.490 --> 02:27.586
The lamb? Everybody thought
the lamb was the cheese!

02:27.727 --> 02:30.287
And that lemon meringue pie, what was in that?

02:30.430 --> 02:35.493
- You liked that. You brought some back.
- Yeah, to try on my athlete's foot.

02:35.635 --> 02:39.093
It's not easy, Lister, cooking... when you're dead,

02:39.239 --> 02:42.140
you don't exist,
when you're made entirely of light.

02:42.442 --> 02:45.104
That's your excuse for everything, being dead.

02:45.245 --> 02:49.614
I'm trying to rehabilitate myself,
trying to do the everyday things

02:49.749 --> 02:51.614
that living people take for granted.

02:51.751 --> 02:56.484
- You've got the skutters to help you.
- What? Pinky and smegging Perky?

02:56.623 --> 03:00.081
What use are they?
It's like giving Blind Pew contact lenses.

03:00.227 --> 03:03.924
- They only do what you tell them to.
- They don't.

03:04.064 --> 03:08.899
You say, "Keep an eye on that lamb,"
and they watch it burn.

03:09.803 --> 03:13.705
They've got no emotion.
It's not built into their software.

03:13.840 --> 03:17.867
Their broom cupboard is full
of pin-ups of John Wayne.

03:18.011 --> 03:22.505
That's not right. Piled this high
with Film Fun magazines.

03:22.649 --> 03:24.549
That's not the way spanners behave.

03:24.684 --> 03:27.016
<i>Oi. What's happening, dudes?</i>

03:27.153 --> 03:28.780
- Hi, Hol.
- <i>Guess what?</i>

03:28.922 --> 03:31.356
- (BOTH) What?
- <i>Go on, guess.</i>

03:31.491 --> 03:34.892
- What is it vaguely about?
- <i>No clues, just guess.</i>

03:39.466 --> 03:41.195
<i>I knew you wouldn't get it.</i>

03:41.334 --> 03:43.859
- <i>The post pod's arrived.</i>
- The mail?!

03:44.004 --> 03:47.337
<i>It's been tracking us since we left Earth.</i>

03:47.974 --> 03:49.805
It's taken three million years?!

03:49.943 --> 03:53.504
<i>Yeah, that's about average</i>
<i>for second-class post.</i>

03:58.552 --> 04:01.077
(CAPS BANG)

04:03.557 --> 04:06.390
See what I mean?
(HOLLERS LIKE RED INDIAN)

04:16.769 --> 04:20.331
There's everything, all the mail,
a new batch of movies...

04:20.473 --> 04:26.639
Oh, the new Friday 13th movie,
Friday 13th Part 1,649.

04:27.714 --> 04:30.308
Casablanca! They've re-made Casablanca.

04:30.450 --> 04:34.284
Philistines! I mean, Casablanca?

04:34.421 --> 04:38.414
The one starring Myra Binglebat
and Peter Beardsley was definitive.

04:38.558 --> 04:43.427
<i>I saw that. Knockout.</i>
<i>"Of all the space bars in all the worlds,</i>

04:43.563 --> 04:46.361
<i>"you had to re-materialise in mine."</i>

04:46.499 --> 04:49.434
Look, a whole year of Earth news.

04:49.569 --> 04:51.799
And two seasons of zero-G football.

04:51.938 --> 04:56.739
- I'll see you in the spring.
- What are total immersion video games?

04:56.876 --> 05:03.213
Where?! Oh, these are brilliant!
You can't get these for love nor money.

05:03.350 --> 05:08.549
These are like Venus' arms.
These are like Brooke Shields' buttocks.

05:08.688 --> 05:11.816
- What are they?
- They're computer games, aren't they?

05:11.958 --> 05:16.088
But electrodes are inserted
into your frontal lobes, right?

05:16.229 --> 05:20.689
So, you actually feel
as though you're really there. Yes!

05:20.834 --> 05:23.132
Fine. Holly, there's a video letter for you.

05:23.269 --> 05:25.032
<i>Bung it on.</i>

05:27.340 --> 05:31.777
- <i>Strike a lightl It's Gordon.</i>
- Who's Gordon?

05:31.911 --> 05:37.816
<i>The Al computer on the Scott Fitzgerald.</i>
<i>He's got an IQ of 8,000.</i>

05:37.951 --> 05:41.910
<i>All right, Hol? It... It's Gordon.</i>

05:42.055 --> 05:44.250
<i>Awesome, his intellect, I tell you.</i>

05:44.391 --> 05:47.224
<i>Here's the latest move in our chess game.</i>

05:47.360 --> 05:53.663
<i>My move is pawn... That's the little</i>
<i>knobbly ones down the front...</i>

05:53.800 --> 05:57.236
<i>Pawn to King 4. Your move.</i>

05:57.370 --> 05:59.565
<i>Well, I'd better sign off now.</i>

05:59.706 --> 06:02.402
<i>See you, Hol. Bye.</i>

06:08.648 --> 06:11.640
<i>H... How do you turn this off, then?</i>

06:13.653 --> 06:16.019
You were playing postal chess with him?

06:16.156 --> 06:20.820
<i>A chance to challenge that intellect?</i>
<i>I'd be a fool not to.</i>

06:20.960 --> 06:24.794
<i>Pawn to King 4, eh? He's a sly one.</i>

06:25.865 --> 06:29.562
- So, who's winning, Hol?
- <i>Well, he is really.</i>

06:29.703 --> 06:31.898
<i>That was the first move.</i>

06:46.019 --> 06:48.146
(LISTER) Me... Me...

06:48.288 --> 06:52.554
- You... Me...
- It's all junk mail, yours, you know?

06:52.692 --> 06:56.093
Me... Me... Me...

06:56.229 --> 06:59.027
You send off for every bit of rubbish going,

06:59.165 --> 07:01.326
just so you have mail to open.

07:01.468 --> 07:04.301
Me... Me...

07:04.437 --> 07:08.874
"Please rush me my portable
walrus-polishing kit.

07:09.008 --> 07:14.571
"Four super brushes that clean even
the trickiest of seabound mammals."

07:14.714 --> 07:17.979
"Yes, I am over 18, although my IQ isn't."

07:18.451 --> 07:20.476
Me... Me...

07:20.620 --> 07:23.919
Smeg! Outland Revenue.

07:24.057 --> 07:26.617
Oh-oh-oh! Outland Revenue.

07:27.327 --> 07:29.420
8,500?

07:29.729 --> 07:34.962
8,500?! That's a lot!
How will you pay for that, eh?

07:35.101 --> 07:37.126
I'm not. It's yours.

07:37.270 --> 07:38.965
What?!

07:40.640 --> 07:44.303
No. This is wrong. This is well wrong, Lister.

07:44.444 --> 07:47.072
Relax. They won't catch you now.

07:47.213 --> 07:51.650
Because we're three million years
into deep space and humans are extinct?

07:51.785 --> 07:55.380
That means nothing to them. They'll find us.

07:55.522 --> 08:00.391
- I'll be worrying all the time now.
- Me... Oh, another one for you.

08:00.527 --> 08:03.155
"Rear Admiral Lieutenant General Rimmer"?!

08:04.330 --> 08:05.592
That's from my mother.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.690
Rear Admiral?

08:08.835 --> 08:11.736
Whenever I take an exam, I say I passed.

08:11.871 --> 08:15.637
By now, I should be in charge of the universe.

08:15.775 --> 08:18.039
- Shall I open it?
- Open it.

08:19.779 --> 08:22.771
"Dear Rimmer..." Is this from your mum?

08:23.650 --> 08:25.379
That's Mumsie.

08:25.518 --> 08:27.315
This handwriting's terrible.

08:27.453 --> 08:31.549
"I hope this epistle finds you adequately healthy

08:31.691 --> 08:33.488
"to discharge your duties..."

08:33.793 --> 08:36.659
Maybe I shouldn't read this deeply personal stuff.

08:36.796 --> 08:42.234
- Just get on with it.
- "I write to..." I can't read that.

08:42.368 --> 08:47.431
Oh, "I write to inform you
that your father is dad."

08:47.574 --> 08:51.806
Well, of course he is. Maybe it's "your father/dad".

08:52.478 --> 08:54.537
- "Dead".
- I can't make it out.

08:54.681 --> 08:56.808
- My father is dead.
- What?

08:57.450 --> 08:59.281
My father is dead.

08:59.419 --> 09:01.284
Oh, yeah, it's an "E"!

09:01.421 --> 09:05.152
That's what it is. Your father's dead, Rimmer.

09:08.628 --> 09:12.587
Oh, eh. Sorry.

09:16.803 --> 09:18.566
Is that all she says?

09:18.705 --> 09:22.641
Just that he passed away peacefully in his Jeep.

09:25.378 --> 09:26.743
Sleep.

09:52.872 --> 09:55.841
- Can't sleep?
- Hmm.

09:55.975 --> 10:00.776
- (SIGHS) No, me, neither.
- Hmmm.

10:00.914 --> 10:05.510
I remember when my dad died. I was only six.

10:05.652 --> 10:09.748
I got loads of presents off everyone
like it was Christmas.

10:09.889 --> 10:12.255
I remember wishing more people would die,

10:12.392 --> 10:15.088
so I could complete me Lego set.

10:17.196 --> 10:21.997
My grandma tried to explain. She said
he'd gone away and wasn't coming back.

10:22.135 --> 10:24.626
I wanted to know where.

10:24.771 --> 10:29.105
She said he was happy and he'd gone
to the same place as me goldfish.

10:29.242 --> 10:31.904
I thought they'd flushed him down the bog.

10:34.080 --> 10:37.675
I thought he was just
round the U-bend, you know?

10:37.817 --> 10:42.345
I used to stuff food down
and magazines for him to read.

10:42.488 --> 10:45.457
They took me to a child psychologist

10:45.591 --> 10:49.721
when they found me with my head down
the bowl reading the football results.

10:53.199 --> 10:55.064
I knew he was dead.

10:55.201 --> 10:57.328
I mean, they're all dead, aren't they?

10:58.538 --> 11:01.769
But that letter makes it seem
like it happened yesterday.

11:02.976 --> 11:06.002
- You never said much about him.
- No.

11:06.145 --> 11:08.807
- You must have been pretty close.
- Close?

11:08.948 --> 11:11.781
- Sorry. Very close.
- Close?

11:12.785 --> 11:14.548
I hated him.

11:14.687 --> 11:19.454
I detested his fat, stupid guts,
the pop-eyed, balding git.

11:19.592 --> 11:23.028
- Eh?
- He wanted to join the Space Corps,

11:23.162 --> 11:27.292
be an officer, but he was an inch
below regulation height.

11:27.433 --> 11:28.957
One inch.

11:29.102 --> 11:31.070
I had three brothers.

11:31.204 --> 11:36.141
When we were young, he bought
a traction machine to stretch us.

11:36.275 --> 11:41.042
By the time my brother Frank
was eleven, he was six foot five.

11:41.180 --> 11:45.844
Every morning, he'd measure us.
If we hadn't grown, back on the rack.

11:46.819 --> 11:48.411
Sounds like he had a screw loose.

11:48.554 --> 11:52.456
I don't think he had one screw
tightened, to be honest.

11:52.592 --> 11:55.891
He had this fixation with the Space Corps.

11:56.029 --> 11:59.521
At meal times, he'd ask us questions
on astronavigation.

11:59.665 --> 12:03.965
- If we got them wrong, no food.
- How did you cope?

12:04.103 --> 12:07.004
I didn't. I nearly died of malnutrition.

12:08.341 --> 12:11.208
I thought you adored your parents.

12:11.344 --> 12:14.472
- When I was 14, I divorced them.
- What?

12:15.014 --> 12:16.538
I took them to court.

12:16.682 --> 12:18.946
I got paid maintenance until employment age

12:19.085 --> 12:21.645
and weekend access to the dog.

12:23.089 --> 12:26.024
So, why are you so completely blown away
about him dying, then?

12:26.159 --> 12:30.823
Oh, I still respected him.
It was natural. He was my father.

12:30.963 --> 12:33.727
There's nothing natural
about your family, Rimmer.

12:34.500 --> 12:37.469
It's just... I always wanted just once,

12:37.603 --> 12:42.199
just once, for him to say to me, "Well done".

12:43.509 --> 12:45.670
- For what?
- For something, anything.

12:45.812 --> 12:49.475
I wanted him to be proud of me,
just once. And now...

12:49.615 --> 12:54.075
(CAT) Aow! My stomach has been pumped,
and now I'm hungry.

12:54.220 --> 12:59.453
Hey, there you are!
Hey, I'm so hungry, I just have to eat.

12:59.592 --> 13:01.457
Rimmer's dad's died.

13:01.594 --> 13:04.290
I'd prefer chicken.

13:27.220 --> 13:30.917
<i>Good evening. Here is the news</i>

- Pause!

About your father. If it's any help,
he's in the ground now.

14:10.263 --> 14:12.094
Sure, it's bad news for him,

14:12.231 --> 14:16.895
but it's party time for all the little worms.

14:22.074 --> 14:24.736
There's just no consoling him.

14:27.914 --> 14:32.442
Me and the Cat are playing a TIV.
Do you want to come?

14:33.085 --> 14:37.078
Come on. Holly can key you in.

the actress from the 20th century.

16:35.841 --> 16:38.105
Er... Mary Magdalene.

16:39.278 --> 16:44.079
It's Marilyn Monroe, you gimp.
I think she fancies you.

16:44.383 --> 16:46.715
What does that prove? She's not blind.

16:46.852 --> 16:50.253
Hey, baby. I'll catch you later, OK?

16:51.757 --> 16:54.624
It's absolutely incredible.

16:56.362 --> 16:58.660
Look! Look!

17:00.333 --> 17:03.302
Excuse me. You're probably really busy,

17:03.436 --> 17:06.963
but you are my all-time favourite dictator.

17:07.106 --> 17:11.133
I've read all your war diaries.
Your Italian campaign was brilliant.

17:11.277 --> 17:14.973
Er... Could you just sign this for me?

17:15.114 --> 17:21.144
Make it out, "To my good pal Arnie
from your chum Napoleon Bonaparte."

17:21.287 --> 17:25.916
It's not for me, it's for my sister, Alison.
Er... We call her Arnie.

17:33.833 --> 17:37.098
Gentlemen. Welcome to Better Than Life.

17:37.236 --> 17:41.536
You must be hungry.
There's a restaurant down the beach.

17:41.674 --> 17:43.767
How do we get there?

17:43.909 --> 17:48.437
Anyway you want. This is Better Than Life.

17:48.581 --> 17:50.776
Any way we want?

17:56.422 --> 17:58.185
Yo!

18:15.040 --> 18:18.339

18:46.405 --> 18:48.805
Yes, I am!

18:51.510 --> 18:54.877
We're just one thing away from perfection.

18:56.382 --> 18:58.407
Bliss.

19:18.003 --> 19:20.301
Where's Rimmer?
I thought he was right behind us.

19:20.439 --> 19:24.068
Your caviar vindaloo, sir.

Half rice, half chips and lots more
bread and butter to follow.

- I've never eaten anything this classy.
- Better Than Life, sir.

19:32.985 --> 19:37.081
- Yours was the fish, sir?
- What are you doing?!

19:37.223 --> 19:40.681
I always do this when someone gives me food.

19:43.929 --> 19:49.094
As ordered. A small aquarium.
Are you sure you wouldn't like one cooked?

19:49.235 --> 19:53.535
No, sir. I like my food to move.

19:53.672 --> 19:55.731

19:55.875 --> 19:59.834
Mr Rimmer... sir.

They're on table K on the second terrace.

20:02.848 --> 20:04.611
Excellent.

I'm sorry. I don't know what happened.

20:17.963 --> 20:21.592
I was driving along,
and suddenly, there was McGruder.

20:21.734 --> 20:26.364
Well, one thing led to another and...
God, this is a great game!

20:26.505 --> 20:29.838
Twice in one lifetime? I'm becoming Hugh Hefner.

20:31.510 --> 20:35.537
- Rimmer, you can touch things!
- Why do you think I was late?

20:37.182 --> 20:39.810
- Have you seen your room?
- What room?

20:39.952 --> 20:45.447
Mine is brilliant. I've got a vibrating
waterbed in the shape of a guitar.

20:45.591 --> 20:48.788
Yeah? Well, you should see my wardrobe.

20:48.928 --> 20:52.659
It's so big it crosses a time zone.

20:52.798 --> 20:58.100
When it's 3.00 where my shirts are,
it's 7 am for my socks.

20:58.237 --> 21:00.899
- (MAN) Admiral?
- What about my electronic lavvy?

21:01.040 --> 21:05.534
It comes when you call,
takes your trousers down, does everything.

21:05.678 --> 21:07.873
- It's just so stylish.
- (MAN) Admiral.

21:08.013 --> 21:13.849
Who is that? Just because he knows
an Admiral, does he have to broadcast it?

21:13.986 --> 21:15.817
(MAN) Admiral Rimmer, sir.

Admiral Rimmer, Field Marshall Clifton
sends his compliments

21:26.565 --> 21:29.295
and wonders if you'd join him for cigars.

21:29.435 --> 21:33.201
There must be some mistake. I'm not an admiral.

21:36.241 --> 21:38.835
I love this game.

22:04.837 --> 22:06.896
So, I said to Hollister...

22:08.340 --> 22:10.331
Well, I can't actually remember what I said,

22:10.476 --> 22:15.413

frighteningly witty put-downs ever.

- There you go, laddo.
- Gosh, I'll be the envy of the academy.

22:49.448 --> 22:52.042
- Father.
- Son.

22:52.584 --> 22:56.247
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry to barge in on you

22:56.388 --> 22:59.551

- Yes?
- I just wanted to tell you...

- Yes?
- I just wanted to say...

- Yes?
- I just wanted to say...

No, it's mine.

Yes! Whoo!

- Are you telling me how to play?

and another girl who's a mermaid.

Who are all those guys?

It's McGruder. She got pregnant,

25:41.253 --> 25:43.517
so this morning, she made me marry her,

25:43.822 --> 25:46.689
