WEBVTT

00:05.255 --> 00:06.256
{\an3}Morning.

00:06.339 --> 00:07.757
David, hi.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.135
You know what, I'm just about
to get going so...

00:10.218 --> 00:12.887
I just need a minute, two tops.

00:12.971 --> 00:14.222
No, look, if this
is about Noah...

00:14.305 --> 00:16.433
{\an3}No, why would this
be about Noah?

00:16.516 --> 00:18.101
Well, I don't know. Maybe 'cause
the last time I saw you,

00:18.184 --> 00:19.477
all you wanted to do
was argue about him.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.938
That was before I

00:22.021 --> 00:23.356
realized what an
angel you were.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.483
Don't. Angel?

00:25.567 --> 00:27.152
You know, I lie.

00:27.235 --> 00:28.737
I give you
every reason to hate me

00:28.820 --> 00:30.321
and you still
come through.

00:30.405 --> 00:31.573
How did I come through?

00:31.656 --> 00:32.573
{\an3}Donna...

00:32.656 --> 00:35.326
By paying off my debt to Sands.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.287
{\an3}Sands?
Everett Sands.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.456
The guy I borrowed the money
from, the loan shark.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.124
And I promise,

00:41.207 --> 00:43.293
I'll pay you back, all right?
All 15 grand.

00:43.376 --> 00:46.296
When did you borrow money
from this guy?

00:46.379 --> 00:48.256
{\an1}What do you mean, when?
When?

00:48.339 --> 00:49.674
As in before or after
you confessed

00:49.758 --> 00:51.134
to being in so much trouble?

00:51.217 --> 00:52.510
{\an1}Before.
So what you

00:52.594 --> 00:54.345
said was the truth
was really a lie.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.059
It wasn't you, was it?

01:01.060 --> 01:02.020
{\an3}You...

01:02.103 --> 01:04.438
you didn't pay off Sands?

01:04.522 --> 01:05.190
No.

01:05.272 --> 01:07.233
How could it be?

01:07.317 --> 01:09.527
You kept it a secret from me,
just like everything else.

01:11.196 --> 01:12.447
I think you should go now.

01:12.530 --> 01:13.656
Don...

01:13.740 --> 01:14.657
{\an1}David.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.951
Please. Come on, let's go.

01:18.411 --> 01:19.287
Wait a second,

01:19.370 --> 01:20.830
you're kicking me out?

01:20.914 --> 01:22.332
Yeah. Good-bye.

01:35.553 --> 01:37.222
{\an3}So what does Brandon think
of your new haircut?

01:37.305 --> 01:39.182
{\an3}He loves it.
Good.

01:45.396 --> 01:46.689
Hey, good morning.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.024
{\an3}Good morning.
Mmm!

01:48.107 --> 01:49.317
Did you ever
hook up with Dylan?

01:49.400 --> 01:50.819
{\an3}Yeah, about
ten minutes ago.

01:52.445 --> 01:54.989
You didn't tell him
about me, did you?

01:55.073 --> 01:56.491
Didn't have to.

01:56.574 --> 01:58.535
Iris, right?

01:58.618 --> 02:00.703
Actually, she did you a favor,
if you think about it.

02:01.830 --> 02:02.914
You don't want to go live
with Dylan?

02:04.791 --> 02:06.209
No way.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.210
Are you serious?

02:07.293 --> 02:08.044
Mm-hmm.

02:08.127 --> 02:08.877
{\an3}KELLY:
It was her idea.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.213
She knows how close you
and Dylan are.

02:10.295 --> 02:11.506
Not that she doesn't want you.

02:11.589 --> 02:12.715
She does. It's just

02:12.799 --> 02:14.342
she thinks that
for now it would be better

02:14.425 --> 02:15.718
if custody were
transferred to Dylan.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.762
This is so cool.

02:18.763 --> 02:20.348
But I can't leave yet.

02:20.431 --> 02:22.559
Not while you're still
in trouble because of me.

02:22.642 --> 02:24.143
{\an3}I'm not in trouble.
What about

02:24.227 --> 02:25.103
the district attorney?

02:25.186 --> 02:26.980
Eh, she threatened me.
I called her bluff.

02:27.063 --> 02:28.231
{\an5}She's torturing
somebody else already.
(doorbell rings)

02:28.314 --> 02:29.524
It's over.

02:31.359 --> 02:32.277
Don't worry.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.403
BRANDON:
I'm telling you,

02:33.486 --> 02:35.155
she's forgotten all about me.

02:36.489 --> 02:39.367
Brandon Walsh, we have a warrant
for your arrest.

02:39.450 --> 02:42.412
You are being charged with being
an accessory to a felony,

02:42.495 --> 02:43.913
{\an1}Section 32
of the Penal Code.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.206
Brandon, what's going on?

02:45.290 --> 02:46.791
It's just
a misunderstanding, Kel.

02:46.875 --> 02:47.834
Call a lawyer, will you?

02:47.917 --> 02:49.878
{\an3}OFFICER: You have the right
to remain silent.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.754
{\an3}If you give up your
right to remain silent,

02:51.838 --> 02:52.630
{\an1}anything you say
can and will

02:52.714 --> 02:55.133
be used against you
in a court of law.

{\an3}Hi.

04:43.032 --> 04:44.659
{\an3}Hey, Carly.
How is he?

04:45.660 --> 04:46.869
TERRI:
Well, on a scale

04:46.953 --> 04:48.746
of one to ten? 2,000.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.376
I-I like kids.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.670
Oh, who's kidding?
I love kids.

04:55.753 --> 04:57.672
But other people's kids.

04:57.755 --> 04:59.382
Maybe even my kids, too,
when I'm ready,

04:59.465 --> 05:01.092
but I'm not even ready yet!

05:01.175 --> 05:03.219
{\an3}Uh, Danish?

05:03.302 --> 05:05.388
You have to eat.

05:05.471 --> 05:06.764
You think this is my kid?

05:08.307 --> 05:10.560
How long until you get
the test results back?

05:10.643 --> 05:12.311
46 hours and 29 minutes.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.063
Give or take.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.732
I think you'd be pretty
exacting, too,

05:15.815 --> 05:17.567
if your world
was coming to an end.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.652
Well, I thought you were
at peace with this.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.947
I haven't slept in days.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.408
{\an1}I'm literally
so anxious,

05:25.491 --> 05:27.452
I-I can feel...

05:27.535 --> 05:30.413
my heart racing in my chest!

05:30.496 --> 05:32.040
Ah, I get sick
when I think about

05:32.123 --> 05:33.082
what Jodi's doing to me.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.250
She's only asking

05:34.334 --> 05:35.835
for your help
if it's your child.

05:35.918 --> 05:37.587
Is that supposed to make me feel
better?

05:37.670 --> 05:39.547
{\an1}Is it?

05:39.630 --> 05:42.091
Because it doesn't.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.927
She wants this kid,
and it's her choice.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.263
I've got no choice.

05:47.346 --> 05:48.639
Nothing. Zip!

05:48.723 --> 05:49.766
Zilch! Zero!

05:49.849 --> 05:51.851
(phone ringing)

05:53.686 --> 05:55.688
Yeah, what?!

05:57.315 --> 05:58.900
Lawyer?

06:00.860 --> 06:02.487
Yeah, I'm sure he can.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.282
All right. I'm on it.
I'm there.

06:07.575 --> 06:08.785
What?

06:08.868 --> 06:11.704
Brandon got arrested today.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.761
We can't touch.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.305
Are you okay?

06:29.388 --> 06:31.808
{\an3}Yeah, sure, all
things considered.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.476
They took my belt

06:33.559 --> 06:34.894
and my watch.

06:36.395 --> 06:37.939
Really don't feel
the need to spend

06:38.022 --> 06:39.440
much more time inside.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.275
I can't believe
this is happening.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.444
Steve talked to Rush.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.821
He's got a lawyer
working on bail.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.656
{\an3}She says I should be
home in time for dinner.

06:46.739 --> 06:49.659
Did she say how to get these
ridiculous charges dropped?

06:49.742 --> 06:51.202
She didn't have to tell me.

06:51.285 --> 06:53.621
I know.

06:53.704 --> 06:54.664
I'm not doing it.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.249
{\an3}Brandon.
Kel...

06:56.332 --> 06:57.458
we've been over this.

06:57.542 --> 06:58.668
Then let's go over it again.

06:58.751 --> 06:59.961
No.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.840
Brandon, you could go
to jail for five years.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.383
But I won't.

07:06.884 --> 07:09.137
I'm doing the right thing.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.972
Not according to the D.A.

07:11.055 --> 07:13.141
The D.A.'s wrong and a judge
and jury will see that.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.350
And what if they don't?

07:14.433 --> 07:15.601
They will.

07:15.685 --> 07:16.936
But what if they don't?

07:23.901 --> 07:26.529
Okay, let me get this straight.

07:27.613 --> 07:28.739
Donna dumps you.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.491
{\an1}She immediately
starts seeing Noah,

07:30.575 --> 07:33.661
{\an1}and you think she's the one
who bailed you out?

07:33.744 --> 07:35.496
It was a selfless
thing to do

07:35.580 --> 07:37.039
and I don't know
many selfless people.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.583
Present company excluded.

07:38.666 --> 07:41.586
Hey, I would've asked you
if you weren't, uh, unemployed

07:41.669 --> 07:44.172
{\an1}and broke.
Thanks. I think.

07:44.255 --> 07:47.842
Steve, Kelly and Brandon
don't have that kind of cash.

07:47.925 --> 07:50.344
Well, uh, how about your dad?

07:50.428 --> 07:51.846
{\an3}No way.

07:53.431 --> 07:54.724
Noah's broke.

07:54.807 --> 07:56.017
Carly's broke.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.059
Donna's...

07:57.143 --> 07:58.728
Sleeping with the enemy.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.063
{\an1}She is not.
Okay.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.608
Petting with the enemy.
It still hurts.

08:04.650 --> 08:07.111
What about asking your friend,
uh, the loan shark?

08:07.195 --> 08:08.154
{\an1}Sands?

08:08.237 --> 08:10.406
What and be mistaken
for a punching bag again?

08:10.489 --> 08:11.407
No, thanks.

08:11.490 --> 08:13.492
Well, maybe he'll treat me
with more respect.

08:13.576 --> 08:16.621
Why are you so interested
in who paid off my debt?

08:16.704 --> 08:18.247
Don't you want to know
who bailed you out?

08:19.290 --> 08:21.000
Yeah.

08:22.084 --> 08:25.129
What was I thinking? Money!

08:25.213 --> 08:26.422
Let me guess.

08:26.505 --> 08:28.090
You caught a whiff
of that cold, hard cash.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.134
Just let me know
how you got ahold of Sands.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.679
Dan, the Bartender.

08:35.097 --> 08:36.432
Well, you can't

08:36.515 --> 08:38.433
find a loan shark
in the Yellow Pages.

08:38.517 --> 08:40.895
Well, then we'll just have
a little chat with Dan.

08:45.691 --> 08:46.984
Oh, boy.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.948
(heater humming)

08:55.868 --> 08:57.912
(knocking)
Come in.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.335
{\an3}Hey.
Hey, stranger.

09:06.337 --> 09:07.630
{\an1}What's up
with the camera gear?

09:07.713 --> 09:09.674
I just thought I'd take
some test shots of the boat.

09:09.757 --> 09:11.676
There's talk of a shoot here.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.219
Shoot away.

09:16.722 --> 09:17.932
It's been a long time.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.478
Yeah, I, uh,
I've been working real hard.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.605
So you just stopped by
to check on your boat, huh?

09:27.733 --> 09:29.652
You mad?

09:29.735 --> 09:31.153
No, I just prefer honesty
is all.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.948
{\an1}You didn't stay away
because of work.

09:34.031 --> 09:35.157
You stayed away
because of David.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.159
Look, David and I just broke up.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.787
I just felt like
I was moving too fast.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.039
Is that bad?

09:42.123 --> 09:44.917
No, it's just
not what I would have done.

09:46.711 --> 09:49.922
You know, maybe me coming here
wasn't such a good idea.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.218
That's your call.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.513
You're not giving me much here.

09:57.596 --> 09:59.974
Look, what happened last week

10:00.057 --> 10:01.559
was pretty
spur of the moment.

10:01.642 --> 10:03.019
We shouldn't
feel guilty about it.

10:04.895 --> 10:06.355
It's what we do next
that counts.

10:13.904 --> 10:15.656
So what do we do next?

10:15.740 --> 10:17.700
Take some test shots.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.827
{\an1}Beyond that, we'll just
wait and see what happens.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.040
{\an3}I know you think what
Brandon's doing is wrong,

10:24.123 --> 10:26.751
{\an3}but try to see things
from his side.

10:26.834 --> 10:29.211
Like you're doing with Jodi?

10:29.295 --> 10:30.421
That's different.

10:30.504 --> 10:31.756
No, it's the same.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.758
{\an1}They're both facing
hard decisions

10:33.841 --> 10:35.760
{\an1}and they're making
choices that we don't like.

10:35.843 --> 10:37.762
{\an3}Brandon's fighting
for a principle.

10:37.845 --> 10:39.555
Jodi's trying to
change my life.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.223
{\an3}That's a whole
different ball game.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.059
{\an1}I guess you're
right, but, Steve,

10:43.142 --> 10:46.437
if Brandon goes to jail, it's
going to change my life, too.

10:46.520 --> 10:47.980
{\an3}RUSH:
Hello, you two.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.106
{\an4}Hi, Dad.
DONNA:
Hey.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.232
You're looking good, son.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.400
{\an1}Hi, Kelly.
Hey.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.485
How are you?

10:52.568 --> 10:54.653
{\an5}All right, depending
on your news.
All right.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.030
Brandon made bail.

10:56.113 --> 10:57.239
{\an3}He'll be out
in a few minutes.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.699
{\an1}Thank you for
all of your help.

10:58.783 --> 10:59.700
Just a little debt of gratitude

10:59.784 --> 11:01.077
I owe this guy
for putting me on the straight

11:01.160 --> 11:04.038
{\an6}and narrow.
You're not still mad at me
for the sweatshop deal?

11:04.121 --> 11:06.248
Well, it was a hell
of a life's lesson.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.251
Mad? Couldn't be more proud.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.628
What about this fiasco?

11:10.711 --> 11:11.921
{\an6}BRANDON:
Free at last.
Free at last.

11:12.004 --> 11:14.256
STEVE:
Well, he emerges unscathed.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.634
Completely.

11:16.717 --> 11:17.802
Hey, baby.

11:17.885 --> 11:19.011
Uh, Kelly, Steve,
this is Ann.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.262
Ann, this is Kelly and Steve.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.514
{\an5}Hi.
Hello.
Ann's my new hero.

11:21.597 --> 11:23.557
You should've heard what she
said to bust me out of there.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.059
{\an6}ANN:
Nothing I don't
believe in.

11:25.142 --> 11:26.769
Freedom of the press,
the First Amendment--

11:26.852 --> 11:27.937
those are easy to defend.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.063
And to promote, too.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.106
{\an1}I can see
the headlines now.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.566
"Editor Imprisoned: Martyr
For the Rights of Others."

11:32.650 --> 11:34.568
{\an4}What do you think?
You sure you really
want to use the word

11:34.652 --> 11:35.778
{\an1}"martyr" in the headline?
Why not?

11:35.861 --> 11:36.612
{\an1}I love it.

11:36.695 --> 11:38.114
Yeah, we should do
a second edition.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.116
{\an1}Pump it up.
That's not a bad idea.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.617
You guys act like
you won something.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.327
Kel?

11:43.411 --> 11:44.328
No.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.704
What do we do now?

11:45.788 --> 11:47.081
{\an1}Mills wants us back here
tomorrow morning

11:47.164 --> 11:48.290
for a meeting, 8:00.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.960

14:49.388 --> 14:51.015
I'm homeless.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.984
(indistinct chatter)

15:03.235 --> 15:04.987
I told you to get him
four of the Polish stuff

15:05.070 --> 15:06.780
and two of the Russian.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.157
Now!

15:08.240 --> 15:09.366
What a jerk.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.827
Who, me?

15:11.910 --> 15:14.163
I've got a terrible feeling
that you're lost.

15:14.246 --> 15:18.292
{\an1}Well, not if you're
Everett Sands.

15:18.375 --> 15:19.293
Guilty as charged.

15:19.376 --> 15:21.295
{\an1}Well, then I'm
in the right place.

15:21.378 --> 15:22.838
Hi, I'm Valerie Malone.

15:22.921 --> 15:24.923
I'm a friend of Dan's
from the After Dark.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.383
Are you in difficulty?

15:26.467 --> 15:29.887
'Cause, um, I could set up
some very favorable terms.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.680
Yeah, I'm sure you could.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.682
But I'm here
because of a friend of mine.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.142
David Silver.

15:37.603 --> 15:40.981
You want to do business with me,
we'll do business.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.149
Not talk about other
people's business.

15:42.232 --> 15:45.569
{\an1}Well, I was hoping
maybe I could bribe you.

15:45.653 --> 15:48.113
I don't know,
with my charm.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.035
Seems to me you have
quite a lot of that.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.161
What's your angle?

15:54.244 --> 15:58.540
Well, just think of me
as a nice girl with bad habits.

15:58.624 --> 16:02.044
I might need someone
to bail me out sometime.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.546
A name would be really helpful.

16:07.007 --> 16:08.425
You didn't hear it from me.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.177
Hunter.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.429
Noah Hunter.

16:13.597 --> 16:15.224
Noah Hunter?

16:15.307 --> 16:16.767
You must have the wrong name.

16:16.850 --> 16:18.352
I didn't ask for his I.D.,

16:18.435 --> 16:19.561
but that's definitely
the guy's name.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.730
Noah Hunter.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.607
He's a bum.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.901
Maybe, but he's a bum
with a lot of cash in his jeans.

16:25.984 --> 16:27.277
No way. He's broke.

16:27.361 --> 16:28.445
He works on boats for a living.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.114
I don't know
what he does for fun.

16:30.197 --> 16:32.408
But believe me,
this kid is loaded.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.660
And I'm not talking
chump change either.

16:34.743 --> 16:36.203
This is serious money.

16:36.286 --> 16:37.871
{\an3}Excuse me.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.879
BRANDON:
<i>My position has the support</i>

16:45.963 --> 16:47.589
{\an1}of the Bill of Rights,
Miss Mills.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.133
{\an1}It seems to me
that the Constitution

16:49.216 --> 16:50.426
{\an1}carries a little
more weight than what...

16:50.509 --> 16:52.136
{\an3}I don't need
a lecture from you

16:52.219 --> 16:53.846
on the constitutional law,
Mr. Walsh.

16:53.929 --> 16:55.931
I'm the assistant
district attorney.

16:56.014 --> 16:58.392
{\an3}My responsibility
is the safety

16:58.475 --> 17:00.102
of the citizens
of this county.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.312
Once again,
being an accessory

17:02.396 --> 17:05.232
means preventing the arrest,
prosecution...

17:05.315 --> 17:07.443
{\an1}And incarceration
of an alleged felon.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.278
{\an1}I know what
the statute says.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.070
Then you should also know
that you're violating it.

17:11.155 --> 17:11.864
The letter,

17:11.946 --> 17:13.741
{\an3}maybe, not the spirit.
Do you think

17:13.824 --> 17:16.492
that your source is the only
teenager working for Riggs?

17:16.577 --> 17:18.244
No.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.289
Do you think that
she's the only one he abused?

17:20.372 --> 17:22.207
{\an3}No.
How many

17:22.290 --> 17:24.251
do you think that
he's abused since you

17:24.334 --> 17:26.252
first refused
to disclose your source?

17:26.336 --> 17:27.963
This isn't getting us anywhere.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.298
{\an3}MILLS:
Three? Four?

17:29.381 --> 17:31.258
And how many kids does
he have to destroy before

17:31.341 --> 17:32.509
you stop protecting him?

17:32.593 --> 17:33.510
Miss Mills.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.637
{\an1}Please.

17:39.057 --> 17:40.142
He beats them.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.020
Even when they
work for him,

17:43.103 --> 17:44.813
he beats them; what do you think
he's going to do

17:44.897 --> 17:46.190
to someone who turns him in?

17:46.273 --> 17:47.191
We'll protect her.

17:47.274 --> 17:48.442
For now, maybe.

17:48.525 --> 17:51.487
What about in a month, when
you've moved on to another case?

17:51.570 --> 17:53.781
What about in a year,
when Riggs gets out on parole?

17:53.864 --> 17:55.032
What're you going
to do for her then?

17:55.115 --> 17:58.327
I thought a day in jail would
bring you back to your senses.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.870
I know exactly what I'm doing.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.330
I'm not giving you my source.

18:02.372 --> 18:03.624
Then I'll see you in court.

18:03.707 --> 18:04.958
{\an3}And that'll

18:05.042 --> 18:06.335
be very soon.

you work at.

20:12.544 --> 20:13.670
Well, we can't force

20:13.754 --> 20:15.172
people to work here.

20:15.255 --> 20:17.424
Well, the doctor who volunteered
must have graduated,

20:17.507 --> 20:20.010
what, last in his class?

20:20.093 --> 20:22.054
Either that
or he's incredibly dedicated

20:42.908 --> 20:45.494
you are legally required
to pay support, okay?

20:45.577 --> 20:46.870
So thanks for nothing.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.875
You're a jerk.
You know that?

20:53.710 --> 20:55.504
I'm a jerk?

20:55.587 --> 20:57.422
You show up

20:57.506 --> 21:00.801
out of nowhere, turn my life
upside down and I'm a jerk, huh?

21:00.884 --> 21:03.178
Well, I'm sorry.

21:03.261 --> 21:05.722
It's just that I'm carrying

21:05.806 --> 21:08.392
the most precious baby
inside of me,

21:08.475 --> 21:10.310
and you seem to think
that I am carrying

21:10.394 --> 21:12.020
this incredible burden.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.314
This isn't about
how I feel about the baby.

21:15.315 --> 21:17.025
And I resent you saying that.

21:17.109 --> 21:20.112
Well, a father is a father.

21:20.195 --> 21:22.155
Not just an ATM.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.869
Hey, kid.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.705
Thought I'd see what
you've done to the place.

21:29.788 --> 21:30.998
Check in on Brandon.

21:31.081 --> 21:33.166
How's he doing?

21:33.250 --> 21:34.876
Hello?

21:38.630 --> 21:41.550
Hey, Dad, when you got
my birth mother pregnant,

21:41.633 --> 21:42.884
how did you handle it?

21:42.968 --> 21:44.428
What do you mean?

21:44.511 --> 21:47.556
I mean, did you accept
responsibility right away?

21:50.851 --> 21:53.687
No. No, not right away.

21:55.313 --> 21:56.106
Why?

21:56.189 --> 21:58.525
I was just curious.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.454
Hey.

22:14.166 --> 22:17.002
If you're here to criticize,
I'll save you the trouble.

22:19.588 --> 22:23.133
No, I-I heard about the fire.

22:23.216 --> 22:26.595
And I, I just wanted to see
if you needed anything.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.930
Really? Heard from who?

22:29.014 --> 22:30.265
David...

22:30.348 --> 22:31.767
From who?

22:31.850 --> 22:33.226
The point is...

22:33.310 --> 22:35.270
No, the point is...

22:35.353 --> 22:36.563
you heard from Noah, right?

22:38.356 --> 22:40.442
What, were you guys on a date,
on a sail,

22:40.525 --> 22:41.401
walking on the beach

22:41.485 --> 22:42.235
hand in hand?

22:42.319 --> 22:45.030
Yeah, I did,
I, I heard it from him.

22:45.113 --> 22:47.282
But I'm concerned.

22:47.365 --> 22:52.120
And I thought that i-if you need
a place to stay,

22:52.204 --> 22:55.290
maybe you could come back
to the apartment.

22:55.373 --> 22:57.334
{\an1}You know, until you get
things in order.

22:57.417 --> 22:59.461
What things would those be?

22:59.544 --> 23:01.088
My office?

23:01.171 --> 23:02.130
My finances?

23:02.214 --> 23:03.173
My love life?

23:03.256 --> 23:05.300
{\an3}What?

23:05.384 --> 23:07.969
Look, you need a place to stay.

23:08.053 --> 23:11.264
I have a room.
You still have your key?

23:14.601 --> 23:15.685
I don't believe you.

23:16.937 --> 23:19.981
Yesterday, you-you practically
kicked me out of the apartment,

23:20.065 --> 23:22.317
and what, now you want me
to move back in?

23:22.400 --> 23:23.318
That was yesterday.

23:23.401 --> 23:25.278
Today you're in trouble,
and I want to help you.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.322
I don't need your help.

23:27.405 --> 23:30.659
David, you can't sleep
in your car.

23:30.742 --> 23:34.329
Where I sleep and what I do is
my business, all right?

23:34.413 --> 23:35.539
Not yours.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.299
(sighs)

23:48.760 --> 23:50.804
(knocking)

23:50.887 --> 23:52.889
Yeah, yeah, keep your pants on.

23:53.890 --> 23:55.809
God, you bastard!

23:55.892 --> 23:57.394
{\an5}What's the matter
with you?
I can't believe you!

23:57.477 --> 23:58.645
Hey, that's enough!

23:58.728 --> 24:00.647
What's this about?

24:00.730 --> 24:02.482
{\an1}(grunts)
You do that one more time,

24:02.566 --> 24:04.401
I'm gonna slap you right back,
you hear me?

24:04.484 --> 24:05.861
You know what? Maybe you should.

24:05.944 --> 24:07.529
Maybe that'll knock some sense
into me!

24:07.612 --> 24:09.239
God, all this time
I believed your lies.

24:09.322 --> 24:10.323
What are you talking about,
my lies?

24:10.407 --> 24:11.366
You, your money.

24:11.449 --> 24:12.742
You're loaded, aren't you?

24:12.826 --> 24:14.911
So tell me,
how rich is rich, huh?

24:14.995 --> 24:15.996
Did Brandon tell you?

24:16.079 --> 24:16.955
Brandon knew?

24:17.831 --> 24:20.876
No, he kept
your nasty little secret.

24:20.959 --> 24:22.085
God!

24:22.169 --> 24:24.713
I didn't think it was any of
your business and I still don't.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.256
But you made it David's
business, didn't you?

24:26.339 --> 24:27.549
I mean, you bailed him out,
right?

24:27.632 --> 24:29.509
He doesn't know
anything about that, okay?

24:29.593 --> 24:30.552
Unless you tell him.

24:30.635 --> 24:32.304
You can count on it.

24:32.387 --> 24:34.222
{\an3}You see,
I want people

24:34.306 --> 24:36.349
{\an3}to like me for who
I am, and you...

24:36.433 --> 24:38.351
I liked you for who you were.

24:38.435 --> 24:39.895
You didn't act like it.

24:39.978 --> 24:42.564
And how about the way
you acted, huh?

24:42.647 --> 24:44.733
All high and mighty
about <i> my</i> lying?

24:44.816 --> 24:45.734
Well, who's the liar now?

24:45.817 --> 24:46.735
Look, it's complicated.

24:46.818 --> 24:47.777
I got a lot of things
to figure out right now.

24:47.861 --> 24:50.363
You know what? All I keep
hearing is about a guy

24:50.447 --> 24:51.573
who can't even tell himself
the truth.

24:52.532 --> 24:54.367
Save the explanations for Donna.

24:54.451 --> 24:58.163
She's not gonna be happy
about your lying either.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.099
You were here this morning.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.435
{\an1}And you want
to see the doctor again?

25:20.519 --> 25:22.062
Yes.

25:22.145 --> 25:23.939
He's just about through
for the day.

25:27.943 --> 25:30.278
Wait, Miss...!
Excuse me!

25:30.362 --> 25:32.447
Hi, I'm Kelly Taylor.

25:32.530 --> 25:34.449
Oh, hi, yeah. It's okay.

25:34.532 --> 25:35.617
You're from the Foundation.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.535
{\an1}You-you came in,
you brought the girl in

25:37.619 --> 25:38.662
{\an1}for the antibiotic earlier?
Right.

25:38.745 --> 25:41.248
{\an6}Right. I'll be with you
in just a second.
Okay.

25:41.331 --> 25:44.125
{\an3}This young man has
a stomachache, right?

25:44.209 --> 25:45.502
Can you tell me
where it hurts?

25:45.585 --> 25:48.922
{\an3}Hmm? Right there,
right there?

25:49.005 --> 25:50.632
{\an3}Well, let's take
a listen.

25:50.715 --> 25:53.468
Hmm. Can you cough?

25:53.551 --> 25:54.469
(coughs)

25:54.552 --> 25:55.470
Good. Again.

25:55.553 --> 25:56.930
{\an3}Yeah.

25:57.013 --> 25:59.015
So what have you been doing
at the Foundation?

25:59.099 --> 26:03.144
Oh, I've been, uh, sort of
rotating through different jobs.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.981
But I was thinking you could use
a good administrator.

26:06.064 --> 26:09.943
What I could use is someone
to comfort these people.

26:11.111 --> 26:13.321
{\an3}It's just indigestion.
Keep him on a bland diet,

26:13.405 --> 26:14.698
he'll be okay. Huh?

26:14.781 --> 26:17.242
{\an3}Give me five.
(chuckles)

26:22.247 --> 26:23.790
{\an1}They're scared
when they come in here.

26:23.873 --> 26:24.666
{\an1}They don't understand
what's wrong with them.

26:24.749 --> 26:26.126
The paperwork's confusing.

26:26.209 --> 26:27.544
Some of them
don't even speak English.

26:27.627 --> 26:29.504
They need reassurance.

26:29.587 --> 26:31.965
I can give them that.

26:32.048 --> 26:32.966
Or I can try.

26:33.049 --> 26:34.092
When can you start?

26:34.175 --> 26:36.720
I just have to clear it
with the Foundation higher-ups.

26:36.803 --> 26:37.804
Maybe later this week.

26:37.887 --> 26:38.680
I'll see you then.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.015
Great.

26:40.098 --> 26:42.017
Welcome to hell. (chuckles)

26:42.100 --> 26:43.643
Thanks.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.149
So, what was her name?

26:50.900 --> 26:51.735
Who, her?

26:51.818 --> 26:54.154
{\an3}No, the girl
you got pregnant.

26:54.237 --> 26:56.031
{\an3}I mean I can put two
and two together.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.408
Or in this case, one and one.

26:58.491 --> 26:59.909
Look, slow down, Dad.

26:59.993 --> 27:03.079
I don't <i> know</i> that I got
her pregnant, okay?

27:05.957 --> 27:08.043
Her name's Jodi.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.508
So what are you planning

27:15.592 --> 27:17.552
on doing about Jodi?

27:19.346 --> 27:22.432
{\an3}Well, she wants me
to participate.

27:22.515 --> 27:25.101
I told her that
it wasn't practical for me.

27:25.185 --> 27:26.394
{\an1}Hmm.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.521
Well, she's right,
and you're wrong.

27:28.605 --> 27:30.231
I hardly know her.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.359
I hardly knew your birth mother.

27:32.442 --> 27:34.736
Which is why you bolted
when you got her pregnant.

27:34.819 --> 27:37.572
Mm. I took responsibility
for you.

27:37.655 --> 27:39.199
Yeah, when? Right away?

27:39.282 --> 27:40.658
I don't think so.

27:40.742 --> 27:41.951
(sighs)

27:42.035 --> 27:44.662
It took a few weeks, sure.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.123
I don't blame you
for needing the same.

27:47.207 --> 27:48.375
A few weeks?

27:48.458 --> 27:51.753
It's gonna take a lot more
than that.

27:51.836 --> 27:53.421
My life's over, Dad.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.590
You only think so now.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.385
But from where I sit,

27:58.468 --> 28:02.597
getting your birth mother
pregnant...

28:02.680 --> 28:04.557
the best thing
that ever happened to me.

28:04.641 --> 28:07.352
Because I've got you.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.563
(dialing tones)

28:12.857 --> 28:14.609
(knocking at door)

28:14.692 --> 28:17.195
{\an5}RECORDING:
It's Noah. Leave a message,
and I might return.

28:19.697 --> 28:20.615
{\an3}Bad time?

28:20.698 --> 28:22.575
No. Hi, I just...

28:22.659 --> 28:23.576
um...

28:23.660 --> 28:24.911
You got a date
or something?

28:24.994 --> 28:26.663
Depends.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.166
I'm a pretty secretive guy.

28:30.250 --> 28:34.671
I have a hard time opening up,
I stop by without calling,

28:34.754 --> 28:36.506
I love hot Indian food,

28:36.589 --> 28:38.591
and, uh, I always say
what's on my mind.

28:38.675 --> 28:39.968
No, you don't.

28:40.051 --> 28:41.636
{\an1}What?

28:41.719 --> 28:44.639
Say what's on your mind.

28:44.722 --> 28:46.808
Dinner.

28:46.891 --> 28:48.143
Dinner?

28:48.226 --> 28:49.477
And probably dessert.

28:49.561 --> 28:52.605
So if what happened
before, you know,

28:52.689 --> 28:55.275
was just an accident,
what would this be?

28:55.358 --> 28:57.485
Deliberate, pre-meditated.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.195
Full of possibilities.

28:59.279 --> 29:01.364
That's fair.

29:02.740 --> 29:04.325
{\an1}There's something else
on my mind.

29:04.409 --> 29:05.994
What?

29:06.077 --> 29:08.997
I'm not as broke
as I made it seem.

29:14.419 --> 29:16.504
(phone rattles in cradle)

29:16.588 --> 29:18.339
What exactly does that mean?

29:18.423 --> 29:19.632
I'm one of the Hunters.

29:20.967 --> 29:22.177
Hunter Oil?

29:22.260 --> 29:23.970
That's my family.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.641
Is this some kind of joke?

29:28.725 --> 29:29.726
No, it's not.

29:29.809 --> 29:32.979
So, what? You... you've just
been lying to all of us?

29:33.062 --> 29:35.690
{\an3}(chuckles) What did you
expect me to say?

29:35.773 --> 29:38.985
Couldn't you just have been
honest with me?

29:39.068 --> 29:40.403
I was trying to.

29:40.487 --> 29:42.989
I was running away. I wanted
to see what it'd be like

29:43.072 --> 29:44.532
to be someone other
than Noah Hunter.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.576
Believe me,

29:46.659 --> 29:48.203
it's a long, confused list.

29:51.623 --> 29:52.999
Do you like chicken vindaloo?

29:54.626 --> 29:55.877
It's Indian food.

29:55.960 --> 29:59.547
Kind of a peace offering.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.216
With hot chilies?

30:01.299 --> 30:03.092
Is there any other kind?

30:03.176 --> 30:05.178
Mm. You're buying.

30:12.310 --> 30:13.520
{\an1}DAVID:
Um...

30:13.603 --> 30:15.522
I was, I was planning
on calling you.

30:15.605 --> 30:17.065
{\an3}JILL: Let me guess,
your phone book

30:17.148 --> 30:18.816
got burned in the fire?

30:19.984 --> 30:22.362
Well, it could have.

30:24.280 --> 30:26.282
The fire marshal says
he hasn't been informed

30:26.366 --> 30:28.243
which insurance company
to file his report with.

30:28.326 --> 30:30.912
{\an1}NAT: You know, there's really
not that much damage

30:30.995 --> 30:34.916
here-- probably wouldn't be more
than the deductible.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.543
Let's cut to it, shall we?!

30:36.626 --> 30:38.586
You have no insurance.
You can't pay for repairs.

30:38.670 --> 30:39.587
You're always

30:39.671 --> 30:41.130
behind on your rent.

30:41.214 --> 30:43.591
And your lease is up.

30:45.677 --> 30:46.469
I can do better.

30:46.553 --> 30:50.181
And I'm sure you will...
somewhere else.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.446
{\an1}VALERIE:
Brandon...

31:05.530 --> 31:07.907
you knew the whole time?
About Noah?

31:07.991 --> 31:09.450
When did you find out?

31:09.534 --> 31:10.785
What difference
does that make?

31:10.868 --> 31:12.912
You want a prize
for keeping me in the dark?

31:12.996 --> 31:14.497
It wasn't like that, Val.

31:14.581 --> 31:16.791
{\an1}You knew
I lost my money!

31:16.874 --> 31:20.795
Look, Brandon, look, you knew
how I felt about Noah.

31:20.878 --> 31:23.590
Brandon?

31:23.673 --> 31:26.301
{\an1}Look, you know
what this meant to me.

31:26.384 --> 31:28.469
{\an3}Is this about him,
or is this about you?

31:28.553 --> 31:30.346
You made me look
like an idiot, okay?

31:30.430 --> 31:31.514
Thanks for nothing.

31:42.567 --> 31:43.860
{\an3}What was Valerie
bagging about?

31:43.943 --> 31:45.486
{\an1}She's just trying
to blame me

31:45.570 --> 31:46.779
for her two-timing Noah.

31:46.863 --> 31:47.989
Oh, that makes sense.

31:48.072 --> 31:49.115
Yeah.

31:49.198 --> 31:50.617
Oh, I forgot
to tell you.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.201
Um, I'm gonna be moving

31:52.285 --> 31:53.661
to a new position
at the Foundation.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.663
{\an3}I'm gonna be helping out
at a free clinic.

31:55.747 --> 31:56.664
That sounds exciting.

31:56.748 --> 31:57.999
Congratulations.

31:58.082 --> 32:00.168
{\an3}Thanks.
Now, Brandon,

32:00.251 --> 32:04.005
I think that you should talk to
Erica about her helping you.

32:04.088 --> 32:06.674
{\an1}Kel, it's the end
of a very long day.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.384
{\an1}I don't want to
have another fight.

32:08.468 --> 32:11.012
What do you want?

32:13.264 --> 32:16.142
Riggs in jail
with the key thrown away.

32:16.225 --> 32:18.519
You can do that.

32:18.603 --> 32:21.064
Sure, by catching him
in the act...

32:21.147 --> 32:23.483
having the police arrest him
on a different charge.

32:23.566 --> 32:25.735
That you can't do.

32:25.818 --> 32:26.861
Sure, he can.

32:26.944 --> 32:29.238
{\an3}I thought
you were sleeping.

32:29.322 --> 32:31.532
All you have to do is gain
his trust.

32:31.616 --> 32:32.533
And how do I do that?

32:32.617 --> 32:34.452
By using me.

32:38.164 --> 32:39.582
(knocking)

32:42.669 --> 32:46.214
{\an3}Hi. Uh, come on in.
I'm putting Zach to bed.

32:47.799 --> 32:48.716
Steve?

32:48.800 --> 32:52.220
Carly, I'm gonna do it...

32:53.638 --> 32:55.556
...if-if it's mine.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.518
I'm gonna take responsibility.

32:58.601 --> 33:01.062
Be a real father.

33:01.145 --> 33:02.855
{\an3}ZACH:
Mom!

33:02.939 --> 33:03.940
In a second, honey.

33:04.023 --> 33:05.858
Why don't you go brush
your teeth?

33:05.942 --> 33:10.363
I know this may hurt
what you and I have.

33:10.446 --> 33:12.073
{\an3}Mom!

33:12.156 --> 33:14.575
{\an1}God knows you have
a lot on your plate.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.911
So I... I'd certainly understand

33:16.994 --> 33:19.205
if you didn't want
to be a part of this.

33:19.288 --> 33:20.248
But I do.

33:20.331 --> 33:21.416
You do?

33:21.499 --> 33:23.209
Yeah.

33:23.292 --> 33:26.671
Oh.

33:28.840 --> 33:29.632
Mom.

33:31.134 --> 33:32.468
Can you finish the story?

33:32.552 --> 33:35.388
{\an1}You better
finish that story.

33:35.471 --> 33:36.431
Give me a few?

33:36.514 --> 33:38.266
{\an1}You'll be there
with me tomorrow?

33:38.349 --> 33:39.434
The doctor's office?

33:39.517 --> 33:41.394
I wouldn't be anywhere else.

33:43.563 --> 33:45.606
{\an3}Come on.

33:50.069 --> 33:51.237
It wasn't too hot.

33:51.320 --> 33:53.239
{\an3}Oh, yeah? I saw
your eyes watering.

33:53.322 --> 33:54.449
It wasn't the vindaloo.

33:54.532 --> 33:55.825
It was... something
you said moved me.

33:55.908 --> 33:57.285
{\an3}Oh, right.

33:57.368 --> 33:59.245
{\an1}But I was thinking
about your eyes, too.

33:59.328 --> 34:01.622
Uh-huh? Nice save.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.750
{\an3}You know, I'm glad you were
honest about the money.

34:03.833 --> 34:06.544
It must have been tough.

34:06.627 --> 34:08.629
{\an3}I had a really
nice time tonight.

34:08.713 --> 34:11.340
So did I. In a deliberate,
pre-meditated kind of way.

34:11.424 --> 34:12.632
{\an3}(laughs)

34:12.717 --> 34:14.092
Is there any other kind?

34:14.177 --> 34:15.803
Not anymore.

34:29.233 --> 34:30.275
Good night.

34:30.359 --> 34:32.360
Good night.

34:45.958 --> 34:46.876
Hi.

34:46.958 --> 34:48.668
{\an3}(gasps)

34:48.753 --> 34:51.547
{\an3}David, what-what
are you doing here?

34:54.592 --> 34:56.427
Um...

34:56.511 --> 34:58.679
{\an1}I was trying to get
a good night's sleep.

34:58.763 --> 35:01.724
{\an3}I thought you said you
weren't coming here tonight.

35:04.268 --> 35:06.395
I kind of wish I hadn't.

35:10.441 --> 35:12.527
I'm sorry you had to see that.

35:12.610 --> 35:15.613
Not half as sorry as I am.

35:32.046 --> 35:33.714
(laughs)

35:33.798 --> 35:35.132
Please don't be mad at me.

35:35.216 --> 35:36.676
{\an1}I really couldn't handle
you being mad at me.

35:36.759 --> 35:39.512
{\an3}Well, I guess that depends
on where you've been.

35:39.595 --> 35:41.556
{\an3}And how much money
you've made me.

35:41.639 --> 35:42.765
Come on.

35:42.849 --> 35:44.767
I was in Las Vegas.
Uh-huh?

35:44.851 --> 35:46.352
{\an1}And I suppose
I should have called.

35:46.435 --> 35:48.229
Yeah, you're damn right
you should have called.

35:48.312 --> 35:49.480
ERICA (over wire):
Look, I made out pretty good.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.440
RIGGS: Oh, really? That's what
you always say, sweet thing.

35:51.524 --> 35:53.234
And you're always lying to me.

35:53.317 --> 35:55.027
ERICA: Look, this time it's
true, okay? Honest.

35:55.111 --> 35:57.071
{\an3}We never should have agreed
to do this. He's hurting her.

35:57.154 --> 35:58.573
We've got her covered.

35:58.656 --> 36:01.075
{\an6}BRANDON:
We didn't really have
much of a choice, Kel.

36:01.158 --> 36:03.244
This way, Riggs'll think
Erica's been arrested, as well.

36:03.327 --> 36:04.704
{\an1}The only people testifying
against her in court

36:04.787 --> 36:05.913
will be the detectives.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.540
KELLY:
So we're

36:07.623 --> 36:08.416
{\an3}protecting her?
Yes.

36:08.499 --> 36:11.294
{\an3}Then why are we
putting her in danger?

36:11.377 --> 36:14.755
RIGGS:
Good, let's see it.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.841
{\an3}Take it.

36:18.509 --> 36:19.760
(mutters)

36:22.471 --> 36:24.932
Whoa. Not bad.
Mm-hmm.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.434
Hey, maybe all your
little girlfriends

36:26.517 --> 36:27.977
have been wrong about you.

36:28.060 --> 36:29.103
And another thing.

36:29.186 --> 36:33.232
{\an3}This guy, the one over
there, he does major crack.

36:33.316 --> 36:36.235
RIGGS:
Oh, yeah? Where'd you find him?

36:36.319 --> 36:38.237
{\an5}ERICA:
Coming out of some club
on Santa Monica.

36:38.321 --> 36:41.699
We went to party.
Please talk to my friend.

36:41.782 --> 36:42.950
{\an1}(laughs)

36:43.034 --> 36:44.744
You know, it's a good
thing you're pretty,

36:44.827 --> 36:46.287
{\an1}because you're one
bad-tempered little thing.

36:46.370 --> 36:47.914
Come on. Introduce me to him.

36:49.373 --> 36:51.292
{\an5}Walk him over to the car, go on.
BRANDON:
All right

36:51.375 --> 36:52.919
{\an1}You've got him on
possession. If he solicits,

36:53.002 --> 36:54.086
{\an1}you get him
on dealing, too, right?

36:54.170 --> 36:56.631
Yeah, not only drugs, but maybe
a concealed weapon, too.

36:56.714 --> 36:58.466
{\an3}Wait, you think he's
carrying a gun?

36:58.549 --> 37:01.552
The more we get him on,
the longer he goes away.

37:01.636 --> 37:04.138
If she's hurt...

37:04.221 --> 37:05.973
{\an3}PATE: Don't worry. The guy
behind the cocaine

37:06.057 --> 37:07.600
{\an3}is the best
detective we have.

37:09.018 --> 37:11.312
Hi.

37:11.395 --> 37:13.814
{\an3}I understand you're
looking to connect, huh?

37:13.898 --> 37:15.942
I really need a couple of dimes.
You holding?

37:16.025 --> 37:19.111
{\an3}Oh, you're buying,
I'm selling.

37:20.738 --> 37:21.989
Here you go.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.407
Looks good. How much?

37:23.491 --> 37:26.202
We're talking a
Franklin here.

37:26.285 --> 37:27.203
My favorite president.

37:27.286 --> 37:28.996
{\an3}Good.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.498
Here you go, my friend.
<i>Gracias, amigos.</i>

37:30.581 --> 37:31.332
All right, now!

37:31.415 --> 37:32.375
(tires squealing)

37:32.458 --> 37:34.001
(siren wailing)

37:39.590 --> 37:41.217
Hold it!

37:42.385 --> 37:44.345
Hands in the air!
Come on. What?

37:44.428 --> 37:46.389
{\an4}OFFICER:
Freeze! Don't move!
What's going on?

37:46.472 --> 37:47.807
(indistinct voices)

37:47.890 --> 37:50.893
{\an1}You're under arrest
for possession with intent

37:50.977 --> 37:53.354
{\an6}to distribute.
What?
What's going on?

37:55.398 --> 37:57.400
{\an5}PATE:
Get her in!
Get in the car. Come on.

37:57.483 --> 38:00.569
Riggs, don't leave me!
Riggs!

38:00.653 --> 38:03.030
Hey, it's all right, honey.
Don't worry about it.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.449
Everything's gonna be fine.
Come on, take it easy.

38:07.535 --> 38:11.539
PATE: Al, call it in. Code four.
Suspect's in custody.

38:14.458 --> 38:16.419
(siren wails)

38:21.590 --> 38:23.217
Come on, sweetie.

38:23.300 --> 38:25.344
{\an1}You okay?

38:26.470 --> 38:27.763
You think he bought it?

38:27.847 --> 38:30.558
Yeah. You did good.

38:40.443 --> 38:43.195
{\an1}Mr. Sanders.
Miss...?

38:43.279 --> 38:44.405
Reynolds.

38:44.488 --> 38:47.450
We have the results of the
DNA testing for Jodi Carlyle.

38:48.492 --> 38:49.910
And?

38:50.703 --> 38:51.746
It's negative.

38:51.829 --> 38:53.414
(exclaiming)

38:53.497 --> 38:54.457
{\an3}Ah!

38:54.540 --> 38:56.584
Yes.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.586
You have only
a one in five billion chance

38:58.669 --> 39:00.421
of being the father.
I'm not the father?

39:00.504 --> 39:02.048
No. You're not.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.927
Thank you so much.

39:07.011 --> 39:10.014
If you have any more questions,
I'll be down the hall.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.434
It's over.

39:13.517 --> 39:14.810
No.

39:14.894 --> 39:17.730
A little something
I've got to talk to Jodi about.

39:17.813 --> 39:19.315
{\an1}Come on.

39:28.908 --> 39:31.619
You look like hell.

39:31.702 --> 39:34.955
{\an1}Funny, that's exactly
where I've been.

39:35.039 --> 39:37.583
You know, I never noticed
Noah's pitchfork before.

39:37.666 --> 39:39.126
You were on the boat?

39:39.210 --> 39:40.336
Hmm. The apartment.

39:40.419 --> 39:42.296
Donna offered me a room.

39:42.379 --> 39:45.174
{\an1}Unfortunately, she offered
Noah everything else.

39:45.257 --> 39:46.300
You know, seeing them kiss?

39:46.384 --> 39:48.427
That I didn't need.

39:48.511 --> 39:50.096
Well, it gets worse.

39:50.179 --> 39:52.681
That's not possible.

39:52.765 --> 39:54.975
Noah was the one
who paid off your loan.

39:56.769 --> 39:58.145
Noah?

40:00.856 --> 40:02.316
No way.

40:02.399 --> 40:03.943
Way. Way, way.

40:04.026 --> 40:05.569
{\an3}Apparently he's a
bit better off

40:05.653 --> 40:07.363
than he led us to believe.

40:07.446 --> 40:09.323
Millions better off.

40:09.406 --> 40:10.699
You're serious.

40:13.536 --> 40:16.664
So, he steals my girl and saves
my butt at the same time?

40:16.747 --> 40:18.499
Maybe he thought
it would soften the blow.

40:18.582 --> 40:21.544
Well, I'm gonna go
let him know it didn't.

40:27.424 --> 40:29.426
(knocking at door)

40:29.510 --> 40:31.011
{\an3}She's here.

40:33.139 --> 40:34.306
{\an3}Hi.
Hi.

40:34.390 --> 40:36.392
{\an3}Come in.

40:38.227 --> 40:39.520
{\an3}I heard.

40:39.603 --> 40:42.356
Congratulations, I guess.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.360
{\an1}What are you going
to do about the kid?

40:46.443 --> 40:49.989
I'm going to be a good mom.

40:51.824 --> 40:56.412
You know, Jodi, you let me think
I was the only guy.

40:56.495 --> 41:01.250
Well, there was someone else
just before I met you.

41:01.333 --> 41:05.379
I can't believe you lied
about something so important.

41:05.462 --> 41:07.214
I... I can't believe that.

41:07.298 --> 41:10.176
He was okay, I guess,

41:10.259 --> 41:13.220
but I was hoping that you
would turn out to be the guy.

41:13.304 --> 41:15.222
That's no excuse
for putting me through hell.

41:15.306 --> 41:16.348
I'm sorry.

41:16.432 --> 41:18.517
You should be.

41:20.019 --> 41:21.562
Are you going
to tell the real father?

41:21.645 --> 41:24.523
Yeah.

41:25.316 --> 41:27.234
{\an1}Look, Steve...
Look...

41:27.318 --> 41:29.904
let's just hope
he does the right thing.

41:29.987 --> 41:31.280
For the kid's sake.

41:31.363 --> 41:34.658
Yeah, I hope he does, too.

41:45.336 --> 41:46.962
(door closes)

41:52.760 --> 41:54.220
(sighs)

42:03.854 --> 42:06.106
Ready.

42:06.190 --> 42:07.107
{\an3}KELLY: So, you've got
everything?

42:07.191 --> 42:08.192
Passport...

42:08.275 --> 42:12.446
{\an1}tickets... and a pretty
incredible story for Dylan.

42:12.529 --> 42:13.948
{\an3}Well, it's not
exactly a fairy tale,

42:14.031 --> 42:15.449
{\an3}but at least it
has a happy ending.

42:15.532 --> 42:17.451
Yeah, thanks to you guys.

42:17.534 --> 42:19.954
Please, if it wasn't for you,
I'd be in prison right now.

42:22.581 --> 42:26.043
You know, no one's ever stood up
for me like that before.

42:26.126 --> 42:28.128
I'll never forget it.

42:30.547 --> 42:33.467
We've got to get going.

42:37.888 --> 42:38.889
{\an3}Brandon?
Hmm?

42:38.973 --> 42:40.057
{\an3}If things
hadn't worked out,

42:40.140 --> 42:41.600
{\an3}would you have gone
to jail for her?

42:41.684 --> 42:44.645
{\an1}That depends if I could have
gotten conjugal visits or not.

42:47.398 --> 42:49.984
Donna, hey.

42:50.067 --> 42:52.361
Hey.

42:52.444 --> 42:54.446
{\an3}Is, uh... is Noah
here with you?

42:54.530 --> 42:55.948
Um...

42:56.031 --> 42:57.199
Hey, Donna.

42:57.283 --> 42:58.617
David, I want to talk to you.

42:58.701 --> 43:00.828
Noah, hey.
(chuckles)

43:00.911 --> 43:02.705
I didn't ask for your help.

43:02.788 --> 43:05.291
{\an3}You were in trouble. I was
trying to help you, man.

43:05.374 --> 43:07.835
You're a real friend.

43:07.918 --> 43:10.337
{\an3}The point is, you're
back in business.

43:10.421 --> 43:13.299
{\an1}No, I'm back in business until
my lease expires next week.

43:13.382 --> 43:16.343
You got an indefinite
extension, believe me.

43:16.427 --> 43:18.387
Wait a second, you didn't...

43:18.470 --> 43:19.430
Buy her out?

43:19.513 --> 43:21.348
I made her an offer.
You know what I'm saying?

43:21.432 --> 43:23.517
What do you think, you can just
take Donna from me and then

43:23.600 --> 43:25.311
{\an5}make everything all right by
NOAH:
That's not the way it happened.

43:25.394 --> 43:27.521
throwing your money around?
You guys, calm down, okay?

43:27.605 --> 43:29.106
Don't worry about me.

43:29.189 --> 43:30.316
Run your club.

43:34.945 --> 43:37.031
You know what?

43:37.114 --> 43:38.699
I don't want to run the club.

43:38.782 --> 43:40.326
You run it.

43:40.409 --> 43:42.036
{\an1}DONNA:
David?

43:43.620 --> 43:45.080
What just happened?

43:45.164 --> 43:47.333
Just what I was afraid of.
My money is ruining everything.

43:47.416 --> 43:49.418
Noah!

43:52.463 --> 43:54.882
(sighs)
