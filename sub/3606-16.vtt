00:00.301 --> 00:04.870
Kara: <i> When I was a child,</i>
<i> my planet Krypton was dying.</i>

00:04.872 --> 00:08.340
<i> I was sent to earth</i>
<i> to protect my cousin.</i>

00:08.342 --> 00:10.309
<i> But my pod got</i>
<i> knocked off-course</i>

00:10.311 --> 00:12.044
<i> and by the time I got here,</i>

00:12.046 --> 00:15.948
<i> my cousin</i>
<i> had already grown up</i>
<i> and become superman.</i>

00:15.950 --> 00:18.050
<i> And so I hid my powers</i>

00:18.052 --> 00:22.287
<i> until recently when</i>
<i> an accident forced me to</i>
<i> reveal myself to the world.</i>

00:22.289 --> 00:26.091
<i> To most people</i>
<i> I'm an assistant</i>
<i> at catco worldwide media.</i>

00:26.093 --> 00:29.628
<i> But in secret, I work with my</i>
<i> adoptive sister for the deo</i>

00:29.630 --> 00:31.563
<i> to protect my city</i>
<i> from alien life</i>

00:31.565 --> 00:34.366
<i> and anyone else</i>
<i> that means to cause it harm.</i>

00:35.636 --> 00:38.370
<i> I am Supergirl.</i>

00:38.372 --> 00:40.305
Cat:
<i> Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:40.307 --> 00:43.275
Hank didn't kill astra.
I did.

00:43.277 --> 00:46.712
Supergirl, she apprehended
my attacker and saving

00:46.714 --> 00:48.247
who knows how many lives.

00:48.249 --> 00:51.450
Assistant number one,
meet assistant number two.

00:51.452 --> 00:52.551
I'm two?

00:52.553 --> 00:54.686
Most people will
wanna be there for you.

00:55.990 --> 00:57.656
Lucy caught me lying.

00:57.658 --> 01:00.125
I need to be able
to tell her that
you are Supergirl.

01:00.127 --> 01:02.728
This is over, James.
You love her.

01:02.730 --> 01:05.397
And for what it's worth,
she feels the same.

01:05.399 --> 01:08.834
They say Supergirl's
not the only alien
inside deo.

01:08.836 --> 01:11.370
You are the greatest
asset that we have.

01:11.372 --> 01:13.705
I can't be in the deo
if I am an alien.

01:16.377 --> 01:19.878
She's the founder
and ceo of a media empire

01:19.880 --> 01:21.947
who was recently
named number one

01:21.949 --> 01:25.717
on the national city tribune's
annual power list.

01:25.719 --> 01:28.887
Please welcome
our next guest,
cat Grant!

01:28.889 --> 01:30.589
(Applause)

01:30.591 --> 01:34.526
Wow, you look
so much younger than
i thought you would!

01:34.528 --> 01:37.129
-Mmm. So do you.
-(Audience cheering)

01:37.131 --> 01:40.966
Cat, how does it feel
to be the most powerful
woman in national city?

01:40.968 --> 01:43.836
Well, Sara, first of all,
that's a total misnomer.

01:43.838 --> 01:47.072
Nobody is calling me
the most powerful woman
in national city.

01:47.074 --> 01:50.342
I believe they are calling me
the most powerful person.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.646
Having a platform like mine
is only worthwhile

01:54.648 --> 01:57.816
if I can use it
to bring attention
to the people who are

01:57.818 --> 01:59.852
really making a difference.

01:59.854 --> 02:02.621
-Well, cat, that brings us
to our next question.
-Supergirl.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.456
You've been
associated with her
since she first emerged

02:04.458 --> 02:06.058
on the national
city scene.

02:06.060 --> 02:08.594
And you've been a critic,
you've been a cheerleader

02:08.596 --> 02:11.697
and some say
that you are a friend.

02:11.699 --> 02:13.098
Well, I would
like to think so.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.333
-What is she like?
-Yeah.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.068
Supergirl is everything
you think she is.

02:16.070 --> 02:17.503
She's strong,
she's brave.

02:17.505 --> 02:20.005
<i> But the most remarkable</i>
<i> thing about Supergirl is</i>

02:20.007 --> 02:23.342
<i> that she is the</i>
<i> kindest person</i>
<i> I have ever known.</i>

02:23.344 --> 02:25.310
Mean girl: So, you think
you're Supergirl?

02:25.312 --> 02:27.312
If I shoved you,
could you fly?

02:27.314 --> 02:28.680
(All laughing)

02:29.817 --> 02:32.451
You look so stupid.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.486
-No, I don't.
-Everybody thinks so.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.889
That's why you
don't have any friends.

02:36.891 --> 02:38.557
I wouldn't say that.

02:38.559 --> 02:41.426
I actually think
you look pretty awesome.

02:41.428 --> 02:43.195
Thanks.

02:43.197 --> 02:45.364
-Laura.
-You know Supergirl?

02:45.366 --> 02:48.167
Yeah. I'm friends
with all the nice girls.

02:48.169 --> 02:49.835
See you later.

02:49.837 --> 02:54.439
<i> She is an idea,</i>
<i> she's inspiring us to be</i>
<i> our best selves.</i>

02:54.441 --> 02:57.376
<i> Now, we can learn</i>
<i> a lot from her.</i>

02:57.378 --> 03:00.312
<i> You can learn</i>
<i> a lot from her.</i>

03:00.314 --> 03:02.648
<i> I have learned</i>
<i> a lot from her.</i>

03:02.650 --> 03:04.783
<i> -And I'm still learning.</i>
-(Applause on TV)

03:04.785 --> 03:06.818
-Enraptured, are we?
-Oh, Ms. Grant.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.387
I was really fabulous.

03:08.389 --> 03:11.456
God knows I hate
a generic sports metaphor,

03:11.458 --> 03:13.725
but that interview
was a touchdown.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.227
A home run.

03:15.229 --> 03:16.895
Whatever you call it
when you do something
good in hockey.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.063
Where is my
computer droid?

03:18.065 --> 03:20.532
Winn? He's, um...

03:21.802 --> 03:24.536
I will find him.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.738
I really need
to rethink this necklace.

03:26.740 --> 03:27.940
Winn?

03:33.013 --> 03:34.613
Winn!

03:34.615 --> 03:36.281
(Thudding)

03:40.821 --> 03:42.955
Winn, are you in...

03:43.824 --> 03:45.257
(Thudding continues)

03:48.629 --> 03:49.561
(Gasping)

03:49.563 --> 03:53.131
No! No!
No, no, no, no, no!

03:53.133 --> 03:54.600
(Grunting)

03:55.302 --> 03:57.302
Guess that's my exit.

03:57.304 --> 03:58.637
(Sighing)

04:00.307 --> 04:02.841
You didn't just
now use the...

04:02.843 --> 04:06.144
-Oh, god you did.
You did.
-(Groaning)

04:06.146 --> 04:09.915
I'm never using supplies
from that closet ever again
without surgical gloves.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.250
Okay, okay.

04:11.252 --> 04:12.985
Look, I'm, I'm...

04:12.987 --> 04:16.188
I'm sorry, I did not mean
for any of this to happen.

04:16.190 --> 04:17.956
It's just kind of happening.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.459
(Chuckling)
And, like, I know it
seems wrong,

04:20.461 --> 04:22.728
I mean, it definitely,
it feels wrong,

04:22.730 --> 04:24.596
except for, like,
when it's happening
and then it's like...

04:24.598 --> 04:27.366
Okay, okay.
You don't have
to explain anything, winn.

04:27.368 --> 04:30.202
You're both
two consenting adults.

04:30.204 --> 04:31.903
You should do what
makes you happy.

04:31.905 --> 04:32.938
Cat: Ker-rah!

04:32.940 --> 04:34.273
Ker-rah!

04:34.275 --> 04:35.774
If I have to say your
name a third time,

04:35.776 --> 04:37.909
you will have
to find another job.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.044
Duty calls.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.612
You... you missed a button.

04:55.296 --> 04:59.164
Um, Ms. Grant
just told me...

04:59.166 --> 05:01.166
Lucy quit.

05:01.168 --> 05:04.236
You told her I was Supergirl
and she left the city?

05:04.238 --> 05:05.971
No, I didn't tell her.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.606
-You didn't?
-No.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.441
She broke up
with me before I had
a chance to, so...

05:13.180 --> 05:15.047
But, why?

05:15.048 --> 05:16.915
Because you stood
her up when we went to
the fortress of solitude.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.785
-No, no...
Yeah, I know you did.
-I tried to talk to her.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.119
Oh, no, did I say
something wrong?

05:21.121 --> 05:22.487
No, no, Kara.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.989
(Stammering) It wasn't that...
It wasn't...

05:25.292 --> 05:27.292
It was just something
between us.

05:27.294 --> 05:29.795
Not you and I.
Between me and Lucy.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.363
So, it didn't have
anything to do with you.

05:31.365 --> 05:32.731
Or Supergirl.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.933
It had nothing to do
with you or Supergirl.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.936
It's just obvious how much
she loves you and...

05:37.938 --> 05:40.072
I think, she knows

05:40.074 --> 05:42.007
-how much
you love her...
-Maybe I didn't.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.342
What?

05:44.611 --> 05:48.680
Maybe I didn't love her
as much as I should have.

05:48.682 --> 05:52.084
Maybe I didn't love her
as much as I thought I did.

05:53.921 --> 05:54.986
(Cell phone chimes)

05:58.058 --> 05:59.491
It's Alex.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.326
-Alex: She broke up
with him?
-Kaput.

06:01.328 --> 06:03.528
Ugh, I always knew
that relationship
was going to go busto.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.263
I feel guilty.

06:05.265 --> 06:06.365
Did he say
were the reason?

06:06.367 --> 06:07.999
He said the opposite.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.835
Well, then guilt
isn't what you should
be feeling.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.436
Try hope.

06:11.438 --> 06:13.572
I don't want to be
the rebound girl, Alex.

06:13.574 --> 06:16.842
(Sighing) He likes you,
you like him, okay?

06:16.844 --> 06:19.111
Rebound relationships,
they can work.

06:19.113 --> 06:20.545
Name one.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.914
(Exhaling)
Kim and kanye.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.583
I'm embarrassed
you even know that.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.518
Look, okay, stop.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.220
You need to embrace
what you're feeling.

06:28.222 --> 06:30.856
And be the
"let-him-know-girl" before
another Lucy Lane

06:30.858 --> 06:32.691
swoops in and
tells him first.

06:32.693 --> 06:33.859
Okay.

06:35.462 --> 06:37.529
Senator crane,

06:37.531 --> 06:38.864
it's good
to see you again.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.365
Good to see you.

06:40.367 --> 06:42.300
The senator came by
to tell us that
she's been working

06:42.302 --> 06:45.203
with the budget committee
to get the deo
more money,

06:45.205 --> 06:46.805
more resources
to fight non.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.607
-A lot more.
-Alex: That's great.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.876
We can use it.

06:50.878 --> 06:53.078
I also came by because
i wanted to personally

06:53.080 --> 06:55.347
thank director henshaw
for the amazing work

06:55.349 --> 06:57.449
he's been doing
to keep our nation,

06:57.451 --> 06:58.884
this planet, safe.

06:58.886 --> 07:01.620
Well, it's not just me,
it's my team.

07:01.622 --> 07:04.356
Well, it starts
at the top.

07:04.358 --> 07:06.425
This agency deals
with the unknown

07:06.427 --> 07:09.161
and is often forced
to make up the rules
as it goes.

07:09.163 --> 07:12.764
You don't have
the same oversight as other
branches of the military.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.567
It's important to me
that there's someone I know

07:15.569 --> 07:18.036
and trust making sure

07:18.038 --> 07:22.340
justice is meted out
in a way that's consistent
with our ideals.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.443
And I'm glad
that person is you.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.479
(Softly) Wow.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.314
Ma'am, there's
fire downtown.

07:29.316 --> 07:30.849
A fireman's trapped
on the roof.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.384
Punch it up.

07:32.386 --> 07:34.519
Supergirl, can you
get there in time?

07:35.055 --> 07:36.655
Yeah, she can.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.091
(People screaming)

07:43.263 --> 07:45.130
(Indistinct conversations)

07:46.934 --> 07:48.600
-Man: Get a hand?
-Lift this!

07:48.602 --> 07:50.535
On three,
one, two, three!

07:50.537 --> 07:52.604
(Man screaming)

07:53.373 --> 07:55.507
Supergirl, over here!

07:55.509 --> 07:57.209
-My men have the fire!
-Okay.

07:57.211 --> 07:58.643
I got ya.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.413
(Groaning)

08:01.415 --> 08:02.881
(Grunting)

08:02.883 --> 08:05.183
(Panting)
You're going to be okay.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.185
Thank you.

08:12.426 --> 08:13.758
God.

08:32.579 --> 08:34.179
(Ticking)

08:34.181 --> 08:35.647
(Ringing)

08:48.462 --> 08:50.262
(Elevator bell dinging)

08:59.373 --> 09:00.805
Morning.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.176
Morning.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.179
Kara: What?

09:08.181 --> 09:09.681
I was getting tired
of my old clothes.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.216
Yeah, we all were.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.119
Ker-rah, look at you
dressed like an adult.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.854
That's promising.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.622
Mmm.

09:17.624 --> 09:21.893
So, I demanded a list
of replacements for
Lucy Lane, like, yesterday.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.563
-Ms. Grant...
-Ah, here you are.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.431
I already checked
all their references

09:26.433 --> 09:28.633
and ranked them
according to who you'll find
the least annoying.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.902
Oh, any Republicans?

09:30.904 --> 09:33.338
-Two reformed.
-Cat: Excellent.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.574
Oh, and look at that.

09:35.576 --> 09:37.409
A reward.

09:37.411 --> 09:39.477
Someone gifted me tickets
for club apocalypse
for Friday night

09:39.479 --> 09:43.214
to see a Scandinavian dj
whose name I won't even
try to pronounce.

09:43.216 --> 09:45.784
Thank you.
I'll put them to good use.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.690
Do you even know
how to dance?

09:51.692 --> 09:53.558
Don't be jealous.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.293
Or do, I don't really care.

09:57.598 --> 10:00.332
Two armored vehicles
have been attacked
in the last six hours.

10:00.334 --> 10:03.068
Both carrying hundreds
of thousands worth in gold.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.670
Now, these two have goons
managed to take out a number

10:05.672 --> 10:08.406
of highly trained
and heavily armed
security personnel.

10:08.408 --> 10:09.774
-Alien weapons?
-Almost.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.376
An alien is their weapon.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.212
A k'hund.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.548
Stronger than your average
fort rozz escapee.

10:16.550 --> 10:20.418
Now, we've obtained
intel on their next heist,
but we have to move fast.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.921
Lucky for us,
we have an alien of our own.

10:24.891 --> 10:26.992
Hmm?

10:26.994 --> 10:29.127
I'm sorry, Supergirl,
am I boring you?

10:29.129 --> 10:30.962
Only boring people
get bored.

10:32.733 --> 10:36.301
Sorry. I thought you were
talking to some other alien
agent at the deo.

10:38.872 --> 10:41.373
All right.
Let's move,
let's move.

10:41.375 --> 10:44.075
Do I need to brief
you again or have
you got all that?

10:44.077 --> 10:46.945
Kick alien ass.

10:48.715 --> 10:51.016
They're pros.
Took out seven guys like that.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.517
Man: I heard frank's
in a coma.

10:52.519 --> 10:53.652
That's it.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.286
I'm asking for a raise.

10:57.591 --> 10:58.857
We're good to go.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.759
(Metallic squeaking)

11:01.795 --> 11:03.762
(Engine whirring)

11:06.933 --> 11:09.300
-(Metallic clanking)
-(Both groaning)

11:10.437 --> 11:12.070
(Grunting and groaning)

11:16.743 --> 11:18.276
(Groaning)

11:18.278 --> 11:20.278
(Tires screeching)

11:21.081 --> 11:22.347
Don't move!

11:22.349 --> 11:23.515
(Grunting)

11:23.517 --> 11:24.983
Supergirl, you're up.

11:31.625 --> 11:35.026
-Your mother...
-Sentenced you to fort rozz,
blah, blah, ruined your life,

11:35.028 --> 11:36.628
I've heard the story.

11:36.630 --> 11:38.229
You wanna fight about it?

11:38.231 --> 11:39.597
(Grunting)

11:39.599 --> 11:41.066
(Grunting)

11:41.702 --> 11:43.201
(Fighting grunts)

11:45.072 --> 11:47.172
Is that it?
(Laughing)

11:48.241 --> 11:50.341
(Fighting grunts)

11:53.580 --> 11:55.246
(Bone cracking)

11:55.248 --> 11:56.448
(Both grunting)

11:57.250 --> 11:58.483
(Groaning)

12:02.723 --> 12:03.855
(Chocking)

12:03.857 --> 12:06.624
I have defeated
white martians,

12:06.626 --> 12:08.893
coluans and Kryptonians.

12:08.895 --> 12:12.731
You, you're not
even worth looking at.

12:14.301 --> 12:15.600
Get out of my sight.

12:15.602 --> 12:16.868
(Gasping)

12:18.271 --> 12:19.871
Before I change my mind.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.476
(Tires screeching)

12:27.681 --> 12:29.180
Where did he go?

12:29.182 --> 12:30.248
Are you hurt?

12:30.250 --> 12:31.382
No. No, I'm fine.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.785
He got away.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.525
Director henshaw,
senator crane
is in your office.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.827
She said you were going
to update her on what
happened with the k'hund.

12:42.829 --> 12:43.628
Well, that sounds fun.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.000
Tell her I'll be there
in a minute.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.969
Can I speak with you
here for a second?

12:53.106 --> 12:55.640
I know you just started
working here again,

12:55.642 --> 12:57.175
but to be clear,

12:57.177 --> 13:00.578
our job here at the deo
is to catch the aliens,

13:00.580 --> 13:01.980
not let them escape.

13:01.982 --> 13:05.683
How 'bout you get off
my back for once, Hank?

13:05.685 --> 13:07.519
Supergirl.

13:07.521 --> 13:09.854
I thought we were
in a good place here.

13:09.856 --> 13:14.092
We're in a good place,
when I do what I'm told.

13:14.094 --> 13:16.327
When I don't,
you come down on me.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.695
I am tired of it!

13:17.697 --> 13:20.532
You want to catch the k'hund,
go try it yourself!

13:20.534 --> 13:23.134
You're just as strong as me,
if you wanted to be.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.736
You know how
dangerous that is for him.

13:24.738 --> 13:27.572
And it's not dangerous
for me too?

13:27.574 --> 13:29.374
Every Kryptonian
on this planet

13:29.376 --> 13:31.109
wants to kill me
expect my cousin.

13:31.111 --> 13:32.377
I have to live with that.

13:32.379 --> 13:33.578
And he could, too!

13:35.482 --> 13:37.749
What are you so afraid of?

13:37.751 --> 13:39.184
You talk about
honoring your people,

13:39.186 --> 13:42.020
and yet you refuse
to be one of them.

13:45.625 --> 13:46.791
I got to go.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.326
I have work in the morning.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.995
Another job that
underappreciates me.

14:14.588 --> 14:15.920
What? How...

14:15.922 --> 14:17.889
That's cat's elevator.

14:17.891 --> 14:20.592
It is absolutely ridiculous
for her to have her own
personal elevator,

14:20.594 --> 14:22.961
-plus horrible for
the environment.
-Cat: Ker-rah!

14:22.963 --> 14:26.531
You are literally impervious
to bullets and I'm worried
for your safety right now.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.333
Okay?

14:28.335 --> 14:30.435
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

14:30.437 --> 14:31.603
Your latte, Ms. Grant.

14:31.605 --> 14:33.204
Oh.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.839
Walking from the main elevator
takes an extra 90 seconds,

14:34.841 --> 14:37.075
which means your latte's
90 seconds colder.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.311
Brazen.

14:40.313 --> 14:43.481
That's a new color on you.
I don't mind it.

14:43.483 --> 14:46.885
Yet. What do you want?

14:46.887 --> 14:49.487
I've got a scoop for you.
Can we talk?

14:49.489 --> 14:51.089
In private?

14:51.858 --> 14:53.258
<i> Allez.</i>

14:55.195 --> 14:56.361
Cat: What am I looking at?

14:56.363 --> 14:59.364
It's Supergirl
letting the bad guy go.

15:01.801 --> 15:05.036
Put this under your hat
until we figure out
what's going on.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.771
What's going on is

15:06.773 --> 15:09.974
that Supergirl isn't the hero
she claims to be.

15:09.976 --> 15:11.409
Cat: There must be
an explanation.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.045
-Maybe it's another bizarro.
-Who cares?

15:14.047 --> 15:17.548
Supergirl turning bad,
and we're the first
to report it.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.450
We could change
the conversation,
we could dominate

15:19.452 --> 15:21.119
the headlines,
we could...

15:21.121 --> 15:23.588
Don't use media jargon
that you don't understand.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.089
-But...
-That'll be all.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.170
I see you had better luck
than Supergirl.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.438
I've dealt with worse.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.007
Do not inflate
your own worth, human.

15:43.009 --> 15:45.476
Supergirl didn't even
try to apprehend me.

15:45.478 --> 15:46.978
What are you
talking about?

15:46.980 --> 15:47.946
She said you fought
and you got away.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.447
She's a liar.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.482
She said she didn't want
to waste her time with me.

15:51.484 --> 15:52.951
Get him out of my face!

15:54.321 --> 15:55.520
(Grunting)

15:57.691 --> 15:59.958
Do you believe him?

15:59.960 --> 16:01.526
I'm almost done
with this e-mail.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.394
This is the scoop
of your life.

16:08.702 --> 16:10.468
Hi, Siobhan!

16:10.470 --> 16:11.736
What do you want?

16:11.738 --> 16:13.571
Stalker.

16:13.573 --> 16:16.641
Messenger downstairs
wants you to sign for
Ms. Grant's flowers.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.576
Okay, you do it.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.912
Well, I would, but Ms. Grant
needs me to proof a column
for her asap.

16:20.914 --> 16:22.747
(Sighing)

16:22.749 --> 16:25.283
I'm sure one day she'll
give you more editorial
responsibilities too.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.285
Fine.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.579
Cat: I know you see yourself
as a plucky heroine

16:54.581 --> 16:58.950
who broke a story as big
as Watergate and then gave it
to my biggest competitor,

16:58.952 --> 17:02.086
and I know you think that
once the <i> daily planet</i>
runs the story

17:02.088 --> 17:03.621
that you will have
a fancy job there,

17:03.623 --> 17:05.456
and I know that you believe
in the end

17:05.458 --> 17:08.159
that I will admire your
gumption for scooping me

17:08.161 --> 17:10.361
and I will beg you
to come back.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.630
-Will you?
-No.

17:12.632 --> 17:16.501
I admire loyalty,
integrity and employees
that I can trust.

17:16.503 --> 17:20.671
Not backstabbing,
opportunistic little...

17:20.673 --> 17:22.140
Imps.

17:23.109 --> 17:25.443
Clean out your desk.

17:25.445 --> 17:29.213
I'm sorry, was I using
my inside voice?

17:29.849 --> 17:33.484
You are fired!

17:33.486 --> 17:36.020
Now, before you go
skipping all the way
back to Metropolis,

17:36.022 --> 17:37.588
I will save you
the bus fare.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.792
I had a much too long
conversation with Perry white.

17:40.794 --> 17:43.828
And there is no job
waiting for you there.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.696
Mmm.

17:45.698 --> 17:48.499
Now, be gone.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.346
Hey, are you okay?

18:04.517 --> 18:06.784
Well, I guess
that's your exit.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.159
(Clicking tongue)

18:15.161 --> 18:19.030
Well, that was awkward.

18:19.032 --> 18:20.531
But not surprising, though.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.267
She was a bad seed,
it was only a matter of time.

18:23.269 --> 18:26.137
I know what will lighten
the mood, drinks...

18:27.707 --> 18:28.840
And dancing.

18:29.509 --> 18:30.775
Who's in?

18:30.777 --> 18:32.610
(Club music playing)

18:35.081 --> 18:37.148
Today's music is so loud!

18:37.150 --> 18:38.716
-Right?
-(Laughing)

18:38.718 --> 18:41.185
Siobhan still has not
texted me back.

18:41.821 --> 18:42.954
I hope she's okay.

18:42.956 --> 18:44.856
She's fine.
Just give her some time.

18:44.858 --> 18:47.358
Speaking of which,
Kara said she was
going to be here soon.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.327
Do you think
she's still on her way?

18:49.329 --> 18:51.996
Oh, yeah. Oh, look.
There she is.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.798
I see her. I think...

18:53.800 --> 18:55.266
I think that's her.

18:58.538 --> 19:01.072
Hey! Wow.

19:01.074 --> 19:02.540
Hey, cat, look at you.

19:02.542 --> 19:03.608
Wow!

19:03.610 --> 19:05.776
Yeah, that's what
i was going for.

19:05.778 --> 19:06.944
(Chuckling)

19:06.946 --> 19:08.746
You want to dance?

19:08.748 --> 19:10.448
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Oh!

19:10.450 --> 19:12.817
Kara, whoa, whoa,
whoa, hey, hey!

19:12.819 --> 19:14.652
I just, I just...

19:16.656 --> 19:18.556
I love this song.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.358
It's a good song.
(Chuckling)

19:21.928 --> 19:23.294
You okay?

19:23.897 --> 19:25.796
I've never been better.

19:25.798 --> 19:28.099
Maybe we should, um...
Let's go have a drink
with winn real quick.

19:28.101 --> 19:30.201
No, no.
Why would I get a drink

19:30.203 --> 19:31.903
when I'm finally getting
what I want?

19:34.040 --> 19:35.840
What I want...

19:35.842 --> 19:39.710
Is what the poor man's
Lois Lane
was too idiotic to keep.

19:39.712 --> 19:40.645
What are you doing?

19:40.647 --> 19:42.079
Yo, it's not you,
come on!

19:42.081 --> 19:43.881
-(Giggling)
-Come on, man!

19:43.883 --> 19:46.217
-Don't walk away from me.
-(Grunting)

19:46.219 --> 19:48.219
You need to get her
out of your head, James.

19:48.221 --> 19:51.389
Lucy was a clingy,
insecure daddy's girl,

19:51.391 --> 19:53.524
who was afraid and
jealous of your...

19:53.526 --> 19:55.626
-Kara, stop.
-I'm done pretending.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.261
What are you doing?
Stop it.

19:57.263 --> 19:58.663
(Giggling)

20:02.335 --> 20:04.302
-(Cell phone chiming)
-It's my phone.

20:05.905 --> 20:08.506
James: It's cat.

20:08.508 --> 20:12.677
Oh, why don't you just
tell her to get back in her
litter box and leave us alone?

20:13.279 --> 20:15.746
(Scoffing)

20:15.748 --> 20:17.848
-Ms. Grant.
<i> -I need to talk to Supergirl.</i>

20:17.850 --> 20:22.486
Press your silly watch
or whatever it is
and send her here now.

20:24.857 --> 20:27.091
Ms. Grant wants to see...

20:27.093 --> 20:28.693
Supergirl.
Where did she go?

20:28.695 --> 20:30.294
What happened?

20:30.296 --> 20:31.696
Something's wrong with Kara.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.369
Mmm.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.238
What do you want?

20:40.240 --> 20:42.273
Well, I would like to know
if Ashton kutcher
and his camera crew

20:42.275 --> 20:44.375
are hiding
underneath your cape.

20:44.377 --> 20:48.846
Supergirl would never release
an evil alien caught
in the act of armed robbery.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.315
So, I assume
I'm being <i> punk'd.</i>

20:51.317 --> 20:54.685
I wouldn't assume anything
from now on, cat.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.420
Did you just
call me cat?

20:56.422 --> 20:58.623
You branded me in the media
as a girl scout.

20:59.659 --> 21:02.893
"Supergirl is brave,
kind and strong."

21:02.895 --> 21:06.397
-Mmm-hmm?
-Isn't that kind of
a stock characterization?

21:06.399 --> 21:07.932
Very two-dimensional.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.967
Everyone knows real people
have a dark side.

21:09.969 --> 21:13.137
Yes, but you don't get
to be a real person.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.639
You're a superhero.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.440
You get to represent
all the goodness in the world.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.509
Yeah, well, I'm sick of it.

21:18.511 --> 21:21.345
And you know
what else I'm sick of?

21:21.347 --> 21:26.417
Enabling all of you
in your victimhood.

21:26.419 --> 21:28.853
"Oh, well, my building's
burning down, la-di-dah.

21:28.855 --> 21:32.857
"Supergirl will just swoop
in and save the day."

21:32.859 --> 21:36.627
Well, get used to
the flames, people,
'cause I quit.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.563
Supergirl...

21:41.034 --> 21:45.369
I fear that you're having
some sort of mental breakdown.

21:45.371 --> 21:47.204
Don't worry, it happens
to the best of us,

21:47.206 --> 21:50.775
and I'm happy to take
you to Dr. shuman
for emergency Lexapro,

21:50.777 --> 21:54.712
that is, if your alien
brain will respond
to the ssris.

21:54.714 --> 21:57.915
But in the meantime,
i would lay low.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.384
This haughty attitude
is highly unsuitable.

22:00.386 --> 22:02.486
Well, I learned it
from the best.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.121
Cat Grant.

22:04.123 --> 22:05.456
(Chuckling)

22:05.458 --> 22:08.092
You're the most arrogant,
self-serving,

22:08.094 --> 22:10.127
mean-spirited person I know.

22:10.129 --> 22:12.129
Now, you listen to me.

22:12.131 --> 22:14.332
I made you.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.267
And you are not going
to let me down.

22:16.269 --> 22:17.501
Or what?

22:17.503 --> 22:19.103
-Or what?
-Wait, I forgot.

22:19.105 --> 22:22.606
You're the most powerful
person in national city.

22:22.608 --> 22:24.975
At least that's what
they say on TV.

22:27.080 --> 22:30.314
You want to see
what powerful
really looks like?

22:30.316 --> 22:31.849
Watch.

22:31.851 --> 22:32.917
(Grunting)

22:32.919 --> 22:34.452
(Screaming)

22:42.495 --> 22:43.961
(Groaning)

22:45.131 --> 22:47.164
True power, cat,

22:47.166 --> 22:50.101
is deciding who
will live and who will die.

22:51.571 --> 22:54.972
And don't ever
call me again.

23:06.786 --> 23:09.854
Director henshaw,
need to talk to you please.

23:09.856 --> 23:12.089
Hey, something bad
has happened to Kara.

23:12.091 --> 23:14.125
We know.
She was acting strange.

23:14.127 --> 23:16.327
Distracted. We thought
it was personal at first,

23:16.329 --> 23:19.730
but then she let an
alien fugitive escape.

23:19.732 --> 23:22.967
Pull up the missions
Supergirl has run in
the last 48 hours.

23:29.142 --> 23:32.109
-Alex: The fire.
-Run a thermodynamic scan.

23:34.881 --> 23:37.314
Look at the
radiation signature.

23:37.316 --> 23:38.649
That's kryptonite.

23:38.651 --> 23:39.717
Not exactly.

23:39.719 --> 23:42.253
It's synthetic.
It's manmade.

23:42.255 --> 23:43.888
Well, it's close to
the real thing,

23:43.890 --> 23:45.689
but whoever made it,
didn't get it quite right.

23:45.691 --> 23:48.492
-Meaning what?
-It's not damaging her
on a cellular level.

23:48.494 --> 23:50.194
But it could explain
the erratic behavior.

23:50.196 --> 23:51.662
Who the hell
would make kryptonite?

23:51.664 --> 23:54.165
Yeah, that's my bad.

23:56.702 --> 23:59.637
Come on.
This isn't necessary.
I came here to help.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.405
I didn't even know
kryptonite was a thing.

24:01.407 --> 24:02.640
Until we showed you.

24:02.642 --> 24:04.442
And we took down bizarro.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.777
I went through all that
trouble to create her,

24:06.779 --> 24:08.846
when all this time,
right in front of me,

24:08.848 --> 24:13.484
was a substance
whose sole molecular purpose
was to kill Kryptonians.

24:13.486 --> 24:14.752
Sort of ironic.

24:14.754 --> 24:17.254
-You're outta your mind.
-I'm only practical.

24:17.256 --> 24:19.423
Non and his army
will return. Soon.

24:19.425 --> 24:21.158
So, I took matters
into my own hands.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.127
You've recreated kryptonite.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.028
Tried to.

24:24.030 --> 24:26.197
I just didn't get it right.

24:26.199 --> 24:29.433
The satellite on that
rooftop was yours.

24:31.270 --> 24:32.269
You set a trap for non.

24:32.271 --> 24:34.305
The fire,
that was an accident.

24:34.307 --> 24:36.640
I never meant
to endanger any
firefighters, any civilians.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.108
Not even Supergirl.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.244
So, you figured if you
booby-trapped a satellite,

24:40.246 --> 24:43.681
then your kryptonite
would kill non just in case
you went to go check on it?

24:43.683 --> 24:45.416
It didn't work
exactly as planned.

24:45.418 --> 24:46.650
It never does with you!

24:46.652 --> 24:48.586
I didn't know
Supergirl would show up

24:48.588 --> 24:51.388
or that be she's affected
by the synthetic k
in such a surprising...

24:51.390 --> 24:54.258
You're right.
You just thought
it would kill her.

24:54.260 --> 24:56.727
When I realized Supergirl
had been exposed,

24:56.729 --> 25:00.364
I started tracking her
to see what the red kryptonite
would do to her.

25:00.366 --> 25:02.466
I saw her let
the alien escape.

25:02.468 --> 25:04.201
I didn't know what to think.

25:04.203 --> 25:06.370
And then tonight,
she threw cat Grant
off her building.

25:06.372 --> 25:07.605
She killed Ms. Grant?

25:07.607 --> 25:09.373
No.
Cat has nine lives.

25:09.375 --> 25:10.441
She's fine.

25:10.443 --> 25:11.976
But Supergirl isn't.

25:12.512 --> 25:14.912
I'm sorry, Alex.

25:14.914 --> 25:17.548
I came in to make this right.

25:17.550 --> 25:18.849
I created
red kryptonite.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.518
Maybe I can create
an antidote.

25:22.522 --> 25:24.021
(Sighing)

25:26.526 --> 25:29.693
You better hope so,
for national city's sake.

25:29.695 --> 25:32.630
Because you just turned
Supergirl into the monster

25:32.632 --> 25:34.164
you always feared
she'd be.

25:38.905 --> 25:41.272
Ms. Grant, what's going on?

25:42.542 --> 25:44.308
(Sighing)

25:44.310 --> 25:46.544
Supergirl has completely
gone off the rails.

25:46.546 --> 25:48.913
And I have to publicly
denounce her as a villain.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.581
Ms. Grant,
Supergirl's not a...

25:50.583 --> 25:53.417
-Not a villain.
-That doesn't
change anything.

25:53.419 --> 25:57.254
People are in danger
and the public needs
to be warned.

25:57.256 --> 25:58.489
Ms. Grant, look.

25:58.491 --> 26:00.991
I am sure that Supergirl
is gonna be fine soon.

26:00.993 --> 26:03.427
But if you denounce her,
it's not gonna matter.

26:03.429 --> 26:04.762
She'll have lost
the city's trust.

26:04.764 --> 26:06.497
She threw me off
of a balcony.

26:06.499 --> 26:08.232
I fell 40 stories.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.968
I was a few feet away
from splattering
onto the pavement

26:10.970 --> 26:12.770
when she flew down
and caught me on a whim.

26:12.772 --> 26:15.839
Now, I appreciate that you
are trying to cure her,

26:15.841 --> 26:20.377
but at this moment,
can you guarantee me that
the public is safe?

26:20.379 --> 26:24.982
Can you guarantee that
any of us are safe?

26:27.219 --> 26:28.419
No.

26:31.591 --> 26:34.191
Citizens of national city,
this is cat Grant,

26:34.193 --> 26:36.327
live from catco Plaza.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.897
As you all know,
i have been

26:39.899 --> 26:42.533
Supergirl's most
outspoken champion.

26:44.337 --> 26:46.670
So, you can imagine
how difficult it is for me

26:46.672 --> 26:48.839
to tell you that i
and catco

26:48.841 --> 26:51.241
can no longer stand
behind Supergirl.

26:52.979 --> 26:54.244
I made you trust her.

26:54.246 --> 26:57.314
I gave you my word
that she was safe,

26:57.316 --> 26:58.482
<i> a friend.</i>

26:59.852 --> 27:01.285
<i> I was wrong.</i>

27:02.822 --> 27:04.421
<i> Supergirl has changed.</i>

27:04.423 --> 27:07.891
She is unstable
and extremely dangerous.

27:09.629 --> 27:14.865
She threw me off of
a building last night
and threatened my life and...

27:14.867 --> 27:17.434
Who knows what else
she is capable of?

27:17.436 --> 27:22.139
<i> It's not easy being</i>
<i> let down by our idols.</i>

27:22.141 --> 27:25.609
<i> Having someone who</i>
<i> embodies our heroic ideals</i>

27:25.611 --> 27:28.846
<i> helps us believe</i>
<i> that we can be heroes, too.</i>

27:28.848 --> 27:31.081
Sometimes heroes fall.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.916
So, please,

27:32.918 --> 27:34.451
for your own safety,

27:35.721 --> 27:37.521
stay away from Supergirl.

27:40.159 --> 27:42.860
Okay, that's enough.
Turn it off.

27:42.862 --> 27:45.062
Play it on a loop.
Everyone needs to know.

27:46.132 --> 27:47.598
(Clearing throat)

28:01.380 --> 28:02.613
Kara?

28:14.026 --> 28:16.226
Hello, sister.

28:16.228 --> 28:20.664
Look, I picked out
my own outfit without any
fashion advice from you.

28:20.666 --> 28:26.303
All these years you've
pushed those dowdy sweaters
and skirts on me!

28:26.305 --> 28:29.707
Trying to cloak my beauty
so I don't outshine yours.

28:32.678 --> 28:34.178
Kara!

28:34.180 --> 28:36.413
(Laughing manically)

28:36.415 --> 28:38.649
I needed
a wardrobe overhaul.

28:41.587 --> 28:42.953
(Laughing manically)

28:42.955 --> 28:45.255
Kara, this isn't you.

28:45.257 --> 28:47.491
I'm more me than
I've ever been.

28:47.493 --> 28:48.959
Please, listen.

28:48.961 --> 28:50.627
You were exposed
to red kryptonite.

28:50.629 --> 28:52.062
It's altered your brain.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.664
You're not seeing clearly.

28:53.666 --> 28:54.998
Oh, I see clearly!

28:55.000 --> 28:58.102
I see how you've always
been jealous of me!

28:58.104 --> 28:59.603
You didn't want me
to come out as Supergirl

28:59.605 --> 29:02.206
because you didn't want me
to own my powers.

29:03.576 --> 29:06.343
I can fly.

29:06.345 --> 29:10.347
I can catch bullets
with my bare hands.

29:11.450 --> 29:15.285
And that makes
you feel worthless.

29:16.355 --> 29:17.688
No.

29:17.690 --> 29:18.989
No, I'm proud of you.

29:18.991 --> 29:21.258
And when you couldn't
stop me being Supergirl,

29:21.260 --> 29:23.927
you got me
to work for you.

29:23.929 --> 29:26.096
To retain some control.

29:27.666 --> 29:29.199
(Scoffing)

29:29.201 --> 29:31.168
Those days are so over.

29:31.971 --> 29:34.671
I am finally free of you,

29:35.374 --> 29:37.641
and I'm ready to soar.

29:40.813 --> 29:42.346
Look at that city.

29:43.849 --> 29:45.649
They worship me.

29:46.719 --> 29:49.520
And those who don't, will.

29:50.689 --> 29:51.922
Alex: Kara,

29:51.924 --> 29:53.423
just listen to yourself.

29:53.425 --> 29:56.059
Go, cut the big sister
act, Alex.

29:56.061 --> 29:57.928
We have never been sisters.

29:57.930 --> 30:00.197
We don't share blood.

30:00.199 --> 30:01.799
And you know
what the sad truth is?

30:03.402 --> 30:07.838
Without me, you have no life.

30:09.275 --> 30:11.575
And that kills you.

30:14.013 --> 30:17.247
Deep down, you hate me.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.651
And that's
why you killed my aunt.

30:23.722 --> 30:25.756
Aww, did I make you cry?

30:25.758 --> 30:27.224
(Sniffling)

30:28.661 --> 30:30.661
You know what they say,

30:30.663 --> 30:32.329
the truth hurts.

30:34.133 --> 30:35.599
(Crying)

30:40.906 --> 30:42.539
(Indistinct chattering)

30:48.214 --> 30:50.547
-Is it ready, yet?
-Almost.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.584
Alex.

30:54.854 --> 30:56.320
How is Kara?

30:57.122 --> 30:59.389
She's gone, Hank...

30:59.391 --> 31:02.826
I don't even know who she is
anymore. I don't know
what she's capable of.

31:02.828 --> 31:04.595
Senator crane:
You need to take her down.

31:05.564 --> 31:07.798
I know this is personal
for both of you.

31:07.800 --> 31:13.070
But you need to use everything
the deo has and protect
this city from Supergirl.

31:13.072 --> 31:14.404
I'm not going to kill her.

31:14.406 --> 31:16.607
Yes, Supergirl saved my life.

31:16.609 --> 31:19.209
That's the last thing I want.

31:19.211 --> 31:23.480
But the deo's job is to
protect this world
from alien threats.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.817
What do you call
Supergirl right now?

31:30.489 --> 31:33.223
Vasquez, assemble the troops.
We're moving out.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.825
Supergirl's the target.

31:39.365 --> 31:41.965
If anything can reverse
the red kryptonite effect
on your sister,

31:41.967 --> 31:43.667
this should do it.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.102
It better.

31:45.104 --> 31:47.604
Good luck. I mean that.

31:51.010 --> 31:56.313
<i> As you all know,</i>
<i> I have been Supergirl's most</i>
<i> outspoken champion.</i>

31:56.315 --> 31:59.917
<i> So, you can imagine</i>
<i> how difficult it is for me</i>
<i> to tell you</i>

31:59.919 --> 32:03.787
<i> that I and catco can</i>
<i> no longer stand</i>
<i> behind Supergirl.</i>

32:03.789 --> 32:05.489
-(Indistinct chattering)
-(Gasps)

32:05.491 --> 32:07.524
<i> I made you trust her.</i>

32:07.526 --> 32:11.361
<i> I gave you my word</i>
<i> that she was safe...</i>

32:11.363 --> 32:12.596
(Glass shattering)

32:12.598 --> 32:14.097
<i> That she was a friend.</i>

32:16.168 --> 32:17.501
<i> I was wrong.</i>

32:17.503 --> 32:18.902
<i> Supergirl has changed.</i>

32:18.904 --> 32:21.905
<i> She is unstable</i>
<i> and extremely dangerous.</i>

32:22.675 --> 32:24.975
<i> Sometimes, heroes fall.</i>

32:24.977 --> 32:26.777
(Police siren blaring)

32:26.779 --> 32:30.013
<i> So, please,</i>
<i> for your own safety...</i>

32:31.283 --> 32:32.816
<i> -Stay away...</i>
-(Crashing)

32:42.294 --> 32:43.927
(Tires screeching)

32:54.840 --> 32:56.373
(Powering up)

32:59.044 --> 33:00.610
(Groaning)

33:02.247 --> 33:03.747
(Tires screeching)

33:06.085 --> 33:08.085
Supergirl: Classic Alex.

33:08.087 --> 33:10.253
Always in time
to ruin the fun.

33:10.255 --> 33:11.388
Supergirl.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.056
I want to help you.

33:13.058 --> 33:15.125
-Hank henshaw: Supergirl! No!
-Doesn't look like help to me.

33:18.597 --> 33:20.130
(Alex panting)

33:20.132 --> 33:21.465
Alex: Please!

33:21.467 --> 33:23.600
You have to stop.

33:23.602 --> 33:26.603
Nothing on earth can stop me.

33:26.605 --> 33:28.171
(Shakily) You
don't want to kill me.

33:28.874 --> 33:30.340
(Powering up)

33:30.342 --> 33:31.775
(Breathing heavily)

33:34.179 --> 33:35.746
(Growling)

33:44.723 --> 33:46.189
(Supergirl groaning)

33:46.892 --> 33:48.492
(Grunting)

33:48.494 --> 33:49.860
Don't do this.

33:57.469 --> 33:59.202
-(Crashing)
-(Glass shattering)

34:02.307 --> 34:03.707
(Grunting)

34:11.850 --> 34:13.183
(Groaning)

34:25.497 --> 34:27.064
(Powering up)

34:30.402 --> 34:31.935
(Panting)

34:52.724 --> 34:54.257
(People clamoring)

34:59.098 --> 35:01.565
Go. Please.

35:16.048 --> 35:17.747
(Panting)

35:35.267 --> 35:36.433
Did I kill anyone?

35:36.435 --> 35:38.869
No. No,
you didn't kill anyone.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.073
(Voice breaking) Your arm...

35:43.075 --> 35:45.842
Broken bones heal
and this will too.

35:47.012 --> 35:48.211
(Sniffling)

35:50.816 --> 35:52.015
(Crying)

35:57.122 --> 36:02.492
It was so horrible, Alex.
It was so bad.
It was so horrible.

36:02.494 --> 36:05.695
Every bad thought
I've ever had,

36:05.697 --> 36:07.931
it just came to the surface.

36:07.933 --> 36:09.633
(Sobbing)

36:11.436 --> 36:13.069
I couldn't stop it.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.277
I didn't mean it...

36:22.214 --> 36:24.114
I didn't mean
what I said to you.

36:24.116 --> 36:27.984
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
for what I said.

36:29.288 --> 36:34.157
Kara, you're my sister
and I love you.

36:34.993 --> 36:36.259
No matter what.

36:37.196 --> 36:38.662
Yeah.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.333
There's some truth to
what you said.

36:48.073 --> 36:49.906
We're going to
have to work on that.

36:56.148 --> 36:57.614
What about j'onn?

36:57.616 --> 36:59.115
What do I call you?

37:01.553 --> 37:03.486
My name is j'onn j'onzz.

37:03.488 --> 37:05.222
Is Hank henshaw dead?

37:06.892 --> 37:07.791
Yes.

37:07.793 --> 37:09.192
Did you kill him?

37:15.701 --> 37:17.167
(Sighing)

37:21.106 --> 37:23.240
I've always been
afraid of aliens.

37:25.477 --> 37:26.910
My whole life.

37:29.414 --> 37:31.214
And then you changed my mind.

37:33.552 --> 37:36.653
But now I realize you and
everything you said is a lie.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.124
(Door opening)

37:57.342 --> 37:58.775
Why didn't you run?

38:01.346 --> 38:02.879
You could've gotten away.

38:04.349 --> 38:07.350
Because I'd spend a thousand
years in this cell if it meant

38:07.352 --> 38:10.020
keeping you
and your sister

38:11.189 --> 38:12.689
safe.

38:49.261 --> 38:50.794
(Sighing)

39:02.808 --> 39:04.140
James: Hey.

39:04.142 --> 39:05.342
You okay?

39:07.446 --> 39:08.812
No. (Chuckling)

39:11.983 --> 39:14.250
About the other night...

39:14.252 --> 39:16.519
Listen, I know
it wasn't your fault.

39:16.521 --> 39:17.954
So...

39:17.956 --> 39:20.957
Why do I get the feeling
that we're not okay?

39:20.959 --> 39:22.359
Because we're not.

39:23.261 --> 39:24.494
(Exhaling)

39:26.998 --> 39:29.966
I did not mean those things
i said about Lucy.

39:29.968 --> 39:33.837
Yeah, but there had to be some
truth to it, Kara.

39:33.839 --> 39:37.440
Okay, I mean, just to know
that you have that sort of
anger inside of you...

39:37.442 --> 39:38.742
No, I don't hate Lucy.

39:38.744 --> 39:40.377
I promise. I...

39:41.880 --> 39:43.313
(Sighing)

39:45.584 --> 39:47.384
Was jealous of her.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.120
I've always been
jealous of her.

39:53.859 --> 39:55.792
I would be jealous of
anyone you loved.

39:55.794 --> 39:57.227
(Exhaling)

39:59.197 --> 40:00.864
James, I...

40:00.866 --> 40:03.533
Don't finish that sentence.

40:06.438 --> 40:07.904
I need a little time.

40:10.409 --> 40:11.808
To think.

40:15.347 --> 40:16.546
Okay.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.905
I love this city. (Exhaling)

40:43.375 --> 40:45.308
The lights.

40:45.310 --> 40:46.576
All the windows.

40:48.447 --> 40:52.582
I love that behind
every window there's a story.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.487
Someone's eating take-out
with their boyfriend.

40:57.489 --> 41:01.357
Someone's playing board games
with their kids.

41:05.397 --> 41:06.930
(Exhaling)

41:06.932 --> 41:10.166
To me, every person
in the city is a light.

41:10.168 --> 41:12.335
And every time I've helped
one of them...

41:13.738 --> 41:16.773
A little bit of their light
has become a part of me.

41:16.775 --> 41:20.376
I've never been happier than
when I've been Supergirl...

41:20.378 --> 41:24.481
I know what happened
wasn't exactly my fault, my...

41:26.551 --> 41:28.117
My brain was altered.

41:34.226 --> 41:39.128
But it brought something
inside of me out.

41:39.130 --> 41:44.334
That was mean and horrible...

41:47.806 --> 41:51.374
-What I did to you, Ms. Grant.
-Cat: Oh, please.

41:51.376 --> 41:53.409
I've base jumped
mount Kilimanjaro.

41:53.411 --> 41:56.312
Do you really think
you scared me?

41:56.314 --> 41:59.983
Well, okay, yes,
you did scare me.

42:02.354 --> 42:03.553
I know...

42:05.257 --> 42:08.558
I scared the whole city...

42:08.560 --> 42:13.663
And now I'm so afraid
that I'm never gonna
win them back.

42:13.665 --> 42:16.499
Well... (Sighing) If you came
here for me to tell you that

42:16.501 --> 42:18.268
everything is
going to be okay,

42:18.270 --> 42:20.270
I can't do that.
It's not that easy.

42:21.072 --> 42:22.438
(Sighing) I know.

42:22.440 --> 42:24.207
Now, I said that
it's not going to be easy.

42:24.209 --> 42:27.377
But I didn't say
it would be impossible.

42:27.379 --> 42:29.412
Personally, I don't
believe in failure.

42:29.414 --> 42:31.948
Not if you get back up
and face the music.

42:32.484 --> 42:34.017
It takes time.

42:35.086 --> 42:37.720
But if anybody
can win this city back...

42:39.024 --> 42:40.456
It's you.

42:43.562 --> 42:46.396
Can I just sit here
for a little while?

42:46.398 --> 42:47.564
Of course.

43:07.986 --> 43:10.219
(Theme music playing)
