WEBVTT

00:02.086 --> 00:03.169
Just going to drop her on the couch.

00:03.253 --> 00:07.048
Okay. l'll pick her up tomorrow.

00:07.257 --> 00:09.217
You're not driving home until you
have another cup of coffee.

00:09.301 --> 00:12.804
Hey, don't worry about whispering.
She slept through everything.

00:12.971 --> 00:16.516
Jet engines, turbulence,
bipolar flight attendants.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.143
l hate her so much. l hate you!

00:20.646 --> 00:22.689
No, l don't. l love you.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.192
l resent her youth.

00:27.486 --> 00:29.153
Coffee may not be the answer.

00:29.988 --> 00:32.073
How long has it been since you've slept?

00:32.491 --> 00:35.118
Let's see.
l didn't get any sleep at your parents',

00:35.744 --> 00:37.328
both our flights were delayed,

00:37.746 --> 00:40.289
somebody phoned in a bomb threat to the
Taco Bell Express,

00:40.374 --> 00:42.750
they shut down the airport so...

00:42.835 --> 00:44.877
Four hundred eighty-seven hours?

00:47.089 --> 00:49.006
You need to lie down. Come on.

00:49.091 --> 00:50.425
Okay.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.636
Go away, balls.

00:54.096 --> 00:55.221
No, no, no.

00:55.305 --> 00:58.516
We don't sleep on pool tables anymore.
We're parents now.

00:58.600 --> 00:59.892
Nothing fun or weird.

01:00.144 --> 01:01.310
Your mother's a bitch.

01:03.772 --> 01:06.190
Where'd that come from?
l thought you liked her.

01:06.275 --> 01:10.111
Never did.
Your dad, on the other hand, he's a flirt.

01:10.195 --> 01:12.113
Has he ever flirted with you?

01:13.782 --> 01:16.951
No, he only flirts with people he likes.
Come on.

01:19.621 --> 01:23.124
Oh, my God. This is heaven.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.544
What are you doing in heaven?

01:26.670 --> 01:30.423
Part of an exchange program. Gandhi's
down there at a strip club with Mussolini.

01:32.176 --> 01:33.342
Just sleep.

01:33.802 --> 01:34.802
Okay.

01:36.054 --> 01:39.390
Hey, remember that time when l tried
to trick you into getting me pregnant

01:39.475 --> 01:40.558
to save our marriage?

01:40.642 --> 01:41.642
What? No!

01:43.812 --> 01:48.691
Yeah. Sam was eight and l stopped taking
the pill and started sleeping naked.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.359
You don't remember?

01:50.444 --> 01:53.571
l remember the naked thing.
l didn't think you wanted a baby.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.323
l thought you wanted a new car.

01:58.202 --> 02:03.164
But it's all right. We have the greatest kid
ever and you're a good dad.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.041
Good night.

02:05.167 --> 02:07.001
Wait, wait. Before you fall asleep,

02:07.711 --> 02:11.130
the time we went to Vegas and you told me
that you got robbed. Did that really happen?

02:11.340 --> 02:14.634
No, l lost it all on blackjack. Remember?

02:15.636 --> 02:17.136
This is like a truth serum.

02:18.806 --> 02:21.766
ls it hard for you to find another guy
because l set the bar too high?

02:21.850 --> 02:22.850
No.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.061
What do you know? You're half asleep.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.690
Nolan?

02:30.442 --> 02:31.442
Nolan!

02:31.527 --> 02:32.485
What?

02:32.569 --> 02:34.695
What do you think about the fact that Ed
just called you a pussy?

02:35.781 --> 02:36.823
l didn't hear that.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.658
-Ed?
-Pussy.

02:40.577 --> 02:41.786
He's probably right.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.585
Now, hold on. Before everybody leaves,

02:49.670 --> 02:53.256
l want to invite you all to take part
in something that l am very excited about.

02:53.340 --> 02:56.843
l knew this day was coming.
lt's either real estate or vitamins.

02:58.637 --> 03:03.099
No, Ed. A few nights ago,
l had an experience that led me to believe

03:03.183 --> 03:06.269
that we could advance the frontiers
of psychological study.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.729
l'm talking about stripping away
your defenses to a point

03:08.814 --> 03:10.982
where inhibitions come down
and truths come out.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.609
So, what? We're all going to get drunk?

03:15.070 --> 03:17.822
No. l'm talking about
sleep deprivation therapy.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.574
Can l be drunk for that?

03:22.119 --> 03:24.412
No. Because sometimes
when people get drunk,

03:24.496 --> 03:26.747
they grab a gun and shoot their boyfriends
in the testicles.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.667
You're talking about me, aren't you?

03:29.751 --> 03:31.043
l thought that was abundantly clear.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.881
Now, l've done a lot of research on this.

03:34.965 --> 03:37.925
l think if we stay up long enough,
we can get to a whole new level of honesty.

03:38.051 --> 03:41.304
That's the way my old associate
in Nam used to do it.

03:41.430 --> 03:44.515
You ought to bring Pho Than Kwon in here.

03:44.600 --> 03:48.728
That old boy kept me awake
70 hours straight at the Hanoi Hilton,

03:49.021 --> 03:50.855
getting intel out of me.

03:50.939 --> 03:55.276
Seriously, you can get him. He's got
a noodle shop down at the Music Center.

03:56.361 --> 03:59.697
He gives me 1 0% off because he tortured me.

03:59.823 --> 04:01.407
A real sweetheart.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.786
lt's your mistake for staying at a Hilton.

04:08.332 --> 04:11.042
l want you all here on Friday
for a weekend workshop.

04:11.335 --> 04:13.920
Some of us might have plans this weekend.

04:14.046 --> 04:15.880
And what were you planning to do?

04:16.590 --> 04:20.468
Call my friends and ask them why they never
invite me anywhere on the weekends.

04:20.886 --> 04:23.763
l guess l could reschedule it
for next weekend.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.974
How are we going to stay up that long?

04:27.184 --> 04:31.562
The way Pho Than kept us awake, he'd take
a car battery and some jumper cables

04:31.647 --> 04:33.356
and clamp them onto our nipples.

04:34.232 --> 04:35.399
l think we'll start with coffee.

04:35.817 --> 04:39.570
Pho Than used coffee, too. He'd boil up
a big pot and then make us bend over...

04:39.655 --> 04:40.863
We're just going to drink it.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.156
We drank it.

04:49.164 --> 04:52.917
Anyway, so they make me empty my pockets
with all my good-luck charms

04:53.001 --> 04:54.835
in front of everybody, including Jake Slater.

04:55.504 --> 04:59.632
lt's midterms. l had all my good luck stuff.
My silver dollar, my dreamcatcher,

04:59.716 --> 05:00.716
my Monopoly dog...

05:00.842 --> 05:03.678
Hey, at least you didn't have the pouch full
of your baby teeth. Right?

05:03.929 --> 05:05.680
Crap. You had the baby teeth.

05:06.682 --> 05:09.183
Well, l had to. l had an algebra test.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.310
l'm a freak.

05:11.395 --> 05:15.439
No, you're not. l know tons of people
who carry good-luck charms. Here.

05:17.484 --> 05:20.528
My dad made this penny for me
when we went to Carlsbad Caverns.

05:20.904 --> 05:23.197
lt was the best day we ever had.

05:23.365 --> 05:24.782
Do you always carry this with you?

05:24.866 --> 05:29.453
Yeah. So l guess l'm a freak, too.
And if Jake Slater doesn't like you,

05:29.538 --> 05:31.747
because you carry a pouch
full of baby teeth, then...

05:32.749 --> 05:34.000
Well, you understand why, right?

05:38.338 --> 05:39.338
lt's open.

05:40.382 --> 05:41.716
Hey, Charlie. Hey, Sam.

05:41.800 --> 05:45.302
-Hi.
-Hey, Kate. l'm going to go pack.

05:47.389 --> 05:50.683
Why doesn't she like me? Do you think
she knows we're sleeping together?

05:50.809 --> 05:53.728
Nobody knows.
Maybe she's just intimidated by you.

05:54.730 --> 05:58.274
That's cool. So, why am l here?

05:58.942 --> 06:01.986
Because l want to ask you to help me
with my sleep deprivation project.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.530
l need another psychologist there
to supervise the group for a few hours

06:04.614 --> 06:05.990
while l rest so l can be fresh for the session.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.701
Well, l would, but you're not still going
through with that, are you?

06:08.785 --> 06:12.788
Kate, Kate. This is breakthrough research
and really positive for my patients.

06:12.998 --> 06:14.040
Breakthrough research?

06:14.124 --> 06:16.834
Somebody wants to get into the
Journal of Applied Psychology.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.836
But my primary concern is my patients.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.672
Come on, Charlie.
You're desperate for recognition.

06:21.757 --> 06:24.633
You can't play baseball anymore,
so you're trying to get it in psychotherapy.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.428
So? What's wrong with wanting to be known
as the best in your profession?

06:27.596 --> 06:30.431
Because you're experimenting on
human beings and sleep deprivation

06:30.515 --> 06:33.601
is not a recognized therapeutic tool.
God, you can be so stubborn.

06:33.685 --> 06:37.605
l am not being stubborn. l'm laying
the foundation for a new methodology.

06:37.773 --> 06:39.774
And, for the record,
you're a therapeutic tool.

06:41.568 --> 06:42.943
Drat. Outwitted.

06:45.781 --> 06:48.866
Hey, Charlie. Hey, Kate. Sam ready to go?

06:48.950 --> 06:52.161
She's upstairs grabbing her bag, and thanks
again for taking her on my weekend.

06:52.329 --> 06:54.455
Well, it's probably a good idea
she's not here

06:54.539 --> 06:56.874
for your crazy people
stay-up-all-night party.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.043
l mean, l'm not a professional,

06:59.127 --> 07:02.379
but seems to me that unstable people
need as much sleep as possible.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.799
Right. Get some rest.

07:11.807 --> 07:15.309
You know, there's something l've been
wanting to say to you for a long time.

07:15.477 --> 07:16.644
Yeah?

07:16.812 --> 07:19.814
lt's really stupid, but for the longest time

07:19.898 --> 07:22.149
l thought you and Charlie
had the hots for each other.

07:22.818 --> 07:23.984
You're kidding.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.654
l know. lt's crazy. l mean, you're gay, right?

07:30.992 --> 07:35.996
l mean, l'm not "gay" gay.
l mean, l like to live in the moment.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.167
You're so cool. We should hang out.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.592
Patrick, you're early.

07:48.969 --> 07:53.430
Didn't realize traffic was going to be so
light, but since l'm the first person here

07:53.515 --> 07:57.017
for our "no sleepover,"
l'll just take the couch.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.897
Patrick, if you want the couch, just say
you got here early to take the couch.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.608
Nobody is going to be petty enough
to compete with you for the couch.

08:04.693 --> 08:07.736
Damn it! l wanted the couch.

08:10.949 --> 08:13.492
Crap! The couch is gone.

08:13.577 --> 08:16.036
l told you if l let you pick me up,
you had to be on time.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.289
l'm sorry.
l've never been to your house before.

08:18.373 --> 08:20.708
Please. l've seen you parked outside
my house for hours.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.419
Well, not in daytime.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.134
Okay, guys. As you can see,
l've set up a few cameras around

08:30.218 --> 08:31.302
to document the workshop.

08:32.387 --> 08:34.638
Whoa. l did not agree to be filmed.

08:34.723 --> 08:37.391
Okay, then l will make sure that no footage
of you winds up in my presentation.

08:38.059 --> 08:41.562
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
l did not agree not to be filmed.

08:43.607 --> 08:46.775
Okay. We've all been up for about 1 2 hours,
but most sleep deprivation symptoms

08:46.860 --> 08:50.279
don't kick in until after 36.
So we'll start the session tomorrow night.

08:50.655 --> 08:53.490
Until then, the only rule is to stay awake.

08:55.327 --> 08:56.869
Ed, wake up.

08:57.662 --> 08:59.622
Ed? Ed!

08:59.706 --> 09:01.415
Oh, my God. He's not breathing.

09:04.628 --> 09:06.921
You hit your feet, you lose your seat.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.718
l think l can trace a lot of my anger
back to the moment

09:12.802 --> 09:14.220
l found out my mother died.

09:15.931 --> 09:18.224
l was in the back of a cab with my brother.

09:19.184 --> 09:24.271
He hung up the phone, he turned to me
and he said, "Mom's dead."

09:27.067 --> 09:28.943
There was nothing in his eyes.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.987
lt was like he didn't even care.

09:32.447 --> 09:35.699
l said, "What's the matter with you?
Our mother is dead!"

09:35.784 --> 09:37.534
You know what? That sucked. Okay.

09:39.955 --> 09:44.124
Patrick, we're 24 hours in. You've been
in front of the camera for half of that.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.795
So far your mother has died in a cab,
on a train, in a plane, in a boat.

09:47.963 --> 09:51.131
The only place she hasn't died
is in a box with a fox.

09:51.466 --> 09:52.925
Stop rehearsing your breakthrough.

09:55.136 --> 09:56.512
Ed, what was that?

09:56.638 --> 10:01.558
l was playing the video bowling game
and the controller slipped out of my hand.

10:01.685 --> 10:03.644
l think l'm losing my muscle control.

10:04.521 --> 10:07.314
That's great!
That's the third sign of sleep deprivation.

10:07.399 --> 10:08.440
What's the first one?

10:08.525 --> 10:10.901
Unsubstantiated euphoria. Yes!

10:12.988 --> 10:15.155
Kate should be here any minute
to cover for me.

10:17.242 --> 10:19.785
l'm cold. Nolan, give me your blanket.

10:20.161 --> 10:22.329
Sure. Here you go.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.877
Hey, Patrick?
What do you think about me and Lacey?

10:29.504 --> 10:30.754
Yeah, not a big fan.

10:32.424 --> 10:34.216
l mean, could you see us together?

10:34.301 --> 10:36.510
The only way that happens
is if she's robbing a gas station

10:36.594 --> 10:38.053
and using you as a human shield.

10:38.847 --> 10:41.974
But you do see us together. Cool.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.979
Thank God you're here.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.230
l'm leaving.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.983
What do you mean you're leaving?
l have to get some sleep before the session.

10:51.067 --> 10:54.111
l have a client who's having a breakdown.
She's at the hospital.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.279
Okay. This may sound a little harsh,

10:55.363 --> 10:57.489
but can't they just strap her to a gurney,
pump her full of drugs,

10:57.574 --> 11:00.617
and let her ride it out?
You know, kicking it old-school?

11:00.702 --> 11:02.411
l have to sign her in.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.829
So you'll be gone, what, a couple of hours?

11:03.913 --> 11:04.955
The family is committing her.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.750
The paperwork takes forever.
That's why we never did it with my mom.

11:07.834 --> 11:11.378
lt was easier to just let her
run around the house naked, covered in jam.

11:12.881 --> 11:15.549
Okay. l really can't process that right now.

11:15.633 --> 11:20.220
But if you're not back in time, l'll have to do
the session on 36 hours of no sleep.

11:20.555 --> 11:24.892
l'm sorry, but your muscle coordination
seems fine, your pupils are responsive,

11:25.268 --> 11:28.228
and you're showing no signs
of unsubstantiated euphoria.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.689
Look, let me just go and l will
get back as fast as l can.

11:30.774 --> 11:33.067
You will? You will?

11:43.495 --> 11:44.703
Hey.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.080
Yeah?

11:46.164 --> 11:49.917
So it's been almost 36 hours.
How you doing?

11:50.085 --> 11:53.837
Not good. l think l just texted a picture
of my boobs to my dentist.

11:57.425 --> 12:00.844
What a coincidence. He wants me
to come in tomorrow for a cleaning.

12:03.056 --> 12:06.892
So, anyway, l was thinking,
if you're not doing anything,

12:06.976 --> 12:08.769
l hear there's pizza in the kitchen.

12:08.853 --> 12:12.272
Do you want to go?
Or l could just bring you a piece.

12:12.357 --> 12:14.441
l don't want you touching my food.
l'll get it myself.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.194
Great. lt's a date.

12:20.573 --> 12:25.994
We got a great table.
Only problem is it's so close to the kitchen.

12:32.127 --> 12:33.377
Give me a Coke.

12:33.545 --> 12:34.670
Okay.

12:48.059 --> 12:49.309
This will be fine.

12:51.062 --> 12:52.438
That was funny.

12:53.481 --> 12:56.984
Thanks. When l'm tired, l'm really funny.

13:00.363 --> 13:01.363
Fork.

13:04.993 --> 13:08.871
Hey, guys. l'm going to make
some more coffee. What's so funny?

13:08.955 --> 13:11.665
This fork was being hilarious.

13:13.334 --> 13:17.963
All right. Giddy and mildly delusional.
l think we're getting real close to a session.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.215
Really? Already?

13:21.384 --> 13:24.761
l must have completely lost track of time.
This was great.

13:24.846 --> 13:29.475
l hope we can do this again.
l'm going to go splash some pee on my face.

13:31.728 --> 13:35.856
Face on my pee. l will see you later.

13:36.357 --> 13:37.691
And l meant water.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.744
lt's a crazy night, huh?

13:49.370 --> 13:50.454
You holding up okay?

13:50.538 --> 13:54.541
Yeah. You've got something right there.

13:55.710 --> 13:56.793
Did l get it?

13:56.878 --> 13:58.921
No. Here, let me.

14:01.049 --> 14:03.008
Lacey, you can't do that!

14:03.218 --> 14:06.094
l'm sorry. l'm sorry. l meant to do this.

14:07.805 --> 14:13.727
That's the same thing! Lacey. Lacey.
You have to stop this. You're exhausted.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.687
What's going on right now
is called transference.

14:15.772 --> 14:18.690
l'm going to get a tattoo of you
somewhere special,

14:18.775 --> 14:22.110
and if you grow a little beard,
it will look perfect.

14:25.406 --> 14:28.325
You're having these emotions because you
feel like l'm the only man in your life

14:28.409 --> 14:30.327
who listens to you and cares
about you right now.

14:31.246 --> 14:37.334
Oh, my God. You're right.
What am l doing? This is so embarrassing.

14:38.670 --> 14:42.506
lt's okay. Sorry. Nobody will know.
You're tired.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.007
You don't know what you're doing.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.259
Yes, l do.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.053
Okay, you do a little bit.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.975
You've clearly lost all your inhibitions.
lt's time to get started.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.351
Great.

14:54.435 --> 14:55.519
With the session.

14:59.065 --> 15:02.276
Okay, everyone.
Time for the session. Let's do this.

15:02.485 --> 15:04.403
Ed, please turn off the bowling game.

15:04.487 --> 15:05.862
All right. Fine.

15:10.285 --> 15:15.747
Okay. l think we're at a point now where
we have the opportunity

15:17.208 --> 15:20.210
to get beneath the surface of some issues
we've all been wrestling with.

15:21.879 --> 15:25.299
Please, Ed. Tell me you're still bowling.

15:28.303 --> 15:30.137
-Who would like to start?
-l would.

15:30.471 --> 15:33.849
Two years ago, l was in New York.
l was in the back of the cab and my brother

15:33.933 --> 15:34.933
got a phone call.

15:35.018 --> 15:36.810
Does anybody have something real?

15:37.854 --> 15:40.022
l would like to talk about something real.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.316
Okay, but remember,
even though we're in therapy,

15:42.400 --> 15:45.235
there are some things
that nobody wants to hear about.

15:45.737 --> 15:50.324
You'll want to hear this.
l've had a lot of boyfriends break up with me

15:50.408 --> 15:52.701
because they say l'm too sexual.

15:52.827 --> 15:57.039
Well, stuff happens.
Nolan, you've been quiet.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.751
Actually, l really want to hear
what Lacey has to say.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.086
-Me, too.
-Sing it.

16:07.425 --> 16:10.761
When l want someone,
l just have to have them.

16:10.845 --> 16:13.847
And l tell them nothing's off-limits.

16:14.140 --> 16:17.934
You can't hurt me. ls that unusual, Charlie?

16:18.019 --> 16:21.188
ls there something wrong with me?

16:23.191 --> 16:27.486
You seeing what l'm seeing?
That is an unusual way to sit, right?

16:31.699 --> 16:34.368
Okay. Lacey, let's get into this.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.329
Your sexually provocative behavior
is probably just you

16:37.413 --> 16:39.706
trying to fill an emotional void
left behind from your childhood.

16:39.791 --> 16:44.711
Wow. Void. Someone likes to talk dirty
with people watching.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.799
She's a complete slut.

16:48.966 --> 16:51.176
l could have told you that from the shoes.

16:53.554 --> 16:57.057
l'm going to go get some pizza.
You remember pizza?

17:02.605 --> 17:05.315
Looks like your ship
is taking on water, captain.

17:05.483 --> 17:08.735
Not helping, Ed. People are just getting
into some more difficult truths.

17:08.820 --> 17:11.822
Lacey is this close to realizing that she
doesn't need to use sex to get love.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.448
l use love to get sex.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.952
Love is empty and meaningless,
and sex lasts forever.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.833
Two down, two to go.
Time to call in a Mayday.

17:22.917 --> 17:24.000
Ed, please.

17:24.085 --> 17:27.587
Everyone is experiencing emotions but me.
Why can't l feel anything real?

17:27.672 --> 17:29.715
This isn't even real.

17:31.259 --> 17:35.137
You just hit the iceberg, boy.
This whole thing is going down.

17:35.346 --> 17:37.180
lf l were you, l would call it a day.

17:37.265 --> 17:38.306
l know what l'm doing.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.391
The hell you do.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.268
Shut up, Dad!

17:44.981 --> 17:46.273
l apologize for "shut up."

17:47.108 --> 17:50.360
l'm going to need a few minutes
in the kitchen to figure out "Dad."

17:56.993 --> 17:58.493
You okay?

17:59.787 --> 18:02.247
l tried to be objective
and l wind up yelling at a patient.

18:02.331 --> 18:07.085
Come on, Charlie. Wake up.
Look what happened here.

18:07.336 --> 18:12.007
You called one of your patients Dad. Freud
would be creaming his jeans over that.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.384
Freud wouldn't wearjeans. He wore a slip.

18:14.469 --> 18:18.430
A Freudian slip. l'm so tired.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.392
But your hypothesis was correct.

18:22.477 --> 18:25.270
The inhibitions came down
and the truth came out.

18:25.563 --> 18:26.646
Yeah, for me.

18:26.731 --> 18:27.898
Nobody else had a breakthrough?

18:27.982 --> 18:31.485
Lacey cried, Nolan yelled, and Patrick
realized he's avoiding his real emotions.

18:31.569 --> 18:35.071
That is huge!
And what did you realize about your dad?

18:36.324 --> 18:38.325
l don't know. What did l realize?

18:38.409 --> 18:39.576
Wake up!

18:40.745 --> 18:43.497
Ed, he's on my ass just like my dad's
been my whole life.

18:43.581 --> 18:44.998
l've never been good enough for him.

18:45.082 --> 18:47.542
And?

18:47.627 --> 18:48.877
Wake up!

18:51.506 --> 18:54.299
Now it's just about hitting me, isn't it?

18:54.926 --> 18:58.595
Why did you do this study?
Who do you want recognition from?

18:58.679 --> 19:00.597
Have you asked yourself
even one of these questions?

19:00.681 --> 19:02.974
Well, not yet. Someone has been
slapping the crap out of me.

19:03.059 --> 19:08.438
Okay. l'm still trying to make my dad proud.
That's what this whole thing was about.

19:10.441 --> 19:13.193
Why can't l be a normal person
and just want to have sex with my mom?

19:18.533 --> 19:23.370
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.
Except it's eggables and tofacon.

19:27.542 --> 19:30.544
Ed, l'm very sorry about last night.
l was really burnt.

19:30.753 --> 19:33.213
Good, because l was afraid
you were going to come over here

19:33.297 --> 19:35.340
and ask me to take you fishing
or something.

19:37.051 --> 19:39.511
lf you want to go to
a strip club, l'd be up for that.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.680
No, no.

19:42.223 --> 19:43.557
Here's your blanket.

19:44.392 --> 19:48.144
Keep it. Someday when you're lying
in your bed with it wrapped around you,

19:48.229 --> 19:50.355
l want you to think about what
could have been.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.275
Just take your stupid blanket.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.241
You okay?

20:01.325 --> 20:04.578
Yeah. Whatever l did last night,
don't take it seriously. l was crazy.

20:04.662 --> 20:06.329
We all got a little crazy last night.

20:06.998 --> 20:10.333
l was thinking about what you said,

20:10.418 --> 20:13.879
and l may have some anger stuff
from when l was a kid,

20:13.963 --> 20:16.214
stuff from my dad leaving or whatever.

20:16.299 --> 20:21.678
Welcome to the club. This is a penny
my dad made for me at Carlsbad Caverns.

20:22.763 --> 20:26.182
lt's actually the last great time l remember
us ever having together.

20:26.851 --> 20:28.018
l keep it for good luck.

20:30.146 --> 20:33.899
So it reminds you that, even though you
have issues with your parents,

20:33.983 --> 20:35.275
you can move past them?

20:35.401 --> 20:36.401
Exactly.

20:37.612 --> 20:39.112
Thanks. Hope it works.

20:42.742 --> 20:46.620
lsn't that the coin you have been carrying
around for 35 years?

20:47.705 --> 20:48.788
Yeah.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.000
Did you mean to give it to her?

20:52.585 --> 20:53.585
No.

20:58.007 --> 20:59.507
How are you feeling?

20:59.926 --> 21:01.051
Sad.

21:05.431 --> 21:08.141
Do you want me to take
you to Carlsbad Caverns?

21:09.143 --> 21:11.227
ls that a euphemism for something else?

21:11.479 --> 21:12.687
Yes.

21:13.147 --> 21:14.439
Then, yes.
