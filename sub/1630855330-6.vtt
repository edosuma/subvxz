13:44.911 --> 13:47.000
Ah, okay.
That's what this is.

13:47.043 --> 13:50.220
It was George Kirk, Sr.
First officer of the Kelvin.

13:50.264 --> 13:51.569
Dad gave you his first name,

13:51.613 --> 13:53.006
even if you choose
not to use it,

13:53.049 --> 13:55.747

to keep up.

13:55.790 --> 13:58.228

14:00.840 --> 14:02.929
Sam, what does my ambition
have to do with you?

14:05.148 --> 14:07.890
Dad has a very
old-fashioned idea

14:07.934 --> 14:09.979
of what a successful career
looks like,

14:10.023 --> 14:12.112
what a fulfilling life
looks like,

14:12.155 --> 14:15.028
and it just so happens
it looks a lot like you.

14:15.071 --> 14:17.857
Well, if you're so worried
about impressing Dad,

14:17.900 --> 14:20.163
then why are you wallowing
in a science lab?

14:20.207 --> 14:22.339
Wallowing, seriously?

14:22.383 --> 14:24.341

14:24.385 --> 14:27.823
I put in some legwork
to beat this one. So what?

14:27.867 --> 14:30.043
We can make the old man proud
in our own ways.

14:30.086 --> 14:32.132

14:51.412 --> 14:54.632

14:54.676 --> 14:56.634
We need to send a team
to Deck Five

14:56.678 --> 14:58.375
to get the EPS regulators
back on line.

14:58.419 --> 15:01.074
Yes. Well, that is going
to have to wait.

15:01.117 --> 15:05.208

in the fuel distribution system.

15:05.252 --> 15:08.037

15:51.080 --> 15:52.560

15:52.603 --> 15:54.475
Starfleet is built
on a command hierarchy.

whatever this is.

16:44.612 --> 16:46.048
My point is

16:46.092 --> 16:49.182
if we let Starfleet--

16:49.225 --> 16:51.184
or anyone else,
for that matter--

16:51.227 --> 16:53.795
look inside the box, then...

16:54.796 --> 16:57.059

16:57.103 --> 16:59.192

17:15.946 --> 17:18.166

on the turbolift,

17:18.211 --> 17:20.082
I heard the same sound
that I heard on the bridge,

17:20.126 --> 17:22.650

before I went into the nacelle,

17:22.693 --> 17:24.694

to deuterium.

17:24.739 --> 17:27.220
You believe your hallucinations
began on the bridge.

17:27.262 --> 17:29.352

17:29.396 --> 17:31.267

41:07.856 --> 41:10.990
There was damage to the language
center of his brain.

41:11.033 --> 41:14.384
My brain scan shows elevated
activity in the same spot.

41:14.428 --> 41:17.692
And we were both hearing
that same sound.

41:17.736 --> 41:20.608
What if someone or something

41:20.652 --> 41:23.263
was trying to communicate
with him,

41:23.306 --> 41:24.656
with me,

41:24.699 --> 41:26.440
but their signal's too strong?

41:27.659 --> 41:31.706
So strong it that burned out
that area of his brain entirely.

41:31.750 --> 41:33.447
It's a message from some...

41:34.970 --> 41:36.406
...invisible alien?

41:39.584 --> 41:41.542
You want to talk to Sam,
don't you?

41:42.587 --> 41:43.936
SAM:
Your symptoms started
once we arrived

41:43.979 --> 41:46.286
in the nebula, right?

41:46.329 --> 41:48.941
So it makes sense that our
mystery alien would live here.

41:48.984 --> 41:51.291
But our sensors aren't
showing any life-forms.

41:51.334 --> 41:52.945
Well, there's a theory--

41:52.988 --> 41:55.251
it's a little bit fringe,
but hear me out--

41:55.295 --> 41:57.297
that extra-dimensional
life-forms

41:57.340 --> 41:59.778
could actually
poke into our space

41:59.821 --> 42:02.824
and attach themselves
to atoms from our dimension.

42:02.868 --> 42:04.783
Meaning they aren't
sophisticated life-forms

42:04.826 --> 42:07.568
capable of speech
or even language.

42:07.612 --> 42:09.570
There are similarities

42:09.614 --> 42:13.095
in the ways different species
process thoughts, ideas.

42:13.139 --> 42:14.749
That's how the universal
translator works--

42:14.793 --> 42:16.969
by recognizing
those similarities.

42:17.012 --> 42:20.538
Maybe my brain
is doing the same thing?

42:20.581 --> 42:22.714
Invisible aliens
are using your brain

42:22.757 --> 42:24.411
as a universal translator.

42:24.454 --> 42:26.848
It might be the only way
they know how to communicate.

42:26.892 --> 42:29.895
They send simple ideas to
the language center of my brain,

42:29.938 --> 42:32.245
then my brain interprets

42:32.288 --> 42:34.160
those ideas the only way
it can--

42:34.203 --> 42:36.771
through my thoughts,
my memories.

42:36.815 --> 42:38.381
The visions,

42:38.425 --> 42:41.210
they're like vocabulary.

42:41.254 --> 42:42.908
What are they trying to say?

42:46.868 --> 42:49.392
UHURA:
I felt the walls closing in
because they feel

42:49.436 --> 42:50.872
trapped.

42:52.134 --> 42:54.833
I was attacking myself because

42:54.876 --> 42:56.922
we're responsible.

42:57.923 --> 42:59.446
They showed me
the ship exploding

42:59.489 --> 43:01.013

43:01.056 --> 43:03.189

43:04.364 --> 43:06.235
We're killing them.

43:06.279 --> 43:08.063
We're killing
the ones they love,

43:08.107 --> 43:09.543

43:09.587 --> 43:11.632
And that's what
they're making me feel.

43:13.286 --> 43:15.636
If they're living in the nebula,
in the deuterium...

43:15.680 --> 43:18.073
In a way,
they are the deuterium.

43:18.117 --> 43:20.075
So, then when
we pull the deuterium

43:20.119 --> 43:21.860
out of the nebula
into our nacelles,

43:21.903 --> 43:24.210

processes and refines it...
