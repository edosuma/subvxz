Jake, I want to ask you
something, and it
stays between us.

00:15.521 --> 00:18.478
What do you know about
Russian-Palestinian relations?

00:18.521 --> 00:19.652
VANCE:
Sergei Mishnev.

00:19.695 --> 00:22.173
Our intel says Sergei survived.

00:22.217 --> 00:23.260
How? I hit him.

00:23.304 --> 00:24.739
He went down.He got up.

00:24.782 --> 00:25.956
What?
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.521

00:32.391 --> 00:34.739
Only the beginning,
my friend.

Well, you know the deal
with them two, don't you?

00:42.260 --> 00:44.956
Them two who?

00:45.000 --> 00:46.434
Judge McGraff?

00:46.478 --> 00:47.739
And Wilson, the D.A.

00:47.782 --> 00:49.130
The two of them used to be
college sweethearts.

00:49.173 --> 00:50.565
Is that a fact?Check 'em out

00:50.608 --> 00:51.739
next time you're in court--

00:51.782 --> 00:53.391
little looks
between 'em, smiles.

He objects, she sustains,
every time.The old flame's

00:56.391 --> 00:58.130
still burning, huh?I think they'd
burn it up

00:58.173 --> 01:00.043
right there on the bench
if they could.

01:00.086 --> 01:02.347
Keyes, you are bad.

01:02.391 --> 01:03.956
Not as bad as this yahoo.

License and registration,
please.

01:29.956 --> 01:31.608
[knocking on window]

01:37.000 --> 01:39.304
What do we have there?

01:40.565 --> 01:42.565
It's okay.

01:42.608 --> 01:45.434
It's prescription bourbon.

01:47.826 --> 01:49.347
[exhales]

02:23.304 --> 02:25.043
You know,
all fairness to alcohol,

02:25.086 --> 02:27.869
I've done stupid things
when I was sober, too.

02:27.913 --> 02:30.347
I'm glad you think
it's funny.It's not.

02:30.391 --> 02:32.478
But it's nothing
I wanted my daughter

02:32.521 --> 02:35.869
or anybody down at the Bureau to
make a big deal about, either.

02:35.913 --> 02:37.434
So you called me?

02:37.478 --> 02:40.260
I figured I could count on you
for the shortest lecture.

02:40.304 --> 02:41.608
Bourbon... Tobias?

02:41.652 --> 02:42.739
Yeah. I barely
cracked it.

02:42.782 --> 02:44.086
It was mainly the beer
I had with dinner

02:44.130 --> 02:45.695
mixed with the pain medicine
I still take

02:45.739 --> 02:47.130
for when you
shot me in the ass.

02:47.173 --> 02:49.043
It smarts like hell
in cold weather.No, no.

02:49.086 --> 02:50.695
I saw the police report.

02:50.739 --> 02:51.956
That was a fluke thing,

02:52.000 --> 02:54.956
which I intend to learn from
and put behind me.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.869
And if you were my friend,
you'd do the same thing.

02:57.913 --> 03:00.086
[phone ringing]

03:00.130 --> 03:02.000
Yeah, Leon?

03:03.391 --> 03:05.913
Uh-huh.

03:05.956 --> 03:07.086
Where?

03:07.130 --> 03:08.826
What's up?

03:10.652 --> 03:12.434
Let me know
if you need me, Gibbs.

03:12.478 --> 03:15.086
I owe you one.No, you don't!

03:15.130 --> 03:17.130
[chuckles softly]

03:26.173 --> 03:27.217
NCIS.

03:27.260 --> 03:28.782
Gibbs.

03:28.826 --> 03:32.000
Fire's out. Your team
just got here. Wardroom.

03:32.043 --> 03:34.260
Are you still thinking
gas explosion?Well, I'm hoping.

03:34.304 --> 03:35.521
Galley's one
compartment over.

03:35.565 --> 03:37.739
We're thinking maybe
a leaky stove or an oven.

03:37.782 --> 03:39.043
Who are
all these suits?

03:39.086 --> 03:41.043
Dignitaries from a dozen
international agencies.

03:41.086 --> 03:43.043
We'd just started boarding
when this happened.

03:43.086 --> 03:44.739
But there were
a bunch of crew members

03:44.782 --> 03:45.913
in there setting up.

03:45.956 --> 03:47.391
SECNAV?On the West Coast--
we were

03:47.434 --> 03:49.565
patching her in
on closed circuit.What's the occasion?

03:49.608 --> 03:50.913
It's a summit
on global terror.

03:50.956 --> 03:52.043
No irony there.

03:52.086 --> 03:54.043
I'm not going there, Gibbs.

03:54.086 --> 03:56.043
Keep thinking
gas leak.

03:56.086 --> 03:58.739
[camera shutter clicks]

03:58.782 --> 04:01.043
Welcome
to the party, boss.

04:02.521 --> 04:03.913
Casualties.

04:03.956 --> 04:07.000
Uh, six reported injured,
two are in sick bay,

04:07.043 --> 04:10.043
two more seriously being
rushed to Norfolk Memorial.

04:10.086 --> 04:11.695
[sighs]:
And one dead.

04:11.739 --> 04:12.956
Female petty officer.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.695
Can't make out
her name tag.

04:14.739 --> 04:16.304
I'll call Ducky.

04:16.347 --> 04:18.913
This is
no gas explosion.Yeah.

04:18.956 --> 04:21.043
We had our doubts.There's no
smell of gas.

04:21.086 --> 04:23.956
Just gunpowder.TONY: And then
there's this.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.782
Bomb fragment?

04:28.956 --> 04:31.782
It's in Russian--
it says "grenade."Just because

04:31.826 --> 04:33.434
it's in Russian
doesn't mean it's...

04:36.130 --> 04:37.347
Sergei Mishnev.

04:37.391 --> 04:38.956
We knew he wasn't
done yet, Gibbs--

04:39.000 --> 04:41.347
just a matter of time.This means you're the target.

04:41.391 --> 04:42.826
Any friend of yours

04:42.869 --> 04:45.000
is an enemy of his.

04:45.043 --> 04:46.913
Let me check the guest list.

04:47.956 --> 04:50.782
The Russian ambassador
had to cancel,

04:50.826 --> 04:54.173
so they sent someone
in his place.Someone we know?

04:54.217 --> 04:56.391
Another friend.

04:58.956 --> 05:00.434
Director Vance.

05:00.478 --> 05:01.869
Agent Gibbs.

05:01.913 --> 05:03.391
VANCE:
Counselor Pavlenko.Thank goodness

05:03.434 --> 05:04.434
you're all right.

05:04.478 --> 05:06.000
I just heard
about the explosion.

05:06.043 --> 05:07.000
Interesting
you being late.

05:07.043 --> 05:07.869
Was anyone hurt?

05:07.913 --> 05:09.043
Do we know what happened?

05:09.086 --> 05:11.652
Wehave a pretty good idea.

05:12.695 --> 05:15.391
A bomb?A Russian grenade.

05:15.434 --> 05:17.652
You think Sergei?You don't?

05:17.695 --> 05:20.000
And here you are conveniently
rolling in after the fact.

05:20.043 --> 05:21.260
Gentlemen, please,
do not tell me

05:21.304 --> 05:23.608
we're going to engage
in this farce yet again.

05:23.652 --> 05:24.608
You have to admit, Counselor...

05:24.652 --> 05:26.391
I admit nothing.

05:26.434 --> 05:28.391
In fact, let me
assure you, Director,

05:28.434 --> 05:29.869
if Sergei

05:29.913 --> 05:32.478
is behind this,
Iwas his target.

05:33.130 --> 05:34.304
Not you.

05:34.347 --> 05:36.956
Not Agent Gibbs. Me.

05:51.086 --> 05:53.391
PAVLENKO:
I cannot believe I am forced
to defend myself once again

05:53.434 --> 05:54.695
for the actions of a criminal.

05:54.739 --> 05:56.043
A Russian criminal,
Counselor,

05:56.086 --> 05:58.000
with whom you once had
a working relationship.

05:58.043 --> 05:59.869
Once, Director.
And we have paid dearly

05:59.913 --> 06:03.217
for that mistake, leaving Sergei
now a man without a country.

06:03.260 --> 06:04.565
Freeing you up to
play the victim.

06:04.608 --> 06:06.782
Not a victim, Gibbs--
a target, like you.

06:06.826 --> 06:09.173
For reasons that make sense
only to Sergei.

06:09.217 --> 06:10.521
Reasons such as?

06:10.565 --> 06:11.782
Your helicopter crash.

06:11.826 --> 06:14.391
He saw my help in the rescue
as a betrayal.

06:14.434 --> 06:15.173
Help?

06:15.217 --> 06:16.304
And now he perceives

06:16.347 --> 06:18.173
that I owe my life
to Agent Gibbs

06:18.217 --> 06:20.826
for saving me from our
defector, the scientist.

06:20.869 --> 06:22.739
You shoot Nelly Benin dead,

06:22.782 --> 06:25.130
and now we're
practically golf buddies.

06:25.173 --> 06:26.173
I don't golf.

06:26.217 --> 06:27.521
Well... who has time?

06:27.565 --> 06:28.739
I mean, really.

06:30.086 --> 06:31.043
Gibbs,

06:31.086 --> 06:32.869
my sympathy for your loss--

06:32.913 --> 06:34.826
I have suffered a few myself--

06:34.869 --> 06:36.739
but we are in this together.

06:36.782 --> 06:38.130
No, we're not.

06:38.173 --> 06:40.434
All due respect, Counselor,
you created this monster.

06:40.478 --> 06:41.478
Don't fool yourself, Director.

06:41.521 --> 06:43.869
Many hands went into
creating Sergei.

06:43.913 --> 06:45.391
Now, please,
tell me what I can do.

06:45.434 --> 06:47.130
What can I say, Gibbs,
to convince you

06:47.173 --> 06:48.565
that I am on your side here?

06:48.608 --> 06:51.478
You stay out of my way.

06:56.043 --> 06:58.565

07:00.217 --> 07:04.565
Tell me about it.Eager to serve, to learn,

07:04.608 --> 07:08.565
to see the world and experience
its many adventures.

of the grenade fragments.

Looks like only one was used.Get everything

07:41.043 --> 07:43.826
Well, we were just
about to get started.

07:43.869 --> 07:45.173
TONY: Sick bay just
gave us clearance.

07:45.217 --> 07:46.391
We're just waiting to hear
from the hospital.

Sick bay-- that's where
we start. Let's go.

07:47.652 --> 07:49.521
Come on,
let's move.

07:52.173 --> 07:53.608
We can handle it.

07:53.652 --> 07:55.043
What?Bishop and I

07:55.086 --> 07:56.695
can handle the interviews--
might be better.

07:56.739 --> 07:58.347
Better?

07:58.391 --> 08:00.478
What's better, DiNozzo?

08:00.521 --> 08:02.434
What are you trying
to say? Spit it out.

Only to call certain people.

08:25.521 --> 08:27.086
I need to see you right away.

08:27.130 --> 08:30.434
Get you a soda or some
water or something, Em?

08:30.478 --> 08:33.695
No. I just had a low-foam latte,
and this won't take long.

08:33.739 --> 08:36.000
I've got debate
quarterfinals in an hour.

08:38.521 --> 08:40.478
Arguing's pretty much
in my blood.

We could have done
this over the phone.No, we couldn't.

08:43.826 --> 08:46.434
I know about you bailing out
my dad this morning.

08:46.478 --> 08:48.652
Wasn't exactly
bailing him out.

a tough time.Don't soft-pedal me,

08:52.304 --> 08:54.434
He looks nuts
with that bald head.

08:54.478 --> 08:56.391
It's an undercover
operation.

08:56.434 --> 08:57.695
You don't believe that.

Last week he shaved it
twice in one day.

he's drinking way too much.

You know what
he's experiencing.

I try to help,

to work through.

How's that going?Some good days...
some awful.

No, not you.

20:11.956 --> 20:13.043
Jake. He just called.

20:13.086 --> 20:14.304
You know that dinner

20:14.347 --> 20:16.043
he and Gibbs ended up
having last week?

20:16.086 --> 20:17.086
The one that you
and Tony ditched.

20:17.130 --> 20:19.130
We did not ditch.
We were working.

20:19.173 --> 20:21.956
But it did leave
them to be BFFs.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.739
More than any of us realized.

20:23.782 --> 20:26.695
Apparently, Gibbs
asked Jake to share intel.

20:26.739 --> 20:29.739
Everything NSA has on
Russian-Palestinian relations.

20:29.782 --> 20:32.000
Sergei Mishnev,
Anton Pavlenko...

20:32.043 --> 20:33.347
He didn't say anything
to us about it.

20:33.391 --> 20:35.000
Because he didn't want us
or anyone knowing.

20:35.043 --> 20:37.086
But how could Jake not tell me?

20:37.130 --> 20:40.347
Well, that's a marriage thing,
but it sounds like he just did.

20:40.391 --> 20:41.869
Only because Gibbs called
early this morning

20:41.913 --> 20:43.652
and told Jake to send us
everything he had

20:43.695 --> 20:45.739
and that we would know
what to do with it.

20:45.782 --> 20:47.913
Oh. Could that be
part of a plan?[cell phone chiming]

20:47.956 --> 20:49.434
Well, the e-mail
just came through.

20:49.478 --> 20:50.782
It's a huge file.

20:50.826 --> 20:52.608
Let's go.

21:05.521 --> 21:07.695
I dumped it.

21:08.739 --> 21:10.043
What?

21:10.086 --> 21:12.608
The bourbon-- it's gone.

21:12.652 --> 21:14.565
What are you, my mother?

21:14.608 --> 21:15.826
What are you trying to prove?

21:17.478 --> 21:18.913
I don't need you
monitoring my intake.

21:18.956 --> 21:20.565
Ah, it seems to me you do.

21:20.608 --> 21:22.347
Well, I don't.

21:22.391 --> 21:24.043
And I don't need this.

21:24.086 --> 21:26.956
Yeah, well, neither do I...

21:27.000 --> 21:28.652
but here we are.

21:28.695 --> 21:30.565
[cup clatters on floor]

21:30.608 --> 21:32.391
I'm done.

21:32.434 --> 21:34.695
"Done." With what?

21:36.217 --> 21:37.695
Embarrassing yourself?

21:37.739 --> 21:40.173
Or-or maybe you mean
embarrassing the badge.

21:40.217 --> 21:41.695
You've done a good job at both.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.043
Oh...

21:47.086 --> 21:49.608
That all you got, Alice?

21:49.652 --> 21:51.608
Yah!

21:52.608 --> 21:53.478
[grunts]

21:53.521 --> 21:55.652
[coughs]

21:59.086 --> 22:00.565
Do you feel better?

22:02.695 --> 22:05.391
We should be in D.C.
looking for Sergei.

22:05.434 --> 22:06.521
Not in this
condition.

22:08.869 --> 22:12.086
Geez, forget
about Sergei.

22:12.130 --> 22:14.304
What's really
bothering you?

22:14.347 --> 22:15.739
Don't Freud me, Gibbs.
You're not qualified.

22:15.782 --> 22:17.478
You know what
I'm asking.

22:17.521 --> 22:19.043
Back off.You blame me.

22:19.086 --> 22:20.304
Jethro...

22:20.347 --> 22:21.304
It's okay, Tobias.

22:21.347 --> 22:22.304
I blame me.

22:22.347 --> 22:23.956
I'm the one who got her killed.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.130
[sighs]

22:26.173 --> 22:27.826
If Diane wasn't
on that rooftop,

22:27.869 --> 22:29.739
she would be alive.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.782
And you wouldn't
be walking around

22:31.826 --> 22:33.652
pretending like I wasn't
the one who put her there.

22:33.695 --> 22:34.913
So it's all about you.Yeah.

22:34.956 --> 22:36.000
It is all about me.

22:36.043 --> 22:37.391
And it's about you,

22:37.434 --> 22:39.173
and it's about Diane,
and it's about

22:39.217 --> 22:40.869
the drinking, and
it's about all of it.

22:40.913 --> 22:42.434
No, my friend.

22:42.478 --> 22:44.043
It's just me.

22:44.086 --> 22:45.913
I killed her.

22:45.956 --> 22:47.782
No one to blame but myself.

22:52.478 --> 22:55.478
And now I really need a drink.

22:55.521 --> 22:57.869
[sighs]

22:57.913 --> 23:00.434
That NSA intel give us anything?

23:00.478 --> 23:02.565
Oh, we are just
getting started, Director,

23:02.608 --> 23:04.913
and there is a whole lot
to comb through.

23:04.956 --> 23:07.434
Stuff in here about
the Soviets in Afghanistan,

23:07.478 --> 23:08.652
the mujahideen...

23:08.695 --> 23:10.695
Wait a second.
Got something about Sergei

23:10.739 --> 23:12.478
and the Russian Counselor
Pavlenko.

23:12.521 --> 23:13.782
Our "friend" Anton.

23:13.826 --> 23:15.434
What is it?They go way back.

23:15.478 --> 23:17.086
All the way to college.

23:17.130 --> 23:19.043
They competed at
Saint Petersburg University

23:19.086 --> 23:20.478
in the biathlon.

23:20.521 --> 23:21.782
Isn't that the one where they
cross-country ski

23:21.826 --> 23:23.130
and shoot rifles?TONY:
Yeah.

23:23.173 --> 23:24.782
As random Olympic sports go,

23:24.826 --> 23:26.608
it's sort of the equivalent of
bullfighting on a trampoline.

23:26.652 --> 23:28.347
That explains a lot.
Go on.

23:28.391 --> 23:30.000
Well, they were friendly rivals
for a while,

23:30.043 --> 23:32.260
contending for
the Soviet Olympic team.

23:32.304 --> 23:33.391
When neither of them
made the cut,

23:33.434 --> 23:34.913
Pavlenko went
to law school

23:34.956 --> 23:37.434
and Sergei discovered
the Afghan heroin trade.

23:37.478 --> 23:38.521
Explains even more.

23:38.565 --> 23:39.565
Like his soft spot

23:39.608 --> 23:41.913
for an old college buddy
gone bad.

23:41.956 --> 23:44.782
Making Pavlenko less of
a cold, duplicitous creep,

23:44.826 --> 23:47.086
and more of a sentimental,
duplicitous creep.

23:48.956 --> 23:50.956
[dog barks in distance]

23:58.521 --> 23:59.478
[grunts]

23:59.521 --> 24:00.478
Sergei...

24:00.521 --> 24:01.739
[speaking Russian]

24:03.434 --> 24:05.086
This is America. Speak English.

24:05.130 --> 24:06.695
We are quite alone,
I assure you.

24:06.739 --> 24:08.043
Yeah? The last time
you assured me,

24:08.086 --> 24:09.478
I lost good men in
the Kola Peninsula.

24:09.521 --> 24:10.434
It was no assurance.

24:10.478 --> 24:11.913
It was a warning.

24:11.956 --> 24:13.304
To stay away
from NCIS.

24:13.347 --> 24:15.478
You chose to ignore it,
and where are you now?

24:15.521 --> 24:17.434
Setting off hand grenades
and hiding in alleys?

24:17.478 --> 24:20.913
It's not how you fall, Anton.
It's how you rise.

24:20.956 --> 24:21.913
Remember that one?

24:21.956 --> 24:24.347
Which is why I called you.

24:24.391 --> 24:25.956
To help you rise, Sergei.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.652
With a proposal from
the Russian government.

24:28.695 --> 24:30.304
The government
that wants me dead.

24:30.347 --> 24:32.391
I convinced them
to give you asylum.

24:32.434 --> 24:33.869
Complete immunity,

24:33.913 --> 24:35.521
on one condition.

24:35.565 --> 24:36.347
This should be good.

24:36.391 --> 24:39.869
Kill Gibbs.

24:39.913 --> 24:41.521
Your vendetta

24:41.565 --> 24:43.304
has dragged on long enough.

24:43.347 --> 24:45.173
We need it to end.

24:45.217 --> 24:47.347
And I have your blessing now?

24:47.391 --> 24:48.913
Why now?

24:48.956 --> 24:50.913
Why the sudden change of heart?

24:50.956 --> 24:52.347
You owe Gibbs your life.

24:52.391 --> 24:55.782
I know you believe that,
like I once did, but...

24:55.826 --> 24:56.782
That what? What?

24:56.826 --> 24:58.173
Tell me. Convince me.

24:58.217 --> 24:59.347
Nelly Benin.
The scientist.

24:59.391 --> 25:01.130
She's alive.

25:01.173 --> 25:03.347
Gibbs killing her
to save my life was a ruse.

25:03.391 --> 25:05.869
An elaborate sleight of hand

25:05.913 --> 25:07.565
to help her defect.

25:07.608 --> 25:10.826
And you know we
don't like defectors.

25:10.869 --> 25:14.478
And I don't like
being played for a fool.

25:14.521 --> 25:16.565
Is there a timetable?

25:16.608 --> 25:17.739
Now.

25:17.782 --> 25:18.782
Today.

25:18.826 --> 25:21.130
My people know
exactly where he is.

25:21.173 --> 25:24.130
I can have you there
in a matter of hours.

25:36.347 --> 25:37.608
[bird singing, duck quacking]

25:37.652 --> 25:39.347
FORNELL:
This is insane.

25:39.391 --> 25:41.869
I'm sure I saw cans of tuna
in those grocery bags.

25:41.913 --> 25:43.695
You never fished as a kid?

25:43.739 --> 25:45.347
In the summer,

25:45.391 --> 25:46.652
sure.

25:46.695 --> 25:48.130
Finger Lakes.

25:48.173 --> 25:49.565
I loved it.

25:49.608 --> 25:50.956
I should get back to it.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.391
But there's a lot I don't
do enough of anymore.

25:53.434 --> 25:55.782
Get outdoors,
work with my hands...

25:55.826 --> 25:56.782
[reel spinning]

25:56.826 --> 25:58.739
Whoa, look at this.

25:58.782 --> 26:00.086
Yeah.

26:00.130 --> 26:01.391
Reel her in. Steady.

26:01.434 --> 26:02.521
Yeah, I got it.

26:02.565 --> 26:04.565
[grunts]

26:04.608 --> 26:05.565
Beauty!

26:05.608 --> 26:07.565
[laughs]Look at that.

26:10.521 --> 26:11.956
It's big enough for two.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.347
I'm not sharing.

26:15.608 --> 26:16.565
Let's get you one.

26:20.956 --> 26:22.695
Am I reading this right?

26:22.739 --> 26:25.043
Sergei is originally
from Israel?

26:25.086 --> 26:26.173
Born in 1965.

26:26.217 --> 26:27.391
Father, Dimitri,

26:27.434 --> 26:28.913
was a Russian officer
stationed there.

26:28.956 --> 26:30.565
Nothing here about his mother.

26:30.608 --> 26:32.521
Wait a second,
I got something on her.

26:32.565 --> 26:34.565
This report says his
mother was a doctor,

26:34.608 --> 26:36.391
a Saudi national with
Palestinian roots.

26:36.434 --> 26:38.434
Apparently, the
father took Sergei

26:38.478 --> 26:40.217
back to Russia
when he was ten,

26:40.260 --> 26:42.869
leaving his
mother behind.

26:42.913 --> 26:44.826
Birth of some issues
right there.

26:47.217 --> 26:48.434
What?

26:50.086 --> 26:51.565
Am I missing something?

26:51.608 --> 26:52.782
You think that's
what's driving him?

26:52.826 --> 26:54.043
No wonder the
guy's pissed off.

26:54.086 --> 26:56.043
Uh... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:56.086 --> 26:57.565
Details. Now.

26:57.608 --> 26:59.043
Your predecessor
at that desk,

26:59.086 --> 27:00.478
Ziva David,
had a half-brother.

27:00.521 --> 27:02.217
Ari Haswari. Same father.
I know the story.

27:02.260 --> 27:04.391
Ari's mother was also a doctor
with Palestinian roots.

27:04.434 --> 27:05.608
So it's quite possible

27:05.652 --> 27:06.869
that Sergei and Ari were...

27:06.913 --> 27:07.782
Half-brothers.

27:07.826 --> 27:09.086
Which would explain the depth

27:09.130 --> 27:10.434
of his hatred for Gibbs.

27:10.478 --> 27:11.826
Should we call him?McGEE:
Well, I don't know

27:11.869 --> 27:13.173
what he'd do with that
information at the cabin,

27:13.217 --> 27:14.521
other than punch out
a grizzly bear.

27:14.565 --> 27:15.608
TONY:
It does open up a
whole new world

27:15.652 --> 27:17.478
of possible allies
for Sergei.

27:17.521 --> 27:19.304
[phone beeps]

27:19.347 --> 27:20.391
McGee.

27:20.434 --> 27:21.565
ABBY:
Okay, which one of you wants

27:21.608 --> 27:22.695
to be Gibbs Gibbs
Gibbs Gibbs Gibbs?

27:22.739 --> 27:24.478
Be right there, Abbs.

27:24.521 --> 27:28.086
I mean, it wasn't
a bad little table.

27:28.130 --> 27:31.043
I mean, Diane would always
stick a matchbook under one leg

27:31.086 --> 27:32.347
to remind me that
I'd measured wrong,

27:32.391 --> 27:33.565
but she never
got rid of it.

27:33.608 --> 27:35.391
Probably just to torture me,
I guess.

27:35.434 --> 27:36.956
She liked that you built it.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.391
Well, she was always a pushover
for that manly man stuff.

27:39.434 --> 27:41.043
God knows it worked for you.

27:41.086 --> 27:43.391
I don't know about that.

27:43.434 --> 27:46.000
You're the one
she kept remarrying, not me.

27:49.217 --> 27:51.260
Right?

27:52.304 --> 27:54.000
What the hell are we doing here?

27:55.695 --> 27:57.521
One fish is enough.

27:57.565 --> 28:00.391
Where's your team
with those updates?

28:02.695 --> 28:04.347
26 separate pieces
of grenade fragments,

28:04.391 --> 28:06.695
and there's not a single
fingerprint on any of them.

28:06.739 --> 28:07.782
Not even a partial.

28:07.826 --> 28:09.913
So what's the urgency,
Miss Sciuto?

28:09.956 --> 28:12.304
The urgency is that
this type of grenade

28:12.347 --> 28:13.521
doesn't go off
by itself.

28:13.565 --> 28:15.043
I mean, you have
to turn the handle

28:15.086 --> 28:16.347
and throw it,
and then boom.

28:16.391 --> 28:18.086
But the way this one exploded

28:18.130 --> 28:20.130
required some type of detonator.

28:20.173 --> 28:20.956
Which we never found.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.478
But you did find it.

28:22.521 --> 28:24.478
Or at least
a piece of it.

28:24.521 --> 28:25.739
It's this, right here.

28:25.782 --> 28:27.565
Looks like a blob of plastic.

28:27.608 --> 28:29.521
That's because
it's a blob of plastic.

28:29.565 --> 28:30.782
But before it melted,

28:30.826 --> 28:32.478
it was a highly sensitive,

28:32.521 --> 28:34.347
paper-thin plastic sheet

28:34.391 --> 28:36.478
that vibrates at certain
sound frequencies,

28:36.521 --> 28:38.478
triggering whatever device
it's attached to.

28:38.521 --> 28:41.000
The A/V guy.
Frankie Boulos.

28:41.043 --> 28:42.304
He said that
the grenade exploded

28:42.347 --> 28:43.739
while he was doing
a sound check.

28:43.782 --> 28:45.043
Could his voice have set it off?

28:45.086 --> 28:46.260
It would depend
on his voice.

28:46.304 --> 28:47.478
I mean,
it's more sensitive

28:47.521 --> 28:49.391
with higher-pitched
frequencies.

28:49.434 --> 28:51.391
I mean, unless
the device was

28:51.434 --> 28:53.173
super close to
the sound equipment.

28:53.217 --> 28:57.000
Or if it was planted inside
the sound equipment?

29:05.565 --> 29:06.913
Oh, yeah.

29:09.304 --> 29:11.521
Now, this is pretty great.

29:13.304 --> 29:14.521
What?

29:14.565 --> 29:17.043
Oh, yeah.
[clears throat]

29:17.086 --> 29:19.434
Come on, man.
Gotta eat.

29:19.478 --> 29:20.782
Later, maybe.

29:20.826 --> 29:22.826
Not that hungry.

29:29.043 --> 29:30.826
Are you gonna make
me ask you again?

29:34.869 --> 29:36.347
You mentioned before

29:36.391 --> 29:39.347
about Diane and me
getting remarried.

29:39.391 --> 29:41.478
In the end,
she wasn't really so sure.

29:43.434 --> 29:44.608
Natural to get
cold feet.

29:44.652 --> 29:45.608
No, it wasn't that.

29:45.652 --> 29:47.608
We were arguing one night

29:47.652 --> 29:49.347
about something stupid.

29:49.391 --> 29:50.391
I don't even remember what.

29:50.434 --> 29:54.043
And in a fit of anger,
I told her

29:54.086 --> 29:56.260
that our being together,

29:56.304 --> 29:58.826
our rekindled romance,
was a big mistake.

29:58.869 --> 30:00.217
And I stormed out.

30:00.260 --> 30:02.608
Next day,
she called.

30:02.652 --> 30:04.521
I was in a classified briefing,

30:04.565 --> 30:06.347
so she left a voice mail.

30:08.173 --> 30:09.130
That's why I hope

30:09.173 --> 30:10.782
I haven't lost my phone.

30:10.826 --> 30:13.217
It's the only way
I can still hear her voice.

30:19.434 --> 30:22.913
I was gonna give it back
to you, eventually, anyway.

30:30.739 --> 30:33.565
DIANE:
Hey, baby, it's me.

30:33.608 --> 30:37.217
Um, look, can we just
forget last night?

30:37.260 --> 30:41.173
Between Jethro's wife number two
in town and...

30:41.217 --> 30:44.000
I don't know, let's hit rewind

30:44.043 --> 30:46.130
or delete or whatever.

30:46.173 --> 30:49.956
I don't think
we're a mistake at all, Tobias,

30:50.000 --> 30:52.869
and I pray you don't, either.

30:52.913 --> 30:56.173
I know we can work through
the petty stuff.

30:56.217 --> 30:58.130
Jethro just texted me
to meet him,

30:58.173 --> 31:00.217
but call me back
as soon as you can, okay?

31:00.260 --> 31:03.347
I love you, Tobias.

31:06.043 --> 31:08.000
Call me.

31:10.086 --> 31:11.043
Every word.

31:11.086 --> 31:13.347
I agreed with
every word she said,

31:13.391 --> 31:14.956
but instead of
calling her right back,

31:15.000 --> 31:16.652
I chose to play it small.

31:16.695 --> 31:17.739
Petty.

31:17.782 --> 31:19.173
Let her twist in the wind.

31:19.217 --> 31:22.304
Serves her right.

31:22.347 --> 31:24.739
And then she was gone.

31:24.782 --> 31:27.347
Died thinking
it might be over between us.

31:29.304 --> 31:33.130
Not truly knowing
how much I loved her.

31:33.173 --> 31:34.826
No, she knew.

31:37.304 --> 31:39.086
"We're making a big mistake."

31:39.130 --> 31:41.782
Those were the last words

31:41.826 --> 31:43.130
she heard me say.

31:43.173 --> 31:47.260
And for that,
I can never forgive myself.

31:50.173 --> 31:51.260
Could you?

31:53.086 --> 31:55.608
[choked up]:
If I had a daughter, yeah.

31:57.826 --> 31:59.826
That's her daughter, Tobias.

32:02.130 --> 32:05.521
You want Diane to know
how much you love her?

32:05.565 --> 32:09.652
That's the only chance
you got left.

32:17.782 --> 32:19.043
Oh.

32:19.086 --> 32:20.956
Hey.
Hey.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.652
Is everything all right?

32:22.695 --> 32:25.478
Something's come up since
our interview this morning.

32:25.521 --> 32:27.565
We want to show you a photo.

32:27.608 --> 32:29.217
Okay.

32:29.260 --> 32:31.217
Before the bomb
went off yesterday,

32:31.260 --> 32:33.043
do you recall seeing this man?

32:33.086 --> 32:34.652
Uh, I don't know.

32:34.695 --> 32:36.956
He looks
kind of familiar.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.043
Kind of?
Mm-hmm.

32:41.130 --> 32:42.913
What is this?

32:42.956 --> 32:44.086
My son needs
his rest.

32:44.130 --> 32:46.086
How many times are you
going to disturb him?

32:46.130 --> 32:47.521
McGEE:
Mr. Boulos, I'm sorry.

32:47.565 --> 32:50.608
We... we have a few
more questions to ask.

32:54.956 --> 32:56.826
What did you tell them?

32:59.086 --> 33:01.260
Not as much as you're
about to tell us.

33:07.304 --> 33:08.695
GIBBS:
Hang on.

33:08.739 --> 33:10.086
What's that?

33:10.130 --> 33:12.347
The last part.
You're breaking up.

33:12.391 --> 33:14.086
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait. Say it again.

33:14.130 --> 33:16.869
Can you hear me?
DiNozzo!

33:16.913 --> 33:18.217
DiNozzo?

33:18.260 --> 33:19.565
What's going on?

33:19.608 --> 33:22.260
Ah... they got a suspect,

33:22.304 --> 33:24.869
but... I lost him.
I got cut off.

33:24.913 --> 33:27.217
A suspect? Not Sergei?

33:27.260 --> 33:29.608
No, somebody else,
but there's a connection.

33:29.652 --> 33:31.869
They're bringing him in for
questioning. Check your cell.

33:31.913 --> 33:33.565
Same here-- no bars.

33:33.608 --> 33:35.608
But who cares? Let's go!

33:35.652 --> 33:37.391
Go?
Yes.

33:37.434 --> 33:40.391
If Sergei is involved, you and I
should do the questioning.

33:40.434 --> 33:41.956
But it's not Sergei;
it's somebody else,

33:42.000 --> 33:43.434
and we're not
done here yet.
What?

33:43.478 --> 33:45.304
Oh, yes, we are.
I'm done.

33:45.347 --> 33:46.521
You think so?
I know so.

33:46.565 --> 33:48.086
I was just sitting here,
feeling not lousy

33:48.130 --> 33:50.217
for the first time
in I don't know when.

33:50.260 --> 33:52.304
And I appreciate it, Gibbs.

33:52.347 --> 33:54.000
Little wake-up call
to my liver.

33:54.043 --> 33:57.521
Getting to say things out loud
that I never thought I'd say.

33:57.565 --> 34:00.043
I may not be whistling rainbows
just yet, but I got the message.

34:00.086 --> 34:02.086
One night is enough.
You're right.

34:02.130 --> 34:03.695
I need to see my little girl.

34:04.739 --> 34:06.130
Not yet.

34:08.217 --> 34:10.826
What do I need here,
a safe word?

34:13.695 --> 34:15.043
What's going on?

34:15.086 --> 34:16.652
There's something
else here.

34:16.695 --> 34:18.000
What are you not telling me?

34:32.652 --> 34:34.304
Sergei is no friend.

34:34.347 --> 34:37.043
We played together
as boys in Palestine

34:37.086 --> 34:39.347
and reconnected
as young men in Kabul.

34:39.391 --> 34:41.826
Reconnected as he was making
his name in the heroin trade?

34:41.869 --> 34:43.304
Which I wanted no part of.

34:43.347 --> 34:46.391
I-I came to this country
to pursue the American dream.

34:46.434 --> 34:48.173
I've been doing just that
for years,

34:48.217 --> 34:51.260
until Sergei walked
into my shop last week.

34:51.304 --> 34:53.173
Had to be a surprise.Not a happy one.

34:53.217 --> 34:56.130
He knew we had been contracted
by the Navy

34:56.173 --> 35:00.173
and insisted I help him
deliver a package.

35:00.217 --> 35:01.217
A package?

35:02.217 --> 35:04.608
His threat to my family
was clear.

35:04.652 --> 35:06.913
I could not say no.

35:06.956 --> 35:08.391
He placed it inside a speaker

35:08.434 --> 35:10.391
and assured me
my son would be safe.

35:10.434 --> 35:11.521
How'd your son feel about it?

35:11.565 --> 35:13.347
MR. BOULOS:
I could not tell him.

35:13.391 --> 35:17.000
And my deceit
nearly cost his life.

35:17.043 --> 35:18.695
Someone else wasn't so lucky.

35:18.739 --> 35:19.782
TONY:
Okay.

35:19.826 --> 35:20.826
Where do we find him?

35:20.869 --> 35:22.347
I wish I knew.

35:22.391 --> 35:25.086
When I saw him today,
I wanted to kill him myself.

35:27.521 --> 35:28.869
He saw Sergei?

35:28.913 --> 35:30.000
You saw him today?

35:30.043 --> 35:31.130
He had the nerve to call,

35:31.173 --> 35:33.086
pretending to be
concerned for my son,

35:33.130 --> 35:34.347
then demanding a device.

35:34.391 --> 35:36.173
What kind of device?I keep only one in stock

35:36.217 --> 35:38.130
for the proper
authorities to use.

35:38.173 --> 35:41.521
It's a transmitter that blocks
cell-tower reception.

35:42.652 --> 35:44.173
BISHOP:
A cell-phone jammer.

35:44.217 --> 35:46.217
MR. BOULOS:
It's portable, long-range,[dialing]

35:46.260 --> 35:48.130
very expensive.

35:48.173 --> 35:49.391
[line ringing]

35:49.434 --> 35:51.826
And he just took it.

35:51.869 --> 35:53.869
Come on, Gibbs, pick up.

36:23.826 --> 36:25.130
Sergei.

36:26.739 --> 36:28.086
Not Gibbs...

36:28.130 --> 36:31.173
but Special Agent Fornell,
is it?

36:31.217 --> 36:33.173
We've yet to be
formally introduced.

36:33.217 --> 36:35.521
I know you...

36:35.565 --> 36:37.217
you murdering son of a bitch.

36:37.260 --> 36:39.304
Yes.

36:39.347 --> 36:41.347
My apologies.

36:42.304 --> 36:44.086
I meant only to hurt Gibbs.

36:44.130 --> 36:49.391
Never realizing how much
Miss Sterling got around.

36:51.391 --> 36:53.086
Where is he?

36:54.086 --> 36:55.652
Like I'd ever tell you.

36:56.826 --> 36:59.043
I took the mother of your child.

36:59.086 --> 37:01.086
Do you think
I'd hesitate

37:01.130 --> 37:04.043
to make that little girl
an orphan altogether?

37:11.826 --> 37:13.304
Suit yourself.

37:13.347 --> 37:16.173
[groaning]

37:34.956 --> 37:37.391
[grunting]

37:49.608 --> 37:53.043
We're back in
the Russian forest?

37:53.086 --> 37:57.130
Out to rewrite history,
Agent Gibbs?

37:57.173 --> 37:58.826
Turn back the clock?

37:58.869 --> 38:00.869
FORNELL:
If only that were possible.

38:00.913 --> 38:03.086
Where is Gibbs?

38:03.130 --> 38:06.913
This is between...
me and him, and no one else.

38:06.956 --> 38:10.478
This is between you
and me now, Sergei.

38:10.521 --> 38:12.565
Perhaps you don't know,
Agent Fornell,

38:12.608 --> 38:14.173
what Gibbs took from me.

38:14.217 --> 38:17.043
Oh, I know all about
your family tree.

38:17.086 --> 38:19.000
But I have a family, too.

38:20.869 --> 38:22.782
This is for Diane.

38:22.826 --> 38:24.782
And this?

38:24.826 --> 38:26.086
What is this?

38:26.130 --> 38:27.739
What is this?

38:27.782 --> 38:29.913
What?

38:29.956 --> 38:32.434
Well, it seems to me
that you have some options.

38:32.478 --> 38:34.391
You could drop
that sidearm,

38:34.434 --> 38:37.043
raise your arms
and surrender...

38:37.086 --> 38:38.652
Not exactly my style.

38:38.695 --> 38:40.043
No.

38:41.130 --> 38:43.956
Or you could run,
make us hunt you down.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.956
See what that feels like.

38:52.739 --> 38:54.086
[click]

39:16.391 --> 39:18.086
FORNELL:
I got him.

39:18.130 --> 39:20.130
Yeah.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.434
You feel better?

39:28.478 --> 39:30.782
Not even close.

39:32.304 --> 39:34.086
Well, maybe a little.

39:43.260 --> 39:46.608
Gibbs.

39:46.652 --> 39:49.434
I just heard
from DiNozzo and McGee.

39:49.478 --> 39:51.826
Mishnev is still dead.

39:51.869 --> 39:54.173
That supposed to be
a joke, Leon?

39:54.217 --> 39:55.434
He fooled us before.

39:55.478 --> 39:57.000
Not this time.

39:57.043 --> 39:59.173
That's for sure.

39:59.217 --> 40:00.956
Man, I really do look like hell.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.347
Did you think we were
lying to you, Tobias?

40:03.391 --> 40:05.043
Well, it's nothing
a hot shower can't fix.

40:05.086 --> 40:07.086
Amen to that, Leon.

40:07.130 --> 40:09.000
And a hot meal
with my daughter.

40:09.043 --> 40:10.869
Well, then,
our timing's perfect.

40:12.173 --> 40:14.000
And I was thinking
more of sushi?

40:21.217 --> 40:23.782
FORNELL:
Whatever you want, baby.

40:23.826 --> 40:26.086
Whatever you need, it's yours.

40:31.086 --> 40:32.826
Well, then...

40:36.043 --> 40:38.043
Good night.

40:38.086 --> 40:39.782
Good night.
Good night.

40:41.565 --> 40:44.217
And unless you need
anything else,

40:44.260 --> 40:46.043
Jake is waiting for me.

40:46.086 --> 40:48.391
We have much to discuss.

40:48.434 --> 40:50.000
Go easy on him.

40:51.043 --> 40:52.130
Good night.

40:57.086 --> 40:59.130
What, Leon?

40:59.173 --> 41:00.608
Nothing.

41:02.173 --> 41:04.217
Unless there's something
I should know.

41:05.260 --> 41:06.739
Some detail I missed

41:06.782 --> 41:09.000
you might need to tell me.

41:13.869 --> 41:15.434
Good night, Gibbs.

41:17.173 --> 41:19.173
Night.

41:32.956 --> 41:35.000
[knock at door]

41:36.173 --> 41:38.043
Yeah, it's open.
Come on in.

41:38.086 --> 41:39.217
[door opens]

41:39.260 --> 41:41.173
Open.

41:43.826 --> 41:45.000
Why am I not surprised?

41:45.043 --> 41:46.173
Hello, Anton.

41:46.217 --> 41:47.304
Don't have any vodka,

41:47.347 --> 41:48.826
but there's a cold beer
in the fridge.

41:48.869 --> 41:51.434
You are considerate...

41:51.478 --> 41:53.217
but I cannot stay.

41:53.260 --> 41:55.826
I understand
we had some success.

41:56.869 --> 41:58.782
You could say that.

42:01.304 --> 42:02.826
I admit I was nervous.

42:02.869 --> 42:04.956
He was quite
suspicious at first,

42:05.000 --> 42:06.695
but you were right.

42:06.739 --> 42:09.869
When I told him you killing
Nelly Benin was a fake,

42:09.913 --> 42:11.782
he bought it--

42:11.826 --> 42:14.478
as you say--
hook, line and sinker.

42:14.521 --> 42:15.869
People believe what

42:15.913 --> 42:17.434
they want to believe.Had he not,

42:17.478 --> 42:19.956
we might not be having
this conversation right now.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.652
But here we are.

42:22.695 --> 42:27.173

42:31.000 --> 42:32.652
Counselor.

42:34.086 --> 42:35.956
Thank you.
