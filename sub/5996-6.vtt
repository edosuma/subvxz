00:04.839 --> 00:06.340
<i>baby's daddy, Rafael,</i>

00:06.340 --> 00:08.383

00:06.340 --> 00:08.383
<i>Detective Michael.</i>

00:08.383 --> 00:12.053
<i>And guess what,</i>

00:08.383 --> 00:12.053
<i>she chose Michael.</i>

00:12.053 --> 00:14.014
<i>Until this happened.</i>

00:12.053 --> 00:14.014
You turned me in!

00:14.014 --> 00:15.891
What are you--?

00:14.014 --> 00:15.891
JANE: Michael!

00:15.891 --> 00:19.436
NARRATOR:

00:15.891 --> 00:19.436
<i>Only problem? He was wrong.</i>

00:19.436 --> 00:21.981
<i>It wasn't Rafael.</i>

00:19.436 --> 00:21.981
I am so sorry, Jane.

00:21.981 --> 00:23.858
You should go.

00:23.858 --> 00:25.150
NARRATOR:

00:23.858 --> 00:25.150
<i>Oh, and to make matters worse,</i>

00:25.150 --> 00:26.401
<i>Michael was fired.</i>

00:26.401 --> 00:29.404
<i>And then this happened.</i>

00:26.401 --> 00:29.404
Drive.

00:29.404 --> 00:31.615
NARRATOR:

00:29.404 --> 00:31.615
<i>Also under the gun, Petra.</i>

00:31.615 --> 00:33.868
<i>Remember how she stole</i>

00:31.615 --> 00:33.868
<i>Rafael's last sperm sample</i>

00:33.868 --> 00:35.202
<i>and turkey-basted herself?</i>

00:35.202 --> 00:36.662
<i>Well, her ex, Milos,</i>

00:36.662 --> 00:38.121
<i>blackmailed her</i>

00:36.662 --> 00:38.121
<i>into marrying him.</i>

00:38.121 --> 00:39.748
<i>What she didn't</i>

00:38.121 --> 00:39.748
<i>bargain for...</i>

00:39.748 --> 00:42.209
I also have 2,000

00:39.748 --> 00:42.209
live-fire hand grenades

00:42.209 --> 00:43.836
in these boxes.

00:43.836 --> 00:46.213
Wedding provided perfect cover

00:43.836 --> 00:46.213
to bring them in.

00:46.213 --> 00:50.009
NARRATOR:<i> I know! So let's go,</i>

00:46.213 --> 00:50.009
<i>because time's a-ticking.</i>

00:50.009 --> 00:53.595
<i>They say with children,</i>

00:50.009 --> 00:53.595
<i>the days feel like years.</i>

00:53.595 --> 00:54.930
You can do it, Janie.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.891
NARRATOR:

00:54.930 --> 00:56.891
<i>And the years--</i>

00:56.891 --> 00:59.518
Hurry, Mom! I can't be late

00:56.891 --> 00:59.518
for my first day of junior high.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.228
WOMAN:

00:59.518 --> 01:01.228
I'm coming.

01:01.228 --> 01:05.024
NARRATOR:

01:01.228 --> 01:05.024
<i>--well, they feel like days.</i>

01:05.024 --> 01:07.860
Dr. Garcia said

01:05.024 --> 01:07.860
he should be totally fine.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.653
She doesn't even think

01:07.860 --> 01:09.653
he'll scar.

01:09.653 --> 01:10.988
Good.

01:10.988 --> 01:13.574
Feel better?

01:10.988 --> 01:13.574
Yeah.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.450
Sort of.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.786
You don't think he'll be scarred

01:15.450 --> 01:17.786
emotionally, will he?

01:17.786 --> 01:19.538
NARRATOR:

01:17.786 --> 01:19.538
<i>She's referring, of course,</i>

01:19.538 --> 01:21.456
<i>to the events of last night.</i>

01:21.456 --> 01:25.961
( in Spanish ):

01:21.456 --> 01:25.961
Does that look like an

01:21.456 --> 01:25.961
emotionally scarred face?

01:25.961 --> 01:28.296
He's the best smiler ever.

01:28.296 --> 01:30.340
Oh, I picked up the pictures

01:28.296 --> 01:30.340
for the baby book.

01:30.340 --> 01:33.928
NARRATOR:

01:30.340 --> 01:33.928
<i>Ah, yes, the famous baby book.</i>

01:33.928 --> 01:38.057
<i>Jane's meticulous record</i>

01:33.928 --> 01:38.057
<i>of Mateo's milestones.</i>

01:38.057 --> 01:40.099
<i>And for our own record keeping,</i>

01:40.099 --> 01:42.436
<i>Jane was grappling</i>

01:40.099 --> 01:42.436
<i>with a milestone of her own.</i>

01:42.436 --> 01:44.772
(<i> mild theme playing</i> )

01:47.024 --> 01:48.984
Jane?

01:48.984 --> 01:51.612
It's gonna take time

01:48.984 --> 01:51.612
to get over him.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.614
Yeah, I know.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.366
Just gotta keep

01:54.656 --> 01:56.366
pushing forward.

01:56.366 --> 01:59.453
So, what do you think?

01:56.366 --> 01:59.453
For this afternoon?

01:59.453 --> 02:03.248
Does it say "cool, but still,

01:59.453 --> 02:03.248
like, legitimately literary"?

02:03.248 --> 02:05.834
Very cool.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.834
Very literary.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.837
NARRATOR:<i> Another milestone,</i>

02:05.834 --> 02:08.837
<i>grad school orientation.</i>

02:08.837 --> 02:10.547
Okay, but it's not

02:08.837 --> 02:10.547
too academic, right?

02:10.547 --> 02:12.549
Because I don't wanna seem

02:10.547 --> 02:12.549
like a square.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.471
NARRATOR:

02:15.510 --> 02:17.471
<i>Road trip?</i>

02:17.471 --> 02:19.681
<i>I was pretty sure</i>

02:17.471 --> 02:19.681
<i>she was gonna kill him.</i>

02:19.681 --> 02:22.017
(<i> upbeat theme playing</i> )

02:22.017 --> 02:24.061
Chip?

02:27.355 --> 02:29.984
Does this mean

02:27.355 --> 02:29.984
you'll work with me?

02:29.984 --> 02:31.986
I still haven't decided.

02:31.986 --> 02:33.654
Don't know if I trust you.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.906
NARRATOR:<i> Sorry. Can we check</i>

02:33.654 --> 02:35.906
<i>something real quick?</i>

02:35.906 --> 02:39.451
<i>Okay, here's where we left off.</i>

02:35.906 --> 02:39.451
Drive.

02:39.451 --> 02:43.330
NARRATOR:<i> I'm sorry, my bad.</i>

02:39.451 --> 02:43.330
<i>It seems there was more.</i>

02:43.330 --> 02:44.832
Why'd you call me?

02:44.832 --> 02:48.877
Because Sin Rostro

02:44.832 --> 02:48.877
cost me everything,

02:48.877 --> 02:50.712
and I can't rest

02:48.877 --> 02:50.712
knowing she's out there.

02:50.712 --> 02:53.048
You worked for her because

02:50.712 --> 02:53.048
she threatened your family.

02:53.048 --> 02:55.258
If that's true,

02:53.048 --> 02:55.258
help me catch her.

02:55.258 --> 02:58.512
You don't have to trust me.

02:55.258 --> 02:58.512
You just have to work with me.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.347
What do you say?

03:00.347 --> 03:03.391
Yes. Michael got into my head.

03:03.391 --> 03:06.269
And I believed him and not you,

03:03.391 --> 03:06.269
and I'm really sorry.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.313
( knocks on door )

03:08.313 --> 03:10.482
Mr. Aguilar is here.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.482
Uh, thank you. Send him in.

03:10.482 --> 03:13.777
You ready?

03:10.482 --> 03:13.777
Yes.

03:13.777 --> 03:16.905
Just real quick. What exactly

03:13.777 --> 03:16.905
does estate planning entail?

03:16.905 --> 03:18.239
Estate planning entails

03:18.239 --> 03:19.992
thinking and preparing

03:18.239 --> 03:19.992
for Mateo's future.

03:19.992 --> 03:22.911
We aim to eliminate

03:19.992 --> 03:22.911
all uncertainty.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.579
Well, now you're

03:22.911 --> 03:24.579
speaking my language.

03:24.579 --> 03:26.832
She does like

03:24.579 --> 03:26.832
to be prepared.

03:26.832 --> 03:29.208
(<i> mild theme playing</i> )

03:31.086 --> 03:34.882
Okay, the basics: Custody.

03:31.086 --> 03:34.882
Jane, you're dead.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.009
You want Rafael

03:34.882 --> 03:37.009
to raise Mateo, right?

03:37.009 --> 03:38.760
Oh, yes.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.471
Let's say you're in a really bad

03:38.760 --> 03:41.471
car accident, on life support.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.264
Still Rafael?

03:41.471 --> 03:43.264
Yeah.

03:43.264 --> 03:45.851
Gotcha. And do you wanna stay

03:43.264 --> 03:45.851
on life support,

03:45.851 --> 03:48.353
or do you wanna be taken off

03:45.851 --> 03:48.353
if you're a total vegetable?

03:48.353 --> 03:51.857
I mean, I guess taken off.

03:48.353 --> 03:51.857
But not too soon.

03:51.857 --> 03:53.817
Standard's about a month.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.819
Okay, let's say you're both

03:53.817 --> 03:55.819
killed in a car accident.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.696
NARRATOR:

03:55.819 --> 03:57.696
<i>Wow. This guy's grim.</i>

03:57.696 --> 04:00.991
Then who gets him?

03:57.696 --> 04:00.991
My mom, right?

04:00.991 --> 04:03.326
And would Mom be in charge

04:00.991 --> 04:03.326
of Mateo's trust fund?

04:03.326 --> 04:06.121
Hmm?

04:03.326 --> 04:06.121
Trust fund. It's sizable.

04:06.121 --> 04:09.290
And in the event of Rafael's

04:06.121 --> 04:09.290
death, he would come into about,

04:09.290 --> 04:10.542
what is it now, 40?

04:10.542 --> 04:12.460
Yeah, that's about right.

04:12.460 --> 04:13.795
Forty...?

04:13.795 --> 04:15.380
Million, give or take.

about too much money?

You knew he was rich.

Yeah, not that rich.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.310

05:20.779 --> 05:22.239
And action!

05:40.632 --> 05:43.468
Ro and Luciana hate each other

WOMAN:

05:47.264 --> 05:48.765
I just hope

they're done by 2.

MILOS:

05:48.765 --> 05:50.309
<i>I said, 1.9.</i>

05:50.309 --> 05:53.352
These are only worth 1.7.

06:04.323 --> 06:08.827
Now, Milos is asking for 1.9,

06:04.323 --> 06:08.827
you're willing to pay 1.7.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.120
So perhaps

06:08.827 --> 06:10.120
a middle ground?

06:10.120 --> 06:11.705
( chuckles )

06:15.834 --> 06:18.170
Fine, 1.8.

06:18.170 --> 06:19.587

06:19.587 --> 06:21.131
And I sleep with your wife.

06:21.131 --> 06:24.092
Milos, stop! The bombs!

Deal is off.

Kiss the pavement!

He would have

06:26.136 --> 06:28.347
taken the bombs!

06:28.347 --> 06:30.682
We do not negotiate

Eight months.

I can't wait eight months.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.438
Mateo had a nice

little growth spurt.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.940

17:08.778 --> 17:10.822
What's going on?

17:10.822 --> 17:13.032
Mateo's got

17:10.822 --> 17:13.032
a fairly pronounced case

17:13.032 --> 17:14.784
of what we call plagiocephaly.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.452
And it sounds

17:14.784 --> 17:16.452
worse than it is.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.621
Basically, it means

17:16.452 --> 17:18.621
he's got a flat head.

17:18.621 --> 17:20.456
A flat head?

17:18.621 --> 17:20.456
Why?

17:20.456 --> 17:22.625
Well, he's probably spending

17:20.456 --> 17:22.625
a little too much time

17:22.625 --> 17:24.168
laying flat on his back.

17:24.168 --> 17:26.045
Because babies need to sleep

17:24.168 --> 17:26.045
on their backs,

17:26.045 --> 17:28.715
we really need to be vigilant

Look, it's largely

cosmetic.

17:41.895 --> 17:44.438
But Mateo's condition

17:41.895 --> 17:44.438
is pronounced,

17:44.438 --> 17:46.440
so there could be

17:44.438 --> 17:46.440
some visual disturbances,

17:46.440 --> 17:47.859

17:47.859 --> 17:51.612
Which is why some

A helmet?

17:51.612 --> 17:54.407

It has to be

custom-fitted

17:56.034 --> 17:58.160
so Mateo would wear it

21:23.783 --> 21:26.285
Therefore, Jane took pity on me,

21:23.783 --> 21:26.285
helped get you out.

21:26.285 --> 21:29.205
Therefore, you can help me

21:26.285 --> 21:29.205
get rid of the grenades.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.751
What is that? Is that--?

21:33.751 --> 21:35.628
Is that a tear?

21:35.628 --> 21:39.506
Ugh. Just to scare peoples off.

21:39.506 --> 21:43.970
Really?

21:39.506 --> 21:43.970
Yes. Really.

21:43.970 --> 21:47.723
Come. Mommy help you

21:43.970 --> 21:47.723
get rid of Milos.

21:47.723 --> 21:50.059
And therapist.

21:50.059 --> 21:53.437
So I told him, like,

21:50.059 --> 21:53.437
I will get rid of you.

21:53.437 --> 21:54.688
Mm-mm.

21:54.688 --> 21:57.024
Hey.

21:54.688 --> 21:57.024
Hey, what's happening?

21:57.024 --> 21:59.318
How are you?

21:57.024 --> 21:59.318
Good.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.862
It's nice to be out here,

21:59.318 --> 22:01.862
away from everything.

22:01.862 --> 22:04.740
But I'm sorry, go on,

22:01.862 --> 22:04.740
you were talking.

22:04.740 --> 22:07.160
Oh. Sorry, it's, uh, weird.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.495
I was talking pretty personally

22:07.160 --> 22:09.495
about my ex-boyfriend

22:09.495 --> 22:11.914
and we just, like,

22:09.495 --> 22:11.914
don't really know each other.

22:11.914 --> 22:13.540
Wesley.

22:11.914 --> 22:13.540
You are being so rude.

22:13.540 --> 22:14.792
What? It's true.

22:14.792 --> 22:16.460
We're telling personal

22:14.792 --> 22:16.460
stories in class

22:16.460 --> 22:17.795
and there's no reciprocity.

22:17.795 --> 22:19.672
Seriously, just stop.

22:17.795 --> 22:19.672
I feel overexposed.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.215
We know nothing personal

22:19.672 --> 22:21.215
about her.

22:21.215 --> 22:23.342
Okay, fine.

22:21.215 --> 22:23.342
Do you wanna know something?

22:23.342 --> 22:25.928
My son just got a medical helmet

22:23.342 --> 22:25.928
and I couldn't be there.

22:25.928 --> 22:27.387
A helmet? Why?

22:27.387 --> 22:28.848
Because he has

22:27.387 --> 22:28.848
a flat head

22:28.848 --> 22:30.724
from spending too much

22:28.848 --> 22:30.724
time on his back.

22:30.724 --> 22:33.351
While I've been writing,

22:30.724 --> 22:33.351
badly, apparently.

22:33.351 --> 22:37.315
So I'm failing at being

22:33.351 --> 22:37.315
a writer and a mom.

22:37.315 --> 22:38.941
Well, I feel better.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.943
Finally, some reciprocity.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.943
Ah.

22:40.943 --> 22:43.487
So, what's the rest of

22:40.943 --> 22:43.487
your story, Jane Gloriana?

22:43.487 --> 22:46.657
Oh, uh, well, for one thing,

22:43.487 --> 22:46.657
that's not my real name.

22:46.657 --> 22:49.160
NARRATOR:<i> And so Jane told</i>

22:53.206 --> 22:56.334

22:56.334 --> 22:58.919
<i>Mateo's kidnapping.</i>

22:58.919 --> 23:02.340
That's it in a nutshell, ah.

22:58.919 --> 23:02.340
Wow.

23:03.341 --> 23:05.467
Well, nice to meet you.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.636
(<i> mild theme playing</i> )

23:10.639 --> 23:13.226
NARRATOR:<i> And maybe it was</i>

23:10.639 --> 23:13.226
<i>the fact that she'd opened up,</i>

23:13.226 --> 23:17.313
<i>but that night, Jane's writing</i>

23:13.226 --> 23:17.313

23:30.368 --> 23:32.161

<i>Okay, this isn't good.</i>

23:39.417 --> 23:43.047
<i>Boobs really bursting.</i>

23:43.047 --> 23:45.383
( in Spanish ):

23:43.047 --> 23:45.383
Excuse me, Mr. Don Juan.

23:45.383 --> 23:49.262
The men from corporate

23:45.383 --> 23:49.262
headquarters are here.

23:49.262 --> 23:50.596
( in Spanish ):

23:49.262 --> 23:50.596
Let them in.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.265
We'll make love later.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.521
( in English ):

23:57.853 --> 23:59.521
Cut!

23:59.521 --> 24:01.565
We'll go tighter,

23:59.521 --> 24:01.565
just on my eyes.

24:01.565 --> 24:04.151
Rogelio.

24:01.565 --> 24:04.151
Hello,

24:04.151 --> 24:07.947
my favorite network big shot.

24:04.151 --> 24:07.947
Great to see you.

24:07.947 --> 24:11.284
Can we talk?

24:07.947 --> 24:11.284
As producer, director or star?

24:14.536 --> 24:15.955
Producer.

24:18.291 --> 24:20.709
Okay, as producer.

24:18.291 --> 24:20.709
The director is great.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.420
( laughs )

24:22.420 --> 24:25.005
But we still have a lot of shots

24:22.420 --> 24:25.005
left to make our day, so...

24:25.005 --> 24:26.715
Oh, I'll be quick.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.592
You're out of money

24:26.715 --> 24:28.592
and way behind schedule.

24:28.592 --> 24:30.677
We're pulling the plug.

24:30.677 --> 24:31.971
What?

24:31.971 --> 24:35.433
The plug.

24:31.971 --> 24:35.433
Thank you.

24:35.433 --> 24:38.436
So are you ready to see

24:35.433 --> 24:38.436
the cutest little man ever?

24:38.436 --> 24:39.853
Oh!

24:39.853 --> 24:42.940
Oh, my God. Ever. Oh!

24:42.940 --> 24:45.067
He should be up any minute

24:42.940 --> 24:45.067
and be ready to eat.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.777
Okay, I'll wait

24:45.067 --> 24:46.777
to pump then.

24:50.656 --> 24:53.784
So, ah, did your lawyer

24:50.656 --> 24:53.784
call back again?

24:53.784 --> 24:54.910
Yes.

24:54.910 --> 24:57.413
Does he wanna kill me?

24:54.910 --> 24:57.413
No.

24:57.413 --> 24:59.039
NARRATOR:

24:57.413 --> 24:59.039
<i>A direct quote from his lawyer:</i>

24:59.039 --> 25:01.625
<i>"I want to kill her."</i>

25:01.625 --> 25:04.502
I'm just still thinking through

25:01.625 --> 25:04.502
all the different scenarios.

25:04.502 --> 25:06.755
We can give him money

25:04.502 --> 25:06.755
under certain conditions--

25:06.755 --> 25:08.341
I know,

25:06.755 --> 25:08.341
but here's the thing.

25:08.341 --> 25:10.217
No matter how we slice it,

25:10.217 --> 25:11.969
Mateo's rich.

25:11.969 --> 25:14.347
I know.

25:14.347 --> 25:17.350
It's just so weird.

25:14.347 --> 25:17.350
( chuckles )

25:17.350 --> 25:18.767
I'm raising a rich kid

25:18.767 --> 25:20.769
and that's just not the way

25:18.767 --> 25:20.769
I grew up.

25:20.769 --> 25:23.230
You know, and you said your

25:20.769 --> 25:23.230
childhood was all screwed up.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.898
Yeah, but not

25:23.230 --> 25:24.898
because I had money.

25:24.898 --> 25:27.567
I was screwed up

25:24.898 --> 25:27.567
because of my family.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.611
And that's why...

25:29.611 --> 25:31.947
(<i> tender theme playing</i> )

25:31.947 --> 25:35.242
I've been fighting

25:31.947 --> 25:35.242
so hard for ours.

25:39.246 --> 25:42.082
I don't want

25:39.246 --> 25:42.082
to complicate things.

25:42.082 --> 25:44.335
It would actually

25:42.082 --> 25:44.335
uncomplicate things.

25:44.335 --> 25:47.046
It wouldn't.

25:44.335 --> 25:47.046
Why?

25:48.339 --> 25:50.966
Because I'm not

25:48.339 --> 25:50.966
over him yet.

25:56.347 --> 25:58.765
I'm sorry. I know

25:56.347 --> 25:58.765
that's not what you wanna hear.

26:02.186 --> 26:05.022
No, ah. No, it's, um...

26:05.022 --> 26:06.315
It's good that I know.

26:06.315 --> 26:07.525
( baby crying )

26:07.525 --> 26:08.901
I'm gonna feed him.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.152
He won't latch.

26:10.152 --> 26:11.611
Sweetie, what's wrong?

26:11.611 --> 26:13.489
It's probably the helmet.

26:11.611 --> 26:13.489
He just feels weird.

26:13.489 --> 26:14.740
Just keep trying.

26:14.740 --> 26:15.991
Maybe he's not hungry.

26:15.991 --> 26:17.826
No, this is

26:15.991 --> 26:17.826
his hungry scream.

26:17.826 --> 26:20.787
Just get me the bottle!

26:17.826 --> 26:20.787
Okay. Here, here.

26:24.333 --> 26:27.086
(<i> mild theme playing</i> )

26:27.086 --> 26:29.171
Oh, my God.

26:29.171 --> 26:31.507
He's weaned off me.

26:34.634 --> 26:36.887
JANE:

26:34.634 --> 26:36.887
Where's Mateo? Huh!

26:36.887 --> 26:39.932
There he is. Ah!

26:39.932 --> 26:41.850
And...

26:41.850 --> 26:43.643
JILL:

26:41.850 --> 26:43.643
So is he still not nursing?

26:43.643 --> 26:45.479
No, ah.

26:43.643 --> 26:45.479
It's just me and the pump.

26:45.479 --> 26:47.314
Up every three hours.

26:45.479 --> 26:47.314
Ah.

26:47.314 --> 26:49.483
Well, it's nice

26:47.314 --> 26:49.483
to have you back in class.

26:49.483 --> 26:51.902
Not that we mind having

26:49.483 --> 26:51.902
the occasional daddy.

26:51.902 --> 26:54.447
I know, Rafael's way better

26:51.902 --> 26:54.447
at the hand choreography.

26:55.822 --> 27:00.369
So you guys are definitely

26:55.822 --> 27:00.369
not together, right?

27:00.369 --> 27:02.955
Um, no. Why?

27:02.955 --> 27:04.831
This is awkward.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.831
What is?

27:04.831 --> 27:08.877
Sometimes it feels like

27:04.831 --> 27:08.877
there's kind of a...

27:08.877 --> 27:12.548
vibe between me and Rafael.

27:12.548 --> 27:14.007
Oh!

27:14.007 --> 27:15.301
Is it weird that, like,

27:15.301 --> 27:16.634
I'm even bringing it up?

27:16.634 --> 27:18.095
No, it's not.

27:18.095 --> 27:20.013
Are you sure?

27:20.013 --> 27:21.681
Yes.

27:20.013 --> 27:21.681
( both laugh )

27:21.681 --> 27:23.641
Yeah. I mean,

27:21.681 --> 27:23.641
I only hesitated

27:23.641 --> 27:25.685
because I think it's weird

27:23.641 --> 27:25.685
that you even think

27:25.685 --> 27:27.980
that it was weird, because

27:25.685 --> 27:27.980
it's not at all. It's...

27:27.980 --> 27:29.689
( laughing ):

27:27.980 --> 27:29.689
Yeah.

27:29.689 --> 27:31.108
Of course it's weird.

27:31.108 --> 27:33.693
They have a vibe.

27:31.108 --> 27:33.693
What does that even mean?

27:33.693 --> 27:36.405
That they get along well

27:33.693 --> 27:36.405
and there's chemistry.

27:36.405 --> 27:37.948
Hilarious.

27:36.405 --> 27:37.948
Agreed.

27:39.575 --> 27:40.951
I can't be weird about it,

27:40.951 --> 27:42.202
I have to rise above it.

27:42.202 --> 27:44.079
You're human and he's hot.

27:44.079 --> 27:45.289
But let me ask you this:

27:45.289 --> 27:46.873
If you were with Michael,

27:46.873 --> 27:49.418
would you care who your

27:46.873 --> 27:49.418
baby daddy was dating?

27:49.418 --> 27:50.919
No, I wouldn't.

27:50.919 --> 27:53.297
So? You're doing

27:50.919 --> 27:53.297
the right thing

27:53.297 --> 27:54.840
by keeping it platonic

27:53.297 --> 27:54.840
with Rafael.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.467
I mean, after everything

27:54.840 --> 27:56.467
you've told me

27:56.467 --> 27:57.717
about his insane family.

27:57.717 --> 27:58.969
I know,

27:58.969 --> 28:00.387

But I have secured

28:21.283 --> 28:23.118
a private investor,

28:23.118 --> 28:27.665

28:31.669 --> 28:34.129
Sorry to be leaving you,

28:31.669 --> 28:34.129
my pregnant<i> princezna,</i>

28:34.129 --> 28:36.632
but it's better I find

28:34.129 --> 28:36.632
a buyer from Prague

28:36.632 --> 28:38.133
so I don't kill your mother.

28:38.133 --> 28:39.843
She's driving me insane.

28:39.843 --> 28:41.595
NARRATOR:<i> Oh, cool.</i>

28:39.843 --> 28:41.595
<i>Their plan is working.</i>

28:41.595 --> 28:43.805
That's because you eat

28:41.595 --> 28:43.805
like animal

28:43.805 --> 28:46.392
and you don't pick up

28:43.805 --> 28:46.392
your socks.

28:46.392 --> 28:47.560
( exhales )

28:47.560 --> 28:48.852
NARRATOR:

28:47.560 --> 28:48.852
<i>As soon as he is gone,</i>

28:48.852 --> 28:50.145
<i>they'll ditch the grenades.</i>

28:50.145 --> 28:51.355
( knocks on door )

28:51.355 --> 28:54.816
Ah, good. Ivan.

28:51.355 --> 28:54.816
Huh?

28:54.816 --> 28:58.654
NARRATOR:<i> The man they</i>

28:54.816 --> 28:58.654
<i>accidentally took hostage?</i>

28:58.654 --> 29:01.990
Hello again, ladies.

28:58.654 --> 29:01.990
What's he doing here?

29:01.990 --> 29:04.076
He's staying with you,

29:01.990 --> 29:04.076
sweetheart,

29:04.076 --> 29:06.537
to make sure you

29:04.076 --> 29:06.537
and your cow of a mother

29:06.537 --> 29:08.664
don't get rid of my bombs.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.418
NARRATOR:

29:10.999 --> 29:12.418
<i>And speaking of cows,</i>

29:12.418 --> 29:13.835
( phone ringing )

29:13.835 --> 29:15.546
<i>the past month there's</i>

29:13.835 --> 29:15.546
<i>been a lot of this.</i>

29:15.546 --> 29:16.796
Hey.

29:15.546 --> 29:16.796
Pumping?

29:16.796 --> 29:18.257
Always.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.008
How'd he go down?

29:18.257 --> 29:20.008
<i>Oh, easy.</i>

29:20.008 --> 29:22.094
I rocked him for ten minutes

29:20.008 --> 29:22.094
and he was out.

29:24.888 --> 29:27.725
So you know Charlie's mom?

29:27.725 --> 29:30.644
<i>From music class?</i>

29:27.725 --> 29:30.644
<i>She kind of--</i>

29:30.644 --> 29:32.688
I don't know,

29:30.644 --> 29:32.688
she kind of asked me out.

29:32.688 --> 29:35.274
Yeah, she actually

29:32.688 --> 29:35.274
asked me first.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.859
If it was weird.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.859
Oh!

29:37.859 --> 29:40.820
And is it?

29:42.406 --> 29:43.949
Of course not.

29:45.367 --> 29:48.704
Okay. That's great.

29:50.205 --> 29:52.791
Anyway, I'm done,

29:50.205 --> 29:52.791
so I should head to bed.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.628
I gotta be up in two hours

29:52.791 --> 29:55.628
and 40 minutes.

29:55.628 --> 29:58.505
Okay, all right. Good night.

29:55.628 --> 29:58.505
<i>Bye.</i>

30:00.758 --> 30:02.801
( sighs )

30:05.887 --> 30:08.432
Jane?

30:08.432 --> 30:11.435
Jane!

30:11.435 --> 30:12.936
To fall asleep

30:11.435 --> 30:12.936
while someone's

30:12.936 --> 30:15.105
reading their work.

30:12.936 --> 30:15.105
I know, I feel terribly

30:15.105 --> 30:16.523
and I promise

30:15.105 --> 30:16.523
it won't happen again.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.858
There are a lot of people

30:16.523 --> 30:18.858
that wanna be here

30:18.858 --> 30:21.487
and, ah, you need to prove

30:18.858 --> 30:21.487
you're one of them.

30:21.487 --> 30:22.862
JANE:

30:21.487 --> 30:22.862
Mm-hmm.

30:22.862 --> 30:25.073
Until then,

30:25.073 --> 30:27.409
you're on academic probation.

30:27.409 --> 30:30.329
NARRATOR:<i> And she thought</i>

30:27.409 --> 30:30.329
<i>a C-minus was bad.</i>

30:32.247 --> 30:34.874
( whirring )

30:34.874 --> 30:37.586
NARRATOR:

30:34.874 --> 30:37.586
<i>Oops. My mistake.</i>

30:37.586 --> 30:40.088
<i>I'm exhausted</i>

30:37.586 --> 30:40.088
<i>just looking at her.</i>

30:40.088 --> 30:42.633
Jane, as you can imagine,

30:40.088 --> 30:42.633
has been burning the candle

30:42.633 --> 30:44.176
at both ends.

30:55.979 --> 30:57.856
( crying )

30:57.856 --> 31:00.192
Oh, honey, I know, I know.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.027
It's okay, Mr. Sweetface.

31:02.027 --> 31:05.405
I got you.

31:02.027 --> 31:05.405
Come on. Okay, come.

31:05.405 --> 31:06.990
Let's find your lovey.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.784
Ow. Mommy's booby.

31:08.784 --> 31:11.870
( in Spanish ):

31:08.784 --> 31:11.870
<i>Mi amor,</i> you don't look

31:08.784 --> 31:11.870
so good.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.079
Have you seen his lovey?

31:13.079 --> 31:14.540
NARRATOR:

31:13.079 --> 31:14.540
<i>Which brings us here,</i>

31:14.540 --> 31:16.542
<i>to Jane just plain burning up.</i>

31:16.542 --> 31:18.335
I think you've got a fever.

31:18.335 --> 31:20.128
I'm fine.

31:18.335 --> 31:20.128
His lovey,<i> Abuela!</i>

31:20.128 --> 31:23.089
His lovey? Um...

31:30.806 --> 31:32.015
It's here.

31:32.015 --> 31:33.475
RAFAEL:

31:32.015 --> 31:33.475
So you're pretty sick, huh?

31:33.475 --> 31:34.810
Apparently.

31:36.102 --> 31:37.479
What are you holding

31:36.102 --> 31:37.479
on your boob?

31:37.479 --> 31:38.731
A hot diaper

31:38.731 --> 31:40.273
because I have a clogged duct.

31:40.273 --> 31:41.608
And mastitis, apparently,

31:41.608 --> 31:43.109
which means

31:41.608 --> 31:43.109
that my boob has the flu

31:43.109 --> 31:45.362
and it feels like glass shards

31:43.109 --> 31:45.362
are shooting out

31:45.362 --> 31:46.822
when I pump.

31:46.822 --> 31:49.449
Got you.

31:46.822 --> 31:49.449
Maybe you should stop.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.702
What?

31:49.449 --> 31:51.702
Pumping.

31:51.702 --> 31:53.203
I plan to nurse for a year.

31:53.203 --> 31:54.996
Nurse. Not pump.

31:54.996 --> 31:57.207
And you gotta be able

31:54.996 --> 31:57.207
to change your plan, right?

31:57.207 --> 31:59.125
I mean, if it's not working.

31:59.125 --> 32:02.128
Just shut up and go away.

32:02.128 --> 32:03.463
What?

32:03.463 --> 32:07.509
I'm serious.

32:03.463 --> 32:07.509
Shut up and go away.

32:07.509 --> 32:08.802
She okay?

32:08.802 --> 32:11.722
Yeah.

32:08.802 --> 32:11.722
She was just a little--

32:11.722 --> 32:14.224
Bitchy. I know. She's the worst

32:11.722 --> 32:14.224
when she's sick.

32:14.224 --> 32:15.434
Wait, what?

32:15.434 --> 32:16.769
( in Spanish ):

32:15.434 --> 32:16.769
Always has been.

32:16.769 --> 32:18.437
JANE:

32:16.769 --> 32:18.437
I can hear you

32:18.437 --> 32:20.146
and I hate all of you!

32:20.146 --> 32:23.358
I hate to say this,

32:20.146 --> 32:23.358
but I have to leave.

32:23.358 --> 32:25.944
What? Why?

32:25.944 --> 32:29.364
Milos was arrested for

32:25.944 --> 32:29.364
Internet scamming in Prague.

32:29.364 --> 32:31.283
NARRATOR:

32:29.364 --> 32:31.283
<i>Which Petra knew, of course,</i>

32:31.283 --> 32:33.952
<i>since she and her mom</i>

32:31.283 --> 32:33.952
<i>had been copying his files</i>

32:33.952 --> 32:36.622
<i>and sending them to the Czech</i>

32:33.952 --> 32:36.622
<i>authorities for the past month.</i>

32:36.622 --> 32:40.667
I have to go,

32:36.622 --> 32:40.667
see who I can bribe.

32:40.667 --> 32:41.919
Yes!

32:41.919 --> 32:43.962
Hey.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.505
What are you doing

32:43.962 --> 32:45.505
back here?

32:45.505 --> 32:47.507
Jill was tired

32:45.505 --> 32:47.507
after the charity gala.

32:47.507 --> 32:49.635
I wanted to make sure

32:47.507 --> 32:49.635
you were feeling better.

32:49.635 --> 32:51.094
I am.

32:51.094 --> 32:54.473
And, look,

32:51.094 --> 32:54.473
I'm sorry about before.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.266
I've heard of

32:54.473 --> 32:56.266
mean drunks, but...

32:56.266 --> 32:57.726
I know, it's weird.

32:57.726 --> 33:00.562
It's, like, a fever thing,

32:57.726 --> 33:00.562
I think.

33:02.230 --> 33:03.941
But what you said,

33:03.941 --> 33:06.318
don't you think it's selfish

33:03.941 --> 33:06.318
to stop pumping?

33:06.318 --> 33:08.612
I mean, what if Mateo's IQ

33:06.318 --> 33:08.612
is a point lower

33:08.612 --> 33:10.196
or he gets more colds?

33:10.196 --> 33:11.865
Look, with everything

33:10.196 --> 33:11.865
happening,

33:11.865 --> 33:14.075
with you in school full-time

33:11.865 --> 33:14.075
and not sleeping...

33:14.075 --> 33:16.119
Think I should stop?

33:14.075 --> 33:16.119
With all the benefits?

33:16.119 --> 33:20.081
Mateo is eating solids now

33:16.119 --> 33:20.081
and he's doing great.

33:20.081 --> 33:23.251
And I just would like to see

33:20.081 --> 33:23.251
you start feeling great too.

33:23.251 --> 33:24.878
(<i> soft theme playing</i> )

33:24.878 --> 33:26.212
Okay.

33:30.717 --> 33:33.052
Oh, my God.

33:30.717 --> 33:33.052
I'm so relieved!

33:33.052 --> 33:35.013
I mean, it'll take

33:33.052 --> 33:35.013
a month to wean,

33:35.013 --> 33:36.974
but the end is in sight.

33:38.433 --> 33:41.019
Finally, so glad to be rid

33:38.433 --> 33:41.019
of these things.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.938
Someone could have

33:41.019 --> 33:42.938
been killed.

33:42.938 --> 33:45.941
MAGDA: Oops, one more.

33:42.938 --> 33:45.941
PETRA: Oh, my God.

33:45.941 --> 33:48.234
I think the babies

33:45.941 --> 33:48.234
are kicking.

33:48.234 --> 33:50.111
Wait. Where is the pin?

33:50.111 --> 33:51.947
( explosion )

33:50.111 --> 33:51.947
( screams )

34:00.873 --> 34:03.917
Mother, please reconsider.

34:15.012 --> 34:16.889
Let's do something

34:15.012 --> 34:16.889
for Thanksgiving.

34:16.889 --> 34:19.265
What I have to be

34:16.889 --> 34:19.265
grateful for?

34:19.265 --> 34:20.684
My hook?

34:24.062 --> 34:26.481
Petra? Oh. You okay?

34:26.481 --> 34:27.983
Yeah.

34:26.481 --> 34:27.983
JANE: How's your mother?

34:27.983 --> 34:29.275
PETRA:

34:27.983 --> 34:29.275
Slightly better.

34:29.275 --> 34:31.570
( Mateo fusses )

34:29.275 --> 34:31.570
What?

34:31.570 --> 34:33.238
I know.

34:33.238 --> 34:36.909
I know what you want.

34:33.238 --> 34:36.909
Yeah.

34:36.909 --> 34:41.997
Who taught you to do

34:36.909 --> 34:41.997
all the, uh, baby stuff?

34:41.997 --> 34:45.375
My mom's not exactly

34:41.997 --> 34:45.375
nurturing.

34:45.375 --> 34:46.877
Ah.

34:46.877 --> 34:49.963
Forget it.

34:46.877 --> 34:49.963
You were a natural, I'm sure.

34:49.963 --> 34:51.548
Oh, my God, no.

34:51.548 --> 34:53.759
( laughing ):

34:51.548 --> 34:53.759
Not at all.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.719
Oh, I felt like

34:53.759 --> 34:55.719
I knew nothing.

34:55.719 --> 34:57.262
I still do, actually.

34:58.889 --> 35:01.099
But it's like he's been

34:58.889 --> 35:01.099
with me the whole time.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.517
It's weird.

35:02.517 --> 35:04.352
I don't feel prepared.

35:04.352 --> 35:07.022
Yeah, well,

35:04.352 --> 35:07.022
you never really are.

35:07.022 --> 35:08.732
You know,

35:07.022 --> 35:08.732
it's a hard balance.

35:08.732 --> 35:12.069
It's kind of like

35:08.732 --> 35:12.069
you learn on the job.

35:12.069 --> 35:14.320
And just when you think

35:12.069 --> 35:14.320
you've figured it out,

35:14.320 --> 35:15.655
something changes.

35:15.655 --> 35:17.407
Then you have

35:15.655 --> 35:17.407
to do everything different.

35:19.993 --> 35:21.661
You'll be okay.

35:25.457 --> 35:27.960
So I hear

35:25.457 --> 35:27.960
you two finally have a plan.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.586
A two-part plan, in fact.

35:29.586 --> 35:32.881
Part one: to review the plan

35:29.586 --> 35:32.881
every three years,

35:32.881 --> 35:34.299
because we plan to reevaluate

35:34.299 --> 35:36.009
and re-adjust the plan

35:34.299 --> 35:36.009
as need be.

35:36.009 --> 35:38.219
Gotcha. And does

35:36.009 --> 35:38.219
part two have something

35:38.219 --> 35:39.471
I could write down?

35:39.471 --> 35:40.931
Yes, we've decided to attach

35:40.931 --> 35:42.724
Mateo's trust fund

35:40.931 --> 35:42.724
to a charity.

35:42.724 --> 35:46.269
So for every dollar he gets,

35:42.724 --> 35:46.269
he has to give a dollar away.

35:46.269 --> 35:48.647
I'd like to thank my parents,

35:46.269 --> 35:48.647
of course,

35:48.647 --> 35:52.233
for instilling in me

35:48.647 --> 35:52.233
the desire to give back.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.693
Thank you to my mentors,

35:53.693 --> 35:56.154
Michelle Obama

35:53.693 --> 35:56.154
and Angelina Jolie,

35:56.154 --> 35:59.908
whose fight to make sure

35:56.154 --> 35:59.908
all girls receive an education

35:59.908 --> 36:02.702
led me to the Peace Corps

35:59.908 --> 36:02.702
and Let Girls Learn.

36:02.702 --> 36:07.373
I'm here at the U.N. because

36:02.702 --> 36:07.373
more than 62 million girls

36:07.373 --> 36:11.044
do not have access

36:07.373 --> 36:11.044
to an education. Huh?

36:11.044 --> 36:13.212
I'm sorry,

36:11.044 --> 36:13.212
I have to go pee-pee.

36:13.212 --> 36:15.090
NARRATOR:<i> And speaking of</i>

36:13.212 --> 36:15.090
<i>a huge relief...</i>

36:15.090 --> 36:18.468
Well, did the<i> Telemasivo</i> execs

36:15.090 --> 36:18.468
like<i> Hombres Locos?</i>

36:18.468 --> 36:21.638
They... loved it.

36:21.638 --> 36:23.222
NARRATOR:

36:21.638 --> 36:23.222
<i>Wow. That's a shock.</i>

36:23.222 --> 36:24.474
First of all,

36:24.474 --> 36:26.852
they thought it was hilarious.

36:26.852 --> 36:30.480
I was like, "It's not a comedy,

36:26.852 --> 36:30.480
no, but okay."

36:30.480 --> 36:34.067
Then they say

36:30.480 --> 36:34.067
I was like a young, uh...

36:34.067 --> 36:36.903
Oh, "Desi Arnaz."

36:36.903 --> 36:38.655
Remind me to Google

36:36.903 --> 36:38.655
that guy.

36:39.656 --> 36:41.867
( sighs )

36:41.867 --> 36:43.201
Phew!

36:45.162 --> 36:48.247
XIOMARA: You okay?

36:45.162 --> 36:48.247
Just relieved.

36:48.247 --> 36:49.791
<i>The Passions of Santos</i>

36:49.791 --> 36:51.918
was the most popular

36:49.791 --> 36:51.918
telenovela on Earth.

36:51.918 --> 36:54.587
To follow that up,

36:51.918 --> 36:54.587
scrutiny will be intense.

36:54.587 --> 36:57.674
Oh, I didn't realize

36:54.587 --> 36:57.674
you were feeling such pressure.

36:57.674 --> 36:59.217
I hide my nerves

36:57.674 --> 36:59.217
incredibly well.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.136
It is one of my most

36:59.217 --> 37:01.136
underrated talents.

37:01.136 --> 37:03.346
( knock on door )

37:01.136 --> 37:03.346
( door opens )

37:05.264 --> 37:06.808
JANE:

37:05.264 --> 37:06.808
Helmet's off.

37:06.808 --> 37:08.768
( Alba speaking Spanish )

37:06.808 --> 37:08.768
( laughs )

37:08.768 --> 37:10.937
ROGELIO: Yay, no helmet.

37:08.768 --> 37:10.937
XIOMARA: Yay!

37:10.937 --> 37:13.773
NARRATOR:<i> Which brings us</i>

37:10.937 --> 37:13.773

37:18.737 --> 37:20.864
(<i> tender theme playing</i> )

37:24.325 --> 37:27.204
<i>Oh. And also...</i>

37:33.376 --> 37:35.087
<i>And finally...</i>

37:39.382 --> 37:41.218
Well, this year is easy.

37:41.218 --> 37:42.719
I'm thankful for Mateo.

37:42.719 --> 37:45.430
All day, every day.

37:45.430 --> 37:48.850
( in Spanish ):

37:45.430 --> 37:48.850
I'm thankful for God's grace.

37:48.850 --> 37:51.686
Health and hair.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.855
Always health and hair.

37:53.855 --> 37:57.150
And I'm thankful I got to see

37:53.855 --> 37:57.150
how hard you work, Rogelio.

37:57.150 --> 38:00.403
It's inspired me

37:57.150 --> 38:00.403
to get after it,

38:00.403 --> 38:03.531
my singing career, this year.

38:00.403 --> 38:03.531
Go, Mom!

38:04.991 --> 38:06.910
Rafael?

38:08.536 --> 38:09.955
This.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.707
Grateful for all of it.

38:12.707 --> 38:13.875
( doorbell rings )

38:13.875 --> 38:15.752
JANE:

38:13.875 --> 38:15.752
That must be Petra.

38:15.752 --> 38:18.255
I left Mateo's lovey

38:15.752 --> 38:18.255
at Rafael's office,

38:18.255 --> 38:19.380
and she said she'd bring it.

38:19.380 --> 38:20.966
NARRATOR:

38:19.380 --> 38:20.966
<i>It should be noted,</i>

38:20.966 --> 38:23.969
<i>after the great lovey debacle</i>

38:20.966 --> 38:23.969
<i>of last month,</i>

38:23.969 --> 38:26.596
<i>there were now three backup</i>

38:23.969 --> 38:26.596
<i>loveys in this very house.</i>

38:26.596 --> 38:29.015
Ah, I have the lovey.

38:29.015 --> 38:30.516
Thank you so much.

38:30.516 --> 38:32.644
He wouldn't have been

38:30.516 --> 38:32.644
able to sleep.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.395
You know what, come in,

38:34.395 --> 38:36.148
since you're here

38:34.395 --> 38:36.148
and there's so much food.

38:36.148 --> 38:37.732
Oh, no, no. I'm fine.

38:37.732 --> 38:40.068
Really. I'd like it.

38:40.068 --> 38:42.904
Come in.

38:40.068 --> 38:42.904
Yeah, okay.

38:44.114 --> 38:46.032
Thank you.

38:44.114 --> 38:46.032
NARRATOR:<i> And thus,</i>

38:46.032 --> 38:47.993
<i>Petra, too, was grateful.</i>

38:47.993 --> 38:51.288
<i>And briefly, all was right.</i>

38:53.248 --> 38:54.499
Thank you.

38:54.499 --> 38:55.959
( phone ringing )

38:55.959 --> 38:57.460
It's my lawyer,

38:57.460 --> 39:00.297
probably calling

38:57.460 --> 39:00.297
to rave about the show.

39:00.297 --> 39:02.632
Mm-hmm. Uh-huh, uh-huh.

39:02.632 --> 39:05.677
And who exactly

39:02.632 --> 39:05.677
is this Matthew Weiner?

39:09.555 --> 39:11.474
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

39:11.474 --> 39:13.768
And what does a "cease

39:11.474 --> 39:13.768
and desist" mean anyway?

39:13.768 --> 39:16.062
Stop, no more dishes.

39:16.062 --> 39:18.397
We'll finish tomorrow.

39:18.397 --> 39:19.899
So can I ask you a question?

39:19.899 --> 39:21.109
That's rhetorical, right?

39:21.109 --> 39:22.527
Because you're gonna ask

39:21.109 --> 39:22.527
anyway.

39:24.070 --> 39:26.031
What happened

39:24.070 --> 39:26.031
between you and Jill?

39:26.031 --> 39:28.325
I bumped into her this morning

39:26.031 --> 39:28.325
at the supermarket

39:28.325 --> 39:30.493
and she acted all weird.

39:30.493 --> 39:32.787
I told you, we fizzled out.

39:32.787 --> 39:35.498
It was more

39:32.787 --> 39:35.498
than fizzled-out weird.

39:35.498 --> 39:39.211
Okay. Do you remember

39:35.498 --> 39:39.211
the night I realized

39:39.211 --> 39:41.171
you're actually

39:39.211 --> 39:41.171
a very mean person.

39:41.171 --> 39:42.339
Oh, my God, seriously?

39:42.339 --> 39:43.923
Anyway, as cranky

39:42.339 --> 39:43.923
and stinky

39:43.923 --> 39:45.091
and mean as you were--

39:45.091 --> 39:46.592
I hope this story

39:45.091 --> 39:46.592
has a point.

39:46.592 --> 39:48.053
--I realized

39:46.592 --> 39:48.053
that I would still

39:48.053 --> 39:50.263
rather be with you.

39:50.263 --> 39:52.640
At your worst.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.267
So Jill just wasn't

39:52.640 --> 39:54.267
the person.

39:54.267 --> 39:55.894
NARRATOR:

39:54.267 --> 39:55.894
<i>And in that moment,</i>

39:55.894 --> 39:58.313

39:55.894 --> 39:58.313
<i>a window opening for him.</i>

39:58.313 --> 40:00.982
Oh. It's getting hot

39:58.313 --> 40:00.982
in here, huh?

40:03.776 --> 40:05.362
Go on a date with me.

40:06.363 --> 40:08.406
Just one. Say yes.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.158
NARRATOR:

40:08.406 --> 40:10.158
<i>And maybe it was the turkey,</i>

40:10.158 --> 40:12.451
<i>or the first glass of wine</i>

40:10.158 --> 40:12.451
<i>post-pumping,</i>

40:12.451 --> 40:16.373
<i>or just the fact that enough</i>

40:12.451 --> 40:16.373

40:16.373 --> 40:17.916
( camera shutter clicking )

40:19.918 --> 40:23.421
<i>But Jane said...</i>

40:19.918 --> 40:23.421
Yes.

40:29.135 --> 40:30.511
MICHAEL:

40:29.135 --> 40:30.511
Detective Barnett.

40:31.804 --> 40:35.433
Michael.

40:31.804 --> 40:35.433
We need to talk.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.143
No, don't be sorry,

40:37.143 --> 40:38.978
I'm just sad you can't

40:37.143 --> 40:38.978
make it for dessert.

40:38.978 --> 40:42.190
I know, I'm just stuck

40:38.978 --> 40:42.190
at my mom's. Bye, Jane.

40:43.524 --> 40:46.319
Sorry, where were we?

40:43.524 --> 40:46.319
Now, are you sure

40:46.319 --> 40:47.904
no one's gonna find out

40:46.319 --> 40:47.904
we spoke?

40:47.904 --> 40:50.282
No way. Anonymous sources.

40:50.282 --> 40:52.784
Come on. For a thousand bucks,

40:50.282 --> 40:52.784
you better have good stuff.

40:52.784 --> 40:55.787
Trust me, I got plenty

40:52.784 --> 40:55.787
of dirt on the Solanos.

40:59.540 --> 41:02.043
After everything you've told me

40:59.540 --> 41:02.043
about his insane family...

41:02.043 --> 41:04.379
I know. It's like

41:02.043 --> 41:04.379
the curse of the Solanos.

41:04.379 --> 41:06.672
NARRATOR:<i> That's not fair.</i>

41:04.379 --> 41:06.672
<i>The Solanos aren't cursed.</i>

41:06.672 --> 41:07.966
<i>In fact, there's Petra</i>

41:07.966 --> 41:09.467
<i>and she's on a bit of</i>

Magda, looking good.

41:17.267 --> 41:20.478
Here's the thing, Milos

41:17.267 --> 41:20.478
knows you two set him up.

41:25.191 --> 41:27.944
He will forgive Petra,

41:25.191 --> 41:27.944
his wife, I suppose.

41:27.944 --> 41:29.737
But will Petra forgive you

41:29.737 --> 41:32.157
when she finds out

41:29.737 --> 41:32.157
what else you're hiding?

41:36.202 --> 41:38.288
( screams )

41:41.040 --> 41:42.792
It was accident?

NARRATOR:

41:43.876 --> 41:45.837
<i>Yeah.</i>

41:45.837 --> 41:49.590
