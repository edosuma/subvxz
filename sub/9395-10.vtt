03:06.212 --> 03:07.246
Well you look like hell.

03:09.018 --> 03:10.134
I didn’t get much sleep.

03:10.564 --> 03:11.619
Why’s that? What’s up?

03:12.910 --> 03:15.136
You ever have a tough decision to make,

03:15.618 --> 03:17.046
and you wonder if you made the right choice?

03:17.440 --> 03:18.796
Well, what kind of choice are you talking about?

03:19.805 --> 03:20.442
Well…

03:24.526 --> 03:25.423
Morning Boyfriend…

03:28.696 --> 03:29.570
again.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.121
Thank You.

03:34.187 --> 03:35.268
I think you’re good.

03:37.701 --> 03:40.117
Keith, Brooke. Brooke, my uncle Keith.

03:40.690 --> 03:41.340
Hi.

03:42.057 --> 03:42.708
Hi.

03:44.127 --> 03:45.309
We gotta get out of here, alright.

03:45.411 --> 03:49.191
Yeah okay. Oh don’t forget your moms calling from Italy 6 pm sharp.

03:49.251 --> 03:50.971
Oh right, alright I’ll be here, promise.

03:51.467 --> 03:52.133
Okay.

03:59.158 --> 04:01.120
So if my parents come home,

04:02.103 --> 04:05.605
I’m gonna act like I have amnesia, so don’t freak out if I pretend not to know you.

04:10.551 --> 04:13.771
Look, I think I should get back to the madness.

04:14.973 --> 04:19.473
But hey, if I could, I’d stay like this all day.

04:21.666 --> 04:22.424
Okay.

04:27.794 --> 04:30.478
Nathan, about last night…

04:30.990 --> 04:34.748
Hey, look, its not about sex with me, okay?

04:36.083 --> 04:38.690
When you’re ready, I’ll be too.

04:41.658 --> 04:42.578
Come here.

05:08.617 --> 05:10.669
Special Delivery for Mrs. Dan Scott.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.563
What are you doing here?

05:14.080 --> 05:15.861
I wanted to apologize for last night.

05:16.558 --> 05:19.518
We were both spent. We both said things we regret.

05:19.839 --> 05:20.710
At least I know I did.

05:21.094 --> 05:22.512
- Dan…
- These are for you.

05:24.146 --> 05:27.935
And, I made a reservation at Chatley Resort.

05:29.563 --> 05:30.603
Remember the view?

05:31.924 --> 05:37.249
Dan… if you’re in the mood to mend fences, start by devoting a weekend to your son.

05:37.805 --> 05:41.047
One without your inflated expectations of him.

05:41.457 --> 05:45.523
If you hadn’t noticed the only quality time you’ve spent with him lately was in an emergency room.

05:46.644 --> 05:51.001
You figure out how to make sure that never happens again then maybe you and I can talk.

05:57.473 --> 06:00.847
It’s not that hard, alright? Peyton and I just don’t make sense as a couple.

06:01.373 --> 06:02.404
She said so herself.

06:02.515 --> 06:03.759
And then took it back.

06:04.974 --> 06:06.249
Now what are you? Her lawyer?

06:07.232 --> 06:11.420
I’m just… look, I’ve seen Peyton really try to make an effort to turn things around

06:11.461 --> 06:14.804
and it just sucks that she got bit the first time she reached out to somebody, you know?

06:15.342 --> 06:17.779
Haley, I’m not the bad guy here, okay?

06:18.177 --> 06:20.278
Peyton’s just too… hard.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.843
Unlike Brooke who I understand is nice and easy.

06:23.104 --> 06:23.852
Excuse me.

06:24.849 --> 06:28.627
She makes me laugh. She’s honest, she’s not afraid to be herself. Okay?

06:28.695 --> 06:30.349
Plus she’s not covered head to toe in issues.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.318
What’s so bad about that?

06:35.222 --> 06:38.156
Nothing! Nothing. If you’re happy, I’m happy.

06:38.582 --> 06:39.165
Are you?

06:40.823 --> 06:41.618
Happy.

06:44.332 --> 06:44.956
Yeah.

06:46.896 --> 06:47.956
I hope you’re right.

06:54.377 --> 06:58.325
Hey, I’ve been two-waying you all day, where have you been?

06:59.337 --> 07:00.254
Nowhere really.

07:02.082 --> 07:03.700
I wanted to talk to you about Lucas.

07:05.453 --> 07:06.997
You left so quick the other night.

07:08.256 --> 07:09.337
What was that all about?

07:10.300 --> 07:11.498
Did he tell you what happened?

07:12.466 --> 07:15.410
We didn’t really do much talking after you left, if you know what I mean.

07:17.048 --> 07:19.158
I was just returning a CD I borrowed.

07:26.321 --> 07:27.238
Late night?

07:27.876 --> 07:28.497
Yeah.

07:29.485 --> 07:30.212
Who’s the girl?

07:31.127 --> 07:32.020
You don’t know her.

07:33.012 --> 07:35.387
Come on, man. We’re gonna be late for practice.

07:44.861 --> 07:46.412
Nice to see you vertical.

07:48.766 --> 07:49.705
How you feeling?

07:50.226 --> 07:51.245
Same as always.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.026
What’s this all about?

07:56.407 --> 08:02.483
Seems to me, we’ve lost track of what this game’s supposed to be about.

08:03.652 --> 08:04.957
Myself included.

08:06.180 --> 08:08.081
I want you to take this time,

08:09.032 --> 08:11.316
and think about why we’re really out there.

08:12.489 --> 08:15.836
Till then, no practice.

08:26.041 --> 08:26.834
This sucks.

08:26.948 --> 08:30.531
Speak for yourself. Whitey just did me a favor.

08:31.427 --> 08:34.275
Yeah, me too.

08:45.213 --> 08:45.864
Peyton.

08:47.006 --> 08:47.658
What?

08:48.898 --> 08:52.205
Look, about last night, I feel really bad about what happened…

08:52.241 --> 08:53.781
Can we not relive it, please?

08:54.591 --> 08:57.985
I’d had this really weird, long day, and I just…

08:58.748 --> 09:01.144
- I probably wasn’t making any sense.
- No, you were.

09:01.722 --> 09:05.645
But I had no idea you were coming over last night, you know. And Brooke and I were just…

09:05.715 --> 09:06.700
Make a really good couple.

09:08.037 --> 09:09.295
I’m happy for you.

09:10.749 --> 09:14.088
You’re a good guy, Luke. And she’s my best friend.

09:17.344 --> 09:21.629
Business seems to have dropped off lately, and I’m beginning to take it personally.

09:21.711 --> 09:24.979
Oh don’t, no, it’s the University, they’re on a break. It will pick up soon.

09:25.540 --> 09:26.175
Oh.

09:27.512 --> 09:33.381
You know, Karen actually always thought we should do live entertainment to bring people in, like um…

09:33.632 --> 09:35.239
like an open mic night.

09:35.510 --> 09:38.511
Hmm, well that’s a great idea.

09:38.633 --> 09:40.051
- You think?
- Yeah absolutely.

09:40.216 --> 09:44.674
But let me run it by Lucas first, you know, make sure he’s ok with the idea.

09:44.792 --> 09:49.539
Yeah or, I could talk to him. I mean, he hasn’t popped in much lately.

09:49.723 --> 09:53.948
Yeah yeah, I’ve noticed. No that’s one of the reasons I want to talk to him myself.

09:54.162 --> 09:55.143
Okay.

09:55.775 --> 09:59.948
Well, if you have this ghost town under control, then I have a study session with Nathan.

10:00.649 --> 10:03.798
Haley, I’m glad you’re seeing Nathan.

10:04.264 --> 10:05.958
He’s lucky to have someone like you.

10:07.193 --> 10:07.873
Thanks.

10:09.641 --> 10:10.204
Bye!

10:26.683 --> 10:28.093
What are you doing?

10:28.324 --> 10:29.270
Documenting.

10:30.059 --> 10:32.583
A day without Cheer. Hour one.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.228
There’s something wrong with this picture though.

10:36.975 --> 10:38.783
Oh I know what it is, I’m not in it!

10:40.142 --> 10:40.924
Come here.

10:47.284 --> 10:49.540
Would you please draw your freaky drawings later?

10:50.283 --> 10:53.525
There is no basketball, we’re young, we’re gorgeous,

10:53.760 --> 10:56.612
we have all this free time so lets go do something fun.

10:57.144 --> 11:00.082
What about Lucas? I’m sure he’d be up for some fun.

11:00.779 --> 11:02.146
Probably some polaroids too.

11:03.704 --> 11:06.975
Lucas, the monkey in the room.

11:07.830 --> 11:08.567
Elephant.

11:09.298 --> 11:10.204
Whatever.

11:11.208 --> 11:13.784
Look, I came to make sure there’s no weirdness about that.

11:14.695 --> 11:18.755
You’re my best friend and I would never cut you out for a guy. Okay?

11:18.822 --> 11:22.729
No matter who he is. Or how happy he makes me.

11:23.780 --> 11:26.037
Brooke, I’m cool with you and Lucas.

11:26.575 --> 11:27.249
You sure?

11:27.579 --> 11:31.331
Yeah, I just wanna draw for a little bit.

11:33.583 --> 11:34.606
How about a rain check?

11:38.012 --> 11:38.800
Count on it.

11:39.984 --> 11:40.941
Hoes over bros.

11:43.936 --> 11:45.349
I am gonna borrow this though.

11:45.958 --> 11:48.396
Incase he’s feeling frisky. Thanks!

11:59.690 --> 12:01.048
Tell me I heard this wrong

12:02.445 --> 12:04.136
It’s called knocking.

12:04.222 --> 12:05.845
You did not just cancel practice.

12:05.907 --> 12:07.693
You ever play the ponies, Danny?

12:08.226 --> 12:12.199
What do you think of a Whirly Bird in the third? You think that’s a win place or show?

12:12.353 --> 12:15.287
Have you completely lost it? You have a perfect season.

12:17.002 --> 12:21.788
You see that sign in the gym? It’s got my name on it.

12:22.368 --> 12:24.333
Means I call the shots.

12:25.203 --> 12:27.662
The game’s not fun anymore, Danny.

12:28.512 --> 12:31.569
Somewhere along the way we’ve strayed off the path.

12:31.860 --> 12:34.538
You’re supposed to be their coach, a leader.

12:36.648 --> 12:38.955
That is something that we agree on.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.541
We’ve driven him too hard, Danny.

12:41.686 --> 12:42.823
What are you talking about?

12:43.231 --> 12:44.409
Dehydration.

12:46.288 --> 12:48.090
We both know it’s more than that.

12:48.465 --> 12:49.565
So now you’re a doctor.

12:50.063 --> 12:52.509
I’ve taken steps to ease the pressure.

12:54.516 --> 12:58.248
I think you’d be well advised to take a couple of days and do the same.

13:04.830 --> 13:06.928
Hit the lights on the way out, would you?

13:20.505 --> 13:21.828
Hey. How you feeling son?

13:22.543 --> 13:25.226
Okay. What’s my bag doing here?

13:25.324 --> 13:26.460
Well I packed some things for you.

13:26.988 --> 13:31.273
- Dad, I’m not gonna move to the beach house.
- You’re not gonna have to, we’ll work this out.

13:32.236 --> 13:35.144
- Well then what’s this?
- You and I are going away for the weekend.

13:35.989 --> 13:37.883
- Are you kidding?
- I already cleared it with your mom.

13:37.919 --> 13:40.659
I’ve got your golf clubs in the back of the car, we’ve got a 9 am tee-time.

13:40.700 --> 13:44.544
Dad, you can’t just spring things on me like this, alright? I had plans this weekend.

13:44.601 --> 13:46.736
I know you do, with me.

13:58.804 --> 14:04.082
Oh, say it isn’t so. Fergy and Skills take it 15-13.

14:09.770 --> 14:12.034
This guy's got his own personal cheering squad now?

14:12.199 --> 14:13.753
How you know she's not cheering for me?

14:14.031 --> 14:16.442
Trust me dawg, she's not cheering for you man.

14:16.981 --> 14:17.455
Hey babe.

14:17.609 --> 14:20.170
Hey Luke. So that means we’re gonna get to see a little bit more of you,

14:20.201 --> 14:22.489
I mean you know since you got some time on your hands, right?

14:22.545 --> 14:24.619
Not if I have anything to say about it, boys.

14:24.906 --> 14:26.503
See that is whack, dawg.

14:27.297 --> 14:29.269
We win the game and he get the girl.

14:38.766 --> 14:39.493
Lucas?

14:40.885 --> 14:41.858
Oh hey...

14:42.157 --> 14:46.462
I’m not playing hookie from your moms café, I just ran out of coffee filters.

14:47.419 --> 14:50.562
Okay. See you later.

14:51.198 --> 14:54.668
I’m glad we bumped into each other. Haley and I were talking

14:54.726 --> 14:58.759
and we thought it might be fun to start up some live entertainment at the café.

14:58.872 --> 14:59.400
Great.

15:00.117 --> 15:04.336
Are you sure? Because if you think it’s a decision your mom should be making I understand.

15:04.398 --> 15:08.340
No it’s… it’s a great idea. It’s good. Good.

15:08.489 --> 15:09.406
- Good.
- Yeah.

15:11.065 --> 15:14.695
- Lucas, are you alright?
- Yeah.

15:15.001 --> 15:20.341
Hey. Don’t you think it makes more sense to buy in bulk? Plus… for desert.

15:23.906 --> 15:26.711
Oh, Hi Mrs. Scott.

15:27.018 --> 15:27.618
Hi.

15:28.871 --> 15:32.466
Um… excuse me.

15:37.918 --> 15:40.863
Of all the things to stick in my mouth it had to be my foot.

15:42.270 --> 15:43.679
Lucas, come on, hold up.

15:44.836 --> 15:46.280
Did you see the look on her face?

15:46.986 --> 15:51.748
Yeah, total Judge Judy. Which is completely ridiculous considering who her son is.

15:52.982 --> 15:54.420
She’s friends with my mom.

15:56.212 --> 15:58.623
Right… forgot about that one.

15:59.769 --> 16:04.143
Well, your mom’s in Europe for the next month so what are the odds she remembers this?

16:04.922 --> 16:06.577
Whipped cream and condoms…

16:14.087 --> 16:15.532
Are you and mom getting a divorce?

16:16.401 --> 16:17.553
Why? What’d she tell you?

16:18.014 --> 16:21.828
She kicked you out of the house, right? That’s usually the first step.

16:22.612 --> 16:24.838
Don’t worry, things will be back to normal in no time.

16:25.054 --> 16:28.905
No, dad. Mom doesn’t want things to be back to normal, she wants them to be better.

16:29.627 --> 16:32.001
Listen to me Nathan, you have a great life.

16:32.191 --> 16:35.017
A beautiful home and a basketball pedigree any kid would die for.

16:35.633 --> 16:36.635
Yeah, I know.

16:37.577 --> 16:38.408
I almost did.

16:40.394 --> 16:41.474
Hey, what are you doing?

16:41.730 --> 16:45.790
Oh just marveling at my lack of artistic ability. How’s the amazing race?

16:46.143 --> 16:48.417
Well, it’s about as well as can be expected.

16:48.678 --> 16:51.852
Well, I wish you were here. We’re doing this open mic thing at the café tomorrow.

16:52.041 --> 16:55.344
So I’m gone for 2 hours and you go all Hollywood on me.

16:55.442 --> 16:58.360
Yeah that’s me, Glamour girl. Hey, you want to say hi to your mom?

17:00.008 --> 17:02.441
No, it’s bad timing.

17:03.106 --> 17:05.861
Look, let me give you a call back alright? Bye.

17:08.415 --> 17:09.240
How’s he doing?

17:09.470 --> 17:13.326
Well there was no gun play or screaming so I’m assuming pretty well. He said to say “hi”.

17:14.203 --> 17:19.296
- Haley, these um, these flyers…
- Suck! Yeah, uh huh! I know! I know!

17:19.576 --> 17:23.673
I’m trying everything! Hang on!

17:26.329 --> 17:27.180
Hi Keith, bye Keith.

17:28.061 --> 17:29.095
Nice talking to you too.

17:29.607 --> 17:31.210
Hey, Oh I’m glad you’re here.

17:31.563 --> 17:33.279
Yeah I heard you could use the business.

17:34.180 --> 17:35.978
Uh, yeah, that too.

17:37.303 --> 17:40.533
So let me guess, Dan did something.

17:40.647 --> 17:44.952
Of course, but actually this is about Lucas.

17:45.638 --> 17:50.021
I saw him at the grocery store today. He was with a girl.

17:50.116 --> 17:53.145
Oh yeah, that’s Brooke, he’s been spending a lot of time with her.

17:53.646 --> 17:54.951
I can’t say I blame him.

17:55.244 --> 17:57.692
Uh, they were, buying condoms.

17:58.669 --> 17:59.472
Right.

18:01.634 --> 18:05.602
I guess you could take comfort in the fact that he’s being safe,

18:05.648 --> 18:10.972
but you know mistakes happen. I’m a walking poster child for it.

18:11.791 --> 18:12.533
Oh boy.

18:13.973 --> 18:16.225
Karen’s calling tonight, what am I going to tell her?

18:17.347 --> 18:20.025
You know besides the fact that I want what’s best for Lucas, I just...

18:20.705 --> 18:22.144
I don’t wanna let her down.

18:22.851 --> 18:28.386
Well then don’t. She’s 3000 miles away, she trust’s you to handle this.

18:28.739 --> 18:30.234
I could always lock him in the cellar.

18:31.002 --> 18:33.030
I was going to suggest talking to him.

18:33.481 --> 18:34.198
Or that!

18:40.005 --> 18:40.853
Oh, hey.

18:41.539 --> 18:41.959
Hey.

18:42.179 --> 18:44.258
I need your help. Don’t worry, it doesn’t involve orphans

18:44.299 --> 18:46.689
or Nathan or any major commitment of any kind.

18:47.087 --> 18:48.190
What does it involve?

18:48.358 --> 18:49.366
Your artistic ability.

18:51.551 --> 18:52.152
Cute.

18:52.266 --> 18:54.478
I know. Can you fix it?

18:54.824 --> 18:56.791
Yeah! I can burn them!

18:57.348 --> 18:59.260
Can you come up with a design that doesn’t suck?

18:59.397 --> 19:01.291
- When do you need them by?
- Tomorrow afternoon.

19:01.968 --> 19:02.685
Okay.

19:02.864 --> 19:04.237
Oh, thank you! You’re the best.

19:04.537 --> 19:06.602
I take back everything I said about you before we met.

19:10.242 --> 19:11.430
Welcome back, Mr. Scott.

19:11.676 --> 19:14.333
- Thank you.
- Your room is all ready. And your wife?

19:14.476 --> 19:16.258
Uh, actually there’s been a change of plans.

19:16.310 --> 19:18.505
This is gonna be a guys weekend! This is my son Nathan.

19:18.582 --> 19:21.199
Oh well the suite that you requested has a King size.

19:21.260 --> 19:22.432
Shall I check for a double room?

19:22.575 --> 19:23.831
I’d hate to give up the view.

19:24.815 --> 19:27.023
I’ll tell you what. Why don’t you bring up a cot.

19:27.130 --> 19:27.957
Very good.

19:29.084 --> 19:30.656
Dad, are you kidding me?

19:31.183 --> 19:32.975
This was supposed to be a weekend for you and mom?

19:33.502 --> 19:35.197
Well, it didn’t work out that way did it?

19:35.283 --> 19:37.515
So this whole father son thing, this is just plan B.

19:37.582 --> 19:40.424
What difference does it make how or why we got here. The point is we’re here.

19:40.486 --> 19:41.714
And we’re gonna have a good time.

19:46.635 --> 19:47.340
It’s Haley.

19:47.961 --> 19:49.359
She’s got you on a short leash.

19:51.376 --> 19:52.144
Yeah.

19:52.380 --> 19:53.460
Hey, it's Haley.

19:53.670 --> 19:56.532
Yeah, I know. Look, its not a good time right now, alright?

19:56.619 --> 19:58.338
- Oh sorry, I just…
- I’ll call you back.

19:59.236 --> 20:00.045
Nice work.

20:01.993 --> 20:04.083
Shall I send up your bags?

20:04.315 --> 20:08.292
I have some golf clubs in the back of the car too, I’m taking my son to school on the links tomorrow.

20:08.344 --> 20:09.814
They’ll be waiting on you on the tee in the morning.

20:09.891 --> 20:10.540
Perfect.

20:28.615 --> 20:29.833
Hi, Uncle Keith.

20:30.489 --> 20:31.139
Brooke.

20:32.322 --> 20:35.358
Could you maybe pick this up some other time? I’d like to have a word with Luke.

20:36.279 --> 20:37.047
Okay.

20:38.154 --> 20:40.242
- Keith.
- Say goodnight, Luke

20:41.358 --> 20:44.180
I’ll… call you later.

20:53.175 --> 20:54.655
What the hell do you think you’re doing?

20:54.793 --> 20:56.754
That’s funny, I was just about to ask you the same thing.

20:57.569 --> 20:58.296
I get it.

20:59.375 --> 21:00.743
This is about Deb, right?

21:00.875 --> 21:05.434
No. This is, um, about you. And some incredibly bad judgment.

21:05.960 --> 21:09.508
And I think you should remember that Deb’s the one keeping your mothers business alive while she’s gone.

21:09.855 --> 21:13.430
Yes, but it doesn’t give her the right to butt in, alright?

21:13.927 --> 21:17.752
I mean, look at Nathan. The guy gets away with 10 times the crap I do.

21:17.819 --> 21:18.852
Well, you’re not Nathan.

21:20.456 --> 21:23.004
And you know, that’s not the point.

21:23.998 --> 21:26.896
I mean, what is this? You couldn’t even be home for your mothers phone call tonight?

21:30.188 --> 21:31.101
I forgot.

21:32.943 --> 21:33.907
What’d you tell her?

21:34.582 --> 21:37.013
I told her that you missed her. And that you loved her.

21:37.668 --> 21:39.322
And that you were at the library studying.

21:40.564 --> 21:47.038
You know, the Luke Scott that I know, is better than this.

21:48.114 --> 21:50.351
Well look, the Keith Scott that I know isn’t my mother, alright?

21:51.398 --> 21:54.164
He’s not even her boyfriend. So this really isn’t your business.

21:54.755 --> 21:56.050
Well, that’s where you’re wrong.

21:56.664 --> 21:58.303
Cause while I’m here, it is my business.

21:59.725 --> 22:02.542
You know, you might wanna take a long hard look in the mirror.

22:02.798 --> 22:06.223
And see if the guy staring back at you is the kind of person you want to be.

22:24.644 --> 22:27.631
Well, what do you know, you actually hit the fare way this time.

22:35.755 --> 22:36.805
Watch and learn.

22:43.103 --> 22:44.469
Oh, so pretty!

22:45.009 --> 22:48.842
My ball cleared yours on the fly. Maybe you wanna hit from the ladies tee next time.

22:49.082 --> 22:49.799
Wanna drive?

22:50.584 --> 22:51.417
I just did!

22:53.855 --> 22:59.021
Vex, Cat Power, Cheap Trick. You’re all over the place!

22:59.319 --> 23:00.864
I kind of got a lot of moods.

23:03.003 --> 23:08.293
- Alright, finished.
- Oh, this is great! Thank you!

23:08.365 --> 23:09.154
No problem.

23:09.773 --> 23:12.528
Hello! Best friend! Pick up the phone.

23:13.075 --> 23:16.675
Don’t pretend you’re not there, cause I can see you on your cry for help web cam.

23:17.365 --> 23:18.608
Web Cam?

23:19.179 --> 23:20.551
Hi to you too tutor girl!

23:20.623 --> 23:23.429
Hold no just one second. Hello?

23:25.248 --> 23:28.021
Look, I’m busy, I promised I would do something.

23:29.121 --> 23:32.122
Okay. Yeah I’ll call you tonight. Bye.

23:33.638 --> 23:35.271
Do you need help with those?

23:35.568 --> 23:36.935
Oh no, you don’t have to do that.

23:36.996 --> 23:39.843
No, yeah I do. I mean, if you want help.

23:40.320 --> 23:42.435
Yes, I would love help. Yeah, come on.

23:47.468 --> 23:47.980
Hey.

23:48.872 --> 23:49.567
Hey.

23:49.828 --> 23:52.556
I was just on my way down to the river court man, thought maybe you’d want to shoot around.

23:52.699 --> 23:54.994
Yeah, it kind of feels weird not having Saturday practice, right?

23:56.663 --> 23:57.912
Never thought I’d miss it.

23:58.261 --> 24:02.157
Yeah, I appreciate it, but I kind of have to stay around the house today.

24:02.530 --> 24:03.554
What, are you grounded?

24:04.112 --> 24:05.771
No, no not exactly.

24:07.016 --> 24:07.783
You sick?

24:12.662 --> 24:16.980
Alright cool, you know what? You don’t wanna hang out with me, man, its cool. Alright?

24:17.800 --> 24:18.680
I’ll see you later, man.

24:19.261 --> 24:19.985
Luke.

24:23.780 --> 24:24.469
Come on in.

24:42.328 --> 24:43.737
So, this is Jenny.

24:47.889 --> 24:48.656
Is she...

24:48.784 --> 24:52.112
Yeah. Yeah, she’s all mine.

24:52.742 --> 24:54.155
Wow, that is unbelievable.

24:55.497 --> 24:56.419
How old is she?

24:56.808 --> 25:00.321
She’s 6 months. 9 days and a couple of hours.

25:05.773 --> 25:06.787
Who’s the mother?

25:07.423 --> 25:09.736
Uh, that’s...

25:11.800 --> 25:14.944
that's a long story but lets just say shes out of the picture.

25:18.296 --> 25:19.659
So you’re raising her all by yourself?

25:20.324 --> 25:22.075
No, my parents they work nights.

25:22.470 --> 25:24.948
And they help out a lot, between the three of us we’re handling it.

25:26.495 --> 25:28.168
That explains a lot about you, man.

25:32.099 --> 25:35.024
But um, why keep her a secret?

25:36.181 --> 25:37.732
Oh come on, you know how people are.

25:38.286 --> 25:43.134
Yeah, but if you treat this like its something to be ashamed of,

25:45.024 --> 25:47.753
your daughter will carry that around with her for the rest of her life.

25:48.018 --> 25:50.027
Well no, I’m not ashamed of her.

25:50.747 --> 25:52.207
I’m just trying to protect her.

25:53.897 --> 25:55.964
You know, my mom did the same thing.

25:58.146 --> 26:01.643
When I found out, the truth about who I was,

26:04.305 --> 26:06.445
there was a part of me that thought that maybe,

26:07.924 --> 26:11.632
she kept it a secret because she was ashamed of me.

26:13.891 --> 26:17.049
Trust me man, you don’t want to hide this.

26:27.996 --> 26:28.830
Are you gonna come?

26:30.650 --> 26:31.456
I don’t know.

26:33.229 --> 26:35.610
- I want it, it's just kind of…
- Brooke and Lucas.

26:36.228 --> 26:37.632
He told me about the other night.

26:39.778 --> 26:43.100
It’s my own fault. I blew it.

26:43.499 --> 26:44.119
Sorry.

26:45.420 --> 26:49.034
The worst part is though, Brooke is my best friend,

26:49.342 --> 26:52.429
you know and she doesn’t have any idea how much this is killing me.

26:53.586 --> 26:56.534
I don’t know what kind of karmic monster I was in my past life!

26:57.216 --> 27:00.876
Probably one of those sirens that lure in sailors and then kill them on the rocks.

27:04.472 --> 27:11.358
Look, between you and me, I really don’t see Lucas and Brooke as like an epic romance, okay?

27:12.101 --> 27:16.615
But I mean, he did ask me to give them a chance, so I kind of owe him that, you know?

27:18.465 --> 27:19.689
Well, what do you think I should do?

27:20.937 --> 27:21.694
The same thing.

27:26.503 --> 27:29.965
Never up never in Nathan. You really fell apart on the back nine.

27:30.735 --> 27:32.508
I think you told me that a few times already, Dad.

27:37.434 --> 27:39.007
Well, it was a nice try.

27:39.968 --> 27:42.171
Well, you sink this one you might actually break 100.

27:43.048 --> 27:49.395
Alright focus. Square your shoulders. Loose grip. Line it up. Good.

27:50.870 --> 27:52.123
Wow, what the hell are you doing?!

27:52.344 --> 27:53.752
Never up never in, right dad?

27:54.438 --> 27:56.359
- Hey! Watch it!
- You know, this whole thing

27:56.435 --> 28:00.029
is just another chance for you to pick me apart and show me how much better you are.

28:00.259 --> 28:03.245
Well there you go Dad, you just kicked my ass, congratulations.

28:03.521 --> 28:04.620
It was great, really.

28:05.713 --> 28:06.618
Don’t make a scene.

28:06.777 --> 28:09.936
You know what? I almost killed myself for you. You know that?

28:10.156 --> 28:10.898
What are you talking about?

28:11.216 --> 28:12.896
Drugs dad! I took drugs for you.

28:13.101 --> 28:16.070
No! My son would never take drugs.

28:16.219 --> 28:16.936
“Your son”.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.997
It’s all about you, isn’t it, dad?

28:20.550 --> 28:23.053
You know why mom kicked you out? Cause you’re a bully.

28:23.172 --> 28:25.449
And you don’t give a damn about anything other than your own ego.

28:25.500 --> 28:26.510
Would you keep your voice down?

28:26.566 --> 28:28.860
No! You know what you should do? You should give mom a divorce.

28:28.916 --> 28:31.451
You should do her a favor and give mom a divorce.

28:31.905 --> 28:34.886
She’s never going to be happy with you, dad. Nobody is!

28:46.970 --> 28:50.005
You always were a sorry paper boy.

28:51.087 --> 28:53.886
Whenever you did manage to drag your butt out of bed,

28:54.523 --> 28:58.955
I’d get the paper either through a broken window or on a working sprinkler head.

28:59.056 --> 29:02.822
Well maybe if you tipped in Holidays, it would be a different story.

29:03.723 --> 29:04.911
Pure extortion.

29:07.339 --> 29:11.671
Well, are you here to warn me about the town lynching?

29:12.352 --> 29:15.003
No firm date has been set yet, far as I know.

29:17.112 --> 29:18.444
Taking a little hiatus, huh?

29:18.991 --> 29:22.155
Extreme times call for extreme measures.

29:23.227 --> 29:27.000
Oh yeah, that’s kind of why I’m here.

29:27.813 --> 29:29.038
I need some advice.

29:29.856 --> 29:31.172
More trouble with Nathan?

29:32.079 --> 29:33.051
Nah, its Lucas.

29:34.069 --> 29:37.776
I’m worried he’s taken some wrong turns and I think I might be part of the problem.

29:38.289 --> 29:39.134
How’s that?

29:40.220 --> 29:44.755
Well, I’m not exactly a shinning example of good choices.

29:46.004 --> 29:51.211
Well, you could take a page out of my book and step back.

29:51.755 --> 29:54.233
That’s your advice? Just… do nothing?

29:54.397 --> 29:59.799
Or you could emulate your brother and smother the kid with your own short comings.

30:02.701 --> 30:04.959
Now I’ve coached 35 teams.

30:05.298 --> 30:06.844
Some of them I’ve coddled,

30:07.392 --> 30:08.882
some of them I’ve yelled at.

30:10.048 --> 30:13.048
But each player has to find his own game.

30:16.772 --> 30:19.878
Don’t worry about Lucas. He’s a good kid.

30:21.364 --> 30:23.817
He’ll find his way back to the main road.

30:32.551 --> 30:33.820
- Hey.
- Hi.

30:36.902 --> 30:38.198
You’re Gavin DeGraw.

30:38.900 --> 30:40.094
Oh yeah, that’s me.

30:40.273 --> 30:41.711
Are you playing in town?

30:41.875 --> 30:44.824
Yeah, we’re doing a gig at Carolina, and an interview.

30:44.973 --> 30:48.126
Oh, wow... Okay, not to be presumptuous or anything

30:48.183 --> 30:52.540
but you wouldn’t be interested in playing a smaller space, like a much much smaller space.

30:52.592 --> 30:55.187
There’s a thing across the street tonight. Open mic night.

30:55.234 --> 30:57.823
I know that’s way beneath you but I would score so many major cool points

30:57.905 --> 31:01.362
if you would just come and play a couple of songs. I’ll stop now!

31:01.855 --> 31:06.609
- Well, what’s the name of this place?
- Um, Karen’s Café?

31:06.655 --> 31:09.344
- It’s low key though right?
- No, totally low key.

31:10.193 --> 31:12.288
Um, maybe I’ll see you there.

31:12.898 --> 31:14.956
- Yeah maybe.
- Okay... Bye

31:15.525 --> 31:16.144
Bye.

31:21.655 --> 31:22.294
Hey.

31:23.890 --> 31:24.474
Hey.

31:33.440 --> 31:36.403
I kind of said some brutal things last night I wish I could take back.

31:36.460 --> 31:38.268
Well, obviously I suck at this.

31:39.015 --> 31:45.456
I... I want to be your friend, but I also want to do the right thing by your mom.

31:45.856 --> 31:48.241
And I know how important that is to you.

31:49.525 --> 31:51.220
I’m not really making it easy, am I?

31:51.431 --> 31:55.239
Well, at a certain point its up to you. It’s your life.

31:55.388 --> 31:59.690
And I think the best thing I can do is back off and let you live it.

32:00.441 --> 32:03.708
And if you need help, I’ll always be there.

32:06.984 --> 32:07.609
Thanks.

32:32.135 --> 32:32.940
Hey.

32:33.158 --> 32:35.432
I guess all those flyers weren’t a complete waste of trees.

32:35.571 --> 32:37.316
Thank you so much for your help.

32:38.141 --> 32:39.502
Oh, just grab an apron.

32:40.343 --> 32:43.778
Kidding! Sit wherever you want, order whatever you want on the house,

32:43.855 --> 32:44.566
I’m glad you came.

32:51.627 --> 32:53.711
So this is the place.

32:54.991 --> 32:55.984
This is it.

32:56.751 --> 32:58.042
Very buzz worthy.

33:02.803 --> 33:04.616
Cool clientele too.

33:14.184 --> 33:15.429
Listen, Deb, um…

33:16.009 --> 33:17.739
I just wanted to say you’re doing a great job.

33:18.497 --> 33:19.690
My mom will be happy.

33:20.984 --> 33:23.617
That means a lot to me, thanks Lucas.

33:23.888 --> 33:25.731
And, about the other night...

33:25.865 --> 33:28.942
Yeah, yeah I know you think I overstepped my bounds.

33:29.249 --> 33:32.946
No, its just that if you have a problem with me,

33:34.058 --> 33:35.829
could you just talk to me about it first?

33:37.759 --> 33:39.372
- You got it.
- Alright.

33:46.881 --> 33:50.051
Hey, mind if I join you?

33:54.408 --> 33:58.321
Actually, I was just leaving, I’ll see you two.

34:03.666 --> 34:04.583
I’ll be right back.

34:10.080 --> 34:10.896
Peyton!

34:15.391 --> 34:17.158
What’s going on? Are you mad at me?

34:17.686 --> 34:19.523
Its not you, Brooke, its me.

34:19.928 --> 34:24.065
I thought I was cool with this but I’m not, I’m sorry.

34:24.254 --> 34:25.196
With me and Lucas?!

34:26.368 --> 34:28.842
You do not have to feel like a third wheel.

34:29.255 --> 34:33.357
You’re my best friend. Okay? He gets that.

34:33.482 --> 34:34.848
It’s not that, Brooke.

34:35.025 --> 34:36.184
Then what is it?

34:37.190 --> 34:38.013
I just…

34:42.476 --> 34:47.402
You’re right, it’s the whole third wheel thing, I guess I just missed you.

34:48.554 --> 34:50.914
Then will you please come inside and hang out?

34:53.132 --> 34:55.502
I miss you too, okay?

34:57.340 --> 34:58.290
Come on.

35:11.221 --> 35:14.451
Hey, so I just want to remind everybody that the stage is open,

35:14.513 --> 35:17.380
if anybody has any hidden talent they want to reveal.

35:17.929 --> 35:18.886
I’ll give it a shot.

35:21.508 --> 35:25.342
Great, come on up. Thank God.

35:27.004 --> 35:29.079
Jake Jagielski, ladies and gentlemen.

35:36.432 --> 35:39.919
Um, so normally, I only sing for my daughter.

35:41.244 --> 35:47.937
But something that a friend said convinced me that I should open up to a wider audience

35:48.863 --> 35:50.655
and this seemed like the right time and place.

35:51.720 --> 35:54.240
So everyone, this is my daughter, Jenny.

35:55.155 --> 36:00.307
And Jenny, this is my whole world.

36:01.371 --> 36:02.651
Jake has a baby?

36:08.857 --> 36:09.579
You okay?

36:13.579 --> 36:16.315
- Yeah.
- Such a Lonely boy

36:16.419 --> 36:19.004
Couldn’t find the joy within

36:23.937 --> 36:26.026
Such a lonely girl

36:26.282 --> 36:30.491
Such a lonely world we’re living in

36:34.096 --> 36:37.439
I watch it all go by

36:39.042 --> 36:45.185
I can’t find a tear to cry

36:49.620 --> 36:51.272
Jerk never called you back, did he?

36:53.367 --> 36:55.727
Believe me, you didn’t want to talk to him anyways.

36:56.521 --> 36:57.780
What are you doing here?

36:57.985 --> 37:02.154
- Look I’m sorry…
- No… I’m glad you’re back.

37:02.818 --> 37:04.503
Yeah me too!

37:05.492 --> 37:11.754
It’s like, every time I’m with him, I just get caught in this rip tide, you know,

37:12.311 --> 37:15.583
the harder I try to get out, the harder it is for me to keep from downing.

37:15.860 --> 37:18.220
Maybe you just need to steer clear of the water for a little while.

37:20.172 --> 37:24.477
Hey, Nate. I thought you weren’t getting back till tomorrow, what happened?

37:25.071 --> 37:27.908
We were keeping score mom. What do you think happened?

37:27.953 --> 37:30.898
Oh honey I’m sorry, I should have known.

37:31.027 --> 37:33.388
Whatever, I’m used to it.

37:40.723 --> 37:43.575
Such a lonely boy

37:45.752 --> 37:48.557
Such a lonely girl

37:50.867 --> 37:55.443
It’s such a lonely world

38:06.476 --> 38:08.632
So what are you, like, married too?!

38:08.689 --> 38:11.101
Nah, its just me and Jenny.

38:14.046 --> 38:17.199
- She’s got your eyebrows
- Oh, that’s not a good thing!

38:17.798 --> 38:19.073
She’s beautiful.

38:20.343 --> 38:21.925
Thanks, Peyton.

38:32.403 --> 38:33.322
Thanks for coming

38:34.018 --> 38:35.883
I thought this was going to be low key.

38:36.266 --> 38:38.267
Sorry! Is it still cool?

38:38.376 --> 38:39.026
Yeah, its alright.

38:42.323 --> 38:45.840
Listen man, some of the guys and I are gonna go down to the River Court,

38:46.889 --> 38:48.401
I wanted to know if you and the team wanted to come.

38:49.537 --> 38:50.218
Why?

38:51.969 --> 38:52.917
Cause it’s fun.

38:54.884 --> 38:55.897
Don’t you remember?

39:08.215 --> 39:10.899
Alright Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Gavin DeGraw!

39:15.261 --> 39:21.064
I don't need to be anything other than a prison guard's son

39:21.430 --> 39:27.007
I don't need to be anything other than a specialist's son

39:27.682 --> 39:33.560
I don't have to be anyone other than a birth of two souls in one

39:33.928 --> 39:39.555
Part of where I'm going is knowing where I'm coming from

39:39.648 --> 39:45.717
I don't want to be anything other than what I've been trying to be lately

39:45.813 --> 39:51.209
All I have to do is think of me and I have peace of mind

39:51.936 --> 39:55.710
I'm tired of looking 'round rooms wondering what I gotta do

39:55.792 --> 39:58.147
Or who I'm supposed to be

39:58.264 --> 40:03.026
I don't want to be anything other than me

40:05.677 --> 40:09.063
Good evening everyone to a historic game of basketball.

40:09.103 --> 40:12.453
I’m Mouth McFadden and tonight this is the only game that matters.

40:26.676 --> 40:27.367
Hey.

40:27.916 --> 40:29.088
Hey, tutor girl!

40:48.293 --> 40:50.464
I guess this answers the gay question.

40:52.595 --> 40:53.464
Give me this.

40:55.317 --> 40:56.207
Get in.

40:59.336 --> 41:00.289
Cheese!

41:09.719 --> 41:11.486
I thought you might want to see this, coach.

41:13.774 --> 41:16.253
Come a long way since the last time we sat here.

41:17.218 --> 41:22.945
Uh huh. Makes you wonder where they’re all headed.

41:39.452 --> 41:40.209
Busy night?

41:42.058 --> 41:43.277
What happened today, Dan?

41:44.270 --> 41:47.649
Oh you know, we were going to spend the weekend but we missed you too much.

41:48.100 --> 41:51.448
I ask you to make good with your son and you make it worse.

41:51.960 --> 41:55.301
He flipped out on the 18th hole. It was embarrassing.

41:55.698 --> 41:57.885
And did you badger him into it?

42:02.402 --> 42:04.529
You have a problem, Dan.

42:04.710 --> 42:07.724
You’re competitive and controlling and you need some help.

42:07.828 --> 42:09.788
Since when did you become mother of the year?

42:10.782 --> 42:13.457
Last I knew you were out of sight half the month and out of mind the rest.

42:14.356 --> 42:18.032
You’re right. I have a lot of catching up to do with Nathan.

42:18.530 --> 42:21.816
But at least I’m trying to help. You on the other hand…

42:22.016 --> 42:22.969
What about me?

42:24.355 --> 42:25.664
I want you to see someone.

42:26.352 --> 42:28.845
A therapist. We’ll go as a family.

42:29.255 --> 42:30.003
Forget it.

42:30.625 --> 42:33.009
It's not a negotiation, Dan.

42:33.408 --> 42:35.890
You get some help or you’re not going to see Nathan.

42:40.355 --> 42:42.977
You really think you’re going to stop me from seeing my own son?

42:44.555 --> 42:45.777
Try me.
