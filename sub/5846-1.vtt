I've heard that you get
a lot of letters from kids.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.013

  -Sure.

00:48.015 --> 00:49.148
        -from kids that
        you don't know?
        -Sure

Why do you think
these kids write you?

             it's gonna look
             out of place, so...

   -Okay. I just feel like
   he's gonna figure it out.

      -I thought we just
      left the door open.
      -No, no, no, no, no.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.771

              When we were kids,

07:19.773 --> 07:22.040
  he would sneak into the house
  before I got home from school,

07:22.042 --> 07:24.443

       the fuck out of me.

Okay, just...
You need to settle down...

Got rid of everything,

your job at the bookstore!

You don't have anything
to worry about. All right?

09:37.277 --> 09:40.579

Um, I guess.
All right, well, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go to bed.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.622
             Uh, I mean,
             I know it's Friday,

10:23.624 --> 10:25.957
             but I was hoping
             you could move
             some things around.

10:25.959 --> 10:29.694
         Because I have an idea.
         Something for us to do.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.397
- Okay.
       -Yeah.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.132
  Well, you know Charles Manson?

10:35.334 --> 10:37.736
Uh, yeah,
I know who Charles Manson is.

10:37.738 --> 10:40.105
     Well, there are these sites
     all around the city,

10:40.107 --> 10:43.341
       um, that I was hoping
       we could go to.
       I have it all mapped out.

10:43.343 --> 10:47.078
        It's amazing 'cause,
        like, no one knows
        that, like, right there,

10:47.080 --> 10:50.482
   you know, that's
   the LaBianca house, you know.
   Or the Tate house.

10:50.484 --> 10:53.985
Wait, these are
the murder site houses?

10:53.987 --> 10:57.389
            You... You're acting
            so uptight, this is
            a thing people do.

10:57.391 --> 11:01.559
No, they don't.
No, this is the thing that
weird conspiracy people do.

11:01.561 --> 11:04.763
Trust me, I have friends
that come into LA all the time.
We've never...

11:04.765 --> 11:06.765
- Manson has never even come up.

11:06.767 --> 11:11.403
   Okay. Uh, guilty, Your Honor.
   I am interested in this,

11:11.405 --> 11:15.507
      and you're my brother,
      and I just thought
      we could do this together.

11:16.275 --> 11:18.176
            I'm just gonna
            be in town tomorrow.

11:19.078 --> 11:20.845
   Then I'm going out to my job.

11:23.315 --> 11:27.619
<i> Charles Manson</i>
  <i> set into motion a wave of</i>
 <i> terror in Southern California.</i>

11:27.621 --> 11:30.188
    <i> In two nights,</i>
    <i> Manson's murderous spree</i>

11:30.190 --> 11:34.059
 <i> took the lives</i>
 <i> of at least seven people,</i>
 <i> including actress Sharon Tate.</i>

11:34.061 --> 11:37.028
  <i> Manson was portrayed as</i>
  <i> a guitar-playing ex-convict</i>

11:37.030 --> 11:41.666
 <i> with a following of</i>
 <i> runaway young women,</i>
 <i> his so-called family members.</i>

11:41.668 --> 11:44.736
 <i> The cult, or family,</i>
 <i> spoke of launching a holy war</i>

11:44.738 --> 11:46.337
       <i> against the rich</i>
       <i> and the powerful.</i>

11:46.339 --> 11:50.308
  <i> The Tate-LaBiance murders</i>
  <i> were bizarre and merciless.</i>

11:50.310 --> 11:53.478
 <i> They triggered a public panic</i>
 <i> and raised the specter</i>

11:53.480 --> 11:57.515
   <i> of drug-crazed youths</i>
   <i> slaughtering their victims</i>
   <i> at random.</i>

12:02.988 --> 12:04.255
             Hey.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.459
      What are you doing
      in my yard?

12:07.461 --> 12:10.095
- It's mine.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.697
 You remember me?
 I'm your uncle, Conrad.

12:13.799 --> 12:15.934
No? Oh. How old are you now?

12:17.203 --> 12:19.170
                   Mmm.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.806
   Eight? Seven? Six? Five?

12:21.808 --> 12:25.076
You're going back in time.
You're a time traveler.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.178
Seven? Wow.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.714
He's always been
into stuff like this.
Like, even when he was a kid,

12:29.716 --> 12:31.616
he was into "Faces of Death".
You know what that is?

12:31.618 --> 12:33.284
      Yeah. It's horrible.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.286
Yeah, and like,
death metal, and...

12:35.288 --> 12:38.890
I don't know. He was
into 9/11 for a long time.
It's just, he's like...

12:38.892 --> 12:43.361
Just anything with death in it,
you know. He's like
all about it.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.730
    -So.
    -What's the camera for?

12:45.732 --> 12:48.266
I was thinking
I could get him
to take some pictures.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.567
      -In an artistic way?
      -Yeah.

12:49.569 --> 12:50.702
                       Oh, okay.

12:50.704 --> 12:53.538
Get the ball rolling,
kinda, inspire him.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.573
     Well, that's kind of sweet.

12:55.575 --> 12:58.309
 What's the painting you put up?

12:58.311 --> 13:00.979
 What do you mean?
 You haven't seen that before?

13:00.981 --> 13:02.147
                  No.

13:02.414 --> 13:04.048
        Huh. Oh.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.250
Figures.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.785
              What's it about?

13:06.787 --> 13:11.623
  Well, it was...
  It was a way to show
  how I felt growing up.

13:11.625 --> 13:14.359
Like, I felt sort of
like this little kid there,

13:14.361 --> 13:17.662
- with a weird face
      that didn't belong.

13:17.664 --> 13:20.064
          Why didn't you belong?

13:20.066 --> 13:23.034
   Well... You know
   I was adopted, right?

13:23.036 --> 13:24.202
                  No.

13:24.204 --> 13:27.105
My parents, your grandparents,
they couldn't have kids.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.673
  And so they adopted me.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.408
  But then
  a couple of years later,

13:30.410 --> 13:33.077
 your grandma got pregnant
 with your dad.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.679
He's their real son.

13:34.681 --> 13:39.484
And they were so happy
that he was born, that, um,
they sort of forgot about me.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.885
             That's not nice.

13:41.921 --> 13:43.288
             No.

13:48.694 --> 13:50.962
Okay, so I've got
   the whole day planned out.

13:50.964 --> 13:53.798
   First we go to the Tate house
   then the LaBianca house.

13:53.800 --> 13:58.803
    Then, if you're into it,
    um, tomorrow, we could drive
    out to the desert together.

13:59.271 --> 14:00.672
What's that book?

14:00.674 --> 14:03.508
   Well, this is <i> Helter Skelter.</i>
   You know, the classic.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.910
             It's got all, um,
             the police reports

14:05.912 --> 14:07.946
            and testimonies,
            stuff like that.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.215
 -It's actually Mom and Dads'.
 -Really?

14:10.217 --> 14:13.818
   Yeah, it was in Dad's office.
   I went into it one day
   and I opened it up.

14:13.820 --> 14:16.221
             It was just, like,
             so weird, you know,

14:16.223 --> 14:19.190
         these dead bodies,
         they're all whited out,
         you know.

14:19.192 --> 14:23.294
        It's almost more scary
        that they don't show you
        what the thing is.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.230
      And then there's all these
      pictures of Charlie

14:25.232 --> 14:27.398
    from all the different times
    he was in prison.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.100
              And then there are
              the Manson Girls,

14:29.102 --> 14:31.870
   who are just so fucking hot.
   Look at that.

14:31.872 --> 14:34.038
           But at the same time,
           you know that if
           you got with them,

14:34.040 --> 14:36.875
they could probably cut
      your dick off, too, right?

14:36.877 --> 14:39.444
That sounds...
Sounds very enticing.

14:39.446 --> 14:43.281
           It's got everything.
           It's got murder, sex,
           it's got it all.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.617
  What about, um...
  What's going on
  with those kids?

14:45.619 --> 14:49.721
     The Manson Girls have kids.
     Most of them
     were Charlie's, actually.

14:50.189 --> 14:51.389
          Wow.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.192
        Oh! Dude, um, turn here.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.261
   Oh, my God.

14:58.765 --> 15:00.531
I can't believe that
we're at the Sharon Tate house.

15:00.533 --> 15:04.068
      -Look, look.
      Hey, hey, hey. Hey.
      -Yeah?

15:04.070 --> 15:05.336
             Look what I got.

15:06.138 --> 15:07.705
What... What is that?

15:07.707 --> 15:10.808
             You wanna maybe
             shoot some photos?

15:10.810 --> 15:13.511
          Turn it into
          an art project, maybe.

15:13.513 --> 15:16.447
      -Yeah. Maybe. Cool.
      -Yeah.

15:20.452 --> 15:22.954
--The amount of excitement
   you have right now

15:22.956 --> 15:24.722
  is like, seriously
  disturbing to me.

15:24.724 --> 15:27.191
Oh, my God.

15:27.193 --> 15:28.760
     Hello.

15:28.762 --> 15:30.261
  Dude, this is like
  a historic spot.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.497
I can't believe
we can just walk right up.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.967
          -Whoa.
          -Oh, my God.

15:35.969 --> 15:37.769
That's enough.
We can just...

15:38.637 --> 15:40.638
Do you have to go
right up to the thing?

15:40.640 --> 15:42.540
     Why?
     It's a public street.

15:42.542 --> 15:43.975
--I don't think it is.

15:43.977 --> 15:46.811
It's just like in the books.

15:46.813 --> 15:49.914
  The gate is here,
  everything. Do you see that?

15:49.916 --> 15:54.619
That's where Sharon Tate's
house was, right up there.
That's where it happened.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.120
             Man, I wish
             I could get closer.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.389
  We don't need to get
  closer than this.
  This is fine.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.959
             Well, good thing is
             lot of the stuff
             happened here.

16:00.961 --> 16:03.661
       Oh, my God!
       This is probably the same

16:03.663 --> 16:06.698
     pole that Tex climbed up.
     See, they thought there was
     gonna be an alarm,

16:06.700 --> 16:10.201
      so he climbed up
      with wire cutters, and he
      snipped all the wires.

16:10.203 --> 16:14.138
   He jumped over,
   and then right then there was
   this young kid driving away.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.474
           He was just randomly
           there that night.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.942
        Never been there before.

16:17.944 --> 16:20.912
             And Tex, like,
             starts stabbing him
             through the window.

16:20.914 --> 16:22.880
          But he scooches back,
          put his hands up.

16:22.882 --> 16:25.483
        So Tex has to shoot him
        four times in the chest.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.987
--Okay. You know what?
 I'm gonna go back to the car.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.588
           -Why? Hey.
           -Because--

16:30.590 --> 16:32.190
                Oh, come on.
                I'm sorry.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.025
No. You can do whatever
you want. I'm just not
gonna be part of it.

16:34.027 --> 16:36.894
          Stop, please.
          Wait, okay? I'm sorry.

16:36.896 --> 16:38.429
      Just take a picture of me.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.165
          -All right?
          -Why?

16:41.167 --> 16:44.469
      I wanna get...
      I might do a self portrait
      from this.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.804
   -Are you fucking with me?
   -No, I'm serious.

16:47.973 --> 16:50.174
All right. Here.
Let's do it right here.

16:50.176 --> 16:53.111
              I want to get
              the gate at least.

16:53.113 --> 16:57.081
             Dude, it's the same
             fucking gate.
             That's amazing.

16:58.283 --> 17:00.018
           A lot of it
           happened on the lawn.

17:00.020 --> 17:03.421
Okay, stop talking
so I can take
the photograph, will you?

17:03.423 --> 17:04.521
         Okay, hold on, hold on.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.625
Hold on.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.460
     This guy's gonna
     call the cops.

17:11.130 --> 17:14.098
      Oh, my God.
      What are you doing?

17:14.099 --> 17:15.933
         -God damn it.
         -Oh! Come on.

17:15.935 --> 17:18.202
  Charles Manson killed
  people right here.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.104
You have to be
fucking respectful about that.

17:20.106 --> 17:22.106
              He wasn't even
              here that night.

17:22.108 --> 17:24.976
     He wasn't at the Tate house
     or the LaBianca house.

17:24.978 --> 17:26.243
    -Well...
    -He didn't kill anyone.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.146
Then why is he in jail
for murder?

17:28.147 --> 17:29.614
                      Exactly!

17:29.616 --> 17:31.516
  -I mean, it was
  a fucking conspiracy.
  -Okay. Keep your voice down.

17:31.518 --> 17:35.553
      It's because of his ideas.
      They couldn't have
      someone that free

17:35.555 --> 17:39.424
   being, living out amongst us,
   'cause it would make
   everyone else feel like,

17:39.426 --> 17:41.426
             "What are you gonna
             do with your life?"

17:41.428 --> 17:44.629
   -Keep your voice down!
   -I don't give a shit about
   those fucking people.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.931
            Hey! Charles Manson!

17:46.933 --> 17:49.000
- God damn it!

17:49.501 --> 17:51.302
           Charles Manson!

18:08.520 --> 18:09.987
            Hey.

18:12.958 --> 18:15.526
I'm sensing some tension.

18:16.361 --> 18:19.330
     Look, sorry.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.632
Let me take you
  out to lunch, okay?

18:22.434 --> 18:24.569
I know a really good place.

18:24.571 --> 18:27.472
  Are you gonna talk about
  Charles Manson the whole time?

18:29.374 --> 18:31.142
       I don't have to.

18:31.777 --> 18:35.279
               ♪

18:35.281 --> 18:37.815
There's like no limit to
 the amount you can work,

18:37.817 --> 18:39.750
      which is like,
      part of the deal
      when you become a partner.

18:39.752 --> 18:43.488
 And, you know, the money
 is commensurate with that work.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.823
          But it's... It's like,
          when do you stop?

18:45.825 --> 18:48.025
         You know what I mean?
         Like, when does it end?

18:48.027 --> 18:50.361
Hey, guys, I'll just
pick that up
when you're ready.

18:50.363 --> 18:51.262
                  Okay. Thanks.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.197
      -I got it. I got it.
      -No, I got it.

18:53.199 --> 18:54.332
            Come on.

18:55.367 --> 18:56.667
            -Really?
            -Yes.

18:56.669 --> 19:00.238
     -All right. Thank you.
     -I told you I was
     taking you out.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.074
So, wait, before we go,
I got to tell you,

19:03.076 --> 19:05.877
um, this table that
we're sitting at...

19:05.879 --> 19:07.879
This very same table.

19:07.881 --> 19:12.483
This is the same booth
that they ate at before
they went home that night.

19:13.285 --> 19:15.653
               Who? What are you
               talking about?

19:15.655 --> 19:20.591
Sharon Tate and her friends.
They ate here before that
same night they went home.

19:20.593 --> 19:23.194
And then,
Tex and the girls came.

19:23.196 --> 19:25.663
- Yeah, okay. Yeah.

19:25.665 --> 19:28.166
        -Got it. Got it.
        -Oh.

19:28.168 --> 19:30.101
       So that's why we're here.

19:30.103 --> 19:32.403
Oh, come on.
It's just a fun fact.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.972
      You think it's a fun fact,
      but it's not.

19:34.974 --> 19:38.342
             I mean, it's, like,
             really disturbing.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.744
 Okay, I'm sorry,

19:39.746 --> 19:42.446
but I mean,
it is something that I've
been thinking about that...

19:42.448 --> 19:44.615
I mean, a lot of people
ignore death,

19:44.617 --> 19:49.921
and it's something
to think about
and not just shove away.

19:49.923 --> 19:52.990
            Are you...
            Do you hear yourself
            right now?

19:52.992 --> 19:57.828
   I mean, you... You're talking
   about not ignoring death,
   and embracing it.

19:57.830 --> 20:01.599
  But when it comes to
  Dad's funeral, you don't come.
  Like, what is that?

20:01.601 --> 20:04.569
You know, we weren't
getting along. I mean...

20:04.571 --> 20:08.272
Do you know the last time
that he called me?

20:08.274 --> 20:09.974
            When's the last time
            you called him?

20:09.976 --> 20:11.809
 I gave up calling.

20:11.811 --> 20:15.379
Why? What's the point
of calling? And it's, like,
there's nothing going on.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.181
There was no exchange
going on.

20:17.183 --> 20:19.884
        Even if you're not gonna
        go to the funeral
        for Dad's sake,

20:19.886 --> 20:21.018
    you could have come for Mom.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.920
Mom's way better off,
you know.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.422
             How would you know?

20:24.424 --> 20:26.824
             You don't know.
             You're just talking
             out of your ass.

20:26.826 --> 20:29.860
  Mom was a fucking basket case.
  She found him on the floor.

20:29.862 --> 20:32.763
       She was, like, hysterical
       for weeks.

20:32.765 --> 20:37.134
 She was a wreck, I was a wreck.
 I had to do the flowers,
 I had to do the casket,

20:37.136 --> 20:38.703
       I had to do the cemetery,

20:38.705 --> 20:39.904
   I had to do the announcement,

20:39.906 --> 20:41.472
   -I had to do the invites.
   -Okay.

20:41.474 --> 20:43.407
           You know what I mean?
           I don't want to talk
           to those people.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.109
Okay.

20:45.111 --> 20:47.111
So, you can understand then...

20:47.946 --> 20:50.314
         No, I can't understand.

20:50.316 --> 20:52.750
Look, you didn't want
my help, you know.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.987
I mean, you're glad.
You're taking care
of everything again,

20:55.989 --> 20:57.688
 and you look good,
 and Mom loves you.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.925
And that's the dynamic
that you have, and,
"Oh, fucking, Connie.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.727
I know." You know.

21:03.562 --> 21:05.129
I mean, that's fine.

21:05.131 --> 21:07.031
      Yeah, that's...
      Your dynamic is just like,

21:07.033 --> 21:10.701
       oh, yeah, it's impossible
       and, you know,
       everybody hates you.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.805
    Don't they?

21:23.815 --> 21:25.583
        This car taken?

21:27.219 --> 21:29.820
Dude, I'm sorry. Okay?

21:30.422 --> 21:32.556
           Look, um...

21:32.558 --> 21:37.094
 Let's just go back to my house.
 I'm gonna go do my thing.

21:37.096 --> 21:39.163
     Why don't you take the car?
     You can do whatever,

21:39.165 --> 21:41.132
        the rest of the stuff
        you want to do today.

21:44.636 --> 21:48.139
      I think we should
      smoke together.
      All right?

21:48.141 --> 21:49.840
      I am not gonna smoke weed.

21:50.642 --> 21:52.109
            Why?

21:52.111 --> 21:54.879
  -I'm not in the mood for it.
  -That's the point.

21:54.881 --> 21:57.481
I think you need this, man.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.517
 -You have the day off, right?
 -Yeah.

21:59.519 --> 22:02.620
  Okay.
  So let's enjoy the day.

22:09.861 --> 22:13.497
You're right. I didn't
deal with Dad's death. Okay?

22:21.273 --> 22:22.873
It's really good.

22:44.896 --> 22:46.230
    How do you feel?

22:53.305 --> 22:55.306
- It's pretty good.

22:55.774 --> 22:57.174
          What are we doing?

22:57.176 --> 23:01.846
   We're going to Leo
   and Rosemary LaBianca's
   old residence.

23:04.149 --> 23:06.717
- All right.

23:32.043 --> 23:34.145
          -Is that it?
          -God.

23:34.147 --> 23:36.847
    This is the
    LaBianca house, man.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.749
Holy shit!

23:38.751 --> 23:40.551
           Come on. Come on.

23:40.553 --> 23:44.989
      I bet the kitchen is on
      this side, and the kitchen
      is key here, okay?

23:44.991 --> 23:48.959
   Because that's where they
   wrote on the fridge in blood,
   "Helter Skelter".

23:48.961 --> 23:52.229
- Oh.
-      -That all came     from this kitchen.

23:52.231 --> 23:54.565
 Oh, my God.
 I gotta get into the kitchen.

23:54.567 --> 23:56.567
                   Go, go. Go.

23:58.136 --> 24:00.070
  I wish we could get closer.

24:00.072 --> 24:01.572
                       Get up.

24:05.277 --> 24:08.379
               Oh, dude.
               There's the owner
               of the house.

24:08.381 --> 24:10.481
- What do we do?
     -I got an idea.

24:10.483 --> 24:13.284
What? What? Are you sure?

24:13.286 --> 24:15.653
      -Hey, um, excuse me.
      -What are you doing?

24:15.655 --> 24:17.588
Okay,
     just let me handle it.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.623
           Hi.

24:19.625 --> 24:23.360
     Um, we are...
     Can we talk to you
     for a second?

24:23.762 --> 24:25.296
  No, I'm sorry.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.298
- Oh.
          -No.

24:28.066 --> 24:29.700
      -Um...
      -What are you doing?

24:29.702 --> 24:32.203
      Just chill. Um...

24:32.205 --> 24:35.272
  We are the grandchildren
  of the LaBiancas.

24:38.009 --> 24:40.244
You're the grandchildren?

24:40.246 --> 24:43.714
   -You'll have to forgive me
   for being so defensive.
   -Wow.

24:43.716 --> 24:48.152
You can imagine we have
a lot of strange people
coming here all the time.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.920
          -No problem.
          -Yeah.

24:49.922 --> 24:52.022
             All is in the past,
             you know.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.691
      -Thank you.
      -Oh, you're welcome.

24:53.693 --> 24:56.994
It's amazing that
you let us in.
I just thank you so much.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.930
- Yes, what he said.

24:59.932 --> 25:02.500
       -Nice to meet you.
       -Good to meet you.
       This is Conrad.

25:02.502 --> 25:05.135
    -Hi Conrad. I'm Janice.
    -Hi. Nice to meet you.

25:05.137 --> 25:06.804
                 Beautiful skin.

25:07.572 --> 25:08.472
      Thank you.

25:08.474 --> 25:10.241
Sorry, it's
a little messy in here.

25:10.243 --> 25:13.711
Oh, no, it's beautiful.
What are you talking about?
This place is gorgeous.

25:13.713 --> 25:16.747
Oh, well, I like to
keep it neater than this.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.415
This is where the body was.

25:18.417 --> 25:19.884
         LaBianca, the guy.

25:19.886 --> 25:22.686
   They carved into his stomach.
   They stabbed him right here.

25:22.688 --> 25:23.988
Shut the fuck up.

25:23.990 --> 25:28.659
      Um, he was just saying
      that this area right here,

25:28.661 --> 25:32.596
  we have a photograph
  with us playing with
  trains right here.

25:32.598 --> 25:35.499
            This guy was so cute
            in the photos.

25:35.501 --> 25:37.034
- Yes.
          -Of course.

25:37.036 --> 25:40.571
   -Just being in this room
   is so cool It's really...
   -Yes.

25:40.573 --> 25:42.740
...you know,
             special for us.

25:42.742 --> 25:45.209
       I'm sure this is not
       a subject you're fond of,

25:45.211 --> 25:48.712
       but I was just wondering,
       you know, after
       what happened here,

25:48.714 --> 25:52.883
     do you ever feel, like,
     you know, just creeped out,
     you know?

25:52.885 --> 25:54.785
    No. Not really.

25:54.787 --> 25:59.790
It is strange, knowing
that Charles Manson was
actually in the house.

26:00.625 --> 26:02.426
       Wait. What?

26:02.428 --> 26:04.628
    Charles Manson
    was in the house?

26:04.630 --> 26:07.264
Yes. He's the one
who broke in.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.866
   That's weird,
   because I had heard

26:08.868 --> 26:12.336
  that Charles Manson
  was not a part of
  the murders at all.

26:12.338 --> 26:16.507
     Well, no, he just came in
     and tied them up, but he
     wasn't part of the murders.

26:16.509 --> 26:19.243
  You know, at the Tate house
  I told you it was such a mess.

26:19.245 --> 26:20.778
        And so they wanted to...

26:20.780 --> 26:23.280
  -He just wanted to make
  sure it was like cleaner...
  -Yeah.

26:23.282 --> 26:26.216
    You know, for... When the...
    For the LaBiancas.

26:26.218 --> 26:28.786
       -Mmm-hmm.
       -I mean, Pop Pop.
       You know.

26:28.788 --> 26:30.321
Um...

26:30.323 --> 26:32.923
I must
             sound like a freak.

26:32.925 --> 26:37.695
        I just... I mean,
        I've researched it
        because it's our family.

26:37.697 --> 26:41.332
       Anyway,
       it fucking sucks that
       that happened, obviously.

26:41.334 --> 26:43.467
      He's sorry.

26:43.469 --> 26:46.203
              Um, do you have...
              I mean, duh,

26:46.205 --> 26:48.272
             obviously,
             you have a kitchen,

26:48.274 --> 26:50.507
             but could we take
             a quick look at it?

26:51.142 --> 26:53.043
       The kitchen?

26:53.045 --> 26:54.845
Gee, I'm sorry, it's...

26:54.847 --> 26:58.449
   It's a real mess.
   Right now I'd really
   rather you didn't.

26:58.451 --> 27:01.051
         I mean, I don't mind
         if it's a little messy.

27:01.053 --> 27:02.252
Maybe some other time.

27:02.254 --> 27:04.188
       But, you know, it's fine.
       Like, I mean--

27:04.190 --> 27:06.590
 No, no, it's okay.
 It's okay.

27:06.592 --> 27:08.459
This is more than enough.

27:08.461 --> 27:11.695
            Well, I mean,
            this was kind of
            the whole point.

27:11.697 --> 27:13.864
            I guess, just 'cause
            of the memories.

27:15.500 --> 27:18.102
    -But...
    -She doesn't want
    us to go in the kitchen.

27:18.104 --> 27:19.503
              Okay. Sorry. Yeah.

27:19.505 --> 27:21.605
No, it's all right.
I understand.

27:21.607 --> 27:23.073
  Maybe another time.

27:23.075 --> 27:25.843
   You know what?
   Thank you so much
   for doing this for us.

27:25.845 --> 27:26.844
You're very welcome.

27:26.846 --> 27:29.146
You know, I actually
wanted to let you know,

27:29.148 --> 27:32.916
when we were coming in,
I saw that your retaining wall
right at the front here

27:32.918 --> 27:34.351
was sloping a little bit.

27:34.353 --> 27:36.220
    So, on the way out
    maybe I could show you that.

27:36.222 --> 27:38.756
   'Cause my wife and I went
   through the same thing.
   It was really easy to fix.

27:38.758 --> 27:39.623
            -Really?
            -Yeah.

27:39.625 --> 27:41.358
  Did you need to go
  to the bathroom?

27:41.360 --> 27:42.760
  Um, you had to go.

27:42.762 --> 27:45.295
        Oh, yeah. Okay, great.
        I'll go to the bathroom.

27:45.297 --> 27:46.597
    -Yeah.
    -I'll met you guys at...

27:46.599 --> 27:48.032
      -Cool.
      -The retaining wall.

27:48.034 --> 27:49.600
        -Just over here?
        -To the left.

27:49.602 --> 27:51.201
This is so easy to fix.

27:51.203 --> 27:52.603
        Is it the one
        with the bricks?

27:52.605 --> 27:54.471
Yeah, you gotta
catch it now, though.

27:56.307 --> 27:58.842
               ♪

28:13.759 --> 28:15.592
Hey.

28:15.594 --> 28:18.429
     -Who are you?
     -Who the fuck are you?

28:18.431 --> 28:20.431
  I'm sorry. I just... You're...

28:20.433 --> 28:22.666
   Is that
   a Charlie Manson t-shirt?

28:23.668 --> 28:26.670
        Hey! Nick!
        Dude, abort!

28:26.672 --> 28:28.972
   -What are you doing?
   -Get the hell out of here!

28:28.974 --> 28:30.774
Hey!

28:32.043 --> 28:34.578
Frank!
   Frank, what are you doing?

28:34.580 --> 28:37.514
I wake up from my nap
and this guy's in our kitchen

28:37.516 --> 28:40.851
 taking pictures
 in a Charlie Manson shirt.

28:40.853 --> 28:41.819
                 What?

28:41.821 --> 28:44.688
   -I'm sorry. I can explain.
   -Explain!

28:57.669 --> 28:59.770
Hey.
         Excuse me.

29:01.072 --> 29:04.208
      This is why we end up
      feeling like prisoners
      in our own home.

29:06.211 --> 29:09.113
   I'm sorry.
   I'm so sorry.

29:09.115 --> 29:12.716
            I mean, you did
            choose to live here.
            I mean...

29:12.718 --> 29:17.454
     I had no idea what we'd be
     getting ourselves into when
     we bought this place.

29:17.456 --> 29:19.389
I don't understand you.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.592
        A horrible thing
        happened here!

29:21.594 --> 29:23.761
          And you want
          to celebrate that?

29:25.163 --> 29:27.131
 Haven't you ever lost anyone?

29:32.437 --> 29:35.639
I was, like,
 telling somebody the other day
 my dad's dead.

29:35.641 --> 29:38.542
  -I was, like,
  trying to be cool about it.
  -Mmm-hmm.

29:38.544 --> 29:41.645
          But it's, like, weird
          to say it, you know.

29:41.647 --> 29:45.649
I don't know.
          It's just weird.

29:45.651 --> 29:49.319
 But here we are,
 here, a perfect family.

29:49.321 --> 29:52.990
           This is the best shot
           of you guys.

29:52.992 --> 29:55.926
         Like, you, Mom and Dad.
         This is, like, what's
         always in my head.

29:55.928 --> 29:58.428
Yeah.
I hate that fucking photo.

29:58.430 --> 29:59.863
                 You do?

30:00.565 --> 30:02.366
             -Yes.
             -Why?

30:02.368 --> 30:05.702
You can see how
he fucking felt about me.
He's not even touching me.

30:05.704 --> 30:08.572
          He's just posing
          for a photograph, man.

30:08.574 --> 30:12.376
Okay, do you want to fucking
argue about the composition
of the photo?

30:12.378 --> 30:16.480
We're talking about reality,
and how the guy was
kind of a dick.

30:16.482 --> 30:21.084
    I personally think
    that you expected Dad to do
    everything for you as a kid.

30:21.086 --> 30:24.988
  -But, like...
  -No, just to love me, maybe.

30:25.757 --> 30:27.624
    He's an army guy, all right?

30:27.626 --> 30:32.329
   And he has, you know,
   he has that power thing,
   and that's part of his setup.

30:32.331 --> 30:36.133
       Like, you had to add that
       to that a little bit,
       if you want...

30:36.668 --> 30:38.135
  That's not love.

30:38.137 --> 30:41.705
That's not raising someone
to be their own person.

30:41.707 --> 30:44.208
That's making
a little fucking clone.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.910
       So, uh, so what,
       I'm dad's little soldier?

30:46.912 --> 30:48.512
                That's basically
                how you see me?

30:48.514 --> 30:50.681
I mean, you have a kid,
you got the wife.

30:50.683 --> 30:52.282
You know, everything,
which is good. I'm just...

30:52.284 --> 30:54.351
  -Yeah, I have a kid
  and a wife.
  -It's a lot of good things.

30:54.353 --> 30:57.788
You made him happy,
he gave you money
because you were going

30:57.790 --> 31:01.525
  -to "law school" and that's
  such a great thing to do.
  -"Law school?"

31:01.527 --> 31:05.162
        You don't put air quotes
        around law school.
        It's a real thing.

31:05.164 --> 31:08.498
    Which is how I earn a living
    and buy food

31:08.500 --> 31:10.634
        to put inside the people
        inside the house.

31:10.636 --> 31:12.903
Yeah, it seems like it's
working out great for you.

31:19.410 --> 31:22.012
That's it, huh? Hey!

31:23.114 --> 31:25.949
You know, dad wasn't
the only one in the family

31:25.951 --> 31:29.386
  who treated me like
  a fucking outcast, okay?

31:29.388 --> 31:32.155
You did your fair share
of treating me like
a piece of shit.

31:50.642 --> 31:52.409
   Do you know
   where the Melatonin is?

31:52.411 --> 31:54.745
         No, I'm sorry, I don't.

31:56.047 --> 31:58.782
  I don't understand
  how it disappears.

31:58.784 --> 32:01.351
 Like, who takes the
 Melatonin?

32:04.656 --> 32:06.924
       You seem really agitated.
       Is something wrong?

32:08.393 --> 32:12.329
Conrad basically thinks
that I threw him under the bus
our entire childhood.

32:12.331 --> 32:15.165
And that I got
special treatment.

32:17.468 --> 32:19.069
                      Yeah.

32:20.338 --> 32:21.605
What do you mean, "Yeah"?

32:21.607 --> 32:25.342
You know that you and your dad
had a really strong bond, right?

32:25.344 --> 32:27.945
     -Mmm-hmm.
     -And I can understand
     how Connie

32:27.947 --> 32:30.514
         probably felt
         excluded from you guys.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.450
Okay, he excluded himself.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.118
             But that doesn't...
             Why?

32:35.120 --> 32:38.822
That's what he does.
He likes to, like,
act like the outsider,

32:38.824 --> 32:43.260
and like, push people away,
and poke and prod people.
He gets off on that shit.

32:43.262 --> 32:45.495
         Why would he get off
         on something like that?

32:45.497 --> 32:47.864
Because he's
messed up in the head.

32:47.866 --> 32:49.633
    -Genetically, probably.
    -Dude.

32:49.635 --> 32:52.569
Like, I looked into
his adoption one time,

32:52.571 --> 32:55.005
and it said that he
was a ward of the state.

32:55.007 --> 32:56.773
                 That's so mean.
                 Stop it.

32:56.775 --> 32:58.408
   You asked me,
   and my answer is

32:58.410 --> 33:01.345
I think there's
some weird chemistry
going on in his brain.

33:03.681 --> 33:06.817
          Well, I think that
          no matter what Connie,

33:06.819 --> 33:09.086
            or anyone ever does,

33:09.088 --> 33:11.488
             they will never
             measure up for you.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.090
           No one's good enough.

33:15.727 --> 33:17.527
        Great. Okay.

33:18.629 --> 33:20.397
     Can I get a pillow?

33:22.633 --> 33:24.234

33:28.474 --> 33:30.774

        of the truth.

33:30.776 --> 33:32.075
God's messenger?

33:32.077 --> 33:35.445
      Life's messenger.
      But we use the word "God".

33:36.280 --> 33:38.382

34:19.091 --> 34:22.626
           Oh, this is a book,
           uh,<i> Helter Skelter.</i>

34:22.628 --> 34:23.994
             Are there pictures?

34:23.996 --> 34:26.663
         Um, yeah.
         Um, a couple.

34:26.665 --> 34:30.233
Hold on, hold on.
Let me see which ones
are okay to look at.

34:30.534 --> 34:32.235
Wait, wait.

34:32.237 --> 34:35.639
  Yeah, there's a nice
  picture of a family.

34:35.641 --> 34:37.940
           Are they real
           brothers and sisters?

34:37.943 --> 34:39.876
     No, they're, um,

34:39.878 --> 34:42.512
  they're not a real family.
  It's actually better
  than a real family

34:42.514 --> 34:45.014
   because they went out
   and found each other.

34:45.016 --> 34:47.451
   What are they doing
   in the middle of this desert?

34:47.453 --> 34:51.353
   Well, they...
   They wanted to get
   away from society

34:51.356 --> 34:53.757
and from people
that didn't understand them,

34:53.759 --> 34:56.827
you know, because that was
like hurting them,

34:56.829 --> 34:58.829
  other peoples
  perception of them.

34:58.831 --> 35:02.399
     So they went out here
     and they got a big bus,

35:02.401 --> 35:04.067
    and you know, they cared
    about the environment.

35:04.069 --> 35:06.636
They wanted to get back
into touch with something,

35:06.638 --> 35:09.039
  you know, more real.

35:09.041 --> 35:11.808
      What are all of these
      dead people?

35:11.810 --> 35:16.480
    Oh, um, they're just
    some people who just,
    I don't know...

35:16.482 --> 35:18.949
They were in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

35:18.951 --> 35:20.317
               Like Grandpa?

35:20.319 --> 35:23.920
No. Grandpa died
because he had a heart attack.

35:23.922 --> 35:26.756
  Um, these people
  were actually killed.

35:26.758 --> 35:28.625
But Grandpa, like,
killed himself in a way

35:28.627 --> 35:32.863
because he was...
worked himself up
all the time.

35:32.865 --> 35:34.264
         What are you guys
         talking about?

35:34.266 --> 35:36.633
         Oh, nothing,
         just hanging out,
         playing...

35:36.635 --> 35:39.202
   We're reading <i> Helter Skelter.</i>

35:39.204 --> 35:42.639
    There's really cool pictures
    of dead people.

35:50.581 --> 35:52.182
               All right,
               before you start,

35:52.184 --> 35:55.185
 I was just looking at the book,
 he asked me questions.

35:55.187 --> 35:56.987
    He's curious.
    What am I gonna fucking say?

35:56.989 --> 35:58.755
-You're showing him dead bodies?
-I was trying to...

35:58.757 --> 36:00.423
 You're showing him
 the Manson family?

36:00.425 --> 36:02.225
 What else are
 you gonna show him?

36:02.227 --> 36:04.361
       I'm sorry,
       but he's the one who
       kept asking me questions.

36:04.363 --> 36:07.631
He's a child.
He's gonna want to do
whatever you want to do.

36:07.633 --> 36:09.166
  You just say no.

36:09.168 --> 36:11.134
If he wants to look at it
you just say no.
That's what you do.

36:11.136 --> 36:13.937
             Why? I'm not gonna
             fucking lie to him.

36:13.939 --> 36:16.406
Why don't you just
open up Internet fucking porn

36:16.408 --> 36:18.108
- and show him everything
    that's out there.

36:18.110 --> 36:19.943
It's not funny, dude.
He's having a really hard time

36:19.945 --> 36:22.045

putting your shit on him.

36:22.047 --> 36:24.247
           Okay. Well, why is he
           having a hard time?

36:24.249 --> 36:27.184
"Why is he
having a hard time?"
He's a child.

36:28.085 --> 36:30.353
Growing up is hard.
People have hard times.

36:30.355 --> 36:33.924

40:59.491 --> 41:01.558
         -Jesus Christ!
         -What?

41:01.560 --> 41:02.926
                       A cop.

41:05.996 --> 41:07.230
             Pull over.

41:07.232 --> 41:09.232
    I wasn't even
    fucking doing anything!

41:09.234 --> 41:10.934
            Well, pull over.

41:10.936 --> 41:12.669
       Dude, I can't. I can't!

41:12.671 --> 41:13.670
                   Why?

41:13.672 --> 41:15.638
         -Pull over.
         -Fucking shit! Okay!

41:23.113 --> 41:26.749
         Dude, um,
         we got to switch seats.

41:26.751 --> 41:29.219
     -What?
     -Dude, come on,
     switch seats with me.

41:29.221 --> 41:32.155
    -Why?
    -I just... I was
    trying to help you out.

41:34.425 --> 41:36.326
         -Roll it down.
         -Okay.

41:37.695 --> 41:39.729
  Hello. Hi.

41:39.731 --> 41:41.364
         Do you know why
         I pulled you over, sir?

41:41.366 --> 41:44.601
Um, yeah, I know
I might have swerved
a little bit.

41:44.603 --> 41:47.003
But I was just, like,
dropped a CD.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.873
You know, it got
all scratched up and I was
trying to clean it off.

41:49.875 --> 41:54.344
Anyway, but it's back in there,
we're fine. Thank you
for the reminder.

41:54.346 --> 41:57.714
      Uh-huh. Can I see
      your license, registration
      and insurance, please?

41:59.149 --> 42:01.784
It's really not necessary.
I mean...

42:01.786 --> 42:04.220
         Here's the registration
         and insurance.

42:04.222 --> 42:05.889
        Sir, please keep
        your hands on the wheel.

42:05.891 --> 42:07.457
                         Okay.

42:07.958 --> 42:09.826
 Just do what he says.

42:09.828 --> 42:11.461
           And the license, sir?

42:14.164 --> 42:16.766
      You do not have
      a drivers license,
      is that what I understand?

42:16.768 --> 42:19.168
No. Are you gonna
give me a big lecture now?

42:19.170 --> 42:22.705
    Do you realize it is
    a serious offense to operate
    a vehicle without a license?

42:22.707 --> 42:25.141
     I can take you in right now
     and impound this vehicle.

42:25.143 --> 42:28.011
I'm so happy
you have such power over me.

42:28.013 --> 42:29.712
    Have you been drinking, sir?

42:29.714 --> 42:32.215
   No, I have not
   been drinking, sir.

42:32.217 --> 42:33.383
      All right, watch the tone.

42:33.385 --> 42:35.351
 We've just had
 a really tough ride.

42:35.353 --> 42:37.754
My brother and I
are not getting along well.

42:37.756 --> 42:39.589
 Okay, I need you to put
 your hands on the hood, please.

42:39.591 --> 42:42.058
  -I'm trying to talk to you.
  -Do not resist me.

42:42.060 --> 42:43.293
          Do not resist me.

42:43.295 --> 42:45.495
              I'm not fucking...
              Jesus Christ!

42:45.497 --> 42:47.997
 -Do you have a weapon on you?
 -No!

42:47.999 --> 42:50.800
Does that feel good,
to fucking grab me, you pig?

42:50.802 --> 42:51.734
         Stop talking!

42:58.943 --> 43:00.510
You're free to go.

43:05.683 --> 43:08.151
Jesus,
   that guy was such a dick.

43:08.153 --> 43:10.954
               The cop that
               you called a pig?

43:11.488 --> 43:14.057
He was.

43:15.259 --> 43:17.193
    How much was it?

43:17.195 --> 43:19.462
           Um, it was not cheap.

43:19.897 --> 43:21.931
     Shit. How much?

43:21.933 --> 43:23.633
           -Thousand.
           -Thousand?

43:23.635 --> 43:24.734
                       Yeah.

43:24.736 --> 43:27.103
I talked them
down to 600, though.

43:27.105 --> 43:28.237
- Really?
       -Yeah.

43:28.239 --> 43:29.539
    -That's great.
    -I know, it's what I do.

43:29.541 --> 43:31.274
    All right.
    Here, I'll pay you back.

    I told you,
    I sold all my stuff.

43:46.091 --> 43:48.958

  -And he's into weird stuff.

 with people, like,

49:50.088 --> 49:53.189
you know, bleeding
out of their faces. Right?

49:53.191 --> 49:55.658
                Well, Dad died.

49:55.660 --> 49:57.560
    -Yeah.
    -He's dealing with that.

49:57.562 --> 50:00.463
             You know,
             he's working it out
             in the drawings.

50:02.966 --> 50:04.133
        Yeah.

50:04.135 --> 50:06.168

50:06.170 --> 50:08.404

50:52.116 --> 50:55.718
I...
          I hadn't noticed that.

50:55.720 --> 50:57.219
          I'm gonna just go over
          and talk to him.

50:57.221 --> 50:59.555
   Wait, wait a second.
   What the fuck is going on?

51:00.223 --> 51:01.824
I...

51:01.826 --> 51:04.994
      I don't know. I mean...
      I'll tell you after, okay?
      I just gotta talk--

51:04.996 --> 51:07.730
    No, no, no, no, no, no.
    Talk to me first.

51:07.732 --> 51:10.366
Talk to me first.
What is that?

51:10.368 --> 51:13.169
Tell me what the fuck
is going on with that
Manson t-shirt.

51:13.171 --> 51:16.205
        Okay,
        the environmental group,

51:16.207 --> 51:19.708
       they have a slight
       association with Charlie.

51:19.710 --> 51:21.577
      He just started the group.

51:21.579 --> 51:23.345
He started
the environmental group?

51:23.347 --> 51:27.349
   Yes. This group is picking up
   on the positive aspects
   of his philosophy.

51:27.351 --> 51:29.685
  He was actually
  talking about the environment,

51:29.687 --> 51:31.087
         you know,
         before a lot of people.

51:31.089 --> 51:33.089
You're coming out here
to work with Charles Manson?

51:33.790 --> 51:35.357
         -Dude.
         -See, I knew.

51:35.359 --> 51:37.693
      I fucking
      bring up Charles Manson
      and you fucking freak out.

Everybody freaks out!

51:39.097 --> 51:41.897
Everybody freaks out
when you bring up
Charles Manson!

51:42.933 --> 51:45.134
      Fuck! Where did he go? Oh.

51:47.370 --> 51:48.904
                 Shit.

51:50.207 --> 51:52.541
   Come on!
   He's getting away.

51:52.543 --> 51:54.643
Okay, here's the deal.

51:54.645 --> 51:56.512
I am willing
to follow this guy,

51:56.514 --> 51:58.714
but you don't
get out of the car
until I say so.

51:58.716 --> 51:59.949

51:59.951 --> 52:02.184
Okay, okay. All right.

52:02.186 --> 52:03.886
Shit,
             go around this guy.

52:03.888 --> 52:05.521
All right, I'm not
gonna get too close.

52:05.523 --> 52:08.090
  -Yeah, yeah.
  -We'll just wait and
  let's just see what happens.

52:08.092 --> 52:09.692
What is the plan?
What are we doing?

52:09.694 --> 52:12.294
      I gotta show him
      this letter I have,
      and it'll be fine.

52:12.296 --> 52:15.164
    -Blackbird should
    know who I am.
    -What's with the names?

52:15.166 --> 52:16.565
      Blackbird.

52:16.567 --> 52:18.734
        Charlie gives
        everybody nicknames.

52:18.736 --> 52:20.536
He's turning, he's turning.

52:20.538 --> 52:21.737
Go, go, go.

52:21.739 --> 52:23.272
                           Nice!

52:27.677 --> 52:29.578
Where the fuck did he go?

52:29.580 --> 52:31.280
                Go... Go faster.

52:41.691 --> 52:43.692
               Whoa, whoa, whoa.
               Hold up. Hold up.

52:48.031 --> 52:50.699
       He must have
       gone around back.

52:50.701 --> 52:52.868
Hold on a second.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

52:52.870 --> 52:54.403
Where'd he go?

52:55.639 --> 52:57.273
       -Hello?
       -He was just here.

52:57.275 --> 52:59.141
Can you slow down?

53:17.194 --> 53:18.260
                       Hey!

53:18.828 --> 53:19.995

           Leave him alone!

       Wait! I'm Conrad!

53:36.981 --> 53:38.547

   He told me I could
   work with you guys!

53:41.118 --> 53:43.219
I'm Conrad Morgan!

You're Captain Morgan?

53:52.630 --> 53:55.864

    about you all the time.

 -Okay. Yeah.

54:00.204 --> 54:02.204
- Come on.
-      -I'm sorry.

54:03.907 --> 54:06.041
  Lean back.
  This eye.

54:06.043 --> 54:08.577
      -Okay.
      -You've gotta just
      keep it open for me.

54:08.579 --> 54:11.046
Okay. No, you have to open it.

54:11.048 --> 54:13.048
     -It's, like, burning.
     -There we go. Quickly.

54:13.050 --> 54:15.651
       -Okay, go.
       -It sees the thing
       and it retracts.

54:15.653 --> 54:19.722
I know. They're like
two little angry clams.

54:19.724 --> 54:22.791
What?

54:22.793 --> 54:24.893
They're chomping down.

54:24.895 --> 54:26.629
          -Other eye.
          -Okay.

54:27.430 --> 54:29.732
   One, two...

54:29.734 --> 54:31.700
--Now blink that eye.

54:33.236 --> 54:35.137
Breathe.
In through your nose.

54:35.139 --> 54:37.539
--Out through your mouth.

54:44.881 --> 54:47.082
--Now I can see you.

54:48.251 --> 54:50.052
      Good.

54:50.054 --> 54:52.288
 You look better.

54:52.290 --> 54:55.858
Your eyes are so blue,
like icicles.

55:00.063 --> 55:02.197
I'm gonna go
put this stuff away.

            Thanks.

        Oh, my God.

55:12.743 --> 55:14.576
             What did she say?

55:14.578 --> 55:18.647
She said, "I don't mind
that you saw me naked."

55:18.649 --> 55:21.317
             You can't do that.

55:21.319 --> 55:23.152
         I think that's
         Blackbird's girlfriend.

55:23.154 --> 55:25.287
 I don't know.
 I don't think so.

55:25.289 --> 55:29.458

  get hit in the head with
  a fucking lead pipe, you know.

55:30.860 --> 55:34.630
   And what's with...
   You wrote a letter to Manson?

55:36.266 --> 55:39.501
    -Yeah.
    -And he wrote you back?

55:39.503 --> 55:43.906
You know, I mean,
we have stuff in common,
like, you know, he...

55:43.908 --> 55:46.208
never knew
who his dad was and stuff,

55:46.210 --> 55:49.011
and had a tough time
growing up.

55:49.013 --> 55:52.381
I know it sounds weird,
but, yeah, just...

55:52.383 --> 55:55.651
I was not doing that well
and I wrote him,

55:56.252 --> 55:58.387
and he wrote me back and...

55:58.888 --> 56:00.422
 that's pretty cool.

56:00.424 --> 56:03.992
The things he said, it was...
It helped me a lot.

56:03.994 --> 56:05.394
           And what did he say?

56:09.733 --> 56:12.134
       Conrad, come here.

56:12.136 --> 56:14.470
I'm gonna talk a walk with you.
There's something I want
to show you.

56:14.472 --> 56:16.872
Something that you're
probably gonna be
pretty excited to see.

56:17.307 --> 56:18.907
Can my brother come?

56:20.210 --> 56:21.944
         Suit yourself.

56:28.752 --> 56:30.719
 Conrad, I don't know
 if you're aware of this,

56:30.721 --> 56:35.090
but, uh, they threw
Charlie into solitary
couple of weeks ago.

56:35.092 --> 56:37.426
    -So I haven't
    been able to reach him.
    -Uh-huh.

56:38.261 --> 56:39.728
He's supposed to
get out pretty soon,

56:39.730 --> 56:42.097
but you never know with
these fucking pigs up there.

56:42.099 --> 56:43.332
                   Yeah.

56:43.334 --> 56:45.534
       Why'd they
       throw him in solitary?

56:46.569 --> 56:48.237
         Why?

56:51.141 --> 56:53.642
  You think they
  need a reason why?

56:53.644 --> 56:56.745
         Yeah, they don't
         need a reason,
         you know, with Charlie.

56:56.747 --> 56:59.047
       Well, he's in
       the legal system.
       I would think that they'd

56:59.049 --> 57:01.550
           have to have a reason
           to put him in
           solitary confinement.

57:02.285 --> 57:04.420
They like blaming Charlie.

57:04.422 --> 57:06.555
   He's their Christ
   on the cross.

57:07.590 --> 57:10.225

never gonna take him down.
