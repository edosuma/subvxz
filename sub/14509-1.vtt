(MAN) Now listen. Tell Simon that
Tommy has the plans and the model.

01:42.327 --> 01:45.524
I'll be back in about ten days,
and I can take over then.

01:47.407 --> 01:49.477
Well, it's all come at a bad time, really.

01:49.647 --> 01:51.524
Dan? Hello?

01:51.687 --> 01:53.882
It always happens in the same place.

01:55.687 --> 01:58.326
Quite convenient, actually.

01:58.487 --> 02:01.559
You're having a few days
away from the wee ones, are you?

02:03.207 --> 02:05.960
Er, just a bit of peace and quiet, really.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.515
You're going to the right place
for that, boy.

02:57.447 --> 02:59.324
There you go.

02:59.487 --> 03:02.081
Now, the CB
goes straight through to me.

03:02.247 --> 03:03.600
If you need help, just call.

03:03.767 --> 03:06.281
I'll be over on Saturday
unless I hear from you. OK?

03:06.447 --> 03:08.119
- Thank you, Doug.
- Thanks, Doug.

03:08.287 --> 03:09.925
Be good!

(WHISTLING A TUNE)

04:07.927 --> 04:10.157
Kate! I was thinking we'd go for a walk.

04:10.327 --> 04:11.919
Maybe after breakfast?

04:15.007 --> 04:17.237
- Kate?
- Uh-huh?

04:17.406 --> 04:21.241
I was thinking we could do that walk.
You know the one? Around the coast?

04:21.406 --> 04:25.161
- (TYPING)
- Let's just see how I go with this, OK?

04:26.967 --> 04:29.003
OK. Yeah.

04:46.967 --> 04:48.480
(GASPS) Oh...

04:54.927 --> 04:56.440
You OK?

04:56.607 --> 04:58.165
Ready?

04:59.127 --> 05:01.880
- Aw, no, they're babies!
- What are you talking about?

05:02.047 --> 05:05.562
We'll grill these two feckers on toast
with a bit of lemon, and mwah!

(JET FLIES OVERHEAD)

05:09.567 --> 05:13.162

Wow.

05:55.647 --> 05:58.161
Look at that.

06:01.927 --> 06:03.599
Mm.

06:07.487 --> 06:10.843
- 2002, huh?
- Mm-hm.

06:15.287 --> 06:18.085
All right. I'll get rid of these.

- It was a cold bath.

09:04.367 --> 09:06.835
Doug'll be here in the morning.
He'll sort it out.

09:07.007 --> 09:08.645
Good.

(SIGHS)

09:19.927 --> 09:22.236
I don't recall it giving us any trouble
last time.

09:22.407 --> 09:24.921
It's a while since
you've been here, though.

09:25.087 --> 09:28.443
Now, she's full of character,
I'll give you that.

09:28.607 --> 09:30.837
She's never down for long.

No, I tried that, mate. It didn't work.

09:34.927 --> 09:36.519
- There we are.
- (STEADY WHIR)

09:36.687 --> 09:38.917
You've got to keep it down
for a count of three.

09:39.087 --> 09:41.078
- Ah.
- Keep it down hard, mind.

09:41.247 --> 09:46.685
To kick-start her again, read these
and that'll do the trick. Good man.

09:46.847 --> 09:48.644
Right.

09:49.887 --> 09:52.606
Oh! I almost forgot.

09:52.767 --> 09:55.600
- There's a present from Mrs. Doug.
- Ah!

09:55.767 --> 09:58.759
Now, she baked them specially,
so watch your teeth.

09:58.927 --> 10:01.441
That's very kind.
Tell her thanks very much from us.

10:01.607 --> 10:05.156
Not much for her to do up this part
of the world. It's that, or talk to me.

10:05.327 --> 10:08.239
- And I tell you, I'm never short of cake.
- (CHUCKLES)

10:09.127 --> 10:11.322

- Good.

10:11.487 --> 10:13.523
Not gone mad yet?

10:13.687 --> 10:16.997
No, we love this island.
We've had some good times here.

10:17.167 --> 10:19.078
You've found them again, have you?

10:28.047 --> 10:32.279

- Kate, I was calling you.

11:10.527 --> 11:12.597
Just give me a minute, OK?

- Oh, it's gone again.

That's a good look.

11:58.887 --> 12:00.957
Oh. Yeah. Thanks.

12:01.127 --> 12:03.402
I was just running a bath,
and it just went.

12:03.567 --> 12:05.444
- Any luck.
- No.

12:05.607 --> 12:08.804
I've held it down for three.
That doesn't seem to be working.

12:08.967 --> 12:11.322

practically blew up on him. Over.

It's a hairy old thing, but I didn't know
it had gone that bad. Over.

12:42.967 --> 12:45.197
Doug, it's... Don't worry.

12:45.367 --> 12:47.676
Aye, well, I'll bring my doctor
over anyway.

12:47.847 --> 12:51.886
It'll be tomorrow now. Don't touch
the generator until we get there. Over.

13:50.407 --> 13:53.399
I guess I'll try and call him
on the CB again.

13:53.567 --> 13:57.640
Yeah. It's just impossible
to cook on a fire.

Could we row to him?
Could we row to the mainland?

15:33.687 --> 15:38.602
- It's miles away. It's freezing.
- OK. So we could be just stranded here.

15:38.767 --> 15:41.122
Please don't be silly. Come on.

15:41.287 --> 15:44.120
What did we think, coming back here?

15:44.287 --> 15:46.198
Coming back to the same place,

15:46.367 --> 15:49.279
like we're gonna just solve
all our problems.

I don't see what that has to do with this.

being back here!

He's got to have come on a boat
from the mainland.

18:03.087 --> 18:05.078
Then the boat would be at the beach.

18:06.247 --> 18:08.203

but I haven't been able to get through.

24:01.727 --> 24:03.240
Maybe you could have a look.

24:03.407 --> 24:05.443
I should be able to fix it.

Yes. Doug is... Doug is the owner.
He's on the mainland.

Ah.

24:32.727 --> 24:34.240
It's just in there.

I'm gonna tell you something,

26:04.927 --> 26:06.645
and you're gonna listen.

And then you're gonna do as I say.

to the safety of you and your wife.

Yeah.

I'm telling you that a highly contagious

27:12.887 --> 27:14.843

27:21.887 --> 27:26.085

28:37.287 --> 28:39.437

out there, a pandemic.

29:17.047 --> 29:18.639
- It's killing everybody...
- What?!

29:18.807 --> 29:21.275

That's what he told me.

sealing up his house like everyone else.

is that for the moment

the risk of a virus.

- No.

01:10:55.687 --> 01:10:57.484
(RASPS)

01:10:57.647 --> 01:10:59.319
Jack.

01:11:00.327 --> 01:11:04.605
We don't care what's out there.
We... we don't want to die here.

01:11:06.087 --> 01:11:07.805
The disease isn't outside.

01:11:10.167 --> 01:11:11.680
It's in here.

01:11:13.727 --> 01:11:15.046
It's right here.

01:11:15.887 --> 01:11:17.206
You liar!

01:11:17.367 --> 01:11:18.766
Agh!

01:11:30.647 --> 01:11:32.797
Who the fuck are you?

01:11:32.967 --> 01:11:35.197
And I want the truth.

01:11:50.847 --> 01:11:53.156
My husband's dying.

01:11:53.327 --> 01:11:54.919
Tell me.

01:12:04.367 --> 01:12:06.164
They gave me a choice.

01:12:07.967 --> 01:12:12.597
Do time in prison,
or go to a military hospital.

01:12:14.087 --> 01:12:17.477
At the hospital
they started testing these new drugs.

01:12:17.647 --> 01:12:19.478
I was a lab rat.

01:12:19.647 --> 01:12:21.638
They lied to me!

01:12:24.287 --> 01:12:27.484
And they filled me full of this shit.

01:12:30.727 --> 01:12:34.037
They gave me this fatal fuckin' disease.

01:12:35.247 --> 01:12:36.839
They gave it to me.

01:12:38.767 --> 01:12:41.600
- You escaped?
- No.

01:12:42.767 --> 01:12:45.156
Then they just let me walk away.

01:12:47.127 --> 01:12:48.606
They made a mistake.

01:12:48.767 --> 01:12:51.759
They discharged me
when they shouldn't have done.

01:12:53.287 --> 01:12:57.519
Then my wife came
by the training centre to pick me up.

01:12:58.887 --> 01:13:01.685
How was I supposed to know
I was contagious?

01:13:07.687 --> 01:13:09.484
I gave it to her.

01:13:12.527 --> 01:13:14.324
I gave it to my wife.

01:13:21.167 --> 01:13:22.759
I killed her.

01:13:25.607 --> 01:13:27.006
(SNIFFLES)

01:13:29.647 --> 01:13:31.444
Why should I believe you?

01:13:32.607 --> 01:13:34.837
Did you kill Doug and his wife?

01:13:36.287 --> 01:13:37.686
Did you?

01:13:40.567 --> 01:13:42.637
They found me in their boat shed.

01:13:42.807 --> 01:13:46.436
I had to get off the mainland
and make a crossing.

01:13:47.327 --> 01:13:49.921
I knew that I was the carrier.

01:13:50.087 --> 01:13:52.521
So I made them take me out to sea.

01:13:53.527 --> 01:13:55.165
They got it really quick.

01:13:55.327 --> 01:13:58.683
Maybe because they were older, but...
What would you have done?

01:13:58.847 --> 01:14:00.997
What would you have done?

01:14:01.407 --> 01:14:03.204
You knew we'd be infected.

01:14:04.087 --> 01:14:07.762
You knew it wasn't outside.
It was in you.

01:14:07.927 --> 01:14:10.282
You took me in.

01:14:11.287 --> 01:14:14.404
You took me in. I couldn't stop that.

01:14:14.567 --> 01:14:18.685
But I couldn't let you go outside and
risk infecting others. I had to contain it.

01:14:18.847 --> 01:14:20.678
I had to contain me!

01:14:22.207 --> 01:14:23.720
But I swear to you...

01:14:25.287 --> 01:14:27.084
I never wanted to kill anyone.

01:14:27.887 --> 01:14:29.206

01:17:30.647 --> 01:17:32.444
You knew it worked.

01:17:32.607 --> 01:17:34.643
I couldn't have you contacting anyone.

01:17:39.167 --> 01:17:42.876
...members of the public. An armed
and dangerous man has escaped

01:17:43.047 --> 01:17:45.607
from a secure military compound
in your area.

01:17:45.767 --> 01:17:49.442
Private Jack Coleman was last seen
wearing green combat fatigues.

01:17:49.607 --> 01:17:52.075
Under no circumstances
should you approach him.

01:17:52.247 --> 01:17:57.560

- You tell them.

01:18:08.567 --> 01:18:10.046
I can't do that.

01:18:11.127 --> 01:18:12.606
(SHAKILY) I can't do that.

01:18:12.767 --> 01:18:15.679
You tell them what you've done.

01:18:18.487 --> 01:18:20.239
Do it!

01:18:22.367 --> 01:18:24.198
This isn't gonna bring Martin back.

and have any symptoms of infection,

01:19:25.647 --> 01:19:27.797
we have an antiviral vaccine.

Now you believe me, that is lies.

01:19:31.127 --> 01:19:33.595
They want you to hear that!
That's not true!

01:19:33.767 --> 01:19:35.837
We have a vaccine.

01:19:36.007 --> 01:19:38.316
No, Kate...

01:19:39.007 --> 01:19:42.682
- Martin could have been saved.
- No. There is no vaccine for this.

01:19:42.847 --> 01:19:44.963
They didn't even know what it is I have!

01:19:45.127 --> 01:19:48.642
They just want to know where we are
so they can come and kill us both!
