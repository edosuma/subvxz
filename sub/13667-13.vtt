00:02.836 --> 00:05.583
<i>- Previously on St. Elsewhere.
- This boy's dead and gone.</i>

00:05.650 --> 00:10.875
- He's not dead
till I say he's dead.
- I'm here for a sex change.

00:10.942 --> 00:14.345
- [ guffaws ]
- Do you remember what happened
the night you were shot?

00:14.412 --> 00:16.113
I don't even remember
being shot.

00:16.180 --> 00:19.317
- You have no right
to tamper with my life.
- Who am I?

00:19.383 --> 00:22.253
<i>- I don't know.
- Tonight on st. Elsewhere.</i>

00:22.320 --> 00:24.255
No, Peter.
Come here.

00:24.322 --> 00:26.724
Don't, Peter, don't.
Why not?

00:26.791 --> 00:28.993
[ sighs ]
I just don't want it
right now.

00:29.060 --> 00:31.896
I really got interested
in it when I was a woman.

00:31.963 --> 00:34.231
When you were a woman?

00:34.298 --> 00:38.235
Mark, al and I
are lovers.

00:38.302 --> 00:42.239
Any operations to the head,
nose, ears, throat?

00:42.306 --> 00:44.675
No.
Do you pick your nose?

00:44.742 --> 00:48.346
Just enough
to keep it respectable.

00:48.412 --> 00:51.082
<i>He's my son!
Let me go!
Take him out of there!</i>

00:51.148 --> 00:54.485
<i>Keep him away from me!
 Keep him away from me!
Okay, settle down.</i>

02:33.618 --> 02:36.621
Well, today's the day.
Your anniversary?

02:38.856 --> 02:41.058
Bob overland,
Sex change operation.

02:43.694 --> 02:47.331
You're gonna have to
get over this. You're gonna
give yourself an ulcer.

02:47.398 --> 02:51.602
Last night, Ellen and I
discussed it for hours.
Didn't do any good.

02:51.669 --> 02:54.272
I seem to be the only one
that feels this way.

02:54.338 --> 02:56.707
Mark, why don't you go talk
to Hugh Beale?

02:56.774 --> 02:59.977
I talked to Beale
about talking to Bob.

03:00.044 --> 03:02.346
I'm not the crazy one.

03:08.085 --> 03:11.822
Oh, mark.
Uh, I was hoping
if you had a few moments,

03:11.889 --> 03:13.824
we could--
We could talk.

03:17.762 --> 03:19.864
You're busy.

03:19.930 --> 03:22.600
No, that's all right.

03:22.667 --> 03:24.702
What's the problem?

03:24.769 --> 03:27.638
Worried about the operation?
No, not at all.

03:29.240 --> 03:32.009
How do you feel?
I feel confident,
Good.

03:32.076 --> 03:35.212
Except for the fact
that you've been
avoiding me.

03:38.582 --> 03:42.820
Well, I have to tell you, Bob,
as much as I've tried,
I can't come to terms with this.

03:42.887 --> 03:46.524
I think you're making a terrible
mistake, and you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

03:49.694 --> 03:51.796
Well, at least, uh--

03:51.862 --> 03:55.466
at least it would be
my life, huh?

04:07.511 --> 04:11.182
Well,
I hope someday, mark,
that we can talk--

04:11.248 --> 04:14.118
You know, there's--

04:14.185 --> 04:17.788
There's one thing
that you can't do,

04:17.855 --> 04:21.858
and that's to make
new old friends.

04:21.926 --> 04:25.763
<i>They're a lot
like hearts, mark.</i>

04:25.830 --> 04:27.765
<i>It's not that easy
to replace them.</i>

04:27.832 --> 04:29.567
Hmm?

04:41.779 --> 04:43.848
Good Morning.
Hiya, Dr. Chandler.

04:43.914 --> 04:46.651
You hear anything lately
from the police?
They find who shot me?

04:46.717 --> 04:50.054
No, no leads yet.
Given any more thought
to what Sterling means?

04:50.121 --> 04:53.991
"No, no leads yet."
Your parents will be here
in a little while.

04:54.058 --> 04:56.861
What'd you say my name was?
David Steward?

04:56.927 --> 04:58.863
Yes.
I don't like it.

04:58.929 --> 05:01.132
I've gotten used to
John Doe number 12.

05:01.198 --> 05:05.202
Listen. I've seen pictures,
fingerprints, blood type--
Everything matches.

05:05.269 --> 05:08.639
You are David Steward
from port dalhousie
in Ontario, Canada.

05:08.706 --> 05:10.641
And these people
are your parents.

05:10.708 --> 05:13.077
I believe you,
it's just that--
what?

05:15.880 --> 05:17.815
I prayed last night that
a Miracle would happen.

05:17.882 --> 05:20.785
That somehow when I see them,
it will all Click into place.

05:20.851 --> 05:24.689
The Miracle
is that you're still alive.

05:24.755 --> 05:26.958
Now everything else is
gonna be a long, slow ride.

05:27.024 --> 05:30.494
I know.
When they get here,
I'll be ready.

05:36.233 --> 05:39.570
You see him, man?
No, I-I don't.

05:39.637 --> 05:42.440
Well, keep lookin', man.
He's in there.

05:42.506 --> 05:47.545
No, Mr. Singer, I'm sorry.
You have everything else
in your ear but an ant.

05:47.612 --> 05:49.513
When's the last time
you used a washcloth?

05:52.116 --> 05:55.353
Pete, your wife's
on the phone.

05:55.419 --> 05:57.355
I'll be right there.
Okay.

05:57.421 --> 06:00.424
Now don't do that.

06:00.491 --> 06:02.426
It's raw enough
in there already.

06:10.568 --> 06:13.337
Hello.

06:13.404 --> 06:15.539
Yeah, Yeah.

06:15.606 --> 06:18.509
No, no, no, that's okay.
That's okay.

06:18.576 --> 06:22.280
Yeah, he told me.
It's just that I was
working late, you know,

06:22.346 --> 06:25.850
and I thought it would be
too late to call you
when I got off.

06:27.218 --> 06:29.120
Yeah?

06:31.222 --> 06:35.526
Yeah, listen.
I've been thinking
the same thing myself.

06:35.593 --> 06:39.063
And, uh-- Mm-Hmm.

06:40.898 --> 06:44.669
Okay, uh-- okay,
I can get an hour off
this afternoon sometime.

06:44.735 --> 06:46.771
If that's, you know--

06:46.837 --> 06:49.674
Yeah. About 2:00.

06:49.740 --> 06:51.842
Okay, that sounds
real Good.

06:51.909 --> 06:56.180
Okey-Dokey.
All right. Bye-Bye.

06:56.247 --> 06:59.717
[ Clears Throat ]
that was Myra.

07:03.154 --> 07:07.091
I gotta go over there
to pick up a few things.

07:07.158 --> 07:11.929
I mean, I got, like,
two pair of socks
and three shirts.

07:11.996 --> 07:14.665
<i>[ siren wailing in distance ]
it's ridiculous, you know.</i>

07:20.304 --> 07:22.239
I gotta get back in there.

07:24.342 --> 07:27.144
<i>[ woman on P.A. ]
Mrs. Weller, please report
to your room.</i>

07:27.211 --> 07:29.513
<i>Mrs. Weller, to your room.</i>

07:35.286 --> 07:37.188
Okay, let's see how it is.

07:45.396 --> 07:47.331
Oh, there's still a little.

07:47.398 --> 07:49.333
So, I'll bleed to death.

07:49.400 --> 07:52.837
Mr. Heller,
in the great majority of cases,
the bleeding contains itself.

07:52.903 --> 07:54.872
So tell my Corpuscles.

07:54.939 --> 07:57.942
It's never been
this bad before?
Has it ever been this bad?

07:58.009 --> 08:01.379
Will you make it stop
already?

08:01.445 --> 08:05.383
How's your general health?
Okay?
Okay? I'm 77 years old.

08:05.449 --> 08:09.887
I pee too much.
I sleep too little.
What's okay?

08:09.954 --> 08:11.956
Any recent
sudden weight loss?

08:12.023 --> 08:15.092
I have been a contractor
for 51 years,

08:15.159 --> 08:18.129
and I have never lost
one day to a nosebleed.

08:18.195 --> 08:22.300
Now Let's get with it,
or find somebody who can.

08:24.268 --> 08:26.904
I'm sorry.

08:26.971 --> 08:30.174
Ever since I come in here,
I've been gripin' and bleedin'.

08:31.709 --> 08:34.211
I just have no energy.

08:34.278 --> 08:38.182
I don't even
have enough to make
a dirty-Old-Man pass at you.

08:40.083 --> 08:43.788
Any operations to the head,
nose, ears, throat?

08:43.854 --> 08:46.123
No.
Do you pick your nose?

08:46.190 --> 08:49.527
Just enough to keep it
respectable.

08:51.629 --> 08:53.731
What kind of contracting?

08:53.798 --> 08:59.203
Oh, uh, remodeling.
You know, adding on.
I like to use my hands.

08:59.270 --> 09:03.074
Anything a plumber,
an electrician or a Mason
can do, I can do myself.

09:03.140 --> 09:06.477
I still spend
a couple hours a week
helping out my kid.

09:06.544 --> 09:10.381
My Kid.
He's 53 years old.

09:10.448 --> 09:13.050
That's terrific.

09:13.117 --> 09:15.486
Yeah, all I do now
is walk around the house...

09:15.553 --> 09:20.725
and leave a Trail
of blood behind me,
like a snail.

09:20.791 --> 09:22.893
Well, Mr. Heller,
this may be nothing at all.

09:22.960 --> 09:26.163
The only way
we can find out for sure
is to run some tests on you.

09:26.230 --> 09:28.599
Is that okay?
Oh, sure, Sure.

09:28.666 --> 09:30.901
We're gonna find out
what's in there, huh?
Right.

09:33.337 --> 09:36.607
Two weeks ago,
your son was admitted
to the emergency room.

09:36.674 --> 09:39.010
Now, he'd had been shot here
with a hollow-Point bullet,

09:39.076 --> 09:41.212
which splintered
through his body.

09:41.279 --> 09:44.382
Now, his heart Stopped.
His left lung collapsed.

09:44.448 --> 09:49.086
He lost an enormous amount
of blood which cut off
the oxygen supply to his brain.

09:49.153 --> 09:54.792
Now, the bullet holes
in his heart, liver
and left Kidney were sutured.

09:54.859 --> 09:56.794
We had to remove
his spleen.

09:56.861 --> 09:58.929
And we put in
a temporary colostomy.

09:58.996 --> 10:01.599
Clinically,
he was dead.

10:01.666 --> 10:06.570
My god, I had no idea
of the extent of his injuries.

10:06.637 --> 10:08.839
Michael, please,
sit down.

10:08.906 --> 10:12.243
But you said he's
going to be all right.

10:12.310 --> 10:14.779
Yes. Yes, he is.
The reason I'm telling you
all this...

10:14.845 --> 10:18.482
is so that you'll understand
what a trauma your boy
has been through...

10:18.549 --> 10:21.619
and what a remarkable
recovery he's made.

10:21.686 --> 10:24.722
<i>[ knocking ]
yes, come in.</i>

10:24.789 --> 10:27.191
Ah, Dr. Chandler.
Mr. And Mrs. Steward.

10:27.258 --> 10:30.194
Dr. Chandler-- He's been
in charge of David's case
since he left surgery.

10:30.261 --> 10:32.763
Oh. How do you do?
How are you?
Mr. Steward.

10:32.830 --> 10:35.766
Hello. How's he doing?
Oh, very well,
considering.

10:35.833 --> 10:37.768
He's a great kid.

10:37.835 --> 10:41.205
The major problem,
as you know, is he suffered
a complete loss of memory...

10:41.272 --> 10:43.474
of everything
prior to his waking up
here at the hospital.

10:43.541 --> 10:48.346
How long will it be
before my son is cured
of this amnesia?

10:48.412 --> 10:51.849
Well, Mr. Steward,
I think we should tell you
that, uh,

10:51.916 --> 10:54.151
<i>David may Never
recover his memory.</i>

10:54.218 --> 10:58.255
Or if he does, it may
be just a partial recovery.
We don't know.

10:58.322 --> 11:01.459
But we are working
together every day
to try and get it back.

11:01.525 --> 11:03.260
I see.

11:03.327 --> 11:06.464
I think you should know
that the entire hospital
is behind David.

11:06.530 --> 11:08.633
We all feel we have
a personal stake in him.

11:08.699 --> 11:12.136
<i>He's a tremendous kid,
and we're doing everything
that we can.</i>

11:12.203 --> 11:15.940
I know this is
an awful lot of information
to absorb so quickly,

11:16.007 --> 11:18.509
so if you wanna just think
about things before
you go see David--

11:18.576 --> 11:22.513
He's been gone 13 months.
It's a long time.

11:22.580 --> 11:25.716
<i>I don't wanna
wait any longer.
Right.</i>

11:25.783 --> 11:27.551
I'll show you the way.

11:27.618 --> 11:30.655
Now, if there's anything
you wanna know about
his medical care,

11:30.721 --> 11:33.424
or if there's anything at all
I can do for you,
please let me know.

11:33.491 --> 11:36.294
Thank you very much,
Doctor.

11:36.360 --> 11:38.262
Thank you.
Certainly.

11:45.469 --> 11:49.006
Dr. Chandler, are you aware
that I'm David's stepmother?

11:49.073 --> 11:51.676
Yes. I read that
in the police report.

11:51.742 --> 11:55.379
Lizzie, David's mother,
died about four years ago.

11:55.446 --> 11:57.915
Of what?
Botulism.

11:59.417 --> 12:01.452
Well, we're
right in here.

12:01.519 --> 12:06.257
Michael and I
were married nine months
after Lizzie's death.

12:06.324 --> 12:09.894
I don't think David
Fully accepted
Our marriage ever.

12:09.961 --> 12:12.930
As a matter of fact,
I think he thought
that we betrayed his mother.

12:12.997 --> 12:15.666
That's not True.
Not True.

12:15.733 --> 12:19.170
We've talked about this before.
I don't think he has
any problem with that.

12:19.236 --> 12:21.172
All right.
Maybe you're right.

12:21.238 --> 12:24.442
Maybe it's just a feeling
that I have.

12:24.508 --> 12:26.444
David's always been
very sweet to me.

12:26.510 --> 12:30.748
It's just--
Well, his mother's death
was quite a blow to him.

12:30.815 --> 12:33.384
And to me too.
We were great friends.

12:35.553 --> 12:39.590
Well, um, while David
was in deep relaxation,

12:39.657 --> 12:41.926
he remembered
one WORD: Sterling.

12:41.993 --> 12:44.462
Does that mean anything
to either one of you?

12:44.528 --> 12:48.032
- No. Kate?
- Sterling? No.

12:48.099 --> 12:52.236
Well, if anything comes to mind,
no matter how insignificant,
please let me know.

12:52.303 --> 12:54.872
<i>[ Michael ]
All right.
I'll go get David.</i>

12:54.939 --> 12:59.710
Oh, by the way,
don't expect him
to recognize you right off.

12:59.777 --> 13:01.712
Don't push too fast.
Go easy.

13:01.779 --> 13:05.283
<i>He's still
very disoriented, weak
and still Traumatized.</i>

13:05.349 --> 13:07.251
- We understand.
- Good.

13:19.130 --> 13:21.032
That's him.

13:31.842 --> 13:34.378
Can I?
Sure.
Go right ahead.

13:40.584 --> 13:44.822
[ chuckles ]
you look fine.
How do you feel?

13:44.889 --> 13:46.824
When they told me
what you've been through--

13:50.828 --> 13:53.130
Hello, David.

13:54.899 --> 13:56.834
I don't know you,
you know.

13:56.901 --> 13:59.470
I told you it would take
some time, David.

13:59.537 --> 14:02.239
Come on, come on.
We've got a lot
to talk about.

14:02.306 --> 14:04.642
Yes, well, I'll see you
in a little while.
Dr. Chandler.

14:04.709 --> 14:07.745
Yes, David.
When am I due
in physical therapy?

14:07.812 --> 14:11.816
Not for a couple of hours.
You take all the time you want.

14:15.886 --> 14:17.822
Dr. Westphall?
Can I have a second?

14:17.888 --> 14:21.025
Sure. Come on in.

14:21.092 --> 14:25.529
I've got a patient in the E.R.--
chronic nosebleeder-- but I
can't find anything to treat.

14:25.596 --> 14:28.032
What's
the platelet count?
Adequate, 250,000.

14:28.099 --> 14:30.034
The function
is near 100%.

14:30.101 --> 14:32.536
Did you order
a coagulation profile?

14:32.603 --> 14:36.040
It showed a p.T./P.P.T.
Less than one point off
the standard control.

14:36.107 --> 14:39.043
I also did a blood smear.
Normal differential.

14:39.110 --> 14:41.812
The cells were mature,
normal in shape, size and Color.

14:41.879 --> 14:44.582
Hmm.
That's interesting,
isn't it?

14:44.649 --> 14:46.951
What about his family?
He's a widower.

14:47.018 --> 14:50.121
No, no, I mean
any of his relatives
have the same complaint?

14:50.187 --> 14:52.490
I don't know.
Why don't you know?

14:52.556 --> 14:54.492
I didn't check.

14:54.558 --> 14:58.095
<i>Wendy, diagnosis is less
of a Gamble if you start
at the beginning.</i>

14:58.162 --> 15:00.831
<i>You didn't take
an adequate history, right?
I thought I did.</i>

15:00.898 --> 15:02.833
You should know by now...

15:02.900 --> 15:05.903
how important it is
to get a complete
family medical history.

15:05.970 --> 15:09.573
You ask him: Mother and father
Alive or dead? If they're dead,
what did they die of?

15:09.640 --> 15:14.345
<i>Brothers and sisters--
Did any of them die?
Also, why? Of what?</i>

15:14.412 --> 15:16.714
<i>You've got to delve
into this thing
as far as you have to go.</i>

15:16.781 --> 15:20.184
Well, I used what we had on him.
He wasn't my patient the first
time he came in.

15:20.251 --> 15:23.621
Well, that's just fine.
Why don't you tell him that?
I'm sure he'll understand.

15:23.688 --> 15:26.123
But I suggest
you get that history
and work from it.

15:26.190 --> 15:30.294
<i>Otherwise both you
and your patient are in for
a pretty rough time, right?</i>

15:30.361 --> 15:32.596
Right.

15:37.501 --> 15:40.571
<i>[ Beale ] I'm preparing
for a lecture that I'm doing
tomorrow at harvard...</i>

15:40.638 --> 15:45.676
<i>for some young medical students
who are thinking about
going into psychiatry.</i>

15:45.743 --> 15:51.148
<i>You see, the whole idea
is to get a fix on the
hypnagogic Hallucinations.</i>

15:51.215 --> 15:56.287
Look, look, you see?
Each one of these
represents the last image...

15:56.354 --> 15:58.823
that some prisoners
at walpole Correctional had...

15:58.889 --> 16:01.993
just before they fell asleep
each night.

16:02.059 --> 16:04.195
Oh, that's interesting, Hugh.
Yeah.

16:04.261 --> 16:07.131
But all I wanna know is
did you talk to Bob overland?

16:07.198 --> 16:09.667
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I did.

16:09.734 --> 16:12.169
He's feeling fragged, right?

16:12.236 --> 16:16.007
It's a midlife crisis.
Does he think he's the only one?

16:16.073 --> 16:19.977
In my opinion, Bob is
handling the situation
very Well.

16:20.044 --> 16:24.115
[ scoffs ]
I think you're the one
with the problem, mark.

16:24.181 --> 16:27.718
Me?
Yeah.

16:27.785 --> 16:30.154
I do not have a problem.

16:30.221 --> 16:32.623
You and Bob
are very old friends.

16:32.690 --> 16:35.826
You have
similar backgrounds,
similar families,

16:35.893 --> 16:39.196
similar educations,
similar mind-Sets.

16:39.263 --> 16:42.199
But I'm not about
to get my thing cut off.

16:42.266 --> 16:44.702
There is
that one difference, yes.

16:44.769 --> 16:48.239
I think you have to admit,
however, that what he's doing
takes a whole lot of Courage.

16:48.306 --> 16:51.842
Yes, I admit that.
Bob's always had
a lot of courage,

16:51.909 --> 16:55.146
integrity, strength.

16:55.212 --> 16:58.349
Like those guys up THERE:
Daniel Boone,

16:58.416 --> 17:02.353
natty bumppo, hawkeye.

17:02.420 --> 17:06.123
What the hell am I talking
about? Will you turn
this damn thing off?

17:06.190 --> 17:08.425
I'm trying to have
an intelligent conversation,

17:08.492 --> 17:10.761
and you keep showing me
these stupid slides.

17:10.828 --> 17:13.464
All right.
All right.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.433
Look.

17:17.233 --> 17:21.071
Bob is one of your oldest
and best friends.

17:21.137 --> 17:25.041
You want what's best in life
for him, what'll bring him
happiness, right?

17:25.108 --> 17:27.811
Of course.
All right.

17:27.877 --> 17:33.818
Then try and separate.
Just try and separate
the two Facts.

17:33.884 --> 17:39.290
Number one:
You are personally
offended by this operation.

17:39.357 --> 17:41.592
Now that is a fact.

17:41.659 --> 17:44.128
Number Two:

17:44.195 --> 17:46.797
Bob has lived
his whole life as a man,

17:46.864 --> 17:49.233
and it has not
brought him happiness.

17:49.300 --> 17:51.202
This may just
do it for him.

17:54.171 --> 17:56.073
Separate the two?

17:58.943 --> 18:01.412
So, we were raised
with Three different cultures.

18:01.479 --> 18:05.516
We spoke yiddish at home.
German, we knew.
And american, right?

18:05.583 --> 18:07.985
Does anyone else
in your family
have nosebleeds?

18:08.052 --> 18:10.221
Sure.
Yes?

18:10.288 --> 18:12.223
Doesn't everybody
have nosebleeds?

18:12.290 --> 18:15.192
Many people do,
but not everybody does.

18:15.259 --> 18:19.196
Oh. Yeah,
my grandpa Nathan.

18:19.263 --> 18:21.232
That was my mother's father.

18:21.299 --> 18:23.467
I remember him
with a big handkerchief,

18:23.534 --> 18:26.103
holding it over his face
and it was all bloody.

18:26.170 --> 18:30.574
We'd just got off
the boat from danzig.
I was five.

18:30.641 --> 18:33.544
What did the doctors have
to say about his condition?
Doctors?

18:33.611 --> 18:36.614
This is 1910,
Ellis island.
What doctors?

18:38.015 --> 18:40.184
We'll help you
to the wheelchair,
okay, Mr. Heller?

18:41.285 --> 18:43.454
Look, my legs are fine.
I can walk.

18:43.521 --> 18:47.258
It's my nose.
Believe me,
this will be much faster.

18:47.325 --> 18:51.896
[ groans ]
no, you know--

18:51.963 --> 18:56.000
now, you know,
that name Armstrong?

18:56.067 --> 18:58.369
What are you, chinese?

18:58.436 --> 19:00.338
Japanese.

19:02.573 --> 19:05.176
How did
your grandfather die?

19:05.242 --> 19:08.245
Oh, the dybbuk got him.

19:08.312 --> 19:11.682
Pardon?
The dybbuk.

19:11.749 --> 19:15.353
<i>Did you ever see
the exorcist?
Yes.</i>

19:15.419 --> 19:18.956
Well, the dybbuk
is a jewish demon.

19:19.023 --> 19:22.193
He ever gets ahold of you,
it's good-Bye, Charlie.

19:22.259 --> 19:25.963
Old grandpa Nathan--
He was sure
the dybbuk was after him.

19:26.030 --> 19:30.468
The dybbuk used to yell
and Holler in his ear
and squeeze his heart.

19:30.534 --> 19:35.473
And the dybbuk would turn around
so fast in his head,
make him fall down.

19:35.539 --> 19:38.442
One day,
he didn't get up again.

19:39.543 --> 19:41.946
He was sitting
on the can at the time.

19:42.013 --> 19:45.750
This isn't exactly
what I'm after.
I know that.

19:45.816 --> 19:49.253
He had an infection
of the inner ear.

19:49.320 --> 19:52.657
Well, now, let's talk
about your family.

Uh-Oh, it started again.
Let me see.

20:07.104 --> 20:09.173
I wanna know what
you're gonna do to help me.

20:09.240 --> 20:12.677
Tell me that.
Don't keep asking me
about dead people.

20:12.743 --> 20:15.246
Mr. Heller, these tests,
along with your family's
medical history,

20:15.313 --> 20:17.214
may give us the answer
to your problem.

20:21.319 --> 20:24.288
That guy you sent up
for delousing, Mr. Singer?

20:24.355 --> 20:27.091
He just pigeonholed me
for 45 minutes...

20:27.158 --> 20:30.761
on how his ears bleed
every August 28th
if it's Sunny.

20:30.828 --> 20:34.131
It's your basic ear fetish.
It's unbelievable.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.035
I'm seeing Myra today.

20:38.102 --> 20:41.172
Oh, really?
Well, she's been calling,
you know.

20:41.238 --> 20:44.775
And I figured now
is as good a time as any
to sit down and talk.

20:44.842 --> 20:46.777
Well, that's terrific,
Peter.

20:46.844 --> 20:49.614
Don't go readin' anything
more into this than is there.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.616
All we're gonna do
is sit down and talk.

20:51.682 --> 20:54.385
Well, it's a start,
right?

20:54.452 --> 20:58.889
Right?
I mean, reconciliations--
Possible reconciliations--

20:58.956 --> 21:02.093
Do usually begin
with a couple of sentences
thrown back and forth.

21:02.159 --> 21:04.862
Oh, is that how it works?
Yeah.

21:04.929 --> 21:07.365

to do with me.
Right. I think.

to tell him how I feel.

26:58.249 --> 27:00.584
There may be a connection.

27:00.651 --> 27:03.387

It's important for me,

Any alcoholics in the family?
No.

27:16.834 --> 27:21.238
[ sighs ]
Okay.

27:21.305 --> 27:25.543
After this, I wanna have them
do a liver/spleen scan
and get some liver enzymes.

27:28.646 --> 27:31.515
I'm sorry,
but we're looking for a zebra.

27:31.582 --> 27:34.418
A zebra?

27:34.485 --> 27:37.355
It's what we call a case that
we can't find an easy answer to.

27:37.421 --> 27:41.659
We start with a nosebleed
and now we're looking
for a zebra?

Friends are friends,
but they've got
their own lives too.

27:56.641 --> 27:59.043
I know.

27:59.110 --> 28:04.048
Well, so I was thinking
that, uh,

28:04.115 --> 28:08.419
we should try it again...
just for a little bit.

28:08.486 --> 28:10.788
And maybe we can
work things out.

28:16.761 --> 28:18.929
God, you look good.
You do.

28:18.996 --> 28:20.898
Thank you.

28:30.541 --> 28:32.710
No, Peter.
Come here.

28:32.777 --> 28:35.346
Don't, Peter, don't.
Why not?

28:35.413 --> 28:37.782
[ sighs ]
I just don't
want it right now.

28:40.718 --> 28:43.387
I feel relaxed
and I'm content,

28:43.454 --> 28:45.589
and I just don't
want it right now.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.429
Why did you ask me
to come over here today?

28:51.495 --> 28:54.198
<i>[ dog barking in distance ]</i>

28:56.767 --> 28:59.136

29:04.909 --> 29:08.746
That's what you got

It's not enough.

Look, Myra,
I make $18,000 a year.

29:14.018 --> 29:15.987
After rent, taxes
and student loans,

29:16.053 --> 29:18.289
that leaves $600 a month.

29:18.356 --> 29:21.559
You get $400 of that.
It's not enough.

29:21.626 --> 29:24.028
It's all there is.

29:24.095 --> 29:25.997
I promise you.

29:32.103 --> 29:35.940
Look, Peter,
I'm not trying to kill you.
I'm really not.

29:37.308 --> 29:39.510
You should have married

29:46.751 --> 29:49.120
Well, as long as I'm here,

29:49.186 --> 29:51.789
I guess I'll go upstairs
and get my things.

Settle Down.
What's going on?
I don't know.

30:09.040 --> 30:11.242
It started out
as a nice father and son chat.

30:11.309 --> 30:14.478
All right, it's over.
Okay. Okay. Okay.

30:14.545 --> 30:16.781
Okay.

30:19.417 --> 30:22.086
<i>Get out!

30:22.153 --> 30:24.822
I thought we agreed--
you can't keep me
from seeing my son.

30:24.889 --> 30:28.859
I had to talk to him
to remind him of things
only he and I know about.

30:28.926 --> 30:31.629
<i>Get away from me!
Keep him away from me!
I thought--</i>

30:31.696 --> 30:34.031
I thought maybe
he'd remember me then.

Well, you see
what you've done now?

30:38.970 --> 30:41.372
I'm sorry.

30:41.439 --> 30:44.709
Look, please,

leave me alone?

30:59.824 --> 31:03.260
He's gone now.
He won't be back.

31:03.327 --> 31:07.231
Let's get something
to calm him down.
Diazepam 10 milligrams, I.M.

31:07.298 --> 31:09.300
I knew it.
I knew it.

31:09.367 --> 31:12.903
I shouldn't have let myself
hope that I'd remember them
as soon as I saw their faces.

31:12.970 --> 31:15.139
Why did you let me hope?

31:15.206 --> 31:19.243
Why didn't you let me die?
Why didn't you just leave me
on the street?

31:21.379 --> 31:24.749
I wanna die.
No, you don't.

31:24.815 --> 31:29.487
Now, if you wanted to die,
you would have checked out
in E.R. Two weeks ago.

31:29.553 --> 31:31.489
Now, you have
an incredible will to live...

31:31.555 --> 31:33.491
and a heart to match it,
beat by Beat.

31:33.557 --> 31:37.495
Samuels told me when you were
in E.R., he grabbed you by the
heart, he knew you wouldn't die.

31:37.561 --> 31:41.732
"The heart of a lion,"
he said. Now, come on.
You're gonna make it.

Hello again.

had open-Heart surgery.

32:02.286 --> 32:06.424
He had to--
This thing was all
your idea, wasn't it?

32:06.490 --> 32:09.760
Hardly.
You should have left
Well enough alone.

32:11.128 --> 32:13.064
When I first met Bob
four years ago,

32:13.130 --> 32:16.000
he had everything that was
supposed to make him happy.

32:16.067 --> 32:18.069
And nobody knew
who he was.

32:18.135 --> 32:20.805
Not his family,
not his friends,
not himself.

32:20.871 --> 32:23.441
I don't wanna hear all this.
I think you need to.

32:23.507 --> 32:25.443
We're talking about a man
who tortured himself,

32:25.509 --> 32:27.445
knowing that
he had to make love
with his wife.

32:27.511 --> 32:29.914
He loved Anne.
He tried to.

32:29.981 --> 32:32.483
He tried to live
the kind of life
you'd want him to.

32:32.550 --> 32:38.122
But he's decided
he can't live a lie anymore,
and it's cost him.

32:38.189 --> 32:40.992
[ Scoffs ] as soon as
his company found out about it,
they fired him.

32:41.058 --> 32:42.994

32:43.060 --> 32:47.465
His friends discreetly
disappeared. One son
won't talk to him at all.

32:47.531 --> 32:50.434
When the other one does,
it's to make a verbal attack.
He's lost everything.

32:50.501 --> 32:55.940
And all he wanted from you
was a little understanding.

32:56.007 --> 33:00.044
For whatever reason,
he needed it. You could
have given it to him.

33:00.111 --> 33:02.480
It wouldn't have
cost you a thing.

33:03.981 --> 33:08.753
You really should have,
you know, for old times' sake.

33:09.987 --> 33:11.956
It was nice to
meet you, Dr. Craig.

33:25.336 --> 33:29.173

it'll be gone in five days.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.342

33:33.411 --> 33:35.980

Your conscious self knows
that you're doing the best
you can to treat this boy.

36:04.295 --> 36:07.932
But the subconscious?
Ah, the subconscious
is like a computer.

36:07.999 --> 36:12.837
It can't make judgments
about right or wrong.
It just stores facts.

36:12.903 --> 36:15.973
And the fact is...

36:16.040 --> 36:18.409
that no matter
how hard it gets,

David Steward is trying

36:24.181 --> 36:26.984
Yeah.
That's pretty good, Beale.

36:27.051 --> 36:28.986

I might have some information

I don't know if it's too
valuable, but you did say
to let you know anything,

no matter how insignificant
it might be.

37:02.720 --> 37:06.090
Yes, please, go ahead.
Well, I talked
to David's grandmother,

37:06.157 --> 37:09.360
and it seems that
when David was about 10 or 11,

37:09.427 --> 37:12.930
he bought his mother
a Sterling silver
St. Christopher Medal.

37:12.997 --> 37:15.166
Well, was that
a big thing to him?
It was.

37:15.232 --> 37:18.803
It seems that he worked
at the corner grocery store
for about a month,

37:18.869 --> 37:21.539
just running errands
so that he'd have enough
money to pay for it.

37:21.606 --> 37:24.241
What happened to it?
After his mother died,

37:24.308 --> 37:27.545
Michael gave it back to him
so that he could have it
as a keepsake.

37:27.612 --> 37:32.249
Oh, okay. Well, thank you.
Thank you. Maybe that'll help.

37:37.955 --> 37:40.458
Get up.

37:40.524 --> 37:44.495
Wake up. I gotta ask you
a few questions.
I'm tired.

37:44.562 --> 37:46.731
Look, you slept all afternoon.
You missed physical Therapy.

37:46.797 --> 37:48.866
Come on, let's go.
It's that drug
you gave me.

37:48.933 --> 37:51.569

Low-Dose sedatives
don't make you that sleepy.

37:55.273 --> 37:58.042
Okay. Now.

38:00.177 --> 38:04.382
You bought your mother
a Sterling silver
St. Christopher medal.

38:04.448 --> 38:07.618
And when she died,
your father gave it back
to you. Do you remember?

38:07.685 --> 38:10.921
Nope.
Try. It was five
or six years ago.

38:10.988 --> 38:13.891
You saved up the money
by getting a job
at a local grocery store.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.893
Sorry, I can't.
Think.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.328
I am.
No, you're not.

38:17.395 --> 38:19.764
I said I can't remember.
You're not trying.

38:19.830 --> 38:23.100
Think. Try. Remember.
Talk, talk, talk.

38:23.167 --> 38:25.569
I'm tired of it.
I've had enough.
Just concentrate.

38:25.636 --> 38:27.939
I'm tired of it!

38:28.005 --> 38:30.775
Look, David,
I can't help you
if you won't let me.

38:30.841 --> 38:33.044
I don't want your help.
It won't do any good.

38:33.110 --> 38:36.614
I'm gonna be this way forever,
so stop wasting your time, okay?

38:40.384 --> 38:42.787
I know what's wrong
with Mr. Heller.

38:42.853 --> 38:46.324
Heller?
Oh, the nosebleed?
Gaucher's disease.

38:46.390 --> 38:49.860
Go-Shay's.
Yeah.

38:49.927 --> 38:54.465
Well, you've gone
from a basic nosebleed
to a rare, chronic disease.

38:54.532 --> 38:59.470
One of probably 30 possibilities
for a bleeding disorder
and Splenomegaly.

38:59.537 --> 39:03.541
Listen. This is Arnold toynbee
on the migration
of the ashkenazim.

39:03.608 --> 39:07.111
Toynbee? The historian?
"The latter day
jewish herodians...

39:07.178 --> 39:09.547
"Seized the opportunity that
western liberalism offered,

39:09.614 --> 39:11.649
by carrying forward
the policy of assimilation."

39:11.716 --> 39:13.818
If you're gonna tell me
that gaucher's...

39:13.884 --> 39:17.588
is as common among
the ashkenazim as tay-Sachs,
I already know it.

39:17.655 --> 39:20.725
Now, Wendy, I think
your speculation
is very interesting.

39:20.791 --> 39:23.794

a glucocerebrosidase.

39:38.609 --> 39:40.678
That's
a very expensive test.

39:40.745 --> 39:42.580
It's the only way
I'll find out for sure.

39:42.647 --> 39:45.383
<i>It costs $250.
I realize that.</i>

39:45.449 --> 39:48.486
You do? Well, then
why don't you go ahead
and try it.

40:06.871 --> 40:10.007
- [ knocking ]
- What can I do for you?

40:10.074 --> 40:12.843
I do wanna Remember.

40:28.326 --> 40:31.062
Hi, Bob.
Mm.

40:31.128 --> 40:33.264
Oh, mark.
Shh.

40:34.432 --> 40:36.500
You were right,
you know.

40:36.567 --> 40:38.803
You can't make
new old friends.

40:41.405 --> 40:44.108
You're a good person, Bob.

40:44.175 --> 40:47.912
You always were,
and I know you always will be.

40:49.347 --> 40:53.451
So, I just
wanted to say, um,
good luck, Buddy.

41:25.816 --> 41:28.953
I don't know how...

41:29.020 --> 41:32.823
you can drink cold beer
when it is freezing outside.

41:32.890 --> 41:34.892
You know, it's gonna
get down to zero tonight?

41:34.959 --> 41:38.262
Yeah, I heard.
Why don't you put it
over here?

41:38.329 --> 41:40.264
I have an electric blanket
if you'd like.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.633
No, this is fine.

42:05.289 --> 42:07.892
I've always needed
someone like you.

42:10.494 --> 42:12.730
I've dreamed of someone
like you.

42:18.502 --> 42:20.438
When you went
to see Myra today--

42:20.504 --> 42:23.007
I just went to pick up
a few things.

42:29.447 --> 42:31.349
Feel my heart, Peter.

42:39.256 --> 42:41.158
Feel it.

42:47.665 --> 42:50.868
Valium and everything,
it still won't stop.

42:50.935 --> 42:55.506
Sandy, you have
nothing to worry about.

43:06.617 --> 43:08.519
Move in with me.

43:13.090 --> 43:15.893
I'll make you the happiest man
on the face of the earth.

43:19.930 --> 43:22.934
Please.
Come here.

43:26.671 --> 43:29.173
[ David ]
they said she was my mother.

43:29.240 --> 43:32.877
<i>[ Chandler ]
what do you say?
I think she was.</i>

43:33.978 --> 43:36.414
When I was supposedly dead,

43:36.480 --> 43:40.584
and I could see Fiscus
and the others working on me
in the emergency room?

43:40.651 --> 43:43.187
Yes?

43:43.254 --> 43:45.556
When I floated up
into the light,

43:47.224 --> 43:51.729
this is the woman
who held out her arms
and asked me if I was ready.

43:54.799 --> 43:58.002
Do you have
any other memories of her?

43:58.069 --> 44:00.204
<i>I've been trying to.
[ Elevator Bell Dings ]</i>

44:03.040 --> 44:05.309
look at the photograph.

44:07.178 --> 44:09.580
Concentrate on her face.

44:16.587 --> 44:18.556
Study it.

44:21.425 --> 44:23.394
Sit back, relax.

44:28.432 --> 44:30.635
See her face Smiling.

44:31.802 --> 44:33.804
Imagine the smile
getting wider and wider,

44:33.871 --> 44:37.241
until it breaks
into a laugh.

44:37.308 --> 44:40.344
Can you see her laughing?

44:40.411 --> 44:42.346
Yeah.
Okay.

44:42.413 --> 44:44.315
Good.

44:45.816 --> 44:48.719
Imagine yourself
in the photograph,

44:48.786 --> 44:51.255
Standing right next
to her, okay?

44:51.322 --> 44:53.524
And you're laughing too.

44:53.591 --> 44:58.863
You're sharing a joke together.
You're talking together.

45:00.898 --> 45:03.301
I see it.
Good.

45:04.368 --> 45:07.505
You take out
a brightly wrapped box,

45:07.571 --> 45:10.274
a gift for her.

45:10.341 --> 45:14.979
Imagine the color and design
of the wrapping paper.

45:15.046 --> 45:18.282
And a bow?
Oh, yeah, sure.
If you see it, yes.

45:19.317 --> 45:21.385
How big is the box?

45:21.452 --> 45:25.122
Well, it's not very big.
About, uh--

45:25.189 --> 45:29.493
<i>[ paper Rustling ]
about this big.</i>

45:29.560 --> 45:31.495
And you hand it
to her proudly.

45:31.562 --> 45:35.433
And she puts her arms
around you gratefully.

45:35.499 --> 45:38.369
But she hasn't
even opened it.

45:38.436 --> 45:43.207
Oh, she's-She's
happy to get it.

45:43.274 --> 45:45.710
It's a sign
of your love for her.

45:45.776 --> 45:48.412
And she loves you
very much.

45:50.548 --> 45:52.516
Open it.
Yes.

45:52.583 --> 45:57.722
Slowly she unfolds the bow,
pulls back the tape.

45:57.788 --> 46:01.392
See, she doesn't want to
mess up the wrapping paper.

46:01.459 --> 46:04.829
Takes out the little box.
Oh!

46:04.895 --> 46:08.633
She sees the name
of a jeweler on the top.

46:08.699 --> 46:11.102
Her eyes filled
with Expectation.

46:11.168 --> 46:15.306
She takes off the top,
looks inside.

46:15.373 --> 46:18.209
Great expectation
in her eyes.

46:19.977 --> 46:21.879
She pulls out this.

46:34.725 --> 46:37.662
<i>Scar.
Yes.</i>

46:40.798 --> 46:43.000
He had a scar.

46:43.067 --> 46:45.236
Who?

46:45.303 --> 46:48.406
The man.
The one who shot me.

46:48.472 --> 46:51.876
I-I--

46:51.943 --> 46:56.247
he took everything I had.

46:56.314 --> 47:00.818
I-I asked him,
I said,

47:00.885 --> 47:05.756
"Take my wallet, my watch,
but please leave me the medal."

47:12.863 --> 47:14.799
I remember.

47:19.303 --> 47:21.939
I remember the Scar.

47:27.545 --> 47:30.815
[ chuckling ]

47:33.784 --> 47:36.654
<i>[ knocking ]

47:37.722 --> 47:39.657
Dr. Westphall?
Uh-huh.

47:39.724 --> 47:42.460
The special chemistry lab
completed the enzyme test
on Mr. Heller.

47:42.526 --> 47:46.330
He's got a glucocerebrosidase
level of 220.
That's very high.

47:46.397 --> 47:50.034
Not if you've got
gaucher's disease.
True enough.

47:50.101 --> 47:54.572
I was right.
Well, I wouldn't be
so happy about it.

47:54.639 --> 47:57.375
It's a chronic disease
and you're still gonna
have to tell Mr. Heller...

47:57.441 --> 47:59.777
that he's gonna
require medication
for the rest of his life.

47:59.844 --> 48:03.214
But I found it. It took me
all day and all night,
but I found it.

48:03.281 --> 48:05.616
Maybe next time
you'll do what I tell you to do.

48:05.683 --> 48:07.785
What do you mean?
What I told
you this morning.

48:07.852 --> 48:11.555
Get a complete
family history.

48:11.622 --> 48:14.725
Good night,

Good night.
