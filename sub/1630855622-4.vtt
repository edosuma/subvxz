WEBVTT

00:06.589 --> 00:07.424
- [sighs]

00:07.465 --> 00:08.842
Hello.
- Hi.

00:08.883 --> 00:10.260
- Okay.

00:10.301 --> 00:13.138
[breathing heavily]

00:13.179 --> 00:15.140
Great to see you again.
- Yeah.

00:15.181 --> 00:17.225
- Okay, so there's
nothing to worry about.

00:17.267 --> 00:18.977
I think we make
an offer to Rodney

00:19.019 --> 00:20.353
and then see how he responds.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.188
And from there, we can--

00:22.230 --> 00:24.024
ah, shoot.

00:24.065 --> 00:25.650
Do either of you have a pen?

00:25.692 --> 00:28.987
- We prefer our lawyer
to have his own pen, but here.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.864
- Thank you.

00:30.905 --> 00:33.116
[sighs]

00:33.158 --> 00:35.952
[groans]
Oh, yeah.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.871
Oh!

00:37.912 --> 00:40.290
[moaning]

00:40.331 --> 00:42.042
[laughs]
It's orgasmic.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.877
- What happened to your wrist?

00:43.918 --> 00:46.379
- Well, I saw a beautiful woman
on the elevator,

00:46.421 --> 00:49.424
and I tried to force my way in.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.217
- Jillian, who did you hire?

00:51.259 --> 00:53.386
- Dean Trovia.
You've seen his billboards.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.555
Blackmail is his specialty.
- Yeah.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.682
It's one of the three pillars
of my practice.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.226
Dads' law, blackmail,
getting cops out of whoopsies.

01:00.268 --> 01:02.062
- Well, Rodney is
taking our farm,

01:02.103 --> 01:03.355
but we'd still like
to try to keep

01:03.396 --> 01:04.898
a minority ownership stake.

01:04.939 --> 01:08.193
- Also, it's named
Henry's Farm, after my dad.

01:08.234 --> 01:10.695
I'd love it if that could stay.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.490
- Wait, that--that's all?

01:13.531 --> 01:16.284
Guys, that's--that's nothing.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.370
You have all the leverage here.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.455
You should fucking destroy
this guy.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.707
- You do know we're the ones
being blackmailed, right,

01:22.749 --> 01:25.627
not the ones
doing the blackmail?

01:25.669 --> 01:27.337
- Oh, shit.

01:27.379 --> 01:29.172
Being blackmailed?

01:29.214 --> 01:30.590
Being blackmailed is the worst!

01:30.632 --> 01:31.925
- So then
this isn't your specialty?

01:31.966 --> 01:34.886
- No. No, it's not.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.429
My thing is that I have

01:36.471 --> 01:38.139
this really handsome
male friend.

01:38.181 --> 01:41.184
And I usually just film him
having sex with married women.

01:41.226 --> 01:42.936
I pay him in drugs.

01:42.977 --> 01:45.730
Uh...
[breathing heavily]

01:45.772 --> 01:48.066
It's okay. It's fine.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.484
It's fine.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.111
I'm a good lawyer, and...
[elevator dings]

01:51.152 --> 01:52.278
I know what to do.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.155
Now, if you'll excuse me,

01:54.197 --> 01:55.949
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.701
I'll be back in one second.

01:57.742 --> 01:59.327
- Why are you taking
your briefcase?

01:59.369 --> 02:01.287
- Hold the door. Hold the door.
- No, no. Hey, get back here!

02:01.329 --> 02:02.539
- Hold the door!

02:02.580 --> 02:04.207
[screams]

02:04.249 --> 02:05.750
Fuck!

02:05.792 --> 02:08.586
[bombastic music]

02:08.628 --> 02:10.964
- So we were hoping
we could stay on

02:11.006 --> 02:12.549
as minority stakeholders.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.467
- Since we did spend a year

02:14.509 --> 02:16.386
building the farm
from the ground up.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.138
- All right.
I'll tell you what I can do.

02:18.179 --> 02:20.473
Checkbook! All right.

02:20.515 --> 02:23.393
I'll pay you out, all right?

02:23.435 --> 02:25.061
You get a finder's fee.

02:25.103 --> 02:28.231
In exchange for providing me
with the saw palmetto farm,

02:28.273 --> 02:30.984
you receive...

02:31.026 --> 02:32.485
- A million bucks?

02:32.527 --> 02:34.070
- No, a--a million dicks.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.530
That says a million dicks.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.449
- It says bucks, right?
- It looks like bucks to me.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.159
- It says a million dicks.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.493
It's a joke.

02:40.535 --> 02:41.995
I'm not giving you anything.

02:42.037 --> 02:42.996
- Ask about the name.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.706
- The name?
- Yeah.

02:44.748 --> 02:47.959
I was hoping we could keep it
named after my father, Henry.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.837
It's just a tribute.
It won't cost you anything.

02:50.879 --> 02:51.921
- Hmm.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.842
- So that's a no.
- Yeah, it's a no.

02:55.884 --> 02:58.011
It's now called
Noah's Plantation,

02:58.053 --> 02:59.429
in honor of my dead stepson.

02:59.471 --> 03:00.847
- The one you killed?

03:00.889 --> 03:02.849
- I'm more troubled
by the plantation part.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.309
- Why?

03:04.351 --> 03:06.019
- I mean, Rodney--

03:06.061 --> 03:08.813
- Well, I guess that's it.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.523
Keys to the office
and the truck.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.442
- I assume you'll be
keeping Gabriel and Angel

03:12.484 --> 03:13.985
through harvest season.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.528
This is Gabriel's sunscreen.

03:15.570 --> 03:18.740
He always forgets to put it on.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.200
Oh. Okay.

03:20.241 --> 03:22.952
Well, this is Angel's EpiPen.

03:22.994 --> 03:26.081
- Ooh, shot of adrenaline
before a big negotiation?

03:26.122 --> 03:27.457
I'm gonna hang on to this shit.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.459
- So, Craigory,
Rodney needs somebody

03:29.501 --> 03:31.211
to manage this place,
so I convinced him

03:31.252 --> 03:32.712
to pay you two to stay on.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.214
- How much?
- Jillian!

03:34.255 --> 03:35.256
- How much you making before?

03:35.298 --> 03:37.842
- $35,000 a year before taxes.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.094
- [laughs]
- Jesus.

03:39.135 --> 03:40.929
That's grim. I'm sorry.

03:40.970 --> 03:42.931
I pay twice that
to Prada's sober companion,

03:42.972 --> 03:44.557
and all she has to do
is go to dinners.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.226
- We'll keep you at 35.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.103
How's that sound?

03:48.144 --> 03:51.064
[tense music]

03:51.106 --> 03:57.821
* *

03:57.862 --> 04:02.283
- Okay, just gonna break this
eye contact for a moment here.

04:04.703 --> 04:07.414
I mean, at least
he's not cutting our pay.

04:07.455 --> 04:09.791
We can still pay rent,
buy food.

04:09.833 --> 04:10.875
- Keep our Kias.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.502
- Yes, Craig,
I'd like to keep my Kia.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.129
- Well, I can't do it.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.463
Fuck Rodney.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.632
Double fuck Isaiah,
treacherous leech.

04:17.674 --> 04:20.051
- I mean, Isaiah convinced
Rodney to keep us on.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.928
That was nice of him, right?

04:21.970 --> 04:24.389
- Right.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.975
Isaiah's never nice.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.309
If he wants us to stay,

04:28.351 --> 04:30.854
it must mean
they really need us.

04:30.895 --> 04:32.397
Watch this.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.942
Okay, here's our counteroffer.

04:35.984 --> 04:39.112
We'll stay, but...

04:39.154 --> 04:40.947
we want $80,000 a year.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.407
- Wow.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.117
We're negotiating, huh?

04:44.159 --> 04:45.869
Okay.

04:45.910 --> 04:48.121
[screams] Whoo!
- The fuck?

04:48.163 --> 04:49.622
- My offer is this.

04:49.664 --> 04:50.707
Farming isn't hard.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.250
I can replace you
with a suck bot.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.626
You're fired.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.545
What about you, weirdo?
What do you say?

04:55.587 --> 04:58.590
35K, going once. Going twice...

04:58.631 --> 05:00.175
- It's okay if you're
gonna do it, Jillian.

05:00.216 --> 05:02.552
- 34K. 33K.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.137
- I'm in. I'll stay it 33.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.347
- All right, good.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.015
You got any problems,
call Isaiah.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.642
This is the last time
I set foot on a fucking farm.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.644
Look at my shoes.
They're ruined.

05:11.686 --> 05:14.022
Russell Crowe got me
these shoes as a gift.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.148
- I'm sorry.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.649
I shouldn't have said yes.
I panicked.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.401
I can still quit.
We're partners.

05:18.443 --> 05:19.486
I can't abandon you.

05:19.527 --> 05:20.653
- It's okay, Jillian.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.405
I've been unemployed before.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.115
I'll be fine.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.450
Hi.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.327
I applied for
the security guard position,

05:27.369 --> 05:29.537
and I wanted to follow up.

05:29.579 --> 05:32.040
Yes, Foster, right.

05:32.082 --> 05:35.710
[somber music]

05:35.752 --> 05:39.381
Okay, well, should I call back
in a couple of weeks, or--

05:40.840 --> 05:42.258
Okay.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.470
Well, thank you.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.389
- It's because you're too cute.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.182
Who'd be afraid of that face?

05:49.224 --> 05:50.392
- Thanks, Dolores.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.518
But the problem isn't
how cute I am.

05:51.559 --> 05:53.311
It's that nobody's hiring.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.021
Dolores, damn!

05:55.063 --> 05:56.856
We talked about this.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.566
The kitchen is a common area.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.652
You have to wear underwear
in the common areas.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.696
- The bathroom is
a common area,

06:02.737 --> 06:04.030
and I'm naked there.

06:04.072 --> 06:06.157
[phone buzzing]
Your rule makes no sense.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.450
- [laughs]

06:07.492 --> 06:08.993
Hey, baby, what's shaking?
- Hey, Daddy.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.453
Do you think you could
take me to Nina's later?

06:10.495 --> 06:12.414
- What? I thought
we were gonna hang out.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.874
I mean, when is your mom's
weird white baby due?

06:14.916 --> 06:16.292
How much longer
are you even in town?

06:16.334 --> 06:17.711
- Like, two more weeks.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.212
- You moved
across the country, Ness.

06:19.254 --> 06:20.547
I never get to see you.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.716
- Well, I never get to see
my friends either.

06:22.757 --> 06:25.093
Anyways, it's Mom's fault
for moving me to Oakland.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.636
- No. No, no, no, no, no.

06:26.678 --> 06:29.389
Don't try to make me mad
at Mom for your choices.

06:29.431 --> 06:30.890
But you make a good point.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.476
It was fucked up what she did.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.061
I'll see you in a bit.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.229
I'll take you to Nina's.

06:36.271 --> 06:37.397
- Thanks.

06:37.439 --> 06:41.526
* *

06:41.568 --> 06:43.611
Dolores!
- [groans]

06:43.653 --> 06:46.239
- Why you gotta put stuff
up high all the time?

06:46.281 --> 06:48.158
[knock at door]

06:48.199 --> 06:50.368
- It's open. Give me a sec.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.371
[steady music]

06:53.413 --> 06:57.000
* *

06:57.042 --> 06:58.752
- Dang.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.086
You guys got a suite?

07:00.128 --> 07:01.755
Ain't your Mom's job
at a nonprofit,

07:01.796 --> 07:03.840
'cause this looks like profit.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.383
- The couple is paying for it.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.093
- How come I've never heard
this couple's name?

07:07.135 --> 07:08.887
How come they're always
"the couple"?

07:08.928 --> 07:11.056
- 'Cause Mom signed an NDA,
so you can't know who they are.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.183
But any time
we have to go somewhere,

07:13.224 --> 07:14.392
they send a driver for us.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.518
- Camille.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.854
- [vocalizing]

07:20.148 --> 07:22.192
- Wait, aren't you going
to the baby shower?

07:22.233 --> 07:23.526
The couple is
throwing her a party.

07:23.568 --> 07:24.778
- Oh.

07:31.493 --> 07:33.203
- I can do it. Let me do it.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.163
I'll drop Nessa off,
then I'll come take you.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.460
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I mean, I'm so busy.

07:40.502 --> 07:41.586
But come on.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.588
You need me.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.131
Admit it.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.014
- Camille, I run
my own business.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.475
I'm the consummate
professional.

07:55.517 --> 07:58.478
[upbeat music playing]

07:58.520 --> 08:01.481
[chatter and laughter]

08:01.523 --> 08:08.655

08:11.533 --> 08:15.328
Holy crap, what the fuck's
their budget on this shit?

08:15.370 --> 08:17.622
You know my fear of white
people in coordinated outfits.

08:17.664 --> 08:18.915
This some cult shit.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.253
- [screams]
Cammy, you're here!

08:23.294 --> 08:25.255
I'm so glad you're here.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.965
- She said,
"Thank you for having me."

08:27.007 --> 08:28.925
- * I want to touch
my baby *

08:31.011 --> 08:32.595
Ope, nope.
You just dove right in there.

08:32.637 --> 08:35.557
- Hello, my baby.

08:35.598 --> 08:37.350
I don't feel him kicking.

08:37.392 --> 08:38.852
Why isn't he kicking?

08:38.893 --> 08:40.770
Are you playing the tapes
of my voice?

08:40.812 --> 08:42.188
He should be kicking.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.606
- Hey, I'm Tate.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.066
This is Blythe.
- Hey. Craig.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.735
- Thanks so much
for translating.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.445
I'll get you my assistant's
email for the invoice.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.446
- Oh, I don't need to be paid.

08:49.487 --> 08:50.530
Camille and I are friends.

08:50.572 --> 08:51.614
We were actually married.

08:51.656 --> 08:52.907
- Oh, hell yeah.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.451
We gotta get you a spring roll.
Leila!

08:54.492 --> 08:55.535
What's up, girl?

08:55.577 --> 08:56.536
- [gasps] He's kicking.

08:56.578 --> 08:57.912
My baby's kicking.

08:57.954 --> 09:00.040
Zeta? Zeta, come feel my baby.
- Ah! Oh, my God!

09:00.081 --> 09:01.666
- Uh-uh, let's get Camille's
permission first.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.084
- Excuse me.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.169
- No, sir, no.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.837
Do not put your hands
on my friend.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.797
- I was just saying--
- No, she's a woman.

09:07.839 --> 09:09.257
Okay? You're a man.

09:09.299 --> 09:10.717
- Ow.
- But she was just coming in.

09:10.759 --> 09:12.886
And I was just--
- No, strange man. Enough.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.596
Please, touch my baby.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.973
- Aww!
- I'm so sorry.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.516
I didn't expect you
to get assaulted

09:18.558 --> 09:20.560
at my frickin' party.

09:20.602 --> 09:22.771
- Okay, okay. Stop pushing.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.109
- I'm the only one
looking out for you.

09:28.151 --> 09:29.861
Obviously, these people aren't.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.113
Who has a all-sushi
baby shower?

09:32.155 --> 09:33.740
Want me to run out
to Five Guys?

09:33.782 --> 09:35.450
I bet I still remember
your pregnancy order.

09:35.492 --> 09:39.913
Triple with cheese, bacon,
ketchup, mustard, mayo,

09:39.954 --> 09:42.207
relish, pickles, jalapeños,

09:42.248 --> 09:45.001
grilled mushrooms,
grilled onions, A1.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.798
- You think I'm gonna go
to Five Guys and not get fries?

09:49.839 --> 09:51.216
Damn, Camille.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.593
This is why we are
no longer together.

09:53.635 --> 09:54.678
- No, no, no. No.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.346
She's not having any burgers.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.723
Dr. Kay said we need
to keep our sodium low.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.100
- Yeah, Dr. Kay.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.227
Dr. Kay is our neonatal
dietary consultant,

10:02.268 --> 10:04.270
which is, you know,
a made-up job.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.064
- Well, Camille ate burgers
last time she was pregnant,

10:06.106 --> 10:07.440
and our daughter's just fine.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.442
- But we're not going
for just fine, now,

10:09.484 --> 10:10.652
are we?
- Okay.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.112
- You can't say that
to a person.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.571
- Honey, you're doing
the controlling thing.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.781
- I'm being chill.
- Again.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.116
- [scoffs]
- Here's how I see it.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.785
Camille, it's your day too,
so go nuts.

10:18.827 --> 10:19.828
- Her day too?
- Yeah.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.329
- Her day too?

10:21.371 --> 10:22.622
Are you gonna--

10:22.664 --> 10:24.958
- Right. Uh, one more thing.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.876
I know Zeta's hitting the pinot
pretty hard today,

10:26.918 --> 10:30.672
but did I hear something
about you grabbing her or--

10:30.714 --> 10:33.466
- Assaulting her?
- I didn't grab anyone.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.093
They were touching Camille
without permission.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.344
- Gaslighting, just saying.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.138
- But I know it was
very inappropriate of me.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.305
I'm so sorry.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.516
And I'll apologize to--
Zeh-ta, was it?

10:41.558 --> 10:42.767
- Yeah. Zeh-ta's fine.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.686
That's--thank you.
That's very generous.

10:44.728 --> 10:47.230
We figured it was
a big misunderstanding.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.816
So hey, how about we get
the hotel chef

10:49.858 --> 10:52.068
to make you that burger
right now?

10:52.110 --> 10:53.445
- "That's nice of you, thanks."

10:53.486 --> 10:54.863
- Great. That's all we got.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.614
Yeah.
We're gonna move this way.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.700
- It's Zeta. It's Zeta.
- Lot of people to talk to.

10:58.742 --> 10:59.826
- Everyone should know
it's Zeta.

10:59.868 --> 11:00.952
- Either pronunciation is fine.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.162
- She's Greek,
and it's offensive.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.663
- Moving this way.
- Bye, friends.

11:03.705 --> 11:05.707
- Don't look back again.
- Okay.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.960
- I mean, I'd have been
just fine if I never met them.

11:12.964 --> 11:14.758
- Is that crowdfunding
for medical stuff?

11:16.843 --> 11:18.011
- I'm gonna be honest.

11:18.053 --> 11:19.929
Tate's not really
registering much.

11:19.971 --> 11:22.223
I'm more reacting to Blythe.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.861
- [sighs] Fine.

11:34.903 --> 11:36.571
If you like 'em, I like 'em.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.365
I can be good.

11:38.406 --> 11:39.908
Just watch.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.287
- Oh.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.247
Have you considered
a C-section?

11:46.289 --> 11:48.041
Like a--like--

11:48.083 --> 11:50.877
I just--I know Blythe would
love to see the baby

11:50.919 --> 11:52.879
looking like his best self,
you know?

11:52.921 --> 11:54.464
Can you translate, please?

11:54.506 --> 11:56.758
- Hey, Ted. Hey, Ted.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.010
- Oh. Ted, he's calling you.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.887
- I'm Craig.
- Who?

12:00.929 --> 12:02.514
- Ted, can you--
can you get Camille?

12:02.555 --> 12:03.556
We're doing pictures.

12:03.598 --> 12:05.433
- Photos.

12:05.475 --> 12:06.810
Photos.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.353
[phone buzzes]
- Yeah, hey.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.854
What's up?

12:09.896 --> 12:11.940
Right now? Fuck!

12:11.981 --> 12:13.733
Hey, just slide in there.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.902
If she's an asshole,
flag me down.

12:15.944 --> 12:18.071
- Camille, where do I put
my hands on the belly?

12:18.113 --> 12:19.280
Is it, like, more like this,

12:19.322 --> 12:20.573
or is it, like, under
like this?

12:20.615 --> 12:21.825
- Well, you have to have
the hands underneath,

12:21.866 --> 12:23.034
or I can see the plastic seams.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.244
- Yeah, but then
my arms look weird

12:24.285 --> 12:26.579
and I kind of look chunky,
and that's gross.

12:26.621 --> 12:29.791
What if we Photoshop
her belly onto my body?

12:29.833 --> 12:31.209
Camille, can I just show him--

12:31.251 --> 12:32.585
- What--hey!
What are you doing?

12:32.627 --> 12:33.712
- Uh, excuse you.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.255
- She has a dress on.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.756
You're gonna show all these
strangers her underwear?

12:36.798 --> 12:37.966
- [laughing]

12:38.008 --> 12:41.052
Okay, this is
a $45,000 baby shower.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.512
There's, like,
so much shit to see.

12:42.554 --> 12:43.930
There's a fucking IV tent.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.724
No one's looking at Camille.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.017
- You can't just
take her clothes off.

12:47.058 --> 12:49.269
She's not a prop.
- I know she's not a prop.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.563
My baby's heartbeat
is with her heartbeat.

12:51.604 --> 12:55.316
So henceforth, my heartbeat
is her heartbeat, okay?

12:55.358 --> 12:57.527
Have you even seen the place
that I put her up in?

12:57.569 --> 12:59.487
It is so fancy.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.072
I care about her.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.741
- Spending money on someone
isn't the same

13:02.782 --> 13:04.034
as caring about them.

13:04.075 --> 13:06.119
- Oh, yeah. Actually, it is.

13:06.161 --> 13:07.954
So now, everything's so clear.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.581
I understand
why you guys got divorced.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.124
Good for you, Camille.
That was so brave.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.292
- Fuck you, Blythe.

13:12.334 --> 13:13.501
- Fuck you, Ted!

13:19.632 --> 13:22.135
- Come.
Come, come, come, come, please.

13:22.177 --> 13:24.220
Can I get
everyone's attention, please?

13:24.262 --> 13:28.475
Today, we are going to reveal
this baby's name!

13:28.516 --> 13:30.477
- I can't believe how you're
letting these rich pricks

13:30.518 --> 13:32.062
control you like this.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.815
- Oh, my God,
this is so brilliant.

13:35.857 --> 13:37.692
And I've been waiting for this.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.611
[screams] That's a V!

13:39.652 --> 13:40.695
- A "V"!

13:40.737 --> 13:42.364
- What could possibly go
with a V?

13:45.200 --> 13:47.744
- What?
[cheers and applause]

13:47.786 --> 13:50.205
A! It's an A!
What is this?

13:50.246 --> 13:51.915
- You guys are gonna die
when you hear this name.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.333
You've never even heard it
before as a name.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.043
Like, it's not used as a name.

13:55.085 --> 13:57.170
- What are you talking about
right now?

13:57.212 --> 13:58.755
- I'm a rascal.
- Okay, we got a V.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.007
We got an A. What's next? Oh!

14:01.049 --> 14:03.093
It's a P!
- It's an androgynous name,

14:03.134 --> 14:04.344
which everybody's doing
right now.

14:04.386 --> 14:05.887
- It's a P!
What are you thinking?

14:05.929 --> 14:07.138
- I think you'll never guess
what it is.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.348
- Vapid?
- No.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.684
- Vapod?
Oh, my gosh, is it Vapod?

14:10.725 --> 14:12.602
- What could it be?

14:12.644 --> 14:14.646
- I'm going. I'm going in.

14:14.688 --> 14:15.897
Oh!

14:15.939 --> 14:17.941
An O!

14:17.982 --> 14:19.567
- My psychic said
it was so important

14:19.609 --> 14:21.444
to have an O in the name.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.071
Okay.

14:23.113 --> 14:25.448
Okay, wait. Drumroll. Hold on.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.701
- Are you guys dying?
Everyone's dying.

14:27.742 --> 14:28.910
Let's do this.

14:28.952 --> 14:31.037
- Just shut up and wait.
[laughs]

14:31.079 --> 14:33.915
- Ready? On your mark.
Get set...

14:33.957 --> 14:35.542
- I just want to be needed!

14:42.882 --> 14:44.718
[balloon pops]

14:44.759 --> 14:46.177
- Vapor.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.263
The baby's name is Vapor.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.890
[scattered applause]
Yay!

14:50.932 --> 14:52.058
It's Vapor.

14:52.100 --> 14:55.145
I love Vapor so much.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.041
- I took a whole day off
from the farm for Camille,

15:16.082 --> 15:17.751
and she still thinks
I want her to be unhappy.

15:17.792 --> 15:19.085
It's crazy.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.670
- But you don't work
at the farm anymore.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.672
- She doesn't know that!

15:22.714 --> 15:24.299
I didn't tell her yet
because it would make her

15:24.341 --> 15:25.759
so happy to know I got fired.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.470
- So you don't want her
to be unhappy,

15:28.511 --> 15:31.181
but you also don't want her
to be too happy?

15:31.222 --> 15:32.891
- If we're gonna be
phone friends, Jillian,

15:32.932 --> 15:34.142
you need to back me up more.

15:34.184 --> 15:36.686
- You're right. I'm sorry.

15:36.728 --> 15:39.314
Camille's a dick.
She's being a fucking asshole.

15:39.356 --> 15:42.150
- [sighs]
No, don't say that.

15:42.192 --> 15:43.610
I'm sorry for dumping
all this on you.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.111
I know you have a lot
going on with the farm.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.529
- Things are actually fine.

15:46.571 --> 15:48.782
We're just getting the next
shipment ready to go out.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.658
- But working for Isaiah
must be miserable.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.160
- I mean, he hasn't
been around much.

15:52.202 --> 15:54.287
It's pretty much
business as usual.

15:54.329 --> 15:57.540
- Except I'm not there?

15:57.582 --> 15:59.084
- Right, yes.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.543
That part's awful.

16:00.585 --> 16:02.003
We need you here.

16:02.045 --> 16:03.672
Angel can't stop sobbing.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.632
- Jillian--
- I haven't been able to eat.

16:05.674 --> 16:07.384
Gabriel is suicidal.

16:07.425 --> 16:08.843
- You can go back to work.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.887
- No! Gabriel, don't do it!

16:10.929 --> 16:12.847
- I'm hanging up now, Jillian.

16:12.889 --> 16:15.850
[tense music]

16:15.892 --> 16:19.562
* *

16:19.604 --> 16:20.730
- So we need to make sure
we film

16:20.772 --> 16:22.524
the opening of the gifts.
- Okay, sure.

16:22.565 --> 16:24.401
Hey, Cam, we're just
making sure you're all right.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.403
We saw Ted storm out.

16:28.571 --> 16:30.115
- Yeah.
Not a big deal, you know?

16:30.156 --> 16:31.157
No harm, no foul.

16:31.199 --> 16:32.617
- Oh, yeah, no big deal,

16:32.659 --> 16:34.619
except for they ruined
the name reveal,

16:34.661 --> 16:36.287
and, like, nobody clapped
for Vapor.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.123
We would have got, like,
the same response to Howard.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.374
Didn't even matter.

16:39.416 --> 16:40.542
- Well, I think
Howard's a fine name.

16:40.583 --> 16:41.835
And, Camille,
you must be exhausted,

16:41.876 --> 16:43.378
so we're gonna get you
back to your hotel, okay?

16:43.420 --> 16:44.379
Up, up.
- Wait, you mean,

16:44.421 --> 16:45.505
like, Joe's gonna drive her.

16:45.547 --> 16:47.215
- No, we should do it.
- What?

16:47.257 --> 16:48.967
- You two can spend
some more time together

16:49.009 --> 16:51.052
and you and Vapor can spend
some more time together.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.429
- But I don't wanna leave
my own party.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.723
That's the main reason
I wanted to have a baby.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.683
- You need more time
with Vapor, babe.

16:56.725 --> 16:58.685
- Could you not yell at me
when I'm on Molly?

16:58.727 --> 17:00.562
- Okay, guess I can
never yell at you, then.

17:00.603 --> 17:02.939
Come on, come on.
- Shit. They're on the move.

17:02.981 --> 17:05.650
I need all units here now.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.194
[phone buzzing]
- Stop texting me, carWOW.

17:08.236 --> 17:10.071
Damn.

17:10.113 --> 17:11.614
- Right through here, honey.

17:11.656 --> 17:12.949
- All of us together?
- All right, this van here.

17:12.991 --> 17:14.075
Yeah. Let's hustle.

17:14.117 --> 17:15.118
Come on. Come on.
- Should I change?

17:15.160 --> 17:16.453
- Come on.
No, you look great.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.705
- The fuck?
- Please move a little faster.

17:18.747 --> 17:20.123
- Excuse me.
- You can change later.

17:20.165 --> 17:21.583
- Excuse me. What's going on?

17:21.624 --> 17:23.835
- Ted, hi.
We're taking Camille home.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.462
But, uh, great work today.

17:25.503 --> 17:27.589
I'm gonna have my assistant
rate you five stars.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.424
Now, let's get in. Time to go.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.176
We're happy to help.
- Are we?

17:31.217 --> 17:32.594
- That's really nice
of you, Tate, but--

17:32.635 --> 17:33.762
- Yeah, it's not a problem.
We got her.

17:33.803 --> 17:35.013
- You don't need to leave
your own party.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.598
- Yeah.
Can he just have her?

17:36.639 --> 17:38.391
Can you go with him?
- No, we are taking her.

17:38.433 --> 17:39.559
- My truck is right over--

17:39.601 --> 17:41.978
- Ted, can you just
shut the fuck up?

17:42.020 --> 17:43.605
[chuckles] I'm kidding.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.357
Can you imagine
if I was that guy?

17:45.398 --> 17:47.233
[chuckles]
All right, we gotta go. Hop in.

17:47.275 --> 17:48.902
All right, in you go.
In, in, in.

17:48.943 --> 17:50.195
Joe, start the car!

17:50.236 --> 17:52.947
Get in! Get seated!
Let's move! Thank you.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.532
- Don't yell at me!
- Joe, start the car.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.826
- I'ma just hop right in here
with y'all.

17:56.868 --> 17:59.162
- Whoa, sir, sir,
you can't just get in here.

17:59.204 --> 18:00.830
Joe, pull over.
We have a stowaway.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.248
- No, there's no time.
Joe, drive.

18:02.290 --> 18:03.792
- We don't need a translator.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.919
Camille's been using her phone
to communicate just fine.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.004
- But we're not going
for just fine, now, are we?

18:08.046 --> 18:10.173
- Are you gonna let him
talk to me like that?

18:10.215 --> 18:11.466
- Like what?
- He said, "We're not going

18:11.508 --> 18:12.801
for just fine, now, are we?"
- Yeah?

18:12.842 --> 18:14.844
- He's using my words
against me, but mean.

18:14.886 --> 18:16.763
- I don't know.
I can't fight him right now.

18:16.805 --> 18:18.807
- Are you kidding me?
Say something--

18:18.848 --> 18:20.308
- That's as much
as I can do right now!

18:20.350 --> 18:22.519
I'm texting!

18:22.560 --> 18:25.313
- So you guys always
ride around in a giant van?

18:25.355 --> 18:27.148
- This is not a van.
We don't paint houses.

18:27.190 --> 18:28.441
This is a Sprinter.

18:28.483 --> 18:29.943
And I brought it
to hold all my presents,

18:29.984 --> 18:31.236
but we left before I could--

18:31.277 --> 18:32.570
- Have your assistant
bring the presents home!

18:32.612 --> 18:34.030
- I fired my assistant, babe.

18:34.072 --> 18:35.782
- Joe, left here. Turn left.

18:35.824 --> 18:37.909
- Um, isn't the hotel
in the other direction?

18:37.951 --> 18:39.077
- Yes. Mm-hmm.

18:39.119 --> 18:40.453
I just gotta stop
by our house real quick

18:40.495 --> 18:42.497
for a--for a business thing.

18:42.539 --> 18:44.541
But good looking out, Ted.
Thank you.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.920
Just a second, okay?
Hank, where are we?

18:48.962 --> 18:50.839
- All packed and ready.
Plane is waiting.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.466
When you're wheels up,
in the air, I will be in touch.

18:53.508 --> 18:55.176
- You're coming in the van
with us.

18:55.218 --> 18:56.720
- Right, of course.

18:56.761 --> 18:58.638
Let me just text my wife
to have a good surgery.

18:58.680 --> 18:59.681
- Uh, we don't have time
for that.

18:59.723 --> 19:01.975
Let's focus.
- Hey, babe?

19:02.017 --> 19:03.685
Why are all the bags out here?

19:03.727 --> 19:04.936
- Oh, uh--

19:04.978 --> 19:08.064
- Wait, are you taking me
on a surprise trip?

19:08.106 --> 19:09.733
Are we going on a baby-moon?

19:09.774 --> 19:11.151
Oh, my God!

19:11.192 --> 19:13.945
I was like, "Why are we
leaving the party so early?

19:13.987 --> 19:16.031
It couldn't be 'cause you care
that much about the surrogate,"

19:16.072 --> 19:17.741
and you don't.

19:17.782 --> 19:18.992
It's about me.

19:19.034 --> 19:20.535
- Oh, yeah.
- [squeals]

19:20.577 --> 19:21.953
- Doing some shredding
there, Tate?

19:21.995 --> 19:23.038
- It's not a big deal, Ted.

19:23.079 --> 19:25.457
We're just making room
for the baby.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.917
We're just leaving shreds
on the curb?

19:27.959 --> 19:30.462
- Shredding andburning!
Come on, guys!

19:30.503 --> 19:32.172
There's a fire pit in the back!

19:32.213 --> 19:33.590
- What the actual fuck
is going on?

19:33.631 --> 19:35.300
- Uh, let's talk about it
in the van.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.218
All right? Hop on.
- Okay.

19:37.260 --> 19:39.721
I'm--yeah, why are there
bags of trash?

19:39.763 --> 19:41.348
- Hop aboard.

19:41.389 --> 19:42.891
Luggage, Hank.

19:42.932 --> 19:45.852
[suspenseful music]

19:45.894 --> 19:48.897
* *

19:48.938 --> 19:49.731
Yeah, we got time.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.441
Okay.
[clears throat]

19:51.483 --> 19:53.234
So we may be in a bit
of financial trouble, and--

19:53.276 --> 19:54.444
- What?

19:54.486 --> 19:55.904
- The SEC might be
looking for me.

19:55.945 --> 19:57.572
- No.
- And you.

19:57.614 --> 19:59.699
And it's possible they were
gonna raid the baby shower

19:59.741 --> 20:01.242
before I was
theoretically tipped off.

20:01.284 --> 20:02.452
- What kind
of financial trouble?

20:02.494 --> 20:03.912
- It's just a tax goof,
something about

20:03.953 --> 20:06.206
HelpMePayMyBills.com's
filing status.

20:06.247 --> 20:07.874
- I'm sorry,
does the SEC usually raid

20:07.916 --> 20:09.626
people's baby showers
over goofs?

20:09.668 --> 20:11.086
- They're also
accusing the company

20:11.127 --> 20:12.504
of defrauding its users.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.588
- We may have stolen
hundreds of millions

20:13.630 --> 20:14.714
of dollars in donations.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.925
- We? "We" we?
We, you and me?

20:16.966 --> 20:18.468
- Your name is on
all the documents.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.011
You wanted to be
co-CEO, remember?

20:20.053 --> 20:21.680
- Yeah, but that's
just a fake thing!

20:21.721 --> 20:22.806
That was just so I could go

20:22.847 --> 20:24.099
to Reese Witherspoon's
Girlboss Brunch.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.225
- Well, too late!

20:25.266 --> 20:27.268
- Am I going to jail?
- No!

20:27.310 --> 20:28.687
Those are our go-bags,

20:28.728 --> 20:30.855
and Hank has a jet
waiting to take us to Vietnam.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.607
- And you're dropping us off
on the way, or--

20:32.649 --> 20:35.068
- Vietnam is the least
chic place I've ever heard of.

20:35.110 --> 20:37.028
You might as well take us
to fucking Somalia.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.781
- We have to go somewhere
without an extradition treaty.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.576
- "If you're fleeing,
what's the plan for the baby?"

20:43.618 --> 20:44.828
- That's why
we stuffed you in--

20:44.869 --> 20:46.788
brought you in the van,
to see if you wanted

20:46.830 --> 20:49.916
to come to Vietnam with us,
just until Vapor's born.

20:49.958 --> 20:51.042
- She says, "Hell no."

20:51.084 --> 20:53.628
- Okay, okay.
Okay, what about Morocco?

20:53.670 --> 20:55.130
Morocco.
I'm looking at--

20:55.171 --> 20:57.924
here's a list of countries
without extradition treaties.

20:57.966 --> 21:00.593
The Maldives,
like in "The Bachelor."

21:00.635 --> 21:02.345
They have those little houses
over the water.

21:02.387 --> 21:03.972
- She's not going
to Morocco either.

21:04.014 --> 21:05.807
- No, we're going
to the Maldives now.

21:05.849 --> 21:08.476
New plan.
- This isn't a vacation, babe.

21:08.518 --> 21:09.769
But the Maldives does sound
way better.

21:09.811 --> 21:11.771
How the fuck did you land
on Vietnam, Hank?

21:11.813 --> 21:13.732
- I had 45 minutes
to throw this together.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.859
I had to give the pilot
my father's watch.

21:17.569 --> 21:19.821
- She says she has a life here.

21:19.863 --> 21:23.116
And yeah, is it illegal
to share a jet with fugitives?

21:23.158 --> 21:24.909
Could she even come back?
- Yeah, of course.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.327
Yeah, not a problem.
- That's unclear.

21:26.369 --> 21:27.495
- What the fuck, Hank?

21:27.537 --> 21:29.330
Look, we had a contract, okay?

21:29.372 --> 21:30.957
You got paid, and in return,

21:30.999 --> 21:33.501
you agreed
to deliver us a baby.

21:33.543 --> 21:36.004
- She said
you still owe her 40 grand.

21:36.046 --> 21:38.256
- Because she hasn't
given us our baby yet.

21:38.298 --> 21:39.799
That is our property,
all right?

21:39.841 --> 21:41.509
If you don't get on the plane
with us, it's stealing.

21:41.551 --> 21:42.677
- That's not technically
how it works.

21:42.719 --> 21:44.304
- God damn it, Hank,
one more word--

21:44.346 --> 21:46.348
one more word, and you don't
get to come to Vietnam.

21:46.389 --> 21:47.932
- The Maldives.
- I can't go to Vietnam.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.059
I have a family.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.810
- We need someone
who speaks the language.

21:50.852 --> 21:52.228
- I don't speak Vietnamese.

21:52.270 --> 21:54.981
- There's Duolingo, and it's
a 13-hour fucking flight.

21:55.023 --> 21:56.232
You're going.

21:56.274 --> 21:58.401
Okay. We can pay.

21:58.443 --> 21:59.861
What do we owe you, 40K?

21:59.903 --> 22:02.072
Would you come with us
if we made it an even 100?

22:02.113 --> 22:03.782
Hmm?
- No.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.283
- 200.
- She said she isn't going.

22:05.325 --> 22:06.368
- $300,000.

22:06.409 --> 22:07.702
- We said no!

22:07.744 --> 22:10.038
This isn't "Deal or No Deal."

22:10.080 --> 22:11.706
- What--where are we?

22:11.748 --> 22:13.291
- Just one last stop.
I'll be right back.

22:13.333 --> 22:14.417
Keep negotiating, babe.

22:14.459 --> 22:15.627
Everyone has a price.

22:15.669 --> 22:17.212
- Actually, my legs
are getting stiff.

22:17.253 --> 22:19.714
Camille and I might, uh,
go for a little walk.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.841
Take a stretch, you know?
- Yeah.

22:21.883 --> 22:23.677
Maybe we should
all stick together.

22:23.718 --> 22:25.470
Joe, help our new friends.

22:25.512 --> 22:27.055
- Where are we?

22:27.097 --> 22:28.556
[dog barking]

22:28.598 --> 22:30.725
Babe, this is
a dangerous neighborhood.

22:30.767 --> 22:31.935
- This neighborhood
is totally fine.

22:31.976 --> 22:33.561
Normal people live here.
- What normal people

22:33.603 --> 22:35.188
do you know
with houses this small?

22:35.230 --> 22:36.606
- The person that lives here.

22:36.648 --> 22:39.401
- Joe, you're standing
kind of close, man.

22:39.442 --> 22:40.777
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

22:40.819 --> 22:42.779
- What's going on?
Who are all these people?

22:42.821 --> 22:45.156
- Uh, yeah, Tiff, I need you
to grab that bag I left here.

22:45.198 --> 22:46.741
You know, the leather satchel?
- Yeah.

22:46.783 --> 22:47.826
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

22:47.867 --> 22:51.746
Of course, baby.
- Do it. Quickly.

22:51.788 --> 22:54.416
- Who the fuck is Tiff?
- Grow up, Blythe.

22:54.457 --> 22:56.918
We all know what this is,
right, everyone?

22:56.960 --> 22:57.794
- No!

22:57.836 --> 22:59.129
- Yeah.
- No!

22:59.170 --> 23:01.840
I have sacrificed
so much shit for you.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.800
I keep my body tight for you.

23:03.842 --> 23:06.302
Three-a-days,
macro tracking, Ensure IVs.

23:06.344 --> 23:07.595
I got a fucking surrogate.

23:07.637 --> 23:08.930
- Wait, I thought
the doctor said

23:08.972 --> 23:10.056
you "couldn't have a child"?

23:10.098 --> 23:11.933
- He did.
He is my plastic surgeon.

23:11.975 --> 23:14.519
And he was like,
"Girl, you can't have a child,

23:14.561 --> 23:15.603
not with that body."

23:15.645 --> 23:18.231
So whatever. Same thing!

23:18.273 --> 23:20.191
- Here you go, baby.
- You're moving so slow.

23:20.233 --> 23:21.943
- If you call him baby
one more fucking time--

23:21.985 --> 23:24.154
- Look, Camille!
Here's all the cash, see?

23:24.195 --> 23:26.114
300K.
- She doesn't want your money.

23:26.156 --> 23:28.450
- What?
[laughs]

23:28.491 --> 23:30.368
- Good god, Tate.

23:30.410 --> 23:31.786
Are you kidding?

23:31.828 --> 23:34.289
Did you give my fucking
diamonds to your whore?

23:34.330 --> 23:35.623
- Wow.

23:35.665 --> 23:38.251
Girls from your generation
are broken, babe.

23:38.293 --> 23:40.587
- We are the same age.

23:40.628 --> 23:42.922
- No.
- And that is so fucked up.

23:42.964 --> 23:44.966
- Okay, take the diamonds.
They're yours.

23:45.008 --> 23:46.801
But if the Feds come,
I need you to swallow 'em.

23:46.843 --> 23:48.553
- You want me to eat
these fucking diamonds?

23:48.595 --> 23:50.055
You eat them.
- How dare you?

23:50.096 --> 23:51.806
I have my throat thing.
- How dare you?

23:51.848 --> 23:54.184
You know I don't swallow.
Never.

23:54.225 --> 23:56.561
- Not a problem for me.

23:56.603 --> 23:58.688
- Are you gonna--oh, no!

23:58.730 --> 24:00.523
- No, no, no, don't lose that.
Shit!

24:00.565 --> 24:01.816
- You fucking skank!
- God damn it, Joe,

24:01.858 --> 24:03.485
The diamond!
- [screaming]

24:03.526 --> 24:04.986
- You dropped some.
Come on, Hank!

24:05.028 --> 24:07.072
Too good to pick up diamonds?
Whoa, whoa. Hey!

24:07.113 --> 24:08.490
Come back here
with my property!

24:08.531 --> 24:11.117
- There's only one left!
- Hey, hey, come on, come on.

24:11.159 --> 24:13.203
[grunting]

24:13.244 --> 24:14.371
Come on.

24:14.412 --> 24:15.747
300,000 wasn't my final price.

24:15.789 --> 24:17.207
We can still negotiate.

24:17.248 --> 24:19.167
- See? There's the problem!

24:19.209 --> 24:22.420
You think being rich means
never having any consequences.

24:22.462 --> 24:24.631
Defrauding thousands of people?
Doesn't matter.

24:24.673 --> 24:26.007
You just flee the country.

24:26.049 --> 24:27.967
Cheating on your wife?
Doesn't matter.

24:28.009 --> 24:30.261
She'll be fighting to swallow
your diamonds in no time.

24:30.303 --> 24:31.471
But guess what.

24:31.513 --> 24:32.972
There's still some things
money can't buy,

24:33.014 --> 24:35.183
and Camille is
one of those things.

24:35.225 --> 24:38.186
So I'ma go call the Feds,
tell them where you are,

24:38.228 --> 24:39.854
and when you get to prison,
let 'em know

24:39.896 --> 24:41.690
it was Ted who sent you.

24:41.731 --> 24:43.108
[engine turns over]

24:47.904 --> 24:49.989
- Great, Joe. Fuck!

24:50.031 --> 24:53.201
- Whoo-hoo!
I was right. I knew it!

24:53.243 --> 24:55.578
Never trust white people
in color-coordinating outfits.

24:55.620 --> 24:57.622
[laughs]

24:58.915 --> 25:00.333
What's up with you?

25:16.516 --> 25:18.977
- You wanna flee the country
with these crooks?

25:25.275 --> 25:27.027
- Probably 20s in there
for padding.

25:33.908 --> 25:35.368
- That was a nightmare!

25:35.410 --> 25:36.745
Plus, I needed that money.

25:36.786 --> 25:37.871
You don't.

25:37.912 --> 25:39.998
You have your job.

25:44.627 --> 25:45.920
- What?

25:56.389 --> 25:58.016
- Why didn't you tell me?

26:05.899 --> 26:08.109
- Embarrassing? Why?

26:08.151 --> 26:10.820
People lose their jobs
all the time.

26:10.862 --> 26:12.614
I mean, I--

26:12.655 --> 26:16.284
[tense music]

26:16.326 --> 26:18.828
I still have the farm.

26:18.870 --> 26:20.705
Let me help you.

26:36.012 --> 26:37.430
- What did you say to me?
- Please stop talking.

26:37.472 --> 26:39.432
- You stop talking
and listen to me for once.

26:39.474 --> 26:41.685
Like, I don't even know
what the fuck my life is.

26:41.726 --> 26:43.353
Like, what have you done to me?

26:43.395 --> 26:44.437
- Done to you?

26:44.479 --> 26:46.314
Everything you have
is because of me!

26:46.356 --> 26:48.066
When I met you,
you had roommates.

26:48.108 --> 26:50.443
- I was a freshman in college!

26:50.485 --> 26:52.070
- Yeah, at a state school.

26:52.112 --> 26:53.154
- But I was out of state.

26:53.196 --> 26:54.781
I paid full price for that.

26:54.823 --> 26:55.949
- Ugh.

26:55.990 --> 26:58.326
What the fuck is this?

26:58.368 --> 27:01.329
[van beeping]

27:01.371 --> 27:08.294
* *

27:15.635 --> 27:18.221
- What's up, Tate?
- Hi, Ted.

27:18.263 --> 27:20.223
- Hey, so you probably
don't even remember,

27:20.265 --> 27:22.225
but I kind of had
a big speech earlier.

27:22.267 --> 27:23.435
- About how I'm a rich asshole

27:23.476 --> 27:25.061
and there's some things
money can't buy.

27:25.103 --> 27:27.397
- Mm, good.
It made an impact on you.

27:27.439 --> 27:30.233
Anyway, I stand by
the broader social critique.

27:30.275 --> 27:33.153
Lots of stuff
for you to marinate on.

27:33.194 --> 27:36.072
But in this specific case,

27:36.114 --> 27:38.408
money will get you
exactly what you want.

27:38.450 --> 27:42.746
$300,000,
Camille will go to Vietnam.

27:42.787 --> 27:44.247
We will take cash,

27:44.289 --> 27:47.083
or if young miss wants
to cough up a few diamonds.

27:47.125 --> 27:48.918
- Yeah, great. Either one.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.086
Yeah? You can puke, right?

27:50.128 --> 27:52.505
All right, pop out.
Joe's driving.

27:52.547 --> 27:54.299
- I'll keep the money safe
until you get back.

27:54.341 --> 27:57.802
Nessa and I will FaceTime
with you every night, okay?

27:57.844 --> 28:01.056
- [coughing]

28:02.182 --> 28:03.475
- Why the fuck is she here?

28:03.516 --> 28:06.061
Is she coming to the Maldives
with us?

28:06.102 --> 28:07.854
- You wouldn't swallow
the fucking diamonds.

28:07.896 --> 28:10.690
- My stomach feels so random.

28:10.732 --> 28:11.983
[coughs]

28:12.025 --> 28:14.235
Wait, what?

28:14.277 --> 28:15.320
- Hey, Joe?

28:15.362 --> 28:16.946
There's a garage up ahead
on the left.

28:16.988 --> 28:19.032
Turn there
and head up to the roof.

28:19.074 --> 28:21.117
Okay, so a helicopter is
gonna meet us up there,

28:21.159 --> 28:23.286
take us to Tallahassee
where we'll have a jet.

28:23.328 --> 28:24.996
Then we'll go to Canada
to refuel,

28:25.038 --> 28:26.831
and then on to Hanoi.

28:26.873 --> 28:28.625
Wait, Joe, what are you doing?

28:28.667 --> 28:29.834
You're going down.

28:29.876 --> 28:30.835
We don't have time for--

28:30.877 --> 28:32.128
[sirens wailing]

28:32.170 --> 28:35.131
[indistinct radio chatter]

28:36.216 --> 28:38.176
- What the fuck?
How did they beat us here?

28:38.218 --> 28:40.136
- Exit the vehicle
with your hands up.

28:40.178 --> 28:43.014
- So the thing is,
after Ted left us stranded

28:43.056 --> 28:45.308
without a van,
I thought there was no way out.

28:45.350 --> 28:47.644
So I called the SEC
and turned state's evidence.

28:47.686 --> 28:49.187
- You have ten seconds.

28:49.229 --> 28:51.064
- I got reduced sentences
for me and Blythe.

28:51.106 --> 28:52.565
- [sighs]
- Yeah.

28:52.607 --> 28:55.151
But in exchange, I had
to give up the real mastermind

28:55.193 --> 28:56.986
behind HelpMePayMyBills.com

28:57.028 --> 28:58.655
- Wait,
who's the real mastermind?

28:58.697 --> 28:59.989
- We had a rogue
financial manager

29:00.031 --> 29:01.658
cooking the books
without our knowledge.

29:01.700 --> 29:03.410
- Hank, you piece of shit.

29:03.451 --> 29:04.619
- What? No.

29:04.661 --> 29:06.413
I only ever did
what you told me to do.

29:06.454 --> 29:07.789
- Unbelievable.

29:07.831 --> 29:09.124
- I tried
to talk you out of it.

29:09.165 --> 29:11.501
- Hank Ridgeway,
you're under arrest.

29:11.543 --> 29:13.461
- No. No, no, no, no.

29:13.503 --> 29:16.172
He's the mastermind!
He's the mastermind!

29:16.214 --> 29:17.132
No!

29:17.173 --> 29:19.009
Your father hired me!

29:19.050 --> 29:20.385
I've known you
since you were a kid!

29:20.427 --> 29:22.345
Fuck!
- Oh, this is ours.

29:22.387 --> 29:25.015
This has nothing
to do with them.

29:25.056 --> 29:26.182
She's a surrogate.

29:26.224 --> 29:29.894
No crimes. No crimes!

29:29.936 --> 29:31.521
- Comes around
goes around, Hank.

29:31.563 --> 29:34.065
Geez.

29:34.107 --> 29:35.942
So I'm sorry.

29:35.984 --> 29:38.028
The government has frozen
all our assets.

29:38.069 --> 29:39.988
I was gonna have Tiffany
shit out those diamonds,

29:40.030 --> 29:42.032
but I guess
they're cutting her up inside,

29:42.073 --> 29:43.616
and she needs surgery.

29:43.658 --> 29:45.493
- Hey, fam, so a twist.

29:45.535 --> 29:46.828
I might lose my asshole.

29:46.870 --> 29:48.371
- Karma.

29:48.413 --> 29:50.081
That's what you get
for letting a side ho

29:50.123 --> 29:51.875
do a wife's job, just saying.

29:51.916 --> 29:53.710
- So we don't have the 300K.

29:53.752 --> 29:55.754
We don't even have 40K.

29:55.795 --> 29:59.924
But we had a contract,
and since we can't pay,

29:59.966 --> 30:01.926
you get to keep the baby.

30:04.763 --> 30:06.389
- She says...

30:07.265 --> 30:08.641
You get it.
- Mm.

30:08.683 --> 30:10.643
- Babe, I'm gonna be in jail
for just a little bit.

30:10.685 --> 30:13.063
But then I'm gonna have
my people call your people

30:13.104 --> 30:14.981
as soon as baby Vapor is born.

30:15.023 --> 30:16.399
You guys can get to know
each other a little bit,

30:16.441 --> 30:17.692
and then they'll come grab him.

30:17.734 --> 30:19.235
And if you could just,
like, breastfeed him

30:19.277 --> 30:20.779
for a few weeks,
that would be so nice.

30:20.820 --> 30:22.405
But obviously, like,
your body, your choice.

30:22.447 --> 30:23.948
Just, like, do the right thing
for the baby.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.408
I'll have my assistant
find you, okay?

30:25.450 --> 30:27.035
You're a saint, Camille.
Thank you so much.

30:27.077 --> 30:28.119
- Nice. Take care.

30:28.161 --> 30:29.537
- Didn't you fire
your assistant?

30:31.539 --> 30:33.208
- Well, first,
we're going to Five Guys.

30:33.249 --> 30:34.584
Get some extra sodium in you.

30:39.714 --> 30:41.633
- It's okay, okay?

30:41.675 --> 30:43.593
I'm here for you.
