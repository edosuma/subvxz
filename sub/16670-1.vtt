03:58.917 --> 04:00.590
Wake up...

04:05.917 --> 04:07.214
Wake up...

04:34.667 --> 04:35.463
Hello?

04:35.708 --> 04:36.960
<i>Is this Geoff?</i>

04:37.208 --> 04:37.879
Yeah.

04:38.167 --> 04:41.296
<i>This is Samuel here, we were
expecting you this morning?</i>

04:42.500 --> 04:46.801
Oh, Samuel... ah.
I completely passed out.

04:47.583 --> 04:49.631
<i>Okay, we'll see you soon.</i>

05:08.708 --> 05:11.302
Hi, Geoff Burton for
Samuel Mead, please.

05:15.958 --> 05:18.802
Injecting room here,
got your stereomicroscope.

05:18.875 --> 05:20.718
Quarantine room
for incoming animals.

05:20.792 --> 05:23.636
Microscope room with
confocal imaging station

05:23.708 --> 05:26.257
- all the usual stuff:
Spinning disk confocal,

05:26.333 --> 05:30.509
twophoton confocal, upright
confocals with dipping lenses,

05:30.583 --> 05:32.256
all the laser lines you could wish for.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.461
Anything to make science beautiful.

05:34.542 --> 05:37.512
We've got a cold room,
we've got a microbial culture room;

05:37.583 --> 05:39.301
the autoclaves are downstairs.

05:40.750 --> 05:41.876
There's a...

05:42.708 --> 05:44.085
How's your
accommodation, Geoffrey?

05:44.167 --> 05:45.214
Oh, fine, fine.

05:45.292 --> 05:47.511
I was just wondering where
my office is going to be?

05:47.583 --> 05:50.132
Oh, we don't really
do 'offices' per se.

05:50.208 --> 05:52.552
We're more communal than that.

05:52.625 --> 05:54.969
Of course, we can loan you a lab
for the length of a given project.

05:55.542 --> 05:56.384
Right...

06:04.625 --> 06:05.626
Look who I found.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.085
- Doctor Burton.
- Doctor Fiedler.

06:09.458 --> 06:12.086
Rebekka's come a long way since
she was interned with you.

06:12.167 --> 06:13.339
Yes, so I hear.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.710
I'm sorry I can't leave this right now.

06:17.375 --> 06:19.343
- We'll catch up later.
- Great.

06:20.958 --> 06:22.426
- Shall we continue?
- Yes.

06:26.792 --> 06:27.588
That way.

06:27.958 --> 06:29.801
Now, there's something
else we need to do...

06:30.833 --> 06:32.255
Sorry, I didn't...

06:40.083 --> 06:43.257
Anyway, let's get your
security pass sorted out.

06:53.833 --> 06:55.085
Son of a bitch...

07:04.417 --> 07:05.134
<i>Geoff...</i>

07:06.792 --> 07:07.884
How are you?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.468
<i>I'm fine, you?</i>

07:09.542 --> 07:14.127
I'm good. I'm setting up
the new research lab.

07:14.667 --> 07:16.886
<i>The one in Munich right?</i>

07:17.500 --> 07:20.219
No, Dresden... remember?

07:20.958 --> 07:22.710
<i>So, you must be happy?</i>

07:22.875 --> 07:24.252
What's that supposed to mean?

07:24.458 --> 07:27.541
- <i>It's nothing, forget about it...</i>
- <i>Hey babe! I'm home.</i>

07:27.625 --> 07:28.672
<i>Hold on for</i> a <i>second.</i>

07:31.000 --> 07:32.968
<i>So... what's up?</i>

07:35.042 --> 07:36.510
I heard about your news.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.173
When were
you planning to tell me?

07:41.333 --> 07:43.927
<i>I was going to tell you, I really was.</i>

07:44.000 --> 07:45.092
<i>Fm in my second month,</i>

07:45.167 --> 07:50.128
<i>I wasn't quite sure
and I didn't tell anyone else.</i>

07:50.208 --> 07:51.460
Well, Joe and Karla knew.

07:52.750 --> 07:55.424
<i>Oh, no. That was Ben.</i>

07:55.458 --> 07:56.584
Right. Ben.

07:57.208 --> 08:00.667
<i>He was excited about the
baby so he just told them.</i>

08:00.708 --> 08:01.504
<i>You know...?</i>

08:04.708 --> 08:05.834
<i>You're angry?</i>

08:10.458 --> 08:11.254
No.

08:12.292 --> 08:13.293
<i>Of course.</i>

08:13.792 --> 08:15.465
No. I'm not angry...

08:16.292 --> 08:19.842
I'm just, I don't know.
I gotta think about it.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.635
<i>Think about what?</i>

08:22.625 --> 08:25.504
Well, what do you want me
to say? Congratulations?

08:25.625 --> 08:28.549
<i>I dunno. Maybe you
can be happy for me.</i>

08:29.667 --> 08:32.750
<i>What do you want?
Why did you call me?</i>

08:33.750 --> 08:35.548
I don't know why I called.

08:40.832 --> 08:41.958
I miss you.

08:44.542 --> 08:45.714
<i>I have to go.</i>

09:25.958 --> 09:27.801
Geoffrey Burton comes
to us from U-Mass,

09:27.875 --> 09:29.718
where his research
into early detection

09:29.792 --> 09:33.217
of embryonic abnormalities has
certainly proved one of the more,

09:33.292 --> 09:37.092
ah, fiercely-debated topics in the
scientific community this decade.

09:37.583 --> 09:40.382
Now, I don't need to tell you
what the implications of this are.

09:40.458 --> 09:43.632
The proverbial 'cure for cancer'
has always eluded us.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.836
But the potential of
pre-natal discovery

09:45.917 --> 09:48.466
certainly brings the possibility
a few steps closer.

09:48.625 --> 09:50.502
And Geoffrey has now
come here to continue

09:50.583 --> 09:54.338
his research in a rather less
politicized environment,

09:54.417 --> 09:56.294
and he's going to speak
to us this morning

09:56.375 --> 09:57.922
about the state of his work to date.

09:59.875 --> 10:01.092
When you're ready...

10:01.833 --> 10:02.755
Thank you.

10:03.583 --> 10:07.292
Will you now all please join me
in welcoming Geoffrey Burton.

10:14.458 --> 10:17.052
Thank you, thank you, Samuel...

10:17.708 --> 10:19.961
I never intended to
become a geneticist.

10:20.042 --> 10:23.012
My PhD. was actually on
bacterial biochemistry.

10:23.625 --> 10:25.969
But, as I'm sure many of you know,
I was drawn to this

10:26.042 --> 10:29.546
by my experience with my own son,
whose condition led me to focus

10:29.625 --> 10:34.461
my research on screening embryos
for traces of rare genetic mutations

10:34.542 --> 10:35.259
such as his.

10:36.875 --> 10:38.297
I want to make one thing very clear:

10:38.375 --> 10:40.218
this is not eugenics.
I'm not trying to develop

10:40.292 --> 10:42.420
new techniques to pre-screen
people with brown eyes,

10:42.500 --> 10:46.585
or dark skin, or freckles. I like freckles.

10:46.667 --> 10:48.294
Diversity -

10:48.375 --> 10:51.675
one of the things which defines us
as a species is to be celebrated.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.504
Mutations which endanger
human life are not.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.459
For example - here we see the
subject in the earliest stages.

10:59.542 --> 11:02.341
The disease is non-contagious
in the traditional sense,

11:02.417 --> 11:04.215
yet at the same time,
unusually virulent.

11:05.375 --> 11:08.504
I've allowed myself the conceit
of calling it Burton's Syndrome.

11:10.458 --> 11:13.132
What made this syndrome noteworthy
was its sudden appearance

11:13.208 --> 11:15.302
in what appeared to be a
perfectly healthy subject.

11:16.625 --> 11:17.717
Within a matter of days,

11:17.792 --> 11:20.796
the symptoms had manifested
as a number of neoplasms,

11:20.875 --> 11:23.003
exponentially multiplying
and growing in size.

11:23.958 --> 11:25.756
These, ah, tumor-like

11:25.833 --> 11:28.586
appendages eventually covered the
entire body, as we can see.

11:29.125 --> 11:31.594
Respiration became
increasingly difficult.

11:31.667 --> 11:33.715
They began to affect
the internal organs -

11:33.792 --> 11:36.511
crushing the heart,
constricting the lungs...

11:36.583 --> 11:38.506
Brain activity ceased
shortly thereafter.

11:41.583 --> 11:44.883
From first symptoms to death, the
entire process took little over a week.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.594
What made this unique was that
this was not an acquired disease -

11:49.667 --> 11:53.422
like a virus, but a seemingly
random genetic mutation

11:53.500 --> 11:57.084
occurring in gene RIPS
on chromosome twenty.

12:01.417 --> 12:04.626
All right. Let's take a closer
look at some tissue samples...

12:24.250 --> 12:25.467
May I sit here?

12:34.792 --> 12:37.671
People don't want to know
the way things happen.

12:39.333 --> 12:45.966
This fish, for example - no one wants
to think of it suffocating in agony.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.174
We just want to fry it, eat it, forget.

12:51.417 --> 12:53.090
Same with science.

12:53.542 --> 12:56.512
People want the cure,
but not the research.

12:56.875 --> 12:59.754
It makes them uncomfortable,
knowing how you got there.

12:59.833 --> 13:01.961
What you had to do, to what.

13:04.167 --> 13:05.259
It's true.

13:05.625 --> 13:10.677
I would like to live a million years
just to see what we evolve into.

13:10.750 --> 13:13.629
Do we become telepathic?
Do we get wings?

13:16.500 --> 13:18.173
I would like wings.

13:20.292 --> 13:22.545
And you? What would you like?

13:23.125 --> 13:27.175
I don't know. I'd like
to be a time traveler,

13:27.250 --> 13:29.298
you know, travel through time
backwards and forwards...

13:29.375 --> 13:32.049
Chiba! Are those
incubations done yet?

13:40.042 --> 13:42.170
Hello, I'm Jarek Novak.

13:42.250 --> 13:44.423
Geoffrey Burton.
We actually met yesterday.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.844
I almost liberated your mouse.

13:47.167 --> 13:49.169
- I didn't know it was you.
- It's me.

13:50.083 --> 13:53.838
Your lecture, I really
liked it. Great images.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.380
Thank you. I guess.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.673
I was thinking

14:00.750 --> 14:03.424
maybe you'd like to look at some
things I've been working on?

14:03.500 --> 14:04.922
In kind of a similar vein, you know?

14:05.417 --> 14:06.760
Yeah. Why not.

14:06.958 --> 14:10.087
- Good. We should have a drink.
- Sure.

14:10.167 --> 14:11.635
What about tonight?

14:20.042 --> 14:23.751
Will you excuse me a minute?
Excuse me. Sorry.

14:42.500 --> 14:45.049
- No thank you. I quit.
- You quit?

14:45.125 --> 14:45.796
Yeah.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.469
I guess it has been a while
since I've seen you last.

14:49.667 --> 14:51.135
Yeah, that was your choice.

14:54.125 --> 14:58.335
I'm sorry. You know, I...

14:58.417 --> 14:59.964
I don't want it to be awkward.

15:01.083 --> 15:02.335
I don't either.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.252
You know, I have been
watching you, though.

15:10.583 --> 15:12.631
I've been watching your rise.

15:13.167 --> 15:16.296
Read all your papers.
Very impressive.

15:19.125 --> 15:21.423
You're the one who got Samuel
to approach me, right?

15:23.542 --> 15:28.844
You know, I... I felt like I'd
hit a wall with my research.

15:28.917 --> 15:33.969
And, you know, I heard what you
were dealing with in America,

15:34.042 --> 15:38.297
so I thought perhaps
you'd like to come over.

15:40.125 --> 15:44.926
I don't know, to be honest,
I didn't expect you to say yes.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.377
What have I said yes to?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.001
I can show you.

15:53.417 --> 15:56.045
- Let's go back.
- Good, cos my ass is cold.

16:09.167 --> 16:10.089
Have a seat.

16:15.333 --> 16:16.960
Okay, so.

16:18.958 --> 16:20.460
Now here...

16:24.667 --> 16:26.886
This is a typical regeneration cycle.

16:26.958 --> 16:29.882
About ten weeks from amputation
to full regeneration. Yes?

16:30.667 --> 16:31.384
Yes.

16:31.708 --> 16:34.427
Okay, so now watch this one.

16:40.667 --> 16:41.759
Did you see?

16:42.167 --> 16:43.544
Ah, missed it.

16:44.750 --> 16:47.094
I'll play it again. Watch closely.

16:55.375 --> 16:56.718
You're kidding, right?

17:01.833 --> 17:03.255
That's not possible.

17:06.583 --> 17:09.132
When I inserted the Easter Gene,
I found it accelerated

17:09.208 --> 17:11.676
the natural regeneration
capacity of the axolotls,

17:11.750 --> 17:13.673
way beyond anything
I could have imagined.

17:14.375 --> 17:17.002
But since then, I've refined
the genetic code further.

17:17.083 --> 17:19.882
Wait a minute, what 'Easter Gene'?
What are you talking about?

17:20.875 --> 17:21.376
Look...

17:22.958 --> 17:27.919
I labeled only the transplanted
Easter Gene cells with the GFP.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.094
They were localized
in the wound area,

17:30.167 --> 17:33.751
but then they completely
took over. Look for yourself.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.468
That's ah...

17:49.958 --> 17:51.551
I've even had success regenerating

17:51.625 --> 17:53.719
severely damaged
brain and spinal tissue.

17:53.792 --> 17:56.386
I mean, can you imagine the
possibilities for this in humans?

17:57.083 --> 17:59.836
- Jesus Christ...
- Exactly! Easter.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.502
Why haven't you published this?

18:03.542 --> 18:04.794
I dunno.

18:06.458 --> 18:08.176
A discovery's not a cure.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.297
Even so, I mean...

18:10.417 --> 18:13.216
- It won't even uptake in mice.
- What happens when you try?

18:13.458 --> 18:14.459
Nothing.

18:16.083 --> 18:19.087
I've been stuck for six months now.

18:19.167 --> 18:20.669
And then I thought:
if anyone could help me

18:20.750 --> 18:25.631
with the molecular mechanism,
to help me activate it in mammals...

18:29.500 --> 18:31.719
You know, I'm sorry, I've got an
appointment with Samuel right now.

18:31.792 --> 18:34.170
But what do you think about,
you know, discussing this later

18:34.250 --> 18:36.048
over dinner, at my place?

18:36.250 --> 18:38.628
- What are you doing tonight?
- Nothing.

18:38.708 --> 18:40.551
I can cook something
for you. German.

18:40.667 --> 18:43.796
- I like German.
- Don't worry. it's not a date.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.251
Hey!

18:52.542 --> 18:53.384
Hey...

18:54.000 --> 18:57.709
Looks like we're having a drink
tonight after all - just not together.

19:13.833 --> 19:15.210
Come on, I'll give you a lift.

19:15.292 --> 19:16.919
I'm not going back to
the guesthouse, so...

19:17.000 --> 19:18.422
it's cold, come on!

19:19.208 --> 19:20.084
Alright...

19:27.667 --> 19:29.385
You want to try an
electrical cigarette?

19:30.917 --> 19:35.753
Ah, no. I've got my own.
Real cigarette.

19:39.417 --> 19:43.047
Ah, I'm sorry, but it's
a non smoking car.

19:46.583 --> 19:47.550
Of course.

19:53.208 --> 19:54.084
Sorry.

19:54.333 --> 19:57.007
It's okay. Where we going?

19:57.625 --> 20:01.084
Oh, yeah, right. Sorry ah...

20:04.250 --> 20:06.298
- Pfotenhau... Pfoten...
- Can I see it?

20:07.667 --> 20:11.342
Ah, PfotenhauerstraBe.
Yes, I know it.

20:11.542 --> 20:13.636
Good. That's where we're going.

20:14.167 --> 20:17.216
- I know you, also. Very well.
- Yeah. You do?

20:17.583 --> 20:21.838
Yes. Your science.
We're the same, both of us.

20:23.458 --> 20:25.005
And how do you figure?

20:25.083 --> 20:29.964
You know. Taking risks. Whatever
it takes for a new brave world.

20:30.917 --> 20:33.636
New Brave World?
Yeah, I haven't read that one...

20:35.333 --> 20:41.750
I have ideas, even if I say it
myself, brilliant experiments.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.044
You could be part of them.

20:44.417 --> 20:45.964
Well, that's a very kind offer.

20:46.042 --> 20:48.761
But, ah, my work's kind of
a full-time thing right now.

20:59.167 --> 21:00.293
Why did we stop?

21:01.125 --> 21:04.629
You know Mosquitos.
Bed-bugs. Fleas. Ticks...

21:04.917 --> 21:07.215
They're all vectors for disease, yes?

21:07.667 --> 21:11.843
But instead of spreading sickness,
why not change the formula?

21:12.375 --> 21:15.549
Make them carry genetically
modified viruses.

21:15.792 --> 21:17.669
Antigens to their own plague.

21:18.833 --> 21:22.337
Imagine releasing these in
the third world. In Africa...

21:23.792 --> 21:26.045
They're going to be bitten anyway.

21:26.583 --> 21:29.757
So why not let them catch
malaria vaccine instead?

21:31.500 --> 21:35.334
But then first you'd have to
invent the malaria vaccine, right?

21:38.167 --> 21:40.386
- You don't think it's possible?
- I didn't say that.

21:40.875 --> 21:44.084
- You know Stalin? Mao Tse-tung?
- Only by reputation.

21:44.250 --> 21:47.094
Both of them believed you
could transfer ideology

21:47.167 --> 21:50.626
by breeding one indoctrinated
generation to the next.

21:50.708 --> 21:55.088
And eventually you get
genetically-programmed Communists.

21:56.708 --> 21:59.837
I mean, I know this sounds
maybe a little bit crazy.

21:59.917 --> 22:03.342
But there were some
really good ideas in there.

22:04.542 --> 22:05.293
Huh?

22:08.208 --> 22:12.042
But look, um, what good ideas
are we talking about really?

22:12.208 --> 22:14.131
- You're not getting my point.
- What is your point?

22:14.208 --> 22:19.294
There is the idea, and there's
making people believe in the idea,

22:19.375 --> 22:21.423
and that is the key to
scientific freedom.

22:22.042 --> 22:23.168
And financing.

22:23.250 --> 22:27.881
Exactly, and you need that freedom
to be able to get the good ideas

22:27.958 --> 22:30.177
because they can come
from unexpected places.

22:30.875 --> 22:32.673
Like your son for example.

22:36.917 --> 22:40.751
You know,
I'm gonna walk from here.

22:59.042 --> 23:00.965
Say hello to Rebekka from me!

23:18.458 --> 23:21.337
So why didn't you call me?
I could have picked you up.

23:22.125 --> 23:24.048
I got a lift,

23:25.083 --> 23:29.714
well, sort of a half a lift from
that Jarek guy at the Institute.

23:33.458 --> 23:34.835
What's up with that guy?

23:37.667 --> 23:39.214
I don't have much to do with him.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.631
Don't you get enough
of these at work?

23:48.667 --> 23:50.385
I find them beautiful.

23:50.458 --> 23:54.634
You know, they're such
strange, resourceful organisms;

23:54.708 --> 23:56.551
there's nothing quite
like them on earth...

24:00.875 --> 24:02.172
You don't agree?

24:02.958 --> 24:05.507
I kinda always saw them as redundant.

24:05.583 --> 24:06.926
You know, genetic dead-ends.

24:09.583 --> 24:13.213
But then again after what
I saw today, who knows.

24:16.750 --> 24:17.842
What about this?

24:27.583 --> 24:29.085
They're called Wunderkammer.

24:29.750 --> 24:30.501
What?

24:30.625 --> 24:31.842
Wunderkammer.

24:32.292 --> 24:33.088
Wunderkammer...

24:33.167 --> 24:35.169
They were used in the old
days to display things

24:35.250 --> 24:36.877
that hadn't been classified yet.

24:37.083 --> 24:39.006
Now I'm creating new wonders.

24:39.625 --> 24:41.593
So you're an artist
now and a scientist?

24:45.542 --> 24:47.089
Come on, let's eat something.

24:48.708 --> 24:50.676
- Alright, go on.
- You're not in training, so...

24:50.750 --> 24:51.842
- Tell me.
- What?

24:51.917 --> 24:52.759
- Tell me!
- What!

24:52.833 --> 24:53.584
What do you think?

24:55.250 --> 24:56.467
Tell you what?

24:56.542 --> 24:59.796
About this Easter Gene of yours.
Why do you think I'm here?

25:01.000 --> 25:04.504
Okay, <i>I'll</i> tell you everything
on one condition. - Okay.

25:05.750 --> 25:07.468
You have to agree to work with me.

25:11.708 --> 25:16.214
Yeah, okay, sure.
To fruitful collaborations!

25:16.292 --> 25:18.795
Okay, that's good!
Because I need your brain.

25:19.083 --> 25:20.676
Just my brain...

25:24.750 --> 25:26.377
Alright, that was a little much.

25:28.708 --> 25:30.551
You had a big impact
on me, you know?

25:31.583 --> 25:32.425
Did I?

25:33.083 --> 25:37.293
You were this unreachable,
kind of, star scientist.

25:37.875 --> 25:39.969
Whatever.

25:40.042 --> 25:46.379
Intelligent and inspiring and
intimidating of course too sometimes.

25:46.458 --> 25:50.417
I mean even now, what you're
doing is brave I suppose.

25:52.083 --> 25:53.335
Why is that?

25:54.000 --> 25:55.547
- Forget about it...
- No, no, no!

25:55.625 --> 25:57.002
Think I'm a little drunk.

25:57.542 --> 25:58.714
You tell me.

26:00.542 --> 26:01.509
Just...

26:02.875 --> 26:04.548
Using your son like that.

26:04.958 --> 26:08.041
In the lecture... I can't imagine
what that must be like.

26:11.667 --> 26:14.261
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

26:14.333 --> 26:16.586
- I didn't mean to say that.
- Yeah, you did.

26:16.708 --> 26:18.460
Come on Geoff, I'm not criticizing you.

26:18.542 --> 26:21.512
You know, I haven't published
anything significant in four years.

26:22.833 --> 26:25.837
'Publish or perish', remember,
isn't that what we used to say?

26:30.167 --> 26:32.044
They were forcing me out of U-Mass.

26:33.417 --> 26:34.839
But you knew that, right?

26:35.833 --> 26:38.586
They were cutting my funding
until my lab was unworkable...

26:38.667 --> 26:40.089
waiting for me to quit.

26:40.250 --> 26:43.424
They couldn't fire me,
that would make them look bad.

26:45.792 --> 26:48.420
You know, my boy,
he was the only case.

26:49.542 --> 26:51.010
And it killed him.

26:58.458 --> 27:01.211
I'm just trying to find something
positive out of all this.

27:01.667 --> 27:05.297
You know, if I don't,
then what's the point?

27:09.292 --> 27:11.044
But you've made progress.

27:14.042 --> 27:15.294
I think I should go.

27:17.917 --> 27:20.921
You know, I'm still a little
tired, jetlagged. - Geoff...

27:21.000 --> 27:22.047
Dinner was nice.

27:26.833 --> 27:28.130
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

27:30.417 --> 27:31.213
Wait...

27:34.750 --> 27:37.833
You look nice, by the way.
See you tomorrow.

28:23.417 --> 28:24.919
No fucking idea...

29:22.333 --> 29:24.586
<i>Hi, it's Sarah, I'm not
available at the moment,</i>

29:24.667 --> 29:25.964
<i>but please leave a message.</i>

31:46.292 --> 31:47.088
Shit...

34:49.750 --> 34:51.092
So, where is it?

34:57.500 --> 34:58.922
Put it in the fridge.

35:09.292 --> 35:11.090
She'll notice if we take any more.

35:11.167 --> 35:12.840
She's got a whole rack of them.

35:12.917 --> 35:15.966
Anyway, we're doing her a favor.
Her research is a dead end.

35:16.042 --> 35:18.511
You're such a thoughtful guy.
So devoted to her...

35:18.583 --> 35:19.630
Fuck off.

35:19.958 --> 35:21.631
Pass me the next one.

35:22.458 --> 35:24.552
Come on,
there is no time for sleep!

35:25.500 --> 35:28.003
Okay wait, I have some
pussy remedy for you.

35:29.250 --> 35:32.174
One for me and one for you.

35:32.667 --> 35:34.340
Take it. Arrgghh.

35:35.417 --> 35:36.259
Okay.

35:42.125 --> 35:44.628
You know, Margaret Thatcher,
Iron Woman,

35:44.708 --> 35:46.927
she only sleeps
four hours a night.

35:47.042 --> 35:48.669
Huh, think about it.

35:50.125 --> 35:51.968
None of it was beauty-sleep.

35:52.625 --> 35:54.093
Very strong woman.

35:54.292 --> 35:55.214
I know that.

36:03.792 --> 36:07.092
I'm hungry.
I need to eat something.

36:07.875 --> 36:10.128
I'm hungry.
I need to eat something.

36:13.667 --> 36:15.886
Okay, let's make a break. Come on.

36:17.500 --> 36:18.547
Take it off.

36:31.375 --> 36:33.298
You know, Margaret Thatcher,

36:33.375 --> 36:35.423
she would sleep maybe
12 years in her life.

36:35.500 --> 36:40.176
Normal person, sleeping
25 years - you, 50.

38:14.792 --> 38:17.545
Oww! Son of a bitch...

38:56.500 --> 38:57.968
- Hello...
- Hello.

38:59.042 --> 39:00.544
What are you doing here?

39:01.167 --> 39:02.589
Just working late.

39:03.250 --> 39:04.718
In the mouse house?

39:05.167 --> 39:08.011
Is that where I am?
These hallways all look the same.

39:08.917 --> 39:10.339
Excuse me.

39:46.500 --> 39:47.467
What's wrong?

39:48.292 --> 39:49.384
I don't know.

39:53.875 --> 39:57.175
He's in pain, help him.

40:06.208 --> 40:08.210
He's in pain!

41:26.250 --> 41:27.843
What's he doing with you?

42:00.667 --> 42:02.385
Ah... Shit.

42:02.750 --> 42:03.546
I'm sorry.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.549
- Hey, Sunny, come on.
- Excuse me, excuse me.

42:39.625 --> 42:43.300
Do you know what an axolotl
says to another axolotl?

42:43.375 --> 42:44.376
I love your 'genes'.

42:49.042 --> 42:49.713
Yes?

42:50.542 --> 42:53.170
Ah, Geoffrey. Excellent timing.

42:53.292 --> 42:55.215
Come in, take a seat.

42:56.083 --> 42:58.427
Geoffrey Burton, Jarek Novak.

42:58.750 --> 43:01.048
Yes, ah, we've met.

43:01.250 --> 43:04.675
Jarek and Rebekka made the initial
breakthrough with the Easter Gene.

43:04.750 --> 43:06.252
I presume she's filled you in by now?

43:06.417 --> 43:07.634
Yeah... She mentioned it.

43:08.417 --> 43:12.968
Well, I'm sure Jarek here can
bring you up to speed. - Yes.

43:13.042 --> 43:14.794
You're staying at the
guesthouse, right?

43:16.000 --> 43:18.048
I can just pop by when it suits you.

43:18.917 --> 43:20.419
What is your room number?

43:20.500 --> 43:22.002
<i>I'll</i> just... I'll call you.

43:22.833 --> 43:24.676
- You have my number?
- No.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.718
I'm sure Samuel can help you.

43:37.583 --> 43:39.426
Don't mind him Geoffrey.
He means well.

43:39.500 --> 43:41.923
He just forgets, sometimes, that he's
not the only horse on the track.

43:43.458 --> 43:45.210
Yeah, but do you trust him?

43:46.708 --> 43:48.176
I trust all my staff.

43:52.250 --> 43:52.921
Yes?

43:57.125 --> 43:57.921
Thank you.

43:58.083 --> 43:59.209
Thank you very much.

44:02.208 --> 44:03.255
Bad news?

44:04.333 --> 44:07.052
No. Just the usual
administrative headaches.

44:07.250 --> 44:10.629
Our funders are very generous,
they allow us a good deal of latitude.

44:10.708 --> 44:12.255
But they're just so impatient.

44:12.333 --> 44:13.755
And that's where I come in?

44:13.833 --> 44:14.959
You're an asset
to our team, Geoffrey.

44:15.042 --> 44:17.136
You wouldn't be here if you weren't.

44:17.208 --> 44:20.542
But, I do admit, I hope you're excited
by what Jarek has to show you.

44:20.625 --> 44:23.003
Perhaps even enough to give him
the benefit of your expertise.

44:23.083 --> 44:25.051
You see, that's where
I'm still confused.

44:25.125 --> 44:27.298
I'm sorry, but are you asking
me to collaborate with both?

44:27.375 --> 44:28.342
Jarek and Rebekka?

44:28.500 --> 44:29.877
Well, that's up to you.

44:29.958 --> 44:32.552
I can hardly tell you to stop
your own research, after all

44:32.625 --> 44:34.343
that's why you're here.

44:34.417 --> 44:37.671
But you must admit, this is a
rather unique opportunity...

44:38.583 --> 44:42.213
See, I was under the impression
that this was Rebekka's project.

44:42.292 --> 44:44.135
That the Easter gene
was her discovery.

44:44.208 --> 44:48.293
You know scientists. Always bickering
over who did what when. - Yeah...

44:50.708 --> 44:57.296
Actually Geoffrey, just between you
and I, this is a bit of a tricky situation.

44:57.375 --> 45:00.219
Rebekka has refused to
collaborate with him any further.

45:00.292 --> 45:01.168
Yeah, why is that?

45:01.250 --> 45:03.799
I don't know. But I can hardly
throw him off the project.

45:05.167 --> 45:06.714
So what's he working on
down there?

45:06.792 --> 45:08.385
I've got him doing some genotyping.

45:08.458 --> 45:11.211
Tinkering away alone in the dark.
That's what suits him best...

45:11.292 --> 45:12.134
On mice?

45:12.208 --> 45:16.759
On Axolotls. He does have some
mice thing - his pet project.

45:16.833 --> 45:19.006
Viral vectors and so forth.

45:20.583 --> 45:24.918
Geoffrey, just meet with him...
I like to thaw him out sometimes.

45:26.583 --> 45:28.210
Is there something wrong?

45:29.083 --> 45:32.212
No. No, I'm just trying
to get my bearings, is all.

45:34.958 --> 45:37.256
- It's easier to work with zebra fish.
- Yeah, I know.

45:37.708 --> 45:39.005
- Hi, Sorry.
- Excuse me.

45:46.125 --> 45:48.093
I'm just finishing up some embryos

45:50.208 --> 45:53.633
It's so funny, I thought this morning,
we're like the yin and yang of mitosis.

45:53.958 --> 45:56.552
You work on cell proliferation
out of control: cancer.

45:56.625 --> 45:58.627
Me: on perfect cell harmony.

46:02.042 --> 46:03.965
So what's the story
with this Jarek guy?

46:04.125 --> 46:05.593
What do you mean?
What about him?

46:05.667 --> 46:09.968
I don't know. He just seems
kind of secretive. Kinda weird.

46:10.708 --> 46:13.257
I don't know. Samuel thinks
he's some kind of genius.

46:13.875 --> 46:15.092
And with you?

46:15.792 --> 46:17.009
What do you mean?

46:18.583 --> 46:20.335
Were you and he ever...?

46:22.542 --> 46:23.589
Are you joking?

46:24.958 --> 46:25.925
Just asking.

46:31.667 --> 46:33.135
So, what's he actually working on?

46:33.333 --> 46:36.587
I don't know what he's working on.
He doesn't want to tell me.

46:36.667 --> 46:38.044
To be honest I don't really care.

46:38.167 --> 46:40.215
Something related to the
Easter Gene maybe?

46:40.292 --> 46:40.963
Shit!

46:43.750 --> 46:45.218
Rebekka, Samuel told me.

46:45.750 --> 46:47.468
- Told you what?
- About the Easter Gene.

46:47.542 --> 46:49.089
It wasn't just your discovery, was it?

46:49.208 --> 46:51.131
- It's my discovery.
- But not yours alone.

46:51.500 --> 46:52.877
I'm not a liar, Geoff.

46:54.458 --> 46:57.132
Look, I just want to know what
you're getting me into here.

46:58.167 --> 46:59.635
You say we're working together. Fine.

46:59.708 --> 47:02.427
But I don't even know
whose research it is anymore.

47:02.500 --> 47:03.797
I don't even know who's involved.

47:04.125 --> 47:05.843
Jarek isn't involved
in what I'm doing.

47:05.917 --> 47:06.543
But you did work with him.

47:06.625 --> 47:08.753
Only briefly,
in the very early stages.

47:08.833 --> 47:10.961
I didn't like his style.
He was too reckless.

47:11.042 --> 47:14.012
He tried to dominate my project.
I threatened to quit

47:14.083 --> 47:16.802
if Samuel didn't take him off.
In the end I won.

47:16.875 --> 47:18.343
According to Samuel he's still on it.

47:18.500 --> 47:19.592
It's cosmetic.

47:29.500 --> 47:30.752
You might want to see this.

47:35.667 --> 47:37.920
- Where did you get this?
- I 'retrieved' it from

47:38.000 --> 47:40.048
the mouse house and I suggest
you change your locks.

47:40.333 --> 47:41.380
What do you mean?

47:41.458 --> 47:44.712
Jarek's got a clandestine lab set up.
And I'm, yeah, I'm pretty damn

47:44.792 --> 47:47.136
sure he's trialing your
Easter Gene on mice.

47:50.917 --> 47:52.339
What do you want to do about it?

47:54.042 --> 47:55.339
- I'll deal with it.
- How?

47:55.417 --> 47:56.714
- I'll talk to Samuel.
- Why?

47:56.792 --> 47:58.590
- Why don't we just confront him?
- It won't help.

48:01.333 --> 48:02.425
It's my research, okay?

48:02.500 --> 48:03.797
I want to deal with it my way.

48:05.333 --> 48:06.425
You have to trust me.

48:09.292 --> 48:10.043
Okay.

49:31.542 --> 49:32.964
Do something, Geoff, help him.

49:34.417 --> 49:36.966
I'll take care of it, okay? I'll fix it.

50:04.833 --> 50:06.676
I'm just going to take
a little bit of blood...

51:02.542 --> 51:03.418
Just a minute!

51:26.000 --> 51:26.466
Hi.

51:29.500 --> 51:31.002
What's with the gloves?

51:31.458 --> 51:34.337
I'm doing some dishes.

51:36.167 --> 51:37.669
What are you doing here?

51:38.458 --> 51:39.926
I'm taking you to the party.

51:40.708 --> 51:41.459
What party?

51:41.667 --> 51:43.010
Haven't you seen the signs?

51:43.167 --> 51:43.668
No.

51:43.833 --> 51:45.335
It's our big annua...

51:45.875 --> 51:47.502
- Annual.
- Annual get-together.

51:47.583 --> 51:49.585
You have to come.
Everybody will be there.

51:51.417 --> 51:52.418
I don't think so.

51:54.958 --> 51:57.086
You have no choice.
You're my date.

51:59.458 --> 52:01.005
Looks like you got started early.

52:02.750 --> 52:03.842
Is that wrong?

52:05.167 --> 52:05.633
No.

52:08.250 --> 52:09.877
- You want some more?
- Bitte.

52:10.333 --> 52:10.925
What?

52:11.542 --> 52:13.544
You know what that means, 'bitte'?

52:14.167 --> 52:14.713
No.

52:14.917 --> 52:16.089
Yeah, I thought so.

52:21.375 --> 52:23.093
So, what's up
with the trench coat?

52:25.000 --> 52:26.001
Holy shit.

52:27.458 --> 52:31.292
It's an axolotl! Don't you get it?
Me the axolotl woman.

52:36.292 --> 52:37.635
Right... cos?

52:38.083 --> 52:39.960
- It's a costume party!
- I see.

52:41.583 --> 52:43.460
- Come on! I have an idea for you.
- Oh God...

52:43.542 --> 52:44.919
Come, come on.

52:46.625 --> 52:48.172
Oh, sorry.

52:49.667 --> 52:51.635
This is insane. This guy's
trying to steal your research.

52:51.708 --> 52:54.052
Geoff, I, you know, I don't
want to create a fuss. Okay?

52:54.125 --> 52:55.672
I know how to handle Jarek.

52:56.042 --> 52:57.669
It has to be done discreetly.

53:00.750 --> 53:02.593
Listen to me. I know what I saw...

53:02.917 --> 53:05.090
They were fully grown mice.
Not embryos!

53:05.167 --> 53:06.794
Geoff. Please. Can you just...

53:06.875 --> 53:09.799
Can you just leave it,
just for tonight? Please!

53:09.875 --> 53:13.925
I want to have some fun...
feel human for a change.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.968
Please. Okay?

53:16.958 --> 53:17.880
Just tonight.

53:18.458 --> 53:20.586
One night? Promise?

53:23.000 --> 53:24.923
- Promise.
- Now, hold still...

53:27.708 --> 53:28.960
One more thing.

53:44.750 --> 53:45.592
Just wait.

53:46.833 --> 53:49.256
What? You know it's not Boston.

53:49.333 --> 53:52.337
I'm not your intern anymore.
You don't have to feel guilty.

53:55.042 --> 53:56.510
Why did you bring me here?

54:02.625 --> 54:03.501
Hold still.

54:04.625 --> 54:06.969
Was it for work? Or was it
to start something again?

54:10.917 --> 54:12.464
What if I said both?

54:15.375 --> 54:17.844
Then I'd say,
it's not a very good idea.

54:21.542 --> 54:26.252
Look, its, its not that I don't
think you're attractive. I do.

54:28.375 --> 54:30.218
It just feels too...

54:32.042 --> 54:32.918
Yeah, okay.

54:34.667 --> 54:35.714
You're finished.

54:38.542 --> 54:40.419
- Rebekka!
- Here, put that on.

54:40.625 --> 54:42.218
I'll go warm up the car.

55:12.833 --> 55:13.550
Hey!

55:19.792 --> 55:21.135
Oh, there they are!

55:21.667 --> 55:22.293
Hi!

55:29.917 --> 55:32.090
Hey! You look great!

55:34.167 --> 55:35.635
Have you both met?

55:36.333 --> 55:37.300
I dunno.

55:47.458 --> 55:49.051
I need a drink.
Do you want anything?

56:07.417 --> 56:09.761
They dream...
Did you know that?

56:11.542 --> 56:15.752
When Drosophila lose contact
from the ground, they fly.

56:15.833 --> 56:19.713
It is instinct. So, we put
them in a flight simulator

56:19.792 --> 56:23.467
and blow banana wind
- smell of banana - at them;

56:23.667 --> 56:26.295
eventually they sleep
from exhaustion.

56:26.375 --> 56:29.834
Yet we still detect brain
activity from olfactory bulbs,

56:29.917 --> 56:33.672
representing the pattern,
reaction, to banana smell.

56:34.000 --> 56:38.176
Which means: sleeping fruit
fly dream of banana...

56:44.250 --> 56:45.877
Are you her new boyfriend?

57:29.583 --> 57:31.585
Think you'll get
lucky tonight, huh?

57:32.958 --> 57:34.551
You've been there before, right?

57:35.333 --> 57:36.960
Professor's privilege...

57:47.167 --> 57:49.841
And by the way,
I want my mouse back.

57:51.167 --> 57:53.215
- Your mouse?
- Yes, my mouse.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.126
Give me one good reason

57:56.208 --> 57:58.506
why I just don't go to Samuel
and tell him what you're up to?

57:59.458 --> 58:01.176
- What I'm up to...?
- Yeah.

58:02.708 --> 58:04.881
Tell me, what am I up to?

58:05.708 --> 58:08.757
Well, I know you've stolen
Rebekka's research.

58:08.833 --> 58:11.302
And I saw your stupid
lapdog break into her lab.

58:11.708 --> 58:14.552
There is no 'her research'
or 'my research', Geoff.

58:14.958 --> 58:19.885
We're just one big organism.
Didn't Samuel tell you that? No?

58:25.333 --> 58:28.542
Well, you see that would make
your mouse our mouse then.

58:29.458 --> 58:30.755
And our mouse tells me that

58:30.833 --> 58:33.382
you've been trialing the
Easter Gene on mammals.

58:35.208 --> 58:38.963
And I also know that it's working.
What I don't know is how you did it.

58:40.167 --> 58:43.671
So go on, tell me how you did it!

58:45.875 --> 58:46.592
Come on.

58:47.083 --> 58:49.552
I guess you'll have to
wait and read my paper.

58:49.917 --> 58:51.260
Like everybody else.

58:51.542 --> 58:52.293
Tell me!

59:11.542 --> 59:12.839
Do you need a doctor?

59:13.333 --> 59:16.462
It's his own fault. Fuck him. Come.

59:34.167 --> 59:35.134
Hello!

59:36.042 --> 59:36.964
Hello!

01:00:00.125 --> 01:00:01.593
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:00:14.208 --> 01:00:16.427
It's going to need
some serious stitches.

01:00:40.917 --> 01:00:41.964
You okay?

01:00:57.583 --> 01:00:58.175
<i>He'! -</i>

01:01:03.292 --> 01:01:03.918
What?

01:01:31.208 --> 01:01:31.800
No!

01:01:32.208 --> 01:01:34.381
No! No! No!

01:03:18.917 --> 01:03:20.385
Geoff, what are you doing?

01:03:39.667 --> 01:03:41.340
Let's make it right...

01:04:07.125 --> 01:04:08.217
You're awake?

01:04:12.542 --> 01:04:15.091
Your fever's gone.
You really scared me last night.

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:19.002
What are you doing?

01:04:19.083 --> 01:04:20.630
It's quite a dossier you have here.

01:04:20.792 --> 01:04:22.510
You always go
through people's stuff?

01:04:23.083 --> 01:04:25.461
If you didn't want me to see it,
why's it just lying around?

01:04:27.583 --> 01:04:32.293
You know, I saw Jarek at the club.
We had a nice little chat... - Why?

01:04:32.375 --> 01:04:33.922
- Why did you do that?
- Why not?

01:04:35.542 --> 01:04:40.002
I saw him grab you. I saw you
talking to him last night after work.

01:04:44.333 --> 01:04:45.710
That's what I thought.

01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:49.632
So what! What do you want
me to say? - The truth.

01:04:50.417 --> 01:04:53.842
Okay, I had a little fling with Jarek.
So what? it was stupid.

01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:57.050
So stupid...

01:04:58.542 --> 01:05:02.251
At least I knew who I was fucking.
You called me Sarah last night.

01:05:04.208 --> 01:05:06.302
I was delirious. What's your excuse?

01:05:06.792 --> 01:05:08.214
Why do I need one?

01:05:09.625 --> 01:05:12.925
Listen, I don't care if you were
sleeping with some freak.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.298
What I do care about is everything
you've been telling me lately

01:05:15.375 --> 01:05:16.171
sounds like bullshit.

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:17.376
- Bullshit?
- Bullshit.

01:05:17.458 --> 01:05:19.802
Okay then, let's just define
'bullshit' for a moment, shall we?

01:05:19.917 --> 01:05:22.591
What's bullshit is that you
were never going to leave her.

01:05:22.667 --> 01:05:24.010
Despite everything you told me.

01:05:24.083 --> 01:05:25.426
I never said anything that
would make you think...

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:29.084
You think that didn't hurt?
I was frightened.

01:05:29.167 --> 01:05:31.511
You know, it wasn't just some
little crush on my professor...

01:05:31.583 --> 01:05:35.042
I was scared that it could get
out and my career would suffer.

01:05:35.917 --> 01:05:38.636
That was a long time ago,
you need to move on.

01:05:38.792 --> 01:05:39.418
Get out.

01:05:42.625 --> 01:05:43.592
Get out!

01:05:54.667 --> 01:05:58.171
You know, you have no idea
what I've had to deal with.

01:05:58.375 --> 01:06:01.959
Oh, come on, Geoff! Deal with!
You haven't dealt with anything.

01:06:17.792 --> 01:06:18.384
Sarah?

01:06:18.917 --> 01:06:22.547
<i>Ah, she's not available
right now. Is this Geoff?</i>

01:06:22.667 --> 01:06:24.044
Just put my wife on, please.

01:06:24.167 --> 01:06:26.886
<i>She's not your wife anymore.
She doesn't want to talk to you.</i>

01:06:26.958 --> 01:06:28.005
Yes, she does.

01:06:28.208 --> 01:06:30.461
<i>Every time you call you upset her.</i>

01:06:30.542 --> 01:06:32.135
- <i>I'm sick of it!</i>
- <i>Just put her on,</i> Ben!

01:06:34.167 --> 01:06:35.464
Hey, who the fuck!

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.547
Oh, you fucking...

01:07:50.917 --> 01:07:51.884
Squek...

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:34.636
Come on! Answer the phone!

01:09:49.957 --> 01:09:51.005
Where's Rebekka?

01:09:52.417 --> 01:09:53.464
Up on the roof.

01:10:06.917 --> 01:10:07.634
Hi...

01:10:15.875 --> 01:10:17.422
I need your help.

01:10:24.458 --> 01:10:26.085
Rebekka... Please.

01:10:31.042 --> 01:10:33.966
- What is it you want from me?
- I can't tell you here.

01:10:35.917 --> 01:10:36.509
Here!

01:10:41.542 --> 01:10:43.010
- I need you...
- Geoff!

01:10:43.167 --> 01:10:45.169
- ...to do a blood test.
- Yeah, of course.

01:10:45.333 --> 01:10:47.006
- You can run a PCR, right?
- Yeah.

01:10:51.833 --> 01:10:54.632
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

01:10:55.917 --> 01:10:56.588
Help me.

01:10:56.792 --> 01:10:58.886
Can you please just tell me what's
going on? You're scaring me!

01:10:58.958 --> 01:10:59.880
I was bitten by a mouse!

01:11:00.083 --> 01:11:01.460
- A lab mouse?
- Yes.

01:11:01.667 --> 01:11:03.510
And I'm pretty sure
I've contracted a virus.

01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:04.714
That's not possible.

01:11:04.792 --> 01:11:07.170
These are the most
pathogen-free mice in the world.

01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:08.968
Not if they belong to Jarek.

01:11:09.042 --> 01:11:11.010
Now come on, we need a sample from
you too for the negative control.

01:11:11.083 --> 01:11:12.676
- I know how it works, Geoff.
- Then do it!

01:11:12.958 --> 01:11:14.835
What am I supposed
to be looking for?

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.297
Your Easter Gene.

01:11:17.708 --> 01:11:21.793
Jarek's using a viral vector to
integrate it into the mammal genome.

01:11:21.875 --> 01:11:24.628
Not embryos - fully grown mice.

01:11:24.708 --> 01:11:27.382
He scooped you on the mammals, I'm
sorry he did it, but I don't know how.

01:11:28.292 --> 01:11:29.043
What?

01:11:30.708 --> 01:11:31.834
I'm the proof.

01:11:34.917 --> 01:11:36.635
You know what, you're right.

01:11:37.542 --> 01:11:38.839
Screw the test!

01:11:41.167 --> 01:11:42.669
- Where are you going?
- Where's Jarek?

01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:44.468
- I don't know.
- Yes you do!

01:11:44.542 --> 01:11:46.795
- Probably in the mouse house.
- The mouse house?

01:11:47.417 --> 01:11:49.294
- What are you doing?
- What do you think.

01:11:53.458 --> 01:11:55.802
Please. Let me call Samuel.

01:11:55.917 --> 01:11:57.419
Oh, now you're gonna call him!

01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.218
Call Samuel, get him to the
mouse house right now.

01:12:03.583 --> 01:12:05.256
- Let's think about this.
- I'm done thinking!

01:12:05.333 --> 01:12:06.585
Where are you going? Stop!

01:12:07.042 --> 01:12:09.090
- Geoff!
- Squeak is spelt with an 'A', asshole!

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.468
- What are you doing?
- You used a viral vector.

01:12:14.875 --> 01:12:16.752
- Get off him!
- Come on!

01:12:18.208 --> 01:12:20.256
- It was infectious!
- What are you talking about?

01:12:20.333 --> 01:12:22.131
You're mouse, it was infectious!

01:12:22.292 --> 01:12:24.636
- Get this crazy asshole off me!
- Tell me!

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.002
Stop it! Please!

01:12:29.208 --> 01:12:30.755
I'm going to fucking
kill you! Get off me.

01:12:31.292 --> 01:12:31.918
Jarek!

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:34.842
Get back!

01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:37.626
- Jarek.
- Get back.

01:12:38.333 --> 01:12:39.175
Jarek.

01:12:39.875 --> 01:12:42.173
What's wrong, Jarek?

01:12:42.250 --> 01:12:44.173
This is exactly what
you wanted, wasn't it?

01:12:45.417 --> 01:12:46.293
Get back!

01:12:47.208 --> 01:12:48.425
What are you going to do?

01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:49.967
I mean it.

01:12:50.625 --> 01:12:51.342
Do it.

01:12:53.333 --> 01:12:55.301
- Get back!
- What the hell is going on here?

01:12:55.417 --> 01:12:57.215
He just went crazy,
he was attacking us!

01:12:57.292 --> 01:12:59.294
Don't listen to him, Samuel!
These guys infected me!

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:01.878
That's a lie. He's done it to
himself. Waldemar, tell him.

01:13:01.958 --> 01:13:03.631
- Bullshit.
- It's true. He did.

01:13:03.708 --> 01:13:04.675
They lured me here.

01:13:05.208 --> 01:13:08.633
In fact you all lured me
and you used the mouse

01:13:08.708 --> 01:13:10.927
to infect me and make
it look unintentional.

01:13:11.458 --> 01:13:13.005
Put that scalpel down.

01:13:13.333 --> 01:13:15.006
Put the scalpel down!

01:13:18.042 --> 01:13:19.385
Look at his head.

01:13:20.417 --> 01:13:21.339
The cut.

01:13:22.292 --> 01:13:23.589
- What cut?
- Shit.

01:13:24.917 --> 01:13:27.887
Will someone kindly tell me
what the hell this is all about?

01:13:28.042 --> 01:13:29.339
It's healed...

01:13:29.875 --> 01:13:32.344
It works. It works in humans!

01:13:36.792 --> 01:13:38.169
You fucking back off!

01:13:38.458 --> 01:13:40.426
Alright, I see what's going on now.

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.673
I understand your little
collaboration, right? - Geoffrey...

01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:45.094
No, I get it now.
You're in on this, too!

01:13:46.125 --> 01:13:48.844
What is this 'infection'? Is it viral?

01:13:49.167 --> 01:13:51.295
Of course it's fucking viral.

01:13:51.375 --> 01:13:54.925
The Easter Gene is an
endogenous retro virus.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.298
Even though these two
geniuses couldn't work it out.

01:13:58.542 --> 01:13:59.759
Is this true?

01:14:03.208 --> 01:14:04.551
What the hell have you done?

01:14:04.958 --> 01:14:06.130
What I have done?

01:14:06.250 --> 01:14:08.673
I've just made the
discovery of the century!

01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:12.084
This is what I have done.
Me, Jarek Novak. Remember it.

01:14:17.083 --> 01:14:18.175
Happy Easter.

01:14:20.667 --> 01:14:21.338
Yeah,

01:14:23.583 --> 01:14:26.086
discovery's not a cure, right?

01:14:27.583 --> 01:14:29.051
That's what you told me.

01:14:30.875 --> 01:14:34.630
If the healing's accelerated,
so has the tumorgenesis.

01:14:34.708 --> 01:14:37.461
What do you think I got?
A day? Maybe two?

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.297
Is this contagious?

01:14:43.625 --> 01:14:45.252
Ah, it's alright, Samuel.

01:14:46.042 --> 01:14:48.215
I'm pretty god damn sure
that it's blood-borne.

01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:53.503
No, Geoff, no!

01:14:57.708 --> 01:14:58.755
No, please!

01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:06.502
Let me go! Please!

01:15:09.083 --> 01:15:11.051
No, please!

01:15:12.583 --> 01:15:13.960
Let me go!

01:15:14.167 --> 01:15:15.794
Please! Geoff!

01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:17.217
Geoff!

01:15:17.583 --> 01:15:19.005
Let me go! Please!

01:15:25.708 --> 01:15:27.881
I'm not going to be
anybody's specimen.

01:15:43.958 --> 01:15:44.675
Geoff!

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:46.717
Geoff!

01:15:50.583 --> 01:15:51.300
Geoff!

01:15:53.542 --> 01:15:54.088
Geoff!

01:15:56.167 --> 01:15:57.464
Geoff, please stop!

01:15:58.500 --> 01:15:59.501
Stop please.

01:15:59.625 --> 01:16:00.217
Geoff!

01:16:01.583 --> 01:16:02.379
Stop!

01:16:06.292 --> 01:16:07.464
There's nothing you can do.

01:16:07.542 --> 01:16:09.044
Come back with me,
it's your only chance.

01:16:09.167 --> 01:16:11.420
No. I'm going home.

01:16:14.625 --> 01:16:21.008
Listen, I made a few changes in the
sequence, but it's basically the same.

01:16:25.083 --> 01:16:25.709
Same?

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:26.626
Yeah.

01:16:28.208 --> 01:16:30.381
- The same as what?
- Burton's Syndrome.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:33.626
What?

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:37.217
What?

01:16:40.042 --> 01:16:45.970
I requested tissue samples when I
heard about your son's condition.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.001
<i>My son?</i>

01:16:53.167 --> 01:16:56.011
Why? Why would you do that?

01:16:56.292 --> 01:17:00.968
I thought I could help
you somehow. I...

01:17:01.625 --> 01:17:03.002
I don't...

01:17:03.125 --> 01:17:05.594
You know, when I started
cloning the gene,

01:17:05.667 --> 01:17:08.420
I discovered it could
regenerate dying cells.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:12.459
I mean the tumors are actually a
symptom of cell regeneration.

01:17:12.542 --> 01:17:15.341
It's regeneration out of control.
That's what happened to your son.

01:17:17.292 --> 01:17:19.636
I wanted you here to share it.

01:17:19.708 --> 01:17:22.837
To show it to you,
to make you part of it...

01:17:22.917 --> 01:17:24.965
I mean, you are part of it.

01:17:26.583 --> 01:17:28.585
I wanted to tell you. I just...

01:17:29.167 --> 01:17:31.261
I was waiting for the right time.

01:17:32.125 --> 01:17:33.718
What took you so long, huh?

01:17:34.125 --> 01:17:38.380
I was afraid to tell you. I didn't
know how you'd react or...

01:17:40.083 --> 01:17:43.087
I'm sorry, I went too far with it. I'm...

01:17:45.875 --> 01:17:46.376
Why?

01:17:46.458 --> 01:17:47.425
Because...

01:17:47.625 --> 01:17:48.091
Why?

01:17:48.208 --> 01:17:52.167
Because I love you, Geoff.
Don't you see that? I love you.

01:17:55.167 --> 01:17:56.259
You love me.

01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:05.798
I'm so sorry...

01:18:06.042 --> 01:18:08.170
- No, it's fine...
- I never meant for this to happen.

01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:14.593
I have my own disease.

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:21.925
You know how funny that is?
I have my own disease.

01:18:22.958 --> 01:18:25.962
It was just research to help you.

01:18:26.792 --> 01:18:28.044
'Research'...

01:18:36.708 --> 01:18:39.302
That's exactly what I
would say to Sarah.

01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:52.467
Geoff!

01:18:52.833 --> 01:18:53.550
Geoff!

01:18:55.208 --> 01:18:55.879
Geoff!

01:18:57.042 --> 01:18:58.794
Geoff, where are you going?

01:19:02.667 --> 01:19:03.418
Geoff!

01:20:05.875 --> 01:20:07.343
Yeah. That's alright!

01:20:09.875 --> 01:20:12.924
You're drooling again!

01:20:14.083 --> 01:20:15.209
Son of a...

01:20:15.542 --> 01:20:16.543
Bitch.

01:20:17.208 --> 01:20:18.004
Hey!

01:20:18.792 --> 01:20:20.214
What are you doing?

01:20:20.458 --> 01:20:21.254
Hey!

01:20:22.125 --> 01:20:22.967
Hey!

01:20:26.083 --> 01:20:26.675
Oh...

01:20:27.833 --> 01:20:28.834
Okay...

01:24:01.167 --> 01:24:02.919
Please open the door.

01:24:06.417 --> 01:24:08.044
Please come out.

01:24:15.333 --> 01:24:16.710
Have you got a ticket?

01:24:17.250 --> 01:24:17.921
Ticket?

01:24:23.875 --> 01:24:24.592
Ticket?

01:24:25.667 --> 01:24:27.135
You speak English?

01:24:28.458 --> 01:24:29.755
Do you speak English?

01:24:32.042 --> 01:24:32.838
Hey!

01:24:37.292 --> 01:24:37.963
Stop!

01:24:38.833 --> 01:24:40.176
Please stop.

01:24:42.083 --> 01:24:43.005
Please stop!

01:27:12.833 --> 01:27:15.427
<i>Hi, ifs Sarah, I'm not
available at the moment.</i>

01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:17.093
<i>Please</i> leave a message
after the beep.

01:27:17.458 --> 01:27:18.425
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:27:20.625 --> 01:27:21.922
I'm sorry.

01:27:35.833 --> 01:27:38.382
I loved him so much.

01:27:39.250 --> 01:27:41.298
And it was just hard...

01:27:42.542 --> 01:27:45.967
I did love him, I really did.

01:27:48.375 --> 01:27:49.797
I really did.

01:32:28.333 --> 01:32:29.550
Where is she?

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:31.592
Yeah?

01:32:31.833 --> 01:32:33.426
Where is she?

01:33:29.458 --> 01:33:30.254
Geoffrey.

01:33:31.583 --> 01:33:32.755
You're awake.

01:33:36.750 --> 01:33:38.593
Well, at least you've
got your own room.

01:33:39.708 --> 01:33:42.211
No, no. No, don't do that.

01:33:42.958 --> 01:33:46.258
You've been very restless
these past few days.

01:33:47.125 --> 01:33:48.593
But don't you worry.

01:33:49.042 --> 01:33:51.670
Everything is being
thoroughly investigated.

01:33:53.708 --> 01:33:54.379
Geoffrey.

01:33:56.875 --> 01:33:58.627
You have been very ill,

01:33:59.750 --> 01:34:01.627
but you're all better now.

01:34:02.250 --> 01:34:04.344
Your recovery has been remarkable...

01:34:05.167 --> 01:34:07.010
Inspirational, in fact.

01:34:08.542 --> 01:34:10.465
Do you remember anything?

01:34:12.542 --> 01:34:13.634
Where is she?

01:34:13.792 --> 01:34:16.136
She's right here. Look.

01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:22.092
No.

01:34:22.292 --> 01:34:23.293
Sarah.

01:34:26.417 --> 01:34:27.919
Listen, old chap.

01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:31.219
We're going to have to
keep you in here for a bit.

01:34:32.542 --> 01:34:34.590
You're unique, you see?

01:34:35.792 --> 01:34:38.636
But just at the moment,
you're a bit of a danger to yourself.

01:34:40.708 --> 01:34:43.917
But don't worry.
You'll be all right.

01:35:18.167 --> 01:35:18.963
Hey...

01:35:26.917 --> 01:35:29.670
You were really sick,
but you're good now.

01:35:31.458 --> 01:35:32.710
You're immune.

01:35:35.875 --> 01:35:36.922
Look at this.

01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:41.502
Do you see that?

01:35:49.333 --> 01:35:50.585
Jarek was right.

01:35:52.083 --> 01:35:54.882
Burton's Syndrome is actually
a dormant retrovirus.

01:35:55.583 --> 01:35:59.793
We all have it,
it's millions of years old.

01:36:01.042 --> 01:36:03.761
Only that your son had a
very special version of it.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.377
And now you.

01:36:07.917 --> 01:36:09.385
You're a miracle.

01:36:10.875 --> 01:36:13.048
And your son was a miracle.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.968
Why didn't your son recover?

01:36:42.208 --> 01:36:44.631
Excuse me, I need to
take some blood.

01:37:04.792 --> 01:37:06.760
How was I supposed to know?
