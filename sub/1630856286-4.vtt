THE WATCHER: <i>The Guardians</i>
<i>of the Multiverse.</i>

00:14.708 --> 00:17.833
<i>Heroes plucked</i>
<i>from across different realities</i>

00:17.916 --> 00:19.958
<i>to protect the fate of all of them.</i>

00:21.375 --> 00:23.458
<i>But you don't know her story.</i>

00:24.208 --> 00:28.500
<i>From the daughter of a Mad Titan</i>
<i>to the champion of a multiversal war,</i>

00:28.625 --> 00:32.083
<i>Gamora's path</i>
<i>to becoming the hero of her story</i>

00:32.458 --> 00:34.500
<i>began in someone else's.</i>

00:40.708 --> 00:41.916
<i>Time.</i>

00:44.958 --> 00:45.958
<i>Space.</i>

00:47.833 --> 00:48.833
<i>Reality.</i>

00:51.708 --> 00:53.500
<i>It's more than a linear path.</i>

00:58.333 --> 01:02.833
<i>It's a prism of endless possibility,</i>

01:05.166 --> 01:08.958
<i>where a single choice</i>
<i>can branch out into infinite realities,</i>

01:11.625 --> 01:14.416
<i>creating alternate worlds</i>
<i>from the ones you know.</i>

01:18.375 --> 01:19.625
<i>I am the Watcher.</i>

01:21.875 --> 01:25.208
<i>I am your guide</i>
<i>through these vast new realities.</i>

01:26.791 --> 01:30.416
<i>Follow me and ponder the question...</i>

01:33.875 --> 01:35.208
<i>"What if?"</i>

01:39.166 --> 01:40.416
IRON MAN: <i>Pepper...</i>

01:42.083 --> 01:44.291
THE WATCHER: <i>With his home</i>
<i>on the verge of destruction,</i>

01:44.375 --> 01:48.291
<i>Tony Stark, self-made Iron Man,</i>
<i>made the ultimate hero's play.</i>

01:53.833 --> 01:57.416
<i>But in this universe,</i>
<i>Tony never made it home.</i>

02:06.500 --> 02:08.000
Whoa!

02:10.791 --> 02:12.208
(GRUNTS)

02:13.416 --> 02:15.125
Oh, crap. I'm dead.

02:15.583 --> 02:17.125
Okay, this can't be heaven.

02:17.208 --> 02:19.166
Um, tell me you're not God.

02:21.208 --> 02:22.416
Hey.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.875
Look. Who is this handsome dog?

02:24.958 --> 02:26.958
Look at that radiant skin.

02:27.041 --> 02:29.875
I call you "Porcelana. <i>Se√±or</i> Porcelana."

02:30.166 --> 02:31.875
Okay.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.791
- Whoa!
- Uh-oh. Fire. Topaz, the foam.

02:35.875 --> 02:37.333
Release the foam.

02:40.833 --> 02:42.500
Okay, we got it good.

02:42.583 --> 02:45.916
I think it was overkill with the foam.
But look. He's still smoldering.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.083
Uh, no, this is hell. I've gone to hell.

02:48.166 --> 02:51.666
Oh, tsk, tsk, my new friend,
this is the planet of Sakaar.

02:51.750 --> 02:54.833
I'm sorry. "Planet"?
As in, "I'm lost in space"?

02:54.916 --> 02:58.958
Uh, yes. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. It's you.

02:59.041 --> 03:00.583
This is you. This is you.

03:00.666 --> 03:01.750
This is the guy.

03:01.833 --> 03:05.416
Mr. Metal Mojo Man is in the palace.

03:05.500 --> 03:08.125
- Uh, "Iron Man."
- Crusher of the Chitaurinos.

03:08.208 --> 03:09.833
- The defeater of Thanos.
- Who?

03:09.916 --> 03:12.000
And provocateur with the facial hair.

03:12.083 --> 03:14.541
I like what you're doing
with the chin decoration there.

03:14.625 --> 03:16.958
- Do we know each other?
- Time works differently here.

03:17.041 --> 03:18.083
We've been talking about

03:18.166 --> 03:22.250
Mr. Metal Mojo Man's
nuclear ride for days.

03:22.333 --> 03:24.166
- By the way, can I call you "Mojo"?
- Never.

03:24.250 --> 03:26.625
- No? Possibly "Tin Man"?
- No.

03:26.708 --> 03:27.791
- "Rocket Man"?
- Nope.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.625
"Mojo Man" it is. Okay, there you go.

03:32.291 --> 03:33.916
Ah! We won. Good.

03:35.958 --> 03:37.125
Oh, my God. Pepper.

03:37.916 --> 03:40.958
She's okay. She's okay. Okay.

03:41.041 --> 03:42.166
Mojo.

03:42.250 --> 03:45.791
Hey, quick. Do that thing you do.
You know, the thing. Do the thing.

03:45.875 --> 03:48.625
Okay, Wizard of Oz,
I need to get back to the Earth pronto.

03:48.708 --> 03:50.750
- Can you help me with that?
- Sure. Of course.

03:50.833 --> 03:52.750
I'll get you on a zoom.
You know, the zoom.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.291
But first, you gotta stay
and celebrate with us.

03:55.375 --> 03:56.666
It's my 21st.

03:56.875 --> 03:58.000
- 21st what?
- Birthday.

03:58.083 --> 04:01.250
I know, I know.
I don't look a day over 18, but...

04:01.333 --> 04:03.666
Thanks, but I've kind of
put my party days behind me.

04:03.750 --> 04:05.583
So, spaceship? Is it that way?

04:05.666 --> 04:06.666
Topaz.

04:11.583 --> 04:13.875
Um, will there be food?

04:18.208 --> 04:19.416

<i>Hey, look at you all.</i>
<i>Gussied up. Wearing your best.</i>

04:31.875 --> 04:34.708
<i>Well, look, I could chit-chat all day.</i>
<i>I get gabby.</i>

04:34.791 --> 04:39.958
<i>But we're here to celebrate two things,</i>
<i>me and Sakaar Grand Prix.</i>

04:50.875 --> 04:57.125
<i>So let's make some noise for our Dollies</i>
<i>and Clydes, our racers and drivers.</i>

04:57.333 --> 05:01.833
<i>On your marks. Get set.</i>

05:03.041 --> 05:08.541
<i>And... Hang on. Don't jump the gun.</i>

05:09.958 --> 05:12.375
<i>Not yet. Not yet.</i>

05:20.041 --> 05:21.791
<i>Wait.</i>

05:27.000 --> 05:29.750
<i>Get out of here, you crazy kids.</i>

(SINGING) <i>It's my birthday</i>
<i>It's my birthday</i>

05:42.708 --> 05:44.625
- That tastes like a dog park.
- Boo!

05:44.708 --> 05:48.666
Surprise. It's me.
Didn't mean to spook you.

05:48.750 --> 05:50.583
Or did I? I did. I did.

05:50.666 --> 05:52.416
Isn't this quaint? You know, on Yurth...

05:52.500 --> 05:53.583
- "Earth."
- "Oorth"?

05:53.666 --> 05:54.833
- "Earth."
- "Arfff"?

05:55.875 --> 05:57.791
- Yep, you got it. Nailed it.
- Yeah.

05:57.875 --> 05:59.791
Well, this would be called a chariot race.

05:59.875 --> 06:02.000
- Formula 1 race.
- No, these are chariots.

06:02.083 --> 06:03.250
See the drivers? The wheels?

06:03.333 --> 06:05.125
(ENGINES REVVING)

06:05.208 --> 06:06.708
Yeah, this is intergalactic NASCAR.

06:08.833 --> 06:11.166
Race cars are similar, but very different.

06:11.250 --> 06:13.583
- Common mistake. Don't be embarrassed.
- (CRASHING)

06:20.750 --> 06:23.875
I told them to get bigger gas tanks.
I barely felt that flame.

06:55.541 --> 06:56.916
(CHEERING)

06:57.375 --> 07:00.333
Wow! Well, a fitting end for...
Who was that?

07:16.958 --> 07:20.416
Oh! Look at that flame.
He was made to be roadkill.

07:30.791 --> 07:34.333
- Where's the firefighters? The medics?
- You're gonna miss the best part.

07:34.416 --> 07:37.041
- Hey, throw the tin cans at her.
- Argh!

07:38.750 --> 07:42.125
(GRUNTS) Oi!
I'd like to see you all drive.

07:42.208 --> 07:43.666
Isn't this a touch barbaric?

07:43.750 --> 07:46.833
- Okay, now the small animals.
- Throw the animals!

07:46.916 --> 07:48.500
Are those hamsters?

07:51.250 --> 07:52.625
Topaz, chinchilla me.

07:52.708 --> 07:54.208
Calm your cheeks, Mojo.

07:54.291 --> 07:55.541
We used to throw rotten food,

07:55.625 --> 07:58.708
but given the recent famines
leaving people... How do I put this?

07:58.791 --> 07:59.958
- Starving.
- GRANDMASTER: Peckish.

08:00.041 --> 08:01.291
It's considered uncouth.

08:01.375 --> 08:03.166
(SQUEAKING)

08:06.041 --> 08:07.458
- Hey!
- Thank you.

08:09.416 --> 08:12.750
Hey, if you like my chinchillas,
you're gonna love my champion.

08:12.833 --> 08:14.458

Oh, no, no, no.

08:35.083 --> 08:37.541
Snuffy. I thought we were friends, bro.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.083
Here's the best part.

08:44.458 --> 08:46.250
So much for staying for one drink.

08:46.333 --> 08:48.291
Oh! You're doing the thing.
He's doing the thing.

08:54.625 --> 08:55.958
Uh, why is it sticky?

09:00.375 --> 09:02.916
Uh... Whoa! Ahhh!

09:06.625 --> 09:09.416
Careful, mate. This guy here
does not like to be touched.

Thanks for the tip, Mount Rushmore.

Your death.

(GROANS)

10:11.041 --> 10:13.041
Thank you very, very much.

10:13.125 --> 10:15.125
You've ruined my birthday. That's sarcasm.

10:15.208 --> 10:16.875
The first part, not the second part.

10:16.958 --> 10:19.208
Topaz, uh, fix this.

10:29.375 --> 10:32.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I specifically asked for a private room.

10:32.583 --> 10:34.166
No, no, no! Don't you dare lock me...

10:34.708 --> 10:37.041
He sensed a connection
between the two of you.

10:37.833 --> 10:39.458
Then why is he here?

10:39.541 --> 10:40.625
Then why is who here?

10:40.708 --> 10:44.333
There's nothing over here.
Just a big pile of rocks. With some eyes.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.500
Hey! No! Whoa!
Uh, hold on... No. Easy, easy!

10:49.583 --> 10:51.833
Hang on a minute.

10:52.083 --> 10:54.416
My quarrel is not with you. It's with...

10:54.500 --> 10:56.041
What? What are you doing?

10:56.208 --> 10:58.125
I don't usually do this
in front of company.

10:58.666 --> 11:00.833
Perk of having
an arc reactor in your chest.

11:00.916 --> 11:01.958
Now, who are you?

11:02.041 --> 11:04.833
And better question,
why are you trying to kill me?

11:04.916 --> 11:06.166
Well, hello. My name is Korg.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.541
I consider myself
more of a lover than a fighter.

11:08.625 --> 11:11.166
- Not you!
- I am the daughter of Thanos,

11:11.250 --> 11:14.833
the Mad Titan, the one burdened
to bring balance to this universe.

11:14.916 --> 11:16.500
Daughter of Thanos.

11:16.583 --> 11:18.791
Daddy wasn't very creative
with the names, was he?

11:18.875 --> 11:20.000
GAMORA: What are you doing?

11:20.083 --> 11:23.500
Not hanging around to play Dr. Moreau's
<i>Hunger Games,</i> that's for sure.

11:24.541 --> 11:26.541
Look at that magical bracelet he's got.

11:26.625 --> 11:29.416
All right. Ready to rock 'n' roll?
I had to say that at least once.

11:29.666 --> 11:31.708
Not you, Stabby. This is a two-man band.

11:31.791 --> 11:34.250
Oh, my gosh. Dream come true.
We're in a band.

11:38.666 --> 11:42.375
So, tell me about this Grandmaster.
Did he gerrymander the districts?

11:42.458 --> 11:45.416
Well, heck-a-rooney-zooney.
The Grandmaster ain't that bad.

11:45.500 --> 11:48.458
Actually, he is that bad.
He does spend all our money on death.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.500
Hmm. I should never have voted for him.

11:50.583 --> 11:51.625
STARK: That's not so bad.

11:51.708 --> 11:54.000
- All right. Wait for my signal.
- Say no more, bro.

- Whoo-hoo! Let's go!
- (GUARD SCREAMS)

11:59.041 --> 12:00.708

12:00.791 --> 12:02.583
Oh, Tony, Tony, Tony. You blinked.

12:02.666 --> 12:05.875
- On no planet is that a signal.
- Tony, I thought I saw your goatee twitch.

12:05.958 --> 12:08.083
- No. Still not a signal.
- No, it's doing it again.

12:08.166 --> 12:10.666
- Did you think that in the jail cell?
- It's a nervous tick.

12:10.750 --> 12:12.541
- Because I did it then.
- She's got a gun.

12:12.625 --> 12:14.833
You again. Did you glare
your way out of that cell?

12:14.916 --> 12:18.541
Oh, it'll take more than laser-proof glass
to rob Thanos of his victory.

12:18.625 --> 12:19.750
Yep, pick a new song.

12:23.750 --> 12:25.666
Huh. Thanks for the exit.

Okay, Thanos, Jr.
or whatever your name is,

12:59.291 --> 13:00.416
did we date or something?

- What's your dad got against me?
- You destroyed his Chitauri.

13:03.583 --> 13:06.000
New York? That was Thanos?

13:06.083 --> 13:09.916
Your victory might have been glorious,
but it will also be short.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.458
Victory? Glory?

13:11.541 --> 13:14.333
People died. I lost a friend.

13:14.791 --> 13:17.291
Do you know what it's like
to see your home world destroyed?

13:17.375 --> 13:19.375
Almost brought to its knees by a madman?

13:19.500 --> 13:21.458
Huh? Did you know about Daddy's plan?

13:21.541 --> 13:24.166
Did you watch
as those things tried to break us?

- You were lucky. Next time...
- There won't be a next time, Xena.

Hey, Korg, is this Grandmaster guy
as bad as my gut says he is?

13:44.833 --> 13:47.125
Oh, this one time,
he used me as a paperweight,

13:47.208 --> 13:50.083
and can you imagine how that felt?

13:50.166 --> 13:52.750
Just to have to sit on paper,
which is my nemesis.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.833
Mmm-hmm. Say no more.
Thrusters are ready. Just say the word.

13:56.916 --> 14:00.958
Then, for no greater reason than
to piss you off and prove you wrong,

14:01.041 --> 14:02.500
I'm gonna save this planet too.

14:02.583 --> 14:04.708

on an alien junk planet?

14:22.375 --> 14:24.041
Yeah, that's what I do.

14:25.291 --> 14:26.583
I'm Iron Man.

14:26.666 --> 14:27.958

14:28.041 --> 14:30.625
Wow! Your mother must be proud.

14:30.708 --> 14:33.541
I bet Mrs. Iron
brags to all the neighbors.

14:33.625 --> 14:35.333
First, we need a driver.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.708
KORG: Hmm. Look at this little thing.

14:40.791 --> 14:43.500
I think I'll name him Nikos,
after my friend Jeffrey.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.791
So, you're not a fool
or even a bad driver,

14:45.875 --> 14:47.416
yet you were in a death race.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.250
- Care to explain?
- I was going to win.

14:49.333 --> 14:51.625
Sure you were.
What happened to last year's winner?

14:51.708 --> 14:53.750
He went to live on a farm
with the other winners.

14:53.833 --> 14:55.166
It's a really interesting farm.

14:55.250 --> 14:58.750
They put you in this really comfy bed,
and then they put you into the ground,

14:58.833 --> 15:01.958
and then they put this cool stone thing
just up where your head is.

15:03.166 --> 15:05.083
Definitely no one dies.
They've got bunnies.

15:05.166 --> 15:08.250
My guess, and I'm in no way
speaking from personal experience,

15:08.333 --> 15:09.333
you want the thrill.

15:09.416 --> 15:11.916

if only for a moment, you know?

15:12.000 --> 15:15.750
So you can forget whatever mistake
has you chasing that demon in a bottle.

15:15.833 --> 15:17.833
First, Demon in a Bottle is sewer water.

15:17.916 --> 15:20.291
This is Demon Rum, top-shelf, gold label.

giving me life advice, goatee.

15:23.166 --> 15:24.250
Wow. Names hurt.

15:24.333 --> 15:27.041
The Grandmaster is a cheat,
and he deserves to be taken down.

15:27.125 --> 15:29.000
You're going to overthrow the Grandmaster?

15:29.791 --> 15:34.250
You? And you? (LAUGHS)

- Why aren't you two laughing?
- Tony, help, please.

15:36.666 --> 15:39.791
Nikos is pooping on me.
I do not like it. And he will not stop.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.833
Because we're gonna beat the Grandmaster
at his own game.

the spawn of Thanos being on your tail?

16:37.875 --> 16:40.625
Yeah. I hear he's not the type
you wanna meet in a dark alley.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.708
You shouldn't be here.
You should be running.

16:43.125 --> 16:44.583

Yes, but not a master genius like me. Hmm.
