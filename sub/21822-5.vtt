00:02.560 --> 00:04.400
[long croaking sound]

00:08.280 --> 00:12.080
-Mumble, mumble, blah.
-[Danny] Really good, Steven.

00:12.640 --> 00:16.040
Right. OK, the bit where it says
"mumble, mumble,"

00:16.120 --> 00:19.280
am I meant to mumble something
in an incoherent manner

00:19.360 --> 00:22.560
or am I meant to actually
say "mumble, mumble?"

00:22.640 --> 00:23.800
What'd you do in the last take?

00:23.880 --> 00:26.760
I said the words "mumble, mumble,"
but I mumbled them.

00:28.240 --> 00:31.080
Hi, Steven, this is Clem Fandango.
Can you hear me?

00:31.160 --> 00:33.120
Yes, I can hear you, Clem Fandango.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.600
We have to phone head office in New York
to get clarification.

00:35.680 --> 00:37.680
Oh, for God's sake.

00:38.680 --> 00:39.840
OK, bye.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.120
-Steven.
-Yeah?

00:42.200 --> 00:44.120
So the actual words are "mumble, mumble."

00:44.200 --> 00:47.120
You want me to say "mumble, mumble"
so it's obvious that's what I'm saying?

00:47.200 --> 00:48.200
That would be great.

00:50.200 --> 00:51.720
[long croaking sound]

00:51.800 --> 00:55.800
Mumble, mumble. Blah.

00:56.840 --> 00:57.960
It's ridiculous.

00:58.040 --> 00:59.160
What was that, Steven?

00:59.240 --> 01:01.800
I said I think it's ridiculous!
What the fuck is this for?

01:03.400 --> 01:05.600
Steven, we're gonna phone New York again.

01:05.680 --> 01:06.920
[laughs] You're kidding?

01:11.840 --> 01:16.440
Um, Steven? Seems to be a bit of
a disagreement about how to play this.

01:16.520 --> 01:19.640
-Yeah, I should say so.
-We've a differing opinion from New York.

01:19.720 --> 01:22.120
OK, well in future, why don't you speak
to New York,

01:22.200 --> 01:24.160
find out exactly what they want from you?

01:24.240 --> 01:26.680
Otherwise, you're just
completely wasting my time!

01:26.760 --> 01:28.720
Yeah, sorry. I'm sorry, Steven.

01:30.640 --> 01:32.240
[Toast] Bloody waste of time.

01:32.320 --> 01:35.120
-[laughs] That's the best one yet.
-Yes!

01:37.040 --> 01:38.080
[Danny] The best one yet.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.680
[Toast] I've forgotten my pencil.

01:41.480 --> 01:42.840
What were you laughing at?

01:44.320 --> 01:46.160
Just recording some laughter
for a radio play.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.720
[forced, shouting laughter]

01:54.160 --> 01:55.640
Record that.

02:22.360 --> 02:24.960
It's all done at high pressure,
it's very intense,

02:25.040 --> 02:26.360
and highly controversial.

02:26.440 --> 02:29.040
I suggested once to an old girlfriend
that we try doing that.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.120
I thought she'd be up
for absolutely anything

02:31.200 --> 02:33.680
because she'd been in  Tipping the Velvet
with Anna Chancellor.

02:33.760 --> 02:35.000
But when we got into the bedroom,

02:35.080 --> 02:37.720
her tastes proved
to be disappointingly conventional.

02:38.560 --> 02:40.600
No, I was talking about fracking.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.360
-What?
-Fracking.

02:42.440 --> 02:46.160
Induced hydraulic fracturing,
or hydro-fracturing.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.560
-Commonly known as fracking.
-Oh.

02:48.640 --> 02:50.880
You seemed to think it was something
quite different.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.280
I must've misheard you, Toast.

02:52.360 --> 02:53.760
Oh. Are these your crisps?

02:56.320 --> 02:57.560
Who's this prick?

02:57.640 --> 02:59.920
"Old Style Country Farm Crisps

03:00.000 --> 03:05.080
have been manufactured on
our family farm in Devon for 200 years."

03:05.160 --> 03:06.600
As if!

03:06.680 --> 03:08.400
Sterling Porrich is the prat's name.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.640
I didn't think they had crisps
200 years ago.

03:10.720 --> 03:14.040
-They didn't, Ed, it's all bullshit.
-It's not very subtle or subliminal.

03:15.840 --> 03:18.480
No one has any time these days
for anything subtle or subliminal.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.920
It's the new thing. Big cheese determined
to associate himself with his product.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Gives us a cock-and-bull history
of his life

03:29.080 --> 03:32.720
and sticks his own mugshot on the packet.
He's going out with your ex-wife.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.760
-What did you say, Ed?
-Hm?

03:35.840 --> 03:37.960
You slipped something on the end
of that last sentence

03:38.040 --> 03:40.360
which wasn't connected
to the point you were making.

03:41.360 --> 03:44.680
I was trying to break it to you gently,
Toast, in a subliminal fashion,

03:44.760 --> 03:46.200
in case you might take it badly.

03:46.280 --> 03:47.680
What the hell are you talking about?

03:48.320 --> 03:52.280
Your ex-wife, Ellen, is going out
with a Devon crisp manufacturer

03:52.360 --> 03:54.120
called Sterling Porrich.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.720
I presume it's the same chap.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.320
-How the hell do you know that?
-Social diary in  The Standard.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.800
They were at Silverstone together.

04:01.080 --> 04:03.800
I tell you, this crisp fellow,
must be super, super rich.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.240
Super, super rich.

04:06.320 --> 04:07.920
Super, super, super, super...

04:08.000 --> 04:10.120
-All right, Ed!
-[phone rings]

04:12.400 --> 04:14.360
-Hello?
-Yes, Toast, please.

04:15.640 --> 04:16.640
It's for you, Toast.

04:18.480 --> 04:21.160
-Jane?
-I've just negotiated something

04:21.240 --> 04:27.480
rather marvelous for you, that I
guarantee is going to blow your socks off.

04:27.560 --> 04:30.320
Well, that's great news.
I'll be there as quickly as I can.

04:30.400 --> 04:34.160
It's terribly irritating
you've lost your phone, Toast.

04:34.240 --> 04:37.600
What if a job came up
or a nuclear war or something?

04:37.680 --> 04:39.040
I wouldn't know where you were.

04:39.120 --> 04:41.320
What's this job
that's gonna blow my socks off?

04:41.400 --> 04:43.200
Anyway, you're in luck, re: phone.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.880
Those nice people at 023...
Do you remember?

04:45.960 --> 04:47.880
You did a voiceover for them last month.

04:47.960 --> 04:50.800
Total cunts. What's this job
that's gonna blow my socks off?

04:50.880 --> 04:56.400
They've given you a little bonus gift
because they were so pleased with you.

04:56.480 --> 04:58.640
The 023E17.

04:58.720 --> 05:02.040
Perfect sound, amazing signal,
no matter where you are.

05:02.120 --> 05:04.440
You could use it on the moon
if you have to.

05:04.520 --> 05:06.920
What's this job
that's gonna blow my socks off!?

05:07.000 --> 05:11.800
Even has, look at this...
a mini fire extinguisher.

05:11.880 --> 05:13.280
Bloody hell.

05:13.360 --> 05:16.800
-And a tiny oxygen mask.
-[air hisses]

05:16.880 --> 05:18.240
That's ridiculous.

05:18.320 --> 05:21.720
What possible circumstance
would that be of any use to anyone?

05:21.800 --> 05:24.680
What's this job
that's gonna blow my socks off?

05:24.760 --> 05:27.400
You don't have to use them! Shush!

05:27.480 --> 05:29.320
You can take it.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.680
I've got some super, super news for you.

05:33.280 --> 05:38.120
Have you ever wanted to star
in a major Hollywood film?

05:39.000 --> 05:42.560
Is Ray Purchase
the biggest bell-end in London?

05:43.720 --> 05:45.800
Well, of course
I wanna be in a Hollywood film!

05:45.880 --> 05:48.800
Well, now's your chance.
And when I tell you who your co-star is,

05:48.880 --> 05:50.880
you're going to fall off your chair.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.400
I haven't told you yet, Toast.

05:56.480 --> 05:59.240
Sorry, Jane. Who is it?
Is it Daniel Day-Lewis?

05:59.320 --> 06:02.800
No, Daniel's given up acting
to build shoes again.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.400
Again? What an idiot.
Well, who is it then?

06:06.680 --> 06:08.200
Max Gland.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.120
Bloody hell! Well, I know who he is.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.680
Yes! Even you, who has
the tiresome characteristic

06:12.760 --> 06:15.520
of saying you've never heard of anyone,
knows who Max Gland is.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.600
He's over here shooting a movie.
He wants you to be in it.

06:18.680 --> 06:21.560
What, he's asked for me personally?
He's aware of my work?

06:21.640 --> 06:24.560
Of course. He selected you specially

06:24.640 --> 06:27.320
from the pages
of the  Spotlight Actors Directory.

06:28.440 --> 06:31.760
There are literally a million actors
in  Spotlight.

06:31.840 --> 06:36.600
He didn't just flick through it randomly
and stop where his finger came to rest.

06:36.680 --> 06:38.320
He chose you.

06:39.560 --> 06:40.560
OK.

06:40.640 --> 06:44.640
There are a few minor stipulations
about working with Max Gland.

06:44.720 --> 06:48.440
Very minor. Umm...
You're not allowed to look at him,

06:48.520 --> 06:50.960
talk to him, mention his name

06:51.040 --> 06:54.040
or eat or drink within two miles of him.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.360
Doesn't sound too unlike my last marriage!

06:56.440 --> 06:57.920
[laughs loudly]

06:58.000 --> 06:59.080
It won't be a problem,

06:59.160 --> 07:02.800
or at least a problem
that two million pounds won't fix.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.000
Two million?

07:04.560 --> 07:06.680
I'm going to ask them for two million!

07:06.760 --> 07:09.640
They're loaded. Hurrah for Hollywood!

07:09.720 --> 07:10.840
[yells] When is it?

07:10.920 --> 07:14.360
-Tuesday.
-Shit! I've got a voiceover on Tuesday.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.800
They want you in the morning,
voiceover in the afternoon.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.160
Tickety-boo, my money's on you.

07:18.240 --> 07:20.520
They'll probably send you a limousine.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.200
[laughs loudly]

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Brilliant.

07:31.280 --> 07:34.120
-Hi, you're Steven?
-Steven Toast.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.240
-Is the director around?
-I'm Lindy Makehouse.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.240
I'm the third assistant director. OK?

07:38.320 --> 07:40.560
Here's the casket. Climb in, buddy.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.600
-What?
-You wanna climb into the casket?

07:44.360 --> 07:45.520
-Why?
-[radio crackles]

07:46.120 --> 07:47.560
Yeah, the guy's here. Yeah?

07:47.640 --> 07:49.640
Yeah, just get him into the casket, OK.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.080
-Just climb into the casket, dude!
-[radio crackles]

07:52.160 --> 07:54.280
Oh, and you'll need this wig.

07:54.360 --> 07:57.240
-Why do I need this?
-Max thought you should wear it.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.480
Shouldn't I go to costume
or makeup or something?

07:59.560 --> 08:00.720
You just need the wig.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.960
We'll be on long shot,
so we wont see much of your face.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.360
If you could just pop it on.

08:05.440 --> 08:06.320
OK.

08:07.480 --> 08:08.840
Well, does Max dig me up?

08:08.920 --> 08:10.480
Will I get rescued or something?

08:10.560 --> 08:12.920
You ask a hell of a lot of questions!
[laughs]

08:13.000 --> 08:14.320
I haven't even seen a script.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.600
Max doesn't like the other actors
seeing the script.

08:16.680 --> 08:20.120
-I've no idea what my character is.
-Max doesn't like the other actors

08:20.200 --> 08:22.760
-knowing anything about their characters.
-[man screams]

08:22.840 --> 08:24.520
[radio crackles]

08:24.600 --> 08:27.320
Yes, Roger, I just saw him run past.

08:27.400 --> 08:30.800
-That's Max Gland, isn't it?
-Please don't look at him or say his name.

08:33.400 --> 08:34.360
Hey, you!

08:35.360 --> 08:37.200
Don't look up. Just say yes.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.520
-Yes?
-Get me a dog.

08:40.480 --> 08:42.120
[screams]

08:43.120 --> 08:47.000
-Steven, Max wants you to get him a dog.
-What the fuck are you talking about?

08:47.080 --> 08:49.200
Max has been having
a bit of a tough time recently.

08:49.280 --> 08:52.600
What, he wants me to get him a dog?
Well, why don't you do it?

08:52.680 --> 08:56.160
Well, Max wants you to do it.
It's a good sign. It means he likes you.

08:57.320 --> 09:00.240
-How?
-I don't know. Just borrow one.

09:02.880 --> 09:03.880
OK?

09:05.120 --> 09:06.400
Fuck's sake.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.280
There's one! Pull over, man.

09:21.560 --> 09:22.640
[dog whines]

09:32.880 --> 09:33.880
Where's the dog?

09:35.560 --> 09:37.000
[bell tolls]

09:37.800 --> 09:39.120
How long will I be in here?

09:39.920 --> 09:42.640
-Oh, not long!
-Well, how long exactly?

09:42.720 --> 09:45.960
I can't clarify that
until everyone's back from lunch. OK?

09:46.040 --> 09:47.800
Oh, God!

09:55.080 --> 09:57.560
-Yes, I'll tell him.
-Hey there, little pal.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.960
-How's it going?
-Max, we need you back on set.

10:00.040 --> 10:02.400
And Roger says
you have to give the dog back.

10:04.240 --> 10:05.320
Did you say something?

10:05.400 --> 10:09.000
Roger needs you on set and he says
you have to stop playing with the dog.

10:09.080 --> 10:11.600
No, I'm gonna play with this dog
and if you don't let me do that,

10:11.680 --> 10:14.320
I'm gonna shoot the dog,
then shoot myself in the head.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.680
-Roger says--
-You think I'm jerking around?

10:18.880 --> 10:19.880
[gunshot]

10:20.720 --> 10:21.760
[gunshot]

10:21.840 --> 10:23.160
[thud]

10:23.960 --> 10:25.000
[radio crackles]

10:25.920 --> 10:30.080
Roger, hi.
Just an update on the Max situation...

10:30.160 --> 10:32.280
[car drives away]

10:34.800 --> 10:36.840
[Toast] I say, when will I be dug up?

10:38.160 --> 10:39.400
Wow.

10:45.360 --> 10:46.640
This is ridiculous.

10:46.720 --> 10:47.960
[flame roars]

10:48.040 --> 10:49.040
What...

10:49.920 --> 10:51.200
Jesus!

10:51.880 --> 10:53.160
Fuck's sake!

10:54.840 --> 10:55.840
[phone beeps]

10:58.520 --> 10:59.520
[sighs]

10:59.600 --> 11:00.880
[dials number]

11:00.960 --> 11:01.960
[party music]

11:02.040 --> 11:03.320
[phone rings]

11:05.880 --> 11:07.000
Hello?

11:07.080 --> 11:09.160
Jane, I've been buried alive.

11:09.240 --> 11:13.200
What's that, Toast? I can't hear you.
The music's quite loud here.

11:13.280 --> 11:14.680
I've been buried alive!

11:14.760 --> 11:18.520
What? Well, how can that happen?
I thought you were on that film.

11:18.600 --> 11:20.920
I am. I've been here for three hours.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Something must have gone wrong
above ground.

11:23.840 --> 11:27.360
I'm not back in the office until tomorrow.
Can it wait until then?

11:27.440 --> 11:30.800
I don't really wanna spend the night
buried alive underground, Jane!

11:30.880 --> 11:36.080
Well, I'm sure someone will come along
and dig you up shortly.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.760
Give it another hour or two.

11:37.840 --> 11:41.920
I'm not gonna give it an hour or two,
Jane. I'm buried alive!

11:42.000 --> 11:44.360
-[line goes dead]
-My turn!

11:45.240 --> 11:46.280
Unbelievable.

11:47.160 --> 11:48.680
[dials number]

11:48.760 --> 11:51.640
-[tranquil music]
-There she is.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.200
[phone rings]

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
-[voicemail]  This is Ed Howzer-Black.
-Oh, God.

12:02.080 --> 12:03.480
Please contact my agent.  [beep]

12:03.560 --> 12:06.360
Fuck you, Ed! I'm buried alive!

12:08.760 --> 12:10.480
-[phone beeps]
-What?

12:11.040 --> 12:12.520
"I love you. Ellen."

12:13.600 --> 12:16.120
What, Ellen as in my ex-wife?

12:16.200 --> 12:18.880
[thinks]  But I haven't heard
from her in ages.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.640
Ellen, she still loves me.

12:21.720 --> 12:22.720
Oh, Ellen.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.800
[applause]

12:24.880 --> 12:27.280
It was my wife

12:27.360 --> 12:32.200
who suggested we hold the wedding
in this beautiful country of Thailand

12:32.280 --> 12:36.400
rather than my initial idea
of Putney Registry Office.

12:36.480 --> 12:37.840
[laughter]

12:37.920 --> 12:41.360
My parents and brother
couldn't afford to be here.

12:42.040 --> 12:44.120
Oh, they would have enjoyed this occasion.

12:44.200 --> 12:48.520
Especially my father, who I know would've
taken full advantage of the free bar.

12:48.600 --> 12:49.760
[laughter]

12:49.840 --> 12:53.680
I mean, what alcoholic wouldn't
take advantage of a free bar? [laughs]

12:53.760 --> 12:54.840
[silence]

12:55.960 --> 12:58.000
Yes, um...

12:59.520 --> 13:02.440
Hey, you're Clem Fandango aren't you?

13:03.440 --> 13:05.320
Yes, I'm Clem Fandango.

13:05.400 --> 13:08.840
I'm Ellen. I'm getting married to Toast,
here on the beach.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.080
-Not Steven Toast?
-Uh-huh.

13:11.160 --> 13:14.520
I assume you're not invited.
He fucking hates you.

13:14.600 --> 13:17.040
No. It's a total coincidence I'm here.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.560
Ah. Would you like a drink?

13:24.840 --> 13:27.080
Like any actor, I've suffered setbacks.

13:27.160 --> 13:30.800
Many, many, many people
have fucked me over.

13:31.560 --> 13:32.640
Bear with me.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.160
Tom Conti.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.640
Tim Pigott-Smith.

13:38.720 --> 13:40.840
Colin Firth, oh yes.

13:41.800 --> 13:43.560
Hugh Bonneville.

13:43.640 --> 13:48.600
Nigel Havers. Michael Fassbender.

13:48.680 --> 13:51.080

-Trevor Eve.

14:00.760 --> 14:04.000
Noel Edmonds. Martin Shaw.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.640
Every man-jack of them!

14:08.840 --> 14:10.760
But on this glorious day,

14:12.080 --> 14:16.360
on the beach front, surrounded by friends
and my beautiful

14:17.120 --> 14:19.520
almost "virginial" wife,

14:20.560 --> 14:25.360
I really think things are looking up
for Steven Toast.

14:25.440 --> 14:26.920
Toast!

14:28.600 --> 14:31.880
[screaming]

14:31.960 --> 14:34.920
[Toast] Oh, Ellen. Lovely, lovely Ellen.

14:35.640 --> 14:39.680
Even a tsunami on our wedding day
couldn't destroy our love.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.600
[phone rings]

14:42.440 --> 14:45.200
Hi, Steven. This is Clem Fandango.
Can you hear me?

14:45.280 --> 14:47.480
Yes, I can hear you, Clem Fandango.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.960
Even though I'm buried alive
in a fucking coffin!

14:50.040 --> 14:51.040
What's that, Steven?

14:51.120 --> 14:53.280
I'm in a coffin
which is buried underground!

14:54.320 --> 14:56.480
He says he's in a coffin
which is buried underground.

14:58.280 --> 15:02.120
Steven? Expecting you in for a voiceover.
I've got Sterling the client here.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.440
Clem says you're buried
in a coffin underground.

15:04.520 --> 15:05.920
-That's right.
-It's a clear line.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.440
You don't sound like you're buried.

15:07.520 --> 15:09.480
I'm buried underground all right.

15:09.560 --> 15:13.480
You using the new 023E17?
I've got one of those. They're mega.

15:13.560 --> 15:14.840
Who gives a shit?

15:14.920 --> 15:17.320
You'll probably be all right
to do the voice-over from there.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.080
I'm just gonna put you on speakerphone.

15:23.240 --> 15:24.520
There. Do you have the script?

15:24.600 --> 15:27.280
It shouldn't take too long.
I've got a rehearsal.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.640
I'm one of the torch relay carriers
for the Commonwealth Games.

15:31.360 --> 15:33.720
The Commonwealth Games?
Who gives a monkey's about that?

15:33.800 --> 15:35.040
Do you have script, Steven?

15:35.120 --> 15:36.920
[Danny]  I've got Sterling the client here.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.680
We're old mates actually.
He just wants a few words before we begin.

15:40.760 --> 15:45.000
[electronic voice]  All I need you to do is
say exactly what it says in the scripts.

15:45.080 --> 15:48.600
Don't mess with it
or change any of the words.

15:48.680 --> 15:52.080
And I'm not too fucking impressed
that you're buried in a coffin

15:52.160 --> 15:53.320
instead of being here.

15:53.400 --> 15:56.560
Is there anything wrong with your voice?
You sound like a robot.

15:56.640 --> 16:00.000
There's nothing wrong
with my fucking voice, matey-boy.

16:00.080 --> 16:03.320
Just do your job.
That's what you're getting paid for.

16:03.400 --> 16:04.400
All right!

16:05.160 --> 16:06.520
[Toast]  Good God.

16:07.560 --> 16:13.640
"Old Style Country Farm Crisps have been
manufactured on our family farm in Devon

16:13.720 --> 16:17.520
using techniques dating back 200 years."

16:17.600 --> 16:20.880
-Are you putting on an accent?
-No.

16:20.960 --> 16:24.240
You'd better not be putting on
some country bumpkin accent.

16:24.320 --> 16:29.200
Just because I'm from Devon doesn't mean
I'm a member of the fucking Wurzels.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.800
-No, I wasn't--
-Stop interrupting.

16:31.880 --> 16:34.640
-Just do your job, you cunt.
-I was just--

16:34.720 --> 16:37.840
[snorting]
Just read what it says on the script.

16:37.920 --> 16:40.720
-[gasping for air] "Only..."
-Come on.

16:40.800 --> 16:45.200
-"Only the finest quality crisps...
-Just read what it says on the script.

16:45.280 --> 16:46.920
[Toast]  I'm running out of oxygen.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.920
I'm in a coffin. Give me a second.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.160
[air hisses]

16:54.200 --> 16:55.440
How you doing there, Steven?

16:55.520 --> 16:58.840
I'm all right.
I've just used a tiny oxygen mask.

16:58.920 --> 17:02.240
-That's great. Shall we crack on?
-[Toast]  All right.

17:02.320 --> 17:06.319
"Only the finest quality potatoes
are chosen.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.680
That's why Porrich--"

17:08.760 --> 17:13.200
Hold on a second. You're that prick
that's been fucking my ex-wife Ellen.

17:13.280 --> 17:16.280
-No, I didn't.
-Not you, Clem Fandango.

17:16.359 --> 17:17.440
Porrich.

17:17.520 --> 17:21.160
-That's funny. She never mentioned you.
-[Toast]  She still loves me.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.720
She's just sent me a text.

17:22.800 --> 17:26.200
Well, she never mentioned you to me.
Not even once.

17:26.280 --> 17:27.520
[Danny]  That went really well.

17:27.599 --> 17:30.400
Um, all very happy with that,
so I think we are done.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.920
-We will see you again soon, yeah?
-I've been buried alive!

17:33.000 --> 17:35.040
Can you call the fire brigade or someone?

17:35.120 --> 17:37.600
-Yep, thank you, Steven.
-I'm buried alive!

17:37.680 --> 17:38.680
Thank you, Steven.

17:38.760 --> 17:41.360
And I'm going to marry Ellen next week.

17:42.080 --> 17:45.960
Over my dead body.
I've gotta get out of here.

17:46.040 --> 17:48.920
I'll phone the emergency services myself.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.280
Oh, no!

19:07.760 --> 19:08.960
[Danny] Steven.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.600
Managed to get out then,
from being buried alive in that coffin.

19:11.680 --> 19:12.920
I was saved.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.240
Due to fracking on the exact spot.
Where's Sterling Porrich?

19:16.320 --> 19:19.840
I'm Porrich.
What the fuck's it got to do with you?

19:19.920 --> 19:22.120
He looks nothing
like the man on the crisp packets.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.800
Oh, I'm him, all right.

19:23.880 --> 19:27.040
And I'm getting married to Ellen.
So screw you.

19:27.120 --> 19:30.080

20:21.480 --> 20:22.640
What's up, Steven?

20:22.720 --> 20:24.600
It's from Ellen.

20:24.680 --> 20:28.840
"Soz, but that last message
was meant for someone else."

20:32.440 --> 20:35.040
She probably meant to send it to Sterling.

20:35.120 --> 20:37.240
[Danny] Probably, yeah.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.280
Excuse that.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.720
[Toast] It's not even him, you know.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.480
It's some other farmer.

20:49.120 --> 20:53.920
Still, good news about the fracking, eh?
Very lucky.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.560
Damn lucky. They started drilling at six
in the morning to avoid the protestors.

20:58.640 --> 21:02.680
And the doctor reckoned I only had another
ten seconds' worth of oxygen left!

21:02.760 --> 21:04.760
Ten seconds?
That's cutting it pretty fine.

21:06.080 --> 21:09.560
So, Porrich is still going to marry Ellen,
I presume?

21:09.640 --> 21:11.720
Once he's recovered from his injuries.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.800
This is a big blow for me, Ed.

21:13.880 --> 21:16.360
It's gonna take me a while to get over it.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.280
[Ed] It's been two months now, Toast!

21:23.800 --> 21:26.480
[sighs] God, I hate Sterling Porrich.

21:27.600 --> 21:28.720
[growls]

21:29.720 --> 21:31.840
You're just gonna have to get over it.

21:31.920 --> 21:33.320
Yeah, I suppose you're right, Ed.

21:34.360 --> 21:37.080
You're only feeling bad
because you gave a man in a wheelchair

21:37.160 --> 21:39.000
a severe thrashing with a baseball bat.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.920
I don't regret that, Ed.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.680
Any man in my position
would've done the same.

21:43.760 --> 21:47.200
I just can't stomach the fact
that he's still going to marry Ellen.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.120
Look, Toast.

21:50.200 --> 21:51.960
You've got to get out
into the world again.

21:52.600 --> 21:53.640
Think positive.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.800
Do something useful.

21:57.520 --> 21:58.880
Now, what could you do?

21:59.840 --> 22:03.600
Well, actually, there is something else
that's been playing on my mind.

22:03.680 --> 22:04.840
What?

22:04.920 --> 22:08.560
I did a great wrong
that I'd like to put right.

22:12.840 --> 22:13.840
Sorry...

22:17.520 --> 22:18.560
