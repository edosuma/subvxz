WEBVTT

00:09.100 --> 00:11.333
You know how we go on
a family trip once or twice a

00:11.333 --> 00:12.633
- year?
Mm-hmm.

00:12.633 --> 00:15.400
- So, I'm thinking Vail.
- Vail.

00:15.400 --> 00:17.900
I am so excited to
surprise the kids.

00:17.900 --> 00:21.133
It's just the perfect place to
take the family.

00:21.133 --> 00:23.400
Scott's asking if
he can come.

00:23.400 --> 00:24.667
I think Scott should
come.

00:24.667 --> 00:27.933
I feel like it's a
good opportunity to see if he

00:27.933 --> 00:30.167
can handle coming on family
vacations.

00:30.167 --> 00:32.933
You just need to keep it
together, dude.

00:32.933 --> 00:35.567
Well, you got yourself
a deal, kid.

00:35.567 --> 00:38.167
- Welcome to Vail.
- Oh, my God, guys.

00:38.167 --> 00:40.933
- Look at this, baby Rob.
- I can't believe Rob

00:40.933 --> 00:43.467
- isn't here.
- Rob is just a.

00:43.467 --> 00:45.700
He proposed in front of her
whole family.

00:45.700 --> 00:48.800
We wake up to my brother
just getting engaged.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.067
He hasn't told us
anything.

00:50.067 --> 00:53.467
That's so  up that he did
that.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.267
Morning.
Hi.

01:04.267 --> 01:06.533
- These are so cute.
- So cute.

01:06.533 --> 01:11.600
A little rescue St. Bernard.

01:11.600 --> 01:15.000
Okay, let me see what's
going on here.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.400
- See the drama.
- Huh?

01:18.400 --> 01:20.767
- You all right?
- I guess Rob got

01:20.767 --> 01:23.600
- engaged last night.
- What?

01:23.600 --> 01:25.500
Yeah.

01:27.167 --> 01:29.300
I'll tell you, never

01:29.300 --> 01:31.733
a dull moment. How are you?
I mean, are you all right?

01:31.733 --> 01:34.700
No, but that's why
we're just wandering.

01:34.700 --> 01:39.333
I wake up to a gazillion text
messages, which is never good

01:39.333 --> 01:44.667
news, and I'm reading through
them and realize Rob got engaged

01:44.667 --> 01:47.867
last night.
He got engaged.

01:47.867 --> 01:50.100
And it's sort of coming out of
left field.

01:50.100 --> 01:53.767
Like, I-I think I'm just in
shock.

01:53.767 --> 01:57.067
- How did he tell you?
- He didn't.

01:57.067 --> 01:59.333
It was just all over the
Internet.

01:59.333 --> 02:01.900
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's wild.

02:01.900 --> 02:04.167
- No, it's not right.
- He asked for her mom's

02:04.167 --> 02:06.500
hand in marriage and I'm like,
we don't even... he's never even

02:06.500 --> 02:09.133
- mentioned it to us.
- You gonna call him?

02:09.133 --> 02:12.833
No. Mm-mm.
I'm not gonna call him.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.133
I don't-- I mean, he should've
called me and said...

02:15.133 --> 02:18.267
- I understand.
- I didn't do

02:18.267 --> 02:21.333
anything to him except give
him an amazing life.

02:21.333 --> 02:23.467
Put one foot in front
the other.

02:23.467 --> 02:25.833
- Yeah.
- Take each day one at

02:25.833 --> 02:27.900
- a time.
- Yeah.

02:27.900 --> 02:31.067
To hear that Rob got engaged

02:31.067 --> 02:36.833
through social media is a bit
disappointing to say the least.

02:36.833 --> 02:39.900
He should've told me first, or
even talked to the family about

02:39.900 --> 02:42.033
it, or mentioned it to his
sisters.

02:42.033 --> 02:45.200
But...
I had no idea.

02:50.100 --> 02:51.900
I love you.
I love you so much.

02:51.900 --> 02:53.433
Are you guys on the

02:53.433 --> 02:55.400
lift?
Who are you on the lift with?

02:55.400 --> 02:58.000
- The instructor.
- He's doing

02:58.000 --> 03:00.833
- unbelievably, he's killing it.
- I've been down about

03:00.833 --> 03:02.600
five times.
I'm doing pretty good.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.467
I'm warming up, but I'm doing
all right.

03:05.467 --> 03:08.333
Yeah, I got the best skis.
I don't know if I'm gonna

03:08.333 --> 03:09.833
- separate from them.
- Oh.

03:09.833 --> 03:11.800
I like-- my boots
and skis are so cool.

03:11.800 --> 03:15.133
What?

03:15.133 --> 03:16.900
I said my boots and my
skis are so cool.

03:16.900 --> 03:18.700
- Yeah.
- I like 'em.

03:18.700 --> 03:22.367
Good, babe.
I feel so bad that I'm so

03:22.367 --> 03:25.933
distracted while Corey's trying
to tell me about his skiing

03:25.933 --> 03:27.933
because he's having such a good
time.

03:27.933 --> 03:32.067
I think I'm just still in shock
and just trying to digest this

03:32.067 --> 03:34.567
- whole situation with Rob.
- You don't sound too

03:34.567 --> 03:35.867
- excited.
- I am.

03:35.867 --> 03:40.133
- So excited.
- All right, bye-bye.

03:58.667 --> 04:01.400
- Okay.
- What shoes are you

04:01.400 --> 04:03.700
- wearing, T?
- I have on tennis shoes.

04:03.700 --> 04:06.067
This is about to be
an adventure.

04:06.067 --> 04:09.067
I'm already tired.

04:09.067 --> 04:11.467
We have not been to Vail in so
many years, and this trip is

04:11.467 --> 04:14.300
super important to us, so just
because we got a little bit of

04:14.300 --> 04:17.600
this negative news, I don't want
it ruining our trip.

04:17.600 --> 04:22.333
So, we are going to ignore and
go skiing and enjoy the rest of

04:22.333 --> 04:25.767
- our trip.
- All right, team, we

04:25.767 --> 04:27.633
- out.
- We out.

04:31.733 --> 04:36.533
Northie.
Oh, my God, you look so cute!

04:36.533 --> 04:38.467
What's wrong with you,
boy?

04:38.467 --> 04:40.833
I think it's colder
than I thought.

04:40.833 --> 04:42.567
We're gonna go
skiing!

04:42.567 --> 04:45.800
Welcome to Vail.
Have a great day.

04:45.800 --> 04:48.733
Oh! You okay?

04:48.733 --> 04:54.200
I thought it was gonna
go without me.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.567
Okay, kind of don't want to do
this anymore.

04:56.567 --> 04:58.000
- This is pretty high.
- Now I'm getting

04:58.000 --> 05:01.100
scared.
God, and my helmet didn't fit.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.900
- Is this a bad sign?
- I'm scared, too.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.167
- You're scared, too?
- Oh, my God, if a

05:06.167 --> 05:09.400
Jenner is scared, then we've got
a problem.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.533
Scott, it was, like, 75
degrees.

05:11.533 --> 05:14.567
- 75?
- No, that's what they

05:14.567 --> 05:16.467
told us.

05:25.233 --> 05:28.067
This trip is
definitely the most time

05:28.067 --> 05:30.633
Kourtney and I have spent
together since we've broken up,

05:30.633 --> 05:33.967
and it's definitely a little
different because, you know,

05:33.967 --> 05:35.767
Kourtney and I aren't together
anymore.

05:35.767 --> 05:37.933
So, I don't really know how to
act.

05:37.933 --> 05:41.300
I mean, I miss my family and I
miss being around Kourtney, so

05:41.300 --> 05:53.733
it's... it's a lot of things to
get used to.

05:53.733 --> 05:55.633
So, are we ready to
rock and roll?

05:55.633 --> 05:59.467
- It's cold!
- Can I see my girl ski?

05:59.467 --> 06:01.833
Yeah?

06:01.833 --> 06:05.933
Wow, P!
Look at you.

06:16.467 --> 06:18.800
Kourtney, ah!
If you knock me down, I'm gonna

06:18.800 --> 06:28.000
kill you.
We made it.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.233
Oh, this is fabulous.

06:31.233 --> 06:33.667
- This is fantastic.
- It's so good.

06:33.667 --> 06:37.933
- Whoo! Ah.
- Randy, how was it?

06:37.933 --> 06:40.700
Oh, it was beautiful.
So good after all those years.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.100
- How long has it been?
- Fifteen.

06:43.100 --> 06:46.033
Stop.
Stop it.

06:46.033 --> 06:49.600
- There they are.
- Hi. Did you go up?

06:49.600 --> 06:51.967
- Oh, my gosh...
- Hey, Scott. Hi.

06:51.967 --> 06:54.667
How you doing?

06:54.667 --> 06:57.967
Oh, my God!
You look like you're on Sesame

06:57.967 --> 07:00.767
Street.
Oh, my God, look at Mom, Scott.

07:00.767 --> 07:02.367
- Purple haze.
- Come here, let me

07:02.367 --> 07:05.333
touch you.

07:05.333 --> 07:08.300
So he came, he brought
the ring, and then, like, all of

07:08.300 --> 07:13.100
her whole family was there, and
he just did it.

07:13.100 --> 07:17.000
It's just so bizarre.
He has not spoken to any of us.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.933
He must legitimately hate our
whole family.

07:20.933 --> 07:23.267
Everyone's calling us, like, our
friends, like, asking if it's

07:23.267 --> 07:26.033
true, and they want to
congratulate Rob, and it's kind

07:26.033 --> 07:27.800
of embarrassing for us to not
know.

07:27.800 --> 07:31.033
Like, of course, do whatever you
want, like, do what makes you

07:31.033 --> 07:33.000
happy.
I got married once and didn't

07:33.000 --> 07:36.733
tell my whole family, but I
don't know, it just seems so not

07:36.733 --> 07:40.067
like him.
Kourt, that was Roxy, and she

07:40.067 --> 07:44.333
basically said that Rob said
he's loving his life, um...

07:44.333 --> 07:46.967
He was the same with
Adrienne, the same with Rita.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.900
What are you gonna do?
Nothing you can do.

07:49.900 --> 07:53.667
The best thing is to sit back
and just let them be.

07:53.667 --> 07:55.333
- Yeah.
- Like, everything you're

07:55.333 --> 07:58.067
going through, like, I've been
through worse with her, you

07:58.067 --> 07:59.867
- know?
- Tyga did have a

07:59.867 --> 08:03.267
relationship with Chyna, so I
appreciate his perspective on

08:03.267 --> 08:06.433
the situation, but he also has
to understand where we're coming

08:06.433 --> 08:09.800
from as well.
Rob, even after the fact, hasn't

08:09.800 --> 08:11.967
- said anything to us.
- I would literally never

08:11.967 --> 08:14.633
post a photo with you, just to,
like, not hurt her feelings,

08:14.633 --> 08:17.567
'cause, like, obviously, I mean,
that did hurt her feelings, you

08:17.567 --> 08:21.400
know that, like...
my little sister is, like, you

08:21.400 --> 08:24.700
know, with her baby dad-- like,
I'm very, like...

08:24.700 --> 08:27.633
like, I understand it, how she
could've been hurt, like,

08:27.633 --> 08:30.333
- totally, like, I'm never...
- But it also it has

08:30.333 --> 08:31.833
nothing to do with you though,
you know?

08:31.833 --> 08:33.533
- Totally.
- That's life, you know

08:33.533 --> 08:35.700
what I mean?
Like, people have to find out

08:35.700 --> 08:37.600
for themselves and go they own
way, you know?

08:37.600 --> 08:40.333
- Totally.
- She's not a bad person,

08:40.333 --> 08:42.500
you know what I mean?
She's not a bad person at all.

08:42.500 --> 08:46.333
When she posted
something about Kylie, I went so

08:46.333 --> 08:49.233
crazy on my brother because I
was, like, "The way we..."

08:49.233 --> 08:50.967
And I know everything was on
speaker.

08:50.967 --> 08:54.800
I was like, "The way we raised,
that is now your girlfriend."

08:54.800 --> 08:56.933
Yeah, it's, like, if he
was, like, not posting anything

08:56.933 --> 08:59.833
from jump, like, about Kylie,
or, like, not doing none of this

08:59.833 --> 09:02.200
stuff, you were only doing it
because you was just trying

09:02.200 --> 09:04.867
to, like, get at me.
Just be in mix all day.

09:04.867 --> 09:08.067
It's not funny, you know what
I'm saying?

09:08.067 --> 09:10.300
It's just the overall one-up
factor.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.667
It's like, "Yo, I won."
But why was he able

09:12.667 --> 09:15.300
to propose in front of her whole
family, but he can't include us?

09:15.300 --> 09:21.067
- I don't know.
- I feel like Rob is

09:21.067 --> 09:23.900
deliberately excluding us from
so many things.

09:23.900 --> 09:28.167
And he almost, like, likes this
wedge that's being put between

09:28.167 --> 09:30.900
us all, which is bizarre to me,
because we didn't grow up that

09:30.900 --> 09:33.167
way.
But whenever Rob needs

09:33.167 --> 09:35.600
something, he'll come back
crawling.

09:35.600 --> 09:41.467
Rob is full of bull
And I can't handle it.

09:41.467 --> 09:44.167
- Oh, yeah!
- Watching Corey

09:44.167 --> 09:48.467
gives me a heart attack.

09:48.467 --> 09:52.067
- I'm okay.
- Look at the sunset.

09:52.067 --> 09:54.700
- I set up an amazing dinner.
- I'm throwing everyone

09:54.700 --> 09:56.800
else under the bus.
No one else is on their way.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.800
If my kids don't give a...

09:58.800 --> 10:01.200
I don't give a.
I'm not doing this anymore.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.233
Rob just wrote me, by the way,
and said, "Call me when you're

10:03.233 --> 10:05.233
alone."
And there's no loyalty

10:05.233 --> 10:07.667
or family unity with him.
It's bizarre.

10:07.667 --> 10:15.967
He's the weak link in the bunch,
and he needs to be cut.

10:15.967 --> 10:18.067
You were only doing it
because you was just trying

10:18.067 --> 10:20.067
to, like, get at me and just
be in the mix all day.

10:20.067 --> 10:22.067
It's not funny, you know what
I'm saying?

10:22.067 --> 10:24.067
- It's the overall...
- Package.

10:24.067 --> 10:26.467
...one-up factor.
It's like, "Yo, I won."

10:26.467 --> 10:29.467
Because of her mind, like--
This is your sister

10:29.467 --> 10:31.667
you're talking about!
Have some respect!

10:31.667 --> 10:33.667
Should I call her?
shouldn't call

10:33.667 --> 10:35.700
- her.
- Why?

10:35.700 --> 10:37.700
Because... you should--
Kim should call her.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.700
She knows I'm the
rational one.

10:39.700 --> 10:41.700
Kim, you're the only
person that can patch all this

10:41.700 --> 10:44.233
stuff up, and you know it.
You're gonna have to.

10:44.233 --> 10:47.467
Right?
You have to, right?

10:47.467 --> 10:49.867
Would you go to the
wedding?

10:49.867 --> 10:53.433
- Look, guys...
- Mom has to.

10:53.433 --> 10:55.867
I'm not g...
We're not going to his wedding

10:55.867 --> 10:57.867
- if he has a wedding...
- But I mean, how

10:57.867 --> 10:59.900
many weddings have we been to in
this family and they don't mean

10:59.900 --> 11:03.167
So, let's all get over it.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.467
- Let's go.
- Let's see you

11:11.467 --> 11:13.000
- like us.
- Which way we going?

11:13.000 --> 11:17.567
- All right.
- Oh, yeah!

11:17.567 --> 11:19.467
Whoa...

11:21.533 --> 11:26.567
- Whoa!
- So good.

11:26.567 --> 11:29.567
Watching Corey
gives me a heart attack.

11:29.567 --> 11:34.700
I know, it's scary.

11:34.700 --> 11:38.800
I'm okay.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.033
- Who wiped out?
- Now I feel safe.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.900
I'm feeling good.
I was going too fast.

11:43.900 --> 11:46.533
- You needed to stop?
- I think I'm just beat

11:46.533 --> 11:51.933
at this point.

11:51.933 --> 11:54.100
All right, I got to pull it
together.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.867
I got to get my Scott
together.

11:56.867 --> 11:59.133
You know, Scott just too cool.
Look how he stands.

11:59.133 --> 12:01.133
He just stands like...
He don't look like he even

12:01.133 --> 12:03.133
- working!
- If you jerk off a

12:03.133 --> 12:05.133
little in the middle, it really
helps out.

12:05.133 --> 12:07.133
Coming through,
Khlo!

12:07.133 --> 12:09.133
Open it up, open it up, open it
up!

12:09.133 --> 12:11.500
I'm coming.

12:11.500 --> 12:15.033
Kim...

12:22.133 --> 12:24.700
You guys, it doesn't
just take like that.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.700
You have to, like, wait for me
to focus.

12:26.700 --> 12:29.567
Okay, d-do it.
Oh!

12:29.567 --> 12:32.333
He's really modeling.

12:32.333 --> 12:36.500
- Kendall!
- Kendall!

12:36.500 --> 12:39.167
Let's put it out there.
Let me see...

12:39.167 --> 12:41.167
So all you have to
do is focus with this big one.

12:41.167 --> 12:42.833
- Focus...
- On me.

12:42.833 --> 12:44.167
- Kendall!
- Well, you got to get,

12:44.167 --> 12:46.167
like, a better view.
Go, like, by the door.

12:46.167 --> 12:48.167
- Okay.
- Just go outside.

12:48.167 --> 12:50.200
- Who, where are they?
- They're, like, right

12:50.200 --> 12:53.767
- down there.
- No, Scott!

12:53.767 --> 12:55.767
- Here's Kendall!
- Kendall!

12:55.767 --> 12:57.500
Here's who you've been
waiting for!

12:57.500 --> 13:00.133
- Oh, my God!
- Here's Kenny!

13:00.133 --> 13:01.567
- Here's Kendall!
- Kendall!

13:01.567 --> 13:04.433
Say hi!
Tyga performs in 20!

13:04.433 --> 13:06.800
Tyga! Tyga!

13:06.800 --> 13:09.867
I love you!
Come down and perform!

13:09.867 --> 13:11.600
- Tyga!
- Tyga!

13:11.600 --> 13:13.467
- I love you!
- I can't believe you're

13:13.467 --> 13:15.500
really performing in 20 minutes.
not

13:15.500 --> 13:17.567
- doing.
- Yo, tell them to flash

13:17.567 --> 13:19.800
us.
Are they old enough?

13:19.800 --> 13:22.767
How old are you guys?
Flash us.

13:29.767 --> 13:32.333
Adventure Ridge.
See, those are the names of all

13:32.333 --> 13:34.767
- the runs.
- Oh, okay.

13:34.767 --> 13:37.167
- Oh, okay.
- Hi.

13:37.167 --> 13:40.100
- Watch your step.
- This is nice.

13:40.100 --> 13:42.867
I haven't been up here in so
long.

13:42.867 --> 13:47.033
It's so pretty.
I've set up an amazing dinner on

13:47.033 --> 13:50.800
top of the mountain at the most
beautiful restaurant.

13:50.800 --> 13:54.000
I want to take the family up and
enjoy the sunset.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.467
- Here we are.
- Oh, we're here!

13:57.467 --> 14:00.067
- Wow, wow, wow, wow.
- It's so good.

14:00.067 --> 14:02.067
- Thank you.
- Look at the sun

14:02.067 --> 14:04.067
- setting.
- Wow!

14:04.067 --> 14:06.067
- Are you serious?
- Look at this.

14:06.067 --> 14:08.500
- We're on top of the world.
- Wow.

14:08.500 --> 14:11.633
- It's stunning.
- Look at that sunset.

14:11.633 --> 14:15.800
- Honest to God.
- We love you guys.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.367
- Love you.
- To the best trip.

14:18.367 --> 14:24.667
And good night.

14:24.667 --> 14:28.600
You've got to be kidding me.
"Hi, Kris.

14:28.600 --> 14:34.533
I saw that Rob and Angela, aka
Chyna, got engaged and I was

14:34.533 --> 14:37.200
wondering if you can forward my
e-mail below over to Rob for

14:37.200 --> 14:40.133
consideration.
As you already know, I'm the

14:40.133 --> 14:43.067
best wedding videographer in
Northern California.

14:43.067 --> 14:44.200
- No.
- No!

14:44.200 --> 14:46.567
"I just thought I would
out first, thanks."

14:46.567 --> 14:49.933
- That's crazy.
- Oh, my God.

14:49.933 --> 14:53.767
Are we waiting for a
few others to show up for

14:53.767 --> 14:56.300
- dinner?
- That's the $10 million

14:56.300 --> 14:59.300
question.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.300
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.333
I'm throwing everyone
else under the bus.

15:03.333 --> 15:06.500
No one else is on their way.
I'm dressed and ready to go.

15:06.500 --> 15:09.400
I was totally on my way.
And I just think by the time we

15:09.400 --> 15:11.533
get there, it's so dark
already...

15:11.533 --> 15:14.267
Okay, well, until we
start doing these family

15:14.267 --> 15:17.333
vacations so it's really a
family vacation, then I'm not

15:17.333 --> 15:20.333
- doing this anymore.
- I swear, I was literally

15:20.333 --> 15:22.433
on my way.
We all should've done it

15:22.433 --> 15:24.433
together.
I love you and I promise I'll

15:24.433 --> 15:26.633
make it up to you.
I swear.

15:26.633 --> 15:31.400
I've gone to so much
trouble, and if my kids don't

15:31.400 --> 15:34.400
five a ,
then I don't give a.

15:34.400 --> 15:39.567
I don't care anymore.
They're just idiots.

15:39.567 --> 15:41.600
She's gonna carry on
the legacy.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.600
I could change my
kids' last name.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.733
What the
I'm sitting right here!

15:45.733 --> 15:47.733
I could just see that
her guards are getting let down,

15:47.733 --> 15:49.733
and Kourtney's now having more
fun.

15:52.167 --> 15:54.400
'My family didn't know jack
about my engagement.'

15:54.400 --> 15:56.700
As reported, none of the women
"jumped on social media to

15:56.700 --> 15:58.967
congratulate him."
And no one should,

15:58.967 --> 16:08.600
because that's so desperate and
fake of whoever does first.

16:08.600 --> 16:14.033
Opa! Opa!

16:14.033 --> 16:17.000
Do we actually want to
go bowling or no?

16:17.000 --> 16:20.033
- Yeah, why not?
- Oh, hey.

16:20.033 --> 16:22.567
- Gonna join us?
- Fancy Nancy strikes

16:22.567 --> 16:24.600
- again.
- Are you not going

16:24.600 --> 16:26.900
- to Mom's?
- No, I felt so guilty.

16:26.900 --> 16:29.433
Why didn't you go
meet with Mom?

16:29.433 --> 16:31.633
Because it was gonna be
too dark and this sounded

16:31.633 --> 16:35.000
better, to be honest.
My mom planned this big dinner

16:35.000 --> 16:38.533
at the top of a mountain, and
truly, I woke up this morning,

16:38.533 --> 16:42.067
worked out, then went skiing,
then, you know, took my daughter

16:42.067 --> 16:45.433
skiing, so I've had a full day.
So we decided to just eat at the

16:45.433 --> 16:47.833
restaurant that's right inside
of the hotel.

16:47.833 --> 16:49.900
It's just easier.
She's also there with her

16:49.900 --> 16:51.900
friends, so I don't think she
would mind.

16:51.900 --> 16:54.067
Like, I don't know why she's so
disappointed.

16:54.067 --> 16:56.167
Should one of us
call Rob?

16:56.167 --> 16:59.700
I don't want to call
our brother.

16:59.700 --> 17:02.967
That's how you're
feeling, but guess what?

17:02.967 --> 17:06.600
How many are there of us?
You feel like you don't want to

17:06.600 --> 17:09.300
talk to him.
Good for you.

17:09.300 --> 17:11.500
I feel like he chose--
I feel like I'd

17:11.500 --> 17:14.933
like to-- Actually I really,
really don't even care.

17:14.933 --> 17:17.033
- So, at a normal...
- How the  are

17:17.033 --> 17:19.033
you gonna say you don't even
care?

17:19.033 --> 17:21.033
She's gonna carry
on the legacy.

17:21.033 --> 17:23.367
- If she has a boy?
- I could change my

17:23.367 --> 17:25.900
- kids' last name.
- What the!

17:25.900 --> 17:28.067
I'm sitting right here, you
sick!

17:28.067 --> 17:30.300
Wait, all-all your
guys' kids last name is

17:30.300 --> 17:32.033
- Disick, right?
- Yeah.

17:32.033 --> 17:33.700
Yeah, this bitch just
said I'm gonna try to

17:33.700 --> 17:35.433
change 'em.
could

17:35.433 --> 17:37.467
- change my kids' last name...
- You could?

17:37.467 --> 17:39.467
What the  is wrong with
you?

17:39.467 --> 17:41.967
So that she
couldn't have the last name.

17:41.967 --> 17:45.133
- It's a joke.
- I remember you guys

17:45.133 --> 17:47.267
saying, you know what, we're
gonna try snowboarding, and then

17:47.267 --> 17:50.600
Kourtney decided to fall, and
what happened?

17:50.600 --> 17:53.133
- I broke my arm.
- You broke your arm.

17:53.133 --> 17:55.400
Within, like, the
first five minutes of

17:55.400 --> 17:57.467
- snowboarding.
- Full cast?

17:57.467 --> 17:58.967
Yeah, full cast.
Yeah, I did.

17:58.967 --> 18:00.333
No, that's not a real
story.

18:00.333 --> 18:02.300
No, she swears it's
real.

18:02.300 --> 18:04.000
Ask Kim if that's
real.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.867
Kim, is that really
true?

18:05.867 --> 18:07.400
Kourtney actually says that she
fell.

18:07.400 --> 18:09.100
But I had a full
cast.

18:09.100 --> 18:10.833
- We thought that...
- Right, okay, thank

18:10.833 --> 18:12.267
- you, I rest my case.
- We did!

18:12.267 --> 18:13.967
I don't know if it's
true.

18:13.967 --> 18:17.533
It was like 30 years ago.

18:17.533 --> 18:20.967
I know Kourt had a ton
of anxiety in regards to Scott

18:20.967 --> 18:25.633
coming on this trip, which I
totally understand, but the more

18:25.633 --> 18:29.800
that we're on this trip, and
Scott is really proving himself,

18:29.800 --> 18:32.000
I could just see that her guards
are getting let down, and

18:32.000 --> 18:34.067
Kourtney's now having more fun,
and I could see those nerves

18:34.067 --> 18:35.733
are completely leaving her.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.067
Who the  are
you waving at?

18:39.067 --> 18:40.867
- Those kids.
- They didn't wave at

18:40.867 --> 18:42.433
- you.
- Yeah, they were.

18:42.433 --> 18:44.633
No, they weren't.
Now they realize who you are.

18:44.633 --> 18:46.367
- Good.
- Are you insane?

18:46.367 --> 18:47.567
- No.
- Those kids didn't wave

18:47.567 --> 18:48.967
- you.
- They were waving

18:48.967 --> 18:50.067
- at us.
- No, they didn't.

18:50.067 --> 18:51.700
- Yeah, they were.
- I'm gonna ask them.

18:51.700 --> 18:53.200
- Let's cheers.
- To what?

18:53.200 --> 18:55.333
- To what?
- To, um...

18:55.333 --> 19:00.133
just cheers to being blessed,
having a... a great family.

19:00.133 --> 19:01.800
"Being blessed and
having a great family."

19:01.800 --> 19:03.167
- Yeah.
- And you guys really

19:03.167 --> 19:05.900
don't realize that, I'm on the
outside looking in, but, like,

19:05.900 --> 19:08.033
you guys have a really solid
family.

19:08.033 --> 19:11.200
The family value is so strong,
you know?

19:11.200 --> 19:13.900
Like... it's just a great thing.
Not a lot of people have

19:13.900 --> 19:15.800
families like that, you know,
so, like...

19:15.800 --> 19:18.433
Here's to family.
Toast to Kris Jenner.

19:18.433 --> 19:20.400
Toast to Kris
Jenner for setting up this

19:20.400 --> 19:22.800
- secret trip for us.
- Yes.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.667
Kim here can feel
it.

19:24.667 --> 19:27.300
And just, like,
doing this for all of us.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.233
Doing the damn thing.

19:29.233 --> 19:30.967
Doing the damn
thing.

19:30.967 --> 19:39.033
Yeah.♪ ♪

19:39.033 --> 19:41.900
Wait, this is like the
nicest bowling alley I've ever

19:41.900 --> 19:45.433
- seen.
- Back here?

19:45.433 --> 19:47.700
Mother.
How do you...

19:47.700 --> 19:49.633
Where's the pin
master?

19:49.633 --> 19:51.167
- Who's up?
- Come on, Kim!

19:51.167 --> 19:52.867
I believe in you!

19:54.533 --> 19:58.200
Yay, Kim!

19:58.200 --> 20:00.033
What?
There you go.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.400
- Can I do it?
- Yeah.

20:02.400 --> 20:06.567
Oh, yeah, Ye!

20:06.567 --> 20:09.700
I told you!
It's rigged.

20:09.700 --> 20:12.767
- All right.
- Whoa. Oh, oh.

20:12.767 --> 20:15.567
- Can he be out?
- Oh, yeah.

20:15.567 --> 20:18.633
- The Tootsie Roll, yeah.
- I got a strike.

20:18.633 --> 20:21.000
Oh, you did?
I didn't even get to see you get

20:21.000 --> 20:22.800
- a strike!
- This is  bull

20:22.800 --> 20:24.233
No. Yeah!

20:24.233 --> 20:26.933
This girl's twerking
all over town now!

20:26.933 --> 20:30.367
- I'm over here striking 'em out!
- Ow.

20:30.367 --> 20:32.333
- Did it work?
- Yeah.

20:32.333 --> 20:34.367
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, come on!

20:34.367 --> 20:37.367
Who's winning?
Pablo?

20:37.367 --> 20:38.700
- Pablo.
- Pablo, Pablo, Pablo,

20:38.700 --> 20:40.267
- Pablo.
- How are you on the

20:40.267 --> 20:41.633
- trip?
- Good. Especially now,

20:41.633 --> 20:43.033
that your boobs are directly in
face.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.767
"Let me ask you,

20:44.767 --> 20:46.133
how are you feeling?"
Do you get

20:46.133 --> 20:47.600
uncomfortable that we're all
drinking?

20:47.600 --> 20:50.200
- Nah.
- I don't care about that.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.667
- Like, is it rude?
- No!

20:52.667 --> 20:54.867
I-I would think it would be
weird if people didn't.

20:54.867 --> 20:58.000
- I don't not drink, but...
- I know, but not around

20:58.000 --> 20:59.700
- Kourt, right?
- Yeah.

20:59.700 --> 21:01.033
Why, 'cause there's
too much...

21:01.033 --> 21:02.700
No, I just told her I
wouldn't.

21:02.700 --> 21:04.300
Oh, right, but she
knows you do.

21:04.300 --> 21:05.700
Yeah.
I don't lie to her about

21:05.700 --> 21:07.067
- anything anymore.
- Good.

21:07.067 --> 21:09.967
Ever, even if she asks
me, like, the weirdest.

21:09.967 --> 21:12.000
Hmm, easier that way,
you don't have to remember it.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.467
- Ah, never.
- Does it bother you

21:13.467 --> 21:15.400
- that she drinks now?
- No,  it, I

21:15.400 --> 21:17.233
- always want her to lighten up.
- Yeah, but just, like,

21:17.233 --> 21:19.733
- is it awkward ever?
- I mean, of course.

21:19.733 --> 21:21.467
But, like I can't
imagine you not being here.

21:21.467 --> 21:23.967
Yeah, no, I mean,
listen, it's been, like,

21:23.967 --> 21:26.267
amazing to be able to be around
everybody, and the kids,

21:26.267 --> 21:30.433
especially.
One of the biggest issues

21:30.433 --> 21:34.467
between Kourtney and I for a
long time was me drinking and,

21:34.467 --> 21:37.667
a lot of times, I think I get
overly emotional when I drink,

21:37.667 --> 21:40.067
and that's a lot of the times
when Kourtney and I would fight,

21:40.067 --> 21:44.467
and I told her, on this trip,
I just wouldn't drink.

21:44.467 --> 21:48.433
I just want her to see that
I can keep it together.

21:48.433 --> 21:50.333
- Scott?
- Huh?

21:50.333 --> 21:52.133
- Avocado?
- Oh, thanks.

21:52.133 --> 21:53.567
Oh, she made you
a plate.

21:53.567 --> 21:55.600
- Oh, wow, ho...
- Amazing, you talk to

21:55.600 --> 21:57.033
me for two minutes, she makes me
a plate.

21:57.033 --> 21:58.400
She made you
food.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.433
- It's unbelievable.
- Get another one, Pab.

22:01.433 --> 22:12.900
Oh! Shoot!

22:12.900 --> 22:14.500
- Scott.
- Huh?

22:14.500 --> 22:16.100
- Hey.
- Holy.

22:16.100 --> 22:18.000
You, like, have a glam room
on a ski trip.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Don't you guys feel like this
is gonna, like, kind of make you

22:20.000 --> 22:22.300
- look a little insane?
- We are insane.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.833
My
family didn't know jack about my

22:24.833 --> 22:29.233
engagement."
This is on TMZ, so it's all of

22:29.233 --> 22:33.233
our faces and it says, "Rob
Kardashian blindsided his family

22:33.233 --> 22:35.733
not giving them the heads up or
even a hint about his

22:35.733 --> 22:37.633
engagement.
Sources familiar with the

22:37.633 --> 22:40.767
situation tell us Rob went to
great lengths to keep Kim and

22:40.767 --> 22:44.067
company in the dark.
The women are not taking kindly

22:44.067 --> 22:47.300
to being squeezed out, and as we
reported, none of the women

22:47.300 --> 22:50.600
jumped on social media to
congratulate him."

22:50.600 --> 22:53.600
Why would we
congratulate him?

22:53.600 --> 22:56.433
And no one should congratulate
them.

22:56.433 --> 22:59.533
That's so desperate and fake of
whoever does first, 'cause I

22:59.533 --> 23:02.400
- know someone's gonna break.
- Tyga tweeted

23:02.400 --> 23:05.267
- something.
- Saying what?

23:05.267 --> 23:07.333
He said, "Everyone
deserves to be happy. What

23:07.333 --> 23:09.767
someone does for their happiness
is not my concern as long as

23:09.767 --> 23:12.967
it's not interfering with my
happiness."

23:12.967 --> 23:15.200
All the comments are like,
"Don't care anymore."

23:15.200 --> 23:17.467
They're not bashing him anymore,
they're just like, "Oh, okay,

23:17.467 --> 23:19.133
he doesn't care? Good, we don't
care."

23:19.133 --> 23:22.433
People are trying to make it
this big feud and it's just...

23:22.433 --> 23:25.500
it is what it is, like, we just
want Rob to be happy.

23:25.500 --> 23:28.867
I just feel like the world
thinks that we care so much and

23:28.867 --> 23:31.867
they're making it this huge, big
deal, when in reality, none of

23:31.867 --> 23:35.533
us really care, we just want Rob
to be able to tell us when he's

23:35.533 --> 23:38.567
gonna do something so big like
this.

23:38.567 --> 23:40.800
If people know that we actually
don't care...

23:40.800 --> 23:42.633
As soon as no one
cares about them, it's gonna

23:42.633 --> 23:45.867
fizzle out.
God.

23:45.867 --> 23:48.233
No matter what we do,
we can't control what-what's

23:48.233 --> 23:52.233
- gonna happen between them.
- I know that Kylie feels

23:52.233 --> 23:55.433
like silence sometimes can, you
know, drag it on longer, and I

23:55.433 --> 23:57.367
agree.
Part of me wants to address

23:57.367 --> 24:00.133
this, but then on the other
hand, like, I do want to talk to

24:00.133 --> 24:02.367
my brother first.
But, at this point, I don't

24:02.367 --> 24:05.700
really know what to do.
The end of the day, it's his

24:05.700 --> 24:12.900
- life, and...
- His problem.

24:12.900 --> 24:14.933
Where's Kylie?
Tyga's getting on a plane 'cause

24:14.933 --> 24:17.400
he has to go on tour, and so I'm
just gonna hop on the plane with

24:17.400 --> 24:19.900
him.
Bye, guys, love you.

24:19.900 --> 24:22.767
- Bye, mom.
- Did you see what she

24:22.767 --> 24:24.367
just wrote?
How we weren't invited to the

24:24.367 --> 24:26.167
- wedding?
- I hope that, you know,

24:26.167 --> 24:29.133
everyone can just get along,
but it's really hard when we see

24:29.133 --> 24:31.867
Chyna's mom posting things about
us.

24:31.867 --> 24:37.067
Why did she even
comment?

24:45.133 --> 24:49.533
Where's Kylie?
We're so late, let's go.

24:49.533 --> 24:52.733
As much fun as I'm having, I
have to get home because I have

24:52.733 --> 24:55.167
a trip for work, and I know
Tyga's getting on a plane 'cause

24:55.167 --> 24:57.667
he has to go on tour, and so I'm
just gonna hop on the plane with

24:57.667 --> 24:59.600
him and Kylie to prepare for
that.

24:59.600 --> 25:04.733
Bye, guys, love you.
Bye, Lauren.

25:04.733 --> 25:21.433
Bye, Mom, I love you.
Bye.

25:21.433 --> 25:23.133
- Khloe?
- Yeah.

25:23.133 --> 25:25.833
One time, we were on
this, um, house boat.

25:25.833 --> 25:29.433
- Oh, geez.
- And your dad went-went

25:29.433 --> 25:30.900
- jet skiing.
- Yeah.

25:30.900 --> 25:33.667
But he, like, two hours
later, never came back.

25:33.667 --> 25:35.433
Oh, God, I remember
that.

25:35.433 --> 25:38.733
And we all could not
find him, and I was, like,

25:38.733 --> 25:40.767
- three, four months pregnant.
- That's so scary.

25:40.767 --> 25:43.167
Yeah, it was scary.
And they were trying to calm me

25:43.167 --> 25:46.500
down, and I'm like "You guys
don't understand, my baby's not

25:46.500 --> 25:49.433
gonna have a dad."
Oh, baby.

25:49.433 --> 25:52.267
God, I wonder where
Kylie gets her dramatics from.

25:52.267 --> 25:54.800
- Oh.
- I wonder where you get

25:54.800 --> 25:56.367
- your dramatics from.
- I was thinking the

25:56.367 --> 25:58.567
- exact same thing, but I was...
- You were on the other

25:58.567 --> 25:59.700
- boat, barking.
- I was gonna keep my

25:59.700 --> 26:01.567
mouth shut.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.933
How are you?
Did you get the video I sent

26:17.733 --> 26:18.900

- Hey, Mom.

26:24.633 --> 26:25.733
- Hi.
- Is she sleeping?

26:25.733 --> 26:26.933
- Yeah.

26:26.933 --> 26:30.067

26:30.067 --> 26:32.967
dinner the other night, when you
wanted us to all come out, I

26:32.967 --> 26:38.733
just want to say that, you know,
we're really sorry.

26:38.733 --> 26:40.933
It's something to really
appreciate having this, like,

26:40.933 --> 26:42.700
big family and a big support
system.

26:42.700 --> 26:45.000
Sometimes we take it for
granted.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.833
And I know my mom planned this
dinner and she's probably so

26:47.833 --> 26:50.567
upset about Rob, and I feel like
we should have gone, and I feel

26:50.567 --> 26:53.700
really guilty, 'cause we should
just like be there and be this,

26:53.700 --> 26:56.700
like, emotional support for her
and have a good time.

26:56.700 --> 26:59.267
This has been such a fun trip.
Don't you guys think?

26:59.267 --> 27:00.800
- Yeah.
- Yeah, super fun.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.500

- Well, I was just

29:58.500 --> 30:00.500
pissed about the show.
It wasn't my vision anymore.

30:00.500 --> 30:02.500
I don't think you

30:02.500 --> 30:04.533
Like, I'm a person that's really
particular about production and

30:04.533 --> 30:07.867
the table has to be like this,
but when I was at Adidas, when

30:07.867 --> 30:09.867
we were gonna do the first
shoe, I didn't want to put it

30:09.867 --> 30:11.867

I didn't like the shoe.

It's bizarre.
he's just-- that's his

31:27.533 --> 31:29.533
- personality.
- He's the weak link in

31:29.533 --> 31:31.533
the bunch, and he needs to be
cut.

31:31.533 --> 31:33.867
- Let's get a new link.
- The mom whole

31:33.867 --> 31:37.100
animosity is at you two.
And that's what I don't, I don't

31:37.100 --> 31:39.433
- like.
- Did you see what she

31:39.433 --> 31:42.100
just wrote about all of us and
how we weren't invited to the

31:42.100 --> 31:44.133
- wedding?
- Why does she even

31:44.133 --> 31:46.133
- comment?
- Both me and Kim have

31:46.133 --> 31:48.133
been in situations where we with
someone that all of our friends

31:48.133 --> 31:50.467
- hated.
- And family.

31:50.467 --> 31:54.000
I've definitely been in a
situation before where my family

31:54.000 --> 31:57.367
hasn't always approved, so I
know what he must feel, and he

31:57.367 --> 32:00.967
probably doesn't want to reach
out, thinking that we are being

32:00.967 --> 32:04.267
judgmental, so I think maybe I
should make the first move?

32:04.267 --> 32:08.467
I think I want to write Rob to
put an end to...

32:08.467 --> 32:11.933
- like, the beef.
- I commend Kim for

32:11.933 --> 32:15.533
wanting to reach out to Rob.
I mean, I... it's huge on her

32:15.533 --> 32:17.600
part.
I wouldn't reach out just

32:17.600 --> 32:19.900
because I'm stubborn, and I just
don't really give a.

32:19.900 --> 32:21.900
I think I would even
start and explain like, "Look,

32:21.900 --> 32:23.900
I'm not, like, an idiot, like--"
I have no tolerance

32:23.900 --> 32:26.233
for him.
It's nuts that Rob doesn't care

32:26.233 --> 32:27.467
to say something.
Like, you're our brother.

32:27.467 --> 32:30.767
The psychic wrote me
that exact thing today.

32:30.767 --> 32:33.000
- Who said that?
- The psychic texted me

32:33.000 --> 32:35.367
and says, "Hey, I'm in the
airport, and I see on the

32:35.367 --> 32:38.167
magazines and I'm, like, on the
TV what's going on...

32:38.167 --> 32:41.300
your brother..."
Well, why does he need

32:41.300 --> 32:46.567
to see that, if he's a psychic?

32:55.600 --> 32:58.133
I got to tell you, you
look very sexy with your beard

32:58.133 --> 33:00.267
- trimmed down.
- You like that?

33:00.267 --> 33:02.900
Thank you, thank you.

33:02.900 --> 33:05.800
So, do you, like, do
you know long the sled, the, uh,

33:05.800 --> 33:07.900
- sled riders...?
- Snowmobiling?

33:07.900 --> 33:09.567
It's probably an hour,
hour and a half.

33:09.567 --> 33:10.900
It's probably
up to us; kind of, like,

33:10.900 --> 33:12.233
- whenever you're bored.
- I feel like

33:12.233 --> 33:13.900
I remember doing this.
You go up to, like, a beautiful

33:13.900 --> 33:15.900
like, summit, where you can see,
like, a beautiful view...

33:15.900 --> 33:17.600
You don't think
anybody's gonna take pics

33:17.600 --> 33:19.600
- and snapshots?
- I mean, what else is

33:19.600 --> 33:21.600
- there to do when you're on a...
- Nothing!

33:21.600 --> 33:23.633
Nothing-- and then I
think there's probably, like, a

33:23.633 --> 33:25.633
big open field where you just,
like, let loose and go, like, 60

33:25.633 --> 33:27.767
- miles an hour and have fun.
- You just sold the

33:27.767 --> 33:29.433
- living hell out of that.
- Right?

33:29.433 --> 33:31.433
Do you work for the
snowmobile company?

33:31.433 --> 33:33.433
So, I'm actually
offering coupons for next season

33:33.433 --> 33:35.433
if you get it now--
And you're like,

33:35.433 --> 33:37.433
"Guess what-- you can save 15%
if you switch to..."

33:37.433 --> 33:38.767
If you go to Kawasaki,
yeah.

33:38.767 --> 33:40.433
- ...snowmobiles.
- There's about 62 more

33:40.433 --> 33:42.433
horsepower in the Kawasaki
versus the Yamaha.

33:42.433 --> 33:44.433
And fuel efficiency
is far superior.

33:44.433 --> 33:46.100
- Really.
- I'm not gonna go 60

33:46.100 --> 33:47.767
- miles an hour on it.
- I don't think I'm

33:47.767 --> 33:49.767
- going up the thing.
- Just do every--

33:49.767 --> 33:51.900
just go fast-- the faster you
go, the safer you are.

33:51.900 --> 33:54.333
You got to jump.
You got to go fast, all right?

33:54.333 --> 33:56.333
- He's right.
- Maybe you should stay

33:56.333 --> 33:58.600
home.
I'm getting worried.

34:11.967 --> 34:13.967
- Hold on.
- And personal

34:13.967 --> 34:15.967
preference, would you like the
open face or would you like

34:15.967 --> 34:17.967
- closed face?
- What do you think-- the

34:17.967 --> 34:19.967
open face or this?
Maybe the closed face.

34:19.967 --> 34:22.533
- I want a closed face.
- Today, we're all going

34:22.533 --> 34:24.867
snowmobiling.
I love doing all these fun

34:24.867 --> 34:27.867
family activities together.
It's been like the perfect trip.

34:27.867 --> 34:31.667
Hmm-hmm.
- Mase, you ready?

34:31.667 --> 34:35.000
- Let's head out.
- Okay, look, I'm gonna

34:35.000 --> 34:37.300
sit here, and you can sit with
me, okay?

34:37.300 --> 34:39.500
How'd you get the
water in?

34:39.500 --> 34:43.433
Here, you want me to
give you some?

34:43.433 --> 34:45.967
- Everybody ready?
- Yeah, we ready.

34:56.200 --> 34:59.167
- Whoa! Whoa!
- What's wrong, sweetie?

34:59.167 --> 35:01.533
- But I'm singing.
- Oh, you're singing.

35:01.533 --> 35:03.467
Oh, I thought you were crying.

35:05.900 --> 35:08.100
- I won.
- I think the

35:08.100 --> 35:10.600
snowmobiling is definitely one
of the highlights of the trip.

35:10.600 --> 35:14.200
It's really, really quite
amazing for all of us to be in

35:14.200 --> 35:17.733
like one pack together going up
this beautiful mountain.

35:17.733 --> 35:21.033
It's a really great time to get
out of your own head, I think,

35:21.033 --> 35:24.200
and just be able to let go of
everything else that's

35:24.200 --> 35:27.367
- happening.
- Two, three...

your mom and I used to take all
of you guys skiing...

36:30.300 --> 36:31.900
Mm-hmm.

literally an hour and a half to
get you guys dressed.

...then we put on a cotton
turtleneck, a sweater over that,

overalls, the ski socks.
I mean, 75 pieces of clothing.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.200
fun today, but I really wish
Kendall and Kylie would've come.

36:51.200 --> 36:54.500
I always miss whoever's not
here, just like I miss it when

36:54.500 --> 36:56.533
Rob isn't here all the time.

36:57.933 --> 37:00.367
I haven't spoken to Rob since I
heard the news about his

37:00.367 --> 37:04.100
engagement and, it's hard
because, you know what?

37:04.100 --> 37:07.967
He's my son and I want him to be
really, really happy.

I just don't know what to do.
It's making me a little bit sad.

37:18.367 --> 37:24.633
That's what moms do.
Moms worry, and moms love, and

37:24.633 --> 37:26.700
moms miss their kids.

37:30.267 --> 37:32.967
Like, minus the little
Rob drama, it was such a good

37:32.967 --> 37:35.333
trip.
Like, everyone was having fun.

37:35.333 --> 37:37.733
I reached out to Rob.
I think it's time that we

37:37.733 --> 37:45.000
talked, so now, you know, I'm
just waiting for him to respond.

gonna play.
I'm gonna play one round.

38:32.533 --> 38:35.867
here in Vail, and, when we used
to come years ago, all the kids

38:35.867 --> 38:38.667
would, like, play kid games and
then downstairs, the adults

38:38.667 --> 38:42.367
would play adult games that we
couldn't be around for, so it's

38:42.367 --> 38:46.200
fun that now we're older and
we're playing games.

38:46.200 --> 38:48.333
Let's see what it
comes down to at the end.

38:48.333 --> 38:50.733
- I can't hear. What?
- The fact that, with our

38:50.733 --> 38:53.633
own kids and our own families,
we can really carry on these

38:53.633 --> 38:57.500

42:11.133 --> 42:12.833
- mountain, so...
- I would choose hot

42:12.833 --> 42:15.633
- over cold any day.
- Kind of surprised

42:15.633 --> 42:18.733
- Kourtney and them stayed.
- We haven't been to

42:18.733 --> 42:22.167
Vail in so long, and they both,
I mean, were having a good time,

42:22.167 --> 42:24.867
and the kids.
She wants the kids to, like, get

42:24.867 --> 42:26.967
those memories.
She said it was really good for

42:26.967 --> 42:29.133
- them.
- Scott was in such a

42:29.133 --> 42:31.833
good mood today, yesterday, and
the day before.

42:31.833 --> 42:33.867
I've never seen him have so much
fun.

42:33.867 --> 42:36.833
Like, he was doing everything
he loves to do.

42:36.833 --> 42:38.567
I'm just happy
everyone's getting along.

42:38.567 --> 42:42.600
- That's all I care about.
- The only thing that

42:42.600 --> 42:44.900
will always be missing is Rob.

42:51.200 --> 42:53.733
Like, minus the little
Rob drama, it was such a good

42:53.733 --> 42:57.867
trip.
Like, everyone was having fun.

42:57.867 --> 43:00.933
This trip has been so amazing,
even though there's been some

43:00.933 --> 43:03.467
drama with Rob.
So now that we're, you know,

43:03.467 --> 43:06.400
on our way home and back to
reality, I, you know, I reached

43:06.400 --> 43:08.333
out to Rob.
I think it's time that we

43:08.333 --> 43:11.067
talked, so now, you know, I'm
just waiting for him to respond

43:11.067 --> 43:17.967
and the ball is really in his
court.

43:17.967 --> 43:21.233
- On the next episode...
- Friday is the Lip Kit

43:21.233 --> 43:23.900
- launch.
- I know, it's so soon.

43:23.900 --> 43:26.900
I am stressing out right now.
I really hope that everything

43:26.900 --> 43:29.367
goes perfect.

43:29.367 --> 43:31.267
- Oh.
- Oh my God, you guys,

43:31.267 --> 43:34.000
- you guys.
- You guys obviously know.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.667
We should've just at
least got a text.

43:35.667 --> 43:37.567
If you guys really
wanted to know, you guys

43:37.567 --> 43:40.000
would've said, "Is this true?"
You  idiot,

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
what do you want me to do?
Hold a press conference?

43:42.000 --> 43:43.833
Then there's one more
thing I have to talk to you

43:43.833 --> 43:45.100
guys about.
