I tend to respond to movies

02:09.379 --> 02:10.714
No, I think it's less of a ride

02:10.714 --> 02:15.510

elliptical fever dream.

Tell me I don't need to cancel
my date with George tonight.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.104
Remember that guy in Florida

03:49.104 --> 03:51.690
who got his entire face
eaten off by an alligator

03:51.690 --> 03:53.692

surgery

03:53.692 --> 03:55.360

surfaced

03:55.360 --> 03:58.530
everyone was like "Wait,
this is after the surgery?

03:58.530 --> 04:01.032
What the hell did he look
like before the surgery?"

04:01.032 --> 04:02.659
'Yeah?'

04:02.659 --> 04:04.995
Well, if that guy had a
baby with the elephant man

04:04.995 --> 04:06.830
and that baby got really old

04:06.830 --> 04:09.624

that baby got infected

09:27.776 --> 09:32.238
Now how on earth
would I wrap that up...to go?

09:32.238 --> 09:34.157
In 18 little bags?

09:37.660 --> 09:39.496
Okay, listen, I am not
a man who's accustomed

09:39.496 --> 09:42.415
to paying $600 for anything
I can't drive around in

09:42.415 --> 09:45.084
so I'm having trouble just
walking away from this.

09:45.084 --> 09:48.087
And in such a comfortable shoe.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.507
Ha ha.
You know what?

09:50.507 --> 09:55.345
On second thought,
I guess I'm eating for two.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.889
If you don't mind.

09:57.889 --> 10:01.309
I had no idea that his
ghost was gonna come back

10:01.309 --> 10:04.020
for 45 minutes as an eel.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.772
Was that an eel?

10:05.772 --> 10:08.191
Wait. You didn't love the movie?

10:08.191 --> 10:09.818
I didn't love that movie.

10:09.818 --> 10:12.654
I didn't like that movie, even a
little bit.

10:12.654 --> 10:16.491
I thought it was terrible.

10:16.491 --> 10:17.951
I'm sorry I suggested it.

10:17.951 --> 10:21.162
How can you say that?
It changed my life.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.455
It..

10:22.455 --> 10:24.290
There was a 5-minute part

10:24.290 --> 10:26.167
that was nothing
but the little boy

10:26.167 --> 10:28.211
staring at a dead fish.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.630
That dead fish
was the boy's mother.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.923
How do you know that?

10:31.923 --> 10:33.800
How do you not know that?

10:33.800 --> 10:36.761
<i> Valentine's Day was slipping
through our fingers.</i>

10:36.761 --> 10:39.514
<i> Unless Ryan and I could
find some common ground.</i>

10:39.514 --> 10:42.183
Hey, how do you.. how do you
feel about stopping by Cody's?

10:42.183 --> 10:45.478
I could.. I could really
use a rager right now.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.231
Come on. We can..

10:48.231 --> 10:51.651
...tell his mom
how sexy she is.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.779
You go ahead.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.698
I feel like walking the earth.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.368
[instrumental music]

11:08.835 --> 11:10.753
[siren wailing at distance]

11:23.349 --> 11:25.935
It's been a while, Mrs. Shay.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.604
Indeed it has.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.647
Indeed it has.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.407
You're amazing, Mrs. Shay.

11:39.407 --> 11:43.494
Easy, Malik. Take it easy.

11:43.494 --> 11:46.623
I missed your chicken salad
so much.

11:46.623 --> 11:49.459
I've missed giving it to you.

11:49.459 --> 11:53.630
There's only one thing
I've missed more than this.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.632
It's Lisa.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.258
I know.

12:00.595 --> 12:03.973
And I know what you need
to do to get her back.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.642
<i> Sheila and Malik
weren't the only ones</i>

12:05.642 --> 12:07.352
<i> avoiding being seen.</i>

12:07.352 --> 12:09.312
<i> Dallas was spending her
Valentine's Day</i>

12:09.312 --> 12:10.939
<i> hiding in the shadows.</i>

12:10.939 --> 12:12.565
'Hello?'

12:12.565 --> 12:15.026
- 'Dallas?'
- Tessa, is that you?

12:15.026 --> 12:17.987
It's really dark in here.
Do you mind if I..

12:17.987 --> 12:19.530
Freeze!

12:19.530 --> 12:21.658
I'm just not in the
mood for direct lighting.

12:21.658 --> 12:24.744
Okay. I was on a date
with Ryan tonight.

12:24.744 --> 12:29.082
And the whole thing was my idea

12:29.082 --> 12:31.125
but I realized halfway
through I didn't like it

12:31.125 --> 12:33.086
and he really liked it

12:33.086 --> 12:37.048
and he got all mad at me
because I wasn't into it.

12:37.048 --> 12:39.801
If we're talkin' about what
I think we're talkin' about

12:39.801 --> 12:42.345
if they can't get you
there even once

12:42.345 --> 12:44.681
their whole world
comes crashing down.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.557
And it's like, we understand.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.559
I'm talking about a movie.

12:48.559 --> 12:51.020
Oh. Then I don't know
what his problem is.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.606
Just because we didn't have
the same exact experience

12:53.606 --> 12:56.985
he got mad and he walked away.

12:56.985 --> 13:00.196
And now I'm alone
on Valentine's Day.

13:00.196 --> 13:03.783
Y'all are discovering
you have differences.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.451
That doesn't mean it's the end.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.120
It means it's a beginning.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.621
- It does?
- Yes.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.123
You're learning
how to navigate

13:10.123 --> 13:13.376
through the lumps and the
bumps and the flaky parts

13:13.376 --> 13:15.712
and the...swollen sections

13:15.712 --> 13:19.090
filled with fluids,
just beggin' to be lanced.

13:19.090 --> 13:20.425
Okay. Now you're scaring me.

13:20.425 --> 13:25.346
What I'm trying to say is, go
find your man.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.849
I will if you will.

13:27.849 --> 13:29.267
You know what? You're right.

13:29.267 --> 13:30.601
George would love me

13:30.601 --> 13:32.603
whether I looked
like Charlize Theron

13:32.603 --> 13:35.189
or Charlize Theron in "Monster."

13:35.189 --> 13:36.399
Right?

13:39.110 --> 13:41.112
And you tried icing it?

13:42.488 --> 13:44.198
Whoo. That was a workout.

13:44.198 --> 13:48.119
I'll tell you, Fred Shay,
you have the tango touch.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.915
Well. What have we here?

13:52.915 --> 13:55.668
In keeping with the Spanish
theme of our evening

13:55.668 --> 13:58.796
I have made some mini churros
with chocolate sauce.

13:58.796 --> 14:01.257
Mrs. Shay. What decadence.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.092
'Keep it in your pants, Fred.
They're oven-baked.'

14:03.092 --> 14:05.720
Though I did use a heavy
hand on the cinnamon shaker.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.139
- So..
- Ow!

14:08.139 --> 14:10.433
I think all that abrazo-ing
is causing me to cramp up.

14:10.433 --> 14:14.270
Oh, sorry, honey.
Excuse me. Allow me.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.022
- Oh! Boy.
- Is it too deep?

14:16.022 --> 14:18.441
Nope. You get in there, Gam Gam.

14:18.441 --> 14:20.610
Oh, you dig as deep as you dare.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.320
Oh, that's the stuff.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.488
[doorbell rings]

14:24.739 --> 14:26.824
Aah.

14:26.824 --> 14:27.784
Ooh.

14:28.826 --> 14:31.329
Malik. What a surprise.

14:31.329 --> 14:32.371
'Oh.'

14:33.706 --> 14:36.459
Oh.. Oh, yes.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.753
<i> Sheila wasn't the only
one losing her appetite.</i>

14:38.753 --> 14:40.213
'Aah..'

14:40.213 --> 14:41.547
For your 15th course

14:41.547 --> 14:44.884
we present a pork belly
and veal tongue hash

14:44.884 --> 14:47.303
finished with shards of
micro-beak

14:47.303 --> 14:49.180
in a freshly lambed foam.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.307
Lambed? Did you..

14:51.307 --> 14:53.935
It's a verb? Lambed? "To lamb?"

14:53.935 --> 14:55.853
- Who lambed it?
- 'I did.'

14:55.853 --> 14:57.563
I lambed it this morning.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.648
[intense music]

15:00.108 --> 15:04.278
It was an honor to watch you
lamb it.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.988
You're very lucky.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.907
You're very lucky.

15:10.576 --> 15:14.622
Guys, my girl used to
look at me just like that.

15:14.622 --> 15:18.709
Made me feel like number one.
Right? It feels good.

15:18.709 --> 15:23.005
Yeah, but tonight,
she totally...bailed on me

15:23.005 --> 15:25.758
so here I am feeling
like number two.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.678
[laughs]

15:28.678 --> 15:32.682
'Right? Did you get it?
Number two?'

15:32.682 --> 15:34.642
- We get it.
- Yeah.

15:34.642 --> 15:38.396
Okay. Don't mind me.
I'm just drunk and lonely.

15:38.396 --> 15:40.189
George.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.775
Hey! That's her.
That's my girlfriend.

15:42.775 --> 15:43.818
The most beautiful girl
in the world.

15:43.818 --> 15:45.403
Shh. Shh.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.155
Underneath the bag.

15:47.155 --> 15:49.323
George. George, come here.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.869
Hey.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.745
Hey, I didn't wanna
leave you here all alone.

15:54.745 --> 15:56.873
But let's just slip out
without making a scene.

15:56.873 --> 16:01.085
Okay. Hey, take a good look,
folks! But hands off!

16:01.085 --> 16:03.921
This sweet gal is mine!

16:03.921 --> 16:05.256
Come on.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.805
This better be good, mother. I
just got to the valley forge

16:12.805 --> 16:15.266
section and there is a riveting
passage about gangrene.

16:15.266 --> 16:17.018
Hey, Lisa.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.561
Mother, would you please show
this gentleman to the door

16:18.561 --> 16:21.022
and tell him that I do not
wish to be disturbed again?

16:21.022 --> 16:22.899
Young lady,
I think you have shown

16:22.899 --> 16:24.942
quite enough attitude today.

16:24.942 --> 16:26.569
Now if you can't
be polite to Malik

16:26.569 --> 16:29.405
then I am gonna take away
your library privileges.

16:29.405 --> 16:30.656
You know what, Mrs. Shay?

16:30.656 --> 16:32.200
Maybe you should back off.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.618
Excuse me?

16:33.618 --> 16:35.661
I'm sick of hearing the
way you talk to Lisa.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.664
She doesn't deserve that tone.
Nobody does.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.416
I hardly think it is your place

16:40.416 --> 16:42.376
to tell me how to
talk to my own daughter.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.753
You know what?
That's where you're wrong.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.379
You're the one who's
always putting your nose

16:45.379 --> 16:47.089
where it doesn't belong,
like in our relationship.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.758
You know what else?

16:48.758 --> 16:52.220
Your "Chicken salad"? Yeah,
it ain't all that, mama.

16:52.220 --> 16:54.013
Well, if that is how you feel
then I agree with Lisa.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.558
You'd better go. You are no
longer welcome in my home

16:57.558 --> 16:59.018
Mr. Lafrique.

17:13.658 --> 17:15.493
Hey.

17:15.493 --> 17:17.662
I thought you were
out walking the earth.

17:17.662 --> 17:20.122
I came looking for you.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.375
It is Valentine's Day.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.045
This couch is wet.

17:26.045 --> 17:30.341
That's 'cause Cody's mom threw
up on it a few minutes ago.

17:30.341 --> 17:33.135
I'm sorry I walked out on you.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.762
If that movie taught me
anything

17:34.762 --> 17:37.598
it's that we have to
forgive those in the darkness

17:37.598 --> 17:39.892
who don't yet see the light.

17:46.649 --> 17:47.984
Yeah.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.777
And..

17:49.777 --> 17:52.029
I know, in a surprise turn
of events

17:52.029 --> 17:55.199
that you liked
that movie and I didn't.

17:55.199 --> 17:58.286
But maybe that's hat
makes us a cool couple.

17:58.286 --> 18:00.871
We're unpredictable.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.164
Yeah.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.292
And we're both
super good looking.

18:10.006 --> 18:11.590
Happy Valentine's Day.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.759
Happy Valentine's Day.

18:13.759 --> 18:17.555
Okay. So.. What was that part

18:17.555 --> 18:21.350
where the masked guy is bowing
to the horse statue about?

18:21.350 --> 18:22.768
That was about war.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.979
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

18:24.979 --> 18:26.981
What about the monkey running
through the art museum?

18:26.981 --> 18:28.649
That was about freedom.

18:28.649 --> 18:31.319
Whoa. Who knew?

18:35.114 --> 18:36.741
Oh, man.

18:36.741 --> 18:39.535
I think I exceeded the daily
allowance

18:39.535 --> 18:41.954
of animal colon tonight.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.205
You know what? I know I did.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.583
Okay. Easy does it.
Almost there.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.460
Dallas, you know I mean this

18:47.460 --> 18:49.503
in the most respectful way
possible

18:49.503 --> 18:52.548
but you're kind of reminding me
of a serial killer right now.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.216
You gotta show me
what's under the bag.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.886
I will. I just wanna make
sure you don't freak out first.

18:56.886 --> 18:59.680
I ate digestive tract
tonight, okay?

18:59.680 --> 19:01.223
Nothing's gonna
make me freak out.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.808
Just tell me what's going on.

19:02.808 --> 19:05.936
Okay. I had a...procedure

19:05.936 --> 19:08.397
that went a bit awry.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.149
How awry?

19:10.149 --> 19:12.109
Uh..

19:12.109 --> 19:13.402
Okay.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.534
Wow.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.244
What did..

19:22.244 --> 19:23.954
Okay.

19:23.954 --> 19:27.083
You know..

19:27.083 --> 19:28.250
Ooh, wow.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.335
It's bad, isn't it?

19:29.335 --> 19:30.961
It's really bad.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.463
You...you don't have to
change yourself.

19:32.463 --> 19:34.632
Anything about yourself,
you're...to me

19:34.632 --> 19:36.884
you're so sexy, and...and..

19:41.555 --> 19:47.228
And beautiful, and..
Oh, God.

19:47.228 --> 19:48.896
- George?
- Mm-hmm.

19:48.896 --> 19:51.232
You were just tellin' me
that I'm sexy and beautiful.

19:51.232 --> 19:54.443
I...I was, and I will, just..

19:54.443 --> 19:56.112
Oh, God, this isn't
about you, I swear.

19:56.112 --> 20:01.409
It's all the intestines
in my...intestines.

20:01.409 --> 20:03.077
Excuse me.

20:05.162 --> 20:06.664
Are you sure it's not me?

20:06.664 --> 20:08.499
<i>Love, thankfully, is resilient.</i>

20:08.499 --> 20:09.959
<i> It can continue to thrive</i>

20:09.959 --> 20:11.544
<i> in the most unlikely
circumstances.</i>

20:11.544 --> 20:14.046
Malik?

20:14.046 --> 20:16.006
Hey.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.133
Um..

20:18.717 --> 20:22.054
Thanks for standing up
to my mother.

20:22.054 --> 20:25.641
It felt really good
to have you on my side.

20:25.641 --> 20:30.980
And if you're still willing
to give us another chance..

20:30.980 --> 20:33.065
...I want to.

20:33.065 --> 20:37.486
- Really?
- Really.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.488
Happy almost-Presidents' Day.

20:54.462 --> 20:56.213
Mr. Shay?

20:56.213 --> 21:00.301
In tango, one doesn't ask.
One takes.

21:04.555 --> 21:06.348
But what about<i> mi madre?</i>

21:06.348 --> 21:08.142
Screw Gam Gam.

21:08.142 --> 21:09.768
I told her she can
stick her rib eye

21:09.768 --> 21:11.687
where the sun don't shine.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.148
Well, not literally, of course.

21:14.148 --> 21:16.567
I told her goodnight and that
I'd miss her

21:16.567 --> 21:19.153
and to have a safe trip, and
let us know she get in okay.

21:19.153 --> 21:21.238
But she knew what I meant.
