00:08.376 --> 00:10.542
- ¶

00:10.544 --> 00:12.544
- What's up, Phoebe?
- Shhh, quiet.

00:12.546 --> 00:13.612
I'm hiding from Gideon.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.080
- Oh, sorry.
[laughs]

00:15.082 --> 00:17.349
Why are you
hiding from Gideon?!

00:17.351 --> 00:19.051
[smacks face]
Ow.

00:19.053 --> 00:21.453
- Gideon is out of
control these days.

00:21.455 --> 00:23.355
He's constantly
asking me out,

00:23.357 --> 00:24.390
calling me "Boo,"

00:24.392 --> 00:25.457
or "Boo Bear,"

00:25.459 --> 00:27.659
or "Boo Brontosaurus Rex."

00:27.661 --> 00:30.062
- He can't possibly
be worse than Sarah.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.363
Ever since I stopped
dating Allison,

00:31.365 --> 00:33.032
she won't leave
me alone.

00:33.034 --> 00:35.100
So, I had to
break out this.

00:35.102 --> 00:38.003
- [guitar strings twang]

00:38.005 --> 00:39.605
- Chloe's
make-up mirror?

00:39.607 --> 00:40.439
- Yes.

00:40.441 --> 00:41.573
Back when I had a band

00:41.575 --> 00:43.175
and dreamed of
being a rock star,

00:43.177 --> 00:44.943
I was gonna use it
to avoid crazy fans.

00:44.945 --> 00:48.113
Now, I use it to avoid
my craziest fan of all.

00:48.115 --> 00:50.015
- Hey, Max!
- MAX: [gasps]

00:50.017 --> 00:51.183
- You have a crazy fan?

00:51.185 --> 00:53.352
That must
be so annoying.

00:53.354 --> 00:57.089
Anyway, I got you
this little beehive.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.292
- Oh, I get it, Sarah--

01:00.294 --> 01:01.660
because you're
Max's honey.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.395
- Did he say that?!

01:03.397 --> 01:06.231
Did you say that?
[laughs]

01:06.700 --> 01:07.533
- [bees buzzing]

01:07.535 --> 01:08.967
- Are there bees
in that thing?

01:08.969 --> 01:10.102
- Oops! Looks
like there were

01:10.104 --> 01:12.171
a couple of little
guys left in there.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.272
- MAX:
Eeee!

01:13.274 --> 01:15.374
- SARAH:
Come back, my honey!

01:15.376 --> 01:16.108
Sting me, instead!

01:16.110 --> 01:20.045
- Oh, man, maybe Max
does have it worse than me.

01:20.047 --> 01:23.182
- Boo!
- PHOEBE: [screams]

01:24.452 --> 01:27.653
- Get it?
'Cause I'm your "Boo."

01:28.622 --> 01:30.022
- I get it.

01:30.024 --> 01:31.690
Just don't want it.

01:31.692 --> 01:34.059
- Well, you didn't
like that,

01:34.061 --> 01:38.130
but you are going to
love the boolloons.

01:38.132 --> 01:40.199
- The what?

01:42.136 --> 01:45.104
And it's my turn
to hide in my locker.

01:48.375 --> 01:49.308
- Thanks, guys,
for coming along

01:49.310 --> 01:51.677
and helping me drop
off Nora at super camp.

01:51.679 --> 01:55.581
I feel bad that I sat on her
bunkmate, the invisible kid.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.417
- Why didn't I ever
get to go to camp?

01:58.419 --> 02:01.386
- You did. You burnt
the place down.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.424
- BARB:
Where is it?!

02:05.426 --> 02:07.259
Where is it?!

02:08.295 --> 02:09.261
- I can't be sure,

02:09.263 --> 02:12.030
but I think Mom's
looking for something.

02:12.299 --> 02:15.067
- Oh, no, Barb, did Chloe
lose her blanket again?

02:15.069 --> 02:17.002
- I'll go ask
her where she left it.

02:17.004 --> 02:18.704
- Are you mad, child?!

02:19.473 --> 02:21.507
You know how attached
she is to that thing.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.041
- Yeah, last time
it went missing,

02:23.043 --> 02:25.110
she teleported everything
out of the house

02:25.112 --> 02:26.311
to try to find it.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.246
- Including my slide.

02:27.248 --> 02:30.282
I had to use the stairs
like an animal.

02:30.618 --> 02:32.117
- I'm gonna go hide
my homework.

02:32.119 --> 02:34.219
- Where do I hide
them, Phoebe?

02:36.090 --> 02:39.458
- Barb, we panic every time
Chloe loses that blanket.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.060
Maybe there's another way
we can handle this.

02:42.062 --> 02:43.595
- No, when she's
ready to give up

02:43.597 --> 02:44.363
the blanket, she will.

02:44.365 --> 02:47.533
Now make with the muscles
and lift up the couch.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.369
Oh! Found it!

02:50.371 --> 02:52.771
- CHLOE: [whooshing]
Found what?

02:53.607 --> 02:54.473
- The...kitchen...

02:54.475 --> 02:56.275
which is where
we should go into

02:56.277 --> 02:59.111
so I can make
you a snack.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.346
- Chloe is never gonna
get over that blanket

03:01.348 --> 03:03.515
as long as your Mom
keeps finding it for her.

03:03.517 --> 03:07.419
But Daddy knows
exactly what to do.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.556
- Leave it alone
and let Mom handle it?

03:11.192 --> 03:16.461
- Oh, thunderchild,
I have so much to teach you.

03:17.364 --> 03:21.767
- [electric guitar
playing heavy rock]

03:21.769 --> 03:24.102
- COLOSSO:
Play it, Max!

03:24.104 --> 03:25.370
Oh, I'm a hippie! Oh!

03:25.372 --> 03:28.340
This is the greatest
day of my life!

03:28.342 --> 03:30.375
- [heavy rock continues]

03:30.377 --> 03:32.578
[rock music flourish]

03:32.580 --> 03:34.646
- COLOSSO:
Woo!

03:34.648 --> 03:37.149
- Well, this is weird.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.818
- What? There's nothing
weird about this.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.787
- Take my underwear!

03:44.525 --> 03:46.792
- Okay, now it's weird.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.627
- Gideon and Sarah are
completely in love with us,

03:48.629 --> 03:50.495
and your solution
is to play video games?

03:50.497 --> 03:51.530
- This is
the closest I'll get

03:51.532 --> 03:53.632
to living out
my rock star dream--

03:53.634 --> 03:54.600
going on world tours,

03:54.602 --> 03:56.335
staying in fancy
hotel rooms,

03:56.337 --> 03:57.035
having adoring fans.

03:57.037 --> 03:59.771
- Hey, about that--can
I have my underwear back?

03:59.773 --> 04:01.773
I feel a draft.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.810
- Next time,
keep 'em on your butt.

04:04.812 --> 04:05.744
- Could you focus, Max?

04:05.746 --> 04:07.846
We have to fix our
Gideon and Sarah problem.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.181
- That's a school problem.

04:09.183 --> 04:11.250
We're home now.
We're safe.

04:11.252 --> 04:11.750
- Really?

04:11.752 --> 04:15.254
Thunder monitor,
show us the door cams.

04:16.757 --> 04:17.623
- Does she have a tent?

04:17.625 --> 04:21.326
- Yep, and he's
stringing up a hammock.

04:21.495 --> 04:22.828
We're not safe
at school,

04:22.830 --> 04:23.862
we're not safe
at home.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.297
This has to stop.
- You're right.

04:25.299 --> 04:26.832
If we let them sleep
through the night,

04:26.834 --> 04:29.434
then we attack
in the morning!

04:29.436 --> 04:31.570
- No. I have a better plan.
- Let's do it.

04:31.572 --> 04:34.339
- You haven't heard the plan.
- Let's not do it.

04:34.341 --> 04:36.341
- Okay...

04:36.343 --> 04:38.710
we're gonna set Gideon
and Sarah up with each other.

04:38.712 --> 04:41.847
If they hit it off,
they'll forget all about us.

04:41.849 --> 04:42.614
- Oh...

04:42.616 --> 04:44.383
now that is
a really good idea.

04:44.385 --> 04:48.387
Colosso, give her the deluxe,
super fan treatment.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.422
- COLOSSO:
Right!

04:53.594 --> 04:56.328
- A simple thank you
would have been fine.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.498
- ¶

04:59.500 --> 05:00.599
¶ What you see ¶

05:00.601 --> 05:01.867
¶ Is not what you get ¶

05:01.869 --> 05:05.470
¶ Livin' our lives
with a secret ¶

05:05.472 --> 05:06.938
¶ We fit right in ¶

05:06.940 --> 05:08.373
¶ Bet you never guessed ¶

05:08.375 --> 05:09.908
¶ 'Cause we're
livin' our lives ¶

05:09.910 --> 05:11.610
¶ Just like all the rest ¶

05:11.612 --> 05:13.545
¶ A picture
perfect family ¶

05:13.547 --> 05:15.447
¶ Is what we try to be ¶

05:15.449 --> 05:16.882
¶ Look closer,
you might see ¶

05:16.884 --> 05:18.483
¶ The crazy things we do ¶

05:18.485 --> 05:20.352
¶ This isn't
make believe ¶

05:20.354 --> 05:21.787
¶ It's our reality ¶

05:21.789 --> 05:22.888
¶ Just your average family ¶

05:22.890 --> 05:26.525
¶ Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble ¶

05:26.527 --> 05:30.862
¶ Livin' a double life ¶¶

05:33.767 --> 05:35.200
- ¶

05:35.202 --> 05:38.070
- All right, I texted Sarah
to meet me over at table seven.

05:38.072 --> 05:39.705
- Okay, good,
I just texted Gideon

05:39.707 --> 05:40.672
to meet me at
table seven--

05:40.674 --> 05:44.209
although, it is a school night,
so they might not show up.

05:45.546 --> 05:48.647
- Max!
It's honey time!

05:48.649 --> 05:49.548
- They live on our porch.

05:49.550 --> 05:52.150
Do you think
school would stop 'em?

05:53.620 --> 05:56.154
- I'm sorry, Sarah,
but I need this table.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.255
I'm meeting Phoebe.

05:57.257 --> 05:58.857
- Well,
I'm meeting Max.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.159
- I know what's
happening.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.595
Me and Phoebe
and you and Max

06:03.597 --> 06:05.597
are having
a double date!

06:05.599 --> 06:06.064
- See?

06:06.066 --> 06:09.868
I knew sleeping on
his porch would work!

06:10.904 --> 06:12.270
- Right, they're
sitting together.

06:12.272 --> 06:12.871
Now what?

06:12.873 --> 06:15.140
- Now we call
the Love Doctor.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.709
Brrring! Brrring!
What?

06:17.711 --> 06:19.711
I have to take this.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.314
Yes, this is Phoebe,
the Love Doctor.

06:22.316 --> 06:24.182
- No one's enjoying this.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.551
- Just watch. They're
perfect for each other.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.587
We just need to
create the right mood

06:28.589 --> 06:29.755
for them to realize it.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.823
Here, first step,
flowers.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.325
- Somebody ordered
your table

06:33.327 --> 06:37.162
the Splatty
Romance Package.

06:42.269 --> 06:43.802
- I bet Max set this up.

06:43.804 --> 06:47.606
He's so romantic,
don't you think?

06:47.608 --> 06:50.342
- All I think
about is Phoebe.

06:50.344 --> 06:52.778
Achoo!
- Ew!

06:52.780 --> 06:55.747
- Did you forget
he's allergic to everything?

06:55.749 --> 06:56.982
- Yes, I did.

06:56.984 --> 07:00.886
- Achoo! Achoo!
- SARAH: Ah!

07:00.888 --> 07:01.620
- Ring! Ring!

07:01.622 --> 07:03.622
Hello, this is
Dr. Better-Than-Phoebe,

07:03.624 --> 07:05.257
and I am ready
to operate.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.925
- [glove snaps sharply]

07:06.927 --> 07:10.162
- Didn't that sting?
- Worth it.

07:10.164 --> 07:12.631
- ¶

07:12.633 --> 07:14.065
- Okay. Now before
your Mom gets back,

07:14.067 --> 07:18.036
it's up to us to fix
Chloe's blanket problem.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.037
- Just to be clear--

07:19.039 --> 07:22.741
we're talking about
Khloe Kardashian, right?

07:24.044 --> 07:27.279
- No. Chloe,
your sister.

07:28.015 --> 07:31.683
- Not as high profile,
but I'll still help.

07:31.852 --> 07:34.152
- First, we hide
her blanket.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.121
Next, we tell her
it's missing.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.923
She'll get upset,
but...

07:37.925 --> 07:39.224
she'll get over it.

07:39.226 --> 07:43.795
- Then we'll fix this
Khloe Kardashian thing.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.265
- Sure.

07:48.735 --> 07:49.801
Chloe?

07:49.803 --> 07:52.070
- [whooshing]
Hey, Daddy.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.172
- Honey, take a seat.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.808
We've got
some bad news.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.944
Your blanket...
is gone.

07:58.946 --> 07:59.444
- What?

07:59.446 --> 08:02.714
- Your blanket's gone
and you have to deal with it!

08:04.418 --> 08:07.819
- Uh, settle down, Billy.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.087
Honey...

08:09.089 --> 08:10.121
I know you're sad,

08:10.123 --> 08:13.992
but you'll always have
it in your heart.

08:14.428 --> 08:16.261
- I thought it was
in the cupboard.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.230
- HANK:
Mmmmm!

08:18.699 --> 08:21.299
What Billy means is
you'll always keep it

08:21.301 --> 08:24.436
in the cupboard
in your heart.

08:24.771 --> 08:27.405
But it is time
to move on.

08:27.407 --> 08:29.774
- I miss my blankie.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.977
- She still looks
pretty sad.

08:31.979 --> 08:34.145
Should I yell
at her again?

08:34.147 --> 08:35.814
- No.

08:35.983 --> 08:37.315
This is all part
of the process.

08:37.317 --> 08:40.252
She'll be completely
over it in...20 minutes.

08:40.254 --> 08:42.787
- I...miss...my...

08:42.789 --> 08:44.856
blankie-e-e-e-e!

08:44.858 --> 08:46.358
- Let's get that
blanket back.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.727
- HANK:
Good idea.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.695
- Blankie!

08:51.064 --> 08:53.465
- HANK: [gasps]
It's gone!

08:53.467 --> 08:55.166
- What's gone?

08:55.168 --> 08:56.001
- Oh, ho, ho...

08:56.003 --> 09:00.171
my bad mood, now that
you've returned, sweetie.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.139
[kisses]

09:01.141 --> 09:03.742
- CHLOE: I...
miss...my...

09:03.744 --> 09:04.943
blankie-e-e-e-e!

09:04.945 --> 09:07.312
- Oh, no!
It happened again?

09:07.314 --> 09:08.079
- Yes, because we--

09:08.081 --> 09:10.282
- ¶ We don't know
where it is ¶

09:10.284 --> 09:13.952
Why don't you go look
for it upstairs?

09:14.321 --> 09:15.820
A blanket doesn't
just walk away.

09:15.822 --> 09:17.489
Somebody had to
have taken it.

09:17.491 --> 09:18.790
- It bet it was Colosso--

09:18.792 --> 09:20.458
because he's always
up to something,

09:20.460 --> 09:23.128
and he's snuggling
it over there.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.230
- It's so soft.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.799
I've been looking for
you my whole life.

09:27.801 --> 09:28.433
Oh...

09:28.435 --> 09:32.270
- Colosso, get your bunny
butt off Chloe's blanket.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.306
- Oh? This is Chloe's?

09:34.308 --> 09:37.042
Ah! That changes
nothing!

09:37.044 --> 09:38.076
[evil laughter]

09:38.078 --> 09:40.912
- Quick, Billy, run after him
and get Chloe's blanket.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.447
- BILLY:
[zooming]

09:42.449 --> 09:43.181
Just to be clear--

09:43.183 --> 09:45.250
are we talking
about Khloe Kardashian?

09:45.252 --> 09:47.519
- [silently]
No.

09:47.521 --> 09:50.055
- ¶

09:50.057 --> 09:52.257
- Fresh clams?
- Fresh from where?

09:52.259 --> 09:55.193
- You ask too
many questions.

09:56.229 --> 09:59.464
- Oh, good, the lovebird's
flying back to the nest.

10:01.435 --> 10:04.135
- The police said
it's only been 20 minutes,

10:04.137 --> 10:08.039
so, it's too soon
to declare Max missing.

10:08.508 --> 10:10.141
- Okay, I just hacked
into the tubes

10:10.143 --> 10:12.477
to send them a romantic,
heart-shaped pizza.

10:12.479 --> 10:14.245
- [tube "pops,"
pizza splats]

10:14.247 --> 10:18.016
- Did you order this pizza
shaped like a butt?

10:18.018 --> 10:21.086
- No, I...I didn't order
any of this stuff.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.021
I'm done waiting
here for Phoebe.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.289
I'm gonna go wait
at her house.

10:24.291 --> 10:27.225
- I'm gonna go get
my bloodhound, Watson.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.927
He'll track Max down.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.862
He always does.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.264
- Max, they're leaving.
Do something.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.834
- They can't leave,
if they can't find the door.

10:35.836 --> 10:36.501
[powers whooshing]

10:36.503 --> 10:38.503
- MRS. WONG: Whoa!
- [objects scattering]

10:38.505 --> 10:40.372
- PHOEBE: Max,
turn the lights back on.

10:40.374 --> 10:42.974
- My dumpster clams!

10:45.278 --> 10:46.544
I mean...

10:46.546 --> 10:48.513
ocean clams.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.449
- Phoebe, look!

10:51.451 --> 10:53.018
- You caught me.

10:53.020 --> 10:53.551
- I did.

10:53.553 --> 10:56.354
And you didn't comment
on my sweaty palms.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.123
- I like a moist hand.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.959
- I like how you smell
like pimple cream.

11:01.862 --> 11:05.597
- Hey, I've got movie
tickets for me and Max.

11:05.599 --> 11:07.399
Do you wanna go, instead?
- Sure.

11:07.401 --> 11:09.567
I've spent so much time
in Phoebe's locker,

11:09.569 --> 11:11.936
I'm happy to
go anywhere.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.274
- I think they're
going on a date.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.443
- Yep, thanks
to my plan.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.378
- Moist hands
was not your plan.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.847
- Still worked.
- Hmmm...

11:24.418 --> 11:26.418
- ¶

11:26.420 --> 11:29.020
- Hand over
the blanket, Colosso.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.089
- What are you
guys scared of--

11:31.091 --> 11:32.957
a little girl?

11:34.294 --> 11:35.060
- Yes...

11:35.062 --> 11:37.262
and little
girl's mother.

11:37.564 --> 11:40.065
- Sorry, but you know
the old saying--

11:40.067 --> 11:41.433
finders keepers,
losers...

11:41.435 --> 11:44.202
get outta my face!

11:44.204 --> 11:45.170
- Oh, yeah?

11:45.172 --> 11:47.605
Well, whoever smelt it,
dealt it.

11:47.607 --> 11:49.574
That's all I've got.

11:49.576 --> 11:51.443
- I'm taking back
that blanket.

11:51.445 --> 11:54.312
- [electrical zapping]
- HANK: [gasping]

11:54.314 --> 11:56.247
You electrified
your cage?

11:56.249 --> 11:58.483
- Colosso,
you have a problem.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.617
- You're right.

11:59.619 --> 12:01.920
Stealing a little
girl's blanket.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.354
What's wrong with me?

12:03.356 --> 12:05.623
Sorry, I'll turn
the cage off.

12:05.625 --> 12:06.391
- [switch clicks]

12:06.393 --> 12:08.460
- [electrical zapping]
- BILLY: [gasping]

12:08.462 --> 12:12.063
- This is the kind of fun
we're gonna have now, blankie.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.932
[chuckling]

12:13.934 --> 12:20.004
- ¶

12:20.006 --> 12:21.272
- STUDENTS:
[mixed comments]

12:21.274 --> 12:22.941
- Okay, we're here
ten seconds

12:22.943 --> 12:26.044
and no bees, boolloons
or bloodhounds.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.048
- Surprise!

12:31.985 --> 12:33.485
I baked you cookies.

12:33.487 --> 12:34.352
I ate some of them

12:34.354 --> 12:36.654
because I've been in
here since last night.

12:36.656 --> 12:39.624
- Oh, Gideon!
So sweet!

12:39.626 --> 12:42.026
I love locker food.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.629
- Max, I think
we did it.

12:44.631 --> 12:45.430
- We sure did.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.499
- Hey, Phoebe, I'm sorry
to break your heart,

12:47.501 --> 12:49.167
but I went out
with Sarah last night.

12:49.169 --> 12:52.237
- And, Max, in case
you were wondering,

12:52.239 --> 12:56.074
I'm the Sarah
he's talking about.

12:56.610 --> 13:01.246
- Oh, no! I...have
feelings of sadness now.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.414
- Phoebe,
you're still young.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.283
You'll meet
another stud muffin

13:05.285 --> 13:07.185
who's outta your league.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.287
- Yeah. Yeah.
I'm heartbroken.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.289
So, when are you going
on your second date?

13:11.291 --> 13:13.057
- I'm taking Gideon
to meet my uncle

13:13.059 --> 13:14.225
at his band's
concert tonight

13:14.227 --> 13:16.261
at the Hiddenville
Colosseum.

13:16.263 --> 13:19.430
- Huh, Sugar Ray's playing
the Colosseum tonight.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.666
Wait! Is your uncle
in Sugar Ray?

13:21.668 --> 13:23.101
- Yeah, Mark McGrath.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.536
He's a rock star.
No big deal.

13:24.538 --> 13:28.139
- Oh, I thought your uncle
was Mark McGrath the janitor.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.309
- I'm a custodial
engineer.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.414
- Who knows? Maybe if
you become my boyfriend,

13:36.416 --> 13:40.151
Uncle Mark will let you come
on tour with us this summer.

13:40.153 --> 13:40.752
- Wait. Wait.

13:40.754 --> 13:43.087
So, Gideon's gonna get to
live the rock star dream?

13:43.089 --> 13:45.523
- Hope so.
Come on, babe.

13:47.694 --> 13:49.494
- She's talking to you.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.662
- Oh.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.430
I'm "babe"?

13:52.432 --> 13:55.066
I'm someone's babe!

13:59.339 --> 14:02.574
- Max, we're free!
Do you hear me?!

14:02.576 --> 14:04.442
Free! Woo!

14:04.444 --> 14:06.344
[laughing]

14:06.346 --> 14:08.279
Why aren't you twirling?

14:08.281 --> 14:09.714
- I'm...twirling
on the inside.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.049
- Okay, good,
for a second there,

14:11.051 --> 14:13.351
I thought you were gonna
try to become Sarah's boyfriend

14:13.353 --> 14:15.053
so you could go on
that world tour.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.055
- What? I would
never do that.

14:17.057 --> 14:17.655
- Okay. Good.

14:17.657 --> 14:20.291
I'm gonna go enjoy
having Gideon out of my life.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.759
[squeals]

14:22.062 --> 14:25.196
- And I'm gonna go get
Sarah back into mine.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.598
Woo!
[laughs]

14:26.600 --> 14:29.734
Twirling's a lot more
fun than I thought.

14:34.908 --> 14:38.843
- ¶

14:38.845 --> 14:40.812
- S'up, Sarah?

14:40.814 --> 14:44.249
I'm, uh, ready
to be your boyfriend.

14:44.251 --> 14:45.717
[laughs]

14:45.719 --> 14:46.417
Oh, what's that?

14:46.419 --> 14:48.453
Kiss you in front of
your rock star uncle?

14:48.455 --> 14:52.223
Huh. It's a little
weird, but, okay.

14:53.526 --> 14:57.528
[smooching mirror]

14:57.530 --> 15:00.765
- What's up?
- MAX: [gasps]

15:00.767 --> 15:02.300
[self-conscious laugh]

15:02.302 --> 15:04.535
I was just cleaning
the mirror with my face.

15:04.537 --> 15:05.937
- [mirror squeaking]

15:05.939 --> 15:06.971
- Anyway, goodbye.

15:06.973 --> 15:08.706
- Hold on,
mirror kisser.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.508
[powers whooshing]

15:10.510 --> 15:13.444
That your disguise bag?
- No.

15:13.446 --> 15:16.547
- It says
"Disguise Bag."

15:16.549 --> 15:18.716
- Actually, it says...

15:18.718 --> 15:21.920
Dis...guy's...bag,

15:21.922 --> 15:25.657
'cause it belongs
to dis guy.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.327
- You're gonna sneak
into that concert

15:29.329 --> 15:30.662
and try to make Sarah
fall for you,

15:30.664 --> 15:33.631
just so her uncle will take
you on that world tour.

15:33.633 --> 15:34.332
- Okay, fine!

15:34.334 --> 15:36.935
Just 'cause I have to live
out my rock star dream--

15:36.937 --> 15:38.970
private jets,
backstage passes,

15:38.972 --> 15:40.271
all you can eat shrimp.
[laughs]

15:40.273 --> 15:42.807
You know how much
this guy loves shrimp.

15:42.809 --> 15:43.675
- Max, you cannot
mess with

15:43.677 --> 15:45.743
Gideon and Sarah's
relationship like that.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.312
- It's not even
a relationship.

15:47.314 --> 15:49.514
They went on one date
that we tricked them into.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.449
So, I'm not letting
you stand in my way

15:51.451 --> 15:53.017
of dating the girl
that I can't stand.

15:53.019 --> 15:55.520
- Well, I'm not
gonna let you leave.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.488
- MAX: [powers whooshing]
- PHOEBE: Whoa!

15:57.490 --> 15:58.990
Ow! Max! Ow!

15:58.992 --> 16:01.559
Unless you do that.

16:02.929 --> 16:06.731
- ¶

16:06.733 --> 16:07.832
- CHLOE:
[whooshing]

16:07.834 --> 16:09.734
- I know it's
been a whole day

16:09.736 --> 16:11.436
since we lost
your blanket,

16:11.438 --> 16:14.772
but please stop
teleporting things away.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.607
- CHLOE:
[whooshing]

16:16.609 --> 16:17.408
[whooshing]

16:17.410 --> 16:19.610
It's not under
the table.

16:19.612 --> 16:22.013
- BARB:
[groans]

16:23.016 --> 16:25.316
- That new blanket
looks just like Chloe's.

16:25.318 --> 16:25.950
There is no way

16:25.952 --> 16:27.719
she's gonna be able
to tell the difference.

16:27.721 --> 16:30.421
Chloe, we found
your blanket!

16:30.423 --> 16:31.089
- Blankie!

16:31.091 --> 16:32.924
- Oh, thank goodness.
Where was it?

16:32.926 --> 16:33.992
- Oh, it doesn't matter,

16:33.994 --> 16:36.627
just as long
as Chloe's happy.

16:36.629 --> 16:39.831
- [sniffing]
Do you think I'm a fool?

16:39.833 --> 16:43.334
- We were hoping
you were.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.471
- This blanket's a fake!

16:46.473 --> 16:47.105
- No, it's not.

16:47.107 --> 16:50.375
- Yeah, it looks just like
the one that we took from you.

16:50.377 --> 16:51.943
- What?
- What?

16:51.945 --> 16:53.678
- Goose!

16:53.680 --> 16:55.780
- [electrical zapping]
- [heavy thud]

16:55.782 --> 16:57.782
- Hank, start talking...

16:57.784 --> 16:59.117
- You look
beautiful today.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.418
- ...about the blanket.

17:00.420 --> 17:01.686
- Okay, I know
where it is,

17:01.688 --> 17:03.354
but you are not
gonna believe it.

17:03.356 --> 17:06.024
- Colosso has it?
- Yes, dear.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.626
- COLOSSO: Ah, you guys
are just in time

17:08.628 --> 17:10.128
to watch
my snuggle party.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.663
Snuggle. Snuggle.
Snuggle. Snuggle.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.832
- Colosso, give us
back that blanket,

17:14.834 --> 17:16.801
or I'll take it
from you, myself.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.536
- Barb, I already tried,
and if Thunder Man

17:18.538 --> 17:20.705
can't open that cage,
no one can.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.374
- [electrical zapping]
- COLOSSO: [gasping]

17:23.376 --> 17:24.108
Okay!

17:24.110 --> 17:27.912
- Well, no fair.
You have electrical powers.

17:28.915 --> 17:30.548
- Here you go, Chloe.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.083
- Blankie!

17:32.085 --> 17:33.818
[sniffing]

17:33.820 --> 17:36.054
Ah, that's the stuff.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.123
- I miss my blankie!

17:39.125 --> 17:41.125
- Calm down,
Dr. Bunny.

17:41.127 --> 17:42.160
- Never!

17:42.162 --> 17:44.028
I...miss...my...

17:44.030 --> 17:46.831
blankie-e-e-e-e!

17:46.833 --> 17:49.767
- Whoa, is that what
I sounded like?

17:49.769 --> 17:52.103
- Uh, yes, when you
weren't teleporting

17:52.105 --> 17:53.738
all our furniture to...

17:53.740 --> 17:56.908
Where is it?
- Abu Dhabi.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.913
Blankie made
me a monster.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.415
Here, you keep it.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.784
- Oh! Blankie!

18:06.786 --> 18:09.420
I missed your soft touch.

18:09.422 --> 18:13.091
- Chloe, we are
so proud of you.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.059
But we're even
more proud of...

18:15.061 --> 18:17.161
ourselves!
[laughing]

18:17.163 --> 18:18.896
None of this would
have happened,

18:18.898 --> 18:20.998
if Billy and I hadn't
stolen that blanket.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.135
- Knock it off, Hank.
- Yes, dear.

18:24.137 --> 18:28.473
- ¶

18:28.475 --> 18:29.874
- Can you believe
my uncle hooked us up

18:29.876 --> 18:32.143
with luxury box seats
to his concert?

18:32.145 --> 18:33.444
- Your uncle's so cool.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.847
My uncle lives
in our garage.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.453
- It's cool, bro.
I'm a roadie.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.088
Yeah, the band asked
me to come up here

18:44.090 --> 18:47.125
and see if I could check
out the acoustics.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.194
- [tuning fork
ringing loudly]

18:50.196 --> 18:53.498
- Oh. No,
this is not good.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.033
It could be a while.

18:57.971 --> 19:00.771
Hey, chef bro,
you seen a cute redhead?

19:00.773 --> 19:03.040
She's about this tall
and this crazy?

19:03.042 --> 19:04.809
- Yeah, if you care
about someone,

19:04.811 --> 19:07.478
you should go
kiss a mirror.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.982
- Chef bro,
you're my sis!

19:10.984 --> 19:11.849
- That's right, Max.

19:11.851 --> 19:12.884
- How'd you
beat me here?

19:12.886 --> 19:14.685
- 'Cause I didn't
waste an hour

19:14.687 --> 19:15.853
at the Wig Depot.

19:15.855 --> 19:20.024
- I also had to go to
the Sleeveless Shirt Shack.

19:21.094 --> 19:22.593
- Okay, well,
now you can go away

19:22.595 --> 19:24.962
and leave the happy
couple alone.

19:26.232 --> 19:27.064
- I'm not going anywhere

19:27.066 --> 19:30.201
until I win back
what's her face.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.170
- Well, then,
you leave me no choice.

19:32.172 --> 19:35.239
- [knife blade swooshing]

19:35.241 --> 19:36.941
- Oh!

19:38.578 --> 19:40.811
- Huh! You wanna beef?

19:40.813 --> 19:42.580
You got it.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.115
- PHOEBE:
Oh!

19:44.117 --> 19:47.752
That was a veggie
burger, you fool!

19:50.123 --> 19:51.789
Whoa!

19:52.825 --> 19:53.991
- GIDEON:
A roadie-chef fight?

19:53.993 --> 19:57.762
Is every one of my dreams
gonna come true tonight?

19:57.764 --> 20:00.698
- [rock music]
- [boot sizzling]

20:00.700 --> 20:01.966
- Ah!

20:01.968 --> 20:05.536
- [rock music continues]

20:05.538 --> 20:13.544
¶

20:13.546 --> 20:14.745
- Oh!

20:14.747 --> 20:17.848
- Nice! Chef won.

20:18.585 --> 20:19.951
- Let me go, Phoebe!

20:19.953 --> 20:21.085
- Not until you listen.

20:21.087 --> 20:24.622
- No, uh, you both
need to listen.

20:25.959 --> 20:26.857
- BOTH:
Sugar Ray?!

20:26.859 --> 20:28.726
- Well, the band's
name's Sugar Ray,

20:28.728 --> 20:30.294
but I'm Mark McGrath.

20:30.296 --> 20:31.696
- BOTH:
Oh.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.598
Mark McGrath?!

20:34.767 --> 20:36.300
- Listen, I've toured
around the world,

20:36.302 --> 20:38.936
and I've seen
a lot of things.

20:38.938 --> 20:39.937
And I see
what's going on here.

20:39.939 --> 20:45.042
You ladies are clearly
in love with my niece's date.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.111
- PHOEBE: I'm sorry,
that's definitely not it.

20:47.113 --> 20:48.813
- MAX: That's not
what's happening.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.648
- Buh! Buh! Buh!
Don't talk.

20:50.650 --> 20:51.349
Just look.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.751
- This is the best
view of the stage.

20:53.753 --> 20:54.685
- Why watch the stage,

20:54.687 --> 20:58.022
when I have a front
row seat...to your face?

20:58.024 --> 20:59.123
- Oh...

20:59.125 --> 21:02.660
you just bought
yourself a nose kiss.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.763
- MARK: Oh...
[laughs]

21:05.765 --> 21:09.066
You can't stop
that dorky passion.

21:10.003 --> 21:14.739
- Mark McGrath's right.
- Mark McGrath sure is.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.807
- MAX: They really
fell for each other.

21:16.809 --> 21:19.910
I can't stand in the way
of their nerd love.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.045
- Oh, man,
look at this place.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.980
- Yeah.
- So sorry about the mess.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.815
- Ah, don't worry
about it.

21:24.817 --> 21:27.618
It'll get cleaned up
by the other Mark McGrath.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.321
- Maybe you're
the other Mark McGrath.

21:30.323 --> 21:32.790
Did you ever
think of that?

21:35.928 --> 21:36.927
- All right,
let's get outta here

21:36.929 --> 21:38.696
before Gideon
and Sarah recognize us.

21:38.698 --> 21:41.666
- Guess it's time to kiss
my rock star dreams goodbye.

21:41.668 --> 21:44.135
- Oh, wait,
before you go...

21:44.804 --> 21:47.204
I have got
something for you.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.173
- Your guitar?

21:49.175 --> 21:50.641
- Better.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.810
- MAX:
[gasps]

21:54.013 --> 21:57.248
- Max, it's filled
with shrimp.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.251
- How did you know?

22:00.253 --> 22:02.186
- I'm Mark McGrath.

22:02.188 --> 22:04.121
It's what I do.

22:05.024 --> 22:09.160
- ¶

22:12.131 --> 22:24.375
