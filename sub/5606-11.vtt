You good?

00:31.827 --> 00:33.827
Just wondering what
we're walking into,

00:33.829 --> 00:36.095
you coming
strapped so heavy.

00:36.097 --> 00:38.897
I've never dealt
with this guy Remy before.

00:38.899 --> 00:41.032
You just make sure
we don't get ripped off.

00:41.034 --> 00:42.833
I'll make sure
we don't get got.

00:42.835 --> 00:44.801
REMY:
<i> Here I was, expecting</i>

00:44.803 --> 00:47.970
to transact with some
bona fide gangsters.

00:47.972 --> 00:49.972
Instead, you
fools roll in here

00:49.974 --> 00:51.907
asking for the friends
and family discount?

00:51.909 --> 00:53.241
Think of it as a

00:53.243 --> 00:54.976
"get to know you"
discount.

00:54.978 --> 00:57.678
If your product is as
good as you say it is,

00:57.680 --> 00:59.279
we'll be back

00:59.281 --> 01:01.848
for a whole lot
more next time.

01:01.850 --> 01:04.050
(chuckles) Open
your ears, big man.

01:04.052 --> 01:06.385
'Cause I'm about to educate you
on a little something

01:06.387 --> 01:08.987
called supply
and demand.

01:08.989 --> 01:12.156
As in people be demanding
my supply.

01:12.158 --> 01:14.758
So why do I got
to cut you one break

01:14.760 --> 01:16.993
when I got
buyers lining up

01:16.995 --> 01:18.928
to pay full price?

01:18.930 --> 01:21.263
Economies of scale, bruddah.

01:21.265 --> 01:23.865
Low margins, high volume

01:23.867 --> 01:25.766
equals more profit.

01:25.768 --> 01:28.769
Say instead of this dope here

01:28.771 --> 01:31.905
you was sitting
on some toaster ovens.

01:31.907 --> 01:35.174
Would you bust your ass
selling unit by unit?

01:35.176 --> 01:38.110
Or would you wholesale
that inventory

01:38.112 --> 01:40.245
to some established retailer,

01:40.247 --> 01:41.913
kick back,

01:41.915 --> 01:44.215
watch that cash roll in?

01:44.217 --> 01:46.083
Head that big,

01:46.085 --> 01:48.952
I should've known
you had one brain on you.

01:48.954 --> 01:51.988
So we good at 20 a key?

01:52.957 --> 01:54.356
We good.

01:54.358 --> 01:55.957
Actually, we're not.

01:57.193 --> 01:58.959
'Cause you
disrespected my boy.

01:58.961 --> 02:01.361
And I don't
do business with punks.

02:01.363 --> 02:05.063
So, what? You
just gonna walk?

02:08.334 --> 02:10.000
Nah.
We're gonna

02:10.002 --> 02:12.869
take the money and the drugs,
and then we're gonna walk.

02:12.871 --> 02:16.005
Only question is if we're gonna
smoke your ass on the way out.

02:16.007 --> 02:18.007
KAMEKONA:
All right, Levi.

02:18.009 --> 02:19.074
Be cool.

02:19.076 --> 02:20.809
I'm sure we can
work this out.

02:20.811 --> 02:24.044
No, bro.
I don't think we can.

02:26.348 --> 02:27.347
(door bangs open)

02:27.349 --> 02:28.981
HPD! Drop your weapons!

02:28.983 --> 02:30.816
Get down
on the ground now!

02:38.258 --> 02:39.790
(handcuffs clicking)

02:39.792 --> 02:42.092
CHIN: Take 'em
away, boys.

02:42.094 --> 02:44.160
(sirens wailing,
indistinct radio transmission)

02:59.309 --> 03:01.776
All right, turn around.

03:06.081 --> 03:07.413
You did good.

03:07.415 --> 03:09.515
Everything goes
as planned,

03:09.517 --> 03:11.083
you'll be out
in a couple of years.

03:19.092 --> 03:20.191
MAN:
Empty the register!

03:20.193 --> 03:21.959
Now!

03:21.961 --> 03:24.494
What's up, Levi?
What's up, bro?

03:24.496 --> 03:27.430
Been thinking about you.
Heard you got out.  Ah.

03:27.432 --> 03:30.065
Wasn't sure if you was coming by, though.
(chuckles)

03:30.067 --> 03:31.933
Ah, I had to see
this for myself.

03:31.935 --> 03:34.001
Last I heard, you were
working the fry station

03:34.003 --> 03:36.069
at Blimpie's, hair
net and all that.

03:36.071 --> 03:38.304
You're a legitimate
tycoon now.

03:38.306 --> 03:40.339
Guess the last 12 years
have been good.

03:41.542 --> 03:45.043
After everything went down,
I decided to reevaluate.

03:45.045 --> 03:47.078
Made some changes.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.413
Good.
Prison gave you perspective.

03:49.415 --> 03:52.149
What'd you end up doing,
about two years?

03:52.151 --> 03:54.151
Knocked down from a nickel.

03:54.153 --> 03:56.119
Good behavior and whatnot.

03:56.121 --> 03:59.789
Wow. And all that time,

03:59.791 --> 04:02.825
not even a phone call, after
everything we been through.

04:02.827 --> 04:04.827
Like I said,

04:04.829 --> 04:07.062
I'm a different person now.

04:07.064 --> 04:10.098
Right. I'm back now.

04:10.100 --> 04:11.933
Gonna make some moves.

04:11.935 --> 04:14.001
In fact, I'm thinking
we should probably talk.

04:14.003 --> 04:15.836
No, Levi.

04:15.838 --> 04:18.171
I don't think we should.

04:18.173 --> 04:20.173
But if you need a job,

04:20.175 --> 04:22.241
I can hook you up
with something.

04:23.310 --> 04:25.876
I strike you
as the hair net type?

04:29.114 --> 04:31.180
Exactly.

04:33.117 --> 04:36.118
I'll be seeing you.

04:36.120 --> 04:38.186
Real soon.

04:48.031 --> 04:51.399
<i> (Hawaii Five-O </i>
theme song plays)

05:20.129 --> 05:22.062
DANNY:<i> You know</i>
<i> what your problem is?</i>

05:22.064 --> 05:23.363
STEVE:
<i> What's my problem?</i>

05:23.365 --> 05:24.997
Could you just leave me alone?
Leave you alone?

05:24.999 --> 05:26.131
Give me the headphones. I'll stop.
You know me.

05:26.133 --> 05:27.699
Don't be a child.
Why would you start

05:27.700 --> 05:29.266
a movie you're not gonna
finish? It drives me crazy.

05:29.269 --> 05:31.269
Because it beats looking
at the back of a headrest

05:31.271 --> 05:32.565
for the entire... So why
don't you read a book?

05:32.591 --> 05:33.104
There's a magazine.

05:33.106 --> 05:35.306
Why don't you do the crossword
puzzle in here? Sudoku?

05:35.308 --> 05:38.475
You like Sudoku? I don't want to do
any of those things, because what they

05:38.477 --> 05:40.009
don't allow me to do
is put on those headphones

05:40.011 --> 05:41.176
and tune you out.
Oh, that's nice.

05:41.178 --> 05:42.977
That's really nice.

05:42.979 --> 05:44.545
That's a nice thing to say
to your friend, isn't it?

05:44.547 --> 05:46.751
Huh? And that's the movie
you're gonna watch?

05:46.777 --> 05:47.548
This is... Yeah.

05:47.550 --> 05:49.883
Are you sure you two don't want
to sit together?

05:49.885 --> 05:52.018
Absolutely not. Ab... No. I
don't want to sit next to him

05:52.020 --> 05:54.220
for a number of reasons,
uh, the most important being

05:54.222 --> 05:55.888
that I am very claustrophobic.

05:55.890 --> 05:57.440
Mm-hmm. He is.
Okay? I mean,

05:57.441 --> 05:58.991
I sit in between two people,
with the arms

05:58.993 --> 06:00.125
and the hands
and everything.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.526
You touch me,
I'll go completely nuts.

06:01.528 --> 06:04.095
Plus, I don't want to have
to, you know, jump over him,

06:04.097 --> 06:07.398
give him a lap dance if I got to go
use the little boys' room. (chuckles)

06:07.400 --> 06:10.567
Well, in that case, I think
I'll skip my second Chardonnay.

06:10.569 --> 06:12.902
You're not skipping anything.
If you need to use the restroom,

06:12.904 --> 06:15.437
I will gladly get up
and let you pass by.

06:15.439 --> 06:18.273
And I'm sorry
we've been so disruptive.

06:18.275 --> 06:21.209
We've been disruptive? No,<i> we</i> haven't
been disruptive. Yeah. Yeah, "we."

06:21.211 --> 06:22.944
I'm sitting here trying
to watch<i> Pitch Perfect 2,</i>

06:22.946 --> 06:24.578
and you're telling me
I ain't doing it right.

06:24.580 --> 06:26.246
Okay? You know,
you would think that having

06:26.248 --> 06:29.282
a human being sitting between us
would-would serve as a buffer

06:29.284 --> 06:31.150
for the constant criticism,
but, no, he keeps going

06:31.152 --> 06:32.651
and going and going and going.
He, uh... he gets...

06:32.653 --> 06:34.285
he gets very
irritable, very...

06:34.287 --> 06:37.154
kind of volatile when we travel together.
DANNY: Yeah.

06:37.156 --> 06:39.956
He's-he's antsy because
he's not flying the plane.

06:39.958 --> 06:41.557
Well,

06:41.559 --> 06:44.092
I can tell this is going
to be the longest

06:44.094 --> 06:45.426
45-minute flight
of my life.

06:45.428 --> 06:47.594
I'm Steve, by the way.
And the bundle of joy

06:47.596 --> 06:49.262
to your right is Danny. Hi.

06:49.264 --> 06:51.530
Alissa. Alissa.
That's a nice name.

06:51.532 --> 06:53.999
Nice to meet you, Alissa.
How you doing?

06:54.001 --> 06:58.103
So, uh... so, Alissa,
what takes you to Maui today?

06:58.105 --> 07:00.238
Just visiting some friends.
That's nice.

07:00.240 --> 07:02.106
You guys?

07:02.108 --> 07:04.641
Well, it's a funny story.
Danny and I are attending

07:04.643 --> 07:07.243
a three-day workshop to
focus on our relationship.

07:07.245 --> 07:09.178
Our work relationship. Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

07:09.180 --> 07:11.380
We are officers of the law.
Yeah, see,

07:11.382 --> 07:14.383
the state of Hawaii mandates
that we do 24 hours of therapy

07:14.385 --> 07:16.251
every working year,
and so we packed it

07:16.253 --> 07:18.519
into one weekend
and we're gonna make a, uh...

07:18.521 --> 07:20.254
a brocation out of it.

07:20.256 --> 07:22.122
Brocation?  Brocation.
You like that?

07:22.124 --> 07:23.674
That's so cute.

07:23.675 --> 07:25.225
DANNY: Don't-don't
encourage him, all right?

07:25.227 --> 07:26.693
If he and I make it
through this weekend

07:26.695 --> 07:28.661
without killing each other,
it's a win, so...

07:28.663 --> 07:32.064
Well, if the first ten minutes
of this flight

07:32.066 --> 07:33.465
are any indication,

07:33.467 --> 07:36.968
I'm not loving your chances.

07:40.673 --> 07:42.739
ADAM:
<i> It doesn't make sense.</i>

07:42.741 --> 07:44.607
Why would Gabriel cut a deal
with Shioma

07:44.609 --> 07:46.208
just to turn around
and kill him?

07:46.210 --> 07:48.210
Because it was all a power play.

07:48.212 --> 07:50.345
He was just biding his time,
earning the Yakuza's trust

07:50.347 --> 07:52.046
until he could make his move.

07:52.048 --> 07:53.180
But he wasn't
stopping there.

07:53.182 --> 07:54.614
What do you mean?

07:54.616 --> 07:56.749
He tried to take out the heads
of the Triads

07:56.751 --> 07:58.050
and the Makauakane family

07:58.052 --> 08:00.185
at the title
fight last week.

08:00.187 --> 08:01.386
Thankfully, we stopped him.

08:01.388 --> 08:04.489
Gabriel just took a big swing
and missed.

08:04.491 --> 08:07.291
He's got no one left
to align himself with.

08:07.293 --> 08:08.459
Uh-uh.

08:08.460 --> 08:09.626
What do you think
his next move is?

08:09.628 --> 08:10.693
I don't know.

08:12.196 --> 08:15.230
But right now
I'm more interested in you.

08:15.232 --> 08:17.298
How are you holding up?

08:17.300 --> 08:20.434
I'm fine, Kono.

08:20.436 --> 08:22.536
Really. I'm fine.

08:23.505 --> 08:26.304
Nothing about this is fine.

08:28.274 --> 08:30.340
Yeah, you're right.

08:36.514 --> 08:38.313
Yeah, I just keep...

08:38.315 --> 08:42.450
reminding myself what's waiting
for me on the other side.

08:51.527 --> 08:54.593
539 more days.

08:56.530 --> 08:59.397
I miss you.

09:05.237 --> 09:07.370
GROVER: <i> So, what, no Abby today?
</i> CHIN:<i> No.</i>

09:07.372 --> 09:10.272
She had to go back to San
Francisco for a few days.

09:10.274 --> 09:12.274
So what do we got?
Got a John Doe.

09:12.276 --> 09:14.442
Couple cliff divers found him
here this morning.

09:14.444 --> 09:16.577
Looks to be
a botched dump job.

09:16.579 --> 09:18.278
Maxwell.

09:18.280 --> 09:20.313
Care to bring Lieutenant
Kelly up to speed?

09:20.315 --> 09:23.582
Gladly. Our victim
was killed execution-style,

09:23.584 --> 09:25.750
courtesy of a single gunshot
to the back of the head.

09:25.752 --> 09:29.353
T.O.D. is roughly 12 hours ago.
And prior to that, he was

09:29.355 --> 09:32.422
badly beaten, as evidenced
by the numerous lacerations

09:32.424 --> 09:34.457
and contusions
on the body and face.

09:34.459 --> 09:36.125
You any closer
to getting an I.D. on him?

09:36.127 --> 09:37.693
Unfortunately not.

09:37.694 --> 09:39.260
The dermis absorbed
too much water to run prints,

09:39.263 --> 09:41.396
so I'll have to take him back
to the lab.

09:41.398 --> 09:43.398
Wait a minute, I know this guy.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.466
That's Antone
Remiel.

09:45.468 --> 09:47.434
Went by the name Remy.

09:47.436 --> 09:50.403
This guy was supplying
drugs to half the dealers

09:50.405 --> 09:52.605
on the island, including
Kamekona and his partner Levi

09:52.607 --> 09:55.274
back in the day.

09:55.276 --> 09:58.644
KAMEKONA:
Yeah, that's him all right.

09:58.646 --> 10:00.812
Levi came by last night.

10:00.814 --> 10:02.613
I thought
he might have put together

10:02.615 --> 10:04.414
that it was me
who rolled on him.

10:04.416 --> 10:06.749
Yeah, instead Remy ends up dead.

10:06.751 --> 10:09.284
I'm guessing Levi blamed him
for the sting.

10:09.286 --> 10:10.585
Makes sense.

10:10.587 --> 10:13.354
Remy set the time and location
of the buy.

10:13.356 --> 10:14.755

come to him.

And Levi,
he never cared for him much.

10:17.526 --> 10:19.459
Well, that's because once he got
out of prison,

10:19.461 --> 10:21.227
Remy turned his life around.

10:21.229 --> 10:22.595
Did you know
he was coaching basketball

10:22.597 --> 10:24.964
at a community center?

10:24.965 --> 10:27.332
He also got a girlfriend

any hard evidence linking him

you had a wingman.

18:25.148 --> 18:27.181
Well, now,
you're probably right.

18:27.183 --> 18:28.916
But that doesn't change our
objective here, so let's

18:28.918 --> 18:30.584
just take a breath
and figure this out.

18:30.586 --> 18:32.218
KONO: All right, so we
just heard from HPD.

18:32.220 --> 18:34.053
They've been piecing
together Levi's whereabouts

18:34.055 --> 18:35.521
for the past
24 hours.

18:35.523 --> 18:37.489
Multiple witnesses have
him on the opposite side

18:37.491 --> 18:39.257
of the island at T.O.D.

18:39.259 --> 18:41.259
Which alibis him out
for Remy's murder.

18:41.261 --> 18:43.828
That changes things some.

18:43.830 --> 18:45.763
Not necessarily.

18:45.765 --> 18:47.598
Think about this.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.500
Remy was totally out of the
game for a decade, right?

18:50.502 --> 18:52.802
But then, within just 48
hours of Levi's release,

18:52.804 --> 18:54.103
he suddenly
turns up dead.

18:54.105 --> 18:55.537
So if he didn't
pull the trigger,

18:55.539 --> 18:56.704
he definitely
ordered the hit.

18:56.706 --> 18:59.073
Exactly. You said yourself
that Levi's M.O.

18:59.075 --> 19:01.542
is to get other people to do
his dirty work for him.

19:01.544 --> 19:03.977
So help him put the money
together. Gain his trust.

19:03.979 --> 19:06.112
And that way, even if he never
cops to the murder,

19:06.114 --> 19:07.813
we nail him on a drug charge.

19:07.815 --> 19:10.115
Either way, he spends the rest
of his life in jail.

19:10.117 --> 19:13.284
I don't know. I've-I've been
out of the game for a long time.

19:14.954 --> 19:16.520
Kamekona, no one knows
better than you

19:16.522 --> 19:18.755
the damage that he's capable of.

19:18.757 --> 19:21.824
Let's put him away before
he can hurt anyone else.

19:27.231 --> 19:29.764
In for a penny,
in for a pound, right?

19:33.102 --> 19:35.102
STEVE:
<i> Well, um,</i>

19:35.104 --> 19:38.038
I guess what happened
was I read the, uh,

19:38.040 --> 19:40.173
course description
incorrectly

19:40.175 --> 19:43.176
and, like,
misread it. And...

19:43.178 --> 19:45.878
long story short,
Danny and I ended up, uh,

19:45.880 --> 19:49.281
registered in here with
you guys in couples therapy.

19:49.283 --> 19:51.916
Question:
Why are you still here?

19:53.085 --> 19:54.551
That's a good question.
I don't know.

19:54.553 --> 19:57.086
That's a... good
question. (chuckles)

19:57.088 --> 19:58.587
LORAINE:
While it's true

19:58.589 --> 20:01.289
this workshop is
geared toward couples,

20:01.291 --> 20:03.924
many of the principles
covered here--

20:03.926 --> 20:06.626
such as
communication,

20:06.628 --> 20:09.195
trust and teamwork--

20:09.197 --> 20:11.130
apply to all
relationships.

20:11.132 --> 20:14.199
Including working partnerships.

20:14.201 --> 20:17.202
So given that Steve and Danny
traveled all this way,

20:17.204 --> 20:19.170
I've agreed to sign off
on their therapy hours

20:19.172 --> 20:21.705
once they've
completed the course.

20:21.707 --> 20:24.007
I should also tell you
that I've spoken

20:24.009 --> 20:26.309
with Steve and Danny
about their partnership,

20:26.311 --> 20:28.811
and it is fraught

20:28.813 --> 20:31.814
with some very

20:31.816 --> 20:33.248
serious problems.

20:33.250 --> 20:35.850
So I think it
would be both cruel

20:35.852 --> 20:37.751
and irresponsible
for us to

20:37.753 --> 20:40.153
abandon them in this time

20:40.155 --> 20:41.687
of crisis.

20:41.689 --> 20:43.255
WOMAN:
Really? I don't.

20:43.257 --> 20:45.223
Because they're
not a couple.

20:45.225 --> 20:46.624
Oh. So what, Keren?

20:46.626 --> 20:47.925
They're stuck
in a relationship

20:47.927 --> 20:49.293
they can't get out of,
they fight

20:49.295 --> 20:51.328
all the time,
and they don't have sex.

20:51.330 --> 20:53.296
It sounds a lot like
our marriage to me.

20:53.298 --> 20:54.330
(laughs)

20:54.332 --> 20:56.265
LORAINE:
Okay,

20:56.267 --> 20:58.100
settle down.

20:58.102 --> 21:00.869
We have a lot of work to do,
and I don't want to waste

21:00.871 --> 21:03.037
any more time, so I'll ask
everyone to hold hands

21:03.039 --> 21:05.205
as we get
things started

21:05.207 --> 21:07.840
with some daily
affirmations.

21:07.842 --> 21:09.608
(inhales deeply)

21:09.610 --> 21:11.242
(exhales)

21:12.612 --> 21:16.246
I come from the loving
space of my heart,

21:16.248 --> 21:18.881
and I know that love

21:18.883 --> 21:21.250
opens new possibilities.

21:21.252 --> 21:23.919
I come from the
loving space...

21:23.921 --> 21:26.254
(whispers): This is great for us.
...of my heart,

21:26.256 --> 21:29.690
I hate you.  and I
know that love...

21:29.692 --> 21:32.092
CHIN:
<i> Kamekona's still working on</i>

21:32.094 --> 21:33.760
getting the details
on that drug buy.

21:33.762 --> 21:35.895
Once he gets us a time
and a location,

21:35.896 --> 21:38.029
we can set up a sting and be in
a position to make the bust.

21:38.032 --> 21:39.765
Okay, if you think
that's best.

21:39.767 --> 21:41.233
I take it you don't.

21:41.235 --> 21:42.934
That's not it.

21:42.936 --> 21:44.936
I worked with plenty CIs
in my day.

21:44.938 --> 21:46.804
Some were pretty good,
pretty solid.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.705
Couple of 'em even
helped me close a case.

21:48.707 --> 21:50.973
See, the problem is those
are the ones that are so good,

21:50.975 --> 21:53.275
you forget that the guy
you're working with isn't a cop.

21:53.277 --> 21:55.844
I hear you,
but I'm gonna tell you

21:55.846 --> 21:59.681
what John McGarrett told me the
first time I brought in a CI.

21:59.683 --> 22:02.850
He said, "Once they're yours,
they're yours for life."

22:02.852 --> 22:04.151
So I'm telling you

22:04.153 --> 22:06.153
that Kamekona's more
than just a CI to me.

22:06.155 --> 22:07.687
He's<i> 'ohana.</i>

22:07.689 --> 22:10.923
And I've also seen
what Levi is capable of.

22:10.925 --> 22:12.925
So, believe me when I tell you

22:12.926 --> 22:14.926
that no one wants to see him
put away more than Kamekona.

22:14.929 --> 22:15.994
KONO: Thanks to
our undercover op,

22:15.996 --> 22:20.031
we're now up on
Levi's burner phone.

22:20.033 --> 22:22.933
Call logs confirm that Levi was
nowhere near the crime scene

22:22.935 --> 22:25.068
at the time of Remy's
murder, but check this out.

22:25.070 --> 22:26.235
Shortly after

22:26.237 --> 22:29.037
T.O.D., Levi receives a call

22:29.039 --> 22:31.005
from a prepaid phone

22:31.007 --> 22:33.140
less than a mile from where
the body was discovered.

22:33.142 --> 22:34.307
Oh, that's the shooter.

22:34.309 --> 22:36.409
That's the guy
that Levi hired for the hit.

22:36.411 --> 22:38.043
He's calling
to tell him Remy's dead.

22:38.045 --> 22:40.078
Right, so if we can
track this guy down

22:40.080 --> 22:41.712
and get him to roll on Levi,

22:41.714 --> 22:43.146
then we can pull Kamekona
out of there

22:43.148 --> 22:45.715
before the buy even goes down.

22:45.717 --> 22:48.050
LORAINE:
Imagine the outside legs

22:48.052 --> 22:51.119
represent the two individuals
in the relationship,

22:51.121 --> 22:53.354
while the middle leg
represents your union

22:53.356 --> 22:55.823
as a couple.

22:55.824 --> 22:58.291
So long as you work together,
you are beautifully in sync!

22:58.294 --> 23:00.160
All right, next lap,
we're taking a dive.

23:00.162 --> 23:01.194
What are you talking about? Why?

23:01.196 --> 23:02.395
It's an evasive maneuver.

23:02.397 --> 23:04.029
Okay, I need to get
to my cell phone

23:04.031 --> 23:05.197
so I can text Alissa
about tonight.

23:05.198 --> 23:06.364
You're gonna be
my distraction.

23:06.366 --> 23:08.065
We're about to win this thing.
You want to fall now?

23:08.067 --> 23:09.199
Come on, let's just finish.
Hey, hey, hey.

23:09.201 --> 23:11.000
Priorities, okay?
Priorities, Danny.

23:11.002 --> 23:12.301
Just fake an injury,
go down, stay down.

23:12.303 --> 23:14.436
Hang on. It's a bad idea.
Here we go. Here we go.

23:14.438 --> 23:16.204
Hey!
Hey! Hey!

23:16.206 --> 23:17.805
Uh, yah.

23:17.807 --> 23:19.173
Ankle. Ankle.
Hey, guys,

23:19.175 --> 23:21.475
we got a man down here, man down.
Ankle.

23:21.477 --> 23:23.910
Okay. Everything's okay.

23:23.912 --> 23:25.144
I'm gonna get some ice, okay?

23:25.146 --> 23:26.945
Can you make sure
he stays on his back?

23:26.947 --> 23:29.047
Stays on his back till I get back?
Okay.

23:29.049 --> 23:31.849
(sighs)

23:45.931 --> 23:47.196
All right...

23:47.198 --> 23:49.131
All right.

23:49.133 --> 23:51.133
Oh, my God.

23:51.135 --> 23:53.068
Dude, that actually
looks kind of funky.

23:53.070 --> 23:56.237
It does? You think?
Thanks, Steven.

23:56.239 --> 23:58.372
Okay, got some ice.

24:00.142 --> 24:02.142
(groans)

24:02.144 --> 24:04.911
Okay, everyone, take note.

24:04.913 --> 24:07.747
Because that is exactly
the type of partner

24:07.749 --> 24:10.449
you want by your side
in a crisis.

24:10.451 --> 24:14.119
Note his caring,
loving and gentle touch.

24:14.121 --> 24:17.789
(waves crashing)

24:17.791 --> 24:22.893
Now, that's a sound I'll never
take for granted again.

24:23.962 --> 24:27.797
I hate to interrupt
your moment of Zen,

24:27.799 --> 24:31.100
but it's time you fill me in
on the details of the buy.

24:31.102 --> 24:34.970
Keehi Small Boat Harbor,
tomorrow morning.

24:34.972 --> 24:38.506
Okay. Now I know
the where and when.

24:38.508 --> 24:40.875
Who's the buyer?

24:40.877 --> 24:43.544
Guy I hooked up with
while I was on the inside.

24:43.546 --> 24:45.879
Nobody you would know.

24:45.881 --> 24:48.331
That's reassuring.

24:48.332 --> 24:50.782
Look, I would tell you
that you can trust the dude,

24:50.785 --> 24:53.786
but really, I shouldn't have to,

24:53.788 --> 24:56.321
because you should trust me.

24:58.291 --> 25:00.124
I do, Levi.

25:00.126 --> 25:01.925
Good.

25:03.128 --> 25:05.194
And know this.

25:05.196 --> 25:07.062
I won't make
the same mistake twice,

25:07.064 --> 25:08.897
dealing with rats like Remy.

25:08.899 --> 25:11.165
In the end,

25:11.167 --> 25:14.168
the only people you can count on

25:14.170 --> 25:16.403
are your family.

25:19.141 --> 25:21.374
Kanoa, what's going on?

25:21.376 --> 25:23.142
They're tearing the place apart.

25:23.144 --> 25:24.209
Check it out, big bruddah.

25:24.211 --> 25:26.277
(indistinct chatter)

25:30.416 --> 25:32.849
Kamekona Tupuloa.

25:32.851 --> 25:34.517
I'm Detective Chin Ho Kelly.

25:34.519 --> 25:35.918
What you doing here?

25:35.920 --> 25:37.586
Colby Jefferson.

25:37.588 --> 25:38.920
I don't know him.

25:38.922 --> 25:41.022
Oh, really? I think you do.

25:41.024 --> 25:43.357
You see, we already know
that he's dealing drugs

25:43.359 --> 25:45.926
for you and your partner,
Levi Sosa.

25:45.928 --> 25:48.395
Now no one's seen the kid
in over two weeks.

25:48.397 --> 25:50.530
Look, I'm sorry, but I don't
know nothing about that.

25:50.532 --> 25:52.932
And if you could prove
I was dealing drugs,

25:52.934 --> 25:54.566
I'd be locked up right now,

25:54.568 --> 25:57.869
instead of asking you to get
the hell out of my mom's house.

25:57.871 --> 26:00.204
You seem like a smart guy,
Kamekona,

26:00.206 --> 26:02.039
which means you probably
already figured out

26:02.041 --> 26:04.141
that Levi Sosa is
a very dangerous man.

26:04.143 --> 26:06.276
And guys in your
line of work--

26:06.278 --> 26:08.611
they only end up
in two places.

26:08.613 --> 26:11.213
Prison or dead.

26:11.215 --> 26:14.382
So I'm asking you to look
at this like an opportunity.

26:14.384 --> 26:16.917
An opportunity to give Levi up

26:16.919 --> 26:19.052
before he drags you
down with him.

26:19.054 --> 26:21.621
Levi is<i> 'ohana.</i>

26:21.623 --> 26:23.589
I don't roll on family!

26:23.591 --> 26:27.192
All right, we'll do this
the hard way.

26:27.194 --> 26:29.194
Keep on searching!

26:29.196 --> 26:31.262
Tear the place apart
if you have to.

26:43.442 --> 26:45.341
Okay, so, the suspect's
phone came online

26:45.343 --> 26:47.142
less than 20
minutes ago.

26:47.144 --> 26:49.344
It pinged to that
rental house over there.

26:49.346 --> 26:51.212
According to the owner, the
place was prepaid in cash.

26:51.214 --> 26:52.479
It's got to be
Remy's shooter.

26:52.481 --> 26:55.415
We need to move now.

27:00.888 --> 27:02.554
(gunshots)

27:04.391 --> 27:07.625
OFFICER: Man down! I got a man down!
GROVER: Take cover!

27:09.562 --> 27:10.661
GROVER:
Go! Go! Go!

27:16.568 --> 27:18.200
GROVER:
Clear.

27:18.202 --> 27:19.668

27:19.670 --> 27:22.037

27:56.169 --> 27:58.335
(object clattering onto floor)

28:00.305 --> 28:03.039
Oops.

28:03.041 --> 28:05.041
You're a former Navy SEAL.

28:05.043 --> 28:06.709
What happened to stealth mode?
(whispering): I'm sorry.

28:06.711 --> 28:08.043
You awake?

28:08.045 --> 28:09.310
You don't have
to whisper now.

28:09.312 --> 28:10.544
No, I'm not awake.
I'm asleep, you putz.

28:10.546 --> 28:12.145
Did you see the
photos I sent you?

28:12.147 --> 28:13.713
Yeah, I-I saw the photos you sent me.
We had fun.

28:13.715 --> 28:16.148
Yeah, you look... guys look like
you're having a great time.

28:16.150 --> 28:18.016
The girls were really bummed
you didn't make it.

28:18.018 --> 28:19.617
Yeah.
I didn't know what to tell 'em.

28:19.619 --> 28:20.985
You could have
told them

28:20.987 --> 28:22.252
you destroyed
my entire weekend.

28:22.254 --> 28:24.187
I hope you know that.
I hope you're happy.

28:24.189 --> 28:26.088
You know what? It's the
second time this month

28:26.090 --> 28:27.389
that ankle's
given out on you.

28:27.391 --> 28:29.324
It's not the ankle,
the ankle, the ankle, Danny.

28:29.326 --> 28:32.193
We both know this trip never had
a chance from the start.

28:32.195 --> 28:36.030
Oh, yeah, what was that supposed
to mean? I'm just curious. Huh?

28:36.032 --> 28:37.965
What do I mean by that?
I'm talking about your attitude.

28:37.967 --> 28:39.750
I'm talking
about this black hole

28:39.751 --> 28:41.534
of negative energy that is
Detective Danny Williams, man.

28:41.537 --> 28:43.236
I just brought us out here

28:43.238 --> 28:45.371
to try to have some fun,
reconnect a little bit,

28:45.373 --> 28:46.672
get away from work for a minute,

28:46.674 --> 28:48.106
and-and you're just...
you're just...

28:48.108 --> 28:49.574
You've been down on this thing
from the start.

28:49.576 --> 28:53.077
Well, for good reason,
apparently, it turns out, right?

28:53.079 --> 28:55.079
(sighs)

28:55.081 --> 28:58.115
You ever hear of the power
of positive thinking, Danny?

28:58.117 --> 28:59.983
Yeah, well, it works
the other way, too.

28:59.985 --> 29:01.384
It's the power
of negative thinking.

29:01.386 --> 29:04.186
Bad things happen
to negative people.

29:04.188 --> 29:06.755
See example 1A-- you.

29:06.757 --> 29:09.691
How is...?
You basically crippled me

29:09.693 --> 29:11.693
going after this girl.

29:11.695 --> 29:13.294
And somehow it's my fault?

29:14.263 --> 29:16.329
Loraine said we're not allowed
to go to bed

29:16.331 --> 29:17.630
unless we resolve our arguments,
all right?

29:17.632 --> 29:19.698
So, fine.

29:20.667 --> 29:22.667
I'm sorry, okay?

29:22.669 --> 29:24.635
Okay.

29:24.637 --> 29:29.338
Okay, good, 'cause my head
has a date with this medium...

29:29.340 --> 29:32.341
medium-firm goose down.

29:38.148 --> 29:40.081
Let me ask you
a serious question.

29:40.083 --> 29:42.483
You really think
I'm that negative?

29:43.452 --> 29:44.784
Steve?

29:44.786 --> 29:46.652
(quiet snoring)

29:46.654 --> 29:48.320
Steven?

29:48.322 --> 29:49.554
(loud snoring)

29:59.165 --> 30:01.231
(phone chimes)

30:07.305 --> 30:10.239
(tires squealing)

30:10.241 --> 30:13.342
(horn honking,
tires squealing)

30:13.344 --> 30:14.676
(horns honking)
What are you doing?

30:14.678 --> 30:16.544
Making sure we're
not being tailed.

30:16.546 --> 30:17.711
(horn honks)

30:17.713 --> 30:19.379
Hey, guys.

30:19.381 --> 30:21.681
They just stopped
in the middle of the highway.

30:21.683 --> 30:24.817
Well, if we stop, we're gonna
blow Kamekona's cover.

30:24.819 --> 30:27.219
We don't stop.
Kona, we don't stop.

30:27.221 --> 30:28.286
Just blow right past 'em.

30:28.288 --> 30:29.654
KONO:
You got it.

30:35.427 --> 30:38.060
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

30:38.829 --> 30:41.095
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

30:43.132 --> 30:45.732
(engine revving)

30:45.734 --> 30:47.433
Change of plans.

30:47.435 --> 30:49.401
Seller wants us
to go to him.

30:49.403 --> 30:51.202
You trust me, right?

30:54.207 --> 30:55.739
Of course.

30:55.741 --> 30:57.741
Good.

30:57.743 --> 30:59.709
Where is he?
Where's my brother?

30:59.711 --> 31:01.744
We haven't booked him yet,
but that will happen,

31:01.746 --> 31:03.512
unless you can talk
some sense into him.

31:08.218 --> 31:10.784
How long has Levi
had you running for him?

31:12.754 --> 31:14.787
Kanoa, listen to me.

31:14.789 --> 31:18.490
You got pinched with
two bricks of H.

31:18.492 --> 31:20.492
That's 20 years
mandatory.

31:20.494 --> 31:23.527
And there's only
one way out of it.

31:25.497 --> 31:28.631
Go ahead. Say it.

31:28.633 --> 31:30.766
You got to give up Levi.

31:32.336 --> 31:35.470
Tell them
he put you up to this.

31:35.472 --> 31:37.472
No.

31:37.474 --> 31:39.807
I'm no snitch.

31:39.809 --> 31:42.142
(buzzer sounds)

31:42.144 --> 31:43.810
KAMEKONA:
<i> You want Levi,</i>

31:43.812 --> 31:45.511
you got him.

31:45.513 --> 31:48.113
But my brother--

31:48.115 --> 31:50.381
he don't get charged.

31:59.425 --> 32:02.426
KEREN: I just want to feel
like I'm a priority to him.

32:02.428 --> 32:04.311
Even when we're making love,

32:04.312 --> 32:06.195
I feel like he's
not really present.

32:06.198 --> 32:09.165
Maybe that's because I have
to schedule an appointment

32:09.167 --> 32:10.699
with you to be there.

32:10.701 --> 32:13.368
I'm sorry I'm so busy
juggling a job

32:13.370 --> 32:14.736
and raising
your two children.

32:14.738 --> 32:19.507
Maybe if you valued that,
I'd give it up more often.

32:19.509 --> 32:21.742
Danny, you haven't exactly
been participating.

32:21.744 --> 32:24.411
What's your take on all this?

32:24.413 --> 32:28.548
Uh, my take on, uh, this
is, um-- sorry-- it's stupid,

32:28.550 --> 32:32.385
and I'd like to just
go take a nap if that's okay.

32:32.387 --> 32:36.722
So you don't see the value
in anything we do here?

32:36.724 --> 32:38.857
I-I don't. Personally,
I don't, and I'll...

32:38.859 --> 32:40.592
I'll tell... I'll
tell you why. Um,

32:40.594 --> 32:43.294
my-my folks-- they've been
married for 40 years.

32:43.296 --> 32:45.829
And, uh, they fought a bunch,

32:45.831 --> 32:47.931
but they never went through
anything like this, so...

32:47.933 --> 32:50.900
Danny, this isn't
about your parents.

32:50.902 --> 32:53.769
This is about you and Steve.

32:53.771 --> 32:55.570
This is not about
me. This is...

32:55.572 --> 32:57.705
Let me... let me... let me
just say something, okay?

32:57.707 --> 32:59.406
Just me. My opinion.

32:59.408 --> 33:01.508
I don't know
when it became

33:01.510 --> 33:03.776
so important
to overanalyze everything

33:03.778 --> 33:06.311
in our lives,
to talk about everything

33:06.313 --> 33:09.480
in our relationships, okay?
You guys love each other.

33:09.482 --> 33:12.583
That's enough. To me.
All right? You know?

33:12.585 --> 33:14.451
You are there for her,
she is there for you.

33:14.453 --> 33:16.386
That-that's commitment, right?

33:16.388 --> 33:19.322
But this, this,
everybody's poking at everybody.

33:19.324 --> 33:21.324
Poke, poke, poke.
It's like an open wound.

33:21.326 --> 33:23.326
You know? And eventually what
you're gonna do is you're gonna

33:23.328 --> 33:25.594
say something that you
cannot take back. All right?

33:25.596 --> 33:26.895
You're just... You're chipping
away at all the good.

33:26.897 --> 33:28.563
And at the end of the day,
there's gonna be

33:28.565 --> 33:29.714
nothing left but the bad.

33:29.715 --> 33:30.864
And then let me tell you
what happens.

33:30.867 --> 33:33.334
You are sitting alone
in a one-bedroom apartment

33:33.336 --> 33:34.635
putting a futon together
for your daughter

33:34.637 --> 33:35.969
coming over
every Wednesday night.

33:35.971 --> 33:38.438
You got pizza on speed dial.
Bad pizza.

33:38.440 --> 33:40.773
Okay? And that's not a place
that you want to be.

33:40.775 --> 33:42.908
Please. Trust me.

33:43.877 --> 33:45.576
(sighs)

33:50.649 --> 33:52.281
STEVE: Well, guys, I, uh...

33:52.283 --> 33:54.549
I really feel like we made
some progress here this morning.

33:54.551 --> 33:56.484
That was
really good.

33:56.486 --> 33:58.552
Really good stuff.

34:00.355 --> 34:01.987
(engine revving) GROVER:
<i> Hey, come on, Kono.</i>

34:01.989 --> 34:03.788
We need to close
some distance here.

34:03.790 --> 34:05.489
We're falling
way too far behind.

34:05.491 --> 34:07.724
Hey, I'm pushing this thing
as fast as I can.

34:07.726 --> 34:11.293
Hold on. They're
pulling in somewhere.

34:13.297 --> 34:15.530
1360 Kalaheo Avenue.

34:15.532 --> 34:16.664
It's a hotel.

34:16.666 --> 34:18.666
I don't like this.

34:18.668 --> 34:22.670
Why the hell is Levi calling an
audible this late in the game?

34:28.510 --> 34:31.711
Kanoa?
Hello, brother.

34:41.288 --> 34:43.454
Kanoa, what is this?

34:43.456 --> 34:45.389
This?

34:45.391 --> 34:47.791
This is just business.

34:47.793 --> 34:51.961
See, while you were
slinging shave ice,

34:51.963 --> 34:55.397
me and little bro here launched
an enterprise of our own.

34:55.399 --> 34:59.501
I hooked him up
with a connect out in Cali.

34:59.503 --> 35:00.902
Got him working the
distribution lines

35:00.904 --> 35:02.370
so there'd be
product to move

35:02.372 --> 35:04.905
when I was
released.

35:04.907 --> 35:07.707
He returned the favor

35:07.709 --> 35:12.377
by letting me know that
it was you who snitched me out.

35:12.379 --> 35:14.846
So if you knew it was me,

35:14.848 --> 35:16.881
why take out Remy?

35:16.883 --> 35:19.516
Because, way back when,
that punk

35:19.518 --> 35:21.518
disrespected us.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.520
I couldn't
let it slide.

35:23.522 --> 35:24.621
Before
you put me

35:24.623 --> 35:26.289
out to pasture,

35:26.291 --> 35:27.757
you figured you'd squeeze me

35:27.759 --> 35:29.625
for whatever you could.

35:29.627 --> 35:32.928
Use me to put together
some quick cash.

35:32.930 --> 35:36.831
You always were the smartest man
in the room.

35:36.833 --> 35:40.601
But you're wrong
about one thing.

35:40.603 --> 35:42.936
I'm not gonna kill you.

35:45.707 --> 35:47.773
He is.
(gun cocks)

35:53.446 --> 35:57.014
You still don't see him
for who he is, do you?

35:58.350 --> 36:01.851
He had you running drugs
when you were a kid.

36:01.853 --> 36:05.955
Had you do Remy for him
so he didn't have to.

36:10.394 --> 36:12.494
And now...

36:12.496 --> 36:15.663
you're gonna kill
your own blood for him?

36:16.699 --> 36:19.700
You've been dead to me
for a long time.

36:20.669 --> 36:23.002
May as well
make it official.

36:27.375 --> 36:30.109
If that's how it's gonna end,

36:30.111 --> 36:33.712
go ahead.

36:33.714 --> 36:36.081
I still love you, baby brother.

36:47.660 --> 36:49.726
That's really touching.

36:50.895 --> 36:52.361
(gunshot)

36:53.130 --> 36:55.930
Five-O!
Get down on the ground now!

36:57.133 --> 36:59.399
Put your weapon down.

37:02.937 --> 37:04.503
CHIN: Give me
your hands, Kanoa.

37:05.138 --> 37:07.905
KONO:
He's dead.

37:07.907 --> 37:09.973
KAMEKONA'S MOTHER:
<i> Kamekona,</i>

37:09.975 --> 37:11.541
you can't be late
for school again.

37:11.543 --> 37:15.711
I know, I know. But baby
brother needs his breakfast.

37:16.947 --> 37:18.947
Hey. Hey.

37:18.949 --> 37:21.649
I love you,
Kanoa.

37:23.552 --> 37:25.618

37:31.158 --> 37:33.057

37:35.127 --> 37:37.627
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

37:41.132 --> 37:43.665
P.A. agreed to the deal.

37:43.667 --> 37:46.667
You keep your nose clean,
you'll be out in two years.

37:49.772 --> 37:51.605
Look, Kamekona,

37:51.607 --> 37:55.408
second chances for guys like you
are pretty rare.

37:55.410 --> 37:58.611
So the question is, what
are you gonna do with yours?

37:59.747 --> 38:01.546
Now, personally,
I'm inclined to believe

38:01.548 --> 38:03.981
that if you just
put your head to it,

38:03.983 --> 38:06.116
there's nothing you can't do.

38:16.728 --> 38:18.194
(door buzzes, opens)

38:18.196 --> 38:20.596
Shave ice.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.832
What about it?

38:23.834 --> 38:26.668
Big margins.

38:26.670 --> 38:29.704
Water's free,
flavoring's cheap.

38:30.973 --> 38:34.708
You start a shave ice company,
I'll be your first customer.

38:43.718 --> 38:45.117
(door shuts)

38:47.888 --> 38:49.487
(Hawaiian folk music playing)

38:53.759 --> 38:55.492
What's up, good-lookin'?

38:55.494 --> 38:57.627
WAITER: Can I get you something?
Hey, buddy. Can I, uh...

38:57.629 --> 39:00.229
I'll just have what he's having. And a big
glass of water. Sure thing. Coming up.

39:00.231 --> 39:02.731
Lots of water. Keep it coming.
You got it.

39:02.733 --> 39:04.199
(grunts)
Hey.

39:04.201 --> 39:06.534
Thought you were
gonna see Alissa.

39:06.536 --> 39:09.203
Uh, yeah, I was. But I, uh...
You know, I blew it off

39:09.205 --> 39:12.172
to, uh... to come
and hang with you instead.

39:12.174 --> 39:14.707
You didn't have to
do that. I'm fine.

39:14.709 --> 39:16.742
Well, I didn't do it for you.

39:16.744 --> 39:18.009
No, look, you see
all these people,

39:18.011 --> 39:19.543
all these nice people
sitting around?

39:19.545 --> 39:20.911
You know how much money
they spent

39:20.913 --> 39:23.013
to have this dream
vacation experience?

39:23.015 --> 39:25.682
I personally don't think
it's fair that their experience

39:25.684 --> 39:28.084
be marred by the sight of
a gimpy-ankled man sitting here

39:28.086 --> 39:30.252
eating a $20 hamburger
by himself. It's just not right.

39:30.254 --> 39:32.654
So, you know, for their sake,
enjoy my company.

39:32.656 --> 39:34.822
See, I thought
you were just concerned for me.

39:34.824 --> 39:36.657
Nope.

39:40.596 --> 39:43.530
Want to hear
something crazy?

39:43.532 --> 39:46.733
I don't know how
crazy it is, but...

39:46.735 --> 39:48.701
when Rachel and I started
having our problems,

39:48.703 --> 39:53.571
she... suggested that we go see
a marriage counselor together.

39:53.573 --> 39:56.206
I, of course, said no.
I figured,

39:56.208 --> 39:59.108
"Look, we got problems,
we'll figure it out ourselves."

39:59.110 --> 40:02.744
But, uh, we never did that,
did we?

40:02.746 --> 40:05.546
Well, you think therapy
would've saved your marriage?

40:05.548 --> 40:06.680
No.

40:06.682 --> 40:08.682
Probably not.

40:08.684 --> 40:11.551
You know,
we had a lot of problems.

40:11.553 --> 40:13.686
Some hers, some mine. But...

40:13.688 --> 40:15.688
the point is,
is that she, um...

40:15.690 --> 40:17.289
she was willing to do
whatever it took

40:17.291 --> 40:20.225
to save our family,
and I guess...

40:20.227 --> 40:22.694
I guess maybe I wasn't.
And that...

40:22.696 --> 40:24.729
kind of sticks with me,
you know?

40:24.731 --> 40:27.531
You left everything
and moved to Hawaii

40:27.533 --> 40:29.866
so that Gracie would have
a father in her life.

40:29.868 --> 40:31.868
And still you question
your commitment to your family.

40:31.870 --> 40:34.837
Don't do it. No one can question
your commitment to your family.

40:34.839 --> 40:37.739
I know. I just... You know, it's
hard not to think about the fact

40:37.741 --> 40:39.240
that things maybe
could've been different

40:39.242 --> 40:42.042
had I gone to see that counselor
with her. I don't know.

40:42.044 --> 40:43.643
Things would've been different,
maybe you would

40:43.645 --> 40:44.844
never have met me--
how about that?

40:44.846 --> 40:47.112
One can dream.
Yeah, well,

40:47.114 --> 40:49.814
I got to tell you, man.
Your ankle aside,

40:49.816 --> 40:51.816
look around you right now,
I mean, there are...

40:51.818 --> 40:54.819
there are much worse places a
failed marriage could land you.

40:54.821 --> 40:57.721
You got to admit it. Look at this place.
Yeah. No.

40:57.723 --> 41:02.659
I agree. My failed marriage
brings me to Hawaii, and...

41:02.661 --> 41:04.127
(chuckling): my dysfunctional
relationship with you

41:04.129 --> 41:05.862
brings me here.

41:05.864 --> 41:08.030
We even screwed this up. Yeah,
we didn't get that right, either.

41:08.032 --> 41:10.416
Didn't get this right. Where's my burger?
I'm starving, man.

41:10.417 --> 41:11.875
Here, have half of this.
I'll eat your other half.

41:11.901 --> 41:13.201
I feel my stomach eating itself.

41:13.203 --> 41:15.870
Have that one.
All right, thanks, pal.

41:20.943 --> 41:23.009
It's good, huh?

41:24.212 --> 41:26.679
This is the best hamburger
I ever had in my life.

41:26.681 --> 41:28.280
Worth the 25 bucks.

41:28.282 --> 41:29.814
It's unbelievable.

41:29.816 --> 41:31.615
This place
really has everything.

41:32.584 --> 41:34.216
I used that artisanal soap.

41:34.218 --> 41:36.218
Forget about it. Unbelievable.
Unb... What'd I tell you?

41:36.220 --> 41:38.820
My hands have never been
so soft, not in my entire life.

41:38.822 --> 41:40.822
Can I feel?
Yeah, feel this.

41:40.824 --> 41:44.091
Huh? Crazy, right? Right? Feel.
Oh, that is nice. So...

41:44.093 --> 41:45.959
Really g-give it a rub.
That is so soft.

41:45.961 --> 41:48.628
Feel up in here, too. Everything.
You washed your arms? Like that?

41:48.630 --> 41:49.954
That's like the... like...
That's a doctor.

41:49.980 --> 41:50.930
You're like a surgeon.

41:50.932 --> 41:52.865
Like, the fur is now like, um...
It's like down.

41:52.867 --> 41:55.267
It's like down fur. It's like...
it's like the pillows!
