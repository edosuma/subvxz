WEBVTT

00:03.702 --> 00:06.745
Right, listen in. Please.

00:06.829 --> 00:10.874
Um, as you know,
I'm not one for making
long motivational speeches,

00:10.958 --> 00:13.501
but today's gonna be
an exception.

00:13.584 --> 00:16.462
This house has always been
our greatest asset,

00:16.546 --> 00:19.089
and now it's gonna
have to act like one,

00:19.172 --> 00:24.385
which is why I want
our guests to feel like
this is their home from home.

00:24.468 --> 00:26.303
Okay? Any questions?

00:26.387 --> 00:28.014
DONALD: Just one.

00:29.056 --> 00:30.557
Uncle Donald.

00:34.310 --> 00:39.606
Rob Roy, Robert the Bruce,
Archie Gemmill.

00:40.816 --> 00:43.818
Three men with
one thing in common,

00:43.901 --> 00:45.653
a sense of pride.

00:45.737 --> 00:48.322
When things were hard,
did they falter?

00:48.405 --> 00:49.906
No.

00:49.990 --> 00:54.577
Did they decide to
turn their homes
into boarding houses?

00:55.161 --> 00:57.079
No.

00:57.163 --> 00:59.832
And I think we should
follow their example.

01:00.540 --> 01:02.417
Oh, Molly!

01:02.500 --> 01:05.628
Surely you can't agree
with this abomination!

01:05.712 --> 01:06.879
Our home is at stake.

01:06.962 --> 01:09.089
I think Paul deserves
our full cooperation.

01:09.173 --> 01:10.174
Thank you, Molly.

01:13.217 --> 01:15.928
Then I walk alone.

01:16.012 --> 01:18.805
Our guests are gonna
expect the best.

01:18.889 --> 01:20.766
I want us to give it to them.

01:20.849 --> 01:22.809
-(HORN HONKING)
-Right, we're on.

01:29.106 --> 01:32.150
Mr Zinchenko,
welcome to Glenbogle.

01:32.233 --> 01:35.528
It's smaller than I imagined.
Much smaller.

01:35.612 --> 01:39.197
Mrs Zinchenko, Paul MacDonald.
And my family.

01:39.281 --> 01:41.949
We're all here to
make your stay
as comfortable as possible.

01:42.032 --> 01:43.493
Well, from what
you've told me,

01:43.576 --> 01:46.913
I would say that your future
depended on it, wouldn't you?

01:46.996 --> 01:50.499
I hope you don't mind.
Viktor absolutely insisted
on bringing Yuri.

01:50.582 --> 01:53.543
-Hmm.
-Yuri's very welcome, too.

01:53.627 --> 01:55.127
(GROWLING)

02:00.006 --> 02:01.007
(CHUCKLING)

02:39.706 --> 02:42.417
Oh, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty!

02:42.500 --> 02:45.003
-(GROWLING)
-Maybe he only speaks Russian.

02:45.086 --> 02:47.004
Did you know about all this?

02:47.088 --> 02:48.714
Well, I knew he was eccentric.

02:49.756 --> 02:51.008
Well, here's the deal, Molly.

02:51.091 --> 02:53.843
Viktor owns spa hotels
all over the world.

02:53.926 --> 02:56.304
If we prove to him that
Glenbogle has what it takes

02:56.386 --> 02:59.598
to offer luxury weekends,
he's willing to consider
a partnership.

02:59.682 --> 03:02.892
Paul needs today to be right.
No slip-ups.

03:03.643 --> 03:05.395
(SOFTLY) No slip-ups.

03:05.478 --> 03:07.313
-Oh, go on then.
-You hear?

03:07.396 --> 03:08.772
It's going to be a good day.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.733
Dad, do I have to chase
you out of the door?

03:10.816 --> 03:13.151
I'm going, I'm going,
I'm going, I'm going!

03:13.943 --> 03:15.903
Right. Jacket.

03:19.072 --> 03:20.949
(GROANING)

03:21.033 --> 03:22.576
You were saying
something about slip-ups?

03:24.327 --> 03:25.786
(GROANING)

03:27.705 --> 03:28.705
Dad?

03:37.129 --> 03:39.548
PAUL: No matter how
many times you look at it,

03:39.632 --> 03:42.050
it always takes
your breath away.

03:42.133 --> 03:44.469
VIKTOR: 86.2%.

03:45.928 --> 03:47.639
I'm sorry?

03:47.722 --> 03:50.057
The number of new
hospitality businesses

03:50.140 --> 03:53.976
that fail in the first year
is 86.2%.

03:55.227 --> 03:56.937
Think you can beat those odds?

03:57.772 --> 03:59.190
Well, I hope so.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.732
(CHUCKLES)

04:00.815 --> 04:05.362
I don't invest my money
in hope, Mr MacDonald.

04:06.820 --> 04:08.906
So, show us to our rooms.

04:09.782 --> 04:11.325
Certainly. Follow me.

04:19.122 --> 04:23.085
There. There's definitely
no sign of a disc problem.

04:23.168 --> 04:26.836
Looks like a simple case
of acute muscular spasm.

04:26.921 --> 04:28.255
It's easy for you to say.

04:28.338 --> 04:31.466
Ah, laughing
through the tears!

04:31.549 --> 04:33.510
Take two of these,
three times a day.

04:33.593 --> 04:36.053
As much gentle movement
as you can.

04:36.136 --> 04:39.765
Gentle, mind you,
we can't fight Mother Nature,

04:39.848 --> 04:42.392
however much
some of us might like to.

04:43.810 --> 04:46.562
Right. Goodbye, Cameron.

04:48.188 --> 04:52.150
Wee engineers of chaos,
that's what I always say.

04:52.234 --> 04:55.611
Expensive to run,
notoriously unreliable

04:55.695 --> 04:58.864
and never a word of thanks
at the end of it all.

04:58.948 --> 05:00.824
-Goodbye.
-Thanks, Doctor.

05:01.449 --> 05:02.534
(GRUNTING)

05:02.616 --> 05:03.659
Where do you think
you're going?

05:03.743 --> 05:05.620
-Work.
-Dad!

05:05.703 --> 05:07.538
You told me that
this weekend is important.

05:07.621 --> 05:10.291
Paul needs a stalker,
not a liability.

05:10.374 --> 05:11.708
There we go.

05:11.791 --> 05:14.168
All yours.

05:14.252 --> 05:15.878
I think they call it
quality time.

05:15.962 --> 05:17.380
(ENGINE STARTING OUTSIDE)

05:18.714 --> 05:20.007
Who are you phoning?

05:20.090 --> 05:21.925
Someone who would
like to help.

05:24.927 --> 05:28.055
You just sit there, all right?
I can manage.

05:28.139 --> 05:29.848
You're still upset with me,
aren't you?

05:29.931 --> 05:31.600
I just have this thing
about honesty.

05:31.683 --> 05:34.894
When I said I was 18,
it was for Paul's benefit.

05:34.978 --> 05:37.605
After that, things got
a little out of hand.

05:37.688 --> 05:39.732
That's one way
of looking at it.

05:39.815 --> 05:41.483
So is Zoe talking to you yet?

05:41.567 --> 05:43.318
We don't got a lot
of time for talking.

05:43.401 --> 05:45.069
Too busy with grown-up stuff.

05:45.153 --> 05:47.530
Not that I'd expect
a 16-year-old kid
to understand that.

05:47.614 --> 05:51.742
Funny, because last this kid
heard, she was giving you
the silent treatment.

05:51.825 --> 05:55.036
Or is totally ignoring you
the adult way of
showing affection?

05:57.288 --> 06:00.457
You've been smoking?
They're your lungs!

06:00.540 --> 06:01.958
Hey, did you get
all the shopping?

06:02.041 --> 06:03.793
Enough to start a rabbit farm.

06:03.877 --> 06:07.671
Yeah, well, this weekend
is all about keeping
Viktor sweet,

06:07.755 --> 06:09.965
and it never pays to upset
the missus now, does it?

06:10.049 --> 06:11.883
Just what we were saying.

06:13.426 --> 06:15.803
You know, I'm really
looking forward to this.

06:15.887 --> 06:17.679
I mean, the whole household
pulling together.

06:17.763 --> 06:19.640
Everyone with a specific role.

06:19.723 --> 06:23.602
I mean, I'm the cook,
Donald's the local colour,
you're the...

06:23.684 --> 06:28.314
Remind me,
what is it you do exactly,
now that school's out forever?

06:28.397 --> 06:30.857
Yeah, we can't have you
hanging around looking untidy.

06:30.941 --> 06:32.150
Any ideas?

06:33.109 --> 06:34.110
(EXHALES)

06:35.403 --> 06:36.862
There's always housemaid.

06:36.946 --> 06:39.156
Housemaid?
You can't be serious.

06:39.239 --> 06:41.575
Yeah, a bit of hard work
never hurt anyone.

06:41.658 --> 06:44.619
And since we're still
undecided about school...

06:44.702 --> 06:46.037
Can you show her the ropes?

06:46.120 --> 06:48.497
Believe me, boss,
it'd be a pleasure.

06:52.334 --> 06:53.918
(KEYBOARD CLACKING)

07:09.390 --> 07:11.183
How's the hostess
with the mostest?

07:11.267 --> 07:14.978
-Are our guests settled in?
-Uh, yes.

07:15.061 --> 07:17.313
Well, actually, there has been
a tiny change of plan.

07:20.274 --> 07:21.275
No way.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.277
Tools of the trade.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.278
We can't forget this.

07:27.029 --> 07:28.906
-You're joking.
-It was my mum's.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.991
I dug it out specially.

07:31.074 --> 07:32.867
No need to thank me.

07:32.951 --> 07:35.245
Has anybody ever told you
how irritating you are?

07:35.328 --> 07:37.871
Thanks for noticing.
I'm making a special
effort for you.

07:37.955 --> 07:39.623
Zoe should thank me.

07:39.707 --> 07:41.833
Seems to me
like she had a narrow escape.

07:41.916 --> 07:43.459
That'll be why she agreed
to come over tonight.

07:45.128 --> 07:46.879
Thought you'd be pleased.

07:50.173 --> 07:52.050
Today of all days!

07:52.134 --> 07:55.136
I hardly think Golly
put his back out on purpose.

07:55.219 --> 07:57.762
Besides,
Jess is quite capable.

07:57.847 --> 08:00.098
Oh, I'm sure you'll muddle
through without me.

08:00.181 --> 08:03.810
You know, I expected Donald
to kick up a fuss,

08:03.893 --> 08:06.145
but I had hoped that
you'd be behind me on this.

08:06.228 --> 08:07.813
Golly needs me.

08:07.896 --> 08:09.523
I can't just ignore
a friend in need.

08:09.607 --> 08:12.108
Which leaves me
without a hostess.

08:12.191 --> 08:14.736
I can't expect
Ewan and Amy to run things.

08:14.819 --> 08:16.946
Well, what about Donald?

08:17.030 --> 08:19.406
I'll pretend
I didn't hear that.

08:19.489 --> 08:22.284
There is someone
we haven't thought of.

08:25.369 --> 08:27.330
I wouldn't ask
if I wasn't desperate.

08:27.413 --> 08:30.123
Oh, flattery will get you
everywhere!

08:30.206 --> 08:32.042
So you'll do it?

08:32.125 --> 08:33.793
Well, what if I mess up?

08:33.876 --> 08:36.169
I mean, I'm not
a people person, Paul,

08:36.253 --> 08:39.715
I'm a sheep person.
Does he have any sheep?

08:39.798 --> 08:41.216
Not exactly.

08:41.299 --> 08:42.842
It'll just be
till Molly gets back.

08:42.926 --> 08:44.802
It's easy. All you've got
to do is keep smiling.

08:47.055 --> 08:48.096
How's that?

08:50.098 --> 08:51.683
-Perfect.
-Hmm.

08:55.518 --> 08:57.104
-Hi!
-Oh!

08:58.439 --> 09:00.607
Thank you so much
for this, Molly!

09:01.816 --> 09:03.192
You know,
I'd better make a move.

09:03.276 --> 09:05.403
Oh, and the big baby
is in there!

09:05.486 --> 09:06.946
I can manage by myself.

09:07.738 --> 09:09.698
Oh, really?

09:09.782 --> 09:13.368
From where I'm standing,
it looks as if I've arrived
in the nick of time.

09:32.217 --> 09:33.927
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

09:34.469 --> 09:35.719
Come in.

09:38.931 --> 09:40.349
Hello there.

09:40.432 --> 09:42.684
I'd like to introduce you
to your hostess, Iona.

09:51.608 --> 09:53.277
Um, Iona will be
looking after you today.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.404
If there's anything you need,
please don't hesitate
to ask her.

09:56.487 --> 09:59.031
I need signal. You don't have
signal anywhere.

09:59.115 --> 10:01.658
Uh, there's a phone
just outside in the hall.

10:01.741 --> 10:04.244
When it's working.

10:04.327 --> 10:06.203
Oh, later.

10:06.287 --> 10:10.916
I see Glenbogle
as filling a niche,
a real executive retreat.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.293
Think of it as a haven
of glorious isolation

10:13.376 --> 10:15.545
far away from the daily grind.

10:15.628 --> 10:16.671
Or civilisation.

10:17.754 --> 10:19.423
I assume you still have
bathrooms?

10:19.506 --> 10:20.841
Oh, 17.

10:22.301 --> 10:23.426
Yours is just through here.

10:29.098 --> 10:30.098
-(DONALD FARTING)
-Ugh!

10:31.182 --> 10:32.893
Oh, don't mind me! Carry on.

10:40.566 --> 10:42.358
(CHUCKLING)

10:42.442 --> 10:43.568
-Come here!
-(GASPS)

10:43.651 --> 10:45.194
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.238
Look, this is happening
with or without your blessing.

10:47.322 --> 10:49.948
One more trick like that
and you're out on your ear,
family or no family.

10:50.032 --> 10:53.743
Son, a Scotsman's
home is his castle,
or vice versa in my case.

10:53.826 --> 10:55.286
It'll take more
than idle threats

10:55.369 --> 10:57.622
to dethrone
this tartan barnacle!

11:06.754 --> 11:08.714
CATRIONA:
When I agreed to come,
it was on the understanding

11:08.797 --> 11:10.883
that we'd be spending
some more time together.

11:10.966 --> 11:12.342
We will, I promise.

11:13.343 --> 11:15.261
But this is business.

11:17.180 --> 11:19.973
Which comes first?

11:20.057 --> 11:23.392
But that does not mean
that you don't deserve
a little pleasure.

11:23.476 --> 11:24.602
Close your eyes.

11:26.562 --> 11:27.647
Close them.

11:41.116 --> 11:42.533
Now...

11:45.161 --> 11:47.913
-Viktor!
-Anything you want.

11:47.996 --> 11:50.666
Remember that.
Anything you want.

11:51.542 --> 11:53.376
You know what I want.

11:55.169 --> 11:57.964
They're waiting for me
downstairs.

11:58.047 --> 12:00.090
Yes, we will
discuss this later.

12:04.344 --> 12:06.637
Molly, there's really
no need for any of this.

12:06.720 --> 12:09.306
This place was an accident
waiting to happen.

12:09.390 --> 12:10.891
Well, we'll soon
have it shipshape.

12:10.975 --> 12:13.810
Jess and I can
deal with it later.
If you would just sit.

12:13.893 --> 12:15.728
Nonsense!

12:15.812 --> 12:17.604
There's something therapeutic
about a good clean.

12:17.688 --> 12:19.439
Clears the air.
Don't you think?

12:19.523 --> 12:22.025
-(SQUELCHING)
-Uh-uh.

12:22.109 --> 12:24.652
Once smelt, never forgotten.

12:27.613 --> 12:31.032
Let's see
if we've still got the knack.

12:31.116 --> 12:33.076
Ooh, little lamb!

12:34.619 --> 12:36.245
So what's he like?

12:41.374 --> 12:43.751
Don't worry, the hat
tells me all I need to know.

12:43.835 --> 12:45.128
Our stalker.

12:45.211 --> 12:46.754
VIKTOR: A woman.

12:46.838 --> 12:47.880
Thank you for noticing.

12:47.963 --> 12:49.673
I suppose she looks
fit enough.

12:49.756 --> 12:52.968
-She knows the hill?
-Born and bred in the heather.

12:59.015 --> 13:02.726
Magnificent, isn't he?

13:02.809 --> 13:06.478
A 16-pointer, but I don't
expect you to count them.

13:06.562 --> 13:09.231
-Hmm.
-He took some bringing down,
I can tell you.

13:09.315 --> 13:10.983
Best part of 1,000 yards.

13:11.066 --> 13:12.984
You shot this?

13:13.067 --> 13:15.612
Well, it was in my younger
days, but I claim
full responsibility.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.071
Hmm.

13:17.155 --> 13:19.615
Then this is what
I will shoot too.

13:19.698 --> 13:21.658
You can arrange?

13:21.742 --> 13:23.993
Well, heads like that are
very thin on the ground...

13:24.076 --> 13:26.871
-I don't see why
it should be a problem.
-Good!

13:26.954 --> 13:29.040
That is settled.

13:29.123 --> 13:30.457
We start now.

13:33.168 --> 13:34.836
So the gauntlet is laid down.

13:34.920 --> 13:38.005
Let's just hope
he's not a poor loser.
(CHUCKLES)

13:57.021 --> 13:58.397
JESS:
So, you were an astronaut?

13:58.481 --> 14:00.148
Cosmonaut.

14:00.232 --> 14:02.359
I flew six missions.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.277
I have several records.

14:04.361 --> 14:07.112
That's all I wanted to be
when I was a kid.
An astronaut.

14:07.196 --> 14:09.281
-Cosmonaut.
-PAUL: Yeah, right.

14:10.574 --> 14:13.034
I used to make rockets
out of cardboard boxes,

14:13.117 --> 14:15.745
you know,
pile one on top of the other.

14:15.828 --> 14:17.038
Then there was the launch pad.

14:17.121 --> 14:19.623
No, you would not
have been suitable.

14:19.706 --> 14:21.833
(CLEARS THROAT) You know who
I always felt sorry for?

14:21.917 --> 14:25.336
That wee dog
they sent up there when
it was first starting.

14:25.419 --> 14:28.339
-What was it called? Sputnik?
-Laika.

14:28.422 --> 14:31.049
She was Soviet hero.
Proud to go into space.

14:31.132 --> 14:33.885
(CHUCKLING) Not that she had
much choice in the matter.

14:36.887 --> 14:39.723
We, uh, we stalk on the land
as far as you can see.

14:39.807 --> 14:42.016
One hundred
head in a good year.

14:52.234 --> 14:53.401
(GUNSHOT)

14:59.155 --> 15:00.282
What?

15:02.075 --> 15:03.201
You could have
killed somebody.

15:03.285 --> 15:07.955
Killed somebody? Who?
There's nobody here.

15:08.038 --> 15:10.207
Is this how you plan
to treat all your guests?

15:10.291 --> 15:12.000
Just the ones who don't know
how to handle a gun.

15:12.083 --> 15:15.295
Look, look,
I think there's been
some kind of misunderstanding.

15:15.378 --> 15:18.380
On this estate
we shoot after we've stalked.

15:18.463 --> 15:22.593
Perhaps I didn't make that
clear enough from the start.

15:22.676 --> 15:25.636
Yes, I agree,
this was not made clear to me.

15:26.762 --> 15:29.890
So, from now we
will do things your way.

15:29.973 --> 15:31.349
Here, you can
find me something.

15:38.898 --> 15:41.232
The boiler will be
back on at 5:00.

15:41.316 --> 15:44.527
And what am I supposed
to do in the meantime?

15:44.611 --> 15:45.820
Well, there's always the loch.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.322
I know this amazing place.

15:48.405 --> 15:51.825
No one ever goes there.
Well, almost no one.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.535
You're serious, aren't you?

15:54.619 --> 15:56.537
Unbelievable.

16:00.081 --> 16:02.501
Dare I assume you have
a laundry service?

16:02.584 --> 16:04.336
-Oh, I'm sure that we can...
-Fine.

16:04.419 --> 16:07.671
This is going to need washing.
It's Italian cashmere, so...

16:07.755 --> 16:08.797
So?

16:09.840 --> 16:12.592
So be very careful.

16:15.929 --> 16:18.138
Hector was just the same
when his back went.

16:18.222 --> 16:20.432
Too much, too soon.

16:20.516 --> 16:23.059
And we can't have you
getting dehydrated.

16:32.734 --> 16:33.860
Perfect.

16:35.444 --> 16:37.738
-Molly, what are you doing?
-Mmm.

16:43.743 --> 16:46.204
Personally, I'd say it could
do another day or two.

16:46.287 --> 16:48.330
Yours not to reason why.

16:48.413 --> 16:50.541
-You going somewhere?
-Just a couple of messages.

16:50.624 --> 16:52.334
Thought we were supposed
to be working together.

16:52.417 --> 16:54.961
We are. I tell you what
to do and you do it.

16:56.295 --> 16:57.338
You kissed me!

16:59.881 --> 17:01.174
We all make mistakes.

17:01.758 --> 17:02.759
(GRUNTS)

17:04.261 --> 17:05.761
(MACHINE WHIRRING)

17:08.222 --> 17:11.223
JESS: So how rich is he?

17:11.307 --> 17:13.393
Think "wildest dreams,"
and treble it.

17:13.476 --> 17:14.769
Huh.

17:14.853 --> 17:17.436
Must be strange
having that much money.

17:17.521 --> 17:20.022
Enough to buy
anything you want.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.150
Or anyone.

17:23.526 --> 17:25.778
Oh, you think
I'm enjoying this?

17:25.862 --> 17:27.320
I didn't have a choice.

17:27.405 --> 17:29.990
We do this or the bank
calls in the loans.
All of them.

17:30.073 --> 17:31.908
Things have been
bad before, Paul.

17:31.992 --> 17:34.202
Not like this, believe me.

17:41.875 --> 17:43.418
Read them and weep.

17:50.591 --> 17:52.426
A 16-pointer.

17:52.509 --> 17:53.885
Maybe our luck's
about to change.

17:56.636 --> 17:57.679
Right, sir.

17:59.389 --> 18:00.432
MAN 1: You're all right here.

18:00.514 --> 18:02.434
You can stay in my good books.

18:04.769 --> 18:06.729
Unlike certain people
I could mention.

18:06.811 --> 18:08.354
How long are you gonna
keep this up?

18:08.439 --> 18:10.649
How about the rest of my life?

18:10.733 --> 18:12.525
MAN 2: Two of
the usual please, Zoe.

18:12.609 --> 18:15.820
Look, I want to
make it up to you tonight.

18:15.904 --> 18:17.529
-Something special.
-I'm busy.

18:18.447 --> 18:19.448
Doing what?

18:20.282 --> 18:21.783
I'll think of something.

18:34.711 --> 18:36.378
What are you doing?

18:36.462 --> 18:37.463
Grovelling.

18:41.925 --> 18:42.967
How special.

18:48.806 --> 18:52.100
It's tiny.
What am I gonna tell her?

18:52.184 --> 18:53.184
Whoops?

18:58.231 --> 19:00.732
It's about 300 yards.

19:00.816 --> 19:03.026
Might be a slight
drop on the shot.

19:03.109 --> 19:05.277
The wind down there
is stronger than you think.

19:05.361 --> 19:06.612
It's coming across you.

19:06.695 --> 19:09.448
Yes, yes, yes,
I've done this many times.

19:15.495 --> 19:17.287
Complete silence, please.

19:21.416 --> 19:22.751
(GUNSHOT)

19:28.422 --> 19:29.798
She moved.

19:29.881 --> 19:32.759
-She moved and made me miss.
-I didn't.

19:32.843 --> 19:34.594
I don't miss.

19:34.678 --> 19:36.971
I demand an apology.

19:37.054 --> 19:39.014
(CHUCKLES) If Jess
said she didn't move...

19:39.098 --> 19:43.059
So now are you
calling me a liar
in front of my driver?

19:43.143 --> 19:44.185
No one's calling
anyone anything.

19:44.269 --> 19:46.937
Wait. Viktor's right.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.940
My elbow slipped as he shot.

19:50.649 --> 19:51.650
I apologise.

19:52.442 --> 19:53.860
Yeah. Yeah.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.113
I don't miss.

20:02.409 --> 20:04.910
(SIGHS) Like you said,
we need his money.

20:04.994 --> 20:07.329
And right now
my pride comes cheap.

20:25.303 --> 20:26.471
Ah!

20:27.346 --> 20:29.598
No Ewan?

20:29.681 --> 20:32.100
I was hoping he would
rustle up a sandwich or two.

20:33.226 --> 20:35.060
-He's gone out.
-Ah.

20:35.144 --> 20:38.564
Well, here's hoping
he took my advice.

20:38.647 --> 20:42.192
Though the course of true love
never did run smooth.

20:42.275 --> 20:44.736
What, you think
it's true love?

20:44.819 --> 20:47.321
Not just true like,
or true good friends?

20:47.946 --> 20:49.531
Well...

20:51.033 --> 20:53.159
It's difficult to say,

20:53.242 --> 20:55.953
but you could always ask him.

20:56.037 --> 20:58.789
I could, but it's not
really any of my business.

20:59.706 --> 21:02.375
Quite. Quite.

21:02.459 --> 21:04.503
Well, I'll get back
to my sandwich.

21:18.555 --> 21:20.808
Oh, it's you.

21:22.892 --> 21:25.144
I was just looking around.

21:25.228 --> 21:27.480
Whose room is this?

21:27.563 --> 21:30.190
Oh, one of the girlies
has a wee one.

21:35.986 --> 21:40.157
All these
beautiful old things.

21:40.241 --> 21:43.409
Yeah, I think it's always
been a nursery for the family.

21:43.493 --> 21:44.869
He's lucky.

21:45.995 --> 21:47.204
The little boy.

21:48.664 --> 21:50.415
-Is it a little boy?
-Mmm-hmm.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.751
You can leave that
in the room.

21:53.835 --> 21:57.338
Actually, I...
I came to apologise.

21:58.381 --> 21:59.381
It's ruined?

22:00.715 --> 22:02.509
Have you got any idea
how much that cost?

22:02.592 --> 22:04.177
Well, of course
we'll replace it.

22:04.261 --> 22:05.886
Well, from what
Viktor tells me,

22:05.970 --> 22:08.889
I doubt any of you
could afford it.

22:08.973 --> 22:10.141
Oh, just get out.

22:19.606 --> 22:21.191
Smells good.

22:21.275 --> 22:24.902
Say what you like about me,
I cook a mean steak.

22:24.986 --> 22:27.405
Zoe doesn't know
what she's missing.

22:29.281 --> 22:31.116
I'm not stupid.

22:31.199 --> 22:34.161
So did it work?
The big apology.

22:34.244 --> 22:35.327
Can I get back to you
on that one?

22:37.413 --> 22:40.541
Well, I brought it. Now what?

22:40.624 --> 22:42.667
You won't be disappointed.

22:42.750 --> 22:45.086
Well, let's hope not, eh?

22:45.170 --> 22:48.005
And, uh, love the look.

22:55.928 --> 22:57.430
-More tea?
-Molly...

23:00.098 --> 23:02.684
Molly, could you do
something for me?

23:02.768 --> 23:05.686
Silly me, I forgot.
Time for your pills.

23:05.770 --> 23:08.481
No, not the pills, this. This!

23:09.690 --> 23:12.066
I want you to stop this.

23:13.109 --> 23:14.569
I don't understand.

23:15.528 --> 23:17.905
You're a MacDonald.

23:17.988 --> 23:21.533
Cooking and cleaning
in my house is just not right.

23:21.617 --> 23:22.992
But Jess asked me to...

23:23.075 --> 23:26.245
Yeah, well, she should
have checked with me first.

23:26.329 --> 23:27.914
Are you saying
you don't want me here?

23:27.997 --> 23:33.126
No, you are welcome
in my home any time you want,

23:33.210 --> 23:34.960
but not like this!

23:36.378 --> 23:37.880
I see.

23:40.132 --> 23:44.511
I thought that's
what friends did,
helped each other out.

23:44.594 --> 23:45.595
I see I was wrong.

23:46.678 --> 23:49.264
Hello, hello.
How's my brave soldier?

23:52.017 --> 23:53.601
I think I should be going.

23:54.644 --> 23:56.354
I'm sorry. I'm just...

23:56.437 --> 23:57.897
So sorry.

24:01.983 --> 24:03.026
Dad?

24:26.629 --> 24:28.464
VIKTOR: I ordered
dinner in our room.

24:31.258 --> 24:32.592
I thought you'd quit.

24:33.635 --> 24:35.010
I started again.

24:42.725 --> 24:45.437
Imagine living
in a place like this.

24:45.520 --> 24:51.275
One family, father and son,
generation after generation.

24:51.358 --> 24:54.026
I understand
what you are asking me for.

24:55.319 --> 24:57.113
Really.

24:57.196 --> 25:01.450
When we married I promised you
everything your heart desired.

25:01.533 --> 25:03.452
I never go back on my word.

25:05.870 --> 25:07.705
-You mean it?
-Of course.

25:28.930 --> 25:32.142
-Can I give you some advice?
-Sure.

25:33.518 --> 25:35.936
See, when you get yours done,
lose the hat.

25:38.314 --> 25:40.066
He'd side with Donald.

25:40.149 --> 25:42.650
Hotel Glenbogle? Unthinkable.

25:44.360 --> 25:47.905
Well, estates like this have
always changed to survive.

25:47.988 --> 25:50.657
What if they don't survive?

25:50.741 --> 25:51.825
What do you mean?

25:54.786 --> 25:58.331
Monday is payday,
Golly, Jess, Ewan.

26:00.665 --> 26:02.334
I haven't got a penny.

26:03.126 --> 26:05.878
Not even close.

26:05.961 --> 26:09.215
Viktor Zinchenko
is my last throw of the dice.

26:09.298 --> 26:11.758
Then they don't know
about the money?

26:13.802 --> 26:18.347
Surely if you told them,
just explained the situation,
they would understand.

26:19.515 --> 26:21.725
I'm their laird.

26:21.809 --> 26:23.893
That makes it
my responsibility.

26:25.103 --> 26:26.687
My watch.

26:29.481 --> 26:31.858
Father to son for generations,

26:31.942 --> 26:35.778
and all that was
ever asked of me was
to maintain that tradition.

26:38.906 --> 26:41.533
Instead, all I've done
is let them all down.

26:57.088 --> 26:58.089
Mmm.

26:59.798 --> 27:01.675
So are you getting in?

27:01.758 --> 27:03.635
Well, I've got my bubbles.

27:04.844 --> 27:07.179
All I need now is my apology.

27:07.263 --> 27:08.723
Well, I was...

27:08.806 --> 27:13.685
But I've always thought
that actions speak
louder than words.

27:21.900 --> 27:24.777
You've got to be kidding.
I'll freeze!

27:24.861 --> 27:27.697
Oh, it'll do wonders
for your pores.

27:29.740 --> 27:33.744
Let's get this straight. I go
in and we're back together.

27:33.827 --> 27:35.661
The way it used to be.
You and me.

27:35.745 --> 27:37.538
If that's what you want.

27:37.621 --> 27:39.290
Full privileges.

27:39.373 --> 27:41.875
More than you ever imagined.

27:55.887 --> 27:58.056
-Cold?
-(PANTING)

27:58.139 --> 28:00.265
-Good.
-Now do you believe me?

28:00.348 --> 28:03.852
Oh, I believe you all right.
Doesn't mean I forgive you.

28:03.935 --> 28:05.936
But you just said
if I go in...

28:06.020 --> 28:08.314
Ewan, I trusted you
and you made me look stupid.

28:09.690 --> 28:11.107
I just wanted you
to know how it felt.

28:24.243 --> 28:25.953
GOLLY: I told you, I'm fine.

28:26.037 --> 28:28.872
Sometimes I don't think
you use the little brain
that you were born with.

28:28.955 --> 28:31.416
I have served the MacDonalds
for most of my days.

28:31.500 --> 28:34.877
Aye, and things
have changed, Dad,
whether you like it or not.

28:34.960 --> 28:38.214
Molly may be a MacDonald, but
she's also your oldest friend.

28:38.297 --> 28:41.341
Shut her out now
and you'll lose that forever.

28:41.424 --> 28:43.259
If that's what you want, fine.

28:43.343 --> 28:47.554
If not, and if I were you,
I'd do something about it.

28:47.638 --> 28:49.348
-(SLAPS)
-Oh!

28:49.431 --> 28:51.725
Well, at least it's original.

28:51.809 --> 28:54.435
Most men just get a Porsche.
I know I did.

28:56.813 --> 28:58.189
Down the hatch, old son.

29:02.109 --> 29:06.445
The good ship Humiliation,
and all who sail therein.

29:06.529 --> 29:08.197
-I'm not laughing.
-Well, why not?

29:08.280 --> 29:10.199
It was a magnificent
improvisation

29:10.281 --> 29:12.033
and no woman
who wasn't serious

29:12.117 --> 29:14.160
would have gone
to such lengths.

29:14.244 --> 29:16.245
All you have to do
is go cap in hand,

29:16.328 --> 29:18.247
and Robert is your
father's brother.

29:18.330 --> 29:19.456
What if I don't want to?

29:19.540 --> 29:20.624
Oh, now, now.

29:20.708 --> 29:22.792
Churlishness is very
unsportsmanlike.

29:22.875 --> 29:23.876
It's not that.

29:24.877 --> 29:26.045
It's just...

29:27.004 --> 29:28.630
I think I like someone else.

29:28.714 --> 29:30.340
Ah.

29:30.424 --> 29:31.675
Anyone we know?

29:31.758 --> 29:33.385
Oh, no, no, no,
full disclosure is optional.

29:33.468 --> 29:38.139
The important thing is
we are dealing with
a classic love triangle,

29:38.222 --> 29:42.642
and in that case
you must disregard
all my previous advice.

29:42.726 --> 29:43.893
Not a problem.

29:43.977 --> 29:47.146
The theory is simple,
the execution complex.

29:47.229 --> 29:54.569
The trick, in my experience,
is to listen to this
and ignore this.

29:54.652 --> 29:57.488
Or any other part of the
anatomy that springs to mind.

30:09.373 --> 30:12.584
Well, I've tried to help
but all I've done is
make things worse.

30:12.667 --> 30:14.169
I mean, look at me.

30:14.252 --> 30:17.087
I'm not exactly
hostess material, am I?

30:17.171 --> 30:18.630
It's not your fault.

30:18.714 --> 30:20.090
When Jess called...

30:20.174 --> 30:24.010
Well, let's just say I didn't
need to be asked twice.

30:24.093 --> 30:26.220
Somehow, when things change,

30:26.304 --> 30:28.805
it's easier to put
your head in the sand
and leave it there.

30:28.889 --> 30:30.223
Oh, no,
I didn't mean that he...

30:30.307 --> 30:31.808
No, no, you were
right to tell me.

30:31.892 --> 30:36.187
I'm glad Paul felt able
to confide in you.

30:36.270 --> 30:40.815
Sometimes it's easier
to talk to someone
that you're not close to.

30:40.899 --> 30:42.150
Of course.

30:42.233 --> 30:45.278
Anyway, the important thing is
he needs our help.

30:45.362 --> 30:49.073
Oh! Well, what exactly
did you have in mind?

30:55.745 --> 30:57.288
Who's this?

30:57.372 --> 30:59.998
The eighth Laird of Glenbogle.

31:00.082 --> 31:02.751
Tried to form an alliance
with the English.

31:02.834 --> 31:03.919
What happened to him?

31:04.002 --> 31:06.587
Well, first he was hung,
drawn and quartered.

31:06.670 --> 31:09.632
Then they dragged his body
around the estate
with wild horses.

31:09.715 --> 31:12.676
And finally, they just
fed him to the wolves.

31:12.759 --> 31:14.302
Charming.

31:14.386 --> 31:15.595
He wasn't a very nice man.

31:19.682 --> 31:23.434
I knew they were
here somewhere!

31:23.518 --> 31:27.730

then the best they are
going to get.

31:30.273 --> 31:34.235
DONALD: I have made
my position perfectly clear!

31:34.318 --> 31:39.281
No self-respecting MacDonald
would stoop to such a thing.

31:39.365 --> 31:42.242
Even if it means proving
yourself indispensable?

31:44.911 --> 31:46.203
Indispensable?

31:47.996 --> 31:50.833
It occurs to me that any new
business partner is going to

31:50.916 --> 31:52.458
want to make changes,

31:52.542 --> 31:55.044
cut out the dead wood,
as they say.

31:55.128 --> 31:58.797
Which is why I thought you'd
jump at the chance to help,

31:58.880 --> 32:01.258
considering the
likely alternatives.

32:01.341 --> 32:03.427
DONALD: Alternative?

32:03.510 --> 32:05.636
MOLLY: I found
this in Paul's office.

32:06.846 --> 32:08.347
He wouldn't dare.

Are you prepared to risk it?

32:27.697 --> 32:29.573
Tell me I'm dreaming.

32:29.656 --> 32:30.991
Believe me,
from where I'm standing

32:31.074 --> 32:32.826
it looks more
like a nightmare.

32:32.909 --> 32:33.952
Milk and sugar?

32:37.872 --> 32:39.206
They did this?

32:41.791 --> 32:42.876
It's ruined.

32:46.879 --> 32:49.173

32:49.256 --> 32:50.841

Well, it's amazing
what happens when
you ask for a little help.

34:41.933 --> 34:43.560

you want to tell me?

34:59.948 --> 35:03.285
you didn't know when
you had a good thing going,

35:03.368 --> 35:07.121
but now you've seen
the error of your ways,

35:07.204 --> 35:08.914
you'd like things to go back
to how they were.

35:12.125 --> 35:14.210
-How did I do?
-Don't.

35:17.838 --> 35:20.424
I do like you, but that's all.

drive him around the estate.

Yeah. Round and round

drifted off.

36:01.625 --> 36:02.876

in the morning,

36:02.959 --> 36:05.669
there they'd both be,
dead to the world.

for us to forget what we are

45:43.735 --> 45:44.736
Shh.

45:50.449 --> 45:52.534
What are you doing?

45:58.163 --> 45:59.498
(CLICKING TONGUE)

46:00.707 --> 46:01.708
(IMITATES PURRING)

46:06.003 --> 46:07.129
Who's a lovely cat?

46:08.714 --> 46:11.925
Oom-pa-pa. Oom-pa-pa.

46:13.176 --> 46:14.928
Da wapetta-wapetta.

46:15.678 --> 46:19.056
Ooh. (IMITATES PURRING)

46:19.139 --> 46:21.307
(CHANTING IN LATIN)

46:29.731 --> 46:31.525
Da wapetta-wapetta.

46:31.608 --> 46:35.820
Oom-pa-pa. Oom-pa-pa.
Oom-pa-pa. Oom-pa-pa.

46:38.531 --> 46:40.365
You're a lovely little cat.

46:41.575 --> 46:43.410
Who's a lovely little cat?

46:44.411 --> 46:45.953
(IMITATES PURRING)

46:48.247 --> 46:49.707
(PANTHER PURRING)

46:52.375 --> 46:53.376
(SIGHS)

46:55.837 --> 46:57.921
(WHISPERS) That was amazing!

46:58.005 --> 47:03.135
Ah. It's just a little trick
I picked up from some
old Swahili lion whisperer.

47:03.217 --> 47:04.969
I can make him roll over
if you want.

47:05.052 --> 47:07.096
Mmm. No.

47:22.317 --> 47:23.651
How is she?

47:24.319 --> 47:25.320
Recovering.

47:26.237 --> 47:28.238
Thank you for what you did.

47:29.323 --> 47:30.407
It was nothing.

47:30.490 --> 47:33.284
No, it was me who did nothing.

47:36.412 --> 47:38.581
My wife wants a child.

47:41.041 --> 47:43.210
And you don't?

47:43.293 --> 47:45.419
I tell her I like
my life too much,

47:45.502 --> 47:48.047
the money, the travel,
but it's not true.

47:49.298 --> 47:52.717
The truth,
I was married before.

47:53.718 --> 47:56.804
We had a child
together, Tanya.

47:56.888 --> 48:00.557
My ex-wife took her,
along with a few million.

48:00.641 --> 48:02.935
She used me to get
baby she wanted

48:03.018 --> 48:06.229
and I swore I would never
make same mistake again.

48:07.480 --> 48:10.649
All I ever wanted
was trophy wife.

48:10.732 --> 48:12.984
Is that too much
to ask for, huh?

48:14.402 --> 48:16.278
You haven't told
Catriona all this, have you?

48:16.362 --> 48:20.866
(CHUCKLING) I can see that you
have never married.

48:20.950 --> 48:25.703
I hoped that the money,
the gifts would be enough
to keep her happy.

48:27.162 --> 48:28.330
You see, Mr MacDonald,

48:28.413 --> 48:31.458
you should never invest
your money in hope.

48:33.334 --> 48:35.545
Perhaps your wife
deserves a chance.

48:35.628 --> 48:37.004
To break my heart? Hmm?

48:37.922 --> 48:39.381
Do you love her?

48:41.216 --> 48:43.969
Yes, I love her.

48:44.052 --> 48:47.847
Then the way I see it,
whatever you choose,
it's still a gamble.

48:47.930 --> 48:50.558
But better a sheep
than a lamb, surely.

48:50.641 --> 48:53.643
Lamb? Sheep? What?

48:53.726 --> 48:57.771
No MacDonald would ever
willingly sell this house
to you or anyone else.

48:59.147 --> 49:01.692
Looks like we'll have
to take our chances.

49:02.901 --> 49:03.985
Hmm.

49:04.068 --> 49:06.487
Maybe you should do
the same thing, Viktor.

49:16.328 --> 49:17.538
I can't talk to you right now.

49:17.621 --> 49:19.790
Please, just listen to me.

49:23.543 --> 49:25.920
There's something
I want to tell you.

49:39.472 --> 49:42.893
Her name is Tanya.
She's six years old.

49:44.269 --> 49:47.062
But now she would be 20.

49:49.690 --> 49:53.359
She's my daughter.
I wish that I had told you.

49:53.943 --> 49:56.112
(INAUDIBLE)

50:14.211 --> 50:16.128
What is that?

50:16.212 --> 50:19.924
It's panther dung.
Foxes can't stand it.

50:20.007 --> 50:21.299
They may have a point.

50:24.594 --> 50:28.013
Suited you, you know,
the scrubbed up look.

50:28.096 --> 50:29.515
If you ever tire
of all this...

50:29.598 --> 50:33.309
Oh, no, no way.
I'm a sheep person, remember?

50:33.392 --> 50:36.354
Love me, love my wellies.

50:36.437 --> 50:37.897
I'll bear that in mind.

50:40.857 --> 50:42.859
So are they
still in their room?

50:43.944 --> 50:46.904
Busy making a little
cosmonaut.

50:46.987 --> 50:49.114
Look at you.
You're a hotel owner,

50:49.198 --> 50:51.366
lion tamer and now
marriage guidance.

50:51.449 --> 50:55.370
If it's all right with you,
I think I'll stick
to being a laird.

50:55.453 --> 50:57.996
Oh, aye, it must
be awful for you.

50:58.080 --> 51:01.416
Still, seeing as
you're here...

51:08.047 --> 51:09.339
DONALD: Friends?

51:09.422 --> 51:11.758
-The ultimate deal killer.
-Yes.

51:11.842 --> 51:13.885
I once had a friend
who was a woman.

51:13.969 --> 51:15.553
-What happened?
-We got married.

51:15.636 --> 51:17.555
Oh, it was
a very brief affair.

51:17.638 --> 51:20.224
Thirty six hours,
if I remember correctly.

51:21.724 --> 51:23.601
The worst day
and a half of my life.

51:23.685 --> 51:26.521
Is this more advice
or just a random trip
down memory lane?

51:26.604 --> 51:28.981
Oh, I never give advice.
Useless!

51:29.064 --> 51:31.608
A wise man doesn't need it
and a fool won't take it.

51:33.442 --> 51:35.653
Remind me
to never talk to you again.

51:54.294 --> 51:55.295
(MAN WHISTLES)

52:04.969 --> 52:06.262
What will you do with him?

52:06.345 --> 52:08.014
A local zoo have
agreed to take him.

52:08.097 --> 52:09.723
Pity. I was getting
so attached to him

52:09.806 --> 52:12.184
-I was considering adoption.
-Think again.

52:17.271 --> 52:19.273
Thank you.

52:19.356 --> 52:25.236
So, for three nights,
plus tip, hmm?

52:25.320 --> 52:27.404
For you.

52:27.488 --> 52:29.490
No, no, no, Viktor.
I can't accept this.

52:29.573 --> 52:33.534
A small price to pay
for a second chance.

52:33.618 --> 52:37.455
But you are a proud man,
Cossack blood I think,

52:37.538 --> 52:40.540
so you do
what you want with it.

52:40.624 --> 52:45.878
A word of advice. No Cossack
ever became hotelier.

52:46.796 --> 52:49.507
Cosmonaut, maybe. (CHUCKLES)

52:58.972 --> 53:00.349
So how much did they give you?

53:03.017 --> 53:05.561
Well, let's just say we'll
live to fight another day.

53:05.645 --> 53:06.813
-(HORN HONKING)
-More guests?

53:11.024 --> 53:13.652
Actually, I was thinking
of a safari park.
