"And so,
the white night opened the door

00:17.160 --> 00:21.629
"and saw more gold and jewels
than he could ever imagine.

00:21.631 --> 00:24.081
"The wizard said,
'give me the princess

00:24.083 --> 00:27.418
"and you shall have
all the riches in the world.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.756
"The White Knight gazed upon the
wizard and saw it was the devil,

00:31.758 --> 00:35.760
who had already banished
the villagers' wives."

00:38.313 --> 00:41.415
"'I said, give me the princess''.

00:41.417 --> 00:43.234
'Never, he cried,'

01:09.127 --> 01:11.545
Look after your sister.

01:21.339 --> 01:22.390
No!

01:22.392 --> 01:23.357
No!

01:23.359 --> 01:26.644
No! No!

01:26.646 --> 01:28.696
No! No!

01:28.698 --> 01:32.867
No! No! Help!

01:32.869 --> 01:35.319
Aah! Help me!

01:35.321 --> 01:37.371
Help!

01:37.373 --> 01:41.742
No!

01:46.030 --> 01:48.031
I don't know about this.

01:48.033 --> 01:50.668
Mike, will you stop
being a wimp.

02:09.721 --> 02:11.405
They say there's no escape.

02:11.407 --> 02:14.408
The demons will always
find you.

02:17.413 --> 02:20.865
Mike.

02:20.867 --> 02:22.583
Mike?

02:30.092 --> 02:32.443
Holy crap.

02:39.551 --> 02:41.719
Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry
for the delay.

02:41.721 --> 02:43.888
The system was down.
We overwork her.

02:43.890 --> 02:45.255
And I had to go into
the belly of the beast,

02:45.257 --> 02:48.526
who I affectionately
nickname Persephone,

02:48.528 --> 02:51.145
and do some machine
whispering--thank you--

02:51.147 --> 02:53.731
which is good, because
this one is a doozy.

02:53.733 --> 02:55.232
Emma Baker.

02:55.234 --> 02:57.902
38, math teacher
from Medford, Oregon.

02:57.904 --> 03:00.237
She went missing
17 days ago,

03:00.239 --> 03:02.907
and her body was found yesterday
afternoon at St. Baldwin's.

03:02.909 --> 03:05.826
St. Baldwin's is a now defunct
psychiatric hospital

03:05.828 --> 03:08.162
for the criminally insane.
Now, that is in Salem, Oregon,

03:08.164 --> 03:10.247
which is 230 miles away
from Medford,

03:10.249 --> 03:12.883
and we've been called in for
the bizarre nature of the case.

03:12.885 --> 03:13.968
Observe the photos.

03:13.970 --> 03:15.503
Wow. Look at that dress.

03:15.505 --> 03:18.005
Was she going
to a Renaissance fair?

03:18.007 --> 03:19.924
Not with her feet bound.
And missing persons report

03:19.926 --> 03:21.559
says that she was
in jeans and a T-shirt.

03:21.561 --> 03:23.460
But look at how
she's laid out.

03:23.462 --> 03:25.930
It's almost like it's a ceremony
and she's the sacrifice.

03:25.932 --> 03:27.565
There's obvious staging
going on.

03:27.567 --> 03:29.767
Could it be
a ritualistic killing?

03:29.769 --> 03:30.985
And cause of death
is still unclear.

03:30.987 --> 03:33.153
The M.E. report shows no sign
of sexual assault

03:33.155 --> 03:35.272
or mutilation except
mangled and missing fingernails.

03:35.274 --> 03:37.691
You know, there were rumors
of satanic rites being performed

03:37.693 --> 03:39.193
at Byberry Hospital
in Pennsylvania,

03:39.195 --> 03:40.945
which is also
an abandoned asylum.

03:40.947 --> 03:42.846
You know, judging by
all the graffiti,

03:42.848 --> 03:44.498
this place isn't
exactly locked down.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.148
Uh, yeah. The local P.D.
said that vandals and vagrants

03:46.173 --> 03:47.373
have been breaking in.

03:47.453 --> 03:50.037
Which means she could have been
killed elsewhere and placed here.

03:50.039 --> 03:51.655
She had limestone
under her fingernails,

03:51.657 --> 03:53.541
but limestone wouldn't have been
used when this asylum was built,

03:53.543 --> 03:55.158
so she was obviously
held somewhere else.

03:55.160 --> 03:57.878
Well, the bottom line is,
the unsub transported her

03:57.880 --> 04:00.264
hundreds of miles from
her hometown for a reason.

04:00.266 --> 04:02.016
We just need to find out
what that reasons.

04:02.018 --> 04:03.634
Wheels up in 30.

04:04.686 --> 04:07.021
Please!

04:09.124 --> 04:11.358
Tell me what you want!

04:14.947 --> 04:17.982
Oh!

04:17.983 --> 04:20.534
I'll do anything!

04:20.536 --> 04:22.152
No, no.

04:33.965 --> 04:35.365
Aah!

04:38.471 --> 04:41.972
Let me out of here!

04:41.974 --> 04:45.676
No! Aah! No!

04:45.678 --> 04:47.544
Let me out of here!

04:47.546 --> 04:49.346
Aah!

Emma Baker was

No children.

05:46.012 --> 05:49.013
She has a boyfriend, though,
who's a drummer in a Goth band.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.766
Her Facebook has pictures of them
at the Bram Stoker Vampire festival

05:51.768 --> 05:54.719
and Slayerama, which is a
celebration of all things Gothic.

05:54.721 --> 05:57.555
Hmm. Teacher by day,
Elvira by night.

05:57.557 --> 05:59.157
Clearly
this is a woman

05:59.159 --> 06:01.159
with two different sides
to her personality.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.660
Yeah, the boyfriend's band
pours fake blood

06:02.662 --> 06:04.612
all over themselves
on stage.

06:04.614 --> 06:07.231
Ok, so if these two were Satanists,
it wouldn't be a stretch.

06:07.233 --> 06:09.584
Garcia, has the boyfriend
been questioned by local P.D.?

06:09.586 --> 06:12.704
He has by phone.
He's got an airtight alibi.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.740
Him and his band have been on
tour to Asia for the last month.

06:15.742 --> 06:16.925
Well, if it's not
the boyfriend,

06:16.927 --> 06:18.409
the unsub could be
someone in their circle.

06:18.411 --> 06:20.462
Emily, you asked earlier if she
was going to a Renaissance fair.

06:20.464 --> 06:21.713
There's something to that.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.099
Based on the dress, there could
be more of a connection

06:24.101 --> 06:25.850
to history
than the occult.

06:25.852 --> 06:28.103
Renaissance fairs typically
replicate 16th Century England.

06:28.105 --> 06:31.423
They've surged in popularity
since they began in the 1960s.

06:31.425 --> 06:32.941
And it's not just
a bunch of nerds in costumes

06:32.943 --> 06:34.359
eating turkey legs,
you guys.

06:34.361 --> 06:37.762
A different time is somehow very
important to this unsub.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.705
Agent Hotchner?

06:47.707 --> 06:48.907
Detective Gassner.
Yes, sir.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.125
Of course.
Thanks for coming out.

06:50.127 --> 06:51.626
This is Agent Rossi.
Hi.

06:51.628 --> 06:54.963
Uh...Welcome
to St. Baldwin's.

06:54.965 --> 06:56.331
Creepy, isn't it?

06:56.333 --> 06:57.799
They shut it down
in '98

06:57.801 --> 07:00.135
after a fire burned down
the East wing.

07:00.137 --> 07:02.286
Any idea what part of
the hospital we're in now?

07:02.288 --> 07:03.755
This is the female ward.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.924
The old day room
to be exact.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.759
Hotch, take a look at this.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.978
The victim
was laid out here,

07:09.980 --> 07:11.563
but the bed wasn't here
originally.

07:11.565 --> 07:14.182
It was dragged across
the floor from in there.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.733
Those are the old
patient rooms.

07:15.735 --> 07:17.769
These beds are heavy. This unsub
went to a lot of trouble

07:17.771 --> 07:19.771
to make sure that
the victim was placed

07:19.773 --> 07:22.474
right here in the middle
of the room.

07:22.476 --> 07:23.641
That is significant.

07:23.643 --> 07:25.193
The unsub knows this place.

07:25.195 --> 07:26.828
Could be a former patient.

07:26.830 --> 07:29.080
I'll have Garcia
pull up a list.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.482
We, uh, photographed
all the walls,

07:31.484 --> 07:32.951
and we're running
a paint analysis

07:32.953 --> 07:35.086
to find the most
recent graffiti.

07:35.088 --> 07:38.006
Maybe a tagger
saw something...

07:38.008 --> 07:39.924
or the unsub left his mark.

08:06.435 --> 08:08.152
My son.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.321
You've been so brave.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.940
I have no fear.

08:11.942 --> 08:13.241
You will.

08:13.243 --> 08:14.809
The wives
will be stronger.

08:14.811 --> 08:17.795
It's an honor
to be chosen defender.

08:17.797 --> 08:20.798
An honor and a curse
for this family.

08:20.800 --> 08:24.802
Regardless,
it is our sacred duty.

08:24.804 --> 08:26.838
Be vigilant.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.807
Never let your guard down.

08:29.809 --> 08:32.543
Send a warning.

08:32.544 --> 08:35.763
Show them our strength.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.649
Be ruthless
and destroy them

08:37.650 --> 08:40.518
before they destroy us.

08:41.604 --> 08:44.489
I will.

08:44.491 --> 08:47.408
I promise.

08:52.331 --> 08:55.033
The cause of death
was nicotine poisoning.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.918
Was it something in
the white-face makeup?

08:56.920 --> 08:58.569
No. No, the makeup's
harmless.

08:58.571 --> 09:00.738
And it was applied postmortem.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.239
But the gown
that she was wearing

09:02.241 --> 09:04.208
was soaked in
a nicotine-based pesticide,

09:04.210 --> 09:06.277
so it was absorbed
through her skin.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.545
Was that a quick death?

09:07.547 --> 09:09.130
At high doses,
people can die immediately,

09:09.132 --> 09:10.748
but based on the levels
in her bloodstream,

09:10.750 --> 09:12.717
she probably died
in about an hour.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.719
Within minutes she was
probably sweating

09:14.721 --> 09:16.237
and then experiencing
shortness of breath

09:16.239 --> 09:17.639
and possibly seizures.

09:17.641 --> 09:20.291
So she didn't have the
wherewithal to remove the dress.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.126
Well, even if she did,
she couldn't.

09:22.128 --> 09:23.695
That corset was laced
so tightly, it left

09:23.720 --> 09:25.204
lividity marks on her chest.

09:25.598 --> 09:28.816
Plus, someone sewed the
dress shut over the closure.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.285
I'm guessing she wasn't
sewn in by choice.

09:30.287 --> 09:31.602
Take look over here.

09:34.206 --> 09:35.957
Is that more
nicotine bruising?

09:35.959 --> 09:38.843
Well, you'd think so. But the
clothing wasn't tight on her skin here.

09:38.845 --> 09:40.495
See, the epidermis
is thickened

09:40.497 --> 09:42.080
and has signs of
abscess formations.

09:42.082 --> 09:45.583
She was submerged in water for
some time before she was killed.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.252
So we were right. He held her
and tortured her first.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.722
The question is, why?

09:50.724 --> 09:52.256
The unsub's not
the first to do this.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.909
Poisoned garments actually have
an incredibly long history,

09:54.911 --> 09:57.729
going all the way back to the shirt
of Nessus, which killed Hercules.

09:57.731 --> 10:00.565
Ok, so,
I double-checked,

10:00.567 --> 10:04.686
and this fabric is not manufactured
for commercial sale.

10:04.688 --> 10:06.303
Is it possibly
something from the past

10:06.305 --> 10:08.239
that was
maybe discontinued?

10:08.241 --> 10:10.024
No. I can tell you
one thing, though.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.309
The fabric is
a double-layer brocade.

10:12.311 --> 10:14.395
It was probably custom-made
for someone,

10:14.397 --> 10:15.813
and it's very pricy.

10:15.815 --> 10:17.332
Ok, now what about
the dress?

10:17.334 --> 10:18.783
Did anything stand out?

10:18.785 --> 10:20.752
Well, it's homemade,
for one.

10:20.754 --> 10:21.919
Ok, how do you
know that?

10:21.921 --> 10:23.454
Well, the seams are uneven.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.673
Whoever the seamstress is,
she isn't very skilled.

10:25.675 --> 10:27.175
What makes you so sure
it's a woman?

10:27.177 --> 10:28.659
Well, there's some
detail work in here

10:28.661 --> 10:30.128
that would require
small hands.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.231
Oh, and this is interesting.
See, now, the stitching on this hem,

10:33.233 --> 10:36.167
it's narrow in some places
and wider in others.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.602
Small hands,
easily distracted.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.670
Let me ask you this. How old
do you think someone could be

10:39.672 --> 10:41.673
and still effectively
sew this?

10:41.675 --> 10:43.358
Well...a pattern
of this complexity,

10:43.360 --> 10:45.026
they'd have to be
a teenager.

10:45.028 --> 10:46.194
Ok, thanks.

10:46.196 --> 10:48.813
Based on the size
of the victim's body,

10:48.815 --> 10:51.515
I think only an adult male
would be able to lift her

10:51.517 --> 10:52.850
and move a hospital bed,
so...

10:52.852 --> 10:55.286
What, are we looking
at a team here?

10:55.288 --> 10:58.623
Or an unsub with a young
accomplice who's being coerced.

11:11.553 --> 11:13.706
I didn't know if you'd
want breakfast or lunch,

11:13.731 --> 11:14.931
so I made both.

11:15.341 --> 11:18.009
French toast and spaghetti.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.561
You're spoiling me.

11:24.049 --> 11:26.383
You saw mother again.

11:28.687 --> 11:29.771
Yes.

11:29.773 --> 11:32.657
James, when can I
go back to school?

11:32.659 --> 11:36.227
Now I see why I'm getting
the royal treatment.

11:36.229 --> 11:38.429
If I fall too far behind,
I'll never catch up.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.447
Lara...

11:39.449 --> 11:40.564
I promise I'll be careful.

11:40.566 --> 11:42.734
You can drop me off
and pick me up.

11:42.736 --> 11:46.337
Look, we're different
from other people.

11:46.339 --> 11:49.574
I never should have
put you out in the world

11:49.576 --> 11:51.375
to subject you to ridicule.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.594
Ridicule?

11:55.464 --> 12:00.601
Your birth defect is the
first thing that people see.

12:02.104 --> 12:07.141
And people can be
so cruel.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.527
But they're not.

12:09.529 --> 12:12.230
I have friends at school, James.
Good friends.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.765
Then there's pity.

12:13.767 --> 12:16.267
Pity is worse than
ridicule.

12:16.269 --> 12:19.253
These people think
that they're doing you a favor

12:19.255 --> 12:22.623
by being nice to you,
but they have no idea

12:22.625 --> 12:25.293
how special
you truly are.

12:26.979 --> 12:29.464
If you let me go,
I'll call you between every class.

12:29.466 --> 12:30.798
I said no.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.667
Well, at least
let me have a computer.

12:32.669 --> 12:33.951
Not in this house.

12:33.953 --> 12:37.004
How many times
do I have to say it?

12:39.591 --> 12:42.810
Look, if you need
to use a computer,

12:42.812 --> 12:45.462
I can take you
to the library, ok?

12:45.464 --> 12:48.099
But you know that this is for
your own protection.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.433
Right? You know that.

12:49.435 --> 12:53.187
Maybe mother's wrong.

12:54.639 --> 12:58.075
Don't you ever say that.

12:59.912 --> 13:02.864
Mother's plagued with visions that
she'd rather not see,

13:02.866 --> 13:05.649
but for our sake,
I'm glad she does.

13:05.651 --> 13:07.985
You're hurting me.

13:13.992 --> 13:15.659
Is that the next wife?

13:15.661 --> 13:17.044
Yes.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.496
When will you
hunt her down?

13:22.134 --> 13:25.219
When we're finished
with the one that we have now.

13:37.283 --> 13:39.683
Ohh! Ohh!

13:39.685 --> 13:42.570
Ohh! Ohh!

13:51.697 --> 13:53.130
Fount of wisdom.

13:53.132 --> 13:54.380
Penelope, how many patients

13:54.405 --> 13:56.437
were in the female ward
of the asylum?

13:57.053 --> 13:59.487
Uh, 32.
6 died in the fire

13:59.489 --> 14:01.639
that broke out in the kitchen
next to the ward.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.201
The rest were transferred
out of the facility

14:03.226 --> 14:04.711
when the hospital shut down.

14:04.744 --> 14:05.709
Anyone recently released?

14:05.711 --> 14:07.712
The last female patient
that got out

14:07.714 --> 14:09.764
was 5 years ago
when she was 80.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.315
It was a compassionate
release.

14:11.317 --> 14:12.483
Thanks, Garcia.

14:12.485 --> 14:13.734
Hey, guys.

14:13.736 --> 14:16.103
What do you think
about this?

14:16.105 --> 14:18.439
Batty.
That's kind of on the nose.

14:18.441 --> 14:22.660
No, not that. Rick,
can you zoom in right here?

14:22.662 --> 14:25.196
Emma's the name
of the victim.

14:25.198 --> 14:28.232
It could also be completely
unrelated to the case.

14:28.234 --> 14:29.617
What do the numbers
mean?

14:29.619 --> 14:32.086
My guess--patient I.D.s.

14:32.088 --> 14:34.222
Has the paint analysis
come back yet?

14:34.224 --> 14:37.408
Uh, this particular
sample

14:37.410 --> 14:39.510
was written no more than
a week ago.

14:39.512 --> 14:42.129
Check these names against
missing women in Oregon.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.015
Well, if this is
a list of victims,

14:44.017 --> 14:46.601
it means there are more
he hasn't chosen yet.

15:51.649 --> 15:54.368
Is she...

16:05.098 --> 16:07.515
She's one of them.

16:10.268 --> 16:13.337
An innocent will die
before the wise,

16:13.339 --> 16:16.140
but a devil's wife
will surely rise.

16:55.493 --> 16:58.045
Alice Pritchard was 22.

16:58.047 --> 17:00.997
A senior
at Portland College.

17:00.999 --> 17:03.800
She went missing
from campus 5 days ago.

17:03.802 --> 17:06.202
A realtor found her body
here this morning.

17:06.204 --> 17:08.538
I don't see
any physical similarities

17:08.540 --> 17:10.257
to our first victim.

17:10.259 --> 17:12.059
She's a lot smaller
than Emma.

17:12.060 --> 17:14.094
Different coloring,
different age.

17:14.096 --> 17:16.713
So these women aren't
surrogates for anyone.

17:16.714 --> 17:19.398
But he did lay her out
in the same way.

17:19.401 --> 17:21.401
She's displayed in
the center of the room

17:21.403 --> 17:24.671
just like the other victim
at the asylum.

17:24.673 --> 17:27.574
It's as if
she's being presented.

17:28.993 --> 17:32.896
There is so much attention
paid to detail.

17:32.898 --> 17:37.367
This is also satisfying
some internal desire of the unsub.

17:37.369 --> 17:41.237
So, why leave bodies
in an empty storefront

17:41.239 --> 17:42.439
and the asylum?

17:42.441 --> 17:44.407
Good question.

17:45.510 --> 17:50.597
There should be a connection
between the two.

17:52.467 --> 17:57.220
Or maybe it's not about
this storefront at all.

17:57.222 --> 18:00.557
A theater company
performing Shakespeare.

18:00.559 --> 18:02.926
The dress,
the white makeup.

18:02.928 --> 18:06.229
This victim could
literally be wearing a costume.

18:06.231 --> 18:09.265
What if this was the closest
to the theater

18:09.267 --> 18:11.985
that the unsub could get...

18:11.987 --> 18:14.621
Without being caught?

18:19.777 --> 18:22.212
Alice's sorority sisters
say she wanted to be a nurse

18:22.214 --> 18:24.280
and she was active
in a Christian youth group.

18:24.282 --> 18:26.950
If she was into anything dark, her
best friends sure didn't know about it.

18:26.952 --> 18:29.469
She was in Portland
collecting donations for an orphanage

18:29.471 --> 18:31.955
when she disappeared. The unsub
could have approached her on the street.

18:31.957 --> 18:33.790
Hey, baby girl, you're on speaker.

18:33.792 --> 18:35.225
Give me the lowdown.

18:35.227 --> 18:37.227
Chocolate thunder, you can have
the whole kit and caboodle.

18:37.229 --> 18:38.766
Just say the word.
Oh, and I cross-referenced

18:38.791 --> 18:40.034
the names you found on the wall
with missing women

18:40.848 --> 18:43.231
in Oregon and I came up
with some matches.

18:43.301 --> 18:44.434
Christine Torres.

18:44.436 --> 18:46.987
She is a 40-year-old
homemaker from Eugene, Oregon.

18:46.989 --> 18:48.438
She went missing
over a month ago

18:48.440 --> 18:49.823
after she dropped
her kids off at school.

18:49.825 --> 18:51.858
Any other women
named Emma missing?

18:51.860 --> 18:54.611
Uh-uh. Just the one whose body
we found. Same thing with Alice.

18:54.613 --> 18:56.112
Hey, Garcia,
what was the exact date

18:56.114 --> 18:57.747
Christine was
reported missing?

18:57.749 --> 19:00.650
February 28th. Emma went
missing on March 19th,

19:00.652 --> 19:03.003
Alice on the 22nd.

19:03.005 --> 19:05.505
Guys, I think
these numbers are dates.

19:05.507 --> 19:09.176
If you reverse them and chop
off the 11 at the beginning and end...

19:09.178 --> 19:10.877
That's two days after
each woman went missing.

19:10.879 --> 19:12.045
It's more than that,
though. Look.

19:12.047 --> 19:14.130
March first
is Saint Eichatadt day.

19:14.132 --> 19:15.932
March 21st
is the spring equinox,

19:15.934 --> 19:17.884
and the 24th is
the feast of the beast.

19:17.886 --> 19:20.604
All important holidays in the
Satanic calendar for sacrifices.

19:20.606 --> 19:22.222
What about the 11
on the end?

19:22.224 --> 19:24.007
To many occultists
11 is symbolic of Lucifer.

19:24.009 --> 19:26.610
Ok, I thought we were moving
away from the satanic killings.

19:26.612 --> 19:28.028
Apparently we need
to reconsider.

19:28.030 --> 19:30.146
There's gotta be some sort of
connection to the devil here.

19:30.148 --> 19:32.065
Reid, what other upcoming dates
are significant to satanists?

19:32.067 --> 19:33.400
Good Friday,
then Easter Eve.

19:33.402 --> 19:34.951
Then preparations
begin in mid-April

19:34.953 --> 19:35.738
for the most important
holiday of all--

19:35.763 --> 19:37.254
Walpurgis Night on April 30th.

19:37.411 --> 19:38.577
Good Friday's in two days.

19:38.579 --> 19:40.491
That means he's hunting
for his next victim today.

19:41.043 --> 19:43.043
We need to give
the profile soon.

19:50.701 --> 19:51.918
Hi!

19:51.920 --> 19:53.703
Hi yourself.

19:53.705 --> 19:55.005
How are you feeling?

19:55.007 --> 19:56.907
Better.
Thanks for asking.

19:56.909 --> 19:59.009
Are you contagious?

19:59.011 --> 20:00.710
Gosh, no, not at all.

20:00.712 --> 20:01.928
Cool.

20:01.930 --> 20:03.980
So, remember how
you sponsored me

20:03.982 --> 20:05.782
for the spring walk-a-thon,

20:05.784 --> 20:07.651
$5.00 a mile.

20:07.653 --> 20:09.219
You owe me 50 bucks.

20:09.221 --> 20:11.771
Oh, right.
Let me get it.

20:15.392 --> 20:17.744
Is everyone still going
Saturday?

20:17.746 --> 20:20.530
I know you like Henry,
but you can forget about him,

20:20.532 --> 20:22.799
because he's taking
Stacy to the prom.

20:22.801 --> 20:24.000
Really?

20:24.002 --> 20:25.735
Yeah.

20:26.871 --> 20:29.522
Is this your mom?

20:29.524 --> 20:32.342
I thought you were sleeping.

20:32.344 --> 20:35.262
This is my friend Chloe
from school.

20:35.264 --> 20:37.080
This is my brother James.

20:37.082 --> 20:39.015
Hi. It's nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about--

20:39.017 --> 20:41.134
- It's time for you to go.
- James--

20:41.136 --> 20:43.186
But I was hoping that Lara
could come out on Saturday

20:43.188 --> 20:44.271
because that's when
the prom is--

20:45.257 --> 20:47.707
Why did you do that?
Did you invite her?

20:47.709 --> 20:48.925
No, she came on her own.

20:48.927 --> 20:50.060
She's not your friend.

20:50.062 --> 20:52.646
Yes, she is. She wanted
to see how I was doing.

20:52.648 --> 20:55.598
If I was still
going to prom on Saturday.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.867
I don't have a date
or anything.

20:57.869 --> 21:00.370
A bunch of us
are going as a group.

21:00.372 --> 21:01.972
So can I go?

21:01.974 --> 21:03.373
Absolutely not.

21:03.375 --> 21:07.160
I only get one prom
in my life,

21:07.162 --> 21:09.245
and you're gonna
deprive me of it?

21:09.247 --> 21:11.965
Please?

21:11.967 --> 21:14.301
I love you, James.

21:14.303 --> 21:17.804
You're the best brother
in the whole world.

21:17.806 --> 21:23.259
Your love is a mere shadow
compared to mine.

21:23.261 --> 21:26.146
And I would die for you.

21:26.148 --> 21:28.648
Is that what you want?

21:29.483 --> 21:31.768
No.

21:31.770 --> 21:34.487
Then don't invite
unnecessary danger?

21:36.473 --> 21:39.476
I can't stay
in this prison forever.

21:40.828 --> 21:42.679
You speak like a green girl,

21:42.681 --> 21:44.364
unsifted in such perilous
circumstances.

21:44.366 --> 21:46.416
All right,
let's do it again.

21:46.418 --> 21:47.867
It's right this way.

21:49.120 --> 21:52.539
The gowns in the photos
look familiar.

21:52.541 --> 21:54.490
Let's see here.

21:57.011 --> 21:59.162
Oh, here.

21:59.164 --> 22:01.848
From "The Merry Wives
of Windsor."

22:03.667 --> 22:06.269
This fabric is the same.

22:06.271 --> 22:09.856
Oh, and here's the other one
from the same play.

22:09.858 --> 22:11.891
They're practically
identical.

22:11.893 --> 22:13.393
Are any costumes
missing?

22:13.395 --> 22:16.446
Oh, no. I just did
an inventory on Monday,

22:16.448 --> 22:18.948
and we don't have
duplicates of these gowns.

22:18.950 --> 22:20.683
When was the last time
the theater performed

22:20.685 --> 22:22.535
"The Merry Wives
of Windsor"?

22:22.537 --> 22:23.987
Well, let's see here.

22:23.989 --> 22:25.655
Oh, last fall.

22:25.657 --> 22:28.458
And they haven't been
used for anything else

22:28.460 --> 22:30.410
or it would be marked
on the label.

22:30.412 --> 22:31.961
Maybe somebody
in the audience saw it

22:31.963 --> 22:33.546
and made copies
of the gowns.

22:33.548 --> 22:35.287
But the level of detail
suggests someone

22:35.312 --> 22:36.802
up close and personal.

22:37.302 --> 22:40.303
We'll need a list of everyone
involved in the production.

22:42.306 --> 22:44.707
Lara is beginning
to question our mission.

22:44.709 --> 22:46.359
I can't control her anymore.

22:46.361 --> 22:50.046
She's 16, which means
she's at a vulnerable stage.

22:50.048 --> 22:52.348
The devil will take
notice of her now.

22:52.350 --> 22:53.850
What do I do?

22:53.852 --> 22:55.852
My poor noble James.

22:55.854 --> 22:57.654
You'll have to
strike first

22:57.656 --> 23:00.356
if you want to save
those you love.

23:14.839 --> 23:17.791
Based on the dresses and makeup
the victims were found in,

23:17.793 --> 23:19.190
we're looking for an unsub
who is living in

23:19.215 --> 23:20.971
an elaborate fantasy world.

23:21.346 --> 23:25.414
He believes he is special, perhaps
acting on behalf of the devil.

23:25.416 --> 23:27.100
This unsub tortured
his victims

23:27.102 --> 23:28.802
by submerging them
in water for days

23:28.804 --> 23:30.470
before killing them.

23:30.472 --> 23:33.089
Which means he's deliberate
and patient.

23:33.091 --> 23:35.024
This guy has
a vivid imagination.

23:35.026 --> 23:37.777
The costumes and makeup
suggest that he's a history buff,

23:37.779 --> 23:39.362
or he may be a fan
of Shakespeare.

23:39.364 --> 23:42.315
Using nicotine as
a poison is highly unusual,

23:42.317 --> 23:43.599
so he's either
very well-read

23:43.601 --> 23:45.151
or under the guidance
of another.

23:45.153 --> 23:46.619
His interests and delusions

23:46.621 --> 23:48.738
have caused him
to become isolated socially.

23:48.740 --> 23:51.291
He can appear normal
to his potential targets,

23:51.293 --> 23:53.743
and his crimes are not
driven by sex or greed,

23:53.745 --> 23:56.463
but instead by his
delusional belief system.

23:56.465 --> 23:59.165
Although the bodies of only
two victims have been recovered,

23:59.167 --> 24:01.784
there's likely a third,
specifically Christine Torres,

24:01.786 --> 24:03.303
who disappeared in February.

24:03.305 --> 24:05.672
This unsub's exact age
is difficult to determine,

24:05.674 --> 24:07.891
but he's probably
in his 20s to 30s.

24:07.893 --> 24:11.261
The fact that he travels
so far to abduct his victims

24:11.263 --> 24:14.447
indicates that he has a very
specific selection criteria.

24:14.449 --> 24:16.766
This unsub has a female
or underage accomplice

24:16.768 --> 24:18.935
to sew the dresses
the victims were found in,

24:18.937 --> 24:21.470
but she may not be a partner
in the traditional sense.

24:21.472 --> 24:23.740
It's quite possible
she was coerced into helping

24:23.742 --> 24:26.109
and may actually
be a victim herself.

24:26.111 --> 24:27.675
Most importantly, this unsub
is working according to

24:27.676 --> 24:30.849
a specific timetable that
corresponds with the satanic calendar,

24:30.916 --> 24:34.784
and he has plans to kidnap another
victim before the end of today.

24:34.786 --> 24:36.152
Thank you.

24:46.463 --> 24:48.664
Ok. Thanks.

24:48.666 --> 24:51.184
So, Garcia checked out
everyone associated

24:51.186 --> 24:52.635
with that theater production

24:52.637 --> 24:55.438
of "The Merry Wives of Windsor."
They're all in the clear.

24:55.440 --> 24:57.857
Well, the gowns have to be
connected to the theater somehow.

24:57.859 --> 24:59.275
It can't just be
a coincidence.

24:59.277 --> 25:01.528
There's something else
that's been bothering me.

25:01.530 --> 25:04.013
Why is he putting white face makeup
on his victims after they're dead?

25:04.015 --> 25:06.115
Isn't that what they wore
in the Elizabethan era?

25:06.117 --> 25:08.568
Yes, but only upper-class
women wore white face makeup.

25:08.570 --> 25:10.453
It was a symbol
of virginity and purity.

25:10.455 --> 25:12.037
But he's dressing them
like characters out of

25:12.062 --> 25:13.262
"The Merry Wives of Windsor,"

25:13.408 --> 25:14.656
which is one of
Shakespeare's rare plays

25:14.681 --> 25:16.034
about the middle class.

25:16.628 --> 25:18.194
So it's inconsistent.

25:18.196 --> 25:20.496
The makeup could mean that he
believes death is purifying them.

25:20.498 --> 25:22.081
What if this is like
the Salem witch trials,

25:22.083 --> 25:24.250
where they test the girls
by trying to drown them?

25:24.252 --> 25:25.885
If they died, it meant
they were obviously innocent.

25:25.887 --> 25:26.876
If they somehow survived,

25:26.901 --> 25:28.841
they were considered witches
and therefore hanged.

25:29.391 --> 25:31.874
Wonderful.
A lose-lose situation.

25:31.876 --> 25:34.710
But the unsub didn't submerge
the victims in water to torture them.

25:34.712 --> 25:36.346
It was some sort of a test?

25:36.348 --> 25:38.714
With death being the only
possible outcome.

25:38.716 --> 25:40.433
If he believes
he's killing witches,

25:40.435 --> 25:42.435
he probably thinks
that he's a vigilante

25:42.437 --> 25:45.054
or a protector
against evil of some sort.

25:45.056 --> 25:47.941
Laying the victims out the way he
did could be a message to the devil.

25:47.943 --> 25:49.892
A symbol of victory
and a warning,

25:49.894 --> 25:51.728
like putting a head
on a spike.

25:51.730 --> 25:53.696
He's not worshiping the devil.

25:53.698 --> 25:56.032
He's trying to fight him.

26:03.757 --> 26:06.593
Can I get a Heineken?

26:10.848 --> 26:14.517
Only the finest wine
should pass your lips.

26:18.255 --> 26:20.690
So what is that,
your best line?

26:22.943 --> 26:27.230
I've been watching you
for the last hour.

26:28.598 --> 26:32.452
And you are the most
ravishing creature

26:32.454 --> 26:35.655
that I have ever seen.

26:59.625 --> 27:02.402
The missing woman
is Sarah Gammon,

27:02.404 --> 27:04.738
27-year-old graphic artist.

27:04.740 --> 27:06.924
Her father drove
to her apartment this morning

27:06.926 --> 27:09.009
to pick her up for their
weekly breakfast together.

27:09.011 --> 27:10.444
She wasn't there.

27:10.446 --> 27:11.679
Where was she last seen?

27:11.681 --> 27:14.248
At a night club in Portland,
the, uh, Mirage Room.

27:14.250 --> 27:16.350
She went with a girlfriend
who had to leave early.

27:16.352 --> 27:17.885
Morgan and I
will check it out.

27:19.522 --> 27:21.722
Ok, I did some varsity-level
sleuthing,

27:21.724 --> 27:23.607
and it turns out
the costumes were donated

27:23.609 --> 27:27.194
to the theater by a young actress
named Cate Harris.

27:27.196 --> 27:29.647
She was in their production of "The
Merry Wives of Windsor" 16 years ago,

27:29.649 --> 27:31.599
which was the only other time
that play was produced there.

27:31.601 --> 27:33.400
Where is she now?

27:33.402 --> 27:35.769
Oh, I was hoping you would ask,
because I have the answer.

27:35.771 --> 27:40.207
She died in 1998 in the fire at
St. Baldwin's Psychiatric Hospital.

27:40.209 --> 27:41.542
Was she a patient there?

27:41.544 --> 27:43.544
Oh, most definitely. And some
say that she set that fire.

27:43.546 --> 27:45.612
Garcia, can you get
her medical records?

27:45.614 --> 27:47.614
Yeah, I tried to do that,
but it turns out

27:47.616 --> 27:49.333
the new director
of St. Baldwin's

27:49.335 --> 27:51.835
was a technophobe
hyper-luddite like our Dr. Reid,

27:51.837 --> 27:54.421
and he only wanted
the psych records to be on paper

27:54.423 --> 27:55.673
to protect confidentiality.

27:55.675 --> 27:59.093
Ok. Detective, we need you to get
a copy of those records.

27:59.095 --> 28:00.261

28:52.397 --> 28:56.817
I spoke to mother again.
She said that the end is near.

28:56.819 --> 28:59.103
She did?

28:59.105 --> 29:02.022
You see, there's only...

29:02.024 --> 29:06.377
one more of the devil's brides
left and we have her.

29:06.379 --> 29:09.546
When she's dead,
we'll be safe.

29:09.548 --> 29:11.865
I can go to school again?

29:11.867 --> 29:15.035
The family will be free,

29:15.037 --> 29:19.423

So, did she like this guy
that was hitting on her?

30:47.563 --> 30:49.963
Oh, yeah.
No offense to her,

30:49.965 --> 30:52.349
but she wouldn't normally
get that sort of attention.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.268
I mean, this was
a handsome, rich dude.

30:54.270 --> 30:55.853
He could have had
his pick of the lot,

30:55.855 --> 30:57.171
but he was fixated
on her.

30:57.173 --> 30:58.138
How so?

30:58.140 --> 31:00.407
I saw him.
A couple of knockouts

31:00.409 --> 31:01.657
tried talking to him,
but he blew them off.

31:02.077 --> 31:03.494
Here, take a look.

31:05.092 --> 31:06.392
She's the blonde.

31:06.449 --> 31:07.748
And that's him.

31:07.750 --> 31:09.199
He's following her.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.118
How long before
he talked to her?

31:11.120 --> 31:13.704
I think it was about an hour.

31:13.706 --> 31:15.789
Excuse me.

31:15.791 --> 31:17.124
Hey, what's up?

31:17.126 --> 31:19.376
Well, there's no doubt
she's the one he wanted.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.762
I agree. His choice
wasn't random.

31:21.764 --> 31:23.497
It's like he knew
she was gonna be there

31:23.499 --> 31:24.998
and he went there
looking for her.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.601
But why these particular women?
They have nothing in common.

31:27.603 --> 31:32.873
What if each victim
has to look a certain way?

31:32.875 --> 31:34.608
He'd want to find
a real-life match,

31:34.610 --> 31:37.227
and he'd be willing
to travel to get to her.

31:57.549 --> 32:00.334
Why isn't she moving?

32:01.702 --> 32:04.421
Is she dead?

32:05.890 --> 32:09.376
No. No, no, no.

32:11.262 --> 32:13.147
She can't be.

32:16.017 --> 32:18.352
Oh, my God,
she was innocent.

32:18.354 --> 32:21.388
You killed an innocent woman.

32:21.390 --> 32:23.557
It's a trick.

32:23.559 --> 32:25.892
She's dead, James.

32:25.894 --> 32:28.061
You were wrong.

32:28.063 --> 32:30.080
I'm calling the police.

32:31.699 --> 32:34.535
No! No!

32:38.906 --> 32:40.207
I'm sorry.

32:40.209 --> 32:43.243
Ok?

32:43.245 --> 32:47.414
I'm sorry, but we have to find
the last of the devil's wives.

32:48.766 --> 32:52.402
There's never gonna be
a last one, is there?

32:52.404 --> 32:55.755
This'll go on
forever and ever.

33:01.062 --> 33:03.216
Apparently the state
would have to pay

33:03.238 --> 33:06.282
for a new storage facility
if they moved the records.

33:06.535 --> 33:09.820
Someone decided, why bother
if the old place works?

33:11.072 --> 33:13.106
Ladies.

33:16.110 --> 33:18.579
No electricity, I take it.

33:18.581 --> 33:20.797
You would be correct.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.989
Hey. I think I found it.

33:45.991 --> 33:47.641
Yeah. Oh. First of all,

33:47.643 --> 33:51.995
Cate Harris was a stage name
for Catherine Heathridge,

33:51.997 --> 33:53.247
a textile heiress.

33:53.249 --> 33:55.198
Her family kept
the pseudonym

33:55.200 --> 33:57.084
for her medical admission
to protect their privacy.

33:57.086 --> 33:58.869
According to
the intake report,

33:58.871 --> 34:01.328
Catherine was an aspiring
actress who went off her

34:01.353 --> 34:02.553
psychiatric medications

34:02.625 --> 34:04.291
when she was pregnant
with her daughter.

34:04.293 --> 34:06.951
She had a minor part in
"The Merry Wives of Windsor"

34:06.976 --> 34:10.368
16 years ago when she became
floridly psychotic.

34:10.799 --> 34:13.433
She was convinced the other
actresses were the devil's wives,

34:13.435 --> 34:15.135
so she stabbed one of them.

34:15.137 --> 34:16.835
Is that when
she was admitted here?

34:16.838 --> 34:19.690
Not yet. It seems she had a son
and a daughter.

34:19.692 --> 34:21.007
After fleeing
the theater,

34:21.009 --> 34:24.010
she chopped off the left arm
of her infant daughter.

34:24.012 --> 34:26.112
Why would she do that?

34:26.114 --> 34:29.315
To make the child
less appealing to the devil.

34:29.318 --> 34:31.504
She believed that
killing the devil's wives

34:31.529 --> 34:32.536
was her mission on earth,

34:32.538 --> 34:34.788
which is what
our unsub is doing now.

34:34.790 --> 34:36.857
But she died
in the asylum fire.

34:36.859 --> 34:40.043
Someone else must be
carrying out her mission.

34:48.252 --> 34:51.705
I murdered an innocent.

34:51.706 --> 34:55.342
Even white knights
have their dark days.

34:55.344 --> 34:58.111
You're a vanishing breed,
James.

34:58.113 --> 35:02.749
My son, a hero
from a different time.

35:02.751 --> 35:05.769
Only one wife remains.
I'm sure of it.

35:05.771 --> 35:07.887
If you don't kill her,
who will?

35:07.889 --> 35:09.740
No one.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.909
Kill her.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.900
Kill her.

36:00.025 --> 36:02.011
If someone's carrying on
in Catherine's mission,

36:02.012 --> 36:04.646
then it's quite possible they
both suffer from folie a deux,

36:04.648 --> 36:06.419
a shared psychotic disorder
between two people

36:06.444 --> 36:07.876
who are extremely close,
and that would mean

36:07.878 --> 36:09.613
it's most likely
a family member.

36:09.653 --> 36:10.853
Maybe one or both
of her kids.

36:10.855 --> 36:12.856
Garcia, I need you to find
everything you can

36:12.857 --> 36:14.004
on the Heathridge family,

36:14.029 --> 36:15.640
specifically Catherine's
son and daughter.

36:15.642 --> 36:18.610
Ok, finding it
as we speak.

36:18.612 --> 36:21.547
Bingo. Catherine,
a wealthy textile heiress,

36:21.549 --> 36:24.650
had a son James, now 26,

36:24.652 --> 36:26.568
and a daughter Lara,
now 16.

36:26.570 --> 36:29.654
Father died in a speedboat
accident right before Lara was born.

36:29.656 --> 36:31.006
They were raised by
their grandfather

36:31.008 --> 36:33.292
in a mansion outside Portland
after mom was committed.

36:33.294 --> 36:35.043
Is the grandfather
still alive?

36:35.045 --> 36:36.628
No. He died last year.

36:36.630 --> 36:37.713
That could have been
the stressor.

36:37.715 --> 36:39.181
Garcia, where are the kids
living now?

36:39.183 --> 36:42.601
James was kicked out of a seminary
in Colorado 3 years ago,

36:42.603 --> 36:45.003
but that's still listed
as his address.

36:45.005 --> 36:47.672
Lara dropped out of school
6 weeks ago,

36:47.674 --> 36:50.108
coincidentally
on her birthday.

36:50.110 --> 36:51.727
And the family home
is her listed address,

36:51.729 --> 36:55.063
and I'm sending you pictures
right...Now.

36:56.816 --> 36:58.683
That could be him.

36:58.685 --> 37:00.852
The man at the night club
who left with Sarah Gammon.

37:00.854 --> 37:02.537
All right,
contact the seminary.

37:02.539 --> 37:04.323
Garcia, I'm gonna need
an address.

37:18.638 --> 37:20.339
What's wrong?

37:25.878 --> 37:28.713
I swear I'm not one of them.
Please don't do this.

37:28.715 --> 37:30.548
I'm going to save you.

37:30.550 --> 37:32.818
I'll die, James.
You know I will.

37:32.820 --> 37:36.355
Not if I murder the devil first.
Let's go.

37:40.410 --> 37:42.411
He'll see you

37:42.413 --> 37:44.446
and he'll come for you.

37:45.615 --> 37:47.749
And when he does,
I'll strike.

37:47.751 --> 37:49.901
What if you fail?

37:51.671 --> 37:54.439
Then we'll die together.

38:29.208 --> 38:31.695
Morgan, you and JJ
take the back.

38:31.720 --> 38:33.120
We'll take the front.

38:33.163 --> 38:35.714
Did you see that?
There's a girl up in that window.

38:38.084 --> 38:41.453
You check it out.
I'll look for James.

40:04.170 --> 40:05.854
Damn.

40:07.373 --> 40:10.809
It looks like we just found
our first victim.

40:28.277 --> 40:30.579
Ok.

40:32.615 --> 40:34.899
Ok.

40:34.901 --> 40:38.236
Ok, I'm gonna get this
off you, ok? Hold on.

41:15.291 --> 41:17.275
Uh! Uhh!

41:22.115 --> 41:23.615
Ok. Ok.

41:23.617 --> 41:25.250
Where is James?

41:35.928 --> 41:40.065
Aah!

41:52.111 --> 41:56.814
"All that we see or seem
is but a dream within a dream."

41:56.816 --> 41:59.417
Edgar Allan Poe.

41:59.419 --> 42:01.836
So, Lara is gonna be ok.

42:01.838 --> 42:04.481
She confirmed that
the bodies were left out

42:04.506 --> 42:05.758
as messages to the devil.

42:05.825 --> 42:07.676
Well, her brother's dead.
What happens to her now?

42:07.678 --> 42:08.843
There's always
foster care.

42:08.845 --> 42:11.663
For an heiress?
I don't think so.

42:11.665 --> 42:13.744
I'm sure guardians
and trustees will be

42:13.769 --> 42:14.969
coming out of the woodwork.

42:15.001 --> 42:16.768
So she'll end up
back here,

42:16.770 --> 42:19.471
in a house that
breeds delusions.

42:19.473 --> 42:22.023
Hopefully not.

42:43.297 --> 42:45.213
I'll get it.

43:05.101 --> 43:09.237
I've waited so long
for you, Lara.

43:10.556 --> 43:13.074
It's time to come
with me now.

43:17.780 --> 43:21.082

in Your Eyes" plays]
