00:08.138 --> 00:11.272
<i>Previously on</i>SWAT...

00:11.315 --> 00:13.230
<i>She's having
the same nightmares again.</i>

00:13.274 --> 00:14.362
Ever since
our house got shot up, I...

00:14.405 --> 00:15.363
What are we supposed to do?

00:15.406 --> 00:16.146
I booked a session

00:16.190 --> 00:17.539
tomorrow with Dr. Collins.

00:17.582 --> 00:18.975
For the last few months,
I've been working

00:19.019 --> 00:20.585
with Agent Carr
in the FBI's

00:20.629 --> 00:22.283
counterterrorism division
to monitor a new crop

00:22.326 --> 00:24.067
of white supremacist groups
popping up in L.A.

00:24.111 --> 00:26.461
Hate crimes have been on
the upswing the last few years.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.550
We're trying to get ahead
of their darker urges.

00:28.593 --> 00:31.205
Great job at the shoot house.Thanks, Erica. It's nice

00:31.248 --> 00:33.642
seeing you in a SWAT uniform.
Learn everything you can,

00:33.685 --> 00:35.557
and you'll move up the ranks.How'd you do it?

00:35.600 --> 00:38.212
I look for every opportunity,
like the TLI liaison thing.

00:38.255 --> 00:39.822
Tan's got one more cadre
than me.

00:39.865 --> 00:42.259
Street's been central
to huge undercover ops.

00:42.303 --> 00:45.349
I should have beat him. When I
first met Street, he was the guy

00:45.393 --> 00:47.308
with the crazy mom
who then got kicked out of SWAT

00:47.351 --> 00:48.570
and barely made it back.

00:48.613 --> 00:50.354
Now he's got it
all figured out,

00:50.398 --> 00:52.400
and I'm in my 30s and still
living in my uncle's garage.

00:52.443 --> 00:53.923
I've been looking around

00:53.966 --> 00:55.272
for a new place.

00:55.316 --> 00:56.708
Might be able
to lock down something swanky

00:56.752 --> 00:58.232
with a roommate to share costs.

00:58.275 --> 01:00.799
So, what do you say?

01:00.843 --> 01:03.846
Are you kidding? Hell yeah!Oh, great.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.501
Breaking news.

01:06.544 --> 01:09.069
LAPD officers are in pursuit
of an armed suspect

01:09.112 --> 01:11.201
who reportedly just robbed
a gas station,

01:11.245 --> 01:12.898
shooting and killing the owner.

01:12.942 --> 01:14.726
The suspect has continued
to fire on police

01:14.770 --> 01:16.250
during the wild pursuit.

01:16.293 --> 01:19.079
But now it looks like
they have him pinned in.

01:26.651 --> 01:28.349
Suspect
exited the vehicle,

01:28.392 --> 01:30.699
is heading into the quarry!
In foot pursuit!

01:30.742 --> 01:32.396
I'm a minute out. Stay on him.

01:49.718 --> 01:51.807
I see him!

01:54.897 --> 01:56.899
He's on the pallets.

02:01.512 --> 02:03.253
He jumped over to the east side.
We got to go around.

02:03.297 --> 02:04.559
Suspect jumped
over the east side of the wall.

02:04.602 --> 02:06.213
We lost visual.
We need eyes in the sky.

02:06.256 --> 02:07.518
Air 3. Suspect spotted.

02:07.562 --> 02:09.346
He's heading
for the main building.

02:22.054 --> 02:23.621
[clattering overhead]Up there!

02:24.666 --> 02:26.320
Chris, Tan, take the stairs.
Go. Street,

02:26.363 --> 02:27.886
we'll take the exits.
Let's lock him down.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.371
Police! Stop!

02:35.851 --> 02:37.853
Split. I'll take the ladder,
cut him off on the right.

02:37.896 --> 02:38.941
Take the left.

02:54.696 --> 02:57.177
Suspect is heading outside
on the conveyor belt.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.416
He's on an ATV headed north!

03:19.460 --> 03:21.462
Roger that.

03:22.550 --> 03:24.552
<i>Hondo, he's trying to slip us.</i>

03:26.510 --> 03:28.295
I'm on him.

03:32.473 --> 03:34.257
I can't get a safe shot
at the tires.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.433
I'm gonna give Hondo
some backup.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.509
Hondo, I'm in the Tahoe.
Where do you want me?

04:13.253 --> 04:14.341
Deac, we're coming back.
Help me

04:14.384 --> 04:15.777
cut him off,
and we'll pin him in.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.320
<i>Airship 3,</i>

04:37.364 --> 04:39.235
I need you to hover low enough
to kick up a dust cloud.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.410
Copy that.

04:54.598 --> 04:57.688
You're under arrest.

04:58.559 --> 05:00.169
You the one that took him down?

05:00.212 --> 05:01.953
Nah, I can't take credit,
Durham. Hondo got him.

05:01.997 --> 05:03.781
Guy was like the Road Runner.

05:03.825 --> 05:05.827
Except the Road Runner
never got caught.

05:05.870 --> 05:07.132
Well, this shift
is officially over.

05:07.176 --> 05:08.917
I think we all
deserve a cold beer.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.919
I got sand in places

05:10.962 --> 05:12.616
you do not want sand.
Shower first, then beer?

05:12.660 --> 05:15.315
I can't. Erika and I still have
some unpacking to do.

05:15.358 --> 05:17.186
How's the apartment?Sweet. On-site gym.

05:17.229 --> 05:19.144
Rooftop pool.
What's not to love?

05:19.188 --> 05:20.232
Mm.You're coming to the
housewarming, right?

05:20.276 --> 05:21.799
Yeah, no doubt.

05:21.843 --> 05:23.235
Street wants to know
if he can bring his floatie.

05:23.279 --> 05:24.672
It's an Inflatabull.

05:24.715 --> 05:25.803
Figured we could have

05:25.847 --> 05:27.152
a little rodeo contest.

05:27.196 --> 05:29.154
What? You know you want
to be rodeo queen.

05:29.198 --> 05:31.200
Hey, Hondo, you got someone
to cover for me tomorrow?

05:31.243 --> 05:32.897
I haven't checked out
the roster yet.

05:32.941 --> 05:34.203
Wait. Are you not
riding with us?

05:34.246 --> 05:35.596
Yeah. I got
to take the day off.

05:35.639 --> 05:37.032
Family business
per the wife.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.163
This the private school tour?

05:38.207 --> 05:39.948
What's wrong with
public school?

05:39.991 --> 05:42.080
Erika could cover for you.

05:42.124 --> 05:44.126
Rocker's team has tomorrow off.
She'd be down for it.

05:44.169 --> 05:45.954
If she wants in, Chris,
I'll clear it with Hicks.

05:45.997 --> 05:48.826
Armed robbery in progress
at Osborne and Grant.

05:48.870 --> 05:50.915
When it rains,
Our shift's over,

05:50.959 --> 05:53.265
but that's pretty
close to here.

05:53.309 --> 05:55.920
Let's roll.

06:02.623 --> 06:05.321
25-David. Arrived at location.
Building's on fire.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.497
Deacon, Chris,
check the three side.

06:07.541 --> 06:09.412
Anyone inside?Fire department's on its way.

06:09.456 --> 06:12.502
Tan, keep everyone back.LAPD! Let's go. Back up.

06:12.546 --> 06:13.851
Back up. Let's go.

06:14.896 --> 06:17.333
I see someone.
I'm grabbing the Halligan.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.603
Go, go, go, go.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.954
I got you.I got shot in my leg.

06:29.998 --> 06:31.521
Can you stand?I'll try.

06:31.565 --> 06:33.175
Come on.

06:48.190 --> 06:49.539
End of shift now, right?

07:28.796 --> 07:30.711
RHD pulled security
camera footage

07:30.754 --> 07:32.364
from the convenience
store robbery yesterday.

07:32.408 --> 07:33.931
They I.D. the shooter,
need us to bring him in?

07:33.975 --> 07:36.325
Not yet, but
check this out.

07:36.368 --> 07:40.242
Give me the money.
Let's go. Come on.

07:50.861 --> 07:53.777
The guy I arrested yesterday
was wearing the same kind

07:53.821 --> 07:55.126
of bandana.Exactly.

07:55.170 --> 07:57.085
Same bandana, different creep.

07:57.128 --> 07:59.000
The guy you busted
is named Christopher May.

07:59.043 --> 08:00.915
There's no priors, so we
don't know much about him.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.351
But look at this.

08:02.394 --> 08:03.787
The two robberies are linked?

08:03.831 --> 08:05.441
There's been a spate
of armed robberies

08:05.485 --> 08:07.574
and arsons the past few days.

08:07.617 --> 08:10.925
Bodega, Indian supermarket,
two Chinese restaurants.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.883
So far, there's three dead.

08:12.927 --> 08:15.538
Two other victims are in the
hospital in critical condition.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.453
The attacks are all against
minority-owned businesses?

08:17.497 --> 08:18.933
The owner
of the convenience store--

08:18.976 --> 08:20.282
wasn't he a Filipino immigrant?

08:20.325 --> 08:21.849
Yeah, and the
gas station owner

08:21.892 --> 08:23.198
who was killed yesterday
was Asian American.

08:23.241 --> 08:24.721
Well, witness reports
for the bodega

08:24.765 --> 08:26.027
and the supermarket
robberies say

08:26.070 --> 08:27.681
the suspects were white,

08:27.724 --> 08:29.639
and they were also wearing
American flag bandanas.

08:29.683 --> 08:30.901
Both robberies happened
around the same time

08:30.945 --> 08:32.512
we were chasing down May.

08:32.555 --> 08:34.078
So there's other suspects
out there.

08:34.122 --> 08:35.689
Yeah, but these aren't just
run-of-the-mill smash-and-grabs

08:35.732 --> 08:37.038
like we were thinking.

08:37.081 --> 08:38.561
No, they're coordinated
hate crimes.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.041
I've already called
Agent Carr.

08:40.084 --> 08:41.738
You think this is
the white supremacist group

08:41.782 --> 08:43.261
she's been chasing?What were they called?

08:43.305 --> 08:44.741
The Imperial Dukes.

08:44.785 --> 08:47.875
Yeah. That's my worry.

08:51.966 --> 08:53.924
RHD said he clammed up
like a bad oyster

08:53.968 --> 08:55.665
when they tried
interviewing him.

08:55.709 --> 08:57.275
Oh, shame.
I was really looking forward

08:57.319 --> 08:58.886
to hearing his views
on race relations.Hmm.

08:58.929 --> 09:01.323
I hear ya.You think his, uh,
buddies watched you

09:01.366 --> 09:03.020
take his ass down
on live TV yesterday?

09:03.064 --> 09:04.892
Wonder what they
think of him now.

09:04.935 --> 09:07.677
You were looking at armed
robbery and a homicide charge.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.374
That's a life sentence
right there.

09:09.418 --> 09:11.986
But now we know it wasn't
any old robbery-homicide.

09:12.029 --> 09:13.901
It was a premeditated
hate crime,

09:13.944 --> 09:16.730
which means a
federal charge,

09:16.773 --> 09:19.776
supermax prison.

09:19.820 --> 09:23.824
Come on. You're not gonna let us
hear how smart you are?

09:23.867 --> 09:26.130
Not even just one word?

09:26.957 --> 09:29.003
I don't have one word for you.

09:29.046 --> 09:31.048
I got 14.

09:33.485 --> 09:36.358
An Iron Cross.

09:36.401 --> 09:39.013
Subtle.You won't replace us.

09:39.056 --> 09:42.494
And very soon, you're gonna see
what happens when you try.

09:49.763 --> 09:52.069
14 words. White
supremacist slogan.

09:52.113 --> 09:53.897
And the Iron Cross
is a Nazi symbol.

09:53.941 --> 09:55.682
Guess we know who we're
dealing with at least.

09:55.725 --> 09:58.206
But not <i>what
we're dealing with.</i>

09:58.249 --> 10:00.904
Got that buzzy feeling
in my stomach

10:00.948 --> 10:02.514
like first-day-of-school
butterflies.

10:02.558 --> 10:04.734
You're already playing
in the big leagues.

10:04.778 --> 10:06.040
You're just switching
teams for the day.

10:06.083 --> 10:07.519
Nothing to be nervous about.

10:07.563 --> 10:09.043
Took me a few weeks
to get in the rhythm

10:09.086 --> 10:10.305
of Rocker's team.

10:10.348 --> 10:12.133
Don't want to mess up
my chance to impress.

10:12.176 --> 10:14.048
You won't. By the way, what
happened to that guy last night?

10:14.091 --> 10:16.441
The Michael B. Jordan
look-alike you were chatting up

10:16.485 --> 10:18.052
at the, uh, restaurant.

10:18.095 --> 10:21.708
What? You got his number?

10:21.751 --> 10:23.840
Did you go home with him?

10:26.277 --> 10:28.018
Judging by that grin,
I'm guessing you had fun.

10:28.062 --> 10:29.629
Yeah.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.195
He even made me breakfast
in bed.

10:31.239 --> 10:34.024
He's a chef at this fancy
restaurant with a Michelin star.

10:34.068 --> 10:36.331
Makes a killer eggs Benedict.

10:36.374 --> 10:38.376
Didn't you guys go
to Bootie's last night?

10:39.464 --> 10:43.033
You know that place is
a badge bunny hangout, right?

10:43.077 --> 10:44.295
Guys can't be badge bunnies.
That's not a thing.

10:44.339 --> 10:45.688
Are you kidding me?
It's totally a thing.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.516
There are a lot of dudes

10:47.559 --> 10:49.257
who find women in uniform
very sexy.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.693
He was not a badge bunny.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.001
If you say so.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.917
<i>We have</i>

10:56.960 --> 10:58.701
a state-of-the-art
robotics lab,

10:58.745 --> 11:00.311
three science labs,

11:00.355 --> 11:03.140
an Olympic-sized swimming pool,
two libraries...

11:03.184 --> 11:04.707
Do you offer Mandarin?

11:04.751 --> 11:05.752
We do, as well as

11:05.795 --> 11:08.755
Japanese, French, Spanish,

11:08.798 --> 11:10.147
ancient Greek and Latin.

11:10.191 --> 11:11.148
Ancient Greek?

11:11.192 --> 11:12.323
Well, that's useful.

11:12.367 --> 11:13.585
We also have an
organic juice bar

11:13.629 --> 11:15.413
and coffee cart on campus.

11:15.457 --> 11:16.676
Ah, what a relief.

11:16.719 --> 11:18.155
Wasn't sure how Lila
was gonna cope

11:18.199 --> 11:19.374
without her double-shot
macchiato

11:19.417 --> 11:20.375
to power her
through recess.

11:20.418 --> 11:21.463
How many of your students

11:21.506 --> 11:22.464
are eventually accepted

11:22.507 --> 11:24.205
into an Ivy League college?

11:24.248 --> 11:26.250
Approximately 29%,

11:26.294 --> 11:27.469
which is among the highest
in the country.

11:27.512 --> 11:30.037
Now, over in the distance
you can see

11:30.080 --> 11:32.561
our science lab, paid for

11:32.604 --> 11:34.432
by generous donations
of our parents.

11:34.476 --> 11:36.347
The fees alone, you could
buy yourself a small island

11:36.391 --> 11:38.219
in the Caribbean.
You got to make donations, too?

11:38.262 --> 11:40.438
David, shh.I know you have
our information packets,

11:40.482 --> 11:41.788
but I want to assure you
that I'm available

11:41.831 --> 11:42.789
throughout the tour

11:42.832 --> 11:45.052
and after
to answer any questions.

11:45.095 --> 11:46.314
Uh, I-I have a question.

11:46.357 --> 11:47.837
How much do you
need to donate

11:47.881 --> 11:50.100
in order to secure a spot
for your kid?

11:51.928 --> 11:54.278
We take a number
of factors into account,

11:54.322 --> 11:56.454
not just a family's ability
to contribute

11:56.498 --> 11:58.065
to our fundraising campaigns.

11:58.108 --> 12:01.111
We look at whether
the whole family,

12:01.155 --> 12:03.897
and not just the child,
is a good fit with the school.

12:05.072 --> 12:07.117
Shall we continue?

12:15.343 --> 12:17.040
Hey, Santos.

12:17.084 --> 12:18.172
I was just coming to find you.

12:18.215 --> 12:20.043
How you doing?Doctor says I'm lucky.

12:20.087 --> 12:22.132
Not sure I feel it.

12:22.176 --> 12:24.004
Please, tell me you caught
the man who robbed me.

12:24.047 --> 12:27.311
Not yet, but we think it was
a racially motivated crime.

12:29.139 --> 12:30.793
I won the lottery, you know...

12:30.837 --> 12:32.099
for a green card.

12:32.142 --> 12:33.535
It's all I ever wanted--

12:33.578 --> 12:35.058
to come to America.

12:35.102 --> 12:37.800
My family pooled
their savings,

12:37.844 --> 12:39.497
everything,
to buy me a ticket here,

12:39.541 --> 12:40.934
to help me start a business.

12:41.935 --> 12:43.371
I had no idea it
would be like this.

12:43.414 --> 12:45.808
I don't have enough insurance
to cover the damages.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.505
This will break me.

12:47.549 --> 12:49.029
Do you have any family
or friends,

12:49.072 --> 12:50.944
anyone who might be
able to help?
No.

12:50.987 --> 12:53.294
All I've done
since I came here is work.

12:53.337 --> 12:55.165
Now I've got nothing.

12:55.209 --> 12:57.298
How do I stay?

12:58.342 --> 13:00.127
The only helpful thing
I can say right now is,

13:00.170 --> 13:02.956
we're doing our absolute best
to find this guy,

13:02.999 --> 13:04.958
and you'll be the first
to know when we do.

13:05.001 --> 13:06.394
All right?

13:08.048 --> 13:09.919
I can't believe
we're having this conversation.

13:09.963 --> 13:11.312
She's not going there.

13:11.355 --> 13:12.835
Since when do you make
unilateral decisions

13:12.879 --> 13:14.881
about things that
concern our children?

13:14.924 --> 13:16.360
Annie, come on.

13:16.404 --> 13:18.145
How can you think that sending
her to that stuck-up place

13:18.188 --> 13:19.755
is a good idea?How could you think
it's not?

13:19.799 --> 13:21.061
Kids need to grow up

13:21.104 --> 13:23.106
around other kids
from different backgrounds.

13:23.150 --> 13:24.238
That's how you get them ready
for the real world,

13:24.281 --> 13:26.153
not with $15 green tea

13:26.196 --> 13:27.850
and ancient Greek.I agree.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.896
And our public school
is fine.

13:29.939 --> 13:31.332
A-And for the other kids,
that's the way we'll go,

13:31.375 --> 13:33.160
but Lila is struggling.

13:33.203 --> 13:35.336
Her grades are dropping,
and-and she hasn't been herself

13:35.379 --> 13:37.294
since our house got shot up.

13:37.338 --> 13:40.732
You don't realize the impact
this has had on her, David.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.169
How can you say that?

13:42.212 --> 13:44.562
Because every time
I bring it up,

13:44.606 --> 13:46.347
you say "kids are resilient,"

13:46.390 --> 13:48.044
but that's not always
the case.

13:48.088 --> 13:49.524
And-and this year's
been brutal on her,

13:49.567 --> 13:50.742
with the school closures,

13:50.786 --> 13:52.222
I mean,
on top of everything else.

13:54.790 --> 13:56.226
I thought therapy
was working.

13:57.619 --> 13:59.142
Her therapist is
the one who recommended

13:59.186 --> 14:01.144
she move schools.

14:01.188 --> 14:03.320
And this school has
a counselor who's trained

14:03.364 --> 14:05.148
in supporting kids with anxiety.

14:05.192 --> 14:08.891
They have small classes,
one-on-one support.

14:08.935 --> 14:11.111
And then there's
the theater and art programs,

14:11.154 --> 14:13.113
which she thinks will
really help Lila's confidence.

14:13.156 --> 14:14.505
What about the
academic pressure?

14:14.549 --> 14:16.116
I mean, you heard
that parent today asking

14:16.159 --> 14:17.291
about how many
of their students

14:17.334 --> 14:18.814
get into Ivy
League schools.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.598
His kid's going
into pre-K.I've done my research.

14:20.642 --> 14:23.166
Autrey is much less pressured
than the other private schools.

14:23.210 --> 14:24.820
And Lila's smart.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.256
I'm-I'm not worried
about that.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.257
I'm worried about

14:27.301 --> 14:28.780
her hating school so much

14:28.824 --> 14:31.044
that she's just gonna stop
engaging altogether.

14:31.087 --> 14:32.915
What about cost?We can afford it.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.917
The security business
has taken off.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.484
You said so yourself.

14:36.527 --> 14:37.964
We've paid all our debts.

14:38.007 --> 14:41.315
We have money in the bank,
which I'm so grateful for.

14:41.358 --> 14:43.404
But what is the point
of you working so hard

14:43.447 --> 14:45.232
if we can't spend the money
on our kids?

14:45.275 --> 14:46.494
Hey...

14:46.537 --> 14:47.712
it's not a luxury.

14:47.756 --> 14:50.106
If she gets in, she's going.

14:51.499 --> 14:53.153
That's gonna take
a miracle

14:53.196 --> 14:55.503
now that you've pissed off
the head of admissions.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.382
So, housewarming.

15:05.426 --> 15:06.427
I'll handle the margaritas.

15:06.470 --> 15:07.950
You handle the music.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.299
Sure.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.345
Let's hope they deliver
the sofa by then,

15:11.388 --> 15:12.302
or else we'll all be sitting
on the floor.

15:13.477 --> 15:14.870
Hey, Erika. There you are.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.350
Hey, what's this
I hear

15:16.393 --> 15:18.004
about you
and a badge bunny?

15:19.092 --> 15:20.876
What? It wasn't
a secret, was it?

15:20.920 --> 15:21.964
So, it was a guy.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.792
Does that make him
a badge Bugs Bunny?

15:25.533 --> 15:26.273
That's very funny.

15:26.316 --> 15:27.404
Ignore them.

15:27.448 --> 15:28.405
They'll eventually
get distracted

15:28.449 --> 15:29.580
by loud noises and wander off.

15:29.624 --> 15:30.581
On the straight though,

15:30.625 --> 15:32.932
I have heard
some horror stories.

15:32.975 --> 15:35.151
There was this one woman
down in Long Beach,

15:35.195 --> 15:37.371
she used to drive around
until she passed a patrol car,

15:37.414 --> 15:39.416
and then she'd
tap the gas

15:39.460 --> 15:40.896
and then go speeding by,
just so that

15:40.940 --> 15:42.942
they'd pull her over.You hear about that rookie cop

15:42.985 --> 15:44.247
who went home with that
woman he met on patrol?

15:44.291 --> 15:45.814
Next day she shows up
at the precinct

15:45.857 --> 15:48.338
with a plate of cookies,
iced with the LAPD logo.

15:48.382 --> 15:49.818
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Then-then she started posting

15:49.861 --> 15:52.473
poems on his social media,
sending him love letters.

15:52.516 --> 15:54.736
Finally, they put
a restraining order on her.

15:54.779 --> 15:56.346
So she drives her car
into the precinct,

15:56.390 --> 15:57.478
smashes through the wall,

15:57.521 --> 15:59.262
leaves her underwear
on his desk.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.612
Now she's writing him
sonnets from prison.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.269
I was coming to find you.

16:06.313 --> 16:07.662
There's been another attack.

16:07.705 --> 16:09.707
This time it looks like
an attempted mass shooting.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.535
Where?
Your neighborhood,
South L.A.

16:11.579 --> 16:13.494
Hair salon on Fremont.
Faith and Glory's.

16:13.537 --> 16:15.148
Yeah, I know the place.
My mother's been

16:15.191 --> 16:16.366
getting her hair done
there for 30 years.

16:16.410 --> 16:17.759
Wait a minute. Faith...Don't worry.

16:17.802 --> 16:19.369
No one got hurt,
except the suspect.

16:19.413 --> 16:21.589
He got killed by a customer,
ex-cop.

16:21.632 --> 16:23.721
Happened to be
carrying concealed.

16:23.765 --> 16:25.506
Suspect managed to get
a few shots off,

16:25.549 --> 16:26.507
but luckily didn't hit anyone.

16:26.550 --> 16:27.421
Got an I.D.

16:27.464 --> 16:28.683
Tobius Young.

16:28.726 --> 16:30.076
Few priors
for misdemeanor assault.

16:30.119 --> 16:32.339
Take a wild guess
as to what he was wearing.

16:32.382 --> 16:33.253
Flag bandana.

16:33.296 --> 16:34.428
Yep.
Look at this.

16:34.471 --> 16:36.299
May has the same tattoo
on his arm.

16:36.343 --> 16:37.518
An Iron Cross.

16:37.561 --> 16:38.867
That's not uncommon
with this crowd.
No,

16:38.910 --> 16:40.303
but it's the exact same design.

16:40.347 --> 16:42.001
I bet both tattoos
were done by the same artist.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.002
I'll look into it.This is Agent Carr.

16:43.045 --> 16:44.786
Let me patch her through.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.527
Agent Carr,
thanks for joining us.

16:46.570 --> 16:49.051
No problem. I read
the files you e-mailed over.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.922
You think it's
the Imperial Dukes?

16:50.966 --> 16:51.923
Certainly looks like it.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.360
So far their M.O. has been

16:53.403 --> 16:54.491
to carry out arson attacks
and robberies

16:54.535 --> 16:55.971
against minority businesses,

16:56.015 --> 16:57.668
but we've been
tracking talk online,

16:57.712 --> 16:59.018
and it suggests
they're escalating.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.323
Calls for mass shootings

17:00.367 --> 17:01.629
and attacks on places
of worship.

17:01.672 --> 17:04.066
We've identified
two suspects so far,

17:04.110 --> 17:05.067
trying to I.D.
the remaining ones.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.460
Could use your help.

17:06.503 --> 17:08.070
None of these guys
are on our radar.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.724
The problem
with the Imperial Dukes is

17:09.767 --> 17:11.291
they operate
in independent cells,

17:11.334 --> 17:14.076
each comprised of between four
and eight individuals.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.209
Makes it hard to I.D. anyone

17:16.252 --> 17:17.427
and even harder
to connect the cells.

17:17.471 --> 17:18.646
How many cells
we talking about?

17:18.689 --> 17:19.821
Oh, we estimate that nationwide

17:19.864 --> 17:21.562
there are hundreds and growing.

17:21.605 --> 17:23.390
In L.A., we guess
there are currently

17:23.433 --> 17:24.956
three or four active cells.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.567
Now, given the timings
of these attacks

17:26.610 --> 17:27.916
and the fact
they seem coordinated,

17:27.959 --> 17:29.526
I'd guess that so far,

17:29.570 --> 17:31.441
it's probably the work
of just one cell.

17:31.485 --> 17:33.226
So there could be six or seven
other suspects out there?

17:33.269 --> 17:34.836
All armed

17:34.879 --> 17:36.794
and willing to carry out
similar attacks?

17:36.838 --> 17:38.318
Yes, but the danger is

17:38.361 --> 17:40.450
the other cells will see this
as a call to arms.

17:40.494 --> 17:42.496
Well, we fight these guys
today, more spring up tomorrow.

17:42.539 --> 17:44.585
Yes. They aren't going away.

17:44.628 --> 17:46.282
If anything,
they're growing stronger.

17:46.326 --> 17:48.023
Every time we take down
a new cell,

17:48.067 --> 17:50.504
another one takes its place.What can you tell us about 'em?

17:50.547 --> 17:53.072
Oh, think of the Imperial Dukes
as neo-Nazis

17:53.115 --> 17:54.638
crossed with the KKK.

17:54.682 --> 17:56.901
Um, swastikas and assault rifles

17:56.945 --> 17:58.903
instead of hoods
and burning crosses.

17:58.947 --> 18:01.906
They believe America is
a white Christian nation

18:01.950 --> 18:03.125
and that it's under attack.

18:03.169 --> 18:04.605
From people of color.

18:04.648 --> 18:06.085
Don't forget the Jews
and Muslims.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.826
Basically, anyone who
doesn't fit their narrow idea

18:08.870 --> 18:10.393
of what an American should be.

18:10.437 --> 18:11.612
They have a leader?

18:11.655 --> 18:12.613
Anonymous.

18:12.656 --> 18:13.744
Posts his screeds online,

18:13.788 --> 18:16.095
calling for his followers
to "rise up

18:16.138 --> 18:18.619
and exterminate the vermin
before the country is overrun."

18:18.662 --> 18:19.837
That their
ultimate goal?

18:19.881 --> 18:21.404
Hitler's final solution?

18:21.448 --> 18:23.885
Their manifesto calls
for a crusade.

18:23.928 --> 18:25.582
Terror and mass killings,

18:25.626 --> 18:27.454
all in the hope
it will kick off a race war.

18:35.592 --> 18:37.116
Deac, thought
you had the day off.

18:37.159 --> 18:39.248
Yeah, just a couple things
I need to do. What's happening?

18:39.292 --> 18:42.251
Just waiting on
an investigation into something.

18:42.295 --> 18:44.558
Hey. Can I ask you
something?

18:44.601 --> 18:46.125
Yeah, sure.

18:46.168 --> 18:47.343
You went
to private school, right?

18:47.387 --> 18:48.866
Yeah. From
middle school on.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.868
Was it worth it?You mean,
was it worth

18:50.912 --> 18:53.175
my parents spending all
that money on my education?

18:53.219 --> 18:54.350
I don't know.

18:54.394 --> 18:55.525
Why do you ask?

18:55.569 --> 18:56.787
Well, we went
on that tour today,

18:56.831 --> 18:58.485
and, uh, Annie's convinced

18:58.528 --> 19:00.269
that Lila needs
to go there.But you're not.

19:00.313 --> 19:02.402
I mean,
the parking lot was full
of Porsches and Beamers.

19:02.445 --> 19:03.620
And every kid that goes there
seems to have

19:03.664 --> 19:04.795
their own YouTube channel.

19:04.839 --> 19:06.232
I-I think
it's the wrong environment.

19:06.275 --> 19:07.798
L.A. private schools are
a whole new level of crazy.

19:07.842 --> 19:11.062
Look, I was one of three
Asian kids at my school,

19:11.106 --> 19:12.716
and I got along just fine,
for the most part.

19:12.760 --> 19:15.415
If anything, it was my parents
who felt like the odd ones out.

19:15.458 --> 19:17.634
We weren't as well-off
as some of the other families,

19:17.678 --> 19:19.419
and they didn't speak
great English back then.

19:19.462 --> 19:22.422
But they still made it to every
game and parent conference.

19:22.465 --> 19:24.424
Thinking about it now,
I guess it was worth it.

19:24.467 --> 19:25.816
Definitely gave me
a lot of confidence.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.166
You should've seen me
before I went there.

19:27.209 --> 19:28.645
I was the shyest
kid in my class.

19:28.689 --> 19:29.951
You expect me
to believe that?

19:29.994 --> 19:32.171
Let me know what you decide.

19:33.259 --> 19:34.782
Miss Faith.

19:34.825 --> 19:36.262
Hondo?

19:36.305 --> 19:37.828
Look at you.

19:37.872 --> 19:39.439
[chuckles]No. Come on, now.

19:39.482 --> 19:41.397
[gasps]Look at you.
How you doing?

19:41.441 --> 19:43.530
I heard about your hair salon
this morning, and I'm so sorry.

19:43.573 --> 19:46.924
Not as sorry as that man
laying dead in my shop.

19:46.968 --> 19:49.144
Grateful though.
Could've been a lot worse.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.624
Shop's a mess though.

19:50.667 --> 19:53.453
And I had to come in
and give my statement.

19:53.496 --> 19:55.411
How long are you
gonna be closed for?

19:55.455 --> 19:56.934
I'll be open
by tomorrow morning.

19:56.978 --> 19:58.545
Can't disappoint
my customers.

19:59.720 --> 20:03.071
You know, my grandfather
was a preacher.

20:03.114 --> 20:04.507
Knoxville, Tennessee.

20:04.551 --> 20:06.857
His church was burned
to the ground.

20:06.901 --> 20:08.163
Back in the '60s?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.338
'98.

20:09.382 --> 20:11.558
Remember all those,
uh, arson attacks?

20:11.601 --> 20:12.602
Black churches?

20:12.646 --> 20:13.690
Yes, I do.

20:13.734 --> 20:17.085
He built that church
three times over.

20:17.128 --> 20:19.696
They kept burning it down. He
kept building it right back up.

20:19.740 --> 20:22.525
So I have no excuse.

20:22.569 --> 20:24.310
Well, if there's one thing
I know about you, Faith,

20:24.353 --> 20:26.268
is you come from
a family of fighters.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.879
Do I have any other option?

20:28.923 --> 20:32.100
You tell your mama
I'll see her on Friday.

20:32.143 --> 20:34.537
You're welcome to pop on by
anytime you want.

20:34.581 --> 20:36.365
Door's always open.All right.

20:36.409 --> 20:37.758
Yes.You stay safe out there.

20:37.801 --> 20:41.109
But you know if you need
anything, I got your back.

20:41.152 --> 20:42.676
Thank you.

20:52.816 --> 20:55.123
Hi.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.559
Uh, you remember Vanessa.

20:56.603 --> 20:58.561
Her daughter goes
to day care with Victoria.

20:58.605 --> 21:00.520
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Nice to see you again.

21:00.563 --> 21:01.912
You, too.Her children go to Autrey,

21:01.956 --> 21:04.306
so she's helping me fill out
this application form.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.395
Mind if I join?

21:06.439 --> 21:07.614
Sure.

21:08.963 --> 21:10.225
So, uh...

21:10.269 --> 21:12.488
what do we got to do,
just fill this out?

21:12.532 --> 21:15.665
I think
I should maybe prepare you.

21:15.709 --> 21:18.625
I hate to say it,
but you have more of a chance

21:18.668 --> 21:20.670
of being selected
for a NASA space mission

21:20.714 --> 21:23.107
than you have
of getting her into Autrey.

21:23.151 --> 21:24.152
It can't be that hard,

21:24.195 --> 21:25.849
can it?It is, believe me.

21:25.893 --> 21:28.591
But if you hold
certain cards

21:28.635 --> 21:30.332
and you know how
to use them,

21:30.376 --> 21:32.639
then you definitely have

21:32.682 --> 21:35.119
making a six-figure donation
to the school's capital fund?

21:35.163 --> 21:36.512
Sure.

21:36.556 --> 21:39.080
There are
other cards, though.

21:39.123 --> 21:40.995
Does Lila have any skills
or special talents?

21:41.038 --> 21:42.823
Like, does she speak
a second language?

21:44.651 --> 21:46.087
Oh. Does she code?

21:48.176 --> 21:50.439
Uh, does she play
an instrument, maybe?

21:50.483 --> 21:52.267
She plays the clarinet.Oh. Okay.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.224
But not very well.

21:53.268 --> 21:55.226
No.Okay, well,

21:55.270 --> 21:56.489
what about sports?She takes after me,

21:56.532 --> 21:57.707
not David, in the
sports department,

21:57.751 --> 21:59.622
so...You also need people

21:59.666 --> 22:00.928
who can vouch for you.

22:00.971 --> 22:03.539
I mean, obviously,
I can put in a word, but...

22:03.583 --> 22:04.845
if you know anyone
on the board...

22:06.281 --> 22:07.674
Ultimately, though,

22:07.717 --> 22:09.632
it's the head of admissions
you need to win over.

22:09.676 --> 22:11.547
I mean, those people
are like Saint Peter

22:11.591 --> 22:12.940
guarding the
gates of heaven.

22:12.983 --> 22:15.421
Uh, and...

22:15.464 --> 22:18.206
Marian Evans may look
like a pushover,

22:18.249 --> 22:21.078
but believe me,
many people have tried

22:21.122 --> 22:23.037
to win her over and failed.

22:25.822 --> 22:27.607
I guessed it was prison
ink from the stippling--

22:27.650 --> 22:28.651
I was right.

22:28.695 --> 22:30.174
May got his
tattoo in jail.

22:30.218 --> 22:31.698
Showed up on his
inmate record.

22:31.741 --> 22:33.613
I ran the names
of other prisoners

22:33.656 --> 22:35.397
he was inside with
and found this guy.

22:35.441 --> 22:36.616
Jedd Barstow.

22:36.659 --> 22:38.269
Barstow did five years
for gunrunning.

22:38.313 --> 22:39.662
He's out now,

22:39.706 --> 22:41.534
and he's got a tattoo parlor
in Chatsworth.

22:41.577 --> 22:42.883
Big biker hangout.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.711
Some motorcycle gangs
like to mix the open road

22:44.754 --> 22:46.539
with a little white supremacy.

22:46.582 --> 22:48.584
Yeah. This is the
guy's website.

22:48.628 --> 22:50.804
He's got an online gallery
full of racist ink.

22:50.847 --> 22:52.414
Let's see what he knows.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.242
He's done time
on weapons charges.

22:54.285 --> 22:56.070
SWAT needs to be the ones
that bring him in.

22:56.113 --> 22:57.854
Absolutely.
Let's get on it.

23:03.294 --> 23:04.818
Jedd Barstow?

23:04.861 --> 23:06.733
Yeah, what?

23:09.736 --> 23:12.391
Oh!

23:12.434 --> 23:14.305
Stop squirming like a baby.

23:14.349 --> 23:15.568
You're under arrest.

23:20.050 --> 23:22.444
But it's not finished--
she's only got one wing.

23:22.488 --> 23:24.751
Guess she'll be flying in
circles, then. Come on.

23:29.495 --> 23:30.974
Barstow's not talking, either.

23:31.018 --> 23:33.412
You only run from SWAT if
you're incredibly stupid...

23:33.455 --> 23:35.979
Or you think
you got nothing to lose.

23:37.285 --> 23:39.592
You see
the tattoo wall of fame?

23:39.635 --> 23:41.768
More like wall of shame.

23:42.812 --> 23:44.423
There's a break in the wall.

23:44.466 --> 23:45.772
Looks like a door.

24:03.572 --> 24:05.356
Check out
all this stuff.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.750
The Imperial Dukes
are definitely meeting here.

24:09.883 --> 24:11.754
Interesting version of church.

24:13.713 --> 24:16.890
Guess I'm at the top
of their hit list.

24:18.369 --> 24:20.284
My dad's Black
and my mom's white.

24:20.328 --> 24:21.547
I'm a bisexual Latina

24:21.590 --> 24:23.331
from an immigrant family,
sure they love me.

24:23.374 --> 24:24.637
Yeah, all of us.

24:24.680 --> 24:27.466
I don't even know
what a race war is. Anyone?

24:27.509 --> 24:28.858
Guess they figure if
they push hard enough,

24:28.902 --> 24:31.557
eventually people
are gonna push back.

24:31.600 --> 24:34.777
Cue riots. End of days.

24:34.821 --> 24:36.562
The U.S. suddenly becomes
a white Christian caliphate.

24:36.605 --> 24:38.912
Totally makes sense.It's just propaganda.

24:38.955 --> 24:40.696
They need someone to hate,
'cause they know

24:40.740 --> 24:41.915
they're on
their way out.

24:41.958 --> 24:43.264
Power's slipping away,
and they know it.

24:43.307 --> 24:44.526
Happy to speed
that process up.

24:44.570 --> 24:45.875
The danger is to all the people

24:45.919 --> 24:47.486
who are gonna get hurt
before we stop them.

24:47.529 --> 24:48.878
There's nothing
here that gives us

24:48.922 --> 24:50.706
any clue as to what
they might have planned next.

24:50.750 --> 24:52.491
We don't even know who the
other members of the cell are.

24:52.534 --> 24:53.535
If this is their
sicko version

24:53.579 --> 24:55.145
of church, you think
they have meetings

24:55.189 --> 24:57.800
on Sundays?That's the one day the
tattoo parlor is closed.

24:57.844 --> 24:59.715
We can ask for
a geofence warrant, get a list

24:59.759 --> 25:01.891
of all the active cell phones
within the area on Sundays.

25:01.935 --> 25:04.938
Should get us I.D.s of
everyone who attends church.Great.

25:04.981 --> 25:06.330
Then we can bring them
all in for confession.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.778
Oh, God.

25:18.821 --> 25:20.780
What?It's him from last night.
He's texting me.

25:20.823 --> 25:22.259
Michael B. Jordan?

25:22.303 --> 25:24.044
What does he want?Another date.

25:24.087 --> 25:26.568
Hey, that's a good thing, right?I don't know.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.352
To be honest, you and Street
kind of have me freaked out.

25:28.396 --> 25:29.919
What if he's got
some kind of cop fetish,

25:29.963 --> 25:31.486
and it's more
about the uniform than me?

25:31.530 --> 25:33.183
You said you had fun with him.

25:33.227 --> 25:34.620
Yeah, he was super cute.

25:34.663 --> 25:35.838
And he hasn't plowed

25:35.882 --> 25:37.666
through HQ's walls--
not yet, at least.

25:41.278 --> 25:43.063
Geofence warrant came back?

25:43.106 --> 25:44.847
Cell phone records confirm
that Tobius Young--

25:44.891 --> 25:47.154
the hair salon shooter--
and Christopher May--

25:47.197 --> 25:48.982
the gas station robber--
both met

25:49.025 --> 25:50.679
at Barstow's tattoo parlor,

25:50.723 --> 25:52.028
along with these two.

25:52.072 --> 25:54.117
Abel McConnell.
From his height and build,

25:54.161 --> 25:55.466
we think he's
the convenience store robber.

25:55.510 --> 25:58.382
Then there's Julian Matthews,
Army veteran,

25:58.426 --> 26:00.863
dishonorably discharged
for a violent hazing

26:00.907 --> 26:03.474
against a Black cadet.His social media
is full of, uh,

26:03.518 --> 26:05.825
well, exactly
what you'd imagine.He's also posted

26:05.868 --> 26:07.261
links to terrorist attacks

26:07.304 --> 26:09.089
in other countries.We found the last known address

26:09.132 --> 26:11.526
for him--
place out in the Valley.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.614
I'll call Agent Carr,

26:12.658 --> 26:13.876
have her meet us
out there with her team.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.748
Let's go, then.

26:18.185 --> 26:20.361
There's no sign of Matthews.

26:20.404 --> 26:21.928
We did a
full search,

26:21.971 --> 26:24.017
but the place is a maze--
half a dozen outbuildings,

26:24.060 --> 26:25.758
piles of junk
everywhere.We found a gun safe

26:25.801 --> 26:27.150
in one of the buildings--
managed to get it cracked.

26:27.194 --> 26:28.195
He's got
more weapons stockpiled

26:28.238 --> 26:29.457
than the National Guard Armory.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.241
Might be an idea
to put the place

26:31.285 --> 26:32.199
under surveillance
in case Matthews

26:32.242 --> 26:33.809
or anyone else comes back.

26:33.853 --> 26:35.158
Agreed.
I'll pull my team out

26:35.202 --> 26:36.986
and put agents
on round-the-clock watch.

26:37.030 --> 26:38.118
Hey, check this out.
I found Matthews.

26:38.161 --> 26:40.033
He's livestreaming right now.

26:40.076 --> 26:41.425
I told you we'd be back.

26:41.469 --> 26:43.166
The Imperial Dukes are
on a crusade.

26:43.210 --> 26:44.428
And now...

26:44.472 --> 26:46.735
it's time for the first skirmish

26:46.779 --> 26:48.955
Where is he?

26:48.998 --> 26:51.218
I have no idea.Wait a minute.

26:51.261 --> 26:52.785
I recognize
that building.

26:52.828 --> 26:54.743
Yeah, that's the Weiss
Jewish Community Center.

26:54.787 --> 26:57.006
I'll call them and tell them
you're on your way. Go!

26:57.050 --> 26:59.356
All 20-Squad,
get to the Gurkha, ASAP.

27:16.722 --> 27:18.245
Help me! Quickly!

27:18.288 --> 27:19.725
What's going on?
Is that gunfire?

27:19.768 --> 27:20.856
Stay down. Stay down.
Don't move!

27:20.900 --> 27:21.857
Come on!

27:26.209 --> 27:28.690
We need to call the police.They're on their way.

27:51.757 --> 27:54.716
I know you're hiding.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.678
I know you're in here!

28:44.723 --> 28:46.812
Can't hide forever!

29:03.916 --> 29:05.439
He's still livestreaming.

29:05.482 --> 29:08.007
20-David to 24-David,
he's in a large hallway.

29:08.050 --> 29:09.791
Heading into the east wing.

29:13.142 --> 29:17.146
Who's afraid
of the big bad wolf?!

29:25.459 --> 29:29.028
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

29:31.726 --> 29:33.162
Shh. Keep it down.

29:33.206 --> 29:34.207
[shushing]Keep it down.

29:36.122 --> 29:37.340
Shh. Baby, you got to be quiet.

29:37.384 --> 29:38.385
He can hear us.

29:50.266 --> 29:52.225
Shots fired. Kitchen area.

30:19.121 --> 30:21.471
You hear the piggies squealing?

30:21.515 --> 30:23.996
Well, they're gonna squeal
a whole lot more.

30:29.958 --> 30:31.481
LAPD!

30:31.525 --> 30:32.613
Put it on the ground!

30:32.656 --> 30:34.093
Put it down!
On the ground.

30:34.136 --> 30:35.442
And the phone, too.

30:44.277 --> 30:47.062
Get your hands off me,
you n...

30:47.106 --> 30:48.759
Finish that sentence.

30:48.803 --> 30:50.500
Finish it.

30:56.071 --> 30:57.420
<i>Commander,</i>

30:57.464 --> 30:59.422
any word on the last
suspect, McConnell?No.

30:59.466 --> 31:02.425
But you'll be the first to know
as soon as I hear something.

31:02.469 --> 31:04.079
Yeah, I'm not sure

31:04.123 --> 31:07.169
I would have been able to keep
my cool if I was in your shoes.

31:07.561 --> 31:10.477
You're not in my shoes, sir.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.959
Well, true.

31:14.002 --> 31:17.614
I-I only meant
that I wouldn't blame you

31:17.658 --> 31:19.355
if you were angry.

31:23.359 --> 31:25.840
Who says I'm not?

31:27.842 --> 31:29.757
What, because I didn't
beat that guy's ass

31:29.800 --> 31:30.932
when I had the chance to?

31:30.976 --> 31:33.587
Sir, I live being Black
every day.

31:33.630 --> 31:35.415
They <i>want</i>us to get angry.

31:35.458 --> 31:37.591
They want us to react.

31:37.634 --> 31:39.506
They're trying to provoke us
into fighting back,

31:39.549 --> 31:42.422
but I just ain't into giving
these clowns what they want.

31:44.467 --> 31:46.905
Yeah. I'm...

31:46.948 --> 31:49.864
I'm sorry
you had to go through all that.

31:59.569 --> 32:01.702
Erika.Hey.

32:01.745 --> 32:03.182
Hey, listen, it was good

32:03.225 --> 32:04.574
having you out there
with my team today.

32:04.618 --> 32:06.489
Now I can see why
Rocker's a little worried

32:06.533 --> 32:07.882
that I might steal you
for 20-David.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.666
Thanks.

32:09.710 --> 32:11.320
Good job.

32:16.064 --> 32:17.805
Your ride?

32:17.848 --> 32:20.068
Yeah.
Still got some payments left,

32:20.112 --> 32:22.810
but this is my baby.Sweet.

32:22.853 --> 32:24.812
Where you zooming off to?I thought I'd go
to that convenience store

32:24.855 --> 32:27.728
while we got some downtime.The one that got
firebombed by McConnell?

32:27.771 --> 32:29.295
Yeah, I wanted
to tell the owner

32:29.338 --> 32:30.731
that we caught
the guy that robbed him,

32:30.774 --> 32:32.385
but seeing as
I can't do that,

32:32.428 --> 32:33.734
figured
I'd at least lend a hand

32:33.777 --> 32:35.083
cleaning up the mess,
you know?

32:35.127 --> 32:36.171
Well, you want some company?

32:36.215 --> 32:37.607
Sure. Yeah, that'd be great.

32:37.651 --> 32:39.522
Cool. Maybe we should
ask the others.

32:39.566 --> 32:41.046
Many hands make light work.All right.

32:46.138 --> 32:48.096
Mr. Kay.Hi.

32:48.140 --> 32:49.793
I was actually just coming
to see you.

32:49.837 --> 32:51.230
Um, you got a minute?

32:51.273 --> 32:52.622
You can walk me to my car.

32:52.666 --> 32:55.103
I-I just...
I need to apologize.

32:55.147 --> 32:57.976
I-I came into this process
with the wrong attitude.

32:58.019 --> 33:01.022
See, I work
in public service, and...

33:01.066 --> 33:03.024
and I believe
in public schools.I understand.

33:03.068 --> 33:04.765
Autrey isn't for everyone.

33:04.808 --> 33:06.767
Well, that-that's the thing.

33:06.810 --> 33:09.117
Um, see, I-I really do think

33:09.161 --> 33:11.424
that-that this
is the right place for Lila.

33:11.467 --> 33:13.078
She's been struggling
where she is,

33:13.121 --> 33:14.862
and, to tell you the truth,
it's my fault.

33:14.905 --> 33:17.647
I brought my work home with me,
and it's affected her.

33:17.691 --> 33:20.476
I know. I read about what
happened in the paper.

33:21.521 --> 33:24.741
Yeah. Well, she's-she's
still shaken up by it.

33:24.785 --> 33:26.047
See, my wife and I,
we agree

33:26.091 --> 33:28.789
that she could really benefit
from coming here.

33:28.832 --> 33:32.053
All right. Well, um, if you
fill out the application

33:32.097 --> 33:34.273
and she does well
on her ISEE...

33:34.316 --> 33:37.276
Um, I-I should
warn you, though,

33:37.319 --> 33:40.148
the application
process is very...Competitive. No, I know.

33:40.192 --> 33:42.716
I-I'm not worried
about Lila's scores.

33:42.759 --> 33:45.980
She's a smart kid.
I am worried that as a family,

33:46.024 --> 33:47.764
we wouldn't score
as high as others.

33:47.808 --> 33:49.723
See, I-I can't, um...

33:49.766 --> 33:52.378
I can't afford to write
a blank check every year

33:52.421 --> 33:54.162
to f-finance a new science wing.

33:54.206 --> 33:57.296
But I can contribute
in other ways,

33:57.339 --> 34:00.864
ways that are more valuable.

34:01.952 --> 34:05.695
For example,
there are critical errors

34:05.739 --> 34:07.828
in your security plan here.Excuse me?

34:07.871 --> 34:10.613
You don't have a relationship
with a public safety official,

34:10.657 --> 34:13.007
as recommended
by the state.Yes, we do.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.792
Ken DeMarco. Yeah,
he's listed as your liaison,

34:15.836 --> 34:18.795
but, well,
he retired from LAPD last year.

34:19.883 --> 34:21.842
When was the last time
you had SWAT run

34:21.885 --> 34:23.322
a rapid response practice here?

34:23.365 --> 34:25.889
I looked it up.
I-It was five years ago.

34:25.933 --> 34:27.674
And since then,
you have added a science block.

34:27.717 --> 34:29.719
You've added a cafeteria.

34:29.763 --> 34:31.330
The blueprints
and the floor plans

34:31.373 --> 34:33.549
that LAPD has for this school,
they're out of date.

34:33.593 --> 34:35.725
Now, I could volunteer my time,

34:35.769 --> 34:37.945
be your SWAT liaison.

34:37.988 --> 34:41.122
I could take some time
to look over the security plan,

34:41.166 --> 34:42.863
make sure it's up to par.

34:43.907 --> 34:45.387
I'm sure the parents
at this school

34:45.431 --> 34:49.522
are very security-conscious
with the way the world is.

34:49.565 --> 34:51.089
Thank you.

34:51.132 --> 34:53.613
I'm-I'm sure the board
would appreciate that.

34:53.656 --> 34:54.831
You're welcome.

34:54.875 --> 34:57.443
I'll-I'll get right on it.Okay.

34:57.486 --> 34:59.097
Um, Mr. Kay?

34:59.140 --> 35:00.968
I meant what I said.

35:01.011 --> 35:03.405
I-I look forward
to seeing Lila's transcript.

35:03.449 --> 35:05.668
And if it's good
and she scores well,

35:05.712 --> 35:08.193
we'll be happy
to consider her application.

35:08.236 --> 35:09.281
Thank you.

35:15.417 --> 35:17.376
So, you text

35:17.419 --> 35:19.160
that badge bunny back yet?

35:19.204 --> 35:21.554
You guys tell
each other everything?No secrets

35:21.597 --> 35:23.077
between family.

35:23.121 --> 35:26.167
And now you're an honorary
member of the 20-Squad family,

35:26.211 --> 35:28.822
So, what's up?

35:28.865 --> 35:29.997
Are you gonna see this
guy again or what?

35:30.040 --> 35:31.999
I think I'm gonna
politely decline.

35:32.042 --> 35:35.872
Hey, I met my girl
at a coffee shop.

35:35.916 --> 35:38.005
She flirted with me, asked me
straight up for my number.

35:38.048 --> 35:40.834
Later, she told me it was the
uniform that did it for her.

35:40.877 --> 35:42.618
Wasn't like she was into cops,
though. I was the first one

35:42.662 --> 35:43.967
she'd dated.And the last.

35:44.011 --> 35:45.534
They're getting married.

35:45.578 --> 35:47.971
Oh,
Tan's right, though.

35:48.015 --> 35:49.973
Don't let us put you off.
I mean, we're just teasing.

35:50.017 --> 35:52.019
Yeah, if you like this guy,
you should give him a shot.

35:52.062 --> 35:53.803
And then report back to us
on how it went.

35:53.847 --> 35:54.978
And if he
does turn out to be

35:55.022 --> 35:56.415
some crazy dude
who's into poetry,

35:56.458 --> 35:58.025
we can help you fast-track
the restraining order.

35:59.896 --> 36:01.420
Thank you.

36:01.463 --> 36:05.032
I don't know what else to say
but thank you.

36:05.075 --> 36:06.686
I just called my
family to tell them.

36:06.729 --> 36:08.035
They all say the same.

36:08.078 --> 36:09.515
You gonna be able
to get back in business?

36:10.690 --> 36:12.300
My father says
to ignore the haters

36:12.344 --> 36:14.041
and never quit on my dreams.

36:14.084 --> 36:15.869
I'll find a way.

36:18.045 --> 36:19.829
All right,
sorry, Santos.

36:19.873 --> 36:21.135
We got a hit.

36:21.179 --> 36:23.137
We'll try
to swing by later.

36:23.964 --> 36:26.662
McConnell was spotted
entering the compound

36:26.706 --> 36:28.273
about 40 minutes ago.Guys doing surveillance

36:28.316 --> 36:30.318
thought they heard
a single gunshot not long after.

36:30.362 --> 36:31.711
And McConnell hasn't responded

36:31.754 --> 36:33.800
to multiple attempts
at contact since.

36:33.843 --> 36:35.671
You think it's suicide?
Maybe.

36:35.715 --> 36:37.804
Or he could be barricaded
inside somewhere,

36:37.847 --> 36:38.718
waiting for us to make a move.

36:38.761 --> 36:40.067
I mean, we got helicopters,

36:40.110 --> 36:41.677
but there's no way
of getting eyes on him.

36:41.721 --> 36:43.157
All the windows
are boarded up.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.637
If he is still
alive, we don't want

36:44.680 --> 36:45.942
this turning into a siege

36:45.986 --> 36:46.987
that he can then
turn into a press conference

36:47.030 --> 36:48.423
to promote their agenda.

36:48.467 --> 36:49.990
It's better we go in sooner
rather than later.

36:50.033 --> 36:51.513
FBI has asked SWAT
to do the honors.

36:51.557 --> 36:54.821
Their HRT is on a mission
down in Long Beach.

36:54.864 --> 36:56.823
I'll ready my team for entry.

37:16.321 --> 37:17.844
Chris.

37:35.470 --> 37:38.734
26-David,
no sign of the suspect.

37:50.790 --> 37:53.140
I hear movement.Someone's going up the stairs.

37:53.183 --> 37:56.099
24-David, we've got movement
on the stairs.

38:08.155 --> 38:09.461
Give me two!

38:11.593 --> 38:14.030
Shots fired!
Coming from the attic.

38:19.079 --> 38:20.994
He's above us.

38:21.037 --> 38:22.822
Somewhere in the ceiling.

38:22.865 --> 38:25.825
What's happening?He's in the attic!
We need cover!

38:28.915 --> 38:31.134
I'm hit!

38:31.178 --> 38:33.049
EMT and an ambulance
are standing by.

38:33.093 --> 38:36.444
Tell me when you're Code 4
for entry.I'll cover you. Go! Go!

38:38.185 --> 38:39.447
Get him out!

38:42.276 --> 38:43.625
Cease-fire!

38:49.631 --> 38:51.981
Street.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.431
Suspect down.

39:06.474 --> 39:08.476
Clear for entry.

39:08.520 --> 39:11.392
Let's go. Go! Go!

39:21.837 --> 39:23.012
Just a scratch.

39:23.056 --> 39:24.144
Yeah.

39:24.187 --> 39:25.972
Another scar
to add to the collection.

39:29.976 --> 39:32.370
You okay? Hey.

39:32.413 --> 39:34.981
I think I was hit, too.

39:39.159 --> 39:41.074
We need a medic!

39:41.117 --> 39:42.336
Come on.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.164
[Chris breathing heavily]Over here! Now!

39:44.207 --> 39:46.035
Erika!

39:48.951 --> 39:50.736
Come on!

39:50.779 --> 39:53.042
Come on.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.377
Don't stop.
You got to keep going.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.248
I'm really sorry.Don't stop.

40:25.292 --> 40:26.989
Don't.I'm sorry.

40:29.557 --> 40:30.776
Come on!

40:35.084 --> 40:37.957
Stop. She's gone.

40:40.568 --> 40:42.048
She's gone.

40:48.097 --> 40:50.404
No.
