02:05.500 --> 02:07.560
Are you going to
drink today?

02:07.560 --> 02:09.100
Of course I am.

02:09.100 --> 02:11.400
I drink 365 days a year.

02:16.900 --> 02:19.760
Hey, what is that?

02:20.230 --> 02:22.200
Are we expecting
another boat?

02:22.200 --> 02:24.030
All fishing boats
have returned.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.430
Then, what boat is that?

02:27.430 --> 02:28.500
Oh, my legs...

02:32.430 --> 02:33.829
Jae-bok.

02:34.630 --> 02:37.560
It's not answering the radio.

02:37.560 --> 02:38.460
What?

03:04.360 --> 03:05.430
Excuse me?

03:06.600 --> 03:08.000
Is anyone here?

03:09.160 --> 03:10.430
Is it a boat from China?

03:13.130 --> 03:15.400
What is this smell?

03:15.400 --> 03:16.460
Does it smell?

03:17.400 --> 03:20.130
Why doesn't this boat have
any working equipment?

03:20.930 --> 03:22.200
Is it a smuggling boat?

03:49.260 --> 03:51.260
What the hell...

03:56.000 --> 03:57.829
This is messed up.

04:04.800 --> 04:05.830
Huh?

04:13.700 --> 04:15.530
Who the hell are you?

04:15.530 --> 04:18.000
Did you kill him?

04:23.930 --> 04:25.260
He must have...

04:27.300 --> 04:28.800
Eaten him.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.860
Sir, I'm calling stop.

06:41.300 --> 06:42.330
Damn it!

06:42.930 --> 06:45.400
You ruin everything, Gil-suk.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.830
You shouldn't take
your henchman's money.

06:48.330 --> 06:49.460
Shut up.

06:49.460 --> 06:50.530
Why are you here?

06:50.930 --> 06:52.700
I need to use
an excavator.

06:52.700 --> 06:54.760
An excavator?
Why?

06:54.760 --> 06:57.530
One of our boys called
Duk-gu is getting married.

06:58.230 --> 06:59.460
We're throwing him a party.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.360
Here, just take it.

07:01.360 --> 07:02.430
Yes, sir.

07:09.530 --> 07:12.530
Bo-ram, I love you!

07:13.000 --> 07:18.860
Once we're married,
I'll never cheat on you!

07:18.860 --> 07:21.400
Even if they take me
to a room salon...

07:21.400 --> 07:22.330
Hey!

07:30.930 --> 07:33.659
Raise your voice!
I can't hear you!

07:33.659 --> 07:34.900
Come on!

07:35.400 --> 07:36.960
Bo-ram!

07:37.560 --> 07:40.830
I'll never love anyone else!

07:40.830 --> 07:42.600
Stop laughing!

07:42.600 --> 07:43.800
Lower him.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.360
You're doing great, Duk-gu!

07:50.230 --> 07:52.260
Are you sure
he'll survive that?

07:52.260 --> 07:54.630
People don't die that easily.

07:54.630 --> 07:56.460
That's enough.

07:56.460 --> 07:58.330
We still need to beat him.

07:59.330 --> 08:00.100
Hey!

08:06.300 --> 08:10.160
Duk-gu, not bad!
That was impressive!

08:13.760 --> 08:16.700
Sir, you should head out.

08:17.530 --> 08:18.460
Why?

08:31.430 --> 08:32.559
Gather everyone.

08:33.960 --> 08:36.130
- Gather everyone.
- Yes, sir.

08:36.130 --> 08:36.830
Hey!

08:37.059 --> 08:38.630
Let's go.

08:42.159 --> 08:45.000
The groom shouldn't
go anywhere.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.760
- Get back in the water.
- Yes, sir.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.600
Where the hell
are you going?

09:04.430 --> 09:05.900
They're still in the room.

09:05.900 --> 09:07.200
We have the room number.

09:10.960 --> 09:14.200
My men were just
about to arrest them.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.200
Any thoughts?

09:15.200 --> 09:18.530
Obviously, I'm really sorry.

09:18.530 --> 09:20.100
This is serious.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.500
You think this is okay?

09:22.500 --> 09:24.230
Of course not.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.500
I know that.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.930
What the hell...

09:28.560 --> 09:31.900
I'll let this one slide,
but this is the last time.

09:31.900 --> 09:33.060
Message received.

09:33.060 --> 09:35.760
You're the police, so go
take care of civilians.

09:35.760 --> 09:37.930
- You bastard.
- We'll handle it, sir.

09:37.930 --> 09:39.930
- Get off of me.
- You can go now.

09:40.730 --> 09:42.230
If I get another report...

09:44.100 --> 09:45.160
Damn it.

09:58.900 --> 10:02.900
What's wrong, baby?

10:02.900 --> 10:04.260
There's nothing there!

10:12.860 --> 10:17.700
These kids must be crazy.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.430
Who the hell are you?

10:27.200 --> 10:28.260
How dare you!

10:29.000 --> 10:30.200
Son of a bitch!

10:39.530 --> 10:43.660
These damn kids are
really using drugs.

10:44.400 --> 10:48.500
Don't ruin the city that's
about to host the Olympics.

10:50.130 --> 10:51.230
Where are they?

10:53.560 --> 10:54.360
Sir...

10:55.160 --> 10:58.400
- Why are you here?
- What the hell?

10:58.860 --> 11:00.430
What do you want?

11:01.260 --> 11:04.700
Why are so many
henchmen here?

11:22.560 --> 11:24.760
Hey!
Clean up this mess.

11:40.360 --> 11:41.560
Lift your glass.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.700
Come on.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.960
You shouldn't have
barged in like that.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.560
Stop it.

11:56.560 --> 11:59.830
You know you shouldn't
be selling drugs.

11:59.830 --> 12:01.600
Don't be mad at me.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.730
I had no idea.

12:03.730 --> 12:06.700
Should I be watching
my men's every move?

12:06.700 --> 12:07.860
Don't be ridiculous.

12:07.860 --> 12:10.530
You're responsible for them.

12:10.530 --> 12:14.130
I had to stop the police
from arresting them.

12:14.130 --> 12:15.460
We should handle it ourselves.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.630
- Isn't that right, sir?
- Of course it is.

12:19.630 --> 12:22.200
Gil-suk is a thoughtful guy.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.460
Thoughtful, my ass.

12:25.930 --> 12:27.630
Here comes the boss.

12:33.960 --> 12:34.900
Hello, sir.

12:34.900 --> 12:37.130
There's the groom.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.630
- Hello, sir.
- Welcome.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.130
Why do you have
a foreign phone?

13:07.730 --> 13:10.260
So, you've been fighting?

13:11.660 --> 13:13.760
- No, sir.
- Not at all.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.200
I heard about everything.

13:23.330 --> 13:27.500
In my opinion, your gang did
wrong for selling drugs.

13:29.030 --> 13:31.730
Your gang also did
wrong for interfering.

13:34.400 --> 13:37.000
- Gyeongpo Gang.
- Yes, sir.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.730
If I see drugs in
Gangneung again...

13:42.160 --> 13:44.660
I'll put a hole
through your skull.

13:46.030 --> 13:47.400
Yes, sir.

13:48.900 --> 13:51.360
- Taekji Gang.
- Yes, sir.

13:51.830 --> 13:55.030
You're all part of
the same family.

13:55.030 --> 13:57.630
Don't fight with
your little brother.

13:58.900 --> 13:59.960
Yes, sir.

14:00.500 --> 14:01.730
Listen up.

14:03.430 --> 14:06.430
If the Taekji Gang and
Gyeongpo Gang fight...

14:06.930 --> 14:08.860
I'll blame you,
the big brother.

14:08.860 --> 14:09.760
Yes, sir.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.300
Give me a cigarette.

14:17.130 --> 14:18.430
Something I can chew on.

14:19.130 --> 14:20.330
Here you go, sir.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.460
He's here, sir.

15:06.460 --> 15:07.960
How much debt
do you have?

15:10.260 --> 15:11.560
7 million won.

15:12.900 --> 15:14.500
That's the world for you.

15:15.900 --> 15:19.700
Some guys can drink away
7 million over a single night.

15:20.230 --> 15:23.660
But some guys die because
they don't have 7 million.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.560
I'm doing this to survive.

15:30.230 --> 15:34.530
I hope you survive, too.

15:50.360 --> 15:51.960
Get back to your game.

16:09.300 --> 16:10.460
I'm here.

16:14.330 --> 16:18.000
- Did you eat?
- Yes, I did.

16:19.800 --> 16:25.160
When people meet at this hour,
they usually eat together.

16:25.830 --> 16:27.060
Let's eat, then.

16:31.360 --> 16:33.760
Why are you here?

16:35.530 --> 16:38.560
I want the shares of
the resort in Gangneung.

16:38.560 --> 16:41.960
I got you the shares
instead of cash.

16:43.260 --> 16:44.800
I need it.

16:45.560 --> 16:49.100
Shin is taking care
of those shares.

16:49.100 --> 16:52.630
But they're still yours.

16:52.630 --> 16:55.760
I gave you some business
when you left the gang.

16:57.060 --> 17:00.660
You gave me a
debt collecting business.

17:00.660 --> 17:04.099
I run around collecting
money from your debtors.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.160
Your words cut like a knife.

17:35.160 --> 17:38.460
I've killed over
10 people for you...

17:38.460 --> 17:43.530
You got your hands dirty,
so you want a new deal?

17:43.530 --> 17:46.800
I've been doing dirty work
for over 10 years.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.660
It's not too much to ask.

17:54.660 --> 17:56.860
You earned a living in return.

17:56.860 --> 17:58.460
We gave you
money and power.

17:59.130 --> 18:00.900
You used to have nothing.

18:04.730 --> 18:08.300
This is why I don't
like conversation.

18:09.200 --> 18:12.130
Conversation never
solves anything.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.300
Why, you little...

19:28.860 --> 19:29.830
What the hell?

19:54.630 --> 19:55.900
You're here.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.500
Come help me.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.000
Are you by yourself again?

20:03.200 --> 20:05.230
I told you to hire someone.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.730
No one cares about
an old fellow like me.

20:14.600 --> 20:17.030
You really find this enjoyable?

20:17.030 --> 20:18.600
Of course I do.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.230
I plant it, grow it,
pick it, then eat it.

20:22.230 --> 20:24.560
You buy vegetables
at the store, don't you?

20:24.560 --> 20:28.030
My taste isn't refined enough
to know the difference.

20:28.030 --> 20:30.560
Do you know what's nice about
home-grown vegetables?

20:31.160 --> 20:33.260
They're free of chemicals?

20:34.160 --> 20:36.760
No, I use a ton
of chemicals.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.800
That's why they've
grown so big.

20:42.100 --> 20:47.500
If you buy vegetables,
you throw away what's left.

20:48.100 --> 20:49.030
Sure.

20:49.460 --> 20:56.000
But if you grow them, you give
what's left to other people.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.530
- Isn't that funny?
- I guess you're right.

20:58.960 --> 21:01.800
That's how the world works.

21:01.800 --> 21:05.260
You should only grow
what you need.

21:05.260 --> 21:07.330
Then, you'll cherish what's left.

21:30.230 --> 21:33.200
That light fixture
cost a billion won.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.160
The entire thing is
made of gold.

21:35.160 --> 21:37.530
You put a lot of
money into this place.

21:37.530 --> 21:41.330
To make something great,
you need to put in time or money.

21:41.330 --> 21:43.160
I'm putting in both.

21:43.160 --> 21:46.300
- Is it solid gold?
- No, just the outer plate.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.900
Gil-suk...

22:00.460 --> 22:01.400
Yes, sir?

22:01.960 --> 22:04.000
Do you know
what 'Asra' means?

22:04.830 --> 22:07.600
It's what Gangneung
used to be called, right?

22:07.600 --> 22:09.700
Just look at it.

22:09.700 --> 22:12.630
It means 'dizzyingly vast'.

22:15.230 --> 22:20.630
I'm worried that's the case
with this resort, too.

22:23.730 --> 22:27.430
Do you want to run the resort?

22:27.830 --> 22:28.800
Me, sir?

22:30.160 --> 22:33.930
But this resort is in
Chung-sub's territory.

22:33.930 --> 22:37.300
Sometimes, we have to
change our ways.

22:39.060 --> 22:42.430
I don't want any more conflict
with the Gyeongpo gang, sir.

22:42.430 --> 22:44.000
It belongs to all of us, anyway.

22:44.460 --> 22:47.760
I'll just manage
the Taekji territory.

22:47.760 --> 22:51.830
You're soft when
it matters the most.

22:57.760 --> 23:02.960
To tell you the truth, one of
the shareholders is a bit strange.

23:02.960 --> 23:04.330
Shall I give him a beating?

23:04.330 --> 23:06.730
That's not what I meant.

23:09.160 --> 23:10.960
Don't fight.

23:11.530 --> 23:16.100
If you fight, you suffer
whether you win or lose.

23:33.700 --> 23:35.500
How long has it been?

23:36.500 --> 23:38.560
Not even an hour.

23:39.300 --> 23:40.430
Go back to sleep.

24:10.860 --> 24:12.460
Is this where you're staying?

24:15.660 --> 24:17.630
Yeah, for a while.

24:19.660 --> 24:21.330
It doesn't really suit you.

24:23.230 --> 24:24.860
No place does.

24:49.630 --> 24:51.330
What brings you here, sir?

24:53.300 --> 24:59.030
I happened to be in Gangneung,
and I heard you had a new office.

25:02.030 --> 25:03.600
Drink.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.500
I didn't want to come
empty-handed.

25:06.260 --> 25:08.300
Gangneung coffee
tastes great.

25:11.700 --> 25:13.630
I heard about the boss.

25:15.400 --> 25:18.560
I was too busy to
attend his funeral.

25:26.130 --> 25:29.730
You left the gang, so
there was no need for that.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.000
It's fine.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.800
Thank you for saying that.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.830
The kid who killed
him was in debt.

25:46.400 --> 25:51.700
It's strange that he handed
over the shares to you.

25:51.700 --> 25:54.860
It's only natural to suspect
the new shareholder.

25:54.860 --> 25:58.860
But who would
be this brave?

26:00.730 --> 26:07.700
I want to kill or maim
the bastard who did it.

26:07.700 --> 26:12.430
Then, I'll be able to give
the boss a proper send-off.

26:15.830 --> 26:16.800
Then...

26:17.830 --> 26:21.900
Go do that, instead of
just talking about it.

26:31.200 --> 26:38.200
Across the rooms, restaurants and hallway
there will be a club and a casino.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.630
We're trying to get a permit
to run the casino.

26:42.630 --> 26:43.660
Sir...

26:46.630 --> 26:49.130
Stop right there.

26:49.130 --> 26:50.860
You can't come in here.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.760
Let me finally introduce myself.

26:58.230 --> 26:59.960
I'm Lee Min-suk.

27:34.160 --> 27:35.800
I know who you are.

27:36.500 --> 27:38.860
But what brings you here?

27:39.530 --> 27:43.130
I haven't received
the updated blueprint.

27:43.130 --> 27:45.800
I'd like to see it.

27:48.860 --> 27:51.160
Why would you be
interested in that?

27:54.830 --> 27:56.200
Did you eat?

28:17.960 --> 28:22.760
I heard my men's drugs caused
problems in your family.

28:22.760 --> 28:25.460
They were just trying
to earn some cash.

28:25.460 --> 28:26.760
I apologize.

28:28.260 --> 28:30.260
Are you close to
the Gyeongpo Gang?

28:30.260 --> 28:31.300
No.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.960
I've never met them myself.

28:36.260 --> 28:37.430
I see.

28:37.430 --> 28:39.930
What's a drug dealer doing
all the way out here?

28:42.600 --> 28:49.560
If we're going to do business together,
I need to know your history.

28:59.660 --> 29:02.360
Don't you know
the times we're living in?

29:03.100 --> 29:05.060
You can't smoke
inside an eatery.

29:05.660 --> 29:08.730
Have a problem with that?
Should I put it out?

29:10.830 --> 29:14.260
I do have a problem with that,
but knock yourself out.

29:16.800 --> 29:20.900
I'm not involved with drugs.
I'm a debt collector.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.900
I heard you sell off people
who can't pay their debts.

29:24.900 --> 29:27.160
They need to settle their debts.

29:27.160 --> 29:29.160
Even if they don't
have the money.

29:29.800 --> 29:31.160
Exactly.

29:31.960 --> 29:35.530
Why would you choose
such a dangerous path?

29:38.960 --> 29:43.500
Everything in this world is
already owned by someone.

29:44.100 --> 29:46.200
So, I have two options.

29:46.200 --> 29:53.160
Either kill and steal, or do something
too dangerous that others don’t do.

29:53.160 --> 29:56.000
That's the only way
a guy like me can get by.

30:02.900 --> 30:05.930
Hey, I heard you're a mean one.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.360
Don't worry, I don't
attack just anyone.

30:12.360 --> 30:16.030
Is that a knife
in your back pocket?

30:17.560 --> 30:20.500
I guess you're not
used to seeing it.

30:20.500 --> 30:22.860
I'm just repulsed.

30:22.860 --> 30:25.000
Why do you live like that?

30:25.560 --> 30:27.400
Don't waste your
energy like this.

30:28.030 --> 30:31.330
You won't have enough
when you actually need it.

30:39.860 --> 30:41.630
Don't be so scared.

30:42.260 --> 30:44.960
You were hasty
getting a new office.

30:45.760 --> 30:49.030
Do you want me to work
out on the streets?

30:49.030 --> 30:51.060
That's exactly why I'm
calling you hasty.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.960
You can buy shares
in the resort, sure.

30:55.960 --> 30:58.030
But you can't interfere
in its management.

30:58.960 --> 31:02.630
You mean I can't get involved in business.

31:03.100 --> 31:04.630
I'm the second
largest shareholder.

31:06.260 --> 31:10.300
Let me be honest with you.

31:10.300 --> 31:13.330
I don't want to work with
a bunch of drug dealers.

31:13.330 --> 31:15.560
Second largest sharholder, so what?

31:15.560 --> 31:17.400
We are the largest shareholder.

31:19.130 --> 31:23.130
Unless you buy more shares
and take our spot

31:23.130 --> 31:25.260
you can't meddle
with its management.

31:25.730 --> 31:27.000
Isn't that right?

31:28.800 --> 31:30.260
Am I being unreasonable?

31:32.200 --> 31:33.200
Fine.

31:33.800 --> 31:37.860
I guess I should listen to
the largest shareholder.

31:40.660 --> 31:41.630
Good.

31:42.360 --> 31:44.730
I guess it's settled, then.

31:44.730 --> 31:45.760
Eat up.

31:45.760 --> 31:47.500
Our talk is over,
so I'm leaving.

32:15.800 --> 32:18.700
Did you chat with them?
What were they like?

32:18.700 --> 32:21.000
They're so unlikable.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.260
Should we kick their asses?

32:23.930 --> 32:25.460
Leave them.

32:25.460 --> 32:27.630
Their life seems hard, anyways.

32:28.630 --> 32:30.400
We shouldn't fight them.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.330
Share a meal with
them sometime.

32:32.330 --> 32:33.130
Yes, sir.

32:38.100 --> 32:39.500
Let's drink.

32:41.600 --> 32:43.600
Why is there
only rabbit food?

32:44.700 --> 32:46.200
Where's the meat?

32:47.030 --> 32:50.430
- Welcome, sir.
- Good to see you.

32:51.560 --> 32:52.530
Thanks for coming.

32:54.130 --> 32:55.300
Thank you, sir.

32:56.530 --> 32:58.500
- Thank you so much.
- Grab a seat.

32:58.500 --> 32:59.900
Hello, Lieutenant.

32:59.900 --> 33:04.330
- I didn't think you'd come.
- Of course I came.

33:04.330 --> 33:05.700
I thought you were busy.

33:05.700 --> 33:07.660
- Who's that?
- Thank you for coming.

33:07.660 --> 33:11.360
If it isn't Lieutenant Cho,
the star detective.

33:11.360 --> 33:13.260
How have you been?

33:13.260 --> 33:14.430
You're not attending
the ceremony, are you?

33:14.430 --> 33:15.760
Welcome, sir.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.960
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

33:17.960 --> 33:18.860
Welcome.

33:26.400 --> 33:28.960
What the hell are you doing?

33:28.960 --> 33:30.560
Could I ask the same thing?

33:30.560 --> 33:33.330
I never imagined
you'd do this to me.

33:33.330 --> 33:35.830
Sir, we're having
a celebration.

33:35.830 --> 33:38.030
A celebration, you say?

33:38.030 --> 33:40.430
You mean this idiot?

33:43.730 --> 33:46.230
Is the boss handing
you the resort?

33:48.130 --> 33:49.600
He did offer it.

33:52.360 --> 33:53.500
And?

33:53.500 --> 33:55.300
I refused.

33:55.960 --> 33:57.060
I see.

33:58.100 --> 34:01.560
Then, why do you keep
hanging around the site?

34:01.560 --> 34:04.760
Sir, you're going too far.

34:05.430 --> 34:06.860
You bastard...

34:06.860 --> 34:09.530
Have you lost your mind?

34:12.429 --> 34:15.360
What the hell are you
doing at my wedding?

34:16.159 --> 34:18.400
How can you do this?

34:18.400 --> 34:22.900
I starved myself to get
into this wedding dress!

34:24.600 --> 34:25.960
This is embarrassing.

34:26.900 --> 34:30.659
Don't do this.
Not today.

34:37.400 --> 34:40.699
Here's your wedding gift.

34:55.060 --> 34:57.560
Get back to your jobs.

35:15.600 --> 35:19.930
If my head moves
while I swing, hit me.

35:19.930 --> 35:20.860
Yes, sir.

35:24.300 --> 35:26.360
You son of a bitch.

35:26.360 --> 35:28.830
I didn't mean it,
you crazy bastard!

35:28.830 --> 35:29.600
I'm sorry, sir.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.730
- I'll smash your head in.
- I'm so sorry.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.260
You bastard.

35:33.260 --> 35:35.230
Get that thing out of my face.

35:35.230 --> 35:36.800
- I'm so sorry.
- Sir.

35:37.360 --> 35:39.330
Bring him over here.

35:39.330 --> 35:40.100
Get lost.

35:47.630 --> 35:50.130
I thought I was
meeting with Mr. Kim.

35:50.830 --> 35:57.300
Only a president gets to
meet with another president.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.260
Nice shot!

36:04.430 --> 36:07.500
Have you heard of
'Songs of Gwandong'?

36:08.830 --> 36:09.730
No.

36:09.730 --> 36:11.930
Just as I expected.

36:11.930 --> 36:14.030
It's a super old poem.

36:14.030 --> 36:17.530
It says that this is the most
beautiful place in Gangwon-do.

36:19.260 --> 36:26.700
It's the best place to enjoy a drink
while looking at the moon.

36:27.030 --> 36:29.360
That's the life I want.

36:29.860 --> 36:32.630
And that's the life
I want for my son.

36:33.130 --> 36:34.700
It's heaven on earth.

36:39.460 --> 36:44.100
Wow, I should just
quit right now!

36:44.100 --> 36:45.530
That was amazing!

36:45.530 --> 36:49.260
I don't think I need
any more practice.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.230
Hey...

36:52.230 --> 36:55.500
I know our bosses have
some business conflict.

36:55.500 --> 37:02.460
But let's leave the business
up to them and try to get along.

37:04.600 --> 37:06.230
I get what you're saying.

37:06.760 --> 37:08.930
But that's easier
said than done.

37:08.930 --> 37:10.930
A man of reason, huh?

37:10.930 --> 37:13.900
I know it won't be easy,
but we should at least try.

37:13.900 --> 37:18.360
I heard you've had
a lot of hardship.

37:18.360 --> 37:19.830
I understand that.

37:19.830 --> 37:21.460
So, just take things easy.

37:22.360 --> 37:27.460
You understand
the hardship I've had?

37:27.460 --> 37:29.700
Did you have it easy?

37:32.060 --> 37:34.260
I did some manual labor
when I was young.

37:34.260 --> 37:36.500
See, I was right.

37:37.160 --> 37:39.930
I worked for a month
and got my first paycheck.

37:39.930 --> 37:44.000
I realized how hard
it is to make money.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.300
You're right, it is hard.

37:48.030 --> 37:52.700
That night, I had dinner with a guy
who did manual labor for 30 years.

37:52.700 --> 37:55.430
I told him I was amazed.

37:55.430 --> 37:58.460
'How have you been
doing this for 30 years?'

37:58.460 --> 38:01.700
This is what he said.

38:02.660 --> 38:05.930
'You know nothing.'

38:06.560 --> 38:09.830
He doesn't sound like
a very nice man.

38:10.530 --> 38:13.360
I had degraded him.

38:15.700 --> 38:21.200
I'd never been disgusted by people
or lost a co-worker in an accident.

38:21.200 --> 38:25.160
I'd never been ignored by
someone younger than me.

38:25.160 --> 38:27.130
I was just a kid.

38:29.260 --> 38:31.430
Yet, I claimed to
understand his life.

38:36.960 --> 38:40.700
It's insulting to tell people
you understand them.

38:46.800 --> 38:50.900
Hey, do you find
that insulting?

38:50.900 --> 38:53.860
I don't get what
he's saying at all.

38:54.500 --> 38:55.700
Pack everything up.

38:56.730 --> 38:58.200
Damn it.

38:58.200 --> 38:59.960
Don't you dare look at me.

39:07.230 --> 39:09.300
Can I get some raw fish?

39:09.300 --> 39:11.900
I'll prepare it right away.

39:19.800 --> 39:22.130
What an easy life you lead.

39:22.830 --> 39:25.430
Why do I sense
scorn in your voice?

39:25.430 --> 39:27.960
This is no time to be
enjoying raw fish.

39:27.960 --> 39:30.560
Gil-suk is about to
usurp the resort.

39:30.560 --> 39:35.060
Well, he's smart and skilled.

39:35.800 --> 39:38.960
Hierarchy and territory
need to be respected.

39:38.960 --> 39:44.630
The boss is passing on
his business to us.

39:45.860 --> 39:48.630
So, it's up to him to decide.

39:48.630 --> 39:49.860
How ridiculous.

39:52.360 --> 39:57.100
You're not going to do
anything about it, then?

39:57.100 --> 40:01.700
Sometimes, things are
solved by doing nothing.

40:03.930 --> 40:05.160
Damn it...

40:07.160 --> 40:09.060
Enjoy your raw fish.
I'm leaving.

40:09.930 --> 40:10.960
Chung-sub.

40:12.660 --> 40:18.530
Don't go out to sea when
there's a storm brewing.

40:20.930 --> 40:23.860
We never let the weather
forecast dictate our lives.

40:39.600 --> 40:41.360
You should get some sleep.

40:41.360 --> 40:42.930
You look tired.

40:45.930 --> 40:47.600
Are you worried about me?

40:48.600 --> 40:52.230
Am I not allowed to do that?

40:57.000 --> 40:58.530
You're always like that.

41:05.460 --> 41:09.560
Whenever I try to get close,
you push me away.

41:17.230 --> 41:20.460
What are you going to do?

41:24.800 --> 41:27.100
How will you
settle your debt?

41:27.100 --> 41:30.460
You're using your body
just to pay off the interest.

41:35.200 --> 41:37.230
Don't you need to live?

41:37.730 --> 41:41.130
Were you just collecting
interest from me?

41:41.700 --> 41:43.330
What are we, then?

41:53.230 --> 41:54.560
What are we?

41:56.560 --> 41:57.860
Tell me.

42:01.600 --> 42:02.630
Hmm?

42:24.960 --> 42:27.100
Think you can handle me?

42:49.530 --> 42:51.360
What brings you here?

42:52.130 --> 42:55.660
I was in the area,
so I dropped by.

42:55.660 --> 42:57.860
I thought you'd
like some help.

42:58.430 --> 42:59.800
No, thanks.

43:00.730 --> 43:03.030
This is a job for someone
with experience.

43:04.600 --> 43:06.360
It doesn't seem that hard.

43:27.760 --> 43:30.900
I guess you're used to
getting your hands dirty.

43:30.900 --> 43:32.660
You've had it rough.

43:33.230 --> 43:37.700
Not as rough as
the people that died.

43:38.200 --> 43:41.330
There must be a lot
of blood on your hands.

43:42.700 --> 43:45.000
If you use pens,
you get ink.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.430
But if you use knives,
you get blood.

43:48.560 --> 43:50.360
Not anymore.

43:51.060 --> 43:56.330
Nowadays, pens get you blood.
Knives just get you jail time.

43:57.130 --> 43:58.900
You're right.

43:58.900 --> 44:01.130
The world has changed
for the worse.

44:02.360 --> 44:06.100
In the past, if you wanted
to eat a chicken

44:06.100 --> 44:12.260
you had to strangle it, gut it
and pluck its feathers yourself.

44:13.100 --> 44:15.800
But nowadays, you just have
to go to a supermarket.

44:15.800 --> 44:17.530
What a convenient world.

44:19.360 --> 44:22.560
But there's something
people shouldn't forget.

44:22.560 --> 44:26.260
Whenever someone
eats a chicken...

44:26.260 --> 44:31.360
someone else had to
strangle and gut it.

44:33.730 --> 44:38.730
People keep themselves busy to
forget about that stuff.

44:38.730 --> 44:41.160
Have you ever
killed someone?

44:49.500 --> 44:52.960
Why would you ask me
something like that?

44:53.600 --> 44:56.560
Gangneung may be
a rural town

44:56.560 --> 45:00.860
but it's hard to get to the top
without killing someone.

45:00.860 --> 45:04.560
You seem like such
a nice person.

45:05.230 --> 45:10.460
If I had killed someone, would that
make me the same as you?

45:11.560 --> 45:12.730
I'm not sure.

45:13.730 --> 45:15.800
That's what I'd like to know.

45:16.730 --> 45:18.360
It's simple.

45:19.100 --> 45:25.700
A man who killed 100 people isn't
the same as a man who killed 1 person.

45:26.760 --> 45:30.230
The scope of things
always matters.

45:30.700 --> 45:33.600
That determines the difference
between individuals.

45:36.230 --> 45:38.200
Why are you here?

45:39.530 --> 45:44.260
I had a talk with Mr. Kim
about managing the resort.

45:45.230 --> 45:47.600
I heard you two
came to an agreement.

45:47.600 --> 45:50.160
Is there something else
you want to say to me?

45:53.360 --> 45:56.330
No, I have nothing else to say.

46:10.230 --> 46:12.130
Not bad for a retiree.

46:12.130 --> 46:14.860
You've got a long way to go!

46:50.130 --> 46:52.960
What would I do
with that now?

46:53.830 --> 46:56.260
It'll only be pitiful.

47:00.060 --> 47:01.500
It's time for you to go.

47:03.060 --> 47:05.200
You shouldn't...

47:36.700 --> 47:38.330
You bastard.

48:02.000 --> 48:02.900
Sir...

48:05.400 --> 48:07.300
- Sir, you can't...
- Get off of me!

48:07.300 --> 48:09.360
- What are you doing?
- Let go!

48:09.360 --> 48:11.030
You can't go in there!

48:12.200 --> 48:13.030
Excuse me!

48:54.900 --> 48:58.500
We did our best, but
he lost too much blood.

48:58.500 --> 49:01.460
I'm sorry, but he passed away.

49:19.200 --> 49:20.460
Mr. Kim...

49:27.160 --> 49:28.400
What are you doing?

49:29.530 --> 49:30.900
You can't be here!

49:31.730 --> 49:34.660
Who killed him, you bitch?

49:38.000 --> 49:40.160
I'm here because I did it.

49:40.160 --> 49:42.500
You need to leave!

49:42.500 --> 49:43.830
Get off!

49:44.900 --> 49:48.330
You're just a nobody who
came out of nowhere!

49:48.330 --> 49:50.130
You can't have killed our boss!

49:51.500 --> 49:55.900
It's not that hard to
kill an old man.

49:55.900 --> 49:58.100
You fucking bitch!

49:58.100 --> 50:00.460
He was almost 70!

50:00.460 --> 50:04.000
Why would you do
such a thing?

50:04.000 --> 50:05.200
Tell me!

50:06.500 --> 50:07.360
Fuck...

50:13.160 --> 50:15.030
I did it to survive.

50:16.030 --> 50:17.660
I'll do anything to survive.

50:19.430 --> 50:23.030
What the fuck!

51:14.360 --> 51:17.530
She was in debt.

51:42.700 --> 51:45.600
Dongbu Credit was
collecting from her.

51:46.600 --> 51:48.030
That's Lee Min-suk's company.

52:16.160 --> 52:18.430
I understand how you feel.

52:18.430 --> 52:20.760
But trust me and be patient.

52:20.760 --> 52:21.860
Okay?

52:34.630 --> 52:37.430
Just sit around and wait?

52:40.360 --> 52:44.060
We need to handle this
ourselves, right now!

52:45.360 --> 52:47.760
The boss told us not to fight.

52:48.700 --> 52:50.500
He's dead now!

52:52.800 --> 52:54.400
That's why he died!

52:59.400 --> 53:00.460
Hey...

53:19.800 --> 53:20.760
Welcome.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.030
Kim, you're here.

54:02.830 --> 54:04.560
I've heard a lot about you.

54:05.900 --> 54:09.000
This is Shin from
Chungsong Planning.

54:17.460 --> 54:19.000
Chungsong Planning?

54:20.460 --> 54:23.030
Didn't Lee Min-suk
screw you guys over?

54:24.200 --> 54:26.700
President Nam died, right?

54:26.700 --> 54:30.400
Kim, come on.
Be more tactful.

54:31.130 --> 54:32.360
Let's get this over with.

54:33.060 --> 54:36.060
You're quite impatient.

54:36.060 --> 54:39.130
That's right, so speed it up.

54:41.930 --> 54:43.060
All right.

54:44.060 --> 54:48.900
Lieutenant Cho is preparing
to catch Lee Min-suk.

54:48.900 --> 54:51.660
When Lee Min-suk and
Dongbu Development are gone

54:51.660 --> 54:54.630
you'll need a new investor.

54:54.630 --> 54:55.900
Well...

54:57.630 --> 55:00.060
That's all business talk.

55:01.300 --> 55:03.700
Why is the police
getting involved?

55:04.060 --> 55:07.860
I think you've misunderstood.

55:07.860 --> 55:10.730
No, I understand everything.

55:15.700 --> 55:18.730
It's bad enough
that you lost.

55:18.730 --> 55:22.560
Now, you're asking
around for help.

55:23.300 --> 55:24.560
That's pathetic.

55:27.160 --> 55:28.630
Chief...

55:30.600 --> 55:34.830
My boss's grave is still fresh.

55:36.260 --> 55:38.030
Kim, don't be so...

55:38.900 --> 55:45.500
Mr. Kim, I get what
you're trying say.

55:45.500 --> 55:47.030
This was rude of me.

55:49.060 --> 55:50.460
At least you know.

55:54.130 --> 55:55.900
I'll foot the bill.

55:57.000 --> 55:58.600
Enjoy your meal.

56:08.430 --> 56:10.630
Sir, welcome.

56:10.930 --> 56:12.130
Find anything?

56:12.130 --> 56:14.230
No, so far we just
beat them up.

56:14.860 --> 56:18.900
You need to get answers
before beating them up.

56:19.930 --> 56:20.960
Idiots.

56:26.760 --> 56:29.730
Why are they upside down?
That causes nausea.

56:29.730 --> 56:31.100
Are you nauseous?

56:31.100 --> 56:32.400
I meant me.

56:43.300 --> 56:44.760
Hold on...

56:55.360 --> 56:59.160
We're not used to doing
something like this.

57:00.800 --> 57:01.930
We can tell.

57:02.800 --> 57:07.700
If you're going to
beat people up

57:07.700 --> 57:11.360
at least explain why,
you bastards.

57:12.000 --> 57:15.030
I heard your mom
has stomach cancer.

57:15.030 --> 57:16.730
Did she eat too
much spicy food?

57:17.430 --> 57:18.760
What the hell...

57:18.760 --> 57:25.700
My mom's cancer is none of
your fucking business.

57:27.530 --> 57:30.730
You son of a bitch!

57:31.800 --> 57:33.260
Grab his head.

57:35.830 --> 57:41.900
If you touch my mom,
I'll kill every single one of you!

57:41.900 --> 57:45.500
Her hospital bills
must be expensive.

57:45.500 --> 57:47.160
Is Lee Min-suk
helping you out?

57:49.400 --> 57:53.500
We'll pay for her surgery
and get her a caretaker.

57:54.060 --> 57:56.500
- How's that?
- What?

57:58.860 --> 58:01.600
Just give us
the time and place.

58:01.600 --> 58:03.130
That's all we need.

58:13.500 --> 58:16.630
Lieutenant, we got
the time and place.

58:18.530 --> 58:19.630
Gather round.

58:44.730 --> 58:46.330
I'll be right there.

58:46.700 --> 58:47.860
((중국어))

58:53.530 --> 58:54.900
((중국어))

58:56.700 --> 58:57.930
((중국어))

59:32.130 --> 59:33.530
They're on the move, Lieutenant.

59:52.160 --> 59:53.530
What is it?

59:53.530 --> 59:54.900
It's started.

59:54.900 --> 59:58.700
If Lieutenant Cho fails,
I'm going in myself.

59:59.330 --> 1:00:00.160
Okay.

1:00:07.660 --> 1:00:09.230
Stop drinking.

1:00:09.830 --> 1:00:11.660
Is it only me who's worried?

1:00:13.200 --> 1:00:15.100
Damn it...

1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:21.430
We're being tailed.

1:00:35.430 --> 1:00:39.560
Lee, the police is following us.

1:01:01.300 --> 1:01:04.530
We're following Horse, Elephant
and Cannon into the marketplace.

1:01:08.030 --> 1:01:11.460
Chariot, Guard and Soldier are
entering through the back gates.

1:01:24.730 --> 1:01:27.700
Cannon made a turn.
We'll follow him.

1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:45.500
Horse and Elephant are heading to
the center of the marketplace.

1:01:54.900 --> 1:01:56.760
Horse and Elephant split up.

1:01:56.760 --> 1:01:57.900
We'll follow Horse.

1:02:00.430 --> 1:02:02.130
Team 7, follow Elephant.

1:02:05.400 --> 1:02:08.600
Guard split up with
Chariot and Soldier.

1:02:09.400 --> 1:02:12.360
Guard is by himself now.

1:02:16.100 --> 1:02:17.660
Team 2, follow Guard.

1:02:27.730 --> 1:02:29.460
Chariot and Soldier
split up, too.

1:02:31.860 --> 1:02:33.560
He's headed for
the rendezvous point.

1:02:34.500 --> 1:02:36.100
He's near the rendezvous point.

1:03:00.530 --> 1:03:02.200
We got Chariot and Soldier.

1:03:13.660 --> 1:03:15.900
They're at the rendezvous point.

1:03:15.900 --> 1:03:17.360
They fell for our trap.

1:03:30.160 --> 1:03:32.830
Stop right there!

1:03:47.230 --> 1:03:48.100
Hold it!

1:03:49.830 --> 1:03:54.000
- Stay still!
- We caught all of them!

1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:58.830
One will have drugs, and
the other will have cash.

1:03:58.830 --> 1:04:00.530
Search every inch.

1:04:00.730 --> 1:04:03.700
Don't be so rough!
That hurts!

1:04:06.300 --> 1:04:07.930
- Don't move!
- Hold still!

1:04:11.730 --> 1:04:12.760
What's that?

1:04:13.900 --> 1:04:15.560
Do you like pu-erh tea?

1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:17.560
Tea?

1:04:20.900 --> 1:04:23.500
Let me explain.

1:04:23.500 --> 1:04:28.330
Chinese people love tea.

1:04:28.330 --> 1:04:32.900
So, I thought I'd let them taste
the famous Gangneung coffee.

1:04:35.530 --> 1:04:39.800
If you want some,
you can have it.

1:04:39.800 --> 1:04:42.600
Think of it as a present.

1:04:44.930 --> 1:04:46.560
Idiots.

1:04:47.300 --> 1:04:48.330
Let go of me!

1:06:05.100 --> 1:06:07.800
Sir, I got the goods.

1:06:09.430 --> 1:06:10.860
Time for some offense.

1:06:13.900 --> 1:06:16.060
I knew this would happen.

1:06:16.060 --> 1:06:17.560
They didn't get Lee Min-suk.

1:06:20.300 --> 1:06:23.260
- Get ready.
- Yes, sir.

1:06:24.260 --> 1:06:25.830
Let's do this!

1:06:33.460 --> 1:06:35.060
What are you waiting for?

1:06:36.600 --> 1:06:37.630
Aren't you coming?

1:06:46.530 --> 1:06:47.230
What's going on?

1:06:52.160 --> 1:06:53.160
Chung-sub!

1:07:06.660 --> 1:07:09.500
Are you serious?

1:07:19.700 --> 1:07:22.460
- What the hell?
- Son of a bitch!

1:07:33.500 --> 1:07:34.700
You bastards!

1:07:45.430 --> 1:07:47.000
Take that!

1:08:38.200 --> 1:08:40.830
Stop acting tough.

1:08:40.830 --> 1:08:45.060
You look adorable right now.

1:09:09.800 --> 1:09:10.960
Gil-suk...

1:09:10.960 --> 1:09:13.660
What's going on?
Where are you?

1:09:13.660 --> 1:09:16.200
I never expected
this to happen.

1:09:21.859 --> 1:09:24.130
Stop talking nonsense.
Where are you?

1:09:31.859 --> 1:09:36.600
Not that I cared about
treating you well...

1:09:42.430 --> 1:09:46.330
But I was such
a bastard to you.

1:09:49.260 --> 1:09:50.500
Gil-suk...

1:09:55.160 --> 1:09:56.800
I'm sorry.

1:09:56.800 --> 1:09:59.560
Just answer my damn question!

1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:01.600
Hey, what are you doing?

1:10:04.400 --> 1:10:05.230
Gyeongpo?

1:10:06.600 --> 1:10:07.560
Gyeongpo!

1:11:13.760 --> 1:11:14.960
Mr. Kim...

1:12:07.030 --> 1:12:08.600
Damn it...

1:12:17.660 --> 1:12:19.860
I guess that's it for today.

1:12:33.700 --> 1:12:34.800
Hyung-geun...

1:14:26.060 --> 1:14:27.300
Congratulations.

1:14:27.900 --> 1:14:31.330
It's not really something
to be congratulated.

1:14:31.330 --> 1:14:32.860
What do you mean?

1:14:32.860 --> 1:14:36.560
You don't even
have to give orders.

1:14:36.560 --> 1:14:42.130
Your henchmen and debtors
kill your enemies for you.

1:14:42.130 --> 1:14:44.360
So, you get cleared
of all charges.

1:14:44.860 --> 1:14:48.560
Isn't that something
to be congratulated?

1:14:52.360 --> 1:14:54.060
Are you here to
pick a fight?

1:14:54.730 --> 1:14:57.960
I know you bought off
Choi Mu-sang.

1:15:05.030 --> 1:15:10.730
I never bought him off.
I just asked him a question.

1:15:11.660 --> 1:15:15.560
'Do you really want
Kim Gil-suk to own the resort?'

1:15:18.260 --> 1:15:20.600
Do you know
where Mr. Kim is?

1:15:21.400 --> 1:15:23.730
Why do you ask?

1:15:23.730 --> 1:15:26.430
He's still the largest shareholder.

1:15:26.430 --> 1:15:30.230
It's difficult to do
business without him.

1:15:34.700 --> 1:15:39.500
If you hear anything,
please let me know.

1:17:26.860 --> 1:17:30.400
Did you gain weight?

1:17:30.400 --> 1:17:32.500
That's hard to do in prison.

1:17:35.200 --> 1:17:38.000
You regret it, don't you?

1:17:40.560 --> 1:17:42.730
If that's all, I'm leaving.

1:17:42.730 --> 1:17:44.130
Sit your ass back down.

1:17:45.230 --> 1:17:47.660
Do you think I came
here out of boredom?

1:17:54.530 --> 1:17:59.000
If you admit that
you didn't do it

1:17:59.660 --> 1:18:01.700
I'll take care of everything.

1:18:02.700 --> 1:18:06.660
Then, what about my debt?

1:18:06.660 --> 1:18:09.260
I'll introduce you
to a lawyer.

1:18:09.260 --> 1:18:12.060
Declare bankruptcy
and get financial aid.

1:18:12.060 --> 1:18:13.160
Bankruptcy?

1:18:14.260 --> 1:18:17.130
You think he'll allow that?

1:18:17.130 --> 1:18:19.660
He'll find me and
put me to work.

1:18:21.030 --> 1:18:23.830
Then, he'll sell my organs.

1:18:28.460 --> 1:18:33.030
Mister, do you know
why I'm still alive?

1:18:34.230 --> 1:18:36.030
It's because of my beauty.

1:18:37.160 --> 1:18:39.200
Good for you.

1:18:41.930 --> 1:18:43.560
So, just leave.

1:18:45.300 --> 1:18:48.800
Even without your testimony,
Lee Min-suk will get arrested.

1:18:48.800 --> 1:18:50.400
On multiple charges.

1:18:51.700 --> 1:18:54.260
I'll make him pay
for his greed.

1:18:57.700 --> 1:18:59.960
You think it's greed?

1:19:00.560 --> 1:19:01.600
What do you mean?

1:19:11.300 --> 1:19:12.660
Good luck.

1:19:13.530 --> 1:19:14.930
I'll be rooting for you.

1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:33.260
This is nice.

1:19:35.600 --> 1:19:37.800
The East Sea is better
than the West Sea.

1:19:38.960 --> 1:19:44.000
I never took time
to enjoy the scenery.

1:19:47.830 --> 1:19:53.630
If this is where I grew up,
would I be any different?

1:19:55.330 --> 1:19:58.130
Seems like Gangneung
suits your taste, sir.

1:20:01.800 --> 1:20:04.460
It's nice, but people are
the same everywhere.

1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:50.930
Do you own this place, too?

1:20:52.700 --> 1:20:56.130
Well, I'm a loyal man.

1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:59.700
I'm even happy to
see your face.

1:20:59.700 --> 1:21:01.560
Maybe all that fighting
lead to attachment.

1:21:02.700 --> 1:21:03.860
Why are you here?

1:21:05.130 --> 1:21:06.160
To negotiate?

1:21:07.630 --> 1:21:09.060
To do business.

1:21:10.360 --> 1:21:12.330
Business, huh?

1:21:12.330 --> 1:21:14.960
You're too hard to get rid of.

1:21:15.600 --> 1:21:18.160
So, let's manage
the resort together.

1:21:18.160 --> 1:21:21.060
I'll take the casino.
You take the club.

1:21:21.060 --> 1:21:23.400
The rest, we'll cut up.

1:21:24.560 --> 1:21:26.730
And share the books.

1:21:44.760 --> 1:21:48.400
You want to act as
if nothing happened?

1:21:49.400 --> 1:21:51.830
Isn't this what you wanted?

1:21:52.760 --> 1:21:56.130
Or, do you want
another knife fight?

1:22:04.530 --> 1:22:07.600
Looks like hardship
made you weak.

1:22:11.300 --> 1:22:18.200
Even with a knife,
you couldn't kill me properly.

1:22:18.700 --> 1:22:21.230
Do you want another chance?

1:22:24.300 --> 1:22:27.600
Most people get scared
after being stabbed.

1:22:27.600 --> 1:22:29.000
But you seem fine.

1:22:33.360 --> 1:22:36.200
You put a hole in my stomach,
so of course I'm scared.

1:22:37.260 --> 1:22:42.360
But all that hardship made
me realize something.

1:22:47.630 --> 1:22:50.930
You're also scared of me, right?

1:22:54.400 --> 1:22:57.700
But after what happened,
it's hard to trust you.

1:23:00.830 --> 1:23:05.660
When we first talked,
you agreed to back off.

1:23:06.800 --> 1:23:11.060
If you weren't happy,
you should have persuaded me.

1:23:12.400 --> 1:23:15.400
You tried to get the police
to arrest me, too.

1:23:16.030 --> 1:23:17.660
Talk means nothing.

1:23:18.860 --> 1:23:23.200
What about this conversation?

1:23:24.130 --> 1:23:25.430
Does it mean anything?

1:23:26.760 --> 1:23:31.760
In this world,
words are meaningless.

1:23:33.160 --> 1:23:38.530
Claim that you're in this together,
but then eat your friend's heart.

1:23:40.230 --> 1:23:41.730
That's what humans do.

1:23:43.630 --> 1:23:45.760
So, stop talking
and just do it.

1:23:46.730 --> 1:23:48.500
Let's wait and see.

1:24:26.660 --> 1:24:28.600
I heard you met with
Lee Min-suk.

1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:32.830
How the hell
do you know that?

1:24:33.730 --> 1:24:36.300
What are you planning?

1:24:37.930 --> 1:24:39.360
Nothing much.

1:24:41.530 --> 1:24:45.530
I want to do business like
these bastards from Seoul.

1:24:45.530 --> 1:24:48.000
You're going to run
around with a knife, too?

1:24:55.760 --> 1:24:58.560
Do you know why
I work this hard?

1:24:58.560 --> 1:25:04.030
After I retire, I want to enjoy
a relaxing life here.

1:25:04.030 --> 1:25:06.760
But I'm going to
need a friend.

1:25:07.560 --> 1:25:10.230
If you run around
stabbing people...

1:25:11.860 --> 1:25:14.300
I won't be able to see you.

1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:19.800
This is no time for
such daydreams.

1:25:19.800 --> 1:25:23.400
No, it's the perfect
time for daydreams.

1:25:24.030 --> 1:25:27.700
You can't survive in this world
without a little romance.

1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:33.260
Don't be ridiculous.
Romance is long dead.

1:25:33.830 --> 1:25:35.800
It's still alive, you idiot.

1:25:44.060 --> 1:25:45.130
Gil-suk.

1:25:46.330 --> 1:25:47.600
I'm the police.

1:25:48.860 --> 1:25:52.260
I can't make exceptions
if you break the law.

1:25:52.260 --> 1:25:53.630
That's just fine.

1:25:54.830 --> 1:25:58.830
You do your job,
and I'll do mine.

1:25:58.830 --> 1:25:59.760
Gil-suk!

1:26:01.560 --> 1:26:06.000
Let me handle it.
Don't do this, okay?

1:26:09.160 --> 1:26:11.060
I trust you.

1:26:14.300 --> 1:26:16.530
But I don't trust your words.

1:26:34.330 --> 1:26:35.130
Sit.

1:26:44.900 --> 1:26:48.130
You make me leave, and then
you make me come back.

1:26:48.130 --> 1:26:51.560
It seems like you can't
make up your mind.

1:27:01.600 --> 1:27:05.000
I heard what happened.

1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:06.600
Things aren't looking good, right?

1:27:07.160 --> 1:27:10.560
There's no need to comfort me.

1:27:13.030 --> 1:27:16.830
Why did you want to see me?

1:27:23.630 --> 1:27:25.160
I'm going to kill
Lee Min-suk.

1:27:30.060 --> 1:27:31.430
Will you help?

1:27:38.360 --> 1:27:42.060
Why should I help you?

1:27:42.900 --> 1:27:45.960
Don't you have unfinished
business with him, too?

1:27:53.830 --> 1:27:54.800
No.

1:27:56.300 --> 1:28:01.800
You lost, so you're
asking around for help.

1:28:01.800 --> 1:28:04.160
Who would trust you?

1:28:04.160 --> 1:28:08.660
He killed my boss,
yet I did nothing.

1:28:08.660 --> 1:28:10.630
That wasn't because
I'm an idiot.

1:28:10.630 --> 1:28:14.360
You can't go crazy while
dealing with a madman.

1:28:15.200 --> 1:28:18.830
It's not as simple as
paying off the police.

1:28:20.500 --> 1:28:24.360
In this war, I'll end up
doing all the hard work.

1:28:25.100 --> 1:28:29.800
But I'll only get to be the resort's
second largest shareholder.

1:28:29.800 --> 1:28:30.630
No.

1:28:31.930 --> 1:28:36.000
I'll let you become
the largest shareholder.

1:28:37.660 --> 1:28:39.930
You take my shares.

1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:42.560
I'll take Lee's shares.

1:28:43.400 --> 1:28:46.230
The moment he dies...

1:28:46.230 --> 1:28:48.800
Mr. Shin, you'll become
the largest shareholder.

1:28:51.400 --> 1:28:52.460
How's that?

1:28:59.160 --> 1:29:00.960
Mr. Kim...

1:29:02.630 --> 1:29:05.460
You've never wielded
a knife before.

1:29:07.730 --> 1:29:09.300
Are you sure
you can handle it?

1:29:46.860 --> 1:29:47.760
Sir...

1:29:51.300 --> 1:29:55.030
Kim Gil-suk gave his shares
to Chungsong Planning.

1:29:55.560 --> 1:29:57.660
They're opening an office
here in Gangneung.

1:30:00.360 --> 1:30:02.500
Should we strike first?

1:30:53.960 --> 1:30:55.130
You're here.

1:30:58.860 --> 1:31:01.260
You're working with
Chungsong Planning?

1:31:03.160 --> 1:31:05.960
You just sit on your ass,
but you hear everything.

1:31:09.030 --> 1:31:13.330
I've heard he's not easy
to work with, either.

1:31:17.230 --> 1:31:18.860
Why did you do it?

1:31:20.460 --> 1:31:22.160
Why, you ask?

1:31:24.360 --> 1:31:27.660
I guess it was greed.

1:31:33.600 --> 1:31:37.230
Do you know how
I became a gangster?

1:31:40.560 --> 1:31:42.760
I was just over 20.

1:31:43.500 --> 1:31:49.900
Some fishermen were auctioning off
the squid they had caught overnight.

1:31:49.900 --> 1:31:54.060
But some guys from Seoul
were causing trouble.

1:31:54.060 --> 1:31:59.900
So, the boss and I
beat them all up.

1:31:59.900 --> 1:32:04.330
And the fishermen
thanked us for it.

1:32:04.330 --> 1:32:08.660
They even treated
us to raw fish.

1:32:10.430 --> 1:32:12.330
That's how I started.

1:32:13.500 --> 1:32:15.360
For a while, things were fine.

1:32:16.500 --> 1:32:24.230
But then, trucks belonging to
big companies started causing trouble.

1:32:25.560 --> 1:32:30.330
This time, we couldn't
beat them all up.

1:32:33.800 --> 1:32:34.800
So...

1:32:36.200 --> 1:32:39.430
We expanded our organization
and founded a company.

1:32:39.430 --> 1:32:41.200
We even made business cards.

1:32:43.500 --> 1:32:47.830
I worked really hard.

1:32:53.000 --> 1:32:54.730
And that resort...

1:32:56.800 --> 1:32:59.900
That big building didn't
just appear out of nowhere.

1:33:00.700 --> 1:33:04.960
It was my dream to
build something like that.

1:33:08.300 --> 1:33:10.000
What do you think?

1:33:12.500 --> 1:33:17.660
Is it greedy of me
to want that?

1:33:19.560 --> 1:33:23.630
I never thought of it as mine.

1:33:24.760 --> 1:33:26.560
It's ours.

1:33:28.630 --> 1:33:32.900
Well, that's the problem.

1:33:34.530 --> 1:33:36.500
There's no such thing as 'ours'.

1:33:36.500 --> 1:33:40.260
It's either yours or mine.

1:33:40.260 --> 1:33:41.330
Can't you...

1:33:43.700 --> 1:33:45.830
Can't you just apologize?

1:33:47.800 --> 1:33:49.000
Apologize?

1:33:52.860 --> 1:33:54.500
You only apologize...

1:33:56.930 --> 1:33:59.160
After you do
something wrong.

1:33:59.700 --> 1:34:03.000
I've done nothing wrong,
so I can't apologize.

1:34:06.600 --> 1:34:07.730
Gil-suk...

1:34:09.800 --> 1:34:12.030
Just do me a favor.

1:34:16.330 --> 1:34:18.530
Don't share it with others.

1:34:22.760 --> 1:34:24.760
It should be all yours.

1:34:51.060 --> 1:34:53.260
I won't apologize, either.

1:36:12.700 --> 1:36:13.860
Bastard!

1:36:15.600 --> 1:36:17.000
- Son of a bitch!
- Stand back.

1:37:09.430 --> 1:37:15.800
You adjusted pretty fast.

1:37:18.100 --> 1:37:20.600
Why did you turn
this place into hell?

1:37:21.830 --> 1:37:23.500
I didn't do anything.

1:37:26.060 --> 1:37:27.860
The world decides
these things.

1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:31.500
People just follow.

1:37:33.200 --> 1:37:34.200
That's right.

1:37:35.130 --> 1:37:37.400
That's why we followed, too.

1:37:37.400 --> 1:37:38.830
Just in time.

1:38:38.100 --> 1:38:42.360
Lee Min-suk, you're under arrest for
conspiracy to murder and drug trafficking.

1:38:47.230 --> 1:38:49.660
How did you get a warrant?

1:38:51.330 --> 1:38:53.300
You won't find anything.

1:38:53.860 --> 1:38:54.760
Arrest him.

1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:58.260
What the hell!

1:39:15.700 --> 1:39:20.160
Is this how you've lived
all these years?

1:39:23.560 --> 1:39:24.530
Yes, sir?

1:39:25.230 --> 1:39:26.800
How did it go?

1:39:26.800 --> 1:39:29.560
- Things are still developing.
- Don't make any mistakes.

1:39:30.060 --> 1:39:33.530
When Lee Min-suk dies,
Kim Gil-suk must die.

1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:43.300
Don't worry, sir.

1:39:47.300 --> 1:39:49.830
Everything's going
according to plan.

1:39:56.560 --> 1:40:00.430
Everyone thinks that
they deserve more.

1:40:00.430 --> 1:40:06.100
If we don't get rid of Kim Gil-suk,
we'll keep fighting over the shares.

1:40:14.630 --> 1:40:20.960
Mr. Kim swallowed his pride
and asked for your help.

1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:22.960
He must trust you.

1:40:24.460 --> 1:40:27.430
What about Lee Min-suk?
Did he trust you, too?

1:40:39.730 --> 1:40:44.030
Let's wrap things up
and go to Mr. Kim.

1:40:57.000 --> 1:40:58.930
You sons of bitches!

1:41:01.030 --> 1:41:02.060
Bastards!

1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:30.730
You're so adorable
for a tough guy.

1:41:30.730 --> 1:41:32.230
Wait...

1:41:33.130 --> 1:41:34.500
Please!

1:41:53.460 --> 1:41:58.330
If you lock me up, Kim Gil-suk
won't have to kill anyone.

1:41:58.330 --> 1:42:01.960
Things will settle
down for a while.

1:42:02.800 --> 1:42:04.200
But...

1:42:05.660 --> 1:42:08.000
This war will break out again.

1:42:08.860 --> 1:42:12.700
You're just making things
more bothersome.

1:42:19.060 --> 1:42:20.130
Lieutenant...

1:42:37.300 --> 1:42:38.560
What are you doing?

1:42:39.900 --> 1:42:44.130
- What about you?
- This is police business.

1:42:44.130 --> 1:42:46.000
No warrant was approved.

1:42:48.300 --> 1:42:50.060
Is that a fake warrant?

1:42:50.430 --> 1:42:56.300
If you don't stop now,
I won't be able to help you.

1:42:56.300 --> 1:42:58.330
It's too late for any of that.

1:42:58.330 --> 1:42:59.330
Shut up!

1:43:00.460 --> 1:43:03.960
If you want to kill him,
you'll have to kill us first.

1:43:22.460 --> 1:43:23.730
Move, you bastard!

1:43:44.360 --> 1:43:46.400
Care to explain?

1:43:47.400 --> 1:43:50.560
Go to Seoul.
Don't ever come back.

1:43:51.330 --> 1:43:55.060
Are you asking me to
beg for my life?

1:43:55.060 --> 1:43:59.030
I'm saving your life,
even before you beg.

1:44:06.560 --> 1:44:09.100
You never got a warrant?

1:44:09.100 --> 1:44:10.700
Are you even listening?

1:45:23.400 --> 1:45:24.630
Don't go.

1:45:27.230 --> 1:45:28.630
You'll die if you do.

1:45:30.400 --> 1:45:33.630
Running away won't
change anything.

1:45:33.630 --> 1:45:35.860
Only death will end things.

1:45:35.860 --> 1:45:37.430
I don't care about that.

1:45:38.760 --> 1:45:40.930
I just want to
save my friend.

1:45:43.260 --> 1:45:45.330
You're such an idiot.

1:45:47.360 --> 1:45:49.400
Your friend is no different.

1:45:51.230 --> 1:45:53.560
He's approaching me, too.

1:47:26.700 --> 1:47:27.930
Fuck you!

1:47:29.100 --> 1:47:30.130
Take that!

1:49:46.100 --> 1:49:47.260
Are you upset?

1:49:48.600 --> 1:49:50.360
You don't deserve
to be upset.

1:49:51.200 --> 1:49:52.660
Of course not.

1:49:54.730 --> 1:49:58.030
I knew that
I'd die this way.

1:50:06.930 --> 1:50:10.660
That triumphant face of yours.

1:50:15.160 --> 1:50:16.600
It makes me laugh.

1:50:19.730 --> 1:50:21.400
Kim Gil-suk...

1:50:23.900 --> 1:50:27.000
You think that you're
nothing like me.

1:50:31.600 --> 1:50:34.800
But remember
how I look right now.

1:50:37.630 --> 1:50:43.830
Sooner or later,
you'll die just like this.

1:51:46.830 --> 1:51:48.560
Are you going to arrest me?

1:51:52.860 --> 1:51:58.400
My bosses, my brothers
and my friends...

1:51:59.400 --> 1:52:02.660
You did nothing
while they all died.

1:52:02.660 --> 1:52:04.660
But you're going
to arrest me?

1:52:13.560 --> 1:52:14.730
Gil-suk.

1:52:18.760 --> 1:52:20.530
Is this what you wanted?

1:52:25.100 --> 1:52:27.660
Will you be able to
live this way?

1:52:38.060 --> 1:52:39.960
What other choice did I have?

1:52:42.660 --> 1:52:43.930
I told you.

1:52:45.030 --> 1:52:49.300
Romance is long dead.
