WEBVTT

00:05.306 --> 00:07.478
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,

00:07.478 --> 00:10.181
I WAS INVESTIGATING
WHAT CAUSED ALL THIS.

00:10.181 --> 00:13.114
I SEEMED TO HAVE AN IDEA
WHY ALL OF THIS WAS HAPPENING.
WE KNOW YOU WERE
PLANNING AN ATTACK.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.286
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED!
WE DIDN'T DO THIS.

00:15.286 --> 00:17.388
YOU WERE STILL PLANNING ON
KILLING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

00:17.388 --> 00:20.491
I THINK GOD DID THIS
TO PUNISH US.

00:20.491 --> 00:22.523
I'M A LITTLE AT SEA IN DEALING
WITH DYLAN'S CONDITION.

00:22.523 --> 00:25.126
HE'S AUTISTIC.
THIS MAN MEANS NOTHING TO ME.

00:25.126 --> 00:27.598
I'M NOT GONNA CHEAT ON YOU.

00:27.598 --> 00:30.731
ON MARCH 15th, 2010,
YOU ARE GOING TO BE MURDERED.

00:33.304 --> 00:35.766
â™ªâ™ª

00:35.766 --> 00:38.769
(Bjork's "It's Oh So Quiet"
playing)

00:40.741 --> 00:42.573
â™ª SHH â™ª

00:47.678 --> 00:50.050
â™ª SHH â™ª

00:50.050 --> 00:54.155
â™ª IT'S OH SO QUIET â™ª

00:54.155 --> 00:55.626
â™ª SHH â™ª

00:55.626 --> 00:57.328
â™ª SHH â™ª

00:57.328 --> 01:00.631
â™ª IT'S OH SO STILL â™ª

01:00.631 --> 01:02.263
â™ª SHH â™ª

01:02.263 --> 01:03.634
â™ª SHH â™ª

01:03.634 --> 01:07.268
â™ª YOU'RE ALL ALONE â™ª

01:07.268 --> 01:09.770
â™ª SHH, SHH â™ª

01:09.770 --> 01:13.344
â™ª AND SO PEACEFUL UNTIL â™ª

01:14.845 --> 01:18.779
â™ª YOU FALL IN LOVE,
ZING, BOOM â™ª

01:18.779 --> 01:22.453
â™ª THE SKY UP ABOVE,
ZING, BOOM â™ª

01:22.453 --> 01:24.685
â™ª IS CAVING IN â™ª

01:24.685 --> 01:26.187
â™ª WOW! BAM! â™ª

01:26.187 --> 01:28.759
â™ª YOU'VE NEVER BEEN SO NUTS
ABOUT A GUY â™ª

01:28.759 --> 01:30.761
â™ª YOU WANNA LAUGH,
YOU WANNA CRY â™ª

01:30.761 --> 01:34.465
â™ª YOU CROSS YOUR HEART
AND HOPE TO DIE â™ª

01:34.465 --> 01:36.227
â™ª TILL IT'S OVER â™ª

01:36.227 --> 01:38.869
â™ª AND THEN â™ª

01:41.472 --> 01:45.776
â™ª IT'S NICE AND QUIET â™ª

01:45.776 --> 01:48.139
â™ª SHH, SHH â™ª

01:48.139 --> 01:51.442
â™ª BUT SOON AGAIN â™ª

01:53.714 --> 01:57.548
â™ª STARTS ANOTHER BIG RIOT â™ª

01:57.548 --> 01:58.719
â™ªâ™ª

01:58.719 --> 02:00.591
(gasps)

02:00.591 --> 02:04.124
(shouting in foreign language)

02:05.626 --> 02:09.200
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
YOU'RE GONNA BE JUST FINE, OKAY?

02:09.200 --> 02:12.203
(continues shouting)
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS
ON ONE, TWO, THREE,

02:12.203 --> 02:14.635
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE
A BIG BREATH WITH ME, OKAY?

02:14.635 --> 02:17.908
ONE, TWO, THREE.
(inhaling deeply)

02:35.326 --> 02:37.528
(man) YEAH.

02:37.528 --> 02:39.190
I REACHED THE SURFACE,

02:39.190 --> 02:42.193
DID THE AUSTRALIAN CRAWL
TO THE SHORE,

02:42.193 --> 02:44.495
AND THEN I WALKED HOME.
OH, AND THEN I, YOU KNOW,

02:44.495 --> 02:47.498
REALIZED THAT THE WHOLE WORLD
HAD BLACKED OUT.
THAT WAS TWO WEEKS AGO.

02:47.498 --> 02:49.800
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
YOU'VE SEEN A DOCTOR?

02:49.800 --> 02:51.802
YEAH, DIDN'T NEED ONE
TILL NOW.

02:51.802 --> 02:54.275
OKAY. WELL, MR. NED, I--

02:54.275 --> 02:56.207
YOU CAN CALL ME "EDWARD."

02:56.207 --> 02:57.548
EDWARD.

02:57.548 --> 03:00.411
WAIT, YOU KNOW, CALL ME "NED."
MY FRIENDS CALL ME NED.

03:00.411 --> 03:02.383
NED NED?

03:02.383 --> 03:04.215
YES YES.

03:04.215 --> 03:06.457
UH, HOW DID YOU STAY
SO CALM?

03:06.457 --> 03:08.889
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST WAS.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.862
HMM.
IT SAYS HERE THAT TRIAGE GAVE
YOUR MORPHINE FOR YOUR PAIN.

03:11.862 --> 03:14.865
DOES THAT MEAN--
LET ME TELL YA. THEY SHOULD
CALL THAT STUFF "MOR-FINE"

03:14.865 --> 03:17.668
'CAUSE THAT'S HOW I'M FEELING

03:17.668 --> 03:20.771
FOR THE FIRST TIME
SINCE THE CRASH.
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
COME IN SOONER?

03:20.771 --> 03:23.434
IT DIDN'T START OFF SO BAD.
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT I'D MAYBE

03:23.434 --> 03:25.436
JUST BRUISED MY SPLEEN
OR SOMETHIN'.

03:25.436 --> 03:28.609
OKAY, MR. NED--
UM, NED. WHATEVER.

03:28.609 --> 03:31.512
UH, I THINK WITH YOUR LOW BLOOD
COUNT AND YOUR PAIN, WE SHOULD

03:31.512 --> 03:35.786
KEEP YOU IN FOR OBSERVATION
AND A C.T. SCAN. ALL RIGHT?
IT'S ALL GRAVY, DR. BENFORD.
TRULY.

03:35.786 --> 03:36.987
OKAY, GOOD.

03:36.987 --> 03:38.849
NOW AFTER THE BLACKOUT,
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT--

03:38.849 --> 03:41.722
HEY, YOUR FLASH-FORWARD--
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

03:41.722 --> 03:44.895
NOT WHERE I WAS GOIN'.
YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW?

03:46.397 --> 03:49.730
I WAS ROCKING LEATHER PANTS.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.932
I'VE NEVER ROCKED
LEATHER PANTS.

03:51.932 --> 03:52.963
(whoosh)

03:52.963 --> 03:55.336
(George Clinton) â™ª ATOMIC DOG â™ª

03:55.336 --> 03:58.008
(Ned) IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
ONE OF MY TOP THREE FEARS,

03:58.008 --> 04:00.441
ALONG WITH CLOWNS
AND ESCALATORS.

04:00.441 --> 04:03.844
BUT THERE I WAS,
ROCKING OUT AT THIS BAR

04:03.844 --> 04:07.418
THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO GO TO BUT I'VE NEVER GONE TO

04:07.418 --> 04:10.421
BECAUSE I-I THOUGHT I'D BE
TOO NERVOUS THAT I'D BE...

04:10.421 --> 04:12.623
WELL, TOO NERVOUS. (chuckles)

04:12.623 --> 04:14.625
BUT IT WASN'T THAT WAY.

04:14.625 --> 04:16.427
I WAS HAPPY.

04:16.427 --> 04:19.990
I WAS AT PEACE.
â™ª WHY MUST I FEEL LIKE THAT? â™ª

04:19.990 --> 04:22.363
OH, AND I WAS BLACK.

04:22.363 --> 04:23.994
WAIT, YOU WERE...

04:23.994 --> 04:25.536
BLACK?

04:25.536 --> 04:27.568
YEAH.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.340
LIKE OPRAH.

04:29.340 --> 04:31.001
YOU KNOW, AFRICAN-AMERICAN.
BLACK.

04:31.001 --> 04:33.374
OKAY.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.905
OKAY, MR. NED.

04:34.905 --> 04:37.047
(Olivia) WELL, OKAY.

04:37.047 --> 04:39.279
WE'LL SEE YOU LATER, MR. NED.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.281
OKAY. YEAH.

04:50.661 --> 04:53.664
SO THEY'RE YOUR PARENTS,
SO I THINK YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE

04:53.664 --> 04:55.866
TO TELL THEM THAT
WE MOVED UP THE WEDDING.
UH-HUH.

04:55.866 --> 04:57.868
THOUGH I'M SURE
A FREE TO TRIP TO HAWAII

04:57.868 --> 05:00.931
STILL WON'T MAKE UP FOR THE FACT
THAT I'M NOT KOREAN.
RIGHT.

05:00.931 --> 05:02.903
OKAY, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
FOR THE LAST 20 MINUTES?

05:02.903 --> 05:06.677
I'M FINE. IT'S JUST WORK STUFF.
WORK STUFF.

05:06.677 --> 05:10.681
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TRACE A CALL
FROM, UH, AN INFORMANT.

05:10.681 --> 05:13.914
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
YEAH, I'M HERE. OKAY.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.887
WELL, SPEAKING OF WORK, CAN I
ASK YOU SOMETHING WORK-RELATED?

05:16.887 --> 05:20.020
REALLY YOU GUYS GITMO-ING
A SUSPECT DOWNTOWN?

05:20.020 --> 05:21.722
NO.

05:21.722 --> 05:24.895
SOME BLONDE, ARRESTED
THE DAY OF THE BLACKOUT.

05:24.895 --> 05:27.858
bin LADEN IN PRADA?
(camera shutter clicks)

05:27.858 --> 05:30.030
(chuckles) I CAN'T CONFIRM
OR DENY THIS, ZO.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.032
I THINK YOU JUST DID, SWEETIE.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.804
(laughs) WOW.
(laughs)

05:33.804 --> 05:35.035
LOOK, PROFESSIONALLY,

05:35.035 --> 05:37.337
IF THE BUREAU'S VIOLATING
SOMEONE'S DUE PROCESS,

05:37.337 --> 05:38.439
THAT'S UNCOOL.

05:38.439 --> 05:39.940
BUT PERSONALLY,

05:39.940 --> 05:43.414
IF THAT WOMAN HAS ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THE BLACKOUT,

05:43.414 --> 05:45.876
I REALLY HOPE YOU GET
ALL DICK CHENEY ON HER ASS

05:45.876 --> 05:47.878
TO FIND OUT WHAT SHE KNOWS.

05:47.878 --> 05:49.550
(Mark) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...

05:49.550 --> 05:51.882
(clears throat)
(giggles)

05:51.882 --> 05:53.984
(imitates British accent)
AS EGGBERT,

05:53.984 --> 05:57.758
I WOULD LIKE TO EGG-XPRESS
MY DESIRE

05:57.758 --> 06:01.392
FOR YOU TO EAT OATMEAL
THIS MORNING.

06:01.392 --> 06:03.394
(laughs) YOU'RE SILLY, DADDY.

06:03.394 --> 06:07.037
(normal voice) SILLY?
CAN I GET A "CLUCK CLUCK"?
CLUCK CLUCK!

06:07.037 --> 06:08.999
(giggles)

06:08.999 --> 06:10.401
CLUCK CLUCK.

06:10.401 --> 06:12.072
(imitates British accent)
THANK YOU MUCHLY.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.875
I BELIEVE YOU KNOW MY MUM.
(clears throat)

06:14.875 --> 06:15.906
(egg cracks)
OH!

06:15.906 --> 06:18.449
(Olivia) OH.
AW, EGGBERT!

06:18.449 --> 06:19.910
WOW, YOU REALLY ARE

06:19.910 --> 06:21.912
THE SHAKESPEARE
OF CHEESY DAD HUMOR.

06:21.912 --> 06:25.856
(normal voice) AH, YOU COULD
PLAY, TOO. YOU COULD BE...

06:25.856 --> 06:27.858
(imitates French accent)
ZE FRENCH TOAST.

06:27.858 --> 06:29.920
ZE TOAST OF LOVE.
(laughs)

06:29.920 --> 06:31.962
GOOD MORNING.
GOOD MORNING.

06:31.962 --> 06:33.123
HEY, MOMMY.

06:33.123 --> 06:34.725
HI, SWEETIE.

06:34.725 --> 06:37.698
SO GUESS WHO'S PICKING YOU UP
FROM SCHOOL THIS MORNING?

06:37.698 --> 06:39.900
NICOLE?
THAT'S RIGHT. NICOLE.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.973
SHE MISSED YOU. SHE'S READY
TO START BABYSITTING AGAIN.

06:42.973 --> 06:44.975
YAY!
YEAH, NICOLE IS COMING BACK.

06:44.975 --> 06:47.177
YEAH, NICOLE IS COMING BACK.

06:49.139 --> 06:51.141
THANKS FOR BREAKFAST.

06:51.141 --> 06:53.143
FIRST TIME IN A WHILE

06:53.143 --> 06:57.848
I'VE BEEN OUT
ACTING LIKE A NORMAL PERSON.

06:57.848 --> 06:59.850
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

07:02.923 --> 07:06.527
YOU WANT AN ICE CREAM
OR SOMETHING?

07:06.527 --> 07:07.998
WHERE WAS THAT PLACE

07:07.998 --> 07:10.000
TRACY USED TO TAKE YOU
WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.002
THEY TURNED IT
INTO A GIANT JUICE

07:12.002 --> 07:14.735
WHEN I WAS A FRESHMAN.
HMM.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.668
SHE SPENT ALL THE MONEY
SHE MADE BABYSITTING YOU

07:17.668 --> 07:21.872
BUYING YOU MILKSHAKES.

07:21.872 --> 07:23.744
I SHOULD GET GOING.

07:23.744 --> 07:25.746
IT'S MY FIRST DAY BACK
AT THE BENFORDS',

07:25.746 --> 07:28.949
SO I DON'T WANT TO BE LATE.

07:28.949 --> 07:32.182
MARK TOLD ME
YOU WENT A.W.O.L.

07:32.182 --> 07:34.655
I'M SORRY, AARON.

07:34.655 --> 07:37.658
YOU GOT ME THAT JOB WITH THEM,
AND I TOTALLY SCREWED IT UP.

07:37.658 --> 07:40.891
IF THAT WERE TRUE, THEY WOULDN'T
HAVE ASKED YOU TO COME BACK.

07:40.891 --> 07:42.893
YOU KNOW, NICOLE,
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

07:42.893 --> 07:44.895
EVERYONE'S FREAKED OUT
BY THIS.

07:44.895 --> 07:48.539
BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO SURRENDER
TO A HIGHER POWER AND HAVE FAITH

07:48.539 --> 07:51.041
THAT WHATEVER WE SAW,
WE SAW FOR A REASON,

07:56.046 --> 07:58.949
(coins dropping)
SO MAKE COWBELL LADY N.P.O.

07:58.949 --> 08:01.051
WE'LL TAKE HER TO THE O.R.
IF SHE SPIKES AGAIN.
(beep)

08:01.051 --> 08:02.182
YEAH.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.214
AND, UH, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE SCAN ON...

08:04.214 --> 08:06.056
OH, COME ON.

08:06.056 --> 08:07.718
COME ON!

08:07.718 --> 08:09.660
UGH!

08:09.660 --> 08:11.922
WHAT DID THE SCAN SHOW
ON OUR BUS CRASH GUY?

08:11.922 --> 08:13.223
YEAH. NED?
MM-HMM.

08:13.223 --> 08:16.126
OH, I-I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT THAT GUY.

08:16.126 --> 08:18.128
I MEAN, HOW DOES SOMEBODY
POSSIBLY GO

08:18.128 --> 08:21.101
FROM BEING CAUCASIAN
TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN?

08:21.101 --> 08:23.804
I MEAN, IF--IF THAT'S THE VISION
THAT HE SAW IN HIS FUTURE,

08:23.804 --> 08:26.807
THEN I GUESS--
UGH. BRYCE, I NEED YOU
IN THE PRESENT--HERE, NOW.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.939
YEAH.
YOU KNOW, PATIENT CARE,
DOCTORING, C.T. SCAN.

08:28.939 --> 08:30.941
STILL DON'T HAVE IT.
E.R.'s GOT A BUNCH OF TRAUMAS.

08:30.941 --> 08:34.084
THEY KEEP BUMPING NED
FROM THE SCANNER.

08:34.084 --> 08:36.086
SO I RAN INTO DR. FLEMMING
EARLIER.
WHO?

08:36.086 --> 08:38.088
BLYTHE FLEMMING--
THE PSYCHIATRIST

08:38.088 --> 08:40.090
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
FOLLOWING UP WITH EVERY WEEK?

08:40.090 --> 08:42.823
YEAH, WELL, IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
I'VE HAD MY ROUNDS AND, UM...

08:42.823 --> 08:44.795
COME ON.
LESS THAN A MONTH AGO,

08:44.795 --> 08:47.297
YOU WERE STANDING ON A PIER
WITH A GUN.

08:51.562 --> 08:53.133
I KNOW HOW IT SOUNDS,

08:53.133 --> 08:55.906
BUT TRUST ME,
THINGS HAVE CHANGED.
IF YOU WANNA
KEEP WORKING HERE,

08:55.906 --> 08:57.968
YOU NEED TO FOLLOW UP WITH PSYCH
AT TWICE A WEEK. YOU GOT IT?
YEAH.

08:57.968 --> 09:00.941
(tray clanks)
(Dylan screaming)

09:00.941 --> 09:03.574
EXCUSE ME. OHH! BOLLOCKS.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.879
(whoosh)
HEY, HONEY.

09:08.879 --> 09:11.321
SORRY.

09:11.321 --> 09:15.926
(Dylan whining and grunting)

09:20.190 --> 09:22.763
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT SIMCOE KID IS OFF O-2 NOW.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.935
I WANNA TRANSFER HIM
TO PHYSICAL THERAPY.

09:24.935 --> 09:27.037
YEAH, BUT HE'S
ON I.V. ANTIBIOTICS.

09:27.037 --> 09:29.169
(sighs) JUST AS SOON
AS YOU CAN, OKAY?

09:29.169 --> 09:31.872
YEAH.
AND I NEED
THAT SCAN OF NED'S,

09:31.872 --> 09:35.045
SO WHEEL HIM TO THE SCANNER
YOURSELF IF YOU HAVE TO.
OKAY.

09:35.045 --> 09:37.347
(Wedeck) YOU WANNA GO
TO SOMALIA NOW?

09:37.347 --> 09:39.980
LAST WEEK, YOU TALKED ME INTO
FLYING YOU TO GERMANY

09:39.980 --> 09:42.282
BECAUSE OF AN INDEX CARD.
AND IT PAID OFF.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.284
MM-HMM. YOU FOUND OUT SOME CROWS
DIED IN SOMALIA 18 YEARS AGO.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.757
YOU KNOW, YOUR DEFINITION
OF "PAID OFF"

09:46.757 --> 09:48.759
IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT
THAN MINE.

09:48.759 --> 09:51.291
IF A BLACKOUT HAD HAPPENED
BEFORE, THAT'D BE MAJOR.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.664
I AGREE, WHICH KIND OF
MAKES YOU WONDER

09:53.664 --> 09:56.767
WHY WE HAVEN'T HEARD
ABOUT IT BEFORE.
EVIDENCE, STAN.
THERE IS EVIDENCE.

09:56.767 --> 09:58.769
LAST I CHECKED,

09:58.769 --> 10:00.901
ALL YOU'VE GOT IS A FOOTNOTE
IN A C.D.C. FUNDING REQUEST.

10:00.901 --> 10:04.104
I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH MARK
ON TRYING TO GET

10:04.104 --> 10:06.837
SATELLITE PHOTOS OF THE REGION
FROM '91 OUT OF LANGLEY.
MM-HMM.

10:06.837 --> 10:09.980
BUT THEY'VE BEEN GIVING US
THE RUNAROUND, SO--
MAYBE THE CIA's
JUST A LITTLE BUSY THESE DAYS

10:09.980 --> 10:13.143
TO DIG THROUGH SATELLITE INTEL
FROM LAST DECADE.

10:13.143 --> 10:15.215
GUYS, I GET IT.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.217
GERMANY DIDN'T EXACTLY WORK OUT,

10:17.217 --> 10:20.290
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO STRETCH
A SINGLE INTO A TRIPLE.

10:20.290 --> 10:22.292
I GET IT.

10:22.292 --> 10:26.056
BUT GOING TO WAR WITH THE CIA
IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.030
HEY, AL,

10:30.030 --> 10:32.032
REMEMBER THAT HACKER
WE BUSTED?

10:32.032 --> 10:34.334
YOU KNOW, THE ONE WHO BROKE
INTO THE D.O.D.'s NETWORK,

10:34.334 --> 10:38.038
TRYING TO TAKE OUR OVERSEAS
DRONES FOR A JOYRIDE?

10:38.038 --> 10:39.339
MR. CHEETO DUST?

10:39.339 --> 10:41.712
YEAH, THAT'S HIM.
DON'T YOU THINK

10:41.712 --> 10:44.644
HE'D FIND LANGLEY'S MAINFRAME
A DELIGHTFUL CHALLENGE?

10:44.644 --> 10:47.948
YEAH, HE'D FIND IT DELIGHTFUL.
IT'S ILLEGAL.

10:47.948 --> 10:51.051
WHOA.
SPYING ON YOUR OWN COUNTRY?

10:51.051 --> 10:53.053
THAT'S MORE THAN
SOME PROCEDURAL JUJITSU.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.055
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
A FEDERAL OFFENSE.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.858
YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT.
WHERE'S DEMETRI?

10:57.858 --> 11:00.230
UH, HE BROUGHT THAT HOT BLONDE
TERRORIST OVER FROM HOLDING.

11:00.230 --> 11:02.232
HE'S QUESTIONING HER NOW.
WHY?

11:02.232 --> 11:05.295
I DON'T KNOW.
'CAUSE SHE'S HOT?
(elevator bell dings)

11:05.295 --> 11:08.939
(scoffs) I'LL REPEAT
WHAT I'VE SAID MANY TIMES.

11:08.939 --> 11:12.102
MY NAME IS ALDA HERTZOG, AND I'M
AN HONEST BUSINESSPERSON.

11:12.102 --> 11:14.244
YEAH, WE CAUGHT YOU
DOING BUSINESS

11:14.244 --> 11:17.748
ON THE DAY OF THE BLACKOUT.
REMEMBER? WITH KNOWN TERRORISTS,

11:17.748 --> 11:21.111
SELLING THEM WEAPONIZED
NUCLEAR MATERIAL.
THEN CHARGE ME WITH A CRIME.

11:21.111 --> 11:23.113
YOU CAN'T HOLD ME HERE
INDEFINITELY.

11:23.113 --> 11:26.216
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU SHOULD CALL
YOUR EMBASSY AND COMPLAIN.

11:26.216 --> 11:28.989
WHICH EMBASSY IS THAT,
BY THE WAY?

11:28.989 --> 11:30.991
WE WANNA KNOW 'CAUSE, UH,

11:30.991 --> 11:33.924
WE WANNA GET YOU
THE RIGHT PHONE CARD.

11:36.066 --> 11:38.769
I'M TRULY FLATTERED
THAT YOU STILL FEEL THE NEED

11:38.769 --> 11:41.071
TO TALK TO ME
AFTER ALL THAT'S HAPPENED.

11:41.071 --> 11:43.934
BUT I'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG.

11:43.934 --> 11:46.406
IT'S MY ASSOCIATES WHO YOU WANT.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.279
HONEY, YOUR ASSOCIATES DIED
ON THE DAY OF THE BLACKOUT.

11:49.279 --> 11:50.981
THEY WERE SUPER DEAD.

11:53.343 --> 11:56.046
SO YOU WANNA GIVE ME
SOMEBODY ELSE?

11:58.088 --> 12:01.151
CUSTOMER CHOICE
RESTAURANT GROUP.

12:05.395 --> 12:07.958
IT'S IN INDIO.

12:07.958 --> 12:10.300
TOWN COMES UP
A BUNCH OF TIMES IN WIRETAPS,

12:10.300 --> 12:12.502
BUT WE NEVER FOUND OUT
THE SIGNIFICANCE.

12:12.502 --> 12:15.005
CUSTOMER CHOICE
RESTAURANT GROUP.

12:15.005 --> 12:17.307
THAT'S ALL I HAVE
FOR YOU TODAY.

12:26.376 --> 12:28.218
YOU'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME

12:28.218 --> 12:30.921
FOR THIS TO CONTINUE BEING
A CIVIL CONVERSATION.

12:30.921 --> 12:33.153
REALLY, AGENT NOH?

12:33.153 --> 12:37.057
HERE I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE ONE
RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.159
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

12:39.159 --> 12:42.863
YOU REALLY SHOULD GET OUT THERE
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

12:53.543 --> 12:55.505
I'M NOT--I'M NOT GETTING THIS.

12:55.505 --> 12:58.108
INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING UP
ON THE SOMALIA LEAD,

12:58.108 --> 13:00.510
YOU WANNA REOPEN
THE DIRTY BOMB CASE?
WE NEVER CLOSED IT.

13:00.510 --> 13:03.183
AND SOMALIA IS NOT A LEAD.
IT'S AN URBAN MYTH AT BEST.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.215
MEANWHILE,
BACK ON PLANET EARTH,

13:05.215 --> 13:07.958
WE HAVE A MATERIAL WITNESS--
IN A WEAPONS DEAL.

13:07.958 --> 13:10.991
THAT BROKE ON THE DAY
OF THE BLACKOUT.

13:10.991 --> 13:14.064
OKAY, SO MAYBE IT'S NOT AS SEXY
AS DEAD POULTRY IN AFRICA,

13:14.064 --> 13:17.067
BUT YOU GOTTA ADMIT THE TIMING'S
A LITTLE HINKY HERE, MARK.

13:17.067 --> 13:19.069
IT'S A COINCIDENCE!
SO WHAT IF IT IS?

13:19.069 --> 13:23.103
IT IS A LEGIT LEAD
ON A TERRORISM INVESTIGATION,

13:23.103 --> 13:25.906
WHICH IS KIND OF
WHAT WE DO AROUND HERE.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.807
AGREED.

13:27.807 --> 13:31.912
SEND ME A POSTCARD
FROM INDIO.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.813
YEAH.

13:33.813 --> 13:38.088
WHAT THE HELL'S
THE MATTER WITH YOU?

13:38.088 --> 13:41.091
I JUST WANT TO BE
AN FBI AGENT TODAY. ALL RIGHT?

13:41.091 --> 13:42.953
LIFE IS SHORT.

13:42.953 --> 13:45.956
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

13:49.029 --> 13:51.031
(cash register bell dings)

13:56.066 --> 13:59.609
THANK YOU
FOR PUTTING UP WITH ME.

13:59.609 --> 14:01.341
HI, MR. SIMCOE.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.174
I'M AFRAID
I'M THE ANNOYING PARENT

14:04.174 --> 14:06.176
WHO ALWAYS WANTS
A THOUSAND DETAILS.

14:06.176 --> 14:09.519
I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE
FOR THAT.

14:11.581 --> 14:14.124
I CAN TELL
IT MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE.

14:14.124 --> 14:17.287
NO, IT DOESN'T. DOESN'T MAKE ME
UNCOMFORTABLE AT ALL.

14:17.287 --> 14:19.429
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE LITTLE
OUTBURST THIS MORNING...

14:19.429 --> 14:21.431
THE TANTRUM IN THE HALLWAY,

14:21.431 --> 14:24.935
THE... UNIDENTIFIED
FLYING MEAL TRAY.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.999
IT'S HIS AUTISM.
MM-HMM.

14:28.999 --> 14:32.002
I-I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO
SAY TO HIM WHEN HE'S LIKE THAT.

14:32.002 --> 14:34.004
OH, SOMETIMES
YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING.

14:34.004 --> 14:36.907
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE THERE.
THANKS.

14:36.907 --> 14:38.048
THANK YOU.

14:38.048 --> 14:39.379
YEAH, UNFORTUNATELY,

14:39.379 --> 14:42.082
I HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN THERE
SINCE OUR SEPARATION.

14:42.082 --> 14:46.516
UH... YOU KNOW,
WORK PICKED UP AND, UM...

14:46.516 --> 14:48.989
WELL, I BARELY KNOW HIM.

14:48.989 --> 14:53.093
WELL, YOU'RE HERE NOW.
IT'S WHAT COUNTS.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.095
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP
MIGHT HELP.

14:55.095 --> 14:58.168
YEAH, WELL, DESPITE THE LUXURY
OF TWO RIGID PLASTIC CHAIRS

14:58.168 --> 15:01.331
IN DYLAN'S ROOM, THE SANDMAN
HAS PROVEN A BIT ELUSIVE.

15:01.331 --> 15:04.334
WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T BE SLEEPING
IN HIS ROOM EVERY NIGHT.
WELL, ACTUALLY,

15:04.334 --> 15:07.437
THE POLICE BROUGHT ME THE KEYS
TO HIS MOTHER'S HOUSE.

15:07.437 --> 15:11.982
I JUST CAN'T BRING MYSELF
TO GO THERE FOR SOME REASON.
WELL, YOU SHOULD TRY.

15:11.982 --> 15:14.284
MAYBE BEING IN DYLAN'S ROOM,
AROUND HIS THINGS...

15:14.284 --> 15:17.147
IT MIGHT GIVE YOU SOME SENSE
OF WHO HE IS.

15:17.147 --> 15:20.991
TOO MUCH TIME IN THE HOSPITAL IS
NOT GOOD FOR ANYONE, MR. SIMCOE.

15:20.991 --> 15:22.993
YOU HANG IN THERE.

15:24.294 --> 15:27.297
HEY, DR. B., I-I GOT THAT SCAN
THAT YOU WANTED.

15:27.297 --> 15:29.299
I WAS JUST GONNA GRAB
A VEGGIE DOG

15:29.299 --> 15:32.462
WHILE IT PRINTS OUT.
TRANSFER DYLAN SIMCOE
TO PHYSICAL THERAPY.

15:32.462 --> 15:37.037
BUT I THOUGHT
YOU WANTED HIM TO--
P.T. CAN HANDLE THE ANTIBIOTICS.
JUST TRANSFER HIM.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.368
OKAY.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.375
â™ªâ™ª

15:45.375 --> 15:49.119
(man) I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT ALL THIS IS ABOUT.
WELCOME TO MY WORLD.

15:49.119 --> 15:52.152
THIS RESTAURANT CAME UP
IN A CONFIDENTIAL INVESTIGATION.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.454
WE NEED THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES
OF EVERY EMPLOYEE.

15:54.454 --> 15:57.157
THE LIST, PLEASE. THANK YOU.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.989
BURGERS AND WAFFLE FRIES--
THAT'S ALL WE DO.

15:58.989 --> 16:00.430
WELL, FOR NOW AT LEAST.

16:00.430 --> 16:03.533
WE'RE GOING TO BE ADDING
FROZEN YOGURT

16:03.533 --> 16:06.296
IN, YOU KNOW, THE FUTURE.
SO THIS PLACE IS OWNED

16:06.296 --> 16:08.298
BY CUSTOMER CHOICE
RESTAURANT GROUP?
UH, THIS PLACE IS

16:08.298 --> 16:10.540
CUSTOMER CHOICE
RESTAURANT GROUP.

16:10.540 --> 16:12.642
UH, WE'RE NOT QUITE
A GROUP YET.

16:12.642 --> 16:16.006
WOULD YOU GIVE ME AND AGENT NOH
A MOMENT, PLEASE?
SURE. YEAH.

16:16.006 --> 16:19.379
UH, SOMEBODY GET SOME BURGERS
FOR THESE FBI GUYS, PLEASE!

16:19.379 --> 16:22.382
WOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T
WANT TO COME HERE TODAY.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.514
I MEAN, THE INTEL--
THEY'RE ADDING FROZEN YOGURT!

16:24.514 --> 16:26.116
(loud clatter)

16:35.595 --> 16:37.697
FREEZE!

16:39.329 --> 16:40.770
FBI!

16:40.770 --> 16:43.173
AAH! AAH!

16:43.173 --> 16:45.405
(horn honks, tires screech)

16:48.708 --> 16:49.779
(grunts)

16:51.141 --> 16:53.483
AAH!
(grunts)

16:53.483 --> 16:57.687
(trumpet playing in distance)

16:57.687 --> 17:01.451
GO LEFT. GO LEFT.
GOTCHA. GO.

17:01.451 --> 17:05.155
â™ªâ™ª

17:16.136 --> 17:18.037
UHH!
(woman screams)

17:22.112 --> 17:26.116
â™ªâ™ª

17:29.519 --> 17:34.053
(barking and snarling)

17:34.053 --> 17:37.056
(children laughing and shouting
in distance)

17:37.056 --> 17:40.460
(man speaking indistinctly
on TV)

17:45.335 --> 17:47.267
AAH!

17:47.267 --> 17:49.339
UHH!

17:49.339 --> 17:51.541
(both grunt)

17:53.143 --> 17:56.146
(grunting)
COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON!

17:56.146 --> 17:57.447
(Demetri) YOU GOT HIM!

17:57.447 --> 18:01.181
(shouting)
SHUT UP, MAN!

18:01.181 --> 18:03.413
WHAT'S WITH THE JOG, MAN?
(Mark) GET UP.

18:03.413 --> 18:06.456
GET UP!
I THOUGHT WE WERE
JUST COMING IN FOR A BURGER.

18:06.456 --> 18:08.688
(unzips backpack)
ON YOUR KNEES!
GET ON YOUR KNEES!

18:08.688 --> 18:10.690
(Russian accent)
I HEARD WHAT YOU'RE BEING.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.692
FBI CAN BE BITING MY ASS!

18:12.692 --> 18:15.125
OH! HELLO!

18:15.125 --> 18:17.096
YELLOWCAKE URANIUM, MARK.

18:17.096 --> 18:20.099
BLACK MARKET NUCLEAR MATERIAL.
(pants)

18:20.099 --> 18:22.532
OR DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD LEAVE
IT HERE, GO BACK TO YOUR OFFICE

18:22.532 --> 18:25.475
AND STARE
AT YOUR BULLETIN BOARD?
YOU DON'T BE WANTING THIS, YO.

18:25.475 --> 18:27.277
HEY!

18:27.277 --> 18:30.240
YELLOWCAKE.

18:30.240 --> 18:33.883
(case thuds)
IT'S THE TYPE OF STRAIN,
THE TYPE OF WEED HE'S SLINGIN'!

18:33.883 --> 18:36.586
IT'S THE SICKEST STRAIN
'ROUND, YO.

18:36.586 --> 18:39.789
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,
I'M DRIVING PIMPING RIDE.

18:39.789 --> 18:41.751
19-INCH RIMS, YO.

18:41.751 --> 18:45.325
I MUST BE GOING TO BE
SCARFACE OF POT.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.457
YOU CAN'T
BE FIGHTING FATE, YO.

18:49.529 --> 18:53.633
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
AAH! AAH! TRUTH HURTS, PIG!

18:53.633 --> 18:56.636
GET OFF OF ME! GET OFF!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

18:56.636 --> 19:00.710
I WAS SICK OF HIS MOUTH!
I'M TALKING ABOUT TODAY!
I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU!

19:00.710 --> 19:02.772
RACIN' AROUND,
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO SHOOT!

19:02.772 --> 19:05.175
JUST DROP YOUR PERSONAL CRAP
AND DO YOUR JOB!

19:05.175 --> 19:07.877
HEY, I'M DOING SOMETHING!
I'M NOT SITTING ON MY ASS,

19:07.877 --> 19:11.581
WAITING FOR CLUES TO APPEAR
TO ME IN MY DREAMS!
OH, GIVE IT REST.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT WHAT I SAW.

19:11.581 --> 19:14.224
IT'S ABOUT WHAT YOU DID!
(grunts)

19:17.487 --> 19:19.489
(panting)

19:19.489 --> 19:20.930
MARCH 15th.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.466
THREE SHOTS TO THE CHEST.

19:28.198 --> 19:31.871
I'M NOT JUST GONNA DIE.
I'M GONNA BE MURDERED.

19:40.910 --> 19:44.914
(women speaking indistinctly
on police radio)

19:52.191 --> 19:54.193
HOW'D YOU FIND OUT?

19:56.195 --> 19:58.768
ANONYMOUS CALL.

19:58.768 --> 20:03.633
THE WOMAN SAID SHE READ IT
IN AN INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING.

20:03.633 --> 20:05.635
THAT'S ALL SHE GAVE ME.

20:05.635 --> 20:07.777
(dog barking in distance)

20:07.777 --> 20:09.779
MARK, I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T TELL YOU,

20:09.779 --> 20:13.783
BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD
FIND WHO'S GONNA KILL ME

20:13.783 --> 20:16.686
OR GET A LEAD ON THEM.
I DON'T KNOW, BUT...

20:16.686 --> 20:20.350
WHY WOULD YOU THINK
THERE'S ANYTHING OUT HERE?

20:20.350 --> 20:23.393
ALDA SAID
I WAS RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

20:23.393 --> 20:25.595
THAT WAS IT?

20:25.595 --> 20:26.756
YEAH.

20:26.756 --> 20:29.959
DEM, ALDA'S A PRO.

20:29.959 --> 20:33.703
SHE KNOWS YOU'RE VULNERABLE,
AND SHE PULLED A NUMBER ON YOU.

20:37.537 --> 20:40.970
(whispers) ALL I CAN HEAR
IS THE CLOCK TICKING.

20:40.970 --> 20:42.842
EVERY DAY.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.345
(normal voice)
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

20:45.345 --> 20:48.548
SOMEHOW...
YOU GET PAST THE FEAR

20:48.548 --> 20:50.019
AND YOU FIGHT.

20:50.019 --> 20:52.882
HOW?
YOU KNOW WHAT I SAW.

20:52.882 --> 20:54.854
(whoosh)

20:54.854 --> 20:58.388
(Mark) I'M IN MY OFFICE,
STARING AT THE MOSAIC BOARD,

20:58.388 --> 20:59.729
AND MEN ARE COMING IN
TO KILL ME.
(whoosh)

20:59.729 --> 21:01.791
YOU AND I ARE PARTNERS.

21:01.791 --> 21:04.263
IF THEY'RE COMING TO KILL ME,
THEY'RE PROBABLY AFTER YOU, TOO,

21:04.263 --> 21:06.496
OR GONNA BE.
IT'S THE FUTURE, MARK.

21:06.496 --> 21:09.439
W-WHY DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN STOP IT?
BECAUSE WE SAW IT.

21:09.439 --> 21:13.002
WE CAN USE WHAT WE SAW
TO STOP WHAT WE SAW.

21:13.002 --> 21:16.976
DEMETRI, WE CAN SOLVE
YOUR MURDER BEFORE IT HAPPENS.

21:16.976 --> 21:20.880
THAT'S WHY I WANNA PUT
EVERYTHING WE HAVE ON MOSAIC.

21:20.880 --> 21:24.283
FOR YOU. FOR ME.
FOR EVERYBODY.

21:32.662 --> 21:33.923
(bird calling)

21:33.923 --> 21:36.626
NOW CAN WE GET OUT OF HERE?

21:38.668 --> 21:41.000
YEAH. WE CAN.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.703
OH, EXCUSE ME.

21:43.703 --> 21:44.934
HEY, MR. SIMCOE.

21:44.934 --> 21:47.377
STEPPING OUT FOR A BIT?

21:47.377 --> 21:50.309
JUST, UH,
FOLLOWING SOME ADVICE.
OH.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.812
I THINK YOU LEFT THIS
IN DYLAN'S ROOM.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.985
OH, UH... THANKS.

21:55.985 --> 21:57.647
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.
YEAH.

21:57.647 --> 21:59.318
YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

21:59.318 --> 22:01.851
UM, WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY MET.

22:01.851 --> 22:03.593
COMING UP SOON,

22:03.593 --> 22:06.856
A GLENDALE POSTAL WORKER
USES THE MOSAIC WEB SITE

22:06.856 --> 22:08.858
TO MEET THE POLICE OFFICER
HE BELIEVES

22:08.858 --> 22:10.860
IS GOING TO SAVE HIS LIFE
IN THE COMING MONTHS.

22:10.860 --> 22:13.833
YOU WON'T WANNA MISS THIS.
BUT FIRST...

22:13.833 --> 22:16.536
AH, IT'S INCREDIBLE,
ISN'T IT?

22:16.536 --> 22:18.908
A TEMPORAL ANOMALY
IN GLOBAL CONSCIOUSNESS.

22:18.908 --> 22:21.411
YEAH, I THINK THAT QUALIFIES.

22:21.411 --> 22:23.373
SO WHAT'D YOU SEE?

22:24.944 --> 22:27.947
OH, I GUESS THIS IS THE NEW
"HOW'S THE WEATHER," ISN'T IT?

22:33.022 --> 22:35.054
WELL, THEN...

22:35.054 --> 22:36.886
WHY NOT? UM...

22:36.886 --> 22:38.728
(whoosh)
(Lloyd) I WAS IN A HOUSE--

22:38.728 --> 22:41.561
UH, NOT MY OWN HOUSE.
I GOT A CALL FROM SOMEONE.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.963
I DON'T KNOW WHO IT WAS,
BUT IT WAS URGENT.

22:43.963 --> 22:47.967
DYLAN WAS NEARBY,
MAYBE IN ANOTHER ROOM.

22:47.967 --> 22:51.000
I HEARD A WOMAN'S VOICE...
(Olivia) HEY, HONEY.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.972
I TURNED TOWARDS IT...

22:52.972 --> 22:55.044
AND IT WAS OVER.

22:55.044 --> 22:57.707
UM, I NEVER SAW HER FACE.

22:57.707 --> 23:00.810
BUT I KNEW
THAT WE WERE TOGETHER...

23:02.051 --> 23:04.754
THAT SHE WAS
IMPORTANT TO ME SOMEHOW.

23:04.754 --> 23:07.417
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN.

23:07.417 --> 23:09.919
HERE'S THE SCAN, DOCTOR.
THANK YOU.

23:09.919 --> 23:12.962
UM, EXCUSE ME ONE--
ONE SECOND. I'M SORRY.

23:12.962 --> 23:14.864
DR. BENFORD!

23:14.864 --> 23:17.066
DR. B. DR. B.!

23:17.066 --> 23:18.768
NED'S C.T.

23:18.768 --> 23:20.430
OH, GREAT.

23:21.971 --> 23:24.003
WHOA. BIG HEMATOMA.

23:24.003 --> 23:26.576
BLOOD'S BEEN GATHERING AROUND
THE LIVER SINCE THE BUS CRASH.

23:26.576 --> 23:28.778
NED'S LUCKY HE SHOWED UP HERE
IN TIME.

23:28.778 --> 23:30.910
WELL, N-NO, IT'S NOT LUCK.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.042
IT'S... I MEAN,
HE WAS ALIVE IN HIS VISION.

23:33.042 --> 23:35.044
SO CLEARLY HE MADE IT
TO THE HOSPITAL--

23:35.044 --> 23:37.046
OH, GOD. ENOUGH ABOUT
THE VISIONS, DR. VARLEY.

23:37.046 --> 23:40.049
NO, DR. BENFORD,
IT'S RELEVANT DATA.
IT'S NOT DATA.

23:40.049 --> 23:43.553
IT'S NOT DATA ANY MORE THAN
THE DREAM I HAD LAST NIGHT.

23:43.553 --> 23:46.756
LOOK, I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU CAN IGNORE SOMETHING

23:46.756 --> 23:49.459
THAT EVEN THE MOST SKEPTICAL
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD

23:49.459 --> 23:51.461
THINK MIGHT BE REAL.

23:51.461 --> 23:53.463
I'M NOT IGNORING
THE FLASH-FORWARDS.

23:53.463 --> 23:56.466
I'M JUST NOT BRINGING THEM
INTO THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE.

23:56.466 --> 23:59.469
NOW CONSENT MR. NED FOR SURGERY
AND MEET ME IN THE O.R.

24:02.542 --> 24:05.044
OH, WITH ANY SURGERY,
THERE'S A RISK OF INFECTION,

24:05.044 --> 24:09.018
BLOOD LOSS, DRUG ALLERGY
AND EVEN DEATH, NED.

24:09.018 --> 24:10.980
IT'S AL GRAVY.

24:10.980 --> 24:14.053
(clicks pen)
YOU KNOW, IT'S OKAY
IF YOU'VE GOT QUESTIONS

24:14.053 --> 24:15.725
OR IF YOU'RE WORRIED.

24:15.725 --> 24:18.027
UH, THIS IS A MAJOR SURGERY.
I GET IT.

24:18.027 --> 24:20.029
YOU'RE TELLING ME I NEED

24:20.029 --> 24:22.492
SOME SORT
OF DRUG ALLERGY-DEATH SURGERY.

24:22.492 --> 24:24.534
I'M TOTALLY COOL WITH IT.

24:24.534 --> 24:26.536
I MEAN, I KNOW
IT SOUNDS WEIRD, BUT..

24:26.536 --> 24:28.568
SOME KIND OF CHANGE
IS HAPPENING.

24:28.568 --> 24:33.072
I MEAN, I DON'T FEEL NERVOUS
OR AFRAID OF, LIKE, ANYTHING.

24:33.072 --> 24:35.775
I MEAN, ALL THAT WORRYING
ALL THE TIME,

24:35.775 --> 24:37.246
IT'S JUST, LIKE,

24:37.246 --> 24:40.880
KEPT ME FROM BEING
THE ME I'M SUPPOSED TO BE.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.482
SIX MONTHS FROM NOW,
I SEE MYSELF,

24:43.482 --> 24:47.086
AND I'M, LIKE, THIS INVINCIBLE,
FEARLESS BLACK GUY,

24:47.086 --> 24:49.158
LIKE SHAFT OR BRYANT GUMBEL.

24:49.158 --> 24:52.692
AND KNOWING THAT...

24:52.692 --> 24:54.223
IT'S ALREADY CHANGED ME.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.072
(children laughing
and shouting indistinctly)

25:03.072 --> 25:06.576
(bell tolling)

25:06.576 --> 25:08.938
(door opens)
(man speaks indistinctly)

25:08.938 --> 25:10.109
OH.

25:10.109 --> 25:13.643
YES. YES, RABBI HIRSCHOLTZ.

25:13.643 --> 25:16.085
OH,
15 IN THE LAST 2 WEEKS.

25:16.085 --> 25:18.588
FOUR, UH, ON SUNDAY,
ACTUALLY.

25:18.588 --> 25:22.051
I DIDN'T LEAVE THE CEMETERY
UNTIL AFTER SUNDOWN. BYE.

25:22.051 --> 25:25.024
OH, I'M SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT EVERYTHING.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.627
I'VE BEEN SO BUSY
WITH EVERYTHING.

25:27.627 --> 25:29.899
SO HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

25:29.899 --> 25:31.200
I, UM...

25:31.200 --> 25:33.963
(crickets chirping)

25:33.963 --> 25:35.965
OH, I'M SOR-- (laughs)

25:35.965 --> 25:37.907
I KEEP CRICKETS.

25:37.907 --> 25:41.571
OH, I REALLY--I REALLY
LIKE THE WAY THEY SOUND.

25:41.571 --> 25:44.814
SO, PAIGE, YOU WERE SAYING?

25:44.814 --> 25:47.977
PAIGE IS MY SISTER.
I'M NICOLE.

25:47.977 --> 25:50.680
OH.
I ONLY COME ON CHRISTMAS

25:50.680 --> 25:51.981
AND SOMETIMES ON EASTER.

25:51.981 --> 25:53.983
BUT THAT'S GONNA CHANGE.

25:53.983 --> 25:56.055
I, UM, I WANNA HELP OUT.

25:56.055 --> 25:58.157
I WANNA START DOING
SOME VOLUNTEER WORK,

25:58.157 --> 26:00.229
IN THE MORNING
BEFORE I HAVE WORK AND--

26:00.229 --> 26:02.932
THAT'S GREAT. UH, BUT AS FAR
AS VOLUNTEER WORK GOES,

26:02.932 --> 26:04.293
WE ARE FULL UP.

26:04.293 --> 26:08.998
SEE, IN A CRISIS LIKE THIS,
PEOPLE--THEY REALLY WANNA...

26:08.998 --> 26:10.870
WELL, PEOPLE NEED TO HELP.

26:10.870 --> 26:15.975
UH, WHY DON'T YOU--WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

26:15.975 --> 26:17.977
(whoosh)

26:20.780 --> 26:24.083
HOW DO I ATONE FOR SOMETHING
I HAVEN'T DONE YET?

26:27.116 --> 26:28.317
UH...

26:28.317 --> 26:31.891
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,
I FELT LIKE I WAS BEING...

26:31.891 --> 26:33.062
PUNISHED.

26:33.062 --> 26:34.223
(whoosh)

26:34.223 --> 26:36.696
DO YOU THINK...

26:36.696 --> 26:38.698
DO YOU THINK
GOD MADE THIS HAPPEN?

26:41.600 --> 26:44.103
Y-Y-YOU KNOW, IT'S--
IT'S REALLY HARD TO BELIEVE

26:44.103 --> 26:48.037
THAT THERE'S NOT A DIVINE HAND
INVOLVED SOMEHOW.

26:48.037 --> 26:50.840
TELL YOU WHAT.

26:50.840 --> 26:56.045
THIS RIGHT HERE IS
AUDREY RIDGEWAY'S PHONE NUMBER.

26:56.045 --> 26:58.347
SHE IS
THE VOLUNTEER COORDINATOR.

26:58.347 --> 27:00.089
(rips paper)

27:00.089 --> 27:03.222
I HOPE SHE CAN HELP.
(sets down pen)

27:03.222 --> 27:05.725
HERE'S A T-SHIRT.
(clears throat)

27:05.725 --> 27:07.697
BYE.

27:07.697 --> 27:09.398
(door opens)

27:09.398 --> 27:12.231
(door closes)

27:12.231 --> 27:14.233
(typing)

27:31.751 --> 27:33.753
WHERE'S NED?
O.R. TOOK HIM.

27:33.753 --> 27:36.055
WHEN?
10, 15 MINUTES AGO.
WHAT'S WRONG?

27:36.055 --> 27:39.829
CALL THE O.R.
WE'RE ABOUT TO KILL OUR PATIENT.

27:46.736 --> 27:50.299
(monitor beeping steadily)

27:50.299 --> 27:52.101
DR. BENFORD,

27:52.101 --> 27:54.373
WE CAN'T OPERATE.

27:54.373 --> 27:57.376
I COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT.
I COULDN'T MAKE SENSE OF IT.

27:57.376 --> 28:01.080
BUT NOW I'VE GOT IT.
NED HAS ADDISON'S DISEASE.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.752
SURGERY COULD KILL HIM.

28:02.752 --> 28:04.884
IN THE BUS CRASH,
HE WAS CALM

28:04.884 --> 28:07.356
IN THE FACE
OF AN INSANE DISASTER.

28:07.356 --> 28:09.859
AND AGAIN TODAY, HE SPOKE
ABOUT HIS FLASH-FORWARD.

28:09.859 --> 28:14.023
OH, BRYCE, PLEASE.
AND AGAIN HE MENTIONED THAT
HE WAS WEIRDLY CALM AND BLACK.

28:14.023 --> 28:17.166
YOU BETTER SCRUB
IF YOU WANT IN ON THIS CASE.
IF HE'S GOT ADDISON'S,

28:17.166 --> 28:20.329
THEN HIS BODY IS MAKING MELANIN
COMPOUNDS INSTEAD OF ADRENALINE.

28:20.329 --> 28:23.302
THAT'S WHY HIS SKIN
IS GOING TO GET DARK.
YEAH. I KNOW WHAT
ADDISON'S DISEASE IS.

28:23.302 --> 28:25.805
AND WITHOUT ADRENALINE,

28:25.805 --> 28:27.807
HIS BODY CAN'T MOUNT
A PROPER STRESS RESPONSE.

28:27.807 --> 28:30.339
THAT'S WHY HE'S SO SERENE
IN THE FACE OF THIS SURGERY.
UGH! BRYCE! STOP!

28:30.339 --> 28:31.981
AND WITHOUT
THE STRESS HORMONES,

28:31.981 --> 28:35.084
HIS BODY WILL BE UNABLE
TO ADAPT TO SURGERY.

28:35.084 --> 28:38.387
NO, WITHOUT SURGERY HE'LL DIE.
HIS BLOOD PRESSURE WILL TANK
AND HE'LL DIE. LISTEN...

28:38.387 --> 28:40.920
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME.
IN HIS VISION, HE SAW--

28:40.920 --> 28:42.221
ENOUGH ABOUT VISIONS!

28:42.221 --> 28:43.923
HE NEEDS HYDROCORTISONE.

28:43.923 --> 28:45.925
NO, I'M NOT ADMINISTERING
A POTENTIALLY HARMFUL DRUG

28:45.925 --> 28:48.928
BECAUSE A PATIENT HAD
A FREAKY DREAM.
THESE AREN'T DREAMS.

28:48.928 --> 28:51.230
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU SAW,
AND I DON'T CARE.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.402
BUT IT IS AFFECTING
YOUR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT,

28:53.402 --> 28:57.066
AND IT NEEDS TO STOP.
HOW ABOUT
YOUR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT?

28:57.066 --> 29:00.039
EXCUSE ME?
COME ON, DR. BENFORD. YOU KNOW
WHY YOU DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE...

29:00.039 --> 29:03.112
OH, YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS, BRYCE.
IN YOUR FLASH-FORWARD.

29:03.112 --> 29:06.445
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF. YOU SAW
THE END OF YOUR MARRIAGE.
OH, YOU ARE SO OUT OF LINE,
DOCTOR.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.747
AND YOU STICKING YOUR HEAD
IN THE SAND

29:08.747 --> 29:11.450
IS GONNA END UP KILLING
OUR PATIENT.
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT'S GONNA
KILL OUR PATIENT?

29:11.450 --> 29:13.282
WASTING ANY MORE TIME ARGUING

29:13.282 --> 29:15.785
BECAUSE HE'S LYING ON THAT TABLE
CONTINUING TO BLEED.

29:15.785 --> 29:18.087
NOW THAT'S NOT FROM
A MAGIC 8 BALL OR A OUIJA BOARD

29:18.087 --> 29:20.089
OR SOME KIND OF VISION.

29:20.089 --> 29:23.762
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW,
THAT'S REAL.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.065
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T BOTHER SCRUBBING IN.

29:26.065 --> 29:29.468
(monitor continues beeping
steadily)

29:29.468 --> 29:33.542
(IKO's "Look What You've Done
to Me" playing)

29:33.542 --> 29:37.546
â™ª OH â™ª

29:37.546 --> 29:42.211
â™ª LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO ME â™ª

29:47.917 --> 29:50.119
â™ª I'M â™ª

29:50.119 --> 29:55.164
â™ª IN PIECES AROUND YOUR FEET â™ª

29:59.368 --> 30:03.102
â™ª AND NO â™ª

30:03.102 --> 30:07.576
â™ª DON'T TAKE BACK
WHAT YOU SAID â™ª

30:14.143 --> 30:17.386
â™ª SHE â™ª

30:17.386 --> 30:22.952
â™ª SHE'S ON AN AEROPLANE â™ª

30:26.395 --> 30:29.098
â™ª WHILE I â™ª

30:29.098 --> 30:33.863
â™ª YEAH, I JUST LEARNED
HOW TO STAY â™ª

30:36.235 --> 30:40.009
â™ª YEAH, IT'S ALL VERY WELL â™ª

30:40.009 --> 30:42.942
â™ª IT'S ALL VERY WELL â™ª

30:42.942 --> 30:46.916
â™ª BUT IS IT LOVE? â™ª

30:46.916 --> 30:51.150
â™ª OH â™ª

30:51.150 --> 30:56.025
â™ª LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO ME â™ª

30:56.025 --> 30:59.028
(monitor beeping steadily,
instruments clatter)

31:00.489 --> 31:03.562
(Olivia) RETRACT THE DUCT
A LITTLE MORE LATERALLY.

31:03.562 --> 31:05.194
SUCTION.

31:05.194 --> 31:07.196
(man) ANYONE MAKE IT
TO GRAND ROUNDS TODAY?

31:07.196 --> 31:09.198
THIS GUY FROM YALE SAYS

31:09.198 --> 31:11.200
HE CAN ENHANCE MEMORY
OF THE FLASH-FORWARDS

31:11.200 --> 31:13.903
USING A CALCINEURIN ANTAGONIST.
YEAH, I WAS THERE.
PRETTY COOL.

31:13.903 --> 31:16.045
(man) YEAH.
IRRIGATION, PLEASE.

31:16.045 --> 31:18.978
(monitor beeping rapidly)

31:18.978 --> 31:20.649
(man) B.P.'s 78 OVER 54.

31:20.649 --> 31:24.153
STAY CLEAR
OF THE HEPATIC ARTERY.
800 CCs OUT.

31:24.153 --> 31:26.885
GUYS, SYSTOLIC'S IN FREEFALL.
MUST BE ANOTHER BLEEDER
SOMEWHERE.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.487
OR SOME KIND OF FLUID SHIFT.

31:28.487 --> 31:31.660
GET ANOTHER UNIT
ON THE RAPID INFUSER.
(man) TRIBUTARY'S LIGATED.

31:31.660 --> 31:33.562
(woman) RUN OF 6.
(Olivia) 100 OF LIDO RIGHT AWAY.

31:33.562 --> 31:35.664
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)
HE'S IN V-TAC.

31:35.664 --> 31:37.997
(man) NO PULSE.
DAMN IT. CODE CART AND A MIG
OF EPI. LET'S GO! LET'S GO!

31:37.997 --> 31:40.029
(man) LIDO'S IN.

31:40.029 --> 31:42.201
WHERE'S THE CART?
WHERE'S THE CART?!
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

31:42.201 --> 31:45.334
(woman)
YOU'RE CHARGED FOR 360.

31:45.334 --> 31:47.136
(Olivia) CLEAR.
(paddles thunk)

31:47.136 --> 31:48.978
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

31:48.978 --> 31:50.139
NO CHANGE.

31:50.139 --> 31:52.041
GOING AGAIN.

31:52.041 --> 31:53.542
CLEAR.

32:04.223 --> 32:08.057
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

32:08.057 --> 32:11.600
(man) FOURTH EPI'S IN.
(Olivia) CHASE IT WITH LIDO.

32:11.600 --> 32:14.133
HE'S HAD FIVE ROUNDS.
AMIODARONE THEN.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.966
THIS MAKES NO SENSE.
THIS MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL.

32:16.966 --> 32:20.569
(woman) E.B.L.'s
HOLDING AROUND 850.
NO CARDIAC HISTORY.
BLEEDING'S CONTROLLED.

32:20.569 --> 32:23.112
THIS IS CRAZY.
I DON'T GET IT.

32:28.147 --> 32:31.150
100 MIGs OF HYDROCORTISONE.
I.V. PUSH.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.983
IT'S ADRENAL CRISIS.
HE'S GOT ADDISON'S DISEASE.

32:33.983 --> 32:36.025
WHAT? NOBODY BOTHERED
TO TELL ME THIS?

32:36.025 --> 32:39.358
HE HASN'T BEEN DIAGNOSED YET.
ADDISON'S WOULD EXPLAIN
THE LACK OF RESPONSE

32:39.358 --> 32:42.061
TO FLUIDS AND PRESSORS.
EXACTLY. HOLD COMPRESSIONS.

32:42.061 --> 32:45.134
HOLDING.

32:45.134 --> 32:48.137
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

32:50.439 --> 32:53.572
(beeping steadily)

32:53.572 --> 32:57.106
NORMAL SINUS.

32:57.106 --> 33:00.249
GOOD CAROTID.
NICE CATCH, DR. BENFORD.

33:06.615 --> 33:09.458
LET'S CLOSE HIM UP.

33:15.364 --> 33:18.527
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT AGENT NOH'S MURDER?

33:18.527 --> 33:21.100
HIS MURDER?

33:21.100 --> 33:23.702
SOMETHING FUNNY
ABOUT THAT?

33:23.702 --> 33:27.106
JUST THAT I KNEW HE DIDN'T
HAVE A FLASH-FORWARD.

33:27.106 --> 33:29.408
I HAD NO IDEA
HE WAS GONNA BE MURDERED...

33:29.408 --> 33:33.042
TILL NOW.
THEN HOW DID YOU KNOW
HE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING?

33:33.042 --> 33:35.514
BECAUSE YOUR PARTNER
POSTED IT ON THE INTERNET,

33:35.514 --> 33:38.016
BECAUSE EVERYONE
IN THIS OFFICE KNOWS.

33:38.016 --> 33:41.050
ANY PARTICULAR REASON WHY YOU
FELT THE NEED TO WASTE THE TIME

33:41.050 --> 33:43.052
OF THE AGENTS INVESTIGATING
THE BLACKOUT?

33:43.052 --> 33:46.295
IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, NOTHING
I TELL YOU WILL BE THE TRUTH.

33:46.295 --> 33:48.697
SO WHY PERSIST IN ASKING?

33:48.697 --> 33:51.060
ASKING QUESTIONS IS MY JOB.

33:51.060 --> 33:55.164
SO LET'S START
WITH A SIMPLE ONE.

33:55.164 --> 33:57.035
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE BLACKOUT?

33:57.035 --> 34:00.109
THAT'S NOT
A SIMPLE QUESTION.

34:00.109 --> 34:01.670
ALL RIGHT.

34:01.670 --> 34:04.173
YOU EVER BEEN TO SOMALIA?

34:04.173 --> 34:07.045
I CAN'T SAY
I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.218
WHAT ABOUT DETROIT?

34:09.218 --> 34:11.420
UTAH?

34:11.420 --> 34:15.154
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR ENERGY
ON WHAT CAUSED THE BLACKOUT,

34:15.154 --> 34:17.126
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE.

34:17.126 --> 34:20.789
YOU'RE IGNORING THE MOST
PROFOUND QUESTION OF ALL...

34:20.789 --> 34:24.263
WHY?

34:24.263 --> 34:26.635
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT A BLACK SWAN IS?

34:28.537 --> 34:32.771
IT'S A METAPHOR USED TO DESCRIBE
A HIGH-IMPACT EVENT...

34:32.771 --> 34:36.074
SOMETHING SO RARE
IT'S BEYOND THE NORMAL REALM

34:36.074 --> 34:37.806
OF HUMAN EXPECTATION.

34:37.806 --> 34:41.850
IT COMES FROM THE 17th CENTURY
WHEN SCIENTISTS ASSUMED

34:41.850 --> 34:44.583
THAT ALL SWANS WERE WHITE.
THEY WERE WRONG.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.555
FASCINATING.

34:46.555 --> 34:51.760
(speaks Farsi)

34:51.760 --> 34:58.267
"THERE'S A ROOM. A SMALL BOY
ENTERS WITH A CANDLE."

34:58.267 --> 34:59.798
WHAT IS THIS,
A BEDTIME STORY?

34:59.798 --> 35:01.600
IT'S A SUFI PARABLE.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.133
THE MAN IN THE ROOM,
REFERRING TO THE CANDLE,

35:04.133 --> 35:07.136
ASKS, "TELL ME WHERE
THIS LIGHT COMES FROM."

35:07.136 --> 35:09.608
AND THE BOY BLOWS OUT
THE CANDLE AND REPLIES,

35:09.608 --> 35:11.880
"IF YOU TELL ME
WHERE THIS LIGHT WENT,

35:11.880 --> 35:15.214
I'LL TELL YOU
WHERE IT COMES FROM."
CUTE.

35:15.214 --> 35:18.487
YOUR PARTNER IS RIGHT
ABOUT ONE THING--

35:18.487 --> 35:21.820
I COMMUNE WITH SOME
VERY DANGEROUS PEOPLE.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.793
I'M FRIENDS WITH THOSE
WILLING TO DON SUICIDE VESTS

35:24.793 --> 35:27.426
IN THE NAME OF IDEOLOGY.
I KNOW WHEN A MAN

35:27.426 --> 35:30.629
IS WILLING TO SACRIFICE
ANYTHING FOR HIS CAUSE,

35:30.629 --> 35:33.862
AND YOU'RE NOT THAT KIND
OF MAN, AGENT BENFORD.

35:33.862 --> 35:37.336
EVEN IF YOU WERE TO START
ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS,

35:37.336 --> 35:40.469
YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO DO WHAT
IT TAKES TO GET THE ANSWERS.

35:40.469 --> 35:43.572
YOU'RE THAT LITTLE BOY,
AGENT BENFORD...

35:43.572 --> 35:45.714
ALONE IN THE DARK.

35:52.781 --> 35:55.684
(typing)

35:55.684 --> 35:58.927
(electronic whir)

35:58.927 --> 36:00.259
(taps button)

36:00.259 --> 36:03.262
(typing)

36:08.697 --> 36:10.199
(taps button, beep)

36:10.199 --> 36:11.840
(electronic dings)

36:14.773 --> 36:16.875
(Mark) HEY, AL.
(knocks on door)

36:16.875 --> 36:18.877
HEY, MAN.

36:20.509 --> 36:22.951
REMEMBER THAT HACKER--

36:22.951 --> 36:26.355
MR. CHEETO DUST?

36:26.355 --> 36:29.218
GIVE HIM A CALL.

36:30.859 --> 36:32.521
YOU SURE?

36:36.595 --> 36:38.597
YEAH.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.932
IT'S TIME WE GOT
OUT OF THE DARK.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.213
ADDISON'S DISEASE?

36:55.213 --> 36:56.885
WHO'S ADDISON?

36:56.885 --> 37:00.749
WELL, HE WAS THE GUY
WHO DISCOVERED THE CONDITION.

37:00.749 --> 37:03.992
IT'S A HORMONAL IMBALANCE THAT
MAKES SURGERY VERY DANGEROUS.

37:03.992 --> 37:06.925
BUT, UH, LUCKILY,
DR. BENFORD REALIZED IT IN TIME

37:06.925 --> 37:09.528
AND GAVE YOU THE MEDICATION
THAT SAVED YOUR LIFE.

37:09.528 --> 37:12.961
WOW. THANKS, DR. VARLEY.

37:12.961 --> 37:15.664
HEY, WE SHOULD THANK YOU.
(pager beeps)

37:15.664 --> 37:19.237
YOUR FLASH-FORWARDS
HELPED US PIECE IT TOGETHER.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.810
IF YOU HADN'T TOLD US
WHAT YOU SAW,

37:21.810 --> 37:24.473
YOU MIGHT HAVE DIED
ON THE TABLE.
IT'S PRETTY COOL.

37:24.473 --> 37:28.747
I WASN'T AFRAID, BECAUSE
I DIDN'T NEED TO BE AFRAID.

37:28.747 --> 37:32.020
THE FUTURE SAVED ME.

37:36.455 --> 37:40.559
UH, NED'S CRIT IS--
IS STABLE.

37:44.493 --> 37:46.495
LOOK, ABOUT EARLIER,
I, UM--

37:46.495 --> 37:48.497
I WAS COMPLETELY
OUT OF LINE.

37:48.497 --> 37:52.040
YEAH.
BUT YOU WERE ALSO RIGHT.

37:52.040 --> 37:55.704
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SEE
WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH NED

37:55.704 --> 37:59.478
'CAUSE OF WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH ME, SO...

37:59.478 --> 38:02.551
LOOK, I-I-I GET IT.
IT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH ME.

38:02.551 --> 38:04.953
THAT'S WHAT
MADE ME BELIEVE HIM.

38:04.953 --> 38:07.956
MM-HMM.

38:07.956 --> 38:10.759
BRYCE, I HAVEN'T PUSHED YOU

38:10.759 --> 38:12.891
'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THE...

38:12.891 --> 38:15.924
(elevator bell dings)
ME STANDING ON THE PIER
WITH A GUN TO MY HEAD?

38:15.924 --> 38:17.866
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M HERE

38:17.866 --> 38:20.699
IF YOU WANT TO TALK.

38:20.699 --> 38:24.873
THANKS, DR. B., BUT, UH,
I'M GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

38:24.873 --> 38:27.376
YOU REALLY THINK
YOU'RE JUST OKAY NOW?

38:27.376 --> 38:29.037
I KNOW I AM.

38:29.037 --> 38:32.511
THE FUTURE SAVED ME.

38:32.511 --> 38:35.514
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

38:35.514 --> 38:37.346
OH, UH, DR. BENFORD?

38:37.346 --> 38:41.019
HEY.
I NEED YOU TO SIGN THE DISCHARGE
ON THE ROLLERBLADE GUY

38:41.019 --> 38:43.392
SO I CAN ROLL HIM
ON OUT OF HERE.
SURE.

38:43.392 --> 38:46.495
OH, AND DYLAN SIMCOE'S
WHITE COUNT SPIKED TO 19.

38:46.495 --> 38:49.758
HERE'S HIS C.V.C.
HE WAS TRANSFERRED
TO PHYSICAL THERAPY.

38:49.758 --> 38:52.861
CAN YOU GIVE IT
TO HIS ATTENDING?
THE CHIEF
TRANSFERRED HIM BACK.

38:52.861 --> 38:55.604
WHAT?
P.T.s SAID THEY COULDN'T
HANDLE THE ANTIBIOTICS,

38:55.604 --> 38:58.767
SO THE CHIEF PUT HIM
BACK ON YOUR SERVICE.

38:58.767 --> 39:01.840
ARE YOU OKAY, DR. BENFORD?

39:01.840 --> 39:04.643
YEAH. FINE.

39:04.643 --> 39:06.615
(door closes)

39:11.019 --> 39:13.552
HEY, NICOLE.

39:13.552 --> 39:14.883
(chuckles)

39:14.883 --> 39:17.426
UH, CHARLIE'S JUST UPSTAIRS
CHANGING INTO HER P.J.s.

39:17.426 --> 39:18.757
ALL RIGHT.

39:18.757 --> 39:20.589
UM, WE DID
SOME FINGER PAINTING,

39:20.589 --> 39:22.461
AND SHE'S ALL DONE
WITH HER HOMEWORK,

39:22.461 --> 39:25.434
AND, UH, WE KICKED AROUND
A SOCCER BALL, TOO.

39:25.434 --> 39:29.097
OH, AND SHE HAD ANTS ON A LOG
FOR A SNACK.
AND HOW ARE YOU DOING?

39:31.970 --> 39:34.473
I FEEL BAD FOR
DISAPPEARING ON YOU.

39:34.473 --> 39:37.446
EH, EVERYBODY DISAPPEARED
FOR A WHILE.

39:37.446 --> 39:40.709
SOME PEOPLE
AREN'T EVEN BACK YET.

39:40.709 --> 39:42.711
I GUESS I'M JUST
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

39:42.711 --> 39:44.853
WHY YOU GUYS
DIDN'T FIRE ME.

39:44.853 --> 39:47.616
NICOLE,
YOU'RE PART OF THE FAMILY.

39:52.090 --> 39:54.092
HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

39:54.092 --> 39:56.094
YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

39:56.094 --> 39:58.096
YOU CAN, YOU KNOW.

40:02.701 --> 40:04.703
WHAT'S WRONG?

40:07.936 --> 40:10.939
I SAW SOMEONE DROWNING ME.

40:10.939 --> 40:12.611
WHAT?

40:12.611 --> 40:15.984
I SAW SOMEONE DROWNING ME...

40:15.984 --> 40:18.416
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD.

40:18.416 --> 40:23.452
(whoosh)
I SAW SOMEONE DROWNING ME,
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND,

40:23.452 --> 40:26.555
BUT I-I FELT LIKE I DESERVED
WHAT WAS HAPPENING,

40:26.555 --> 40:30.959
LIKE I HAD DONE SOMETHING WRONG,
AND THERE'S NO OTHER WAY OUT.

40:30.959 --> 40:33.502
I SAW THE MAN'S FACE
WHO WAS DOING IT.

40:33.502 --> 40:36.134
HE PUSHED ME BACK DOWN,
AND...

40:36.134 --> 40:39.668
AND THEN I WAS JUST GONE.

40:39.668 --> 40:40.939
(whoosh)

40:40.939 --> 40:43.712
(voice breaking)
WHAT DID I DO

40:43.712 --> 40:45.974
THAT I THINK
I DESERVED GETTING KILLED?

40:45.974 --> 40:48.777
YOU DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
YOU SAW OR EVEN HOW YOU FELT.

40:48.777 --> 40:51.520
WHAT KIND OF PERSON DOESN'T
CARE THEY'RE BEING MURDERED?

40:51.520 --> 40:54.222
NICOLE,
I'VE KNOWN YOU A LONG TIME.

40:54.222 --> 40:57.526
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG,
AND YOU WON'T.

40:57.526 --> 41:00.028
TOMORROW I'M GONNA HAVE
A DETECTIVE FRIEND OF MINE

41:00.028 --> 41:01.890
FROM THE L.A.P.D.
COME TALK TO YOU.

41:01.890 --> 41:03.862
WE'RE NOT GONNA LET
ANYTHING BAD HAPPEN.

41:03.862 --> 41:07.596
I WANT TO DO WHATEVER I HAVE TO
TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE SAFE.

41:07.596 --> 41:09.167
ALL RIGHT?

41:09.167 --> 41:13.742
THAT PERSON
YOU THINK YOU SAW,

41:13.742 --> 41:16.174
THAT PERSON
YOU'RE WORRIED YOU MIGHT BE,

41:16.174 --> 41:18.907
THAT'S NOT YOU.

41:18.907 --> 41:22.881
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
TRY TO BELIEVE THAT?

41:25.253 --> 41:27.916
YEAH. I CAN TRY.

41:27.916 --> 41:30.058
GOOD.

41:30.058 --> 41:33.892
(Charlie) HEY, DADDY.
HEY! COME HERE, YOU. OH!

41:33.892 --> 41:37.195
MOONS OVER MIAMI. YOU IN?
I'M IN.

41:37.195 --> 41:40.599
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET STARTED.
ARE YOU STAYING?

41:40.599 --> 41:43.001
UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE TO GO.

41:43.001 --> 41:45.003
SHE'S STAYING.
BREAKFAST FOR DINNER?

41:45.003 --> 41:48.577
CAN'T BEAT THAT.

41:48.577 --> 41:52.140
COME ON. PLEASE?
SOUNDS GREAT.

41:52.140 --> 41:55.013
GET CRACKING THE EGGS,
PROFESSOR.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.514
OKAY.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.287
CAN I HAVE A BOWL, PLEASE?
ONE BOWL COMING RIGHT UP.

41:59.287 --> 42:00.949
OKAY.
HERE.

42:00.949 --> 42:03.121
(laughs) THAT'S SILLY.
HERE WE GO. OKAY.

42:03.121 --> 42:04.723
(chuckles)

42:04.723 --> 42:07.996
GAMANTA, McGILLICUTTY...

42:07.996 --> 42:09.958
FROG LEG!
(gasps)

42:09.958 --> 42:11.960
DO YOU WANT THE COIN BACK?

42:11.960 --> 42:14.733
YEAH!
SAY THE MAGIC WORDS THEN.

42:14.733 --> 42:17.966
(Dylan) FROG LEG,
McGILLICUTTY...

42:17.966 --> 42:20.639
(Debbie) SEE YOU TOMORROW,
DR. BENFORD.
GOOD NIGHT, DEB.

42:20.639 --> 42:22.540
GAMANTA, McGILLICUTTY,

42:22.540 --> 42:24.773
FROG LEG.
THERE YOU GO.

42:24.773 --> 42:26.775
DO IT AGAIN!

42:26.775 --> 42:29.978
I THINK MY JUNIOR MAGICIAN
HAS TO GET HIS STRENGTH UP

42:29.978 --> 42:33.081
BEFORE THE NEXT TRICK.
HOW ABOUT SOME DINNER?

42:33.081 --> 42:36.554
OKAY, DAD.

42:39.257 --> 42:41.960
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

42:41.960 --> 42:44.763
UH, YOU'RE THE, UM,
THE EYE OF NEWT SOUP, RIGHT?

42:46.935 --> 42:49.267
ALL RIGHT. CHICKEN IT IS.

42:49.267 --> 42:52.671
(cell phone rings)

42:52.671 --> 42:54.643
(ring)

42:54.643 --> 42:55.974
(ring)

42:55.974 --> 42:57.906
(ring)

42:57.906 --> 42:59.147
(ring)

42:59.147 --> 43:00.679
YEAH?

43:00.679 --> 43:02.681
We need to talk.

43:02.681 --> 43:04.683
YEAH, WELL,
I CAN'T RIGHT NOW.

43:04.683 --> 43:07.055
Well, I'm truly sorry
about that, Lloyd,

43:07.055 --> 43:10.058
BUT TALKING TO ME IS JUST ONE
OF THOSE LITTLE INCONVENIENCES

43:10.058 --> 43:12.060
YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO PUT UP WITH

43:12.060 --> 43:15.363
NOW THAT WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE SINGLE GREATEST DISASTER

43:15.363 --> 43:17.365
IN HUMAN HISTORY.
