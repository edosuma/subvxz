<i>Previously on "Blood drive"...</i>

00:03.491 --> 00:04.623
You okay?

00:04.625 --> 00:06.592
I may have triggered
a tracking device.

00:06.594 --> 00:07.860
<i>Go find Arthur.</i>

00:07.862 --> 00:09.762
<i>Make Heart pay
for what they've done.</i>

00:09.764 --> 00:13.165
Relax.
Put the cop act to rest.

00:13.167 --> 00:15.534
<i>Or are you afraid
you might just like</i>

00:15.536 --> 00:17.870
this little paradise
I've created?

00:17.872 --> 00:19.738
I felt like you had my back,

00:19.740 --> 00:21.640
like you were willing
to go dark with me.

00:21.642 --> 00:23.542
What the hell's
a soul reclamator?

00:23.544 --> 00:24.743
Sooner or later,

00:24.745 --> 00:26.512
the good cop
is gonna have to admit...

00:26.514 --> 00:28.547
He's a bad guy.

00:28.549 --> 00:30.716
<i>I'll save your pathetic
little lives</i>

00:30.718 --> 00:33.852
if you agree to go on one last
adventure with me.

00:33.854 --> 00:35.521
You get to get to the bottom

00:35.523 --> 00:37.656
<i>of this bizarre obsession
they have</i>

00:37.658 --> 00:39.825
<i>with you and your sister.</i>

00:43.631 --> 00:44.630
<i>You're not gonna answer?</i>

00:44.632 --> 00:46.465
<i>Don't do this to me.</i>

00:46.467 --> 00:48.434
<i>- It's a simple question.
- It's not.</i>

00:48.436 --> 00:49.835
- Favorite movie.
- I don't... I don't know.

00:49.837 --> 00:51.036
What do you mean,
you don't know?

00:51.038 --> 00:52.438
I don't know.
I don't...

00:52.440 --> 00:53.472
I-I don't watch any movies.

00:53.474 --> 00:54.573
What are you talk...

00:54.575 --> 00:55.774
Give me something.

00:55.776 --> 00:56.975
Um, uh, okay, here.

00:56.977 --> 00:59.044
Super easy.
Dogs or cats?

00:59.046 --> 01:00.679
Cats.

01:00.681 --> 01:02.614
Definitely cats.

01:03.884 --> 01:05.050
What do you have against dogs?

01:05.052 --> 01:06.218
Nothing. I...

01:06.220 --> 01:07.553
Look, I had a dog growing up.

01:07.555 --> 01:09.588
I had a black lab named Daisy.

01:09.590 --> 01:12.958
She was great,
but she hated Karma.

01:12.960 --> 01:16.462
She would growl at her,
and then one day, bam!

01:16.464 --> 01:17.963
She bit Karma right here.

01:17.965 --> 01:19.698
Pinned her down.

01:19.700 --> 01:21.467
She was only ten.

01:21.469 --> 01:22.468
Jesus.

01:22.470 --> 01:23.669
I wasn't there,

01:23.671 --> 01:24.837
but the neighbors saw it,
thank god,

01:24.839 --> 01:27.573
and pulled her off,
called the cops.

01:27.575 --> 01:30.676
They were coming
to put her down.

01:30.678 --> 01:32.878
Look, I knew it had
to happen, but...

01:32.880 --> 01:34.746
She was my dog,

01:34.748 --> 01:37.249
and I wasn't gonna let anyone
lay a hand on her.

01:37.251 --> 01:41.653
So I took her out to the quarry.

01:45.892 --> 01:47.025
Guess that's the first time

01:47.027 --> 01:49.962
I had to kill to protect Karma.

01:49.964 --> 01:53.031
Who'd have thought that'd become
my whole life, huh?

01:53.033 --> 01:55.000
What a lovely story,
but I was really hoping

01:55.002 --> 01:56.602
the "world's
greatest sister" bit

01:56.604 --> 01:57.970
would've ended
after Karma croaked.

01:59.740 --> 02:01.273
Asshole.
Succubus!

02:01.275 --> 02:02.708
It's not worth it.

02:02.710 --> 02:05.077
After today,
we're free and clear.

02:05.079 --> 02:06.612
Just one last little thing,

02:06.614 --> 02:07.980
and then we're done
with this asshole.

02:07.982 --> 02:09.047
Forever.

02:09.049 --> 02:10.749
Don't miss the turn.

02:11.752 --> 02:13.085
All right, coming through!

02:21.595 --> 02:23.695
If you try to run,

02:23.697 --> 02:25.931
the guards have orders
to shoot you down.

02:25.933 --> 02:28.700
Trust me, you won't want
to miss this.

02:28.702 --> 02:30.669
Run from what?

02:30.671 --> 02:31.970
Pull it through!

02:31.972 --> 02:34.673
Tonight we go live,
and I'm gonna put on

02:34.675 --> 02:37.009
the greatest show this crumbling
shit pile of a planet

02:37.011 --> 02:38.744
has ever seen.

02:38.746 --> 02:40.312
After tonight,

02:40.314 --> 02:42.080
he can't hurt us anymore.

02:59.733 --> 03:01.800
<i>Only one will leave.</i>

03:14.047 --> 03:15.347
Ridiculous.

03:15.349 --> 03:17.683
Every single time.

03:17.685 --> 03:18.717
Where's...

03:18.719 --> 03:19.885
You always move things

03:19.887 --> 03:21.653
every time I-i go away.

03:21.655 --> 03:22.955
Where... where's my... my...

03:22.957 --> 03:25.657
Oh.
Thank you.

03:25.659 --> 03:28.060
<i>Primo match starts

03:28.062 --> 03:30.929
My, my!

03:30.931 --> 03:33.732
What a surprise!

03:33.734 --> 03:35.033
You know, it's not
all that often

03:35.035 --> 03:38.136
we get you Heart bigwigs here
live and in person.

03:38.138 --> 03:40.105
You got Grace and Arthur back.

03:40.107 --> 03:41.707
I wouldn't miss it.

03:41.709 --> 03:44.042
Oh, you've stolen
this girl's Heart.

03:44.044 --> 03:45.077
Shut up.

03:45.079 --> 03:46.678
I didn't get where I am

03:46.680 --> 03:48.680
by letting pissant subordinates
defy me.

03:48.682 --> 03:50.816
I sent you to reprogramming.

03:50.818 --> 03:53.719
Mm, and yet here I am,

03:53.721 --> 03:58.690
on the big night
when we finally, finally go live

03:58.692 --> 04:02.928
with two a-list Blood drivers
the whole world can get wet for.

04:02.930 --> 04:05.897
And all of this because of me.

04:07.834 --> 04:09.868
Ask yourself this, slink.

04:09.870 --> 04:13.772
Why would I reward an employee
who undermined my authority

04:13.774 --> 04:16.875
and tested me
at every turn, hmm?

04:16.877 --> 04:19.810
I've had a change of Heart.

04:19.813 --> 04:21.813
We're not going live.

04:21.815 --> 04:24.416
Tonight's finale will be
broadcast internally

04:24.418 --> 04:27.419
throughout Heart enterprises
as usual.

04:27.421 --> 04:31.857
After that, we're terminating
your project.

04:31.859 --> 04:35.127
I beg your pardon?

04:35.129 --> 04:39.965
Tonight will be the final
episode of "Blood drive."

04:45.739 --> 04:47.072
you lie!

04:49.142 --> 04:52.244
Entertainment's old news.

04:52.246 --> 04:55.180
If you attended any of
Alexandria's marketing meetings,

04:55.182 --> 04:57.716
you'd know that
the Blood drive powerpoint

04:57.718 --> 05:00.786
revealed something
very important.

05:00.788 --> 05:02.154
Powerpoint?

05:02.156 --> 05:04.289
- It's like a fancy slide show.
- Mm-hmm.

05:04.291 --> 05:06.892
With a projector, and they
plug it into a computer,

05:06.894 --> 05:09.828
and then they...
Heart is a global leader

05:09.830 --> 05:11.163
with a global footprint,

05:11.165 --> 05:13.965
so we're gonna be
a "thought starter"

05:13.967 --> 05:17.903
in the newest industry that
people really do care about:

05:17.905 --> 05:19.304
Politics.

05:25.946 --> 05:27.779
Asshole.

05:27.781 --> 05:31.783
If this really is to be
"Blood drive's" swan song,

05:31.785 --> 05:34.186
I say we shoot for the moon.

05:34.188 --> 05:37.923
<i>VIP areas are strictly
off-limits to racers</i>

05:37.925 --> 05:40.926
<i>from Libya, Iraq, Syria,</i>

05:40.928 --> 05:45.197
<i>Yemen, Sudan, Iran, and Somalia.</i>

05:45.199 --> 05:46.832
What?

05:48.736 --> 05:49.835
What?

05:55.509 --> 05:58.076
<i>Attention.
Attention, all personnel.</i>

05:58.078 --> 06:01.146
<i>Prepare for immediate arrival
at portal one.</i>

06:13.960 --> 06:15.894
Who the hell are these assholes?

06:17.263 --> 06:19.131
And what's with
the space vagina?

06:19.133 --> 06:21.366
<i>Now arriving via blood gate one,</i>

06:21.368 --> 06:26.071
<i>incoming Blood drivers
from Portugal, Germany...</i>

06:27.107 --> 06:30.542
<i>Zimbabwe, Afghanistan...</i>

06:30.544 --> 06:32.043
I can't believe this.

06:32.045 --> 06:34.079
Must be 40 or 50 races' worth
of drivers here.

06:34.081 --> 06:35.981
I'm the champion!

06:35.983 --> 06:38.784
You want to come through me,
you got to get through me!

06:38.786 --> 06:40.185
This is so much bigger
than we thought.

06:40.187 --> 06:42.788
You're on!

06:42.790 --> 06:45.157
These last few days,
it's like we're finally...

06:45.159 --> 06:48.193
- In sync.
- In sync again.

06:48.195 --> 06:52.264
I can't believe we wasted
all that money on therapists.

06:52.266 --> 06:54.266
Do you remember the last one?

06:54.268 --> 06:56.234
I definitely remember the mess.

06:57.304 --> 06:59.137
We didn't need any of that.

06:59.139 --> 07:01.840
We just needed to listen
to each other.

07:03.877 --> 07:05.277
Excuse me.

07:05.279 --> 07:08.413
All your metal things
are gonna scratch the paint.

07:08.415 --> 07:11.082
She makes me put a lot of work
into this car.

07:13.152 --> 07:14.386
Hey!

07:14.388 --> 07:16.388
What's the point?

07:16.390 --> 07:18.590
The race is over after tonight.

07:18.592 --> 07:20.325
Heart's pulling the plug.

07:20.327 --> 07:22.060
Slink's given up.

07:22.062 --> 07:23.328
<i>In case of an emergency,</i>

07:23.330 --> 07:25.096
<i>the lights will be turned off</i>

07:25.098 --> 07:27.866
<i>and all exits will be sealed.</i>

07:27.868 --> 07:30.101
Did you hear that?

07:30.103 --> 07:31.870
Yeah.

07:31.872 --> 07:33.605
Race is over.

07:33.607 --> 07:35.273
Good.

07:35.275 --> 07:37.943
We can focus on ourselves again.

07:37.945 --> 07:40.178
You can finally finish
that project in the basement.

07:42.115 --> 07:44.616
They're probably dead by now.

07:44.618 --> 07:48.186
But this is like
a whole new life for us.

07:48.188 --> 07:51.056
What if, when it's
all over, we...

07:51.058 --> 07:53.358
Just go back to the way we were?

08:01.901 --> 08:04.936
<i>Attention.
Attention, please.</i>

08:04.938 --> 08:07.372
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

08:33.667 --> 08:36.967
<i>choose your weapon,

09:14.141 --> 09:18.009

make me do...

09:18.011 --> 09:19.511

10:18.772 --> 10:21.206
<i>In 2,138 miles,</i>

10:21.208 --> 10:23.074

Hey, pretty lady.
Need a ride?

10:54.641 --> 10:56.374
What are you doing here?

10:58.444 --> 11:00.545
I couldn't leave.

11:00.547 --> 11:02.480
Not without you.

11:06.119 --> 11:09.821
I'm going back to trash
your proximity sensor.

11:09.823 --> 11:11.156
Want to come?

11:11.158 --> 11:13.158
I can't ask you to do that.

11:13.160 --> 11:15.060
They'll be looking for us.

11:15.062 --> 11:16.327
You said it yourself,
we'd be walking

11:16.329 --> 11:17.662
into the belly of the beast.

11:17.664 --> 11:21.099
Yeah, but you're worth it.

11:26.139 --> 11:29.240
I'm experiencing so many
new feelings right now.

11:32.679 --> 11:34.446
Me too, baby.

11:34.448 --> 11:36.147
Me too.

11:36.149 --> 11:38.149
Now let's go set you free.

You don't have

14:01.962 --> 14:03.628
I'm not gonna fight you.

14:31.925 --> 14:33.658
I'm not gonna do it.

14:37.464 --> 14:38.896
I won't kill anyone!

14:42.569 --> 14:45.270
Look at yourselves.

14:45.272 --> 14:48.506
This is what you do
with your power?

14:48.508 --> 14:52.844
Kane hill, fracking tubes,

14:52.846 --> 14:55.713
murder cars?

14:55.715 --> 14:58.750
This world has problems
that you can fix,

14:58.752 --> 15:01.686
and you sit around watching
this spectacle

15:01.688 --> 15:04.689
like some kind of...

15:04.691 --> 15:08.693
Death perverts!

15:08.695 --> 15:11.696
I was willing to let this go.

15:11.698 --> 15:14.499
I was gonna move on.

15:14.501 --> 15:18.569
But now...

15:18.571 --> 15:21.506
You're all under arrest!

15:27.947 --> 15:30.315
<i>That's quite the speech,
pretty boy.</i>

15:31.684 --> 15:33.785
<i>But if you refuse to kill,</i>

15:33.787 --> 15:36.688
<i>then we'll just have
to properly motivate you.</i>

15:36.690 --> 15:38.523
<i>And I've got
just the thing to do it.</i>

15:38.525 --> 15:39.757
<i>Shut up, slink.</i>

15:48.668 --> 15:49.734
Arthur.

15:49.736 --> 15:50.868
Grace!

15:55.802 --> 15:57.603
When I get out of here,

15:57.605 --> 15:59.071
I'm gonna strangle you
with your own intestines.

15:59.073 --> 16:00.873
<i>Ooh, we haven't seen that
this season.</i>

16:00.875 --> 16:02.408
<i>Shut the fuck up.</i>

16:03.810 --> 16:05.677
<i>I press this button,</i>

16:05.679 --> 16:06.945
<i>and your little girlfriend's</i>

16:06.947 --> 16:08.680
<i>burnt on the outside</i>

16:08.682 --> 16:10.749
<i>and pink in the center, champ.</i>

16:10.751 --> 16:13.085
Why? Huh?

16:13.087 --> 16:14.720
Why me?

16:14.722 --> 16:16.955
You kidnap my sister
to force me to race.

16:16.957 --> 16:18.824
Then you hound me
but don't give a shit

16:18.826 --> 16:21.160
when the other racers
bend the rules.

16:21.162 --> 16:23.829
What the fuck could you have
against me?

16:23.831 --> 16:26.832
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

16:26.834 --> 16:29.968
<i>What could anyone have
against you, Grace?</i>

16:31.938 --> 16:34.640
<i>All you did was...</i>

16:34.642 --> 16:37.609
<i>Abandon your sister,</i>

16:37.611 --> 16:40.846
<i>left her to die
in some institution</i>

16:40.848 --> 16:43.649
<i>like she was nothing.</i>

16:47.620 --> 16:51.056
Why Grace d'Argento?

16:51.058 --> 16:52.958
Who could have any reason

16:52.960 --> 16:56.762
to hate sweet, sweet Grace?

16:58.865 --> 17:01.133
It's finally my turn.

17:02.136 --> 17:03.168
When you're gone,

17:03.170 --> 17:05.204
it'll all be about me.

17:10.844 --> 17:14.813
For once in my life, I can be me

17:14.815 --> 17:17.648
without being overshadowed
by you.

17:57.790 --> 17:58.924
Oh, my god.

18:11.938 --> 18:13.972
Karma?

18:17.546 --> 18:19.147
Karma.

18:19.149 --> 18:21.149
I thought you were dead.

18:21.151 --> 18:22.517
You wish.

18:22.519 --> 18:24.986
I would never wish that.

18:24.988 --> 18:26.120
You will.

18:27.791 --> 18:28.957
<i>Whoo!</i>

18:30.526 --> 18:31.926
Fight...

18:31.928 --> 18:33.094
Or she dies.

18:34.264 --> 18:35.897
<i>Wow, wow!</i>

18:35.899 --> 18:38.233
<i>What an...
What an amazing twist,</i>

18:38.235 --> 18:40.001
<i>ladies and gentlemen!</i>

18:40.003 --> 18:42.537
<i>Never a dull moment here
on "Blood drive."</i>

18:42.539 --> 18:46.641
<i>Speaking of which,
let's begin round two!</i>

18:51.914 --> 18:52.914
<i>Really?</i>

18:54.818 --> 18:57.519
<i>Round two is brought to you
by the Heart enterprises</i>

18:57.521 --> 19:00.288
<i>gas-powered trimmer
with titanium blades:</i>

19:00.290 --> 19:03.558
<i>The Bladenado.</i>

19:03.560 --> 19:04.959
<i>Really?</i>

19:04.961 --> 19:06.194
<i>What an awesome name.</i>

19:06.196 --> 19:08.196
People are constantly asking me,

19:08.198 --> 19:09.264
"Harriet, what do you love

19:09.266 --> 19:10.932
"about owning Heart enterprise"

19:10.934 --> 19:13.034
gas-powered trimmer
with titanium blades?"

19:13.036 --> 19:14.936
And I tell them, "cleanup."

19:14.938 --> 19:16.538
Here, let me show you.

19:16.540 --> 19:17.672
But first we're gonna have

19:17.674 --> 19:19.073
to get it good and dirty.

19:27.551 --> 19:30.118
<i>The Bladenado gas-powered
trimmer with titanium blades,</i>

19:30.120 --> 19:32.053
<i>from Heart enterprises.</i>

19:32.055 --> 19:33.888
The computer mainframe.

19:33.890 --> 19:36.157
If there's a way to turn off
my proximity sensors,

19:36.159 --> 19:38.126
it'll be beyond that door.

19:38.128 --> 19:39.561
Ugh.

19:39.563 --> 19:41.296
I hate computers.

19:42.965 --> 19:45.967
- Babe!
- Not you.

19:45.969 --> 19:48.570
Sorry.

19:48.572 --> 19:51.339
Our odds of success
are lower than half of 1%.

19:51.341 --> 19:53.675
Just look at all the cameras
surrounding it.

19:53.677 --> 19:56.978
And there are retina scans,
palm scans, voice ids,

19:56.980 --> 19:59.647
all tied directly
into the mainframe.

19:59.649 --> 20:02.951
It's nation-state-level
security.

20:02.953 --> 20:04.986
Yeah, but you forgot something.

20:04.988 --> 20:07.021
Security guards
are dumb as shit.

20:08.992 --> 20:12.594
Babe, two days ago,
you were a security guard.

20:15.064 --> 20:17.198
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

20:24.040 --> 20:31.079
Torrent downloaded from RARBG

20:39.254 --> 20:42.156
Karma, I love you.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.158
You don't have to do
any of this.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.027
I love you too, sis.

20:46.029 --> 20:47.228
Enjoying the show?

21:00.943 --> 21:02.110
Look.

21:02.112 --> 21:05.113
I don't know why
you were a dude.

21:05.115 --> 21:07.181
And we can talk
about that later.

21:07.183 --> 21:08.349
But I get why you're angry.

21:08.351 --> 21:10.318
Just please, please,
I hope you understand

21:10.320 --> 21:13.421
that I-i didn't know
what to do.

21:13.423 --> 21:15.056
Do you know
what their favorite form

21:15.058 --> 21:17.258
of treatment is at Kane hill?

21:17.260 --> 21:18.660
Shock therapy.

21:18.662 --> 21:21.796
Every morning
right after breakfast.

21:21.798 --> 21:23.231
A little scrambled eggs,

21:23.233 --> 21:25.266
a little pissing in your pants.

21:25.268 --> 21:28.269
Karma, you were addicted to red.

21:28.271 --> 21:30.204
I didn't know what else to do.

21:30.206 --> 21:31.439
You nearly died in my arms.

21:31.441 --> 21:35.076
They tied me to a bed
and tortured me.

21:35.078 --> 21:36.377
And every day,
all I could think of

21:36.379 --> 21:39.013
was how my own flesh and blood

21:39.015 --> 21:40.048
threw me away.

21:40.050 --> 21:42.016
You were out of control, okay?

21:42.018 --> 21:44.152
It's like you weren't even
my sister anymore.

21:44.154 --> 21:47.055
Do I look out of control, Grace?

21:47.057 --> 21:49.757
All of this, it's because of me.

21:56.031 --> 21:58.132
You traitor.

21:58.134 --> 22:02.103
I swear I'm gonna...
- Do what?

22:02.105 --> 22:04.272
Where are your $10 words now,
Julian?

22:04.274 --> 22:06.274
How dare you?

22:06.276 --> 22:08.242
I build a world
for you to ravish,

22:08.244 --> 22:10.845
and this is how you repay me?

22:10.847 --> 22:13.414
I swear I will make you bathe

22:13.416 --> 22:18.386
in all the pain and fuckery
your Heart can bear.

22:18.388 --> 22:20.755
Oh, that gives me an idea.

22:23.727 --> 22:26.461
Blood drive was the best way
to make you pay.

22:26.463 --> 22:29.063
All I had to do was bark
a few orders at slink,

22:29.065 --> 22:30.231
make him jump,

22:30.233 --> 22:32.233
make your life a living hell.

22:32.235 --> 22:34.168
Karma d'Argento!

22:40.410 --> 22:42.143
Ah!

22:42.145 --> 22:45.813
I have to admit,
you had even me fooled.

22:45.815 --> 22:49.117
Had I known you were just
a miserable

22:49.119 --> 22:51.085
red-addicted gutter tramp,

22:51.087 --> 22:53.154
I never would have jumped
through all those hoops for you.

22:53.156 --> 22:54.322
What do you want now?

22:54.324 --> 22:56.357
This.

23:03.767 --> 23:05.133
What are you doing?

23:05.135 --> 23:07.301
Something you never understood.

23:07.303 --> 23:10.304
In order to create great drama,

23:10.306 --> 23:12.840
one must heighten the stakes,

23:12.842 --> 23:14.342
raise the jeopardy,

23:14.344 --> 23:16.544
put characters at risk.

23:20.450 --> 23:21.482
You're right.

23:21.484 --> 23:23.151
It's not quite good enough

23:23.153 --> 23:24.786
for a commercial break.

23:32.896 --> 23:33.995
That ought to do it.

23:49.786 --> 23:51.419
You okay?

23:51.421 --> 23:52.953
Peachy.
Watch out!

23:59.896 --> 24:01.128
Okay, okay.

24:01.130 --> 24:02.130
- All right?
- Yeah.

24:13.710 --> 24:16.210
Good-bye, sweet prince.

24:19.448 --> 24:21.916
Seriously... Good-bye.

24:37.734 --> 24:38.966
<i>Ooh!</i>

24:38.968 --> 24:41.902
<i>You see, ladies and gentlemen?</i>

24:41.904 --> 24:44.972
<i>Now, that is what "Blood drive"
is all about:</i>

24:44.974 --> 24:48.409
<i>Bringing people together.</i>

24:48.411 --> 24:50.978
<i>Let's set the mood.</i>

24:53.750 --> 24:55.483
Vienna.

24:55.485 --> 24:57.151
How could I forget?

24:57.153 --> 24:58.853
The dinner.

24:58.855 --> 24:59.887
The dancing.

24:59.889 --> 25:01.188
The drowning.

25:01.190 --> 25:03.190
The helpless gurgles
of their screams.

25:05.161 --> 25:07.762
Stop time with me.

25:07.764 --> 25:10.030
Let's make this moment
last forever.

25:12.135 --> 25:13.968
Last chance!

25:26.215 --> 25:27.215
Ha!

25:32.922 --> 25:34.555
I want you so bad right now.

25:34.557 --> 25:36.924
Bad is the only way
I want it right now.

25:36.926 --> 25:39.493
I never want this moment to end.

25:39.495 --> 25:43.097
I won't let us go back
to the way we were.

25:43.099 --> 25:44.565
We don't have to.

25:46.235 --> 25:49.069
I never wanted anyone
to kill me but you.

26:25.908 --> 26:30.277
This is the greatest
achievement of my life.

26:35.051 --> 26:36.617
- Whoa.
- Howdy doody, fellas.

26:36.619 --> 26:39.220
This Aki unit tells me
you're having computer problems.

26:39.222 --> 26:40.354
What computer problems?

26:40.356 --> 26:41.956
The ISP switched the modem IP

26:41.958 --> 26:43.858
on router port 9,000,

26:43.860 --> 26:45.960
which has bisected
the packet distribution

26:45.962 --> 26:48.562
and is causing the old man's
console to flicker.

26:49.931 --> 26:51.966
Yeah.

26:51.968 --> 26:53.133
Sounds about right.

27:09.886 --> 27:10.951
Whoa.

27:13.589 --> 27:15.623
Karma, you saw the race.

27:15.625 --> 27:17.057
Everything I did, I did for you,

27:17.059 --> 27:18.125
to save your life!

27:18.127 --> 27:19.260
I already had a life!

27:19.262 --> 27:21.028
You took that from me!

27:21.030 --> 27:23.998
You left me for a fucking boy,
Grace.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.033
First the Primo, then Arthur.

27:26.035 --> 27:28.202
Jesus Christ,
his name is Arthur!

27:28.204 --> 27:29.270
What is he, like, 40?

27:30.940 --> 27:32.206
At the Amazon camp,

27:32.208 --> 27:34.008
when I thought you were dead,

27:34.010 --> 27:36.076
I didn't want to live in a world
without you.

27:37.112 --> 27:38.279
I still don't.

27:38.281 --> 27:39.346
Please.

27:41.683 --> 27:43.384
That works for me.

27:52.328 --> 27:55.229
Grace!

28:00.703 --> 28:02.703
Oh, my god.

28:07.343 --> 28:09.143
It's beautiful.

28:09.145 --> 28:10.444
It's like...

28:10.446 --> 28:13.714
Nothing I could have
possibly planned.

28:41.276 --> 28:43.077
Emerge.

28:50.452 --> 28:53.354
Emerge, my beautiful butterfly.

28:53.356 --> 28:56.090
Emerge!

28:56.092 --> 28:57.224
Do it.

28:58.460 --> 29:00.260
Pick it up.

29:07.203 --> 29:08.669
Pick it up!

29:10.206 --> 29:11.438
Do it.

29:13.308 --> 29:14.308
Do it.

29:19.749 --> 29:25.219
Blood drive!

29:59.789 --> 30:00.821
Arthur, no! I'm alive!

30:14.999 --> 30:17.267
Grace has taken the lead!

30:17.269 --> 30:18.969
But captain Clowndick's
gaining on us!

30:18.971 --> 30:20.437
- Ribbone lost control!
- He must be fucking hammered!

30:20.439 --> 30:22.172
Blood drive!

30:22.174 --> 30:23.540
<i>Bring the fun and excitement</i>

30:23.542 --> 30:25.375
<i>of America's number one
blood sport home</i>

30:25.377 --> 30:27.310
<i>with all your favorites:
Ribbone...</i>

30:27.312 --> 30:29.112
Yeah!

30:29.114 --> 30:30.313
<i>Domi and Cliff...</i>

30:30.315 --> 30:33.450
<i>Even slink, with real
top hat action.</i>

30:33.452 --> 30:34.484
<i>- Cool!
- And of course,</i>

30:34.486 --> 30:36.519
<i>everyone's favorites,
<i>Arthur and Grace.</i></i>

30:36.521 --> 30:38.521
Yeah!

30:38.523 --> 30:40.256
I was born to kill.

30:40.258 --> 30:42.359
<i>Collect them all.
From Heart Enterprises.</i>

30:42.361 --> 30:44.127
Arthur, don't succumb
to the darkness.

30:45.073 --> 30:48.274
It has me, Grace.
It has me.

30:55.116 --> 30:57.016
What are you doing?

30:57.018 --> 30:59.385
I'm having trouble disabling
my proximity sensors.

30:59.387 --> 31:01.120
We don't have much time.

31:01.122 --> 31:03.289
It won't take Heart long
to realize we're here.

31:03.291 --> 31:05.358
There's some kind
of interference,

31:05.360 --> 31:08.428
so I'm doing a backup of all
of Heart project databases

31:08.430 --> 31:12.565
and building schematics
so I can cross-reference them.

31:12.567 --> 31:14.133
I found the problem.

31:14.135 --> 31:16.402
Something called the SR unit.

31:16.404 --> 31:18.571
It's sucking all the energy
out of the system.

31:42.396 --> 31:44.597
What the hell is that?

32:09.057 --> 32:12.091
He's really something, isn't he?

32:12.093 --> 32:15.228
Such a natural killer.

32:15.230 --> 32:17.497
I can see why you like him.

32:17.499 --> 32:21.234
He's sick upstairs.

32:21.236 --> 32:23.036
Like us.

32:25.806 --> 32:30.510
I've had a lot of time to think
about how things got so shitty.

32:32.379 --> 32:35.381
At first, I hated the guy
who got me hooked on red.

32:35.383 --> 32:39.619
Then I hated the hospital staff
for fucking me up even more.

32:39.621 --> 32:45.191
Then I realized that none
of that even matters

32:45.193 --> 32:49.195
because you did this to me.

32:49.197 --> 32:53.132
This one time
when I was, like, ten,

32:53.134 --> 32:55.535
you were so busy making out
with some asshole on the couch,

32:55.537 --> 32:59.138
so I snuck out
to teach you a lesson.

32:59.140 --> 33:00.673
Yeah, you were definitely
a pain in the ass.

33:00.675 --> 33:02.408
I remember that much.

33:02.410 --> 33:04.410
If the cops caught me
in the street,

33:04.412 --> 33:06.145
they would have brought me
back home,

33:06.147 --> 33:08.648
found out that mom and dad
were gone,

33:08.650 --> 33:11.417
and that I was being raised
by a total bitch.

33:11.419 --> 33:12.652
Oh.

33:12.654 --> 33:15.121
But look at how well
you turned out.

33:21.863 --> 33:24.397
I wasn't talking about you.

33:24.399 --> 33:27.100
Do you know who stopped me?

33:27.102 --> 33:28.634
Daisy.

33:28.636 --> 33:31.170
She came out of the shadows,
growling,

33:31.172 --> 33:33.606
and I practically shit my pants.

33:33.608 --> 33:36.175
She chased me back inside.

33:36.177 --> 33:38.478
A fucking dog

33:38.480 --> 33:41.114
was better at raising me
than you.

33:42.316 --> 33:43.616
I loved that dog.

33:43.618 --> 33:46.219
Yeah, I seem to remember it
a little differently.

33:46.221 --> 33:48.321
At least she didn't
throw me away

33:48.323 --> 33:49.722
like a piece of trash!

33:57.899 --> 34:02.201
First you get to watch
your boyfriend lose his mind.

34:02.203 --> 34:04.337
Then you get to watch me
kill him.

34:04.339 --> 34:06.606
Then after that...

34:06.608 --> 34:10.676
Well, I'd hate to ruin
the surprise.

34:24.359 --> 34:26.192
Our father, who art in heaven,

34:26.194 --> 34:27.393
hallowed be thy name.

34:27.395 --> 34:29.295
Thy kingdom come...

34:53.754 --> 34:56.755
I think it makes hats.

34:58.660 --> 35:01.394
<i>This man is putting on
a clinic, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

35:01.396 --> 35:04.564
<i>This is textbook slaughter!</i>

35:04.566 --> 35:05.698
No!

35:11.539 --> 35:13.339
You like that?

35:13.341 --> 35:14.574
Huh?

35:14.576 --> 35:16.542
You like that, you sick fucks?

35:22.316 --> 35:23.549
Arthur.

35:28.456 --> 35:30.723
You're the one, huh?

35:30.725 --> 35:33.492
You're the one
that caused all this?

35:35.462 --> 35:38.364
Lot of trouble
for a little girl.

35:39.733 --> 35:42.301
Dynamite comes
in small packages.

35:42.303 --> 35:43.369
Ugh.

35:43.371 --> 35:46.239
<i>A picture-perfect ending</i>

35:46.241 --> 35:48.808
<i>to a fairy-tale season.</i>

35:48.810 --> 35:50.543
<i>Arthur Bailey, the fucking cop,</i>

35:50.545 --> 35:52.712
<i>squares off
against Karma d'Argento,</i>

35:52.714 --> 35:54.614
<i>my deceitful bitch of a boss!</i>

36:05.692 --> 36:08.327
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

36:08.329 --> 36:12.698
<i>just one thing stands
between Arthur Bailey</i>

36:12.700 --> 36:16.335
<i>and victory!</i>

36:16.337 --> 36:18.838
<i>Fight!</i>

36:24.125 --> 36:26.058
Thanks a lot, buddy,
but I got this.

36:26.060 --> 36:28.694
Don't hurt him!

36:28.696 --> 36:30.863
Don't hurt him!

36:38.039 --> 36:41.006
You have the power
to stop all this.

36:41.008 --> 36:43.142
I know you think I failed you,

36:43.144 --> 36:44.977
but if you do this,
we'll lose each other forever.

36:44.979 --> 36:45.979
Please.

36:51.818 --> 36:54.086
Please.

37:07.968 --> 37:09.268
You did this to us!

37:15.242 --> 37:17.243
I'm never gonna stop, Grace,

37:17.245 --> 37:20.112
not until everything you love
is gone!

37:23.083 --> 37:24.149
I know.

37:31.759 --> 37:36.095
<i>Warning.
Reclamation now in progress.</i>

37:36.097 --> 37:38.130
What the hell is this thing?
Aki!

37:38.132 --> 37:39.832
- Almost done.
- We need to go now!

37:39.834 --> 37:41.166
<i>- Warning.
- Finished.</i>

37:41.168 --> 37:44.270
<i>Reclamation
now in progre-gre-gress.</i>

37:44.272 --> 37:46.805
<i>Warning. Warning.</i>

37:46.807 --> 37:48.007
<i>Warning.</i>

38:00.820 --> 38:01.987
Arthur.

38:03.957 --> 38:05.190
That's enough.

38:06.227 --> 38:07.626
I'm alive.

38:09.329 --> 38:10.829
It's over.

38:19.140 --> 38:21.273
No, it's not.

38:23.978 --> 38:27.246
<i>And then there were two!</i>

38:27.248 --> 38:31.050
<i>Only one thing remains,</i>

38:31.052 --> 38:34.620
<i>and that is to crown</i>

38:34.622 --> 38:38.891
<i>this year's Primo!</i>

38:40.094 --> 38:42.328
We did that one last thing
you wanted.

38:42.330 --> 38:45.364
That was the deal.
We're done.

38:50.003 --> 38:52.338
Let's get the hell out of here.

38:52.340 --> 38:54.206
I'm not going anywhere.

38:54.208 --> 38:57.242
<i>These two lovebirds
are partners no more!</i>

38:58.379 --> 39:01.313
<i>Now they must fight</i>

39:01.315 --> 39:03.983
<i>until but one remains,</i>

39:03.985 --> 39:05.050
<i>our champion,</i>

39:05.052 --> 39:06.952
<i>our Primo!</i>

39:06.954 --> 39:08.187
You heard the man.

39:08.189 --> 39:09.989
Arthur, you're not
thinking straight.

39:09.991 --> 39:12.224
There can only be one Primo.

39:21.202 --> 39:23.035
<i>Iadies and gentlemen,</i>

39:23.037 --> 39:24.387
<i>ladies and gentlemen,
I believe...</i>

39:25.373 --> 39:27.973
<i>Yes! Yes!</i>

39:27.975 --> 39:29.274
<i>It is a forfeit!</i>

39:29.276 --> 39:31.076
<i>It is a forfeit!
It's over!</i>

39:31.078 --> 39:35.981
<i>And it's all over!</i>

39:35.983 --> 39:38.117
<i>There's no denying it.</i>

39:38.119 --> 39:40.252
<i>I am an artist.</i>

39:41.422 --> 39:45.290
<i>And this is my finest work.</i>

40:40.481 --> 40:44.149
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I give you</i>

40:44.151 --> 40:49.154
<i>the new Blood drive Primo:</i>

40:49.156 --> 40:52.324
<i>Arthur Bailey!</i>

41:15.148 --> 41:18.183
Primo! Primo! Primo!

41:23.791 --> 41:25.758
Primo! Primo!

41:30.531 --> 41:33.365
Primo! Primo! Primo!

41:34.535 --> 41:36.535
Yes!
