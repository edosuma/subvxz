- Hmm.

08:14.328 --> 08:16.330
No pressure.

08:17.915 --> 08:19.458
I'm on it.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.168
Jordan, you have

08:21.169 --> 08:22.753
a little bit of your

08:19.583 --> 08:22.753
nose on your cheek.

08:22.878 --> 08:23.878
(GIGGLING)

08:24.088 --> 08:27.216
Emma.

08:27.341 --> 08:28.718
I'm sorry, she's just really

08:28.719 --> 08:30.094
excited to see you.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.602
All right, Jessie,

08:38.604 --> 08:39.895
quit trying to steal

08:37.308 --> 08:39.895
Jordan from me!

08:40.020 --> 08:41.333
You're ruining

08:41.335 --> 08:42.647
my chance at happiness!

08:42.773 --> 08:43.982
You're 13!

08:43.984 --> 08:45.192
Your happiness

08:42.773 --> 08:45.192
should come from

08:47.050 --> 08:48.779

08:48.904 --> 08:50.090
- I love Jordan more
- than you do!

08:50.114 --> 08:51.449
Have you been in my room?

08:51.450 --> 08:52.783

Jordan poster pull-out

08:53.973 --> 08:55.035

08:55.160 --> 08:56.495
That's because I keep

08:56.496 --> 08:57.829
my Jordan shrine

08:55.160 --> 08:57.829
in the closet.

08:57.955 --> 08:58.955
Like a mature person.

09:00.958 --> 09:03.794
See?

09:03.919 --> 09:05.755
He might fall in love

09:05.756 --> 09:07.589
with me if you'd

09:03.919 --> 09:07.589
just back off!

09:07.714 --> 09:09.359
- Emma, I could back
- all the way to New Jersey.

09:09.383 --> 09:10.844
That will not change the fact

09:10.845 --> 09:12.303
that you're too young for him!

09:13.637 --> 09:15.157
- You wanna fight me
- for him, granny?

09:15.222 --> 09:16.307
Let's go!

09:17.766 --> 09:20.478
May the best woman win.

09:20.602 --> 09:22.722
- Suits me. - 'Cause I'm the only
- Woman in the room.

09:23.188 --> 09:24.940
Hey! Hey!

09:27.401 --> 09:28.986
Now you're the only

09:28.987 --> 09:30.570
woman in the closet!

09:30.695 --> 09:32.260
Emma, I'm gonna count

09:32.261 --> 09:33.824

09:30.695 --> 09:33.824

09:46.711 --> 09:48.610
There's nothing cool here.

09:48.611 --> 09:50.508
It's just clothes.

It's everyone from

10:10.133 --> 10:11.487

10:11.611 --> 10:13.009
We should probably

10:13.010 --> 10:14.406
put that back.

10:14.532 --> 10:15.115
- Right after we call
- every person on there.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.818
You're not leaving.

17:27.819 --> 17:30.216
You're going down with

17:25.420 --> 17:30.216
the rest of the family.

17:30.341 --> 17:31.781
We're here to help.

17:31.782 --> 17:33.219
If they want a piece

17:30.341 --> 17:33.219
of Jordan Taylor,

17:33.344 --> 17:35.179
- they can have
- his boring clothes!

17:35.305 --> 17:36.994
Don't throw his

17:36.995 --> 17:38.683
tighty-whities till you see

17:35.305 --> 17:38.683
the whites of their eyes!

17:38.809 --> 17:40.164
Jordan's not here,

17:40.165 --> 17:41.519
but you can have

17:38.809 --> 17:41.519
his clothes!

17:43.396 --> 17:44.606
And his ducky!

17:47.859 --> 17:49.653
It's working!

17:49.654 --> 17:51.446
The beast is feeding!

17:56.576 --> 17:58.453
- Isn't this nicer
- than a restaurant?

17:58.578 --> 17:59.913
It's so peaceful

17:59.914 --> 18:01.247
and private.

18:01.372 --> 18:03.625
(HELICOPTER APPROACHING)

18:03.750 --> 18:05.710
What's that?

18:05.836 --> 18:07.295
- I don't hear
- anything!

18:09.422 --> 18:10.862
It's the paparazzi!

18:10.863 --> 18:12.300
Coming for me!

18:13.217 --> 18:15.428
Not necessarily.

18:15.553 --> 18:16.909
There's a girl

18:16.910 --> 18:18.264
downstairs who looks

18:15.553 --> 18:18.264
just like Justin Bieber.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.430
- They're probably trying
- to get a picture of her.

18:26.690 --> 18:27.941
Okay, so it is you.

18:29.693 --> 18:30.694
(ALL SCREAMING)

18:36.616 --> 18:38.869
Ow!

18:38.994 --> 18:40.370
Sorry, Dad.

18:40.371 --> 18:41.746
She thought you were

18:38.994 --> 18:41.746
a crazed fan.

18:41.872 --> 18:43.748
- No, I didn't. - I just like
- Throwing stuff.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.168
What is going on?

18:47.293 --> 18:48.545
First, I have to fight

18:48.546 --> 18:49.796
my way through

18:47.293 --> 18:49.796
photographers,

18:49.921 --> 18:51.715
now these crazed fans.

18:51.716 --> 18:53.508
They stole my watch!

18:55.886 --> 18:56.886
And my left sock!

19:00.098 --> 19:01.350
Someone in your family

19:01.351 --> 19:02.600
ratted me out to the press.

19:03.518 --> 19:04.895
You all betrayed me!

19:05.020 --> 19:06.455
- Jordan, I'm sorry, - but let's not
- Overreact here.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.814
Yeah! It's not

19:07.815 --> 19:09.148
that bad.

19:09.273 --> 19:11.068
Jordan! Jordan!

19:11.192 --> 19:12.193
(ALL CLAMORING)

19:15.405 --> 19:17.574
So this bothers you?

19:20.284 --> 19:21.390
I knew I shouldn't

19:21.391 --> 19:22.495
have trusted you.

Hello? Prince William!

19:29.168 --> 19:31.129
- What? No! - Why would I call you
- A doody-head?

19:33.339 --> 19:34.799
That was weird.

19:34.925 --> 19:35.926
Jordan, I'm sorry...

19:35.927 --> 19:36.927
No, Morgan.

19:37.052 --> 19:38.302
- Okay, I'm
- out of here.

That's not gonna

19:42.413 --> 19:43.433
take long.

19:47.437 --> 19:48.897
All right, who told

19:48.898 --> 19:50.356
the world that Jordan

19:47.437 --> 19:50.356
was here?

19:54.111 --> 19:56.571
I did it.

19:56.696 --> 19:57.697
I was so excited

19:57.698 --> 19:58.698
about having a date

19:56.696 --> 19:58.698
with Jordan

19:58.823 --> 19:59.867
I couldn't resist texting

19:59.868 --> 20:00.909
Darla back home.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.595
- She must have put it
- on the Internet,

20:02.619 --> 20:03.808
Which apparently spreads

20:03.809 --> 20:04.996
private information.

20:06.998 --> 20:08.771
Jessie, I told

20:08.772 --> 20:10.543
everybody to keep

20:06.998 --> 20:10.543
it a secret!

20:10.668 --> 20:12.191
I know.

20:12.192 --> 20:13.713
And I'm really,

20:10.668 --> 20:13.713
really sorry.

20:13.838 --> 20:15.820
No, I'm sorry.

20:15.821 --> 20:17.801
I tipped off Leopard Beat

20:13.838 --> 20:17.801
to ruin Jessie's date

20:17.926 --> 20:18.926
with Jordan.

20:20.137 --> 20:21.846
- Jessie was lying
- to protect me.

20:21.972 --> 20:24.266
Actually, I wasn't lying.

20:24.267 --> 20:26.559
I really did tell Darla.

20:21.972 --> 20:26.559
Blabbermouth.

20:29.062 --> 20:30.147
And I may have

20:30.148 --> 20:31.230
posted something

20:31.355 --> 20:33.755
about hanging out

20:33.756 --> 20:36.153
with my "best bud" Jordan.

20:36.277 --> 20:38.196
And I told Millie the Mermaid,

20:38.197 --> 20:40.115
and she can't keep

20:36.277 --> 20:40.115
her mouth shut.

20:40.949 --> 20:43.264
I may have told

20:43.265 --> 20:45.578

all of you.

20:55.130 --> 20:56.923
- But not that
- disappointed,

21:12.357 --> 21:13.606
can't blame you.

- staying with me, too!
