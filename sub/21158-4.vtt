[Alba] <i>When I first got to the city,</i>
<i>I let my heart guide me.</i>

00:15.000 --> 00:16.720
<i>I was so innocent.</i>

00:17.760 --> 00:20.360
-Are you having fun?
-[chuckles]

00:20.440 --> 00:23.160
I've never been in such an elegant place.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.320
nor in such good company.

00:26.600 --> 00:29.320
[whispering] I must be
the envy of all these girls.

00:29.960 --> 00:32.600
Personally, I'd prefer
not to have to share your company

00:32.680 --> 00:34.000
with all these people.

00:36.320 --> 00:39.520
Would you excuse me?
I have to use the powder room.

00:40.480 --> 00:43.880
[Alba] <i>It wasn't long before I learned</i>
<i>that reality was much different.</i>

00:44.960 --> 00:47.080
And just what are you doing?

00:47.160 --> 00:50.000
You should find someone else
to do this work, Victoria.

00:50.080 --> 00:50.960
I can't do it.

00:51.040 --> 00:54.920
You'll never take control of your own life

00:55.480 --> 00:59.160
if you're still waiting
for Prince Charming to rescue you.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.720
Francisco isn't coming back.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.560
Why let your emotions get the best of you?

01:04.400 --> 01:06.120
[young Alba]
What if he tries kissing me again?

01:07.120 --> 01:08.200
That's easy.

01:10.160 --> 01:11.280
You dissuade him...

01:12.720 --> 01:13.720
with one of these.

01:13.800 --> 01:17.200
Just sneak one in his drink,
and he'll stop bothering you. Mm?

01:17.880 --> 01:20.200
[crowd] Five, four...

01:20.280 --> 01:23.000

02:04.680 --> 02:07.680
[Carlos] Miss Aguilar.
What a coincidence seeing you here.

02:08.720 --> 02:10.199
Would you care for a drink?

02:11.320 --> 02:12.680
Just one drink.

02:13.280 --> 02:15.680
-What do you say?
-[chuckles]

02:17.880 --> 02:19.280
Is that a yes?

02:20.080 --> 02:23.360
-Miss Aguilar, is that a yes?
-Why don't you call me Lidia?

02:26.120 --> 02:27.840
[Alba] <i>Then there are those who believe</i>

02:27.920 --> 02:30.360

02:30.440 --> 02:33.480

-[Carlos] Where were we?
-[Alba] <i>But it's a lie.</i>

02:36.080 --> 02:38.000
We were about to make a toast.

-A good start to a great night.
-Mm-hmm.

I-- I'm sorry.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.960

08:19.800 --> 08:21.600
It's important. Open the door!

08:22.400 --> 08:23.800
He's in there, but he won't answer.

08:23.880 --> 08:26.000
[man] This happens a lot with Don Carlos.

08:29.880 --> 08:32.840
-I'll be downstairs if you need me.
-[Francisco] Thank you.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.280
Carlos.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.040
-Hey, wake up.
-[grunts softly]

08:46.120 --> 08:48.680
[Carlos] Stop, stop... That's enough!

08:48.760 --> 08:50.000
[Francisco] Are you okay?

08:50.920 --> 08:53.680
-[Carlos] Where's the girl?
-There was no one here when I arrived.

08:53.760 --> 08:54.960
[sighs]

08:56.480 --> 08:58.080
What are you doing here?

08:58.160 --> 08:59.360
It's your sister.

09:00.640 --> 09:01.720
She tried to kill herself.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.800
What? How is she? Is she all right?

09:04.880 --> 09:07.200
[Francisco] I don't know.
It's my fault, Carlos.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.440
[Carlos] How can that be?

09:08.520 --> 09:10.880
[Francisco] There are things
I didn't tell you about Alba.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.480
She didn't just come back into my life...

09:13.560 --> 09:16.560
-[footsteps approaching]
-[Carlos] Lidia!

09:17.880 --> 09:21.200
Oh! I didn't mean to interrupt.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.680
I'm sorry, but there's a family emergency.

09:23.760 --> 09:25.920
Then I should probably be going.

09:27.320 --> 09:29.760
-Goodbye.
-[Carlos] Bye.

09:31.680 --> 09:33.280
Francisco, come on.

09:34.080 --> 09:36.160
You and the operator.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.400
We'll talk about it later.
What matters now is Elisa.

09:41.160 --> 09:44.680
And you had to come out to keep Francisco
from telling him the truth?

09:44.760 --> 09:46.160
What else could I do?

09:46.240 --> 09:48.640
The blueprints were there, within reach.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.040
-I couldn't take them.
-[laughing]

09:51.960 --> 09:53.640
Why are you laughing? What's so funny?

09:53.720 --> 09:55.880
I'd have liked to have seen
the look on Francisco's face

09:55.960 --> 09:59.440
when he found his best friend
with his first love. [chuckles]

09:59.520 --> 10:01.200
I'm sure you can imagine it.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.680
Look on the bright side.

10:04.760 --> 10:08.280
One positive thing
came out of your failed robbery.

10:08.360 --> 10:09.360
What?

10:10.280 --> 10:14.480
Didn't you want to push Francisco away?
There was no better way to do it.

10:14.560 --> 10:17.960
No, I just didn't want his life
to be in danger.

10:18.960 --> 10:20.160
I didn't want to hurt him.

10:20.240 --> 10:23.680
Darling, you can't have everything.
I already told you--

10:23.760 --> 10:26.720
Victoria, if you're going to say
you warned me, please...

10:26.800 --> 10:30.320
I won't say another word. You're an adult.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.760
I gave you advice.
If you take it, perfect.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.760
If you don't, well...

10:34.840 --> 10:37.080
you're the one
who'll suffer the consequences.

10:38.640 --> 10:42.480
I guess now
you'll have to keep pretending

10:42.560 --> 10:46.000
that you're attracted to that man
until you get the blueprints.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.240
Because I guess you're willing
to make sacrifices for Francisco

10:51.320 --> 10:58.000
to keep people from finding out
about your mistake, that kiss. Hmm?

10:59.640 --> 11:00.480
Alba?

11:01.120 --> 11:02.120
I am.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.560
Of course I am.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.440
He's taking a long time.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.880
I'm glad to see that, after all,

11:11.960 --> 11:14.560
you're not totally indifferent
to what happens in this family.

11:14.640 --> 11:16.160
[Carmen] Ricardo, please...

11:16.240 --> 11:20.560
All that matters is that Elisa recovers
and that word of this doesn't get out.

11:22.160 --> 11:25.880
Fortunately for us, you show up to worry
once the worst is already over.

11:25.960 --> 11:27.280
It's a relief.

11:27.640 --> 11:31.560
-I said I was sorry, Father.
-What good is being sorry?

11:31.640 --> 11:34.160
Have you asked yourself
what we'd be doing now

11:34.240 --> 11:36.360
if Francisco hadn't been here?

11:36.440 --> 11:39.560
-[Francisco] It isn't Carlos' fault.
-It's not just about this.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.560
Why not say what you're thinking?

11:42.080 --> 11:45.480
How could I have been so mistaken
when it came to your upbringing?

11:46.200 --> 11:50.520
When did you become a good-for-nothing
who only thinks about women and parties?

11:50.600 --> 11:52.200
I'm not a good-for-nothing.

11:52.280 --> 11:56.000
You're irresponsible and selfish.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.920
All you think about
is wasting the family fortune.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.240
-I can't trust you with the company.
-Do you know why I'm never here?

12:03.600 --> 12:07.280
If I had to put up with you day and night,
I'd have been the one who slit my wrists,

12:07.360 --> 12:08.360
not Elisa.

12:08.440 --> 12:09.560
Ricardo...

12:10.800 --> 12:12.240
that's enough.

12:12.320 --> 12:14.400
That isn't even half of what he deserves.

12:14.480 --> 12:15.680
[door opens]

12:17.080 --> 12:18.480
How is she, doctor?

12:19.080 --> 12:21.680
She has to rest. She's awake now.

12:21.760 --> 12:25.560
Doña Carmen, your daughter has asked
to see her husband first.

12:28.600 --> 12:29.800
[sighs]

13:00.360 --> 13:01.560
Darling...

13:03.080 --> 13:04.480
how are you?

13:06.880 --> 13:08.360
Do you still love her?

13:10.280 --> 13:11.720
That's all in the past.

13:12.560 --> 13:15.800
I really need to believe you,
because I can't...

13:15.880 --> 13:18.760
I can't bear the idea of you thinking
about another woman.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.000
-Elisa...
-[sniffles]

13:20.080 --> 13:22.600
Elisa, you're the only woman I care about.

13:23.520 --> 13:24.680
The only one.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.800
Then get rid of that suitcase...

13:28.960 --> 13:31.800
and swear that you've ended
that relationship.

13:33.080 --> 13:37.040
Because if I lose you,
next time I won't let you save me.

13:39.920 --> 13:43.400
And everyone will know you're responsible
for my death.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.160

15:18.200 --> 15:20.360
[Lola] Girls, breakfast is ready.

15:20.440 --> 15:21.960
[Marga] Yes, we're coming, Doña Lola.

15:22.520 --> 15:24.960
[Lola] It's always the same.
You'll be late!

15:33.000 --> 15:34.440
[Mario] Ángeles!

15:34.520 --> 15:37.840
Honey, how am I supposed to go
to work wearing this?

15:37.920 --> 15:39.520
This shirt hasn't been ironed.

15:41.080 --> 15:44.520
What's going on this morning?
Breakfast isn't ready. I'm hungry. Hey?

15:44.600 --> 15:45.640
I'm talking to you!

15:46.000 --> 15:48.160
The iron is in the closet.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.440
You can iron it yourself.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.560
Come on, iron the shirt.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.640
-What?
-Iron the shirt.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.920
You don't need me for other things.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.680
[sighs] Do we have to talk
about this again?

16:05.760 --> 16:07.080
Are you really serious?

16:08.800 --> 16:11.760
Ángeles, I told you already. I'm sorry.

16:11.840 --> 16:15.200
It was one mistake, Ángeles. One.

16:15.280 --> 16:18.200
What else do I have to do?
Will you ever forgive me?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.600
Honestly, I'm not sure.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.840
But, until I decide,

16:25.920 --> 16:28.840
you'll do your own laundry
and make your own breakfast.

16:37.520 --> 16:40.840
-Did he ask you out?
-Well, not exactly.

16:40.920 --> 16:43.760
He said we'd meet in the bar
to have lunch and talk.

16:43.840 --> 16:46.600
So he asked you out.
You said yes, didn't you?

16:47.160 --> 16:48.400
Marga!

16:48.480 --> 16:52.280
If I go to the bar, I'll have to admit
I was lying to him. I can't do that.

16:52.360 --> 16:54.760
Just explain and apologize.
He'll understand.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.160
And what if he doesn't?

16:57.360 --> 16:59.200
No, it's best if I don't go.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.760
Yes, it is.
I mean, why take a risk and live life?

17:01.840 --> 17:04.880
You can stay at the boardinghouse
with Doña Lola and feel bitter.

17:04.960 --> 17:08.000
-Carlota, I'm not bitter.
-No, but you're a coward.

17:09.280 --> 17:10.720
Is this insult day?

17:10.800 --> 17:14.240
If you lose him because you won't take
a risk, don't come crying to us.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.319
Stay away from my wife, got that?

17:17.400 --> 17:20.480
-You're not allowed in here.
-I don't want you talking to her.

17:20.560 --> 17:24.200
I don't know what you've said to her,
but she was never this disobedient.

17:24.280 --> 17:25.960
-Disobedient?
-Be quiet!

17:26.040 --> 17:29.360
-You're not to talk to her again.
-[Ángeles] All right, please.

17:29.440 --> 17:30.440
Mario, get out.

17:35.720 --> 17:37.040
I'm sorry.

17:37.120 --> 17:39.800
Why are you apologizing? It's his fault!

17:39.880 --> 17:42.760
-Ángeles, Ángeles...
-[breathing heavily]

17:42.840 --> 17:43.960
Come on, sit down.

17:44.040 --> 17:46.880
Why do things always happen
at the worst time?

17:46.960 --> 17:48.120
Sit down.

17:49.160 --> 17:50.440
What's going on?

17:51.720 --> 17:53.040
I'm pregnant.

17:54.280 --> 17:59.000
I told him it was a lie, but it's true,
and now I don't know what to do.

17:59.080 --> 18:00.360
Stay calm.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.160
We have to start working. I'm fine.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.280
-Ángeles, wait.
-Okay.

18:06.360 --> 18:07.520
[Alba] Listen...

18:10.240 --> 18:11.560
Listen.

18:11.640 --> 18:14.960
If you want to fix the problem,
I know someone who can help.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.080
She's trustworthy and very discreet.

18:17.160 --> 18:18.280
No.

18:19.600 --> 18:20.600
No.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.960
For me, a child is a blessing.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.160
[Alba] Yes, but at times it isn't.

18:28.400 --> 18:31.400
You're not the first friend of mine
who's been in this situation.

18:36.160 --> 18:38.920
Thank you, but... [sniffles]

18:39.000 --> 18:42.200
no, I can cope with this.

18:49.400 --> 18:52.920
[clears throat] My dear, you have a call.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.880
Do you think
you're well enough to take it?

18:55.960 --> 18:58.760
Yes, Mother, don't worry. Thank you.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.760
[phone ringing]

19:09.880 --> 19:11.640
-Hello.
-[Carolina] <i>Doña Elisa?</i>

19:11.720 --> 19:14.880
-This is Carolina.
<i>-Yes? What is it?</i>

19:14.960 --> 19:17.680
I've moved into the boardinghouse
where that operator Lidia--

19:17.760 --> 19:19.080
<i>Forget about Lidia.</i>

19:19.160 --> 19:21.160
I found a note my husband wrote
to his mistress.

19:21.240 --> 19:23.000
Her name is Alba, not Lidia.

19:23.080 --> 19:24.880
<i>You have the wrong woman.</i>

19:24.960 --> 19:26.920
Alba? Are you sure about that?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.640
I saw the note with my own eyes.

19:29.720 --> 19:32.640
<i>-Yes, of course. I didn't mean to...</i>
-Find this Alba.

19:33.280 --> 19:34.560
[line disconnects]

19:39.200 --> 19:41.480
Alba... Let's see if there's an Alba...

19:46.000 --> 19:47.760
-Don Francisco.
-Yes?

19:48.680 --> 19:52.320
Would you like me to organize
the celebration for the employees?

19:52.400 --> 19:54.520
We've reached 150,000 subscribers
in all of Spain.

19:54.600 --> 19:56.240
There will be no party.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.800
Remember, it was my father
who made that rule.

19:58.880 --> 20:01.480
We celebrate every 50,000 new subscribers.

20:01.560 --> 20:03.920
-Good morning, Carolina.
-Good morning, Don Carlos.

20:05.240 --> 20:08.600
Carlos, your father will be angry.

20:08.680 --> 20:10.160
I'm doing what he expects me to do,

20:10.240 --> 20:12.760
organizing parties
and wasting the family fortune.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.760
It's like you're doing it on purpose.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.200
I hope it's not because
we rejected the prototype.

20:17.280 --> 20:20.920
If I were resentful,
I'd have stopped speaking to him long ago.

20:22.320 --> 20:23.680
The party starts at 6:00.

20:23.760 --> 20:26.200
This isn't a good day for celebrations.

20:26.280 --> 20:27.720
Francisco, sit down.

20:32.720 --> 20:35.400
No one must know about
what happened with Elisa, right?

20:36.320 --> 20:38.240
One thing my father hates more
than parties

20:38.320 --> 20:39.600
is not keeping up appearances.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.280
We have to carry on.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.360
We have to pretend things are normal.

20:44.440 --> 20:46.840
Leave it to me. It's my way of helping.

20:47.760 --> 20:49.440
You all say I'm good at it.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.880
It's a complicated situation,
but things will return to normal.

20:54.960 --> 20:57.640
Nothing will go back to normal,
and it's my fault.

20:57.720 --> 21:00.680
-You don't choose who you love.
-But you decide who you stay with.

21:02.600 --> 21:03.880
I made a mistake...

21:04.680 --> 21:07.920
and I almost gave up everything
for someone who wasn't worth it.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.800
-You mean Alba?
-Yes, yes.

21:12.880 --> 21:16.080
She isn't the person I thought she was.
Not anymore.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.400
I never thought I'd hear you say that.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.600
There are many things we don't expect.

21:28.240 --> 21:31.400
I want one tray of hors d'oeuvres
and one of drinks on each table.

21:31.480 --> 21:32.560
Don't put it all together.

21:32.640 --> 21:36.600
Otherwise, the guys from administration
will dig in, and we know how that'll end.

21:36.680 --> 21:38.480
Somewhere around here.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.440
So it's true about the party.

21:40.880 --> 21:44.880
Very well, that's all.
I want everything ready before 6:00.

21:44.960 --> 21:46.160
Get going!

21:48.200 --> 21:50.520
So you still want to party
after your problem at home.

21:50.600 --> 21:51.840
She'll get over it.

21:51.920 --> 21:55.240
Ángeles is a very bright woman,
and she knows that men like me

21:55.320 --> 21:56.840
are unfaithful by nature.

21:56.920 --> 21:58.800
She certainly deserves her place
in heaven.

21:59.440 --> 22:00.720
Who cares about heaven, blue eyes?

22:00.800 --> 22:02.560
-They're green.
-Well, they're beautiful.

22:04.160 --> 22:07.080
Did I tell you my favorite sin? I will.

22:09.760 --> 22:10.840
[sighs]

22:11.800 --> 22:16.520
Pablo, Pablo.
Women... Trouble on two legs.

22:16.600 --> 22:19.160
Don Mario, women are like mathematics.

22:19.240 --> 22:20.520
Hard for men to understand,

22:20.600 --> 22:22.600
but it's impossible to explain life
without them.

22:22.680 --> 22:24.200
[laughs]

22:24.280 --> 22:25.840
You reek of cologne. Going to a wedding?

22:25.920 --> 22:29.040
-No, no.
-Have you got a date?

22:32.600 --> 22:34.200
You're meeting up with the operator.

22:34.280 --> 22:36.560
[shushes] We're just having lunch.

22:36.640 --> 22:38.200
-It isn't a date.
-It's a date.

22:38.280 --> 22:41.920
No, we're colleagues. We get along well.
We're just having lunch.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.200
It's a date.

22:44.480 --> 22:49.400
I'll do you a favor. Take her here.
They don't ask questions, and it's clean.

22:49.480 --> 22:50.920
You owe me one!

22:51.600 --> 22:53.960
MONTERA
BOARDINGHOUSE

23:03.280 --> 23:05.680
Lidia, Don Francisco wants to see you
in his office.

23:09.040 --> 23:11.080
Carlota, could I have a word with you?

23:15.000 --> 23:19.400
I need you to spy on these numbers.
Orders from the government delegate.

23:19.480 --> 23:22.000
-And the transcriptions--
-I'll get them to you.

23:23.440 --> 23:26.600
Is everything all right?
If you want to talk about--

23:26.680 --> 23:29.280
No, there's no need to.
I should get back to work.

23:37.400 --> 23:38.560
[Francisco] Come in.

23:50.400 --> 23:51.640
What are you up to?

23:52.320 --> 23:54.840
I don't have to explain
who I associate with to you.

23:54.920 --> 23:57.600
-It's none of your business.
-It is my business!

23:58.800 --> 24:02.320
I catch you breaking into the safe,
then almost in bed with him.

24:04.280 --> 24:07.240
-I've been honest with you, and you--
-What about me?

24:08.440 --> 24:11.920
Why are you doing this?
Do you want to drive me crazy?

24:19.160 --> 24:20.320
Do you know...

24:22.360 --> 24:24.240
Do you know how hard this is for me?

24:25.040 --> 24:27.880
You don't, do you? You have no idea.

24:32.040 --> 24:33.360
[softly] I'm sorry.

24:35.560 --> 24:38.200
I didn't want to hurt you.
I just wanted to get on with my life.

24:38.280 --> 24:41.880
Do you have to choose my best friend,
my brother-in-law?

24:41.960 --> 24:44.360
I don't believe it! I don't!

24:45.400 --> 24:48.680
I was about to destroy my life
and my wife's life for nothing!

24:51.040 --> 24:52.080
Alba...

24:53.320 --> 24:55.040
tell me it wasn't for nothing.

24:57.040 --> 24:59.520
I didn't ask you
to give up anything for me.

25:14.760 --> 25:16.000
[suitcase slams]

25:16.080 --> 25:17.800
I suppose you'll remember this.

25:27.880 --> 25:29.680
You're still living in the past.

25:30.640 --> 25:32.000
I don't believe you.

25:34.960 --> 25:37.440
Show me that you really feel nothing
for me.

25:52.840 --> 25:53.960
Nothing.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.040
Nothing.

I was about to do it,
but when I saw him, my legs froze.

28:35.480 --> 28:38.720
I know what you're going to say.
That I'm a coward and I'm bitter.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.880
I'm not as strong and brave as you are.

28:40.960 --> 28:43.760
Can I help it if I'm scared?
You're not afraid of anything.

28:46.720 --> 28:49.520

I won't say that again.

-No, I'd prefer to keep working.

[bell ringing]

29:19.400 --> 29:20.600
Good evening, everyone.

29:22.040 --> 29:26.720
A few days ago, the Telephone Company made
the first transatlantic call.

29:27.520 --> 29:30.760
Today, we're here for something
perhaps less remarkable,

29:30.840 --> 29:32.120
but no less important.

29:32.200 --> 29:36.440
Thanks to everyone's hard work,
we now have reached 150,000 subscribers!

29:36.520 --> 29:38.680
[crowd cheering]

29:40.920 --> 29:45.360
And that is due in part
to your effort and your dedication.

29:46.600 --> 29:50.400
That is why management
is throwing you this little party,

29:50.480 --> 29:53.360
as is the custom
when we reach subscriber milestones.

29:53.440 --> 29:57.920
Enjoy the evening, and I hope
we'll soon reach 200,000. Cheers!

29:58.000 --> 29:59.280

30:11.920 --> 30:16.120
A nice speech
and an even nicer gesture for the workers.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.400
Some workers deserve everything.

I was dying to see you after last night.

30:20.560 --> 30:23.320
[chuckles] You fell asleep.
I thought I had bored you.

30:23.400 --> 30:27.280
No, you could never do that.
I think it was the wine, the champagne.

30:27.360 --> 30:30.440
It was rude of me,
and I'd like to make it up to you

30:30.520 --> 30:32.840

I had thought that, as well as being
a magnificent host, you had big dreams.

30:42.160 --> 30:44.280
-Is this your dream?
-Planning parties?

30:44.360 --> 30:47.200
-No, of course not.
-I meant the subscribers.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.640

But my dreams go much farther.

not just the number of subscribers.

I'm not here to argue.

31:35.320 --> 31:36.720

31:38.160 --> 31:39.720
I'm not very proud of what I've done.

31:40.720 --> 31:45.120
And if I'm sorry about it for anyone,
it's you, because I appreciate you--

31:45.200 --> 31:49.520
You appreciate me?
Now you've gone too far.

31:49.600 --> 31:52.320

is lecturing me about morality.

-I don't care what you're doing.

31:55.120 --> 31:57.600
-You're not stealing my husband.

He's sorry and he won't do it again.

32:00.800 --> 32:01.800
"Sorry"?

32:01.880 --> 32:04.800

he knows the meaning of that word?

32:04.880 --> 32:05.880

-You're not going anywhere.

What is this? Are these things
that your friends say to you?

45:04.640 --> 45:06.720
-You are not like them.
-Leave them alone.

45:06.800 --> 45:08.000

45:14.240 --> 45:16.240
-Do you want to know why?
-Yes!

45:17.160 --> 45:20.640
Because you cheated on me!
Not just once, but so many times!

45:22.040 --> 45:25.240

you let me buy you a drink. Why?

I'd say someone broke your heart.
