- Where are you gardening guys?

00:52.552 --> 00:53.955
Oh, I think I'm getting warm.

00:53.988 --> 00:56.790
I think I'm getting very warm.

00:57.791 --> 00:58.591
What's that?

01:01.594 --> 01:02.997
What the hell's that doing here?

01:04.597 --> 01:06.499
That's a nice
Christmas decoration.

01:08.768 --> 01:12.173
Christmas balls, tiny balls,

01:12.206 --> 01:14.474
medium balls, going
up to big balls.

01:15.675 --> 01:18.279
I don't know where
the hell they are.

01:18.312 --> 01:21.916
So can you tell me where
the gardening hats are?

01:21.949 --> 01:24.185
- Aisle number five, towards
the end on the right.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.287
- Hey.
- This belongs to the store.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.055
You can't buy this,

01:28.089 --> 01:30.690
but we can find you
something like this, but-

01:30.724 --> 01:32.259
- I mean, that's one of a kind.

01:33.626 --> 01:35.162
Wait a second. Wait
a second, wait a sec.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.701
I think you blocked up all
these things because you don't

01:41.735 --> 01:44.972
want the customers to
go over all through it,

01:45.006 --> 01:48.742
because you wanna limit what
we do because it's so late.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.677
You don't wanna have
to deal with us going

01:50.710 --> 01:51.946
all over the place.

01:51.979 --> 01:53.314
Here's, here's, I'm
making a point, okay?

01:53.347 --> 01:55.082
- If you reverse, go that way,

01:55.116 --> 01:58.219
you'll get to aisle number
five a little bit faster.

02:00.754 --> 02:01.588
- Which way?

02:02.756 --> 02:05.625
Woo, ooh.

02:06.693 --> 02:08.661
Supervisor Dan.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.597
Supervisor Dan.

02:10.630 --> 02:11.598
Guess what?

02:11.631 --> 02:16.636
You have very, very nice
holiday elevator music.

02:16.669 --> 02:21.308
Oh Danny boy, I'm right
here at the cash register.

02:21.342 --> 02:22.143
Oh, here you are.

02:22.176 --> 02:23.010
How you doing?

02:23.911 --> 02:24.744
- I'm sorry.

02:27.847 --> 02:29.616
- Why are you looking
at me like that?

02:29.649 --> 02:31.152
What are you so
angry at me about?

02:31.185 --> 02:32.319
So, I had a few drinks.

02:32.353 --> 02:33.753
This place is huge.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.889
Nobody knows what the
fuck they're looking for

02:35.923 --> 02:37.590
after a while.
- Thank you.

02:38.392 --> 02:39.960
Have a nice day.

02:39.994 --> 02:41.195
- Can we go now, please?

02:42.729 --> 02:43.964
- I'll tell you one thing.

02:43.998 --> 02:45.933
You don't like me,
but I like you.

02:46.901 --> 02:47.700
- Thank you.

02:47.734 --> 02:48.735
- You're welcome.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.737
- Have a good night.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.641
Is this what you need in
the middle of the night?

02:54.674 --> 02:56.944
You know you could have asked
for these for Christmas.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.778
- And you would've
gotten wrong ones.

03:02.083 --> 03:04.251
You're walking too fast.

03:39.053 --> 03:39.886
Ah.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.624
- Here, careful. It's kinda hot.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.062
- Where are you going, Sammy?

03:48.095 --> 03:49.696
You should watch the
news. It's good for you.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.433
Be aware of what's
going on in the world.

03:52.466 --> 03:53.867
- It's so depressing.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.370
- Yeah. That's the world, Sammy.

03:56.403 --> 03:59.340
That's the world
we live in. Jesus.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.008
- Mass shooting.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.376
- Shit, another commercial.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.411
Oh, good.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.745
- Here.

04:05.778 --> 04:06.846
Remember to take these, okay?

04:06.880 --> 04:09.283
- Sh, sh, sh. It's her.

04:11.152 --> 04:12.453
- Judge Judy?

04:12.486 --> 04:14.221
- She's a beautiful woman.

04:14.255 --> 04:16.190
Bring it together.

04:16.223 --> 04:17.992
In January of this year,

04:18.025 --> 04:19.826
he was supposed to
be your boyfriend.

04:19.859 --> 04:21.694
- What are we doing
here anyway, man?

04:21.728 --> 04:24.465
Deciding which is perfect
and which is imperfect.

04:24.498 --> 04:28.969
Look, this one's a little off
in its shape, so it's what?

04:29.003 --> 04:31.305
It's imperfect? Come on.

04:31.338 --> 04:32.173
This shit.

04:33.374 --> 04:36.776
This shit tastes as
good or better than

04:36.809 --> 04:37.744
this perfect one.

04:37.777 --> 04:38.612
- Chill, man.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.780
- No, that's what
I'm saying though.

04:40.813 --> 04:42.917
It's all gonna be
fully automated soon,

04:42.950 --> 04:43.850
so it doesn't matter.

04:43.883 --> 04:45.319
You hear what I'm saying?

04:45.352 --> 04:47.787
- Gentlemen, I think you'll
find this very effective

04:47.820 --> 04:49.223
and efficient system-

04:49.256 --> 04:50.757
Samuel, hair, tuck it.

05:46.380 --> 05:47.514
- Hello.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.116
Let me know if you need
help with anything.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.850
- Sure. Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.410
Thank you, come again.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.014
Ooh, Pisces?

06:21.582 --> 06:24.118
- That's funny.
- What?

06:24.151 --> 06:25.818
- To be honest with you,

06:25.852 --> 06:28.589
I'm really uncool and I was
trying to figure out like

06:28.622 --> 06:30.257
how to talk to you,

06:30.291 --> 06:32.559
and then you hit me with
the oldest line in the book.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.495
- So...
- What's that?

06:34.528 --> 06:35.629
- Like, what's your sign?

06:35.663 --> 06:38.831
- Oh, well, this is kind of
like our horoscope section.

06:38.865 --> 06:41.868
Yeah. We picked books for
each astrological sign.

06:43.137 --> 06:44.171
- Right. Yeah.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.406
I'm in, I'm in the-
- Yeah.

06:45.439 --> 06:46.340
- I don't know if
I really believe

06:46.373 --> 06:48.042
in the whole astrology thing.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.376
I, I know that I,

06:49.410 --> 06:51.178
I want to believe
in stuff like that,

06:51.211 --> 06:53.914
but then there's this
like, inner cynic inside,

06:55.616 --> 06:56.450
inside me.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.899
- Ooh. Nice.

07:12.933 --> 07:13.567
- Thanks.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.570
- So it's $125 plus tax.

07:16.603 --> 07:17.938
Do you think that'll
be cash or credit?

07:17.971 --> 07:19.506
- Ooh.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.608
One...a hundred and twenty five?

07:21.642 --> 07:25.346
- Yeah.
- Um, uh...

07:25.379 --> 07:26.513
- We have, I mean,

07:26.547 --> 07:29.650
we have a lot of cool books
we just put out over by Mary.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.618
There's like some sales stuff.

07:31.652 --> 07:34.154
- I didn't even see all
those books over there.

07:34.188 --> 07:35.222
I'm gonna-

07:35.255 --> 07:36.056
Will you hold onto that?

07:36.090 --> 07:36.957
I'm just gonna check
everything out.

07:36.990 --> 07:37.958
- Okay.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.460
- Oh yeah,

07:39.493 --> 07:41.929
You got, you got a whole
bunch of stuff over here.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.497
The, I see what you do.

07:43.530 --> 07:47.501
You, you hide the, the
discount from the customer.

07:47.534 --> 07:48.502
- Yeah. You figured us out.

07:48.535 --> 07:49.403
- Very sneaky.

07:50.537 --> 07:51.538
Oh, perfect.

07:53.107 --> 07:54.541
- You into gardening?

07:54.575 --> 07:55.909
- It's a, it's a gift.

07:55.943 --> 07:58.011
Thanks a lot.
- Yeah. No problem.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.012
- Find one?

07:59.046 --> 07:59.980
- Yeah, this is great.

08:00.013 --> 08:00.814
- Perfect.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.483
So both of these
or just this one?

08:02.516 --> 08:06.687
- Mm, can you, can you maybe
hold, hold that one for me and,

08:06.720 --> 08:09.423
and I'm gonna take
that one now and think,

08:09.456 --> 08:10.491
think about that one?

08:10.524 --> 08:11.925
- With tax it's $5.40.

08:11.959 --> 08:12.593
- Great.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.230
Perfect. Keep the change.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.698
- Oh, thank you.

08:17.731 --> 08:18.932
Would you like a bag?

08:18.966 --> 08:19.767
- No, no.

08:19.800 --> 08:20.701
I'll do my part for
the environment.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.136
- Okay.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.937
- But I was wondering
if I could call you,

08:23.971 --> 08:25.072
we could hang out or-

08:26.440 --> 08:28.041
- I'm not really
dating right now.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.243
- That's perfect.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.477
'Cause I'm not dating
anybody right now.

08:30.511 --> 08:33.080
We're just two single people.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.915
- I'm just not dating right now.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.284
- Okay.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.653
Hey, thanks again.

08:39.686 --> 08:40.554
- Merry Christmas.

08:40.587 --> 08:41.422
- You too.

08:50.197 --> 08:53.634
- Why do red lights mean stop
and green lights mean go?

08:53.667 --> 08:56.036
And yellow, don't do anything.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.071
- Yellow means like, chill out.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.741
- Yeah, everything
started with something.

09:00.774 --> 09:04.011
For some reason we decided
that be red was stop.

09:04.044 --> 09:04.945
Hey!

09:04.978 --> 09:07.014
Hey, where'd you learn
to drive you jerk?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.148
- Are you nuts?

09:08.182 --> 09:08.982
Are you dumb?
- Idiot!

09:09.016 --> 09:10.050
- Bill.
- What?

09:10.818 --> 09:12.719
- You can't get out of
a moving vehicle, okay?

09:12.753 --> 09:14.021
- Asshole.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.088
- I'm an asshole?

09:15.122 --> 09:16.423
- No, no. That driver.

09:16.457 --> 09:17.357
You're not an asshole.

09:17.391 --> 09:20.227
You're just a type of schmuck.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.161
- I'm a what?

09:21.195 --> 09:22.329
- You're a schmucky driver.

09:22.362 --> 09:23.163
- I'm a schmucky driver?

09:23.197 --> 09:23.997
- Yes.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.499
- Okay, Bill.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.301
I literally just stopped this
from getting in an accident.

09:27.334 --> 09:28.735
So.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.037
- Let me drive, okay?

09:31.538 --> 09:33.440
Pull over and let me drive.

09:33.474 --> 09:35.409
- Oh man. You know, I would,
but we're almost there.

09:35.442 --> 09:36.243
So...

09:36.276 --> 09:37.110
- Rich.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.114
- Are you low blood
sugar or something?

09:41.148 --> 09:43.350
You know, you're not really
in the Christmas spirit.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.052
- Oh, and look at this.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.087
Those assholes are going
to the same church.

09:48.689 --> 09:49.790
Jesus.

09:49.823 --> 09:52.759
And they're taking our spot.
That's our favorite spot.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.178
- Thank you.

10:45.212 --> 10:46.813
Wasn't that beautiful?

10:48.115 --> 10:51.118
He gave so that we could live.

10:52.553 --> 10:57.090
So when you wake up on that
morning, take a moment.

10:57.124 --> 10:59.860
Take a moment to say
thank you to Him.

10:59.893 --> 11:02.095
Maybe wish Him a happy
birthday as well.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.833
And I know for some of you
this is a painful time of year.

11:06.867 --> 11:10.437
Some of you have lost your
jobs and you're uncertain

11:10.470 --> 11:12.573
how you're going to manage
to make this holiday

11:12.606 --> 11:14.174
special for your children.

11:15.142 --> 11:18.845
Some of you have lost loved
ones and their absence

11:18.879 --> 11:22.583
during this time is
especially heartfelt

11:22.616 --> 11:24.418
because it's a time
of celebration.

11:25.652 --> 11:29.189
But you can take solace in the
fact that they are in heaven

11:29.222 --> 11:32.225
with their loving father.
- Pay attention.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.160
- Are you serious right now?

11:33.193 --> 11:34.795
- Sorry about that.
- And they are smiling

11:34.828 --> 11:38.565
down upon you and whispering
the words, "It is well.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.136
It is well."

11:43.170 --> 11:45.472
♪ It is well ♪

11:47.507 --> 11:49.209
- That's the car.

11:49.242 --> 11:53.880
- No, what are you, no,
please don't do something.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.351
- Were you the car that-
- Bill.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.285
Hello.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.253
You may not remember,

12:00.287 --> 12:02.522
but we met briefly years ago

12:02.556 --> 12:04.358
when I was singing in the choir.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.826
- Oh, oh.

12:05.859 --> 12:09.396
I believe I do remember
seeing you singing up there.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.464
How do you do?

12:10.497 --> 12:11.898
- Tina.
- Tina.

12:11.933 --> 12:13.935
- Tina. And this is,
this is my daughter Kate.

12:13.968 --> 12:16.370
- Oh, well this is my son, Sam.

12:18.940 --> 12:20.807
- Nice to meet you, Sam.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.809
- Nice to, nice to
meet you too, Kate.

12:22.843 --> 12:25.278
- So, what seems
to be the problem?

12:25.312 --> 12:27.714
- This is not turning over.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.282
- Oh, let's see.

12:30.517 --> 12:31.618
Maybe the battery.

12:31.652 --> 12:34.254
- Oh, I'll go get jumper cables.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.589
- That would be
great. Thank you.

12:35.622 --> 12:38.291
- Tina, could you just
give it a little gas?

12:38.325 --> 12:39.593
Just a little?

12:42.462 --> 12:45.232
No, it's not the battery.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.167
Okay. It's not the-

12:47.935 --> 12:50.203
No, that doesn't
work unless you-

12:50.237 --> 12:51.505
- Jumper cables.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.573
- You gotta attach it to
our car for it to work.

12:53.607 --> 12:54.608
- Mom, that's not
doing anything.

12:54.641 --> 12:56.209
- It's alright.

12:56.243 --> 12:57.544
- Mom, stop, mom, mom, stop!

12:57.577 --> 12:58.879
- What, what?
- It's okay, it's okay.

12:58.913 --> 12:59.981
- What?
- We're fine.

13:00.014 --> 13:00.881
- I just need to call a cab.

13:00.915 --> 13:02.282
- No, no, no, no, no.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.518
We'd be glad to give
you a ride home.

13:04.551 --> 13:05.652
Sam, get the car.
- Really?

13:05.686 --> 13:07.320
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Get the car.

13:07.354 --> 13:08.455
No no no, I insist.
- You don't need to do that.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.690
We can just take a cab.

13:09.723 --> 13:12.526
- It is our pleasure to
take you wherever you

13:12.559 --> 13:13.995
and your daughter
would like to go.

13:14.028 --> 13:16.663
- Okay well, I'm just gonna
get my things together.

13:16.697 --> 13:17.698
- Okay, Sam?

13:19.332 --> 13:20.001
Yeah, go ahead.

13:20.034 --> 13:21.368
Do you need help?
- No no.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.602
- Okay, Sam?

13:24.038 --> 13:24.838
- No no no, mom, no.

13:24.871 --> 13:26.007
We're not taking that.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.674
No, we're gonna leave
that in the car.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.344
- Coming?
- Yes, thank you.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.915
- Take your time.
- Mom, let's go, let's go.

13:33.948 --> 13:36.283
- I'm taking it with me.

13:36.951 --> 13:38.318
- Okay, just...

13:40.021 --> 13:41.388
So you guys always
pick up ladies

13:41.421 --> 13:42.489
in the church parking lot?

13:42.522 --> 13:43.356
- Totally.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.792
- Yeah. I mean,

13:45.826 --> 13:47.828
I know I need all the help
I can get from the Lord,

13:47.861 --> 13:50.998
especially being Jews
in a Christian Church.

13:51.032 --> 13:52.499
It's 'cause we used to go-

13:52.532 --> 13:53.968
- Sam, Sam, Sam.
- 'Cause my mom would take us.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.502
- You don't have to tell
our whole life history.

13:55.535 --> 13:56.470
- No, no, that's okay.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.039
- Well, he likes to talk.

13:58.072 --> 14:00.607
Tell me ladies, what did you
think of the services even,

14:00.640 --> 14:01.842
by the way?

14:01.875 --> 14:02.809
- Oh, I thought
it was beautiful.

14:02.843 --> 14:03.978
- Yes, I agree.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.446
You know that the parsons
message was completely within?

14:06.480 --> 14:07.915
I thought, the holiday spirit,

14:07.949 --> 14:09.382
don't you, Tina?
- Oh, yes.

14:09.416 --> 14:10.118
- And what about
that little girl?

14:10.151 --> 14:11.718
She was so exquisite.
- Oh God.

14:11.752 --> 14:14.654
The little dancer with
the invisible baby Jesus.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.656
- Wait, are you talking about
the dancer in the beginning?

14:16.690 --> 14:17.491
- Yes.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.692
- Who crushed the baby?

14:18.725 --> 14:20.727
- Yes! Yes, yes.
- You saw that too?

14:20.761 --> 14:22.462
I was like waiting
for this big gasp,

14:22.496 --> 14:23.965
but it was just
an awkward moment.

14:23.998 --> 14:24.932
- Are you making
fun of the girl?

14:24.966 --> 14:26.333
Or are you making fun of Jesus?

14:26.366 --> 14:27.467
- No, I'm not making
fun of anybody.

14:27.501 --> 14:29.003
- No one's making fun of Jesus.

14:29.036 --> 14:29.937
- Well I must have missed it

14:29.971 --> 14:31.139
because I thought that she was-

14:31.172 --> 14:33.807
- Did you not see when she got,
when she crushed the thing?

14:33.840 --> 14:34.741
- No, I didn't see it.

14:34.775 --> 14:36.043
And I'm asking you a question.

14:36.077 --> 14:37.711
Why don't you respect this kid?

14:37.744 --> 14:38.645
- I don't-

14:38.678 --> 14:39.579
No one disrespects the kid.

14:39.613 --> 14:40.847
- Well, it sounds like it.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.349
- You're making this
into something that-

14:42.382 --> 14:43.817
- It sounds like it.

14:43.850 --> 14:45.987
- That was quite
the ride. Thank you.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.389
Bill, I'm sorry
if I offended you.

14:49.422 --> 14:50.524
- Oh, no need to apologize.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.491
It was very nice to meet you.

14:51.525 --> 14:53.293
- You didn't do anything wrong.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.862
- Are you okay?

14:55.896 --> 14:56.530
You sure you don't wanna
come in just for a second?

14:56.563 --> 14:57.965
- Oh yeah.

14:57.999 --> 14:59.766
We met up at church. I'm
sure they're fine.

15:00.902 --> 15:02.836
And I just wanna
sleep in my own bed.

15:02.869 --> 15:03.971
You know how that goes.

15:04.005 --> 15:05.505
- Yeah. Okay.

15:05.539 --> 15:06.373
- Love you.

15:08.542 --> 15:09.342
- Goodnight.

15:09.376 --> 15:10.077
- Goodnight. Bye guys.

15:10.111 --> 15:12.345
Thank you again.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.648
- You don't wanna
spend Christmas Eve
with your daughter?

15:14.681 --> 15:16.650
- Bill.
- I just did.

15:16.683 --> 15:17.851
Isn't it Christmas Eve?

15:19.686 --> 15:21.122
- Only one day a year.

15:21.155 --> 15:23.423
- Oh, we see plenty
of each other.

15:23.456 --> 15:24.357
- Glad to hear it.

15:25.392 --> 15:26.459
- Never enough.

15:38.906 --> 15:41.909
♪ When we are apart ♪

15:43.710 --> 15:47.781
♪ I will remember ♪

15:47.814 --> 15:52.819

15:53.587 --> 15:55.422

I'm gonna lose this.

17:23.244 --> 17:24.477
Oh, come on.

17:24.511 --> 17:25.612
- Double or nothing?
- Fine.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.548
But if the Hawks win, you
gotta give us two free meals.

17:28.581 --> 17:31.152
- All right then. Are
you feeling lucky?

17:32.153 --> 17:33.421
I like it.
- Mm-hmm!

17:35.089 --> 17:36.257
- Hey Bill.
- What?

17:36.290 --> 17:37.624
- Merry Christmas.

17:39.260 --> 17:40.460
- I gotta give you yours

17:43.998 --> 17:45.598
Thought I forgot. Huh?

17:45.632 --> 17:46.666
- You go first.

17:46.700 --> 17:47.534

17:48.269 --> 17:49.869
Dah dun dah dah!

17:49.904 --> 17:52.839
Dah dun dun dun dah dah dah-

17:52.872 --> 17:54.674
- You know you said you wanted
to learn about gardening, so.

17:54.708 --> 17:56.177
- Yeah, I did.

17:56.210 --> 17:57.211
That's what this is?

17:59.612 --> 18:01.015
That's very sweet of you, Sammy.

18:03.951 --> 18:04.952
Okay. Your turn.

18:06.120 --> 18:06.921
- Okay. Okay.

18:06.954 --> 18:07.787
What do we got?

18:09.123 --> 18:10.557
- See that?

18:10.590 --> 18:13.593
I cleaned out the garage
and that was in the back

18:13.626 --> 18:16.629
with a bike that hasn't been
ridden in about 40 years.

18:16.663 --> 18:17.965
- Oh, this is awesome.

18:17.999 --> 18:18.898
I love when the,

18:18.933 --> 18:21.268
the pages get aged and like-

18:21.302 --> 18:23.304
- Yeah, well, you know, I'm
not good at giving gifts,

18:23.337 --> 18:25.172
but you know how
far back this goes?

18:25.206 --> 18:26.273
- This is a great gift.

18:26.307 --> 18:29.276
- Way back, when I was
fooling around with a pencil.

18:32.579 --> 18:33.747
Oh. Oh wow.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.548
The Hawks might
win this after all.

18:36.951 --> 18:38.585
- Up at
the free throw line.

18:38.618 --> 18:39.987
- Hey, what are you doing there?

18:40.021 --> 18:41.055
- Hang on, hang on, hang on.

18:42.023 --> 18:43.656
One second, please.

18:43.690 --> 18:44.492
- You drawing something?

18:44.524 --> 18:45.759
- If you move,
you're gonna ruin it.

18:48.195 --> 18:48.996
- Ah!

18:50.764 --> 18:52.133
Did you just do this?

18:52.166 --> 18:53.566
- Merry Christmas, Bob.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.635
- Well, thank you, Sam.

18:55.668 --> 18:59.106
See, did you see what
your son just drew?

18:59.140 --> 19:01.042
- Yeah, I know,
he's very talented.

19:01.075 --> 19:03.144
Maybe one day he's gonna
do something with it.

19:03.177 --> 19:05.645
Oh, shit.

19:05.678 --> 19:08.049
Referee just iced him.

19:08.082 --> 19:09.716
- Merry Christmas, brother.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.718
Hey, I wanted to let you know

19:11.751 --> 19:13.320
I'm not gonna be at
the factory anymore.

19:13.354 --> 19:14.754
I quit.

19:14.788 --> 19:16.623
And this is what's
happening now.

19:18.392 --> 19:20.294
- Sam, here's your pie.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.098
- Also,

19:24.131 --> 19:27.902
it's the afternoon and
I'm not wearing any pants.

19:27.935 --> 19:29.303
And that's the shit!

19:29.336 --> 19:30.271
- Good heavens.

19:30.304 --> 19:32.273
What on Earth is he doing?

19:33.374 --> 19:35.642
The company you keep, Sammy,

19:35.675 --> 19:36.709
the company you keep.

19:41.382 --> 19:42.216
- It's me!

19:43.850 --> 19:47.854
Mom.

19:47.887 --> 19:48.721
Hello?

19:49.689 --> 19:51.624
Mom. It's me.

19:51.658 --> 19:52.659
Hi.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.661
- Katie!

19:54.694 --> 19:56.163
Katie, what are you doing here?

19:56.197 --> 19:57.864
I thought I was
supposed to come to you.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.366
- I know, but I just thought
it'd come surprise you.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.002
- Well, I wish you would've
at least called me first.

20:02.036 --> 20:03.803
- Why, you have
someone in there?

20:03.837 --> 20:04.637
Oh my God.

20:04.671 --> 20:05.672
Did Bill stay over?

20:05.705 --> 20:06.407
- Oh, good heavens.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.275
No. Now just stop it.

20:08.309 --> 20:10.144
- This is ridiculous.
Mom, let me in.

20:11.778 --> 20:15.349
- Wait, I just need-

20:15.382 --> 20:17.650
- Mom, it's cold.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.154
Unchain the fucking door.

20:21.688 --> 20:24.425
- That's no way to talk
on Christmas day, Katie.

20:24.458 --> 20:25.692
- I'm sorry.

20:26.360 --> 20:28.062
Please unchain the fucking door.

20:28.095 --> 20:28.929
- Oh.

20:30.297 --> 20:33.867
I just have to finish dressing
and I'll grab my stuff,

20:33.900 --> 20:36.203
and I have something for you.

20:36.237 --> 20:39.440
- Okay.

20:39.473 --> 20:42.109
Hey, do you still
have your trike?

20:58.758 --> 21:00.693
- You need a bigger tree.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.729
Or smaller house.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.331
- Definitely not that.

21:04.365 --> 21:06.866
Oh, I have something for you.

21:09.370 --> 21:11.071
- Hey.
- I didn't really wrap it.

21:16.776 --> 21:17.877
- Oh my word!

21:19.280 --> 21:20.114
- I made it.

21:23.117 --> 21:24.717
- Katie. Thank you.

21:24.751 --> 21:27.087
- And then there's another,
there's another part.

21:34.528 --> 21:35.930
- You made this too?

21:35.963 --> 21:36.796
- Yeah.

21:40.267 --> 21:41.202
Oh, it looks good.

21:41.235 --> 21:43.504
It looks so good.

21:43.537 --> 21:44.737
- Thank you.

21:44.771 --> 21:45.506
I love you so much.

21:45.539 --> 21:46.941
- I love you too.

21:49.210 --> 21:50.710
Merry Christmas.

21:52.179 --> 21:53.147
- Thank you.

21:54.814 --> 21:58.818
I don't really have
a Christmas present.

22:00.421 --> 22:01.522
I found these at the house,

22:01.555 --> 22:03.723
and I thought you
should have them.

22:10.897 --> 22:12.765
Fancy ribbon.

22:39.293 --> 22:43.830
♪ Just waiting for
that magic night ♪

22:50.104 --> 22:51.171
- I'm sorry.

22:51.205 --> 22:52.772
I'll be right back.

22:59.580 --> 23:00.481
- Sammy.

23:00.514 --> 23:02.983
Get that, that piece
of shit out of there.

23:03.017 --> 23:04.918
Okay. You see this?

23:04.952 --> 23:07.454
You water this every
other day. Not every day.

23:07.488 --> 23:09.023
You always get it backwards.

23:09.056 --> 23:10.057
I'm ready for my breakfast.

23:10.090 --> 23:11.091
- Here, try this.

23:14.628 --> 23:15.529
- Hmm.

23:15.562 --> 23:16.363
- Yeah, it's good, right?

23:16.397 --> 23:18.098
- Yes. Yes it is.

23:18.132 --> 23:18.966
Yeah.

23:21.402 --> 23:22.202
- It's tofu.

23:22.236 --> 23:23.137
- What?

23:23.170 --> 23:24.305
- It's tofu.

23:24.338 --> 23:26.407
- Prick, I might
have spoken too soon.

23:26.440 --> 23:27.474
- You got a text?

23:30.611 --> 23:32.079
- It's blank.

23:32.112 --> 23:32.946
- Here, I'll do it.

23:32.980 --> 23:34.081
- What do you punch?

23:34.114 --> 23:35.382
- Here, here.

23:35.416 --> 23:36.583
- Oh.
- Ah,

23:36.617 --> 23:37.384
looks like Tina
enjoyed meeting you.

23:37.418 --> 23:39.186
- Oh, What?

23:39.219 --> 23:40.954
- You gave her your
number, mister sly dog?

23:40.988 --> 23:42.623
- I did not.

23:42.656 --> 23:44.158
I called her to apologize.

23:44.191 --> 23:45.426
- Wait, what?

23:45.459 --> 23:46.593
- I said I called
her to apologize.

23:46.627 --> 23:48.295
Get outta here.

23:48.329 --> 23:49.862
- Okay. But I don't know why
you're taking this, like-

23:49.896 --> 23:51.198
- Will you get
outta here please?

23:51.231 --> 23:52.366
- It's a good thing.

23:52.399 --> 23:53.500
- Oh, will you please
get outta here?

23:53.534 --> 23:54.335
- Alright. Alright.

23:54.368 --> 23:55.969
Alright.

23:56.003 --> 23:57.471
Hey Bill, real quick.

23:57.504 --> 23:59.239
You apologized. What did
that feel like for you?

23:59.273 --> 24:00.641
- Here's your sausage.

24:00.674 --> 24:03.610
- It's tofu.

24:03.644 --> 24:04.645
- Tina!

24:04.678 --> 24:05.512
- Hi Beth.

24:06.447 --> 24:08.916
- I'm so glad you're back.

24:08.949 --> 24:10.351
- Thank you, Beth.

24:10.384 --> 24:12.953
- I sure wish you'd
rejoin the choir.

24:12.986 --> 24:15.989
You know, singing heals
the heart, always.

24:18.025 --> 24:19.226
- I know.

24:19.259 --> 24:21.128
I'm just not quite
ready to come back.

24:21.161 --> 24:22.463
- Is everything okay?

24:24.031 --> 24:25.898
- Yes, it's fine.

24:28.202 --> 24:30.170
I just didn't sleep last night.

24:30.204 --> 24:32.673
- Oh, I understand.

24:32.706 --> 24:34.241
I know all about insomnia.

24:34.274 --> 24:36.210
I get it really bad sometimes.
- Do you?

24:36.243 --> 24:38.545
- Yeah, but you know
what actually helps me?

24:38.579 --> 24:39.480
- What's that?

24:39.513 --> 24:41.315
- A nice glass of red wine!

24:42.182 --> 24:42.983
- Yeah.

24:43.016 --> 24:44.051
- Or even,

24:45.352 --> 24:47.020
the Mary J.

24:47.054 --> 24:48.622
- The what?

24:48.655 --> 24:50.190
- Marijuana.

24:50.224 --> 24:51.558
- Oh!

24:51.592 --> 24:53.961
- I know they say it's a
drug and drugs are bad.

24:53.994 --> 24:55.362
But I will tell you what,

24:55.396 --> 24:58.332
that plant works and
they're legalizing it

24:58.365 --> 24:59.700
all across the country.
- Is that right?

24:59.733 --> 25:01.368
- Yeah.

25:01.402 --> 25:02.403
Yeah.

25:02.436 --> 25:03.670
Don't tell anybody I told you.

25:03.704 --> 25:08.041
- Oh, good heavens, no,
I wouldn't think of it.

25:14.515 --> 25:16.984
♪ You have the
chance to win this ♪

25:17.017 --> 25:18.619
- Let's get you off there, Bill.

25:27.594 --> 25:29.062
Irregular heartbeats.

25:29.096 --> 25:30.964
- Oh, there's a lot that's
irregular about him.

25:30.998 --> 25:32.032
- Ha ha.

25:33.734 --> 25:35.369
- What about not
smoking, not drinking.

25:35.402 --> 25:38.071
No red meat.
- Sam, shut the fuck up, huh?

25:41.208 --> 25:42.509
- Here's his prescription.

25:49.249 --> 25:50.317
- Is that in the way?

25:51.785 --> 25:53.120
Is that in the way?
- What?

25:53.153 --> 25:54.188
- What?

25:54.221 --> 25:56.023
- What are you-

25:56.056 --> 25:57.124
Not cool, Bill!

25:57.157 --> 25:59.092
- You can't see with that
stupid thing in the way.

25:59.126 --> 26:01.195
- It's a vintage,
spooky skeleton.

26:01.228 --> 26:02.262
- Vintage shit.

26:03.197 --> 26:05.098
Just drive the car safely.

26:05.132 --> 26:06.166
- It's a collectors item.

26:06.200 --> 26:09.503
- Help me out.

26:10.537 --> 26:11.438
Come on, let's go.

26:13.173 --> 26:14.608
- Yeah yeah yeah.

26:17.344 --> 26:18.178
Really, Bill?

26:18.212 --> 26:19.379
- Yeah.

26:19.413 --> 26:20.614
- We're leaving the
doctor's office.

26:20.647 --> 26:22.282
You can't go five
minutes without-

26:22.316 --> 26:23.484
- Without what?

26:23.517 --> 26:26.086
Can't smoke, can't
drink, can't eat meat.

26:26.119 --> 26:28.021
We're all gonna
die someday, Sammy.

26:28.055 --> 26:30.190
- I know, but I'd like
for you to be around for-

26:30.224 --> 26:31.692
- For what?

26:31.725 --> 26:33.594
- For what?
- Yeah, For what?

26:33.627 --> 26:36.697
- I don't know. I mean,
maybe someday if I,

26:37.631 --> 26:41.435
if I have a family or...
- Family?

26:41.468 --> 26:44.137
- Okay. What is your issue?

26:44.171 --> 26:45.439
- What do you mean issue?

26:45.472 --> 26:46.707
- Why are you so angry?

26:46.740 --> 26:48.308
And don't say it's
'cause mom's gone.

26:48.342 --> 26:51.111
'Cause truthfully, you were
this way when she was here.

26:52.513 --> 26:54.481
- I was supposed
to go before her.

26:54.515 --> 26:56.383
I'm the one with the hard shit.

26:58.151 --> 26:59.152
Pull over.

27:05.559 --> 27:06.727
- Look, Bill.

27:06.760 --> 27:08.161
If you need someone
to talk to, man,

27:08.195 --> 27:10.330
you can always talk
to me about anything.

27:10.364 --> 27:11.164
I'm just,

27:13.467 --> 27:14.501
not trying to fight with you.

27:14.535 --> 27:15.602
I'm trying to listen.

27:17.204 --> 27:21.375
I don't, I just want
you to be happy.

27:29.583 --> 27:31.084
- Give me your sketchbook.

27:33.220 --> 27:34.087
You got a pencil?

27:39.793 --> 27:40.694
Okay, Sammy.

27:42.863 --> 27:44.097
You see that?

27:44.798 --> 27:46.433
That's life.

27:46.466 --> 27:48.235
You got half of yours left.

27:50.370 --> 27:52.639
I don't even have a slice left.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.148
I'm on gravy time.

28:15.562 --> 28:16.463
- Hey, come on, Bill.

28:16.496 --> 28:17.664
Get back in the car, man.

28:21.268 --> 28:22.402
Come on Mr. Gravy.

28:23.270 --> 28:24.504
I'm kidding. Bill.

28:25.639 --> 28:27.240
- I know I've said
this a million times,

28:27.274 --> 28:29.543
but I really think you
should consider donating

28:29.576 --> 28:31.478
some of your stuff.
- I know.

28:31.511 --> 28:34.581
- You just have so much good
stuff that people would love.

28:34.615 --> 28:35.882
And you're not using it.
- Katie, just finding things

28:35.917 --> 28:37.884
that I'm willing to part with.

28:37.919 --> 28:39.020
- Right, hi.

28:39.053 --> 28:41.221
- Look at all these good
things you're getting rid of.

28:41.254 --> 28:43.256
- Yeah. And I'm not
using them anymore.

28:43.290 --> 28:44.558
So I'm paying 'em forward.

28:49.396 --> 28:50.864
Are you taking
stuff from my box?

28:50.897 --> 28:52.399
- No, I'm just looking.

28:52.432 --> 28:54.201
- Okay. Please
don't take anything.

28:58.372 --> 28:59.606
- Wait.

28:59.640 --> 29:01.441
Are you sure you wanna
get rid of this coat?

29:01.475 --> 29:02.944
- Yeah, I'm sure.

29:02.977 --> 29:05.779
- Well, I'm not sure
that you should.

29:07.214 --> 29:08.215
- Mom, we're not doing this.

29:08.248 --> 29:09.750
Please let me take it.
- Look.

29:09.783 --> 29:12.185
It was my idea for you to get
this coat in the first place.

29:12.219 --> 29:14.588
I think I should at least
have some sort of say

29:14.621 --> 29:15.856
over what happens to it.

29:15.889 --> 29:16.958
- Mom, you don't need it.

29:16.991 --> 29:19.159
Just let me donate it.

29:20.560 --> 29:22.462
You can take it.
- Fine. I don't need it.

29:23.397 --> 29:24.431
Bye.
- Bye!

29:37.477 --> 29:38.879
- I'm just,

29:38.913 --> 29:40.180
I'm just gonna take this.

29:54.294 --> 29:59.299
♪ When I look into your eyes ♪

30:00.267 --> 30:02.636
♪ They made me realize ♪

30:04.805 --> 30:06.873
- Excuse me there.
Pardon me, love.

30:06.908 --> 30:09.242
I just wondered if
I could talk to you.

30:09.276 --> 30:10.277
It's London calling.

30:10.310 --> 30:10.978
- Oh hi.

30:12.779 --> 30:13.814
- Oh.

30:13.847 --> 30:16.850
Did not, did not take you
for a Rod Stewart fan.

30:16.883 --> 30:17.684
- Yeah.

30:17.718 --> 30:18.885
- That outfit is...

30:20.988 --> 30:22.856
Can you imagine if you
looked up and I was wearing

30:22.889 --> 30:23.757
that exact same thing?

30:23.790 --> 30:25.927
Like, hey there, Katie.

30:25.960 --> 30:28.662
I think I got something
to say to you.

30:28.695 --> 30:29.663
- That's good.

30:29.696 --> 30:31.865
- It's not good.
35 bucks though.

30:31.898 --> 30:33.333
- I know.

30:33.366 --> 30:35.268
It's an investment, but
I think it's a good one.

30:35.302 --> 30:37.604
- Okay. If you say so.

30:39.406 --> 30:42.476
I wonder if they have
a folk section here.

30:43.710 --> 30:45.046
It'd be pretty cool
to find your album.

30:45.079 --> 30:46.013
- What did you say?

30:46.047 --> 30:47.547
- Okay. I have a confession.

30:47.581 --> 30:49.483
I Googled you.

30:49.516 --> 30:51.351
Albeit, that's not
normally how I roll.

30:51.384 --> 30:53.054
I know. I just,
I shouldn't have.

30:53.087 --> 30:56.690
But I found your music
and it's amazing.

30:56.723 --> 30:58.025
- Don't Google me.

30:58.059 --> 30:59.994
- Well, I feel weird now
that I said that out loud.

31:00.027 --> 31:00.861
I'm sorry.

31:03.830 --> 31:05.866
- Actually, I gotta get going.

31:05.899 --> 31:07.068
- Yeah, yeah.

31:07.101 --> 31:09.937
- It's nothing you
said. I just have to go.

31:09.971 --> 31:11.005
- Oh. Oh, yeah.

31:11.038 --> 31:12.539
Okay. No problem.

31:12.572 --> 31:13.774
- Good to see you, Sam.

31:13.807 --> 31:14.741
- Good, good to
see you too, Kate.

31:14.775 --> 31:15.943
- Thanks, Orian.

31:22.083 --> 31:23.517
- Hey Kate. Wait up.

31:23.550 --> 31:25.086
- Hey man. Hey, hey!

31:25.119 --> 31:25.886
You gotta pay for that!

31:25.920 --> 31:28.588
- Dude, just, I'll
be back, okay?

31:28.622 --> 31:29.523
Calm down.

31:29.556 --> 31:30.657
- So outta your league, bro.

31:31.758 --> 31:33.426
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:33.460 --> 31:35.096
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
make you feel uncomfortable.

31:35.129 --> 31:36.630
I-
- That's all right.

31:38.365 --> 31:39.566
- You going to the bookshop?

31:41.035 --> 31:42.069
- Yeah, I was just gonna
grab a coffee on the way.

31:42.103 --> 31:44.437
- Well, can I get your coffee?

31:44.471 --> 31:45.372
- No thanks.

31:45.405 --> 31:46.406
- Not a date,

31:46.439 --> 31:47.841
just a friendly
chat with caffeine.

31:49.476 --> 31:52.746
I'll even show you my,
my sacred sketchbook.

31:54.115 --> 31:55.315
- All right.

31:57.384 --> 31:59.120
- Sorry to hear about your car.

31:59.153 --> 32:01.888
You know, Bill's really
good at fixing old cars.

32:01.923 --> 32:02.722
- Oh, it's okay.

32:02.756 --> 32:04.058
I'll get it figured out.

32:05.026 --> 32:06.726
Wait, so he is your dad, right?

32:07.694 --> 32:09.964
'Cause I just noticed
you only call him Bill.

32:09.997 --> 32:12.465
- Yeah. No, he's my dad.

32:12.499 --> 32:14.101
Bill thinks only
children should refer

32:14.135 --> 32:15.869
to their parents as dad.

32:15.903 --> 32:18.005
So, or fathers as dad.

32:18.039 --> 32:19.506
I'm a grown man,

32:19.539 --> 32:21.474
so I refer to him by his name.

32:21.508 --> 32:22.509
Bill.

32:23.443 --> 32:24.946
Fun started when I was 16.

32:26.446 --> 32:27.114
- Okay.

32:27.148 --> 32:28.849
Stop stalling.

32:28.882 --> 32:31.685
- Okay, just to clarify, when
I told you that it was sacred,

32:31.718 --> 32:34.155
I just meant like,
it means a lot to me.

32:34.188 --> 32:35.522
I'm not saying it's
good or anything.

32:35.555 --> 32:36.389
- Yeah.

32:47.534 --> 32:48.635
- What is she thinking?

32:50.570 --> 32:52.839
- So did you like
train for this?

32:52.873 --> 32:54.841
Did you take, I
don't know, courses?

32:54.875 --> 32:59.779
- I did take a couple
classes, but nothing like too-

33:01.448 --> 33:04.484
I was actually working at
this little company though,

33:04.517 --> 33:06.486
before I came back
to take care of Bill.

33:07.754 --> 33:09.422
- What kind of company?

33:09.456 --> 33:12.759
- Just like a really small
boutique comic book company

33:12.792 --> 33:14.427
that I'm sure you'd
never heard of.

33:14.461 --> 33:16.163
- Comic books. Okay.

33:16.197 --> 33:18.032
So where do you work now?

33:18.065 --> 33:20.533
- I work at the, at
the Chocolate Factory.

33:20.567 --> 33:21.903
- I know the Chocolate Factory.

33:21.936 --> 33:23.070
I mean, I don't,

33:23.104 --> 33:23.870
I've never known anyone
that worked there,

33:23.905 --> 33:26.073
but do you enjoy that?

33:26.107 --> 33:27.174
- Not really, no.

33:27.208 --> 33:28.808
But the pay is lousy.

33:31.511 --> 33:35.016
- Okay. So then why
the Chocolate Factory?

33:35.049 --> 33:35.849
- I don't know.

33:35.882 --> 33:37.118
I, you know,

33:37.151 --> 33:38.885
I used to work there
when I was younger

33:38.920 --> 33:43.925
and then I just kind of
found my way back there.

33:44.158 --> 33:44.824
- I mean.

33:46.593 --> 33:47.761
- What?
- You just have,

33:47.794 --> 33:50.730
you're really talented and it
just seems like you should be

33:50.764 --> 33:53.067
doing something
with this, you know?

33:53.100 --> 33:54.567
- You sound like Bill.

33:54.601 --> 33:56.569
- Well, I think he knows
what he's talking about.

34:00.840 --> 34:02.977
I think they forgot my sugar.

34:03.010 --> 34:04.711
- Look, I can get that.

34:04.744 --> 34:05.645
- Okay. Thank you.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.263
I actually need
to get to my shop.

34:22.296 --> 34:23.965
- Oh, okay.

34:23.998 --> 34:24.798
Your shop?

34:24.831 --> 34:25.632
- Yeah, it's my shop.

34:25.665 --> 34:26.533
I own it.

34:26.566 --> 34:27.767
- Oh.

34:27.801 --> 34:28.568
find that out when
you Googled me?

34:28.601 --> 34:29.803
- Did not know that.

34:29.836 --> 34:31.805
- Yeah.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

34:31.838 --> 34:35.542
- We actually have a small but
good art section at the shop

34:35.575 --> 34:36.643
that you might find interesting.

34:36.676 --> 34:37.278
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:37.311 --> 34:38.745
- Oh, okay.

- Wow.

34:45.552 --> 34:46.753
That lady was a-

34:46.786 --> 34:50.291
- No way. You guys have
a Philip Guston book?

34:50.324 --> 34:51.292
He's my favorite artist.

34:51.325 --> 34:53.160
It's so cool that you have this.

34:53.194 --> 34:53.995
- Hi there.

34:54.028 --> 34:55.129
- Oh, this is Sam.

34:55.162 --> 34:56.197

34:56.230 --> 34:57.131
- Sam.
- Nice to meet you.

34:57.164 --> 34:58.565
- Pleasure to meet you, Mary.

34:58.598 --> 35:00.667
Oh my God. This guy's
work is amazing.

35:00.700 --> 35:02.635
It's like cartoon style

35:02.669 --> 35:04.005
and doesn't take
itself too seriously,

35:04.038 --> 35:06.840
but they still put it
up in the MOMA and shit.

35:06.873 --> 35:08.708
The ultimate rebel
amongst rebels.

35:08.742 --> 35:10.111
- He's great.
- Yeah.

35:10.144 --> 35:11.578
- Yeah. The colors
are beautiful.

35:13.147 --> 35:15.615
- Do you wanna exchange numbers?

35:15.648 --> 35:17.650
- Um, not today.

35:18.685 --> 35:19.586
- Maybe tomorrow?

35:19.619 --> 35:20.620
- Maybe.

35:20.653 --> 35:21.322
- Okay. Okay.

35:21.355 --> 35:22.323
Not now.

35:22.356 --> 35:23.890
- Thank you for the coffee.

35:24.824 --> 35:26.093
- Right.

35:26.127 --> 35:28.828
I think it's, that means
I'm supposed to go now.

35:33.200 --> 35:34.567
Okay.
- Okay.

35:34.601 --> 35:35.903
- Bye.

35:35.936 --> 35:36.770
- Bye.

35:40.607 --> 35:41.308
What?

35:41.342 --> 35:42.642
- What do you mean, what?

35:42.675 --> 35:43.310
Did you guys have a coffee date?

35:43.344 --> 35:44.577
- No, it wasn't a date.

35:44.611 --> 35:46.080
- Okay. He was so cute.

35:46.113 --> 35:47.680
And he was into you,

35:47.714 --> 35:48.815
and he loves art!

35:49.682 --> 35:50.583
- Okay, settle down.

35:50.617 --> 35:52.086
- Okay. All right.

35:52.119 --> 35:56.190
I just thought you guys look
cute together. That's all.

35:56.223 --> 35:57.158
Keep my mouth shut.

36:17.178 --> 36:19.380
- I got it. I got it.

36:21.182 --> 36:23.084
Is that, is that Tina?

36:23.117 --> 36:24.684
That's her, pull over.

36:30.191 --> 36:31.658
Hi.

36:31.691 --> 36:32.625
- Well, hello there.

36:32.659 --> 36:33.893
- Now technically,

36:33.928 --> 36:36.629
we are not in the church
parking lot pickup spot.

36:36.663 --> 36:38.631
- Well then I guess
I will just continue

36:38.665 --> 36:40.034
waiting for the bus.

36:40.067 --> 36:40.900
- Or,

36:42.069 --> 36:43.971
my son Sam and I

36:44.004 --> 36:47.074
would be more than honored to
take you wherever you'd like.

36:47.108 --> 36:48.675
- Now, that's more like it.

36:48.708 --> 36:49.376
I accept.

36:51.778 --> 36:55.416
You think you two can
behave yourself this time?

36:55.449 --> 36:56.383
- Hi Tina.

36:56.417 --> 36:59.153
- So Tina, you,
you don't have a car?

36:59.186 --> 37:00.387
I mean-

37:00.421 --> 37:01.422
- No, no.

37:01.455 --> 37:03.723
I walk or take the bus.

37:03.756 --> 37:05.725
Sometimes Katie drives me,

37:05.758 --> 37:08.728
but her car's still not running.

37:08.761 --> 37:09.662
- Kate, let me see it.

37:15.236 --> 37:17.004
Okay. Oh,.

37:17.037 --> 37:18.705
Sammy, pop the hood.

37:20.374 --> 37:24.777
These gentlemen said you need
new spark plugs, new tires,

37:24.811 --> 37:25.712
and a new carburetor.

37:25.745 --> 37:27.714
But your car is fuel-injected.

37:27.747 --> 37:29.150
You got ripped off,
they're criminals.

37:29.183 --> 37:29.984
Don't worry,

37:30.017 --> 37:31.152
we're gonna fix you up.

37:32.286 --> 37:35.256
And gimme a flathead
screwdriver.

37:35.289 --> 37:36.323
Hey, don't worry.

37:38.058 --> 37:39.893
I see a worried look on you.

37:42.329 --> 37:43.730
You have a light?

37:43.763 --> 37:44.331
- Yeah, yeah. Here.
- Okay. A little more.

37:44.365 --> 37:46.967
A little more, closer.

37:47.001 --> 37:49.436
Give me a, shine
something on it.

37:50.437 --> 37:52.439
- I'm thinking he might
just be able to fix it.

37:52.473 --> 37:53.908
- I feel like I need to pay him.

37:53.941 --> 37:54.807
- Oh, no.

37:54.841 --> 37:56.143
Sam said don't pay him.

37:57.311 --> 37:59.746
- Ladies.
- Don't wanna embarrass him.

37:59.779 --> 38:01.248
- Do you have a
big old frying pan

38:01.282 --> 38:03.050
that you don't use anymore?

38:03.083 --> 38:04.485
- Frying pan?

38:04.518 --> 38:05.718
- Yeah.

38:05.752 --> 38:07.288
- And a couple of beers.

38:08.788 --> 38:10.257
- Let's see if you get
the car running first.

38:10.291 --> 38:11.824
- You're tough.

38:14.995 --> 38:18.831
- Oh, that's way too nice.

38:18.865 --> 38:19.832
We'll just go to the
auto parts store.

38:19.866 --> 38:20.968
It's nearby.

38:21.001 --> 38:22.136
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah yeah.

38:22.169 --> 38:23.836
- Thank you.

38:23.870 --> 38:24.939
Well, keep your receipts and
I'll pay you back for anything

38:24.972 --> 38:25.872
you spend on parts.

38:25.906 --> 38:26.806
- No, no.

38:26.839 --> 38:27.807
Bill. You're not driving.

38:27.840 --> 38:28.409
You're not driving.

38:28.442 --> 38:29.210
- Thank you guys.

38:29.243 --> 38:30.077
- It's our pleasure.

38:32.046 --> 38:32.947
- I know.

38:32.980 --> 38:34.814
We need to cook for them.

38:34.847 --> 38:35.616
- What?
- That's what we can do.

38:35.649 --> 38:37.151
We can cook for them.

38:37.184 --> 38:39.420
I think it'd be a nice
gesture if they fix your car.

38:39.453 --> 38:40.454
Get it running.

38:41.788 --> 38:42.755
- What if they don't
get it running?

38:42.789 --> 38:45.993
- Well then we'll just
make 'em mow the yard.

38:46.026 --> 38:47.860
- That's a great idea.

38:48.929 --> 38:50.830
Don't think I don't see your
sneaky little angle, though.

38:50.863 --> 38:51.966
- What are you talking about?

38:51.999 --> 38:54.401
- A7, Sammy, air filter, okay?

38:54.435 --> 38:55.835
- I'm looking.

38:55.868 --> 38:57.004
- Okay.

38:57.037 --> 38:59.173
- By the way, Bill, I didn't
mean to get y'all worked up

38:59.206 --> 39:00.807
the other day.

39:00.840 --> 39:02.376
- You got upset because I
ripped your toy off the mirror.

39:02.409 --> 39:04.245
- No, that was just
mildly annoying.

39:04.278 --> 39:05.512
I'm talking about-

39:05.546 --> 39:06.447
- I know what you're
talking about, Sam.

39:06.480 --> 39:10.850
Can we just focus on
the task at hand please?

39:10.883 --> 39:12.920
And maybe you can remember
that your time here with me

39:12.953 --> 39:13.921
is finite, okay?

39:13.954 --> 39:15.723
So let's get the
work done first.

39:16.557 --> 39:18.192
Okay?

39:18.225 --> 39:19.792
- Bill.

39:19.826 --> 39:20.928
Should we go, Mr. Finite?

39:20.961 --> 39:24.831
- Sammy Boy, sometimes
you surprise me.

39:25.599 --> 39:26.567
- Now?
- Hit it.

39:31.939 --> 39:32.772
- Oh!

39:33.840 --> 39:35.042
- Oh, wait a minute.

39:35.075 --> 39:37.177
I'll take an embrace.

39:37.211 --> 39:39.146
- Would you guys like
to stay for dinner?

39:39.179 --> 39:40.880
- So good!
- Oh.

39:40.914 --> 39:42.549
You know, we would, but I
got, Bill's got a routine.

39:42.583 --> 39:43.350
I gotta get him home.
- No no no no no.

39:43.384 --> 39:45.919
I'd love, I'd love
to be invited.

39:45.953 --> 39:47.554
- Well then come on!

39:47.588 --> 39:48.555
- What have you got?

39:48.589 --> 39:49.957
- It's a surprise.

39:49.990 --> 39:51.858
- Dear God.

39:51.891 --> 39:56.563
Thank you for this lovely meal
and thank you for forgiving

39:56.597 --> 40:00.434
our sins, for there
are many of them.

40:01.402 --> 40:06.540
And may you punish those
vicious criminal car mechanics

40:07.908 --> 40:09.310
for not seeing the
error of their ways,

40:09.343 --> 40:10.978
'cause they ain't
gonna do it, dear God.

40:11.011 --> 40:11.912
Amen.

40:11.945 --> 40:13.013
- Amen.
- Amen.

40:15.482 --> 40:16.417
- Oh, thank you.

40:18.218 --> 40:19.586
- Excuse me.
- Tina.

40:19.620 --> 40:20.454
- Oh.

40:22.189 --> 40:24.024
Oh!

40:24.058 --> 40:25.059
- Oh. Sorry.

40:26.193 --> 40:27.394
- That's too much.

40:27.428 --> 40:29.263
- That's how you
keep your figure.

40:29.296 --> 40:30.497
Is that okay?

40:30.531 --> 40:32.533
- That's great.
Thank you so much.

40:32.566 --> 40:34.635
- Ooh, I see what you did there.

40:36.136 --> 40:38.138
Thank you so much
for this whole,

40:38.172 --> 40:40.040
whole thing is really
so sweet of you both.

40:40.074 --> 40:42.943
- Oh, well it was really
sweet of you to fix my car.

40:42.976 --> 40:43.977
- I can't really take credit.

40:44.011 --> 40:45.179
It was all Bill.

40:45.212 --> 40:47.847
- No, my son was part of it.

40:49.316 --> 40:53.954
So, a little bird tells me
you own your own bookstore.

40:55.456 --> 40:58.459
- She's had that bookstore
for, what, two years now?

40:58.492 --> 40:59.493
- That's right, yeah.

40:59.526 --> 41:01.995
- Actually Bill, the
gardening book I got you.

41:02.029 --> 41:02.963
That's where I got it from.

41:02.996 --> 41:03.597
- Oh.

41:03.630 --> 41:04.665
- Yeah, that was a find.

41:04.698 --> 41:06.967
We don't get books like
that in the shop very much.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.001
- You should really
check it out though.

41:08.035 --> 41:10.204
They have all these amazing
old rare books there.

41:10.237 --> 41:12.172
You would really like it.

41:12.206 --> 41:15.442
- So a rare young lady
sells rare old books.

41:16.410 --> 41:17.578
- She's a rare one.

41:18.645 --> 41:19.546
- Word of the night.

41:19.580 --> 41:21.248
- Well, let's drink to that.

41:21.281 --> 41:22.182
- Cheers.

41:22.216 --> 41:26.019
- All of us.

41:26.053 --> 41:26.920
It's good.

41:26.954 --> 41:28.322
- Well, I hope you
liked your pot pies.

41:28.355 --> 41:29.490
- Oh, it's great.

41:29.523 --> 41:32.393
- They were vegetarian
and gluten free.

41:32.426 --> 41:34.328
- You guys are sneaky.

41:34.361 --> 41:36.096
Sam does the same thing to me.

41:36.130 --> 41:37.498
I mean, it tastes so good.

41:37.531 --> 41:39.466
You can't tell the difference.

41:39.500 --> 41:42.403
It was really good.
I hate to admit it.

43:27.074 --> 43:28.141
- Yeah.

43:28.175 --> 43:30.577
- I can't say that I do.

43:30.611 --> 43:34.014
- It's all these
amazing photographs.

43:34.983 --> 43:37.518
Let's see. I feel like you
being an artist would love this.

43:37.551 --> 43:39.453
- Well, I'm not
really an artist.

43:40.654 --> 43:42.623
- You are what you
say you are, Sam.

43:42.656 --> 43:44.291
- Really? You think
that's how it works?

43:44.324 --> 43:46.159
I wish that's how it works.

43:46.193 --> 43:47.761
If it was, I'd be in
the NBA right now.

43:47.794 --> 43:49.196
- No, you're way too short.

43:49.229 --> 43:50.564
- Okay. That's not nice.

43:50.597 --> 43:53.166
You know, Spud Webb was 5'7".

43:53.200 --> 43:54.067
He won the dunk contest.

43:54.101 --> 43:56.203
How come you didn't
give me your number?

43:57.070 --> 43:59.406
- Maybe I did. And you
just didn't notice.

43:59.439 --> 44:02.109
- Oh, I'm pretty sure I
would've noticed that.

44:02.142 --> 44:03.577
You're being very
mysterious right now.

44:05.112 --> 44:06.313
I love this.

44:06.346 --> 44:07.781
- Yeah. Oh.

44:07.814 --> 44:09.283
- Even though it's
falling apart,

44:09.316 --> 44:11.618
there's still something
so beautiful about it.

44:14.488 --> 44:18.258
How are you still single? It
just doesn't make any sense.

44:18.292 --> 44:21.628
Is that a weird thing to
say? It makes no sense.

44:22.896 --> 44:23.730
- Why are you?

44:25.132 --> 44:27.868
- Complete insecurity.
Self-loathing.

44:27.901 --> 44:31.505
Gotta love yourself first
and I'm working on that.

45:02.269 --> 45:03.103
I'm okay.

46:03.430 --> 46:04.631

46:04.665 --> 46:05.832
- Mm-hmm.
- You sure?

46:05.866 --> 46:06.700
- Mm-hmm.

46:13.240 --> 46:14.374
- What's that?

46:14.408 --> 46:16.543
That's a bit
redundant, isn't it?

46:16.576 --> 46:18.311
- Oh, these are just studies.

46:18.345 --> 46:19.312
- Looks just like her.

46:19.346 --> 46:20.213
- Who?

46:20.247 --> 46:22.349
- Come on.

46:22.382 --> 46:23.717
- I'll take it as a compliment.

46:23.750 --> 46:26.286
You can tell it's
her from my drawing.

46:28.923 --> 46:29.756
- Okay.

46:31.993 --> 46:33.393
Let me give you some advice.

46:34.028 --> 46:35.328
Okay?

46:35.362 --> 46:36.196
- Yeah?

46:38.331 --> 46:42.003
- Sammy, if you want to
get a girl like that,

46:42.036 --> 46:43.770
you gotta start
acting like a man.

46:46.273 --> 46:48.275
- Where is this coming from?

46:48.308 --> 46:49.010
- Want the truth?

46:49.043 --> 46:50.377
- Yeah.

46:50.410 --> 46:52.312
- Every day, you're
smoking dope.

46:52.345 --> 46:53.714
You're drawing pictures.

46:53.747 --> 46:56.283
You're working at the Chocolate
Factory, how many years?

46:56.316 --> 46:57.484
- No. Bill, no.

46:57.517 --> 46:58.719
- What?
- No.

46:58.752 --> 47:00.955
You need to learn some
boundaries because-

47:00.988 --> 47:02.023
- What?
- You still talk to me

47:02.056 --> 47:03.490
like I'm a teenager.
- Teenager?

47:03.523 --> 47:04.624
- Yeah.

47:04.658 --> 47:05.826
- In my day,
teenagers were dying

47:05.859 --> 47:07.995
for their country at
17, 18, 19 years of age.

47:08.029 --> 47:08.963
- Are you talking about
the war right now?

47:08.996 --> 47:11.331
- Not to mention the
fact that you're still

47:11.364 --> 47:12.432
living under my roof.
- Okay.

47:12.466 --> 47:13.935
Well not to mention the fact

47:13.968 --> 47:15.368
that I'm living under your roof.

47:15.402 --> 47:16.336
- I just said that.

47:17.637 --> 47:18.505
- Okay.

47:18.538 --> 47:20.440
- What do you mean okay?

47:20.474 --> 47:21.308
What?

47:22.876 --> 47:23.945
- You know what you need?

47:23.978 --> 47:25.345
- What? What do I need?

47:26.413 --> 47:27.581
- You need to get laid.

47:27.614 --> 47:29.282
- Excuse me. What'd
you just say?

47:29.316 --> 47:31.718
- I said you need to get the
old tugboat in the canal.

47:31.752 --> 47:33.453
- See this fork? See that hand?

47:33.487 --> 47:34.956
- Yeah. Alright, alright.

47:34.989 --> 47:35.889
Alright.

47:35.923 --> 47:37.024
- Wanna see what happens?

47:37.058 --> 47:38.558
- No, I'm just
saying, Bill, really.

47:38.592 --> 47:41.328
I haven't seen you up and
dancing like that in years.

47:41.361 --> 47:42.829
- What are you talking about?

47:42.863 --> 47:47.267
- Years. I mean, you looked
like you were having fun.

47:48.202 --> 47:50.403
Why don't you just call
her and ask her out?

47:55.475 --> 47:56.911
- You think I could take her out

47:56.944 --> 47:59.279
after I got drunk and messed
up her daughter's house?

48:01.916 --> 48:03.517
- Maybe she likes bad boys.

48:07.354 --> 48:09.389
- Do you think I have a shot?

48:09.422 --> 48:10.057
- Yeah.

48:11.691 --> 48:13.660
I think she'll be
glad that you called.

48:22.103 --> 48:23.370
Hey, you okay man?

48:23.403 --> 48:24.038
- Fine.

48:26.406 --> 48:27.641
- What's going on, Bill?

48:31.411 --> 48:32.512
- I miss your mother.

48:32.546 --> 48:33.380
- Yeah.

48:34.848 --> 48:35.682
Yeah.

48:37.818 --> 48:39.419
- I'm fine.

48:39.452 --> 48:40.087
Okay.

48:41.923 --> 48:42.756
Thank you.

48:45.159 --> 48:46.359
See this?

48:46.393 --> 48:47.228
- Huh?

48:47.261 --> 48:49.396
- Next time, make
sure it's real pork.

48:49.429 --> 48:50.998
- This is real pork, Bill.

48:51.032 --> 48:53.333
- Like it doesn't have
any MSG either, right?

48:54.501 --> 48:55.937
- I didn't cook it.

48:55.970 --> 48:57.370
I'm glad you're back though.

49:02.843 --> 49:04.644
Hey Mary.
- Hey Sam.

49:05.512 --> 49:06.113
- How are you?

49:06.147 --> 49:07.114
- Good, how are you?

49:07.148 --> 49:08.648
- Good. Good.

49:09.549 --> 49:11.152
I'm glad that we're alone,

49:11.185 --> 49:12.419
'cause I wanted to
see if you wanted

49:12.452 --> 49:13.854
to maybe hang out sometime.

49:13.887 --> 49:14.688
- Okay.

49:14.721 --> 49:15.822
Kate's right over there.

49:15.856 --> 49:17.058
- Hi.

49:17.091 --> 49:17.891
- Hey.

49:17.925 --> 49:18.993
- I got your drawing.

49:19.026 --> 49:20.660
So you're trying to get
me on some roller skates?

49:20.694 --> 49:21.628
Is that what's happening?

49:21.661 --> 49:22.997
- That's what, yeah.

49:23.030 --> 49:24.131
No, but it's,

49:24.165 --> 49:27.134
I should have been more
upfront in the text I sent you.

49:27.168 --> 49:30.037
Tomorrow night, they're
doing this thing at the,

49:30.071 --> 49:33.473
at the roller rink for,
I know it's New Year's.

49:34.774 --> 49:35.609
- Um,

49:41.748 --> 49:44.718
I mean if it could be like a
casual friends skating thing.

49:44.751 --> 49:46.620
- Fully, fully casual.

49:46.653 --> 49:48.055
- Like Mary and Mark could come.

49:48.089 --> 49:49.190
- Please.
- Maybe.

49:49.223 --> 49:50.490
- Yeah. Yeah.
- That would be great.

49:50.523 --> 49:51.424
More the merrier.
- Okay.

49:51.458 --> 49:53.526
- I just meant it like
a fun casual thing.

49:53.560 --> 49:54.861
- Cool, yeah, that would be fun.

49:54.895 --> 49:56.463
- Great. I do feel
a little silly.

49:56.496 --> 49:58.531
I brought chocolates for
you now though. Yeah.

49:58.565 --> 49:59.499
- Oh no, I'll take those.

49:59.532 --> 50:00.600
- Oh yeah. No.
- Thank you.

50:00.634 --> 50:01.902
- Enjoy them.

50:03.004 --> 50:04.804
I'll be back tomorrow
with a corsage.

50:07.074 --> 50:08.675
Yeah. Casual.

50:08.708 --> 50:10.077
Yeah.

50:10.111 --> 50:11.544
- Bye.

50:11.578 --> 50:13.713
- I got a date. I got a date.

50:13.747 --> 50:16.483
I got a date. Hey hey hey hey.

50:16.516 --> 50:17.684
I got a date, I got a date.

50:17.717 --> 50:19.186
- Yeah. Yeah.

50:19.220 --> 50:20.354
Now this,

50:20.388 --> 50:21.521
this is the kind of enthusiasm
I was mentioning earlier.

50:21.554 --> 50:23.523
You know, you can taste it
in every bite, can't you Sam?

50:23.556 --> 50:24.524
- Hey man.

50:24.557 --> 50:25.892
New Year's Eve.

50:25.927 --> 50:27.161
New Year's Eve.

50:27.194 --> 50:29.729
New, new, new, new,
new New Year's Eve.

50:29.763 --> 50:30.597
I got a date.

50:44.577 --> 50:45.578
- Oh.

50:52.186 --> 50:53.354
Hey Bill.

50:53.387 --> 50:57.258
- Oh, Tina, you didn't have
to stand out here in the cold.

50:57.291 --> 50:59.592
- I just came out when
I saw the car lights.

50:59.626 --> 51:02.495
- Well.

51:02.529 --> 51:03.164
You look real nice.

51:03.197 --> 51:06.267
- Thank you. So do you.

51:06.300 --> 51:08.002
- Dude. I'm telling you,

51:08.035 --> 51:11.205
a lot of the most influential
bands just have three members.

51:11.238 --> 51:14.008
Nirvana, Rush, Cream.

51:14.041 --> 51:15.709
- Destiny's Child, TLC.

51:15.742 --> 51:18.511
- TLC! Destiny's Child.
- TLC, yes.

51:18.545 --> 51:19.246
- There's a ton.

51:19.280 --> 51:20.680
Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.

51:20.714 --> 51:22.549
There's tons, dude.
- Love, love them.

51:22.582 --> 51:24.551
- It's the power of three.

51:24.584 --> 51:25.987
Records in the truth.

51:26.020 --> 51:29.622
- But that's the "All Along
the Watchtower" thing.

51:29.656 --> 51:30.557
- Yeah. The U2 Cover.

51:30.590 --> 51:31.691
Yeah. Yeah.

51:31.725 --> 51:33.260
Nice catch.
- Yes, yes.

51:33.294 --> 51:35.129
I'm getting a
musician vibe off you.

51:35.162 --> 51:36.163
- Yeah.

51:36.197 --> 51:37.231
I actually played in
Kate's band a while back.

51:37.264 --> 51:38.199
- No way.

51:38.232 --> 51:38.933
Kate, why didn't you-
- Can we get some beers?

51:38.966 --> 51:40.935
- Yes, beers, yes yes.
- Yes.

51:40.968 --> 51:41.969
- Beers are good.
- Want a beer, dude?

51:42.003 --> 51:43.737
- Hell yeah.
- Right on.

51:43.770 --> 51:45.572
- I'm gonna check
out the skates.

51:46.573 --> 51:48.575
I'll be out here.

51:48.608 --> 51:50.044
- Is she okay?

51:50.077 --> 51:51.278
- Yeah, she just doesn't really

51:51.312 --> 51:53.680
like talking about
her music anymore.

51:53.713 --> 51:54.848
Just go skate with her.

52:26.713 --> 52:31.584

52:31.618 --> 52:34.587
suggested I call you
up and ask you out,

52:34.621 --> 52:36.157
if truth be known.
- Did he?

52:36.190 --> 52:37.058
- Yeah.

52:37.091 --> 52:38.591
- That's so funny.

52:38.625 --> 52:40.127
Katie did the same thing.

52:41.128 --> 52:42.595
They're in cahoots.

52:42.629 --> 52:43.563
- I was just thinking,

52:43.596 --> 52:45.665
I wonder if they talked
it over between them.

52:45.698 --> 52:46.900
- I'm glad they did, though.

52:48.335 --> 52:50.870
It's been a long time since
I've been out like this.

52:50.905 --> 52:52.705

52:52.739 --> 52:53.908
Do you mind if I
take my coat off?

52:53.941 --> 52:55.242
- Oh, of course.

52:55.276 --> 52:57.677
- I don't know whether
it's hot in here,

52:57.710 --> 53:01.348
or I'm having hot
flashes 'cause of you.

53:01.382 --> 53:04.717
- Oh, well.

53:04.751 --> 53:06.320
You don't think they'll
mind if I take these.

53:06.353 --> 53:07.388
I need 'em for my
coffee tomorrow.

53:07.421 --> 53:08.989
- No, no, go.

53:09.023 --> 53:09.856
So,

53:12.826 --> 53:15.129
you have a lovely daughter.

53:15.162 --> 53:16.629
- Thank you.

53:16.663 --> 53:17.897
- And I'm just curious,

53:17.932 --> 53:19.833
is her father,

53:19.866 --> 53:22.702
I mean, if I'm talking
out of line here-

53:22.735 --> 53:23.636
- No no, no.

53:27.241 --> 53:29.776
He left when she
was just a baby.

53:32.446 --> 53:34.315
There was a note.

53:34.348 --> 53:36.783
I think I burned it
in the fireplace.

53:36.816 --> 53:37.650
- What an idiot.

53:38.751 --> 53:40.753
- I never heard from him again.

53:40.787 --> 53:41.388
- Never?

53:41.422 --> 53:43.090
- Never.

53:43.124 --> 53:45.758
- Well, he doesn't
know what he's missing.

53:45.792 --> 53:46.626
- No.

53:47.660 --> 53:51.332
And he's the dumbass that
missed out on Katie's life.

53:53.867 --> 53:55.902
Lucky me. Lucky me.

54:00.374 --> 54:02.409
- Katie, you know, you were
really something out there.

54:02.443 --> 54:03.710
- Me?
- Oh yeah.

54:03.743 --> 54:04.711
- Mm-hmm, oh yeah.
- Yeah.

54:04.744 --> 54:07.081
Almost as good as Mary.

54:07.114 --> 54:08.249
Not quite as good.
- Oh.

54:08.282 --> 54:10.417
- Oh wow, okay, alright.
- Okay.

54:10.451 --> 54:11.818
- But she had a better partner.

54:11.851 --> 54:13.254
- Oh, thank you, bro.

54:13.287 --> 54:14.687
- I don't know, I
thought my partner

54:14.721 --> 54:16.190
was really moving
his hips out there.

54:16.223 --> 54:17.324
- Oh yeah, we saw the hips.

54:17.358 --> 54:18.725
- Yeah brother,

54:18.758 --> 54:20.261
those hips don't lie.
- We saw the hips.

54:20.294 --> 54:21.362
- Alright skaters,

54:21.395 --> 54:22.762
grab your partners.

54:22.795 --> 54:24.731
It's the last couples
skate of the year.

54:24.764 --> 54:27.067
Last couples skate
before New Year's.

54:27.101 --> 54:31.405
Grab your partners for the
last skate of the year.

- He certainly was never
gonna go into the service.

55:11.312 --> 55:14.781
But from the age of four,
he started sketching.

55:14.814 --> 55:18.352
And I'm telling you, he could
sketch right from the get-go,

55:18.385 --> 55:19.486
without any lessons.

55:19.520 --> 55:20.955
- Yeah.
- Anyway,

55:20.988 --> 55:24.757
when June was back
in the hospital

55:24.791 --> 55:27.361
'cause she was
battling cancer again,

55:28.828 --> 55:30.264
Sammy and I visited
her every day.

55:30.297 --> 55:31.999
Sammy sometimes
was there all day.

55:33.200 --> 55:34.401
And he said to me
one time, he says,

55:34.435 --> 55:37.371
"Daddy, why is it that
some of these other

55:37.404 --> 55:39.772
cancer patients
don't have visitors?"

55:39.806 --> 55:41.008
And they didn't.

55:41.041 --> 55:42.809
And I didn't know
what to say to him.

55:43.876 --> 55:45.246
Without me knowing it,

55:45.279 --> 55:47.214
he went over, and
without them knowing it,

55:47.248 --> 55:49.516
he started to sketch
each one of the ones

55:49.550 --> 55:51.218
that never had any visitors.

55:52.386 --> 55:56.323
And he gave each
of them a picture.

55:56.357 --> 55:58.858
I said, "Why'd you
do that, Sammy?"

55:58.891 --> 56:01.061
He says, "I just thought
it would, you know,

56:01.095 --> 56:02.762
make 'em a little happier."

56:03.863 --> 56:04.531
That's Sammy.

56:06.233 --> 56:08.936
He's a better man than me.

56:08.969 --> 56:12.072
Better man than I am right now.

56:13.941 --> 56:16.944
- Well, you're not so bad.

56:22.016 --> 56:23.317
- I don't know about that.

56:25.386 --> 56:28.289
- Let's just not worry
about anything for a minute,

56:28.322 --> 56:33.193
and finish that dance
that we started.

56:34.595 --> 56:35.429
Okay?

56:49.977 --> 56:51.011
- What?

56:51.045 --> 56:53.013
- You're not dancing.

56:53.047 --> 56:56.216
- Can we just stand
here for a moment?

57:09.596 --> 57:10.431
- Wow.

57:11.565 --> 57:14.201
They're really
going for it, huh?

57:16.437 --> 57:17.271
Awesome.

57:26.547 --> 57:27.981
Happy New Year.

57:29.683 --> 57:31.085
How's that song go?

57:31.118 --> 57:35.022
It's like, doo doo
do doo doo doo.

57:35.055 --> 57:36.290
You know that?

57:36.323 --> 57:37.524
- No.

57:37.558 --> 57:38.158
- I'm just trying
to get you to sing.

57:38.192 --> 57:39.026
- Oh.

57:39.693 --> 57:41.962
No, it's not gonna happen.

57:43.063 --> 57:44.298
- I hope it does someday.

57:49.103 --> 57:51.138
So do you have any New
Year's resolutions?

57:51.171 --> 57:52.439
That's such a dorky question.
- No,

57:52.473 --> 57:54.575
that's not a dorky question.

57:54.608 --> 57:55.442
Um,

57:57.578 --> 57:59.980
yeah, I don't know.

58:00.013 --> 58:01.215
- I like New Year's, though.

58:02.683 --> 58:04.918
Some people always think
I'm weird for saying this,

58:04.952 --> 58:06.420
but it's actually
my favorite holiday.

58:06.453 --> 58:07.388
- Same.

58:07.421 --> 58:08.155
- Really?
- Yeah.

58:08.188 --> 58:09.022
- How come?

58:10.157 --> 58:11.959
- It's like a clean
slate, you know?

58:12.626 --> 58:14.128
You can start fresh.

58:14.161 --> 58:16.530
- Yeah, yeah, I get that.

58:16.563 --> 58:19.967
I usually think of
like a fresh notebook.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.336
- Mm, yeah, exactly.
- Yeah.

58:22.369 --> 58:23.270
- Except you're just saying that

58:23.303 --> 58:24.438
'cause you sell the notebooks.

59:13.120 --> 59:14.221
- Oh!

59:14.254 --> 59:16.457
- Happy New Year, Bill.

59:16.490 --> 59:18.392
- Happy New Year, Tina.

59:36.043 --> 59:37.544
You look really nice.

59:37.578 --> 59:38.579
- Thank you.

59:39.613 --> 59:42.149
- So, how about a night cap?

59:42.783 --> 59:46.787
- Oh, I'm not so sure.

59:46.820 --> 59:47.654
- Why?

59:47.688 --> 59:48.689
- I don't know.

59:48.722 --> 59:49.690
I just...

59:51.592 --> 59:52.793
- Huh?

59:52.826 --> 59:57.130
- I haven't had anyone
over in so long.

59:57.164 --> 59:58.765
- Well, I haven't
been out in so long.

1:00:00.167 --> 1:00:01.635
- I tell you what.
- What?

1:00:01.668 --> 1:00:03.437
- You wait here.
- Yeah?

1:00:03.470 --> 1:00:05.105
- And I'll go into the house,

1:00:05.138 --> 1:00:08.675
and bring out some drinks.

1:00:08.709 --> 1:00:11.144
And we can have a
night cap on the porch.

1:00:11.178 --> 1:00:12.179
- But it's a little chilly.

1:00:12.212 --> 1:00:14.581
- Well, I'll bring blankets.

1:00:14.615 --> 1:00:16.250
It'll be super cozy.

1:00:17.518 --> 1:00:19.353
- Well, I may need one more kiss

1:00:19.386 --> 1:00:21.622
just to keep warm
until you get back.

1:00:30.097 --> 1:00:31.231
- Well you wait right here.

1:00:31.265 --> 1:00:32.099
- Okay.

1:00:36.803 --> 1:00:39.072
- Thank you for walking me home.

1:00:39.106 --> 1:00:40.040
- Yeah, of course.

1:00:40.841 --> 1:00:41.842
I kinda wish we
stole the skates.

1:00:41.875 --> 1:00:43.076
We could've skated home.

1:00:45.846 --> 1:00:47.381
- Happy New Year.

1:00:47.414 --> 1:00:49.283
- Yeah, Happy New Year.

1:00:51.618 --> 1:00:52.419
- Yeah.

1:01:02.796 --> 1:01:04.331
- Okay.
- Okay.

1:01:04.364 --> 1:01:06.433
Okay, I should go.
- Yeah.

1:01:07.367 --> 1:01:12.372
- I should...

1:01:27.721 --> 1:01:28.522
- Tina?

1:01:39.934 --> 1:01:41.168
Tina.

1:01:44.237 --> 1:01:45.238
Tina.

1:01:48.175 --> 1:01:49.176
Jesus.

1:02:15.502 --> 1:02:16.336
- Bill?

1:02:58.845 --> 1:02:59.746
- You okay?

1:03:01.648 --> 1:03:03.283
- Yeah.

1:03:03.316 --> 1:03:03.951
- Did I,

1:03:05.519 --> 1:03:07.521
did I do something wrong?

1:03:07.554 --> 1:03:08.388
- No.

1:03:10.524 --> 1:03:12.325
- Did I do something so right

1:03:12.359 --> 1:03:13.560
that you're just like,

1:03:13.593 --> 1:03:15.896
overwhelmed with
emotion right now?

1:03:15.930 --> 1:03:17.631
- Yeah, kind of.

1:03:17.664 --> 1:03:18.498
- Really?

1:03:19.466 --> 1:03:20.434
- I mean-

1:03:20.467 --> 1:03:21.601
- It'd be a lot cooler

1:03:21.635 --> 1:03:22.536

surprised right now.

He's actually using the
gardening stuff I got him.

1:03:48.862 --> 1:03:50.297
- Is that odd?

1:03:50.330 --> 1:03:51.732
- Maybe it's a New
Year's resolution.

1:03:53.935 --> 1:03:55.836
Thank you for the ride.

1:03:55.869 --> 1:03:57.471
I'll fax you?

1:03:57.504 --> 1:04:00.841
- Okay.

1:04:00.874 --> 1:04:02.309
Or should I say hi?

1:04:02.342 --> 1:04:03.044
- Yeah yeah, say hi to Bill.

1:04:03.077 --> 1:04:04.344
He'd love to see you.

1:04:09.716 --> 1:04:10.650
- Hey Bill.

1:04:13.520 --> 1:04:14.654
Car's working great.

1:04:23.897 --> 1:04:25.066
Bye, Sam.

1:04:25.099 --> 1:04:25.933
Bye, Bill.

1:04:31.038 --> 1:04:31.872
- Hey Bill.

1:04:33.373 --> 1:04:35.776
- Did you have a good
time with her there?

1:04:35.809 --> 1:04:37.979
- Yeah, yeah, I really did.

1:04:38.012 --> 1:04:40.347
You didn't feel like saying hi?

1:04:42.382 --> 1:04:43.951
- Did you lay with her?

1:04:43.985 --> 1:04:44.785
- What?

1:04:44.818 --> 1:04:45.619
- Did you lay with her?

1:04:45.652 --> 1:04:46.988
Did you get lucky?

1:04:47.021 --> 1:04:47.922
- You're kidding, right?

1:04:47.955 --> 1:04:48.755
- No.

1:04:48.789 --> 1:04:50.390
Actually, I'm not.

1:04:50.423 --> 1:04:52.927
- Okay, Bill, I don't know
where this is coming from.

1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:55.362
- Well, I gotta
tell you something.

1:04:55.395 --> 1:04:56.396
I thought you were a gentleman.

1:04:56.429 --> 1:04:57.564
- What?

1:04:57.597 --> 1:04:58.799
- And you're not a gentleman.

1:04:58.832 --> 1:05:00.567
- What the hell are
you talking about?

1:05:01.501 --> 1:05:03.403
- I thought you were
somebody that I raised,

1:05:03.436 --> 1:05:04.337
and you're not that person.

1:05:04.371 --> 1:05:05.472
I can use some water.

1:05:05.505 --> 1:05:07.507
- Oh my God.
- Get me some water.

1:05:07.541 --> 1:05:08.375
- Yeah, okay.

1:05:18.119 --> 1:05:19.352
- Water, please.

1:05:21.388 --> 1:05:22.190
- You know what
you just said to me

1:05:22.223 --> 1:05:23.523
was a terrible
thing to say, right?

1:05:23.557 --> 1:05:24.791
- Yeah.
- You do know that?

1:05:24.825 --> 1:05:25.725
- Yeah, do you know-

1:05:25.759 --> 1:05:26.961
- I'm not who you thought I was?

1:05:26.994 --> 1:05:28.395
Why would you say
something like that?

1:05:28.428 --> 1:05:30.131
- Well she's not who you
thought that she was.

1:05:30.164 --> 1:05:31.464
- What?
- You don't just

1:05:31.498 --> 1:05:32.432
stick it in her the first date.

1:05:32.465 --> 1:05:33.968
- You have no idea what
you're talking about.

1:05:34.001 --> 1:05:34.801
- She's not a bimbo.
- You don't know

1:05:34.835 --> 1:05:35.635
what happened.

1:05:35.669 --> 1:05:36.736
You weren't there.

1:05:36.770 --> 1:05:37.737
You weren't there!
- Yeah.

1:05:37.771 --> 1:05:39.140
You've been into
casual sex, too.

1:05:39.173 --> 1:05:39.941
- You weren't there!
- I don't have to be there.

1:05:39.974 --> 1:05:41.541
You're just a
fucking stick-it-in-

1:05:43.978 --> 1:05:45.445
- Hey, hey, sorry.

1:05:45.478 --> 1:05:46.813
Wait, Bill, Bill.

1:05:59.927 --> 1:06:01.595
- More atrial fib
than last time.

1:06:03.164 --> 1:06:05.432
I've sent your information
and your blood work

1:06:05.465 --> 1:06:08.468
over to a colleague of
mine at Wells Hospital.

1:06:09.603 --> 1:06:10.837
Trying to get a
little more clarity.

1:06:10.871 --> 1:06:12.439
Here's a Life Alert
I want you to wear.

1:06:12.472 --> 1:06:13.174
Now come on, Bill.

1:06:13.207 --> 1:06:14.175
You know you need to wear it.

1:06:14.208 --> 1:06:16.010
- You wear it.

1:06:16.043 --> 1:06:17.644
- We can keep him here
for monitoring overnight.

1:06:17.677 --> 1:06:18.879
- Hey, no no no.

1:06:20.513 --> 1:06:24.085
I'm out of here.

1:06:24.118 --> 1:06:25.485
- Thanks, Doc.

1:07:01.821 --> 1:07:03.790
- You know, he didn't
even used to smoke cigars?

1:07:03.823 --> 1:07:07.028
He literally started when
the doctor told him not to.

1:07:07.061 --> 1:07:07.995
- That's funny.

1:07:08.029 --> 1:07:10.031
- Yeah, I just wish he cared.

1:07:10.064 --> 1:07:13.200
- Yeah.

1:07:20.573 --> 1:07:21.741
- Wait, don't move your eyes.

1:07:21.775 --> 1:07:22.676
I'm doing the eyelashes.

1:07:22.709 --> 1:07:24.211
- Ugh, I have to take this.

1:07:24.245 --> 1:07:25.645
I'm gonna move.

1:07:25.679 --> 1:07:26.846
- Okay, but-
- You good? Okay.

1:07:26.880 --> 1:07:28.481
- You might turn out abstract.
- Hey mom.

1:07:29.783 --> 1:07:31.252
Wait, wait, slow down.

1:07:31.285 --> 1:07:32.719
What?

1:07:32.752 --> 1:07:34.554
Oh God, mom, really?

1:07:38.192 --> 1:07:39.026
How do you-

1:07:40.227 --> 1:07:42.229
No, I don't think he
would've done that.

1:07:45.166 --> 1:07:46.566
Well, they're not
gonna come right now,

1:07:46.599 --> 1:07:48.735
so maybe I'll come
by in a little bit,

1:07:48.768 --> 1:07:49.937
and we can make a plan.

1:07:51.638 --> 1:07:52.572
Okay?

1:07:52.605 --> 1:07:53.240
I love you.

1:07:54.574 --> 1:07:55.209
Bye.

1:08:02.316 --> 1:08:04.151
- That's not at
all how you were.

1:08:08.588 --> 1:08:09.589
Is everything okay?

1:08:09.622 --> 1:08:10.657
- Yeah.

1:08:12.659 --> 1:08:13.660
No, I don't know.

1:08:15.695 --> 1:08:18.865
Did your dad tell you what
happened the other night?

1:08:20.201 --> 1:08:21.801
You know he took my mom out

1:08:21.835 --> 1:08:22.937
for like a New Year's date.

1:08:22.970 --> 1:08:24.171
- No way.

1:08:24.205 --> 1:08:25.739
I was encouraging
him to do that.

1:08:25.772 --> 1:08:27.074
I didn't think he really would.

1:08:27.108 --> 1:08:28.608
- Well, it didn't end well.

1:08:28.641 --> 1:08:29.276
- What happened?

1:08:30.677 --> 1:08:32.612
- He left, abruptly.

1:08:32.645 --> 1:08:35.182
And they haven't spoken.

1:08:35.216 --> 1:08:36.649
- Damn it, Bill.

1:08:36.683 --> 1:08:40.787
- In his defense, it's a
lot for anyone to take.

1:08:40.820 --> 1:08:41.788
- What do you mean?

1:08:48.728 --> 1:08:50.197
- My mom, um,

1:08:52.299 --> 1:08:54.768
well, she would call
herself a collector.

1:08:57.637 --> 1:08:59.873
But she's like, a hoarder.

1:08:59.907 --> 1:09:01.841
She's a full-on hoarder.

1:09:01.875 --> 1:09:04.945
Like her house is totally,
totally full of shit.

1:09:06.047 --> 1:09:06.880
- I'm sorry.

1:09:08.782 --> 1:09:09.616
- Anyway,

1:09:10.351 --> 1:09:11.851
I guess her house got,

1:09:14.255 --> 1:09:16.689
I don't know, someone like
called it in to the city,

1:09:16.723 --> 1:09:18.792
and I mean, this
has happened before.

1:09:19.994 --> 1:09:21.929
And she has to, we
have to clean it,

1:09:21.962 --> 1:09:24.798
clean it up, or she won't
be able to live there.

1:09:26.267 --> 1:09:28.269
And then she'll have to like
live with me, or something.

1:09:29.869 --> 1:09:31.105
- You don't want to
live with your mom?

1:09:31.138 --> 1:09:33.640
- I don't want to
live with my mom.

1:09:33.673 --> 1:09:34.909
- We could trade.

1:09:34.942 --> 1:09:36.377
You could live with
Bill, I could live-

1:09:36.410 --> 1:09:38.979
Is it too soon for me to
move in with your mom?

1:09:42.149 --> 1:09:43.050
Well, let me help.

1:09:44.418 --> 1:09:46.853
I mean, like, moving stuff.

1:09:48.055 --> 1:09:49.990
- Yeah, that would
be really nice.

1:09:50.024 --> 1:09:50.857
Thank you.

1:09:54.095 --> 1:09:54.929
Hey mom.

1:10:01.035 --> 1:10:02.036
Mom, you know the routine.

1:10:04.771 --> 1:10:06.639
- I didn't know you
were bringing Sam.

1:10:06.673 --> 1:10:07.908
- Well, we're gonna
need his help.

1:10:07.942 --> 1:10:10.777
And I also got that
company from last time.

1:10:29.463 --> 1:10:31.798
- Wow, so many
treasures in here.

1:10:33.200 --> 1:10:35.936
- I invited someone, too.

1:10:37.438 --> 1:10:40.040
Her name is Beth and she,

1:10:40.074 --> 1:10:41.741
she's in the choir.

1:10:41.774 --> 1:10:43.344
I know a little secret of hers,

1:10:43.377 --> 1:10:46.380
so she can't really tell
anybody at church about mine.

1:10:51.485 --> 1:10:52.685
Oh well.

1:10:55.122 --> 1:10:57.258
A little energy boost.

1:10:57.291 --> 1:10:58.993
For the job.
- Thank you, Tina.

1:11:00.261 --> 1:11:01.462
Bless your heart.

1:11:01.495 --> 1:11:03.863
I think I understand now
why you have insomnia.

1:11:06.066 --> 1:11:09.336
- Um, okay, so, I
brought some gloves.

1:11:09.370 --> 1:11:10.971
And I have a company coming

1:11:11.005 --> 1:11:13.007
to bring oversized trash bins.

1:11:13.040 --> 1:11:16.676
Mom is gonna help us to organize
things into boxes, what-

1:11:18.946 --> 1:11:19.779
Mom.

1:11:23.217 --> 1:11:24.451
- Well.
- We're dating.

1:11:25.519 --> 1:11:27.787
- Oh, how nice.

1:11:45.872 --> 1:11:46.941
- This is so embarrassing.

1:11:50.477 --> 1:11:52.779
- Oh, just a minute.

1:11:52.812 --> 1:11:54.814
Oh, and I've changed my mind.

1:11:54.847 --> 1:11:57.251
This chain goes to my bicycle.

1:11:57.284 --> 1:11:58.986
- That you can't find,
and that is broken.

1:11:59.019 --> 1:12:00.354
It's broken, mom.

1:12:00.387 --> 1:12:02.289
If we're ever gonna
get this house cleaned,

1:12:02.323 --> 1:12:04.757
you're gonna have to start
getting rid of some things.

1:12:04.791 --> 1:12:05.926
- I know.
- Okay?

1:12:05.960 --> 1:12:07.528
- I know, I'm not an idiot.

1:12:07.561 --> 1:12:08.861
- Okay, here you go.

1:12:08.895 --> 1:12:09.496
Thank you so much.

1:12:09.530 --> 1:12:10.763
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:12:12.299 --> 1:12:13.133
- Mom.

1:12:50.971 --> 1:12:52.439
- Thank you so much for coming.

1:12:52.473 --> 1:12:53.941
- Oh, sure.

1:12:53.974 --> 1:12:55.943
- I don't know if I should
say something or not.

1:12:56.744 --> 1:12:59.380
- Well, wait, did she
tell you this, bro?

1:12:59.413 --> 1:13:00.813
- No, that's what I'm saying.

1:13:00.847 --> 1:13:02.149
I saw a picture
and I called you.

1:13:02.182 --> 1:13:03.550
She doesn't even
know that I know.

1:13:03.584 --> 1:13:05.219
And I don't even
know what I know.

1:13:05.252 --> 1:13:09.456
I saw a picture of her
with her family, I guess.

1:13:10.624 --> 1:13:11.992
- Wait.

1:13:12.026 --> 1:13:13.527
That's so bizarre.

1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:17.298
But you don't know for
sure that she has a family.

1:13:17.331 --> 1:13:18.465
You saw a picture.

1:13:18.499 --> 1:13:19.866
- That's true, it could
not be her family,

1:13:19.899 --> 1:13:21.335
but there's multiple
pictures of her

1:13:21.368 --> 1:13:23.137
and some dude and a baby.

1:13:23.170 --> 1:13:24.004
I mean.

1:13:25.105 --> 1:13:26.907
- Oh shit, put this out.

1:13:30.444 --> 1:13:31.278
- Give me that.

1:13:33.180 --> 1:13:34.014
Now!

1:13:42.556 --> 1:13:43.957
- Oh, you...

1:13:45.626 --> 1:13:48.228
That's really, really strong.

1:13:50.631 --> 1:13:52.865
I think you're gonna
need my help, ma'am.

1:13:53.667 --> 1:13:55.469
- Did you see all the TVs?

1:13:56.437 --> 1:13:57.371
- You think that one works?

1:13:57.404 --> 1:13:58.871
- I mean, either way, it's cool.

1:13:58.906 --> 1:13:59.907
- Yeah.

1:14:00.974 --> 1:14:02.209
Oh hey, Beth.

1:14:02.242 --> 1:14:04.144
Right on, you cleaning
out the fridge?

1:14:06.180 --> 1:14:07.948
Good.

1:14:07.981 --> 1:14:09.350
- Beth.

1:14:09.383 --> 1:14:10.951
What are you doing?

1:14:10.984 --> 1:14:14.188
- Oh, I was just checking
expiration dates.

1:14:14.221 --> 1:14:16.056
- The expiration
dates mean nothing,

1:14:16.090 --> 1:14:18.025
so put it back and
get out of my fridge.

1:14:18.058 --> 1:14:19.226
- Oh, okay.

1:14:19.259 --> 1:14:20.994
I am so sorry.

1:14:30.437 --> 1:14:31.271
- You too.

1:15:04.171 --> 1:15:05.973
- Just really,

1:15:06.006 --> 1:15:07.040
I can't do this anymore.

1:15:07.074 --> 1:15:09.309
I just can't do this anymore.
- Beth, are you okay?

1:15:09.343 --> 1:15:12.012
- Oh, I can't do this anymore.

1:15:12.045 --> 1:15:13.714
- Well, that's okay
if you need to go.

1:15:13.747 --> 1:15:15.115
I understand.

1:15:15.149 --> 1:15:17.384
- I don't think your
mom's gonna understand.

1:15:17.418 --> 1:15:18.519
- Probably not.

1:15:18.552 --> 1:15:19.386
- No.

1:15:21.021 --> 1:15:23.157
- Beth?
- Oh, Tina.

1:15:23.190 --> 1:15:25.259
I am so sorry, but
I've done everything

1:15:25.292 --> 1:15:26.093
that I can do here,

1:15:26.126 --> 1:15:28.529
so I'm gonna have to go,

1:15:28.562 --> 1:15:31.331
and I promise
I won't tell anybody.

1:15:31.365 --> 1:15:32.199
- Good.

1:15:32.232 --> 1:15:33.967
Goodbye!

1:15:34.001 --> 1:15:35.269
Bye.

1:15:35.302 --> 1:15:36.236
Don't come back.

1:15:38.071 --> 1:15:38.972
She's stoned.

1:15:39.006 --> 1:15:40.674
- What?
- Yeah, she smoked.

1:15:40.707 --> 1:15:43.110
She's been smoking,
somebody got her high.

1:15:43.143 --> 1:15:46.046
- That's awesome, that's real?
- Yeah, yeah it's real.

1:15:50.017 --> 1:15:51.585
- Where'd you get that?

1:15:51.618 --> 1:15:54.087
- Oh, oh I'm Ron.

1:15:54.121 --> 1:15:56.223
I'm from Texas.

1:15:56.256 --> 1:15:58.559
I'm a friend of Sam's.

1:15:58.592 --> 1:16:00.360
- I'm Tina, this is Kate.

1:16:02.095 --> 1:16:05.199
And that's my goose,
and it's a keep!

1:16:08.235 --> 1:16:09.136
Okay, everybody get
out of the house.

1:16:09.169 --> 1:16:11.004
Everybody with an orange shirt,

1:16:11.038 --> 1:16:13.440
get out of my fucking house!

1:16:13.474 --> 1:16:17.244
- I'm gonna go...
- You hear me?!

1:16:17.277 --> 1:16:18.545
- Are you high?

1:16:18.579 --> 1:16:19.680
Did you get her high?

1:16:19.713 --> 1:16:21.748
- Well, I mean, we didn't
convince her, or anything.

1:16:21.782 --> 1:16:24.685
- It was a bit more
complicated than...

1:16:24.718 --> 1:16:27.154
- Awesome, okay, you can go.

1:16:27.187 --> 1:16:28.622
You can go, too.

1:16:28.655 --> 1:16:32.392
- I'm just gonna make sure
Beth gets home safely.

1:16:32.426 --> 1:16:33.760
- I was trying to help.

1:16:33.794 --> 1:16:34.561
- Alright, you want to help?

1:16:34.595 --> 1:16:36.697
Why don't you take
the donate box

1:16:36.730 --> 1:16:39.299
from the ironing board thing?

1:16:39.333 --> 1:16:40.601
Just the donate box.

1:16:41.668 --> 1:16:43.737
Please and thank you.
- Okay, okay.

1:16:51.178 --> 1:16:52.012
- Mom.

1:16:53.580 --> 1:16:54.781
Mom, open the door.

1:16:54.815 --> 1:16:58.151
- No, it's too much,
Katie, I can't do it.

1:16:58.185 --> 1:16:59.520
- You can do it.

1:16:59.553 --> 1:17:02.155
We've been here before.
- I know!

1:17:02.189 --> 1:17:04.658
I live with this
every damn day, Katie.

1:17:06.126 --> 1:17:08.629
I deal with it every damn day.

1:17:08.662 --> 1:17:11.131
I just can't, I can't.

1:17:11.164 --> 1:17:13.233
Just, just take it all.

1:17:13.267 --> 1:17:15.168
Just, just,

1:17:16.470 --> 1:17:18.071
just throw it all away.

1:17:18.105 --> 1:17:20.173
I don't give a shit anymore.

1:17:23.577 --> 1:17:24.745
- Are you smoking?

1:17:24.778 --> 1:17:27.147
- Oh, you want to take
that from me, too?

1:17:27.180 --> 1:17:28.615
Fine!

1:17:28.649 --> 1:17:30.117
Just take everything!

1:17:32.352 --> 1:17:34.821
I'll just die here alone.

1:17:34.855 --> 1:17:36.189
Everybody will be happy.

1:17:38.892 --> 1:17:39.726
- Mom.

1:17:41.161 --> 1:17:42.095
I love you.

1:17:44.364 --> 1:17:45.766
You're all I got.

1:18:48.862 --> 1:18:49.931
- Let me tell you, man.

1:18:49.964 --> 1:18:51.732
It's about job security.

1:18:51.765 --> 1:18:56.436
Because machines are never
gonna replace baristas.

1:18:56.470 --> 1:18:57.904
And my cousin owns
the shop already,

1:18:57.939 --> 1:19:00.574
so I'm practically
a manager there.

1:19:00.607 --> 1:19:02.709
We could put your
artwork up on the walls.

1:19:03.810 --> 1:19:05.212
Hey Sam, are you okay, buddy?

1:19:05.245 --> 1:19:07.748
I said we could get your
artwork up on the walls.

1:19:08.749 --> 1:19:10.283
- That's,

1:19:10.317 --> 1:19:11.485
that'd be,

1:19:11.518 --> 1:19:12.619
that'd really be something.

1:19:12.653 --> 1:19:15.322
I just, sorry man.

1:19:15.355 --> 1:19:17.658
I can't stop thinking
about this guy's face

1:19:17.691 --> 1:19:18.492
in the picture.

1:19:18.525 --> 1:19:20.260
I just don't understand.

1:19:20.293 --> 1:19:22.930
I'm so confused.

1:19:23.864 --> 1:19:25.265
- Right, well.

1:19:26.566 --> 1:19:29.236
If it's about her ex,
or her other life,

1:19:29.269 --> 1:19:30.504
and all that stuff,

1:19:30.537 --> 1:19:31.738
I mean, she's gonna
tell you about that

1:19:31.772 --> 1:19:32.873
when she's ready.
- Ron, we don't know

1:19:32.907 --> 1:19:33.840
that it's her ex, though.

1:19:33.874 --> 1:19:34.942
We're assuming that.

1:19:34.976 --> 1:19:38.478
For all we know, she could
still be with this guy.

1:19:38.512 --> 1:19:39.947
I could be the guy on the side.

1:19:39.981 --> 1:19:41.415
- Some guys like that.

1:19:41.448 --> 1:19:42.282
- Not me.

1:19:45.686 --> 1:19:48.355
- Let me tell you
something about love, Sam.

1:19:48.388 --> 1:19:52.359
And what springs to mind is
my favorite quote from Rilke,

1:19:52.392 --> 1:19:53.493
which is,

1:19:53.527 --> 1:19:56.363
"Each partner chooses the other

1:19:57.564 --> 1:19:58.899
to be the guardian
of his solitude."

1:19:58.933 --> 1:19:59.733
- Wait.

1:19:59.766 --> 1:20:00.968
- Ride-

1:20:01.002 --> 1:20:03.203
- It's Kate, it's Kate,
it's Kate, it's Kate.

1:20:05.006 --> 1:20:06.840
Hey, hey Kate, what's up?

1:20:06.873 --> 1:20:07.774
- You took the wrong box.

1:20:07.808 --> 1:20:08.875
Did you donate it already?

1:20:08.910 --> 1:20:10.310
- What?

1:20:10.343 --> 1:20:11.411
- Did you donate the
box that you took?

1:20:11.445 --> 1:20:13.280
You took the wrong box.

1:20:13.313 --> 1:20:14.982
- Well, I mean, it was
one of those, like,

1:20:15.016 --> 1:20:16.450
drop box centers.

1:20:16.483 --> 1:20:18.719
I don't even, I just
put it through the-

1:20:18.752 --> 1:20:19.954
- Can you get it back?

1:20:19.987 --> 1:20:20.854
Can you go see if
you can get it back?

1:20:20.887 --> 1:20:22.322
- Right, but I'm saying,

1:20:22.355 --> 1:20:23.523
I don't even know
if anyone's there.

1:20:23.557 --> 1:20:24.858
I can go check,

1:20:24.891 --> 1:20:26.560
but your mom has a lot of stuff.

1:20:26.593 --> 1:20:28.261
You think she'll even notice?

1:20:28.295 --> 1:20:30.597
- I had a bunch of
my son's stuff in it.

1:20:30.630 --> 1:20:31.732
Shit.

1:20:31.765 --> 1:20:33.467
- So you do have a son.

1:20:34.568 --> 1:20:37.304
I actually saw a photo,

1:20:37.337 --> 1:20:41.308
or a few photos at
the house, and of you,

1:20:41.341 --> 1:20:44.478
and I guessed your
son and ex-husband,

1:20:44.511 --> 1:20:48.381
and I don't want to pry on
your past relationships,

1:20:48.415 --> 1:20:49.883
but I wish you would have been

1:20:49.917 --> 1:20:52.053
a little more upfront with
me about having a kid,

1:20:52.086 --> 1:20:54.287
because-
- Okay, shush.

1:20:57.390 --> 1:20:57.992
- Kate?

1:20:59.693 --> 1:21:00.894
Are you okay?

1:21:04.431 --> 1:21:05.832
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

1:21:10.104 --> 1:21:11.906
- Yeah, they died.

1:21:15.809 --> 1:21:16.676
In a car wreck.

1:21:29.123 --> 1:21:33.393
- Kate, I'm so sorry.

1:21:33.426 --> 1:21:34.461
Hello?

1:22:10.397 --> 1:22:12.766
- It might be, did
you look over there?

1:22:12.799 --> 1:22:14.467
Where is it, Sammy?

1:22:14.501 --> 1:22:16.037
Oh, thanks.

1:22:16.070 --> 1:22:17.404
- Your
call has been forwarded

1:22:17.437 --> 1:22:19.506
to an automated
voice message system.

1:22:20.308 --> 1:22:22.409
At the tone, please
record your message.

1:22:23.177 --> 1:22:24.377
- Hey Kate, it's me again.

1:22:24.411 --> 1:22:25.279
I just wanted to let you know

1:22:25.313 --> 1:22:27.148
I called the number
on the donation box,

1:22:27.181 --> 1:22:28.782
but they couldn't track it down.

1:22:30.151 --> 1:22:32.619
So I went to all the
donation centers in town,

1:22:32.652 --> 1:22:34.088
and I'm gonna keep looking.

1:22:34.121 --> 1:22:36.389
I'm not giving up until-

1:22:36.423 --> 1:22:38.592
until we, shit!

1:22:44.831 --> 1:22:45.732
- What are you doing?

1:22:45.765 --> 1:22:47.068
You know I like scrambled eggs.

1:22:47.101 --> 1:22:48.501
I hate oatmeal.

1:22:48.535 --> 1:22:49.636
- Oatmeal is good
for your heart.

1:22:49.669 --> 1:22:51.005
Why didn't you tell me you
went on a date with Tina?

1:22:51.038 --> 1:22:52.505
- Didn't know I had to.

1:22:52.539 --> 1:22:53.341
- Well, do you think
you could've handled

1:22:53.373 --> 1:22:54.976
the situation a bit
more delicately?

1:22:55.009 --> 1:22:56.877
- What situation?
- What situation?

1:22:56.911 --> 1:22:58.079
- Yeah.

1:22:58.112 --> 1:22:58.946
- Walking out on
Tina the other night.

1:22:58.980 --> 1:23:00.181
What do you think
I'm talking about?

1:23:00.214 --> 1:23:01.015
- Probably.

1:23:01.048 --> 1:23:02.449
- Probably definitely.

1:23:02.482 --> 1:23:04.051
- Yeah, probably
probably probably.

1:23:04.085 --> 1:23:05.518
- Okay, I gotta go.
- Where are you going?

1:23:05.552 --> 1:23:08.089
Where are you going?
I'm talking to you!

1:23:08.122 --> 1:23:09.623
What are you walking
out on me for?

1:23:09.656 --> 1:23:11.158
- Okay, what do you need, Bill?

1:23:11.192 --> 1:23:13.526
- I'm the one who called it in.

1:23:13.560 --> 1:23:14.494
- You were the one?

1:23:14.527 --> 1:23:15.428
- Yeah.

1:23:15.462 --> 1:23:16.863
- You called it in on Tina?

1:23:16.897 --> 1:23:17.797
- That's right.

1:23:17.831 --> 1:23:19.000
- Bill, how could you do that?

1:23:19.033 --> 1:23:21.501
- Because nobody's gonna
tell her the truth.

1:23:21.534 --> 1:23:22.970
She needs help.

1:23:23.004 --> 1:23:25.039
- So you just decide to
just do it all by yourself?

1:23:25.072 --> 1:23:26.873
- No one else was gonna do it.
- Oh my God, Bill.

1:23:26.908 --> 1:23:27.807
- Listen, listen.
- Do you realize

1:23:27.841 --> 1:23:29.210
that I can't tell them this?

1:23:29.243 --> 1:23:30.644
I can't tell them this.
- What?

1:23:30.677 --> 1:23:31.678
- You just made
me an accomplice.

1:23:31.711 --> 1:23:33.147
- No no no, listen, listen.

1:23:33.180 --> 1:23:35.582
She's the sick person,
you're a good person.

1:23:35.615 --> 1:23:36.951
And you got that
from your mother.

1:23:36.984 --> 1:23:38.585
- Oh my God, Bill.
- Wait a minute.

1:23:38.618 --> 1:23:40.087
Maybe I'm right
and you're wrong,

1:23:40.121 --> 1:23:41.821
and maybe you're right and I'm-

1:23:41.855 --> 1:23:46.459
Oh, fucking guy.

1:23:56.203 --> 1:23:59.806
- One of the
most tragic of the moments

1:23:59.839 --> 1:24:00.774
of the war-

1:25:05.206 --> 1:25:06.639
- Hey, thanks boss man.

1:25:26.327 --> 1:25:27.627
Month-to-month, right?

1:25:43.244 --> 1:25:44.311
- Hey Sam. Sorry,
just closing up.

1:25:44.345 --> 1:25:45.913
- Hey, Mary.

1:25:45.946 --> 1:25:48.315
Just, she's not here, is she?

1:25:48.349 --> 1:25:49.917
- No, not right now.
She already left.

1:25:49.950 --> 1:25:52.053
- I just wanted to
drop this off for her.

1:25:52.086 --> 1:25:52.886
- Okay, great.

1:25:52.920 --> 1:25:54.188
I'll get it to her.

1:25:54.221 --> 1:25:55.622
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1:25:55.655 --> 1:25:57.724
Good to see you.
- Yeah, you too, you too.

1:25:57.757 --> 1:25:58.591
Okay.

1:26:51.845 --> 1:26:53.414
- Good morning.
- Hey.

1:26:53.447 --> 1:26:54.781
- What are you
doing here so early?

1:26:54.814 --> 1:26:58.085
- I came in to get
some inventory out.

1:26:58.119 --> 1:26:59.053
- Oh, great.

1:27:04.425 --> 1:27:05.792
Kate, are you okay?

1:27:05.825 --> 1:27:06.927
- Yeah, yeah.

1:27:13.033 --> 1:27:13.867
- Hey.

1:27:15.236 --> 1:27:16.070
Come here.

1:27:17.770 --> 1:27:18.405
It's okay.

1:27:20.007 --> 1:27:20.840
It's okay.

1:27:25.712 --> 1:27:26.914
- Hey Bill, I'm at
the coffee shop,

1:27:26.947 --> 1:27:28.382
and if you're hungry,

1:27:28.415 --> 1:27:31.352
there's really really good
barbecue in the fridge, okay?

1:27:31.385 --> 1:27:33.154
Love you man.
- Thank you.

1:27:33.187 --> 1:27:34.421
What happened to
the other artist?

1:27:34.455 --> 1:27:36.789
- Oh, we have a new
artist working now.

1:27:36.823 --> 1:27:37.857
Yeah.
- Not my cup of tea.

1:27:37.891 --> 1:27:39.260
It's a little
unfinished or something.

1:27:39.293 --> 1:27:40.127
I don't know.

1:27:44.231 --> 1:27:45.466
- Hi.
- Hey, Mary.

1:27:45.499 --> 1:27:46.333
- How are you?

1:27:46.367 --> 1:27:47.968
I didn't know you
were working here.

1:27:48.002 --> 1:27:49.869
- Well, I'm moving
up in the world.

1:27:49.903 --> 1:27:51.372
- Yeah, yeah, I can see that.

1:27:51.405 --> 1:27:52.739
- Yeah.

1:27:52.772 --> 1:27:53.440
- It's good to see
you, it's been a while.

1:27:53.474 --> 1:27:54.909
- You too.

1:27:54.942 --> 1:27:56.843
How's your long-haired
stallion, Mark?

1:27:56.876 --> 1:27:57.478
- He's amazing.

1:27:57.511 --> 1:27:59.046
- Good.

1:27:59.079 --> 1:28:00.214
- Hi.

1:28:00.247 --> 1:28:02.316
- Um, just an Americano for me.

1:28:02.349 --> 1:28:03.450
- Americano.

1:28:05.386 --> 1:28:07.988
Uh, what do you want?

1:28:08.022 --> 1:28:09.023
I mean, to drink.

1:28:09.056 --> 1:28:10.491
Like, what would, can I-

1:28:10.524 --> 1:28:12.426
- I'll have an Americano, also.

1:28:12.459 --> 1:28:14.461
- Another Americano, thank you.

1:28:16.763 --> 1:28:21.402
- Um, hey thank you for
giving me Levi's toy.

1:28:21.435 --> 1:28:23.070
- Yeah, of course.

1:28:23.103 --> 1:28:24.771
I feel so bad that,

1:28:26.507 --> 1:28:28.075
of course.

1:28:28.108 --> 1:28:29.410
- How did you,

1:28:29.443 --> 1:28:31.478
how did you get that back?

1:28:31.512 --> 1:28:34.415
- Truthfully, I was gonna
keep that one for me.

1:28:34.448 --> 1:28:36.183
I mean, I didn't know, so, yeah.

1:28:38.785 --> 1:28:39.486
I'm glad that,

1:28:42.523 --> 1:28:44.024
Levi's a really cool name.

1:28:46.893 --> 1:28:48.062
- He was a really cool kid.

1:28:53.866 --> 1:28:57.371
Um, it's awesome to see
your art on the walls.

1:28:57.404 --> 1:28:58.339
It looks so good.

1:28:59.206 --> 1:29:00.241
- I'm gonna go play my set.

1:29:00.274 --> 1:29:01.075
Hey.

1:29:01.108 --> 1:29:02.343
- Kill it, compadre.

1:29:02.376 --> 1:29:03.544
Have you seen Ron play before?

1:29:03.577 --> 1:29:05.845
- No.
- He's so good.

1:29:05.878 --> 1:29:08.048
Do you want that
to stay or to go?

1:29:08.082 --> 1:29:08.881
- To go.

1:29:08.916 --> 1:29:10.351
- Yeah, okay.

1:29:10.384 --> 1:29:11.784
- Okay, everybody's got their
coffees and their lattes.

1:29:11.818 --> 1:29:13.220
- Mr. Vanilla, large.

1:29:13.254 --> 1:29:14.488
- It's a beautiful
day out there.

1:29:14.521 --> 1:29:15.822
It's only getting
better, everybody.

- Hey,

1:39:03.177 --> 1:39:04.578
I'm sorry to just
show up on you.

1:39:04.611 --> 1:39:05.645
I just, um,

1:39:09.416 --> 1:39:10.417
I just wanted to see you.

1:39:15.122 --> 1:39:17.357
You know, it's
been weird lately.

1:39:18.625 --> 1:39:20.460
Without Bill around.

1:39:22.662 --> 1:39:24.464
I'm packing up his things.

1:39:25.432 --> 1:39:28.735
You know, and going
through all of his things,

1:39:28.768 --> 1:39:30.437
and I have to figure out

1:39:31.172 --> 1:39:33.540
what stays and what goes.

1:39:33.573 --> 1:39:35.076
- Yeah.

1:39:35.109 --> 1:39:37.444
- And I feel like I'm
learning things about him

1:39:37.477 --> 1:39:41.082
that I wasn't supposed
to know, you know?

1:39:41.115 --> 1:39:43.450
Like, I found,

1:39:43.483 --> 1:39:44.986
he got discharged.

1:39:46.620 --> 1:39:47.821
I found these letters.

1:39:47.854 --> 1:39:50.590
The day before they
all went to fight,

1:39:50.624 --> 1:39:52.994
he got injured, and they
wouldn't let him go.

1:39:53.995 --> 1:39:54.895
You know, so.

1:40:00.567 --> 1:40:02.802
And then none of his
friends came home.

1:40:02.836 --> 1:40:04.005
Not one.

1:40:04.038 --> 1:40:06.539
And he regretted
the rest of his life

1:40:06.573 --> 1:40:09.743
that he didn't die,
which is so fucked up.

1:40:09.776 --> 1:40:12.113
And it got me thinking
as I was walking

1:40:12.146 --> 1:40:14.115
about what I would regret.

1:40:16.984 --> 1:40:18.785
That's you, Kate.

1:40:20.654 --> 1:40:21.488
I just,

1:40:22.622 --> 1:40:24.457
I just can't imagine
you not knowing

1:40:24.491 --> 1:40:25.525
what you mean to me.

1:40:32.233 --> 1:40:33.700
- I missed you.

1:40:42.977 --> 1:40:45.445
Would you like to come inside?

1:40:46.513 --> 1:40:47.547
- Yeah, I do.

1:40:52.585 --> 1:40:54.721
- It's so good to see you.

1:42:18.939 --> 1:42:20.241
- Anything about me

1:42:20.274 --> 1:42:22.642
strike you as different at all?

1:42:22.675 --> 1:42:23.777
- I don't know.

1:42:23.810 --> 1:42:25.578
I got nothing.

1:42:25.612 --> 1:42:27.281
- I'm an artist who's
sold his work now.

1:42:27.314 --> 1:42:28.349
- Oh my God!

1:42:28.382 --> 1:42:29.216
You sold a piece?

1:42:29.250 --> 1:42:31.618
- Technically, yeah.
- That's amazing!

1:42:31.651 --> 1:42:32.552
- Ron called me yesterday

1:42:32.585 --> 1:42:34.687
and told me a piece
sold at the coffee shop.

1:42:34.721 --> 1:42:36.190
- What piece?

1:42:36.223 --> 1:42:37.757
- The monster chasing the girl,

1:42:37.791 --> 1:42:39.692
but actually he just
really likes her.

1:42:40.894 --> 1:42:42.595
- I love that one.

1:42:43.630 --> 1:42:44.831
Aw.

1:42:52.173 --> 1:42:53.673
- You know if I sell
a couple more pieces,

1:42:53.706 --> 1:42:55.608
I could even pay for groceries.
