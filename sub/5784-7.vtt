WEBVTT

00:00.533 --> 00:03.135
(theme music)

00:44.844 --> 00:47.079
(horse hooves clopping)

00:47.081 --> 00:49.681
(suspenseful music)

01:11.071 --> 01:13.338
(thundering music)

01:17.343 --> 01:19.678
(gasp)
(gunshot)

01:25.018 --> 01:27.486
(gun cocking)

01:58.384 --> 02:00.519
(out of breath): Operator,
get me the police.

02:00.521 --> 02:03.689
I need a constable
at 590 Jarvis Street.

02:03.691 --> 02:06.191
Hurry!

02:06.193 --> 02:08.760
(door opening)
No!

02:08.762 --> 02:11.396
No!
(grunt)

02:15.835 --> 02:17.836
(door swinging)

02:17.838 --> 02:20.572
(distant phone ringing)

02:22.442 --> 02:24.877
(footsteps)
William?

02:24.879 --> 02:27.479
Julia!

02:27.481 --> 02:29.548
I didn't realize it was so late.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.950
Well, whatever you're doing
is very absorbing.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.752
Don't you think?

02:33.754 --> 02:36.588
Oh, it's nothing. Just
something I'm putting together.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.857
Would you like to finish it
or shall we go home?

02:38.859 --> 02:40.926
(phone ringing)
Home.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.862
Detective Murdoch.

02:43.864 --> 02:46.098
Yes, George.

02:46.100 --> 02:49.535
Yes, I'll be right there.

02:51.271 --> 02:54.273
Well, almost home.
(sigh)

02:57.043 --> 03:00.345
Sir, the victim called for
help at 10:25 p.m.,

03:00.347 --> 03:02.881
but he was shot dead before he
identified himself.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.884
Thank you, George.
Fatal gunshot wound
to the chest.

03:05.886 --> 03:08.887
Gunpowder residue suggests he
was shot at close range.

03:08.889 --> 03:12.024
And quite recently.
His body's still warm.

03:12.026 --> 03:15.394
Excuse me, ma'am. You
can't come in here.
Oh, is that so?

03:15.396 --> 03:18.864
Detective William Murdoch.
Can I help you?

03:18.866 --> 03:20.866
Billy Murdoch.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.935
And you are?
Freddie.

03:22.937 --> 03:24.736
Freddie Pink, you remember.

03:24.738 --> 03:27.172
A Governor General Young
Scholar, like yourself.

03:27.174 --> 03:29.241
Winifred Pink?

03:29.243 --> 03:31.977
I was Freddie then,
I'm still Freddie now.

03:31.979 --> 03:34.646
My God.

03:34.648 --> 03:37.549
He got to Hamish.
You know this man?

03:37.551 --> 03:40.252
Yes. And so do you, Detective.

03:40.254 --> 03:42.588
This is Hamish McTavish.

03:42.590 --> 03:45.290
Another Young Scholar,
I presume?

03:45.292 --> 03:47.926
(sighing): Oh, Hamish.
Yes, of course I remember.

03:47.928 --> 03:51.630
But you don't seem surprised
to find him dead.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.632
He was not the first
to be shot at.

03:53.634 --> 03:57.569
A week ago, this bullet
missed my head by inches.

03:57.571 --> 04:01.240
Someone is trying
to kill all of us.

04:10.950 --> 04:13.585
We all met at summer camp
in Algonquian,

04:13.587 --> 04:15.954
some 30 years ago.

04:15.956 --> 04:19.625
We were the Governor General
Young Scholars of 1875.

04:19.627 --> 04:23.362
One from each province.
And now you think someone
is trying to kill all of you?

04:23.364 --> 04:25.831
Oh, Ms. Pink, this is my wife.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.000
Dr. Julia Ogden,
the city coroner.

04:28.002 --> 04:30.902
I'm sorry to meet
under such circumstances.

04:30.904 --> 04:34.206
Likewise.
What do you think is going on?

04:34.208 --> 04:36.575
At first I thought being shot
at was related

04:36.577 --> 04:38.844
to a case that I was on.
A case?

04:38.846 --> 04:41.113
I work for a private detective
in Montreal.

04:41.115 --> 04:44.850
And you often get shot at?
Trouble has occasion
to find me.

04:44.852 --> 04:48.487
Then, two days later,
Hamish contacted me.

04:48.489 --> 04:51.390
The two of you
have stayed in contact?

04:51.392 --> 04:53.191
Just the odd letter.

04:53.193 --> 04:55.861
He was convinced
he was being followed.

04:55.863 --> 04:59.231
That's when I began to suspect
the two events were related.

04:59.233 --> 05:01.466
Hamish and I had only
one thing in common:

05:01.468 --> 05:03.268
that prize the seven of us won.

05:03.270 --> 05:06.772
But that was so long ago.
It was.

05:06.774 --> 05:09.141
But I believe that
what happened back then

05:09.143 --> 05:11.943
is the reason
that Hamish was killed.

05:11.945 --> 05:15.013
(man): <i>Edwin Clarke,</i>
<i>from New Brunswick.</i>

05:15.015 --> 05:18.083
Here.
Jacques
Devereaux, from Quebec?

05:18.085 --> 05:21.153
Here.
William Murdoch,
from Nova Scotia.

05:21.155 --> 05:24.556
Yes, sir.
Hamish McTavish, from Ontario?

05:24.558 --> 05:26.591
That's me, Mr. Collins.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.660
Where's Master
Prince Edward Island?

05:28.662 --> 05:30.929
I'm here.

05:32.665 --> 05:35.067
You? You're, uh...
Freddie Pink?

05:35.069 --> 05:38.737
Winifred, actually. I knew
I wouldn't stand a chance
if I used my proper name.

05:38.739 --> 05:41.406
You're here now!

05:41.408 --> 05:43.475
Start hauling, lads.

05:43.477 --> 05:47.779
Your brains might be fine, but
your muscles could use
some work.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.615
A girl?
Think you can keep up?

05:50.617 --> 05:53.085
(scoffing): She won't.

05:53.087 --> 05:56.588
I can take that for you.
I can manage, but thank you.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.623
William Murdoch,
from Nova Scotia.

05:58.625 --> 06:01.526
Pleased to meet you, William
Murdoch. Don't your friends
call you Billy?

06:01.528 --> 06:03.729
Not really.
Why not?

06:03.731 --> 06:06.298
Hurry up! You're
getting left behind.

06:08.601 --> 06:10.435
Thank you, Ms. James.

06:10.437 --> 06:13.572
Mr. McTavish was killed when
this .32 calibre bullet

06:13.574 --> 06:16.041
pierced a main artery.
He died instantly.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.710
I pried this out of a post on
St. Catherine Street.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.979
It's also a .32 calibre.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.551
The striations
could be a match.

06:26.553 --> 06:29.321
So the same gun, then.
As I suspected.

06:29.323 --> 06:31.590
Thank you, Doctor.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.392
You're welcome, Detective.

06:33.394 --> 06:36.495
I know this is connected to
what happened that summer.

06:36.497 --> 06:40.565
Ms. Pink, I am not in the
habit of jumping to conclusions.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.667
So you think
this is a coincidence?

06:42.669 --> 06:45.303
A man you barely knew
was killed

06:45.305 --> 06:48.140
and now you presume
all of us to be at risk.

06:48.142 --> 06:51.176
But what if it is
connected to what we found?

06:51.178 --> 06:53.779
<i>I'd prefer not</i>
<i>to be called Billy.</i>

06:53.781 --> 06:57.249
Alright, Billy.
Look!

06:57.251 --> 07:00.685
Stay back. Stay back!

07:09.328 --> 07:11.696
What are you doing?!
Helping you get him out.

07:11.698 --> 07:13.865
(grunting)
You're not scared?

07:13.867 --> 07:16.868
There's nothing to fear
from the dead, sir.

07:34.887 --> 07:37.989
Do you know him, sir?
It's Glen Singer, from town.

07:37.991 --> 07:41.626
Seems he fell overboard
and drowned.

07:41.628 --> 07:45.330
Wonder how long--
I think he died
yesterday at 4:10 p.m.

07:45.332 --> 07:48.934
How can you know that?
Why would he keep
a broken watch?

07:56.242 --> 07:59.211
I don't think
that man died by accident.

07:59.213 --> 08:01.213
So you keep saying.

08:01.215 --> 08:03.582
His watch didn't
break by itself.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.417
It likely broke when he fell
into the water.

08:05.419 --> 08:09.387
People don't just
fall out of boats.
He could have slipped.

08:09.389 --> 08:13.158
Or he was attacked.
You read too many stories.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.360
Look at the facts.

08:15.362 --> 08:17.229
What do you observe?

08:17.231 --> 08:19.631
There isn't
very much to observe.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.900
Unless...

08:26.339 --> 08:28.807
Don't do it if you daren't.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.581
Look for anything unusual.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.922
Like this?

08:46.826 --> 08:49.661
A one-and-
a-quarter-inch wound.

08:49.663 --> 08:52.330
I wonder what
he hit his head on.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.368
Maybe this is why
he fell in and drowned.

08:58.104 --> 09:00.405
Maybe. But he still
hit his head.

09:00.407 --> 09:03.875
There must be blood somewhere.

09:07.947 --> 09:09.948
No sign of any in this boat.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.350
Perhaps it was something
on the riverbed.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.553
You check the river;
I'll look around the shore.

09:14.555 --> 09:17.022
Don't get too wet.

09:22.828 --> 09:25.564
Billy! Come look at this.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.568
There.

09:32.438 --> 09:35.540
Blood.
Let me look.

09:35.542 --> 09:38.343
Told you. Murder.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.714
Yes, you were right back then.
And I'm right now.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.716
The investigation's
only just begun.

09:44.718 --> 09:47.385
I may well find another reason
for Hamish's murder.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.988
We well may.

09:52.258 --> 09:55.226
(laughing): Governor General
Young Scholar.

09:55.228 --> 09:58.730
That gathered a few snickers in
the schoolyard, I would imagine?

09:58.732 --> 10:01.733
Intelligence is nothing to be
ashamed of, Inspector.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.735
Not at all, Ms. Pink...
as long as

10:03.737 --> 10:06.137
it's not announced
with a clarion call.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.939
Point taken.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.909
Sirs. Ma'am.
Crabtree.

10:10.911 --> 10:13.011
Have you found anything
to support

10:13.013 --> 10:15.413
Ms. Pink's wild theorizing?

10:15.415 --> 10:18.116
Well, I just may have, sir.
I contacted the remaining

10:18.118 --> 10:20.552
participants of your trip,
back in 1875.

10:20.554 --> 10:22.854
And?
Well, Seymour Bailey

10:22.856 --> 10:24.689
died from a heart condition
two years ago,

10:24.691 --> 10:28.393
but Jacques Devereaux is still
alive and living in
Algonquian Park,

10:28.395 --> 10:31.062
your old stomping grounds.
Now, it just so happens

10:31.064 --> 10:33.331
Edwin Clarke is visiting
him there now.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.834
Hmm... so Hamish
is the only victim.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.670
Uh, not quite, sir.
A Mr. Quinn Proulx

10:38.672 --> 10:41.673
was shot and
killed near Gravenhurst
just a couple of months ago.

10:41.675 --> 10:44.876
The coroner's report says
a .32 calibre weapon was used.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.245
Well, there you have it.

10:47.247 --> 10:50.482
Two of us killed and
an attempt made on my life.

10:50.484 --> 10:53.084
What do you say, Detective?
Do you still think

10:53.086 --> 10:55.153
this has nothing to do with our
wilderness trip?

10:55.155 --> 10:58.890
George, book a ticket
on the next train

10:58.892 --> 11:00.725
to Algonquian.
Sir. Right away.

11:00.727 --> 11:02.927
Make that two.

11:22.014 --> 11:25.850
So. Toronto's top detective

11:25.852 --> 11:29.220
and happily married to a fine
and intelligent woman.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.423
And you? Private detective.

11:31.425 --> 11:33.525
The police have yet
to see the light

11:33.527 --> 11:35.560
and include women
amongst their ranks.

11:35.562 --> 11:38.463
Unfortunately, I don't think
that will happen for some time.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.331
Your loss.

11:40.333 --> 11:43.368
I gather you're quite
good at what you do.

11:45.504 --> 11:48.373
I telephoned ahead. Edwin and
Jacques are expecting us.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.109
You remember them, I imagine?

11:51.111 --> 11:53.111
(giggling)
(groan)

11:53.113 --> 11:57.282
Yes. Very much so.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.758
Good day, sir.
How can I help you?

12:06.760 --> 12:09.694
Good day.
I'm looking for Dr. Ogden.

12:09.696 --> 12:12.530
She will be back shortly.
Can I take a message?

12:12.532 --> 12:14.933
You are?
Rebecca James.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.935
Ms. James. I see.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.803
Oh, here's the Doctor now.

12:18.805 --> 12:21.940
Dr. Julia Ogden.
You must be Mr. Richmond.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.909
You received my application to
hire Ms. James as my assistant.

12:24.911 --> 12:27.545
Yes, and I have met Ms. James.
Everything is in order.

12:27.547 --> 12:30.615
I will be informing you of
my decision very soon.

12:30.617 --> 12:33.418
I have every confidence Ms.
James is the right candidate.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.421
I'm sure you do.
Good day.

12:41.193 --> 12:43.194
You carry that everywhere?

12:43.196 --> 12:47.298
Oh, it's Constable
Crabtree's idea.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.734
He believes it useful for
organizing one's thoughts

12:49.736 --> 12:53.772
while traveling.
A "lapboard," he calls it.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.574
I'll stick with my pad.

12:56.576 --> 12:59.144
Right.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.845
So...

13:00.847 --> 13:03.348
Why would someone
be shooting at you?

13:03.350 --> 13:05.350
Or Hamish, or Quinn?

13:05.352 --> 13:09.287
We must have seen something.
Let's say you did.

13:09.289 --> 13:12.056
Mr. Singer's watch
broke at 4:10 p.m.,

13:12.058 --> 13:13.992
so he was murdered
in the afternoon,

13:13.994 --> 13:16.161
the day before we found him.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.830
What were we doing then?

13:18.832 --> 13:20.865
Likely setting up camp.

13:20.867 --> 13:23.268
<i>You and I usually</i>
<i>put up the tents.</i>

13:23.270 --> 13:25.069
What are you doing, Billy?

13:25.071 --> 13:27.605
Positioning the third peg
using Pythagorean theorem.

13:27.607 --> 13:30.742
Which means--
The tent will
be perfectly square?

13:30.744 --> 13:33.144
Does that really matter?
It's the right way to do it.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.748
That's all. Now, why would you
pitch your tent facing east?

13:36.750 --> 13:39.751
So the morning sun'll wake me
and I'll be first in the water.

13:39.753 --> 13:42.387
What was everyone else doing
that afternoon?

13:42.389 --> 13:44.589
I don't remember.

13:46.225 --> 13:50.762
Was that the day that Hamish
and Quinn got into all
that trouble?

13:52.064 --> 13:55.333
Where are Hamish and Quinn?
I don't know, Mr. Collins.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.203
Good evening, gentlemen.

13:58.205 --> 14:00.004
May I ask what
you've been up to?

14:00.006 --> 14:04.108
Just admiring nature, sir.
Turn out your pockets, Hamish.

14:04.110 --> 14:06.377
You too, Quinn.

14:09.281 --> 14:11.282
You have been smoking?!

14:11.284 --> 14:13.351
Are you not aware of the danger,

14:13.353 --> 14:16.354
you idiot?
The ground is dry as bone.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.223
A forest fire
could ignite in seconds!

14:18.225 --> 14:21.993
Sorry, sir!
Yeah, you will be
if I catch you again.

14:21.995 --> 14:25.263
<i>They must have seen somethin.</i>

14:25.265 --> 14:27.365
Or someone.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.635
But why wait 28 years
to silence them?

14:30.637 --> 14:33.705
And why shoot at me?
I didn't see anything.

14:33.707 --> 14:36.241
Tell that to the killer.

14:39.511 --> 14:41.312
Ah, Dr. Ogden.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.314
We've been discussing the matter
of your assistant.

14:43.316 --> 14:46.017
Please, have a seat.
I believe I'll stand.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.953
Mr. Richmond, what could
you have to say

14:48.955 --> 14:51.089
that you couldn't have
said in my morgue?

14:51.091 --> 14:55.059
I'm afraid we are unable to
authorize Ms. James as
your assistant.

14:55.061 --> 14:59.330
I presume you have a reason?
Ms. James has no medical
training,

14:59.332 --> 15:01.132
therefore she is unsuited
to the position.

15:01.134 --> 15:04.335
She spent one year at the New
York Medical College for Women.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.371
And she's resuming
her studies here,

15:06.373 --> 15:08.306
at the Ontario Medical
College for Women.

15:08.308 --> 15:12.410
That cannot be the reason.
In truth, we feel a woman

15:12.412 --> 15:15.079
should not be the apprentice.
Oh, come on, man.

15:15.081 --> 15:18.283
There's been nothing but bloody
women in the morgue ever since
I've been here.

15:18.285 --> 15:21.552
I've given you reason enough.
Are you refusing

15:21.554 --> 15:24.722
a capable and qualified
candidate because of
her dark skin?

15:24.724 --> 15:29.594
Dr. Ogden, my decision
is firm and final. Good day.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.796
Ms. James will remain
in my morgue.

15:31.798 --> 15:35.133
I will pay her salary myself!

15:36.669 --> 15:39.737
I can't believe it.
Unfortunately I can, Doctor.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.906
He'll bend society's
rules for himself,

15:41.908 --> 15:44.776
but that's about as far as his
tolerance will ever extend.

15:48.814 --> 15:52.784
(conductor): Algonquian! This
station stop: Algonquian!

15:52.786 --> 15:55.286
We kept looking.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.122
Do you remember?
When?

15:58.124 --> 16:00.458
After we found
the murder weapon.

16:00.460 --> 16:04.228
We kept looking for clues.
Right.

16:04.230 --> 16:06.931
<i>That's when we found</i>
<i>those symbols.</i>

16:06.933 --> 16:09.367
Freddie! Freddie, look!

16:09.369 --> 16:11.436
What?

16:13.672 --> 16:16.908
Never did find out
what those symbols meant.

16:16.910 --> 16:19.577
No, but they did seem to help

16:19.579 --> 16:21.980
point Constable Dobson
to Glen Singer's killer.

16:21.982 --> 16:23.915
Ah, yes, Joe...
Huggins.

16:23.917 --> 16:27.185
Huggins, right. But Joe
Huggins isn't shooting
at anyone.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.187
He's still in jail.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.222
He was released
two months ago.

16:31.224 --> 16:34.192
Joe Huggins was?
One and the same.

16:34.194 --> 16:37.295
We don't get
a lot of murders up here.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.664
It's mostly accidents or
misadventure.

16:39.666 --> 16:42.900
That's how Glen Singer's death
would have been reported...

16:42.902 --> 16:45.336
if it weren't for you two.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.605
<i>We pulled him out</i>
<i>of the water,</i>

16:47.607 --> 16:50.074
myself and young
William Murdoch here.

16:50.076 --> 16:52.276
It's Glen Singer.

16:52.278 --> 16:54.278
It seems he drowned.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.080
Geeze. He'll not
see Virginia again.

16:56.082 --> 17:01.319
Is Virginia his wife?
You should take a look
at his head, Constable.

17:04.156 --> 17:06.157
Nasty bash.

17:06.159 --> 17:09.060
Look what we found.
There's blood on it.

17:09.062 --> 17:11.596
We didn't touch it.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.731
Well, I'll be damned.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.935
Someone hit him.

17:17.937 --> 17:20.204
Who the heck else was out here?

17:20.206 --> 17:22.774
Do you know what
these symbols mean?

17:31.016 --> 17:33.017
Beats me.

17:33.019 --> 17:35.086
Those are Indian
tracking symbols.

17:35.088 --> 17:37.622
Are they, now?
Well, there is an Indian

17:37.624 --> 17:40.324
that lives not too far
from here -Joe Huggins.

17:40.326 --> 17:43.027
Sometimes acts as guide for
Singer, come to think of it.

17:43.029 --> 17:45.029
When he's sober enough.

17:45.031 --> 17:47.432
Billy found a bottle
on the boat.

17:50.836 --> 17:52.637
Cheap whiskey.

17:52.639 --> 17:56.074
Singer wouldn't touch this
stuff... but I know who would.

17:56.076 --> 18:00.044
Looks like I'll be paying
Joe Huggins a visit after all.

18:00.046 --> 18:03.014
Sharp eyes, you two.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.717
When I first questioned him,

18:06.719 --> 18:10.088
Joe claimed he couldn't remember
anything because of drink...

18:10.090 --> 18:12.523
but a night in my cell
sobered him up.

18:12.525 --> 18:16.427
He confessed to killing Singer
and then was sent to jail.
Yes.

18:16.429 --> 18:19.397
My guess?

18:21.133 --> 18:23.234
He's the one shooting at you.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.503
What do you want?

18:25.505 --> 18:28.239
Mr. Huggins,
we're investigating

18:28.241 --> 18:30.241
two recent murders

18:30.243 --> 18:32.310
that we believe are
connected to Mr. Singer's death,

18:32.312 --> 18:34.612
for which you served
a rather lengthy sentence.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.181
The murders were committed
since you got out of prison.

18:37.183 --> 18:41.619
Well, I didn't do them.
I've served my time.

18:41.621 --> 18:44.422
Leave me in peace.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.793
(quietly): He's not going to
tell us anything.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.062
Not today.

18:55.434 --> 18:58.836
What are you still doing here?

18:58.838 --> 19:01.405
Dr. Ogden said I was still--
Dr. Ogden has no authority

19:01.407 --> 19:03.941
here. Get out!

19:03.943 --> 19:06.277
(gasp)
I can walk out myself, sir.

19:13.919 --> 19:16.921
(French accent): Despite the
worrying circumstances,

19:16.923 --> 19:18.856
it's a pleasure
to see you both again.

19:18.858 --> 19:22.059
Indeed, Jacques. How long have
you been living up here?

19:22.061 --> 19:24.128
I bought this lodge
10 years ago.

19:24.130 --> 19:26.964
And you?
I'm just here for the fishing.

19:26.966 --> 19:30.601
It really is
a striking property.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.204
Strangely enough, it used to
belong to Mr. Singer.

19:33.206 --> 19:36.274
You have quite the
reputation, Detective.

19:36.276 --> 19:40.278
I've followed a number of your
exploits. I'm surprised
you are taking

19:40.280 --> 19:42.580
Ms. Pink's theory seriously.

19:42.582 --> 19:45.183
Hamish, Quinn and I live in
different cities,

19:45.185 --> 19:48.586
have different occupations...
apart from the Young
Scholars Award,

19:48.588 --> 19:51.122
this gunman is the only thing
we have in common.

19:51.124 --> 19:53.457
And you share this concern,
Detective?

19:53.459 --> 19:56.327
We're hoping you can
help us reconstruct

19:56.329 --> 19:58.529
the day of Mr. Singer's death.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.431
It was the same day

20:00.433 --> 20:04.035
that Mr. Collins lost his temper
with Hamish and Quinn.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.604
I remember that.
He had a mean side.

20:06.606 --> 20:09.607
That same day, he refused to
take me fishing with him
for no reason.

20:09.609 --> 20:13.477
And what do you recall, Edwin?
I suppose I was tending
the fire.

20:13.479 --> 20:16.280
That was my usual job.
You really think

20:16.282 --> 20:18.349
this line of inquiry will help
find a murderer?

20:18.351 --> 20:20.918
It's the way detectives work.
I wasn't aware

20:20.920 --> 20:24.755
clutching at straws was
a standard investigative
procedure. But I suppose

20:24.757 --> 20:28.159
when you only handle tawdry
divorce cases...

20:30.262 --> 20:32.296
Do you think
we're also in danger?

20:32.298 --> 20:34.465
It's certainly a possibility.

20:34.467 --> 20:37.501
After all, the four remaining
Young Scholars

20:37.503 --> 20:39.704
are all now in one place.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.772
Ready to be picked off,

20:41.774 --> 20:45.276
one by one.

20:51.617 --> 20:54.218
Good morning.
Did you sleep well?

20:54.220 --> 20:57.722
Not really.
I fear we're no closer

20:57.724 --> 21:00.157
to finding Hamish
and Quinn's killer.

21:00.159 --> 21:02.159
Well, Edwin and Jacques
weren't much help.

21:02.161 --> 21:04.328
Neither remember anything
significant.

21:04.330 --> 21:06.631
Neither do we.

21:06.633 --> 21:09.967
Where are we going?

21:09.969 --> 21:12.403
Back to the scene
of the crime.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.205
Expecting a 28-year-old clue?

21:14.207 --> 21:16.707
At this point,
I'll take anything.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.178
(bird chirping)

21:22.948 --> 21:25.783
I see his body lying there
like it was yesterday.

21:25.785 --> 21:28.653
You didn't seem scared to me

21:28.655 --> 21:32.857
that day.
I was. I just didn't show it.

21:34.159 --> 21:37.628
Nowadays, a dead body barely
makes me feel anything.

21:37.630 --> 21:41.198
Do you have much occasion to
see dead bodies?

21:41.200 --> 21:45.569
Those tawdry divorce cases
can get out of hand.

21:45.571 --> 21:48.172
Let's retrace our steps,
shall we?

21:53.211 --> 21:56.147
The Indian symbols
are still here.

21:56.149 --> 21:58.816
That's strange.

21:58.818 --> 22:02.053
The tree growth should have
absorbed them by now.

22:02.055 --> 22:05.456
Someone's gone to some trouble
to keep them visible.

22:05.458 --> 22:08.225
Perhaps it marks
a hiding place.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.697
Or a triangulation.

22:12.699 --> 22:15.066
There would be a third symbol.

22:16.802 --> 22:19.403
Indeed there would.
A third symbol!

22:19.405 --> 22:21.839
Now to find the midway point.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.275
Perhaps the Pythagorean
theorem would help.

22:24.277 --> 22:27.345
Not in this case, Freddie.
That would require right angles.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.980
What if it's a square?

22:32.451 --> 22:34.552
Well, that certainly
is a possibility.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.220
Uh, in that case...

22:39.825 --> 22:42.360
(muttering): One, two, three...

22:44.096 --> 22:46.731
Hiding spot would be somewhere--
Here!

22:46.733 --> 22:48.733
Look at this.

22:48.735 --> 22:50.935
Someone's deliberately
disguising this spot.

22:50.937 --> 22:55.272
(grunting)
Something could
have been hidden here.

23:02.581 --> 23:04.849
Something still is.

23:07.285 --> 23:09.620
No visible markings.

23:11.456 --> 23:13.324
This is pure gold.

23:13.326 --> 23:17.194
Where one gold coin was
buried, there were
likely many others.

23:17.196 --> 23:20.998
Buried treasure.
It's like a children's story.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.267
This has something to do with

23:23.269 --> 23:25.169
Singer's murder. I'll lay money.

23:25.171 --> 23:27.772
Which means his murderer is
the one who's been maintaining

23:27.774 --> 23:31.542
these symbols.
Then it wasn't Joe Huggins.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.444
He's been in jail
all these years.

23:33.446 --> 23:36.180
No, it wasn't.

23:36.182 --> 23:40.151
Joe Huggins pled guilty to the
murder of Glen Singer.

23:40.153 --> 23:42.319
Who pleads guilty
if he's not guilty?

23:42.321 --> 23:45.723
What can you tell us
about Glen Singer?

23:45.725 --> 23:48.793
Singer... showed up
sometime in the 1860s.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.995
Kept to himself, mostly.

23:50.997 --> 23:53.631
There's not much more to tell.

23:56.067 --> 23:58.502
I'll have my constable look
into Glen Singer.

23:58.504 --> 24:01.138
How nice. I do
all my own legwork.

24:01.140 --> 24:04.008
Really? I would have assumed
one of your colleagues would--

24:04.010 --> 24:06.544
Because no one will
speak to a woman?

24:06.546 --> 24:08.946
Sometimes that's true.

24:08.948 --> 24:12.283
But often, my gender helps
more than it hinders.

24:12.285 --> 24:14.518
Where are you going?

24:14.520 --> 24:16.720
To make a cup of tea.

24:21.660 --> 24:23.761
(phone ringing)
Crabtree.

24:23.763 --> 24:25.763
Ah, sir. I do hope

24:25.765 --> 24:27.765
you're enjoying your
sojourn in the woods.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.900
I'm not on holiday, George.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.902
Uh, no. I daresay not, sir.

24:31.904 --> 24:34.839
I remember all too well the
perils of the wilderness.

24:34.841 --> 24:38.008
I need you to look into
something for me:

24:38.010 --> 24:41.979
find out everything you can
about a Glen Singer.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.415
[He would have come to the
Algonquian area]

24:44.417 --> 24:46.283
[sometime in the 1860s]

24:46.285 --> 24:49.386
[and he may have come into
possession of some gold coins.]

24:49.388 --> 24:53.557
Gold coins. Right away, sir.
[Thank you.]

24:53.559 --> 24:56.760
Have you found
the culprit yet?

24:56.762 --> 24:59.129
Not as yet.

24:59.131 --> 25:01.298
I don't think I'll sleep
again until you do.

25:01.300 --> 25:04.902
(small laugh)
That's quite the collection.

25:04.904 --> 25:08.105
Ah, <i>oui.</i>
<i>They came with the house.</i>

25:08.107 --> 25:10.341
Edwin is researching
their histories.

25:10.343 --> 25:13.978
Especially that buoy knife.
They're not much for protection,

25:13.980 --> 25:16.881
but they're good
for conversation.

25:16.883 --> 25:21.519
We'll find him, Jacques.
Don't worry.

25:21.521 --> 25:24.054
Where is Freddie?

25:32.097 --> 25:34.565
You're no killer,
are you, Joe?

25:37.702 --> 25:40.704
A Native Indian
with a penchant for the drink.

25:40.706 --> 25:42.806
No one would have believed you.

25:42.808 --> 25:45.042
You must have felt
like you had no choice.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.778
You were already guilty in
everyone's eyes anyway.

25:47.780 --> 25:51.115
Say I did it, serve 25 years.

25:51.117 --> 25:53.918
Go to trial, get hanged.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.920
Those were my choices.

25:55.922 --> 25:59.456
So you confessed.
You don't bear a grudge?

25:59.458 --> 26:01.525
I used to.

26:01.527 --> 26:03.694
Going to jail
got me sober, though.

26:03.696 --> 26:06.163
I don't think that would have
happened otherwise.

26:08.767 --> 26:11.669
Do you recognize this symbol?

26:11.671 --> 26:14.505
Tracking symbol. Not mine.

26:14.507 --> 26:16.507
Do you know whose?

26:16.509 --> 26:18.509
I don't know.
Singer's?

26:18.511 --> 26:20.477
Could be.

26:20.479 --> 26:23.113
He used to ask about that sort
of thing from time to time.

26:23.115 --> 26:26.050
Bring a bottle over,
get to talking.

26:26.052 --> 26:28.118
Sometimes he had
a young fellow with him.

26:28.120 --> 26:31.722
Who was the young fellow?
I don't remember a lot

26:31.724 --> 26:34.091
from those times.

26:34.093 --> 26:37.061
Fancied himself
a guide of these woods.

26:39.164 --> 26:41.632
Thank you, Mr. Huggins.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.404
Do you think he meant
Mr. Collins?

26:47.406 --> 26:49.873
Can't think of anyone else.
If Collins knew

26:49.875 --> 26:51.875
about the symbols,
then he knew about the gold.

26:51.877 --> 26:53.877
Yes, but Collins
can't be our killer.

26:53.879 --> 26:56.780
He was with us at the campsite.
Was he?

26:58.817 --> 27:01.352
Jacques said Collins
went fishing.

27:01.354 --> 27:03.253
<i>By himself.</i>

27:03.255 --> 27:07.057
I'm starving! How long does it
take to catch a fish?

27:07.059 --> 27:09.059
(French accent): I know all
the fish in these waters.

27:09.061 --> 27:11.261
Why wouldn't Mr. Collins
take me too?

27:11.263 --> 27:14.231
Well, the fire's ready, for
whenever Mr. Collins returns.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.266
Dinner's here!

27:16.268 --> 27:18.168
Jacques, take this, please?

27:18.170 --> 27:21.271
Walleye!

27:21.273 --> 27:25.009
Where are Hamish and Quinn?
I don't know, Mr. Collins.

27:25.011 --> 27:28.312
Hamish and Quinn
were in the woods.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.314
And now they're dead.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.116
They may well have seen Collins.

27:32.118 --> 27:35.252
Returning from
the scene of the crime.

27:39.557 --> 27:42.960
Mr. Collins! William Murdoch.

27:42.962 --> 27:47.097
Freddie Pink. We were Young
Scholars back in 1875.

27:47.099 --> 27:49.233
Yeah, I heard you two
were up here.

27:49.235 --> 27:52.236
Then you've also heard that
two of our group have
been murdered.

27:52.238 --> 27:56.774
Don't know why
you're talking to me.

27:56.776 --> 27:58.909
Where were you three days ago?

27:58.911 --> 28:00.611
Here.

28:00.613 --> 28:03.147
And last week?
Here.

28:03.149 --> 28:06.050
Can anyone attest
to your whereabouts?

28:06.052 --> 28:08.952
I expect not.

28:10.822 --> 28:13.624
What can you tell us
about Glen Singer?

28:13.626 --> 28:16.427
Singer? What does he
have to do with anything?

28:16.429 --> 28:19.630
He's been dead for years.
Just how well did you
know him?

28:19.632 --> 28:21.999
As well as anybody.

28:22.001 --> 28:25.436
Did odd jobs for him and such.
Helped build his house.

28:25.438 --> 28:28.372
You and Singer used to drink
with Joe Huggins.

28:28.374 --> 28:32.643
What of it?
He taught you
Indian tracking methods.

28:32.645 --> 28:34.878
So much so that
you were able to identify

28:34.880 --> 28:36.880
the symbols on the tree
next to where

28:36.882 --> 28:40.150
we found Singer's body.
Was I?

28:42.487 --> 28:45.889
Mr. Collins,
you left the campsite

28:45.891 --> 28:48.125
to catch food for us,
right around the time

28:48.127 --> 28:50.227
that Mr. Singer was murdered.
You went alone,

28:50.229 --> 28:52.963
despite Jacques' pleas.
I don't remember that.

28:52.965 --> 28:55.833
But I do remember
catching those fish

28:55.835 --> 28:59.103
in the exact opposite direction
of where Singer was found.

29:01.439 --> 29:03.173
I don't suppose
you could prove that.

29:03.175 --> 29:06.977
I don't suppose
you can prove otherwise.

29:12.884 --> 29:15.352
He did it.
I feel it in my bones.

29:15.354 --> 29:19.156
But your feelings aren't
evidence, of which we have none.

29:19.158 --> 29:21.759
(gunshot)

29:28.299 --> 29:30.601
(whispering): Freddie!

29:32.637 --> 29:34.638
(man): Ah!

29:34.640 --> 29:39.276
I hit him!
Freddie, stop!

29:50.855 --> 29:53.824
(muttering): Damnit.

29:53.826 --> 29:55.859
I lost him. Again.

29:55.861 --> 29:57.928
What were you
thinking, Freddie?

29:57.930 --> 30:00.297
That I might catch the man
who's trying to kill me.

30:00.299 --> 30:03.834
You are reckless.
I'm enterprising.

30:03.836 --> 30:07.905
This is a police
investigation, Ms. Pink.

30:17.582 --> 30:19.883
.32 calibre.
As we suspected.

30:19.885 --> 30:23.020
What now, "Detective"?

30:32.797 --> 30:35.232
(Ms. James sighs.)
Ms. James!

30:35.234 --> 30:37.768
Goodness, you are
a hard woman to find.

30:37.770 --> 30:39.736
Sorry, Doctor.
I have to find a job.

30:39.738 --> 30:41.805
But you already
have one, with me.

30:41.807 --> 30:45.843
You're very kind,
but Mr. Richmond doesn't
share your belief in me.

30:45.845 --> 30:49.313
He came to the morgue?
While I wasn't there?

30:49.315 --> 30:51.648
That cowardly, self-important--

30:51.650 --> 30:53.483
I appreciate everything
you've done,

30:53.485 --> 30:55.686
but my future at the morgue
isn't meant to be.

30:55.688 --> 30:59.756
I won't accept that.
I've been lucky to
know you, Dr. Ogden.

30:59.758 --> 31:02.025
Now, I must be getting on.

31:10.501 --> 31:12.502
Inspector.

31:12.504 --> 31:14.338
Doctor. To what
do I owe the pleasure?

31:14.340 --> 31:17.941
Mr. Richmond.
Oh, I knew I hadn't
heard the last of this.

31:17.943 --> 31:21.144
Exactly which
of society's rules

31:21.146 --> 31:24.248
is Mr. Richmond
so prone to bending?

31:24.250 --> 31:28.085
Are you certain that
Ms. James is worth the trouble?

31:30.255 --> 31:32.289
Tell me what you know.

31:32.291 --> 31:33.957
(sigh)

31:33.959 --> 31:36.793
I have something you may find
of interest, sir.

31:36.795 --> 31:40.764
I began my search for lost gold
coins in the 1860s,

31:40.766 --> 31:42.900
when I happened upon
a newspaper account

31:42.902 --> 31:45.168
of a Confederate soldier, sir.

31:45.170 --> 31:46.970
Uh...

31:46.972 --> 31:49.706
a "Horace Wilcott"
of Ashby's Cavalry.

31:49.708 --> 31:52.075
Now, at the end of
the American Civil War,

31:52.077 --> 31:54.745
[he was entrusted with
transporting a large cache]

31:54.747 --> 31:57.247
[of gold to an undisclosed
hiding place.]

31:57.249 --> 31:59.049
Go on.
[Well, sir.]

31:59.051 --> 32:02.786
This Wilcott fellow up and
disappeared, as did the gold.

32:02.788 --> 32:05.289
George, what has this
to do with our case?

32:05.291 --> 32:07.958
Sir, Wilcott was tracked all
the way to the Canadian border,

32:07.960 --> 32:10.527
where his trail goes cold.
Wanted posters were spread

32:10.529 --> 32:14.731
far and wide, but neither he nor
his "booty" were ever found.

32:14.733 --> 32:17.467
George, there are
a great many such stories.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.803
Indeed there are, but this is
the only one I found

32:19.805 --> 32:22.339
involving a soldier
from a small town

32:22.341 --> 32:25.108
by the name of Singer's Glen.

32:25.110 --> 32:27.811
Glen Singer.

32:29.013 --> 32:32.482
So Horace Wilcott stole the
gold and brought it here,

32:32.484 --> 32:34.484
changing his name
to Glen Singer.

32:34.486 --> 32:36.320
After his hometown
in Virginia.

32:36.322 --> 32:38.622
Virginia...

32:38.624 --> 32:41.325
Seems he drowned. Geeze.

32:41.327 --> 32:45.195
He'll not see Virginia again.
Is Virginia his wife?

32:45.197 --> 32:47.064
It's Constable Dobson.

32:47.066 --> 32:49.066
He knew Singer was
from Virginia.

32:49.068 --> 32:51.835
He would have known
about the gold

32:51.837 --> 32:53.837
from the wanted posters.
That explains why

32:53.839 --> 32:56.873
the three of us were his
targets. I heard him
say Virginia,

32:56.875 --> 32:59.042
and Hamish and Quinn must have
seen him in the woods.

32:59.044 --> 33:03.647
But we still don't know why now,
all these years later.

33:03.649 --> 33:06.616
Only one person
can answer that.

33:13.124 --> 33:15.425
I've had occasion
to use one before.

33:15.427 --> 33:17.694
Mm...

33:26.204 --> 33:28.271
Hello?

33:43.321 --> 33:47.057
.32 calibre.
Suicide.

33:47.059 --> 33:49.459
Not how I thought
this story would end.

33:49.461 --> 33:52.362
Nor I.

33:58.770 --> 34:01.338
This wound is consistent with
the grazing of a bullet,

34:01.340 --> 34:05.175
and recently at that.

34:05.177 --> 34:07.411
That's my doing.

34:07.413 --> 34:09.479
The bullets that killed
Hamish and Quinn

34:09.481 --> 34:12.382
likely came from
this .32 calibre gun.

34:14.118 --> 34:15.952
Look at this.

34:15.954 --> 34:19.389
Train tickets. Gravenhurst,
on the day Quinn was killed,

34:19.391 --> 34:22.092
and Toronto, and Montreal.

34:22.094 --> 34:24.361
Well, there you have it.

34:24.363 --> 34:27.164
All of our questions answered.
Dobson killed

34:27.166 --> 34:30.333
Singer for the gold,
pinned it on Joe Huggins

34:30.335 --> 34:33.336
and then began killing the
witnesses who could expose him.

34:33.338 --> 34:37.274
Right, but why would Dobson
wait so many years

34:37.276 --> 34:39.342
to start killing
to protect his secret?

34:39.344 --> 34:42.179
We may never know.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.417
Wait.

34:47.419 --> 34:49.286
What?

34:49.288 --> 34:52.722
He has a sizable contusion
on the back of his head.

34:52.724 --> 34:55.192
He didn't hit himself
on the back of the head.

34:55.194 --> 34:57.427
He most certainly didn't.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.896
This wasn't a suicide.

34:59.898 --> 35:02.566
Dobson's been murdered.

35:02.568 --> 35:04.768
For the gold?

35:04.770 --> 35:06.870
Or some other reason?

35:06.872 --> 35:08.872
(sigh)

35:08.874 --> 35:11.241
Did you find anything else?

35:16.114 --> 35:20.250
Here.
No need for all that.

35:22.787 --> 35:26.189
He's hardly alive to complain.

35:32.463 --> 35:35.265
"I know you killed
Glen Singer."

35:35.267 --> 35:38.602
"$500 will keep you
from the noose."

35:38.604 --> 35:41.171
Blackmail.

35:41.173 --> 35:43.640
These letters began
three months ago.

35:45.376 --> 35:47.377
He must have thought the
blackmailer was one of us.

35:47.379 --> 35:49.412
This is why he needed
to silence us now.

35:49.414 --> 35:53.450
And he appears to have
succeeded. The letters
stopped after Hamish's death.

35:53.452 --> 35:57.087
I've been corresponding with
Hamish over the years.

35:57.089 --> 35:59.756
This isn't his handwriting.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.825
No?

36:03.494 --> 36:05.495
Well, it couldn't
have been Quinn.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.564
The letters continued
after his death.

36:07.566 --> 36:12.235
So the blackmailer has to be
Collins, Jacques, or Edwin.

36:12.237 --> 36:16.606
My money is on Collins.

36:20.645 --> 36:23.213
Goodnight, ladies.

36:28.953 --> 36:30.954
Good evening, Mr. Richmond.

36:30.956 --> 36:32.989
Dr. Ogden, what--

36:32.991 --> 36:36.126
How dare you follow me?

36:36.128 --> 36:38.328
I'm merely here
to offer you a lift.

36:38.330 --> 36:41.264
Your wife will be wondering
what urgent business

36:41.266 --> 36:44.167
has kept you so late.

36:48.539 --> 36:51.374
You think Mr. Collins was
blackmailing Constable Dobson?

36:51.376 --> 36:53.376
I wouldn't be surprised.

36:53.378 --> 36:55.946
But how did he know
Dobson killed Singer?

36:55.948 --> 36:58.181
He must have seen
Dobson returning

36:58.183 --> 37:00.183
from the scene of the murder
when he was out fishing.

37:00.185 --> 37:02.018
Eh, <i>non,</i> he couldn't have.

37:02.020 --> 37:03.920
He was fishing in the opposite
direction of the murder scene.

37:03.922 --> 37:06.823
He said as much, but it would
be impossible to prove it.

37:06.825 --> 37:09.793
You could prove it.
He came back with walleye.

37:09.795 --> 37:13.063
Care to elaborate?

37:13.065 --> 37:15.665
Well, walleye are found
in deep water

37:15.667 --> 37:17.467
with hard, rocky bottoms,

37:17.469 --> 37:19.703
or weed beds in shallow lakes.

37:19.705 --> 37:22.272
There was no such spot
between our old campsite

37:22.274 --> 37:24.874
and where we found Singer.

37:24.876 --> 37:27.811
Then someone else must have
seen Dobson in the woods.

37:27.813 --> 37:30.280
But who?

37:30.282 --> 37:33.049
<i>I was pitching the tent.</i>

37:33.051 --> 37:35.285
What are you doing, Billy?
<i>I was poking fun at you,</i>

37:35.287 --> 37:39.089
<i>pitching the tent.</i>
<i>Collins was fishing.</i>

37:39.091 --> 37:40.890
<i>Jacques was sulking.</i>

37:40.892 --> 37:43.426
<i>Hamish and Quinn</i>
<i>were off smoking.</i>

37:43.428 --> 37:45.562
<i>Edwin was lighting the fire.</i>

37:45.564 --> 37:47.497
<i>Right.</i>

37:47.499 --> 37:49.766
<i>But for that, you would</i>
<i>need firewood.</i>

37:49.768 --> 37:51.735
<i>Of course.</i>

37:51.737 --> 37:54.604
<i>Edwin must have gone</i>
<i>into the woods.</i>

38:08.185 --> 38:10.453
<i>Edwin saw Dobson.</i>

38:12.456 --> 38:15.458
Edwin?
But how could he have known

38:15.460 --> 38:18.128
about Singer and
the stolen gold?

38:20.531 --> 38:23.166
Edwin had been researching
these weapons.

38:23.168 --> 38:25.935
Most recently, this buoy knife.

38:25.937 --> 38:28.038
Right?

38:28.040 --> 38:31.007
See the inscription?

38:31.009 --> 38:34.511
"Ashby's Cavalry. H.W."

38:34.513 --> 38:37.414
Horace Wilcott.
Edwin must have found out

38:37.416 --> 38:40.317
about Glen Singer
and the stolen gold,

38:40.319 --> 38:42.585
the same way my constable did.

38:48.626 --> 38:50.460
I'll check the porch.

38:50.462 --> 38:53.196
(distant): Where are
you going, Edwin?

38:53.198 --> 38:55.198
(Edwin): Leave me alone!

38:55.200 --> 38:57.901
(grunting)

38:57.903 --> 39:00.036
(groaning)

39:00.038 --> 39:04.841
Not so pleasant, is it?
Your murderer, Detective.

39:04.843 --> 39:07.711
Good work, Detective.

39:13.217 --> 39:15.452
You seem to know
everything already.

39:15.454 --> 39:18.955
You never imagined
Dobson would start killing
anyone over a few letters.

39:18.957 --> 39:23.026
Of course not. I didn't even
know about Hamish and Quinn.

39:23.028 --> 39:25.829
Or you, Freddie.

39:25.831 --> 39:29.366
Until we informed you.
I stopped the letters
right away.

39:29.368 --> 39:33.703
But after Dobson took the
shots at the two of you today,

39:33.705 --> 39:36.406
I knew I had to stop him.

39:36.408 --> 39:40.677
I couldn't bear any more blood
on my conscience.

39:43.581 --> 39:46.750
Don't know why
I bothered to run.

39:46.752 --> 39:50.320
You two were good
detectives 28 years ago.

39:52.056 --> 39:54.557
You're even better now.

40:02.800 --> 40:05.168
Bit like old times.

40:05.170 --> 40:07.837
The two of us
investigating together.

40:07.839 --> 40:10.774
It was, wasn't it?

40:10.776 --> 40:13.476
I imagine your employer will
be anxious to get you back

40:13.478 --> 40:16.112
in Montreal.
I may not be

40:16.114 --> 40:18.381
so very welcome there,
at the moment.

40:18.383 --> 40:21.050
Are you in trouble?
Nothing a bit of distance

40:21.052 --> 40:24.888
can't solve.
Perhaps I can help.

40:24.890 --> 40:27.524
Not this time, but I may

40:27.526 --> 40:29.726
bank that offer for the future.

40:29.728 --> 40:31.961
Oh?
It's high time

40:31.963 --> 40:36.065
that I hung out my own shingle:
Pink's Detective Agency.

40:36.067 --> 40:38.368
Congratulations.

40:38.370 --> 40:41.938
In Toronto.
Oh.

40:41.940 --> 40:45.008
I don't know that that
would be such a good idea.

40:45.010 --> 40:49.512
Why not? Toronto seems the
ideal place for my venture.

40:49.514 --> 40:51.614
And being acquainted
with the top detective

40:51.616 --> 40:54.417
and his coroner wife
might come in handy.

40:54.419 --> 40:57.787
Montreal is one thing,

40:57.789 --> 41:00.390
but I don't know that you'd find
the same abundance of work

41:00.392 --> 41:02.525
in Toronto the Good.

41:02.527 --> 41:05.595
We shall see.

41:15.606 --> 41:17.874
I'm sorry to
disturb you, Dr. Ogden.

41:17.876 --> 41:19.976
I've only come
to collect my things.

41:19.978 --> 41:23.279
Ms. James.
A letter came for you.

41:23.281 --> 41:25.548
A letter for me? Here?

41:25.550 --> 41:28.685
You should open it.
Might be important.

41:30.254 --> 41:32.255
"Dear Ms. James, your
application to work

41:32.257 --> 41:34.791
at the city morgue
has been approved."

41:34.793 --> 41:38.161
Dr. Ogden, I don't understand.

41:38.163 --> 41:40.163
Seems clear enough.

41:40.165 --> 41:41.965
But how?

41:41.967 --> 41:44.367
I imagine Mr. Richmond
was shown the rashness

41:44.369 --> 41:46.169
of his judgement.

41:46.171 --> 41:48.738
Now put on your apron.
Let's get to work!

41:57.281 --> 42:00.450
Do not turn around.

42:00.452 --> 42:02.652
(laughing): William, really.

42:02.654 --> 42:04.888
I only need a moment more.

42:08.192 --> 42:10.226
Alright.

42:10.228 --> 42:12.529
You may look.

42:12.531 --> 42:15.431
(soft piano music)

42:15.433 --> 42:17.433
What is it?

42:17.435 --> 42:20.370
It's... our home,

42:20.372 --> 42:22.839
that I'm going to build for you.

42:22.841 --> 42:25.241
(whispering): William.

42:25.243 --> 42:28.645
It's extraordinary!

42:28.647 --> 42:31.281
Wait, there's more.

42:31.283 --> 42:33.917
More?

42:39.356 --> 42:42.125
There's the parlour...

42:42.127 --> 42:44.127
the conservatory...

42:44.129 --> 42:45.995
piano room...

42:45.997 --> 42:48.932
bedrooms, here and here...

42:48.934 --> 42:52.201
and a dishwashing cupboard.

42:52.203 --> 42:55.705
Dishwashing cupboard?
Oh, yes. Fully automated.

42:55.707 --> 42:57.707
No need for servants.

42:57.709 --> 43:00.443
I'm still sorting the details.

43:00.445 --> 43:02.812
But this!

43:02.814 --> 43:05.682
A laboratory workshop.

43:05.684 --> 43:09.619
Laboratory for you,
workshop for me.

43:09.621 --> 43:12.922
To share?
Yes.

43:12.924 --> 43:16.559
So we may always benefit from
each other's counsel.

43:18.295 --> 43:20.496
William Murdoch.

43:20.498 --> 43:22.932
It couldn't be more perfect.

43:22.934 --> 43:26.202
(sighing)

43:26.204 --> 43:28.571
Really?
Yeah.

43:31.642 --> 43:34.844
