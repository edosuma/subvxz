WEBVTT

00:08.130 --> 00:14.090
THIS KIND OF PROGRESS AND
DEVELOPMENT IS EXACTLY
WHAT THIS CITY NEEDS.

00:15.800 --> 00:18.260
&lt;CHEERING AND CLAPPING&gt;

00:18.310 --> 00:20.640
IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR SERVING
THE CITY OF ST. JOHN'S.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.560
AND PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE,

00:22.600 --> 00:25.810
BUT THERE IS MORE WORK
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

00:25.860 --> 00:28.270
AND THAT IS WHY
I SEEK RE-ELECTION

00:28.320 --> 00:29.610
TO FINISH THE WORK...

00:29.650 --> 00:30.860
WE STARTED TOGETHER.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.860
I THINK WHAT THE MAYOR
IS TRYING TO SAY IS THAT

00:32.900 --> 00:35.070
HE'LL BULLDOZE CABOT TOWER
AND PAVE OVER THE NARROWS,

00:35.110 --> 00:36.450
ALL IN THE NAME OF PROGRESS.

00:36.490 --> 00:38.200
OF COURSE,
WHAT MR. SLADE IS SAYING

00:38.240 --> 00:40.250
COULDN'T BE FARTHER FROM
THE TRUTH. AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:40.290 --> 00:42.080
I LOOK FORWARD TO
DEBATING THESE ISSUES

00:42.120 --> 00:44.460
WITH HIM AND ANY
OTHER CANDIDATE.

00:44.500 --> 00:45.790
I DON'T LIKE THIS GUY.

00:45.830 --> 00:47.130
ME NEITHER.

00:47.170 --> 00:49.090
-WHAT WERE YOU DOING TO ME?
-YOU'RE SUCH A WUSS.

00:49.130 --> 00:51.840
YOU CAN'T JUST SET MY
HAIR ON FIRE LIKE THAT,
YOU KNOW. I HAVE FEELINGS.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.010
KNOCK IT OFF!

00:56.760 --> 00:58.010
GOOD MORNING.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.100
WHO WAS THAT?

01:00.140 --> 01:01.770
GUYS, HEY, HEY, HEY. GUYS.

01:03.020 --> 01:05.310
-WHOA.
-OH, GREAT.

01:05.350 --> 01:06.270
IS SHE GONE?

01:06.310 --> 01:08.150
-WHO IS SHE?
-I GOTTA GET TO THE BAR.

01:10.280 --> 01:12.320
-WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
-DON'T ASK ME.

01:12.360 --> 01:13.190
THEY'RE YOURS.

01:14.030 --> 01:15.780
THAT'S IT.

01:15.820 --> 01:16.990
I GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.

01:17.030 --> 01:18.030
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

01:18.580 --> 01:19.620
YEAH?

01:19.660 --> 01:21.160
WE GOT TO GO MEET
THE CLIENT NOW.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.080
I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T MEETING
HIM FOR, LIKE,
AN HOUR FROM NOW.

01:23.120 --> 01:24.160
I DON'T CARE.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.830
I'M GOING OUT.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.130
[TONYA] THANKS FOR COMING.

01:29.170 --> 01:31.170
ARE EITHER OF YOU HANDSOME
GENTLEMEN IN THE MARKET?

01:31.210 --> 01:32.960
I'M SHOWING THIS
PLACE TO A CLIENT

01:33.010 --> 01:35.680
BEFORE THE OPEN HOUSE
STARTS IN ABOUT AN HOUR.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.140
WE WON'T TAKE
MUCH OF YOUR TIME.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.930
IT'S BEEN ON THE MARKET
SIX MONTHS NOW.

01:38.970 --> 01:40.050
I CAN'T SEEM TO MOVE IT.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.680
WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP YOU,
MISS ST. CROIX?

01:41.720 --> 01:44.810
I'M DEVELOPING A MAJOR PROJECT
ON THE SOUTH SIDE HILLS.

01:44.850 --> 01:46.850
OH, YEAH. OCEAN POINT.

01:46.900 --> 01:49.150
THAT'S RIGHT. SOMEONE'S TRYING
TO STOP IT FROM HAPPENING.

01:49.190 --> 01:50.650
IT'S A CONTROVERSIAL
DEVELOPMENT.

01:50.690 --> 01:52.230
TAKING THE SOUTH
SIDE HILLS AND

01:52.280 --> 01:54.490
TURNING IT INTO A HOUSING
DEVELOPMENT IS A
BIT OF A DEAL.

01:54.530 --> 01:56.150
YES. WELL, UH,

01:56.200 --> 01:59.280
25 PEOPLE WERE SIGNED
UP TO PURCHASE THE PROPERTY

01:59.320 --> 02:01.030
AND SOMEONE'S BEEN
LEAVING THEM MESSAGES

02:01.080 --> 02:03.750
SAYING THAT THE LAND IS TOXIC
AND SCARING THEM OFF.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.830
AND I THINK I KNOW WHO.

02:05.870 --> 02:08.250
-WHO?
-MY ARSE OF AN EX-HUSBAND.

02:09.290 --> 02:11.340
BRETT BABCOCK.

02:11.380 --> 02:13.510
BRETT IS CURRENTLY
MY BIGGEST COMPETITOR.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.050
HE LOST HIS SHARE
OF THE DEVELOPMENT

02:16.090 --> 02:18.220
WHEN I DIVORCED HIM
FOR HIS INDISCRETIONS.

02:18.260 --> 02:19.680
NOW HE'S TRYING TO RUIN IT.

02:21.350 --> 02:24.430
-AND I NEED YOU TO GET ENOUGH
PROOF TO STOP HIM.
-&lt;COUGHS&gt;

02:24.470 --> 02:26.350
HAS HE DONE ANYTHING CRIMINAL?

02:26.390 --> 02:28.440
NOT YET, BUT HE WILL.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.270
-DO YOU HEAR THAT?
-&lt;WATER RUNNING&gt;

02:31.310 --> 02:32.650
WHAT IS THAT?

02:34.030 --> 02:36.360
IT SOUNDS LIKE RUNNING WATER.

02:37.700 --> 02:38.740
&lt;SNIFFING&gt;

02:42.780 --> 02:45.200
TONYA! EXCUSE ME,
BABE, I'M WITH A CLIENT.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.370
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU WERE BRINGING FRIENDS.

02:47.410 --> 02:49.120
IS THAT...

02:49.170 --> 02:50.420
THE SMOKING GUN.

02:50.460 --> 02:52.590
-BRETT BABCOCK.
-YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH!

02:52.630 --> 02:54.130
SHE'S MY CLIENT.

02:54.170 --> 02:57.170
WELL, I THINK HE'S ALREADY
CLOSED THE DEAL.

03:00.340 --> 03:01.800
&lt;MUSIC PLAYING&gt;

03:05.810 --> 03:07.020
♪OH, YEAH♪

03:07.060 --> 03:08.060
♪YEAH♪

03:08.810 --> 03:09.940
♪OH, YEAH♪

03:09.980 --> 03:10.980

03:17.610 --> 03:20.360
♪OH, YEAH♪

03:20.410 --> 03:22.320
[BRETT] AW, YOU GOT A BAD
TRACK RECORD.
[TONYA] SHE'S MY CLIENT.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.740
[BRETT] YOU'RE TRYING
TO CLOSE... TONYA!

03:23.780 --> 03:25.030
JUST RELAX, B'Y.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.410
JUST RELAX.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

03:26.450 --> 03:28.960
UH, I JUST WALKED IN ON YOU
BANGING MY CLIENT, BRETT.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.290
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

03:30.330 --> 03:32.500
AH, SHE'S THE JEALOUS TYPE.
IT DRIVES ME.

03:32.540 --> 03:34.920
LISTEN, TONYA,
BUSINESS IS BUSINESS.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.840
SHE NEEDED AN AGENT WHO
COULD GET THE JOB DONE

03:36.880 --> 03:38.050
SO SHE CAME TO ME.

03:38.090 --> 03:39.920
BRETT BABCOCK,
THE SMOKING GUN.

03:40.550 --> 03:41.800
CLASSY.

03:41.840 --> 03:44.430
BRETT, ARE YOU TRYING TO
WRECK TONYA'S DEVELOPMENT?

03:44.470 --> 03:46.560
WHAT? NO, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.980
SO YOU WEREN'T PISSED WHEN
SHE CUT YOU OUT OF THE DEAL?

03:49.020 --> 03:50.270
THE WHOLE OCEAN'S POINT THING?

03:50.310 --> 03:52.270
&lt;LAUGHS&gt;
OCEAN POINT?

03:52.310 --> 03:54.310
THE CITY'S NEVER
GONNA LET THAT FLY.

03:54.360 --> 03:55.610
JUSTIN SLADE WILL SEE TO THAT.

03:55.650 --> 03:57.400
ISN'T HE RUNNING
AGAINST THE MAYOR?

03:57.440 --> 03:59.820
YEAH, AND GOD HELP
US ALL IF HE GETS IN.

03:59.860 --> 04:01.900
HE'S ANTI-DEVELOPMENT,
ALL THE WAY.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.240
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

04:03.280 --> 04:05.200
OH, RIGHT ON, B'Y.
ANOTHER SALE.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.160
LOOK AT THAT.
FELLAS, I GOTTA GO.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.830
IF YOU'RE LOOKIN' I GOT
GUYS WHO ARE SELLIN'.

04:09.870 --> 04:11.290
-THANK YOU.
-TONYA,

04:11.330 --> 04:13.290
BABE, IF YOU WANT
TO RUN WITH THE BULLS

04:13.330 --> 04:14.830
YOU GOTTA HAVE BALLS.

04:14.880 --> 04:15.880
&lt;CLICKS TONGUE&gt;

04:16.840 --> 04:17.880
DON'T MIND HIM.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.300
IF HE'S INVOLVED
WE'LL FIND OUT.

04:19.340 --> 04:21.760
I'LL DIG AROUND AND SEE
WHAT I CAN FIND ON HIM.

04:21.800 --> 04:25.510
ALL OF MY MONEY IN THE WORLD
IS TIED UP IN THIS DEAL.

04:25.550 --> 04:26.430
I COULD LOSE EVERYTHING.

04:26.470 --> 04:28.430
SO PLEASE JUST GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF IT.

04:28.470 --> 04:30.310
WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN.

04:30.350 --> 04:31.430
SEE YOU LATER.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.440
GIVE ME THAT.

04:37.520 --> 04:40.490
[MAYOR] JUSTIN SLADE?
HE'S A JOKE.
HE'S AN OPPORTUNIST.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.530
IF PEOPLE LIKE HIM

04:41.570 --> 04:43.650
HAD THEIR WAY THIS TOWN
WOULD NEVER MOVE FORWARD.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.530
YEAH, BUT HE DOES MAKE
AN INTERESTING POINT.

04:45.570 --> 04:48.870
I MEAN, WE DON'T WANT THIS
TOWN LOOKING LIKE
A STRIP MALL, DO WE?

04:48.910 --> 04:50.790
-WHAT?
-I'M JUST SAYING.
IT'S A SPECIAL PLACE.

04:50.830 --> 04:51.870
WE DON'T WANT TO RUIN IT.

04:51.910 --> 04:53.370
DON'T YOU START ON THAT, OKAY?

04:53.410 --> 04:55.790
I NEED YOU 100%
ON MY SIDE HERE.

04:55.830 --> 04:58.420
PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO THIS
GUY AND IT'S STARTING TO SHOW
IN THE POLLS.

04:58.460 --> 04:59.880
SO YOU JUST...

04:59.920 --> 05:02.300
YOU JUST CAN'T SAY THOSE
THINGS OUTSIDE THESE WALLS,
ALL RIGHT?

05:02.340 --> 05:04.010
CONSIDER ME MUZZLED.

05:04.050 --> 05:06.300
LOOK, I DIDN'T
MEAN IT LIKE THAT.

05:07.300 --> 05:09.100
LOOK, I JUST...

05:09.140 --> 05:10.520
I NEED MORE

05:10.560 --> 05:13.520
LESLIE BENNETT THAN SERGEANT
BENNETT RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

05:13.560 --> 05:15.900
OKAY. I JUST WANT YOU TO
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE BACKING.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.360
I DO. I DO KNOW.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.570
IT IS... IT'S STILL...
IT'S GONNA BE SPECIAL,
OKAY?

05:20.610 --> 05:21.440
OKAY.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.110
[DES] THE SMOKING GUN.

05:23.150 --> 05:24.740
BRETT BABCOCK.

05:24.780 --> 05:28.070
NO RECORD ON THIS GUY, BUT HIS
FINANCES ARE IN A BIT OF A DIP
SINCE THE DIVORCE.

05:28.120 --> 05:31.200
YOU KNOW, SOME MEN
UNDERESTIMATE THE LOVE OF
A GOOD WOMAN.

05:31.240 --> 05:32.370
IS YOUR HAIR SINGED?

05:32.410 --> 05:34.830
WHAT? NO. NO.
A LITTLE MAYBE.

05:34.870 --> 05:37.290
IT WAS JUST LIKE A LOVE BITE,
BUT WITH FIRE.

05:38.750 --> 05:41.090
-WHO'S THIS GUY?
-THIS IS JUSTIN SLADE.

05:41.130 --> 05:42.670
YEAH, HE'S THE
CITY'S NEW SAVIOR.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.220
-OR SO HE CLAIMS.
-YES.

05:44.260 --> 05:46.590
HE WAS A BIT OF AN ACTIVIST
IN HIS UNIVERSITY DAYS.

05:46.630 --> 05:49.470
THREW A PIE AT A
POLITICIAN'S FACE AND UH,

05:49.510 --> 05:52.470
GOT ARRESTED A COUPLE OF TIMES
FOR DISTURBING THE PEACE,
THAT SORT OF THING.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.600
REALLY? LET'S GO TALK TO HIM.

05:54.640 --> 05:57.480
A MAYORAL CANDIDATE SABOTAGING
A LAND DEVELOPMENT?

05:57.520 --> 05:58.770
WELL, YOU KNOW, STRANGER...

06:00.060 --> 06:01.570
...THINGS HAVE HAPPENED.

06:02.900 --> 06:04.900
LET'S GO. SEE YOU, ROSE.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.700
YEAH. SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

06:07.740 --> 06:09.870
&lt;GRUNTS&gt;
IT'S A GOOD CASE.

06:09.910 --> 06:11.410
ANOTHER DAY AT THE GRINDSTONE.

06:11.450 --> 06:13.660
WANT ME TO RUN OUT FOR
A COFFEE? TEA? COFFEE?

06:13.700 --> 06:15.290
TEA? COFFEE?

06:15.330 --> 06:16.660
-YOU DECIDE.
-I'LL PICK.

06:17.790 --> 06:18.880
COFFEE.

06:22.920 --> 06:27.090
SO YOU THINK I'M TRYING TO
DESTROY TONYA ST. CROIX'S
REAL ESTATE BUSINESS?

06:27.130 --> 06:28.510
THINK THAT'D BE
A SMART MOVE BY ME?

06:28.550 --> 06:30.340
IT'S NO SECRET YOU'RE
AGAINST OCEAN POINT.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.760
AND YOU DO HAVE A HISTORY OF
TAKING THINGS
INTO YOUR OWN HANDS.

06:32.810 --> 06:35.430
LOOK, I APPLAUD WHOEVER'S
TRYING TO STOP THAT WOMAN.

06:35.470 --> 06:38.850
AND I WILL PUT AN END TO THIS
TRAVESTY SHE'S TRYING
TO BUILD, BELIEVE ME.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.480
OH, YEAH?
HOW DO YOU PLAN ON DOING THAT?

06:40.520 --> 06:42.520
THROUGH LEGAL AND
POLITICAL CHANNELS.

06:43.020 --> 06:44.610
HAVE A LOOK AT THIS.

06:44.650 --> 06:46.740
HERE'S WHAT THE SOUTH SIDE
HILLS LOOKS LIKE RIGHT NOW.

06:46.780 --> 06:49.610
HERE'S WHAT IT WILL LOOK LIKE
IF MISS ST. CROIX
GETS HER WAY.

06:49.660 --> 06:52.620
-WOW.
-SO YOU CAN SEE WHY I'M
RUNNING FOR MAYOR.

06:52.660 --> 06:54.700
SOMEONE NEEDS
TO PRESERVE THIS TOWN.

06:54.740 --> 06:56.620
MAYOR CLARKE HAS
HIS OWN AGENDA.

06:56.660 --> 06:58.250
THANK YOU FOR
YOUR TIME AND, UH,

06:58.290 --> 06:59.460
GOOD LUCK WITH THE CAMPAIGN.

06:59.500 --> 07:00.420
THANK YOU.

07:02.340 --> 07:04.460
YOU'RE A PRIVATE EYE,
RIGHT, DETECTIVE?

07:04.500 --> 07:06.010
-YEAH.
-I'VE GOT SOMETHING.

07:06.050 --> 07:09.010
I MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING PEOPLE
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
ABOUT MAYOR CLARKE.

07:09.050 --> 07:10.130
IS THAT RIGHT?

07:10.180 --> 07:12.550
THERE'S MORE TO THIS
WHOLE OCEAN POINT THING.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.560
I COULD USE A P.I.
TO HELP ME CRACK IT OPEN.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.520
IF YOU THINK I CAN HELP,
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME A CALL?

07:20.350 --> 07:21.480
SEE YOU AROUND.

07:21.520 --> 07:22.560
WHAT WAS THAT?

07:23.520 --> 07:24.770
NOTHING.

07:29.570 --> 07:30.780
[JAKE] SO THIS IS IT, EH?

07:30.820 --> 07:33.570
THIS IS WHAT ALL THE
FUSS IS ABOUT.

07:33.620 --> 07:36.040
CAN SEE WHY PEOPLE
WOULD WANT THE VIEW.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.580
TOO BAD IT WRECKS THINGS
FOR THE REST OF THE TOWN.

07:38.620 --> 07:41.170
ALL OF THE SURVEY STICKS
WERE YANKED OUT OVERNIGHT.

07:41.210 --> 07:44.460
THREE OF THE TRUCK ENTRANCES
WERE SABOTAGED AND THE TRAILER
WAS BROKEN INTO.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.710
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T HELP
BUT WONDER, MAYBE PEOPLE
JUST DON'T WANT THIS.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.510
YOU CAN'T STOP PROGRESS.

07:49.550 --> 07:51.630
AND IF WE DIDN'T DO IT,
SOMEBODY ELSE WOULD.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.510
AND, IN OUR DEFENSE,

07:53.550 --> 07:56.680
WE ARE PRESERVING AS MUCH OF
THE CULTURAL INTEGRITY
OF THIS SITE AS POSSIBLE.

07:57.970 --> 07:59.520
RIGHT. WELL,

07:59.560 --> 08:01.560
IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'M JUST
GONNA HAVE A LOOK AROUND.

08:02.310 --> 08:04.110
OF COURSE. FEEL FREE.

08:05.820 --> 08:08.400
SHOULDN'T YOU BE TAKING
FINGERPRINTS OR SOMETHING?

08:15.780 --> 08:16.530
&lt;EXHALES&gt;

08:26.590 --> 08:27.750
REAL ESTATE LEADS.

08:39.270 --> 08:40.730
THIS THING IS GONNA
BE UGLY.

08:47.190 --> 08:49.150
WILLIAM CADIGAN CLARKE.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.110
THE MAYOR'S BOUGHT
PROPERTY HERE?

08:53.570 --> 08:56.660
WILLIAM CADIGAN CLARKE
GOES BACK ON THE BOARD.

08:58.030 --> 08:59.660
TAKING A BIT OF A LEAP THERE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

08:59.700 --> 09:02.330
HE'S INVOLVED SOMEHOW,
I KNOW IT.

09:02.370 --> 09:04.920
-ROSE?
-OKAY. WELL,
IT'S TOTALLY LEGIT.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.750
STANDARD FINANCING PLAN.

09:06.790 --> 09:08.840
CLARKE BOUGHT ONE OF
THE UNITS, BUT THERE'S NOTHING
ILLEGAL ABOUT IT.

09:08.880 --> 09:12.800
NO, NOTHING ILLEGAL, BUT IT
STILL MEANS HE HAS A
VESTED INTEREST IN THIS

09:12.840 --> 09:14.550
EYESORE OF A CASH COW.

09:14.590 --> 09:16.470
I THINK YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
SOMETHING THAT'S MAYBE
JUST NOT THERE.

09:16.510 --> 09:18.800
I'M GONNA GO TALK TO
SOMEBODY THAT'S IN THE KNOW.

09:18.850 --> 09:19.930
I'LL CATCH UP
WITH TONYA LATER.

09:21.640 --> 09:24.600
I GUESS, UH, I'LL HEAD BACK
TO THE HOUSE.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.730
YOU KNOW, THROW A FEW
DELICATES IN THE WASHER THEN
MAYBE WE COULD RENT A MOVIE?

09:27.770 --> 09:28.940
NO.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.150
OKAY. OR WE COULD GO TO ONE.

09:32.190 --> 09:35.450
OH, THERE'S A DEADLY NEW ONE
ABOUT THIS GUY WHO'S HALF
WOLF, HALF DOLPHIN, WOLFIN.

09:35.490 --> 09:38.620
NOW, I'M NOT USUALLY ONE FOR
ROMANTIC COMEDIES BUT THIS
LOOKS REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

09:38.660 --> 09:40.830
-IT SOUNDS REALLY GREAT.
-NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.

09:40.870 --> 09:43.250
-ME AND ROSE NEED SOME MORE
ALONE TIME.
-YEAH.

09:43.290 --> 09:44.750
WELL, OH, THAT'S GREAT.

09:44.790 --> 09:46.620
THEN ME AND TINNY CAN FOLLOW
THE SMOKING GUN,
BRETT BABCOCK.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.830
-OKAY.
-OKAY?

09:48.880 --> 09:53.420
BUT JUST NOTE, YOU KNOW, WHERE
HE GOES, WHAT HE DOES.
AND DON'T TALK TO HIM.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.220
OH, GOSH,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

09:55.260 --> 09:58.050
TWO TEENAGERS IN THE HOUSE
IS LIKE LETTING A STORM LOOSE.

09:58.090 --> 09:59.800
THEY'VE BEEN GETTING
PRETTY CHUMMY LATELY.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.720
I CAN TELL BY THE WAY
SHE BEATS ON HIM.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.020
DO YOU THINK WE NEED
TO HAVE A CHAT WITH THEM?

10:04.060 --> 10:06.100
WOULDN'T HURT.

10:06.140 --> 10:08.350
IS IT EVER GONNA JUST
BE YOU AND ME?

10:08.400 --> 10:10.730
I'LL JUST BE HAPPY IF WE DON'T
ADD TO THE TOTAL WE GOT.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.160
&lt;SIGHS&gt; NO, NO, NO. COME ON,
LESLIE. PLEASE COME BACK.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.870
LESLIE.

10:22.910 --> 10:26.120
PLEASE. I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.
IT'S IMPORTANT.

10:26.160 --> 10:28.460
AND I KNOW WHATEVER YOU SAY IS
GONNA RUIN MY DAY SOMEHOW,

10:28.500 --> 10:29.710
SO WHY DON'T YOU
GET IT OVER WITH?

10:30.840 --> 10:32.840
ARE YOU AWARE THAT YOUR
BOYFRIEND, THE MAYOR,

10:32.880 --> 10:35.590
HAS INVESTED IN PROPERTY AT
OCEAN POINT DEVELOPMENT SITE?

10:36.720 --> 10:38.260
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

10:38.300 --> 10:40.890
I SAW HIS NAME ON A CONTRACT
IN THE MOBILE TRAILER
AT THE SITE.

10:40.930 --> 10:42.970
WELL, THAT DOESN'T MEAN
HE'S DOING ANYTHING WRONG.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.680
WELL, IT DOESN'T EXACTLY
LOOK GOOD, LESLIE.

10:47.520 --> 10:50.060
JAKE, HONESTLY, I DON'T THINK
THIS IS YOUR CONCERN.

10:50.100 --> 10:51.810
SO I THINK YOU SHOULD
BACK OFF.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.690
-WELL, I THOUGHT MAYBE THAT
YOU'D WANT TO KNOW.
-&lt;CELL PHONE BEEPS&gt;

10:56.400 --> 10:58.240
WHATEVER. I GOTTA GO ANYWAY.

10:58.280 --> 11:00.280
YEAH, GREAT. YEAH.

11:14.710 --> 11:17.050
-&lt;BANGS ON TABLE&gt; DES!
-&lt;GASPS&gt;

11:17.090 --> 11:18.880
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
-WELL,

11:18.920 --> 11:21.840
TO PREPARE FOR A STAKEOUT
ONE MUST BE PREPARED.

11:21.890 --> 11:25.770
FOR EXAMPLE, I'M LOOKING FOR
INTEL ON ONE BRETT BABCOCK,
REAL ESTATE AGENT.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.350
-STAKEOUT.
-MMM-HMM.

11:27.390 --> 11:28.890
WHAT STAKEOUT ARE

11:28.930 --> 11:29.810
THE ONE YOU AND
I ARE GONNA DO.

11:29.850 --> 11:31.020
NOT A CHANCE.

11:32.810 --> 11:35.150
THERE'S 40 BUCKS IN IT
FOR YOU IF YOU COOPERATE.

11:35.190 --> 11:36.610
-50.
-DONE.

11:36.650 --> 11:38.280
BUT JUST FOR THE RECORD,
I WOULD HAVE GONE TO 60.

11:38.780 --> 11:39.860
60, THEN.

11:41.240 --> 11:44.080
WELL PLAYED, TINNY DOYLE.
WELL PLAYED.

11:46.370 --> 11:49.790
UH, SOME THINGS
ARE BEST LEFT UNSAID.

11:49.830 --> 11:52.420

NEIGHBORHOOD, OKAY?

11:52.460 --> 11:54.210
EXCELLENT, GO...

HEY. HEY.

11:56.130 --> 11:57.960
LOOK, MY DAY JUST
GOT A WHOLE LOT BETTER.

11:58.010 --> 11:59.130
HI. HI.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.970
BILL, I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

12:02.010 --> 12:03.260
YOU'RE SO SERIOUS.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.510
I'LL CATCH YOU LATER, OKAY?
GIVE ME FIVE?

12:06.560 --> 12:07.890
THANKS.

12:07.930 --> 12:10.850
DO YOU OWN PROPERTY ON THAT
NEW DEVELOPMENT, OCEAN POINT?

12:10.890 --> 12:12.520
WHAT?

12:12.560 --> 12:13.980
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

12:14.020 --> 12:14.980
JAKE CAME ACROSS YOUR NAME.

12:15.020 --> 12:16.900
HE'S WORKING A CASE
FOR TONYA ST. CROIX.

12:19.360 --> 12:20.820
SO IT'S TRUE?

12:20.860 --> 12:22.450
WHERE DID HE SEE
THIS INFORMATION?

12:22.490 --> 12:24.740
AT THE BUILDING SITE
IN THE PORTABLE OFFICE.

12:26.490 --> 12:28.620
WELL, LEAVE IT TO
JAKE DOYLE TO RUIN IT THEN.

12:28.660 --> 12:29.700
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

12:29.750 --> 12:30.870
THE SURPRISE.

12:30.910 --> 12:33.000
LOOK, DON'T WORRY.

12:33.040 --> 12:34.880
IT'S ALL ON THE UP AND UP.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.040
I BOUGHT IT AFTER
THE APPROVAL AND

12:37.090 --> 12:40.630
I KNOW IT LOOKS LIKE A SLIGHT
CONFLICT OF INTEREST,

12:40.670 --> 12:42.970
BUT BELIEVE ME, THE COUNCIL
KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT.

12:43.010 --> 12:44.590
WELL, WHY ARE YOU
BUYING UP THERE?

12:44.640 --> 12:46.510
WELL, WHY DO YOU THINK?

12:47.470 --> 12:48.970
IT'S FOR US.

12:49.770 --> 12:50.810
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

13:01.070 --> 13:01.940
HELLO?

13:01.990 --> 13:03.320
[ALLISON] HELLO.

13:03.900 --> 13:04.950
HI.

13:06.120 --> 13:07.950
UH, WHAT THE HELL IS ALL THIS?

13:07.990 --> 13:09.580
COURTESY OF MY EX.

13:09.620 --> 13:12.580
I GUESS YOU SCARED HIM SO BAD
THAT HE SENT ALL MY STUFF
FROM TORONTO.

13:12.620 --> 13:16.580
OBVIOUSLY HE HAS
A LOT TO LEARN IN THE
PACKING DEPARTMENT.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.340
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO WITH ALL THIS.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.090
IT'S A BIT MUCH.

13:20.130 --> 13:22.460
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, WITH MY
LIVING ARRANGEMENTS AND
ALL THIS STUFF NOW, I'M...

13:22.510 --> 13:24.970
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? THERE'S A
WICKED FLEA MARKET
IN THE AVALON MALL.

13:25.010 --> 13:28.720
WE COULD SELL IT FOR A PROFIT.

13:28.760 --> 13:30.310
THIS IS MY STUFF, JAKE.

13:30.350 --> 13:32.270
I'M SERIOUS.
THIS IS MY WHOLE LIFE.

13:32.310 --> 13:35.060
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
I'LL GET THE OLD MAN'S
PICKUP TRUCK,

13:35.100 --> 13:37.810
WE'LL THROW IT ALL IN THERE
AND FIND A PLACE TO
STICK THIS STUFF

13:37.860 --> 13:39.820
AT THE OFFICE OR THE BAR
OR SOMETHING, ALL RIGHT?

13:39.860 --> 13:41.320
THANK YOU.

13:41.360 --> 13:44.700
BUT I NEED TO GET A PLACE SOON
OR I'M GONNA LOSE MY MIND.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.070
MY OWN PLACE OR...

13:48.160 --> 13:49.950
-OR...
-OR...

13:50.580 --> 13:51.950
OKAY, SERIOUSLY,

13:51.990 --> 13:55.370
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT OUR NEXT STEP WOULD BE?

13:56.000 --> 13:57.040
MIGHT BE?

13:57.080 --> 13:58.290
WELL, YOU KNOW, ALLISON,

13:58.330 --> 14:00.340
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD, YOU
KNOW, JUST MOVE IN TOGETHER

14:00.380 --> 14:02.550
BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH LOOKING
FOR A PLACE TO LIVE, RIGHT?

14:02.590 --> 14:05.010
-YEAH, I KNOW. I... I'M...
-&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

14:05.420 --> 14:06.510
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;

14:06.550 --> 14:08.550
OH, IT'S DAD.
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET THIS.

14:08.590 --> 14:09.720
HE'S BEEN REALLY
DEPRESSED LATELY.

14:09.760 --> 14:10.930
HE'S RUNNING AROUND
HUGGING EVERYBODY.

14:13.140 --> 14:13.970
YEAH?

14:14.020 --> 14:15.390
JAKE, YOU BETTER
GET DOWN TO THE SITE.

14:15.430 --> 14:16.940
THINGS ARE HEATING UP.

14:16.980 --> 14:18.900
OKAY, I'M... I'M ON MY WAY.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.940
GOT TO GO. IT'S WORK, SO...

14:21.980 --> 14:25.240
HEY, BUT WE'LL...TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER.

14:25.740 --> 14:26.860
OKAY.

14:27.450 --> 14:28.740
ALL RIGHT.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.240
BYE.

14:35.080 --> 14:36.370
[SLADE] YOU'RE DESTROYING THE
FABRIC OF ST. JOHN'S

14:36.410 --> 14:37.960
WITH THIS MONSTROSITY
OF A DEVELOPMENT.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.750
NO. YOU HAVE NO
RIGHT TO BE HERE.

14:39.790 --> 14:41.210
WE HAVE APPROVAL BY COUNCIL.

14:41.250 --> 14:43.000
THE CURRENT CITY
COUNCIL'S A JOKE.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.090
WELL, THIS IS JUST A CHEAP
WAY TO SCAM A FEW VOTES.

14:45.130 --> 14:46.050
HEY. WHOA. WHOA.

14:46.090 --> 14:48.010
OKAY, EVERYONE JUST
CALM DOWN HERE, ALL RIGHT?

14:48.050 --> 14:51.640
I'M SURE WE CAN COME TO A VERY
HAPPY RESOLUTION,
NON-VIOLENTLY.

14:51.680 --> 14:54.100
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.
I AM CALLING THE POLICE.

14:54.140 --> 14:55.430
HEY, HANG ON.

14:55.470 --> 14:57.270
WHY ARE YOU AFRAID TO HAVE A
CALM, COOL DISCUSSION
ABOUT THIS?

14:57.310 --> 14:58.310
GO TO HELL.

15:01.610 --> 15:03.020
DO YOU SMELL THAT?

15:03.070 --> 15:04.230
GAS.

15:05.570 --> 15:06.610
IT'S COMING FROM...

15:06.650 --> 15:07.650
FROM THE TRAILER!

15:09.860 --> 15:11.240
UH-OH. DAD.

15:11.910 --> 15:12.990
TONYA!

15:13.030 --> 15:14.450
YOU PEOPLE, FOLLOW ME.

15:14.490 --> 15:16.000
QUICKLY. QUICKLY. QUICKLY.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.250
EVERYBODY GET DOWN!

15:29.430 --> 15:30.840
OH, MY GOD!

15:30.880 --> 15:32.010
OH, MY GOD!

15:33.470 --> 15:34.930
COME ON.

15:40.980 --> 15:44.690
IT'S UNFORTUNATE WHAT HAPPENED
TODAY, BUT I ASSURE YOU I
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

15:44.730 --> 15:46.730
WE GOT AN EYEWITNESS

15:46.780 --> 15:49.490
WHO SAYS YOU WERE SEEN LEAVING
THAT TRAILER A FEW HOURS AGO
WITH SOME DOCUMENTS.

15:49.530 --> 15:52.070
WHAT EYEWITNESS?
THEN CHARGE ME.

15:52.110 --> 15:56.080
THERE WAS A PILOT LIGHT THAT
WENT OUT IN ONE OF THE
TWO HEATERS IN THAT TRAILER.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.410
THERE WAS A SLOW GAS LEAK...

15:57.450 --> 15:59.910
THIS IS AN INTERESTING WAY TO
KEEP TABS ON THE COMPETITION.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.080
I'M HERE TO SURPRISE LESLIE.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.500
SO LESLIE DOESN'T KNOW
THAT YOU'RE WATCHING AN

16:03.540 --> 16:06.710
INTERROGATION OF THE GUY WHO'S
ACTUALLY TRYING TO
STEAL YOUR JOB?

16:06.750 --> 16:10.670
I'M NOT A LAWYER OR A COP,
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THAT
THIS IS WRONG.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.430
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'VE HAD IT WITH YOUR,

16:12.470 --> 16:15.010
YOUR INTEREST IN LESLIE AND
I DON'T LIKE THE HEAD GAMES

16:15.050 --> 16:16.180
THAT YOU PLAY WITH HER.

16:16.220 --> 16:19.060
I'M THE ONE WHO'S PLAYING
HEAD GAMES? RIGHT.

16:19.100 --> 16:20.890
LISTEN, UH, CADIGAN,

16:20.930 --> 16:22.900
YOU'RE DIRTY AND
I'M GONNA PROVE IT.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.110
-IS THAT RIGHT?
-MMM-HMM. YOU SEE,

16:25.150 --> 16:27.730
I'LL KEEP PEELING
BACK THE LAYERS

16:27.780 --> 16:31.200
UNTIL I GET TO THE SMELLY
ROTTED CORE THAT IS YOU.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.780
IT'S TOO BAD YOU DON'T TAKE
THE SAME INTEREST IN YOUR OWN
GIRLFRIEND AS YOU DO IN MINE.

16:34.820 --> 16:37.080
BECAUSE THAT MUST BE REALLY,
REALLY HARD ON HER.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.120
&lt;DOOR OPENS&gt;

16:39.240 --> 16:40.750
HEY.

16:40.790 --> 16:41.830
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

16:41.870 --> 16:43.080
NOTHING.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.670
-WE WERE JUST HAVING
A LITTLE, UH, CHAT.
-YEP.

16:47.500 --> 16:48.800
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

16:53.550 --> 16:54.840
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

16:54.890 --> 16:56.970
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.

16:57.010 --> 16:58.060
I'LL SEE YOU WHEN I GET HOME.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.010
OKAY.

17:06.230 --> 17:07.520
[JAKE] HEY.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.940
WHERE'S TONYA?

17:09.440 --> 17:10.980
SHE'S IN THE SHOWER.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.490
SAID SHE FELT DIRTY.

17:12.530 --> 17:15.110
DIDN'T STOP HER FROM TRYING
TO SELL ME A CONDO, THOUGH.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.200
RIGHT.

17:16.240 --> 17:18.780
SO THE COPS THINK
IT WAS ARSON.

17:18.830 --> 17:22.000
WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM, UH,
BLOWING UP A TRAILER?

17:22.040 --> 17:23.870
BRETT BABCOCK?
HE'S A BUSY BOY.

17:23.910 --> 17:27.210
SEEMS HE'S GOT A DOZEN OR SO
INVESTORS LINED UP IN CASE
TONYA GOES UNDER.

17:27.250 --> 17:31.170
-SHE LOSES THE PROPERTY...
-BRETT SWOOPS IN, PICKS IT UP
AT BANKRUPTCY PRICES.

17:31.210 --> 17:33.170
&lt;WATER POUNDING IN SHOWER&gt;

17:33.220 --> 17:34.300
YES, JAKE.

17:34.340 --> 17:35.930
THERE IS A GIRL IN THE SHOWER.

17:35.970 --> 17:38.300
UH, DON'T LOOK AT ME
LIKE THAT, ALL RIGHT? I...

17:38.350 --> 17:41.140
I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND
SO LET'S JUST MOVE ON.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.310
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:43.350 --> 17:45.480
I STILL THINK THE MAYOR
IS INVOLVED IN ALL OF THIS.

17:45.520 --> 17:47.440
YOU'RE REALLY OBSESSED
WITH THIS MAYOR THING.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.310
I'M NOT OBSESSED. LOOK, UGH,

17:49.360 --> 17:50.900
WHAT THE HELL DO
YOU KNOW, ANYWAY?

17:50.940 --> 17:52.110
-ALL RIGHT?
-&lt;SIGHS&gt;

17:54.360 --> 17:55.740
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

17:57.490 --> 17:59.450
-HI.
-HI.

18:00.870 --> 18:02.540
ARE WE ALONE?

18:02.580 --> 18:04.750
YES, WE ARE ALONE.

18:04.790 --> 18:07.120
MY DAD, HE JUST, UH,
STEPPED OUT TO GET A...

18:07.170 --> 18:08.290
GOOD.

18:12.340 --> 18:15.220
UH, HOW ARE YOU?

18:15.260 --> 18:18.470
AFTER THE EXPLOSION YOU
MUST BE IN SHOCK OR...

18:18.510 --> 18:20.800
I FEEL MUCH BETTER.

18:21.890 --> 18:23.020
THAT'S GOOD.

18:23.060 --> 18:26.230
SO THIS IS WHERE
YOU'RE LIVING.

18:27.350 --> 18:28.600
YEAH.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.770
YOU KNOW, I THINK WE CAN DO
MUCH BETTER THAN THIS,
DON'T YOU?

18:30.810 --> 18:32.360
-I KIND OF LIKE HERE...
-&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

18:32.400 --> 18:34.190
OH, EXCUSE ME...

18:34.230 --> 18:36.240
THAT'S MY PHONE. PARDON ME.

18:36.990 --> 18:38.200
-HEY.
-HELLO.

18:38.240 --> 18:40.410
-DID YOU GET YOUR DAD'S TRUCK?
-UH, NO.

18:40.450 --> 18:42.580
I DIDN'T GET A TRUCK.

18:42.620 --> 18:47.870
I'M ACTUALLY WITH A, UM, REAL
ESTATE AGENT AT THE,
AT THE MOMENT.

18:47.920 --> 18:50.710
WOW. THAT'S QUITE
THE TURNAROUND.

18:50.750 --> 18:53.340
ALLISON, I SHOULD TELL
YOU THIS IS A...

18:53.380 --> 18:55.050
A... SHE'S A CLIENT.

18:55.340 --> 18:57.300
A CLIENT.

18:57.340 --> 18:58.470
YEAH, THAT'S FINE.

18:58.510 --> 19:02.100
I'M YANKING YOUR CHAIN,
JAKE, MOSTLY.

19:02.140 --> 19:05.270
WELL, GIVE HER MY NAME
BECAUSE I NEED A PLACE.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.480
I'LL CALL YOU LATER. BYE.

19:07.520 --> 19:12.310
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT
A PLACE FOR YOU AND
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

19:13.860 --> 19:15.530
WITH A VIEW, MAYBE?

19:18.530 --> 19:20.740
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:20.780 --> 19:23.030
THEY DON'T CALL ME
"THE CLOSER" FOR NOTHING.

19:24.410 --> 19:30.210
YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THIS IS
A LITTLE TOO MUCH EVEN FOR ME.

19:30.250 --> 19:32.130
-WELL, FINE. WE'LL DISCUSS
DETAILS LATER.
-&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

19:32.170 --> 19:34.170
WHY DON'T YOU TELL
ME ABOUT THE MAYOR?

19:34.210 --> 19:35.460
HMM, CLARKE?

19:35.500 --> 19:37.380
HE BOUGHT PROPERTY
FROM YOU, DIDN'T HE?

19:37.420 --> 19:40.130
-CONFIDENTIALITY.
-&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

19:40.180 --> 19:43.850
BUT I DO HAVE A LOT OF
INFLUENTIAL CLIENTS LINED UP
TO BUY.

19:43.890 --> 19:45.720
-OR I DID.
-RIGHT.

19:45.760 --> 19:48.100
OH, YOU KNOW, THIS FIRE COULD
NOT HAVE COME AT A WORSE TIME.

19:48.140 --> 19:51.650
THE SITE IS SHUT DOWN,
I'VE LOST ALL MY CLIENT FILES

19:51.690 --> 19:54.440
AND IT'S GONNA TAKE ME
WEEKS TO GET ALL OF THIS
STRAIGHTENED OUT.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.980
YOU KNOW, I REALLY SHOULD
TAKE THIS ONE IN PRIVATE.

19:58.780 --> 19:59.950
LIKE NOW. &lt;CHUCKLES&gt;

19:59.990 --> 20:01.820
-SO...
-BE MY GUEST.

20:05.330 --> 20:06.410
GO FOR TONYA.

20:08.580 --> 20:12.790
SO, HERE WE ARE,
YOU AND ME, ON SURVEILLANCE.

20:12.830 --> 20:14.670
&lt;SIGHS&gt; GOOD TIMES.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.460
YOU WANT A SNACK?

20:18.510 --> 20:20.880
I MADE SOME PATE.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.140
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M ACTUALLY GOOD.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.260
-YOU ARE?
-YEAH.

20:24.300 --> 20:25.680
-OKAY.
-THANKS.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.220
ARE YOU TOO HOT?
ARE YOU TOO COLD?
YOU'RE PROBABLY TOO COLD.

20:27.260 --> 20:28.390
HERE, I'LL TURN THIS ON.

20:29.640 --> 20:31.850
OH, MY GOD. OW!

20:31.890 --> 20:33.350
THE DUST, B'Y.
TURN IT OFF!

20:35.360 --> 20:37.980
HERE, LET ME SEE IT. LET ME
SEE IT. I'M TRAINED, OKAY?

20:38.030 --> 20:39.610
-BE CAREFUL.
-LET ME SEE.

20:40.530 --> 20:41.900
OKAY.

20:41.950 --> 20:43.320
I DON'T REALLY...

20:43.360 --> 20:44.910
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

20:44.950 --> 20:46.410
REALLY?

20:46.450 --> 20:48.950
IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.410
TARGET'S ON THE MOVE!

20:52.460 --> 20:54.080
-WHAT?
-TARGET'S ON THE MOVE.

20:55.670 --> 20:57.000
TARGET HAS A CHAINSAW.
OH, MY GOD.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.460
HE'S GONNA CUT DOWN
THE HOUSE OR PEOPLE.

20:58.500 --> 20:59.710
OH, MY GOD, CAN HE
CUT DOWN PEOPLE?

20:59.760 --> 21:00.960
WE GOTTA GET A
BETTER LOOK AT THAT.

21:01.010 --> 21:02.340
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

21:02.380 --> 21:03.760
WE GOTTA CALL MAL AND JAKE
AND THEN WE DO
THE WEDDING DATE.

21:03.800 --> 21:05.090
I MEAN, &lt;STUTTERS&gt;
WE GOTTA WAIT.

21:05.140 --> 21:06.300
I MEAN, WE GOTTA
DO THE WAITING...

21:06.340 --> 21:07.390
WHATEVER. WE GOTTA
CALL MAL AND JAKE.

21:07.430 --> 21:08.850
THE DUDE HAS A CHAINSAW.

21:08.890 --> 21:10.970
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TURNING
INTO A TAKE-CHARGE
KIND OF GUY, DES.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.850
I AM. I AM. BUT MORE IN THE
LET'S-WAIT-FOR-HELP
KIND OF MANNER.

21:13.890 --> 21:15.520
DON'T WAIT FOR ORDERS.

21:15.560 --> 21:18.020
JUST GO FOR IT WHEN THE
OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS ITSELF.

21:29.450 --> 21:30.620
LIKE THAT?

21:30.660 --> 21:32.410
THE JOB, DES.

21:32.450 --> 21:34.540
I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE JOB.

21:34.580 --> 21:36.170
LET'S ROLL.

21:36.210 --> 21:39.460
UNLESS, UH, YOU WANT TO STAY
HERE 'CAUSE THAT WOULD
BE COOL, TOO.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.090
NO. LET'S GO.

21:54.770 --> 21:57.310
DES.

21:57.350 --> 21:59.560
OH, IT'S SO GOOD HOW SOME
PEOPLE WON'T LET OTHERS DRINK
AND DRIVE.

21:59.610 --> 22:01.730
I DON'T KNOW, DES.

22:01.780 --> 22:03.530
THIS IS ALL WRONG.

22:03.570 --> 22:05.570
-&lt;WOMAN SCREAMING&gt;
-&lt;CHAINSAW REVVING&gt;

22:05.610 --> 22:06.950
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.

22:06.990 --> 22:08.200
HE'S KILLING SOMEONE IN THERE.

22:09.160 --> 22:10.330
DES, DON'T!

22:12.450 --> 22:13.450
&lt;EXCLAIMING&gt;

22:18.830 --> 22:20.380
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

22:30.300 --> 22:31.720
&lt;CAR HORN HONKING&gt;

22:43.150 --> 22:45.240
-HOW YOU MAKING OUT?
-OH!

22:46.950 --> 22:48.820
-DID YOU FIND ANYTHING?
-WHAT, ARE YOU
FOLLOWING ME NOW?

22:48.860 --> 22:51.120
I ALWAYS HATE BEING
INTERRUPTED IN THE MIDDLE
OF A BREAK-IN.

22:51.160 --> 22:52.740
-MY APOLOGIES.
-HEY, LOOK. I KNOW,

22:52.780 --> 22:54.620
I KNOW IT LOOKS BAD,
BUT JUSTIN'S

22:54.660 --> 22:56.540
GONNA LAUNCH A SMEAR
CAMPAIGN AGAINST ME WITH,

22:56.580 --> 22:58.040
WITH FALSE DOCUMENTS.

22:58.080 --> 23:00.670
SO I JUST WANT TO SEE HIS PLAN
OF ACTION SO I CAN
AT LEAST DEFEND MYSELF.

23:00.710 --> 23:01.840
I KNOW YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.960
PLEASE DON'T TREAT ME
LIKE I'M ONE.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.210
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

23:06.760 --> 23:08.130
I'VE JUST HAD IT WITH YOU.

23:10.550 --> 23:11.510
&lt;GRUNTS&gt;

23:11.550 --> 23:12.930
OH, SO IT'S LIKE THAT.

23:13.930 --> 23:16.060
OH! AHH!

23:16.100 --> 23:17.850
STOP BEING SUCH A SOOK.
GET UP.

23:17.890 --> 23:18.940
OH, MY HEAD.

23:18.980 --> 23:21.060
HEY! TELL ME WHAT
YOU'RE DOING HERE.

23:27.690 --> 23:30.570
I'VE WANTED TO DO
THAT FOR A LONG TIME.

23:33.910 --> 23:34.910
&lt;GROANS&gt;

23:39.500 --> 23:40.500
&lt;THUD&gt;

23:42.210 --> 23:46.420
SO FAR, ALL WE'VE CAUGHT YOUNG
BRETT DOING IS CLOSING DEALS,
SO TO SPEAK.

23:46.460 --> 23:48.090
BUT HE STILL HAS A MOTIVE
FOR BRINGING DOWN TONYA.

23:48.130 --> 23:50.510
LOOK, FORGET ABOUT BRETT,
THE SMOKING GUN, OKAY?

23:50.550 --> 23:54.100
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHY THE
MAYOR WAS BREAKING INTO
JUSTIN'S OFFICE.

23:54.140 --> 23:55.680
WELL, MAYBE JUSTIN DOES
HAVE SOME DIRT ON HIM.

23:55.720 --> 23:57.770
OR MAYBE IT'S JUST
DIRTY POLITICS.

23:57.810 --> 24:00.440
&lt;SIGHS&gt;
THE MAYOR IS INVOLVED.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.520
I KNOW IT, OKAY.
HE IS INVOLVED.

24:02.560 --> 24:04.480
JAKE, WHAT DO YOU
WANT US TO DO HERE?

24:06.070 --> 24:08.110
WE CAN GO DOWN THIS PATH
WITH YOU IF YOU WANT,

24:08.150 --> 24:11.490
BUT I REALLY BELIEVE YOU'RE
LETTING YOUR FEELINGS FOR
LESLIE GET IN THE WAY HERE.

24:11.530 --> 24:12.700
I CAN PROVE THIS.

24:12.740 --> 24:14.570
WHY WOULD THE MAYOR BE TRYING
TO DESTROY OCEAN POINT

24:14.620 --> 24:16.580
WHEN HE'S ACTUALLY PUBLICLY
SUPPORTING IT?

24:16.620 --> 24:18.160
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO
GIVE IT A REST, SON.

24:18.200 --> 24:19.660
I'M GETTING WORRIED
ABOUT YOU HERE.

24:19.700 --> 24:21.210
FINE, OKAY.

24:21.250 --> 24:23.080
-I'LL GIVE IT A REST.
-CHECK IN WITH TONYA.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.630
-I'LL LOOK INTO BRETT.
-ALL RIGHT.

24:25.670 --> 24:27.630
I KNOW HOW TO GET A GUY
LIKE THAT'S ATTENTION.

24:27.670 --> 24:28.510
&lt;BEEP&gt;

24:28.550 --> 24:30.090
SEE YOU LATER.

24:30.130 --> 24:31.130
&lt;DIALING&gt;

24:32.680 --> 24:34.260
HI.

24:34.300 --> 24:39.890
YES, I'D LIKE TO REQUEST A
BRETT BABCOCK FREE
SMOKING GUN APPRAISAL.

24:41.310 --> 24:42.310
&lt;KNOCKING&gt;

24:43.650 --> 24:46.310
SO YOU'RE AN EX-CON
CANDIDATE NOW?

24:46.900 --> 24:47.980
YOU'RE A SHOE-IN.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.610
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt;
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, JAKE?

24:50.650 --> 24:53.070
-HERE TO PICK UP SECRETS
FOR THE MAYOR?
-NO.

24:53.110 --> 24:57.030
I ACTUALLY CAME HERE TO TELL
YOU THAT I FOUND THE MAYOR
BREAKING INTO THIS OFFICE.

24:58.410 --> 25:00.250
RUSSELL, TAKE A BREAK.

25:01.450 --> 25:02.960
THANK YOU.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.670
UNBELIEVABLE.

25:04.710 --> 25:06.130
WE THOUGHT SOMETHING
HAPPENED LAST NIGHT,

25:06.170 --> 25:08.340
BUT I NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
THE MAYOR WOULD STOOP
THAT LOW.

25:08.380 --> 25:09.710
HE'S A REAL SLEVEEN, ISN'T HE?

25:09.750 --> 25:12.010
YEAH, HE CERTAINLY IS.

25:12.050 --> 25:14.340
YOU SHOULD CALL THE COPS.
I'LL GIVE A STATEMENT.

25:14.380 --> 25:16.720
-I MEAN, IF THAT MEANS
ANYTHING TO YOU.
-I SHOULD.

25:16.760 --> 25:20.350
I'LL JUST ADD IT TO MY LIST
OF THE MAYOR'S DIRTY DEALINGS.

25:20.390 --> 25:23.690
YOU KNOW, THE MAYOR, HE'S
BOUGHT PROPERTY
AT OCEAN POINT.

25:23.730 --> 25:25.100
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

25:25.150 --> 25:26.270
YEAH.

25:26.980 --> 25:28.900
I KNOW MORE THAN THAT.

25:28.940 --> 25:30.480
REALLY? CARE TO ENLIGHTEN ME?

25:30.530 --> 25:31.780
I'M JUST LOOKING
FOR THE TRUTH HERE.

25:31.820 --> 25:33.570
YEAH, I WILL, JAKE,
WHEN THE TIME'S RIGHT.

25:35.910 --> 25:38.450
THANKS FOR COMING.

25:38.490 --> 25:41.410
YOU KNOW, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I THINK YOU MIGHT MAKE
A DECENT MAYOR.

25:41.450 --> 25:42.790
MIGHT?

25:42.830 --> 25:44.750
WELL, I APPRECIATE
THE VOTE OF CONFIDENCE.

25:45.750 --> 25:47.170
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

25:49.040 --> 25:50.050
&lt;GROANS&gt;

25:51.760 --> 25:53.300
-[ALLISON] HEY, JAKE.
-HI.

25:53.340 --> 25:56.430
I GOT YOUR INVITE ABOUT
THE OPEN HOUSE.

25:56.470 --> 25:57.680
SOUNDS PROMISING.

25:57.720 --> 25:59.430
MY INVITE TO THE WHAT NOW?

25:59.470 --> 26:00.560
OH, COME ON.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.640

26:03.180 --> 26:04.390
MY AGENT?

26:04.430 --> 26:05.480
RIGHT.

26:05.520 --> 26:08.100
TONYA ST. CROIX.

26:08.150 --> 26:10.690
OKAY, SO DO YOU WANT TO MEET
ME THERE OR SHALL I
PICK YOU UP?

26:10.730 --> 26:11.730
&lt;CLICKS TONGUE&gt;

26:11.780 --> 26:14.530
WHATEVER YOU PREFER,
I GUESS, HONEY.

26:15.990 --> 26:18.780
[BRETT] I MUST SAY, LADIES,
I'VE REALLY ENJOYED
WHAT I'VE SEEN.

26:18.820 --> 26:20.700
AND THE HOUSE
ISN'T TOO BAD EITHER.

26:20.740 --> 26:22.040
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.950
YOU TWO ARE SISTERS, RIGHT?

26:24.000 --> 26:26.410

26:26.460 --> 26:29.080
-DO YOU THINK WE COULD GET
A FAIR PRICE?
-&lt;EXHALES&gt;

26:29.130 --> 26:31.630
TURN-OF-THE-CENTURY VICTORIAN
HOME IN THE HEART OF
THE DOWNTOWN METROPOLIS?

26:31.670 --> 26:33.050
YOU'LL DO MORE THAN FAIR.

26:33.090 --> 26:34.760
GREAT.

26:34.800 --> 26:38.130
-SO, UH...
-SO, WHY DON'T YOU SHOW ME
SOME MORE OF WHAT YOU GOT?

26:38.180 --> 26:39.970
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.
TAKE A LOOK AT SOME BEDROOMS.

26:41.810 --> 26:43.100
UH, SURE.

26:43.140 --> 26:44.180
-OKAY.
-THIS WAY.

26:44.220 --> 26:45.890
EXCELLENT. VERY EXCITING.

26:46.480 --> 26:47.810
AFTER YOU.

26:47.850 --> 26:49.190
NO, PLEASE, AFTER YOU.

26:49.230 --> 26:50.480
WHICHEVER.

26:50.520 --> 26:52.520

27:00.820 --> 27:02.080
NICE WORK, SON.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.450
WELL, JAKE USUALLY JUST
SCREAMS THE INSTRUCTIONS.

27:03.490 --> 27:04.740
THIS IS WAY BETTER.

27:06.700 --> 27:07.830
&lt;GRUNTING&gt;

27:07.870 --> 27:09.750
WOW!

27:09.790 --> 27:13.040
SOMETHING UNSETTLING ABOUT A
MAN THAT DRIVES AROUND
WITH GIANT SIGNS OF HIMSELF.

27:13.090 --> 27:15.050
WHAT ARE THESE?

27:15.090 --> 27:18.300
OH, I THINK IT'S WHAT REAL
ESTATE AGENTS CALL "LEADS."

27:18.340 --> 27:19.550
THEY COST A FORTUNE.

27:19.590 --> 27:21.180
THESE ARE ALL ADDRESSED
TO TONYA ST. CROIX.

27:21.220 --> 27:22.390
HERE, TAKE A PICTURE.

27:23.680 --> 27:25.720

ANYTHING TO BREAK THAT TRUST.

27:39.570 --> 27:41.740
-OKAY.
-GOOD.

27:41.780 --> 27:42.950
GLAD I MADE MYSELF CLEAR.

27:47.580 --> 27:49.250
[BRETT] IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE
MEETING YOU LADIES.

27:49.290 --> 27:51.540
GIVE ME A CALL WHEN
YOU'RE READY TO LIST.

27:51.580 --> 27:52.880
GIVE ME A CALL IF YOU

-YUCK, B'Y.
-I'LL SAY.

28:13.860 --> 28:14.940
HOLY SHIT.

28:14.980 --> 28:17.400
-WHAT IS IT?
-NOTHING. I HAVE TO GO.

28:17.440 --> 28:19.360
OH! AND STAY AWAY FROM DES.

28:23.570 --> 28:24.700
BILL?

28:27.200 --> 28:28.790
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
ON JUSTIN SLADE?

28:29.950 --> 28:31.160
I REALLY HAVE TO KNOW.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.580
BILL, ARE YOU ASKING ME TO
DIG UP DIRT ON YOUR OPPONENT?

28:33.630 --> 28:34.790
LESLIE, PLEASE.

28:34.830 --> 28:36.750
I... MAYORAL DEBATES
ARE COMING UP.

28:36.790 --> 28:38.210
I AM SLIPPING IN THE POLLS.

28:38.250 --> 28:41.840
ANYTHING YOU CAN GIVE ME ON
THIS GUY WOULD REALLY
SAVE ME RIGHT NOW.

28:41.880 --> 28:44.090
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO TELL ME?

28:44.140 --> 28:45.800
SOMETHING DOESN'T
FEEL RIGHT HERE.

28:45.850 --> 28:46.890
THERE'S NOTHING
SINISTER GOING ON.

28:46.930 --> 28:48.260
I'M TRYING TO WIN
AN ELECTION HERE.

28:48.310 --> 28:50.640
JUSTIN THINKS YOU'RE INVOLVED
IN SOMETHING UNETHICAL.

28:50.680 --> 28:52.850
AND WHATEVER IT IS HE'S GOING
TO DROP IT AT THE NEXT DEBATE.

28:52.890 --> 28:55.730
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL
COME CLEAN WITH ME.

28:55.770 --> 28:58.150
&lt;SCOFFS&gt;
I CAN'T SEEM TO CONVINCE YOU.

29:02.070 --> 29:04.780
I WISH YOU HAD AS MUCH FAITH
IN ME AS YOU DO IN JAKE DOYLE.

29:06.990 --> 29:08.240
I'M GOING TO GO FOR A DRIVE.

29:22.840 --> 29:25.050
[TONYA] SO EVERYTHING
CAN BE ORDERED CUSTOM.

29:25.090 --> 29:28.010
YOU WANT PURE MARBLE FLOORING
IN THE FRONT FOYER,
IT'S YOURS.

29:28.050 --> 29:29.180
-&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;
-OH, SORRY.

29:29.220 --> 29:30.640
EXCUSE ME.

29:31.890 --> 29:34.020
I THINK THIS PLACE
IS AMAZING, JAKE.

29:34.060 --> 29:38.190
YEAH, IT'S DEFINITELY,
YOU KNOW, HERE.

29:38.230 --> 29:40.070
MASTER BEDROOM
HAS A FIREPLACE.

29:40.110 --> 29:43.150
-&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;
-OH HEY, WHY DON'T YOU GO
TAKE A PEEK AT THAT.

29:43.190 --> 29:45.160
THINK DIRTY THOUGHTS, ALL
RIGHT? I GOTTA ANSWER THIS.

29:47.280 --> 29:48.450
&lt;SIGHS&gt; YEAH?

29:48.490 --> 29:50.700
JAKE, IT'S JUSTIN SLADE.
I NEED TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

29:50.740 --> 29:53.710
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU
AND I THINK YOU'RE THE
ONLY ONE I CAN TRUST.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.370
OKAY, WHEN?

29:55.420 --> 29:56.920
IN MY OFFICE, IN AN HOUR.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.840
I'VE GOT A PRECAUTION
TO TAKE FIRST.

29:58.880 --> 29:59.920
PRECAUTION?

29:59.960 --> 30:01.000
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

30:01.050 --> 30:02.260
FINE.

30:04.010 --> 30:07.050
JAKE, I THINK THIS
IS THE PLACE FOR US.

30:07.090 --> 30:09.800
YOU HAVE TO SEE THE
VIEW FROM THE DECK.

30:09.850 --> 30:10.930
COME ON.

30:10.970 --> 30:12.890
-ARE YOU COMING?
-NO, ACTUALLY,
I'VE GOTTA WORK.

30:12.930 --> 30:14.980
I GOTTA GO, BUT WHY DON'T
YOU HAVE A LOOK AROUND?

30:15.020 --> 30:18.020
YOU TAKE LOTS OF PICTURES FOR
ME AND I'LL CALL YOU LATER,
OKAY?

30:18.350 --> 30:19.480
OKAY.

30:21.980 --> 30:22.980
&lt;GROANING&gt;

30:24.990 --> 30:25.990
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

30:28.410 --> 30:30.490
UH, TONYA, YOU...

30:34.200 --> 30:35.210
&lt;BEEP&gt;

30:36.660 --> 30:38.330
-MAYOR?
-HELLO?

30:38.370 --> 30:39.960
LESLIE.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.500
&lt;STAMMERS&gt; WHY ARE YOU CALLING
FROM THE MAYOR'S PHONE?

30:42.550 --> 30:43.920
JAKE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TALKING TO BILL?

30:43.960 --> 30:45.970
HE'S CALLED THIS
NUMBER OVER AND OVER.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.180
ACTUALLY THIS IS
MY CLIENT'S PHONE,

30:48.220 --> 30:49.840
TONYA ST. CROIX.

30:49.890 --> 30:50.970
YOU KNOW, THE LAND DEVELOPER.

30:51.010 --> 30:52.810
OCEAN POINT, ALL OF THAT.

30:52.850 --> 30:54.350
THE WOMAN HE BOUGHT
THE HOUSE FROM.

30:54.390 --> 30:56.770
YEAH, WELL, THAT MAKES
SENSE. I MEAN,

30:56.810 --> 30:58.390
HE'D CALL HIS REAL
ESTATE AGENT.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.060
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

31:00.100 --> 31:02.320
-LESLIE...
-FORGET IT. I GOTTA GO.

31:03.520 --> 31:04.610
WHA...

31:04.650 --> 31:05.780
&lt;BEEP&gt;

31:05.820 --> 31:07.360
HEY, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE HEADING OUT?

31:07.400 --> 31:09.990
YEAH, I AM.
I'LL... I'LL SEE YOU.

31:10.570 --> 31:11.740
SO YOU LOOK AROUND.

31:11.780 --> 31:13.990
YOU HAVE FUN.
YOU ENJOY THE PLACE.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.830
LOTS OF PICTURES.

31:18.120 --> 31:19.120
[ROSE] GOT TO LOVE THE
NEW MARKET, HUH?

31:19.960 --> 31:21.790
THAT'S A BIG NUMBER.

31:21.830 --> 31:23.710
BUT YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY
THINKING WE SHOULD SELL?

31:23.750 --> 31:24.960
HEY, GUYS.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.090
HEY.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.840
THANKS, DAD.

31:30.390 --> 31:31.720
NO.

31:31.760 --> 31:33.970
WHY WOULD WE WANT TO
SELL THIS PLACE, HUH?

31:34.010 --> 31:35.850
&lt;DISTANT CLATTER AND LAUGHING&gt;

31:35.890 --> 31:36.890
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

31:41.100 --> 31:42.360
JUSTIN?

31:47.030 --> 31:49.700
OH, NO.

31:54.660 --> 31:55.660
&lt;EXHALES&gt;

31:57.580 --> 31:58.580
&lt;SIRENS WAILING&gt;

32:00.460 --> 32:03.170
NO WITNESSES.
NOBODY SAW ANYTHING.

32:03.210 --> 32:05.040
HE WAS HIT OVER THE HEAD
WITH A BLUNT OBJECT.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.130
DID HE SAY WHAT HE WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT?

32:07.170 --> 32:11.260
UM, HE JUST SAID HE HAD
SOMETHING THAT HE WANTED
ME TO SEE.

32:11.300 --> 32:13.430
AND HE THOUGHT I WAS THE
ONLY PERSON HE COULD TRUST.

32:17.350 --> 32:23.060
JAKE, DO YOU THINK THAT...

32:23.100 --> 32:24.690
DO YOU THINK BILL
COULD HAVE DONE THIS?

32:26.070 --> 32:27.440
WHY DO YOU ASK?

32:27.480 --> 32:31.860
I TOLD HIM THAT JUSTIN WAS
DIGGING UP SOMETHING ON HIM.

32:32.410 --> 32:34.410
I DON'T KNOW, LESLIE.

32:34.450 --> 32:36.240
HONESTLY, I DON'T.

32:38.950 --> 32:40.200
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

32:40.250 --> 32:41.410
I'M SORRY.

32:45.080 --> 32:46.210
[TONYA] HELLO?

32:46.250 --> 32:47.920
TONYA, SOMETHING'S HAPPENED.

32:47.960 --> 32:49.050
WELL, WHAT'S GOING ON?

32:49.090 --> 32:50.840
SOMEONE KILLED JUSTIN SLADE.

32:50.880 --> 32:52.050
OH, MY GOD!

32:53.180 --> 32:54.260
WELL, WHO WOULD
DO SUCH A THING?

32:54.300 --> 32:56.720
I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE,
BUT WHOEVER IT IS,

32:56.760 --> 33:00.270
I THINK THEY HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH YOUR DEVELOPMENT,
SO YOU'RE IN DANGER.

33:00.310 --> 33:03.140
JUST STAY AT HOME UNTIL
YOU HEAR FROM ME, OKAY?

33:04.440 --> 33:06.650
WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE.

33:06.690 --> 33:08.070
WHERE DID THIS
PHOTO COME FROM?

33:08.110 --> 33:10.440
OH, MAL AND I WERE DOING A
LITTLE DIGGING,
WORKING TOGETHER.

33:10.490 --> 33:12.240
YEAH, WE FOUND
THEM IN BRETT'S CAR.

33:12.280 --> 33:13.450
THEY'RE REAL ESTATE LEADS.

33:13.490 --> 33:16.200
REAL ESTATE LEADS, EH?

33:16.240 --> 33:20.200
I SAW THESE WHEN I WAS IN
TONYA'S TRAILER BEFORE
THE THING BLEW UP.

33:20.240 --> 33:21.750
SO BRETT'S GOTTA
BE OUR GUY, THEN?

33:21.790 --> 33:23.410
YES.

33:23.460 --> 33:26.290
LOOK, BRETT'S BEEF WAS
WITH TONYA, NOT WITH JUSTIN.

33:26.330 --> 33:28.840
YEAH. BUT IF BRETT MANAGES TO
GET THE PROPERTY FROM TONYA...

33:28.880 --> 33:30.630
HE'D STILL HAVE TO GET JUSTIN
OUT OF THE WAY TO DEVELOP IT.

33:30.670 --> 33:32.130
-SHUT UP!
-OKAY.

33:32.170 --> 33:34.760
OBVIOUSLY, THE MAYOR IS
THE PRIME SUSPECT HERE.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.050
SERIOUSLY, THINK ABOUT IT.

33:36.090 --> 33:37.970
HE KNEW JUSTIN WAS
INVESTIGATING HIM.

33:38.010 --> 33:40.260
MAYBE JUSTIN WAS GETTING
TOO CLOSE TO THE TRUTH.

33:40.310 --> 33:42.020
THAT'S A SERIOUS
ACCUSATION, JAKE.

33:42.060 --> 33:43.140
I AGREE.

33:43.180 --> 33:45.980
-&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;
-&lt;SIGHS&gt;

33:46.020 --> 33:47.520
-HI.
-[TONYA] JAKE,
CAN YOU GET OVER HERE?

33:47.560 --> 33:49.570
I THINK SOMEONE'S TRYING
TO BREAK INTO MY HOUSE.

33:49.610 --> 33:51.150
-HURRY.
-OKAY. CALL THE POLICE.

33:51.190 --> 33:52.650
WE'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE.

33:52.690 --> 33:54.610
-DAD, LET'S GO.
-LET'S ROLL.

33:54.650 --> 33:56.320
NO, NO, NO. YOU STAY HERE.
DAD.

34:02.950 --> 34:04.000
SORRY.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.670
WHY DO YOU INSIST ON
FOLLOWING ME EVERYWHERE?

34:05.710 --> 34:06.750
I'M NOT FOLLOWING YOU.

34:06.790 --> 34:08.330
ACTUALLY TONYA ASKED
US TO MEET HER HERE.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.550
-SEE?
-YOU STAY AWAY FROM ME,
YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH!

34:10.590 --> 34:12.840
YOU KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF ME!

34:12.880 --> 34:14.220
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
SCREAMING ABOUT?

34:15.010 --> 34:16.180
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

34:16.220 --> 34:17.300
OW!

34:17.340 --> 34:18.470
WHAT...

34:18.510 --> 34:19.640
OH, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

34:19.680 --> 34:21.010
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING.

34:21.060 --> 34:22.930
HE THREATENED TO KILL ME.
YOU CHECK HIS BRIEFCASE.

34:24.390 --> 34:25.440
ALL RIGHT.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.020
OH, WHOA.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.070
I'M NO EXPERT, BUT...

34:35.150 --> 34:36.240
&lt;CLICKS TONGUE&gt;

34:36.280 --> 34:38.070
THIS KIND OF LOOKS
LIKE A MURDER WEAPON.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.290
[BRETT] I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

34:44.330 --> 34:46.080
I WAS NOWHERE NEAR
JUSTIN'S PLACE THAT NIGHT.

34:46.120 --> 34:50.250
I WAS AT A SPECIAL
SORT OF PARTY.

34:50.290 --> 34:53.590
REALLY? SO WHAT WERE YOU DOING
CARRYING AROUND THE MURDER
WEAPON IN YOUR BRIEFCASE?

34:53.630 --> 34:54.840
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW THAT GOT THERE.

34:54.880 --> 34:56.510
I SWEAR!

34:56.550 --> 34:59.720
WE KNOW YOU'RE THE ONE
RESPONSIBLE BEHIND THE MESS
SURROUNDING THE SITE, OKAY?

34:59.760 --> 35:04.180
YOU TORCHED THE TRAILER. WE
FOUND TONYA'S REAL ESTATE
LEADS IN YOUR CAR.

35:04.220 --> 35:06.770
ALL RIGHT. LOOK, I TRIED TO
TAKE SOME OF TONYA'S CLIENTS.

35:08.230 --> 35:10.520
AND I BLEW UP THE TRAILER.

35:10.560 --> 35:13.230
I FIGURED IF TONYA DROPPED THE
SOUTH SIDE DEVELOPMENT,
I COULD GET IN THERE.

35:13.270 --> 35:14.400
I COULD PICK IT UP FOR MYSELF.

35:14.440 --> 35:17.110
BUT, SERGEANT,
I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

35:17.150 --> 35:18.240
YEAH, RIGHT.

35:18.280 --> 35:19.860
I'M NOT THE VIOLENT TYPE.

35:19.910 --> 35:20.950
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

35:20.990 --> 35:22.280
A LOT OF MONEY INVOLVED.

35:22.330 --> 35:24.290
DOESN'T MEAN
HE'S A KILLER, THOUGH.

35:24.330 --> 35:25.290
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING?

35:25.330 --> 35:27.660
I'M THINKING YOU SUSPECTED
THAT TONYA KNEW

35:27.710 --> 35:29.870
THAT YOU KILLED JUSTIN AND
YOU WENT OVER TO SHUT HER UP.

35:29.920 --> 35:31.630
NO, NO, NO.
SHE INVITED ME OVER THERE.

35:31.670 --> 35:33.380
IT WAS JUST SUPPOSED
TO BE SEX.

35:34.340 --> 35:37.130
WE HAVE THIS WICKED SEX LIFE,

35:37.170 --> 35:39.010
PARTICULARLY WHEN WE'RE
NOT GETTING ALONG.

35:39.720 --> 35:40.760
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

35:42.720 --> 35:45.140
I SHOULD PROBABLY
SPEAK TO A LAWYER, EH?

35:45.180 --> 35:46.270
YEAH.

35:46.310 --> 35:47.850
[HOOD] HIS STORY CHECKS OUT.

35:47.890 --> 35:49.640
HE WAS AT SOMETHING
CALLED A "KEY PARTY."

35:49.690 --> 35:51.350
A KEY PARTY?

35:51.400 --> 35:54.480
APPARENTLY THEY'RE
ORGY-TYPE THINGS.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.530
HE HAS 35 PEOPLE TO
CORROBORATE HIS STORY.

35:57.440 --> 35:58.240
IT'S ALL ON TAPE.

35:58.280 --> 35:59.570
WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US?

35:59.610 --> 36:01.360
SQUARE ONE.

36:01.410 --> 36:04.950
WELL, I'LL BE IN MY OFFICE
REVIEWING THE TAPE
FOR FURTHER EVIDENCE.

36:10.870 --> 36:11.920
LET'S GO, JAKE.

36:11.960 --> 36:14.250
UH, I'LL CATCH UP WITH
YOU IN A BIT, DAD.

36:15.880 --> 36:18.260
SO, THERE'S STILL
A KILLER OUT THERE.

36:19.260 --> 36:20.510
LET ME HANDLE THIS.

36:20.550 --> 36:23.340
I CAUGHT THE MAYOR BREAKING
INTO JUSTIN'S OFFICE.

36:23.390 --> 36:25.010
AND, LESLIE, HE LOOKED
PRETTY DESPERATE.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.390
I GOTTA GET BACK IN THERE.

36:28.100 --> 36:29.980
I'LL CALL YOU LATER, OKAY?

36:33.690 --> 36:34.690
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

36:39.740 --> 36:43.110
BRETT "THE SMOKING GUN"
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

36:43.160 --> 36:44.660
YOUR MAYOR THEORY.

36:44.700 --> 36:46.620
OH, LOOK, SOMEONE
LEFT THIS FOR YOU.

36:46.660 --> 36:48.240
IT'S FROM...

36:49.160 --> 36:50.540
JUSTIN SLADE.

36:53.420 --> 36:56.290
"JAKE, THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE
INTERESTED IN THIS. JUSTIN."

36:57.500 --> 36:59.300
HE LEFT THIS FOR ME
BEFORE HE DIED.

37:03.380 --> 37:04.220
WHAT IS IT?

37:07.350 --> 37:08.970
IT'S A LAND SURVEY.

37:09.020 --> 37:11.390
IT'S OLD, BY THE LOOKS OF IT.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.560
AND THIS IS A LAND DEED

37:13.600 --> 37:15.940
FOR THE SITE WHERE THEY'RE
DEVELOPING OCEAN POINT.

37:15.980 --> 37:17.230
WHAT ABOUT IT?

37:17.270 --> 37:19.280
TONYA DOESN'T OWN THE LAND
IN THE SOUTH SIDE HILLS.

37:19.860 --> 37:21.030
THEN WHO DOES?

37:21.570 --> 37:22.780
WE DO.

37:23.780 --> 37:25.700
IT'S CROWN LAND.

37:25.740 --> 37:28.410
THE WHOLE DEVELOPMENT.
IT'S ILLEGAL.

37:28.450 --> 37:30.450
OCEAN POINT IS APPROVED
ON CROWN LAND?

37:30.490 --> 37:31.450
IT'S NOT LEGIT?

37:31.500 --> 37:33.500
THAT MUST BE WHAT JUSTIN
WANTED TO TALK TO ME ABOUT.

37:33.540 --> 37:36.130
THE MAYOR, HE WAS PUSHING
THIS PAST COUNCIL.

37:36.170 --> 37:38.090
TRYING TO BUILD ON LAND
YOU CAN'T EVEN OWN.

37:38.130 --> 37:40.630
THAT INFO GETS OUT, IT WOULD
SINK THE DEVELOPMENT FOR SURE.

37:40.670 --> 37:43.220
IT WOULD TAKE TONYA
DOWN WITH IT.

37:47.220 --> 37:48.260
HELLO.

37:48.300 --> 37:51.430
LESLIE, YOU'VE GOT THE
WRONG MAN IN CUSTODY.

37:58.270 --> 38:00.480
PLANNING A LITTLE TRIP,
ARE WE?

38:01.070 --> 38:02.110
OH.

38:02.780 --> 38:04.070
YOU SCARED ME.

38:04.110 --> 38:05.450
UH, YEAH.

38:05.490 --> 38:06.530
YEAH, I WAS, UM...

38:06.570 --> 38:08.490
I JUST NEED TO GET
AWAY FOR AWHILE.

38:08.530 --> 38:10.700
I MEAN, YOU CAUGHT THE
MURDERER, DIDN'T YOU?

38:12.290 --> 38:13.370
OH, YEAH.

38:13.410 --> 38:14.750
WE CAUGHT HER, ALL RIGHT.

38:16.170 --> 38:18.290
YOU FRAMED BRETT FOR
JUSTIN SLADE'S MURDER.

38:19.380 --> 38:20.460
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

38:20.500 --> 38:22.420
WELL, WE FIGURE HE FOUND
OUT ABOUT THE FACT

38:22.460 --> 38:24.800
THAT YOU WERE DEVELOPING ON
LAND THAT YOU DIDN'T
ACTUALLY OWN.

38:24.840 --> 38:25.880
SO YOU KILL HIM,

38:25.930 --> 38:28.390
YOU CALL BRETT BABCOCK OVER.

38:28.430 --> 38:30.100
AND PUT THE HAMMER
IN HIS BRIEFCASE.

38:30.140 --> 38:31.430
THEN YOU CALLED US.

38:31.470 --> 38:32.890
NO, YOU HAVE NO PROOF OF THAT.

38:32.930 --> 38:34.600
SEE, THAT'S WHERE
YOU'RE WRONG.

38:34.640 --> 38:37.560
YOU CLEANED THE PRINTS OFF THE
HAMMER, BUT YOU FORGOT TO DO
THE SAME FOR THE BRIEFCASE.

38:40.400 --> 38:41.860
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

38:41.900 --> 38:44.740
OH, YOU ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED
JUSTIN'S HEAD IN
WITH A HAMMER?

38:44.780 --> 38:49.070
NO, I WENT OVER TO TALK TO HIM
TO TRY TO COME TO SOME KIND
OF AN UNDERSTANDING.

38:49.120 --> 38:50.740
-YOU MEAN BRIBE HIM.
-NO.

38:50.780 --> 38:53.700
BUT HE WOULDN'T TAKE
THE BRIBE, I'M GUESSING.

38:53.740 --> 38:56.660
JUSTIN TOLD ME
ABOUT HIS FINDINGS

38:56.710 --> 39:00.630
AND THAT HE WAS PLANNING TO
BLOW THIS WHOLE DEVELOPMENT
OUT OF THE WATER.

39:00.670 --> 39:04.090
I WORKED SO HARD TO GET HERE.

39:04.130 --> 39:07.170
DID THE MAYOR KNOW THAT
THIS WAS CROWN LAND?

39:07.220 --> 39:09.260
MIGHT HELP WITH
YOUR PLEA BARGAINING.

39:10.720 --> 39:13.310
YEAH, THE MAYOR KNEW.

39:13.350 --> 39:16.680
WE WERE COVERING IT UP UNTIL
ALL THE UNITS WERE BUILT.

39:17.890 --> 39:20.100
THAT WAY IT WOULD BE TOO LATE.

39:20.150 --> 39:22.190
AND WHY WOULD THE
MAYOR DO THIS FOR YOU?

39:22.860 --> 39:24.190
I PAID HIM TO DO IT.

39:26.280 --> 39:29.280
HE WAS GOING TO MAKE
A PERCENTAGE OF THE PROFITS.

39:30.320 --> 39:32.830
AND HE WAS GOING
TO GET A FREE HOUSE.

39:58.060 --> 39:59.640
HEY, LESLIE.

39:59.690 --> 40:01.150
WHAT'S WRONG?

40:01.190 --> 40:04.270
I KNOW ABOUT THE
KICKBACK, THE HOUSE.

40:04.320 --> 40:05.690
BUT I ASSUME THERE'S
BEEN MORE.

40:05.730 --> 40:07.530
I'VE SUSPECTED FOR AWHILE.

40:07.570 --> 40:09.200
LOOK, I CAN EXPLAIN.

40:09.240 --> 40:13.410
DON'T. TONYA CONFESSED TO THE
MURDER AND HER DEAL WITH YOU.

40:13.450 --> 40:16.580
WE KNOW YOU WERE COVERING UP
THE FACT THAT SHE WAS BUILDING
ON CROWN LAND.

40:16.620 --> 40:18.660
I KNOW YOU WERE
MAKING A PROFIT.

40:18.700 --> 40:19.580
SO DID JUSTIN.

40:21.290 --> 40:22.960
A MAN DIED 'CAUSE OF ALL THIS.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.590
I DID THAT FOR OUR FUTURE.

40:26.710 --> 40:31.340
I WON'T BE MAYOR FOREVER AND I
JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT
WE WERE LOOKED AFTER.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.560
COME ON, PLEASE.

40:38.600 --> 40:41.270
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
YOU'D DO TO CUT ME SOME
KIND OF BREAK HERE.

40:41.850 --> 40:43.940
I ALREADY DID.

40:43.980 --> 40:46.650
WE COULD HAVE DONE THIS
INSIDE IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

40:46.690 --> 40:49.240
-DON'T...
-SERGEANT HOOD!

40:49.280 --> 40:50.690
I GOTTA BE HONEST,

40:50.740 --> 40:51.900
NEVER BEEN A FAN.

40:54.240 --> 40:58.080
WILLIAM CADIGAN CLARKE,
I'M ARRESTING YOU
ON SUSPICION OF FRAUD.

40:58.120 --> 41:00.620
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO RETAIN
AND INSTRUCT A LAWYER
WITHOUT DELAY.

41:00.660 --> 41:02.410
YOU DID THIS.

41:02.460 --> 41:05.000
YOU RUINED ME SO YOU
COULD GET BACK TO HER.

41:05.040 --> 41:07.000
...LEGAL ADVICE OR A LAWYER
OF YOUR OWN CHOOSING.

41:11.050 --> 41:13.680
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

41:13.720 --> 41:16.550
I HAD MY SUSPICIONS.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.720
I DIDN'T FOLLOW THROUGH.
THAT'S WRONG ENOUGH.

41:36.660 --> 41:39.580
COME ON. I'LL LET YOU
TAKE ME TO A MOVIE.

41:39.620 --> 41:40.540
YOUR TREAT.

41:43.620 --> 41:44.750
YEAH? YEAH, OKAY.

41:47.130 --> 41:49.000
AH! UH...

41:49.040 --> 41:51.380
I ACTUALLY GOT KIND
OF A BIG DAY TOMORROW.

41:51.420 --> 41:54.170
SO, UM, I'M GOING TO BID
YOU ALL GOOD NIGHT.

41:56.760 --> 41:57.760
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

41:58.800 --> 41:59.760
WHATEVER.

42:03.930 --> 42:07.020
THAT WOULD PAY FOR A FEW YEARS
ON A QUIET BEACH SOMEWHERE.

42:09.110 --> 42:11.320
-WHAT YOU GOT THERE?
-IT'S FROM MARTIN.

42:11.360 --> 42:12.690
-POOLE?
-UH-HUH.

42:16.950 --> 42:18.660
IT'S NOT TICKING.
YOU SHOULD OPEN IT.

42:18.700 --> 42:19.910
-YOU OPEN IT.
-HE'S YOUR EX.

42:19.950 --> 42:21.740
-NO, YOU.
-FINE.

42:24.330 --> 42:25.960
&lt;INHALES DEEPLY&gt;
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;

42:32.840 --> 42:34.760
OH, THIS IS SICK,
EVEN FOR HIM.

42:34.800 --> 42:35.840
UH-UH. UH-UH.

42:35.880 --> 42:40.470
MARTIN USED TO SEND THINGS
THIS WAY BACK IN THE DAY.

42:40.510 --> 42:43.600
YOU KNOW, WHEN HE WAS
SMUGGLING THIS STUFF, RIGHT?

42:46.810 --> 42:48.400
OH, MY.

42:48.440 --> 42:51.070
-THERE MUST BE...
-"300,000.

42:51.770 --> 42:53.940
"AS PROMISED. ENJOY.

42:53.980 --> 42:55.240
"LOVE MARTIN."

42:57.780 --> 42:58.780
JAKE!

42:59.370 --> 43:00.660
WHAT'S THE WORD?

43:00.700 --> 43:03.330
I JUST WATCHED THE
MAYOR GET ARRESTED.

43:05.290 --> 43:06.870
THAT MUST HAVE
BEEN SATISFYING.

43:06.910 --> 43:12.460
TO BE HONEST, THE LOOK IN
LESLIE'S EYES KIND OF
TOOK THE FUN OUT OF IT FOR ME.

43:12.500 --> 43:13.800
-UM...
-&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

43:17.590 --> 43:18.630
-HEY THERE.
-HEY.

43:18.680 --> 43:20.680
I WAS ACTUALLY ON
MY WAY TO SEE YOU.

43:20.720 --> 43:22.680
WELL, YOU CAN BUY
ME A DRINK INSTEAD.

43:22.720 --> 43:24.180
CONGRATULATIONS ARE IN ORDER.

43:24.220 --> 43:25.560
OH YEAH? FOR WHAT?

43:25.600 --> 43:27.310
I JUST BOUGHT A HOUSE.

43:27.350 --> 43:29.520
SIGNED, SEALED AND DELIVERED.

43:29.560 --> 43:31.980
DO YOU FEEL LIKE
HAVING YOUR OWN CLOSET?

43:32.020 --> 43:33.480
UH...

43:35.820 --> 43:37.740
&lt;MUSIC PLAYING&gt;
