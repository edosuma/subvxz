♪♪

00:07.208 --> 00:08.679
-You're a really good kisser.
-(laughs)

00:08.679 --> 00:10.241
You're a really
good everythinger.

00:10.241 --> 00:11.912
Well, how do you know?

00:11.912 --> 00:14.285
We haven't everythinged... yet.

00:14.285 --> 00:16.117
Which is why

00:16.117 --> 00:18.319
I am making dinner
tonight at my place.

00:18.319 --> 00:20.121
It's gonna be intimate
and romantic

00:20.121 --> 00:22.293
and feature potatoes
'cause I have a big bag of them

00:22.293 --> 00:23.894
at my apartment
and they're about to go bad.

00:25.296 --> 00:27.158
-(phone rings)
-Ugh. Conference call.

00:27.158 --> 00:28.299
Hey...

00:28.299 --> 00:30.101
see you and those
potatoes tonight.

00:30.101 --> 00:31.832
Muah!

00:31.832 --> 00:32.833
(knocking)

00:38.169 --> 00:39.970
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:41.742 --> 00:42.813
Who are you?

00:42.813 --> 00:44.245
Uh, I'm Gabi.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.846
I'm Josh Kaminski's chef.

00:45.846 --> 00:46.917
Who are you?

00:46.917 --> 00:49.450
Kathy, Josh Kaminski's mom.

00:49.450 --> 00:50.451
I win.

00:51.922 --> 00:54.555
Oh, my goodness!
Well, come on in.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.957
You know, Josh has told me

00:56.957 --> 00:58.329
so many amazing
things about you.

00:58.329 --> 00:59.390
(laughs)

00:59.390 --> 01:01.061
So you're a liar.

01:02.363 --> 01:04.395
I already like you.

01:04.395 --> 01:07.338
So, um, Josh didn't mention
that you were coming.

01:07.338 --> 01:09.200
Neither did his father,

01:09.200 --> 01:10.501
which is why I have Josh.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.307
My boyfriend and I just broke up

01:16.307 --> 01:18.249
and I just wanted to
be with my son...

01:18.249 --> 01:21.011
and his expensive Scotch.

01:21.011 --> 01:22.983
Ooh, Scotch for breakfast.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.084
Allow me.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.386
Thank you.

01:25.386 --> 01:27.318
Do you want me to mix it
in some coffee for you?

01:27.318 --> 01:29.360
Ooh, no.
Then it'll be too hot

01:29.360 --> 01:31.162
and I'll have to
drink it slowly.

01:31.162 --> 01:33.194
(laughs)

01:33.194 --> 01:34.995
Ah, funny and beautiful.

01:34.995 --> 01:36.797
You must have been the one
that did the dumping.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.569
Um, so, what happened?

01:38.569 --> 01:42.373
Let's just say the relationship
was harder than he was.

01:42.373 --> 01:44.205
Oh.

01:44.205 --> 01:45.236
Oh!

01:45.236 --> 01:47.378
Guess who got off
his conference call early

01:47.378 --> 01:50.141
and is hot
for a little-- Mommy.

01:50.141 --> 01:52.343
Joshy!

01:52.343 --> 01:54.845
Uh... Scotch,

01:54.845 --> 01:56.247
awake at 9:00 A.M.

01:57.318 --> 01:58.619
Who'd you break up with?

01:59.890 --> 02:03.254
Can't a mom just come
see her darling son?

02:03.254 --> 02:04.725
-Hector.
-Ah.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.227
Well, I'm actually
glad you're here.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.127
You met my girlfriend, Gabi.

02:08.399 --> 02:09.300
Girlfriend?

02:09.300 --> 02:11.232
I thought she was your chef.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.234
I actually am both.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.905
Um, girlfriend recently.

02:14.905 --> 02:16.267
-(ding)
-And chef right now.

02:16.267 --> 02:17.308
Sticky buns!

02:19.210 --> 02:21.141
Isn't Gabi great?

02:21.141 --> 02:22.443
She's adorable.

02:22.443 --> 02:23.514
Dump her.

02:47.398 --> 02:49.400
I made you your favorite:

02:49.400 --> 02:51.101
turkey club and curly fries.

02:52.102 --> 02:53.374
Speaking of favorites,

02:53.374 --> 02:55.446
I think I'm your mom's new one.

02:55.446 --> 02:56.977
(giggles)

02:56.977 --> 02:58.379
Quick, quick,
while she's upstairs,

02:58.379 --> 02:59.410
tell me everything.

02:59.410 --> 03:01.452
Does she wanna put me
in an ice cream cone

03:01.452 --> 03:02.413
and just eat me up?

03:04.315 --> 03:07.418
-(chuckles)
-She does! She loved me!

03:07.418 --> 03:10.020
My mom always said there are
two ways to a man's heart:

03:10.020 --> 03:11.862
through his stomach
and through his mother.

03:11.862 --> 03:14.325
And guess what?
Check and checkola.

03:15.926 --> 03:16.967
Gabi...

03:16.967 --> 03:18.329
Listen, I already know
what you're gonna say,

03:18.329 --> 03:19.830
and of course we can
have her over

03:19.830 --> 03:21.402
at my place
for dinner tonight.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.874
So tell me, how does
your mom like her potatoes?

03:23.874 --> 03:25.406
Distilled into vodka.

03:27.338 --> 03:29.280
Look, there's something
I want to tell you,

03:29.280 --> 03:31.982
but I'm not really sure
how to say it.

03:31.982 --> 03:33.944
Oh, Josh, it's okay.

03:33.944 --> 03:35.486
I already know.

03:35.486 --> 03:38.889
(whispers)
Your mom has a drinking problem.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.753
Yeah, and a bit
of a problem...

03:42.753 --> 03:43.894
with you.

03:44.855 --> 03:46.657
-What?
-She thinks you're
a gold digger.

03:46.657 --> 03:47.858
What?

03:47.858 --> 03:49.460
Why? What would
make her think that?

03:49.460 --> 03:51.362
I'm rich, you're poor.
Her words, not mine.

03:52.703 --> 03:53.804
Then...

03:53.804 --> 03:56.206
you told her I'm not
after your money, right?

03:56.206 --> 03:57.438
Of course I did.

03:57.438 --> 03:58.909
But she didn't listen

03:58.909 --> 04:02.443
'cause she's a judgmental,
pill-popping boozer.

04:02.443 --> 04:05.175
But I want that judgmental,
pill-popping boozer to like me.

04:06.477 --> 04:08.549
Look, we're talking about
a woman who has never had

04:08.549 --> 04:10.551
a successful relationship
in her life.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.483
She bounces from man
to man to man.

04:12.483 --> 04:14.525
Honestly, I think
it's a sickness.

04:14.525 --> 04:17.057
But the point is, it doesn't
matter what she thinks.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.859
It matters what I think,

04:18.859 --> 04:20.060
and I adore you.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.363
And I adore you.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.366
Which is why

04:25.366 --> 04:27.638
she is coming over
for dinner tonight

04:27.638 --> 04:29.570
to get to know
the real me,

04:29.570 --> 04:31.071
and what better way
to do that than

04:31.071 --> 04:32.403
to show her what I do best.

04:32.403 --> 04:33.474
So what's her favorite food?

04:33.474 --> 04:35.145
Anything she wants.

04:35.145 --> 04:38.148
Lobster, caviar, and champagne.

04:38.148 --> 04:39.810
Oh.

04:39.810 --> 04:41.552
Here, I'll give you
my credit card.

04:41.552 --> 04:42.613
What? No, no!

04:42.613 --> 04:44.355
What, so we can prove to her
that I am a gold digger?

04:44.355 --> 04:45.656
No way.

04:45.656 --> 04:47.658
Dinner's on me.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.423
Hey, Dad, do you have PayPal?

04:56.527 --> 04:58.599
Oh, thank God
you were free, Yolanda.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.471
Jake's out of town
and Gabi kicked me out

05:00.471 --> 05:01.632
of the apartment.

05:01.632 --> 05:04.535
So, what you're saying is
I was your last option.

05:05.506 --> 05:08.709
What I'm saying is
girls night out!

05:08.709 --> 05:09.840
(chuckles)

05:09.840 --> 05:11.882
Well, I'm excited
to be at a movie theater

05:11.882 --> 05:13.684
that serves alcohol.

05:13.684 --> 05:16.246
If they did this at church,
I might actually go.

05:17.618 --> 05:18.649
Ooh!

05:18.649 --> 05:20.421
It's two for one drinks.

05:20.421 --> 05:23.554
Okay, how about a margarita
and a piña colada?

05:23.554 --> 05:25.396
What are you gonna have?

05:25.396 --> 05:26.657
(laughs)
The same.

05:26.657 --> 05:29.299
By the way, my friend's
husband is out of town

05:29.299 --> 05:31.502
so I had to invite the bitch
to girls night out.

05:31.502 --> 05:32.463
I hope you don't mind.

05:32.463 --> 05:34.234
Hey, ladies!

05:34.234 --> 05:36.707
Hey, girl!

05:36.707 --> 05:38.569
Now sit down.
The usher will be here

05:38.569 --> 05:40.010
any second
with your booster seat.

05:41.412 --> 05:42.873
Would that be the same usher

05:42.873 --> 05:44.415
that had to butter you
into yours?

05:45.576 --> 05:47.948
Ooh, she is a bitch.

05:51.582 --> 05:54.555
So, uh, Kathy, can I get you
anything else?

05:54.555 --> 05:58.659
Lobster, caviar,
champagne, my kidney?

05:58.659 --> 06:00.831
No, but how's your liver?

06:03.063 --> 06:05.696
Mom, isn't this
a delicious dinner?

06:05.696 --> 06:08.699
That, um, Josh did not pay for?

06:08.699 --> 06:10.701
Gabi, I must say I'm impressed.

06:10.701 --> 06:12.072
Oh. Well, thank you.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.844
Do you hear that?
She's impressed.

06:13.844 --> 06:15.476
So, is it safe to leave
you two alone for a while?

06:15.476 --> 06:17.578
I've had to pee
for, like, 45 minutes.

06:17.578 --> 06:18.749
Yes, of course. Go!

06:18.749 --> 06:21.652
I'm very excited to have
some alone time with your mom.

06:21.652 --> 06:24.415
She's one of the most amazing
women I have ever met.

06:24.415 --> 06:25.586
(chuckles)

06:25.586 --> 06:27.518
You need to get out more.

06:30.461 --> 06:32.623
Well, um, should we retire

06:32.623 --> 06:34.665
to the living room for some

06:34.665 --> 06:35.996
fine Scotch that I paid for

06:35.996 --> 06:37.167
and have the receipt
to prove it?

06:39.600 --> 06:42.903
Gabi, clearly he told you
what I said.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.577
He did, and I swear
I am not a gold digger.

06:46.577 --> 06:48.138
This thing between me and Josh

06:48.138 --> 06:49.580
has been brewing
for a long time

06:49.580 --> 06:51.512
and it has nothing
to do with his money.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.413
It has everything
to do with him.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.985
You know what?
I believe you.

06:54.985 --> 06:56.487
You're not a gold digger.

06:56.487 --> 06:57.518
Thank you, Kathy.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.620
You're just not
good enough for him.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.991
Huh?

07:00.991 --> 07:03.393
Remember his ex-fiancée,
Caroline?

07:03.393 --> 07:06.026
She was rich, educated,
and from a good family?

07:06.026 --> 07:07.728
You're none of those things.

07:09.600 --> 07:10.601
Oh.

07:11.662 --> 07:12.733
Excuse me.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.605
Great Scotch.

07:14.605 --> 07:15.836
Cheap glass.

07:18.609 --> 07:19.910
How did it go?

07:19.910 --> 07:21.441
Well, it couldn't
have gone worse.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.543
(knocking)

07:26.076 --> 07:27.818
Dad, what are you doing here?

07:27.818 --> 07:30.651
Who's the lady who called
my little girl a gold digger?

07:30.651 --> 07:32.583
Ooh, that would be me.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.528
And it's worse.

07:41.492 --> 07:43.463
Look, I don't know you,
and you don't know me,

07:43.463 --> 07:45.596
but I heard what you said
about my baby girl

07:45.596 --> 07:47.498
and I was so pissed,
I jumped in my car

07:47.498 --> 07:49.469
and I drove four hours from Reno

07:49.469 --> 07:51.101
just to set you straight
about her.

07:51.101 --> 07:52.472
You left Reno?

07:52.472 --> 07:53.644
You should thank me.

07:55.676 --> 07:58.378
Dad, what are you doing?

07:58.378 --> 08:01.652
I'm standing up for you.
Now sit.

08:01.652 --> 08:04.454
Uh, sir, we haven't had
the pleasure of being
properly introduced.

08:04.454 --> 08:05.816
Josh Kaminski.

08:05.816 --> 08:09.319
Wh-- whoa. Josh Kaminski
as in her boss Josh Kaminski?

08:09.319 --> 08:10.661
Yeah.

08:10.661 --> 08:14.525
Um, did I forget to
mention that on the phone?

08:14.525 --> 08:17.828
Um, Josh is in fact
my boss and my boyfriend.

08:17.828 --> 08:19.069
I wear many hats.

08:19.069 --> 08:22.603
Oh, that is,
that is too good.

08:22.603 --> 08:25.075
So, your son is a boss
who's taking advantage

08:25.075 --> 08:27.908
of his much younger,
innocent employee,

08:27.908 --> 08:30.510
and yet my baby girl
is the one who lacks class.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.612
Dad.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.413
See this Jerry Springer
scene here?

08:38.348 --> 08:40.951
This is what I'm talking about
when I say your daughter lacks

08:40.951 --> 08:42.723
the pedigree for my son.

08:42.723 --> 08:43.924
The apple doesn't fall far.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.295
Oh, no, no, no.
He's the apple!

08:45.295 --> 08:46.426
Nick:
That does it.

08:46.426 --> 08:49.560
Fall far? My-- my daughter
is an-- is an angel...

08:49.560 --> 08:51.261
This is unbelievable.

08:51.261 --> 08:52.663
We're only four days
into our relationship

08:52.663 --> 08:54.304
and everything keeps happening!

08:54.304 --> 08:55.966
Everything but the sex.

08:57.167 --> 08:58.709
Really, Josh?
You wanna go there now?

08:58.709 --> 09:00.370
I'd like to go there anytime.

09:00.370 --> 09:01.912
(shattering)

09:01.912 --> 09:03.714
I think my mom
just threw a plate.

09:03.714 --> 09:05.215
-(gasps)
-Kind of her signature move.

09:05.215 --> 09:07.778
What? How am I gonna
return those now?

09:07.778 --> 09:08.879
Gabi, I'm serious.

09:08.879 --> 09:10.120
What are we gonna do?

09:10.120 --> 09:11.351
I'm not opposed to running.

09:12.823 --> 09:13.924
We gotta do
the only thing we can do.

09:13.924 --> 09:14.925
We gotta break up.

09:16.026 --> 09:17.087
Wh... what?

09:17.087 --> 09:18.659
No, no, not a real breakup.

09:18.659 --> 09:19.990
A fake breakup.

09:19.990 --> 09:21.061
A frake-up.

09:22.863 --> 09:23.994
Why would we do that?

09:23.994 --> 09:25.636
Think about it.
If we're not together,

09:25.636 --> 09:27.067
they have nothing
to fight about.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.740
And then they can go home
very far, far away from here.

09:29.740 --> 09:31.301
My dad's gotta
get back to work

09:31.301 --> 09:33.543
and your mom's gotta
get back to...

09:33.543 --> 09:34.775
drinking something.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.679
And then we can get back
to being just us.

09:38.679 --> 09:42.052
That is the dumbest idea, Gabi.

09:42.052 --> 09:43.714
Maybe my mom was right.

09:43.714 --> 09:45.886
-Why am I dating you?
-Josh...

09:45.886 --> 09:47.357
Fraking it.

09:47.357 --> 09:49.489
Oh, that was fraking good.

09:51.021 --> 09:52.262
(laughs)

09:52.262 --> 09:55.325
Look at Miss High Class
pouring herself another drink.

09:55.325 --> 09:57.768
No, this one's to
throw in your face.

09:57.768 --> 09:58.729
This one's my next drink.

10:00.530 --> 10:02.432
Well, take it to go, Mom.
We're leaving.

10:02.432 --> 10:03.934
Gabi and I broke up.

10:05.335 --> 10:07.407
Attaboy.
Love 'em and leave 'em.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.279
We may never know
who your real dad is,

10:09.279 --> 10:10.811
but you're definitely my son.

10:12.683 --> 10:14.284
Baby girl, you--
you really broke up?

10:14.284 --> 10:15.315
Are-- are you gonna be okay?

10:15.315 --> 10:17.818
Yes, Daddy.
I'm-- I'm glad it's over.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.119
I don't know
what I was thinking.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.491
How can there be
no to go cups?

10:22.893 --> 10:24.795
Hey, Marlboro Man,

10:24.795 --> 10:26.697
you must have
an empty Big Gulp cup

10:26.697 --> 10:28.328
in the back of your pickup.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.561
You know, the more
we thought about it,

10:31.561 --> 10:33.864
the more we realized
that you two were right.

10:33.864 --> 10:35.806
You know, you did
take advantage of me.

10:35.806 --> 10:37.668
And you are not
good enough for me.

10:37.668 --> 10:40.811
Hey, sweetheart,
let Mommy be bad cop.

10:42.072 --> 10:44.274
Goodbye, Larry the Cable Guy.

10:45.575 --> 10:47.317
So long, Honey Boo Boo.

10:50.981 --> 10:53.323
I can't believe
that uptight theater

10:53.323 --> 10:55.856
kicked us out last night
for being too loud.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.587
You could see
Ben Affleck's nipples.

10:57.587 --> 10:59.089
Excuse me for squealing.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.333
We did not get kicked out
because you were too loud

11:03.333 --> 11:04.634
or because Elliot laughs

11:04.634 --> 11:06.296
like a Junior Miss
getting her first tiara.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.870
It's because I'm Latina,

11:09.870 --> 11:11.972
you're black, and he's--

11:11.972 --> 11:12.703
Ugly?

11:14.544 --> 11:16.176
They can't treat us like that!

11:16.176 --> 11:17.677
She's right.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.749
-It's an injustice.
-Yeah.

11:18.749 --> 11:20.210
And we're not gonna
take it anymore.

11:20.210 --> 11:21.912
You know what I think?
I think we should start

11:21.912 --> 11:23.613
a social media campaign. Ha!

11:23.613 --> 11:24.915
I love it!

11:24.915 --> 11:25.986
What is that?

11:27.457 --> 11:29.589
It's where we tweet
about how we were wronged

11:29.589 --> 11:32.162
and then we ask everybody
to boycott that theater.

11:32.162 --> 11:34.795
The key is to come up
with a good hashtag.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.266
Hashtag.

11:36.266 --> 11:37.898
What is that?

11:37.898 --> 11:39.930
It got anything to do
with hash browns?

11:46.877 --> 11:47.908
Hello, boss.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.180
Hello, employee.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.714
Gabi, I was up
all night thinking

11:54.714 --> 11:55.886
and I just want you to know

11:55.886 --> 11:58.889
I like vodka in my orange juice.

12:00.851 --> 12:02.452
Way ahead of ya.

12:02.452 --> 12:03.924
Thanks, cutie.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.296
Anyway, I hope there are no
hard feelings about last night.

12:06.296 --> 12:08.728
-There aren't.
-'Cause I think
you're a great girl

12:08.728 --> 12:10.000
and a top notch chef.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.832
Well, I'm off
for my morning run.

12:11.832 --> 12:12.863
Mom, you don't run.

12:12.863 --> 12:14.734
I know, but it sounds better

12:14.734 --> 12:16.666
than forging for pills
in your medicine cabinet.

12:21.371 --> 12:22.773
See?

12:22.773 --> 12:24.975
Calling me "cutie",
morning drinking,

12:24.975 --> 12:26.847
everything's back to normal.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.448
We just have to frake it
for one more day.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.120
(sighs)
But I really want
to see you tonight.

12:30.120 --> 12:32.022
I know. I do too.

12:32.022 --> 12:34.925
Hey, maybe there's a way

12:34.925 --> 12:36.656
we can sneak out
and be together tonight.

12:37.828 --> 12:38.889
I'm listening.

12:38.889 --> 12:40.690
Well, my dad's gonna
watch the game at 7:00...

12:40.690 --> 12:42.963
Perfect. My mom's pills
kick in at 7:00.

12:44.494 --> 12:47.197
I was thinking maybe
we could go to the movies

12:47.197 --> 12:50.040
and sit in the back row
and make out like
we're in high school.

12:50.040 --> 12:53.043
Did you know that I saw
Transformers six times?

12:54.044 --> 12:55.545
How amazing were those robots?

12:55.545 --> 12:57.077
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.349
Actually, I heard
Transformers six times.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.117
This was such a good idea.

13:07.117 --> 13:09.359
I cannot wait to not see
this movie with you.

13:09.359 --> 13:10.520
I know.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.463
I don't even care
what we're not seeing.

13:13.463 --> 13:15.695
Hey, you know what
I just realized?

13:15.695 --> 13:17.327
This is our first
movie together.

13:17.327 --> 13:19.199
-I'm gonna
remember it forever.
-Aww.

13:20.931 --> 13:23.073
Me too.

13:23.073 --> 13:25.105
Because our parents are
making out with each other
right there!

13:31.341 --> 13:33.083
-Ew. Ew.
-Ew. Ew.

13:33.083 --> 13:34.184
Both:
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

13:34.184 --> 13:35.886
We gotta stop them.

13:35.886 --> 13:37.147
No, we can't.

13:37.147 --> 13:39.850
If they see us
on a date together,
we'll look like liars.

13:39.850 --> 13:40.921
We are liars!

13:40.921 --> 13:42.192
Shh!

13:42.192 --> 13:43.753
You shh!

13:43.753 --> 13:45.795
You're not the one whose parents
are making out right over there!

13:45.795 --> 13:48.428
Yeah! And we are not
brother and sister!

13:50.300 --> 13:51.932
-Gabi?
-No!

13:56.266 --> 13:59.539
And here's to
a successful boycott.

13:59.539 --> 14:02.442
You guys should have heard
that theater manager
on the phone.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.945
He was so nervous.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.246
I gotta give it to you, Elliot.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.448
Tweeting our story
through various media platforms

14:08.448 --> 14:10.050
really increased our outreach.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.582
(chuckles)
Hashtag your job ain't so hard.

14:15.125 --> 14:17.457
Okay, guys, listen to me.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.589
This theater manager
is gonna try to shut us up

14:19.589 --> 14:21.261
with a couple of
free movie passes.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.292
Uh-uh.

14:22.292 --> 14:23.863
We're gonna want
a whole year's worth.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.196
-And a year of free popcorn.
-And two years of free booze!

14:26.196 --> 14:27.837
(knocking)

14:27.837 --> 14:29.799
Oh, my God,
he's early.

14:29.799 --> 14:31.701
Now remember,
let me do the talking.

14:31.701 --> 14:35.445
I have a dream that one day
we will all see movies for free.

14:36.947 --> 14:38.448
Free at last, free at last!

14:38.448 --> 14:40.710
Thank God Almighty,
the drinks are free at last.

14:44.054 --> 14:46.056
Mr. Klepfer, I presume.

14:46.056 --> 14:48.858
Sofia. We spoke on the phone.
Do come in.

14:48.858 --> 14:50.160
Well, I just wanted
you to know

14:50.160 --> 14:53.523
that I came down here personally
because we take claims

14:53.523 --> 14:55.695
-of discrimination
very seriously.
-Good.

14:55.695 --> 14:56.866
-Thank you.
-Vodka.

14:58.298 --> 15:01.071
Which is why I brought
last night's footage

15:01.071 --> 15:02.372
from the theater
security camera.

15:02.372 --> 15:04.104
Oh, there's proof.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.475
We're gonna need to
see that footage, sir.

15:07.677 --> 15:09.139
Both:
Drink! Drink! Drink!

15:09.139 --> 15:10.981
Drink! Drink! Drink!

15:10.981 --> 15:12.182
(both cheer)

15:12.182 --> 15:14.044
I did it!

15:15.545 --> 15:18.288
Whoa! Hey, sexy!

15:18.288 --> 15:21.651
Wanna help me get
the popcorn out my bra?

15:21.651 --> 15:24.124
Yolanda:
Whoo-hoo!

15:24.124 --> 15:25.595
-Whoo!
-Uh-oh...

15:26.756 --> 15:28.428
I don't feel so good.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.459
(retches)

15:31.661 --> 15:33.964
So, as you can see,

15:33.964 --> 15:36.366
the only grounds
for legal action

15:36.366 --> 15:37.907
would be against you three

15:37.907 --> 15:39.469
for public intoxication.

15:39.469 --> 15:42.842
Let me tell you
something, Mr. Klepfer.

15:42.842 --> 15:45.115
If we promise never to
come back to your movie theater,

15:45.115 --> 15:46.146
can we just drop
this whole thing?

15:46.146 --> 15:47.177
Deal.

15:52.682 --> 15:53.823
How did this happen?

15:53.823 --> 15:54.854
How did this happen?

15:54.854 --> 15:56.226
How? How?

15:56.226 --> 15:57.487
How did this happen?

15:58.858 --> 16:00.930
Yeah. The last time we saw you,

16:00.930 --> 16:02.132
you two wanted
to kill each other.

16:02.132 --> 16:04.664
-I know! It was so hot!
-(both laugh)

16:04.664 --> 16:06.936
Both:
Ew!

16:06.936 --> 16:08.438
Yeah? Well, the last time
we saw you,

16:08.438 --> 16:09.469
you two were broken up!

16:09.469 --> 16:12.342
Yeah, well, newsflash,
it was a frake-up.

16:13.643 --> 16:15.345
-A what?
-A fake breakup.

16:15.345 --> 16:17.877
Yeah. We did it so you guys
would stop fighting and go home,

16:17.877 --> 16:19.109
and leave us
together at peace.

16:19.109 --> 16:20.210
Oh, clever.

16:20.210 --> 16:21.881
Like memorizing
the alphabet backwards

16:21.881 --> 16:23.053
so you can pass
a sobriety test.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.816
Please tell me this was
just a one-time thing.

16:26.816 --> 16:28.758
Well, I, uh,
I can't speak for Kathy,

16:28.758 --> 16:31.091
but I do find her
to be very attractive.

16:31.091 --> 16:34.294
And Nick is unlike any man
I've ever been with.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.726
He's got the body
of a day-laborer.

16:39.029 --> 16:40.200
No!

16:40.200 --> 16:41.801
No, no, no, no!

16:41.801 --> 16:43.473
This is not happening.
This cannot happen.

16:43.473 --> 16:45.935
Why can't you date
and we date?

16:45.935 --> 16:47.577
Because if you guys
are together,

16:47.577 --> 16:49.239
that kind of makes me and Gabi
brother and sister,

16:49.239 --> 16:50.540
and this isn't Game of Thrones.

16:53.543 --> 16:55.515
So smoke a bowl
and get over it.

16:56.686 --> 16:58.688
No, no, no, Kathy.
I get it.

16:58.688 --> 17:00.250
I've got premium cable.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.523
Look, Gabi, angel, you...

17:03.523 --> 17:05.155
you know I'd do
anything for you,

17:05.155 --> 17:06.856
but it's just been
such a long time

17:06.856 --> 17:08.628
since I've met someone
I really liked,

17:08.628 --> 17:10.800
and I don't want to
give up this amazing woman

17:10.800 --> 17:12.732
unless I know
exactly what it is

17:12.732 --> 17:14.033
I'm giving her up for.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.365
Well, what are you saying, Dad?

17:15.365 --> 17:17.907
What I'm saying is
I need to know

17:17.907 --> 17:19.369
if this thing
is really serious

17:19.369 --> 17:20.770
between you two.

17:20.770 --> 17:22.542
Yes, it's very serious.

17:22.542 --> 17:23.773
Josh?

17:25.145 --> 17:26.176
I'm crazy about her.

17:26.176 --> 17:28.348
Well, I'm sure you've been
crazy about plenty of women.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.750
I just need to know,
is my daughter one
of the plenty?

17:31.751 --> 17:32.822
Absolutely not.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.885
She's different from anyone
I've ever met.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.858
You saying you could
really commit to her?

17:39.959 --> 17:42.692
Yes. Forever.

17:42.692 --> 17:44.033
Oh...

17:45.965 --> 17:49.899
Oh, Joshy, I've never heard you
talk like that about anyone.

17:49.899 --> 17:51.201
(whispers)
Prenup.

17:54.544 --> 17:57.046
All right, well,
since you two really see

17:57.046 --> 17:58.408
a future together,

17:58.408 --> 18:00.950
I guess all I can say is

18:00.950 --> 18:03.753
Kathy, it was
a pleasure meeting you.

18:03.753 --> 18:05.555
You have no idea

18:05.555 --> 18:07.357
what a pleasure
it could have been.

18:07.357 --> 18:08.588
Hm.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.262
In another life perhaps.

18:12.262 --> 18:14.063
-Oh...
-Mom.

18:14.063 --> 18:15.125
(clears throat)

18:16.626 --> 18:18.768
Honey, I will see you
back at your place.

18:18.768 --> 18:19.899
Thanks, Dad.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.731
And you, take care of her.

18:21.731 --> 18:23.333
I know where you live.

18:23.333 --> 18:24.804
I'll walk you downstairs

18:24.804 --> 18:26.276
and give these two
a little privacy.

18:34.244 --> 18:35.215
(ding)

18:40.420 --> 18:42.192
That was just
a frake-up, right?

18:42.192 --> 18:43.353
-(ding)
-Oh, yeah.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.429
Hey, boyfriend.

18:49.429 --> 18:50.960
Hey.

18:53.062 --> 18:54.764
To surviving our parents.

18:57.507 --> 19:00.170
And, uh, to you.

19:00.170 --> 19:03.413
I mean, Josh, some of that stuff
you were saying to my dad,

19:03.413 --> 19:06.316
the forever stuff, I had no idea
that you felt like that.

19:06.316 --> 19:07.717
Yeah.

19:07.717 --> 19:09.449
Neither did I.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.951
Well, I thought that
it was very sweet,

19:15.425 --> 19:16.386
What was that?

19:16.386 --> 19:18.288
What?

19:18.288 --> 19:19.789
You just took a step back.

19:19.789 --> 19:20.990
(scoffs)

19:20.990 --> 19:23.132
No, I didn't.
Get over here.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.236
Oh, my God!

19:26.236 --> 19:28.338
You just did it again but just
with your head this time.

19:28.338 --> 19:30.640
-What's happening?
-Nothing's happening.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.141
You heard what I just
said to your dad.

19:32.141 --> 19:33.573
I told him how serious
I was about you,

19:33.573 --> 19:35.445
that I could see us
spending the rest...

19:35.445 --> 19:36.706
(strains)
of our lives together.

19:39.479 --> 19:40.880
Why are you freaking out?

19:40.880 --> 19:42.111
(strains)
I'm not.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.655
Yes, you are--
Oh, my God.

19:45.655 --> 19:47.587
What if the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree?

19:47.587 --> 19:49.959
What if you're just like
your mom and you're afraid
of commitment?

19:49.959 --> 19:52.762
(strains)
That's ridiculous.

19:52.762 --> 19:54.824
I mean, really, Josh.
I mean, think about it.

19:54.824 --> 19:56.796
Since I've worked here,
you've had a lot
of relationships.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.968
But I wasn't serious
about any of them.

19:58.968 --> 20:00.400
Maybe it's 'cause
you couldn't commit.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.672
I mean, you even broke off
your engagement with Caroline.

20:02.672 --> 20:04.404
To be with you!

20:04.404 --> 20:05.705
I want you!

20:05.705 --> 20:07.437
Okay.

20:07.437 --> 20:10.510
Then kiss me right now
and prove to me that

20:10.510 --> 20:12.682
you're not afraid of commitment
and you're not like your mother.

20:12.682 --> 20:14.083
(scoffs)

20:14.083 --> 20:15.915
You can kiss me, right?

20:15.915 --> 20:17.287
Of course I can!

20:17.287 --> 20:19.048
I'm not my mother.

20:24.394 --> 20:25.995
Oh, my God,
I'm my mother!

20:30.430 --> 20:32.161
Don't go in there.
Don't go in there!

20:32.161 --> 20:33.363
He's got a knife!

20:33.363 --> 20:34.604
(both yelp)

20:34.604 --> 20:35.865
Let the record show

20:35.865 --> 20:38.538
the black lady was not
yelling at the screen!

20:38.538 --> 20:40.039
Right, girl?

20:40.039 --> 20:42.141
Boom!
(laughs)

20:42.141 --> 20:44.314
Alan, you know the actor I was
talking about the other night

20:44.314 --> 20:46.075
but I couldn't
remember his name?

20:46.075 --> 20:47.877
This is him.
Who is this?

20:49.078 --> 20:50.420
Truffle fry?

20:51.981 --> 20:53.623
Want truffle fries?

20:53.623 --> 20:55.625
Girl, you want
some truffle fries?

20:55.625 --> 20:57.256
I know that's right!

21:06.966 --> 21:08.197
I just looked it up!

21:08.197 --> 21:09.399
He dies in the end!

21:09.399 --> 21:10.740
(audience groans)

21:10.740 --> 21:13.343
He dies in the end!
Oh, it's over!

21:13.343 --> 21:14.404
(yells)

21:14.404 --> 21:17.307
-That's so sad!
-I know!

21:17.307 --> 21:19.078
Oh, y'all mad?

21:19.078 --> 21:20.650
-I'm trying to save
y'all some time!
-Why do you gotta die?

21:22.452 --> 21:23.853
I'm trying to
save her some time.

21:23.853 --> 21:26.386
(sobs) I don't want
anybody to die!
