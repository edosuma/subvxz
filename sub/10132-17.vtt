08:13.868 --> 08:16.496
Kimmy, you're doing

08:13.868 --> 08:16.496
so well in Spanish.

08:16.537 --> 08:18.665
You ever think of

08:16.537 --> 08:18.665
moving to Mexico.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.419
Come on, dad.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.419
Class is gonna start.

08:22.461 --> 08:24.838
Now, go in there,

08:22.461 --> 08:24.838
and show no mercy.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.465
Okay, don't worry, Deej.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.008
I'm totally cool.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.807
[exhales]

08:35.849 --> 08:37.725
Excuse me, uh,

08:35.849 --> 08:37.725
Senorita Mosley?

08:39.478 --> 08:41.188
Danny Tanner!

08:41.229 --> 08:42.814
I mean-I mean, Mr. Tanner.

08:42.856 --> 08:47.068
Oh, I love your talk show.

08:42.856 --> 08:47.068
I watch you all the time.

08:47.110 --> 08:49.488
You know, you're taller

08:47.110 --> 08:49.488
than I thought you'd be.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.906
Yeah, well, on TV

08:49.529 --> 08:51.906
I'm only..

08:51.948 --> 08:53.367
...this big.

08:53.408 --> 08:56.119
[laughs]

08:53.408 --> 08:56.119
Oh, you are so funny.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.662
You know, I loved the show

08:56.161 --> 08:57.662
you did last week

08:57.704 --> 08:59.498
where you learned

08:57.704 --> 08:59.498
how to make pizza dough.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.665
Really?

09:00.707 --> 09:02.292
You know, it's harder

09:00.707 --> 09:02.292
than it looks..

09:02.334 --> 09:05.295
...because first you got

09:02.334 --> 09:05.295
to pound the dough.

09:05.337 --> 09:07.130
Dad's really giving it

09:05.337 --> 09:07.130
to her now.

09:08.673 --> 09:11.134
Or you could just pick up

09:08.673 --> 09:11.134
a phone and order one.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.512
[laughs]

09:13.553 --> 09:14.846
Oh, you're so witty.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.224
No wonder

09:14.888 --> 09:17.224
you're such a big star.

09:17.265 --> 09:20.018
Oh, well, I wouldn't

09:17.265 --> 09:20.018
call myself a big star..

09:20.060 --> 09:21.395
...but you just did.

09:21.436 --> 09:22.979
It'd be pretty silly

09:21.436 --> 09:22.979
for me to argue, huh?

09:23.021 --> 09:24.731
[laughs]

09:24.772 --> 09:26.483
Well, it's nice meeting you.

09:26.525 --> 09:28.109
(Linda)

09:26.525 --> 09:28.109
'Nice meeting you.'

09:30.070 --> 09:31.905
Oh, wait, um..

09:33.240 --> 09:35.658
...I came here to talk

09:33.240 --> 09:35.658
about D.J.'s grade.

09:36.617 --> 09:37.994
Why did she get a D?

09:38.036 --> 09:40.621
You know, she started out

09:38.036 --> 09:40.621
getting B's and C's

09:40.663 --> 09:42.957
but then as the work got harder

09:40.663 --> 09:42.957
she got discouraged

09:42.999 --> 09:44.834
and she simply stopped trying.

09:44.876 --> 09:45.960
Well, I was wondering.

09:44.876 --> 09:45.960
Do you think--

09:46.002 --> 09:47.337
[bell ringing]

09:47.379 --> 09:49.130
Oh, look, I'm sorry.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.130
Class is starting.

09:49.172 --> 09:51.341
You know, I'd be happy

09:49.172 --> 09:51.341
to stop by after school

09:51.383 --> 09:54.928
and set up a study program

09:51.383 --> 09:54.928
to help D.J. catch up.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.388
Really?

09:56.430 --> 09:58.348
I'd appreciate that.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.348
Thank you.

09:58.390 --> 10:00.183
Oh, I'm here to help.

10:00.225 --> 10:02.894
Well, until later.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.146
<i>Hasta luego.</i>

10:05.188 --> 10:07.023
Uh,<i> el pollo loco.</i>

10:09.650 --> 10:11.236
- Bye.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.449
So what's my new grade?

10:15.490 --> 10:17.534
A, A+, A-?

10:18.826 --> 10:20.370
D.

10:20.412 --> 10:21.662
D?

10:21.704 --> 10:23.664
That's the grade I had.

10:23.706 --> 10:26.000
I thought you were on my side.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.294
I am, D.J.

10:27.335 --> 10:28.920
Senorita Mosley thinks

10:27.335 --> 10:28.920
she can help

10:28.962 --> 10:30.338
you bring up that D.

10:30.380 --> 10:31.965
We'll talk about this

10:30.380 --> 10:31.965
after school.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.760
Yummy in the tummy.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.764
That was good, Michelle,

10:37.887 --> 10:39.764
but next time try it

10:39.806 --> 10:42.601
with a little more energy,

10:39.806 --> 10:42.601
nice and loud.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.352
Yummy and the tummy!

10:45.853 --> 10:47.063
Joey, what are you doing?

10:47.105 --> 10:48.189
You're turning my sweet,

10:47.105 --> 10:48.189
little Michelle

10:48.231 --> 10:49.690
into Sam Kinison.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.901
Come on, Michelle.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.901
Grab your wardrobe.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.320
We're gonna make

10:51.943 --> 10:53.320
that Gerber baby

10:53.361 --> 10:54.946
wanna hang up

10:53.361 --> 10:54.946
her booties.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.074
(Jesse)

10:56.490 --> 10:58.074
Come on. Come on.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.578
And we'll label

10:59.242 --> 11:01.578
the door<i> la puerta.</i>

11:01.620 --> 11:02.996
<i>La puerta.</i>

11:03.037 --> 11:04.831
See you later, Danny.

11:03.037 --> 11:04.831
Nice meeting you, Linda.

11:04.872 --> 11:06.500
<i>El gusto es mio.</i>

11:06.541 --> 11:08.585
Right back

11:06.541 --> 11:08.585
at you.

11:08.627 --> 11:10.504
Oh, wait a minute.

11:10.545 --> 11:13.173
Oh, good luck, Michelle.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.257
And when you're a big star

11:14.299 --> 11:15.716
remember who changed

11:14.299 --> 11:15.716
your diapers

11:15.758 --> 11:17.552
all those years.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.179
- Me.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.057
Come on, let's keep labeling.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.559
This is really a fun way

11:23.099 --> 11:24.559
for D.J.

11:24.601 --> 11:27.562
to help build

11:24.601 --> 11:27.562
her Spanish vocabulary.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.105
This is<i> el sofa.</i>

11:30.357 --> 11:33.109
The sofa is<i> el sofa?</i>

11:33.151 --> 11:34.986
How could she get

11:33.151 --> 11:34.986
a D in this language?

11:36.070 --> 11:40.200
Well, they're not

11:36.070 --> 11:40.200
all that easy.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.785
Oh.<i> "Perro."</i>

11:42.827 --> 11:44.371
That means two of, right?

11:44.412 --> 11:46.414
As in you have

11:44.412 --> 11:46.414
a lovely<i> perro</i> eyes.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.749
[laughing]

11:50.502 --> 11:53.213
That's very sweet of you,

11:50.502 --> 11:53.213
but no it means dog

11:53.254 --> 11:55.298
and it's pronounced<i> perro.</i>

11:55.340 --> 11:57.842
The double R is very important

11:55.340 --> 11:57.842
in the Spanish language.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.386
It rolls.

11:59.427 --> 12:00.887
R-r-r-r.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.097
Ar-ra-ra-r-r.

12:04.683 --> 12:06.351
Come on.

12:04.683 --> 12:06.351
Try it with me.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.144
<i>Perro.</i>

12:08.186 --> 12:09.770
<i>Perro.</i>

12:09.812 --> 12:11.189
<i>Perro.</i>

12:11.231 --> 12:12.524
You need more lips.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.442
Now, watch my mouth.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.277
<i>Perro.</i>

12:16.319 --> 12:18.655
<i>Pera-ro.</i>

12:18.697 --> 12:20.532
<i>Perro.</i>

12:20.574 --> 12:21.782
<i>Pera-ro.</i>

12:22.741 --> 12:24.869
<i>Perro.</i>

12:24.911 --> 12:26.745
<i>Per...ro.</i>

12:33.127 --> 12:34.629
<i>Caramba!</i>

12:38.466 --> 12:40.176
I'm sorry.

12:40.218 --> 12:41.553
Oh, no, no.

12:41.595 --> 12:45.181
Linda, wait a minute.

12:41.595 --> 12:45.181
Don't-don't be sor-r-r-ry.

12:47.766 --> 12:49.686
That felt nice.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.229
[laughing]

12:55.816 --> 12:57.318
Whoa, baby!

13:00.947 --> 13:02.907
So that's why

13:00.947 --> 13:02.907
you took her side.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.909
Thanks for sticking up

13:02.949 --> 13:04.909
for me dad.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.038
[instrumental music]

13:10.665 --> 13:12.459
[music continues]

13:15.211 --> 13:16.671
[knock on door]

13:17.922 --> 13:19.048
[sighs]

13:19.090 --> 13:20.341
D.J.

13:20.383 --> 13:23.136
Something tells me

13:20.383 --> 13:23.136
we need to talk.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.887
There's nothing

13:23.177 --> 13:24.887
to talk about.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.847
You kissed my teacher.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.350
You kissed Mr. Zambruski?

13:31.227 --> 13:33.480
No. I kissed

13:31.227 --> 13:33.480
Senorita Mosley.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.398
You kissed a teacher.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.733
Eww!

13:36.775 --> 13:37.942
Oops.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.361
There I go again.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.361
Chattering away.

13:40.403 --> 13:41.904
Silly me.

13:44.741 --> 13:45.784
I can't believe

13:44.741 --> 13:45.784
you sold out

13:45.824 --> 13:48.202
your own daughter

13:45.824 --> 13:48.202
for a kiss.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.828
That's not

13:48.244 --> 13:49.828
what happened.

13:51.289 --> 13:53.249
You said you were

13:51.289 --> 13:53.249
on my side.

13:53.291 --> 13:56.002
Let's get a few things

13:53.291 --> 13:56.002
straight here.

13:56.043 --> 13:57.378
My kissing Senorita Mosley

13:57.420 --> 13:58.921
had nothing to do

13:57.420 --> 13:58.921
with you.

14:00.674 --> 14:03.217
Kissing her...was a mistake

14:03.259 --> 14:05.595
and it will

14:03.259 --> 14:05.595
never happen again.

14:05.637 --> 14:08.598
But that has nothing to do

14:05.637 --> 14:08.598
with your D in Spanish.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.600
Dad forget my grade.

14:10.642 --> 14:12.310
You kissed my teacher..

14:12.352 --> 14:13.852
...and all my friends saw it.

14:14.895 --> 14:16.230
Look..

14:16.272 --> 14:17.774
...parents make mistakes too.

14:19.609 --> 14:22.195
I don't know

14:19.609 --> 14:22.195
what else to say.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.531
You're just gonna have

14:22.236 --> 14:24.531
to accept my apology.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.327
Fine. Apology accepted.

14:30.077 --> 14:31.579
Excuse me.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.874
That went well.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.086
Alright, uh, the lighting

14:39.128 --> 14:40.797
is a little harsh.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.797
Can you turn it down, please?

14:40.839 --> 14:42.590
You're starting

14:40.839 --> 14:42.590
to toast my marshmallows.

14:42.632 --> 14:44.217
Thank you very much.

14:42.632 --> 14:44.217
You're a nice kid.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.761
Don't change.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.761
Alright, let me see.

14:46.803 --> 14:47.846
Yeah!

14:47.887 --> 14:48.888
Look at our son.

14:48.929 --> 14:50.598
Such a big shot now.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.392
Seems like just yesterday

14:52.433 --> 14:54.977
I diapered

14:52.433 --> 14:54.977
this little...tushy.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.187
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:56.229 --> 14:57.856
Mother, please,

14:56.229 --> 14:57.856
with my tushy?

14:57.938 --> 15:00.191
I have to work

14:57.938 --> 15:00.191
with these people, huh?

15:00.233 --> 15:01.359
What are you guys doing here?

15:01.401 --> 15:03.737
Oh, you asked us

15:01.401 --> 15:03.737
to pick up Michelle.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.905
Yes, at six o'clock.

15:05.946 --> 15:06.989
It's only four, mother.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.074
Oh!

15:08.115 --> 15:09.534
Are we early?

15:09.576 --> 15:11.786
Irene, you have

15:09.576 --> 15:11.786
a camera around your neck.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.204
You're not fooling anybody.

15:13.246 --> 15:16.082
Okay, okay.

15:13.246 --> 15:16.082
We came to see Michelle.

15:16.123 --> 15:18.585
Where is our little superstar?

15:18.626 --> 15:21.629
Step aside please.

15:18.626 --> 15:21.629
Make way for Miss Tanner.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.427
Hey, babe.

15:28.469 --> 15:30.012
[laughing]

15:30.054 --> 15:32.807
"Hey, babe." I told you

15:30.054 --> 15:32.807
you'd get a laugh with that.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.475
No please, no autographs.

15:34.517 --> 15:36.936
Miss Tanner can't write.

15:36.977 --> 15:39.814
Look at this little cutie pie.

15:36.977 --> 15:39.814
She's like..

15:39.856 --> 15:42.817
Irene, who's that redhead

15:39.856 --> 15:42.817
I like on "Gilligan's Island?"

15:42.859 --> 15:44.819
Not Mary Ann.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.819
The movie star.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.529
- Tina Louise.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.529
- That's right.

15:46.571 --> 15:49.407
She's a teeny-tiny Tina.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.118
- And look at that little tushy.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.118
- No mo-whoa, whoa!

15:52.159 --> 15:55.162
Mother, do you have

15:52.159 --> 15:55.162
to grab everyone's tushy?

15:55.204 --> 15:57.081
Come on, Irene.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.207
Alright.

15:58.249 --> 15:59.793
Here we go

15:58.249 --> 15:59.793
little angel.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.043
Okay, now, what you do

16:01.085 --> 16:03.129
you sit up here on the

16:01.085 --> 16:03.129
marshmallow..

16:03.170 --> 16:05.256
...and..

16:05.298 --> 16:06.466
Ma!

16:06.507 --> 16:08.008
Okay, okay.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.847
Stand by everyone.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.432
- 'Stand by, everyone.'

16:12.889 --> 16:14.432
- We're almost ready.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.392
- Okay, ready.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.392
- To make marshmallow magic.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.352
That's it.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.352
Marshmallow magic.

16:18.394 --> 16:21.063
Okay, Michelle,

16:18.394 --> 16:21.063
let's show Mr. Malatesta

16:21.105 --> 16:22.982
just how we practiced it.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.486
No more.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.614
[laughs]

16:29.656 --> 16:31.532
This is just how

16:29.656 --> 16:31.532
she warms up.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.534
That's right.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.534
She-she throws one first.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.077
Meryl Streep,

16:33.576 --> 16:35.077
same technique.

16:36.913 --> 16:39.248
Okay, Michelle,

16:36.913 --> 16:39.248
remember, "Yummy in the tummy."

16:39.707 --> 16:41.709
Yucky.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.878
[laughs]

16:43.920 --> 16:46.339
It sounded like

16:43.920 --> 16:46.339
she said "Yucky."

16:46.380 --> 16:48.382
Tummy full.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.051
Uh, well, see,

16:49.717 --> 16:51.051
what's happened, sir

16:51.093 --> 16:52.345
is she's rehearsed all day.

16:52.386 --> 16:53.930
She went through

16:52.386 --> 16:53.930
a whole bag of these.

16:53.972 --> 16:56.140
Oh, hey. I understand.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.684
It happens.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.143
Dump the baby.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.269
See if you can

16:59.185 --> 17:00.269
get me that baby

17:00.311 --> 17:02.188
from the dog food commercial.

17:02.229 --> 17:04.440
Sir, let her digest.

17:04.482 --> 17:05.566
Is this guy crazy?

17:05.608 --> 17:07.234
This is the next

17:05.608 --> 17:07.234
Tina Louise.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.904
Nicky, let me talk to him.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.904
I can be nice.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.364
Mother, that's my boss.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.907
Don't touch his tushy.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.119
Oh, Michelle,

17:14.742 --> 17:17.119
you were terrific.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.622
We just let you eat

17:17.161 --> 17:19.622
too many marshmallows.

17:19.664 --> 17:21.582
Now, don't

17:19.664 --> 17:21.582
take this personally.

17:21.624 --> 17:22.792
You're fired.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.544
- You're fired.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.544
- No, you're fired.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.253
- No, you.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.421
- No.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.923
Give me a kiss.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.009
- You're still fired.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.593
- You're fired.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.680
[instrumental music]

17:38.307 --> 17:41.060
Come on, Steph. We made your

17:38.307 --> 17:41.060
all time favorite lunch.

17:41.101 --> 17:43.187
Peanut butter, jelly

17:41.101 --> 17:43.187
and banana.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.359
Joey, we got to get

17:46.774 --> 17:48.359
that kid to talk.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.611
I have no idea what's going

17:48.401 --> 17:50.611
on in the first grade.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.241
Come on, D.J., you're

17:52.906 --> 17:55.241
gonna be late for school.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.410
Oh, I don't wanna

17:55.282 --> 17:57.410
go to school.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.328
I feel sick.

17:59.370 --> 18:00.914
D.J., you're not sick.

18:00.955 --> 18:02.289
You're worried that the kids

18:00.955 --> 18:02.289
are gonna tease you

18:02.331 --> 18:04.834
about your dad

18:02.331 --> 18:04.834
kissing your teacher, right?

18:04.876 --> 18:06.920
Oh, yeah.

18:06.961 --> 18:09.756
Well, I'll tell you the

18:06.961 --> 18:09.756
perfect way to handle this.

18:09.797 --> 18:12.132
What you do is you go in

18:09.797 --> 18:12.132
and you tell a bunch of jokes

18:12.174 --> 18:13.593
about your dad

18:12.174 --> 18:13.593
kissing your teacher.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.386
That way, it's no fun

18:13.634 --> 18:15.386
to tease you

18:15.428 --> 18:17.388
'cause you beat 'em

18:15.428 --> 18:17.388
to the punch line.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.098
But I don't know any jokes.

18:19.139 --> 18:20.767
I'll help you

18:19.139 --> 18:20.767
write 'em.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.351
You know, when

18:20.808 --> 18:22.351
I was in sixth grade..

18:22.393 --> 18:23.895
...I had a face

18:22.393 --> 18:23.895
full of zits.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.897
- Nobody teased me.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.897
- Why not?

18:25.939 --> 18:27.648
Beat up the first guy

18:25.939 --> 18:27.648
who said somethin'.

18:29.734 --> 18:30.944
Yeah, actually it might be

18:29.734 --> 18:30.944
best to go

18:30.985 --> 18:32.904
with Joey's plan

18:30.985 --> 18:32.904
in this case.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.490
Linda, it's not that

18:36.532 --> 18:38.576
I'm not attracted to you.

18:38.618 --> 18:39.702
I just think

18:39.744 --> 18:41.788
it's inappropriate

18:39.744 --> 18:41.788
for us to date

18:41.829 --> 18:43.748
while you're D.J.'s teacher.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.165
You're right.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.293
Why did I kiss you?

18:47.334 --> 18:49.921
How could I do

18:47.334 --> 18:49.921
such a horrible thing?

18:49.963 --> 18:51.422
I just said

18:49.963 --> 18:51.422
it was inappropriate.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.049
I didn't think

18:51.464 --> 18:53.049
it was repulsive.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.011
I meant I shouldn't

18:55.134 --> 18:57.011
be involved

18:57.053 --> 18:58.972
with a student's parent.

18:59.013 --> 19:00.180
And I don't wanna put D.J.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.391
in an awkward position.

19:02.433 --> 19:04.018
But you know

19:02.433 --> 19:04.018
I'll only be her teacher

19:04.060 --> 19:05.895
for three more months.

19:05.937 --> 19:07.772
We'll have dinner

19:05.937 --> 19:07.772
the day she graduates.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.231
[laughs]

19:07.814 --> 19:09.231
You're on.

19:09.273 --> 19:10.566
I better slip out

19:09.273 --> 19:10.566
the back door.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.318
Oh, Danny, Danny,

19:10.608 --> 19:12.318
that's the..

19:12.359 --> 19:13.486
...closet.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.529
[indistinct chatter]

19:15.571 --> 19:17.197
<i>Buenos dias, estudiantes.</i>

19:17.239 --> 19:19.784
Ah, let's not get settled yet.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.578
You know, we're gonna take

19:19.826 --> 19:22.578
a field trip to the cafeteria

19:22.620 --> 19:25.873
to learn the Spanish words for

19:22.620 --> 19:25.873
knife, fork and mystery meat.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.793
(all)

19:27.500 --> 19:28.793
Ooh.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.378
<i>Clase, por favor.</i>

19:31.420 --> 19:33.798
Uh, that's okay,

19:31.420 --> 19:33.798
Senorita Mosley.

19:35.008 --> 19:37.593
"Ooh." That's the best

19:35.008 --> 19:37.593
you can do?

19:37.635 --> 19:39.219
You guys need some help.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.680
Uh, how about this?

19:40.721 --> 19:42.222
- Knock, knock.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.222
- Who's there?

19:42.264 --> 19:43.808
- Deej.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.808
- Deej, who?

19:43.850 --> 19:45.810
Did you see my father

19:43.850 --> 19:45.810
kiss the teacher?

19:45.852 --> 19:47.478
[laughs]

19:47.520 --> 19:50.606
- D.J.--

19:47.520 --> 19:50.606
- Oh, no. You'll love this one.

19:50.648 --> 19:54.276
Why does my father wear "I love

19:50.648 --> 19:54.276
Senorita Mosley" suspenders?

19:54.318 --> 19:55.820
To keep my grades up.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.196
[laughs]

19:57.237 --> 19:59.699
Okay,<i> clase,</i>

19:57.237 --> 19:59.699
<i>vamos a la cafeteria.</i>

20:01.367 --> 20:03.036
Oh, hi, Deej.

20:03.077 --> 20:05.412
(all)

20:03.077 --> 20:05.412
Ooh.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.915
What did I ever do to you?

20:07.957 --> 20:10.877
Class, this isn't

20:07.957 --> 20:10.877
what you think.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.003
That's right.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.295
Well, guys, I'm sure

20:13.337 --> 20:15.548
you've all seen

20:13.337 --> 20:15.548
my TV show every day.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.216
We're doing a special

20:17.257 --> 20:20.761
on great closets

20:17.257 --> 20:20.761
in San Francisco.

20:20.803 --> 20:23.097
When will that closet

20:20.803 --> 20:23.097
special be on, Mr. Tanner?

20:24.807 --> 20:26.308
I'll let you know, Kimmy.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.644
Thanks for asking.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.273
Amazing. That guy looks

20:30.730 --> 20:33.273
just like my dad.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.947
Dad, why did you hide

20:38.320 --> 20:39.947
in the closet?

20:39.989 --> 20:42.575
That's the first place

20:39.989 --> 20:42.575
everyone looks.

20:42.616 --> 20:43.659
I wasn't hiding.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.912
I was trying to leave.

20:45.953 --> 20:49.123
D.J., do you remember

20:45.953 --> 20:49.123
that speech I gave you

20:49.165 --> 20:51.291
about parents

20:49.165 --> 20:51.291
making mistakes.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.585
Mm-hmm.

20:52.626 --> 20:53.669
You want to hear it again?

20:53.711 --> 20:55.171
Nuh-uh.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.717
Look, I just want you

20:57.631 --> 20:59.717
to know that

20:59.759 --> 21:02.302
I'm not gonna see Linda

20:59.759 --> 21:02.302
while she's your teacher.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.889
And I'm really sorry, again

21:04.931 --> 21:06.807
that I embarrassed you...again.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.143
But I think

21:07.934 --> 21:09.143
we should talk about

21:09.185 --> 21:10.937
what started this whole mess.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.772
That you wouldn't

21:10.978 --> 21:12.772
get my grade changed.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.733
You know you deserved that D.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.988
[sighs]

21:18.444 --> 21:20.988
Alright.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.448
Maybe I just sort of gave up.

21:23.741 --> 21:25.910
But let's face it.

21:23.741 --> 21:25.910
I'm no good in Spanish.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.746
Hold it, Deej.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.957
Come here.

21:30.998 --> 21:32.625
Look..

21:32.666 --> 21:35.335
...honey, I understand

21:32.666 --> 21:35.335
it's frustrating.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.713
So many things come

21:35.377 --> 21:37.713
so easily to you..

21:37.755 --> 21:39.799
...but not everything will.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.175
And if you give up on something

21:41.217 --> 21:42.927
just 'cause it's difficult..

21:42.969 --> 21:45.763
...you're gonna miss out

21:42.969 --> 21:45.763
on a lot that's valuable.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.640
There's no better feeling..

21:47.681 --> 21:48.766
...than conquering something

21:48.808 --> 21:51.185
that's really hard for you.

21:51.227 --> 21:53.271
You know what I mean?

21:53.312 --> 21:54.939
Yeah.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.732
But what if I work

21:54.981 --> 21:56.732
as hard as I can

21:56.774 --> 21:59.401
and I still can't

21:56.774 --> 21:59.401
get an A?

21:59.443 --> 22:00.444
Then I'll be proud of you

22:00.486 --> 22:01.988
for working as hard

22:00.486 --> 22:01.988
as you can.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.532
Okay, I'll try.

22:06.408 --> 22:07.367
Thanks.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.203
That's<i> gracias.</i>

22:09.245 --> 22:11.289
You're a<i> padre muy bueno.</i>

22:12.665 --> 22:14.125
Huh?

22:15.293 --> 22:17.086
That means

22:15.293 --> 22:17.086
you're a great dad.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.131
[laughs]

22:21.257 --> 22:23.050
Come on, Steph.

22:23.092 --> 22:24.510
I can't take the silence.

22:25.636 --> 22:28.014
Please, I miss

22:25.636 --> 22:28.014
the old chatterbox.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.682
Let's hear a little chatter.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.433
Are you sure?

22:31.475 --> 22:32.935
Yeah, are you guys sure?

22:34.603 --> 22:37.148
We wanna hear everything

22:34.603 --> 22:37.148
that happened today.

22:37.190 --> 22:39.441
I think I'll go do

22:37.190 --> 22:39.441
my Spanish homework.

22:41.235 --> 22:43.070
Okay, boys, have a seat.

22:45.614 --> 22:47.783
Okay, this morning

22:45.614 --> 22:47.783
Mr. Gibbler

22:47.825 --> 22:49.409
ran his car

22:47.825 --> 22:49.409
over a garbage can

22:49.451 --> 22:53.122
then got TV dinner trays

22:49.451 --> 22:53.122
all over the street.

22:53.164 --> 22:54.207
You don't say.

22:54.248 --> 22:55.708
I do say.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.004
Then I saw a dog that looked

22:57.877 --> 23:00.004
just like a lion.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.547
I thought it was a lion

23:01.588 --> 23:03.216
but then Mrs. Norton came out

23:01.588 --> 23:03.216
and hit it on the head

23:03.257 --> 23:04.258
with a newspaper

23:04.300 --> 23:05.343
and then it barked.

23:05.383 --> 23:07.678
So I was pretty sure

23:05.383 --> 23:07.678
it was a dog.

23:07.720 --> 23:08.929
Really?

23:08.971 --> 23:10.430
Would I make that up?

23:12.975 --> 23:14.977
And did you hear what happened

23:12.975 --> 23:14.977
to Virginia Gauding?

23:15.019 --> 23:17.063
She got $5

23:15.019 --> 23:17.063
from the tooth fairy.

23:17.104 --> 23:18.856
Must've been a big tooth.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.692
Are my teeth too small or do

23:18.898 --> 23:21.692
I have a cheap tooth fairy?
