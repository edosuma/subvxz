So when I called in sick
this morning,

00:06.716 --> 00:09.503
I hung upside down
in gravity boots so my voice
would sound all nasally.

00:09.594 --> 00:12.552
[Laughs]
For me, it’s all about
the set-up the day before.

00:12.638 --> 00:15.505
A well-planted cough here,
a sneeze there.

00:15.600 --> 00:18.387

02:15.011 --> 02:16.922
Let’s just
focus on the work.
All right, buddy?

02:17.013 --> 02:19.174
Victim is male, judging by
the heart—shaped pelvic inlet.

02:19.265 --> 02:22.974
Right, not to mention
his oversized wedding ring
right there on the left hand.

02:23.060 --> 02:26.723
- Can we hurry this up, Bones?
- Do you have another murder

from England today.
His plane lands at 11:00.

[ Hodgins ]
Oh, right. Parker’s been
gone for a while, right?

02:33.154 --> 02:36.317
Actually, four months.
I hope he’s not
calling soccer football.

02:36.449 --> 02:39.407
Parker’s very excited
to meet his new sister.
I can imagine.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.825
And a new house,
a new room.

02:41.912 --> 02:44.779
I bet he gets to buy
a new toy every now and then.

02:44.874 --> 02:46.159
Right. Okay.

02:46.250 --> 02:48.787
Given the size
of this blowfly larvae,

02:48.919 --> 02:52.047
I’d say our victim died
three days ago.
Great. Perfect.

02:52.131 --> 02:54.668
Let’s bag this puppy up
and get it back
to the Jeffersonian.

02:54.759 --> 02:56.420
I don’t wanna leave
Parker stranded.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.126
- We’re still missing
the victim’s head, Booth.
- You really need that?

02:59.221 --> 03:01.507
Right. Okay. That was
a bad question. Okay.

03:01.599 --> 03:04.386
Tell you what.
You look over there,
and I’ll look over here.

03:04.477 --> 03:05.967
We have to be methodical.

03:06.062 --> 03:10.055
Skull retrieval
requires the use
of physics, anatomy...

03:10.149 --> 03:12.811
and the careful reading
of geological terrain.

03:12.902 --> 03:15.018
That sounds like it’s
gonna take a long time,
and I gotta—

03:15.112 --> 03:19.105
Since the head is commonly
the first to dislodge
during decomp,

03:19.200 --> 03:22.158
it could have
washed down the hill
during last night’s rain.

03:22.244 --> 03:24.701
These rivulets
from the downpour
probably acted as troughs.

03:24.789 --> 03:26.780
Great. Okay, so it’s
somewhere down there.
Let’s go.

03:26.874 --> 03:30.537
To the untrained eye, yes.
But I can actually analyze
the viscosity of the mud.

03:30.628 --> 03:33.085
And factor in the orifices
in the human head...

03:33.172 --> 03:36.881
that can catch
or snag on debris
and alter its course.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.458

10:14.656 --> 10:16.738
and I found more
than we bargained for.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.534
[ Hodgins ]
That looks like
the tip of a weapon.

10:20.621 --> 10:21.906
It was lodged deep
in the bone.

10:21.997 --> 10:24.283
If the victim was stabbed
in a front-facing attack,

10:24.374 --> 10:26.160
we should be able to figure out
the length of the weapon.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.037
At least seven inches long.

10:28.128 --> 10:32.792
That would definitely
have severed the right common
and external iliac arteries.

10:32.925 --> 10:35.507
You found cause
of death, dude.
That I did, bro.

10:35.636 --> 10:38.378
Can you determine
what the metal is?
[Hodgins ] Sure.

10:38.472 --> 10:41.964
Yeah, I will use
my new mass spec,
which I intend to keep.

10:42.059 --> 10:44.971
Uh, it’ll narrow down—
lt’ll determine
the tensile strength,

10:45.062 --> 10:49.055
and I can also use it
to narrow down
what he was stabbed with.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.810
What?

10:50.901 --> 10:55.235
[ Booth ] Right. Just call when
you find out the tool truck’s
next stop. Thanks.

10:55.322 --> 10:59.361
They should have
the guy’s route,
so he should be close by.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.487
I think when we get home,

11:01.578 --> 11:04.570
we should do something
together as a family...

11:04.665 --> 11:06.155
since Parker’s home now.

11:06.250 --> 11:09.162
Great. Great.
I love that idea.
Like what?

11:09.294 --> 11:12.001
Well, there’s a wooded area
behind the house.
Yeah.

11:12.089 --> 11:16.332
I thought we could
search for carrion and
rearticulate their skeletons.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.212
You know, a family project.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.965
Really?
Wh—What do you
do with them?

11:21.056 --> 11:24.890
We could mount them
and then hang them up
as decoration.

11:24.977 --> 11:26.842
Or we can just have
dinner together.

11:26.937 --> 11:29.929
Maybe the place
with the bottomless bowl
of breadsticks.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.433
Everybody
loves breadsticks.

11:31.525 --> 11:34.392
I thought a project might
bring us together as a family...

11:34.486 --> 11:38.604
and might help make the adjustment
easier for Parker.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.906
What do you mean,
adjustment?
Parker’s fine.

11:40.993 --> 11:44.326
Since siblings can develop
acrimonious rivalries—

11:44.413 --> 11:47.029
I know.
I appreciate the thought.
I really do, Bones.

11:47.124 --> 11:51.709
But I really don’t think playing
with dead animals is gonna
make things all that better.

11:51.795 --> 11:54.081
If you think breadsticks
are enough—

11:54.172 --> 11:56.584
Garlic ones? Yeah.
[Cell Phone Ringing]

11:56.675 --> 11:58.085
Please.

11:58.176 --> 11:59.837
[Beeps]
Booth.

11:59.928 --> 12:02.920
Okay. That’s great.
We’re about, uh,
two minutes away. Thanks.

12:03.015 --> 12:06.553
Guy’s truck is about
a half mile from here.
We’re good.

12:06.643 --> 12:09.305
And, Bones, listen, thanks
for worrying about Parker.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.567
[Men Chuckling]

12:17.654 --> 12:20.612
Judging by the size
of the crowd, it seems
a very lucrative business.

12:20.699 --> 12:23.031
Spark & Steel specializes
in high-end tools.

12:23.118 --> 12:24.983
A truck like this would
give him a nice income—

12:25.078 --> 12:27.364
extra nice
if he added a route.

12:27.456 --> 12:28.912
So there I was,
about 20 minutes left.

12:28.999 --> 12:31.081
I hadn’t caught so much
as a guppy all day long.

12:31.168 --> 12:34.911
Karl Singler? F.B.l.
Save that whopper story for later.

12:35.005 --> 12:38.247
- Okay, let’s go. Clear out, guys.
Get back to work.
- Excuse us. Thank you.

12:38.342 --> 12:40.958
I don’t know what this is about,
but I don’t lie about fishin’.

12:41.053 --> 12:43.339
I got this belt
for winning
the trout classic.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.672
- What’d you get yours for?
- To hold my pants up.

12:46.767 --> 12:49.759
We have some questions
about Tony Cole.

12:49.853 --> 12:52.185
What about him?
Little guy get himself
into some trouble?

12:52.272 --> 12:56.390
No, he got himself murdered.
Rumor has it you wanted him
out of your way.

12:56.485 --> 12:59.818
- That’s just not true.
- You were trying to steal
his route, weren’t you?

12:59.905 --> 13:01.816
Look, the economy’s
not so great right now.

13:01.907 --> 13:05.024
So we were competing
for clients, yeah, but
th-that doesn’t mean murder.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.983
Financial gain?
That’s a good motive
in my book.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.656
Definitely.
Where were you
last Friday?

13:08.747 --> 13:10.658
Friday l was, uh—
I was at work all day.

13:10.749 --> 13:12.910
And at night,
l was playing poker,
which I won.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.832
I got witnesses,
purchase orders.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.785
We believe
the victim was stabbed...

13:16.880 --> 13:19.166
with a metal implement
measuring at least seven inches.

13:19.257 --> 13:22.169
Do you have any tools
matching that description
in your truck?

13:22.260 --> 13:24.797
Metal? Seven inches?
What, are you kidding?

13:24.888 --> 13:26.389
No.

13:28.141 --> 13:32.555
I’ve got awls, picks, scribes,
screwdrivers, handsaws,

13:32.646 --> 13:35.558
Swiss needle files, chisels,
drill bits, hammers.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.480
Knock yourselves out.

13:38.568 --> 13:39.899
Wow.

13:42.906 --> 13:44.862
[ Sweets ]
Consider the victim’s profile.

13:44.950 --> 13:47.862
I mean, here’s a guy
who was bullied
his entire life.

13:47.953 --> 13:50.990
He subjugated his own
feelings of inadequacy
by wearing lifts,

13:51.081 --> 13:53.288
choosing an overtly
masculine profession.

13:53.375 --> 13:56.162
Oh, okay, so he wanted
to be a— a guy’s guy.

13:56.253 --> 13:58.869
I’m liking this so far.
Keep going. Don’t stop.
Come on. Come on.

13:58.964 --> 14:01.330
Now, commonly that means
that he wouldn’t want to
talk about his problems...

14:01.425 --> 14:03.381
with any woman,
even his wife.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.845
Right, because
it would make him
look less like a man.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.591
Yeah. I would’ve said
that it was a gender role
compliance advantage, but—

14:08.682 --> 14:10.843
No one will understand what
you’re talking about, Sweets.

14:10.934 --> 14:13.391
Okay, well, he was
close with his son.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.764
His wife said that
he was helping his kid
with karate.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.097
Probably didn’t want him
to get bullied the same way
that he did,

14:18.191 --> 14:20.227
which would explain this.

14:21.111 --> 14:22.521
It’s a police report...

14:22.612 --> 14:24.694
filed the day before
Tony was murdered.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.396
He tried to instigate a fight.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.148
With the karate teacher.
Mm-hmm.

14:28.243 --> 14:30.950
- Why didn’t you just lead with this?
- I’m sorry.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.745
But look who made
the 911 call.

14:33.832 --> 14:34.992
His son?

14:35.083 --> 14:38.621
Batter up.
Time to get shrinky with the kid.

14:40.130 --> 14:42.667
Hey, so the metal fragment
is an alloy...

14:42.758 --> 14:45.966
comprised of iron,
chromium, nickel,
molybdenum...

14:46.053 --> 14:47.964
and just a pinch
of carbon.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.591
Ah, stainless steel.

14:49.681 --> 14:52.388
That means it could be
one of the tools that Booth
and Dr. Brennan found.

14:52.476 --> 14:54.387
Yeah, but
the tensile strength
wouldn’t match.

14:54.478 --> 14:56.810
We’re looking
for a knife with
a relatively thin blade.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.680
This could be a penknife.
I’ve never seen
a seven-inch penknife.

14:59.775 --> 15:01.936
- All right, well,
I’m gonna keep workin’ on it.
- Dr. Hodgins.

15:02.027 --> 15:03.483
Yeah?

15:03.570 --> 15:06.312
I would love to be able
to give you all the equipment
you desire,

15:06.406 --> 15:08.613
but the Jeffersonian’s
suffering from cutbacks...

15:08.700 --> 15:10.406
just like every other
government agency.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.821
They’ve even canceled
the Founder’s Day party.
What?

15:12.913 --> 15:14.699
There’s always
a Founder’s Day party.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.288
Not this year.
Who do these bozos
think they are?

15:17.417 --> 15:21.376
Don’t they realize that
by spending on a party,
we’re actually fueling the economy?

15:21.463 --> 15:25.502
You know, creating
demand for, like, booze
and-and food and a deejay.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.834
I mean, come on!
This is simple
Keynesian economics.

15:28.929 --> 15:31.090
Sorry. No party.

15:31.181 --> 15:32.546
God!

15:32.641 --> 15:34.472
Don’t you just hate
the neoclassicists?

15:36.728 --> 15:38.184
Come on!

15:38.271 --> 15:40.227
What is this country
coming to? Seriously.

15:40.690 --> 15:44.023
Can you tell me
why you called 911,
Danny?

15:46.696 --> 15:48.778
I got into a fight
after school one day.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.821
It was with
my sensei’s kid, Blake.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.945
Mm-hmm.
It was my fault.

15:53.078 --> 15:56.616
No, it-it wasn’t.
It was a misunderstanding.
No.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.287
I started it.

15:58.375 --> 16:01.742
I thought maybe if I could
take Blake down, that Dad—

16:01.837 --> 16:03.702
that finally he would just—

16:03.839 --> 16:06.376
You thought you could make him
proud of you by showing him
how tough you are.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.172
Pretty dumb, huh?

16:08.260 --> 16:10.171
I’m the one who got beat.

16:10.262 --> 16:13.595
That must’ve made him angry.
He doesn’t want you to have
to go through what he did.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.923
That’s why he made me
practice all the time.

16:16.017 --> 16:18.099
But l-l stunk at karate.

16:18.186 --> 16:21.599
So he took you with him
when he went to talk to
your karate teacher, right?

16:21.690 --> 16:23.726
He just wanted
to work things out.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.227
He flipped out, Mom.

16:25.318 --> 16:29.277
The sensei was
so much bigger than him,
and Dad just kept yelling.

16:29.364 --> 16:32.401
It was so embarrassing.
That’s why I called 911.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.028
I didn’t know
what else to do.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.527
| just wanted it
to stop.
Right.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.657
And when they came home,

16:38.748 --> 16:41.615
did your husband
talk to you at all about
what happened, Mrs. Cole?

16:42.460 --> 16:45.497
No, he didn’t.

16:45.589 --> 16:49.502
He was upset,
but he didn’t like to talk.

16:49.593 --> 16:53.051
Okay. What about you, Danny?
Did he talk to you at all?

16:53.138 --> 16:57.222
The next morning,
before my class trip,

16:57.309 --> 16:59.425
he-he said he wasn’t done yet...

17:01.271 --> 17:04.104
and that he’d keep
fighting for me.

17:13.909 --> 17:16.116
Hey. You wanted
to see me?

17:16.203 --> 17:19.115
Yes. l was hoping
you could help me
with something.

17:19.206 --> 17:21.697
Oh, God, no, no.
l-l can’t even
look at that.

17:21.791 --> 17:24.749
No, not this.
No,no,no,no,no.

17:24.836 --> 17:26.451
Oh! Wow.

17:26.546 --> 17:30.255
Looks like the victim
ate a lot of peanuts
the night he died.

17:30.342 --> 17:31.752
[ Sighs ]
Okay.

17:31.843 --> 17:35.677
Um, could we just
move this along, please?

17:35.764 --> 17:38.346
It’s about Hodgins.
He seems to be
dragging his feet.

17:38.433 --> 17:42.847
l was hoping that you could
help me get him to return
some of his equipment.

17:43.980 --> 17:46.357
Oh.

17:46.441 --> 17:50.275
So you want me to use
my position as his wife
to manipulate him?

17:50.362 --> 17:52.853
That’s an ugly way
of putting it.

17:52.948 --> 17:55.906
No, no. I mean,
that’s the way it works.

17:55.992 --> 17:58.574
l manipulate Hodgins
all the time.
[ Chuckles ]

17:58.662 --> 18:00.493
- Oh, great.
- Uh, no. No can do.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.367
See, there are only
so many manipulations
a wife has.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.164
I don’t wanna
waste one of mine...

18:05.252 --> 18:07.413
on something like
fiscal responsibilities
at the Jeffersonian.

18:07.504 --> 18:09.085
Oh, hey. Wait.

18:09.172 --> 18:12.585
Does this look
like a worm to you
or a sun-dried tomato?

18:12.676 --> 18:14.132
[ Scoffs ]
Beats me.

18:14.219 --> 18:18.007
But that sounds like
a job for one of
Hodgins’s new machines.

18:21.851 --> 18:24.228
[ Booth ]
Hey, buddy, you here?

18:24.312 --> 18:25.722
Just had a quick break.

18:25.814 --> 18:28.476
Wanted to see if you
wanted to grab a bite...
or something.

18:28.566 --> 18:29.772
Parker?

18:29.859 --> 18:31.724
Parker?
Great.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.817
[ Exhales ]
Dad?

18:33.905 --> 18:36.112
Yeah?
There you are.

18:36.199 --> 18:38.690
- Where were you?
- What are you doing home?

18:38.785 --> 18:40.992
I came by to see you,
obviously, of course.

18:41.079 --> 18:43.786
- And I was gonna
pick up my gym bag.
- I haven’t seen it.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.864
Of course
you haven’t seen my gym bag.

18:45.959 --> 18:48.826
Why would you...
have seen my bag?

18:48.920 --> 18:51.411
- Where were you just now?
- Uh, nowhere.

18:51.506 --> 18:54.464
- Just exploring the woods out back.
- Out back, exploring the woods.

18:54.551 --> 18:57.759
Okay, well, why didn’t you
tell the babysitter
where you were?

18:57.846 --> 19:00.007
’Cause I’m not a baby.
Christine’s the baby.

[Cell Phone Ringing]

19:02.559 --> 19:03.844
[Beeps]
Booth.

19:03.935 --> 19:07.223
| just had the pleasure
of emptying the victim’s stomach,

19:07.314 --> 19:10.181
and I found a very unusual,
very nasty-looking worm.

19:10.275 --> 19:11.856
I’m passing it on to Hodgins.

19:11.943 --> 19:13.808
Great. I’m sure he’s
gonna be real excited.

19:13.945 --> 19:17.062
Is there anything else,
or is this just all about worms?
[Brennan] Yes, a lot more.

19:17.157 --> 19:21.491
Cam found points
of compromised periosteum
on the skeleton...

19:21.578 --> 19:24.991
over the pelvis
and the lower extremities.

19:25.081 --> 19:27.072
- Bruising.
- All right, so he was beaten up.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.123
[ Saroyan ]
But/'1‘ wasn ’2‘
a one-sided fly/71‘.

19:29.210 --> 19:32.168
Bruising suggests
the victim actually
got a few punches in.

19:32.255 --> 19:33.540
Which couldn’t
have been easy.

19:33.631 --> 19:37.590
Each bruise matrix
has a highly localized
point of impact

19:37.677 --> 19:40.464
- He fought someone
proficient in martial arts.
- The karate teacher.

19:40.555 --> 19:44.389
I’ll come by, pick you up
and we can see if his hands
match the wounds and stuff.

19:44.476 --> 19:46.182
I’ll see you in 15.
[Beeps]

19:46.269 --> 19:48.851
Hey, buddy.
I need to get back
to work. Okay?

19:48.938 --> 19:51.896
Stay tight. I’ll see ya later.
If you go anywhere,
you tell the babysitter—

19:51.983 --> 19:55.601
Right. You tell the sitter
where you’re gonna be.
All right?

19:55.695 --> 19:56.935
Yeah.

he said he was out
playing in the woods,

20:22.680 --> 20:25.968
but his sneakers were clean
and there was nothing
in his treads.

his sneakers.

they got into a fight?
Yes.

as well as I should’ve.

a little threatening.

Rumor is that Tony
couldn’t let it drop.

22:02.864 --> 22:04.775
He came here last Thursday.
I never saw him again.

22:04.866 --> 22:08.484
Then you wouldn’t mind
if Dr. Brennan here takes a mold
of your hands and your feet...

to the injuries
from the victim.

How’s it goin’ with Parker?

23:02.298 --> 23:03.708
Booth is worried.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.711
Parker spends
a lot of time
in his room,

23:05.802 --> 23:07.918
and when he goes out
he lies about
where he’s been.

23:08.012 --> 23:10.128
Okay.
Well, I’d be worried too.

23:10.223 --> 23:13.010
But he looks at Christine
with such affection.

Adolescents in many tribes
are encouraged...

Okay.

was considerably smaller
than the karate guy.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.611
Could we maybe
be looking for a child?

23:34.706 --> 23:37.618
It’s possible,
if the child
was adept at karate.

23:37.709 --> 23:40.200
Maybe when Cole got nowhere
with the sensei,

23:40.295 --> 23:42.786

24:01.691 --> 24:03.602
The worm you found
in the victim’s stomach.

24:03.693 --> 24:05.354
It’s a Scyphophorus

known to discerning drunks
as the common mescal worm.

was drinking mescal.

hailed from Mexico’s
Jalisco region.

32:32.868 --> 32:37.737
More specifically,
the southwest face of
Cerro Negro, or Black Hill.

32:37.873 --> 32:39.829
Your worm-Spanish
is excellent.
8/.

32:39.917 --> 32:41.953
Es mu y bueno.

32:42.044 --> 32:44.706
Now, one of the finest
distilleries in all of Mexico.

32:44.797 --> 32:46.708
They harvest agave there,
right?

32:46.799 --> 32:48.881
Mague y del 80/,
or the Worm of the Sun.

32:48.968 --> 32:52.631
While an interesting fact,
you’ve got us in Mexico when
our victim was killed in DC.

32:52.721 --> 32:55.178
Oh, no problemo, seﬁorita.

32:55.266 --> 32:59.680
There are only three bars
in the area that are licensed
to sell Maguey del Sol...

32:59.770 --> 33:05.606
and one is right on
the victim’s Spark & Steel
sales route— Cantina Carreras.

33:05.693 --> 33:08.435
Pretty good, huh?

33:08.529 --> 33:12.488
Exactly how many of your
new toys did you manage
to use to come up with this?

33:12.575 --> 33:14.691
All of them.

33:18.539 --> 33:20.951
[ Sweets ]
I don’t understand why
you needed me to come along.

33:21.041 --> 33:24.408
There’s no profiling involved.
You’re just tracking down
potential witnesses, right?

33:24.503 --> 33:25.959
No, we’re goin’ to a bar.

33:26.046 --> 33:28.958
And since bartenders
are shrinks of the food
and beverage industry,

33:29.049 --> 33:30.960
I figure that
you can translate that.

33:31.051 --> 33:33.337
I’m not buying it.
You’ve got something
on your mind.

33:33.429 --> 33:34.714
No. No, I don’t.

33:34.805 --> 33:37.467
Come on!
You always do this.

33:37.558 --> 33:39.014
Do what?

33:39.101 --> 33:42.343
You make an excuse
to get me alone
so you can ask me something,

33:42.438 --> 33:45.305
and then you deny it
and then we have to do
this stupid dance.

33:45.399 --> 33:49.312
And I’m not gonna
do it anymore. Okay?
So just stop the car.

33:49.445 --> 33:51.686
What?
What part of “stop the car”
is confusing to you?

33:51.822 --> 33:53.528
What are you doin’?
You know what?

33:53.616 --> 33:56.904
If you don’t have a problem,
then you don’t
need me here tonight.

33:57.036 --> 34:00.324
So I’m goin’.
Ah, put your seat belt on,
will ya!

34:00.456 --> 34:02.412
We’re coming up
on a red light.
Close the door!

34:02.541 --> 34:04.452
[Warning Bell Chiming]
All right, all right, all right!
It’s Parker!

34:04.543 --> 34:06.283
It’s Parker, okay?

34:08.422 --> 34:10.128
That wasn’t so hard,
was it?

34:10.216 --> 34:13.174
You know, the attitude
is really not necessary.

34:13.260 --> 34:14.636
Okay?

34:14.720 --> 34:16.221
Ever since Parker got back,

34:16.305 --> 34:18.762
he’s been looking himself
up in his room.

34:18.849 --> 34:20.840
You think it’s because
of Christine?

34:20.935 --> 34:23.347
That’s normal, right?
I mean, everyone says so.

34:23.437 --> 34:26.975
Yeah, it is.
And since you know that,
what’s the problem?

34:27.066 --> 34:29.978
Well, he’s also
been stealing things.
And he’s been lying.

34:30.069 --> 34:32.936
And he also—
He smashed this toy
that he and I built.

34:33.072 --> 34:36.906
Now, who would do that?
Look, he’s a good kid.
I don’t think that’s in doubt.

34:36.992 --> 34:39.324
But Parker’s behavior
must make you angry.

34:39.411 --> 34:42.323
What did he say when you
talked to him about it?

34:43.332 --> 34:46.495
I haven’t yet.
You have to talk to him.

34:46.585 --> 34:50.077
I don’t want him to feel
like I’m ganging up
on him. That’s all.

34:50.172 --> 34:52.333
You’re not your father,
Agent Booth.

34:56.011 --> 34:59.503
I mean, it’s okay for you
to be angry at Parker.
You’re a good dad.

34:59.598 --> 35:02.055
You’ll figure it out.

35:02.142 --> 35:04.098
You know how to handle it.

35:04.186 --> 35:07.178
This’ll turn out
a lot better than you think.

35:08.065 --> 35:09.805
Okay?

35:09.900 --> 35:12.277
Next time, let’sjust
cut the dance, please.

35:12.361 --> 35:14.352
For the record,
I didn’t need this talk,
just so you know.

35:14.488 --> 35:17.400
I just wanted you
to feel useful.
Pull over.

35:17.533 --> 35:19.990
Pull over. Pull over.
Pull over.
No. We’re on a case.

35:20.119 --> 35:22.485
J,» [ Background: Mariachi ]
Excuse me. F.B.l.
Special Agent Booth.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.532
This here is Dr. Sweets,
my colleague.
Cops.

35:24.665 --> 35:27.577
How can I help you?
Well, we’re here
to ask you a few questions.

35:27.668 --> 35:29.909
Have you seen
this guy before?
That’s Tiny Cole.

35:30.004 --> 35:32.211
- What’d he do, kill someone?
- He was murdered.

35:32.298 --> 35:34.755
Oh, that’s rough.
Poor little guy.

35:34.842 --> 35:36.753
Well, you don’t
seem too surprised.
I’m not surprised.

35:36.844 --> 35:39.586
About a week ago, Cole came in.
Nothing was going right for him.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.762
I could tell he needed a little
something to make the world
look a little better.

35:41.890 --> 35:44.597
So I gave him
the best I got.
Right.

35:44.685 --> 35:47.267
- Maguey del 80!, right?
- Must’ve been into his
third drink when it started.

35:47.354 --> 35:49.561
Everyone in the place
was laughin’,
pointing at Tony.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.263
What were they
laughing at?

35:51.358 --> 35:53.144
A video of Tony getting beat up
by this little girl on their phone.

35:53.277 --> 35:56.644
A lot of them were his customers,
so he flipped,
started threatening everyone.

35:56.739 --> 35:58.104
But that just made ’em
laugh harder.

35:58.198 --> 36:00.109
Short guy teased
and bullied his whole life.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.987
That kind of humiliation,
he’d do anything
to make them stop laughing.

36:03.078 --> 36:05.785
Looks like he did something
that got him killed.

36:10.294 --> 36:14.287
Blake’s friend
posted the video on WeTube,
but she didn’t make it go viral.

36:14.381 --> 36:16.292
There was
minimal activity
at first.

36:16.383 --> 36:18.339
Just some kids
passing it around
the school.

36:18.427 --> 36:22.636
But then at 5:23 pm,
we have the first viewing
away from the school.

36:22.723 --> 36:25.681
Within five minutes
of that viewing,
the lights start to spread.

36:25.768 --> 36:27.383
And then we have
activity everywhere.

36:27.478 --> 36:30.845
Hey, that looks like
it could be the bar
where Cole was last seen alive.

36:30.939 --> 36:33.897
Yeah, that was caused
by our active inducer.

36:33.984 --> 36:36.726
And then it just spread
like wildfire.

36:36.820 --> 36:38.560
Can you get an ID.
of the inducer?

36:38.655 --> 36:41.237
Uh, I can only
pinpoint a location.

36:42.409 --> 36:44.240
Can we cross-reference
that point...

36:44.370 --> 36:46.736
with our suspects’
addresses?
Yeah.

36:48.957 --> 36:50.367
Hey, Karl Singler.

36:50.501 --> 36:53.413
Isn’t that—
That’s the guy that was trying
to steal Cole’s customers.

36:57.007 --> 37:00.465
Karl Singler spread it
to every one of Tony Cole’s
customers.

37:00.594 --> 37:02.004
Why?
Why?

37:02.096 --> 37:04.337
Because he wanted
to humiliate him,
make him feel like a loser.

37:04.431 --> 37:06.888
If he does that,
then Singler has a chance
to steal his customers.

37:06.975 --> 37:09.842
We still don’t have
any physical evidence
to tie him to the crime.

37:09.978 --> 37:11.889
We got nothing?
We have to determine
a weapon.

37:11.980 --> 37:16.019
It appears as if he was stabbed
from the front, but the knife
was removed from behind.

37:16.110 --> 37:18.146
That’s impossible, Bones.

37:18.237 --> 37:21.479
Hence our problem
providing you with
the evidence you need.

37:21.573 --> 37:22.824
Right.

37:23.534 --> 37:25.115
Are you upset, Booth?

37:26.453 --> 37:28.409
Yeah, it’s the Parker thing.

37:28.497 --> 37:30.203
You know, we have—
[ Clears Throat]

37:30.290 --> 37:32.702
We need to talk to him
together.

37:32.835 --> 37:34.996
We?
Yeah, we.

37:35.087 --> 37:37.078
Together.
You know, as a family.

37:37.172 --> 37:40.585
We need to attack this problem
head-on and talk to him.

37:40.676 --> 37:43.509
We have a problem.
We have to do this together.

37:43.595 --> 37:46.428
Fish sandwich for you.

37:46.515 --> 37:48.506
- Veggie burger for you.
- Thank you.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.136
Enjoy it.

37:50.269 --> 37:53.227
Fish sandwich.
And a veggie burger.
Yes, I know.

37:53.313 --> 37:55.178
The fish! It’s a fish
that killed him!

37:55.315 --> 37:58.227
You can’t stab someone
with a fish, Booth.
The weapon.

37:58.318 --> 38:00.775
It was a fishing blade on
one of those multi-tool knives.

38:00.863 --> 38:03.195
The front tip of it
curves back, right?

38:03.282 --> 38:05.489
He wasn’t stabbed in the front.
He was stabbed from behind.

38:05.576 --> 38:07.862
So the tip, it breaks off
when he pulls it out.

38:07.953 --> 38:10.285
That would also
explain the scraping
from front to back.

38:10.372 --> 38:13.705
And Karl Singler is—
is a fisherman.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.619
Hey, Karl.
How’s business?

38:19.715 --> 38:22.172
Again?
This is harassment.

38:22.301 --> 38:24.792
May | see the multi-tool
on your belt?
Yeah.

38:24.887 --> 38:26.627
Get yourself a warrant.

38:26.722 --> 38:28.553
That fast enough
for ya?
Right there.

38:29.558 --> 38:31.890
[ Chuckles ]
Hand it over.
Let’s go.

38:33.270 --> 38:35.761
Be careful with that.
I won it.

38:40.569 --> 38:43.356
That’s it.
That’s the curved blade.

38:43.447 --> 38:46.814
The tip is intact.
The blade looks new.

38:46.909 --> 38:48.524
Yeah, I replaced it last year.
You satisfied?

38:48.660 --> 38:49.991
Mm-mmm.
No.

38:50.078 --> 38:52.160
There’s blood
in the gears.
[ Booth ] Blood?

38:52.247 --> 38:55.614
You replaced the blade because
the tip broke off? Why didn’t
you just throw out the knife?

38:55.709 --> 38:59.668
Why? Because it’s his trophy.
Right? But now it’s evidence.

38:59.755 --> 39:01.370
[ Booth ]
Right?

39:06.762 --> 39:08.673
Okay, look,
it was self-defense.
All right?

39:08.764 --> 39:11.506
That little bastard
attacked me because
he couldn’t take a joke.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.841
So you stabbed him
in the back? Come on.

39:13.936 --> 39:17.474
That’s not self-defense.
That’s pickin’
on a little guy.

drinking?

39:38.710 --> 39:40.166
Yes, we are.
[Stammers]

39:40.295 --> 39:43.128
Have one.
It’s not allowed.
You know that.

39:43.215 --> 39:46.378
Dr. Hodgins
brewed an exceptional
artisanal tequila.

39:46.468 --> 39:49.551
Hey, the rotary evaporator
makes a brilliant still.

39:49.638 --> 39:52.550
And I don’t know
how he makes guacamole
in that centrifuge,

39:52.641 --> 39:54.552
but this is the best
I’ve ever had.

39:54.643 --> 39:57.225
You just— You gotta
slice the onions
with the laser first.

39:57.312 --> 39:59.724
Have the decency
to hide this
from your boss.

39:59.815 --> 40:02.648
I thought that
we should have our own
Founder’s Day party...

40:02.734 --> 40:05.111
without costing
the Jeffersonian
any more money.

40:05.195 --> 40:08.983
I suppose you’re not taking
into consideration how much
that evaporator costs.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.486
[ Chuckles ]
Just try one.

40:11.577 --> 40:14.284
You know, you’re off
the clock, Cam.
Just be bad.

40:14.371 --> 40:16.032
It’s worth it.
Take a whiff.

40:16.123 --> 40:20.036
Come on. I got the idea from
our little wormy friend there.
Just drink.

40:20.127 --> 40:23.915
One toast to our wormy friend.
He solved the case.

40:24.006 --> 40:26.338
Come on.

40:30.846 --> 40:33.087
Damn, that’s good.
Yes!

40:33.181 --> 40:36.844
I think it’s an excellent use
of the Jeffersonian’s
facility and equipment.

40:36.977 --> 40:40.890
Thank you.
Do I want to know where you
got the agave to make this?

40:40.981 --> 40:44.565

41:26.693 --> 41:28.809
There’s anthropological
necessity for you...

within the family structure.
