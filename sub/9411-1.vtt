I guess.

14:08.567 --> 14:11.067
Why would my dad put
real electricity on that fence?

Obviously, he didn't
want anyone to get in.

14:13.567 --> 14:15.067
I think I know why.

The Toxic Creep
was no special effect.

He was real.

He was real all right.

And strong.
Did you see his face?

Oh, gross.

I thought I heard footsteps.

- [ Marty ] What does he want?
- Now that's a stupid question.

14:57.633 --> 15:00.667
I'd say he wants us
for his afternoon snack.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.167
Maybe this isn't real.

15:02.167 --> 15:03.167
Maybe this is
one big practical joke.

15:03.733 --> 15:05.467
