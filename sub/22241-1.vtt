00:09.809 --> 00:14.115
So it sounds like you're
not sure about this anymore.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.185
Being a mother,

00:20.187 --> 00:22.457
being married...

00:23.892 --> 00:25.224
my job.

00:25.226 --> 00:27.963
I was talking about the vacation.

00:32.902 --> 00:35.702
Well, it just doesn't sound

00:35.704 --> 00:37.370
like it's gonna be a vacation.

00:37.372 --> 00:39.238
Dumping a whole new routine on Emma,

00:39.240 --> 00:40.607
it's gonna be hard for her.

00:40.609 --> 00:41.842
Or for you.

00:41.844 --> 00:44.446
I'm used to juggling a million things.

00:45.748 --> 00:48.451
What does Emma's doctor say about the trip?

00:49.885 --> 00:52.587
Dr. Gardner thinks it's gonna be great.

00:52.589 --> 00:54.288
- Hmm.
- But then I think about

00:54.291 --> 00:57.593
how hard I've worked to make this home

00:57.595 --> 00:59.762
a safe space for Emma
where she can get better,

00:59.764 --> 01:02.097
and... and I just worry that she's going

01:02.099 --> 01:03.599
somewhere I can't control.

01:03.601 --> 01:05.900
Okay, here's a thought.

01:05.903 --> 01:10.106
Maybe you can use this vacation as a chance

01:10.108 --> 01:15.044
to practice not being in control so much.

01:15.046 --> 01:19.783
You can see what it's like to
really focus on the present,

01:19.785 --> 01:23.557
what happens when you're
actually in the moment.

01:26.625 --> 01:30.728
Okay, how 'bout, like, Ten Places in
Your Child's Bedroom With the Most Germs"?

01:30.730 --> 01:32.131
Emms.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.132
Emma.

01:33.134 --> 01:34.599
Check out the view.

01:34.601 --> 01:36.635
Hey, Jan, can you hear me?

01:36.637 --> 01:37.936
Emma.

01:37.938 --> 01:39.370
What? Hello?

01:39.372 --> 01:41.239
- I lost you.
- Earth to Emma.

01:41.241 --> 01:42.741
Can you slow down a little bit?

01:42.743 --> 01:44.309
I'm not even going the speed limit.

01:44.311 --> 01:46.979
Why don't you get off
the phone for two seconds?

01:46.981 --> 01:48.948
Yeah, sorry. No, the
reception up here is nuts.

01:48.950 --> 01:50.383
Okay, how 'bout a post on...

01:50.385 --> 01:53.219
Hey, Emms, you got something on your cheek.

01:53.221 --> 01:56.023
I know. That's just... That's just
something that's happening, so...

01:56.025 --> 01:57.324
No!

01:57.326 --> 01:58.726
Get away from me.

01:58.728 --> 01:59.893
For God sakes, Karen.

01:59.895 --> 02:01.227
- Shit.
- I'm sorry.

02:01.229 --> 02:03.063
- No.
- Hey, Emma, it's okay.

02:03.065 --> 02:04.398
- It's okay. Mommy didn't mean it.
- No!

02:04.400 --> 02:06.334
- Mommy didn't mean it.
- Get away from me.

02:06.336 --> 02:08.038
I'm gonna have to call you back.

02:10.139 --> 02:11.138
Hey, Emma.

02:11.140 --> 02:13.075
Can you hear me, baby?

02:13.077 --> 02:14.809
Look out the window, kiddo.

02:14.811 --> 02:18.080
Daddy used to come sailing
here and come swimming here.

02:18.082 --> 02:19.749
Look at the water.

02:19.751 --> 02:21.887
I don't like the water.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.074

Did you check out the view?

04:59.789 --> 05:01.357
You were going a lot faster than...

05:01.359 --> 05:03.491
I'm surprised you had time.
You were on the phone so much.

05:03.493 --> 05:05.393
Yeah, I can be on the
phone and see the view.

05:05.395 --> 05:06.631
Yeah?

05:07.965 --> 05:09.266
Hey, Emms, baby.

05:09.268 --> 05:10.503
Hey...

05:11.270 --> 05:13.202
why don't we set up

05:13.204 --> 05:15.939
your coloring station
right here? Sit down, baby.

05:15.941 --> 05:18.842
Here's your favorite pad...

05:18.844 --> 05:23.082
and your coloring pencils. Yay.

05:26.219 --> 05:27.517
That's still creepy.

05:27.519 --> 05:29.855
You know, it still smells
in here, that smell.

05:29.857 --> 05:31.223
Yeah. It grows on you, right?

05:31.225 --> 05:32.290
What is that?

05:32.292 --> 05:33.492
I'm surprised you remember.

05:33.494 --> 05:35.460
It's been a lot of years since then.

05:35.462 --> 05:37.231
You were drunk most of the time.

05:38.064 --> 05:39.297
What's drunk?

05:39.299 --> 05:40.598
Oh, that's something your Mom and Dad

05:40.600 --> 05:41.967
used to do quite a bit,

05:41.969 --> 05:43.303
but now your mother tends to forget,

05:43.305 --> 05:45.204
bit like butterfly tattoos.

05:45.206 --> 05:47.005
What are butterfly tattoos?

05:47.007 --> 05:48.007
Never mind.

05:48.009 --> 05:49.274
Crap. I know what I forgot.

05:49.276 --> 05:50.276
Please say underwear.

05:50.278 --> 05:51.813
Chia.

05:52.613 --> 05:54.013
As in the pet?

05:54.015 --> 05:55.415
As in the seed.

05:55.417 --> 05:56.616
So you can grow a pet?

05:56.618 --> 05:58.352
No, for brain development.

05:58.354 --> 06:00.186
It's got omega-3 fatty acids.

06:00.188 --> 06:01.522
I put them in smoothies for Emma.

06:01.524 --> 06:04.157
- Dr. Gardner said...
- Oh, if Dr. Gardner said it,

06:04.159 --> 06:05.458
then it must be right.

06:27.652 --> 06:29.417
That's why we hired a nanny.

06:29.419 --> 06:31.187
No, that's why you hired a nanny.

06:31.189 --> 06:32.489
I only agreed, because I thought

06:32.491 --> 06:33.990
we needed another adult around here.

06:33.992 --> 06:35.727
So there'd be two of you, right?

06:36.961 --> 06:38.028
What is that?

06:38.030 --> 06:39.095
- What?
- Nothing.

06:39.097 --> 06:40.530
See? Okay, that's my point.

06:40.532 --> 06:42.032
Is that what you're talking about?

06:42.034 --> 06:43.133
That's my point.

06:43.135 --> 06:44.902
Hi!

06:44.904 --> 06:46.503
- Hi.
- Scott?

06:46.505 --> 06:48.472
- Gwen?
- Yeah.

06:48.474 --> 06:49.606
- You're Gwen?
- Yes. Hi.

06:49.608 --> 06:51.075
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Nice to meet...

06:51.077 --> 06:52.909
Hi. You're a bit early, right?

06:52.911 --> 06:54.045
- I know.
- Please come in.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.446
Let me take that. Looks real heavy.

06:55.448 --> 06:56.515
- Thanks.
- Oh, my God.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.682
What have you got in here?

06:57.684 --> 06:59.417
This is... I have... It's a month.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.886
This is a beautiful house.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.453
Yeah. It belongs to my folks.

07:02.455 --> 07:04.023
They usually rent it out,

07:04.025 --> 07:05.992
but they're letting us steal it for a bit.

07:05.994 --> 07:07.060
- Wow.
- Please, come...

07:07.062 --> 07:08.194
Karen.

07:08.196 --> 07:09.661
Oh. Hi. Karen.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.930
It's so nice to finally meet you. I'm Gwen.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.268
Nice to meet you, Gwen.

07:15.437 --> 07:17.370
I know we've only spoken over e-mail,

07:17.372 --> 07:20.073
but I feel like I know you guys already.

07:20.075 --> 07:21.674
I absolutely love your blog, Karen.

07:21.676 --> 07:23.477
I think what you're doing is amazing.

07:23.479 --> 07:25.111
- Oh, thanks.
- That's so nice.

07:25.113 --> 07:27.248
Um, I brought the paperwork.

07:27.250 --> 07:28.616
That's for you guys.

07:28.618 --> 07:31.286
I also brought a little something for Emma.

07:31.288 --> 07:32.721
Well, that's so sweet. Thank you.

07:32.723 --> 07:34.758
Yeah, sure. Of course.

07:37.093 --> 07:38.560
So can I meet her?

07:38.562 --> 07:39.995
- Sure.
- Well, no, actually,

07:39.997 --> 07:41.496
uh, we promised her that she could have

07:41.498 --> 07:43.099
some time drawing after the car ride.

07:43.101 --> 07:44.399
- Oh, we did.
- It was a long ride.

07:44.401 --> 07:45.500
I have a schedule.

07:45.502 --> 07:46.738
Oh, hello.

07:48.072 --> 07:49.638
Hello.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.306
Are you Emma?

07:51.308 --> 07:53.142
I'm Gwen.

07:53.144 --> 07:55.412
I've heard a lot about you, Emma,

07:55.414 --> 07:56.747
that you're very smart

07:56.749 --> 08:00.753
and enjoy reading and drawing.

08:02.220 --> 08:05.556
And, honey, you have a little
bit of crayon on your face.

08:05.558 --> 08:07.625
- Um, no, she...
- Actually, she really doesn't like...

08:07.627 --> 08:09.530
Would you like to get it?

08:17.370 --> 08:18.839
Good as new.

08:25.078 --> 08:28.114
Emma, you're so talented...

08:28.116 --> 08:30.216
and prolific.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.486
Which one's your favorite?

08:34.490 --> 08:36.188
Amazing.

08:36.191 --> 08:37.693
Is that your house?

08:39.227 --> 08:42.996
And those trees, those are beautiful trees.

08:42.999 --> 08:44.568
And who's that?

08:45.534 --> 08:46.533
That's me.

08:46.535 --> 08:48.537
All alone?

08:51.707 --> 08:53.642
Show me another one.

08:59.382 --> 09:00.951
Beautiful.

09:13.497 --> 09:15.333
Oh, yes.

09:21.106 --> 09:22.341
Nice.

09:24.442 --> 09:26.545
She's not what I expected.

09:28.281 --> 09:29.548
No.

09:30.551 --> 09:32.117
No, she's not what I expected either,

09:32.119 --> 09:33.484
but she's perfect.

09:33.486 --> 09:35.655
I've never seen Emma
take to anyone so quickly.

09:36.456 --> 09:37.656
She's a child.

09:37.658 --> 09:39.391
Yeah, but the agency sent us everything,

09:39.393 --> 09:41.694
you know, references,
degree in child psychology,

09:41.696 --> 09:44.196
and she has experience with
kids on the spectrum, so...

09:44.198 --> 09:46.566
Did they also send her modeling portfolio?

09:46.568 --> 09:48.600
They did, but I burnt those pictures.

09:48.602 --> 09:49.837
You know me.

09:51.206 --> 09:53.407
Come on, Karen. I was hiring a nanny,

09:53.409 --> 09:54.640
not ordering a Russian bride.

09:54.642 --> 09:55.877
Yes.

09:56.745 --> 09:58.544
Just try it for a couple of days.

09:58.546 --> 10:00.581
If you really don't like
her, we'll send her home.

10:00.583 --> 10:02.817
We'll just say it didn't work out.

10:03.549 --> 10:05.653
Besides, think about all
the free time you'll have.

10:07.257 --> 10:08.289
Free time?

10:08.291 --> 10:09.723
What do you do with free time?

10:09.725 --> 10:11.693
Well...

10:11.695 --> 10:13.595
getting into a hot tub like that

10:13.597 --> 10:15.829
is gonna take a certain amount of practice

10:15.831 --> 10:17.734
and commitment to practice.

10:18.702 --> 10:20.435
Hey, can you start dinner?

10:20.437 --> 10:22.304
Because Dr. Gardner said
that it'd be really great

10:22.306 --> 10:24.339
if I can get Emma down to the lake today.

10:24.341 --> 10:25.341
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:25.343 --> 10:26.574
She's gonna freak out.

10:26.576 --> 10:28.577
No, I'm gonna take things slow.

10:28.579 --> 10:31.180
Besides, what other option is
there if we're gonna stay here,

10:31.182 --> 10:32.781
lock her in her room?

10:32.783 --> 10:34.517
Yeah, let's not do that.

10:34.519 --> 10:37.088
That's how I plan to deal with her dating.

10:39.191 --> 10:40.425
Hey.

10:43.295 --> 10:44.530
Thanks.

11:07.888 --> 11:10.622
Do you wanna walk down
to the end of the dock?

11:10.624 --> 11:11.894
No.

11:12.926 --> 11:15.029
Okay. Well, we'll sit right here.

11:28.443 --> 11:31.114
Why are you so afraid of the water?

11:37.888 --> 11:39.590
Greetings, ladies.

11:42.659 --> 11:44.729
It's beautiful, isn't it?

11:47.597 --> 11:49.133
Beautiful as you.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.201
Um, you know, I think this is our dock.

11:52.203 --> 11:53.201
We're staying at the...

11:53.203 --> 11:54.303
Oh, the Morgan place.

11:54.305 --> 11:55.838
Yeah, I saw you pull up.

11:55.840 --> 11:56.972
And you?

11:56.974 --> 11:59.544
Oh, I'm just down the shore.

12:03.949 --> 12:06.119
And what's your name there, little one?

12:08.620 --> 12:10.621
- Emma.
- Emma.

12:10.623 --> 12:13.290
Pleased to meet you, Emma. I'm Harry.

12:13.292 --> 12:14.925
How do you like my lake?

12:14.927 --> 12:17.829
It's a good lake. It's calm and still,

12:17.831 --> 12:21.400
and it's filled with all kinds of stuff.

12:21.402 --> 12:22.667
Bad stuff.

12:22.669 --> 12:24.236
Ah, good stuff, too,

12:24.238 --> 12:27.705
like birds, fish,

12:27.707 --> 12:30.211
and wild animals just like you.

12:32.279 --> 12:34.617
And if you listen real close...

12:36.284 --> 12:37.953
you can hear things, too.

12:41.021 --> 12:42.523
Go ahead. Listen.

12:59.276 --> 13:01.012
There's a fish.

13:02.378 --> 13:03.879
He's talking to me.

13:03.881 --> 13:05.884
What's he saying?

13:07.051 --> 13:08.785
He wants to play.

13:08.787 --> 13:11.820
If you like fish, I have
an aquarium at my house.

13:11.822 --> 13:13.555
You can come and look at it if you want.

13:13.557 --> 13:15.059
Okay, we need to go.

13:15.960 --> 13:16.992
Come on, baby.

13:16.994 --> 13:18.263
Come on, darling.

13:19.697 --> 13:21.767
It was nice to meet you.

13:22.902 --> 13:24.136
Bye-bye, Emma.

13:26.337 --> 13:28.006
Keep listening.

13:43.524 --> 13:44.856
Come on.

13:46.461 --> 13:47.560
Yes. Yes.

13:47.562 --> 13:49.461
On your left, you son of a bitch.

13:49.463 --> 13:51.496
Yes.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.697
Wait.

13:52.699 --> 13:54.467
Wait. Wait!

13:56.571 --> 13:58.073
Crap.

15:33.610 --> 15:35.145
Fuck.

15:48.492 --> 15:51.192
Emma, you left one of your drawings out!

15:51.194 --> 15:52.927
- Emma... Shit!
- Scott!

15:52.929 --> 15:54.063
- I leave the door open?
- I'm so sorry.

15:54.065 --> 15:55.064
- I'm so sorry.
- How embarrassing.

15:55.066 --> 15:56.098
Where's Emma?

15:56.100 --> 15:57.800
Um, your wife put her to bed.

15:57.802 --> 15:59.001
- In our room?
- Yeah.

15:59.003 --> 16:00.502
Right. Okay. I'm so sorry.

16:00.504 --> 16:01.670
It's fine.

16:01.672 --> 16:03.106
Look, the lock is, uh...

16:03.108 --> 16:04.106
Um, yeah. Thanks.

16:04.108 --> 16:05.779
Bye.

16:07.013 --> 16:08.011
- Shh.
- Shit.

16:08.013 --> 16:09.512
What are you doing?

16:09.514 --> 16:11.549
Can you carry Emma from
our bed into her bed?

16:11.551 --> 16:12.750
- Yeah.
- My back is killing me.

16:12.752 --> 16:13.984
Gwen's just changing right now.

16:13.986 --> 16:15.151
- She is?
- Yeah.

16:15.153 --> 16:16.455
Doesn't matter.

16:17.825 --> 16:19.490
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:19.492 --> 16:21.727
Did your parents ever mention some, like,

16:21.729 --> 16:24.463
really creepy guy that lives down the lake?

16:24.465 --> 16:25.696
What?

16:25.698 --> 16:27.031
No, I don't think so.

16:27.033 --> 16:28.566
Why?

16:28.568 --> 16:30.702
'Cause this, like, really, really weird guy

16:30.704 --> 16:32.672
came up to us today.

16:32.674 --> 16:36.643
He asked Emma if she wanted
to visit his aquarium.

16:36.645 --> 16:37.909
It was really weird.

16:37.911 --> 16:39.177
- You're shitting me.
- No.

16:39.179 --> 16:40.613
That's so creepy.

16:40.615 --> 16:42.048
I'll ask my mom, okay?

16:42.050 --> 16:43.716
Okay.

16:43.718 --> 16:46.255
Wait. Were you... Are
you... Were you smoking?

16:47.656 --> 16:49.023
Yeah, I had a cigarette.

16:49.025 --> 16:50.890
- In the house?
- No, of course not.

16:50.892 --> 16:54.063
On the patio, but it
must have just come in...

17:13.017 --> 17:14.049
What the hell?

17:14.050 --> 17:15.286
Hey, Scott...

17:16.787 --> 17:18.323
did it rain last night?

17:21.260 --> 17:23.125
My God, what time is it?

17:23.127 --> 17:25.161
Now.

17:25.163 --> 17:26.696
It's coming in under the door.

17:26.699 --> 17:28.731
I don't know.

17:28.733 --> 17:30.236
Morning.

17:32.172 --> 17:34.639
Uh, is Emma out here?

17:34.641 --> 17:36.074
Isn't she with you?

17:36.076 --> 17:37.075
No.

17:37.077 --> 17:38.445
What?

17:39.713 --> 17:41.381
- Emma.
- Emma.

17:50.624 --> 17:51.859
Emms!

17:56.831 --> 17:58.066
Emms!

17:59.000 --> 18:00.266
Emma?

18:00.268 --> 18:02.071
Ah, great start.

18:03.938 --> 18:05.174
Emma.

18:06.641 --> 18:07.910
Emma.

18:09.312 --> 18:11.177
God, I can't believe this. This is her job,

18:11.179 --> 18:12.879
and she can't even keep track of Emma.

18:12.881 --> 18:14.647
Oh, give the girl a break.

18:14.649 --> 18:16.317
It's her first day. She's
exhausted from the dri...

18:16.319 --> 18:17.852
It's not her fault Emma's a sleepwalker.

18:17.854 --> 18:19.020
No, she's past sleepwalking.

18:19.022 --> 18:20.321
Well, she's obviously not past it.

18:20.323 --> 18:22.189
New room, new house gonna kick things up.

18:22.191 --> 18:23.759
Okay, fine. If she's
sleepwalking where is she?

18:23.761 --> 18:25.127
I don't know! Did you check the dryer?

18:25.129 --> 18:26.794
I checked every room.

18:26.796 --> 18:28.295
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna check outside.

18:28.297 --> 18:29.698
No point looking outside.

18:29.700 --> 18:30.933
She knows she's not allowed...

18:30.935 --> 18:32.170
Scott! Karen!

18:32.970 --> 18:34.306
What?

18:38.275 --> 18:39.274
Oh.

18:39.276 --> 18:41.245
You had me so worried.

18:41.247 --> 18:43.380
Too bright.

18:44.816 --> 18:47.052
Pancakes, anyone?

18:48.953 --> 18:51.688
Okay, breakfast is at 8:00,

18:51.690 --> 18:53.858
and then cleanup and prepare for the day.

18:53.860 --> 18:56.361
Uh, she has an hour of free play,

18:56.363 --> 18:58.630
and then I read her a story.

18:58.632 --> 19:00.364
Uh, you know, preferably something short.

19:00.366 --> 19:03.267
Yeah. She likes fairy tales. Right, Emms?

19:03.269 --> 19:05.237
And then after lunch,

19:05.239 --> 19:07.072
uh, I have this math book.

19:07.074 --> 19:09.174
It's hard to get her to do any of it.

19:09.176 --> 19:11.911
So she does one page,
and she gets a sticker.

19:11.913 --> 19:14.313
Three stickers, and she
gets a half-hour of TV.

19:14.315 --> 19:17.083
Okay. They actually
don't use these anymore.

19:17.085 --> 19:20.687
These days, maths is more
about logic and problem solving.

19:20.689 --> 19:22.922
They're even teaching
10-year-olds algebra.

19:22.924 --> 19:24.857
Huh. That book's
for 10-year-olds.

19:24.859 --> 19:28.295
It's okay. I brought some
stuff with me. We'll be fine.

19:28.297 --> 19:30.730
I'll take a look at it after lunch.

19:30.732 --> 19:31.999
Hmm.

19:32.001 --> 19:33.901
Okay, for physical activity,

19:33.903 --> 19:36.170
we have some sand toys and balls.

19:36.172 --> 19:38.772
Um, she's a great artist, but I don't...

19:38.774 --> 19:40.943
I don't want her drawing all... all day.

19:40.945 --> 19:42.677
Is swimming still out?

19:42.679 --> 19:44.346
Yeah. She really doesn't like water,

19:44.348 --> 19:46.181
so she can't even take a bath.

19:46.183 --> 19:48.016
We... We wash her hair in the sink.

19:48.018 --> 19:49.750
Okay. We'll work on that.

19:49.752 --> 19:51.686
All right, let's stop talking. Let's eat.

19:51.688 --> 19:52.754
Thanks.

19:52.756 --> 19:54.258
Can you move that for me, honey?

19:55.159 --> 19:57.026
- Thanks.
- There you go.

19:57.028 --> 19:59.061
- Wow.
- And Emma.

19:59.063 --> 20:01.097
Here's your one without the sauce.

20:01.099 --> 20:02.799
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

20:02.801 --> 20:04.267
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

20:04.269 --> 20:05.301
Oh, my God.

20:05.303 --> 20:07.404
Scott, this is delicious.

20:07.406 --> 20:08.405
Thank you.

20:08.407 --> 20:09.706
Are you a chef?

20:09.708 --> 20:11.075
No. I'm just in I.T.

20:11.077 --> 20:13.077
Yeah, but he was a chef...

20:13.079 --> 20:14.677
before.

20:14.679 --> 20:15.745
Before what?

20:15.747 --> 20:17.617
Before me.

20:25.425 --> 20:26.891
Oh, right.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.960
Oh, she had a baby?

20:29.964 --> 20:31.796
No, well...

20:31.798 --> 20:33.567
We haven't spoken in some...

20:34.869 --> 20:36.138
That's nice.

20:37.272 --> 20:39.772
No, we love it here, Mom. We love it,

20:39.774 --> 20:41.140
and just, uh...

20:41.142 --> 20:43.977
couldn't take that bird
off the wall, could I?

20:43.979 --> 20:46.648
No, it's just that Karen really hates it.

20:48.217 --> 20:50.385
No, I'm in the closet.

20:51.186 --> 20:52.719
You got my baby clothes?

20:52.721 --> 20:53.955
You kidding me?

20:53.957 --> 20:56.093
Well, what are you gonna do with 'em?

20:56.860 --> 20:58.258
No, I can't...

20:58.260 --> 21:00.193
Christmas plates, blankets,

21:00.195 --> 21:02.330
pillows. "So move some stuff."

21:02.332 --> 21:04.131
I'm moving some stuff. I...

21:04.133 --> 21:06.134
Oh!

21:06.136 --> 21:08.938
Oh, yes. No, I found it. Thanks, Mom.

21:08.940 --> 21:11.006
"Corinne has X cookies.

21:11.008 --> 21:15.044
Now Billy has nine fewer
cookies than Corrinne."

21:15.046 --> 21:17.247
So give me the expression that would show

21:17.249 --> 21:19.251
how many cookies Billy would have.

21:20.318 --> 21:22.152
Emma.

21:22.154 --> 21:23.656
Emma, are you listening?

21:24.956 --> 21:26.457
I don't care.

21:27.358 --> 21:29.259
Now, Emma, if you don't do this,

21:29.261 --> 21:30.528
you don't get a sticker.

21:30.530 --> 21:32.496
- Yes, I do.
- No, Emma.

21:32.498 --> 21:34.365
Yes, I do.

21:34.367 --> 21:37.201
No sticker, no TV. Those are the rules.

21:37.203 --> 21:39.172
I hate the rules.

21:41.442 --> 21:43.411
I hate the rules, too.

21:44.410 --> 21:46.944
Emma, I know you don't want to do this,

21:46.946 --> 21:50.182
but you've done things you
don't want to do before, right,

21:50.184 --> 21:52.384
'cause Mummy or Daddy asked you to?

21:52.386 --> 21:54.119
And even though you didn't want to,

21:54.121 --> 21:56.356
you still did it, and
you still got a sticker,

21:56.358 --> 21:59.227
so let's see if we can
try that this time, okay?

22:00.061 --> 22:01.394
Now...

22:01.396 --> 22:04.364
"Corinne has X cookies.

22:04.366 --> 22:07.301
Now Billy has nine fewer
cookies than Corrinne."

22:07.303 --> 22:09.503
So give me the expression
that would show...

22:09.505 --> 22:10.503
X minus 9.

22:10.505 --> 22:12.205
That's my girl.

22:12.207 --> 22:14.309
X minus 9.

22:36.968 --> 22:38.234
Hey, Karen.

22:38.236 --> 22:40.138
Check this out.

22:43.374 --> 22:44.541
Oh, my God.

22:44.543 --> 22:46.308
Oh, this one.

22:46.310 --> 22:48.111
Oh, my God. These must be 10 years old.

22:48.113 --> 22:49.979
They're all from 10 years ago.
I found them in the closet.

22:49.981 --> 22:51.348
I was on the phone with my mom and...

22:51.350 --> 22:52.349
And look... Wait. Look at you.

22:52.351 --> 22:53.484
- Look at you.
- Look at you.

22:53.486 --> 22:54.951
Hey, that's a nice one.

22:54.953 --> 22:56.386
Look at that. Oh, that's so nice.

22:56.388 --> 22:58.022
Oh.

22:58.024 --> 23:00.158
God, and this room hasn't
changed in 10 years.

23:00.160 --> 23:01.395
No.

23:05.633 --> 23:07.598
Do you remember this pool table?

23:07.600 --> 23:10.268
Your mother has not looked
at me the same way since.

23:10.270 --> 23:12.637
Well, she's not looked at
your face the same way since,

23:12.639 --> 23:15.340
but she's been checking out
your ass for the last 10 years.

23:15.342 --> 23:17.609
And it was a pretty good ass.

23:17.611 --> 23:18.644
- Wait. "It was"?
- It is...

23:18.646 --> 23:20.279
- "It was"?
- a pretty good ass.

23:20.281 --> 23:22.949
- What am I talking about?
- What are you talking about?

23:22.951 --> 23:24.951
- Here.
- Mmm.

23:24.953 --> 23:26.185
- Right?
- Oh, yes.

23:26.187 --> 23:27.789
Remind me.

23:30.259 --> 23:31.558
Ow!

23:33.128 --> 23:34.295
Shit.

23:34.297 --> 23:36.029
Think that happened last time, too.

23:36.031 --> 23:37.897
Yeah, but you look so cute.

23:37.899 --> 23:38.898
Cute i-in pain?

23:38.900 --> 23:40.334
- I look cute...
- A little bit.

23:40.336 --> 23:42.636
Hey, they're right upstairs.

23:42.638 --> 23:44.271
It's okay. They don't play pool.

23:45.309 --> 23:46.674
It's okay.

23:46.676 --> 23:49.010
I'll be quick, and you won't feel a thing.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.613
- What else is new?
- Thanks.

23:53.016 --> 23:54.785
Mommy, where are the stickers?!

23:55.954 --> 23:57.954
I'm coming.

23:57.956 --> 23:58.954
I have to go.

24:04.662 --> 24:06.330
Rain check.

24:06.332 --> 24:08.165
You know it never rains here, Karen.

24:08.167 --> 24:09.366
Did I miss my chance?

24:09.368 --> 24:10.934
You missed your chance. That's it.

24:10.936 --> 24:12.738
I missed it.

26:37.694 --> 26:40.563
And she wouldn't let me
in her room this morning.

26:40.565 --> 26:42.599
- She's a strange one.
- Hmm.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.200
She absolutely refuses my help.

26:45.202 --> 26:47.202
I can't say that I blame her.

26:47.204 --> 26:50.539
There's something about her
that completely baffles me.

26:50.541 --> 26:53.044
Now what's the matter with you?

26:56.715 --> 26:58.685
What's going on around here?

26:59.519 --> 27:01.552
What's the matter with you?

27:01.554 --> 27:03.621
That man's after me.

27:03.623 --> 27:05.757
You gotta stop him. He's after me again.

27:05.759 --> 27:08.596
- I'm gettin' out of here.
- I can't let you go!

27:12.766 --> 27:15.467
I don't wanna be left alone!

27:25.446 --> 27:26.681
No.

27:42.198 --> 27:43.764
Shall I just come in?

27:43.766 --> 27:45.367
I believe I'll have you

27:45.369 --> 27:47.268
deliver the dress, if you don't mind.

27:47.270 --> 27:50.107
I did say I'd take it.

28:07.892 --> 28:09.494
Emma?

28:11.897 --> 28:13.666
Emma, baby...

28:26.345 --> 28:28.447
Emma.

28:50.505 --> 28:52.909
No fever.

28:55.811 --> 28:58.278
And you're sure you don't hurt anywhere,

28:58.280 --> 29:00.015
like in your tummy?

29:01.317 --> 29:03.550
Emma, does your stomach hurt?

29:03.552 --> 29:05.455
No.

29:09.859 --> 29:12.894
Okay, well, you had a bit of a scare,

29:12.896 --> 29:15.630
but you're all right.

29:15.632 --> 29:18.366
And today, Emms, you...

29:18.368 --> 29:20.735
you can do whatever you want.

29:20.737 --> 29:22.738
Can I play with Gwen?

29:22.740 --> 29:24.973
Yes, of course.

29:24.975 --> 29:26.843
Can I have ice cream?

29:26.845 --> 29:28.712
Oh, I don't know.

29:28.714 --> 29:31.013
That's a fight you're gonna
have to have with your Mom.

29:31.015 --> 29:32.684
Can I go to the water?

29:33.586 --> 29:34.818
Yeah. Uh...

29:34.820 --> 29:36.054
No.

29:37.590 --> 29:39.690
She can't go outside until we figure out

29:39.692 --> 29:41.425
what happened last night.

29:41.427 --> 29:43.130
But Daddy just said I could.

29:46.466 --> 29:49.533
Emma, can you tell me
what you did last night?

29:49.535 --> 29:52.705
I woke up, and I went out there.

29:52.707 --> 29:54.439
I went to the window.

29:54.441 --> 29:56.610
Were you asleep?

29:57.644 --> 30:00.478
Why did you go to the window?

30:00.480 --> 30:02.983
I could hear my friend calling for me.

30:04.352 --> 30:05.685
He wants to play.

30:05.687 --> 30:07.922
What friend?

30:27.977 --> 30:29.614
Emma...

30:30.581 --> 30:32.784
The Fish Man.

30:36.819 --> 30:39.321
I'm gonna take her to Dr. Gardner.

30:39.323 --> 30:41.324
Are you serious? He's,
like, two hours away.

30:41.326 --> 30:43.392
No, no, if we leave now,
I'll be back before dinner.

30:43.394 --> 30:44.661
Stop it, Karen. Please, for God sakes,

30:44.663 --> 30:45.827
you can't go to Gardner...

30:45.829 --> 30:47.063
Were you even listening? Did you even...

30:47.065 --> 30:48.965
She has an imaginary friend, Karen,

30:48.967 --> 30:51.901
an imaginary friend.
It's not the first time.

30:51.903 --> 30:53.470
There was Susan the princess

30:53.472 --> 30:55.306
and... and Jamie the pirate and now...

30:55.308 --> 30:57.007
Something is wrong with her.

30:57.009 --> 30:59.442
No, there's nothing wrong with
her, Karen. She's autistic.

30:59.444 --> 31:01.812
She's autistic, and she has night terrors,

31:01.814 --> 31:04.883
and this is the package,
and it cannot be fixed,

31:04.885 --> 31:07.452
and every time you go to
Gardner, you make it worse.

31:07.454 --> 31:09.921
You didn't see the way she looked at me

31:09.923 --> 31:11.589
and the way she screamed.

31:11.591 --> 31:13.927
Well, you shouldn't have touched her face.

31:15.928 --> 31:18.931
Why can't you let her be okay?

31:18.933 --> 31:21.203
She wants to go to the water.

31:35.618 --> 31:37.117
Hurry up!

31:37.119 --> 31:38.688
Okay!

31:59.744 --> 32:01.577
Ohh! It's really cold.

32:03.948 --> 32:06.352
You like it out here, Emma?

32:50.565 --> 32:51.967
Hey, Scott.

32:52.902 --> 32:54.137
Scott!

32:54.936 --> 32:56.872
Hey.

32:57.673 --> 32:59.672
Hey, Gwen, please, next time,

32:59.674 --> 33:01.674
- don't forget the preserver.
- Oh, sure.

33:01.676 --> 33:02.809
Otherwise, Karen's gonna freak, okay?

33:02.811 --> 33:03.876
I'm so sorry.

33:03.878 --> 33:05.680
Hey, Emms, baby,

33:05.682 --> 33:07.182
Daddy's not touching you.

33:07.184 --> 33:09.986
Just put your hands through, okay?

33:12.489 --> 33:14.655
There's a good girl.

33:14.657 --> 33:15.656
Great.

33:15.658 --> 33:17.760
Scott.

33:20.732 --> 33:23.435
Hey, you wanna play?

33:24.735 --> 33:25.768
Sure.

33:25.770 --> 33:27.536
Um, you'll be okay, Emma?

33:27.538 --> 33:29.806
She'll be fine.

33:29.808 --> 33:31.077
Okay.

33:40.219 --> 33:41.953
Gotta throw this a distance...

33:41.955 --> 33:46.325
How... How did we do on the,
um, organic shampoo post?

33:47.192 --> 33:50.093
Wait. We got how many hits on that?

33:50.095 --> 33:51.763
Oh, wow.

33:51.765 --> 33:53.698
All right. Show me what you got, Scott.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.234
All right.

33:55.236 --> 33:57.005
Nice.

34:00.039 --> 34:01.072
Come on.

34:01.074 --> 34:03.207
Hey, pretty good.

34:03.209 --> 34:04.913
Hang on.

34:06.180 --> 34:07.179
Does that help?

34:10.819 --> 34:12.252
Oh.

34:12.254 --> 34:14.154
- Ow!
- You okay?

34:14.156 --> 34:16.657
Hey.

34:16.659 --> 34:18.891
No. I mean, we're having a blast.

34:18.893 --> 34:19.958
Yeah. It's fantastic.

34:19.960 --> 34:22.530
Um, listen.

34:22.532 --> 34:23.731
How 'bout...

34:23.733 --> 34:25.231
Wait. Jan?

34:25.233 --> 34:26.869
Hello?

34:46.324 --> 34:48.858
- Just a little...
- What do we have here?

34:48.860 --> 34:49.858
A bite?

34:49.860 --> 34:51.195
Yeah. It's fine.

34:57.034 --> 34:59.535
Hey there, pretty lady.

34:59.537 --> 35:01.306
Hello.

35:07.647 --> 35:09.883
You still listening to that fish?

35:11.250 --> 35:12.885
He's my friend.

35:14.119 --> 35:15.753
Fish make great friends.

35:15.755 --> 35:17.689
They really do.

35:17.691 --> 35:19.960
Okay, yeah, children's sleepwalking.

35:22.329 --> 35:24.298
I gotta call you back.

35:29.237 --> 35:31.938
You know, I have a bunch of fish

35:31.940 --> 35:36.576
in an aquarium back at my house.

35:36.578 --> 35:38.814
Want to come see it?

35:39.647 --> 35:40.883
Yes?

35:43.151 --> 35:44.453
Come on.

35:45.220 --> 35:47.220
Get away from her!

35:47.222 --> 35:48.289
Oh, hello.

35:48.291 --> 35:49.590
Don't touch her.

35:49.592 --> 35:50.858
We were just talking.

35:50.860 --> 35:52.194
I don't care what you were doing.

35:52.196 --> 35:53.761
I don't want you anywhere near my daughter.

35:53.763 --> 35:55.763
Hey, Karen. What's going on?

35:55.765 --> 35:57.699
I don't know... Where were you?

35:57.701 --> 35:59.937
We were right there. We've
been watching the whole time.

36:00.737 --> 36:01.904
Okay, baby, listen.

36:01.906 --> 36:03.605
You can't talk to strangers, okay?

36:03.607 --> 36:07.010
But he was taking me to the fish.

36:07.012 --> 36:08.278
All right, another time.

36:08.280 --> 36:09.278
I'm sorry.

36:09.280 --> 36:10.747
Emma...

36:10.749 --> 36:11.747
Don't touch her!

36:11.749 --> 36:13.782
Karen, for God sakes.

36:13.784 --> 36:16.053
- Hey, I'm really sorry.
- It's okay. Not a problem.

36:16.055 --> 36:17.289
I'm sorry, sir.

36:22.928 --> 36:24.861
Okay, back to the house. Come on.

36:24.863 --> 36:25.862
Fun's over. Now.

36:25.864 --> 36:27.297
- You okay, Emma?
- Now.

36:27.299 --> 36:28.934
What the hell was that?

36:28.936 --> 36:30.200
What?

36:30.202 --> 36:31.369
You, out there.

36:31.371 --> 36:33.737
You were acting like a crazy person.

36:33.739 --> 36:35.173
Oh, I was protecting my daughter.

36:35.175 --> 36:37.208
Oh, really? From who?

36:37.210 --> 36:38.376
From that guy.

36:38.378 --> 36:40.812
From that old, creepy hippie weirdo.

36:40.814 --> 36:42.848
Oh, I'm sorry. Was he looking at her again?

36:42.850 --> 36:43.915
Fuck you.

36:43.917 --> 36:45.350
Some random guy

36:45.352 --> 36:47.720
walks up to your daughter
in broad daylight,

36:47.722 --> 36:49.721
and you just... you
just let him talk to her?

36:49.723 --> 36:51.992
As you mentioned, he's not
some random fucking guy,

36:51.994 --> 36:53.226
'cause you met him before,

36:53.228 --> 36:55.094
and all he was doing was talking to her

36:55.096 --> 36:57.130
in broad fucking daylight, Karen.

36:57.132 --> 36:58.197
I can't... I can't beli...

36:58.199 --> 36:59.967
He wasn't doing anything.

36:59.969 --> 37:01.637
You weren't there!

37:06.709 --> 37:09.977
My Mummy and Daddy used
to fight all the time.

37:09.979 --> 37:13.080
You can cover your ears if you want.

37:13.082 --> 37:14.384
I'm okay.

37:17.321 --> 37:19.224
Rinse.

37:21.391 --> 37:23.125
You just have to remember

37:23.127 --> 37:26.462
that they're talking about
Mummy and Daddy stuff.

37:26.464 --> 37:28.897
They're not fighting about you.

37:28.899 --> 37:30.733
Yes, they are.

37:30.735 --> 37:32.801
They wish I was normal.

37:32.803 --> 37:34.336
No, no. That's not true.

37:34.338 --> 37:36.407
Who told you that?

37:37.209 --> 37:38.644
The Fish Man.

37:40.946 --> 37:42.414
Rinse.

37:52.059 --> 37:54.095
Oh, God.

38:10.444 --> 38:12.411
I'm sorry.

38:12.413 --> 38:14.513
I know you told me about him,

38:14.515 --> 38:16.652
and he just didn't seem that...

38:19.320 --> 38:22.691
Look, Karen, Emma's not a baby anymore.

38:23.858 --> 38:25.392
You know, she's independent and...

38:25.394 --> 38:27.193
She is 10.

38:27.195 --> 38:28.962
She's 10, but she's a smart kid,

38:28.964 --> 38:31.165
and she knows not to
walk off with strangers.

38:31.167 --> 38:33.468
We don't know what's going
on in her head half the time.

38:33.470 --> 38:36.407
- Karen...
- We need to go home.

38:38.174 --> 38:39.540
Why?

38:39.542 --> 38:41.409
- Just the water and the...
- Karen.

38:41.411 --> 38:43.344
the sleepwalking, and now this fucking guy.

38:43.346 --> 38:45.914
This fucking guy has
nothing to do with anything.

38:45.916 --> 38:47.817
You know, it's funny, 'cause Gwen said...

38:47.819 --> 38:50.220
Okay, I don't... I don't
want to hear about Gwen.

39:00.798 --> 39:04.670
You know, my parents are tired
of the upkeep of this place.

39:07.806 --> 39:09.974
They'd sell it to us.

39:09.976 --> 39:13.177
Shit, they'd give it to us in a heartbeat,

39:13.179 --> 39:14.581
and...

39:17.017 --> 39:19.383
schools are better.

39:19.385 --> 39:21.419
Cost of living is cheaper.

39:21.421 --> 39:23.421
I was looking at some property.

39:23.423 --> 39:25.890
There's a vacant lot down there.

39:25.892 --> 39:28.197
If we sell our place in the Valley...

39:29.130 --> 39:30.499
I...

39:38.373 --> 39:40.710
I hate my job, Karen.

39:42.410 --> 39:43.977
I hate it.

39:43.979 --> 39:46.348
I'm not saying I'm not good at it, but...

39:48.217 --> 39:50.185
And I love this place.

39:51.253 --> 39:54.791
I was thinking I could
open a restaurant and...

40:02.431 --> 40:04.901
Just we used to have so much fun.

40:04.903 --> 40:09.408
We used to be fun, and...

40:12.143 --> 40:15.815
I think this place is our chance for us.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.752
What are you talking about, Scott?

40:42.577 --> 40:44.209
"In the beginning,

40:44.211 --> 40:46.278
Beauty was frightened of the Beast,

40:46.280 --> 40:47.946
but soon she learned

40:47.948 --> 40:49.615
that despite the
creature's awful appearance,

40:49.617 --> 40:53.552
he was in fact a good and caring monster

40:53.554 --> 40:57.023
and would do anything
to protect her, so..."

40:57.025 --> 40:58.828
This story's dumb.

41:00.362 --> 41:02.862
Yeah, it doesn't make that much sense,

41:02.864 --> 41:04.631
but at least in this version,

41:04.633 --> 41:07.703
you don't have to worry about
someone breaking into song.

41:10.273 --> 41:11.906
Okay.

41:11.908 --> 41:13.310
You know what?

41:14.244 --> 41:16.447
Why don't you tell me a story?

41:17.647 --> 41:19.648
About what?

41:19.650 --> 41:21.552
I don't know. Uh...

41:22.620 --> 41:24.789
you could tell me about the Fish Man.

41:26.457 --> 41:28.457
The Fish Man is my friend.

41:28.459 --> 41:30.425
Is that right?

41:30.427 --> 41:31.796
And...

41:33.264 --> 41:36.365
what does he do, the... the Fish Man?

41:36.367 --> 41:39.670
He swims, and he lives in the lake,

41:39.672 --> 41:41.571
and he protects me.

41:41.573 --> 41:43.607
Oh, that's nice.

41:43.609 --> 41:46.378
That's real nice, huh?

41:47.379 --> 41:49.078
Why did he come here?

41:49.080 --> 41:51.783
He's always been here.

41:54.655 --> 41:57.790
Do you think he wants to
split the mortgage with Daddy?

42:00.427 --> 42:02.459
Okay, Emms,

42:02.461 --> 42:04.663
I think it's time for bed.

42:04.665 --> 42:07.268
But the Fish Man wants to play.

42:08.703 --> 42:11.703
Why does he want to play with you, Emms?

42:11.705 --> 42:13.474
Because he's lonely.

42:21.215 --> 42:22.551
Okay.

42:23.418 --> 42:25.085
Snuggle down.

42:25.087 --> 42:26.756
Come on.

42:31.227 --> 42:32.462
Good night, angel.

42:34.097 --> 42:35.766
Sweet dreams.

45:30.555 --> 45:32.124
Let's go home.

45:34.392 --> 45:36.161
Tomorrow, I'll take us home.

45:38.296 --> 45:39.832
Okay?

46:25.213 --> 46:27.617
Hey there, pretty lady.

46:41.632 --> 46:43.134
Mm.

46:45.335 --> 46:46.970
Oh.

46:51.843 --> 46:53.512
- Hey.
- Hey.

46:59.017 --> 47:01.019
You look so cute.

47:09.328 --> 47:10.661
I'm gonna make coffee.

47:10.663 --> 47:11.898
Okay.

47:13.332 --> 47:14.632
Oh, yes.

47:14.634 --> 47:15.898
Yes.

47:15.901 --> 47:17.769
No.

47:17.771 --> 47:20.037
No, where are you going?

47:25.746 --> 47:28.515
Emma, it's too early for TV.

47:31.819 --> 47:34.420
Could you tell me what
that big structure is

47:34.422 --> 47:35.754
back a few miles by the lake?

47:35.756 --> 47:37.957
Oh, you mean the old bathhouse.

47:37.959 --> 47:42.661
Heh. Yeah, that used to be a
pretty ritzy place in the old days.

47:42.664 --> 47:43.963
Then the lake went down,

47:43.965 --> 47:46.566
and they made a dance hall out of it.

47:46.568 --> 47:48.534
They put those buildings up out there

47:48.536 --> 47:51.740
and made some sort of a
carnival there for a while.

47:52.542 --> 47:53.777
Emma!

48:17.535 --> 48:18.600
Scott!

48:18.602 --> 48:20.470
When did you last see her?

48:20.472 --> 48:22.872
Um, Scott put her to bed around...

48:22.874 --> 48:23.872
9:00.

48:23.874 --> 48:25.375
9:00 or 10:00.

48:25.377 --> 48:26.442
Which is it?

48:26.444 --> 48:27.810
10:00.

48:27.813 --> 48:30.847
But then when I woke
up at 7:00 this morning,

48:30.849 --> 48:32.016
she was gone, and...

48:32.018 --> 48:34.018
yesterday she said

48:34.020 --> 48:37.688
that she wanted to go
into the water, but...

48:37.690 --> 48:39.390
but she doesn't even know how to swim.

48:39.392 --> 48:40.424
She doesn't like the water.

48:40.426 --> 48:42.426
Well, this is not as dire

48:42.428 --> 48:43.495
as you might think.

48:43.497 --> 48:44.796
We have a lot of cases where...

48:44.798 --> 48:46.098
T-There's a man.

48:46.100 --> 48:47.466
Okay?

48:47.468 --> 48:49.533
We met him a few days ago,

48:49.535 --> 48:50.836
and then yesterday he came by,

48:50.838 --> 48:52.038
and he... he wanted to talk to Emma.

48:52.040 --> 48:53.038
Okay, we shouldn't jump to...

48:53.040 --> 48:55.343
Listen to her, please.

48:58.379 --> 49:00.081
Okay.

49:01.382 --> 49:02.815
Okay, he said that he...

49:02.817 --> 49:04.616
he said that he lived down the lake,

49:04.619 --> 49:06.452
and then he wanted to talk to her

49:06.454 --> 49:07.954
- about the... the fish.
- And the water.

49:07.956 --> 49:09.923
Yeah, and he said that he wanted...

49:09.925 --> 49:11.825
he wanted to have her, like, listen.

49:11.827 --> 49:14.964
And he... And he asked
to take her to his house.

49:16.433 --> 49:17.766
All right, here are the facts.

49:17.768 --> 49:19.467
90%, she's gonna stroll back

49:19.469 --> 49:20.969
within the next three hours.

49:20.971 --> 49:22.469
She went for a walk,

49:22.471 --> 49:23.871
she lost track of time, and she's sorry.

49:23.873 --> 49:25.773
No, she's 10,

49:25.775 --> 49:29.476
and she's autistic.

49:29.479 --> 49:31.546
All right, well, 5%, she got lost.

49:31.548 --> 49:33.081
Maybe she twisted her ankle and she's

49:33.083 --> 49:34.983
holed up somewhere just
waiting to be found,

49:34.985 --> 49:36.452
so let's start looking for her.

49:36.454 --> 49:37.787
With that door being open,

49:37.789 --> 49:39.655
she's most likely on
this side of the house,

49:39.658 --> 49:42.091
so, Mick, you and Karen,
you know, go check the shore.

49:42.093 --> 49:44.460
Scott, through the front, check the woods.

49:44.462 --> 49:46.428
Gwen, you stay back. She comes back,

49:46.430 --> 49:49.199
she's gonna want to see a
friendly face. Look, at this point,

49:49.201 --> 49:50.801
there's really nothing to be worried about.

49:50.803 --> 49:52.972
W-What about the other 5%?

49:55.175 --> 49:58.145
Let's not talk about that 5% just yet.

50:00.146 --> 50:02.415
Emma!

50:03.883 --> 50:05.752
Emma!

50:07.821 --> 50:09.888
Emma!

50:09.890 --> 50:11.125
Emma!

50:13.727 --> 50:15.363
Emma!

50:19.034 --> 50:20.335
No, Harry.

50:22.503 --> 50:24.670
No, but he told them
that he lived in the area.

50:24.672 --> 50:27.072
Sex offender, parolee, criminal history,

50:27.075 --> 50:28.977
check 'em all.

50:36.084 --> 50:37.984
Was that locked?

50:37.986 --> 50:41.056
I... I didn't know it unlocked.

50:46.697 --> 50:49.366
Emma!

50:51.970 --> 50:53.635
Mrs. Morgan,

50:53.637 --> 50:56.207
does your daughter
normally come out this far?

50:57.041 --> 50:58.276
No.

50:59.244 --> 51:00.812
No.

51:05.583 --> 51:06.952
Emma.

51:12.857 --> 51:14.759
Emma!

51:17.930 --> 51:19.097
Did you meet Harry?

51:19.099 --> 51:21.633
You think he may have taken her?
