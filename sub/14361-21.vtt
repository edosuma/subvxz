<i>(Frankie) Human beings</i>
<i>have always had</i>

00:05.981 --> 00:07.224

00:07.357 --> 00:08.320

00:08.418 --> 00:10.533

00:10.697 --> 00:12.818

00:15.707 --> 00:17.548
Sue? Are you okay?

00:17.642 --> 00:19.316
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:19.655 --> 00:21.036
I guess.

00:21.167 --> 00:22.540
What's wrong?

00:22.742 --> 00:24.575
Mm, it's nothing.

00:24.665 --> 00:25.874
Okay.

00:26.081 --> 00:27.338
(Moans loudly)

00:27.435 --> 00:28.488
What?!

00:28.611 --> 00:31.285
It's just...
I was looking at Facebook,

00:31.380 --> 00:32.976
and all these pictures
are popping up

00:33.084 --> 00:35.759
of everyone
at Chloe Kirkwood's sleepover

00:35.894 --> 00:37.724
that I guess I wasn't
invited to.

00:37.841 --> 00:40.945
A-and everyone was checking in
and tagging each other.

00:41.061 --> 00:43.271
Well, I don't know what any
of that is, but is sounds bad.

00:43.379 --> 00:45.612
How good of friends are you
with this Chloe person anyway?

00:45.720 --> 00:46.697
I don't know.

00:46.804 --> 00:48.307
As much as Carly is!

00:48.431 --> 00:50.265
Oh, Carly was invited? Mm.

00:50.420 --> 00:52.080
Well, you didn't invite
Chloe to your party,

00:52.188 --> 00:54.331
so that's probably why
she didn't invite you to hers.

00:54.442 --> 00:55.812
Yeah. Don't let it
get to you.

00:55.943 --> 00:57.502
It's just how it goes
sometimes.

00:57.601 --> 00:59.064
Yeah, I guess.

00:59.888 --> 01:01.332
(Moans loudly)

01:01.946 --> 01:03.460
Hey, that was good advice.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.732
That was
"get up off the floor" advice.

01:05.884 --> 01:07.219
(Moans loudly)

01:07.306 --> 01:08.584
All right, well, if you're
gonna stay there,

01:08.697 --> 01:10.896
could you roll over?
I'm missing a sock.

01:16.860 --> 01:18.942
All right.
See you then, then.

01:19.551 --> 01:21.159
(Beeps) Okay, that was weird.

01:21.411 --> 01:22.888
That applies to so many
things in this house,

01:22.990 --> 01:24.716
you're gonna have to be
more specific.

01:25.372 --> 01:28.379
Your dad wants to have lunch
with me tomorrow at Stuckey's.

01:28.482 --> 01:30.750
- Okay, that <i>is</i> weird. Why?
- I don't know,

01:30.862 --> 01:33.191
but apparently I gotta drive
an hour and a half to find out.

01:33.320 --> 01:35.059
Wow. I hope
nothing's wrong.

01:35.161 --> 01:36.898
Do you think somebody's sick?
(Gasps) You know,

01:37.014 --> 01:39.774
he did have those things frozen
off his head a while back.

01:39.882 --> 01:41.616
See, this is why I never
pick up the phone.

01:41.725 --> 01:43.150
Nothing good comes of it.

01:45.808 --> 01:47.099
Shirts!

01:47.359 --> 01:49.367
Where are my shirts?!

01:49.843 --> 01:50.767
Grr!

01:51.439 --> 01:52.309
No.

01:55.010 --> 01:56.927
(Squeaking)

01:56.998 --> 01:58.308
Whoa.

01:59.246 --> 02:01.458
(Doors creak) You saw nothing!

02:01.720 --> 02:04.334
No, I saw, like, a million
bunnies in our closet.

02:04.465 --> 02:06.011
(Clicks tongue) For this
crisp dollar bill,

02:06.099 --> 02:07.775
might you be willing
to un-see them?

02:08.207 --> 02:09.223
(Pops lips)

02:10.101 --> 02:11.256
(Sighs)

02:11.575 --> 02:13.141
(Grabs bill) Spill it.
But make it brief.

02:13.245 --> 02:15.248
- I'm already losing interest.
- Fine.

02:15.374 --> 02:17.389
Do you remember Bugs,
the bunny mom and dad got me

02:17.504 --> 02:18.818
to make me stop whooping?

02:18.922 --> 02:20.788
- Uh-huh.
- Whoop!

02:20.910 --> 02:23.175
Well, mom and dad told me
not to ever let him out.

02:23.282 --> 02:25.317
And, of course, I did,
and then he made friends

02:25.424 --> 02:27.078
with this other bunny,
and then they gave each other

02:27.190 --> 02:29.626
piggyback rides, fast forward,
and here we are.

02:29.755 --> 02:32.065
Point of interest--
he is a she.

02:32.169 --> 02:34.182
Yeah. So, uh...
(Clears throat)

02:34.405 --> 02:35.880
so what's your plan here?

02:36.000 --> 02:37.567
I figured I'd wait till
they mature a little more

02:37.691 --> 02:39.124
and then release them
into the wild.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.624
You can't just throw
domesticated bunnies

02:40.729 --> 02:43.186
back into the wild, Brick.
They don't know what to do!

02:43.286 --> 02:44.812
They don't know how to climb
a tree to get an apple,

02:44.919 --> 02:47.062
and they can't outrun
a pack of angry cows.

02:47.168 --> 02:48.505
Come on, use your head!

02:48.737 --> 02:49.913
I will if you will.

02:50.007 --> 02:51.205
Okay, here's what you do.

02:51.363 --> 02:54.368
(Exhales) You get a box,
you put 'em all in there,

02:54.459 --> 02:55.732
you make a sign that says
"Free Bunnies,"

02:55.834 --> 02:57.394
and you take 'em to
the frugal hoosier parking lot.

02:57.519 --> 02:58.945
You stand there, you look cute,

02:59.053 --> 03:00.750
and you hope they look cuter,
and then, well,

03:00.878 --> 03:03.307
you start moving some bunnies.

03:03.737 --> 03:04.549
Hmm.

03:04.905 --> 03:06.473
(Groans) Look at this.
(Taps key)

03:06.563 --> 03:08.357
(Water running) Now they're
going to Chi Chi's.

03:08.518 --> 03:11.485
- Who? - The girls who didn't
invite Sue to their slumber party.

03:11.633 --> 03:13.749
(Gasps) Oh, and Carly's
there, too?

03:13.904 --> 03:14.968
Oh, great.

03:15.131 --> 03:16.295
What are you doin'?

03:16.443 --> 03:18.391
Snooping around
on her Facebook.

03:18.922 --> 03:22.223
What? An informed parent
is a responsible parent.

03:22.334 --> 03:23.995
I think we've proven we're neither.
(Sighs)

03:24.213 --> 03:27.028
Aren't you the one who says
to say out of the girl drama?

03:27.118 --> 03:29.126
Yeah, well, it's
a different world now, Mike.

03:29.238 --> 03:30.823
When we were kids,
if you didn't get invited

03:30.957 --> 03:32.810
to something, you didn't
find out about it.

03:32.919 --> 03:33.951
But now poor Sue is getting

03:34.064 --> 03:36.318
all these pictures
popping up in her face.

03:36.431 --> 03:39.308
Ugh. And then they all comment
on each other's pictures.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.900
Okay, you gotta hear
these ridiculous comments

03:41.996 --> 03:43.737
- that they write.
- I don't think I do.

03:43.870 --> 03:46.846
(Mocking voice)
"OMG, you are so <i>gorg!"</i>

03:47.039 --> 03:48.638
"Could you be more sexy?"

03:48.863 --> 03:50.915
"Save some pretty
for the rest of us."

03:51.026 --> 03:51.952
(Groans, normal voice)
And I gotta tell you,

03:52.060 --> 03:53.660
some of these pictures
are not that great.

03:53.739 --> 03:56.318
Who cares? Sue does plenty
of stuff with friends.

03:56.418 --> 03:58.128
Does she? 'Cause all
I see her posting

03:58.232 --> 03:59.918
is a picture of her foot.

04:00.017 --> 04:01.921
And no one's even liked it yet.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.419
She's not gonna get
invited anywhere

04:03.536 --> 04:05.350
if she's
the foot-posting girl.

04:05.459 --> 04:07.465
Frankie's she's growing up
too fast anyway.

04:07.590 --> 04:09.062
We should be thrilled
she's home with her family,

04:09.167 --> 04:10.821
taking pictures of her foot.

04:10.961 --> 04:11.869
I'd like to stay home tomorrow

04:11.966 --> 04:13.518
and take pictures of my foot.

04:13.603 --> 04:17.166
Instead, I gotta use it to drive
170 miles to see your dad.

04:17.278 --> 04:18.765
(Water running) Look, if you
do something nice for him,

04:18.921 --> 04:21.803
maybe I'll do something nice
for you.

04:22.306 --> 04:23.124
(Water stops) Really?

04:23.257 --> 04:25.686
(Sighs) - Not that.
(Whispers) - Yeah.

04:26.413 --> 04:28.221
You know, my friend
Stewart Merilander

04:28.328 --> 04:29.544
is in terrible shape.
(Sighs)

04:29.657 --> 04:32.046
He's got the diabetes,
and the wheel on his trash can

04:32.173 --> 04:34.437
falls off, so I had to
put it back on for him.

04:34.523 --> 04:35.979
Should've taken
a couple minutes.

04:36.113 --> 04:37.633
Takes me an hour.

04:37.735 --> 04:41.215
Yep. Some things take longer
than we ever think they will.

04:41.322 --> 04:43.160
But the thing is,
the next week,

04:43.303 --> 04:45.228
he brings me a tomato.

04:46.048 --> 04:48.075
See what I'm getting at
here, Mike?

04:49.084 --> 04:52.030
(Inhales) No, you know,
uh, I-I don't, Tag.

04:52.190 --> 04:54.350
We've been here
going on two hours now,

04:54.465 --> 04:55.786
and I'm still not really sure

04:55.892 --> 04:57.389
why you wanted
to have lunch with me.

04:57.489 --> 04:58.350
Is your health okay?

04:58.486 --> 05:00.438
Pissing like a teenager again.

05:00.540 --> 05:02.718
Uh-huh. So...

05:04.191 --> 05:05.424
So?

05:06.241 --> 05:09.381
So wh-what was it you wanted
to talk to me about?

05:09.473 --> 05:12.663
You ever read that book
"Tuesdays With Morrie"?

05:12.844 --> 05:14.397
No. Don't think I have.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.372
Every Tuesday,
this Morrie fella

05:16.494 --> 05:18.147
meets with
a former student of his,

05:18.291 --> 05:20.071
and he tells him
his life stories

05:20.188 --> 05:23.007
and his wisdom and so on
before he dies.

05:23.111 --> 05:23.903
Oh, God.

05:24.019 --> 05:25.362
So clear your schedule, Mike,

05:25.486 --> 05:27.881
'cause unlike Morrie,
I ain't dyin'.

05:28.364 --> 05:30.463
I've got loads of time.

05:33.736 --> 05:34.583
Look, mom,

05:34.691 --> 05:36.841
it's my Saturday Night sundae.

05:36.977 --> 05:38.453
See, it's a sundae,

05:38.584 --> 05:41.322
but I'm eating it
on a Saturday!

05:41.421 --> 05:42.830
Yeah, yeah. I get it.
(Laughs)

05:42.950 --> 05:44.057
Ooh! I know.

05:44.235 --> 05:45.865
I'll post it on Facebook.

05:46.012 --> 05:49.493
I'll call it my "Saturday Night
Suuue-nday," and I'll show it

05:49.603 --> 05:51.521
next to these funny socks
I'm wearing. (Laughs)

05:51.772 --> 05:53.260
Hey, what if we went
to a movie?

05:53.369 --> 05:55.945
Then you can post you went
to a movie on Saturday night.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.823
Oh, I like that.

05:57.917 --> 06:00.728
Oh, "going to the movies...

06:00.826 --> 06:02.352
(Singsongy)
with my <i>mom!"</i>

06:02.461 --> 06:03.851
Don't send! No.

06:04.192 --> 06:06.939
What about, "went to
the movies with the girls"?

06:07.044 --> 06:08.563
'Cause we're both girls, right?

06:08.771 --> 06:10.126
Love it.
(Typing)

06:10.700 --> 06:11.972
I'll get my jacket.

06:12.610 --> 06:14.321
(Door opens and closes)
Oh. We're really gonna go?

06:15.207 --> 06:16.362
(Sighs) I don't wanna
talk about it.

06:16.431 --> 06:18.553
What? (Gasps) Hold on.

06:18.645 --> 06:20.821
Is everything okay?
He's not sick, is he?

06:20.993 --> 06:22.274
(Closes refrigerator) Worse.

06:22.365 --> 06:24.244
He read "Tuesdays With
Morrie." (Cap fizzes)

06:24.375 --> 06:25.571
Oh. (Gasps)

06:25.675 --> 06:27.330
Ohh! (Laughs)

06:27.419 --> 06:28.531
It's not funny, Frankie.

06:28.620 --> 06:30.283
He wants me to
drive down there every week

06:30.405 --> 06:31.656
to hear his stories.

06:31.736 --> 06:33.146
- Every week!
- Aw!

06:33.278 --> 06:35.180
I think it's sweet
he wants to share with you.

06:35.279 --> 06:36.652
Do ya? Do ya, Frankie?

06:36.764 --> 06:39.178
Then maybe <i>you</i> should go,
'cause my life is wrecked now.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.061
Look, if you're so miserable,
just tell him

06:41.166 --> 06:43.380
- you don't want to do it.
- I can't do that.

06:43.502 --> 06:44.546
You can do that
with your own family,

06:44.660 --> 06:46.342
not the one you married into.

06:46.666 --> 06:48.823
You got off easy.
My dad's a hoarder

06:48.937 --> 06:51.189
who never wants to leave
the house or talk to anybody.

06:51.299 --> 06:54.019
And I am thankful for that
every single day. (Crunches)

07:02.994 --> 07:05.710
Well, that was a bust.
Didn't move a single bunny.

07:05.805 --> 07:07.479
And somehow, when my back
was turned,

07:07.577 --> 07:09.462
I ended up with these.
(Kittens mewling)

07:09.552 --> 07:12.223
What? How did this happen?
God! I gave you one job.

07:12.339 --> 07:13.579
The only person who wanted
the bunnies

07:13.682 --> 07:15.622
was a man who worked
at the frugal hoosier.

07:15.753 --> 07:17.253
On a related note,
I do not think

07:17.359 --> 07:18.981
mom should buy chicken
there anymore.

07:19.081 --> 07:21.466
Great. Now we got bunnies
<i>and</i> kittens.

07:21.562 --> 07:23.291
(Groans and sighs)

07:23.396 --> 07:25.032
Well, there's only
one thing to do.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.509
We gotta make 'em famous.

07:27.088 --> 07:27.944
(Mewls)

07:28.486 --> 07:31.118
<i>(Spy movie music playing)</i>

07:42.080 --> 07:43.952
(Female British accent)
Mm. Oh, Mr. Bond,

07:44.081 --> 07:46.713
you're <i>so sexy!</i>

07:46.817 --> 07:47.633
(British accent) Funny.

07:47.744 --> 07:49.103
I was about to say the same.

07:49.613 --> 07:50.452
(Mewls)

07:50.761 --> 07:53.742
Oh, my! You are charming.

07:53.857 --> 07:57.399
So tell me.
What brings you to Bangkok?

07:57.593 --> 07:58.934
Business?

07:59.066 --> 08:00.363
Or pleasure?

08:00.507 --> 08:02.520
Mmm. You tell me.
(Giggles)

08:02.845 --> 08:06.262
Because pleasure
<i>is</i> my business.

- Mmm, what's over here? Ooh. Ahh--
(Groans) - Oh--

08:10.333 --> 08:12.736
(Normal voice) Cut! Cut!
Gah! (Music stops)

08:12.862 --> 08:15.519
Brick, I told you, keep her top on.
(Beeps)

08:15.622 --> 08:16.869
We can't have another nip slip.

08:16.970 --> 08:18.135
We're gonna lose
our "G" rating.

08:18.255 --> 08:19.770
(Normal voice) I'm not sure
Sue's old doll clothes

08:19.875 --> 08:21.384
are really meant for bunnies.

08:21.527 --> 08:23.970
And I'm also not sure
why we're even doing this.

08:24.070 --> 08:25.647
Have you been living
under a rock?

08:25.808 --> 08:27.053
Once these guys go viral,

08:27.155 --> 08:28.963
we're gonna be
fighting off the offers.

08:29.057 --> 08:30.505
Think about it.
If you had the chance

08:30.614 --> 08:32.865
to own the sneezing panda,
wouldn't you?

08:33.006 --> 08:34.102
The skateboarding dog?

08:34.214 --> 08:35.989
The monkey that smells
his own poo and faints?

08:36.082 --> 08:38.504
This is not just sound business.
This is genius.

08:38.583 --> 08:41.534
And, now that I think about it,
a possible career path.

08:41.707 --> 08:44.135
<i>While Axl had a lifetime</i>
<i>to figure that out,</i>

08:44.234 --> 08:46.520
<i>Mike was stuck spending</i>
<i>what felt like a lifetime</i>

08:46.615 --> 08:47.748
<i>listening to my dad.</i>

08:47.858 --> 08:48.590
I'm telling you, Mike,

08:48.707 --> 08:51.020
there's no such thing
as a bad baked potato.

08:51.112 --> 08:53.945
Any man that tells you
different is a jackass.

08:54.283 --> 08:57.663
Don Rickles is a funny man.
That's all there is to it.

08:57.772 --> 09:01.068
Two words--
glucosamine chondroitin.

09:01.156 --> 09:03.652
Once a month, whether you
feel like it or not,

09:03.775 --> 09:05.619
just to know
it's still workin'.

09:05.812 --> 09:08.789
Mexicans-- sweetest people
you'll ever meet.

09:08.911 --> 09:11.295
Always release a test fart
if you can.

09:11.462 --> 09:15.449
Real, real, fake, real, fake...

09:15.531 --> 09:18.727
And that's why I can never
return to the Panama Canal.

09:19.636 --> 09:20.978
Oh, hey, Mike, I know this is

09:21.100 --> 09:23.194
a lot for you to absorb.
(Laughs)

09:23.528 --> 09:25.267
You know, Tag, it really is.

09:25.380 --> 09:27.701
Yeah, well, that's why
I-I brought you this book.

09:27.892 --> 09:29.329
(Thud) Oh, and by the way,

09:29.423 --> 09:32.002
can we move, uh, next week
up to 11:30?

09:32.113 --> 09:33.905
I don't want us to feel rushed.

09:36.157 --> 09:37.610
You crying, Mike?

09:37.860 --> 09:39.004
Little bit.

09:39.640 --> 09:42.197
<i>(Spy movie music playing)</i> (British accent)
Uhh. Tell me your plan, Dr. Bad.

09:42.315 --> 09:43.856
(European accent)
Well, Mr. Bond,

09:44.004 --> 09:46.921
my plan is to tie you
to a spaceship

09:47.031 --> 09:49.050
that's carrying a nuclear bomb

09:49.169 --> 09:52.462
that will drop to Earth
and extinguish you

09:52.627 --> 09:54.929
and all of humanity!

09:55.040 --> 09:56.836
(Laughs evilly)

09:57.300 --> 09:59.729
Oh, but there's only
one problem with that plan,

09:59.822 --> 10:00.934
Dr. Bad.

10:01.069 --> 10:02.951
And what would <i>that</i> be?

10:03.060 --> 10:04.635
Me!
(Gasps)

10:04.787 --> 10:06.123
- Ha!
- Ahh! (Gasps)

10:06.235 --> 10:07.486
Ha ha ha ha!
(Car whirs)

10:07.605 --> 10:10.764
(Hums spy movie music)
Seize him, Mr. Hoppity!

10:11.234 --> 10:12.569
<i>(Music crescendos)</i>

10:12.689 --> 10:14.090
(Car whirs) (Meows)

10:15.700 --> 10:16.781
Hi, Mrs. Heck.

10:16.902 --> 10:18.692
Oh, hello, <i>Carly.</i>

10:18.802 --> 10:20.037
Is Sue here?

10:20.727 --> 10:23.907
Sue, it's your friend <i>Carly.</i>

10:24.542 --> 10:26.487
So, Carly, what you been up to?

10:26.991 --> 10:28.796
Um... nothing much.

10:28.899 --> 10:30.570
Nothing? Huh.
'Cause I thought maybe

10:30.680 --> 10:32.886
you were hanging out
at Chi Chi's?

10:33.005 --> 10:35.245
Oh, yeah, well,
some of us went there last week.

10:35.349 --> 10:37.185
- It was fun.
- Was it "so much fun"

10:37.305 --> 10:39.839
with three exclamation points
and four smiley faces?

10:39.957 --> 10:41.866
Uh... (Laughs nervously)
I guess.

10:41.966 --> 10:43.767
Oh, here's Sue.
Remember her?

10:43.897 --> 10:46.080
Hey, Carly! You ready to go
to the libes?

10:46.177 --> 10:48.460
That is what some of
the seniors call the library.

10:48.564 --> 10:50.114
"The libes." (Laughs)
(Laughs)

10:50.190 --> 10:52.480
Did you hear that, Carly?
She learned it from the seniors,

10:52.584 --> 10:53.925
so, uh, yeah.

10:55.227 --> 10:57.250
(Sighs) So I didn't
read the book,

10:57.345 --> 10:59.814
but I assume the guy
ends up shooting Morrie?

11:00.957 --> 11:02.480
Oh, hang on. Here's
something interesting.

11:02.587 --> 11:03.900
Yeah, he was never
in the circus, Mike.

11:04.003 --> 11:06.247
He took one clown class
during the war.

11:06.337 --> 11:08.981
No. After this whole section
about foot maintenance,

11:09.126 --> 11:12.581
your dad writes, "always
look a man in the eye

11:12.708 --> 11:14.691
and tell him the truth."

11:14.818 --> 11:17.370
- He feels very strongly about it.
- Hmm.

11:17.858 --> 11:18.800
This is it, Frankie.

11:18.966 --> 11:20.800
I'm gonna use his words
to break out of here.

11:21.095 --> 11:24.176
It's like "Shawshank." I found my way to the sewer!
(Knock on door, door opens)

11:24.261 --> 11:25.589
Hey, mom, guess what.

11:25.677 --> 11:26.866
I was just checking on
the response

11:26.973 --> 11:29.006
to my status update,
and I have this new friend

11:29.126 --> 11:31.177
on Facebook, some girl
named Jill Munroe.

11:31.322 --> 11:34.344
- Wow. Really? That's great.
- I know, right?

11:34.476 --> 11:36.503
And underneath where I said
"we went to the movies,"

11:36.663 --> 11:39.753
she commented, "OMG.
Sounds super fun.

11:39.893 --> 11:43.218
Could you be more <i>gorg</i>
in your profile pic?"

11:43.325 --> 11:44.653
Sweet, huh?

11:44.775 --> 11:45.896
Anyway, I'll let you guys
sleep,

11:45.998 --> 11:47.427
but I just wanted
to share the latest.

11:47.524 --> 11:49.262
Night!
(Door closes)

11:50.420 --> 11:53.310
What? I... (Sighs)
Fine.

11:53.395 --> 11:55.236
So maybe I made up
a fake name and friended her.

11:55.335 --> 11:56.960
So what?! It's not illegal.

11:57.100 --> 11:58.482
Jill Munroe?
(Sighs)

11:58.564 --> 12:00.412
Farrah Fawcett's character
from "Charlie's Angels"?

12:00.526 --> 12:02.270
Oh, so you can't remember
our anniversary,

12:02.364 --> 12:03.753
but you got that locked in.

12:03.849 --> 12:04.926
Enough with this, Frankie.

12:05.018 --> 12:06.569
You're prowling around
Facebook every night,

12:06.675 --> 12:08.585
you're making up pretend friends.
(Sighs)

12:08.669 --> 12:09.927
You're getting obsessed.

12:10.152 --> 12:12.316
This is not about me, okay?

12:12.426 --> 12:13.836
I'm worried about Sue.

12:13.925 --> 12:16.418
There's this whole cyber fun
party going on out there,

12:16.530 --> 12:18.497
and I don't want her
falling through the cracks.

12:18.593 --> 12:20.449
What are you talking about?
She just went out with Carly.

12:20.602 --> 12:21.854
Yeah, to the library.

12:21.948 --> 12:23.530
Sue's fine to go to
the library with,

12:23.638 --> 12:25.950
but if you want a hot pretzel,
Chloe's your gal.

12:26.070 --> 12:29.009
Listen to me.
Nobody on the computer

12:29.111 --> 12:31.392
is having as good a time
as you think they are.

12:31.530 --> 12:33.644
Trust me on this one, <i>Jill.</i>

12:33.782 --> 12:34.861
(Sighs)

12:34.948 --> 12:36.787
I know, I know.

12:36.999 --> 12:39.324
Maybe I am getting
a little nuts.

12:40.192 --> 12:42.821
(Birds chirping)
We should have a sleepover!

12:43.349 --> 12:44.954
Hmm? Really?

12:45.056 --> 12:47.504
Hmm. Wow! Ye-- okay.

12:47.610 --> 12:50.390
I guess I could invite
the wrestlerettes and Carly.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.684
Hmm. Well, inviting
Carly is good,

12:52.811 --> 12:54.933
but you do see
the wrestlerettes a lot.

12:55.064 --> 12:57.416
What about that mentee you had?
The cheerleader?

12:57.510 --> 12:59.361
- She was cute.
- Oh, Jenna?

12:59.485 --> 13:01.857
Yeah. And there's that girl
that hangs out with Carly

13:01.968 --> 13:03.090
at the pretzel place.

13:03.201 --> 13:05.702
You know,
blonde, wears a beret,

13:05.840 --> 13:08.105
dates a guy named Steve,
loves the movie "Mean Girls"?

13:08.220 --> 13:09.560
Oh, that's Chloe.

13:09.739 --> 13:11.580
How do you know that stuff?

13:11.694 --> 13:14.469
Um, I think you told me once.

13:14.659 --> 13:16.378
- Oh.
- So...

13:16.487 --> 13:18.539
But, yay, sleepover!
(Chuckles)

13:19.046 --> 13:21.263
So that's why you
cut pickles in half.

13:21.378 --> 13:22.987
Got it. So listen, Tag--

13:23.102 --> 13:24.804
Now, women's lib--

13:24.908 --> 13:26.644
Tag, wait. Just-- just...

13:26.850 --> 13:28.213
hold up.

13:28.422 --> 13:30.691
There's one story in your book

13:30.826 --> 13:33.044
that really stayed with me.

13:33.144 --> 13:35.636
You mean the one about
the bathroom stall in Wichita?

13:35.790 --> 13:36.980
No.

13:37.073 --> 13:39.895
No, the one where you had
to fire your friend,

13:39.990 --> 13:41.524
but you said the best way
to do it was just

13:41.636 --> 13:44.048
look him in the eye
and tell him the truth.

13:44.158 --> 13:46.975
To be fair, the same thing
applies to the stall in Wichita.

13:47.096 --> 13:48.319
So I'm just gonna do it, Tag.

13:48.408 --> 13:49.582
I'm looking you
right in the eye

13:49.713 --> 13:50.855
and I'm just gonna say it.

13:51.044 --> 13:53.281
I can't do this anymore.

13:53.437 --> 13:56.704
I can't do any more
"Sundays with Tag" at Stuckey's.

13:56.824 --> 13:58.645
You ruined Stuckey's
for me, Tag.

13:58.791 --> 13:59.845
You ruined Stuckey's.

13:59.967 --> 14:01.622
You-- you ruined lunch,
you ruined driving,

14:01.744 --> 14:03.291
you ruined coffee,
you ruined listening,

14:03.396 --> 14:04.218
you ruined talking.

14:04.331 --> 14:05.810
It's killing me.
You're killing me.

14:06.353 --> 14:07.406
(Breathes deeply)

14:08.534 --> 14:10.271
Wow.

14:11.566 --> 14:13.988
Well, you're really
getting it now, Mike.

14:14.104 --> 14:16.716
That's exactly what
I'm trying to teach you.

14:16.980 --> 14:18.523
Now on to the boudoir...

14:18.650 --> 14:20.740
if Frankie is anything
like her mother,

14:20.859 --> 14:21.762
the bedroom...

14:28.166 --> 14:29.815
(Doorbell rings) Hi!

14:29.917 --> 14:33.147
Hi! Come on in, Jenna,
Chloe, Ally.

14:33.237 --> 14:34.970
I feel like I already
know you guys. (Chuckles)

14:35.295 --> 14:36.150
Carly.

14:36.272 --> 14:37.812
(Laughing) Hey!

14:38.006 --> 14:41.368
We are gonna have so much fun!
Okay, first--

14:41.478 --> 14:43.363
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Plenty of time for fun.

14:43.474 --> 14:45.561
But first, what do you say
we get everyone together

14:45.658 --> 14:46.888
for a photo op?

14:46.991 --> 14:49.540
Mom, they haven't even taken
their coats off yet. (Laughs)

14:49.633 --> 14:52.236
Oh, okay, coats off, and then let's get to that picture.
(Indistinct conversations)

14:52.328 --> 14:53.764
Wait, Sue, I've never been
to your house.

14:53.853 --> 14:56.615
- Can I see your room?
- Oh, yes! Aah! Come on!

14:57.197 --> 14:58.950
(Girls speaking excitedly
and giggling)

14:59.048 --> 15:00.456
(Frankie giggles nervously)

15:00.850 --> 15:02.795
(Chuckles) Don't forget
to "check in."

15:02.879 --> 15:04.392
"Check in"
to the Heck household.

15:04.513 --> 15:05.937
Be sure to do that.

15:06.337 --> 15:07.307
(Girls giggling) Okay.

15:08.885 --> 15:09.878
(Water running)

15:09.979 --> 15:11.803
(Gasps, female British accent)
Oh. Mr. Bond.

15:11.957 --> 15:13.502
What are you doing here?

15:13.613 --> 15:15.049
(British accent)
I narrowly escaped, darling.

15:15.150 --> 15:17.143
And I rushed right over here
to help you...

15:17.250 --> 15:18.713
(Squeaking) wash your back.

15:18.824 --> 15:20.173
(Gasps) Ooh.

15:20.434 --> 15:21.853
(Chittering) Ooh.

15:21.966 --> 15:23.624
Ohh. But why stop there?

15:23.710 --> 15:25.378
Oh, cut! (Blows air)

15:25.967 --> 15:27.783
(Normal voice) What's wrong?

15:27.941 --> 15:29.028
(Normal voice)
This kitten's a lox.

15:29.125 --> 15:30.415
I'm getting nothing from him.

15:30.510 --> 15:32.553
How's he supposed to seduce a
rabbit with this look? (Meows)

15:32.718 --> 15:35.311
I don't think a cat is supposed
to seduce a rabbit at all.

15:35.410 --> 15:36.781
Well, he's supposed to be
smoldering at her,

15:36.876 --> 15:38.460
but instead he's just like...
(Deep voice) "Oh, I'm a cat."

15:38.560 --> 15:40.016
(Normal voice) I mean,
there's no heat between them.

15:40.111 --> 15:41.385
I don't know what that means.

15:41.513 --> 15:43.746
"Smoldering"? (Scoffs)
Come on, it's like...

15:43.919 --> 15:45.778
How you get girls, you know?

15:45.869 --> 15:47.047
The look.

15:48.318 --> 15:49.881
No idea what you're saying.

15:49.967 --> 15:51.140
Man. (Inhales sharply)

15:51.327 --> 15:52.403
I just realized I have
a lot to teach you

15:52.495 --> 15:54.398
before I go off to college.
(Blows air)

15:54.490 --> 15:56.479
Okay. Listen and learn.

15:56.571 --> 15:57.998
(Groans)

15:58.920 --> 16:00.672
Say there's a cute girl
standing in front of you.

16:00.788 --> 16:03.254
First, you make eye contact.

16:03.415 --> 16:07.254
Now... you wanna
squint just a little.

16:07.522 --> 16:11.202
Okay. Now just tip your head
just slightly.

16:11.347 --> 16:14.844
Now... imagine you're
smelling some...

16:15.120 --> 16:17.169
(Sniffs) really awesome
tater tots.

16:17.265 --> 16:19.531
(Sniffs) That's it, dude!
You nailed it!

16:19.630 --> 16:22.088
Did I? I felt I nailed it.

16:22.310 --> 16:23.610
(Grunts)

16:24.259 --> 16:25.892
<i>(Horror movie music
playing on TV)</i> Sue? Sue?

16:25.984 --> 16:27.945
- Ouch!
- Oh, sorry, Jenna.

16:28.077 --> 16:30.025
Carly, I hardly stepped on you.
<i>(Chain saw whirring on TV)</i>

16:30.154 --> 16:32.706
(Sighs) I'm just, uh, trying
to upload our photos to Facebook

16:32.814 --> 16:33.983
and I don't know how.

16:34.069 --> 16:35.207
Mom, we're watching a movie.

16:35.301 --> 16:36.546
Yeah. I know. I know.

16:36.641 --> 16:38.404
But I just thought it'd be fun
to post the pics now.

16:38.497 --> 16:41.068
- Why? Who cares?
- Because that way it'll be done.

16:41.313 --> 16:43.341
Fine. Just click on
the camera icon

16:43.468 --> 16:44.754
and then click "Import."

16:44.850 --> 16:46.460
Got it, got it, got it.
Okay.

16:46.587 --> 16:48.220
- Oh, no. Oh, no.
- Oh, God.

16:48.348 --> 16:49.252
- No, no, no!
- I can't watch!

16:49.372 --> 16:50.749
- I'm freaking out!
- I can't watch! I can't watch!

16:50.894 --> 16:52.525
(Girls) Aah!

16:52.626 --> 16:53.575
Oh, that is so cute!
(Screaming continues)

16:53.681 --> 16:55.851
Okay, hold on. No one move.
I'm gonna get my camera.

16:56.220 --> 16:58.296
Okay,
I-I think he went away.

16:58.405 --> 16:59.501
(Girls sigh)

16:59.706 --> 17:01.390
- Okay, I am never going to bed again.
- Oh, my God.

17:01.497 --> 17:03.188
- Can we sleep with the lights on tonight?
- Yes. Yes.

17:03.292 --> 17:04.577
So was that the man?
(Sighing)

17:04.704 --> 17:06.944
- No, it was the creepy grandpa.
- He's alive?

17:07.077 --> 17:08.733
- Yeah.
- Okay...

17:09.538 --> 17:10.648
Wait. What happened?

17:10.765 --> 17:11.736
Oh, you were all so cute
together

17:11.837 --> 17:14.183
huddled up next to each other.
Get back to the way you were.

17:14.284 --> 17:16.095
No, mom, we're really good
on pictures.

17:16.185 --> 17:17.285
Oh, you can never have enough.

17:17.368 --> 17:18.847
Ally, get back
in your sleeping bag.

17:18.945 --> 17:19.969
But I'm sort of hot.

17:20.068 --> 17:21.872
Chloe, weren't you
over there next to Sue?

17:21.990 --> 17:23.545
Uh, I guess so, but--

17:23.644 --> 17:25.494
Mom, she doesn't want
to get up.

17:25.595 --> 17:27.858
- Oh, she doesn't have to get up. Here
you go. - Oh, I can't see the movie.

17:27.973 --> 17:29.320
- There. Okay.
- Mom!

17:29.441 --> 17:31.890
There you go. And, Jenna,
I think you were over here,

17:32.004 --> 17:33.875
- weren't you?
- Actually, I'm okay, Mrs. Heck.

17:34.000 --> 17:34.984
Okay, that's good!
(Shrieks)

17:35.071 --> 17:36.363
Oh, this is gonna be so cute!
(Gasps)

17:36.468 --> 17:38.514
Just come over here, and we'll
just do it like that.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.343
- Mom, stop!
- That's great.

17:40.532 --> 17:43.341
Okay, okay. Everybody get
a little closer together.

17:43.505 --> 17:45.972
Okay, perfect.
Here we go.

17:46.094 --> 17:47.631
Come on, Carly, look alive.

17:47.756 --> 17:49.356
(Gasps) (Static hissing)

17:49.498 --> 17:52.630
Mom, what did you do?

17:52.982 --> 17:54.373
Oh, wait.
Oh, but you know what?

17:54.476 --> 17:55.290
This is so funny!

17:55.398 --> 17:57.070
Okay, everybody do this.

17:57.154 --> 17:59.905
"Ohh! We're so sad
we lost the movie!

17:59.984 --> 18:00.976
Ohh!" (Laughs)

18:01.077 --> 18:02.756
Everybody put your hands
on your cheeks,

18:02.853 --> 18:04.723
and then-- Sue, you come
forward a little bit,

18:04.834 --> 18:05.822
'cause you have to be
the saddest

18:05.901 --> 18:08.035
'cause it's your party.
Okay, you ready? "Ohh!"

18:09.014 --> 18:11.753
Mom, can I see you
for a minute?

18:14.569 --> 18:15.949
What are you doing?

18:16.061 --> 18:17.850
You're wrecking my sleepover.

18:17.970 --> 18:20.529
Just <i>go... away.</i>

18:20.625 --> 18:21.962
Fine. I'm sorry.
I'm going.

18:22.128 --> 18:22.980
(Sighs)

18:25.331 --> 18:26.349
(Shutter clicking)

18:33.788 --> 18:36.246
Axl, can I ask you something?

18:36.528 --> 18:38.414
When you said you're
leaving to go to college,

18:38.546 --> 18:40.677
what did you mean by that?

18:41.821 --> 18:43.565
That I'll be leaving
for college.

18:43.669 --> 18:45.553
But you'll still
be living here, right?

18:45.658 --> 18:46.579
Mm, no.

18:46.681 --> 18:48.982
Brick, I'm...
gonna be living at college.

18:49.085 --> 18:50.294
That's kinda how it works.

18:50.390 --> 18:52.789
- What did you think was gonna happen?
- I don't know.

18:52.906 --> 18:54.346
I guess I thought
it'd just stay like this

18:54.489 --> 18:57.244
and then eventually you'd
move into mom and dad's room.

18:58.201 --> 19:00.723
I just can't believe
you're really leaving.

19:01.312 --> 19:02.791
Bro, don't worry.

19:02.898 --> 19:04.452
I'll be home at Christmas
to pick up my presents.

19:04.548 --> 19:06.443
And you can come visit me
if you want.

19:06.597 --> 19:08.877
Might even need you to do
some of my homework.

19:10.551 --> 19:11.689
(Groans)

19:12.733 --> 19:13.524
(Clicks switch)

19:13.879 --> 19:15.368
(Sighs)

19:16.916 --> 19:18.969
(Exhales)

19:20.826 --> 19:23.343
I'm really gonna miss you, Axl.

19:23.870 --> 19:25.396
I know, Brick.

19:25.501 --> 19:26.911
Everyone will.

19:29.113 --> 19:29.937
(Girls laughing)

19:30.050 --> 19:32.268
Sounds like Sue and the girls
are having fun out there.

19:32.364 --> 19:35.832
What's the point if I can't
post any of it on Facebook?

19:35.958 --> 19:37.455
(Sighs) Okay.

19:37.556 --> 19:39.241
Repeat that again slowly
so I know

19:39.352 --> 19:40.609
just what to tell the doctors

19:40.711 --> 19:42.215
when I have you committed.

19:42.324 --> 19:43.053
(Groans)

19:43.167 --> 19:44.617
Seriously?
You wanna know the point?

19:44.723 --> 19:46.890
The point is, they're
all having a great time.

19:46.985 --> 19:48.918
But no one will know.

19:49.014 --> 19:51.270
Who cares? <i>They</i> know.

19:51.399 --> 19:53.136
What is going on with you
lately, Frankie?

19:53.307 --> 19:54.856
(Sighs) I don't know.

19:55.021 --> 19:57.363
It's just that Sue's
such an amazing person.

19:57.458 --> 20:00.113
I want everyone to see
how amazing she is.

20:00.204 --> 20:02.249
She is the same person
she was two weeks ago

20:02.351 --> 20:05.240
before you started
poking around on her Facebook.

20:05.341 --> 20:07.785
Now you're all caught up
in who's looking at her page

20:07.892 --> 20:10.217
and who's commenting,
and none of it's real.

20:10.323 --> 20:11.786
None of it means anything.

20:11.880 --> 20:15.749
You're letting other people
define who Sue is to you.

20:17.313 --> 20:19.358
Maybe I can't handle Facebook.

20:19.474 --> 20:20.892
"Maybe"?

20:21.000 --> 20:23.475
Look, Frankie,
Sue is gonna be fine.

20:23.572 --> 20:25.063
No, she's gonna be great.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.966
(Sighs) You're right,
you're right.

20:27.658 --> 20:31.941
Oh. If you had a "Like" button,
I would click it right now.

20:32.076 --> 20:33.537
Don't know what that means.

20:34.805 --> 20:38.325
<i>So that night, I deleted</i>
<i>all my Facebook aliases.</i>

20:38.426 --> 20:41.188
<i>And Sue was sadly unfriended</i>
<i>by Jill Munroe,</i>

20:41.323 --> 20:45.046
<i>Sabrina Duncan,</i>
<i>Julie McCoy, and Chrissy Snow.</i>

20:45.141 --> 20:47.546
<i>But on the upside,</i>
<i>she did get 102 likes</i>

20:47.645 --> 20:48.893
<i>on one of her pictures--</i>

20:48.988 --> 20:50.825
<i>not that it matters.</i>

20:50.909 --> 20:53.867
<i>And Axl and Brick found homes</i>
<i>for the entire cast,</i>

20:53.963 --> 20:55.434
<i>but with one rule--</i>

20:55.518 --> 20:57.739
They're brothers, so we'd like
to keep them together.

20:57.934 --> 21:00.347
<i>Yep, social media</i>
<i>causes a lot of problems,</i>

21:00.467 --> 21:03.329
<i>but in the end,</i>
<i>it does have its uses.</i>

21:03.472 --> 21:06.043
Hey, it's Sunday. I thought
you'd be with my dad.

21:06.137 --> 21:09.030
Nope. I found him some
new friends to talk to.

21:09.131 --> 21:10.663
49 of them, to be exact.

21:10.756 --> 21:12.597
<i>I said it to Dukakis</i>
<i>when I met him,</i>

21:12.680 --> 21:15.526
<i>and I'm gonna say it you--</i>
<i>don't avoid swimming</i>

21:15.628 --> 21:18.056
<i>just 'cause you're afraid</i>
<i>to put on a bathing suit.</i>

21:18.160 --> 21:19.881
<i>And if you're gonna go</i>
<i>to a public pool,</i>

21:19.990 --> 21:22.157
<i>for God sake, shower shoes.</i>

21:22.370 --> 21:24.138
<i>Without your feet,</i>
<i>you got nothing.</i>

21:24.250 --> 21:27.080
<i>Your feet are the hands</i>
<i>of your legs.</i>

21:27.254 --> 21:31.722
<i>- You also got to...</i>
- I like this, Frankie. I like it a lot.

21:31.980 --> 21:34.374
<i>Wait an hour after you eat</i>
<i>before you go in swimming.</i>

21:34.513 --> 21:36.985
<i>But I say if it's not</i>
<i>the internet,</i>

21:37.228 --> 21:38.599
<i>it's the real thing.</i>
