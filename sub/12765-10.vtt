WEBVTT

00:00.601 --> 00:02.585
<i>Prevously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:02.605 --> 00:04.388
We'll have to start at the beginning.

00:04.408 --> 00:06.740
Einstein spent seven weeks
longer in his mother's womb.

00:06.760 --> 00:08.124
That's why he was smarter.

00:08.144 --> 00:10.775
<i>I worked years developing
an artificial womb.</i>

00:10.875 --> 00:13.463
It was supported by a secret
group known as Latnok.

00:13.483 --> 00:16.181
When you first came here,
everything in the world was new.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.185
Adam created me,
but you are my family.

00:19.353 --> 00:22.795
I saw you kissing Jessi.
It just wouldn't be appropriate.

00:22.815 --> 00:24.007
It won't happen again.

00:24.027 --> 00:26.844
When you kissed me, I felt such
a rush. Didn't you feel it?

00:26.944 --> 00:29.017
My heart says there's
still something there.

00:29.154 --> 00:31.903
As much as I want us to be
together, we can't.

00:32.573 --> 00:34.861
<i>- My Mom's changed our plans.
- Josh doesn't know?</i>

00:34.993 --> 00:37.068
- This is our last night together.
- Stop.

00:37.088 --> 00:39.872
No heartfelt goodbyes.
Tonight is about you and me.

00:42.626 --> 00:44.251
You're going straight to bed.

00:44.271 --> 00:46.629
- Who are you?
- Michael Cassidy.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.756
They put enormous pressure
on me to bring you in.

00:48.856 --> 00:50.951
They wanted their greatest
achievement on their side.

00:50.971 --> 00:52.360
Why the interest in Cassidy?

00:52.380 --> 00:54.146
I don't like him.
The guy creeps me out.

00:54.246 --> 00:56.290
You know what I would like to
hear about? My mother.

00:56.310 --> 00:57.801
I think it's beholding upon me

00:57.821 --> 01:00.402
to tell you what sort of person
you have living under your roof.

01:00.422 --> 01:03.252
<i>After the explosion,
she came across a man camping.</i>

01:03.272 --> 01:04.730
<i>And she killed him.</i>

01:04.750 --> 01:06.689
- Oh, my God.
- It's in her nature.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.592
He murdered my mother.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.923
She knew I was Latnok.
She was gonna kill me.

01:12.943 --> 01:15.282
Baylin's experiment...
we're starting it up again.

01:15.382 --> 01:16.435
Sarah found out.

01:16.455 --> 01:17.935
I'm already a murderer!

01:20.038 --> 01:22.498
<i>- How did it go at the Rack?
- Just like we wanted.</i>

01:22.518 --> 01:25.115
- Kyle's still out there with Cassidy.
- Kyle can handle him.

01:25.135 --> 01:27.949
You saved my life. I will take
care of this. Do you trust me?

01:28.105 --> 01:28.940
I do.

01:33.094 --> 01:33.959
<i>Ruse.</i>

01:34.279 --> 01:35.179
<i>Charade.</i>

01:35.625 --> 01:36.624
<i>Deception.</i>

01:36.946 --> 01:40.182
<i>No matter how you define the words,
they begin and end with a lie.</i>

01:44.855 --> 01:45.980
Here you go, mate.

01:46.334 --> 01:49.912
My mum always said
tea was medicine for the soul.

01:51.527 --> 01:52.832
How are you feeling?

01:53.830 --> 01:55.236
How should I feel?

01:55.959 --> 01:58.165
It's going to take some going through.

01:58.724 --> 02:00.900
You've been through a lot tonight.

02:04.764 --> 02:07.067
What are you going to
tell everyone else at Latnok?

02:07.087 --> 02:09.741
This group here don't need
to know anything other than

02:09.762 --> 02:13.213
what you're gonna tell your family
about Jessi running away.

02:13.923 --> 02:15.511
But the senior
members, they know.

02:15.611 --> 02:18.177
- You told them already?
- It's my job, mate.

02:19.242 --> 02:20.639
Got to keep them up to speed.

02:21.649 --> 02:23.559
But they're not even
care that Jessi's dead?

02:24.660 --> 02:26.771
You have to understand.
You're their guy.

02:27.394 --> 02:28.898
You always have been.

02:31.061 --> 02:31.956
Come on.

02:33.214 --> 02:34.973
I want to show you something.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:44.252 --> 02:45.956
- Was this mine?
- The one and only.

02:46.124 --> 02:47.614
Took a little maneuvering

02:47.634 --> 02:50.557
to rebuild it after
the explosion at ZZYZX, but,

02:51.314 --> 02:53.631
that's why our young
geniuses come in so handy.

02:54.493 --> 02:55.989
They rebuilt this?

02:56.677 --> 02:57.990
Not exactly.

02:58.717 --> 03:00.411
They built it in pieces.

03:00.888 --> 03:02.223
Mark's algorithms.

03:02.472 --> 03:04.031
Nate's hoverboard magnets.

03:04.131 --> 03:06.138
Everyone contributed something.

03:06.603 --> 03:07.770
You tricked them.

03:08.368 --> 03:10.689
Their inventions had
practical applications.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.192
- That's all they needed to know.
- What did I give you?

03:13.470 --> 03:15.152
I'm sure you can figure it out.

03:18.927 --> 03:21.106
The growth accelerant
that Nate and I developed.

03:21.206 --> 03:23.463
- Helps with muscle growth.
- Why didn't you just tell me

03:23.483 --> 03:25.829
that this is what
you were doing when you brought me in?

03:25.849 --> 03:28.302
And how would you have
felt about that?

03:30.014 --> 03:31.659
If ZZYZX had their way,

03:31.759 --> 03:33.562
I would have spent my entire life

03:33.582 --> 03:35.849
in this pod as some
type of bio-computer.

03:36.225 --> 03:39.131
That's not the kind of technology
you want falling into the wrong hands.

03:39.261 --> 03:40.670
There's your answer.

03:40.770 --> 03:42.599
They knew you wouldn't approve.

03:42.699 --> 03:43.813
They were right.

03:43.833 --> 03:44.746
But...

03:44.766 --> 03:47.454
you don't really have a choice
in the matter, do you?

03:47.554 --> 03:49.359
Unless you want everyone you know

03:49.379 --> 03:51.547
to know the truth about
what you did to Jessi.

03:51.647 --> 03:53.095
Is that what this is?

03:53.644 --> 03:54.859
More blackmail?

03:54.993 --> 03:57.720
I like to think of it
as self-preservation.

04:00.394 --> 04:02.480
We gonna have
a problem with that?

04:04.342 --> 04:05.148
No.

04:05.611 --> 04:07.538
Look, in a couple of days,

04:07.706 --> 04:10.517
Latnok are gonna have a
warehouse full

04:10.617 --> 04:13.569
of specimens in gestation
to keep them occupied.

04:15.636 --> 04:17.366
They already have
everything they need?

04:17.656 --> 04:19.757
I have everything they need.

04:23.034 --> 04:24.776
I give it to them...

04:25.618 --> 04:26.849
they leave you alone.

04:28.856 --> 04:30.603
Consider this your freedom.

04:31.596 --> 04:32.816
My gift to you.

04:40.824 --> 04:43.288
<i>My lies had brought
me an offer of freedom.</i>

04:43.513 --> 04:45.566
<i>But now Adam's misguided experiment</i>

04:45.586 --> 04:47.762
<i>was in the hands of a blackmailer...</i>

04:47.862 --> 04:48.982
<i>a murderer.</i>

04:53.422 --> 04:56.569
<i>I knew I wouldn't truly be free
until I stopped him.</i>

05:07.441 --> 05:10.573
<font color=#00FFFF>Season 3 Episode 10:
Bringing Down The House</font>

05:17.919 --> 05:19.026
Thank God.

05:19.189 --> 05:20.369
You're okay?

05:20.695 --> 05:23.364
It worked. I got him
to tell me everything.

05:23.610 --> 05:26.307
- What did he say?
- I'll explain it all, I promise.

05:26.407 --> 05:28.994
But I need to see Jessi.
I need to know that she's okay.

05:30.872 --> 05:31.920
I'm okay.

06:13.044 --> 06:13.849
Your...

06:13.869 --> 06:15.708
arms are growing.

06:17.384 --> 06:18.502
They are?

06:21.293 --> 06:24.456
They're at least a half-centimeter
bigger in circumference.

06:24.476 --> 06:26.468
Have you increased
your exercise regimen?

06:27.515 --> 06:29.096
Maybe a little.

06:31.933 --> 06:32.876
Your...

06:34.090 --> 06:37.130
Your pectoral
muscles are also expanding.

06:42.940 --> 06:43.916
What?

06:44.135 --> 06:45.268
Your hand...

06:46.173 --> 06:47.223
feels nice.

06:59.092 --> 06:59.900
Does...

07:00.485 --> 07:01.665
this one, too?

07:18.312 --> 07:19.789
Did you just shock me?

07:19.889 --> 07:21.357
No. Why would I shock you?

07:21.457 --> 07:23.145
I don't know. I...

07:23.245 --> 07:25.508
I felt a charge
go through my body.

07:25.608 --> 07:27.359
- That's your libido.
- What?

07:29.384 --> 07:30.445
No it isn't.

07:31.115 --> 07:33.077
I would have felt that before.

07:33.245 --> 07:35.441
You never felt a charge with Amanda?

07:35.657 --> 07:37.458
I felt other things.

07:37.702 --> 07:40.482
Well, maybe there was a power
surge in the area.

07:41.895 --> 07:42.992
Maybe.

07:45.142 --> 07:47.517
So, how did you sleep
last night?

07:49.049 --> 07:50.427
I didn't.

07:50.733 --> 07:52.179
Neither did I.

07:57.287 --> 07:59.228
I'm sorry you had to
go through that.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.397
I'm sure it wasn't easy...

08:02.565 --> 08:04.300
confronting Cassidy
about Sarah.

08:05.232 --> 08:06.607
I was acting.

08:14.668 --> 08:15.682
I'm fine.

08:16.725 --> 08:17.663
I promise.

08:26.696 --> 08:28.630
There's that power surge again.

08:42.207 --> 08:45.394
Josh is still asleep, but I talked
to Lori about what's going on.

08:46.386 --> 08:48.696
I'll finish getting dressed
and be right out.

08:51.044 --> 08:53.748
I'll be in the other room,
pretending to be dead.

08:56.584 --> 08:58.150
I'm not happy about this.

08:58.847 --> 09:02.761
I'm sorry. Jessi came in,
and things got weird. But,

09:03.242 --> 09:05.608
- It won't happen again.
- Not that. Well,

09:05.628 --> 09:07.907
yes, that. But more importantly,
I don't like this game

09:07.927 --> 09:10.764
you guys are playing with Cassidy.
It's dangerous.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.185
I don't like it either.

09:12.205 --> 09:14.511
Kyle, I've given you a lot
of leeway in the past,

09:14.785 --> 09:16.668
but this just feels different.

09:16.768 --> 09:19.748
There's something about it.
Something about Cassidy...

09:20.680 --> 09:21.935
He scares me.

09:22.693 --> 09:24.563
I'm going to take care of it.

09:24.731 --> 09:25.766
I promise.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.512
I need it to be over.

09:27.801 --> 09:30.294
We can't keep doing this
to our family.

09:51.134 --> 09:54.054
Hide and seek with parents
downstairs is not cool.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.066
Straight to voice mail?
Not cool.

10:10.086 --> 10:12.324
Leaving without saying
goodbye? Even less cool.

10:12.344 --> 10:13.487
What's wrong with you?

10:16.204 --> 10:17.398
Call me back.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.991
Can anyone help me figure out how to
throttle my girlfriend long-distance?

10:22.011 --> 10:24.146
- Why long-distance?
- Because she left.

10:24.354 --> 10:27.336
Vamoosed. Hitched a ride
on the a-train to Cleveland.

10:27.691 --> 10:29.831
She didn't even have the
courage to tell me in person.

10:29.851 --> 10:31.364
She left this on my pillow.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.798
On your pillow?

10:34.636 --> 10:35.454
Ask Dad.

10:35.593 --> 10:36.578
Oh, I will.

10:36.719 --> 10:37.520
Mom?

10:38.503 --> 10:39.497
Are you okay?

10:39.705 --> 10:40.844
You know what?

10:41.043 --> 10:41.849
Yeah.

10:42.249 --> 10:44.460
If she's just gonna up and
leave like that, forget her.

10:44.560 --> 10:45.431
I'm fine.

10:45.763 --> 10:47.652
Dandy.
Copa-freakin'-cetic.

10:47.752 --> 10:49.690
She was probably
afraid to say goodbye.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.942
Then she's a coward.
Good riddance.

10:53.134 --> 10:54.394
Josh, I'm sorry.

10:54.865 --> 10:57.040
But there's something else
we need to talk about...

11:00.471 --> 11:02.335
Here's what I have so far.

11:02.986 --> 11:04.226
Leave it open.

11:06.808 --> 11:07.703
Well, um...

11:08.831 --> 11:11.818
In order to fill,
say, 100 pods,

11:11.918 --> 11:15.024
Cassidy would need at least
5,000 gallons of formula on hand.

11:15.124 --> 11:17.335
Not to mention the space
he'd need to house the pods.

11:17.435 --> 11:18.385
Now I ran a search,

11:18.405 --> 11:21.977
and there are over 5300 warehouses
in Seattle that are big enough.

11:22.449 --> 11:25.261
The formula would have to be
kept at a certain temperature

11:25.483 --> 11:27.817
in order to sustain its
nutritional elements...

11:27.837 --> 11:30.314
probably a few degrees
below body temperature.

11:30.482 --> 11:32.407
That's a way to narrow it down.

11:34.744 --> 11:37.713
We can access the city
police's thermal imaging scans,

11:38.068 --> 11:40.513
like how they find the
people growing the weed.

11:40.808 --> 11:42.161
- The weed?
- Yeah, the...

11:42.261 --> 11:43.238
The blaze.

11:43.663 --> 11:44.615
The herb.

11:44.715 --> 11:45.653
The chronic.

11:45.753 --> 11:47.651
- Where did you pick that up?
- Cable.

11:49.755 --> 11:51.965
Once we find where
they're hiding the formula,

11:52.065 --> 11:54.135
we need to sabotage it
so that it doesn't work.

11:54.374 --> 11:56.248
And destroy any way of
re-creating it.

11:56.268 --> 11:58.175
What about the pods?
How do we destroy them?

11:58.195 --> 12:01.196
We won't need to. Without the
formula, they're useless.

12:05.350 --> 12:06.197
Where?

12:06.297 --> 12:07.547
I hear her heartbeat.

12:07.567 --> 12:09.779
You're still listening
for her heartbeat?

12:10.025 --> 12:11.647
It comes naturally now.

12:13.246 --> 12:14.900
She's coming to the window.

12:15.217 --> 12:18.504
You've gotta go. She can't see
you. You're supposed to be missing.

12:27.132 --> 12:27.932
Hi.

12:28.032 --> 12:28.955
I'm sorry.

12:29.431 --> 12:31.593
I know this is weird,
but I really need to talk to you

12:31.613 --> 12:33.721
and I don't want
anyone else to know about it.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.005
What happened?

12:36.237 --> 12:37.522
Here, come in.

12:44.434 --> 12:46.850
- I think you were right about Nate.
- What did he do?

12:46.870 --> 12:49.132
I found all this odd
research in his dorm room.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.872
You were in his dorm room?

12:52.546 --> 12:54.712
I saw the number from
the Ouija board.

12:54.812 --> 12:57.085
When you asked
what your birthday was?

12:57.185 --> 12:58.652
781227.

12:58.672 --> 13:01.141
There were drawings
of these chambers...

13:01.954 --> 13:05.092
that could carry a baby without
a birth mother. Or an umbilical cord.

13:05.578 --> 13:08.036
Your father's name,
Adam Baylin, was everywhere.

13:08.705 --> 13:11.794
I know you have secrets,
and I try not to pry, but Kyle,

13:12.095 --> 13:15.766
- it's like he was studying your life.
- Amanda, does he know you saw all of this?

13:16.708 --> 13:18.434
You said there were people
who would use

13:18.454 --> 13:20.346
those you care about to get to you.

13:20.366 --> 13:21.831
Is he one of them?

13:22.432 --> 13:23.802
I think he might be.

13:25.437 --> 13:27.217
Why do I always do this?

13:27.317 --> 13:30.475
Why do I always get involved
with the lying, cheating jerks?

13:34.028 --> 13:34.980
I'm sorry.

13:36.722 --> 13:38.676
Amanda, I need you
to stay away from him.

13:39.092 --> 13:41.333
I can't guarantee it's safe
to be around him.

13:45.070 --> 13:45.949
What?

13:46.835 --> 13:47.952
It's you.

13:49.624 --> 13:52.046
The Charlies,
the Nates of this world...

13:52.497 --> 13:53.957
those are the real jerks.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.075
You,

13:55.175 --> 13:56.296
no matter what,

13:56.396 --> 13:58.420
are one of the good guys.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.243
I always knew you were.

14:00.875 --> 14:02.299
Even when I thought I didn't.

14:02.947 --> 14:03.990
I try to be.

14:04.506 --> 14:05.605
You are.

14:35.530 --> 14:38.728
<i>Kissing Amanda, I felt
a rolling flutter deep inside.</i>

14:39.267 --> 14:41.067
<i>I'd heard the term before,</i>

14:41.305 --> 14:42.585
<i>'butterflies.'</i>

14:43.191 --> 14:46.435
<i>How was it possible to feel
electricity for one person</i>

14:46.535 --> 14:48.604
<i>and butterflies for another?</i>

15:01.174 --> 15:03.228
I think Cassidy has
Adam's data stored

15:03.248 --> 15:05.562
on an isolated server
at the university.

15:05.662 --> 15:08.210
I saw the system last night.
If I can get back in there,

15:08.310 --> 15:11.628
I can swap it out with a dummy drive
and figure out if he made any back-ups.

15:12.018 --> 15:13.539
I need to get rid of all of them.

15:13.559 --> 15:16.436
Don't you think Cassidy
would be watching you closely?

15:16.456 --> 15:18.523
I'll need some sort of distraction.

15:21.100 --> 15:22.256
You can't go.

15:22.953 --> 15:24.722
- You're dead.
- I know.

15:24.822 --> 15:26.672
And dead girls
get stuck in the house

15:26.692 --> 15:28.898
doing thermal scans of
Seattle's industrial district.

15:28.918 --> 15:31.304
I almost hate to suggest it,
but what about Mark?

15:32.682 --> 15:34.641
We don't know
if we can fully trust him yet.

15:34.741 --> 15:35.555
I do.

15:35.777 --> 15:38.155
I mean, based on my little
recon mission last night,

15:38.175 --> 15:40.169
we know he's no fan of Cassidy's.

15:40.269 --> 15:42.801
And I know it's not my life
we're talking about, but,

15:42.901 --> 15:45.470
your secret is my secret, too.
It's all of ours.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.905
Do we have to spend the rest of our
lives not ever letting anyone else in?

15:48.925 --> 15:52.275
This situation is too extreme, Lori.
No matter how much you care about him.

15:52.667 --> 15:53.879
The problem is,

15:53.979 --> 15:56.494
we don't have anyone else
who has an excuse to be in Latnok.

15:57.485 --> 15:59.358
That's not entirely true.

16:09.183 --> 16:11.803
What is this, Bring
Your Mother to Work Day?

16:22.395 --> 16:25.179
I'm sorry, Michael. I hate
to bother you like this, but,

16:25.199 --> 16:27.597
can I speak to you?
It's about last night.

16:29.092 --> 16:31.835
I know I wasn't the best dinner guest,
but I didn't think my behavior

16:31.855 --> 16:33.746
- warranted a house call.
- No, it's Jessi.

16:33.766 --> 16:35.088
She never came home.

16:36.390 --> 16:37.733
I see. I'm sorry.

16:38.015 --> 16:38.860
Come in.

16:39.677 --> 16:40.522
Thanks.

16:43.405 --> 16:46.020
So, she wasn't at her apartment?

16:46.040 --> 16:47.573
First place I checked.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.576
I don't know why I thought
she might come here,

16:49.596 --> 16:52.217
especially after
your confrontation. But,

16:52.317 --> 16:54.202
I didn't know where else to look.

16:54.302 --> 16:56.359
Yeah, I'm sorry.
This is my fault.

16:56.459 --> 16:57.675
Oh, please, no.

16:58.024 --> 17:00.977
It's not the first time
she's run away, unfortunately...

17:18.644 --> 17:21.358
- Where did she go the last time?
- The woods.

17:21.458 --> 17:24.041
It's a long story, and yes,
we've already looked.

17:24.531 --> 17:26.430
She's had a rough go of it.

17:26.964 --> 17:29.091
You used to counsel her, didn't you?

17:34.356 --> 17:35.660
Is there a problem?

17:35.760 --> 17:37.630
No, not at all. It's just...

17:37.730 --> 17:39.579
It's a bit of a sore subject.

17:39.679 --> 17:42.852
I received a warning for taking her in.
I almost lost my license.

17:50.309 --> 17:52.750
Well, she was very lucky
to have had you helping her.

17:52.850 --> 17:53.982
Thank you.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.262
It's nice to feel appreciated.

17:57.903 --> 17:59.884
You've done an
amazing job with Kyle.

17:59.904 --> 18:02.080
All I know,
you mean a lot to him.

18:03.086 --> 18:04.619
He means a lot to us.

18:13.617 --> 18:14.902
Are you cleaning?

18:15.105 --> 18:17.952
In a manner of speaking, yes.
I am cleaning my life.

18:18.500 --> 18:21.840
I have too many things that remind
me of Andy. I am purging...

18:23.052 --> 18:26.477
And please don't touch anything.
It's all exactly where I want it.

18:33.314 --> 18:34.934
Staphylococcus aureus.

18:35.177 --> 18:36.990
No. That is in fact a cup.

18:37.158 --> 18:39.325
Inside the cup. The bacteria.

18:39.696 --> 18:41.389
How long has this been here?

18:41.720 --> 18:44.056
Could be this morning...
Could be last month...

18:44.156 --> 18:46.871
Your room is the perfect
environment for it to grow.

18:46.971 --> 18:48.850
It's warm, dark,

18:49.342 --> 18:50.776
and a little...

18:50.796 --> 18:52.213
- Manly?
- Dank.

18:53.018 --> 18:55.076
Why am I letting you stand in my
room and insult me?

18:55.096 --> 18:56.953
- Because your dankness...
- Manliness.

18:56.973 --> 18:59.832
Just gave me an idea of how
to disable the formula.

19:11.248 --> 19:15.445
<i>I needed to burn Adam's journals
to erase his records of the experiment.</i>

19:29.919 --> 19:32.715
<i>But I knew I was also burning
the only real connection I had</i>

19:32.735 --> 19:34.964
<i>to the man who had given me life.</i>

19:36.133 --> 19:38.027
<i>And the way he had given it.</i>

19:42.036 --> 19:43.526
Thank you for earlier.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.391
I'm just glad it's over.

19:47.648 --> 19:50.419
According to the hard drive,
he made a single backup of data.

19:50.439 --> 19:53.024
I think I saw the disc in his
safe when I found Sarah's ring.

19:53.044 --> 19:55.535
He'll have moved it by now.
Maybe to his apartment.

19:55.735 --> 19:57.487
Now you're breaking
into his apartment?

19:58.319 --> 20:00.373
If I don't destroy every trace
of this formula,

20:00.393 --> 20:01.908
he'll just re-create it.

20:02.076 --> 20:04.227
I have to make sure
that doesn't happen.

20:05.189 --> 20:08.350
I can't help wishing you'd just
taken him up on his offer of freedom.

20:10.529 --> 20:12.717
They're re-starting the experiment.

20:13.599 --> 20:14.874
They're playing God!

20:15.006 --> 20:17.989
And if Cassidy is any indication
of the kind of people they are,

20:18.009 --> 20:20.802
- I don't want them to have that power.
- I understand.

20:21.255 --> 20:24.509
I do. But the deeper in you get,
the more it's changing you.

20:25.047 --> 20:28.224
- Changing me?
- You fake Jessi's death.

20:28.837 --> 20:29.795
You're lying,

20:29.815 --> 20:32.311
you're sneaking around,
breaking laws...

20:33.315 --> 20:34.854
This just isn't you.

20:36.127 --> 20:38.308
At least it's not
who you used to be.

20:54.163 --> 20:56.610
- Thanks for coming with me.
- Are you kidding?

20:56.630 --> 20:59.050
Being your lookout,
breaking into someone's apartment...

20:59.070 --> 21:02.083
It's like the old days.
I'd be pissed if you hadn't asked me.

21:02.103 --> 21:03.248
This is it.

21:03.739 --> 21:05.595
I have the keys
to Jessi's apartment.

21:05.615 --> 21:08.120
I'll go in there, climb through
the air-conditioning ducts,

21:08.140 --> 21:09.852
and then drop down into Cassidy's.

21:09.872 --> 21:11.965
Or, I could just pick the lock.

21:14.442 --> 21:15.679
Don't ask.

21:16.174 --> 21:17.950
Isn't that breaking and entering?

21:18.050 --> 21:19.891
It was okay when you
were just entering?

21:24.565 --> 21:26.242
Let's see what we find.

21:27.101 --> 21:29.404
Cassidy's passport
and birth certificate.

21:29.505 --> 21:32.874
- In case of a quick getaway, I guess.
- He's not using his real name.

21:32.894 --> 21:35.216
It says he's Michael Cassidy Kingsley.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.462
Mother, Grace.
Father, unknown.

21:39.606 --> 21:40.782
Grace Kingsley.

21:41.575 --> 21:43.586
Why does that name sound familiar?

21:47.762 --> 21:49.102
<i>Grace Kingsley...</i>

21:53.762 --> 21:56.038
Grace Kingsley was
in Adam's notebooks.

21:56.830 --> 21:58.729
She's a member of Latnok.

22:12.350 --> 22:14.235
Easy, killer.
It's just a game.

22:14.375 --> 22:15.783
It's not just a game.

22:15.883 --> 22:18.463
It's our game.
Mine and Andy's.

22:18.815 --> 22:21.247
I thought making things explode
would make me feel better,

22:21.267 --> 22:23.320
but it only reminded me
of how much this sucks.

22:23.340 --> 22:26.010
It does suck.
Believe me, I know.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.207
Lori didn't move thousands
of miles away

22:28.227 --> 22:31.683
while you were still both in love
and leave you without saying goodbye.

22:31.703 --> 22:33.768
All she did was reject
your sorry ass.

22:35.321 --> 22:36.604
I have an idea.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.064
Death by porn?

22:38.636 --> 22:41.359
Just give me a few minutes.
I have to make a call.

22:44.595 --> 22:47.883
If his mother knew Adam,
then she must have known Sarah.

22:48.449 --> 22:50.841
I wonder if she knows
her son is a killer.

22:51.521 --> 22:53.663
This is everything on the disk.

22:58.214 --> 23:01.410
- That's the formula for the fluid.
- You found it.

23:12.294 --> 23:13.850
- It worked.
- What did?

23:14.018 --> 23:16.323
The thermal imaging.
That facility is storing

23:16.343 --> 23:19.170
a large amount of something
at the temperature we were tracking.

23:19.190 --> 23:22.188
Let's assume we're right,
and the existing formula is there.

23:22.208 --> 23:24.242
I'll go,
add your bacteria to the fluid...

23:24.262 --> 23:26.459
and get out before
anyone knows I was there.

23:26.479 --> 23:28.200
I wish I could go with you.

23:30.139 --> 23:31.283
I do, too.

23:36.397 --> 23:39.572
We should see what else is on
the disk before we destroy it.

23:47.242 --> 23:48.926
The pod schematics.

23:50.746 --> 23:53.139
Step one.
Genome insertion.

23:54.032 --> 23:56.372
Step two.
Clone development.

23:57.238 --> 23:59.950
Clone? I thought they
used human embryos.

23:59.970 --> 24:02.187
That's the way
it's always been done.

24:02.700 --> 24:06.069
They must be using someone's
genetic sequence to create a clone.

24:09.840 --> 24:13.046
- 781227.
- That's impossible.

24:17.458 --> 24:20.466
Latnok isn't planning
to gestate babies in those pods.

24:21.074 --> 24:22.448
They're making clones...

24:24.022 --> 24:24.990
of me.

24:33.108 --> 24:35.526
- You've got to be kidding me.
- Is that even possible?

24:35.546 --> 24:38.422
It never was before.
Now with the pods and the formula,

24:38.442 --> 24:41.085
the development process is a
more regulated environment.

24:41.105 --> 24:44.023
I can't even wrap my head around
the breach of scientific ethics.

24:44.043 --> 24:46.005
It's even worse than just cloning.

24:46.025 --> 24:48.706
Jessi and I were in gestation
for sixteen years.

24:48.806 --> 24:51.156
That's what allowed our brains
to develop the way they did.

24:51.176 --> 24:53.475
Without all that time,
we'd be just like everyone else.

24:53.495 --> 24:56.218
So in order for them to create
more children like you...

24:56.238 --> 24:58.507
They would have to be
in the pods for years.

25:00.124 --> 25:02.208
But why just you?
Why not both of you?

25:04.589 --> 25:06.434
They think I'm damaged.

25:07.445 --> 25:10.112
I think we've already
established how wrong they are.

25:10.132 --> 25:12.246
Still, Kyle is special.

25:12.346 --> 25:15.304
It's understandable why they
would want more like him.

25:15.765 --> 25:18.861
If I'm special, it's not because
of how I came into this world.

25:18.961 --> 25:21.487
It's what happened
to me once I was in it.

25:21.587 --> 25:23.025
You took me in.

25:23.125 --> 25:25.380
You loved me like I was
one of your own children.

25:25.480 --> 25:28.163
Having you in my life...
that's what makes me special.

25:28.263 --> 25:31.772
But this, what they're planning, it's
robbing someone of their childhood...

25:31.872 --> 25:35.677
their connection to a mother...
a family. I can't allow that.

25:35.867 --> 25:38.393
Which is why we have to make
sure it doesn't happen.

25:39.640 --> 25:43.699
- Is that mold?
- No. Mold is a fungus.

25:43.719 --> 25:46.337
This is a bacterial agent
that will compound

25:46.357 --> 25:49.055
exponentially when
introduced into a live organism.

25:49.075 --> 25:51.575
It'll basically suffocate any
nutritional elements growing

25:51.595 --> 25:54.298
in the formula,
so it won't allow anything to grow.

25:54.318 --> 25:55.672
Of course it will.

25:57.651 --> 25:59.125
I have to get going.

26:03.346 --> 26:05.105
Just... Be careful.

26:05.547 --> 26:06.564
Please.

26:13.520 --> 26:14.953
I'll be home soon.

26:25.819 --> 26:27.984
Are you sure
you don't need back-up?

26:28.242 --> 26:31.201
We can't risk anyone seeing
you until this is all over.

26:33.090 --> 26:36.162
When it is over,
what happens with your life?

26:37.945 --> 26:39.196
What do you mean?

26:39.296 --> 26:43.086
We'll destroy the experiment.
And then we can focus on Cassidy, but...

26:44.151 --> 26:48.033
one day soon, if we're successful,
your life will just return to normal.

26:49.656 --> 26:52.471
I'm starting to realize
my life can never be normal.

26:53.201 --> 26:56.284
But it would be nice to get back
to some type of constant.

26:58.119 --> 27:00.377
Does constant mean Amanda?

27:07.140 --> 27:09.223
I don't know what it means.

27:10.403 --> 27:12.042
Sorry, Jessi.

27:12.939 --> 27:14.547
I wish I did. I...

27:15.348 --> 27:18.831
wish I could understand how I could
have feelings for more than one person.

27:21.821 --> 27:24.141
You're saying you
have feelings for me?

27:24.955 --> 27:27.110
Why would you even have to ask that?

27:30.347 --> 27:32.275
- What are you looking for?
- Nicole.

27:32.883 --> 27:33.842
Why?

27:47.292 --> 27:48.540
Good luck.

28:01.459 --> 28:03.586
- What happened?
- The lamp blew out.

28:03.974 --> 28:05.119
I'll fix it.

28:10.900 --> 28:13.158
- I rock.
- Why do you rock?

28:13.354 --> 28:15.484
And why aren't we making
me feel any better yet?

28:16.465 --> 28:17.723
Maybe this will.

28:26.330 --> 28:27.130
Hi.

28:27.957 --> 28:30.455
Jackie told me how to hijack
the car's navigational system

28:30.475 --> 28:32.941
and walk Andy through linking
up a video camera.

28:32.961 --> 28:36.099
So even though she's on the road
in the middle of the country,

28:36.119 --> 28:38.049
you get to see your girlfriend.

28:38.149 --> 28:40.736
Don't understand that at all, but...

28:41.417 --> 28:42.747
thanks, man.

28:42.963 --> 28:43.798
Really.

28:44.850 --> 28:46.015
You're welcome.

28:52.106 --> 28:53.442
Where are you?

28:54.127 --> 28:56.436
Some rest stop in North Dakota.

28:56.941 --> 29:00.834
Declan totally hacked into our
minivan's GPS. You're lucky we have one.

29:00.934 --> 29:03.484
Your moms are lesbians.
How could they not?

29:05.587 --> 29:07.928
Are they... listening
to me right now?

29:07.948 --> 29:11.146
Lucky for you, they took
my brothers in to pee.

29:11.166 --> 29:14.003
Good, because you are in
big trouble, young missy.

29:14.208 --> 29:16.379
I know. I totally suck.

29:16.641 --> 29:18.063
You totally do.

29:18.507 --> 29:20.299
How could you not say goodbye?

29:22.084 --> 29:23.579
I chickened out.

29:25.537 --> 29:27.288
I couldn't say goodbye to you.

29:29.916 --> 29:31.257
I still can't.

29:33.339 --> 29:36.525
Well, then it doesn't
have to be goodbye.

29:37.452 --> 29:40.736
It can be hello with
a lot of miles between us.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.169
In that case,

29:44.375 --> 29:45.199
hello.

29:47.128 --> 29:47.932
Hi.

29:50.150 --> 29:53.253
You know what?
We can say hello every day

29:53.273 --> 29:55.119
until I get to see you again.

29:55.861 --> 29:57.586
And then every day after that.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.002
This should only
take about 20 minutes.

30:57.022 --> 30:59.213
Just need to cable the system
and run a quick diagnostic.

30:59.233 --> 31:00.285
No problem.

31:17.397 --> 31:19.962
I imagine you're not
dropping off another lasagna.

31:21.263 --> 31:23.797
- I'll come back later.
- Sorry. But you can't leave.

31:24.644 --> 31:26.737
- Why?
- Because you've seen me.

31:26.837 --> 31:28.960
- Not following.
- I'm supposed to be missing

31:28.980 --> 31:32.270
and if you tell your new boyfriend
that I'm not, you'll ruin everything.

31:32.370 --> 31:35.342
He's not my boyfriend.
He's not anything anymore.

31:35.612 --> 31:37.396
I told Kyle I'd stay away from him,

31:37.416 --> 31:39.725
but he still has all that stuff
about him in his dorm room.

31:39.745 --> 31:41.798
- Why didn't you just take it?
- I don't know.

31:41.818 --> 31:45.221
- Because that would be stealing.
- But Nate stole it in the first place.

31:45.615 --> 31:47.873
I guess it just didn't occur to me,
all right?

31:47.973 --> 31:50.371
- I'm not as smart as you.
- That's true.

31:51.420 --> 31:53.911
I just came to say that Nate's
working until ten tonight,

31:53.931 --> 31:55.951
so if Kyle wants to get
into the room, he can.

31:55.971 --> 31:58.230
- Kyle's not home.
- Then you do it.

31:58.250 --> 32:01.274
- I can't go anywhere.
- You still haven't explained that.

32:01.294 --> 32:02.753
And I don't plan on it.

32:04.647 --> 32:07.042
Look, unfortunately,
you're gonna have to do it.

32:07.155 --> 32:10.288
Do what? Break into his
room and steal his files?

32:10.308 --> 32:12.350
I was thinking firebomb, but okay.

32:44.820 --> 32:46.463
Almost done.
It's just...

32:49.088 --> 32:50.801
You don't have to watch.

32:52.750 --> 32:54.847
Unless you just like... lurking.

33:03.174 --> 33:04.380
Ninety-six percent.

33:06.081 --> 33:07.318
Ninety-seven.

33:18.802 --> 33:21.081
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah, I can hear you.

33:21.249 --> 33:22.937
I'm going to ghost his system.

33:22.957 --> 33:25.545
So, basically it'll be like
I'm sitting right where you are.

33:25.645 --> 33:27.514
Less chance for operator error.

33:30.077 --> 33:32.613
Okay. Open up the systems file.

33:32.713 --> 33:34.582
I need you to get his IP address.

33:34.602 --> 33:37.020
- If you know...
- I know what that is.

33:37.120 --> 33:38.424
Save the sarcasm.

33:39.258 --> 33:41.787
Type it into the "share host"
box down at the bottom.

33:41.887 --> 33:44.104
And change all the
settings to "allow."

33:51.416 --> 33:52.390
Perfect.

33:56.365 --> 33:58.574
There's a lot of stuff
here Nate's been collecting.

33:58.594 --> 33:59.695
<i>About Kyle?</i>

34:00.268 --> 34:01.752
See for yourself.

34:03.184 --> 34:05.547
I've wanted to know
his secrets for so long...

34:06.163 --> 34:07.544
Here it all is.

34:07.812 --> 34:09.607
Yeah, well take a good look.

34:10.967 --> 34:14.630
No. When he's ready to tell me,
then it'll mean something.

34:14.650 --> 34:16.530
For now, this is just weird.

34:16.550 --> 34:18.389
Always the good girl.

34:18.409 --> 34:20.725
Not all of us can be
as wild as you, Jessi.

34:20.745 --> 34:22.251
Apparently, you can.

34:24.828 --> 34:25.806
Amanda?

34:26.900 --> 34:27.940
What's wrong?

34:28.199 --> 34:29.149
Nate...

34:36.379 --> 34:37.603
<i>This is Cassidy.</i>

34:37.623 --> 34:40.148
I just caught Kyle's girlfriends
going through my stuff.

34:40.248 --> 34:42.371
- Girlfriends?
- Amanda and Jessi.

34:42.539 --> 34:45.791
Jessi. That's impossible.
She's... missing.

34:46.072 --> 34:47.960
Well, if she was,
she isn't anymore.

34:49.938 --> 34:51.793
Find out what they know.

34:55.051 --> 34:57.790
Shut it down.
Mr. Cassidy wants everyone out of here.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.865
- I haven't finished yet.
- We have orders.

34:59.965 --> 35:01.512
We need to check the perimeter.

35:26.891 --> 35:28.242
What are you doing?

35:30.675 --> 35:31.881
What is this?

35:32.479 --> 35:33.422
A bacteria.

35:33.442 --> 35:36.421
- A bacteria? Why would you...
- Mark. We don't have much time.

35:36.441 --> 35:39.318
Do you have any idea what
you've been helping Cassidy do?

35:40.682 --> 35:43.202
Computerized in-vitro
gestational chambers.

35:43.222 --> 35:45.006
For women who
can't give birth naturally.

35:45.026 --> 35:46.596
I wish that's what it was.

35:46.616 --> 35:49.575
- What are you talking about?
- Cassidy has been using you.

35:49.791 --> 35:53.204
Latnok is not what they say they are.
And that I need your help.

35:53.951 --> 35:55.765
I need you to trust me.

35:57.353 --> 35:58.238
Please.

36:06.813 --> 36:08.164
I'll distract them.

36:08.607 --> 36:10.690
Just do what you
need to do and get out.

36:31.078 --> 36:32.140
Hello?

36:53.003 --> 36:56.047
You're very anxious, for someone
who's looking for a dead girl.

37:00.801 --> 37:04.275
- I told you, I didn't see anything.
- I wish I could believe that.

37:04.523 --> 37:05.781
I really do.

37:21.959 --> 37:24.681
- Why did you do that?
- I thought you could use the help.

37:24.701 --> 37:26.423
We have to get the files
and get moving.

37:26.443 --> 37:28.460
- He's not gonna be out for very long.
- Why not?

37:28.480 --> 37:30.455
Because you don't hit hard enough.

37:35.635 --> 37:36.645
Better?

37:42.798 --> 37:45.038
Where are they?
What did you do?

37:45.354 --> 37:46.324
Relax.

37:47.362 --> 37:49.344
They're on their way to the Rack.

37:50.185 --> 37:52.340
To meet you, actually.

37:53.183 --> 37:56.519
I may not be a genius, but I
know how to clone a cell phone.

37:56.742 --> 38:01.133
Speaking of, you've put me in
quite a bind with your little tricks.

38:01.527 --> 38:03.455
Latnok's gonna
think I failed them.

38:03.475 --> 38:05.960
Failed them?
Or failed her?

38:06.393 --> 38:08.994
- What?
- You know what I'm talking about.

38:10.858 --> 38:13.570
So you found out about my mum.

38:14.941 --> 38:15.883
You know,

38:16.543 --> 38:18.221
if she had her way,

38:18.241 --> 38:20.532
you wouldn't still be
living this life of yours.

38:20.663 --> 38:24.140
Latnok would have complete
control over you, and believe me,

38:24.273 --> 38:28.603
it's only a matter of time before she
figures out how to get what she wants.

38:29.182 --> 38:31.140
I was going to convince her
to let you go.

38:31.160 --> 38:33.542
Because I thought
you saved my life.

38:34.563 --> 38:37.609
Who knew what a clever
little liar you would be?

38:37.629 --> 38:38.774
I had no choice.

38:38.794 --> 38:41.985
We all have choices.
Like how I...

38:42.153 --> 38:44.425
am choosing to forgive you
for what you've done

38:44.445 --> 38:46.156
and give you a chance to fix it.

38:46.693 --> 38:48.710
Then no one need be any the wiser.

38:49.009 --> 38:51.643
Even if I knew how to do that,
I wouldn't.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.163
Oh, you know.

38:54.101 --> 38:57.334
It's all up there
in that head of yours.

38:58.776 --> 39:00.776
Forgot about that, didn't you?

39:02.045 --> 39:04.261
I can think of a few people
who probably haven't.

39:04.281 --> 39:07.075
See they went about it
the wrong way in the past.

39:07.797 --> 39:12.141
Anyone with a brain knows there's
only one way to get you to cooperate.

39:16.628 --> 39:19.505
You figured out what
I did to get rid of Sarah.

39:21.103 --> 39:23.777
So you know what I'm willing
to do to get what I want.

39:33.800 --> 39:36.518
We're okay. Nate's still out cold.

39:50.488 --> 39:53.913
That ring... looks a lot like
the one Kyle wears around his neck.

39:53.933 --> 39:55.661
Nate stole it from Cassidy.

39:57.478 --> 39:59.478
It belonged to my mother.

40:06.390 --> 40:08.447
So I guess you kind
of helped me find it.

40:08.957 --> 40:10.923
And you saved me, so...

40:11.541 --> 40:13.005
I guess we're even?

40:14.943 --> 40:18.756
Look, I know we've never
really gotten along, but...

40:19.859 --> 40:20.931
I don't know.

40:21.529 --> 40:24.540
I feel like we might be a
little bit closer than before.

40:26.507 --> 40:29.193
So I think it's only
fair that I tell you...

40:36.286 --> 40:37.626
Tell me what?

40:38.089 --> 40:40.439
I'm going to tell
Kyle I want him back.

40:46.239 --> 40:48.229
You really have
the nerve to say that?

40:48.940 --> 40:50.995
After everything
that happened tonight?

40:51.095 --> 40:53.325
Like I said, fair warning.

40:56.972 --> 40:58.126
You deserve it.

41:00.972 --> 41:03.038
You're a lot braver than I thought.

41:10.969 --> 41:11.980
Origin...?

41:13.382 --> 41:14.423
What is it?

41:17.808 --> 41:19.017
I don't believe it.

41:24.395 --> 41:26.406
You still wear Adam's Latnok ring.

41:27.004 --> 41:30.028
How awfully sentimental.
And lucky for me.

41:32.441 --> 41:36.369
- Why are you doing this?
- Because that is what they want.

41:37.163 --> 41:39.746
That's what she wants.

41:40.727 --> 41:42.707
And if you try to stop me,

41:42.875 --> 41:45.043
I'm just gonna have to keep
hurting you.

41:47.400 --> 41:48.400
And then,

41:48.905 --> 41:50.864
I'm gonna hurt Jessi...

41:52.468 --> 41:54.845
until she wishes
she had really died.

41:56.597 --> 41:57.659
And then,

41:58.599 --> 42:01.195
just when you think
it couldn't get any worse,

42:04.617 --> 42:07.858
I'll hurt everybody that
ever mattered to you.

42:10.111 --> 42:11.946
Starting with Amanda.

42:15.803 --> 42:17.813
How you feelin' about that, mate?

42:19.183 --> 42:21.049
<i>Nicole had been right when she said</i>

42:21.069 --> 42:23.677
<i>she didn't recognize
the person I had become.</i>

42:27.183 --> 42:29.084
<i>The person I had been before</i>

42:29.514 --> 42:31.333
<i>would have never done this...</i>

43:01.843 --> 43:04.301
- You won't do it.
- What makes you so sure?

43:05.409 --> 43:07.904
Because Grace Kingsley, my mother...

43:08.375 --> 43:09.828
What about her?

43:11.560 --> 43:13.421
She's your mother, too.

43:17.535 --> 43:19.206
I'm your brother.
