07:34.378 --> 07:35.545
Roberto!

07:38.090 --> 07:39.507
You promised.

07:43.929 --> 07:46.806
Adios, Kashkin.
Adios, Roberto.

08:33.854 --> 08:35.730
BUNKER

08:39.193 --> 08:41.402
Hola, Americano.

08:42.738 --> 08:44.823
Hola. Hola.

09:24.905 --> 09:27.615
Help yourself, Jordan.
General Golz?

09:28.576 --> 09:32.579
What an accent!
He even knows me in the dark!

09:33.038 --> 09:36.833
That's all we have
in Spain now ... accents.

09:37.293 --> 09:39.752
Eh, Jordan?
I was looking for you.

09:40.170 --> 09:43.965
I saw you.
How did it go with the train?

09:44.425 --> 09:45.592
Alright.

09:45.968 --> 09:49.053
And Kashkin?
He caught one.

09:50.973 --> 09:53.600
He didn't want to be taken alive.

09:54.643 --> 09:58.104
Oh, so it was like that?
Yes. Murder.

09:58.480 --> 10:02.317
Orders are orders.
I still call it murder. Well ...

10:02.693 --> 10:07.280
in this business, Jordan, remember
nothing. Nothing except the next job.

10:07.740 --> 10:11.075
What's next?
A bridge. Oh, a bridge. Right.

10:11.535 --> 10:16.873
To blow the bridge is nothing. But
to blow it at the time of the attack,

10:17.249 --> 10:21.711
that's a horse of another color, as you Americans say.
Attack?

10:22.171 --> 10:26.507
Yes. At last we take the offensive.
Oh, it will be a beautiful attack.

10:26.884 --> 10:30.303
On paper it looks wonderful,
and if it succeeds ...

10:30.721 --> 10:35.266
No, I will not say "if."
This time it must succeed and it will.

10:35.976 --> 10:40.772
What I've told you, Jordan,
is known only to the general staff.

10:41.190 --> 10:45.068
Our only chance to succeed
is by a surprise attack.

10:45.444 --> 10:48.905
Now, here is the bridge,
over a deep gorge.

10:49.365 --> 10:52.283
It's the only way
the enemy can bring up reinforcements.

10:52.660 --> 10:56.704
Tanks, artillery, troops,
all must come over this bridge.

10:57.081 --> 11:01.250
I must know it is gone. Not before
the attack, they'd rebuild it.

11:01.710 --> 11:06.506
It must go the minute the attack
starts, no sooner, no later.

11:06.966 --> 11:12.720
So the bridge is nothing. But suppose
their soldiers are sitting on it.

11:13.180 --> 11:16.307
You know, sentries on both ends.
What do you do then?

11:17.518 --> 11:23.106
In my country, they say, "Never blow
a bridge till you come to it."- Good.

11:23.565 --> 11:27.568
That's good, you joke. In this
business, one should joke a little.

11:28.028 --> 11:31.239
I am so serious.
It's why I can joke.

11:31.991 --> 11:35.034
You think you can get through enemy lines tomorrow night?
Sure.

11:35.411 --> 11:38.871
Good. That will give you 3 days
to prepare for the dynamiting.

11:39.331 --> 11:43.710
Wait for the attack at dawn,
after the third night.

11:44.086 --> 11:47.130
How will I know the exact time?
Well, use these.

11:47.589 --> 11:49.841
Listen. First we attack from the air.

11:50.217 --> 11:53.553
When you hear the explosions,
that's your time.

11:54.013 --> 11:58.516
I've got a good guide for you,
an old man named Anselmo.

11:58.976 --> 12:03.563
Knows the country like a fox,
and the people to help you.

12:03.981 --> 12:06.774
Now, go
and find yourself a pretty girl.

12:09.361 --> 12:12.280
But first get a haircut.
Is that an order, General?

12:12.740 --> 12:16.951
Why not?
I don't like your barber.

12:21.915 --> 12:25.293
Up the gorge to the left
is the bridge.

12:32.134 --> 12:34.969
Sentry boxes, huh?
At each end, Roberto.

12:35.429 --> 12:38.014
Always two sentries on guard.

12:38.432 --> 12:44.645
Where do the sentries live?
At the roadmender's hut, across the bridge.

12:45.105 --> 12:47.440
You can't see it from here.

12:47.858 --> 12:51.527
The other post is on this side,
in that old sawmill.

12:54.281 --> 12:57.241
How many men in the sawmill?
Eight, and a corporal.

12:57.701 --> 13:01.287
The other post, how many men?
Maybe more.

13:01.747 --> 13:03.956
We'll find out. Look!

13:12.382 --> 13:15.051
They always spit in the gorge.

13:15.469 --> 13:17.428
It brings luck.

13:19.223 --> 13:22.183
I wish I could spit that far.

13:33.070 --> 13:34.112
Roberto!

13:35.322 --> 13:38.658
That sentry, he looks
like a man from my village.

13:39.284 --> 13:41.828
He's very young.

13:46.125 --> 13:50.920
He must die?
You couldn't do it, Anselmo?

13:53.507 --> 13:59.303
I would kill the sentry, considering
the necessity of the bridge.

13:59.721 --> 14:04.350
But if I live later,
I'll try to live in such a way,

14:04.726 --> 14:09.939
doing no harm to anyone,
that it will be forgiven.

14:18.323 --> 14:20.992
Come on, let's get this dynamite
somewhere safe.

14:44.266 --> 14:47.768
You wait here, Roberto.
Oh, I can make it, Anselmo.

14:48.228 --> 14:52.315
You want to be shot at,
carrying these?

14:52.691 --> 14:55.067
No, not even in a joke.

14:56.111 --> 14:58.112
Go ahead.

15:10.375 --> 15:11.542
Roberto!

15:25.682 --> 15:30.186
He's the boss here, Roberto. Very strong man.
I can see.

15:30.646 --> 15:34.190
Foreigner?
And a friend. Didn't the old man tell you?

15:34.608 --> 15:36.692
I'm asking you.

15:41.865 --> 15:44.450
I'm here for the Republic.

15:50.707 --> 15:55.503
You know those seals, don't you?
SIM, Service of Military Intelligence.

15:55.963 --> 15:58.965
The General Staff
commands for the Republic.

15:59.341 --> 16:02.134
In these mountains, I command.
No one else.

16:08.225 --> 16:11.310
What's that?
Dynamite.

16:11.728 --> 16:14.897
Good. I can use dynamite.
How much you bring me?

16:15.315 --> 16:17.942
None. What's your name?

16:19.278 --> 16:22.738
What's that to you?
Pablo. He's Pablo.

16:23.156 --> 16:26.367
What for?
A bridge.

16:26.785 --> 16:29.328
What bridge?
That's my business.

16:29.705 --> 16:34.041
In this country, it's my business.
Don't talk so! You want to die?

16:34.501 --> 16:39.005
No! - Shut your mouth.
This comrade comes for the Republic!

16:39.464 --> 16:40.756
Anselmo!

16:41.133 --> 16:45.386
Help us get this stuff
up to your camp. The old man's tired.

17:26.762 --> 17:29.764
Hola! What is this that comes?

17:30.140 --> 17:33.434
The old man and a dynamiter.

17:42.444 --> 17:46.238
Hey, that stuff! Not in the cave.

17:57.918 --> 18:00.753
What're you making?
A trap for foxes.

18:01.171 --> 18:05.383
See? Very practical.
He catches rabbits.

18:06.051 --> 18:08.928
If a Gypsy catches rabbits,
he says it's foxes.

18:09.388 --> 18:13.682
If he catches a fox, it's an elephant.
And if I catch an elephant?

18:14.059 --> 18:16.936
You'd say it was a tank.

18:17.354 --> 18:20.314
I'll get me a tank, old man!

18:20.774 --> 18:24.527
Some day I'll get me one
and you can call it what you please.

18:24.986 --> 18:28.114
Gypsies talk much, kill little.

18:28.490 --> 18:31.492
I'm going for wine.
Bring a cup for me.

18:31.910 --> 18:34.578
You have wine, huh?
And plenty of it.

18:34.996 --> 18:39.792
We eat like generals here.
Yeah, he eats like ten generals.

18:40.210 --> 18:43.963
And what do Gypsies do in the war?
They keep on being Gypsies.

18:44.381 --> 18:47.466
That's a good job.
The best.

18:47.926 --> 18:51.178
How do they call you?
Roberto. And you?

18:51.555 --> 18:58.102
Rafael. Oh, wine!
There will be food soon.

18:58.520 --> 18:59.937
Food!

19:00.981 --> 19:03.399
Oh, you have tobacco!

19:19.416 --> 19:21.167
Yeah, I know these.

19:22.210 --> 19:25.337
Much air and little tobacco.

19:31.386 --> 19:34.430
Ah, we eat!

19:37.392 --> 19:38.559
Hola!

19:39.936 --> 19:41.145
Hola!

20:12.594 --> 20:14.220
That's how I comb it.

20:20.727 --> 20:23.103
Go ahead and eat.

20:26.399 --> 20:28.609
Hey, bread!

21:06.648 --> 21:08.482
How are you called?

21:08.858 --> 21:11.485
María. And you?

21:12.529 --> 21:13.696
Roberto.

21:17.909 --> 21:20.160
Been here long?

21:21.621 --> 21:23.247
This long.

21:24.291 --> 21:27.918
Three months.
They shaved my head in Valladolid.

21:28.378 --> 21:32.798
I was on the train heading south.
The train Pablo blew at Arévalo.

21:33.258 --> 21:36.552
Many of the prisoners were caught
again, but they saved me.

21:37.387 --> 21:43.058
They and Pilar.
We found her hiding in the rocks where she'd run off.

21:43.435 --> 21:46.145
You should have seen her!

21:46.938 --> 21:49.815
No hair at all.
Cried all the time.

21:50.275 --> 21:54.987
And if anyone touched her,
she'd shiver like a wet dog.

21:55.447 --> 21:58.949
Man, but she was ugly.
God's truth, Roberto.

21:59.409 --> 22:04.955
Though Gypsies usually lie.
She looked like a half-drowned kitten.

22:09.878 --> 22:12.588
You blow trains?
I have.

22:13.632 --> 22:16.925
Here?
No, in Extremadura.

22:25.185 --> 22:27.311
In another six months it'll grow out.

22:42.327 --> 22:45.829
Are you his woman?
Pablo's?

22:46.289 --> 22:49.124
You've seen Pablo!

22:49.584 --> 22:55.589
I've seen Rafael too.
No. No, not the Gypsy.

22:56.007 --> 23:00.302
This is a very strange woman.
Is of no one.

23:00.720 --> 23:03.013
But she cooks well.

23:05.475 --> 23:07.518
Really of no one?

23:12.607 --> 23:14.024
No one.

23:15.610 --> 23:17.069
Nor of you, either.

23:19.823 --> 23:21.031
No.

23:21.825 --> 23:24.576
No. I have no time for women.

23:26.663 --> 23:27.996
No?

23:33.586 --> 23:35.295
María!

23:45.932 --> 23:47.558
Who's that?

23:50.019 --> 23:52.354
Pablo's woman, Pilar.

23:52.772 --> 23:56.442
She's something barbarous!
But brave!

23:56.818 --> 23:59.903
A hundred times braver than Pablo.
Pablo was brave in the beginning.

24:00.363 --> 24:02.740
He killed more people than cholera.

24:03.116 --> 24:06.869
Yes, at the start he kill more people
than the bubonic plague.

24:07.245 --> 24:11.123
But, Pilar,
she is something barbarous!

24:11.541 --> 24:17.171
The Gypsy's afraid of her.
Why not? She hates me.

24:17.547 --> 24:20.466
Why?
She treats me as a time waster.

24:20.842 --> 24:23.635
She doesn't like Gypsies.
What an injustice!

24:24.053 --> 24:29.141
She has Gypsy blood herself.
She knows of what she speaks.

24:29.601 --> 24:35.105
But she has a tongue.
It bites like a bull whip.

24:35.482 --> 24:40.319
What are you saying now, you lazy son
of an unmentionable Gypsy?

24:40.737 --> 24:42.112
Answer me, Gypsy!

24:42.489 --> 24:47.743
I was telling this comrade
what a kind woman you are, Pilar.

24:48.203 --> 24:52.456
Liar!
This one comes as a dynamiter. I know that.

24:52.832 --> 24:55.793
Go and relieve Andrés.
He's on guard at the top.

24:56.169 --> 24:58.837
I go, Pilar.
I'll see you, Roberto,

24:59.214 --> 25:03.008
when we eat.
Not even in a joke! 3 times today you've eaten.

25:03.384 --> 25:08.889
But I can eat twice more.
Get out of here! And send me Andrés!

25:11.518 --> 25:13.060
Hola, Inglés.

25:13.520 --> 25:15.896
How are you and the Republic?
Good.

25:16.356 --> 25:19.650
Both good.
I'm happy.

25:20.026 --> 25:24.363
What did that Gypsy say about me?
He said you were much woman.

25:24.823 --> 25:27.115
And I'd say he's right.

25:28.952 --> 25:32.538
And what did you say to the girl, before I came out?
Nothing.

25:32.956 --> 25:37.793
I saw how she was from seeing you.
I only joked with her. Jokes?

25:38.253 --> 25:42.631
Listen to me, Inglés.
She's young, not hardened as we are.

25:43.007 --> 25:47.010
And she's had a bad time.
You understand?

25:47.387 --> 25:51.056
Yes, I guess so.
I'm worried about her.

25:51.432 --> 25:55.519
When do you leave here?
In three days. If I'm still alive.

25:55.979 --> 26:00.065
What made you say that?
That never brings luck.

26:00.525 --> 26:02.693
Let me see your hand.

26:05.613 --> 26:08.907
Well?
Nothing.

26:09.284 --> 26:13.871
I saw nothing. What do you come for?
Blow another train?

26:14.247 --> 26:16.623
No, a bridge.
All the better.

26:17.083 --> 26:19.960
Now we have horses.
Let's blow all the bridges and go!

26:20.378 --> 26:24.214
I'm sick of this place. We are rotting
here because there's no fighting.

26:24.591 --> 26:29.636
Only watching Pablo get drunk.
This life is ruining him.

26:30.013 --> 26:33.140
What did you see in my hand?
I saw nothing.

26:33.600 --> 26:35.017
Yes, you did.

26:36.227 --> 26:41.106
I'm only curious. I don't believe in it.
In what do you believe?

26:41.482 --> 26:44.860
In my work.
I saw that. What else?

26:45.320 --> 26:46.486
Nothing else.

26:47.530 --> 26:50.866
The bridge is very difficult?
No. It is important.

26:51.326 --> 26:53.577
But it can be very difficult?
Yes.

26:54.454 --> 26:57.581
I'm going to look it over again.
How many men have you got here?

26:57.957 --> 27:02.210
Five. The Gypsy is worthless,
although his intentions are good.

27:02.629 --> 27:05.881
Pablo, I no longer trust.

27:08.092 --> 27:13.805
Thanks. I like your way of speaking.
I try to speak frankly.

27:14.265 --> 27:17.476
Then tell me what you saw in my hand.
No.

27:18.436 --> 27:20.896
I saw nothing else.

27:22.148 --> 27:26.526
Go now to the bridge.
I look after your equipment.

27:26.986 --> 27:31.114
Let me tell you again, Inglés.
I'm glad you've come.

27:31.491 --> 27:34.159
We will understand each other.

28:35.805 --> 28:38.473
Can they not dwell outside?

28:42.395 --> 28:45.480
I don't want dynamite in here.
We have fire.

28:46.190 --> 28:48.483
It's far from the fire.

28:51.612 --> 28:52.779
Smoke?

29:16.846 --> 29:19.222
How goes the Gypsy?

29:19.682 --> 29:22.142
Is she going to let you eat again?
Why not?

29:26.064 --> 29:31.109
Is there wine?
Not much left.

29:33.279 --> 29:36.031
Then I'll have some water.

29:38.117 --> 29:40.786
María, is there any water left?

30:03.392 --> 30:06.478
It's too strong,
or I'd give you some.

30:06.854 --> 30:09.231
I'd offer it to you, Pablo,
but there's not much left.

30:11.317 --> 30:14.236
I have wine.
What drink is it?

30:14.695 --> 30:17.489
Medicine, you wanna taste it?

30:17.949 --> 30:19.908
What's it for?

30:20.284 --> 30:23.370
It changes your ideas.
Yeah?

30:30.670 --> 30:34.840
Bitter as gall! I'd rather be sick
than have the medicine.

30:35.216 --> 30:39.261
That's the wormwood.
I'm glad you don't like it.

30:40.888 --> 30:43.140
What are you saying there?

30:44.350 --> 30:48.353
I was explaining the medicine.
María!

30:54.277 --> 30:58.530
What's that?
The bridge showing the construction.

30:58.906 --> 31:00.907
Look how it seems.

31:02.118 --> 31:05.453
Why, it's the bridge itself!

31:06.164 --> 31:09.374
How do you blow a bridge?
That's what I'm figuring out.

31:09.834 --> 31:10.959
No!

31:12.378 --> 31:17.549
I don't go for the bridge.
Neither me nor my people.

31:19.927 --> 31:23.138
Then we'll do it alone. Old one?
Yes.

31:23.598 --> 31:27.642
Without this coward.
Hey, you! What did you say?

31:28.019 --> 31:31.062
Nothing for you. I spoke to Roberto.

31:44.035 --> 31:48.038
My orders are to blow the bridge.
And I say no!

31:48.497 --> 31:50.624
In these mountains we hide.

31:51.334 --> 31:57.130
I take care of my people.
Live one place, fight somewhere else.

31:57.506 --> 32:00.926
Fight, raid, blow trains, bridges,
but way off.

32:02.220 --> 32:07.057
Not here where they will hunt us.
You'll clear out. You've got horses.

32:09.185 --> 32:12.229
I have 5 horses and 8 people.

32:12.688 --> 32:16.650
You and the old man
with the loud mouth make ten.

32:17.735 --> 32:22.364
Now if this bridge is blown,
we will be hunted.

32:22.823 --> 32:26.409
Hunted from the earth, from the air.

32:27.912 --> 32:31.915
The explosions will fall
from the sky on my horses.

32:32.375 --> 32:35.794
Until you had horses,
you were one of us.

32:36.212 --> 32:39.005
Now you're rich with horses,
you want to retire.

32:39.423 --> 32:43.093
A lie! You know
I expose the horses for the cause.

32:43.469 --> 32:46.721
To eat well, yes.
To steal, yes.

32:47.181 --> 32:50.767
To murder, yes.
To fight for the Republic, no!

32:51.227 --> 32:53.937
You are an old man
who will make trouble with his mouth.

32:54.397 --> 32:59.484
I am an old man not afraid to fight.
I'm an old man without horses.

32:59.860 --> 33:02.320
You might not live long.

33:02.780 --> 33:06.074
I'm an old man
who will live until I die.

33:10.162 --> 33:12.247
You will blow no bridge here!

33:14.125 --> 33:16.209
No?
No.

33:16.585 --> 33:18.295
No bridge.

33:20.715 --> 33:21.756
Pilar!

33:23.050 --> 33:27.595
What do you say?
I am for the bridge.

33:28.222 --> 33:31.850
And for the Republic.
What's that, woman?

33:35.146 --> 33:39.399
I am for the bridge and against you.
Nothing more.

33:40.651 --> 33:44.988
What do you say, Primitivo?
I am also for the bridge.

33:45.656 --> 33:46.698
Fernando?

33:47.074 --> 33:51.911
To me the bridge means nothing.
I'm for the woman of Pablo.

33:52.955 --> 33:55.206
Andrés!
Yes, equally!

33:58.753 --> 34:01.046
The same, Pilar.

34:01.756 --> 34:05.467
Then we blow the bridge
and retreat to the Gredos afterwards.

34:05.885 --> 34:09.387
You with your head of a bull
and heart of a hawk!

34:09.764 --> 34:12.806
You think there'll be
any "afterwards", from this bridge?

34:13.225 --> 34:15.935
I am for the Republic
and the Republic is the bridge!

34:16.353 --> 34:20.065
It means nothing
to be hunted like a beast

34:20.440 --> 34:23.902
after this thing
which brings no profit?

34:25.071 --> 34:27.405
Nor even to die for it?

34:27.822 --> 34:30.992
Don't try to frighten us, coward!

34:31.994 --> 34:35.955
Coward?
Is it cowardly to know what's foolish?

34:36.415 --> 34:41.335
Or am I a leader for nothing?
Haven't I gotten you this far alive?

34:41.795 --> 34:47.384
This foreigner comes to do a thing
for the good of the foreigners.

34:47.842 --> 34:50.053
For his goal you want to sacrifice us!

34:50.429 --> 34:55.225
I'm for the good and safety of all.
Safety!

34:55.601 --> 34:57.435
There is no such thing.

34:57.812 --> 35:04.150
Did I spend 9 years with matadors
not to learn about fear and safety?

35:04.610 --> 35:07.862
Speak to me of anything but safety!

35:08.239 --> 35:11.825
Look at him.
How I believed in him once.

35:12.201 --> 35:17.622
And look what he is now.
From a year of war you've become lazy,

35:18.082 --> 35:20.500
a drunkard and a coward.
Woman!

35:20.876 --> 35:25.755
You have no right to speak like that.
Not before my people and a stranger.

35:26.173 --> 35:30.093
Do you still believe
you command here?

35:31.178 --> 35:32.429
Yes.

35:33.055 --> 35:37.225
Here I command!
Here I command!

35:37.643 --> 35:42.939
Haven't you heard them?
Here no one commands but me now.

35:43.983 --> 35:47.485
I should shoot you
and the foreigner both.

35:50.156 --> 35:53.032
Try it and see what happens.

35:53.492 --> 35:58.246
Listen to me, drunkard!
You understand now who commands?

35:58.706 --> 36:02.667
Why, I command!
No! Listen!

36:03.127 --> 36:05.628
Take the wax from your ears.

36:06.088 --> 36:08.173
Listen well.

36:08.549 --> 36:11.468
I command.

36:23.772 --> 36:25.231
Alright.

36:26.233 --> 36:28.526
You command.

36:33.699 --> 36:37.577
And if you want,
he can command too.

36:39.246 --> 36:42.916
Maybe I am lazy
and drink too much.

36:43.292 --> 36:48.087
Maybe you think I'm a coward,
though you know better.

36:48.464 --> 36:50.089
Maybe.

36:50.466 --> 36:53.343
But I'm not stupid.

36:56.472 --> 37:01.684
Now if you're a woman as well as
a commander, show us something to eat.

37:02.728 --> 37:03.978
María!

37:08.609 --> 37:11.152
Take the food.

37:42.518 --> 37:46.646
You must be careful.
Pablo? If you sleep, yes.

37:48.816 --> 37:51.109
I'll watch out. What's he doing?

37:51.569 --> 37:55.655
Only drinking. There will be danger
if he begins to hide the sadness.

37:59.285 --> 38:02.412
If he pretends to be friendly,
then he's made a decision.

38:02.871 --> 38:06.040
I heard Pilar say it.
What kind of decision?

38:06.417 --> 38:10.211
Who knows? After what's happened,
it'd mean danger for you.

38:11.547 --> 38:15.592
I'll look after myself.
I'm thinking about the bridge.

38:16.594 --> 38:19.137
I'm thinking about you, Roberto.

38:21.348 --> 38:22.473
Why, María?

38:25.686 --> 38:28.313
Well, I don't know.

39:43.180 --> 39:45.598
Did I muss it?

39:47.434 --> 39:50.436
All day I wanted you to do that.

39:51.438 --> 39:53.356
I too, María.

40:20.384 --> 40:22.093
Where's Pablo?

40:23.470 --> 40:28.766
Ah, he's gone to the horses.
Now you have to kill him.

40:29.226 --> 40:32.854
Kill him before he kills you.
He won't kill me.

40:33.313 --> 40:36.691
We waited for you to kill him.
Why didn't you?

40:37.109 --> 40:40.862
And turn Pilar against me?
She's in control here.

40:41.238 --> 40:45.199
So, he takes the horses and goes.
What about your bridge then?

40:46.285 --> 40:48.536
You don't know Pablo.

40:52.166 --> 40:55.626
Now men,
you have tightened your garters.

41:55.437 --> 41:56.813
You, my friend,

41:57.272 --> 42:01.359
you know I'm not a coward.

42:01.902 --> 42:05.321
You are no woman, no fool.

42:08.909 --> 42:12.286
Nor any colt of a girl either

42:12.746 --> 42:15.915
that makes a man crazy with hunger.

42:16.291 --> 42:21.796
You don't lie, make insults,
and leave me, like my people.

42:22.840 --> 42:27.677
Yes, eat, my friend.

42:28.512 --> 42:33.349
Pay no attention to the woman.
You know who commands.

42:34.393 --> 42:35.643
You and me,

42:36.228 --> 42:42.733
we'll show them who's stupid.
Not me, not you, my friend.

43:13.473 --> 43:14.932
Get out of sight!

43:24.359 --> 43:27.570
Ours?
German and Italian.

43:28.614 --> 43:31.324
Can they see the horses?
They're not looking for horses.

43:31.700 --> 43:35.745
Man! I could see their faces!
I spit in their faces!

43:36.163 --> 43:38.831
I spit in the milk of their mothers!

43:39.249 --> 43:44.295
I tell you they could see the horses.
Wipe the sweat from your face.

43:44.755 --> 43:48.007
They could see the cigarette butts.
Huh?

43:50.302 --> 43:53.888
Hey, wait! They may be back!
Coward!

43:54.348 --> 43:56.223
Go to your horses!

43:56.600 --> 44:01.771
Have you seen planes like this before?
Never, Inglés. Get inside.

44:06.151 --> 44:10.529
I'm going with Pilar to El Sordo.
We've got to have more horses.

44:10.989 --> 44:14.325
You know your sentry posts.
Keep a close watch.

44:14.743 --> 44:20.289
Anselmo, write down everything
that passes along the road.

44:21.416 --> 44:25.836
I can't write, Roberto.
I'll show you how to write.

44:26.254 --> 44:29.256
Look how Roberto can make pictures.

44:30.133 --> 44:32.802
That's a truck, see?

44:33.178 --> 44:36.472
And here's a soldier on a horse.

44:37.641 --> 44:40.226
Look! Tank!

44:42.604 --> 44:47.400
I will catch me
a tank like that, old man.

44:52.239 --> 44:56.200
Whatever passes, make a mark.
The man on the horse is for cavalry.

44:56.660 --> 45:00.454
Each mark means a troop
of twenty mounted men. Understand?

45:00.914 --> 45:06.711
Each troop a mark.
In this way I can write, yes.

45:07.170 --> 45:10.006
That's an educated pencil.

45:10.799 --> 45:14.135
Use one paper for each direction.

45:14.594 --> 45:17.471
Tonight I'll know then
what they're moving up to the front.

45:17.889 --> 45:21.183
Better get along,
and take some food with you.

45:22.644 --> 45:24.854
Can I write too?

45:25.772 --> 45:29.025
Watch the bridge and sentry posts.
See if more soldiers are brought,

45:29.401 --> 45:32.737
and at what intervals
the guard is changed.

45:33.196 --> 45:36.240
What is "intervals"?

45:36.658 --> 45:40.995
How many hours
the sentries stay on and when they go.

45:42.039 --> 45:44.957
Without a watch?
Take mine.

45:47.461 --> 45:52.631
What a watch!
Look at what a complication.

45:53.091 --> 45:56.010
It should be able to read and write.
Don't fool with it.

45:56.428 --> 46:01.223
Can you tell time?
Why not? 12 o'clock day ... hunger.

46:01.641 --> 46:05.144
6 o'clock night ... drunk.
With luck.

46:06.688 --> 46:11.317
Ten o'clock now.
You don't need to be a clown.

46:11.777 --> 46:15.029
Do what I tell you
and keep out of sight.

46:16.573 --> 46:20.326
Salud, Gypsy. Did you see the air machines?
See them?

46:20.702 --> 46:23.621
We ate them for breakfast!

46:24.039 --> 46:27.541
Is there food, Pilar? I'm hungry.

46:27.918 --> 46:30.878
It's a long walk from La Granja.

46:33.465 --> 46:37.384
La Granja?
Yes, Roberto. You wish tobacco?

46:37.844 --> 46:40.763
You?
Didn't you sleep here last night?

46:41.223 --> 46:45.309
For a while, yes. Then I thought
of my woman and children in La Granja.

46:45.685 --> 46:48.646
Then I went there.
Wasn't that dangerous?

46:49.856 --> 46:54.777
You have to get past their sentries.
That's why I only go at night.

46:55.153 --> 46:57.613
Oh, María!

47:00.700 --> 47:04.245
See much movement on the road?
Nothing.

47:04.663 --> 47:08.833
A few trucks as usual. Cars.
A few guns, as usual.

47:09.292 --> 47:12.419
No troops.
Pick up any news in town?

47:12.796 --> 47:14.839
But nothing.

47:17.425 --> 47:21.637
Still goes battle in the north.
That's not news.

47:22.013 --> 47:26.559
Oh, yes ... there is talk
of the Republic preparing an attack.

47:27.602 --> 47:30.771
What?
That we are preparing an offensive.

47:32.399 --> 47:33.440
Where?

47:33.817 --> 47:36.485
Perhaps here or near Navacerrada.

47:36.862 --> 47:39.738
Have you heard of it?
Who told you that?

47:40.157 --> 47:43.909
Who?
Surely you know how rumors fly?

47:44.327 --> 47:49.039
The officers talks in the cafes
and the waiters listen.

47:49.916 --> 47:53.127
They say this is
an offensive of some size, but ...

47:53.503 --> 47:55.504
it's only a rumor.

47:57.257 --> 47:58.591
What else did you hear?

47:59.593 --> 48:01.427
Nothing, man.

48:04.055 --> 48:09.935
There is some talk of the Republicans
wanting to blow the bridges, but ...

48:10.979 --> 48:15.107
Are you joking?
This one doesn't joke, Inglés.

48:15.483 --> 48:17.860
Bad luck he doesn't.

48:18.445 --> 48:21.989
A man like me
is never alarmed by rumors, Pilar.

48:22.407 --> 48:24.867
Remember anything more?
No.

48:25.911 --> 48:30.706
They talk as usual of soldiers to be
sent to clear us out of the mountains.

48:31.082 --> 48:34.251
There is some talk troops are
on the way. But it's always like that.

48:34.711 --> 48:39.757
It's not important.
Only rumors as usual.

48:40.175 --> 48:42.760
Rumors! Everything as usual!

48:43.220 --> 48:45.387
Things are bad in the north,
as usual!

48:45.805 --> 48:49.266
That troops come
to hunt us out, as usual!

48:49.643 --> 48:52.061
An offensive here, as usual!

48:52.520 --> 48:56.065
Man, you are a monument
to "as usual".

48:56.524 --> 48:58.943
But the last two, Pilar,
are only rumors.

48:59.361 --> 49:02.446
My mother!
Let's go, Pilar.

49:04.074 --> 49:07.284
Who'll look after my things?
The man of rumors.

49:07.702 --> 49:11.288
Fernando, guard the explosives.
Very well, Pilar.

49:11.665 --> 49:16.627
Calm yourself. There is nothing
to worry about. Only rumors.

49:51.371 --> 49:52.538
Wait!

49:58.295 --> 50:00.129
Hello, María.

50:01.506 --> 50:03.340
Hello, Roberto.

50:04.968 --> 50:06.260
Inglés!

50:12.934 --> 50:14.727
Hola, Pilar!
Hola!

50:17.147 --> 50:21.066
Joaquín!
María! Tell Sordo I'm coming with Inglés!

50:21.943 --> 50:25.571
A good boy, Inglés.
El Sordo saved him

50:25.989 --> 50:30.993
when his family was killed,
and now they are like father and son.

50:33.079 --> 50:37.624
Inglés, tell me,
have you known many women?

50:38.668 --> 50:42.004
They meant nothing.
I think you lie.

50:42.380 --> 50:47.092
Well, maybe ... a little.
And for this one, for María,

50:47.469 --> 50:50.721
you care much?
Let's get on.

51:01.191 --> 51:06.070
What is the reason for the bridge,
Inglés? Will there be an attack?

51:08.114 --> 51:11.992
And the airplanes this morning?
Does that mean the enemy's found out?

51:12.410 --> 51:14.703
They're preparing a counterattack?

51:15.163 --> 51:18.749
I only know one thing for certain.
What? You have to shout.

51:19.167 --> 51:23.337
One thing is certain. The bridge
must go when the attack starts.

51:23.797 --> 51:27.341
And to do that we've got to have
more horses and more men.

51:29.594 --> 51:31.387
When do we blow it?

51:33.390 --> 51:34.890
Day after tomorrow!

51:35.475 --> 51:38.018
Why not tonight?

51:38.478 --> 51:39.603
Orders.

51:43.066 --> 51:45.984
How do you get whiskey?
Make it!

51:46.736 --> 51:49.321
No, I joke.

51:49.739 --> 51:53.742
This is good whiskey,
we got it on a raid.

51:54.202 --> 51:58.288
No ice. Plenty ice up there.

51:59.332 --> 52:00.874
Too far.

52:07.966 --> 52:11.427
Easier blow the bridge tonight.
I'd be shot for it.

52:11.886 --> 52:13.679
Do it in daylight, we'll all be shot.

52:14.139 --> 52:18.142
Not if we have horses.
Hmm? Not if we have enough horses.

52:18.518 --> 52:20.936
We'll be out of here before they come.

52:21.396 --> 52:24.940
I have five horses and four men.

52:25.400 --> 52:31.155
Five men, Sordo.
So it is. Five with the boy.

52:31.614 --> 52:33.782
Five men and five horses.

52:34.159 --> 52:38.954
That's ten horses for 15 people.
We've got to have five more horses.

52:39.330 --> 52:42.416
For the retreat, yes.
Otherwise we won't make it.

52:42.792 --> 52:46.378
How can you get horses?
Steal 'em.

52:46.754 --> 52:52.259
Only soldiers have horses now.
Soldiers and thieves like us.

52:52.719 --> 52:57.514
Can you get five more tonight?
What? Tonight!

52:57.974 --> 53:01.226
We can try.
Good.

53:02.437 --> 53:06.565
Maybe not so good.
Not good if it snows.

53:07.025 --> 53:09.776
Horses make tracks
and soldiers follow tracks.

53:10.236 --> 53:14.114
It is too late for snow, Sordo.
Hmm? It's the month of May!

53:14.574 --> 53:16.992
And the sun is shining.

53:17.452 --> 53:23.290
Look at the young general.
Already he's stealing horses.

53:23.750 --> 53:27.794
He's always talking, Pilar, how
he carried the girl from the train.

53:28.254 --> 53:31.298
Let's see
you carry her down the hill, my boy.

53:31.674 --> 53:33.300
Now you make fun of me.

53:37.680 --> 53:41.141
Wait, Joaquín!
I'll carry you on my shoulders.

53:47.232 --> 53:48.732
Look, Inglés!

53:49.150 --> 53:52.444
Look at the bullfighter.
He's crying.

53:53.196 --> 53:55.864
Don't mock, Pilar.
He was telling me about his sister.

53:56.324 --> 53:59.952
She was a prisoner as I was,
and he just heard that she's dead.

54:01.955 --> 54:04.873
I'm your sister now, Joaquín.

54:05.291 --> 54:09.086
We all love you. We are your family.
Yes.

54:09.504 --> 54:13.423
Including the Inglés. Is that right?
Of course.

54:13.883 --> 54:17.094
You hear that, boy?
The Inglés is your brother.

54:17.470 --> 54:20.889
We're all brothers, Joaquín.
Thank you, Inglés.

54:21.349 --> 54:24.268
Don't worry.
I'll get you a horse tonight.

54:24.644 --> 54:28.230
One for María too.
What about me?

54:28.690 --> 54:34.027
Do I have to kiss you too? It's been
years since I kissed a bullfighter.

54:34.445 --> 54:38.198
Hold this, Inglés,
till I get a good kiss at him.

54:39.242 --> 54:42.786
Look at him! He's afraid of a kiss
as he was afraid of the bulls!

54:43.246 --> 54:45.080
No need to joke.

54:45.498 --> 54:49.793
When I kiss, it won't be as a sister.
This trick of kissing as a sister!

54:50.253 --> 54:52.546
Don't be so brutal, Pilar!

54:52.922 --> 54:55.591
I love you very much,
but why do you speak so brutally?

54:55.967 --> 54:58.385
Why do you think, girl?

55:05.977 --> 55:10.939
Rest, Pilar! You are tired.
Shut up! Nobody asked your advice!

55:11.399 --> 55:13.984
You think I'm an old woman.

55:15.612 --> 55:17.279
Sit down.

55:22.994 --> 55:25.120
Many things tire me.

55:27.707 --> 55:31.376
And one of them
is to be old and ugly.

55:32.420 --> 55:36.798
And another is to see a boy panic
when I joke that I might kiss him.

55:37.258 --> 55:43.513
It's not true. You didn't see that.
What d' you know , with your face?

55:43.890 --> 55:47.059
I have an evil temper today,
and I'm jealous.

55:47.477 --> 55:49.770
How foolish.

55:50.813 --> 55:54.274
I'm an ugly old woman,
and I love you very much, child.

55:55.276 --> 55:57.152
I love you too. You're not ugly.

55:57.528 --> 56:01.615
Go on, I'm not ugly!
I was born ugly.

56:03.368 --> 56:06.036
Do you know how an ugly woman feels?

56:06.496 --> 56:09.373
Do you know what it is
to be ugly all your life

56:09.832 --> 56:12.959
and feel beautiful in here?
You are beautiful.

56:13.336 --> 56:16.963
Try to use your head
and not your heart, and listen.

56:17.340 --> 56:21.176
I'm telling you things of much
interest. Does it interest you?

56:22.095 --> 56:25.597
María's right.
Two of a kind!

56:25.973 --> 56:31.103
You are a prize for any woman.
If you'd ever let go of yourself.

56:31.562 --> 56:33.480
And this one ...

56:34.357 --> 56:39.486
this one is a gift to any man,
if she could cook a little better.

56:41.447 --> 56:44.074
Give me a cigarette and listen.

56:44.450 --> 56:47.202
Life is very curious.

56:48.788 --> 56:55.127
I would have made a good man,
but I'm all woman and all ugly.

56:55.586 --> 57:00.257
Yet many men have loved me.
Is that strange?

57:00.717 --> 57:03.885
I don't think you're ugly.

57:04.929 --> 57:09.725
Don't lie to me.
Or has it begun to work with you too?

57:11.728 --> 57:14.938
No, no, no. Look, I am ugly.

57:16.065 --> 57:20.694
Yet one can have a feeling here
that blinds a man while he loves you.

57:21.738 --> 57:26.116
He thinks you are beautiful,
and one day, for no reason at all,

57:26.534 --> 57:32.330
he sees you ugly, as you really are.
And he's not blind any more.

57:34.083 --> 57:37.127
Then you see yourself
as ugly as he sees you.

57:37.587 --> 57:40.714
And you lose your man
and your feeling.

57:43.885 --> 57:46.386
Then one day the feeling,

57:46.846 --> 57:52.184
that idiotic feeling that you are
beautiful, grows inside of you again.

57:53.144 --> 57:57.647
And another man sees you
and thinks you're beautiful.

57:58.024 --> 58:01.067
And it's all to do over again.

58:04.655 --> 58:10.160
Now I am past it.
But it still might come again.

58:12.246 --> 58:14.664
Lift your head,
this silliness is over.

58:15.124 --> 58:20.045
I was only jealous of your 19 years.
It isn't a jealously that lasts.

58:20.505 --> 58:22.881
You won't be 19 always.

58:25.176 --> 58:28.929
You see,
I have evil thoughts, Inglés.

58:29.555 --> 58:34.851
If I were 19, I'd take you away
from this cropped head,

58:35.228 --> 58:38.104
even with my ugly face.

58:42.068 --> 58:46.029
No, no, sit there. I have a surprise
for you. Close your eyes.

58:46.489 --> 58:51.618
You too, Inglés.
No, tightly, both of you.

59:06.592 --> 59:09.594
Pilar, wait!
Shut up, Inglés!

59:10.012 --> 59:13.765
I'm bored with both of you!
Pilar!

59:16.519 --> 59:19.813
Let her go, Roberto.

59:29.740 --> 59:33.034
Don't you want to be alone with me?
Of course.

59:34.912 --> 59:37.747
And I want to be with you, Roberto.

59:38.958 --> 59:43.128
Pilar knows it. She knows everything.
I'm beginning to believe it.

59:43.588 --> 59:47.132
Will she be alright?
You don't have to worry about her.

59:52.805 --> 59:56.558
It's a wonderful day, Roberto.

59:57.476 --> 01:00:01.396
What are you worrying about?
About you.

01:00:01.772 --> 01:00:05.901
Me? Why?
Because I'm so happy?

01:00:06.944 --> 01:00:10.071
I wish you weren't here, María.

01:00:11.532 --> 01:00:12.741
I mean it.

01:00:14.076 --> 01:00:16.828
I'm thinking about what will
happen to you after the bridge.

01:00:18.873 --> 01:00:21.499
Can't I go with you?

01:00:23.961 --> 01:00:29.215
El Sordo will get us horses for sure.
I know we need them for the escape.

01:00:29.675 --> 01:00:33.595
You've got to understand, María.
I'm in this war to the finish.

01:00:34.013 --> 01:00:36.723
I can't have
anything serious in my life.

01:00:37.141 --> 01:00:40.310
A man doing what I'm doing
never knows what's going to happen.

01:00:40.728 --> 01:00:43.521
Whatever happens to you
will happen to me.

01:00:46.275 --> 01:00:48.652
Haven't you anyone in the Republic?

01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:51.821
No relatives all?
You must have people somewhere.

01:00:53.491 --> 01:00:57.494
My father and my mother,
I saw them killed.

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:05.168
My father was the mayor of our town
and a Republican.

01:01:05.544 --> 01:01:10.382
When the Nationalists came, they lined
up the Republicans against the wall.

01:01:11.342 --> 01:01:15.095
My father cried out very loud,
"Long live the Republic!"

01:01:15.554 --> 01:01:17.013
And then they shot him.

01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:22.602
But my mother was not a Republican.
She had no politics.

01:01:23.354 --> 01:01:26.606
But she loved my father
and she couldn't say that.

01:01:27.066 --> 01:01:33.446
So she just looked at my father
who lay there at her feet, and said,

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:37.492
"Long live my husband
who was the mayor of this town."

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:44.290
She said it very loud,
like a shriek,

01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:48.795
and then they shot and she fell,
and I wanted to got to her,

01:01:49.171 --> 01:01:54.759
but we were all tied by the wrists
in a long line of girls and women.

01:01:55.219 --> 01:01:57.804
And I wanted to be shot too
and say, "Long live the Republic

01:01:58.264 --> 01:02:00.765
and my mother and my father."

01:02:04.603 --> 01:02:07.188
Instead, there was no more shooting.

01:02:08.315 --> 01:02:13.945
They herded us up the hill
and through the streets

01:02:14.321 --> 01:02:16.448
to the square.

01:02:19.702 --> 01:02:24.122
My father's office
was in the city hall,

01:02:26.667 --> 01:02:31.504
but they took us
across the street to the barber shop.

01:02:32.548 --> 01:02:35.633
I want to tell you.
No. Don't.

01:02:58.949 --> 01:03:00.200
Roberto ...

01:03:01.702 --> 01:03:03.203
are you angry about something?

01:03:04.455 --> 01:03:06.289
Of course not.

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:11.252
I'm glad.

01:03:13.631 --> 01:03:16.257
I won't cry any more.

01:03:21.555 --> 01:03:23.389
Oh Roberto ...

01:03:24.809 --> 01:03:26.142
I like ...

01:03:26.602 --> 01:03:30.105
I don't know how to kiss
or I would kiss you.

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:36.611
Where do the noses go?

01:03:38.656 --> 01:03:41.950
Always I've wondered
where the noses would go.

01:03:45.746 --> 01:03:48.206
They're not in the way, are they?

01:03:48.666 --> 01:03:50.959
I always thought they would be.

01:03:52.002 --> 01:03:55.421
Look, I can do it myself.
María.

01:03:56.590 --> 01:03:58.925
Did I do it wrong?

01:04:21.407 --> 01:04:23.324
Look, Pilar!

01:04:23.742 --> 01:04:26.578
Roberto fell in the brook.

01:04:29.248 --> 01:04:31.916
Already she makes you blind, Inglés?

01:04:41.343 --> 01:04:43.928
Can't even see where you're going.

01:04:50.811 --> 01:04:55.273
Hola, Inglés.
Come sit down here where it's warm.

01:05:03.574 --> 01:05:07.493
I'll take your shoes and put them
in the smoke of the fire to dry.

01:05:22.176 --> 01:05:25.845
Hey, don't burn them. I don't want
to stand around here barefooted.

01:05:30.809 --> 01:05:35.980
María, fetch me some dry socks.
The lord and master.

01:05:37.316 --> 01:05:40.526
Here's the key.
The pack is locked.

01:05:40.945 --> 01:05:43.571
Who's on guard at the top?
Agustín.

01:05:45.741 --> 01:05:48.368
Put these on. Dry your feet well.

01:05:50.871 --> 01:05:53.998
You can't dry them with your hair?

01:05:54.416 --> 01:05:57.001
What a swine.

01:05:57.378 --> 01:06:00.004
Hit him with a chunk of wood, María.

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:03.716
I'm joking because I'm happy.
You are happy?

01:06:04.176 --> 01:06:06.970
Yes. I think everything goes well.

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:14.477
Keep this under your feet
until your shoes are dry.

01:06:14.853 --> 01:06:20.316
Must you care for him as a child?
No. As a man who's cold and wet.

01:06:20.776 --> 01:06:24.070
And a man
who has just come home to his house.

01:06:25.114 --> 01:06:28.074
Take the coffee, worthless one.

01:06:30.452 --> 01:06:34.914
Does it always grow dark this early?
No, Inglés. It's the weather.

01:06:35.374 --> 01:06:39.002
The wind is very disorderly.
Getting colder out.

01:06:39.461 --> 01:06:44.007
Yes, Inglés. It is not correct
to be so cold in the month of May.

01:06:46.552 --> 01:06:49.470
Any movement on the road, Anselmo?
Not much.

01:06:49.930 --> 01:06:54.684
It's all marked on the papers.
Gypsy, what about the bridge?

01:06:55.144 --> 01:06:58.980
Six hour interval.

01:07:00.024 --> 01:07:03.484
I stayed till they changed the watch,
at noon and at six.

01:07:03.861 --> 01:07:08.197
It was a long watch, Inglés. And cold!

01:07:08.657 --> 01:07:11.909
My ... my bones brea ...

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:17.248
How about the sawmill post?
Eight men and a corporal.

01:07:17.624 --> 01:07:22.211
No more arrived.
What about the roadmender's hut?

01:07:23.714 --> 01:07:28.718
I didn't get that far. I remembered
what you said. To be careful.

01:07:31.555 --> 01:07:35.516
Only ten cars?
All written down, Roberto.

01:07:35.976 --> 01:07:37.810
Inglés!

01:07:51.825 --> 01:07:54.035
How do you like it, Pilar?

01:07:56.663 --> 01:07:59.040
Very beautiful, the snow, huh?

01:07:59.416 --> 01:08:02.085
Get out of my sight!

01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:19.310
God help El Sordo.

01:08:20.854 --> 01:08:25.316
If it snows all night, it may cover his tracks.
If, if!

01:08:39.622 --> 01:08:42.166
How do you like it, woman?

01:08:42.626 --> 01:08:47.505
How do you like to command when it snows?
Shut up, drunkard!

01:08:49.925 --> 01:08:53.428
I know why you went to see El Sordo.

01:08:54.179 --> 01:08:59.142
Horses make tracks in the snow,
hey, Inglés? Yeah.

01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:09.152
Now there will be no offensive.
No bridge. No. Just snow.

01:09:09.611 --> 01:09:10.778
Yeah.

01:09:11.738 --> 01:09:15.198
And no making love in the heather!

01:09:16.535 --> 01:09:19.245
Watch your mouth!

01:09:25.711 --> 01:09:27.502
No. Let me.

01:09:32.885 --> 01:09:33.926
María!

01:09:44.645 --> 01:09:47.732
Wipe the table clean, María!

01:09:48.192 --> 01:09:50.902
Wipe your own spillings!

01:09:54.573 --> 01:09:58.576
Wipe first your chin, drunkard,
and then the table!

01:10:01.121 --> 01:10:04.415
Pay no attention to him. He's drunk.

01:10:05.083 --> 01:10:07.835
Fix my shoes, María.

01:10:15.886 --> 01:10:19.263
Are you really drunk?
Why not?

01:10:19.723 --> 01:10:22.016
But not too drunk to watch your mouth!

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:34.987
No one on guard at the top?
In this storm?

01:10:35.447 --> 01:10:38.282
What for? No soldiers will move
in these mountains tonight.

01:10:38.992 --> 01:10:40.743
Pilar, bring me something hot to eat!

01:10:46.291 --> 01:10:47.333
Wine, Inglés?

01:10:48.669 --> 01:10:53.256
I thought I was Roberto.
I call you Inglés before the others.

01:10:53.674 --> 01:10:55.091
Roberto?

01:10:56.134 --> 01:10:58.177
Don Roberto!

01:10:59.846 --> 01:11:05.601
How is Don Roberto?
Fine, Don Pablo. How's Bacchus?

01:11:06.645 --> 01:11:08.771
Who is Bacchus?

01:11:09.147 --> 01:11:11.649
You know. Your constant companion.

01:11:12.025 --> 01:11:14.151
I don't know such a man.

01:11:15.445 --> 01:11:20.825
You say funny things, Inglés.
Sure, I do. I'm a laugh a minute.

01:11:21.285 --> 01:11:25.121
Pay no attention. He's drunk.
Tell us, Inglés,

01:11:25.539 --> 01:11:28.749
why have you come so far
to fight for our Republic?

01:11:32.170 --> 01:11:37.508
A man fights for what he believes in, Fernando.
In his own country.

01:11:38.093 --> 01:11:42.597
Maybe you feel I'm sticking my nose
into other people's business,

01:11:43.056 --> 01:11:47.602
but I don't feel that way.
It's not only Spain fighting here.

01:11:48.562 --> 01:11:51.897
It's Germany and Italy
fighting Russia.

01:11:52.357 --> 01:11:56.611
And the Spanish are right in the
middle of it. The Nazis and fascists

01:11:56.987 --> 01:12:00.948
are against democracy
and against the communists.

01:12:01.325 --> 01:12:04.243
They're using your country
to test their new war machinery.

01:12:04.661 --> 01:12:10.750
Their tanks and dive-bombers. So they
can destroy democracies like England,

01:12:11.209 --> 01:12:14.462
France and my country before
we get armed and ready to fight.

01:12:14.838 --> 01:12:16.797
Were you always a Republican?

01:12:18.592 --> 01:12:23.262
And your father?
Sure. He always voted Republican.

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.724
Did they shoot him for it?

01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:31.103
No. They don't shoot you
for being a Republican in America.

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:34.774
Roberto was a professor.
He told me this afternoon.

01:12:35.233 --> 01:12:37.943
Not a professor, María. An instructor.

01:12:38.403 --> 01:12:41.614
That's the same thing.
He was a teacher in a college.

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:47.286
The professor has no beard.
He's a false professor.

01:12:47.746 --> 01:12:51.290
Shut up!
What did you teach, Inglés?

01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:55.670
Spanish.
That's how I got to know Spain.

01:12:56.129 --> 01:12:59.048
No beard. He has no beard.
He's a false professor.

01:12:59.424 --> 01:13:03.719
Stop it!
Wouldn't it be easier to teach English?

01:13:04.179 --> 01:13:07.723
Why shouldn't he teach Spanish?
Doesn't he speak it?

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:13.562
Yes, but in a way it is undignified
for a foreigner to teach Spanish.

01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:15.856
I mean nothing against you, Inglés.

01:13:16.233 --> 01:13:19.652
He doesn't teach it to Spaniards!
I should hope not ...

01:13:20.112 --> 01:13:24.573
Let me finish, you mule!
He teaches Spanish to Americans.

01:13:26.451 --> 01:13:31.580
Can't they speak Spanish?
Mule! North Americans speak English!

01:13:31.957 --> 01:13:35.793
No beard, no beard.
Enough!

01:13:36.169 --> 01:13:39.380
But he's got no beard. Beard ...

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:42.550
No beard.
He does have a beard.

01:13:44.052 --> 01:13:45.928
You should know, girl.

01:13:46.346 --> 01:13:49.932
Pay no attention, Inglés. He's drunk.
I don't think he's so drunk.

01:13:50.392 --> 01:13:54.145
Yes. Yes, I am drunk.

01:13:55.313 --> 01:13:56.814
I doubt it.

01:13:57.232 --> 01:13:59.442
Cowardly, yes!

01:14:05.157 --> 01:14:07.992
You try to provoke me, Inglés?

01:14:10.287 --> 01:14:12.872
No, you won't get rid of me that way.

01:14:13.874 --> 01:14:16.167
I said cowardly, not drunk!

01:14:16.918 --> 01:14:20.838
See? See, I don't provoke.

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:24.091
Signal to the woman
that you've failed.

01:14:24.551 --> 01:14:29.305
Pilar had nothing to do with it.
You spoke to the girl as a coward.

01:14:29.765 --> 01:14:31.891
I don't provoke.

01:14:34.186 --> 01:14:39.523
See, woman? I teach the professor
I don't provoke.

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:47.323
I'll still be alive,
when you're all dead!

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:00.377
I'm not stupid.

01:15:00.796 --> 01:15:03.130
I don't provoke.

01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:19.980
I don't provoke.

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:36.831
To the Professor,
to the Senora commander,

01:15:37.624 --> 01:15:42.253
and to all the illusioned ones.

01:15:44.589 --> 01:15:48.968
That's silly.
It's a waste of good wine.

01:15:51.388 --> 01:15:52.930
I don't provoke.

01:15:58.311 --> 01:16:00.062
I am drunk.

01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:04.567
The wise man gets drunk
to spend his time with fools.

01:16:05.068 --> 01:16:06.110
Get out!

01:16:06.528 --> 01:16:07.570
Yeah.

01:16:08.029 --> 01:16:10.197
Yeah, I go.

01:16:13.535 --> 01:16:17.955
I'll go to the horses.
They have more sense than men.

01:16:27.299 --> 01:16:33.137
Tell them about the bridge, Professor,
and how to escape afterwards.

01:16:35.223 --> 01:16:39.268
Who will lead your patriots in the retreat?
Get out!

01:17:03.543 --> 01:17:05.794
It's still falling, Inglés.

01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:19.683
Let me go! I'll kill him!
Give me that rifle!

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:27.691
Why didn't you kill him last night?

01:17:28.151 --> 01:17:31.904
What do you think he'll do now?
He will toss a bomb in here.

01:17:32.364 --> 01:17:35.908
Give me your pistol. I'll shoot him.
You want to blow us up?

01:17:36.368 --> 01:17:40.329
What fools we are!
Why didn't you kill him last night?

01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:43.040
He's got to die now!

01:17:44.084 --> 01:17:45.584
Pilar?

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:48.879
What do you say, Pilar?

01:17:49.923 --> 01:17:51.215
Yes.

01:17:52.676 --> 01:17:54.760
Whatever you will,

01:17:55.804 --> 01:17:57.638
I'm for it now.

01:18:00.016 --> 01:18:03.686
Then let all speak.
Andrés, what do you say?

01:18:04.062 --> 01:18:07.189
Yes, kill him!
Kill him.

01:18:07.941 --> 01:18:09.525
Primitivo?
Kill him.

01:18:09.985 --> 01:18:12.945
Agustín?
Do you need to ask? Kill him!

01:18:13.905 --> 01:18:19.535
Fernando?
Don't forget, Inglés, he's smart and he knows the mountains.

01:18:19.953 --> 01:18:23.497
Who will lead our retreat after the bridge?
El Sordo!

01:18:23.873 --> 01:18:28.544
He knows the way. Pilar, tell him
that El Sordo will lead us.

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:32.673
Couldn't we hold him as a prisoner?
Who would look after him?

01:18:33.091 --> 01:18:36.218
He is right, Fernando.
It would take us all to watch him.

01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:42.182
Why not sell him to the enemy?
Shut up, Gypsy.

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:45.769
That's filthy!
No worse than Pablo.

01:18:47.272 --> 01:18:51.066
If you'd blind him,
he will be easy to handle.

01:18:51.484 --> 01:18:54.028
Watch your tongue, Gypsy!

01:18:54.404 --> 01:18:57.239
Didn't Pablo blind the civil guard
who was wounded?

01:18:57.657 --> 01:19:00.325
Speak of blinding again
and you go with Pablo.

01:19:01.327 --> 01:19:04.288
Pilar,
I haven't been allowed to finish yet.

01:19:04.664 --> 01:19:06.623
Finish, then, finish!

01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:09.835
I still maintain we need Pablo.

01:19:10.253 --> 01:19:15.007
We should reason with him and point out that his conduct ...
Stop it!

01:19:15.425 --> 01:19:19.136
Even here one man can make
a bureaucracy with his mouth!

01:19:21.097 --> 01:19:26.143
You've voted to kill him.
Now have done with it!

01:19:29.355 --> 01:19:33.275
Kill him when he returns.
He must make the first move.

01:19:33.693 --> 01:19:38.947
Why wait? Kill him!
In cold blood? You Ingleses are all cold.

01:19:39.365 --> 01:19:41.700
Give me your gun! I'm burning!

01:19:42.077 --> 01:19:45.287
Not in here. No shooting in here.

01:19:47.707 --> 01:19:51.877
You'll see how cold my blood is
when that coward comes back!

01:20:01.513 --> 01:20:04.389
Ugly. All of it's ugly!

01:20:10.605 --> 01:20:15.484
Remember one thing, Inglés.
He wasn't always like this.

01:20:16.444 --> 01:20:19.363
When the war broke out,
he wasn't the man you see now.

01:20:19.739 --> 01:20:23.575
Brutal, yes,
but a leader without fear.

01:20:24.494 --> 01:20:27.955
Without Pablo's help, the Nationalists
would have taken our town

01:20:28.331 --> 01:20:32.292
the day the revolution began,
for many Nationalists lived there.

01:20:32.752 --> 01:20:36.130
But Pablo organized the people,
and in the night

01:20:36.506 --> 01:20:41.885
all suspects were dragged from their
beds and locked up in the city hall.

01:20:42.345 --> 01:20:45.806
In the dark,
he surrounded the police barracks,

01:20:46.266 --> 01:20:51.228
cut the telephone wires
and placed dynamite under the wall.

01:20:51.688 --> 01:20:55.149
When morning came, he called on
the civil guards to surrender,

01:20:55.567 --> 01:20:59.236
but they wouldn't.
So he blew the wall open.

01:21:06.703 --> 01:21:09.955
But then there was a shout
for us to stop firing

01:21:10.415 --> 01:21:13.750
and four civil guards
walked out with their hands up.

01:21:14.127 --> 01:21:19.006
Pablo said, "Show us how to die,
you who have always done the killing."

01:21:19.382 --> 01:21:22.968
"What are you going to do?",
the officer asked. "Shoot you."

01:21:23.344 --> 01:21:25.971
Pablo passed behind them.

01:21:26.347 --> 01:21:32.603
I can hear the pistol even now
and see the head of each man fall.

01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:35.981
One held his head still
when the pistol touched it.

01:21:36.441 --> 01:21:39.902
One shivered in his whole body
and his head was shaking.

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:44.406
Only one put his hands in front of his
eyes and he was the last one.

01:21:44.866 --> 01:21:50.579
The hat fell from his head
and Pablo said, "Pilar, he's polite.

01:21:51.039 --> 01:21:53.957
He takes off his hat
for a woman like you!"

01:21:58.671 --> 01:22:02.799
A crowd was gathering
in the plaza before the city hall.

01:22:03.635 --> 01:22:05.844
"Why is it done this way?",
they asked Pablo.

01:22:06.221 --> 01:22:10.307
"To save bullets,"he said,
"and to make all of you share in it."

01:22:10.767 --> 01:22:13.936
I had picked up that hat
and a man said,

01:22:14.312 --> 01:22:19.816
"Pilar, that's bad taste.
We're done with civil guards now."

01:22:26.824 --> 01:22:29.701
Drunkards yelled,
as if at a bullfight,

01:22:30.078 --> 01:22:32.704
"Let the bull out!
Pablo, let the bull out!"

01:22:33.081 --> 01:22:36.416
And then everyone shouted,
"Here comes the first one!"

01:22:36.876 --> 01:22:40.128
It was Don Perito García, the mayor.

01:22:40.505 --> 01:22:44.675
He walked between the lines
and nothing happened.

01:22:45.134 --> 01:22:48.595
He passed two men, four men,

01:22:48.972 --> 01:22:52.015
eight men, and nothing happened.

01:22:52.475 --> 01:22:56.645
From the roof someone shouted,
"What's the matter, coward?"

01:22:57.063 --> 01:22:58.814
But nothing happened.

01:22:59.190 --> 01:23:01.483
I was watching one man
who had a dispute with the mayor

01:23:01.943 --> 01:23:05.237
about a piece of land,
and who hated him.

01:23:05.613 --> 01:23:08.532
And it was this man
who first raised his flail.

01:23:24.173 --> 01:23:27.301
Don Faustino Rivera
was known as an annoyer of girls.

01:23:27.719 --> 01:23:32.055
He wanted to be known as a bullfighter
and went much with them and Gypsies.

01:23:32.473 --> 01:23:34.975
But he was a coward
and was considered a joke.

01:23:35.435 --> 01:23:39.229
But he was inspired by the example
of Don García and he stood there

01:23:39.689 --> 01:23:43.608
looking handsome and brave,
and he made his face scornful.

01:23:43.985 --> 01:23:47.070
Now the lines began to shout,
"Listen Don Faustino,

01:23:47.447 --> 01:23:52.326
there are beautiful girls over
the cliff, why don't you chase them?"

01:24:23.399 --> 01:24:26.526
It was then I knew
that the lines had become savage,

01:24:26.903 --> 01:24:32.824
caused by the insult of Don García
and the cowardice of Don Faustino.

01:24:33.201 --> 01:24:37.662
Don Guillermo wasn't a bad man. He was
only in politics because of his wife.

01:24:38.122 --> 01:24:40.999
I heard her screaming, "Guillermo,

01:24:41.376 --> 01:24:44.211
husband, wait. I'll go with you!"

01:24:45.296 --> 01:24:49.091
He couldn't see her without his
glasses, but he looked up and waved.

01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:52.177
And no one would hit him.

01:24:52.637 --> 01:24:55.389
Then a drunkard yelled,
"Guillermo!"

01:25:09.904 --> 01:25:14.908
"What bothers Pilar?", they asked me.
"I'm sick,"I told them.

01:25:15.368 --> 01:25:20.163
And they said, "Us too.
We'll take no further part in it."

01:25:20.623 --> 01:25:23.041
But the worst was yet to come, Inglés,

01:25:23.459 --> 01:25:28.422
when Pablo opened the city hall door
and let the mob in to kill the rest.

01:25:29.298 --> 01:25:35.095
For yes, it was now a mob,
lacking any organization.

01:25:41.269 --> 01:25:43.270
The snow has stopped, Inglés.

01:25:43.729 --> 01:25:46.064
Now we'll have
good weather for the bridge.

01:25:46.482 --> 01:25:49.109
Yes, I've come back to help you.

01:25:49.527 --> 01:25:52.237
I cannot desert Pilar and my people.

01:25:53.573 --> 01:25:55.073
Wait, man!

01:26:05.168 --> 01:26:09.379
What trick is this, drunkard?
No trick, Pilar.

01:26:09.839 --> 01:26:12.215
I've changed my mind, that's all.

01:26:12.675 --> 01:26:17.053
You're right about the bridge
and I'm with you now.

01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:22.184
You'll need me for the retreat.
Just what I said.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.186
You were listening!

01:26:24.562 --> 01:26:28.356
You're afraid of being killed.
That's why you've changed.

01:26:28.733 --> 01:26:34.029
Do you think I like to hear
how we killed those men?

01:26:34.447 --> 01:26:37.949
If I could bring them back to life, I'd do it.
Liar!

01:26:38.326 --> 01:26:42.245
No, I mean it. I wish
I could bring them back to life,

01:26:42.622 --> 01:26:45.415
even Don Ricardo who cursed me.
Stop it!

01:26:45.833 --> 01:26:50.045
Yes, I would restore them all to life.
That's God's truth.

01:26:52.590 --> 01:26:56.801
And it's also true
that I'm with you now.

01:26:58.429 --> 01:27:00.597
I was drunk.

01:27:01.015 --> 01:27:04.684
Now I'm not drunk
and I've changed my mind.

01:27:05.144 --> 01:27:11.483
Either trust me or not, but no one
can get you to the Gredos as I can.

01:27:11.901 --> 01:27:15.654
I believe you.
But take an oath.

01:27:16.072 --> 01:27:20.492
Are you with us and for the bridge?
Yes, man.

01:27:21.369 --> 01:27:26.081
You think it can be successful despite the snow?
There will be no snow.

01:27:26.457 --> 01:27:28.750
You have confidence?

01:27:29.794 --> 01:27:31.419
Why not?

01:27:32.547 --> 01:27:35.340
Fools! Lunatics!

01:27:35.716 --> 01:27:39.010
You're all crazy if you believe him!

01:33:20.394 --> 01:33:23.187
What, Roberto?
A trooper.

01:33:24.231 --> 01:33:27.817
What does it mean?
I don't know.

01:33:37.328 --> 01:33:40.121
See anything?
No.

01:33:41.665 --> 01:33:44.500
Are you sure it was a trooper?
Yes.

01:33:44.877 --> 01:33:47.462
Where's Pablo?
In the cave.

01:34:31.465 --> 01:34:35.385
Man, what a horse!
Never mind, get in the saddle.

01:34:36.011 --> 01:34:39.973
This horse must make tracks out again.
You have much sense, Inglés.

01:34:40.599 --> 01:34:43.393
I'll ride him in the hills
until the snow's melted.

01:34:43.852 --> 01:34:46.854
Keep your eyes open.
There's bound to be more cavalry.

01:34:47.231 --> 01:34:51.025
Get the machine gun and my binoculars.
We've got to cover the pass.

01:34:51.402 --> 01:34:54.529
Both of you give him a hand.
Go back to that soldier

01:34:54.905 --> 01:34:57.448
and see if you can find more clips.

01:34:57.825 --> 01:35:00.702
And leave his pockets alone!

01:35:04.957 --> 01:35:08.292
Roberto! Roberto, I'm coming with you!

01:35:08.752 --> 01:35:11.629
Go back. Tell Pilar to pack. We may have to run for it.
No.

01:35:12.089 --> 01:35:15.383
Go back, María. There may be a fight.
I'll help you. No!

01:35:15.801 --> 01:35:18.678
Let me help you.
Go back!

01:35:19.138 --> 01:35:22.682
Let me go with you. I want to help.
Then go back!

01:35:24.601 --> 01:35:26.227
Kiss me.

01:35:27.563 --> 01:35:30.231
You're shameless.
Yes.

01:36:01.472 --> 01:36:04.515
What's happened to that Gypsy?
I saw him coming down.

01:36:04.975 --> 01:36:07.560
Then he saw a rabbit
and went after it.

01:36:10.814 --> 01:36:15.485
Fine time to go hunting. Primitivo,
climb up that rock as high as you can.

01:36:15.861 --> 01:36:19.030
If you see soldiers,
throw a stone for a signal. Wait.

01:36:19.448 --> 01:36:22.408
If you see one soldier, raise your rifle like this.
Like this?

01:36:22.868 --> 01:36:27.080
If more than one, pump it like this.
One for each soldier. Understand?

01:36:27.456 --> 01:36:28.581
Yes.

01:36:29.416 --> 01:36:35.463
Anselmo, go to Agustín and hold
the gun's legs, if I have to shoot.

01:39:02.027 --> 01:39:07.281
Here, hold this for me.
For what? I'm liable to shoot me a Gypsy.

01:39:09.368 --> 01:39:12.912
Look! Now we'll have fresh meat.

01:39:13.372 --> 01:39:16.832
See?
Does something annoy Roberto?

01:39:17.251 --> 01:39:21.212
If you weren't a Gypsy, I'd shoot you!
But why?

01:39:21.672 --> 01:39:24.966
Look at how fat they are!

01:39:35.852 --> 01:39:36.936
Get down!

01:40:47.924 --> 01:40:50.885
Rifles!
Now the soldiers are hunting.

01:40:54.181 --> 01:40:55.681
Wait here.

01:41:06.943 --> 01:41:10.112
Is it Pablo?
El Sordo.

01:43:03.518 --> 01:43:07.938
Come, Inglés, now they need us.
Where? To join in with El Sordo.

01:43:08.315 --> 01:43:11.275
To die there?
Don't you realize they're lost?

01:43:11.651 --> 01:43:15.154
It's too risky.
We have to think about the bridge.

01:43:15.572 --> 01:43:18.866
Why that's our friend El Sordo!
Listen ... I listen to that!

01:43:19.326 --> 01:43:22.036
Are you afraid
to fight for our friends?

01:43:39.971 --> 01:43:41.680
Roberto!

01:43:49.981 --> 01:43:53.192
We could hear the firing at the cave.
I was afraid ...

01:43:53.652 --> 01:43:57.363
You shouldn't have come here.
I let her. She was half crazy.

01:43:57.822 --> 01:44:00.533
She thought you were fighting.
Why aren't we fighting?

01:44:00.992 --> 01:44:05.162
They want to go to El Sordo.
Have you lost your minds?

01:44:05.539 --> 01:44:07.790
What kind of locos are you?

01:44:08.250 --> 01:44:11.544
Men, not women!
Then act like men!

01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:15.798
You'll die soon enough.
Swallow your tongue and choke!

01:44:16.174 --> 01:44:17.466
Silence!

01:44:17.884 --> 01:44:20.970
What use is courage
if you have no head?

01:44:21.346 --> 01:44:25.516
El Sordo has both.
He'll understand.

01:44:27.310 --> 01:44:29.478
Was he coming with the horses?

01:44:29.896 --> 01:44:35.276
Looks like he did his best
to lead them away from us.

01:44:40.699 --> 01:44:44.493
Did you hit him?
Pot full of greasebacked bat.

01:44:44.953 --> 01:44:47.454
I'll tell you
who's a pot full of grease:

01:44:47.914 --> 01:44:51.125
Pilar. She knows we are dying here.

01:44:51.501 --> 01:44:55.588
What could Pilar do?
Take them from the rear. How?

01:44:56.047 --> 01:45:01.343
They're all around the hill.
100, 200... maybe more now.

01:45:09.269 --> 01:45:13.022
Bandidos, cobardes! Can you hear me?

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:15.774
You sons of four-legged devils!

01:45:16.568 --> 01:45:20.613
Surrender now, you bandits,
before our planes blow you to bits!

01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:25.326
Will they send planes?

01:45:26.953 --> 01:45:31.081
With bombs or machine guns?
Both, my son.

01:45:33.168 --> 01:45:36.587
I'm giving you a chance to surrender
before the planes come.

01:45:37.047 --> 01:45:39.298
You hear what I am saying, bandidos?

01:45:39.674 --> 01:45:42.676
Let's insult him.
Maybe he'll show his head.

01:45:43.094 --> 01:45:48.432
Do you surrender?
Who has a big pistol? Here.

01:45:49.601 --> 01:45:53.854
The planes are coming!
Do you surrender?

01:45:54.773 --> 01:45:59.318
He can't wait for the planes.
He wants to be a hero,

01:45:59.694 --> 01:46:02.363
to lead us back
with a rope around our necks.

01:46:41.236 --> 01:46:44.780
Have you seen any movement since the shots?
No sir.

01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:48.492
What do you think?
I don't believe it.

01:46:48.910 --> 01:46:52.037
Why shouldn't they do it?
They knew they had to die.

01:46:52.497 --> 01:46:54.790
It's better than being bombed
or captured, isn't it?

01:46:55.208 --> 01:46:58.043
I think it's a trick.
What about the planes?

01:46:58.503 --> 01:47:02.131
They should have come a long time ago.

01:47:02.549 --> 01:47:06.135
How many shots did you count?
Five. It's ridiculous

01:47:06.511 --> 01:47:11.598
if they are dead! Ridiculous
to hide down here from dead men!

01:47:12.058 --> 01:47:15.310
I think we should wait
for the planes, sir.

01:47:20.483 --> 01:47:23.360
Fire, cowards, if you are alive!

01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:27.156
Fire on a man
who has no fear of you!

01:47:27.574 --> 01:47:30.868
Shoot, you saffron-bellied swine!

01:47:36.916 --> 01:47:41.170
Now do you believe me?
No one's alive up there.

01:47:41.588 --> 01:47:44.882
You! Go up and see.

01:47:46.217 --> 01:47:51.054
Don't you hear me?
Yes, my captain. Then go!

01:47:51.347 --> 01:47:55.350
Do you hear me?
Yes, my captain. Why don't you go then?

01:47:55.727 --> 01:47:59.438
I don't want to, my captain.
You don't want to?

01:47:59.814 --> 01:48:02.858
I'm afraid, my captain.
Captain Mora! Lieutenant Berrendo!

01:48:03.276 --> 01:48:06.653
It is possible the soldier is right.
Right to say he's afraid?

01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:11.366
Right to say he wants to disobey?
No sir. Right that it's a trick!

01:48:11.826 --> 01:48:16.413
Don't you hear me, they're all dead.
You mean our comrades on the slope?

01:48:16.831 --> 01:48:21.543
I agree, sir.
Very well, the sniper stays here.

01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:25.631
I'll take care of him later.
You and I will go to the top.

01:48:26.216 --> 01:48:30.636
Not me.
What? I will go if you order me. But under protest.

01:48:31.095 --> 01:48:37.726
No, I'll go alone. The smell
of cowardice is too strong here.

01:48:40.396 --> 01:48:42.731
Assassins! Cowards!

01:48:43.149 --> 01:48:45.692
Shoot me! Kill me!

01:48:46.945 --> 01:48:50.989
Can you hear me coming?
No, you can't hear me coming.

01:48:51.449 --> 01:48:55.619
You think I'm a coward
like the others? Shoot me!

01:48:55.995 --> 01:48:59.373
Kill me!
"Shoot me! Kill me!"

01:48:59.624 --> 01:49:02.084
Cowards!
Look at him coming.

01:49:02.544 --> 01:49:05.712
Scum of the earth!
What an animal! Shoot me if you are alive!

01:49:06.089 --> 01:49:09.967
Look at him stride.
Bandidos! This one is for me.

01:49:10.343 --> 01:49:14.429
Do you hear me?
This one we take with us. No, you don't hear.

01:49:14.848 --> 01:49:17.558
Keep walking.
Cowards!

01:49:17.684 --> 01:49:21.728
Look at the stars. He's a captain.
Stick out your chest, little captain.

01:49:22.188 --> 01:49:26.525
I will kill you with a bullet!
Don't stop. Don't be late, captain.

01:49:26.901 --> 01:49:29.820
You vermin!
A long voyage ...

01:49:30.238 --> 01:49:33.073
Fire! Cowards!
If you are alive! Come on.

01:49:34.868 --> 01:49:38.620
Now comrade voyager, close enough.
Come on, voyager.

01:49:38.997 --> 01:49:40.581
Can you hear me coming?

01:49:40.957 --> 01:49:43.166
No, you can't hear me coming.

01:49:43.626 --> 01:49:45.544
I am coming.

01:49:53.595 --> 01:49:55.971
"Kill me! Shoot me!"

01:50:22.123 --> 01:50:23.582
Joaquín!

01:50:24.584 --> 01:50:25.667
Quick!

01:50:29.797 --> 01:50:31.256
A little higher!

01:51:10.672 --> 01:51:11.797
Pilar!

01:51:40.159 --> 01:51:41.493
Pilar!

01:52:35.548 --> 01:52:37.340
Hola, Pilar.
Hola.

01:52:37.717 --> 01:52:39.760
Salud, Roberto.
Salud.

01:52:48.102 --> 01:52:49.811
Salud, Pilar.

01:52:50.438 --> 01:52:53.565
Look at him. Already at the wine!

01:52:54.025 --> 01:52:57.110
Did you come back for us, or the wine?
Both.

01:52:57.487 --> 01:52:59.905
He came back for his horses.

01:53:00.990 --> 01:53:06.411
Much riding, Inglés. I couldn't turn
back till the snow has melted.

01:53:07.747 --> 01:53:12.667
Didn't you run into the cavalry?
A good horse, the new one.

01:53:13.086 --> 01:53:16.922
I took to high ground
and came back through the hills.

01:53:19.092 --> 01:53:22.135
No food, Pilar? Where have you been?
Guarding the pass below.

01:53:22.512 --> 01:53:25.722
We had to wait
until there was no more cavalry.

01:53:26.432 --> 01:53:27.474
Inglés!

01:53:30.103 --> 01:53:33.396
Inglés! I was with El Sordo.

01:53:38.194 --> 01:53:41.029
You were in the fight?
No.

01:53:42.406 --> 01:53:44.699
On my way back here ...

01:53:45.159 --> 01:53:49.830
It was dark and I went up the hill.

01:53:52.750 --> 01:53:57.671
Five dead at the top.
They'd taken their heads.

01:53:59.507 --> 01:54:01.341
Joaquín too?

01:54:04.053 --> 01:54:06.680
No heads ...
Now let the fighting come.

01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:09.307
No heads.
Inglés!

01:54:09.684 --> 01:54:12.727
Anselmo says there is
much movement across the bridge.

01:54:14.272 --> 01:54:17.357
I was just leaving the lookout when it started.
What?

01:54:17.817 --> 01:54:22.654
Guns, trucks, armored cars, even tanks.
Tanks?

01:54:23.114 --> 01:54:28.243
Everything moving up toward the front.
I marked it all down.

01:54:29.287 --> 01:54:32.873
I waited till the second column had crossed.
Anything more coming?

01:54:33.291 --> 01:54:38.086
Yes, I could hear another column
as I came up through the pass.

01:54:38.462 --> 01:54:41.882
Should I go back?
Not now. Were these trucks full of soldiers?

01:54:42.258 --> 01:54:44.593
Yes. What does it mean?

01:54:45.052 --> 01:54:49.973
They know the Republic is going
to attack when the sun rises.

01:54:50.433 --> 01:54:54.186
Yes, now they know.
They move up to meet our offensive.

01:54:55.104 --> 01:54:57.647
Who knows the way through to the Republicans?
I do.

01:54:58.024 --> 01:55:01.735
I need you at the bridge. Who else?
I know it.

01:55:02.111 --> 01:55:05.864
Have you been through before?
Twice. 8 hours, nearly 9 hours.

01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:09.242
Can you make it to Navacerrada?
I can try.

01:55:09.619 --> 01:55:14.331
I could do it in less time, with luck and no pack.
I need you here.

01:55:14.874 --> 01:55:18.627
Our route was longer because
we carried explosive. It was safer.

01:55:19.003 --> 01:55:24.382
I will get there as well as another.
And something could happen to anyone.

01:55:36.395 --> 01:55:41.233
This dispatch is for General Golz.
Remember the name, "Golz".

01:55:41.651 --> 01:55:44.945
Where will I find him?
Ask when you get to our lines.

01:55:45.404 --> 01:55:50.617
This seal ought to get you through.
If you have problems, show this here.

01:55:51.035 --> 01:55:55.580
You've got seven hours at the most.
The attack is set for sunrise.

01:55:56.040 --> 01:56:00.961
I prefer to be with you at the bridge.
Get this to General Golz

01:56:01.420 --> 01:56:04.256
and we won't have to blow the bridge.
We'll all escape to the Gredos safely.

01:56:04.632 --> 01:56:08.677
Remember, the bridge's got to go
if the attack starts.

01:56:09.053 --> 01:56:12.097
Pablo! Pablo, come back!

01:56:12.556 --> 01:56:13.807
Pilar!

01:56:14.183 --> 01:56:16.268
Pablo has gone!

01:56:17.019 --> 01:56:20.522
Didn't I tell you he was a coward?
You and your confidence!

01:56:20.982 --> 01:56:24.234
If it wasn't for you,
I would have killed him last night!

01:56:24.610 --> 01:56:29.364
I have been betrayed.
Betrayed! Listen to him!

01:56:29.740 --> 01:56:33.868
He has been betrayed! You fool!

01:56:34.745 --> 01:56:39.165
No slanders, please!
Forget it! I'm the one to blame.

01:56:39.625 --> 01:56:44.170
Andrés, you better get going.
And good luck.

01:56:48.217 --> 01:56:51.011
Should I go back
and guard the horses?

01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:54.222
Fool!
No. I'll look after them.

01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:57.434
Who will lead the retreat now?
Shut up, Gypsy!

01:56:57.810 --> 01:57:01.354
Andrés will get to the general.
Get back in the cave. Pilar,

01:57:01.814 --> 01:57:04.816
get everything ready for the bridge.
And get some sleep.

01:57:05.192 --> 01:57:09.446
I'll look after the horses.
Look after my things.

01:57:23.878 --> 01:57:25.045
Salud!

01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:29.299
Don't shoot, comrades.
Who are you?

01:57:30.343 --> 01:57:33.428
A comrade, Andrés Lopez,
with a dispatch for General Golz.

01:57:33.888 --> 01:57:38.475
Say the password, if you're a comrade!
I don't know any password.

01:57:38.893 --> 01:57:42.062
Toss a bomb at him.
No, that would be a great mistake.

01:57:42.521 --> 01:57:44.731
He's not alone, Pedro. Toss a bomb!
No. Please.

01:57:45.149 --> 01:57:48.651
I'm completely by myself.
Allow me to show you my papers.

01:57:49.028 --> 01:57:54.199
Sure you're alone?
How many times must I to tell you?

01:57:54.617 --> 01:57:55.742
Stand up!

01:57:57.536 --> 01:58:00.413
Put your hands above your head!

01:58:00.831 --> 01:58:02.290
Come on!

01:58:07.380 --> 01:58:11.633
I'm in a big hurry. I have a dispatch
for General Golz at Navacerrada.

01:58:12.009 --> 01:58:15.804
Where?
Inside my shirt. How can I show it to you with my hands up?

01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:21.226
You're a long way from Navacerrada.
I will take you to Captain Gómez.

01:58:23.020 --> 01:58:24.354
Spy!

01:58:49.213 --> 01:58:52.340
I brought your robe.
I'll fix it for you.

01:58:58.180 --> 01:59:01.099
Was this your idea or Pilar's?

01:59:01.559 --> 01:59:05.228
Mine.
But Pilar told me to come.

01:59:09.608 --> 01:59:13.361
Even if she'd told me not to come,
I would have come.

01:59:20.995 --> 01:59:25.707
Will there be fighting tomorrow?
Are you afraid?

01:59:27.042 --> 01:59:31.171
I'm afraid for you so much
I do not think of me.

01:59:32.256 --> 01:59:35.508
Pilar told me that
I'm to go with you, after the bridge.

01:59:35.968 --> 01:59:39.929
That you'll take me to the Republic.
You and Pilar will have horses.

01:59:40.389 --> 01:59:43.600
You'll be safe with Pilar.
That leaves 3 horses for the others.

01:59:44.018 --> 01:59:46.644
But I go with you, not Pilar.

01:59:47.021 --> 01:59:50.273
I came on foot with the old man and shall go the same way.
No!

01:59:50.733 --> 01:59:54.110
Pilar says no one
will get out alive without a horse.

01:59:54.528 --> 01:59:59.491
But if Andrés gets through,
there will be no bridge, will there?

02:00:00.743 --> 02:00:02.702
Will there, Roberto?

02:00:04.747 --> 02:00:06.414
No.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:12.795
Maybe I should've sent word sooner
about the movements here.

02:00:21.639 --> 02:00:23.598
How much time have we left?

02:00:25.059 --> 02:00:26.768
A lifetime, María.

02:00:32.399 --> 02:00:34.609
I mean until daylight.

02:00:37.446 --> 02:00:39.739
Five, six hours.

02:00:41.367 --> 02:00:44.702
Pilar told me
that time is not important.

02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:47.205
Maybe Pilar's right.

02:00:47.623 --> 02:00:52.085
Three days and three nights.
Yet they're everything.

02:00:52.461 --> 02:00:57.257
Longer than the months in prison.
Longer than the years I've lived.

02:00:59.718 --> 02:01:04.138
She told me something else
when I left the cave:

02:01:04.598 --> 02:01:08.184
"We must live all our life
in the time that remains."

02:01:08.644 --> 02:01:12.480
She said ...
What?

02:01:20.197 --> 02:01:23.992
What did she tell you?
We would all die tomorrow.

02:01:24.451 --> 02:01:27.704
And that you know it too.
She's crazy.

02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:31.207
Nothing more than Gypsy superstition.

02:01:32.251 --> 02:01:34.877
You don't believe it?
Of course not.

02:01:37.506 --> 02:01:41.718
She had a reason for telling me.
She said I must tell you all

02:01:42.177 --> 02:01:44.887
that happened to me
when they shot my mother and father.

02:01:45.347 --> 02:01:48.182
You've told me.
No.

02:01:49.602 --> 02:01:52.729
No, I didn't tell you what happened
when they herded us up the hill

02:01:53.105 --> 02:01:55.857
and to the barber shop.
I don't want to hear it.

02:01:56.233 --> 02:01:58.568
Two men looked at me and one said,

02:01:59.028 --> 02:02:01.529
"That's the daughter of the mayor."

02:02:02.656 --> 02:02:06.909
The other said, "Commence with her."
They took me to the barber shop

02:02:07.369 --> 02:02:10.830
and put me in the chair and held me.

02:02:12.708 --> 02:02:15.668
In the mirror I could only see
my mother and my father

02:02:16.045 --> 02:02:18.963
at the moment of the shooting.

02:02:19.381 --> 02:02:24.344
My mother's words were in my head
like a scream that went on and on.

02:02:25.846 --> 02:02:28.348
And I could fell a pain.

02:02:28.766 --> 02:02:32.101
They were pulling at my hair
and cutting it off with a razor.

02:02:32.519 --> 02:02:35.855
And then they put the braids
in my mouth ...

02:02:36.315 --> 02:02:39.442
and tied them around my neck
to make a gag.

02:02:39.818 --> 02:02:43.821
Then they ran clippers across my head.

02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:51.704
I commenced to cry, because until then
I'd been too frozen to feel anything.

02:02:53.082 --> 02:02:56.376
In the mirror,
I could see the men laugh.

02:02:57.670 --> 02:03:03.424
I couldn't look away from the horror
my face made with braids in my mouth.

02:03:09.223 --> 02:03:12.809
When they took me out,
I stumbled over the dead barber.

02:03:13.185 --> 02:03:16.187
They had shot him
because he belonged to a union.

02:03:16.563 --> 02:03:21.526
Then I saw my best friend
being dragged in by two more men.

02:03:21.944 --> 02:03:25.571
When she saw me, she screamed.
She screamed the whole time

02:03:25.948 --> 02:03:28.199
they were shoving me
across the square

02:03:28.659 --> 02:03:33.454
and into the doorway
and up the stairs of the city hall,

02:03:33.914 --> 02:03:38.835
to the office of my father, where they put me on the couch.
María.

02:03:42.381 --> 02:03:47.593
The worst things were done there.
Quiet. Don't think about it.

02:03:51.432 --> 02:03:54.517
I was going to tell you
on the way back from El Sordo,

02:03:54.893 --> 02:03:58.688
but I was glad
when you wouldn't let me.

02:03:59.064 --> 02:04:02.483
Then I was happy,
as if it had never happened.

02:04:02.943 --> 02:04:07.822
No. Tonight, Pilar said
I must tell you everything.

02:04:08.866 --> 02:04:11.826
And now you won't love me.

02:04:13.287 --> 02:04:18.249
Tomorrow you'll take me through the
lines and I'll never see you again.

02:04:18.709 --> 02:04:22.003
Never. You won't want me.

02:04:24.173 --> 02:04:27.216
No, Roberto,
we can't change things.

02:04:30.929 --> 02:04:35.641
But it's true
I never kissed any man until you.

02:04:36.059 --> 02:04:41.189
When it happened I fought until they tied my arms.
No one's touched you!

02:04:42.691 --> 02:04:45.818
You believe that?
I know that.

02:04:47.237 --> 02:04:49.530
And you can love me?

02:04:52.367 --> 02:04:54.911
I can love you more.

02:05:18.143 --> 02:05:21.854
I could see your headlight from afar.
You want to bring down a shelling?

02:05:22.314 --> 02:05:25.775
Where is the lieutenant colonel?
He's asleep. Who is the bandit?

02:05:26.235 --> 02:05:28.986
He bears a dispatch for General Golz
who commands the attack.

02:05:29.446 --> 02:05:33.908
You're crazy. I know no General Golz,
nor no attack.

02:05:34.284 --> 02:05:38.037
Get back to your battalion.
Call the lieutenant colonel.

02:05:38.413 --> 02:05:40.164
Away!

02:05:40.541 --> 02:05:42.166
Call him!

02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:48.714
All you barbers are emotional.
Orderly!

02:05:51.927 --> 02:05:56.806
Call the lieutenant colonel. Don't
forget, I'm your superior officer.

02:05:57.182 --> 02:06:01.269
I'm not afraid of your threats. Cynics
like you would be eliminated ...

02:06:01.728 --> 02:06:06.065
"First" is the word you want.
As long as they liquidate you.

02:06:06.441 --> 02:06:10.278
"Liquidated" is a word foreign to Spain.
Shot, then!

02:06:10.654 --> 02:06:15.867
That's Spanish, can you understand it?
Yes, but don't talk so loud!

02:06:16.326 --> 02:06:18.703
Your emotions bore me.

02:06:19.955 --> 02:06:22.707
Hello, Gómez.
Colonel.

02:06:23.083 --> 02:06:25.251
What brings you?

02:06:34.636 --> 02:06:37.471
Why didn't this get here sooner?
Stupidity.

02:06:37.848 --> 02:06:41.142
I'm not sure
you can get through now.

02:06:41.602 --> 02:06:46.022
Write them a very strong safe-conduct.
You'll need something strong tonight.

02:06:46.481 --> 02:06:48.733
We're careful before an offensive.

02:06:49.109 --> 02:06:51.152
You know
what I've been thinking about?

02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:55.698
What I should do
to take care of you well.

02:06:56.158 --> 02:07:00.912
I'll learn from Pilar
and other things you can tell me.

02:07:01.371 --> 02:07:04.790
What about me taking care of myself?
But you don't.

02:07:05.250 --> 02:07:09.754
You should have hung out your
sleeping robe in the sun this morning.

02:07:10.130 --> 02:07:15.092
Before the dew comes, it should have been taken in.
Go on.

02:07:16.178 --> 02:07:19.263
Your socks should be washed.
I would see that you have two pairs.

02:07:19.681 --> 02:07:21.182
What else?

02:07:23.268 --> 02:07:26.854
This. I would learn how to fire it.

02:07:27.314 --> 02:07:32.109
That's easy. I'll teach you.
Then if you're wounded,

02:07:32.569 --> 02:07:34.904
I could kill you and then myself.

02:07:36.573 --> 02:07:39.075
Do you have many ideas like that?

02:07:39.493 --> 02:07:44.705
No, not many.
But it's a good one in this war.

02:07:45.749 --> 02:07:49.126
Pilar gave me this one
and showed me how to use it.

02:07:49.503 --> 02:07:52.463
I always keep it with me.
Razor blade?

02:07:52.839 --> 02:07:57.051
She says there's no pain
if you press quickly and firmly.

02:07:57.511 --> 02:07:59.720
And they can't stop it if it's done.

02:08:00.097 --> 02:08:04.433
Not if you cut the artery.
How long have you had it?

02:08:04.893 --> 02:08:07.228
Ever since I was rescued.

02:08:10.357 --> 02:08:14.068
But I'd rather have you shoot me.

02:08:14.486 --> 02:08:18.114
Promise me if there's ever any need
that you will shoot me.

02:08:20.367 --> 02:08:22.702
Sure. I promise.

02:08:23.996 --> 02:08:28.958
Thank you very much.
I know it's not easy to do.

02:08:34.423 --> 02:08:38.092
But there are other things
I can do for you.

02:08:38.802 --> 02:08:41.929
Besides shoot me?
Yes. I can roll cigarettes

02:08:42.389 --> 02:08:47.435
when your box is empty.
Without spilling tobacco? Yes.

02:08:47.853 --> 02:08:52.732
And if you're wounded, I'll take care
of you, wash you and feed you.

02:08:53.108 --> 02:08:57.153
Maybe I won't be wounded.
If you're sick,

02:08:57.529 --> 02:09:02.324
I'll make soup and read to you.
Maybe I won't get sick.

02:09:02.701 --> 02:09:05.745
Then I'll bring you coffee.
Maybe I don't like coffee.

02:09:06.204 --> 02:09:10.166
This morning you had two cups.
Suppose I get tired of coffee,

02:09:10.625 --> 02:09:15.129
I'm not wounded or sick, I give up
smoking, have only one pair of socks,

02:09:15.589 --> 02:09:18.132
and roll up my robe myself.
What then?

02:09:18.550 --> 02:09:23.345
Then I'll cut your hair with Pilar's scissors.
I don't like that.

02:09:23.764 --> 02:09:28.017
Neither do I.
I like your hair the way it is.

02:09:30.020 --> 02:09:36.650
So if there's nothing to do for you,
I'll sit by you and watch you.

02:09:37.027 --> 02:09:39.820
And in the nights we'll make love.

02:09:43.784 --> 02:09:45.534
You are shameless.

02:09:45.994 --> 02:09:50.873
If you don't love me,
I love you enough for both.

02:10:30.038 --> 02:10:32.164
I was asleep.

02:10:34.251 --> 02:10:38.838
I'm sorry I woke up.
I didn't know I was sleeping.

02:10:39.297 --> 02:10:44.301
It was so beautiful in your house.
My house? Yes.

02:10:45.345 --> 02:10:49.598
In America. The one you told me about.
Where you were a little boy.

02:10:49.975 --> 02:10:53.018
Does the stairway turn at the top,
like this?

02:10:53.436 --> 02:10:57.523
And there is the door to your mother's
room? Yes, that's how it was.

02:10:57.983 --> 02:11:00.442
Your mother was there,
and your grandfather

02:11:00.902 --> 02:11:04.029
who fought in the American Civil War.
He's dead.

02:11:04.447 --> 02:11:08.659
He was there, just as you described
him. I liked him very much.

02:11:09.077 --> 02:11:11.704
And I loved your mother.

02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:17.376
She was holding a child
who looked exactly like my Roberto.

02:11:17.836 --> 02:11:23.257
When I asked her whose son it was,
she said, "Why, it's yours, María."

02:11:29.347 --> 02:11:33.309
That's why I had to look at you.
Maybe you weren't dreaming.

02:11:33.685 --> 02:11:37.730
No, I was there,
just as real as I'm here now.

02:11:38.106 --> 02:11:41.650
Can't you wait till I take you there?
Oh Roberto,

02:11:42.027 --> 02:11:46.030
that, too, is like a dream,
like a wonderful dream.

02:11:49.075 --> 02:11:53.621
My hair amuses you because it's odd.
But every day it's growing.

02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:57.875
And it will be long
and I will not look ugly.

02:11:58.335 --> 02:12:00.419
Perhaps you will love me very much.

02:12:05.008 --> 02:12:09.094
All the things you've told me tonight,
it's ... it's as if

02:12:09.471 --> 02:12:12.932
you'd already taken me to Madrid
and to America.

02:12:13.308 --> 02:12:16.352
That's just the beginning.
Wait till this war is over.

02:12:16.728 --> 02:12:19.980
Do I please you?
Will you always take me with you?

02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:25.152
Unless you run away from me.
No, I'll never go away from you.

02:12:25.612 --> 02:12:28.781
I loved you when I first saw you,

02:12:29.157 --> 02:12:32.326
I always have,
though I never saw you before.

02:12:32.786 --> 02:12:35.704
Now I'm your woman.
I'll always be your woman.

02:12:36.164 --> 02:12:37.289
Always!

02:12:43.463 --> 02:12:46.674
Where is the headquarters
of General Golz of the 35th division?

02:12:47.092 --> 02:12:50.010
Not here.
I was told he was in the vicinity. What is here?

02:12:50.470 --> 02:12:53.889
The comandancia.
Of what? Who are you?

02:12:54.266 --> 02:12:58.978
Captain Gómez of the 65th brigade
and I ask where is General Golz.

02:13:06.027 --> 02:13:09.530
I can hear the wind in the trees.

02:13:12.284 --> 02:13:14.827
Now it will soon be light.

02:13:17.038 --> 02:13:19.290
Will we ever come back?

02:13:22.085 --> 02:13:23.877
Some day, María.

02:13:26.298 --> 02:13:30.301
And stay here again?
Some day.

02:13:32.679 --> 02:13:36.098
Do you think Andrés got through?

02:13:36.558 --> 02:13:39.476
We can't tell until sunrise.

02:13:42.731 --> 02:13:44.440
Are you afraid?

02:13:45.483 --> 02:13:47.109
Not now.

02:13:48.987 --> 02:13:52.114
I love you, Roberto.
Always remember.

02:13:52.949 --> 02:13:56.243
I love you
as I love my father and mother,

02:13:56.619 --> 02:13:59.830
as I love our unborn children,

02:14:00.290 --> 02:14:04.168
as I love what I love most
in the world, and I love you more.

02:14:04.627 --> 02:14:06.587
Always remember.

02:14:06.963 --> 02:14:09.048
I'll remember.

02:14:10.592 --> 02:14:14.011
Nothing can ever part us now, can it?

02:14:14.387 --> 02:14:16.347
Nothing, María.

02:14:18.641 --> 02:14:20.351
Inglés!

02:14:21.936 --> 02:14:23.437
Inglés!

02:14:23.813 --> 02:14:26.648
What is it, Pilar? What's wrong?

02:14:27.025 --> 02:14:29.902
It must have been Pablo!
Pablo's gone. What do you mean?

02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:33.906
Your exploder!
The box that explodes the dynamite.

02:14:34.282 --> 02:14:37.868
When I stirred up the fire for coffee,
I found it.

02:14:38.244 --> 02:14:41.663
What?
It was under the ashes. I thought you were guarding it.

02:14:42.123 --> 02:14:44.333
I slept with your things!
You slept well!

02:14:44.709 --> 02:14:47.920
He must have done it last night
before we got back.

02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:51.215
Maybe it will work again.

02:14:54.302 --> 02:14:57.971
Is there no other way to explode the charges?
Yes, sure.

02:14:58.348 --> 02:15:01.308
A bad way, but I can do it.
That swine!

02:15:01.768 --> 02:15:05.771
What is the way, Inglés?
Get me your hand grenades.

02:15:26.251 --> 02:15:30.087
Do they always explode?
Yes, but not strong enough.

02:15:30.463 --> 02:15:34.341
I didn't ask that. Have they always exploded?
Always.

02:15:41.015 --> 02:15:46.687
I've brought 3 more men from the band of Elias.
Traitor.

02:15:49.149 --> 02:15:53.569
I've come back, Pilar, and I've
brought more men for the bridge.

02:15:55.155 --> 02:15:58.240
Did you do that?
I had a moment of weakness.

02:15:58.616 --> 02:16:00.617
Kill him, Inglés!

02:16:03.121 --> 02:16:05.122
Yes, I meant to leave.

02:16:05.582 --> 02:16:11.044
Having seen what happened to El Sordo,
I was afraid to die.

02:16:11.463 --> 02:16:16.258
But having done such a thing,
I was lonely.

02:16:16.676 --> 02:16:21.096
Do you understand loneliness?
I understand cowardice!

02:16:21.473 --> 02:16:25.726
Don't mock me, woman.
Don't you see I've come back?

02:16:28.021 --> 02:16:31.940
I've thought of a way
to explode the dynamite.

02:16:32.358 --> 02:16:34.066
So have I.

02:16:34.486 --> 02:16:38.572
The only reason I don't
shoot you is because we need you.

02:16:41.117 --> 02:16:45.077
I've brought more men
for the bridge, Inglés.

02:16:47.373 --> 02:16:52.794
They think I'm still the leader here.
Or they wouldn't have followed me.

02:16:58.175 --> 02:17:02.429
You are if you wish. For the fighting.

02:17:03.223 --> 02:17:08.393
I suppose when a man has something
once, always something remains.

02:17:09.437 --> 02:17:12.940
Our men are waiting below.
Tell them we're coming.

02:17:13.398 --> 02:17:17.653
Don't worry about the retreat.
Now we have three more horses.

02:17:18.029 --> 02:17:22.824
And three more men!
Maybe they won't need their horses.

02:17:35.171 --> 02:17:37.339
You have much control, Inglés.

02:17:38.216 --> 02:17:42.636
I'm glad he's back.
No matter what he is, we need him.

02:17:44.597 --> 02:17:48.808
One last thing I must tell you.
In that thing of the hand ...

02:17:49.184 --> 02:17:53.063
What thing of the hand?
No, listen. Don't be angry.

02:17:53.439 --> 02:17:56.358
When I looked in your hand,
it was just Gypsy humbug.

02:17:56.776 --> 02:18:00.611
Gypsies do that to make themselves important.
Sure, sure. Forget it.

02:18:01.030 --> 02:18:04.700
I don't want you to worry.
Who's worrying?

02:18:05.075 --> 02:18:09.913
The truth is, I saw only happiness
for you and the cropped head.

02:18:10.290 --> 02:18:14.959
I know that.
And I don't need a nurse.

02:18:15.335 --> 02:18:20.799
I care for you very much, Inglés.
Remember that and don't worry.

02:18:21.259 --> 02:18:24.928
Everything will go well at the bridge.
Sure. Let's go.

02:18:25.388 --> 02:18:27.431
Get your things together.

02:19:06.971 --> 02:19:10.182
Are the orders clear now?
Yes. Take the roadmender's hut,

02:19:10.642 --> 02:19:14.436
destroy the post and stop anything
from getting through to the bridge.

02:19:14.896 --> 02:19:18.607
Right. But not a move unless you hear the falling of bombs.
Yeah. Clear?

02:19:22.570 --> 02:19:27.907
You, Pilar, the same with the sawmill.
Don't shoot unless we hear the bombs.

02:19:28.368 --> 02:19:31.662
Don't alarm the sentries
unless you hear the bombs.

02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:36.249
Don't worry about the retreat, Inglés.
We'll have plenty of horses.

02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:39.252
Get along before he steals
the rest of your things.

02:19:39.712 --> 02:19:42.964
You don't understand me, woman.
We understand each other.

02:19:43.341 --> 02:19:47.386
Nobody understands you.
Neither God, nor your mother, nor I.

02:19:47.804 --> 02:19:50.055
Nor you, either.

02:19:56.688 --> 02:19:57.729
Come.

02:20:03.361 --> 02:20:06.279
Goodbye. See you soon.

02:20:06.739 --> 02:20:10.242
Goodbye, Roberto. Take much care.
Of course.

02:20:12.912 --> 02:20:14.454
Don't cry.

02:20:14.872 --> 02:20:18.583
No, I don't. But come back to me.
I will.

02:20:19.001 --> 02:20:21.628
Don't worry if you hear firing.

02:20:22.004 --> 02:20:24.589
Only come back quickly.

02:20:25.717 --> 02:20:27.592
Bye, María.

02:20:28.636 --> 02:20:30.554
Salud, Roberto.

02:21:54.764 --> 02:21:57.808
Get across the gorge
and don't fire unless I do.

02:21:58.267 --> 02:22:01.478
When the sentry is eliminated,
come to the middle of the bridge.

02:22:01.854 --> 02:22:03.897
It is all clear to me.

02:22:05.525 --> 02:22:08.485
I will do as you order.

02:22:11.322 --> 02:22:16.409
When you fire, don't think of it
as a man, but as a target.

02:22:16.828 --> 02:22:20.413
And if anything happens to me,
you'll have to finish the job

02:22:20.790 --> 02:22:23.708
as I showed you.
Go now.

02:22:24.502 --> 02:22:28.630
Until soon, Roberto.
Until soon, Anselmo.

02:24:24.163 --> 02:24:28.458
Captain Gómez, 65th brigade.
An urgent dispatch for General Golz.

02:24:28.918 --> 02:24:34.130
Why didn't this get here sooner?
Stupidity and crazy suspicion.

02:24:34.799 --> 02:24:39.386
General Golz! Urgent!
But I just spoke to him.

02:24:39.804 --> 02:24:42.931
Segovia? I'll try there.

02:25:50.958 --> 02:25:54.502
No, no, no!
Get me position Ávila!

02:25:55.588 --> 02:25:57.672
Where's General Golz?

02:25:58.716 --> 02:26:00.300
Planes 1?

02:26:02.178 --> 02:26:04.429
Get me Planes 1 !
Can't you call the airfield?

02:26:04.889 --> 02:26:07.140
General Golz! Not there?

02:26:08.309 --> 02:26:10.727
I called Segovia!

02:26:13.022 --> 02:26:17.108
Get me Segovia again! Quick, man!
Stop the bombardment!

02:26:17.568 --> 02:26:19.527
You think I want to get shot?

02:26:47.431 --> 02:26:51.518
Yes, Golz. Golz! General Golz?

02:26:52.436 --> 02:26:55.271
From Jordan? Yes, read it.

02:26:57.525 --> 02:26:58.566
What?

02:27:08.619 --> 02:27:10.036
Too late, Ouval!

02:27:10.454 --> 02:27:15.166
That means we're done for.
This time we fail.

02:27:15.543 --> 02:27:17.043
Too bad.

02:27:17.419 --> 02:27:20.964
Yes, too bad.

02:29:39.895 --> 02:29:41.187
Rope!

02:29:58.289 --> 02:30:00.164
Hand grenade.

02:30:33.115 --> 02:30:34.949
Other side!

02:30:49.173 --> 02:30:53.092
Please have him be all right
because all my heart is at the bridge.

02:30:55.262 --> 02:31:00.099
Please bring him back to me,
and I'll do anything you say, ever.

02:31:02.603 --> 02:31:06.314
Because there isn't any me.
I'm only with him.

02:31:06.732 --> 02:31:12.070
Please take care of him for me.
Take care of him!

02:31:15.032 --> 02:31:18.951
Forgive me, for I'm very confused ...

02:31:19.411 --> 02:31:22.330
but if you take care of him,
I'll do whatever is right.

02:31:22.790 --> 02:31:26.084
But this not knowing,
I cannot endure it.

02:32:31.233 --> 02:32:35.027
Pablo, I got me a ... a tank!

02:33:03.891 --> 02:33:06.058
One.
Two. Three.

02:33:06.602 --> 02:33:07.643
Four!

02:33:33.670 --> 02:33:36.923
Alright. Now take the wire back
as far as it will reach

02:33:37.382 --> 02:33:39.258
before I connect it.

02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:27.682
Roberto!

02:34:34.273 --> 02:34:36.232
Hurry, Roberto!

02:34:46.493 --> 02:34:48.160
Hurry!

02:34:53.792 --> 02:34:57.795
Blow it, Anselmo!
No, I can't! You'll be ...

02:34:58.547 --> 02:35:01.966
Pull it, I tell you!
No, Roberto!

02:35:52.809 --> 02:35:55.436
María! María!

02:35:55.812 --> 02:35:57.980
Your Inglés is alright.

02:35:58.440 --> 02:36:01.400
Hear me? He's alright.

02:36:01.777 --> 02:36:04.820
Yes, thank you. Thank you.

02:36:06.865 --> 02:36:09.241
Thank you very much.

02:36:19.753 --> 02:36:21.504
Roberto!

02:36:46.196 --> 02:36:49.448
The old one?
Dead.

02:36:49.825 --> 02:36:54.870
We lost Fernando.
If I'd had only had the exploder.

02:36:55.288 --> 02:36:59.041
What's with Pablo?
Maybe he can't leave.

02:36:59.459 --> 02:37:04.004
Then let us leave! The devil with him!
Wait! He'll be back if he's able.

02:37:17.310 --> 02:37:18.436
Machine gun.

02:37:20.272 --> 02:37:21.355
Here comes the ...

02:37:26.361 --> 02:37:28.946
Plenty of horses now, Inglés!

02:37:33.326 --> 02:37:35.494
Where's Fernando?

02:37:35.912 --> 02:37:37.997
And the old man?

02:37:39.458 --> 02:37:41.584
Where are the three men of Elias?

02:37:44.504 --> 02:37:48.174
What were you shooting in the gorge?

02:37:49.217 --> 02:37:53.345
Why don't you say you shot them?
Shut up! Answer me!

02:37:53.805 --> 02:37:55.681
I look after my own people.

02:37:56.141 --> 02:37:59.685
And the men of Elias?
They were not our people.

02:38:00.145 --> 02:38:03.522
I provide horses for my people!
We have horses to spare.

02:38:03.899 --> 02:38:07.818
Yeah? How did I know
we would have three killed!

02:38:08.236 --> 02:38:12.907
Now, shut up!
I lead the retreat.

02:38:34.888 --> 02:38:36.722
No!
Don't be stubborn, woman.

02:38:37.098 --> 02:38:40.434
Watch the María.
Watch yourself.

02:38:46.107 --> 02:38:48.025
Look! There they are!

02:39:28.400 --> 02:39:33.028
Wait for the next shot, then go hard before they can reload.
No.

02:39:34.990 --> 02:39:36.907
Now!
No!

02:40:11.443 --> 02:40:12.735
Roberto!

02:40:16.823 --> 02:40:19.825
Roberto! Let me go!

02:40:25.665 --> 02:40:27.249
Roberto!

02:40:30.545 --> 02:40:34.465
What is it? Is it ...
It's broken. Can you ride?

02:40:36.551 --> 02:40:40.679
Get me a strip of canvas. Tear it from one of the packs.
Yes.

02:40:44.434 --> 02:40:47.770
Get me the machine gun.
You can make it if I hold 'em here.

02:40:48.229 --> 02:40:49.855
No, Inglés. We'll carry you.

02:40:50.315 --> 02:40:53.984
Don't argue. I can't ride. I couldn't
even sit on a horse. I'd ...

02:40:54.444 --> 02:40:57.237
I'd pass out.
Pablo know I'm right.

02:40:57.989 --> 02:41:03.243
I want to talk to María alone.
But when I tell you to take her, do it.

02:41:03.703 --> 02:41:07.623
Talk fast, Inglés.
The soldiers will soon be coming.

02:41:15.924 --> 02:41:19.635
María, listen, don't say anything.

02:41:20.011 --> 02:41:22.471
We won't be going
to America this time.

02:41:22.847 --> 02:41:27.101
But always I go with you
wherever you go. Understand?

02:41:27.560 --> 02:41:30.604
You go now, María.
No, I stay with you, Roberto.

02:41:31.064 --> 02:41:35.150
No, María.
What I do now, I do alone.

02:41:35.527 --> 02:41:40.864
No. - If you go, then I go too.
Whichever one there is, is both.

02:41:41.324 --> 02:41:45.119
No. No, I stay with you.
No,

02:41:45.578 --> 02:41:48.205
each of us must do this thing alone.

02:41:49.290 --> 02:41:53.127
Do it for each other.
But if you go, then I go with you.

02:41:53.545 --> 02:41:57.923
That way I go too. I know you'll go
now, María, for both of us,

02:41:58.299 --> 02:42:01.510
because we love each other always.

02:42:01.970 --> 02:42:05.806
It's easier for me
to stay with you, Roberto.

02:42:06.266 --> 02:42:10.978
I know it's harder for you.
But now I am you also.

02:42:11.438 --> 02:42:15.816
If you go, I go too.
That's the only way I can go.

02:42:16.192 --> 02:42:19.528
You're me now.
Surely you must feel that, María.

02:42:20.572 --> 02:42:25.367
Remember last night? Our time is "now"
and it'll never end.

02:42:26.327 --> 02:42:29.371
No.
You're me now and I am you.

02:42:31.041 --> 02:42:34.585
Now you understand. Now you're going.

02:42:34.961 --> 02:42:37.171
You're going well and fast and far.

02:42:37.630 --> 02:42:40.424
We'll go to America
another time, María.

02:42:40.884 --> 02:42:43.010
Stand up now and go. And we both go.

02:42:43.386 --> 02:42:46.180
Stand up.
Remember, you're me too.

02:42:46.556 --> 02:42:49.808
You're all there will be ever be of me
now. Stand up.

02:42:53.563 --> 02:42:55.814
No. Stand up.

02:43:03.990 --> 02:43:07.743
There's no goodbye, María,
because we're not apart.

02:43:08.119 --> 02:43:09.203
Pilar!

02:43:15.418 --> 02:43:16.877
Don't turn around.

02:43:17.337 --> 02:43:19.421
Go now. Be strong.

02:43:19.798 --> 02:43:22.007
Take care of our life.

02:43:29.474 --> 02:43:31.725
No, Pilar, I can't go!

02:43:32.102 --> 02:43:34.436
No! Oh Roberto!

02:43:34.896 --> 02:43:39.399
Roberto, let me stay, please!
Please don't make me go!

02:43:43.363 --> 02:43:46.073
No, Roberto, no!

02:43:57.293 --> 02:44:02.631
God,
that was lucky I could make her go.

02:44:03.675 --> 02:44:07.136
I don't mind this at all now.
They're away.

02:44:08.805 --> 02:44:13.559
Think how it would be
if they'd got María instead of you.

02:44:14.686 --> 02:44:17.146
Don't pass out, Jordan.

02:44:18.690 --> 02:44:20.566
Think about America.

02:44:21.025 --> 02:44:22.609
I can't.

02:44:23.069 --> 02:44:25.237
Think about Madrid.

02:44:25.613 --> 02:44:26.947
I can't.

02:44:27.365 --> 02:44:29.783
Think about María.

02:44:32.787 --> 02:44:33.912
I can do that.

02:44:49.679 --> 02:44:54.892
No, you fool! You weren't kidding
María about that talk of "now"!

02:44:55.351 --> 02:45:00.647
Now they can't stop us, ever!
She's going on with me! Yes! Right!
