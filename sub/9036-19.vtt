I'M LOOKING FOR
KRISTI YAMAGUCHI.

00:09.210 --> 00:12.113
OH, THANK YOU.

HI, UH, KRISTI.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.589
DO YOU MIND DOING
THE INTERVIEW IN HERE?

00:21.622 --> 00:23.457
- NO, NO, NO, NO!

00:23.491 --> 00:25.059
IT'S JUST--
IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.

00:25.093 --> 00:27.461
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN
A WOMEN'S LOCKER ROOM BEFORE.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.297
ONCE, IN SEVENTH GRADE,
THE GUYS PUSHED ME IN,

00:29.330 --> 00:31.199
BUT THAT WAS ONLY
FOR A SECOND.

00:33.534 --> 00:38.106
ALL RIGHT, UH--
I'LL JUST SIT HERE.

00:38.139 --> 00:39.240
WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S BEEN A BIG DEAL

00:39.273 --> 00:42.376
FOR FEMALE REPORTERS GOING
IN THE MALE LOCKER ROOMS,

00:42.410 --> 00:45.146
I'M JUST GETTING TO KNOW
HOW THEY MUST FEEL NOW.

00:45.179 --> 00:47.715
OH, OKAY,
SO LET'S JUST START--

00:47.748 --> 00:50.651
UH, KRISTI,
OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL,

00:50.684 --> 00:52.420
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP,

00:52.453 --> 00:54.855
THE COVER OF

00:54.888 --> 00:56.190
WHAT'S NEXT FOR YOU?

01:00.728 --> 01:02.130
UNH!

01:02.163 --> 01:03.664
OH, YOU HAVE AN OUTIE,

01:03.697 --> 01:06.066
I WOULD'VE TAKEN YOU
FOR IN INNIE.

01:11.272 --> 01:12.340
HI, I'M RAY,

01:12.373 --> 01:13.607
AND I LIVE HERE
IN LONG ISLAND

01:13.641 --> 01:15.309
WITH MY WIFE, DEBRA.

01:15.343 --> 01:16.544
SHE'S GREAT
WITH THE KIDS,

01:16.577 --> 01:18.679
THE HOUSE,
EVERYTHING.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.581
OH, I DON'T KNOW
HOW SHE DOES IT.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.216
WE'VE GOT
A DAUGHTER, ALLY,

01:22.250 --> 01:25.686
AND TWIN
TWO-YEAR-OLD BOYS.

01:25.719 --> 01:28.122
IT'S NOT REALLY
ABOUT THE KIDS.

01:28.156 --> 01:30.724
MY PARENTS LIVE
ACROSS THE STREET.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.560
THAT'S RIGHT,

01:32.593 --> 01:35.629
AND MY BROTHER
LIVES WITH THEM.

01:35.663 --> 01:36.564
NOW, NOT EVERY FAMILY

01:36.597 --> 01:38.766
WOULD GO BY
ON A CONVEYER BELT FOR YOU,

01:38.799 --> 01:40.468
BUT MINE WOULD,
BECAUSE--

01:40.501 --> 01:42.670
- EVERYBODY
LOVES RAYMOND.

01:42.703 --> 01:45.173
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

01:48.576 --> 01:51.645
- HEY!

01:51.679 --> 01:53.847
HEY, ANYBODY HOME?
DEBRA!

01:53.881 --> 01:56.350
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, BUDDY.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.221
HEY, HEY!

02:00.254 --> 02:01.855
AW, ARE YOU NERVOUS?
DON'T BE NERVOUS.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.724
THEY'RE GOING TO LOVE YOU.

02:03.757 --> 02:04.925
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,

02:04.958 --> 02:06.794
I'LL DO ALL THE TALKING,
OKAY?

02:06.827 --> 02:09.363
COME HERE. COME HERE.
DID YOU EAT YET?

02:09.397 --> 02:10.764
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

02:10.798 --> 02:12.700
LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.535
LASAGNA.

02:14.568 --> 02:15.536
BAKED BEANS.

02:15.569 --> 02:16.537
CHICKEN LO MEIN.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.606
HOLD ON.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.708
THIS IS DEBRA'S
MEATLOAF.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.210
HERE.
DO ME A FAVOR.

02:27.681 --> 02:28.749
- RAY!

02:28.782 --> 02:30.218
HAVE YOU SEEN
GEOFFREY?

02:30.251 --> 02:31.552
- NO.

02:35.223 --> 02:36.590
BUT LOOK, A DOG.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.261
- YEAH.
I SEE THAT, RAY.

02:40.294 --> 02:41.895
WHY IS HE HERE
EATING MY MEATLOAF?

02:41.929 --> 02:42.930
- BECAUSE--

02:42.963 --> 02:46.700
IT'S SO GOOD.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.336
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH A DOG, RAY?

02:48.369 --> 02:49.537
- HE FOLLOWED ME HOME.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.672
YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH HIM?
GO AHEAD.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.441
- PLAY WITH HIM?
RAY, I CAN'T EVEN FIND

02:53.474 --> 02:54.675
ONE OF OUR OWN CHILDREN,
ALL RIGHT?

02:54.708 --> 02:56.344
GEOFFREY!

02:56.377 --> 02:58.512
- THAT'S 'CAUSE
THEY'RE WALKING NOW.

02:58.546 --> 03:01.682
I TOLD YOU ALL THAT CRAWLING
WOULD LEAD TO NO GOOD.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.751
- HERE HE IS.
I GOT HIM.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.919
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, HUH?
WHAT SHOULD WE NAME HIM?

03:05.953 --> 03:06.920
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

03:06.954 --> 03:08.356
RAY, WE CAN'T KEEP HIM.

03:08.389 --> 03:09.890
BESIDES,
HE BELONGS TO SOMEBODY.

03:09.923 --> 03:12.560
- NO, THERE'S NO TAG,
NO COLLAR.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.362
HE COULD'VE BEEN
BORN IN THE WILD.

03:15.729 --> 03:19.667
- YEAH, THOSE HERDS
OF WILD BULLDOGS.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.834
- I THOUGHT YOU LIKED DOGS.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.803
- RAY, COME ON.
I LOVE DOGS.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.272
BUT IN CASE
YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,

03:24.305 --> 03:25.739
THE LAST THING
THAT WE NEED AROUND HERE

03:25.773 --> 03:28.709
IS SOMETHING ELSE
THAT EATS AND POOPS.

03:30.644 --> 03:33.213
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL STOP
DOING ONE OF THOSE.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.549
- DOG. COME ON.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.585
ALLY, IT'S DINNERTIME,
HONEY!

03:37.618 --> 03:39.387
- HEY, SEE, FOR THE KIDS
IT'D BE GREAT, A PET.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.721
- ALLY ALREADY
HAS A HAMSTER.

03:40.754 --> 03:41.922
DON'T USE THAT.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.424
- OH, A HAMSTER.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.926
COME ON, YOU CAN'T
PLAY CATCH WITH A HAMSTER.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.528
WELL, YOU CAN,

03:47.561 --> 03:49.730
BUT THE HAMSTER DOESN'T
LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.001
- WHAT'S THAT?

03:54.034 --> 03:55.636
- LOOK, SWEETIE,
IT'S A DOGGY.

03:55.669 --> 03:56.837
ISN'T HE GREAT?

03:56.870 --> 03:58.472
- HE SMELLS.

04:01.642 --> 04:04.478
- SHE SAYS THAT ABOUT THE TWINS,
AND WE KEEP THEM.

04:06.514 --> 04:07.615
- RAY, YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.717
COME ON, WHY WOULD
YOU WANT A DOG NOW?

04:09.750 --> 04:12.686
- I--NOT A DOG--
THIS DOG.

04:12.720 --> 04:13.521
WHEN I WAS FIVE,

04:13.554 --> 04:16.990
I HAD A BULLDOG
JUST LIKE THIS GUY.

04:17.024 --> 04:20.928
MY BROTHER GOT IT
FOR HIS FIRST COMMUNION.

04:20.961 --> 04:21.762
- A BULLDOG?

04:21.795 --> 04:24.832
- YEAH, IT WAS
A PERSONALITY THING.

04:24.865 --> 04:25.899
OH, ROBERT LOVED
THAT DOG.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.602
HE NAMED HIM SHAMSKY AFTER
HIS FAVORITE BALLPLAYER.

04:28.636 --> 04:29.603
- ART SHAMSKY.

04:29.637 --> 04:30.771
- RIGHT, RIGHT.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.506
OH, YEAH.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.309
SHAMSKY WAS GREAT.

04:35.343 --> 04:36.944
ONCE, WE DRESSED HIM
IN MOM'S NIGHTGOWN

04:36.977 --> 04:38.879
WITH A WIG AND LIPSTICK.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.581
OHH--

04:40.614 --> 04:43.751
MY MOM CAME HOME, AND DAD
WAS DANCING WITH HIM.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.454
OH, IT WAS CRAZY.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.021
SHAMSKY.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.090
AND THEN WE HAD
TO GIVE HIM AWAY.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.992
- YEAH? WHY IS THAT?

04:52.025 --> 04:53.761
- I HAD ALLERGIES.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.399
I DON'T HAVE ALLERGIES
ANYMORE.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.534
- RAY, HE'S NOT OUR DOG.

05:03.704 --> 05:04.905
[sighs]

05:04.938 --> 05:05.906
ALL RIGHT,
WE CAN KEEP HIM

05:05.939 --> 05:07.341
UNTIL WE FIND
THE OWNER, OKAY?

05:07.375 --> 05:09.577
- YEAH! YEAH, YEAH!

05:09.610 --> 05:10.878
- BUT WE'RE GOING TO
PUT OUT FLYERS

05:10.911 --> 05:11.979
AND TAKE AN AD OUT
IN THE PAPER AND ALL THAT.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.514
- I'LL DO IT.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.616
I'LL DO EVERYTHING, OKAY?
I PROMISE.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.351
YOU WON'T HAVE TO DO
ANYTHING.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.420
YOU JUST ENJOY HIM.

05:30.631 --> 05:34.502
[chew toy squeaking]
- RAY.

05:35.769 --> 05:36.837
RAY.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.740
- EH, GO AROUND ME.
GO AROUND ME.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.141
HUH? WHAT?

05:41.174 --> 05:43.043
- THAT NOISE
IS DRIVING ME NUTS.

05:43.076 --> 05:46.380
- ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SLEEP ON MY SIDE. SORRY.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.083
- RAY, THE DOG.
[chew toy squeaking]

05:50.117 --> 05:51.952
IT'S THAT STUPID TOY
YOU GAVE HIM.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.455
- ALL RIGHT.
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

05:54.488 --> 05:55.723
I'M ON IT.
DON'T WORRY.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.858
IT'S JUST HIS FIRST
NIGHT HERE, THAT'S ALL.

05:57.891 --> 06:00.360
REMEMBER HOW YOU WERE
ON OUR FIRST NIGHT?

06:03.464 --> 06:05.098
COME ON, BOY.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.900
COME ON,
GIVE ME THE TOY.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.035
COME ON, GIVE ME THE TOY.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.036
GIVE ME THE TOY, BOY.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.871
COME ON.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.507
ALL RIGHT, THIS OBVIOUSLY
ISN'T ABOUT THE TOY, IS IT?

06:13.541 --> 06:15.743
COME ON,
THERE'S SOME DEEPER ISSUES HERE.

06:15.776 --> 06:16.744
GIVE ME THE--

06:16.777 --> 06:17.511
[toy squeaks]

06:19.947 --> 06:21.048
I GOT IT!

06:22.115 --> 06:23.817
OKAY.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.052
ALL RIGHT.

06:25.085 --> 06:28.656
GOOD DOGGY.
GOOD DOGGY.

06:28.689 --> 06:29.890
[toy squeaks]

06:29.923 --> 06:31.825
WHEW. SEE?
THAT'S ALL.

06:31.859 --> 06:35.763
NO BIG DEAL.
NO BIG DEAL.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.499
HE JUST NEEDS
A LITTLE LOVE, THAT'S ALL.

06:38.532 --> 06:41.034
THAT'S ALL ANYBODY NEEDS--
A LITTLE LOVE.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.707
[barking and
scraping at door]

06:46.740 --> 06:49.843
- RAY, YOUR LOVER
IS AT THE DOOR.

06:49.877 --> 06:50.878
- JUST--YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:50.911 --> 06:53.847
JUST KEEP QUIET.
HE'LL CALM DOWN.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.048
SEE?

06:55.082 --> 06:56.850
AW, THAT'S A GOOD DOGGY.

06:58.686 --> 07:01.722
WHEW. WHEW.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.057
- MOMMY! MOMMY!

07:08.929 --> 07:09.897
- WE'RE RICH.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.632
THE DOG CAN TALK.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.240
- YES, YES,
WE MIGHT HAVE YOUR DOG.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.976
YEAH, WHAT KIND IS IT?

07:23.010 --> 07:24.678
OH, A COLLIE.

07:24.712 --> 07:27.047
- HA, HA!

07:27.080 --> 07:28.048
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:28.081 --> 07:30.584
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
THIS DOG?

07:30.618 --> 07:32.219
YEAH, BECAUSE
HE'S VERY SMART.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.722
MAYBE HE COULD HELP
FIND YOUR DOG.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.558
NO, OKAY.

07:37.591 --> 07:38.592
WELL, THANKS ANYWAY.

07:38.626 --> 07:39.593
YEAH. BYE-BYE.

07:39.627 --> 07:40.861
- HA! THAT'S IT.

07:40.894 --> 07:43.063
THAT'S ALL.
NO MORE CALLS.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.498
WE HAVE A WINNER.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.033
- WE HAVEN'T SLEPT
IN THREE NIGHTS.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.235
YOU KNOW WHY THE OWNERS
HAVEN'T SHOWED UP?

07:48.268 --> 07:51.171
BECAUSE
THEY'RE ASLEEP, RAY.

07:52.239 --> 07:53.807
WE CAN'T KEEP HIM.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.677
- I LOVE HIM.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.650
I LOVE HIM LIKE--

08:02.683 --> 08:05.553
AN INCREDIBLY UGLY SON.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.722
- LISTEN, RAY,
I UNDERSTAND.

08:08.756 --> 08:09.923
BELIEVE ME. I DO.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.025
BUT, I MEAN,
THINK ABOUT IT, HONEY.

08:12.059 --> 08:14.762
I'M--I'M JUST SWAMPED
AS IT IS, YOU KNOW?

08:14.795 --> 08:16.964
UH, MAYBE WHEN THE KIDS
ARE A LITTLE BIT OLDER.

08:16.997 --> 08:17.898
[knock on door]

08:17.931 --> 08:19.232
- HELLO.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.837
YOU GUYS HAVE
ANY MAALOX OR SOMETHING?

08:25.773 --> 08:28.041
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, ROBERT,
DID YOU EAT SOMETHING BAD?

08:28.075 --> 08:28.976
- I'M A COP,
AND I LIVE WITH MY PARENTS.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.745
I'M ON A STEADY DIET
OF HUMAN SUFFERING.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.864
WHOSE DOG?

08:52.966 --> 08:54.101
- I FOUND HIM.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.202
- BUT WE'RE GETTING RID
OF HIM.

08:55.235 --> 08:58.138
- OH?

08:58.171 --> 08:59.239
- ROBERT?

08:59.272 --> 09:01.141
- IT'S JUST THAT HE--

09:01.174 --> 09:02.776
LOOKS SO FAMILIAR.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.645
- GET HIM THE MAALOX.
GO GET HIM THE MAALOX, DEBRA.

09:04.678 --> 09:07.180
- HELLO, PUPPY.

09:07.214 --> 09:11.852
HELLO, PUPPY.
OH, YEAH.

09:11.885 --> 09:15.723
WHERE'D YOU LEARN
TO KISS LIKE THAT, HUH?

09:17.958 --> 09:18.926
- WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

09:18.959 --> 09:20.060
- YOU HEARD ME.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.029
- NO, I'M NOT
GIVING ROBERT MY DOG.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.632
- RAY, IT'S A PERFECT MATCH;
HE NEEDS A DOG.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.834
AND WE NEED
NOT TO HAVE A DOG.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.202
- I WANT TO HAVE A DOG.
COME ON. WE BONDED.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.871
WE HAVE SOMETHING
SPECIAL.

09:30.904 --> 09:31.571
- WHAT, MORE SPECIAL
THAN THAT?

09:31.605 --> 09:35.609
- OH, GIVE DADDY
SOME SUGAR.

09:35.643 --> 09:37.144
[growling playfully]

09:40.881 --> 09:42.816
- HE'S PROBABLY PICKING UP
MY SCENT ON ROBERT.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.217
- NO. LISTEN,
THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.286
GIVE THIS DOG TO ROBERT.

09:46.319 --> 09:48.922
- I DON'T WANT TO
GIVE ROBERT MY DOG, COME ON.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.958
- GOT A HELL OF A DOG HERE,
RAYMOND.

09:50.991 --> 09:51.959
- YEAH.

09:51.992 --> 09:54.161
- KNOW WHO
HE REMINDS ME OF?

09:54.194 --> 09:56.697
SHAMSKY.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.198
- OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
SHAMSKY. YEAH.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.801
- HE WAS A HELL OF A POOCH,
WASN'T HE?

10:00.834 --> 10:03.070
USED TO FOLLOW ME
EVERYWHERE.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.305
THEN ONE DAY, I CAME HOME
FROM SCHOOL

10:05.338 --> 10:07.841
AND SHAMSKY WASN'T THERE.

10:07.875 --> 10:10.143
OF COURSE MOM TRIED
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.112
SHE TOLD ME
HE GOT HIT BY A CAR.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.383
BUT I KNEW
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.319
WELL, THAT--
THAT'S OKAY, RAYMOND.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.822
I'M NOT BLAMING YOU.

10:21.855 --> 10:25.025
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
YOU HAD ALLERGIES.

10:26.994 --> 10:29.096
- YEAH, WELL, I DON'T HAVE
ALLERGIES ANYMORE.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.199
HEY, GIVE ME SOME SUGAR,
TOO, THERE, HUH?

10:32.232 --> 10:33.934
H-HEY.

10:33.967 --> 10:34.935
HE'S COOL, ISN'T HE?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.036
- OH, YEAH. HE'S GREAT.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.071
YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN,
RAYMOND.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.840
[choked up]
LUCKY MAN.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.344
YOU KNOW,
IT'S A FUNNY THING,

10:44.377 --> 10:47.114
BUT TO THIS DAY, I CAN'T
EVEN LOOK AT A LIVER SNAP

10:47.147 --> 10:49.149
WITHOUT GETTING
ALL CHOKED UP.

10:53.353 --> 10:54.688
- ROBERT, WAIT.

10:54.722 --> 10:55.923
- WHAT?

10:58.058 --> 10:59.960
- HERE, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE THE DOG?

11:04.097 --> 11:05.966
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

11:05.999 --> 11:06.934
YOU MEAN, YOU'D WANT ME
TO HAVE HIM?

11:06.967 --> 11:08.035
- YEAH, WELL,
HE LIKES YOU.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.069
WE CAN'T HAVE A DOG.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.805
WE GOT A HAMSTER.
HE'S NUTS.

11:11.839 --> 11:14.107
HE LIKES YOU.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.477
- NO, NO.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.280
NO, I'D JUST BE SETTING MYSELF
UP FOR MORE HURT.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.715
YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME
I GET ATTACHED TO SOMETHING,

11:21.749 --> 11:23.450
I JUST GET BURNED, YOU KNOW?

11:23.483 --> 11:25.352
FIRST DOG.
MY FIRST WIFE.

11:25.385 --> 11:28.355
MY FIRST LAWYER
AFTER MY FIRST WIFE.

11:28.388 --> 11:29.723
- YEAH.
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

11:29.757 --> 11:31.224
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
IF THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL--

11:31.258 --> 11:33.360
- OH, YEAH, THAT'S HOW I FEEL.
I APPRECIATE IT.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.266
AW, WHAT THE HELL.
LIFE'S TOO SHORT.

11:39.299 --> 11:40.233
COME ON, BOY!

11:40.267 --> 11:42.002
COME ON!

11:42.035 --> 11:43.103
HELLO, GORGEOUS.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.104
YES.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.305
OH, YES.

11:45.338 --> 11:46.473
[inaudible]

11:56.884 --> 11:58.952
- HEY.
- HEY.

11:58.986 --> 12:01.221
- THEY'RE ALL ASLEEP.
THIS IS FROM THE KIDS.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.256
- HEY.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.792
HOW ABOUT FROM YOU?

12:04.825 --> 12:07.127
- HASN'T COME IN YET.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.096
- HEY, HEY, HEY.
WHAT'S THIS?

12:09.129 --> 12:11.298
- OH, THAT'S A GIFT
FROM YOUR BROTHER.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.500
- ROBERT GAVE ME
A PRESENT?

12:13.533 --> 12:14.768
WOW. LOOK AT THIS.

12:14.802 --> 12:16.837
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S A TITLEIST PUTTER.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.038
- YEAH, ISN'T THAT SWEET?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.239
YOU KNOW, SINCE YOU
GAVE HIM THAT DOG,

12:19.272 --> 12:21.374
HE'S A DIFFERENT PERSON.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.010
- A BETTER PERSON.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.079
- YOU DID
A VERY GOOD THING, RAY.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.314
- MMM. YEAH.

12:27.347 --> 12:28.515
YOU KNOW, IT'S ALWAYS
KIND OF BOTHERED ME

12:28.548 --> 12:31.952
THAT ROBERT HAD TO GIVE AWAY
HIS FIRST DOG BECAUSE OF ME.

12:31.985 --> 12:34.054
FEELS GOOD
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.423
DID HE DROP ANY BALLS OFF
WITH THIS?

12:36.456 --> 12:39.459
[knocking]

12:39.492 --> 12:41.461
YEAH, HUH?

12:41.494 --> 12:42.863
HI.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.197
- HELLO.

12:44.231 --> 12:45.866
- CAN I HELP YOU?

12:45.899 --> 12:48.035
- I BELIEVE
YOU HAVE MY DOG.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.013
- YOUR DOG?

13:00.047 --> 13:01.081
- PHYLLIS?

13:01.114 --> 13:02.315
- DEBRA!

13:02.349 --> 13:04.317
I CAN'T
BELIEVE THIS.

13:04.351 --> 13:05.518
- YOU KNOW HER?

13:05.552 --> 13:06.987
- YEAH, RAY,
THIS IS PHYLLIS

13:07.020 --> 13:08.055
FROM THE SALON
WHERE I GET MY HAIR CUT.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.356
SHE SHAMPOOS ME.

13:09.389 --> 13:12.359
- YEAH, YEAH, GREAT, GREAT.
IT'S VERY FLUFFY.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.261
- SO THIS IS YOUR DOG?

13:14.294 --> 13:16.363
- I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW UPSET I'VE BEEN.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.431
I LEFT TOWN
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS

13:18.465 --> 13:21.534
AND CAME BACK TO FIND THAT
THE GARDENER HAD LET HIM OUT.

13:21.568 --> 13:24.504
YOU KNOW,
HE'S A PRIZE-WINNING STUD.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.073
- I'M SURPRISED
HE HAS TO WORK AS A GARDENER.

13:26.106 --> 13:29.376
- THE DOG, RAY.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.945
- HE'S A GREAT CHAMPION.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.614
I'VE BEEN BREEDING HIM
FOR YEARS.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.083
WHERE IS HE?

13:36.116 --> 13:38.218
- UH, COME HERE.
COME ON IN, PHYLLIS.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.219
COME ON IN HERE.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.287
MAYBE I CAN
EXPLAIN THIS.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.522
- EXPLAIN WHAT?

13:42.555 --> 13:44.257
WHERE'S BARON?
IS HE ALL RIGHT?

13:44.291 --> 13:48.195
- NO, NO, NO.
HE'S FINE, HE'S FINE, HE'S FINE.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.330
UH, LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

13:50.363 --> 13:53.633
DO YOU KNOW THE BALLPLAYER
ART SHAMSKY?

13:53.666 --> 13:56.003
- ART SHAMSKY
HAS MY DOG?

13:56.036 --> 13:57.204
- NO.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.139
NO, NO, NO.
HE'S RETIRED.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.908
BUT MY BROTHER--
- RAY.

14:00.941 --> 14:01.608
YOUR DOG'S
JUST ACROSS THE STREET

14:01.641 --> 14:02.943
PLAYING WITH
RAY'S BROTHER.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.211
WE'RE GOING TO GET HIM
RIGHT BACK.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.445
- RIGHT BACK?

14:05.478 --> 14:07.180
- YES. HERE,
HAVE A SEAT, PHYLLIS.

14:07.214 --> 14:08.481
YEAH, WE'LL GO GET HIM BACK.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.918
RAY WAS JUST ON HIS WAY
OVER THERE NOW.

14:13.620 --> 14:16.223
- HOW CAN I DO THIS
TO ROBERT AGAIN?

14:16.256 --> 14:17.958
- I KNOW,
BUT LOOK AT HER, RAY.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.960
SHE'S WAITING
FOR HER DOG, OKAY?

14:19.993 --> 14:21.528
IT'S HER WHOLE LIFE.

14:21.561 --> 14:24.297
YOU GOT TO GO
GET THE DOG NOW.

14:24.331 --> 14:25.999
- HE GAVE ME A PUTTER.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.441
- WAIT TILL YOU SEE
THESE TOYS I GOT FOR THAT DOG.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.209
- I ALREADY BOUGHT HIM
SOME TODAY.

14:36.243 --> 14:40.180
- YEAH? DID YOU GET HIM
THE CHEWY PHONE?

14:40.213 --> 14:42.382
- THOSE PHONES
ARE A WASTE OF MONEY.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.317
I GOT HIM
THE SQUEAKY HYDRANT.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.518
- PLEASE.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.620
PLEASE,
THERE'S NO COMPARISON.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.256
- YOU KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT DOGS.

14:49.289 --> 14:50.623
LOOK AT THIS.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.559
[barking]

14:52.592 --> 14:54.027
FUN! THIS IS FUN!

14:54.061 --> 14:55.028
- OH, PLEASE.

14:55.062 --> 14:58.398
COME ON, LET GO OF THAT.
LET GO. FRANK, COME ON.

14:58.431 --> 14:59.632
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.673
- MAYBE HE NEEDS
TO GO OUT.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.544
- HEY, RAYMOND.
HOW YOU DOING?

15:11.578 --> 15:13.213
- HEY, ROBERT.
HOW ARE YOU?

15:13.246 --> 15:14.414
- GREAT. GREAT.

15:14.447 --> 15:15.515
WATCH THIS.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.584
OKAY, SPREAD 'EM.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.023
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.624
[jabbering]

15:24.657 --> 15:28.028
[chuckles]

15:28.061 --> 15:29.229
GOOD BOY.
GOOD BOY.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.297
ISN'T HE GREAT, HUH?

15:30.330 --> 15:32.132
- YEAH, YEAH.
YEAH, HE'S GREAT.

15:32.165 --> 15:34.301
- AND HE AIN'T
THE ONLY ONE.

15:34.334 --> 15:36.103
MY BROTHER.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.604
MIO FRATELLO.

15:39.672 --> 15:42.742
- OHH, LOOK AT THEM,
FRANK.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.411
IT'S SO SWEET

15:44.444 --> 15:47.180
TO SEE YOU TWO
GETTING ALONG LATELY.

15:47.214 --> 15:50.017
IT'S LIKE OLD TIMES.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.285
OH, FRANK, GO GET
THE MOVING PICTURE CAMERA.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.021
I MEAN,
THE WHOLE FAMILY'S HERE.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.356
- AH, THOSE LIGHTS
ARE SO DAMN HEAVY.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.725
- NO, NO, COME ON,
IT'S A SPECIAL OCCASION.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.093
I KNOW WHERE IT IS.
COME ON, COME ON.

16:00.127 --> 16:00.927
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.562
THERE MIGHT STILL BE
SOME FILM LEFT

16:02.595 --> 16:05.532
FROM WHEN WE BROUGHT RAY HOME
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

16:08.135 --> 16:09.669
- THAT'S A GOOD BOY,
SHAMSKY.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.604
THAT'S A GOOD BOY.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.073
- NAMED HIM SHAMSKY, HUH?

16:13.106 --> 16:17.110
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
SHAMSKY ROMAN NUMERAL II.

16:17.144 --> 16:19.479
YEAH.

16:19.512 --> 16:22.149
- ROBERT, THE OWNER
CAME BY TODAY.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.055
- W-WHAT?

16:29.789 --> 16:32.159
- LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY; I--

16:36.696 --> 16:37.764
- THE OWNER.

16:43.270 --> 16:44.371
- LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST FORGET ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT?

16:44.404 --> 16:46.306
I'M GOING TO TELL HER
THAT HE RAN AWAY OR SOMETHING.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.141
THAT'S ALL.
- NO, NO.

16:51.211 --> 16:51.744
GIVE HIM TO HER.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.284
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO LOSE A DOG.

16:57.317 --> 16:58.551
GO AHEAD.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.757
- I'M SORRY.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.294
COME ON, BUDDY.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.165
- OKAY, EVERYBODY SMILE.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.500
COME ON.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.173
- WHERE'S THE DOG?

17:21.441 --> 17:23.443
WHERE'S RAY?

17:23.476 --> 17:24.444
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

17:24.477 --> 17:25.445
WE'RE WASTING FILM!

17:25.478 --> 17:27.480
- CUT, DAD. CUT.

17:28.848 --> 17:32.319
SHAMSKY'S OWNER
SHOWED UP TODAY.

17:32.352 --> 17:33.286
I HAD TO GIVE HIM BACK.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.588
- OH, NO.

17:35.622 --> 17:38.425
OHH, HE WAS
SUCH A SWEET DOG.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.427
- YOU GAVE HIM BACK?

17:40.460 --> 17:42.262
WHAT ABOUT
THE 200 BUCKS WE JUST SPENT

17:42.295 --> 17:43.796
TO HAVE HIM FIXED?

17:50.903 --> 17:51.871
- HI.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.340
ALL RIGHT.
HERE HE IS.

17:53.373 --> 17:54.341
- GREAT.

17:54.374 --> 17:55.708
- WHERE'S THE LADY?

17:55.742 --> 17:57.310
- SHE'S PUTTING
ON SOME MAKEUP.

17:57.344 --> 18:00.680
SHE WANTS TO
LOOK NICE FOR BARON.

18:00.713 --> 18:02.449
HOW'D IT GO OVER THERE?

18:02.482 --> 18:04.184
- IT WAS GREAT.
I WENT OVER THERE.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.285
HE WAS PLAYING
WITH THE DOG.

18:05.318 --> 18:06.686
I SAID, "HEY, ROBERT,"

18:06.719 --> 18:07.687
AND THEN I REACHED
IN HIS CHEST

18:07.720 --> 18:10.757
AND PULLED HIS HEART OUT.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.859
- RAY--

18:12.892 --> 18:14.694
WHAT HAPPENED
OVER THERE?

18:16.329 --> 18:19.266
- WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I TOLD YOU.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.534
- THIS IS NOT
THE SAME DOG--

18:21.568 --> 18:24.437
ANYMORE.

18:24.471 --> 18:25.538
- WHAT ARE YOU--

18:25.572 --> 18:26.773
TALKING ABOUT?

18:26.806 --> 18:27.607
OF COURSE
IT'S THE SAME DOG.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.177
- NO, LOOK CLOSELY, RAY.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.178
- YEAH, YEAH.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.145
- O-OTHER END.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.316
DOESN'T HE LOOK
A LITTLE--

18:36.349 --> 18:38.285
LIGHTER TO YOU?

18:42.955 --> 18:44.524
RAY, HE'S BEEN FIXED.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.893
- GET OUT OF HERE!
COME ON! ARE YOU SURE?

18:46.926 --> 18:48.228
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.330
- MAYBE HE'S JUST
A LITTLE CHILLY.

18:50.363 --> 18:51.598
- NO.

18:53.266 --> 18:55.535
- SHY?
- NO.

18:55.568 --> 18:56.569
- HE WASN'T ALWAYS
LIKE THAT?

18:56.603 --> 18:57.670
- TRUST ME. HE WASN'T.

18:57.704 --> 18:58.871
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

18:58.905 --> 19:00.173
- BECAUSE I NOTICED.

19:00.207 --> 19:01.040
- YOU NOTICED?

19:01.073 --> 19:02.275
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
NOTICING THAT FOR?

19:02.309 --> 19:03.810
I DIDN'T NOTICE!

19:03.843 --> 19:07.180
- RAY, YOU DON'T NOTICE WHEN
I GET A NEW PAIR OF EARRINGS,

19:07.214 --> 19:09.916
AND THOSE ARE
HANGING OFF MY FACE.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.419
- I WOULD NOTICE
IF YOUR EARS WERE MISSING.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.821
- GOD!

19:14.854 --> 19:15.955
THOSE MANIACS.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.857
RAY, WHAT ARE THEY DOING
OVER THERE?

19:17.890 --> 19:21.194
- OH, MY GOD, IT WAS PROBABLY
MY MOTHER'S IDEA.

19:21.228 --> 19:24.163
THIS IS SORT OF
A HOBBY OF HERS.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.268
- BARON!
LET ME LOOK AT YOU!

19:28.301 --> 19:31.404
- HO, HO, HO, HO, HO!

19:31.438 --> 19:32.672
HEY!

19:32.705 --> 19:34.574
WE'RE SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.743
WE ARE HAPPY.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.345
YAY.

19:38.378 --> 19:39.646
- THANK YOU.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.681
WELL, I--

19:41.714 --> 19:45.252
I WON'T TAKE UP
ANY MORE OF YOUR TIME.

19:45.285 --> 19:49.522
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.958
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO BE SEPARATED

19:51.991 --> 19:55.562
FROM SOMETHING
YOU TREASURE SO MUCH.

19:57.497 --> 20:00.199
- I'M SURE BARON
FEELS THE SAME WAY.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.606
- HEY.

20:06.639 --> 20:09.809
I JUST THOUGHT
I'D BRING HIS TOYS BY.

20:09.842 --> 20:13.646
- OH--ISN'T THAT SWEET?

20:13.680 --> 20:16.516
SAY THANK YOU, BARON.

20:16.549 --> 20:17.950
- BARON?

20:19.486 --> 20:22.689
- WELL, GOOD-BYE NOW
AND THANKS AGAIN.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.457
- ALL RIGHT.

20:24.491 --> 20:28.027
- [sighs]
OHH--

20:28.060 --> 20:32.031
WELL--
MAYBE SHE WON'T NOTICE.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.401
- DEBRA, THE WOMAN
BREEDS DOGS, ALL RIGHT.

20:34.434 --> 20:37.637
THE SUBJECT'S GOING TO
COME UP SOONER OR LATER.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.372
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK!

20:39.406 --> 20:40.440
I DON'T KNOW WHO DID IT,

20:40.473 --> 20:41.741
AND I DON'T CARE
WHO DID IT!

20:41.774 --> 20:44.043
ALL I KNOW
IS MY DOG IS RUINED

20:44.076 --> 20:45.678
AND SOMEONE'S GOT TO PAY.

20:45.712 --> 20:46.946
- PHYLLIS, WE TRIED
TO EXPLAIN--

20:46.979 --> 20:49.882
- I DON'T WANT EXPLANATIONS.
I WANT CASH.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.984
THIS DOG IS WORTHLESS NOW.

20:52.018 --> 20:53.286
- WORTHLESS?

20:53.320 --> 20:55.922
- HE'S STILL
A DELIGHTFUL COMPANION.

20:55.955 --> 20:59.292
- COMPANION?
MY ASS!

21:01.361 --> 21:03.730
HE WAS GOOD FOR ONE THING,
AND NOW HE'S BROKEN.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.498
- DON'T TALK ABOUT HIM
LIKE THAT.

21:05.532 --> 21:07.367
- HEY, HEY--

21:07.400 --> 21:09.736
LOOK, I'D LIKE TO BUY
THE DOG FROM YOU.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.438
OKAY, FOR MY BROTHER--

21:11.471 --> 21:12.605
- NO, NO, RAYMOND,
LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO--

21:12.639 --> 21:14.374
- NO, I WANT TO DO THIS,
ROBERT, OKAY?

21:14.407 --> 21:17.310
THIS IS FOR BOTH SHAMSKY'S.

21:17.344 --> 21:18.511
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.

21:18.545 --> 21:20.447
HOW MUCH
WILL YOU TAKE FOR HIM?

21:20.480 --> 21:22.014
- $2,000.

21:22.048 --> 21:23.650
- $2,000?

21:23.683 --> 21:25.918
- MIO FRATELLO.

21:29.088 --> 21:31.057
I LOVE YOU--

21:31.090 --> 21:32.892
- $2,000.

21:32.925 --> 21:35.462
- HE'S A PRIZE-WINNING STUD.

21:35.495 --> 21:37.464
- NOT ANYMORE.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.499
- THANK YOU.

21:39.532 --> 21:41.701
- YEAH.

21:41.734 --> 21:43.703
HEY, HEY, HEY,
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.304
GIVE ME THOSE.

21:48.541 --> 21:50.076
HUH? YEAH.

21:53.413 --> 21:55.047
$2,000--

21:55.081 --> 21:57.484
I COULD HAVE GOT
4,000 HAMSTERS.

22:07.527 --> 22:08.595
- HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT GRIP?

22:08.628 --> 22:09.796
YEAH, THE GRIP'S GOOD.
I LIKE IT.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.431
IT'S BOTTOM HEAVY,
THE CLUB, YOU KNOW?

22:11.464 --> 22:12.499
I LIKE THAT.

22:15.935 --> 22:16.903
- THAT'S A GOOD PUTT.

22:16.936 --> 22:17.837
- YEAH.

22:23.643 --> 22:26.012
YOU KNOW, THIS WAS
A MUCH HARDER SHOT BEFORE--

22:26.045 --> 22:27.647
YEAH.
