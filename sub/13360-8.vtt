35:50.293 --> 35:51.859
You know your brother.

35:52.526 --> 35:54.493
He's a good man.

35:54.526 --> 35:57.393
People make mistakes and
they should be punished.

35:58.193 --> 36:00.059
They should also be forgiven.

36:02.859 --> 36:05.226
Listen to her, please.

36:09.366 --> 36:10.933
I've made my decision.

36:31.333 --> 36:32.866
(SHRIEKING)

36:39.866 --> 36:41.466
JASON: Are you trying
to get yourself killed?

36:41.499 --> 36:42.966
It's what I deserve.

36:43.766 --> 36:45.266
No, get off me!

36:45.299 --> 36:47.466
If we make it through tonight,
then at least
we have a chance.

36:47.499 --> 36:49.633
Of what?

36:49.666 --> 36:51.966
Making it to the next night,
and the next?

36:52.966 --> 36:55.199
This is it,
forever till I die.

36:58.233 --> 36:59.966
(SHRIEKING)

37:01.433 --> 37:02.833
Get back!

37:06.633 --> 37:07.906
Come on.

37:18.072 --> 37:21.406
I had to find a way to get him
back to the rocks.

37:21.972 --> 37:23.572
(GROANS)

37:23.606 --> 37:25.239
I knew he would
never leave me.

37:31.606 --> 37:34.106
If you give yourself up
to the Furies,

37:34.139 --> 37:36.273
I won't get him back
to Helios alone.

37:39.706 --> 37:41.306
Are you really going
to let him die?

37:48.406 --> 37:49.939
JASON: Pythagoras!

37:57.006 --> 37:58.973
PYTHAGORAS: Jason!
JASON: Take my hand.

38:03.873 --> 38:07.813
ARCAS: I, Arcas,
son of Mnesarchus,

38:07.846 --> 38:10.379
forgive the man
who murdered my father.

38:13.246 --> 38:15.913
I call to you to cease
your vengeance.

38:17.346 --> 38:19.146
(GRUNTING)

38:22.013 --> 38:24.513
It has to come
from your heart.

38:24.546 --> 38:26.146
You have to
forgive him completely.

38:26.179 --> 38:28.346
You have to mean it!

38:28.379 --> 38:29.746
I can't!

38:30.279 --> 38:31.679
Please.

38:33.279 --> 38:35.613
He is the kindest man
I have ever known.

38:36.779 --> 38:38.279
I'm sorry, Arcas.

38:44.779 --> 38:46.879
(GROANING)
Pythagoras!

38:51.346 --> 38:52.846
(PANTING)

39:06.646 --> 39:07.986
You came back?

39:19.986 --> 39:21.553
It was Baucis.

39:22.719 --> 39:24.553
I didn't know
you had it in you.

39:26.486 --> 39:28.253
ARCAS: He's my only brother.

39:28.286 --> 39:29.953
So if you'd had another?

39:31.519 --> 39:33.186
Yeah, it might've been
a bit different.

39:33.219 --> 39:34.619
(CHUCKLES)

39:47.853 --> 39:49.886
(SHEEP BLEAT)
(CHICKENS CLUCK)

39:53.153 --> 39:54.253
PHILEMON: We made it.

39:54.286 --> 39:56.119
(CHUCKLES)
HERCULES: I told you
I'd get you here.

39:56.153 --> 39:58.253
Ah, food! At last!

40:00.153 --> 40:02.086
I'll get you some water.

40:02.119 --> 40:03.553
PHILEMON: Thank you.

40:15.126 --> 40:17.526
I was too quick to judge you.

40:17.559 --> 40:19.059
You have a good heart.

40:19.926 --> 40:21.526
So do you.

40:21.559 --> 40:23.526
I have our father's anger.

40:25.359 --> 40:27.793
I'm not coming back
to Atlantis.

40:28.859 --> 40:31.093
I need to make
a life for myself.

40:31.793 --> 40:33.159
You're always welcome.

40:48.693 --> 40:51.759
So where does your bride live?

40:51.793 --> 40:54.126
I don't know.
I've never met her.

40:54.159 --> 40:55.326
And I don't want to.

40:55.359 --> 40:56.426
Your father chose her.

40:56.459 --> 40:57.626
It's the way of my family.

40:58.926 --> 41:01.693
We're going to
travel on to Cyrene,
take our chances there.

41:01.726 --> 41:03.393
You sure you know
what you're doing?

41:03.426 --> 41:04.626
I think so.

41:12.033 --> 41:15.466
So, do we know where we're
delivering these riches?

41:15.899 --> 41:17.099
Uh... Well...

41:17.133 --> 41:20.833
Ah, you thought I was a fool
for accepting Medios's offer,

41:20.866 --> 41:23.333
but I never doubted
we'd succeed

41:23.366 --> 41:26.866
for we are men of pluck,

41:26.899 --> 41:28.099
of mettle

41:28.133 --> 41:30.366
and unerring courage.

41:30.399 --> 41:33.766
You can put
all that mathematics to
good use by telling us

41:33.799 --> 41:35.833
what we're each
about to get paid.

41:37.699 --> 41:38.899
Nothing.

41:40.399 --> 41:42.066
Philemon isn't
getting married.

41:44.766 --> 41:46.199
We can't deliver
the bride price.

41:46.233 --> 41:47.799
We have to take
it back to Atlantis.

41:49.666 --> 41:51.133
Across the desert?

41:55.233 --> 41:56.433
(SIGHS)

41:58.066 --> 42:00.799
HERCULES: Can't believe
you're making me do this.

42:00.833 --> 42:02.699
Could always leave
the cargo in Helios.

42:02.733 --> 42:05.166
But then we'd
lose our fingers.

42:05.199 --> 42:07.006
Better that than
losing my life!

42:07.039 --> 42:08.506
That's not going to happen.

42:08.539 --> 42:10.473
You said it yourself.

42:10.506 --> 42:12.073
"Because we are
men of pluck...

42:12.106 --> 42:13.206
"...of mettle...

42:13.239 --> 42:14.273
"And unfailing courage."

42:14.306 --> 42:16.273
It was unnerving,
unerring courage.

42:16.306 --> 42:17.839
(GIGGLES)

42:19.106 --> 42:21.139
I hate this desert.

42:35.473 --> 42:38.773
MAN: I wish
for you to retrieve...

42:39.306 --> 42:40.806
...a box.

42:40.839 --> 42:43.806
It is to be found in
Campe's lair in Hades.

42:53.239 --> 42:54.773
Where's Medusa?
