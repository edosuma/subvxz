main reasons

is that Wynonna Judd

this song.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.876
My song is "Karma Police"
by Radiohead.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.086
Cool.

08:23.128 --> 08:25.296
I'm like a dark pop,

* Karma police *

08:31.720 --> 08:34.180

Dark pop is a mix
of pop, alternative,

of electronic sounds.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.313
Most of my original songs
that I write

that she stepped on that stage,

08:54.576 --> 08:56.745
I knew exactly who she was
as an artist.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.747
She had one of the most
unique voices.

I'm driven by some
of that darkness myself.

09:20.352 --> 09:22.228
I see myself in you.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.230
I want to understand
the words a little bit better.

09:24.272 --> 09:25.899
That was gonna be
one of my notes.

bit more enunciation.

Okay.
You were floating over
some of the lyrics.

Yeah.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.072
And a song like this
especially,

09:32.113 --> 09:33.907
where they lyrics and the words
and the story are so important.

09:33.948 --> 09:36.242
I feel like we have three
very different singers

09:36.284 --> 09:38.536

19:52.525 --> 19:54.235
Olivia, it's been amazing

19:54.277 --> 19:56.780
to see the way you've, like,
grown through this,

massive chorus

19:58.615 --> 20:00.116
and the notes
you were able to hit.

20:00.158 --> 20:02.327
It was crazy,
and it was pitch perfect.
Thank you.

has come.

Who is the winner
of this knockout?

Why does this not
get any easier?

20:07.332 --> 20:08.583
I wish I could help you.
I actually --

20:08.625 --> 20:10.210
I just --
The next time,

20:10.251 --> 20:13.296

seven really bad singers...

the competition.

Carson, I think I'll just have
to go with what my gut says.

20:31.022 --> 20:33.066
I think...

20:33.108 --> 20:35.026
the winner...

20:35.068 --> 20:36.653
of this knockout is Nini.

Daly: Nini, congratulations!

20:39.989 --> 20:41.908
That means you're moving on
to the playoffs!

20:41.950 --> 20:43.618
Niall: I chose Nini
as the winner of the knockout

20:43.660 --> 20:45.870
because she's supernatural.

Hey! [ Chuckles ]

The things that she can do
with her voice,

20:49.874 --> 20:51.376
no one in this competition
can do.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.670
I actually think that Nini
could win this whole thing.

20:53.712 --> 20:56.172
Azán, you're a hell
of an artist,

20:56.214 --> 20:59.009
and, like, I'm already excited
to see what you do after this.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.552
It's so hard.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.430
Like, how do you send these
super uber talented people home?

21:03.471 --> 21:04.889
I'm so sorry.

Wynonna: I'm so grateful
that I'm just a mentor.

21:29.330 --> 21:30.582
I've always adored you.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.084

"Who is this woman?"

have his hands full.

She's just
a fascinating human

to the team.

of understated stage presence,

21:56.941 --> 21:58.526

freak out

in here right now.
Aww.

that your best is good enough.

Are you guys gonna
sing for us now?

I can't wait for her
to hear you sing.

22:32.811 --> 22:34.020
I really want
to make you proud

22:34.062 --> 22:36.147
because I appreciate you
for stealing.

22:36.189 --> 22:39.192
I am really happy that Gwen
gave me a second chance.

22:39.234 --> 22:40.610
Yes!

to be on her team.

22:44.239 --> 22:46.074
* Help me *

22:46.116 --> 22:48.576
"In My Blood" is a really
important song to me.

22:48.618 --> 22:49.994
I connect with the lyrics

22:50.036 --> 22:52.497
"I need somebody now,
somebody to help me out."

22:52.539 --> 22:56.501
It's just like a scream begging
for somebody to notice you.

22:56.543 --> 22:58.003
* It isn't in my blood *

22:58.044 --> 23:00.547
When I was younger,
I was traveling to Los Angeles

23:00.588 --> 23:04.175
'cause I had a bunch of acting
things that I was trying to do.

23:04.217 --> 23:08.179
It really left me no room
for normal school in Oklahoma.

23:08.221 --> 23:10.181
I had to switch
to an online school,

23:10.223 --> 23:11.474
and that was really tough

23:11.516 --> 23:13.935
because I never really got
to make any friends.

23:13.977 --> 23:16.896
The best part of this entire
experience has really just been

23:16.938 --> 23:18.815
all the connections
I've been able to make,

23:18.857 --> 23:21.443
all the friends that
I wish I had my entire life.

23:21.484 --> 23:23.862
It's more than I could have
ever asked for growing up.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.156
* It isn't in my blood *

23:26.197 --> 23:28.825
Gwen: Tanner -- he has such
a special, unique voice,

23:28.867 --> 23:30.660
and he's only 19 years old.

23:30.702 --> 23:33.580
* It isn't in my blood *

23:33.621 --> 23:35.248
And I wasn't expecting him

23:35.290 --> 23:38.335
to be able to channel
such emotion.

23:38.376 --> 23:41.046
Wynonna: Dang.
Wow, that was
a good performance.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.340
Good lord.
That made me cry.

23:43.381 --> 23:44.466
That was amazing.

23:44.507 --> 23:45.800
Thank you.

23:45.842 --> 23:48.636
I felt that way a year ago
when my mom died.

23:48.678 --> 23:51.181
And I remember getting
the phone call

23:51.222 --> 23:53.767
and I literally said,
"Somebody help me."

23:53.808 --> 23:55.977
Right about here,
I felt it well up,

23:56.019 --> 23:58.897
and that's what songs
are supposed to do,

23:58.938 --> 24:00.231
as painful as they are.

24:00.273 --> 24:03.318
And whatever you went through
to get there,

24:03.360 --> 24:04.736
I'm sorry, too.

24:04.778 --> 24:06.237
That takes a lot of talent,
you know,

24:06.279 --> 24:08.448
to be able to hop
into somebody else's song

24:08.490 --> 24:10.700
and, like,
make it believable.

24:10.742 --> 24:13.453
You're saying
what we're feeling, so amen.

that Wynonna Judd...
Yeah, seriously.

right now?

by the way.

"My mom loves you."

It's okay.

To win this knockout,

24:31.137 --> 24:33.264
I have to really give it
my all emotionally

I'm up against, they are strong.

"Never Can Say Goodbye."

of beautiful things

24:49.072 --> 24:50.782
that she can do
with her voice.

24:50.824 --> 24:53.535
She's bringing
her whistle tone,

24:53.576 --> 24:55.453
and I think
she's really gifted.

24:55.495 --> 24:56.955
I think she could be a star.

24:57.706 --> 24:59.332
Whoo!
Whoo-whoo!

24:59.374 --> 25:00.667

I don't know how you do that
with your voice.

You have this
vintage thing to you.

of the past

in the present.

25:08.049 --> 25:09.676
Yeah.
And that's
a cool thing.

25:09.718 --> 25:14.222
I've been told I have a very
nostalgic and modern vibe.

25:14.264 --> 25:17.308
It's the influences that
I've had throughout my life.

25:17.350 --> 25:20.478
I listened to Nigerian music
the most growing up,

25:20.520 --> 25:23.148
but my journey started
on the Detroit scene,

25:23.189 --> 25:26.735
so I have R&B influence,
pop influence,

25:26.776 --> 25:30.071
so this song is just
right up my alley.

25:30.113 --> 25:32.991
It's like we're in
Chechi's world 1,000%.

25:33.033 --> 25:36.119
It just ignites a certain thing
inside of me

25:36.161 --> 25:38.413
that I think could
really help people

25:38.455 --> 25:41.458
to just understand Chechi.

25:41.499 --> 25:45.003
I feel you so deeply
because the insecurity part

25:45.045 --> 25:47.505
I've wrestled with
my entire life,

25:47.547 --> 25:49.007

I just feel like
you're trying so dang hard.

25:51.885 --> 25:55.430
I want to hear you
try it a little less.

25:55.472 --> 25:58.725
Okay.
There's a fine line
between performing a song

25:58.767 --> 26:00.560
and being a vessel,

26:00.602 --> 26:02.395
being a vessel for the lyric.

Coaches, let me remind you
that Rudi's available

38:52.540 --> 38:53.833
to steal or save.

Rudi, anything you want
to say to Gwen?

38:55.794 --> 38:57.170
Thank you so much, Gwen.

38:57.212 --> 38:58.338
This has been an honor

38:58.380 --> 39:00.882
and the best time
of my whole entire life.

39:20.568 --> 39:22.028
Well, let's start
with you, Coach.

Okay, 'cause I'm standing
and I'm shaking, and --

39:24.614 --> 39:25.782
I'm about to pass out.

for a second, Rudi.

but straight towards your coach.

to steal Rudi?

39:55.854 --> 39:58.273
Well, Rudi, I turned for you
during the blind auditions.

39:58.314 --> 40:01.109
I loved your voice.
I loved everything about you.

40:01.151 --> 40:04.195
I get why you do
different songs.

40:04.237 --> 40:07.991
You're either looking for
yourself to see who you are,

40:08.033 --> 40:10.285
or maybe get a little help
from coaches

40:10.326 --> 40:12.912
and say you fit better
in this category.

40:12.954 --> 40:14.247
I can relate to that.

40:14.289 --> 40:16.541
I've kind of gotten
to sing lots of types

40:16.583 --> 40:17.959
of different genres
of songs.

40:18.001 --> 40:19.169
I do love your vocal,

40:19.210 --> 40:20.920
and I'd love to have you
on my team.

40:20.962 --> 40:22.464
Thank you, Reba.
Thank you.

40:22.505 --> 40:24.090
That's amazing.

John Legend, why do you want
to use your one and only steal

40:25.633 --> 40:26.760
on Rudi?

Hi, Rudi.
Boo!

to coach you.

40:35.977 --> 40:38.229
All we do together

40:38.271 --> 40:41.775
how to put you
in the best position to win,

40:41.816 --> 40:44.069
but also the best position
to show who you are,

40:44.110 --> 40:46.363
and I would love for you
to do it on Team Legend.

40:46.404 --> 40:48.531

Well, well, well.
All right.

gonna be?

Rudi's been so good
throughout the competition,
