[baby crying]

00:03.204 --> 00:05.237
Aw! Shh.

00:05.239 --> 00:08.173
Eric, don't. Don't.

00:08.175 --> 00:10.943
Don't cry. Daddy's here.

00:10.945 --> 00:12.478
Look at this face.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.613
Look at this funny face.

00:22.056 --> 00:25.924
A Roseanne Barr impression's
only gonna anger him more.

00:27.361 --> 00:30.963
I'm not impersonating
Roseanne Barr.

00:30.965 --> 00:32.631
Dom DeLuise.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.401
I'm not impersonating anyone.

00:35.403 --> 00:38.404
I'm trying to get
Eric to stop crying.

00:38.406 --> 00:41.073
Have you tried leaving the room?

00:41.075 --> 00:43.242
Ha! Lighten up, Willie, huh?

00:43.244 --> 00:45.611
Borrow a sense of humor, man.

00:45.613 --> 00:48.914
I'm not in the mood
right now, okay?

00:48.916 --> 00:50.249
You want me to get him to stop?

00:50.251 --> 00:53.619
No, no. Sometimes
babies need to cry.

00:53.621 --> 00:57.656
They just need to
exercise their lungs.

00:57.658 --> 01:01.226
Oh, why, that's fascinating.

01:01.962 --> 01:03.228
[baby cries loudly]

01:03.230 --> 01:04.997
Quiet!

01:04.999 --> 01:06.165
[baby laughs]

01:06.167 --> 01:07.699
It's all in the delivery.

01:07.701 --> 01:10.002
If you need me,
I'll be in the fridge.

01:11.272 --> 01:13.672
[theme music]

02:16.604 --> 02:20.806
So you played Tevye's wife
in "Fiddler On The Roof."

02:20.808 --> 02:23.142
Well, if those aren't
babysitting credentials

02:23.144 --> 02:25.177
I don't know what are.

02:25.179 --> 02:27.913
Thank you.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.314
[sighs]

02:29.316 --> 02:31.550
I can't stand it when they cry.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.352
Could you make it stop?

02:35.022 --> 02:36.255
[chuckles]

02:36.257 --> 02:38.423
- My husband's with him.
- Okay.

02:38.425 --> 02:40.159
Well, I think I know
everything I need to know.

02:40.161 --> 02:42.294
Thank you so much for coming by.

02:42.296 --> 02:46.331
Oh, if it's the crying thing,
I can wear my Walkman.

02:48.102 --> 02:49.568
Goodbye.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.404
And hope you get that part on
"Munsters" today.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.177
[sighs]

02:58.179 --> 02:59.378
[baby crying]

02:59.380 --> 03:00.646
What's for dinner?

03:00.648 --> 03:03.715
Oh, ALF, you just had lunch.

03:03.717 --> 03:06.285
Your dinners
highlight my day, Kate.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.954
But then again, I have no life.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.193
- Any luck?
- No.

03:14.195 --> 03:16.662
You know what I'd love
to have for dinner tonight?

03:16.664 --> 03:17.963
I guess I'm just gonna
have to tell my boss

03:17.965 --> 03:19.565
that I can't show
any more houses

03:19.567 --> 03:21.934
until we get a babysitter.

03:21.936 --> 03:23.869
Pork chops.

03:23.871 --> 03:27.639
Don't worry,
we'll find somebody.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.508
Maybe a nice ham.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.277
You think we're
offering too little?

03:32.279 --> 03:36.148
Maybe we should be paying
more than $6.00 an hour.

03:36.150 --> 03:38.383
Hey, hold it! Flag on the play.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.419
You're paying these people?

03:40.421 --> 03:41.954
I'll do it.

03:43.924 --> 03:46.425
Did you call all
the college papers..

03:46.427 --> 03:48.060
- Of course.
- And every college--

03:48.062 --> 03:49.928
Perhaps you didn't hear me.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.264
Thus, I'll say it again.

03:52.266 --> 03:54.600
I'll baby-sit.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.301
Uh.. No, I don't think so, ALF.

03:56.303 --> 03:59.438
It's nothing
personal, it's just..

03:59.440 --> 04:01.840
Well, I guess it is personal.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.376
Call us crazy, ALF.

04:04.378 --> 04:05.777
Uh, we just feel that

04:05.779 --> 04:07.512
we should have a
human babysitter

04:07.514 --> 04:11.250
what with Eric
being human and all.

04:11.252 --> 04:12.618
Oh, I see.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.653
And have you thought
about what happens to me

04:14.655 --> 04:16.822
while that human babysitter

04:16.824 --> 04:19.124
rummages through my fridge?

04:19.126 --> 04:21.159
What do you mean, "your fridge?"

04:21.161 --> 04:23.028
Okay, it's your fridge.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.864
But the fuzz in the
meat drawer is mine.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.601
When the babysitter's here

04:29.603 --> 04:31.370
you're gonna have
to be in the attic.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.971
Oh, great, prison.

04:32.973 --> 04:36.475
Why don't you just
stick me in a sweatbox?

04:36.477 --> 04:38.043
We're all making
adjustments, ALF.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.646
You're not gonna be
up there all that much.

04:40.648 --> 04:43.515
Attica! Attica! Attica!

04:43.517 --> 04:45.017
ALF, cut the dramatics.

04:45.019 --> 04:47.653
I'm just gonna be
working part-time.

04:47.655 --> 04:50.689
But I've got an instinctive
rapport with kids.

04:50.691 --> 04:53.792
It's a gift that all
Melmacians share.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.527
That and the
ability to suck milk

04:55.529 --> 04:58.096
through our noses.

04:58.098 --> 05:02.200
My...you are blessed,
aren't you?

05:02.202 --> 05:04.236
As passionate as your
argument sounds, ALF

05:04.238 --> 05:06.605
the answer's still no.

05:06.607 --> 05:09.007
But why? Why?

05:09.009 --> 05:10.375
Why?

05:10.377 --> 05:13.312
Because you're irresponsible.

05:13.314 --> 05:14.579
You trash the house.

05:14.581 --> 05:15.714
You flooded the living room.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.449
You wallpapered the shower.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.985
It was a rhetorical question.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.621
[instrumental music]

05:24.892 --> 05:26.224
Okay.

05:26.226 --> 05:29.127
Aw, there you go.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.396
There you go.

05:31.398 --> 05:33.298
There you go.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.701
Aw, there's nothing
more beautiful

05:35.703 --> 05:37.035
than the sight of a mother

05:37.037 --> 05:39.638
holding her
freshly-swaddled babe

05:39.640 --> 05:40.872
to her bosom.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.375
Leave my bosom out of this, ALF.

05:43.377 --> 05:44.910
You're not babysitting Eric.

05:44.912 --> 05:47.179
- Any luck?
- No.

05:47.181 --> 05:49.748
No, I've, I've draped him
over my shoulder

05:49.750 --> 05:51.383
I've laid him across my lap

05:51.385 --> 05:52.551
I've bounced him.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.920
Eric just doesn't want to burp.

05:54.922 --> 05:57.723
Hey, mind if I show you a trick?

05:57.725 --> 05:59.591
The last time you
showed me a trick

05:59.593 --> 06:01.126
it took three weeks
for my eyebrows

06:01.128 --> 06:03.295
to grow back.

06:03.297 --> 06:06.264
I told you not to lean in.

06:06.266 --> 06:09.935
Come on, now. At no time will
the baby leave my hands.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.937
Spot him, Lynn.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.640
Hey, Eric, how you doing?

06:15.642 --> 06:18.677
Having a little
gassy backup today?

06:18.679 --> 06:20.011
[baby burps]

06:20.013 --> 06:21.346
Huzza, huzza.

06:21.348 --> 06:24.416
Who was that masked man?

06:24.418 --> 06:25.550
Next case.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.819
Whoo-hoo! Broccoli.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.488
So, did I prove my point?

06:29.490 --> 06:32.124
That could have been
a coincidence.

06:32.126 --> 06:33.225
So when do I start?

06:33.227 --> 06:35.460
By the way,
Thursdays are bad for me.

06:35.462 --> 06:37.562
I do tai chi.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.431
Granted, ALF,
you give good burp

06:39.433 --> 06:40.665
but that doesn't qualify you

06:40.667 --> 06:42.634
to take care of an infant.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.102
Kate, it can't be any different

06:44.104 --> 06:46.772
than taking care of my
younger brother and sister.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.608
And they had 16
stomachs between them

06:49.610 --> 06:51.243
and one bathroom.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.211
Think about it.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.848
[instrumental music]

07:00.187 --> 07:03.188
Oh, ALF would you heat
the baby's formula for me?

07:03.190 --> 07:05.457
What do you need
formula for, Kate?

07:05.459 --> 07:06.925
Tapped out?

07:08.162 --> 07:09.394
Never mind, I'll do it.

07:09.396 --> 07:11.430
And thanks for not
being petty about this, ALF.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.365
Oh, now I'm being petty.

07:13.367 --> 07:16.134
I'm petty and irresponsible.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.737
You know, in time,
this could become annoying.

07:18.739 --> 07:22.340
Now I'm petty,
irresponsible, and annoying.

07:22.342 --> 07:25.377
The mud is being slung today.

07:25.379 --> 07:27.279
[telephone rings]

07:30.517 --> 07:33.752
Hello.
Oh, hello, Mr. Donovan.

07:33.754 --> 07:36.822
Oh, the property on
Waverly place right now?

07:36.824 --> 07:38.256
Oh, uh, well, gee.

07:38.258 --> 07:41.560
This is not really a
convenient time for..

07:41.562 --> 07:43.895
Oh, that's pretty heavy
wording there, sir.

07:43.897 --> 07:47.265
But I-I don't see
how I could possibly..

07:47.267 --> 07:49.067
Oh, there you go again.

07:50.404 --> 07:51.937
Well, no, no. Of course
I don't want to lose a sale

07:51.939 --> 07:54.306
when it's this close,
it's just that..

07:55.876 --> 07:58.710
Tell him I'll be
there in 15 minutes.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.245
I'd ask you
what you're gonna do

08:00.247 --> 08:02.914
but that would be petty,
annoying, and irresponsible.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.617
Not to mention nosy.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.986
Don't be smug.
I'll call Mrs. Ochmonek.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.055
[imitates buzzer]
Wrong answer.

08:10.057 --> 08:13.358
Oh, I'm sorry.
That was annoying, wasn't it?

08:13.360 --> 08:15.160
They're on vacation.

08:15.162 --> 08:18.964
Um.. Alright,
I'll call Mrs. Carlson.

08:18.966 --> 08:22.601
The woman who stands on corners
and yells at buses?

08:22.603 --> 08:24.669
A wise choice.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.973
Right, right.

08:27.975 --> 08:31.443
Uh, there's Mrs. Applebaum.

08:31.445 --> 08:32.811
Don't you remember?

08:32.813 --> 08:37.449
She's out becoming
Mr. Applebaum.

08:37.451 --> 08:40.051
Oh, that's right.
I forgot to send flowers.

08:40.053 --> 08:43.021
Too late for that.
Send her some aftershave.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.557
Oh, I can't get
a hold of Lynnie.

08:45.559 --> 08:47.459
She's still in school.
Um..

08:47.461 --> 08:48.927
I'm here.

08:48.929 --> 08:52.264
Oh, alright, ALF. Will..

08:52.266 --> 08:53.665
Will you baby-sit Eric?

08:53.667 --> 08:55.267
No, I'm busy.

08:55.269 --> 08:58.069
Of course I will,
you silly ninny.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.471
Ha ha!

08:59.473 --> 09:00.705
ALF, listen

09:00.707 --> 09:01.773
all the important
telephone numbers

09:01.775 --> 09:03.108
are right there by the phone.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.242
No!

09:04.244 --> 09:08.246
I will be back in 45
minutes, alright?

09:08.248 --> 09:10.248
In 40 minutes.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.384
Give Eric his formula when
it's warm. Can you do that?

09:12.386 --> 09:14.619
Kate, don't worry. Go.

09:14.621 --> 09:15.987
Do the American thing

09:15.989 --> 09:19.257
and put your career
ahead of your family.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.192
Okay, okay,
I'm not a bad mother.

09:21.194 --> 09:22.694
I love my child.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.029
I love my child.

09:24.031 --> 09:27.732
ALF, I will be
back in 25 minutes.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.037
In 20 minutes.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.339
Heh.

09:36.310 --> 09:38.343
(woman on TV)
'Charles, where are you?'

09:38.345 --> 09:40.245
'Can you give me a hand
in the kitchen?'

09:40.247 --> 09:43.315
(Charles)
'In a second. I've got a couple
of girls to look after.'

09:43.317 --> 09:45.917
(woman on TV)
'Don't you mean women, Charles?'

09:45.919 --> 09:49.821
Whoo-ho! Pfft!
You low bro.

[baby crying]

09:52.659 --> 09:54.526
Oh, great timing.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.496
I'm coming. I'm coming.

09:58.498 --> 10:02.200
Lets got bail.
He's the next Tony Denzel.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.638
[crying]

10:06.640 --> 10:08.173
Hey, hey, hey!

10:08.175 --> 10:11.042
What's the matter, little guy?

10:11.044 --> 10:12.143
[sniffs]

10:12.145 --> 10:13.078
Whoa!

10:13.080 --> 10:15.347
Sorry, Los Angeles.

10:15.349 --> 10:17.349
Phew!

10:17.351 --> 10:19.351
Alright, I might
be a little rusty.

10:19.353 --> 10:21.219
First the easy part.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.224
[crying continues]

10:28.395 --> 10:31.463
Whoa!
Number two with a bullet.

10:32.866 --> 10:36.701
Alright, let me just
swab the deck, okay?

10:36.703 --> 10:38.303
The old swabber.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.571
[baby laughs]

10:39.573 --> 10:40.839
There you go.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.240
Yeah, yeah.

10:42.242 --> 10:45.143
Now a, a little powder
under your tush.

10:56.757 --> 10:59.557
A little powder under my tush.

10:59.559 --> 11:01.126
Yeah.

11:02.829 --> 11:06.831
Okay, now, a nice, clean diapie.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.635
[baby coos]

11:10.637 --> 11:13.505
Try to keep it that way.

11:13.507 --> 11:15.640
[baby sneezes]

11:15.642 --> 11:17.108
You know, this isn't so bad.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.977
'I know I feel better.'

11:20.213 --> 11:23.014
Yeah, you're a happy guy,
aren't you?

11:23.016 --> 11:25.817
[baby laughs]
Yes, okay.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.786
You amuse yourself

11:27.788 --> 11:31.022
while I bury this bomb.

11:34.561 --> 11:35.560
Clear the area.

11:35.562 --> 11:38.129
Coming through. Watch your back.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.833
I can't believe you
forgot your mitt.

11:41.835 --> 11:44.569
They never play me anyway.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.337
Here, catch.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.374
Better.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.510
I'm gonna go get Eric.

11:52.512 --> 11:54.012
ALF!

11:57.584 --> 11:59.851
ALF!

11:59.853 --> 12:01.486
Hm! I can't find ALF.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.822
He's probably
somewhere out back.

12:03.824 --> 12:04.923
Hey, sweetie.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.725
Oh! You want out? You want out?

12:06.727 --> 12:09.160
[baby cooing]

12:11.965 --> 12:13.531
Brian, tell ALF that mom called

12:13.533 --> 12:14.899
and asked me to get Eric.

12:14.901 --> 12:18.470
And you might want to take
the price tag off the mitt.

12:18.472 --> 12:19.738
And hurry.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.139
Yes, your heinie.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.341
(Lynn)
'I heard that.'

12:23.343 --> 12:24.909
[car horn honks]

12:24.911 --> 12:26.711
ALF, we took the baby!

12:26.713 --> 12:27.946
[honk]

12:27.948 --> 12:30.148
I'm coming. I'm coming.

12:31.818 --> 12:33.785
[car engine starts]

12:33.787 --> 12:37.689
Well, that should take
care of the pesky gophers.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.759
Eric, I'm back!

12:40.761 --> 12:43.461
Did you have time to reload?

12:43.463 --> 12:45.497
Eric?

12:45.499 --> 12:46.898
Eric!

12:46.900 --> 12:47.899
Eric!

12:47.901 --> 12:49.033
Eric!

12:49.035 --> 12:51.569
Oh, he's gone!

12:51.571 --> 12:52.837
What have I done?

12:52.839 --> 12:54.105
Eric!

12:55.242 --> 12:58.943
Well, so much for
keeping my powder dry.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.546
Eric!

13:05.485 --> 13:08.253
(ALF)
Okay, operator,
then how about this?

13:08.255 --> 13:11.990
The baby got zapped
into a parallel universe!

13:11.992 --> 13:14.225
I've seen it happen.

13:14.227 --> 13:17.629
A crank? Do I sound
like a crank, huh?

13:17.631 --> 13:18.863
[door rattles]

13:18.865 --> 13:19.931
Uh-oh, that must be Willie.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.066
I'll call you right back.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.070
Hi, ALF.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.605
Oh, hi, Willie.

13:27.607 --> 13:30.575
I didn't see you come in.
How was your day?

13:30.577 --> 13:32.610
Mm. Don't ask.

13:32.612 --> 13:35.079
I won't if you won't.

13:35.081 --> 13:37.148
Oh, right. What've you done?

13:37.150 --> 13:40.251
And what's it going to cost me?

13:40.253 --> 13:42.754
Well, you see, Willie,
that's the beauty of it.

13:42.756 --> 13:46.891
In the long-run,
it's gonna save you money.

13:46.893 --> 13:48.726
Oh.

13:48.728 --> 13:51.095
You mean you did do something?

13:51.097 --> 13:54.032
I may have. I don't know.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.467
That's where you come in.

13:56.469 --> 13:59.804
Where's Kate?
I want her to tell me.

13:59.806 --> 14:01.039
She doesn't know yet.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.240
She jumped off the mommy track

14:02.242 --> 14:04.375
and went to show some property.

14:04.377 --> 14:07.011
Well, who did she
leave the baby with?

14:07.013 --> 14:08.379
Me.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.215
Oh..

14:10.217 --> 14:12.650
So, you wanna split a fifth?

14:14.087 --> 14:16.521
What I want is to..

14:16.523 --> 14:17.889
...check on Eric.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.157
Fine. Go ahead.

14:19.159 --> 14:22.293
But whatever you do,
don't go in the kitchen.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.062
[hisses]

14:32.739 --> 14:36.040
Eric! Eric, you get back
in this dimension

14:36.042 --> 14:37.809
right now, buster!

14:37.811 --> 14:40.211
I mean it. Where are you?

14:57.831 --> 15:00.064
This kitchen's fine.

15:01.935 --> 15:03.601
Now I am scared.

15:04.738 --> 15:08.106
(ALF)
Eric! Eric, are you up here?

15:08.108 --> 15:11.209
Eric,
this isn't funny anymore.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.811
Uh..

15:13.813 --> 15:14.979
ALF!

15:14.981 --> 15:17.282
Oh, hi, Willie.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.884
Whatever you do, don't go
to the Chrysler Building

15:19.886 --> 15:22.120
in New York.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.355
What are you
doing in the chimney?

15:24.357 --> 15:26.357
(ALF)
Well, it has nothing
to do with Eric

15:26.359 --> 15:28.226
if that's what
you're getting at.

15:32.699 --> 15:36.200
Willie! Willie!
Can you get me out of here?

15:43.076 --> 15:44.876
(ALF)
'Willie?'

15:44.878 --> 15:46.978
Where is he?

15:46.980 --> 15:48.546
So you don't see him either?

15:48.548 --> 15:52.617
Good. We're finally
getting somewhere.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.018
ALF!

15:54.020 --> 15:55.753
I don't know, Willie!

15:55.755 --> 15:57.689
He disappeared!

15:57.691 --> 16:00.058
Disappeared?
What are you talking about?

16:00.060 --> 16:01.826
I don't know
what I'm talking about!

16:01.828 --> 16:04.295
That's what I'm talking about.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.230
Did you check the house?

16:06.232 --> 16:08.933
Eric!
Eric, it's dad.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.835
I looked everywhere, Willie.

16:10.837 --> 16:12.270
I'm sorry!

16:12.272 --> 16:13.972
I'm sorry!

16:13.974 --> 16:16.174
I just wanted to do good.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.810
I just wanted to make $6.00.

16:20.513 --> 16:24.782
Alright, let's take this
one step at a time.

16:24.784 --> 16:27.485
When was the last
time you saw him?

16:27.487 --> 16:29.287
When I changed his diaper.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.289
I took it outside to bury it.

16:31.291 --> 16:34.525
When I came back, he was gone.

16:34.527 --> 16:38.229
Is it possible you
took him with you?

16:38.231 --> 16:39.931
Well, it was a
pretty heavy diaper.

16:39.933 --> 16:43.201
But...no. Could I?

16:45.271 --> 16:47.238
Oh, Lord.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.675
Eric!

16:50.677 --> 16:52.010
Eric!

16:52.012 --> 16:53.277
Oh, ALF, give up.

16:53.279 --> 16:56.280
He's obviously not out here.

16:56.282 --> 16:58.483
This is not happening to me.

16:58.485 --> 17:02.553
There's got to be some
logical explanation.

17:02.555 --> 17:03.821
Maybe..

17:03.823 --> 17:06.224
...a dingo took your baby.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.626
It happened to Meryl Streep.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.496
Maybe he was crying, right?

17:11.498 --> 17:14.599
And you picked up and walked him
around to settle him

17:14.601 --> 17:18.603
put him down somewhere
and don't remember where.

17:18.605 --> 17:21.339
Willie, you're grasping
at straws.

17:23.076 --> 17:24.842
I'm calling the police.

17:24.844 --> 17:26.244
I'm sorry.

17:26.246 --> 17:29.113
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

17:29.115 --> 17:31.482
Would it help if I apologize?

17:33.119 --> 17:34.786
Eric!

17:36.189 --> 17:39.991
Operator, could
you get me 911 quick?

17:39.993 --> 17:43.361
Oh, of course I realize
I could've dialed that myself.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.864
So you can dial it for me.

17:46.866 --> 17:50.835
Which way do you
think will be faster?

17:50.837 --> 17:53.004
Please take control.

17:53.006 --> 17:55.139
Oh, thank you.

17:55.141 --> 17:57.408
And you.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.143
Did they find him?

17:59.145 --> 18:01.245
Uh, I'm on hold.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.314
Oh, what's gonna happen to me?

18:03.316 --> 18:05.183
I'll probably get the chair.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.051
I don't want to die, Willie.

18:07.053 --> 18:09.287
But mostly, I don't like pain.

18:10.824 --> 18:12.156
Hello, 911

18:12.158 --> 18:14.025
I want to report a missing baby.

18:14.027 --> 18:15.426
You've got to find him, please.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.195
H-he's only six months old.

18:17.197 --> 18:18.463
He's out there. He's all alone.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.765
He's scared. He's vulnera..

18:22.235 --> 18:25.036
Can I call you right back?

18:25.038 --> 18:27.004
Uh-oh.

18:27.006 --> 18:28.906
Stay put.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.541
Hi, honey.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.310
Who was that on the phone?

18:34.581 --> 18:36.981
I have something very serious
to tell you, Kate.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.216
Whatever you do, Kate

18:38.218 --> 18:39.817
don't go to the
Chrysler Building

18:39.819 --> 18:42.720
in New York.

18:42.722 --> 18:45.523
What has he done, and how much
is it going to cost us?

18:50.497 --> 18:52.530
I don't know how to say this.

18:52.532 --> 18:55.933
Willie, what..
Is it my mother?

18:55.935 --> 18:57.902
We should be so lucky.

19:00.173 --> 19:01.772
Sit down.

19:04.043 --> 19:06.711
I can't find Eric. He's missing.
I've looked everywhere.

19:06.713 --> 19:09.747
Oh, honey, Eric is with us.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.349
[door opens]

19:11.351 --> 19:12.617
Hi.

19:12.619 --> 19:13.851
Eric!

19:14.888 --> 19:16.787
Oh!

19:16.789 --> 19:17.955
Eric!

19:17.957 --> 19:20.458
How come you never
greet me like that?

19:20.460 --> 19:22.693
Oh, Lynn.

19:22.695 --> 19:26.597
Lynn, you wouldn't
believe what happened here.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.934
What did ALF do, and how much
is it going to cost us?

19:29.936 --> 19:33.804
We thought he
lost our little Eric.

19:33.806 --> 19:37.742
It would've cost him his life.

19:37.744 --> 19:40.211
Isn't that the silliest thing?

19:40.213 --> 19:42.313
[baby coos]

19:42.315 --> 19:45.216
Look at this. ALF, he's safe.

19:45.218 --> 19:48.819
He's safe, isn't that wonderful?

19:48.821 --> 19:51.856
Hey, Eric, if I wasn't
doing a good job

19:51.858 --> 19:52.957
you should've told me

19:52.959 --> 19:57.228
instead of hopping the
first dingo out of here.

19:57.230 --> 19:58.763
ALF, that isn't what happened.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.398
I got a hold of
Lynn after school

20:00.400 --> 20:01.732
and asked her to
take Eric with her

20:01.734 --> 20:03.868
over to Brian's baseball game.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.771
I told Brian to
tell you. Didn't he?

20:06.773 --> 20:10.908
Oh, yeah. Obviously he did,
and it slipped my mind.

20:10.910 --> 20:14.645
Oh, my gosh. What you guys
must've gone through here.

20:14.647 --> 20:18.683
Oh, well, I'm just
grateful it's over.

20:18.685 --> 20:21.485
Hey, why don't you tell her
how you really feel, Willie?

20:21.487 --> 20:24.589
Go ahead, give it to her good.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.958
That is how I really feel.

20:26.960 --> 20:30.161
Oh, then while
that dust settles

20:30.163 --> 20:33.097
I'd like to say something, Kate.

20:33.099 --> 20:34.432
Okay.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.801
Contrary to what
you people must think

20:36.803 --> 20:38.436
I have feelings.

20:38.438 --> 20:41.472
I cried during terms
of endearment.

20:41.474 --> 20:43.774
Although I thought
it was manipulative

20:43.776 --> 20:46.611
it touched me just the same.

20:46.613 --> 20:49.680
You also cried
during "Caddyshack II."

20:49.682 --> 20:51.849
But for different reasons.

20:51.851 --> 20:54.485
Anyway, while you were
out showing real estate

20:54.487 --> 20:56.621
I dropped half my body fluid

20:56.623 --> 20:59.790
not that it matters to you.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.326
Well, I had no idea, ALF.

21:02.328 --> 21:04.762
I mopped it up.

21:04.764 --> 21:05.863
Thank you.

21:05.865 --> 21:08.399
And here's the
real coupe de ville

21:08.401 --> 21:10.268
you fired me without
even giving me

21:10.270 --> 21:12.737
the chance to prove myself.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.038
And this was one
of the few times

21:14.040 --> 21:17.808
I didn't mess up.
Way to trust.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.910
I've been unfair to you, ALF.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.579
Hey, I was doing
a really good job

21:21.581 --> 21:23.781
before you pulled the rug out.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.750
Will you give us another chance?

21:25.752 --> 21:27.985
Not for six bucks an hour

21:27.987 --> 21:29.387
but we'll talk.

21:29.389 --> 21:31.155
[baby coos]

21:34.127 --> 21:36.560
[instrumental music]

21:37.363 --> 21:39.030
[snoring]

21:39.032 --> 21:40.698
[baby cooing]

21:40.700 --> 21:44.001
- Willie, what time does..
- Shh, Kate.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.670
Look at this.

21:45.672 --> 21:50.608
Oh, it's so cute, honey.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.076
(Willie)
You think the day will ever come

21:52.078 --> 21:55.279
that he'll be able to
walk out of here unafraid?

21:55.281 --> 21:57.848
Won't have to hide anymore?

21:57.850 --> 22:02.353
I hope so.
It's what keeps me going.

22:02.355 --> 22:04.021
Come on, let's get
your jammies on.

22:04.023 --> 22:06.457
Let's get your jammies on.
Daddy's going to come, too.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.726
Yeah. Yeah.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.564
[yawns]

22:13.566 --> 22:15.599
Ah!
Oh, sorry, Eric.

22:15.601 --> 22:18.402
I must've dozed off.

22:18.404 --> 22:20.071
Eric!

22:20.073 --> 22:21.505
Eric!

22:21.507 --> 22:24.275
Oh, no! Not again!

22:24.277 --> 22:26.877
