07:41.128 --> 07:42.896
Each person has his or her own way

07:43.130 --> 07:44.898
of living a life pleasing to God.

07:45.132 --> 07:49.636
Some will serve on the front line in the military.

07:49.870 --> 07:54.308
Some will retreat to a life of monastic study.

07:54.541 --> 07:55.542
In my opinion,

07:55.776 --> 07:58.011
the most important task is teaching

07:58.245 --> 07:59.847
investing in people.

10:21.555 --> 10:24.157
Our friends will migrate

10:24.391 --> 10:27.160
to the four corners of the world.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.630
Because of the principle that

10:29.863 --> 10:31.331
a believer's intention is more benevolent
than his action,

10:31.565 --> 10:33.133
so with the most sincere intentions,

10:33.367 --> 10:38.071
they should scatter around the world.

10:53.754 --> 11:01.028
The city of Sarajevo was under siege.

11:02.729 --> 11:07.000
Entrance to Sarajevo was through a tunnel.

11:07.234 --> 11:08.535
It's dark,

11:08.769 --> 11:10.270
your shoes are soaking wet,

11:10.504 --> 11:11.605
there is no air,

11:11.838 --> 11:14.241
your backpack is heavy on your shoulders.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.543
The physical conditions were intolerable,

11:16.777 --> 11:25.285
but we were happy to reach our goal.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.931
Our esteemed teacher Mr. Gulen

12:11.164 --> 12:16.603
sent us here to help the people.

12:16.837 --> 12:17.838
We weren't concerned with

12:18.071 --> 12:22.743
how we were going to do it,

12:22.976 --> 12:25.011
our goal was to come here.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.814
Bombs were dropping

12:28.048 --> 12:29.983
the war was ongoing.

12:30.217 --> 12:32.219
I said, we may die there,

12:32.452 --> 12:33.987
we might not come back.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.589
If we don't survive,

12:35.822 --> 12:41.795
will you do the final prayer for us?

12:42.028 --> 12:43.630
He got very emotional.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.198
His eyes welled up (with tears).

12:45.432 --> 12:47.200
His face became solemn

12:47.434 --> 12:51.004
He said, "I'm not sending you there to die,

12:51.238 --> 12:55.542
I'm sending you there to serve, to open schools.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.544
May God be with you.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.613
May God show you the way."

13:03.316 --> 13:05.318
We went to the Ministry of Education

13:05.552 --> 13:07.187
- usually it was Ibrahim â€”

13:07.420 --> 13:10.791
every single day.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.059
They would say, "what school?

13:13.293 --> 13:14.528
The government's about to collapse,

13:14.761 --> 13:15.529
people are miserable.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.264
What school?"

13:17.497 --> 13:20.801
But we didn't give up.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.002
We kept knocking on their door

13:22.235 --> 13:23.170
again and again.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.971
One day they called us.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.941
They said, "Okay, we'll give you a building for a school."

13:28.175 --> 13:32.846
They gave us an old Serbian military post.

13:56.203 --> 13:56.937
With this game,

13:57.170 --> 14:00.040
we are trying to use the
universal language of sports.

14:00.273 --> 14:01.942
To convey a message to world media,

14:02.175 --> 14:03.944
and the peoples of the world

14:04.177 --> 14:07.747
But particularly to Muslim nations,

14:07.981 --> 14:14.921
who in silent indignation

14:15.188 --> 14:18.792
have been doing nothing

14:19.025 --> 14:24.030
but watch as spectators
in an arena of fighters.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.143
When I see Mr. Ali,

14:37.377 --> 14:39.145
with his smile,

14:39.379 --> 14:41.147
he is taking your heart.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.985
There is no badness in him.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.720
What do we need in the war?

14:46.953 --> 14:51.124
Food, drinking, just to save our life.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.559
But they come in the war and

14:52.792 --> 14:54.561
And they are going to teach us.

14:54.794 --> 14:58.665
For us it was very unbelievable.

14:58.899 --> 15:02.068
In our school there are Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian,

15:02.302 --> 15:03.737
and they really teach us

15:03.970 --> 15:07.540
you cannot hate me, how much can I love you?

15:07.774 --> 15:09.643
Let's try to love people,

15:09.876 --> 15:11.678
and that teacher comes here and

15:11.912 --> 15:14.881
teaches us something like that.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.216
If they didn't come here,

15:16.449 --> 15:19.119
I would never be thinking like now.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.954
Maybe I will hate those people

15:21.187 --> 15:24.724
from another side.

15:43.510 --> 15:44.244
In Bosnia

15:44.477 --> 15:47.514
we play west instruments

15:47.747 --> 15:52.719
when we must sing east music.

15:52.953 --> 15:55.889
I try adjusting east melody

15:56.122 --> 15:58.625
to European melody.

15:58.858 --> 16:02.595
And now we have one special music.

16:31.791 --> 16:35.929
Everything that God created is beautiful, wonderful.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.931
We must respect everything

16:38.164 --> 16:41.768
and also music, also tones.

16:42.002 --> 16:46.606
For example, natural music.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.309
Birds sing.

16:49.542 --> 16:53.980
Water have sound.

16:54.214 --> 16:58.752
Woods have sound, wind have sound.

16:58.985 --> 17:00.987
All life on the planet,

17:01.221 --> 17:03.323
that music be there.

17:03.556 --> 17:07.193
And that music never be boring people.

17:07.426 --> 17:08.328
Why?

17:08.560 --> 17:10.763
Because it's clean music.

17:10.997 --> 17:13.233
That music God gives.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.633
We live together

18:20.867 --> 18:22.635
and we sing together

18:22.869 --> 18:24.938
Muslims, Catholics, Orthodox.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.744
We must respect each other.

18:31.978 --> 18:34.714
We must respect each other's culture.

18:34.948 --> 18:37.283
We must respect each other's religion.

18:37.517 --> 18:41.221
Because we have only one God

18:41.454 --> 18:45.792
and He created us.

22:25.978 --> 22:28.581
His Excellency and I

22:28.848 --> 22:31.084
we love each other.

22:34.187 --> 22:41.160
And I'm sure no one here in the audience

22:41.494 --> 22:46.232
will be jealous of us.

22:55.041 --> 22:56.809
When we stand side by side

22:57.043 --> 22:59.946
we will truly get to know one another

23:00.179 --> 23:01.948
Maybe we were raised in a culture

23:02.181 --> 23:05.818
where we deemed only our own opinions
to be important.

23:06.085 --> 23:07.820
We ignored the other side

23:08.087 --> 23:14.660
and rejected that which wasn't ours.

23:15.995 --> 23:18.297
Perhaps in those days

23:18.598 --> 23:21.100
when we spoke

23:21.567 --> 23:24.771
our words were careless.

23:25.004 --> 23:30.109
But today when the world is tilting
towards harm

23:30.376 --> 23:35.715
we realize that we should not allow
such things to happen.

39:34.106 --> 39:38.510
When I was 15 yrs old
I decided to be an engineer.

39:38.744 --> 39:43.849
I liked that because I said that for my city an engineer
would be very nice

39:44.082 --> 39:48.320
because there are lots of projects.

39:56.194 --> 40:00.732
The most important project for me
was the water project.

40:00.966 --> 40:05.003
Nearly half of Sulaymaniyah
needed that water project.

40:05.237 --> 40:09.975
Now they get water from that.

40:10.208 --> 40:14.780
We poured concrete from
about 6:00 til 10 at night

40:15.046 --> 40:20.652
we were in here with the men and yeah...

40:23.722 --> 40:27.325
This project cost $30 Million dollar.

40:27.559 --> 40:31.763
You know that here they say that
engineering's not for girls.

40:33.965 --> 40:36.501
My mother, she doesn't agree with me.

40:36.735 --> 40:41.673
But I'm very happy now. I like to do that.

40:41.907 --> 40:44.709
At first the men didn't believe us here

40:44.943 --> 40:49.147
But now when I showed my ability and I worked,
I insisted in that

40:49.414 --> 40:53.652
and said I can do it
and when I showed my ability,

40:53.885 --> 41:00.225
now they can take me to that project
and I now continue on that.

42:51.770 --> 42:55.574
Seeing thousands of babies dying in Somalia
moved me deeply.

42:56.942 --> 43:01.413
That's when I decided I had to go.

43:03.214 --> 43:08.753
I was thinking about my own children,
how healthy they are,

43:08.987 --> 43:13.158
so I went there to give thanks to God Almighty.

43:31.276 --> 43:35.780
There is no water, there is no food,
and there is no medicine.

43:36.014 --> 43:39.084
There is nothing! Nothing.

43:39.317 --> 43:43.254
Only Kimse Yok Mu, in Somalia.

44:03.775 --> 44:08.146
It was raining
when we got to Somalia.

44:09.414 --> 44:12.217
The rain was beautiful,
but a little bit of a bother.

44:12.517 --> 44:20.291
Because we had medicine in 21 boxes,
we were worried that they would get soaked.

44:22.160 --> 44:26.865
I brought a good ultrasound machine,

44:27.232 --> 44:33.171
which helps me in diagnosing
and examining the patients.

45:08.840 --> 45:13.278
We tell people the Somalis live in tents,

45:13.545 --> 45:16.614
but it's not the kind of tent you would think of.

45:16.848 --> 45:22.654
It's a frame made of branches
with a cloth on top.

45:22.887 --> 45:29.094
I can't imagine what people do
with their kids when it rains.

45:30.962 --> 45:33.064
The situation is terrible.

45:35.934 --> 45:38.436
She has malaria and dysentery.

45:39.838 --> 45:42.907
Did she go to the clinic?

45:45.343 --> 45:50.281
Yes, she got a prescription

45:51.216 --> 45:56.421
Tell her to come to the clinic
and we'll give her medicine.

46:11.369 --> 46:19.644
Today I went to the biggest hospital in Mogadishu.
One of the biggest ones.

46:21.179 --> 46:27.552
There is a patient bleeding and
she needs emergency operation.

46:28.019 --> 46:33.057
- "Hold it gently, gently. That's super.

46:33.291 --> 46:37.195
There was a big surprise for me because
there is no instruments.

46:37.428 --> 46:43.535
And there were 3 assistants
who are trained in Turkey just 3 months.

46:43.768 --> 46:49.040
"This is a golden rule...you got it?"

46:49.274 --> 46:54.846
Thanks to Allah, everything was okay and finished.

47:57.308 --> 48:01.613
"Muttalip was going to bring soap,
but he didn't."

48:01.846 --> 48:08.820
"You think the guards would let the prisoners have soap?
They'd keep it for themselves."

48:09.053 --> 48:15.193
"Muttalip, you forgot the soap again."

48:15.426 --> 48:21.866
"You're the medicine, Muttalip."

48:34.312 --> 48:39.317
Until recently they were sleeping on bare floors.
So Kimse Yok Mu brought mattresses.

48:39.550 --> 48:46.624
We provide clothing
and scented cleansing wipes.

48:46.858 --> 48:52.263
Hizmet went to many different countries
with teachers and schools.

48:52.530 --> 48:58.069
In Somalia, doctors with Hizmet
were the first to come help.

48:58.303 --> 49:01.906
I am proud of that.

50:53.918 --> 50:56.988
I'm not returning because
I don't want to be a cause for problems there.

50:57.221 --> 51:02.360
I don't want to be the cause of any discomfort
or loss of the gains that have been made.

51:02.627 --> 51:10.068
Even if the chance of such damage occurring
were only 1 percent,

51:10.301 --> 51:17.008
this concern would be enough
to keep me away.

52:13.097 --> 52:22.974
Living at a time when people are locked to kill,
murder, tyrannize and victimize,

52:23.207 --> 52:31.249
I consider it the top priority for our human community
to prevent this violence and rage as much as we can.

52:31.482 --> 52:34.852
I pray that people live in dignity
as they are meant to

52:35.086 --> 52:36.888
that they rise toward their humanistic peaks,

52:37.121 --> 52:40.224
that they embrace one another,

52:40.491 --> 52:47.665
that the goodness that Rumi
sought come true,

52:47.899 --> 52:53.271
that hostility and hatred are buried deep down
and rocks are placed over them

52:53.504 --> 52:55.806
so that they do not surface again.

52:56.040 --> 52:57.108
This is what I pray for.

52:57.341 --> 52:59.243
You should pray for this too.
