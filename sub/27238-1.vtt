They've broken through
the front lines!

01:04.914 --> 01:06.548
I've lost contact
with the capital!

01:06.550 --> 01:08.084
There's too many of them!

01:10.253 --> 01:11.487
Stand fast!

01:14.590 --> 01:15.689
Finish them!

01:27.136 --> 01:29.004
Where's B-127?

01:42.752 --> 01:44.550
Sorry I'm late.
I hit a little traffic.

01:44.552 --> 01:46.519
Get down!
Incoming!

01:46.521 --> 01:47.522
Uh, Optimus.

01:49.624 --> 01:53.760
Decepticons, attack!

01:53.762 --> 01:58.398
Autobots, fall back!
Get to the tower!

01:58.400 --> 02:02.504
Destroy the launch pad!
Let none escape!

02:08.342 --> 02:12.411
Cybertron has fallen.
Get to the escape pods.

02:12.413 --> 02:15.614
There are other Autobots
scattered across the galaxy.

02:15.616 --> 02:17.948
We must reach them
if we hope to survive.

02:17.950 --> 02:20.487
Optimus, this is our home.
We have to fight for it.

02:26.326 --> 02:30.261
We will fight on. But we
must find refuge first.

02:30.263 --> 02:33.931
I found a planet that's well hidden.
Earth.

02:33.933 --> 02:36.867
You will travel there and
establish a base for us.

02:36.869 --> 02:39.670
Once we've gathered the
others, we'll join you.

02:39.672 --> 02:41.505
You must protect
the planet.

02:41.507 --> 02:46.544
If the Decepticons find it, then
our people are truly finished.

02:46.546 --> 02:47.913
Now go!

03:03.161 --> 03:06.498
Good luck, soldier.
I'll buy you some time.

04:09.793 --> 04:10.858
No!

04:10.860 --> 04:12.292
Ow! Ow! Ow!

04:12.294 --> 04:13.160
Okay, okay!

04:13.162 --> 04:15.164
I'm dead already,
man!

04:16.331 --> 04:18.432
Oh, not just you.

04:18.434 --> 04:19.966
Being the overachiever
that you are,

04:19.968 --> 04:22.235
you managed to get your
whole squad killed, Danny.

04:22.237 --> 04:23.103
Bravo.

04:23.105 --> 04:24.337
Come on, man.
Those things sting.

04:24.339 --> 04:26.306
- What things? These things?
- Ow!

04:26.308 --> 04:28.442
You know, I wouldn't know. I haven't been hit yet.

04:28.444 --> 04:31.010
Ow! Okay, you know what? That's too close, man.

04:31.012 --> 04:32.345
You could've taken out an eye.

04:32.347 --> 04:34.714
I got a date tonight, man.
This ain't sexy!

04:34.716 --> 04:36.982
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- Ow!

04:36.984 --> 04:38.284
That one was on me.

04:38.286 --> 04:40.252
That's a malfunctioning
trigger.

04:40.254 --> 04:43.389
This weapon is just faulty. Someone
is going to get a talking to...

04:43.391 --> 04:44.557
Man, would you stop?

04:44.559 --> 04:46.394
All right, just stop.

04:47.595 --> 04:49.662
I should've
let you die in Grenada.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.430
If you did, we wouldn't be
able to come to the forest,

04:51.432 --> 04:53.466
run around and play
these awesome games.

04:53.468 --> 04:54.667
Exactly.

04:55.937 --> 04:57.470
Oh, I hate you.

04:57.472 --> 05:00.739
Wow, man, that hurts.
'Cause I love you.

05:00.741 --> 05:03.542
But you refuse to let it in
'cause you got intimacy issues.

05:03.544 --> 05:05.411
A therapist will probably tell you
you weren't hugged enough as a kid.

05:05.413 --> 05:08.281
- Look, man.
- Danny, I know I look stupid, but...

05:09.650 --> 05:11.449
Hey, yo, take cover!

05:23.697 --> 05:25.565
Danny.

05:25.966 --> 05:27.632
You okay?

05:27.634 --> 05:29.369
Uh, yeah, man.

05:32.004 --> 05:33.872
This is Agent Jack Burns.

05:33.874 --> 05:35.773
I need medical
up here now.

05:35.775 --> 05:37.040
We have
a projectile strike

05:37.042 --> 05:39.076
in the northwest corner
of the training course.

05:39.078 --> 05:40.945
Multiple injuries.

05:40.947 --> 05:45.816
And would someone please explain to me
why you dropped napalm on your own guys!

05:45.818 --> 05:49.286
<i>Negative. There are no
live fire drills in the northwest sector.</i>

05:49.288 --> 05:51.290
What the hell hit us, then?

06:04.135 --> 06:05.603
Target on your right!

06:20.418 --> 06:24.756
I need all of you to fan out
and track that thing down now!

06:27.892 --> 06:29.092
Drive!

06:35.632 --> 06:36.633
There!

06:40.038 --> 06:41.503
What the hell?

06:41.505 --> 06:42.606
Take it down!

06:46.977 --> 06:49.245
Get down there now
and flush that thing out!

06:50.179 --> 06:51.380
There it is!

07:00.222 --> 07:02.325
<i>Target has been located, sir.</i>

07:03.793 --> 07:04.794
Light it up!

07:15.638 --> 07:16.639
Damn it!

07:27.749 --> 07:29.117
Oh, no.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.564
It's going for the mine!
Cut it off!

07:58.846 --> 08:00.479
Move, move!

08:13.292 --> 08:14.392
Please.

08:14.394 --> 08:16.229
This is a mistake.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.831
Stay cool.
Hold your fire.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.766
I don't want
to hurt anyone.

08:29.308 --> 08:30.643
Who called in the Air Force?

08:34.881 --> 08:36.683
That's not the Air Force.

08:42.121 --> 08:43.321
Run.

09:06.812 --> 09:08.577
Did you think you could hide?

09:18.156 --> 09:20.322
Now you'll die screaming.

09:20.324 --> 09:22.526
Like your friends!

09:57.627 --> 10:00.293
Tell me where
your friends are hiding.

10:00.295 --> 10:02.029
I'll never talk.

10:02.031 --> 10:03.767
Is that right?

10:05.634 --> 10:07.601
Then let's
make it official.

10:36.898 --> 10:39.232
B-127...

10:39.234 --> 10:41.767
As a member
of the Autobot resistance,

10:41.769 --> 10:44.236
you are a traitor
to Cybertron

10:44.238 --> 10:46.739
and are hereby sentenced

10:46.741 --> 10:47.742

Breakfast is conveniently located

- Ah.
- Try to help out...

14:13.506 --> 14:15.139

You know, $500 is really all
I need to finish the Corvette.

14:31.257 --> 14:35.692
I don't have $500. You

14:35.694 --> 14:38.262
"Half as much as doctors
for twice the work," right?

14:38.264 --> 14:39.562

Um, I could if I had a car.

15:05.490 --> 15:09.124
Just let him follow you on your
bike so nobody abducts him.

22:12.734 --> 22:14.200
<i>No dinner
for you tonight.</i>

22:14.202 --> 22:18.537
<i>But I'm starved!
I've been fasting since lunch!</i>

22:19.540 --> 22:22.210
<i>Well,
I did eat that pumpkin.</i>

22:42.530 --> 22:44.130
Happy birthday.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.545
I miss you, Dad.

23:00.012 --> 23:01.880
I think it's too low, honey.

23:01.882 --> 23:02.947
No.

23:02.949 --> 23:05.048
No, I think it goes
to that button.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.116
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:06.118 --> 23:08.887
I don't know about...
Fix it.

23:08.889 --> 23:09.954
Hey.

23:09.956 --> 23:12.556
- Good morning, birthday girl!
- Hi.

23:12.558 --> 23:14.026
You look...

23:15.795 --> 23:16.795
Nice.

23:17.898 --> 23:19.429
Happy birthday, baby.

23:19.431 --> 23:22.468
I love you. Come on, open your present.
I'm gonna be late for work.

23:24.068 --> 23:25.538
Thanks, Mom.

23:29.975 --> 23:31.710
Helmet. With...

23:32.444 --> 23:33.577
Daffodils.

23:33.579 --> 23:35.311
So, I keep hearing

23:35.313 --> 23:39.315
about people on mopeds getting run
over and their brains smashed in.

23:39.317 --> 23:41.117
You got to wear this
from now on.

23:41.119 --> 23:44.086
I don't care if it's not
the law. It's our law.

23:44.088 --> 23:46.157
Plus, look how cute it is.

23:48.493 --> 23:49.559
Yeah.

23:49.561 --> 23:51.127
Happy birthday.

23:51.129 --> 23:53.429
I actually got you
a little gift, too, Charlie.

23:53.431 --> 23:56.501
I mean, it's small,
but, it's from the heart.

24:02.974 --> 24:05.108
A smile is a powerful thing.

24:06.109 --> 24:07.642
It releases endorphins.

24:07.644 --> 24:10.847
It says to the world,
"I'm fun and approachable."

24:12.883 --> 24:17.285
You know, there's a whole chapter in here
about how people who smile more often

24:17.287 --> 24:19.088
actually have more friends.

24:19.823 --> 24:21.256
That's unbelievable.

24:21.258 --> 24:23.223
I really think it's gonna
change your whole outlook

24:23.225 --> 24:24.494
if you smile more often.

24:41.911 --> 24:43.379
I want the Beetle.

24:44.313 --> 24:46.480
- What?
- The yellow Beetle, I want it.

24:46.482 --> 24:48.716
I'll make you a deal. If I get
that thing started, it's mine.

24:48.718 --> 24:51.652
That's no deal. That's
just you taking my car.

24:51.654 --> 24:55.656
If I get it started, I keep it and
I work here every day for a year!

24:55.658 --> 24:57.791
I'll scrub the grease
off the floors, okay?

24:57.793 --> 25:00.894
I will pick up and organize every
scrap of paper in this place.

25:00.896 --> 25:04.633
I'll even detail your
horrible, disgusting toilets.

25:06.835 --> 25:08.803
Please.
It's my birthday.

25:09.638 --> 25:10.905
Sorry, no deal.

25:12.139 --> 25:14.141
'Cause we ain't hiring.

25:15.142 --> 25:17.679
It's yours, kid.
Happy birthday.

25:20.782 --> 25:21.783
Thank you.

25:23.952 --> 25:26.085
Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

25:26.087 --> 25:28.222
And my toilets are gorgeous.

What?

28:04.807 --> 28:06.273
Oh, my God.

28:30.298 --> 28:31.864
Charlie,
what was that noise?

28:31.866 --> 28:34.099
Nothing! I'm fine. Mom, you should
go back to bed. Everything's fine.

28:34.101 --> 28:36.835
- What the hell is that?
- Um, it's...

28:36.837 --> 28:40.004
What is that car doing
in our garage?

28:40.006 --> 28:41.108
Car?

28:42.342 --> 28:44.878
Oh, that, uh, car

28:46.046 --> 28:47.612
is my car.

28:47.614 --> 28:49.581
Uncle Hank gave it to me.

28:49.583 --> 28:51.816
- It runs.
- Yeah.

28:51.818 --> 28:53.417
Those aren't safe.

28:53.419 --> 28:55.954
I wish you would've told me
before you brought it home.

28:55.956 --> 28:57.690
Okay. Sorry.

28:58.624 --> 29:00.158
Um, I'm in the middle
of some stuff, Mom.

29:00.160 --> 29:03.161
Okay, I'll get out
of your hair, but...

29:03.163 --> 29:05.996
Tell me things sometime.

29:05.998 --> 29:07.600
- I'm your mother.
- Okay.

29:07.933 --> 29:09.466
Okay.

29:09.468 --> 29:10.634
Good night.

29:10.636 --> 29:13.704
- It really runs?
- Yeah, it really runs.

29:13.706 --> 29:14.707
Cool.

29:25.650 --> 29:27.317
You still in there?

29:31.056 --> 29:32.388
Okay.

29:32.390 --> 29:34.459
A little jumpy. I'm sorry.

29:44.869 --> 29:45.870
Okay.

30:11.361 --> 30:12.561
Hi.

30:25.309 --> 30:27.009
Oh, God, are you...

30:29.912 --> 30:31.514
Do you speak?

30:43.993 --> 30:45.460
I won't hurt you.

31:11.019 --> 31:12.988
Can you understand me?

31:18.293 --> 31:19.860
What are you?

31:21.495 --> 31:23.163
Where did you come from?

31:24.366 --> 31:26.064
Okay. It's okay.

31:35.142 --> 31:36.642
You like my shirt?

31:37.344 --> 31:38.778
You a metal fan?

31:39.413 --> 31:40.680
No, wait...

31:41.415 --> 31:43.150

31:57.697 --> 31:59.866
Actually, it's
my birthday today.

32:01.968 --> 32:03.102
What's your name?

32:06.506 --> 32:08.974
You don't know
or you don't have a name?

32:13.779 --> 32:16.014
You sound like
a little bumblebee.

32:18.850 --> 32:21.053
I'm gonna call you that
from now on.

32:23.989 --> 32:25.090
Bumblebee.

32:27.125 --> 32:28.624
Matches your outfit, too.

32:47.778 --> 32:52.582
<i>♪ All my exes live in Texas ♪</i>

32:55.286 --> 32:56.819
I want a divorce, Roy!

32:56.821 --> 32:58.987
Come on, Amber.
Give me one good reason.

32:58.989 --> 33:01.123
You tried to sleep
with my sister!

33:01.125 --> 33:02.524
Unsuccessfully!

33:02.526 --> 33:04.992
Yeah, you're unsuccessful
at everything.

33:04.994 --> 33:07.662
That down payment was for a house.
You bought a car.

33:07.664 --> 33:11.199
How stupid are you, Roy?
We don't need a car. God!

33:11.201 --> 33:14.804
Now, just settle down for
one second and hear me out.

33:16.639 --> 33:19.342
- What the hell is that?
- What?

33:22.245 --> 33:25.346
Oh, God, Roy, that thing
is coming right for us!

33:25.348 --> 33:27.148
No, no, no, no, no...

33:27.150 --> 33:28.949
Not my car. Not my car.

33:28.951 --> 33:31.287
Please, God, no, not my car!

33:42.264 --> 33:44.266
Oh, thank God, my car.

33:45.067 --> 33:46.700
Yeah, I'm okay.

33:46.702 --> 33:49.770
Oh, that's good, baby.
That's good.

33:50.738 --> 33:52.374
Run. Run!

34:04.386 --> 34:05.653
Oh...

34:07.788 --> 34:10.291
God!

34:11.726 --> 34:13.194
Is that my car?

34:16.164 --> 34:17.231
Hello...

34:31.612 --> 34:32.710
Jeez!

34:32.712 --> 34:34.245
Earth.

34:34.246 --> 34:36.181
- Roy!
- Oh!

34:36.183 --> 34:37.581
How underwhelming.

34:37.583 --> 34:41.121
The indigenous life is even
more primitive than I expected.

34:42.922 --> 34:44.054
Hey...

34:46.926 --> 34:49.460
Hmm. I like
the way they pop.

34:49.462 --> 34:51.061
Focus, comrade.

34:51.063 --> 34:56.467
B-127's distress signal came from
the western coast of this continent.

34:56.469 --> 34:59.205
For now, we head west.

35:13.319 --> 35:15.718
When do they start
letting you use nunchucks?

35:15.720 --> 35:17.187
I don't know,
but I hope soon.

35:17.189 --> 35:19.991
- Morning! See you guys later.
- Where you off to so fast?

35:20.858 --> 35:23.061
Nowhere. Have a nice day.

35:25.230 --> 35:26.464
Morning...

35:29.033 --> 35:30.134
Bee?

35:32.804 --> 35:34.470
Bee, where are you?

35:37.275 --> 35:39.642
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

35:39.644 --> 35:40.710
Bee!

35:40.712 --> 35:42.380
Where did you go?

35:48.185 --> 35:49.884
Otis!

35:49.886 --> 35:51.786
Have you seen my car?

35:51.788 --> 35:52.988
Unfortunately, yes.

35:52.990 --> 35:55.090
No, have you seen
my car today?

35:55.092 --> 35:57.392
It was in the garage.
Someone stole it!

35:57.394 --> 35:59.060
No, idiot. Mom took it.

35:59.062 --> 36:00.528
She had to bring Conan to the vet

36:00.530 --> 36:02.631
because he swallowed, like,
a rubber glove or something

36:02.633 --> 36:04.499
and Ron needed
the station wagon.

36:04.501 --> 36:05.935
Thank God.

36:08.472 --> 36:09.805
Wait.

36:15.211 --> 36:17.344
Hi. Excuse me.
It's me again.

36:17.346 --> 36:19.614
- We never officially met, but...
- I can't right now. Sorry.

36:19.616 --> 36:21.282
Nope. Yep.

36:21.284 --> 36:22.783
Okay.

36:26.422 --> 36:28.291
I know, buddy. Hang in there.

36:30.760 --> 36:32.959
You can't eat
everything you see.

36:32.961 --> 36:36.097
Just let this be
a good life lesson for you.

36:37.999 --> 36:40.969
Oh, my God. Stop it!
Don't do that!

36:45.440 --> 36:46.441
Bee, no!

36:52.213 --> 36:53.214
- Mom?
- Whoa!

36:54.082 --> 36:56.582
Jesus! Charlie,
what are you doing?

36:56.584 --> 36:57.916
Mom, you gotta pull over.

36:57.918 --> 37:00.886
- What the hell is going on?
- Just pull the car over.

37:00.888 --> 37:03.824
Okay, okay. All right.

37:06.394 --> 37:10.362
Would you put that robot junk away?
What are you thinking?

37:10.364 --> 37:11.963
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

37:11.965 --> 37:13.465
I thought
I was being carjacked.

37:13.467 --> 37:15.067
I'm taking the dog to the vet.

37:15.069 --> 37:19.137
I can't believe you would take him
without me. Mom, I'm so worried about him!

37:19.139 --> 37:20.906
He's my dog, too, you know.

37:20.908 --> 37:23.508
What happened to Conan
being Otis's dog?

37:23.510 --> 37:25.410
Mom, you're
being hysterical, okay?

37:25.412 --> 37:27.713
You should not be driving
in such an emotional state.

37:27.715 --> 37:29.550
I know how you get
during emergencies.

37:30.417 --> 37:31.552
I'm a nurse.

37:33.420 --> 37:34.887
Not of animals.

37:38.759 --> 37:42.393
Oh, okay. I'm happy
for you to drive.

37:42.395 --> 37:44.730
You weren't wearing
your helmet, by the way.

37:44.732 --> 37:46.299
- I saw that.
- Oh, shoot.

37:49.268 --> 37:50.801
Keep it together, Bee.

37:58.444 --> 37:59.445
Sir?

38:00.646 --> 38:01.846
Sir.

38:01.848 --> 38:04.249
I thought you'd want
to see this immediately.

38:09.187 --> 38:11.054
- They sure?
- Yes, sir.

38:11.056 --> 38:13.189
Two of them just
made contact in Texas.

38:13.191 --> 38:15.425
Intel says they're heading
west fast.

38:15.427 --> 38:17.028
Saddle up, Simmons.

38:17.863 --> 38:19.431
We're going to Texas.

38:21.266 --> 38:24.201
Okay, Bee, we need
to go over a few things.

38:30.107 --> 38:31.976
Okay. We're all clear.

38:34.478 --> 38:37.546
All right.
I'm re-thinking the beach.

38:37.548 --> 38:38.549
Ugh.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.984
Oh, I'm good.

38:41.986 --> 38:43.587
No, I'm good, thanks.

38:45.656 --> 38:49.525
People can be terrible about
things they don't understand.

38:49.527 --> 38:52.226
If they find you, they'll probably
lock you up in a lab somewhere

38:52.228 --> 38:53.928
and cut you
into tiny little pieces.

38:53.930 --> 38:57.000
It'll be bad, trust me.

39:00.303 --> 39:04.240
The only person you can show
yourself around is me, okay?

39:06.309 --> 39:08.509
So let's practice.
You ready?

39:08.511 --> 39:10.580
If you see anyone besides me,
what do you do?

39:13.850 --> 39:16.185
Great. Perfect.
Come back now.

39:18.253 --> 39:21.121
Okay, so let's say we're
driving and all of a sudden...

39:21.123 --> 39:23.660
Oh, shoot! Somebody's here!
Hide, Bee, hide!

39:36.071 --> 39:37.539
You serious?

39:41.477 --> 39:44.011
Bee, it's too late.
You're already dead.

39:47.883 --> 39:49.281
It's all right.

39:49.283 --> 39:53.219
That's why we're practicing.
You'll get it.

39:53.221 --> 39:57.024
<i>Fox-2 on approach.
Non-biologicals are inbound.</i>

40:13.574 --> 40:17.442
The goal, sir, should be
to communicate with them.

40:17.444 --> 40:21.045
First contact
with an alien species.

40:21.047 --> 40:24.115
I've spent my whole life
waiting for this moment.

40:24.117 --> 40:27.320
If they make one wrong move,
we put 'em down.

40:42.469 --> 40:45.937
The humans are multiplying.
Please let me kill them.

40:45.939 --> 40:49.542
Not yet. B-127's
signal has gone silent.

40:50.676 --> 40:52.411
I have an idea.

40:53.612 --> 40:57.314
Listen up! I'm Agent Burns
and this is Dr. Powell.

40:57.316 --> 41:01.117
We currently have 100 guns
pointed right at your head!

41:01.119 --> 41:03.020
So state your business.

41:03.022 --> 41:04.888
People of Earth,

41:04.890 --> 41:09.091
we are Decepticon peacekeepers
patrolling the galaxy.

41:09.093 --> 41:11.028
What are you doing?

41:11.030 --> 41:13.095
This is humiliating.

41:13.097 --> 41:16.232
We believe a dangerous
criminal from our world

41:16.234 --> 41:19.368
is hiding somewhere
on yours.

41:19.370 --> 41:21.239
How is it you think
we can help?

41:22.774 --> 41:25.176
We need your eyes.

41:25.843 --> 41:27.176
Wait.

41:27.178 --> 41:29.445
You want access
to our satellites?

41:29.447 --> 41:32.113
Our scanners'
range is limited.

41:32.115 --> 41:35.450
Your infrastructure
is primitive.

41:35.452 --> 41:39.321
But combined, they
could be quite powerful.

41:39.323 --> 41:40.957
No way!
Out of the question!

41:40.959 --> 41:43.926
We have a common enemy,
Agent Burns.

41:43.928 --> 41:46.261
There's a war raging
on our planet.

41:46.263 --> 41:51.067
If B-127 isn't found, that
war may find its way here.

41:51.069 --> 41:53.201
Perhaps...

41:53.203 --> 41:56.404
We can find a way
to help one another.

41:56.406 --> 41:58.305
We'll talk it over
with our superiors.

41:58.307 --> 42:01.342
In the meantime,
if you could follow us.

42:01.344 --> 42:04.012
Very well,
friend Powell.

42:04.014 --> 42:05.849
Take us to your leader.

42:16.492 --> 42:19.495
Must suck being
cooped up in a VW all day, huh?

42:21.030 --> 42:23.364
Is there anyone
that can help you?

42:23.366 --> 42:24.999
Do you have a family?

42:25.001 --> 42:28.102
You know, like a mom,
dad, siblings?

42:28.104 --> 42:29.504
You all love each other?

42:32.041 --> 42:33.473
Or drive each other crazy

42:33.475 --> 42:36.311
and you can't wait to get away
and start a whole new life.

42:42.384 --> 42:44.319
Do you want me
to see if I can fix it?

42:46.421 --> 42:48.256
I'll be gentle, I promise.

42:58.133 --> 42:59.331
Whoa.

43:03.004 --> 43:04.571
You lay down, okay?

43:08.109 --> 43:09.443
Hold still.

43:12.147 --> 43:13.914
I think maybe
there's something...

43:25.625 --> 43:31.228
<i>B-127,
I pray this message finds you.</i>

43:31.230 --> 43:34.799
<i>Our war rages on.</i>

43:34.801 --> 43:36.269
<i>...planet Earth...</i>

43:37.236 --> 43:38.638

44:32.690 --> 44:34.056
Are you okay?

44:37.061 --> 44:38.694
Who was that?

44:38.696 --> 44:41.699
That voice said something
about a war.

44:43.033 --> 44:44.634
Do you remember anything?

44:48.172 --> 44:52.042
Is the VW Beetle
some kind of disguise?

44:53.510 --> 44:55.445
Are you hiding
from something?

44:58.448 --> 44:59.816
Are you scared?

45:12.427 --> 45:13.763
It's broken.

45:15.965 --> 45:17.330
It's okay.

45:17.332 --> 45:19.399
I think I can help.

45:20.936 --> 45:22.371
Let's go home.

45:27.142 --> 45:29.142
<i>...and a basket case,</i>

45:29.144 --> 45:30.744

45:30.746 --> 45:32.546

- All right, I'm almost done.

45:32.548 --> 45:34.049
<i>Does that
answer your question?</i>

45:34.883 --> 45:35.949
No way.

45:35.951 --> 45:37.117

watching it?

45:56.003 --> 45:57.805
<i>You got this, Charlie girl!</i>

46:01.642 --> 46:03.209
<i>All right, Charlie girl!</i>

46:04.979 --> 46:06.245
<i>Hello, Brighton Falls.</i>

46:06.247 --> 46:08.113
<i>This is Charlie Watson,
future Olympic gold medalist.</i>

46:08.115 --> 46:09.514
<i>That was so perfect.</i>

46:09.516 --> 46:11.516
- <i>Thanks, Dad.</i>
- <i>How do you feel?</i>

46:11.518 --> 46:13.520
No, no,
why would you play this?

46:17.090 --> 46:18.825
Sorry. I just...

46:19.860 --> 46:20.961
I finished.

46:25.665 --> 46:27.601
Let's see
if we got something.

46:30.737 --> 46:31.872
Okay.

46:41.281 --> 46:42.615
Okay.

46:43.350 --> 46:44.817
All right.

46:50.756 --> 46:52.823
Oh, my God, yes!

46:52.825 --> 46:54.159
It worked!

46:54.927 --> 46:57.060

47:58.688 --> 48:01.224
Hey, hey, please don't touch those.

48:06.729 --> 48:08.965
They belonged to my dad.

48:27.649 --> 48:29.050
Do you want to hear it?

48:51.306 --> 48:54.039

49:44.790 --> 49:46.725
He died of a heart attack.

49:48.860 --> 49:50.896
I never got
to say goodbye.

49:54.566 --> 49:57.202
You know, I always
thought if I could just

49:58.236 --> 50:00.772
finish fixing this car...

50:03.975 --> 50:07.578
If I could just get it
to start up again,

50:09.081 --> 50:10.681
he would hear me.

50:13.084 --> 50:14.785
He would hear me.

50:53.022 --> 50:55.289

50:55.291 --> 50:56.891
Have you lost your damn mind?

50:56.893 --> 50:59.594
- That was with all due respect?
- The man's got a point, Doctor.

50:59.596 --> 51:03.331
Our satellite network is at the
forefront of our national defense.

51:03.333 --> 51:07.235
Sir, please. It could be a
once in a lifetime opportunity.

51:07.237 --> 51:10.937
Can you imagine the advances an alliance
with these creatures might bring?

51:10.939 --> 51:14.241
I imagine the advances.
An advance on Washington.

51:14.243 --> 51:17.077
- New York. An advance on Chicago!
- That's not gonna happen.

51:17.079 --> 51:19.880
They literally call
themselves "Decepticons."

51:19.882 --> 51:21.515
That doesn't set off
any red flags?

51:21.517 --> 51:24.251
Enough! From both of you.

51:24.253 --> 51:25.651
Sir,

51:25.653 --> 51:29.957
we're talking about the most
advanced robotic system ever seen.

51:30.459 --> 51:32.057
If we tell them no,

51:32.059 --> 51:35.562
they'll just take their technology
to the Russians instead.

51:37.366 --> 51:41.033
Do you really want to go down in history
as the man who cost us the Cold War?

51:43.404 --> 51:44.438
Fine.

51:45.439 --> 51:48.042
We'll help them
find their fugitive.

51:48.576 --> 51:50.242
And when it's done,

51:50.244 --> 51:52.380
you can do all the
experiments you want. Hmm?

51:55.516 --> 51:56.716
Yes, sir.

51:57.784 --> 52:00.854
Gentle... Uh, Robots.

52:02.657 --> 52:04.856
Welcome to Sector 7.

52:04.858 --> 52:07.959
How kind of you
to finally allow us in.

52:07.961 --> 52:10.929
We're very happy
to have you here as friends.

52:10.931 --> 52:12.797
Thank you, friend Powell.

52:12.799 --> 52:17.135
My superior has agreed to grant you
limited access to our satellites.

52:17.137 --> 52:22.340
In addition, you're welcome to
use all of our technology here.

52:22.342 --> 52:25.543
It's the largest super-array
of Crays on Earth.

52:25.545 --> 52:27.978
We thank you
for your hospitality.

52:27.980 --> 52:32.916
Tell me, those vocal
communication devices you use,

52:32.918 --> 52:34.885
do they function worldwide?

52:34.887 --> 52:37.823
The telephones? Yes, why?

52:43.829 --> 52:45.128
You got to pick
a station, man.

52:45.130 --> 52:46.796
I know there's
a lot of choices.

52:46.798 --> 52:48.632
"You want to go
on a date with me, maybe?"

52:50.369 --> 52:51.535
Okay, uh...

52:53.472 --> 52:54.937
What are you trying to do?

52:54.939 --> 52:56.707
Here we go. Here we go.

52:56.709 --> 52:59.141
You're not a nerd. You're not a nerd.
You're not a nerd. You're not a nerd.

52:59.143 --> 53:01.811
Okay, you're a nerd, but just don't
let her see that you're nerdy.

53:01.813 --> 53:04.180
Excuse me. Sorry to barge in.
I just...

53:06.684 --> 53:08.484
Um...

53:08.486 --> 53:09.685
Do you, just...

53:09.687 --> 53:11.786
No, no,
it's fine! Just...

53:11.788 --> 53:15.224
Just sit down, please?
Shh, don't scream, okay?

53:15.226 --> 53:16.692
What is that?

53:16.694 --> 53:19.027
It's okay, okay?
Just breathe. Breathe.

53:19.029 --> 53:21.432

- Hi.

53:25.403 --> 53:27.271
Hi, Memo. Um...

It's nice to meet you.

53:30.040 --> 53:31.573
Pleasure... Pleasure...

53:31.575 --> 53:35.245
Look, I know what you saw was
a little crazy. I can explain.

53:37.047 --> 53:38.980
Yeah, I can't explain.
But here's the deal.

53:38.982 --> 53:40.715
If you tell anyone
what you just saw,

53:40.717 --> 53:42.785
I'm gonna have to
run you over with my car.

53:45.188 --> 53:46.254
Jeez.

53:46.256 --> 53:47.589
That was...

53:47.591 --> 53:48.856
I don't mean that
in a mean way.

53:48.858 --> 53:50.458
Okay? What I'm saying

53:50.460 --> 53:54.230
is no one can know
what you just saw, okay?

53:56.265 --> 53:57.400
You promise?

53:59.068 --> 54:00.134
Yeah.

54:00.136 --> 54:01.602
Okay.

54:01.604 --> 54:03.005
Okay.

54:06.075 --> 54:08.577
Bumblebee,
you can come out now.

54:15.685 --> 54:17.850

He.

54:20.723 --> 54:22.023
Wow.

54:26.928 --> 54:30.831
He's been going up and down on that
dial all day today and I don't know why.

54:33.134 --> 54:35.270
- Hey, check out his reflexes.
- What?

54:36.271 --> 54:38.904
Oh! Oh, God!

54:38.906 --> 54:40.473
- Yo, give me your shirt.
- Huh?

54:40.475 --> 54:41.774
Give me your shirt.

54:41.776 --> 54:43.075
You mean the shirt
that I'm wearing?

54:43.077 --> 54:44.777
Yes, yes! Come on.
I'll give it back to you.

54:44.779 --> 54:46.011
Okay.

54:46.013 --> 54:48.415
Come on!
Give me your shirt!

54:54.288 --> 54:55.489
All right.

55:00.927 --> 55:03.762
Wait, wait, wait! Hey, no, no!
You don't need to do this.

55:03.764 --> 55:06.163
- Yes, I do.
- No, but...

55:06.165 --> 55:09.100
- Come here. Come on!
- No, I get it. I get it!

55:09.102 --> 55:10.604
Whoo-hoo!

55:11.337 --> 55:12.506
Oh.

55:16.242 --> 55:17.641
Sorry.

55:17.643 --> 55:21.080

He's a weird guy. You ever
notice that about Powell?

56:01.386 --> 56:04.987
They're tracking
fluctuations in Energon levels.

56:04.989 --> 56:08.658

You've given them our satellites,
our comms, God knows what else.

56:18.502 --> 56:21.870
Yet in the space of a day
they've given us a way

56:21.872 --> 56:26.508
to not only hunt down B-127,
but all of them.

56:27.778 --> 56:32.013
Let them finish what they're doing.
Let them find B-127.

56:32.015 --> 56:35.016
And then I'll give you
permission to destroy them all.

56:35.018 --> 56:37.220
Use them for spare parts.

56:38.455 --> 56:39.924
Sir, yes, sir.

56:41.224 --> 56:43.691
So you have no idea

56:43.693 --> 56:45.193
No idea.

01:14:25.882 --> 01:14:26.948
What's going on?

01:14:28.451 --> 01:14:29.350
Hey!

01:14:29.352 --> 01:14:31.119
- Come on!
- Stop it!

01:14:31.788 --> 01:14:33.420
Let go of me!

01:14:34.289 --> 01:14:36.691
- Weapons now! Take it down!
- Run!

01:14:36.693 --> 01:14:38.558
No, don't run.
Do not run!

01:14:42.431 --> 01:14:43.497
She ran.

01:15:07.021 --> 01:15:08.623
Please tell me
they're on our side.

01:15:21.636 --> 01:15:23.636
No more running.

01:15:23.638 --> 01:15:25.738
No more hiding.

01:15:29.276 --> 01:15:34.013
B-127, you're a traitor
and a coward.

01:15:34.015 --> 01:15:36.416
Tell us where
Optimus Prime is hiding.

01:15:39.452 --> 01:15:41.488
Bee, look out!

01:15:43.223 --> 01:15:45.223
Why isn't he fighting back?

01:15:45.225 --> 01:15:47.090
Why don't you fight?

01:15:47.092 --> 01:15:48.695
Leave him alone!
Please!

01:15:52.699 --> 01:15:54.131
Again.

01:15:57.503 --> 01:15:58.504
Hit it again!

01:16:00.006 --> 01:16:01.605
Stop! Stop it!

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:35.004
Your daughter stole
government property, Mrs. Watson.

01:16:35.006 --> 01:16:37.306
She's been
having trouble adjusting,

01:16:37.308 --> 01:16:40.009
but we had no idea
it was this serious.

01:16:40.011 --> 01:16:41.242
I...

01:16:41.244 --> 01:16:42.645
Charlie. Honey.

01:16:42.647 --> 01:16:45.815
I didn't steal anything,
and he doesn't belong to them.

01:16:45.817 --> 01:16:47.215
- "He?"
- Ma'am.

01:16:47.217 --> 01:16:49.618
I can assure you
that it is an "it".

01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:51.754
And "it" is a highly dangerous
war machine.

01:16:51.756 --> 01:16:55.091
No, he isn't, okay, Mom?
He's not some "war machine."

01:16:55.093 --> 01:16:58.526
I don't know
what he is, but...

01:16:58.528 --> 01:17:00.228
He's my friend.

01:17:00.230 --> 01:17:03.098
Ma'am, your daughter's had
a traumatic experience today.

01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:05.300
Maybe doesn't understand
everything she's seen.

01:17:05.302 --> 01:17:06.601
She's disoriented.

01:17:06.603 --> 01:17:09.269
No, I'm fine, Mom.
I'm completely fine, okay?

01:17:09.271 --> 01:17:12.139
You have to believe me, please.
I didn't steal anything!

01:17:12.141 --> 01:17:14.477
Stop! Just go
to your room.

01:17:21.484 --> 01:17:23.552
When I was going
through puberty,

01:17:24.787 --> 01:17:26.854
I stole things, too.

01:17:26.856 --> 01:17:29.725
- Stole a box of Mallomars once.
- Yeah, we know.

01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:14.501
Boom.

01:18:15.569 --> 01:18:17.170
Caught you.

01:18:17.172 --> 01:18:19.105
Oh, Mom's gonna love this.

01:18:19.107 --> 01:18:20.872
Look, Otis, you need
to go home and...

01:18:20.874 --> 01:18:22.374
Mom!

01:18:22.376 --> 01:18:25.276
No, Otis, stop it! Why would you do that?

01:18:25.278 --> 01:18:28.013
Let go of me! You're touching my buttocks!

01:18:28.015 --> 01:18:30.851
I will tell you a secret
if you shut up.

01:18:32.052 --> 01:18:35.921
Okay, so, um,
this is my room.

01:18:35.923 --> 01:18:37.588
Just make yourself at home.

01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:39.690
These are actually
my sister's stuff.

01:18:39.692 --> 01:18:42.660
She likes playing pranks, like
putting her stuff over here.

01:18:42.662 --> 01:18:44.862
- Can I, uh, sit down?
- Yeah, yeah. Mmm-hmm.

01:18:44.864 --> 01:18:46.530
<i>Residents of
Brighton Falls have been witness</i>

01:18:46.532 --> 01:18:48.933
<i>to an unusual sight
this evening.</i>

01:18:48.935 --> 01:18:52.436
<i>Armed Forces pouring into town
as part of what we are told</i>

01:18:52.438 --> 01:18:55.338
<i>is a routine military exercise</i>

01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:58.075
<i>setting up camp
at our own McKinnon Air Base.</i>

01:18:58.077 --> 01:19:01.344
If Bumblebee's still alive,
that's where they're keeping him.

01:19:01.346 --> 01:19:03.446
We have to go.
We have to try and save him.

01:19:03.448 --> 01:19:05.350
Count me in. I'll take point.

01:19:06.351 --> 01:19:08.018
- No, you won't.
- Come on.

01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:09.452
No, Otis.

01:19:09.454 --> 01:19:11.855
- But I can help. Master Larry says I...
- I need someone here.

01:19:11.857 --> 01:19:16.059
I need someone reliable to make sure that
Mom and Ron don't know that I'm gone.

01:19:16.061 --> 01:19:17.562
I'm someone reliable.

01:19:19.296 --> 01:19:20.665
Hell, yeah, you are.

01:19:25.604 --> 01:19:26.805
Good luck.

01:19:27.338 --> 01:19:28.938
You, too.

01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:30.407
Get over here.

01:19:35.247 --> 01:19:36.612
Oh.

01:19:36.614 --> 01:19:37.782
Let's do this.

01:19:40.351 --> 01:19:41.416
Tell us where

01:19:41.418 --> 01:19:43.418
Optimus Prime
and the rebels are hiding,

01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:46.390
and we can end this war.

01:19:48.626 --> 01:19:49.491
Talk!

01:19:49.493 --> 01:19:51.727
Who is Optimus Prime?

01:19:51.729 --> 01:19:54.330
This doesn't
concern you, human Powell.

01:19:54.698 --> 01:19:56.801
Last chance.

01:20:03.174 --> 01:20:05.773
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

01:20:05.775 --> 01:20:07.875
It's a terrible idea,
but I've got to try it.

01:20:07.877 --> 01:20:10.578
You can't get... Well, why
don't you... Stop, stop, wait...

01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:13.683
- How'd you know the power was off?
- I didn't. Let's go.

01:20:19.255 --> 01:20:20.520
Can I?

01:20:20.522 --> 01:20:22.792
His memory cells are fried.

01:20:23.659 --> 01:20:24.926
Finish him.

01:20:31.167 --> 01:20:36.369
<i>We will fight on. Regroup,
rebuild, and retake our home.</i>

01:20:36.371 --> 01:20:38.972
<i>But we must find refuge first.</i>

01:20:38.974 --> 01:20:40.574
<i>You will travel to Earth.</i>

01:20:40.576 --> 01:20:43.276
<i>Once we've gathered
the others, we'll join you.</i>

01:20:43.278 --> 01:20:45.477
<i>You must protect the planet.</i>

01:20:45.479 --> 01:20:51.051
<i>If the Decepticons find it, then
our people are truly finished.</i>

01:20:51.053 --> 01:20:53.320
<i>Stay safe, soldier.</i>

01:20:53.322 --> 01:20:55.723
<i>I am coming.</i>

01:20:57.391 --> 01:21:00.025
Prime is coming here?

01:21:00.027 --> 01:21:02.228
They're all coming here.

01:21:02.230 --> 01:21:06.465
This is our chance to wipe out
the Autobot resistance for good.

01:21:06.467 --> 01:21:10.102
We'll burn the whole
planet to cinders.

01:21:10.104 --> 01:21:12.503
We must get word
to Cybertron immediately.

01:21:12.505 --> 01:21:13.638
<i>This is Burns.</i>

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:16.342
Tell them to bring an army.

01:21:16.344 --> 01:21:18.743
Burns, we made
a terrible mistake.

01:21:18.745 --> 01:21:19.844
Powell?

01:21:19.846 --> 01:21:22.680
And thanks to
our human allies,

01:21:22.682 --> 01:21:25.184
I know just how to get
the message home.

01:21:25.186 --> 01:21:27.485
They're using our satellites.

01:21:27.487 --> 01:21:29.053
<i>They're calling an army.</i>

01:21:29.055 --> 01:21:31.322
They're gonna kill us all.

01:21:31.324 --> 01:21:36.294
Thank you for your
hospitality, friend Powell.

01:21:36.296 --> 01:21:37.864
He's all yours.

01:21:39.199 --> 01:21:40.430
- No.
- <i>Powell?</i>

01:21:40.432 --> 01:21:41.966
- <i>You have to stop them!</i>
- Powell!

01:21:46.505 --> 01:21:47.871
Where's the Krazy Glue?

01:21:47.873 --> 01:21:50.509
What, did she cut
the wire to the TV?

01:21:50.943 --> 01:21:52.476
Ron.

01:21:52.478 --> 01:21:54.878
Charlie!

01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:55.946
Charlie!

01:21:55.948 --> 01:21:59.451
Nice! Reel-to-reel still works.

01:22:00.286 --> 01:22:02.886
Where is
your sister?

01:22:02.888 --> 01:22:06.223
Charlie's fallen ill and must stay in
her bedroom for the rest of the evening.

01:22:06.225 --> 01:22:10.060
She wishes not to be troubled.
Keep clear of her chambers.

01:22:10.062 --> 01:22:11.096
What?

01:22:15.367 --> 01:22:16.799
Charlie has fallen ill

01:22:16.801 --> 01:22:19.669
and must stay in her bedroom
for the rest of the evening.

01:22:19.671 --> 01:22:22.204
- She wishes not to...
- Otis!

01:22:22.206 --> 01:22:24.374
Are you on drugs? Hmm?

01:22:24.376 --> 01:22:25.808
No, no. Mom, Mom, Mom.

01:22:25.810 --> 01:22:27.610
- Please stop. Stop!
- Charlie!

01:22:27.612 --> 01:22:29.712
- Mom, there is no reason to go...
- Where is she?

01:22:29.714 --> 01:22:31.816
- Mom, stop!
- Quit it, Otis.

01:22:37.821 --> 01:22:39.023
Where is she?

01:22:40.191 --> 01:22:41.558
Uh...

01:22:42.726 --> 01:22:44.027
Otis?

01:22:46.530 --> 01:22:49.197
I found a tower
to transmit our message.

01:22:49.199 --> 01:22:51.232
It's close.

01:22:51.234 --> 01:22:55.937
Oh. B-127.
I almost forgot.

01:22:55.939 --> 01:22:57.238
I didn't.

01:22:59.443 --> 01:23:00.978
No! Don't shoot!

01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:04.279
No!

01:23:19.829 --> 01:23:20.963
Bee!

01:23:23.399 --> 01:23:24.934
Talk to me, Bee, talk to me.

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:34.208
I can fix this.
I can fix this.

01:23:38.314 --> 01:23:39.446
Charlie.

01:23:39.448 --> 01:23:42.915
You got to wake up, Bee.
You got to wake up.

01:23:42.917 --> 01:23:43.918
Please.

01:23:45.754 --> 01:23:47.622
Charlie, we got to go.

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:53.426
- The gun.
- What?

01:23:53.428 --> 01:23:54.996
The electric gun. Get it.

01:23:57.165 --> 01:23:58.766
I can fix you.

01:24:01.269 --> 01:24:02.601
Come on, Bee.

01:24:02.603 --> 01:24:04.104
Come back to me.

01:24:10.277 --> 01:24:12.079
Come on, give me
the other one.

01:24:18.385 --> 01:24:20.054
Bee, come on.

01:24:22.189 --> 01:24:23.957
I can't lose you, too, Bee.

01:24:24.391 --> 01:24:25.792
Please, Bee!

01:24:40.006 --> 01:24:41.007
I'm sorry.

01:24:55.154 --> 01:24:56.289
Oh.

01:25:05.997 --> 01:25:07.831
Oh, my God.

01:25:07.833 --> 01:25:10.035
Come on, Bee, we've got
to get you out of here.

01:25:22.247 --> 01:25:25.482
Charlie, there's like
a million guys out there!

01:25:25.484 --> 01:25:27.783
We got to move, now.

01:25:27.785 --> 01:25:29.920
Come on, Bee, you've gotta get up.
Can you get up?

01:25:30.788 --> 01:25:32.790
There's a door in my way.

01:25:35.226 --> 01:25:36.258
They've got bombs!

01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:38.028
- We got to go.
- Bee, come on.

01:25:39.997 --> 01:25:40.929
Charlie!

01:25:40.931 --> 01:25:42.299
You've gotta get up, come on.

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:44.799
- Three.
- Charlie!

01:25:44.801 --> 01:25:46.535
- Two.
- Come on.

01:25:46.537 --> 01:25:47.635
One.

01:25:47.637 --> 01:25:48.972
- Charlie!
- Come on.

01:26:06.022 --> 01:26:07.223
Memo?

01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:13.561
Memo. Memo, wake up.

01:26:15.165 --> 01:26:16.432
Easy.

01:26:19.536 --> 01:26:20.736
Easy.

01:26:23.305 --> 01:26:24.639
Hold your fire!

01:26:24.641 --> 01:26:26.375
Get the kid out of here.

01:26:27.676 --> 01:26:30.877
Memo! Wake up, Memo!

01:26:30.879 --> 01:26:32.145
Come on, kid.

01:26:32.147 --> 01:26:33.315
Hey! No!

01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:35.217
Bee!

01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:36.550
Run!

01:26:38.686 --> 01:26:39.887
Bee!

01:26:41.123 --> 01:26:42.322
Run!

01:26:42.324 --> 01:26:44.293
- Let go of me!
- You need to get away from that thing.

01:26:47.261 --> 01:26:49.397
- Take it down!
- No, stop!

01:26:50.932 --> 01:26:53.732
- Stop it!
- Contain it and dismantle it!

01:26:53.734 --> 01:26:56.035
Strip it down to parts!

01:26:56.037 --> 01:26:58.771
Leave him alone!
You don't understand.

01:27:00.241 --> 01:27:01.739
Fight back, Bee!

01:27:01.741 --> 01:27:04.176
- Bee!
- Kid, stop! It's a machine!

01:27:04.178 --> 01:27:06.711
He's more human
than you'll ever be!

01:27:06.713 --> 01:27:08.813
That is enough!

01:27:31.770 --> 01:27:33.071
Oh, shit.

01:27:44.283 --> 01:27:45.317
Open fire!

01:27:58.464 --> 01:28:00.432
Fall back! Take cover!

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:17.081
Bee!

01:28:19.617 --> 01:28:20.952
Bee!

01:28:23.254 --> 01:28:24.821
Bee, stop!

01:28:44.374 --> 01:28:47.208
You remember, don't you?

01:28:51.648 --> 01:28:53.250
They're coming back.

01:28:58.555 --> 01:28:59.922
Oh, God.

01:29:00.424 --> 01:29:01.891
Are you okay?

01:29:02.526 --> 01:29:05.092
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

01:29:05.094 --> 01:29:07.063
We need to get out of here.

01:29:08.164 --> 01:29:10.166

someplace safe.

01:29:13.536 --> 01:29:16.036

into getting seatbelts.

Oh, my God, oh, my God.

01:30:55.934 --> 01:30:58.201

robot back, fight off the police,

01:30:58.203 --> 01:31:00.303

01:31:00.305 --> 01:31:01.371

- Mom?

01:31:38.843 --> 01:31:41.042
You pull that car over
right this second.

01:31:41.044 --> 01:31:43.211

the other kid! What was I...

01:32:55.148 --> 01:32:56.882
It was a lose-lose.

are you all right?

01:33:00.955 --> 01:33:04.257
