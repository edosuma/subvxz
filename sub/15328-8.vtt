- Hey, hon.

00:03.169 --> 00:06.715
- Hey, babe.

00:06.798 --> 00:09.050
- Aaron, what are
you doing out school?

00:09.134 --> 00:11.886
- He got an award yesterday,
so I'm giving him a ditch day.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.054
- Well, that must have been
some award

00:13.138 --> 00:14.764
to earn a whole day off school.

00:14.848 --> 00:15.849
What was it for?

00:15.932 --> 00:17.308
- Perfect attendance.

00:20.478 --> 00:21.187
- Seriously?

00:21.271 --> 00:22.397
Seriously?

00:22.480 --> 00:23.732
Was that a smart move?

00:23.815 --> 00:24.774
- Are you kidding?

00:24.858 --> 00:27.777
It was genius.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.612
First, Steph drove me
by my school

00:29.696 --> 00:32.615
so we could laugh at everyone
who had to be there.

00:32.698 --> 00:36.286
- I sure did, and then
I said don't tell your dad.

00:36.369 --> 00:38.371
- Wait, she gets smarter.

00:38.455 --> 00:39.748
Then Steph wanted a manicure,

00:39.831 --> 00:44.878
so for me she invented
a boy-acure.

00:44.961 --> 00:47.797
She is the smartest person
I've ever met.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.508
- You know I'm
a surgeon, right?

00:50.592 --> 00:52.135
- Don't be jealous, Charlie.

00:52.218 --> 00:53.720
Green's not a good color on you.

01:08.359 --> 01:10.320
Uh, he's got a cough.

01:10.403 --> 01:12.405
A really bad cough.

01:12.489 --> 01:16.117
I don't know what kind of cough,
I'm not a doctor.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.953
- Tell 'em her
about the boy-acure.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.414

01:29.088 --> 01:32.258
Uh, that is

01:32.342 --> 01:33.843
- Why would you say
whooping cough?

01:33.927 --> 01:37.931
- Because it sounds sicky-er
than a regular cough.

01:38.014 --> 01:40.517
- Wait, is whooping cough
a real thing?

01:40.600 --> 01:41.810

is a serious,

03:49.520 --> 03:52.815
{\an8}How do I add 3/8 plus 5/24?

the same bottom number,

04:26.766 --> 04:28.059

whenever you want.

And by the time I tried them on,
all the blue-bottoms were gone.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.901
so I bought you
your favorite pretzel.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.570

a pair of mom jeans.

18:28.857 --> 18:33.028
- Rodrick's the little fat kid
who ate 12 1/3 cupcakes.

18:33.111 --> 18:37.991
- Mrs. Phillips, my cat
landed on my face at 4 a.m.

18:38.075 --> 18:41.453
This is not the day.

18:41.537 --> 18:42.496
- [buzzer sounds]

18:42.579 --> 18:44.665
- They received 6 3/8 pounds
of candy.

18:44.748 --> 18:45.749
- Correct.

18:45.833 --> 18:46.875
Point teachers.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.043
- [applause]

18:48.126 --> 18:50.712
- Stephanie, does not know math,
does she?

18:50.796 --> 18:53.048
- She does not.

18:53.131 --> 18:55.300
- [sighs] I see.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.719
When this over, can you take me
to go get some muffin baskets

18:57.803 --> 18:58.470
for my teachers?

18:58.554 --> 19:04.309
Because I have said some things.

19:04.393 --> 19:05.769
- I thought
you knew this stuff.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.563
- I do.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.064
Well, I did.

19:09.147 --> 19:11.316
She's asking different questions
than the ones I got from--

19:16.905 --> 19:19.074
- Oooh.

19:19.157 --> 19:22.911
- ♪

19:22.995 --> 19:25.706
- Uh, I guess I should have
gotten you out of gym.

19:25.789 --> 19:27.749
In my defense,
you're usually lying.

19:27.833 --> 19:28.292
- Didn't matter.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.085
Gym got cancelled.

19:30.168 --> 19:33.046
Instead, during history class,
Dodgeball Dave picked up a globe

19:33.130 --> 19:36.133
and threw that at me.

19:36.216 --> 19:37.467
- He hit you with a globe?

19:37.551 --> 19:38.760
- No, I ducked.

19:38.844 --> 19:41.138
But then I ran out the door
and forgot to open it.

19:44.182 --> 19:45.809
- Hey, how'd the Smarty Bowl go?

19:45.893 --> 19:47.936
- Pretty much
blew up in my face.

19:48.020 --> 19:51.231
- A smart parent
would have known not to cheat.

19:51.315 --> 19:52.482
- You know, Charlie?

19:52.566 --> 19:54.651
You're being a real zyquest.

19:54.735 --> 19:57.613
- CHARLIE: Still not a word.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.239
- Stephanie, why didn't you
just tell me

19:59.323 --> 20:00.616
you couldn't do math?

20:00.699 --> 20:02.868
- Well, I liked that you were
getting all excited about me.

20:02.951 --> 20:04.953
- I'll always be excited
about you.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.747
You're Steph.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.957
Anyway, you're good at other
stuff--

20:09.041 --> 20:14.087
mom stuff, fun stuff,
and your skin is fabulous.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.923
- Well, I'm good
at school stuff, too.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.758
Well, everything but math.

20:17.841 --> 20:18.675
- Really?

20:18.759 --> 20:19.760
- Uh, you know it.

20:19.843 --> 20:22.471
- That's great,
because for my science homework,

20:22.554 --> 20:23.889
I have to build
an electrical circuit

20:23.972 --> 20:26.141
that can power a light bulb.

20:26.224 --> 20:28.060
- Oh, good luck to you, buddy.

20:32.230 --> 20:35.984
