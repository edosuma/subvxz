<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.701 --> 00:06.202
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.771 --> 00:10.039
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:10.107 --> 00:12.308
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.376 --> 00:14.711
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.778 --> 00:16.613
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.680 --> 00:19.417
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.485 --> 00:21.485
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.520 --> 00:23.987
<i>A trigger-happy girlfriend...</i>

00:24.055 --> 00:25.622
Should we shoot them?

00:25.690 --> 00:27.423
<i>...an old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:27.491 --> 00:30.193
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.260 --> 00:32.561
<i>...family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:32.628 --> 00:34.496
<i>...if you're desperate....</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:34.564 --> 00:37.633
<i>...and a down-and-out spy</i>
<i>you met along the way.</i>

00:37.700 --> 00:39.267
That's how we do it,
people.

00:39.335 --> 00:41.936
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:42.004 --> 00:43.804
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:46.350 --> 00:48.007
Previously on...
<i>Burn Notice</i>

00:48.581 --> 00:50.348
Welcome home, kid.

00:50.416 --> 00:51.915
You're gonna help me
break in

00:51.983 --> 00:54.251
to the British consulate
right now.

00:54.319 --> 00:55.686
Ohh!

00:55.754 --> 00:58.122
Go get a .50 Cal --
then maybe you got a shot.

00:58.190 --> 01:00.258
I <i>will</i> kill Michael.

01:11.903 --> 01:13.004
Oh, God.

01:13.071 --> 01:14.806
Why did you plant the bomb
in the lobby?

01:14.873 --> 01:16.006
I didn't.

01:16.074 --> 01:17.575
I made one
targeted explosive,

01:17.642 --> 01:18.842
just enough for Larry.

01:18.910 --> 01:21.244
The security guards --
they're dead.

01:21.312 --> 01:25.281
Unless you're willing to see
your girlfriend go to prison

01:25.349 --> 01:29.251
for the rest of her life,
you will do exactly what I say.

01:29.319 --> 01:31.386
He'll keep forcing you
to do his bidding.

01:31.454 --> 01:33.021
There is no end to this.

01:33.088 --> 01:34.922
We just delivered a couple
hundred million dollars

01:34.990 --> 01:36.357
to a very dangerous man.

01:36.425 --> 01:37.725
I am not losing you, Fi.

01:39.429 --> 01:41.329
I <i>know</i> that you're trying
to rebuild the organization

01:41.397 --> 01:42.898
that burned me!
Aah!

01:42.966 --> 01:44.734
Congrats. You're in charge
of an official CIA team

01:44.802 --> 01:46.536
for the first time
since you got burned.

01:46.604 --> 01:49.072
That elite CIA team
you've been running --

01:49.140 --> 01:50.975
they're gonna be
my new starting lineup

01:51.043 --> 01:52.410
because you're gonna
burn them for me.

01:52.477 --> 01:53.911
You want me to betray
my own team?

01:53.979 --> 01:56.381
There has to be a line.

01:56.448 --> 01:58.883
There is no line
when it comes to you!

01:58.951 --> 02:00.718
We'll go to the FBI,
I'll turn myself in,

02:00.786 --> 02:01.753
and we'll
make them understand.

02:01.821 --> 02:03.188
They won't understand us.

02:05.658 --> 02:07.192
Michael!!

02:07.260 --> 02:09.794
Anson, it's over.
One way or another, it's over.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.530
Nobody's getting burned today.

02:11.598 --> 02:12.865
I'll see you in hell!

02:12.933 --> 02:14.934
Pearce, our team
has been compromised!

02:15.002 --> 02:16.870
Things have changed.
There is a new plan.

02:19.507 --> 02:22.609
Michael, that was quite
a disaster at the airport today.

02:22.676 --> 02:25.378
I told you what would happen
if things didn't go well.

02:25.446 --> 02:26.980
Fi, we got to leave.
We got --

02:27.048 --> 02:28.849
Sam! Where's Fi?

02:28.917 --> 02:29.950
She clocked me
with a bottle.

02:30.018 --> 02:31.351
I tried to stop her.

02:31.419 --> 02:32.820
She's turning herself in?
Yeah.

02:32.887 --> 02:33.988
Federal building.

02:34.055 --> 02:35.489
She said
she didn't want to let you

02:35.557 --> 02:37.124
keep working
for Anson anymore.

02:37.192 --> 02:39.927
She didn't want to run
and let the bastard get away.

02:39.995 --> 02:41.829
She left that
for you, Mike.

02:41.896 --> 02:42.830
I'm sorry, Mikey.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.933
I'm so sorry.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.806
Fi!

02:53.874 --> 02:55.641
I'm here to,
uh, surrender.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.844
Hands up! Hands up!
Back of your head now!

02:57.912 --> 03:00.113
Do it now!

03:08.489 --> 03:11.158
Back! Get back!

03:11.226 --> 03:13.994
Suspect is in custody, over.

03:14.062 --> 03:15.263
Suspect is in custody, over.

03:15.330 --> 03:17.665
All personnel,
proceed with caution.

03:17.733 --> 03:19.467
Secure the halls -- now.

03:19.535 --> 03:23.605
Suspect is considered
extremely dangerous.

04:11.020 --> 04:12.987
<i>"I loved you.</i>

04:13.055 --> 04:16.724
<i>"Before I should have,</i>
<i>i trusted you...</i>

04:16.791 --> 04:19.160
<i>"'Cause I've always known</i>
<i>your heart.</i>

04:19.228 --> 04:21.863
<i>You do what's right,</i>
<i>no matter the cost to you."</i>

04:24.300 --> 04:27.136
<i>"And I've learned</i>
<i>that when you love a spy,</i>

04:27.203 --> 04:30.973
<i>you have to be willing</i>
<i>to make that sacrifice, too."</i>

04:34.845 --> 04:36.379
There you are.

04:36.447 --> 04:38.648
Been looking all over
for you.

04:40.084 --> 04:41.318
Is Fi...?

04:41.386 --> 04:43.020
I was too late, Sam.

04:43.088 --> 04:44.989
Look, Mike,
you can't blame yourself.

04:45.057 --> 04:47.092
I mean, there was nothing
you could do.

04:47.160 --> 04:49.394
It wasn't like any of us
could stop her.

04:51.231 --> 04:53.066
What about you, Sam?

04:53.133 --> 04:54.600
What are you
talking about?

04:54.668 --> 04:56.702
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

04:56.770 --> 04:58.504
I-I don't.

04:58.572 --> 05:01.741
You expect me to believe
she knocked you out?

05:01.809 --> 05:03.376
How is that possible?

05:03.444 --> 05:06.713
<i>How</i> is that possible?

05:08.249 --> 05:09.716
Mike, come on, man.

05:09.784 --> 05:11.618
What do you want me
to say?

05:11.686 --> 05:15.122
Okay, yeah, yeah, maybe I could
have fought her off.

05:15.189 --> 05:16.556
That's right.

05:16.624 --> 05:18.625
But did it ever occur to you
that maybe she was right?

05:18.693 --> 05:20.293
You were losing yourself,
Mike.

05:20.361 --> 05:22.663
You were selling out everything
you ever fought for!

05:22.730 --> 05:23.864
I was fighting for her!

05:23.931 --> 05:25.565
By burning spies?

05:25.633 --> 05:30.270
Mike, you were betraying
your friends.

05:30.338 --> 05:33.774
You were about to betray
your goddamn government.

05:35.510 --> 05:37.778
What do I do
now, Sam? What do I do?

05:41.482 --> 05:44.651
I've just been fighting
for so long, Sam.

05:44.718 --> 05:48.421
And she was
all I had left.

05:48.489 --> 05:52.324
Now you're just gonna
have to fight a little more.

05:52.392 --> 05:54.626
I got a call from the CIA team
over at the airport.

05:54.694 --> 05:56.161
They're working
on something.

05:56.229 --> 05:59.998
Let's go, Mike.
This may not be over yet.

06:04.545 --> 06:08.045

06:12.892 --> 06:14.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, got it.
Mike, that was Jesse.

06:14.928 --> 06:17.430
I don't want to get your hopes
up too high here, but, uh...

06:17.498 --> 06:19.098
Sounds like he's got a lead
on Anson.

06:19.166 --> 06:20.333
What?!

06:22.070 --> 06:23.137
Where?!

06:23.205 --> 06:25.105
Mike, warn me
when you're gonna do that?

06:25.173 --> 06:26.407
Where is he, Sam?

06:26.475 --> 06:28.209
Jesse's on the CIA system.

06:28.277 --> 06:29.745
He's tapping
the traffic cams,

06:29.812 --> 06:31.580
and he saw Anson
leaving his apartment

06:31.648 --> 06:33.549
with a get-out-of-town bag
and a fresh shave.

06:33.617 --> 06:34.517
Goodbye, mustache.

06:34.585 --> 06:35.818
As of 20 minutes ago,

06:35.886 --> 06:37.987
he was heading through midtown
in a green Jag.

06:41.591 --> 06:43.859
So, Mike, you know, not to get
ahead of ourselves here --

06:43.927 --> 06:45.127
I mean, what's the plan
if we catch him?

06:45.195 --> 06:46.495
He's the reason
why I lost Fi.

06:46.563 --> 06:47.696
What do you <i>think</i>
<i>the plan is?</i>

06:47.764 --> 06:49.031
Mike, I hate it
when you talk like that.

06:49.099 --> 06:50.867
You don't get to argue,
Sam!

06:50.935 --> 06:52.502
Not on this, not after what
happened today.

06:52.569 --> 06:54.804
See what's going on.

06:54.872 --> 06:56.572
Jesse, what's the latest?

06:56.640 --> 06:58.107
You ask, I deliver.

06:58.175 --> 07:00.676
I just spotted Anson's Jag
on a traffic Cam in Brickell.

07:00.744 --> 07:02.211
He's traveling alone.
Good news is,

07:02.279 --> 07:03.546
he's minding his red lights,
he's going the speed limit.

07:03.614 --> 07:04.714
You should be able
to catch up to him.

07:04.782 --> 07:06.215
He's heading south on 821.

07:06.283 --> 07:07.317
821 South?

07:07.384 --> 07:08.418
You think he's going
to Cutler Bay?

07:08.485 --> 07:09.585
That would be my guess,
yeah.

07:09.653 --> 07:10.987
With the explosion
at the airport,

07:11.055 --> 07:12.889
all the flights in and out
of Miami are grounded.

07:12.957 --> 07:14.557
He's probably trying to hop
a boat out of town.

07:14.625 --> 07:16.993
Yeah, but there's got to be
50 marinas at Cutler alone.

07:17.060 --> 07:18.694
I mean, Anson gets there,
he's gone.

07:18.762 --> 07:21.063
He's not making it
to Cutler Bay.

07:24.601 --> 07:26.869
Talked to
my D.I.A. contacts.

07:26.937 --> 07:28.337
Anson Fullerton
is just a shrink

07:28.405 --> 07:30.173
who debriefs field operatives
and treats PTSD cas--

07:30.240 --> 07:32.475
Believe me -- he does a lot more
than that, okay?

07:32.543 --> 07:34.710
Jesse, I have a rogue agent
on the loose,

07:34.778 --> 07:36.345
a burning plane
on the tarmac,

07:36.413 --> 07:39.516
and the F.A.A. breathing down
my neck to release air traffic.

07:39.583 --> 07:41.651
I'm supposed to just forget
all that and go after <i>this</i> guy?

07:41.719 --> 07:44.455
Yeah. Look,
I know how it sounds.

07:44.522 --> 07:46.090
We're running out of time.
He's heading out of town.

07:46.158 --> 07:47.224
You got to trust me
on this one.

07:47.292 --> 07:48.660
All right,
let's just say I did.

07:48.727 --> 07:49.861
What would you need,
exactly?

07:49.929 --> 07:51.062
Mike and Sam are trying
to cut him off.

07:51.130 --> 07:52.231
As soon as
they have him cornered,

07:52.298 --> 07:53.733
we'll take whatever resources
you got.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.201
Jesse, in case you haven't
noticed, I'm spread pretty thin.

07:56.269 --> 07:57.302
Dani.

07:57.370 --> 07:58.704
I'll do what I can,

07:58.772 --> 08:00.973
but for now,
Michael's on his own.

08:03.443 --> 08:05.744
<i>The vehicle you want</i>
<i>when hunting someone down</i>

08:05.812 --> 08:07.479
<i>depends on where you are</i>
<i>in the chase.</i>

08:07.547 --> 08:09.081
<i>If you're behind your target,</i>

08:09.148 --> 08:12.017
<i>you need a set of wheels</i>
<i>that's fast enough to catch up.</i>

08:12.085 --> 08:14.953
<i>If you're ahead and waiting</i>
<i>for your target to come to you,</i>

08:15.021 --> 08:16.588
<i>you may want to think bigger.</i>

08:20.393 --> 08:21.927
Uh, Mike,
the clock's ticking.

08:21.995 --> 08:24.597
I mean, I thought the idea
was to get ahead of Anson

08:24.665 --> 08:26.332
so we can spot him
from the road.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.868
There are no exits for 10 miles
along that highway.

08:28.936 --> 08:31.003
It'll be a lot easier
if the traffic's stopped.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.307
Oh, great.

08:36.409 --> 08:37.777
<i>Anti-theft devices,</i>

08:37.845 --> 08:40.412
<i>like transponder keys</i>
<i>and transmission locks,</i>

08:40.480 --> 08:43.115
<i>make newer trucks</i>
<i>nearly impossible to steal.</i>

08:43.183 --> 08:45.318
<i>Hot-wiring an older truck,</i>
<i>on the other hand,</i>

08:45.385 --> 08:47.453
<i>is still just a matter</i>
<i>of shorting the terminals</i>

08:47.521 --> 08:48.621
<i>on the starter solenoid.</i>

08:48.689 --> 08:50.157
<i>And, of course,</i>

08:50.224 --> 08:51.458
<i>dealing with whoever happens</i>
<i>to own the truck.</i>

08:51.526 --> 08:52.559
Hey!

08:52.627 --> 08:54.627
What the hell
are you doing?!

08:54.695 --> 08:56.563
Hey, I know
this doesn't look good.

08:56.631 --> 08:57.831
No, this guy's stealing
my truck!

08:57.899 --> 08:59.299
Uh, yeah, he is,
but, see, the thing is,

08:59.367 --> 09:00.767
it's kind of a long story,
and trust me, pal,

09:00.835 --> 09:02.336
you don't want to mess
with that guy right now.

09:02.403 --> 09:03.470
Out of my way!

09:03.537 --> 09:05.105
Can't do that.

09:07.308 --> 09:08.575
Fight's over.
Walk away now.

09:10.545 --> 09:12.680
Here. Buy yourself
another hot dog.

09:12.748 --> 09:14.549
And, uh, you might want to call
your insurance company.

09:14.616 --> 09:16.083
I think you're gonna need
a new truck.

09:35.573 --> 09:37.974
Sam, I need you to
slow down the cars behind me.

09:38.042 --> 09:40.376
You got it, Mike.

09:59.060 --> 10:02.463
Okay, Mike, whatever you're
gonna do, now is the time.

10:02.530 --> 10:04.031
<i>Keeping a large truck stable</i>

10:04.099 --> 10:06.133
<i>is basically about</i>
<i>keeping your speed low</i>

10:06.201 --> 10:07.434
<i>and your turns shallow</i>

10:07.502 --> 10:08.736
<i>so the center of gravity</i>
<i>doesn't shift</i>

10:08.803 --> 10:11.272
<i>further than the vehicle</i>
<i>can handle.</i>

10:16.645 --> 10:17.712
What <i>are</i> you doing?

10:19.814 --> 10:21.615
Oh, boy. Oh --

10:24.385 --> 10:25.952
<i>On the other hand,</i>

10:26.019 --> 10:28.754
<i>speed and sharp turns</i>
<i>are exactly what you need...</i>

10:30.156 --> 10:32.924
<i>...if you want the truck</i>
<i>to jackknife.</i>

10:32.992 --> 10:34.659
Oh! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

10:51.008 --> 10:55.512
<i>An abandoned semi truck will</i>
<i>create an effective barricade.</i>

10:57.282 --> 10:59.216
<i>But if you really want</i>
<i>to tie up traffic,</i>

10:59.284 --> 11:00.918
<i>it helps to give people</i>
<i>a reason</i>

11:00.986 --> 11:02.653
<i>to keep their distance.</i>

11:06.792 --> 11:08.827
That's a hell
of a roadblock, Mike.

11:08.895 --> 11:10.195
Just drive.

11:29.080 --> 11:32.015
Ms. Glenanne --
Agent Jason Bly.

11:32.083 --> 11:33.683
I'm not sure
if you remember me.

11:33.751 --> 11:36.153
I had some dealings with you
and Mr. Westen several --

11:36.221 --> 11:37.521
I remember you.

11:41.060 --> 11:42.127
Yes.

11:42.194 --> 11:44.196
Yes, you clearly do.

11:44.263 --> 11:48.734
I'm on loan here today
from the CSS

11:48.801 --> 11:51.937
because of my, uh, experience
with you and Mr. Westen.

11:52.004 --> 11:53.639
Now, I assume
you've been informed

11:53.706 --> 11:55.073
of your right
to legal counsel.

11:55.141 --> 11:56.375
I don't need a lawyer.

11:56.442 --> 11:59.077
Ohh. That makes things
so much simpler.

11:59.145 --> 12:01.280
Okay. I hear
you want to confess

12:01.347 --> 12:03.783
to the bombing
of the British consulate.

12:03.850 --> 12:06.185
No. Not exactly.

12:06.253 --> 12:10.423
I set one -- and only one --
charge in that building.

12:10.491 --> 12:13.793
My target was a man
named Larry Sizemore,

12:13.861 --> 12:16.362
a sociopathic CIA Agent.

12:16.430 --> 12:19.031
As for the other bombs,
I had nothing --

12:19.099 --> 12:20.433
- Wait, wait, wait. Slow down.
- Just listen.

12:20.500 --> 12:23.402
The man you want --
his name is Anson Fullerton.

12:23.470 --> 12:25.271
He planted all the other bombs
in that building.

12:25.338 --> 12:27.106
He framed me for it.
You have to go after him.

12:27.174 --> 12:28.608
- You need to find him --
- Whoa, whoa.

12:28.675 --> 12:29.842
I don't <i>need</i>
<i>to do anything.</i>

12:29.910 --> 12:31.210
Maybe you're not clear
how this works.

12:31.278 --> 12:33.446
You see how you're chained
to the table?

12:33.514 --> 12:35.949
That's how you know
that you're not in charge here.

12:38.218 --> 12:41.154
So, how about this?

12:41.222 --> 12:44.391
I ask and you answer.

12:45.961 --> 12:47.294
Are you even
listening to me?

12:47.362 --> 12:49.563
Anson is getting away
as we speak.

12:49.630 --> 12:50.897
How many n's in "Glenanne"?

12:53.034 --> 12:55.101
You see what you did?
Now I have to start again.

13:01.309 --> 13:03.043
You're sure Anson's
in a green Jag?

13:03.111 --> 13:04.278
That's what Jesse said.

13:04.346 --> 13:05.413
We'll find him, Mike.

13:05.481 --> 13:07.482
He had to have been
in one of these cars

13:07.549 --> 13:08.950
if he was headed
to Cutler Bay.

13:09.018 --> 13:10.284
You got to keep looking.

13:10.352 --> 13:11.686
What the hell do you think
I'm doing?

13:11.753 --> 13:13.621
Look, Mike,
I know you're pissed,

13:13.689 --> 13:15.022
but you got to know

13:15.090 --> 13:17.458
that I didn't <i>want</i> to let Fi
turn herself in.

13:17.525 --> 13:19.426
But she was right --
things were getting out of hand.

13:19.493 --> 13:21.795
You'll never convince me
that Fiona giving herself up

13:21.862 --> 13:23.396
was the right thing to do.
Never.

13:23.464 --> 13:25.064
Well, that's why
we didn't ask you.

13:25.132 --> 13:27.833
I mean, come on, Mike.
What's a guy supposed to do

13:27.901 --> 13:29.135
when he sees
his best friend

13:29.202 --> 13:30.703
heading down the path
to hell, huh?

13:30.770 --> 13:32.171
Help you pack?
Speed you on your way?

13:32.239 --> 13:33.639
I knew what I was doing!

13:33.707 --> 13:35.374
What you were doing was lying
to yourself, brother.

13:35.442 --> 13:36.342
Why can't you see that?

13:36.410 --> 13:37.210
Stop the car!

13:37.278 --> 13:38.845
You spotted Anson's wheels?

13:38.913 --> 13:40.147
I think so.

13:43.117 --> 13:45.052
Traffic here
hasn't been stopped long.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.888
He can't be far.

13:46.955 --> 13:48.689
Hey, kid, the guy
who was driving this car --

13:48.757 --> 13:50.391
you see where he went?
You know that dude?

13:50.459 --> 13:52.060
Yeah, he's, uh --
he's a friend of ours.

13:52.128 --> 13:54.563
Well, he just, like,
bailed on his ride, bro.

13:54.631 --> 13:55.530
Headed over there.

13:56.932 --> 13:59.000
Bet he's heading
to that chemical plant, Mike.

13:59.068 --> 14:00.068
Good cover
for a guy on the run.

14:00.135 --> 14:01.569
Let's check it out.

14:03.438 --> 14:06.039
- Mike, who's calling?
- I think I can guess.

14:06.107 --> 14:08.441
Anson, where the hell are you?

14:08.509 --> 14:09.742
You find my car yet?

14:09.810 --> 14:11.010
What are you
talking about?

14:11.078 --> 14:12.278
I'm at the CIA offices,

14:12.346 --> 14:13.879
sorting out the mission
you just sabotaged.

14:13.947 --> 14:14.913
Nice try, Michael.

14:14.981 --> 14:17.516
I know you, remember?

14:17.584 --> 14:19.953
A massive accident
stops traffic,

14:20.020 --> 14:23.457
a massive accident that
miraculously injures no one?

14:23.525 --> 14:26.561
You might as well have held up
a sign that says, "here I am."

14:26.628 --> 14:27.896
Anson, you are not getting away,
and I'm --

14:27.963 --> 14:28.830
Yes, yes,
you're gonna hunt me down.

14:28.898 --> 14:30.298
That's why I'm calling.

14:30.366 --> 14:32.834
I'm not sure that that
should be your first priority.

14:32.902 --> 14:34.036
Oh?
What should <i>that</i> be?

14:34.104 --> 14:35.504
Daryl Jordan.

14:35.572 --> 14:38.007
He's a former patient of mine
and an ex-army Ranger.

14:38.074 --> 14:40.376
I treated him
for paranoid schizophrenia.

14:40.443 --> 14:42.878
He needed a focus
for his violent impulses,

14:42.946 --> 14:44.279
so I suggested you.

14:44.347 --> 14:47.316
He's on his way to
947 Shady Lane right now to...

14:47.383 --> 14:49.351
address his issues.

14:49.419 --> 14:50.753
Mike, what is it?

14:50.820 --> 14:53.455
He should be at Madeline's house
in 20 minutes,

14:53.523 --> 14:55.023
so you might want to hurry.

14:55.091 --> 14:56.391
I'd hate for you to...

14:56.459 --> 14:58.827
lose Fiona and your mommy
on the same day.

15:03.183 --> 15:04.633
Pick up. Come on mom.

15:04.634 --> 15:05.744
Pick up.

15:05.745 --> 15:06.912
Mike, hang on a second.

15:06.980 --> 15:08.013
<i>You've just reached Madeline --</i>

15:08.081 --> 15:09.448
Damn it!

15:09.516 --> 15:11.150
Anson just sent a psychopath
to my mother's house, Sam.

15:11.218 --> 15:12.719
I got to get back!
Just think about it, Mike.

15:12.786 --> 15:14.087
She's all the way
across town.

15:14.154 --> 15:16.122
You just turned this highway
into a parking lot.

15:16.190 --> 15:17.424
We'll never get there
in time.

15:17.491 --> 15:18.725
I have to try!

15:18.792 --> 15:20.660
Mike, that's just what Anson
would want you to do.

15:20.728 --> 15:22.428
Now, here --
I'm gonna call Jesse.

15:22.496 --> 15:24.230
He can get to her a hell
of a lot faster than we can.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.065
Mike, we finally got
this cockroach cornered.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.001
We're not gonna get
a second chance,

15:28.068 --> 15:29.143
and you know damn well your mom
would tell you the same thing.

15:29.168 --> 15:30.003
Hello?

15:30.004 --> 15:31.704
Jesse, it's Sam.
Listen, we got a situation.

15:31.772 --> 15:33.039
What kind of situation?

15:33.107 --> 15:34.641
It's Maddy --
you got to call the cops

15:34.708 --> 15:35.975
and get over there <i>now.</i>

15:40.514 --> 15:42.482
<i>Coming up on "Miami News Live,"</i>

15:42.550 --> 15:44.984
<i>startling developments related</i>
<i>to last month's attack</i>

15:45.052 --> 15:46.252
<i>on the British consulate.</i>

15:46.320 --> 15:47.954
<i>Homeland Security officials</i>

15:48.022 --> 15:50.891
<i>announcing the arrest of an</i>
<i>Irish national earlier today.</i>

15:53.561 --> 15:55.328
<i>Her identity is being withheld,</i>

15:55.396 --> 15:57.530
<i>but she did surrender</i>
<i>to authorities</i>

15:57.598 --> 16:00.900
<i>at the downtown federal</i>
<i>building on 23rd street.</i>

16:00.968 --> 16:02.702
<i>It's believed that the suspect</i>
<i>will remain in questioning</i>

16:02.770 --> 16:04.705
<i>for the rest of the afternoon.</i>

16:04.773 --> 16:06.874
<i>No word on where</i>
<i>she'll be held after that</i>

16:06.942 --> 16:09.743
<i>or even which jurisdiction</i>
<i>will handle this case.</i>

16:09.811 --> 16:11.479
<i>Miami Metro Police,</i>

16:11.546 --> 16:13.147
<i>along with</i>
<i>the federal government,</i>

16:13.215 --> 16:16.551
<i>expanding their search on those</i>
<i>responsible for the bombing.</i>

16:16.619 --> 16:18.186
<i>A number of extremist groups</i>

16:18.254 --> 16:20.255
<i>have been flagged</i>
<i>for investigation,</i>

16:20.323 --> 16:22.257
<i>but authorities</i>
<i>have ruled them out</i>

16:22.325 --> 16:23.492
<i>as far as involvement.</i>

16:23.560 --> 16:25.360
<i>"Miami News Live" will report</i>

16:25.428 --> 16:27.597
<i>any new information</i>
<i>as it becomes available.</i>

17:28.793 --> 17:31.494
<i>Hunting for</i>
<i>a fugitive in a large area</i>

17:31.562 --> 17:33.763
<i>with a lot of cover</i>
<i>is less about skill</i>

17:33.831 --> 17:35.464
<i>than it is about manpower.</i>

17:35.532 --> 17:37.767
<i>It doesn't matter how good</i>
<i>an operative you are.</i>

17:37.835 --> 17:39.336
<i>When it comes to a manhunt,</i>

17:39.404 --> 17:41.638
<i>the more people you have</i>
<i>on your side, the better.</i>

17:41.706 --> 17:43.574
Pearce, how long before
you get backup here?

17:43.642 --> 17:45.576
Anson's in the area,
but we have to move now.

17:45.644 --> 17:47.111
Michael,
not only am I dealing

17:47.179 --> 17:48.813
with a burning plane
at the airport,

17:48.881 --> 17:51.616
I'm dealing with an operation
that went completely sideways.

17:51.684 --> 17:53.618
It'll be hours
before I can get a team to you,

17:53.686 --> 17:54.619
if I can do it at all.

17:54.687 --> 17:55.887
We don't have hours.

17:55.955 --> 17:57.855
If we lose this chance,
we may not get another.

17:57.923 --> 18:00.025
I can't just snap my fingers
and make it happen.

18:00.092 --> 18:01.326
As of this morning,

18:01.394 --> 18:03.261
no one at the CIA knew
who Anson Fullerton was.

18:03.328 --> 18:04.796
Nothing is more important
than this!

18:04.864 --> 18:07.566
Just give me some support!
Do whatever it takes!

18:07.633 --> 18:09.401
Sounds like it's just us.

18:09.469 --> 18:11.203
So, Mike, if Anson's
in that building,

18:11.271 --> 18:13.171
it could take days
to track him down.

18:13.239 --> 18:14.940
If we wait for backup,
we're gonna lose him.

18:15.008 --> 18:16.842
If he was headed to Cutler Bay
to meet a boat,

18:16.909 --> 18:18.610
chances are he's already
redirected it here.

18:18.678 --> 18:20.479
We probably don't have
more than two hours, tops.

18:31.124 --> 18:33.592
Your statement is interesting,
Ms. Glenanne.

18:33.660 --> 18:35.994
Some of it even fits
with what we know.

18:36.062 --> 18:37.630
Here's the problem.

18:37.698 --> 18:40.799
Your story is missing
a main character.

18:40.867 --> 18:42.300
What are you talking about?

18:42.368 --> 18:44.603
Well, we both know that you
didn't kill Larry Sizemore

18:44.671 --> 18:46.438
because you were
suddenly overwhelmed

18:46.506 --> 18:48.240
by the desire to
provide free security

18:48.308 --> 18:49.841
for the British consulate.

18:49.909 --> 18:53.078
You wouldn't have killed Larry
unless you had a good reason,

18:53.145 --> 18:56.614
like, say... protecting
your boyfriend, Michael Westen.

18:56.682 --> 18:57.882
I'm not
with Michael anymore.

18:57.950 --> 19:00.584
Really?

19:00.652 --> 19:01.819
I'm surprised to hear that.

19:01.887 --> 19:03.220
The two of you were
quite the couple.

19:03.288 --> 19:05.289
Not to mention the fact
that I have documented cases

19:05.357 --> 19:06.890
of you two working together
as recently as --

19:06.958 --> 19:09.826
We have a-a business
relationship -- nothing more.

19:09.893 --> 19:12.662
Look, I understand your desire
to protect him.

19:12.729 --> 19:14.897
But I'm not sure
that you understand

19:14.964 --> 19:16.699
the situation
that you're in here.

19:16.767 --> 19:20.703
You're going down for three
counts of capital murder.

19:20.770 --> 19:23.607
Now, that's a ticket
to death row.

19:23.674 --> 19:27.678
But... you tell me truth
about Michael,

19:27.745 --> 19:29.313
and it doesn't have
to be that way.

19:32.918 --> 19:35.186
Michael...

19:35.254 --> 19:37.355
had nothing to do
with this.

19:37.423 --> 19:39.257
Don't.

19:39.325 --> 19:41.159
Don't insult
my intelligence.

19:41.227 --> 19:43.195
Look, this isn't personal,
all right?

19:43.263 --> 19:46.933
I worked with Michael,
and he has his moments.

19:47.001 --> 19:49.670
I'm just here
to get the truth.

19:49.737 --> 19:53.307
Why don't you just tell me --
what's it gonna be?

19:55.544 --> 19:58.012
Fiona, trust me --
you need a friend here.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.514
I have enough friends.

19:59.582 --> 20:01.149
You have my statement.

20:20.267 --> 20:22.135
Well, he's not outside
the perimeter.

20:22.203 --> 20:23.369
Safe to say he went in?

20:23.437 --> 20:24.770
It's his best move.

20:24.838 --> 20:27.406
He'd have a place to hide
and access to the waterfront.

20:27.473 --> 20:28.840
Okay.
But how did he get in?

20:28.908 --> 20:30.342
Anson doesn't seem the type

20:30.409 --> 20:32.477
to scale a fence
topped with razor wire.

20:32.544 --> 20:33.878
Maybe he walked
through the front door.

20:33.946 --> 20:34.946
Well,
how's he gonna do that?

20:37.416 --> 20:38.449
Oh, you've got
to be kidding.

20:44.390 --> 20:45.757
Shot in the back.

20:45.825 --> 20:47.092
He's dead, Sam.

20:47.160 --> 20:48.660
He's got to be close.

20:48.728 --> 20:51.563
<i>I repeat -- shots fired</i>
<i>at the main gate.</i>

20:51.631 --> 20:52.831
<i>One man down.</i>

20:52.898 --> 20:54.666
<i>There are two suspects,</i>
<i>both armed.</i>

20:54.734 --> 20:56.401
- Mike, that voice -- is that --
- Anson.

21:01.141 --> 21:02.809
Looks like we got company.

21:04.078 --> 21:05.178
Freeze!

21:05.245 --> 21:06.646
Oh, crap.
Here they come.

21:09.317 --> 21:11.651
Well, Mike, I guess the good
news is, we found him.

21:17.896 --> 21:20.131
Anson could see us
at the gate.

21:20.199 --> 21:21.666
He's got to be
in one of those windows.

21:23.535 --> 21:25.335
We got to get in there, Sam.
Oh, yeah?

21:25.403 --> 21:27.037
How do you propose to do that
with our new friends outside?

21:27.104 --> 21:28.739
We're gonna have to
go through them.

21:28.806 --> 21:30.040
Oh, whoa, whoa!
Mike, slow down.

21:30.107 --> 21:31.441
I mean, I know you want
to nail Anson --

21:31.509 --> 21:33.142
I am not losing him, Sam!

21:34.678 --> 21:37.347
They got both exits covered,

21:37.414 --> 21:39.015
and if this is gonna be
a bloodbath, I'm out,

21:39.082 --> 21:41.250
because the guys outside
are just doing their jobs!

21:42.586 --> 21:43.953
Even if they are a little
trigger happy.

21:44.021 --> 21:45.822
That's probably our best way
out of here.

21:45.889 --> 21:47.123
What, getting shot?

21:47.191 --> 21:49.626
Something like that.

21:49.693 --> 21:53.130
Oh, Mike, no, no.
This is not a good plan.

21:53.197 --> 21:54.331
I don't like this plan.

21:54.399 --> 21:55.966
Well, get ready
to like it even less

21:56.034 --> 21:57.334
'cause I need you
to play dead.

22:00.371 --> 22:02.239
I'm hit! I'm hit!

22:02.307 --> 22:03.807
Don't shoot!
I'm coming out!

22:03.875 --> 22:06.844
Come out slowly!
Hands behind your head!

22:08.880 --> 22:10.014
Don't shoot.

22:10.081 --> 22:11.448
I need an ambulance.

22:11.516 --> 22:13.350
I said,
hands behind your head!

22:13.418 --> 22:15.419
I can't!

22:15.486 --> 22:17.321
<i>It's almost impossible</i>
<i>to escape</i>

22:17.388 --> 22:19.422
<i>when you're being handcuffed</i>
<i>by pros.</i>

22:19.490 --> 22:21.391
<i>They're trained</i>
<i>to work in pairs</i>

22:21.459 --> 22:23.393
<i>when handcuffing</i>
<i>a dangerous suspect.</i>

22:23.461 --> 22:24.694
Where's the other one?

22:24.762 --> 22:26.029
He's inside.
I think he's dead.

22:26.097 --> 22:27.564
On the ground now!

22:30.335 --> 22:31.568
You killed him.

22:31.636 --> 22:32.837
Arms out!

22:32.904 --> 22:34.538
I can't move my arm!

22:34.606 --> 22:38.075
<i>One cuffs the hostile while</i>
<i>the other covers them both.</i>

22:38.143 --> 22:39.677
<i>Even if he can avoid</i>
<i>getting cuffed,</i>

22:39.745 --> 22:41.546
<i>it only buys you a second</i>
<i>before you get shot.</i>

22:41.613 --> 22:43.715
Let him go.
I <i>will</i> shoot you.

22:43.783 --> 22:46.751
Boo. Drop the gun.

22:46.819 --> 22:48.486
Please, I got --
I got kids.

22:48.554 --> 22:49.788
And we want you
to go home to them.

22:49.856 --> 22:51.289
<i>But sometimes a second</i>
<i>is all you need.</i>

22:51.357 --> 22:54.326
Believe it or not,
we're the good guys.

22:55.962 --> 22:57.595
<i>It's Sam.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

22:57.663 --> 22:59.397
Hey, man,
I'm pulling up to Maddy's.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.099
Good news --
the cops are here,

23:01.167 --> 23:02.667
so I'll call you
with an update.

23:04.704 --> 23:06.772
Officer.

23:06.840 --> 23:09.241
Hey, you're probably here
responding to my call.

23:09.309 --> 23:10.309
Thanks for showing up
so quickly.

23:19.452 --> 23:23.889
<i>Clearing a structure</i>
<i>is ideally a team effort.</i>

23:23.957 --> 23:25.491
<i>When you're forced</i>
<i>to do it alone,</i>

23:25.559 --> 23:27.226
<i>you have to take</i>
<i>special precautions,</i>

23:27.294 --> 23:30.463
<i>like using peripheral vision</i>
<i>to check angles.</i>

23:33.099 --> 23:35.835
<i>But ultimately,</i>
<i>no matter how careful you are,</i>

23:35.903 --> 23:39.105
<i>there's always one angle you</i>
<i>can't see when you're alone --</i>

23:39.172 --> 23:40.640
<i>the one behind you.</i>

23:40.707 --> 23:42.274
Don't move.

23:44.177 --> 23:45.611
Gun down.

23:47.814 --> 23:49.114
Where is Michael Westen?

23:51.384 --> 23:53.753
You go first -- the woman who
lives here -- where is she?

23:55.522 --> 23:59.292
You have five seconds to tell me
where Michael Westen is!

23:59.360 --> 24:00.460
Okay, just hold on.
5...

24:00.528 --> 24:01.428
I can help you...
...4...

24:01.496 --> 24:02.629
...if you help me.
...3...

24:02.697 --> 24:03.597
Hold on, listen to me!
...2...

24:03.664 --> 24:04.464
Just listen to me!
...1.

24:04.532 --> 24:05.465
Hold on!

24:12.707 --> 24:14.340
Jesse, look out!

24:20.248 --> 24:21.748
Are you okay?

24:21.816 --> 24:23.884
You let him count all the way
down to 1? Seriously?

24:23.952 --> 24:25.218
Well, the more he talked,

24:25.286 --> 24:27.421
the better my chance
of shooting the right guy.

24:29.190 --> 24:31.658
I'm glad you got more than
Christmas ornaments up there.

24:31.726 --> 24:34.561
Yeah.

24:34.629 --> 24:36.029
Who is he?

24:36.097 --> 24:37.264
An errand boy.

24:37.331 --> 24:38.966
Mike and Sam
are closing in on Anson.

24:39.034 --> 24:40.801
Guess he figured
they'd call off the chase

24:40.869 --> 24:42.436
if they were worried
about saving you.

24:42.504 --> 24:45.874
What about Fiona?

24:45.941 --> 24:47.943
Is it as bad
as the news is saying?

24:48.010 --> 24:49.477
It's worse.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.328
Oh. You again.

25:07.395 --> 25:10.163
Look, no matter how many times
we do this,

25:10.231 --> 25:12.365
my story is not
going to change.

25:12.433 --> 25:14.868
I'm afraid you're wrong
about that, Ms. Glenanne.

25:14.936 --> 25:16.236
Your story
has an ending now.

25:24.245 --> 25:25.813
What is this?

25:25.880 --> 25:27.781
There was an accident.

25:27.849 --> 25:29.450
A truck spun out of control
on the highway.

25:29.518 --> 25:33.020
The gas tank was punctured,
and the fuel ignited instantly.

25:34.889 --> 25:38.892
Michael was in the cab
of that truck.

25:38.960 --> 25:40.660
And he didn't make it.

25:43.130 --> 25:45.865
You don't really expect me
to believe you.

25:45.932 --> 25:47.333
No.

25:47.401 --> 25:49.869
That's why I had
the coroner's report expedited.

25:57.377 --> 26:00.080
Look, I'm sorry.
I-I really am.

26:05.086 --> 26:07.588
I wish that you didn't have
to find out this way.

26:07.656 --> 26:09.190
But I thought
you should know

26:09.258 --> 26:11.126
before you throw your life
away for him.

26:19.568 --> 26:21.836
I'm gonna give you
a moment.

26:21.904 --> 26:25.039
And then we're gonna go through
your story again.

26:25.107 --> 26:26.974
The truth this time.

26:27.042 --> 26:28.408
Okay?

26:40.988 --> 26:43.022
All right, well,
security is regrouping,

26:43.090 --> 26:44.257
and by "regrouping,"

26:44.324 --> 26:46.626
I mean they're arming themselves
to the teeth,

26:46.694 --> 26:48.161
so we've got to move
quick.

26:48.229 --> 26:49.195
I'm Michael.
This is Sam.

26:49.263 --> 26:50.530
Now that we're all friends,

26:50.598 --> 26:52.232
I have a couple of
questions I need answered.

26:52.299 --> 26:54.968
I don't want to hurt you,
but that doesn't mean I won't.

26:56.503 --> 26:58.405
Stay... quiet.

26:58.472 --> 27:01.207
How do we get everyone
out of this facility right now?

27:01.275 --> 27:02.342
The whole place
is on lockdown

27:02.410 --> 27:04.110
because of what happened
out front.

27:04.178 --> 27:05.678
They're just waiting
on the cops to get here.

27:05.746 --> 27:07.747
Okay, okay. Shut up.
What about a toxic spill?

27:07.815 --> 27:09.315
How do we trigger
a full evacuation?

27:09.758 --> 27:11.025
An evacuation?

27:11.092 --> 27:13.827
Oh, God. What are you guys,
some kind of terrorists?

27:13.895 --> 27:15.762
Come on, it's like I said --
we're on the same team.

27:15.830 --> 27:18.432
I'm CIA.
Sam here is former S.E.A.L.

27:18.500 --> 27:20.468
Look, guys, see?

27:20.536 --> 27:22.671
All right?
There's the good-guy patch.

27:22.739 --> 27:24.406
So here's the situation --

27:24.474 --> 27:26.675
the guy that shot your friend
is loose in this building,

27:26.743 --> 27:28.878
and we got to flush him out
before he hurts anybody else.

27:32.249 --> 27:34.384
There's a switch
for the toxic-spill alarm

27:34.451 --> 27:36.052
in the plant manager's
office.

27:36.120 --> 27:38.187
Hey!
We have a winner.

27:39.390 --> 27:41.224
You're gonna take us
there now.

27:41.292 --> 27:43.927
But first you're going to get
all your friends out of the way.

27:43.995 --> 27:46.663
You need to direct them to the
farthest corner of this facility

27:46.731 --> 27:48.298
away from where
we're headed, okay?

27:50.969 --> 27:52.369
Attention all units --

27:52.437 --> 27:54.304
we've got a visual
on the shooters

27:54.372 --> 27:56.707
entering the southeast
maintenance annex.

27:56.774 --> 27:58.508
Requesting support.

27:58.576 --> 27:59.743
Very good. Let's go.

27:59.811 --> 28:00.911
Now, sit tight.

28:00.979 --> 28:02.346
Believe it or not,

28:02.413 --> 28:05.349
it's the safest you've been
since breakfast.

28:09.387 --> 28:12.289
When the alarm is triggered
on the east side of the plant...

28:12.357 --> 28:14.892
...everyone files out this door.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.695
If I can get here, I'd be able
to see everybody leave.

28:17.762 --> 28:18.929
I like the plan, Mike,

28:18.997 --> 28:19.963
but you probably
shouldn't go anywhere

28:20.031 --> 28:20.864
looking like
the walking dead.

28:23.735 --> 28:25.236
I need to borrow
your uniform.

28:25.304 --> 28:26.437
You got to be kidding me.

28:28.474 --> 28:30.041
Ooh, you see that look?

28:30.108 --> 28:31.376
That look means
he's not kidding.

28:34.013 --> 28:36.614
I'll need five minutes
to get into position.

29:08.815 --> 29:10.616
What? What?

29:10.684 --> 29:12.251
Nothing. Go.

29:12.319 --> 29:14.386
Wow, Michael.

29:14.454 --> 29:15.587
Pearce, you made it.

29:15.655 --> 29:17.489
Okay. Not sure why I expected
anything less

29:17.557 --> 29:18.891
than world war III.

29:18.958 --> 29:21.393
There were only so many options
for Sam and me.

29:21.461 --> 29:23.528
I'm sorry I didn't
get here sooner.

29:23.596 --> 29:25.464
You certainly didn't make it
easy on the highway.

29:25.531 --> 29:26.698
What's the situation?

29:26.766 --> 29:28.400
Anson Fullerton
is in the area,

29:28.467 --> 29:29.935
and he's already killed
one security guard.

29:30.002 --> 29:31.336
And the air-raid sirens?

29:31.404 --> 29:33.906
We set off the alarm
to clear the building.

29:33.973 --> 29:35.674
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
We have a contamination zone.

29:35.742 --> 29:36.976
You're gonna have
to clear the area.

29:37.043 --> 29:38.077
Dani Pearce, CIA.

29:38.145 --> 29:40.981
Who the hell are you?

29:41.048 --> 29:42.716
He one of yours?

29:42.783 --> 29:44.251
Can we have a word?
Let's just...

29:44.318 --> 29:46.320
Mike, good news --
I talked to Jesse.

29:46.388 --> 29:47.655
My mom?
She's okay.

29:47.722 --> 29:48.856
It was dicey,
but she's okay.

29:48.924 --> 29:50.592
Any sign of Anson?

29:50.659 --> 29:52.861
No, he wasn't with any of
the employees who evacuated.

29:52.928 --> 29:54.195
A lot of places
to hide, Mike.

29:54.263 --> 29:56.131
I mean, we're talking
about a needle in a haystack.

29:56.198 --> 29:57.498
What are the chances
he's even here?

29:57.566 --> 29:58.699
I don't know, Sam!

29:58.767 --> 30:00.034
But you and I
can try to clear

30:00.101 --> 30:01.335
the east side of the plant.

30:01.403 --> 30:03.537
Pearce and her team --

30:08.642 --> 30:10.142
Anson, we were just
talking about you.

30:10.210 --> 30:11.410
I'm flattered,

30:11.478 --> 30:13.512
but, really, don't you have
better things to do?

30:13.580 --> 30:15.748
Go home, spend time with
the family you have left.

30:15.816 --> 30:17.550
Yeah, a CIA team
has just arrived, Anson.

30:17.618 --> 30:18.618
You're not getting
out of this.

30:18.686 --> 30:19.686
That's good, Michael.

30:19.754 --> 30:21.021
Still thinking positively,

30:21.089 --> 30:22.390
still focused
on your goals.

30:22.457 --> 30:24.425
It's good to have a focus
for all that anger.

30:24.493 --> 30:26.327
But I'm afraid you're wrong.
Listen to me.

30:26.395 --> 30:27.729
Oh, believe me --
I'm listening.

30:27.797 --> 30:29.965
Coming after me is only
gonna cause you more pain.

30:30.033 --> 30:32.468
I know you think
I'm a monster,

30:32.536 --> 30:35.571
but the fact is,
I don't enjoy hurting you.

30:35.639 --> 30:38.241
So do us both a favor
and walk away.

30:38.308 --> 30:40.576
Tell them you lost me
and say --

30:40.644 --> 30:42.211
I'm not going anywhere,
Anson.

30:42.279 --> 30:44.747
I'm gonna hunt you down,
and I'm gonna kill you.

30:44.815 --> 30:46.949
Oh, boy.

30:47.017 --> 30:48.651
You're not gonna like
the way this ends.

30:48.719 --> 30:50.019
I'll take my chances.

30:52.156 --> 30:53.689
What was that about?
What'd he say?

30:53.757 --> 30:55.858
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter what he said.

30:55.926 --> 30:57.927
What matters is that I heard
a turbine in the background.

30:59.129 --> 31:00.597
He's still in the building!

31:01.275 --> 31:02.555
I don't see anything,
Michael.

31:02.556 --> 31:03.589
Are you sure?
I'm sure.

31:03.657 --> 31:04.323
He's somewhere
in the building.

31:04.391 --> 31:05.258
We have to keep looking.

31:07.862 --> 31:09.295
The CIA is keeping
the police clear

31:09.363 --> 31:10.563
until they know more about
who Anson was working with.

31:10.631 --> 31:11.665
We're on our own for now.

31:11.732 --> 31:13.233
Fine. I'll get him alone
if I have to.

31:14.936 --> 31:15.969
Okay. So <i>three</i> guys?

31:16.037 --> 31:17.671
Seriously?
That's all you got?

31:17.738 --> 31:20.039
To hunt a D.I.A. psychiatrist
on short notice?

31:20.107 --> 31:21.340
Yeah, Sam.

31:21.407 --> 31:23.308
I had a hard enough time
convincing them

31:23.376 --> 31:24.609
not to send a team
after Michael.

31:24.677 --> 31:26.211
You know, it's not lost on me,
by the way,

31:26.279 --> 31:28.113
that nobody bothered to tell me
about him until now.

31:28.180 --> 31:29.580
No, no, Pearce,
you got to understand --

31:29.648 --> 31:31.182
this guy had us all
over a barrel.

31:31.249 --> 31:33.117
Why do you think Fi --
There! Right there.

31:33.185 --> 31:35.085
We passed a door on the way
to the alarm room.

31:35.153 --> 31:36.721
It was open.
Now it's closed, Sam.

31:36.788 --> 31:39.190
Maybe a worker closed it
as they were being evacuated.

31:39.258 --> 31:41.827
No, he's right.
Look at the monitor next to it.

31:41.894 --> 31:44.029
It's staring at a wall.
Somebody turned that camera.

31:44.097 --> 31:46.565
I heard those mixing tanks
over the phone.

31:46.633 --> 31:48.401
- That's where he is.
- Okay. So how do we do this?

31:48.469 --> 31:50.503
I'm going after him.

31:50.571 --> 31:51.871
Mike, you can't just
barge in there.

31:51.939 --> 31:53.373
Save it, Sam.
I'm gonna end this now.

31:53.441 --> 31:54.541
You're not thinking
straight!

31:54.609 --> 31:55.909
You didn't hear him
gloating!

31:55.976 --> 31:57.510
Gloating about how
he's gonna walk away from this,

31:57.578 --> 31:59.179
how he's gonna take everything
away from me!

31:59.246 --> 32:00.780
I'm not letting
this son of a bitch --

32:00.847 --> 32:03.816
Mike, stand down!
Not this time, Sam. Not this time.

32:06.119 --> 32:07.386
Put that thing down.

32:10.089 --> 32:12.457
I can resolve this
right now, Westen.

32:12.525 --> 32:15.626
I'm not letting someone who's
pulling guns on his own team

32:15.694 --> 32:17.562
anywhere near
Anson Fullerton.

32:17.630 --> 32:21.733
You'll stand down immediately,
or you'll take it up with me.

32:21.800 --> 32:24.469
I won't let him
get away, Mike.

32:26.839 --> 32:28.240
Here.

32:37.985 --> 32:40.420
You man the surveillance
cameras.

32:40.488 --> 32:43.356
You see anything,
you radio in.

32:47.462 --> 32:48.529
Let's go.

33:11.621 --> 33:13.589
<i>An ultra-wideband</i>
<i>frequency scanner</i>

33:13.656 --> 33:15.290
<i>is one of the newer devices</i>

33:15.358 --> 33:17.960
<i>in the toolkit of</i>
<i>the tactical breaching team.</i>

33:18.028 --> 33:20.229
<i>It's portable,</i>
<i>requires little power,</i>

33:20.297 --> 33:22.497
<i>and can see through doors</i>
<i>well enough</i>

33:22.565 --> 33:24.900
<i>to tell you if they're worth</i>
<i>kicking down.</i>

33:24.968 --> 33:27.970
Hey, Anson,
we know you're in there.

33:28.037 --> 33:29.538
You know you're trapped,

33:29.605 --> 33:32.407
so you might want to do yourself
a favor and open up this door.

33:32.475 --> 33:34.276
It'll save us all
a lot of headache.

33:34.343 --> 33:36.878
He's probably waiting to take
a shot at us when we go in.

33:36.946 --> 33:38.947
Well, that's why God made
flashbang grenades.

33:39.014 --> 33:40.315
<i>Open it up.</i>

33:50.226 --> 33:52.061
<i>Under the right circumstances,</i>

33:52.128 --> 33:54.897
<i>stress can make you</i>
<i>hyperaware --</i>

33:54.965 --> 33:57.266
<i>alert to every detail.</i>

33:57.334 --> 33:59.168
<i>It can also make you paranoid</i>

33:59.235 --> 34:01.503
<i>and prone to seeing</i>
<i>what you want to see.</i>

34:09.512 --> 34:11.346
Sam, you there?

34:11.414 --> 34:13.614
Yeah, Mike,
we're cutting now.

34:13.683 --> 34:14.783
Is everything all right?

34:14.850 --> 34:16.717
I'm just gonna
check something out.

34:16.784 --> 34:18.386
What is it?

34:18.454 --> 34:19.320
It's probably nothing.

34:44.812 --> 34:46.379
Surprised to see me,
Anson?

34:46.447 --> 34:47.647
You don't want to do this,
Michael.

34:47.715 --> 34:48.882
Oh, yes, I do.

35:02.861 --> 35:03.728
Aah!

35:07.566 --> 35:08.666
Enough!

35:10.269 --> 35:11.369
Any closer
and your friends die.

35:15.007 --> 35:16.274
It's a dead-man switch.

35:16.342 --> 35:17.709
I rewired a detonator,

35:17.777 --> 35:20.145
just in case something
like this happened.

35:20.213 --> 35:22.381
Just in case you found me.

35:22.449 --> 35:25.518
The whole building is loaded
with explosives, Michael.

35:25.586 --> 35:27.753
Not to mention the chemicals
in the tanks.

35:27.821 --> 35:28.988
If I drop this --

35:29.056 --> 35:30.790
if I stop applying
the 12.5 pounds pressure

35:30.858 --> 35:32.158
required by the trigger --

35:34.061 --> 35:35.428
you'll be scraping Sam

35:35.496 --> 35:38.097
and that pet CIA agent of yours
off the walls.

35:38.165 --> 35:39.599
You hurt my friends,
you die.

35:39.667 --> 35:42.001
You have a choice,
Michael.

35:42.069 --> 35:44.603
Capture me
or save your friends.

35:46.439 --> 35:47.406
Back up!!

35:52.645 --> 35:53.912
Part of growing up
is learning

35:53.979 --> 35:55.747
you can't have everything
you want in life, Michael.

35:58.618 --> 36:00.719
That'd be my ride.

36:02.522 --> 36:03.723
So, what's it gonna be?

36:05.893 --> 36:06.759
I thought so.

36:14.903 --> 36:16.336
Sam, get out
of the building.

36:16.404 --> 36:17.804
Mike, what are you
talking about?

36:17.872 --> 36:18.905
We're almost through!

36:18.973 --> 36:20.675
I just found Anson!

36:20.742 --> 36:22.109
He's wired the building
to explode!

36:22.177 --> 36:23.911
Get out now!
It's a trap.

36:23.978 --> 36:24.778
Then who the hell
is in there?

36:24.846 --> 36:26.313
Guys, help me knock it down!

36:32.688 --> 36:34.989
Oh, damn it.
Pearce, get out of here. Go!

36:35.056 --> 36:36.156
Let's go, let's go!

36:41.896 --> 36:43.096
Back up, pal.

37:14.694 --> 37:15.594
Sam.

37:22.194 --> 37:23.028
Sam.

37:31.705 --> 37:33.840
Sam.

37:38.345 --> 37:40.613
Sam!

37:47.920 --> 37:49.020
Sa--

38:33.731 --> 38:35.532
Hey, Ma. How you doing?

38:35.563 --> 38:37.464
I'm fine, Michael.

38:37.532 --> 38:39.032
Uh, the police are here.

38:39.100 --> 38:40.734
Jesse told me
what happened.

38:40.802 --> 38:42.736
I never shot anyone before.

38:42.804 --> 38:45.072
I'm sorry, Ma.
I'm really sorry.

38:46.841 --> 38:48.275
And you --
are you okay?

38:48.342 --> 38:49.242
Yeah.

38:49.310 --> 38:51.211
What about Fiona?

38:51.279 --> 38:52.779
She's gone.

38:58.387 --> 38:59.820
I got to go.

38:59.888 --> 39:02.324
Ma, I love you.

39:02.391 --> 39:04.292
I love you, too, Michael.

39:06.663 --> 39:09.532
You wanted the CIA
to go after Anson.

39:09.600 --> 39:12.535
Well, he just hit the top
of their "most wanted" list.

39:12.603 --> 39:15.638
Good. Now tell them that
he framed Fi and get her out.

39:15.706 --> 39:17.039
Michael,
it's not that simple.

39:17.107 --> 39:19.642
No, it is
exactly that simple.

39:19.710 --> 39:21.010
Right now,
all we can prove

39:21.078 --> 39:22.545
is that Anson tried to blow up
my extraction team.

39:22.612 --> 39:23.612
Does it help her case?
Yes.

39:23.680 --> 39:24.813
Is it enough? No.

39:24.881 --> 39:27.349
What if I caught him?
Would that be enough?

39:27.417 --> 39:29.317
It's...

39:32.220 --> 39:33.587
...a start.

39:35.423 --> 39:38.058
Well, a start's a start.

39:38.126 --> 39:39.960
Sam, I'm sorry.

39:40.028 --> 39:42.430
I'm sorry, too, Mike.

39:44.467 --> 39:45.567
Come on, let's go.

39:45.634 --> 39:47.936
We got work to do.

39:56.278 --> 39:58.913
So, this outlines the basics
of Michael's involvement.

39:58.981 --> 40:00.748
You can fill in
the details later.

40:00.816 --> 40:03.785
For now,
I just need your signature.

40:08.023 --> 40:10.257
I want to see
the photos again.

40:10.325 --> 40:13.461
Why do you want to torture
yourself like that?

40:13.528 --> 40:15.629
They were
his last moments.

40:15.697 --> 40:18.266
Please.

40:30.246 --> 40:34.216
Michael lived a dangerous life,
and it ended in tragedy.

40:34.284 --> 40:36.551
But now you have a chance
to live yours.

40:47.062 --> 40:48.863
You said that the, um...

40:48.930 --> 40:51.565
the fuel tank
was punctured?

40:51.632 --> 40:52.933
Yes, it ignited, and...

40:53.000 --> 40:54.167
that was it.

40:54.235 --> 40:55.335
He never had a chance.

40:56.937 --> 40:58.772
No.

40:58.840 --> 41:00.641
No, the sides of the --

41:00.709 --> 41:04.079
the cab would have been
blasted off...

41:04.147 --> 41:06.815
in a pressurized
explosion.

41:08.719 --> 41:10.553
The, uh...

41:10.621 --> 41:13.891
the doors are still
on their hinges.

41:13.958 --> 41:16.461
This wasn't an accident.

41:16.528 --> 41:18.262
Looks more like
a roadblock.

41:20.566 --> 41:22.633
You're a liar.

41:24.203 --> 41:25.537
Michael's alive.

41:27.874 --> 41:31.009
How could you possibly know that
from looking at a photo?

41:31.077 --> 41:33.312
I know explosions.

41:33.380 --> 41:35.981
I know Michael.

41:36.049 --> 41:38.183
And I know
that we're done here.

41:53.568 --> 41:55.803
I hope that this
"business relationship"

41:55.870 --> 41:58.105
that you have with Michael
is worth it.

41:58.587 --> 42:02.956
Because from the way it looks,
you're gonna die for him.
