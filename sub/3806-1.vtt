00:39.806 --> 00:42.808
   >> Why are you frightened,
             child?

00:42.810 --> 00:45.677
>> I'm disturbed by my visions,
           Guru Dev.

00:47.747 --> 00:52.317
    I see strange figures...
           in white.

00:52.319 --> 00:56.655
     In some strange place
         full of light.

00:56.657 --> 01:02.995
I see a man in some other place
      in a blood red coat.

01:02.997 --> 01:07.032
        <i> And I see a ring</i>
         <i> which shimmers</i>
        <i> in a blue light.</i>

01:10.837 --> 01:14.273
>> You wish to know the meaning
   of these visions, child..

01:14.275 --> 01:18.243
       ...come what may?

01:18.245 --> 01:21.413
    There was a ring, child.
           Long ago.

01:21.415 --> 01:24.483
         <i> It was forged</i>
        <i> of eternal love.</i>

01:24.485 --> 01:27.686
  <i> One ring made of two rings.</i>

01:27.688 --> 01:31.123
  <i> To fit together, both halves</i>
         <i> had to be pure</i>

01:31.125 --> 01:33.625
  <i> at the first moment of love.</i>

01:35.161 --> 01:40.032
        <i> After much toil,</i>
  <i> a match was finally created.</i>

01:40.034 --> 01:42.534
   <i> The two halves combined..</i>

01:42.536 --> 01:45.003
  <i> ...and formed a single ring.</i>

01:45.005 --> 01:47.906
 <i> It is said, that once united..</i>

01:47.908 --> 01:51.743
      <i> ...even if separated</i>
    <i> by an ocean or an age..</i>

01:51.745 --> 01:55.047
  <i> ...they will always reunite.</i>

01:55.049 --> 01:58.984
 <i> They are called, "The Lovers."</i>

02:06.292 --> 02:08.594
         >> Okay, baby,
    you're at quarter deck..

02:08.596 --> 02:10.429
      ...alpha grid north.

02:10.431 --> 02:11.563
        Can you check..

02:11.565 --> 02:14.466
     ...grid alpha 5 beta?

02:14.468 --> 02:17.202
    >> Yeah. Unfortunately,
   I don't think I'm gonna be

02:17.204 --> 02:21.173
          able to get
     underneath this beam.

02:21.175 --> 02:23.108
         There's really
   no way around it, either.

02:23.110 --> 02:26.211
  I think we're gonna have to
 leave this one for next time.

02:26.213 --> 02:28.046
       Sorry, sweetheart.

02:28.048 --> 02:31.316
 >> Allie, take a look at this.
       No, Jay, pan back.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.885
     <i> Can we get any closer?</i>

02:32.887 --> 02:36.288
            >> Okay.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.456
           I see it.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.690
 I'm gonna send the little guy
            in there

02:38.692 --> 02:41.894
    because I can't get in.
      It's a little tight.

02:47.734 --> 02:50.135
      >> Can -- can I have
        high resolution?

02:58.144 --> 03:02.614
 We're the first people to see
       this in 300 years.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.416
              Wow.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.954
      <i> God, it's beautiful.</i>

03:08.956 --> 03:11.023
       >> Since the Naiad
      sailed from Bombay.

03:11.025 --> 03:14.159
   I want to say it's Indian,
 but I can't put a date on it.

03:14.161 --> 03:17.563
       This snake design,
     I think it's ancient.

03:17.565 --> 03:21.333
  It could be part of a pair.

03:21.335 --> 03:24.403
 Anyway, it was very important
   to somebody on our wreck.

03:24.405 --> 03:25.671
           >> How so?

03:25.673 --> 03:29.841
    >> You see, the kind of
    silver purse type thing?

03:29.843 --> 03:32.110
 Bears the initials D.E. on it.

03:32.112 --> 03:36.815
   Whoever D.E. was...drowned
    clinging to that purse.

04:33.172 --> 04:37.643
  >> Look in yourself, Tulaja.
       It will be, thus.

04:39.145 --> 04:42.948
  <i> You will love with the full</i>
   <i> force of a woman's heart.</i>

04:42.950 --> 04:46.618
         <i> And your love</i>
   <i> will be returned in full.</i>

04:46.620 --> 04:49.221
 <i> But you will betray your love</i>

04:49.223 --> 04:53.191
   <i> and as you have foreseen,</i>
          <i> he will die.</i>

04:58.564 --> 05:01.833
>> <i> Guru Dev, am I such a person,</i>
           <i> Guru Dev?</i>

05:01.835 --> 05:05.904
>> What beats within your chest,
            Tulaja?

05:05.906 --> 05:07.806
     >> My heart, Guru Dev.

05:07.808 --> 05:11.543
 >> Where else in the universe
      is betrayal, Tulaja?

05:11.545 --> 05:13.345
   If not in the human heart.

05:13.347 --> 05:14.846
     >> I will not betray.

05:14.848 --> 05:17.449
I swear not to do so, Guru Dev.

05:17.451 --> 05:18.950
       I will not betray.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.486
>> Your path is already chosen.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.689
    >> Then I will not love.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.632
           >> Allie?

05:33.634 --> 05:35.300
           >> <i> Laura!</i>

05:35.302 --> 05:36.601
           >> <i> Allie!</i>

05:36.603 --> 05:37.903
    >> <i> Hang in there, Laura.</i>

05:37.905 --> 05:39.338
        >> <i> Where's Jay?</i>

05:39.340 --> 05:41.540
       Oh, God, help me.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.677
    >> What the hell was she
    doing down there, Allie?

05:45.679 --> 05:47.512
           >> <i> Laura?</i>
    <i> >></i> I can't move it, Jay.

05:47.514 --> 05:48.747
     <i> I can't move the beam.</i>

05:48.749 --> 05:49.948
       >> I'm coming down
    to get you, sweetheart.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.084
        <i> Just stay calm.</i>

05:52.086 --> 05:54.086
     >> I'm so sorry, Jay.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.223
    >> Matt, there's no air
        in any of these.

05:58.225 --> 05:59.991
    >> I told you, we packed
   the gear away last night.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.026
     >> I told her not to.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.461
         >> How much O2
      does she have left?

06:02.463 --> 06:05.163
        >> Ten minutes.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.132
        I'm sorry, Jay.

06:09.335 --> 06:10.802
            >> Jay.
       >> Get a RIB out.

06:10.804 --> 06:14.506
>> I've radioed the coastguard.
    >> Matt, give me a line.

06:19.345 --> 06:23.582
     >> Allie...be honest.
   How much time have I got?

06:23.584 --> 06:26.184
  >> <i> Jay! One idiot is enough.</i>

06:26.186 --> 06:27.185
              Jay!

06:43.803 --> 06:45.871
        >> <i> Laura! Laura!</i>

06:45.873 --> 06:47.072
           <i> >></i> Allie?

06:47.074 --> 06:48.173
       >> <i> We're gonna get</i>
       <i> you out of there.</i>

06:48.175 --> 06:50.108
            >> How?
    >> <i> Hang in there, Laura.</i>

06:50.110 --> 06:53.278
   >> How, Allie? How are you
     gonna do that, Allie?

06:53.280 --> 06:55.514
   >> Paul, here, take this.

06:55.516 --> 06:58.083
    >> How long to free dive
        350 feet? Matt!

06:58.085 --> 07:00.252
        >> I don't know.
 The world record's 3 minutes.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.254
   Get that RIB in the water.

07:10.563 --> 07:11.563
 >> I should have stopped her.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.098
    >> Yeah, so why the hell
        was she diving?

07:13.100 --> 07:15.000
         >> She wanted
     to bring the purse up.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.134
           >> It was
    an anniversary surprise.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.135
           >> Really?

07:38.491 --> 07:40.492
     >> What are you doing?

07:45.398 --> 07:47.365
       >> <i> Keep it coming.</i>

07:47.367 --> 07:50.101
 >> Laura, it's gonna be okay.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.103
>> It is not. He is free diving.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.822
        Guys, winch up.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.150
          Oh, my God.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.586
    Allie, he's passed out.

08:41.587 --> 08:45.624
   >> Where's the coastguard?
     >> They're on the way!

08:45.626 --> 08:47.859
 >> I got him. We're coming up.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.228
         >> ...come on.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.013
       >> <i> ...come on up.</i>

09:26.666 --> 09:29.367
       >>...16,17 18, 19,
        20, 21, 22, 23.

09:29.369 --> 09:33.138
          >> Oh, God!
 >> 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.273
            >> 1, 2.
   >> Is he okay? Is he okay?

09:35.275 --> 09:36.408
          Baby, baby.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.543
          >> 1, 2, 3.
   >> Oh, honey. Is he okay?

09:38.545 --> 09:40.745
            >> 5, 6.
       >> Get the defib!

09:40.747 --> 09:42.113
         >> <i> Annie, go!</i>

09:43.917 --> 09:47.953
       >> Oh, shit. Shit.
   >> <i> Okay, okay, okay, okay.</i>

09:47.955 --> 09:52.023
      >> Oh, God. Oh, God.
I thought I'd lost you. Oh, God.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.959
     >> <i> Put your head back.</i>
     >> You are okay, baby?

09:55.395 --> 09:58.830
 >> <i> Jay? Keep your head still.</i>
     <i> Keep your head still.</i>

10:03.235 --> 10:08.006
         >> It's okay.
   Don't ever do that again.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.809
     >> I'm fine. I'm fine.

10:15.548 --> 10:16.715
        >> Jay, you've..
          Oh, my God.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.783
      >> Oh, God! Oh, God!
     Jay, are you alright?

10:18.785 --> 10:19.784
            >> Jay!
     >> <i> Has he got a pulse?</i>

10:19.786 --> 10:21.953
   >> He's still got a pulse.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.588
       >> He's breathing.
         >> <i> Here. Here.</i>

10:23.590 --> 10:24.823
       >> <i> Jesus, where's</i>
        <i> the flashlight?</i>

10:24.825 --> 10:26.091
    <i> This is fucking serious.</i>

10:26.093 --> 10:27.425
            >> <i> Jay!</i>
   >> <i> Get the defibrillator!</i>

10:27.427 --> 10:29.594
     >> <i> Jay, come on. Jay.</i>
    >> <i> Jay, can you hear us?</i>

10:29.596 --> 10:31.029
>> <i> It's coming. They're coming!</i>

10:31.031 --> 10:34.799
     >> <i> Jay, where are you?</i>
  <i> Can you hear us, Jay? Baby?</i>

10:34.801 --> 10:36.801
            >> <i> Jay!</i>
            >> <i> Baby?</i>

10:58.624 --> 10:59.624
           >> James.

11:01.127 --> 11:02.527
             James?

11:02.529 --> 11:04.462
        James. Brother?

11:06.332 --> 11:09.267
        <i> It's 4 o'clock.</i>

11:10.503 --> 11:14.039
>> Sorry, I must have dozed off.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.908
           4 o'clock?

11:16.910 --> 11:17.909
              Aye.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.210
             Desai.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.379
          >> <i> Ji, saheb</i>
         <i> >> Mera</i> coat.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.447
          >> <i> Ji,</i> sir.

11:22.449 --> 11:25.417
        >> We'll be late
      for Governor Hornby.

11:25.419 --> 11:29.921
>> Ah, Hindu Stewart, don't they
  teach you the purpose of --

11:29.923 --> 11:32.190
     >> Clocks in Scotland?

11:48.207 --> 11:51.710
    God, I hate this place.
It's too hot. It's too crowded.

11:51.712 --> 11:52.777
  And it's too far from Scot--

11:52.779 --> 11:55.513
   >> Massachusetts, Charlie.
           The farm.

11:55.515 --> 11:58.750
  >> I know. But 4 more years
         of this? God!

11:58.752 --> 12:01.486
      >> The money we need
    can't be saved in a day.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.021
>> James, the governor's meeting

12:03.023 --> 12:05.390
        are you planning
     on speaking your mind?

12:05.392 --> 12:06.791
  >> Why do you ask, Charlie?

12:06.793 --> 12:08.460
  >> Well, I've only just got
  back from a month up country

12:08.462 --> 12:10.862
  building roads and I'd like
    to stay here for a bit.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.363
  >> I thought it was too hot
        and too crowded.

12:12.365 --> 12:13.832
           >> It is,
     but it's still better

12:13.834 --> 12:16.101
           than being
   up country building roads.

12:16.103 --> 12:19.971
         >> Gentlemen.
 His Excellency, the governor.

12:19.973 --> 12:20.972
          >> Governor.

12:20.974 --> 12:24.843
      >> Colonel Egerton,
        gentlemen, sit.

12:24.845 --> 12:28.346
      This summer of 1778

12:28.348 --> 12:30.882
 is our summer of opportunity.

12:33.185 --> 12:35.720
       Ah, Hindu Stewart!

12:35.722 --> 12:39.090
Don't they teach you the purpose
     of clocks in Scotland?

12:39.092 --> 12:41.559
          >> Governor.

12:41.561 --> 12:46.064
 >> As I was saying, we English
   hold 3 colonies in India.

12:46.066 --> 12:49.100
       But unfortunately
      on opposite coasts.

12:49.102 --> 12:54.105
      <i> We, here in Bombay,</i>
       <i> Madras down there,</i>
      <i> and Calcutta, here.</i>

12:56.142 --> 12:59.978
       Gentlemen, imagine
   if we could link them up.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.847
       We could dominate
   the entire subcontinent..

13:02.849 --> 13:05.817
     ...to the exclusion of
 all other trading companies--

13:05.819 --> 13:07.552
 >> And obtain personal riches

13:07.554 --> 13:09.187
        beyond our most
      radical imaginings.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.955
       >> Indeed. Indeed.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.858
      >> The most powerful
  obstacle to our ambitions..

13:13.860 --> 13:16.127
  ...are these kingdoms here.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.797
     Bijapur and Purandhar.

13:18.799 --> 13:22.066
      >> The present king
  is our implacable opponent.

13:22.068 --> 13:23.668
          >> However..

13:23.670 --> 13:26.504
 <i> ...an opportunity has arisen.</i>

13:26.506 --> 13:29.507
 <i> An opportunity that will allow</i>
        <i> our shareholders</i>

13:29.509 --> 13:31.910
   <i> in the East India Company</i>
           <i> to look at</i>

13:31.912 --> 13:34.846
   a map of this subcontinent
           and say --

13:34.848 --> 13:36.181
            >> Mine.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.752
       >> Captain Stewart
     hardly seems welcoming

13:40.754 --> 13:44.122
      to this opportunity.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.092
             James?

13:48.094 --> 13:52.330
  >> It is quite clear to me,
   sir, and to you, governor

13:52.332 --> 13:55.099
and to many others in this room
         that building

13:55.101 --> 13:57.168
       an empire in India
       is not the policy

13:57.170 --> 13:58.970
  of His Majesty's government
           in London.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.772
        >> A fine point.

14:00.774 --> 14:03.975
 >> London is a long way away,
        Captain Stewart.

14:03.977 --> 14:07.745
   Getting a reply from them
       can take a year..

14:07.747 --> 14:10.148
        ...as you know.

14:10.150 --> 14:13.785
  Far better to present London
      with a <i> fait accompli</i>

14:13.787 --> 14:16.788
      than wait passively
      for their approval.

14:16.790 --> 14:20.124
      >> Far wiser to wait
than to stir up a hornet's nest

14:20.126 --> 14:23.895
       without the means
to contain it, Colonel Egerton.

14:23.897 --> 14:27.131
 >> Gentlemen, the die is cast.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.300
In a month it will not serve us

14:29.302 --> 14:33.338
      to debate, but seize
  the day and seize the place.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.472
         >> Hear, hear.

15:29.695 --> 15:31.629
          >> Tulaja..

15:31.631 --> 15:34.966
   ...a little pigeon told me
      you can prophesize.

15:34.968 --> 15:37.268
     >> Highness, I can't.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.672
  >> Tulaja, you are no longer
     just guarding a queen.

15:40.674 --> 15:44.575
 You're also guarding a prince
         or a princess.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.177
          >> Highness.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.679
   >> Please tell me, Tulaja.

15:47.681 --> 15:50.515
     What future do you see
         for my child?

15:50.517 --> 15:54.652
  >> Highness, these visions,
     they just come to me.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.287
  I cannot call them at will.

15:56.289 --> 15:59.123
    >> Oh, come on, tell me
something. No matter how small.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.358
   <i> Tell me, tell me, tell me.</i>

16:00.360 --> 16:02.927
     >> Highness, I can't.
        I really can't.

16:05.331 --> 16:08.733
   >> Well, this is for you,
         my dear guard.

16:08.735 --> 16:12.570
  Please forgive my silliness.

16:12.572 --> 16:15.974
          <i> It's magic,</i>
    <i> so my grandmother said.</i>

16:15.976 --> 16:18.076
      <i> Anyway, it's ancient</i>
         <i> and precious.</i>

16:18.078 --> 16:20.345
   <i> Even though it is flawed.</i>

16:20.347 --> 16:21.846
   <i> And you know what they say</i>

16:21.848 --> 16:23.715
            <i> they say</i>
   <i> it brings lovers together</i>

16:23.717 --> 16:25.917
    <i> and keeps them together.</i>

16:25.919 --> 16:27.819
        Do you like it?

16:27.821 --> 16:33.358
      Tulaja, if you ever
    have the chance of love

16:33.360 --> 16:35.259
            <i> grab it.</i>

16:35.261 --> 16:37.195
     <i> And you will be richer</i>

16:37.197 --> 16:39.397
      <i> than I will ever be.</i>

16:47.272 --> 16:49.240
      >> We are betrayed.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.542
       The king's brother
   is a traitor. It's a coup.

16:51.544 --> 16:54.312
       Go, warn the king!
       Go, warn the king!

16:55.915 --> 16:57.849
        >> Gauri, Gauri,
      the queen in danger!

16:57.851 --> 16:59.851
        Shut the doors!
       Protect the queen.

17:03.055 --> 17:07.125
Katamaji, the king's in danger.
         Get the guard.

17:12.330 --> 17:13.431
           >> Tulaja.

17:15.134 --> 17:16.701
              Aah!

17:28.012 --> 17:29.013
             Aargh!

17:29.982 --> 17:30.982
              Unh!

17:51.303 --> 17:52.303
              Unh!

18:11.356 --> 18:12.356
             Yaah!

18:29.809 --> 18:33.211
  >> Why? You have everything
         that you need.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.545
       >> Not everything.

18:35.747 --> 18:37.081
           Not yet..

18:37.083 --> 18:39.283
        ...Your Majesty.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.652
 >> On your knees, you jackals!

18:41.654 --> 18:44.555
    You are in the presence
         of your lord.

18:44.557 --> 18:47.158
      >> You old buffoon.
    Have you lost your mind?

18:58.337 --> 19:01.672
      >> <i> Shrimant,</i> please,
           I beg you.

19:02.941 --> 19:04.108
           Spare me.

19:04.110 --> 19:05.843
      >> Sadly, Munajee..

19:07.713 --> 19:10.248
       ...life is brutal.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.917
           I'm sorry.

19:15.220 --> 19:16.621
             Salim.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.570
        >> Get him, go.
         >> Go, Pawan.

19:41.980 --> 19:43.347
     >> I'll have to break
     the arrow off, Tulaja.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.283
      Just be brave, okay?
           Be brave.

19:58.997 --> 20:01.365
       >> Sonubai? Sona.

20:02.301 --> 20:03.834
             Wife!

20:03.836 --> 20:05.536
             Sona..

20:05.538 --> 20:06.704
             Sonu?

20:09.041 --> 20:11.642
What you had asked for is done..

20:12.679 --> 20:13.844
          ...my queen.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.279
         >> It is done?

20:16.081 --> 20:17.215
            >> Yes.

20:21.653 --> 20:23.654
     >> My king, I'm queen.

20:34.566 --> 20:35.666
           >> Udaji.
           >> Father.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.001
       >> What happened?
    >> The king is deposed.

20:38.137 --> 20:39.670
         >> He's dead.
   >> Who killed him? Raoji?

20:39.672 --> 20:40.738
         <i> >> Yes. Raoji.</i>

20:41.975 --> 20:44.208
       >> I must go back.
         >> Get her in.

20:44.210 --> 20:46.611
       >> I must go back
         to the queen.

20:51.283 --> 20:53.951
        >> James. James.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.286
          >> Charlie.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.925
>> That's from Governor Hornby.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.260
          >> Oh, aye.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.270
       >> Colonel Egerton
      has seized the day.

21:15.073 --> 21:17.675
      There's been a coup
         in Purandhar.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.877
          >> The king?

21:19.879 --> 21:21.045
        >> Assassinated.

21:24.349 --> 21:27.251
    >> We have to get there
          post-haste.

21:27.253 --> 21:29.153
  <i> >> "Upon completion of this</i>
   <i> mission, you shall receive</i>

21:29.155 --> 21:32.490

21:32.492 --> 21:35.359
Well, Massachusetts
         here we come!

21:35.361 --> 21:36.861
           >> Maybe.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.129
           >> Joost!
            >> <i> Sir!</i>

21:39.531 --> 21:41.365
  >> Have the men strike camp.

21:41.367 --> 21:43.367
         <i> >> Right, sir.</i>
  >> Desai, we leave at once.

21:53.679 --> 21:56.280
  >> Well, your father will be
      pleased that we have

21:56.282 --> 21:59.250
  Captain Stewart to escort us
          to Pahadpur.

22:01.053 --> 22:03.187
  >> Does Captain Stewart know
    you're in love with him?

22:03.189 --> 22:04.722
       >> Dolly, enough!

22:04.724 --> 22:06.123
            Enough!

22:10.262 --> 22:12.129
   <i> >> Tulaja, it's too soon.</i>

22:12.131 --> 22:13.864
  >> Udaji, I need to do this.

22:13.866 --> 22:16.467
 >> Yes, but you haven't fully
 recovered yet, Tulaja. Please.

22:16.469 --> 22:19.704
>> We need a spy at the palace.
     You said so yourself.

22:20.940 --> 22:23.741
    >> Let me come with you.

22:23.743 --> 22:26.644
     >> Stay here and help
      your father, Udaji.

22:26.646 --> 22:29.914
       That is your duty
      and I must do mine.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.250
      Goodbye, my friend.

22:43.095 --> 22:45.730
  <i> >> In every breath of wind,</i>
         <i> there's a word</i>

22:45.732 --> 22:48.232
    <i> and that word is shame.</i>

22:48.234 --> 22:50.835
  <i> I can hear it in the rustle</i>
         <i> of every leaf.</i>

22:50.837 --> 22:53.104
          <i> Can you live</i>
  <i> under the rule of a coward?</i>

22:53.106 --> 22:54.572
>> No!

22:56.108 --> 22:58.275
       <i> >> Because we will</i>
         <i> all be cowards</i>

22:58.277 --> 23:00.444
      if we fail to avenge
    the murder of our king!

23:06.985 --> 23:10.521
    >> 20 years I served as
 chief minister to his father.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.225
       I, Mudhoji Kiledar

23:14.227 --> 23:16.961
will destroy the usurper Raoji,
          I swear it!

23:31.643 --> 23:33.511
    <i> >> The palace is called</i>
          <i> the Rajwada.</i>

23:33.513 --> 23:34.979
     <i> Magnificent, isn't it?</i>

23:34.981 --> 23:37.114
        >> Is that where
      we're going to stay?

23:38.250 --> 23:40.117
  Does the king have a <i> harem?</i>

23:40.119 --> 23:42.686
  >> I don't think so, Dolly.

23:42.688 --> 23:44.221
 But doubtless she'll ask him.

23:59.037 --> 24:00.538
          >> <i> My Lord..</i>

24:04.409 --> 24:07.578
  ...I know you fear that your
   enemies will rally around

24:07.580 --> 24:09.647
     the dead king's heir.

24:11.917 --> 24:13.717
   Why don't you let me give

24:13.719 --> 24:16.720
    you an heir of your own.
   They can rally around him?

24:18.257 --> 24:20.257
    We must kill the queen.

24:22.027 --> 24:23.394
       Now, you're king..

24:24.529 --> 24:26.630
  ...next, you'll be emperor.

25:11.543 --> 25:13.410
            >> Psst!

25:13.412 --> 25:16.647
           >> Queen.
  >> What are you doing here?

25:16.649 --> 25:17.648
           Highness.

25:19.251 --> 25:21.252
    >> Not so high anymore.

25:21.853 --> 25:23.354
        You're wounded.

25:25.590 --> 25:28.559
   >> No, Highness, I'm fine.

25:28.561 --> 25:30.561
    >> They mean to kill me.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.330
         >> They can't.

25:33.332 --> 25:35.566
 No one can do anything to you.

25:35.568 --> 25:37.501
  No one's going to hurt you.

25:37.503 --> 25:39.670
      >> They mustn't know
         I'm pregnant.

25:40.805 --> 25:41.972
    I swore to them I'm not.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.508
           >> Go! Go!

25:50.448 --> 25:53.350
    >> It is usual to stand
      when a queen enters.

25:53.352 --> 25:56.387
    >> When a queen enters,
         I will stand.

25:56.389 --> 25:59.657
   >> I've brought peach oil
        for your hair..

26:01.192 --> 26:03.193
   ...after we've washed it.

26:04.195 --> 26:07.932
      Just like old times.

26:11.136 --> 26:13.137
    Have you put weight on?

26:14.172 --> 26:16.073
          I think so.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.850
    My husband says we must
    take great care of you.

26:26.852 --> 26:28.252
      >> He's a king now.

26:28.254 --> 26:31.855
  And a king's disapproval is
worse than a husband's disapp..

26:31.857 --> 26:34.158
My husband thinks he's a lion.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.360
       But like most cats

26:36.362 --> 26:38.829
        if I stroke him
       in the right way..

26:40.398 --> 26:42.399
     ...he just rolls over.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.269
       He won't save you.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.438
         Not for long.

26:56.581 --> 26:59.316
        >> Your Majesty,
     this is a great honor.

26:59.318 --> 27:00.517
            >> Yes.

27:00.519 --> 27:02.353
       >> Your Majesty..

27:02.355 --> 27:07.891
    >> Her Majesty, my wife,
 wants ex-queen Jamnabai dead.

27:07.893 --> 27:10.427
 You know what women are like.

27:10.429 --> 27:12.997
    And I do see some merit
          in the idea.

27:16.968 --> 27:21.105
   >> His Majesty, my king..

27:21.107 --> 27:23.107
      ...wishes her alive.

27:25.577 --> 27:27.978
     >> She's with a child.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.580
   A rival heir to my throne

27:29.582 --> 27:32.016
   is a cause for my enemies
         to fight for.

27:32.018 --> 27:34.818
  >> With our king's support,
  you outnumber your enemies.

27:36.988 --> 27:40.391
    If Queen Jamnabai dies,
   you forfeit that support.

27:40.393 --> 27:41.725
   >> That is a matter for --

27:41.727 --> 27:45.829
     >> With respect, it is
 our king's strict stipulation.

27:52.237 --> 27:55.305
    I'm to escort the queen
      to Bombay forthwith.

28:04.649 --> 28:05.983
          >> Take her.

28:05.985 --> 28:07.317
        >> Your Majesty.

28:09.554 --> 28:10.954
             >> I..

28:14.359 --> 28:16.627
      >> The palace gates
     will be left unlocked.

28:16.629 --> 28:19.296
 You must leave within 3 hours.

28:19.298 --> 28:20.931
           Good luck.

28:28.940 --> 28:31.175
          >> Highness.
        >> Did you hear?

28:31.177 --> 28:32.976
     >> Bombay's far away.

28:32.978 --> 28:36.380
  We have a chance of getting
 rescued before we reach there.

28:36.382 --> 28:39.249
        >> Are you sure?
       >> Yes, Highness.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.784
         I have a plan.

28:40.786 --> 28:42.820
     If you will permit me
          to explain.

28:49.094 --> 28:51.829
   >> This is damnable, sire.

28:51.831 --> 28:54.465
  Did you advise the governor
   of this change of course?

28:54.467 --> 28:56.366
     >> I did not, colonel.

28:56.368 --> 28:57.868
  >> The change of ruler here

28:57.870 --> 29:00.437
      is in the company's
    best interest, captain.

29:00.439 --> 29:02.339
       Shit, sir, it took
      3 years of planning.

29:02.341 --> 29:05.309
   >> I'm England's servant,
  colonel, not the company's.

29:05.311 --> 29:07.811
           As are you
    in the final analysis..

29:07.813 --> 29:09.780
    ...unless I'm mistaken.

29:10.782 --> 29:13.450
       >> Well, captain..

29:13.452 --> 29:15.719
        ...I charge you
 with the safety of my daughter

29:15.721 --> 29:18.255
     and of her governess.

29:18.257 --> 29:21.024
If anything should befall them,
     I shall come for you.

29:23.862 --> 29:26.063
        Hindu Stewart..

29:26.065 --> 29:28.065
    ...I shall come for you.

29:38.543 --> 29:40.644
         >> Don't push!
       You'll get seen --

29:40.646 --> 29:42.613
     >> I can't see why we
 can't just take the carriage.

29:42.615 --> 29:45.716
  >> Because your father needs
        a carriage here.

29:45.718 --> 29:48.218
     >> But this is a box.
     >> This is not a box.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.921
   <i> This is a royal carriage.</i>
     <i> Queens travel in this.</i>

29:50.923 --> 29:51.922
          >> Highness.

29:59.430 --> 30:02.032
           I'm sorry.
         We must hurry.

30:02.867 --> 30:04.301
         >> Thank you.

30:12.477 --> 30:16.413
   >> Sir, this thing's worse
     than an oyster's fart.

30:16.415 --> 30:17.781
         They knows it.

30:17.783 --> 30:21.151
Runnin' around this scurvy place
   with a gaggle of females.

30:21.153 --> 30:24.655
 >> We have our orders, Joost.
          Under duty.

30:24.657 --> 30:27.825
  >> Aye. But duty never made
      a rotten order sweet

30:27.827 --> 30:29.493
    did it, Captain Stewart?

30:29.495 --> 30:31.795
     Let's move out, Joost.

30:31.797 --> 30:35.065
      >> Company form up.
      Make ready to move.

31:12.604 --> 31:14.605
    >> <i> We've been traveling</i>
           <i> all night</i>

31:14.607 --> 31:20.043
  and half a day. I'm seasick.
   We're not even on the sea.

31:20.045 --> 31:22.279
  Why couldn't we have stayed
          in Pahadpur?

31:22.281 --> 31:25.315
>> Your father told us 20 times
    we'd been made hostages.

31:25.317 --> 31:28.452
    I'd rather be a hostage
  than throw up in this thing.

31:28.454 --> 31:29.987
         >> Oh, golly.

31:29.989 --> 31:34.191
   >> No, I really feel sick.
      I need some brandy.

31:34.193 --> 31:36.326
      >> Yes, but we don't
        have any brandy.

31:39.364 --> 31:41.465
         >> Yes, we do.

31:41.467 --> 31:45.168
 I liberated it from pop's bag
        before we left.

31:45.170 --> 31:47.170
   >> It's bad for his gout,
            anyway.

31:57.815 --> 32:00.384
          >> Captain.
   >> Is all well, Highness?

32:00.386 --> 32:04.187
      Sorry about the pace
         of our travel.

32:04.189 --> 32:07.224
 >> You look worried, captain.
        >> No, Highness.

32:07.226 --> 32:11.128
   >> Really? I saw some men
  in the hills. Following us.

32:11.130 --> 32:14.498
 >> Aye. Possibly Raoji's men.

32:16.367 --> 32:17.467
          >> Possibly.

32:20.805 --> 32:21.805
            >> Hyah!

32:26.611 --> 32:28.979
        >> Oh, Krishna.

32:28.981 --> 32:30.981
  They chose the wrong queen.

32:37.622 --> 32:39.489
         Are you ready?

32:39.491 --> 32:42.125
    >> It's a large escort,
         Your Highness.

32:42.127 --> 32:44.728
  >> I'm paying a large price.

32:52.770 --> 32:56.006
    After her, slit her open

32:56.008 --> 32:59.943
       pull the baby out
      and bring it to me.

33:18.496 --> 33:20.597
       >> Stunning woman,
         Her Highness.

33:20.599 --> 33:24.401
        Never see a face
   like that on Clyde Street.

33:24.403 --> 33:28.105
  James, are we going to be in
          for a fight?

33:28.107 --> 33:32.442
    >> I think they may try
   to ambush us at the bridge
           at Dwarka.

33:32.444 --> 33:34.211
  If we pass it by nightfall,
         we'll be safe.

33:34.213 --> 33:37.714
>> We'll be outnumbered 10 to 1,
   if it comes to an ambush,
           won't we?

33:37.716 --> 33:39.549
      >> Desperate times..

33:39.551 --> 33:41.618
   >> ...desperate measures.

33:59.437 --> 34:00.804
          >> Let's see
      how their dog sepoys

34:00.806 --> 34:03.473
    deal with what you have
     in store, little man.

34:24.395 --> 34:26.396
 >> Don't mention it to anyone.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.902
    >> Let's move. Let's go.
            Come on.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.237
    >> All in order, Joost?

34:34.239 --> 34:37.306
>> Aye. The ladies are sleepin'.
          All of them.

34:37.309 --> 34:39.109
       >> You'll be under
     my brother's command.

34:39.110 --> 34:40.976
  Remember, quiet as a snake.

34:40.978 --> 34:43.045
 You don't want them waking up.
           Go to it.

34:43.047 --> 34:46.817
       >> Good work, sir.
      Alright, let's move.

35:38.870 --> 35:41.471
      >> Run, sepoy dogs!

35:54.052 --> 35:56.052
      Throw me your lance.

35:57.655 --> 35:58.655
             Argh!

36:05.696 --> 36:06.997
             Desai!

36:14.272 --> 36:16.406
     >> Capture the queen.

36:22.980 --> 36:23.980
             Hyah!

36:33.424 --> 36:35.425
      Get back and fight.

36:43.601 --> 36:44.601
              Unh!

37:38.522 --> 37:40.724
             >> Uh.
          >> Come on.

37:45.162 --> 37:47.864
  >> I'm never drinking brandy
             again.

37:47.866 --> 37:48.865
            >> Good.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.401
             Come.

37:52.136 --> 37:53.837
            Oh. Oh.

37:56.474 --> 37:57.974
             Dolly.

38:01.979 --> 38:04.114
       >> <i> Charles saheb.</i>

38:04.116 --> 38:06.316
         Charles <i> saheb</i>

38:06.318 --> 38:07.517
      James <i> saheb</i> is here.

38:07.519 --> 38:09.419
>> Did it go well?

38:09.421 --> 38:11.187
          >> Yes, sir.

38:11.189 --> 38:13.290
           >> James!

38:13.292 --> 38:15.992
    >> Once you were asleep,
  we hid you in the hay carts.

38:15.994 --> 38:18.261
         Out of danger.
       >> You drugged us?

38:18.263 --> 38:21.631
       >> Your Highness,
      take my word for it.

38:21.633 --> 38:24.100
  You were better off asleep.

38:24.102 --> 38:27.170
     Our attackers intended
to kill you. Not to rescue you.

38:27.172 --> 38:29.406
       >> Then let us go.

38:29.408 --> 38:32.609
  >> Your Highness, I've been
    charged with the duty of
    escorting you to Bombay.

38:32.611 --> 38:35.745
    And I can guarantee you
      that you'll be safe

38:35.747 --> 38:37.447
       as long as you are
         in my custody.

38:37.449 --> 38:41.351
 >> And do you have enough men
   to honor such a guarantee?

38:41.353 --> 38:42.786
     >> Yes, Your Highness.

38:46.791 --> 38:48.458
Without guides you'll get lost.

38:48.460 --> 38:49.559
    >> For the last 4 years

38:49.561 --> 38:52.729
    I've been surveying this
       country, Highness.

38:52.731 --> 38:55.732
     We'll take back roads,
     but we won't get lost.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.969
     >> I need some water.

38:59.971 --> 39:00.970
             Come.

39:16.520 --> 39:19.122
>> James, you made me throw up.

39:19.124 --> 39:23.059
         >> No, Dolly,
   you took your own poison.

39:23.061 --> 39:26.096
>> Oh, this -- this isn't mine.
     Clara likes to drink.

39:26.098 --> 39:28.298
     >> Forgive me, ladies,
 but it was a very mild opiate

39:28.300 --> 39:30.200
  and I needed total silence.

39:30.202 --> 39:33.336
>> Men.

39:33.338 --> 39:34.804
         >> I'm sorry.

39:34.806 --> 39:37.073
       >> You don't need
      to apologize, James.

39:37.075 --> 39:40.610
   Actually, I greatly admire
       your imagination.

39:40.612 --> 39:42.612
 >> Thank you, Ms. Coldstream.

39:47.818 --> 39:49.152
          >> Stop it.

40:11.742 --> 40:13.943
    >> Hey, here's a dowry.

40:13.945 --> 40:19.048
    <i> Use it to find a husband</i>
     <i> that is less stubborn.</i>

40:20.684 --> 40:22.218
     I know where they are.

40:25.990 --> 40:27.123
         Towards Dhar.

40:44.942 --> 40:47.043
 >> The royal palanquin burnt,
     but you saw no bodies.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.378
         >> No, father.

40:48.380 --> 40:50.814
 >> It's vital that our people
    know the queen is alive.

40:50.816 --> 40:53.149
     They'll fight loyally
     for her and her child.

40:53.151 --> 40:55.819
Without her, we cannot succeed.

40:55.821 --> 40:57.153
       Stewart is coming.

40:57.155 --> 40:59.422
 Udaji, if the queen is alive,
           find her.

40:59.424 --> 41:02.692
     And for all our sakes,
         make it swift.

41:02.694 --> 41:05.028
      I doubt you will be
     the only one looking.

41:16.006 --> 41:19.375
     >> They've cut us off.

41:19.377 --> 41:20.376
             Well?

41:22.813 --> 41:25.815
     >> We'll skirt through
      on the back of them.

41:25.817 --> 41:28.318
  We take the dragon's throat.

41:28.320 --> 41:29.752
          Okay,<i> chalo.</i>

41:29.754 --> 41:32.755
 >> Dragon's throat? We'll have
    to abandon the animals.

41:32.757 --> 41:35.325
  >> That's the idea, Charlie.

41:35.327 --> 41:38.428
       >> Desai, what is
      the dragon's throat?

41:45.402 --> 41:47.403
  >> <i> Keep it going. That's it.</i>

41:48.906 --> 41:50.907
     Nice and steady, lads.

41:52.877 --> 41:54.477
         <i> >> Oh, my God!</i>

41:54.479 --> 41:56.045
      No, no ,no. I can't.

41:56.047 --> 41:57.947
           >> Tulaja.

41:57.949 --> 42:00.416
     >> No one is looking.

42:00.418 --> 42:02.852
       >> It's very safe.
        >> Don't laugh.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.354
 >> Your Highness, can you run?

42:04.356 --> 42:07.257
>> Yes, for my child, I'll fly.

42:07.259 --> 42:08.424
             >> Go.

42:18.769 --> 42:22.906
>> I think we're supposed to be
    going up the waterfall..

42:22.908 --> 42:23.907
           ...ladies.

42:34.818 --> 42:36.386
          >> Charlie.

42:36.388 --> 42:37.787
       >> Alright, lads.

42:53.037 --> 42:55.238
       >> Is she alright?

42:55.240 --> 42:57.473
   >> Yes. She hurt her ankle
           on a rock.

42:57.475 --> 43:01.511
  So for the most part, she's
    fine. They're both fine.

43:01.513 --> 43:03.012
            >> Both?

43:03.014 --> 43:06.683
  >> Yes, if I'm not mistaken,
    the girl is with child.

43:06.685 --> 43:10.219
  But if we keep up this pace,
    she could lose the baby.

43:50.928 --> 43:53.262
    >> Would you have really
       shot us, captain?

43:53.264 --> 43:55.431
            >> Aye.

43:55.433 --> 43:58.267
      I really would have.

43:58.269 --> 44:01.938
      >> Uh, my servant's
    not too well. I must go.

44:01.940 --> 44:04.507
    >> The queen should rest
 for a while, don't you think?

44:08.412 --> 44:10.913
         It's alright.

44:10.915 --> 44:13.983
  I won't reveal who she is..

44:13.985 --> 44:15.318
       ...Your Highness.

44:17.721 --> 44:21.057
     >> You know who I am..

44:21.059 --> 44:22.592
    ...but still you call me
           highness.

44:22.594 --> 44:24.761
   >> I know who you're not.

44:24.763 --> 44:26.763
        Not who you are.

44:29.166 --> 44:32.001
     Someone once told me..

44:32.003 --> 44:36.406
  ...that the God Lord Krishna
     married 3 princesses.

44:36.408 --> 44:39.409
   And they lived in a palace
        made of silver.

44:39.411 --> 44:42.779
        One day, Krishna
      fell incurably ill.

44:42.781 --> 44:44.213
      A doctor was called.

44:44.215 --> 44:49.018
      And he told the God,
 the only cure for his illness

44:49.020 --> 44:52.755
     was dust from the foot
      of a generous woman.

44:52.757 --> 44:57.226
  <i> But you see the princesses,</i>
        <i> they had no dust</i>
         <i> on their feet.</i>

44:57.228 --> 44:59.529
 So they could not cure Krishna

44:59.531 --> 45:02.031
       no matter how much
        they wished to.

45:02.033 --> 45:05.702
   The doctor did find dust,
            however.

45:05.704 --> 45:07.904
         On the foot of
     a poor shepherd girl.

45:09.840 --> 45:12.041
         And that dust

45:12.043 --> 45:15.144
to the fury of the princesses..

45:15.146 --> 45:17.680
     <i> ...cured Lord Krishna</i>
        <i> of his illness.</i>

45:23.320 --> 45:25.655
          Who are you?

45:30.861 --> 45:32.862
        >> Why don't you
       ask Lord Krishna?

45:35.065 --> 45:37.366
      You seem to believe
    he has all the answers.

45:56.286 --> 45:58.287
>> They are not using the roads.

45:59.623 --> 46:03.159
      Englishman is a fox,
   but I know how he thinks.

46:05.362 --> 46:07.063
  Salim! We'll need extra men.

46:07.065 --> 46:09.899
       Send for Bhavan at
        the Rajwada. Go!

46:21.311 --> 46:23.346
       >> Well, brother.

46:26.150 --> 46:28.050
      We are off the map.

46:28.052 --> 46:30.720
      >> That ruined fort
       down by the river.

46:30.722 --> 46:33.589
       We can rest there
         for the night.

46:33.591 --> 46:34.590
           >> James.

46:37.962 --> 46:40.897
    >> We've been doing this
          for a week.
 Are we going to be be alright?

46:40.899 --> 46:42.999
      >> Oh, don't worry.
      They won't find us.

46:43.001 --> 46:45.301
      Even we don't know,
         where we are.

47:12.429 --> 47:13.429
          >> Captain.

47:15.399 --> 47:17.400
   I brought you some water.

47:30.180 --> 47:32.515
      >> It seems you know
    a lot about my country.

47:32.517 --> 47:35.418
       >> I build roads.

47:35.420 --> 47:38.821
     When you build a road
        across a country

47:38.823 --> 47:41.490
     you soon see its soul.

47:45.829 --> 47:48.731
         >> It appears
     you like what you see.

47:48.733 --> 47:50.600
            >> Aye.

47:50.602 --> 47:52.602
       I like what I see.

48:00.644 --> 48:02.845
I've grown to like it very much.

48:05.482 --> 48:08.017
  >> The English are my enemy.

48:08.019 --> 48:10.586
       > I'm not so fond
        of them myself.

48:12.556 --> 48:14.357
       I'm from Scotland.

48:14.359 --> 48:17.693
    My grandfather supported
        a Scottish king.

48:17.695 --> 48:19.695
     When the English won..

48:21.098 --> 48:23.666
 ...my family lost everything.

48:26.270 --> 48:28.971
     This was our way out.

48:28.973 --> 48:30.072
    When we've saved enough

48:30.074 --> 48:33.676
     my brother and I plan
         to buy a farm

48:33.678 --> 48:35.011
          in America.

48:38.382 --> 48:40.683
          >> America?

48:40.685 --> 48:41.684
       >> Massachusetts.

48:45.222 --> 48:47.390
          We'll leave
     when we're discharged.

48:52.229 --> 48:54.463
         Why won't you
       tell me your name?

48:56.733 --> 48:59.568
          >> It's not
    the custom of my country

48:59.570 --> 49:02.471
  for a woman to give her name
         to a stranger.

49:03.707 --> 49:06.909
         >> Especially
      an English stranger.

49:07.678 --> 49:09.679
            >> Yes.

49:09.681 --> 49:13.449
Especially an English stranger.

49:20.791 --> 49:24.427
  Perhaps, you should hand us
     over to our pursuers.

49:27.497 --> 49:29.565
         This would be
       to your advantage.

49:33.837 --> 49:35.404
        >> I would not.

49:49.386 --> 49:51.787
      >> Is this a custom
        of your country?

49:53.056 --> 49:56.025
  >> I cannot blame my actions
          on Scotland.

50:10.207 --> 50:12.441
         >> They say..

50:12.443 --> 50:14.810
  ...that death is our fate..

50:16.079 --> 50:18.514
...and tomorrow's the end of us.

50:20.150 --> 50:22.718
  >> And do you believe them?

50:26.156 --> 50:27.156
            >> Yes.

50:46.943 --> 50:49.278
     >> What is your name?

50:51.782 --> 50:53.549
        >> Tulaja Naik.

50:57.354 --> 50:58.888
        >> Tulaja Naik.

51:52.776 --> 51:55.211
     >> Set dummies here..

51:55.213 --> 51:57.046
         ...and...here.

51:57.048 --> 51:59.315
     That should lure them
    into the courtyard here.

51:59.317 --> 52:02.785
>> <i> James, is it not coldhearted</i>
  <i> to continue on this escapade</i>

52:02.787 --> 52:05.154
   with such a pregnant girl.

52:05.156 --> 52:08.457
         Or do you not
    care about such things?

52:08.459 --> 52:11.894
    >> I do. As it happens.

52:11.896 --> 52:13.529
         >> I'm sorry.

52:16.133 --> 52:19.068
   But if we cannot hold them

52:19.070 --> 52:22.138
 I assume they are not the kind
 of people who take prisoners.

52:22.140 --> 52:24.406
           >> Clara.

52:24.408 --> 52:27.343
       With you and Dolly
          to defend us

52:27.345 --> 52:31.147
         I do not think
     it will come to that.

52:33.049 --> 52:34.049
            >> Yes.

53:34.278 --> 53:37.580
   >> Dolly, for God's sake,
         be an Egerton.

53:37.582 --> 53:38.581
            <i> Reload!</i>

54:20.624 --> 54:22.157
            >> Argh!

54:27.097 --> 54:29.098
     >> They are my people.

54:43.747 --> 54:46.181
      >> I'll wait for you
       down by the river.

54:46.916 --> 54:47.916
            >> Aye.

54:51.154 --> 54:54.456
      >> Havan, let's find
     those boats. Come on.

55:04.668 --> 55:07.770
>> You are free, Your Highness,
   to go back to your people.

55:07.772 --> 55:10.472
 >> What will they do, captain?

55:10.474 --> 55:13.876
         Your English,
      when they find out?

55:13.878 --> 55:16.445
 >> They'll cashier me or, uh..

55:16.447 --> 55:19.348
      ...court martial me,
          or hang me.

55:19.350 --> 55:21.016
       Perhaps all three.

55:31.261 --> 55:32.695
        >> Why, captain?

55:32.697 --> 55:35.631
 >> They don't take too kindly
     to disobeying orders.

55:35.633 --> 55:38.467
         >> No, why are
       you letting us go?

55:42.806 --> 55:44.940
       >> Her child will
        die, if I don't.

55:47.377 --> 55:48.877
        >> Come with us.

55:51.548 --> 55:53.215
        I'll be honored.

55:54.451 --> 55:55.818
          >> I can't.

55:57.554 --> 55:59.254
       I'm not a traitor.

56:24.748 --> 56:26.115
          Tulaja Naik!

56:34.190 --> 56:37.426
          May Bhawarti
   bless you with good luck.

56:39.129 --> 56:41.296
            Always.

57:18.368 --> 57:20.836
            James..

57:20.838 --> 57:23.772
...you sentimental bloody idiot.

57:37.120 --> 57:39.188
          >> <i> Captain!</i>

57:39.190 --> 57:40.689
            Captain!

57:50.934 --> 57:52.568
            >> Halt!

58:01.277 --> 58:02.644
          >> Captain!

59:27.931 --> 59:29.498
       >> Is he alright?

59:29.500 --> 59:31.266
         >> I think so.

59:38.508 --> 59:40.309
          >> <i> You said</i>
    <i> that they will hang you</i>

59:40.311 --> 59:42.477
       if you don't take
        back a princess.

59:45.081 --> 59:46.748
         Now you will.

59:47.650 --> 59:48.884
  >> But when they discover --

59:48.886 --> 59:51.320
    >> They don't even know,
   what the queen looks like.

59:51.322 --> 59:55.023
   >> No, it's too dangerous.

59:55.025 --> 59:58.660
      >> By the time they
 realize, I will have escaped.

59:58.662 --> 01:00:00.395
     >> It's not that easy.

01:00:00.397 --> 01:00:03.999
   However polite they seem..

01:00:04.001 --> 01:00:06.234
...they'll put you under guard.

01:00:06.236 --> 01:00:07.869
    >> This is my country..

01:00:10.239 --> 01:00:13.575
    ...where you foreigners
    see a crack in the rock

01:00:13.577 --> 01:00:15.744
         I see a door.

01:00:15.746 --> 01:00:19.414
         When I'm gone,
  no blame will attach to you.

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:38.467
        Is there someone
       waiting for you..

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:41.136
      ...in Massachusetts?

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:43.605
     >> It's an odd thing.

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:50.946
  Whenever I imagine happiness
     with another person..

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:58.186
   ...I have this premonition
  that I won't be allowed it.

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:03.859
  >> How sad that is, captain.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.468
  >> So, Tulaja Naik has gone
       with the British?

01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:15.604
  >> To distract my pursuers.

01:01:15.606 --> 01:01:18.940
  So, they would still believe
      I'm in their hands.

01:01:18.942 --> 01:01:21.510
 >> She did an honorable thing.
         >> Sleep now.

01:01:21.512 --> 01:01:23.679
        Jamnabai, rest.

01:01:23.681 --> 01:01:26.348
      Rest for the sake of
    the new soul you carry.

01:01:33.122 --> 01:01:35.223
>> Allow me to attack the boat,
            father.

01:01:35.225 --> 01:01:38.794
 >> Uh-huh. Udaji, there are 2
 things about the British that
  really wake my insecurities.

01:01:38.796 --> 01:01:41.363
  First is their artillery and
second is the uncanny abilities

01:01:41.365 --> 01:01:43.732
   some British have to touch
   the hearts of our people.

01:01:43.734 --> 01:01:45.367
   >> Father, I can do this.

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:56.044
  >> Let this Captain Stewart
         make landfall.

01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:59.414
Then Tulaja Naik is to be taken
        from their hands
       and brought here.

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:19.067
     >> Hurry up, hurry up.

01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:21.036
         Out. Come on.

01:02:22.004 --> 01:02:23.872
          >> My king!

01:02:23.874 --> 01:02:25.741
      >> No longer a king.

01:02:25.743 --> 01:02:29.344
   Ex-queen Jamnabai has been
     taken from the British
          by Killedar.

01:02:29.346 --> 01:02:33.081
     He has raised an army.
   It's going to destroy us.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:36.017
   >> Why are you doing this?

01:02:36.019 --> 01:02:37.886
       >> My enemies now
        have their queen

01:02:37.888 --> 01:02:40.021
        and the British
       have abandoned me.

01:02:40.023 --> 01:02:41.957
    You said we could trust
          the British.

01:02:41.959 --> 01:02:44.326
     Where are the soldiers
     they promised us, huh?

01:02:44.328 --> 01:02:47.829
      They move us around
  like pieces on a chessboard.

01:02:47.831 --> 01:02:49.998
      Who knows what their
      next move would be.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.601
      >> So, you abandoned
   your throne like a coward?

01:02:55.004 --> 01:02:56.905
 >> You're free to come with us

01:02:56.907 --> 01:02:59.875
    if you can find yourself
            a horse.

01:02:59.877 --> 01:03:03.678
   >> And what? Live the rest
  of my life scurrying around
          like a rat?

01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:09.951
         >> Look at us.
       A rat and a viper.

01:03:12.155 --> 01:03:13.321
          >> My lord!

01:03:13.323 --> 01:03:15.457
      >> Stay here, woman,
       with your animal.

01:03:15.459 --> 01:03:18.927
      When hunger strikes,
        you'll soon know
 which of you is the stronger.

01:03:29.172 --> 01:03:31.106
           >> <i> Dolly!</i>

01:03:31.108 --> 01:03:33.675
         Dolly! Dolly!

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:36.178
             Look!

01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:44.853
   >> Oh heaven! We're saved.

01:03:44.855 --> 01:03:45.887
          <i> Oh, my God!</i>

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:49.591
             Saved.
              Ha.

01:03:58.167 --> 01:04:01.436
        >> Your alliance
  with Raoji and his cowardice

01:04:01.438 --> 01:04:04.806
 has left us mightily exposed.

01:04:04.808 --> 01:04:06.741
   Don't you think, colonel?

01:04:06.743 --> 01:04:08.944
  >> On the contrary, governor

01:04:08.946 --> 01:04:12.314
   I believe his predicament

01:04:12.316 --> 01:04:15.283
gives us a greater opportunity.

01:04:15.285 --> 01:04:18.220
     >> Which we shall leap
     to take advantage of.

01:04:20.424 --> 01:04:26.027
    >> I propose, we invade
     Purandhar fort with..

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:31.366
  Restore Raoji to the throne
 under certain new conditions.

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:34.970
    Which I have negotiated.

01:04:35.938 --> 01:04:40.942
             Gold!
    Bullion bars and coins!

01:04:40.944 --> 01:04:45.280
       5 hundred thousand
        ounces per year

01:04:45.282 --> 01:04:47.082
          for 5 years.

01:04:47.084 --> 01:04:50.852
    Payable to the company.
    Calculate your bonuses,
           gentlemen

01:04:50.854 --> 01:04:52.287
          >> Yum, yum.

01:04:52.289 --> 01:04:57.325
  >> Yes and with the ex-queen
       still our guest..

01:04:57.327 --> 01:05:00.896
 ...we still have, in reserve,
       a bargaining chip

01:05:00.898 --> 01:05:03.365
 we can use on the either side.

01:05:04.867 --> 01:05:06.735
    Which ever way it goes.

01:05:06.737 --> 01:05:09.070
        >> But...London!

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:11.139
           Gentlemen,
    his majesty's government

01:05:11.141 --> 01:05:13.375
    will strenuously object
          to all this.

01:05:13.377 --> 01:05:16.311
>> I think the vast sum of money
            involved

01:05:16.313 --> 01:05:19.514
  will mollify their scruples.

01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:21.917
           >> Indeed.

01:05:21.919 --> 01:05:23.451
   And while it maybe argued

01:05:23.453 --> 01:05:26.988
    that the Colonel Egerton
has stirred up a hornet's nest.

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:28.223
          We can, now.

01:05:28.225 --> 01:05:30.692
           This time,
       rightfully plead..

01:05:31.894 --> 01:05:34.329
        ...self defense.

01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:36.097
      >> War, it is then!

01:05:38.034 --> 01:05:39.567
War!

01:05:57.286 --> 01:05:58.887
           >> James!

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:03.358
      >> <i> It appears we're</i>
       <i> officially at war.</i>

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.993
   <i> I have to leave tomorrow.</i>

01:06:04.995 --> 01:06:07.162
   <i> We must address the issue,</i>
        <i> of your escape.</i>

01:06:22.445 --> 01:06:23.578
     Is everything alright?

01:06:29.118 --> 01:06:33.154
     <i> >> Guru Dev. Am I such</i>
      <i> a person, Guru Dev?</i>

01:06:41.263 --> 01:06:45.233
 >> I've dreamt of this moment.
           >> Tulaja.

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:52.507
      Will you forgive me
      if I speak my mind?

01:06:59.915 --> 01:07:02.350
   You have deeply touched me

01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:05.920
       with your person,
        with your wisdom

01:07:05.922 --> 01:07:09.791
 your courage, your canniness.

01:07:12.995 --> 01:07:15.563
    If you could find it in
  your heart, to reciprocate.

01:07:15.565 --> 01:07:17.499
     My happiness would be
         immeasurable.

01:07:17.501 --> 01:07:18.666
           >> James!

01:07:20.169 --> 01:07:23.505
 >> I never thought it would be
      in my luck to love.

01:07:23.507 --> 01:07:26.808
    But plainly, as you see,
     I'm in love with you.

01:07:28.077 --> 01:07:30.512
  I have nothing to offer you
          but myself.

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.814
          My loyalty.

01:07:35.017 --> 01:07:36.384
            Tulaja!

01:07:38.587 --> 01:07:39.854
          Dare I hope.

01:07:56.505 --> 01:07:57.672
           >> James!

01:08:00.142 --> 01:08:02.310
 I have closed my heart tight.

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:09.484
           I cannot.

01:08:13.155 --> 01:08:15.824
         >> You cannot?

01:08:15.826 --> 01:08:18.026
 >> My heart is closed, James.

01:08:23.999 --> 01:08:25.300
    You must look elsewhere.

01:08:26.469 --> 01:08:27.801
            >> Why?

01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:31.606
   <i> Why is your heart closed?</i>

01:08:36.312 --> 01:08:37.612
            Tulaja!

01:08:39.014 --> 01:08:40.348
          Look at me.

01:08:44.687 --> 01:08:45.819
            <i> Please.</i>

01:09:11.913 --> 01:09:15.617
      Well, then I'm...I'm
        taking it back..

01:09:19.287 --> 01:09:22.122
       Please, forgive me
 if I have misread your heart.

01:09:31.133 --> 01:09:33.033
  I must organize your escape.

01:09:35.804 --> 01:09:38.606
     >> It's not necessary.

01:09:38.608 --> 01:09:43.845
>> You told me that a Maharatha
  does not like to be outdone

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:45.580
   in paying a debt of honor.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:50.118
     Neither does a Scott.

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:53.755
          Tulaja Naik.

01:10:50.613 --> 01:10:53.081
      The guards change in
      20 minutes. Go, go!

01:11:07.696 --> 01:11:09.330
  >> Return the key, quickly.

01:11:09.332 --> 01:11:11.132
          Now, go, go.

01:11:17.172 --> 01:11:21.976
          >> Damn him!
       It fucking bit me.

01:11:22.645 --> 01:11:24.245
            Damn it!

01:11:24.247 --> 01:11:26.114
             Desai!

01:11:26.116 --> 01:11:27.548
           >> <i> Sahib!</i>

01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:28.683
             Shoes.

01:11:32.087 --> 01:11:36.758
    >> Well, I might as well
      check on the queen.

01:11:38.193 --> 01:11:39.694
        Get me the keys.

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:45.099
      >> We must be quick.

01:11:47.403 --> 01:11:49.437
       <i> Come on, quickly.</i>
            <i> Come on!</i>

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:08.356
            >> Sir!

01:12:08.358 --> 01:12:11.092
Sir, Raoji has come from Kalyan.

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:13.461
          >> Dash it.

01:12:13.463 --> 01:12:17.632
      It's not one pissing
   little pest, it's another.

01:12:28.577 --> 01:12:31.813
          >> Escaped!
            Escaped!

01:12:31.815 --> 01:12:34.882
      The door was locked.
         I had the key.

01:12:34.884 --> 01:12:37.218
             Desai!

01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:40.455
   This is treachery, damn it
  not the fucking road trick.

01:12:40.457 --> 01:12:43.458
      Call out the guard.
           Find her.

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:46.027
  Ah, Stewart, something fishy
           going on.

01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:47.428
    Well, I'll sniff it out.

01:13:39.548 --> 01:13:43.050
  >> <i> You are a part of time..</i>

01:13:43.052 --> 01:13:46.854
  <i> ...what the ancients called</i>
          <i> sarwadaiti.</i>

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:51.426
     <i> That's which contains</i>
          <i> everything.</i>

01:14:04.473 --> 01:14:06.441
   >> I feel you there, Jay.

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:11.078
      Where are you, baby?

01:14:14.516 --> 01:14:16.083
      Where are you, baby?

01:14:19.388 --> 01:14:21.122
       >> <i> Where are you?</i>

01:14:22.925 --> 01:14:24.325
          >> <i> Damn it!</i>

01:14:24.327 --> 01:14:26.027
            Damn it!

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:30.865
  Is that the real queen girl,
            you say?

01:14:30.867 --> 01:14:31.933
           Damn him.

01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:37.338
   Stewart knew all the time.

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:40.441
    Mastin, don't you think
         he's damnable?

01:14:40.443 --> 01:14:43.144
        Don't you think
    he should be cashiered?

01:14:43.146 --> 01:14:45.213
 >> No, it's of no matter now.

01:14:45.215 --> 01:14:47.181
   >> It matters to me, dear.

01:14:50.252 --> 01:14:53.321
      I'll wager he saw it
        as a humane act.

01:14:53.323 --> 01:14:57.725
  >> An empire is not made on
        humane act, sir.

01:14:57.727 --> 01:15:00.862
             Damn!
           Damn him!

01:15:00.864 --> 01:15:02.897
 >> You'll have to get used to
          it, Egerton.

01:15:02.899 --> 01:15:06.634
     I fear Captain Stewart
  is the voice of the future.

01:15:06.636 --> 01:15:07.935
          >> Not mine.

01:15:09.838 --> 01:15:12.607
      He's a threat to all
  the company stands to gain.

01:15:12.609 --> 01:15:14.442
  All England stands to gain.

01:15:14.444 --> 01:15:18.579
>> There is the Roman solution.
            >> What?

01:15:18.581 --> 01:15:21.349
   >> In battle how many men
       ever make it back

01:15:21.351 --> 01:15:23.684
from leading the advance guard.

01:15:23.686 --> 01:15:27.121
   No one from His Majesty's
    point of view is fitter

01:15:27.123 --> 01:15:30.024
   to lead the advance guard
         than Stewart.

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:32.960
      <i> And no one from your</i>
    <i> point of view is fitter</i>

01:15:32.962 --> 01:15:34.829
       <i> to not come back.</i>

01:15:34.831 --> 01:15:36.030
             <i> Voila.</i>

01:15:39.568 --> 01:15:41.602
        <i> >> Clara, Clara!</i>

01:15:44.339 --> 01:15:46.674
      How could you do it?

01:15:46.676 --> 01:15:49.844
  How could you? You love him.
        You love James.

01:15:49.846 --> 01:15:51.679
    >> Eves dropping again.

01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:55.383
  >> Yes, I heard everything.

01:15:55.385 --> 01:15:57.118
    I know what you've done.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.620
    >> And have you enjoyed
       being enlightened?

01:15:59.622 --> 01:16:01.556
        >> You're snake.

01:16:01.558 --> 01:16:03.824
        >> How dare you!

01:16:03.826 --> 01:16:05.826
 You who have money and youth.

01:16:05.828 --> 01:16:07.161
        I have nothing.

01:16:07.163 --> 01:16:09.797
  Now I've something and it's
    nothing to be proud of.

01:16:09.799 --> 01:16:13.334
   But I will settle for it.

01:16:13.336 --> 01:16:15.836
 >> What about all those things
  you said to me about loving

01:16:15.838 --> 01:16:17.338
 and counting ourselves lucky.

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:18.639
  Doesn't that mean anything?

01:16:18.641 --> 01:16:21.876
 >> Love has many faces and one
      of them is jealousy.

01:16:21.878 --> 01:16:24.712
  <i> And you, you keep telling me</i>
       <i> to act and I have.</i>

01:16:24.714 --> 01:16:27.715
   And there's something that
   I've always wanted to do.

01:16:27.717 --> 01:16:29.584
     I'm not your servant.

01:16:29.586 --> 01:16:30.785
            >> Aah!

01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:36.591
     >> That is the end of
       lessons for today.

01:16:36.593 --> 01:16:40.227
    And don't think that you
   can get rid of me because
     I'm coming to America

01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:42.997
   with you and your father.
        It's all agreed.

01:16:42.999 --> 01:16:45.032
        When we set off,
     I'll be your governess

01:16:45.034 --> 01:16:49.036
   and by the time we arrive,
       your step mother..

01:16:50.239 --> 01:16:52.974
      <i> >> You've driven out</i>
        <i> yourself, Raoji.</i>

01:16:52.976 --> 01:16:55.743
        <i> Now the British</i>
      <i> declared war on us.</i>

01:16:55.745 --> 01:16:57.878
         <i> Shall we allow</i>
       <i> them to do to us.</i>

01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:59.413
     What they did to Oudh!

01:16:59.415 --> 01:17:01.115
     To Bengal, to Madras?

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:02.283
              No!

01:17:03.386 --> 01:17:05.686
  <i> Let us end their ambitions.</i>

01:17:05.688 --> 01:17:08.990
   <i> Let us send them home back</i>
    <i> to their little island.</i>

01:17:08.992 --> 01:17:11.392
    They shall not rule us.

01:17:12.762 --> 01:17:14.929
 May the Gods bless our queen.

01:17:16.832 --> 01:17:18.432
        Let them hear..

01:17:18.434 --> 01:17:21.369
     ...bounce your shouts,
        off the clouds!

01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:03.077
     <i> >> Tell me about this</i>
        <i> Caption Stewart.</i>

01:18:05.914 --> 01:18:08.949
    >> He's a leader of men.

01:18:08.951 --> 01:18:12.853
      >> He inspires love
         in our people.

01:18:12.855 --> 01:18:15.823
 >> Some people say so, father.

01:18:15.825 --> 01:18:19.060
   >> Then it will benefit us
     to arrange his death.

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:33.407
      >> Copy her writing
       and her signature.

01:18:33.409 --> 01:18:37.011
 In this Stewart is a good man.
I take no delight in doing this.

01:18:37.013 --> 01:18:38.746
         But my father
       fought the British

01:18:38.748 --> 01:18:41.048
    and he said "it's easier
     to wrestle the python

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:43.284
     after you have chopped
        it's head off."

01:18:43.286 --> 01:18:44.885
      Let's bait the trap.

01:19:14.216 --> 01:19:17.051
        >> My father has
        given me a duty.

01:19:17.053 --> 01:19:19.453
 To harass the English advance.

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:26.127
      >> Udaji, I've done
       a terrible thing.

01:19:26.129 --> 01:19:29.630
       I didn't tell the
  Englishman of the prophecy.

01:19:29.632 --> 01:19:32.700
    >> So, what the old man
     said has come to pass.

01:19:32.702 --> 01:19:34.335
            I know.

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:39.173
           I'm sorry.

01:19:39.175 --> 01:19:42.676
      >> They're gonna try
    and use me to harm him.

01:19:42.678 --> 01:19:44.745
    And he won't be warned.

01:19:47.048 --> 01:19:50.284
    >> So, what will you do?

01:19:50.286 --> 01:19:51.952
           >> Refuse.

01:19:53.655 --> 01:19:55.623
      >> You would betray
        your own people?

01:19:55.625 --> 01:19:57.525
             >> No.

01:19:57.527 --> 01:20:00.995
         Can't you see,
         I'm bad luck.

01:20:02.397 --> 01:20:06.700
  >> Sometimes you have to see
   beyond ourselves, Taluja.

01:20:06.702 --> 01:20:09.470
    We all make sacrifices.

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:15.543
        I once told you,
       "life was simple."

01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:19.647
          I was wrong.

01:20:23.385 --> 01:20:25.553
May the Goddess hold you to her.

01:20:38.233 --> 01:20:40.034
     >> James, forgive me.

01:20:41.403 --> 01:20:44.338
I would never let them harm you.

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:45.472
             Never.

01:22:01.283 --> 01:22:02.650
 >> Everything we call reality

01:22:02.652 --> 01:22:06.053
      is composed of tiny
      particles of energy.

01:22:06.055 --> 01:22:09.356
   Now when 2 particles meet,
    one will spin clockwise

01:22:09.358 --> 01:22:12.426
       and the other will
    spin counter clockwise.

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:15.362
      And if you separate
      those two particles

01:22:15.364 --> 01:22:17.231
to the obsidian of the universe

01:22:17.233 --> 01:22:20.601
    to the obsidian of time.

01:22:20.603 --> 01:22:22.770
And then alter the spin of one.

01:22:22.772 --> 01:22:25.773
     The spin of the other
        will also alter.

01:22:25.775 --> 01:22:27.975
        Instantaneously.

01:22:27.977 --> 01:22:31.412
      Communication across
        space and time.

01:22:40.622 --> 01:22:43.290
  >> Have you got everything?
         >> You ready.

01:22:43.292 --> 01:22:44.558
           Let's go.

01:23:01.109 --> 01:23:02.810
   >> Through space and time.

01:23:41.282 --> 01:23:44.018
   >> Oh, Shivaji, not that.

01:23:53.695 --> 01:23:56.930
     >> Straighten the road
       at 350 yards at..

01:23:58.967 --> 01:24:00.234
         ...10 degrees.

01:24:02.904 --> 01:24:04.872
     No sign of the enemy.

01:24:06.941 --> 01:24:09.176
           They'll be
      out there somewhere.

01:24:09.178 --> 01:24:12.146
        >> James <i> sahib..</i>

01:24:12.148 --> 01:24:15.616
  What if the enemy finds us?

01:24:15.618 --> 01:24:18.118
     >> Hartley and Egerton
   will join us by nightfall.

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.386
         We'll be safe.

01:24:35.770 --> 01:24:39.039
 >> Now let's the Gods decide.
       I've done enough.

01:25:36.798 --> 01:25:38.832
    >> It's not the destiny
         of such a ring

01:25:38.834 --> 01:25:42.336
      to remain separated
    from it's twin,<i> Ishtur.</i>

01:25:42.338 --> 01:25:43.904
         So it is said.

01:25:47.308 --> 01:25:49.109
    >> Let's hope so, Desai.

01:27:06.721 --> 01:27:08.422
            >> Wait.

01:27:08.424 --> 01:27:11.725
      Oh my God! I see it.
        Allie, I see it.

01:27:11.727 --> 01:27:14.928
          I found it!
          I found it!

01:27:23.304 --> 01:27:24.805
      >> Colonel Egerton.
        >> Ah, Hartley.

01:27:24.807 --> 01:27:28.175
>> When can we move, to support
    Stewart's advance guard?

01:27:28.177 --> 01:27:30.444
          >> Tomorrow.
          >> Tomorrow?

01:27:30.446 --> 01:27:32.646
  Sir, we can't leave Stewart
       exposed till then?

01:27:32.648 --> 01:27:36.917
   >> As I say, you will wait
till rest of the army gets here.

01:27:37.785 --> 01:27:38.885
           Tomorrow.

01:27:56.537 --> 01:27:59.740
>> Allie, you take it okay. I've
gotta get back to the hospital.

01:27:59.742 --> 01:28:01.341
    You know what to do do.
          I can't say.

01:28:01.343 --> 01:28:02.643
       >> I'll call you.
            >> Yeah.

01:29:09.410 --> 01:29:12.979
        >> James <i> sahib!</i>
  Please don't leave the camp.

01:29:19.187 --> 01:29:22.155
 I arranged her escape,<i> Ishtur.</i>

01:29:22.157 --> 01:29:23.957
       It was necessary.

01:29:23.959 --> 01:29:26.259
     I wanted to tell you.

01:29:26.261 --> 01:29:30.230
    Krishna knows...I don't
     love you any the less.

01:29:31.366 --> 01:29:32.999
     >> We do what we must.

01:32:51.132 --> 01:32:52.799
            >> Argh.

01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:28.555
      >> Warn Dr. Nutting.

01:35:39.934 --> 01:35:41.735
        >> And the ring?

01:35:44.872 --> 01:35:46.873
     >> It was just a ring.

01:35:46.875 --> 01:35:48.174
       >> <i> So it may seem.</i>

01:35:49.443 --> 01:35:51.678
     But it is a messenger.

01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:54.180
    And what is its message?

01:35:57.785 --> 01:35:59.285
       >> Love, Guru Dev.

01:35:59.287 --> 01:36:01.488
             >> <i> Ah!</i>

01:36:01.490 --> 01:36:05.291
        <i> So, do you love?</i>

01:36:11.265 --> 01:36:12.899
       >> It's too late.

01:36:15.035 --> 01:36:16.669
    It's too late, Guru Dev.

01:36:19.473 --> 01:36:21.775
 >> <i> How does time flow, Tulaja?</i>

01:36:21.777 --> 01:36:25.145
    >> Time flows like one.

01:36:25.147 --> 01:36:27.080
     Like water in a pool.

01:36:28.482 --> 01:36:29.949
          As you said.

01:37:07.989 --> 01:37:12.692
 >> Mrs. Fennel, if you insert
     this card to that slot

01:37:12.694 --> 01:37:14.594
  it'll turn off the machines.

01:37:14.596 --> 01:37:15.662
         >> Thank you.

01:38:23.530 --> 01:38:24.564
           >> Allie!

01:38:30.237 --> 01:38:31.771
             Allie!

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:34.741
            Come on.

01:39:23.457 --> 01:39:24.590
         >> I love you.

01:39:31.966 --> 01:39:33.800
          I love you.

01:40:12.306 --> 01:40:13.740
             >> Oh.

01:40:24.651 --> 01:40:26.586
           >> <i> Laura.</i>

01:40:28.756 --> 01:40:30.356
          >> <i> Darling?</i>

01:40:32.893 --> 01:40:34.660
        <i> Yes, sweetheart.</i>

01:40:37.364 --> 01:40:39.332
   >> You didn't think I'd...
          Think I'd...

01:40:41.435 --> 01:40:42.735
          think I'd...

01:40:44.571 --> 01:40:47.040
     miss our anniversary,
            did you?

01:40:51.812 --> 01:40:52.879
             >> No.

01:40:53.881 --> 01:40:55.982
         Of course not.

01:40:57.451 --> 01:40:59.018
         Oh, thank God.

01:41:01.288 --> 01:41:03.689
      I love you so much.

01:41:17.004 --> 01:41:22.241
     >> Of such entangling,
     is our universe woven.

01:41:24.478 --> 01:41:28.548
  A hard pattern you may say,
       this path of love.

01:41:31.518 --> 01:41:35.721
        But how, child,
     could it be otherwise?
