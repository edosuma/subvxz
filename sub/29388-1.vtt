02:48.502 --> 02:49.801
Uh, are you Chloe?

02:53.941 --> 02:56.341

02:56.710 --> 02:57.776
Oh, right.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.460

- Guys, hey!

06:05.032 --> 06:07.432
- How's it going?
- What the fuck took you so long?

06:07.568 --> 06:11.103
Uh, sorry. There was a lot
of traffic on the interstate.

06:11.105 --> 06:12.838
Do you know where we going?

06:12.840 --> 06:14.106
Uh, no.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.408
Then why the fuck
are you driving?

06:17.578 --> 06:19.678
I figured it wouldn't hurt
to get moving.

06:20.447 --> 06:22.013
You don't know what the fuck
going on, bruh.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.682
How you know it

Hey, nigga,

Hey, nigga.

Don't y'all "Mazz" me, nigga.
How the shit?

07:37.624 --> 07:38.857
It's been moving, but it's slow.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.892
- Slow but moving, huh?
- Yo.

07:41.795 --> 07:42.894
Check it.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.464
What the fuck is that?

07:45.599 --> 07:46.965
That's the new whip, bro.

- Oh, I'm jealous.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.907

Get rid of that shit, nigga.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.168

- Get rid of that shit, nigga.

08:05.552 --> 08:06.952
You see that shit? Hmm?

08:06.954 --> 08:09.588
Ain't nobody gonna think

That's 'cause you got <i> To Catch</i>
<i>a Predator</i> in there, bro.

08:36.850 --> 08:37.916
This week?

08:37.918 --> 08:41.119

Hmm? I know y'all little niggas

Oh. Open your shit, nigga.

Look, Gumby even knows, bro.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.695
You think I give a fuck

09:23.697 --> 09:25.096

10:08.709 --> 10:10.208

10:10.210 --> 10:12.611
It's just how I look.

10:15.349 --> 10:17.015
Just drive the car, nigga.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.955
- Drive the fuckin' car, bruh.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.290

10:32.399 --> 10:33.665
Yo.

Yeah, hold on.

10:38.105 --> 10:41.039
Hey, take me to the crib.
Yeah. No.

10:45.345 --> 10:46.778
Shut the fuck up.

10:47.381 --> 10:49.114
Shut the fuck...
Bruh, you know how stupid

10:49.116 --> 10:50.749

10:51.852 --> 10:53.184
You think I do shit
without knowing

10:53.186 --> 10:54.819
the fuckin' consequences, bruh?

10:56.790 --> 10:57.922
Yeah, okay.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.658
So what's the solution?

11:00.127 --> 11:01.192
Yeah.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.196
Is you ready to die?

11:06.066 --> 11:07.966
Okay, well, then pay that man
then, nigga.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.488
Consider it the cost
of doing business.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.070
You could strap up.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.005
No, strap the fuck up, bruh.

11:14.741 --> 11:16.241
What's it worth to you? Huh?

11:17.377 --> 11:18.810
Cash or blood?

11:20.147 --> 11:21.680
Yeah, okay, then.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.082
Yeah. All right.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.858
Shit, shit, shit.

11:34.428 --> 11:37.328
Is this gonna be it for the day?

11:38.231 --> 11:39.364
I say that?

11:40.133 --> 11:41.199
I just...

11:42.436 --> 11:44.135
The day's just startin', bruh.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.106
Okay.

11:48.107 --> 11:49.874
It's just I have to make
a stop later.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.143
I could use some cash,
if that's all right.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.112
I ain't gonna pay you now.
That ain't the deal.

11:55.415 --> 11:56.715
Well...

11:57.317 --> 11:59.050
I don't think I'm being unfair.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.053
Ain't no such thing as fair.

12:02.456 --> 12:04.255
Shit just is what it is.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.458
We got an agreement.
You drive for me

12:06.460 --> 12:09.227
when I need you. End of the day,
you will get your two bills.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.429
You don't like that shit,
I'll find somebody else who do.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.465
- No, no.
- This ain't no 9 to 5.

12:13.467 --> 12:15.366
- That's not what I...
- Feel me?

12:15.368 --> 12:16.868
We have an agreement.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.803
You don't need to find
anyone else.

12:18.805 --> 12:19.805
Yeah.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.228
All right. Later tonight, nigga.

12:43.764 --> 12:45.063
Okay. Text me.

12:45.966 --> 12:49.267
Man, shit go good,
might get your ass a bonus.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.302
More than you make
on this dumb-ass app.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.575
Keep your shit close, though.

12:56.576 --> 12:57.876
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- We're gonna look at Dada.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.178
Look at Daddy. He's right here.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.587
- He's right here, baby.
- Look at my Prince.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.283
Look at my Prince. Hey!

13:05.285 --> 13:06.785
Come give Daddy a hug.

13:06.787 --> 13:08.353
Come give me a hug, boy.

13:08.855 --> 13:10.889
- Come here. Hey.
- Look at Daddy.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.423
Look at him. Look at my Prince.

13:12.425 --> 13:15.059
Look at my Prince.
Look, I got something for you.

13:15.061 --> 13:17.395
Daddy got something for you.
Look at this. Look, look, look.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.864
- Look, Prince. Look what...
- See that? Look at all that.

13:19.866 --> 13:22.033
- Oh, look, baby.
- I got it for you, son.

13:22.035 --> 13:24.936
- That's for you.
- That's for you. Mm-hmm.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.272
You gonna rule the world
one day, son.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.506
You hear me?

13:29.142 --> 13:30.208
Mm-hmm.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.213
All that. Look at that.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.184
Come on, man.
Get the fuck on, bruh.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.419
Uh, tell him.

13:41.888 --> 13:45.023
I already went in.
I gave you money for pump 11.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.292
- <i>Are you at pump 10?</i>
- No, not pump 10.

13:47.294 --> 13:50.562
I'm at pump 11. Can you
just switch it to pump 11?

13:50.564 --> 13:52.463
<i>I need you to come inside.</i>

13:52.465 --> 13:54.899
- Oh...
- Cam?

13:55.836 --> 13:57.836
Hey, man. I thought
that was you. How's it goin?

13:58.305 --> 14:01.272
Oh, Greg. Hey, hey.
What's goin' on?

14:01.474 --> 14:04.242
- What have you been up to?
- Oh, I'm hanging out.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.311
I'm doing well. Thanks.
How are you doing?

14:06.313 --> 14:09.614
Good. Kids and I
just hit up the trampoline park.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.516
Hey, kids. Say hi to Cam.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.184
Hi.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.253
You should take your...

14:16.156 --> 14:17.689
- son...
- Adam.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.250
Yeah.
You got to take Adam there.

14:19.926 --> 14:20.992
Yeah.

14:21.928 --> 14:23.294
Miss seeing you around work.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.630
That whole thing that happened.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.932
You know,
they really screwed you.

14:27.934 --> 14:29.167
You didn't deserve that.

14:31.071 --> 14:35.940
You know, it ended up
being all right, you know?

14:35.942 --> 14:38.409
- I'm doing good, and...
- It's a coffee shop.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.579
- What?
- Ground floor at work.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.414
You called it.
It's a coffee shop now.

14:44.517 --> 14:47.485
The coffee sucks,
but the baristas...

14:49.222 --> 14:50.288
Well, look, man.

14:50.290 --> 14:53.391
We should catch up sometime.
Maybe get in 18 over at Liberty.

14:54.060 --> 14:57.095
Yeah. Yeah, that...
We definitely got to do that.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.530
Cool. Take care
of yourself, all right, Cam?

15:20.086 --> 15:22.420
I thought it was, like,
multiples of four or...

15:22.422 --> 15:24.389
Okay. Whatever you say.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.357
What, are you just here for,
like, motivation?

15:26.359 --> 15:28.293
Yeah, I'm here for support.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.479
<i>Nine-one-one,
what's your emergency?</i>

15:48.481 --> 15:50.682
Hi, can you please send
a police officer

15:50.684 --> 15:53.017
to nine-three-three
Willow Street?

15:53.019 --> 15:55.019
My husband just pulled up
in my driveway.

15:55.021 --> 15:56.287
He's not supposed to be here.

16:11.004 --> 16:12.070
Hey.

16:13.707 --> 16:15.440
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I...

16:15.442 --> 16:17.041
I was in between fares,
so I thought

16:17.043 --> 16:18.376
I'd swing by, see Adam.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.112
The police are on their way.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.381
- Wh... What?
- I have to protect my son.

16:24.417 --> 16:27.251
I don't know if you remember,
but he's my son, too.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.053
You look like shit.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.522
- No, I don't.
- I'm serious.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.424
Are you taking your medication?

16:34.327 --> 16:36.494
- Where's Adam?
- You know...

16:37.230 --> 16:40.064
you're not allowed to see him
without supervision,

16:40.066 --> 16:42.100
not to mention you're late
on your payment again.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.302
Why is it always about money
with you?

16:45.372 --> 16:46.504
You need help.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.072
No. No, no, no, Becca.

16:48.074 --> 16:51.542
What I need is for you
and everyone else

16:51.544 --> 16:54.612
on this fucking planet
to stop sabotaging me.

16:54.614 --> 16:57.281
- Listen. Listen, Becca.
- You should go.

16:57.283 --> 17:01.219
Just let me see Adam,
all right, and let him know

17:01.221 --> 17:04.454
that I'm not whatever you
and my family are telling him.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.790
- No one is telling him anything.
- You're a fucking liar!

17:06.792 --> 17:09.426
That's your problem.
You're a fucking liar!

17:09.762 --> 17:11.496
Adam, go inside!

17:11.498 --> 17:13.330
Hey, buddy! Hey.

17:14.166 --> 17:15.266
Hey, look.

17:15.268 --> 17:18.368
Whatever your mom's telling you
about me, it's, like,

17:18.371 --> 17:19.470
it's not true.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.422
For some reason, she's trying
to turn you against me.

17:21.423 --> 17:23.373
You should go now
before you lose any right

17:23.376 --> 17:25.175
- you have left to him.
- Oh, wait a minute.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.743
Are you threatening me
with my own child?

17:26.746 --> 17:28.679
- Is that what you're doing?
- What's goin' on here, folks?

17:28.681 --> 17:30.648
Officer, he has supervised

17:30.650 --> 17:32.817
- visitation and he showed up.
- Oh, don't fall

17:32.819 --> 17:34.318
for these fucking tears!

17:34.320 --> 17:36.587
I mean, is this the world
that we live in, where...

17:36.589 --> 17:38.556
Where a father can't even see
his own son?

17:38.558 --> 17:40.491
- I need you to calm down.
- You want me

17:40.493 --> 17:43.161
to fucking calm down?
I'm asking for a natural right!

17:43.163 --> 17:44.462
- Sir...
- It's natural, right?

17:44.464 --> 17:45.663
- You know what? Fuck this!
- Sir!

17:45.665 --> 17:47.498
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Ah! Fuck!

17:48.535 --> 17:49.834
Ow! Geez! Stop!
You're hurting me!

17:49.836 --> 17:51.536
Sir, I need you to calm down.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.137
- All right. Yes.
- Are you calm now?

17:53.139 --> 17:54.672
- Are you calm yet?
- Yes!

17:54.674 --> 17:55.773
Are you calm?

17:55.775 --> 17:58.509
Let me take you to the car
and I can talk in the car.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.145
Yes.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.750
It's your lucky day.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.121
She doesn't want to press
charges.

18:46.860 --> 18:48.392
I've got an ex, too.

18:50.563 --> 18:53.231
It's fucked up,
but it's reality.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.733
The bigger issue here
is you can't miss

18:55.735 --> 18:57.502
your child support payments.
It's...

18:57.504 --> 18:59.403
It's like not paying your taxes.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.472
You won't just lose visitation
with your son,

19:01.474 --> 19:03.241
you will go to jail.

19:05.411 --> 19:06.911
Trust me, somebody like you
does not want

19:06.913 --> 19:08.379
to end up in there.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.483
So what are you gonna do?

19:15.755 --> 19:17.455
I guess I don't have a choice.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.696
- Mike.
<i>- Hey, Cam. What's up?</i>

19:25.698 --> 19:29.200
Hey, so, uh, I just...

19:29.202 --> 19:30.735
How's...
How's Carol and the kids?

19:30.737 --> 19:32.436
<i>They're fine. What do you need?</i>

19:33.339 --> 19:38.342
Hey, uh, I was... I was looking
at my books, and it appears, uh,

19:39.646 --> 19:42.380
I'm probably gonna need
to borrow some money.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.714
- Um...
<i>- I thought you were doing</i>

19:43.716 --> 19:45.816
<i>- the driving thing?</i>
- Well, I am.

19:45.818 --> 19:48.819
And that's actually going
pretty good, but I just...

19:49.422 --> 19:51.556
It's been slow for, like, a week
or two, so...

19:51.558 --> 19:52.690
<i>Well, if you had a real job,</i>

19:52.691 --> 19:53.823
<i>you wouldn't have to
worry about that.</i>

19:53.826 --> 19:57.595
Look. I wouldn't be asking
if I wasn't desperate, so, um...

19:57.597 --> 19:59.564
<i>Do you even realize
what this is doing to Mom?</i>

19:59.566 --> 20:02.500
I appreciate that you
and mom talk about me and...

20:02.502 --> 20:05.403
But believe me, I am...
I'm doing great.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.438
It's just I need
just a little bit of help

20:07.440 --> 20:09.974
for just, you know,
a short time period.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.343
It's really not that big
of a deal.

20:12.345 --> 20:13.844
<i>I don't know if she said
anything to you yet,</i>

20:13.846 --> 20:16.247
<i>but she thinks you need
to be in some kind of facility.</i>

20:16.816 --> 20:19.417
Um, wow. A...

20:19.919 --> 20:22.787
facility. Okay. Um...

20:22.789 --> 20:26.691
Right now, I'm kinda focusing
on... On dealing with, uh,

20:26.693 --> 20:29.460
alimony and child support, so...

20:30.496 --> 20:34.465
I... I don't really, uh...

20:34.634 --> 20:37.735
- See a facility as an option.
<i>- Yeah, and I'm the one</i>

20:37.737 --> 20:40.018
<i>that's probably gonna end up
having to pay for it, then.</i>

20:40.840 --> 20:43.674
So... So what are you...

20:44.644 --> 20:46.544
What, you're saying you...

20:47.480 --> 20:49.380
You would only help me out
for something

20:49.382 --> 20:51.382
- that I don't really need?
<i>- You're really</i>

20:51.384 --> 20:53.251
<i>in no position to make
that judgment, are ya?</i>

20:53.253 --> 20:56.988
Look, I don't even need it
that bad, you know? It's...

20:56.990 --> 20:58.723
<i>Then why are you
calling me about it?</i>

20:58.725 --> 21:01.325
I... I have plenty of options.
You know what?

21:01.327 --> 21:02.293
I actually got to go.

21:02.294 --> 21:03.260
<i>Just don't do anything stupid.</i>

21:03.263 --> 21:04.329
Okay. Take care.

21:04.330 --> 21:05.610
<i>Cam. Wait. You need help.</i>

21:56.316 --> 21:57.381
Hi.

21:57.383 --> 22:00.451
- There you go. Thank you.
- Thank you.

24:17.190 --> 24:18.589
The fuck you waiting on?

24:19.525 --> 24:22.126
Uh, you to tell me where to go.

24:29.836 --> 24:32.837
Aw, shit. Campostella, bruh.

24:57.096 --> 24:58.162
Hey.

25:01.234 --> 25:02.533
H... How long do you
think you're gonna be?

25:02.534 --> 25:03.833
Uh, shit. Probably, like,
an hour at least.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.836
Then we're gonna make
a few more stops later on.

25:06.005 --> 25:09.173
Then we're gonna
settle up then, nigga. Shit.

25:10.576 --> 25:13.110
Uh, is, is it all right
if I pick up some fares?

25:13.980 --> 25:15.846
I mean,
if you're not gonna need me?

25:15.848 --> 25:17.915
Nah, don't go pick
nobody up from the airport

25:17.917 --> 25:20.518
and shit, bruh.
Stay your ass close.

25:21.521 --> 25:23.921
Turn that frown upside down,
nigga. You all right.

27:52.938 --> 27:56.340
If you want to see your
girlfriend again...

27:57.043 --> 27:59.677
twenty grand cash.

28:00.880 --> 28:01.945
Await...

28:04.316 --> 28:05.849
instructions.

30:03.235 --> 30:05.169
Is your mommy here?

30:40.339 --> 30:42.272
- Give it to me.
- Fine by me.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.174
I got to go home. Come on.

30:46.212 --> 30:49.379
- Fuck you.
- Come on.

30:50.216 --> 30:51.915
Don't be tellin' him

30:51.917 --> 30:53.917
- where you got this shit from.
- Are you fuc... No.

30:53.919 --> 30:56.186
I'm just trying to make sure,
okay?

30:57.356 --> 31:00.390
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
You're all right, buddy.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.459
You're all right. You're
all right. You're all right.

31:02.461 --> 31:06.530
Shh. Shh. Shh.

31:06.532 --> 31:08.365
Okay. It's okay.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.334
It's okay. You're all right.
You're all right.

31:10.336 --> 31:12.603
We're having fun. Fun, fun.

31:12.605 --> 31:13.871
Fun.

31:15.908 --> 31:20.878
Fuck. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.
Shh. Shh. Shh.

31:32.091 --> 31:33.490
You're gonna be okay, buddy.

31:34.493 --> 31:37.094
It's all good.
It's all good. Okay?

31:37.096 --> 31:39.363
Just... Just sit tight.

31:40.633 --> 31:42.566
We're... We're just... Just...

31:43.903 --> 31:47.404
I don't... I don't know
if you can hear me, but...

31:49.642 --> 31:52.175
I promise I... I... I'm...

31:52.645 --> 31:54.244
I won't hurt you.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.950
I... I have a little boy, too,

31:59.952 --> 32:02.953
and I love him very much,
just like your daddy loves you.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.455
Well, I'm...

32:07.493 --> 32:10.427
I'm doing this for him,
and, uh...

32:11.263 --> 32:14.398
Uh, I'm gonna get you
some snacks,

32:14.934 --> 32:17.968
and then we can go
to my apartment

32:17.970 --> 32:20.671
and watch some cartoons.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.580
Uh, how much is the phone?

33:06.051 --> 33:07.217
Twenty-five.

33:07.218 --> 33:08.898
You know, I'll...
I'll take the phone, too.

33:09.722 --> 33:11.388
Here we are, buddy.

33:11.557 --> 33:12.689
We made it.

33:14.727 --> 33:18.028
What... What is...

33:18.364 --> 33:19.663
Oh, my God.

33:20.466 --> 33:21.999
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

33:31.777 --> 33:35.278
She's a lying bitch.
She's a lying bitch.

33:38.617 --> 33:41.151
No, bullshit.
And she's a fuckin' liar.

33:47.393 --> 33:49.226
Ain't got nothing to do
with this.

33:49.461 --> 33:51.495
I'm paying attention,
but I didn't do nothing.

33:51.497 --> 33:52.696
She's a liar!

33:59.505 --> 34:03.774
Okay, just... Just a little...
Just a minute more, buddy,

34:04.243 --> 34:06.309
and then we'll be in there.

34:13.752 --> 34:16.253
You've got to be kidding me.

34:53.192 --> 35:00.630
Okay, buddy. Um...

35:00.632 --> 35:03.733
We're gonna play a game
that is so fun.

35:03.735 --> 35:05.168
We're, uh...

35:05.471 --> 35:06.603
It's...

35:06.605 --> 35:10.474
It's called the quiet game,
an... And... And... And... And...

35:11.610 --> 35:16.746
And if you can be quiet
until I say so...

35:18.450 --> 35:22.285
you get... You get prizes
and you get to watch

35:22.287 --> 35:25.322
as many cartoons as you want.
Okay?

35:25.324 --> 35:28.325
The game doesn't start yet.
It's later on.

35:28.594 --> 35:30.827
Okay. Here we go.

35:35.167 --> 35:36.600
Okay, bud. Here we go.

35:36.602 --> 35:38.235
The quiet game...

35:38.604 --> 35:39.669
starts...

35:40.272 --> 35:41.338
now.

35:50.549 --> 35:51.815
Yo, open the fuckin' trunk.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.216
It's stuck.

35:53.218 --> 35:54.651
- I'm sorry.
- It's stuck?

35:54.653 --> 35:56.753
- Yeah. It's not working.
- Open that shit, nigga!

35:56.755 --> 35:58.555
- I don't know...
- What the fuck is...

35:58.557 --> 36:00.390
what's going on.
It's not working.

36:03.629 --> 36:05.295
Probable cause, nigga.

36:05.297 --> 36:06.964
- You heard of that shit?
- Yeah.

36:06.965 --> 36:08.632
- Get that shit fixed.
- I will. It, uh, I...

36:08.634 --> 36:10.634
Fuck. What the fuck
is that smell?

36:11.203 --> 36:13.236
- I don't know.
- That be... It smell like fucking

36:13.238 --> 36:14.804
gasoline in here, nigga.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.440
- I just filled up.
- Just drive.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.247
Turn that fuckin' music off,
nigga.

36:24.249 --> 36:26.650
- You don't want to hear it?
- Turn it the fuck off.

36:28.387 --> 36:29.452
All right.

36:30.322 --> 36:31.521
Um...

36:31.523 --> 36:35.559
Like, it's like the trunk
is not working and...

36:35.561 --> 36:38.562
And the car's,
it's making noises.

36:38.564 --> 36:41.631
I don't know. So it's, like,
I got to take it in.

36:41.633 --> 36:44.501
Gotta take it in. You know?
I might not...

36:46.238 --> 36:47.737
Is everything okay?

36:49.274 --> 36:50.574
I don't know.

36:51.276 --> 36:52.909
That's what I'm gonna find out.

36:55.247 --> 36:58.381
Here, I'm gonna... You probably
want some air, right?

37:17.336 --> 37:18.935
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

37:20.706 --> 37:22.706
When I tell your fuckin' ass
to stay close,

37:22.708 --> 37:24.374
I mean that shit.

37:24.643 --> 37:25.875
Yeah. Yeah.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.253
We did it, buddy.

37:37.389 --> 37:38.455
We did it.

37:47.332 --> 37:49.633
- What the fuck is this shit?
- I don't know. I...

37:49.901 --> 37:51.768
- I stepped out for a bit.
- You stepped out?

37:51.770 --> 37:54.404
No, I...
Yes, when I came back...

37:56.341 --> 37:57.941
We got to call the cops.

37:58.777 --> 38:01.278
I mean, you know what kind
of person takes a kid? Hmm?

38:01.280 --> 38:02.279
Wait a minute. How...

38:02.281 --> 38:03.514
How you know he ain't just...
Just run off

38:03.515 --> 38:04.748
- or some shit?
- Oh, he didn't run off.

38:04.749 --> 38:05.982
Look at the fucking door.

38:09.421 --> 38:11.955
Oh. What the fuck is this shit?

38:16.328 --> 38:17.861
I've seen this shit.

38:18.063 --> 38:20.330
I've seen this shit
before on the news.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.499
The kids never come back.

38:22.501 --> 38:24.401
They just never come back
the same.

38:25.070 --> 38:27.570
How am I gonna look at him
in the eyes?

38:27.572 --> 38:28.972
Nah, it's not like that.

38:29.441 --> 38:30.507
What do you mean?

38:30.509 --> 38:33.310
Who took Prince?
Who took my baby?

38:36.948 --> 38:38.581
Somebody who'd want to hurt me.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.086
What are we gonna do?

38:43.789 --> 38:44.854
Huh?

38:48.093 --> 38:49.592
Put the word out...

38:50.896 --> 38:53.663
something of mine done
gone missing, and then...

38:54.900 --> 38:56.966
- shit, we wait.
- That's all you got?

38:56.968 --> 38:59.035
You're just gonna sit down
and fuckin' wait?

38:59.037 --> 39:01.638
Marina, somebody don't do
some shit like this

39:01.640 --> 39:02.872
and disappear.

39:03.008 --> 39:04.674
Now, whoever did this shit,
they...

39:04.676 --> 39:06.910
They got a fuckin' message
or some shit.

39:06.912 --> 39:08.578
They just wanna make sure
I'm listening.

39:08.980 --> 39:10.613
God damn!

39:12.951 --> 39:14.651
Oh, my God.

39:14.986 --> 39:16.453
Mazz.

39:19.958 --> 39:20.958
I need a bump.

39:25.564 --> 39:27.664
- I'm sorry, man.
- Your ass is...

39:27.666 --> 39:28.998
- Fuck!
- You're so jacked out your mind,

39:29.000 --> 39:30.400
you lost our son,
and now you want some more?

39:30.402 --> 39:31.568
I'm... Look at how...
Like you aren't?

39:31.570 --> 39:32.969
You know what, b...
I handle mine.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.070
Oh, that's right.

39:34.072 --> 39:35.589
You're a fuckin' disgrace,
you know that? You...

39:35.590 --> 39:37.107
Yeah? Fuck you! Fuck you!

39:39.077 --> 39:44.581
I'm sorry! I'm sor...
No! No! No! No!

39:44.583 --> 39:45.882
That's what you want?
You want to...

39:45.884 --> 39:47.484
- Get your ass up.
- No! No!

39:47.486 --> 39:49.452
Bump? Bump?
Here, take this shit!

39:49.454 --> 39:50.820
Take all this shit!

39:50.822 --> 39:54.457
Whatever happen to my son,
it's on you. You hear me?

39:54.459 --> 39:56.659
Say you understand me!

39:56.862 --> 39:58.862
I understand you.

39:58.864 --> 40:02.065
I'm sorry.

40:09.508 --> 40:10.673
Shit.

40:15.747 --> 40:17.013
I'm sorry.

40:18.016 --> 40:19.149
I'm sorry.

40:31.730 --> 40:33.963
I'm so sorry.

40:35.500 --> 40:37.434
I'm sorry.

40:46.711 --> 40:48.011
Uh...

40:49.514 --> 40:51.848
your ass need to roll over here
right now.

41:16.842 --> 41:18.141
Hi.

41:18.577 --> 41:20.543
- How are you?
- Uh, good, good, good.

41:20.545 --> 41:23.046

41:23.048 --> 41:25.715
- Uh...
- So you want it for hour

41:25.717 --> 41:28.618
- or for the whole night?
- Uh, a whole night, please.

41:28.620 --> 41:31.855
- I actually, uh, need two rooms.
- All right,

41:31.857 --> 41:33.623
so can I have your ID?

41:34.092 --> 41:39.095
Uh...
you know, I don't have an ID.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.698
Uh, I would need an ID for that.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.666
Well, well, yeah. I'm...

41:43.668 --> 41:46.703
What if I paid in cash?
I could pay in cash.

41:46.705 --> 41:48.972
Okay, so if you pay in cash,
I'll just need a name.

41:48.974 --> 41:50.106
- All right, go ahead.
- Okay.

41:50.108 --> 41:51.708
- Yeah.

41:57.649 --> 41:59.048
Uh, do you have cable?

42:21.206 --> 42:22.705
Okay.

42:23.074 --> 42:25.975
Okay, buddy. Here we go.
Here we go.

42:31.883 --> 42:33.883
Okay, good.

42:36.288 --> 42:38.288
You've got to be kidding me.

42:41.860 --> 42:44.027
All right.

43:08.653 --> 43:10.019
Okay.

43:50.996 --> 43:52.295
Okay.

44:27.298 --> 44:30.667
Okay, buddy.

44:30.669 --> 44:32.735
Oh, Jesus!

44:33.905 --> 44:35.872
Wake up, buddy. Wake up.

45:24.823 --> 45:26.723
You're gonna be all right.

45:27.358 --> 45:30.093
You're just sleeping, right?

45:30.095 --> 45:32.729
You just need to sleep
a little bit.

45:33.064 --> 45:36.466
You can sleep here. Okay?
In the...

45:55.887 --> 45:57.920
Police! Open up!

46:08.833 --> 46:10.500
Yo, your face, man.

46:10.502 --> 46:13.503
About your face.
Your shit went white, dog!

46:13.838 --> 46:15.371
Yo, you pick up already?

46:15.373 --> 46:17.273
No, we have some other shit

46:17.275 --> 46:20.109
Yo, I heard you roughed up them
boys real good

46:20.111 --> 46:21.511

Oh, shit.

Y'all good?

46:39.898 --> 46:44.200
Oh, we have some...

46:45.170 --> 46:46.569
You know what I'm talkin' about?

46:51.876 --> 46:55.545
Nah, man.

46:55.547 --> 46:57.580
I don't know what the fuck
you talking about.

46:57.582 --> 46:59.348
Are you sure about that?

46:59.350 --> 47:00.817
Crystal.

47:07.292 --> 47:09.225
Where the fuck is he?

47:09.360 --> 47:10.426

47:11.396 --> 47:13.196
You heard me, nigga.

47:21.039 --> 47:23.472
Better put that piece down, dog.

47:33.585 --> 47:36.352
What the fuck is wrong with you,
man? Huh?

47:36.354 --> 47:40.256
You high as a motherfucker
right now, aren't you, right?

47:40.258 --> 47:42.859
Huh?

47:45.063 --> 47:47.096
Somebody took my son, bruh.

47:48.066 --> 47:49.565
You think I did that?

47:50.568 --> 47:52.201
Shit, I don't know.

47:55.273 --> 47:57.006
All right, man. Look.

47:58.610 --> 48:00.443
Are you sure she wasn't just
too fucked up

48:00.445 --> 48:02.078

48:13.057 --> 48:16.626
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up, bruh!

48:19.964 --> 48:23.466
Sit your ass down, nigga!

48:23.468 --> 48:25.334

48:25.336 --> 48:27.904

48:29.941 --> 48:31.040
I'll sit down.

48:38.249 --> 48:40.016
Better work
on your people skills, nigga.

48:40.018 --> 48:41.651
- Shut the fuck up.
- Point that shit at me again,

48:41.653 --> 48:43.519
- see what happens.
- Shut the fuck up.

48:46.057 --> 48:47.356
I need your help.

48:47.625 --> 48:50.426
Bitch ass motherfucker.

49:32.303 --> 49:34.337
You ain't hear
what I'm saying, now.

49:35.006 --> 49:38.507
Something that belong to me
has gone missing.

49:40.178 --> 49:41.577
When the right person
hear about it,

49:41.579 --> 49:43.145
they'll know what to do.

49:45.216 --> 49:46.515
Yeah, all right, man.

49:53.257 --> 49:54.991
Ain't nobody heard shit.

49:54.993 --> 49:56.225
Fuck that.

49:56.227 --> 49:59.462
I'm gonna get the word out.
Figure this shit out for you.

50:01.199 --> 50:03.666
Hmm. You still pickin' up

50:04.402 --> 50:08.004
I know what I'm doing.
Just be ready.

50:08.406 --> 50:09.472
All right.

51:12.537 --> 51:13.836
<i>Your call has been forwarded</i>

51:13.838 --> 51:15.171

51:26.184 --> 51:27.850
<i>Your call

51:33.391 --> 51:35.458
This motherfucker.

51:36.160 --> 51:38.160
- Marina, get your shit.
- What?

51:38.162 --> 51:39.662
Get your shit together.

51:40.331 --> 51:41.697
If I get my boy

51:41.699 --> 51:43.532
we're gonna get
these motherfuckers.

51:47.805 --> 51:50.840
We're gonna go
get these motherfuckers

51:50.842 --> 51:54.577
- right here, boy.
- Damn straight.

52:26.210 --> 52:28.244
Goddamn, bae.

52:28.412 --> 52:30.379
I can hear
your fuckin' heartbeat.

52:30.381 --> 52:32.481
I'm fine. I'm fine.

52:33.885 --> 52:35.718
All right. Here he is.

52:48.432 --> 52:51.500
- Hi.
- Sunset Manor Motel.

52:51.502 --> 52:53.235
I don't...
I don't know where that...

52:53.237 --> 52:54.570
Down on 13th.

53:20.731 --> 53:22.231
Go around.

53:22.767 --> 53:23.933
All right.

53:28.306 --> 53:30.272
- Go slow.
- All right.

53:30.274 --> 53:31.674
Don't stop.

53:32.710 --> 53:34.343
- Don't stop.
- Don't stop?

53:34.345 --> 53:35.611
Don't stop.

53:46.290 --> 53:48.357
Pull up right in front
of that office.

53:50.962 --> 53:52.245
Here?

53:52.246 --> 53:53.529
Bruh, what the fuck I just say?

53:53.531 --> 53:54.930
Well, I thought you wanted...

54:01.539 --> 54:03.372
Stay your ass in the car.

54:22.693 --> 54:24.360
Can I help you?

54:24.929 --> 54:28.464
Yeah. Who in room 152?

54:28.933 --> 54:32.001
- Uh, excuse me?
- One-five-two.

54:32.003 --> 54:36.272
You got a computer back there
or records and shit here?

54:36.274 --> 54:38.540
Uh, we just have...
Have a ledger.

54:39.443 --> 54:40.609
Oh. Let me see it.

54:40.611 --> 54:42.378
It's not for customers, sir.

54:42.380 --> 54:44.446
Do I look like
a fuckin' customer to you?

54:44.682 --> 54:47.283
- I cannot give it to you.
- Oh, you can't?

54:49.320 --> 54:50.719
Hey, hey, hey. Easy, sir.

54:50.721 --> 54:52.821
Show me
the motherfuckin' book, boy.

54:54.292 --> 54:56.372
- Hold on. Hold on.
- I don't want any trouble.

55:00.498 --> 55:04.466
Greg Travis, 152 and 162?

55:04.468 --> 55:06.435
Yeah, he took two rooms.

55:11.475 --> 55:12.841
Uh-huh.

55:14.679 --> 55:16.612
Thanks, motherfucker.

55:26.791 --> 55:28.557
Mazz, what the fuck!

55:30.795 --> 55:34.596
Hello? What the fuck! Mazz!

55:35.433 --> 55:37.333
What the fuck did they say?

55:37.335 --> 55:39.868
Put the fucking gun away!
They're gonna call the cops!

55:43.708 --> 55:46.108
Hide that fucking shit,
<i>por favor!</i>

55:46.110 --> 55:48.610
What? Is he here?

55:49.547 --> 55:52.548
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

55:58.556 --> 55:59.788
Kick the door.

56:01.392 --> 56:02.591
Mazz.

56:03.661 --> 56:06.528
Mazz.
Just kick the fucking door.

56:08.132 --> 56:10.999
- What?
- He ain't in there.

56:11.001 --> 56:12.568
It's just a drop.

56:15.373 --> 56:20.509
Mazz... What... No, no. Fuck!

56:21.011 --> 56:22.111
Mazz?

56:22.113 --> 56:23.846
- Wait a minute.
- Mazz?

56:24.148 --> 56:26.265
What?

56:26.266 --> 56:28.383
Mazz, why don't you
just leave the fucking money

56:28.386 --> 56:29.952
and do what he was telling you?

56:31.155 --> 56:32.621
Mazz?

56:36.460 --> 56:37.659
Shh.

56:42.166 --> 56:44.733
- Wait, wait. What, what...
- Shut the fuck up!

56:54.412 --> 56:56.879
Wha... What's going on?
What did they say?

56:56.881 --> 56:58.781
Where you at,
motherfucker? Where you at?

56:58.783 --> 57:00.516
- Prince! Baby!
- Prince!

57:00.518 --> 57:03.152
Prince?

57:10.528 --> 57:13.562
Hello? Hey. We should go, right?

57:13.898 --> 57:16.632
Oh, my God!

57:30.047 --> 57:32.047
There's people coming out!

57:32.049 --> 57:33.816
Shut the fuck up!

57:39.990 --> 57:42.658
Come on. Come on.
Come on, come on.

57:42.660 --> 57:44.560
- Come on. Come on.
- Don't touch me!

57:57.808 --> 57:59.575
Go, go.

58:06.817 --> 58:10.018
I think I deserve
to know what's going on.

58:17.795 --> 58:19.828
Somebody took something from me.

58:21.499 --> 58:24.566
- Money?
- No, bruh.

58:24.568 --> 58:26.835
Like what? What? Drugs?

58:27.104 --> 58:29.004
- Our son.
- Shut up.

58:29.006 --> 58:30.706
- Why don't you tell him?
- Shut up.

58:30.708 --> 58:31.941
- Shut up.
- Our son,

58:31.942 --> 58:33.175
I'm never gonna see
my baby again.

58:33.177 --> 58:34.943
- Shut up.
- You understand that?

58:34.945 --> 58:36.578
- Shut up, Marina.
- You told me

58:36.580 --> 58:38.981
that whatever happened to him
was on me.

58:38.983 --> 58:40.215
But you know what?

58:40.217 --> 58:42.584
When he turns up dead,
that's on you!

58:42.586 --> 58:44.286
Listen to me!
I'm talking to you!

58:44.288 --> 58:45.954
- Sit your ass...
- That's a fact I just told.

58:45.956 --> 58:47.689
- Get your ass off of me!
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!

58:47.691 --> 58:49.091
Marina, get your...
Back your ass up!

58:49.093 --> 58:50.659
- Tone it down!
- Shit.

58:50.661 --> 58:52.161
- What the fuck you doing?
- Jesus.

58:52.162 --> 58:53.662
- Motherfucker!
- What the fuck you doing?

58:53.664 --> 58:56.732
- Stupid ass down.
- Oh, shit! Shit!

58:58.135 --> 58:59.968
- Oh, my God.
- Shut the fuck up!

58:59.970 --> 59:01.537
Let me deal with this.

59:03.874 --> 59:06.108
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Everyone, shut up.

59:06.110 --> 59:07.943
Shit, man.

59:27.865 --> 59:29.097
Hi.

59:29.833 --> 59:31.567
License
and registration, please.

59:31.569 --> 59:33.235
Oh. Yes, sir.

59:35.806 --> 59:37.339
Where are you three
headed tonight?

59:37.341 --> 59:39.841
Oh, wherever they tell me.

59:39.843 --> 59:43.946
I'm a HAIL driver.
I get paid by the mile.

59:48.986 --> 59:51.119
You swerved
a little ways back there.

59:52.189 --> 59:54.723
Oh, yeah. My phone dropped.

59:54.725 --> 59:57.659
I, uh...
The cradle in this one's busted.

59:57.661 --> 01:00:00.329
I think it's the suction.

01:00:01.799 --> 01:00:03.732
You're not drinking
on the job, are you?

01:00:03.734 --> 01:00:04.967
No, sir.

01:00:06.337 --> 01:00:09.171
What about you two?
Been partying tonight?

01:00:09.173 --> 01:00:11.373
Actually, the HAIL philosophy

01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:14.776
is to provide rides to keep
the roads safe, so...

01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:20.949
If that thing is
broken, get a new one.

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:23.018
Yes, sir. Will do.

01:00:27.691 --> 01:00:30.125
- You have a good night.
- Thank you.

01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:47.976
Well, that wasn't that bad.

01:00:50.848 --> 01:00:52.881
So, should I, um...

01:00:54.752 --> 01:00:56.084
Should I take you guys home or...

01:00:56.086 --> 01:00:57.653
It doesn't matter.

01:00:58.956 --> 01:01:01.123
Maybe going home is a good idea.

01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:02.658
No, no.

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.661
Really? You think
we're gonna find our kid

01:01:05.663 --> 01:01:07.396
after all the shit
you just pulled?

01:01:07.398 --> 01:01:10.365
Whoever did this shit
still want they money, Marina.

01:01:10.367 --> 01:01:12.300
What, you think they changed
they fuckin' mind?

01:01:12.302 --> 01:01:14.403
I swear to God,
you done snorted away

01:01:14.405 --> 01:01:16.271
half your fuckin' brain,
for real.

01:01:16.273 --> 01:01:17.839
So what's your plan, genius?

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:19.675
You're just gonna drive around
all night?

01:01:19.677 --> 01:01:21.243
<i>- Pendejo.</i>
- Fuck that shit.

01:01:21.245 --> 01:01:23.345
That what they want me to do.

01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:25.380
Stew.

01:01:25.382 --> 01:01:29.284
Psyche my shit out
so I do whatever the fuck

01:01:29.286 --> 01:01:31.086
they want so when they call
my fuckin' ass...

01:01:31.088 --> 01:01:32.721
- Well, you have to.
- Fuck that shit.

01:01:32.723 --> 01:01:34.389
I ain't got to do shit.
You know what?

01:01:34.391 --> 01:01:38.060
You know them row houses
over on Park Place?

01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:42.764
- Uh, I think so.
- Yeah.

01:02:21.472 --> 01:02:24.239
There it is. Slow down.

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:27.776
Block that fucker in.

01:02:29.813 --> 01:02:31.847
This time stay your fuckin' ass
in the car.

01:02:46.497 --> 01:02:48.764
Dontrell!

01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:50.866
Come on, bruh.

01:02:51.969 --> 01:02:53.435
I need you real quick.

01:02:54.371 --> 01:02:55.904
Come on, now.

01:03:01.879 --> 01:03:04.279
Some shit goin' down, bruh.
I need you real quick.

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:06.314
Come on, now. Open up.

01:03:07.384 --> 01:03:09.851
Fuck.
It's 4:00 in the morning, bro.

01:03:11.088 --> 01:03:12.854
- Ask me why the fuck I'm here!
- I don't...

01:03:12.856 --> 01:03:14.289
I told you everything,
Mazz, I swear.

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:15.524
- Don't fuck around.
- I swear. I swear!

01:03:15.526 --> 01:03:16.925
- Don't fuck around.
- I'm not! I'm not.

01:03:16.927 --> 01:03:18.193
I'm not. I'm not.
I swear. I swear!

01:03:18.195 --> 01:03:20.962
I don't know shit.
I'm not. I'm not.

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:22.264
- I'm not. I'm not.
- Then talk.

01:03:22.266 --> 01:03:23.799
I'm not. I'm not. I'm not!

01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:25.934
- Talk right now, nigga.
- Mazz, I told you

01:03:25.936 --> 01:03:29.471
- everything out earlier today.
- There's something you know,

01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:31.807
something going on,
and your ass know exactly

01:03:31.809 --> 01:03:33.375
what's going on. Talk.

01:03:33.377 --> 01:03:35.510
I don't know
what you want from me.

01:03:35.512 --> 01:03:37.012
No, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Okay, okay.

01:03:37.014 --> 01:03:38.280
Dontrell.

01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:42.517
You better tell this man
what he wants to hear,

01:03:43.821 --> 01:03:45.987
so he can get out of my house.

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:53.094
Yeah, you could talk now.

01:03:53.297 --> 01:03:55.430
Get back to your little
college boy shit.

01:03:55.432 --> 01:03:59.401
Whatever the fuck you do.
Or you could stay quiet,

01:03:59.603 --> 01:04:01.570
see what happen to you
and your granny.

01:04:01.572 --> 01:04:03.605
- Okay.
- It's your choice, nigga.

01:04:05.142 --> 01:04:07.943
I'm a tell you. You right.

01:04:07.945 --> 01:04:09.578
- Yeah.
- I'm a tell you.

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:11.379
Just don't...
Don't hurt my grandmother.

01:04:11.381 --> 01:04:13.014
- Talk, nigga.
- Okay.

01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:15.517
Your girl's been at Gumby's.

01:04:17.588 --> 01:04:19.521
And they've been running
trains on her,

01:04:20.157 --> 01:04:21.556
all of them.

01:04:27.231 --> 01:04:29.231
He's not gonna find my kid.

01:04:32.402 --> 01:04:33.468
I feel it.

01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:35.904
You don't know that. I mean...

01:04:35.906 --> 01:04:38.540
Nobody's gonna hold on
to some kid from the hood

01:04:38.542 --> 01:04:40.175
to negotiate with.

01:04:47.417 --> 01:04:48.617
Shit.

01:04:56.426 --> 01:04:57.993
Oh, my God.

01:04:58.362 --> 01:04:59.995
- Oh, my God.
- What? What?

01:04:59.997 --> 01:05:01.630
- Passengers always leave stuff.
- Oh, my God. It's you.

01:05:01.632 --> 01:05:03.365
No, no, that's ridiculous.

01:05:03.367 --> 01:05:06.434
- You have my son!
- No!

01:05:06.436 --> 01:05:08.470
All right, look. Look.

01:05:08.472 --> 01:05:10.372
- Look, look, look!
- Oh, my God.

01:05:10.374 --> 01:05:12.374
I don't want to hurt anyone.
I just...

01:05:12.376 --> 01:05:14.376
- I just want the money.
- He's gonna fucking kill you.

01:05:14.378 --> 01:05:15.977
I just want the money.
Then you'll get your son back.

01:05:15.979 --> 01:05:17.345
He's gonna fucking kill you!

01:05:17.347 --> 01:05:18.546
- Look. Look. Look.
- No,

01:05:18.548 --> 01:05:21.983
you take me to my son!
You take me to my son right now!

01:05:21.985 --> 01:05:24.252
- Oh, my...
- You say one fucking word

01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:26.254
and your son dies.
I swear to God.

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:28.356
Can you keep your mouth shut?

01:05:28.358 --> 01:05:31.226
Can you keep your fucking
mouth shut?

01:05:37.367 --> 01:05:40.035
Not a fucking hint. Nothing.

01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:43.672
Good.

01:05:45.575 --> 01:05:49.678
Everything's gonna be okay.
I just want the money.

01:05:59.022 --> 01:06:01.289
So, did you find anything out?

01:06:07.564 --> 01:06:08.663
Just drive.

01:06:37.294 --> 01:06:38.727
You got to pay up.

01:06:40.364 --> 01:06:43.698
Just go get the cash,
go back to the motel.

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:45.400
Just leave the cash there.

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:48.403
Then all of this can be over.

01:06:50.607 --> 01:06:52.674
And maybe Prince is gonna...

01:06:54.011 --> 01:06:56.144
Prince is gonna be there
waiting for us.

01:06:58.482 --> 01:07:02.650
So you just want me to
just pay up all that cash,

01:07:02.652 --> 01:07:06.154
no questions asked?
Just walk away?

01:07:06.156 --> 01:07:07.789
Yeah, because it's our son.

01:07:19.569 --> 01:07:21.202
Do you love me?

01:07:22.639 --> 01:07:24.189
What?

01:07:24.190 --> 01:07:25.870
It's a simple
fuckin' question, bae.

01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:29.411
'Cause you know love
without trust ain't shit.

01:07:30.747 --> 01:07:32.580
Even when we get Prince back.

01:07:33.517 --> 01:07:37.619
It ain't gonna be the same
if we can't trust each other.

01:07:39.056 --> 01:07:42.290
I know. You can trust me.

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:45.527
And because you can trust me
and you love me,

01:07:45.529 --> 01:07:47.462
we need to go get this cash.

01:08:08.485 --> 01:08:13.221
Say, bruh,
we gonna go get some cash.

01:08:17.828 --> 01:08:21.763
Yeah, just hit this right
up here.

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:23.098
Okay.

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:38.412
Yeah, follow that around.

01:08:46.523 --> 01:08:47.589
What?

01:08:50.861 --> 01:08:53.728
I'm just ready for all of this
to be over.

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:55.497
That's all.

01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:25.359
- Yeah, go that way.
- Where are we going?

01:09:25.362 --> 01:09:26.694
Make this left, all right?

01:09:26.696 --> 01:09:27.828
Under the bridge?

01:09:29.866 --> 01:09:31.232
Yeah.

01:09:32.736 --> 01:09:34.935
Yeah,
just follow that all around.

01:09:36.473 --> 01:09:38.640
And stop the car right here.

01:09:39.276 --> 01:09:40.341
Okay.

01:09:54.758 --> 01:09:57.258
What the fuck! What the fuck!

01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:58.927
- Get out. Get out.
- Mazz!

01:09:58.929 --> 01:10:00.562
What are you doing?

01:10:00.564 --> 01:10:03.398
- Get your ass...
- No, you motherfucker!

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.633
- No! Mazz! Mazz!
- Get up. Get up.

01:10:05.635 --> 01:10:07.268
Fucking asshole!

01:10:08.905 --> 01:10:12.373
No! Stop! Mazz!

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:14.609
- You're crazy! Mazz!
- Get your...

01:10:16.413 --> 01:10:18.479
You think I don't know
what the fuck goin' on?

01:10:19.482 --> 01:10:21.583
Is that what you think? Huh?

01:10:22.285 --> 01:10:23.285
Hmm?

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:32.510
Yeah.

01:10:32.511 --> 01:10:34.031
I don't know what's happening.

01:10:34.664 --> 01:10:36.431
Tell me you ain't fuck 'em.

01:10:36.833 --> 01:10:38.933
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:10:39.903 --> 01:10:41.336
Gumby.

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:43.805
Andre?

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:47.242
The others? Hmm?

01:10:49.446 --> 01:10:50.511
Yeah.

01:10:51.615 --> 01:10:53.281
I can explain.

01:10:53.283 --> 01:10:56.918
Tell me
you ain't fuck 'em, Marina.

01:10:57.587 --> 01:10:58.653
Tell me!

01:11:00.624 --> 01:11:04.259
Baby. Baby. Baby.

01:11:04.261 --> 01:11:05.460
I'm...

01:11:06.963 --> 01:11:10.765
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:11:11.868 --> 01:11:15.937
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

01:11:16.406 --> 01:11:17.505
Sorry?

01:11:18.275 --> 01:11:21.009
- Is that where Prince is? Hmm?
- What?

01:11:21.011 --> 01:11:22.477
With him?

01:11:22.912 --> 01:11:23.978
Hmm?

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:27.015
You ain't just been fuckin' him.
You been...

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:29.517
You been working with him
behind my back?

01:11:29.519 --> 01:11:31.286
- No! No, that's...
- To rob me?

01:11:31.288 --> 01:11:33.288
- No, it's not like that!
- Is that what it is?

01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:36.557
No, you listen to me.
Listen to me very carefully.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:38.793
He has him.

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:42.430
He has Prince.

01:11:52.309 --> 01:11:53.374
No.

01:12:21.638 --> 01:12:22.937
No!

01:12:55.638 --> 01:12:56.704
Let's go.

01:13:40.884 --> 01:13:42.617
Keep the car running.

01:14:28.465 --> 01:14:29.797
Hey, Becca.

01:14:29.799 --> 01:14:31.766
<i>Do you know what time it is?</i>

01:14:32.535 --> 01:14:35.703
Yeah, I just...
Sorry, I wanted to talk to you.

01:14:35.705 --> 01:14:39.740
- <i>Can this wait?</i>
- Please, it's important.

01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:41.976
<i>Are you drunk?</i>

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:47.882
No. I'm sorry.

01:14:48.685 --> 01:14:50.551
<i>It's your business how you act</i>

01:14:50.553 --> 01:14:53.221
<i>in the rest of your life,
Cam, but it comes to Adam...</i>

01:14:53.223 --> 01:14:56.190
No. I mean about everything.
I mean, I know I've been a mess

01:14:56.192 --> 01:14:59.627
for the past couple months,
maybe years.

01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:03.030
You've been great.

01:15:04.867 --> 01:15:06.701
- <i>What's going on?</i>
- Nothing. Just...

01:15:06.703 --> 01:15:08.703
- <i>What was that?</i>
- I want you

01:15:08.705 --> 01:15:10.705
to accept my apology.
Can you just do that?

01:15:10.707 --> 01:15:12.740
<i>I can't talk about
this tonight. I got to go.</i>

01:15:12.742 --> 01:15:14.041
Becca?

01:15:29.158 --> 01:15:30.725
Where you at, Gumby?

01:15:48.778 --> 01:15:52.213
Oh, man. I thought that shit
was a raid, brah.

01:15:56.286 --> 01:15:58.586
I know you and Marina
been playin'.

01:16:00.323 --> 01:16:03.658
That's the second time you point
that gun at me today, man.

01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:09.830
How long you been playin'
in this shit, huh?

01:16:12.569 --> 01:16:17.071
How many times you just look me
in my eyes, nigga, and just...

01:16:17.574 --> 01:16:18.873
Just lie to me?

01:16:18.875 --> 01:16:22.610
Ooh. Messing with too much
of that shit, man.

01:16:22.612 --> 01:16:24.178
Fucking with your head.

01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:25.980
No, no.

01:16:26.816 --> 01:16:29.584
I know everything
about you and her.

01:16:33.356 --> 01:16:35.323
You think I would be
fuckin' around

01:16:35.325 --> 01:16:37.191
with my partner's woman, man?

01:16:41.731 --> 01:16:44.298
Dumbass motherfucker.
Who told you that bullshit?

01:16:44.834 --> 01:16:45.933
She did.

01:16:47.704 --> 01:16:48.869
Mm-hmm.

01:16:55.211 --> 01:16:57.412
Where Prince?

01:16:57.413 --> 01:16:59.614
Look, man. I don't know nothing
about your boy.

01:17:00.817 --> 01:17:02.149
What the...

01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:53.934
What the fuck
is wrong with you! I'd...

01:17:56.339 --> 01:17:57.705
Fucker!

01:17:57.707 --> 01:17:59.407
Fuck with me one more time, man.

01:18:03.746 --> 01:18:06.914
Get up, man. Get up, man.

01:18:07.417 --> 01:18:08.983
Yeah, man.

01:18:08.985 --> 01:18:11.252
You're gonna leave me
no choice, man.

01:18:11.254 --> 01:18:13.287
I can't let this shit slide.

01:18:13.289 --> 01:18:16.223
Don't hurt my son, nigga.
Don't do that. Don't hurt my...

01:18:16.225 --> 01:18:19.160
Are you deaf, man?
How many times I got to tell you?

01:18:19.162 --> 01:18:21.762
I didn't fuck with your kid,
you dumb motherfucker!

01:18:21.764 --> 01:18:23.898
Get that shit through your head,
man, all right?

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:26.434
- Fuck you, man!
- Fuck you!

01:18:26.936 --> 01:18:30.738
- Fuck me? Fuck me?
- You got a gun, nigga!

01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:33.040
Tell the truth!
Tell the fuckin'...

01:18:33.042 --> 01:18:34.942
Tell the truth, nigga!

01:18:34.944 --> 01:18:37.078
Truth? You want the truth?

01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:39.747
I fucked your bitch.

01:18:40.483 --> 01:18:43.117
I fuck the shit
out your bitch, man.

01:18:43.119 --> 01:18:45.853
I've been skimmin'
on the package,

01:18:45.855 --> 01:18:47.354
but I ain't never,

01:18:47.356 --> 01:18:50.124
never fucked with no little kid,
all right?

01:18:52.261 --> 01:18:54.061
You better get
that shit through...

01:19:11.848 --> 01:19:13.247
I'll get this.

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:52.453
Are you... Are you hurt?

01:19:58.528 --> 01:20:00.427
Look, should I...

01:20:01.831 --> 01:20:03.531
take you to a hospital?

01:20:06.435 --> 01:20:07.802
I'm lost.

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:15.476
Yeah. Yeah.

01:20:19.382 --> 01:20:20.514
I'm...

01:20:21.484 --> 01:20:25.419
I'm lost, too. I...

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:41.001
Before I was a driver,
I had a real job.

01:20:42.471 --> 01:20:44.305
I worked with computers.

01:20:45.575 --> 01:20:50.377
It was boring as shit,
but the pay was good.

01:20:51.848 --> 01:20:54.481
If I had stayed
on the right path and...

01:20:55.952 --> 01:21:00.955
put in more time,
it would have been sweet.

01:21:03.626 --> 01:21:07.995
I worked hard.
I kept my head down.

01:21:08.931 --> 01:21:12.600
But then, out of nowhere,
you know,

01:21:12.602 --> 01:21:17.004
after eight years, by the way,
they informed me that my...

01:21:17.273 --> 01:21:19.540
They were gonna terminate
my position.

01:21:23.312 --> 01:21:26.413
Motherfuckers get fired
from their job every day.

01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:28.616
Yeah.

01:21:30.887 --> 01:21:32.553
Well, I didn't see it that way.

01:21:33.322 --> 01:21:37.057
Next thing I knew, I was
on the roof of the building

01:21:37.059 --> 01:21:38.959
threatening to jump
if the company

01:21:38.961 --> 01:21:40.394
didn't take me back.

01:21:41.097 --> 01:21:44.431
After that, my wife, well,
we split and...

01:21:45.434 --> 01:21:47.167
now I can't see my son.

01:21:49.238 --> 01:21:50.905
His name's Adam.

01:21:52.375 --> 01:21:54.909
I wish someone would've
sat me down

01:21:55.912 --> 01:21:58.946
told me to put my ego
and all that bullshit aside.

01:22:05.521 --> 01:22:09.223
Maybe you should just go back
to the motel

01:22:09.225 --> 01:22:11.458
and drop off the money,

01:22:12.128 --> 01:22:14.528
I mean, it's your son.

01:22:18.134 --> 01:22:20.567
What's $20,000

01:22:21.103 --> 01:22:25.205
if you can get him back? Right?

01:23:03.179 --> 01:23:05.045
Who said it was 20,000?

01:23:09.185 --> 01:23:10.651
Uh...

01:23:12.121 --> 01:23:15.990
I think... I think you did.

01:23:15.992 --> 01:23:18.325
You know, I mean, yeah.

01:23:18.694 --> 01:23:23.464
Or maybe it was Marina.

01:23:23.466 --> 01:23:27.301
No. I pay attention
when people talk money.

01:23:27.536 --> 01:23:29.670
Yeah, well, you know...
Well, I mean...

01:23:32.141 --> 01:23:34.608
I mean, you've had a long,
crazy night,

01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:37.444
so I would forgive you
if you didn't remember.

01:23:37.446 --> 01:23:39.013
Don't worry about it.

01:23:41.250 --> 01:23:44.618
Gumby didn't have Prince.

01:23:45.621 --> 01:23:49.023
What the...
What the fuck was Marina

01:23:49.025 --> 01:23:51.392
- talking about when she...
- What?

01:23:52.094 --> 01:23:54.261
- "He has him."
- What are you...

01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:01.101
At the dock.
That's what she said.

01:24:01.103 --> 01:24:02.503
"He has him."

01:24:05.307 --> 01:24:08.575
I mean,
she had a gun at her head.

01:24:08.577 --> 01:24:10.711
People would say anything
if they had a gun pointed

01:24:10.713 --> 01:24:12.813
at their head. Come on. I mean,

01:24:12.815 --> 01:24:15.082
why was that guy trying
to kill you?

01:24:15.084 --> 01:24:16.917
You know what I mean?

01:24:16.918 --> 01:24:18.751
When you were in that building,
did you look around?

01:24:18.754 --> 01:24:22.656
You know what?
I bet if we go back there

01:24:22.658 --> 01:24:25.492
- we might find your son.
- No, we ain't going back.

01:24:25.494 --> 01:24:28.228
But I just, you know,
I can just turn around up here.

01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:30.464
- No, shut the fuck up.
- You know? I...

01:24:30.466 --> 01:24:32.466
- Shut the fuck up.
- I'm trying to help you.

01:24:32.468 --> 01:24:33.801
You know? It's just, like...

01:24:33.803 --> 01:24:35.436
Shut the fuck...

01:24:37.406 --> 01:24:39.640
Where's my son,
you piece of shit?

01:24:39.642 --> 01:24:42.443
- What are you doing?
- Hmm? Where is he?

01:24:42.445 --> 01:24:45.579
I'll spray your brains
all over this motherfuckin' car!

01:24:45.581 --> 01:24:48.415
- Do you want us both to die?
- I'll say this one time, boy.

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:51.418
- Do you have my son?
- I don't know. I don't know.

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:53.153
I've been good to you, nigga.

01:24:53.155 --> 01:24:54.555
I've been good to you,
motherfucker!

01:24:54.557 --> 01:24:56.457
- This how you do me?
- That guy was trying

01:24:56.459 --> 01:24:58.425
- to kill you, I...
- Keep quiet. Keep quiet, bitch.

01:24:58.427 --> 01:25:00.294
You gonna watch your own kid
die tonight.

01:25:00.296 --> 01:25:03.363
Where is my motherfuckin' son,
nigga!

01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:05.833
- Where is he?
- Sorry.

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.967
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:02.569
Yeah.

01:29:04.707 --> 01:29:10.077
I need to report a...

01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:13.547
<i>What seems to be
the problem, sir?</i>

01:29:20.989 --> 01:29:24.858
I woke up this morning,
and my car was gone.

01:29:25.828 --> 01:29:27.694
I think it was stolen.

01:29:27.696 --> 01:29:29.896
<i>Are you in immediate danger?</i>

01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:33.033
I don't think so.

01:29:33.035 --> 01:29:35.469
<i>Do you have access
to the vehicle's title</i>

01:29:35.471 --> 01:29:36.770
<i>or registration?</i>

01:29:38.841 --> 01:29:40.674
I think I can find it.

01:29:40.676 --> 01:29:42.909
<i>Why don't you gather
that information,</i>

01:29:42.911 --> 01:29:46.079
<i>and I will transfer your call
to the appropriate department.</i>

01:29:46.081 --> 01:29:47.614
Okay, thank you.
