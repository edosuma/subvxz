WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:04.138
Are you ready to laugh?
AUDIENCE:
Yeah!

00:04.172 --> 00:06.174
Great! Well,
before we get started,

00:06.207 --> 00:09.177
at least you should know
what you're laughing at.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.312
Here's what happened last week.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.314
Barney wanted
to impress his friends

00:13.347 --> 00:15.649
Jimmy and Sabrina
with a trip to Los Angeles.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.818
Do you think you could talk
to Trevor about getting
Hope an autograph?

00:17.851 --> 00:19.520
I can do better than that.
(snaps fingers)

00:19.553 --> 00:22.356
How about I call Trevor and get
you tickets to see the show?

00:22.390 --> 00:24.492
So the Chances
loaded up their truck

00:24.525 --> 00:26.760
and took a hilarious trip
to Hollywood.

00:26.794 --> 00:31.199
But when they got here,
something unexpected happened.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.101
Not again. Come on,
kid, that's your cue.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.402
Give 'em the raspberry.
Drew Barrymore

00:34.435 --> 00:36.204
could've done this drunk
at your age.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.506
And that's when
a star was born.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.740
(blows raspberries)

00:39.773 --> 00:41.375
Who just did that?

00:42.643 --> 00:44.178
(blows raspberry)

00:44.212 --> 00:46.580
I can't believe it.
Hope's gonna be a star.

00:46.614 --> 00:49.783
So now that you're
all caught up, here we go!

00:49.817 --> 00:52.353
AUDIENCE:
Oh, oh, oh!

00:52.386 --> 00:55.089
* Whoo!

00:55.123 --> 00:57.858
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh

00:57.891 --> 01:00.094
* Oh, oh, oh...

01:07.168 --> 01:09.637
Hey! Congratulations!

01:09.670 --> 01:12.273
Hope's gonna be
a star! Yay!

01:12.306 --> 01:14.242
All right, so, today
she's got hair, wardrobe,

01:14.275 --> 01:16.277
an appointment
with a personal trainer,

01:16.310 --> 01:18.279
and... the insurance company
wants her to tinkle

01:18.312 --> 01:20.181
in this for a drug test.

01:20.214 --> 01:23.284
Urine, snot-- whatever we can
squeeze out of her is all yours.

01:23.317 --> 01:26.254
(audience laughter)

01:26.287 --> 01:28.222
Why is the audience
still here?
Oh, yeah,

01:28.256 --> 01:30.391
we like to keep
'em here until
they get agitated.

01:30.424 --> 01:33.294
Then we unleash them on the
Jerry Springer stage. It's fun.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.828
Anyway, we
like to ask

01:34.862 --> 01:36.230
a member of the family
to be an extra,

01:36.264 --> 01:37.831
to help the kid actors
through the scenes.

01:37.865 --> 01:40.201
Any of you want
to be on the show?

01:40.234 --> 01:41.402
Usually we ask
the mother.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.571
Oh, her real mother's dead.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.273
AUDIENCE:
Aw...

01:45.306 --> 01:47.308
Oh, don't worry,
she was a serial killer.

01:47.341 --> 01:49.143
(loud cheering)

01:49.177 --> 01:51.745
All right, then
I guess Dad it is.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.515
Just head over to wardrobe
later and get your costume.

01:54.548 --> 01:57.318
Yay! And don't forget
to pee in the cup, okay?

01:57.351 --> 02:00.188
Any one of you can do it,
as long as you're clean.

02:02.856 --> 02:04.292
(audience cheering loudly)

02:06.394 --> 02:08.296
Hey, glad you guys could come.

02:08.329 --> 02:09.330
Uh, these are my writers.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.232
They come up
with my insults now.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.400
Not like back
in the old days

02:12.433 --> 02:15.303
when Jimmy stood between me
and this Natesville "ten."

02:16.504 --> 02:17.471
Hollywood "four."

02:17.505 --> 02:18.439
But don't worry,

02:18.472 --> 02:20.308
I'm all full of good will now.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.276
Just like your closet, Jimmy.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.178
(audience laughter)

02:24.212 --> 02:26.214
Okay, you're lucky
you're just a kid.

02:26.247 --> 02:28.249
But in four more years,

02:28.282 --> 02:29.317
you're gonna be 18,

02:29.350 --> 02:31.519
and when you blow out
those candles,

02:31.552 --> 02:33.521
you better wish
for an ass-kicking,

02:33.554 --> 02:36.224
'cause that's what
you're gonna get!

02:36.257 --> 02:39.227
(audience jeering)

02:39.260 --> 02:40.794
You don't stand a chance
against me, Jimmy.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.296
They love me--
I'm a big star

02:42.330 --> 02:44.232
that gets the Jonas Brothers'
leftovers.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.799
We're talking
about relatively hot girls

02:45.833 --> 02:49.303
that'll kiss both
American and French style.

02:49.337 --> 02:51.405
"Your nose is so big,
when you sneeze

02:51.439 --> 02:54.208
New Jersey has to evacuate
its entire coastline."

02:54.242 --> 02:55.676
(audience groaning)

02:55.709 --> 02:57.545
Come on, guys.
Too soon.

03:02.683 --> 03:03.851
Barbara June.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.653
Wh-Where do you
think you're going?

03:05.686 --> 03:07.355
Oh, I'm-I'm on my
way to the beach

03:07.388 --> 03:08.989
to get rid of
Wilfred's ashes.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.324
Oh, well,
I better come with you.

03:10.358 --> 03:11.925
You're wearing
Crip colors,

03:11.959 --> 03:13.727
and west of Lincoln
is Blood territory.

03:13.761 --> 03:16.330
It's like you totally
ignored all the advice
in the travel brochures.

03:16.364 --> 03:17.831
I'm not dumping
Wilfred's ashes in the ocean.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.867
I'm gonna throw them
in the face of that whore

03:19.900 --> 03:22.836
he cheated on me with, and hope
she chokes to death on them

03:22.870 --> 03:24.238
and burns in Hell.

03:24.272 --> 03:26.240
Oh, plus, there's
supposed to be

03:26.274 --> 03:28.008
a good taco place nearby
for after.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.243
You want to come?

03:29.277 --> 03:31.245
Well, I'm no stranger
to betrayal.

03:31.279 --> 03:34.548
Last week our strongest elf
left my online role-playing clan

03:34.582 --> 03:37.685
right before we tried to take on
the Dragon of Kjolnar.
(groans)

03:37.718 --> 03:40.254
Also, my wife
constantly cheated on me.

03:40.288 --> 03:41.555
So, you want to help me?

03:41.589 --> 03:43.857
Try and stop me.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.359
(grunts)

03:45.393 --> 03:46.894
That was a figure of speech.

03:55.303 --> 03:56.470
What are you doing?

03:56.504 --> 03:57.705
Taking pictures
of all this food.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.607
The guys back at the
pool supply store

03:59.640 --> 04:01.442
will never believe there's
a pile of free bacon

04:01.475 --> 04:02.710
as big as your head.
Ooh, wait,

04:02.743 --> 04:05.313
let me put my head
next to it for scale.

04:06.414 --> 04:08.449
(click)
Now take a fistful of bacon

04:08.482 --> 04:10.451
and stuff it in your mouth
to show that it's free.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.754
(groans)

04:13.787 --> 04:15.923
I'm out of film!
I got to get more film!
Well, I saw

04:15.956 --> 04:18.392
a drugstore on the way in here.
I'll betcha they have more film.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.394
Oh, and pick me up a toothbrush
while you're out.

04:20.428 --> 04:23.631
Maw Maw used mine last night,
and I'm not sure what for.

04:36.777 --> 04:40.414
Whoa... it's all fake!

04:40.448 --> 04:43.617
Hollywood, you keep
throwing me curveballs!

04:44.852 --> 04:46.487
Oh, my God.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.590
You're not fake at all, are you?

04:49.623 --> 04:52.626
A real Nicaraguan pink dowager.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.329
What are you doing
so far from home?

04:55.363 --> 04:57.531
And you're a mess.

04:57.565 --> 05:01.702
Nah... I'll have you
pruned up in no time.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.003
What's that?

05:03.036 --> 05:05.373
No, no. I'm from Natesville.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.007
Okay, here's the deal.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.477
When the old whore
opens the door,

05:09.510 --> 05:11.345
you step back...

05:11.379 --> 05:14.482
and I'll throw the
ashes in her face.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.486
Hello, I'm a woman.
Please don't call me "sir."

05:18.519 --> 05:21.489
I'm Barbara June Thompson.

05:21.522 --> 05:24.458
I'm going to call you
Beardface.

05:24.492 --> 05:26.560
Is your grandmother home,
Beardface?

05:26.594 --> 05:28.996
(whispers):
Barbara June!
Manners.
It's a condition,

05:29.029 --> 05:31.899
and it's a lot more common
than you might think.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.133
So are razors.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.635
We're not here for that.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.704
I'm here looking for a skank

05:36.737 --> 05:39.373
by the name
of Marienne Crabtree.

05:39.407 --> 05:41.375
Shh! Wait a second.

05:41.409 --> 05:45.579
Grandpa, why don't you
go out to the garden.

05:45.613 --> 05:46.680
Okay.

05:46.714 --> 05:47.848
(inhales)

05:47.881 --> 05:49.082
(Grandpa's gurgling groan)

05:51.452 --> 05:53.454
Look, I know why you're here.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.389
I'm sorry
if my grandmother slept

05:55.423 --> 05:57.691
with your husband or your
boyfriend or broke your heart.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.760
She was a huge whore;
we all know it.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.662
My grandfather
doesn't need to hear it.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.897
What do you mean
she was a huge whore?

06:03.931 --> 06:06.767
With today's advances in lotions
and jellies and creams,

06:06.800 --> 06:11.038
I'm sure she's still out there
trampin' up the neighborhood.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.574
Actually, she's dead.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.876
I hope that brings you
some comfort.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.613
Well, I'm sorry you
didn't get your closure,

06:19.647 --> 06:21.449
but, hey, look
at the bright side--

06:21.482 --> 06:23.517
she's dead and you
get to move on.

06:23.551 --> 06:26.019
Oh... I'm making a
move, all right--

06:26.053 --> 06:27.955
on that old geezer.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.023
She slept with my man!

06:30.057 --> 06:31.692
I'm gonna sleep
with hers!

06:31.725 --> 06:34.027
(maniacal laughing)
Oh, you're quite mad,
Barbara June.

06:34.061 --> 06:37.130
(continues
maniacal laughing)
But I can't say your laugh

06:37.164 --> 06:38.966
isn't a bit infectious.

06:38.999 --> 06:42.002
(both laughing maniacally)

06:50.077 --> 06:52.580
Hey, you!

06:52.613 --> 06:54.548
Who told you you could
mess with that bush?

06:54.582 --> 06:56.550
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to be messing...

06:56.584 --> 06:59.453
Wait a minute, why am I
apologizing to a golfer?

06:59.487 --> 07:01.455
This bush has been
severely neglected.

07:01.489 --> 07:04.925
Whoever's in charge here
should be ashamed of themselves.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.561
Well, you've got
a take-charge attitude.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.563
We need more
people like you.

07:09.597 --> 07:12.500
So, what's this bush
supposed to look like?

07:12.533 --> 07:14.234
Well, it's not really
supposed to look...

07:14.267 --> 07:15.669
I think it looks like a fat guy.

07:15.703 --> 07:17.638
(laughs)
I love fat guys!

07:17.671 --> 07:19.973
They make me laugh.
(chuckles)

07:20.007 --> 07:21.842
Until they die young.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.644
And then I'm sad.

07:23.677 --> 07:26.847
You just made me laugh and cry.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.782
You're a true artist.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.584
Well, the art's
already in there--
I just try

07:30.618 --> 07:32.653
to carve away
the rest of the bush
so you could see it.

07:32.686 --> 07:35.088
Listen, the courtyard
by the parking structure

07:35.122 --> 07:36.490
needs a makeover.

07:36.524 --> 07:38.692
You come to my office tomorrow
with a pitch--

07:38.726 --> 07:41.595
and I don't mean this whole
"fat guy" thing, I'm over that.

07:41.629 --> 07:43.664
So you want me
to "branch out"?

07:43.697 --> 07:45.866
(laughing):
That's funny!

07:45.899 --> 07:48.936
Not strong enough
to end the scene on...

07:48.969 --> 07:50.904
but funny.

07:54.207 --> 07:57.678
All right, Hope,
we need to try on some
of these clothes I got ya!

07:57.711 --> 08:00.113
Whoa-whoa-whoa, we're
working on Hope's craft.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.149
Well, that's a waste of time.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.785
Child stars go downhill
no matter how good they act.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.520
They could star
in a Spielberg movie

08:06.554 --> 08:08.522
and still end up
playing the nutty mom

08:08.556 --> 08:10.524
on some sitcom.

08:10.558 --> 08:11.659
Trust me.

08:11.692 --> 08:15.529
The real money is
in product placement.

08:15.563 --> 08:17.631
Alvin Klein?

08:17.665 --> 08:20.634
(laughs):
Dolce and Banana?

08:20.668 --> 08:22.002
Armenian Eagle?

08:22.035 --> 08:24.572
Well, they're knockoffs!
We can't put her

08:24.605 --> 08:26.039
in the big brand names yet--
she hasn't popped.

08:26.073 --> 08:28.542
Acting is about art.
It's not about
shamelessly trying

08:28.576 --> 08:30.143
to peddle a product.
Yeah?

08:30.177 --> 08:31.712
Tell that
to that Paul Newman guy.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.714
He's in every aisle
of the grocery store.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.916
I think I even use his tampons.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.919
MAN:
So, the concept is...

08:38.952 --> 08:42.322
a notorious playboy dies
and can't get into Heaven,

08:42.355 --> 08:46.694
so he's got to go back to Earth
and help couples find true love.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.863
It's called Douche Angel.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.568
No.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.006
(whispers):
I loved it.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.240
Plant Guy!

09:00.273 --> 09:02.042
You've got five minutes.

09:02.075 --> 09:05.112
Okay, uh... do you have
a cassette player?

09:05.145 --> 09:06.179
No.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.848
Oh.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.683
Okay, uh...

09:09.717 --> 09:12.352
I think the pitch'll
still work without music.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.655
Two, three, four...

09:14.688 --> 09:16.189
* Hey, two, three, four

09:16.223 --> 09:17.925
* Plants, two, three, four

09:17.958 --> 09:19.226
* Courtyard!

09:20.961 --> 09:22.596
Interesting.

09:22.630 --> 09:25.265
It's like Glee but with plants.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.567
Go on.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.370
* Two, three, four...

09:30.403 --> 09:32.773
Okay.

09:35.643 --> 09:37.745
What are you doing?

09:37.778 --> 09:39.079
We have to get Hope
into wardrobe.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.114
No. We have to get Hope
into Us magazine,

09:41.148 --> 09:42.249
and this outfit...

09:43.416 --> 09:44.752
...is gonna do it.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.153
You are gonna
get her fired

09:46.186 --> 09:47.788
trying to sneak in
your own product placement!

09:47.821 --> 09:50.390
She is an actor,
not a race car.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.193
Oh. You had to play
the race car.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.663
(laughing)

09:55.696 --> 09:57.765
I feel like an idiot
in this costume.

09:57.798 --> 10:00.801
It makes me look
like a total...
Ass?

10:00.834 --> 10:01.735
Well, technically,

10:01.769 --> 10:03.637
my character is Dr. Buttcrack,

10:03.671 --> 10:05.773
and apparently,
I got my medical degree

10:05.806 --> 10:07.741
from Fartbutt State University.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.777
Mm.
So, we ready to go?

10:09.810 --> 10:11.411
Excuse me?
I don't think

10:11.444 --> 10:13.413
that I can wear
this on TV.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.015
That's fine with me.
Anyone else want

10:15.048 --> 10:16.850
to slip into this giant ass,
get yourself on TV?

10:16.884 --> 10:18.752
I'll do it!
Oh, no-no-no-no.
I'll do it.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.420
Great, great,
'cause my buzz is

10:20.453 --> 10:22.990
wearing off and we only got
two more hours with the kid.

10:23.023 --> 10:26.727
All right, let's shoot this
steaming pile of show business!

10:30.030 --> 10:31.732
Hello, I'm a woman.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.433
Please don't... oh.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.435
I'm so sorry
to bother you again

10:35.468 --> 10:37.738
but I felt guilty all day

10:37.771 --> 10:39.439
that my friend Barbara June
came in here

10:39.472 --> 10:41.942
and dredged up the memories
of your whorish grandmother.

10:41.975 --> 10:47.380
A lovely woman such as yourself
didn't deserve that.

10:47.414 --> 10:48.816
Other than the milk company
I sued

10:48.849 --> 10:50.718
over all those bull hormones,

10:50.751 --> 10:52.853
no one's ever apologized
to me before.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.221
I'm blushing.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.825
I-It's hardly noticeable.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.793
Would you like to come in
for some tea?

10:59.827 --> 11:02.395
Oh, I'd like that very much.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.870
And with a little rain...

11:12.272 --> 11:14.875
and the warmth of the sun...

11:18.178 --> 11:22.315
...and of course,
the finest manure...

11:22.349 --> 11:23.984
Uh, we get it! We get it.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.820
You know I've heard a lot
of crappy pitches in my time,

11:26.854 --> 11:29.757
but I've never
seen anyone bring in

11:29.790 --> 11:32.159
an actual bucket of feces.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.426
(chuckling)

11:33.460 --> 11:36.063
Plant Guy, I'm disappointed...

11:37.798 --> 11:39.867
...that I have never heard

11:39.900 --> 11:42.870
a landscaping pitch
this good before!

11:42.903 --> 11:44.204
Sold!

11:46.940 --> 11:50.377
Come on, let's hear it!

11:51.812 --> 11:56.950
(kazooing song:
"Bicycle Built for Two")

11:58.318 --> 12:01.889
(kazoos harmonizing)

12:05.392 --> 12:07.027
Wow.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.262
I haven't met many
women who play.

12:09.296 --> 12:12.399
I also play the slide whistle
and the maracas.

12:12.432 --> 12:13.901
Whoa.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.903
So you manage
a grocery store?

12:15.936 --> 12:17.204
That sounds exciting.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.773
Well, what do you do?
I'm a soup taster.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.541
Oh, I have a cousin
who tasted stews.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.943
You're kidding?

12:22.976 --> 12:24.778
I would love
to get into stews.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.246
I'll send him your résumé.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.481
Thanks.

12:28.515 --> 12:31.885
(playing "Camptown Races")

12:31.919 --> 12:34.121
(kazooing continues)

12:38.859 --> 12:40.560
And here I am
in high school.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.330
Oh. Which cheerleader
were you?

12:43.363 --> 12:44.798
Oh, no, I was the mascot.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.867
The Burbank Billy Goat.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.301
I was the first student
in 20 years

12:48.335 --> 12:50.337
who didn't have to wear
the costume head.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.873
(cheering):
Push 'em back,
push 'em back, way...

12:52.906 --> 12:54.241
(baaing):
Ba-a-a-a-a-a-ack.

12:54.274 --> 12:58.979
I've always found billy goats
to have a quiet dignity.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.516
You're a beautiful man, Barney.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.989
It's been so long.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.894
(moaning)

13:13.927 --> 13:14.794
(laughter)

13:14.828 --> 13:17.164
Now, I know you look
like a big, fat butt,

13:17.197 --> 13:20.233
but are you gonna check
my reflexes or what?

13:24.872 --> 13:26.106
(groaning)

13:26.139 --> 13:28.008
(laughing)

13:28.041 --> 13:30.510
Wait, that's not
in the script.

13:30.543 --> 13:31.845
Trevor likes to riff.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.046
He's got a real
talent for rhyming.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.848
His first hip-hop album
drops next week.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.016
"Yo Grabba Ho."

13:36.049 --> 13:38.151
Cici, I heard
you were sick.

13:38.185 --> 13:40.620
Having a cold can be
hard to kick.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.489
(grunting)
(audience laughing)

13:44.024 --> 13:46.026
Cici, are you out of whack?

13:46.059 --> 13:48.996
Just take a shot
from Dr. Buttcrack.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.497
(blows raspberry)
(all oohing)

13:50.530 --> 13:52.365
That's not in
the script.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.567
Trevor doesn't like it
when other people improvise.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.403
Hope likes to riff, too.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.971
I don't think you heard me.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.941
I said, Cici,
are you out of whack?

14:00.974 --> 14:04.077
Just take a shot
from Dr. Buttcrack.

14:04.111 --> 14:06.246
(blows raspberry)
(laughing)

14:07.915 --> 14:09.416
And... cut!

14:09.449 --> 14:10.951
We're moving on.

14:10.984 --> 14:12.953
Wait. I still had
another joke.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.521
We're not gonna
beat that.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.991
Yo, yo, yo,
Zappa Do.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.160
Looks like Hope's the star,
and you're number two.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.362
(laughing, blows raspberry)

14:22.395 --> 14:23.496
(blows raspberry)

14:23.530 --> 14:27.434
(laughing)

14:32.105 --> 14:33.206
You're a great kisser.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.541
Thanks.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.445
So are you.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.615
Why don't we take
this upstairs?

14:45.252 --> 14:48.588
Well, not the hottest sex
I've ever had,

14:48.621 --> 14:49.990
but in this case,

14:50.023 --> 14:54.027
revenge is a dish
best served cold.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.996
What is she doing here?

14:56.029 --> 14:57.264
While he was
distracting you,

14:57.297 --> 15:00.200
I was having revenge sex
with your grandpa.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.103
We put his adjustable bed
into positions

15:03.136 --> 15:04.938
it never imagined.

15:04.972 --> 15:06.573
You're a monster.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.108
And you?

15:08.141 --> 15:09.642
That's what this
was all about?

15:09.676 --> 15:10.944
I have to be honest.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.645
I was supposed
to be distracting you,

15:12.679 --> 15:14.047
but somewhere
along the way,

15:14.081 --> 15:16.316
I realized for the
first time in years...

15:16.349 --> 15:19.152
I could get lucky.

15:19.186 --> 15:20.720
Is that offer
still on the table?

15:20.753 --> 15:22.722
You're both monsters.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.958
You wanted to see
my grandmother?

15:26.426 --> 15:27.660
I'll show her to you,

15:27.694 --> 15:29.596
up close.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.631
Ugh. Oh!

15:33.266 --> 15:35.668
N-No, no, no.
Ladies!

15:35.702 --> 15:37.037
Ladies, please!
Ladies, please!

15:37.070 --> 15:37.971
(gasping)

15:38.005 --> 15:40.007
(gasping):
Help!

15:40.040 --> 15:42.475
I left my inhaler
in the car!

15:42.509 --> 15:44.144
(gasping)

15:52.519 --> 15:54.321
Wow!

15:54.354 --> 15:56.456
I thought we were
gonna have to bring in

15:56.489 --> 15:59.026
some hired guns
for a major replant,

15:59.059 --> 16:01.161
but you nailed it.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.595
I wouldn't change a flower.

16:02.629 --> 16:03.663
Thank you, Mr. President.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.265
This is only the beginning.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.101
Today a courtyard;
tomorrow, a hedge maze.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.003
Thursday, I rest
because I'm human,

16:10.037 --> 16:12.272
but Friday, I'm back
fresh with big ideas.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.174
Whoa, whoa!
Slow down, Plant Guy.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.642
I love it,

16:15.675 --> 16:18.211
but I gotta make sure the
people I sell my shows to

16:18.245 --> 16:20.147
enjoy this courtyard, too.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.449
We'll see what
the focus group thinks.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.151
These are the presidents

16:24.184 --> 16:27.220
of all the
major networks.

16:27.254 --> 16:32.192
Burt, this is FOX,
CBS, NBC, ABC.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.727
Oh, and here's BET.

16:34.761 --> 16:37.264
I know. A white guy.
Go figure.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.034
So, we all think
this is perfect, right?

16:41.068 --> 16:43.203
It's really great.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.571
It taps into the
whole Zeitgeist

16:44.604 --> 16:46.173
of the modern
courtyard.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.674
I just wish it were a
little more relatable

16:47.707 --> 16:49.642
to the 18-34 demo.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.578
I was thinking
the same thing.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.080
Maybe something
gluten-free.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.582
My niece likes
gluten-free.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.650
Yo, the hedges is tight,
but to really set it off,

16:57.684 --> 17:00.187
white boy should throw some
daisies around that bitch.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.588
You heard 'em, Burt.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.223
More gluten-free,

17:03.256 --> 17:04.357
and do whatever the
hell Joe just said.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.193
I don't know how
to tell you this,

17:06.226 --> 17:08.128
but nothing they just said
makes any sense.

17:08.161 --> 17:10.197
Let me give you
a piece of advice, kid:

17:10.230 --> 17:11.764
you want to landscape
in this town,

17:11.798 --> 17:13.333
you better play the game.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.235
Look, I just want to make
something I'm proud of

17:15.268 --> 17:16.169
that I know people will like.

17:16.203 --> 17:18.438
With all this involvement
and intrusion,

17:18.471 --> 17:20.107
I don't understand
how you guys make

17:20.140 --> 17:22.109
so many fine movies
and TV shows.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.177
I-I'm going back
to Natesville.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.678
I-I don't care if living
by the processing plant

17:25.712 --> 17:27.280
shaves 20 years off my life.

17:27.314 --> 17:29.116
At least there I can make

17:29.149 --> 17:30.783
the kinds of gardens
I believe in.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.486
Which one of you
is from NBC?

17:35.422 --> 17:37.090
(loud groan)

17:37.124 --> 17:39.559
That's for canceling
My Name is Earl!"

17:40.893 --> 17:43.230
That was eight network
presidents ago!

17:43.263 --> 17:44.597
I loved it!

17:49.136 --> 17:51.104
(blows raspberry)

17:51.138 --> 17:52.205
She's the next
Meryl Streep.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.241
What does Meryl Streep have?

17:54.274 --> 17:55.208
Does she have a handbag line?

17:55.242 --> 17:56.209
A Twitter account?

17:56.243 --> 17:58.245
She's never on TV.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.180
How can you consider
yourself a celebrity

18:00.213 --> 18:02.215
if you've never been on
"Celebrity" anything?

18:02.249 --> 18:04.584
Cici, that's enough
monkeying around.

18:04.617 --> 18:07.086
It's time for me to make
my wizard sound.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.590
Yo Zappa Do!

18:12.225 --> 18:14.194
And... cut!

18:14.227 --> 18:16.095
Hold places, get
the girl out.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.602
What's going on?
Why are you taking Hope out?

18:22.635 --> 18:24.337
Oh, there's been a rewrite.
Hope's been replaced.

18:24.371 --> 18:25.638
I was gonna tell
you guys before,

18:25.672 --> 18:27.240
but I hate confrontation
when I'm sober.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.775
Is this because
Sabrina was

18:28.808 --> 18:31.144
making changes
to the script?

18:31.178 --> 18:32.279
You turned her
into a billboard.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.346
Nobody looks up
to a billboard.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.182
Okay, I know people literally
look up to billboards.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.249
You know what I meant.

18:36.283 --> 18:37.817
It wasn't either of you.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.252
Oh, I get it.

18:39.286 --> 18:41.321
It's Jimmy's fault for
sucking as an extra.

18:41.354 --> 18:44.157
I've done everything
they've asked!

18:44.191 --> 18:47.194
Uh, you guys weren't
the problem, okay?

18:47.227 --> 18:48.428
I deal with crazy actors

18:48.461 --> 18:50.697
and their crazy families
all the time.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.299
The truth is you can behave

18:52.332 --> 18:53.700
as horribly as you want
in show business.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.669
The one thing you can't do
is steal a star's thunder.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.506
I've been in this business for
eight months-- eight months--

18:59.539 --> 19:01.608
and I've given way too much
of my life away

19:01.641 --> 19:04.211
to lose my show to some
one-trick pony

19:04.244 --> 19:05.478
who still wears pull-ups.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.280
But she's such a hit
with the fans.

19:07.314 --> 19:09.516
I want her off the show, Stu.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.484
Honestly, it's like
you want me to post

19:11.518 --> 19:14.454
those pictures with you
and that Asian transvestite.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.656
Hope's already shot
half the scenes.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.291
You can't take her
out of the show now.

19:18.325 --> 19:19.959
It makes no sense.

19:19.992 --> 19:23.796
This is a show about a kid
who wears enchanted tap shoes

19:23.830 --> 19:25.232
whose gym teacher's a mermaid.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.634
We are not concerned
about logic.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.769
And action!

19:32.272 --> 19:35.708
(audience laughter)

19:46.253 --> 19:47.320
Damn.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.988
It really is funnier
with a monkey.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.323
(sighing)

19:50.357 --> 19:51.891
(blows raspberry)

19:51.924 --> 19:53.693
(laughter)

19:56.329 --> 19:57.597
I was really hoping
going to Hollywood

19:57.630 --> 19:59.666
would make our life
more exciting.

19:59.699 --> 20:03.336
I guess we're just doomed
to be boring people forever.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.671
Well, if you think about it,

20:04.704 --> 20:08.241
our lives are actually
pretty exciting.

20:08.275 --> 20:09.709
Hope was a TV star
for a day.

20:09.742 --> 20:12.879
That's true. And I refused
to compromise my art

20:12.912 --> 20:13.946
for fame and money.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.882
I'm like... like...

20:15.915 --> 20:18.385
Actually, I can't think of
anyone who's ever done that.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.953
And although I'm
not a real doctor,

20:20.987 --> 20:23.323
I did get to
play one on TV.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.425
I had revenge sex
with an old guy

20:25.458 --> 20:28.027
while Barney made out
with a bearded woman.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.297
Barbara June!

20:30.330 --> 20:32.565
I got to second base
with a bearded woman.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.301
If you're gonna tell a story,
tell it right.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.303
It was a crazy trip.

20:36.336 --> 20:38.405
Maybe our lives
really are exciting.

20:38.438 --> 20:41.774
You know, I think if someone
filmed the stuff we do,

20:41.808 --> 20:43.276
it'd be fun to watch.

20:43.310 --> 20:44.644
Yeah, I can
see that.

20:44.677 --> 20:47.046
I mean if you edited out
all the boring parts,

20:47.079 --> 20:48.748
you know, like this stuff,

20:48.781 --> 20:50.717
where we're all just sitting
around talking in the car.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.419
Hmm.

20:52.452 --> 20:55.455
Hah. Look, somebody
wrote "wash me"

20:55.488 --> 20:57.424
on that back of
that dirty car.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.659
(all chuckle)

21:01.428 --> 21:05.264
"Gas, food, lodging,
20 miles."

21:07.867 --> 21:10.337
Hmm.
Huh.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.305
That's a big cloud.

21:35.828 --> 21:38.798
Zap you later!
