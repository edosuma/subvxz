00:00.167 --> 00:03.159
Isn't the ocean beautiful
at sunset?

00:03.471 --> 00:06.099
So soft. So peaceful.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.670
Something bad
has happened to him.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.340
Is his surf ski gone?

00:14.415 --> 00:15.439
Yes. I believe it is.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.076
<i>I usually trip over it
going to the garden in the morning.</i>

00:18.152 --> 00:20.848
Magnum insists on
leaving it across...

00:20.988 --> 00:23.821
You're gonna tread water
to Alaska if you have to.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.323
I can't make it.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.131
Rick!

00:33.501 --> 00:35.025
Rick!

02:44.598 --> 02:48.125
<i>I've always felt at
home on the ocean. Even as a kid.</i>

02:49.236 --> 02:52.069
<i>Maybe that's why I spend
so much time alone on it.</i>

02:52.473 --> 02:54.236
<i>Even on the Fourth of July.</i>

02:54.708 --> 02:58.269
<i>I know, the Fourth should be spent
with your buddies, drinking beer...</i>

02:58.345 --> 03:00.438
<i>and eating hot dogs
at the ballpark...</i>

03:00.514 --> 03:03.574
<i>or hopping in a potato sack
race with your best girl...</i>

03:03.651 --> 03:06.245
<i>or barbequing in the backyard
with your folks.</i>

03:06.320 --> 03:08.185
<i>Maybe for most Americans.</i>

03:08.255 --> 03:11.520
<i>For me, the Fourth has been
a day to spend alone.</i>

03:11.592 --> 03:12.820
<i>To remember.</i>

03:12.893 --> 03:15.726
<i>So, here I was.
All alone on the ocean...</i>

03:15.796 --> 03:19.095
<i>starting my annual
Independence Day remembrance.</i>

03:19.199 --> 03:22.566
<i>At least I wouldn't get my fingers
blown off by a cherry bomb.</i>

03:36.283 --> 03:38.114
You turkeys!

03:41.388 --> 03:44.915
Great. A $120 pair of goggles.

03:45.359 --> 03:46.656
My cap.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.928
You owe me, you turkeys!

04:03.844 --> 04:06.472
<i>You could tell I had been
a long time out of Nam.</i>

04:06.547 --> 04:09.448
<i>I'd let my anger push aside
all other thoughts,</i>

04:09.516 --> 04:11.381
<i>including survival.</i>

04:11.452 --> 04:14.148
<i>My surf ski had to be
just a swell or two away.</i>

04:14.688 --> 04:17.418
<i>Only question was, which way?</i>

04:17.658 --> 04:21.219
<i>I was about three miles from
shore, an easy swim for me.</i>

04:21.295 --> 04:23.923
<i>But I was also close to
the Molokai Express...</i>

04:23.997 --> 04:27.160
<i>a high-speed current that runs
between Oahu and Molokai.</i>

04:27.301 --> 04:29.929
<i>If I got caught in it,
without a surf ski...</i>

04:30.003 --> 04:31.994
<i>my next landfall
would be Alaska...</i>

04:32.072 --> 04:33.869
<i>9,000 miles away.</i>

04:34.475 --> 04:37.535
<i>I didn't want to lose
$1,500 worth of surf ski.</i>

04:37.611 --> 04:40.944
<i>Then again, I didn't
want to lose my life, either.</i>

05:01.268 --> 05:03.930
<i>It's not the distance
one swims that's memorable...</i>

05:04.004 --> 05:05.733
<i>it's the smell of
the goose grease.</i>

05:05.806 --> 05:07.068
How disgusting.

05:07.141 --> 05:10.907
Yes, but quite necessary if one is
to survive the cold of the Channel.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.773
You swam the English Channel?

05:12.846 --> 05:16.282
Not all the way, I'm afraid.
I had to give up. Nosebleed.

05:16.350 --> 05:17.408
Poor dear.

05:17.484 --> 05:20.647
A Higgins boat picked me up
two miles off Pas de Calais.

05:21.054 --> 05:24.251
I didn't know your family
had boats. We didn't.

05:24.391 --> 05:27.019
Oh, it was called a Higgins
boat after the designer...

05:27.094 --> 05:28.561
some other chap named Higgins.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.859
I did design a boat once,
before the war.

05:30.931 --> 05:34.025
A dual-purpose vessel to ferry
people across the Channel...

05:34.101 --> 05:35.329
and fish at the same time.

05:35.402 --> 05:37.165
How positively brilliant!

05:37.237 --> 05:38.761
Yes, that's what I thought.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.137
It had a double hull
with a sieve in the bow.

05:41.208 --> 05:44.268
Not very fast, of course, but then
those were more civilized times...

05:44.344 --> 05:45.936
when speed wasn't everything.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.004
English accent] I say, old chap.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.709
Ready for
a thorough trouncing, what?

05:50.784 --> 05:52.445
And who is this
fair young maiden?

05:52.519 --> 05:53.747
Lady Di?

05:53.821 --> 05:55.516
Oh, my, no.

05:55.589 --> 05:58.456
Agatha Chumley. Goffrey
Bonner, of the Maui Polo Club.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.958
Delighted.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.054
Oh, my.

06:02.129 --> 06:03.858
Don't you think
it's rather ironic?

06:03.931 --> 06:05.091
What?

06:05.165 --> 06:07.565
Playing for an inter-island
polo championship...

06:07.634 --> 06:09.568
on the Fourth of July weekend.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.768
I don't see what the date
has anything to do with it.

06:12.840 --> 06:16.207
You wouldn't, old stick.
Ta-ta!

06:20.214 --> 06:23.911
I believe he was referring
to the American Revolution.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.315
It began on
the Fourth of-

06:25.385 --> 06:28.377
I know when the American
insurrection began.

06:29.423 --> 06:30.447
<i>The first match...</i>

06:30.524 --> 06:32.321
<i>of this Fourth of July
weekend will begin...</i>

06:32.392 --> 06:33.791
Sorry, Agatha.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.829
No, no, it's my fault.

06:35.896 --> 06:39.229
I should have realized you
understood his reference...

06:39.299 --> 06:41.665
and simply didn't want to
give him the satisfaction.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.898
Agatha, I promise you, The Prince of
Wales Sandwich Islands Polo Team...

06:44.972 --> 06:48.408
will show up these pompous
colonists this bloody weekend.

06:50.444 --> 06:53.174
In the immortal words of

I get the feeling you guys
don't like my voice.

07:39.993 --> 07:43.258
It's not your voice,
Mr. Calvin. It's the song.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.527
It's kind of, well...

07:45.599 --> 07:47.032
It's cornball.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.294
Cornball?

07:48.368 --> 07:50.802
<i>Take Me Out to</i>
<i>the Ball Game,</i> cornball?

07:50.871 --> 07:52.031
Yeah.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.164
I've been singing <i>Take Me Out
to the Ball Game...</i>

07:54.241 --> 07:55.868
since I was three.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.433
You were three?

07:57.511 --> 07:59.479
Don't get cute, Tobius.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.246
Hey, that goes for
the rest of you.

08:03.784 --> 08:06.810
Maybe if we had a little more
good old-fashioned singing...

08:06.887 --> 08:10.687
we'd get some good old-fashioned
teamwork on the ball field.

08:10.757 --> 08:12.657
Maybe even win some games.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.888
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.564
The Konakapiolani
Street Tigers...

08:18.632 --> 08:21.760
are gonna sing together
to win together.

08:23.904 --> 08:27.863
Either that, or we can
hit the practice field...

08:27.941 --> 08:30.671
instead of going to
the Islanders' baseball game.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.438
Give us a break.

Ono and mahi-mahi?
What kind of meal is that...

08:49.262 --> 08:50.729
on the Fourth of July
for the club?

08:50.797 --> 08:52.628
<i>Would you prefer opakapaka?</i>

08:52.699 --> 08:56.726
I prefer cheeseburgers and fries,
or hot dogs and onion rings, or...

08:56.803 --> 08:58.293
For dinner?

08:58.405 --> 09:01.806
<i>Wong, in America there is only
one meal on the Fourth.</i>

09:01.875 --> 09:03.968
It starts at noon
and it goes until dark.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.807
Now come up with
something American.

09:05.879 --> 09:09.212
How about sautéed frog legs
in California wine?

09:10.751 --> 09:13.015
What do you expect from
a French chef?

09:13.520 --> 09:14.817
Hey, hey!

09:14.888 --> 09:16.082
Sorry, Rickie.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.590
I guess the ocean
brings out the kid in me.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.024
I noticed.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.224
You know, my stepdaddy used
to take me fishing...

09:26.299 --> 09:28.290
in the Chesapeake for stripers.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.203
Did you ever catch any?
All the time.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.102
I caught an 18-pounder once.

09:33.173 --> 09:36.301
Oh, that's small fry compared
to what lives along this reef.

09:36.376 --> 09:39.539
Tuna, swordfish, shark...
Speedboats!

09:39.613 --> 09:40.875
Hang on!

09:41.948 --> 09:43.609
You turkeys!

09:43.884 --> 09:45.613
Look, they cut our lines.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.246
Here, see if you can get
a name or number.

09:49.322 --> 09:52.621
Idiots like that got to be
stopped before they kill somebody.

09:56.963 --> 09:59.158
<i>"Hot and..."</i>

09:59.666 --> 10:01.258
<i>Heavy.</i>

10:01.401 --> 10:04.962
<i>The name on the stern o</i> f <i>the
boat was somethin</i> g "and Heavy."

10:05.405 --> 10:09.501
<i>It wasn't much, but I was going to look
those turkeys up when I got to shore.</i>

10:10.444 --> 10:12.207
<i>If I got to shore.</i>

10:42.509 --> 10:45.000
<i>I'd been swimming steadily
for half an hour...</i>

10:45.078 --> 10:47.876
<i>and I was further from shore
than when I started.</i>

10:50.317 --> 10:52.182
<i>There was no doubt about it.</i>

10:52.252 --> 10:54.618
<i>I was in the Molokai Express...</i>

10:54.988 --> 10:56.683
<i>with no way to get off.</i>

11:29.405 --> 11:32.793
<i>After five hours, I realized
my only hope of survival...</i>

11:32.818 --> 11:36.015
<i>was to be picked up by a boat,
any boat.</i>

11:37.246 --> 11:39.714
<i>God knows there are
enough of them in the islands.</i>

11:39.782 --> 11:42.307
<i>Sailboats, fishing boats,
outriggers...</i>

11:42.618 --> 11:45.086
<i>tugs, container ships,
yachts, naval vessels...</i>

11:45.154 --> 11:46.678
<i>Coast Guard cutters.</i>

11:46.756 --> 11:48.314
<i>Coast Guard cutters.</i>

11:48.390 --> 11:50.517
<i>They'd be out
looking for me now...</i>

11:51.127 --> 11:54.426
<i>if anyone knew I was missing.
But no one would.</i>

11:55.664 --> 11:58.827
<i>No one would miss me
for at least 72 hours.</i>

11:59.268 --> 12:02.829
<i>And 72 hours is a long time
for anyone to tread water.</i>

12:02.905 --> 12:03.997
<i>Even...</i>

12:04.073 --> 12:07.839
The 1950 San Diego
water-treading champion...

12:07.910 --> 12:12.279
is just 30 seconds away
from a new world record.

12:12.348 --> 12:13.679
I wanna stop.

12:16.352 --> 12:17.683
Come on.

12:18.854 --> 12:21.516
20 seconds away from
a new record.

12:21.590 --> 12:23.114
I'm tired.

12:23.192 --> 12:26.320
You can do it, Tommy.
You can do it. Keep going.

12:26.395 --> 12:28.056
Dad, I can't do it.

12:28.130 --> 12:29.757
Just keep going.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.197
Keep going.

12:31.934 --> 12:33.959
Dad, I can't do it.

12:36.071 --> 12:39.472
Hey, you know something,
you just did.

12:48.617 --> 12:50.744
Hey, Tommy Magnum.

12:50.820 --> 12:54.688
1950 water-treading champion
hits the beach.

12:55.324 --> 12:58.589
Attaboy!
He did a good job out there.

13:00.896 --> 13:04.627
13, 14, 15. 15 minutes.

13:04.733 --> 13:07.065
I treaded water for 15 minutes.

13:07.136 --> 13:10.037
By the time I get back home,
you're gonna be strong enough...

13:10.105 --> 13:11.868
to tread water for an hour.

13:11.941 --> 13:13.203
I will.

13:13.275 --> 13:16.711
Yeah, you'll be 6 years old,
that's awfully grown-up.

13:17.179 --> 13:20.478
Dad, are you gonna be in Korea
for a whole year?

13:20.883 --> 13:24.284
Well, you don't know how long
you'll be gone in a war, Son.

13:24.353 --> 13:27.083
Don't worry.
I'll take good care of Mom.

13:27.156 --> 13:28.748
You will, huh?

13:28.824 --> 13:31.122
Yes, sir. Till you come home.

13:31.760 --> 13:35.787
You do that and I'll bring you
a watch just like mine, huh?

13:35.931 --> 13:36.955
You will?

13:37.032 --> 13:38.192
Will what?

13:38.267 --> 13:40.701
Dad's gonna bring me
a watch just like his.

13:40.769 --> 13:41.895
Just like that?

13:41.971 --> 13:43.666
Mmm-hmm.
No.

13:43.739 --> 13:47.175
First I'm gonna earn it by...
By...

13:47.243 --> 13:50.110
By breaking his own
water-treading record, right?

13:50.179 --> 13:51.203
Yes, sir.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.738
Why do I have this funny feeling
you two are hatching something?

13:54.917 --> 13:58.216
Well, maybe that's because
we are, huh?

14:08.998 --> 14:11.432
Mom sure does cry a lot lately.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.764
Guess that's 'cause
you're going to Korea, huh?

14:13.836 --> 14:16.703
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

14:16.906 --> 14:17.930
Hey.

14:18.007 --> 14:20.942
You think you can break your
record for me when I come home?

14:21.010 --> 14:22.807
Yes, sir. That's a promise.

14:22.878 --> 14:24.243
Okay.

14:24.313 --> 14:26.747
Come on, let's go
and cheer up Mom, huh?

14:31.887 --> 14:33.582
Don't cry, Mom.

14:33.656 --> 14:35.180
Come here, you.

14:36.058 --> 14:37.457
<i>Dad!</i>

14:38.460 --> 14:41.156
I just set
a new water-treading record.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.224
Six hours. Great, huh?

14:48.304 --> 14:49.430
<i>I wonder what...</i>

14:49.505 --> 14:51.769
<i>the water-treading record
really is?</i>

14:51.840 --> 14:53.671
<i>Maybe no one knows.</i>

14:53.742 --> 14:56.506
<i>Maybe it's held by some guy like
me who treaded water for days...</i>

14:56.578 --> 14:58.569
<i>and then went belly-up.</i>

14:58.647 --> 15:01.138
Stop it. Stop it.

15:01.216 --> 15:04.014
Don't even think like that.

15:04.687 --> 15:07.520
You're gonna tread water
to Alaska if you have to.

15:13.395 --> 15:16.887
<i>Planes. Not just ships,
planes could spot me.</i>

15:17.566 --> 15:19.431
<i>No. They're too high.</i>

15:19.501 --> 15:22.197
<i>They couldn't see
a 50-foot boat from up there.</i>

15:22.571 --> 15:25.665
<i>But flying low
like T.C.'s chopper.</i>

15:27.076 --> 15:29.442
<i>Maybe T.C.'s already
out looking for me.</i>

15:29.945 --> 15:32.607
<i>No, why would he?</i>

15:32.681 --> 15:34.945
<i>He knows you spend
the Fourth alone.</i>

15:35.517 --> 15:36.916
<i>He's known that since Nam.</i>

15:45.928 --> 15:49.056
You're bucking for a
Section Eight, you know that?

15:49.131 --> 15:50.860
It's the Fourth of July.

15:50.933 --> 15:53.458
The USO is planning
a big bash in Da Nang.

15:53.535 --> 15:56.470
Rick's got some nurses
lined up from the 6577th.

15:56.538 --> 15:59.530
And you're gonna spend the weekend
in the middle of the ocean...

15:59.608 --> 16:01.007
where Charlie can plink at you.

16:01.076 --> 16:03.510
Charlie doesn't
come out in the ocean.

16:03.579 --> 16:05.069
That's not the point.

16:05.147 --> 16:08.344
It's not natural to be
by yourself on the Fourth.

16:08.417 --> 16:09.884
It is for me.

16:12.488 --> 16:13.887
That's far enough.

16:13.956 --> 16:17.722
I'll get a good workout paddling to
that island about five miles back.

16:17.926 --> 16:20.918
Five miles in the open ocean...

16:21.397 --> 16:24.230
on a long board,
just a "good workout"?

16:25.367 --> 16:28.097
Look, I'm gonna camp on the island.
You can pick me up in two days.

16:28.170 --> 16:30.832
About 1400 hours.

16:31.206 --> 16:33.674
Yeah, if there's anything left
to pick up.

17:15.017 --> 17:17.917
That boy is definitely
bucking for a Section Eight.

17:17.986 --> 17:19.977
<i>What's a Section Eight?</i>

17:20.222 --> 17:22.416
What's a Section Eight,
Mr. Calvin?

17:22.891 --> 17:26.291
Oh, I was just remembering something
that happened a long time ago.

17:31.433 --> 17:33.094
That's what I'm talking about.

17:33.168 --> 17:36.934
That's teamwork.
That is teamwork.

17:39.541 --> 17:43.033
I bet they didn't learn that
singing corny songs.

17:43.112 --> 17:45.171
What was that, Tobius?

17:45.681 --> 17:49.674
I said, I bet they sing
real good songs.

17:50.085 --> 17:52.019
That's what I thought you said.

18:25.621 --> 18:26.952
<i>Goal by number three,</i>

18:27.022 --> 18:29.081
<i>Goffrey Bonner
of the Maui Polo Club.</i>

18:29.158 --> 18:30.557
Too bad, old stick.

18:30.626 --> 18:33.686
Looks like the last goal
would have tied the game, what?

18:36.064 --> 18:37.622
<i>And the final
score of the match...</i>

18:37.699 --> 18:40.691
<i>- 5,
- 3.</i>

18:44.273 --> 18:46.332
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, for those of you...</i>

18:46.408 --> 18:49.104
<i>who wish to see these two
fine teams in action again...</i>

18:49.178 --> 18:51.373
<i>please join us tomorrow
at 1:00.</i>

18:51.446 --> 18:53.641
<i>The gates will be opened
at 11:00, however...</i>

18:53.715 --> 18:58.345
<i>for those wishing to brunch and merely enjoy
the grounds prior to the match. Thank you.</i>

19:00.088 --> 19:02.556
Rotten luck, Jonathan.

19:05.460 --> 19:08.827
But I've fixed us
a nice pot of tea.

19:08.897 --> 19:12.799
Tea. You expect me to
drink tea at a time like this?

19:12.868 --> 19:17.464
Yes. A spot of tea can make the most
frightful circumstances seem brighter.

19:18.073 --> 19:20.405
Tea has held
the empire together.

19:23.045 --> 19:25.070
You're absolutely right.

19:25.147 --> 19:26.808
Of course, I am.

19:26.882 --> 19:28.713
Besides, as I see it...

19:28.784 --> 19:31.753
your strategy is being
brilliantly executed.

19:33.855 --> 19:34.913
It is?

19:34.990 --> 19:36.184
Yes.

19:36.258 --> 19:39.125
If you had to lose a game
to the colonists...

19:39.194 --> 19:42.163
better to lose it early
on the first day.

19:42.331 --> 19:44.265
Get them overconfident.

19:45.901 --> 19:47.892
That is your ploy, isn't it?

19:49.438 --> 19:50.564
Well...

19:55.077 --> 19:56.942
Agatha, you're a wonder.

19:57.312 --> 20:00.839
It's nice to know you're
beginning to realize that.

20:00.916 --> 20:03.384
You're right. I should
look on the bright side.

20:03.452 --> 20:06.717
Magnum's not here
to ogle and sneer at me.

20:10.259 --> 20:11.453
What is it?

20:13.428 --> 20:14.861
I don't know.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.932
I suddenly felt sorry
for saying that.

20:18.600 --> 20:22.001
I've certainly heard you say
worse about him.

20:23.238 --> 20:24.830
I know, but it...

20:25.474 --> 20:27.965
felt as if I'd spoken
ill of the dead.

20:29.745 --> 20:31.303
<i>Of course, it's dead.</i>

20:31.380 --> 20:33.780
It doesn't even have a head.

20:34.016 --> 20:36.007
I thought you went fishing
with your stepdad.

20:36.084 --> 20:39.485
Well, I did. But we used
lures. Not live bait.

20:39.588 --> 20:42.921
When the head's cut off,
Sandy, it's dead bait.

20:44.559 --> 20:47.687
I don't know.
Maybe we should use lures.

20:48.764 --> 20:52.200
I can't understand why we
haven't caught anything yet.

20:54.603 --> 20:56.036
I can.

20:58.407 --> 20:59.931
Oh, no.

21:11.887 --> 21:13.616
It's following us.

21:13.822 --> 21:15.619
You've seen too many movies.

21:30.939 --> 21:33.464
Oh, I don't like this, Rick.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.407
Stop playing with it.

21:35.477 --> 21:36.739
Who's playing?

21:54.930 --> 21:56.261
We lost him.

21:56.698 --> 21:59.667
That's right, sucker!
Go find something else to eat!

22:09.077 --> 22:10.567
12 hours.

22:12.047 --> 22:13.810
A new record, Dad.

22:19.955 --> 22:24.483
Hey, Dad, every second
is a new record now.

22:26.228 --> 22:29.789
See, 12 hours and 10 seconds...

22:32.167 --> 22:35.227
12 hours and 12, no, 13.

22:36.071 --> 22:37.766
A new record-

22:46.047 --> 22:47.639
<i>I could have been bumped...</i>

22:47.716 --> 22:49.308
<i>by any of 100
harmless ocean fish.</i>

22:49.384 --> 22:51.716
<i>A tuna, a yellowtail,
a mackerel.</i>

22:53.855 --> 22:55.322
<i>But I wasn't.</i>

22:57.526 --> 22:59.289
<i>I'd been nudged by a shark.</i>

23:15.459 --> 23:18.394
<i>From the distance between
his dorsal fin and his tail...</i>

23:18.462 --> 23:20.396
<i>I'd say he was no more than
8 feet long.</i>

23:20.464 --> 23:23.956
<i>Not huge as sharks go,
but big enough to ruin my day.</i>

23:24.935 --> 23:27.802
<i>I'd had one follow me once
for miles on my surf ski.</i>

23:27.872 --> 23:30.773
<i>He just hung
a few meters off my rudder.</i>

23:31.041 --> 23:34.272
<i>I know I had set a personal
speed record to shore that day.</i>

23:34.345 --> 23:36.336
<i>I'd bet I could beat it now...</i>

23:36.413 --> 23:37.971
<i>if I had my surf ski.</i>

23:40.684 --> 23:42.481
<i>Oh, God. I'm scared.</i>

23:43.921 --> 23:45.218
<i>You're scared of what?</i>

23:45.289 --> 23:46.551
Monsters.

23:47.291 --> 23:48.952
What kind of monsters?

23:49.460 --> 23:50.722
Big ones.

23:51.028 --> 23:52.188
Oh, I think I remember those.

23:52.263 --> 23:53.287
You do?

23:53.364 --> 23:56.128
Sure. They were around
when I was a kid.

23:57.201 --> 24:00.864
Let's see. There's the one with the
big eyes and teeth. That's Herman.

24:00.938 --> 24:03.463
Then there's the shaggy one.
His name's Ralph.

24:03.541 --> 24:05.202
Then, of course, Theofulous.

24:06.410 --> 24:07.707
Theofulous?
Yeah.

24:07.778 --> 24:12.442
He got that name because he is
the awfulest monster you ever saw.

24:12.983 --> 24:14.780
You're kidding, Dad.

24:14.852 --> 24:17.184
Well, maybe just a little bit.

24:17.688 --> 24:20.748
But if you give funny names
to things that scare you...

24:20.824 --> 24:22.849
then they won't be
half so scary.

24:23.527 --> 24:26.553
Now, what monster's out there?

24:29.099 --> 24:30.828
The one with big eyes and teeth.

24:30.901 --> 24:32.835
Oh, yeah, Herman.

24:33.237 --> 24:35.330
Why don't you give
Herman a call?

24:37.608 --> 24:39.473
Go on. Go on.
Come on.

24:40.411 --> 24:41.844
Hey, Herman!

24:41.912 --> 24:43.880
What do you call this game?

24:44.848 --> 24:46.475
Ring Around the Rosie?

24:48.485 --> 24:50.476
That's a girl's game, Herman.

24:52.823 --> 24:53.983
I know!

24:55.059 --> 24:56.993
I bet you'd like
hide-and-seek.

24:59.396 --> 25:00.920
It's a great game.

25:03.334 --> 25:05.632
You just close your eyes
and you count.

25:06.937 --> 25:08.336
Oh, yeah...

25:09.740 --> 25:11.674
you don't have eyelids, do you?

25:13.043 --> 25:14.032
Well...

25:16.513 --> 25:17.980
I'll tell you what.

25:19.350 --> 25:20.874
I'll close my eyes...

25:22.720 --> 25:24.347
and you go hide.

25:25.189 --> 25:26.816
What do you say?

25:28.592 --> 25:30.787
Come on, Herman.
You're being a jerk!

25:33.664 --> 25:34.892
Okay.

25:36.133 --> 25:37.623
I'm gonna figure...

25:38.602 --> 25:42.060
you really wanna play, but
you're just too shy to say so.

25:43.240 --> 25:44.264
So...

25:46.176 --> 25:49.839
I'm gonna count to 10...

25:50.814 --> 25:52.543
and when I open my eyes...

25:54.852 --> 25:56.376
you're gonna be gone.

25:59.990 --> 26:01.082
Okay?

26:02.926 --> 26:04.018
Here I go.

26:07.965 --> 26:08.989
One...

26:11.702 --> 26:12.691
two...

26:15.039 --> 26:16.028
three...

26:18.008 --> 26:19.168
four...

26:21.111 --> 26:22.237
five...

26:24.014 --> 26:25.038
six...

26:26.316 --> 26:27.442
seven...

26:29.253 --> 26:30.413
eight...

26:32.890 --> 26:33.982
nine...

26:36.727 --> 26:37.853
ten!

26:38.362 --> 26:40.193
Ready or not, here I come!

27:02.786 --> 27:03.946
Thanks, Dad.

27:07.324 --> 27:09.189
Saved you, again, did he?

27:09.259 --> 27:12.251
That's what white knights
are for, Jonathan.

27:12.996 --> 27:14.224
Yes, quite.

27:16.133 --> 27:19.296
Isn't the ocean beautiful
at sunset?

27:19.570 --> 27:22.596
So peaceful. So soft.

27:23.607 --> 27:24.733
So...

27:26.243 --> 27:27.437
romantic.

27:31.415 --> 27:32.780
Agatha, my dear.

27:35.085 --> 27:36.416
Yes, Jonathan?

27:37.788 --> 27:39.619
I know what you're thinking.

27:41.992 --> 27:43.118
You do?

27:47.264 --> 27:50.961
You're trying to capture my
queen by sacrificing your knight.

27:53.203 --> 27:55.171
Oh, Jonathan!

27:56.373 --> 27:59.536
Sometimes you're a royal ass!

28:01.011 --> 28:02.706
I need some tea.

28:08.485 --> 28:11.283
Sometimes I think I shall
never understand women.

28:35.746 --> 28:37.270
What's wrong?

28:41.051 --> 28:42.951
What's wrong?
Huh?

28:43.020 --> 28:44.920
You look kind of strange.

28:44.988 --> 28:46.148
I do? Oh.

28:46.924 --> 28:49.484
I've got a kind of a
funny feeling in my gut.

28:49.693 --> 28:51.661
I guess I ate
one hot dog too many.

28:51.728 --> 28:53.127
I know I did.

28:59.336 --> 29:00.428
Magnum.

29:06.143 --> 29:08.611
If that's Magnum,
will you introduce me?

29:08.679 --> 29:09.703
Me, too.

29:09.780 --> 29:11.475
Yeah, all right.

29:18.355 --> 29:19.515
Come on!

29:19.590 --> 29:22.559
I don't wanna
be stuck here all night.

29:23.260 --> 29:26.229
Afraid we don't have much choice.
The port engine threw a bearing.

29:26.296 --> 29:27.957
It'll take us half the night
to limp home...

29:28.031 --> 29:31.432
and I don't want to go through the
reef in the dark with one engine.

29:31.501 --> 29:33.526
You're not lying to me?

29:34.304 --> 29:35.794
Why would I do that?

29:36.373 --> 29:38.273
Spend the night out here alone?

29:38.876 --> 29:40.036
You know...

29:41.078 --> 29:43.945
Do I look like the kind of guy
that would pull something like that?

29:44.014 --> 29:45.003
Mmm-hmm.

29:47.117 --> 29:49.347
Sandy, I'll drop the anchor.

29:50.020 --> 29:51.885
We'll have
a nice bottle of wine.

29:51.955 --> 29:55.413
We'll watch the sunset and then
we'll talk about going back in, okay?

29:55.492 --> 29:56.925
What kind of wine?

29:56.994 --> 30:01.158
I've got a '61 Margaux that I've been
saving for a sunset just like this.

30:01.231 --> 30:04.359
I don't like that French
stuff. It's too heavy for me.

30:04.434 --> 30:05.731
Do you have any rosé?

30:05.802 --> 30:08.771
I love rosé on ice with
a chunk of pineapple in it.

30:09.306 --> 30:11.570
Rosé on ice
with a chunk of pineapple?

30:11.642 --> 30:12.768
Mmm-hmm.

30:14.378 --> 30:18.246
Of course. The wine locker's down in
the galley right above the counter.

30:18.649 --> 30:21.345
You get the wine
and I'll set the anchor, okay?

31:01.091 --> 31:02.388
Is the shark back?

31:02.459 --> 31:04.188
No, the shark's not back.

31:04.261 --> 31:05.990
What are you looking for?

31:06.330 --> 31:07.957
I don't know.

31:08.198 --> 31:09.495
I just don't know.

31:09.566 --> 31:12.057
Are you trying to scare me?

31:12.135 --> 31:14.831
Oh, no, no. It's nothing.
Forget it. I'm sorry.

31:15.439 --> 31:16.929
Well, I didn't know we had rosé.

31:17.007 --> 31:18.201
Oh, you didn't.

31:18.275 --> 31:20.709
I mixed a little red
with a little white.

31:20.777 --> 31:21.835
Oh-oh.

I can't make it, Dad!

33:04.413 --> 33:06.438
<i>Don't give up, Son.</i>

33:06.949 --> 33:09.349
<i>Come on, Tommy. Don't quit.</i>

33:10.619 --> 33:11.847
<i>Attaboy.</i>

33:12.621 --> 33:13.849
<i>You can swim.</i>

33:14.823 --> 33:15.881
<i>Swim!</i>

33:15.958 --> 33:17.016
I can't.

33:17.092 --> 33:18.559
<i>Yes, you can.</i>

33:21.063 --> 33:22.360
<i>Come on, Tommy.</i>

33:26.301 --> 33:27.529
<i>That's it.</i>

33:29.738 --> 33:31.137
<i>That's it!</i>

33:34.510 --> 33:36.205
<i>Now, think of something.</i>

33:36.745 --> 33:38.838
<i>Concentrate on something, Tommy.</i>

33:39.815 --> 33:41.248
<i>Concentrate!</i>

33:46.155 --> 33:48.385
<i>With this ring, I thee wed.</i>

33:48.457 --> 33:51.051
<i>Then under the eyes of God...</i>

33:51.126 --> 33:53.959
<i>and by the powers
vested in me...</i>

33:54.129 --> 33:57.394
<i>by the Holy Roman Catholic
Church...</i>

33:57.466 --> 34:01.527
<i>I pronounce you man and wife.</i>

34:30.766 --> 34:32.199
<i>And I got one more toast.</i>

34:32.266 --> 34:33.928
<i>Yes.
No.</i>

34:34.002 --> 34:35.969
<i>And this one
is going to kill you.</i>

34:45.781 --> 34:47.304
<i>Did you arrange this?</i>

34:48.050 --> 34:50.678
<i>Of course. What's a wedding
without fireworks?</i>

34:52.621 --> 34:54.248
<i>Oh, Thomas, I'm scared.</i>

34:54.723 --> 34:55.815
<i>So am I.</i>

34:56.891 --> 34:59.918
<i>At least if we both died now,
it would be okay.</i>

35:01.763 --> 35:03.025
<i>We'd die happy.</i>

35:03.532 --> 35:05.124
<i>I'd rather live happy.</i>

36:45.867 --> 36:47.698
<i>Attaboy, Son.</i>

36:47.769 --> 36:49.327
<i>It won't be long now.</i>

36:49.404 --> 36:52.032
<i>Scuttlebutt has it that the</i>
Princeton's <i>going to relieve us...</i>

36:52.107 --> 36:53.836
<i>and we'll be home by the Fourth.</i>

36:55.177 --> 36:59.443
<i>I hope so, 'cause I don't know if I can
wait till then, I miss you two so much.</i>

37:00.882 --> 37:03.043
<i>Sometimes, coming back
from a mission...</i>

37:03.118 --> 37:06.554
<i>I'm tempted to just keep flying
until I reach San Diego.</i>

37:06.822 --> 37:09.222
Don't, Dad!
You'll run out of gas!

37:09.625 --> 37:12.890
<i>Well, there's only a little tape
left, so I better sign off.</i>

37:13.395 --> 37:16.193
<i>How's that special mission
coming, Tommy? Everything okay?</i>

37:16.264 --> 37:18.459
That special mission again, huh?

37:19.434 --> 37:20.526
<i>Good.</i>

37:20.869 --> 37:22.268
<i>Well, God bless...</i>

37:23.372 --> 37:24.771
<i>and keep you both.</i>

37:25.540 --> 37:26.598
<i>I love...</i>

37:36.184 --> 37:37.674
Don't cry, Mom.

37:39.755 --> 37:41.689
Dad said he'd be home
by the Fourth.

37:41.757 --> 37:42.917
That's only-

37:42.991 --> 37:44.390
Two days.

37:46.361 --> 37:48.488
You mean, you haven't
seen him for two days?

37:48.563 --> 37:50.087
I am not his keeper.

37:51.099 --> 37:54.296
Although his quarters
do resemble a cage at the zoo.

37:56.104 --> 37:57.628
And his car is still here?

37:57.706 --> 38:00.436
Mr. Masters' Ferrari is here,
yes.

38:00.509 --> 38:02.807
As are all the estate vehicles.

38:04.813 --> 38:07.646
Now, would you please tell me
what is going on?

38:13.422 --> 38:15.219
I- I've had
this feeling that...

38:15.290 --> 38:17.554
That Magnum is
in terrible danger.

38:17.626 --> 38:18.820
Yeah. How'd you know?

38:18.894 --> 38:20.452
I've had it, too.

38:22.664 --> 38:26.532
It happened to me once before, you
know. In Pakistan, just after the war.

38:26.601 --> 38:28.501
Teddy Fabershaw and I.

38:28.570 --> 38:31.198
He was a young lieutenant
then. Good officer.

38:31.273 --> 38:34.606
But he had this uncontrollable
desire to worship lizards.

38:34.676 --> 38:37.941
Cost him his commission when he was
caught with Colonel Meecham's daughter...

38:38.013 --> 38:40.072
and an iguana behind
the regimental stables...

38:40.148 --> 38:41.672
committing what could
only be described...

38:41.750 --> 38:45.208
as the most abhorrent act of
perversion known to man or reptile.

38:45.520 --> 38:47.044
Is his surf ski gone?

38:48.090 --> 38:49.079
Yes. I believe it is.

38:49.157 --> 38:51.250
I usually trip over it going
to the garden in the morning.

38:51.326 --> 38:53.624
Magnum insists on
leaving it across...

38:56.364 --> 39:00.300
You don't think Magnum has been on
the ocean for two days on a surf ski?

39:01.737 --> 39:04.297
I hope he's on it,
'cause if he's in it-

39:04.372 --> 39:06.363
He's in big trouble.

39:06.441 --> 39:07.499
Who?

39:07.576 --> 39:10.044
Magnum. Something bad
has happened to him.

39:11.313 --> 39:13.304
I gotta go in, Sandy.
I'm sorry.

39:17.152 --> 39:19.916
I thought we couldn't go
through the reef in the dark.

39:23.725 --> 39:25.283
On one engine.

39:44.312 --> 39:46.109
<i>Engines are funny things.</i>

39:46.181 --> 39:48.342
<i>They have voices,
just like people.</i>

39:48.416 --> 39:51.078
<i>After I'd served in
a task force a month or two...</i>

39:51.153 --> 39:55.249
<i>I could identify every ship in the
dark by the sound of its engines.</i>

40:02.464 --> 40:04.898
<i>That's why, after 20 hours
in the water...</i>

40:04.966 --> 40:07.093
<i>as impossible as it seemed...</i>

40:07.169 --> 40:09.194
<i>I knew the yacht coming
towards me...</i>

40:09.271 --> 40:11.432
<i>was the</i> King Kamehameha II.

40:18.246 --> 40:19.873
I'm gonna make it, Dad!

40:21.550 --> 40:22.949
I'm gonna make it!

40:28.423 --> 40:29.754
<i>Marine operator.</i>

40:29.825 --> 40:33.386
555-2100.

40:33.461 --> 40:35.088
<i>Thank you.</i>

40:35.163 --> 40:37.688
Well, I guess it wasn't
a bearing after all.

40:56.885 --> 40:58.113
Rick!

41:01.756 --> 41:02.882
Rick!

41:04.025 --> 41:05.185
Rick!

41:05.927 --> 41:07.155
Hey!

41:07.596 --> 41:08.688
Shh.

41:09.297 --> 41:10.696
Turn the radio off.

41:10.765 --> 41:12.232
That's my favorite.

41:12.534 --> 41:14.866
I think I heard something.

41:21.209 --> 41:23.109
<i>Mr. Masters' estate.</i>

41:23.945 --> 41:25.537
Higgins.
<i>Yes, Rick.</i>

41:25.614 --> 41:27.241
Is Magnum there?

41:27.649 --> 41:28.877
Don't go!

41:31.286 --> 41:32.548
Please!

41:34.222 --> 41:37.919
I can't hang on if you go.
I can't.

41:39.995 --> 41:41.121
Please...

41:41.763 --> 41:42.889
Dad.

41:44.532 --> 41:46.227
Dad, do something.

42:02.150 --> 42:04.482
Higgins, I'm in
the Molokai Channel...

42:04.552 --> 42:06.577
16 miles off of Koko Head.

42:06.922 --> 42:09.789
<i>Bearing 051 from
the Diamond Head lighthouse.</i>

42:10.525 --> 42:12.857
We assume Magnum
went out for his usual workout...

42:12.928 --> 42:14.361
and had some sort
of an accident.

42:14.429 --> 42:17.023
He could be anywhere within
1000 square miles.

42:17.098 --> 42:19.896
We've notified the Coast Guard,
they're launching a search at dawn.

42:19.968 --> 42:22.937
Perhaps you'd best come up
channel toward the estate.

42:23.438 --> 42:24.666
No.
What?

42:24.739 --> 42:26.570
Tell Rick to stay
right where he is.

42:26.641 --> 42:28.370
For God's sake, man, why?

42:28.843 --> 42:30.435
I don't know. A hunch.

42:31.179 --> 42:33.909
Tell Rick we'll be
in the area by sun-up, in...

42:35.050 --> 42:36.312
<i>One hour.</i>

42:36.384 --> 42:39.547
<i>All I have to do is tread
water for one more hour...</i>

42:39.621 --> 42:42.112
<i>then the sun will be up
and they'll see me.</i>

42:42.390 --> 42:44.881
<i>Any 6-year-old
can tread water for an hour.</i>

42:45.627 --> 42:46.753
<i>Right, Dad?</i>

42:48.029 --> 42:49.018
Dad?

42:51.599 --> 42:53.794
<i>He'll be so proud of you, Tommy.</i>

42:55.203 --> 42:56.636
<i>How much longer?</i>

42:57.105 --> 42:59.699
<i>30 minutes!</i>
Okay, Mom.

42:59.774 --> 43:02.038
<i>I can hang on for 30 minutes.</i>

43:02.644 --> 43:04.805
<i>Just don't move, Rick.</i>

43:06.748 --> 43:08.375
<i>How much longer?</i>

43:08.984 --> 43:10.451
<i>Five minutes.</i>

43:32.607 --> 43:33.733
Dad!

43:33.808 --> 43:35.503
I'm gonna make it, Dad!

43:35.910 --> 43:38.378
<i>I'm gonna
make it! Two minutes.</i>

43:49.924 --> 43:50.948
<i>One minute!</i>

44:03.438 --> 44:05.133
There's the yacht.

44:08.276 --> 44:09.402
There he is.

44:10.745 --> 44:12.440
Undo me.

44:16.317 --> 44:17.909
<i>30 seconds!</i>

44:24.192 --> 44:25.682
Now, go, Higgins.

44:32.967 --> 44:34.525
I've got you.
No!

44:35.003 --> 44:36.061
Magnum.

44:36.137 --> 44:38.002
I gotta do it for Dad!

44:38.073 --> 44:39.700
I got 10 seconds.

44:41.309 --> 44:43.038
<i>I'm gonna make it!</i>

44:45.713 --> 44:47.010
I made it, Dad!

44:47.916 --> 44:50.043
I made it, Dad!

44:51.653 --> 44:52.779
I made it!

44:53.488 --> 44:55.456
<i>I made it, Dad.</i>

44:55.790 --> 44:57.417
<i>Why didn't you?</i>

44:57.492 --> 44:58.652
To most Americans...

44:58.726 --> 45:02.162
this Fourth of July is a day
of picnics and fireworks.

45:02.864 --> 45:05.492
Of ball games
and potato sack races...

45:06.568 --> 45:08.661
of political speeches
and parades.

45:09.370 --> 45:13.466
But to us, the friends and family
of Lieutenant Thomas Magnum Senior...

45:14.209 --> 45:17.770
this Fourth of July, 1951
will always be remembered...

45:17.846 --> 45:20.406
as the day he came home
from the sea.

45:21.716 --> 45:23.877
God bless and keep
his wife and son.

45:28.490 --> 45:29.855
Alert!

45:33.795 --> 45:34.921
Aim!

45:38.099 --> 45:39.191
Aim!

45:41.569 --> 45:42.661
Aim!
