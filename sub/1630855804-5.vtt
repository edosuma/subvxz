[Maria grunting softly in pain]

01:33.708 --> 01:35.875
[exhales sharply] I hate that smell.

01:36.500 --> 01:37.541
What is it?

01:38.125 --> 01:40.500
[Tera] It's willow bark.
To help with the pain.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.250
I've smelled it so often now,
all I associate it with is p-- Ouch!

01:44.333 --> 01:47.041
-Well, hold still.
-Are you this rough all the time?

01:47.541 --> 01:48.833
I'm not a nurse.

01:51.791 --> 01:53.208
It's deeper than I thought.

01:53.708 --> 01:55.208
[Annette exhales]

01:56.375 --> 01:58.375
[mysterious music playing]

01:59.166 --> 02:01.625
I've only tried this
a couple of times before.

02:02.125 --> 02:04.666
[reciting incantation in Creole]

02:06.333 --> 02:09.583
-Ouch!
-And it's only worked once.

02:11.708 --> 02:13.666
I can only do it on flesh wounds.

02:13.750 --> 02:15.833
I've been trying
to teach myself bones, but…

02:16.875 --> 02:19.375
It's… You're brilliant.

02:22.625 --> 02:24.625
[woman sobbing]

02:32.291 --> 02:36.791
His wife is saying
she intends to keep the head.

02:38.625 --> 02:41.500
I shudder to imagine
what she's planning to do with it.

02:41.583 --> 02:42.916
[wailing]

02:43.666 --> 02:47.333
I can't abide tears, Nikolai.
Give her my condolences, will you?

02:47.416 --> 02:51.416
Tell her it's a shame,
he will be missed, he was a loyal servant…

02:52.458 --> 02:55.541
And he has exquisite taste
for soft furnishings.

02:55.625 --> 02:56.500
[chuckles]

02:56.583 --> 03:00.958
I'll tell her I'll find the Belmont boy
and bring back his head.

03:01.500 --> 03:02.541
[Drolta chuckles]

03:02.625 --> 03:05.166
She can put it on a platter
next to the Marquis'.

03:16.708 --> 03:17.541
[Maria] Mum?

03:19.166 --> 03:20.958
Are you… crying?

03:21.458 --> 03:23.041
No, no. It's just…

03:23.125 --> 03:23.958
[inhales deeply]

03:24.541 --> 03:26.666
I always liked
that I could see it from here.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.000
Why?

03:30.125 --> 03:33.916
When I first came to Machecoul
17 years ago, I had nothing.

03:35.250 --> 03:38.000
The townspeople
were suspicious of me, a foreigner.

03:38.083 --> 03:38.916
[sighs]

03:39.000 --> 03:42.750
But I've never forgotten how much
compassion they showed me at the Abbey.

03:43.875 --> 03:46.750
It felt like a safe place. A holy place.

03:47.833 --> 03:49.583
[wood creaking]

03:49.666 --> 03:50.500
[both] Richter!

[drawer closes]

03:52.791 --> 03:53.750
[rustling]

03:55.833 --> 03:56.833
What are you doing?

03:58.125 --> 04:00.041
Tell me you're not going back
to the Abbey.

04:00.125 --> 04:01.791
I don't need you to come with me.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.250
Don't go. Please.

04:04.333 --> 04:06.375
I told Edouard I'd come back for him.

04:06.875 --> 04:10.625
Annette, now's not the time. You're upset.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.875
I'm not upset. I'm furious.

04:12.958 --> 04:15.166
I am too, but we have to wait.

04:15.250 --> 04:16.083
For what?

04:16.166 --> 04:20.208
To regroup. To devise a new plan.
For the sun to rise. For Richter.

04:20.291 --> 04:22.250
I don't have time to wait for Richter.

04:22.333 --> 04:24.833
Edouard doesn't have time, he's in chains.

04:25.416 --> 04:27.958
How can I enjoy even one night of peace
while he's not free?

04:28.041 --> 04:30.291
When he helped to free me?

04:30.375 --> 04:33.500
Olrox and Drolta
are very powerful vampires.

04:33.583 --> 04:35.500
I don't know
what they're planning in Machecoul,

04:35.583 --> 04:37.916
but if you go now, it's suicide.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.125
Richter's coming back, and when he does,

04:40.208 --> 04:42.958
we'll find out what we can about Drolta
and the night creatures.

04:43.041 --> 04:46.291
We need to understand our enemy
to defeat them and save Edouard.

04:47.208 --> 04:48.208
Together.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.666
Maria, you are in my way.

04:54.750 --> 04:55.875
I'll only move if you tell me

04:55.958 --> 04:57.958
you're not going back
to the Abbey tonight.

04:58.041 --> 04:58.875
Fine.

04:58.958 --> 05:00.083
Or the Château?

05:00.166 --> 05:01.250
Or the Château.

05:03.916 --> 05:06.000
-I won't go inside.
-Annette!

05:06.083 --> 05:07.041
You're right.

05:07.125 --> 05:09.958
We'll need to understand
our enemies to defeat them.

05:10.041 --> 05:11.625
If you're going to spy on them,

05:11.708 --> 05:14.375
be sure to keep out of sight.
If Richter was here--

05:14.458 --> 05:16.875
Do you two wait for Richter
before you do everything?

05:16.958 --> 05:18.708
He ran away.

05:18.791 --> 05:20.208
Try to forgive him.

05:20.291 --> 05:22.458
Olrox is the vampire
who killed his mother.

05:22.541 --> 05:25.875
The dragon that's haunted his nightmares
since he was a child.

05:25.958 --> 05:27.458
We all have nightmares.

05:28.166 --> 05:29.791
The first time a slave runs away,

05:29.875 --> 05:31.958
they're branded with this mark
on their shoulder.

05:32.041 --> 05:34.041
Second time, they're hamstrung.

05:34.541 --> 05:36.125
Third time, killed.

05:36.625 --> 05:40.083
When I was a girl, I was taught to be
frightened of people on our plantation

05:40.166 --> 05:41.625
with this mark on their body.

05:41.708 --> 05:42.666
Troublemakers.

05:43.166 --> 05:45.666
But after I escaped myself,
I saw them differently.

05:45.750 --> 05:49.583
The people with this mark,
they're the people who know intimately

05:49.666 --> 05:51.250
how much freedom can cost.

05:51.333 --> 05:53.250
They wear it every day.

05:53.750 --> 05:54.750
So I do too.

05:56.666 --> 05:58.041
[wind gusting]

05:58.125 --> 06:00.291
If I'd let my past terrify me,

06:00.791 --> 06:02.458
I'd never be free of it.

06:43.250 --> 06:44.500
[panting]

06:50.333 --> 06:53.208
[Drolta] Striking terror
in the hearts of children, I see.

06:54.083 --> 06:56.083
I prefer my blood blue.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.708
I'm talking about the Belmont boy.

07:00.791 --> 07:01.750
[Olrox] Oh, him.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.208
Son of an old foe.

07:04.875 --> 07:09.000
The soon-to-be-dead son of an old foe.
We're taking care of him.

07:09.666 --> 07:12.208
Maybe you do things differently
in the New World,

07:12.291 --> 07:14.458
but over here,
we don't feed off the wealthy.

07:14.541 --> 07:16.083
The locals will start to grumble.

07:16.166 --> 07:18.125
My apologies.

07:18.208 --> 07:22.208
I didn't realize how invested you are
in keeping the mortals happy.

07:22.291 --> 07:23.500
I try…

07:24.000 --> 07:27.666
in between turning milk sour
and stalking the nightmares of villagers.

07:28.458 --> 07:31.375
We're in an uneasy alliance
with the humans in this town.

07:32.125 --> 07:33.000
For now.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.250
It disgusts me too.

07:35.750 --> 07:38.250
Making deals with them,
feeding on peasants only

07:38.333 --> 07:41.333
in exchange for some influence
among the aristocracy,

07:41.416 --> 07:45.666
enduring that man in the Abbey
in exchange for his night creatures.

07:51.291 --> 07:55.333
The sun will rise soon.
Shouldn't you get back to the Château?

07:57.416 --> 07:58.958
Where are you staying?

07:59.833 --> 08:00.875
[chuckles]

08:01.458 --> 08:03.416
There's an inn on the other side.

08:03.500 --> 08:04.333
It's good.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.083
Quiet.

08:06.666 --> 08:07.875
Private?

08:07.958 --> 08:09.166
[chuckles]

08:09.250 --> 08:10.708
I like it here in town.

08:11.208 --> 08:13.333
I like to keep my ear to the ground.

08:15.500 --> 08:16.833
[Annette shuddering]

08:18.916 --> 08:20.333
[Drolta] Not long now.

08:20.416 --> 08:21.875
[Olrox] Before dawn.

08:22.875 --> 08:24.916
I can tell without ever watching.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.666
The instant the sun comes up,

08:27.750 --> 08:30.708
some quality in the air changes.

08:31.833 --> 08:33.791
[Drolta] We all feel it. It's dread.

08:34.833 --> 08:36.833
For a few hours, we're free of it.
[inhales]

08:38.250 --> 08:41.791
Imagine total freedom.
Never shrinking from light.

08:42.375 --> 08:45.750
I don't waste my time
imagining things that will never be.

08:46.291 --> 08:48.333
But it will be, Olrox.

08:48.416 --> 08:52.416
Across Europe, vampires are pledging
their allegiance to Erzsebet Bathory.

08:52.916 --> 08:54.250
Will you be next?

08:56.166 --> 08:59.041
I've never been a believer. Of any kind.

09:00.291 --> 09:02.125
Maybe I need to see to believe.

09:03.125 --> 09:04.916
I've heard she is very formidable.

09:05.416 --> 09:08.083
Formidable. Wonderful. A lioness.

09:08.875 --> 09:11.041
Evil trembles before her.

09:11.125 --> 09:12.041
In awe.

09:13.416 --> 09:16.375
We've seen empires rise and fall, Olrox.

09:16.458 --> 09:18.083
Mortals are fickle.

09:18.583 --> 09:22.083
They riot over bread,
they flit from one god to another.

09:23.125 --> 09:25.041
I was a priestess of Sekhmet,

09:25.750 --> 09:28.583
the Egyptian goddess of war and vengeance.

09:29.125 --> 09:33.041
I remember the smell of mortal bodies
on festival days.

09:33.125 --> 09:38.291
The incense, the fervor of revelers,
the feeling of touching the immortal.

09:39.333 --> 09:40.166
And now--

09:40.250 --> 09:43.500
And now those temples
are half-buried in dust.

09:44.416 --> 09:45.458
[Drolta] Precisely.

09:46.500 --> 09:47.708
Look at all this.

09:48.541 --> 09:51.041
Human lives are as long as mayflies'.

09:51.541 --> 09:54.250
Their loyalty is just as fleeting.

09:54.750 --> 09:56.666
We endure.

09:57.458 --> 10:02.291
When that Abbey and this town is in ruins,
will we still be lurking in the shadows?

10:02.875 --> 10:06.333
Looking for feeble loyalties
amongst the mortals

10:06.416 --> 10:08.375
where we hope we may find them?

10:10.833 --> 10:12.708
Let's make a new world, Olrox.

10:13.666 --> 10:16.833
You see, that's another one
I've heard before.

10:17.333 --> 10:20.458
-Then let's make it last.

Last time I saw you,
you were a flying rat.

[sighs]

11:12.458 --> 11:13.458
[growls]

11:16.083 --> 11:19.500
They presented you to me
hours after you were born.

11:19.583 --> 11:25.291
Tiny squalling thing,
ugly as a newly-hatched chick.

11:25.375 --> 11:28.125
-With a neck like a wishbone.
-[groaning]

11:28.708 --> 11:31.208

you cower before the Christian God.

Burning flesh.

12:02.541 --> 12:03.958
You should know it well.

12:06.416 --> 12:09.458
I know the sound
your mother made when she died.

12:09.958 --> 12:12.708
I know the songs
you and the other girls used to sing

12:12.791 --> 12:14.833
when you thought everyone was asleep.

12:15.416 --> 12:18.375
I know what your nightmares are made of.

in the back of your throat

12:32.500 --> 12:34.500
and forget you ever left.

12:35.041 --> 12:39.708
That's because you're not free
where it matters.

12:39.791 --> 12:41.958
You're the one
with a brand on your forehead.

12:42.041 --> 12:45.291
This is a symbol of loyalty
to my mistress.

12:45.375 --> 12:47.000
Erzsebet Bathory.

12:47.083 --> 12:51.000
You're not fit to say her name!
How long were you a slave?

Fifteen years? More?

-Born in chains, to a woman in chains.

You, your people, my property.

13:06.125 --> 13:08.208
What's that got to do with Erzsebet?

13:08.291 --> 13:11.625
[pants] She'll restore the world
to its natural order.

13:11.708 --> 13:15.291
Immortals, kings, humans,

13:15.375 --> 13:17.541
peasants, slaves.

13:18.250 --> 13:19.166
You.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.458
-How can she do that?
-[grunts]

13:21.541 --> 13:23.125
[Annette] She's just a vampire.

13:23.208 --> 13:24.250
[laughs]

13:24.333 --> 13:26.666
Erzsebet is a goddess!

13:26.750 --> 13:29.375
She drank the blood of Sekhmet.

13:29.458 --> 13:31.041
The Egyptian goddess.

13:31.125 --> 13:32.125
Yes.

13:32.208 --> 13:35.791
Sekhmet is the daughter of Ra. A lioness.

13:35.875 --> 13:38.541
Her breath is like the desert wind.

13:38.625 --> 13:43.166
We were told there would be signs.
Disorder, slave uprisings, war.

13:43.250 --> 13:46.291
We were told to view these as heralds.

13:46.375 --> 13:50.333
Erzsebet is coming,
with all of Sekhmet's power,

13:50.416 --> 13:52.958
to restore all things.

13:53.541 --> 13:54.625
What does that mean?

13:54.708 --> 13:57.166
[inhales] It means you can kill me,

13:57.250 --> 13:59.916
but Erzsebet will never be defeated.

14:00.625 --> 14:03.208
She will come with eternal night.

14:03.291 --> 14:09.833
She will destroy
everyone and everything you love.

14:09.916 --> 14:11.875
[birds singing]

14:14.125 --> 14:15.416
-[grunts]
-[sizzling]

14:16.416 --> 14:17.875
[groaning]

14:21.625 --> 14:22.750
The sun is rising.

14:24.083 --> 14:25.708
Devouring the darkness.

14:25.791 --> 14:27.791
-[bubbling]
-[screaming]

14:29.833 --> 14:31.125
It always does.

14:31.208 --> 14:32.541
[Vaublanc screaming]

14:32.625 --> 14:35.291
-[ethereal music playing]
-This is the natural order.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.416
[Vaublanc screaming]

14:44.375 --> 14:45.541
[music fades]

14:59.916 --> 15:02.250
NEITHER GOD NOR MASTER

15:02.333 --> 15:04.500
[people singing in French in distance]

15:12.000 --> 15:13.833
[child sobbing]

15:13.916 --> 15:15.208
It's not fair.

15:15.916 --> 15:19.916
Ah, sweetheart,
everyone wants to be Liberty.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.291
Or maybe she could be Equality.
Or Fraternity.

15:23.375 --> 15:27.458
You have to be a man to be Fraternity.
It means "brotherhood."

15:27.541 --> 15:30.000
[chuckles] "Sisternity," then.

15:30.083 --> 15:31.750
[footsteps approaching]

15:35.625 --> 15:37.208
[girl] Oh, suits you.

15:38.625 --> 15:39.958
Want to join us?

15:40.041 --> 15:43.583
-Your festival, or your revolution?
-[chuckles] Both.

15:44.875 --> 15:46.583
You don't need me.

15:47.083 --> 15:49.083
[young woman] We'll need
someone to fight for us.

15:49.875 --> 15:52.958
And you look
as if you have some fight in you.

16:02.250 --> 16:03.916
Maybe I'm tired of fighting.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.458
[knock at door]

16:21.583 --> 16:22.416
Emmanuel.

16:26.291 --> 16:27.416
[Abbot] Tera, please.

16:28.583 --> 16:30.125
I only came to talk.

16:31.166 --> 16:32.000
Please.

16:34.916 --> 16:36.750
We have nothing to say to you.

16:37.333 --> 16:39.000
Are you… hurt?

16:39.875 --> 16:40.875
[door closes]

16:44.041 --> 16:45.833
I've been turning it over in my mind.

16:46.833 --> 16:48.833
What I saw, and what I know about you.

16:49.333 --> 16:52.041
You told me once
that God had called your name.

16:52.625 --> 16:54.666
That he called you to fight evil.

16:54.750 --> 16:56.958
I used to believe that, yes.

16:57.041 --> 16:58.166
And now?

16:58.250 --> 17:02.791
Now, the cornerstones I built my life on
are being toppled.

17:02.875 --> 17:04.416
Maybe it's time they were toppled.

17:04.500 --> 17:09.500
Of course, that sounds romantic,
like everything you revolutionaries tout.

17:09.583 --> 17:12.000
But once you've razed
this country to the ground,

17:12.083 --> 17:14.458
I wonder who will be left to rebuild.

17:15.458 --> 17:16.666
You talk of freedom.

17:17.458 --> 17:18.791
Freedom for whom?

17:18.875 --> 17:19.916
Everybody.

17:22.125 --> 17:25.083
There's a woman in my parish, 82.

17:25.166 --> 17:27.750
She's been hobbling to communion
every day of her life,

17:27.833 --> 17:33.250
and now her grandson has forbidden it
in the name of reason.

17:33.333 --> 17:37.833
Do you think when she wakes in the night,
she'll cry "reason," "liberty,"

17:37.916 --> 17:40.041
into the dark to banish her terrors?

17:40.125 --> 17:41.875
That's just one woman.

17:41.958 --> 17:45.125
Over 200 priests were massacred in Verdun.

17:45.208 --> 17:50.083
It won't be long before priests are exiled
or put under the guillotine.

17:50.166 --> 17:54.041
There is talk of melting down church bells
to make cannonballs.

17:54.125 --> 17:56.875
The barbarians are at the gate.

17:56.958 --> 18:01.916
To them, no one will be
true enough or loyal enough.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.500
They will drench us all in blood.

18:04.583 --> 18:09.000
-Not if your night creatures do it first!
-I'm building an army.

18:09.083 --> 18:11.541
And fighting on the wrong side.

18:11.625 --> 18:12.833
With vampires.

18:12.916 --> 18:16.083
I'm making the alliances
I have to for now.

18:16.166 --> 18:17.375
And the sacrifices.

18:17.458 --> 18:20.833
The man I used to know
would stare at himself now in disgust.

18:22.250 --> 18:24.583
I've never been sinless, Tera.

18:24.666 --> 18:28.500
There's a long way between sinless
and harboring fucking night creatures.

18:28.583 --> 18:31.666
How many times
does the entire course of history

18:31.750 --> 18:35.125
come down to the choice of just one man?

18:35.208 --> 18:38.750
Constantine. Charlemagne. Me.

18:38.833 --> 18:42.583
Who knows what further abominations
this revolution will bring?

18:42.666 --> 18:47.750
If your God is as powerful as you say,
he doesn't need you to fight for him.

18:47.833 --> 18:49.708
You're not doing this
for the sake of the Church,

18:49.791 --> 18:52.416
you're doing this
for the sake of your own vanity.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.333
[Abbot sighs]

18:54.458 --> 18:57.166
I've often thought about Judas.

18:57.708 --> 18:59.708
Traitor. Turncoat.

19:00.500 --> 19:04.333
But what would have happened
if he hadn't done what he did?

19:04.875 --> 19:08.708
Was the whole world saved
because of one man's betrayal?

19:08.791 --> 19:12.750
I was a fool to trust you.
I wish I never met you.

19:13.458 --> 19:16.541
If you hadn't met me,
we wouldn't have Maria.

19:20.375 --> 19:22.208
[sad, ethereal music playing]

19:25.208 --> 19:26.916
You said my father was dead.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.583
[sighs] To protect you.

19:34.833 --> 19:35.666
[door opens]

19:36.916 --> 19:37.750
[door closes]

19:38.875 --> 19:41.583
I promise you, Tera,

19:42.750 --> 19:44.833
I will keep her safe.

19:46.791 --> 19:48.791
[indistinct conversations]

19:53.458 --> 19:54.750
How much for--

19:54.833 --> 19:57.458
[bartender] More than you've got,
it looks like.

19:58.458 --> 20:01.583
[sighs] I could pay you back
in vampire hunting.

20:02.833 --> 20:05.875
If you can pay me in dishwashing,
you'd have a deal.

20:05.958 --> 20:08.083
[people singing in French]

20:12.416 --> 20:13.250
[sighs]

20:15.875 --> 20:18.833
But the man over there says
put it on his tab.

20:33.583 --> 20:34.708
Thanks for dinner.

20:35.291 --> 20:37.916
Well, you know what they say
about a free dinner.

20:38.833 --> 20:40.750
[hesitantly] Do they say anything?

20:40.833 --> 20:45.333
They say, "Go back to where you came from
and don't expect another one."

20:47.125 --> 20:48.416
Or maybe that's just me.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.666
Look, I didn't ask for any favors.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.541
-[door slams open]
-[people gasp]

20:55.583 --> 20:58.291
Where the fuck is the old man?

20:58.375 --> 21:00.458
[tense music playing]

21:00.541 --> 21:02.125
Ah, fuck. Another one.

21:02.208 --> 21:07.666
You swore the next time you saw my face
in this village, you would kill me.

21:08.208 --> 21:11.041
Here's my face. Give it your best.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.375
[dramatic music playing]

21:24.625 --> 21:26.500
-[whip cracking]
-[vampire grunting]

21:26.583 --> 21:28.500
[exciting music playing]

21:29.750 --> 21:31.166
[both grunt]

21:31.958 --> 21:32.791
[groans]

21:44.916 --> 21:45.833
[music fades]

21:45.916 --> 21:48.541
Well, I guess this makes me
a man of my word.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.291
It's a good thing I finished that.

21:56.041 --> 21:58.833
If you can pay for your meals
in carpentry…

22:00.541 --> 22:02.500
[all cheering]

22:02.583 --> 22:04.458
[people singing in French]

22:06.625 --> 22:07.791
Give me that.

22:08.291 --> 22:10.208
You should've taken better care of it.

22:10.708 --> 22:13.833
I forgot how heavy that thing is.

22:14.791 --> 22:15.625
Too heavy.

22:16.125 --> 22:18.166
[gentle, ethereal music playing]

22:19.750 --> 22:22.000
Hey! Hey!

22:22.083 --> 22:23.166
Who are you?

22:23.250 --> 22:25.416
Aren't you supposed to be clever?

22:25.500 --> 22:26.416
What?

22:26.500 --> 22:28.291
That's what Julia always said.

22:29.041 --> 22:30.208
Who are you?

22:32.333 --> 22:33.416
[man sighs]

22:34.458 --> 22:36.166
I'm Juste.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Juste who?

22:39.000 --> 22:40.125
Juste Belmont.

22:41.375 --> 22:42.958
Your grandfather.

22:43.041 --> 22:44.041
[gasps]

22:54.416 --> 22:55.875
[ethereal music playing]
