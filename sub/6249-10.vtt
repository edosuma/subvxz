WEBVTT

00:09.133 --> 00:12.170
The GPS says it's right up here.

00:12.253 --> 00:16.326
- You don't even know how to use that thing.
- The hell I don't.

00:16.413 --> 00:18.290
We're here.

00:18.373 --> 00:21.683
We just drove an hour through the woods
to find more woods

00:21.773 --> 00:25.049
that look just like
the woods we drove through.

00:25.133 --> 00:27.886
- Eureka.
- Ew. That's mud.

00:27.973 --> 00:30.851
No. This is like, um...

00:30.933 --> 00:33.322
- It's pretty much mud.
- Smells like rotten eggs.

00:33.413 --> 00:37.486
Mm, sulphur.
Very therapeutic.

00:37.573 --> 00:40.849
And you expect me to believe
you've never been here before?

00:40.933 --> 00:45.324
A friend of mine told me about this and
swore me to secrecy. This is my first time.

00:45.413 --> 00:48.007
In mud.

00:48.093 --> 00:49.765
Come on in. It's nice.

00:49.853 --> 00:51.844
All right.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:02.733 --> 01:05.007
Mm. Something's poking me.

01:05.093 --> 01:08.847
This mud is reputed to have
amazing romantic properties.

01:09.853 --> 01:12.083
Mm. I think I got it.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.767
No, I think I'd notice if you got it.

01:20.173 --> 01:23.131
Oh, jeez.

01:23.213 --> 01:28.003
This hot spring averages 105 degrees,
but it can spike to near boiling,

01:28.093 --> 01:29.970
so we discourage bathers.

01:30.053 --> 01:34.444
Especially those who illegally drive
4x4 vehicles into a national park.

01:34.533 --> 01:38.287
- So someone was boiled to death?
- Or had a heart attack or passed out.

01:38.373 --> 01:40.284
The flesh will have to be macerated.

01:40.373 --> 01:42.682
- What's that?
- Don't ask.

01:42.773 --> 01:46.766
The flesh either has to be boiled off
or eaten by dermestid beetles.

01:46.853 --> 01:48.445
Can't you just say "cleaned"?

01:48.533 --> 01:50.842
Sulphur encrusted the bone.
See the staining?

01:50.933 --> 01:53.163
- So it's been there a long time?
- No.

01:53.253 --> 01:56.290
- Why bring it up, then?
- Signs of blunt-force trauma.

01:56.373 --> 01:59.843
-  What's that mean?
- He didn't boil to death on his own.

01:59.933 --> 02:02.288
- I'm going to need all the mud.
- Excuse me?

02:02.373 --> 02:07.447
Get a tanker truck out here and suck it up
so we can filter it at the Jeffersonian.

02:07.533 --> 02:11.321
Humerus is 36.5cm.

02:11.413 --> 02:17.329
Medium build. Late 20s, early 30s.
He's broken this bone before.

02:17.413 --> 02:20.132
- Is she serious about the mud?
- Serious as a gas attack.

02:20.213 --> 02:23.603
Heart attack, Bones.
Serious as a heart attack.

02:28.893 --> 02:32.283
Description's too general
to try a missing persons report.

02:32.373 --> 02:36.889
Triangular depression in the calvarium,
anterior longitudinal one fracture,

02:36.973 --> 02:38.804
grazed cortical bone in C1.

02:38.893 --> 02:43.444
- There's a patterned impression in the bone.
- How many times was he hit and by what?

02:43.533 --> 02:47.048
More than once by a... square pipe?
Does that exist?

02:47.133 --> 02:52.127
People hit people with anything they can
swing. He was attacked from behind?

02:52.213 --> 02:53.692
- Mm...
- What?

02:53.773 --> 02:57.925
There's a vertical impaction fracture
to his glabella and frontonasal suture.

02:58.013 --> 03:00.766
- Same weapon?
- It doesn't appear so.

03:00.853 --> 03:03.128
- I've seen this before.
- Great. Where?

03:03.213 --> 03:06.523
From sharpened stone weapons
in "Neandertal" skeletons.

03:06.613 --> 03:08.490
I'm thinking, "Not so relevant."

03:08.573 --> 03:11.883
A blow to the front of the head
would cause a severe laceration.

03:11.973 --> 03:16.603
- No bloodstains around the mud bath.
- So the body was dumped post mortem.

03:16.693 --> 03:18.206
About the Neanderthals...

03:18.293 --> 03:21.888
- "Neandertals".
- What was the context of those killings?

03:21.973 --> 03:27.923
Accepted scenarios indicate a single
individual attacked by two or more assailants.

03:28.013 --> 03:30.811
Then we're looking
for two or more murderers.

04:02.613 --> 04:05.491
- No time of death yet.
- It was definitely a murder.

04:05.573 --> 04:08.531
- Probably two assailants.
- What a shock for that couple.

04:08.613 --> 04:12.765
They slide naked into the hot mud bath,
and a skeleton pokes her in the...

04:12.853 --> 04:14.172
- Anus.
- Bones!

04:14.253 --> 04:18.644
- It's a clinical term for that part of the body.
- Dr Brennan... Agent Booth.

04:18.733 --> 04:22.885
Would it be fair to say you use work
to avoid confronting personal issues?

04:22.973 --> 04:25.328
- Because I won't talk about?
- The anus.

04:25.413 --> 04:28.928
- You like that word.
- Do you discuss anything apart from work?

04:29.013 --> 04:31.447
- It's better than talking about...
- The anus?

04:31.533 --> 04:34.730
- What is it with you two?
- Sweets is right. We talk a lot about work.

04:34.813 --> 04:37.964
- I talk about my kid.
- Almost kidnapped during a case.

04:38.053 --> 04:39.611
My father.
We talk about him.

04:39.693 --> 04:42.924
Because Agent Booth
arrested him for murder.

04:43.013 --> 04:44.890
What are you trying to get at here?

04:44.973 --> 04:49.330
Your inability to share your personal lives.
I thought that was obvious.

04:49.413 --> 04:52.371
OK, that was snotty.
I don't respond well to snotty.

04:52.453 --> 04:56.207
After a case, sometimes
we have a drink or coffee.

04:56.293 --> 04:58.090
Booth has pie.
I don't like pie.

04:58.173 --> 05:02.291
- You really should just... give it a chance.
- I find it too sweet.

05:02.373 --> 05:06.332
OK, there. We talked about pie.
Nothing to do with work.

05:06.413 --> 05:09.723
It <i>is</i> better when we discuss murder.

05:09.813 --> 05:13.931
I'd like to see you guys in a social situation
where work is a taboo subject.

05:14.013 --> 05:17.688
- You gonna send us to a restaurant?
- I'm still not having pie.

05:17.773 --> 05:20.287
An evening out with my girlfriend and me.

05:20.373 --> 05:23.888
- They need someone to buy them beer.
- You want a double date?

05:23.973 --> 05:27.045
Why don't you go on the internet
like all the rest of the kids?

05:27.133 --> 05:31.092
If it goes well I'll withdraw my concern.
Release you back into your environment.

05:31.173 --> 05:33.733
What are we, brook trout?

05:33.813 --> 05:35.724
Fine.

05:37.253 --> 05:41.644
Agent Booth? Unless you think
that's too much to prove.

05:46.253 --> 05:51.452
Fine. I'll show him I have nothing to prove.
Bring it on, Sweets.

05:54.813 --> 05:59.682
So far I have three old beer cans,
an Indian arrowhead,

05:59.773 --> 06:05.370
73 cents in change,
and a partially melted Sharpie.

06:05.453 --> 06:08.889
The victim was braised like osso bucco.
Flesh falling off the bone.

06:08.973 --> 06:11.328
Time of death between
ten days and two weeks.

06:11.413 --> 06:15.372
I found stress fractures
and degenerative changes in the facet joints.

06:15.453 --> 06:19.844
Fits with the hypertrophy of the cervical
muscles. I found microscopic tearing,

06:19.933 --> 06:23.972
but he had to sustain this position
to cause that kind of wear and tear.

06:24.053 --> 06:25.566
Death by yoga?

06:25.653 --> 06:29.407
- Is that skull ready for me?
- You can take it out of the boiler.

06:29.493 --> 06:33.611
Or you could do that for me,
because I will never, <i>ever</i> do that.

06:33.693 --> 06:38.403
There are fractures of the pelvis,
fractures of thoracic and lumbar vertebrae,

06:38.493 --> 06:41.246
multiple metacarpal
and metatarsal fractures...

06:41.333 --> 06:43.164
What was he, a crash-test dummy?

06:43.253 --> 06:45.721
The injuries to the vertebrae,
tibia and femur

06:45.813 --> 06:49.567
are consistent with landing on the feet
after falling from 10 to 20 feet.

06:49.653 --> 06:51.132
Like jumping out of a tree?

06:51.213 --> 06:54.171
The damage to the scapula and acromion
was from a low fall,

06:54.253 --> 06:57.131
but forward movement
between 16 to 20 miles per hour.

06:57.213 --> 07:00.285
- Falling off a bicycle.
- These injuries are more recent.

07:00.373 --> 07:03.763
Fractured and scored patella
and torn retinaculum.

07:03.853 --> 07:05.605
Even I didn't get that one.

07:05.693 --> 07:09.527
Why would anyone wanna kill him?
He was doing a good enough job on his own.

07:10.573 --> 07:14.452
Yes, Dr Sweets. I'll ask him.
How's Wednesday night? Are you free?

07:14.533 --> 07:17.525
To have our big double date
with our psychiatrist?

07:17.613 --> 07:20.923
One more evening, and maybe
we won't have to see him any more.

07:21.013 --> 07:24.688
Wednesday's fine. I can't wait.
Does he want me to get you a corsage?

07:24.773 --> 07:30.530
Wednesday is fine. We'll meet you there.
Yeah, I'm looking forward to meeting her.

07:30.613 --> 07:31.887
OK, bye.

07:31.973 --> 07:35.363
This might be fun.
His girlfriend works with tropical fish.

07:35.453 --> 07:36.852
- Tropical fish?
- Yeah.

07:36.933 --> 07:40.323
- This is weird. Where are we meeting?
- At their ceramics class.

07:40.413 --> 07:43.291
- What? No. You're kidding.
- Why would I be kidding?

07:43.373 --> 07:45.284
He said we need a common activity.

07:45.373 --> 07:51.084
Ceramics? I thought the point of therapy was
to give us peace of mind, not drive us crazy.

07:51.653 --> 07:53.962
Hey, it's Angela.

07:54.053 --> 07:55.168
- Hey, Angela.
- <i>Hey.</i>

07:55.253 --> 07:59.610
<i>I did a rendering of our victim's face.</i>
<i>We're checking missing persons.</i>

07:59.693 --> 08:02.207
- Wait. That's Tripp Goddard.
- <i>Tripp Goddard?</i>

08:02.293 --> 08:05.842
The motorcycle racer.
I forget sometimes I'm talking to girls.

08:05.933 --> 08:11.007
That explains the wrist and neck injuries on
Zack's report. Have him confirm with dentals.

08:11.093 --> 08:13.527
I don't appreciate the "girls" comment.

08:13.613 --> 08:17.811
Uh, Tripp won a huge motorcycle race
about two weeks ago.

08:17.893 --> 08:21.772
- That fits time of death.
- That's the Super Grand Prix in Virginia.

08:21.853 --> 08:25.641
Tripp won after some kind of accident
took out the frontrunner.

08:25.733 --> 08:28.327
- Mm.
- Girls, huh?

08:38.573 --> 08:41.849
It's not the machine, it's the man.
Sure, you need a great bike.

08:41.933 --> 08:44.572
But a great rider on a crap bike -
still gonna win.

08:44.653 --> 08:48.566
Riders say it's the rider, mechanics say
the bike. I say it's who signs the checks.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.213
- And that would be you.
- Yes. And don't forget it.

08:51.293 --> 08:55.923
Excuse me. FBI Special Agent Booth. Dr
Temperance Brennan from the Jeffersonian.

08:56.013 --> 08:59.050
We're looking for someone
who can tell us about Tripp Goddard.

08:59.133 --> 09:04.082
Uh, well, I'm Phillipa Fitz, and
Tripp rides for our family team, Slam Bolt.

09:04.173 --> 09:05.572
- What'd he do?
- Who are you?

09:05.653 --> 09:08.531
Garth Jodrey. I'm a journalist.
Motokneescrapers.com.

09:08.613 --> 09:12.686
- What does that mean?
- Racers, when they lean into the corners,

09:12.773 --> 09:15.924
- their knees scrape the asphalt.
- Explains his knee injuries.

09:16.013 --> 09:18.686
No one has seen Tripp
since the Super Grand Prix.

09:18.773 --> 09:19.842
Where did he go?

09:19.933 --> 09:23.687
After a big win he takes off in his truck,
climbs mountains, swims oceans.

09:23.773 --> 09:25.889
No one knows for sure.
Can I help you?

09:25.973 --> 09:28.043
Mr Goddard's dead.

09:29.133 --> 09:31.124
What? What happened?

09:31.213 --> 09:33.773
We believe he was murdered.

09:35.213 --> 09:38.205
Who would kill Tripp?
I don't know.

09:38.293 --> 09:41.330
Well, the fans loved him.
Everybody else hated him.

09:41.413 --> 09:43.449
- Get lost, Garth.
- Daddy, please.

09:43.533 --> 09:46.331
No. I want him out of here, Phillipa.

09:48.133 --> 09:51.011
Garth doesn't think Tripp
was a good ol' boy. You do.

09:51.093 --> 09:53.323
- He's got his reasons.
- The wheelchair.

09:53.413 --> 09:57.088
- Tripp put him in that chair?
- Racing accident a couple of years ago.

09:57.173 --> 10:01.371
You can't believe Garth had anything
to do with this. I mean, how?

10:01.453 --> 10:02.602
With help.

10:02.693 --> 10:05.685
- When did you last see Tripp?
- Victory party after the race.

10:05.773 --> 10:08.810
I saw him get in his truck
and leave around midnight.

10:08.893 --> 10:12.647
Great. I need the make, the model,
the year, license plate of the truck.

10:12.733 --> 10:17.761
Anything you need, we're here.
Just find the bastard who did this to him.

10:41.813 --> 10:44.122
<i>Ha-ha-ha. Yeah.</i>

10:44.213 --> 10:46.363
OK, that's Danny Fitz.

10:47.213 --> 10:51.001
I would've loved to have decked Tripp
after our race, only I was in a coma.

10:51.093 --> 10:54.403
- Another Fitz?
- Lenny's son, Phillipa's twin brother.

10:54.493 --> 10:57.053
Watch this.
Danny's got the race in the bag.

10:57.133 --> 11:01.490
Final lap, Tripp does <i>that.</i>
Classic inside-out block pass.

11:01.573 --> 11:03.404
- Is it allowed?
- If it's an accident.

11:03.493 --> 11:07.771
Slam Bolt were first and second ahead of
Flame Spark till Tripp clipped Danny.

11:07.853 --> 11:12.324
- There's someone named Flame Spark?
- Flame Spark spark plugs. Slam Bolt's rival.

11:12.413 --> 11:16.611
<i>I saw a little daylight. Looked like Danny</i>
<i>was gonna go wide, so I went for it.</i>

11:16.693 --> 11:21.084
<i>It's a bummer when somebody loses the front</i>
<i>of their bike like that, but what can you do?</i>

11:21.173 --> 11:26.088
- Danny had that race in the bag.
- Tripp did the same thing to you, didn't he?

11:26.933 --> 11:32.212
Yeah. Well, I guess Tripp didn't learn anything
from the time he did that to me.

11:32.293 --> 11:37.208
- Danny Fitz, was he at the victory party?
- Yeah, absolutely. Brave face for the press.

11:37.293 --> 11:40.922
- Did Danny leave before or after Tripp?
- About the same time.

11:41.013 --> 11:43.766
- How about you?
- I took off right after.

11:43.853 --> 11:46.413
<i>- Hey.</i>
<i>- Hey, hey, hey.</i>

11:46.493 --> 11:51.521
- You're good friends with Danny, aren't you?
- Good enough friends to kill Tripp together?

11:51.613 --> 11:56.050
You know, I'm pretty sure I don't
have to say anything without a lawyer.

12:04.693 --> 12:07.526
- It's not going to work.
- What?

12:07.613 --> 12:09.968
Dropping loud pieces of metal
to hurry me up.

12:10.053 --> 12:13.329
I need the skull to compare tool marks
to murder weapons.

12:13.413 --> 12:15.722
You're just gonna have to wait.

12:18.413 --> 12:23.123
Titanium, magnesium and boron particulates
are embedded in these skull fractures.

12:23.213 --> 12:25.283
- Mm...
- What?

12:25.373 --> 12:29.252
That's an exotic combination
of metals not found in any of these.

12:31.413 --> 12:35.645
It is possible these particulates aren't
from the tool. Not the tool alone.

12:35.733 --> 12:39.169
- I don't understand.
- Racing motorcycles use these metals.

12:39.253 --> 12:42.768
The particles could have gone
from bicycles to tools to victim.

12:42.853 --> 12:45.731
It's not a bicycle.
It's a motorcycle.

12:45.813 --> 12:49.249
Bicycle. Two wheels.
The term applies.

12:50.293 --> 12:54.923
Drop those. Drop them.
I mean it, Zack. Bombs away.

12:57.173 --> 13:00.882
- I don't know what that proves.
- Proves I don't handle irritation well.

13:00.973 --> 13:03.362
- Can I pick these up now?
- No.

13:05.373 --> 13:09.127
You can pick one up.
The most likely culprit.

13:09.213 --> 13:12.205
A narrow instrument, less than an inch,
caused the injuries.

13:12.293 --> 13:13.567
OK.

13:13.653 --> 13:19.011
Strain - the crushing, tearing, shearing -
equals the change in dimension

13:19.093 --> 13:21.084
divided by the original dimension.

13:21.173 --> 13:23.403
I do bugs and slime,
I don't do arithmetic.

13:23.493 --> 13:28.772
An elongated rod with... this cross-section
is the most likely culprit.

13:28.853 --> 13:31.765
Good. Good job, Zack.

13:31.853 --> 13:33.844
Am I king of the lab?

13:33.933 --> 13:35.764
We both are.

13:37.133 --> 13:39.363
Let's go tell Cam.

13:42.293 --> 13:44.523
Ouch.

13:44.613 --> 13:46.808
OK, now that...
that's gotta hurt.

13:46.893 --> 13:49.566
Wait, here it comes again.
Look at that.

13:49.653 --> 13:53.771
Oh, watch it. Watch out,
watch out. Ooh. Boom.

13:53.853 --> 13:56.731
Let the record show Agent Booth
is taunting my client,

13:56.813 --> 13:59.725
repeatedly showing footage
of his traumatic accident.

13:59.813 --> 14:04.284
- Accident? Tripp did that to me on purpose.
- How fast were you going at the time?

14:04.373 --> 14:10.005
- Don't know. I accelerated through 160.
- Tripp accelerated faster. See? Whoosh.

14:10.093 --> 14:11.321
Again with taunting?

14:11.413 --> 14:14.246
- Why was Tripp so much better than you?
- Taunting?

14:14.333 --> 14:18.246
I'm not taunting, Mr Smalls.
I'm restating an objective fact.

14:18.333 --> 14:20.449
Tripp had a better bike,
20 horses on me.

14:20.533 --> 14:23.764
- You get Tripp's bike now.
- I didn't kill Tripp for his bike.

14:23.853 --> 14:26.526
- Why did you kill him?
- Full stop there, cowboy.

14:26.613 --> 14:30.526
Don't sweat it, princess. Any other reason
you'd wanna get rid of Tripp?

14:30.613 --> 14:32.365
- No.
- Danny,

14:32.453 --> 14:36.844
certain things you hide
make you look guilty.

14:36.933 --> 14:40.528
Couple years back, Tripp dated my sister.
Cheated on her with a groupie.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.205
- Came to blows.
- Who won?

14:42.293 --> 14:45.922
- I did, for once. Knocked him on his ass.
- You defended her honour.

14:46.013 --> 14:49.801
Danny and Phillipa are twins, Agent Booth.
They're very close.

14:49.893 --> 14:55.411
Cheated on your sister, forced you to crash.
How would you describe your relationship?

14:55.493 --> 14:57.768
We were the best of friends.

14:57.853 --> 15:03.291
As your lawyer, I caution you sarcasm doesn't
show up in the transcript. Best be avoided.

15:03.373 --> 15:06.809
I'm sorry Tripp's dead,
but I'm not exactly grieving. You feel me?

15:06.893 --> 15:08.565
Bones, he's not afraid of me at all.

15:08.653 --> 15:12.931
Hard to scare someone who rides around
a track at 200 miles an hour.

15:13.013 --> 15:17.404
- Her I like. You wanna go out sometime?
-  Danny, restrain yourself.

15:17.493 --> 15:19.927
- No, she doesn't.
- Let me speak for myself.

15:20.013 --> 15:22.447
Murder suspect here, Bones.

15:24.333 --> 15:26.483
- The wound at the front or the back?
- Back.

15:26.573 --> 15:28.484
- Couldn't be both?
- No.

15:28.573 --> 15:31.531
The blow to the front of the head
was from a sharp tool.

15:31.613 --> 15:34.047
- Sharper than round, blunter than sharp.
- What?

15:34.133 --> 15:38.012
- That actually made sense.
- You spend too much time together.

15:38.093 --> 15:41.881
- Can you estimate force?
- Back of the head, length undetermined.

15:41.973 --> 15:45.761
Width of 3.8cm,
approximately a thousand pounds of force.

15:45.853 --> 15:48.208
- So a lot.
- Half a ton.

15:48.293 --> 15:50.170
- Which is a lot.
- It isn't much.

15:50.253 --> 15:52.767
Now I'm back in a physics class
I wanna ditch.

15:52.853 --> 15:56.482
- A boxer's fist lands with double that force.
- A big fist in a glove.

15:56.573 --> 15:59.883
With a force spread out over
a lot more than 3.8cm.

15:59.973 --> 16:02.851
It wouldn't take much force
to crush a skull with this.

16:02.933 --> 16:06.369
So we haven't eliminated anyone
from our list of suspects.

16:06.453 --> 16:08.683
We don't know what
that's a cross-section of

16:08.773 --> 16:11.606
or what caused the damage
to the front of the face.

16:11.693 --> 16:16.164
What exactly made you two come in here
crowing "king of the lab"?

16:18.613 --> 16:22.526
I'm gonna go look at very small things
under my very large microscope.

16:24.013 --> 16:27.244
I can probably identify the type of tool
off this cross-section.

16:27.333 --> 16:30.723
Do it and call Booth.
See if it's of any use to him.

16:33.573 --> 16:35.564
- Boys.
- Wow.

16:35.693 --> 16:40.892
I don't have the weapon, but I microwaved
fabric samples and used gas sensors to...

16:40.973 --> 16:44.602
All right, let's just
cut to the chase there, OK, Mr Wizard?

16:44.693 --> 16:48.527
- I know what was on the victim's clothing.
- Fine. I'll take anything.

16:48.613 --> 16:50.888
- What is it?
- It's toluene.

16:50.973 --> 16:53.168
It's a clear liquid used to clean up oil.

16:53.253 --> 16:56.404
How is that supposed to help us?
Every mechanic uses that.

16:56.493 --> 16:59.132
I need a weapon.
Do you hear me? A weapon.

16:59.213 --> 17:02.410
You know, I'm feeling
really underappreciated today.

17:02.493 --> 17:04.131
You can suck it up, buttercup.

17:04.213 --> 17:06.204
- Booth?
- Ah.

17:08.733 --> 17:11.611
- Toluene.
- <i>It's excellent for cleaning up blood.</i>

17:11.693 --> 17:17.325
So if you killed someone here
and they bled a lot...

17:19.252 --> 17:23.165
The drain.
Hey. Check this drain for blood.

17:23.252 --> 17:27.087
Blood suspended in toluene
might be testable for DNA.

17:27.173 --> 17:31.689
- Tell Hodgins he did a good job.
- I'll tell Hodgins he did a good job if...

17:34.133 --> 17:36.169
<i>I'm waiting.</i>

17:49.933 --> 17:51.730
- I hate when you do this.
- What?

17:51.813 --> 17:53.212
You don't talk.

17:53.293 --> 17:55.602
You hate when I talk.
It's a double-edged sword.

17:55.693 --> 17:57.763
- Bones doesn't mind silence.
- Mm-mm.

17:57.853 --> 18:00.367
- I hate it.
- Why do you think that is?

18:00.453 --> 18:02.171
- He gets bored.
- You're right.

18:02.253 --> 18:06.883
You should see him on stakeouts.
He talks and talks.

18:06.973 --> 18:11.046
- Well, it's very interesting.
- Is it always about work?

18:11.133 --> 18:12.452
No.

18:13.493 --> 18:16.371
- You're lying.
- Oh, come on. How do you know that?

18:16.453 --> 18:19.047
I have training
in how to tell when people are lying.

18:19.133 --> 18:22.728
- Is that true?
- See, if you were me, you'd know.

18:25.053 --> 18:27.647
You're lying to protect your partner.
I understand.

18:27.733 --> 18:31.248
But let's agree amongst ourselves
that this is a truth zone.

18:31.333 --> 18:36.646
- Is something bothering you?
- Oh, it's this whole... going-on-a-date thing.

18:36.733 --> 18:37.927
It's not a date.

18:38.013 --> 18:41.483
It's a social outing
for the purpose of professional evaluation.

18:41.573 --> 18:44.406
Come on! Ceramics?
I'm not that kind of a guy.

18:44.493 --> 18:48.691
What do you say we go bowling
or to a firing range or climbing a wall?

18:48.773 --> 18:53.005
- Right, something you're good at?
- A movie? Or dinner. Dinner and movie.

18:53.093 --> 18:56.972
- Somewhere I don't have to make something.
- Ooh...

18:57.053 --> 18:58.486
What? What, "Ooh?"

18:58.573 --> 19:02.566
Well, what Sweets would do in this situation
is he'd jump on word usage.

19:02.653 --> 19:05.167
He'd ask you
why you're resistant to making.

19:05.253 --> 19:11.010
I "jump on" the semantics?
That's a really aggressive turn of phrase.

19:11.093 --> 19:15.689
Thanks for pulling focus there, Bones.
"Pulling." Is that an aggressive word too?

19:15.773 --> 19:18.845
- OK, did you two plan this?
-  Paranoia.

19:18.933 --> 19:20.491
That is paranoia.

19:20.573 --> 19:24.566
Since this is a truth zone,
I will tell you the truth.

19:24.653 --> 19:27.372
We didn't plan anything.

19:28.373 --> 19:30.603
- You're telling the truth.
- He's guessing.

19:30.693 --> 19:35.084
We're going to a ceramics class,
and we're all gonna make something.

19:35.173 --> 19:37.323
Time's up.

19:53.933 --> 19:57.642
Sweets can't tell if someone's lying.
He's playing with our minds.

19:57.733 --> 20:01.328
An area of study called neurolinguistics
proposes that

20:01.413 --> 20:03.847
subconscious eye movements
and body language

20:03.933 --> 20:07.005
tell a well-trained observer
if the subject is lying.

20:07.093 --> 20:09.368
Yeah, well, I don't believe it.

20:09.453 --> 20:11.205
Huh, I don't believe it.

20:11.293 --> 20:15.491
- Is that Tripp's bike?
- Yeah. Danny's gonna get what he wants.

20:15.573 --> 20:19.566
Do me a favour, son. Take it easy
couple times around before you blast off.

20:19.653 --> 20:22.565
- I know, Dad. Ease into it.
- Can I get a picture?

20:22.653 --> 20:26.805
Let's get a picture. Number one on the Slam
Bolt racing team. That's gotta feel good.

20:26.893 --> 20:30.932
- I'm not talking to you without my lawyer.
-  That goes for all of us.

20:31.013 --> 20:34.972
Look, you, you I can replace.
Do not wreck my bike.

20:46.813 --> 20:49.691
Lenny, I'm thinkin'
your boy won't relax into this.

20:49.773 --> 20:53.812
Well, Danny gets a chance to grab
the brass ring, he's gonna take it.

21:00.053 --> 21:05.366
Watch this. He's gonna decelerate before
the turn and slingshot right through it.

21:05.453 --> 21:07.967
I don't see the deceleration part.

21:09.893 --> 21:10.882
No, no...

21:15.253 --> 21:17.403
Danny's down!

21:20.293 --> 21:22.807
-  Move! Let's get in there!
- No! <i>No!</i>

21:22.893 --> 21:24.611
No!  No.

21:24.693 --> 21:28.288
-  Get in there.
-  Get that out!

21:28.373 --> 21:30.409
No, Daddy.

21:30.493 --> 21:34.611
We're at the Belleville practice track,
Highway 64. Send an air ambulance.

21:34.693 --> 21:36.843
There's been a motorcycle accident.

21:45.533 --> 21:47.410
- Where's your father?
- At the house.

21:47.493 --> 21:49.927
He's had two heart attacks.
He shouldn't be here.

21:50.013 --> 21:53.562
- Seems a crime to mess with a sweet bike.
- A crime like murder.

21:53.653 --> 21:58.044
- Right. I just meant the bike itself.
- No, I get it. You like bikes.

21:58.133 --> 22:01.170
These rotors are laser cut and honed.
Very exact.

22:01.253 --> 22:06.691
Bend one a little, when it gets to speed the
rotor hits a brake pad. Next thing you know...

22:06.773 --> 22:09.367
- Yes. We saw.
- So it wasn't an accident?

22:09.453 --> 22:13.605
You mean, "Oops, I stuck a piece of metal
through here and pushed with all my might?"

22:13.693 --> 22:15.126
So anyone could do this?

22:15.213 --> 22:18.285
Anyone who's familiar with motorcycles...
and who's a killer.

22:18.373 --> 22:23.401
- Why would anyone wanna kill Danny?
- You can't be near the evidence. I'm sorry.

22:23.493 --> 22:26.690
See what else you can find, will ya?

22:29.893 --> 22:33.044
Recovering ink traces on plastic
and polymers is problematic,

22:33.133 --> 22:36.887
so I am using a new technique.

22:36.973 --> 22:41.330
A little of the reagent eugenol, and...

22:41.413 --> 22:45.042
Voilà. "EE S APERS DO CO".

22:45.133 --> 22:47.806
- Mean anything to you?
- Korean restaurant?

22:47.893 --> 22:51.363
Unlikely. There are obviously
missing letters.

22:51.453 --> 22:55.651
We need the consonants most likely to appear
with this configuration of vowels,

22:55.733 --> 22:57.485
and vowels to consonants.

22:57.573 --> 23:01.168
- That is an enormous amount of variables.
- Shh.

23:01.253 --> 23:04.325
- "Lee Snappers doll company".
- Don't think so.

23:04.413 --> 23:06.643
"Free newspapers dot com".

23:06.733 --> 23:09.088
"Keen snappers don't come".

23:09.173 --> 23:12.643
- Definitely not.
- "Knee scrapers dot com".

23:12.733 --> 23:15.452
Oh, my God. That's it.

23:15.533 --> 23:18.570
Motokneescrapers. com.
How did you do that?

23:18.653 --> 23:21.725
Process of elimination.
I have no idea what it means.

23:21.813 --> 23:24.964
The website of the journalist
Tripp put in a wheelchair.

23:25.053 --> 23:27.362
So this man's pen was found on the victim.

23:27.453 --> 23:32.083
Or it fell in the mud
when the body was dumped.

23:38.613 --> 23:43.209
I'm enjoying this. Last time I threw pots,
I was in Colombia with the Arhuaco Indians.

23:43.293 --> 23:46.763
Last time I did something like this,
I was in nursery school.

23:46.853 --> 23:49.811
- Well, we love it. Don't we, Lance?
- Yes.

23:49.893 --> 23:53.886
Well, I love my work, but I'm not
gonna talk about that right now.

23:53.973 --> 23:57.602
Even though we think a paraplegic
killed Tripp Goddard.

23:57.693 --> 24:00.844
- That sounds fascinating.
- April...

24:00.933 --> 24:02.525
Oopsie.

24:02.613 --> 24:05.173
Dr Sweet says that you work
with tropical fish.

24:05.253 --> 24:07.926
Yes. I love fish.

24:08.013 --> 24:11.244
- They're just like people.
- No. No, they're not, actually.

24:11.333 --> 24:14.405
People can't breathe underwater.

24:14.493 --> 24:15.972
She's funny.

24:16.053 --> 24:18.726
I... am? What?
Why is that funny?

24:18.813 --> 24:20.929
- She didn't mean that literally.
- Oh.

24:21.013 --> 24:23.971
It's their eyes.
You can tell so much from eyes.

24:24.053 --> 24:27.284
In humans, a retinal scan is as specific
as a fingerprint.

24:27.373 --> 24:29.841
No, no. Their souls.

24:29.933 --> 24:32.083
You can see their little souls.

24:32.173 --> 24:36.086
I don't understand.
You believe that fish have souls?

24:36.173 --> 24:40.769
Yes. You can see it in their colouring.
It's a reflection of who they are.

24:40.853 --> 24:44.243
Their colouring developed
as a way to deal with predators.

24:44.333 --> 24:47.689
- April means they're beautiful.
- Don't tell me what I mean.

24:47.773 --> 24:50.765
- I mean they have souls.
-  OK.

24:50.853 --> 24:54.607
Hey, look what I'm making.

24:54.693 --> 24:56.285
- You've done this before.
- No.

24:56.373 --> 24:59.285
- You have.
- You really think that's good?

24:59.373 --> 25:00.601
Yes, very.

25:00.693 --> 25:03.526
- Yours is good, too, April.
- I'm not talking to you.

25:05.493 --> 25:07.131
You think that's funny?

25:07.213 --> 25:10.171
- Are they fighting?
- Just focus on your pot.

25:10.253 --> 25:13.609
- I'm with patients, April.
- Oh, no, no patients tonight.

25:13.693 --> 25:17.163
Just us people making pots.

25:17.253 --> 25:20.609
- You can't apologise for me.
- Can we please just move on?

25:20.693 --> 25:22.126
No.

25:22.213 --> 25:25.922
I just... I meant...
I believe that all creatures -

25:26.013 --> 25:29.528
people, fish, dogs -
we're all connected.

25:29.613 --> 25:33.288
We all share the same stuff
that makes life so beautiful and precious.

25:33.373 --> 25:39.005
On a quantum level that's... true,
although the word "stuff" is not accurate.

25:39.093 --> 25:41.004
See?

25:41.093 --> 25:43.732
What? I have great respect for your fish.

25:43.813 --> 25:46.452
Admittedly, I might relate
to other things more.

25:46.533 --> 25:51.482
- He kills about a thousand people a night.
- Yeah, in a video game. They're not real.

25:51.573 --> 25:54.406
Sweets, your, uh, thing there is droopy.

25:56.133 --> 25:58.806
- Wow. Look at my horse.
-  Wow.

25:58.893 --> 26:01.851
That's amazing, Agent Booth.

26:01.933 --> 26:04.891
- Very impressive.
- Yes, it is.

26:05.853 --> 26:08.765
Ooh, Bones, I'm sorry.
Ohh, jeez!

26:10.933 --> 26:13.731
Sweets, I apologise.
This ceramic thing is great.

26:19.893 --> 26:21.372
Oh.

26:21.453 --> 26:24.684
Yeah, this is fun.

26:34.653 --> 26:37.326
Tell ya one thing -
Sweets didn't get any last night.

26:37.413 --> 26:39.722
They're too young
for a serious relationship.

26:39.813 --> 26:43.283
In agrarian societies,
young couplings made sense.

26:43.373 --> 26:46.729
The partnership was for survival.
But today...

26:46.813 --> 26:50.362
You know you can play the field
and not plough it.

26:52.573 --> 26:54.882
- That was distasteful.
- What?

26:54.973 --> 26:57.089
- I like April.
- She talks to fish.

26:57.173 --> 26:59.767
Ha. I'm with Sweets on this one.

26:59.853 --> 27:02.321
Brennan.

27:02.413 --> 27:05.132
- Hey, it's Zack.
- Hi, Zack.

27:05.213 --> 27:07.807
<i>The pry bar from the garage</i>
<i>is not the murder weapon.</i>

27:07.893 --> 27:10.487
It's a pry bar like this one
but not this one.

27:10.573 --> 27:13.690
The parallel grooves on the interior border
are not a match.

27:13.773 --> 27:17.527
<i>- What about the blood?</i>
- Toluene caused a false positive.

27:17.613 --> 27:20.207
And the vertical fracture
on the frontal suture?

27:20.293 --> 27:23.091
- It's the forehead.
- <i>I did another scraping.</i>

27:23.173 --> 27:26.290
I found a sliver of glass
with a mastic film on it.

27:26.373 --> 27:31.925
The mass spec shows it as a nitrate of silver.
I think we're looking for some kind of mirror.

27:32.013 --> 27:34.004
Good. Thank you.

27:35.373 --> 27:38.968
Found it this morning.
No way to know how long it's been here.

27:39.053 --> 27:42.648
My guess is it was stolen, driven around,
then stripped for parts.

27:42.733 --> 27:45.611
- VIN number matches?
- It's the victim's truck.

27:45.693 --> 27:49.049
Hey, I gotta tell you,
I love working this one.

27:49.133 --> 27:51.693
I'm usually looking over
some battered heap.

27:51.773 --> 27:55.049
The vehicles on this case -
they are sweet.

27:55.133 --> 27:56.168
Anything else?

27:56.253 --> 28:00.041
They're testing mud on the vehicle.
Might match where the victim was dumped.

28:00.133 --> 28:01.407
- Pry bar.
-  Huh?

28:01.493 --> 28:02.846
Pry bar.

28:02.933 --> 28:05.845
Yep. Covered in blood.

28:05.933 --> 28:08.049
- I blame the Stooges.
- Excuse me?

28:08.133 --> 28:12.809
The Three Stooges always bashed each other
with hammers and bricks and never got hurt.

28:12.893 --> 28:15.009
- People think they can do it too.
- Thanks.

28:15.093 --> 28:18.130
All I'm saying is
killings like this are Stooge-related.

28:18.213 --> 28:19.931
- Booth.
- Yeah?

28:20.013 --> 28:22.083
The side mirror.

28:23.853 --> 28:29.132
Long jagged edge. He was standing by his
truck. Someone came up behind and hit him.

28:29.213 --> 28:31.966
- Falls forward...
- Fracturing his frontonasal suture.

28:32.053 --> 28:33.850
- Huh?
-  Forehead.

28:33.933 --> 28:37.926
- This suggests only one assailant.
- Can we get luminol, check for blood?

28:38.013 --> 28:42.245
We're not hurting for blood around here.
Check this out.

28:42.333 --> 28:43.812
Love these... Whoa.

28:43.893 --> 28:47.169
-  Oh.
- Don't need any luminol for this.

28:47.253 --> 28:49.767
He was loaded in the box,
driven to the mud and dumped.

28:49.853 --> 28:52.003
That's impossible for a paraplegic to do.

28:52.093 --> 28:54.846
If it's only one murderer, it wasn't Garth.
Any prints?

28:54.933 --> 28:58.892
Just the victim's. We did find some hair
in the box where the body was placed.

28:58.973 --> 29:03.012
It's dyed. We're checking
for the exact brand and colour.

29:03.093 --> 29:06.165
The roots are grey.
It's short.

29:06.253 --> 29:09.848
Lenny Fitz dyes his hair.

29:09.933 --> 29:13.721
Why would Lenny kill
his most valuable rider?

29:18.213 --> 29:22.001
I'd like the record to reflect
that my client has been drinking.

29:22.093 --> 29:23.651
That's an understatement.

29:23.733 --> 29:27.089
And he's rejecting my advice
not to speak to you at this time.

29:27.173 --> 29:31.405
- Drinking a lot, maybe out of guilt?
- I lost a son, Agent Booth.

29:31.493 --> 29:35.042
A son. So excuse me for feeling bad
about that, all right?

29:35.133 --> 29:37.806
Do you mean your biological son
or Tripp Goddard?

29:37.893 --> 29:41.408
Lady, I loved Tripp Goddard like a son,

29:41.493 --> 29:45.691
but Danny... Danny was my son.
There's a difference.

29:45.773 --> 29:51.405
I'm confused. Is my client a person of interest
or an actual suspect, and in which death?

29:51.493 --> 29:56.442
That depends upon whether or not
the same person killed both Danny and Tripp.

29:56.533 --> 29:59.889
- You can't think I killed either of them.
- They found Tripp's truck.

29:59.973 --> 30:01.850
- Where?
- Jackson State Park.

30:01.933 --> 30:06.211
Forensic evidence shows Tripp was murdered
in the mechanics' bay.

30:06.293 --> 30:10.127
- His body was transported in his truck.
- What's that to do with my client?

30:10.213 --> 30:13.171
There's forensic evidence
tying him to the body.

30:13.253 --> 30:17.292
What you got - a nail clipping?
A piece of dried snot? A hair?

30:17.373 --> 30:20.922
No, we got... forensic evidence.

30:21.013 --> 30:24.847
- Lenny, when did you last see Tripp?
- At the victory party.

30:24.933 --> 30:28.084
You shook hands, sat next to him?
Did you make out a little?

30:28.173 --> 30:29.686
I hugged him.

30:29.773 --> 30:34.972
Any questions about how trace evidence
from my client wound up on Tripp's remains?

30:35.053 --> 30:37.806
- Hold him on suspicion.
- I didn't kill Tripp.

30:37.893 --> 30:41.442
I can get a court order to release him
in less than an hour.

30:41.533 --> 30:44.605
Why would I kill somebody
I just signed a business deal with?

30:44.693 --> 30:45.967
Wait. You what?

30:46.053 --> 30:49.602
Mr Fitz signed 10% of his company
over to Tripp.

30:49.693 --> 30:53.129
- You mean the motorcycle team.
- No, the beverage company.

30:53.213 --> 30:55.249
Slam Bolt Energy Drinks?

30:55.333 --> 30:57.767
Why offer so much?

30:57.853 --> 30:59.332
Cos he was the best.

30:59.413 --> 31:04.168
I offered him a piece of the business as an
incentive to race exclusively for Slam Bolt.

31:04.253 --> 31:06.323
- And everybody's happy.
- Who isn't happy?

31:06.413 --> 31:10.008
- Every other motorcycle team.
- Did Tripp Goddard sign?

31:10.093 --> 31:12.891
- I only got him the contract that night.
- Then hugged him.

31:12.973 --> 31:16.443
- So you signed it, but he didn't?
- We don't know.

31:16.533 --> 31:19.923
You haven't found the contract, have you?

31:20.013 --> 31:22.163
We'll be in touch.

31:25.813 --> 31:29.772
Sexual jealousy as a motive didn't pan out.
Professional jealousy looked good.

31:29.853 --> 31:32.492
- Until Danny was killed.
- But money is always good.

31:32.573 --> 31:33.847
How much money?

31:33.933 --> 31:37.289
A company like Slam Bolt?
Millions is my guess.

31:37.373 --> 31:40.445
Tripp could have been attacked
by more than one person.

31:40.533 --> 31:44.003
- The skull shows that as a possibility.
- No changies, Bones.

31:44.093 --> 31:47.881
Pry bar to the skull, mirror to the face.
No takebacks. One killer.

31:47.973 --> 31:50.533
Maybe Phillipa and Danny didn't like it

31:50.613 --> 31:53.969
when their father signed over
a chunk of the family company to Tripp.

31:54.053 --> 31:56.123
It's a good business decision.

31:56.213 --> 31:59.808
Look, Garth wants Tripp dead
for putting him in a wheelchair,

31:59.893 --> 32:02.930
Phillipa wants Tripp dead
for grabbing the company.

32:03.013 --> 32:06.767
Two killers again?
You said no changies and no takebacks.

32:06.853 --> 32:10.732
Doesn't scan. Why would Garth
or Phillipa want Danny dead?

32:10.813 --> 32:14.772
- You're the motive guy.
- We found Garth's pen in the mud.

32:14.853 --> 32:18.846
That doesn't prove anything.
He gave them out to everybody.

32:20.093 --> 32:24.609
It's right here, Bones.
It's right in front of us, but I just can't get it.

32:24.693 --> 32:28.971
That whole business with changies
and takebacks, it's... not real, right?

32:29.053 --> 32:31.089
No.

32:31.933 --> 32:33.651
I have another question.

32:33.733 --> 32:36.805
"Is there anything more
we can learn from the weapon?"

32:36.893 --> 32:38.531
No, that's a you question.

32:38.613 --> 32:44.449
My question is, how did the murderer know
about the secret mudhole?

32:45.853 --> 32:45.893
I know I was breaking the rules
when I drove my truck on national park land.

32:45.893 --> 32:50.171
I know I was breaking the rules
when I drove my truck on national park land.

32:50.253 --> 32:52.892
But this girl - didn't you see her?

32:52.973 --> 32:55.806
- I really don't care about that.
- Have a heart.

32:55.893 --> 32:58.691
I got it about the girl
the minute I saw her, OK?

32:58.773 --> 33:02.482
We all do things for the girl.

33:02.573 --> 33:06.532
- So what do you need to talk to me for?
- How did you find out about that mudhole?

33:06.613 --> 33:08.046
Oh.

33:08.133 --> 33:11.523
- "Oh" what?
- I don't wanna be a rat.

33:11.613 --> 33:16.050
Look, sport, I don't care about the girl
or the mud or the 4x4.

33:16.133 --> 33:20.968
Hardly anyone knows about that place,
and someone dumped the body there.

33:21.053 --> 33:22.771
- My friend told me.
- A name.

33:22.853 --> 33:25.083
He didn't do it.
He's in a wheelchair.

33:25.173 --> 33:27.687
- His name Garth Jodrey?
- How'd you know?

33:27.773 --> 33:30.287
"Special Agent Seeley Booth".

33:30.373 --> 33:31.772
"Special".

33:35.333 --> 33:39.372
The shaft of the pry bar is tempered steel
with a shiny chrome covering.

33:39.453 --> 33:41.250
The murder weapon on Tripp's truck?

33:41.333 --> 33:44.006
Yes. As you see,
the chrome is compromised.

33:44.093 --> 33:47.210
Putting chrome on a pry bar
is not good functionality.

33:47.293 --> 33:49.807
- Maybe it was decorative.
- Those are blood flecks.

33:49.893 --> 33:53.090
- From the victim?
- No way to know until a DNA test is done.

33:53.173 --> 33:57.371
The blood flecks begin approximately 25%
of the way up the handle.

33:57.453 --> 33:59.967
- What does that indicate?
- I have no idea.

34:00.053 --> 34:03.363
Come on. Choke?

34:03.453 --> 34:06.445
Didn't anybody play
softball or baseball?

34:06.533 --> 34:08.125
OK.

34:11.092 --> 34:12.572
It's a choke-up.

34:12.652 --> 34:16.726
For somebody not strong enough
to swing the entire length of the bat.

34:16.813 --> 34:18.326
It's a choke-up.

34:18.413 --> 34:21.371
To foreshorten the fulcrum.

34:21.453 --> 34:24.763
Yes, I see.
Because the murderer was weaker

34:24.853 --> 34:27.731
than the full-grown male
for whom the pry bar was designed.

34:27.813 --> 34:29.531
Right, like a girl.

34:29.612 --> 34:33.652
Now, when I batted,
I always had to choke up.

34:33.733 --> 34:36.201
- Then, of course, I kicked ass.
- Sweet.

34:36.293 --> 34:38.523
I'll have Cam check the DNA.

34:43.213 --> 34:45.168
Excuse me.
Temperance?

34:45.253 --> 34:46.844
April. Hi.

34:46.933 --> 34:50.687
I, uh, wanted to talk to you
woman to woman, if that's possible.

34:50.773 --> 34:54.561
It is possible
because we are both women.

35:00.373 --> 35:04.332
Seeing you the other night made me realise
you have a very objective eye.

35:04.413 --> 35:06.768
- Thank you.
- You saw Lance and me together.

35:06.853 --> 35:11.290
I wonder if... if you might
tell me what you think.

35:11.373 --> 35:14.206
W... Could you be more specific
in the question?

35:14.933 --> 35:17.163
Um...

35:17.253 --> 35:21.929
Fish. Fish choose their mates
based primarily on colour gradations.

35:22.013 --> 35:26.882
Two gouramis, for example, they'll mate
if they're both vibrant blue.

35:26.973 --> 35:31.603
Now, if the male becomes paler,
which can happen over the course of time,

35:31.693 --> 35:35.652
the female becomes...
nonreceptive to the male.

35:35.733 --> 35:38.372
Even aggressive.
Do you see where I'm going?

35:38.453 --> 35:42.241
- Sweets is too pale.
- Yes.

35:42.333 --> 35:46.167
But let's say "young" instead of "pale"
and go with that.

35:46.253 --> 35:48.972
- Is there an age difference?
- Yeah.

35:49.053 --> 35:51.806
I'm almost 27
and Lance just turned 23.

35:53.773 --> 35:56.207
What's the age difference
between you and Booth?

35:56.293 --> 35:59.171
F... five years, but no.

35:59.253 --> 36:02.529
- We are not blue fish.
- Oh.

36:03.453 --> 36:06.604
Still, he's very firm
once you get him out of that suit, but...

36:06.693 --> 36:10.003
- Pale blue.
- Robin's egg, really.

36:10.093 --> 36:12.323
And I'm a vibrant, vibrant cobalt.

36:14.133 --> 36:16.601
Not literally.
We're both mostly pink in reality.

36:16.693 --> 36:18.809
No, I understand.

36:18.893 --> 36:21.361
Did we seem good together to you?

36:21.453 --> 36:24.445
April, it was only one evening.

36:26.213 --> 36:29.171
- We got the DNA results from the weapon.
- Sex?

36:29.253 --> 36:32.370
So much more than adequate.
It was wonderful, really.

36:32.453 --> 36:37.732
He's a night-time person, I'm enthusiastic
in the morning, but that's not the problem.

36:38.813 --> 36:40.531
Oh. Sorry.

36:40.613 --> 36:43.605
You were... you were talking about work.

36:45.813 --> 36:48.691
DNA says the murderer's female.

36:49.813 --> 36:52.088
Excuse me.
We're here about a mud bath?

36:52.173 --> 36:56.963
We got a statement from Jodrey that Phillipa
took him to the mudhole three years ago.

36:57.053 --> 36:59.647
- To have sex.
- Same mudhole Tripp was dumped in.

36:59.733 --> 37:02.611
I can give you a statement
that <i>Garth</i> took <i>me</i> there.

37:02.693 --> 37:05.332
- Ooh, I slid that one right by her.
- What?

37:05.413 --> 37:09.292
You just admitted you had prior knowledge
to the location of a mudhole.

37:09.373 --> 37:11.250
- No changies.
- No takebacks.

37:11.333 --> 37:13.722
Answer nothing
without confirmation from me.

37:13.813 --> 37:17.249
You killed Tripp. Your father
was signing the company over to him.

37:17.333 --> 37:19.972
- What?
- Don't respond in any way.

37:20.053 --> 37:24.365
We have DNA evidence that shows
you swung the pry bar into Tripp's head.

37:24.453 --> 37:30.085
According to the report, the sample was small
and was totally used up during the test.

37:30.173 --> 37:33.051
- It's an accurate test.
- But it can't be repeated.

37:33.133 --> 37:35.363
And my client has a twin brother.

37:35.453 --> 37:40.163
Juries hate DNA evidence and twins.
What's that sound?

37:40.253 --> 37:43.450
I believe that's reasonable doubt
starting its engines.

37:43.533 --> 37:48.368
We have evidence that the same pry bar
was used to sabotage Tripp's motorcycle.

37:48.453 --> 37:51.843
A common tool left in a semi-public area

37:51.933 --> 37:55.687
in a situation that may have resulted
from incompetence, not sabotage.

37:55.773 --> 37:57.764
You sabotaged the bike to kill Tripp.

37:57.853 --> 38:02.131
But he signed the contract before he could
ride it and die the way he was supposed to.

38:02.213 --> 38:07.207
So you killed him, loaded him onto his own
truck and dumped him in the mud puddle.

38:07.293 --> 38:11.889
Everything was great until your brother
rode the bike that you sabotaged.

38:11.973 --> 38:15.170
- You don't ride someone else's bike.
- Phillipa...

38:15.253 --> 38:18.325
You killed him. Accidentally,
but you did kill him.

38:18.413 --> 38:22.884
- I loved my brother.
- Don't speak, please.

38:22.973 --> 38:25.726
Can we go, or do you want
to waste more taxpayer money?

38:25.813 --> 38:29.044
- She did it.
- You may get a prosecutor to lay a charge,

38:29.133 --> 38:33.092
but a jury will never bring home this baby
the way you want it to.

38:33.173 --> 38:35.004
You're right.

38:35.093 --> 38:39.609
- But I'm still gonna make the arrest.
- To what end? You can't win.

38:39.693 --> 38:43.481
To let everybody know what Phillipa did,
including her father.

38:49.213 --> 38:54.003
- I'm OK with what you did there.
- Mm, yeah. Thanks a million, Bones.

38:54.093 --> 38:57.449
Don't get mad.
I'm just saying that...

38:57.533 --> 39:01.765
I just like it better
when we catch 'em and they go to jail.

39:01.853 --> 39:05.528
Sometimes it can get messy, Bones,
but the point is, it gets done.

39:05.613 --> 39:09.003
This one started out in a pit of mud
and ended in a pit of mud.

39:09.093 --> 39:12.005
Ha ha.
That's very damn poetic of you.

39:13.453 --> 39:16.923
Oh, hey, guys.
I didn't know you'd be here.

39:18.053 --> 39:19.771
What do you think, Bones?

39:19.853 --> 39:22.845
He's lying.
You wanna sit down?

39:22.933 --> 39:24.446
Not really.

39:24.533 --> 39:26.808
Lying again.

39:26.893 --> 39:29.771
- Come on, sit down.
- OK.

39:36.493 --> 39:38.927
- April dump you?
- How do you know that?

39:39.013 --> 39:41.971
He's got that dumpee look on his face.

39:42.053 --> 39:45.728
I'm a trained psychologist.
I mean, I saw this coming.

39:45.813 --> 39:48.486
It's not like the signs eluded me.

39:48.573 --> 39:51.167
So I prepared myself mentally for it...

39:51.253 --> 39:54.450
Hey, Sweets, Bones and I,
we're going bowling tonight.

39:54.533 --> 39:56.967
Yes. Yes, bowling.

39:57.973 --> 40:01.045
You wanna come?
To go bowling with us at the bowling rink?

40:01.133 --> 40:04.921
- Alley.
- Bowling alley. The bowling alley.

40:05.013 --> 40:07.766
You know,
fish aren't actually sentient.

40:07.853 --> 40:11.368
There's a reason people say
"cold as a fish".

40:12.133 --> 40:14.931
Me, I'm a dog person.

40:15.013 --> 40:18.130
I think that has meaning.
Don't you?

40:18.213 --> 40:20.283
Sure.

40:20.373 --> 40:23.206
You think April was pretty?

40:26.853 --> 40:29.208
Not... at all.

40:29.293 --> 40:33.286
You're lying, Dr Brennan.
I appreciate the effort. Thank you.

40:33.373 --> 40:36.171
Come on, Sweets.
What do you say we go bowling?

40:36.253 --> 40:38.483
- I got him. Come on.
- No, that's all right.

40:38.573 --> 40:40.564
Come on.

41:16.973 --> 41:18.326
What's that mean?

41:19.013 --> 41:21.004
