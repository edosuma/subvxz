WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:03.571
Whoo!

00:03.604 --> 00:04.905
* Here we go

00:04.938 --> 00:08.209
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

00:08.242 --> 00:10.311
ANNOUNCER:
The following is a presentation

00:10.344 --> 00:11.979
of The Supermarket Channel,

00:12.012 --> 00:16.350
home of the 2013 Grocery Games.

00:16.384 --> 00:20.654
NARRATOR: Natesville. Two towns
over from Anytown, U.S.A.

00:20.688 --> 00:23.557
It's the kind of town
where people still do business

00:23.591 --> 00:25.226
with a handshake.

00:25.259 --> 00:28.096
Where every citizen--
four-legged or not--

00:28.129 --> 00:31.332
is treated
with the same level of respect.

00:31.365 --> 00:35.369
Natesville has a long history
of not having much history,

00:35.403 --> 00:37.871
but that's about to change.

00:37.905 --> 00:42.676
The 2013 International
Grocery Games

00:42.710 --> 00:44.678
have been awarded

00:44.712 --> 00:47.348
to Natesville.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.882
(cheering)

00:48.916 --> 00:51.285
Finally Natesville will be known
for something other than being

00:51.319 --> 00:53.921
the town with that weird hum
no one can track down.

00:53.954 --> 00:57.258
(distant humming)

01:01.562 --> 01:04.232
BARNEY: I'm a bit
of a Grocery Games junkie.

01:04.265 --> 01:08.202
This is a-a poster from
the inaugural Games in 1986.

01:08.236 --> 01:10.371
When Reagan and Gorbachev
finally sat down face-to-face

01:10.404 --> 01:12.373
and found a way
for our two countries

01:12.406 --> 01:15.709
to challenge each other without
resorting to nuclear weapons--

01:15.743 --> 01:17.411
the Grocery Games.

01:17.445 --> 01:22.383
And to this day, the American
team has never won the Games.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.386
This year,
that is going to change.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.555
NARRATOR: Barney and the rest
of Natesville's confidence

01:27.588 --> 01:31.759
is so high because this year,
the American squad is stocked

01:31.792 --> 01:33.994
with Grade A grocery talent.

01:34.027 --> 01:37.064
Stacy Finley, can-stacker.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.168
Danny Bronson, grocery-bagger.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.670
(starting pistol fires)
Paul Kroll,

01:42.703 --> 01:44.638
champion cart-wrangler.

01:44.672 --> 01:48.409
Last but not least, the anchor
leg of the competition,

01:48.442 --> 01:50.811
the event that separates
the men from the stock boys--

01:50.844 --> 01:53.614
the deli platter assembly.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.783
American Brett Sommerstein,
ironically

01:55.816 --> 01:58.752
a vegetarian, is the best
slicer of deli meats

01:58.786 --> 02:01.389
this country has ever produced.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.792
But victory is far
from guaranteed,

02:04.825 --> 02:09.197
as this year's Russian team
is as strong as ever.

02:10.564 --> 02:14.935
Local Natesvillapudlians open
their hearts and their homes

02:14.968 --> 02:17.205
to these gladiators
of the grocery

02:17.238 --> 02:20.374
in an unselfish show
of sportsmanship and kindness.

02:20.408 --> 02:22.543
What'd he bring us? What'd he
bring us? What'd he bring us?

02:22.576 --> 02:26.947
Looks like... a bottle
of turnip vodka,

02:26.980 --> 02:29.950
some dried fish

02:29.983 --> 02:31.485
and a bunch of socks.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.053
Ooh, I need socks.

02:33.086 --> 02:35.122
This hosting thing
is awesome.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.458
I'm so glad we got...
what's-his-face-istan.

02:37.491 --> 02:41.128
My name is Sergei
Berdimuhamedov,

02:41.161 --> 02:43.797
and that is my luggage.

02:43.831 --> 02:46.967
The Russian competitors bond
with their local hosts.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.169
Oh, hey, cool screen saver.

02:49.203 --> 02:51.171
I'm still sticking
with Flying Toasters.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.907
No, no, that's my Internet
girlfriend.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.676
Don't worry.
She can't see us.

02:55.709 --> 02:59.713
I don't turn the camera on
unless I'm wearing my baby mask.

02:59.747 --> 03:01.415
Well, if you
love this horse,

03:01.449 --> 03:03.817
why do you hide your face?
FRANK:
We may hide our faces,

03:03.851 --> 03:07.821
but that just makes it easier
to bare our souls.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.323
And one time when we were drunk,

03:09.357 --> 03:12.560
she showed me one of her boobs,
so I showed her one of mine.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.863
Another thing we have
in common: nice cans.

03:15.896 --> 03:18.266
And no sooner had the
pleasantries been exchanged,

03:18.299 --> 03:19.667
when cultural differences

03:19.700 --> 03:23.337
rose to a level
not seen since Rocky IV.

03:23.371 --> 03:27.174
I am Svetlana,
and this is my daughter Dasha.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.676
Welcome.
Look at these

03:28.709 --> 03:30.711
pathetic Americans.

03:30.744 --> 03:34.348
Hey.
They are soft
like pierogi dough.

03:34.382 --> 03:36.584
And they are so tiny.

03:36.617 --> 03:39.353
We would feed this
to ox and hope

03:39.387 --> 03:41.289
for strong baby next time.

03:41.322 --> 03:44.292
Get the bags, Dasha!
Oh. No, no, no.

03:44.325 --> 03:47.561
Hey, listen, we can...
help with... (yelps)

03:47.595 --> 03:49.563
Don't help her!

03:49.597 --> 03:51.365
We can help with...
(grunts)

03:51.399 --> 03:52.700
(upbeat dance music playing)

03:52.733 --> 03:54.568
While some athletes
were all business,

03:54.602 --> 03:58.406
others were eager
for some fun and games.

03:58.439 --> 04:01.041
Hey, Frank, does this club
at the bowling alley

04:01.074 --> 04:03.444
have a dress code?

04:04.345 --> 04:06.480
WOMAN:
And after he pushed me

04:06.514 --> 04:07.881
into the reptile enclosure,

04:07.915 --> 04:10.884
I was never able to trust
another man again.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.621
Aw, that is, until now.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.289
(Frank sneezes)

04:15.323 --> 04:16.890
Is there somebody else there
with you?

04:16.924 --> 04:18.292
(sneezes)

04:18.326 --> 04:19.927
An allergic reaction
to the Russian cologne,

04:19.960 --> 04:24.231
Chernobyl Breeze, sends Frank
into a sneezing fit.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.934
Oh, man. Are you okay?

04:26.967 --> 04:29.102
I can call 911!

04:29.136 --> 04:32.340
(sneezes, gasping)

04:33.273 --> 04:35.743
Oh, my God.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.946
Horse-head is Shelley?

04:38.979 --> 04:41.114
Hello?

04:41.148 --> 04:43.484
Hello? Are you okay?

04:43.517 --> 04:45.252
So, I've had sex with horse

04:45.285 --> 04:47.254
and I've had sex with woman,

04:47.287 --> 04:50.758
but I've never had sex
with hybrid horse-woman.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.192
(chuckles)

04:52.225 --> 04:55.262
While the rest of Natesville
adapts to their foreign guests,

04:55.295 --> 04:57.598
Barney Hughes learns
that Americans

04:57.631 --> 04:59.667
can be just as surprising.

04:59.700 --> 05:00.968
Hey, guys!

05:01.001 --> 05:03.671
You have time for a few pictures
with your biggest fan?

05:03.704 --> 05:05.539
(gasps)

05:05.573 --> 05:08.476
BRETT:
Could you close
the door, Barney?

05:08.509 --> 05:11.479
We're busy doping.
Uh, uh...

05:11.512 --> 05:14.281
Um... Uh, uh,
you can't use this footage

05:14.314 --> 05:16.484
if there's nudity, right?

05:19.152 --> 05:23.691
You're just covering this
with a graphic, aren't you?

05:30.531 --> 05:32.466
NARRATOR:
As the sun rises on Natesville,

05:32.500 --> 05:35.903
it sets on a disgraced
and disqualified American team,

05:35.936 --> 05:38.639
whose doping antics
have left their hopes

05:38.672 --> 05:42.342
as shriveled
as their testicles.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.982
Just when it appeared
that being from Natesville

05:49.016 --> 05:52.653
was going to suck a little bit
more than usual, Barney Hughes

05:52.686 --> 05:54.321
makes a discovery
that could change

05:54.354 --> 05:55.989
the course
of the Grocery Games.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.991
This is kind of interesting.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.093
"If any competitor cannot
partake in the Games,

06:00.127 --> 06:04.432
replacements may be chosen by
the manager of the host store."

06:04.465 --> 06:05.899
Emphasis on "kind of."

06:05.933 --> 06:08.869
There are much more
interesting books out there.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.070
Remind me
to lend you

06:10.103 --> 06:11.539
some Danielle Steel.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.441
Sounds like you should get
in touch with the runners-up

06:13.474 --> 06:14.608
from the U.S. championships.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.510
Forget that. You
guys should do it.

06:16.544 --> 06:17.778
(chuckles)
How often

06:17.811 --> 06:19.346
do you get
to represent your nation?

06:19.379 --> 06:20.948
On a world stage?

06:20.981 --> 06:24.718
On a channel that reaches over
three percent of American TVs?

06:24.752 --> 06:26.854
Oh, but we wouldn't
stand a chance.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.188
Yeah, Barney's right.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.424
All right, the Russian team
is made up of professionals.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.092
We just do this for a living.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.528
Guys. Come on.

06:34.562 --> 06:37.397
This is your chance to shine.

06:37.431 --> 06:38.699
Besides,
don't you think

06:38.732 --> 06:40.367
it would be nice
for Natesville to be known

06:40.400 --> 06:43.036
for something other
than that mysterious hum?

06:43.070 --> 06:45.072
Or the kazoo-testing facility?

06:45.105 --> 06:47.040
SABRINA:
Actually, I wasn't
really listening.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.910
I had a... itch on my neck,
and I was trying to scratch it

06:49.943 --> 06:51.879
with the tag on the back of
my shirt by nodding like...

06:51.912 --> 06:54.715
JIMMY:
Yeah, I wasn't nodding either.

06:54.748 --> 06:55.883
One of my favorite songs just...

06:55.916 --> 06:57.918
came on in my head,
and I was just

06:57.951 --> 06:59.553
bopping along to it.

06:59.587 --> 07:01.088
* Get it, get it, get it,
get it, pull my taffy, boys *

07:01.121 --> 07:02.723
* Pull my taffy, boys.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.559
Don't you think we need a reason
to hold our heads high?

07:05.593 --> 07:06.960
Besides being
the only town

07:06.994 --> 07:09.730
in the United States
to surrender to the Japanese

07:09.763 --> 07:11.331
the day after Pearl Harbor?

07:11.364 --> 07:12.633
BARNEY:
Sometimes I think

07:12.666 --> 07:14.267
if I concentrate hard enough,

07:14.301 --> 07:16.504
I can make the clock go faster.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.305
And what
about the kids?

07:18.338 --> 07:19.773
We could do it for the kids,

07:19.807 --> 07:20.741
the future

07:20.774 --> 07:21.742
of Natesville.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.911
FRANK:
I looked like I was agreeing,

07:23.944 --> 07:27.114
but sometimes when I'm bored,
I pretend I'm a Pez dispenser.

07:27.147 --> 07:32.285
We're the town that voted
to make our official bird

07:32.319 --> 07:33.687
the middle finger.

07:33.721 --> 07:34.988
Well, winning this
would be

07:35.022 --> 07:36.757
like giving a middle finger
to the world.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.626
BURT:
I didn't even hear
what she was saying.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.460
It's just when she gets
behind something,

07:40.494 --> 07:42.429
she gets so passionate and hot.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.632
That year she got behind
Ruben Studdard on Idol,

07:44.665 --> 07:47.200
we had so much sex
it was crazy.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.102
Aren't you sick
of being laughed at?

07:49.136 --> 07:51.471
(woman giggling,
man laughing)

07:51.505 --> 07:53.941
NARRATOR:
Virginia's speech may have been
falling on deaf ears,

07:53.974 --> 07:56.610
but someone else's ears
were being filled

07:56.644 --> 07:57.711
with sweet nothings.

07:57.745 --> 08:00.180
MAXIM:
Oh, I feel so sorry

08:00.213 --> 08:02.850
for this puny
American cucumber.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.618
It's so small
it could not satisfy

08:04.652 --> 08:07.220
anyone's appetite
for anything.

08:07.254 --> 08:11.291
In Russia,
cucumbers are much bigger.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.961
I'm not big on
vegetables, so...

08:13.994 --> 08:16.564
I hope you're talking
about penises.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.066
Of course I was.
(chuckles)

08:19.099 --> 08:21.501
Da.
(chuckles)

08:21.535 --> 08:23.704
So who's in?

08:26.106 --> 08:27.708
I knew it.

08:27.741 --> 08:31.011
I knew you were all just nodding
for your own personal reasons.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.847
I'm in.

08:33.881 --> 08:34.848
Just like Rebecca

08:34.882 --> 08:36.684
never gave up
on her ex-husband Paul

08:36.717 --> 08:39.386
in Danielle Steel's
Matters of the Heart,

08:39.419 --> 08:41.655
I'm not giving up on America.

08:41.689 --> 08:44.224
Never thought
I'd say this...

08:44.257 --> 08:47.194
but Frank here's my guy.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.896
Who else is with us?

08:48.929 --> 08:51.932
Well, after Frank volunteered,
we kind of had to.

08:51.965 --> 08:55.202
I mean, he is officially the
laziest guy in the store.

08:55.235 --> 08:59.673
Barney does superlatives
in the annual Howdy's yearbook.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.041
At first I was scared
to do this,

09:01.074 --> 09:03.510
but the more I thought
about it, I realized

09:03.543 --> 09:06.113
I don't have a fancy,
glamorous life.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.447
I work in a grocery store.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.117
I'm sick of getting my glory
piece by piece.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.285
I want my glory whole!

09:12.319 --> 09:16.123
NARRATOR:
Can this ragtag group
of underdogs

09:16.156 --> 09:18.558
really take
on the Russian superstars?

09:18.592 --> 09:20.460
Find out after these messages.

09:20.493 --> 09:21.895
Then at 8:30,

09:21.929 --> 09:24.197
stay tuned
for Sample Ladies After Dark.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.967
This week a fat guy gets busted

09:27.000 --> 09:29.803
for taking more than his share
of cheese cubes.

09:35.508 --> 09:37.945
NARRATOR:
With only one day to prepare
and half of that

09:37.978 --> 09:40.380
spent buying
matching sweat suits,

09:40.413 --> 09:42.382
Team U.S.A. embarks on a series

09:42.415 --> 09:45.485
of nontraditional
training exercises

09:45.518 --> 09:47.587
set to up-tempo music.

09:47.621 --> 09:50.290
(up-tempo music playing)

09:50.323 --> 09:53.727
(whirring)

09:53.761 --> 09:55.696
(chicken clucking)

10:10.277 --> 10:11.679
Go.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.213
What are you doing?

10:14.014 --> 10:15.248
Use the slicer.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.583
On his deathbed, I shook

10:16.616 --> 10:18.618
my grandfather's thumb-less hand

10:18.652 --> 10:20.453
and promised him
I'd be the first Marolla

10:20.487 --> 10:21.955
to die with ten fingers.

10:21.989 --> 10:24.191
But, Frank, it's gonna take
an hour to fill the platter.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.126
I'll tell you
what I tell the customers:

10:26.159 --> 10:29.229
you can have it fast
or you can have it finger-free.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.600
While the team is busy
training, food lines

10:33.633 --> 10:35.202
are forming.

10:35.235 --> 10:36.670
Some citizens of Natesville,

10:36.704 --> 10:39.439
used to a heavy diet
of processed lunch meat,

10:39.472 --> 10:40.941
begin to lose their cool.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.943
Who do you got to sleep with
in this place

10:42.976 --> 10:45.679
to get a half a pound
of olive loaf?!

10:50.550 --> 10:52.953
(whirring)

10:52.986 --> 10:56.223
Hey, that-that's
a health code v...

10:56.256 --> 10:58.058
(beeping)

11:06.266 --> 11:08.168
He's a natural.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.645
NARRATOR:
After being lost
in the darkness for so long,

11:18.678 --> 11:22.015
the team sees a ray of light.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.188
(beep)

11:29.289 --> 11:32.025
Why didn't you tell me
Burt could do all this?

11:34.194 --> 11:35.863
I didn't know.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.171
Wait!
Burt!

11:44.204 --> 11:48.508
Burt, you're the best pure
grocer I've ever seen.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.609
Please join us.

11:49.642 --> 11:51.278
We need you to
save our team.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.679
Sorry, Barney.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.248
I don't do things
that make me look foolish.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.729
NARRATOR:
After a brief investigation,

12:09.763 --> 12:11.431
The Supermarket Channel
finds the reason

12:11.464 --> 12:13.033
for Burt's reluctance.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.869
I knew it was only a matter
of time before this came out.

12:15.903 --> 12:18.205
What did you find,
the pictures?

12:18.238 --> 12:20.240
Yeah, I used to work
at Howdy's.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.609
I worked there
long before Barney ever did.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.477
It was simple--
hours were good,

12:24.511 --> 12:26.213
beer was easy to steal.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.715
It was all gravy

12:28.748 --> 12:31.451
till Free Balloon Day.

12:31.484 --> 12:34.221
One kid let his balloon
slip away.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.624
The string was hanging there,
just out of reach.

12:37.657 --> 12:39.827
I couldn't stand
to see a kid lose something

12:39.860 --> 12:41.061
he loved so much.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.263
So I pulled a shopping cart over

12:43.296 --> 12:45.765
and climbed on
so I could get it down.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.667
The cart shifted.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.569
(breath quivering)

12:49.602 --> 12:51.071
The cart shifted.

12:51.104 --> 12:54.407
This is Dave Davidson
reporting from Howdy's Market

12:54.441 --> 12:56.076
on Free Balloon Day.

12:56.109 --> 12:59.146
But this day of inflated
expectations has ended

12:59.179 --> 13:01.781
in tragedy
for one unlucky stock boy,

13:01.815 --> 13:06.353
and pure joy for the rest of us
because it is...

13:06.386 --> 13:07.687
(laughter)
it's hilarious.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.156
Stop laughing at me.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.357
(laughter)

13:10.390 --> 13:11.959
Stop laughing at me!

13:11.992 --> 13:13.760
(distant):
The cart shifted.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.628
Stop laughing at me!
I'm stuck!

13:15.662 --> 13:16.796
(laughter)

13:16.830 --> 13:18.298
Back to you, Stu.

13:18.331 --> 13:22.235
The firemen had to use
the jaws of life to cut me out.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.873
And it was then
I promised myself,

13:25.906 --> 13:29.910
I would never be laughed at
in a grocery store again.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.146
Never.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.115
NARRATOR:
With little hope of victory,

13:35.148 --> 13:38.518
spirits were
at an all-time low.

13:40.187 --> 13:41.955
Hey, Frank.

13:41.989 --> 13:44.324
You know the front door
of the store is locked?

13:44.357 --> 13:46.793
I was supposed to unlock it.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.897
Yet another job I suck at.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.832
Frank, what's wrong?

13:52.866 --> 13:54.567
And can I have that roast beef?

13:54.601 --> 13:56.569
The Russians.

13:56.603 --> 13:57.971
They take your food,

13:58.005 --> 14:00.473
they're gonna take
Barney's trophy,

14:00.507 --> 14:01.741
and they took my Shelley.

14:01.774 --> 14:02.976
You and Shelley are a thing?

14:03.010 --> 14:05.345
It's the age-old romantic story.

14:05.378 --> 14:09.182
Boy wearing baby mask meets girl
wearing horse-head mask.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.551
And then girl's
mask comes off,

14:11.584 --> 14:12.920
and boy doesn't have the guts

14:12.953 --> 14:15.822
to tell her
how he really feels about her.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.857
We've all seen it
a million times.

14:17.891 --> 14:20.693
Maybe she'd be happy
if she knew it was you.

14:20.727 --> 14:22.162
Come on, Burt.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.431
The second most beautiful girl
in Natesville

14:24.464 --> 14:27.100
doesn't want the third
hottest guy in Natesville.

14:27.134 --> 14:29.669
It doesn't work
that way, man.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.773
If we won the Grocery Games,
maybe I'd have a shot with her.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.175
Maybe your team will win.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.945
Not a chance.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.113
We're gonna lose,

14:40.147 --> 14:43.083
and I'm gonna lose
the one thing I care about.

14:50.890 --> 14:54.394
23. Tighten those butt
cheeks, Sabriner. 24.

14:54.427 --> 14:55.528
I quit.

14:55.562 --> 14:56.696
Oh, my God!
Thank God.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.131
Now I can finally
quit, too.

14:58.165 --> 15:00.367
Oh, me, too. No offense, Frank,
but I only did this

15:00.400 --> 15:02.535
because I didn't want
to seem lamer than you.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.871
BURT:
Nobody's quitting.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.473
Oh, crap.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.375
I'm joining the team, and
we're gonna win this thing.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.642
Oh. Thanks, Burt.

15:09.676 --> 15:10.710
I'm not doing it
for you, Barney.

15:10.743 --> 15:11.811
I'm doing it for love.

15:11.844 --> 15:13.046
Oh, sweetie.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.247
Not your love, Virginia.

15:14.281 --> 15:16.149
Frank's love.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.424
NARRATOR:
Now that Team U.S.A. had
their ringer on board,

15:24.457 --> 15:27.660
captain Barney Hughes
devised a strategy for victory.

15:27.694 --> 15:30.063
We have a competition to win,
and we're gonna do that

15:30.097 --> 15:33.066
by having Burt run
the whole relay by himself.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.567
I'll run the first three legs,

15:34.601 --> 15:36.003
but Frank's pulling up the rear.

15:36.036 --> 15:39.139
Me? No. I'm the
worst one we've got.

15:39.172 --> 15:42.609
(whispering):
Look, Shelley needs
to see you as a winner.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.777
But the last leg
is the deli platter,

15:44.811 --> 15:46.779
and I'm horrible
at the slicer.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.581
Don't worry. I'll give you
such a huge lead,

15:48.615 --> 15:51.318
you'll have time to win the race
and tell Shelley you love her

15:51.351 --> 15:53.120
before the other team
is even finished.

15:53.153 --> 15:56.356
NARRATOR:
What looked like
a Grocery Games disaster

15:56.389 --> 15:59.026
when the American team
was disqualified

15:59.059 --> 16:01.594
is now set to be one
of the most exciting contests

16:01.628 --> 16:03.296
to date.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.465
(booing)

16:08.635 --> 16:11.004
I'd hit that.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.940
Let the games begin.

16:13.973 --> 16:18.078
NARRATOR:
Both teams are playing
for love of their country.

16:19.346 --> 16:23.650
But one participant is playing
for the country of love.

16:28.855 --> 16:31.224
(gun chamber clicks, gunshot)

16:31.258 --> 16:32.959
While Sergei uses
the traditional technique

16:32.992 --> 16:36.696
of gathering all five carts,

16:36.729 --> 16:38.131
Burt uses
a single-cart strategy

16:38.165 --> 16:41.168
never before seen
in competition.

16:55.048 --> 16:57.517
(applause and cheering)

16:57.550 --> 16:59.819
Can-stacking is usually
a tedious event

16:59.852 --> 17:01.488
where individual cans

17:01.521 --> 17:04.224
are removed from cases
and placed on a shelf.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.093
They say that
by the last case,

17:06.126 --> 17:08.561
each can feels like
it weighs a thousand pounds.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.197
What the hell
is he doing?

17:10.230 --> 17:11.664
You told him he has to take the
cans out of the boxes, right?

17:11.698 --> 17:13.166
I tried to,
but every time

17:13.200 --> 17:16.002
I said the word
"cans," he giggled.
(giggles)

17:16.035 --> 17:17.437
NARRATOR:
But while everyone thought

17:17.470 --> 17:20.207
Burt was leaving the cans
in the box,

17:20.240 --> 17:23.376
he was actually thinking
outside the box.

17:25.078 --> 17:27.680
(woman gasps)

17:27.714 --> 17:31.251
(applause and cheering)

17:32.385 --> 17:34.387
After shattering
the world record

17:34.421 --> 17:37.124
in the can-stacking
competition,

17:37.157 --> 17:41.094
Burt is on his way
to bagging the championship.

17:46.433 --> 17:49.236
As Burt finishes the third leg
of the relay,

17:49.269 --> 17:53.206
the Russian team has barely
begun stacking cans.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.607
BURT:
Go!
(applause)

17:54.641 --> 17:57.744
Go! Go! Go!
Go, Frank!

18:02.849 --> 18:04.083
Oh, good Lord!

18:04.117 --> 18:06.586
Use the slicer, you wimp!

18:10.690 --> 18:14.427
NARRATOR:
As Frank meticulously moves
from salami to pressed ham,

18:14.461 --> 18:17.164
his teammates offer words
of encouragement.

18:17.197 --> 18:18.798
BARNEY:
That's enough ham,

18:18.831 --> 18:20.667
Frank! Cut the cheese!

18:20.700 --> 18:22.169
(giggles)

18:25.305 --> 18:27.274
What's the matter, baby face?

18:27.307 --> 18:30.343
You afraid of big,
bad deli-slicer, huh?

18:30.377 --> 18:31.478
No.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.613
(whirring)

18:38.885 --> 18:41.821
NARRATOR:
Overcoming his fear,
Marolla puts his heart

18:41.854 --> 18:44.324
and his fingers on the line.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.758
Marolla's
gonna slice!

18:45.792 --> 18:47.460
Marolla's
gonna slice!
(gasps)

18:48.161 --> 18:51.198
(whirring)

19:15.755 --> 19:17.224
Yes!

19:19.859 --> 19:23.062
NARRATOR:
Facing certain defeat,
Maxim resorts

19:23.095 --> 19:26.433
to an age-old
Russian tactic-- cheating.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.671
(sneezing)

19:34.507 --> 19:36.909
(sneezing)

19:36.943 --> 19:38.144
I knew I'd heard
that sneeze before.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.280
(sneezing)

19:40.847 --> 19:41.848
(sneezing)

19:41.881 --> 19:42.815
Oh!
(gasps)

19:42.849 --> 19:44.183
Hurry, Frank.

19:44.217 --> 19:47.254
He's right behind you!

19:48.921 --> 19:50.790
(sneezing)

19:51.558 --> 19:54.394
(audience groaning and gasping)

19:55.462 --> 19:56.363
(yelling)

19:56.396 --> 19:59.266
(laughter and
cheering)

20:03.936 --> 20:05.772
(scattered applause)

20:05.805 --> 20:07.840
BARNEY:
So close.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.209
We were so close.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.419
You're the baby-head?

20:19.452 --> 20:21.187
Yeah.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.223
I know you're
probably disappointed.

20:24.257 --> 20:26.593
I was hoping if
we won, maybe...

20:26.626 --> 20:27.960
You son of a bitch.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.195
What's that for?

20:29.228 --> 20:30.697
That's for not
video-chatting with me

20:30.730 --> 20:33.866
when I took off my mask,
and for making me feel ugly.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.868
Ugly?

20:35.902 --> 20:37.270
You're beautiful.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.872
I've always wanted
to ask you out.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.040
I was just...

20:41.073 --> 20:42.709
The thought of
it terrified me.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.445
You're like a
deli-slicer with boobs.

20:45.478 --> 20:49.248
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.753
(sighs)

20:53.786 --> 20:56.723
You guys tried real hard,
and you showed a lot of heart,

20:56.756 --> 20:59.492
but you managed to suck
just enough to lose.

20:59.526 --> 21:00.660
(laughs)

21:00.693 --> 21:03.062
(speaking Russian)

21:03.095 --> 21:04.964
Who do we appreciate?

21:04.997 --> 21:08.167
ALL:
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

21:08.200 --> 21:09.802
Yeah, well, you can take
your crummy cheer

21:09.836 --> 21:12.572
and your stupid trophy and stick
'em where the sun don't shine.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.907
Yeah, and then,
you can put 'em up your butts.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.309
NARRATOR:
And with that,

21:16.343 --> 21:18.645
Team U.S.A.
celebrated like champions,

21:18.678 --> 21:22.415
because this is America,
home of the moral victory.

21:22.449 --> 21:26.018
I know you and...
Ooh, tempting.

21:26.052 --> 21:27.420
(both laugh)

21:27.454 --> 21:28.755
Mmm.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.323
ANNOUNCER: Coming up next
on The Supermarket Channel,
