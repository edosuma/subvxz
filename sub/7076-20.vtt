WEBVTT

00:01.175 --> 00:03.410
Pierce, you made us all
drive out to a warehouse

00:03.477 --> 00:04.912
in the middle of nowhere.

00:04.978 --> 00:06.080
You could at least tell us why.

00:06.146 --> 00:07.081
Hey, I know as much as you.

00:07.147 --> 00:08.315
I got a letter

00:08.382 --> 00:09.917
from the executor of
my father's estate.

00:09.983 --> 00:11.919
It said to come out here with
my seven closest friends.

00:11.985 --> 00:13.153
You brought six.

00:13.220 --> 00:14.388
Well, who else was he gonna bring?

00:14.455 --> 00:15.722
Levar Burton was a maybe.

00:15.789 --> 00:17.157
Mr. Hawthorne.

00:17.224 --> 00:18.759
I apologize. - Gilbert.

00:18.826 --> 00:20.828
Even from the grave,
my father's got you

00:20.894 --> 00:23.097
by the short and curly salt and pepperies.

00:23.163 --> 00:25.399
My name is Gilbert Lawson.

00:25.466 --> 00:28.435
I was Cornelius Hawthorne's
assistant for over 30 years,

00:28.502 --> 00:30.270
and before that, I was just the teenager

00:30.337 --> 00:32.005
who read the Bible to him in the bath.

00:32.072 --> 00:33.006
- ew.
- All right, all right.

00:33.073 --> 00:34.141
It's inheritance time.

00:34.208 --> 00:36.310
How 'bout that check, soul brother?

00:36.376 --> 00:37.711
Your father did leave you something,

00:37.778 --> 00:39.446
but it's more of an activity.

00:39.513 --> 00:41.715
Thank you for keeping
it as creepy as possible.

00:41.782 --> 00:43.383
This looks like a
multi-Player gaming interface.

00:43.450 --> 00:44.418
I've heard enough.

00:44.485 --> 00:48.021
Oh, that diabolical old fossil face.

00:48.088 --> 00:50.424
I asked him for money
to invest in video games

00:50.491 --> 00:51.959
back in 1979.

00:52.025 --> 00:54.461
Cornelius spent over 30 years
developing a video game for you.

00:54.528 --> 00:56.563
It was his dying wish

00:56.630 --> 00:58.832
that you and seven of your
closest friends would play it.

00:58.899 --> 01:00.434
Lavar Burton was a maybe.

01:00.501 --> 01:02.069
So, please, choose a seat.

01:02.136 --> 01:03.437
Cool.

01:03.504 --> 01:06.940
So a 100-year-Old man designed
a 30-year-Old video game?

01:07.007 --> 01:08.208
This I've got to see.

01:08.275 --> 01:09.643
once you're seated
behind your computers,

01:09.710 --> 01:10.878
a photograph of you will be taken

01:10.944 --> 01:13.580
and an avatar will be
made from your likeness.

01:13.647 --> 01:14.982
I didn't bring my likeness.

01:16.650 --> 01:17.651
Don't smile.

01:17.718 --> 01:22.289
All right, everyone, let's begin.

01:27.561 --> 01:31.561
?T× ?T×

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:54.254 --> 01:55.556
- Nice!
- Cool.

01:55.622 --> 01:57.257
- Old school.
- Cool, cool, cool.

01:57.324 --> 01:59.326
Which one is me? I assume
nothing because I'm not racist.

01:59.393 --> 02:01.662
aww! We're adorable!

02:01.728 --> 02:03.130
Why did this thing take photos

02:03.197 --> 02:05.299
if it was going to completely
fabricate random body shapes?

02:05.365 --> 02:07.568
That's what I'm saying!
My hair looks good, though.

02:07.634 --> 02:09.636
Orange button is jump.

02:11.738 --> 02:13.107
Whee!

02:13.173 --> 02:14.475
Which guy am I?

02:14.541 --> 02:16.343
There's a door here.

02:17.444 --> 02:19.246
- Peace. Love.
- What's that?

02:19.313 --> 02:20.647
- I think it's a hippie.
- Peace. Love.

02:20.714 --> 02:21.682
aww!

02:21.749 --> 02:22.950
Annie, stop "Awing" everything.

02:23.016 --> 02:25.486
don't be jaded.
He's saying "Peace."

02:25.552 --> 02:26.920
Hello. - Sex.

02:26.987 --> 02:28.889
- Did he say "Sex"?
- Drugs. Sex.

02:28.956 --> 02:30.557
Oh, my god.

02:30.624 --> 02:31.558
hold on, I'm coming.

02:31.625 --> 02:33.894
- oh! Oh! Ow! Ow!
- Darn! Shoot!

02:33.961 --> 02:36.330
Dang it. Um-- - Jeff,
you just murdered Annie.

02:36.396 --> 02:37.798
Well, better than doing nothing!

02:37.865 --> 02:39.166
- I'm not sure that's the case.
- that's debatable.

02:39.233 --> 02:40.534
You guys, help me.

02:40.601 --> 02:42.469
- the way you helped Annie? - Sex.

02:42.536 --> 02:43.704
Before we engage,

02:43.771 --> 02:44.872
we should hang back and study their tactics.

02:44.938 --> 02:46.106
- What?
- Group sex.

02:46.173 --> 02:47.508
Oh, my god!

02:47.574 --> 02:50.043
Oh, cool, I'm alive.

02:50.110 --> 02:52.613
Pierce? - This game makes no sense.

02:52.679 --> 02:53.714
What happened to you?

02:53.781 --> 02:55.282
I don't want to talk about it.

02:55.349 --> 02:58.118
Pierce, point the joystick right.

02:58.185 --> 03:00.220
So I'm supposed
to just guess that?

03:00.287 --> 03:01.789
Where are the instructions?

03:03.590 --> 03:05.993
Take that! Take that! Yeah, we rule!

03:06.059 --> 03:07.227
Oh, you guys are alive.

03:07.294 --> 03:08.729
You re-Spawn in the
study room when you die.

03:08.796 --> 03:09.897
Here, I'll show you.

03:09.963 --> 03:11.865
- Hey!
- Jeffrey! Shame on you!

03:11.932 --> 03:14.134
"hang back and study their tactics"?

03:14.201 --> 03:15.202
Let him get it out of his system.

03:15.269 --> 03:17.805
Ah, forget it.
Let's just keep moving.

03:28.115 --> 03:29.183
Now what?

03:29.249 --> 03:31.218
Welcome to hawkthorne.

03:31.285 --> 03:33.487
that's dad's voice. Dad?

03:33.554 --> 03:35.656
Piercinald, in 1980,

03:35.722 --> 03:38.525
you said that video games,
not moist towelettes,

03:38.592 --> 03:40.160
were the business of the future.

03:40.227 --> 03:43.697
Today, moist towelettes are
stocked in every supermarket,

03:43.764 --> 03:46.166
while arcade after arcade closes.

03:46.233 --> 03:47.234
He's got a point.

03:47.301 --> 03:48.969
nevertheless, I designed this game

03:49.036 --> 03:50.370
to be played upon my death

03:50.437 --> 03:52.406
by you and whatever cabal of fruits,

03:52.473 --> 03:54.241
junkies, and sluts you call your friends.

03:54.308 --> 03:55.509
Her name is Britta.

03:55.576 --> 03:57.311
Only one player can win--

03:57.377 --> 04:00.481
The first to reach my throne
Inside castle hawkthorne.

04:00.547 --> 04:04.118
Their reward, Pierce,
will be your inheritance.

04:04.184 --> 04:05.385
- What?
- His inheritance? What?

04:05.452 --> 04:08.021
So you see, Pierce,
turns out you were right.

04:08.088 --> 04:10.190
Video games are important.

04:12.626 --> 04:14.895
Worst son ever!

04:14.962 --> 04:17.264
Well, great. How do I fight you guys?

04:17.331 --> 04:18.265
Which button fights?

04:18.332 --> 04:21.201
- Pierce, stop.
- Pierce, relax.

04:21.267 --> 04:22.669
Pierce, stay in the game,
stay in the game.

04:22.736 --> 04:23.837
Pierce, calm down.

04:23.904 --> 04:25.639
Nobody's gonna fight you.
Why not?

04:25.706 --> 04:27.908
Because when you're friends
with someone for three years,

04:27.975 --> 04:30.110
it's weird to steal their family's money.

04:30.177 --> 04:31.545
And there wouldn't be a
lot of sport in beating you.

04:31.612 --> 04:33.447
Look at yourself.
Yeah, he's right.

04:33.514 --> 04:35.449
You're playing the game wrong.

04:35.516 --> 04:37.484
Why is Harry belafonte in here?

04:37.551 --> 04:38.552
It's Gilbert.

04:38.619 --> 04:39.553
You're not supposed to cooperate,

04:39.620 --> 04:40.888
you're supposed to compete.

04:40.954 --> 04:42.122
Thanks for the advice,

04:42.189 --> 04:44.124
but I think we can choose
how we want to play.

04:44.191 --> 04:46.093
- I suppose we can. - is he
being ominous?

04:46.160 --> 04:47.594
Why are you being ominous?

04:49.163 --> 04:50.497
Whoa. We can pick stuff up?

04:50.564 --> 04:52.566
This game is more complex
than you can imagine.

04:52.633 --> 04:54.601
And aside from its programmers,

04:54.668 --> 04:56.270
who have all been deported back to China,

04:56.336 --> 04:58.839
I'm the one who knows how it works.

05:00.074 --> 05:01.208
Run, run!
He's gonna throw a knife!

05:01.275 --> 05:02.409
He's gonna throw a knife! Go!

05:02.476 --> 05:03.410
Jump! Jump!

05:05.379 --> 05:06.313
Wah!

05:09.116 --> 05:10.384
Wait! What are you--?

05:11.618 --> 05:13.554
he's a psychopath! He's suffo--

05:16.457 --> 05:17.991
Yeah.

05:18.058 --> 05:19.893
Hey, look, Buddy,
I know it must have sucked

05:19.960 --> 05:22.196
being colonel Sanders'
manservant and all,

05:22.262 --> 05:23.564
but Pierce is technically our friend,

05:23.630 --> 05:25.466
and we're not gonna watch
you screw him over.

05:25.532 --> 05:26.733
Perhaps you should be asking yourselves

05:26.800 --> 05:28.469
how you intend to stop me.

05:28.535 --> 05:31.004
How about if we come over
there and kick your ass?

05:31.071 --> 05:32.406
Go get him, Troy.

05:32.473 --> 05:33.507
Be my guest.

05:33.574 --> 05:35.342
But 30 seconds after you leave your chairs,

05:35.409 --> 05:37.144
the weight sensors will recognize it

05:37.211 --> 05:38.479
as an automatic forfeit.

05:38.545 --> 05:40.147
Weight sensors?

05:41.882 --> 05:43.150
That's it. Let's get that jag!

05:43.217 --> 05:44.451
- Yeah!
- Get him!

05:44.518 --> 05:47.755
- Kick that hippie's ass!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

05:47.821 --> 05:50.424
Let's go! Move, move, move!

05:52.993 --> 05:55.929
- I think he left a note.
- What?

05:55.996 --> 05:57.798
"after you've squandered
the last of your savings,

05:57.865 --> 05:59.266
"I'll watch you writhe,
penniless, in the gutter,

05:59.333 --> 06:00.400
"through a telescope
in the penthouse office

06:00.467 --> 06:01.401
of Hawthorne tower."

06:02.603 --> 06:05.839
you can leave notes.
This game is incredible.

06:05.906 --> 06:07.441
Pierce?

06:08.509 --> 06:09.443
- No, Pierce!
- Please, no!

06:09.510 --> 06:10.544
We need you!

06:10.611 --> 06:11.879
Just let me die.

06:11.945 --> 06:14.214
Pierce, so Gilbert knows a couple tricks.

06:14.281 --> 06:16.450
Big deal. We outnumber him.

06:16.517 --> 06:19.119
And most importantly,
while he's fighting for greed,

06:19.186 --> 06:20.854
we're fighting for friendship,

06:20.921 --> 06:23.157
which means we can't lose, okay?

06:23.223 --> 06:26.226
- Okay.
- Okay!

06:28.228 --> 06:30.564
I guess there's no hug button.

06:33.542 --> 06:36.278
Everybody keep Pierce protected.

06:36.345 --> 06:39.114
We have to get him to the throne
of hawkthorne before Gilbert.

06:39.181 --> 06:40.649
And don't forget, when you die,

06:40.716 --> 06:42.718
you go all the way back to the study room.

06:42.784 --> 06:44.686
So...don't die.

06:44.753 --> 06:46.388
Good pep talk, Jeff.

06:46.455 --> 06:47.889
Yeah, I used to love dying,

06:47.956 --> 06:49.558
but that speech really turned me around.

06:49.625 --> 06:50.892
Whatever.

06:52.928 --> 06:54.730
What's that? Kill it!

06:54.796 --> 06:56.365
It's a girl milking
a cow, Pierce.

06:56.431 --> 06:57.566
I'll check it out.
I owe Jeff that.

06:57.633 --> 07:00.068
I wasn't gonna say it.

07:00.135 --> 07:02.471
I am Hilda. I live in the village.

07:02.537 --> 07:04.106
- Lesbian.
- Shh!

07:06.508 --> 07:07.442
I can help with that.

07:07.509 --> 07:10.279
I have information on many topics.

07:10.345 --> 07:12.047
Cool.

07:13.582 --> 07:16.051
The throne is in castle
hawkthorne, north of here.

07:16.118 --> 07:19.021
You unlock the castle with the
white crystal of discipline,

07:19.087 --> 07:20.956
which you must free from the black caverns.

07:21.023 --> 07:22.791
I'm picking up on
some hidden symbolism.

07:22.858 --> 07:24.559
right, "White Crystal."

07:24.626 --> 07:25.994
You think dad was into meth?

07:26.061 --> 07:28.163
You can usually get
supplies in a town like this.

07:28.230 --> 07:29.631
Man, why can't my mom be here?

07:29.698 --> 07:31.566
She always said my video game
Knowledge would come in handy.

07:31.633 --> 07:33.302
I never believed her.

07:33.368 --> 07:34.670
Everybody split up and take a hut.

07:34.736 --> 07:38.736
Our only chance of beating
Gilbert is to cover more ground.

07:41.643 --> 07:44.313
I have information on
the following topics.

07:46.381 --> 07:47.349
Holy crap.

07:47.416 --> 07:49.318
Where have you been my whole life?

07:51.386 --> 07:53.522
I buy and sell weapons and armor.

07:54.590 --> 07:56.024
Cool. We need weapons.

07:57.092 --> 07:59.761
ooh. Well, what's free?

07:59.828 --> 08:00.796
Can we have a torch?

08:00.862 --> 08:02.531
- Thief! Thief! - Annie, put it
back.

08:02.598 --> 08:04.866
Sorry. Sorry.

08:04.933 --> 08:06.201
Arr! Arr!

08:06.268 --> 08:07.202
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

08:07.269 --> 08:08.403
Oh, my god. - Oh, oh! Oh, no!

08:08.470 --> 08:10.439
What are you doing? - It was an accident!

08:10.505 --> 08:11.773
- Arrr!
- He's dying!

08:11.840 --> 08:13.075
- Arrrrrr! - All right, hold on,
hold on!

08:13.141 --> 08:14.876
Arrr! Arrr!

08:14.943 --> 08:16.445
Now what are you doing?

08:16.511 --> 08:17.846
He was suffering!

08:17.913 --> 08:20.148
Yeah, from axe wounds!

08:20.215 --> 08:22.284
Well, if this isn't
worth any points, what is?

08:22.351 --> 08:25.454
You're asking me?
I'm still looking for a pong paddle.

08:25.520 --> 08:29.291
- Let's play poker. - Oh, now we're talking.

08:29.358 --> 08:31.126
Check the desk.
I'll check the dresser.

08:31.193 --> 08:32.394
How do I straighten that painting?

08:32.461 --> 08:35.230
You can't.
Stop playing like a girl.

08:37.532 --> 08:38.799
Stop playing like a girl?

08:38.866 --> 08:40.769
Here's the thing about women, Jeff.

08:40.836 --> 08:42.904
We don't Hack and slash
our way through life

08:42.971 --> 08:45.140
because we're one with life.

08:45.207 --> 08:48.043
- Help me hide the body. - Oh,
my lord. Oh, my lord.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.345
Shirley, these things
happen in video games.

08:50.412 --> 08:51.513
- They do?
- Yes.

08:51.580 --> 08:52.514
We can't get hung up

08:52.581 --> 08:53.849
on Real world morality.

08:53.916 --> 08:55.350
We need to survive and win.

08:55.417 --> 08:58.353
Hello, I'm the
blacksmith's wife--Aah! Help!

08:58.420 --> 09:00.289
- Oh, crap!
- Guard the door.

09:00.355 --> 09:01.723
What?

09:01.790 --> 09:02.724
Shirley!

09:02.791 --> 09:04.426
No witnesses!

09:04.493 --> 09:05.761
Grab everything you can carry.

09:05.827 --> 09:07.296
I'll check upstairs
for any more family.

09:07.362 --> 09:09.064
Don't give me that look.
These are your loose ends.

09:09.131 --> 09:10.632
I'm just tying 'em up.

09:10.699 --> 09:12.401
This is so cool.

09:12.467 --> 09:13.635
Where are your clothes?

09:13.702 --> 09:14.870
Pierce taught me poker.

09:14.937 --> 09:16.405
I'm not good at it.

09:16.471 --> 09:17.439
You still talking to this girl?

09:17.506 --> 09:18.840
Yeah, she only has three moves

09:18.907 --> 09:20.676
that you activate with
basic patterns of stimulus.

09:20.742 --> 09:22.110
I've never felt this way before.

09:22.177 --> 09:23.845
- Abed, don't get weird. - Oh, I won't.

09:23.912 --> 09:24.980
She's not ready for
anything serious,

09:25.047 --> 09:26.548
but she wants me to meet her family.

09:26.615 --> 09:29.017
- My father is the blacksmith.
- her father's a blacksmith.

09:29.084 --> 09:31.486
- Hello!
- Everybody go shopping?

09:31.553 --> 09:33.422
That's all we did.

09:33.488 --> 09:34.523
Is that hut on fire?

09:34.590 --> 09:37.759
Oh, my. What an unexplained tragedy.

09:37.826 --> 09:40.362
don't we look
comfy at a cauldron.

09:40.429 --> 09:41.964
check it out.

09:43.765 --> 09:45.634
Ooh, see, I'll put
all of this in here,

09:45.701 --> 09:47.736
and then that,
and then I'll hit this.

09:47.803 --> 09:49.404
What is it?

09:49.471 --> 09:51.073
I assume, like, a strength potion.

09:51.139 --> 09:52.641
Then I assume it's poison.

09:52.708 --> 09:54.276
You're just jealous
because we found a world

09:54.343 --> 09:55.577
where I know what I'm doing.

09:55.644 --> 09:57.946
This place is 20 cat
turds and a pixies poster

09:58.013 --> 09:59.615
from being your apartment.

10:02.017 --> 10:03.418
What's with the st. Pauli girl?

10:03.485 --> 10:04.486
Hilda's parents lived there.

10:04.553 --> 10:05.754
Now she has no family.

10:05.821 --> 10:07.155
She'll be forced to
marry a male villager

10:07.222 --> 10:09.725
or take her chances in the wilderness.

10:09.791 --> 10:12.294
What kind of game is this?

10:12.361 --> 10:14.496
Oh, crap, it's Gilbert.
Well, well, well.

10:14.563 --> 10:16.265
Looks like someone's
one step behind.

10:16.331 --> 10:18.667
Yeah, if you're looking
for equipment, tough luck.

10:18.734 --> 10:21.303
The store was lost in a freak accident.

10:21.370 --> 10:22.704
I hardly need equipment, young lady.

10:22.771 --> 10:25.841
While you were shopping,
I gained enough levels to do this.

10:25.907 --> 10:27.743
Uh-Huh, come on and bring it!

10:27.809 --> 10:29.177
He's shooting lightning and I'm naked!

10:29.244 --> 10:30.445
Get behind us! We have armor!

10:30.512 --> 10:31.947
Oh! Whoa!

10:32.014 --> 10:34.750
Aah!

10:34.816 --> 10:36.685
Oh, great! Gilbert!

10:36.752 --> 10:39.254
Oh, great! Evil Jedi lightning Gilbert!

10:39.321 --> 10:40.856
oh!

10:40.923 --> 10:44.126
Britta, drink that super
strength potion you made.

10:44.192 --> 10:45.260
Oh, right, right, right, right.

10:45.327 --> 10:46.461
Hurry up, Britta!

10:46.528 --> 10:47.996
I'm trying, I'm trying! Aah!

10:48.063 --> 10:50.065
Damn it, I thought we
could count on Britta

10:50.132 --> 10:52.034
to not screw up drinking.

10:52.100 --> 10:53.402
This'll be fun.

10:55.037 --> 10:57.005
what the hell?

10:57.072 --> 10:58.373
Here's hoping we can count on her

10:58.440 --> 11:00.309
to screw up making potions.

11:07.950 --> 11:09.451
Unbelievable.

11:09.518 --> 11:12.154
Jeff bet all our lives on Britta and won,

11:12.220 --> 11:15.424
and I lost my pants to a pair of nines.

11:19.861 --> 11:22.397
very well.

11:22.464 --> 11:25.200
Let's play.

11:34.067 --> 11:35.802
Abed, are you sure about this?

11:35.868 --> 11:38.071
Yeah. It just feels like
the right thing to do.

11:38.137 --> 11:39.772
Hey, I made it back.

11:39.839 --> 11:41.941
You guys never died.
How did you beat Gilbert?

11:42.008 --> 11:44.010
Oh, you know. Teamwork.

11:44.077 --> 11:45.044
We were headed for the black caves

11:45.111 --> 11:46.446
to find the white crystal.

11:46.512 --> 11:47.814
We were just saying good-Bye to abed.

11:47.880 --> 11:48.982
I'm gonna stay here in
the village with Hilda

11:49.048 --> 11:50.083
and help her rebuild her life.

11:50.149 --> 11:51.718
Abed, she's a program.

11:51.784 --> 11:53.519
People have said similar things about me.

11:53.586 --> 11:55.154
Uh-Oh. He's playing
the rain man card.

11:55.221 --> 11:56.155
Let's bounce.

11:56.222 --> 11:57.757
I've got an inheritance to win.

12:00.827 --> 12:02.161
?T× ?T×

12:03.763 --> 12:05.265
Offensive. Called it.

12:05.331 --> 12:06.266
Shut up, Britta.

12:06.332 --> 12:08.468
?T× ?T×

12:09.836 --> 12:11.471
You did great in there, Jeff.

12:11.537 --> 12:12.605
Shut up, Pierce.

12:15.942 --> 12:17.210
?T× ?T×

12:17.277 --> 12:19.812
Okay, duck. Stay ducked.

12:19.879 --> 12:21.514
Okay, unduck.

12:21.581 --> 12:23.316
Okay, now jump.

12:23.383 --> 12:24.584
I think we're almost there.

12:24.651 --> 12:27.020
Thank god. This cave is the worst.

12:27.086 --> 12:28.688
I know, I don't know
what's more offensive--

12:28.755 --> 12:31.124
The actual racism or the insulting notion

12:31.190 --> 12:32.792
that it might somehow rub off on us.

12:33.860 --> 12:35.061
look out! Jive turkeys!

12:35.128 --> 12:36.829
Kill them before they start multiplying!

12:38.798 --> 12:41.868
- Yeah, suck on this! - Take
that, jive turkey!

12:48.741 --> 12:49.976
All right! The White crystal!

12:50.043 --> 12:50.977
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

12:51.044 --> 12:51.978
- Get it!
- Get it!

12:52.045 --> 12:53.046
I'll take it.

12:53.112 --> 12:56.382
I've earned it by having friends.

12:58.651 --> 12:59.585
This is it.

13:00.653 --> 13:01.587
It certainly is.

13:01.654 --> 13:03.122
- No, man!
- You again?

13:03.189 --> 13:04.123
Now I'll have that crystal.

13:04.190 --> 13:05.124
I think you'll have this.

13:06.192 --> 13:07.160
whoops.

13:07.226 --> 13:08.494
Arrows!

13:09.929 --> 13:11.431
What? Come on!

13:13.766 --> 13:14.801
Where'd you get all that stuff?

13:14.867 --> 13:16.669
You've only been alive for an hour.

13:22.241 --> 13:23.176
Well, that was not fair.

13:23.242 --> 13:24.410
What the hell, Gilbert?

13:24.477 --> 13:27.113
You're cheating,
which I have no problem with,

13:27.180 --> 13:29.048
but you're getting caught,
and that's not cool!

13:29.115 --> 13:30.049
Yeah, don't be a knob.

13:30.116 --> 13:31.951
That inheritance is rightfully mine!

13:32.018 --> 13:33.453
Rightfully?

13:33.519 --> 13:34.587
I'm his son.

13:34.654 --> 13:39.258
- So am I.
- Oh.

13:39.325 --> 13:42.028
What? That can't be True.

13:42.095 --> 13:45.231
You're half...white. - Nice save.

13:45.298 --> 13:47.567
Do you remember your
childhood nanny, Etta?

13:47.634 --> 13:51.037
Well, Etta had a hot cousin.

13:51.104 --> 13:52.705
My mother.

13:52.772 --> 13:55.275
So you see, Pierce,

13:55.341 --> 13:57.877
I am your half-Brother,

13:57.944 --> 14:00.647
and I am more your father's
son than you ever were,

14:00.713 --> 14:03.316
so shut up and play the game.

14:03.383 --> 14:06.386
Why you-- - Let's go, Pierce.

14:08.288 --> 14:10.223
Okay, look, I know things seem hopeless

14:10.290 --> 14:12.325
because he's all the way to
the castle with the crystal

14:12.392 --> 14:13.893
and we're starting over,

14:13.960 --> 14:15.328
but here's the thing--

14:15.395 --> 14:16.829
We're better at this game now.

14:16.896 --> 14:19.632
We've died and been reborn,
and that makes us heroes.

14:20.700 --> 14:21.901
- Charge!
- Let's get him!

14:29.976 --> 14:33.976
?T× ?T×

14:41.154 --> 14:42.422
I guess the fact that
we're still playing

14:42.488 --> 14:43.756
means he hasn't won yet.

14:43.823 --> 14:45.291
Yeah, but what's the point?

14:45.358 --> 14:47.794
He'll just keep
cheating until he wins.

14:47.860 --> 14:50.630
Why are all the trees cut down?

14:50.697 --> 14:55.335
Isn't this where abed's village was?

14:55.401 --> 14:57.337
- Hello, old friends.
- abed!

14:57.403 --> 14:58.404
You remember Hilda.

14:58.471 --> 15:00.974
I live in the village. I love abed.

15:01.040 --> 15:02.542
Did she just say your name?

15:02.609 --> 15:04.043
Yeah, if you Max out a character's trust

15:04.110 --> 15:05.345
and affection levels, you can gain access

15:05.411 --> 15:06.446
to a front-End scripting language.

15:06.512 --> 15:07.447
Watch.

15:10.149 --> 15:11.651
Cool cool cool!

15:11.718 --> 15:13.019
She can make babies for me.

15:13.086 --> 15:14.020
Oh, and I can't?

15:14.087 --> 15:15.688
I can't.

15:15.755 --> 15:16.823
Come on inside.

15:16.889 --> 15:17.824
I built this from scratch.

15:17.890 --> 15:18.825
Check out my castle.

15:18.891 --> 15:19.826
- Oh, it's nice.
- Wow.

15:19.892 --> 15:21.027
I hope this isn't blood gold.

15:21.094 --> 15:22.328
This is my family.

15:22.395 --> 15:24.097
Baby abed has my eyes and her bonnet.

15:24.163 --> 15:25.898
Each baby is capable of
executing custom code,

15:25.965 --> 15:27.200
which means you can write a code

15:27.267 --> 15:29.035
that makes one baby tell
another baby what to do,

15:29.102 --> 15:30.670
much like real children on a playground.

15:30.737 --> 15:32.038
Oh, abed, but--

15:32.105 --> 15:33.706
Annie, let's find the
tin man's heart later.

15:33.773 --> 15:35.608
Abed, how much stuff do you have here

15:35.675 --> 15:36.676
and what can we make with it?

15:36.743 --> 15:38.645
- That depends.
- on?

15:38.711 --> 15:40.446
On what you can imagine.

15:40.513 --> 15:42.515
Baby abeds: Cool. Cool, cool, cool.

15:46.052 --> 15:47.387
Welcome.

15:47.453 --> 15:50.623
You are the first to make it
to the throne of hawkthorne.

15:50.690 --> 15:53.092
Let me take a look at you.

15:53.159 --> 15:55.228
According to your complexion,

15:55.295 --> 15:58.197
I think you might be Gilbert Lawson.

15:58.264 --> 16:00.233
Is this True?

16:00.300 --> 16:01.234
Just a moment.

16:01.301 --> 16:02.335
Hello, Gilbert.

16:02.402 --> 16:04.570
Due to the nature of our relationship,

16:04.637 --> 16:06.639
I'll need your electronic signature

16:06.706 --> 16:08.741
on this legally-Binding agreement.

16:09.809 --> 16:11.978
it dictates that you will never, ever

16:12.045 --> 16:13.413
besmirch the Hawthorne name

16:13.479 --> 16:15.348
with Any outlandish notions

16:15.415 --> 16:18.017
regarding you genealogical origins.

16:18.084 --> 16:19.552
You are the bastard offspring

16:19.619 --> 16:21.120
of a colored seductress

16:21.187 --> 16:23.589
and an unknown, weak-Willed miscegenist...

16:31.297 --> 16:34.434
it's a simple question, Gilbert.

16:34.500 --> 16:37.537
Do you agree?

16:38.972 --> 16:42.508
Thank you for being honest, Gilbert.

16:42.575 --> 16:44.744
No!

16:44.811 --> 16:47.280
I'm your son!

16:47.347 --> 16:48.581
I'm sorry, Gilbert.

16:48.648 --> 16:51.217
I always knew you'd disappoint me.

16:51.284 --> 16:52.752
Baby abeds: Cool cool cool! Cool Cool cool!

16:52.819 --> 16:53.820
Cool Cool cool!

16:53.886 --> 16:56.789
Ah, I see you've chosen teamwork.

16:56.856 --> 16:58.858
A coward's strategy.

16:58.925 --> 17:01.961
I will upgrade your challenge accordingly.

17:06.665 --> 17:07.867
?T× ?T×

17:07.934 --> 17:12.070
I bequeath my fortune to no inferiors.

17:12.137 --> 17:13.071
?T× ?T×

17:14.973 --> 17:16.643
- Yeah!
- Attack!

17:16.709 --> 17:18.911
What's this now?

17:18.978 --> 17:20.613
Whoo hoo hoo hoo! Here we go!

17:20.680 --> 17:23.415
Get him! Aim for the joints!

17:23.483 --> 17:24.416
Baby ABEDS: Cool cool cool! Cool Cool cool!

17:24.483 --> 17:25.585
- Take that!
- Get him!

17:25.652 --> 17:27.453
Die, racism!

17:30.223 --> 17:31.758
Troy and ABED: ?T× Troy
and abed shooting lava ?T×

17:31.824 --> 17:33.960
Yeah!

17:37.864 --> 17:39.299
Take that!

17:39.365 --> 17:42.335
- Aah!
- Aah! Oh, no! Aah!

17:43.937 --> 17:47.937
Hey! Look at me now, dad!

17:50.109 --> 17:52.078
Aah!

18:03.323 --> 18:06.225
I suppose you're wondering, player,

18:06.292 --> 18:10.292
why record myself breathing weird

18:10.964 --> 18:14.567
and letting you destroy me.

18:14.634 --> 18:18.938
Because I am a man of honor.

18:19.005 --> 18:23.005
So you've earned the
pleasure of my death.

18:23.643 --> 18:25.144
But I didn't.

18:25.211 --> 18:26.846
I'm not the one that beat you.

18:26.913 --> 18:29.248
Yes, you are.

18:29.315 --> 18:31.384
We're forfeiting.

18:31.451 --> 18:33.353
Stations one through seven abandoned.

18:33.419 --> 18:34.454
Players disqualified.

18:34.520 --> 18:35.555
Gilbert, you're right.

18:35.622 --> 18:37.156
You were more his son than me.

18:37.223 --> 18:38.825
You took all his crap

18:38.891 --> 18:40.526
and you didn't even
get to take his name.

18:40.593 --> 18:45.064
He once sat on me in church
just so he could see better.

18:45.131 --> 18:47.567
We've only been playing
this game a couple of hours.

18:47.634 --> 18:50.169
You've been playing
it your whole life,

18:50.236 --> 18:53.439
and now it's time for
your reward, brother.

18:53.506 --> 18:56.376
So get in there and kill our dad.

18:56.442 --> 18:59.879
Thank you, Pierce.

18:59.946 --> 19:02.148
Wait a second. Here, take this.

19:02.215 --> 19:03.149
- oh!
- Whoa!

19:03.216 --> 19:04.717
- You may need it.
- Oh, Pierce.

19:04.784 --> 19:07.186
You really don't know
how this works, do you?

19:07.253 --> 19:08.955
Are you always carrying that?

19:09.022 --> 19:10.256
Not in the shower.

19:21.968 --> 19:23.803
I'd like to thank
you again for today

19:23.870 --> 19:26.272
and offer my apologies for my conduct.

19:26.339 --> 19:27.707
I wasn't myself.

19:27.774 --> 19:30.777
Family can make a person
do a lot of crazy things.

19:30.843 --> 19:33.613
I understand. I have an
uncle who makes his own pizza.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.315
- don't worry about it.
- Yeah, totally.

19:35.381 --> 19:37.583
if it would make it up
to any of you in any way,

19:37.650 --> 19:39.118
there's a bar in
town called skeepers,

19:39.185 --> 19:40.887
and I hear they make a specialty drink--

19:40.954 --> 19:44.123
a Margarita, in fact,
and it's served in a glass

19:44.190 --> 19:46.259
an entire yard long.

19:46.326 --> 19:48.261
My treat. - Score.

19:48.328 --> 19:50.563
This is the greatest day of my life.

19:50.630 --> 19:52.732
I've always wanted
to have a brother.

19:52.799 --> 19:55.368
Hey, Hey, settle a bet.

19:55.435 --> 19:59.672
The word "Mulatto,
" is it okay or just borderline?

19:59.739 --> 20:02.709
- We apologize for him. - Oh,
that's okay. He's family.

20:13.319 --> 20:16.589
Hilda, my love,
I said I'd come back for you.

20:21.850 --> 20:22.884
I don't know.

20:22.951 --> 20:23.885
I just think that in a parallel universe,

20:23.952 --> 20:24.953
blorgons are-- - hold on.

20:25.019 --> 20:29.390
a baby. I wasn't expecting this.

20:29.457 --> 20:30.758
guess we'll have to support it.

20:30.825 --> 20:32.160
I guess I could get some kind of job,

20:32.227 --> 20:33.461
maybe at beans and more.

20:33.528 --> 20:34.629
I'll probably have to
work double shifts, but--

20:34.696 --> 20:36.464
Oh, I see.

20:36.531 --> 20:38.499
While you're off, climbing
the ladder at beans and more,

20:38.566 --> 20:39.868
I'll just stay home
and raise him alone.

20:39.934 --> 20:41.369
That's fine. I'll just give up on my dreams.

20:41.436 --> 20:42.871
- Here we go.
- What?

20:42.937 --> 20:45.840
He needs to learn a strong man can cry.

20:53.081 --> 20:54.749
So, what were you saying about blorgons?

20:56.618 --> 20:58.319
They're actually called glorbons.

20:59.305 --> 21:05.919
