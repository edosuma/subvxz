00:28.428 --> 00:30.830
Come on.

00:47.247 --> 00:49.214
Eric,
maybe i can do without it.

00:49.249 --> 00:52.052
Well,
you tried to stay off it
before, and you almost died.

00:52.087 --> 00:55.220
Yeah, but, see, i
heard about these people.

00:55.255 --> 00:57.657
Mutant x. They're supposed
to help people like me.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.261
I'm looking
after you now.

01:01.661 --> 01:05.665
I love you, ash,
and no one's going
to keep us apart.

01:28.488 --> 01:31.291
Now,
you stay back this time.

01:45.705 --> 01:49.274
Hold it right there, ashley.

01:49.309 --> 01:52.512
Time to stop running
and come on home.

02:01.721 --> 02:03.723
Hey!

02:42.162 --> 02:43.763
The power grid just died.

02:50.970 --> 02:53.773
The whole northwest
quadrant's blacked out.

02:56.976 --> 02:58.377
Oh, my god.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.497
You killed him.

03:00.532 --> 03:02.582
I didn't mean to.

03:08.988 --> 03:10.590
One twist
and he's history.

03:10.990 --> 03:13.758
Please,
just let him go.

03:13.793 --> 03:17.797
I knew he'd
be your soft spot.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.766
Go.

03:21.801 --> 03:24.604
Come on now, before you
need another feeding.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.175
Let's go.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.212
Listen to him, ashley.

03:32.247 --> 03:34.214
For me.

03:36.616 --> 03:38.218
Now!

03:45.825 --> 03:47.627
Ashley!

03:47.662 --> 03:49.429
Damn it!

03:49.829 --> 03:51.431
Come on, go!

03:51.466 --> 03:52.649
Go!

03:52.684 --> 03:53.833
Go on!

04:55.295 --> 04:56.461
Ufos?

04:56.496 --> 04:58.062
Black helicopters?

04:58.097 --> 04:59.664
Who knows? And who cares?

04:59.699 --> 05:02.467
Trust proxy blue to
have her own generator.

05:02.502 --> 05:04.904
Whatever it was, it ate
one of the city's power grids.

05:04.939 --> 05:07.272
So lock your doors
and bar your windows.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.510
I'm beginning to loathe that
computer-generated troublemaker.

05:10.545 --> 05:12.477
She's the only thing on-air.

05:12.512 --> 05:15.114
Come on, i ought
to hear something about
what's going on out there.

05:15.149 --> 05:17.717
Well, sometimes
nothing is better than
endless stream of paranoia.

05:17.752 --> 05:19.284
Shalimar?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.321
Yeah, we're still here, adam.

05:21.356 --> 05:22.487
Good.

05:22.522 --> 05:24.524
Hey, adam, figured out
what's caused the blackout yet?

05:24.559 --> 05:26.491
Well, trans-el hasn't
made any public statement yet,

05:26.526 --> 05:28.928
but i'm concerned
about rumours i've heard
from the underground -

05:28.963 --> 05:32.932
about new mutants with a
tremendous appetite for energy.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.735
I want you two back here.

05:40.139 --> 05:42.341
Emma's tapping into
trans-el's mainframe.

05:42.376 --> 05:44.544
And i think i might've
found something.

05:44.944 --> 05:47.747
Trans-el's
technical investigation
unit seems to think an

05:47.782 --> 05:50.550
outside source knocked out
the grid and drained the power.

05:50.585 --> 05:51.751
Hm.

05:52.151 --> 05:54.954
Well, a new mutant database
search should turn up any

05:55.355 --> 05:56.921
elementals who
could be suspects.

05:56.956 --> 05:58.958
But all the elementals i know
throw off energy like brennan.

05:58.993 --> 06:01.361
Yeah, but i've heard
about a couple energy absorbers

06:01.396 --> 06:02.527
in the underground.

06:02.562 --> 06:04.564
Yeah, and one of
them could be mutating.

06:05.765 --> 06:07.732
These three are the
most likely possibilities.

06:07.767 --> 06:12.572
Now, when one
of these energy-absorbing
elementals mutates,

06:12.607 --> 06:16.175
they seem to become ravenously
hungry for power and

06:16.210 --> 06:18.978
completely unable
to control that appetite.

06:30.189 --> 06:33.393
Put that out, mr. Cross.

06:33.428 --> 06:35.795
Now.

06:48.608 --> 06:50.174
Where's ashley elliott?

06:50.209 --> 06:52.211
I haven't got
her in custody - yet.

06:52.246 --> 06:53.778
Yes, i gather that.

06:53.813 --> 06:55.815
She managed to reach a
transformer before i got to her.

06:55.850 --> 06:57.782
I expected better
from you, mr. Cross.

06:57.817 --> 07:00.219
That's just because my track
record makes your gs agents

07:00.254 --> 07:02.587
look like losers.

07:02.622 --> 07:04.589
Well, i won't argue with that.

07:04.624 --> 07:07.427
You are the best bounty hunter
that i've ever worked with.

07:07.462 --> 07:10.194
That said, it is imperative
that you understand:

07:10.229 --> 07:13.232
Miss elliott is unlike any new
mutant you've tracked for me.

07:13.267 --> 07:16.235
We went over this when you
took out the contract for her.

07:16.636 --> 07:19.839
You want to use her as a weapon
to wipe out an enemy's power

07:20.239 --> 07:22.642
grid, blah, blah, blah.

07:23.042 --> 07:25.845
I suppose you can afford
to be so cavalier since we did

07:26.245 --> 07:28.212
agree to pay you
a million-dollar bounty.

07:28.247 --> 07:30.650
That's just because you realized
you had no other choice.

07:30.685 --> 07:33.670
Your people would've
never found her.

07:33.705 --> 07:36.621
I expect you to
execute our agreement.

07:36.656 --> 07:41.060
No more empty promises, no
more excuses, no more delays.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.463
No problem.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.676
Hello?

07:56.711 --> 07:57.877
Ashley.

07:58.277 --> 07:59.444
Oh, eric.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.080
Oh, god, i'm so sorry to
leave you in a lurch like that.

08:01.115 --> 08:02.682
I... i... i just didn't
know what else to do.

08:02.717 --> 08:05.102
No, no, baby,
it's all right, really.

08:05.137 --> 08:07.487
We both know you
did what you had to do.

08:07.522 --> 08:09.053
Where are you?

08:09.088 --> 08:12.692
Cross stuck me in a quonset hut
on an abandoned air force base.

08:12.727 --> 08:17.096
I think it's
somewhere near route 17.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.063
Are you all right?

08:19.098 --> 08:20.665
Yeah, he left me alone.

08:20.700 --> 08:23.903
He stuck me in some
kind of storage cage.

08:23.938 --> 08:25.905
Should i call the police?

08:25.940 --> 08:27.472
No, no, no.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.108
They'll ask too many questions.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.110
Then i'm coming to get you.

08:31.145 --> 08:32.712
Eric?

08:33.111 --> 08:35.114
Eric?

08:41.520 --> 08:43.322
Station twelve has a
four-hundred-megawatt capacitor.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.124
You're saying one of these
three elementals absorbed

08:45.159 --> 08:47.492
that much energy?

08:47.527 --> 08:50.329
He or she
is mutating which means
that the hunger is so

08:50.730 --> 08:53.132
intense that only
enormous quantities
of pure energy is

08:53.167 --> 08:55.535
going to satisfy
- and then not for long.

08:55.570 --> 08:57.902
You can stop
the mutation, though.

08:57.937 --> 08:59.904
Well, that depends on what
biological stage she's at.

08:59.939 --> 09:03.142
But brennan,
it doesn't mean that this
is going to happen to you.

09:03.177 --> 09:05.545
Genetically related,
though, right?

09:05.945 --> 09:07.947
Well, yeah, you're all
elementals but, you know,

09:07.982 --> 09:09.514
the similarity ends there.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.750
Besides, i'll
be monitoring you.

09:11.150 --> 09:13.152
Well,
jesse and i will go
check out the station.

09:13.187 --> 09:14.318
No, no, no.

09:14.353 --> 09:16.355
Shalimar and emma will do
that first thing in the morning.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.758
I want you and jesse
to work the data from here.

09:19.158 --> 09:20.359
What?

09:21.961 --> 09:24.764
Well, the problem
is that this new mutant
consumes energy, right?

09:24.799 --> 09:27.567
So, i mean, think of it
like this, that this rogue

09:27.602 --> 09:29.569
elemental's dc power.

09:29.969 --> 09:31.536
You're ac.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.573
So you two get together,
it could be explosive.

09:33.608 --> 09:37.577
Brennan, potentially lethal.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.212
Ashley!

10:15.615 --> 10:16.816
Eric.

10:20.019 --> 10:22.421
I shouldn't
have called you.

10:22.822 --> 10:24.388
Are you okay?

10:24.423 --> 10:26.025
I couldn't
leave you here.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.244
You don't
know this guy.

10:28.279 --> 10:30.429
He's... just a businessman.

10:34.834 --> 10:37.602
It's really nothing personal.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.639
But certain parties have
a strong interest in you

10:39.674 --> 10:42.842
and your unique abilities.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.811
Who?

10:46.846 --> 10:50.049
Why don't we let your
boyfriend explain that to you?

10:52.451 --> 10:53.653
What's he talking about?

10:54.053 --> 10:55.655
Just do
what he says, ash.

10:55.690 --> 10:56.856
See?

10:57.256 --> 10:58.858
It's that simple.

10:59.258 --> 11:02.461
When in doubt,
always best to cooperate.

11:10.870 --> 11:13.673
Unless you want things
to get even messier.

11:40.466 --> 11:42.068
Think i've got something.

11:42.103 --> 11:44.087
Yeah, me, too.

11:44.122 --> 11:46.072
You first.

11:46.472 --> 11:49.240
A woman's footprints
burned into the grass.

11:49.275 --> 11:52.078
I guess we're looking for
the female elemental then, huh?

11:52.113 --> 11:53.679
Yeah, ashley elliott.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.281
What have you got?

11:55.681 --> 11:57.283
Well, i'm thinking
she had company.

11:57.318 --> 11:58.849
Cigar butt.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.851
A cheroot, to be precise.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.888
And i'm having a hard
time believing she smokes these.

12:03.289 --> 12:04.490
Adam will
want to analyze that.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.092
I think so.

12:10.096 --> 12:10.896
Hey.

12:11.297 --> 12:14.465
"Leaves of grass"?

12:14.500 --> 12:16.502
Poetry happens
to help me relax and
whitman's a great poet.

12:16.537 --> 12:18.469
Aren't you
supposed to be working?

12:18.504 --> 12:21.707
No,
i'm waiting for adam's dna
report on that cigar butt.

12:21.742 --> 12:24.875
Thank you.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.512
Now, a good cheroot,
that's relaxing.

12:26.912 --> 12:28.914
Well, at least we
agree on something.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.916
Good poetry, good
cigar go hand in hand.

12:31.317 --> 12:32.118
Yeah.

12:32.518 --> 12:34.120
Well, we'd both rather
be out looking for her.

12:34.155 --> 12:35.686
Yeah, of course.

12:35.721 --> 12:37.923
Come on, who's more
qualified to find her than me?

12:37.958 --> 12:40.043
With my electrical charge,
i'm the best bait there is.

12:40.078 --> 12:42.093
Yeah, and of course
that's the only reason, right?

12:42.128 --> 12:44.930
I mean, the fact that she is
so hot she could make your eyes

12:44.965 --> 12:47.733
bleed has nothing
to do with it, right?

12:47.768 --> 12:50.753
She's just
your type, brennan.

12:50.788 --> 12:53.739
Beautiful,
vulnerable, dangerous.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.306
Hey, you two.

12:55.341 --> 12:58.144
You know, the both of you
make it sound like all

12:58.179 --> 12:59.745
i ever
think about is sex.

13:00.146 --> 13:01.747
Truth is i only think
about sex half the time.

13:02.148 --> 13:04.150
The other half of the time,
he's thinking about poetry.

13:04.185 --> 13:06.552
Which just makes
him think more about sex.

13:06.587 --> 13:08.954
But you're not
supposed to know that.

13:13.759 --> 13:15.761
You got all that
from a cigar butt?

13:15.796 --> 13:17.363
Well, it was well-chewed.

13:17.763 --> 13:20.966
Left plenty of
genetic residue behind.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.568
That's nice.

13:22.968 --> 13:26.972
We've got
a match: Neil cross.

13:27.373 --> 13:28.974
You know him?

13:29.009 --> 13:30.576
I know of him.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.578
Started as a repo man,
moved into skip tracing.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.180
Yeah,
tracking bail jumpers.

13:34.580 --> 13:35.746
Uh-huh.

13:35.781 --> 13:40.186
Convicted
second-degree murder, got early
release for good behaviour.

13:40.221 --> 13:42.188
Yeah, well, something tells
me there wasn't a whole lot

13:42.223 --> 13:43.789
of good behaviour involved.

13:45.391 --> 13:46.992
I heard rumours
that eckhart pulled some
strings to get him out.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.194
To work for the gsa.

13:48.229 --> 13:49.360
Uh huh.

13:49.395 --> 13:51.397
Freelance
as a bounty hunter.

13:51.432 --> 13:52.963
Oh, that's nice.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.565
Bringing in
new mutants for money.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.202
Well, i'll send all this
information over to jesse,

13:56.602 --> 13:59.004
all previous addresses,
because we find him,

13:59.039 --> 14:01.006
they find ashley elliott.

14:03.409 --> 14:05.411
Just so long as
i get a piece of him.

14:10.216 --> 14:11.782
Hey, we got lucky.

14:11.817 --> 14:13.419
Cross has been
on a spending spree.

14:13.454 --> 14:15.386
What do you mean?

14:15.421 --> 14:17.423
Well, he's got a half dozen
different aliases, but the

14:17.823 --> 14:19.825
electronic money trail all
leads back to the same account.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.792
What's he buying?

14:21.827 --> 14:23.794
Security equipment, electronics.

14:23.829 --> 14:26.232
Nothing really,
really out of the ordinary
for a bounty hunter.

14:26.632 --> 14:28.234
You got a shipping address?

14:28.634 --> 14:29.800
Not unless he's a pilot.

14:29.835 --> 14:31.437
He's been sending
stuff to a hangar

14:31.837 --> 14:33.439
over at nichols air force base.

14:33.474 --> 14:34.640
Maybe he is a pilot.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.642
Yeah, except nichols
has been out of commission

14:36.677 --> 14:38.244
for the last twenty years.

14:38.644 --> 14:40.246
Who wants to come
with me and check it out?

14:40.281 --> 14:41.847
Ooh, i'm right behind you.

14:45.050 --> 14:48.253
Deliver this
to mr. Cross and bring miss
elliott to me, mr. Henshaw.

14:48.288 --> 14:51.457
I'll need clearance
for a subdermal governor
implant device, sir.

14:51.492 --> 14:53.424
But she is not to
be damaged in any way.

14:53.459 --> 14:57.062
It is imperative that you
carry no electrical devices on

14:57.463 --> 14:59.430
your person when
you make the arrest.

14:59.465 --> 15:02.067
Make certain you are not within
a fifty-yard radius of any

15:02.102 --> 15:06.189
power lines, power stations,
transformers or any electrical

15:06.224 --> 15:10.276
unit emitting over five hundred
volts and you'll be fine.

15:10.311 --> 15:12.278
But once she has a
subdermal governor on her,

15:12.313 --> 15:13.479
she'll be neutralized.

15:13.879 --> 15:15.446
Miss elliott is
mutating, mr. Henshaw.

15:15.481 --> 15:18.284
It is impossible to say how
effective a governor will be.

15:57.523 --> 16:00.326
Always a pleasure
dealing with the gsa.

16:00.361 --> 16:06.732
You'll need
this to get her out.

16:06.767 --> 16:09.134
She's all yours.

16:13.539 --> 16:15.941
You're wearing
rubber soles, right?

16:40.766 --> 16:42.768
Oh my god.

16:45.571 --> 16:47.172
Get her out of there.

16:58.784 --> 17:00.185
No.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.587
Please.

17:01.987 --> 17:03.153
Relax, miss elliott.

17:03.188 --> 17:04.790
We're not going to hurt you.

17:06.392 --> 17:07.593
Let me go.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.595
Eric!

17:19.204 --> 17:21.607
Subdermal governor now!

17:26.412 --> 17:29.214
This is only half my money.

17:29.615 --> 17:31.582
I don't know
anything about that.

17:31.617 --> 17:34.019
Well, you tell eckhart
until i get the rest,

17:34.054 --> 17:36.422
the girl stays here.

17:41.226 --> 17:42.828
Get his gun and cover him.

17:42.863 --> 17:44.430
You're dead, all of you!

17:49.234 --> 17:51.637
You stay away from me.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.260
I'll take it from here.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.669
Should've listened to my friend
here when you had the chance.

18:26.872 --> 18:28.439
You're okay with us, ashley.

18:28.474 --> 18:30.476
But we've got
to get you to safety.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.967
Where am i?

18:57.002 --> 18:59.004
It's called sanctuary.

18:59.039 --> 19:01.023
My name's adam.

19:01.058 --> 19:02.973
So mutant x...

19:03.008 --> 19:04.610
i don't know what you
might have heard about us,

19:04.645 --> 19:06.229
but this part is true.

19:06.264 --> 19:08.039
Then you have to help me.

19:08.074 --> 19:09.815
Eric is in serious trouble.

19:09.850 --> 19:11.381
Who's eric?

19:11.416 --> 19:12.618
Eric, my fiance.

19:13.018 --> 19:14.619
Cross still has him.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.221
We're here to help.

19:20.626 --> 19:22.227
You shouldn't be in here.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.028
Why?

19:23.428 --> 19:24.629
She's got a
governor on, right?

19:24.664 --> 19:25.796
It should be perfectly safe.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.432
There's no need to
take unnecessary chances.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.434
Shalimar,
would you come in please?

19:29.835 --> 19:31.036
Listen,
i don't need your help.

19:31.071 --> 19:32.237
I just need eric.

19:32.638 --> 19:33.839
Ashley,
you should listen to adam.

19:33.874 --> 19:35.005
Right.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.607
I recommend
that you do the same.

19:36.642 --> 19:39.810
Now, ashley,
your abilities are mutating,

19:39.845 --> 19:43.013
which is where this appetite
for energy comes from.

19:43.048 --> 19:46.251
We'll do what we can to find
eric, but you need to stay here

19:46.286 --> 19:48.218
so i can compile
a genetic profile.

19:48.253 --> 19:51.456
Once i figure out the extent
of your mutation i...

20:05.470 --> 20:08.273
adam,
maybe i should go get eric.

20:12.678 --> 20:13.478
Right.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.080
Shalimar's going
to keep you company here,

20:15.480 --> 20:16.682
make sure that
you're comfortable.

20:17.082 --> 20:18.684
Let's you and
i go have a little talk.

20:20.686 --> 20:22.287
Brennan.

20:23.488 --> 20:25.090
Brennan.

20:36.301 --> 20:37.467
You okay?

20:37.502 --> 20:39.104
Yeah. Yeah, i'm fine.

20:39.504 --> 20:40.671
Yeah? Maybe, maybe not.

20:40.706 --> 20:43.108
What she's feeling for
you is pure electromagnetism.

20:43.143 --> 20:45.510
And what are you feeling?

20:45.545 --> 20:47.878
I don't know.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.714
I just really
want to help her.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.481
Well, we're all
going to do that.

20:51.516 --> 20:52.718
Okay, well, then i don't
see what the problem is.

20:53.118 --> 20:54.319
I can still, you know...

20:54.354 --> 20:55.485
yeah, okay, yeah.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.722
Maybe you can
handle the magnetism.

20:56.757 --> 20:58.288
Maybe she can't.

20:58.323 --> 20:59.925
Look, adam,
it's not magnetism.

21:00.325 --> 21:01.126
We're both elementals.

21:01.526 --> 21:02.728
We just have a connection.

21:02.763 --> 21:03.894
You okay?

21:03.929 --> 21:05.330
I shouldn't
even be here.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.697
I should
be with eric.

21:06.732 --> 21:09.499
Well, i think
i know how you feel.

21:09.534 --> 21:12.937
No, you haven't the
faintest idea how i feel.

21:12.972 --> 21:15.858
Being pulled in two
different directions.

21:15.893 --> 21:18.744
I mean, you want
to help your boyfriend,

21:19.144 --> 21:21.111
but there's brennan
right in front of you.

21:21.146 --> 21:23.548
All right, but you're
not hearing what i'm saying.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.150
No, i am hearing
what you're saying.

21:25.185 --> 21:26.351
I'm just asking.

21:26.752 --> 21:29.154
I mean,
why can't i go in and have
a conversation with her?

21:29.189 --> 21:31.556
Brennan,
i don't want you to think
that this is something

21:31.591 --> 21:33.375
other than what it is.

21:33.410 --> 21:35.486
She's dangerous for you.

21:35.521 --> 21:37.562
You stay away from her.

21:46.772 --> 21:48.373
Is he your boyfriend?

21:48.408 --> 21:50.741
No.

21:50.776 --> 21:55.545
He's more like a brother.

21:55.580 --> 21:59.184
So this isn't about you
protecting your turf.

21:59.219 --> 22:01.186
No, it's not.

22:01.586 --> 22:04.389
I'm trying to tell you that
what you're feeling about

22:04.790 --> 22:06.792
brennan has absolutely
nothing to do with eric.

22:06.827 --> 22:09.159
It's pure
electromagnetic attraction.

22:09.194 --> 22:11.196
I just need to talk to
him, just for a minute.

22:11.231 --> 22:13.598
Can't let you do it.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.401
But he wants to help me.

22:16.802 --> 22:18.804
We all want to help you.

22:19.204 --> 22:21.606
But for everyone's
sake, including yours,

22:22.007 --> 22:24.810
you've got to
stay away from him.

22:30.015 --> 22:33.218
Ashley, i don't know
how to find you so i'm...

22:33.253 --> 22:35.986
i'm calling our voice mail.

22:36.021 --> 22:42.427
Cross said he's going to kill
me unless you come back here.

22:42.462 --> 22:49.234
I don't want to
tell you to do that.

22:49.634 --> 22:53.638
I just don't see any other way.

22:53.673 --> 22:57.642
I love you, ash, i really do.

23:03.248 --> 23:05.615
How was that?

23:05.650 --> 23:09.254
If you ask me, you laid
it on a little thick.

23:09.289 --> 23:12.057
Come on, she
loves that stuff.

23:12.092 --> 23:13.623
Trust me.

23:13.658 --> 23:17.262
Ashley thinks
that i am the best thing
that ever happened to her.

23:17.297 --> 23:21.266
Speaking of
the best thing, we need
to talk about my cut.

23:21.301 --> 23:23.233
What about it?

23:23.268 --> 23:24.870
Come on, fifty grand?

23:25.270 --> 23:27.272
I heard you arguing
with those guys about

23:27.307 --> 23:29.291
the half
mil' they owe you.

23:29.326 --> 23:31.241
You and me,
we had our deal.

23:31.276 --> 23:34.079
Well, that was before
i knew how much you were

23:34.114 --> 23:36.081
making off
my hard labour.

23:36.116 --> 23:37.682
That's my business.

23:38.083 --> 23:42.487
Ashley wouldn't come
running if not for me.

23:46.491 --> 23:50.896
True, and don't
think i don't appreciate
you making that call.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.521
Well, i finally
got tired of waiting.

24:16.922 --> 24:18.088
Hey.

24:18.123 --> 24:21.326
How come you
didn't come back?

24:21.361 --> 24:23.328
Well,
i wanted to, but...

24:23.363 --> 24:26.096
wait a minute.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.732
Adam said you're not
supposed to leave the lab.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.734
I know, but i had
to come and find you.

24:29.769 --> 24:33.303
You know what?

24:33.338 --> 24:35.340
Adam also said that
we're not supposed
to get too close.

24:35.375 --> 24:36.959
Yeah, he told me
that, too, but i...

24:36.994 --> 24:38.508
i thought this
thing made it okay.

24:38.543 --> 24:40.946
Well,
apparently, the governor
doesn't work so well when

24:41.346 --> 24:43.313
you're mutating.

24:43.348 --> 24:46.151
Well, at least i don't feel
like i'm going to pass out if

24:46.186 --> 24:48.153
i don't get my energy feed.

24:48.188 --> 24:50.120
That's a good thing.

24:50.155 --> 24:54.559
So do you ever worry
that something like this

24:54.594 --> 24:56.526
is going to happen to you?

24:56.561 --> 24:58.929
No, it won't, at
least not in the same way.

24:58.964 --> 25:04.569
But you're feeling something
right now, too, aren't you?

25:04.604 --> 25:09.339
I mean, it's...

25:09.374 --> 25:11.376
it's not just me, is it?

25:17.382 --> 25:20.150
No, it's not just you.

25:20.185 --> 25:25.190
Adam said there's some
kind of electromagnetic pull

25:25.225 --> 25:30.195
happening between us that's
got nothing to do with...

25:30.595 --> 25:34.599
well, with what
i want to do right now.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.802
Yeah, he made
that pretty clear.

25:37.837 --> 25:41.023
I'm really confused.

25:41.058 --> 25:44.174
I mean, i love eric.

25:44.209 --> 25:47.412
I'm worried sick about him.

25:47.447 --> 25:50.615
But i look at you and...

26:00.625 --> 26:02.592
i'm sorry.

26:02.627 --> 26:06.631
I... i... i just had
to find out how that felt.

26:06.666 --> 26:07.832
Ashley, wait. Wait.

26:07.867 --> 26:08.999
Please...

26:09.034 --> 26:10.635
don't tell eric.

26:21.546 --> 26:24.349
Cross said he's going to kill
me unless you come back here.

26:24.384 --> 26:26.751
I don't want
to tell you to do that.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.353
I just don't see any other way.

26:28.388 --> 26:29.772
I love you, ash.

26:29.807 --> 26:31.156
I really do.

26:31.556 --> 26:34.359
Then if you guys aren't going
to help, i'm going back there.

26:34.394 --> 26:37.162
Ashley,
i have to ask you something,
something very important.

26:37.197 --> 26:40.382
How well do you know eric?

26:40.417 --> 26:43.533
What's that
supposed to mean?

26:43.568 --> 26:47.572
I'm closer to him
than anybody in the world.

26:47.607 --> 26:49.139
Why?

26:49.174 --> 26:51.141
This is
a voice stress analyzer.

26:51.176 --> 26:53.178
Yeah, well, i guess
he's under a lot of stress.

26:53.213 --> 26:55.981
It's also a pretty
accurate lie detector.

26:56.016 --> 26:57.582
What?

26:57.983 --> 26:59.549
He's not lying.

26:59.584 --> 27:01.586
Adam incorporated this
technology into the systems...

27:01.621 --> 27:02.787
you know what?

27:03.188 --> 27:04.789
Eric's call came
in over an hour ago.

27:04.824 --> 27:05.991
We're wasting our time.

27:06.391 --> 27:08.758
What's going on?

27:08.793 --> 27:11.596
I analyzed eric's call
to ashley's voice mail.

27:11.631 --> 27:13.198
There's the results.

27:16.001 --> 27:17.167
He's lying.

27:17.202 --> 27:19.604
You're wrong,
both of you.

27:24.409 --> 27:26.011
Cross nabbed her
the last time he called.

27:26.411 --> 27:27.612
He's setting her up.

27:28.013 --> 27:32.017
And she is convinced
that she needs to save him.

27:32.052 --> 27:34.819
Why don't you and
shalimar head over there?

27:34.854 --> 27:37.622
And jesse,
keep your eye on cross.

27:37.657 --> 27:39.224
Yeah.

27:47.232 --> 27:48.233
Please, brennan.

27:48.268 --> 27:49.234
Woah, hey...

27:49.634 --> 27:50.435
you have to help me.

27:50.470 --> 27:51.636
Are you okay?

27:52.037 --> 27:52.837
What's wrong?

27:53.238 --> 27:54.404
Nobody is
listening to me.

27:54.439 --> 27:56.041
Everybody's
saying eric's lying.

27:56.441 --> 27:58.043
Cross is going
to kill him unless
we do something.

27:58.443 --> 28:00.010
Okay.

28:00.045 --> 28:02.047
Okay, let's talk.

28:02.082 --> 28:03.648
Come on, go.

28:07.252 --> 28:09.254
Eric needs me and no
one's letting me go to him.

28:09.654 --> 28:10.855
That's all i want to do.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.057
Ashley,
you can't leave.

28:12.457 --> 28:13.658
What am i supposed
to do, brennan?

28:13.693 --> 28:14.824
Let him die?

28:14.859 --> 28:16.026
No, i am
not saying that.

28:16.061 --> 28:17.662
But i don't think cross
is interested in eric,

28:18.063 --> 28:19.264
except as bait to
get you to come running.

28:19.664 --> 28:21.266
Yeah, but i'm scared of what
he's going to do if i don't.

28:21.301 --> 28:24.869
Ashley, you are in no
condition to go anywhere

28:24.904 --> 28:26.471
or help
anyone right now.

28:26.506 --> 28:28.473
How about you?

28:28.873 --> 28:32.077
I can't do anything.

28:32.477 --> 28:35.280
Is that what
you guys stand for?

28:35.315 --> 28:38.083
Ashley, it's more
complex than that.

28:38.118 --> 28:39.649
Explain it to me then.

28:39.684 --> 28:41.286
Just because eric
isn't a new mutant,

28:41.321 --> 28:42.487
it's okay to let him die?

28:42.887 --> 28:43.653
No.

28:43.688 --> 28:45.290
You are our priority
right now, ashley.

28:45.325 --> 28:46.491
You don't understand.

28:46.891 --> 28:48.093
None of you...

28:56.901 --> 28:58.903
ashley, wait.

28:59.304 --> 29:01.671
Ashley,
your governor blew up.

29:01.706 --> 29:04.909
Okay, you need to
listen to me right now.

29:04.944 --> 29:08.730
Ashley, don't do it.

29:08.765 --> 29:12.517
Ashley, don't do it.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.519
Don't.

29:53.758 --> 29:55.360
Ashley, you seen brennan?

29:55.395 --> 29:57.362
He's around.

29:57.762 --> 30:00.565
Hey, you're supposed
to stay in the lab.

30:00.965 --> 30:03.333
Well, jesse, i'm...

30:03.368 --> 30:08.573
i'm just going
to take your plane
out for a little spin.

30:28.193 --> 30:30.395
Can't you make
any adjustments to her
to slow the mutation?

30:30.430 --> 30:32.597
Well, yeah,
i can slow it but at this
point, i can't stop it

30:32.997 --> 30:34.999
and until i
get the exact adjustment,
the best thing we can

30:35.400 --> 30:36.966
do is help her ride it out.

30:37.001 --> 30:39.003
Ashley is so
scared and confused.

30:39.404 --> 30:40.205
Well,
believe me, i know...

30:40.240 --> 30:41.371
adam!

30:41.406 --> 30:44.174
What happened?

30:44.209 --> 30:46.176
He tried to stop ashley.

30:46.211 --> 30:47.812
She hit me with
an electric charge,

30:48.213 --> 30:49.414
then took off
in the double helix.

30:49.814 --> 30:50.980
Blasted you?

30:51.015 --> 30:52.582
She doesn't throw
energy, she absorbs it.

30:52.617 --> 30:54.219
And how did she know
how to operate the helix?

30:54.619 --> 30:56.621
Where's brennan?

30:56.656 --> 31:00.590
Ashley.

31:00.625 --> 31:03.428
Ashley, can you hear me?

31:03.463 --> 31:05.395
I hear you.

31:05.430 --> 31:07.432
I need you to come back in.

31:07.467 --> 31:10.052
Forget about it.

31:10.087 --> 31:12.602
Is brennan with you?

31:12.637 --> 31:16.241
He's closer than
you'd ever imagine.

31:16.276 --> 31:18.208
What's that
supposed to mean?

31:18.243 --> 31:20.645
Ashley, i'm going
to talk you back in.

31:20.680 --> 31:22.647
It's too late for that.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.249
See if you can do an override.

31:24.284 --> 31:25.450
Okay.

31:36.261 --> 31:39.864
<screams>

31:40.665 --> 31:43.468
ashley's got brennan
trapped somewhere.

31:43.503 --> 31:45.435
Ashley.

31:45.470 --> 31:49.474
Ashley, did you somehow manage
to absorb brennan, his energy?

31:49.509 --> 31:51.441
You we're right, adam.

31:51.476 --> 31:54.279
He really should've
kept his distance.

31:54.679 --> 31:56.281
Okay, ashley,
you've got to listen to me.

31:56.316 --> 31:58.300
I'm finished listening.

31:58.335 --> 31:59.910
I've got to save eric.

31:59.945 --> 32:01.486
Eric sold you out.

32:01.886 --> 32:03.087
He's working
for cross now.

32:03.488 --> 32:04.689
Eric would
never do that.

32:04.724 --> 32:07.091
He loves me.

32:07.126 --> 32:09.459
Ashley?

32:09.494 --> 32:13.097
She turned off the com link.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.718
Nice to see you again, ashley.

32:33.753 --> 32:36.321
You made the right decision.

32:44.329 --> 32:47.897
Let eric go and i'll
do whatever you want.

32:47.932 --> 32:51.936
Ashley, ashley, ashley, you've
got to learn how to trust or

32:51.971 --> 32:54.339
you're never going to
find a place in this world.

32:54.374 --> 32:56.341
Who are you
selling me to?

32:56.376 --> 32:57.907
Now, that's not fair.

32:57.942 --> 33:03.548
After all we've been through,
you make me sound so unfeeling.

33:03.583 --> 33:05.114
Okay.

33:05.149 --> 33:06.751
If you're not going
to answer my question,

33:06.786 --> 33:08.718
then tell
me where eric is.

33:08.753 --> 33:13.558
It was eric
who offered to bring you
to me in the first place.

33:13.593 --> 33:16.761
I don't believe you.

33:17.161 --> 33:21.566
Believe what
you want, honey.

33:21.601 --> 33:26.771
She wants you back, eric.

33:26.806 --> 33:29.539
Eric?

33:29.574 --> 33:32.777
What have
you done to him?

33:32.812 --> 33:36.381
Where is he?

33:36.781 --> 33:40.785
He's behind the trailer.

33:54.399 --> 33:55.965
Any luck?

33:56.000 --> 33:58.002
Well, i think i've got
cross' cell phone number.

33:58.403 --> 34:00.004
He's had a lot of aliases,
lots of phone numbers.

34:00.039 --> 34:02.407
I'm accessing
the frequency now.

34:05.209 --> 34:06.811
I've got the girl.

34:06.846 --> 34:08.413
You still want her?

34:08.447 --> 34:09.614
Got him.

34:10.014 --> 34:11.581
I appreciate
your persistence.

34:11.616 --> 34:14.018
And i appreciate
your deep pockets.

34:14.053 --> 34:16.786
Two million or no elemental.

34:16.821 --> 34:19.223
No new mutant
is worth that much.

34:19.257 --> 34:21.626
Then the deal is off.

34:25.630 --> 34:28.032
How's the girl?

34:28.433 --> 34:29.599
She's hungry.

34:29.634 --> 34:32.036
But i'm going to wait until
the deal's made before i fill

34:32.071 --> 34:34.255
her up with her daily volts.

34:34.291 --> 34:36.406
She'll die if you wait too long.

34:36.440 --> 34:40.043
Then that would just
be awful, now wouldn't it?

34:40.079 --> 34:42.847
Considering how
much you want to meet her.

34:43.246 --> 34:46.851
Tell me where to send my men.

34:46.886 --> 34:50.420
We got the double helix back?

34:50.455 --> 34:52.456
We overrode and brought it back
as soon as she was out of there.

34:52.857 --> 34:54.458
Eckhart said ashley will
die if she doesn't feed soon.

34:54.494 --> 34:56.025
And if ashley dies?

34:56.060 --> 34:57.662
Then brennan dies with her.

34:59.664 --> 35:01.265
What happens
when she draws power?

35:01.300 --> 35:02.832
Well, with
brennan inside her,

35:02.867 --> 35:04.869
drawing power
would be devastating.

35:05.269 --> 35:07.271
When she absorbed him both
their systems started creating

35:07.306 --> 35:09.674
antigens, and that
reaction's building toward

35:10.074 --> 35:13.242
a catastrophic release.

35:13.277 --> 35:14.444
So the more
energy she absorbs,

35:14.479 --> 35:16.080
the greater the
electrochemical reaction.

35:16.481 --> 35:17.647
Exactly.

35:17.682 --> 35:18.848
How big are
we talking about?

35:18.883 --> 35:20.850
An explosion big
enough to level a city.

35:20.885 --> 35:23.287
Now you two get over
to station twelve, all right?

35:23.322 --> 35:25.690
The moment she starts
drawing power, i need to know.

35:29.293 --> 35:30.895
Mr. Cross has
become a liability.

35:31.295 --> 35:32.862
I couldn't agree more, sir.

35:32.897 --> 35:36.466
How delightful
to have your support.

35:36.501 --> 35:39.303
I would like you to
go out to station twelve.

35:39.338 --> 35:42.071
One problem
with that, sir.

35:42.106 --> 35:43.708
Cross blames
me personally for
the previous incident

35:44.108 --> 35:45.274
and i feel that...

35:45.309 --> 35:46.911
i have no interest
whatsoever in how you feel.

35:47.311 --> 35:49.714
Shoot mr. Cross and
this time, for god's sake,

35:49.749 --> 35:51.315
make sure he's dead.

36:04.262 --> 36:05.428
Jesse?

36:05.463 --> 36:06.864
I'm here, adam.

36:06.899 --> 36:08.266
Any sign of ashley?

36:08.301 --> 36:09.066
Not yet.

36:09.467 --> 36:10.668
Emma, how much
time do we have?

36:10.703 --> 36:12.235
I'm working on it.

36:12.270 --> 36:15.072
Alright, emma, i've rerouted
the ionizing filter to you.

36:15.107 --> 36:17.475
Now, as soon as you're online...

36:17.510 --> 36:19.076
i'll be ready here.

36:19.111 --> 36:20.243
Good.

36:20.278 --> 36:22.280
Now, once ashley starts
drawing energy from the power

36:22.680 --> 36:24.682
station, we have a brief window
to break down the spark gap

36:25.082 --> 36:26.649
which i'll do from here.

36:26.684 --> 36:29.487
The spark will ionize the air,
magnetizing the double helix,

36:29.522 --> 36:31.854
creating a lightning rod.

36:31.889 --> 36:33.491
And that'll pull
brennan from ashley?

36:33.526 --> 36:34.657
That's the idea.

36:34.692 --> 36:36.659
Remind me, never
date an elemental.

36:36.694 --> 36:38.296
I don't think brennan's
going to need any reminding.

36:38.331 --> 36:40.298
Yeah, well, i'm going
to remind him anyway.

36:44.702 --> 36:45.903
There's ashley.

36:46.304 --> 36:47.505
She's here.

36:49.106 --> 36:50.708
Come on, feeding time.

36:50.743 --> 36:51.909
Wake up.

37:34.352 --> 37:37.154
Emma, it's time to drop stealth
shields and open all channels.

37:37.189 --> 37:39.557
Trust me, adam,
you don't have to ask me twice.

37:46.364 --> 37:48.366
Now.

38:12.390 --> 38:13.991
Hold on, emma.

38:17.194 --> 38:18.396
She's way too close.

38:18.431 --> 38:19.997
Pull up, adam.

38:20.032 --> 38:21.163
Come on.

38:21.198 --> 38:23.200
Emma, reverse the polarity now.

38:29.206 --> 38:35.613
<screams>

39:06.444 --> 39:08.446
come on, brennan.

39:08.481 --> 39:11.248
Come on.

39:19.256 --> 39:22.059
You sure took your sweet time.

39:22.094 --> 39:24.462
We got him.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.683
How'm i doing?

39:46.083 --> 39:49.251
I think you're
going to be all right.

39:49.286 --> 39:53.690
I can't explain how exactly,
but i feel different.

39:53.725 --> 39:58.095
Well, i readjusted your
electrochemical balance.

39:58.496 --> 40:00.898
You'll never have the need to
feed on energy like that again.

40:01.298 --> 40:02.900
I hope not.

40:03.300 --> 40:05.703
I just wish...

40:09.306 --> 40:10.508
how do you feel?

40:10.543 --> 40:11.726
Good.

40:11.761 --> 40:12.910
Good.

40:13.310 --> 40:14.912
So you two probably
have things to talk about.

40:14.947 --> 40:16.514
I'll see you outside.

40:16.914 --> 40:18.916
We've got five minutes,
then we'll take her to the

40:18.951 --> 40:20.518
safehouse, pass
her off to her escort.

40:26.924 --> 40:30.528
I... i haven't had
a chance to apologize.

40:30.563 --> 40:32.129
Don't worry about it.

40:32.164 --> 40:33.696
Adam was right.

40:33.731 --> 40:35.733
We were both
just caught up in something
we couldn't control.

40:35.768 --> 40:37.752
Well, i appreciate
that, brennan.

40:37.787 --> 40:39.737
Ashley, trust me,
you and i are okay.

40:39.772 --> 40:42.540
Here, for you.

40:42.940 --> 40:44.507
It's okay.

40:44.542 --> 40:48.145
Adam says it's
safe for us to touch now.

40:48.546 --> 40:51.313
"Leaves of grass. "

40:51.348 --> 40:54.917
How did you know i
fell in love with this?

40:54.952 --> 40:59.356
Well,
let's just say i got a chance
to get to know you a little.

40:59.757 --> 41:03.360
Maybe a little too well.

41:03.395 --> 41:06.981
But i'll never tell.

41:07.016 --> 41:10.568
Neither will i. Come on.

41:25.382 --> 41:26.584
Anybody home?

41:36.193 --> 41:37.760
Okay.

41:37.795 --> 41:39.797
You guys mind telling me
what the hell is going on here?

41:39.832 --> 41:42.600
We just wanted to
make sure your reflexes

41:42.635 --> 41:43.801
didn't get all screwed up.

41:44.201 --> 41:45.002
And it
looks like they did.

41:45.402 --> 41:46.604
Hey, i thought
he did pretty good.

41:47.805 --> 41:50.007
I never should
have been able to
get through like that.

41:50.042 --> 41:53.528
So you're
going to need extensive
retraining and you're

41:53.563 --> 41:57.014
going to need
walt whitman to help
you get through it.

41:57.049 --> 41:59.416
Welcome back.

41:59.817 --> 42:01.784
It's good to be back.

42:01.819 --> 42:03.821
I thought you didn't
want to come back.
