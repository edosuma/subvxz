30:43.800 --> 30:45.218
It's a pleasure, Mr. President.

31:08.700 --> 31:13.705
Here is a club pass for Real Madrid.

31:40.357 --> 31:44.027
FLORENTINO PÉREZ
PRESIDENT OF REAL MADRID

33:34.262 --> 33:36.932
I know exactly what my fans want,

33:36.932 --> 33:39.976
and I knew Beckham
was one of those players

33:39.976 --> 33:42.938
who were born to play at Real Madrid.

33:42.938 --> 33:46.024
So I did everything I could

33:46.024 --> 33:47.651
to get him.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.216
I am pleased to announce

36:17.175 --> 36:20.095
that Manchester United have agreed

36:21.304 --> 36:23.765
to a deal

36:23.765 --> 36:26.768
that will make David Beckham a player

36:26.768 --> 36:28.561
for Barcelona FC.

DAVID GARDNER

40:30.511 --> 40:35.308
It may sound bad if I say it,
but with all respect to Manchester United,

40:35.308 --> 40:39.729
like I said before,
he was simply born to play at Real Madrid.

41:06.839 --> 41:11.302

41:16.432 --> 41:20.687
<i>taking his final step
to becoming a Real Madrid player.</i>

41:21.896 --> 41:26.234
In our opinion, he's in perfect condition.

41:28.486 --> 41:32.073
He also seems like
he's got his feet on the ground.

BIENVENIDO MR. BECKHAM

BECKHAM
REAL MADRID

43:56.717 --> 43:58.219
Good morning.

43:58.928 --> 44:02.598
David Beckham is here
because we believe in him as a footballer.

44:02.598 --> 44:05.476
He is a man who is a symbol of our era,

44:05.476 --> 44:08.145
a symbol of post-modernity.

44:09.063 --> 44:13.568
David, welcome to the league of dreams.

47:07.992 --> 47:10.703
We see this gorgeous guy.

47:10.703 --> 47:13.080
A blond guy who is joining our team.

ROBERTO CARLOS

RONALDO NÁZARIO

REAL MADRID 2000-2005

49:25.105 --> 49:29.633
We were able to triple our revenue.

50:29.485 --> 50:33.906
It was more like a rock band
than a football team.

50:40.079 --> 50:41.539
This transcended football.

50:45.751 --> 50:48.712
We were no longer talking
only about football lovers.

50:49.630 --> 50:51.882
Women supporters.

50:54.635 --> 51:00.015
On the advertising billboards,
there were 40 Beckham adverts

51:00.015 --> 51:01.016
and only one of me.

51:08.148 --> 51:09.775

51:52.401 --> 51:55.279
<i>Now Real Madrid are in possession
of this publicity machine.</i>

51:55.279 --> 51:59.742
<i>Now Beckham is seen as
a figure of worship in Asia.</i>

52:36.362 --> 52:39.448
WE FIND THE ONLY MAN ON THE PLANET
WHO HASN'T HEARD OF BECKS

53:04.640 --> 53:07.476
<i>Well, she says Spain smells like garlic.</i>

53:19.655 --> 53:22.866
<i>Victoria Beckham sent shock waves
through Madrid last night</i>

53:22.866 --> 53:24.910
<i>on her first social appearance in Spain.</i>

53:25.494 --> 53:26.954
<i>She ordered vegetables and fish,</i>

53:26.954 --> 53:29.998
<i>but she only ate three almonds
and drank some water.</i>

53:29.998 --> 53:33.377
HOW POUTING POSH BECAME A PAIN IN SPAIN

53:34.169 --> 53:35.462
PAE-HELL-A

53:37.506 --> 53:40.467
<i>She forced a smile
and didn't speak to the press.</i>

54:12.082 --> 54:16.670
<i>And on top of that, we find her
in line at a hamburger restaurant.</i>

54:24.094 --> 54:25.596
<i>They say she longs for London,</i>

54:25.596 --> 54:28.515
<i>that here in Madrid she doesn't find
the glamour she's used to.</i>

54:38.776 --> 54:43.238
<i>A new Real Madrid manager was
unveiled today at the Bernabéu Stadium.</i>

54:43.238 --> 54:46.575
I'd like to express my gratitude

54:48.285 --> 54:53.457
for this opportunity to manage and coach

54:53.457 --> 54:54.666
Real Madrid.

54:57.878 --> 55:01.632
CARLOS QUEIROZ
REAL MADRID MANAGER 2003/04

55:06.428 --> 55:12.267
It's one of the best clubs in the world.

55:42.923 --> 55:44.675
<i>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

55:44.675 --> 55:46.718
<i>It's a special day for David Beckham.</i>

55:46.718 --> 55:50.556
<i>David Beckham makes his debut</i>

55:50.556 --> 55:52.391
<i>in a Real Madrid shirt.</i>

56:35.309 --> 56:37.352
Real Madrid are obliged to win.

56:38.353 --> 56:42.608
There's a pressure to win which is crazy.

56:45.819 --> 56:49.364
In the moments leading up to the match,

56:51.158 --> 56:53.452
you try not to get nervous...

56:56.246 --> 56:59.166
or unsure of yourself.

57:17.392 --> 57:19.811
RCD MALLORCA V REAL MADRID
FIRST AWAY GAME 2003/04 SEASON

01:01:02.617 --> 01:01:06.162
What about the rumors
that you're not settled?

01:01:23.471 --> 01:01:26.683
We let him know that we were there

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:29.060
for whatever he needed.

01:01:49.664 --> 01:01:52.000
It was about gestures.

01:01:52.584 --> 01:01:57.255
He knew exactly what I was saying to him
and vice versa.

01:02:29.287 --> 01:02:34.417
<i>It's David Beckham's first game
at the Bernabéu before his fans.</i>

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:38.380
REAL MADRID V RCD MALLORCA
FIRST HOME GAME 2003/04 SEASON

01:02:53.311 --> 01:02:56.231
<i>It's a complete sellout here today.</i>

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:16.418
He's nervous.

01:03:32.434 --> 01:03:36.521
<i>He's been asked to play
more defensive again.</i>

01:03:37.022 --> 01:03:39.399
He's played 14 years on the right.

01:03:40.942 --> 01:03:45.321
But great players
all have moments in their life

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:48.825
when they find a new dimension.

01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:59.836
He just needed to relax because
the buck didn't stop with him.

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:01.588
If we win, we win as one.

01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:04.924
If we lose, we lose as one.

01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:44.375
It was great.

01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:05.772
