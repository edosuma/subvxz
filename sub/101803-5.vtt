00:10.575 --> 00:11.576

yours, Ray, you are

00:11.620 --> 00:12.882
one selfish little...Hey, hey!

00:12.925 --> 00:14.927
Change and operators
aren't always a good mix.

00:17.843 --> 00:19.802
DAVIS: Video just came in.LINDELL: That's Perry.

00:19.845 --> 00:22.283
A SEAL has never been
in enemy captivity before.

00:22.326 --> 00:23.284
I want my team back.

00:23.327 --> 00:24.807
Bravo is not deployable.

00:24.850 --> 00:25.808
They are with me.

00:25.851 --> 00:27.070
Good to have our QB back.

00:27.114 --> 00:28.680
I'm not back, Sonny,
I'm just here for Ray.

00:28.724 --> 00:30.595
You'll be without overwatch
or a close QRF.

00:30.639 --> 00:31.814
JASON: <i>
Eh, we'll take that deal.</i>

00:31.857 --> 00:33.120
SONNY:
They must got something

00:33.163 --> 00:34.338
really big in there
with all this firepower!

00:34.382 --> 00:36.079
Or someone!

00:36.123 --> 00:37.428
JASON: <i>
Not waiting on the cavalry.</i>

00:37.472 --> 00:38.821
We got to see what's inside.

00:40.344 --> 00:42.651
[grunting]

00:42.694 --> 00:43.913
Clear. I got nothing.

00:43.956 --> 00:45.088
This ain't the place, boys.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.959
Video file from a phone
Bravo pulled.

00:47.003 --> 00:48.309
JASON:
The picture on the wall.
We were in that room.

00:48.352 --> 00:49.484
20 minutes late.

00:49.527 --> 00:51.312
DAVIS: <i>
There was something else</i>

00:51.355 --> 00:52.487
<i>on the phone.
Messages offering Ray up.</i>

00:52.530 --> 00:54.054
I let him slip away.

01:03.933 --> 01:05.891
Sonny, pass me that extra mag,
will you?

01:07.241 --> 01:08.459
[clattering]

01:09.547 --> 01:10.635
Will you guys knock it off?

01:11.723 --> 01:12.855
SONNY:
You do you, Thirty.

01:12.898 --> 01:14.726
The rest of us
are gonna stay ready

01:14.770 --> 01:16.728
for the next time
we roll out to get Ray.

01:16.772 --> 01:18.252
Four hits since we missed him
three days ago.

01:18.295 --> 01:20.167
That ain't enough
to keep you primed?

01:20.210 --> 01:23.518
So many dry holes,
they got me chafing.

01:23.561 --> 01:26.477
The longer it takes to find him,
the worse his chances get.

01:26.521 --> 01:29.872
Whole task force has torn
Tunisia apart, so...

01:29.915 --> 01:31.656
could be he's been
moved out of country.

01:31.700 --> 01:34.181
Davis wasn't sure who Ansar
was brokering him to.

01:34.224 --> 01:37.314
She thought maybe
the Al-Khidhir Movement.

01:37.358 --> 01:38.924
I just hope it's not AKM.

01:38.968 --> 01:41.710
Killing Americans is
their Red River Showdown.

01:41.753 --> 01:43.755
That video was a negotiation.

01:43.799 --> 01:46.062
Doesn't mean that a deal closed.JASON:
All right, look.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.760
Ray's trained to do whatever
it takes to escape and survive.

01:48.804 --> 01:51.198
But if whoever has him has
found out he's U.S. military...

01:51.241 --> 01:53.069
They'd have splashed
the execution video

01:53.113 --> 01:54.201
all over <i>Jihad Tonight.</i>

01:54.244 --> 01:55.637
You know what?

01:55.680 --> 01:58.161
Ray's out there somewhere.
He needs us.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.642
We're gonna go find him
and bring our brother home.

02:00.685 --> 02:02.296
Alive.

03:26.467 --> 03:27.642
Davis.

03:27.685 --> 03:28.904
Davis. What are you doing?

03:28.947 --> 03:30.645
Boys are ready for the
next target package

03:30.688 --> 03:32.647
and you're having
a coffee break?I'm still working on it.

03:32.690 --> 03:34.692
Come on. Still working on it?
You're working on the coffee.

03:34.736 --> 03:36.259
You're not working on
the package here...You're back in midseason form

03:36.303 --> 03:37.521
after a couple months off.

03:37.565 --> 03:38.870
I have been up for nearly
a hundred hours

03:38.914 --> 03:40.481
chasing leads on Ray.

03:40.524 --> 03:42.265
Caffeine is necessary.

03:42.309 --> 03:45.268
You're right, you're right.
I get it, I get it.

03:45.312 --> 03:46.965
Look, I know that you're
climbing the walls,

03:47.009 --> 03:49.620
desperate for another door
to kick, but it's not like

03:49.664 --> 03:51.796
the intel gets stronger
as we widen our search.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.842
You're the one who saw
the signs of al-Hazred Jr.

03:53.885 --> 03:56.018
when everyone didn't, so there's
got to be something here.

03:56.061 --> 03:58.455
There's one thing.What's that?

03:58.499 --> 04:00.936
In the HUMINT we used to build
yesterday's raid in Tunis,

04:00.979 --> 04:03.504
there was a single reference
to the city of Sousse.

04:03.547 --> 04:05.288
Sousse? What's there?

04:05.332 --> 04:07.072
Well, that's the question.

04:07.116 --> 04:09.901
It's not a terrorist hotbed,
but it caught my eye

04:09.945 --> 04:11.729
because there's a stray ping
in Sousse in SIGINT

04:11.773 --> 04:14.254
used to build the Annaba raid
the day before.

04:14.297 --> 04:16.691
Maybe the group went underground
'cause all hell's ensued.

04:16.734 --> 04:19.650
Or maybe it's a money
launderer or a weapons dealer

04:19.694 --> 04:21.870
that's got nothing
to do with Ray.

04:21.913 --> 04:24.438
I got a lot of dots
that don't connect.

04:24.481 --> 04:25.874
It's not enough information

04:25.917 --> 04:27.919
to build a legitimate
target package.

04:27.963 --> 04:29.878
Well, I-I understand that,
but, you know,

04:29.921 --> 04:32.141
these legitimate target packages
that we've had

04:32.184 --> 04:34.491
have yielded us nothing
these past few days.

04:34.535 --> 04:37.755
Well, I appreciate that you want
to do anything and everything

04:37.799 --> 04:39.757
to find Ray,
but we can't send operators

04:39.801 --> 04:41.368
out on a wild goose chase.I'll tell you what.

04:41.411 --> 04:43.195
If you have reason for us
to get to Sousse, we're there.

04:43.239 --> 04:44.458
All right? Trust your gut.

04:44.501 --> 04:45.850
Just trust it.

04:47.330 --> 04:48.940
I do.

04:58.254 --> 04:59.342
[men speaking indistinctly]

05:01.388 --> 05:03.346
[whimpers softly]

05:03.390 --> 05:06.218

05:06.262 --> 05:08.264
[grunts, sniffles]

05:28.806 --> 05:30.808
[panting]

05:48.652 --> 05:50.262
[quietly]:
Come on.

05:50.306 --> 05:51.786
DAVIS: The target is a
tobacconist's shophouse

05:51.829 --> 05:54.092
in the city of Sousse.

05:54.136 --> 05:56.573
We looking for Ray or
Full Metal's nicotine fix?

05:56.617 --> 05:58.575
You remember
Salah Behadj?

05:58.619 --> 06:01.143
Yeah, that's the leader of
the Ansar cell that grabbed Ray.

06:01.186 --> 06:02.405
SONNY:
Who wasn't home the night

06:02.449 --> 06:03.450
that Alpha and
Charlie hit the house

06:03.493 --> 06:05.365
and we missed our Bravo 2.

06:05.408 --> 06:07.323
That night his phone
pinged once in Sousse.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.543
At the shophouse?We couldn't triangulate

06:09.586 --> 06:12.197
his location that precisely,
but an Ansar foot soldier

06:12.241 --> 06:14.635
mentioned the tobacconist
under interrogation.

06:14.678 --> 06:16.985
CLAY: So, our best
lead to Ray is based

06:17.028 --> 06:18.508
off of this phone ping
and some random comment

06:18.552 --> 06:20.336
by a dead man walking?Our best lead

06:20.380 --> 06:23.208
is based off of exhaustive
analysis of the available intel.

06:23.252 --> 06:25.167
But even if Behadj
was at the smoke shop,

06:25.210 --> 06:26.386
why hit it three days later?

06:26.429 --> 06:27.474
'Cause we're not looking
for him, all right?

06:27.517 --> 06:30.172
We're looking for Ray.
So let Davis finish.

06:30.215 --> 06:32.740
Go ahead.There's a handful of Tunisian
and foreign fighters

06:32.783 --> 06:35.438
that have been detained in
Sousse over the past six months,

06:35.482 --> 06:37.571
all of them in close
proximity to the shophouse,

06:37.614 --> 06:39.529
which I believe to be

06:39.573 --> 06:41.401
a stop on the AKM ratline

06:41.444 --> 06:43.881
bringing fighters, family
members and hostages

06:43.925 --> 06:46.275
in and out of the country.JASON:
So, if somebody moved

06:46.318 --> 06:48.886
Ray out of Tunisia,
you're saying that it's possible

06:48.930 --> 06:51.889
it was coordinated
out of the shophouse.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.761
THIRTY MIKE:
It's possible.JASON: Yeah.

06:53.804 --> 06:56.677
This isn't intel.
This is just data.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.243
Does the available intel
indicate that Ansar

06:58.287 --> 06:59.854
actually transferred Ray to AKM?

06:59.897 --> 07:01.203
No.

07:01.246 --> 07:04.206
No. All right, so,

07:04.249 --> 07:05.599
we don't know for
sure that this place

07:05.642 --> 07:07.165
is even part of AKM's ratline.

07:07.209 --> 07:09.167
And even if it is,
we don't know that AKM has Ray.

07:09.211 --> 07:10.734
SONNY:
So, who

07:10.778 --> 07:13.520
and what are we actually looking
for in this tobacky shop?

07:13.563 --> 07:15.304
Anything or anyone
that's gonna lead us to Ray.

07:15.347 --> 07:18.481
Yeah, I don't mind fishing
if it ends up getting Ray,

07:18.525 --> 07:22.354
but what do we expect on target?
How many fighters?

07:22.398 --> 07:24.356
We don't know.ERIC:
Task force is also

07:24.400 --> 07:27.577
prepping a new package
for all assault teams on Behadj.

07:27.621 --> 07:29.274
He's resurfaced on Sfax,

07:29.318 --> 07:31.363
but diplomatic issues
are slowing its approval.

07:31.407 --> 07:34.105
Task force is
calling him Target A.

07:34.149 --> 07:36.412
In the meantime,
Bravo has been approved

07:36.456 --> 07:38.893
to hit Target B, our shophouse.

07:38.936 --> 07:41.504
Why not wait for Target A,
an actual terrorist

07:41.548 --> 07:44.420
tied to Ray?Why? Because this is the
most important op of our lives,

07:44.464 --> 07:46.640
and we're gonna turn over
every stone that Davis has

07:46.683 --> 07:48.511
if that means getting Ray back.
You got it?

07:48.555 --> 07:50.382
So, quit bitching,

07:50.426 --> 07:51.949
jock up.

07:57.607 --> 08:00.523
ERIC:
Jace.JASON: Yeah.

08:00.567 --> 08:03.265
Listen, I respect the fact
that you came back

08:03.308 --> 08:05.223
for one last op to save Ray,

08:05.267 --> 08:07.748
but don't make it
Bravo's last, too.

08:07.791 --> 08:10.011
They want him back
just as bad as I do.And that's why

08:10.054 --> 08:12.274
they're following you. Just
be careful where you lead 'em.

08:12.317 --> 08:14.581
Unless you want
sacrificing the whole team

08:14.624 --> 08:15.973
to be your legacy.

08:16.017 --> 08:18.715
I came back to get Ray.
That's what I'm gonna do.

10:20.837 --> 10:23.274
Sonny. Hey, Sonny!
Sonny, take it easy.What?

10:23.318 --> 10:25.450
Stay still right there, huh?

10:25.494 --> 10:27.670
If these guys are Ansar
like Davis says they are,

10:27.714 --> 10:28.671
they could be strapped.

10:28.715 --> 10:29.933
But they aren't. All right?

10:29.977 --> 10:31.413
And they might know
something useful.

10:31.456 --> 10:33.415
Carrots before sticks.

10:33.458 --> 10:35.678
You know, this
desk job of yours

10:35.722 --> 10:38.289
has turned you into a
real pacifist, Mahatma Blondie.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.943
Or maybe this guy's just taking
the punishment right now

10:39.987 --> 10:42.206
'cause you're mad at yourself
for your little fight with Ray.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.165
SONNY:
Oh, it's got nothing
to do with that,

10:44.208 --> 10:45.383
all right?

10:51.346 --> 10:53.000
Just these two.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.177
JASON:
Weapons?No.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.701
No, nobody's carrying
any hardware.

10:58.745 --> 11:00.355
Not sure these fellas are ready
for the end of days.

11:00.398 --> 11:02.836
Davis' theory
might be off.

11:02.879 --> 11:04.751
Brock, collect SSE, will ya?

11:04.794 --> 11:06.927
Trent, Metal,
hold security up front.

11:06.970 --> 11:08.972
The rest of you, take pictures
for Havoc, will you?

11:10.278 --> 11:12.106
Havoc, this is 1.
I pass Barnacle.

11:12.149 --> 11:14.935
Sending pictures
soon for FRS.

11:14.978 --> 11:16.806
DAVIS:
Bravo 1, Havoc copies Barnacle.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.286
Standing by for images.

11:18.329 --> 11:19.853
Gonna take a few to run 'em.There's too many of them

11:19.896 --> 11:22.203
and too few of us to drill down
on all of 'em at once.

11:22.246 --> 11:23.726
Not sure we have
time for that.

11:23.770 --> 11:26.033
Hey, Jace,
who you want to start with?

11:26.076 --> 11:27.643
Got to figure out
who works here.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.819
These two were sleeping
in the office.

11:32.126 --> 11:33.867
Sonny, drill down on him.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.520
Let's go, Q-tip.

11:38.828 --> 11:40.787
What do you say you and I have
a little chat? [grunts]

11:40.830 --> 11:43.703
Clay, you're with me.

11:50.361 --> 11:52.581
I am Zied.

11:58.239 --> 12:01.546
You think I'm a danger to you
because I look like them.

12:01.590 --> 12:03.679
But they are not
my friends.

12:03.723 --> 12:07.639
I'm not asking about your name
or anything about you,

12:07.683 --> 12:10.860
but it appears you spend
more time with these savages.

12:10.904 --> 12:13.167
If you can tell me
what to expect...

12:14.690 --> 12:18.607
Perhaps if I knew
what lies ahead, I can...

12:22.219 --> 12:24.874
[sighs]
Silent treatment.

12:26.441 --> 12:28.399
I know this
very well.

12:29.574 --> 12:32.664
My six-year-old does this
when he's cross with me.

12:33.665 --> 12:36.233
But, eventually,
I always win Sami over.

12:37.234 --> 12:40.455
I'm afraid
I will never see him again.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.284
I am more afraid for him.

12:43.327 --> 12:47.070
He hasn't heard from me
in many days.

12:48.506 --> 12:50.987
What must he think
has happened?

12:52.641 --> 12:56.601
A parent is meant
to worry for their child,

12:56.645 --> 12:59.300
not the other way
around.

13:02.042 --> 13:03.957
[inhales, shudders]

13:09.701 --> 13:11.399
Where are you from?

13:16.360 --> 13:17.361
[speaks Arabic]

13:22.802 --> 13:24.804
[static crackling]

13:40.036 --> 13:42.517
â™ª

14:12.503 --> 14:15.985
[pained cries]

14:25.212 --> 14:26.648
This guy's stonewalling.

14:26.691 --> 14:28.171
Somebody must have said
something about an American

14:28.215 --> 14:30.478
passing through.
Who was it? Come on.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.146
I'm-I'm trying to gain
some rapport.

14:46.189 --> 14:47.843
Okay, Ray doesn't
have time for that.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.279
Have you seen this man?

14:49.323 --> 14:53.457
Huh? Look at me.
Have you seen this man?

14:53.501 --> 14:55.851
THIRTY MIKE:
Get anything?No.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.374
He just stared at me
like he was downwind

14:57.418 --> 14:59.072
from Full Metal on fajita night.

14:59.115 --> 15:01.074
Sit your ass down.

15:01.117 --> 15:02.989
Captain America's taking this
too personal.

15:03.032 --> 15:04.686
Got us running down
rabbit holes,

15:04.729 --> 15:06.601
wasting time and energy.

15:06.644 --> 15:08.255
Yeah, well, if Bravo 1
hadn't come back,

15:08.298 --> 15:11.736
none of us would be here
right now.

15:11.780 --> 15:15.044
You're hoping this is Jordan
coming out of retirement.

15:15.088 --> 15:17.220
What I'm hoping is
you stop bitching about

15:17.264 --> 15:18.874
every damn thing,

15:18.918 --> 15:21.355
and start giving a crap
about finding Ray.

15:21.398 --> 15:23.923
You think I don't care?

15:26.882 --> 15:28.971
I've known him longer than you.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.755
And I wasn't the one
who blew him up

15:30.799 --> 15:32.932
the last time I spoke to him.SONNY: Yeah.

15:37.414 --> 15:39.590
Prime Time's a hell of
an operator.

15:39.634 --> 15:41.549
Same training we had,

15:41.592 --> 15:45.205
smarter than the both of us
put together.

15:45.248 --> 15:49.078
You better believe
he's working the problem.

15:49.122 --> 15:52.864
If there's a way for him
to escape... he'll find it.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.915
Got him to talk
already, huh?

15:59.959 --> 16:01.743
Your charm is undeniable.

16:01.786 --> 16:03.614
How about your guy?Nope,

16:03.658 --> 16:05.965
he's all clammed up and got
no leverage, no carrots.

16:06.008 --> 16:08.576
Havoc, this is 1.
Need FRS update.

16:08.619 --> 16:12.014
Bravo 1, FRS negative.

16:12.058 --> 16:14.277
Copy. Negative on FRS.

16:14.321 --> 16:15.583
ERIC:
Bravo 1, be advised,

16:15.626 --> 16:17.454
Target A has been approved.

16:17.498 --> 16:18.760
What do you got?Office had a bunch of photos,

16:18.803 --> 16:21.241
stolen passports,
visa paperwork.

16:21.284 --> 16:23.591
Forging materials.

16:23.634 --> 16:25.245
This place is definitely
working on the ratline.

16:25.288 --> 16:26.594
Davis was right.

16:26.637 --> 16:27.987
Doesn't mean Ray was here.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.249
Could sweat all these guys
and see what they know.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.380
Don't have time for that

16:30.424 --> 16:31.338
when there's
an actual target to hit.

16:31.381 --> 16:32.904
Hey.

16:32.948 --> 16:35.342
You seen this man recently?
Look at him.

16:35.385 --> 16:37.039
Look at him. Look.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.041
I got cash.
How 'bout a nice vacation?

16:39.085 --> 16:40.303
Whatever you need.
Anyone.

16:40.347 --> 16:41.957
You seen him?
You seen this man recently?

16:42.001 --> 16:43.785
THIRTY MIKE:
We're wasting time.Have you seen him?

16:43.828 --> 16:45.395
Ray's time.Have you seen him?

16:45.439 --> 16:47.267
Coming here looking for answers
was the right thing to do.

16:47.310 --> 16:48.790
Anyone!But Thirty's right.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.574
Absolutely nothing
puts Ray here.

16:50.618 --> 16:52.794
Let me talk to two guys.
That's it. These two.

16:52.837 --> 16:54.274
We stick around, and the rest of
these guys are more useless

16:54.317 --> 16:55.971
than these two,
then we miss Behadj.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.930
THIRTY MIKE:
The guy actually
behind Ray's capture.

17:03.979 --> 17:06.155
Havoc, this is 1.
I got 11 uniform on target.

17:06.199 --> 17:09.028
Request prisoner transport
from partner force.

17:09.071 --> 17:12.553
When that happens,
we'll move on to Target A.

17:12.596 --> 17:14.250
Bravo 1, Havoc copies all.

17:14.294 --> 17:15.556
We'll contact the BAT and get

17:15.599 --> 17:16.948
a prisoner transport
out to target.

17:16.992 --> 17:18.254
JASON [over comm]:
That's a good copy.

17:18.298 --> 17:19.864
Check their wrists.
Make sure they're secure.

17:19.908 --> 17:22.215
Do a med check, too.
I don't want these guys

17:22.258 --> 17:24.347
complaining they were mistreated
when the Tunisians show up.

17:24.391 --> 17:25.827
Got it?

17:30.223 --> 17:31.224
Turn around.

17:36.533 --> 17:37.882
What the hell?

17:40.363 --> 17:43.062
Jace.
Yeah?

17:43.105 --> 17:44.628
Check this out, man.

17:46.587 --> 17:49.068
That's Ray's watch.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.070
Hey... that's Ray's watch!

18:00.775 --> 18:03.082
[breathing erratically]

18:10.219 --> 18:12.743
What have they done?

18:16.312 --> 18:17.487
How can I help you?

18:17.531 --> 18:21.665
Keep your voice down.

18:21.709 --> 18:24.625
You want 'em to come back?No.

18:37.551 --> 18:39.901
I want to know what they
have done to you.

18:48.170 --> 18:51.130
It's not about breaking
your body.

18:53.697 --> 18:58.354
Though pounding on the soles
of your feet,

18:58.398 --> 19:00.965
ripping out your fingernails...

19:02.576 --> 19:04.404
...hurts like hell.

19:07.363 --> 19:10.410
They want to break your mind
and your spirit.

19:13.021 --> 19:16.720
They come randomly.
No schedule.

19:16.764 --> 19:18.418
It's disorienting.

19:20.594 --> 19:22.639
To drive us insane.

19:26.861 --> 19:29.516
How do you stay sane?

19:35.870 --> 19:38.742
Focus on what keeps
your spirit strong.

19:40.918 --> 19:42.659
Faith.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.707
Family.

19:46.750 --> 19:49.144
You have children?

19:52.930 --> 19:54.802
Two.

19:56.282 --> 19:58.327
They were, uh...

20:01.025 --> 20:03.811
They were upset
the night before I left, so...

20:06.292 --> 20:08.990
...I didn't kiss 'em good-bye
the next morning.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.822
Can you imagine that?

20:14.865 --> 20:17.216
Passing on a chance
to kiss your babies.

20:20.654 --> 20:23.309
I'm getting out of here
to make that right.

20:23.352 --> 20:27.313
I met my wife
demonstrating for democracy

20:27.356 --> 20:29.228
in the revolution.

20:31.839 --> 20:35.495
I still love to hear
stories about the protests.

20:35.538 --> 20:37.323
They have happy endings.

20:37.366 --> 20:39.629
Hope...

20:39.673 --> 20:42.980
and hard work wins the day.

20:43.024 --> 20:46.462
But what if I was wrong
to teach him about hope?

20:46.506 --> 20:49.465
No father wants to be the reason
his kid's childhood ends.

20:52.468 --> 20:53.991
But you did the right thing.

20:54.035 --> 20:55.297
I don't know.

20:55.341 --> 20:57.647
Hey, you and me,

20:57.691 --> 21:00.171
we need that lesson
now more than ever.

21:00.215 --> 21:01.956
That...

21:01.999 --> 21:05.307
that hope,
that we'll see our family again,

21:05.351 --> 21:07.527
that's what gets us
through this.

21:09.746 --> 21:14.273
We have got to stay strong...

21:14.316 --> 21:16.057
for them.

21:17.537 --> 21:19.365
For them.

21:26.720 --> 21:29.331
[speaking Arabic]

21:29.375 --> 21:30.506
Please use English.

21:30.550 --> 21:33.292
Your butchered Arabic
hurts my ears.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.076
Tell us about the watch, Faraz.

21:36.512 --> 21:38.427
You went through our IDs.

21:38.471 --> 21:40.081
JASON: Oh,
you're smart, man.

21:40.124 --> 21:41.430
I like dealing
with smart people.

21:41.474 --> 21:43.214
Dumb people,
they just annoy me. So...

21:43.258 --> 21:44.999
tell us about
the watch.

21:45.042 --> 21:47.393
Numbers are big, easy to read.

21:47.436 --> 21:48.437
Where'd you get it?

21:48.481 --> 21:49.569
It was a gift.From who?

21:49.612 --> 21:50.787
Whom.

21:50.831 --> 21:52.876
Someone who thought
I deserved it.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.530
Why would you
deserve it?

21:54.574 --> 21:56.532
Why wouldn't I?

21:56.576 --> 21:58.534
Do you know
it has a thermometer?

21:58.578 --> 21:59.970
No air conditioning here,

22:00.014 --> 22:02.364
and now I know
exactly how hot it gets.

22:02.408 --> 22:04.584
31 degrees
in the middle of the night.

22:04.627 --> 22:06.455
You know, some people
find that uncomfortable.

22:06.499 --> 22:08.109
Do you?

22:08.152 --> 22:10.677
Would you
like water?
I would.

22:10.720 --> 22:13.244
It's not going to change
my answers about the watch.

22:13.288 --> 22:15.246
Let's talk about you, shall we?

22:15.290 --> 22:17.727
There's more people out there
than there are bags.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.773
Married couples pack together.We went through
the bags.

22:19.816 --> 22:21.296
One of them had
women's clothes.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.776
You should not
have touched those.

22:22.819 --> 22:24.386
My calculations,
that means two people

22:24.430 --> 22:26.083
aren't traveling--
they work here.

22:26.127 --> 22:28.085
CLAY:
Maybe you'd be
less concerned

22:28.129 --> 22:30.087
about the air conditioning if
you were just passing through.

22:30.131 --> 22:32.263
Maybe I'm simply
making conversation.

22:32.307 --> 22:34.048
Okay, so,
if you don't work here,

22:34.091 --> 22:35.919
that means you're traveling
to the fight.

22:35.963 --> 22:38.966
[chuckles]:
And I'm sorry, I just...

22:39.009 --> 22:40.663
I don't see that.

22:40.707 --> 22:43.579
A fighter's ability comes
from his soul, not his body.Really?

22:43.623 --> 22:45.451
So if I gave you my knife,
what would you do with it?

22:47.148 --> 22:48.758
I'd slit your throat.

22:48.802 --> 22:51.587
Now, that is the first
honest answer we've had.

22:51.631 --> 22:54.068
Okay, let's try two for two.

22:54.111 --> 22:55.548
Have you seen him?

22:55.591 --> 22:57.419
Unless we're talking
about the weather,

22:57.463 --> 23:00.291
I have nothing to say.All right, we're done here.
Let's go. Come on.

23:00.335 --> 23:02.424
Go. Get out. Sonny?Yep?

23:02.468 --> 23:03.730
Keep this guy secluded.

23:03.773 --> 23:05.688
Don't give him any water,
will you?Copy, boss.

23:05.732 --> 23:07.386
The hell was that
about the knife?

23:07.429 --> 23:09.953
Trying to get a read on him.
So, what do you think?

23:09.997 --> 23:11.520
Well, good English.

23:11.564 --> 23:13.392
When you mentioned
the women's clothes,

23:13.435 --> 23:15.394
he's definitely more
religious than secular.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.396
I agree with you, he's not
on his way to the front,

23:17.439 --> 23:18.919
but he could be
in charge here.

23:18.962 --> 23:20.181
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

23:20.224 --> 23:21.661
Support teams
have been withdrawn.

23:21.704 --> 23:23.880
Bravo is now taking
Target A solo.

23:23.924 --> 23:25.186
What is your ETA?

23:25.229 --> 23:26.448
JASON:
Havoc, this is 1.

23:26.492 --> 23:27.841
We're still digging. How copy?

23:27.884 --> 23:29.233
It's gonna be hard
convincing him to leave

23:29.277 --> 23:30.844
when he doesn't know
how Ray's watch got there.

23:30.887 --> 23:32.498
Yeah, worst thing
that could happen

23:32.541 --> 23:35.544
is Jason doesn't get his answers
and we lose our shot at Behadj.

23:35.588 --> 23:37.981
Yeah, Bravo 1, understand
you need more time on target.

23:38.025 --> 23:39.896
Make it quick.Havoc, we need to delay

23:39.940 --> 23:42.072
the partner force coming
for the prisoner transport.

23:42.116 --> 23:43.683
DAVIS: We're doing
what we can, Bravo 1,

23:43.726 --> 23:45.685
but 11 uniform on target got
the Tunisians' attention.

23:45.728 --> 23:47.338
With Charlie
and Foxtrot tied up,

23:47.382 --> 23:48.514
if we don't move on Behadj,
nobody gets him.

23:48.557 --> 23:50.080
Faraz is the key.

23:50.124 --> 23:52.648
He either crossed paths with Ray
or knows somebody who did.

23:52.692 --> 23:54.345
We have no many hands
this watch passed through

23:54.389 --> 23:56.696
before he ended up with it--
this could be a dead end.

23:56.739 --> 23:59.176
He had that watch 'cause
he's important to someone.

23:59.220 --> 24:01.004
You think
he's not in charge here?

24:01.048 --> 24:03.833
Threatening to slit my throat?
Come on, poser, he's arrogant.

24:03.877 --> 24:06.009
Trying too hard
to prove his self-worth.

24:06.053 --> 24:08.011
If he's working for someone,
how are we gonna find out, man?

24:08.055 --> 24:09.230
He knows not to say anything.

24:09.273 --> 24:11.058
So you want to pop smoke
and go for Behadj?

24:12.929 --> 24:15.454
Whatever you think's best,
man-- I'll follow your lead.

24:17.717 --> 24:21.024
I lead... let's go
find Faraz's boss.

24:23.984 --> 24:25.986
[panting]

24:36.431 --> 24:38.433
[chuckling softly]

24:52.229 --> 24:54.231
[speaking Arabic]

25:02.936 --> 25:05.504
[door slams]

25:08.158 --> 25:10.770
How do you go through
something like this...

25:10.813 --> 25:13.729
and think you'll see
your children again?

25:13.773 --> 25:16.210
There's no hope in that room.

25:16.253 --> 25:18.299
You have to believe there's
light at the end of the tunnel.

25:24.044 --> 25:26.873
It's the only way.

25:39.886 --> 25:41.888
Is that where
you see a light?

25:44.978 --> 25:46.980
It may be small, but...

25:49.025 --> 25:51.201
...makes me feel
like I have some control.

25:51.245 --> 25:53.073
[door bangs]

25:53.116 --> 25:54.814
Oh, no.

25:54.857 --> 25:56.903
No, not again.

25:56.946 --> 25:58.861
They can't be coming back
so soon.

26:02.822 --> 26:05.215
[shouting in Arabic]

26:09.655 --> 26:11.570
Here's your special request.

26:15.051 --> 26:17.053
Kitchen closes in ten.

26:19.316 --> 26:20.753
Thank you.

26:20.796 --> 26:22.581
CLAY:
Guess Faraz wasn't
thirsty after all.

26:22.624 --> 26:24.191
JASON:
Unless he needs permission.

26:25.453 --> 26:27.455
Let's see
who he's waiting on.

26:37.117 --> 26:39.119
Think we found the boss.

26:44.733 --> 26:48.694
JASON: Look at that--
that's impressive, Mr. Nasri.

26:48.737 --> 26:50.173
Hid in plain sight
in your office.

26:50.217 --> 26:52.741
Too bad Faraz gave you up.

26:52.785 --> 26:54.700
Faraz is not as smart
as he thinks he is.

26:54.743 --> 26:56.658
So are you gonna have to tell
your AKM bosses

26:56.702 --> 26:58.355
that he messed up or is that
something you can handle?

26:58.399 --> 27:00.270
Look, I completely
understand how frustrating

27:00.314 --> 27:01.707
middle management
can be.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.883
I am an independent businessman.

27:03.926 --> 27:05.754
A talented one when it comes
to smuggling people.

27:05.798 --> 27:08.670
But we don't care where those
folks outside are going, right?

27:08.714 --> 27:10.846
I do, I do have
one question though.

27:10.890 --> 27:13.370
Now I assume that Faraz
sleeps near the room

27:13.414 --> 27:15.372
to keep an eye on the guests.

27:15.416 --> 27:18.332
Why was one of them
in here with you, the boss?

27:20.334 --> 27:22.118
Is that your one question?

27:22.162 --> 27:24.294
It's been bothering me
since we figured out who's who.

27:24.338 --> 27:26.993
He wouldn't share a room
with the women.

27:27.036 --> 27:29.038
The curtain wasn't enough
for him.

27:31.519 --> 27:33.869
You thought I was going
to ask something else?

27:35.349 --> 27:38.134
You've been waving a picture
around since you arrived.

27:38.178 --> 27:40.659
You were interested
in Faraz's watch.

27:40.702 --> 27:42.835
You know anything
about either one?

27:42.878 --> 27:45.751
When you go fishing,
you need better bait.

27:45.794 --> 27:47.491
Wouldn't you rather be fishing
instead of, uh,

27:47.535 --> 27:48.971
making travel arrangements

27:49.015 --> 27:51.147
for people you
don't even like?

27:51.191 --> 27:53.715
Look, I-I believe that
you're a businessman.

27:53.759 --> 27:55.369
Because if you were really
committed to the fight,

27:55.412 --> 27:57.110
you wouldn't be operating
out of this office.

27:57.153 --> 28:00.504
I would prefer my family to live
in a world with no bloodshed.

28:02.550 --> 28:05.988
But my business partners
value my discretion.

28:06.032 --> 28:10.645
And as you know,
these are not people to betray.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.603
We can protect you.

28:12.647 --> 28:14.257
We can protect your family.

28:14.301 --> 28:16.390
If you tell us
what we want to know.

28:18.609 --> 28:21.569
You are in no position
to make any offer.

28:21.612 --> 28:24.485
You already told me
you're middle management.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.535
It's just an act.

28:31.579 --> 28:33.494
Been through it
four times before.

28:33.537 --> 28:35.670
Just deep breaths.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.716
Stay with me.

28:55.429 --> 28:57.779
[speaking in Arabic]

29:17.146 --> 29:19.148
[speaking Arabic]

29:51.833 --> 29:55.228
How could you go on as
though nothing has happened?

29:55.271 --> 29:57.099
That was worse
than physical pain.

29:57.143 --> 29:59.449
I told you.

29:59.493 --> 30:01.016
Think about your son.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.626
I'd rather
kill myself

30:02.670 --> 30:05.412
than let those people
have power over me and Sami.

30:12.767 --> 30:14.769
I know that feeling.

30:19.382 --> 30:21.384
I've had it myself.

30:30.045 --> 30:32.613
But we have power, too.

30:32.656 --> 30:34.136
[laughs]

30:34.180 --> 30:36.182
What, what power?

30:37.923 --> 30:39.794
Knowledge.

30:41.709 --> 30:44.494
They made a mistake
when they walked us in together.

30:46.018 --> 30:48.498
See, now that we know
there are at least five of them

30:48.542 --> 30:49.978
and each only has one weapon.

30:50.022 --> 30:52.981
This is how
your mind works?

30:55.636 --> 30:57.290
Does that mean
we can escape?

30:57.333 --> 30:59.858
Is that what that is for?

31:04.645 --> 31:06.865
I think we have a better shot
than most people

31:06.908 --> 31:08.475
in our situation would, but...

31:08.518 --> 31:10.607
we need a way
to call for help.

31:13.088 --> 31:15.090
A phone or radio.

31:16.526 --> 31:20.922
Have you noticed static when
they walk you to the other room?

31:20.966 --> 31:22.881
Yes.

31:22.924 --> 31:25.361
Yes. What is it?

31:25.405 --> 31:27.668
That's what we need to find out.

31:27.711 --> 31:29.583
Okay.

31:30.584 --> 31:33.500
Bravo 1, this is Havoc,
give me a sitrep.

31:33.543 --> 31:35.545
Come on, get up.
Get your ass up. Go.

31:35.589 --> 31:37.025
Havoc, this is 1,
we need more time on target.

31:37.069 --> 31:39.027
Yeah, I hope that means
someone's talking,

31:39.071 --> 31:40.550
'cause the window's
closing on Target A.

31:40.594 --> 31:41.943
The assault on Behadj
isn't the only clock

31:41.987 --> 31:43.031
that they need to worry about.

31:43.075 --> 31:44.728
Bravo 1, be advised

31:44.772 --> 31:46.556
you have local authorities
en route to your pos

31:46.600 --> 31:48.602
to take custody of detainees.

31:48.645 --> 31:50.821
I thought you were
buying us more time.DAVIS: We tried.

31:50.865 --> 31:52.736
But the Tunisians want to put a
lid on this as soon as they can.

31:52.780 --> 31:55.739
They're responsible
for anyone detained.

31:55.783 --> 31:57.567
What's their ETA?

31:57.611 --> 31:59.918
Approximately 15 mikes.

32:03.095 --> 32:05.967
I copy, 15 mikes. Bravo out.

32:08.448 --> 32:10.058
On me.

32:14.845 --> 32:16.586
Clock's running out.
We need a buzzer beater.

32:16.630 --> 32:18.849
What's on your mind, Jace?Nasri knows something.

32:18.893 --> 32:20.416
Faraz, too.THIRTY MIKE:
That smoke shop's

32:20.460 --> 32:21.983
giving you a contact high
you think we're getting anything

32:22.027 --> 32:23.898
from those dudes.CLAY:
Could go at Nasri again,

32:23.942 --> 32:25.813
sweeten the offer.JASON:
Nah, he's more afraid of AKM

32:25.856 --> 32:26.988
than he is of us.

32:27.032 --> 32:28.381
Not gonna make a deal.

32:28.424 --> 32:29.948
Can't give a carrot
to someone who ain't hungry.

32:31.471 --> 32:32.907
How about we give them
the stick?

32:34.474 --> 32:35.954
Enhanced interrogation?

32:35.997 --> 32:37.259
Standard interrogation's
got us nothing.

32:37.303 --> 32:38.521
THIRTY MIKE:
Lot of people say EITs

32:38.565 --> 32:40.306
get that same result.

32:40.349 --> 32:42.873
Doesn't matter if it works
or not, it's illegal.

32:42.917 --> 32:45.398
What, are we gonna sit back and
watch Ray get his throat slit

32:45.441 --> 32:47.400
because we're afraid
of some kind of court-martial?

32:47.443 --> 32:49.097
SONNY:
This is the ticking
time bomb scenario

32:49.141 --> 32:50.577
that EIT is for.

32:50.620 --> 32:51.882
Mm-hmm.

32:51.926 --> 32:53.536
They do it to us.

32:53.580 --> 32:55.147
Turnabout is fair play.

32:55.190 --> 32:56.365
We got to be better than that.

32:56.409 --> 32:57.801
Better than them.

32:57.845 --> 32:59.194
If-if we sink down
to their level...

32:59.238 --> 33:01.196
If we don't sink to their level,
Ray's got no shot.

33:10.423 --> 33:11.815
CLAY:
Team leader who taught me

33:11.859 --> 33:14.122
what this job means would
never cross this line.

33:14.166 --> 33:17.212
That line got moved when
those dirtbags got Ray.

33:17.256 --> 33:19.301
Think of your legacy
as an operator.

33:19.345 --> 33:21.825
Every good thing that you ever
did on the teams gets erased

33:21.869 --> 33:23.392
by this one act.

33:23.436 --> 33:26.395
Every good thing gets thrown out
if I don't get Ray back.

33:26.439 --> 33:28.745
I mean-- I-I want
to find him, too, but...All right, look,

33:28.789 --> 33:32.271
my career is over when I get
Ray back, yours isn't.

33:32.314 --> 33:34.012
You're on thin ice
with Command as it is.

33:34.055 --> 33:36.014
I'm not bringing you down
with me. You, either.

33:36.057 --> 33:37.624
You know, I just keep thinking
about how Ray reacted

33:37.667 --> 33:39.321
when we all wanted
to lie for him

33:39.365 --> 33:41.149
when we thought
he threw that homewrecker,

33:41.193 --> 33:44.109
and I'm just not sure
he'd want us

33:44.152 --> 33:46.024
to trade our honor for his life.

33:46.067 --> 33:47.329
Especially you, Jace.

33:47.373 --> 33:50.028
If I don't do whatever it takes
to get Ray back,

33:50.071 --> 33:52.856
his family will
see him executed.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.510
I'll have no honor to speak of.

33:55.555 --> 33:57.035
Yeah, we're the only one
thinking, uh--

33:57.078 --> 34:00.038
I'd rather be bounced
trying to save his life

34:00.081 --> 34:02.344
than regret letting
you hang alone.

34:02.388 --> 34:05.130
I'm in.

34:05.173 --> 34:08.655
This here is what separates us
from the enemy.

34:08.698 --> 34:10.526
We have a code
and they don't.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.876
Sonny's right, Jace.
Ray wouldn't want this.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.791
Oh. It's good he's not here
to stop me, then.

34:24.018 --> 34:25.411
Let's go.

34:30.807 --> 34:33.071
I don't suppose
you'll tell me why

34:33.114 --> 34:37.292
you're so calm
about all this.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.993
I am not calm.

34:45.257 --> 34:47.259
I'm scared.

34:50.131 --> 34:52.090
I'm scared every minute.

34:52.133 --> 34:55.919
It takes everything I have
not to show it to them.

34:55.963 --> 34:58.183
I cannot give them
the satisfaction

34:58.226 --> 35:00.228
of knowing
they're getting to me.

35:04.580 --> 35:07.105
It was worse when I was alone.

35:09.455 --> 35:11.370
But yet you endured.

35:11.413 --> 35:13.763
I have a mantra.

35:17.027 --> 35:19.813
"They will not break me."

35:19.856 --> 35:23.556
[quietly]:
"They will not break me."

35:25.775 --> 35:29.866
They will not... break me.

35:32.304 --> 35:33.740
That's it, brother.

35:35.742 --> 35:37.352
You got this.

35:42.836 --> 35:44.838
[door opens]

35:47.754 --> 35:49.843
Sit down. Sit down.

36:04.205 --> 36:06.164
[tape tearing in distance]

36:11.299 --> 36:13.171
War is hell, man.

36:21.875 --> 36:24.878
Bravo 4, this is 6.

36:24.921 --> 36:26.836
Can Metal and Brock
hold security without you?

36:26.880 --> 36:28.011
TRENT:
Affirm.

36:28.055 --> 36:30.666
Great. Come meet me here

36:30.710 --> 36:31.667
at the DCP.

36:31.711 --> 36:33.016
Copy that. Moving.

36:36.063 --> 36:37.717
[static crackling]

36:45.899 --> 36:47.335
What do you guys need?

36:47.379 --> 36:48.902
You and Thirty
hold security here.

36:49.903 --> 36:51.034
Come on. Let's talk.

36:51.078 --> 36:52.906
Let's go.

36:56.779 --> 36:59.173
Come here. Come here, sit down.
Sit down for a second.

37:00.566 --> 37:04.265
Mr. Nasri really likes you,
Faraz. You know that?

37:04.309 --> 37:06.441
He wouldn't have given you an
American's watch if he didn't.

37:06.485 --> 37:08.878
So if you know
anything, tell me,

37:08.922 --> 37:11.054
and I can stop them
from what they're doing

37:11.098 --> 37:12.969
to your friend
in the other room.

37:13.013 --> 37:15.798
He is not my friend.
He's a fool.

37:25.547 --> 37:26.940
Did you smell the food,

37:26.983 --> 37:28.333
when we passed the static?[shushes]

37:28.376 --> 37:29.856
Not now.

37:38.734 --> 37:41.171
Let's start here.

37:42.347 --> 37:43.652
You don't like Nasri?

37:45.175 --> 37:46.960
You think he's not
a true Muslim.

37:47.003 --> 37:48.701
He just, he takes money
from your brothers

37:48.744 --> 37:51.138
doing the fighting and mocks
their cause behind their backs?

37:51.181 --> 37:53.227
Yet you're gonna be

37:53.271 --> 37:55.142
one who's enduring
the pain and suffering next

37:55.185 --> 37:57.144
because you're sitting here
protecting him.

37:57.187 --> 37:59.712
It will be an honor
to bleed for my brothers.

38:13.421 --> 38:15.467
Think of your son.

38:16.598 --> 38:18.513
[man speaking Arabic]

38:21.168 --> 38:22.604
JASON:
It's a real simple question...

38:24.824 --> 38:26.521
...when you think about
it. The right answer

38:26.565 --> 38:27.914
will put a stop to all this.

38:30.438 --> 38:31.874
Whatever you do to me,
it won't be as bad

38:31.918 --> 38:34.355
as what happens
if I betray my partners.

38:34.399 --> 38:36.139
Unless you are more like them
than I thought.

38:36.183 --> 38:37.489
[pliers clicking]

38:40.361 --> 38:42.232
Being part of the cause
is important to you, huh?

38:42.276 --> 38:43.451
Supporting your brothers?

38:43.495 --> 38:44.800
But you can't contribute
the way you'd like.

38:44.844 --> 38:46.280
That right?

38:46.324 --> 38:47.629
'Cause Nasri's
holding you back.

38:47.673 --> 38:48.804
I know what it's like
to work for someone

38:48.848 --> 38:50.110
who doesn't listen to me.

38:50.153 --> 38:51.285
How many times
has he overruled you

38:51.329 --> 38:52.330
even though you knew better?

38:52.373 --> 38:53.418
Every day.

38:53.461 --> 38:54.984
It's infuriating.

38:55.028 --> 38:56.464
Being ignored
when you know what's best.

38:59.162 --> 39:01.164
[panting]

39:04.385 --> 39:06.779
No, no...

39:06.822 --> 39:08.607
JASON [straining]:
Hey. Come on. Open them up.

39:08.650 --> 39:09.825
Open them up.

39:09.869 --> 39:11.436
I'm not weak like you.

39:11.479 --> 39:14.264
When Nasri is wrong,
I do what's right.

39:14.308 --> 39:16.963
[thudding in distance]

39:18.921 --> 39:20.706
You know,

39:20.749 --> 39:23.186
I was wrong before.
You're not gonna have
to bleed for your brothers.

39:23.230 --> 39:25.014
We know that Nasri's
the only real player here.

39:25.058 --> 39:27.669
"Player"?Like, the leader, someone
in charge, someone of value.

39:27.713 --> 39:28.844
Not a little clerk like you.

39:28.888 --> 39:29.932
I am a player, too.

39:29.976 --> 39:31.847
Oh, really?
Forging passports?

39:31.891 --> 39:33.501
You get a watch, he gets
the glory from your brothers

39:33.545 --> 39:35.068
for delivering the American.If it wasn't for me,

39:35.111 --> 39:36.591
my brothers wouldn't
have the Americans.

39:36.635 --> 39:39.507
That's right. That's right,
they wouldn't have the American,

39:39.551 --> 39:41.553
because you had
a better idea than Mr. Nasri.

39:43.119 --> 39:44.425
But your heroes?
They're gonna give him

39:44.469 --> 39:46.209
all the credit
because he's the boss.

39:46.253 --> 39:48.037
They're never gonna know
that you're the real ally here,

39:48.081 --> 39:50.388
and they're always just gonna
look at you like you're Nasri's

39:50.431 --> 39:53.129
little errand boy.Nasri wanted to move them
from here yesterday afternoon.

39:53.173 --> 39:56.176
But too many eyes,
so I changed it to El Kantaoui.

39:59.309 --> 40:01.050
I am very good.All Bravo elements,

40:01.094 --> 40:03.009
this is Bravo 6.You will never find them.

40:03.052 --> 40:04.967
Tango on target just informed us
that Bravo 2 was transferred

40:05.011 --> 40:06.534
from El Kantaoui
yesterday afternoon.

40:08.014 --> 40:09.972
I say again,
Bravo 2 was transferred

40:10.016 --> 40:12.018
from El Kantaoui.

40:19.547 --> 40:21.549
[man speaking Arabic]

40:46.531 --> 40:48.533
[panting]

41:00.936 --> 41:02.764
You all right, Jace?

41:10.380 --> 41:12.600
I stopped it in time?Uh, damnedest thing, man.

41:12.644 --> 41:13.906
he walked right up to the line

41:13.949 --> 41:16.038
and stopped himself
from crossing it.

41:16.082 --> 41:18.693
That office in there, well,
it's a little worse for wear.

41:18.737 --> 41:20.173
[chuckles]

41:28.877 --> 41:30.052
JASON:
Hey.

41:30.096 --> 41:32.054
Good work.

41:33.839 --> 41:36.015
Let's go get Ray.

41:52.161 --> 41:54.120
[metallic tapping]

41:54.163 --> 41:56.165
[static crackling]

42:06.959 --> 42:08.961
[wind whistling]
