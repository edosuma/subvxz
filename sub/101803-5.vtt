Is that where
you see a light?

25:44.978 --> 25:46.980
It may be small, but...

25:49.025 --> 25:51.201
...makes me feel
like I have some control.

25:51.245 --> 25:53.073
[door bangs]

25:53.116 --> 25:54.814
Oh, no.

25:54.857 --> 25:56.903
No, not again.

25:56.946 --> 25:58.861
They can't be coming back
so soon.

26:02.822 --> 26:05.215
[shouting in Arabic]

26:09.655 --> 26:11.570
Here's your special request.

26:15.051 --> 26:17.053
Kitchen closes in ten.

26:19.316 --> 26:20.753
Thank you.

26:20.796 --> 26:22.581
CLAY:
Guess Faraz wasn't
thirsty after all.

26:22.624 --> 26:24.191
JASON:
Unless he needs permission.

26:25.453 --> 26:27.455
Let's see
who he's waiting on.

26:37.117 --> 26:39.119
Think we found the boss.

26:44.733 --> 26:48.694
JASON: Look at that--
that's impressive, Mr. Nasri.

26:48.737 --> 26:50.173
Hid in plain sight
in your office.

26:50.217 --> 26:52.741
Too bad Faraz gave you up.

26:52.785 --> 26:54.700
Faraz is not as smart
as he thinks he is.

26:54.743 --> 26:56.658
So are you gonna have to tell
your AKM bosses

26:56.702 --> 26:58.355
that he messed up or is that
something you can handle?

26:58.399 --> 27:00.270
Look, I completely
understand how frustrating

27:00.314 --> 27:01.707
middle management
can be.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.883
I am an independent businessman.

27:03.926 --> 27:05.754
A talented one when it comes
to smuggling people.

27:05.798 --> 27:08.670
But we don't care where those
folks outside are going, right?

27:08.714 --> 27:10.846
I do, I do have
one question though.

27:10.890 --> 27:13.370
Now I assume that Faraz
sleeps near the room

27:13.414 --> 27:15.372
to keep an eye on the guests.

27:15.416 --> 27:18.332
Why was one of them
in here with you, the boss?

27:20.334 --> 27:22.118
Is that your one question?

27:22.162 --> 27:24.294
It's been bothering me
since we figured out who's who.

27:24.338 --> 27:26.993
He wouldn't share a room
with the women.

27:27.036 --> 27:29.038
The curtain wasn't enough
for him.

27:31.519 --> 27:33.869
You thought I was going
to ask something else?

27:35.349 --> 27:38.134
You've been waving a picture
around since you arrived.

27:38.178 --> 27:40.659
You were interested
in Faraz's watch.

27:40.702 --> 27:42.835
You know anything
about either one?

27:42.878 --> 27:45.751
When you go fishing,
you need better bait.

27:45.794 --> 27:47.491
Wouldn't you rather be fishing
instead of, uh,

27:47.535 --> 27:48.971
making travel arrangements

27:49.015 --> 27:51.147
for people you
don't even like?

27:51.191 --> 27:53.715
Look, I-I believe that
you're a businessman.

27:53.759 --> 27:55.369
Because if you were really
committed to the fight,

27:55.412 --> 27:57.110
you wouldn't be operating
out of this office.

27:57.153 --> 28:00.504
I would prefer my family to live
in a world with no bloodshed.

28:02.550 --> 28:05.988
But my business partners
value my discretion.

28:06.032 --> 28:10.645
And as you know,
these are not people to betray.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.603
We can protect you.

28:12.647 --> 28:14.257
We can protect your family.

28:14.301 --> 28:16.390
If you tell us
what we want to know.

28:18.609 --> 28:21.569
You are in no position
to make any offer.

28:21.612 --> 28:24.485
You already told me
you're middle management.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.535
It's just an act.

28:31.579 --> 28:33.494
Been through it
four times before.

28:33.537 --> 28:35.670
Just deep breaths.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.716
Stay with me.

28:55.429 --> 28:57.779
[speaking in Arabic]

29:17.146 --> 29:19.148
[speaking Arabic]

29:51.833 --> 29:55.228
How could you go on as
though nothing has happened?

29:55.271 --> 29:57.099
That was worse
than physical pain.

29:57.143 --> 29:59.449
I told you.

29:59.493 --> 30:01.016
Think about your son.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.626
I'd rather
kill myself

30:02.670 --> 30:05.412
than let those people
have power over me and Sami.

30:12.767 --> 30:14.769
I know that feeling.

30:19.382 --> 30:21.384
I've had it myself.

30:30.045 --> 30:32.613
But we have power, too.

30:32.656 --> 30:34.136
[laughs]

30:34.180 --> 30:36.182
What, what power?

30:37.923 --> 30:39.794
Knowledge.

30:41.709 --> 30:44.494
They made a mistake
when they walked us in together.

30:46.018 --> 30:48.498
See, now that we know
there are at least five of them

30:48.542 --> 30:49.978
and each only has one weapon.

30:50.022 --> 30:52.981
This is how
your mind works?

30:55.636 --> 30:57.290
Does that mean
we can escape?

30:57.333 --> 30:59.858
Is that what that is for?

31:04.645 --> 31:06.865
I think we have a better shot
than most people

31:06.908 --> 31:08.475
in our situation would, but...

31:08.518 --> 31:10.607
we need a way
to call for help.

31:13.088 --> 31:15.090
A phone or radio.

31:16.526 --> 31:20.922
Have you noticed static when
they walk you to the other room?

31:20.966 --> 31:22.881
Yes.

31:22.924 --> 31:25.361
Yes. What is it?

31:25.405 --> 31:27.668
That's what we need to find out.

31:27.711 --> 31:29.583
Okay.

31:30.584 --> 31:33.500
Bravo 1, this is Havoc,
give me a sitrep.

31:33.543 --> 31:35.545
Come on, get up.
Get your ass up. Go.

31:35.589 --> 31:37.025
Havoc, this is 1,
we need more time on target.

31:37.069 --> 31:39.027
Yeah, I hope that means
someone's talking,

31:39.071 --> 31:40.550
'cause the window's
closing on Target A.

31:40.594 --> 31:41.943
The assault on Behadj
isn't the only clock

31:41.987 --> 31:43.031
that they need to worry about.

31:43.075 --> 31:44.728
Bravo 1, be advised

31:44.772 --> 31:46.556
you have local authorities
en route to your pos

31:46.600 --> 31:48.602
to take custody of detainees.

31:48.645 --> 31:50.821
I thought you were
buying us more time.DAVIS: We tried.

31:50.865 --> 31:52.736
But the Tunisians want to put a
lid on this as soon as they can.

31:52.780 --> 31:55.739
They're responsible
for anyone detained.

31:55.783 --> 31:57.567
What's their ETA?

31:57.611 --> 31:59.918
Approximately 15 mikes.

32:03.095 --> 32:05.967
I copy, 15 mikes. Bravo out.

32:08.448 --> 32:10.058
On me.

32:14.845 --> 32:16.586
Clock's running out.
We need a buzzer beater.

32:16.630 --> 32:18.849
What's on your mind, Jace?Nasri knows something.

32:18.893 --> 32:20.416
Faraz, too.THIRTY MIKE:
That smoke shop's

32:20.460 --> 32:21.983
giving you a contact high
you think we're getting anything

32:22.027 --> 32:23.898
from those dudes.CLAY:
Could go at Nasri again,

32:23.942 --> 32:25.813
sweeten the offer.JASON:
Nah, he's more afraid of AKM

32:25.856 --> 32:26.988
than he is of us.

32:27.032 --> 32:28.381
Not gonna make a deal.

32:28.424 --> 32:29.948
Can't give a carrot
to someone who ain't hungry.

32:31.471 --> 32:32.907
How about we give them
the stick?

32:34.474 --> 32:35.954
Enhanced interrogation?

32:35.997 --> 32:37.259
Standard interrogation's
got us nothing.

32:37.303 --> 32:38.521
THIRTY MIKE:
Lot of people say EITs

32:38.565 --> 32:40.306
get that same result.

32:40.349 --> 32:42.873
Doesn't matter if it works
or not, it's illegal.

32:42.917 --> 32:45.398
What, are we gonna sit back and
watch Ray get his throat slit

32:45.441 --> 32:47.400
because we're afraid
of some kind of court-martial?

32:47.443 --> 32:49.097
SONNY:
This is the ticking
time bomb scenario

32:49.141 --> 32:50.577
that EIT is for.

32:50.620 --> 32:51.882
Mm-hmm.

32:51.926 --> 32:53.536
They do it to us.

32:53.580 --> 32:55.147
Turnabout is fair play.

32:55.190 --> 32:56.365
We got to be better than that.

32:56.409 --> 32:57.801
Better than them.

32:57.845 --> 32:59.194
If-if we sink down
to their level...

32:59.238 --> 33:01.196
If we don't sink to their level,
Ray's got no shot.

33:10.423 --> 33:11.815
CLAY:
Team leader who taught me

33:11.859 --> 33:14.122
what this job means would
never cross this line.

33:14.166 --> 33:17.212
That line got moved when
those dirtbags got Ray.

33:17.256 --> 33:19.301
Think of your legacy
as an operator.

33:19.345 --> 33:21.825
Every good thing that you ever
did on the teams gets erased

33:21.869 --> 33:23.392
by this one act.

33:23.436 --> 33:26.395
Every good thing gets thrown out
if I don't get Ray back.

33:26.439 --> 33:28.745
I mean-- I-I want
to find him, too, but...All right, look,

33:28.789 --> 33:32.271
my career is over when I get
Ray back, yours isn't.

33:32.314 --> 33:34.012
You're on thin ice
with Command as it is.

33:34.055 --> 33:36.014
I'm not bringing you down
with me. You, either.

33:36.057 --> 33:37.624
You know, I just keep thinking
about how Ray reacted

33:37.667 --> 33:39.321
when we all wanted
to lie for him

33:39.365 --> 33:41.149
when we thought
he threw that homewrecker,

33:41.193 --> 33:44.109
and I'm just not sure
he'd want us

33:44.152 --> 33:46.024
to trade our honor for his life.

33:46.067 --> 33:47.329
Especially you, Jace.

33:47.373 --> 33:50.028
If I don't do whatever it takes
to get Ray back,

33:50.071 --> 33:52.856
his family will
see him executed.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.510
I'll have no honor to speak of.

33:55.555 --> 33:57.035
Yeah, we're the only one
thinking, uh--

33:57.078 --> 34:00.038
I'd rather be bounced
trying to save his life

34:00.081 --> 34:02.344
than regret letting
you hang alone.

34:02.388 --> 34:05.130
I'm in.

34:05.173 --> 34:08.655
This here is what separates us
from the enemy.

34:08.698 --> 34:10.526
We have a code
and they don't.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.876
Sonny's right, Jace.
Ray wouldn't want this.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.791
Oh. It's good he's not here
to stop me, then.

34:24.018 --> 34:25.411
Let's go.

34:30.807 --> 34:33.071
I don't suppose
you'll tell me why

34:33.114 --> 34:37.292
you're so calm
about all this.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.993
I am not calm.

34:45.257 --> 34:47.259
I'm scared.

34:50.131 --> 34:52.090
I'm scared every minute.

34:52.133 --> 34:55.919
It takes everything I have
not to show it to them.

34:55.963 --> 34:58.183
I cannot give them
the satisfaction

34:58.226 --> 35:00.228
of knowing
they're getting to me.

35:04.580 --> 35:07.105
It was worse when I was alone.

35:09.455 --> 35:11.370
But yet you endured.

35:11.413 --> 35:13.763
I have a mantra.

35:17.027 --> 35:19.813
"They will not break me."

35:19.856 --> 35:23.556
[quietly]:
"They will not break me."

35:25.775 --> 35:29.866
They will not... break me.

35:32.304 --> 35:33.740
That's it, brother.

35:35.742 --> 35:37.352
You got this.

35:42.836 --> 35:44.838
[door opens]

35:47.754 --> 35:49.843
Sit down. Sit down.

36:04.205 --> 36:06.164
[tape tearing in distance]

36:11.299 --> 36:13.171
War is hell, man.

36:21.875 --> 36:24.878
Bravo 4, this is 6.

36:24.921 --> 36:26.836
Can Metal and Brock
hold security without you?

36:26.880 --> 36:28.011
TRENT:
Affirm.

36:28.055 --> 36:30.666
Great. Come meet me here

36:30.710 --> 36:31.667
at the DCP.

36:31.711 --> 36:33.016
Copy that. Moving.

36:36.063 --> 36:37.717
[static crackling]

36:45.899 --> 36:47.335
What do you guys need?

36:47.379 --> 36:48.902
You and Thirty
hold security here.

36:49.903 --> 36:51.034
Come on. Let's talk.

36:51.078 --> 36:52.906
Let's go.

36:56.779 --> 36:59.173
Come here. Come here, sit down.
Sit down for a second.

37:00.566 --> 37:04.265
Mr. Nasri really likes you,
Faraz. You know that?

37:04.309 --> 37:06.441
He wouldn't have given you an
American's watch if he didn't.

37:06.485 --> 37:08.878
So if you know
anything, tell me,

37:08.922 --> 37:11.054
and I can stop them
from what they're doing

37:11.098 --> 37:12.969
to your friend
in the other room.

37:13.013 --> 37:15.798
He is not my friend.
He's a fool.

37:25.547 --> 37:26.940
Did you smell the food,

37:26.983 --> 37:28.333
when we passed the static?[shushes]

37:28.376 --> 37:29.856
Not now.

37:38.734 --> 37:41.171
Let's start here.

37:42.347 --> 37:43.652
You don't like Nasri?

37:45.175 --> 37:46.960
You think he's not
a true Muslim.

37:47.003 --> 37:48.701
He just, he takes money
from your brothers

37:48.744 --> 37:51.138
doing the fighting and mocks
their cause behind their backs?

37:51.181 --> 37:53.227
Yet you're gonna be

37:53.271 --> 37:55.142
one who's enduring
the pain and suffering next

37:55.185 --> 37:57.144
because you're sitting here
protecting him.

37:57.187 --> 37:59.712
It will be an honor
to bleed for my brothers.

38:13.421 --> 38:15.467
Think of your son.

38:16.598 --> 38:18.513
[man speaking Arabic]

38:21.168 --> 38:22.604
JASON:
It's a real simple question...

38:24.824 --> 38:26.521
...when you think about
it. The right answer

38:26.565 --> 38:27.914
will put a stop to all this.

38:30.438 --> 38:31.874
Whatever you do to me,
it won't be as bad

38:31.918 --> 38:34.355
as what happens
if I betray my partners.

38:34.399 --> 38:36.139
Unless you are more like them
than I thought.

38:36.183 --> 38:37.489
[pliers clicking]

38:40.361 --> 38:42.232
Being part of the cause
is important to you, huh?

38:42.276 --> 38:43.451
Supporting your brothers?

38:43.495 --> 38:44.800
But you can't contribute
the way you'd like.

38:44.844 --> 38:46.280
That right?

38:46.324 --> 38:47.629
'Cause Nasri's
holding you back.

38:47.673 --> 38:48.804
I know what it's like
to work for someone

38:48.848 --> 38:50.110
who doesn't listen to me.

38:50.153 --> 38:51.285
How many times
has he overruled you

38:51.329 --> 38:52.330
even though you knew better?

38:52.373 --> 38:53.418
Every day.

38:53.461 --> 38:54.984
It's infuriating.

38:55.028 --> 38:56.464
Being ignored
when you know what's best.

38:59.162 --> 39:01.164
[panting]

39:04.385 --> 39:06.779
No, no...

39:06.822 --> 39:08.607
JASON [straining]:
Hey. Come on. Open them up.

39:08.650 --> 39:09.825
Open them up.

39:09.869 --> 39:11.436
I'm not weak like you.

39:11.479 --> 39:14.264
When Nasri is wrong,
I do what's right.

39:14.308 --> 39:16.963
[thudding in distance]

39:18.921 --> 39:20.706
You know,

39:20.749 --> 39:23.186
I was wrong before.
You're not gonna have
to bleed for your brothers.

39:23.230 --> 39:25.014
We know that Nasri's
the only real player here.

39:25.058 --> 39:27.669
"Player"?Like, the leader, someone
in charge, someone of value.

39:27.713 --> 39:28.844
Not a little clerk like you.

39:28.888 --> 39:29.932
I am a player, too.

39:29.976 --> 39:31.847
Oh, really?
Forging passports?

39:31.891 --> 39:33.501
You get a watch, he gets
the glory from your brothers

39:33.545 --> 39:35.068
for delivering the American.If it wasn't for me,

39:35.111 --> 39:36.591
my brothers wouldn't
have the Americans.

39:36.635 --> 39:39.507
That's right. That's right,
they wouldn't have the American,

39:39.551 --> 39:41.553
because you had
a better idea than Mr. Nasri.

39:43.119 --> 39:44.425
But your heroes?
They're gonna give him

39:44.469 --> 39:46.209
all the credit
because he's the boss.

39:46.253 --> 39:48.037
They're never gonna know
that you're the real ally here,

39:48.081 --> 39:50.388
and they're always just gonna
look at you like you're Nasri's

39:50.431 --> 39:53.129
little errand boy.Nasri wanted to move them
from here yesterday afternoon.

39:53.173 --> 39:56.176
But too many eyes,
so I changed it to El Kantaoui.

39:59.309 --> 40:01.050
I am very good.All Bravo elements,

40:01.094 --> 40:03.009
this is Bravo 6.You will never find them.

40:03.052 --> 40:04.967
Tango on target just informed us
that Bravo 2 was transferred

40:05.011 --> 40:06.534
from El Kantaoui
yesterday afternoon.

40:08.014 --> 40:09.972
I say again,
Bravo 2 was transferred

40:10.016 --> 40:12.018
from El Kantaoui.

40:19.547 --> 40:21.549
[man speaking Arabic]

40:46.531 --> 40:48.533
[panting]

41:00.936 --> 41:02.764
You all right, Jace?

41:10.380 --> 41:12.600
I stopped it in time?Uh, damnedest thing, man.

41:12.644 --> 41:13.906
he walked right up to the line

41:13.949 --> 41:16.038
and stopped himself
from crossing it.

41:16.082 --> 41:18.693
That office in there, well,
it's a little worse for wear.

41:18.737 --> 41:20.173
[chuckles]

41:28.877 --> 41:30.052
JASON:
Hey.

41:30.096 --> 41:32.054
Good work.

41:33.839 --> 41:36.015
Let's go get Ray.

41:52.161 --> 41:54.120
[metallic tapping]

41:54.163 --> 41:56.165
[static crackling]

42:06.959 --> 42:08.961
[wind whistling]
