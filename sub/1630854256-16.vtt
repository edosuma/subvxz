WEBVTT

00:10.040 --> 00:12.280
* *

00:17.410 --> 00:19.300
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:19.500 --> 00:20.930
(barking)

00:21.130 --> 00:23.100
Hey, hey! (groans)

00:23.300 --> 00:25.520
Rebel, come on.

00:26.790 --> 00:28.570
Rebel.

00:28.770 --> 00:31.080
Rebel?

00:31.280 --> 00:32.080
(rustling)

00:32.280 --> 00:33.610
Reb... (sighs)
(whines)

00:33.810 --> 00:35.510
Thanks. It's not really
what I had in mind

00:35.710 --> 00:37.050
for breakfast this morning.

00:37.250 --> 00:39.300
(phone vibrates)

00:47.640 --> 00:49.160
(barking)
No!

00:49.360 --> 00:50.200
Rebel.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.320
Rebel, no.

00:55.450 --> 00:56.340
(gunshot)

00:56.540 --> 00:58.750
(barking)

01:08.560 --> 01:10.970
* *

01:28.580 --> 01:31.670
So, we see this guy from
across the parking lot.

01:31.870 --> 01:34.510
And there's not a lot of
cover for an approach

01:34.710 --> 01:36.340
and we know he's
gonna rabbit.

01:36.540 --> 01:37.240
They always do.

01:37.440 --> 01:38.340
Even though we're still

01:38.540 --> 01:40.150
a football field away...

01:40.350 --> 01:41.610
Okay, it wasn't that far.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.520
Tree yells out,
"Federal agents!"

01:43.720 --> 01:45.150
And guess what happens.

01:45.350 --> 01:46.120
The guy rabbits.

01:46.320 --> 01:48.250
And Tree goes after him.

01:48.450 --> 01:49.620
At least I caught the guy.

01:49.820 --> 01:50.960
Yeah, after, like,
a ten-minute chase.

01:51.160 --> 01:53.460
Okay, and that
is not the point.

01:53.660 --> 01:54.790
She's right.
You're always trying

01:54.990 --> 01:56.260
to show off how fast you are.

01:56.460 --> 01:57.930
Whose side are you on?
No, remember how

01:58.130 --> 01:59.830
you would conveniently forget
to pack my school lunch?

02:00.030 --> 02:02.640
And I'd be on the bus
laughing with my friends,

02:02.840 --> 02:04.970
then suddenly there he is
running alongside,

02:05.170 --> 02:07.370
banging on the door
like Keanu Reeves.
FATIMA: No.

02:07.570 --> 02:08.870
It was
embarrassing.

02:09.070 --> 02:10.810
Okay, first of all, I wasn't
the one who forgot the lunch

02:11.010 --> 02:12.480
in the first place,
that was you.

02:12.680 --> 02:13.610
All right. I'll give you that.

02:13.810 --> 02:14.880
But there was a reason.

02:15.080 --> 02:15.950
Sardine sandwiches?

02:16.150 --> 02:17.080
Yuck.
Avocado

02:17.280 --> 02:18.680
and sprouts? I was 14.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.190
I didn't want to eat that.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.720
I don't want to eat that now.

02:21.920 --> 02:24.090
Uh, okay, first of all,
that's brain food.

02:24.290 --> 02:26.560
All right? And it worked.
Look at you now.

02:26.760 --> 02:29.460
Future doctor right here.
Aced her MCATs.

02:29.660 --> 02:31.860
Yeah,
yeah.

02:32.060 --> 02:33.870
But, uh, I can feed myself
from now on, okay?

02:34.070 --> 02:35.070
(laughing)

02:35.270 --> 02:36.340
So, Summer, you have any, uh,

02:36.540 --> 02:37.800
stories about Treefontaine?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.170
I don't know, I-I've given
him a hard enough time

02:40.370 --> 02:41.440
these last few weeks.

02:41.640 --> 02:42.840
I should probably
give him a break.

02:43.040 --> 02:45.380
Aw, that is
so sweet.
Yeah.

02:45.580 --> 02:46.910
What happened?

02:47.110 --> 02:48.310
Okay, so we're
walking on the beach,

02:48.510 --> 02:49.650
and he's still trying
to win me back,

02:49.850 --> 02:52.100
but I'm not making it easy...
(phone vibrates)

02:55.600 --> 02:58.060
Sorry, I'm gonna have
to finish this one later.

02:58.260 --> 02:59.260
Devin's been saved by the bell.

02:59.460 --> 03:01.190
Ooh.
Thank you, FBI.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.030
And I got to get to class.

03:03.230 --> 03:04.230
Okay.
All right.

03:04.430 --> 03:05.200
See you tonight?
Yeah, definitely.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.770
All right.

03:06.970 --> 03:08.170
Later, bro.

03:08.370 --> 03:09.670
Keep feeding that brain.
Yep.

03:09.870 --> 03:11.120
(laughs)

03:15.660 --> 03:18.010
You were enjoying that.

03:18.210 --> 03:20.010
Hey, this breakfast
was your idea.

03:20.210 --> 03:21.550
Yeah.

03:21.750 --> 03:23.250
Remind me not to have
any more of those.

03:23.450 --> 03:24.920
(laughs)

03:25.120 --> 03:27.520
SHYLA: After that, there
is nothing until 1400.

03:27.720 --> 03:30.490
SECNAV has requested
all operation managers

03:30.690 --> 03:33.130
attend virtual AUKUS
briefing with our British

03:33.330 --> 03:34.630
and Aussie counterparts.

03:34.830 --> 03:36.300
They'll be going over evolving

03:36.500 --> 03:38.910
security concerns
around the deal.

03:43.150 --> 03:45.620
I can attend if
you'd rather not.

03:49.890 --> 03:51.640
Oh, as a reminder, Agent Blye

03:51.840 --> 03:53.250
and Investigator Deeks
are out for the day

03:53.450 --> 03:54.850
visiting Rosa's aunt.

03:55.050 --> 03:58.070
She's still recovering
from her stroke.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.790
In other news, uh,
SIPRnet is down today

04:04.990 --> 04:06.890
for scheduled maintenance.
So you have

04:07.090 --> 04:09.230
Agent Castor's
performance evaluation

04:09.430 --> 04:11.630
coming up this week. And

04:11.830 --> 04:15.270
a radioactive quartet
of pubescent turtles

04:15.470 --> 04:19.720
has just foiled an armed robbery
at Santa Monica Pier.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.750
Your flight to San Fran
is just before 2100.

04:32.950 --> 04:35.020
I'll have a car
pick you up at 1900.

04:35.220 --> 04:36.220
Make it 1930.

04:36.420 --> 04:38.360
I hate waiting at the airport.

04:38.560 --> 04:39.560
It's spring break, Admiral.

04:39.760 --> 04:40.990
You'll be cutting it close.

04:41.190 --> 04:42.600
I'll be fine.

04:42.800 --> 04:45.200
I just don't want you to miss
the chance to see your son.

04:45.400 --> 04:46.970
All right, all right, 1900.

04:47.170 --> 04:50.570
But if I am stuck waiting
with a posse of frat boys,

04:50.770 --> 04:51.970
you will never hear
the end of it.

04:52.170 --> 04:53.870
And I wouldn't want
to hear the end of it.

04:54.070 --> 04:55.310
That sounds like a great story.

04:55.510 --> 04:57.280
You are dismissed.

04:57.480 --> 04:58.940
Oh, and Dahr,

04:59.140 --> 05:00.880
put out a BOLO on those turtles

05:01.080 --> 05:04.520
and their giant rat leader.
We can't have

05:04.720 --> 05:07.420
mutant vigilantes
running around the city.

05:07.620 --> 05:09.810
Right away, sir.

05:10.740 --> 05:12.170
(door opens)

05:14.210 --> 05:17.310
Morning.
Morning.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.300
What's this?

05:21.500 --> 05:24.540
That is what Anna...

05:24.740 --> 05:26.790
we would like you to wear
to the wedding.

05:28.020 --> 05:29.880
You're choosing what I wear?
It's part of

05:30.080 --> 05:32.210
her whole color palette
she's going for.

05:32.410 --> 05:35.060
That we are going for.

05:36.030 --> 05:37.120
And everyone's wearing this?

05:37.320 --> 05:39.220
Just you.

05:39.420 --> 05:40.590
Just me?

05:40.790 --> 05:42.300
Obviously.

05:45.640 --> 05:48.310
Is this your way of asking
me to be your best man?

05:51.510 --> 05:53.500
I didn't think that
I actually had to ask.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.670
I mean, uh,

05:55.870 --> 05:58.170
was there ever any question?

05:58.370 --> 06:01.010
I mean, you've been spending a
lot of time with Castor lately.

06:01.210 --> 06:02.660
No, I haven't.

06:03.490 --> 06:04.410
That's not what he says.

06:04.610 --> 06:08.210
(laughs)
We had drinks once.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.780
He was feeling down because
Miraslava had knocked him out.

06:10.980 --> 06:12.330
He needed a little cheering up.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.520
He said you went to dinner, too.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.090
Bar food.

06:16.290 --> 06:19.360
I don't know. I mean,
this guy worships you, he's...

06:19.560 --> 06:20.660
I think he'll be heartbroken.

06:20.860 --> 06:23.160
He even dresses like you.
No, he does not.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.910
Hey, Callen. Sam.

06:27.250 --> 06:28.320
Hey.

06:29.320 --> 06:31.500
Looking good, Castor.

06:31.700 --> 06:33.720
Thanks, man.

06:37.430 --> 06:39.390
Fine. You want me to ask you,
I'll ask you.

06:42.430 --> 06:44.230
Will you be my best man?

06:45.030 --> 06:46.900
Of course.
Was there ever any question?

06:48.570 --> 06:49.890
But I'm gonna have to check
with Anna, though. I got to

06:50.090 --> 06:51.320
talk to her
about this color palette.

06:51.520 --> 06:52.830
Yeah, I agree.
Otherwise you're gonna end up

06:53.030 --> 06:54.680
looking like
The Incredible Hulk.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.330
Hey, guys.

06:57.530 --> 06:58.260
Shyla, you got a case?

06:58.460 --> 06:59.530
Actually, I was hoping

06:59.730 --> 07:01.220
you could tell me.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.340
We just received

07:08.540 --> 07:09.910
an urgent message over JWICS.

07:10.110 --> 07:11.110
It contains two files.

07:11.310 --> 07:12.780
The first is a
driver's license

07:12.980 --> 07:15.380
for John Jenkins,
the CEO for a software startup.

07:15.580 --> 07:18.580
The second is an ID for
FBI analyst Patrick Hertel.

07:18.780 --> 07:21.520
JWICS is only used to share
top-secret information.

07:21.720 --> 07:22.790
What's so urgent
about these guys?

07:22.990 --> 07:24.090
Well, for one thing,
they were both

07:24.290 --> 07:25.760
found murdered
in L.A. this morning.

07:25.960 --> 07:29.230
A neighbor in Van Nuys heard
a gunshot around 6:30 a.m.

07:29.430 --> 07:31.730
LAPD found Hertel's body
in his backyard.

07:31.930 --> 07:33.700
Half an hour later,
Jenkins was found shot

07:33.900 --> 07:35.100
at a business park.

07:35.300 --> 07:36.840
Any other connection
between them?

07:37.040 --> 07:38.270
None that I can see.
And, technically,

07:38.470 --> 07:40.840
neither of their murders
fall under our jurisdiction.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.080
I'm really not
sure what to do.

07:43.280 --> 07:44.310
What are those numbers there?

07:44.510 --> 07:46.810
Eight, 11, 22.

07:47.010 --> 07:49.380
Could be a date.
August 11th, 2022.

07:49.580 --> 07:51.020
JWICS packets
have markers in them.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.280
It should tell us who sent this.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.050
I know, that's where
it gets even stranger.

07:54.250 --> 07:56.490
The source is a SCIF
on the border of Turkey

07:56.690 --> 07:59.470
and Syria, uh,
in the town of Al-Rai.

08:04.350 --> 08:05.330
You know it?

08:05.530 --> 08:07.880
That was her last
known location.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.840
Yeah, but it doesn't
make any sense.

08:11.040 --> 08:12.740
Who else would send
a cryptic message like this?

08:12.940 --> 08:16.060
Wait, are you talking about who
I think you're talking about?

08:18.760 --> 08:20.800
Hetty.

08:32.270 --> 08:34.560
She wouldn't have used JWICS
if it wasn't important.

08:34.760 --> 08:37.200
If it were important,
she'd have sent us more

08:37.400 --> 08:39.830
than two names and
a random set of numbers.

08:40.030 --> 08:42.770
Now, this reads less like,
uh, an urgent message

08:42.970 --> 08:45.600
and more like
a top-secret butt dial.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.340
It is cryptic.
Even for Hetty.

08:48.540 --> 08:49.680
If it's even from her.

08:49.880 --> 08:52.310
Now, the Marine detachment
in the area

08:52.510 --> 08:54.510
said that the SCIF
this packet was sent from

08:54.710 --> 08:56.080
was shut down months ago.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.520
Maybe she sent it from somewhere
else, altered the logs.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.750
Then why not just
sign her name to it?

09:00.950 --> 09:02.090
JWICS is secure.

09:02.290 --> 09:03.470
Unless it's not.

09:04.470 --> 09:06.360
Look, if Hetty thought the DoD's

09:06.560 --> 09:08.490
top-secret network
was compromised,

09:08.690 --> 09:10.100
it would explain why she gave us
so little to go on.

09:10.300 --> 09:13.920
More likely she just enjoys
being a pain in the ass.

09:15.050 --> 09:17.270
I think it's worth looking
into these two victims,

09:17.470 --> 09:18.890
see if there's anything there.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.710
Well, though I do not approve

09:22.910 --> 09:26.210
of Henrietta's incessant
backseat driving,

09:26.410 --> 09:29.350
I suppose I do owe her thanks
for help in the, uh,

09:29.550 --> 09:32.130
Simon Williams debacle.

09:33.100 --> 09:34.320
Find out what you can.

09:34.520 --> 09:35.490
Thanks, Admiral.

09:35.690 --> 09:36.620
But Agent Callen,

09:36.820 --> 09:38.760
you stay in your lane.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.940
Do not interfere with
the official investigations.

09:44.580 --> 09:46.410
(door opens)

09:47.920 --> 09:49.620
(door closes)

09:50.750 --> 09:52.820
(indistinct radio chatter)

09:54.760 --> 09:56.910
So, do we play
the national security card?

09:57.110 --> 09:59.440
I don't know. That feels
a little dishonest.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.750
Well, it came from JWICS.
It's not exactly a lie.

10:01.950 --> 10:04.450
It's not exactly
the truth, either.

10:04.650 --> 10:06.840
Got to tell them something
to get on scene.

10:08.300 --> 10:10.460
Or you could just
make a run for it,

10:10.660 --> 10:14.090
leap over the tape.
I bet you'd look awesome.

10:14.290 --> 10:16.260
(indistinct conversation)
Oh.

10:16.460 --> 10:19.430
I don't think we're gonna
need a cover story at all.

10:19.630 --> 10:21.370
Gonna charm my way
into this one.

10:21.570 --> 10:22.470
Summer.

10:22.670 --> 10:24.920
Yeah. One sec.
Sure.

10:25.990 --> 10:27.840
Devin.
What are you doing here?

10:28.040 --> 10:30.710
We have a case that may be
connected to your murder.

10:30.910 --> 10:32.850
Really?
Yeah, his name
is John Jenkins.

10:33.050 --> 10:35.350
He was killed around
the same time as Patrick Hertel.

10:35.550 --> 10:36.750
ROUNTREE:
Yeah, Sam and Callen

10:36.950 --> 10:38.080
are working that scene now.

10:38.280 --> 10:40.140
What's Jenkins' connection
with Hertel?

10:41.670 --> 10:43.120
They're still investigating.
Yeah.

10:43.320 --> 10:46.410
Well, why do you think
the cases are related?

10:47.210 --> 10:51.510
Um, that's a matter of, uh,
national security.

10:55.320 --> 10:56.790
Can you be more specific?

10:57.720 --> 10:58.600
I'm sorry, it's just...

10:58.800 --> 11:00.670
there are sensitive methods

11:00.870 --> 11:02.070
and sources involved.

11:02.270 --> 11:03.680
We'll disclose them to you
as soon as we can,

11:03.880 --> 11:05.680
but right now we can't.

11:05.880 --> 11:07.710
Then I can't
let you onto my scene.

11:07.910 --> 11:09.850
Hertel is one of us.
This is our case.

11:10.050 --> 11:11.850
Until you can provide
me with some evidence

11:12.050 --> 11:13.290
that connects
your vic with ours,

11:13.490 --> 11:15.320
I can't help you.

11:15.520 --> 11:16.820
Summer, wait.
I'm sorry.

11:17.020 --> 11:19.740
Get me something. Anything.

11:22.950 --> 11:24.730
Well played, Prince Charming.

11:24.930 --> 11:26.820
I...
(sighs)

11:32.050 --> 11:33.970
LAPD doesn't have
any eyewitnesses.

11:34.170 --> 11:35.910
None of the businesses were
open at the time of the murder.

11:36.110 --> 11:37.210
Cameras?

11:37.410 --> 11:39.710
All offline due
to routine maintenance.

11:39.910 --> 11:43.450
Well, could be a coincidence.

11:43.650 --> 11:46.480
Yeah, speaking
of, uh, coincidences.

11:46.680 --> 11:47.790
Spoke to Fatima.

11:47.990 --> 11:49.550
Turns out that, uh,
Rountree's girlfriend's

11:49.750 --> 11:51.220
calling the shots
at their scene.

11:51.420 --> 11:52.590
Oh, isn't that a lucky break?

11:52.790 --> 11:54.130
Well, you would think,
but apparently

11:54.330 --> 11:56.460
Rountree's not the smooth-talker
we assumed him to be.

11:56.660 --> 11:58.600
What do you think here?
It's a robbery.

11:58.800 --> 12:01.330
No wallet, no keys, no phone.

12:01.530 --> 12:02.740
No brass, either.

12:02.940 --> 12:05.370
So, either the killer
used a revolver

12:05.570 --> 12:06.600
or they collected it.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.470
Well, I may have found
half of his phone.

12:08.670 --> 12:10.110
Actually, the dog found it.
LAPD

12:10.310 --> 12:12.340
said he had it in his mouth
when they got here.

12:12.540 --> 12:14.350
Reminds me...

12:14.550 --> 12:15.480
(line ringing)

12:15.680 --> 12:16.510
Shyla.

12:16.710 --> 12:17.620
You find any link between

12:17.820 --> 12:18.920
Jenkins and Hertel yet?

12:19.120 --> 12:22.050
Nothing. Not even
a Kevin Bacon connection.

12:22.250 --> 12:23.120
What about 8/11/22?

12:23.320 --> 12:24.660
Maybe they crossed
paths that day?

12:24.860 --> 12:26.120
I'm still checking.
But here's what I do know:

12:26.320 --> 12:29.130
Jenkins' startup has
one employee: Jenkins.

12:29.330 --> 12:31.580
And it hasn't created a product
in five years.

12:32.580 --> 12:34.970
Fake it till you make it. That's
the tech sector's motto, right?

12:35.170 --> 12:36.800
Yeah, but this is going
pretty heavy on the fake.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.440
Except for the money coming in.
That is definitely real.

12:39.640 --> 12:40.470
CALLEN:
So you think it's a front?

12:40.670 --> 12:41.510
You think they're laundering it?

12:41.710 --> 12:43.080
Starting to smell that way.

12:43.280 --> 12:44.180
Do we have any way to get
in touch with his family?

12:44.380 --> 12:45.810
Nope.

12:46.010 --> 12:47.880
He's an orphan and his adoptive
parents died years ago.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.250
CALLEN:
All right. Thanks, Shyla.

12:49.450 --> 12:51.020
All right, so Jenkins
tries to call 911.

12:51.220 --> 12:52.920
The killer takes his
phone and breaks it?

12:53.120 --> 12:55.190
Unless Jenkins
destroyed it himself.

12:55.390 --> 12:56.650
Based on what Shyla
just told us,

12:56.860 --> 12:58.270
he clearly has
some things to hide.

12:59.610 --> 13:00.460
Well...

13:00.660 --> 13:01.490
the dog found this half,

13:01.690 --> 13:02.980
maybe he'll find the other.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.470
(whimpering)

13:07.670 --> 13:10.040
Yeah, no luck so far.

13:10.240 --> 13:11.100
(car door closes)

13:11.300 --> 13:12.960
FATIMA:
Okay...

13:13.960 --> 13:15.540
That's interesting.
(indistinct conversation)

13:15.740 --> 13:17.260
(sighs)

13:19.390 --> 13:20.510
Summer.

13:20.710 --> 13:22.650
FATIMA:
Okay, keep me
updated. Thanks.

13:22.850 --> 13:24.220
(clears throat)

13:24.420 --> 13:25.800
Agent Morehurst.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.210
(clears throat)

13:31.670 --> 13:32.890
Will you stop
yelling at me

13:33.090 --> 13:35.040
from the police tape?
It's embarrassing.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.830
Sorry.
Who are those two people?

13:38.030 --> 13:39.970
Uh, Patrick
Hertel's parents,

13:40.170 --> 13:41.370
so try to be
more respectful.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.170
Oh.

13:43.370 --> 13:44.390
Was he adopted?

13:45.750 --> 13:47.170
I mean, they don't
look anything like him.

13:47.370 --> 13:48.870
Yes, his biological parents
were killed

13:49.070 --> 13:50.260
when he was just a child.

13:51.190 --> 13:52.240
Wait, so he was an orphan?

13:52.440 --> 13:54.280
Yes.
And I really need to get back.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.610
And you two really need to go
before I make you go.

13:56.810 --> 13:57.980
Wait, I just talked to Ops.

13:58.180 --> 14:00.520
Our victim, John Jenkins--
he was an orphan, too.

14:00.720 --> 14:01.690
Okay.

14:01.890 --> 14:02.520
Boom.
There's your evidence.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.190
Circumstantial.

14:04.390 --> 14:06.360
Summer, they both were killed
within an hour of each other

14:06.560 --> 14:07.660
and they're both orphans.

14:07.860 --> 14:08.790
Both shot in the back
of the head

14:08.990 --> 14:10.150
to make it to look like
a robbery.

14:11.050 --> 14:12.330
How'd you know that?

14:12.530 --> 14:14.130
I didn't. It's just what
happened to our victim.

14:14.330 --> 14:15.750
I figured it's what
happened to yours.

14:19.290 --> 14:20.320
Come on.
Yes.

14:21.790 --> 14:23.130
Thank you.

14:23.960 --> 14:26.130
(indistinct chatter)

14:28.400 --> 14:29.920
SAM:
Still haven't set a date, huh?

14:30.120 --> 14:33.240
Nope. Anna's giving me time
to look for Hetty.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.720
Well, maybe this message
is the thing that leads to her.

14:36.920 --> 14:39.420
Eh, I don't think so.

14:39.620 --> 14:41.360
I think Kilbride's right.

14:41.560 --> 14:42.930
If she wanted us to know more,
she would have told us more.

14:43.130 --> 14:44.300
If she wanted to be found,

14:44.500 --> 14:45.530
she would have told us
where to find her.

14:45.730 --> 14:46.870
But she doesn't.

14:47.070 --> 14:48.400
You know, at a certain point,

14:48.600 --> 14:49.900
I can't make Anna
wait any longer.

14:50.100 --> 14:51.370
At a certain point,
I don't want to wait any longer.

14:51.570 --> 14:52.820
I want to marry her.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.440
I can't wait to make
my best man speech.

14:56.640 --> 14:57.740
I have a lot to say.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.880
(chuckles)
A lot of wisdom to impart.

15:00.080 --> 15:01.850
I'm pretty sure
I've heard it all at this point.

15:02.050 --> 15:04.180
Not to you.
For Anna.

15:04.380 --> 15:05.620
Want to make sure

15:05.820 --> 15:06.950
she's really clear about
what she's getting herself into.

15:07.150 --> 15:09.120
Maybe I do want
to talk to Castor.

15:09.320 --> 15:11.840
(Rebel barking)
Okay.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.710
Good boy.

15:19.780 --> 15:21.300
Any progress on
our mystery, Dahr?

15:21.500 --> 15:22.300
Well,

15:22.500 --> 15:23.600
we found a connection.

15:23.800 --> 15:24.970
And it's not
from August 11th, 2022.

15:25.170 --> 15:26.470
It's from the 1980s.

15:26.670 --> 15:28.470
Seems that both Jenkins
and Hertel were orphans

15:28.670 --> 15:30.980
who went through the
Los Angeles foster care system.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.880
Other than that,
they're both in their 40s,

15:33.080 --> 15:34.350
they're both single,
and they both

15:34.550 --> 15:35.910
worked for
the federal government.

15:36.110 --> 15:38.280
What did Jenkins do
for the government?

15:38.480 --> 15:39.780
NSA Analyst.

15:39.980 --> 15:43.060
I only just learned it
from my colleagues back in DC.

15:43.260 --> 15:44.860
This guy doesn't show up
in the employee database,

15:45.060 --> 15:46.120
not even the SAR database.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.930
I was just about
to inform Callen and Sam.

15:49.130 --> 15:53.020
No, hold off. I need you
to pull some files first.

15:54.220 --> 15:55.370
MOREHURST:
<i>It looks like he was</i>

15:55.570 --> 15:57.040
watering his plants
when his killer snuck up

15:57.240 --> 15:59.290
behind him and fired
one shot into his head.

16:00.290 --> 16:01.270
(sighs)

16:01.470 --> 16:02.640
Any cartridges?

16:02.840 --> 16:04.280
None.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.210
Same as Jenkins' scene.

16:06.410 --> 16:07.950
We just word that they
recovered his cell phone.

16:08.150 --> 16:09.650
When you find out
what's on it...

16:09.850 --> 16:10.680
We'll share it.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.780
Thanks.

16:12.980 --> 16:14.250
I'm sorry I stonewalled you.

16:14.450 --> 16:17.140
Don't be. We probably
would have done the same thing.

16:18.670 --> 16:21.330
I just don't understand
how these cases are connected.

16:21.530 --> 16:23.510
(phone vibrates)

16:24.810 --> 16:26.000
Hey, Shyla.

16:26.200 --> 16:28.430
Does Hertel have a birthmark
on his lower back?

16:28.630 --> 16:30.440
Uh, let me check.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.800
Uh, we need to take
a look at his lower back.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.890
Could you lift his shirt for us?

16:39.590 --> 16:41.510
Yeah, he does.

16:41.710 --> 16:42.510
What does that mean?

16:42.710 --> 16:44.270
Call Callen.

16:46.030 --> 16:47.220
Good boy. Thanks again.
(phone vibrates)

16:47.420 --> 16:49.220
Sure thing.
Thank you.
Shyla.

16:49.420 --> 16:50.990
Yeah, we're coming back
with Jenkins' cell phone.

16:51.190 --> 16:52.690
It's broken in half, but
I think it's still salvageable.

16:52.890 --> 16:55.290
KILBRIDE:
It's not a date, Agent Callen.

16:55.490 --> 16:56.360
Admiral?

16:56.560 --> 16:58.660
Eight, 11, 22.
It's not a date.

16:58.860 --> 16:59.660
Those are people.

16:59.860 --> 17:01.330
What do you mean, people?

17:01.530 --> 17:02.730
Jenkins and Hertel

17:02.930 --> 17:06.100
are subjects eight and 22

17:06.300 --> 17:08.940
from the Drona Project.

17:09.140 --> 17:11.560
Your alma mater, Agent Callen.

17:14.730 --> 17:15.650
(stopwatch ticking)

17:15.850 --> 17:17.070
(whimpers)

17:18.600 --> 17:20.140
Finish the job.

17:32.710 --> 17:34.700
Dahr. I just got
off the phone

17:34.900 --> 17:36.700
with the deputy
director of the FBI.

17:36.900 --> 17:40.340
We are now working this case
jointly with Agent Morehurst.

17:40.540 --> 17:42.040
I'll share everything
we have with them.

17:42.240 --> 17:45.410
Maybe leave Henrietta's
involvement out for the moment.

17:45.610 --> 17:47.010
It is just speculation.

17:47.210 --> 17:48.180
Subjects eight

17:48.380 --> 17:49.410
and 22 have been accounted for.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.950
Were you able to ID subject 11?

17:52.150 --> 17:52.950
That would be

17:53.150 --> 17:55.020
Leah Novak.

17:55.220 --> 17:56.290
Former DHS employee

17:56.490 --> 17:59.810
now freelances
as a ransomware negotiator.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.860
How were you able
to ID her so quickly?

18:03.060 --> 18:04.900
I didn't. Callen
found her last year.

18:05.100 --> 18:07.120
He's attempting to make contact
as we speak.

18:09.280 --> 18:10.140
(line ringing)

18:10.340 --> 18:12.090
Come on, come on. Pick up.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.140
LEAH: Hello?
Leah, it's Callen.

18:16.340 --> 18:17.180
I thought
I made it clear I didn't

18:17.380 --> 18:18.210
want to talk to you anymore.

18:18.410 --> 18:19.210
Just listen to me.

18:19.410 --> 18:20.610
Your life is in danger.

18:20.810 --> 18:22.660
Boy, you don't know when
to stop lying, do you?

18:23.430 --> 18:24.920
This is Special
Agent Sam Hanna.

18:25.120 --> 18:25.880
He's not lying.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.290
Two people are already dead.

18:27.490 --> 18:28.390
Both of them from Drona.

18:28.590 --> 18:29.690
Leah, where are you?

18:29.890 --> 18:31.190
I don't know
what you're playing at,

18:31.390 --> 18:33.130
Callen, but stay away from me.

18:33.330 --> 18:35.130
If you call again, I will...
(door closes)

18:35.330 --> 18:36.810
(whispering): Go, go.

18:39.610 --> 18:40.850
CALLEN:
Leah?

18:42.080 --> 18:42.930
Leah?

18:43.130 --> 18:44.100
(gunshots)

18:44.300 --> 18:45.700
Leah? Leah!

18:45.900 --> 18:48.090
(gunfire continuing)

18:49.420 --> 18:50.340
Leah.

18:50.540 --> 18:51.480
Shyla, can you trace her cell?

18:51.680 --> 18:52.880
The line's still open.

18:53.080 --> 18:54.650
Just a moment.
CALLEN: Leah, are you there?

18:54.850 --> 18:56.710
Shyla, did you get it?
Yeah, Mid City parking garage.

18:56.910 --> 18:58.130
You're just a few minutes away.

19:20.150 --> 19:22.370
Over here.

19:22.570 --> 19:23.410
Think she's alive.

19:23.610 --> 19:25.210
Shyla, call an ambulance.

19:25.410 --> 19:26.210
It's already on its way.

19:26.410 --> 19:28.750
She's alive.

19:28.950 --> 19:29.750
(gasps)
It's okay.

19:29.950 --> 19:31.650
It's okay. It's Callen.

19:31.850 --> 19:33.150
(sirens wailing in distance)

19:33.350 --> 19:35.100
Fourteen...

19:39.010 --> 19:40.530
Wh...

19:40.730 --> 19:42.510
Leah.

19:52.650 --> 19:54.040
Hey, how's Leah?

19:54.240 --> 19:56.410
She's in serious condition
and undergoing surgery.

19:56.610 --> 19:57.780
Protection detail?

19:57.980 --> 19:59.580
Agent Castor's watching her.

19:59.780 --> 20:00.880
What about Callen?

20:01.080 --> 20:02.450
Shouldn't he have
protection detail?

20:02.650 --> 20:05.120
I mean, clearly someone's
targeting Drona subjects.

20:05.320 --> 20:08.420
Yeah, but if Callen
was actually in danger,

20:08.620 --> 20:10.960
I mean, Hetty would have said
that in her message to him.

20:11.160 --> 20:12.920
Right?
KILBRIDE: Do not attempt

20:13.120 --> 20:15.330
to divine
Henrietta's intentions.

20:15.530 --> 20:16.690
That way lies madness.

20:16.890 --> 20:19.500
I do have something
else for you.

20:19.700 --> 20:21.900
Another Drona subject
may be in danger.

20:22.100 --> 20:24.470
Number 14.
Find out who that is.

20:24.670 --> 20:26.300
And Dahr, cancel my
flight this evening.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.690
I think I'll
be needed here.

20:29.760 --> 20:30.740
I'll send the file
to the gadget room.

20:30.940 --> 20:32.310
Why the gadget room?

20:32.510 --> 20:33.550
Callen and Sam

20:33.750 --> 20:34.780
retrieved Jenkins'
broken phone.

20:34.980 --> 20:35.710
It's possible that
he disposed of it

20:35.910 --> 20:36.780
before he was killed.

20:36.980 --> 20:38.220
Finding out why could help.

20:38.420 --> 20:40.570
You got it.

20:43.670 --> 20:44.920
SAM:
<i>By my count, there were</i>

20:45.120 --> 20:46.820
three shooters.
Leah hit two of them.

20:47.020 --> 20:48.060
Which is explains why
they probably

20:48.260 --> 20:49.360
left their brass there
this time.

20:49.560 --> 20:50.500
They needed to retreat.

20:50.700 --> 20:53.230
She had a go bag in her car.

20:53.430 --> 20:55.470
Water, MREs, burners, sat phone.

20:55.670 --> 20:56.800
She knew she was in danger.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.400
Maybe Jenkins did, too.

20:58.600 --> 20:59.940
That's why he tossed his phone.

21:00.140 --> 21:02.940
Well, it would explain
all the cash she had on her.

21:03.140 --> 21:04.540
Must have stashed it
in case of an emergency.

21:04.740 --> 21:05.910
That's what I'd do.

21:06.110 --> 21:08.250
Yeah, and you might want
to rethink your methods.

21:08.450 --> 21:10.260
Stopping for the cash
almost got her killed.

21:11.970 --> 21:13.950
He'll be coming for me next.

21:14.150 --> 21:15.350
Who?

21:15.550 --> 21:16.840
Pembrook.

21:18.770 --> 21:22.840
So, what can
I help you with today?

21:23.650 --> 21:25.460
Has to be him.

21:25.660 --> 21:26.730
After I found him last year,

21:26.930 --> 21:27.730
he's wiping clear
any trace of Drona,

21:27.930 --> 21:29.270
covering his tracks.

21:29.470 --> 21:31.870
That doesn't explain why Leah
knew she was in trouble.

21:32.070 --> 21:33.100
You said she didn't
remember Pembrook.

21:33.300 --> 21:34.940
So she says.
She clearly knows

21:35.140 --> 21:36.920
a lot more
than she's letting on.

21:38.760 --> 21:41.260
I need to find Pembrook.

21:43.630 --> 21:45.080
ROUNTREE:
Don't worry.

21:45.280 --> 21:46.350
We'll make our dinner.

21:46.550 --> 21:48.620
And if we don't make
dinner, I'll make dinner.

21:48.820 --> 21:49.720
(chuckles)

21:49.920 --> 21:51.090
No, no. (scoffs)

21:51.290 --> 21:52.260
Sardine sandwiches?

21:52.460 --> 21:54.660
Those are strictly for Jordyn.

21:54.860 --> 21:57.180
Oh, whatever,
I'm a great brother.

22:00.380 --> 22:01.670
Hey, we're in.

22:01.870 --> 22:03.400
Hey, Summer,
we're in Jenkins' phone.

22:03.600 --> 22:04.540
I'll call you back.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.190
Okay. Bye.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.070
Okay, not a lot on here.

22:09.270 --> 22:11.990
There is a recent text
from an unlisted number.

22:12.860 --> 22:14.650
Says "Dhrishtadyumna."

22:14.850 --> 22:17.010
Okay, I'll take
your word for it.

22:17.210 --> 22:19.180
What is that?
Who is that.

22:19.380 --> 22:22.290
A Hindu warrior
from the <i>Mahabharata</i>

22:22.490 --> 22:24.060
who beheaded Drona.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.390
(scoffs) Wow, yeah,
I'd say that's code word

22:26.590 --> 22:27.930
for "you're in trouble."

22:28.130 --> 22:30.090
Looks like Jenkins had a few
other numbers in here.

22:30.290 --> 22:32.400
One is for Leah,
another for Hertel,

22:32.600 --> 22:35.820
another one for someone
named Anthony Beltran.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.500
Let's see, it looks like
he's a history professor

22:39.700 --> 22:40.970
and a former Army Ranger.

22:41.170 --> 22:43.580
Check out his
birthdate.

22:43.780 --> 22:44.810
It's the same as subject 14.

22:45.010 --> 22:47.430
I'll send his address
to Sam and Callen.

22:56.640 --> 22:57.940
Anthony Beltran?

22:59.610 --> 23:00.860
Hey, stop.
Go, go.

23:01.060 --> 23:03.040
I'll cut him off.
We're federal agents!

23:03.810 --> 23:06.710
Anthony, stop!
We're here to help!

23:12.020 --> 23:14.460
Anthony, we're not
here to hurt you.

23:15.860 --> 23:17.860
Leah sent us.

23:18.790 --> 23:19.740
She's alive?

23:19.940 --> 23:21.680
She's safe.

23:21.880 --> 23:24.170
(car approaching)

23:26.370 --> 23:27.490
Put the gun down.

23:27.690 --> 23:28.490
(car door opens)

23:28.690 --> 23:31.040
Put your
weapon down.

23:35.780 --> 23:37.040
Who are you?

23:38.850 --> 23:41.020
NCIS Special Agent
Grisha Callen.

23:43.820 --> 23:46.140
I'm subject 17.

23:46.340 --> 23:47.990
You're safe.

24:05.440 --> 24:08.330
SAM:
Burners, cash, MREs.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.430
It's a go bag.
Just like Leah's.

24:10.630 --> 24:11.860
Except it doesn't
have a cell phone.

24:12.060 --> 24:13.300
He said he got the same
message as Jenkins.

24:13.500 --> 24:14.730
Dhrishtadyumna.

24:14.930 --> 24:16.820
Yeah, that one.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.940
Why were all the Drona subjects
in contact with each another?

24:20.140 --> 24:21.310
Who warned them?

24:21.510 --> 24:23.530
Could be the same person
that tipped us off.

24:24.930 --> 24:26.610
Never makes anything
easy, does she?

24:26.810 --> 24:28.280
That's how she creates
effective operatives.

24:28.480 --> 24:29.950
Okay, well, we're not
in training anymore.

24:30.150 --> 24:31.280
People are dying.

24:31.480 --> 24:32.380
I'm just saying Hetty
usually has a reason

24:32.580 --> 24:34.820
for the way
she does things.

24:35.020 --> 24:35.850
Hey, good news.

24:36.050 --> 24:37.190
With help from Agent Morehurst,

24:37.390 --> 24:38.460
we were able
to identify a vehicle

24:38.660 --> 24:39.890
from all three crime scenes

24:40.090 --> 24:41.690
and use Kaleidoscope
to backtrack it

24:41.890 --> 24:43.530
to a building downtown.
All right,
good work.

24:43.730 --> 24:44.960
Tell Fatima and Rountree
I'll meet them there.

24:45.160 --> 24:46.330
And tell them to tac up.

24:46.530 --> 24:47.360
You got it.
You don't want me with you?

24:47.570 --> 24:48.370
Of course.

24:48.570 --> 24:49.730
But we need some answers.

24:49.930 --> 24:52.390
And that guy in there?
He's got them.

24:55.520 --> 24:56.790
(door opens)

25:04.530 --> 25:06.650
Have a seat.

25:06.850 --> 25:08.400
I'm good.

25:17.210 --> 25:20.230
Where were you between 6:00
and 7:00 a.m. this morning?

25:20.430 --> 25:21.430
(scoffs) Home.

25:21.630 --> 25:23.200
Anyone that can
vouch for you?

25:23.400 --> 25:25.200
I live alone.

25:25.400 --> 25:26.400
This text you said
you received--

25:26.600 --> 25:27.970
who'd it come from?

25:28.170 --> 25:29.410
I don't know.

25:29.610 --> 25:30.810
I was busy all morning
with a lesson plan

25:31.010 --> 25:33.280
so I didn't see it
till a couple hours ago.

25:33.480 --> 25:35.000
But I knew what
it meant right away.

25:36.030 --> 25:39.020
I teach ancient history,
I've read the <i>Mahabharata.</i>

25:39.220 --> 25:42.070
I called Leah, she told me
about John and Patrick.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.660
Put my phone down
the garbage disposal,

25:44.860 --> 25:48.060
grabbed my bag, that's when
you drove up on me.

25:48.260 --> 25:52.550
I thought you were his guys,
working for him.

25:53.510 --> 25:54.750
Who?

25:56.180 --> 25:57.870
Who do you think?

25:58.070 --> 25:59.550
Howard Pembrook.

26:07.460 --> 26:09.180
You remember Pembrook?

26:09.380 --> 26:10.560
(chuckles)

26:12.170 --> 26:14.920
How could I forget?

26:15.120 --> 26:16.970
That guy left scars.

26:19.070 --> 26:21.710
Some you can see.

26:27.620 --> 26:29.180
And some you can't.

26:31.490 --> 26:32.900
And why is he targeting you?

26:33.100 --> 26:36.760
Because we finally decided
to do something about him.

26:38.230 --> 26:41.010
We were sharing
information, stories,

26:41.210 --> 26:43.550
planning how we could build
a legal case against him.

26:43.750 --> 26:46.780
Get justice
for what he did to us.

26:46.980 --> 26:49.450
It was Leah's idea.
She brought us all together.

26:49.650 --> 26:51.360
When was this?
A year ago.

26:51.560 --> 26:55.140
After you talked to her
about him.

26:56.780 --> 26:58.060
She told us about you,

26:58.260 --> 26:59.760
but I didn't know
what you looked like.

26:59.960 --> 27:03.120
And-and we didn't
include you because...

27:04.290 --> 27:07.790
...well, you lied to her.

27:09.120 --> 27:12.410
We kept what we
were doing quiet.

27:12.610 --> 27:15.210
At least we thought we did.

27:15.410 --> 27:16.480
Somehow Pembrook found out

27:16.680 --> 27:18.670
and now he's trying
to silence us.

27:22.740 --> 27:24.670
Is Leah okay?

27:26.270 --> 27:27.910
She was shot multiple times.

27:31.410 --> 27:33.180
Could I see her?

27:35.620 --> 27:37.030
It's too dangerous.
Please.

27:37.230 --> 27:40.910
Please, Agent Callen.

27:41.110 --> 27:42.620
Leah and me...

27:44.460 --> 27:46.990
...we became very close.

27:53.230 --> 27:55.120
Summer and her team
are 30 minutes out.

27:55.320 --> 27:56.520
Are we waiting for them?

27:56.720 --> 27:57.590
According to Shyla,
the shooters' vehicle

27:57.790 --> 27:58.790
hasn't returned yet.

27:58.990 --> 27:59.820
So, now may be
our best chance

28:00.020 --> 28:01.490
to scope it out.
I agree.

28:01.690 --> 28:04.250
But that doesn't mean this place
is empty, so be on the alert.

28:07.510 --> 28:08.400
On three.

28:08.600 --> 28:10.750
One, two...

28:20.230 --> 28:22.230
* *

28:30.370 --> 28:31.520
Clear.
Clear.

28:31.720 --> 28:34.090
All right, let's get
as much intel as we can

28:34.290 --> 28:35.830
and secure this place
until the FBI arrives.

28:36.030 --> 28:38.110
All right, I'll try
to access the server.

28:40.780 --> 28:42.200
Looks like
it's password protected.

28:42.400 --> 28:43.370
Can you crack it?

28:43.570 --> 28:44.540
With a little help from Shyla.

28:44.740 --> 28:46.600
ROUNTREE:
Yo, Sam.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.220
Check this out.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.820
CALLEN:
That was taken
in Pembrook's garden.

29:04.020 --> 29:05.590
After I confirmed
who he was, I went back

29:05.790 --> 29:07.670
to confront him, but he'd
already cleared out.

29:08.740 --> 29:10.030
So this building
your team found--

29:10.230 --> 29:11.360
Pembrook's been
working out of there?

29:11.560 --> 29:12.630
It looks like it.

29:12.830 --> 29:14.320
But he hasn't
been working alone.

29:15.650 --> 29:16.900
This all started with you.

29:17.100 --> 29:19.300
After you found him,
he knew his cover was blown.

29:19.500 --> 29:20.740
He figured his subjects
would be coming for him.

29:20.940 --> 29:22.470
So he started
to track them down

29:22.670 --> 29:24.030
to eliminate the threat.

29:24.930 --> 29:27.510
But then why didn't
he come for me?

29:27.710 --> 29:29.080
I found him.
I was the primary threat.

29:29.280 --> 29:31.920
We were the ones who were trying
to build a case against him.

29:32.120 --> 29:33.970
Maybe he saw that
as a greater threat.

29:35.770 --> 29:39.640
Hey. Doctor says you can
go in and see her now.

29:53.590 --> 29:55.360
Oh...

30:00.290 --> 30:03.930
I know it looks bad,
but the doctors are optimistic.

30:06.470 --> 30:08.800
Pembrook needs to pay.

30:19.010 --> 30:22.370
All right, I'm in.
Thanks, Shyla.

30:22.570 --> 30:24.470
SHYLA: Anytime.
FATIMA:
All right, once I connect

30:24.670 --> 30:26.770
the transmitter, I'll be able
to upload to Ops.

30:26.970 --> 30:28.190
Copy that.

30:29.690 --> 30:31.140
Whoa.
SAM: What is it?

30:31.340 --> 30:34.180
Looks like these files were open
from the previous session.

30:34.380 --> 30:36.380
They look like
black ops missions.

30:36.580 --> 30:37.980
Look, this one's for Crimea,

30:38.180 --> 30:40.940
another for Somalia,
one for Brazil.

30:41.740 --> 30:43.620
So Pembrook's not
just a gardener.

30:43.820 --> 30:45.160
He's still in the game.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.440
(typing)

30:48.780 --> 30:50.490
And his latest mission:
taking them out.

30:50.690 --> 30:52.600
There's an audio file.

30:52.800 --> 30:54.700
LEAH:
I see the target. Not clear.

30:54.900 --> 30:56.830
Eight, I need a visual
on the northwest corner.

30:57.030 --> 30:58.600
JENKINS:
Copy that, 11. Not clear.

30:58.800 --> 30:59.700
LEAH:
Command, what should we do?

30:59.900 --> 31:01.740
That's Leah talking to Jenkins.

31:01.940 --> 31:03.140
They're using
their Drona numbers.

31:03.340 --> 31:05.840
Yeah, it sounds like
they're on a mission.

31:06.040 --> 31:07.540
LEAH:
Copy that, Command.

31:07.740 --> 31:08.980
We are go. 14, you have control.

31:09.180 --> 31:10.920
BELTRAN:
Copy that, 11. Target is marked.

31:11.120 --> 31:13.280
In three, two, one, execute.

31:13.480 --> 31:14.690
(gunshot)

31:14.890 --> 31:16.320
Fourteen.

31:16.520 --> 31:19.090
These Drona subjects aren't
being targeted by Pembrook.

31:19.290 --> 31:21.030
They're working for Pembrook.

31:21.230 --> 31:22.790
Beltran's been lying.

31:22.990 --> 31:25.600
Shyla, put me through to Callen.

31:25.800 --> 31:26.600
(static)

31:26.800 --> 31:28.630
Shyla.

31:28.830 --> 31:30.370
Cell service is out, too.

31:30.570 --> 31:32.150
Signal jammers.

31:33.090 --> 31:34.890
Take cover!
(gunfire)

32:10.220 --> 32:11.830
Come to me! come to me!

32:13.730 --> 32:15.910
Come to me, come to me!

32:16.110 --> 32:18.100
(gunfire continuing)

32:19.270 --> 32:20.350
We just got to
hold them off

32:20.550 --> 32:21.920
until Summer and
her team gets here.

32:22.120 --> 32:25.440
Yeah, but when they do, they
might be walking into an ambush.

32:30.310 --> 32:34.900
(phone vibrates)

32:35.100 --> 32:36.000
Go ahead, Shyla.

32:36.200 --> 32:37.230
I lost comms with the team.

32:37.430 --> 32:38.900
Something's jamming the signal.

32:39.100 --> 32:40.200
How far away is the FBI?

32:40.400 --> 32:42.440
I don't know.
I can't reach them either.

32:42.640 --> 32:44.610
All right, I'm on my way.
Trouble?

32:44.810 --> 32:46.780
Yeah. Castor will take you
back to the boatshed.

32:46.980 --> 32:48.010
I'd like to
stay with Leah.

32:48.210 --> 32:49.910
This is still an active threat.

32:50.110 --> 32:51.280
I can help protect her.

32:51.480 --> 32:52.650
It's not safe for you.

32:52.850 --> 32:55.400
I am not worried about myself.

32:57.540 --> 33:00.360
No...

33:00.560 --> 33:02.110
No, you're not.

33:03.110 --> 33:04.510
What?

33:05.550 --> 33:07.970
We received a message
this morning.

33:08.170 --> 33:11.140
It listed the three subjects
that were targets.

33:11.340 --> 33:14.040
Eight, 11 and 22.

33:14.240 --> 33:15.910
Who sent the message?

33:16.110 --> 33:18.640
We think the same person
that warned all of you.

33:18.840 --> 33:19.940
But if they warned you,

33:20.140 --> 33:22.130
why wasn't your number
on our list?

33:23.560 --> 33:25.570
Unless you were never warned.

33:29.540 --> 33:31.790
I got an idea.
I thought you said you weren't
gonna have any more of those.

33:31.990 --> 33:33.290
ROUNTREE:
I'll make a break for it,

33:33.490 --> 33:34.430
draw their fire
away from you guys.

33:34.630 --> 33:35.960
Oh, so you mean
you're gonna run?

33:36.160 --> 33:37.430
Look, I'm not
gonna show off.

33:37.630 --> 33:39.260
I'm just gonna
create a diversion.

33:39.460 --> 33:41.230
Tree, there's nowhere to go.

33:41.430 --> 33:42.530
You'll get
yourself killed.

33:42.730 --> 33:44.050
Nobody's getting killed.

33:46.150 --> 33:47.950
(gunfire continuing)

33:48.860 --> 33:49.760
Tree.

33:53.430 --> 33:55.660
Step away from her.

33:57.300 --> 33:58.450
Callen, this is crazy.

33:58.650 --> 34:01.050
I told you, I got a text.

34:01.250 --> 34:02.320
Dhrishtadyumna.

34:02.520 --> 34:05.060
The warrior who beheaded Drona.

34:05.260 --> 34:07.120
Except he was also

34:07.320 --> 34:10.260
a student of Drona.

34:10.460 --> 34:12.080
A subject.

34:19.150 --> 34:21.810
When Leah said 14,

34:22.010 --> 34:24.640
she wasn't telling me
you were in trouble.

34:24.840 --> 34:27.230
She was telling me
who tried to kill her.

34:28.260 --> 34:29.860
(short chuckle)

34:31.330 --> 34:32.680
Pembrook said you were good.

34:32.880 --> 34:35.570
(door opens)
Castor, take him into custody.

34:36.670 --> 34:37.970
(gun cocks)

34:42.010 --> 34:43.780
I'm good, too.

34:48.180 --> 34:50.020
Go, go, go!

34:55.020 --> 34:56.490
(grunting)

35:03.930 --> 35:05.080
MOREHURST:
FBI! We're coming in.

35:05.280 --> 35:06.250
ROUNTREE:
Summer!

35:06.450 --> 35:07.280
You good?

35:07.480 --> 35:08.620
Yeah, we're good.
Okay.

35:08.820 --> 35:10.320
Clear the weapons.
Copy that.

35:10.520 --> 35:11.910
It's good to see you.

35:12.870 --> 35:14.560
FATIMA:
I recognize him.

35:14.760 --> 35:15.760
He's in Pembrook's files.

35:15.960 --> 35:19.060
He's a Drona subject.

35:19.260 --> 35:20.330
All right, we should
have signal now.

35:20.530 --> 35:22.670
Shyla, put me through to Callen.

35:22.870 --> 35:25.570
Agent Castor
is fine.

35:25.770 --> 35:26.940
He's just taking a nap.

35:27.140 --> 35:28.920
(phone vibrates)

35:30.590 --> 35:32.090
I don't kill people
who don't deserve it.

35:38.100 --> 35:40.670
But you'll murder Leah
when she's laying in a bed?

35:42.240 --> 35:43.350
You're right.

35:43.550 --> 35:45.360
She's no longer a threat,

35:45.560 --> 35:47.170
but I had to make sure.

35:48.440 --> 35:50.030
Why are you doing this?

35:50.230 --> 35:52.130
I know it may not feel like it,
but you and I

35:52.330 --> 35:53.600
are on the same side.

35:53.800 --> 35:55.970
We both want the same thing:

35:56.170 --> 35:58.440
to kill Pembrook.

35:58.640 --> 36:01.340
To cut the head off of Drona.

36:01.540 --> 36:04.020
He is still a monster, 17.

36:04.860 --> 36:06.380
I'm just trying
to do what's right.

36:06.580 --> 36:08.510
It's just a sedative.

36:08.710 --> 36:10.130
I can't have you following us.

36:11.700 --> 36:13.870
(grunting)

36:20.810 --> 36:21.860
Out of the way.

36:22.060 --> 36:23.430
Beltran!

36:23.630 --> 36:25.180
Stop!

36:26.450 --> 36:27.560
(slamming)

36:27.760 --> 36:30.250
BELTRAN:
<i>He is still a monster, 17.</i>

36:31.720 --> 36:33.250
Stop...

36:35.660 --> 36:37.160
PEMBROOK:
<i>Don't cry.</i>

36:38.160 --> 36:38.810
Crying...

36:39.010 --> 36:41.230
<i>causes pain...</i>

36:43.830 --> 36:45.120
<i>...Seventeen.</i>

36:45.320 --> 36:46.480
Need some help here!

36:46.680 --> 36:49.020
* *

36:49.220 --> 36:50.420
SHYLA:
<i>The good news is</i>

36:50.620 --> 36:52.490
Agents Callen and
Castor are okay.

36:52.690 --> 36:53.660
Doctors checked
them out,

36:53.860 --> 36:54.690
and it was just
a sedative.

36:54.890 --> 36:56.260
Good, good.
Bad news is

36:56.460 --> 36:58.760
Beltran and another
Drona subject got away.

36:58.960 --> 37:01.380
But we're working with
the FBI to track them.

37:02.420 --> 37:03.400
Thank you, Dahr.

37:03.600 --> 37:05.570
Oh, uh, your ride to the airport

37:05.770 --> 37:06.990
just pulled up outside.

37:10.460 --> 37:12.780
I thought I told you
to cancel that flight.

37:12.980 --> 37:16.000
Did you?
Oh, I-I don't remember.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.850
You remember everything.
That's why I hired you.

37:21.050 --> 37:22.850
Do you still want me
to cancel it?

37:23.050 --> 37:25.290
Bear in mind,
it is nonrefundable,

37:25.490 --> 37:27.390
and I know how much
you hate wasting money,

37:27.590 --> 37:29.560
not to mention missing
an opportunity to see your son

37:29.760 --> 37:32.410
after all these years...
All right, all right,
I'm leaving.

37:33.580 --> 37:35.380
(sighs)

37:37.380 --> 37:39.270
Remind me to fire you
when I get back.

37:39.470 --> 37:40.670
It's in the lockbox.
Mm.

37:40.870 --> 37:42.510
Have a nice flight, sir.

37:42.710 --> 37:43.960
Say hi to the frat boys.

37:45.990 --> 37:47.940
(mocking chuckle)

37:48.140 --> 37:49.800
(sighs)

37:55.700 --> 37:58.560
All right, vests are done.

37:58.760 --> 38:01.780
Just the guns and
we're out of here.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.500
So what happened
on the beach?

38:04.700 --> 38:05.960
The beach?

38:06.160 --> 38:07.630
You know, the story that Summer

38:07.830 --> 38:09.100
didn't get a chance to finish.

38:09.300 --> 38:11.600
She said you were walking
on the beach and...

38:11.800 --> 38:13.440
Ugh, really?

38:13.640 --> 38:15.010
Come on.
Look, either you can tell it

38:15.210 --> 38:16.640
or she can tell it, okay?

38:16.840 --> 38:18.680
Who do you want to
control the narrative?
Okay, okay.

38:18.880 --> 38:21.010
One day, we're just
walking on the beach,

38:21.210 --> 38:24.250
and the wind
kicks up like crazy.

38:24.450 --> 38:27.120
Sends Summer's hat
flying like a bullet.

38:27.320 --> 38:30.590
I take off after it,
I'm chasing this hat,

38:30.790 --> 38:32.420
and while I'm chasing it,

38:32.620 --> 38:34.390
I kinda sorta maybe

38:34.590 --> 38:36.360
destroyed this kid's sandcastle.

38:36.560 --> 38:37.730
No.
Mm-hmm.

38:37.930 --> 38:40.230
(chuckles)
Yeah, but I got the hat back.

38:40.430 --> 38:41.670
And I spent the next hour

38:41.870 --> 38:44.170
helping the kid
rebuild his sandcastle.

38:44.370 --> 38:45.800
Wow.
(chuckles)

38:46.000 --> 38:49.210
You must really like Summer.

38:49.410 --> 38:50.210
More than anything.

38:50.410 --> 38:52.840
(chuckles)
Yeah, I do.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.900
More than Olaf.

38:55.700 --> 38:56.650
Ex-boyfriend?

38:56.850 --> 38:59.280
What? No. Olaf, the...

38:59.480 --> 39:00.250
Wait, y...

39:00.450 --> 39:02.020
Never mind.

39:02.220 --> 39:03.690
Oh, shoot, I'm gonna
be late for dinner.

39:03.890 --> 39:06.060
Go. Go, go. I'll finish up.
You sure?

39:06.260 --> 39:07.690
Tree. Run.

39:07.890 --> 39:10.810
All right, see you tomorrow.

39:20.290 --> 39:23.070
SAM:
You want to talk about it?

39:23.270 --> 39:25.390
(sighs)
I had him, Sam.

39:26.660 --> 39:29.430
I had him, and then...

39:30.860 --> 39:33.050
Worst part is, I think...

39:33.250 --> 39:35.140
I wanted him to get away.

39:36.600 --> 39:39.890
Think part of me wanted him
to kill Pembrook and...

39:40.090 --> 39:43.840
now, if he does, if he kills
anyone, that's all on me.

39:46.580 --> 39:48.630
Well, I guess we better
find 'em first.

39:48.830 --> 39:50.800
Beltran and Pembrook.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.240
I just wanted to be done
with this.

39:52.440 --> 39:54.890
I just wanted to put this
behind me and move on.

39:55.890 --> 39:56.910
The universe had other plans.

39:57.110 --> 40:00.890
(scoffs)
Hetty had other plans.

40:03.060 --> 40:04.250
I still don't know how
she knew those subjects

40:04.450 --> 40:05.450
were being targeted.

40:05.650 --> 40:07.420
Add it to the list.

40:07.620 --> 40:10.070
(short chuckle)

40:10.970 --> 40:12.370
How's Castor doing?

40:13.510 --> 40:14.560
He's a little down again.

40:14.760 --> 40:16.580
I told him
I'd meet him for a drink.

40:17.710 --> 40:20.830
It's his second time getting
disarmed in three months.

40:21.030 --> 40:22.400
Well, it wasn't exactly
his fault.

40:22.600 --> 40:25.600
Sure. Just don't trust him
with the wedding ring.

40:25.800 --> 40:26.800
Okay, now that's just mean.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.940
You know I'm right.

40:29.140 --> 40:31.440
W... E-Easy, best man.

40:31.640 --> 40:32.740
You already got the job.

40:32.940 --> 40:34.960
Oh, okay, okay.

40:35.730 --> 40:37.480
(laughing)

40:37.680 --> 40:38.750
Mm-hmm.
