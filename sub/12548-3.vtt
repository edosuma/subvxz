WEBVTT

00:00.131 --> 00:02.091
_

00:02.403 --> 00:03.818
Our own people
tried to sink us?

00:03.935 --> 00:05.589
What do you think happens
when you ignore orders?

00:05.745 --> 00:07.575
We didn't ignore anything.
We questioned.

00:07.680 --> 00:10.338
Old Navy saying--
"Stupid will be punished."

00:10.457 --> 00:11.571
(Chaplin) We have commandeered
the NATO

00:11.685 --> 00:13.979
early warning station
on the island of Sainte Marina.

00:14.101 --> 00:16.204
This station,
and that sub parked outside--

00:16.312 --> 00:18.084
they all belong to me now.

00:18.197 --> 00:20.063
We're reading some
20 other warships closing in

00:20.170 --> 00:21.388
on the 200 mile line.

00:21.487 --> 00:23.342
Most should arrive
within the next 48 hours.

00:23.433 --> 00:25.897
Admiral Shepard, we both know
the Pakistanis didn't sink her.

00:26.045 --> 00:28.549
- Dad, it's me.
- I thought I'd lost you.

00:30.685 --> 00:32.232
What the hell did you just do?

00:32.359 --> 00:33.574
You think I made the peace,
Tani?

00:33.652 --> 00:34.885
I just ran out of
people to kill.

00:34.991 --> 00:35.944
This is my island.

00:36.059 --> 00:37.042
If I allow your presence,

00:37.177 --> 00:38.909
it comes with certain
terms and conditions.

00:39.016 --> 00:40.937
Cortez and Brannan are still
missing and assumed AWOL.

00:41.045 --> 00:42.919
Cortez is third tour.
She's not AWOL.

00:43.047 --> 00:44.068
We gotta start looking for 'em.

00:44.166 --> 00:45.255
Marcus, tell them

00:45.358 --> 00:47.168
that your son got killed
by friendly fire

00:47.269 --> 00:49.099
two weeks ago in Afghanistan.

00:49.211 --> 00:50.943
What hurts us the most--
that's our strength.

00:51.043 --> 00:52.320
That's what gets us through.

00:53.621 --> 00:56.095
Sync and corrections by n17t01

00:56.239 --> 00:58.930
(rapid footsteps,
people shouting indistinctly)

01:04.413 --> 01:05.218
(Gunshots)

01:06.194 --> 01:07.350
(Screaming) Back away!

01:07.470 --> 01:10.128
Hey, got off!
Back away! Back away!

01:10.234 --> 01:11.169
- He stole from us!
- What?!

01:11.294 --> 01:13.415
- Right there-- he stole from us!
- Who stole from you? Parker!

01:13.518 --> 01:15.475
- It was a banana, for God sake!
- You stole from these people?!

01:15.663 --> 01:18.125
- It was a banana.
- Give him a dollar, right now.

01:19.187 --> 01:21.876
This will not happen again!
Do you understand me?

01:22.024 --> 01:23.489
I'm hungry! If I want
a banana, I'll take it!

01:23.586 --> 01:25.096
What you'll take is
two rotations of EMI.

01:25.261 --> 01:27.129
Report to the boat.
The rest of you

01:27.245 --> 01:29.686
- continue searching for our missing
people! - We shouldn't even be here!

01:29.800 --> 01:31.336
Report to the boat.
I gave you an order. Follow it.

01:31.438 --> 01:33.534
So throw me in the brig.
They can't do this without us.

01:33.633 --> 01:35.581
Ask the COB, without us,
they have to surrender,

01:35.708 --> 01:36.938
and we all go home.

01:37.823 --> 01:38.962
Here.

01:39.575 --> 01:41.221
Here's your uniform.
Take it.

01:41.355 --> 01:43.010
You gonna give us
a pole dance now, Parker?

01:44.758 --> 01:45.758
Very nice.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.012
Put him in the brig.

01:49.311 --> 01:50.713
Hoffman, put him in the brig.

01:50.804 --> 01:52.192
Right now.

01:54.726 --> 01:56.078
Get off me!

01:57.454 --> 01:58.799
(Shouting in foreign language)
<i>What?</i>

02:03.669 --> 02:05.292
(Dog barking in distance)

02:08.637 --> 02:11.145
Last anyone saw Redman
was mid-rats yesterday.

02:11.266 --> 02:12.212
And we've scoured the island--

02:12.330 --> 02:14.181
still no sign of Cortez
or Brannan, either.

02:14.540 --> 02:16.311
This doesn't feel like
an AWOL situation.

02:16.417 --> 02:17.649
That's because it's not.

02:17.792 --> 02:18.993
(Phone rings)

02:19.473 --> 02:21.426
(Ring)

02:22.784 --> 02:23.396
(Beep)

02:24.256 --> 02:26.822
This is Captain Marcus Chaplin
of the USS Colorado.

02:26.953 --> 02:28.382
To whom am I speaking?

02:28.626 --> 02:30.600
White House Senior Adviser
Amanda Straugh.

02:30.695 --> 02:32.296
I've been named
as your negotiator.

02:32.404 --> 02:35.119
Congratulations, Miss Straugh.
I admired your work in Kosovo.

02:35.232 --> 02:38.063
Mr. Chaplin, the blockade
is set to close by nightfall.

02:38.151 --> 02:40.205
I think you understand
the ramifications of this,

02:40.306 --> 02:41.818
as does your crew.

02:41.968 --> 02:43.691
Unless you surrender
unconditionally,

02:43.825 --> 02:46.286
you will be effectively
cut off from the world.

02:46.636 --> 02:48.245
Your boss tried to kill
every man and woman

02:48.336 --> 02:50.973
on my boat, and now you expect
unconditional surrender.

02:51.106 --> 02:52.211
That's a bit of a reach,
isn't it,

02:52.313 --> 02:54.741
considering the 17 tridents
still in my control?

02:56.255 --> 02:58.090
Think of your son Jeffrey.

03:00.206 --> 03:02.037
My son is dead.

03:02.160 --> 03:04.518
And the marines hoped
to give him a proper funeral.

03:04.756 --> 03:07.177
Mr. Chaplin, there will be
no burial for your son

03:07.303 --> 03:08.572
until you surrender.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.394
His remains will rest
in a Navy morgue

03:10.512 --> 03:13.003
until that time--
indefinitely.

03:13.378 --> 03:15.252
For your crew, for your son,

03:15.461 --> 03:16.732
do what's right.

03:18.859 --> 03:20.176
(Clicks switch)

03:24.615 --> 03:25.869
What's on your mind, XO?

03:25.986 --> 03:27.395
We got a problem with the crew.

03:27.839 --> 03:29.162
(Chain rattling)

03:31.003 --> 03:32.838
(Panting) Don't tell me
you're both under arrest, too.

03:32.942 --> 03:35.146
- We're getting full up here.
- Heard about Brannan and Cortez?

03:35.282 --> 03:36.292
And Redman.

03:36.594 --> 03:38.046
All missing.

03:38.599 --> 03:39.753
Crew thinks they're AWOL.

03:39.865 --> 03:42.636
- They're not AWOL.
- For once, you and me agree, Junior.

03:42.833 --> 03:44.088
You want to be a part
of the effort to find them?

03:44.184 --> 03:45.371
You don't think I know
what's going on?

03:45.468 --> 03:46.757
You're losing control.

03:47.194 --> 03:48.735
I'm more powerful in here
than out.

03:48.846 --> 03:50.688
Yeah, I see you've found
yourself a bully pulpit.

03:50.791 --> 03:52.314
And you found a way
to spite your country

03:52.403 --> 03:53.952
for Jeffrey's death.

03:55.082 --> 03:57.510
You and I want the same thing--
me in front of a court-martial,

03:57.642 --> 03:59.293
where one of us will be
proven right.

03:59.676 --> 04:01.074
Meanwhile, here you sit,
watching,

04:01.241 --> 04:02.477
while three of your own
go missing

04:02.608 --> 04:04.498
and your men slowly
start to unravel.

04:05.183 --> 04:06.181
(Panting)

04:08.341 --> 04:09.681
I never thought I'd see you
put anything

04:09.804 --> 04:12.496
ahead of your people, Joe--
least of all, pride.

04:13.795 --> 04:14.855
(Exhales sharply)

04:15.001 --> 04:16.486
So give me your word
that if I release you,

04:16.600 --> 04:17.901
you will not undermine me,

04:18.011 --> 04:19.858
you will not sabotage
my people or my boat.

04:19.971 --> 04:22.530
You will help me get back home
to a court-martial,

04:22.678 --> 04:23.987
where you can be
the star witness

04:24.130 --> 04:25.402
for the prosecution.

04:26.330 --> 04:27.998
(Chief panting)

04:28.796 --> 04:30.900
My word still good enough
for you?

04:31.020 --> 04:32.270
Yes.

04:32.850 --> 04:33.627
(Sighs)

04:39.669 --> 04:40.710
You have my word.

04:40.817 --> 04:42.305
Unlock the COB!

04:47.446 --> 04:48.828
It ain't good enough for me.

04:50.832 --> 04:51.998
I'll be watching you, COB.

04:54.289 --> 04:56.446
(Keys jingling, chain clatters)

04:56.554 --> 04:58.455
Get your blouse on, partner.

04:58.825 --> 05:01.095
It's not casual Friday
around here.

05:01.278 --> 05:02.347
Sir.

05:03.431 --> 05:05.344
(Bottles clinking,
indistinct conversations)

05:10.122 --> 05:11.582
Are you coming or not?

05:11.706 --> 05:12.600
Dinner's in six hours.

05:12.698 --> 05:14.614
You think there's a bus?
We have to hurry.

05:14.712 --> 05:16.474
- Bar's closed, you guys.
- Raise.

05:16.763 --> 05:17.900
A hundred.

05:20.342 --> 05:21.774
(Engine starts in distance)

05:24.080 --> 05:25.691
Where'd you get this?

05:32.577 --> 05:34.624
Don't say I never did
anything for you.

05:34.742 --> 05:35.702
This belongs to Cortez.

05:35.810 --> 05:38.130
Yeah. Got it from a guy who
works for a guy named Serrat.

05:38.809 --> 05:40.496
Friend of the French lady.

05:46.956 --> 05:48.709
You didn't write,
you didn't call.

05:48.808 --> 05:50.806
You didn't hang yourself
with your shoelaces.

05:50.952 --> 05:53.049
We all have our disappointments
to muster.

05:54.053 --> 05:55.354
You're blocking my way, COB.

05:56.125 --> 05:57.543
Am I?

06:00.030 --> 06:01.370
Stop.

06:01.923 --> 06:03.473
Thanks for the dance, ma'am.

06:07.013 --> 06:09.095
I don't think Julian Serrat
has friends.

06:10.199 --> 06:12.244
- Ooh... _
- Hey.

06:12.417 --> 06:14.085
Look, we just want to know
who we're dealing with here.

06:14.183 --> 06:16.667
She said no. It's time
for you to leave now.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.834
Listen.
Right now my people

06:18.959 --> 06:20.638
are being held
in some room somewhere.

06:20.733 --> 06:22.759
They have no say in anything
that's happening to them.

06:22.887 --> 06:25.165
They are scared.
They just want to go home.

06:25.564 --> 06:26.760
I want to see that they do.

06:27.980 --> 06:30.474
I'll talk to Julian.
With your captain.

06:30.782 --> 06:33.468
- Just you and my captain?
- Yes.

06:33.671 --> 06:35.303
No one else.
That's how it must be.

06:35.409 --> 06:36.624
I can't promise you'll be safe.

06:36.732 --> 06:38.360
I'm not the one
you have to worry about.

06:38.461 --> 06:40.423
He's... how do you put it?

06:40.585 --> 06:42.894
Uh... he's sweet on me.

06:44.818 --> 06:46.121
_

06:46.231 --> 06:48.242
_

06:48.362 --> 06:49.902
_

06:50.553 --> 06:52.237
_

06:56.034 --> 06:58.614
_

06:58.865 --> 07:00.610
_

07:01.621 --> 07:04.448
If you're not here by 6:00,
I won't wait for you.

07:10.011 --> 07:11.507
(Soft thud)

07:12.627 --> 07:14.202
(Silverware clatters)

07:15.769 --> 07:17.896
(Footsteps approach)

07:18.985 --> 07:20.888
(Silverware clattering)

07:23.277 --> 07:25.250
What kind of man
is your captain?

07:26.861 --> 07:30.452
He's either a stupid man
or a very disrespectful man

07:30.656 --> 07:31.855
or both.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.748
Why won't he come to me?
How many must I take?

07:33.865 --> 07:35.267
10? 20?

07:35.735 --> 07:37.057
Can you figure it out?

07:37.558 --> 07:38.747
What is your name?

07:41.658 --> 07:42.531
Red.

07:42.642 --> 07:43.612
Red.

07:43.711 --> 07:45.237
Everyone on this island
knows--

07:45.360 --> 07:48.556
if you have a problem,
you come to Julian Serrat.

07:49.942 --> 07:51.947
For instance, just today

07:52.173 --> 07:54.749
a boy was brought to me,
only 15--

07:55.035 --> 07:57.065
shot in the neck.

07:58.546 --> 08:01.202
He died in the jungle during
a battle your people were in.

08:01.462 --> 08:02.325
We don't shoot kids.

08:02.432 --> 08:03.907
Nevertheless, he was shot.

08:09.565 --> 08:11.478
(Grunts)
Someone has to pay now.

08:11.584 --> 08:13.487
Hey! Listen.

08:13.581 --> 08:16.183
Can I talk to you?
Privately?

08:17.520 --> 08:19.475
I'll make it worth your while.

08:26.717 --> 08:29.370
(Knife slices fruit) (Exhales)

08:29.541 --> 08:33.311
<i>Pakistan had developed several</i>
<i>portable nuclear devices.</i>

08:33.431 --> 08:35.258
<i>Our intelligence determined...</i>

08:35.397 --> 08:37.039
(Volume increases) <i>that Pakistani
government operatives</i>

08:37.169 --> 08:39.914
<i>had placed those devices</i>
<i>in the hands of terrorists,</i>

08:40.038 --> 08:41.865
<i>- and that they were about</i>
<i>to be taken.</i>- What's going on?

08:41.982 --> 08:44.149
Preemptive nuclear war
is our new official policy.

08:44.267 --> 08:45.598
(Cell phone rings)
That's what's happening.

08:45.740 --> 08:46.677
Where's the remote?

08:46.811 --> 08:48.111
- Turn it down!
- Hello?

08:48.603 --> 08:49.636
<i>...and decisively.</i>

08:49.766 --> 08:51.148
<i>A nuclear response</i>
<i>was the only one</i>

08:51.250 --> 08:53.345
<i>that guaranteed American
safe--</i> (Volume muted)

08:53.450 --> 08:55.861
Yes. I'm watching.
It's terrifying.

08:56.510 --> 08:57.646
Why?

09:00.203 --> 09:02.207
Yes. I know it.

09:02.313 --> 09:03.455
Okay.

09:07.395 --> 09:09.109
I have to meet someone.

09:09.279 --> 09:10.504
Now?

09:10.833 --> 09:12.077
If you're so worried
about that hard drive,

09:12.192 --> 09:14.569
- you should put it in a safe deposit box.
- Robert, all of the tech

09:14.708 --> 09:16.398
for the prototype
on the "Colorado" is on here.

09:16.512 --> 09:17.825
The only schematic.

09:17.943 --> 09:19.613
You think
I'd entrust that to a bank?

09:19.724 --> 09:21.246
(Chuckles)
That is completely paranoid.

09:22.113 --> 09:23.454
(Chuckles) I know.

09:25.475 --> 09:27.092
Don't let anyone in.

09:28.306 --> 09:29.384
I'm not waiting up for you.

09:29.498 --> 09:31.354
Sure, you will.
(Door closes)

09:33.388 --> 09:35.264
(Kylie) Admiral Shepard?

09:38.974 --> 09:39.922
Knock, knock.

09:40.034 --> 09:41.810
Marcus Chaplin claims
that the nuke order

09:41.935 --> 09:45.124
sent to the "Colorado" came
through the Antarctic Network,

09:45.262 --> 09:46.308
not the main network.

09:46.421 --> 09:48.684
Which is impossible, because
we weren't under attack.

09:48.834 --> 09:50.621
And who believes
a trigger-happy madman anyway?

09:50.736 --> 09:52.171
Well, you do.
That's why you came.

09:52.278 --> 09:53.743
I need to know who sent
that order.

09:53.871 --> 09:56.056
Let me just ask my friend Linus
in Naval Intelligence.

09:56.381 --> 09:58.897
Oh, wait. He's lying
comatose in a hospital

09:59.018 --> 10:00.920
because of a shellfish allergy.

10:01.045 --> 10:02.223
I'm allergic to nothing,
by the way,

10:02.347 --> 10:04.480
so if that happens, throw
a flag on the play, will you?

10:04.607 --> 10:07.034
Your friend Linus was nobody,
but you're not.

10:07.139 --> 10:08.876
Your father golfs
with the President,

10:08.998 --> 10:10.905
and I read somewhere
where you're one of DC's

10:11.034 --> 10:12.754
most eligible bachelorettes.

10:12.903 --> 10:14.070
Hmm. Well, look where
that's got me.

10:14.244 --> 10:16.213
You're uniquely qualified
to do something about this.

10:16.342 --> 10:18.392
Uniquely qualified
to risk my own ass

10:18.517 --> 10:20.021
to help you save your daughter?

10:20.140 --> 10:21.312
Who do you think I am?

10:22.072 --> 10:23.735
You're a parasite
who traffics in war

10:23.846 --> 10:25.596
without ever getting
her hands dirty,

10:25.721 --> 10:27.490
and this country
has made you rich

10:27.618 --> 10:29.388
buying your family's weapons.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.843
Aren't you ready to do
something in return?

10:33.000 --> 10:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:41.272 --> 10:43.342
It's the file number
of the order.

10:45.141 --> 10:46.954
Patriotic enough for you?

10:47.068 --> 10:48.787
You do care.
This will help me.

10:48.895 --> 10:51.323
And it will help the people
that believe as I do.

10:51.428 --> 10:54.735
But you still need to ask
the questions that I can't.

10:54.851 --> 10:56.820
Make some noise, Miss Sinclair.

11:02.701 --> 11:04.220
(Dog barking in distance)

11:05.234 --> 11:06.663
What did you say to him?

11:07.258 --> 11:08.681
It's not what she said.

11:09.503 --> 11:10.817
It's what she did.

11:11.964 --> 11:13.464
Thank you, Cortez.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.054
(Man shouts in French)

11:18.761 --> 11:20.123
(Grunting)

11:21.142 --> 11:22.224
(Grunts)

11:23.609 --> 11:25.116
(Coughing)

11:26.183 --> 11:27.018
(Brakes squeal)

11:28.320 --> 11:30.253
(Panting)

11:44.521 --> 11:45.899
Julian.

11:46.263 --> 11:48.415
This is Captain Marcus Chaplin.

11:48.954 --> 11:50.425
He's lost a few of his men,

11:50.548 --> 11:52.382
and I told him you could help.

11:53.433 --> 11:54.629
Welcome.

11:55.397 --> 11:56.763
I was wondering when I could
expect a visit

11:56.886 --> 11:58.287
from the great captain.

11:58.408 --> 11:59.754
You and your submarine
have caused a commotion

11:59.863 --> 12:01.190
in our little paradise.

12:01.323 --> 12:03.215
We're grateful to find
a harbor here.

12:03.404 --> 12:05.468
We are glad to temporarily
accommodate you.

12:05.575 --> 12:07.319
I'm missing three crew members.

12:07.793 --> 12:09.083
You should have come
to me sooner!

12:09.749 --> 12:11.575
But you are here now.
That is what is important.

12:11.683 --> 12:14.071
- I see I've come to the right man.
- Yes, you have.

12:14.887 --> 12:16.081
I'm the right man.

12:18.731 --> 12:20.503
(Woman sobbing)

12:21.588 --> 12:23.064
Those people there--

12:23.940 --> 12:26.233
their son was killed because
of your interference here.

12:26.356 --> 12:28.278
You brought violence
to this island.

12:28.407 --> 12:30.818
Now this child is dead,
and this woman is in mourning.

12:31.093 --> 12:32.539
As are we all.

12:33.842 --> 12:35.133
I'm paying for
their son's funeral.

12:35.256 --> 12:37.009
I understand our presence here
has been a burden,

12:37.119 --> 12:38.122
but there's no need for us
to quarrel,

12:38.232 --> 12:41.634
because if we do, you'll lose.

12:43.060 --> 12:45.448
A death by a thousand cuts.

12:45.825 --> 12:47.375
That would be war with me.

12:48.541 --> 12:50.080
(Speaks foreign language)

12:55.957 --> 12:59.140
A blockade surrounds
this island.

12:59.505 --> 13:02.537
I have a boat
with very valuable cargo.

13:02.673 --> 13:04.001
And I'm so concerned
about this boat,

13:04.111 --> 13:06.023
I can't think about
your missing crewmen.

13:09.501 --> 13:12.146
We have the means
to get what you want

13:13.219 --> 13:15.210
if you have the means
to return my crewmen.

13:17.855 --> 13:19.126
Okay.

13:21.616 --> 13:23.343
They will stay
with the body all night.

13:24.026 --> 13:26.360
At dawn, we will prepare
the boy for burial.

13:26.882 --> 13:30.223
You have a debt to these people
that I have paid.

13:30.551 --> 13:33.895
But before dawn, you must
bring me what you owe me.

13:34.034 --> 13:34.779
That's not much time.

13:34.902 --> 13:36.423
Yes, I know.

13:37.135 --> 13:38.894
I wish you had
come to me sooner.

13:42.967 --> 13:44.541
(Engine rumbling)

13:49.260 --> 13:50.756
Serrat didn't give you
much time.

13:50.869 --> 13:52.001
Will you be able to do it?

13:52.231 --> 13:53.273
We have to.

13:54.728 --> 13:56.142
Good luck with everything.

13:56.651 --> 13:57.605
Uh, good-bye.

13:59.809 --> 14:00.923
Good-bye.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.210
(Engine starts)

14:04.588 --> 14:06.045
(Dog barking)

14:15.199 --> 14:16.150
I'm awake.

14:16.258 --> 14:17.558
We're almost there.

14:18.138 --> 14:19.944
You didn't tell me
it'd take this long.

14:21.071 --> 14:23.721
I had no idea
you were so fragile.

14:25.421 --> 14:27.001
I can't believe
this is where you live.

14:28.187 --> 14:29.695
My mother came here a lot.

14:29.809 --> 14:31.473
Yeah? Is she as much of
a ball-buster as you?

14:31.578 --> 14:33.742
Not anymore. She died.

14:34.861 --> 14:35.993
I'm sorry.

14:36.092 --> 14:37.132
Me, too.

14:37.242 --> 14:39.346
What about your parents?
Are they still alive?

14:39.451 --> 14:40.754
Yep.

14:41.062 --> 14:43.412
That's it? Just "yep"?

14:44.930 --> 14:46.095
Yep.

14:50.002 --> 14:52.108
(Motor revving)

15:02.163 --> 15:03.175
Crew looks good.

15:03.294 --> 15:04.352
They know what's at stake.

15:04.454 --> 15:07.242
Can't say I like the idea of
being a bagman for a drug lord.

15:07.352 --> 15:09.424
And I don't like the idea
of a war on two fronts.

15:09.538 --> 15:10.469
I don't recall
giving you permission

15:10.579 --> 15:11.700
to speak freely, COB.

15:12.723 --> 15:15.587
Sorry, sir.
I'm a little rusty.

15:18.665 --> 15:20.011
(Amplified voice)
Crew, this is the XO.

15:20.343 --> 15:21.480
We all know
what we're about to do,

15:21.577 --> 15:22.696
and we know why we're doing it.

15:22.806 --> 15:25.244
Brannan, Cortez, and Redman
are all counting on us.

15:25.486 --> 15:27.708
Let's go get our people back.
XO out.

15:29.365 --> 15:31.159
You're approaching the ships
in the blockade, sir.

15:31.599 --> 15:33.037
(Clicks switch)

15:33.646 --> 15:36.104
Engineering,
ready the Perseus prototype.

15:36.742 --> 15:39.312
XO, it'll take a moment to power up.
(Clicks switch)

15:43.258 --> 15:45.612
(Beeping, electrical surge)

15:46.275 --> 15:47.883
(Clank)

15:48.652 --> 15:51.703
(Whirring, rattling)

15:52.123 --> 15:52.640
(Beeping)

15:53.357 --> 15:54.722
(Beeping)

15:55.045 --> 15:57.075
You're gone, sir.
Screens are clear.

15:57.185 --> 15:58.699
The "Colorado's" disappeared.

15:59.830 --> 16:01.895
(Kendal)
Helm, 0-6-0, ahead full.

16:02.006 --> 16:04.670
Cameron, set a clock.
We have nine hours to sunrise.

16:06.432 --> 16:08.043
(Beeps)

16:10.740 --> 16:11.978
Hey. I need a favor.

16:12.093 --> 16:13.302
I need your senator
to requisition

16:13.409 --> 16:15.566
a time stamp on order 998.

16:15.658 --> 16:17.818
Came through the Antarctic
Network to the "Colorado."

16:17.937 --> 16:19.549
You mean the thing
Chaplin talked about on TV?

16:19.669 --> 16:20.853
It's a Cold War relic.
It's only supposed to be used

16:20.987 --> 16:23.060
if someone hit DC
with the big one.

16:25.668 --> 16:27.007
Please?

16:27.735 --> 16:32.077
Please, please, please?

16:33.119 --> 16:34.097
(Chuckles)

16:34.192 --> 16:36.228
I-I'll, uh...
I'll work on it.

16:37.525 --> 16:38.979
(Whispers) Thank you.

16:44.505 --> 16:46.867
Hey, Robert, make sure
it goes through the senator.

16:47.479 --> 16:48.903
Don't do it yourself.

16:50.514 --> 16:51.281
(Door closes)

16:54.807 --> 16:56.208
Approaching the blockade, sir.

16:57.369 --> 17:00.053
Captain, I hold 2 destroyers.
5,000 yards on each side.

17:00.924 --> 17:02.740
XO, we're gonna have
to pass in between them.

17:03.125 --> 17:04.333
(Electrical surge,
alarm wailing)

17:04.434 --> 17:05.413
Perseus is offline.

17:05.521 --> 17:06.952
(Grace) Sir, I have a sonar
location on you.

17:07.057 --> 17:07.757
They can hear you.

17:07.855 --> 17:09.675
I repeat-- you are not masked.

17:09.770 --> 17:11.728
Engineering, conn.
Get the perseus back online now.

17:11.840 --> 17:12.858
Aye, sir.

17:13.615 --> 17:14.944
(Rapid beeping)

17:16.454 --> 17:17.888
(Beeps)

17:18.165 --> 17:21.548
Conn, engineering, sir.
All systems back online, sir.

17:21.657 --> 17:22.881
(Grace) You're off
the screens again.

17:23.550 --> 17:24.798
Any movement on the destroyers?

17:25.527 --> 17:26.451
Holding position.

17:26.560 --> 17:27.739
(Chaplin)
Looks like we got lucky.

17:27.834 --> 17:29.089
Helm, ahead flank.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.753
Diving officer,
make your depth 600 feet.

17:31.854 --> 17:33.414
Proceed with the mission.

17:42.726 --> 17:44.602
(Chaplin) Let's get that cargo
on board.

17:48.516 --> 17:50.562
Watch yourself.
Here you go.

17:50.950 --> 17:52.256
(Amplified voice) Cargo on board
right on schedule.

17:52.355 --> 17:54.004
(Hatch clanks shut)
Last man down. Hatch secured.

17:54.111 --> 17:55.705
Lock them up in supply.
Don't open them.

17:55.810 --> 17:57.269
Aye, XO. What's in 'em?

17:57.389 --> 17:58.658
Three lives.

18:03.236 --> 18:05.134
(Insects chirping)

18:08.754 --> 18:10.824
So you just left civilization
and never looked back?

18:10.928 --> 18:11.875
Yeah.

18:11.974 --> 18:13.740
At first I thought this place
was just my heritage,

18:13.922 --> 18:15.634
but it turned out to be
my salvation.

18:15.792 --> 18:17.573
Others of us weren't so lucky.

18:17.958 --> 18:19.979
Most people don't have
the courage to do that.

18:20.105 --> 18:21.949
They talk about it--
just live off the grid

18:22.052 --> 18:23.810
or have a clean start
or whatever.

18:23.919 --> 18:25.194
You actually did it.

18:26.615 --> 18:29.318
- And next week, Aitu becomes a man.
- Right.

18:29.441 --> 18:30.761
There's a--
there's this ritual.

18:30.906 --> 18:33.403
It's awesome. And after that,
I can apprentice.

18:34.589 --> 18:35.360
<i>What?</i>

18:35.484 --> 18:36.916
Manu agreed to take him on.

18:38.258 --> 18:40.079
That wasn't the plan.

18:40.180 --> 18:42.694
- We'll talk about it later.
- No, we'll talk about it now!

18:42.976 --> 18:44.459
What did you say to him?

18:44.665 --> 18:45.986
He deserves to have a life.

18:46.102 --> 18:47.870
- I like my life.
- You don't know the difference!

18:47.995 --> 18:49.061
Tani, he changed his mind.

18:49.177 --> 18:51.067
No, <i>you</i> changed his mind!

18:51.617 --> 18:53.417
You won't stop, will you?

18:54.275 --> 18:58.309
How many lives in this family
do you plan on ruining?

18:58.872 --> 18:59.949
(Rustling)

19:02.757 --> 19:05.247
My daughter storms off,
the sun comes up.

19:05.357 --> 19:07.098
It's expected. Stay.

19:07.206 --> 19:08.258
Thank you for your hospitality,

19:08.389 --> 19:10.097
but I'm gonna dance
with the one that brung me.

19:11.104 --> 19:12.459
Good night, sir.

19:19.578 --> 19:22.541
(Electricity powers off, clank)

19:22.947 --> 19:24.468
(Alarm wailing)

19:25.286 --> 19:26.191
(Monitor beeping,
alarm wailing)

19:26.278 --> 19:26.993
Engineering, conn.

19:27.109 --> 19:28.239
The Perseus is
draining my power.

19:28.357 --> 19:30.289
(Peterson) Sir, it's starting
to burn through circuits.

19:30.404 --> 19:31.187
We don't shut it down,

19:31.295 --> 19:32.659
it's gonna shut <i>us</i> down.

19:33.215 --> 19:35.562
(Alarm continues wailing)
Turn the damn thing off.

19:35.671 --> 19:38.417
- Diving Officer, make your
depth 1,000 feet. - Yes, sir.

19:38.536 --> 19:40.144
(Alarm stops wailing) We're gonna have
to do this the old-fashioned way.

19:40.266 --> 19:42.129
- XO, rig for silent.
- Rig ship for silent running.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.160
Secure all fans.
Rig ship for silent running.

19:44.915 --> 19:47.099
(Electrical surge, alarm beeps)

19:47.214 --> 19:48.446
Captain, four stop
on fire control.

19:48.595 --> 19:50.462
- What the hell, Peterson?
- COB, stay here.

19:50.572 --> 19:53.103
- Moore, get back to the engine room.
- I got it.

19:53.234 --> 19:56.897
Old Navy saying-- "Don't let
the COB sabotage the sub."

20:00.244 --> 20:01.940
Prosser, keep a lid on it.
Keep a lid on it.

20:02.055 --> 20:03.692
Gentlemen, stow this problem,

20:03.792 --> 20:05.421
or we're all gonna be dead
in about one minute.

20:05.694 --> 20:07.100
Am I clear?

20:08.810 --> 20:09.777
Clear, sir.

20:09.890 --> 20:11.868
- Approaching the blockade.
(Man) - Noted.

20:11.979 --> 20:13.079
Destroyer turning on our position.
(Rapid beeping)

20:13.173 --> 20:14.838
- Breaking the perimeter.
- Helm, all stop.

20:14.954 --> 20:15.957
Yes, sir, all stop.

20:16.173 --> 20:19.427
- Diving Officer, take us down
another 300. - Yes, sir.

20:20.181 --> 20:21.135
But do it gently.

20:21.237 --> 20:23.805
Sir, you've got two destroyers
headed your way. (Beeping)

20:24.836 --> 20:26.619
Sir?
(Static crackling)

20:27.233 --> 20:28.804
(Static crackling) Sir?

20:33.646 --> 20:35.811
(Beeping) They'll have
alerted the blockade.

20:35.957 --> 20:38.279
Gentlemen, we have the entire
fleet to contend with.

20:38.773 --> 20:40.711
- Depth?
- 1,300.

20:41.333 --> 20:42.089
(Creaking)

20:42.208 --> 20:43.636
You hear that?

20:43.915 --> 20:46.689
She always moans a little
at 1,300 feet.

20:46.797 --> 20:47.850
That's her G-spot.

20:47.995 --> 20:49.089
(Chuckles)

20:49.812 --> 20:52.038
(Sonar pinging faintly)

20:52.725 --> 20:54.464
Destroyer still
approaching aft.

20:55.085 --> 20:58.121
(Pinging, creaking continue)

20:59.647 --> 21:01.346
- Deeper.
- Yes, sir.

21:01.911 --> 21:03.503
You going for the record,
Captain?

21:03.651 --> 21:05.239
Oh, she'll take it.

21:05.633 --> 21:07.264
Yes, she will.

21:07.899 --> 21:10.380
(Pinging and creaking continue)

21:10.481 --> 21:12.060
1,800.

21:12.726 --> 21:15.347
(Pinging continues)

21:16.059 --> 21:17.689
She's passing
directly above us.

21:21.328 --> 21:22.657
(Whoosh)

21:25.557 --> 21:26.657
Depth charges in the water!

21:26.752 --> 21:28.244
Helm, ready ahead
flank on the pop.

21:28.345 --> 21:30.353
Make your course 1-8-5.

21:30.448 --> 21:32.089
Second destroyer
approaching aft. More charges!

21:32.187 --> 21:33.476
Wait for the pop.
(Rapid beeping)

21:33.777 --> 21:36.426
(Explosion) All ahead
flank, right full rudder!

21:36.576 --> 21:38.617
Steady! 1-8-5!
Get us around now!

21:38.773 --> 21:42.014
(Explosion) Contact bearing 1-4-4.
20 knots. Aegis cruiser.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.906
(Rapid beeping)
Helm, all ahead flank.

21:44.101 --> 21:45.532
Diving Officer,
20 degree up-angle.

21:45.645 --> 21:46.849
Contact! She has friends.

21:47.038 --> 21:48.335
Multiple, on the same heading.

21:48.500 --> 21:51.250
Destroyers. Three.
No, four.

21:51.334 --> 21:52.511
(Clicks switch)
Depth charge in the water.

21:52.623 --> 21:53.820
(Explosion)
Full rise on the planes.

21:53.921 --> 21:55.311
(Explosion)
Get us up. Maximum bubble.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.032
(Explosion)

21:57.665 --> 21:59.521
(Pinging continues)

21:59.595 --> 22:00.482
All stop.

22:00.572 --> 22:01.760
Dead in the water, XO.

22:01.979 --> 22:03.362
- Confirm that order. All stop.
- All stop.

22:03.485 --> 22:05.288
Aye, Captain.
They're right on us.

22:06.841 --> 22:08.303
Nobody moves.

22:08.749 --> 22:14.029
(Pinging continues)

22:15.115 --> 22:16.340
(Sonar pinging fades)

22:16.422 --> 22:17.615
Contact's passing.

22:17.717 --> 22:19.103
That's
a standard 3-charge pattern.

22:19.198 --> 22:21.822
You'll hear it--
one, two, three.

22:22.289 --> 22:23.919
(Explosion)

22:24.297 --> 22:26.040
(Explosion)

22:26.889 --> 22:28.662
(Explosion)

22:29.653 --> 22:32.115
(Sighs) They're not
coming back, sir.

22:34.283 --> 22:36.915
XO, take us back to the beach.

22:38.060 --> 22:39.206
(Hands sliding, thud)

22:39.578 --> 22:40.848
(Thud echoes)

22:42.545 --> 22:49.485
(Sonar pinging resumes)

22:51.493 --> 22:53.366
Sonar's acquired us.

22:53.628 --> 22:54.524
(Alarm wailing)

22:54.623 --> 22:56.650
Destroyer coming about on
our position heading 3-3-9!

23:00.587 --> 23:01.980
(Explosion)

23:02.609 --> 23:03.653
(Explosion)

23:04.396 --> 23:06.594
(Sonar pinging)

23:06.766 --> 23:08.071
(Explosion)

23:10.444 --> 23:12.110
(Explosion)

23:16.624 --> 23:19.680
_

23:29.281 --> 23:31.977
Helm, steer course 3-2-0.

23:32.085 --> 23:34.275
Ridge at a range
of 2,000 yards, closing fast.

23:34.409 --> 23:35.729
That's a wall, sir.
Right up to the surface.

23:35.822 --> 23:37.966
No, it's a canyon. They'd be
crazy to come after us.

23:39.066 --> 23:40.088
(Explosion)

23:40.457 --> 23:42.372
(Pinging and creaking)

23:44.190 --> 23:46.010
(Explosion) You sure
about the clearance?

23:46.590 --> 23:47.885
(Pinging continues)

23:47.986 --> 23:49.680
Even if we fit, we can't
hide in there forever.

23:49.772 --> 23:51.987
We're not gonna hide.
We're going through.

23:52.513 --> 23:54.693
(Explosion) Sir, they have
us acquired and ranged.

23:54.792 --> 23:56.833
- Closing on us for another pass.
- This is gonna be tight.

23:57.144 --> 23:59.329
(Alarm wailing) Rig the boat for
sound collision, no alarms!

24:01.665 --> 24:03.247
Steady as she goes.

24:03.759 --> 24:05.219
(Pinging continues)

24:10.659 --> 24:12.297
(King) Tani!

24:13.023 --> 24:15.307
(Birds and insects chirping)

24:19.037 --> 24:20.670
You gonna sleep here or what?

24:20.787 --> 24:22.119
Maybe.

24:27.660 --> 24:29.685
Sorry your dad
didn't hate me more.

24:31.096 --> 24:33.669
That was the idea, right?
Bring the invader to dinner?

24:33.866 --> 24:36.006
Yes...
(Flicks lighter)

24:36.101 --> 24:37.750
That was the idea.

24:37.857 --> 24:39.725
You know, in high school
I was the go-to guy

24:39.843 --> 24:42.191
for girls looking to piss off
their fathers.

24:42.307 --> 24:43.929
- He doesn't seem that bad.
- Oh, shut up.

24:44.031 --> 24:45.381
I'm just saying, I don't know
what you worked out

24:45.486 --> 24:46.945
with your brother,
but he seems pretty happy here.

24:47.056 --> 24:49.286
(Flicks lighter) You know, it's
really none of your business.

24:49.386 --> 24:52.518
No. My business is about
9,000 miles away.

24:55.217 --> 24:56.704
So what is this place?

24:56.794 --> 24:58.577
She's buried here.

25:01.676 --> 25:04.114
I brought her
some ginger candy.

25:04.235 --> 25:06.440
It's kind of...
I don't know,

25:06.668 --> 25:08.687
a way of saying hi, I guess.

25:09.680 --> 25:12.703
You know, he's not
a good man, my father.

25:13.421 --> 25:15.224
When my mother got sick,
he convinced her

25:15.345 --> 25:17.373
she should be treated here.

25:18.259 --> 25:19.629
You know,

25:20.001 --> 25:22.719
traditional medicine
and all that nonsense.

25:24.394 --> 25:27.002
Didn't want to take her
back to Australia...

25:30.334 --> 25:32.201
So she went along.

25:33.331 --> 25:35.529
Always appeasing him.

25:39.494 --> 25:42.032
She was in a lot of pain
at the end.

25:45.931 --> 25:49.552
I was waiting
for Aitu to be old enough

25:50.736 --> 25:53.560
to get him away from here.

25:53.700 --> 25:56.104
Look... Tani,

25:56.877 --> 25:59.402
just 'cause he's staying
doesn't mean you have to.

26:15.981 --> 26:17.844
(Sirens wailing in distance)

26:20.299 --> 26:21.125
(Switch clicks)

26:22.712 --> 26:24.398
(Door opens)

26:24.616 --> 26:26.158
Hello, Robert.

26:27.877 --> 26:29.602
Do you know who I am?

26:29.747 --> 26:31.622
- Y-yes, of course.
- Well, good.

26:32.155 --> 26:33.986
Then this won't take long.

26:36.145 --> 26:38.421
(Shower running)

26:38.568 --> 26:40.391
(Door closes, shower turns off)

26:40.518 --> 26:41.856
(Thud)

26:43.688 --> 26:45.253
Robert?

26:51.064 --> 26:52.686
(Switch clicks)

26:53.858 --> 26:55.648
Robert, are you here?

27:12.098 --> 27:13.423
(Gasps)

27:20.158 --> 27:22.697
Why were you the one
the girls would bring home?

27:23.163 --> 27:24.907
I guess they thought
they could fix me.

27:25.253 --> 27:26.504
Did they?

27:26.642 --> 27:27.938
Only one came close.

27:28.051 --> 27:30.161
- What was her name?
- US Navy.

27:30.300 --> 27:32.187
But we're going through a bit
of a rough patch at the moment.

27:32.311 --> 27:33.479
She showed you the world.

27:33.584 --> 27:35.249
World ain't all
it's cracked up to be.

27:35.794 --> 27:38.047
(Water falling)

27:38.210 --> 27:39.322
Do you hear that?

27:40.781 --> 27:42.709
That's where Aitu will come
for his ritual.

27:42.822 --> 27:44.086
What does he have to do?

27:48.913 --> 27:49.967
Hey!

27:57.583 --> 27:58.837
(Gasps)

28:05.297 --> 28:07.486
Whoo!
(Laughing)

28:09.489 --> 28:11.760
Congratulations.
You're a man.

28:11.860 --> 28:13.838
Yeah? What does that make you, then?
(Laughs)

28:17.144 --> 28:18.817
My mom used to bring me here.

28:18.920 --> 28:20.520
It was our little secret.

28:21.161 --> 28:23.762
It's only supposed to be
for the boys...

28:24.060 --> 28:26.119
like most things around here.

28:30.317 --> 28:32.432
That's the thing
about this place.

28:33.399 --> 28:35.908
The best things
never last for long.

28:38.602 --> 28:41.474
We should go.
It's a long walk back.

28:46.294 --> 28:47.256
(Chaplin)
Sit-rep, Master Chief?

28:47.351 --> 28:49.418
Prototype fried
the starboard switchboards.

28:49.529 --> 28:50.958
Reactor's at one-third.

28:51.749 --> 28:53.581
Vital systems are on auxiliary.

28:53.689 --> 28:55.193
And you can forget
about any nav.

28:55.293 --> 28:56.915
We're trying to reboot, but...

28:57.266 --> 28:59.557
Sam, if you can raise Grace,
get our position.

29:00.090 --> 29:01.057
If we can't get through,

29:01.160 --> 29:02.491
we're gonna have to
wait this one out.

29:02.592 --> 29:04.614
(Kendal) Lieutenant Shepard,
Lieutenant Shepard, come in.

29:04.733 --> 29:06.308
- I'm here, XO.
- Can you get a fix on us?

29:06.421 --> 29:08.782
Not accurately, sir.
There's too much interference.

29:08.966 --> 29:10.812
We're blind down here,
Lieutenant Shepard.

29:12.465 --> 29:13.634
(Static crackles)

29:14.222 --> 29:16.296
Lieutenant Shepard,
are you there? Over.

29:18.166 --> 29:19.167
We lost her.

29:19.277 --> 29:21.045
Sam, it's Sophie.
I know where you are.

29:21.434 --> 29:23.252
Uh, I've got that area charted.

29:24.193 --> 29:25.198
What is that?

29:25.348 --> 29:27.035
You just need to know
how to read it.

29:30.046 --> 29:31.304
I think I can get you out.

29:31.394 --> 29:32.761
Listen carefully.

29:32.901 --> 29:34.371
- What's your depth?
- 175 feet.

29:34.507 --> 29:35.985
- Speed?
- 9 knots.

29:36.096 --> 29:37.595
Do you still have active sonar?

29:38.895 --> 29:40.330
Yeah, we do,
but it's very dangerous.

29:40.479 --> 29:41.662
I know, but do it anyway.

29:44.792 --> 29:46.521
Cameron, one ping
on the fathometer.

29:55.971 --> 29:57.648
(Ping)

29:57.751 --> 29:58.707
Down 50.

29:58.802 --> 30:00.160
Dive to 225.

30:00.253 --> 30:02.141
Yes, sir.
(Whirring)

30:02.231 --> 30:03.747
Okay.

30:04.256 --> 30:05.558
We're at 225.

30:06.172 --> 30:08.091
- Speed?
- 10 knots.

30:09.711 --> 30:11.463
You'll turn soon.
I'll tell you.

30:11.569 --> 30:12.389
Which side?

30:12.487 --> 30:13.822
Starboard. Soon.

30:13.917 --> 30:15.268
Okay.

30:15.784 --> 30:18.203
I think... you may scrape.

30:18.533 --> 30:19.611
Which side? Starboard side?

30:19.705 --> 30:20.977
Yes.

30:22.430 --> 30:23.829
Mark. Turn now--

30:23.913 --> 30:26.112
- 10 degrees.
- Turn 10 degrees starboard side.

30:26.405 --> 30:28.061
(Creaking)

30:32.800 --> 30:34.777
Yeah, that's what
that sounds like.

30:35.343 --> 30:37.113
(Creaking continues)

30:37.206 --> 30:38.697
Almost there.

30:39.676 --> 30:41.507
Dive to 300 feet.

30:42.895 --> 30:44.502
There's a small craft
leaving the island.

30:44.677 --> 30:47.308
(Man) Failing system procedure
bravo 3.2. (Beeping)

30:48.983 --> 30:51.101
It's okay.
I know who it is.

30:51.649 --> 30:52.412
(Stopwatch clicks)

30:52.501 --> 30:53.980
Okay, we're at--
we're at 300 feet.

30:54.219 --> 30:56.277
Level off.
Stay at 90 meters.

30:56.378 --> 30:57.879
I mean, uh, feet.

30:58.012 --> 30:58.810
Uh, 300 feet, sorry.

30:59.143 --> 31:00.696
No, that's okay.
That's fine.

31:04.452 --> 31:05.489
Another ping.

31:05.598 --> 31:06.861
Another ping?
You said "once."

31:06.978 --> 31:08.555
I never said "once."

31:13.051 --> 31:14.626
(Ping)

31:15.448 --> 31:17.271
Turn port 20 degrees.

31:17.368 --> 31:18.594
Okay, there's not much room.

31:18.702 --> 31:20.514
Yeah, this sub doesn't
really corner all that well.

31:20.614 --> 31:22.182
Then we'll have to be careful.

31:22.933 --> 31:24.418
Okay.

31:25.675 --> 31:27.298
You're almost there.

31:31.900 --> 31:34.237
Rise to 120 feet.

31:35.113 --> 31:39.896
And nothing else.
Just, uh... waiting.

31:40.275 --> 31:42.290
That's okay.
I'm used to it.

31:44.933 --> 31:46.942
Me, too.

31:59.198 --> 32:00.455
(Clicks switch) We're clear.

32:00.562 --> 32:01.974
We're on the other side.

32:02.464 --> 32:03.943
(Clicks stopwatch) (Exhales)

32:07.494 --> 32:09.092
- All right, bring us up.
- Aye, sir.

32:09.199 --> 32:10.568
Helm, all ahead flank.

32:10.677 --> 32:13.848
Make your course 1-9-1.
We're headed back to the beach.

32:13.944 --> 32:15.383
Yes, sir.
(Whirring)

32:19.874 --> 32:22.479
(Beeping)

32:31.479 --> 32:33.012
(Rattling)

32:36.572 --> 32:39.623
(Panting) (Grunting)

32:44.366 --> 32:45.666
Your captain reneged
on our deal.

32:45.773 --> 32:46.989
One of you must pay
for his failure.

32:47.082 --> 32:48.385
I will let you choose who.

32:48.459 --> 32:50.036
- Now hold on a second--
- Okay, then you choose!

32:50.139 --> 32:51.621
(Gun cocks) Don't do this!
We had a deal!

32:51.732 --> 32:54.109
- You made a deal?
- I had a deal with your captain.

32:54.220 --> 32:55.054
Quickly,
before I lose patience!

32:55.150 --> 32:57.012
Don't put this on us.
Don't play games.

32:57.106 --> 32:59.679
- Let's talk about this!
- Okay. Then this is how we will talk!

32:59.757 --> 33:00.907
Okay, him!

33:01.972 --> 33:03.482
(Panting)

33:03.611 --> 33:05.017
Take him.

33:08.261 --> 33:10.354
- What? Please!
- I'm s-sorry, Red.

33:10.741 --> 33:12.420
- I'm sorry.
- No! No, no, no!

33:12.528 --> 33:15.855
- I'm sorry, Red.
- Please! Josh! Cortez!

33:16.263 --> 33:17.410
Red, I'm sorry!

33:17.886 --> 33:19.202
Please! Don't do this!

33:20.340 --> 33:21.609
(Gunshot)

33:22.028 --> 33:23.828
(Two gunshots)

33:27.354 --> 33:28.627
(Exhales)

33:31.749 --> 33:33.172
Cortez.

33:33.340 --> 33:34.706
Josh.

33:41.519 --> 33:43.705
(Birds chirping)

33:49.161 --> 33:51.082
(Brakes squeal)

33:54.204 --> 33:55.562
(Parking brake sets)

33:56.171 --> 33:57.564
(Cases clatter)

34:07.916 --> 34:10.120
I could kill you right now.

34:12.306 --> 34:14.601
Do you <i>want</i> a war?

34:16.539 --> 34:19.126
(Case clatters)
(Makes kissing sound)

34:28.233 --> 34:29.994
There's one more!

34:30.678 --> 34:32.367
No, there is not.

34:34.851 --> 34:36.659
You were late.

34:56.388 --> 34:57.777
Let's go.

35:05.982 --> 35:07.799
(Man speaks indistinctly)

35:08.711 --> 35:10.633
(Engines starting)

35:14.195 --> 35:15.843
(Sighs)

35:21.570 --> 35:22.694
(Knock on door)

35:22.877 --> 35:24.653
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:26.946 --> 35:28.340
Have you heard anything?

35:28.504 --> 35:29.741
Uh, no, not yet. They're--

35:30.924 --> 35:32.426
they're doing the switch
right now.

35:32.711 --> 35:33.910
You missed your ride.

35:34.176 --> 35:35.229
(Exhales)

35:35.666 --> 35:37.189
I always pick the wrong ones.

35:37.951 --> 35:39.271
This new year's,
I made a resolution

35:39.376 --> 35:41.957
to give up bad men
and cigarettes,

35:42.071 --> 35:45.242
and a week later I was
smoking in bed next to Guttman.

35:45.342 --> 35:46.441
This is normally
where I'd make a joke

35:46.547 --> 35:48.376
about dating French men, but...

35:48.777 --> 35:49.822
(Both chuckle)

35:50.322 --> 35:51.818
I'll let it go.

35:53.392 --> 35:55.296
We'll find a way
to get you out of here.

35:55.610 --> 35:56.710
You don't have to be
responsible

35:56.843 --> 35:58.421
for everyone, you know?

35:58.535 --> 36:00.246
It's kind of what I do.

36:02.576 --> 36:03.820
Why did you become a soldier?

36:03.920 --> 36:06.182
Well, we're not soldiers.
We're sailors.

36:06.640 --> 36:10.353
But, uh, I was a bit lost
early in life.

36:11.363 --> 36:12.556
The water was more forgiving.

36:12.658 --> 36:15.875
Does your wife-- she also
likes being on the water?

36:19.549 --> 36:21.154
No.

36:21.718 --> 36:22.991
(Exhales)

36:23.536 --> 36:25.049
(Clicks tongue) Uh, look.

36:25.421 --> 36:26.701
I just wanted to come by
and thank you

36:27.779 --> 36:28.812
for what you did.

36:29.183 --> 36:30.200
It seems like every time
I see you

36:30.305 --> 36:31.209
I'm thanking you for something,

36:31.322 --> 36:33.795
but I know you had
a chance to leave, so...

36:35.055 --> 36:36.049
(Chuckles) Thank you.

36:36.158 --> 36:37.618
<i>De rien.</i>

36:37.815 --> 36:39.445
That means "you're welcome."

36:39.563 --> 36:40.563
Okay.

36:40.696 --> 36:43.201
Well, literally it means
"it's nothing."

36:43.772 --> 36:45.215
It wasn't.

36:47.358 --> 36:48.540
Giddyup.

36:56.708 --> 36:58.924
(Men speaking indistinctly)

37:04.695 --> 37:06.164
(Doors closing)

37:07.296 --> 37:08.812
He killed Red?

37:09.811 --> 37:10.574
Yes.

37:10.678 --> 37:11.635
Okay then.

37:12.712 --> 37:13.726
What are you going to do, Sam?

37:14.318 --> 37:16.532
Hold off the entire US Navy
on one side

37:16.644 --> 37:18.306
and fight an insurgency
on the other?

37:18.542 --> 37:20.372
Do not make the mistake
so many others have.

37:20.996 --> 37:24.072
Gunmen in the bushes.
A bomb under every vehicle.

37:24.178 --> 37:26.543
- We'd bleed out in a fight.
- We're bleeding anyway.

37:27.100 --> 37:28.196
What do you think's gonna
happen when they know

37:28.307 --> 37:30.775
we let some island thug
execute one of our own, huh?

37:30.877 --> 37:33.691
- What happens then? - He gave us
a deadline which we did not meet.

37:33.902 --> 37:35.458
We can't keep asking
more of them.

37:35.590 --> 37:37.212
The one thing we have
out here--

37:37.310 --> 37:39.251
the <i>one</i> thing we have out here--
is our loyalty to each other.

37:39.374 --> 37:40.676
That's it!

37:41.199 --> 37:43.003
Now we have to tell them
they don't even have that?

37:43.137 --> 37:45.107
No country, no home,
and now not even the faith

37:45.215 --> 37:46.437
that their death
would mean something?

37:46.557 --> 37:48.076
That we'll just allow them
to be murdered?

37:48.167 --> 37:50.138
My son is lying unburied
in a Navy freezer

37:50.283 --> 37:51.761
as the price
for not capitulating,

37:51.894 --> 37:55.109
so please don't tell <i>me</i>
about faith and vengeance!

37:57.164 --> 37:58.281
We will respond to this affront

37:58.404 --> 38:00.326
at the time and place
of my choosing.

38:04.369 --> 38:06.612
We can't just get stuck here,
Marcus.

38:07.467 --> 38:09.448
(Exhales) Can't do it.

38:09.555 --> 38:11.569
This is not like before, Sam.

38:12.298 --> 38:14.864
We're not helpless here.

38:19.189 --> 38:23.233
The time and place...
of <i>my</i> choosing.

38:35.724 --> 38:38.883
(Door lock and handle clicking)

38:40.946 --> 38:43.038
(Panting)

38:46.821 --> 38:48.535
(Sighs) Dad.

38:49.421 --> 38:50.377
Thank God you're here.

38:50.477 --> 38:52.824
They took it.
They took it all.

38:53.936 --> 38:56.110
Okay. It's okay. It's okay.

39:07.275 --> 39:08.985
What happened in there?

39:09.773 --> 39:11.478
Deadline passed.

39:11.701 --> 39:13.498
Serrat hauled Red out
and shot him.

39:13.619 --> 39:14.995
(Pouring liquor) Red had
been giving him lip earlier,

39:15.108 --> 39:16.888
so I guess he was
an easy target.

39:17.886 --> 39:19.759
I'm sorry you had
to go through that.

39:22.731 --> 39:24.527
We did the best we could.

39:26.406 --> 39:28.149
Forgive me, sir,
but no one blames you

39:28.256 --> 39:29.988
for what happened.

39:30.993 --> 39:32.530
(Exhales)

39:36.388 --> 39:38.002
Maybe you should have
one of those.

39:44.045 --> 39:45.235
(Glass clatters)

39:50.082 --> 39:51.388
