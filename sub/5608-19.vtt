WEBVTT

00:04.261 --> 00:05.794
(elevator bell dings)

00:05.796 --> 00:07.830
Excuse me.

00:07.832 --> 00:09.319
Hey. What do we got?

00:09.320 --> 00:10.687
Hey. Sean Young?

00:10.689 --> 00:12.188
Yeah, the boxer.
Yeah.

00:12.190 --> 00:13.690
He left
The Infatuation Lounge

00:13.692 --> 00:15.158
in the Meatpacking District

00:15.160 --> 00:17.360
with a mystery woman
at about 4:00 a.m.

00:17.362 --> 00:18.628
After the fight?
Yep.

00:18.630 --> 00:20.363
Their car got jacked
at a stoplight.

00:20.365 --> 00:22.765
Perps took his jewelry,
shot him twice.

00:22.767 --> 00:24.233
He was found lying
in the street.

00:24.235 --> 00:26.035
What about the woman?
Gone.

00:26.037 --> 00:27.704
Thinking maybe Young was set up.

00:27.706 --> 00:29.505
Sounds like a setup to me.
Is he likely?

00:29.507 --> 00:30.873
No word yet.

00:30.875 --> 00:32.308
These guys with
their after-parties.

00:32.310 --> 00:34.010
Why don't you just go
to the hotel and take a nap?

00:34.012 --> 00:35.478
He's in stable condition
from the stomach wound.

00:35.480 --> 00:36.979
Still have to operate
on the leg.

00:36.981 --> 00:38.147
Uh, you can talk to him later.

00:38.149 --> 00:39.115
All right. Thanks, Doc.

00:39.117 --> 00:41.150
Hey. Danny Reagan.

00:41.152 --> 00:43.252
Mosley, Brooklyn Robbery Squad.

00:43.254 --> 00:44.620
This is my partner, Maria Baez.

00:44.622 --> 00:46.222
Yeah, we know
each other.

00:46.224 --> 00:47.957
Yes, we do.

00:47.959 --> 00:49.025
Oh.

00:49.027 --> 00:50.359
Okay, well, thanks for
keeping him warm.

00:50.361 --> 00:51.494
We got it from here.

00:51.496 --> 00:53.663
Detective, Sean Young
was shot in Brooklyn,

00:53.665 --> 00:54.897
which makes it my case.

00:54.899 --> 00:56.799
Yeah, but the M.O.
fits the pattern of a crew

00:56.801 --> 00:58.134
that's struck twice
in Manhattan,

00:58.136 --> 00:59.736
so it makes it our case.

00:59.738 --> 01:01.137
Same crew?
Are you sure about that?

01:01.139 --> 01:02.905
DANNY: Three athletes hit
the same way in the same month?

01:02.907 --> 01:04.840
Yeah, I'd say
there's a connection.

01:04.843 --> 01:06.209
They both weren't shot.

01:06.211 --> 01:07.610
That's a fine
distinction.

01:07.612 --> 01:08.911
Not to Sean Young, it isn't.

01:08.913 --> 01:09.946
BAEZ:
Okay, what do you say

01:09.948 --> 01:11.180
we just work
this case together

01:11.182 --> 01:13.149
until the bosses say otherwise?

01:13.151 --> 01:14.917
Sounds good to me.

01:14.919 --> 01:16.185
Sound good to you?

01:16.187 --> 01:18.788
(scoffs)

01:18.790 --> 01:20.423
(sighs)

01:20.425 --> 01:21.791
Whatever.

01:25.463 --> 01:26.763
Thank you.

01:28.233 --> 01:30.233
I always play the same number
for Powerball.

01:30.235 --> 01:32.268
What is it?

01:32.270 --> 01:33.836
If I told you,
it'd jinx it.

01:33.838 --> 01:35.138
Well, have you ever won?

01:35.140 --> 01:36.839
No.

01:36.841 --> 01:38.007
Then how could I jinx it?

01:38.009 --> 01:40.143

Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, folks.
Is there a problem here?

01:52.056 --> 01:53.089
Hey, what's going on?

01:53.091 --> 01:54.323
Someone stole our bags.

01:54.325 --> 01:55.291
Okay, calm down.

01:55.293 --> 01:56.759
Just tell us
exactly what happened.

01:56.761 --> 01:58.628
We were checking into the hotel

01:58.630 --> 02:00.329
and someone
stole them!

02:00.331 --> 02:01.531
Okay, did you get a description?

02:01.533 --> 02:02.598
Did you see them?

02:02.600 --> 02:04.367
No. We turned our backs
for, like, a second

02:04.369 --> 02:05.568
and they were gone.

02:05.570 --> 02:07.537
And what about you, Miss?
Did you see anything?

02:08.606 --> 02:09.705
(sighs)
What is it?

02:09.707 --> 02:11.207
Your passport was in the bag?
Your money?

02:11.209 --> 02:12.742
(sighs) The ring.

02:12.744 --> 02:14.243
What ring?
For my sister's wedding.

02:14.245 --> 02:15.645
I brought it from Oaxaca

02:15.647 --> 02:17.146
for the ceremony.

02:17.148 --> 02:18.481
She trusted me with it!

02:18.483 --> 02:19.982
Don't blame yourself.

02:19.984 --> 02:21.317
Okay, what are you guys' names?

02:21.319 --> 02:23.252
I'm Rosa Alvarez

02:23.254 --> 02:24.253
and this is Maribel Rivas.

02:24.255 --> 02:25.855
JAMIE:
Maribel, listen.

02:25.857 --> 02:27.557
A detective will be assigned
to your case right away.

02:27.559 --> 02:28.891
We're gonna do
everything we can

02:28.893 --> 02:30.293
to get your ring back.

02:30.295 --> 02:32.228
You promise?

02:32.230 --> 02:34.730
I promise we'll do our best.

02:38.303 --> 02:41.170
All right. Copy that.

02:41.172 --> 02:43.004
The limo driver who
picked up Sean Young?

02:43.028 --> 02:43.841
Yeah.

02:43.842 --> 02:45.975
He still hasn't turned up yet,
and neither has his car.

02:45.977 --> 02:47.677
Oh. Maybe he's in on it.

02:47.679 --> 02:50.046
Well, let's check the license
plate readers and E-ZPass,

02:50.048 --> 02:52.381
see if anything pops.
All right.

02:54.252 --> 02:55.451
Do you think
I'm not gonna ask?

02:55.453 --> 02:56.919
What?

02:56.921 --> 02:58.120
Come on, Baez.

02:58.122 --> 02:59.856
We get paid to read people
for a living.

02:59.858 --> 03:01.123
You and Mosley.

03:01.125 --> 03:02.158
Give.

03:02.160 --> 03:04.293
Just give it a rest
for once, Danny.

03:04.295 --> 03:05.895
(elevator bell dings)
I'm just saying...

03:05.897 --> 03:07.263
Come on.

03:07.265 --> 03:08.965
Look.

03:08.967 --> 03:10.600
I know he's the detective
who was married,

03:10.602 --> 03:12.134
from your old squad.

03:12.136 --> 03:14.003
The guy who promised
to leave his wife for you.

03:14.005 --> 03:15.538
It doesn't matter.

03:15.540 --> 03:16.539
It doesn't?

03:16.541 --> 03:18.207
It was a long time ago.

03:18.209 --> 03:19.208
I'm over it.

03:19.210 --> 03:21.310
Okay.

03:21.312 --> 03:22.445
Is that why you've had

03:22.447 --> 03:24.881
so many great
relationships since then?

03:24.883 --> 03:26.215
Because you're so over it?

03:26.217 --> 03:28.284
Just saying,

03:28.286 --> 03:30.486
if you want to sit this one out,
it's no problem.

03:30.488 --> 03:33.189
I'm not getting thrown off
my own case for anyone.

03:33.191 --> 03:35.157
Are you sure?

03:35.159 --> 03:38.694
In case you haven't noticed,
Danny, I'm a big girl.

03:38.696 --> 03:40.596
Okay.

03:40.598 --> 03:41.631
Okay, what's next?

03:41.633 --> 03:42.832
GORMLEY:
And I have the final list

03:42.834 --> 03:45.301
of candidates for the
promotion ceremony next week.

03:45.303 --> 03:46.602
Are you sitting down, boss?

03:48.106 --> 03:49.372
Last time I looked.

03:49.374 --> 03:51.040
Right. We got a situation here.

03:51.042 --> 03:52.475
You gonna tell me?

03:52.477 --> 03:53.542
I'm just warning you.

03:53.544 --> 03:54.710
See for yourself.

04:00.585 --> 04:01.517
Thomas Sculley?

04:01.519 --> 04:02.852
Up for sergeant.

04:02.854 --> 04:04.220
How'd this happen?

04:04.222 --> 04:05.187
Strictly by the book.

04:05.189 --> 04:06.489
He stayed on the job,

04:06.491 --> 04:08.324
kept his head down
all these years.

04:08.326 --> 04:09.759
With this in mind?
All I know

04:09.761 --> 04:11.928
is he passed the exam
with flying colors.

04:11.930 --> 04:14.063
He could jam up
this whole department.

04:14.065 --> 04:15.231
Boss, if I may?

04:15.233 --> 04:17.166
We can't just turn
our backs on him.

04:17.168 --> 04:18.233
What the hell?

04:18.236 --> 04:19.802
We're just getting into it.

04:19.803 --> 04:20.903
I hope that what
you're getting into

04:20.904 --> 04:22.103
is a way to make this disappear.

04:22.106 --> 04:23.306
Now, for good.

04:23.308 --> 04:25.007
Hold on, Garrett.
Hold on for what, Sid?

04:25.009 --> 04:26.275
We just don't
throw him under the bus.

04:26.277 --> 04:27.510
He's a cop.

04:27.512 --> 04:29.078
He's a cop that joined
three other cops

04:29.080 --> 04:30.579
putting 61 rounds

04:30.581 --> 04:32.448
into an unarmed Muslim teenager!

04:32.450 --> 04:35.618
He was acquitted of any crime!
By a jury in Albany!

04:35.620 --> 04:37.653
That's where they held
the trial, where else is he...

04:37.655 --> 04:38.955
Stop!

04:39.924 --> 04:41.624
Please.

04:41.626 --> 04:42.959
I know you're going to want
to do this by the book.

04:42.961 --> 04:44.927
I pray there's some
interpretation of that book...

04:44.929 --> 04:45.895
There's not.

04:45.897 --> 04:46.929
...that prevents Thomas Sculley

04:46.931 --> 04:48.164
from being raised up
in this department.

04:48.166 --> 04:49.465
There isn't.
I already checked.

04:49.467 --> 04:50.866
Then you're gonna
let me find a way.

04:50.868 --> 04:52.435
Is that an offer or a threat?
Call it what you want.

04:52.437 --> 04:55.104
Frank, please tell me you're
looking out ahead of this.

04:55.106 --> 04:57.707
(sighs)

04:57.709 --> 04:58.908
I'm trying.

'Cause in this climate--

05:00.078 --> 05:01.444
in any climate in this city--

05:01.446 --> 05:03.145
rewarding this guy
with a rise-up in rank

05:03.147 --> 05:04.313
is gonna undo

05:04.315 --> 05:06.182
years of outreach

That detective is too busy.

06:14.683 --> 06:15.949
He's not gonna help us.

06:15.951 --> 06:17.550
Investigations take time.

06:17.552 --> 06:19.252
And it's not his only case.

06:19.254 --> 06:21.388
And who cares about
a couple of Mexican girls

06:21.390 --> 06:23.256
who are gonna be gone
in a week anyway?

06:23.258 --> 06:24.891
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
it's-it's not that.

06:24.893 --> 06:26.793
Oh, really?
Then what's it like?

06:26.795 --> 06:29.596
Maribel is in
a really bad situation.

06:29.598 --> 06:30.931
Just please, please understand.

06:30.933 --> 06:33.833
I haven't even told my family
the ring is missing yet.

06:33.835 --> 06:35.135
It'll be very

06:35.137 --> 06:36.703
difficult for them.

06:36.705 --> 06:38.071
It's an heirloom;

06:38.073 --> 06:39.372
the most valuable
thing they own.

06:39.374 --> 06:40.674
It was made
by Emmanuel Peralta,

06:40.676 --> 06:44.477
a very famous silversmith
in Oaxaca.

06:44.479 --> 06:46.413
There were times
when we almost sold it,

06:46.415 --> 06:47.414
but we passed it down instead.

06:47.416 --> 06:48.448
It's our history,

06:48.450 --> 06:49.849
our pride.

06:49.851 --> 06:52.185
My sister's wedding
is in four days.

06:52.187 --> 06:54.354
I have to get it back!

06:54.356 --> 06:57.757
Just sit tight and
we'll look into it. Okay?

06:57.759 --> 07:00.694
Thank you, officer.

07:01.730 --> 07:03.063
I appreciate it.

07:03.065 --> 07:05.065
You got it.

07:09.638 --> 07:11.071
Did you want to pick
your jaw up off the ground?

07:11.073 --> 07:12.939
Or...
Shut up, Janko.

07:12.941 --> 07:14.641
I don't blame you.
I mean, she's gorgeous.

07:14.643 --> 07:15.842
What does that matter?

07:15.844 --> 07:18.111
Admit it, you want to be
her knight in shining armor.

07:18.113 --> 07:20.947
Hey, listen, even if
I was interested-- if--

07:20.949 --> 07:22.615
it's against department policy.

07:22.617 --> 07:24.017
Because we go out,
something goes wrong,

07:24.019 --> 07:25.485
she could sue
the whole department.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.487
But she's only in town for a few
days and then she goes home.

07:27.489 --> 07:28.888
To another country.

07:28.890 --> 07:30.690
Jamie, you could loosen up.
Go for it.

07:30.692 --> 07:32.292
What are you,
my wingman all the sudden?

07:32.294 --> 07:34.327
No, I'm just looking out
for your best interests.

07:34.329 --> 07:35.829
I don't think it's
in my best interest

07:35.831 --> 07:37.564
to go hooking up
with complainants.

07:37.566 --> 07:40.033
Then why did <i>you</i> promise
that you would help her?

07:40.035 --> 07:41.735
Because Rosa is right.

07:41.737 --> 07:43.870
Imagine what it feels like
to come here from Mexico.

07:43.872 --> 07:46.006
People talking about building
a wall to keep you out.

07:46.008 --> 07:48.041
Let's show 'em that
this is New York City.

07:48.043 --> 07:50.243
Everybody's welcome.

07:54.082 --> 07:55.115
Hey.

07:55.117 --> 07:56.116
Light and sweet.

07:56.118 --> 07:57.684
It's not gonna work
this way, Jimmy.

07:57.686 --> 07:58.651
What way?

07:58.653 --> 08:00.653
It's just good
to see you.

08:00.655 --> 08:01.855
Notice anything?

08:01.857 --> 08:04.324
You never wore it anyway,
so what does it matter?

08:04.326 --> 08:05.358
Come on.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.494
Just... one drink.

08:07.496 --> 08:10.063
Just... just one drink tonight.

08:10.065 --> 08:11.364
Let's talk.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.366
A lot's gone down.

08:13.368 --> 08:16.569
Been there, done that,
lost the T-shirt.

08:16.571 --> 08:17.804
One drink.

08:19.474 --> 08:20.707
It's nothing?

08:20.709 --> 08:22.675
You don't,
you don't feel nothing?

08:28.216 --> 08:29.149
Baez, Mosley!

08:29.151 --> 08:31.317
Sorry to interrupt.

08:33.889 --> 08:35.655
I think I got something here.

08:35.657 --> 08:38.024
CCTV footage
from outside the club.

08:38.025 --> 08:38.957
That's Young.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.527
DANNY:
Yeah, exactly.

08:40.529 --> 08:41.794
Who is she?

08:41.797 --> 08:43.029
Well, that's
the million-dollar question.

08:43.030 --> 08:44.798
Who is she?

08:44.800 --> 08:46.466
Well, it's a bad angle.
You can't see her face.

08:46.468 --> 08:47.901
Yeah, but look at
her body language.

08:47.903 --> 08:50.003
It's almost as if she knew
there was a camera there.

08:50.005 --> 08:51.438
She's sort of hiding herself.

08:51.440 --> 08:53.807
Where are the women
who left with the other vics?

08:53.809 --> 08:55.842
Right here in the file.
Take a look.

08:55.844 --> 08:58.745
Meanwhile, I'm gonna
zoom in on her.

09:04.986 --> 09:06.186
What is this on her ear?

09:06.188 --> 09:07.220
The earring up there?

09:07.222 --> 09:08.855
What do they call that?

09:08.857 --> 09:11.291
It's a cartilage piercing.

09:11.293 --> 09:13.159
Cartilage piercing...

09:13.161 --> 09:15.628
The woman in the hat
has the same one.

09:20.502 --> 09:22.469
Son of a bitch.

09:22.471 --> 09:24.404
She's hiding her face.
Same physical type.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.309
I think they're all
the same woman.

09:29.311 --> 09:31.177
The honey trap
that lures the mark.

09:31.179 --> 09:33.880
I say if we find her,
we find the crew who did this.

09:33.882 --> 09:36.149
Still think it's unconnected?

09:37.385 --> 09:38.985
It's good.

09:38.987 --> 09:40.153
It's good work.

09:43.058 --> 09:45.425
Do you mind?
We got work to do.

09:45.427 --> 09:46.693
What?

09:50.832 --> 09:52.031
Champ.

09:52.033 --> 09:53.933
Detective Reagan.
This is Detective...

09:53.935 --> 09:55.668
Mosley.
Mosley.

09:55.670 --> 09:57.470
How you holding up, champ?

09:57.472 --> 10:00.006
I might've been better off going
another 12 rounds instead.

10:00.008 --> 10:02.142
Yeah, you got that right.

10:02.144 --> 10:03.076
I don't got much.

10:03.078 --> 10:04.477
Well, just be
straight with us.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.846
We'll be the judge
of what you got.

10:06.848 --> 10:08.781
We heard from some witnesses

10:08.783 --> 10:10.016
that there was
a beef at the club

10:10.018 --> 10:11.384
between you and some guys.

10:11.386 --> 10:13.486
Do you think they might have
been involved in the shooting?

10:13.488 --> 10:14.787
Nah, no.
That was nothing.

10:14.789 --> 10:17.090
I mean, when you're a fighter,

10:17.092 --> 10:18.558
dudes are always
stepping to you,

10:18.560 --> 10:20.226
trying to prove they tough.

10:20.228 --> 10:22.228
Any other beefs?
Uh, gang affiliations?

10:22.230 --> 10:23.696
I'm from Atlanta.

10:23.698 --> 10:24.764
I don't know a soul here.

10:24.766 --> 10:26.699
I never been in a gang.

10:26.701 --> 10:28.368
It was that girl.

10:28.370 --> 10:30.236
That girl--
she set me up.

10:31.406 --> 10:32.739
Had to have been.

10:33.909 --> 10:35.375
Is this her?

10:35.377 --> 10:36.409
Yeah.

10:36.411 --> 10:38.378
Yeah, that's the one

10:38.380 --> 10:39.679
I got in the car with, yeah.

10:39.681 --> 10:40.980
Did you get her name?

10:40.982 --> 10:42.882
Nah, man, I was just
calling her boo.

10:42.884 --> 10:44.651
“Boo”?
Yeah, boo.

10:44.653 --> 10:48.354
I didn't exactly ask for I.D.,
you know what I'm saying?

10:48.356 --> 10:49.622
Uh-huh. How about the driver?

10:49.624 --> 10:51.758
You think the driver
could have been involved?

10:51.760 --> 10:54.427
Uh, to be honest,
I didn't even notice him.

10:54.429 --> 10:56.729
He was just kind of supplied,
you know?

10:56.731 --> 10:58.198
Why'd you stop?

10:58.200 --> 11:00.533
One SUV boxed us in
from the front,

11:00.535 --> 11:01.601
another from the back.

11:01.603 --> 11:02.735
There was just, like,

11:02.737 --> 11:04.137
six dudes, I think.

11:04.139 --> 11:05.972
You get a look at 'em?
Nah, they were dressed

11:05.974 --> 11:08.208
in all black and had masks
over their faces

11:08.210 --> 11:09.776
and then went right
for my ice, too.

11:09.778 --> 11:11.911
About 200K worth.

11:11.913 --> 11:13.713
My watch another hundred.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.682
Hear anything? Accents?

11:15.684 --> 11:17.183
Call each other nicknames?

11:17.185 --> 11:18.518
Nah, they were
quick and quiet.

11:18.520 --> 11:20.386
But the guy that
shot me was huge.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.255
Yeah, that's what
I noticed.

11:22.257 --> 11:23.890
I was just staring at the gun.

11:23.892 --> 11:26.192
Why do you think he shot you?
You resist?

11:26.194 --> 11:28.194
No, no, I-I gave it right up.

11:28.196 --> 11:29.862
But he shot me anyway.

11:29.864 --> 11:31.898
His eyes were
totally blank.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.100
Thought I was dead.

11:34.102 --> 11:35.368
What's wrong

11:35.370 --> 11:36.436
with these people?

11:36.438 --> 11:38.738
We ask ourselves
those questions every day.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.206
BAEZ:
Hey, guys?

11:41.443 --> 11:43.776
Excuse us.

11:43.778 --> 11:45.812
Yeah.

11:45.814 --> 11:46.846
A Vigilant camera

11:46.848 --> 11:48.948
got a hit
on the missing limo's plates.

11:48.950 --> 11:50.650
Where?

11:50.652 --> 11:52.151
It was headed to a parking
garage in Bed-Stuy.

11:52.153 --> 11:53.686
Somebody called in
about the garage,

11:53.688 --> 11:55.622
said it'd been locked all day,
no one could get to their cars.

11:55.624 --> 11:57.724
Anyone been in touch
with the owner?

11:57.726 --> 11:59.158
He's gonna meet us there.

11:59.160 --> 12:00.760
Let's go.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.867
(door opens)
BAKER: Commissioner.

12:07.869 --> 12:10.603
Union President Grant
and Officer Sculley are here.

12:10.605 --> 12:13.139
Thank you, Baker.

12:14.509 --> 12:15.708
FRANK:
Morning, Randy.

12:15.710 --> 12:16.976
Commissioner.

12:16.978 --> 12:19.812
Thanks for coming,
Officer Sculley.

12:19.814 --> 12:22.081
Soon-to-be Sergeant Sculley.
Easy, there, Randy.

12:22.083 --> 12:23.916
That's what we're
here to discuss.

12:23.918 --> 12:25.752
Not sure what there
is to discuss.

12:25.754 --> 12:28.755
Well, let me try
and enlighten you.

12:28.757 --> 12:31.491
And forgive me, Officer Sculley,
but I'm going to be blunt.

12:31.493 --> 12:33.159
Please.

12:34.262 --> 12:35.595
Of course.

12:36.665 --> 12:38.164
The other
three officers

12:38.166 --> 12:42.535
in the Mohammed Sadiq shooting
resigned after the trial.

12:42.537 --> 12:44.203
They knew there was
no coming back,

12:44.205 --> 12:47.173
and if I had been
commissioner back then,

12:47.175 --> 12:49.809
I would have made sure
you followed suit.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.711
But you weren't commissioner,
and Officer Sculley

12:51.713 --> 12:53.413
was acquitted
in a criminal trial

12:53.415 --> 12:54.614
and cleared of any
departmental charges

12:54.616 --> 12:57.483
by then-Police
Commissioner Connors.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.152
He was then free
to resume his career...

12:59.154 --> 13:00.787
FRANK:
Which he has done,

13:00.789 --> 13:03.489
and I haven't
interfered with it.

13:03.491 --> 13:04.657
But a promotion

13:04.659 --> 13:08.027
would pour salt
in a lot of old wounds.

13:08.029 --> 13:09.929
GRANT: So what do you
want him to do?

13:09.931 --> 13:11.397
Renounce it?

13:11.399 --> 13:12.832
I didn't say that.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.100
Commissioner,

13:14.102 --> 13:15.268
if-if I may.

13:15.270 --> 13:17.270
Please.

13:17.272 --> 13:20.573
Look, I know people thought
I was crazy to stay on the job.

13:20.575 --> 13:23.009
But I actually did it
for Mohammed Sadiq.

13:23.011 --> 13:25.078
I wanted to do the job right...

13:27.482 --> 13:30.149
...to honor his memory
with my service.

13:30.151 --> 13:32.485
Well...

13:32.487 --> 13:34.487
that's admirable.

13:34.489 --> 13:37.690
But an awful lot
of people that...

13:37.692 --> 13:40.827
It's just gonna
go right over their heads.

13:40.829 --> 13:42.061
Including you.

13:42.063 --> 13:43.629
I'm on your side.

13:43.631 --> 13:44.964
You're judging me
by this one mistake.

13:44.966 --> 13:46.466
Yes, a mistake
he made

13:46.468 --> 13:48.334
when he was 24 years old.

13:48.336 --> 13:50.837
Some mistakes time erases,
some it does not.

13:50.839 --> 13:52.004
I've been trying

13:52.006 --> 13:54.640
to atone for the last 14 years.

13:54.642 --> 13:58.511
And effort
does not guarantee outcome.

13:58.513 --> 14:01.080
You don't get to decide
what the penance is

14:01.082 --> 14:03.182
and when it's done.

14:03.184 --> 14:06.452
Would you like to take a poll
of minority communities

14:06.454 --> 14:07.754
about your promotion?

14:07.756 --> 14:10.390
What, are you managing
by hypothetical polls now?

14:10.392 --> 14:12.892
I've got an ear to the ground,
Randy. That's part of my job.

14:12.894 --> 14:15.762
All due respect, Commissioner,
but this is a non-conversation.

14:15.764 --> 14:18.097
Thomas Sculley
earned this promotion,

14:18.099 --> 14:20.700
and unless you want to change
every departmental guideline,

14:20.702 --> 14:22.235
there are no grounds
for you to block it.

14:22.237 --> 14:23.803
I didn't say anything
about blocking it.

14:23.805 --> 14:26.105
The man's a hero,

14:26.107 --> 14:28.141
in my book.

14:30.979 --> 14:32.812
A hero?

14:34.716 --> 14:37.550
He helped turn an unarmed
young man into Swiss cheese,

14:37.552 --> 14:41.120
finagled to keep his job
at full pay,

14:41.122 --> 14:42.422
and now wants a promotion.

14:42.424 --> 14:43.990
What part of that says hero?

14:43.992 --> 14:47.026
Commissioner, look,
I'm not saying that I'm a hero.

14:47.028 --> 14:48.728
But...

14:48.730 --> 14:52.265
I can hold my head up high
in this city.

14:52.267 --> 14:53.433
Perseverance, Frank.

14:53.435 --> 14:55.234
Perseverance.

14:55.236 --> 14:57.236
Under conditions caused
by his own mistakes?

14:57.238 --> 14:59.238
That's called life, Randy.

14:59.240 --> 15:02.108
(sighs)

15:02.110 --> 15:03.876
We're done here.

15:03.878 --> 15:06.045
With what result?

15:06.047 --> 15:09.949
With the result that I'm
asking you to leave now.

15:16.257 --> 15:18.591
(door opens, closes)

15:18.593 --> 15:20.760
(sighs)

15:26.601 --> 15:28.768
This never happens,
Detectives.

15:28.770 --> 15:30.770
Carl Scott's worked
for me for five years.

15:30.772 --> 15:32.338
He's like clockwork.

15:32.340 --> 15:33.673
Carl.

15:33.675 --> 15:34.774
Carl.

15:34.776 --> 15:36.275
Hold on.
Is that the office?

15:36.277 --> 15:38.010
Yeah.
I'm gonna look for the limo.

15:38.012 --> 15:40.213
All right.

15:40.215 --> 15:41.814
This locked?

15:41.816 --> 15:43.382
No.

15:49.390 --> 15:50.790
Son of a bitch.

15:50.792 --> 15:52.692
That's him. That's Carl.

15:52.694 --> 15:54.227
All right.
Oh, my God.

15:54.229 --> 15:56.095
All right, you--
step outside, okay?

15:56.097 --> 15:58.331
Step outside.
Hey, come here.

15:58.333 --> 15:59.665
We got a crime scene here,
okay? Lock it down.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.667
Don't let him go anywhere.
JIMMY: Over here!

16:08.810 --> 16:10.409
What do you got?

16:10.411 --> 16:12.678
Got blood on the steering wheel.

16:14.249 --> 16:16.315
Definitely a print.

16:18.553 --> 16:20.820
Oh, boy.

16:25.460 --> 16:26.759
Son of a bitch.

16:26.761 --> 16:28.060
You find something?

16:28.062 --> 16:29.529
Yeah, the driver.

16:34.102 --> 16:35.968
So much for witnesses.

16:35.970 --> 16:37.537
Yeah.

16:58.153 --> 16:59.653
That was my final answer.

16:59.655 --> 17:02.322
Please don't bring it up again.

17:02.324 --> 17:03.557
Please don't
shut me down on this.

17:03.559 --> 17:06.026
My opinion is valid
and valuable.

17:06.028 --> 17:07.794
I didn't say it wasn't.

17:07.796 --> 17:09.796
In effect, you did.
Look, Pop, I agree.

17:09.798 --> 17:13.266
I inherited the Sculley problem
from Commissioner Connors.

17:13.268 --> 17:15.669
Don't use the honorarium to me.

17:15.671 --> 17:18.704
He goes by Crooked Connors,
as far as I'm concerned.

17:18.707 --> 17:20.073
Okay, but Connors served his...

17:20.075 --> 17:21.141
Crooked Conners.

17:21.143 --> 17:23.676
Whatever.
He served his time in prison,

17:23.679 --> 17:25.444
he's disappeared
from the scene

17:25.446 --> 17:28.147
and any conversation
for about the past decade.

17:28.150 --> 17:30.350
So it's a card you can play.

17:30.352 --> 17:33.353
If I did it would read
like exactly what it is--

17:33.355 --> 17:34.521
I'm passing the buck.

17:34.523 --> 17:36.122
But it's his buck.

17:36.124 --> 17:37.257
If I bought a house

17:37.259 --> 17:39.426
and the water heater exploded
years later,

17:39.428 --> 17:41.194
should I blame
the previous owner?

17:41.196 --> 17:43.797
Come on, Francis.
This isn't the water heater.

17:43.799 --> 17:46.066
This is a corpse
buried in the cellar.

17:46.068 --> 17:47.934
Well, I'm not
dragging Conners into this.

17:47.936 --> 17:49.903
As much as I'd like to.

17:49.905 --> 17:51.471
Now you're
just being pigheaded.

17:51.473 --> 17:53.340
And now you're sounding
like Garrett.

17:53.342 --> 17:56.042
Even a broken clock
is right twice a day.

17:56.044 --> 17:58.144
What's that mean?
It means that

17:58.146 --> 18:00.280
you use Garrett
as a reverse barometer,

18:00.282 --> 18:03.083
and sometimes you should
just take his advice.

18:03.085 --> 18:05.585
It's a police matter.
It is my job.

18:05.587 --> 18:08.188
It's also a political
stick of dynamite.

18:08.190 --> 18:10.290
There is nothing
in the Patrol Guide

18:10.292 --> 18:12.492
about how to handle this.

18:12.494 --> 18:13.827
(sighs)

18:13.829 --> 18:16.763
I like to think
I stand for cops.

18:16.765 --> 18:19.666
I give one cop up in sacrifice,

18:19.668 --> 18:21.868
I've given up all of them.

18:26.275 --> 18:28.174
(bell dings)

18:28.176 --> 18:29.743
Jimmy's got a contact
in Latents.

18:29.745 --> 18:31.011
They're rushing those prints
for him.

18:31.013 --> 18:32.045
He's gonna meet us here.

18:32.047 --> 18:33.847
Good. When'd he call it in?

18:33.849 --> 18:36.416
It wasn't a call.
He told me last night.

18:37.753 --> 18:39.019
You were with him last night?

18:39.021 --> 18:40.854
We had dinner.

18:40.856 --> 18:42.589
Oh.

18:42.591 --> 18:44.524
You got a problem with that?

18:44.526 --> 18:47.193
No. Nope.

18:48.530 --> 18:50.430
How was it?

18:50.432 --> 18:52.666
Just burgers.
Mm.

18:52.668 --> 18:54.467
I wasn't talking about the food.

18:54.469 --> 18:56.102
Yeah, I know you weren't.

18:56.104 --> 18:59.239
So...
So, how much you want to know?

18:59.241 --> 19:01.107
How much do you want to tell me?

19:02.811 --> 19:05.245
I think I might've
been in love with him.

19:05.247 --> 19:08.014
I think that's something
that you don't think,

19:08.016 --> 19:10.250
that's something
you usually know.

19:10.252 --> 19:12.452
Not if the guy's married.

19:13.455 --> 19:14.688
How's that?

19:14.690 --> 19:16.256
It's like a particular

19:16.258 --> 19:18.591
kind of bulletproof vest
you wear, if the guy's married.

19:18.593 --> 19:20.894
So certain things can't get in.

19:20.896 --> 19:23.630
Hmm. Like?

19:23.632 --> 19:26.366
Some ideas of romantic love.

19:26.368 --> 19:28.101
What a real relationship

19:28.103 --> 19:30.070
in broad daylight
would be like.

19:30.072 --> 19:32.706
(sighs)
What's in that for you?

19:32.708 --> 19:34.607
(sighs)

19:34.609 --> 19:36.609
Lots.

19:36.611 --> 19:38.645
The sex.

19:38.647 --> 19:40.580
The thrill of living

19:40.582 --> 19:42.749
in the secret little world
together.

19:42.751 --> 19:44.751
Okay. And now?

19:44.753 --> 19:46.186
And now...

19:46.188 --> 19:48.688
he's divorced, and I'm single,

19:48.690 --> 19:51.091
and we have
maybe this one chance

19:51.093 --> 19:54.828
to see if it works out
in the world.

19:54.830 --> 19:57.597
So, how was dinner?

19:58.467 --> 19:59.833
It was really good.

19:59.835 --> 20:01.634
And we're not
talking about the food.

20:01.636 --> 20:04.037
No.
Okay.

20:04.039 --> 20:05.605
And you don't think
you need to wear the vest?

20:05.607 --> 20:08.208
No.
Well, not for nothing,

20:08.210 --> 20:10.610
but if it was me, and I got
an arrow through my heart,

20:10.612 --> 20:12.278
I would definitely
wear the vest.

20:12.280 --> 20:14.381
Yeah, I know, but... you can't.

20:14.383 --> 20:15.749
Why not?

20:15.751 --> 20:18.051
Well, otherwise
you're never gonna let him in

20:18.053 --> 20:20.253
and find out what's what.

20:20.255 --> 20:21.855
I guess.

20:21.857 --> 20:23.356
Speak of the devil.

20:24.659 --> 20:26.192
Hey partners.
Hey Jimmy.

20:26.194 --> 20:27.694
We got a match
on the print

20:27.696 --> 20:29.195
from the limo.

20:29.197 --> 20:31.197
Meet John Bell,

20:31.199 --> 20:32.899
chronic felon.
Armed robbery,

20:32.901 --> 20:35.602
home invasion. Him and his crew
have been at this for a while.

20:35.604 --> 20:38.638
Robbing the rich and famous--
that's the new twist.

20:38.640 --> 20:40.006
Six-three, 290.

20:40.008 --> 20:41.875
Fits the description Young gave.

20:41.877 --> 20:43.109
That's our shooter.

20:43.111 --> 20:44.310
We have a last known?

20:44.312 --> 20:46.646
Over the bridge.
Backup's gonna meet us there.

20:46.648 --> 20:49.582
Okay.
Does everyone have their vests?

20:49.584 --> 20:50.984
Always.

20:53.155 --> 20:56.523
Good. What are we waiting for?

21:00.962 --> 21:03.897
(indistinct conversation)

21:03.899 --> 21:06.065
What's the matter?

21:09.104 --> 21:11.271
Hey, Dom.

21:11.273 --> 21:13.039
Where'd your friend go?

21:13.041 --> 21:15.041
Went to take a leak.

21:15.043 --> 21:16.643
Is there a law against that?

21:16.645 --> 21:18.211
No, there's no law
against that.

21:18.213 --> 21:20.647
There is a law
against snatching some bags

21:20.649 --> 21:22.382
outside of the Wessex Hotel.

21:22.384 --> 21:24.284
Snatching some what?

21:24.286 --> 21:25.852
What are you guys talking about?

21:25.854 --> 21:27.220
Look, I'm getting
sick of this.

21:27.222 --> 21:29.022
You know,
a kid robs a candy bar

21:29.024 --> 21:30.757
from a bodega,
and you guys bracing me?

21:30.759 --> 21:32.992
I mean, I feel like
I'm the only white guy

21:32.994 --> 21:34.427
in this city
that's getting profiled!

21:34.429 --> 21:36.696
We can talk about it here,
or we can bring you in.

21:36.698 --> 21:38.498
DOM: Come on, you both
know that I didn't do

21:38.500 --> 21:39.666
no snatch-and-run at some hotel.

21:39.668 --> 21:40.834
That's ridiculous.

21:40.836 --> 21:42.335
Inside one of the bags
was a ring.

21:42.337 --> 21:43.837
Have you ever heard
of an Emmanuel Peralta?

21:43.839 --> 21:45.397
Yeah, Mexican silver,
turn of the century.

21:45.398 --> 21:47.975
If you stole something like that,
where would you fence it?

21:47.976 --> 21:50.210
Hey,

21:50.212 --> 21:51.878
that was Donnie Price,
known felon, okay?

21:51.880 --> 21:54.347
Consorting with him is enough
to get you violating parole.

21:54.349 --> 21:57.383
Look, there's one person
that knows something about that,

21:57.385 --> 21:59.219
but if I tell you,

21:59.221 --> 22:00.553
then I could get
jammed up.

22:00.555 --> 22:02.455
How are they gonna know
it was you?

22:02.457 --> 22:04.557
Look,

22:04.559 --> 22:06.926
help us out,
we'll leave you alone.

22:06.928 --> 22:08.595
We'll even owe you a favor.

22:08.597 --> 22:10.530
It's balls. It's garbage.

22:10.532 --> 22:12.398
You guys are bunch of liars...

22:12.400 --> 22:15.502
We can lie about it
all the way to central booking.

22:16.538 --> 22:19.439
I guess I don't have a choice,
do I?

22:24.145 --> 22:26.279
(tires squealing)

22:28.850 --> 22:30.316
What's going on?

22:30.318 --> 22:32.652
We're here for John Bell.
Could you get him?

22:32.654 --> 22:35.054
Why? What'd he do?
Could you just get him, please?

22:35.056 --> 22:37.790
Mommy, are we in trouble?

22:37.792 --> 22:39.392
Hush. Everything's fine.

22:39.394 --> 22:40.894
He's not here.

22:40.896 --> 22:43.029
Hasn't been here for
six months. Haven't even

22:43.031 --> 22:45.331
spoken to him. I don't know why
he used this address.

22:45.333 --> 22:46.366
You mind if we check?

22:46.368 --> 22:47.534
Go ahead.

22:47.536 --> 22:48.968
I got nothing to hide.

22:48.970 --> 22:50.904
Thanks.

22:50.906 --> 22:52.739
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

22:52.741 --> 22:54.207
Last I heard, he was bouncing

22:54.209 --> 22:56.342
at a club in the city--
The Infatuation Lounge.

22:56.344 --> 22:58.044
He met some
skank there.

22:58.046 --> 22:59.812
That's who he left me for.

22:59.814 --> 23:02.115
Do you know her name?
She works there, too?

23:02.117 --> 23:05.018
No idea.
Just smelled her on him.

23:05.020 --> 23:06.352
John did those
robberies,

23:06.354 --> 23:08.555
didn't he?
From the papers?

23:08.557 --> 23:10.256
What makes you say that?
He used to rob

23:10.258 --> 23:11.624
drug dealers back in the day.

23:11.626 --> 23:13.159
Used a front
girl then, too.

23:13.161 --> 23:14.460
Girl would lure the dude
somewhere,

23:14.462 --> 23:15.929
John and his boys
would be waiting.

23:15.931 --> 23:17.931
Gun to the head, torture 'em,
whatever it took

23:17.933 --> 23:19.899
to get to their stash and cash.
Ruthless.

23:19.901 --> 23:21.734
Were you ever that girl, Denise?

23:21.736 --> 23:25.071
No. Never had the stomach
for it.

23:25.073 --> 23:26.806
All clear.

23:26.808 --> 23:28.107
BAEZ:
John calls

23:28.109 --> 23:29.609
or comes back,
you let us know.

23:29.611 --> 23:32.011
No. He won't.

23:45.671 --> 23:47.171
SEAN:
<i>Did anybody</i>

23:47.173 --> 23:48.939
in our family come
through Ellis Island?

23:48.941 --> 23:50.341
Sean's doing
an immigration project

23:50.343 --> 23:52.042
for school.

23:52.044 --> 23:52.877
I can speak for myself, Mom.

23:52.879 --> 23:54.245
Hey, she knows that.

23:54.247 --> 23:56.480
LINDA:
I'm sorry, Sean.

23:56.482 --> 23:57.581
Go ahead.

23:57.583 --> 23:59.250
I have to fill out this...

23:59.252 --> 24:00.651
questionnaire full of...

24:00.653 --> 24:04.088
Questions?
Yeah.

24:04.090 --> 24:05.623
I had to do something
like that.

24:05.625 --> 24:07.792
I should see if I could still
find it, save you the trouble.

24:07.794 --> 24:09.326
Nicky.
Mom, I'm kidding.

24:09.328 --> 24:10.628
FRANK:
Well,

24:10.630 --> 24:12.029
since you did do one, Nicky,

24:12.031 --> 24:14.565
at least tell Sean
how we got over here.

24:14.567 --> 24:16.233
Well, if I remember right,

24:16.235 --> 24:18.135
I think we kind of snuck in.

24:18.137 --> 24:19.570
(laughs)

24:19.572 --> 24:21.505
No, we did not sneak in.

24:21.507 --> 24:24.041
Your great-great
grandfather, my dad,

24:24.043 --> 24:26.143
tried to get
through Ellis Island twice,

24:26.145 --> 24:28.512
but they sent him back
to Ireland twice because of

24:28.514 --> 24:31.048
an eye condition
called trachoma.

24:31.050 --> 24:34.251
He finally slipped in
through the Port of New York.

24:34.253 --> 24:35.886
Yeah. Slipped in, snuck in,
what's the diff?

24:35.888 --> 24:37.087
FRANK:
The diff is,

24:37.089 --> 24:38.856
he came here legally.

24:38.858 --> 24:40.691
He just wanted
to avoid Ellis Island

24:40.693 --> 24:43.461
because by then,
they had an eye out for him.

24:43.463 --> 24:45.095
No pun intended.

24:45.097 --> 24:46.297
DANNY: Yeah,
he must have really

24:46.299 --> 24:47.965
wanted to come to America.

24:47.967 --> 24:49.266
Well, like millions of others,

24:49.268 --> 24:52.002
he'd heard that the streets
were paved with gold.

24:52.004 --> 24:54.071
But he found out
that they weren't paved at all,

24:54.073 --> 24:56.340
and he was expected
to pave 'em.

24:56.342 --> 24:57.808
Still happens, too.
Just not to the Irish.

24:57.810 --> 25:00.010
Are there any traditions
that we still do today?

25:00.012 --> 25:01.612
Well, as a matter of fact...

25:01.614 --> 25:02.746
We still like our drink.

25:02.748 --> 25:04.181
Hear! Hear!
(laughter)

25:04.183 --> 25:05.449
It's for school.

25:05.451 --> 25:07.284
HENRY: As a matter of fact,
we're practicing

25:07.286 --> 25:09.687
a tradition right now--
having Sunday dinners together.

25:09.689 --> 25:11.522
My father used to say
that he needed

25:11.524 --> 25:14.124
to look into the eyes
of all those he loved

25:14.126 --> 25:17.328
at least once a week
so that he could cut off

25:17.330 --> 25:19.163
any real trouble at the pass.

25:19.165 --> 25:20.598
And what do you see
when you look around

25:20.600 --> 25:21.732
the table at this bunch?

25:21.734 --> 25:23.445
Trouble. Nothing but trouble.

25:23.445 --> 25:24.668
(laughter)

25:24.692 --> 25:26.137
JACK: What did you mean
when you said

25:26.138 --> 25:28.305
it still happens,
just not to the Irish?

25:28.307 --> 25:32.810
Just the promise of New York,
of America, of streets paved

25:32.812 --> 25:33.978
with gold or whatever.

25:33.980 --> 25:35.312
It's not as simple
as jumping off the boat

25:35.314 --> 25:36.580
into open arms.
NICKY: Well, what about

25:36.582 --> 25:38.516
what it says
on the Statue of Liberty?

25:38.518 --> 25:39.984
FRANK:
Well, that's the promise,

25:39.986 --> 25:42.386
but each tribe has had
to earn their place here.

25:42.388 --> 25:45.322
And historically, they make it
tough for the tribes

25:45.324 --> 25:48.325
that come after,
just to keep it fair.

25:48.327 --> 25:49.827
How is that fair?

25:49.829 --> 25:53.631
Well, fair to themselves,
which, in the end,

25:53.633 --> 25:55.933
is how most people define fair.

25:59.872 --> 26:02.406
(buzzer sounds on TV)
MAN (on TV): That's the end of the first.

26:02.408 --> 26:05.242
Rangers trail three, one.
Well...

26:05.244 --> 26:06.777
That was ugly.

26:06.779 --> 26:08.646
Maybe we should order
some coffee

26:08.648 --> 26:09.947
down to their locker room.

26:09.949 --> 26:11.815
(chuckles)

26:13.686 --> 26:15.986
My two cents, Tom Sculley?

26:17.690 --> 26:19.456
I warn you, I got a bankroll

26:19.458 --> 26:21.659
from all the two cents
on that one.

26:21.661 --> 26:23.694
I'll bet you do.

26:23.696 --> 26:25.362
Shoot.

26:25.364 --> 26:27.731
Did you know that he came
and talked to the recruits

26:27.733 --> 26:28.933
when I was in the Academy?

26:28.935 --> 26:30.834
No, I did not.
It was a seminar

26:30.836 --> 26:32.503
on the Mohammed Sadiq shooting.

26:32.505 --> 26:34.805
A lesson in what not to do,
I hope.

26:34.807 --> 26:36.373
Yeah, that's exactly
what it was.

26:36.375 --> 26:37.441
He took us

26:37.443 --> 26:39.076
step by step through
every tactical decision

26:39.078 --> 26:40.210
they made that day.

26:40.212 --> 26:41.545
What did he say about it?

26:41.547 --> 26:43.347
Said it was a perfect storm.

26:43.349 --> 26:45.115
Not that long after 9/11.

26:45.117 --> 26:47.217
A tip that an <i>Arab</i>
was stockpiling weapons.

26:47.219 --> 26:48.919
A cop

26:48.921 --> 26:51.255
had been shot in their precinct
in the housing projects

26:51.257 --> 26:54.725
three days before, so they were
already jacked up and paranoid.

26:54.727 --> 26:58.162
Did he say anything
about the shooting itself?

26:58.164 --> 27:00.497
Said it was the blink of an eye.

27:00.499 --> 27:02.666
Apartment was dark.

27:02.668 --> 27:04.602
Someone moved too fast.

27:04.604 --> 27:07.404
They just opened fire.

27:08.674 --> 27:10.908
Kid was just reaching
for his wallet.

27:12.244 --> 27:14.912
Did he mention
that he shot first?

27:14.914 --> 27:16.213
Yeah, he did.

27:16.215 --> 27:18.882
And the other cops had
a sympathetic response.

27:18.884 --> 27:21.251
But he owned up
to everything, Dad.

27:21.253 --> 27:23.220
I mean, no excuses.

27:25.091 --> 27:27.558
I thought it was pretty brave.

27:28.928 --> 27:32.029
So he's some kind of hero.
No.

27:32.031 --> 27:35.265
But there's more than one
definition of a good cop.

27:35.267 --> 27:37.167
Well...

27:37.169 --> 27:38.702
For what it's worth,

27:38.704 --> 27:40.304
his story,
the way he shared it--

27:40.306 --> 27:42.573
we learned more from him than
any other instructor or boss

27:42.575 --> 27:44.608
who was talking at us.

27:44.610 --> 27:47.044
Anyhow,

27:47.046 --> 27:48.712
my two cents.

27:50.683 --> 27:52.850
(sighs)

27:58.124 --> 28:00.891
I'll set him up,
you knock him down?

28:17.910 --> 28:19.276
Nicholas Walker?

28:19.278 --> 28:20.377
I'm Officer Reagan.

28:20.379 --> 28:21.478
This is Officer Janko.

28:21.480 --> 28:22.780
Officers.
JAMIE: We were hoping

28:22.782 --> 28:25.349
you could help us out with something.
Of course.

28:25.351 --> 28:27.851
If you had an Emmanuel Peralta
ring, inlaid with

28:27.853 --> 28:29.386
diamonds and jade,
turn of the century,

28:29.388 --> 28:30.554
where would you price it?

28:30.556 --> 28:31.989
A Peralta?

28:31.991 --> 28:33.991
Well, I wouldn't sell it here.
I'd take it to auction.

28:33.993 --> 28:35.559
With competitive bidders,
something like that

28:35.561 --> 28:38.862
could go as high as $80,000.

28:38.864 --> 28:40.698
Really?
Conservatively.

28:40.700 --> 28:43.200
How much did you pay the guys
who fenced it?

28:43.202 --> 28:45.502
I don't deal in stolen goods.

28:45.504 --> 28:47.671
No, not in this store,
you don't. Those deals

28:47.673 --> 28:48.939
happen in your studio,

28:48.941 --> 28:50.207
where your real business
is done.

28:50.209 --> 28:52.076
Who told you that?
JAMIE: Tell us what

28:52.078 --> 28:53.711
we want to know,
or detectives will be back

28:53.713 --> 28:54.945
with a warrant
to check the provenance

28:54.947 --> 28:56.213
of every item
in the entire building.

28:56.215 --> 28:58.515
I don't know who you think I am.
We know

28:58.517 --> 29:00.384
who you are and what you are.

29:00.386 --> 29:01.552
Want to call our bluff?

29:01.554 --> 29:04.254
You have no probable cause
for a warrant.

29:04.256 --> 29:06.390
Well, our offer expires

29:06.392 --> 29:09.393
in five, four,

29:09.395 --> 29:10.594
three, two...

29:10.596 --> 29:12.329
Okay.

29:12.331 --> 29:14.331
Okay, they were here.

29:14.333 --> 29:15.899
They brought the Peralta,

29:15.901 --> 29:18.569
but I swear
I didn't know it was stolen.

29:18.571 --> 29:20.104
I don't admit a thing.

29:20.106 --> 29:22.072
Who was it?

29:22.074 --> 29:24.508
(sighs)

29:24.510 --> 29:26.677
Come this way.

29:29.882 --> 29:33.283
For my own protection,
I record every transaction.

29:33.285 --> 29:34.952
So...

29:34.954 --> 29:36.820
this was...

29:36.822 --> 29:39.256
Thursday last.

29:45.498 --> 29:47.564
That's them.

29:51.804 --> 29:53.771
(sighs)

29:56.475 --> 29:59.276
I met the manager
at The Infatuation Lounge.

29:59.278 --> 30:01.211
John Bell did not
work there long.

30:01.213 --> 30:02.479
Bad temper, scary guy.

30:02.481 --> 30:04.314
What about our mystery girl?
Anything on her?

30:04.316 --> 30:06.250
They did not recognize her
as an employee

30:06.252 --> 30:07.618
or a patron of the club.

30:07.620 --> 30:08.652
Great.

30:08.654 --> 30:09.686
Is that John Bell's file?

30:09.688 --> 30:10.754
Yeah, we're looking

30:10.756 --> 30:12.589
into his employment history,
criminal record,

30:12.591 --> 30:14.435
anything that can give us
a clue as to his whereabouts.

30:14.459 --> 30:15.293
DANNY: Son of a bitch

30:15.294 --> 30:17.694
was locked up nine times,
and that's only in Brooklyn.

30:17.696 --> 30:20.030
How the hell is he even
on the streets?

30:20.032 --> 30:22.099
Anyone ever post his bail?
Let's see.

30:22.101 --> 30:24.668
Yes, an Audra Kinney.

30:24.670 --> 30:26.370
In fact, she posted it...

30:26.372 --> 30:28.372
she posted it
in his last two arrests.

30:28.374 --> 30:30.107
Audra Kinney?
Audra.

30:30.109 --> 30:32.409
Adam, union, David,
Ralph, Adam. Punch it in.

30:32.411 --> 30:34.945
(typing)

30:34.947 --> 30:37.147
Here we go.
Criminal mischief, grand larceny,

30:37.149 --> 30:38.682
possession
of stolen property.

30:38.684 --> 30:40.017
She's a real peach.

30:40.019 --> 30:41.518
Got an arrest photo?

30:41.520 --> 30:42.753
(beep)

30:42.755 --> 30:44.288
That looks like her.

30:44.290 --> 30:45.422
Could definitely be her.

30:45.424 --> 30:47.858
What about the cartilage
piercing? She got one?

30:50.129 --> 30:52.696
BAEZ: Well, she's not wearing it
in the photo,

30:52.698 --> 30:54.064
but she definitely
has a piercing.

30:54.066 --> 30:54.998
That's our girl.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.166
That's not enough to go on.

30:56.168 --> 30:58.302
That's all we got.
It'll have to do.

30:58.304 --> 30:59.870
Last known address is
in Fort Greene.

30:59.872 --> 31:01.605
You think John Bell
and his crew will be there?

31:01.607 --> 31:03.874
We're gonna sit on her house
until we find out. Let's go.

31:13.467 --> 31:14.766
(gun clicks)

31:14.768 --> 31:16.635
Did she talk
to you about us?

31:16.637 --> 31:18.503
Not much.

31:18.505 --> 31:20.372
Enough to keep
a hairy eyeball on me?

31:20.374 --> 31:22.374
I like to think of it
as me having her back.

31:22.376 --> 31:24.342
Well, you got her back
on the job.

31:24.344 --> 31:26.678
Well, sometimes it spills over
into real life, too.

31:26.680 --> 31:28.346
She thinks really,
really highly of you.

31:28.348 --> 31:30.348
You should know that.
Thanks.

31:30.350 --> 31:32.317
And I think really,
really highly of her.

31:32.319 --> 31:33.618
You should know that, too.

31:33.620 --> 31:35.420
Uh-huh.

31:35.422 --> 31:36.621
I do.

31:36.623 --> 31:38.757
Only not enough
to always show it, right?

31:38.759 --> 31:40.358
In the past.

31:40.360 --> 31:41.526
Where it belongs.

31:41.528 --> 31:43.895
Yeah.
Good.

31:43.897 --> 31:44.930
What happens in the future...

31:44.932 --> 31:46.331
Between you and her.

31:46.333 --> 31:47.699
Clean slate.

31:47.701 --> 31:49.000
Mm-hmm.

31:49.002 --> 31:51.269
Hey, Audra Kinney's walking back
to her apartment now.

31:51.271 --> 31:53.238
It's time to roll.

31:53.240 --> 31:56.475
Just so you know:
I do got her back.

31:56.477 --> 31:57.776
(guns clicking)

32:15.896 --> 32:16.995
Police.

32:16.997 --> 32:18.063
Don't scream
or try to warn 'em

32:18.065 --> 32:20.232
in any way.
You understand me?

32:20.234 --> 32:22.601
We know
they're inside.

32:22.603 --> 32:24.769
And don't ask who. Gun.

32:27.241 --> 32:28.907
Give me the key.

32:28.909 --> 32:30.609
Take her.

32:37.518 --> 32:39.251
Go, go.
(whispering): Go, go, go!

32:47.394 --> 32:49.661
On the ground!
Police! On the ground right now!

32:49.663 --> 32:51.096
Get on the floor!

32:51.098 --> 32:52.197
Right now-- face down!

32:52.199 --> 32:54.699
Don't move.

32:57.638 --> 32:59.004
(gunshots)

32:59.940 --> 33:01.873
(officers shouting)

33:06.480 --> 33:08.413
Gun! Look out!

33:08.415 --> 33:09.614
(grunts)

33:17.424 --> 33:19.257
Jimmy?

33:19.259 --> 33:20.592
(groans)
Jimmy.

33:20.594 --> 33:21.993
Jimmy.

33:21.995 --> 33:23.662
(groans)
He's hit! Jimmy's hit!

33:23.664 --> 33:25.430
I need some help!

33:25.432 --> 33:26.698
We got an officer down in here!

33:26.700 --> 33:30.168
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.

33:30.170 --> 33:31.870
Hang on.

33:31.872 --> 33:33.605
He's hit, he's hit,
I need some help!

33:33.607 --> 33:35.006
Officer down!

33:35.008 --> 33:38.176
We need some help!

33:46.853 --> 33:49.421
JAMIE:
Maribel, Rosa.

33:49.423 --> 33:50.789
I got some bad news.

33:50.791 --> 33:52.891
What is it?
Is the ring is gone?

33:52.893 --> 33:53.959
No, it's not that.

33:53.961 --> 33:55.961
Rosa Alvarez,
you're under arrest

33:55.963 --> 33:57.762
for grand larceny
and for falsely reporting

33:57.764 --> 33:59.564
an incident.
What?

33:59.566 --> 34:00.966
Put your hands
behind your back.

34:00.968 --> 34:02.867
Rosa, what's going on?
No, no,

34:02.869 --> 34:04.869
this is a mistake. You pigs!

34:04.871 --> 34:07.272
Hey, we have your accomplice in
custody and we have you on tape

34:07.274 --> 34:09.708
at the shop selling the ring,
so you can drop the act.

34:09.710 --> 34:11.676
Yeah, and don't
call us pigs.

34:13.146 --> 34:14.512
Rosa...

34:14.514 --> 34:15.714
Rosa, why?

34:16.717 --> 34:18.683
I needed the money, okay?

34:18.685 --> 34:19.918
For what?

34:19.920 --> 34:21.953
I didn't want to go home.

34:21.955 --> 34:23.521
I wanted to stay.

34:23.523 --> 34:24.856
Looks like
you get your wish.

34:24.858 --> 34:27.592
I don't have family
like you.

34:27.594 --> 34:29.094
I don't have anything.

34:29.096 --> 34:30.228
But you were my friend!

34:30.230 --> 34:32.063
It's just a stupid ring!

34:35.569 --> 34:37.502
Maribel...

34:37.504 --> 34:39.270
I'm sorry.

34:40.741 --> 34:42.072
Let's go.

34:47.414 --> 34:49.214
It's hardest when it's someone

34:49.216 --> 34:50.915
who's close to you.

34:50.917 --> 34:53.485
If it's any comfort,
we see it all the time.

34:54.655 --> 34:56.955
It's no comfort at all.

34:59.626 --> 35:01.192
I hope he's all right.

35:01.194 --> 35:02.460
That was a lot of blood.

35:02.462 --> 35:04.396
(sighs) Yeah.

35:12.139 --> 35:13.638
Guess he's feeling better.

35:13.640 --> 35:15.974
You know, just be a pal

35:15.976 --> 35:17.976
from the precinct or something.

35:17.978 --> 35:18.943
Yep.

35:18.945 --> 35:20.445
Yeah.

35:23.984 --> 35:25.917
Nope.

35:27.788 --> 35:29.621
You still want to go see him?

35:29.623 --> 35:31.056
You know, he really
does look okay,

35:31.058 --> 35:34.993
and we've got a mile
of paperwork, so...

35:34.995 --> 35:36.995
Yeah.

35:39.866 --> 35:42.067
Well, then maybe we should just...
Yeah.

35:42.069 --> 35:44.769
Hey. Hey. Come here.

35:46.139 --> 35:47.138
He did just

35:47.140 --> 35:49.007
take a bullet for you, you know.

35:49.009 --> 35:50.775
I know.

35:50.777 --> 35:52.777
How's that make you feel?

35:54.614 --> 35:56.648
Like we're even.

35:56.650 --> 35:58.883
I could see that.

35:58.885 --> 36:01.386
I'm fine.

36:02.522 --> 36:04.456
You know I can see that, too.

36:04.458 --> 36:06.291
You know,
I was never gonna be able

36:06.293 --> 36:09.360
to take off the vest
anyway, so...

36:09.362 --> 36:10.862
No?

36:13.867 --> 36:15.967
No.

36:15.969 --> 36:18.136
I'm better off this way.

36:20.373 --> 36:21.940
You say so.

36:21.942 --> 36:24.242
Yeah. I say so.

36:25.378 --> 36:27.345
(sighs)

36:46.867 --> 36:49.634
Hey. The ring
was vouchered as evidence,

36:49.636 --> 36:51.536
but we'll try
to get it returned to you

36:51.538 --> 36:53.538
before the ceremony.
I know how important it is.

36:53.540 --> 36:56.207
Thank you, Officer Reagan.

36:56.209 --> 36:58.209
You're welcome, Maribel.

36:58.211 --> 36:59.511
What is your first name?

36:59.513 --> 37:00.912
Jamie.

37:00.914 --> 37:04.382
Jamie.

37:04.384 --> 37:07.285
I know that you went out of
your way, you and your partner.

37:07.287 --> 37:08.553
I appreciate it.

37:08.555 --> 37:10.221
Yeah.

37:10.223 --> 37:13.024
Do you think maybe

37:13.026 --> 37:15.827
you want to return the ring
in person?

37:15.829 --> 37:18.096
What do you mean?

37:18.098 --> 37:20.431
To the wedding.

37:20.433 --> 37:22.100
(chuckles)

37:22.102 --> 37:23.868
Are you asking me
to be your date?

37:23.870 --> 37:26.437
Yes.

37:27.340 --> 37:28.840
Well, it's against
department rules.

37:28.842 --> 37:30.408
Your case isn't really closed.

37:30.410 --> 37:33.077
So then what about
as my protection?

37:33.079 --> 37:36.247
I seem to need some
here in New York.

37:36.249 --> 37:37.482
Like moonlighting?

37:37.484 --> 37:39.217
What's that?

37:39.219 --> 37:41.052
Working security, off-duty.

37:43.156 --> 37:45.256
Call it whatever you want.

37:45.258 --> 37:47.458
That I can do.

37:52.132 --> 37:54.432
(door opens)

38:02.542 --> 38:04.008
Officer Sculley.

38:04.010 --> 38:06.477
So, Grant on his way?

38:06.479 --> 38:10.348
No. This meeting
is just between you and me.

38:10.350 --> 38:12.050
It is not on
anybody's calendar.

38:12.052 --> 38:13.918
Do you want to sit down?

38:17.490 --> 38:20.091
An enterprising reporter

38:20.093 --> 38:22.393
at the <i>Times</i> got his hands
on the promotion list.

38:22.395 --> 38:25.663
I asked him to hold it back,
pending us talking.

38:25.665 --> 38:27.765
Why hold it back?

38:27.767 --> 38:30.335
(chuckles)

38:30.337 --> 38:32.503
Are you really that naive?

38:32.505 --> 38:33.805
I don't know what you mean.

38:33.807 --> 38:35.540
Look, officer.

38:35.542 --> 38:36.875
(sighs)

38:36.877 --> 38:39.077
Tom.

38:40.580 --> 38:42.847
Either you or Grant
or both of you

38:42.849 --> 38:45.850
seem to feel
that this hero version of you

38:45.852 --> 38:48.152
is gonna fly-- it's not.

38:49.623 --> 38:52.223
I think you're a good cop
who's paid dearly

38:52.225 --> 38:55.460
for a terrible lapse
in judgment, but...

38:55.462 --> 38:57.462
out there?

38:57.464 --> 38:59.631
Out there is out there.

38:59.633 --> 39:02.066
I thought blue stood with blue.

39:03.169 --> 39:06.437
But out there is who we serve.

39:06.439 --> 39:07.805
And the moment the <i>Times</i>

39:07.807 --> 39:10.275
puts that list
up on its Web site,

39:10.277 --> 39:12.277
there will be a crowd
around your precinct

39:12.279 --> 39:14.913
tossing everything
they can get their hands on.

39:14.915 --> 39:17.248
Okay, so you're worried
about them.

39:17.250 --> 39:19.751
No, I'm not worried about them.

39:19.753 --> 39:23.488
I am worried about
the other cops in your precinct.

39:23.490 --> 39:25.523
And all
the other precincts.

39:25.525 --> 39:27.525
The fallout on them.

39:27.527 --> 39:30.828
Okay. I see.

39:30.830 --> 39:33.464
(sighs)

39:38.138 --> 39:39.203
(sighs) Southampton,

39:39.205 --> 39:40.939
Garden City out on Long Island.

39:40.941 --> 39:43.908
Albuquerque,
Boulder and San Diego.

39:43.910 --> 39:45.677
Are?

39:45.679 --> 39:47.512
PDs whose chiefs
I have contacted

39:47.514 --> 39:49.881
that have a good slot for you.

39:49.883 --> 39:52.250
All of them making,
by a year from now,

39:52.252 --> 39:54.619
more than you'd
be making here in five.

39:54.621 --> 39:56.921
What if I choose to stay?

39:56.923 --> 39:59.157
You'll get your promotion.

39:59.159 --> 40:00.325
But you'll be riding a desk

40:00.327 --> 40:02.760
out at the Erie Basin
auto pound.

40:05.765 --> 40:07.565
That is not fair,
and you know it.

40:07.567 --> 40:10.101
You want to know
how blue stands with blue?

40:10.103 --> 40:11.769
One of us says

40:11.771 --> 40:13.771
what's best for the rest of us?

40:13.773 --> 40:15.907
I got guys who stand with me.

40:15.909 --> 40:17.809
Including my son Jamie

40:17.811 --> 40:19.110
and my right hand Sid.

40:19.112 --> 40:22.447
But I am not
going to put the other 35,000

40:22.449 --> 40:24.649
men and women of this department

40:24.651 --> 40:28.219
through this wringer
for one cop's crusade.

40:32.025 --> 40:35.760
And if you're the cop
you say you are...

40:38.131 --> 40:40.999
...if you're the cop
I think you are...

40:41.001 --> 40:43.201
you won't either.

40:46.606 --> 40:49.941
(sighs)

40:49.943 --> 40:52.143
Just not fair.

40:54.447 --> 40:56.481
Never said it was.

40:56.483 --> 40:59.851
But it is what's happening here.

41:00.720 --> 41:02.020
(sighs)

41:02.022 --> 41:04.722
<i>Times</i> said that they would
hold back until 6:00,

41:04.724 --> 41:08.459
which means
they'll put it up at 6:01.

41:09.996 --> 41:12.397
I sincerely hope you'll...

41:12.399 --> 41:15.466
get back to me before then.

41:17.837 --> 41:19.704
(paper slides)

41:28.248 --> 41:30.815
(sighs)

41:33.887 --> 41:36.854
(sighs) Thank you.
