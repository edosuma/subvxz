00:18.602 --> 00:20.812
<i>I had spent so much of my life</i>

00:20.896 --> 00:24.733
<i>thinking I was cursed to be fat
and unlucky...</i>

00:25.317 --> 00:26.318
<i>and alone.</i>

00:27.819 --> 00:30.948
<i>But I had finally found true love...</i>

00:32.115 --> 00:34.409
<i>and now, I felt blessed.</i>

00:38.872 --> 00:43.085
<i>Here was this beautiful,
sexy, amazing guy,</i>

00:43.585 --> 00:45.128
<i>and he had picked me.</i>

00:48.131 --> 00:49.883
<i>I was willing to give him everything.</i>

00:52.427 --> 00:54.012
I've never done this before.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.639
That's okay.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.267
You can trust me.

01:19.830 --> 01:20.956
I love you.

01:21.790 --> 01:24.126
That... was fun.

01:24.835 --> 01:25.752
<i>Fun?</i>

01:26.003 --> 01:29.214
<i>Joyriding
through Alabama together was fun.</i>

01:29.298 --> 01:31.300
<i>Cow tipping in Oklahoma was fun.</i>

01:31.675 --> 01:34.553
<i>Ordering pay-per-view porn
and getting pizza was fun.</i>

01:34.970 --> 01:36.054
<i>But this?</i>

01:36.930 --> 01:40.267
<i>Maybe I wasn't cursed,
maybe I was an idiot.</i>

01:46.106 --> 01:47.566
<i>What was I thinking?</i>

01:47.649 --> 01:53.071
<i>I'd left my mom and my home,
Bob, and for what?</i>

01:53.155 --> 01:54.072
<i>Fun?</i>

02:06.710 --> 02:07.711
<i>I won?</i>

02:16.094 --> 02:18.055
Where the F are you? Are you okay?

02:18.472 --> 02:20.307
What do you mean, I'm Miss Magic Jesus?

02:20.390 --> 02:22.017
<i>Magnolia got disqualified.</i>

02:22.726 --> 02:27.022
She cheated on the Bible quiz,
and then she overdosed on pills.

02:27.356 --> 02:28.690
Oh, my God. Is she okay?

02:28.774 --> 02:30.817
<i>Thankfully, yes. She's gonna be fine.</i>

02:30.901 --> 02:32.569
<i>Barnard is taking her to rehab,</i>

02:32.653 --> 02:36.114
which means the first runner-up
gets the crown, you.

02:36.615 --> 02:38.784
<i>But if you're not here
in the next 12 hours,</i>

02:38.867 --> 02:41.161
it goes to the second runner-up, Dixie.

02:46.041 --> 02:47.167
Are you coming?

02:48.085 --> 02:49.044
I don't know.

02:49.336 --> 02:52.464
Listen, I read your note...

02:52.839 --> 02:57.010
...and I... I apologize
for not being there 100 percent

02:57.719 --> 02:59.096
<i>on your pageant day.</i>

02:59.179 --> 03:00.764
<i>I got the DNA test back.</i>

03:00.847 --> 03:03.266
<i>Roxy's not my daughter,
but even if she was,</i>

03:03.350 --> 03:06.311
you and I have worked too hard
for me to give up on you.

03:06.395 --> 03:08.897
So, please don't give up on me.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.274
<i>Especially not for some boy.</i>

03:11.566 --> 03:13.402
<i>I mean, I know you probably can't see it,
but...</i>

03:14.236 --> 03:16.154
Christian is... is not worth it.

03:16.822 --> 03:19.074
<i>Come home before it's too late.</i>

03:31.878 --> 03:33.296
Where's Pastor Mike?

03:33.505 --> 03:35.590
Bathroom. He'll be back in a minute.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.300
Well, I'm ready for my new crown.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.636
I even bumped up my bouffant poof
with more cushion

03:39.720 --> 03:41.179
so it'll lay nice and flat.

03:41.263 --> 03:44.391
No, no, may... maybe this was a mistake.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.477
Oh, too much cushion?
I can take it down a notch.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.771
No, no, not your hair. It's this...

03:50.063 --> 03:52.399
It's this whole pageant thing.

03:52.482 --> 03:56.403
Look, I'm responsible for you now,
which means I have to look out for you.

03:57.195 --> 04:00.490
But I'm worried
that pageants might be toxic.

04:01.032 --> 04:04.411
I pushed Magnolia too hard,
she ended up in rehab.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.164
Oh, that won't happen to me.
I don't do drugs.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.165
Right.

04:08.498 --> 04:12.169
Well, but you're still delicate, erratic.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.629
Oh, well, thank you, Daddy.
I think you're sexy, too.

04:14.713 --> 04:18.675
No, not erotic. Erratic. It... Unstable.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.262
You think I'm crazy?
No, it's okay, everybody does.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.639
My momma took me to every doctor there is.

04:24.890 --> 04:28.810
I got OCD, over-focused ADD,
and I'm on the spectrum.

04:28.894 --> 04:31.271
Sorry, my family's normal.
I don't know what that means.

04:32.355 --> 04:36.651
It means, when I get something in my head,
I'm like a dog with a bone.

04:37.402 --> 04:38.904
If it's revenge, it's revenge.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.781
If it's a guy, it's a guy.

04:41.156 --> 04:44.201
And if it's Miss American Lady,
it's a crown.

04:45.744 --> 04:49.456
That's why my momma put me into pageants,
to channel all of this for good.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.875
- Right.
- Pageants keep me sane.

04:52.334 --> 04:55.420
So don't take my bone away,
or someone might get bit.

04:57.506 --> 05:00.425
What the hell is she doing here?

05:00.509 --> 05:02.010
Sorry for the confusion.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.930
Turns out Patty
will be claiming the crown.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.848
What?! No! You said it was gonna be mine!

05:06.932 --> 05:09.810
I'm sorry. When Bob told me
Patty left town,

05:09.893 --> 05:11.186
- I just assumed...
- Do something!

05:11.603 --> 05:14.022
My crazies get triggered
when somebody changes the plan!

05:14.105 --> 05:15.023
Oh...

05:15.482 --> 05:16.900
This was always the plan.

05:18.443 --> 05:19.277
What?

05:19.611 --> 05:23.657
Come on, Patty,
let's claim what's rightfully yours.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.370
Mm-hmm.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.497
Oh...

05:40.715 --> 05:42.968
<i>I loved being Miss Magic Jesus.</i>

05:43.051 --> 05:46.221
<i>It had been the most magical
two weeks of my life.</i>

05:46.304 --> 05:49.599
<i>I got the key to the city,
I got to read to orphans.</i>

05:49.933 --> 05:52.936
Now, this is your last Wiener Taco
for a little while.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.397
Gotta start tightening
that belt before regionals.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.651
Hmm?

05:59.818 --> 06:02.320
- Still not talking to Christian?
- He's not worth it.

06:02.404 --> 06:04.739
Oh, good. You don't need distractions now.

06:04.823 --> 06:08.910
We got a lot to do before regionals,
starting with getting you a sponsor.

06:09.578 --> 06:12.080
A sponsor? Like my mom has in AA?

06:12.163 --> 06:14.332
No, no, a sponsor like someone
to fund your campaign.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.251
I mean, regionals are not cheap.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.503
Between the entry fee
and the wardrobe and the makeup,

06:18.587 --> 06:20.714
you're looking at upwards of $5,000.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.550
But that is where the sponsor comes in.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.469
Most titleholders find a local business
willing to foot the bill

06:26.553 --> 06:28.722
in exchange for the promotion
of their brand.

06:29.514 --> 06:31.808
Okay, why can't you do it?
Your law firm's a local business.

06:32.225 --> 06:36.104
Well, because ideally, the sponsor's
related to your platform in some way.

06:37.522 --> 06:41.067
Join us for our grand reopening
and the unveiling of our Ween-Mobile.

06:42.277 --> 06:43.278
Choi?

06:44.237 --> 06:45.363
What are you doing?

06:45.697 --> 06:46.573
My job.

06:49.951 --> 06:53.288
My dad sold the Booze 'N Stuff
and bought this place, so...

06:53.788 --> 06:56.583
I'm supposed to be drumming up business
for our grand reopening.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.126
<i>He looked like a wienie,</i>

06:58.209 --> 07:01.880
<i>but his hard shell
gave me an idea for a hard sell.</i>

07:01.963 --> 07:04.466
You want Wiener Taco
to be your pageant sponsor?

07:04.549 --> 07:05.675
Think about it.

07:05.759 --> 07:09.012
It would be a great opportunity to spread
the word about the grand reopening.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.640
And you'd be doing good for the community,

07:11.723 --> 07:15.143
supporting Patty's platform
of raising awareness of eating disorders.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.646
What does Wiener Taco
have to do with eating disorders?

07:17.729 --> 07:19.189
So glad you asked, Mr. Choi.

07:22.901 --> 07:26.696
Like any new restaurateur,
you wanna widen your customer base.

07:26.780 --> 07:27.781
What better way to do that

07:27.864 --> 07:30.075
than by adding healthier options
to the menu?

07:30.158 --> 07:31.534
What's a Leaner Wiener?

07:31.618 --> 07:33.954
It's the healthy version
of the Wiener Taco.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.705
So like a turkey wiener,
or a veggie wiener.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.416
Wouldn't that be a greener wiener?

07:40.251 --> 07:42.963
Imagine, a healthy eating campaign,

07:43.046 --> 07:45.882
fronted by Masonville's
very own Miss Magic Jesus,

07:46.257 --> 07:48.677
who advocates for positive body image.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.637
Also, I could host your grand reopening.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.472
We could call you
the Wiener Queen,

07:52.764 --> 07:54.224
or the Wiener Taco Belle.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.851
- We'll make you a Wiener crown.
- Hold your roll, Choi.

07:56.935 --> 07:59.771
I just opened a business.
What makes you think I have any money

07:59.854 --> 08:01.064
to throw at a pageant girl?

08:01.147 --> 08:03.066
A valid point, Mr. Choi.

08:04.192 --> 08:07.195
Which... is why I took the liberty

08:07.278 --> 08:10.615
of outlining
this multi-pronged marketing plan.

08:15.286 --> 08:16.121
Mom?

08:16.913 --> 08:20.583
Herman Choi loved the Leaner Wiener pitch,
and he's gonna sponsor me for regionals.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.336
Oh, yay!
Oh, we both have good news.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.922
Oh, I got my period,
dodged another pregnancy bullet.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.090
Up top.

08:28.258 --> 08:29.467
Oh, shit.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.136
So, how late are you?

08:32.721 --> 08:34.264
Maybe a week?

08:34.806 --> 08:37.058
Gotta keep a stash of condoms
in your purse.

08:37.142 --> 08:38.226
We used one.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.270
Figures I would be
in the unlucky two percent.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.273
He probably keeps 'em in his wallet.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.567
The heat from your butt
breaks down the latex,

08:45.650 --> 08:47.235
lets the swimmers get through.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.114
Let's just hope
this is a false alarm.

08:53.283 --> 08:56.286
So... your first time?

08:56.828 --> 08:58.204
It's a big deal.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.622
Yeah, he didn't think so.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.084
I told him I loved him afterwards.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.503
- You know what he said?
- "Make me a sandwich"?

09:05.587 --> 09:08.923
"What's your name again"?
"Don't tell my wife"? "I have cash"?

09:09.632 --> 09:11.176
Just some of my greatest hits.

09:12.469 --> 09:13.595
Yeah, no.

09:14.512 --> 09:17.849
Uh, he said... "That was fun."

09:18.558 --> 09:19.517
Oh, Patty.

09:20.185 --> 09:23.563
Nobody's first time
is ever what they expected it to be.

09:23.897 --> 09:28.485
Mine was, well, totally wrong, all of it.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.863
I just want to forget about it.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.409
Hmm?

09:37.243 --> 09:38.078
Well...

09:38.536 --> 09:40.330
it's gonna be a little hard to do now.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.797
<i>Who the hell gets pregnant
the first time they have sex?</i>

09:48.880 --> 09:51.508
<i>After using a condom? I had to be cursed.</i>

09:51.591 --> 09:53.468
I'm freaking the fuck out.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.720
Yeah, that's how I felt.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.764
I... I don't know what to do.

09:58.640 --> 10:03.269
Sweetie, you have to make
the biggest decision of your life.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.815
Are you gonna tell Christian?

10:07.023 --> 10:10.151
Not until I decide what I'm gonna do.

10:12.904 --> 10:13.738
Right.

10:14.364 --> 10:15.281
All right.

10:16.366 --> 10:17.492
Okay.

10:19.369 --> 10:20.870
I never told you this before,

10:20.954 --> 10:24.833
but...
I was gonna give you up for adoption.

10:25.416 --> 10:26.751
Wait, what?

10:26.835 --> 10:30.630
I was young, single,
and I didn't want to get an abortion.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.882
I think a woman should have
the right to choose.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.844
I do, but I... I just personally...

10:36.719 --> 10:37.720
I couldn't do it.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.098
Okay.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.061
When did you decide to keep me?

10:45.562 --> 10:46.896
Right after you were born.

10:48.523 --> 10:52.694
See, I fucked up when I asked the nurse
if I could hold you,

10:52.777 --> 10:56.114
because I figured I'd give you
a proper goodbye

10:56.197 --> 10:58.324
and then hand you off to people

10:58.408 --> 11:02.287
who were a little less,
well... train-wrecky.

11:04.247 --> 11:09.961
But then I held you,
and your little head smelled like cake.

11:11.754 --> 11:15.341
And you just looked up at me
like you were just daring me to raise you.

11:17.051 --> 11:20.471
And that's when I knew
I could never let you go.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.895
And you think that was a mistake?

11:27.228 --> 11:30.315
Oh, baby, no. No, no, no. Not for me.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.442
But for you?

11:34.944 --> 11:38.656
Maybe you could have had a better life
with someone else.

11:40.742 --> 11:43.912
Well, then I wouldn't be me
if I didn't have you.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.332
Right. Oh, my baby.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.254
So, what do you think I should do?

11:55.048 --> 11:58.885
The idea of my 17-year-old daughter
having a baby seems ridiculous.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.138
And the idea of me being a grandma,
come on.

12:06.100 --> 12:09.229
So you think I should have an abortion?

12:09.854 --> 12:11.022
Theoretically, yeah.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.234
But in reality, no.

12:15.526 --> 12:17.987
So I honestly don't know
what to tell you.

12:18.905 --> 12:22.283
It's times like these
I do wish you had a dad,

12:22.575 --> 12:25.245
or another person to weigh in.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.206
I have Bob.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.334
You know, yeah.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.836
Maybe you should talk to him.

12:42.053 --> 12:44.097
<i>I was finally in an upswing,</i>

12:44.180 --> 12:46.307
<i>and with Brick away
at a wrestling retreat,</i>

12:46.391 --> 12:49.852
<i>I could relax and get some
much-needed self-care.</i>

12:49.936 --> 12:52.355
Oh, sorry. Too deep?

12:52.438 --> 12:53.773
Never.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.526
Come on, Shane,
you've been working on me for years.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.529
You should know by now,
the deeper the better.

12:59.737 --> 13:00.571
Right.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.741
So, how's, uh...? How's Coralee?

13:04.575 --> 13:06.869
<i>So much for relaxing.</i>

13:10.248 --> 13:12.041
Hello?

13:14.460 --> 13:16.004
I'll... I'll be right there.

13:19.632 --> 13:23.011
<i>My father had collapsed.
Chest pains, they said.</i>

13:23.094 --> 13:26.222
<i>But until I knew more,
I chose to stay calm.</i>

13:29.267 --> 13:31.602
<i>Until my own heart leapt out of my chest.</i>

13:38.943 --> 13:40.069
I can't believe you're here.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.697
Well, I'm still your father's
emergency contact.

13:43.323 --> 13:47.827
Plus, no matter what's going on
between us... I'm still your wife.

13:48.119 --> 13:49.454
Where are you staying?

13:49.912 --> 13:53.791
- You could come home, and we could...
- At the Palomino in town.

13:54.876 --> 13:57.337
- Have you talked to the doctors?
- Not yet.

14:00.298 --> 14:01.924
It's Patty.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.469
- Hello?
<i>- Bob. Can you meet me in person?</i>

14:05.345 --> 14:08.097
We need to talk. It's, uh, an emergency.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.808
Yeah, I'm kind of having
my own emergency right now.

14:10.892 --> 14:14.645
- My dad's in the hospital.
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

14:14.812 --> 14:17.523
Never mind, we can talk later.
You've got enough to deal with.

14:17.607 --> 14:20.485
Okay, just tell me now
'cause otherwise I'll worry.

14:20.568 --> 14:21.819
Not over the phone.

14:21.903 --> 14:24.655
- Patty, just spit it out. I don't...
- I'm pregnant.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.868
- Is it Brick's?
- It's Christian's.

14:29.118 --> 14:32.497
How could you be so irresponsible?

14:32.580 --> 14:34.457
I wasn't, we used a condom.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.794
<i>I just have horrible luck,
and now everything is ruined.</i>

14:37.877 --> 14:41.130
Miss Magic Jesus, my future.
Just please tell me what to do.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.341
<i>My mom's too close to it.</i>

14:43.424 --> 14:46.302
<i>- You're my coach and my godfather.</i>
- I'm also a man,

14:46.386 --> 14:48.930
which means I have no right to tell you
what to do with your body.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.890
Bob... is Patty pregnant?

14:51.140 --> 14:52.892
No. I...

14:53.226 --> 14:54.519
Mr. Armstrong?

14:54.977 --> 14:56.312
I gotta go.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.438
N...

15:03.194 --> 15:06.531
<i>I couldn't believe everyone else
got to go about their business,</i>

15:06.614 --> 15:10.284
<i>and I had to make
the biggest decision of my life.</i>

15:11.077 --> 15:12.036
How's my dad?

15:12.120 --> 15:14.247
He's had a heart attack,
he'll need a triple bypass.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.164
Oh, no.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.875
He's awake, and he wants
to speak with you now. Alone.

15:26.592 --> 15:29.053
I haven't been in a hospital
since my vasectomy.

15:29.971 --> 15:33.057
Scariest part of that was having
another man shave my balls.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.852
Now, I could die.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.103
But...

15:37.186 --> 15:40.314
...bypass surgery is a heart surgeon's
bread and butter.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.983
I... I'm sure you'll be fine.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.401
On the off chance that I'm not,

15:43.484 --> 15:45.528
there's a few things
I want to get off my chest.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.740
I know you and I haven't had
the easiest relationship.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.994
I've been hard on you your whole life.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.746
- Yeah, but it's okay. We don't need...
- There's a reason for that.

15:55.830 --> 15:56.998
Yeah.

15:57.373 --> 16:01.127
It's because the only ball I could throw
was the kind where people danced.

16:02.670 --> 16:03.838
No.

16:05.381 --> 16:08.593
Because I always resented
the attention you got from your mother.

16:09.844 --> 16:12.972
Oh, son, the two of you
were like peas in a pod.

16:13.848 --> 16:17.185
You loved all the same things.
Purses, shoes...

16:19.020 --> 16:20.146
I was jealous.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.483
You were closer to your mother
than I could ever be.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.276
You were jealous of me?

16:25.776 --> 16:28.779
Your mother was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

16:28.946 --> 16:31.157
And if you know what's good for you,

16:31.240 --> 16:34.202
you'll fight for the best thing
that's ever happened to you.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.287
Coralee.

16:40.750 --> 16:41.709
I'm trying.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.170
Try harder.

16:52.803 --> 16:56.015
<i>Mom didn't know what to tell me,
Bob refused to weigh in.</i>

16:56.307 --> 16:58.017
<i>I might have been with child,</i>

16:58.100 --> 17:00.853
<i>but I had never felt more alone
in my life.</i>

17:04.022 --> 17:05.023
Oh.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.234
Hi.

17:07.693 --> 17:08.569
Hi.

17:10.988 --> 17:11.864
Are you okay?

17:11.948 --> 17:13.699
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

17:13.782 --> 17:16.035
You're doing that thing
when you have a panic attack,

17:16.117 --> 17:18.621
and you're breathing fast
and your nostrils flare.

17:18.704 --> 17:19.789
Okay, I'm not fine.

17:21.874 --> 17:22.708
So, talk to me.

17:23.376 --> 17:27.713
I thought you didn't want me to,
after your confession?

17:28.130 --> 17:29.674
Yeah, well, I have Dee now.

17:30.341 --> 17:34.387
But having a girlfriend
isn't the same as having a bestie.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.514
I know.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.225
I mean, not about having a girlfriend.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.227
I'm assuming it's the same
as having a boyfriend.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.354
Not exactly.

17:44.689 --> 17:47.900
I mean... at least you guys
don't have to worry about...

17:49.235 --> 17:52.280
one of you accidentally getting pregnant.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.034
Patty, are you pregnant?

18:03.791 --> 18:05.001
It's Christian's.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.962
I haven't told him yet.
Not until I decide what to do.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.922
You're not thinking of keeping it,
are you?

18:10.006 --> 18:11.340
I mean, my mom did.

18:11.674 --> 18:13.968
And if she hadn't, I wouldn't exist.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.679
She said she never felt love like that
in her life.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.765
Maybe that's what'll make me feel whole.

18:19.849 --> 18:22.018
Patty, you're 17.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.604
You have no job, no money.

18:24.687 --> 18:26.814
You haven't even graduated
from high school yet.

18:28.316 --> 18:32.111
And I think you and I can both agree,
you're not exactly a role model.

18:39.785 --> 18:40.911
I'm getting an abortion.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.456
You... already decided?

18:43.539 --> 18:45.333
Well, what are you doing here?

18:45.416 --> 18:47.335
I... I thought you wanted
to talk things through?

18:47.418 --> 18:49.962
I wanted to make sure you thought
I was making the right choice.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.549
Oh, it doesn't matter what I think.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.968
You're the one who's gonna have to live
with this decision

18:56.052 --> 18:57.219
for the rest of your life.

18:58.179 --> 19:01.891
I do have to let you know the state
of Georgia requires parental consent.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.934
What? Why? It's my body.

19:04.018 --> 19:05.561
Not according to the law.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.773
I really don't want to put my mom
in that position.

19:08.856 --> 19:11.192
- When do you turn 18?
- In, like, a month.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.070
Waiting seems like a bad idea.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.154
Yeah, and...

19:15.946 --> 19:19.992
if I petition the court
to waive parental consent...

19:21.035 --> 19:22.536
it could take even longer.

19:22.787 --> 19:24.705
Okay, it feels like
there's no good choice.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.582
Well, sometimes there isn't.

19:30.544 --> 19:34.382
Should I see if Herman Choi can postpone
the Wiener Taco grand reopening?

19:34.465 --> 19:36.634
We both have a lot on our minds.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.344
I need the distraction.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.554
But if you can't make it,
I totally get it.

19:40.638 --> 19:41.472
I will.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.599
Good luck with your dad.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.104
Oh, so sorry. Bob.

19:48.312 --> 19:51.899
Hey, you're good with color.
What do you think of a green wallpaper?

19:52.817 --> 19:55.986
- Hey, this one matches your eyes.
- What are you doing here?

19:56.404 --> 19:57.947
- What? You don't know?
- Know what?

19:58.698 --> 19:59.824
I work here now.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.617
I resigned from the DA's office.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.285
You work here? Since when?

20:03.369 --> 20:06.831
Today. Your father made me a huge offer.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.041
I guess having his heart attack
made him take stock.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.627
- Said he's making some big changes.
- Is this a f... joke?

20:11.711 --> 20:14.630
No, not at all. I'm just getting
a head start redecorating my office.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.966
What... What about your plans
to run for mayor?

20:17.049 --> 20:19.927
- Isn't it better for you to stay the DA?
- Hmm...

20:20.302 --> 20:23.013
You sure ask a lot of questions
for a guy using office hours

20:23.097 --> 20:24.807
to work with pageant clients.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.309
- Does your dad know you do that?
- Back off, Bob!

20:30.146 --> 20:30.980
Hmm.

20:35.067 --> 20:38.654
How the hell am I going to tell my mom
that I want an abortion,

20:38.863 --> 20:40.239
and that I need her to sign off?

20:40.322 --> 20:42.783
What about Christian?
Have you told him yet?

20:44.076 --> 20:45.494
I don't know what to say.

20:47.496 --> 20:49.081
What are you doing?

20:50.249 --> 20:51.167
Drafting a text.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.587
"Hey, it's Patty. I'm knocked up and..."
Uh...

20:55.796 --> 20:58.340
- Oops.
- What? Oops what?

20:58.424 --> 21:00.968
- Did you accidentally send it?
- Psych.

21:02.470 --> 21:04.638
- You're an asshole.
- And you missed me.

21:04.722 --> 21:07.016
I super, super did.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.687
Oh! Hey, is this, like, okay?

21:13.814 --> 21:16.567
- I mean, you know, because the...
- It's fine.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.986
So, you're totally over me?

21:20.029 --> 21:21.322
- It isn't weird?
- No.

21:22.323 --> 21:23.657
It's like the opposite of weird.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.034
Ah...

21:25.201 --> 21:26.243
Awesome.

21:26.327 --> 21:30.080
'Cause I wanted to ask you to sleep over,
but I didn't want it to be weird.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.041
But now that I know that it's not,
can you?

21:32.750 --> 21:34.126
I don't want to be alone today.

21:34.919 --> 21:35.836
Sure.

21:36.545 --> 21:37.546
Absolutely.

21:43.385 --> 21:45.221
- Okay, you know what?
- Hmm?

21:45.429 --> 21:46.388
It is weird.

21:47.181 --> 21:48.349
What? Why?

21:48.432 --> 21:49.975
Because you're on top of me.

21:50.267 --> 21:54.522
And I know it doesn't mean anything,
but my body doesn't, and I just...

21:56.524 --> 21:59.318
I'll see you tomorrow
at the Wiener Taco opening, okay?

22:05.783 --> 22:10.329
<i>I was furious at my father
for hiring Bob "Balls for Brains" Barnard.</i>

22:10.412 --> 22:13.040
<i>But I couldn't confront him
on the eve of his surgery,</i>

22:13.123 --> 22:17.002
<i>so instead, I chose to focus
on opening up Coralee's heart.</i>

22:17.086 --> 22:20.005
<i>And her shoulders,
and her hip flexors, and her neck.</i>

22:20.089 --> 22:21.131
Smells great.

22:21.632 --> 22:23.509
Coq au vin, it's Coralee's favorite.

22:24.426 --> 22:27.388
Things lately between us
have been a little tense.

22:28.430 --> 22:31.684
Hello, Bob?
I'm here, but I'm a little early.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.102
Sorry about that.

22:34.645 --> 22:36.021
What's all this?

22:36.814 --> 22:37.773
Shane?

22:37.857 --> 22:39.441
What's he doing here?

22:39.525 --> 22:42.319
I booked you a massage.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.864
And I cooked dinner and got flowers.

22:44.947 --> 22:46.657
Okay, I thought we were gonna talk.

22:46.991 --> 22:50.411
We are. I just...
I wanted to show you how much I care.

22:50.494 --> 22:54.582
Do you think that wining and dining me
is gonna make me forget about everything?

22:54.665 --> 22:56.333
- Because...
- It's a Band-Aid, Bob.

22:57.459 --> 22:59.336
- Nobody asked you, Shane.
- I'm just saying.

22:59.712 --> 23:02.256
I'm getting certified to be a life coach,

23:02.339 --> 23:06.343
and the first step in resolving
any problem is radical honesty.

23:06.427 --> 23:07.595
So if you two were to sit...

23:07.678 --> 23:11.181
Shane, please pack up your stuff and go.

23:13.309 --> 23:16.186
- You know what? Maybe I should go, too.
- No, don't. Don't.

23:16.437 --> 23:17.354
Please don't.

23:18.606 --> 23:19.690
Give me a chance.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.610
- So are you gonna Venmo me?
- Shane, get out!

23:22.985 --> 23:25.112
Okay, no.
Thank you very much, I appreciate it.

23:29.325 --> 23:30.284
You know what?

23:30.910 --> 23:33.287
Maybe that Shane did have a point.

23:35.247 --> 23:39.251
Complete radical honesty.

23:49.637 --> 23:52.056
- Ask me anything.
- Okay, Stella Rose.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.850
Uh, when did it end?

23:55.100 --> 23:56.685
- Twenty years ago.
- Why?

23:56.936 --> 23:59.313
You were pregnant, with Cat.

23:59.396 --> 24:00.773
Did she ask you to leave me?

24:00.856 --> 24:01.690
Yes.

24:01.774 --> 24:02.775
Did you consider?

24:02.858 --> 24:04.818
- Yes.
- Fuck you, Bob.

24:04.902 --> 24:07.112
I'm being radically honest.

24:07.196 --> 24:08.113
I want you to trust me.

24:08.322 --> 24:09.198
Mm!

24:09.740 --> 24:11.367
Trust you? I hate you.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.953
Good. That means you still care.

24:15.245 --> 24:16.372
How was the sex?

24:18.040 --> 24:18.874
Good.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.585
Good, or great?

24:22.670 --> 24:26.298
- Different.
- Oh, please explain in detail.

24:26.757 --> 24:32.054
She was into role-playing and light BDSM.

24:32.680 --> 24:33.722
Like spanking?

24:33.806 --> 24:35.849
Yeah. And other stuff,

24:35.933 --> 24:38.602
like bondage, and choking,

24:38.686 --> 24:41.438
and breath-play.

24:41.647 --> 24:43.816
What the fuck is breath-play, Bob?

24:48.237 --> 24:49.905
Do you think about her when you're alone?

24:51.281 --> 24:52.116
Sometimes.

24:52.199 --> 24:54.618
Do you think about her
when you're with me?

24:55.369 --> 24:57.121
- Not anymore.
- Did you love her?

24:57.538 --> 25:00.499
I did. Once. A long time ago.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.751
Did you love her more than you loved me?

25:02.835 --> 25:04.003
Never.

25:05.129 --> 25:07.423
Then what did she give you
that I couldn't?

25:09.800 --> 25:13.971
She... appreciated the parts of me

25:14.221 --> 25:16.640
that you just don't understand.

25:16.724 --> 25:18.475
She... She saw me.

25:18.559 --> 25:19.893
Well, I see you.

25:19.977 --> 25:23.313
No, I know how you roll your eyes at me.

25:23.397 --> 25:26.567
All the pageant stuff.
You... You think I'm ridiculous.

25:26.650 --> 25:29.319
No, I don't. I think you're evolved.

25:30.904 --> 25:34.116
You know, it takes a really secure man

25:34.533 --> 25:38.370
to put his ego aside
and let a woman shine.

25:40.080 --> 25:43.625
And you've been doing that for me
since the moment I met you.

25:45.169 --> 25:50.090
It's what made me finally feel... special.

25:54.178 --> 25:57.181
And I guess you found someone
that made you feel that way.

26:00.517 --> 26:02.519
Just happened to be when we were married.

26:06.190 --> 26:09.193
Maybe one person can't give you
everything that you need.

26:11.070 --> 26:11.904
You do.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.199
You do see me.

26:17.826 --> 26:21.413
And honestly, I've never been
more in love with you than I am right now.

26:31.256 --> 26:33.008
<i>The news was all good.</i>

26:33.383 --> 26:35.803
<i>Any blockages to my father's heart
had been removed,</i>

26:35.886 --> 26:39.223
<i>and so had any obstacles
between me and Coralee.</i>

26:39.306 --> 26:40.182
Hey.

26:40.682 --> 26:41.642
Get a room.

26:43.143 --> 26:44.853
I see you took my advice.

26:45.062 --> 26:45.896
Yeah.

26:47.064 --> 26:47.981
Thanks for that.

26:48.982 --> 26:51.193
I'm surprised
you were able to pull it off.

26:51.276 --> 26:54.988
Coralee, I thought you'd actually
want a guy who was,

26:55.197 --> 26:58.367
you know, more like... a guy.

27:00.202 --> 27:01.078
Wow...

27:01.328 --> 27:05.707
Dad, you must be the only man in history

27:05.791 --> 27:09.670
to have a brush with mortality
and become an even bigger asshole.

27:09.753 --> 27:11.380
- Okay, Bob. It's okay.
- No.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.091
I thought we finally had a breakthrough.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.718
Just because we had
one touchy-feely moment,

27:16.802 --> 27:19.179
doesn't mean I went soft like you.

27:19.263 --> 27:23.600
I can't believe you hired
Bob "Backbiter" Barnard behind my back!

27:23.684 --> 27:24.852
It was just business.

27:25.102 --> 27:28.689
I didn't tell you because I didn't wanna
deal with you having a temper tantrum.

27:28.772 --> 27:31.275
I am not having a tantrum!

27:31.358 --> 27:34.194
I am feeling hurt and angry!

27:34.278 --> 27:38.198
Okay, okay. Okay, Bob,
let's just go have a time-out. It's okay.

27:42.619 --> 27:45.956
How could he hire Barnard?
Knowing how I feel about him?

27:46.456 --> 27:47.666
I don't know.

27:48.250 --> 27:51.587
Actually, you do know,
'cause you did the same thing.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.715
You ran to Barnard behind my back.

27:54.798 --> 27:56.925
Why him of all people?

27:57.009 --> 28:00.762
Okay, you know what, Bob?
I don't know. We're friends, and...

28:00.846 --> 28:02.973
Did you sleep with him?

28:03.056 --> 28:05.893
With Barnard?
No, I did not sleep with him.

28:05.976 --> 28:08.395
Of course I did not sleep with him.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.275
Did...?

28:13.358 --> 28:14.735
Did you sleep with someone else?

28:17.279 --> 28:19.948
Oh, my God! Who is it?

28:20.282 --> 28:22.201
Coralee, you answer me right now.

28:22.284 --> 28:23.869
Radical honesty.

28:23.952 --> 28:25.787
Okay, it was Shane.

28:26.288 --> 28:28.665
Our massage therapist?

28:29.625 --> 28:31.710
He... He had his hands on my ass yesterday.

28:31.793 --> 28:33.378
You know what? You can't be mad.

28:33.462 --> 28:35.797
You cheated. I cheated. We both cheated.

28:35.881 --> 28:38.342
I slept with Stella Rose 20 years ago.

28:38.425 --> 28:40.594
You slept with Shane,
what, 20 minutes ago?

28:48.977 --> 28:51.396
Bob, wait, you can't just leave.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.439
Why not?

28:52.981 --> 28:53.815
You did.

29:04.034 --> 29:08.080
It has recently been brought
to my attention that you're pregnant.

29:08.372 --> 29:10.666
- Who told you that?
- It doesn't matter.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.961
We cannot have an unwed
pregnant teenager

29:14.044 --> 29:15.545
representing Miss Magic Jesus.

29:15.629 --> 29:17.506
Which is why I'm getting an abortion,

29:17.798 --> 29:20.008
- so nobody will have to know.
- That is not any better.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.011
I'm sorry.
I need to strip you of your crown.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.472
Wait, what? How is that fair?

29:25.555 --> 29:27.683
I can't be pregnant
and I can't get an abortion?

29:27.891 --> 29:30.394
You should have thought about that
before you had premarital sex.

29:31.061 --> 29:33.897
Right, because if a guy has sex,
he's a stud,

29:33.981 --> 29:35.440
but if a girl does it, she's a slut?

29:35.524 --> 29:36.650
Patty, don't.

29:36.733 --> 29:39.736
- Don't you want to know who the father is?
- It's me. I'm the father.

29:40.279 --> 29:43.365
My God, thank God you're safe.
Your mom and I were so worried.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.951
Christian, what are you doing here?

29:46.034 --> 29:48.203
When you wouldn't answer my calls,
I called your mom.

29:48.287 --> 29:51.415
- She told me you were in trouble.
- Wait, did you say you're the father?

29:51.498 --> 29:53.542
- My mom told you?
- No, not that you're pregnant.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.294
I had no idea until just now.

29:55.377 --> 29:57.796
I came back because I was worried
something was really wrong,

29:57.879 --> 29:58.922
but this is so cool.

29:59.006 --> 30:01.216
I mean, we can get married,
raise the baby together.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.051
What? No. No, I'm having an abortion.

30:03.135 --> 30:04.594
Okay, everybody, let's calm down.

30:04.678 --> 30:07.681
Patty could be a shining example
of family values.

30:07.764 --> 30:09.349
You could totally let her keep the crown.

30:09.433 --> 30:12.102
I mean, you'd have to let me skip
military school, but...

30:15.022 --> 30:16.231
Are you using me?

30:16.315 --> 30:17.274
No.

30:17.774 --> 30:18.608
I love you.

30:18.692 --> 30:19.568
No, you don't.

30:19.651 --> 30:20.819
I want us to be a family.

30:20.902 --> 30:22.321
You, me, and our baby.

30:22.404 --> 30:24.906
It's not a baby. Okay?
There is no baby, it's just cells.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.075
This is why I didn't want to tell you.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.704
- What's wrong?
- Ah! Ow!

30:35.042 --> 30:37.294
<i>They say a child is a blessing.</i>

30:38.211 --> 30:41.965
<i>So the idea of losing one shouldn't have
come as a surprise to someone like me.</i>

30:42.049 --> 30:43.258
You're not pregnant.

30:43.592 --> 30:44.634
I'm having a miscarriage?

30:44.718 --> 30:47.054
No, I mean that you were never pregnant.

30:49.639 --> 30:51.892
The ultrasound revealed
that you have a teratoma.

30:52.642 --> 30:54.561
- A what?
- A teratoma.

30:55.145 --> 30:56.938
Also known as a chimera.

30:57.439 --> 31:00.984
It's a parasitic twin
that you consumed in utero.

31:02.319 --> 31:03.820
I've never encountered one before.

31:03.904 --> 31:05.781
What the fuck are you talking about, lady?

31:05.864 --> 31:09.493
It's very, very rare.
Maybe one in 40,000.

31:09.826 --> 31:12.329
Even less likely than getting
knocked up with a condom.

31:12.412 --> 31:14.998
<i>So I wasn't cursed. I was a freak.</i>

31:15.082 --> 31:17.751
I took a pregnancy test.
It came back positive.

31:17.834 --> 31:21.296
A teratoma can cause a missed period
and a false positive.

31:21.671 --> 31:24.091
So, we're not having a baby?

31:24.591 --> 31:27.969
Wait. You're saying that
I could have been a twin? But I ate it?

31:28.261 --> 31:30.430
- I wouldn't say that you ate it.
- That's kind of badass.

31:30.514 --> 31:31.848
What is wrong with you?

31:31.932 --> 31:33.141
What is wrong with me?

31:33.558 --> 31:35.560
What kind of person eats her own twin?

31:35.644 --> 31:38.438
Just to be clear, I am definitely
not saying that you ate it.

31:38.522 --> 31:39.940
It makes sense

31:40.023 --> 31:41.942
that you were a compulsive eater
from the start.

31:43.527 --> 31:44.611
I'm a monster.

31:45.278 --> 31:46.363
No wonder you don't love me.

31:46.863 --> 31:47.864
But I do.

31:49.408 --> 31:50.659
Baby or no baby.

31:51.618 --> 31:55.205
I came back before I even knew
that you were pregnant. Remember?

31:55.622 --> 31:57.624
Is it dangerous, this twin?

31:57.833 --> 31:59.167
Oh, she's fine.

31:59.251 --> 32:01.711
Today's incident
was most likely caused by stress,

32:01.795 --> 32:05.465
but I'd still suggest having it removed
to avoid further complications.

32:05.674 --> 32:06.758
You mean, like surgery?

32:07.092 --> 32:09.052
- Mm-hmm.
- Can that be done, like, outpatient?

32:09.136 --> 32:10.804
It's major abdominal surgery.

32:11.096 --> 32:14.599
It's three days in the hospital,
maybe eight weeks to fully recover.

32:14.683 --> 32:17.477
Mm-mm.
Regionals are in a month and a half.

32:17.561 --> 32:18.895
You wouldn't be able to compete.

32:18.979 --> 32:21.231
Is it...? Is it okay to wait?

32:22.357 --> 32:26.445
Uh, she has had it her whole life,
and it's only now become symptomatic.

32:26.987 --> 32:29.114
I'd say another month or two won't hurt.

32:30.740 --> 32:33.243
I can't believe
I could have had another kid.

32:33.618 --> 32:34.995
I can't believe I'm not pregnant.

32:35.203 --> 32:38.957
I can't believe
you get to keep your crown. Right?

32:39.499 --> 32:41.293
I need to talk to Patty alone.

32:41.877 --> 32:43.336
This thing inside you...

32:43.420 --> 32:45.088
Can you talk to her later?

32:45.172 --> 32:49.009
Patty, the Wiener Taco grand reopening
started 20 minutes ago.

32:49.551 --> 32:51.011
You feeling up to it?

32:53.013 --> 32:54.890
<i>Of course I was feeling up to it.</i>

32:54.973 --> 32:57.809
<i>I wasn't cursed, I was lucky as shit!</i>

32:58.393 --> 33:00.395
<i>I had dodged a pregnancy bullet.</i>

33:00.729 --> 33:03.106
<i>Nothing could rain
on my Wiener Taco parade.</i>

33:03.982 --> 33:07.652
<i>Sure, I had a weird absorbed twin,
but that was a problem for another day.</i>

33:08.820 --> 33:10.197
Patty, we need to talk.

33:11.031 --> 33:13.492
Um, can we talk later?
I have Wiener Queen duty.

33:13.575 --> 33:16.411
No wiener is more important
than your spiritual sanctity.

33:17.287 --> 33:20.165
Forget about regionals,
we need to get that thing out of you.

33:20.582 --> 33:22.501
Whatever's inside of you is pure evil.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.711
- What?
- I felt it

33:24.794 --> 33:27.589
when I laid my hands on you
before your baptism.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.049
Now I understand why.

33:29.549 --> 33:31.343
I thought the baptism
would take care of it,

33:31.426 --> 33:33.220
but it's so much worse than I thought.

33:33.303 --> 33:36.139
I don't know if that thing
is mad that it never got born,

33:36.223 --> 33:38.517
or if there's some kind of demon...

33:38.600 --> 33:42.646
Wait. Are you saying I could have
an actual demon inside me?

33:42.729 --> 33:43.897
- That's crazy.
- Is it?

33:44.523 --> 33:47.400
You said it yourself,
you thought you couldn't be saved.

33:47.484 --> 33:50.695
<i>I've also said I had a demon,
but I didn't mean it literally.</i>

33:50.904 --> 33:53.114
- Thank God you're here.
- What happened?

33:53.198 --> 33:56.034
Explain later.
It's time to unveil the Ween-Mobile.

33:58.703 --> 34:00.205
- Patty.
- Stay away from her.

34:00.288 --> 34:01.331
She's bad news.

34:01.414 --> 34:04.084
- But I love her.
- Military school is still an option.

34:04.167 --> 34:07.796
We do not want to have another situation
like we did in Brazil, do we?

34:14.636 --> 34:16.263
- What is she doing here?
- Ah.

34:16.888 --> 34:19.683
I thought you told Pastor Mike
she was pregnant?

34:20.684 --> 34:22.393
Let me do some recon.

34:32.571 --> 34:33.947
- Patty didn't lose her crown...
- Jeez!

34:34.030 --> 34:35.031
...for being pregnant?

34:35.114 --> 34:38.409
- How did you know she was pregnant?
- The office walls are thin.

34:38.493 --> 34:40.161
I heard the entire conversation.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.038
Are you the one who told Pastor Mike?

34:42.871 --> 34:46.333
You can't keep secrets from me.
Especially now that I'm your boss.

34:47.335 --> 34:48.460
Sorry, you're my what?

34:48.545 --> 34:51.255
Yeah, your father's retiring,
making me senior partner.

34:51.339 --> 34:53.466
From now on, you report to me.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.344
Figured your name should be smaller
because I'm senior partner.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.263
Are you... kidding me?

34:58.847 --> 35:01.975
You humiliate me
at the mother-daughter pageant.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.894
You weasel your way into my marriage.

35:04.978 --> 35:08.440
You are constantly trying
to sabotage Patty.

35:08.523 --> 35:11.693
And now this.
I mean, what did I ever do to you?

35:11.776 --> 35:14.863
This isn't about you, Bob.
This is about survival.

35:15.447 --> 35:16.323
This...

35:17.449 --> 35:20.910
I made a couple of bad investments,
and I am damn near broke.

35:21.911 --> 35:23.413
When I heard about your father's health,

35:23.496 --> 35:25.915
I told him he needed
to think about his legacy.

35:25.999 --> 35:27.959
- Wait a minute.
- So this was your idea?

35:28.043 --> 35:30.962
He was more than happy to turn
the company over to a better man.

35:33.006 --> 35:36.635
And now,
introducing the Wieneriffic Ween-Mobile.

35:37.218 --> 35:39.262
So you can get your wieners
when you're in-between-er.

35:52.317 --> 35:53.610
Give me that crown!

35:54.694 --> 35:55.570
What?

35:56.321 --> 35:59.741
Patty Bladell had a wiener in her taco.

36:00.408 --> 36:01.910
She's a knocked-up slut.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.745
I am not. I have a teratoma.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.955
That's not even a real word.

36:06.706 --> 36:07.540
Give it to me!

36:15.799 --> 36:18.134
Patty.

36:28.311 --> 36:32.273
Just save it, all right?
Just don't even start.

36:37.529 --> 36:38.363
Bob...

36:39.698 --> 36:40.532
you're beautiful.

36:44.786 --> 36:45.995
Oh!

36:54.504 --> 36:55.547
Hey! Hey, quit.

36:56.256 --> 36:57.215
Quit it!

36:57.298 --> 36:58.800
Wh... Wh...

36:59.050 --> 37:00.802
Why do you keep fucking with me?

37:01.469 --> 37:02.971
Do you really hate me that much?

37:03.513 --> 37:04.639
I love you.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.309
What do you mean, you love me?

37:11.604 --> 37:13.314
Since we were 14 years old.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.775
That's why we couldn't be friends anymore,

37:15.859 --> 37:18.820
because I knew what I wanted,
and I knew you didn't want it.

37:20.488 --> 37:21.406
I... I don't.

38:01.988 --> 38:04.699
- She has teeth like a shark!
- Holy shit, she has fangs!

38:04.783 --> 38:07.285
You... bitch.

38:28.807 --> 38:30.183
Oh, my God!

38:37.524 --> 38:40.527
<i>I had been so worried
I created a life,</i>

38:40.610 --> 38:43.863
<i>but now I may have taken one.</i>

38:45.406 --> 38:47.325
<i>Maybe Pastor Mike was right,</i>

38:47.408 --> 38:50.119
<i>maybe there was evil inside me.</i>

38:50.537 --> 38:52.789
<i>I always knew
there was something wrong with me.</i>

38:52.872 --> 38:55.208
<i>My eating, my rage.</i>

38:56.918 --> 38:58.628
<i>What if I wasn't cursed?</i>

38:58.711 --> 39:00.630
<i>What if I was possessed?</i>

39:01.881 --> 39:04.217
<i>How the hell do you abort a demon?</i>

39:05.305 --> 39:11.484
