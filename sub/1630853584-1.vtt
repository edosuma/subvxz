WEBVTT

03:04.009 --> 03:05.272
Sir.

03:06.273 --> 03:07.665
Sir, can you hear me?

03:11.452 --> 03:15.064
Control, 2-Adam-3,
we'’re gonna need medical

03:15.238 --> 03:17.806
for a male who'’s been shot
to the left shoulder.

03:44.572 --> 03:47.139
Mmm.Mmm.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.054
You sure about that?

03:49.229 --> 03:50.404
Your move.

04:00.327 --> 04:01.850
What?

04:02.024 --> 04:03.765
King.All right.

04:03.939 --> 04:05.332
That'’s two out of three.

04:06.985 --> 04:09.510
Okay, you are a winner.

04:11.207 --> 04:12.687
Then why am I here?

04:17.387 --> 04:20.172
Dad, I want to go home.

04:24.133 --> 04:26.135
I know. I know.
I'’m sorry.

04:26.309 --> 04:29.138
Look, everything'’s
going to be okay.

04:29.312 --> 04:30.705
It'’s not gonna be okay.

04:33.185 --> 04:36.101
Listen, right now this is--

04:36.276 --> 04:37.886
this is where
you have to be, okay?

04:38.060 --> 04:40.018
You have to be here
until you get better.

04:40.932 --> 04:43.457
Dad, it'’s not gonna work.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.372
Don'’t you get it?

04:45.546 --> 04:46.938
I am working on it.

04:47.112 --> 04:49.332
You can'’t stop things
from happening.

04:49.941 --> 04:50.942
Stop.

04:51.769 --> 04:53.423
You can'’t save me.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.599
I don'’t need you.

04:55.773 --> 04:57.906
You weren'’t there for Mom
when she needed you.

04:58.950 --> 05:01.344
Stop it, okay?
Stop, please.

05:01.518 --> 05:03.215
What exactly
do you want me to say?

05:03.390 --> 05:05.435
That it'’s my fault
that she'’s gone?

05:05.609 --> 05:07.350
Fine.

05:07.524 --> 05:09.700
But I am not gonna
lose my daughter.

05:10.658 --> 05:12.268
It'’s just not gonna happen.

05:13.835 --> 05:16.228
Dad, just leave.

05:16.403 --> 05:18.666
No. No, I'’m not giving up.

05:19.449 --> 05:21.103
You can'’t help.

05:21.277 --> 05:23.061
There are other treatments,
Emma.

05:25.542 --> 05:27.327
Please leave.

05:28.197 --> 05:29.677
I wanna be alone.

05:36.205 --> 05:40.818
Emma, please do not
give up on me.

05:41.732 --> 05:43.081
Hmm?

05:43.255 --> 05:45.562
I'’m just tired.

05:45.736 --> 05:46.737
Go.

06:12.284 --> 06:13.198
Excuse me.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.765
Excuse me.
Mr. Gibson?

06:14.939 --> 06:16.027
Mr. Gibson.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.076
Yeah.

06:24.775 --> 06:27.125
I will have your money,
I promise.

06:27.299 --> 06:29.780
If it were up to me,
she could stay
as long as she wants.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.434
I appreciate it.

07:11.169 --> 07:14.608
It'’s there. I saw
a couple of Valenti'’s guys
in there this morning.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.219
You sure?

07:17.393 --> 07:19.656
Yeah, a guy named Cameron,
their lawyer.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.397
They insured it
for a lot of money.

07:21.571 --> 07:23.530
I was the one
who arranged the insurance.

07:25.401 --> 07:27.055
Okay, so this is legit.

07:28.317 --> 07:30.580
The seed phrase is in there
with the thumb drives.

07:30.754 --> 07:32.016
You better hurry though.

07:33.104 --> 07:34.105
And why is that?

07:36.020 --> 07:38.458
Armored car
is gonna pick it up
in a few days.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.071
What about our buyer?

07:43.724 --> 07:44.812
All set.

07:49.817 --> 07:51.079
Ooh! Eh?

07:51.253 --> 07:52.297
No, I'’m good.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.169
Suit yourself.

08:01.393 --> 08:04.222
So this guy, uh,
you'’re sure about him?

08:04.396 --> 08:06.660
Yeah, you can come in
and meet him right now,
if you want.

08:06.834 --> 08:09.140
Been playing poker
with him once a week.
He'’s a whale.

08:09.314 --> 08:11.316
No, no, no.
It'’s better if I don'’t.

08:15.799 --> 08:19.455
He'’s not too happy
with me now anyways.
I owe him a ton of money.

08:20.717 --> 08:21.631
Wait, no tip?

08:21.805 --> 08:23.633
You'’ll get it soon enough.

08:33.687 --> 08:34.688
Okay.

08:46.961 --> 08:48.092
Hey.

08:55.186 --> 08:57.580
These guys really
stuck it to me.
Can'’t believe I fell for it.

08:57.754 --> 08:59.234
We'’re all set.

08:59.408 --> 09:01.541
It was
supposed to be
for collateral.

09:04.369 --> 09:06.633
These guys
are still holding on
to my property.

09:06.807 --> 09:08.809
Pricks. They want me
to keep paying.

09:14.989 --> 09:16.120
Merde.

10:16.964 --> 10:17.965
Hey, Nick.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.447
So you own this place?

10:23.100 --> 10:24.319
More or less.

10:27.191 --> 10:30.804
You can sign up for
an annual contract,
or monthly.

10:30.978 --> 10:32.719
It'’s cheaper
to do the annual.

10:32.893 --> 10:34.851
But that means
you have to
make a commitment.

10:36.157 --> 10:39.595
Ah, funny. Funny.
But that was
a long time ago.

10:45.253 --> 10:47.255
Still got that
sense of humor, huh?

11:02.400 --> 11:03.488
So...

11:05.926 --> 11:08.276
do you think Jack
would be interested
in this?

11:09.538 --> 11:11.671
I mean,
it'’s 500 grand for Jack.

11:12.628 --> 11:13.760
And plus,

11:13.934 --> 11:15.892
more for your guys--
his guys, I guess.

11:16.066 --> 11:17.589
And for you.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.419
I actually can'’t do this
without a crew.

11:21.593 --> 11:23.508
It'’s good to see you too.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.817
You doing this for Emma?

11:27.991 --> 11:29.297
Yeah.

11:29.471 --> 11:31.952
There'’s an experimental
procedure in LA,

11:32.126 --> 11:34.868
but insurance
won'’t cover it, so...

11:36.696 --> 11:38.175
I'’m sorry.

11:39.394 --> 11:40.787
I'’ll see what I can do.

11:41.396 --> 11:42.745
I'’ll talk to him.

11:49.534 --> 11:50.710
All right.

11:52.494 --> 11:53.582
Uh--

11:55.323 --> 11:56.759
Funny, huh?

12:03.200 --> 12:04.549
Where did you find this?

12:05.768 --> 12:07.639
Figured you'’d want it back.

12:12.122 --> 12:13.297
Keep it.

12:15.473 --> 12:16.997
Thank you.

13:08.004 --> 13:11.529
Business is slow,
but I'’m making my payments.
You'’ll get your money.

13:23.672 --> 13:26.675
It'’s a hundred K.
It'’ll take ten years
at this rate.

13:30.374 --> 13:32.637
There is a way
I could get you
a bigger payment.

13:33.987 --> 13:35.771
I have a connection
to a job,

13:36.859 --> 13:39.209
but only if it means
I'’m out of our deal.

13:40.907 --> 13:41.908
Okay?

13:42.473 --> 13:43.648
Paid in full.

14:26.996 --> 14:28.476
Hey, Jim.

14:28.650 --> 14:30.434
Yeah, no,
I got your messages.

14:34.090 --> 14:36.005
Really? Um--

14:36.179 --> 14:37.746
That can'’t be right.
I'’m--

14:37.920 --> 14:40.053
I'’m pretty sure
I already sent
the check in.

14:40.227 --> 14:42.664
Okay. Okay, fine.

14:42.838 --> 14:46.146
Fine. Yeah, no, I will, uh--
I'’ll look into it.

14:47.190 --> 14:49.366
And I'’ll get back to you
as soon as I can.

14:50.541 --> 14:51.586
Okay.

14:52.804 --> 14:53.849
Fuck.

14:59.115 --> 15:03.032
We can'’t move in
until the bank manager leaves.

15:03.206 --> 15:06.731
Fortunately for us,
every weekday at- 30,

15:06.906 --> 15:09.821
she leaves to pick up
her kid from school, okay?

15:09.996 --> 15:11.693
So that'’ll be
our window right here.

15:11.867 --> 15:12.912
- 30.

15:13.608 --> 15:15.262
Twenty minutes.

15:15.436 --> 15:18.439
Once Jack gets everyone inside,
you'’ll need my contact.

15:19.092 --> 15:21.007
This is Ryan.

15:21.181 --> 15:23.139
He'’s the assistant
branch manager.

15:24.488 --> 15:26.838
He'’ll have the keys to
the boxes and the vault.

15:27.448 --> 15:28.928
Now,

15:29.102 --> 15:31.495
you can push him around
a little,

15:31.669 --> 15:33.193
but only a little.

15:34.324 --> 15:36.457
Okay, it'’s just for show.

15:36.631 --> 15:38.676
Why would we do that
if he'’s your contact?

15:38.850 --> 15:42.506
Because the idea here
is to make this look like
a messy amateur job.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.119
Thank you.

15:46.858 --> 15:48.599
Now,

15:48.773 --> 15:51.515
once you have his keys,
you can get the boxes open

15:51.689 --> 15:54.518
despite not having
the customers'’ keys as well,
correct?

15:54.692 --> 15:57.434
I can get the boxes open.
I don'’t need the keys.

15:57.608 --> 16:00.263
It won'’t be pretty,
but I can get them open.

16:01.177 --> 16:02.178
That'’s good.
That'’s good.

16:02.352 --> 16:04.702
The uglier, the better.
All right?

16:04.876 --> 16:07.183
You wanna focus
on the larger boxes,
all right,

16:07.357 --> 16:09.272
on the left side
of the wall, here.

16:10.491 --> 16:11.883
Box 23.

16:13.798 --> 16:15.583
That is our box.

16:15.757 --> 16:19.152
And inside,
you will find this briefcase.

16:20.501 --> 16:22.764
Feel free to hit
as many boxes as you can,

16:22.938 --> 16:25.723
but Jack will handle box 23.

16:27.116 --> 16:29.292
Whatever'’s in
the other boxes and--

16:29.466 --> 16:33.383
and whatever cash
is in the vault,
that'’s all yours.

16:33.557 --> 16:35.168
So what'’s in that case?

16:38.214 --> 16:40.390
None of your fucking business.

16:40.564 --> 16:43.524
There'’ll be plenty of cash
in the vault
and the other boxes. Got it?

16:47.876 --> 16:49.704
Who'’s this
mousy little freak?

16:49.878 --> 16:51.662
Shit. Right.

16:51.836 --> 16:52.968
This is Xander.

16:53.142 --> 16:54.535
He'’ll be remote.

16:54.709 --> 16:57.886
He'’s gonna monitor cameras,
intercept alarms,

16:58.060 --> 16:59.409
listen for cops.

17:00.715 --> 17:02.630
No one gets hurt.

17:02.804 --> 17:06.808
Are you running this job, Jack?
Or is he?

17:09.245 --> 17:12.596
You listen to me.
I'’m running this job.

17:12.770 --> 17:15.121
It'’s the last time
I'’m gonna tell you,
'’cause I don'’t have time

17:15.295 --> 17:16.861
to trade your ass out.

17:17.775 --> 17:20.604
I'’m running you.
You understand?

17:29.135 --> 17:31.224
People will be
looking for that case.

17:31.398 --> 17:33.617
And for you, okay?

17:33.791 --> 17:35.750
We start
really hurting people,

17:35.924 --> 17:38.753
the cops are gonna take
a keen interest as well.

17:38.927 --> 17:40.798
It'’s just heat we don'’t need.

17:40.972 --> 17:42.844
That'’s one way
to look at it.

17:43.018 --> 17:45.151
Sometimes
things happen in there.

17:46.848 --> 17:48.067
Not this time.

17:49.590 --> 17:51.809
We do the job, we leave.

17:51.983 --> 17:56.814
Feds lose interest
and think that some amateur
made a mess and got lucky.

17:56.988 --> 18:00.470
Okay, they might be looking,
just not for us.

18:01.558 --> 18:04.213
Listen, fellas,
we do this right,

18:04.387 --> 18:07.651
there'’s a fat payday
and everyone gets their share.

18:09.740 --> 18:11.568
Okay. We cool?

18:13.222 --> 18:14.528
All right.

18:27.497 --> 18:28.585
That'’s crap.

18:29.543 --> 18:31.327
How much you think
Jack'’s getting?

18:31.501 --> 18:33.503
I never done a job
where we didn'’t know
how much the take is.

18:33.677 --> 18:36.115
This shit don'’t feel right.

18:52.870 --> 18:55.786
No, don'’t worry about him.
All right?

18:57.353 --> 18:58.833
His dad looked after me
in prison,

18:59.007 --> 19:02.445
and so I promised him
that I would look after his son

19:02.619 --> 19:04.055
when I got out.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.231
That'’s it.

19:06.275 --> 19:09.017
Plus, he'’s got skills.

19:10.975 --> 19:13.413
Did you get
the buyer info I sent you?Yeah.

19:13.587 --> 19:14.544
Okay.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.156
Five days is a long time
to lay low

19:17.330 --> 19:19.027
before we make the sale.

19:21.203 --> 19:23.074
The exchange
is person-to-person.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.207
I already confirmed
the date and time
with the buyer.

19:25.381 --> 19:27.644
Changing it now,
that would just--Nah.

19:28.819 --> 19:29.994
Leave it.

19:31.126 --> 19:32.606
But I'’m gonna need
some insurance

19:32.780 --> 19:35.261
so things fly straight
after the bank.

19:37.698 --> 19:38.699
No problem.

19:53.888 --> 19:55.324
Standing by.

19:56.717 --> 19:57.718
Copy that.

20:02.375 --> 20:03.637
- 30.

20:10.818 --> 20:13.168
Bingo, there she is.

20:14.343 --> 20:15.605
Right on time.

20:16.954 --> 20:17.999
Xander,

20:19.000 --> 20:20.349
start the feed.

20:21.916 --> 20:23.004
Copy that.

20:24.005 --> 20:28.879
New feed starting
in three, two, one.

20:29.053 --> 20:31.708
Yeah, copy that.Feed is live,
clock is running.

20:32.666 --> 20:34.058
All right,
let'’s dance.

20:34.885 --> 20:36.060
Stick to the plan.

20:42.066 --> 20:43.546
Everybody on the floor now!

20:43.720 --> 20:45.287
Oh, God!Get back!

20:45.461 --> 20:48.377
Heads down, right now!

20:48.551 --> 20:51.250
Get down, get down!

20:51.424 --> 20:53.948
Open the door.Keep your head down!

20:54.122 --> 20:56.167
Open the door.

20:56.342 --> 20:58.605
You wanna die?Head down, right now!

20:58.779 --> 21:01.390
Shut your mouth.
What are you looking at? Huh?

21:01.564 --> 21:02.565
Get the fuck back!

21:11.226 --> 21:13.054
Hurry. Open the door.
Come on.

21:13.228 --> 21:14.795
Stay the fuck down!

21:15.926 --> 21:17.580
Don'’t be a hero.

21:22.585 --> 21:24.021
Shut up.

21:24.195 --> 21:25.719
You do not look at me, okay?

21:25.893 --> 21:27.416
Don'’t fucking look at me!

21:29.070 --> 21:30.680
Where'’s the key
to the boxes?

21:30.854 --> 21:32.160
They won'’t work.

21:33.683 --> 21:35.119
I'’m not asking ya.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.947
Give me the keys.
Good boy.

21:40.342 --> 21:41.604
Stay down!

22:05.846 --> 22:07.674
Back in the lobby
with the rest of them. Go.

22:07.848 --> 22:09.458
Manager'’s coming out!

22:10.198 --> 22:11.460
Get over here.

22:11.634 --> 22:13.462
Get down! Stay right there!

22:13.636 --> 22:15.508
I hear anything out of you,
I won'’t think twice

22:15.682 --> 22:17.553
about putting a bullet
through your skull!

22:30.871 --> 22:31.915
Box 23.

22:43.187 --> 22:44.188
Let'’s move.

22:48.323 --> 22:49.933
Don'’t you fucking look at me!

23:08.996 --> 23:11.520
Don'’t fucking look at me!

23:17.178 --> 23:19.093
Stay down! Stay down!

23:19.267 --> 23:20.573
Four minutes.
Let'’s go.

23:29.146 --> 23:30.452
No.

23:31.671 --> 23:32.672
Let'’s go.

23:39.853 --> 23:41.332
Faces down!

23:46.816 --> 23:48.992
I said stay down!
Head down!

23:49.689 --> 23:50.777
Come on!Hey.

23:50.951 --> 23:52.518
What are you doing?No! No.

23:52.692 --> 23:53.780
Hey.

23:53.954 --> 23:55.216
Stop! Come on.

24:01.004 --> 24:02.179
Where the hell is he?

24:07.663 --> 24:09.056
Hey, what the hell, man?

24:09.926 --> 24:11.275
Hey, we'’re all set.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.626
Yo, hey, what is this?

24:27.901 --> 24:30.425
What the hell
were you doing in there?
Huh?

24:34.255 --> 24:36.910
Show me your hands!Show me your hands!

24:37.084 --> 24:38.738
Hands up! Hands up!

24:38.912 --> 24:40.043
All clear.

24:40.217 --> 24:42.219
HQ, we'’ve got
the wrong location.

24:44.178 --> 24:46.702
Whoo!

24:46.876 --> 24:49.052
That'’s why they call me
the Xan Man.

24:49.226 --> 24:51.054
That'’s the B-I-G X-A-N.

24:56.016 --> 24:57.408
Yes!Yeah!

24:57.583 --> 25:01.151
We did it, guys!
Yeah!Fuck yeah!

25:01.325 --> 25:02.849
Goddamn!

25:03.023 --> 25:04.503
Nobody following us.
We'’re free and clear.

25:04.677 --> 25:06.505
Oh, my God.
You gotta see this thing.

25:06.679 --> 25:08.245
Whoo!Hell yeah.

25:11.335 --> 25:12.511
Hell yeah.

25:22.869 --> 25:25.001
Hey, look at that.
You like it?

25:26.699 --> 25:28.091
See what you can do.

25:35.621 --> 25:37.100
I could'’ve done that.

25:43.324 --> 25:47.197
Hey, hey, hey.
You guys knew the deal.

25:47.371 --> 25:49.722
You guys keep the cash
and whatever else you can find,

25:49.896 --> 25:51.637
but not this.

25:59.775 --> 26:01.995
There'’s 500 grand
on that thing.

26:02.169 --> 26:03.344
Don'’t lose it.

26:10.394 --> 26:12.222
All right, well,
stick with the plan.

26:12.396 --> 26:15.443
Can'’t have you guys
out running around like idiots.

26:15.617 --> 26:20.187
Wait a few days,
and we all get our cut.
All right?

26:21.405 --> 26:22.711
We cool?

26:22.885 --> 26:24.104
Here'’s a little taste.

26:30.676 --> 26:31.851
Yes.

27:54.237 --> 27:55.369
What the...

28:22.135 --> 28:23.832
Let'’s go!

28:28.663 --> 28:31.231
Fuck him. Come on, guys.
We gotta go!

29:46.219 --> 29:47.394
Sir, can you hear me?

29:52.051 --> 29:55.141
You know,
there was cops
already here, okay?

29:56.577 --> 29:58.797
I told them
everything that I knew.

30:00.407 --> 30:02.626
Mr. Thompson?

30:02.801 --> 30:06.152
Look, like I said, right?

30:06.326 --> 30:07.675
Well, I had...

30:08.763 --> 30:11.810
I checked my tire,
had a flat,

30:11.984 --> 30:14.029
and then someone
tapped me on the shoulder.

30:16.597 --> 30:18.033
That'’s it.
That'’s all I remember.

30:19.382 --> 30:20.906
All right.

30:21.080 --> 30:24.431
Well, feel free to call us
if any details come to mind.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.041
Yep.

30:30.480 --> 30:31.525
Okay.

30:51.153 --> 30:52.851
He'’s hiding something.

30:53.025 --> 30:55.810
Yeah, most ride-share
drivers are scammers
anyway, you know?

30:55.984 --> 30:59.335
Working with fake IDs,
primarily for the strip clubs,
bringing them customers.

30:59.509 --> 31:01.685
Maybe he just doesn'’t
want us to know about it.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.470
Hold on.

31:04.906 --> 31:06.865
Hey, Reed.
It'’s Cooper.

31:08.605 --> 31:10.259
Yeah, do me a favor.

31:15.090 --> 31:16.004
Hey.Hey.

31:16.178 --> 31:17.527
Is everything okay?Yeah.

31:17.701 --> 31:19.138
I need to use the bathroom.

31:19.312 --> 31:20.400
All right, here.

31:21.227 --> 31:22.881
Hang on to this.Okay.

31:27.494 --> 31:29.931
Yeah.All right, let'’s go.

31:30.105 --> 31:32.673
Actually,
I think I can
manage from here.

31:32.847 --> 31:34.109
You got it?Yeah.

31:34.283 --> 31:36.590
I might be a minute,
if you know what I mean.

32:14.802 --> 32:17.022
That shit'’s gonna
make you stupid.

32:21.504 --> 32:23.115
I told you
not to call.

32:26.553 --> 32:29.643
Every time
we talk to each other,
it'’s a risk we don'’t need.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.167
I haven'’t heard about Nick.

32:32.341 --> 32:35.257
Well, if they
found his body,
it'’d be out by now.

32:39.131 --> 32:41.872
You sure?
You don'’t sound sure.

32:43.526 --> 32:44.614
Then what?

32:46.529 --> 32:48.662
That wasn'’t
part of the agreement.

32:48.836 --> 32:51.795
Like I said,
50K to do Nick.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.973
You don'’t get paid
till I sell the case.
That'’s it.

32:56.017 --> 32:58.106
What are you saying, Jerry?

32:58.280 --> 33:00.630
You'’re trying to hold out?
Is that a threat?

33:02.806 --> 33:04.678
You better think about
how you answer.

33:05.984 --> 33:06.897
Listen to me.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.682
I have the leverage, Jack.

33:08.856 --> 33:12.033
Either you get me the money
or I'’m not showing up.

33:12.207 --> 33:14.427
You'’re gonna screw
this whole deal.

33:14.601 --> 33:18.039
The buyer is ready.
There'’s nothing
I can do about that.

33:18.213 --> 33:19.475
Guaranteed money.

33:19.649 --> 33:21.869
I want Nick'’s share,
and that'’s it.

33:22.043 --> 33:24.698
I'’m not budging.
You figure it out.

33:24.872 --> 33:28.876
I will text you
when it'’s time
to get your cash.

33:33.620 --> 33:35.187
Hello?

33:35.752 --> 33:37.015
Hello?

33:48.678 --> 33:50.202
Willis,

33:50.376 --> 33:52.856
I need you to do me a favor.

34:32.940 --> 34:33.984
Thank you.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.713
Can I help you?

35:50.887 --> 35:52.889
Uh, yeah.
I'’m looking for
Emma Gibson'’s room.

35:53.063 --> 35:54.064
Are you a relative?

35:54.239 --> 35:57.198
No, a friend of the family.

35:57.372 --> 36:00.070
Oh, I'’m sorry, sir.
No visitors.

36:00.245 --> 36:02.464
Only immediate
family allowed.

36:02.638 --> 36:04.074
Can I give those to her?

36:04.249 --> 36:08.253
Could you?
That'’d be great.
Thanks so much.

36:08.427 --> 36:11.299
Can we give these to her
after her MRI?

36:38.283 --> 36:41.199
Hi, Emma.
Uncle Willis says hello.

36:48.684 --> 36:49.772
Dad.

36:51.861 --> 36:52.906
Hey.

36:55.038 --> 36:56.997
I'’m gonna get you
outta here soon.

36:57.171 --> 37:00.870
Where have you been
these days anyway?

37:01.044 --> 37:03.046
Don'’t worry.Why are you
dressed like that?

37:05.179 --> 37:07.834
Don'’t tell me.
I don'’t wanna know.

37:08.574 --> 37:09.923
Don'’t worry about it.

37:13.187 --> 37:14.232
Here.

37:33.903 --> 37:35.731
I'’m gonna be back, okay?

37:52.052 --> 37:53.358
You call for a ride?

37:56.361 --> 37:57.405
I got you.

37:58.319 --> 38:00.278
Let'’s get the hell
outta here.

38:07.633 --> 38:09.330
I never trusted those guys.

38:10.244 --> 38:11.550
Got you some clothes.

38:12.942 --> 38:14.770
You think Jack
and Veronica are in on it?

38:17.164 --> 38:19.209
Is there something we can do
in the blockchain?

38:19.384 --> 38:21.211
Or, I don'’t know, uh--

38:21.386 --> 38:24.171
Get the transaction reversed
or get it back?

38:24.345 --> 38:26.086
We can'’t do anything
without the drives.

38:26.260 --> 38:29.132
Without the seed phrase,
it'’s impossible to access them.

38:29.307 --> 38:32.222
I'’m gonna get it back.
All of it.

38:37.140 --> 38:39.708
What? What'’s that?Got a great deal on Amazon.

38:39.882 --> 38:41.667
You'’re gonna need it.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.331
Damn.

38:54.984 --> 38:55.985
Looks pretty bad.

38:59.119 --> 39:03.123
Look, I need you to go back
to the hospital.
To keep an eye out.

39:04.777 --> 39:07.127
Okay, yeah.
I'’ll take care of Emma.

39:16.484 --> 39:19.400
Okay, here'’s the footage
from before the robbery,
on the cloud.

39:20.793 --> 39:22.490
The on-site hard drives
were destroyed.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.928
What time is this?This is- 29.

39:26.886 --> 39:28.757
Who'’s that?Bank manager.

39:30.411 --> 39:32.239
And the robbery starts...

39:32.413 --> 39:35.938
Just after- 30,
right around here.

39:38.332 --> 39:39.333
Nothing.

39:40.421 --> 39:41.727
It'’s a fake feed.Yep.

39:41.901 --> 39:43.076
Now, quick, go back.

39:47.167 --> 39:48.298
That'’s the cut point.

39:49.561 --> 39:51.954
And that'’s where
the robbery starts.

39:52.128 --> 39:54.827
And they switched the feed
as it uploaded to the cloud.

39:57.264 --> 39:59.788
This ain'’t no smash and grab.
They'’re pros.

39:59.962 --> 40:01.964
You have any other footage
from outside the business?

40:02.138 --> 40:03.618
Yes.

40:09.407 --> 40:10.451
There it is.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.454
Any plates?

40:13.628 --> 40:14.847
They knew where
the cameras were.

40:15.021 --> 40:16.501
Only a partial.
We'’re running it now.

40:16.675 --> 40:20.026
Okay. Call us
when something comes in.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.594
Let'’s go see what'’s up
with those safety deposit boxes.

40:22.768 --> 40:23.856
Thanks, Reed.

40:53.015 --> 40:56.018
No.

41:47.896 --> 41:50.377
Where is it, huh?

41:50.551 --> 41:53.249
Hey, asshole,
where is my goddamn case?

41:53.423 --> 41:56.339
It wasn'’t me.
Jack! It was Jack.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.341
All right, where is he?
Hmm?

41:58.516 --> 41:59.691
Screw you.

41:59.865 --> 42:02.128
Where the hell is he, huh?

42:05.044 --> 42:06.393
Where is he?

42:07.089 --> 42:08.003
Where is he?

42:12.747 --> 42:15.315
I don'’t know!
I don'’t know!

42:15.489 --> 42:17.622
He said he was
gonna cut us a deal, okay?

42:17.796 --> 42:19.058
He said
we were gonna get a cut.

42:19.232 --> 42:21.190
I don'’t know where he is,
I swear!

42:21.364 --> 42:24.106
All I know is he'’s hanging out
with that coked-up whore.

42:33.376 --> 42:34.769
You know what?

42:34.943 --> 42:38.556
Never go near
my daughter again!
You hear me?

42:38.730 --> 42:40.558
Do you fucking hear me?

42:40.732 --> 42:43.648
Uncle Willis says hello.Do you hear me, asshole? Huh?

42:43.822 --> 42:46.912
Uncle Willis--
Uncle-- Uncle-- Uncle--
Uncle-- Uncle--

42:48.696 --> 42:50.568
Uncle Willis--

42:50.742 --> 42:52.221
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

42:52.395 --> 42:54.223
Willis.
Hey, hey, hey!

42:56.095 --> 42:57.096
Willis?

43:04.277 --> 43:06.322
Goddamn it, man.

43:09.369 --> 43:12.241
Piece of shit.
Goddamn it, man.

43:44.143 --> 43:45.187
Nick.

43:46.624 --> 43:47.842
How you doing?

43:48.016 --> 43:49.148
You know.

43:49.322 --> 43:51.280
Oh, shit.
That doesn'’t look good.

43:53.065 --> 43:54.675
I'’m-- I'’m not doing
that sort of stuff
anymore.

43:54.849 --> 43:56.024
My-- My eyes are--

43:56.198 --> 43:57.591
I just can'’t--

43:57.765 --> 43:59.114
I see that.

44:03.771 --> 44:05.773
Oh, shit.
Let me get this
out of your way.

44:05.947 --> 44:07.470
I'’m gonna have you
sit right there.

44:08.036 --> 44:09.211
There you go.

44:10.169 --> 44:13.259
All right, I got, uh--
Let'’s see.

44:13.433 --> 44:15.043
Let me get this
bag over here.

44:15.217 --> 44:16.566
I got a clean sheet.

44:17.655 --> 44:18.917
I think this will work.

44:20.701 --> 44:23.182
Oh, man.Yep, it'’s clean.

44:25.619 --> 44:27.055
There you go.

44:27.229 --> 44:29.231
All right, let'’s see.

44:31.625 --> 44:32.757
Okay, good.

44:36.412 --> 44:38.719
All right,
looks like you got
two wounds.

44:38.893 --> 44:39.894
Right?

44:40.068 --> 44:41.896
Yep.All right.

44:42.070 --> 44:44.725
Looks like you
had a collision
with some lead.

44:45.639 --> 44:47.380
Yeah, you could say that.Yeah.

44:48.642 --> 44:50.992
I got bad news for you.
The sutures have come undone.

44:51.166 --> 44:53.125
You'’re losing
a lot of blood back here.

44:54.343 --> 44:55.649
Any problems
with your breathing?

44:55.823 --> 44:57.520
No, no.Okay.

44:58.304 --> 44:59.653
I'’m gonna have to--

44:59.827 --> 45:01.089
I'’m gonna have to
clean this up.

45:01.263 --> 45:02.874
This is gonna sting
a little bit.

45:03.048 --> 45:04.832
But I gotta see
what I'’m doing back here,
all right?

45:05.006 --> 45:06.007
Mm-hmm.

45:07.095 --> 45:09.663
Fuck, yeah.

45:09.837 --> 45:12.535
All right, let me see
if I have a clean needle here.

45:12.710 --> 45:14.450
No, I'’m just kidding.

45:14.624 --> 45:16.844
Despite what
the state of Nevada says,

45:17.018 --> 45:20.195
I am a very capable
physician.

45:20.369 --> 45:22.371
This is gonna help.
I don'’t have anything really
for pain.

45:22.545 --> 45:25.026
I got this--
I got this numbing gel.

45:26.288 --> 45:28.900
Works on the gums
pretty good.

45:31.554 --> 45:34.732
You ready? This is gonna--
This is gonna hurt,
'’cause this is the first poke.

45:34.906 --> 45:36.646
Okay.

45:36.821 --> 45:38.083
You all right?Yeah.

45:41.913 --> 45:44.176
Just about done.

45:46.308 --> 45:47.396
All right.

45:48.310 --> 45:50.573
Whew. Uh--

45:50.748 --> 45:54.752
You want some, uh--
I might have some pills
for some pain, right here.

45:56.362 --> 45:57.711
Use only as directed.

45:59.017 --> 46:01.628
These look old and expired.

46:02.237 --> 46:03.369
They still work?

46:03.543 --> 46:05.458
Well, they work
pretty good for me.

46:06.981 --> 46:08.809
I just wanna
finish that beer.Mmm.

46:08.983 --> 46:09.984
You want one?

46:11.159 --> 46:13.118
Sure.Take mine.

46:19.994 --> 46:23.432
Hey, boss,
that van that we found,
it was stolen.

46:23.606 --> 46:25.652
The partial
license plate matches.

46:25.826 --> 46:27.349
Any prints?So far nothing.

46:29.830 --> 46:30.831
Cooper.

46:33.660 --> 46:34.748
Uh-huh.

46:36.010 --> 46:37.577
Is that right?

46:37.751 --> 46:39.797
Okay.
Yeah, you got it.

46:40.449 --> 46:41.537
Thanks.

46:41.711 --> 46:43.888
A lawyer named Cameron
just called.

46:44.062 --> 46:46.499
Owner of one of
the safety deposit boxes.

46:46.673 --> 46:50.285
Filed for a missing item.
It'’s insured for a lot of money.
This guy'’s making a claim.

47:21.795 --> 47:22.796
Can I help you?

47:22.970 --> 47:25.581
Yes. Mr. Gibson
for Mr. Cameron.

47:27.453 --> 47:30.282
I have some information
for him.Regarding?

47:30.456 --> 47:32.414
Something of his
that was recently stolen.

47:38.986 --> 47:41.206
Yeah, we have a guy
that'’s waiting for him.

47:43.164 --> 47:44.165
Okay.

47:45.732 --> 47:46.864
Follow me.

48:01.922 --> 48:03.881
Mr. Gibson,
how can I help you?

48:06.013 --> 48:07.580
All right, well, um...

48:09.756 --> 48:12.628
kinda hoping that we can--
we can help each other.

48:13.412 --> 48:14.456
I, uh--

48:14.630 --> 48:17.503
I have information
about that item

48:17.677 --> 48:19.679
that was stolen
from one of your clients.

48:21.376 --> 48:25.424
Yeah, but it needs to be
presented directly
to Mr. Valenti.

48:25.598 --> 48:28.427
My client list
is strictly confidential,
Mr. Gibson.

48:28.601 --> 48:32.126
Even if I had a client
with that name,
I wouldn'’t discuss it with you.

48:33.345 --> 48:34.389
Okay.

48:35.651 --> 48:37.218
Okay. Never mind then.

48:37.392 --> 48:38.567
Um--

48:39.394 --> 48:41.135
Appreciate your time.

48:44.617 --> 48:48.273
You know, I really hope
that what I have to say

48:48.447 --> 48:52.103
does not reach Mr. Valenti
from someone else, you know?

48:55.019 --> 48:57.369
All right, wait.
Close the door.

48:59.197 --> 49:02.374
I don'’t know who
you think you are
or what game you'’re playing at,

49:02.548 --> 49:04.463
but be at this address.

49:04.637 --> 49:08.162
Call this number in one hour.
You'’ll receive
further instructions.

49:10.991 --> 49:14.386
But be careful, Mr. Gibson.
Be very, very careful.

50:04.349 --> 50:07.221
I hope you'’re here
to report progress
in recovering our property.

50:07.395 --> 50:09.049
The investigation'’s
developing.

50:09.223 --> 50:11.051
How are you
related to the item?

50:11.225 --> 50:13.314
My firm represents
the holding company
that owns it.

50:13.488 --> 50:16.100
They operate outside the US,
and we'’re registered to act
as their agent here,

50:16.274 --> 50:20.408
so when we learned of the loss,
we reported it as their agent.

50:20.582 --> 50:22.149
And what'’s
the holding company again?

50:22.323 --> 50:25.457
Argenti International.
Have you heard of it?Yes.

50:25.631 --> 50:28.982
Probably read our write-up
in The Wall Street Journal.Actually, no.

50:29.156 --> 50:32.333
I saw Interpol reports
on front companies
for mob families.

50:32.507 --> 50:36.120
You must have confused
Argenti with some other
less-reputable company.

50:36.294 --> 50:38.557
I assure you,
we'’re a perfectly legitimate
holding company.

50:38.731 --> 50:41.255
We specialize in global
real estate ventures.

50:41.429 --> 50:44.302
So, would you mind telling us
what the item was
that you insured?

50:44.476 --> 50:45.912
Not at all, Mr....

50:46.086 --> 50:47.870
Agent Cooper.
Owens.

50:48.697 --> 50:50.047
Cryptocurrency.

50:50.221 --> 50:52.179
And how much
was it insured for?

50:52.353 --> 50:54.790
An amount equal
to its current market value,
around two million dollars.

50:58.272 --> 50:59.969
If there'’s nothing else
I can assist
you gentlemen with,

51:00.144 --> 51:01.754
I have an important
conference call
to attend to.

51:01.928 --> 51:04.235
We'’ll be in touch.
Thank you.

51:10.719 --> 51:11.894
So what do you think?

51:12.069 --> 51:14.332
Two million?Yeah.

51:14.506 --> 51:16.986
No wonder these guys don'’t
wanna scan the neighborhood
to find out what happened.

51:17.161 --> 51:19.032
They wanna claim insurance.

51:32.698 --> 51:33.873
Thanks, man.

51:44.536 --> 51:45.537
Shit.

51:51.717 --> 51:55.199
Yeah, no. I was told
to call this number
in an hour.

51:58.245 --> 51:59.246
Lamp store?

52:12.781 --> 52:14.653
Okay, thanks.

52:14.827 --> 52:17.830
Seems our ride-share driver
wasn'’t as bad off as we thought.

52:18.004 --> 52:20.659
Hospital called.
This guy checked
himself out early.

52:20.833 --> 52:23.749
That'’s not
a normal thing to do.Apparently, right after we left.

52:23.923 --> 52:26.012
We'’ll look a little deeper.Have Reed run
his name again.

52:26.186 --> 52:28.797
Have her really run it,
see what she comes up with.Copy that.

52:30.016 --> 52:31.060
Hi, guys.

52:32.453 --> 52:35.674
So, Mr. Gibson,
you have something
you wanna tell us?

52:37.066 --> 52:39.243
Where is Mr. Valenti? Hmm?

52:40.461 --> 52:41.810
Do you believe this guy?

52:43.072 --> 52:45.292
Let me tell you something,
wiseass.

52:45.466 --> 52:48.469
The only reason
you'’re not spitting out
your teeth right now

52:48.643 --> 52:51.080
is I was told to listen
to what you had to say.

52:51.994 --> 52:54.214
You don'’t talk
to Mr. Valenti.

52:55.737 --> 52:58.305
So you better start
telling me something
I wanna hear.

52:58.479 --> 53:02.483
I want Mr. Valenti to know
who robbed him and that
I can get it back for him.

53:02.657 --> 53:04.485
Don'’t mess with me,
jackass.

53:05.921 --> 53:07.749
Son of a--

53:07.923 --> 53:09.273
I wanna hear it for myself.

53:18.673 --> 53:23.809
Mr. Valenti,
I can get you your case
that was stolen from the bank.

53:25.027 --> 53:26.072
How?

53:27.682 --> 53:29.075
I was in on the robbery.

53:31.947 --> 53:34.515
Tell me why
I shouldn'’t drop you
here right now.

53:35.690 --> 53:37.431
Okay, okay.

53:38.563 --> 53:40.739
The assistant bank manager,
he was in on it.

53:40.913 --> 53:43.350
That'’s how
they knew it was there.

53:43.524 --> 53:47.311
Now he'’s dead,
but I know who has it.

53:48.660 --> 53:49.791
Really?Yeah.

53:49.965 --> 53:52.054
'’Cause they tried to
kill me too.

53:52.229 --> 53:55.232
So I see.
You need protection.

53:55.406 --> 53:57.277
Yeah, but...

53:57.451 --> 53:58.931
Mr. Valenti,

53:59.105 --> 54:02.369
I imagine that
you have this property
well insured.

54:03.414 --> 54:05.024
And if so,

54:05.198 --> 54:07.809
you'’re positioned right now
to collect on that.

54:07.983 --> 54:11.987
But what if you could
get the insurance money
and the case?

54:12.161 --> 54:14.729
Hmm?
I mean, that--

54:14.903 --> 54:16.383
That'’s win-win.

54:16.557 --> 54:19.299
And I'’m the only one
who can get it back for you.

54:20.996 --> 54:23.172
And if you don'’t succeed?

54:24.217 --> 54:26.132
You still collect
the insurance money.

54:28.352 --> 54:30.310
So I'’m sitting here, wondering,
why don'’t I have Pete here

54:30.484 --> 54:33.270
just break your fingers
one by one until you tell me
who has it?

54:34.619 --> 54:37.099
Because I can
get it back for you
a lot easier

54:37.274 --> 54:39.450
with all my fingers.

54:43.323 --> 54:45.586
You got some balls
on you.

54:45.760 --> 54:48.937
But you screw with us,
and I will feed them to you.
Do you understand me?

54:49.111 --> 54:50.330
Yeah.

54:50.504 --> 54:51.984
Whoa.

54:52.158 --> 54:53.420
Look, I need your guys'’ help.

54:59.470 --> 55:01.210
Let me see
if I got this straight.

55:01.385 --> 55:03.474
You steal from me,
they steal from you,

55:03.648 --> 55:07.042
and now you wanna
steal back from them
so you can give it to me?

55:07.216 --> 55:08.392
What'’s in it for you?

55:08.566 --> 55:10.132
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

55:17.792 --> 55:20.752
A procedure
for my daughter.

55:20.926 --> 55:22.188
She'’s very sick.

55:22.971 --> 55:24.321
So I get it.

55:24.495 --> 55:26.758
You want
what'’s coming to you.

55:26.932 --> 55:29.151
Fifteen percent
of about four million.

55:29.326 --> 55:30.718
500 grand?

55:33.634 --> 55:35.332
I'’m not gonna let her die.

55:45.342 --> 55:48.214
At ease, boys. Jesus.

55:56.527 --> 55:59.443
That'’s a lot of Eric Thompsons.Twenty-six in Nevada State.

55:59.617 --> 56:02.881
Any of them have a record?One. Breaking, entering
and forgery.

56:03.055 --> 56:04.535
Well, that'’s good.
Does he have an ID?

56:08.277 --> 56:09.627
Erica Thompson.

56:11.324 --> 56:13.631
None of us
could get a match either.No.

56:13.805 --> 56:15.937
And Ride said
he'’s squeaky clean.

56:16.111 --> 56:18.549
Been driving there six months,
just like he said.

56:20.115 --> 56:21.552
Okay, square one.

56:23.118 --> 56:24.642
This ain'’t working.
Let'’s get everyone together.

56:24.816 --> 56:26.208
We gotta
try something different.

56:28.341 --> 56:29.690
Okay, listen up.

56:30.865 --> 56:33.607
We need to cast
a wider net here.
All right?

56:33.781 --> 56:36.567
I wanna pull every assault
with a deadly weapon record,

56:36.741 --> 56:38.569
every robbery
within the last six months,

56:38.743 --> 56:42.137
every Snickers bar shoplifted
in the state of Nevada.
You with me?

56:42.311 --> 56:45.837
Then we need to pull
the vacation or sick days
of every employee

56:46.011 --> 56:49.362
working for the hotels,
local unions,
construction companies

56:49.536 --> 56:51.451
or whatever companies
we can get.

56:51.625 --> 56:54.062
And we need to cross-reference
those together for
the date of the robbery.

56:54.236 --> 56:57.936
And if anyone gets a hit,
or anything remotely
resembling a hit,

56:58.110 --> 56:59.764
you contact me
or you contact Owens.

56:59.938 --> 57:00.808
You got it?Got it.

57:00.982 --> 57:01.983
Let'’s go.

57:22.743 --> 57:26.051
What'’s with you guys
not following
simple instructions?

57:27.139 --> 57:28.445
Jack, Willis is dead.

57:28.619 --> 57:29.620
What?

57:33.275 --> 57:34.320
Where?

57:39.064 --> 57:40.195
How'’d it happen?

57:44.722 --> 57:46.941
You talk to any cops?

57:48.116 --> 57:49.814
Where'’s the case?

57:49.988 --> 57:51.946
Jerry has it at his place.

57:52.120 --> 57:54.471
Go get it now.

57:54.645 --> 57:56.908
Get the hell out of there
and don'’t go back.

57:59.040 --> 58:00.868
They will tie Willis
to you.

58:03.131 --> 58:06.004
Dump this phone
and get a new number
and call me.

58:06.178 --> 58:08.136
I'’ll text you, got it?

58:08.310 --> 58:09.834
Hey, who gets his share?

58:12.097 --> 58:14.142
What'’s going on?

58:14.969 --> 58:16.710
Willis is dead.

58:16.884 --> 58:18.233
What? How?

58:22.150 --> 58:23.935
These guys are getting greedy.

58:26.459 --> 58:29.418
Willis was a stupid junkie,
always has been.

58:29.593 --> 58:31.899
One less dumbass
to deal with.

58:36.991 --> 58:38.166
Where you going?

58:41.082 --> 58:42.431
I gotta go to work.

59:00.580 --> 59:02.756
How long you been
in this line of work, Pete?

59:10.068 --> 59:11.765
You are going to need this.

59:20.252 --> 59:22.646
Hey, Xander.
What'’s going on?

59:23.951 --> 59:25.083
Yeah, okay.

59:38.923 --> 59:40.664
Get my hot sauce?Yeah.

59:42.622 --> 59:43.623
Nice.

59:44.711 --> 59:46.278
How'’s she doing?

59:46.452 --> 59:48.149
She'’s hungry.
That'’s a good sign.

59:48.323 --> 59:49.368
Yeah.

59:50.325 --> 59:51.500
I appreciate you
doing this.

59:51.675 --> 59:53.415
Of course, man.
I got you.

59:55.722 --> 59:56.723
Oh, hey.

59:57.768 --> 59:59.117
Might need that.

1:00:00.814 --> 1:00:02.250
This is how you do it--
like this.

1:00:02.424 --> 1:00:03.948
And then you go like that.Dad, that'’s boring.

1:00:04.122 --> 1:00:05.340
And then you do this.

1:00:05.514 --> 1:00:06.733
Let'’s eat.You do the twist.

1:00:06.907 --> 1:00:08.953
Twist?
I'’m gonna get everything.

1:00:09.127 --> 1:00:10.824
I'’m gonna get a big bite.Oh, my God.

1:00:10.998 --> 1:00:12.957
What?
She'’s not allowed visitors.

1:00:13.131 --> 1:00:15.481
I'’m sorry.
Immediate family only.

1:00:16.351 --> 1:00:18.789
Uh, it'’s okay.
She'’s okay.

1:00:20.051 --> 1:00:21.618
How are you, Emma?

1:00:23.097 --> 1:00:25.099
You know, great.

1:00:28.189 --> 1:00:29.974
You dating my dad again,
or what?

1:00:32.019 --> 1:00:35.283
I'’m sorry.
I need to take Emma
for a scheduled MRI.

1:00:37.068 --> 1:00:38.547
I'’ll see you
in a little bit, okay?

1:00:38.722 --> 1:00:40.419
She'’s not gonna be that long.

1:00:40.593 --> 1:00:41.855
Are you ready, dear?Mm-hmm.

1:00:54.694 --> 1:00:56.391
I bet you'’re here a lot.

1:00:58.045 --> 1:00:59.830
Any news on Emma'’s progress?

1:01:02.441 --> 1:01:04.486
Why are you here?

1:01:04.661 --> 1:01:07.402
Look, I didn'’t know.
I'’m glad you'’re okay.

1:01:08.752 --> 1:01:10.405
Does your boyfriend know
that you'’re here?

1:01:10.579 --> 1:01:12.233
No.

1:01:14.192 --> 1:01:16.411
Nick.Where are my drives?

1:01:18.762 --> 1:01:19.763
Hmm?

1:01:30.599 --> 1:01:31.992
What'’s this?

1:01:32.166 --> 1:01:34.081
It'’s what you want.

1:01:48.705 --> 1:01:50.881
And how do I know
that'’s not a setup?

1:01:51.055 --> 1:01:53.840
You have to believe me.
I didn'’t mean
for any of this to happen.

1:01:54.014 --> 1:01:56.103
How can I trust you?

1:01:56.277 --> 1:01:57.670
What is wrong with you?

1:01:57.844 --> 1:02:00.586
What--
What is wrong with me?

1:02:01.718 --> 1:02:03.807
Your boyfriend
tried to kill me.

1:02:03.981 --> 1:02:05.547
I had nothing to do with it.

1:02:05.722 --> 1:02:07.985
Wow. Wait, wait.

1:02:08.159 --> 1:02:10.161
Goodbye, Nick.Veronica, wait.

1:02:10.335 --> 1:02:11.379
God--

1:02:16.602 --> 1:02:19.561
No, no, that'’s okay.
I have the file.
I can send it right now.

1:02:21.389 --> 1:02:24.088
What do you got?Do you remember the dead guy
we found in the car?

1:02:24.262 --> 1:02:25.611
Mm-hmm.Bobby Willis.

1:02:25.785 --> 1:02:27.265
The medical examiner
just finished with this guy.

1:02:27.439 --> 1:02:31.922
Check it out.
Heart attack,
asphyxiation, overdose.

1:02:32.096 --> 1:02:34.011
They found large amounts
of cocaine
in this guy'’s system.

1:02:34.185 --> 1:02:36.013
Mostly likely, fentanyl.Is that right?

1:02:36.187 --> 1:02:39.494
And he called in sick
the day of the robbery.

1:02:39.668 --> 1:02:42.280
Bobby Willis.
I know that name.

1:02:42.454 --> 1:02:45.109
Two armed robberies.
One of them
was an armored truck.

1:02:45.283 --> 1:02:46.893
Mm-hmm, that'’s right.

1:02:47.067 --> 1:02:48.982
So listen,
toxicology report'’s
gonna take a few days,

1:02:49.156 --> 1:02:51.680
but they found
he had a crushed trachea.

1:03:00.515 --> 1:03:01.952
Now what?

1:03:02.126 --> 1:03:04.911
Now we see if Willis
was involved in the robbery

1:03:05.085 --> 1:03:06.783
and who his associates were.

1:03:06.957 --> 1:03:08.654
I did a last-known-associates
checkup,

1:03:08.828 --> 1:03:10.874
and I came up
with one name only.

1:03:11.048 --> 1:03:12.092
Jerry Foster.

1:03:12.266 --> 1:03:13.877
Jerry Foster.

1:03:14.051 --> 1:03:16.053
Parole officer says
he and Willis
did a stint together.

1:03:16.227 --> 1:03:18.098
Got released
about the same time.

1:03:18.272 --> 1:03:21.406
And the PO officer also says
that Foster has been
seeing a dancer

1:03:21.580 --> 1:03:24.104
that goes by the name
of Monica Smith,
aka Monique.

1:03:24.278 --> 1:03:26.019
Monique.
You got an address?

1:03:26.193 --> 1:03:29.544
Sure do.
Kenwood 1519.

1:03:30.458 --> 1:03:33.244
1519. Let'’s go.

1:03:40.425 --> 1:03:45.604
Well, I mean,
if this is what I think it is,
two guys should live here.

1:04:46.404 --> 1:04:48.014
What the hell is this?

1:05:09.688 --> 1:05:11.820
Jerry, is that you?

1:05:47.030 --> 1:05:48.727
Are you kidding me?

1:05:48.901 --> 1:05:49.989
I don'’t know.

1:06:03.611 --> 1:06:05.265
Shh.
Jerry, is that you?

1:06:07.746 --> 1:06:10.967
It'’s okay, Ms. Foster.
It'’s just me, Sully.

1:06:11.489 --> 1:06:12.533
Shit.

1:06:14.492 --> 1:06:16.015
You son of a--

1:06:20.759 --> 1:06:22.021
Go around, go around.

1:06:41.693 --> 1:06:42.650
Stay where you are.

1:06:58.884 --> 1:07:00.407
You need somewhere
to take him?

1:07:01.495 --> 1:07:03.280
Yeah, I have--

1:07:03.454 --> 1:07:04.890
I have some questions.

1:07:06.805 --> 1:07:08.067
I know a place.

1:07:30.350 --> 1:07:31.395
Police.

1:07:35.007 --> 1:07:36.487
What can I do for you?

1:07:36.661 --> 1:07:38.924
Hi. We'’re wondering
if a Jerry Foster'’s here.

1:07:39.098 --> 1:07:40.360
What'’d he do now?

1:07:42.623 --> 1:07:44.669
He ain'’t been around
for a few days.

1:07:44.843 --> 1:07:46.453
Okay.
Does he live here?

1:07:46.627 --> 1:07:48.368
Comes and goes.

1:07:49.195 --> 1:07:50.588
Okay.

1:07:50.762 --> 1:07:52.503
Can you tell us anything
about any of his friends?

1:07:55.767 --> 1:07:58.117
Can we come in
and take a look around?

1:07:58.291 --> 1:07:59.684
You got a warrant?Hey.

1:07:59.858 --> 1:08:01.816
No, what we do have
is probable cause,

1:08:01.990 --> 1:08:03.470
and you are on probation,

1:08:03.644 --> 1:08:06.038
so maybe you should
work with us a little bit.

1:08:08.214 --> 1:08:10.825
Only guy I know of
is someone named Sullivan.

1:08:10.999 --> 1:08:12.871
Sometimes he crashes
at Jerry'’s mother'’s house

1:08:13.045 --> 1:08:14.873
somewhere
on Durango Terrace.

1:08:17.093 --> 1:08:19.095
We don'’t talk much
when he'’s here.

1:08:19.269 --> 1:08:22.489
Okay. Thank you.
We appreciate it.

1:08:24.317 --> 1:08:25.318
Thank you.

1:08:29.148 --> 1:08:32.543
Okay, call Reed.
Have her check on
that Durango Terrace address.

1:08:32.717 --> 1:08:34.197
Already on it.

1:08:39.550 --> 1:08:40.638
Hey!

1:08:42.205 --> 1:08:44.424
What the hell?

1:08:45.730 --> 1:08:48.167
Hey, hey, hey.

1:08:48.341 --> 1:08:49.560
Where you meeting Jack?

1:08:50.735 --> 1:08:52.563
Hmm?What are you
talking about?

1:08:52.737 --> 1:08:55.566
Where'’s my
goddamn briefcase, hmm?

1:08:57.394 --> 1:08:59.091
Screw you.

1:09:01.093 --> 1:09:02.312
Can I try?

1:09:03.051 --> 1:09:04.096
Please.

1:09:04.966 --> 1:09:07.099
Who'’s this, your boyfriend?

1:09:07.273 --> 1:09:09.362
You'’ll find out.

1:09:14.933 --> 1:09:16.326
God.

1:09:18.937 --> 1:09:20.243
He ask you a question.

1:09:25.509 --> 1:09:28.729
Oh, I am looking at
a dead man right now.

1:09:36.259 --> 1:09:37.564
No. No.

1:09:38.478 --> 1:09:39.914
No.

1:09:40.915 --> 1:09:43.135
No. No. Mm-mmm.

1:09:43.875 --> 1:09:46.660
No.

1:09:51.274 --> 1:09:53.232
No. No. No.

1:09:54.581 --> 1:09:58.585
No.

1:10:02.154 --> 1:10:04.939
Okay, okay, okay.

1:10:06.811 --> 1:10:08.160
Talk!

1:10:13.209 --> 1:10:15.689
I don'’t know where he is.

1:10:17.996 --> 1:10:19.302
Really.

1:10:19.476 --> 1:10:21.217
Really, I don'’t.

1:10:24.872 --> 1:10:26.352
I don'’t know where he is.

1:10:28.136 --> 1:10:29.225
Really.

1:10:41.062 --> 1:10:42.586
What the hell is this?

1:10:44.327 --> 1:10:47.373
Shit just got real.

1:10:54.989 --> 1:10:56.643
What the hell is this?

1:10:58.863 --> 1:11:02.954
I won'’t stop until I know
where I can find Jack.

1:11:05.652 --> 1:11:09.569
And how far we go
is up to you.

1:11:21.886 --> 1:11:23.453
Okay! Okay!

1:11:25.629 --> 1:11:27.500
Free-- Freeport Casino.

1:11:28.458 --> 1:11:29.676
Tomorrow night.

1:11:34.377 --> 1:11:35.421
Attaboy.

1:11:41.906 --> 1:11:42.994
Good work.

1:11:49.130 --> 1:11:50.175
How'’s my gym?

1:11:52.177 --> 1:11:53.483
My gym is fine.

1:11:59.315 --> 1:12:00.490
Where were you?

1:12:01.534 --> 1:12:02.927
You know where I was.

1:12:03.101 --> 1:12:05.233
No, I don'’t.
You weren'’t at the gym.

1:12:11.588 --> 1:12:12.893
I don'’t care.

1:12:13.851 --> 1:12:15.766
I know you have
feelings for him.

1:12:15.940 --> 1:12:18.421
You don'’t care about me
or you don'’t care
that he'’s alive?

1:12:21.902 --> 1:12:23.164
What the hell, Jack?

1:12:23.339 --> 1:12:24.818
Calm down.

1:12:24.992 --> 1:12:26.429
Don'’t tell me to calm down.

1:12:26.603 --> 1:12:28.648
You went behind my back,
tried to take out my friend.

1:12:28.822 --> 1:12:30.650
You wanna take me out too, huh?

1:12:30.824 --> 1:12:33.479
I saw an opportunity.

1:12:33.653 --> 1:12:36.047
So I took it.
So what?

1:12:36.221 --> 1:12:40.094
That'’s the difference
between people like you
and people like me.

1:12:40.747 --> 1:12:42.488
I make things happen.

1:12:42.662 --> 1:12:44.664
I'’m a winner.

1:12:44.838 --> 1:12:46.884
Ran out of coke, huh?

1:12:47.058 --> 1:12:49.974
I got you
a little refill there.

1:12:50.148 --> 1:12:52.411
You going through
withdrawals here?
Is that what'’s going on here?

1:12:53.760 --> 1:12:54.761
Hmm?

1:13:01.115 --> 1:13:02.595
You need a little snort?

1:13:09.297 --> 1:13:13.084
How about you stay here?
I'’ll go do this deal,
and you just stay grateful.

1:13:13.258 --> 1:13:15.652
No! We had a deal.

1:13:15.826 --> 1:13:17.915
I do this,
and I'’m paid off.

1:13:19.003 --> 1:13:22.093
You want him?
You wanna be a lowlife?

1:13:24.095 --> 1:13:25.705
There'’s the door.

1:13:25.879 --> 1:13:28.012
You better
get your shit straight.

1:14:04.962 --> 1:14:05.963
Police.

1:14:24.416 --> 1:14:25.461
Gun!

1:14:36.863 --> 1:14:38.561
Come on, Jerry.
We got the place surrounded.

1:14:38.735 --> 1:14:40.606
Jerry, is that you?

1:14:44.958 --> 1:14:46.003
Jerry?

1:15:00.017 --> 1:15:02.062
Call it in.Copy that.

1:15:44.540 --> 1:15:47.020
You get my text
about the drop?

1:15:47.194 --> 1:15:49.196
Yeah, I'’ll be there.

1:15:49.370 --> 1:15:51.155
Good.
Don'’t screw this up.

1:15:51.329 --> 1:15:53.592
Easy exchange,
and we all get a cut.

1:15:53.766 --> 1:15:54.985
We'’ll see.

1:16:44.469 --> 1:16:47.864
Where you taking that stuff?
That'’s my stuff. Don'’t--

1:16:48.038 --> 1:16:50.431
Bring that back here.
I'’m gonna call the police.

1:16:53.913 --> 1:16:56.176
It'’s okay, sweetheart.
We are the police.

1:16:56.350 --> 1:16:58.222
You'’re okay. Listen.I'’m gonna call the police.

1:16:58.396 --> 1:16:59.876
We-- We are the police, love.

1:17:00.050 --> 1:17:01.617
It'’s okay.

1:17:01.791 --> 1:17:03.488
Look after her.Sir, got '’em.

1:17:03.662 --> 1:17:05.838
Good.
Catalog that.

1:17:06.012 --> 1:17:08.798
Take a look at this.
Found it on the fridge.

1:17:08.972 --> 1:17:12.671
Before you ask,
it'’s a cell phone number.
It belongs to a Jerry Foster.

1:17:12.845 --> 1:17:15.065
Call us
when you get a ping.You got it.

1:17:15.239 --> 1:17:16.675
That'’s for you.

1:17:54.582 --> 1:17:56.106
Pull over here.

1:19:10.746 --> 1:19:12.573
Yep, what do you got?

1:19:14.575 --> 1:19:16.839
Yeah, of course
I know where that is.
We'’re on our way.

1:19:17.013 --> 1:19:18.971
Send for backup.
We may need it.

1:19:19.145 --> 1:19:21.321
Reed got a ping
on that number.
Let'’s go.

1:19:53.527 --> 1:19:54.615
What the hell?

1:19:54.790 --> 1:19:57.053
Somebody must'’ve
paid the bill.

1:20:42.185 --> 1:20:43.229
Dead?

1:20:43.403 --> 1:20:44.709
Still a pulse.

1:20:52.108 --> 1:20:54.023
What the hell
did you do to him, Jack?

1:20:59.115 --> 1:21:00.899
Just taking us out
one by one?

1:21:01.073 --> 1:21:02.988
What are you
talking about, Jerry?

1:21:07.514 --> 1:21:08.907
You and that stupid whore
do this?

1:21:11.214 --> 1:21:14.260
You guys are the ones
that got greedy.
This wasn'’t us.

1:21:18.699 --> 1:21:21.137
What are you talking about?
Then who did?

1:21:36.935 --> 1:21:38.284
Where'’s the money?

1:21:41.461 --> 1:21:44.856
Okay, easy.
It'’s close by.

1:21:46.162 --> 1:21:47.467
Here'’s the deal.

1:21:47.641 --> 1:21:50.383
You give me the case,
and you get your money.

1:21:53.996 --> 1:21:55.823
Set it down.

1:21:57.869 --> 1:22:00.654
Tell you what.
You want more?

1:22:05.572 --> 1:22:07.444
Easy now. Easy.

1:22:10.055 --> 1:22:11.230
Jerry, don'’t be stupid.

1:22:43.610 --> 1:22:44.655
Nick?

1:22:48.746 --> 1:22:50.269
Drop the gun, Jack.

1:22:54.491 --> 1:22:55.971
Oh, we make
a nice threesome.

1:22:59.757 --> 1:23:01.367
Do you love her?

1:23:09.027 --> 1:23:10.550
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:23:10.724 --> 1:23:12.509
No, no. Oh, shit.

1:23:13.379 --> 1:23:14.990
No, no, no,
hang on, hang on.

1:23:15.164 --> 1:23:17.514
You'’re gonna be okay.
I'’m gonna get you out of here.

1:23:17.688 --> 1:23:20.560
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

1:23:20.734 --> 1:23:23.041
Hang on, hang on.
You stay with me.

1:23:24.042 --> 1:23:26.044
Okay? You'’ll be fine.

1:23:29.700 --> 1:23:31.223
What took you so long?

1:23:36.924 --> 1:23:39.753
Shh. It'’s fine, it'’s fine.

1:23:39.927 --> 1:23:42.365
Mr. Valenti
wanted me to give you this,

1:23:43.366 --> 1:23:44.802
for your daughter.

1:23:47.674 --> 1:23:50.851
Shh. Hang on, hang on.Nick, I'’m sorry.

1:24:01.862 --> 1:24:02.907
You need my help?

1:24:03.864 --> 1:24:04.909
No.

1:25:38.176 --> 1:25:40.135
Looks like
we'’re a little late
for this party.

1:25:40.309 --> 1:25:41.571
Yeah, I guess so.

1:25:42.572 --> 1:25:44.051
You remember this guy?

1:25:45.052 --> 1:25:46.924
Jerry Foster.

1:25:47.098 --> 1:25:48.143
That'’s right.

1:25:50.841 --> 1:25:53.148
What are we missing, Owens?
Hmm?

1:25:53.322 --> 1:25:54.540
What are we missing here?

1:25:57.717 --> 1:25:58.718
What are you thinking?

1:26:01.156 --> 1:26:02.983
Trajectory.
It doesn'’t make sense.

1:26:03.158 --> 1:26:04.333
Look at his feet.

1:26:04.811 --> 1:26:05.856
Okay?

1:26:14.865 --> 1:26:15.866
Dust '’em up.

1:26:16.954 --> 1:26:18.608
Anything?No, sir.

1:26:20.218 --> 1:26:22.916
Okay, keep looking.
I'’m gonna be outside.

1:26:27.530 --> 1:26:29.880
I mean, who knows?

1:26:30.054 --> 1:26:33.449
I'’m sure these guys
all probably had
side deals with each other.

1:26:33.623 --> 1:26:36.626
That'’s why they met here, right?
Split the proceeds
from the robbery.

1:26:36.800 --> 1:26:38.018
Where'’s the money?

1:26:38.976 --> 1:26:40.020
Give me that.

1:26:44.068 --> 1:26:47.289
Okay, the getaway van
and all the crew
have been accounted for,

1:26:47.463 --> 1:26:49.900
so, you think--

1:26:50.074 --> 1:26:51.728
What about
the cryptocurrency?

1:26:52.511 --> 1:26:53.947
Unaccounted for.

1:26:54.121 --> 1:26:56.428
All accounted for,
but no Eric Thompson.

1:26:56.602 --> 1:26:59.170
What, you were expecting
to find him here?

1:27:00.389 --> 1:27:01.781
Now do me a favor.

1:27:01.955 --> 1:27:04.567
See if any of these folks
worked or rode

1:27:04.741 --> 1:27:07.091
for any of these
ride-share companies, okay?

1:27:07.265 --> 1:27:08.266
Okay.

1:28:19.076 --> 1:28:20.643
Monsieur Charpentier?

1:28:20.817 --> 1:28:22.297
Pete.

1:28:22.471 --> 1:28:23.820
Right on time.

1:28:27.214 --> 1:28:28.433
What happened?

1:28:38.878 --> 1:28:40.227
Where'’s the seed phrase?

1:28:40.402 --> 1:28:43.013
Seeds?It was in the case.
Now it'’s not.

1:28:43.187 --> 1:28:47.104
Mr. Valenti told us
to drop it off.
That'’s all.

1:28:47.278 --> 1:28:49.715
Other than that,
we know nothing about seeds.

1:28:51.587 --> 1:28:53.371
Payment'’s due
in 30 days.

1:29:03.773 --> 1:29:05.862
They'’re worthless
without the seed phrase.

1:29:06.036 --> 1:29:07.864
It'’s out of our hands, okay?

1:29:10.214 --> 1:29:12.477
What can I say?Pete.

1:29:14.087 --> 1:29:15.959
Merde!
