00:27.500 --> 00:29.460
All right, guys. Quiet down.

00:29.500 --> 00:30.460
Kill it.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.460
All right,
I'd like to propose a toast.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.460
To the three rings of marriage.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.460
There's the engagement ring.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.460
There's the wedding ring.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.460
And there's suffering!

00:51.500 --> 00:52.460
To Paul!

00:54.500 --> 00:55.460
Thank you.

00:56.500 --> 00:57.460
Drink! Drink! Drink!

01:13.500 --> 01:15.460
Come on, man.
Loosen up a little.

01:16.500 --> 01:18.460
I'm the uptight lawyer...

01:18.500 --> 01:20.460
but you were always
the crazy one in the family.

01:20.500 --> 01:22.460
- I know.
- Relax and have fun.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.460
My bachelor party...

01:25.500 --> 01:27.460
was the last good time
in my marriage.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.460
Maybe your marriage
didn't work...

01:30.500 --> 01:32.460
because you had too much fun
at the bachelor party.

01:32.500 --> 01:35.460
It didn't work because Deena
was impossible to please.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.460
Your marriage will be fine.
You've got Karen.

01:37.500 --> 01:39.460
And she's beautiful.
Smart. Funny.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.460
She's kind to animals.

01:45.500 --> 01:47.460
She's very, very sexy.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.460
She's got
a great sense of style.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.460
- Pete.
- Yeah?

01:51.500 --> 01:52.460
I'm just a big fan.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.460
I can't believe my little
brother's getting married.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.460
I got to run. I love you.

02:00.500 --> 02:01.460
OK. Hey!

02:03.500 --> 02:05.460
You are a lucky, lucky man.

02:16.500 --> 02:17.460
Paul, up high!

02:20.500 --> 02:22.460
Good luck in there.
Congratulations.

02:22.500 --> 02:23.460
Thanks.

02:29.500 --> 02:31.460
Listen, Jim, about the girls...

02:32.500 --> 02:33.460
I'm not sure.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.460
- I totally understand, dude.
- You do?

02:41.500 --> 02:42.460
- Absolutely.
- Good.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.460
And I want you
to know something, man.

02:45.500 --> 02:46.460
I don't give a shit.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.460
- You be the groom.
- That's not how it works.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.460
Hang on a second.
I'm giving you a chance...

02:52.500 --> 02:54.460
to be the groom
at a bachelor party...

02:54.500 --> 02:57.460
and you don't have
to get married next Saturday.

02:57.500 --> 02:58.460
Think about that.

03:03.500 --> 03:04.460
Listen up, everybody.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.460
As of this moment,
I am the groom.

03:15.500 --> 03:16.460
We got tiki girls!

03:46.500 --> 03:47.460
Where's the groom?

03:59.500 --> 04:00.460
Sorry.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.460
You really suck at this.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.460
Yeah. It's my first day.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.459
Would you buy me a beer?

04:16.500 --> 04:17.459
Yeah.

04:19.500 --> 04:20.459
Jimmy.

06:09.500 --> 06:10.460
- Hello?
- Hi, Paul.

06:12.500 --> 06:13.460
Hi, Mrs. Cooper.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.460
I'm going to be
your mother-in-law.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.460
Call me Sandra.

06:17.500 --> 06:20.460
- Hi, Sandra.
- How was the bachelor party?

06:20.500 --> 06:21.460
You know, silly.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.460
It's really
such an outdated ritual.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.460
You are
every mother-in-law's dream.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.460
Can you put Karen on for me?

06:29.500 --> 06:30.460
Sure. Hold on.

06:35.500 --> 06:36.460
Oh, my God.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.460
What is it?
Is something the matter?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.460
I guess Karen
hasn't arrived yet.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.460
What do you mean?

06:44.500 --> 06:47.460
She's on her way over.
She should be there by now.

06:47.500 --> 06:48.460
Nope. Not here yet.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.460
Sandra, I have to get going.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.460
Could you please have her...

06:54.500 --> 06:55.460
Holy shit.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.460
Miss? Ma'am?

07:03.500 --> 07:05.460
- Hey.
- You have to leave now.

07:06.500 --> 07:08.460
Good morning to you, too.

07:09.500 --> 07:12.460
I'm not a rude guy,
but you have to go now!

07:12.500 --> 07:13.460
OK, I'm going.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.460
My fiancee
is on her way over here.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.460
You're getting married?

07:20.500 --> 07:22.460
Only if you leave
really, really soon.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.460
You weren't the guy
with the groom hat on.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.460
I'd love to explain,
but you have to leave.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.460
I'm going
to get my ass kicked.

07:30.500 --> 07:31.460
That is very clear.

07:40.500 --> 07:41.460
What happened?

07:41.500 --> 07:42.460
OK, let's go.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.460
Bad news.
I can't find my underwear.

07:45.500 --> 07:46.460
Can I mail them to you?

07:46.500 --> 07:48.460
Yes, please.
They're my only pair.

07:48.500 --> 07:49.460
Give me your address.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.460
I have more than
one pair of underwear.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.460
I'll find them
before she gets here.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.460
Calm down.
If you're freaking out...

07:59.500 --> 08:02.460
when your fiancee gets here,
you'll freak her out.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.460
You're freaking me out,
and I don't even know you.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.460
Just be cool.

08:05.500 --> 08:06.460
I'm a very cool guy.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.460
Cooler than most of the guys
you probably meet.

08:10.500 --> 08:13.460
No offense. This is just
a bad situation for me.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.460
Trust me. I'm not this guy.

08:15.500 --> 08:16.460
After you.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.460
If you see a pair of
bikini underwear lying around...

08:30.500 --> 08:31.460
see this guy.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.460
Could you not say that, please?

08:35.500 --> 08:37.460
Can you do me a favor
and take the back stairs?

08:37.500 --> 08:40.460
In case I had any speck
of self-esteem left?

08:40.500 --> 08:43.460
I bet that goes over well
with the ladies.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.460
There are no ladies,
all right?

08:45.500 --> 08:47.460
- Right.
- It's actually...

08:48.500 --> 08:50.460
Thank you, Mrs. Jackson.

08:50.500 --> 08:51.460
Aloha.

08:52.500 --> 08:53.460
Wedding planner.

08:59.500 --> 09:02.460
We were thinking of going
with the whole luau thing.

09:03.500 --> 09:04.460
Good day.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.460
Shit!

09:14.500 --> 09:15.460
Not there. God!

09:37.500 --> 09:38.460
Shit.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.460
Could you undo the chain?

09:44.500 --> 09:45.460
One second!

09:49.500 --> 09:51.460
Paul! What's going on?

09:56.500 --> 09:59.460
Please undo the chain.
I am standing out here.

10:03.500 --> 10:04.460
Paul, are you OK?

10:07.500 --> 10:09.460
Karen, sweetheart,
what a surprise.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.460
Why'd you chain the door shut?

10:11.500 --> 10:13.460
You can't be too safe.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.460
How was the bachelor party?
Hung over?

10:17.500 --> 10:18.460
Not at all.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.460
I know what happens
at these things...

10:21.500 --> 10:23.460
and you should not
feel guilty...

10:23.500 --> 10:25.460
and you don't
have to tell me anything.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.460
Unless there's something
you want to tell me.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.460
Don't leave!
Let me explain!

10:33.500 --> 10:34.460
Shut up!

10:38.500 --> 10:40.460
Maybe I had a drink or two.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.460
Yeah. I'm sure
you kept it to two.

10:45.500 --> 10:46.460
OK, look.

10:47.500 --> 10:50.460
I got all your outfits
for the parties this week.

10:51.500 --> 10:52.460
This...

10:52.500 --> 10:54.460
Wow. That's a nice sweater.

10:54.500 --> 10:55.460
And you like?

10:56.500 --> 10:57.460
I like.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.460
I thought it would be perfect
for the rehearsal dinner.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.460
- Perfect.
- I knew you'd like it.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.460
How is the string quartet
coming along?

11:06.500 --> 11:07.460
I'm on it.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.460
It is the one thing...

11:10.500 --> 11:12.460
I have asked you to do
for this wedding.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.460
Yeah. It's basically
almost completely...

11:20.500 --> 11:21.460
taken care of.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.460
How was the bachelorette party?

11:25.500 --> 11:26.460
Oh, my God. A total blast.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.460
We went to Giggles,
and sat in front...

11:28.500 --> 11:30.460
and heckled the comedians.

11:30.500 --> 11:31.460
Jody got so wasted!

11:33.500 --> 11:34.460
Hello? Earth to Paul.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.460
Over here,
you big party animal.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.460
How about a kiss
for that hangover?

11:40.500 --> 11:41.460
All right.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.460
What are you...

11:52.500 --> 11:55.460
What are you... OK.
I have a million things to do.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.460
My Great Aunt Budge
is coming in tomorrow.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.460
My mom is
completely freaked out.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.460
Your mom called... this morning.

12:04.500 --> 12:05.460
She did?

12:06.500 --> 12:08.460
Did she tell you
I was coming over?

12:09.500 --> 12:11.460
Then why were you
so surprised to see me?

12:12.500 --> 12:14.460
I might be more hung over
than I thought.

12:18.500 --> 12:19.460
You're a weirdo.

12:20.500 --> 12:23.460
Oh, my God.
I have a million things to do.

12:33.500 --> 12:34.460
Oh, God.

12:37.500 --> 12:40.460
What the hell happened last
night? Where were you?

12:40.500 --> 12:42.460
Sorry, chief.
I got waylaid.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.460
If you know what I'm saying...
way laid.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.460
- What?
- That tiki girl Tonya.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.460
I kept trying
to turn off the charm...

12:54.500 --> 12:56.460
but I guess
I couldn't find the switch.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.460
You're not listening to me.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.460
I woke up this morning
with a strange woman in my bed.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.460
How could this happen?
Was I that drunk?

13:02.500 --> 13:05.460
That's awesome!
What are you complaining about?

13:07.500 --> 13:08.460
- What?
- Nice shoes.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.460
Karen got them.
She wants me to break them in.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.460
They're special.

13:14.500 --> 13:15.460
Move.

13:17.500 --> 13:18.460
I got to tell Karen.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.460
Paul, listen to me.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.460
Do not under
any circumstances tell Karen.

13:26.500 --> 13:29.460
What happened last night
is perfectly natural.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.460
We're men. We're hunters.

13:32.500 --> 13:34.460
It's encrypted in our DNA code.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.460
You got to accept that.
Get over it.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.460
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.460
Hi, Jim.
It's Tonya from last night.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.460
I was going to be
in the neighborhood later...

13:46.500 --> 13:49.460
and thought I might stop by,
so give me a call.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.460
Shit.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.460
That poor girl's been Jim-ified.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.460
This is all your fault, man.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.460
Probably...

14:00.500 --> 14:02.460
but Karen's
never going to find out.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.460
And that tiki girl?

14:06.500 --> 14:07.460
Come on.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.460
You'll never see her again.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.460
A survey was made one time
that covered a lot of men...

14:16.500 --> 14:18.460
working men... and these men
were asked this question...

14:18.500 --> 14:19.460
Why do you work?

14:20.500 --> 14:21.460
Why do you get up
in the morning?

14:21.500 --> 14:24.460
Why? Everyone goes to work
in the morning.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.460
And that's the reason
they do it...

14:26.500 --> 14:28.460
because everyone else
is doing it.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.460
And there you have
the trouble today.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.460
It's conformity...

14:32.500 --> 14:34.460
people acting like everyone else
without knowing why...

14:34.500 --> 14:36.460
or where they're going.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.460
We'll have more with Dr. Earl...

14:38.500 --> 14:40.460
after this short break
on KCNP...

14:40.500 --> 14:42.460
the best talk in Seattle.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.460
- Hi!
- Holy shit!

14:51.500 --> 14:53.460
- You work here?
- First day.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.460
What happened to the dancing?

14:54.500 --> 14:55.460
I sucked.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.460
Hey! Let's go, asshole!

14:59.500 --> 15:00.460
Just a sec. Sorry.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.460
Listen, what's your name?

15:04.500 --> 15:05.460
Bec... Hey!

15:07.500 --> 15:09.460
Don't make me
get out of my box, fella!

15:10.500 --> 15:11.460
Fifty cents.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.460
I want you to know,
about what happened...

15:13.500 --> 15:16.460
Have a good day.
Remember to drive safely.

15:19.500 --> 15:20.460
Sorry!

15:20.500 --> 15:22.460
- It's hitting the...
- I know!

15:23.500 --> 15:26.460
Look what you...
You dented the hood of my car!

15:27.500 --> 15:29.460
- Hang on!
- Good to see you.

15:32.500 --> 15:33.460
Stop!

15:33.500 --> 15:34.460
That's her.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.460
I'm a little disturbed
about something, Paul.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.460
What's that, sir?

16:01.500 --> 16:03.460
You had a bachelor party?

16:03.500 --> 16:05.460
I... lt's totally...
It's... I...

16:06.500 --> 16:08.460
I may be
your bride-to-be's father...

16:08.500 --> 16:10.460
but I'm still a man. Huh?

16:13.500 --> 16:15.460
You sick son of a bitch!

16:15.500 --> 16:17.460
- I'll kill you!
- You're choking me!

16:21.500 --> 16:23.460
No, it was pretty uneventful.

16:23.500 --> 16:25.460
We watched
hours of action movies...

16:25.500 --> 16:27.460
and talked about high school.

16:28.500 --> 16:29.460
It was a hoot.

16:30.500 --> 16:32.460
Good answer. That's my boy.

16:34.500 --> 16:35.460
You like that, huh?

16:37.500 --> 16:39.460
I know what you're thinking.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.460
It's the good life...
like you see on TV.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.460
"That could never happen to me."

16:46.500 --> 16:47.460
You've made it, son.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.460
You're one of us. Enjoy.

16:49.500 --> 16:50.460
Welcome to the club.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.460
Thank you.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.460
Boys, let's get started.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.460
I've been in this business
a long time...

17:01.500 --> 17:04.460
and if we get "Modern Rifleman"
up to 750,000...

17:05.500 --> 17:08.460
I'll strip down to my shorts
and jump in the ocean.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.460
My question is...

17:12.500 --> 17:13.460
once you've stripped down
to your shorts...

17:13.500 --> 17:15.460
will you actually
loosen your tie?

17:19.500 --> 17:21.460
Have I fired you today, Curt?

17:30.500 --> 17:33.460
Enough frivolity.
Let's get down to business.

17:37.500 --> 17:38.460
- Paul?
- Yeah?

17:39.500 --> 17:41.460
Tell us how
the ad campaign looks...

17:41.500 --> 17:42.460
for "North American
River and Stream."

17:42.500 --> 17:44.460
Pretty good, sir.
I'm projecting...

17:46.500 --> 17:48.460
Why don't you get up there
and talk to us?

17:48.500 --> 17:50.460
Make a presentation.
Take over the room.

17:51.500 --> 17:54.460
Hooking us is half the battle.
Still got to reel us in.

18:11.500 --> 18:12.460
OK...

18:15.500 --> 18:17.460
It's a good news,
bad news situation.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.460
The good news is...

18:24.500 --> 18:27.460
we've had steady growth
over the last six months.

18:28.500 --> 18:29.460
- Nice.
- Good.

18:35.500 --> 18:37.460
Just give me a second here.

18:48.500 --> 18:51.460
Do you mind if I take
a quick restroom break?

18:52.500 --> 18:53.460
No. Go ahead.

18:54.500 --> 18:55.460
Great. Be right back.

18:59.500 --> 19:02.460
Looks like you're getting
a weak bladder in the family.

19:11.500 --> 19:12.460
Oh, my God, it burns!

19:15.500 --> 19:16.460
What is it?

19:20.500 --> 19:21.460
What...?

19:23.500 --> 19:24.460
Jesus Christ!

19:28.500 --> 19:29.460
Ted. Hey.

19:32.500 --> 19:33.460
God damn it.

19:47.500 --> 19:48.460
Thank you.

19:49.500 --> 19:50.460
Hello.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.460
What can I do for you?

19:54.500 --> 19:56.460
I need to get
some crab medicine.

19:58.500 --> 19:59.460
What?

20:00.500 --> 20:01.460
Crab medicine.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.460
- I don't...
- You know...

20:05.500 --> 20:06.460
Crab medicine.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.460
Let me see.
Crab medicine.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.460
- Gladys!
- What?

20:18.500 --> 20:20.460
Is crab medicine
Aisle 3 or Aisle 4?

20:20.500 --> 20:21.460
Crab medicine?

20:22.500 --> 20:23.460
Crab medicine!

20:23.500 --> 20:24.460
Crab medicine!

20:25.500 --> 20:26.460
- Yeah!
- Aisle 3!

20:27.500 --> 20:29.460
I'll get it. Thanks.
Excuse me.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.460
Here you go. Good luck.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.460
Are there special directions
for this stuff?

20:43.500 --> 20:45.460
I don't know.
Let me ask Phil.

20:48.500 --> 20:50.460
Phil, this crab stuff...

20:50.500 --> 20:53.460
Is there any special
application technique, sir?

20:53.500 --> 20:54.460
He wants to see it.

20:55.500 --> 20:56.460
Paul!

20:57.500 --> 21:00.460
My future son-in-law.
I thought that was you.

21:00.500 --> 21:01.460
What a nice surprise.

21:01.500 --> 21:02.460
Sandra, hi.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.460
Small world.
What brings you here?

21:06.500 --> 21:08.460
Actually,
I forgot something in...

21:08.500 --> 21:11.460
I am so relieved
that your mother decided...

21:11.500 --> 21:13.460
not to cook
the rehearsal dinner.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.460
I'm not saying
anything about her cooking.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.460
It's a really big job.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.460
That reminds me. I've got
to help her find a caterer.

21:19.500 --> 21:20.460
There's my guy.

21:21.500 --> 21:23.460
You almost left
without your stuff.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.460
Now, about those crabs...

21:25.500 --> 21:26.460
They were delicious.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.460
Jeff is an incredible chef.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.460
He gave me a recipe for...

21:34.500 --> 21:36.460
Crab Louie that was
out of this world.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.460
- Really?
- Yeah. What?

21:38.500 --> 21:39.460
You're a chef?

21:40.500 --> 21:41.460
Yes, I am.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.460
I'm putting myself
through cooking school...

21:44.500 --> 21:46.460
working the pharmacy thing.

21:48.500 --> 21:49.460
Isn't that wonderful?

21:49.500 --> 21:51.460
Is there a chance
you might be able...

21:51.500 --> 21:53.460
to cook dinner
for 20 people on Friday?

21:55.500 --> 21:58.460
It's a rehearsal dinner
for Paul and my daughter.

21:59.500 --> 22:00.460
Wow, I'm honored...

22:01.500 --> 22:03.460
- I can only pay $500.
- Done.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.460
- Wonderful.
- Incredible.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.460
That was easy. Thank you.

22:22.500 --> 22:23.460
Bucky, come on.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.460
These are going
to be our in-laws...

22:31.500 --> 22:33.460
so we really have
to make sure that...

22:33.500 --> 22:35.460
Honey, I'm a pants salesman.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.460
I know how
to act around people.

22:38.500 --> 22:39.460
I can sell pants.

22:40.500 --> 22:41.460
Give your gift, baby.

22:42.500 --> 22:43.460
I like me inside.

22:44.500 --> 22:45.460
- Yes.
- Yeah.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.460
Buck, Dorothy, welcome.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.460
- I'm so sorry we're late.
- You're fine.

22:53.500 --> 22:55.460
- Hi, Buck.
- How are you?

22:56.500 --> 22:57.460
Nice area
you got up here, Kenny.

22:57.500 --> 22:58.460
Yeah, we like it.

22:59.500 --> 23:01.460
Yeah. New Benz, I see.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.460
Must have gotten
ripped off on that thing.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.460
I don't think so.
I looked around.

23:05.500 --> 23:07.460
Just joshing, Ken.
Fine vehicle.

23:08.500 --> 23:10.460
Hi, Dorothy. Hi, Buck.

23:10.500 --> 23:11.460
There she is.

23:12.500 --> 23:14.460
- Hi.
- What a beauty.

23:15.500 --> 23:17.460
What is that waist...
20 inches?

23:17.500 --> 23:18.460
Excuse me?

23:19.500 --> 23:21.460
Where's the groom-to-be?

23:22.500 --> 23:23.460
He's not here yet.

23:23.500 --> 23:26.460
You know Paul.
He always comes a little late.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.460
What do you think of that?

23:30.500 --> 23:32.460
Why don't I get us all a drink?

23:36.500 --> 23:38.460
We've already had a six-pack.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.460
We split that on the way up.

23:42.500 --> 23:43.460
Hors d'oeuvres, sir?

23:44.500 --> 23:46.460
Look at the size
of these shrimps.

23:46.500 --> 23:47.460
Prawns.

23:48.500 --> 23:50.460
- There you go, sugar.
- Oh, sweetheart.

23:50.500 --> 23:51.460
Ma'am?

23:51.500 --> 23:53.460
- Hello.
- Paul's finally here.

23:54.500 --> 23:55.460
Sorry I'm late.

23:56.500 --> 23:57.460
I was telling
your mother about...

23:57.500 --> 24:00.460
the chef I hired to cater
the rehearsal dinner.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.460
A pharmacist
studying to be a chef...

24:03.500 --> 24:05.460
that is really interesting.

24:05.500 --> 24:07.460
There's a very special lady
in the kitchen...

24:07.500 --> 24:09.460
who can't wait
to lay her eyes on you.

24:10.500 --> 24:12.460
Let's go find Aunt Budge.

24:12.500 --> 24:14.460
I can't wait for you
to meet her.

24:14.500 --> 24:15.460
They are so cute.

24:16.500 --> 24:17.460
Yeah, they're cute.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.460
Buck, are you a duffer?

24:21.500 --> 24:24.460
If you mean, do I like
playing with my balls...

24:25.500 --> 24:26.460
the answer's yes.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.460
You know what I mean,
don't you?

24:31.500 --> 24:32.460
Oh, shit.

24:34.500 --> 24:37.460
There's Budge,
talking to my cousin Becky.

24:40.500 --> 24:41.460
Oh, my God.

24:41.500 --> 24:43.460
Aunt Budge, this is Paul.

24:48.500 --> 24:49.460
- He's bald.
- Paul?

24:54.500 --> 24:55.460
Oh, God!

24:55.500 --> 24:58.460
I'm so sorry, Becky.
It is so good to see you.

24:58.500 --> 24:59.460
You look beautiful.

25:02.500 --> 25:03.460
How's life after Ray?

25:04.500 --> 25:06.460
Great.
Best decision I ever made.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.460
You know,
you are probably right.

25:11.500 --> 25:13.460
But it is nice to have someone
to come home to.

25:13.500 --> 25:14.460
Oh, God. Sorry.

25:16.500 --> 25:17.460
No. It's especially
nice to come home...

25:17.500 --> 25:19.460
to that someone
in bed with two girls.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.460
Two girls with one man...
Oh, trust me!

25:22.500 --> 25:24.460
You never walk away satisfied.

25:24.500 --> 25:27.460
Reminds me of the time
me and Kathleen O'Rourke...

25:29.500 --> 25:30.460
who was a bit of a tart...

25:30.500 --> 25:32.460
I'll see where Paul is.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.460
We were down
at the pub celebrating...

25:36.500 --> 25:38.460
- Give me some, will you?
- Oh, no.

25:38.500 --> 25:40.460
- Just a little bit.
- It's my wine.

25:45.500 --> 25:46.460
Paul? Where'd you go?

26:11.500 --> 26:12.460
What are you doing?

26:14.500 --> 26:15.460
Karen? Hey...

26:16.500 --> 26:17.460
You're asleep?

26:18.500 --> 26:20.460
I guess so.
I lost you somehow.

26:20.500 --> 26:21.460
I got disoriented.

26:22.500 --> 26:24.460
This is really weird.
Why did you just...

26:26.500 --> 26:27.460
OK. The truth is...

26:28.500 --> 26:30.460
I was gonna pop out
and surprise you.

26:31.500 --> 26:33.460
The old
"under the coats" routine.

26:33.500 --> 26:35.460
But while I was laying here...

26:36.500 --> 26:38.460
it was so warm, I dozed off.

26:45.500 --> 26:47.460
Never mind.
Let's go meet Aunt Budge.

26:55.500 --> 26:57.460
Becky, I found him.
He's up here.

27:02.500 --> 27:04.460
I'll just get my purse.

27:05.500 --> 27:06.460
He exists. I swear.

27:15.500 --> 27:16.460
I know you're in there.

27:16.500 --> 27:17.460
Yeah?

27:18.500 --> 27:19.460
What is wrong?

27:19.500 --> 27:20.460
It's diarrhea.

27:23.500 --> 27:24.460
Oh, no.

27:25.500 --> 27:27.460
Maybe I should just wait here.

27:28.500 --> 27:31.460
Stick it out...
Or maybe I should just leave.

27:33.500 --> 27:36.460
No! You can't leave.
You haven't met Aunt Budge.

27:36.500 --> 27:39.460
Why don't you wait
and see how you feel in a bit?

27:41.500 --> 27:42.460
OK.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.460
Everyone, find your names
and sit down.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.460
I guess we'll sit here.

28:32.500 --> 28:34.460
A lot of fabric's overrated.

28:48.500 --> 28:51.460
I'll drink to that, Bucky.
Where's the drinks?

28:51.500 --> 28:52.460
Sweetie, grab it.

28:53.500 --> 28:55.460
Oh, no. Hey, everyone!

28:55.500 --> 28:57.460
I'd like to make a toast.

29:02.500 --> 29:04.460
Here's to Karen,
the bride-to-be.

29:04.500 --> 29:06.460
Oh, gosh. Thanks, Becky.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.460
That's my car!

29:24.500 --> 29:25.460
Come on, Buck.

29:35.500 --> 29:36.460
Everybody stay back.

29:41.500 --> 29:44.460
Nobody touch anything.
Don't disturb the crime scene.

29:44.500 --> 29:46.460
This isn't a crime scene.

29:47.500 --> 29:48.460
There's your culprit, Daddy.

29:48.500 --> 29:51.460
It might be a raccoon.
I'll get my salt gun.

29:53.500 --> 29:56.460
I'll check on Paul.
I hope he's feeling better.

29:58.500 --> 29:59.460
Pretty exciting, huh?

30:06.500 --> 30:07.460
Paul?

30:08.500 --> 30:09.460
Yeah.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.460
Paul, honey, it's Mom!

30:13.500 --> 30:16.460
Did you eat something spicy?
You know how you get.

30:17.500 --> 30:19.460
I got you in my sights.

30:20.500 --> 30:23.460
How'd you like a little
rock salt up your ass?

30:23.500 --> 30:24.460
Holy shit!

30:26.500 --> 30:27.460
Are you all right?

30:28.500 --> 30:29.460
I'm fine!

30:31.500 --> 30:33.460
Honey, just let it come out.

30:33.500 --> 30:34.460
Don't push so hard.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.460
It's almost there.

30:38.500 --> 30:40.460
- Oh, my God.
- It's bad.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.460
What's going on up here?

30:42.500 --> 30:45.460
- Paul's not feeling well.
- Stuck on the crapper?

30:47.500 --> 30:49.460
Yeah! Do you think
I can get some...

30:52.500 --> 30:53.460
...privacy, please?

30:57.500 --> 30:58.460
Better.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.460
How about some
peach cobbler, everybody?

31:04.500 --> 31:06.460
I'd kill for some diarrhea.

31:07.500 --> 31:10.460
I haven't had
a bowel movement in 14 days.

31:15.500 --> 31:17.460
We'll see you guys in a bit.

31:17.500 --> 31:20.460
- Better hide the silver.
- I'll walk you to your car.

31:20.500 --> 31:23.460
I'm so disappointed
that you didn't see Paul.

31:23.500 --> 31:24.460
I'll meet Paul later this week.

31:24.500 --> 31:26.460
Definitely.
I'm so sorry about all this.

31:27.500 --> 31:29.460
- Good night.
- Good night, Becky.

31:33.500 --> 31:34.460
How are you feeling?

31:35.500 --> 31:37.460
OK, I guess.
Is everyone gone?

31:38.500 --> 31:40.460
You missed the whole party.

31:40.500 --> 31:42.460
Too bad.
I'm starting to feel better.

31:51.500 --> 31:54.460
It's better you get sick now
than on Saturday.

31:55.500 --> 31:56.460
That's exactly right.

31:56.500 --> 31:58.460
I just hope
it's out of my system now.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.460
Typical. Forgot my purse.

32:00.500 --> 32:01.460
Becky! Here he is!

32:02.500 --> 32:04.460
This is Paul,
my husband-to-be.

32:09.500 --> 32:11.460
Hi, Becky. Nice to meet you.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.460
So nice to meet you, Paul.

32:16.500 --> 32:18.460
I've heard so much about you.

32:18.500 --> 32:19.460
All lies, I'm sure.

32:22.500 --> 32:23.460
Probably.

32:30.500 --> 32:31.460
You look so familiar.

32:35.500 --> 32:37.460
I get that all the time.

32:40.500 --> 32:41.460
Right?

32:41.500 --> 32:42.460
- You do?
- Yeah.

32:45.500 --> 32:47.460
I'll see you this weekend.

32:50.500 --> 32:51.460
Can't wait. OK.

32:56.500 --> 32:57.460
Nice to meet you.

33:01.500 --> 33:03.460
So that's Cousin Becky?

33:04.500 --> 33:06.460
Yeah.
She's gotten so weird.

33:06.500 --> 33:09.460
No, that's mean.
She's so all over the place.

33:10.500 --> 33:11.460
One week
she's working here...

33:11.500 --> 33:13.460
the next week,
she's working there.

33:13.500 --> 33:16.460
Now she's working at some
record store on Broad Street.

33:18.500 --> 33:19.460
I do feel sorry for her, though.

33:19.500 --> 33:20.460
How come?

33:21.500 --> 33:24.460
Her ex-boyfriend, Ray Donovan.
What a psycho.

33:25.500 --> 33:28.460
It's amazing how fragile
the human body is.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.460
- Don't you think?
- Yes, sir.

33:31.500 --> 33:32.460
Shut the fuck up!

33:33.500 --> 33:35.460
Come on, Ray.
Guy just stole a doughnut.

33:36.500 --> 33:38.460
That's where it starts, Ernie!

33:42.500 --> 33:43.460
How you doing?

33:50.500 --> 33:51.460
Well, hello, fellas.

33:52.500 --> 33:53.460
Ray.

33:54.500 --> 33:55.460
Special delivery.

34:05.500 --> 34:07.460
That's a little disheartening.

34:09.500 --> 34:10.460
No, no, no!

34:12.500 --> 34:14.460
You did not sleep
with her cousin.

34:14.500 --> 34:16.460
I didn't know
she was her cousin.

34:16.500 --> 34:18.460
Why would you sleep with anyone?

34:19.500 --> 34:21.460
When you have Karen,
who's so stunning...

34:23.500 --> 34:25.460
and witty and delectable...

34:26.500 --> 34:28.460
and has
those little dimples...

34:29.500 --> 34:31.460
- Pete.
- What? You are a moron!

34:31.500 --> 34:33.460
How is it? Is it smoking?

34:34.500 --> 34:36.460
If you don't love it...

34:36.500 --> 34:39.460
I have double-breasted white one
sitting on the runway.

34:39.500 --> 34:41.460
Talk about a burning-hot look!

34:41.500 --> 34:43.460
Ahmed, that's fine.
This is great.

34:43.500 --> 34:44.460
- Thanks.
- Word.

34:49.500 --> 34:51.460
Anyway, she was cool about it.

34:53.500 --> 34:54.460
Was she drunk?

34:57.500 --> 34:59.460
- What do you mean?
- Wait till she's drunk.

34:59.500 --> 35:01.460
Next Thanksgiving or Christmas.

35:01.500 --> 35:02.460
This Saturday
at your wedding...

35:02.500 --> 35:04.460
after she's had
four gin and tonics...

35:04.500 --> 35:06.460
and she steps up
to the microphone...

35:06.500 --> 35:07.460
and tells the whole world.

35:07.500 --> 35:08.460
That's not gonna happen.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.460
"Everyone,
your attention please.

35:10.500 --> 35:11.460
"I think you should know...

35:11.500 --> 35:13.460
"that Karen's husband Paul
nailed me last Saturday.

35:13.500 --> 35:16.460
"We had hot sex
and I'm carrying his child.

35:16.500 --> 35:19.460
"Thank you for listening.
Please return to your entrees."

35:19.500 --> 35:21.460
That's not gonna happen.

35:21.500 --> 35:23.460
How are we doing in here,
superstars?

35:23.500 --> 35:25.460
Great, Ahmed! How about it?

35:25.500 --> 35:26.460
I go now.

35:57.500 --> 35:58.460
Right on.

36:12.500 --> 36:13.460
Excuse me, sir?

36:13.500 --> 36:15.460
There's nothing for you
in that stack.

36:18.500 --> 36:19.460
Let me help you with that.

36:19.500 --> 36:21.460
No, I got it. It's OK!

36:21.500 --> 36:22.460
Sorry.

36:25.500 --> 36:27.460
What does that mean...

36:27.500 --> 36:29.460
"There's nothing for you
in that stack"?

36:29.500 --> 36:31.460
That stuff's too advanced.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.460
You're saying I'm not advanced?

36:34.500 --> 36:37.460
No, I'm just saying I know where
you are musically right now...

36:37.500 --> 36:39.460
and it's not in that stack.

36:39.500 --> 36:42.460
Frankly, I'm not really sure
it's in this store.

36:42.500 --> 36:45.460
Really? When did you
become the music expert?

36:46.500 --> 36:48.460
Since Tuesday, Mr. Shiny Shoes.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.460
Wait.
Look, I came by to...

36:54.500 --> 36:55.460
Apologize
for the other night.

36:55.500 --> 36:57.460
And for never mentioning that
you were marrying my cousin!

36:57.500 --> 36:59.460
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

36:59.500 --> 37:00.460
No, don't apologize.

37:00.500 --> 37:01.460
You were amazing.

37:02.500 --> 37:03.460
Well, thank you.

37:04.500 --> 37:07.460
I don't normally sleep
with a girl and then...

37:09.500 --> 37:10.460
Paul, right?

37:11.500 --> 37:13.460
The funny thing is
we didn't sleep together.

37:13.500 --> 37:16.460
We slept together,
but we didn't sleep together.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.460
We didn't?
So I'm not amazing?

37:20.500 --> 37:21.460
I couldn't say.

37:22.500 --> 37:24.460
But for the record,
you were cute.

37:24.500 --> 37:27.460
If things were different
and you hadn't passed out...

37:27.500 --> 37:30.460
with your pants
around your ankles, who knows?

37:30.500 --> 37:33.460
If we didn't sleep together,
how did I get crabs?

37:34.500 --> 37:36.460
- You got crabs?
- You gave me crabs.

37:36.500 --> 37:37.460
I do not have crabs!

37:41.500 --> 37:42.460
You don't have crabs?

37:43.500 --> 37:45.460
God, no.
But if I do get crabs...

37:45.500 --> 37:48.460
I will hunt you down
and kill your crabby ass.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.460
Then how did I get them?

37:50.500 --> 37:52.460
I don't know.
Maybe a toilet seat?

37:53.500 --> 37:55.460
Hey, Paul!
Congratulations, man.

37:56.500 --> 37:57.460
Yeah!

37:59.500 --> 38:00.460
Really, that happens?

38:01.500 --> 38:02.460
We saw it a lot in the lab.

38:02.500 --> 38:04.460
- The lab?
- Long story.

38:07.500 --> 38:08.460
She's hot.

38:15.500 --> 38:17.460
Listen, I'm just hoping...

38:17.500 --> 38:20.460
We'll know each other
for the rest of our lives...

38:20.500 --> 38:21.460
I won't say anything.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.460
You say that now,
but what if...

38:25.500 --> 38:28.460
I'm not going to screw up
what you and Karen have.

38:28.500 --> 38:30.460
You are perfect for each other.

38:31.500 --> 38:32.460
That's right. We are.

38:36.500 --> 38:37.460
Why do you say that?

38:38.500 --> 38:40.460
God, you are exhausting.

38:40.500 --> 38:42.460
Buy this. You'll like it.
Trust me.

38:52.500 --> 38:53.460
Record store?

38:54.500 --> 38:56.460
I thought
she was a tiki dancer.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.460
She's just so cocky,
you know?

38:59.500 --> 39:01.460
I know music.
Come on, I see bands.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.460
Why does she think she knows me?

39:06.500 --> 39:08.460
She doesn't
know anything about me.

39:09.500 --> 39:10.460
I'm cool.

39:10.500 --> 39:13.460
I wear on-the-edge clothing
and hip stuff.

39:14.500 --> 39:15.460
Hang on.

39:15.500 --> 39:16.460
Hi, I'm Jim.

39:23.500 --> 39:24.460
OK.

39:26.500 --> 39:29.460
What's up with that clock?
It still says 10 after 5.

39:30.500 --> 39:32.460
Dude, that clock doesn't work.
Never has.

39:45.500 --> 39:46.460
Asshole!

39:51.500 --> 39:52.460
Yes, that's it.

39:57.500 --> 39:59.460
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Finally.

40:00.500 --> 40:02.460
There was a lot of traffic.

40:02.500 --> 40:05.460
This is our last lesson,
and you are 45 minutes late.

40:05.500 --> 40:08.460
Look at everybody else.
They're better than us.

40:11.500 --> 40:12.460
All right, let's go.

40:25.500 --> 40:26.460
Sorry.

40:33.500 --> 40:35.460
I hope everybody noticed
Karen and Paul.

40:37.500 --> 40:40.460
They are a textbook example
of what not to do.

40:43.500 --> 40:45.460
Karen, would you mind?

40:48.500 --> 40:51.460
This shouldn't be a chore.
Have fun out there.

40:53.500 --> 40:55.460
Let go. Enjoy yourself.

40:55.500 --> 40:56.460
Come on, Howard.

40:56.500 --> 40:59.460
This time, I'm Karen,
and I want to feel your joy...

41:00.500 --> 41:02.460
as you fling me
around that dance floor.

41:03.500 --> 41:04.460
- OK?
- OK.

41:05.500 --> 41:07.460
Good. I am your lady...

41:08.500 --> 41:09.460
and you be my man.

41:11.500 --> 41:12.460
Karen, music please.

41:15.500 --> 41:16.460
Prepare.

41:17.500 --> 41:18.460
One, two, three...

41:21.500 --> 41:22.460
Good, good.

41:23.500 --> 41:24.460
Very good. That's it.

41:27.500 --> 41:30.460
Watch the pretty lady
as she dances around.

41:32.500 --> 41:33.460
And yes, and yes.

41:34.500 --> 41:35.460
That's it.

41:36.500 --> 41:38.460
We're flying, Paul.
Can you feel it?

41:39.500 --> 41:40.460
Everybody!

41:40.500 --> 41:41.460
That's it. Good.

41:53.500 --> 41:54.460
That Howard...

41:55.500 --> 41:57.460
he is so damn graceful,
isn't he?

41:59.500 --> 42:01.460
He's a dance instructor.
It's his job.

42:03.500 --> 42:05.460
I just mean,
a guy with his frame...

42:06.500 --> 42:08.460
you don't see it coming,
and then...

42:09.500 --> 42:12.460
something magical happens
out on that dance floor.

42:17.500 --> 42:18.460
Paul, seat belt.

42:21.500 --> 42:23.460
People surprise you,
is all I'm saying.

42:25.500 --> 42:27.460
Did you book the string quartet?

42:27.500 --> 42:29.460
I was thinking,
maybe we should do...

42:30.500 --> 42:32.460
something like a band.

42:33.500 --> 42:34.460
String quartet?

42:34.500 --> 42:36.460
I don't know if
that's really our thing.

42:36.500 --> 42:38.460
A band,
playing music we like.

42:39.500 --> 42:41.460
It's a little bit lighter...

42:45.500 --> 42:48.460
Or we could stick with
the string quartet.

42:53.500 --> 42:54.460
Jump out. Chop, chop.

42:56.500 --> 42:57.460
I'll go find a spot.

42:58.500 --> 42:59.460
Great.

43:03.500 --> 43:04.460
Hey, lollipop!

43:08.500 --> 43:09.460
Whoa, easy. Breathe.

43:11.500 --> 43:12.460
Just a little wind
knocked out of you.

43:12.500 --> 43:14.460
There you go.
Bad news, sports fan.

43:15.500 --> 43:17.460
You picked the wrong guy's girl
to fornicate with!

43:17.500 --> 43:18.460
What?

43:19.500 --> 43:21.460
I'm a cop,
and Becky belongs to me.

43:21.500 --> 43:23.460
I think there's a mistake.

43:23.500 --> 43:25.460
Really?
Because I had her followed...

43:27.500 --> 43:29.460
and the tail came back
with these photos...

43:29.500 --> 43:31.460
and those skinny arms,
concave chest...

43:32.500 --> 43:33.460
kind of looks like you,
don't you think?

43:33.500 --> 43:34.460
No.

43:35.500 --> 43:36.460
Shit!

43:40.500 --> 43:42.460
All these sugary snacks!

43:42.500 --> 43:45.460
Would you actually put
this stuff in your body?

43:48.500 --> 43:49.460
OK. All right.

43:50.500 --> 43:53.460
You made the biggest mistake
of your life...

43:55.500 --> 43:57.460
when you messed
with my girl, cupcake.

43:58.500 --> 44:00.460
And mistakes have consequences.

44:02.500 --> 44:04.460
Help! Please, somebody!

44:08.500 --> 44:09.460
Hello.

44:09.500 --> 44:11.460
Today is your lucky day.

44:13.500 --> 44:14.460
Come on. Come on.

44:16.500 --> 44:17.460
I don't even know you!

44:17.500 --> 44:18.460
Get in.

44:21.500 --> 44:22.460
Get in where?

44:22.500 --> 44:23.460
The dumpster.

44:24.500 --> 44:25.460
- Really?
- Yeah.

44:29.500 --> 44:31.460
Just give me a second here.

44:36.500 --> 44:37.460
You sicken me.

44:42.500 --> 44:44.460
I told you,
there's a big mix-up!

44:54.500 --> 44:55.460
What happened?

44:56.500 --> 44:57.460
I was mugged.

44:59.500 --> 45:01.460
Oh, my God.
Paul, you're bleeding.

45:01.500 --> 45:03.460
What is all this stuff?

45:03.500 --> 45:05.460
Chocolate milk and cheese puffs.

45:05.500 --> 45:06.460
Oh, my God, Paul.

45:07.500 --> 45:10.460
I don't know.
I was carrying the groceries...

45:10.500 --> 45:12.460
and this guy tried
to take them from me.

45:13.500 --> 45:14.460
But I fought back.

45:14.500 --> 45:16.460
I fought like a tiger.

45:16.500 --> 45:18.460
I had the strength of ten men.

45:18.500 --> 45:20.460
He ran away like a little girl.

45:24.500 --> 45:25.460
Sweet.

45:26.500 --> 45:28.460
Did you get a good look at him?

45:29.500 --> 45:31.460
Not really.
It all happened so fast.

45:33.500 --> 45:35.460
What color was his hair?

45:35.500 --> 45:36.460
Red.

45:37.500 --> 45:39.460
Dreaded... in a way
that I've never seen.

45:39.500 --> 45:41.460
- Dreadlocks.
- And a gold tooth.

45:43.500 --> 45:44.460
That is so street.

45:45.500 --> 45:47.460
Size?
Was he big, tall, short?

45:47.500 --> 45:48.460
Five-six.

45:49.500 --> 45:50.460
Or six-two.

45:53.500 --> 45:55.460
- Somewhere in there?
- Yeah.

45:55.500 --> 45:57.460
Any identifying marks?

45:59.500 --> 46:00.460
Yeah. A heinous scar.

46:05.500 --> 46:06.460
Over his left eye.

46:07.500 --> 46:09.460
Your left eye, sir,
or his left eye?

46:11.500 --> 46:13.460
You're pointing to your right.

46:13.500 --> 46:16.460
Looking at him,
his left eye or your left?

46:17.500 --> 46:18.460
His left side.

46:18.500 --> 46:20.460
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

46:21.500 --> 46:22.460
Left eye.

46:24.500 --> 46:25.460
He had a tattoo.

46:26.500 --> 46:28.460
A barbed-wire choker tattoo.

46:30.500 --> 46:32.460
Probably gang-related.

46:33.500 --> 46:34.460
Gangbanger.

46:35.500 --> 46:38.460
Was the assailant
Caucasian or non-Caucasian?

46:40.500 --> 46:41.460
Non.

46:41.500 --> 46:43.460
- Was he black?
- Not necessarily.

46:43.500 --> 46:45.460
- What was he?
- Mix. Black, white.

46:47.500 --> 46:49.460
- Black, white.
- Light-skinned black man.

46:49.500 --> 46:51.460
Or a dark-skinned white man.

46:51.500 --> 46:53.460
God, it must have been
so confusing.

46:53.500 --> 46:55.460
Did he say anything to you?

46:58.500 --> 47:01.460
Oh, God, Paul,
did he say something to you?

47:01.500 --> 47:02.460
Yeah.

47:04.500 --> 47:06.460
Don't keep that inside.
What did he say?

47:08.500 --> 47:10.460
- He said...
- It's OK.

47:11.500 --> 47:13.460
"Give me those groceries,
Whitey."

47:16.500 --> 47:18.460
"Give me your groceries,
Whitey."

47:18.500 --> 47:19.460
Well...

47:19.500 --> 47:21.460
But you say he could've
been white himself.

47:21.500 --> 47:23.460
You did say that, sir.

47:23.500 --> 47:24.460
What's going on here?

47:25.500 --> 47:27.460
Am I on trial?
I didn't even do anything!

47:29.500 --> 47:30.460
I told you
it happened all so fast.

47:30.500 --> 47:33.460
You're safe. That's it.
I think we're done here.

47:34.500 --> 47:36.460
That's it for Paul.
Good luck.

47:37.500 --> 47:38.460
We're just trying
to get the facts...

47:38.500 --> 47:39.460
do our job.

47:40.500 --> 47:41.460
Thanks.

47:42.500 --> 47:44.460
Good luck with everything.

47:50.500 --> 47:52.460
You poor thing, sweetheart.

47:53.500 --> 47:56.460
Just sit tight.
I'll get you some aspirin.

47:56.500 --> 47:57.460
Thank you, baby.

47:58.500 --> 47:59.460
I'll be interested to see...

47:59.500 --> 48:01.460
if the police
come up with any leads.

48:02.500 --> 48:04.460
Honey, I don't think they will.

48:04.500 --> 48:07.460
A little mugging...
They have bigger fish to fry.

48:08.500 --> 48:09.460
But they're good men.

48:12.500 --> 48:13.460
What are these?

48:15.500 --> 48:16.460
I don't know.

48:19.500 --> 48:21.460
I'll tell you what they are...
women's underwear.

48:21.500 --> 48:23.460
I found them
in the toilet tank.

48:24.500 --> 48:25.460
The toilet tank?

48:26.500 --> 48:29.460
The water was leaking,
so I went to lift the...

48:31.500 --> 48:33.460
What is going on here?

48:39.500 --> 48:41.460
Did you have a girl
in this apartment?

48:43.500 --> 48:45.460
Karen! Absolutely not!

48:47.500 --> 48:49.460
Those underwear are yours.

48:51.500 --> 48:52.460
No, they are not.

48:53.500 --> 48:56.460
They were gonna be yours.
I got them for you.

48:56.500 --> 48:58.460
For your birthday. Enjoy.

49:00.500 --> 49:02.460
My birthday
was three months ago.

49:02.500 --> 49:03.460
I know.

49:03.500 --> 49:05.460
But then I found
that locket you wanted...

49:05.500 --> 49:07.460
and I gave that to you instead.

49:07.500 --> 49:10.460
I wanted to give these to you
at a later date...

49:10.500 --> 49:13.460
so I went ahead and hid them
in the toilet tank.

49:16.500 --> 49:17.460
Why aren't they in a box?

49:17.500 --> 49:19.460
Why aren't they in a box?

49:20.500 --> 49:22.460
Oddly enough,
that's how they came.

49:23.500 --> 49:25.460
I found them
in an underwear bin.

49:26.500 --> 49:29.460
A bin? Where do they sell
underwear out of a bin?

49:32.500 --> 49:33.460
Spend Mart.

49:35.500 --> 49:37.460
You expect me to believe...

49:37.500 --> 49:39.460
that you purchased
a pair of underwear...

49:41.500 --> 49:43.460
out of a bin at Spend Mart.

49:45.500 --> 49:46.460
Is that your story?

49:48.500 --> 49:49.460
Yeah.

49:54.500 --> 49:56.460
Oh, my God. These are dirty.

49:57.500 --> 49:59.460
What? That's disgusting!

50:00.500 --> 50:03.460
I can't believe those fuckers
sold me dirty underwear!

50:03.500 --> 50:04.460
That is just wrong!

50:04.500 --> 50:06.460
Now I'm really glad
I didn't give them to you.

50:06.500 --> 50:08.460
I'm hungry.
Should we eat something?

50:10.500 --> 50:12.460
Paul, listen to me.
I am not stupid.

50:14.500 --> 50:16.460
Please tell me
what's going on here...

50:16.500 --> 50:19.460
and I want you to be
totally honest with me.

50:20.500 --> 50:22.460
Did you have a girl
in this apartment?

50:25.500 --> 50:27.460
I trusted you,
you son of a bitch!

50:29.500 --> 50:30.460
How do you like that?

50:32.500 --> 50:33.460
No, I did not.

50:34.500 --> 50:35.460
Fine.

50:39.500 --> 50:40.460
What are you doing?

50:40.500 --> 50:43.460
I'm calling Spend Mart.
They probably want to know...

50:44.500 --> 50:47.460
that they are selling
dirty women's underwear.

50:47.500 --> 50:48.460
Karen, come on,
this whole thing's silly.

50:48.500 --> 50:51.460
I doubt they'll admit
they sell dirty underwear.

50:51.500 --> 50:53.460
I'm sure
it's against corporate policy.

50:57.500 --> 50:59.460
Spend Mart,
where you spend less.

51:00.500 --> 51:03.460
I have a question
regarding your underwear bins.

51:05.500 --> 51:06.460
Underwear bins?

51:09.500 --> 51:11.460
My fiance has informed me...

51:11.500 --> 51:14.460
that he bought a pair of
dirty women's underwear...

51:14.500 --> 51:15.460
out of one of your bins...

51:15.500 --> 51:17.460
and I wanted to hear
your thoughts on this.

51:17.500 --> 51:19.460
My thoughts?
On our underwear bins?

51:25.500 --> 51:27.460
These are my thoughts.
I'm sick of it.

51:29.500 --> 51:31.460
It's some college kids
playing a prank.

51:31.500 --> 51:33.460
They been putting
dirty underwear in our bins.

51:33.500 --> 51:35.460
- What?
- What did he say?

51:36.500 --> 51:39.460
On behalf of Spend Mart,
I'd like to apologize.

51:39.500 --> 51:42.460
Why don't you have
your fiance come down...

51:43.500 --> 51:45.460
and we'll exchange them
for a fresh pair...

51:45.500 --> 51:47.460
or refund your money. OK?

51:52.500 --> 51:53.460
Poor bastard.

51:55.500 --> 51:56.460
Underwear bins?

51:57.500 --> 51:58.460
It's a guy thing.

51:59.500 --> 52:00.460
Bullshit!

52:04.500 --> 52:06.460
God, I am really sorry.
I feel terrible.

52:07.500 --> 52:08.460
It's OK, honey.

52:09.500 --> 52:11.460
I am a terrible person
for accusing you.

52:12.500 --> 52:14.460
No, you are so honest.

52:15.500 --> 52:17.460
I don't deserve you.
Thank you.

52:22.500 --> 52:23.460
I love them.

52:23.500 --> 52:24.460
I knew you would.

52:27.500 --> 52:29.460
Let's just forget about it.

52:29.500 --> 52:31.460
Let's pretend it never happened.

52:32.500 --> 52:35.460
I love you, you love me,
that's all that matters.

52:39.500 --> 52:40.460
One sec!

52:42.500 --> 52:43.460
I got home from work...

52:43.500 --> 52:45.460
and found these pictures
in my son's room.

52:45.500 --> 52:47.460
He was standing over them.

52:51.500 --> 52:53.460
Are we on the same page?

52:53.500 --> 52:54.460
Don't speak!

52:56.500 --> 52:58.460
In the future,
would you find a way...

52:59.500 --> 53:01.460
to dispose of
your pornography...

53:01.500 --> 53:04.460
so it doesn't wind up
in the hands of children?

53:05.500 --> 53:07.460
Absolutely. I apologize.

53:08.500 --> 53:11.460
- Who's at the door?
- Our neighbor, Mr...

53:11.500 --> 53:12.460
Minister Ferris.

53:14.500 --> 53:15.460
Mr. Minister Ferris.

53:15.500 --> 53:17.460
Hello.
I'm Karen, Paul's fiancee.

53:18.500 --> 53:21.460
Congratulations. You move
right along, don't you?

53:26.500 --> 53:29.460
Mr. Minister Ferris stopped by
to recommend a TV special.

53:31.500 --> 53:32.460
Wow, that's great.

53:33.500 --> 53:36.460
Thanks for thinking of us.
We'll keep that...

53:36.500 --> 53:37.460
Son...

53:42.500 --> 53:44.460
I've got my eye on you.

53:48.500 --> 53:49.460
OK, then.

53:51.500 --> 53:53.460
That was awfully
thoughtful of him.

53:53.500 --> 53:55.460
I think he was
checking out your crotch.

53:56.500 --> 53:58.460
Karen, he's a man of the cloth.

53:59.500 --> 54:02.460
Let's not rashly accuse him of
being some weird pecker checker.

54:03.500 --> 54:05.460
I've got to go to the bathroom.

54:05.500 --> 54:06.460
OK.

54:11.500 --> 54:12.460
Shit.

54:22.500 --> 54:23.460
Do you smell smoke?

54:24.500 --> 54:25.460
OK. Oh, shit!

54:29.500 --> 54:31.460
Is something burning?
I smell smoke.

54:31.500 --> 54:33.460
I lit a match,
if you know what I mean.

54:35.500 --> 54:38.460
- Do you still have diarrhea?
- Yeah, I do.

54:50.500 --> 54:53.460
I tell you,
you think you got it licked...

54:53.500 --> 54:56.460
it comes right back
to kick you in the butt.

54:56.500 --> 54:58.460
If this keeps up,
we'll have to plan...

54:58.500 --> 55:01.460
our whole wedding day
around your bowel movements.

55:35.500 --> 55:36.460
Hello?

55:37.500 --> 55:39.460
Hey, Paul, it's Becky.

55:41.500 --> 55:42.460
Jimmy boy! What's up?

55:43.500 --> 55:45.460
Nothing much, Jimmy boy.

55:45.500 --> 55:47.460
I got a visit from
my lunatic ex-fiance.

55:48.500 --> 55:50.460
He's got pictures
of us together.

55:51.500 --> 55:53.460
Hey, baby!
Can I get a gin and tonic...

55:53.500 --> 55:54.460
and maybe you in bed?

55:55.500 --> 55:57.460
I don't know what
he'll do with them...

55:57.500 --> 55:59.460
but he's got
a steroid rage problem...

55:59.500 --> 56:01.460
so I'm thinking
that's not a good thing.

56:01.500 --> 56:02.460
That is great news!

56:03.500 --> 56:04.460
What's going on?

56:05.500 --> 56:07.460
It's Jim.
He got a promotion.

56:07.500 --> 56:08.460
Wow.

56:11.500 --> 56:13.460
Here's the deal.
Ray's working the night shift.

56:13.500 --> 56:16.460
We can sneak into his apartment
and get the negatives.

56:16.500 --> 56:17.460
You're the man, Jim.

56:18.500 --> 56:20.460
Pick me up at 10:00
at the Soho.

56:20.500 --> 56:22.460
You know where that is?

56:22.500 --> 56:24.460
Great. Don't be late
and bring a flashlight.

56:24.500 --> 56:25.460
Wait.
I want to congratulate Jim.

56:25.500 --> 56:26.460
Six bucks?

56:28.500 --> 56:29.460
I wanted to talk.

56:30.500 --> 56:31.460
You did? I'm sorry.

56:35.500 --> 56:37.460
Hello?
I'm so glad you called back.

56:38.500 --> 56:40.460
Congratulations
on the big promotion.

56:41.500 --> 56:43.460
Thanks, Karen.
It was a long time coming.

56:45.500 --> 56:46.460
OK, here's Paul.

56:48.500 --> 56:49.460
- Jim?
- Paul.

56:51.500 --> 56:53.460
You're getting
better at this, buddy.

56:53.500 --> 56:55.460
Hang on, call waiting.

56:55.500 --> 56:56.460
Hello?

56:57.500 --> 56:58.460
- Paul Morse?
- Yeah?

56:58.500 --> 57:00.460
- We found your man.
- You're kidding.

57:10.500 --> 57:12.460
I don't see him in there.
I'm sorry.

57:16.500 --> 57:18.460
Take a good hard look.

57:18.500 --> 57:19.460
Just take your time.

57:20.500 --> 57:22.460
Nope. None of these guys.

57:23.500 --> 57:25.460
Let's motor.
Thank you, gentlemen.

57:33.500 --> 57:36.460
I know he means well,
but I'm ready to get a divorce.

57:38.500 --> 57:41.460
Even the gardener
looks good to me at this point.

57:42.500 --> 57:43.460
The issue is...

57:43.500 --> 57:44.460
Those are my presets!

57:49.500 --> 57:50.460
Who's that?

57:50.500 --> 57:52.460
That's me.
It's for the wedding video.

57:52.500 --> 57:54.460
You were wearing knee socks.

57:55.500 --> 57:58.460
That's a uniform.
A requirement of the troop, OK?

57:58.500 --> 58:00.460
Hat man!
Look at you in that fedora.

58:01.500 --> 58:03.460
Not every kid
can pull that look off.

58:04.500 --> 58:06.460
My mom said
I looked like Indiana Jones.

58:08.500 --> 58:10.460
Your mom loved you very much.

58:21.500 --> 58:23.460
This is it.
We gotta be quick.

58:23.500 --> 58:24.460
Let's lock and load.

58:31.500 --> 58:33.460
Someone is always
expecting someone.

58:34.500 --> 58:36.460
The trick is figuring out who.

58:44.500 --> 58:46.460
- Who's there?
- Get off the buzzer!

58:57.500 --> 58:58.460
Brian, is that you?

59:14.500 --> 59:15.460
Holy shit!

59:16.500 --> 59:18.460
You didn't mention
that Ray had a dog.

59:18.500 --> 59:19.460
What if he wakes up?

59:20.500 --> 59:22.460
Yeah.
I forgot to mention that part.

59:23.500 --> 59:25.460
Just be quiet,
get the pictures...

59:25.500 --> 59:26.460
and get out of here.

59:49.500 --> 59:51.460
What the hell is this?

59:52.500 --> 59:53.460
I found them!

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.460
Wait, what's his name?

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.460
Little Ray.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.460
We should run.

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:11.460
Go! Go! Go!

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:14.460
OK, right here!

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:16.460
Hurry! Close it!

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:21.460
We can handle this.

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:26.460
It's only a dog.
I gotta be smarter than a dog.

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:28.460
OK. Calm down.

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.460
Watch this.
You ready, Little Ray?

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:40.460
Good throw. Yeah.

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:42.460
We're screwed.

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:48.460
- What are we going to do?
- Good question.

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.460
We're stuck in this bathtub.
It could be hours.

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.460
Ray'll come home,
take a shower...

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.460
find us in his bathtub,
and kick my ass!

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:08.460
You're upset.

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.460
- What?
- Plus, you're on my foot.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.460
God, it's asleep.

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.460
I gotta take my boot off.
Help me out.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:15.460
Seriously?

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.460
That is one
weird-looking foot.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:32.460
Didn't stop you from
trying to sleep with it.

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.460
Know what Karen'll do
when she finds out?

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:38.460
- I have an idea.
- She'll call off the wedding.

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:40.460
Her dad's gonna fire me.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:41.460
Maybe getting
fired by Uncle Kenny...

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.460
wouldn't be the worst thing
in the world.

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.460
- It's a good job.
- You like it?

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.460
I sell ad space in hunting
and recreation magazines.

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:49.460
What's not to like?

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:51.460
Wow.

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:52.460
Excuse me...

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:55.460
not everybody can do
whatever they want.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.460
Work five different jobs?

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.460
That's not the way
real life works.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:01:59.460
Do you smell that?

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:02.460
- What?
- Fear.

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:06.460
You've got the smell
of fear all over you.

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.460
Can we switch, please?

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.460
What about you?

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.460
I'm trying some stuff out.
I'd rather do that...

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.460
than get stuck doing
something I don't love.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:24.460
I've never been in a bathtub
with a girl before.

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.460
It's not so bad, is it?

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:27.460
Nah.

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:33.460
I've got an idea.

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.460
If I slide this door open...

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.460
at the same time that
you slide that door open...

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:41.460
we can jump out
while the dog hops in.

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:43.460
- OK?
- OK.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.460
Come on, Little Ray.

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.460
- You ready?
- Ready?

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:02.460
One, two, three!

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.460
Who's the tough dog now?

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.460
Why aren't we going out
the front door?

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:16.460
I'll tell you later.
Come on.

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.460
I get it.
Take the fire escape like on TV.

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:19.460
Keep your voice down!

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:22.460
I can do this. All right.

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:25.460
Come on, let's go!

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.460
I can't.
I'm afraid of heights.

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.460
You just walked down
all these stairs.

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:30.460
This is different.

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.460
It's OK. Come on.
We got to go.

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:34.460
OK. OK.

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:37.460
Just hold onto the rail.

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:39.460
You got it?

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:42.460
See? It drops down.

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:53.460
It wasn't too bad, was it?

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:54.460
Yeah. That was fun.

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:56.460
OK, let's go.

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.460
I can't believe I pulled it off.

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:05.460
"We." We pulled it off.

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:08.460
We could have been stuck
in that tub for hours.

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.460
And I saved your life
on the fire escape.

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.460
You're pretty good at this.
Have you done this before?

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.460
I love this hill!
Hit the gas!

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.460
- What? Here?
- Go! Just trust me!

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:20.460
- All right!
- Go! Go!

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:28.460
Oh, my God!
That was unbelievable!

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.460
I've never done
anything like that!

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:33.460
Can we do that again?

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:34.460
Sure.

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:46.460
That was fun.

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:47.460
Yeah. Good times.

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:52.460
I never thought
I'd do anything like that.

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.460
God, it was just amazing.

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:57.460
You know, in the car?

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:00.460
Anyway...

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:01.460
So, I'll see you...

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.460
At the rehearsal dinner.

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:07.460
OK.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:10.460
Becky?

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.460
You and Ray,
how'd that happen?

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.460
How did I end up with a psycho?

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:18.460
Yeah.

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:20.460
What can I say? Bad taste.

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:21.460
Well...

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:25.460
there aren't too many winners
like me out there.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.460
You joke,
but you really are a good guy.

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.460
Guys like you are hard to find.

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:37.460
Good night.

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.460
Shit.
You gotta be kidding me.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:25.460
Hi!

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:29.460
Caught him with
over an ounce of blow...

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:30.460
in his passenger seat.

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.460
That ought to put him away
for a while.

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:35.460
Great bust, Ray.
Go out and celebrate.

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:38.460
Don't be afraid
to rough him up a little.

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:39.460
He likes it.

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:52.460
What?

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.460
How about you start
from the beginning?

01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:57.460
What beginning?

01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:00.460
He pulled me over,
he put the drugs in my car...

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:02.460
and now I'm here!
What do you mean?

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.460
It wasn't working right,
so I panicked...

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.460
because I had to be somewhere.

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:13.460
And so I ran out,
and that was the dance lesson.

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:14.460
We know. With Howard.

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.460
That Howard.
So incredibly graceful.

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:27.460
You fellas can go.

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.460
- Who are you?
- Internal Affairs.

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:34.460
You were pulled over last night
by Ray Donovan? Is that correct?

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:38.460
- Yeah! But I...
- Do us a favor and shut up.

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:41.460
We know you didn't do anything.

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:42.460
Really?

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.460
Oh, my God.
So I can go home?

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:52.460
It's not that simple.
You need to do something for us.

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:54.460
No. I'm getting
married tomorrow.

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:56.460
I have a rehearsal...

01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:00.460
Listen, stringbean,
we don't care what you want...

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:02.460
This is about what we need.

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:04.460
Yeah.

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:07.460
Remember also
to keep calm and cheerful.

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:11.460
Don't let petty things
get you off course.

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:13.460
No one wants to be a failure.

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:15.460
No one wants a life
constantly filled...

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.460
with worry,
fear, and frustration.

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:19.460
Therefore, remem...

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:21.460
Oh, my God.

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:23.460
Shit, shit, shit.

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:42.460
Hey, mister!

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:46.460
Oh, shit!

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.460
It's Jim.
Where the hell are you?

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.460
This isn't cold feet, is it?

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.460
I'm really confused.
Are you all right?

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:00.460
Shit!

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.460
OK, so I guess
I'll go stand in for you.

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:07.460
Maybe we'll see you
at the rehearsal dinner.

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:15.460
There he is!
Where you been, buddy?

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.460
Karen's got her nuts in a bunch.

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:19.460
Here he is!

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.460
Sorry, I'm late.
I know, I know.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:25.460
- Hi, baby!
- Hi.

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:30.460
There you are.
About time, too.

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:44.460
There's my man!

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:48.460
How did you do this?

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:51.460
It was nothing.
I thought we'd start...

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:54.460
with the tomato boats
with pickle skippers...

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:56.460
and the asparagus
a la toastette.

01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.460
And I got a little
roasted rosemary chicken.

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:02.460
Comes out with a crispy skin,
and it's all moist.

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:06.460
Thank you.

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:11.460
Are you OK?

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:12.460
I think so.

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:16.460
Just a little tired.

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.460
But this is...
This is incredible.

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:24.460
This is... just amazing.

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:28.460
Nice guy.

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:37.460
And just in case
Mom's recipe disappoints...

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:41.460
- You missed the rehearsal!
- I was stuck in traffic.

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:44.460
- Traffic?
- Yeah! Fifty min...

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:46.460
Paul, this is Minister Green.

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:52.460
Let's pray you don't get
stuck in traffic tomorrow.

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.460
From your mouth to God's ears.

01:10:58.500 --> 01:10:59.460
I have to tell you, Paul...

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:02.460
that I put a lot of thought
into tomorrow's ceremony.

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:05.460
It will be somber, sacred...

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:09.460
a reminder of what
the true meaning of marriage is.

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:14.460
- That's nice.
- I'm looking forward to it.

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:16.460
Okey-dokey, dinner's ready!

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:18.460
Ken, Sandy, go over there.

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.460
Honey, why don't you
come over here?

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:22.460
So, Kenny...

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:26.460
what do you think of the condo?

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:27.460
It's great.

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:30.460
It's got a lot of... character.

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:34.460
When I gave up
the bachelor pad...

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:35.460
I said to Dorothy...

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.460
"I'll move in with you
under one condition.

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.460
"It's gotta reflect my style."

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:44.460
The Duke.

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:47.460
Signed by the artist.

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:50.460
Hold on a minute, son.

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:53.460
This is juice.
I prefer the wine.

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:57.460
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Mrs. Cooper...

01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.460
I don't care what you were told.

01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.460
I'm strong for an old lady,
aren't I?

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:06.460
Yes, ma'am.

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:08.460
Wine, please.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.460
Honey, you look
very handsome tonight.

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:17.460
I love that sweater on you.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.460
- Thanks.
- It's very sharp.

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:22.460
Are you having fun?

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.460
- Yeah...
- Absolutely...

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:26.460
Great party.

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:29.460
I know!
And it's all for us!

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:30.460
Yeah.

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.460
I'm gonna slip off
to the powder room.

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:35.460
Go ahead. I'll be here.

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.460
- She's very sweet.
- Yeah, I know.

01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:58.460
I'll be right back.

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:03.460
Check this out.

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:06.460
What is that?

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:09.460
The cops are on to Ray.
They're making me wear this.

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:11.460
They're sitting
outside listening.

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:12.460
Oh, cool.

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.460
Check one. One-Adam-12.

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:19.460
Breaker 1-9,
this is Ex-Tiki Dancer...

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:21.460
- Who is she?
- Some idiot.

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:23.460
What are you doing?

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:24.460
Oh, my God. Sorry.

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.460
I'm wearing a wire.
What are we gonna do?

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.460
This gravy
is absolutely heavenly.

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:36.460
Somebody smells really good.
Know what I'm saying?

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.460
I suddenly realized...

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.460
Did you know this?
I was a surfer.

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:46.460
I had a longboard.

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:49.460
Know what the real
mark of greatness is?

01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:51.460
It's the Duke!

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.460
"Why, thank you, pilgrim."

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:57.460
Out there
riding on the horse...

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.460
man versus nature
versus himself!

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:03.460
Because man
fights his own self...

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.460
to find out
what it is about him...

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:07.460
Everyone?

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.460
I'd like to propose a toast.

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:18.460
To the chicken!

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:20.460
Man, how good is that stuff?

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:26.460
The story of how
Paul and Karen got together...

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:31.460
is old news
to pretty much everybody...

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:35.460
but I like to tell it
because it gives me a chance...

01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:38.460
to remind my brother
that I am the one responsible...

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:40.460
for all of his future happiness.

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:42.460
That's right.
She talked to me first.

01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:46.460
And if I had not been married
at the time...

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:51.460
I would've whisked her
out of that bar so fast...

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:54.460
it would've
straightened out her perm.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.460
I knew right then
that Karen was a special woman.

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.460
She's the kind of woman...

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:13.460
who helps a guy
figure out the answers...

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:18.460
that she would make
an incredible partner...

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:20.460
and a wonderful wife
and mother.

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:28.460
The minute I saw her,
I knew she would be the one.

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.460
And that Paul
would be a happy man...

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.460
for the rest of his days.

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.460
So I raise my glass to Karen.

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.460
I wish both
her and my brother...

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:41.460
all of the happiness
in the world.

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:46.460
Well done, Pete! Well done!

01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:50.460
Nice job!

01:15:57.500 --> 01:15:58.460
You like that, Padre?

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:00.460
It's got a great beat.

01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:02.460
Here's the same thing,
only backwards.

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:09.460
That's Satan, man!

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:17.460
I cannot believe
you mentioned the night we met.

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:19.460
When will you
let me live that down?

01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:21.460
How many stories do I have...

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.460
about attractive women
hitting on me in bars?

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:24.460
I don't know.

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:28.460
Maybe when cute married guys
don't wear wedding rings...

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:30.460
that is the risk they take.

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:33.460
I actually remember the song
playing on the jukebox...

01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:35.460
the night that we met.

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:36.460
Me, too!

01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:38.460
You remember the song
that was playing...

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.460
the night I met Karen?

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.460
It's one of those songs
that sticks in your head...

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:44.460
and ruins years of your life.

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:46.460
No, Pete,
you are surely mistaken.

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:48.460
"Islands in the Stream"
is a great song.

01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:50.460
What does the line...

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.460
When we rely on each other,
uh-huh...

01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:57.460
What does that mean?

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:01.460
It means that they've come
to realize something...

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:03.460
that they rely on each other...

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:06.460
and as they realize that
they say "Uh-huh."

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.460
No, they realized the music
was still going...

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:12.460
and they'd
run out of lyrics...

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.460
so they made up
some nonsense syllables.

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.460
Pete, you're killing me!

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:18.460
- Excuse me.
- That is a beautiful song.

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:22.460
I remember what
you were wearing that night.

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:25.460
You looked so cute,
I thought you had mascara on.

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:27.460
- Hey, Ma.
- Hi, honey.

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:28.460
You got a second?

01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.460
Sure, baby, it's your night.
What?

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.460
- You and Buck.
- Yeah?

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:37.460
You're pretty happy, huh?

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:40.460
Yeah. Very happy.
Your stepfather's different.

01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:43.460
He's very, very different...

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:45.460
but there's
just something about him.

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.460
He gets me.
He lets me be myself.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.460
I've never been happier, honey.

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:56.460
One, two, three, draw!

01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:57.460
I think she got you!

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.460
I've just never been happier.

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:37.460
Who do you have to know...

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:39.460
to get a little
Grey Poupon around here?

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:42.460
Ray!

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:47.460
It's you, in my apartment,
making a sandwich.

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:51.460
It wouldn't kill you to keep
lettuce in the crisper.

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.460
No, it wouldn't, Ray.
Ray's here.

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:57.460
He's coming.
He's right there.

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:01.460
I don't know what you did
to get your butt out of jail...

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:03.460
but you think
you're the only slippery guy...

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:04.460
I've ever dealt with?

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:06.460
No, Ray.

01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:09.460
Do you think planting evidence
is all I got?

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.460
I got a whole bag of tricks...

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.460
including kicking your ass.

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:18.460
You know what?
Bring it on.

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:26.460
Oh, a gift.

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:30.460
How do you like
this package, Ray?

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:38.460
Hey, yo mama!

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:40.460
What did you just say?

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:42.460
What?

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:48.460
I have to ask you to leave now,
seriously.

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:52.460
That's a death lock.
You ain't getting out.

01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:54.460
That's good.

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:56.460
Can I ask you a question?

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:57.460
Yeah, shoot.

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:01.460
How do you cheat
on a girl like Becky?

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:05.460
How do you cheat on a girl
who's funny and beautiful?

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:10.460
Who speaks fluent Chinese?

01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:14.460
Who's afraid of heights?
Which is kind of sweet.

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.460
Who's such a bad dancer.
And those feet.

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:22.460
A girl who's... Sorry.

01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:23.460
Police! Freeze!

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:26.460
Get your hands in the air
or I'll shoot you!

01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:27.460
Where were you guys?

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:29.460
You're going away
for a long time.

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:30.460
Whoa! Wait! Hey!

01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:33.460
For making a sandwich?

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:35.460
We'll take the tape now.

01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:37.460
What? Wow, I...

01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:41.460
Hold on. You were wired?

01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:45.460
Yeah, Ray, I was.

01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:53.460
Son of a bitch!

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:55.460
Get him!

01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:58.460
Get off me!
Get off me, mini-cop!

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:01.460
Thanks for your help.

01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:03.460
Yeah, big man!
Wearing a wire! Asshole!

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:33.460
This is a disaster.

01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:37.460
We didn't all wear bow ties
to school when we were 13.

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.460
I was eccentric.
It was a phase.

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:40.460
Are you OK?

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:43.460
Am I OK?
Let me see, Pete.

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:47.460
I woke up with a tiki dancer
in my bed six days ago...

01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:51.460
then I found out
she was my fiancee's cousin...

01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:54.460
then I got mugged by
her psycho cop ex-boyfriend.

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:55.460
That's right... cop.

01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.460
I broke into his apartment
and stole his property...

01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:00.460
which is a felony...
then I got arrested...

01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:02.460
but not for
breaking and entering...

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:04.460
which is probably what
you were thinking...

01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:06.460
for cocaine possession.

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:08.460
And as a bonus,
I got crabs from a toilet seat.

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:10.460
- That's bad.
- I got rid of them.

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:13.460
Shit! I forgot to book
the string quartet!

01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:14.460
Give me your phone!

01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:17.460
This is going to be fine.

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:19.460
It's going to work out...

01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:20.460
and you and Karen
will be together...

01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:22.460
which is
the most important thing...

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:23.460
because she is...

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:26.460
Pete, don't start, please!

01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:28.460
- Yeah?
- Jim!

01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:30.460
I forgot to book
the string quartet.

01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:33.460
Jimmy anticipated as much,
and I got you covered.

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:35.460
Oh, my God,
thank you so much.

01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:36.460
Late!

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:39.460
He's on it.

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.460
Everything's going to be fine.

01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:42.460
- How do I look?
- Great.

01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:43.460
See you out there.

01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:45.460
All right, thanks.

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:52.460
Oh, my God.

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:07.460
Ken! Mr. Cooper!
I didn't...

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:10.460
Were you in that stall
the whole time?

01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:14.460
I'll tell you
what I'm going to do.

01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:17.460
I'm going to overlook
what I just heard.

01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:20.460
I believe
that you love my daughter.

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.460
And in spite of everything...

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:28.460
you're going to make her happy.

01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:30.460
Am I right?

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:32.460
Yeah, but I can explain...

01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:34.460
I don't want to hear it.
What's done is done.

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:36.460
But, sir,
I didn't actually do...

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:37.460
Paul, forget it.

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:41.460
We're men. We're hunters.

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:44.460
It happens.

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.460
Here. It's a butter dish.

01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:11.460
And I just gave away
the surprise.

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:12.460
Thanks.

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:15.460
I know that a lot of weird...

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:20.460
fun weird things
happened recently.

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:24.460
You know that stuff
I said about taking chances?

01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:26.460
That was all bullshit.

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:28.460
You're a great guy...

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:32.460
and Karen's a great girl,
so congratulations.

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:34.460
See you in there.

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:43.460
How about those pants?
Those look good.

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:47.460
- Hey, Buck!
- How are you?

01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:49.460
- Pretty big deal.
- Hi, Sandy!

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:54.460
- Sorry.
- Music all set?

01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:56.460
- It's all good.
- You're a little late.

01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:57.460
Sorry. Tonya. Chicks.

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:01.460
You brought Tonya?

01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:03.460
Yeah. I figured
I'd throw her a bone...

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:07.460
before I dumped her.

01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:09.460
Hi, Jim.

01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:12.460
I need my lipstick, baby.
Where is it?

01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:16.460
What the heck?
How'd that get in there?

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:19.460
Hey, Paul.

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:23.460
We met at your bachelor party.
I'm Tonya.

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:24.460
Yeah. I remember.

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:28.460
You! You didn't warn me
about this cuddle monkey.

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:33.460
He's been writing me poems
and sending me flowers.

01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.460
Whoa, Tonya.
lx-nay on the oem-pay.

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:39.460
Two days and he gave me
the keys to his apartment.

01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:40.460
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:45.460
I love you, cuddle monkey.

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:47.460
Love you, too... honey bear.

01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:51.460
OK. Good luck.

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:57.460
Maybe I love her a little bit.

01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:59.460
You ready?
Let's do this.

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:02.460
I almost forgot.
The minister's sick.

01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:04.460
Something about
the food last night.

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:06.460
What are you talking about?

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.460
Who's going to marry us?

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:16.460
Showtime.

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:25.460
Who are they?

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:28.460
What the hell is that?

01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:30.460
Howard!

01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:33.460
I know, I know.
It's rock and roll...

01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:36.460
but we just need
to find the beat.

01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:42.460
What do you think?
Pretty sweet?

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:46.460
- Is this really necessary?
- Take my arm.

01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:47.460
- Take it!
- Take it!

01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:52.460
So pretty!

01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:57.460
I'm Daddy's little girl,
and you're my great big man.

01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.460
Now, take me, hold me tight.

01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:07.460
One, two, now fly...

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:09.460
Sorry, dear!

01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:14.460
You're flying, sweeties!
Can you feel it?

01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:52.460
Is this some kind of joke?

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.460
This is so embarrassing.

01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:56.460
I tried.
People like it, OK?

01:27:57.500 --> 01:27:59.460
- It's not that bad.
- It sounds like a clam bake!

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:02.460
I had no choice.
I forgot the string quartet.

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:04.460
I give you one thing to do.

01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:07.460
- Why did you pick a band?
- I didn't do it!

01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:16.460
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today...

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:20.460
in the sight of God...

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:24.460
...in order to join
this woman, Karen...

01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:27.460
and this man, Paul...

01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:32.460
in holy matrimony.

01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:35.460
If there is
anyone here today...

01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:39.460
who believes that these two
should not be joined...

01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:41.460
for all eternity...

01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:47.460
let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:02.460
We're going to give you
another minute or so...

01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:03.460
to think about that.

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:07.460
Anybody?

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.460
Anyone at all.
Anyone with a reason.

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:20.460
It doesn't even
have to be a good reason.

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:23.460
If anyone even has
a whisper of a feeling...

01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:25.460
that's enough.

01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:27.460
That's good enough.

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:33.460
I do.

01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:45.460
Hi. I'm Paul.

01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:49.460
Hi, Paul.

01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:53.460
I think I need to tell
you all something...

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:55.460
before we go any further.

01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:01.460
What's happening?

01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:03.460
I've done some things
this past week...

01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:05.460
that I'm not proud of.

01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:08.460
And people kept telling me...

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:10.460
"Don't worry about it.
It's normal."

01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:14.460
But I think they're wrong.

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:19.460
And I'm going down a road
I don't like.

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:23.460
I don't want to be that guy.

01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:25.460
You know what I mean?

01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:28.460
This is like an AA meeting.

01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:31.460
I was talking about fear
the other day with someone...

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:38.460
and it made me realize
that I can't remember...

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:40.460
the last time I've been afraid.

01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:43.460
I mean, really afraid.

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:46.460
I've been playing it safe.

01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:48.460
Everything I do is safe.

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:51.460
And marrying Karen...

01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:56.460
That's not scary at all.

01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:03.460
She's beautiful, she's funny,
she's smart...

01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:08.460
she's perfect in so many ways...

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:12.460
but deep down,
we're not right for each other.

01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:18.460
Oh, God. Oh, no.

01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:23.460
Saying that was scary.

01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:41.460
Mr. Minister Ferris?

01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:45.460
Yes, Paul.

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:48.460
I don't think Karen and I
should be joined for eternity.

01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:57.460
Uh-huh...

01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:00.460
What's that, Pete?

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:06.460
I just realized something
about somebody...

01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:08.460
and it made me say... Uh-huh.

01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:13.460
That's great, but
I'm in the middle of something.

01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:17.460
Islands in the stream

01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:19.460
That is what we are

01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:23.460
No one in between

01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:27.460
How could we be wrong?

01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:30.460
Sail away with me

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:33.460
To another world

01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:38.460
Because we rely on each other

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:40.460
Uh-huh

01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:45.460
What I realized is
that I'm in love with Karen.

01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:50.460
What the hell is going on here?

01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:51.460
Shut your yapping.

01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:54.460
Now, this is a wedding.

01:32:57.500 --> 01:33:00.460
Paul, would you mind
if I asked Karen to marry me?

01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:02.460
Thank you. Karen?

01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:06.460
Pete, God, I'd have to...

01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:09.460
Well, not right here,
not right now...

01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:12.460
but maybe after a few dates.

01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:15.460
Oh, Pete!

01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:35.460
It's OK. I'm OK.

01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:51.460
These are the days.

01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:11.460
Kenny, the good news is
we'll still be in-laws.

01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:13.460
Lady, you forget somebody?

01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:16.460
Stop the cab.

01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:22.460
Asshole!

01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:32.460
I was gonna wait for you.

01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:34.460
You were great in there.

01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:35.460
Listen. I just...

01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:41.460
I think I just figured
something out back there.

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.460
Because what I said...

01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:48.460
I don't think I would
have been able to say...

01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:49.460
if it wasn't for you.

01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:55.460
And it also made me
realize something else.

01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:58.460
What?

01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:02.460
This.

01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:56.460
Where to, Whitey?
