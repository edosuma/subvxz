[footsteps rustling]

01:18.034 --> 01:19.253
- I thought you said two.

01:19.340 --> 01:20.167
- I know.

01:20.254 --> 01:21.081
I'm late.

01:24.519 --> 01:26.173
- I didn't think
you were gonna show.

01:26.260 --> 01:27.913
- I asked you to come, didn't I?

01:29.306 --> 01:30.177
- I know you did.

01:32.266 --> 01:35.617
I just thought after last time.

01:35.704 --> 01:38.185
- Yeah. Well, you really
fucking scared me last time.

01:41.449 --> 01:42.276
- I know.

01:52.155 --> 01:53.113
How are you?

01:56.899 --> 01:59.336
- I can't stop thinking
about what she looks like.

02:01.251 --> 02:02.731
I never thought I
would have to remember

02:02.818 --> 02:04.428
what my sister looked like but,

02:06.735 --> 02:08.780
she doesn't look like
me anymore, does she?

02:15.178 --> 02:18.007
I was reading that they get
this thing called purge,

02:18.094 --> 02:19.574
where their mouths start to leak

02:19.661 --> 02:21.619
this like brown fluid from
- Stop Ava, Jesus.

02:23.186 --> 02:25.406
I don't wanna talk about that.

02:25.493 --> 02:26.320
- Sorry.

02:27.886 --> 02:29.410
I can't stop thinking about it.

02:34.502 --> 02:35.851
- I need an answer, Ava.

02:38.245 --> 02:40.334
- Is it weird for
you, seeing me?

02:41.378 --> 02:42.379
Cause I look like her.

02:43.511 --> 02:45.034
My dad says it's hard.

02:48.385 --> 02:49.952
- He shouldn't say that to you.

02:50.039 --> 02:51.083
- Yeah. Well he does.

02:53.303 --> 02:55.175
- [Jamie] Do you see them much?

02:57.264 --> 02:58.265
- No, they just...

03:02.660 --> 03:05.402
Jules was the only one who
ever really felt like family.

03:09.493 --> 03:11.626
- I think she was like
this for a lot of people.

03:11.713 --> 03:13.628
- Yeah. Well, for
me she actually was.

03:18.894 --> 03:20.156
- This wasn't a good idea.

03:20.243 --> 03:21.418
I can't keep doing this.

03:26.597 --> 03:29.426
You never looked the same to me.

03:29.513 --> 03:31.211
I could always
tell you two apart.

03:35.693 --> 03:36.912
- Can you really do it?

03:38.305 --> 03:39.131
Jamie!

03:47.139 --> 03:48.228
Can you really do it?

03:50.926 --> 03:51.753
- Yeah.

03:53.407 --> 03:55.887
But I can't do it without you.

04:00.370 --> 04:01.153
- Okay.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.852
[ominous music]

04:16.430 --> 04:17.866
- Ava, if we're gonna do this...

04:17.953 --> 04:19.041
- I said okay.

04:26.178 --> 04:29.269
- We should probably go
somewhere inside, talk.

04:57.514 --> 05:00.125
[chime clinks]

05:24.324 --> 05:26.413
- [Ava] Wait, you knew?

05:26.500 --> 05:27.283
- [Jamie] We started late.

05:27.370 --> 05:28.763
Of course I knew.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.330
- Weddings always start
a few minutes late.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.332
- It was almost a half an hour.

05:33.550 --> 05:34.986
I had to stand up there

05:35.073 --> 05:37.641
while your mother
explained to everyone

05:37.728 --> 05:39.121
how important it is for a woman

05:39.208 --> 05:41.123
to know how to change
a tire for herself.

05:41.210 --> 05:42.820
- To be fair, she had
been drinking all day.

05:42.907 --> 05:46.346
- And yet she
enunciated so well.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.391
- Wait, how did you
know Jules was sick?

05:49.349 --> 05:51.046
- Cause I know her.

05:51.133 --> 05:54.049
And I know what someone with
food poisoning looks like.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.053
- Yeah, it was bad. [giggling]

05:59.228 --> 06:01.143
- I just don't know why
you guys try to hide it.

06:01.230 --> 06:03.275
Like I could tell she was
sick the second I saw her.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.191
- She didn't want you to
be all, you know, you.

06:09.891 --> 06:11.545
- What does that mean?

06:11.632 --> 06:13.329
- Just that if you
knew Jules was sick,

06:13.416 --> 06:15.200
you would have wanted
to take care of her.

06:15.287 --> 06:16.985
- And that's a bad thing?

06:17.072 --> 06:18.682
- No, she just didn't
want you to worry.

06:18.769 --> 06:20.336
- That's my job.

06:20.423 --> 06:21.816
- No, that was my job.

06:21.903 --> 06:23.731
That's literally the
maid of honor's job.

06:23.818 --> 06:25.167
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah.

06:25.254 --> 06:27.125
I mean, you always
have to fix everything.

06:31.652 --> 06:34.176
[car roaring]

06:38.659 --> 06:40.617
- What did you tell people?

06:40.704 --> 06:41.966
- What do you mean?

06:42.053 --> 06:43.141
- About where you are?

06:44.534 --> 06:45.317
- I didn't.

06:46.231 --> 06:47.102
- You didn't?

06:52.716 --> 06:54.588
Aren't you planning on staying?

06:55.937 --> 06:58.983
- Yeah and I will, if there's
something to stay for.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.681
- What about your job?

07:00.768 --> 07:03.031
- Doesn't matter, as long
as I get my shifts covered.

07:03.118 --> 07:06.034
Which is easy, cause tips
are the best on the weekends.

07:06.121 --> 07:08.515
You never did the
bar thing, did you?

07:08.602 --> 07:10.386
- I didn't, no.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.257
- Are you gonna go
back to work now?

07:13.911 --> 07:14.738
- I guess.

07:15.739 --> 07:16.784
I don't know.

07:16.871 --> 07:18.263
I haven't thought about it much.

07:18.350 --> 07:20.875
It just doesn't seem
that important nowadays.

07:20.962 --> 07:23.268
- Spoken like someone
with a savings account.

07:24.574 --> 07:25.923
- Well,

07:26.010 --> 07:27.534
Not anymore.

07:27.621 --> 07:29.753
- Oh. Well, welcome to the club.

07:30.928 --> 07:32.800
- Glad I'm finally
cool enough for you.

07:32.887 --> 07:34.410
- No, you're not. [giggling]

[car wheels screeching]

07:40.590 --> 07:43.288
What the hell was that?

07:48.685 --> 07:50.208
What? What was it?

07:51.732 --> 07:52.733
- I'm sorry.

07:53.951 --> 07:56.214
I don't know what happened.

08:00.610 --> 08:01.437
- Are you okay?

08:02.438 --> 08:04.092
- Yeah. Yeah.

08:04.179 --> 08:05.006
I'm fine.

08:06.181 --> 08:09.227
[car engine roaring]

08:24.373 --> 08:25.766
We should probably get gas.

08:59.016 --> 09:01.149
- I know. I know.

09:01.236 --> 09:02.150
- What?

09:02.237 --> 09:03.107
- It's bad for me.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.327
I get it.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.417
- No. Wait.

09:08.504 --> 09:09.331
Finish it.

09:14.597 --> 09:15.555
I'll be in the car.

[car door slams]

09:29.743 --> 09:32.441
[ominous music]

10:24.972 --> 10:26.408
- Do you wanna talk about it?

10:27.801 --> 10:29.280
- I told you I'm fine.

10:31.674 --> 10:32.806
- I meant the accident.

10:38.681 --> 10:43.077
I know I'm not Jules,
but you can talk to me.

10:43.164 --> 10:45.253
- There's nothing to talk about.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.820
- You can't keep saying that.

10:48.430 --> 10:50.911
Whatever happens tonight,
doesn't erase anything.

10:50.998 --> 10:52.521
You still have to deal with it.

10:54.305 --> 10:55.872
- I am dealing with it.

10:59.571 --> 11:01.617
- That's not what I mean.

11:03.619 --> 11:05.882
You can't just pretend
it didn't happen.

11:06.840 --> 11:07.754
If you ignore it,

11:10.191 --> 11:11.540
you end up hurting people.

11:19.548 --> 11:24.335
Jamie, a year ago, your
wife died on this road,

11:24.422 --> 11:25.641
in a car you were driving and-

11:25.728 --> 11:27.382
- She didn't die in the car.

11:27.469 --> 11:31.603
- What?
- She didn't die in the car.

11:32.996 --> 11:34.215
She was thrown.

11:38.480 --> 11:39.307
- Oh.

11:41.831 --> 11:42.963
I didn't know.

11:47.358 --> 11:49.796
Through the windshield?
- Stop.

11:53.147 --> 11:54.452
- I didn't know.

11:58.892 --> 12:01.721
So when you say the
place where she died,

12:01.808 --> 12:04.462
you don't just mean where
the accident happened, you-

12:04.549 --> 12:05.333
- Yeah.

12:14.342 --> 12:16.083
- Look, all I'm saying is
that it would make sense

12:16.170 --> 12:17.084
if this was hard.

12:18.085 --> 12:19.260
Being back here with me.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.574
Could you really tell us apart?

12:30.837 --> 12:32.055
- What?

12:32.142 --> 12:32.969
- Me and Jules.

12:34.405 --> 12:35.580
You said you could
always tell us apart.

12:35.667 --> 12:36.494
Is that true?

12:39.280 --> 12:40.107
How?

12:42.849 --> 12:45.068
- You always smelled
like cigarettes.

12:46.809 --> 12:47.854
[Ava laughing]

12:47.941 --> 12:49.507
- You fucking suck.

12:55.035 --> 12:55.818
- We're here.

12:59.430 --> 13:01.128
- But how can you tell?

13:01.215 --> 13:02.564
The tree.

13:09.658 --> 13:12.400
[keys jangling]

13:20.930 --> 13:23.672
[car door slams]

13:47.217 --> 13:48.566
Everything okay?

13:56.879 --> 13:57.749
Hey, you okay?

13:58.794 --> 14:00.143
- What are we doing, Jamie?

14:01.623 --> 14:02.798
- No.

14:02.885 --> 14:03.799
No. No. No. No.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.322
Ava, don't do this.

14:05.409 --> 14:06.628
- I'm not even afraid
it won't work anymore.

14:06.715 --> 14:07.716
- It'll work.

14:07.803 --> 14:08.804
- You're not listening to me.

14:08.891 --> 14:09.761
- I am lis...

14:15.811 --> 14:16.943
We're ready.

14:17.030 --> 14:18.031
You're ready.

14:23.558 --> 14:26.213
- What if we're doing
the wrong thing?

14:30.913 --> 14:32.219
- Please look at me.

14:32.306 --> 14:34.134
We're not doing the
wrong thing, okay?

14:42.229 --> 14:43.186
Do you know where we were going

14:43.273 --> 14:44.579
the night of the accident?

14:49.062 --> 14:50.411
To get a book.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.980
Her bag got stolen
out of her car

14:54.067 --> 14:57.157
and she lost this book she'd
borrowed from a friend.

14:57.244 --> 14:58.810
It was old.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.335
Margin's full of notes,
I guess, irreplaceable.

15:01.422 --> 15:02.249
But,

15:03.772 --> 15:05.295
Jules felt responsible.

15:07.428 --> 15:08.777
So,

15:08.864 --> 15:11.127
she tracked down the
first edition copy,

15:11.214 --> 15:13.173
and had it shipped
to a store in town.

15:15.262 --> 15:17.481
That night we were on
our way to pick it up.

15:23.444 --> 15:27.361
Jules always took
responsibility,

15:27.448 --> 15:29.189
even when it wasn't
hers to take.

15:31.104 --> 15:32.932
And she's dead because

15:34.455 --> 15:37.153
some drunk idiot decided
to get into his car.

15:40.113 --> 15:41.418
There isn't right or wrong.

15:41.505 --> 15:43.159
There's just what happens.

15:44.813 --> 15:45.640
I mean,

15:46.641 --> 15:47.947
Jules was killed.

15:51.515 --> 15:53.648
Tonight we're gonna
bring her back.

15:55.084 --> 15:57.739
[ominous music]

16:18.716 --> 16:19.543
This is it.

16:27.682 --> 16:28.509
C'mon.

16:31.338 --> 16:32.861
- What if she's not her?

16:32.948 --> 16:34.297
- What?

16:34.384 --> 16:36.038
- What if she's wrong?

16:36.125 --> 16:37.735
Like what if she's
something else?

16:37.822 --> 16:39.563
- That won't happen.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.391
- But if it does?

16:41.478 --> 16:45.134
Can you put it back, is there-
- That's not gonna happen.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.223
- Jamie please just
answer the question.

16:49.530 --> 16:50.270
- Yeah.

16:50.357 --> 16:51.401
I can fix it.

17:08.592 --> 17:11.247
[ominous music]

17:35.967 --> 17:37.012
Here.

17:37.099 --> 17:37.926
- Thanks.

17:51.679 --> 17:53.028
- Are you ready?

18:21.448 --> 18:22.797
Just like we practiced.

18:22.884 --> 18:24.277
I'll be here the whole time.

18:25.321 --> 18:28.019
[ominous music]

18:41.990 --> 18:42.730
Is that tight enough?

18:42.817 --> 18:43.557
- It's good.

18:43.644 --> 18:46.299
[ominous music]

18:54.655 --> 18:56.135
- Bringing you down.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.685
I'm gonna do the wine now.

19:24.772 --> 19:26.382
I'll let you know
when I'm ready.

19:26.469 --> 19:27.296
- Okay.

20:08.772 --> 20:09.643
You're done.

20:09.730 --> 20:10.557
- Almost.

20:19.653 --> 20:21.045
Okay.

20:21.132 --> 20:22.221
- You're not looking?

20:23.918 --> 20:24.745
- All good.

20:25.746 --> 20:26.573
- Okay.

[lighter flick]

[lighter flick]

20:36.974 --> 20:37.801
[lighter flick]

20:43.111 --> 20:44.330
- Everything all right?

20:44.417 --> 20:45.853
- Yeah. I just
can't fucking see.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.637
- It's okay. Just breathe.

20:49.030 --> 20:49.813
[lighter flick]

20:53.295 --> 20:54.340
- It's okay, I got it.

21:11.618 --> 21:12.793
Okay. It's lit.

the hell was that?

22:11.330 --> 22:12.983

22:13.854 --> 22:15.421
- Something's here, something--

22:15.508 --> 22:16.683
Did you see anything?

22:16.770 --> 22:19.076
- No. I couldn't look.

22:19.163 --> 22:19.990
- Fuck.

22:20.077 --> 22:20.817
- Here, here.

22:20.904 --> 22:22.341
Lemme see.

22:27.824 --> 22:29.565
- I wanna go back to the car!

22:29.652 --> 22:31.393
- Okay, okay. Let's
just take a minute.

22:31.480 --> 22:34.222
- Jamie something was
here and it wasn't Jules.

22:34.309 --> 22:35.876

22:35.963 --> 22:37.965
- No, I-
- No, no, no, Ava, Ava.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.709
I think you're
supposed to stay here.

22:42.796 --> 22:44.014
- No, no.

22:44.101 --> 22:45.973
- I think that
this is part of it.

22:46.060 --> 22:46.887
I think,

22:48.192 --> 22:51.544
you're supposed to bleed here.

22:51.631 --> 22:54.460
We knew it had to be
done by a blood relative.

22:54.547 --> 22:55.504
I'm sorry.

22:55.591 --> 22:56.853
I should have realized it.

22:58.725 --> 23:00.204
Obviously, we'd need blood.

I'm sorry.

Are you, are you

Are you doing okay?

24:22.635 --> 24:23.462

24:25.638 --> 24:26.987
Thank God you apparently keep

24:27.074 --> 24:28.771

24:44.004 --> 24:45.484
You didn't answer me.

- Answer what?

24:47.660 --> 24:48.835
- Before.

24:48.922 --> 24:50.924
You just stopped talking

24:51.011 --> 24:52.316
and I kept calling your name,

24:52.403 --> 24:53.448
and it was like you
weren't even there.

24:55.102 --> 24:56.669
- I didn't hear you say my name.

24:58.409 --> 24:59.236
- What?

25:05.112 --> 25:06.766
- I couldn't hear you.

25:06.853 --> 25:08.071
It was like you disappeared.

I didn't know what was happening

25:09.508 --> 25:11.118
and I knew I wasn't
supposed to look.

25:12.511 --> 25:15.514
And then, you were screaming.

25:20.997 --> 25:24.000
- Do you think that
means it worked?

25:27.917 --> 25:28.744
Good.

He didn't say.

25:42.236 --> 25:43.585
- I'm gonna sit in the car.

- Ava,

25:48.503 --> 25:49.591
sorry you got hurt.

You were right.

27:17.766 --> 27:18.724
It makes sense.

27:18.811 --> 27:21.422
I just wasn't expecting it.

27:26.688 --> 27:27.907
Thank you for doing this.

27:30.823 --> 27:31.780
- You don't need to thank me.

27:31.867 --> 27:33.390
- No, I'm serious.

27:35.305 --> 27:39.135
Look, I don't know what
happens after tonight.

27:42.095 --> 27:43.749
Those first couple of months.

27:47.970 --> 27:50.494
I remember there was a day
I couldn't stop crying.

27:52.409 --> 27:55.064
At a certain point I
wasn't even sad anymore,

27:55.151 --> 27:56.457
I just kept going.

27:59.547 --> 28:01.462
And I realized I had
this idea in my head.

28:01.549 --> 28:05.292
That if I cried hard enough,

28:06.641 --> 28:07.686
I could get her back.

28:09.862 --> 28:13.039
Like if I hurt enough,
I could prove something.

28:14.693 --> 28:15.606
I could change it.

28:18.566 --> 28:21.090
You figured out how to do it.

28:21.177 --> 28:23.571
Yeah. You figured out
how to actually do it.

28:26.574 --> 28:27.706
I don't know.

28:29.577 --> 28:30.404
Thank you.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.322
- I wish I could have
kept you out of it.

28:35.409 --> 28:36.410
- Don't, I'm

28:37.367 --> 28:39.369

sleep in our bed.

It's been a year, and I still...

28:52.469 --> 28:54.123
You know, sometimes
I try it, but

28:57.083 --> 28:58.824
I just end up lying
there in the dark,

28:58.911 --> 29:01.478
and wait until I
moved to the couch.

29:35.991 --> 29:37.384
Okay, it was the first
Christmas we were in college.

29:37.471 --> 29:39.168
And initially we went
to different colleges.

29:39.255 --> 29:40.735
It was like a thing.

We weren't going to be the twins

29:41.910 --> 29:43.912
that did everything together.

the first week,

we were both so
miserable that we...

still sometimes have moments
