00:02.035 --> 00:04.437
<i>( bell rings )</i>

00:04.471 --> 00:07.540
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:07.574 --> 00:10.443
<i>* I don't think</i>
<i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:10.477 --> 00:13.380
<i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
<i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:13.413 --> 00:16.983
<i>* I'm at the corner</i>
<i>just in time</i>
<i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:17.017 --> 00:22.555
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:22.589 --> 00:25.892
<i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
<i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:25.925 --> 00:28.862
<i>* And my dog ate</i>
<i>all my homework last night</i>

00:28.895 --> 00:31.564
<i>* Ridin' low in my chair</i>
<i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

00:31.598 --> 00:35.168
<i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>
<i>it'll be all right</i>

00:35.201 --> 00:39.472
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:53.653 --> 00:56.990
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

00:57.023 --> 00:59.492
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

00:59.526 --> 01:03.163
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:12.572 --> 01:14.874
It's Saturday morning
and we're in school.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.242
Depressing, isn't it?

01:16.276 --> 01:18.345
We're here to take
this test called the SAT.

01:18.378 --> 01:21.147
I'd rather be at the beach
working on my TAN.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.520
You are about to take

01:27.554 --> 01:30.890
<i>the</i> most important
test of your lives.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.893
This is the test
that colleges look at

01:33.927 --> 01:36.096
when they decide who to admit.

01:36.129 --> 01:38.565
The next three hours
might well determine

01:38.598 --> 01:41.368
your entire future.

01:41.401 --> 01:43.570
But I don't want to put
any pressure on you,

01:43.603 --> 01:46.106
so just relax, have fun,
and do the best you can.

01:46.106 --> 01:49.509
Have fun? All right,
then I'm going to the beach.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.978
Wrong.

01:55.248 --> 01:56.850
Remember, everyone,

01:56.883 --> 02:02.255
this test will be taken
in absolute silence.

02:02.288 --> 02:05.058
- ( whirrs )
- All: Shh!

02:07.127 --> 02:10.096
Jessie's voice:
<i>I've been waiting</i>
<i>for this test my whole life.</i>

02:10.130 --> 02:13.533
<i>I'm a lean, mean</i>
<i>answering machine!</i>

02:13.566 --> 02:16.503
<i>Stansbury University,</i>
<i>here I come!</i>

02:19.272 --> 02:21.474
Kelly's voice: <i>She's on</i>
<i>the third page already?!</i>

02:21.508 --> 02:23.576
<i>I'm still on</i>
<i>the third question!</i>

02:23.610 --> 02:25.945
<i>I hate her!</i>

02:29.082 --> 02:32.886
Lisa's voice:
<i>"And if train</i>
<i>A leaves New York at 5:00,</i>

02:32.919 --> 02:35.922
<i>and train B leaves</i>
<i>Los Angeles at 2:00,</i>

02:35.955 --> 02:40.827
<i>where will they meet?"</i>
<i>Probably with</i>
<i>a big bang in Missouri.</i>

02:43.296 --> 02:45.598
Slater's voice:
<i>Concentrate,</i>
<i>Slater, concentrate.</i>

02:45.632 --> 02:47.267
<i>How can I concentrate?</i>
<i>I'm starving!</i>

02:47.300 --> 02:51.471
<i>I only had four Twinkies and</i>
<i>a box of Ding</i>
<i>Dongs for breakfast.</i>

02:53.206 --> 02:55.575
<i>Zack's voice:</i>
<i>Mmm, Belding was right.</i>

02:55.608 --> 02:58.111
<i>This test is important</i>
<i>to my future.</i>

02:58.111 --> 03:01.047
<i>Who is that great-looking</i>
<i>chick over there?</i>

03:04.184 --> 03:06.252
Screech's voice:
<i>Mmmm, pencils, erasers,</i>

03:06.286 --> 03:08.388
<i>vitamins, protein drink.</i>

03:08.421 --> 03:10.490
<i>I got everything I need.</i>

03:10.523 --> 03:15.061
<i>Oh no!</i>
<i>I forgot to kiss</i>
<i>my lucky goldfish!</i>

03:15.061 --> 03:18.064
<i>Pucker up, baby,</i>
<i>Daddy needs good luck!</i>

03:23.103 --> 03:25.138
I can't wait much longer
to find out my score.

03:25.171 --> 03:27.173
Where is Zack?
He promised he'd meet us here

03:27.207 --> 03:29.275
so we could all open
our envelopes together.

03:29.309 --> 03:32.078
This is so exciting!
It's like
the People's Choice Awards!

03:32.112 --> 03:35.482
If the people had a choice,
you'd be on another planet.

03:37.317 --> 03:40.120
Hey, everybody, let's get this
little ceremony over with.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.855
There are girls
l still have to meet.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.891
- Good day, everybody!
- All: Hey, James!

03:44.924 --> 03:47.093
- James,
you're working here again?
- Yeah.

03:47.093 --> 03:49.129
- I thought you
got a part in a play.
- I did.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.097
We performed "Cats"
in dog suits,

03:51.131 --> 03:54.367
but I quit when they
started throwing bones at us.

03:54.401 --> 03:57.504
- So what will it be?
- We're too
nervous to eat right now.

03:57.537 --> 03:59.205
Speak for yourselves.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.841
I'll have a burger, fries
and a double chocolate malt.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.343
- Got it.
- All right.

04:03.376 --> 04:07.047
Okay, guys, time
to find out our scores.

04:08.882 --> 04:12.218
Well, somebody's
got to go first.

04:12.952 --> 04:15.188
Screech, you do it.

04:19.091 --> 04:21.528
689 in math.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.496
531 in verbal.

04:23.530 --> 04:26.399
- A combined score of 1220!
- ( all cheer )

04:26.433 --> 04:28.401
1200 is good, Screech.

04:28.435 --> 04:31.271
1600 is the best you can get.
And only geniuses get that.

04:31.304 --> 04:33.807
Right.
Hey, open yours up, Mama.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.176
No, you guys go first.

04:40.180 --> 04:42.148
1100. Not bad!

04:42.182 --> 04:44.818
1140! I'm happy!

04:44.851 --> 04:47.387
1050.

04:47.420 --> 04:51.157
- That's a good score, Slater.
- It's way above
the national average.

04:51.191 --> 04:53.827
Besides, in every group,
some dummy's got
to get the lowest.

04:55.595 --> 04:57.597
Yeah, well, don't be so sure
I'm the lowest.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.600
Zack over here hasn't
opened his up yet.

05:00.633 --> 05:04.037
Do the honors, Screech.
Make Mr.
Musclehead here happy.

05:08.274 --> 05:09.909
750...

05:09.943 --> 05:11.845
Way to go, Preppie!

05:11.878 --> 05:14.047
- ...in math!
- What?

05:14.047 --> 05:16.383
752 in verbal?

05:16.416 --> 05:20.086
- Total score of 1502!
- Huh-uh.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.789
Wow, Zack's even smarter
than Doogie Howser!

05:25.558 --> 05:28.828
- I am? Check this out. I am!
- I don't believe it.

05:28.862 --> 05:33.066
The SAT measures
how smart you are,
not how hard you work.

05:33.066 --> 05:36.503
Zack may be lazy,
but he's no idiot.

05:36.536 --> 05:39.172
Thank you, Screech.
You're a pal.

05:39.205 --> 05:42.409
Jessie, if Zack got 1500,
you must have
scored off the charts!

05:42.442 --> 05:46.179
Yeah, open yours up, Mama,
maybe you aced it-- 1600.

05:55.488 --> 05:58.091
1205?!

05:58.091 --> 06:01.795
- 1205?!
- That's a good score, Jessie.

06:01.828 --> 06:04.764
Yeah, it's only 297 points
less than Zack.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.936
My life as I know it
is over.

06:11.271 --> 06:13.239
Excuse me.
I'm Heather Brooks.

06:13.273 --> 06:16.509
Wow, I overheard your score.
Congratulations.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.312
For once, my score
is going to help me score!

06:19.346 --> 06:21.481
Thank you very much.
I'm Zack Morris,

06:21.514 --> 06:24.351
and I also bowled a 241.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.086
Mr. Belding, over PA:
<i>Attention, all students.</i>

06:26.119 --> 06:30.223
<i>College representatives</i>
<i>will be In the gym for</i>
<i>the next three days.</i>

06:30.256 --> 06:32.892
<i>So stop in and tell them</i>
<i>Mr. Belding sent you.</i>

06:32.926 --> 06:36.229
<i>You'll get a free cookie.</i>
<i>( laughs )</i>

06:36.262 --> 06:38.264
I'm planning on going there
after school.

06:38.298 --> 06:40.934
Oh-- yeah, me too.
I guess I'll see you there.

06:40.967 --> 06:43.336
- Can I walk you
to your next class?
- Yeah.

06:48.908 --> 06:51.311
- Hi, Jessie.
- Hi, Darlene.
How are you doing?

06:51.344 --> 06:52.746
I am fantastic.

06:52.779 --> 06:57.283
I bet it's doodily compared
to you, but I just got
a 1280 on my SATs!

06:57.317 --> 07:00.153
- What did you get?
- I'd rather not say.

07:00.186 --> 07:02.756
I don't want to make
anybody feel bad...

07:03.523 --> 07:05.458
especially stupid me.

07:05.492 --> 07:08.495
Jessie, you're making
too big a deal
out of these SATs.

07:08.528 --> 07:10.830
Colleges look
at other things too--

07:10.864 --> 07:12.232
Your grades,
your activities.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.900
And no one can
touch you there.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.869
- Maybe you're right.
- Of course, we're right.

07:15.902 --> 07:18.271
Yeah, why should I worry
about my score?

07:18.304 --> 07:20.040
I did better
than the two of you!

07:21.808 --> 07:26.046
Not that much better,
considering you're
both cheerleaders.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.448
I mean,
cheerleaders are bright.
You have to...

07:28.481 --> 07:30.283
Jump and yell
at the same time.

07:30.316 --> 07:31.818
And if you
don't get out of here,

07:31.851 --> 07:34.187
I'll jump and yell all over
your neurotic nose!

07:36.556 --> 07:38.825
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, Zack.

07:38.858 --> 07:42.395
- Are you
interested in Stansbury?
- Well, I am now.

07:42.429 --> 07:45.899
I'm trying to get
my grade point up
so they'll consider me.

07:45.932 --> 07:47.967
Do you think we could
study together sometime?

07:48.068 --> 07:50.804
I just know I'd learn
so much from you.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.473
Study dates are
my specialty, Heather.

07:53.506 --> 07:55.975
We can have one tomorrow night
if you'd like.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.278
I'd love it.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.846
There he is.

07:59.879 --> 08:02.749
Mr. SAT!

08:05.418 --> 08:08.755
Congratulations, Zack.
Highest score in the school.

08:08.788 --> 08:12.192
I guess all that advice
I've been giving
you finally paid off.

08:12.225 --> 08:14.861
Yeah, that must be it, sir.

08:14.894 --> 08:17.330
Come on, Zack.
Excuse us.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.132
Excuse me, Mrs. Billingham?

08:19.165 --> 08:22.202
I would like to personally
introduce Zack Morris.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.937
- Hi.
- ( Mrs. Billingham chuckles )

08:24.037 --> 08:28.375
Zack just racked up
1500 on his SAT.

08:28.408 --> 08:30.443
Sir, please,
don't embarrass me.

08:30.477 --> 08:32.879
Well, that is quite a score,
young man.

08:32.912 --> 08:34.914
You sound like
Stansbury material.

08:37.116 --> 08:40.520
And let me also
put in a good word
for Jessica Spano here.

08:40.553 --> 08:42.522
She's president
of the student council,

08:42.554 --> 08:45.058
a straight-A student--
quite a girl.

08:45.058 --> 08:49.062
- Thank you, Mr. Belding.
- I'll let you get
back to business.

08:49.095 --> 08:52.332
Well, Jessie, you sound
like Stansbury
material as well.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.968
Tell me,
what was your SAT score?

08:55.068 --> 08:57.170
Well, not quite
as high as Zack's--

08:57.203 --> 09:00.106
That's all right.
What number exactly?

09:00.140 --> 09:02.275
- 1205.
- Oh.

09:02.308 --> 09:04.244
I see.

09:04.277 --> 09:08.114
You know, there are
a lot of other schools
that are perfectly adequate.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.416
Why don't you go
talk with them?

09:10.316 --> 09:12.352
Now then, Zack,
sit down,

09:12.385 --> 09:15.522
and let me tell you
about all the advantages

09:15.555 --> 09:19.325
that Stansbury has to offer
someone as intelligent as you.

09:26.599 --> 09:29.636
I just could not
decide which college
I like best yesterday.

09:29.669 --> 09:32.339
I mean, The Westfield
rep was gorgeous,

09:32.372 --> 09:35.542
but the guy from UCLA
was more my type.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.544
I don't think I'm ready
to pick a college.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.513
When I graduate, I'll travel
and get my head straight.

09:40.547 --> 09:43.850
There are parts of Disneyland
I've never seen!

09:43.883 --> 09:47.554
You guys are obsessing over
nothing. We don't graduate
for another year.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.090
You're right.
But I still can't believe it.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.525
How could she pass over
a straight-A student

09:52.559 --> 09:54.094
for someone who's never
done homework?

09:54.127 --> 09:56.363
Come on, Jessie,
that's not true.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.431
Matter of fact,
I have a study date tonight.

09:58.465 --> 09:59.866
Study date?

09:59.899 --> 10:02.702
All you're going to learn is
the flavor of
Heather's lip gloss.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.704
Yeah.
Isn't it great?

10:04.738 --> 10:07.374
Anyway,
Belding wanted to see me
before school started.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.376
Probably wants to give me
an award for my SATs.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.444
- Later, everyone.
- All: Bye.

10:14.514 --> 10:17.817
There's the Stansbury rep!

10:17.851 --> 10:20.720
I bet she looked over
your records and
changed her mind.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.522
There you are.
I've been looking for you!

10:22.555 --> 10:24.491
I don't mean to brag,
but I knew you'd
change your mind--

10:24.524 --> 10:26.960
- You're AC Slater,
aren't you?
- Me?

10:26.993 --> 10:29.829
- Him?
- Yeah, I'm AC Slater.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.731
Could we speak in private
for a moment?

10:31.765 --> 10:33.600
Sure.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.436
Did I mention I won
the French award
the past two years?

10:37.637 --> 10:39.773
What could she
want with Slater?

10:39.806 --> 10:42.676
- What is happening here?
- I bet I know.

10:42.709 --> 10:44.411
I saw on "Days of Our Lives"

10:44.444 --> 10:46.179
that older women
like younger men.

10:50.216 --> 10:51.885
Well, what did she want?

10:51.918 --> 10:54.688
- Uh,
she wanted to talk to me.
- We know that.

10:54.721 --> 10:56.723
What about? What about?
What about?

10:56.756 --> 10:59.893
Well,
Stansbury's football team
could use a little help,

10:59.926 --> 11:02.862
and she's heard about me.

11:02.896 --> 11:06.566
You mean, she wants you
to go to Stansbury?

11:06.599 --> 11:08.902
Yeah.
On a football scholarship.

11:08.935 --> 11:11.371
But you had 1050 SATs.

11:11.404 --> 11:14.741
I guess if you
can throw a football
60 yards, it doesn't matter.

11:14.774 --> 11:17.811
Football? Football?!
Is that what this is about?

11:17.844 --> 11:20.380
- Jessie, take it easy.
- Look, Mama,

11:20.413 --> 11:23.850
- just 'cause
Helen's recruiting me--
- Helen? Helen?!

11:23.883 --> 11:26.886
- She asked me
to call her Helen.
- That is it, I'm out of here.

11:26.920 --> 11:30.423
Jessie, wait.
It's not my fault.

11:30.457 --> 11:34.461
Boy, it's a good
thing I didn't tell her
they offered me a car!

11:35.762 --> 11:36.963
Zack...

11:36.996 --> 11:40.100
because of your outstanding
SAT score,

11:40.100 --> 11:41.835
I have something special
to give you.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.504
Yes, I thought that's why
you wanted to see me.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.941
See,
I realize now why your grades
have been so pathetic.

11:47.974 --> 11:50.110
We haven't challenged you.

11:50.110 --> 11:54.614
And that's why I've changed
your schedule, Zack.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.883
- "Advanced calculus"?
- Uh-huh.

11:56.916 --> 11:58.752
- "College-level Russian"?
- Oh yeah!

11:58.785 --> 12:01.488
Sir,
these are all nerd classes.

12:01.521 --> 12:04.057
This means I'll get six hours
of homework a night.

12:04.057 --> 12:07.761
Maybe for an ordinary mind,
but not for a genius like you!

12:07.794 --> 12:09.629
There's no need to thank me.

12:09.662 --> 12:12.098
I've told your new teachers
to bear down on you.

12:12.132 --> 12:15.068
Let's see what
that brain can do
when it's pushed to the limit.

12:17.604 --> 12:19.639
<i>( knock on door )</i>

12:26.479 --> 12:28.481
( coughs )

12:29.482 --> 12:32.619
- Hi there. Come on in.
- Thanks.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.421
Why is it so dark in here?

12:34.454 --> 12:36.990
Well, this is the best light
for studying.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.459
- Really? It seems dim to me.
- Well--

12:39.492 --> 12:41.728
But you're the one
with the 1500 SATs.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.596
- Yes.
- <i>( knock on door )</i>

12:43.630 --> 12:46.733
Who can that be?
Heather,
make yourself comfortable.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.169
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

12:53.707 --> 12:55.675
- Zack, I have to talk to you.
- Kelly, not now.

12:55.709 --> 12:57.177
- I'm worried about Jessie.
- Is she alive?

12:57.210 --> 12:58.511
- Yes. No.
- Is she hurt?

12:58.545 --> 13:01.681
Then I'll call you later.
See ya.

13:01.715 --> 13:04.684
- Who was it?
- A very
aggressive girl scout.

13:04.718 --> 13:06.720
We'll be getting
peanut butter cookies
in about a month.

13:06.753 --> 13:10.590
- Now, let's get back to work.
- Maybe we can
start with algebra.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.560
No, Heather, Heather.
First things first.

13:13.593 --> 13:17.630
Your body has to be relaxed
so it can fully
absorb the information.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.399
- Let me massage your back.
- But--

13:19.432 --> 13:21.668
1500...

13:21.701 --> 13:23.837
Okay.

13:23.870 --> 13:27.507
- <i>( knock on door )</i>
- Now what?

13:27.540 --> 13:29.075
Excuse me.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.879
- Who are you?
- Hi, Heather!

13:32.912 --> 13:35.615
- Heather: <i>Bob, come on in.</i>
- Bob?

13:35.648 --> 13:38.718
Zack, Bob's my boyfriend.
He could use
some study help too.

13:38.752 --> 13:41.654
- I knew you wouldn't mind.
- ( fake laughter )

13:43.923 --> 13:46.993
This is a catastrophe.
The SATs are ruining my life.

13:47.093 --> 13:48.795
She only wants me for my mind.

13:53.533 --> 13:54.868
Hey, Zack, how did it go
with Heather?

13:54.901 --> 13:58.872
Didn't work out.
But Bob thinks I'm brilliant.

13:58.905 --> 14:01.408
Zack, I'm glad you're here.
We have to do
something about Jessie.

14:01.441 --> 14:04.944
She's flipped out 'cause
Stansbury wants you
and Slater, and not her.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.814
She got sent to detention
for the first
time in her life.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.617
- Yeah?
- She wrote 500
times on the blackboard,

14:10.650 --> 14:14.354
- "Death to the SATs.
- That is flipped out.

14:14.387 --> 14:17.757
Stansbury's making a
big mistake. Most school
would die to have Jessie.

14:17.791 --> 14:20.894
I hope we can find one quick
before she gets expelled.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.965
James, why are you
wearing a dress?

14:26.066 --> 14:29.602
It's a toga. I just came from
an audition of
"Julius Caesar."

14:29.636 --> 14:31.638
- Did you get the part?
- Almost.

14:31.671 --> 14:34.074
It was going well until
Mark Anthony called out,

14:34.107 --> 14:38.778
"Caesar," and I replied,
"With or without anchovies?"

14:38.812 --> 14:41.448
Listen,
I'm starting to get an idea.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.116
James, James...

14:43.149 --> 14:45.418
you're about to play
your greatest role ever.

14:53.259 --> 14:56.329
Jessie, what are
all these
letters of resignation?

14:56.363 --> 14:58.765
"Honor Society,"
"Student Council,"

14:58.798 --> 15:01.167
the yearbook,
the radio station--

15:01.201 --> 15:04.337
you even turned in
your hall pass. Why?

15:04.371 --> 15:07.640
- Because it's all worthless.
- How can you say that?

15:07.674 --> 15:11.511
It's easy. I open my mouth,
move my lips,
and the words just come out.

15:11.544 --> 15:14.481
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm late for
another pointless class.

15:16.049 --> 15:19.085
- Jessie, look, I want to--
- Look, I don't want to talk.

15:19.119 --> 15:25.425
Why don't you leave for
Stansbury and get an early
start on your scholarship?

15:25.458 --> 15:27.660
Okay,
Jessie's outside with Slater.
She didn't see us.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.596
- All set, James?
- Fully prepared.

15:29.629 --> 15:32.132
My performance will go down
in Bayview history.

15:32.165 --> 15:34.701
- That's Bayside.
- There too.

15:43.843 --> 15:47.080
Harvard?
I didn't know you were here.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.182
We weren't, until now.

15:49.215 --> 15:52.519
I'm Helen Billingham,
from Stansbury University.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.387
Ah, Stansbury.
( snorts )

15:54.421 --> 15:57.557
Agricultural school, correct?
Hog breeding,
that sort of thing?

15:57.590 --> 15:59.526
Oh no, no. Not at all.

15:59.559 --> 16:03.296
As a matter of fact,
we think of ourselves
as the Harvard of the West.

16:03.329 --> 16:06.066
Madam, North, South,
East or West,
there's only one...

16:07.233 --> 16:10.737
- Harvard!
- Of course.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.673
Hi, I'm interested in some
information about Harvard.

16:13.707 --> 16:18.178
Oh yes, of course.
Are you by any
chance Jessica Spano?

16:18.211 --> 16:21.114
- No--
- Then be gone! Shoo!

16:21.147 --> 16:23.450
Did you say Jessica Spano?

16:23.483 --> 16:26.419
Yes, I did, but not to you,
Mrs. Porkbellyham.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.224
Zack, how nice
to see you again.

16:31.257 --> 16:33.660
Actually, I wanted to talk
with the representative
from Harvard.

16:33.693 --> 16:37.664
No use wasting your time,
young man. We're only here
to see one person.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.300
But sir, I had over 1500
on my SATs.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.502
( laughs )
A single test,

16:42.535 --> 16:44.371
one lucky morning.

16:44.404 --> 16:48.074
Do you think Harvard is
impressed with that slice
of academic baloney?

16:48.074 --> 16:50.410
No! We're looking
for a straight-A student,

16:50.443 --> 16:53.179
the student council president,
the yearbook editor,

16:53.213 --> 16:55.548
and here at
Baydock-- view-- side!--

16:55.582 --> 16:58.385
you have that student
all rolled into one:

16:58.418 --> 17:02.422
Jessica Spano,
the find of the century.

17:05.492 --> 17:08.161
...furthermore, only a
corrupt system would
allow a meathead like you

17:08.194 --> 17:11.431
go to Stansbury while a
true intellect like
me gets turned away.

17:11.464 --> 17:14.501
Jessie, you know what?
You are right.
This system stinks!

17:14.534 --> 17:17.237
This meathead is going
to go into that gym,
and tell Helen

17:17.270 --> 17:22.041
that if Stansbury won't take
you, she can take my
scholarship and stuff it!

17:22.075 --> 17:25.045
Slater,
wait, it won't help anything
if you ruin your future too!

17:25.045 --> 17:29.315
Young man, you're not
fit to shine Jessica
Spano's shoes!

17:29.349 --> 17:33.153
Why don't you go over to
Mrs.
Billygoatcheese Hamsandwich's

17:33.186 --> 17:35.055
excuse for a university?

17:35.088 --> 17:38.458
We don't want you
at Harvard!

17:38.491 --> 17:41.061
You're very--
As a matter of fact, we--

17:41.094 --> 17:43.096
- Can I go?
- Yes!

17:43.129 --> 17:47.734
Your presence is
an insult at Harvard!

17:47.767 --> 17:50.103
- I-- l--
- Would you hurry up?

17:50.136 --> 17:51.604
We don't want
Jessie to see you!

17:51.638 --> 17:52.706
Don't do
anything you'll regret!

17:55.775 --> 17:58.378
- So sorry.
- Excuse me.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.381
- James, is that you?
- No, Jessie, it's not--

18:01.414 --> 18:03.283
- Excuse me.
- Hi, Jessie.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.218
- Bye, Jessie.
- What is this all about?

18:05.251 --> 18:07.520
Come on, Mama, watch me
tell her off over here.

18:07.554 --> 18:10.090
Excuse me, Helen.
Hi. Listen up, Helen.

18:10.123 --> 18:12.692
- If you don't take Jessie--
- Not take Jessie?

18:12.726 --> 18:16.496
Don't be silly!
She's our number-one choice.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.598
- I am?
- Please excuse the way

18:18.631 --> 18:22.035
I treated you earlier.
I hope you'll
come to Stansbury.

18:22.068 --> 18:25.338
And you just tell Harvard
they've come
a long way for nothing!

18:25.372 --> 18:27.040
Harvard?
They aren't even here.

18:27.073 --> 18:28.408
Oh yes, they are.
And they want you.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.444
But why travel 3,000 miles
when you can get
a better education--

18:31.478 --> 18:35.348
Excuse me. Did Harvard
have a mustache and a pipe?

18:36.116 --> 18:37.617
Why, yes.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.288
( all whistle )

18:43.823 --> 18:46.426
Mrs. Billingham,
is the only reason
you want me now

18:46.459 --> 18:48.395
because Harvard
wants me too?

18:48.428 --> 18:50.764
They are
the Stansbury of the East.

18:51.765 --> 18:53.767
( sighs )
You know what?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.368
Thanks, but no thanks.

18:55.402 --> 18:57.237
If Stansbury is
that hypocritical,

18:57.270 --> 19:00.173
they'll have to do
without Jessica Spano.

19:01.274 --> 19:04.177
And without AC Slater.

19:04.210 --> 19:06.680
And it's Stansbury's loss.

19:06.713 --> 19:09.349
Do you have any brochures
I could look at?

19:12.185 --> 19:14.254
"Chairman of the SAT board"?

19:14.287 --> 19:18.425
Yes, Stanley Alan Taylor, SAT.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.762
I've come here to talk to you
about Zachary Morris.

19:22.796 --> 19:26.032
We at the testing board
are worried sick about him.

19:26.032 --> 19:27.434
Worried? Why?

19:27.467 --> 19:30.770
You don't know,
you poor fool, do you?

19:30.804 --> 19:34.040
We at the testing board
have discovered
that those students

19:34.040 --> 19:36.543
who score over 1501
on our test

19:36.576 --> 19:40.246
are performing
terribly in college.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.614
- They are?
- Yes.

19:41.648 --> 19:44.551
Because unenlightened
potty-headed principals

19:44.584 --> 19:48.054
are burning out
these bright minds
with extra work.

19:48.054 --> 19:52.092
Hopefully,
that's not
happening here, is it?

19:52.125 --> 19:55.528
See, I thought that you had
to challenge
a mind like Zack's.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.764
Precisely wrong!

19:57.797 --> 20:00.200
Only a misguided twit...

20:00.233 --> 20:03.603
would burden a brain like his
with extra studies.

20:03.636 --> 20:09.042
- What should I do?
- Give him no homework.

20:10.276 --> 20:13.246
Allow his mind to think...

20:13.279 --> 20:16.049
freely.

20:16.082 --> 20:18.585
That is, of course,
if you care.

20:19.586 --> 20:20.820
( sobbing )
I care.

20:20.854 --> 20:23.123
I care!

20:23.156 --> 20:26.526
Zack Morris, report
to the principal's office--

20:26.559 --> 20:29.763
Sir,
I just happened to be walking
by your office. What's up?

20:29.796 --> 20:32.132
Zack, this is Mr. Taylor,

20:32.165 --> 20:35.201
from the SAT board.

20:35.235 --> 20:38.505
We have decided
to put you back
in your old classes.

20:38.538 --> 20:42.175
But, sir, I was enjoying
all the extra
hours of homework

20:42.208 --> 20:44.310
and bonding with nerds.

20:44.344 --> 20:47.180
You see?!
We must move quickly.

20:47.213 --> 20:49.849
I suggest giving him
a day or two off,

20:49.883 --> 20:52.719
to clear his cluttered mind.
It's essential!

20:52.752 --> 20:54.554
- He's got it!
- No, sir.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.793
No, sir.
I love school.

20:59.826 --> 21:02.295
No, you need time off, Zack.

21:02.328 --> 21:04.731
- Only if you insist.
- I insist!

21:04.764 --> 21:07.534
- Someday you'll
thank me, Zack.
- Okay.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.669
I know you have
my best interest at heart.

21:14.808 --> 21:16.643
Thanks for that
stunt with James.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.079
We were trying to get you
back into Stansbury.

21:19.079 --> 21:21.514
Yeah, I know.
But l don't need
Stansbury anymore.

21:21.548 --> 21:23.683
There are hundreds
of other good colleges.

21:23.717 --> 21:27.253
- I'm sure I'll
get into one of them.
- I'm sure you will too.

21:27.287 --> 21:29.389
I made too much
out of those SATs.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.491
I got a 1200,
you got a 1500.

21:31.524 --> 21:34.694
- It doesn't
really matter, does it?
- Not one bit.

21:36.162 --> 21:38.398
- But, Jessie,
there's just one thing.
- What's that?

21:38.431 --> 21:40.533
I got a 1502.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.102
Here you go.

21:42.102 --> 21:44.270
