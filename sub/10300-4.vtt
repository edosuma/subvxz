01:16.640 --> 01:19.712
All right, contestants, we polled
100 derelicts and ask ed them. ;

01:19.920 --> 01:22.070
"If the government
actually made you work...

01:22.280 --> 01:24.396
...what job
would you least lik e to have?"

01:24.600 --> 01:27.637
- Shoe salesman?
- Number one answer!

01:29.880 --> 01:33.953
And I might add,
the answer given by all 100 people.

01:35.320 --> 01:38.517
Yeah, certainly "game-show host"
must have got one vote.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.272
Dad, you got a minute?

01:47.480 --> 01:49.675
For you, Bud? No.

01:51.400 --> 01:54.551
I'm not Bud. Now, how many times
do I have to tell you?

01:54.760 --> 01:58.912
When the hat is on,
I'm street rapper "Grand Master B."

01:59.840 --> 02:01.876
When it's off, I'm Bud.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.116
Got it? Now...

02:04.360 --> 02:07.830
...the hat is on. Who am I?

02:08.960 --> 02:11.599
Mommy's second little joke on me?

02:13.480 --> 02:16.119
The Grand Master is not amused.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.550
Now, listen, Dad,
I need 20 bucks for a pizza.

02:18.760 --> 02:20.512
I need you to leave it on the table...

02:20.720 --> 02:23.712
...so I can pretend to steal it
in front of the girl.

02:26.040 --> 02:29.191
Because, after all, I am an outlaw.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.914
Well, I'm sorry, Grasshopper.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.798
That's Grand Master, you fool.

02:37.040 --> 02:41.238
Gas-passer, Bass-haster,
what's the difference?

02:41.600 --> 02:42.999
All right, look...

02:43.200 --> 02:47.512
...I'm gonna have to communicate
with you in the language of the street.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.075
Yo, I'm broke.

03:05.640 --> 03:08.871
Now put your little hat on sideways
and boo-boo away.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.392
The Grand Master will not forget this.

03:17.360 --> 03:20.272
One day these kids are gonna learn
the value of a dollar.

03:25.200 --> 03:28.397
Daddy, can I have $1000?

03:28.600 --> 03:32.752
Well, sure, pumpkin. Get it from Bud,
I just gave him a million.

03:34.320 --> 03:38.757
Yep, that's the story of my life,
a dollar short and a week late.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.273
Oh, please, Daddy.

03:43.480 --> 03:46.597
It's for something really important.
I need a gown.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.633
Now, as you know, I am a model.

03:49.840 --> 03:54.231
And for the past few months, I've been
proudly reigning as Miss Weenie Tot.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.554
But I've decided
that it's time to move up...

03:57.760 --> 04:03.357
...so I am going for the coveted title
of Miss Cheese.

04:05.160 --> 04:07.515
How proud can a father be?

04:08.320 --> 04:10.470
Miss Cheese is no joke, Daddy.

04:10.680 --> 04:13.319
I could lord it over
all those other snotty cheeses.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.590
Miss Swiss, Miss Gouda...

04:15.800 --> 04:18.360
...and that haughty
Miss Individually-Wrapped American...

04:18.560 --> 04:20.949
...who thinks her cheese
doesn't stink.

04:22.040 --> 04:24.110
Oh, please, Daddy, it's only $1000.

04:24.320 --> 04:28.029
Well, pumpkin, why can't you wear one
of your gowns from Miss Weenie Tot?

04:28.240 --> 04:31.869
Because they all smell like pork
and old men's hands.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.438
I'm sorry, honey, but as you know,
your mother's pregnant.

04:36.640 --> 04:40.315
We have to put our money aside for
the things that pregnant women need.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.596
- Where is Mom?
- She's at the beauty parlour...

04:42.800 --> 04:45.268
...having her stomach
wrapped in mud.

04:54.200 --> 04:58.159
Who wants to be the first to see
their reflection in my shiny belly?

04:59.080 --> 05:01.833
Mom, Dad won't give me
$1000 for a gown.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.991
Al, is this true?

05:06.640 --> 05:09.996
Well, I'm sorry, Peg.
I saw some underwear I had to have.

05:11.840 --> 05:14.877
It's not true, Mom,
he just gave Bud a million.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.795
Be gone, cement booties.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.636
Fine. Then I shall get it on my own.

05:21.840 --> 05:26.152
And I shall be cheese queen,
this I vow.

05:27.440 --> 05:30.477
Honey, I agree with you
about not giving the kids money.

05:30.680 --> 05:32.079
I didn't want to say anything.

05:32.280 --> 05:35.317
There's no sense in them
hating both of us.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.799
Anyway, I need money.
I have to go to the doctor.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.558
For what?

05:40.800 --> 05:43.439
I'm pregnant, you Zagnut.

05:44.080 --> 05:48.835
- And I want you to come with me.
- Why? I never came with you before.

05:55.720 --> 06:00.350
Now, don't get me started on that.
I'm talking about the doctor.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.069
I don't want to be the only woman
there alone.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.238
People stare at me
and I wonder what they're thinking.

06:06.440 --> 06:09.796
If you're with me,
at least I know what they're thinking:

06:10.560 --> 06:13.632
"Why didn't that poor woman
come alone?"

06:14.760 --> 06:16.955
Peg, you can sweet-talk me
all you want...

06:17.160 --> 06:20.755
...but I'm not sitting among
a bunch of foetus condos in overalls.

06:22.040 --> 06:24.918
All right, I'll just have to think
of someone other than you...

06:25.120 --> 06:26.599
...to be the father of my baby.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.712
Well, why didn't you think of that
five months ago?

06:31.240 --> 06:34.550
Honey, I was worried that if the baby
showed any signs of promise...

06:34.760 --> 06:37.149
...you'd get suspicious.

06:40.640 --> 06:42.232
Now, come on, help me think.

06:42.440 --> 06:45.796
Who can I get to play the part
of the father of my baby?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.638
Mom...

06:48.320 --> 06:49.753
...I'm glad you're here.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.312
Who am I?

06:55.000 --> 06:57.468
- My husband.
- What?

07:02.080 --> 07:04.514
Stay tuned
for our after-school special...

07:04.720 --> 07:08.315
...I Drink Because My Dad's
a Shoe Salesman.

07:16.760 --> 07:18.637
Good one.

07:19.360 --> 07:20.873
Hi, Daddy.

07:22.560 --> 07:25.677
Listen,
I'm preparing for my beauty contest.

07:25.880 --> 07:29.077
So ask me to name
six types of cheese.

07:29.280 --> 07:32.272
Oh, okay. Name six types of cheese.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.112
Good, pumpkin.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.478
Sweetie...

07:41.680 --> 07:43.272
Honey, you know, I'm really sorry...

07:43.480 --> 07:45.755
...I couldn't buy you
that thousand-dollar gown...

07:45.960 --> 07:47.279
...but as you know I'm...

07:47.480 --> 07:49.277
A failure, Daddy?

07:50.240 --> 07:51.832
I know. But it's okay.

07:52.040 --> 07:54.998
Because I got a night job,
earned $1000...

07:55.200 --> 07:57.794
...and I bought the gown myself.

08:03.040 --> 08:04.758
Now wait a second.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.800
My pretty teenage daughter...

08:08.000 --> 08:10.594
...with the brain of a fruit fly...

08:11.720 --> 08:14.439
...earned $1000 in three nights.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.676
Should I be worried?

08:19.960 --> 08:22.713
Okay, we're ready to go to the doctor.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.309
Come on, Bud,
show Daddy how nice you look.

08:39.440 --> 08:44.116
I know that face.
Why, it's Grandfather B.

08:47.080 --> 08:49.469
It's funny, I always thought
wingtips and a fedora...

08:49.680 --> 08:51.432
...would make me look cool.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.677
Imagine my surprise.

08:54.760 --> 08:57.832
Hey, where'd you get the fake,
greasy moustache?

08:58.240 --> 09:00.515
I shaved your back.

09:04.520 --> 09:06.192
Come on, let's go, sweetheart.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.595
Dad, please don't make me do this.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.155
Peg, I will not let you
do this to the boy.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.555
Mind your own business, Al.

09:13.760 --> 09:15.478
So long, son.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.759
Hi, Al.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.399
Hi, Al.

09:27.600 --> 09:31.479
I snuck in because if anyone saw me
coming in here in broad daylight...

09:31.680 --> 09:33.511
...I'd just die.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.389
Anyway, I need some advice.

09:36.600 --> 09:39.672
Well, throw a wig on it
until it grows to a woman's length.

09:41.560 --> 09:44.393
Well, can't I just grow
one really long hair...

09:44.600 --> 09:47.672
...and wrap it around
my entire head like you?

09:48.760 --> 09:50.716
Come on, Al, I need some advice.

09:50.920 --> 09:54.515
Jefferson's been staying out
really late the last few nights...

09:54.720 --> 09:58.110
...and coming home smelling
like cigarettes and exotic beers.

09:58.320 --> 09:59.958
Where is he, Al?
Where does he go?

10:00.160 --> 10:04.358
Probably, if he's coming home to you,
a bar with really ugly women.

10:08.080 --> 10:11.709
Well, I know he has a wandering eye.

10:11.920 --> 10:14.229
I've seen him
watching the Madonna videos...

10:14.440 --> 10:18.479
...and I can tell he just wants to
put on a pointy bra and vogue.

10:19.880 --> 10:22.792
But I can't understand
why he has to leave for a good time...

10:23.000 --> 10:24.558
...just because I'm pregnant.

10:24.760 --> 10:29.276
I mean, there are a lot of men
who still find me quite attractive.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.198
Well, they do.

10:36.160 --> 10:39.470
Especially now that I have
the big bazooms.

10:41.120 --> 10:45.113
Yeah, I only pray one of those
monsters doesn't fall on the baby.

10:48.680 --> 10:51.478
Oh, God, I'm losing my husband.

10:51.680 --> 10:54.240
Well, probably.

10:56.800 --> 10:59.997
Since you're a single mother now,
you have a lot of time on your hands.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.430
I tell you what,
why don't you help me. Listen...

11:02.640 --> 11:06.076
...how could a pretty, teenage,
not-so-bright girl...

11:06.280 --> 11:08.999
...earn $1000 in three nights?

11:09.200 --> 11:11.077
Well, let's see.

11:11.280 --> 11:14.352
Either as an opening act
for MC Hammer...

11:14.560 --> 11:17.028
...or perhaps by spanking
elderly gentlemen...

11:17.240 --> 11:20.118
...in a tight black leather outfit.
- Hey, now.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.348
Now, I know my little girl.

11:22.560 --> 11:26.109
If she was doing something immoral,
a father would know about it.

11:30.480 --> 11:34.359
Daddy, I'm going out now
and I'll be home by dawn. Okay?

11:34.560 --> 11:36.471
Goodbye, pumpkin.

11:36.720 --> 11:41.271
You see, a father has a sixth sense
about these things.

11:41.480 --> 11:44.552
Sort of a second eye, if you will.

11:48.480 --> 11:49.708
Hello.

11:49.920 --> 11:51.876
No, Kelly's out.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.071
Yeah, I'll take a message.

11:55.520 --> 11:57.670
You have the money...

11:57.880 --> 12:02.351
...and you can't wait to see
if she's as good as the guys say she is.

12:07.240 --> 12:10.038
And you'll meet her where?

12:10.720 --> 12:13.280
Well, perhaps I'll see you there.

12:17.160 --> 12:18.752
Don't do anything hasty, Al.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.439
I'm calm. I'm calm.

12:20.640 --> 12:23.029
I'm sure there's a rational explanation
behind this...

12:23.240 --> 12:27.233
...and I'll get to the bottom of it
calmly and rationally.

12:48.120 --> 12:52.079
Do you believe what that girl
can do with her hands?

12:52.280 --> 12:53.918
You gonna try her next?

12:54.120 --> 12:57.590
Not me. I'm happy just watching.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.833
Nice game, chump.

13:14.040 --> 13:17.430
Well, I guess my daughter
didn't really need braces.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.878
All right, who's the next victim?

13:23.360 --> 13:25.954
Well, looks like no takers, Kelly.

13:26.160 --> 13:29.516
Might as well take a break
until your next match gets here.

13:30.320 --> 13:33.710
Hey, thanks for backing me for only
80 percent of the profit, Mr. Darcy.

13:34.760 --> 13:37.354
Hey, if I as an adult
can't help out our young people...

13:37.560 --> 13:40.279
...then am I not
a part of the problem?

13:41.520 --> 13:44.956
Hey, mister,
you wanna buy a car stereo?

13:45.160 --> 13:47.879
Find me a Blaupunkt and we'll talk.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.593
You gotta give something back.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.350
Well, if you need me,
I'll be over there...

13:53.560 --> 13:55.915
...recalibrating the angles
for my bank shots.

13:56.120 --> 13:59.112
You know, cushions are a little bit
dead to the sides.

13:59.320 --> 14:02.073
- Actually, I have to go wee-wee.
- Okay.

14:02.800 --> 14:06.429
I'll bet there's no one dumb enough
to get suckered in by her now.

14:06.640 --> 14:10.349
I don't know, that guy who just
walked in looks awful stupid.

14:15.240 --> 14:17.356
Where's my pumpkin?

14:17.960 --> 14:21.555
Hey, you guys. Have you seen
a cute little blond-haired girl?

14:21.760 --> 14:23.955
Yeah. She just finished off some guy.

14:24.160 --> 14:26.833
If you want a piece of her action,
go see her manager.

14:28.920 --> 14:31.070
That guy over there.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.197
Oh, hi, Al. Man, you should see
your daughter hustle...

14:41.680 --> 14:44.319
Say goodnight, Superfly.

14:44.560 --> 14:45.959
Hi, Daddy. What's new?

14:46.160 --> 14:48.196
Stand back, pumpkin.
He's just about to pop...

14:48.400 --> 14:51.233
...and I don't want teeth and eyes
all over you.

14:51.880 --> 14:53.871
But Daddy, it's not Mr. Darcy's fault.

14:54.080 --> 14:56.514
It was my idea to hustle pool.

14:56.720 --> 14:59.188
Why didn't you tell me
that's what you were doing?

14:59.400 --> 15:01.994
You said you didn't like me
hanging out in these places.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.509
Well, sweetheart,
you were only 5 then.

15:06.480 --> 15:09.119
Well, Jefferson,
looks like I owe you an apology.

15:09.320 --> 15:11.550
Here, let me help you up.

15:11.760 --> 15:15.150
There now. Here. All right.

15:15.360 --> 15:18.432
No harm, no foul. Friends, huh?

15:21.960 --> 15:25.350
Honey, this place is a little unsavoury
for you. What say we go in a bar...

15:25.560 --> 15:28.632
...and we get Dad a beer and girlie
magazine and straight home.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.195
Well, I have another match coming.

15:31.400 --> 15:34.198
- Daddy, I can't lose.
- Honey, it matters not.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.198
When it comes to my girl there are
some things more important.

15:37.400 --> 15:42.428
I've got $10,000 that says
I can beat any girl in the house.

15:45.720 --> 15:48.598
I think we can handle that...

15:51.560 --> 15:53.551
What's that you say, Jefferson?

15:53.760 --> 15:55.876
I should handle it? You're covered.

15:57.360 --> 16:01.035
I'm Slick Stick Jackson.
Who are you?

16:01.240 --> 16:04.277
Who am I? Why, I'm Al...

16:05.120 --> 16:07.509
What's a cool nickname for me?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.116
I'm Al "Daddy" Bundy.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.556
Where's your money, Daddy?

16:15.760 --> 16:17.591
What are you, my wife?

16:18.080 --> 16:21.356
I'll get that money
if I have to dance naked in the street.

16:22.520 --> 16:23.919
Daddy.

16:24.240 --> 16:27.152
- Sailors are the best tippers.
- Thank you.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.153
Hey, blondie...

16:36.400 --> 16:38.311
...and "Action Jackson" over there...

16:40.720 --> 16:44.156
...where's Daddy?
- Strip-search me.

16:57.560 --> 17:00.438
Let's shoot pool, fat man.

17:00.920 --> 17:05.198
Hey, Al, can I get you a chair
or a coffin or something?

17:05.400 --> 17:06.833
Daddy, you look so pale.

17:07.040 --> 17:09.076
That's because I've been
all over town...

17:09.280 --> 17:12.589
...selling pints of blood
to nine blood banks.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.711
Al, the human body
only holds eight pints.

17:14.920 --> 17:16.319
Well, that's what they say.

17:16.520 --> 17:19.079
But the brain hides some.

17:20.960 --> 17:23.792
So you see, Mr. Koppel,
I'm a living example...

17:24.000 --> 17:27.117
...of how the brain
really doesn't need blood to work.

17:27.319 --> 17:29.880
Oh, the pretty colours.

17:30.760 --> 17:32.990
So I'll take that 150
and bet it against...

17:33.200 --> 17:36.749
Hey, everything looks like noodles
in here!

17:38.480 --> 17:39.913
Don't worry, Daddy.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.998
As God is my witness,
you will have blood again.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.395
Thank you, Jefferson.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.397
Seven ball.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.599
Double kiss.

18:39.160 --> 18:42.311
Oh, did I win again?

18:44.880 --> 18:46.757
Good girl, pumpkin.

18:48.520 --> 18:52.195
Hey, umpire,
he's got a horse in his pocket.

18:52.400 --> 18:53.753
Now, I need a ruling.

19:10.040 --> 19:13.476
Well, you seem
to be doing a lot better, Al.

19:15.440 --> 19:18.989
You stopped air-guitaring
"It's A Small World."

19:20.280 --> 19:22.430
Must be the beer.

19:22.680 --> 19:25.911
The brain doesn't need blood,
just gotta keep the brain wet.

19:27.440 --> 19:28.668
What's going on?

19:28.880 --> 19:32.793
Well, you were up five grand
and we could have quit, but you said:

19:33.000 --> 19:36.356
"Damn a unified Germany. Play on."

19:36.560 --> 19:42.669
So now if Kelly makes this shot,
you win $10,000.

19:42.880 --> 19:46.555
Well, seem like I do what I was
knowing then, hey, white boy?

19:49.160 --> 19:51.799
Now I gotta give my pumpkin
a little pep talk.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.513
Al...

19:56.720 --> 19:57.994
Pumpkin?

20:06.160 --> 20:07.878
What, Daddy?

20:09.960 --> 20:12.758
Well, I was saying,
I'm proud of you, pumpkin.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.188
You're succeeding.

20:14.400 --> 20:18.279
I tried to succeed,
but failure was in my blood.

20:18.720 --> 20:21.837
Guess I don't have to worry
about that anymore, huh?

20:24.480 --> 20:27.472
What I'm trying to say
is that the fate...

20:27.680 --> 20:29.432
...of not only King Charles...

20:29.640 --> 20:33.553
...but the entire Restoration,
lies on this shot.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.873
This tape will self-destruct
in five seconds.

21:31.320 --> 21:33.356
As I was saying, pumpkin...

21:33.560 --> 21:35.835
...it's very important
that you make this shot.

21:36.040 --> 21:38.110
It's very, very important.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.598
I made the shot, Daddy.

21:42.840 --> 21:44.398
Yes!

21:46.560 --> 21:50.394
We're rich. We've got $10,000.
Where's the money?

21:50.680 --> 21:53.672
Well, a goat ate it, Dad.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.549
A pink one?
Head like George Washington?

21:58.760 --> 22:00.079
Yep, that's the one.

22:00.880 --> 22:02.632
I know that goat.

22:02.840 --> 22:05.149
I didn't trust him
when he took my beer.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.476
I know where he lives.
Come on, pumpkin.

22:07.680 --> 22:10.638
Come on. I'll hold him down,
you take his wallet.
