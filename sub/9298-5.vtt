Manny "Mega" Vega's moon shot</i>

<i>What a game last night.</i>

01:09.268 --> 01:12.103
<i>The Pilgrims are on a streak
with "Mega" Vega.</i>

01:12.137 --> 01:13.738
Chimpanzees do that.
Do what?

01:13.772 --> 01:16.040
Grab their crotches.
It's a sign of aggression.

01:16.075 --> 01:17.942
<i>Welcome back
to "Baseball Live."</i>

01:17.977 --> 01:19.944
<i>How exciting is this?</i>

01:19.979 --> 01:22.613
<i>Two Boston teams
competing for playoff berths.</i>

01:22.648 --> 01:26.484
<i>But what the Red Sox don't have
is Manny "Mega" Vega.</i>

01:26.518 --> 01:29.454
Man, that Mega Vega
sure can hit.

01:29.488 --> 01:33.460
"Mega" stands for "molecular
evolutionary genetics analysis."

01:33.580 --> 01:36.427
Oh, he is
quite the male specimen.

01:36.462 --> 01:40.331
<i>Mega focus. Mega power.</i>

01:40.366 --> 01:42.500
<i>Drink my Mega-Ade
to win every time.</i>

01:43.535 --> 01:45.036
I'd love to Mega him.

01:45.070 --> 01:47.772
Oh, hey. Language.
My mother's here.

01:47.806 --> 01:51.442
You should hear us when
you're not around policing us.

01:51.477 --> 01:52.510
He's a hunk.

01:52.544 --> 01:54.045
"Hunk"?

01:54.079 --> 01:55.413
Mmm.
Okay.

01:55.447 --> 01:57.582
Officially
throwing up in my mouth.

01:59.418 --> 02:01.886
No -- Jo Friday,
stop licking.

02:01.920 --> 02:03.921
Oh, don't yell at her.

02:03.956 --> 02:05.857
That's not yelling.

02:05.891 --> 02:07.091
Stop licking!

02:07.126 --> 02:08.292
That's yelling.

02:08.327 --> 02:09.994
<i>Speaking of a kiss goodbye.</i>

02:10.029 --> 02:11.963
<i>Co-owners no more.</i>

02:11.997 --> 02:16.067
<i>Phil Young announced today
that he controls the Pilgrims.</i>

02:16.101 --> 02:18.136
<i>Must be pretty upsetting
for the ex-wife, Geena.</i>

02:18.170 --> 02:19.170
That's too bad.

02:19.204 --> 02:20.304
Well, at least

02:20.339 --> 02:22.206
they're fighting
over a baseball team.

02:22.241 --> 02:24.342
<i>My parents are fighting
over the snow shovel.</i>

02:24.376 --> 02:26.310
<i>I doubt it will.</i>

02:31.016 --> 02:33.251
Oh, my God. Tommy.

02:35.087 --> 02:37.822
I forgot to tell you
he was coming home.

02:37.856 --> 02:39.457
You forgot to tell me?

02:39.491 --> 02:41.092
<i>Did you forget, too?</i>

02:42.194 --> 02:43.895
Janey.

02:43.929 --> 02:45.430
Hi.
Ooh.

02:45.464 --> 02:47.965
Thanks for your letters.
They really kept me going.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.901
I was looking for you
three months ago.

02:49.935 --> 02:51.769
Yeah. I got in a little fight
in the yard.

02:51.804 --> 02:53.271
They threw me back in, so...

02:53.305 --> 02:56.340
Yeah, well, let's not screw up
your early release, okay?

02:56.375 --> 02:58.276
Fresh start, yeah?
Yeah.

02:58.310 --> 03:01.412
Dr. Isles, I tightened up the
flush valve in the guest house.

03:01.447 --> 03:03.181
Thank you.
Please let me pay you.

03:03.215 --> 03:04.415
No, not a chance.

03:04.450 --> 03:07.952
I mean, it's the least
I can do, you know?

03:13.992 --> 03:17.862
- "All" you're doing for him?
- He's just visiting your mother.

03:17.896 --> 03:20.431
"Visiting" means
dropping by and then leaving.

03:20.466 --> 03:22.300
When's he leaving?

03:22.334 --> 03:24.302
Jane, he's gonna be
in violation of his probation

03:24.336 --> 03:25.770
without a permanent address.

03:25.804 --> 03:27.238
So the visit is permanent.

03:27.272 --> 03:28.906
Temporarily.

03:29.908 --> 03:32.143
The only thing that Tommy does
"temporarily"

03:32.177 --> 03:33.211
is stay out of trouble.

03:33.245 --> 03:34.779
Jane, I know you.

03:34.813 --> 03:36.748
You're conflicted,
you want to help him,

03:36.782 --> 03:38.750
but you're afraid
that anything you do

03:38.784 --> 03:40.785
will be interpreted
as a sign of approval.

03:40.819 --> 03:43.788
My little brother
is a screw-up, Maura,

03:43.822 --> 03:48.693
<i>a completely lovable
screw-up felon.</i>

03:54.399 --> 03:57.235
The recidivism rate
for non-violent offenders

03:57.269 --> 03:59.904
is higher than for violent.

03:59.938 --> 04:01.139
It's 46% to 39%.

04:01.173 --> 04:03.207
So I'm thinking
this isn't a good idea.

04:05.444 --> 04:07.078
I'm doing this for your mother.

04:07.112 --> 04:08.980
You know,
he's made some bad choices,

04:09.014 --> 04:10.915
but that doesn't make him
a bad person.

04:10.949 --> 04:14.318
Oh, yeah, right.
He did fix your flush valve.

04:16.721 --> 04:18.723
She's licking her paws.

04:20.159 --> 04:22.059
Yeah, they're real red.
I know. I know.

04:26.398 --> 04:29.200
This is Dr. Isles.

04:29.234 --> 04:31.969
Okay, if the division
detectives have signed off,

04:32.004 --> 04:34.205
I will authorize
removal of the body.

04:34.239 --> 04:35.807
Thank you.

04:37.309 --> 04:40.645
Fatal slip and fall
at the Pilgrims' locker room.

04:40.679 --> 04:42.346
That's weird
they're not reporting it.

04:42.381 --> 04:43.848
Mm.
Let's go.

04:43.882 --> 04:45.449
I've never been
to the Pilgrims' stadium,

04:45.484 --> 04:47.418
and their locker room
is closer than your couch.

04:47.452 --> 04:49.120
Come on.

04:49.154 --> 04:51.255
Well, I've always wanted to see
them without their uniforms.

04:51.290 --> 04:52.356
Maura!

04:52.391 --> 04:53.424
This is Dr. Isles again.

04:53.458 --> 04:54.792
Uh, hold the body at the scene.

04:54.827 --> 04:56.160
I'm coming in.
Thank you.

04:59.832 --> 05:02.366
Um, you know, if you want,
I can take your doto the vet.

05:02.401 --> 05:07.972
No, your only job is -- is just
stay out of trouble, okay?

05:08.006 --> 05:09.440
Bye, ma.

05:09.474 --> 05:11.375
Bye, baby.

05:21.954 --> 05:24.255
Body's in the shower,
Dr. Isles.

05:24.289 --> 05:26.057
It's nice to see you,
detective Merck.

05:26.091 --> 05:27.925
<i>Actually, it's chief Merck now.</i>

05:27.960 --> 05:29.760
Of course. Congratulations. Thank you.

05:29.795 --> 05:31.762
What brings you out, Rizzoli?

05:31.797 --> 05:33.931
Just tagging along.
Look at you.

05:33.966 --> 05:35.366
You retire, land the plum job,

05:35.400 --> 05:37.235
chief of security
for the Pilgrims.

05:37.269 --> 05:38.436
Yeah, it's a long way

05:38.470 --> 05:40.671
from working those late nights
in homicide.

05:40.706 --> 05:43.140
Hey, listen, while you're here,
we treat Boston's finest

05:43.175 --> 05:45.142
to a couple of tickets
on the first-base line.

05:45.177 --> 05:46.878
I've only sat in the nosebleeds

05:46.912 --> 05:48.379
on police-appreciation
day -- thanks.

05:48.413 --> 05:50.181
What's this look like to you?

05:50.215 --> 05:52.817
Uh, it's pretty sad. It's a
poor fella on our coaching staff.

05:52.851 --> 05:54.051
Slipped and fell
in the shower this morning.

05:54.086 --> 05:55.853
Team's pretty shook up
about it.

05:55.888 --> 05:58.322
- Oh, the coaching staff? That's awful.
- Yeah. Hey, listen.

05:58.357 --> 05:59.857
Why don't you go out
and enjoy the game?

05:59.892 --> 06:01.259
I'll walk her through this,
and I'll have her out

06:01.293 --> 06:02.460
by the bottom of the first.

06:03.228 --> 06:04.896
Well, if it's okay with you,

06:04.930 --> 06:06.731
I'm gonna, uh, wait here
for Dr. Isles, all right?

06:06.765 --> 06:08.065
Uh, yeah, all right.
Sure.

06:08.100 --> 06:10.468
Let me, uh -- let me
go check on her, all right?

06:20.112 --> 06:22.213
Three, four, five,
six, seven...

06:22.247 --> 06:24.382
You got to be kidding.

06:25.717 --> 06:29.186
Oh, wow.
Manny "Mega" Vega in the flesh.

06:29.221 --> 06:33.124
Two, three, four, five,
six, seven...

06:48.206 --> 06:50.174
I guess we must look
pretty strange.

06:50.208 --> 06:52.510
Well, does he always puke
before a game?

06:52.544 --> 06:55.780
Yeah, yeah. Baseball players
are really superstitious.

06:55.814 --> 06:57.915
Part of his ritual.

06:58.450 --> 06:59.884
I'm Jesse Wade.

06:59.918 --> 07:00.851
Detective Jane Rizzoli.

07:00.886 --> 07:02.253
And I know who you are.

07:02.287 --> 07:04.021
Uh, rookie of the year
when you came into the bigs,

07:04.056 --> 07:05.022
two-time all-star.

07:05.057 --> 07:06.390
Impressive.

07:06.425 --> 07:10.027
Most women only know
the superstar, Mr. Mega Vega.

07:10.062 --> 07:12.029
Well, confession --
I'm a big Red Sox fan,

07:12.064 --> 07:14.865
- but, you know, maybe you guys can convert me.
- Yeah. Maybe.

07:14.900 --> 07:17.134
Man, you better move
and get out of my way.

07:17.169 --> 07:20.938
Man, you shouldn't even have a locker, the
way you're hitting. All right.

07:20.973 --> 07:22.206
Is that
part of his ritual, too?

07:22.240 --> 07:23.774
No.

07:23.809 --> 07:25.977
The...Dead guy in the shower's
got everybody spooked.

07:26.011 --> 07:27.578
Oh.

07:28.914 --> 07:30.047
Call me.

07:30.082 --> 07:32.183
Wouldn't mind
being interrogated by you.

07:32.217 --> 07:34.318
Heard that line,
like, four million times.

07:34.353 --> 07:36.754
You call me, and, uh,
I'll think of a new one.

07:36.788 --> 07:37.655
All right.

07:40.192 --> 07:42.126
- Feel good?
- Yeah.

07:44.296 --> 07:45.930
What's a coach doing
in the players' showers?

07:45.964 --> 07:47.264
Coaches, players, managers

07:47.299 --> 07:49.300
all have access to the gym
and the showers.

07:49.334 --> 07:50.801
What time did he come in?

07:50.836 --> 07:52.803
The records show
6:00 A.M.

07:54.940 --> 07:57.708
- What is it?
- I'm not sure.

07:57.743 --> 07:59.710
It's a slip and fall.
Can we just get him out of here?

07:59.745 --> 08:01.345
His body's already
in advanced rigor.

08:01.380 --> 08:03.647
That's very simple --
the hot water was running

08:03.682 --> 08:05.049
when the cleaning lady
found him.

08:05.083 --> 08:08.219
Hot water does accelerate it.

08:08.253 --> 08:10.755
It's this...

08:10.789 --> 08:13.257
Radiating
circular skull fracture

08:13.291 --> 08:15.059
consistent with a hard impact,

08:15.093 --> 08:18.829
and this -- a second compression
fracture to the occiput.

08:18.864 --> 08:21.065
Two skull fractures?
How? He fell once.

08:21.099 --> 08:24.468
Well, he slipped, cracked
his head on the shower handle,

08:24.503 --> 08:26.170
hit the floor.

08:26.204 --> 08:28.506
That's not what you're
thinking, is it?

08:36.048 --> 08:38.916
The gash is wider
than the shower handle.

08:38.950 --> 08:41.085
Something else
struck his skull.

08:41.119 --> 08:43.154
A weapon? Wh-- you got to use
your best guess.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.056
If there's any chance
this was a murder --

08:45.090 --> 08:48.025
murder?! Rizzoli, what the hell?
There's no murder here.

08:48.060 --> 08:52.196
Is it a suspicious death?
What does your gut say?

08:52.230 --> 08:54.665
- I don't listen to my intestines.
- Maura.

08:55.734 --> 08:58.102
I'm declaring the manner
of this death suspicious

08:58.136 --> 09:00.037
pending further
investigation --

09:00.072 --> 09:01.954
by the homicide unit.

09:02.074 --> 09:06.210
Take your V.I.P. Seats. Boston
homicide sits in the nosebleeds.

09:11.449 --> 09:12.615
What's going on?
I'm missing the game.

09:12.650 --> 09:14.983
- Yeah, so is he.
- Oh, boy.

09:15.103 --> 09:16.637
That guy got hit
by more than a pitch.

09:16.671 --> 09:18.472
- What's Dr. Isles say?
- Suspicious death.

09:18.506 --> 09:20.140
And their
million-dollar lawyers

09:20.175 --> 09:21.842
won't let us touch anything
until the warrant gets here.

09:21.876 --> 09:23.977
Victim's a member
of the coaching staff.

09:25.346 --> 09:26.647
Ron McKenna.

09:26.681 --> 09:28.549
I knew them all,
right down to the bat boys.

09:28.583 --> 09:29.750
Never heard of this guy.

09:29.784 --> 09:31.185
- Hey.
- Hey, you get it all?

09:31.219 --> 09:32.352
Judge polk
gave you the locker room,

09:32.387 --> 09:33.821
but he won't give you
the stadium.

09:33.855 --> 09:35.689
I'm not surprised.
He probably called the governor.

09:35.723 --> 09:37.157
He's not gonna cancel
this game.

09:37.192 --> 09:38.425
What about the, uh, dumpsters?

09:38.459 --> 09:39.426
- Judge said no.
- Fine.

09:39.460 --> 09:41.128
I'll type up another warrant

09:41.162 --> 09:43.597
and a find a judge who doesn't
have Pilgrims box seats.

09:43.631 --> 09:44.798
- Okay.
- Your retirement.

09:44.833 --> 09:46.867
Merck the jerk.

09:46.901 --> 09:48.869
All he ever talked about
was the Sox.

09:48.903 --> 09:52.773
When that job went to Celluci,
he sold his soul to get this one.

09:52.807 --> 09:56.143
He was in homicide 15 years.
You think he did clean-up?

09:56.177 --> 09:57.845
Let's find out.

10:01.916 --> 10:05.085
Here.
You know the drill.

10:06.254 --> 10:07.721
Uh, this is our house now.

10:07.755 --> 10:09.623
You can read that
on the way out.

10:09.657 --> 10:11.625
Okay, I want
all the dumpsters frozen.

10:11.659 --> 10:13.627
I want a man in front
of every one of them.

10:13.661 --> 10:15.262
Oh, come on --
I got to dumpster dive

10:15.296 --> 10:16.997
through 40,000 hot dogs
and blue shaved ice?

10:17.031 --> 10:18.632
Go before they empty it.

10:18.666 --> 10:20.734
If there's any evidence in
there, we don't want to lose it.

10:20.768 --> 10:23.103
Hey, hey. Did you get my text
about the Tommy surprise?

10:23.137 --> 10:25.105
- Yeah, why didn't ma tell us?
- Wh--

10:25.139 --> 10:26.673
At least she's not
trying to throw him

10:26.708 --> 10:28.308
another "welcome home" party.

10:28.343 --> 10:29.776
Yeah, because
he doesn't have one.

10:29.811 --> 10:33.280
Let's keep an eye on him,
all right?

10:33.314 --> 10:35.215
Well, as the team owner,
you and your lawyers

10:35.250 --> 10:36.416
must know
why we want to talk to you.

10:36.451 --> 10:38.151
Well, my head of security,
chief Merck,

10:38.186 --> 10:40.520
informs me that we've had
a tragic accident, officer.

10:40.555 --> 10:41.655
Detective.

10:41.689 --> 10:43.223
Tragic, yes.
Accident, we don't think so.

10:43.258 --> 10:45.025
So we will be conducting
a full investigation.

10:45.059 --> 10:47.828
That's very thorough of you to
dot your I's and cross your t's.

10:47.862 --> 10:49.563
See?

10:49.597 --> 10:50.731
I knew they weren't gonna
try to use our tragedy

10:50.765 --> 10:52.532
to make names for themselves.

10:52.567 --> 10:55.636
Ron McKenna's badge identifies
him as one of your coaches,

10:55.670 --> 10:57.838
but I didn't see his name
on your roster.

10:57.872 --> 11:00.607
Well, Mr. McKenna was a recent
addition to our coaching staff.

11:00.642 --> 11:02.542
Oh? What kind?

11:02.577 --> 11:05.646
Hitting coach?
Pitching? Base coach?

11:05.680 --> 11:08.382
- Special-assignment coach.
- What was his special assignment?

11:08.416 --> 11:10.150
I'm sorry, detective,

11:10.184 --> 11:12.419
but your warrant doesn't cover
this part of the house,

11:12.453 --> 11:13.787
nor does it give you the right

11:13.821 --> 11:15.656
to interrogate anyone
in this organization.

11:15.690 --> 11:17.591
I'm sorry.
I'd like to help.

11:17.625 --> 11:19.660
I represent
the entire organization.

11:19.694 --> 11:22.296
You will not speak with anyone
other than me.

11:22.330 --> 11:24.698
What is she doing here?

11:24.732 --> 11:26.800
Y-you better get down there
and tell Geena

11:26.834 --> 11:29.569
she's about to be in violation
of her restraining order.

11:29.604 --> 11:32.239
Well, since
you don't represent Geena,

11:32.273 --> 11:35.542
<i>I guess there is someone
to talk to, huh, Walt?</i>

11:38.379 --> 11:39.713
Sports guys are saying

11:39.747 --> 11:41.715
Phil took Geena's share
of the team, locked her out.

11:41.749 --> 11:44.151
Well, he looks like
someone who'd put up a fight.

11:44.185 --> 11:45.852
I wonder how he managed it.

11:45.887 --> 11:48.588
I have every right to be
in that stadium. That is my team.

11:48.623 --> 11:50.691
Get all these guys
out of here, all right?

11:50.725 --> 11:53.327
Mrs. young, Boston homicide.
Can we talk to you, please?

11:53.361 --> 11:55.062
Homicide?

11:56.597 --> 11:59.099
So It's true about Ron.

11:59.133 --> 12:01.101
That bastard won't let me in.

12:01.135 --> 12:03.103
You knew Ron McKenna?

12:03.137 --> 12:05.238
Of course.
I insisted we hire him.

12:05.273 --> 12:07.507
Let me guess --
Phil is stonewalling.

12:07.542 --> 12:09.142
Well, he said
that you hired McKenna

12:09.177 --> 12:10.444
as a special-assignment
coach.

12:10.478 --> 12:12.646
Oh, he had a special
assignment, all right.

12:12.680 --> 12:14.548
He was Manny Vega's
sober coach.

12:14.582 --> 12:17.451
You had a sober coach
for your star player?

12:17.485 --> 12:19.519
It's no secret
Manny has had issues.

12:19.554 --> 12:22.122
It was under control,
and then about three weeks ago,

12:22.156 --> 12:24.224
he started having
violent outbursts again.

12:24.258 --> 12:27.461
Didn't take a genius to
recognize that he needed help,

12:27.495 --> 12:28.795
so I brought in Ron --

12:28.830 --> 12:32.566
right before my asshole
ex-husband locked me out.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.735
But how is Vega passing
his alcohol-and-drug tests?

12:34.769 --> 12:35.836
Ask Phil.

12:35.870 --> 12:38.205
And while you're at it,

12:38.239 --> 12:40.474
tell him he won't have
my team for long.

12:40.508 --> 12:42.342
I'd lock her out, too.

12:42.377 --> 12:45.545
<i>Stepping up to bat, D.J. Nixon!</i>

12:45.580 --> 12:48.882
Rumor is, Phil's trying to sell
the team to Salt Lake City.

12:48.916 --> 12:51.351
The Utah Pilgrims?

12:51.386 --> 12:53.520
How long am I standing here?

12:53.554 --> 12:55.155
Until we have a warrant.

12:55.189 --> 12:57.724
Vega was a wicked drinker
in his New York days --

12:57.759 --> 13:00.260
locker-room brawls,
allegations of juicing.

13:00.294 --> 13:01.595
Well, maybe he snapped

13:01.629 --> 13:04.698
when his sober coach
tried to take away his tequila.

13:04.732 --> 13:06.533
Garbage?
Thank you.

13:06.567 --> 13:08.902
Hey! Y-you think I'm standing
here to throw away your mess?

13:19.747 --> 13:22.015
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:25.119 --> 13:27.788
These have never been worn.
This is brand-new.

13:28.723 --> 13:30.290
Backs of his shoes are wet.

13:30.324 --> 13:33.760
He was dragged into the shower
with his clothes on.

13:33.795 --> 13:36.229
He didn't die in the showers.

13:36.264 --> 13:38.665
This whole thing was staged.

13:47.475 --> 13:50.310
Oh, wait. Oh.
Up there. You see that?

13:50.344 --> 13:53.246
Directional bloodspatter.

13:53.281 --> 13:56.216
Somebody swung away in here.

13:56.250 --> 13:58.752
Mm-hmm.

14:00.555 --> 14:02.422
Smells like bleach.

14:02.457 --> 14:04.224
<i>The count is two and two.</i>

14:04.258 --> 14:06.159
<i>Lindbeck winds up,
delivers his knuckle ball.</i>

14:06.194 --> 14:07.360
<i>Vega swings.</i>

14:07.395 --> 14:10.097
<i>It's hit deep.</i>

14:10.131 --> 14:12.432
<i>Deep over
salgado's head, and...</i>

14:12.467 --> 14:13.500
<i>Gone!</i>

14:13.534 --> 14:16.403
Somebody cleaned up a murder.

14:17.705 --> 14:22.476
The murder weapon is a
cylindrical, heavy, hard object.

14:22.510 --> 14:24.444
Gee, what could it be?

14:24.479 --> 14:26.146
Think it's a pipe?

14:26.180 --> 14:27.614
A pipe is too thin.

14:27.648 --> 14:31.384
What about a majorette's baton?

14:31.419 --> 14:34.754
I'm glad that you find
my scientific approach amusing.

14:37.625 --> 14:38.959
I think it's a bat, Maura.

14:43.331 --> 14:44.764
Found blood.

14:44.799 --> 14:48.401
I think it's Manny Vega's bat.

14:51.405 --> 14:53.974
Let's compare it to the injury.

14:56.244 --> 15:00.580
The width of the barrel aligns
with the width of the fracture.

15:00.615 --> 15:03.583
So Vega's our best bet.

15:03.618 --> 15:06.820
Now, how do we prove
he swung the fatal blow?

15:06.854 --> 15:10.223
The way you always do --
do that gumshoe thing.

15:10.258 --> 15:12.192
"That gumshoe thing"?

15:12.226 --> 15:13.560
No, um, this time,

15:13.594 --> 15:16.596
we're actually up against
every baseball fan,

15:16.631 --> 15:18.198
from judges to the governor.

15:18.232 --> 15:20.467
So it makes it
a little difficult

15:20.501 --> 15:22.169
to do my gumshoe thing.

15:22.203 --> 15:25.305
Society's very reluctant
to hold celebrities accountable.

15:25.339 --> 15:26.540
Remember Fatty Arbuckle?

15:26.574 --> 15:28.508
Fatty Arbuckle?

15:28.543 --> 15:30.076
No.

15:30.111 --> 15:32.212
- The silent-film star who was tried --
- Stop.

15:32.246 --> 15:36.249
Hey, Jane, our victim
had multiple drug arrests.

15:38.085 --> 15:40.554
So, this is who they hire
to be the "sober coach"?

15:40.588 --> 15:43.123
Heard you got the warrant
for the dumpsters.

15:43.157 --> 15:45.392
Yeah. I got blood, too --
on Vega's bat.

15:47.361 --> 15:49.396
It's Korsak.

15:49.430 --> 15:50.764
He's interviewing
the victim's son.

15:50.798 --> 15:52.332
Can you figure out
what's going on

15:52.366 --> 15:53.733
with the searches
through the dumpsters?

15:53.768 --> 15:55.735
Yeah, yeah.
I'll check with Frankie.

15:55.770 --> 15:59.973
I'm off -- to do my...
Gumshoe thing.

16:00.007 --> 16:01.508
I shouldn't have used
that term.

16:01.542 --> 16:03.043
No, you shouldn't have.

16:03.077 --> 16:05.045
Because it actually
refers to galoshes,

16:05.079 --> 16:06.279
which you aren't wearing.

16:10.451 --> 16:12.953
What? I...
What did I say?

16:15.056 --> 16:18.391
We're very sorry for your loss.

16:18.426 --> 16:19.793
You're the only ones.

16:19.827 --> 16:21.328
The news, the radio --

16:21.362 --> 16:23.763
they're calling my dad
a scum bag.

16:23.798 --> 16:25.665
We will do everything we can
to find his killer.

16:25.700 --> 16:27.400
I hate to ask, but...

16:27.435 --> 16:30.870
Do you know anyone that might
have wanted to hurt your father?

16:32.073 --> 16:33.673
He's been clean
since my mom died.

16:33.708 --> 16:35.475
Pulled it together for me.

16:36.510 --> 16:38.445
How long had he been clean?

16:38.479 --> 16:39.446
Five years.

16:41.115 --> 16:44.818
He, uh, started an outreach
center to help people.

16:49.123 --> 16:51.191
Why don't they report that?

16:51.225 --> 16:52.759
Did your father
ever tell you anything

16:52.793 --> 16:55.128
about his work with Manny Vega?

16:56.364 --> 16:59.065
Just that he was
trying to help him.

16:59.100 --> 17:01.034
He helped a lot of those guys.

17:01.068 --> 17:02.669
You mean other ballplayers?

17:02.703 --> 17:04.436
Yeah.

17:04.472 --> 17:07.374
He blew his own shot
at the pros with drugs.

17:08.909 --> 17:13.113
That's
why he wasn't star-struck.

17:13.146 --> 17:18.084
He used to be one of them,
s-so he -- he could connect.

17:30.942 --> 17:33.110
You should come by
sometime with your kids.

17:33.145 --> 17:34.945
- Yeah.
- Good to see you.

17:34.980 --> 17:37.281
- Always a pleasure.
- All right.

17:37.315 --> 17:40.117
We just got shut down.

17:41.286 --> 17:44.355
Search warrant on Vega's
house and car was denied.

17:44.389 --> 17:46.490
No grand jury on Vega, either.

17:46.525 --> 17:48.159
What?

17:48.193 --> 17:50.394
How can Merck shut down
a grand-jury investigation?

17:50.429 --> 17:52.430
By delaying it till
after the playoffs.

17:52.464 --> 17:54.932
And all the heavies
are telling us to back off.

17:54.966 --> 17:57.234
Yeah, tell that
to Ron McKenna's son.

17:57.269 --> 18:00.004
I didn't tell you to stop,
Rizzoli.

18:00.872 --> 18:03.407
Now find a way to get to Vega.

18:04.876 --> 18:06.210
Nice.

18:06.244 --> 18:08.979
Cavanaugh just
took the gloves off. Come on.

18:14.052 --> 18:16.220
Hey, Mega.
Can I get an autograph?

18:16.254 --> 18:18.189
Give me the ball.
Let's go.

18:20.025 --> 18:21.492
Hey!

18:23.595 --> 18:25.129
Wow.

18:25.163 --> 18:27.098
Did you miss
your lucky bat today?

18:27.132 --> 18:28.132
We had to borrow it.

18:28.166 --> 18:29.834
You're a cop.

18:29.868 --> 18:31.936
Listen, get the hell away
from me and move your car.

18:31.970 --> 18:33.771
Oh, sorry.
Is that blocking you?

18:33.805 --> 18:37.374
Ron McKenna's blood is all over
your bat, Vega. How'd it get there?

18:38.243 --> 18:39.810
I'm not talking to you guys.

18:39.845 --> 18:41.912
I'm calling my lawyers.

18:41.947 --> 18:44.482
Ron bust you for drinking?
Maybe that's why you killed him.

18:45.450 --> 18:47.418
I didn't kill nobody.

18:47.452 --> 18:49.687
Now move your damn car.

18:53.959 --> 18:56.894
Phil, Merck,
your lawyers --

18:56.928 --> 18:59.196
they can't protect you forever.

19:00.832 --> 19:02.867
Get out of my face.

19:11.076 --> 19:13.410
At least I got his autograph.

19:15.814 --> 19:17.882
Did Merck's timeline check out?

19:17.916 --> 19:19.183
Yep.

19:19.217 --> 19:21.952
Victim goes in at 6:01 A.M.
never comes out.

19:21.987 --> 19:24.855
Cleaning lady goes in
at 9:30, out at 9:33.

19:24.890 --> 19:26.857
After she found the body.

19:26.892 --> 19:28.092
Players don't use key cards

19:28.126 --> 19:29.960
'cause they come through
the players gate.

19:29.995 --> 19:31.462
So, we're never gonna find
a record

19:31.496 --> 19:33.164
of Vega entering or exiting.

19:35.133 --> 19:36.967
Hey, turn it up.

19:37.002 --> 19:39.170
<i>Look, it's gross incompetence
by Boston police.</i>

19:39.204 --> 19:41.772
<i>This was an accident.
Ron McKenna slipped and fell.</i>

19:41.807 --> 19:43.140
What do we have
on this cream puff? Phil?

19:43.175 --> 19:44.942
Nothing, other than
he's an asshole.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.811
<i>Oh, look at all those
drug convictions.</i>

19:46.845 --> 19:48.712
<i>You guys were great
to give him a second chance.</i>

19:48.747 --> 19:50.781
<i>It's unfortunate he couldn't
cure his own addiction.</i>

19:50.816 --> 19:53.017
- You just -- you...
- What about Vega's drug tests?

19:53.051 --> 19:54.785
Every time he takes a leak,
someone's there with a cup.

19:54.820 --> 19:58.088
All negative. No steroids,
narcotics, or alcohol.

19:58.123 --> 20:00.191
That's according
to the team doctors.

20:00.225 --> 20:02.326
They got our backs
against the wall.

20:02.360 --> 20:04.094
Find somebody who will talk.

20:06.264 --> 20:08.365
Jesse Wade gave me his phone number.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.301
Maybe it's time to make a call.

20:11.570 --> 20:12.937
Yeah.

20:12.971 --> 20:14.471
A booty call.

20:15.907 --> 20:17.408
Really?

20:17.442 --> 20:19.276
Hey.

20:19.311 --> 20:22.913
What is "Le Beau Truc"?

20:22.948 --> 20:24.448
Five-star
French restaurant.

20:24.482 --> 20:26.517
Brilliant nouveau take
on escargot.

20:26.551 --> 20:28.118
Is this okay?

20:28.153 --> 20:29.286
Are you out of your mind?

20:30.188 --> 20:31.355
What?
I'm meeting Jesse Wade.

20:31.389 --> 20:32.823
He wants to do
the interview there.

20:32.858 --> 20:34.458
<i>At Le Beau Truc?
Yeah.</i>

20:34.492 --> 20:37.061
<i>Le booty call.</i>

20:38.096 --> 20:39.396
What did you just say?

20:40.398 --> 20:42.132
I know.

20:45.136 --> 20:47.037
Unzip me.

20:47.072 --> 20:48.138
Wh-- why?

20:48.173 --> 20:49.907
Because you can't go like that.

20:49.941 --> 20:51.508
We'll trade clothes.
Come on.

20:51.543 --> 20:52.877
Are you crazy?

20:52.911 --> 20:55.479
That dress wouldn't...
Cover my...Booty.

20:59.084 --> 21:01.285
It smells like a deco.

21:01.319 --> 21:05.389
Oh, men are not attracted
to the smell of death.

21:05.423 --> 21:07.291
Really?

21:07.325 --> 21:08.659
Okay, that's enough.

21:11.463 --> 21:12.796
Oh.

21:12.831 --> 21:16.133
Those boots
are fashion homicide.

21:17.969 --> 21:20.971
<i>No. No!
Those shoes are foot homicide.</i>

21:21.006 --> 21:23.841
Put them on.
They're too small.

21:23.875 --> 21:24.808
Give them back.

21:24.843 --> 21:26.443
You just said put them on!

21:26.478 --> 21:27.611
Patience.

21:35.253 --> 21:37.288
What are you do--

21:37.322 --> 21:38.455
Maura!

21:45.196 --> 21:48.198
VoilÃ . Peep toes.

21:50.168 --> 21:52.336
Thank you.

21:54.406 --> 21:55.439
Oh.

21:55.473 --> 21:57.207
You look sexy.

21:57.909 --> 21:58.976
You look...

21:59.010 --> 22:02.279
Like you're wearing my clothes.

22:02.281 --> 22:06.717
Hi, ma.

22:08.086 --> 22:09.119
Like you're wearing
okay. Calm down.

22:09.154 --> 22:11.088
All ri--
where are you?

22:11.890 --> 22:13.490
Okay.
I'll be right --

22:15.293 --> 22:17.294
I got 45 minutes.

22:17.329 --> 22:19.330
Come with me.
I'm gonna need backup.

22:19.364 --> 22:22.533
What?
Jane, what did Tommy do?

22:23.301 --> 22:25.970
Jane!
You have all the shoes!

22:26.004 --> 22:28.138
You think you can do that
to people, huh?

22:28.173 --> 22:31.041
Take advantage of them when they're
just trying to take care of their pets?

22:31.076 --> 22:32.810
You know what?
I'm gonna neuter you, punk!

22:32.844 --> 22:33.877
Hey. Tommy, stop.
Stop.

22:33.912 --> 22:34.878
I called the police.

22:34.913 --> 22:36.480
<i>I am the police.</i>

22:36.514 --> 22:37.781
Vice?

22:37.816 --> 22:38.949
Homicide.

22:38.984 --> 22:41.085
I'm not there yet,
but give me a minute.

22:41.119 --> 22:42.353
All right.
Relax.

22:42.387 --> 22:43.821
Just...What happened?

22:43.855 --> 22:46.190
Jo Friday was licking
her freaking paws off!

22:46.224 --> 22:47.524
Shhh!
I'm not talking to you.

22:47.559 --> 22:49.126
What happened?

22:49.160 --> 22:52.329
I was treating this patient,
uh, Jo Friday Rizzoli,

22:52.364 --> 22:55.099
and this man
is refusing to pay the bill.

22:55.133 --> 22:56.400
All right.
Well, that's fine.

22:56.434 --> 22:58.102
I got it. I will pay it.
How much is it?

22:58.136 --> 23:01.372
$300. What? What did you
do, bling her paws out?

23:01.406 --> 23:04.208
Exactly. And then he calls her
a freaking head case!

23:04.242 --> 23:06.677
No, no, no, no, no.
I did not use that terminology.

23:06.711 --> 23:08.746
I said, "she is suffering
from depression."

23:08.780 --> 23:10.814
She has been withdrawn,
restless,

23:10.849 --> 23:13.150
reluctant to go outside
and urinate.

23:13.184 --> 23:14.418
Whose side are you on?

23:15.353 --> 23:16.653
She sleeps, eats, poops.

23:16.688 --> 23:18.255
What's there
to be depressed about?

23:21.393 --> 23:23.460
N-- off, Jo Friday!

23:23.495 --> 23:25.696
It is an OCD reflex.

23:25.730 --> 23:28.399
It is triggered
by her emotional state.

23:28.433 --> 23:29.833
She needs prozac.

23:29.868 --> 23:30.868
Here we go.

23:30.902 --> 23:32.136
OCD, ADHD, alcoholic --

23:32.170 --> 23:34.171
same stuff they were
throwing at me in the joint!

23:34.205 --> 23:36.974
I'm not surprised
you were confined to a cage.

23:37.008 --> 23:38.409
Hey, hey, hey!

23:38.443 --> 23:40.778
Knock it off!

23:40.812 --> 23:42.079
Knock it off, all right?

23:42.113 --> 23:43.981
Take Jo Friday, go home!
Take her for a walk.

23:44.015 --> 23:46.984
You're already gonna blow
your curfew as it is. Come on.

23:50.321 --> 23:51.822
I'm so sorry.

23:51.856 --> 23:55.125
They really are
very nice people.

24:03.391 --> 24:05.092
- You look phenomenal.
- Thank you.

24:05.126 --> 24:07.061
I thought we ought to stay
kind of private.

24:07.095 --> 24:09.163
I'm not really supposed to be
talking to you.

24:09.197 --> 24:10.564
Well, I'm not
supposed to be drinking.

24:10.598 --> 24:12.299
I'm on the job, so...

24:12.333 --> 24:13.867
Um, tell me about Vega.

24:13.902 --> 24:17.204
You guys have been teammates
for, what, two seasons?

24:17.238 --> 24:18.472
Man, you get right into it.

24:18.506 --> 24:19.940
Yep.

24:19.974 --> 24:21.275
I don't know. Uh...

24:21.309 --> 24:23.177
Feels like he's losing it.

24:23.211 --> 24:24.578
What do you mean?

24:24.612 --> 24:27.981
Just acting crazy,
except when he takes the bat.

24:28.983 --> 24:31.819
<i>Well, do you think
he killed Ron McKenna?</i>

24:32.921 --> 24:35.022
You're the homicide detective.
What do you think?

24:35.056 --> 24:36.390
Well, it doesn't matter
what I think.

24:36.424 --> 24:38.225
- It matters what I can prove.
- Can you prove it?

24:38.259 --> 24:40.127
What was Ron McKenna doing
in the locker room at 6:00 A.M.?

24:40.161 --> 24:42.296
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

24:42.330 --> 24:44.932
Was he trying to prove that Vega
was drinking and drugging? What?

24:44.966 --> 24:47.601
Yeah. He was hell-bent
on it, so...Maybe, yeah.

24:47.635 --> 24:49.570
Well, you and Manny
are friends.

24:49.604 --> 24:51.538
Did you ever talk to Ron
about it, try to help?

24:51.573 --> 24:54.108
Ron came to me
the day before he died.

24:54.142 --> 24:57.010
Wanted my help staging
an intervention for Manny.

24:57.045 --> 24:58.178
I was up for it.

24:58.213 --> 25:00.147
But Vega's drug tests
came back clean.

25:00.181 --> 25:02.282
When you're the face
on the billboard,

25:02.317 --> 25:04.084
the name on a sports drink...

25:04.119 --> 25:06.186
Your pee has a tendency
to come back drug-free.

25:06.221 --> 25:07.955
Okay.

25:07.989 --> 25:11.725
You know, I didn't just...Come
here to talk about the case.

25:13.261 --> 25:14.795
You're such a beautiful woman.

25:14.829 --> 25:16.163
- I thought we'd have some wine.
- Thank you.

25:16.197 --> 25:19.233
Um, but, like I said,
I'm on the job.

25:20.935 --> 25:22.603
Okay.

25:23.938 --> 25:25.339
These suck.

25:25.373 --> 25:27.941
Ugh!

25:27.976 --> 25:31.378
And your dress is about as
comfortable as a straitjacket.

25:31.412 --> 25:34.381
Yeah, and your suit
is a real booty-call magnet.

25:34.415 --> 25:37.518
I got hit on twice --
by women.

25:37.552 --> 25:38.519
Really?

25:40.088 --> 25:42.289
Oh, no.
My tv -- it's gone.

25:42.323 --> 25:44.958
Somebody was in here.

25:44.993 --> 25:46.960
Ma! Tommy! Ma!

25:46.995 --> 25:49.229
Ma, come here!

25:50.999 --> 25:52.900
Jane, what's wrong?

25:54.102 --> 25:57.204
Oh, no.

25:57.238 --> 25:58.539
Tommy?

25:59.874 --> 26:02.476
Well, maybe it wasn't
Tommy. I...

26:02.510 --> 26:06.480
I told the Palumbos Tommy would
never steal their stereo.

26:06.514 --> 26:10.150
Tommy broke into some houses
when he was in high school.

26:10.185 --> 26:12.986
Um...He never should have been
staying here, Maura.

26:13.021 --> 26:14.755
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

26:14.789 --> 26:16.857
Oh, for the life of me!

26:16.891 --> 26:21.128
I don't understand why
your brother does what he does!

26:21.162 --> 26:22.162
All right, look.

26:22.197 --> 26:23.497
I'll call Frankie, okay,

26:23.531 --> 26:25.799
and then
we'll go look for Tommy.

26:25.833 --> 26:29.036
If he's on the run, it should be
us that find him, okay?

26:29.070 --> 26:32.506
Come here, ma.

26:32.540 --> 26:35.242
It's all right.
Okay?

26:35.276 --> 26:37.144
I'll find him.

26:43.618 --> 26:47.120
Oh, don't move, babe.
The police got us surrounded.

26:47.155 --> 26:49.323
You're so funny, Tommy.

26:49.357 --> 26:52.125
Actually, babe, move.

26:54.362 --> 26:58.432
So, uh, which one of youse
wants to...Take me in?

26:58.466 --> 26:59.967
Where'd you get
the money to buy

27:00.001 --> 27:01.268
the dinner and drinks
for the townie?

27:01.302 --> 27:03.237
- Did you pawn Maura's stuff?
- Huh?

27:03.271 --> 27:05.138
Maura's house was burglarized.

27:05.173 --> 27:06.540
Her tv, her jewelry...

27:06.574 --> 27:08.141
Her trust.

27:08.176 --> 27:09.243
She trusted you.

27:09.277 --> 27:11.678
- Oh, you think I did it?
- Did you?

27:15.416 --> 27:16.483
Yeah, sure.

27:16.517 --> 27:18.485
Recession's my fault,
mom and dad

27:18.519 --> 27:20.320
are getting divorced
because of me.

27:20.355 --> 27:22.990
War in the middle east --
that's me, too.

27:23.024 --> 27:24.424
Is that what you think?

27:24.459 --> 27:26.860
They're not getting a divorce
because of you, Tommy.

27:26.894 --> 27:28.528
They fought all the time.

27:28.563 --> 27:31.098
They fought over the freaking
leaves in the gutters, Tommy.

27:31.132 --> 27:32.833
<i>I am the freaking gutter.</i>

27:32.867 --> 27:35.569
It's detective Rizzoli,
officer Rizzoli,

27:35.603 --> 27:37.070
and Tommy the screw-up.

27:37.105 --> 27:40.340
That's what you've chosen.
That's not who you are.

27:41.509 --> 27:44.378
<i>We have a breaking story.
Manny "Mega" Vega...</i>

27:44.412 --> 27:46.413
Hey, could you
turn that up, please?

27:46.447 --> 27:48.382
<i>Has been killed
in an automobile accident.</i>

27:48.416 --> 27:51.351
<i>Details at this time
are inconclusive,</i>

27:51.386 --> 27:53.920
<i>but detectives are looking into the matter.
- Oh, geez.</i>

27:53.955 --> 27:56.757
<i>Of course, we'll have much more
on this story as it develops.</i>

27:56.791 --> 27:58.225
Tommy,
you're on your own tonight.

27:58.259 --> 27:59.960
No babysitters for you.

27:59.994 --> 28:01.928
<i>Once again, Manny "Mega" Vega,</i>

28:01.963 --> 28:03.930
<i>Boston Pilgrims
baseball superstar,</i>

28:03.965 --> 28:06.800
<i>has died tonight
in a fatal car accident.</i>

28:06.834 --> 28:11.004
Wonder if he'll go down as one
of the best hitters of all time

28:11.039 --> 28:14.308
or the baseball star
who murdered his sober coach

28:14.342 --> 28:16.043
and then died in a D.U.I.

28:16.077 --> 28:19.212
Got the results from the
contents of the sports bottle.

28:19.247 --> 28:20.514
Oh, from his car?
That was fast.

28:20.548 --> 28:21.948
I processed it myself.

28:21.983 --> 28:23.116
That guy was my hero.

28:23.151 --> 28:25.185
I wanted to know
if he was loaded.

28:25.219 --> 28:26.219
Was he?

28:26.254 --> 28:27.988
Can you put it down here?

28:32.260 --> 28:34.161
No.

28:34.195 --> 28:37.097
Glucose water, "B" vitamins,
taurine, ginseng, caffeine.

28:37.131 --> 28:40.233
No drugs, alcohol, or steroids?

28:40.268 --> 28:42.169
No.

28:42.203 --> 28:43.937
This is strange.

28:43.971 --> 28:46.340
Cardiomyopathy.

28:46.374 --> 28:48.408
He has an enlarged heart.

28:48.443 --> 28:49.543
Congenital?

28:49.577 --> 28:51.478
No. Recent damage.

28:57.051 --> 29:00.787
Maura, you have that
"I have a case-solving hunch"

29:00.822 --> 29:02.055
look on your face.

29:02.090 --> 29:05.859
My face doesn't hunch.
It's minor pruritus.

29:05.893 --> 29:06.893
Excuse me?

29:06.928 --> 29:08.362
An itch.

29:08.396 --> 29:10.731
Hmm.

29:12.633 --> 29:15.001
His kidneys are damaged.

29:15.036 --> 29:16.803
Look at that crystallization.

29:16.838 --> 29:18.972
Yeah. From what?

29:19.006 --> 29:20.974
I'd be guessing.

29:21.008 --> 29:24.911
God, it's torture sometimes.

29:24.946 --> 29:27.180
Have you seen this before?

29:28.116 --> 29:29.583
Yes.

29:29.617 --> 29:31.351
Okay. Good.

29:31.386 --> 29:33.086
What did it turn out to be...

29:33.121 --> 29:34.254
Before

29:35.423 --> 29:38.325
ethylene glycol ingestion.

29:38.359 --> 29:40.861
Antifreeze?

29:40.895 --> 29:43.163
Someone was poisoning him.

29:49.166 --> 29:52.268
Somebody was poisoning Vega
over a three-week period.

29:52.302 --> 29:56.038
Was it Merck, Phil, Geena,
or one of his teammates?

29:56.073 --> 29:58.007
Look, we've got nothing
without motive.

29:58.041 --> 29:59.442
McKenna is collateral damage.

29:59.476 --> 30:02.511
Now, somebody was after Vega.
Who and why?

30:02.546 --> 30:05.648
Okay, it's got to be somebody
who could get into the locker room

30:05.682 --> 30:06.949
through the players gate,

30:06.984 --> 30:08.617
which says "teammate" to me.

30:11.455 --> 30:12.488
Wait.

30:12.522 --> 30:14.190
Frost, can you go on Youtube

30:14.224 --> 30:17.159
and pull up that dugout fight
between Jacobs and Vega?

30:17.194 --> 30:19.962
They were going at it
in the locker room.

30:19.997 --> 30:21.130
Okay.

30:33.610 --> 30:35.111
<i>Get out of my face!</i>

30:35.145 --> 30:36.946
Hate's a powerful motive.

30:39.683 --> 30:42.685
Maura's got something
on our first vic -- sober coach.

30:51.595 --> 30:54.063
You can't look
at a little vitreous fluid?

30:54.097 --> 30:55.431
- Coming out of an eyeball?
- Come on.

30:55.465 --> 30:56.866
You said you had something.

30:56.900 --> 30:58.167
What are we doing
standing here?

30:58.201 --> 31:00.002
Time of death
is always hard to pin down.

31:00.037 --> 31:01.337
It's even harder in this case.

31:01.371 --> 31:03.039
You could be
a little more patient.

31:03.073 --> 31:05.408
Job was like a cranky toddler
compared to me.

31:05.442 --> 31:07.376
You spoke to Frankie?

31:07.411 --> 31:09.145
He's still going through
all 12 dumpsters

31:09.179 --> 31:11.313
with every division detective
we could spring loose.

31:11.348 --> 31:12.948
And why aren't you there?

31:12.983 --> 31:15.384
Oh, I know.
"Ew! I hate eyeball fluid.

31:15.419 --> 31:18.154
Ew, I'm afraid of garbage."

31:18.188 --> 31:20.222
Why aren't you there?
I know.

31:20.257 --> 31:23.159
Might mess up that nice
sport coat from 1989.

31:23.193 --> 31:25.061
All right.
Come on.

31:25.095 --> 31:26.328
So, Geena hired McKenna

31:26.363 --> 31:28.431
because she thought
Vega was drinking again.

31:28.465 --> 31:31.067
Yeah. She said he'd been
having violent outbursts.

31:31.101 --> 31:34.470
Ethylene-glycol poisoning
mimics inebriation.

31:34.504 --> 31:38.340
But we didn't find any traces of
antifreeze in Vega's water bottle.

31:38.375 --> 31:40.076
Yeah, at least
not the one in his car.

31:40.110 --> 31:41.577
No, w-- that's it.
Wait a minute.

31:41.611 --> 31:43.612
Uh, baseball players
are real superstitious, right?

31:43.647 --> 31:45.247
Oh, Mark McGwire
wore the same cup

31:45.282 --> 31:47.149
from his
high-school-playing days

31:47.184 --> 31:49.351
until it was stolen from him
late in his career.

31:49.386 --> 31:51.987
Clemens put tiger balm
on his bal--

31:52.022 --> 31:54.156
- His balls?
- Yeah.

31:54.191 --> 31:56.459
Don't they inspect those
before they're allowed to pitch?

32:00.230 --> 32:01.931
Different...

32:01.965 --> 32:03.232
Balls, Dr. Isles.

32:03.266 --> 32:04.733
Oh.

32:06.036 --> 32:08.003
Let's just say they --
they have some weird rituals.

32:09.272 --> 32:12.074
Yeah, like drinking from the
same blinged-out game bottle.

32:12.109 --> 32:14.343
Let's test
the one in his locker.

32:16.146 --> 32:18.581
This is definitely the source
of the ethylene glycol.

32:18.615 --> 32:21.283
So our killer was spiking
Vega's special game bottle.

32:21.318 --> 32:23.486
Easy access --
just sitting in his locker.

32:23.520 --> 32:26.055
Just had to wait until
the locker room was empty.

32:26.089 --> 32:28.190
Poor Ron McKenna --
he suspects Vega's drinking,

32:28.225 --> 32:30.292
decides to check his locker
after the game...

32:30.327 --> 32:32.094
Catches the murderer
red-handed.

32:32.129 --> 32:34.063
Killer grabs Vega's bat,
whacks McKenna in the head,

32:34.097 --> 32:35.331
drags him to the showers.

32:35.365 --> 32:36.899
Smashes his skull
against the tile,

32:36.933 --> 32:38.134
stages a slip-and-fall
accident.

32:38.168 --> 32:40.236
Clark Jacobs could be our guy.

32:40.270 --> 32:43.005
He's got a locker
right next to Vega.

32:43.039 --> 32:45.574
There it is -- results
for the hypoxanthine test.

32:47.978 --> 32:50.079
The vitreous fluid
from the eye.

32:50.113 --> 32:51.180
<i>You did have a hunch.</i>

32:51.214 --> 32:52.915
No, I simply couldn't explain

32:52.949 --> 32:54.583
his advanced stage
of rigor mortis.

32:54.618 --> 32:57.153
And here's why --

32:57.187 --> 33:02.224
'cause Ron McKenna
wasn't murdered at 6:00 A.M.

33:02.259 --> 33:04.226
At midnight?

33:04.261 --> 33:07.396
So why did Merck and his
key card say 6:00 A.M.?

33:07.430 --> 33:10.199
I think our buddy Merck
is lying to us.

33:10.233 --> 33:13.135
You're looking at
an accessory to murder.

33:13.170 --> 33:15.304
Whoa.
I didn't kill anybody.

33:15.338 --> 33:16.972
So why'd you alter
his key-card entry time?

33:17.007 --> 33:18.340
I didn't.

33:18.375 --> 33:20.075
Well, maybe he's a zombie.

33:20.110 --> 33:23.179
That's why he took a shower
six hours after he died.

33:26.049 --> 33:28.584
Maybe you got me
on obstruction...

33:28.618 --> 33:30.019
But not murder.

33:30.053 --> 33:31.287
Okay.

33:31.922 --> 33:33.322
- Works for me.
- Hey.

33:33.356 --> 33:34.390
Hey, hey.

33:38.595 --> 33:39.828
We thought Manny did it.

33:41.031 --> 33:45.434
- I was told to protect him.
- Who told you to do that?

33:45.468 --> 33:48.370
You learn that trick in all
your years as a homicide cop?

33:48.405 --> 33:51.373
Lawyering up
like the scum bag you are?

33:57.881 --> 34:01.116
I say either Phil or Geena
told Merck to protect Vega.

34:01.151 --> 34:06.188
Whoa. Crime-scene techs found
Vega's contract on his computer.

34:07.924 --> 34:10.492
Whoa.
$15 million a year.

34:10.527 --> 34:12.161
Plus, Phil and Geena
sweetened the deal.

34:12.195 --> 34:13.963
They each gave him
a piece of the team.

34:13.996 --> 34:15.998
1% each.

34:16.032 --> 34:17.533
Yeah, nice chunk,
since that franchise

34:17.567 --> 34:19.101
is worth
half a billion dollars.

34:19.135 --> 34:20.101
Right.

34:20.136 --> 34:21.237
Huh.
Read the fine print.

34:21.271 --> 34:23.005
If Vega tests positive

34:23.039 --> 34:24.974
for drugs or alcohol or dies,

34:25.007 --> 34:27.409
both team owners
get their shares back.

34:27.444 --> 34:30.279
Puts Phil and Geena
right back at square one

34:30.313 --> 34:31.447
without their star.

34:31.481 --> 34:32.614
What's the motive?

34:32.649 --> 34:34.650
What's that addendum?

34:36.085 --> 34:38.286
Okay, that's weird.

34:38.321 --> 34:39.888
Three weeks ago,

34:39.922 --> 34:42.190
Vega gave Phil his entire
2% share of the team.

34:42.225 --> 34:43.225
Why?

34:43.260 --> 34:45.027
Give Phil control?

34:45.061 --> 34:47.029
That's how Phil
took the team from Geena.

34:47.063 --> 34:49.831
- He must have had a side deal with Vega.
- He had to.

34:49.866 --> 34:52.101
It's the only way Phil
could sell the team to Utah.

34:52.135 --> 34:55.170
Yeah, and then Geena discovers
that she was betrayed by Vega.

34:55.205 --> 34:56.772
That's motive. You know?

34:56.806 --> 34:59.808
Maybe she -- she hired Merck
to do the dirty work.

35:02.379 --> 35:03.479
Well, well, well.

35:04.914 --> 35:07.249
Merck just got bailed out --
by Geena.

35:07.284 --> 35:08.884
And Tommy didn't do it.

35:08.918 --> 35:10.119
What?

35:10.153 --> 35:12.354
Division-one detectives
matched fingerprints

35:12.389 --> 35:14.757
from Dr. Isles' bedroom
to a burglary ring.

35:14.791 --> 35:16.125
They've made arrests
and got all her stuff back.

35:16.159 --> 35:18.594
That's fantastic!

35:20.096 --> 35:21.096
Oh!

35:21.131 --> 35:22.531
Hey, Frankie.

35:22.565 --> 35:24.600
No, listen to this.

35:24.634 --> 35:26.135
You what?

35:27.103 --> 35:28.937
Hi.

35:28.972 --> 35:31.273
I think we found
the needle in the haystack.

35:31.308 --> 35:32.474
Unbelievable.
Let me see.

35:46.356 --> 35:48.057
Gotcha.

35:55.415 --> 35:57.283
I know we got nothing
on the outside,

35:57.317 --> 35:58.684
but what about on the inside?

35:58.718 --> 36:00.252
Can you get a print?

36:00.287 --> 36:02.488
This is not "CSI: Boston,"
Jane, okay?

36:02.522 --> 36:05.791
It's a very delicate process,
and it's not always successful.

36:05.826 --> 36:08.928
<i>Be great if it was
successful this time.</i>

36:10.897 --> 36:14.667
I can't concentrate.
Did you apologize to Tommy?

36:14.701 --> 36:16.402
No, but I will.

36:16.436 --> 36:18.771
- Let's just get the bad guys first, all right?
- All right.

36:18.805 --> 36:20.806
Well, why don't you go
and apologize to him,

36:20.841 --> 36:22.942
and I'll call you
if I get any latent prints.

36:22.976 --> 36:24.543
"If"?

36:24.578 --> 36:27.513
N-- the reason you have
these gloves to work with

36:27.547 --> 36:28.848
is because I gumshoed.

36:28.882 --> 36:31.650
The least you can do
is get me some prints.

36:32.853 --> 36:34.987
What are you --
why are you stopping?

36:35.021 --> 36:36.488
What are you doing?

36:36.523 --> 36:37.623
Waiting for you to leave.

36:37.657 --> 36:39.592
Wh--
you are ridiculous.

36:41.884 --> 36:44.720
Fine. Bye.

36:55.340 --> 36:56.775
Tommy?

36:58.478 --> 36:59.879
Tommy?

37:03.216 --> 37:05.351
What, you gonna
make me use the siren?

37:10.357 --> 37:12.558
Knock it off.

37:12.592 --> 37:14.960
You're scaring Lola and Finn.

37:19.266 --> 37:23.168
We caught the burglars.
Maura got all her stuff back.

37:23.203 --> 37:25.704
Well, that's too bad 'cause
I was really looking forward

37:25.739 --> 37:27.940
to three square meals a day
and a clean jumpsuit.

37:27.974 --> 37:29.441
Go home.

37:29.476 --> 37:30.876
I don't have a home.

37:30.911 --> 37:32.478
Yes, you do.

37:32.512 --> 37:34.847
Maura said that you can stay
as long as you need to.

37:34.881 --> 37:37.149
Ma wants you there.
Maura wants you there.

37:41.688 --> 37:44.290
You know what's great
about dogs?

37:44.324 --> 37:45.391
Tell me.

37:45.425 --> 37:48.560
They're in the same mood
every day.

37:48.595 --> 37:50.696
And they think I'm a good guy.

37:55.535 --> 37:57.269
They're good
judges of character, Tommy.

37:57.304 --> 37:58.604
Yeah.

37:58.638 --> 38:02.374
They'd like a serial killer
if he had lamb lungs.

38:02.409 --> 38:04.543
I'm sorry.

38:04.577 --> 38:06.745
I'm really, really sorry.

38:06.780 --> 38:09.615
It's okay.

38:09.649 --> 38:12.885
I would have thought
I did it, too.

38:15.889 --> 38:18.390
I got to walk them.

38:18.425 --> 38:20.426
I'm on the job.

38:20.460 --> 38:22.361
You're a dog walker?
That's great.

38:22.395 --> 38:25.397
Oh, yeah.
Mom and dad will be so proud.

38:25.432 --> 38:26.932
See you later.

38:32.772 --> 38:35.474
Tell me you got a print.

38:36.710 --> 38:37.843
Yeah!

38:41.815 --> 38:43.349
- Way to go.
- Thank you.

38:43.383 --> 38:44.616
- Way to go.
- Thank you.

38:44.651 --> 38:46.518
Great game.
That was a great game.

38:46.553 --> 38:48.854
Whoo! Thank you. It was close.
Congratulations.

38:48.888 --> 38:50.823
Hey, you can't be in here!

38:50.857 --> 38:54.226
Keep talking,
I'll have your bail revoked.

38:54.260 --> 38:55.461
Phil...

38:56.596 --> 39:00.232
You screwed Geena
out of her team.

39:00.266 --> 39:01.467
And, Geena,

39:01.501 --> 39:03.235
you would do almost anything

39:03.269 --> 39:05.537
to get that team back,
wouldn't you?

39:06.806 --> 39:08.007
And, Merck...

39:10.176 --> 39:11.844
You just do what you're told.

39:12.779 --> 39:14.380
And, Jesse...

39:14.414 --> 39:16.515
Hey.

39:16.549 --> 39:18.717
You wanted to be a superstar.

39:20.286 --> 39:23.489
I got to admit, you got balls
taking a cop to dinner.

39:23.523 --> 39:25.824
Did you think
you could charm me, too?

39:33.700 --> 39:36.468
You wanted
what Vega had --

39:36.503 --> 39:38.704
face on the billboard,
name on the sports drink.

39:38.738 --> 39:40.439
What's this about, officer?

39:40.473 --> 39:42.708
Detective.

39:42.742 --> 39:45.778
I think Jesse knows what this
is about, don't you, Jesse?

39:48.982 --> 39:51.884
I worked for this.

39:51.918 --> 39:54.186
Everything was handed to him.

39:54.220 --> 39:55.988
He drank and drugged,
and they just kept...

39:56.022 --> 39:57.923
Giving him more.

39:57.957 --> 39:59.124
My God. No.

40:00.560 --> 40:01.860
You killed Manny?

40:04.764 --> 40:06.398
Turn around, Jesse.

40:06.433 --> 40:08.801
You're under arrest
for the murders

40:08.835 --> 40:11.170
of Manny Vega and Ron McKenna.

40:20.814 --> 40:22.114
A little to the left.

40:26.719 --> 40:28.620
Center it a little.

40:30.423 --> 40:31.890
Wait, don't --
don't drop it, Korsak.

40:31.925 --> 40:33.759
This thing costs more
than you make in a month.

40:33.793 --> 40:35.661
<i>That's still more than you make
in six months.</i>

40:35.695 --> 40:38.230
Dinner time!

40:38.264 --> 40:40.632
Hello, Jo Friday!

40:40.667 --> 40:42.401
You want your dinner?
Yes.

40:42.435 --> 40:44.203
You feed that dog chicken?

40:44.237 --> 40:46.438
It's organic.

40:46.473 --> 40:49.808
She licking her paws?
Yeah, nonstop.

40:49.843 --> 40:51.310
What? It's not funny.

40:51.344 --> 40:53.178
I paid 300 bucks.
She's still licking.

40:53.213 --> 40:55.247
Because a lot of little dogs
like her

40:55.281 --> 40:56.448
are allergic to poultry.

40:56.483 --> 40:58.550
Oh.

41:02.021 --> 41:05.357
"Well, she has been
withdrawn and restless,

41:05.391 --> 41:08.494
reluctant to go outside
and urinate."

41:08.528 --> 41:09.862
Well, excuse me.

41:09.896 --> 41:12.164
I don't treat mixed breeds
or four-legged creatures

41:12.198 --> 41:15.234
- or anything else --
- that's alive. Yeah, I forgot.

41:15.268 --> 41:17.536
Okay, knock it off, you two.
Get the salad.

41:17.570 --> 41:19.505
Would you like me
to reimburse you

41:19.539 --> 41:20.939
for misdiagnosing your dog?

41:20.974 --> 41:22.407
- Stop it.
- Yes.

41:22.442 --> 41:24.243
Yes, I would, actually.
That'd be nice.

41:24.277 --> 41:26.979
Would a check be okay, or
would you feel safer with cash?

41:27.013 --> 41:28.947
Cash. Cash is good.
