WEBVTT

00:03.804 --> 00:05.439
No, no, no!

00:05.539 --> 00:08.208
[Karen]: Previously on
"Sistas"...

00:08.308 --> 00:10.077
What exactly was
that about, Karen?

00:10.177 --> 00:11.612
Yeah, whose so in love
with Zac?

00:11.712 --> 00:13.213
I wanted to have
that moment, okay, you happy?

00:13.313 --> 00:14.848
Was it worth it?

00:14.948 --> 00:16.250
No.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.751
Thank you for today.

00:17.851 --> 00:18.986
Come on, now.

00:19.086 --> 00:20.420
You know that wasn't
quid pro quo.

00:20.521 --> 00:23.924
I know, but I like feelin'
like I owe you somethin'.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.627
You're going for a minimum
of ten to fifteen years.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.263
-What?!
-Andi, I'll see you in court.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.864
What the --, bro?

00:34.601 --> 00:35.869
-What the --.
-Zac...

00:35.969 --> 00:38.939
-What?
-Hey, hold on. How can this be?

00:39.039 --> 00:42.242
-I don't know, but it is.
-That is not my baby, bro.

00:42.342 --> 00:45.579
We've all heard that before.
Enjoy your time in here.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.714
You gotta be kidding me.

00:47.814 --> 00:49.550
You gotta be kidding me!

00:49.650 --> 00:51.151
See you later, Andi.

00:54.354 --> 00:57.324
Okay, this is some bullshit,
Andi.

00:57.424 --> 00:59.660
Hold on, just let me
make a few phone calls, okay?

00:59.760 --> 01:01.395
Okay.
I'll be right back. Okay?

01:01.495 --> 01:02.896
This is some bullshit!

01:06.633 --> 01:07.601
Damn.

01:07.701 --> 01:08.869
Hey.

01:08.969 --> 01:10.370
Why are you so calm
about this?

01:10.470 --> 01:12.172
Because we're gonna
figure it out.

01:12.272 --> 01:15.576
There's nothing to figure out,
that's not my kid!

01:15.676 --> 01:17.211
Well, Zac...

01:17.311 --> 01:19.847
Don't, yo.
Don't "well, Zac" me.

01:19.947 --> 01:22.416
What do you want me to do?
Get upset, too?

01:22.516 --> 01:24.051
Yes!

01:24.151 --> 01:26.954
And what good is
that gonna do?

01:27.054 --> 01:29.289
This is the same chick that
had kids beat up Hayden...

01:29.389 --> 01:31.058
Hey, hey!
Hey.

01:31.158 --> 01:33.727
What?
They're listening.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.395
Oh, now you want me
to be quiet.

01:35.495 --> 01:38.131
Yes. You're here,
and I need you to bring it down.

01:38.232 --> 01:40.234
Be quiet.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.603
Fatima, I just can't,
every time I start to come up.

01:42.703 --> 01:43.937
Every time...

01:44.037 --> 01:45.405
Let's just...
Babe.

01:45.506 --> 01:48.242
Let's just see
what Andi can find out, okay?

01:48.342 --> 01:50.043
Every time I'm about
to come up,

01:50.143 --> 01:52.279
shit just falls apart.

01:52.379 --> 01:55.048
-It's not gonna fall apart.
-You don't know that.

01:55.148 --> 01:56.850
Will you look at me?
Look at me.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.620
-I'm looking!
-Have I let you down yet?

02:02.089 --> 02:03.924
That's the problem.

02:04.024 --> 02:05.959
What?
Have I?

02:06.059 --> 02:09.062
No, you haven't.
Okay?

02:09.162 --> 02:10.998
But I'm tired of women
doin' shit for me!

02:11.098 --> 02:13.100
At this point in my life,
I finally got money.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.335
I should be able to
do shit for myself.

02:15.435 --> 02:18.438
Not depending on Andi,
or Fatima, or Danni.

02:20.641 --> 02:24.745
Or Karen?

02:24.845 --> 02:27.314
Look, Zac.
You're okay.

02:27.414 --> 02:29.583
All right?
Just because we know people,

02:29.683 --> 02:32.152
don't mean we're helpin' you.

02:32.252 --> 02:34.721
It's just what we do for each
other in situations like this,

02:34.821 --> 02:37.658
And you just happen
to be my man.

02:37.758 --> 02:38.926
All right?

02:39.026 --> 02:40.994
Damn.

02:41.094 --> 02:43.697
I'm really tired, man.

02:43.797 --> 02:46.333
I'm tired of this, man.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.702
Let's just see what
Andi can find out,

02:48.802 --> 02:50.971
and after that...

02:51.071 --> 02:54.474
What if she can't
find out nothin'?

02:54.575 --> 02:57.211
As I was gonna say...

02:57.311 --> 03:00.180
After that, I will break you
out this bitch,

03:00.280 --> 03:03.750
and we gonna be on the run.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.285
That's not funny.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.790
You think I'm joking?

03:12.993 --> 03:15.028
You better be.

03:15.128 --> 03:17.397
All right.
I told you I was crazy.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.203
And you'd better come home.

03:23.303 --> 03:25.105
It's gonna be all right.

<i>-[Robin]: It's going good.</i>

04:11.652 --> 04:14.655
Your friend Hayden
has been avoiding me.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.964
What's that I hear

04:25.465 --> 04:27.701
I love that you can do that.

04:27.801 --> 04:28.735
What?

04:28.836 --> 04:30.737
You can sense when
something's wrong.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.009
Well, you just have to listen.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.212
Most people don't listen.

04:38.312 --> 04:39.847
Especially men.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.751
I know exactly what you mean.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.920
So, what is it?

04:47.020 --> 04:49.056
It is Zac.

04:49.156 --> 04:51.491
The DA came into the
interrogation room,

04:51.592 --> 04:54.895
and said that his probation
had been extended

04:54.995 --> 04:57.631
because of back child support.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.033
-What?
-Yeah.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.102
<i>[Robin]: And he had no idea?</i>

05:02.202 --> 05:05.539
He didn't even know
about a child.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.674
Well, I don't see how
they can do that.

05:07.774 --> 05:09.643
Especially if he didn't get any
information from his

05:09.743 --> 05:11.211
parole officer for a court date.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.313
Yeah, he said he didn't know.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.149
Andi...

05:16.250 --> 05:18.085
<i>[Andi]: Yes?</i>

05:18.185 --> 05:19.753
Do you trust this guy?

05:21.755 --> 05:23.824
Yeah, yeah.

05:25.392 --> 05:28.762
You're willing to stick
your neck out for him?

05:28.862 --> 05:30.797
Yes.
I would.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.003
Okay, then onto the
other question.

05:36.103 --> 05:38.305
Go for it.

05:38.405 --> 05:40.040
Are you sleeping with him?

05:42.242 --> 05:44.444
Zac?
No, never.

05:44.545 --> 05:47.147
That's, my best friend
dated him.

05:47.247 --> 05:48.916
No.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.552
All right, all right.
Well, it's just, this is a lot

05:51.652 --> 05:53.253
of trouble to go through
for someone.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.989
So, he must be pretty special.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.357
I believe in him.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.593
And I think he deserves
a fair shot.

05:59.693 --> 06:03.797
Okay.
Well who was his DA?

06:03.897 --> 06:05.832
DA Jefferson.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.668
<i>[Robin]: No, he's an</i>
<i>assistant DA.</i>

06:07.768 --> 06:10.370
Oh.

06:10.470 --> 06:13.006
Okay, well, I went to school
with the DA's daughter.

06:13.106 --> 06:16.410
So, I'll give her a call,
and I'll get right back to you.

06:18.345 --> 06:19.947
Quick question?

06:20.047 --> 06:22.082
<i>[Robin]: What?</i>

06:22.182 --> 06:24.651
Did you sleep with her?

06:26.253 --> 06:28.655
No, why?

06:29.990 --> 06:32.392
Well, you asked me about Zac.
So...

06:35.128 --> 06:37.598
Are we jealous, now?

06:37.698 --> 06:40.968
No, we just...
Asking questions, right?

06:43.070 --> 06:44.538
Fair play.

06:46.773 --> 06:48.008
You got it.

06:49.576 --> 06:53.013
All right.
I'll make the call right now.

06:53.113 --> 06:55.482
Okay, should I wait here, or?

06:55.582 --> 06:57.017
Give me ten minutes.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.386
[Andi]: Okay.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.909
Thank you.

07:22.009 --> 07:24.611
Of course.
Sit.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.648
Don't mind if I do.

07:33.620 --> 07:36.023
You look nice.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.324
No, ma'am.

07:37.424 --> 07:38.859
[Que]: What?

07:38.959 --> 07:40.394
I'm not having it.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.095
-Okay.
-[Maurice]: Thank you.

07:42.196 --> 07:43.797
Mm-hm.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.966
Hey, I'm um, I'm gonna go
look for a job.

07:47.568 --> 07:50.437
-Good.
-Mm-hm, It's really good.

07:50.537 --> 07:52.472
You have any ideas?

07:54.408 --> 07:56.043
You know what?

07:56.143 --> 07:59.179
Maybe you should go down
to the bank and apply.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.481
-You think I could?
-Mm-hm.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.984
Management would love to
hire someone

08:04.084 --> 08:06.486
who robbed the place.

08:06.587 --> 08:07.988
You're being funny.

08:08.088 --> 08:11.225
I'm serious.
I think it makes perfect sense.

08:11.325 --> 08:13.660
Okay, well, I'm gonna go see
if any of the restaurants

08:13.760 --> 08:15.128
around here are hiring.

08:15.229 --> 08:17.431
Maybe I can clean up,
or do the dishes or something.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.399
Good, that's great.
[Que]: I'm serious.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.401
I'm tired of hustling.

08:21.502 --> 08:23.604
[Maurice]: Okay, Que.

08:23.704 --> 08:28.141
Happy that you're going to do
something besides be here.

08:28.242 --> 08:29.610
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

08:29.710 --> 08:34.615
Oh, well, look.
The drunk is alive.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.985
Look, man.
Don't start.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.953
[Que]: Here.

08:40.053 --> 08:43.290
What's this?
It'll help with the hangover.

08:43.390 --> 08:45.259
What's in it?
Just drink it.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.262
Nah, I'll pass.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.197
Wow.
Y'all don't trust me?

08:50.297 --> 08:51.732
No offense.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.801
Child, you should trust him
after yester-night.

08:54.902 --> 08:57.504
What are you talkin' about?

08:57.604 --> 08:59.206
You don't remember?

08:59.306 --> 09:01.141
Maurice...

09:01.241 --> 09:03.377
You were that drunk?

09:03.477 --> 09:05.279
No, I wasn't.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.414
Well, what I remember,

09:07.514 --> 09:13.253
was you and Que in my bed.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.621
Stop lying.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.757
I'm tellin' you the truth!

09:16.857 --> 09:19.760
Maurice, don't go spreading
rumors like you did before.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.461
That's the reason me
and Sabrina in this shit

09:21.562 --> 09:22.863
we are in right now.

09:22.963 --> 09:26.200
Well, good thing I have
a picture in my phone.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.669
-What?
-My video... Mm-hm.

09:30.304 --> 09:33.607
-What the --?
-Yeah, you were really drunk.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.042
[Calvin]: And what are
you doing?

09:35.142 --> 09:37.878
You don't see all that
vomit in the trash can?

09:37.978 --> 09:40.280
-Shit.
-I was tryin' to help you.

09:42.649 --> 09:45.419
Why don't you have on pants?

09:45.519 --> 09:46.987
I was out here asleep,

09:47.087 --> 09:49.857
and I heard you bein' sick,
and I went in there to help you.

09:49.957 --> 09:52.726
What kinda help
were you tryin' to give me?

09:52.826 --> 09:54.394
You know people
throw up and die.

09:54.494 --> 09:56.196
I was just tryin' to help you.

09:56.296 --> 09:59.533
Calvin got good gag reflexes.

09:59.633 --> 10:02.536
Shut up.
Now, that's embarrassing.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.671
Yeah, it is.

10:04.771 --> 10:08.008
You wanna know what's
more embarrassing?

10:08.108 --> 10:11.678
What you wanted him
to do to you.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.648
-He's lying.
-I know he is, I know me.

10:14.748 --> 10:18.585
Mm, but you don't know
white girl wasted Calvin.

10:18.685 --> 10:21.221
-Shut up.
-Oh, I love a me.

10:22.890 --> 10:26.226
Let me know when you wanna
bring her back out.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.629
I, I can't with you.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.069
Bye.

10:36.170 --> 10:38.205
You shouldn't lie
to him like that, right?

10:38.305 --> 10:40.541
Shut up!
And fix me some juice.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.042
Wow, like that?

10:42.142 --> 10:44.411
You pay rent?

10:44.511 --> 10:46.446
You right.

10:46.547 --> 10:47.948
Serve me.

10:50.918 --> 10:56.590
Serve me, and get me a fork
and a knife and a spoon!

10:56.690 --> 10:58.158
Maurice...

10:58.258 --> 10:59.793
Juice me.

11:07.134 --> 11:09.870
I love it here.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.505
A fork?

11:11.605 --> 11:13.240
Comin' right up.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.043
And a spoon.
A spoon?

11:17.911 --> 11:20.681
What you need a spoon for,
huh?

11:23.650 --> 11:25.552
It's amazing
how you can ask me what I need,

11:25.652 --> 11:27.921
and you need a place to stay.

11:33.794 --> 11:37.097

<i>I was dumb, stupid, crazy, ♪</i>

11:45.239 --> 11:46.640
-Hey, Aaron.
-Hey, Pam.

11:46.740 --> 11:49.076
-You look nice.
-Thank you. So do you.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.611
Thank you.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.547
Hey.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.550
Hey.

11:56.650 --> 11:58.819
I accidentally took your keys
last night.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.254
My what?

12:00.354 --> 12:03.957
Keys.
Yeah, I thought they were mine.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.425
I have my keys.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.362
So, whose are these?

12:08.462 --> 12:10.831
I don't know.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.933
Okay, my bad.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.601
Where'd you find 'em?

12:14.701 --> 12:16.904
They were in your chair,
at your place.

12:17.004 --> 12:19.072
And mine were in my pocket,
last time I left.

12:19.173 --> 12:20.641
Let me see?

12:22.276 --> 12:23.710
Oh.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.680
Do you recognize them?

12:28.348 --> 12:30.551
Yeah...

12:30.651 --> 12:32.920
They are actually Zac's keys.

12:34.388 --> 12:37.124
Oh.
Okay.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.593
He must have forgot them
when he moved out,

12:39.693 --> 12:41.428
probably just fell
in the cushion, you know?

12:41.528 --> 12:43.630
[Aaron]: Right.
Yeah.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.699
That's ironic.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.100
I guess.

12:47.201 --> 12:50.003
I mean, I just, I thought you
might have been locked out.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.939
It's all good.
I appreciate it.

12:52.039 --> 12:55.776
Okay.
How's the day going?

12:57.211 --> 12:58.679
Good.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.814
I mean, just feeling
a little sluggish and sad,

13:00.914 --> 13:02.249
but getting stuff done.

13:02.349 --> 13:06.153
Yeah, I understand that.
That's all a part of it.

13:06.253 --> 13:08.689
Yeah, it is.
It has to be.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.529
Can I see you tonight?

13:15.629 --> 13:18.699
Yeah.
I'd like that.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.100
[Aaron]: Okay.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.969
I'll come by, like, 7:00.

13:22.069 --> 13:23.403
Okay.

13:23.504 --> 13:26.673
And I'll bring the pickles
and ice cream.

13:26.773 --> 13:29.610
Okay.
Pickles and ice cream.

13:29.710 --> 13:31.311
All right.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.247
-[Karen]: All right.
-I'll see you.

13:33.347 --> 13:34.748
Bye.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.783
Bye.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.788
-[Aaron]: Bye, Pam.
-[Pam]: Bye, Aaron.

13:49.096 --> 13:51.431
Girl, that man is fine!

13:53.200 --> 13:54.801
I know.

13:54.902 --> 13:57.037
Whew.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.640
Can you take these?

13:59.740 --> 14:00.841
What's this?

14:00.941 --> 14:03.710
Zac's keys, he left 'em.
Tell him to come get 'em.

14:03.810 --> 14:04.978
[Pam]: Zac?

14:05.078 --> 14:06.713
Yeah.

14:06.813 --> 14:09.149
And what was he doing
at your house?

14:09.249 --> 14:10.918
This was a long time ago,
okay?

14:11.018 --> 14:13.754
And he hasn't asked
for them in all this time?

14:13.854 --> 14:15.189
I guess not.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.057
Well, if he didn't,
he don't want 'em.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.760
Just call him and tell him
to come get 'em, okay?

14:19.860 --> 14:22.796
-I'll just send it to him.
-No.

14:26.733 --> 14:30.404
Oh. You want him
to come here?

14:30.504 --> 14:32.372
Can you just do as I say, Pam?

14:32.472 --> 14:36.009
Well, I will, as soon as
he get outta jail.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.578
What?
He's still in jail?

14:37.678 --> 14:40.147
-You know about it?
-Yeah.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.182
Oh. Well, what happened?

14:42.282 --> 14:43.517
He got into a fight.

14:43.617 --> 14:47.421
I know, with that lawyer,
over Fatima?

14:47.521 --> 14:49.356
Pam, you really gotta stop
asking questions that you

14:49.456 --> 14:51.558
already know the answers to.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.961
I had to see what you knew.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.529
Mama don't spill tea first.

14:55.629 --> 14:59.333
Well, there's only one
"mama" here, so...

14:59.433 --> 15:03.003
Go do some work.
Okay, "mama".

15:03.103 --> 15:04.505
Thank you.
You welcome.

15:04.605 --> 15:08.542
Oh, can you find out
when he gets out?

15:10.210 --> 15:12.379
Now, how would I do that?

15:12.479 --> 15:15.415
'Cause your name is Pam.

15:15.516 --> 15:17.784
Facts!
I'll see what I can do.

15:17.885 --> 15:19.520
Thank you.

15:21.455 --> 15:22.956

Mm-hm.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.686
-Hi.
-Hi.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.955
I thought I would
deliver these.

15:55.055 --> 15:58.125
Mm.
Look at you.

15:59.893 --> 16:01.795
How are you?

16:01.895 --> 16:03.697
I'm good.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.400
I love to hear that.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.302
I want to talk to you.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.270
Can you take a break?

16:10.370 --> 16:11.738
No.
I can't leave right now,

16:11.839 --> 16:14.708
but we can chat in my office?

16:14.808 --> 16:17.578
Okay.
Show me the way.

16:28.555 --> 16:31.525
-[Sabrina]: So?
-You look great.

16:31.625 --> 16:34.027
-Thank you.
-I love your style.

16:34.127 --> 16:37.164
Thank you, but I need
to talk to you something.

16:37.264 --> 16:38.832
What is it?

16:41.502 --> 16:44.872
Why didn't you tell me
you were a prince?

16:44.972 --> 16:46.473
How do you know?

16:46.573 --> 16:49.510
'Cause I met someone
from your country.

16:49.610 --> 16:51.512
There is no way.

16:51.612 --> 16:53.547
Mm-hm. Very much so.

16:53.647 --> 16:56.750
I met two young ladies.
Then they showed me this.

16:58.185 --> 17:01.755
Oh, wow.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.590
So?

17:03.690 --> 17:06.460
Yes, I am a prince.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.395
It is a very big deal
in my country,

17:08.495 --> 17:10.163
but it means nothing over here.

17:10.264 --> 17:12.032
Sometimes.

17:12.132 --> 17:15.035
I hope this does not
offend you.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.437
No, I just wish
I would have known.

17:17.538 --> 17:19.940
I am terribly sorry.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.809
It's okay,
I just wish I knew.

17:22.910 --> 17:25.679
Trust me,
it's a very small country.

17:25.779 --> 17:27.648
It's very important to
my mother and father,

17:27.748 --> 17:29.550
but they know I am
an independent man,

17:29.650 --> 17:32.486
and a thinker of my own.
Mm-hm.

17:32.586 --> 17:34.354
So, don't worry.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.190
You won't be harassed by people.

17:36.290 --> 17:38.592
I am not that well known
outside my country.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.930
I see.

17:43.030 --> 17:45.966
You say "I see",
but do you?

17:48.001 --> 17:49.636
I do.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.271
That's good to hear.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.275
Thank you for the flowers.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.010
You have to read the card.

18:07.287 --> 18:08.589
Yes.

18:08.689 --> 18:10.791
So, you will meet me
for dinner?

18:12.226 --> 18:15.028
And you will let me
send a car for you?

18:15.128 --> 18:16.396
No, I can drive!

18:16.496 --> 18:17.731
No, no.

18:17.831 --> 18:20.234
Either I pick you up,
or I send a driver.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.037
Fine.

18:24.137 --> 18:26.306
It is the proper way
to treat a princess.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.245
Well, thank you, Prince?

18:32.646 --> 18:34.214
Of course.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.884
Now if you will excuse me,
I know you have to get to work,

18:36.984 --> 18:38.952
and I have a camel to feed.

18:39.052 --> 18:40.487
What?

18:40.587 --> 18:43.123
It's just a joke.
I don't have camels.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.660
You're silly.

18:46.760 --> 18:49.863
I'll see you later,
beautiful woman.

18:53.267 --> 18:54.935
Okay.

18:56.537 --> 18:58.071
Bye.

18:58.172 --> 18:59.773
Bye.

19:02.009 --> 19:05.846
Hello.
[speaking foreign language]

19:12.152 --> 19:13.720
[Maurice]: Whew.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.959
Girl, there he go.

19:19.059 --> 19:21.562
And he brought you
more flowers.

19:21.662 --> 19:23.463
Mm-hm, he did.

19:23.564 --> 19:28.735
Again, why can't I get
somebody to bring me flowers?

19:28.836 --> 19:30.771
I'm sure you can.

19:30.871 --> 19:33.273
A good ol' African.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.209
Maurice, stop it.

19:35.309 --> 19:36.677
I'm just sayin'.

19:36.777 --> 19:39.880
And he got all that money,
and he like you.

19:39.980 --> 19:42.716
What the hell
could he see in you?

19:42.816 --> 19:43.984
You're jealous.

19:44.084 --> 19:45.252
Jealous?

19:45.352 --> 19:47.688
Darling, how could
I ever be jealous?

19:47.788 --> 19:49.389
Look.

19:49.489 --> 19:52.926
Get it.
Get jealous in the...

19:53.026 --> 19:55.495
You look good.
The face, the waist, the hip.

19:55.596 --> 19:59.399
Yeah.
Whatever, Maurice.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.869
And you don't want to know
how Calvin is doing?

20:01.969 --> 20:03.136
No.

20:03.237 --> 20:08.075
Oh, so I guess you still on
the mother land ship.

20:08.175 --> 20:10.577
Maurice!
Go, mind your business.

20:10.677 --> 20:11.945
I am, I am.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.614
And go take care of
those customers.

20:13.714 --> 20:17.050
I will,
but I must say.

20:17.150 --> 20:19.720
I like the way
you're switching it up, hoe.

20:19.820 --> 20:22.789
Do it, girl.
Do it, do it, honey.

20:22.890 --> 20:25.492
-Don't snap in my...
-Shut up, bitch.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.694
Close my door!

20:27.794 --> 20:30.030
I can help you.
How you doin'?

20:30.130 --> 20:31.899
My hair was that color once.

20:31.999 --> 20:33.767
They say blondes
have more fun!

20:33.867 --> 20:35.269
Over here...

20:52.286 --> 20:53.720
[Logan]: Hey.

20:56.056 --> 20:58.192
-Damn!
-What?

20:58.292 --> 20:59.860
I could hardly recognize you.

20:59.960 --> 21:03.197
Is that 'cause I don't
got my pimp outfit on?

21:03.297 --> 21:05.632
-Damn, Logan.
-See, you funny.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.568
Didn't know you were
such a hunk-a hunk-a.

21:07.668 --> 21:10.204
Hunk-a hunk-a?
Come on now, Danni.

21:10.304 --> 21:12.372
I'm serious.
Wow!

21:12.472 --> 21:14.374
Well, thank you.

21:14.474 --> 21:15.742
What you doing here?

21:15.843 --> 21:18.078
I was just debriefing
and wrapping out.

21:18.178 --> 21:19.780
Oh, so you won't be around?

21:19.880 --> 21:22.683
-No, I will be.
-[Danni]: Good.

21:22.783 --> 21:25.252
I mean, that is when
I get another assignment.

21:25.352 --> 21:27.988
Well, it'll be good
to see you until then.

21:28.088 --> 21:30.324
So, we're meeting for dinner?

21:30.424 --> 21:32.492
Yes, at the...

21:32.593 --> 21:34.995
-Olive.
-Olive.

21:35.095 --> 21:36.830
You're not gonna stand me up?

21:36.930 --> 21:38.198
No, I wouldn't have,

21:38.298 --> 21:40.300
if I had seen you
in your gingham.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.935
Now, are you objectifying
my body?

21:42.035 --> 21:43.537
One hundred percent.

21:43.637 --> 21:45.973
Okay.
Well, I'll see you at...

21:46.073 --> 21:47.274
Seven, yeah.
Seven.

21:47.374 --> 21:49.276
I'll leave here, get gussied up,

21:49.376 --> 21:50.777
and I'll head over.

21:50.878 --> 21:52.713
Okay.
Okay.

21:52.813 --> 21:54.348
Bye.
Bye.

21:54.448 --> 21:58.685
Walk slowly.
That's how I like it.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.420
Yeah, mm-hm.

22:25.946 --> 22:27.948
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:28.048 --> 22:29.316
Zac here?

22:29.416 --> 22:32.553
No.
I'm waitin' for his ass.

22:32.653 --> 22:35.289
-Well, what do you mean?
-He owes me money.

22:35.389 --> 22:38.325
I'm Will, the contractor,
I'm supposed to get paid today.

22:38.425 --> 22:39.760
All right.
Let me call him.

22:39.860 --> 22:41.628
No, no, no, no.
I've been callin' his ass,

22:41.728 --> 22:43.397
he ain't answering.

22:43.497 --> 22:44.698
All right,
I'll call his girlfriend.

22:44.798 --> 22:46.333
Girlfriend, boyfriend,
somebody gotta to pay me!

22:46.433 --> 22:47.434
Just hold on, all right?

22:47.534 --> 22:49.336
Yeah, no shit

22:49.436 --> 22:50.838
Wait, how much does
he owe you?

22:53.340 --> 22:54.808
He owes me $3,500.

22:54.908 --> 22:56.910
I gotta pay my guys, too.
I need that.

22:57.010 --> 22:58.145
Let me see the invoice.

22:59.746 --> 23:01.081
Here.

23:04.885 --> 23:06.253
All right.

23:06.353 --> 23:07.955
What are you doing?

23:08.055 --> 23:09.623
Just hold on one second.

23:12.860 --> 23:14.261
Here.

23:14.361 --> 23:16.263
Cash this,
I'll take the invoice.

23:16.363 --> 23:18.799
I'll settle it with Zac.

23:18.899 --> 23:20.434
This good?

23:20.534 --> 23:23.504
What do you think?

23:23.604 --> 23:25.606
This better not bounce.

23:29.042 --> 23:30.811
"Thank you" would've
been nice, asshole.

23:38.685 --> 23:40.721
Yeah, can I please speak
to Andi Barnes?

23:40.821 --> 23:43.490
This is Jake Bennett.
Thanks.

23:45.192 --> 23:47.094
[phone ringing]

23:47.194 --> 23:48.929
Oh, sh--.

23:52.599 --> 23:54.801
This is Andi.

23:54.902 --> 23:56.336
Hi, yes.
This is Jake Bennett.

23:56.436 --> 23:58.805
I work with Gary.

23:58.906 --> 24:00.741
Okay?

24:00.841 --> 24:02.142
Yeah, I was wonderin' if

24:02.242 --> 24:03.844
I could speak with
your assistant, Fatima.

24:03.944 --> 24:05.546
She's not here at the moment.

24:05.646 --> 24:07.648
Is there something
I can help you with?

24:07.748 --> 24:09.750
Well, actually,
I was looking for Zac.

24:11.818 --> 24:13.720
Why?

24:13.820 --> 24:15.522
I have been helping him
with his portfolio,

24:15.622 --> 24:17.491
and I haven't seen him
in a couple days.

24:17.591 --> 24:19.526
And you work with Gary?

24:19.626 --> 24:22.396
JAKE: Yes.

24:22.496 --> 24:24.898
And what do you do for Gary?

24:24.998 --> 24:26.867
I run the
Acquisitions Division.

24:29.069 --> 24:30.304
Hm.

24:32.472 --> 24:35.042
Do you have any idea
where he could be?

24:35.142 --> 24:36.877
<i>[Andi]: No, I don't.</i>

24:36.977 --> 24:40.214
Okay, yeah.
This, this is just not like him.

24:41.915 --> 24:46.186
How long have you known him,
to know what's not like him?

24:46.286 --> 24:47.955
Gary introduced us.

24:48.055 --> 24:50.224
<i>[Andi]: Mm-hm.</i>

24:50.324 --> 24:53.260
And how did they
know each other?

24:53.360 --> 24:57.197
We all play basketball together,
he asked me to help him out.

24:57.297 --> 24:59.166
Huh.
I see.

25:01.869 --> 25:04.938
So, is there any way
I can get Fatima's number?

25:06.440 --> 25:08.842
I will give her your number.

25:10.377 --> 25:13.046
Okay.
You wanna take it down?

25:14.648 --> 25:17.117
It shows up on
the office line.

25:19.319 --> 25:21.788
Okay.
Thank you.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.259
Uh-huh.

25:30.931 --> 25:32.699
What the hell is that about?

25:51.752 --> 25:53.287
-Hey.
-Hey.

25:53.387 --> 25:54.388
Preston, right?

25:54.488 --> 25:55.689
Yeah, how you doin'?

25:55.789 --> 25:58.258
Good.
You looking for Zac?

25:58.358 --> 26:00.260
Yeah, you too?

26:00.360 --> 26:02.563
Yeah, well, he's not here.

26:02.663 --> 26:04.064
I've been calling him.

26:04.164 --> 26:06.967
Yeah, I've been doin'
the same thing.

26:07.067 --> 26:08.435
Damn

26:08.535 --> 26:11.138
Do you have any idea
where he is?

26:11.238 --> 26:13.040
I have no idea.

26:13.140 --> 26:15.342
Is there anybody you can call
and find out?

26:18.679 --> 26:21.114
There's only one person.

26:21.215 --> 26:22.983
Could you?

26:23.083 --> 26:24.885
I really don't know
if I should.

26:24.985 --> 26:26.887
Come on, man.
I'm worried about him.

26:29.990 --> 26:31.425
All right.
I appreciate that.

26:31.525 --> 26:33.026
Okay.

26:47.674 --> 26:50.143
Well, look at the dead livin'.

26:52.246 --> 26:54.715
Have you seen Zac?

26:54.815 --> 26:57.784
You called me
to see where Zac is?

26:57.885 --> 27:01.655
What, am I Zac Whisperer, or?

27:01.755 --> 27:03.790
Danni, I'm serious.

27:03.891 --> 27:05.292
<i>[Danni]: What is it?</i>

27:05.392 --> 27:06.894
Have you seen Zac?

27:08.962 --> 27:11.698
Why, what do you need?
What's going on?

27:11.798 --> 27:13.767
I just want to talk to him.

27:15.135 --> 27:16.403
About me?

27:18.238 --> 27:20.274
No, not about you.

27:20.374 --> 27:21.875
<i>[Danni]: You lying.</i>

27:21.975 --> 27:23.944
Look, I'm standing here
with a friend of his,

27:24.044 --> 27:26.747
and we're trying to find him.

27:26.847 --> 27:29.983
Okay, well, I mean,
Zac's in jail!

27:30.083 --> 27:32.052
For what?

27:32.152 --> 27:34.755
Apparently he was fightin'
at Andi's office.

27:34.855 --> 27:36.557
At Andi's office?

27:36.657 --> 27:38.325
<i>[Danni]: Yes.</i>

27:38.425 --> 27:40.294
With someone named Hayden?

27:40.394 --> 27:42.296
So, yeah, he's in jail,

27:42.396 --> 27:45.599
If you're lookin' for
more bad advice,

27:45.699 --> 27:48.135
that's where it is,
where it belongs.

27:50.537 --> 27:52.673
Is anybody getting him out?

27:52.773 --> 27:54.041
Hell if I know.

27:54.141 --> 27:56.677
I'm sure Captain Fatima
is on it.

27:56.777 --> 27:59.246
Okay, so which jail
did they take him to?

27:59.346 --> 28:00.681
Okay, Preston?

28:00.781 --> 28:04.985
These are a lotta questions that
I don't have the answers to, so.

28:05.085 --> 28:07.788
Okay.
Thanks, Danni.

28:07.888 --> 28:10.958
All right.
So, that's it?

28:11.058 --> 28:13.861
Not gonna talk about
nothin' else?

28:13.961 --> 28:16.196
Yeah, that's it.

28:16.296 --> 28:17.998
<i>[Danni]: Okay.</i>

28:18.098 --> 28:19.466
Bye.

28:27.541 --> 28:28.942
What she say?

28:29.042 --> 28:31.578
-He's in jail.
-For what?

28:31.678 --> 28:34.681
He got into it with
somebody named Hayden somewhere.

28:34.781 --> 28:36.183
Aw, sh-- Hayden?

28:36.283 --> 28:38.452
-Yeah.
-All right, thanks.

28:38.552 --> 28:39.953
Wait, wait, wait,
look!

28:40.053 --> 28:43.590
Here.
Take my number.

28:43.690 --> 28:46.360
Call me if you need anything.

28:46.460 --> 28:48.195
All right.
Thank you.

28:48.295 --> 28:49.897
See you.

29:10.217 --> 29:12.186
Hi.

29:12.286 --> 29:14.087
Hey.

29:14.188 --> 29:16.223
I'm getting outta here.

29:16.323 --> 29:18.125
Okay.
Call you later?

29:19.560 --> 29:21.195
Yes, please.

29:23.997 --> 29:28.235
Oh, and your boy Zac should be
getting out in a little bit.

29:28.335 --> 29:31.238
-Really?
-Mm-hm, you owe me big time.

29:31.338 --> 29:33.373
Big time.
Thank you so much.

29:33.473 --> 29:35.075
[Robin]: Mm-hm.

29:36.577 --> 29:39.146
He's not gonna run, right?

29:39.246 --> 29:41.748
Zac?
No.

29:41.849 --> 29:46.920
Okay, well, I spoke with
my friend and her dad.

29:47.020 --> 29:49.656
And they talked with
his parole officer,

29:49.756 --> 29:52.125
and he was sayin' that
Zac is a role model.

29:52.226 --> 29:54.728
So, they're gonna let him out,

29:54.828 --> 29:57.564
but the assault charges
are gonna stand.

29:57.664 --> 30:00.234
So, he's gonna have to
deal with that.

30:00.334 --> 30:01.902
That's understandable.

30:02.002 --> 30:04.771
[Robin]: Okay.
You gonna go let 'em know?

30:04.872 --> 30:06.673
Yeah.
[Robin]: All right.

30:06.773 --> 30:07.941
Okay.

30:08.041 --> 30:11.178
Andi, you know,
it's so good to see you.

30:11.278 --> 30:13.180
It was good seeing you, too.

30:13.280 --> 30:15.282
Okay.

30:15.382 --> 30:17.084
I'll see you when I get back.

30:17.184 --> 30:18.619
I'll see you then.

30:28.562 --> 30:29.463
<i>[Fatima]: Hello?</i>

30:29.563 --> 30:32.065
Hey, where are you?

30:32.165 --> 30:33.700
<i>[Fatima]: At home.</i>

30:33.800 --> 30:34.735
Okay.

30:34.835 --> 30:37.404
Robin was able to get Zac out.

30:37.504 --> 30:39.273
How soon can you
be at the jail?

30:39.373 --> 30:41.775
<i>[Fatima]: In two seconds.</i>

30:41.875 --> 30:43.677
I'm serious.

30:43.777 --> 30:46.213
<i>[Fatima]: I'm outside</i>
<i>of the jail.</i>

30:46.313 --> 30:48.615
You just said you were
at home.

30:48.715 --> 30:49.983
<i>[Fatima]: I know, I'm sorry.</i>

30:50.083 --> 30:52.119
<i>I didn't want you to</i>
<i>think I'm desperate,</i>

30:52.219 --> 30:53.654
waiting by the door for my man.

30:53.754 --> 30:55.556
And that's exactly
what you're doing.

30:55.656 --> 30:57.191
<i>[Fatima]: Girl, I'm here.</i>
<i>Hurry up.</i>

30:57.291 --> 30:58.926
Okay, okay.
Bye.

31:02.663 --> 31:04.798
I forgot to tell you.

31:04.898 --> 31:07.668
Hayden has gotten access to
a federal data base.

31:09.603 --> 31:12.372
Why?
I don't know.

31:12.472 --> 31:15.242
But he's been looking at footage
from the airport for hours.

31:16.944 --> 31:19.780
I don't understand.
For a client, or?

31:19.880 --> 31:21.982
I don't know,
and I don't want to ask,

31:22.082 --> 31:23.717
because I'm sure
he's up to something.

31:25.819 --> 31:27.988
Knowing him,
he probably is.

31:29.857 --> 31:32.693
Well, I just wanted to
give you a heads up.

31:32.793 --> 31:34.161
Well, I appreciate that.
Thank you.

31:34.261 --> 31:35.562
[Robin]: Yeah.

31:35.662 --> 31:37.898
Don't tell a soul
about this, okay?

31:37.998 --> 31:39.499
I won't.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.969
All right.
We're looking into him,

31:42.069 --> 31:43.637
The back portal,
tracing his steps,

31:43.737 --> 31:45.572
and he's being audited.

31:47.374 --> 31:50.377
Do you think it's
something illegal?

31:50.477 --> 31:54.281
Shit, I hope so.
I don't like his ass.

31:54.381 --> 31:55.782
Join the club.

31:57.885 --> 32:01.488
All right, well, I will let you
know what he's up to.

32:01.588 --> 32:03.156
-Thank you.
-[Robin]: Mm-hm.

32:04.758 --> 32:06.760
I'm gonna miss you.

32:06.860 --> 32:08.629
I'm gonna miss you more.

32:16.436 --> 32:18.038
You gotta go, girl.
Come on!

32:38.025 --> 32:39.626
Hey.

32:39.726 --> 32:41.128
Hey, what's goin'.

32:44.331 --> 32:46.733
You called.
What's goin' on?

32:46.834 --> 32:49.336
I'm so damn stupid.

32:49.436 --> 32:51.705
What is it?

32:51.805 --> 32:54.341
I bought her that apartment.

32:54.441 --> 32:55.776
All right.
Gary, talk to me.

32:55.876 --> 32:57.544
Andi, I bought her
that apartment,

32:57.644 --> 33:00.180
she's in there
having sex with that dude.

33:03.517 --> 33:04.518
How do you know that?

33:04.618 --> 33:06.186
I just know, okay?

33:07.554 --> 33:09.089
Gary, how do you know that?

33:15.896 --> 33:17.698
How do you know that?

33:17.798 --> 33:19.266
I can see through
the telescope.

33:32.412 --> 33:35.582
Shit...
Man, this is not good.

33:35.682 --> 33:37.084
I know, okay?
But...

33:37.184 --> 33:40.320
-Gary, what are you doin'?
-I bought her that place.

33:40.420 --> 33:42.055
And you told her it was hers?

33:43.991 --> 33:45.926
-Yeah, I did.
-All right, well, if it's hers,

33:46.026 --> 33:49.062
she can have whoever she
wants over there.

33:49.162 --> 33:51.331
Okay.

33:51.431 --> 33:54.168
And she did,
and you're mad?

33:54.268 --> 33:56.136
I just...
I thought...

33:56.236 --> 33:58.272
You just thought what?

33:58.372 --> 34:01.241
That it would make her love you?

34:01.341 --> 34:04.178
I thought that if
I got her the place,

34:04.278 --> 34:07.314
then it would make her
want to be with me.

34:07.414 --> 34:09.983
I mean, how can she be in
that place with that dude, huh?

34:10.083 --> 34:12.452
And not even think about me.
How can she do that to me?

34:14.721 --> 34:19.526
Gary, you took all the stuff
out of her place,

34:19.626 --> 34:20.928
without asking her
about it, okay?

34:21.028 --> 34:23.030
You told her it was hers,
she can do whatever

34:23.130 --> 34:25.199
she wants with it.
You told her all these things.

34:25.299 --> 34:26.533
Okay, I know.

34:26.633 --> 34:28.769
Look, you just asked.
I'm just telling you the truth.

34:28.869 --> 34:30.771
Okay, so what?
You want me to calm down?

34:30.871 --> 34:32.105
-[Aaron]: Yes.
-Okay.

34:32.206 --> 34:34.007
-[Aaron]: Calm down.
-Okay, I'm calm.

34:36.743 --> 34:38.178
What are you gonna do?

34:40.714 --> 34:43.217
I don't know.

34:43.317 --> 34:46.386
All right, well,
before you do anything,

34:46.486 --> 34:48.055
or even say anything,

34:48.155 --> 34:49.690
just make sure you are
completely calm.

34:49.790 --> 34:52.326
All right?

34:52.426 --> 34:54.228
-- that, we need to talk.
No, Gary. Come on.

34:54.328 --> 34:55.662
No, I'm gonna
talk to her, all right?

34:55.762 --> 34:57.531
I'm not letting you talk to her
until I'm sure you're calm.

34:57.631 --> 34:58.765
I bought her the place!

34:58.866 --> 35:02.069
-I understand that.
-And she does this to me?

35:02.169 --> 35:03.737
Come on, man.
No, no, no, no.

35:03.837 --> 35:05.372
No, no, no, no.

35:05.472 --> 35:07.441
We're gonna talk, all right?

35:07.541 --> 35:08.976
Well, you know what...

35:09.076 --> 35:11.011
Okay, so, first things first,
we're getting rid of this.

35:11.111 --> 35:12.946
-For sure.
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

35:13.046 --> 35:14.414
Okay, yeah, no.
This is happening!

35:14.515 --> 35:16.650
-I, I need that.
-No, you don't need that, okay?

35:16.750 --> 35:18.185
Stop.

35:23.457 --> 35:27.027
Now, you're not going to
talk to her until you calm down.

35:30.097 --> 35:34.468
I'm calm.
I hear you.

35:34.568 --> 35:35.802
Now, I know that you hear me,

35:35.903 --> 35:38.772
but that's what
we're going to do. You got me?

35:40.641 --> 35:43.210
Yeah.

35:43.310 --> 35:44.845
All right.

36:02.095 --> 36:04.698
-Hey.
-Hey, any update?

36:04.798 --> 36:07.467
They said that he
should be out any moment now.

36:07.568 --> 36:09.169
All right.
Thank you.

36:09.269 --> 36:10.838
Mm-hm.
It's no problem.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.441
You don't have to stay.

36:14.541 --> 36:16.543
Are you sure?
Yeah, yeah.

36:18.412 --> 36:19.780
Okay.

36:19.880 --> 36:24.551
Are you two, Bonnie and Clyde,
gonna behave, or?

36:24.651 --> 36:27.054
We're good.
We're good.

36:27.154 --> 36:28.755
Okay, all right.
I'm going to go.

36:28.856 --> 36:32.192
Oh, tell Robin thank you
as well, please.

36:32.292 --> 36:33.493
-Okay.
-All right.

36:33.594 --> 36:36.463
-I will.
-All right. Thank you.

36:36.563 --> 36:40.634
What's that little smile for?

36:40.734 --> 36:43.904
That smile is,
that I will tell him.

36:44.004 --> 36:45.806
Ah, shit.

36:45.906 --> 36:47.508
Stop.

36:47.608 --> 36:50.511
So, are you gonna
see him later?

36:50.611 --> 36:52.312
If I want to.

36:52.412 --> 36:55.716
Okay, well, you know Gary
bought that place.

36:55.816 --> 36:58.318
Yeah, and I think this
will be the true test

36:58.418 --> 37:01.355
if it's really my place.
Right?

37:01.455 --> 37:04.892
So, you really gonna
invite him over?

37:04.992 --> 37:06.793
I damn sure am.

37:06.894 --> 37:10.030
All right.
Well, be careful.

37:10.130 --> 37:12.466
I will.
I got this.

37:12.566 --> 37:15.402
All right, well, call me
if you need backup.

37:15.502 --> 37:17.504
-No, I'm not gonna do that.
-I'm joking.

37:17.604 --> 37:19.640
-Not gonna call you.
-I'm gonna chill for a minute.

37:19.740 --> 37:22.142
Oh!
Here you are.

37:23.911 --> 37:25.412
Thank you.

37:25.512 --> 37:26.914
You're welcome.

37:28.715 --> 37:30.984
Well, I'm gonna leave
you two to it.

37:31.084 --> 37:33.287
-All right. Thank you, Andi.
-No problem. Bye.

37:33.387 --> 37:35.122
-Later
-I'll see you.

37:36.657 --> 37:38.825
Hey, you.
What's up?

37:38.926 --> 37:40.160
My baby.

37:40.260 --> 37:42.896
What's up, jailbird?

37:42.996 --> 37:45.933
You know what they say.
Birds of a feather...

37:46.033 --> 37:47.367
I know.

37:47.467 --> 37:48.802
You okay?

37:48.902 --> 37:51.338
I'm good. I'm good,
now that I got you.

37:51.438 --> 37:53.340
Babe, I feel terrible
about all this.

37:53.440 --> 37:54.741
Why?
About what?

37:54.842 --> 37:56.510
'Cause if I hadn't went
after him...

37:56.610 --> 37:58.011
No, you did that for me.

37:58.111 --> 38:00.247
No, but then you
wouldn't have went after him.

38:00.347 --> 38:02.850
And I did that for you.

38:02.950 --> 38:03.617
Damn.

38:03.717 --> 38:05.018
You know what they say!

38:05.118 --> 38:07.187
Birds of a feather,
go to jail together.

38:09.156 --> 38:10.324
You crazy, I love you.

38:10.424 --> 38:13.460
I love you, too.

38:13.560 --> 38:15.829
-Come on.
-Where we goin'?

38:15.929 --> 38:18.265
The man ruined my surprise.

38:18.365 --> 38:20.000
What surprise?

38:20.100 --> 38:21.335
I'ma show you.

38:21.435 --> 38:22.769
And I'm drivin',
where the keys?

38:22.870 --> 38:25.172
Okay, I'm surprised,
and I love when you drive!

38:28.375 --> 38:34.314
[music]

38:41.588 --> 38:43.590
Flight manifest...

38:46.193 --> 38:47.661
Uh-huh.

38:49.429 --> 38:51.698
There it is.

38:51.798 --> 38:54.134
Now, let me see...

38:54.234 --> 38:55.836
Airport video.

38:59.740 --> 39:01.842
Now, what are you doin'
on this flight?

39:05.179 --> 39:06.380
Wow.

39:08.015 --> 39:09.816
What are y'all talkin' about?

39:19.059 --> 39:20.928
Why is this -- comin' back?

39:26.066 --> 39:27.901
Wow.

39:28.001 --> 39:30.437
That's how you did this shit.

39:30.537 --> 39:34.074
She's a senator's wife,
and she told you.

39:34.174 --> 39:35.976
Hm.

39:36.076 --> 39:38.078
I got you now,
you little bitch.

39:44.751 --> 39:45.986
I'm -- pissed, man!

39:46.086 --> 39:47.387
So, what are you going to do?

39:47.487 --> 39:49.256
I want my money,
and I want my place back.

39:49.356 --> 39:50.591
[Danni]: Next, on "Sistas".

39:50.691 --> 39:52.292
[Andi]: Hayden's scouring
airport footage.

39:52.392 --> 39:53.827
And apparently,
he's onto something.

39:53.927 --> 39:55.229
I think I really screwed up.

39:55.329 --> 39:56.897
I was listening to
some bad advice,

39:56.997 --> 39:58.565
and now I think Danni's over me.

39:58.665 --> 40:00.167
When is he gonna take
responsibility for

40:00.267 --> 40:01.568
his own learning?

40:01.668 --> 40:03.036
If you wanna date Black women,

40:03.136 --> 40:04.304
you gotta go out there
and learn yourself.

40:04.404 --> 40:06.006
If you want,
we could talk about a side deal.

40:06.106 --> 40:07.441
'Cause I don't -- with Gary.

40:07.541 --> 40:08.876
All I can say,
is I've been watchin' him.

40:08.976 --> 40:10.444
With money?

40:10.544 --> 40:13.213
The apartments, the gifts,
the car, all of that stuff...

40:13.313 --> 40:14.348
That was for us!
