01:31.107 --> 01:32.438
Keep it straight!

01:34.244 --> 01:36.439
Come on, straight.

02:16.119 --> 02:17.416
Give him room!

02:17.587 --> 02:20.750
Hold the line, gentlemen!
Look left! Look right!

02:20.924 --> 02:22.653
Hold the line!

02:26.863 --> 02:29.457
It's here. It's here.

02:31.467 --> 02:33.765
Hey, calm down, Buddy. Hey.

02:48.785 --> 02:50.878
Let him go. Let him go. Let him go.

03:20.717 --> 03:23.447
Let him go. Let him go.

03:39.235 --> 03:41.999
Easy, easy. Let him go!
Let him go, let him go.

03:47.243 --> 03:50.542
Here. Here, it's here.

03:52.048 --> 03:54.346
- It's here!
- Back up. Give him some room.

04:25.581 --> 04:27.412
<i>I've gone over the charts you've sent...</i>

04:27.583 --> 04:31.349
<i>... and consulted another pediatric</i>
<i>neurologist who works with me here.</i>

04:33.056 --> 04:36.116
- <i>We're alarmed by two things.</i>
- Deficiency in lipid metabolism...

04:36.292 --> 04:39.728
...and diminished enzyme output.
- <i>Right. That's exactly right.</i>

04:40.029 --> 04:42.930
Both indicate
lysosomal storage illness.

04:43.099 --> 04:46.034
<i>You're the boy's</i>
<i>primary physician, Dr?</i>

04:46.369 --> 04:48.701
Scully. Dana Scully.

04:49.005 --> 04:51.132
<i>You tested his lysosome function?</i>

04:51.374 --> 04:54.741
I think you have
all my results there, doctor.

04:54.911 --> 04:57.903
My fear is that it's a type-two,
degenerative brain disease...

04:58.081 --> 04:59.446
...like Sandhoff disease...

04:59.615 --> 05:03.244
...that his enzymes aren't clearing lipids
from his brain, causing atrophy.

05:03.419 --> 05:08.118
<i>If you suspect Sandhoff disease, I'd test</i>
<i>the boy's levels of hexosaminidase.</i>

05:08.291 --> 05:11.385
I've done that.
What I'm looking for here, doctor...

05:11.561 --> 05:13.222
...is a course of treatment.

05:13.629 --> 05:16.223
<i>There is no treatment for Sandhoff.</i>

05:17.600 --> 05:20.535
<i>But if there were,</i>
<i>I'm sure you'd tell me.</i>

05:46.929 --> 05:48.863
Hi, Christian. How are you feeling?

05:49.065 --> 05:51.761
Okay, Dr. Scully. How are you?

05:51.934 --> 05:54.994
Me? Well, I'm doing just fine,
thank you.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.867
You got some outside opinions?

06:00.877 --> 06:04.142
Yes. We're gonna do some more tests.

06:04.981 --> 06:06.676
Dana Scully?

06:07.583 --> 06:09.710
Dr. Scully, I'm looking for Fox Mulder.

06:10.987 --> 06:12.614
Excuse me.

06:15.291 --> 06:18.317
- Special Agent Drummy with...
- I can guess who you're with.

06:18.494 --> 06:20.985
The FBI urgently needs to speak
with Fox Mulder.

06:21.164 --> 06:24.463
I don't work with Fox Mulder any longer.
I don't work with the FBI.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.397
Well, if you could contact him...

06:26.602 --> 06:29.230
...it might just save the life
of an FBI agent.

07:23.593 --> 07:25.288
What's up, doc?

07:25.561 --> 07:28.052
You've become awfully trusting,
Mulder...

07:28.231 --> 07:30.756
...for a man wanted by the FBI.

07:30.933 --> 07:33.094
Eyes in the back of my head, Scully.

07:33.269 --> 07:35.931
<i>"Auf einer Wellenl√§nge,"</i>
as the Germans say.

07:36.105 --> 07:38.972
It's a precognitive state
often confused with intuition...

07:39.175 --> 07:41.405
...in which the brain perceives
deep logic...

07:41.577 --> 07:45.138
...underlying transitory human existence
unaided by the conscious mind...

07:45.314 --> 07:47.714
...materializing much as you did
just now.

07:47.950 --> 07:52.944
Though if you'd actually materialized,
you'd be rapidly dematerializing.

07:53.589 --> 07:55.716
But who believes that crap anymore?

07:58.895 --> 08:02.854
Well, they do at the FBI, apparently.
I had a visitor today, Mulder.

08:05.468 --> 08:08.130
The FBI wants your help
finding a missing agent.

08:08.304 --> 08:10.272
I hope you told them
to screw themselves.

08:10.439 --> 08:12.600
They say all is forgiven.

08:12.775 --> 08:16.734
That they'll drop all charges against you
if you come in and help them solve this.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.676
The FBI will forgive me?

08:18.848 --> 08:22.614
They put me on trial on bogus charges
and tried to discredit a decade of work.

08:22.785 --> 08:24.776
They should be asking
for my forgiveness.

08:24.954 --> 08:27.354
I think they are. Desperately.

08:28.024 --> 08:30.492
How can I possibly help these people?

08:30.660 --> 08:34.494
Someone's come forward
with some promising evidence.

08:34.664 --> 08:37.758
A psychic, he claims.

08:39.434 --> 08:42.029
It's a trick, Scully, to smoke me out.

08:42.238 --> 08:45.537
If the FBI wanted to get you,
I have no doubt that they could.

08:45.741 --> 08:48.437
I think they've been happy
to have you out of their hair.

08:48.611 --> 08:51.307
Good. I am just as happy
having them out of mine.

08:51.480 --> 08:54.278
A young agent's life is at stake.

08:56.118 --> 08:59.952
Mulder, I know I don't have to say this,
but it could have been you once.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.817
Or me.

09:01.991 --> 09:06.655
You know, the truth is,
I worry about you...

09:06.829 --> 09:09.559
...and the effects
of long-term isolation.

09:11.567 --> 09:13.558
I'm fine here.

09:15.204 --> 09:17.035
I'm happy as a clam.

09:33.356 --> 09:35.324
I'll tell them your answer.

09:49.538 --> 09:51.096
Shit.

09:54.410 --> 09:55.434
Okay, I'll go.

09:57.113 --> 09:59.081
Under one condition.

11:13.122 --> 11:14.987
Thanks for the lift.

11:15.157 --> 11:18.820
Don't thank me. I didn't send it.

11:39.648 --> 11:41.275
Wait here.

12:07.676 --> 12:09.234
Come in.

12:19.221 --> 12:20.688
Excuse me. They're here.

12:25.394 --> 12:28.761
Thanks for making this happen.
I'm Special Agent in Charge Whitney.

12:28.964 --> 12:31.990
- Dana Scully.
- Fox Mulder, I believe?

12:32.168 --> 12:36.332
I know this is awkward. Welcome back.
My team and I appreciate your trust.

12:36.505 --> 12:39.668
Well, trust being what it is,
what if I can't help you?

12:40.009 --> 12:42.000
Or your agent turns up dead?

12:42.511 --> 12:44.172
The past is the past.

12:44.346 --> 12:46.109
I know your work on X-Files cases...

12:46.282 --> 12:49.718
...and believe you may be the best
chance Monica Bannan has now.

12:49.885 --> 12:53.116
- How long has she been missing?
- Since Sunday evening.

12:53.289 --> 12:55.257
Almost three days.

12:55.558 --> 12:57.583
I know you know this,
but after 72 hours...

12:57.760 --> 13:02.129
...there's slim chance she's still alive.
- We have slim reason to believe she is.

13:02.298 --> 13:04.630
So far, we've got no evidence
to the contrary...

13:04.800 --> 13:06.734
...and the facts give us hope.

13:06.902 --> 13:10.531
Soon after she goes missing,
we find this: a severed arm.

13:12.741 --> 13:15.107
- Where?
- About 10 miles from her home.

13:15.277 --> 13:17.575
I don't understand. It's a man's arm.

13:17.746 --> 13:21.705
Is it a match for evidence found at
or near the crime scene? Blood or tissue?

13:21.884 --> 13:25.149
Blood. Found in her garage
and on the tool that matches the wound.

13:25.321 --> 13:27.949
- You were led to it?
- Like a needle in a haystack.

13:28.123 --> 13:30.114
By someone claiming psychic powers.

13:30.292 --> 13:32.260
Joseph Fitzpatrick Crissman.

13:32.428 --> 13:35.591
- And you think he's full of shit.
- What makes you say that?

13:35.764 --> 13:37.561
Psychic.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.633
- Father Joe was...
- Father?

13:40.102 --> 13:42.297
- He was a priest?
- Catholic.

13:42.805 --> 13:46.241
He cold-called six hours after
Monica Bannan was reported missing...

13:46.408 --> 13:49.775
...claiming a vision of her.
A psychic connection.

13:49.945 --> 13:52.812
- And he tells you she's alive?
- That's right.

13:52.982 --> 13:54.779
Have you found any other connection?

13:54.950 --> 13:58.010
- To Monica Bannan?
- No. That's why I sent for you.

13:58.187 --> 14:01.350
- I need to know we're not wasting time.
- Well...

14:01.557 --> 14:04.651
...he's a religious man, clearly.
Educated man.

14:04.827 --> 14:07.921
He took right action, said nothing
to cast doubt upon himself...

14:08.097 --> 14:10.793
...has no connection to the crime.
You're wasting time...

14:10.966 --> 14:12.695
...only it's mine and your agents'.

14:12.868 --> 14:14.529
There's a question of credibility.

14:14.703 --> 14:17.536
If no reason to doubt the man,
why doubt the man's visions?

14:17.706 --> 14:21.472
He didn't lead us to Monica Bannan. He
gave us a guy's bloody arm in the snow.

14:21.644 --> 14:25.842
This is not an exact science. If it
were me, I would be on the guy 24/7.

14:26.015 --> 14:28.813
I'd be in bed with him,
kissing his holy ass.

14:31.987 --> 14:34.478
Father Joe's a convicted pedophile.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.992
Maybe I'd stay out of bed with him.

14:55.411 --> 14:57.311
What is this?

14:57.479 --> 15:01.006
- Dorms for habitual sex offenders.
- Dorms?

15:01.183 --> 15:04.346
They manage the complex
and police themselves.

15:04.520 --> 15:07.978
Father Joe lives here voluntarily
with his roommate.

15:09.358 --> 15:12.191
Just avoid the activities room.

15:24.773 --> 15:26.365
Joe?

15:27.076 --> 15:29.340
Tell them to come in.

15:44.059 --> 15:45.720
Father Joe?

15:51.400 --> 15:54.164
Excuse the mess.
I haven't been sleeping.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.199
Father Joe, this is Fox Mulder.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.467
- Okay.
- He'd like to ask some questions.

16:00.676 --> 16:03.270
Actually, I'd like to ask something.

16:03.912 --> 16:06.540
What was it you were praying for
in there, sir?

16:06.715 --> 16:10.742
- For the salvation of my immortal soul.
- Do you think God hears your prayers?

16:10.919 --> 16:14.480
- Do you think he hears yours?
- I didn't bugger 37 altar boys.

16:17.226 --> 16:20.252
- That's a colorful way of putting it.
- I have another word.

16:20.429 --> 16:22.124
I'm sure you do.

16:22.297 --> 16:26.563
I have to believe he does hear me,
or why would he send these visions?

16:26.902 --> 16:28.995
Maybe it's not God doing the sending.

16:29.838 --> 16:32.636
You call them visions. You see them?

16:32.808 --> 16:35.504
In what you might call my mind's eye.

16:35.711 --> 16:37.008
What do you see?

16:49.958 --> 16:52.620
I see the poor girl being assaulted.

16:54.596 --> 16:56.791
I see her putting up a fight.

16:57.466 --> 17:00.833
- I hear dogs barking.
- Where?

17:01.003 --> 17:02.493
Can't tell.

17:02.671 --> 17:06.505
- But you see her alive.
- No, but I...

17:06.675 --> 17:08.369
I feel that she is.

17:10.612 --> 17:13.604
Can you show us how you do it?

17:26.694 --> 17:29.186
I don't know
that I can do this right now.

17:32.401 --> 17:35.063
Maybe it'd be better
if she wasn't here.

17:36.672 --> 17:39.641
Maybe what you see is a way
to try and make people forget...

17:39.808 --> 17:41.901
...what it is that you really are.

18:08.604 --> 18:10.834
Jesus, Mulder.

18:13.675 --> 18:16.235
So much for kissing his holy ass.

18:16.845 --> 18:18.335
I'm sorry.

18:19.815 --> 18:23.751
I've been too long away from
this business. Or not long enough.

18:23.919 --> 18:25.614
No, you were good in there.

18:26.522 --> 18:30.117
All I had were questions.
But you pushed him, you challenged him.

18:30.325 --> 18:32.316
Like old times.

18:34.062 --> 18:36.462
Yeah, well, he's a creep. And a liar.

18:36.632 --> 18:39.897
He knows who did this.
They're supplying him with information.

18:40.068 --> 18:43.196
Look where he lives.
And this arm they found?

18:43.372 --> 18:48.275
This wasn't severed in any fight.
It was cut cleanly, chopped off.

18:48.443 --> 18:51.378
And tell me how he's been able
to lead them straight to it...

18:51.547 --> 18:54.744
...and not even muster a guess
as to where the victim is.

18:54.917 --> 18:57.283
Two things you're gonna find
in the next 24 hours:

18:57.452 --> 19:01.912
A dead agent, and that this guy,
Father Joe, is a big, fat fraud.

19:02.090 --> 19:04.422
You could be right, Scully.

19:04.593 --> 19:06.993
You could be right.

19:07.162 --> 19:09.130
But what if you're wrong?

19:16.271 --> 19:18.569
- What are you doing?
- Gonna take him for a ride.

19:18.740 --> 19:21.072
See just how psychic
this Father Joe really is.

19:24.279 --> 19:27.680
Yeah, well, it's been fun.

19:27.883 --> 19:30.443
Scully? Nobody's gonna make you
sit next to him.

19:30.619 --> 19:35.113
Thanks, but I've already been taken for a
ride. Anyway, he doesn't want me there.

19:37.759 --> 19:40.785
- I want you here.
- This isn't my life anymore, Mulder.

19:40.963 --> 19:43.261
I'm done chasing monsters in the dark.

19:43.432 --> 19:46.333
I think you've done all
they've asked of you here too.

19:46.668 --> 19:49.466
You know,
no one says you have to stay here.

19:50.906 --> 19:52.635
These people need my help.

19:54.176 --> 19:55.837
And I could really use yours.

20:23.372 --> 20:26.432
- Are we getting warm?
- You tell us.

20:28.510 --> 20:31.240
I don't know
I have a clue of where we are.

20:31.513 --> 20:34.971
That's all right.
Everybody works differently.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.179
Who are you, the good cop?

20:37.986 --> 20:39.851
I'm the non-cop.

20:44.259 --> 20:48.025
I don't know this girl.
This Agent Bannan of yours.

20:48.196 --> 20:49.857
I haven't a clue of the connection.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.563
There's always something,
however small.

20:55.103 --> 20:56.661
And who made you the expert?

20:58.573 --> 21:01.098
I once investigated a series of cases...

21:01.276 --> 21:04.507
...involving unexplained phenomena
for the FBI.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.376
So you believe in these sort of things?

21:08.550 --> 21:10.541
Let's just say I wanna believe.

21:11.219 --> 21:14.518
And his sister was abducted by E.T.

21:15.557 --> 21:16.615
Is that true?

21:18.126 --> 21:20.026
It was a long time ago.

21:21.863 --> 21:24.229
She's dead...

21:24.399 --> 21:26.060
...isn't she? Your sister.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.652
This is where she was taken.

21:44.820 --> 21:48.119
Your agent.
This is where she was attacked.

21:48.890 --> 21:51.085
I want him to see the crime scene.

22:14.850 --> 22:16.181
No, it's...

22:16.651 --> 22:18.050
This isn't right.

22:19.254 --> 22:21.814
You've brought me
to the wrong house.

22:29.064 --> 22:31.430
Pulled that right out of his ass.

22:57.092 --> 22:59.026
There were news crews
covering the scene.

22:59.194 --> 23:02.322
Pictures of the neighborhood.
He could've recognized it from TV.

23:02.497 --> 23:04.795
Yeah, but...? But why?

23:04.966 --> 23:06.331
- Why?
- Why do it?

23:06.501 --> 23:09.129
Why go to great lengths
to create an elaborate fiction?

23:09.304 --> 23:11.295
Expiation. Forgiveness of his sins.

23:11.473 --> 23:14.806
He's written dozens of letters
to the Vatican, pleading reengagement.

23:15.043 --> 23:17.477
Rather odd way
to impress the Holy See.

23:18.180 --> 23:21.672
Voice of God speaking through a man?
That's been a winner a few times.

23:21.883 --> 23:25.319
- So you think he's guilty too, huh?
- We have to consider him a suspect.

23:25.487 --> 23:27.352
You've found no connection
to the crime.

23:27.522 --> 23:30.514
Don't think my guys stopped.
They think they're gonna find one.

23:30.692 --> 23:32.717
Yeah, but you don't
or I wouldn't be here.

23:32.894 --> 23:37.092
I'm not the most popular girl at the FBI
right now for calling you in. Believe me.

23:37.265 --> 23:40.701
I wasn't exactly Miss Popularity
at the FBI myself.

23:41.002 --> 23:43.903
But you've dealt with psychics before.

23:44.072 --> 23:46.540
Luther Lee Boggs, Clyde Bruckman,
Gerald Schnauz.

23:46.708 --> 23:50.371
I went through those cases,
and that work was extremely impressive.

23:51.279 --> 23:54.248
Yeah, well, I'm only half the team.

23:54.749 --> 23:56.341
But it's your insights I need.

24:07.362 --> 24:10.593
She ran away. She tried to escape.

24:10.765 --> 24:14.428
There were two men. Well, she couldn't.
He pushed her down.

24:14.603 --> 24:16.400
It was here. It was right here.

24:16.571 --> 24:18.869
And then they put her in the back.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.440
- Where?
- In the car. No.

24:21.610 --> 24:25.046
- It was a truck with something on it.
- We have to find her!

24:25.213 --> 24:27.408
She's in pain. Great, great pain.

24:27.582 --> 24:29.812
- Tell me where.
- I don't know. I can't see.

24:29.985 --> 24:32.886
- We need to find her.
- I can't see. I can't see.

24:38.393 --> 24:40.953
Because he's pulling it out of his ass.

24:53.708 --> 24:55.266
Father Joe?

25:07.422 --> 25:08.446
Hi, Christian.

25:09.257 --> 25:11.919
You're looking very
bright-eyed this morning.

25:12.093 --> 25:15.426
- I was thinking.
- Yeah? What were you thinking?

25:15.864 --> 25:18.298
How I'm going to get out of here.

25:20.302 --> 25:23.169
Well, you know,
I'm thinking exactly the same thing.

25:23.338 --> 25:25.966
Can I get out of here soon?

25:27.509 --> 25:30.376
What's wrong?
Has something scared you?

25:30.545 --> 25:34.811
The way the man is looking at me.

25:34.983 --> 25:36.007
What man?

25:44.159 --> 25:45.888
Don't be afraid.

25:54.469 --> 25:56.562
I was just looking for those.

25:56.771 --> 25:58.398
I wanted to go over them myself...

25:58.573 --> 26:01.064
...and the results of the new tests
that you ordered.

26:01.276 --> 26:05.042
That isn't really your purview, Father.
It's his primary physician's.

26:05.347 --> 26:06.575
It is in my purview...

26:06.781 --> 26:10.046
...to make sure all my physicians
are making the right choices...

26:10.218 --> 26:12.243
...for their patients
and for the hospital.

26:12.420 --> 26:14.980
Can I have the test results, please?

26:16.725 --> 26:21.560
We are here to heal the sick,
not prolong the ordeal of the dying.

26:22.197 --> 26:25.496
There are other,
better facilities for the boy.

28:13.208 --> 28:14.402
Hey, hey. Hey!

29:06.027 --> 29:07.858
I'm okay.

29:08.029 --> 29:09.656
I'm fine.

29:42.897 --> 29:45.297
I can feel you thinking.

29:46.734 --> 29:49.760
I'm sorry. I can't sleep.

29:53.208 --> 29:56.371
Actually, I have a little something
for that.

29:58.913 --> 30:01.814
- Just a little something?
- Thank you.

30:03.251 --> 30:05.082
What's the matter?

30:09.157 --> 30:13.924
I have a patient, a young boy
with a rare brain disease.

30:14.095 --> 30:16.325
He's very, very sick.

30:17.332 --> 30:20.233
Why haven't you told me
about this before?

30:22.136 --> 30:24.627
I thought there was something
I could do.

30:25.106 --> 30:26.300
There's not?

30:27.075 --> 30:32.945
Well, there's radical treatments,
but nobody wants to talk about those.

30:33.548 --> 30:36.517
Even the experts say
there's nothing to be done.

30:36.684 --> 30:38.549
Nothing but...

30:39.487 --> 30:41.853
Nothing but let him die.

30:44.359 --> 30:48.591
So I'm lying here, cursing God
for all his cruelties.

30:50.365 --> 30:53.163
Do you think God is losing any sleep?

30:54.836 --> 30:58.704
Why bring a kid into the world
just to make him suffer?

31:01.142 --> 31:05.272
I don't know, Mulder.
I've got such a connection to this boy.

31:08.449 --> 31:10.144
How old is he?

31:12.387 --> 31:14.981
You think it's because of William.

31:15.790 --> 31:21.695
l... I think our son left us both
with an emptiness that can't be filled.

31:25.500 --> 31:27.365
Just go to sleep.

31:29.137 --> 31:31.867
Let me curse God for a while.

31:34.175 --> 31:35.904
Thank you.

31:41.015 --> 31:42.744
Scratchy beard.

32:01.402 --> 32:05.429
There was something weird on
the toxicology report of the severed arm.

32:05.640 --> 32:07.505
What?

32:07.675 --> 32:11.202
I looked over the FBI evidence
reports again.

32:11.913 --> 32:14.438
In the tissue,
there were traces of a drug...

32:14.682 --> 32:18.209
...commonly given to patients
being treated with radiation...

32:18.386 --> 32:21.844
...and traces of a drug
called acepromazine.

32:22.023 --> 32:24.048
Why is that weird?

32:26.527 --> 32:29.963
Acepromazine's an animal tranquilizer.

32:35.970 --> 32:38.268
Now I can't sleep.

32:41.609 --> 32:42.769
Mulder?

32:42.944 --> 32:47.745
What is animal tranquilizer doing in the
tissue sample of a man's severed arm?

32:47.915 --> 32:49.473
I can't even begin to speculate.

32:50.284 --> 32:52.684
He said he heard barking dogs.

32:53.287 --> 32:55.448
- Who?
- Father Joe.

32:58.059 --> 33:00.152
Mulder, what are you doing?

33:00.328 --> 33:03.263
Is it a tranquilizer
that you might give a dog?

33:04.399 --> 33:08.460
He's a phony, Mulder. He pulls these
so-called visions out of thin air.

33:08.636 --> 33:10.627
He's got you
straining to connect them.

33:10.805 --> 33:13.501
When I see a man cry tears of blood
at a crime scene...

33:13.708 --> 33:17.303
...he recognizes without ever having
visited, I need to go out on a limb.

33:17.478 --> 33:19.070
Tears of blood?

33:19.781 --> 33:21.976
Yeah, some trick, huh?
How do you fake that?

33:27.989 --> 33:30.082
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, Dr. Scully?</i>

33:30.258 --> 33:32.749
- Yes.
- I have Dakota Whitney for you.

33:32.927 --> 33:34.827
Can you hold on a second?

33:35.963 --> 33:37.294
Sorry to call at this hour.

33:37.465 --> 33:39.660
- Has there been a break?
- They find her?

33:39.834 --> 33:42.962
- <i>We're pursuing another lead.</i>
- The same source?

33:43.304 --> 33:45.670
Same source, new news.

33:46.441 --> 33:48.841
It's here. It's here.

33:49.010 --> 33:51.035
Turn up ahead, at the barn.

33:59.954 --> 34:03.014
One more time. Ten minutes.

34:04.392 --> 34:06.360
- Did you find her?
- No.

34:09.530 --> 34:11.464
- What did you do?
- What?

34:15.168 --> 34:16.659
You said there was news.

34:17.205 --> 34:21.699
The news is our psychic led us to
the exact same site he led us to before.

34:27.348 --> 34:29.077
You're gonna find it.

34:29.283 --> 34:31.478
That's what you keep saying.

34:31.886 --> 34:33.649
You're gonna find a body.

34:33.821 --> 34:37.085
- You keep telling us she's alive.
- She is.

34:37.291 --> 34:39.282
We could do this all night.

34:40.527 --> 34:42.826
These guys are all running on empty.

34:44.364 --> 34:46.560
I'm sorry for bringing you out here.

34:48.735 --> 34:50.862
Hey, let's go, fellas!

34:51.038 --> 34:54.530
Bring it in! Let's go!
Bring it in, gentlemen.

34:54.708 --> 34:56.574
Time to go home.

34:56.744 --> 34:58.371
Tell me.

34:59.080 --> 35:00.308
Tell me what you see.

35:01.549 --> 35:04.017
I see a face.

35:05.586 --> 35:07.713
I see eyes staring out.

35:08.823 --> 35:10.188
Who?

35:11.058 --> 35:12.320
Who is it?

35:13.027 --> 35:15.188
It's unclear.

35:16.063 --> 35:17.428
Like through dirty glass.

35:21.636 --> 35:25.231
It's out there. I know it.

35:31.612 --> 35:34.979
What does he mean,
"Like through dirty glass"?

35:35.149 --> 35:36.411
- Mulder.
- What?

35:36.584 --> 35:37.642
Stop.

35:37.852 --> 35:40.286
Okay, feel free
to give up like everybody else.

35:40.454 --> 35:42.615
This is not my job anymore, Mulder.

35:42.790 --> 35:46.726
No, that's right. That's right. You're
just like my booking agent now, right?

35:46.894 --> 35:48.794
You're right.

35:48.963 --> 35:51.955
- This is my fault.
- What do you mean, it's your fault?

35:52.433 --> 35:54.060
For getting you involved in this.

35:54.235 --> 35:56.897
No. No.
It was the right thing to do, Scully.

35:57.071 --> 35:59.164
This is not about finding an FBI agent.

35:59.373 --> 36:01.967
This is about you
trying to save your sister.

36:05.980 --> 36:08.107
My sister is dead.

36:08.282 --> 36:11.080
It hasn't stopped you
from looking for her.

36:13.254 --> 36:16.280
Mulder, I have been through this
too many years with you...

36:16.457 --> 36:17.924
...believing you can save her.

36:18.092 --> 36:21.118
You cannot save her.
Not now, and not ever.

36:32.306 --> 36:34.831
I need those men back.

36:43.985 --> 36:47.284
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to ignore you.

37:06.173 --> 37:07.663
This is it. Here it is.

37:12.146 --> 37:13.704
This is it.

37:20.087 --> 37:21.486
We need shovels.

37:35.169 --> 37:36.966
It's solid ice.

37:40.341 --> 37:43.538
No. It's dirty glass.

37:47.882 --> 37:49.474
Flashlight?

38:11.105 --> 38:13.300
You're gonna need resources.

38:16.510 --> 38:20.207
We need equipment.
Concrete saws and a backhoe.

38:20.381 --> 38:23.009
You two, get on the line.
You two, come with me.

38:33.294 --> 38:35.421
Don't give up.

39:08.929 --> 39:10.590
Please!

39:10.931 --> 39:13.126
Get me out of here!

39:14.135 --> 39:16.569
Help! Help!

39:17.004 --> 39:19.370
Get me out of here!

39:19.607 --> 39:23.338
Please, please. Please, I won't tell.

39:24.111 --> 39:27.808
I won't tell anyone. I won't tell anyone.
Just let me go.

39:27.982 --> 39:30.815
I just want to go home.
I'm sorry I hit your truck.

39:30.985 --> 39:34.216
I didn't mean to do it.
I didn't mean to hit your truck.

39:34.388 --> 39:36.288
I didn't mean it.

39:38.225 --> 39:39.692
Wait. Stop.

39:39.860 --> 39:41.953
Wait. Wait.

39:46.734 --> 39:50.033
What is this place? Who are you?

40:12.126 --> 40:14.560
Please, just get me out of here.

40:15.229 --> 40:16.753
Get up.

40:18.032 --> 40:21.058
I can help you.
Just get me out of here.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.661
Help!

40:26.740 --> 40:30.267
I think we can resolve, then, in
good conscience and without objection...

40:30.444 --> 40:37.350
...to relocate the patient to a facility
suited for and humane to his condition.

40:40.020 --> 40:43.683
As you and I discussed, Dr. Scully,
I was informing the staff and doctors...

40:43.858 --> 40:46.383
...of the hospital's decision
on Christian Fearon.

40:48.362 --> 40:49.852
I'm sorry, what decision?

40:51.732 --> 40:57.227
To relocate the patient to a hospice
who will manage his palliative care.

40:57.738 --> 40:59.899
That was a discussion, not a decision.

41:00.074 --> 41:04.773
Well, it's been discussed here at length,
with no objection from your colleagues.

41:04.945 --> 41:06.207
I have an objection.

41:06.447 --> 41:10.713
You have, Dr. Scully,
a patient with an untreatable condition.

41:10.885 --> 41:14.150
Now, that's very sad and unfortunate.
Nobody disagrees with that.

41:14.321 --> 41:16.653
- But he's my patient.
- Unless you've come here...

41:16.824 --> 41:18.655
...with a cure for Sandhoff disease...

41:18.826 --> 41:21.624
...we all ask
that you let the boy go in peace.

41:26.500 --> 41:27.967
Thank you.

41:29.103 --> 41:32.732
Now, I'd like to wrap up so we can get
on to the day's good work.

41:32.907 --> 41:35.740
We have the final matter of a patient
in intensive care...

41:35.910 --> 41:37.673
...Dr. Willard's patient, I believe.

41:37.845 --> 41:40.609
Admitted after suffering
myocardial infarction during...

41:40.781 --> 41:44.444
- There is a treatment.
- The matter is resolved, Dr. Scully.

41:46.453 --> 41:47.943
No, it's not.

41:50.324 --> 41:53.623
The disease can be treated
with intrathecal stem-cell therapy.

41:53.794 --> 41:57.787
You're not serious.
Don't put the boy through hell.

41:57.965 --> 42:01.924
- Would you do it if it was your son?
- It's not her son and he's not yours.

42:02.102 --> 42:06.300
And it's not a decision for hospital
administration. It's his doctor's.

42:07.107 --> 42:08.836
If you'd like to challenge that...

42:09.009 --> 42:12.137
...you can take the matter up
with a higher authority.

42:12.313 --> 42:15.942
I have taken it up with
the highest authority, Dr. Scully.

42:19.053 --> 42:20.543
As should you.

42:44.378 --> 42:45.402
Come on, pick up.

42:48.916 --> 42:50.315
Come on.

42:52.720 --> 42:53.982
Come on. Answer.

43:06.333 --> 43:08.494
<i>This is Dana Scully,</i>
<i>please leave a message.</i>

43:08.669 --> 43:10.830
Scully, it's me.
I keep leaving you messages.

43:11.005 --> 43:12.495
Here's what I want to tell you.

43:12.673 --> 43:16.006
That woman's head in the ice?
It's not the agent's. It's not Bannan's.

43:16.176 --> 43:18.007
We don't know who she is,
but so far...

43:18.178 --> 43:22.012
...we've pulled 11 discrete human limbs
from the ice and we're not done yet.

43:22.182 --> 43:24.241
<i>Each one a clean cut too.</i>

43:24.418 --> 43:27.751
<i>An exact match to the previous</i>
<i>amputation you noted, Scully.</i>

43:27.921 --> 43:31.914
<i>It looks like someone's been dumping</i>
<i>body parts in the ice there for months...</i>

43:32.092 --> 43:36.426
<i>... possibly years. And there seems</i>
<i>to be no pattern to the limbs.</i>

43:36.597 --> 43:39.464
<i>Men and women, all with healthy,</i>
<i>undiseased tissue...</i>

43:39.633 --> 43:44.263
<i>... according to forensics, which suggests</i>
<i>to me that they are victims.</i>

43:44.838 --> 43:48.069
<i>But here's the thing,</i>
<i>what I need you to know.</i>

43:48.242 --> 43:51.609
We found more traces of your
animal tranquilizer, acepromazine.

43:51.779 --> 43:55.476
I don't know what the hell it means,
but I'm hoping you can make sense of it.

43:56.216 --> 43:57.808
- Anything?
- No, I can't reach her.

43:57.985 --> 44:01.421
But this is gonna make sense.
This is a break. I'm feeling it.

44:01.855 --> 44:05.586
You're feeling it. Father Joe's feeling it.
I'm feeling my head spinning.

44:05.759 --> 44:09.092
This is a serial case. You're gonna solve
a dozen murders here.

44:09.263 --> 44:11.390
Yes, but I'm no closer
to finding my agent.

44:11.565 --> 44:13.795
No, we're gonna find her. I know it.

44:14.501 --> 44:16.298
Well, she may have to stand in line.

44:16.470 --> 44:18.495
I see a woman's face.

44:18.672 --> 44:21.470
Another woman taken from a car.

44:21.642 --> 44:23.803
She's being held...

44:23.977 --> 44:25.968
...in a box, I think.

44:28.315 --> 44:29.942
Is she with Monica Bannan?

44:30.784 --> 44:31.978
I don't know.

44:32.152 --> 44:34.086
Is it the same men that took her?

44:34.988 --> 44:39.687
I think so. Yes. It's the same men.

44:41.428 --> 44:45.091
You see this, or are you just telling
these people what they wanna hear?

44:45.265 --> 44:47.927
- No.
- No, you don't see it.

44:50.104 --> 44:53.471
No, it's... It's the same men.

44:57.978 --> 44:59.878
- I want a car ready.
- To go where?

45:00.047 --> 45:01.105
I don't know yet.

45:01.548 --> 45:02.708
I don't believe this.

45:02.916 --> 45:05.282
That's been your problem
from the start.

45:05.519 --> 45:08.511
- I can get you a car.
- And a list of missing persons...

45:08.689 --> 45:10.953
...over the last 48 to 72 hours.

45:34.948 --> 45:37.143
- Hi.
- Hi.

45:44.158 --> 45:47.491
Cheryl Cunningham, 34,
never made it to work last night.

45:47.661 --> 45:49.595
No-show at home either.

45:50.664 --> 45:53.861
There's no blood on the airbags.
Driver's side window knocked out.

45:54.034 --> 45:57.993
Keys in the ignition.
Survivable crash with a seatbelt.

45:58.172 --> 46:00.333
She sets off, takes a shortcut...

46:00.574 --> 46:04.943
...gets tired, sits down, falls asleep.
Happens all the time.

46:05.112 --> 46:09.879
Hard left turn for such a long, straight
stretch of country road, don't you think?

46:10.050 --> 46:12.746
But why settle for my opinion?

46:37.778 --> 46:39.643
I'm sorry. I'm not getting anything.

46:40.447 --> 46:44.440
What a surprise. What a surprise.

46:53.327 --> 46:56.626
- I think we're done with Father Joe.
- Yeah.

47:03.937 --> 47:05.905
- We're not quite finished.
- What is that?

47:06.073 --> 47:09.304
Medical ID bracelet. I noticed
your missing agent wore one too.

47:09.476 --> 47:11.103
- For what?
- What are you thinking?

47:11.278 --> 47:12.768
Let's pop the trunk.

47:15.682 --> 47:18.446
- This isn't gonna do her much good.
- It's a gym bag.

47:19.686 --> 47:22.985
It's a bathing suit. It's frozen stiff.

47:25.425 --> 47:28.258
- Chlorine.
- Where's the nearest public pool?

47:39.940 --> 47:43.137
Hi. We're hoping you can help us.

47:43.310 --> 47:44.538
Would you like lockers?

47:44.711 --> 47:48.044
We're with the FBI. We'd like to show
you a photo, if you don't mind.

47:48.215 --> 47:50.080
Why would I mind?

47:50.517 --> 47:53.077
- Do you know this person?
- Let me see.

47:54.521 --> 47:57.285
These young people
look so much the same.

47:57.457 --> 48:00.358
- Do you have a sign-in register?
- Yes, I keep one every day.

48:00.527 --> 48:03.394
- I'd like to see yesterday's.
- I threw yesterday's away.

48:05.899 --> 48:09.596
Excuse me, sir. Doesn't he know
that's the women's side?

48:15.909 --> 48:17.672
Hi, Christian.

48:18.679 --> 48:23.048
You've got a whole bunch of people
taking good care of you today, okay?

48:25.652 --> 48:27.586
What?

48:27.754 --> 48:30.052
Now you look scared.

50:18.799 --> 50:20.824
People say I went underground.

50:23.670 --> 50:24.932
I'm sorry, Mulder.

50:30.277 --> 50:34.179
- I have to keep my focus here.
- It's the boy, isn't it?

50:34.781 --> 50:36.339
Yeah.

50:37.284 --> 50:39.115
I thought there was nothing
to be done.

50:39.286 --> 50:42.380
I'm taking a big chance on something.

50:43.290 --> 50:46.191
On a radical and extremely painful
new procedure.

50:46.359 --> 50:48.623
Last night you said
that wasn't an option.

50:49.262 --> 50:52.493
It wasn't last night.

50:52.666 --> 50:54.657
What changed your mind?

51:06.272 --> 51:08.069
When will you know if it's working?

51:08.274 --> 51:10.174
There's a series of these procedures...

51:10.343 --> 51:12.573
...and we won't know
until they're all done.

51:17.183 --> 51:20.346
But that's not
what you came to talk about.

51:20.520 --> 51:22.420
There's another woman missing.

51:24.157 --> 51:26.022
She's given us something to go on.

51:26.192 --> 51:28.854
She and the missing agent
swam at the same pool.

51:29.028 --> 51:31.826
The agent kept a locker there.
We think they were stalked.

51:31.998 --> 51:33.693
Both wore medical ID bracelets...

51:33.866 --> 51:36.494
...and both had the same rare
blood type: A-B negative.

51:37.170 --> 51:40.662
Organs harvested for transplant.
That's how they were targeted.

51:40.840 --> 51:43.400
Donors and recipients
need matched types.

51:43.576 --> 51:45.271
Someone using that pool knows that.

51:45.445 --> 51:47.709
Black market. Somebody filling orders.

51:47.880 --> 51:50.906
Well, they have access.
Recipients, hospitals.

51:51.084 --> 51:54.417
That's your world. Your knowledge
will save time. Time is our enemy.

51:54.587 --> 51:57.283
Start with the transporters.
Call the Richmond DA.

51:57.457 --> 52:00.119
No, no, no,
I need you on this with me.

52:02.462 --> 52:04.453
No. No, Mulder.

52:04.630 --> 52:08.726
You asked for me to get involved, Scully.
Now I'm asking for you to stay involved.

52:08.901 --> 52:12.803
Mulder. You helped them already.
You broke the case for them.

52:12.972 --> 52:16.237
- Why don't you let the FBI pursue it?
- We're so close now.

52:16.409 --> 52:19.810
- I'm asking you to let it go.
- It's not that simple.

52:19.979 --> 52:22.277
No. It's complicated.

52:22.448 --> 52:24.439
What is that supposed to mean?

52:24.617 --> 52:27.609
Something I knew would happen,
that I've been afraid of...

52:27.787 --> 52:30.119
...that I haven't had to face until now.

52:30.289 --> 52:33.224
What? Just say it.

52:34.927 --> 52:38.090
I'm a doctor, Mulder.

52:38.765 --> 52:41.563
- That's not my life anymore.
- I know that.

52:43.102 --> 52:44.660
You're not understanding me.

52:44.871 --> 52:48.671
I can't look into the darkness
with you anymore, Mulder.

52:48.875 --> 52:51.901
I cannot stand what it does
to you or to me.

52:52.178 --> 52:56.114
I'm fine with it, Scully.
I'm actually okay. I'm good.

52:56.282 --> 52:57.943
Yeah, that's what scares me.

52:58.117 --> 53:01.746
Where else would you have me look if
you want me to find these women alive?

53:02.155 --> 53:04.988
I'm asking you to look at yourself.

53:07.093 --> 53:11.257
Why? l... I don't think
I'm the one who's changed.

53:11.431 --> 53:14.798
We're not FBI anymore, Mulder.

53:15.968 --> 53:18.869
We are two people
who come home at night.

53:19.038 --> 53:21.302
To a home now.

53:21.808 --> 53:23.833
I don't want that darkness in my home.

53:24.010 --> 53:27.309
Scully, this is who I am.

53:27.547 --> 53:30.812
It's who I've always been.
This is who I was before I met you.

53:30.983 --> 53:35.113
- It's what I do. It's everything I know.
- Write it down.

53:35.488 --> 53:36.819
Put it in a book.

53:38.157 --> 53:40.022
Are you asking me to give up?

53:41.360 --> 53:42.952
No.

53:44.063 --> 53:46.930
I can't tell you to do that, Mulder.

53:49.735 --> 53:52.295
But I can tell you that...

53:52.872 --> 53:54.703
...I won't be coming home.

53:54.874 --> 53:56.364
Scully.

53:59.145 --> 54:01.136
Mulder,
I've got my own battles to fight.

54:01.314 --> 54:03.578
- Don't do this.
- Please don't argue with me.

54:03.749 --> 54:05.876
Don't do this now.

54:07.086 --> 54:10.317
I don't know what else to do.

54:31.010 --> 54:32.500
Well...

54:33.913 --> 54:35.847
Good luck, then.

54:41.687 --> 54:43.177
You too.

54:53.599 --> 54:55.226
Dr. Scully?

54:56.202 --> 55:00.036
We'd like to speak with you,
if we may, about Christian.

55:00.206 --> 55:03.801
- Have you been in to see him?
- Yes. He was sleeping.

55:04.010 --> 55:06.808
- But we've...
- We've changed our minds...

55:07.013 --> 55:09.948
...about going forward
with this new treatment.

55:10.883 --> 55:13.374
But you don't even know
if it's working yet.

55:13.886 --> 55:16.150
We think that Christian's
been through enough.

55:17.123 --> 55:19.785
We want to put our faith in God now.

55:20.960 --> 55:23.929
- I see.
- It's nothing against you.

55:24.096 --> 55:25.222
No.

55:25.398 --> 55:27.832
If you were a mother,
you'd understand.

55:28.834 --> 55:30.961
Have you spoken to Father Ybarra?

55:35.074 --> 55:38.237
Yes. But the decision is ours.

55:44.083 --> 55:46.608
What if it did work?

55:48.921 --> 55:52.550
What if we found we'd made
the wrong choice by stopping?

55:55.561 --> 55:58.052
You're saying you can save my son?

56:01.701 --> 56:04.636
I'm saying
I don't want to give up now.

56:09.342 --> 56:11.333
We're about to hit the tarmac...

56:11.510 --> 56:14.377
...when all of a sudden,
the plane gears up...

56:14.580 --> 56:16.138
...and we're back up in the air.

56:16.315 --> 56:21.981
I say, "Honey, isn't this fantastic?
We're going to die together."

56:22.154 --> 56:25.146
Turns out there was a plane
parked on the tarmac...

56:25.324 --> 56:27.554
...and we missed colliding with it
by seconds.

56:29.195 --> 56:31.993
But we were in love
and it was romantic.

56:38.504 --> 56:42.031
Sir? Excuse me, sir?
Can we talk with you a minute?

56:44.110 --> 56:45.975
I'm transporting vital organ.

56:46.145 --> 56:49.581
- That's what we'd like to talk about.
- This is my job. I move quickly.

56:49.749 --> 56:51.717
I don't have much time.

56:51.884 --> 56:54.250
Please, sir. Step over here.

56:56.555 --> 57:00.184
My name is Robert Koell, with the
District Attorney's office in Richmond.

57:00.359 --> 57:02.759
- May I see your license?
- I have green card.

57:02.928 --> 57:05.897
- What are you transporting?
- Human liver for transplant.

57:06.699 --> 57:08.394
Paperwork and license, please.

57:08.567 --> 57:10.660
Where are you delivering it?

57:11.837 --> 57:16.001
Willow's Memorial Hospital. They're
expecting it. A patient wait for it.

57:16.175 --> 57:19.906
Have you procured or delivered an organ
outside of normal or lawful channels?

57:23.916 --> 57:25.076
No.

57:25.251 --> 57:28.778
You're an employee. How would
your employer answer this question?

57:28.954 --> 57:31.218
He's sick. Has cancer.

57:31.657 --> 57:33.591
That's not what I asked you.

57:35.094 --> 57:37.790
Am I under some kind of suspicion?

57:58.284 --> 58:00.548
A vision, if ever I had one.

58:02.488 --> 58:04.183
May I speak with you?

58:05.558 --> 58:07.082
Would you like to come in?

58:18.571 --> 58:20.903
Make yourself comfortable.

58:21.807 --> 58:23.468
I won't be staying long.

58:23.642 --> 58:25.803
Have you come here by yourself?

58:26.245 --> 58:27.769
Yes.

58:28.647 --> 58:30.239
Sit.

58:31.283 --> 58:32.716
Please, I insist.

58:44.764 --> 58:47.289
Now, you came to ask something.

58:48.534 --> 58:52.436
We're alone,
free to speak in confidence.

59:00.146 --> 59:03.309
You said something to me
the other night in the snow.

59:03.482 --> 59:07.543
- Yes. I said, "Don't give up."
- I need to know why you said that.

59:08.888 --> 59:11.152
I haven't the faintest idea.

59:11.323 --> 59:14.952
- Were you hoping for another answer?
- Do you know anything about me?

59:15.127 --> 59:16.856
Other than that you loathe me?

59:17.029 --> 59:19.554
- Do you know what it is that I do?
- No.

59:19.765 --> 59:23.496
I can see you're a woman of faith. But
not in the same things as your husband.

59:23.669 --> 59:26.638
- He's not my husband.
- Do you care to tell me about yourself?

59:26.806 --> 59:29.206
- No.
- Do you care to offer a confession?

59:29.375 --> 59:30.899
- I don't think you're...
- What?

59:31.076 --> 59:35.536
In a position to judge?
Yet you've judged me, haven't you?

59:35.714 --> 59:38.842
- You deserve to be judged.
- Do you know why we live here?

59:39.018 --> 59:42.510
The men who call this vile box
of monsters home?

59:42.688 --> 59:45.919
Because we hate each other,
even as we hate ourselves...

59:46.091 --> 59:49.652
...for our sickening appetites.
- That doesn't make it less sickening.

59:49.829 --> 59:51.160
And where do they come from?

59:51.330 --> 59:54.356
These appetites,
these uncontrollable urges of ours?

59:54.533 --> 59:57.229
- Not from God.
- Not from me.

59:57.403 --> 01:00:00.839
I castrated myself when I was 26.

01:00:01.006 --> 01:00:03.031
And the visions weren't my idea either.

01:00:03.609 --> 01:00:06.874
- Proverbs 25:2.
- What?

01:00:07.046 --> 01:00:09.708
God's glory to conceal a thing...

01:00:09.882 --> 01:00:12.715
...but the honor of kings
to search out a matter.

01:00:12.885 --> 01:00:15.513
- Don't quote scripture to me.
- What are you doing here?

01:00:15.688 --> 01:00:19.715
- What are you afraid of?
- "Don't give up." What was that for?

01:00:19.892 --> 01:00:21.621
- I don't know.
- I don't believe you.

01:00:21.894 --> 01:00:24.362
- I'm telling you the truth.
- They were your words.

01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:26.725
- I don't know why.
- You said them to my face!

01:00:26.899 --> 01:00:29.424
All I ever wanted was to serve him.

01:00:29.602 --> 01:00:32.935
All I've ever wanted was to serve God.

01:00:34.707 --> 01:00:37.733
You can ask for his pity,
but don't expect mine.

01:00:39.378 --> 01:00:42.108
You can stop the act any time.

01:00:45.784 --> 01:00:47.615
Look at me.

01:02:07.466 --> 01:02:10.697
Paramedics have been here now.
They've been here for seven minutes.

01:02:10.869 --> 01:02:15.829
He's stabilized. Blood pressure's normal.
No, they're loading him in now.

01:02:16.008 --> 01:02:18.841
- What happened?
- Thank you. He had a seizure.

01:02:19.011 --> 01:02:21.070
- Who called you?
- No one.

01:02:21.647 --> 01:02:23.478
So, what are you doing here?

01:02:25.684 --> 01:02:27.845
We need to talk to Father Joe.

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:31.046
- Well, that's not gonna happen.
- We've got a suspect.

01:02:31.223 --> 01:02:33.714
A Russian √©migr√©
working as an organ transporter.

01:02:33.959 --> 01:02:35.756
- In custody?
- No.

01:02:35.961 --> 01:02:39.021
The DA questioned him
about trafficking black-market organs...

01:02:39.198 --> 01:02:42.429
...but he was released.
They had no evidence to hold him.

01:02:42.601 --> 01:02:45.365
We've got a witness who says
he swam at the women's pool.

01:02:45.537 --> 01:02:46.663
ASAC Whitney?

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.600
- Excuse me.
- What's that got to do with Father Joe?

01:02:50.776 --> 01:02:53.370
- It's the man in his visions, Scully.
- Who?

01:02:53.545 --> 01:02:57.379
- The suspect. The man in this photo.
- Now you're wasting their time.

01:02:58.550 --> 01:03:00.347
Tell me again what you're doing here.

01:03:00.519 --> 01:03:04.250
Here's a vision for you.
A couple of my guys just had it.

01:03:04.857 --> 01:03:06.256
Who's this?

01:03:06.425 --> 01:03:09.883
Our suspect's employer. An old friend
of Father Joe's, we just learned.

01:03:10.062 --> 01:03:12.587
- Known him for over 20 years.
- Known him how?

01:03:12.765 --> 01:03:15.996
That's one of his 37 altar boys.

01:03:17.936 --> 01:03:21.303
Three guesses who he's married
to in the state of Massachusetts.

01:03:22.007 --> 01:03:23.235
Our suspect.

01:03:23.409 --> 01:03:25.741
We got a warrant
to search their offices.

01:03:30.049 --> 01:03:31.607
Mulder.

01:03:35.087 --> 01:03:36.577
It's over.

01:03:38.323 --> 01:03:41.258
- Hey, hey! Hey!
- What? Mulder.

01:04:05.818 --> 01:04:07.683
Why don't you hold up?

01:04:08.454 --> 01:04:09.819
Let these men do their jobs.

01:04:13.959 --> 01:04:15.426
Clear this bottom floor.

01:04:16.962 --> 01:04:19.522
We were fooled.
I wanted to believe as bad as anyone.

01:04:19.698 --> 01:04:21.188
Look, I don't need sweet talk.

01:04:21.366 --> 01:04:24.358
- You led us here.
- Father Joe led us here.

01:04:27.973 --> 01:04:30.203
This is Special Agent Drummy
with the FBI.

01:04:30.375 --> 01:04:32.673
We have warrants
to search these offices.

01:04:32.845 --> 01:04:36.611
Anyone inside, identify yourself
and unlock the door now.

01:04:36.782 --> 01:04:39.273
I called you in
because I thought you could help me.

01:04:39.451 --> 01:04:42.716
- I valued your belief in these phenomena.
- Now what do you think?

01:04:43.222 --> 01:04:45.588
I think this is a longer conversation.

01:04:46.959 --> 01:04:51.157
Down on the floor! Down on the floor!
Anybody here, I want down on the floor!

01:05:14.353 --> 01:05:16.184
Somebody find the lights.

01:05:16.355 --> 01:05:18.983
We were at a standstill. You pushed
forward, no matter the direction we took.

01:05:24.696 --> 01:05:26.163
Hey!

01:05:32.404 --> 01:05:33.894
Hey!

01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:40.177
What are you, nuts?

01:06:01.366 --> 01:06:02.390
Hey!

01:06:03.669 --> 01:06:05.398
Stop him!

01:06:06.905 --> 01:06:08.304
Hey, you can't go...

01:06:09.975 --> 01:06:11.237
Hey.

01:06:18.917 --> 01:06:20.282
Come on.

01:06:25.991 --> 01:06:28.323
- Quick, which way did they go?
- Down that way.

01:06:44.810 --> 01:06:46.744
- Mulder!
- I'm up here!

01:07:53.645 --> 01:07:55.340
Mulder!

01:07:55.981 --> 01:07:57.175
He's coming at you.

01:07:58.283 --> 01:07:59.773
Hey!

01:08:09.728 --> 01:08:11.195
Mulder!

01:08:11.363 --> 01:08:13.194
- Yeah.
- Where are you?

01:08:13.699 --> 01:08:16.497
- Right here.
- Where?

01:08:26.211 --> 01:08:27.678
Fox.

01:08:28.412 --> 01:08:31.871
- Where is he? Do you have him?
- No. I lost him.

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:35.809
- I saw him.
- Where?

01:09:09.888 --> 01:09:11.082
They're both dead.

01:09:12.791 --> 01:09:16.227
Monica Bannan and Dakota Whitney.

01:09:16.395 --> 01:09:19.386
I heard. I'm sorry.

01:09:20.232 --> 01:09:21.859
Yeah, well...

01:09:22.567 --> 01:09:26.731
- I thought we were winning, Scully.
- I know you did, Mulder.

01:09:29.808 --> 01:09:32.106
I'm here to see Father Joe.

01:09:33.377 --> 01:09:37.109
I wanna show him these photographs
of these men.

01:09:39.084 --> 01:09:40.448
You still wanna believe him.

01:09:47.158 --> 01:09:51.425
I think you should know that he's been
diagnosed with a terminal illness.

01:09:51.897 --> 01:09:53.591
He has advanced-stage lung cancer.

01:09:57.469 --> 01:09:59.528
I just wanna be sure.

01:10:03.909 --> 01:10:06.002
Then let me ask him.

01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:11.314
You wouldn't believe...

01:10:12.451 --> 01:10:13.645
I was thinking of you.

01:10:14.419 --> 01:10:18.446
I had a vision
you might find interesting.

01:10:19.491 --> 01:10:22.016
Of a man speaking a foreign language.

01:10:22.961 --> 01:10:25.429
Did he happen to look like this?

01:10:29.734 --> 01:10:31.463
Yeah. That's the man.

01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:32.962
How did you know?

01:10:33.538 --> 01:10:36.530
We think he's the man
who abducted the FBI agent...

01:10:36.708 --> 01:10:38.699
...and the second woman
you say you saw...

01:10:38.877 --> 01:10:41.004
...and possibly many more.

01:10:41.179 --> 01:10:44.239
And we think that he was helped...

01:10:44.449 --> 01:10:45.814
...by this man.

01:10:49.221 --> 01:10:51.883
- I don't know who that is.
- Are you sure?

01:10:52.057 --> 01:10:55.720
I'm fairly certain. I don't know him.

01:10:55.894 --> 01:10:57.862
I'm fairly certain that you do.

01:10:59.865 --> 01:11:02.595
And that you've known him
since he was a boy.

01:11:14.179 --> 01:11:16.477
Oh, no.

01:11:20.418 --> 01:11:22.511
It can't be true.

01:11:25.223 --> 01:11:26.747
I don't believe this.

01:11:28.793 --> 01:11:30.852
He was my connection to the girl.

01:11:32.531 --> 01:11:35.227
My visions were to save her from him.

01:11:37.369 --> 01:11:39.599
This is God's work.

01:11:41.206 --> 01:11:42.639
This is God's work.

01:11:44.442 --> 01:11:47.309
Let me ask you one more question,
Father Joe.

01:11:48.146 --> 01:11:50.011
The FBI agent...

01:11:50.549 --> 01:11:54.246
...the first woman that you saw,
Monica Bannan...

01:11:55.587 --> 01:11:57.248
...is she still alive?

01:12:03.528 --> 01:12:05.393
I feel her.

01:12:07.299 --> 01:12:08.664
Yes.

01:12:09.634 --> 01:12:11.124
She's still alive.

01:12:20.812 --> 01:12:22.803
- Mulder.
- That second victim may be alive.

01:12:22.981 --> 01:12:25.074
Everybody's given up,
but I'm not going to.

01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:28.583
Mulder, you think I don't understand,
but I do.

01:12:28.753 --> 01:12:33.452
This stubbornness of yours,
it's why I fell in love with you.

01:12:34.292 --> 01:12:35.657
It's like you said.

01:12:37.829 --> 01:12:40.161
And it's why we can't be together.

01:14:18.797 --> 01:14:20.128
Whoa, hold up.

01:14:20.298 --> 01:14:23.699
- Hey. Hey, sorry to bother you.
- I'm closed.

01:14:23.868 --> 01:14:27.895
- No, I just need a moment of your time.
- We've got some bad weather coming in.

01:14:28.073 --> 01:14:30.405
You'd better get
wherever you're going fast.

01:14:32.877 --> 01:14:34.469
So, what do you need?

01:14:34.679 --> 01:14:38.740
Yeah, I was wondering if you carry an
animal tranquilizer called acepromazine?

01:14:39.551 --> 01:14:42.315
- You got a prescription for it?
- No, I don't.

01:14:42.487 --> 01:14:44.546
Well, I can't sell it to you, then.

01:14:44.723 --> 01:14:49.456
Can you tell me
if you've ever sold any to this man?

01:14:49.627 --> 01:14:52.494
- I am never getting out of here.
- I'm just...

01:14:55.266 --> 01:14:56.961
Nutter's Feed.

01:15:01.906 --> 01:15:04.466
Yep, I was just closing up
and I'm gonna pick him up.

01:15:04.642 --> 01:15:07.770
Yeah. Goodbye. Yeah.

01:15:12.617 --> 01:15:15.484
- What happened to the other guy?
- Who?

01:15:16.454 --> 01:15:19.082
The guy who was standing right here.

01:15:20.291 --> 01:15:22.521
I need to refill this now.

01:15:24.129 --> 01:15:25.790
Okay.

01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:14.157
- <i>Yeah, it's me.</i>
- Shit.

01:18:14.332 --> 01:18:16.527
<i>I must be busy right now.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

01:18:17.335 --> 01:18:20.031
<i>Mulder, I just found something</i>
<i>in my stem-cell research.</i>

01:18:20.204 --> 01:18:23.662
<i>Experiments being done in Russia</i>
<i>on dogs, Mulder.</i>

01:18:23.841 --> 01:18:27.208
<i>I think that's what your suspects</i>
<i>have been doing, only on humans.</i>

01:18:27.412 --> 01:18:31.041
<i>Those women who've been abducted...</i>
<i>You've got to call me.</i>

01:18:31.816 --> 01:18:33.511
Mulder, the FBI agent's alive.

01:19:32.410 --> 01:19:35.345
FBI Special Agent in Charge
Fossa speaking.

01:19:38.216 --> 01:19:39.740
It's for you.

01:19:40.385 --> 01:19:44.116
- This is Special Agent Drummy.
- <i>I've been trying to find you for hours.</i>

01:19:44.288 --> 01:19:46.256
I can't reach Mulder.

01:19:46.424 --> 01:19:48.858
- Is this Dr. Scully?
- <i>Yes, it's Dr. Scully.</i>

01:19:49.027 --> 01:19:52.258
- <i>Well, where is he?</i>
- If I knew that, I wouldn't be calling.

01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:56.924
Dr. Scully, I'm gonna suggest you call
the police. This is not an FBI matter.

01:19:57.101 --> 01:19:58.762
Listen to me.

01:19:59.103 --> 01:20:00.798
I need your help.

01:20:01.005 --> 01:20:03.030
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

01:20:03.207 --> 01:20:05.698
Then let me talk to someone
with some balls, who can.

01:20:27.165 --> 01:20:28.598
No, don't touch me!

01:20:34.572 --> 01:20:36.403
Don't touch me!

01:22:02.426 --> 01:22:04.553
You're going to be fine.

01:22:11.569 --> 01:22:14.333
I've taken care of it.
I've taken good care of it.

01:22:14.505 --> 01:22:16.063
You don't need this one anymore.

01:23:14.565 --> 01:23:17.466
Look at me. You're going to live.

01:23:17.802 --> 01:23:20.270
You're going to have a fine,
strong body.

01:24:29.674 --> 01:24:32.040
Down. Down.

01:24:48.192 --> 01:24:50.023
Excuse me.

01:24:50.428 --> 01:24:53.397
- I'm Dana Scully and that's my car.
- Right.

01:24:53.564 --> 01:24:56.431
I talked to some bigwig at the FBI.
Called from Washington.

01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:00.036
Yeah. That's him. Walter Skinner.

01:25:00.871 --> 01:25:03.863
Is there any indication what happened?
Or any footprints?

01:25:04.108 --> 01:25:08.169
Nothing. Snow's pretty heavy.
But we did find this.

01:25:08.346 --> 01:25:11.838
You might want to give it to him.
Excuse me.

01:25:12.683 --> 01:25:14.776
His cell phone, it's got blood on it.

01:25:14.952 --> 01:25:18.115
Listen to me. Calm down. Stop
and think. He's okay. He's gotta be.

01:25:18.322 --> 01:25:21.814
He climbed out of there. If he
climbed out, he probably climbed up.

01:26:23.988 --> 01:26:25.148
Stop.

01:26:25.423 --> 01:26:27.323
Back off. Back away.

01:26:28.492 --> 01:26:29.823
Back off!

01:26:30.494 --> 01:26:35.329
Do you speak English? Do you speak
English? Anybody speak English?

01:26:35.499 --> 01:26:37.330
I want her out of here.

01:26:37.501 --> 01:26:42.529
I want those tubes out of her neck
and I want her neck sewn up. Do it!

01:27:11.669 --> 01:27:13.330
We will find him.

01:27:18.209 --> 01:27:21.007
I know Mulder.
He'd get to a phone and call first.

01:27:21.345 --> 01:27:23.472
He didn't do anything crazy.

01:27:27.551 --> 01:27:29.382
Not overly crazy.

01:28:10.694 --> 01:28:12.423
Wait a minute. Back up.

01:28:18.369 --> 01:28:20.337
Stop.

01:28:29.113 --> 01:28:30.774
What is it?

01:28:37.955 --> 01:28:40.014
Proverbs 25:2.

01:28:55.639 --> 01:28:57.834
The glory of God to hide a thing.

01:29:00.444 --> 01:29:05.006
I've got it. It's an invoice for medical
supplies to a Dr. Uroff-Koltoff.

01:29:05.182 --> 01:29:07.673
It's an address on Bellflower Road.

01:29:11.655 --> 01:29:13.646
- Listen.
- What?

01:29:23.267 --> 01:29:25.360
Dogs. Dogs.

01:30:13.517 --> 01:30:14.643
Hey!

01:30:18.055 --> 01:30:19.181
Mulder.

01:30:20.424 --> 01:30:21.721
Can you hear me?

01:30:24.228 --> 01:30:25.820
Sorry about your car.

01:30:28.899 --> 01:30:31.163
The girl is still inside.

01:30:39.176 --> 01:30:40.336
Show me your hands!

01:30:41.245 --> 01:30:42.439
Show me your hands!

01:30:43.514 --> 01:30:46.005
Put the scalpel down!
Put the scalpel down!

01:30:46.183 --> 01:30:48.777
Just get it down or I'll blow
your goddamn hand off!

01:30:49.286 --> 01:30:50.844
Get over there!

01:30:52.156 --> 01:30:54.181
God, what have you done?

01:30:54.358 --> 01:30:55.950
What have you done?

01:30:59.396 --> 01:31:01.193
Mulder needs warm clothes and fluids.

01:31:04.935 --> 01:31:06.664
Oh, God.

01:31:08.939 --> 01:31:10.429
I've got work to do here.

01:31:10.607 --> 01:31:13.269
Get in! Get in!

01:31:28.225 --> 01:31:29.715
All right, Mulder.

01:31:30.794 --> 01:31:34.321
- The girl inside...
- Scully's got her. She's in good hands.

01:31:36.266 --> 01:31:38.564
- Skinner?
- Yeah.

01:31:40.270 --> 01:31:41.897
Cold.

01:31:42.606 --> 01:31:44.005
I got you.

01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:47.233
I got you.

01:32:00.457 --> 01:32:01.788
Mulder?

01:32:01.959 --> 01:32:03.654
What's up, doc?

01:32:05.863 --> 01:32:07.956
Father Joe is dead.

01:32:15.839 --> 01:32:18.467
He was clearly a very sick man.

01:32:25.482 --> 01:32:26.881
Did you see this story?

01:32:29.119 --> 01:32:32.282
The FBI is claiming Father Joe
was an accomplice.

01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:36.016
Not a word
about his psychic connection.

01:32:36.994 --> 01:32:38.655
He's dead, Mulder.

01:32:39.563 --> 01:32:44.000
- We'll never know.
- I know, Scully, and I can prove it.

01:32:44.168 --> 01:32:46.295
Father Joe died of lung cancer, right?

01:32:46.470 --> 01:32:49.871
The same as that man that Dr. Frankenstein
tried to give a new body.

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:52.531
What time did you pull tubes
from that woman's neck?

01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:54.973
What time did you cut
blood to that man's head?

01:32:55.145 --> 01:32:57.909
That's when Father Joe died.
Get me his death certificate.

01:32:58.081 --> 01:33:00.413
I'll take it to the FBI
and I'll show them.

01:33:00.584 --> 01:33:03.018
Do you think they're really
gonna take your call?

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:05.545
It's an injustice to the man's name.

01:33:08.192 --> 01:33:12.026
Well, considering his crimes
against those young boys...

01:33:12.196 --> 01:33:15.359
...who is really gonna care?
- I thought you believed him too.

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:18.300
I wanted to believe him.

01:33:19.002 --> 01:33:21.937
I did believe him.
I acted on that belief.

01:33:27.878 --> 01:33:30.813
Why don't you just tell me
what he said to you?

01:33:52.069 --> 01:33:53.969
He told me:

01:33:55.138 --> 01:33:56.605
"Don't give up."

01:33:59.076 --> 01:34:02.443
And I didn't. And it saved your life.

01:34:05.449 --> 01:34:07.940
But I've put that boy through hell.

01:34:08.585 --> 01:34:11.418
And I have another surgery
scheduled for this morning...

01:34:11.588 --> 01:34:15.046
...because I believed
that God was telling me to.

01:34:15.859 --> 01:34:18.453
Through a pedophile priest, no less.

01:34:20.430 --> 01:34:23.558
What if Father Joe's prayers
were answered after all?

01:34:25.168 --> 01:34:26.795
What if he were forgiven?

01:34:28.238 --> 01:34:30.502
Because he didn't give up.

01:34:36.947 --> 01:34:39.381
Try proving that one, Mulder.

01:34:45.255 --> 01:34:47.382
I'm due at the hospital.

01:34:54.798 --> 01:34:56.459
Scully?

01:34:57.834 --> 01:34:59.165
Why would he say that?

01:35:00.938 --> 01:35:05.170
"Don't give up."
Why would he say such a thing to you?

01:35:09.346 --> 01:35:11.439
I think that was meant
for you, Mulder.

01:35:11.615 --> 01:35:13.480
He didn't say it to me.

01:35:13.684 --> 01:35:15.777
He said it to you.

01:35:20.490 --> 01:35:21.980
If Father Joe were the devil...

01:35:22.159 --> 01:35:25.458
...why would he say the opposite
of what the devil might say?

01:35:28.465 --> 01:35:30.660
Maybe that's the answer.

01:35:30.834 --> 01:35:32.665
The larger answer.

01:35:34.037 --> 01:35:35.834
What do you mean?

01:35:36.707 --> 01:35:38.368
Don't give up.

01:35:45.148 --> 01:35:48.447
Please don't make this any harder
than it already is.

01:35:50.587 --> 01:35:53.021
It's okay.

01:35:56.026 --> 01:35:58.358
If you have any doubts...

01:35:58.862 --> 01:36:01.023
...any doubts at all...

01:36:01.765 --> 01:36:04.734
...just call off that surgery
this morning.

01:36:07.738 --> 01:36:10.070
And then we'll get out of here.

01:36:13.977 --> 01:36:16.104
Just me and you.

01:36:21.251 --> 01:36:24.880
As far away from the darkness
as we can get?

01:36:27.124 --> 01:36:29.558
I'm not sure it works that way.

01:36:30.027 --> 01:36:32.461
I think maybe the darkness finds you...

01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:34.187
...and me.

01:36:35.799 --> 01:36:37.596
I know it does.

01:36:42.739 --> 01:36:43.933
But let it try.

01:38:11.027 --> 01:38:13.007
Are you ready to begin,
Dr. Scully?

01:38:33.884 --> 01:38:35.545
Yes.
