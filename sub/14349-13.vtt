WEBVTT

00:04.728 --> 00:07.697
Personal log,
stardate 3013. 1.

00:07.764 --> 00:09.857
I find it hard
to believe

00:09.933 --> 00:11.798
the events
of the past 24 hours

00:11.868 --> 00:13.802
or the plea of Mr. Spock

00:13.870 --> 00:15.497
standing general
court-martial.

00:15.572 --> 00:16.698
How do you plead
to the charge

00:16.773 --> 00:19.173
of unlaw fully
taking command?

00:19.242 --> 00:20.504
Guilty.

00:20.577 --> 00:22.909
Of sabotaging the computers
of this vessel

00:22.979 --> 00:24.571
and locking it
on a course

00:24.648 --> 00:25.910
for planet Talos IV?

00:25.982 --> 00:27.006
Guilty.

00:27.083 --> 00:28.516
And of forcibly
attempting

00:28.585 --> 00:31.247
to transport Captain Pike
to that planet?

00:31.321 --> 00:32.378
Guilty.

00:32.455 --> 00:33.922
Why? Why does Spock

00:33.990 --> 00:37.153
want to take to that forbidden world
his former captain,

00:37.227 --> 00:39.320
mutilated by
a recentspace disaster,

00:39.396 --> 00:43.662
now a shell of a man,
unable to speak or move?

00:43.733 --> 00:46.065
The only answer
Spock would give

00:46.136 --> 00:48.570
was on
the hearing-room screen.

00:48.638 --> 00:50.469
Spock refused
to explain how,

00:50.540 --> 00:52.474
but there, before our eyes,

00:52.542 --> 00:55.807
actual images
from 13 years ago

00:55.879 --> 00:57.574
of Captain Pike as he was

00:57.647 --> 00:59.581
when he commanded
this vessel,

00:59.649 --> 01:01.640
of Spock in those days,

01:01.718 --> 01:03.515
and of how the Enterprise

01:03.587 --> 01:06.021
had become the first
and only starship

01:06.089 --> 01:07.954
to visit Talos IV.

01:09.893 --> 01:13.021
They had received
a distress signal from that planet

01:13.096 --> 01:14.188
and discovered there,

01:14.264 --> 01:16.357
still alive
after many years,

01:16.433 --> 01:18.993
the survivors
of a missing vessel,

01:19.069 --> 01:23.267
only to find
it wasallan illusion--

01:23.340 --> 01:25.535
No survivors...

01:25.609 --> 01:26.803
no encampment...

01:26.876 --> 01:29.003
it wasalla trap

01:29.079 --> 01:31.047
set bya race of beings

01:31.114 --> 01:34.049
who couldmake a man
believe he wasseeing

01:34.117 --> 01:36.051
anything they wished
him to see,

01:36.119 --> 01:37.746
and Captain Pike was gone,

01:37.821 --> 01:40.881
a prisoner for some
unknown purpose.

01:40.957 --> 01:42.857
The images we've
been seeing are--

01:42.926 --> 01:44.655
Are coming
from Talos IV.

01:44.728 --> 01:45.888
You're aware of orders

01:45.962 --> 01:48.396
regarding any contact
with Talos IV.

01:48.465 --> 01:52.026
You have deliberately invited
the death penalty.

01:55.138 --> 01:57.572
Do you know
what you're doing?

01:57.641 --> 01:59.575
Have you
lost your mind?

01:59.643 --> 02:00.541
Captain.

02:00.610 --> 02:02.009
Jim, please.

02:02.078 --> 02:04.012
Don't stop me.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.048
Don't let him stop me.

02:06.116 --> 02:09.551
It's your career
and Captain Pike's life.

02:09.619 --> 02:12.110
You must see the rest
of the transmission.

02:23.600 --> 02:27.036
Space--
the final frontier.

02:27.103 --> 02:31.039
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

02:31.107 --> 02:32.972
Its five-year mission--

02:33.043 --> 02:36.535
to explore
strange new worlds,

02:36.613 --> 02:40.549
to seek out newlife
and new civilizations,

02:40.617 --> 02:44.053
to boldly go where
no man has gone before.

03:17.954 --> 03:19.353
The court-martial
of Mr. Spock

03:19.422 --> 03:22.016
has been convened
in closed session.

03:22.092 --> 03:23.753
Despite all we can do,

03:23.827 --> 03:26.591
images continue to be
transmitted to us

03:26.663 --> 03:28.153
from Talos IV.

03:28.231 --> 03:31.098
Starfleet has ordered no
contact with Talos IV.

03:31.167 --> 03:33.158
They made no exceptions.

03:33.236 --> 03:35.261
You have no choice, sir.

03:35.338 --> 03:36.396
I'm sorry.

03:38.875 --> 03:41.503
The keeper has taken
control of our screen.

03:41.578 --> 03:43.102
Do you understand, sir?

03:44.614 --> 03:46.104
As you saw before,

03:46.182 --> 03:48.616
Captain Pike had been
knocked unconscious

03:48.685 --> 03:50.983
and captured by
the Talosians.

04:42.172 --> 04:43.799
Can you hear me?

04:45.508 --> 04:46.770
I'm Christopher Pike,

04:46.843 --> 04:48.777
commander of the space
vehicle Enterprise

04:48.845 --> 04:49.937
from the stellar group

04:50.013 --> 04:52.811
at the other end
of this galaxy.

04:54.684 --> 04:56.777
Our intentions
are peaceful.

04:56.853 --> 04:58.582
Can you understand me?

04:58.655 --> 05:00.088
It appears, Magistrate,

05:00.156 --> 05:02.056
that the intelligence
of the specimen

05:02.125 --> 05:03.683
is shockingly limited.

05:03.760 --> 05:07.560
This is no surprise since his vessel
was baited here so easily

05:07.630 --> 05:08.995
with a simulated
message.

05:09.065 --> 05:11.397
As you can read
in its thoughts,

05:11.468 --> 05:12.594
it only now suspects

05:12.669 --> 05:14.569
that the survivors
and encampment

05:14.637 --> 05:16.571
were an illusion we
placed in their minds.

05:16.639 --> 05:19.005
You're not speaking,
yet I hear you.

05:19.075 --> 05:20.167
Note the confusion

05:20.243 --> 05:22.268
asit reads our
thought transmissions.

05:22.345 --> 05:23.573
All right, then,
telepathy.

05:23.646 --> 05:26.080
You can read my mind.
I can read yours.

05:26.149 --> 05:28.083
Now, unless you
want my ship

05:28.151 --> 05:30.551
to consider capturing me
an unfriendly act--

05:30.620 --> 05:33.418
You now see the primitive
fear/threat reaction.

05:35.525 --> 05:38.585
The specimen is about to boast
of his strength,

05:38.661 --> 05:40.128
the weaponr
of his vessel,

05:40.196 --> 05:41.629
and so on.

05:41.698 --> 05:43.097
Next...

05:43.166 --> 05:44.599
frustrated into a need

05:44.667 --> 05:46.100
to display
physical prowess,

05:46.169 --> 05:48.103
the creature
will throw himself

05:48.171 --> 05:49.433
against
the transparency.

05:56.179 --> 05:57.612
If you were in here,

05:57.680 --> 06:00.547
wouldn't you test the strength
of these walls, too?

06:00.617 --> 06:02.915
There's a way out
of any cage,

06:02.986 --> 06:03.748
and I'll find it.

06:03.820 --> 06:05.117
Despite its frustration,

06:05.188 --> 06:06.678
the creature
appears more adaptable

06:06.756 --> 06:09.054
than our specimens
from other planets.

06:09.125 --> 06:11.491
We can soon begin
the experiment.

06:15.231 --> 06:17.199
The inhabitants
of this planet

06:17.267 --> 06:18.894
must live deep underground,

06:18.968 --> 06:21.960
probably manufacture food
and other needs down there.

06:22.038 --> 06:24.029
Our tests indicate
the planet surface,

06:24.107 --> 06:27.042
without considerably more
vegetation or some animals,

06:27.110 --> 06:29.510
simply too barren
to support life.

06:29.579 --> 06:31.740
So we just thought
we saw survivors there.

06:31.814 --> 06:33.042
Exactly.

06:33.116 --> 06:35.050
An illusion placed
in our minds

06:35.118 --> 06:36.676
by this planet's
inhabitants.

06:36.753 --> 06:38.550
It was
a perfect illusion.

06:38.621 --> 06:41.385
They had us seeing just
what we wanted to see--

06:41.457 --> 06:42.719
human beings
who had survived

06:42.792 --> 06:44.054
with dignity and bravery,

06:44.127 --> 06:45.560
everything
entirely logical,

06:45.628 --> 06:48.062
right down to the building
of the camp,

06:48.131 --> 06:50.429
the tattered clothing,
everything.

06:51.768 --> 06:54.566
Let's be sure we understand
the danger of this.

06:54.637 --> 06:56.571
The inhabitants
of this planet

06:56.639 --> 06:58.072
can read our minds,

06:58.141 --> 07:01.508
can create illusions out
of a person's own thoughts,

07:01.578 --> 07:02.670
memories, and experiences,

07:02.745 --> 07:05.009
even out of a person's
own desires,

07:05.081 --> 07:07.015
illusions
just as real and solid

07:07.083 --> 07:08.175
as this table top

07:08.251 --> 07:10.014
and just as impossible
to ignore.

07:10.086 --> 07:11.815
It's Captain Pike
they've got.

07:11.888 --> 07:13.150
He needs help.

07:13.222 --> 07:15.190
If we buzz about
down there,

07:15.258 --> 07:18.022
we may find their mental
power is so great,

07:18.094 --> 07:20.756
they could swat
this ship like a fly.

07:20.830 --> 07:22.525
That entry resisted
hand lasers.

07:22.599 --> 07:25.033
We'll transmit
the ship's power against it,

07:25.101 --> 07:26.762
enough to blast
half a continent.

07:29.772 --> 07:32.605
Engineering deck
will rig to transmit ship's power.

07:32.675 --> 07:35.109
We'll try blasting
through that metal.

07:41.417 --> 07:42.884
Thousands of us

07:42.952 --> 07:46.683
are already probing the creature's
thoughts, Magistrate.

07:46.756 --> 07:49.554
We find excellent
memor capacity.

07:49.626 --> 07:52.561
I read most strongly
a recent death struggle

07:52.629 --> 07:56.065
in which it fought
to protect its life.

07:56.132 --> 07:58.066
We will begin with this,

07:58.134 --> 08:02.127
giving the specimen
something more interesting to protect.

08:20.923 --> 08:22.015
Come on.

08:22.091 --> 08:23.820
We must
hide ourselves.

08:24.961 --> 08:26.019
Come.

08:26.095 --> 08:27.221
Come.

08:29.098 --> 08:30.531
Hurry.
It's deserted.

08:30.600 --> 08:34.331
There'll be weapons
and perhaps food.

08:34.404 --> 08:36.462
This is Rigel 7.

08:36.539 --> 08:39.736
Please, we must
hide ourselves.

08:39.808 --> 08:44.371
I was in a cage, a cell,
in some kind of a zoo.

08:44.447 --> 08:46.005
I must still be there.

08:46.082 --> 08:47.481
Come on.

08:47.550 --> 08:48.881
They've reached
into my mind

08:48.951 --> 08:51.215
and taken the memory
of somewhere I've been.

08:51.287 --> 08:52.219
[ Grrr ]

08:52.288 --> 08:53.585

08:53.656 --> 08:54.782
Ohh!

08:54.857 --> 08:58.020
It's starting just as it happened
two weeks ago.

08:58.094 --> 09:00.255
[ Grrr ]

09:00.329 --> 09:01.694
Except foryou.

09:11.574 --> 09:14.509
A brilliant deduction
by Captain Pike, gentlemen.

09:14.577 --> 09:17.011
Yes, he was still
inside his cell,

09:17.080 --> 09:19.014
but knowing that
couldn't help him.

09:19.082 --> 09:20.674
The Talosians
controlled his brain.

09:20.750 --> 09:23.548
And could make him live
any place, any time,

09:23.619 --> 09:25.416
any situation
they wished.

09:25.488 --> 09:27.513
He would see,
taste, suffer

09:27.590 --> 09:30.855
with the same reality
as you gentlemen sitting there.

09:30.927 --> 09:33.020
Longer hair,
different dress,

09:33.096 --> 09:34.529
but it is you,

09:34.597 --> 09:37.031

call Vina.

09:37.100 --> 09:38.032
Roar!

09:38.101 --> 09:40.535
Or rather
the image of Vina.

09:40.603 --> 09:42.036
But why you again?

09:42.105 --> 09:44.630

Why have they
stopped the images?

12:34.644 --> 12:37.238
Because they know
that Captain Pike is fatigued.

12:37.313 --> 12:38.678
We can reconvene later.

12:38.748 --> 12:40.545
Then they care
about the captain?

They want him back
alive, sir.

12:44.020 --> 12:45.317
I demand to know why.

If you'll be patient,
the answers--

12:47.657 --> 12:49.625
You're forgetting
you're on trial, Spock.

12:49.692 --> 12:51.990
You will answer
all questions put to you.

12:52.061 --> 12:55.030
My answer to your question
would be quite unbelievable.

Reconvening court-martial
of Mr. Spock

and the strangest
trial evidence

ever heard
aboard a starship.

From the mysterious planet

13:24.727 --> 13:27.890
now only one hour
ahead of us,

13:27.964 --> 13:31.331
the story  of Captain Pike's
imprisonment there.

Why are you here?

Are you real?

13:40.309 --> 13:42.174
As real as you wish.

13:42.244 --> 13:43.176
No. No.

13:43.245 --> 13:46.681
No, that's not
any answer.

13:46.749 --> 13:50.412
I've never met you before,
never even imagined you.

13:50.486 --> 13:54.252
Perhaps they made me out of dreams
you've forgotten.

13:54.323 --> 13:58.191
And dress you in the same
metal fabric they wear?

13:58.260 --> 14:00.694
I can wear
whatever you wish

14:00.763 --> 14:02.788
or be anything you wish.

14:02.865 --> 14:06.494
So they can see how
their specimen performs?

14:06.569 --> 14:08.537
They want to
see how I react?

14:08.604 --> 14:11.038
Don't you
have a--a dream,

14:11.107 --> 14:13.632
something you've always
wanted very badly?

14:13.709 --> 14:17.145
Or do they do more
than just watch me?

14:17.213 --> 14:18.145
Do they...

14:18.214 --> 14:19.647
feel with me, too?

14:19.715 --> 14:23.151
You can have whatever
dream you want.

14:23.219 --> 14:25.153
I can become anything,

14:25.221 --> 14:28.156

you've ever imagined.

14:38.067 --> 14:40.501
Yes. Yes,
you can please me.

14:40.569 --> 14:44.471
You can tell me
about them.

14:44.540 --> 14:47.668
How can I keep them
from probing my mind,

14:47.743 --> 14:50.177
from using my thoughts
against me?

14:51.747 --> 14:53.374
Does that frighten you?

14:54.583 --> 14:57.347
Does that mean
there is a way?

14:59.255 --> 15:00.882
You're a fool.

15:00.956 --> 15:02.355
Since you're not real,

15:02.425 --> 15:05.360

this conversation, is there?

16:19.401 --> 16:21.130

beginning to heat.

16:21.203 --> 16:22.500
We'll have to cease power.

16:41.757 --> 16:43.156
The top of that knoll

16:43.225 --> 16:45.659
should have been sheared off
the first second.

16:45.728 --> 16:47.662
Maybe it was.
I tried to explain.

16:47.730 --> 16:50.164
Their power of illusion
is so great,

16:50.232 --> 16:53.167
we can't be sure
of anything we do,

16:53.235 --> 16:54.668
of anything we see.

17:02.711 --> 17:06.112
Perhaps ifyou
asked me some questions

17:06.182 --> 17:07.648
I could answer.

17:09.685 --> 17:12.619
How far can they
control my mind?

17:14.190 --> 17:15.281
If I tell you,

17:15.357 --> 17:17.621
then will you pick
some dream you've had

17:17.693 --> 17:20.627
and let me
live it with you?

17:20.695 --> 17:22.128
Perhaps.

17:22.198 --> 17:24.632
They--they can't actually
make you do anything

17:24.700 --> 17:26.133
you don't want to do.

17:26.202 --> 17:29.137
But they try to trick me
with their illusions.

17:29.205 --> 17:31.696
They can punish you when
you're not cooperative.

17:33.209 --> 17:37.145
Did they ever live
on the surface of this planet?

17:37.213 --> 17:39.147
Why did they
go underground?

17:39.215 --> 17:41.740
War, thousands
of centuries ago.

17:41.817 --> 17:43.682
That's why it's
so barren up there?

17:43.752 --> 17:46.721
The planet's only now beginning
to support life again.

17:46.789 --> 17:48.654
So the Talosians
who came underground

17:48.724 --> 17:50.157
found life
limited here

17:50.226 --> 17:53.161
and concentrated on
developing their mental power.

17:53.229 --> 17:56.494
But they found
it's a trap...

17:56.565 --> 17:57.964
like a narcotic,

17:58.033 --> 18:02.163
because when dreams
become more important than reality,

18:02.238 --> 18:05.537
you give up travel,
building, creating.

18:05.608 --> 18:08.099
You even forget how
to repair the machines

18:08.177 --> 18:10.111
left behind
by your ancestors.

18:10.179 --> 18:11.771
You just sit,

other lives

18:14.383 --> 18:16.817

in the thought record.

18:16.885 --> 18:19.820
Or sit probing minds of
zoo specimens like me.

18:19.888 --> 18:20.946
You're better
than theater.

18:21.023 --> 18:23.253
They create
the illusion foryou.

18:23.325 --> 18:24.451
They watch you react,

18:24.526 --> 18:26.619
feel your emotions.

18:26.695 --> 18:29.129
They have a whole
collection of specimens,

18:29.198 --> 18:31.132
descendants of life
brought back long ago

18:31.200 --> 18:34.761
from all over this part
of the galaxy.

18:34.837 --> 18:37.965
Which means they had
to have more than one

18:41.210 --> 18:42.234
Please.

18:42.311 --> 18:43.903
They'll need
a pair of humans.

Where will they
get the Earth woman?

18:46.215 --> 18:48.149
You said if I
answered questions--

18:48.217 --> 18:51.243
That was a bargain with something
that didn't exist.

18:51.320 --> 18:54.289
You said you weren't
real, remember?

18:56.659 --> 19:03.531
I'm a woman as real
and as human as you are.

19:41.804 --> 19:42.828
Why?

Just to maintain
a supply of zoo specimens?

19:46.275 --> 19:47.708
Much more, Captain.

20:14.269 --> 20:19.707
The vial contains a nourishing
protein complex.

20:19.775 --> 20:21.504
Is the keeper
actually communicating

20:21.577 --> 20:23.044
with one of his animals?

20:23.112 --> 20:26.548
If the form and the color
is not appealing,

20:26.615 --> 20:31.678
it can appear as any food you wish
to visualize.

And if I prefer...

To starve?

20:34.256 --> 20:37.692

the unpleasant alternative

20:37.760 --> 20:39.523
of punishment.

20:59.481 --> 21:03.144
From a fable you

the nourishment.

Because you can't,
can you?

21:13.729 --> 21:16.459
You do have limitations,
don't you?

21:16.532 --> 21:18.466
If you continue

from deeper
in your mind,

21:20.536 --> 21:23.630
there are things
even more unpleasant.

21:44.092 --> 21:45.582
That's very interesting.

21:45.661 --> 21:47.686
Now to the female.

21:47.763 --> 21:48.855
You were startled.

21:48.931 --> 21:50.421
Weren't you
reading my mind?

21:50.499 --> 21:51.693
As you've conjectured,

21:51.767 --> 21:54.702
an Earth vessel did
crash on our planet,

21:54.770 --> 21:56.635
but with only
a single survivor.

21:56.705 --> 21:58.696
Let's stay
on the first subject.

21:58.774 --> 22:00.708
All I wanted
for that moment

22:00.776 --> 22:03.142
was to get my hands
around your neck.

22:03.212 --> 22:04.645
We repaired
the survivor's injuries

22:04.713 --> 22:06.647
and found the species
interesting.

22:06.715 --> 22:08.148
Do primitive thoughts

It became necessary
to attract a mate.

22:12.120 --> 22:14.987
All right. Let's talk
about the girl.

22:15.057 --> 22:17.150
You've gone out
of your way

22:17.226 --> 22:18.318
to make her attractive,

22:18.393 --> 22:20.384
to make me
feel protective.

22:20.462 --> 22:23.829
This is necessary
in order to perpetuate the species.

to you now

22:25.734 --> 22:29.534
that I begin to accept
her and like her.

We wish our specimens
to be happy

in their new life.

22:33.408 --> 22:34.841
Assuming that's a lie,

why would you want me
attracted to her,

22:37.746 --> 22:41.011
so I'll feel love
in a husband-wife relationship?

22:41.083 --> 22:42.516
That would be necessary

22:42.584 --> 22:45.178
only if you intend
to build a family group
