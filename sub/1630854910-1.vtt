00:02.041 --> 00:04.958
IG-11: Manufacturer's protocol dictates
I cannot be captured.

00:06.375 --> 00:07.750
I must be destroyed.

00:10.708 --> 00:12.541
<i>Nevarro is a very fine planet.</i>

00:12.541 --> 00:15.875
<i>And now that the scum and villainy
have been washed away,</i>

00:15.875 --> 00:17.541
<i>it's very respectable again.</i>

00:17.541 --> 00:20.208
You do not cover your face.
You are not Mandalorian.

00:20.208 --> 00:22.208
You are a Child of the Watch.

00:22.208 --> 00:25.583
There is only one way.
The Way of the Mandalore.

00:27.375 --> 00:30.791
<i>Din Djarin,
have you ever removed your helmet?</i>

00:32.333 --> 00:33.416
I have.

00:33.416 --> 00:36.750
Then, you are a Mandalorian no more.

00:37.416 --> 00:38.541
How can I atone?

00:38.541 --> 00:40.333
According to Creed,

00:40.333 --> 00:42.958
one may only be redeemed
in the Living Waters

00:42.958 --> 00:45.166
beneath the mines of Mandalore.

00:46.083 --> 00:48.208
<i>But the mines have all been destroyed.</i>

00:49.541 --> 00:50.833
<i>This is the Way.</i>

03:24.083 --> 03:28.000
I swear on my name
and the names of the ancestors...

03:28.000 --> 03:31.583
"I swear on my name
and the names of the ancestors..."

03:31.583 --> 03:34.791
That I shall walk the Way
of the Mand'alor...

03:35.791 --> 03:38.083
"That I shall walk the Way
of the Mand'alor..."

03:38.750 --> 03:43.125
And the words of the Creed shall
be forever forged in my heart.

03:43.125 --> 03:46.583
"And the words of the Creed shall
be forever forged in my heart."

04:00.208 --> 04:01.416
This is the Way.

04:01.416 --> 04:02.750
"This is the Way."

04:03.416 --> 04:04.708
This is the Way.

04:18.291 --> 04:22.041
From this moment on,
I shall never remove my helmet.

04:22.041 --> 04:24.583
"From this moment on, I shall never..."

04:34.791 --> 04:35.958
Go! Go! Go!

04:37.125 --> 04:39.125
Go!

04:44.708 --> 04:46.208
Young ones, to the cave!

04:46.208 --> 04:47.625
Get back. Get back!

05:00.750 --> 05:02.166
I got you! I got you!

05:04.583 --> 05:05.708
Take cover!

05:06.833 --> 05:08.000
Cover them!

05:09.000 --> 05:10.333
To the sky!

05:25.166 --> 05:26.458
Go

05:43.000 --> 05:44.500
All hands, go!

06:46.791 --> 06:47.791
Get down!

07:54.125 --> 07:57.125
You have removed your helmet.

07:59.083 --> 08:03.208
What's worse,
you did so of your own free will.

08:04.291 --> 08:06.875
You are no longer Mandalorian.

08:10.541 --> 08:12.583
The Creed teaches us of redemption.

08:13.750 --> 08:20.000
Redemption is no longer possible
since the destruction of our homeworld.

08:22.041 --> 08:24.875
But what if
the mines of Mandalore still exist?

08:26.166 --> 08:28.041
All was destroyed in the Purge.

08:29.750 --> 08:32.083
Is this inscription not Mandalorian?

08:49.750 --> 08:51.500
Where did you come upon this?

08:52.833 --> 08:54.208
Jawas.

08:54.208 --> 08:56.833
They came upon it by trade from a traveler

08:56.833 --> 09:00.250
who claimed to have visited
the surface of Mandalore.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.000
Then this relic only proves

09:04.000 --> 09:08.958
that Mandalore's entire surface
has been crystalized by fusion rays.

09:12.333 --> 09:15.375
But a traveler was able to retrieve this,

09:15.375 --> 09:17.208
so perhaps, it is not poisoned.

09:20.833 --> 09:23.458
If I visit the planet
and I can bring you proof

09:23.458 --> 09:27.041
that I have bathed in the Living Waters
beneath the mines of Mandalore,

09:27.625 --> 09:32.666
then by Creed, the decree of exile
will be lifted and I would be redeemed.

09:48.458 --> 09:49.500
This is the Way.

10:02.208 --> 10:03.833
Then I will see you again.

11:42.666 --> 11:44.208
<i>Welcome to Nevarro,</i>

11:44.208 --> 11:47.625
<i>independent trade anchor
and Outer Rim Hyperlane port.</i>

11:47.625 --> 11:49.833
<i>Please state the purpose of your visit.</i>

11:49.833 --> 11:51.458
Here to meet an old friend.

12:04.250 --> 12:05.291
Greetings.

12:05.291 --> 12:09.583
Welcome to the port of Nevarro,
gem of the Outer Rim.

12:09.583 --> 12:12.125
Our esteemed High Magistrate welcomes you

12:12.125 --> 12:14.291
and hopes that your stay
will be a prosperous one.

12:36.708 --> 12:39.166
We invite you to visit
our shops and markets,

12:39.291 --> 12:43.000
enjoy local delicacies,
marvel at the black lava canyons,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.458
or soak in the geothermal springs.

12:46.291 --> 12:48.208
A lot has changed around here.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.833
Do you remember your old friend?

13:21.166 --> 13:22.291
Mando!

13:28.208 --> 13:31.750
I heard you were back,
but I didn't believe it.

13:32.541 --> 13:34.125
Magistrate Karga.

13:34.125 --> 13:37.375
That's High Magistrate Karga to you.

13:38.791 --> 13:39.875
Come.

13:40.541 --> 13:42.541
Let's catch up on old times.

13:42.541 --> 13:45.041
It's so good to see you. Welcome back.

13:45.041 --> 13:47.250
Doesn't even look like the same place.

13:47.250 --> 13:49.666
I know, we've done a lot with it.

13:49.666 --> 13:53.916
The citizens have been so instrumental
in making this all work, and look at this.

13:57.125 --> 14:01.291
We are an official trade spur
of the Hydian Way.

14:01.291 --> 14:02.750
Congratulations.

14:02.750 --> 14:06.125
We've got a construction boom
going on in the city.

14:06.125 --> 14:10.250
The belters are mining the asteroid fields
at the edge of the system.

14:10.250 --> 14:13.000
There's a lot of money
to be made on Nevarro.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.750
I can see.

14:14.750 --> 14:19.916
I can set you up with a prime tract
right over by the hot springs.

14:19.916 --> 14:22.500
You and the little one,
you can settle down,

14:22.500 --> 14:24.083
you can hang up your blaster.

14:24.083 --> 14:25.625
Live off the fat of the land.

14:25.625 --> 14:26.875
Grogu.

14:26.875 --> 14:28.000
Come again?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.500
His name is Grogu.

14:30.125 --> 14:31.625
Oh. If you say so.

14:31.625 --> 14:33.500
Come, I wanna show you something.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.458
Now, as I was saying,

14:36.458 --> 14:40.625
there's a beautiful parcel available
right down here by the flats.

14:40.625 --> 14:45.791
I appreciate the offer,
but I have some matters to look after.

14:45.791 --> 14:47.041
Oh, I'm confused.

14:47.041 --> 14:49.208
I thought you had completed your mission,

14:49.208 --> 14:53.000
but you're still running around here
with the same little critter.

14:55.875 --> 14:57.166
It's complicated.

14:58.250 --> 14:59.541
I completed my quest.

14:59.541 --> 15:00.916
He returned to me.

15:01.666 --> 15:04.625
I removed my helmet,
and now I'm an apostate.

15:05.375 --> 15:08.791
Which is all the more reason
for you to stay here with us.

15:11.041 --> 15:13.375
Where you are from,
you may be an apostate,

15:13.375 --> 15:15.875
but here, you'd be landed gentry.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.500
Magistrate.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.250
High Magistrate.

15:20.250 --> 15:24.416
- Yes, High Magistrate. Apologies.
- Your timing couldn't be any worse.

15:24.416 --> 15:26.750
But it's just that,
there's someone here to see you.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.541
- It can wait.
- But it's pirates!

15:29.875 --> 15:31.333
Pirates in the courtyard.

15:33.291 --> 15:37.166
Get out of my way
or I'll split your circuits.

15:37.166 --> 15:38.458
Oh, my stars.

15:38.458 --> 15:41.541
Stand aside, droid,
don't you know who we are?

15:41.541 --> 15:43.291
Come on, Vane.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.333
That'll be enough of that.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.916
Greef Karga, my old friend.

15:52.375 --> 15:54.291
I knew you wouldn't insult us.

15:54.291 --> 15:56.791
- Come, join us for a drink.
- Yeah.

15:57.708 --> 16:00.333
Let's continue this conversation
back at my office.

16:00.333 --> 16:01.708
This, this is a school.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.708
Well, that explains
why she wouldn't let me inside.

16:09.208 --> 16:14.125
I forgot, it was your cut of my boss's
treasure that built this saloon.

16:16.083 --> 16:21.625
Pirate King Gorian Shard's name
is familiar to all in this sector.

16:24.250 --> 16:28.041
Come, join me for a drink
back at my office.

16:28.041 --> 16:29.708
We'll toast to your captain.

16:30.458 --> 16:32.291
We drink here.

16:34.416 --> 16:36.333
That is a school now.

16:36.333 --> 16:38.333
I say it's still a bar.

16:39.583 --> 16:41.333
Now, bring us a drink.

16:42.875 --> 16:44.833
Is there a problem here, Magistrate?

16:46.708 --> 16:49.166
Is there a problem here?
What do you think?

16:50.375 --> 16:52.250
Not if you serve me a drink.

16:52.833 --> 16:54.791
Not in my school.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.041
You hear that, boys?

17:00.083 --> 17:01.666
His school.

17:05.208 --> 17:11.250
You paid us for murder
and mayhem inside these doors.

17:16.666 --> 17:18.625
Sounds like you went soft.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.083
You think so?

17:27.708 --> 17:28.958
Try me.

17:56.208 --> 18:02.416
Tell Captain Gorian Shard that Nevarro
is no longer friendly to pirates.

18:02.416 --> 18:03.666
Now get outta here.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.958
Get out of here, Vane. Now.

18:24.458 --> 18:26.125
Sure you wanna let him go?

18:27.041 --> 18:28.166
He'll let it be known

18:28.166 --> 18:32.041
that Nevarro is respectable now
and not to be trifled with.

18:37.208 --> 18:39.250
Have the service droids
scrub up out there.

18:39.250 --> 18:40.375
Yes, sir, right away.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.583
I gotta level with you, Mando.
I need a marshal.

18:44.583 --> 18:46.125
What about Marshal Dune?

18:46.791 --> 18:51.250
After she brought in Moff Gideon,
she was recruited by Special Forces.

18:51.250 --> 18:52.750
And what came of Gideon?

18:52.875 --> 18:57.166
Ugh. He was sent off
to a New Republic War Tribunal.

18:58.375 --> 19:00.916
So... What do you say?

19:02.166 --> 19:05.583
You ready to put on the stripes
and collect a healthy stipend?

19:05.583 --> 19:07.625
You'd make a very fine lawman.

19:07.625 --> 19:10.291
Why not request one from the New Republic?

19:11.208 --> 19:15.708
The last thing we intend is to bow down
to yet another far-off bureaucracy.

19:15.708 --> 19:17.791
No. Under my watch,

19:17.791 --> 19:21.875
Nevarro will become
the first truly independent trade anchor

19:21.875 --> 19:23.250
in this entire sector.

19:24.958 --> 19:26.708
I can't serve as your marshal.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.958
I have something pressing to attend to.

19:29.333 --> 19:30.375
Apologies.

19:31.291 --> 19:34.708
I didn't know you were here on business.

19:35.958 --> 19:37.291
What can we provide?

19:41.875 --> 19:43.250
I need him back.

19:45.625 --> 19:48.000
IG-11 was destroyed on the lava river.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.708
This is just a statue.

19:49.708 --> 19:51.791
These are his parts, are they not?

19:52.625 --> 19:54.333
I mean, what's left of 'em.

19:54.333 --> 19:58.125
We were lucky to recover any of his parts
after he self-destructed.

19:59.458 --> 20:02.541
I need a droid I can trust
to help me explore Mandalore,

20:03.958 --> 20:05.166
and he's that droid.

20:06.041 --> 20:09.666
Mando, we've got plenty of droids
around here, we'll find you one.

20:09.666 --> 20:10.875
I guarantee it.

20:12.250 --> 20:13.666
Let me give it a shot.

20:43.083 --> 20:44.291
There.

20:44.291 --> 20:45.583
He's hooked up to power.

20:46.250 --> 20:47.916
Let's see if we can wake him up.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.291
There you go.

21:30.208 --> 21:32.125
IG-11:
Subparagraph sixteen-teen-teen

21:32.125 --> 21:34.833
of the Bondsman Guild protocol waiver...

21:34.833 --> 21:36.125
Immediately produce said...

21:36.125 --> 21:39.250
The bounty is mine.
Asset to be terminated.

21:45.083 --> 21:48.500
Terminate asset. Terminate asset.

21:51.250 --> 21:53.750
Greef!

21:54.750 --> 21:56.250
IG-11: Terminate asset.

21:58.583 --> 22:02.333
- Mando, shoot it! Shoot it!
- IG-11: Terminate.

22:10.500 --> 22:12.166
Now that's using your head.

22:13.375 --> 22:16.000
I think he defaulted
to his old programming.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.250
You think?

22:21.625 --> 22:24.000
That's too big a job
for you to do by yourself.

22:25.125 --> 22:29.541
Fortunately, Nevarro has attracted
the best droidsmiths of the Outer Rim.

22:30.708 --> 22:33.458
They'll have IG back to his old self
in no time.

22:34.041 --> 22:35.791
Are you sure they're up for it?

22:36.375 --> 22:40.000
I don't think I can handle him
with all his limbs if things go scud.

22:40.666 --> 22:42.250
Why don't you ask 'em for yourself?

22:43.666 --> 22:44.708
Who?

22:44.708 --> 22:45.958
The Anzellans.

22:48.916 --> 22:50.375
What do you want?

23:14.583 --> 23:17.791
No. Can't fix. No. No, no. The broken.

23:17.791 --> 23:19.791
Uh... Okay.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.250
The broken. It broke.

23:23.250 --> 23:26.000
I don't understand. Do you speak Huttese?

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Mando, he said he can't fix it.

23:29.083 --> 23:32.000
That's no good, I need this one.
This one is my friend.

23:32.583 --> 23:37.291
It not friend anymore.
Memory circuit broken.

23:37.291 --> 23:39.333
He says the memory circuit is shot.

23:39.333 --> 23:40.416
No more.

23:40.416 --> 23:42.041
Well, put in a new one.

23:42.041 --> 23:43.583
- No, no, no, no.
- Not work.

23:43.583 --> 23:47.208
- Don't make new one. Very hard to find.
- No.

23:47.208 --> 23:50.166
He said they don't make 'em anymore.
They're very hard to find.

23:50.166 --> 23:52.458
- I got it.
- Buy new droid.

23:52.458 --> 23:54.541
This one <i>poodoo.</i>

23:54.541 --> 23:56.416
He says you should get a new one.

24:00.250 --> 24:02.833
Can you fix it without the memory circuit?

24:02.833 --> 24:06.041
Yes, but IG no think.

24:08.916 --> 24:10.708
What if I find you the part?

24:10.708 --> 24:13.541
Okay, now. Then no problem. We fix.

24:13.541 --> 24:15.875
If you can get a new part,
he says he can fix it.

24:16.458 --> 24:20.000
- No! No! No! No! No! No, down, down!
- No, Grogu.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.750
- He's not a pet.
- No squeezie. Not squeeze.

24:23.750 --> 24:25.833
Not squeeze.

24:26.375 --> 24:27.500
Bad baby!

24:27.500 --> 24:29.791
- Oh, he's a bad baby.
- Sorry about that. He's young.

24:29.791 --> 24:31.916
Yeah, bad baby. Oh!

24:31.916 --> 24:33.208
No, Grogu.

24:37.416 --> 24:40.333
(OVER PA) <i>Thank you
for visiting Nevarro, please make sure...</i>

24:40.333 --> 24:42.375
We hope to see you soon.

24:43.458 --> 24:46.250
Keep IG-11 safe
until I get back with that part.

24:47.708 --> 24:50.625
If the Anzellans can't find it,
I don't know who can.

24:51.875 --> 24:53.125
Safe travels.

25:14.750 --> 25:17.666
Being a Mandalorian's
not just learning about how to fight,

25:18.333 --> 25:20.833
you also have to know
how to navigate the galaxy,

25:20.833 --> 25:23.791
because you never know
where you might be headed next.

25:23.791 --> 25:26.250
This here is your hyperspace map.

25:27.333 --> 25:30.541
You determine your range
by looking at your fuel gauge.

25:31.666 --> 25:33.666
And this...

25:35.083 --> 25:37.041
...is your enemy proximity
warning indicator.

25:37.041 --> 25:38.958
Hang on, kid, we got pirates.

25:40.375 --> 25:42.041
(ON COMMS) <i>Avast, Mandalorian.</i>

25:42.708 --> 25:44.666
You can't just sneak away

25:44.666 --> 25:48.791
after cuttin' down
four of my brothers in cold blood.

25:51.875 --> 25:56.541
We're Pirate King Gorian Shard's men,
now you'll answer to him.

25:56.541 --> 26:00.333
Gorian Shard should stick
to hijacking and ransoming.

26:03.500 --> 26:04.916
After him!

26:22.041 --> 26:23.250
Three more.

27:07.083 --> 27:09.291
Has anyone got eyes on the Mandalorian?

27:09.291 --> 27:11.208
Not yet.

27:54.666 --> 27:57.083
Bringing the Mandalorian to you, Captain.

28:10.750 --> 28:12.875
<i>Dank farrik.</i>

28:12.875 --> 28:14.583
They have a target lock on us.

28:16.250 --> 28:19.875
Stop where you are, Mandalorian.

28:19.875 --> 28:21.583
You're outgunned.

28:21.583 --> 28:24.041
I have no quarrel with you, Gorian Shard.

28:24.041 --> 28:25.125
Ha!

28:25.125 --> 28:31.500
What a kind sentiment from a man
who just destroyed four of my fighters.

28:32.208 --> 28:35.416
Surrender your ship
and I will spare your life.

28:35.416 --> 28:37.666
Kid.

28:37.666 --> 28:38.916
Never trust a pirate.

28:55.458 --> 28:56.791
This is Kalevala.

28:59.833 --> 29:02.208
It's another planet
in the Mandalorian system.

29:03.375 --> 29:06.375
And that is a Mandalorian castle.

30:06.958 --> 30:08.000
Bo-Katan.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.583
It is Din Djarin.

30:13.708 --> 30:15.125
I am here to join you.

30:16.916 --> 30:18.500
There's nothing left to join.

30:20.375 --> 30:22.458
What of your plans to retake Mandalore?

30:24.375 --> 30:28.208
When I returned without the Darksaber,
my forces melted away.

30:30.291 --> 30:31.833
Where is the stolen fleet?

30:33.791 --> 30:36.458
Making their way through the galaxy
as mercenaries.

30:38.500 --> 30:40.208
Do you still have the saber?

30:42.291 --> 30:43.458
I do.

30:43.458 --> 30:44.875
Then you lead them.

30:46.583 --> 30:50.500
Wave that thing around
and they'll do whatever you say.

30:51.833 --> 30:54.500
So you gave up your designs
to retake Mandalore?

30:57.750 --> 31:01.333
Your cult gave up on Mandalore
long before the Purge.

31:02.916 --> 31:04.291
Where were you then?

31:06.125 --> 31:09.250
The Children of the Watch
and all the factions that came before

31:09.250 --> 31:11.958
fractured and shattered our people.

31:15.291 --> 31:16.416
Go home.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.875
There's nothing left.

31:22.541 --> 31:24.166
I am going to Mandalore

31:24.791 --> 31:29.666
so that I may bathe in the Living Waters
and be forgiven for my transgressions.

31:32.583 --> 31:33.833
You are a fool.

31:36.666 --> 31:39.291
There's nothing magic
about the mines of Mandalore.

31:40.583 --> 31:45.083
They supplied beskar ore to our ancestors
and the rest is superstition.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.375
That planet has been ravaged,
plundered, and poisoned.

31:51.041 --> 31:52.916
You said that the curse was a lie.

31:52.916 --> 31:54.125
Make up your mind.

31:55.458 --> 31:59.125
If you want to go to the mines,
be my guest.

32:01.375 --> 32:04.041
They're beneath the civic center
in the city of Sundari.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.208
Thank you.

32:08.875 --> 32:12.125
And I will find out
if the planet is really poisoned.

32:17.416 --> 32:18.958
Goodbye, Din Djarin.
