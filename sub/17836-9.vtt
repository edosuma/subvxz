00:00.001 --> 00:02.634
<i>Previously, on</i> Teen Wolf...

00:02.636 --> 00:05.137
Guess who knows all about Mr.
Douglas?

00:07.875 --> 00:09.508
He's a Nazi.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.011
You remember Stiles, and
then a new rift was created.

00:12.013 --> 00:14.279
If the sheriff can do it...
Maybe we can.

00:14.281 --> 00:15.447
But that rift closed.

00:15.449 --> 00:16.648
Then we'll open it again.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.050
<i>By remembering Stiles.</i>

00:18.052 --> 00:19.184
Remember, I love you.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.586
We have to remember everything.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.074

00:34.068 --> 00:35.567
The tunnel gate's locked.

00:36.069 --> 00:37.236
Everything's locked.

00:40.306 --> 00:41.540
Think it'll hold them off?

00:41.542 --> 00:43.075
Probably not.
Definitely not.

00:43.077 --> 00:45.811
You guys aren't hoping I'm gonna
be the optimist, are you?

00:49.916 --> 00:51.583
So, how cold
does this thing get?

00:51.585 --> 00:54.319
Cold enough for a hellhound.
It's not the same as the ice bath

00:54.321 --> 00:59.324
you gave Isaac but, it can lower
your core temperature past

00:59.326 --> 01:00.926
anything a human can survive.

01:00.928 --> 01:03.829
So what does freezing our asses
off have to do with our memories?

01:03.831 --> 01:06.932
It'll slow your heart rate, and
put you in a trance-like state.

01:06.934 --> 01:06.932
Like hypnosis.

01:06.934 --> 01:11.170
Hypnotic regression. If we can
figure out how to work it.

01:12.672 --> 01:14.832
This says "start," so, maybe
it's not that complicated.

01:19.094 --> 01:20.113
It's complicated.

01:20.114 --> 01:24.750
So, optimistically, how much
time do you think we need to do this?

01:24.752 --> 01:27.119
As much time as Liam and
Stilinski can buy us.

01:34.127 --> 01:37.096
Look, I'm not saying you have to like him.
I'm just saying maybe he can help us.

01:37.098 --> 01:40.532
Liam, I'll consider asking Theo
for help when I don't have a

01:40.534 --> 01:42.701
station full of armed
deputies to back me up.

02:05.726 --> 02:09.561
Any available units, this is
sheriff Stilinski. Do you copy?

02:15.301 --> 02:18.770
I repeat, any and all units,
this is sheriff Stilinski.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.572
Respond immediately
with your 20.

02:26.346 --> 02:28.080
All units...
They're gone.

02:35.021 --> 02:38.056
That, that... that's not
possible. That's...

02:40.026 --> 02:41.593
They couldn't have
taken everyone.

02:43.363 --> 02:44.730
They didn't.

02:50.203 --> 02:54.206
Please, please tell me that
you brought the key card.

02:54.208 --> 02:55.841
I also brought my gun.

02:55.843 --> 03:00.212
And your sense of humor.
That is great.

03:00.214 --> 03:03.682
But if we're the only ones left in
Beacon Hills, then we need each other.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.651
Which means you need
me out of this cell.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.352
We need to trust you.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.155
Then you need to get realistic, because
trust is not important right now.

03:10.157 --> 03:12.658
It is us against them. And
you want a lot more of us

03:12.660 --> 03:14.793
considering how many
of them there are.

03:14.795 --> 03:18.630
I hate to say he's right but...
he's kind of right.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.267
If I let you out

03:23.369 --> 03:26.638
and I see any behavior

03:26.640 --> 03:28.307
that I find remotely suspicious,

03:30.510 --> 03:33.946
I'll put so many bullets in your
head, god won't even recognize you.

03:34.747 --> 03:39.151
I'm an atheist.
Fire at will.

03:52.565 --> 03:55.834
You're gonna need to be a bit
closer than that, sheriff.

03:55.836 --> 03:59.104
Wave it over the card reader, come on.
Right here.

03:59.839 --> 04:01.907
Up and down.
You can do it.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.343
Sheriff, we need him.

04:14.721 --> 04:16.355
Tell me something.

04:18.124 --> 04:19.257
What?

04:20.726 --> 04:22.427
Tell you what? What are
you talking about...

04:22.429 --> 04:24.963
Tell me about my son.

04:24.965 --> 04:29.601
Tell me one thing about Stiles
that you remember. Just one.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.803
You swipe that key card, I'll
tell you anything you want.

04:31.805 --> 04:36.141
Sheriff. They
are coming.

04:38.311 --> 04:41.847
One thing.
Just one thing!

04:47.086 --> 04:49.388
He was smart!

04:57.764 --> 05:00.032
Smart enough not to trust me.

05:10.777 --> 05:11.843
They're here.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.679
How close?

05:13.681 --> 05:16.181
Too close.
Too many?

05:16.183 --> 05:18.150
I heard a couple
horses. Maybe more.

05:18.152 --> 05:20.185
Five. I, I think
five at most.

05:20.187 --> 05:23.121
Three of us. Five of them.
You ready?

05:23.123 --> 05:25.857
Wait, are you kidding? Us
against five ghost riders?

05:25.859 --> 05:27.759
We can take 'em.
Five of them?

05:27.761 --> 05:29.061
Three of us.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.429
Yeah.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.207
Ugh.

05:52.385 --> 05:53.785
Two of us.

06:38.698 --> 06:40.065
Keys, keys!

06:41.868 --> 06:43.101
Are you serious?

06:43.103 --> 06:44.169
Here.

06:44.937 --> 06:46.772
Give me another.
Which one?

06:46.774 --> 06:47.873
Any of them.
Come on!

06:47.875 --> 06:49.341
There's a lot of keys here!

06:49.343 --> 06:52.177
I really feel like you're not
even trying right now, Liam.

06:52.179 --> 06:54.045
I'm trying!

06:54.047 --> 06:56.081
No. Come on,
Liam, give me ano...

06:56.083 --> 06:58.016
This isn't even a car key!

06:59.385 --> 07:02.087
That's a small key, that's
too small, too small!

07:02.089 --> 07:04.322
Come on! Okay, here,
take this one.

07:06.793 --> 07:10.562
Whoa! Yes!
Go, go, go!

07:27.213 --> 07:30.182
Okay, it's doing something.
You ready?

07:53.773 --> 07:55.173
Remember,

07:56.342 --> 07:57.809
this will get cold
enough to kill you.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.612
So if something feels wrong
or like, it's not working...

08:00.614 --> 08:02.247
It's going to work.

08:02.249 --> 08:04.983
I hope you're not saying that because
you think I know what I'm doing.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.065
I'm saying that because I
know you can figure it out.

08:14.594 --> 08:19.464
Oh, okay, all right,
yeah, that's cold. Really cold.

08:19.466 --> 08:21.933
So what are we supposed to do?
Talk to him?

08:21.935 --> 08:25.170
Help him remember? Wait till he
turns into a werewolf freezy pop?

08:25.172 --> 08:29.441
We need to guide him.
Keep him focused.

08:31.711 --> 08:37.381
Scott, you have to think about him.
Concentrate on Stiles.

08:37.384 --> 08:40.852
Try to picture him in your head.
Think about what he looks like,

08:40.854 --> 08:42.254
things he said.

08:47.894 --> 08:50.662
I don't like this.
Something's wrong.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.697
Wait. Give it a few
more seconds.

08:53.966 --> 08:56.535
Ah!

08:58.538 --> 09:00.138
I'm getting him out of there.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.306
Wait!

09:08.681 --> 09:10.148
Scott...

09:11.484 --> 09:12.984
Can you hear me?

09:15.888 --> 09:19.324
Scott.
Can you hear me?

09:20.726 --> 09:24.663
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

09:25.932 --> 09:30.402
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

09:54.293 --> 09:57.762
Scott, don't fall asleep. You
have to keep your eyes open.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.297
Trying...

09:59.299 --> 10:04.069
It's not sleep. I think
you're losing consciousness.

10:04.071 --> 10:07.606
And if you do that, I think
we're gonna lose you.

10:08.140 --> 10:13.211
Scott, stay awake.
Scott!

10:13.213 --> 10:16.348
<i>You kissed her, Scott.
You kissed Lydia.</i>

10:25.891 --> 10:28.226
Stiles, please let me out.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.233
<i>It's the full moon, I swear.</i>

10:36.335 --> 10:38.503
<i>You know I wouldn't do
any of this on purpose.</i>

10:40.172 --> 10:42.240
And it's killing me.

10:43.843 --> 10:46.144
I feel completely hopeless.

10:47.747 --> 10:51.650
Just, please, let me out.

10:55.354 --> 10:56.521
I can't.

11:20.379 --> 11:22.213
Where does this take us?
The hospital.

11:22.215 --> 11:25.016
Hospital? Why the... what the hell are
we supposed to do at the hospital?

11:25.018 --> 11:26.885
Hide. Look, we can't
outrun them, right?

11:26.887 --> 11:29.988
I know every inch of that building.
Every room, every corner.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.556
Hide, that's the
best that we've got?

11:31.558 --> 11:33.792
We just need to keep them away from
Scott for as long as possible.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.060
Why? What's
he gonna do?

11:35.062 --> 11:36.995
He's gonna remember.
Remember what?

11:36.997 --> 11:39.798
Stiles. He has to
remember Stiles.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.634
What if he can't?

11:43.869 --> 11:45.470
Then the rest of us...

11:47.640 --> 11:49.641
We get forgotten.

11:49.643 --> 11:51.576
<i>You think you
attacked the driver.</i>

11:54.146 --> 11:57.582
Scott. Try
to find him.

11:57.584 --> 12:00.385
<i>Okay, why is it starting to
feel like you're Batman and I'm Robin?</i>

12:00.387 --> 12:02.153
Try to find him
in your memories.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.989
<i>You have something, Scott.</i>

12:04.991 --> 12:08.660
<i>Whether you want it or not, you can
do things that nobody else can do.</i>

12:09.730 --> 12:11.596
Find him in any memory.
Good or bad.

12:11.598 --> 12:13.932
<i>Scott, there's got
to be something else, okay?</i>

12:13.934 --> 12:13.932
We always have a plan B.

12:13.934 --> 12:17.102
<i>This is just a dream.
You're dreaming.</i>

12:17.104 --> 12:19.571
<i>Why can't you trust anyone?</i>
'Cause you trust everyone!

12:21.607 --> 12:23.675
What's happening to him?
I don't know.

12:23.677 --> 12:26.377
He doesn't look
good. He looks... Lost.

12:26.379 --> 12:29.114
I think he is. I think maybe
it's too much information.

12:29.116 --> 12:32.584
Like, he's getting buried under all the
memories. Being overloaded by them.

12:32.586 --> 12:33.952
So what do we do to help him?

12:33.954 --> 12:36.488
Scott? Scott, do
you hear me?

12:37.957 --> 12:39.791
You have to try to focus!

12:39.793 --> 12:41.392
<i>That's it,
there's no going back.</i>

12:41.394 --> 12:42.393
<i>Seriously don't understand
how you survive without me.</i>

12:42.395 --> 12:43.962
<i>Frontotemporal dementia.</i>

12:43.964 --> 12:45.463
<i>I'll do something.</i>

12:52.938 --> 12:55.206
Liam, come on. We don't have
much of a lead on them.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.211
What the hell are you doing?

13:00.213 --> 13:01.646
Don't! Don't
turn it off.

13:01.648 --> 13:04.082
You want to bring them all here?
Every single one of them?

13:04.084 --> 13:06.618
That's exactly what I want to do.
'Cause if the ghost riders are here,

13:06.620 --> 13:08.219
that means they're
not trying to get to Scott.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.320
So you don't care
if they get to you?

13:09.322 --> 13:10.822
They're gonna get to
all of us eventually.

13:10.824 --> 13:14.058
You! You're going first. That's
the only reason I'm with you.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.594
Because while they're busy
wrapping a whip around your neck,

13:16.596 --> 13:17.662
or shooting a hole in your head,

13:17.664 --> 13:19.497
I'll be running
the other direction.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.766
I'm on your side as
long it helps me.

13:21.768 --> 13:24.102
Trust me, I know.

13:37.183 --> 13:41.252
Theo.

13:43.789 --> 13:44.889
Theo?

13:53.766 --> 13:55.333
Theo?

14:02.875 --> 14:05.276
I'm fine.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.579
Just, just thought I was
somewhere else for a second.

14:08.547 --> 14:09.714
Where?

14:10.115 --> 14:11.449
In a bad dream.

14:19.558 --> 14:21.226
You said you knew where to hide.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.727
Follow me.

14:27.233 --> 14:28.366
No, don't!

14:28.368 --> 14:29.868
<i>You're cursed, Scott.</i>

14:31.303 --> 14:32.770
You hear that?

14:37.243 --> 14:38.610
Thunder?

14:39.078 --> 14:40.211
Maybe.

14:41.609 --> 14:42.748
This isn't working.

14:42.749 --> 14:45.316
Then we have to figure
something else out.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.584
I know. I, I know.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.386
Is he gonna freeze
to death in there?

14:48.388 --> 14:50.588
If his memories don't kill him.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.891
There has to be another way to do this.
Isn't there?

14:52.893 --> 14:55.426
I don't know. This is my
first attempt at trying to

14:55.428 --> 14:57.996
open a dimensional rift
in space-time.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.098
So I'm kind of fumbling
around in the dark, okay?

15:02.368 --> 15:03.501
I'm getting him out.

15:03.503 --> 15:06.104
Wait. I'm not
the only one.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.106
What? I'm not the only one
fumbling around in the dark.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.574
What does that mean?

15:09.576 --> 15:11.276
I think we have to treat this
more like actual hypnosis.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.344
They use images to guide
you through memories.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.046
Like, a stairwell.

15:15.048 --> 15:18.216
The steps take you down through one
year of your life to the next.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.051
That's how they
regress you back.

15:20.053 --> 15:24.022
I get it. So he needs to imagine something.
What do we tell him?

15:24.024 --> 15:26.491
Scott?

15:26.892 --> 15:27.992
Can you hear me?

15:28.928 --> 15:31.396
Scott, listen.
Imagine this.

15:31.398 --> 15:34.365
Imagine you're in
the high school.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.801
Visualize yourself in
the high school,

15:36.803 --> 15:38.803
in the corridor where
all the lockers are.

15:38.805 --> 15:41.406
Just try to imagine
standing there.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.308
That's where your memories are.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.376
They're all in the lockers.

15:46.578 --> 15:48.947
They're locked away
behind each one.

15:48.949 --> 15:52.817
Every memory of Stiles
is in a separate locker.

15:52.819 --> 15:57.889
Scott, you're there.
In the high school.

15:57.891 --> 16:00.525
You're standing there now.

17:02.354 --> 17:05.723
This is your brilliant idea? To
barricade ourselves in the morgue?

17:05.724 --> 17:09.460
The ghost riders go after the living.
So we hide with the dead.

17:12.631 --> 17:14.598
I'm not getting in one of those.

17:15.501 --> 17:17.568
Me neither.

17:18.905 --> 17:21.638
You should've left me
in the holding cell.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.001
I should've left
you in the ground.

17:24.175 --> 17:25.643
Oh, really?

17:26.145 --> 17:26.144
Yeah. Really.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.646
What do you think I
was doing down there?

17:28.648 --> 17:29.914
Just hanging out
with my dead sister?

17:29.916 --> 17:32.250
Having a good time catching
up on childhood memories?

17:32.252 --> 17:33.785
I think you were
rotting down there.

17:35.187 --> 17:36.921
Liam finally gets
one thing right.

17:36.923 --> 17:40.158
I also think whatever happened
to you, you deserved it.

17:41.260 --> 17:42.660
Is that right?

17:45.764 --> 17:50.601
When the ghost riders find us, I'm
not gonna do anything for you.

17:51.670 --> 17:55.173
I'm not gonna help you.
I'm not gonna save you.

17:56.508 --> 17:59.510
I'm gonna do exactly what
you would do to me.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.179
I'm gonna use you as bait.

18:09.788 --> 18:11.255
You still hear the ambulance?

18:12.458 --> 18:14.125
The siren,
can you still hear it?

18:18.363 --> 18:19.697
They're here.

19:06.100 --> 19:07.179
Stiles, you there?

19:07.180 --> 19:12.350
<i>Scott? I, I don't know where I am.
I don't know how I got here.</i>

19:12.352 --> 19:15.953
<i>Hey, this is Stiles and you missed me.
Leave a mess...</i>

19:15.955 --> 19:17.889
<i>This is Stiles and
you missed me.</i>

19:23.795 --> 19:28.132
Lydia, I need your help. I don't think
I can do this. I can't figure it out.

19:28.134 --> 19:30.001
<i>Keep looking.</i>

19:30.003 --> 19:33.838
There are memories, but I don't
know which one's the right one.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.373
What am I supposed to do?

19:35.375 --> 19:38.943
<i>Find another memory.
Just find another memory.</i>

19:55.227 --> 19:59.797
It's getting too cold.
He's getting too cold.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.899
What if it's not
enough to remember him?

20:01.901 --> 20:05.503
What if it's some kind of a connection
he's supposed to make because of a memory?

20:05.505 --> 20:06.871
Like an emotional connection?

20:06.873 --> 20:09.574
That could be why it worked
for Stilinski, right?

20:09.576 --> 20:12.977
He wasn't just remembering someone.
He was remembering his son.

20:13.912 --> 20:18.849
Scott? Scott,
can you hear me?

20:18.851 --> 20:22.019
Listen, I remember something.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.822
At the start of the year, Stiles
was trying to find a place

20:24.824 --> 20:26.657
for you guys to live
after graduation.

20:31.730 --> 20:35.433
He said you were getting
an apartment together?

20:35.435 --> 20:38.936
And I remember saying something to Stiles.
Something like

20:38.938 --> 20:42.106
it's not always a good idea
to live with your friends.

20:42.108 --> 20:44.508
Even your best friend.

20:44.510 --> 20:47.111
But Stiles said
it wouldn't matter

20:47.113 --> 20:49.947
because you weren't
just friends.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.783
You guys were
more like brothers.

20:52.785 --> 20:55.253
<i>Brothers. Brothers.</i>

21:21.980 --> 21:23.848
<i>Scott, just listen to me, okay?</i>

21:26.485 --> 21:28.486
You're not a no one.

21:29.888 --> 21:32.890
You're someone, you're...

21:34.760 --> 21:36.861
Scott, you're my best friend.

21:38.163 --> 21:40.031
Okay? And I need you.

21:45.671 --> 21:48.172
Scott, you're my brother.

21:51.777 --> 21:53.477
All right, so...

21:57.849 --> 22:02.453
So if we're gonna do this, then,

22:02.455 --> 22:05.323
I think you're just gonna
have to take me with you.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.308
What, what's wrong?
Why'd you bring me out?

22:24.310 --> 22:26.210
Your heart rate dropped.
You were gonna die.

22:26.212 --> 22:27.278
We had to.

22:29.681 --> 22:33.084
But then, but then nothing
happened, did it?

22:36.822 --> 22:38.456
It didn't work.

23:14.593 --> 23:16.394
I'm going back in.
No, you're not!

23:16.396 --> 23:18.429
It was working. Something was happening.
I could feel it.

23:18.431 --> 23:20.731
But nothing was happening out here.
Nothing, Scott.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.933
All we saw was you
freezing to death.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.268
You're still too cold.

23:28.573 --> 23:29.940
We can't give up now.

23:29.942 --> 23:32.576
We're not.
It's my turn.

23:34.179 --> 23:36.280
I have plenty of
memories of Stiles, too.

23:36.282 --> 23:38.082
It's too dangerous.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.251
Not as dangerous
as doing nothing.

23:40.253 --> 23:42.186
She'll probably handle
the cold better than me.

23:42.188 --> 23:43.754
If it's all about connection,

23:43.756 --> 23:46.991
then Stiles was the first person
I connected with in a long time.

23:48.627 --> 23:49.960
She'll need a visual.

23:53.899 --> 23:57.101
Okay, I think I have an idea.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.236
But Malia, if your heart
rate goes down like Scott's,

23:59.238 --> 24:00.771
or if we think you're
going to freeze to death...

24:00.773 --> 24:02.106
Then get me the
hell out of there.

24:20.926 --> 24:22.960
<i>Can you see yourself there?</i>

24:22.962 --> 24:24.962
<i>Are you in the library now?</i>

24:26.932 --> 24:29.900
I'm here. I'm
in the library.

24:31.069 --> 24:33.137
<i>Can you see the books?</i>

24:33.139 --> 24:35.673
I see them.

24:35.675 --> 24:40.044
<i>Concentrate on them. The books
on the shelves are your memories.</i>

24:41.079 --> 24:44.181
<i>Everything that's ever
happened to you.</i>

24:44.183 --> 24:47.685
<i>Find the shelf that has all
of your memories of Stiles.</i>

24:49.321 --> 24:53.491
<i>Try to find a memory where you made
some kind of connection with him.</i>

25:13.945 --> 25:15.613
Hey! Sti...

25:17.115 --> 25:19.016
<i>Did you find something?</i>

25:19.018 --> 25:20.451
I definitely connected.

25:26.726 --> 25:29.960
I'm not gonna run. 'Cause I don't
think you're gonna hurt me.

25:31.229 --> 25:33.297
And I think that maybe you're
so afraid of hurting me

25:33.299 --> 25:35.633
because of what you
did to your family.

25:37.369 --> 25:40.804
You want to help me?
Find a way to change me back.

25:40.806 --> 25:43.407
You want to go back?
To being a coyote?

25:44.345 --> 25:45.544
Find something else.

25:45.545 --> 25:47.745
<i>I heard you almost got killed.</i>

25:47.747 --> 25:48.979
<i>I hate this.</i>

25:55.754 --> 25:57.988
Malia.

25:58.757 --> 26:01.425
I gotta leave for a few, okay?

26:02.394 --> 26:04.161
Where are you going?

26:04.163 --> 26:06.630
Whatever's happening,
it's worse for you guys.

26:07.999 --> 26:11.168
Stiles, where are you going?

26:26.284 --> 26:28.586
You're coming back, right?

26:30.055 --> 26:34.458
Yeah. Yeah, I'd never
leave you behind.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.197
<i>Malia?</i>

26:41.433 --> 26:43.200
<i>Malia, open your eyes.</i>

26:46.438 --> 26:48.706
<i>Malia, can you hear us?</i>

26:48.708 --> 26:50.207
<i>Open your eyes, Malia.</i>

27:19.504 --> 27:21.372
Scott, look.

27:24.843 --> 27:26.510
Something's happening.

28:08.787 --> 28:09.887
Hide with the dead?

28:09.889 --> 28:11.255
It was worth a try.

28:27.541 --> 28:28.740
What are you doing?

28:28.741 --> 28:33.243
It's too dangerous. We're not going to
save anyone by freezing you guys to death.

28:33.245 --> 28:34.745
But it was working, wasn't it?

28:34.747 --> 28:36.714
There was a light and
a strange noise. No Stiles.

28:36.716 --> 28:38.916
But I remember him now.
I can see him in my head.

28:38.918 --> 28:40.017
So can I.

28:40.019 --> 28:41.752
He's more real now
than he's ever been.

28:41.754 --> 28:43.754
If we can bring Stiles back,
we can bring everyone back.

28:43.756 --> 28:46.924
There's a huge difference
in being a vivid memory and

28:46.926 --> 28:49.093
an actual corporeal human being.

28:49.095 --> 28:53.931
I know. Which is why I
think it should be you.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.265
I won't last two
minutes in there.

28:55.267 --> 28:57.901
Then think of something else.
Malia's right.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.870
It's all about the connection.

28:59.872 --> 29:03.173
When I was remembering him, I was also
remembering the two of you together.

29:04.876 --> 29:06.916
I don't think anyone had a
connection like you guys.

29:08.213 --> 29:09.513
I saw it, too.

29:10.615 --> 29:11.949
You have to try, Lydia.

29:14.352 --> 29:17.087
Then we have to do it
the old-fashioned way.

29:17.089 --> 29:19.289
We're going to have to
actually hypnotize me.

29:48.219 --> 29:49.653
They're everywhere.

29:49.655 --> 29:50.854
Good.

29:52.390 --> 29:53.891
Really?

29:53.893 --> 29:55.659
You really need me to remind
you that getting captured

29:55.661 --> 29:58.228
by the ghost riders isn't gonna
help you save your friends?

30:03.835 --> 30:05.269
We're both getting caught.

30:05.271 --> 30:06.670
You can do it while
you're running.

30:07.338 --> 30:08.906
I'm going down fighting.

30:44.375 --> 30:46.577
My mother had a hypnotist who
helped her quit smoking.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.713
She had me see the same
one when I was 10.

30:50.548 --> 30:52.015
You smoked when you were 10?

30:53.351 --> 30:55.219
No. I bit
my fingernails.

30:55.221 --> 30:57.921
Just find a lighter
or a candle, please.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.225
Too much?

31:01.227 --> 31:02.759
I got one.

31:10.034 --> 31:11.568
What's that?

31:11.570 --> 31:15.472
An induction script. One of you
is going to talk me through this.

31:18.643 --> 31:19.910
So I just read?

31:19.912 --> 31:23.013
Well, you have to soften your voice.
Keep it relaxed

31:23.015 --> 31:27.484
but not monotone. Go for
clarity, not volume. Try it.

31:30.188 --> 31:35.993
"Take a deep breath
and look at the candle."

31:46.204 --> 31:48.906
"Take a deep breath
and look at the candle."

31:50.675 --> 31:54.444
"Feel the muscles in your
body begin to relax."

31:54.446 --> 31:58.515
"Your hands relaxing.
Your eyelids relaxing."

32:01.953 --> 32:06.356
"As you relax, imagine you're
sitting in front of a TV."

32:14.532 --> 32:19.102
<i>"When you turn the TV on, it's
going to play memories from your life.</i>"

32:23.808 --> 32:29.413
<i>"The remote gives you total control.
You can play any memory you want."</i>

32:29.415 --> 32:33.650
<i>"All you have
to do, is hit the button."</i>

32:33.652 --> 32:37.521
<i>Honey, there's a Stiles
here to see you.</i>

32:41.626 --> 32:43.493
<i>I was just making
sure you were okay.</i>

32:43.495 --> 32:45.629
<i>What the hell is a Stiles?</i>

32:48.333 --> 32:50.667
You wanna dance?

32:50.669 --> 32:51.669
Pass.

32:52.770 --> 32:55.172
You know what?
Let me try that again.

32:55.174 --> 33:00.310
Lydia, get off your cute little
ass and dance with me now.

33:00.312 --> 33:03.981
Interesting tactic. I'm
gonna stick with "no."

33:03.983 --> 33:06.583
"Try to find
a memory of Stiles."

33:08.019 --> 33:11.121
"A memory where you felt
a connection with him."

33:11.123 --> 33:13.590
<i>I'm the only one who
knows how smart you really are.</i>

33:14.092 --> 33:15.892
Fields medal...

33:16.863 --> 33:17.762
What?

33:17.763 --> 33:21.865
Nobel doesn't have
a prize for mathem...

33:21.867 --> 33:24.501
Nobel doesn't have a
prize for mathematics.

33:25.470 --> 33:26.703
Fields medal.

33:26.705 --> 33:29.940
Find another memory.
Keep looking for Stiles.

33:29.942 --> 33:31.942
Find another memory.

33:33.177 --> 33:34.378
<i>Is anyone gonna get me a coat?</i>

33:36.615 --> 33:38.181
<i>Turning out to be
like a perfect combination.</i>

33:38.183 --> 33:39.516
<i>My face just has, like</i>

33:39.518 --> 33:41.518
<i>- I'm not a psychic.
- You're something!</i>

35:17.649 --> 35:19.049
Let's go!

35:21.586 --> 35:23.153
What are you doing?

35:24.055 --> 35:25.155
Being the bait.

35:25.157 --> 35:26.656
No!

35:48.312 --> 35:51.848
<i>Okay, well, maybe we could just...
we could go over there and... what?</i>

35:51.850 --> 35:53.850
<i>It's from Isaac.</i>

35:53.852 --> 35:53.850
<i>What is it now?</i>

35:53.852 --> 35:57.921
<i>She took him.
She's got all three now.</i>

35:57.923 --> 36:00.924
There's still time.
We still have time, right?

36:03.694 --> 36:05.862
<i>Stiles? You okay?</i>

36:11.869 --> 36:16.206
<i>What is it?
What's wrong? Stiles.</i>

36:16.208 --> 36:18.675
<i>Stiles. Stiles</i>

36:22.980 --> 36:24.660
<i>I think I'm
having a panic attack.</i>

36:25.716 --> 36:30.053
Okay. Come on. Come on.

36:33.457 --> 36:36.526
Just try and think about something else.
Anything else.

36:36.528 --> 36:37.827
Like what?

36:37.829 --> 36:39.663
Happy things.
Good things.

36:39.665 --> 36:41.898
Uh, friends, family...

36:41.900 --> 36:44.568
Uh, I mean,
not family. Oh, god.

36:44.570 --> 36:48.205
Okay. Uh, just... Try and
slow your breathing.

36:49.140 --> 36:51.308
I can't... I can't.

36:52.410 --> 36:55.412
Shh. Shh. Stiles,
look at me. Shh.

36:55.414 --> 36:57.314
Look at me. Shh. Stiles.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.681
How'd you do that?

37:33.551 --> 37:35.018
I, uh...

37:36.454 --> 37:39.256
I read once that

37:39.258 --> 37:41.458
holding your breath could
stop a panic attack.

37:43.628 --> 37:47.831
So when I kissed you, um,

37:49.367 --> 37:51.134
you held your breath.

37:53.070 --> 37:54.871
I did?

37:55.640 --> 37:58.141
Yeah, you did.

38:01.646 --> 38:03.380
That's when it happened.

38:06.717 --> 38:08.051
When what happened?

38:15.159 --> 38:18.895
Lydia, what do you mean?
When what happened?

38:26.170 --> 38:27.804
When I kissed him.

38:32.343 --> 38:34.511
That's when it all changed.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.348
Lydia, look at me.

38:39.684 --> 38:42.185
I saw him.

38:42.187 --> 38:44.654
I was there. I was the
last person to see him.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.790
Where? When
did you see him?

38:46.792 --> 38:50.860
The ghost riders, they...
when they took him.

38:50.862 --> 38:52.462
<i>Look
at me. Look at me.</i>

38:52.464 --> 38:53.596
You're gonna forget me.

38:53.598 --> 38:56.900
I won't. No,
I won't, I won't.

38:57.368 --> 38:58.935
Lydia, you will.

39:03.808 --> 39:05.342
<i>Just remember,</i>

39:07.278 --> 39:08.445
remember I love you.

39:21.892 --> 39:24.027
I never said it back.
