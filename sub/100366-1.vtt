<i>Mayday, Mayday, Mayday. Alpha 075.</i>

00:03.320 --> 00:05.215
<i>I'm declaring a fuel emergency.</i>

00:05.251 --> 00:08.964
<i>Alpha 075, what's your current
fuel status?</i>

00:09.000 --> 00:10.881
- _
- <i>295 souls on board.</i>

00:10.917 --> 00:12.557
<i>Current fuel status is half an hour.</i>

00:12.593 --> 00:15.358
<i>We spent too long over France.
We won't make Newcastle.</i>

00:15.600 --> 00:17.965
They've had avionics issues
since the storm hit.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.100
And then the situation
at Charles de Gaulle.

00:20.136 --> 00:21.115
Where is he now?

00:21.846 --> 00:23.698
Approaching Northumberland
but we keep losing him.

00:23.767 --> 00:26.578
- Try Newcastle.
- He doesn't think he'll get there.

00:26.679 --> 00:28.072

00:32.275 --> 00:34.180

00:34.899 --> 00:38.824
OK, Alpha 075, we're sending you
to RAF Coningsby.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.400
<i>We won't make that. We need to land.</i>

00:42.487 --> 00:43.660

_

00:44.781 --> 00:47.709
_

00:50.667 --> 00:52.592
That's exactly what I said to them.

00:52.628 --> 00:54.548
We don't have the officers...

00:56.600 --> 00:57.877
Jesus Christ!

00:59.582 --> 01:02.400
A plane just went over really low
but I can't see any lights.

01:36.341 --> 01:38.339
_

01:41.220 --> 01:42.570
- You're smoking.
- No!

01:43.340 --> 01:45.384
- Why can't you vape?
- Real men don't vape.

01:46.058 --> 01:47.569
Where's your protection officer?

01:47.605 --> 01:50.072
Risk is part of smoking.
Take that out, what have you got?

01:50.108 --> 01:52.713
Lymph nodes! I called James.
He's just coming.

01:53.100 --> 01:55.095
So can I go to the party?

01:55.131 --> 01:57.356
As long as we can video
you millie-rocking.

01:58.152 --> 02:00.797
- You think I don't know what that is.
- He doesn't.

02:00.953 --> 02:02.705
We don't really do parties anyway.

02:03.112 --> 02:06.385
- Really? What do you call them now?
- A few friends coming round...

02:06.420 --> 02:08.800
Yeah. For tea and biscuits.

02:08.851 --> 02:11.199
Well, enjoy yourselves. You deserve it.

02:12.671 --> 02:15.673
I love you. Call me later. Bye, Georgia.

02:16.020 --> 02:19.858
Fascist scum! Sutherland! Resign!

02:21.180 --> 02:23.344
- Yes, make that move.
- Bye, Mrs Sutherland.

02:23.380 --> 02:24.352
<i>Are you sure?</i>

02:24.388 --> 02:26.825
It's been a long time coming.
What about the other issue?

02:26.860 --> 02:28.945
Still waiting for an update from Fraser.

02:29.365 --> 02:31.505
- <i>OK. I'm on my way.</i>
- OK.

02:31.540 --> 02:33.372
I'll call you as soon
as I hear anything.

02:37.088 --> 02:38.088
Dan?

02:38.494 --> 02:41.471
I want an immediate update if
there's any sign of panic buying

02:41.507 --> 02:42.584
at the petrol stations.

02:47.920 --> 02:49.080
Anna.

02:58.960 --> 03:00.840
You didn't answer my letters.

03:10.300 --> 03:12.180
They didn't deserve an answer.

03:14.980 --> 03:16.040
Mum?

03:18.900 --> 03:20.242
Please go.

03:23.918 --> 03:25.826
You don't even want to know
what happened.

03:29.020 --> 03:30.105
No.

03:32.196 --> 03:34.342
Mum, who's this guy? Is he hassling you?

03:34.378 --> 03:35.476
He's just going.

03:43.554 --> 03:46.006
Come on. Come inside. Come on.

03:53.257 --> 03:57.199
_

03:58.255 --> 03:59.471
X5.

04:01.860 --> 04:03.127
And another one.

04:05.415 --> 04:06.598
I'll let them know.

04:22.309 --> 04:24.349
- Anna.
- <i>Multiple X5s.</i>

04:25.895 --> 04:28.068
- Right. Do we know...?
- That's all we've got.

04:28.774 --> 04:31.382
But we've gone from moderate
to significant threat

04:31.418 --> 04:33.063
and we're informing all goal commanders.

04:33.329 --> 04:34.792
I'll tell the Prime Minister.

05:08.774 --> 05:10.858
- Anna.
- Multiple X5s.

05:11.055 --> 05:12.558
We've gone to significant threat.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.625
<i>They could be heading our way.</i>

05:15.371 --> 05:17.470
Convene a full COBRA for the morning.

I've never done it like this before.

06:02.458 --> 06:03.698
It's cool.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.664
I might just drop a couple of downers.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.185
Later. Babe, honestly.

06:09.949 --> 06:11.320
Trust me.

06:11.356 --> 06:14.516
It's like you're riding down a river
on a swan.

06:15.870 --> 06:17.910
It just takes the edge off everything.

06:19.338 --> 06:20.383
Here.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.432
Cheers.

06:37.068 --> 06:40.068
_

06:44.442 --> 06:46.598
- Dominic Knight's on the way.
- Great. Thanks.

06:58.795 --> 07:01.095
_

07:01.855 --> 07:04.165
Hey, Anna. You wanted to see me.

07:13.596 --> 07:15.311
- It wasn't me.
- It was you.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.092
- I didn't.
- You did.

07:17.802 --> 07:19.892
I did an interview a while back/

07:19.928 --> 07:22.802
"What's the most important function
of being the PM's Chief of Staff?"

07:22.838 --> 07:24.276
Do you know what I was tempted to say?

07:25.513 --> 07:28.033
Knowing where the nearest toilet is
at all times.

07:29.178 --> 07:32.269
There's the strategic input, diary
management, controlling access.

07:32.305 --> 07:33.858
But really it comes down to making sure

07:33.894 --> 07:35.660
he always has somewhere to take a piss.

07:36.274 --> 07:39.410
You don't get to choose
your level of loyalty

07:39.446 --> 07:41.116
when you work at this address.

07:43.639 --> 07:46.586
We have a COBRA
on the solar threat at 11.

07:47.040 --> 07:50.426
And you have until the end of the
day to draft your resignation letter.

07:52.244 --> 07:55.647
Can I...? That is outrageous.

07:55.683 --> 07:59.132
You're quite right. You don't need
all day for such a short letter.

07:59.718 --> 08:02.529
Two hours should be plenty.
Have it done by lunch.

08:02.621 --> 08:04.552
The civil servants are waiting.
We should go.

08:11.410 --> 08:12.739
Oh, and Dominic.

08:14.083 --> 08:15.644
You can leave by the public entrance.

08:20.156 --> 08:23.455
Queen takes Knight.
We should expect a counter-attack.

08:23.626 --> 08:27.626
Don't worry.
Got the next move all planned out.

08:36.650 --> 08:39.073
Peter will brief the press

08:39.280 --> 08:41.702
the threat level's been
raised to significant.

08:42.236 --> 08:44.573
All the petrol stations
seem to be working.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.034
There's no sign of panic yet.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.988
Because people don't know
what to panic about.

09:06.396 --> 09:09.089
- Morning, Archie.
- Fuck that!

09:10.442 --> 09:12.442
Have you just sacked Dominic Knight?

09:12.478 --> 09:13.951
Shouldn't it be,
"Fuck that, Prime Minister?"

09:13.987 --> 09:15.763
You should have talked to me first.

09:15.799 --> 09:18.732
I really don't think that's part of my
constitutional obligations actually.

09:18.768 --> 09:21.483
You know how it looks.
Dom's closely identified with me.

09:21.519 --> 09:22.881
Don't go there, Archie.

09:23.177 --> 09:24.560
Or I'm gonna be forced to ask,

09:24.596 --> 09:27.958
"Who gave him the nod to brief
against the policy he helped devise?"

09:29.022 --> 09:30.441
They're ready for us now.

09:30.844 --> 09:33.425
Oh, I'm sorry, Lady Macbeth.

09:33.461 --> 09:36.399
I didn't spot you lurking there
for one delightful moment.

09:36.587 --> 09:38.653
That might work if I was his wife.

09:39.323 --> 09:40.611
Never too late.

09:47.107 --> 09:51.134
So which virtue-signalling ponce
has been lined up to replace him?

09:51.439 --> 09:53.115
I have a couple of ideas.

09:53.466 --> 09:55.812
Francine Bridge was one
thought that occurred to me.

09:59.438 --> 10:01.503
We'll have to have a chat
about that one.

10:12.724 --> 10:15.525
Now, as you are already aware,

10:16.058 --> 10:17.234
this morning,

10:17.437 --> 10:19.619
the threat from Extreme Space Weather

10:19.655 --> 10:21.899
was raised from moderate to significant.

10:22.125 --> 10:24.970
There is some uncertainty
as to the impact zone

10:25.006 --> 10:27.091
but the UK is certainly at risk.

10:27.284 --> 10:29.611
I'll now hand over to
the Chief Scientific Officer.

10:29.736 --> 10:31.754
Yes, as I briefed the Director

10:31.790 --> 10:34.622
of the Civil Contingencies
Secretariat last night,

10:34.658 --> 10:38.180
the Met Office has been
seeing fairly significant activity

10:38.216 --> 10:40.298
on the eastern side of the sun.

10:40.334 --> 10:42.174
But we planned for all this though.

10:42.997 --> 10:45.682
There was the seminar you did
at the Home Office.

10:46.099 --> 10:49.074
What was it called again? The last
bad one, a couple of centuries back.

10:49.110 --> 10:50.183
The Carrington Event.

10:50.554 --> 10:54.884
And a few telegraph operators
got singed eyebrows, right?

10:55.014 --> 10:56.823
The point is though, Home Secretary,

10:56.859 --> 10:59.165
as I'm sure you'll recall
from my presentation,

10:59.419 --> 11:01.711
that our technologies are
much more sophisticated now.

11:01.747 --> 11:04.912
The impact of a similar-sized storm
will be considerably worse.

11:04.948 --> 11:09.433
OK, but it's not a great big meteorite
or the sun suddenly blowing up.

11:09.469 --> 11:10.765
It's neither of those scenarios.

11:10.801 --> 11:13.322
I shall make the Press
very aware of that later.

11:13.700 --> 11:16.345
Be great if we could all
stay on message on this one.

11:16.381 --> 11:19.466
Well, I have a bottle of Lagavulin
with the Foreign Secretary,

11:19.502 --> 11:21.752
this will all go the way
it normally does.

11:21.788 --> 11:25.313
I am sure we are all hugely
reassured by that, Archie.

11:25.660 --> 11:27.449
Now perhaps you could
pick up the threats

11:27.485 --> 11:28.778
in terms of practical implications

11:28.814 --> 11:32.664
just in case the shark actually is
in the water like the last time.

11:32.700 --> 11:34.262
Of course, Prime Minister.

11:34.490 --> 11:37.786
Stage One of a bad solar storm
would knock out satellites,

11:37.822 --> 11:41.067
potentially destabilising all
transport and navigational systems.

11:41.103 --> 11:43.834
I understand that aviation
is the biggest concern.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.132
Yes. There are real worries
over flight safety

11:46.168 --> 11:47.635
after a serious particle blizzard.

11:47.671 --> 11:51.008
But Stage Two is potentially
the most disruptive part.

11:51.223 --> 11:53.428
The storm will almost certainly release

11:53.464 --> 11:56.058
several blasts of plasma into space.

11:56.256 --> 11:57.952
And if one of these reaches Earth

11:57.988 --> 12:00.475
it could cause huge
damage to the power supply

12:00.639 --> 12:04.290
through voltage instability and
transformer damage on the network.

12:04.326 --> 12:06.346
Some areas could be without power
for months.

12:06.597 --> 12:08.344
The National Grid begs to differ.

12:08.380 --> 12:11.305
They think it could be restricted
to a couple of remote areas.

12:11.372 --> 12:15.552
And it could. We just don't
really know and neither do they.

12:16.122 --> 12:20.680
But even one day without power is
enough to drive most people insane

12:20.880 --> 12:23.039
and do huge damage to the economy.

12:23.075 --> 12:26.843
Think of the impact of
weeks or even months.

12:26.879 --> 12:30.004
When are we gonna know whether all
or any of this is gonna happen?

12:30.108 --> 12:33.763
We expect to see more large flares
on the visible face of the sun.

12:34.036 --> 12:36.503
The Met Office are monitoring
for plasma launches.

12:36.723 --> 12:39.328
But even then, it would
have to come our way

12:39.720 --> 12:43.514
and even then there would still be
one critical variable left.

12:43.933 --> 12:46.176
Does the incoming plasma field

12:46.212 --> 12:50.013
have a north or south
magnetic orientation?

12:50.440 --> 12:53.407
- Which is the one we don't want?
- Hot South bad.

12:53.529 --> 12:55.814
Frozen North... harmless.

12:56.112 --> 12:58.833
The probability is absolutely 50:50.

12:59.905 --> 13:02.950
The plasma eruption could have
very little impact at all

13:03.306 --> 13:06.239
or... it could be extremely serious.

13:06.329 --> 13:08.374
When do we know? For certain.

13:08.551 --> 13:11.476
So once released
it could take up to two days

13:11.512 --> 13:14.149
to cover the 90 million miles
from sun to Earth.

13:14.185 --> 13:16.286
But we'll only know if we're Hot South

13:16.322 --> 13:19.727
when it passes our satellite
at the L1 point.

13:19.763 --> 13:22.007
That's about one million miles
from Earth.

13:22.043 --> 13:23.513
Do the math, Archie.

13:23.836 --> 13:25.396
Last time I tried that in public,

13:25.432 --> 13:27.645
Eddie Mair made a bit
of a twat out of me.

13:29.044 --> 13:30.887
- Half an hour.
- Correct.

13:31.230 --> 13:33.510
There will be just 30 minutes
before we know

13:33.546 --> 13:37.986
if this storm will fuse a few kettles
or send us back to the Stone Age.

13:51.346 --> 13:54.721
Archie's face was a picture
when you told that brilliant joke

13:54.757 --> 13:58.256
about Francine Bridge as the
new head of the policy unit.

13:58.514 --> 13:59.976
Great timing as well,

14:00.704 --> 14:02.384
just before we go into
the briefing room,

14:02.420 --> 14:05.397
leaving him no time to respond
to your hilarious quip.

14:06.140 --> 14:09.953
I believe that expression is called,
"What the actual fuck?"

14:10.031 --> 14:13.307
by the young people who've abandoned
our party in their droves.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.640
- You weren't joking, were you?
- No.

14:17.260 --> 14:19.752
- What the actual fuck?
- She's brilliant.

14:19.788 --> 14:22.466
She's unemployed.
Did I mention young people?

14:22.502 --> 14:24.975
- She was a Labour MP.
- Yes, but...

14:25.011 --> 14:27.844
Why does everybody assume
all people under 20

14:27.880 --> 14:30.646
are transgender vegans who
only care about tuition fees?

14:30.682 --> 14:32.909
If you only ever take
one piece of advice from me,

14:32.945 --> 14:35.051
it is never make jokes about gender.

14:35.087 --> 14:37.085
People literally lose
their shit over it.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.579
How about vegans?

14:38.820 --> 14:40.460
Stick to what you know.

14:41.153 --> 14:44.077
Can we not just start moving
replacement transformers in advance?

14:44.820 --> 14:48.505
Have you ever seen a transformer?
They're not small, you know.

14:48.727 --> 14:51.653
- OK. In awe at the size of...
- Absolute unit.

14:51.965 --> 14:53.942
The sun is not going to explode.

14:53.995 --> 14:56.480
There are no fireballs or meteorites.

14:56.516 --> 15:00.401
It is an invisible geomagnetic storm
that could disrupt things.

15:00.437 --> 15:04.362
We have measures in place. Please,
please, please, please, please...

15:04.398 --> 15:07.803
Pretty fucking please,
report this responsibly.

15:08.227 --> 15:10.433
So what time exactly
does the sun explode?

15:11.712 --> 15:14.429
I will brief you again if the
threat level moves to serious.

15:15.441 --> 15:19.401
Move the security meeting with
the Crab back to 11:30, please.

15:20.115 --> 15:24.108
Well, they stockpiled CS gas and
baton rounds for the last false alarm.

15:24.749 --> 15:27.226
Wait, Ed. Don't hang up.
I've got Dom Knight calling.

15:29.233 --> 15:32.011
Dom? Oh, for God's sake.

15:32.914 --> 15:35.107
Are you there, Dom? Good.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.309
Never trust this "hold
and accept" malarkey.

15:38.700 --> 15:40.785
Oh, you bet we'll meet later.

15:40.820 --> 15:43.300
Don't worry.
I'm not taking this lying down.

15:43.864 --> 15:48.549
My daughter spends most of her time
signing petitions on social media.

15:48.585 --> 15:52.390
And my son sings that stupid
lefty chant in the bath.

15:52.517 --> 15:55.300
To them we're still the nasty party.

15:55.590 --> 15:58.905
We hate animals and refugees
whilst favouring tax dodgers.

15:58.941 --> 16:02.085
Our party does contain people like that.
We can't just wish them away.

16:02.121 --> 16:03.907
Or Archie would not be Home Secretary.

16:03.943 --> 16:05.681
Which brings me to Francine Bridge.

16:06.260 --> 16:08.667
She isn't a member of her party
any longer.

16:08.819 --> 16:10.664
She even resigned her seat
in Parliament.

16:10.817 --> 16:12.533
OK, but there's still a massive problem.

16:12.569 --> 16:14.019
- I know what you're going to say.
- No, you don't.

16:14.055 --> 16:17.064
You're going to say none of this matters
because she won't accept.

16:18.352 --> 16:19.908
OK. That is what I was going to say.

16:20.139 --> 16:23.024
It's a problem but not an
insurmountable one. Leave it with me.

16:23.060 --> 16:24.487
I'm meeting her for a drink later.

16:24.852 --> 16:28.504
Met Office has just seen a massive solar
flare with multiple plasma launches.

16:29.499 --> 16:32.961
We need to raise the threat level to
serious and recall COBRA immediately.

16:33.814 --> 16:37.019
So having analysed the data,
we can now confirm

16:37.055 --> 16:40.135
that a high-speed plasma eruption
is heading straight for us.

16:41.257 --> 16:42.338
When does it arrive?

16:42.374 --> 16:44.624
It depends on whether
it maintains current speed

16:44.660 --> 16:45.992
so we can't say for certain.

16:46.028 --> 16:51.137
They're currently estimating
some time late tomorrow afternoon

16:51.173 --> 16:54.027
with a margin for error
of about five hours.

16:54.063 --> 16:57.906
In the meantime we do already have
an immediate impact on planes.

16:58.383 --> 17:00.448
We're getting reports of avionics issues

17:00.484 --> 17:03.530
like false warnings and autopilots
suddenly disconnecting.

17:03.566 --> 17:06.191
Isn't that why we still
have real pilots on board?

17:06.227 --> 17:07.845
It is, Home Secretary.

17:07.881 --> 17:12.089
Although when an Air France crew faced
a similar scenario some years ago,

17:12.339 --> 17:14.359
they hit the ocean 15 minutes later.

17:16.960 --> 17:19.992
The glide paths at two French
airports have failed.

17:20.029 --> 17:22.046
They need to divert traffic our way.

17:22.082 --> 17:24.031
Can't they go to their pals in Germany?

17:24.067 --> 17:26.989
You voted to leave the EU, Archie,
not the human race.

17:30.262 --> 17:32.507
Well, it's fairly obvious
what the issue is here.

17:32.543 --> 17:34.019
Do we ground all flights?

17:34.693 --> 17:39.778
That would have a very high cost,
both human and financial.

17:39.814 --> 17:41.193
Department of Biz is opposed.

17:41.229 --> 17:43.074
I trust you all remember the ash cloud.

17:43.673 --> 17:47.918
If the situation in the air is
manageable and it's Frozen North,

17:48.280 --> 17:50.283
then this is as bad as it gets.

17:50.512 --> 17:51.806
In which case,

17:51.842 --> 17:53.762
we should just wait until morning.

17:56.240 --> 18:00.480
Grounding all flights has real human
impact and indirect danger to life.

18:02.220 --> 18:04.366
This is a hard decision
but we do have to decide

18:04.402 --> 18:05.872
as there's no middle ground here.

18:10.159 --> 18:13.140
Flights will remain operational
until we have more information.

18:13.176 --> 18:14.476
It's the right decision.

18:18.650 --> 18:20.580
_

18:20.616 --> 18:22.665
- Keep me updated on the plasma eruption.
- Will do.

18:23.541 --> 18:25.946
I'm gonna stay here until we
know if it's North or South.

18:25.982 --> 18:27.356
You guys should probably just...

18:27.392 --> 18:29.597
We'll stay too.
We'll take it in turns to sleep.

18:29.633 --> 18:31.871
OK. We could be here for a while so...

18:32.649 --> 18:35.293
I need to pop out for an hour.

18:35.540 --> 18:37.275
Need to make sure Mabel's OK.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.844
It's my dad's dog. Cockapoo.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.680
Staying with me while
he's in the care home.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.387
How is the old man?

18:45.423 --> 18:48.120
Well, he thinks the Home Secretary
should leave the country

18:48.156 --> 18:50.836
so possible early-stage dementia.

18:50.872 --> 18:53.952
I need to speak to the hospital social
worker but I haven't had a second.

18:55.222 --> 18:56.560
Do you need anything?

18:56.596 --> 18:58.601
I'll get some food in a bit later.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.642
- Pizza or curry?
- Pizza.

19:00.678 --> 19:02.197
Something with loads of anchovies.

19:06.347 --> 19:08.213
- I thought for a minute he was...
- Me too!

19:09.909 --> 19:11.803
- Did you ever meet his ex wife?
- Uh-uh.

19:12.446 --> 19:14.867
More Doberman than cockapoo.

19:14.903 --> 19:16.142
He's better off with Mabel.

19:21.300 --> 19:22.510
So will you do it?

19:22.576 --> 19:23.940
Of course I won't.

19:24.204 --> 19:27.657
Doesn't have to be Policy and Research.
You can have any job title you please.

19:28.451 --> 19:30.691
Chief Advisor to the Duchy of Narnia.

19:32.469 --> 19:34.114
What do we really disagree on?

19:34.824 --> 19:37.234
Corporation tax, public services.

19:37.270 --> 19:40.010
The unquestionable
superiority of Western values.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.590
I've seen the alternative.

19:41.626 --> 19:44.426
- Also, you're not your party.
- And you would answer only to me.

19:46.557 --> 19:47.550
I can't.

19:48.668 --> 19:50.873
I got badly burned in the split.
I just want...

19:50.909 --> 19:55.131
...what all normal people want.
Respect. Trust. Decency.

19:55.660 --> 19:59.663
And a bit of help with
the school fees, of course.

20:00.740 --> 20:03.665
Universal credit doesn't
cover that, right?

20:03.701 --> 20:05.621
You are such an operator.

20:09.140 --> 20:10.961
Still getting flak for going private?

20:11.113 --> 20:14.318
Yes. I didn't change
my principles, Anna.

20:14.354 --> 20:17.049
He got threatened with bloody acid
by kids who weren't messing about.

20:17.085 --> 20:19.734
You don't have to convince me.
I believe in choice, remember?

20:19.770 --> 20:23.095
But I don't really. Plus, it's not
choice. It's purchasing power.

20:23.131 --> 20:25.851
That's part of choice
once you've paid your tax.

20:27.175 --> 20:31.062
See? I don't need us to
agree on everything.

20:31.098 --> 20:34.418
I just want somebody who's not
an arsehole and that I can trust.

20:36.294 --> 20:38.426
Ever think you might have
chosen the wrong career?

20:40.160 --> 20:41.240
No.

20:59.222 --> 21:02.427
Don't be fooled, Mabel.
I hate and despise you.

21:03.048 --> 21:04.688
The sooner I'm on my own again,
the better.

21:17.282 --> 21:18.435
Heather, it's me.

21:19.223 --> 21:22.332
You'll have seen in the news about
the possible power complications.

21:23.305 --> 21:26.065
Take them seriously.
Get yourself a wind-up radio...

21:27.660 --> 21:30.620
Plenty of food and water.
Extra fuel for the car.

21:34.551 --> 21:39.257
In spite of your successful attempts to
destroy my relationship with the kids,

21:39.519 --> 21:40.960
I love them very much.

21:43.902 --> 21:46.914
It may be difficult for the next
few weeks so prepare yourself.

21:54.620 --> 21:56.587
The situation is Paris is causing chaos.

21:56.623 --> 21:58.141
They're sending more and more our way.

21:59.379 --> 22:00.760
We're running out of slots.

22:00.796 --> 22:03.466
A couple of flights have
declared fuel emergencies.

22:08.405 --> 22:09.538
<i>...I don't know where I am.</i>

22:09.574 --> 22:11.724
They're still getting false alerts
and losing comms.

22:12.214 --> 22:15.061
Some are getting so confused,
they don't know where they are anymore.

22:15.431 --> 22:17.351
Try and prioritise. It's all we can do.

22:28.433 --> 22:31.505
We are treating this as a
rising tide level of emergency

22:31.541 --> 22:35.701
in so far as we have a level of
advance warning of the threat involved.

22:35.737 --> 22:37.241
But at the same time,

22:37.277 --> 22:40.075
I'm afraid we have very
little guidance from London

22:40.111 --> 22:43.791
as to what, if anything, is actually
going to happen tomorrow.

22:44.045 --> 22:45.127
If the worst does happen,

22:45.163 --> 22:48.160
and we are without power for
a lengthy period of time,

22:48.331 --> 22:50.062
I'll chair and host Gold Command

22:50.098 --> 22:52.300
from the Royal Northumberland
Hospital near Hexham.

22:52.336 --> 22:55.480
Our main priorities will be
maintaining healthcare,

22:55.606 --> 22:57.891
ensuring protection for the vulnerable,

22:57.927 --> 23:01.492
safeguarding key sites
and essential fuel supplies,

23:01.528 --> 23:04.004
while maintaining law and order.

23:04.221 --> 23:06.525
Perhaps our biggest challenge will be

23:06.561 --> 23:09.094
getting vital staff to
their places of work.

23:10.260 --> 23:13.625
Now, you all have a copy of
the civil emergencies guidelines

23:13.661 --> 23:16.986
but I imagine you also
have some questions.

23:17.282 --> 23:19.766
One at a time, please.

23:20.225 --> 23:22.227
How real is the threat
from the solar storm?

23:22.263 --> 23:23.320
Oh, it's real.

23:23.785 --> 23:26.010
They've convened my local
Resilience Forum for the morning.

23:26.046 --> 23:28.514
It might only cause minor disruption.

23:29.025 --> 23:30.514
A good chance of nothing at all.

23:33.030 --> 23:35.475
So a funny thing's happened.

23:35.820 --> 23:37.740
Funny ha-ha or funny peculiar?

23:40.360 --> 23:41.934
When I was reporting in Bosnia,

23:41.970 --> 23:46.115
there was a local translator working
for the UN forces around Tuzla.

23:48.195 --> 23:54.345
His sister was in Visegrad and when
the local Serbs took that town...

23:54.587 --> 23:56.869
..that was not a good place
to be a young woman.

23:57.985 --> 24:00.789
- Nowhere is during war.
- Visegrad was hell.

24:03.447 --> 24:04.834
Stuff went on there that...

24:09.061 --> 24:11.588
It's why I can't tolerate people
who take what we have for granted.

24:14.219 --> 24:15.353
So what happened?

24:16.566 --> 24:20.286
He went to look for her
and he just vanished.

24:22.075 --> 24:23.625
I never saw him again.

24:25.968 --> 24:28.733
- Until now.
- He's turned up?

24:28.769 --> 24:31.894
- Literally on my doorstep.
- Did he find his sister?

24:33.264 --> 24:34.270
I don't know.

24:35.191 --> 24:36.667
We haven't spoken properly.

24:38.744 --> 24:40.465
But you're going to, right?

24:44.336 --> 24:46.025
It was so long ago.

24:49.437 --> 24:52.849
Oh, come and work with me.
What larks...!

24:52.911 --> 24:54.009
Yeah.

24:54.155 --> 24:55.872
That is not going to happen.

24:56.570 --> 24:58.913
There will categorically be no larks.

24:58.949 --> 25:00.365
Yes, there will!

25:00.793 --> 25:03.353
I want a secure videolink to
all police Gold Commanders.

25:03.389 --> 25:04.911
We also need to ensure

25:04.947 --> 25:07.657
that all essential staff can
be brought to places of work...

25:08.913 --> 25:10.107
I'll get back to you.

25:11.224 --> 25:13.280
Air Traffic Control
are reporting a Mayday

25:13.316 --> 25:15.341
from a diverted flight
from Malaga to Oslo.

25:15.377 --> 25:18.573
Up until ten minutes ago it had contact
but now they've lost all comms.

25:18.609 --> 25:20.399
OK. Well, where was
the plane re-routed to?

25:20.435 --> 25:22.202
Newcastle.
They're assuming it's close to...

25:22.238 --> 25:23.619
Well, let's not make assumptions

25:23.655 --> 25:25.656
when it comes to large metal
objects full of jet fuel.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.846
That's the problem though.
It's <i>not</i> full of jet fuel.

25:27.882 --> 25:29.163
They think it's running on fumes.

25:30.307 --> 25:32.862
Get me Bob Jones at NATS.
Patch him over to the briefing room.

25:36.192 --> 25:38.318
OK. Alpha 075, do you want to divert?

25:43.345 --> 25:45.308
Please respond, Alpha 075.

25:46.241 --> 25:49.601
<i>I am declaring a fuel emergency.
I repeat. A fuel emergency.</i>

25:50.029 --> 25:53.509
Alpha 075. How many souls do you have
on board and what is your fuel status?

25:53.927 --> 25:57.252
<i>295 souls on board.
Current fuel status is half an hour.</i>

25:57.288 --> 26:00.088
<i>We spent too long over France.
We won't make Newcastle.</i>

26:00.705 --> 26:03.244
Believe me, Dominic.
I did everything in my power.

26:03.280 --> 26:04.821
I begged him not to do it.

26:06.349 --> 26:08.594
I told him it would
come back to haunt him.

26:09.644 --> 26:10.861
It will.

26:11.492 --> 26:13.774
Served deep frozen.

26:14.436 --> 26:16.961
And that total bitch Anna Marshall.

26:17.207 --> 26:20.487
Well, they were both in
the Tory Reform Group at Balliol.

26:21.941 --> 26:23.765
You were at Christ Church, weren't you?

26:23.801 --> 26:25.197
No, I was at Oriel.

26:26.532 --> 26:28.697
Rumours they had a bit of a thing once.

26:29.225 --> 26:31.824
I mean, let's be fair.
She's a handsome woman.

26:31.860 --> 26:33.183
I mean, you definitely would.

26:39.078 --> 26:42.118
So, who are they replacing me with?

26:43.034 --> 26:45.524
She mentioned Francine Bridge.

26:46.768 --> 26:48.843
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

26:48.879 --> 26:52.524
I'd be surprised if even Robert
lets her go ahead with that one.

26:53.406 --> 26:55.334
When are you going to make
your move, Archie?

26:56.642 --> 26:59.145
Well, you know what they say
about shooting the King.

27:00.717 --> 27:02.898
<i>We've picked him up again.
He's over Lincolnshire.</i>

27:02.934 --> 27:04.596
<i>He won't make it to Newcastle now.</i>

27:04.921 --> 27:08.289
There must be some way, Command.
One of the RAF bases.

27:08.469 --> 27:10.827
- Coningsby if necessary.
- How about Coningsby?

27:11.226 --> 27:15.346
Alpha 075, I have new vectors for you.
Sending you to RAF Coningsby.

27:16.185 --> 27:18.358
<i>No. We won't make that. We need to land.</i>

27:22.335 --> 27:24.397
_

27:24.721 --> 27:25.721
_

27:25.757 --> 27:26.757
_

27:26.793 --> 27:29.948
_

27:31.967 --> 27:36.211
That's exactly what I said to them.
We don't have the officers...

27:38.345 --> 27:39.826
Jesus Christ!

27:40.465 --> 27:43.581
A plane went over really low.
I can't see any lights.

27:44.745 --> 27:46.786
_

27:46.822 --> 27:48.329
_

27:48.834 --> 27:50.327
_

28:06.154 --> 28:07.500
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

28:08.204 --> 28:10.418
<i>I think he's crashed into the motorway.</i>

28:15.316 --> 28:16.682
Fuck.

28:41.825 --> 28:43.351
This is Chief Constable Collier.

28:43.945 --> 28:47.270
We've got an emergency on the A1
just past Newton Aycliffe.

28:47.785 --> 28:50.229
A plane has crashed on the road.

28:50.585 --> 28:52.945
We need to declare a major incident.

29:05.740 --> 29:09.660
Sir, help is on its way. OK?
Help's coming.

29:46.225 --> 29:48.541
Ma'am, ma'am. Help is coming.

29:49.077 --> 29:50.962
Help is on its way, OK?

29:50.998 --> 29:52.596
- My baby! I can't move.
- Your baby?

29:52.632 --> 29:54.352
Wait there. Don't worry.

30:21.994 --> 30:23.219
Where is she?

30:24.185 --> 30:26.265
Do you know? I'll find her. Don't worry.

30:26.771 --> 30:28.576
Don't worry. I'm gonna find her. OK?

30:28.612 --> 30:30.004
It's gonna be OK.

30:32.385 --> 30:34.305
I can hear her. I can hear her. It's OK.

30:43.179 --> 30:45.744
I can see her! It's OK. I've found her.

30:46.505 --> 30:47.595
She's OK.

30:56.560 --> 30:58.520
My baby, please!

31:01.761 --> 31:02.885
She's here.

31:27.200 --> 31:28.263
OK, thanks.

31:28.360 --> 31:30.001
Where in Portugal?

31:31.825 --> 31:34.168
That's good of you.
I really appreciate it.

31:34.865 --> 31:36.320
Yeah. Bye.

31:59.450 --> 32:02.450
_

32:08.160 --> 32:09.649
What does Tuzla mean?

32:09.807 --> 32:12.146
Tuzla. In Bosnia.

32:12.182 --> 32:13.781
Yeah, just you go ahead.

32:16.723 --> 32:19.727
- Not bad.
- This was my favourite thing.

32:25.109 --> 32:26.642
That tastes of being young.

32:27.789 --> 32:29.994
So is the sun going to blow up?

32:30.513 --> 32:33.825
No! Dad's flight's been
diverted to Portugal.

32:33.861 --> 32:34.873
Then what?

32:34.909 --> 32:36.173
Then I don't know,

32:36.209 --> 32:37.672
he'll have to wait until it's
safe to fly again, I suppose.

32:37.785 --> 32:41.305
Funny how it all happens when you
lot fall behind in the polls again.

32:41.341 --> 32:42.446
Hello to you too.

32:42.482 --> 32:44.972
Actually, it's because we're
about to invade Venezuela.

32:45.008 --> 32:47.142
You won't read about that
in the mainstream media.

32:47.178 --> 32:50.057
- They've got oil.
- They're also eating dead cats.

32:51.004 --> 32:54.049
Look, I might have to stay up
in town a few nights this week.

32:54.085 --> 32:56.965
Just until this fake news blows over.

32:57.930 --> 32:59.062
Spoon!

33:02.665 --> 33:03.725
Yep.

33:08.401 --> 33:09.995
Oh, God. Where.

33:11.564 --> 33:13.155
- Are there any survivors?
- Dad?

33:13.191 --> 33:14.898
It's fine. It's not his plane.

33:15.833 --> 33:17.005
Yep. Go on.

33:17.899 --> 33:20.195
So, they're bringing
the rest of the planes

33:20.231 --> 33:22.171
into the nearest
available landing points.

33:22.621 --> 33:24.634
So far no further incidents.

33:25.300 --> 33:27.110
If only we'd grounded the planes.

33:27.348 --> 33:29.102
It would have made no difference at all.

33:29.765 --> 33:31.713
The plane was already in the air.

33:31.987 --> 33:34.920
It crashed because the sun took
out the glide paths in France

33:34.956 --> 33:36.427
or it would've landed safely.

33:36.865 --> 33:39.985
You made the right decision.
For the right reasons.

33:40.851 --> 33:42.911
Funny feeling that's not
how others will see it.

33:42.947 --> 33:44.952
We're not others though, are we?

33:46.303 --> 33:48.216
We're the ones that have
to make the decisions.

33:48.292 --> 33:50.132
While others talk about them in pubs.

33:52.605 --> 33:54.380
Keep me updated on casualties.

34:09.887 --> 34:11.201
Hiya, darling.

34:11.949 --> 34:13.670
Mum. Mum. It's Georgia.

34:13.706 --> 34:15.626
I'm at the hospital.

34:15.661 --> 34:19.608
They can't bring her round, Mum.
She's not breathing. It's a nightmare.

34:19.643 --> 34:22.529
Ellie, just calm down. Calm down.

34:22.838 --> 34:23.929
<i>What happened?</i>

34:23.965 --> 34:27.538
We've been up all night, Mum.
We were taking stuff.

34:27.864 --> 34:29.444
What are you on about?
What kind of stuff?

34:29.480 --> 34:32.400
Oh, God! Mum, it's all my fault!

34:33.368 --> 34:35.328
It's all my fault.

34:35.755 --> 34:38.849
Robert! Ellie, listen to me.

34:39.118 --> 34:42.878
You need to keep it together. And I
don't want you to speak to anyone.

34:44.059 --> 34:46.050
- OK.
- Sweetheart, I love you.

34:46.085 --> 34:47.592
I'll be there as soon as I can.

34:48.176 --> 34:50.096
OK. I love you. Bye.

34:57.207 --> 34:58.392
What's happened?

34:59.796 --> 35:02.810
Ellie's friend Georgia is in a coma.

35:03.568 --> 35:04.568
- What?
- Drugs.

35:04.604 --> 35:06.975
They've been up all night
doing drugs after the graduation.

35:07.095 --> 35:08.045
Christ.

35:09.058 --> 35:11.921
- She's OK though? Ellie's not...
- She's in bits.

35:12.563 --> 35:13.788
God, poor kid.

35:17.649 --> 35:21.734
The Met Office say the CME's
trajectory is faster than anticipated.

35:21.770 --> 35:24.015
I don't have a fucking clue
what that means.

35:24.051 --> 35:25.891
It means I have to reconvene COBRA.

35:25.927 --> 35:28.381
Our daughter is in trouble, Robert!

35:29.221 --> 35:30.266
Look.

35:31.887 --> 35:34.367
We've had a plane crashed on the A1.

35:35.107 --> 35:38.312
We have a solar storm that could
wipe out our power supply.

35:39.145 --> 35:40.827
I just don't have time for this!

35:47.928 --> 35:50.733
OK, I'll go and get her.
Leave it with me. Go on.

35:51.997 --> 35:53.790
I'll text you with any news.

35:53.825 --> 35:56.830
I'll have Peter Mott come
first thing in the morning.

35:57.135 --> 36:00.350
- He has to be across this.
- That would be a really good idea.

36:00.658 --> 36:02.369
Leave it with us. It'll be OK.

36:02.745 --> 36:04.239
It'll be OK.

36:25.485 --> 36:29.932
<i>Accident investigators are at the
site of yesterday's tragedy on the A1.</i>

36:29.968 --> 36:32.082
<i>There has been speculation
that the crash was caused</i>

36:32.118 --> 36:33.488
<i>by a particle blizzard,</i>

36:33.524 --> 36:36.129
<i>associated with a solar storm
and fears are mounting</i>

36:36.165 --> 36:38.488
<i>that it is just the start
of the full-blown chaos...</i>

36:38.532 --> 36:41.100
OK, so we're going to set up
the strategic command centre

36:41.136 --> 36:42.269
at the hospital.

36:42.611 --> 36:45.496
Lot of ghouls are trying to get to
the site and blocking B roads.

36:45.569 --> 36:47.057
What's the status with the survivors?

36:47.093 --> 36:49.787
<i>The pilot did pretty well
and saved the majority.</i>

36:49.936 --> 36:52.390
<i>Current fatality count is 25.</i>

36:52.741 --> 36:55.610
<i>Expected to rise but not significantly.</i>

36:55.645 --> 36:59.777
We have 17 in intensive care,
six of them are touch and go.

36:59.955 --> 37:02.280
The rest are mostly multiple fractures.

37:02.605 --> 37:06.165
We have three burns victims
from cars the plane hit.

37:08.692 --> 37:09.913
I er...

37:11.783 --> 37:14.308
I picked a baby out of the wreckage.

37:15.108 --> 37:17.885
<i>The dad is in an induced coma.</i>

37:18.898 --> 37:21.263
<i>The mum is about to have
an operation on her back</i>

37:21.299 --> 37:23.194
<i>to see if they can stop her
from being paralysed.</i>

37:27.005 --> 37:29.411
It really wouldn't be a great time
to lose power right now.

37:30.038 --> 37:31.289
<i>OK, Stuart.</i>

38:01.813 --> 38:05.979
OK, first things first. Tell her not
to say a word until I've spoken to her.

38:06.725 --> 38:09.396
- Going the wrong way, aren't you, Peter?
- Always, Archie.

38:11.083 --> 38:12.352
I'm on my way.

38:13.473 --> 38:16.028
Stuart Collier's the police gold
in Hexham?

38:16.064 --> 38:18.404
He's good. Young but level-headed.

38:18.685 --> 38:20.741
The main problem is
getting the medical staff

38:20.777 --> 38:22.293
around the road blockage
caused by the plane.

38:22.329 --> 38:23.279
OK.

38:29.990 --> 38:30.975
Yep.

38:31.365 --> 38:33.125
Where's the Prime Minister?

38:34.378 --> 38:36.333
He's on his way over from No.10.

38:36.913 --> 38:38.917
A word to the wise, Anna.

38:38.953 --> 38:41.553
As you know,
I have the highest admiration for you.

38:41.589 --> 38:42.588
Get on with it.

38:43.427 --> 38:45.331
I don't care how far you two go back

38:45.367 --> 38:47.715
or how much you feel the
party needs a makeover.

38:47.751 --> 38:50.942
Put Francine Bridge in the policy
unit, even making the coffee,

38:50.978 --> 38:54.367
and I will give you a lesson in
payback you will not forget in a hurry.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.163
Thanks, Archie.

38:56.199 --> 38:59.172
And in a similar spirit, get your hand
off my arm and back the fuck off.

38:59.803 --> 39:03.116
I'm not some little volunteer you can
get handsy with on the battle bus.

39:05.054 --> 39:07.134
You just crossed a line, Anna.

39:10.059 --> 39:12.384
When he goes, which will be sooner
than you think,

39:12.420 --> 39:16.065
he will at least be able to do some
lucrative after-dinner speaking.

39:16.101 --> 39:18.581
<i>You</i> won't be able
to get yourself arrested.

39:20.810 --> 39:24.530
I am feeling both positive
and patriotic this morning.

39:24.566 --> 39:26.783
I've got a feeling I'm
going to be a bottle of Scotch

39:26.819 --> 39:28.696
to the good by the end of this meeting.

39:30.037 --> 39:31.591
Better find out, hadn't we?

39:36.035 --> 39:39.729
There are two possible impacts
on the grid when the storm hits.

39:39.765 --> 39:41.795
The first is voltage instability.

39:42.289 --> 39:46.469
Now, we need that to
stay running at 50 Hertz.

39:46.536 --> 39:49.971
If it goes a couple of points above
or below we'll start getting trips.

39:50.513 --> 39:53.438
The other problem is burn-out damage
to transformers

39:53.614 --> 39:56.110
if the power from the storm surges
into the network.

39:56.146 --> 40:00.666
<i>OK, Prime Minister. We're pretty
close to getting the orientation now.</i>

40:06.005 --> 40:09.565
<i>We're getting the data from
the satellite position at L1.</i>

40:15.282 --> 40:18.785
<i>I'm afraid the news is not what
we were hoping for, Prime Minister.</i>

40:18.934 --> 40:22.820
<i>We can expect a massive geomagnetic
stormsurge in the coming hours.</i>

40:22.856 --> 40:24.087
<i>It's Hot South.</i>

40:26.164 --> 40:28.405
There goes my Lagavulin.

40:29.765 --> 40:32.485
- Upgrade threat level to critical.
- Here comes the sun.

40:37.309 --> 40:40.177
<i>A major incident has been
declared in this hospital.</i>

40:40.213 --> 40:42.218
<i>We are receiving multiple casualties.</i>

40:42.254 --> 40:44.890
<i>Non-urgent cases will not be seen.</i>

40:44.926 --> 40:48.011
<i>Await instructions on transfers
to other sites.</i>

40:48.259 --> 40:50.179
<i>Thank you for your patience.</i>

41:07.923 --> 41:09.143
Bollocks.

41:09.685 --> 41:10.922
That's not good.

41:20.603 --> 41:23.606
The emergency generators are
detecting the voltage instability.

41:23.642 --> 41:26.807
Do we have a direct link to the
National Grid command centre?

41:26.843 --> 41:29.043
I think they're a bit busy
down there right now.

41:31.024 --> 41:35.434
OK, er, early evidence is that
coastal areas have taken a massive hit

41:35.725 --> 41:36.934
and this is just the start.

41:36.970 --> 41:39.351
The surges will just keep
coming like tsunamis.

41:39.394 --> 41:43.109
- What about the rest of the world?
- No clear picture as yet.

41:43.219 --> 41:44.781
Although early reports say

41:44.817 --> 41:48.819
that France and Spain are
almost totally blacked out.

41:49.370 --> 41:52.378
Three transformers are out already
and that is set to rise.

41:52.414 --> 41:54.650
The entire system is on
the brink of collapse

41:54.686 --> 41:57.611
and blackouts are now imminent
across all major cities.

41:57.796 --> 42:00.761
I am sorry to say that
the power of this storm

42:00.797 --> 42:03.298
is far worse than even
our most pessimistic forecast.

42:06.229 --> 42:07.828
I will now speak to the Palace

42:07.864 --> 42:10.155
so that Her Majesty can
authorise the necessary powers

42:10.191 --> 42:12.859
under the 2004 Civil Contingencies Act.

42:14.298 --> 42:16.105
This is now a national emergency

42:16.805 --> 42:19.231
and COBRA will remain active
until its conclusion.

42:34.394 --> 42:35.582
Anna, it's me.

42:35.706 --> 42:37.638
I've been giving it some thought.
Call me back.
