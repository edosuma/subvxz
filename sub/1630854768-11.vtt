WEBVTT

00:02.578 --> 00:04.578
Well, we're so glad
to finally meet you, Leigh Ann.

00:04.654 --> 00:07.172
I mean, Wyatt's been
talkin' you up so much,

00:07.249 --> 00:09.082
I started to wonder
if you really existed.

00:09.235 --> 00:10.400
-WYATT: Oh.
-Uh, no, we didn't.

00:10.402 --> 00:12.252
JUDD RYDER:
Well, I did. All I heard was,

00:12.404 --> 00:14.421
"Oh, Leigh Ann
from Introduction to Psych."

00:14.498 --> 00:17.407
It started to sound like,
"Yeah, my girlfriend

00:17.409 --> 00:19.243
-from Canada," you know?
-(group laughing)

00:19.261 --> 00:21.245
Thanks,
Dad, I appreciate that.

00:21.247 --> 00:22.688
Okay, so, you two,

00:22.839 --> 00:27.842
I don't think I actually heard
the story of how you met, so...

00:27.862 --> 00:29.844
-Oh. Well, you want to?
-No, no.

00:29.864 --> 00:31.030
You, you go ahead.

00:31.181 --> 00:32.847
WYATT:
Alright, well, I...

00:32.867 --> 00:33.940
(laughs) I just get home

00:34.093 --> 00:35.425
from a party one Friday night,

00:35.444 --> 00:38.871
and I find that my roommate
has totally sexiled me.

00:39.022 --> 00:40.097
He what now?

00:40.099 --> 00:42.875
-He what?
-Uh, he...

00:43.026 --> 00:44.451
He reserved the room for,

00:44.528 --> 00:46.119
for some girl
he was having over.

00:46.272 --> 00:47.195
-GRACE: Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

00:47.273 --> 00:50.123
So I went to the common room,

00:50.276 --> 00:52.534
and there she was.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.887
With her
noise-canceling headphones,

00:55.038 --> 00:56.296
chewing on her highlighter.

00:56.448 --> 01:00.133
Anyway, he walked in
looking like a lost puppy

01:00.210 --> 01:04.229
and, um, well, then we
started talking and...

01:04.306 --> 01:06.065
we never really stopped.

01:06.216 --> 01:07.232
Hey, when you know...

01:07.309 --> 01:09.234
-GRACE: Mm.
-Aah.

01:09.311 --> 01:12.220
-...you just know.
-(both chuckling)

01:12.239 --> 01:14.239
Okay, so, Miss Leigh Ann,
what are you studying?

01:14.391 --> 01:17.367
I am an early education major.

01:17.970 --> 01:18.969
You wanna teach?

01:18.971 --> 01:20.412
That's all
I've ever wanted to do.

01:20.564 --> 01:25.417
Leigh Ann actually has a 4.0.
Even after mid-terms.

01:25.569 --> 01:27.644
Mid-terms? Man, I--

01:27.646 --> 01:30.814
I didn't even realize
the midterms came and went.

01:30.816 --> 01:31.924
How'd you fare?

01:32.075 --> 01:34.426
I... I didn't.

01:34.578 --> 01:35.594
I didn't take them.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.429
Well, why not?

01:38.432 --> 01:42.250
Because I am
dropping out of school.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.919
No, you ain't dropping out
of no damn school.

01:44.997 --> 01:45.938
GRACE:
Hold on, sweetheart.

01:46.089 --> 01:47.755
Let's, let's calm down.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.015
Um...

01:49.092 --> 01:51.017
Wyatt, you know that

01:51.094 --> 01:53.019
if it's your course load...

01:53.096 --> 01:55.188
(sighs)
...that you can just,

01:55.341 --> 01:56.356
you can drop some

01:56.433 --> 01:58.433
and then pick them up
at a later time.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.677
WYATT:
Yeah, it's not that,
you know, I, uh...

02:00.696 --> 02:03.789
I don't really need a degree
for, for what I wanna do.

02:03.940 --> 02:06.683
What do you wanna do exactly?

02:06.685 --> 02:07.668
You wanna be a bum?

02:08.854 --> 02:10.379
A firefighter.

02:21.458 --> 02:22.432
A firefighter.

02:25.554 --> 02:27.295
In fact, I was wondering
if you could call the chief,

02:27.373 --> 02:29.148
maybe put in a word for me.

02:30.151 --> 02:31.466
Oh, you want me
to call the chief,

02:31.543 --> 02:33.560
the chief of the Austin
Fire Department for you?

02:33.712 --> 02:35.136
-Uh, yeah.
-JUDD: Yeah.

02:35.305 --> 02:37.639
WYATT:
I missed the application
deadline for spring session,

02:37.716 --> 02:40.550
so maybe if you just reached out
he could...

02:40.569 --> 02:41.743
he could make an exception.

02:43.813 --> 02:45.372
What's the damn rush?

02:46.167 --> 02:49.001
Uh, we kinda need the money.

02:49.986 --> 02:51.378
You need the money?

02:52.247 --> 02:53.380
Why?

02:54.824 --> 02:57.759
We are having a baby.

02:59.162 --> 03:00.470
(Wyatt sighs)

03:01.998 --> 03:03.348
(Judd sucks teeth)

03:05.093 --> 03:08.437
(theme music plays)

03:10.098 --> 03:11.748
-MATEO CHAVEZ: Ooh!
-NANCY GILLIAN: And seven!

03:11.767 --> 03:13.174
I'm gonna put this right here.

03:13.343 --> 03:15.101
-There you go, baby.
-And I'm gonna take
this from you.

03:15.254 --> 03:16.344
-Ha, ha. That's my baby.
-Ooh.

03:16.363 --> 03:19.531
MARJAN MARWANI:
Alright, fun time is over.

03:19.683 --> 03:21.608
I have made a list of chores

03:21.685 --> 03:23.368
and printed them
in order of priority.

03:23.520 --> 03:26.096
How is it you're the one
that was shot

03:26.114 --> 03:27.447
but we're the ones suffering?

03:27.449 --> 03:29.449
Seriously, we need to
get you back in the field.

03:29.601 --> 03:32.044
From your lips
to my physical therapist's ears.

03:32.120 --> 03:33.453
Now, would you rather
draw straws

03:33.605 --> 03:35.047
or have me dole out assignments?

03:35.198 --> 03:36.381
-And these are our choices?
-MARJAN: Yes.

03:36.533 --> 03:38.533
-Hold that thought.
-(cell phone ringing)

03:38.610 --> 03:39.384
Hey, cuz!

03:39.778 --> 03:41.202
MAN (over phone):
<i> Yo! What's up, cuz?</i>

03:41.222 --> 03:42.629
Yo, say hi to the crew.

03:42.781 --> 03:44.473
<i> Yo, what's up, crew?</i>

03:46.118 --> 03:47.059
That's hilarious, Mateo.

03:47.210 --> 03:49.210
Now, can we please
get back to work?

03:49.230 --> 03:50.712
<i> What's hilarious?</i>

03:50.731 --> 03:52.138
I don't know.

03:52.291 --> 03:53.232
I'm sorry. Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

03:53.308 --> 03:54.399
Is that a real
whole 'nother person?

03:54.551 --> 03:56.884
Yeah, this is
my cousin from Cali. Marvin.

03:56.962 --> 03:58.128
That's your twin?

03:58.221 --> 04:00.313
-No, not twin. Identical cousin.
-TK STRAND: What?

04:00.390 --> 04:02.299
No, that is not a real thing.

04:02.392 --> 04:03.800
Yeah, sure it is.
You never seen Nick at Nite?

04:03.819 --> 04:06.578
<i> Well, I mean, I wouldn't</i>
<i> call us identical cousins,</i>

04:06.580 --> 04:08.472
<i> 'cause, you know,</i>
<i> I'm better looking.</i>

04:08.474 --> 04:09.915
MATEO:
Yeah, you wish, Marvin.

04:10.142 --> 04:12.325
Hey, check this out.
This is Nancy.

04:12.478 --> 04:15.587
<i>Oh, this was the shorty</i>
<i>that you were telling me about?</i>

04:15.739 --> 04:17.147
She's my tall shorty.

04:17.149 --> 04:19.499
Um, hi.
It's so nice to meet you.

04:19.576 --> 04:22.335
<i> Damn! You really punching</i>
<i> above your weight, huh, cuz?</i>

04:22.412 --> 04:24.337
Yeah, I can't argue that.
(chuckles)

04:24.490 --> 04:26.172
<i> Listen, I'd love to chat,</i>

04:26.249 --> 04:28.767
<i> but, um, this isn't</i>
<i> exactly a social call.</i>

04:28.918 --> 04:30.251
-Oh. Oh, okay.
-Oh.

04:30.271 --> 04:33.513
Uh, yeah, hold on.
I'll-I'll be right back.

04:33.665 --> 04:35.999
Okay. I'm alone now, cuz.

04:36.018 --> 04:37.017
What's up? (clears throat)

04:37.169 --> 04:39.093
<i> Look, I'm not gonna lie.</i>

04:39.113 --> 04:40.261
<i> I'm in a bit of a jam, cuz.</i>

04:40.281 --> 04:42.656
Hmm. Well, how bad
are we talking?

04:43.600 --> 04:44.491
(sighs)

04:45.602 --> 04:48.178
<i> Baggy jumpsuit</i>
<i> and no shoelaces bad.</i>

04:48.180 --> 04:49.863
Dude, you're locked up again?

04:49.939 --> 04:52.291
MARVIN:
<i> Well, hey, you know wearing</i>
<i> orange is not by choice.</i>

04:52.293 --> 04:53.533
(Mateo mutters)
Wait a minute.

04:53.610 --> 04:55.368
If you're in jail,
how are you on the phone?

04:55.445 --> 04:58.088
(clicks tongue)<i> Come on.</i>
<i> You know who you talking to?</i>

04:59.541 --> 05:01.949
Alright, so what are you
in for this time?

05:02.027 --> 05:03.468
(sighs)<i> Well...</i>

05:03.620 --> 05:05.453
<i> Just a little GTA,</i>

05:05.531 --> 05:07.139
<i> which I'm sure</i>
<i> won't even stick.</i>

05:07.290 --> 05:10.200
<i> And, um, leaving</i>
<i> the scene of an accident</i>

05:10.202 --> 05:11.959
<i> and evading arrest.</i>

05:11.979 --> 05:13.628
So you were joyriding again?

05:13.705 --> 05:15.555
Dude, you swore that you
were done with that crap.

05:15.707 --> 05:18.299
<i> Hey, whatever happened to</i>
<i> innocent until proven guilty?</i>

05:18.319 --> 05:20.877
<i> Look, it was all just</i>
<i> a huge misunderstanding.</i>

05:20.879 --> 05:23.380
<i> See, I decided to take</i>
<i> the long way around the block</i>

05:23.398 --> 05:25.549
<i> while I was working valet</i>
<i> in some dude's Ferrari.</i>

05:25.551 --> 05:28.493
<i>And it wasn't my fault</i>
<i>that the minivan stopped short.</i>

05:29.813 --> 05:31.145
So how much do you need?

05:31.165 --> 05:33.999
<i> Well, bail's set at 25 Gs.</i>

05:34.076 --> 05:35.625
Twenty-five-- Oh!

05:37.821 --> 05:39.004
(sighs)

05:39.081 --> 05:40.413
Dude, 25 Gs?

05:40.566 --> 05:41.898
I mean, I don't have
that kinda money

05:41.917 --> 05:43.008
just laying around, man.

05:43.085 --> 05:44.492
Have you talked to
Aunt Marisol about this?

05:44.511 --> 05:46.920
<i> No. No, no, no, no. No way.</i>

05:47.072 --> 05:48.162
<i> I ain't gonna tell Mom</i>
<i> about this.</i>

05:48.182 --> 05:49.239
<i> She would freak out.</i>

05:49.241 --> 05:50.849
<i> I need you to find it for me.</i>

05:51.000 --> 05:51.925
I mean, it's kind of a big ask.

05:52.077 --> 05:53.743
<i> Yeah, well, desperate times.</i>

05:53.762 --> 05:56.480
<i> Look, I need you</i>
<i> to come through</i>
<i> and help a cousin out.</i>

05:58.859 --> 06:00.233
(sighs)

06:00.919 --> 06:01.843
Alright.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.010
Let me see what I can do, cuz.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.938
<i> That's my cuz!</i>

I'm not gonna calm down

08:29.993 --> 08:31.468
Here we go.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.998
This is the last thing
your demon spawn

08:37.017 --> 08:38.332
ever send over that fence.

08:38.410 --> 08:40.260
I'm gonna sue you
out of house and home.

08:40.412 --> 08:42.354
Ma'am, words cannot express

08:42.505 --> 08:46.082
how critical it is for you
to just be still.

08:46.084 --> 08:47.359
-Nance?
-BP is rock solid.

08:47.435 --> 08:48.918
TK:
So is her breathing, Cap.

08:48.937 --> 08:49.936
NANCY:
How is that possible?

08:50.030 --> 08:51.271
She's made of stone.

08:51.423 --> 08:53.406
Okay, sir, I'm gonna
ask you to come back here.

08:54.684 --> 08:57.610
Ma'am, do you feel
any numbness or tingling?

08:57.687 --> 08:58.662
No.

09:01.190 --> 09:04.376
(suspenseful music playing)

09:04.603 --> 09:06.786
Ma'am, when's the last time
you saw a doctor?

09:06.863 --> 09:08.605
(scoffs) I don't do doctors.

09:08.623 --> 09:10.790
If there's nothing
wrong with you when you go in,

09:10.942 --> 09:12.551
there will be when you come out.

09:12.627 --> 09:16.972
Alright, Well, I think
it's time you give one a shot.

09:17.391 --> 09:18.448
Um...

09:18.541 --> 09:20.283
the reason
this arrow didn't kill you

09:20.285 --> 09:23.061
is because something kept it
from hitting your carotid.

09:24.122 --> 09:26.047
I'm feeling a mass.

09:26.141 --> 09:28.291
I think it's a tumor.

09:28.293 --> 09:32.237
A-a tumor?
As in a cancer tumor?

09:32.388 --> 09:34.555
Well, you need to
see a doctor to be sure.

09:34.575 --> 09:38.134
But given where it is,
it's, uh, it's highly likely.

09:38.136 --> 09:40.136
Am I gonna die?

09:40.138 --> 09:42.472
Actually, if you
get it treated,

09:42.490 --> 09:44.324
chances are
you'll be just fine.

09:44.476 --> 09:46.918
But I wouldn't
let it go much longer.

09:47.070 --> 09:50.237
So the cancer
just saved my life?

09:50.315 --> 09:53.333
I think... those boys
saved your life

09:53.409 --> 09:55.985
by pointing an arrow
right at the problem.

09:55.987 --> 09:57.912
Nancy, keep an eye
on her vitals.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.413
TK, let's secure the arrow.

09:59.433 --> 10:00.657
-Wrap some Kerlix around it.
-TK: Copy.

10:00.659 --> 10:02.559
TOMMY VEGA:
Get her ready for travel.

10:03.829 --> 10:06.313
(light music playing)

10:08.758 --> 10:11.067
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Please stop, please stop.

10:12.095 --> 10:13.612
We're sorry.

10:13.763 --> 10:15.614
I'm... I'm sorry, too.

10:16.450 --> 10:18.265
-Officer?
-Yep.

10:18.267 --> 10:21.102
There's a large bin
in my backyard.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.604
-Would you see to it
that these boys get it?
-Sure.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.290
And, uh, would you
make sure that all
the neighborhood children

10:25.441 --> 10:27.851
get back anything
that belongs to them?

10:27.869 --> 10:29.352
You mean it?

10:29.371 --> 10:33.114
Yes. And when you next
hit something into my backyard,

10:33.133 --> 10:34.524
when you come to get it,

10:34.526 --> 10:36.593
would you stay
for a glass of juice?

10:38.864 --> 10:40.472
We can do that.

10:41.700 --> 10:42.599
Alright.

10:43.644 --> 10:44.726
(ambulance engine starts)

10:47.389 --> 10:50.357
â™ªâ™ª

10:55.656 --> 10:58.448
Well, I guess
she's not pressing charges.

10:59.067 --> 11:01.142
Or her luck.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.994
WINSTON CHURCHILL
(over headphones):
<i> If we can stand up to him,</i>

11:03.071 --> 11:05.646
<i> all Europe may be freed</i>

11:05.724 --> 11:09.984
<i> and the life of the world</i>
<i> may move forward into broad...</i>

11:10.061 --> 11:12.170
Cap, got a second?

11:12.247 --> 11:15.006
I'm listening to Churchill's
"Finest Hour" speech.

11:15.158 --> 11:16.582
(chuckles) For fun?

11:16.659 --> 11:18.401
Uh, no, I'm looking
for inspiration

11:18.420 --> 11:20.086
for my toast at TK's wedding.

11:20.238 --> 11:21.179
Quotable is quotable.

11:21.330 --> 11:23.181
Ha, ha. I wouldn't
worry about it too much.

11:23.332 --> 11:25.425
I mean, your speech
at the gala was on point.

11:25.501 --> 11:26.333
Oh, thank you.

11:26.502 --> 11:27.760
It's easy to
convince people to give

11:27.837 --> 11:28.928
when it's a good cause.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.314
Well, I hope so,
'cause, um...

11:32.250 --> 11:33.841
I need to borrow some money.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.694
Oh. How much you need?

11:35.770 --> 11:37.487
Um, $25,000?

11:38.423 --> 11:40.256
Okay, so it's not for rent?

11:40.275 --> 11:44.277
No, it's for my, um,
cousin Marvin in LA.

11:44.353 --> 11:47.205
He, um, is kind of in jail,

11:47.356 --> 11:49.040
and I'm just trying to help
with his bail money.

11:49.117 --> 11:51.376
-What'd he do?
-He borrowed a Ferrari.

11:51.527 --> 11:52.210
You mean stole?

11:52.454 --> 11:54.787
Well, he doesn't
keep them. Heh.

11:54.864 --> 11:56.697
"Them"? He's done it before?

11:56.775 --> 11:57.865
A few times.

11:58.276 --> 12:00.276
I mean, that's probably why
the bail is so high this time.

12:00.295 --> 12:01.886
It's usually not that much,

12:02.038 --> 12:03.796
and I just don't have it.

12:03.949 --> 12:06.132
Does he ask for money a lot?

12:06.284 --> 12:09.969
Mm, I've bailed him out,
like, two to five times.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.955
I mean, he's trying
to do better.

12:12.048 --> 12:14.457
(exhales)
Um...

12:14.459 --> 12:16.309
Mateo, did it ever
occur to you that the reason

12:16.461 --> 12:18.461
he's a repeat offender may be

12:18.463 --> 12:20.530
because he has someone else
to pay the bill?

12:21.408 --> 12:22.148
Um... (sighs)

12:22.300 --> 12:24.993
See, the thing is, Cap...

12:26.062 --> 12:27.912
I owe Marvin.

12:28.064 --> 12:29.414
I owe his whole family.

12:29.565 --> 12:32.158
I mean, they looked after me
when I came to this country.

12:32.310 --> 12:35.144
I lived with them
until I was about, like, 16.

12:35.163 --> 12:37.071
He's more like a brother
than a cousin.

12:37.148 --> 12:39.983
He always looked out for me
when we were kids.

12:39.985 --> 12:41.818
(exhales) Yeah,
I-I appreciate that.

12:41.820 --> 12:42.910
Um...

12:43.246 --> 12:45.004
But there's a difference
between looking out for someone

12:45.081 --> 12:47.340
and enabling bad behavior.

12:47.492 --> 12:49.601
Take it from me,
the father of an addict.

12:49.752 --> 12:51.436
Oh...

12:51.587 --> 12:54.981
(clicks tongue)
So, uh, I guess that's a no?

12:56.759 --> 12:59.277
I just don't think
I'd be doing you any favors.

13:00.171 --> 13:01.112
And I definitely don't think

13:01.189 --> 13:04.098
you'd be doing
your cousin any favors.

13:04.175 --> 13:06.559
He needs to learn
his lesson this time.

13:06.711 --> 13:07.577
Yeah.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.195
Well...

13:09.347 --> 13:10.663
Thanks anyways, Cap.

13:16.612 --> 13:18.546
(grunting)

13:21.635 --> 13:22.950
Whose face are you picturing?

13:22.969 --> 13:24.969
My own.

13:25.196 --> 13:26.620
Well, as
a medical professional,

13:26.698 --> 13:30.058
I insist that you
stop hitting yourself.

13:31.645 --> 13:32.685
(sniffs)

13:34.463 --> 13:36.205
Judd, you alright?

13:36.224 --> 13:37.565
Everything okay at home?

13:37.984 --> 13:39.800
Oh, man.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.361
It's been better, T.

13:42.564 --> 13:43.321
Well, listen to me.

13:43.506 --> 13:45.731
Having a toddler in the house

13:45.884 --> 13:47.733
is always stressful, okay?

13:47.886 --> 13:49.310
-Believe me.
-No.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.754
This ain't about Charlie.
This is...

13:51.756 --> 13:54.958
This is my 19-year-old
actin' like he's a toddler.

13:55.910 --> 13:57.418
-Wyatt?
-JUDD: Yeah.

13:58.154 --> 14:00.004
Is he, uh, I don't know,

14:00.156 --> 14:02.231
vandalizing freeway signs again?

14:02.250 --> 14:03.249
No.

14:03.401 --> 14:05.068
Uh, Wyatt decided to go ahead

14:05.161 --> 14:07.428
and just get his girlfriend
knocked up.

14:09.665 --> 14:10.640
Okay.

14:11.667 --> 14:13.167
Yeah.

14:13.186 --> 14:17.063
So now, he is hell-bent

14:18.099 --> 14:19.840
on ruining his entire life.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.267
He's quittin' school,

14:21.344 --> 14:22.509
and you're
never gonna guess what it is

14:22.604 --> 14:25.012
that he says he wants to do
when he grows up.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.364
He wants to be a firefighter.

14:27.258 --> 14:29.516
-Did you call Grace?
-No.

14:29.536 --> 14:32.662
No. I see the way
he idolizes you.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.023
It's not surprising, Judd.

14:36.101 --> 14:38.084
He's got a great role model.

14:39.862 --> 14:41.771
He's got...

14:41.773 --> 14:43.606
a big, blue-collar lunk

14:43.608 --> 14:47.110
who got another girl in trouble
for a role model.

14:47.128 --> 14:50.463
This kid, Tommy, this Wyatt,

14:50.539 --> 14:51.538
he's so intelligent.

14:51.799 --> 14:54.208
You know, he could
go out there into the world

14:54.285 --> 14:55.451
and really do something.

14:55.453 --> 14:57.094
He didn't wanna do that,
you know.

14:57.171 --> 14:59.213
He wants to throw it all away...

14:59.232 --> 15:01.274
be bum-ass Judd Junior.

15:03.311 --> 15:06.479
And I just don't want him to
make the same mistakes I made.

15:06.555 --> 15:08.389
That's not really up to you,
though, is it?

15:08.483 --> 15:10.466
Hey, you know what?
A piece of it is up to me

15:10.485 --> 15:12.577
because he wants me
to call the fire chief,

15:12.728 --> 15:13.594
just put in a good word for him

15:13.821 --> 15:16.581
and get him a spot
on the roster here.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.732
Hey.

15:18.752 --> 15:19.992
Tell me somethin'.

15:20.069 --> 15:22.587
If you could change any decision
that you've made

15:22.738 --> 15:25.757
since the day you met Grace...
would you?

15:30.171 --> 15:32.597
No. I don't reckon I would.

15:34.083 --> 15:35.558
Does that mean
call the fire chief?

15:36.603 --> 15:37.727
Did I say that?

15:38.605 --> 15:39.771
-No.
-So...

15:39.922 --> 15:41.088
TOMMY:
All I'm saying

15:41.107 --> 15:42.423
is that if your biggest problem

15:42.442 --> 15:45.259
is that Wyatt turn out
just like you,

15:45.278 --> 15:47.028
then you don't have a problem.

15:49.174 --> 15:51.098
He ain't like me, Tommy.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.766
(exhales) He ain't like me.

15:52.786 --> 15:53.993
(grunts)

16:00.518 --> 16:02.109
(Paul chuckling)

16:02.187 --> 16:04.036
Marwani, did you
reorganize these again?

16:04.113 --> 16:06.038
It was either
reorganize the kitchen

16:06.191 --> 16:07.781
or lose my mind on desk duty.

16:07.859 --> 16:08.816
Which would you prefer?

16:08.893 --> 16:10.359
What, is this alphabetical now?

16:10.378 --> 16:12.119
MARJAN:
It was that or color-coded.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.212
I can't even picture that.

16:13.364 --> 16:15.289
-Exactly.
-Hey, man, I like it.

16:15.366 --> 16:16.957
It's giving me
all kinds of ideas
for my cabinets at home.

16:16.977 --> 16:19.293
Hey, man,
you're the type of guy who
has a label maker at home.

16:19.370 --> 16:20.536
Well, her name is Bonnie,

16:20.555 --> 16:22.296
and we have
a very committed relationship.

16:22.373 --> 16:24.631
-Well.
-PAUL STRICKLAND: Mm-hmm.

16:24.709 --> 16:26.734
Oh, hey, man.
Looks like you got a visitor.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.406
Hey, Dad. Got a second?

16:34.977 --> 16:38.496
Yeah, yeah.
As long, as long as
these chimes don't go off.

16:38.573 --> 16:39.980
So you haven't been
responding to my texts.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.557
I just wanted
to reach out to see

16:41.559 --> 16:44.252
if you had any more thoughts
about what we talked about.

16:45.654 --> 16:48.731
You mean about putting in
a call to Chief Bowman?

16:48.750 --> 16:49.757
WYATT: Yeah.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.469
JUDD:
Yeah, Wyatt...

16:54.997 --> 16:56.222
I don't... (sighs)

16:57.742 --> 17:01.019
I won't be making that call.
I think that's a mistake.

17:01.929 --> 17:03.246
No, it's not a mistake.

17:03.248 --> 17:04.355
No, you gotta trust me
on this one, okay?

17:04.507 --> 17:06.249
It is. I've been
right where you are before.

17:06.267 --> 17:08.675
No, you haven't been
where I am.

17:08.695 --> 17:09.935
Dad, you weren't there at all.

17:10.104 --> 17:12.255
I'm gonna stick around
and I'm gonna raise my kid.

17:12.273 --> 17:14.014
And I know, I know that you
would have done the same

17:14.034 --> 17:16.108
if you had the chance,
but you didn't.

17:16.185 --> 17:17.518
Okay? I do.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.520
I'm not gonna make
the same mistakes
as you did, Dad.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.664
-Alright, alright, calm down.
-Uh, I'm-I'm gonna avoid them.

17:23.101 --> 17:25.117
I'm, I'm asking for your help.

17:25.270 --> 17:28.604
Man, I'm here
to help you, alright?

17:28.606 --> 17:30.882
And I do wanna make up for
all the time I wasn't there.

17:31.109 --> 17:32.291
So...

17:32.368 --> 17:34.385
Alright, then make the call.

17:35.963 --> 17:37.430
(exhales)

17:41.636 --> 17:42.968
I won't.

17:43.121 --> 17:45.379
(scoffs) Why not?

17:45.398 --> 17:47.214
Because I don't think
that you're up to it.

17:47.292 --> 17:48.691
I think that you're too soft.

17:51.071 --> 17:53.029
You think I'm too soft?

17:53.981 --> 17:55.364
For this job?

17:57.393 --> 17:59.077
Yeah, I do.

17:59.228 --> 18:01.304
Alright? 'Cause you take
no for an answer, Wyatt.

18:01.322 --> 18:02.580
And then you-- and you wilt

18:02.657 --> 18:03.973
anytime there's
a little pressure

18:03.991 --> 18:06.809
and you get this kinda
hangdog look on your face

18:06.828 --> 18:08.235
like you've got right now.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.420
-WYATT: No, I don't.
-Right-- Yes, you do.

18:09.497 --> 18:11.647
What about that time
at the job interview?

18:11.666 --> 18:12.514
Things got a little tough

18:12.667 --> 18:14.258
and you came
running outta there

18:14.410 --> 18:17.153
with your tail
tucked between your legs.

18:17.171 --> 18:18.988
Okay? This job ain't that.

18:18.990 --> 18:20.673
There ain't no do-overs here.

18:20.825 --> 18:22.350
So my answer's no.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.015
Well, what are you doin'?

18:30.092 --> 18:31.692
WYATT:
Taking no for an answer.

18:35.690 --> 18:38.357
MATEO:
No, we're talking
a mint-condition Squirtle here.

18:38.509 --> 18:40.526
I'm not taking a cent
under $1,200.

18:40.603 --> 18:43.937
No, you get a life,
you bridge troll!

18:43.957 --> 18:46.940
Oh, 900 bucks?

18:47.018 --> 18:49.293
Deal. Text me your deets.

18:51.022 --> 18:52.338
Hoo!

18:53.858 --> 18:55.024
What are you doing?

18:55.193 --> 18:58.285
Uh, I'm just selling
my PokÃ©mon card collection.

18:58.363 --> 18:59.211
What?

18:59.364 --> 19:01.881
Why would you do that?

19:01.957 --> 19:04.124
Um, I need to raise 25K.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.369
It's for my cousin Marvin in LA.

19:06.371 --> 19:08.146
He's locked up
and needs bail money.

19:08.297 --> 19:10.464
Your doppelganger
with the pink hair?

19:10.541 --> 19:11.816
Is that why
he called you earlier?

19:11.967 --> 19:14.226
Yeah. I mean,
Cap doesn't think
it's a good idea,

19:14.379 --> 19:15.319
and he's not wrong.

19:15.471 --> 19:18.138
I mean, he is a frequent flier.

19:18.216 --> 19:20.383
But, I mean, he's still...

19:20.401 --> 19:21.492
He's family.

19:21.644 --> 19:23.235
Yeah.

19:23.388 --> 19:24.904
Well, how much
more do you need?

19:24.980 --> 19:26.480
(clicks tongue)
Uh, well,

19:26.499 --> 19:29.225
I just made 900 bucks
off that Squirtle card,

19:29.227 --> 19:33.320
so that leaves me
with $24,100 to go.

19:33.339 --> 19:37.300
But some lady in Kyoto said
she'd give me $1,600 for...

19:37.919 --> 19:38.918
my Charizard card.

19:38.994 --> 19:40.903
Babe.

19:40.922 --> 19:42.604
Charizard is your favorite.

19:42.606 --> 19:43.681
I know.

19:43.832 --> 19:45.683
But I owe him, Nancy.

19:45.834 --> 19:47.560
Owe him for what exactly?

19:48.413 --> 19:50.021
It-it's complicated, okay?

19:50.097 --> 19:53.232
The point is,
I can't leave him hanging, okay?

19:54.101 --> 19:56.360
Even if he acts like an idiot.

19:57.513 --> 19:58.654
(cell phone chimes)

20:02.443 --> 20:06.019
Did you just
Venmo me $24,100?

20:06.097 --> 20:09.448
You tell that lady in Kyoto
to go to hell.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.768
Uh, what are you, like,
secretly rich or something?

20:12.787 --> 20:14.103
My dad used to say
that the only money

20:14.196 --> 20:16.288
that you can count on
is what's actually in the bank.

20:16.365 --> 20:19.533
I started saving when I was 13.

20:19.610 --> 20:20.593
(sighs)

20:22.797 --> 20:23.946
I mean, babe.

20:23.965 --> 20:25.038
This is too generous.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.633
Well, it's not a gift,
it's a loan.

20:27.785 --> 20:31.136
And I expect it to be paid back
every cent with interest

20:31.213 --> 20:33.122
once he shows up to court.

20:33.140 --> 20:35.382
For sure.
Look, you got it. Listen.

20:35.460 --> 20:39.052
You are such a good girlfriend,
you know that?

20:39.130 --> 20:41.297
-Try the best.
-Ever.

20:41.299 --> 20:42.055
Mm.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.699
BOTH: Mwah.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.620
-Charizard? Come on, man!
-I know.

20:48.806 --> 20:51.499
(screwdriver whirring)

20:57.665 --> 20:58.756
GRACE: Judd.

20:59.984 --> 21:01.259
Hey.

21:01.410 --> 21:03.168
Hope I didn't wake you up.

21:03.321 --> 21:06.171
You did, sweetheart.
What are you doing?

21:06.324 --> 21:09.008
Well, I had
a little leftover energy

21:09.084 --> 21:10.175
when I got off my shift,

21:10.328 --> 21:11.677
and so I thought I'd deal
with these hinges.

21:11.829 --> 21:14.179
And don't pretend like you
ain't been gettin' on me

21:14.256 --> 21:15.922
about these cabinets

21:16.000 --> 21:17.650
not opening and closing
the right way.

21:19.094 --> 21:21.654
Only for, like,
the past four years, yes.

21:22.690 --> 21:23.739
Ooh.

21:24.808 --> 21:26.284
That's like honey butter.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.703
Come here. Check it out.

21:36.445 --> 21:37.503
It is flush.

21:40.525 --> 21:43.301
So would you like to tell me
what this is actually about?

21:46.380 --> 21:49.289
Wyatt come by
the firehouse today.

21:49.367 --> 21:51.291
Hmm...

21:51.369 --> 21:55.521
He was on me about making
that call to the chief for him.

21:57.633 --> 22:00.526
Okay. So you told him no?

22:03.230 --> 22:05.698
It's worse
than that, Grace. I-I...

22:05.808 --> 22:11.329
I told him I wasn't gonna call
the chief because he's too soft.

22:12.332 --> 22:13.497
GRACE: Hmm.

22:14.058 --> 22:15.499
I see.

22:15.576 --> 22:18.377
You should have seen
that boy's face, Gracie.

22:21.156 --> 22:23.323
This might be a hard one
to get back.

22:23.401 --> 22:25.234
The only reason you would
take something back

22:25.252 --> 22:26.827
would be if you didn't mean it.

22:26.904 --> 22:28.737
So did you mean it?

22:28.739 --> 22:29.722
I did.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.165
Look, he's a wonderful kid.

22:32.185 --> 22:34.602
I think the world of him.
You know that.

22:35.746 --> 22:37.246
But ain't everybody
built for this.

22:37.264 --> 22:40.316
Well, I guess that's for him to
find out for himself, isn't it?

22:41.085 --> 22:42.084
I ain't stoppin' him.

22:42.086 --> 22:44.603
But you're not
helping him either.

22:44.755 --> 22:47.681
I'm-- I-I don't feel good
about calling the chief

22:47.700 --> 22:49.367
and telling him something
that I don't believe.

22:49.443 --> 22:51.685
Well, then you should
get yourself to the place

22:51.704 --> 22:53.112
to where you believe it.

22:53.264 --> 22:54.780
Because, sweetheart,
if you don't believe

22:54.907 --> 22:56.207
that your son is tough enough,

22:56.283 --> 22:58.450
then you should toughen him up.

22:58.603 --> 23:00.711
That's your job.
You're his father.

23:01.864 --> 23:03.339
(sighs)

23:04.199 --> 23:05.591
He's gonna hate me.

23:06.444 --> 23:07.242
Him and me both,

23:07.244 --> 23:08.611
if you keep me up any longer.

23:08.704 --> 23:11.204
Okay? Can we go to bed, please?

23:11.265 --> 23:13.099
Thank you for working on it.

23:16.804 --> 23:18.020
(sighs)

23:19.790 --> 23:21.290
What?

23:21.308 --> 23:24.460
I think you might be about
the wisest woman I ever met.

23:24.462 --> 23:25.477
(scoffs) Okay.

23:25.813 --> 23:28.322
I'll try not to be
offended by that.
Thank you.

23:28.891 --> 23:31.224
I also think...

23:31.244 --> 23:34.745
you gonna be the finest grandma
in these parts.

23:34.822 --> 23:36.472
-Excuse me?
-JUDD: Hmm. Hmm.

23:36.490 --> 23:38.916
You didn't just call me
a grandma, I know you didn't.

23:38.993 --> 23:40.492
Oh, you want Granny
or Me-Maw or...

23:40.645 --> 23:41.919
Oh, okay.

23:42.146 --> 23:44.463
Keep on, Grandpa,
and you gonna be
sleeping on that couch.

23:53.991 --> 23:56.082
I hope you all
enjoyed your trip back

23:56.084 --> 23:57.843
because I want dinner
hitting the table

23:57.845 --> 24:00.604
at 1800 hours, okay?

24:00.940 --> 24:02.347
Mateo, you're on protein detail.

24:02.500 --> 24:04.257
Paul, you are choppin' veggies.

24:04.335 --> 24:05.943
Judd, you are peeling.

24:06.094 --> 24:08.187
Everybody else,
the SCBAs need a top-up

24:08.339 --> 24:10.781
and we gotta reload
the four-inch hose, okay?

24:10.933 --> 24:12.283
Man, that woman is relentless.

24:12.434 --> 24:14.267
We have to get her back
into the field.

24:14.287 --> 24:15.694
-Yeah, like I been sayin'.
-(cell phone ringing)

24:15.846 --> 24:17.012
MATEO:
Oh. (laughs)

24:17.014 --> 24:18.122
Hey, what's up, cuz?

24:18.199 --> 24:20.683
How's that free air taste?

24:20.685 --> 24:23.335
Oh, hey, what's up, Daniela?
Where's Marvin?

24:25.022 --> 24:27.298
(tense music playing)

24:29.860 --> 24:30.968
How?

24:35.123 --> 24:37.716
(dramatic sting)

24:37.793 --> 24:42.204
I hope whoever owned
that Porsche had it insured.

24:42.223 --> 24:44.523
My cousin Daniela said
there wasn't much left.

24:45.485 --> 24:47.133
Mateo, I'm so sorry.

24:48.488 --> 24:51.530
You know, he'd only
been out two hours
since he did it again.

24:53.809 --> 24:55.400
He's dead because of me.

24:55.477 --> 24:56.577
That's not true.

24:58.222 --> 25:00.164
Except that it is.

25:00.315 --> 25:03.408
I mean, if I had just listened
to you, Cap, and said no,

25:03.485 --> 25:07.004
he'd be sitting in jail,
pissed, but alive.

25:07.155 --> 25:08.839
I put him behind that wheel.

25:08.991 --> 25:10.633
He put himself
behind the wheel.

25:11.827 --> 25:13.402
Made a bad choice.

25:13.420 --> 25:15.346
You know, he's not the only one.

25:17.091 --> 25:20.000
I guess now you can say
I told you so.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.076
You know me better than that.

25:21.095 --> 25:23.020
Yeah, you have every right to.

25:24.690 --> 25:25.981
(sighs)

25:27.418 --> 25:29.251
Your shift's over.
Go home.

25:29.270 --> 25:31.487
I can send somebody with you
if you want.

25:33.015 --> 25:34.365
I'm good.

25:34.942 --> 25:36.425
(sniffles)

25:36.427 --> 25:37.535
(Mateo sighs)

25:39.613 --> 25:41.354
Oh. Um...

25:41.432 --> 25:43.207
Cap, uh...

25:43.284 --> 25:44.708
I may need
to still borrow some cash.

25:44.860 --> 25:48.028
I don't know if I could afford
that trip to LA for his funeral

25:48.105 --> 25:50.464
and I'm all tapped out
from his bail.

25:51.458 --> 25:52.675
Whatever you need.

25:53.553 --> 25:54.793
Yeah.

25:54.945 --> 25:56.612
That was easy.

25:56.630 --> 25:57.871
(sniffles)

25:57.948 --> 25:59.431
Thanks, Cap.

26:02.469 --> 26:04.228
Well, listen, Nance,
it may be a while

26:04.455 --> 26:05.729
before I get, uh,
get you that bail money back.

26:05.956 --> 26:07.139
Um, because I'm not sure
how it works

26:07.341 --> 26:10.383
when someone's out on bail
and they die committing a crime.

26:10.461 --> 26:12.311
Don't worry
about that right now.

26:12.463 --> 26:13.629
No, but I'm gonna
get you your money back.

26:13.647 --> 26:16.615
I mean, with interest,
just like you said.

26:18.469 --> 26:20.619
I just really wish you
hadn't given me the money.

26:23.307 --> 26:25.157
Are you mad that I did?

26:25.233 --> 26:26.917
No, of course not.

26:27.069 --> 26:29.161
I'm mad that I took it.

26:29.237 --> 26:30.588
I just don't know
what my aunt and uncle
are gonna say

26:30.739 --> 26:33.073
when they find out
I'm the one
that posted the bond.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.240
I'm sure that they'll think

26:34.318 --> 26:35.500
that you were
just trying to help.

26:35.653 --> 26:37.911
Yeah, but there's a reason
why he didn't call them.

26:37.988 --> 26:40.097
Or if he did,
they told him no.

26:40.324 --> 26:42.341
And now I gotta call them.
I don't know...

26:42.417 --> 26:44.084
I'll probably just call them
when I get home.

26:44.211 --> 26:46.495
Well, you know,
I can go with you.

26:46.513 --> 26:48.513
Um, just let me
talk to Captain Vega,

26:48.590 --> 26:50.090
because I'm sure
that she'll let me have...

26:50.167 --> 26:51.667
-No.
-...the rest of the shift off.

26:51.669 --> 26:52.985
No. Uh...

26:53.946 --> 26:55.187
Don't do that.

26:55.263 --> 26:57.263
But you shouldn't be alone
right now, Mateo.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.074
Yeah, well,
that's what I want.

27:00.494 --> 27:01.493
Okay.

27:03.456 --> 27:04.622
I'll call you later.

27:05.866 --> 27:08.042
â™ªâ™ª

27:11.631 --> 27:14.715
MATEO:
<i> He'd only been out two hours</i>
<i> since he did it again.</i>

27:15.968 --> 27:18.451
<i> He's dead because of me.</i>

27:18.529 --> 27:21.472
<i> I mean, if I had just listened</i>

27:21.623 --> 27:24.475

27:24.626 --> 27:26.727
<i> And I put him</i>

27:28.130 --> 27:31.398
(tense music playing)

27:40.718 --> 27:42.326
(heavy breathing)

27:44.889 --> 27:46.330
(screams)

27:49.393 --> 27:51.001
(exhales)

27:51.837 --> 27:53.379
I have to do this.

27:55.675 --> 27:57.007
(thuds)

27:57.159 --> 28:00.678
(alarm ringing)

28:01.847 --> 28:03.830
(sighs, inhales)

28:03.849 --> 28:05.073
You smell that, Matty?

28:05.167 --> 28:06.600
Mom made French toast.

28:09.246 --> 28:11.171
Hey, cuz, rise and shine.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.338
(sitcom audience laughing)

28:12.416 --> 28:13.916
(cheerful sitcom music playing)

28:13.934 --> 28:16.360
(audience gasping,
laughing)

28:19.940 --> 28:21.281
(grunts)

28:22.109 --> 28:23.033
(objects clatter)

28:23.110 --> 28:25.035
(audience laughing)

28:26.931 --> 28:29.039
(panting)

28:29.191 --> 28:31.542
(laughter continues)

28:32.044 --> 28:33.452
Oh, hey, Marvin.

28:33.604 --> 28:36.788
Matty, you know you're not
supposed to be sneaking out.

28:36.865 --> 28:38.048
I'm not sneaking out.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.634
I'm sneaking back in.
Give me a hand.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.779
(audience laughing)

28:43.781 --> 28:45.705
(panting)

28:45.783 --> 28:46.782
(grunts)

28:46.800 --> 28:48.450
Look at this mess.

28:48.452 --> 28:51.470
You know, my mom said
if she caught you sneaking out

28:51.546 --> 28:53.379
that she was gonna
nail that window shut.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.232
-That'd be a fire hazard.
-(audience laughing)

28:55.309 --> 28:57.626
And anyway,
you're not gonna
tell on me, are you?

28:57.628 --> 29:00.312
I don't have to,
because you're gonna
get caught red-handed.

29:00.464 --> 29:02.130
And what makes you say that?

29:02.132 --> 29:03.407
'Cause your hands are red.

29:03.558 --> 29:04.983
(audience laughing)

29:05.135 --> 29:06.910
They're not red.
It's alarming pink.

29:06.912 --> 29:08.078
(audience laughing)

29:08.305 --> 29:10.138
Darn. It must have leaked
from the spray cans.

29:10.157 --> 29:11.473
Wait. What spray cans?

29:11.492 --> 29:14.142
-Those spray cans.
-(audience laughs)

29:14.161 --> 29:16.903
That's funny.
There was two of those.

29:16.981 --> 29:19.757
You weren't out tagging with
your friends again, were you?

29:19.833 --> 29:21.074
(audience laughing)

29:21.093 --> 29:23.076
Do you wanna get
deported back to Mexico?

29:23.153 --> 29:24.577
I don't know.

29:24.655 --> 29:26.079
I was only six
when I moved in with you

29:26.098 --> 29:27.431
and Aunt Marisol and Uncle O.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.916
I mean,
I don't remember Mexico.

29:30.010 --> 29:30.993
-Is it nice?
-(audience laughs)

29:31.086 --> 29:32.936
You're gonna find out.

29:33.088 --> 29:34.563
Now what did you
deface this time?

29:35.349 --> 29:36.164
The school.

29:36.183 --> 29:37.107
-AUDIENCE: Ooh!
-Matty.

29:37.184 --> 29:38.424
(Matty grunts)

29:38.593 --> 29:40.502
Well, I mean, you're the one
that's always telling me

29:40.504 --> 29:41.445
to take an interest
in school.

29:41.522 --> 29:42.762
And, well,

29:42.931 --> 29:44.506
-that was pretty interesting.
-(audience laughing)

29:44.599 --> 29:48.010
Well, I mean,
speaking of school,
you better get cleaned up

29:48.012 --> 29:50.012
or else we're gonna be late.

29:50.030 --> 29:51.437
I don't think
we're gonna be late.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.348
I don't even think
that's possible.

29:53.367 --> 29:56.018
Huh. And why do you say that?

29:56.036 --> 29:57.944
Because it's not there anymore.

29:58.022 --> 29:59.546
What's not there anymore?

30:00.541 --> 30:02.633
-The school.
-(audience laughing)

30:02.784 --> 30:03.759
It kinda...

30:04.711 --> 30:05.527
burned down.

30:05.546 --> 30:06.452
(audience gasps)

30:06.547 --> 30:09.473
<i>â™ª Marvin loves a classic book â™ª</i>

30:09.550 --> 30:12.367
<i> â™ª He likes to rest</i>

30:12.369 --> 30:16.129
<i> â™ª Then Matty moved in</i>

30:16.148 --> 30:19.299

30:36.818 --> 30:38.335
You burned down the school?

30:38.562 --> 30:40.912
I didn't say I burned it down.
I said it burned down.

30:41.006 --> 30:43.006
Well, schools just
don't burn down.

30:43.083 --> 30:44.157
They do.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.250
Especially when janitors

30:45.402 --> 30:46.751
carelessly leave
the door unlocked

30:46.904 --> 30:48.328
for innocent children

30:48.347 --> 30:49.738
to break in and play
in the science lab

30:49.740 --> 30:51.181
-with the bursting burners.
-(audience laughing)

30:51.333 --> 30:53.333
-Bunsen.
<i> -Gesundheit.</i>

UNCLE O:
Oh, boys, you up yet?

30:55.337 --> 30:56.745
-Oh no!
-It's Dad.

30:56.763 --> 30:58.021
Come on!

30:58.098 --> 31:00.082
(whispering)
What do I do, what do I do?

31:00.100 --> 31:02.359
(audience chuckling)

31:03.103 --> 31:04.344
Hey, Uncle O.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.755
UNCLE O:
You're not still in bed,
are you?

31:06.757 --> 31:08.256
No, we're up, sir.

31:08.258 --> 31:10.092
(chuckles)
Hey, Dad.

31:10.094 --> 31:12.094
Oh, Mateo,
you're already dressed.

31:12.096 --> 31:13.186
Yes, sir.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.097
And your bed is made.

31:15.115 --> 31:17.099
A little lumpy bumpy,
but, uh, an A for effort.

31:17.101 --> 31:18.858
-(audience laughing)
-Thanks, Uncle O.

31:18.878 --> 31:22.104
Though the rest
of your side of the room
could use a little attention

31:22.106 --> 31:24.030
from the Army Corps
of Engineers.

31:24.124 --> 31:25.883
-(both chuckle)
-(audience laughing)

31:26.034 --> 31:27.867
What does your Aunt Marisol
always say?

31:27.887 --> 31:30.445
Um, a tidy room for a tidy mind.

31:30.464 --> 31:32.389
How many times
do I have to tell you?

31:32.499 --> 31:33.891
-Listen to the...
-BOTH: To the boss.

31:34.042 --> 31:35.559
-(both chuckle)
-(audience laughing)

31:35.786 --> 31:38.378
Marvin, you're still
standing there in your PJs.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.473
Come on.
Why don't you follow
your cousin's fine example

31:41.625 --> 31:43.308
and get dressed and get
downstairs for breakfast?

31:43.460 --> 31:46.361
It's gonna be on the table
in two minutes.

31:48.132 --> 31:49.481
(sighs deeply)

31:49.633 --> 31:51.149
Two minutes?

31:51.301 --> 31:53.243
What am I gonna do
about these?

31:53.320 --> 31:55.637
Relax. I've got your back.

31:55.656 --> 31:57.456
We'll figure something out.

31:58.900 --> 32:00.083
Turpentine.

32:00.235 --> 32:02.235
Mom keeps turpentine
under the kitchen sink.

32:02.312 --> 32:04.312
That should take
the paint off lickety-split.

32:04.331 --> 32:06.406
-You sure?
-Oh, yeah.

32:06.425 --> 32:08.483
'Cause it'll probably
take your skin off with it.

32:08.485 --> 32:11.762
-(audience laughing)
-(jaunty transition music)

32:11.913 --> 32:14.097
<i> Buenos dÃ­as, chicos.</i>

32:14.174 --> 32:16.007
-Who wants French toast?
-Ooh!

32:16.084 --> 32:17.175
I do.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.995
Mateo, don't you wanna
wash your hands first?

32:20.013 --> 32:22.439
Oh, yeah. Good call.

32:22.516 --> 32:24.608
Since when do you
two knuckleheads
wash your hands

32:24.835 --> 32:26.017
before breakfast?

32:26.094 --> 32:28.003
Uh, since I read an article

32:28.021 --> 32:30.505
on the bacteria
expression vectors.

32:30.507 --> 32:32.616
Marvin, how many times
have I told you

32:32.767 --> 32:36.495
we do not discuss
pathogenic bacterium
at the table?

32:37.030 --> 32:38.121
I'm sorry, Mom.

32:38.273 --> 32:39.605
I always try to tell you, boys.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.199
UNCLE O/MARVIN/MATTY:
Listen to the boss.

32:41.276 --> 32:42.275
-(Matty/Marvin laugh)
-(audience laughing)

32:42.294 --> 32:43.518
MATTY:
It kinda burns.

32:43.520 --> 32:44.628
That's your fault, stupid.

32:44.871 --> 32:47.130
MILKMAN JUDD:
Milk delivery!
Get it while it's cold.

32:47.207 --> 32:49.299
How does he always
manage to show up

32:49.376 --> 32:50.950
just as the food
is being served?

32:51.028 --> 32:52.194
It's called timing, dear.

32:52.212 --> 32:53.971
Come in, Milkman Judd.

32:54.122 --> 32:55.788
-Aah!
-(audience cheers)

32:55.866 --> 32:57.866
(sniffs) Ooh.

32:57.959 --> 32:59.142
It must be Tuesday

32:59.219 --> 33:00.644
because that's
the unmistakable aroma

33:00.795 --> 33:04.648
of Marisol's famous
French toast and turpentine.

33:04.799 --> 33:07.242
-(audience chuckles)
-Wait a minute. Turpentine?

33:07.244 --> 33:08.376
That can't be right.

33:08.395 --> 33:11.062
Uh, it must be Matteo's cologne.

33:11.215 --> 33:13.973
-(chuckles nervously)
-It's... unique.

33:13.993 --> 33:15.550
Milkman Judd,

33:15.569 --> 33:18.811
can we interest you
in some French toast?

33:18.889 --> 33:20.388
Well, I don't know.

33:20.390 --> 33:22.165
I've got a lot of other
deliveries to make,

33:22.242 --> 33:25.227
but what the heck,
it's only milk, it'll keep.

33:25.229 --> 33:26.628
-(Uncle O chuckles)
-(audience laughs)

33:28.990 --> 33:30.732
So... Oh.

33:30.734 --> 33:33.918
Did you all hear about
the fiasco at the middle school?

33:34.071 --> 33:35.178
(audience gasps)

33:35.297 --> 33:37.422
No!
What happened?

33:37.499 --> 33:40.183
Someone done gone
and burned it to the ground.

33:40.335 --> 33:42.019
(gasps) You're kidding.

33:42.170 --> 33:43.912
That's terrible.

33:43.914 --> 33:44.688
Who would do such a thing?

33:45.024 --> 33:47.340
-My hands are clean.
-(audience laughing)

33:47.359 --> 33:51.086
Is it me or are they acting
peculiar today?

33:51.088 --> 33:52.921
It's just you, Daniela.

33:52.939 --> 33:53.938
(knock on door)

33:54.091 --> 33:56.182
Now who could that be?

33:56.201 --> 33:57.683
Milkman Judd,
do you really think

33:57.761 --> 34:00.278
someone would intentionally
burn down the school?

34:00.355 --> 34:02.355
Could it just be faulty wiring?

34:02.374 --> 34:07.044
Yeah, exactly. Faulty wiring.
Let's go with that.

34:07.120 --> 34:09.104
-Ow!
-The scuttlebutt is, uh,

34:09.106 --> 34:10.530
it was some delinquents,

34:10.549 --> 34:11.697
and they found some evidence.

34:12.033 --> 34:14.718
These officers say that
they'd like to speak to us.

34:14.869 --> 34:16.219
-AUDIENCE: Ooh.
-(Daniela gasps)

34:16.254 --> 34:17.779
It's that dreamy officer Reyes

34:17.798 --> 34:19.038
-and his nincompoop sidekick.
-(audience whistling)

34:19.058 --> 34:20.115
You think if I confess,

34:20.133 --> 34:21.374
they'll take me away
in handcuffs?

34:21.393 --> 34:22.559
-Daniela.
-(audience laughing)

34:22.710 --> 34:25.378
We apologize
for disturbing your breakfast.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.472
-It smells delicious.
-Except for the turpentine.

34:27.549 --> 34:29.140
-(audience laughing)
-UNCLE O: Where are my manners?

34:29.293 --> 34:30.642
Would you like
some French toast?

34:30.794 --> 34:31.810
Why, yes, we would.

34:31.886 --> 34:33.052
No, we wouldn't.

34:33.054 --> 34:34.296
-No, we wouldn't.
-(audience laughs)

34:34.314 --> 34:36.073
I don't know if you've heard,
but some vandals

34:36.224 --> 34:37.557
burned down
the middle school last night.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.484
Yes. We were just
getting the skinny

34:39.636 --> 34:40.318
from our town crier.

34:40.470 --> 34:42.061
-Huh!
-(audience laughs)

34:42.081 --> 34:44.748
-We found this at the scene.
-(Matty/Marvin gasp)

34:44.825 --> 34:46.825
(quietly) I'm so dead.

34:46.977 --> 34:48.543
And so deported.

34:50.238 --> 34:52.163
So much for having my back.

34:52.240 --> 34:53.815
Well, that can't be
from anyone in this house,

34:53.834 --> 34:56.318
because around here,
we use only oil-based paint.

34:56.320 --> 34:58.261
Mr. Zapruder
down at the hardware store

34:58.413 --> 35:01.522
has surveillance film
that proves otherwise.

35:01.524 --> 35:03.341
They've got your nephew
young Mateo

35:03.493 --> 35:05.084
on film buying two cans, sir.

35:05.162 --> 35:07.086
-(audience gasps)
-Oh!

35:07.088 --> 35:08.163
Mateo, is that true?

35:08.181 --> 35:09.831
(breathes shakily)

35:09.833 --> 35:10.999
Mateo?

35:11.017 --> 35:11.942
We took you into this house

35:12.093 --> 35:13.668
and treated you
like our own son.

35:13.687 --> 35:16.095
Partially because half the time
we couldn't tell the difference,

35:16.115 --> 35:17.339
-but also...
-(audience laughing)

35:17.357 --> 35:19.341
...because we love you
like a son.

35:19.359 --> 35:22.452
Now, I'm sorry, but I'm going
to need to know the truth.

35:22.529 --> 35:25.697
What will we see
on the Zapruder film?

35:25.849 --> 35:28.016
Uh, um... Uh...

35:28.034 --> 35:30.143
-Me.
-(audience gasps)

35:30.220 --> 35:32.629
You're going to see me
on that film.

35:32.780 --> 35:33.855
Not my identical cousin.

35:33.874 --> 35:35.948
(all gasp)

35:35.968 --> 35:38.301
You have paint in your hair.

35:38.453 --> 35:40.953
-Alarming pink.
-(audience laughing)

35:41.031 --> 35:42.197
Mateo didn't
burn down the school.

35:42.199 --> 35:43.557
(wink chimes)

35:44.551 --> 35:45.475
I did.

35:45.627 --> 35:47.352
-No!
-Marvin?

35:48.054 --> 35:49.813
But that's not true.

35:49.964 --> 35:51.389
It is true.

35:51.541 --> 35:53.057
You see, I, um,
snuck out last night

35:53.134 --> 35:54.651
and met up
with some of the guys.

35:54.878 --> 35:57.879
-I mean, we didn't mean
to burn down the school.
-(audience gasping)

35:57.881 --> 35:59.305
It was an accident,

35:59.383 --> 36:01.658
if that makes any difference.

36:02.719 --> 36:04.219
No, it does not.

36:04.221 --> 36:05.996
Sneaking out is no accident

36:06.147 --> 36:08.390
and hanging out
with those hoodlums...

36:08.408 --> 36:10.575
I'm gonna wanna know
who those boys are.

36:10.727 --> 36:11.559
I want names.

36:11.578 --> 36:13.319
MARVIN:
Well, Dad,

36:13.397 --> 36:15.112
you can't send me
to juvenile jail

36:15.190 --> 36:17.248
with a reputation as a fink.

36:17.401 --> 36:19.843
He's right. He might get
shanked with a toothbrush.

36:19.994 --> 36:21.344
-Uh-huh.
-(audience laughing)

36:21.496 --> 36:24.072
Um, I take full responsibility.

36:24.090 --> 36:25.831
AUDIENCE: Aw!

36:25.851 --> 36:28.059
(poignant music playing)

36:33.417 --> 36:35.192
Turn around.
Hands behind your back.

36:35.343 --> 36:36.610
â™ªâ™ª

36:38.422 --> 36:40.438
-No.
-(Marisol crying)

36:40.590 --> 36:41.756
Marvin, don't do this.

36:42.034 --> 36:44.534
If you get into the system,
you'll end up down a bad road.

36:44.686 --> 36:47.078
See, I don't
want you on that road.

36:48.114 --> 36:50.624
You will die on that road.

36:51.192 --> 36:52.500
It's okay, cuz.

36:53.103 --> 36:54.461
I got your back.

36:55.029 --> 36:56.621
Let's go.

36:56.698 --> 36:57.631
No. Marvin!

36:58.550 --> 36:59.274
Marvin!

36:59.276 --> 37:01.626
(dramatic crescendo)

37:01.778 --> 37:02.761
(yells) Marvin!

37:03.947 --> 37:05.263
(muttering)

37:06.058 --> 37:07.390
(weakly) Marvin.

37:11.955 --> 37:13.063
(winces)

37:13.715 --> 37:14.689
(exhales)

37:15.792 --> 37:16.691
(sighs)

37:25.059 --> 37:27.302
Next time, call somebody.

37:27.320 --> 37:29.320
Yeah, I will,
if I don't pass out.

37:29.473 --> 37:31.498
How about if
there isn't a next time?

37:33.401 --> 37:35.085
Yeah, I'm sorry
about the rug, Cap.

37:35.236 --> 37:37.312
It's okay. I've been wanting
to get a new one anyway.

37:37.330 --> 37:39.497
Are you sure he doesn't need
to go to the hospital?

37:39.591 --> 37:41.758
No, I need to go
to the police station.

37:41.909 --> 37:44.094
The police station?
Why?

37:44.170 --> 37:45.745
To report a crime.

37:45.764 --> 37:48.006
W-- What crime?

37:48.082 --> 37:50.892
Vandalism, arson, I guess.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.687
That's what they
arrested him for but...

37:54.681 --> 37:55.689
it was me.

37:58.518 --> 38:03.280
W-- Mateo, are you delirious
or are you just still drunk?

38:03.431 --> 38:05.840
Well, I'm not<i> not </i> drunk.

38:05.842 --> 38:07.575
But it's true.

38:09.513 --> 38:12.664
I burned down my school.
It was me and these guys.

38:13.850 --> 38:15.199
I was 13.

38:15.276 --> 38:17.627
It's when I was staying
with my cousin and his family.

38:18.855 --> 38:20.422
They treated me so good...

38:21.133 --> 38:22.281
and I ruined their lives.

38:22.301 --> 38:23.967
I mean,
they don't know it, but...

38:24.636 --> 38:25.677
they need to know.

38:27.030 --> 38:28.046
Mateo.

38:28.198 --> 38:30.390
No, he didn't want
me to get deported.

38:31.201 --> 38:33.551
So he said it was him.

38:33.703 --> 38:36.054
He went to juvie for me,
and it changed him.

38:36.130 --> 38:37.705
And if-if he didn't
do it that way,

38:37.724 --> 38:38.982
things would have been
totally different.

38:39.133 --> 38:40.875
-You don't know that.
-No, I-I do.

38:40.935 --> 38:41.893
See, there was two Marvins.

38:41.969 --> 38:42.986
There was the one before juvie,

38:43.063 --> 38:44.303
and then there was
the one after.

38:44.323 --> 38:46.972
And, uh...
I need to clear his name.

38:46.992 --> 38:49.400
I mean, this is something
that I should have done
a long time ago.

38:49.477 --> 38:51.811
Cap, will you drive me
to the station?

38:51.830 --> 38:53.479
Mateo, I don't know

38:53.557 --> 38:56.315
the statute of limitations
on juvenile crimes,

38:56.393 --> 38:58.893
but if you turn yourself in now,

38:58.912 --> 39:00.670
you could lose everything.

39:01.673 --> 39:02.988
Yeah.

39:03.066 --> 39:04.990
And I deserve to.

39:05.010 --> 39:07.260
You've been
holding this in a long time.

39:09.906 --> 39:10.830
(sniffles)

39:10.849 --> 39:12.640
Feels like my whole life, Cap.

39:16.021 --> 39:18.170
I need to make this right.

39:18.190 --> 39:20.098
-OWEN: Okay.
-(Mateo sighs)

39:20.192 --> 39:21.691
I'll drive you to the station.

39:26.031 --> 39:27.447
(knock on door)

39:29.259 --> 39:30.617
-Hey.
-Hey.

39:31.428 --> 39:32.452
Come on in.

39:33.205 --> 39:34.278
Thanks for coming through.

39:34.355 --> 39:36.122
-Yeah, no worries.
-Yeah.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.293
So... what's up?

39:41.788 --> 39:43.380
Well, uh...

39:43.607 --> 39:45.364
I've just been thinking
a lot about the way

39:45.384 --> 39:47.775
things ended
between me and you.
It didn't...

39:47.794 --> 39:49.201
it didn't sit right.

39:49.279 --> 39:51.054
-Really?
-JUDD: Yeah.

39:51.131 --> 39:52.389
I forgot all about it.

39:52.540 --> 39:53.681
Yeah.

39:54.451 --> 39:55.975
Anyway, uh...

39:57.044 --> 39:58.395
so Gracie and I talked,

39:58.471 --> 40:02.306
and, uh, we're willing to
help out you and Leigh Ann.

40:02.383 --> 40:05.217
And, uh, you know,
well, for a while at least

40:05.295 --> 40:06.611
until you graduate...

40:08.798 --> 40:10.323
from the Fire Academy.

40:11.635 --> 40:12.892
What?

40:12.969 --> 40:14.911
I thought you said
I was too soft.

40:15.062 --> 40:16.061
So you are.

40:16.081 --> 40:18.806
But if we set aside
some real time,

40:18.808 --> 40:21.584
I'll train you myself,
and we could toughen you up

40:21.736 --> 40:24.587
and you can go in there
and you can earn your seat
at the Academy.

40:24.664 --> 40:27.815
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna work for me.

40:27.834 --> 40:29.074
JUDD: Hmm.

40:29.094 --> 40:31.076
Why is that?

40:31.096 --> 40:33.263
'Cause I'm starting
at the Academy next week.

40:33.990 --> 40:35.265
Next week?

40:36.993 --> 40:38.918
So how'd you swing that?

40:38.995 --> 40:40.937
I didn't take
no for an answer.

40:41.088 --> 40:43.181
You shot me down,
I went and talked
to the chief myself.

40:43.257 --> 40:45.833
So what, you-you just
went down to Bowman's office

40:45.835 --> 40:46.851
and, what, just barged in?

40:46.928 --> 40:48.236
Pretty much.

40:49.689 --> 40:52.840
Don't worry. I didn't, like,
use your name or anything.

40:52.859 --> 40:53.783
What, are you pissed?

40:53.893 --> 40:56.494
I...
No, I'm surprised.

40:57.697 --> 40:59.104
And I'm proud.

40:59.182 --> 41:00.790
I'm really proud of you.

41:00.867 --> 41:01.975
Still think I'm soft?

41:01.977 --> 41:05.128
Yeah. You-you soft
as a baby's belly.

41:05.205 --> 41:07.297
Alright, we got work to do.

41:07.448 --> 41:09.424
So I got you
some of this stuff here.

41:10.210 --> 41:12.043
Should be your size, but.

41:12.195 --> 41:15.138
God, Dad, you did not
have to do that.

41:15.289 --> 41:18.382
Wyatt, I did have to do that.
I'm your dad. That's my job.

41:18.535 --> 41:20.643
So let's get changed.
Let's go.

41:21.705 --> 41:23.128
You mean, like,
right this second?

41:23.206 --> 41:24.630
You just told me
you start next week.

41:24.649 --> 41:27.800
So, yeah, we don't really have
a lot of time to kill here.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.027
Let's go.

41:31.639 --> 41:32.714
Um...

41:32.732 --> 41:35.074
(upbeat music playing)

41:35.568 --> 41:36.384
(sniffles)

41:36.644 --> 41:38.219
JUDD:
Alright. Let's go. Let's go.

41:38.221 --> 41:39.311
Come on, man.

41:39.405 --> 41:42.073
We don't got a lot
of time to waste here, so.

41:42.225 --> 41:44.408
Yeah, get that--
oh, and then, uh...

41:44.503 --> 41:47.820
yeah, put that on--
on top of that.

41:47.897 --> 41:50.173
-Is that a garbage bag?
-Yeah.

41:50.324 --> 41:52.008
-What is that for?
-(Judd clears throat)

41:52.827 --> 41:54.260
That's to help you suffer.

41:56.998 --> 41:57.922
(Wyatt scoffs)

41:58.074 --> 41:59.349
JUDD: Hmm?

42:11.178 --> 42:12.344
MATEO:
What are we doing here?

42:12.364 --> 42:15.256
I told ya,
I'd take you to the station.

42:15.258 --> 42:17.275
The police station, Cap.

42:17.351 --> 42:18.943
You say you wanna
make things right,

42:19.020 --> 42:21.186
this is how
you make things right.

42:21.264 --> 42:22.705
The way you've been doing it.

42:22.857 --> 42:25.266
You come here every day
and you try to save someone

42:25.285 --> 42:27.377
and you do it because
you couldn't save Marvin.

42:27.528 --> 42:28.603
It's not the same.

42:28.772 --> 42:31.196
Confessing to a crime
that's 10 years old

42:31.274 --> 42:32.774
and already been paid for,

42:32.792 --> 42:34.384
Marvin did that for you.

42:35.387 --> 42:37.202
Don't throw away his sacrifice.

42:37.280 --> 42:39.538
Your work here is too important.

42:39.616 --> 42:41.724
It's too important to me.
It's too important to everybody.

42:43.210 --> 42:44.978
I'm sorry you lost your cousin.

42:46.306 --> 42:47.981
But I don't wanna lose you.

42:50.885 --> 42:52.360
Thanks, Cap.

42:53.054 --> 42:54.487
You bet, son.

42:59.027 --> 43:01.327
â™ªâ™ª

43:05.399 --> 43:06.916
JUDD:
Alright, tenderfoot.

43:06.993 --> 43:08.293
How you feel?

43:09.495 --> 43:11.629
Let's push it a little bit.
Let's go!

43:12.832 --> 43:14.424
There you go, boy.
Come on!
