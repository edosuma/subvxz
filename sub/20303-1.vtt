WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.545
NARRATOR:<i> Coming in tonight</i>
<i>on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.628 --> 00:05.880
-Forget the monkey. I'll get him!
-(gibberish)

00:05.964 --> 00:07.590
Do you remember when we were first married

00:07.674 --> 00:11.678
that little something extra I used
to give you for your birthday?

00:11.761 --> 00:14.097
I want your body...

00:14.597 --> 00:16.099
pressing against mine.

00:16.182 --> 00:18.643
Word has it, you might want to pick up
where you left off.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.103
I'm not your enemy.

00:20.186 --> 00:21.938
Hudson's taking over the Arrow again.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.357
Anyone that stands in his way
is a dead man.

00:24.441 --> 00:27.110
I just get bits and pieces of the people
I love the most.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.611
I can't give more yet.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.947
Well, one way or another,
I think you ought to decide.

00:33.450 --> 00:39.247
Item 14 concerns the unauthorized use
of precinct phones for personal business.

00:39.330 --> 00:43.043
Guys, we all live in an age
of, uh, message units

00:43.126 --> 00:45.462
and diminished precinct budgets, so, uh,

00:46.087 --> 00:49.257
let's employ a little heart
and at least a little good taste.

00:49.340 --> 00:50.175
That's why...

00:50.258 --> 00:52.135
By that, I refer to certain
particular phone numbers

00:52.218 --> 00:54.304
which appear frequently
on the computer printout,

00:54.387 --> 00:59.976
phone numbers well known
as those of Chu-Chu's Snug Boutique.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.186
(clamoring)

01:01.269 --> 01:05.106
PHIL: And a certain bookmaker
simply known as Stu.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.193
Now if you feel you must misdemeanor,

01:08.902 --> 01:10.945
let's use the pay phones, huh?

01:11.446 --> 01:14.074
Badly located throughout this facility.

01:15.158 --> 01:18.912
Item 15 regards one Jesse John Hudson.

01:19.370 --> 01:22.040
After seven years of incarceration
at the Lafayette Facility,

01:22.123 --> 01:24.667
Mr. Hudson is back on the street.

01:25.460 --> 01:28.505
His release has generated
considerable anxiety

01:28.588 --> 01:31.257
gang-wise, streetwise, and otherwise,

01:31.341 --> 01:36.096
so, uh, let's keep our eyes and ears open
for any rumbles of discontent.

01:36.554 --> 01:39.641
Item 16, another cabbie
was robbed and beaten

01:39.724 --> 01:41.643
in the Avenue B Overpass
at People's Parkway.

01:41.726 --> 01:44.479
That makes six in the past week.

01:44.562 --> 01:47.565
We do not as yet have
a reliable description of this assailant,

01:48.149 --> 01:52.320
so be particularly alert
to any loose talk on the street.

01:52.862 --> 01:57.742
PHIL: All right, the last item, uh,
is the Laskey Avenue purse snatcher.

01:57.826 --> 02:04.374
Now the suspect is described
as being approximately 3'8" tall.

02:04.457 --> 02:08.920
-(laughing)
-Very long arms, hirsute in the extremis,

02:09.003 --> 02:11.548
and uncommonly fleet of foot.

02:11.631 --> 02:14.467
-(laughing)
-WOMAN: Sounds like my cousin Archie.

02:14.551 --> 02:18.304
In fact, the said
alleged perpetrator is, uh...

02:19.764 --> 02:22.517
a medium-size orangutan ape.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.395
-(laughing)
-WOMAN: It is my cousin Archie!

02:25.728 --> 02:30.441
Uh, guys, a personal aside,
I might add that while I, personally,

02:30.942 --> 02:33.695
have never encountered a felon
of the simian persuasion,

02:34.237 --> 02:36.823
these animals are known
to be extremely strong,

02:36.906 --> 02:38.283
extremely bright,

02:38.700 --> 02:40.368
and are not to be taken lightly.

02:41.119 --> 02:42.662
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

02:42.745 --> 02:46.207
-(all chattering)
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.212
Let's be careful out there.

02:51.296 --> 02:54.215
(clamoring)

02:54.299 --> 02:58.219
Lousy two-bit coward.
You're a lousy coward!

02:58.303 --> 02:59.554
MAN: Give me a break, will you?

02:59.637 --> 03:00.847
WOMAN: No-good--

03:00.930 --> 03:02.098
MAN: Yeah, that's right. Get hysterical.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.267
-That's the answer.
-You were born hysterical.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.351
Belker.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.353
(clamoring)

03:07.437 --> 03:08.438
Frank.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.273
I've got some messages for you.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.358
Smack me around again, you no-good--

03:12.442 --> 03:14.652
Lady, you ever stop to think
that maybe your mouth is--

03:14.736 --> 03:16.613
What is your problem?

03:16.696 --> 03:17.614
Man, let's go. We're not getting anywhere.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.032
-I don't need to hear--
-All right, lady.

03:19.115 --> 03:20.783
-It's not our problem.
-It's not our case!

03:20.867 --> 03:21.784
Officer Schnitz--

03:21.868 --> 03:24.913
Your client will be along momentarily,
Miss Davenport.

03:25.747 --> 03:26.915
Give me the light, Paul.

03:27.498 --> 03:30.835
You want to sit down, dog breath,
or would you prefer a collapsed lung?

03:30.919 --> 03:31.920
MAN: I don't know
what you're talking about.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.671
WOMAN: I'm gonna have you put away.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.757
You're going to put me away?
That's a laugh.

03:35.840 --> 03:36.716
You ought to be put away, you know that?

03:36.799 --> 03:40.178
-Name?
-Steve. Sam.

03:41.471 --> 03:42.680
(sarcastic laugh)

03:43.348 --> 03:45.975
That's the last time you're going
to slap me around, you bum.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.894
-MAN: Watch your mouth.
-I got your number,

03:47.977 --> 03:50.104
and my brother Ralph's got your number.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.814
Your brother Ralph's a drunk!
And I never touched her.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.274
I can't help it if she falls down a lot.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.985
How's that division paperwork
coming along, huh?

03:56.069 --> 03:58.655
-Fine, Sarge.
-Not so fine, Sarge.

03:58.738 --> 04:01.324
Fact is, we haven't started yet,
and I'm not gonna.

04:01.407 --> 04:02.825
-Joe.
-Look, Luce,

04:02.909 --> 04:05.161
I've had it up to my gums with paperwork.

04:05.662 --> 04:09.207
Sergeant, doc tells me my wing has got
almost 85 percent mobility,

04:09.290 --> 04:11.501
which is a hell of a lot better
than most guys that are healthy.

04:11.751 --> 04:12.961
So what do you say, huh?

04:13.044 --> 04:14.879
Well, you've only been back ten days.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.047
Keep your mouth shut.

04:16.381 --> 04:19.425
WOMAN: Sicko! You remember him, huh?
Lester Guber? Huh?

04:19.509 --> 04:21.886
Leo, would you mind, please?

04:21.970 --> 04:24.806
We're trying to carry
on a civilized conversation here. Leo!

04:24.889 --> 04:25.974
Would you get the door?

04:26.057 --> 04:27.767
-Now behave yourselves!
-(overlapping dialog)

04:27.850 --> 04:31.062
Look, everybody's been treating me
with rubber gloves or something.

04:31.479 --> 04:32.605
I was in 'Nam.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.024
I've been shot at before,
and it's not that big a deal.

04:35.358 --> 04:36.901
I don't mind being shot at.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.113
I'm not afraid to go back out there.

04:40.196 --> 04:42.115
You want me to tell him
about Lester Guber?

04:42.198 --> 04:43.992
MAN: Shut up. I'm warning you.
Keep your mouth shut.

04:44.075 --> 04:46.286
Lester Guber, you bag of wind.

04:46.369 --> 04:48.579
Lester Guber. Lester Guber!

04:48.663 --> 04:50.331
Lester Guber! Lester Guber!

04:50.415 --> 04:52.292
-Lester Guber! Lester Guber!
-Hey, hey!

04:52.375 --> 04:54.043
-(clamoring)
-MAN: Creep, shut up.

04:55.586 --> 04:57.380
You want me to tell them
how you break parole

04:57.463 --> 04:59.299
every day with Lester Guber, huh?

04:59.382 --> 05:00.258
-I'm going to kill her.
-WOMAN: Lester Guber!

05:00.341 --> 05:01.259
(clamoring)

05:01.342 --> 05:02.552
-Get your hands off of me!
-Lester Guber!

05:02.635 --> 05:03.761
Stay away from me!

05:03.845 --> 05:08.558
-(clamoring)
-(woman screaming)

05:09.267 --> 05:11.853
I'm going to kill her!
I'm going to kill her!

05:11.936 --> 05:13.896
-Gun!
-(screaming)

05:14.355 --> 05:16.024
(gunshots)

05:16.107 --> 05:17.233
(woman screaming)

05:24.073 --> 05:25.408
(woman sobbing)

05:55.730 --> 05:58.316
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch, we have a 9-11.</i>

05:59.067 --> 06:01.611
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>

06:01.694 --> 06:04.322
<i>corner of People's Drive</i>
<i>and 124th Street...</i>

06:04.405 --> 06:05.823
(sirens blaring)

06:11.287 --> 06:14.290
(theme music playing)

07:19.272 --> 07:20.982
PHIL: That's correct. That's correct.

07:28.322 --> 07:30.825
Uh, Francis, Internal Affairs
has been apprised.

07:30.908 --> 07:32.493
They're sending a team out right away.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.996
Good, Phil.
Get the paperwork started, would you?

07:35.079 --> 07:38.124
-Get maintenance up here, fix all this.
-Right.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.253
WOMAN: Okay, just give me
your number, and I'll get it.

07:45.256 --> 07:48.509
-All in one piece, counselor.
-Miss Downing?

07:51.387 --> 07:53.848
I'm Joyce Davenport,
public defender's office.

07:54.765 --> 07:56.976
Are you all right? Miss Downing?

07:58.019 --> 07:59.395
Hey, hang on a sec.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.105
OFFICER: She just passed out is all.

08:01.689 --> 08:04.108
Uh, maybe she needs
a little mouth-to-mouth.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.363
-Call the paramedics, right away.
-Get on the phone now.

08:10.865 --> 08:13.367
What the hell's going on here?
People are dropping like flies.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.703
I appreciate what you're saying, sir.
We want him--

08:15.786 --> 08:17.205
Yes, I'll hold.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.292
Yes, sir, but a composite won't do.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.252
Not if he's wearing disguises.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.588
-Captain.
-Yes, sir?

08:26.923 --> 08:28.257
Ah, one second, counselor.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.675
Uh, yeah, Carl.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.427
No, no, no, I haven't heard
from Hudson yet.

08:31.719 --> 08:36.182
We can try and provide some undercover,
but we're extremely short on manpower.

08:36.265 --> 08:39.185
Yes, I put out the word. I want him to--
Want him to come in for a talk.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.646
I hope so, too, but don't count on it.

08:41.729 --> 08:44.690
In the meantime, how about installing
one of those bullet separators

08:44.774 --> 08:47.485
between the passenger compartment
and the driver's?

08:47.568 --> 08:48.528
Yeah.

08:48.611 --> 08:49.695
RAY: Of course you're a taxpayer,
Mr. Tartaglia.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.489
Yes. Bye.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.951
-Counselor?
-I would very much like to know

08:55.034 --> 08:57.453
why my client just collapsed
on the floor out there.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.373
-So would I. Is that a booking slip?
-RAY: You bet, buster.

09:00.915 --> 09:03.876
(speaking Spanish)

09:03.960 --> 09:05.628
Susan Downing, soliciting sex act,

09:05.711 --> 09:07.505
resisting arrest,
assaulting a police officer,

09:07.588 --> 09:09.590
possession of a narcotic substance.

09:09.674 --> 09:10.925
Regular princess.

09:11.008 --> 09:13.970
What's that got to do
with this department's chronic disregard

09:14.053 --> 09:16.138
of its prisoners' physical well-being?

09:16.222 --> 09:17.473
<i>Bozo!</i>

09:18.266 --> 09:19.559
We'll have her checked out. Ray.

09:19.892 --> 09:20.810
Yes, Frank.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.311
Would you, uh...

09:23.521 --> 09:24.647
Miss Davenport.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.694
We're a little testy, aren't we?

09:30.194 --> 09:32.822
We don't, as a rule,
get shot at before lunch.

09:34.365 --> 09:36.075
Stick around and you may get used to it.

09:36.158 --> 09:37.827
You taking me out to dinner tonight?

09:39.078 --> 09:42.123
I've made a reservation
for 8:00 at Gianni's.

09:43.165 --> 09:45.710
-Isn't that a little expensive?
-Mm-hmm.

09:46.085 --> 09:49.213
It's your birthday, pizza man.
I feel like splurging.

09:50.881 --> 09:54.594
Maybe later I'll let you cite me
for soliciting a police officer.

10:03.644 --> 10:07.023
PHIL: Yes, ma'am, he's seven years old,
and he's been missing for 24 hours.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.733
-I've got that.
-(phone ringing)

10:08.816 --> 10:12.111
Oh, yes, ma'am, we'll dispatch
two officers immediately.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.866
Oh, Hill, Renko,
we have a missing 7-year-old.

10:16.949 --> 10:17.992
Here's the address.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.452
Have him back by noon.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.080
Sarge, what do you say?

10:23.664 --> 10:27.293
All right, you and Bates take unit 12,
parking shift.

10:27.918 --> 10:30.671
-Great.
-Oh! Joe.

10:31.797 --> 10:34.342
-WOMAN: Buy me a cup?
-(indistinct chattering)

10:42.600 --> 10:45.478
-If I may have a cup?
-Hello, Grace.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.106
Oh, I longed for you last night.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.817
All those nude encounter groups

10:51.901 --> 10:55.237
mean so much more to me
with you lying by my side.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.906
PHIL: Parakeet,
you know I would have been there

10:56.989 --> 10:59.992
if I didn't have to fill in
for Brewer on the night shift.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.620
Can you get away for an hour? Now?

11:03.037 --> 11:05.206
My plane leaves for Los Angeles
at three o'clock.

11:05.289 --> 11:07.792
Oh, Grace, I can't.

11:09.377 --> 11:13.547
I want your body pressing against mine,

11:14.215 --> 11:16.425
fulfilling me as only you can.

11:17.051 --> 11:18.177
PHIL: Grace...

11:22.348 --> 11:25.434
Anyway, here are the keys to my apartment.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.396
Feed the cat, water the plants,
sleep in my bed,

11:28.479 --> 11:30.564
and if you get lonely,
you need only call Celeste.

11:30.648 --> 11:31.649
She's a good friend.

11:31.732 --> 11:36.529
She knows all about us, and I trust her
to fulfill your needs in my absence.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.739
PHIL: Hey, Grace, what are you saying?

11:39.240 --> 11:42.410
Phil, you know I'm not a jealous woman.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.663
Sharing you doesn't diminish me.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.709
There's so much of you to share.

11:51.669 --> 11:53.462
Ooh.

11:55.131 --> 11:58.884
-(indistinct chatter)
-(phone ringing)

12:02.888 --> 12:04.390
Always sad, Phil.

12:05.141 --> 12:08.102
-Yes, Howard?
-Always sad, partings.

12:08.936 --> 12:09.979
I know how you must be feeling.

12:10.062 --> 12:13.774
My Lorraine is leaving
the country for two months.

12:14.233 --> 12:17.611
Well, frankly, Howard, it's a relief.
I'm exhausted.

12:17.695 --> 12:21.031
I tell you,
the woman's a sexual juggernaut.

12:22.032 --> 12:24.285
Last weekend, we went to Sand Creek.

12:25.327 --> 12:30.166
That rustic sex clinic place up north
where everybody's...<i> au naturel?</i>

12:30.249 --> 12:31.542
I don't mind telling you, Howard.

12:31.625 --> 12:35.671
Naked men and women of all persuasions
lying around.

12:36.005 --> 12:39.008
-Nude dance contests!
-Judas...

12:41.093 --> 12:41.969
I knew it was time to leave

12:42.052 --> 12:44.305
when a naked man asked me
to do the Lindy Hop.

12:44.388 --> 12:45.389
(spits)

12:46.807 --> 12:51.729
Last night, we were supposed to go out
to a nude Reichian encounter group.

12:53.022 --> 12:56.942
I begged off and went out to a bar,
had a few beers with a guy I met

12:57.026 --> 12:59.195
who runs the fish and tackle department
at Abernathy,

12:59.278 --> 13:01.489
-Luke McAllister. Great guy.
-Mm.

13:02.072 --> 13:03.532
Divorced, grown kids.

13:03.616 --> 13:07.620
We threw a few darts,
talked politics, sports.

13:07.703 --> 13:11.791
I'd forgotten the simple pleasures
of male camaraderie.

13:13.501 --> 13:16.378
You're not thinking
of breaking up with her,

13:17.213 --> 13:18.214
are you?

13:18.297 --> 13:20.299
Well, it's been on my mind.

13:21.550 --> 13:24.929
On the one hand,
her sense of adventure, sexually speaking,

13:25.012 --> 13:27.473
is unmatched by any woman I've ever known.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.936
However, on the plus side,
she's kind, generous,

13:32.019 --> 13:35.064
loyal in the<i> extremis,</i>
and a great conversationalist,

13:35.147 --> 13:36.649
not unlike your Lorraine.

13:38.275 --> 13:40.319
Oh, Lorraine. (clears throat) Well...

13:41.737 --> 13:44.698
unfortunately, our relationship
is on a much loftier plane.

13:44.782 --> 13:47.368
We go to concerts, gallery openings.

13:47.910 --> 13:50.287
Last weekend, we went rowing on Taft Lake.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.331
Hmm, that sounds relaxing.

13:53.374 --> 13:56.836
Frankly, Phil, I would have preferred
something a little more uplifting,

13:56.919 --> 13:58.254
if you take my thrust.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.172
(chuckles)

14:00.256 --> 14:01.966
These things take time, Howard.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.592
She'll come around.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.678
(sighs) Well, I hope so.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.139
I find myself in a painful state...

14:10.683 --> 14:11.976
celibacy-wise.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.019
Sex.

14:14.311 --> 14:16.689
-(exhales)
-Ironic, isn't it?

14:17.231 --> 14:19.525
I have more than I know what to do with,

14:20.276 --> 14:21.777
and you can't get arrested.

14:27.741 --> 14:31.036
(radio chatters)

14:44.466 --> 14:45.509
Hey, Ray.

14:45.593 --> 14:46.886
Did she give you the photos of the boy?

14:46.969 --> 14:49.263
Yeah, two, uh, taken half a year ago.

14:49.346 --> 14:51.765
Couple hundred prints
are being made by the lab.

14:51.849 --> 14:52.892
Cute little peckerwood, isn't he?

14:52.975 --> 14:55.269
He looks like sort
of a miniature Trini Lopez.

14:55.477 --> 14:57.146
Is that all you have on that ex-boyfriend?

14:57.229 --> 14:59.982
Well, she claims he got real Latino on her

15:00.065 --> 15:02.151
one night she tried
to give him the pink slip.

15:04.194 --> 15:06.530
-LaRue, Washington.
-NEAL: Yes, Lieutenant.

15:09.283 --> 15:12.244
Let's pull in her ex-boyfriend
for questioning.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.163
Name, Jorge Alonzo.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.372
Get an address on that, babe?

15:15.456 --> 15:18.125
No, uh, she doesn't know
where he's living now,

15:18.208 --> 15:20.544
but she did write down
a few names of bars that he hung out in.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.796
Ray, you know,
this was supposed to be our lead--

15:22.880 --> 15:24.423
I've already got a job for you.

15:24.506 --> 15:26.800
He'll make it something
real strategic, Renko.

15:26.884 --> 15:27.718
Door to door.

15:27.801 --> 15:29.803
You know, if you don't happen to show up

15:29.887 --> 15:33.223
by happy hour there, J.D.,
maybe I'll put an APB out

15:33.307 --> 15:35.726
-on that wagon you've been riding in.
-Okay, okay, okay, that's enough of that.

15:35.809 --> 15:38.979
See that, Neal? I'm smiling.
Doesn't faze me a bit.

15:39.688 --> 15:40.606
Come on, John.

15:41.565 --> 15:43.943
We got those pictures of the boy
back from the lab, Lieutenant.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.110
Good.

15:45.653 --> 15:48.656
After you hand them out,
I want you, Cauley, and Lyle

15:48.739 --> 15:50.658
to check out all the local playgrounds

15:50.741 --> 15:53.911
within Redmond, Lynwood,
Forest, and North.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.246
-And don't forget the park.
-Right.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.207
What a face.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.167
Looks like Trini Lopez.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.711
WOMAN (on radio):<i> Alonzo,</i>
<i>clear in City and State--</i>

16:02.795 --> 16:04.004
Coffey, Bates.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.923
RAY: You're going to be
assisting Hill and Renko

16:06.006 --> 16:07.716
in a door-to-door canvass
of the neighborhood.

16:08.092 --> 16:11.470
Every building and vacant lot
within two blocks of here.

16:12.012 --> 16:14.223
-Yes, sir.
-I think it's very important

16:14.306 --> 16:17.267
we must find him
before the night shift takes over.

16:19.269 --> 16:20.938
<i>No comprendo, gordito.</i>

16:21.021 --> 16:23.440
LaRue and Washington
get the martini circuit,

16:23.732 --> 16:26.235
Ellis and Perez get to take
a stroll in the park,

16:26.610 --> 16:28.070
-but what do you and me get?
-JOE: Let's go.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.989
A walking tour of the Third World.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.657
Hey, now this--

16:41.000 --> 16:42.876
Captain, about this morning...

16:42.960 --> 16:45.004
-It wasn't your fault, Alf.
-It was my gun.

16:45.587 --> 16:47.256
Did you give your statement to IA?

16:47.464 --> 16:49.800
Then forget about it.
Could have been any one of us.

16:50.884 --> 16:51.802
Okay, Captain.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.056
Frank, Jesse John Hudson's on his way in.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.808
Good, Henry.
Bring him to my office, will you?

16:57.891 --> 16:58.726
Right.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.771
There's been a good deal of anxiety up
on the Hill of late, Mr. Hudson.

17:03.564 --> 17:06.525
Word has it, you might want
to pick up where you left off.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.444
Let me assure you, Captain,

17:09.111 --> 17:10.487
I'm not your enemy.

17:11.280 --> 17:14.158
Besides, where I left off
was the summer of '74,

17:14.658 --> 17:16.160
the days of rage.

17:16.243 --> 17:18.370
You weren't up here then,
but there were brothers

17:18.454 --> 17:20.456
shot down wholesale in the street.

17:20.914 --> 17:25.210
Only a fool or a madman
would want to pick up where I left off.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.504
Hudson's taking over the Arrow again.

17:28.922 --> 17:31.050
Anyone that stands in his way
is a dead man.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.551
(scoffs) Come on.

17:33.177 --> 17:37.014
Hey, the present warlord
and two of his lieutenants

17:37.097 --> 17:39.016
disappeared sometime last night.

17:40.100 --> 17:42.853
If they ever turn up, it'll probably be
in a crate somewhere.

17:45.189 --> 17:47.566
He's something else entirely, man.

17:47.649 --> 17:49.818
(tires screeching)

17:52.988 --> 17:57.701
The Black Arrow must number 200 at least
of the baddest dudes in this town.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.245
He's reclaiming it
like it was his birthright.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.539
I understand your concerns, Captain,

18:03.582 --> 18:05.501
but the goals of the inner city

18:05.834 --> 18:08.462
and those of the Black Arrow
haven't really changed

18:08.545 --> 18:09.797
since the mid-'70s,

18:09.880 --> 18:13.467
but I can assure you
there's been a profound change

18:13.550 --> 18:15.177
in the method of attainment.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.097
-It's in my book.
-I read it.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.849
HUDSON: Well, then,
you know my philosophy.

18:21.391 --> 18:25.187
What are your goals, Mr. Hudson?
I couldn't quite get them from the book.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.481
Change from within.

18:28.482 --> 18:32.277
Things like voting blocs
for municipal elections,

18:32.361 --> 18:36.698
a privately-financed credit union
for local retailers,

18:36.782 --> 18:40.869
work-study programs
for Black Arrow-owned businesses,

18:40.953 --> 18:43.205
free health clinics, and so on.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.958
Drugs, numbers,

18:46.500 --> 18:49.878
enforced protection, loan sharking,

18:50.462 --> 18:52.172
phony credit unions.

18:53.549 --> 18:56.426
He's developing a regular
five-point program for the '80s.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.971
So is every other
dirt ball gang on the Hill.

18:59.346 --> 19:00.472
Yeah.

19:01.348 --> 19:03.433
Just don't underestimate him, Belker.

19:03.851 --> 19:04.935
Why not?

19:05.936 --> 19:07.020
He might have gone up the river

19:07.104 --> 19:10.107
your basic storefront
armed robber revolutionary,

19:10.190 --> 19:14.153
but he's come back
a politically savvy dude.

19:14.778 --> 19:17.698
He's learned to work the system
like a ten-dollar hooker, man.

19:18.073 --> 19:19.449
That makes him dangerous.

19:23.203 --> 19:25.455
Okay, I'll relay
that to the captain, Virgil.

19:25.539 --> 19:26.707
Yeah.

19:27.624 --> 19:32.379
You tell him Hudson's not after
nickels and dimes this time, man.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.424
He wants the Hill.

19:39.553 --> 19:42.055
Look, here's my numbers.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.600
You can reach me any time night or day.

19:44.933 --> 19:46.476
It might surprise you, Captain,

19:47.144 --> 19:49.313
but I think we both want the same thing.

19:56.945 --> 19:58.530
(telephone rings)

20:03.619 --> 20:04.620
What do you think, Henry?

20:05.204 --> 20:06.580
He's got a lot of presence.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.041
I don't know, Frank.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.084
I think he's on the level.

20:12.502 --> 20:15.255
In case you forgot,
he beat a man to death.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.590
I know that, Frank.

20:18.091 --> 20:20.761
You may not want to hear this right now,
but I've been talking to a lot of people

20:20.844 --> 20:23.222
about Hudson these past couple of weeks.

20:23.972 --> 20:25.098
Maybe he changed.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.648
I don't trust him
as far as I can throw him.

20:32.898 --> 20:36.693
FAY:<i> ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

20:36.777 --> 20:40.614
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

20:40.697 --> 20:46.286
<i>♪ Happy birthday</i>
<i>Dear Francis Xavier Furillo ♪</i>

20:46.370 --> 20:47.996
-Xavier?
-You didn't hear that.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.958
ALL:<i> ♪ Happy birthday ♪</i>

20:51.041 --> 20:54.544
<i>♪ To you ♪</i>

20:54.628 --> 20:57.839
-All right.
-(applause)

20:57.923 --> 20:59.549
-How are you?
-Fine.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.260
-How's Rachel?
-She's great. We're both great.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.761
Oh, good.

21:02.844 --> 21:05.597
Happy birthday, Francis Xavier.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.644
Happy birthday, Frank.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.896
-Thanks, Fay.
-(laughing)

21:13.605 --> 21:14.690
Go on, open it.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.233
(clears throat)

21:16.984 --> 21:19.903
(both laughing)

21:19.987 --> 21:21.697
Oh, Fay, it's terrific.

21:22.197 --> 21:23.573
Well, you know me.

21:23.657 --> 21:26.493
I just thought you'd like to share
some cake with your men.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.079
-It's good, too.
-Can you come by later?

21:29.162 --> 21:30.539
Frank Jr. has a present for you.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.582
-Sure.
-He made it in school.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.836
And if you could stay
for dinner, you know,

21:35.919 --> 21:39.381
you might be able to talk me into, uh,
who knows what.

21:39.923 --> 21:40.799
Hey, Frank,

21:41.842 --> 21:43.385
do you remember
when we were first married,

21:43.468 --> 21:47.389
that little something extra
I used to give you for your birthday?

21:50.642 --> 21:53.854
(clears throat) I wish I could stay, Fay,
but I have another date.

21:54.896 --> 22:00.110
Oh, well, it was just
a last-minute idea, you know?

22:00.694 --> 22:02.612
I didn't mean to put you
on the spot or anything.

22:02.696 --> 22:03.822
It's okay.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.450
It's just that, uh...

22:07.576 --> 22:09.369
I still miss you sometimes.

22:10.912 --> 22:11.955
Me too.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.332
(sighs)

22:14.875 --> 22:18.003
So, Frank, 40 years old.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.172
Well, how does that feel?

22:21.256 --> 22:24.676
-So far, so good.
-Yeah? Well, you look good.

22:25.719 --> 22:28.805
-No midlife crisis or anything?
-Who's got time around here?

22:29.222 --> 22:30.390
Sure.

22:31.975 --> 22:33.518
Well, um...

22:34.478 --> 22:35.645
you won't forget to come by, will you?

22:35.729 --> 22:39.066
I mean, Frank Jr.
would just be heartbroken if you did.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.692
Oh, I won't forget. I promise.

22:43.195 --> 22:46.198
Aw, Frank, happy birthday.

22:47.574 --> 22:51.286
I mean it.
I... I hope this is your best ever.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.747
I know you do. Thanks again.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.090
ALONZO: Hey, I'm clean, man.

23:03.173 --> 23:04.549
I haven't seen her and her kid in months.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.426
Hey, come on, Jorge,
we're just going to take you in

23:06.510 --> 23:07.511
for some routine questioning.

23:07.594 --> 23:09.137
Do I look like a kidnapper to you?

23:09.221 --> 23:10.806
Man, with your breath,
I don't think you could get

23:10.889 --> 23:12.474
close enough to anybody to kidnap them.

23:12.557 --> 23:15.060
-Don't you have any pride in yourself?
-Why are you getting so personal, man?

23:15.143 --> 23:16.561
I haven't done nothing to you.

23:18.188 --> 23:20.941
See, Neal, the first thing
to go in an alky is self-respect.

23:21.024 --> 23:22.734
Now, you take this nosebag here.

23:22.984 --> 23:25.028
He's got no self-respect

23:25.404 --> 23:28.907
and no self-esteem and a lousy self-image.

23:28.990 --> 23:31.952
Hey, I never pictured you
having a lousy self-image.

23:32.035 --> 23:34.204
Laughing on the outside, honey,
crying on the inside.

23:34.287 --> 23:35.497
(shouting)

23:35.580 --> 23:37.165
Hey, what are you doing,
you crazy or something?

23:37.624 --> 23:39.334
-(crash)
-MAN: Get out of here!

23:39.668 --> 23:41.086
Hey, what do you think, lover?

23:41.461 --> 23:43.046
Think we ought to go over there
before they kill each other?

23:43.588 --> 23:46.133
J.D.: Nah, save the small potatoes
for the uniforms, man.

23:46.216 --> 23:47.467
We're the big league,
you know what I mean?

23:47.551 --> 23:49.177
-(alarm ringing)
-Hey, is that big league

23:49.261 --> 23:50.345
enough for you, lover, huh?

23:53.807 --> 23:56.309
(clamoring)

23:56.393 --> 23:59.479
I've got a 10-30 at 160 Jefferson.

23:59.563 --> 24:04.401
In pursuit of a white-over-green car
heading east on 20th.

24:04.484 --> 24:07.487
-(tires squeal)
-(siren wailing)

24:11.032 --> 24:13.702
(siren wailing)

24:16.705 --> 24:18.707
(indistinct chatter)

24:23.712 --> 24:25.255
Glad you're here, Frank.

24:25.338 --> 24:27.507
(indistinct police radio chatter)

24:29.885 --> 24:31.845
Scenario-wise, LaRue and Washington

24:31.928 --> 24:34.806
have driven two armed
and dangerous miscreants

24:34.890 --> 24:36.766
into the bowels of this garage.

24:36.850 --> 24:38.560
Any civilians inside?

24:38.643 --> 24:39.478
Lieutenant!

24:41.646 --> 24:44.274
Damn it, listen, man, I'm a doctor,

24:44.357 --> 24:46.526
and I'm already running late as it is.

24:46.610 --> 24:49.613
I've got two operations waiting
for me at County General

24:49.696 --> 24:53.283
and a couple of herniated
nasal cases back at the office.

24:53.366 --> 24:54.951
-HOWARD: Where's your partner?
-MAN: What partner?

24:55.035 --> 24:56.119
Try the trunk, Howard.

24:56.203 --> 24:57.871
Port side here is a little low.

24:58.997 --> 25:01.416
(indistinct police radio chatter)

25:05.545 --> 25:06.838
Hmm.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.340
Ballantine, get the keys.

25:11.801 --> 25:14.721
No keys, sir.
He must have punched the ignition.

25:16.723 --> 25:18.266
Give me that bullhorn.

25:20.477 --> 25:22.729
You in there, this is the police.

25:22.812 --> 25:25.065
Come out with your hands up.
You're surrounded.

25:25.148 --> 25:26.983
MAN: What are you gonna do, golf ball?

25:28.318 --> 25:30.654
Get me that hose over there, Ballantine.
We'll flush him out.

25:30.737 --> 25:32.697
I hope you've got a scuba tank in there.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.991
MAN: It's not like that. I can't hear.
I've got an earache.

25:36.076 --> 25:39.746
Earache?
Ballantine, give me your flashlight.

25:40.914 --> 25:43.500
-Earache.
-(banging)

25:44.084 --> 25:46.878
MAN: Okay, okay, okay, come on,
let me out of here.

25:46.962 --> 25:49.965
-I give up. I'm coming out.
-My car! My car! That's my car.

25:50.048 --> 25:52.259
-MAN: Let me out!
-It's my car.

25:52.342 --> 25:54.636
This is your car? I assume
you have keys to this vehicle.

25:54.719 --> 25:57.639
I just bought this car.
You've ruined it, you fascist.

25:57.722 --> 25:58.932
MAN: Let me out of here!

25:59.015 --> 26:00.267
It's jammed.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.310
-Of course it is, you idiot.
-MAN: Let me out of here.

26:02.394 --> 26:03.937
Can you open it from the inside?

26:04.020 --> 26:06.273
MAN: I'm deaf, you know.
You made me deaf in here.

26:06.356 --> 26:10.318
Would you get me out, please?
I can't hear. I can't-- I can't think.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.778
I can't breathe. I can't do anything.

26:11.861 --> 26:13.989
Sensory deprivation, Frank.

26:14.072 --> 26:15.824
It's a potent weapon.

26:15.907 --> 26:17.492
All right, Ballantine,
I want you to take this vehicle

26:17.576 --> 26:21.454
down to the police garage
and have them spring this trunk lid open.

26:21.538 --> 26:22.998
I have friends in the department.

26:23.081 --> 26:24.791
I play racquetball with Chief Daniels.

26:24.874 --> 26:27.210
You'll rue the day you messed
with Dr. Sidney Sackheim.

26:27.294 --> 26:28.461
MAN: Let me out!

26:29.588 --> 26:30.964
Sackheim. Is that an American name?

26:31.047 --> 26:32.549
(indistinct chatter)

26:43.143 --> 26:45.228
-How's your client?
-Rocky.

26:46.021 --> 26:48.565
A combination of no sleep,
nerves, low blood sugar.

26:48.648 --> 26:49.691
She'll be all right.

26:50.066 --> 26:51.234
Then what am I doing here?

26:51.568 --> 26:54.154
I thought you should hear
what she has to say firsthand.

26:54.696 --> 26:55.989
(buzzes)

26:56.448 --> 26:59.909
WOMAN (on P.A.):
<i>Dr. Marcus, emergency room stat.</i>

26:59.993 --> 27:01.411
<i>Dr. Marcus.</i>

27:07.459 --> 27:09.419
Susan, this is Captain Furillo.

27:10.045 --> 27:11.004
Great.

27:13.173 --> 27:15.216
JOYCE: I want you to tell him
exactly what you told me

27:15.300 --> 27:16.343
about Ben Lambert.

27:16.968 --> 27:18.136
What's the point?

27:18.970 --> 27:20.513
I'm pressed for time, Counselor.

27:20.597 --> 27:21.973
Susan, please.

27:25.852 --> 27:29.314
I work nights as a topless waitress
at the Cat O' Nine Tails.

27:30.482 --> 27:33.735
This guy, uh, Lambert's
been coming in for a couple of weeks.

27:34.027 --> 27:37.238
Seemed like a nice guy. He was kinda shy.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.699
Held his liquor,
but I knew he'd make a move.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.034
It was just a matter of when.

27:41.117 --> 27:44.663
So, finally, last night, after closing,

27:45.538 --> 27:46.665
he stopped me in the parking lot

27:46.748 --> 27:49.167
and asked me if I wanted
to go out for a cup of coffee.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.545
"Just coffee," he said.
"That's it. I promise."

27:53.755 --> 27:55.548
SUSAN (sighs): I should've known better.

27:55.882 --> 27:58.385
Tell the captain what happened
when you got in his car.

28:01.221 --> 28:02.597
He was like a different man.

28:04.557 --> 28:08.019
The second I got in, he offered me money
to have sex with him,

28:08.770 --> 28:11.189
and when I said no
and tried to get out of the car,

28:11.272 --> 28:13.983
he grabbed me and stuffed money
down my shirt.

28:14.359 --> 28:17.946
And then he said he was a cop,
and if I didn't...

28:19.572 --> 28:22.200
He said if she didn't fellate him,
he'd arrest her.

28:26.788 --> 28:28.456
I'm filing a complaint
with Internal Affairs

28:28.540 --> 28:31.042
and the Citizens' Review Board
for harassment, false arrest,

28:31.126 --> 28:32.711
and anything else I can think of.

28:33.044 --> 28:35.046
We're also contemplating
criminal assault charges

28:35.130 --> 28:37.882
against Ben Lambert as well as
a civil suit against the department.

28:37.966 --> 28:39.843
This guy has pushed his authority, Frank,
and we're pushing back.

28:39.926 --> 28:42.220
Whose interest is being represented here,
yours or your client's?

28:42.303 --> 28:43.430
Both.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.265
Lambert ought to be nailed to a cross.

28:45.348 --> 28:47.684
If he's guilty.
But consider your client's record,

28:47.767 --> 28:49.269
she's a topless waitress.

28:49.352 --> 28:50.729
We'll run a check on her, of course,

28:50.812 --> 28:52.981
but I'd be willing to bet
she's not exactly a débutante.

28:53.064 --> 28:55.066
Are you suggesting a different set
of legal standards

28:55.150 --> 28:55.984
for topless waitresses?

28:56.067 --> 28:58.319
I also seem to recall
a charge of possession

28:58.403 --> 28:59.237
on her arrest sheet.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.989
Is she claiming that's a lie, too?

29:01.072 --> 29:03.908
A physician's sample
of amphetamines, diet pills.

29:05.785 --> 29:07.662
I've got a feeling on this one, Frank.

29:07.746 --> 29:11.833
Call it woman's intuition, if you will,
but I'm going to take it all the way.

29:13.251 --> 29:14.753
I just wanted you to know, that's all.

29:14.836 --> 29:17.046
I have intuition, too.
It's called cop's intuition.

29:17.130 --> 29:18.965
Mm. You think she's lying.

29:19.048 --> 29:20.967
I believe she believes
she's telling the truth.

29:21.050 --> 29:23.845
I also believe that's not
necessarily the same as the truth.

29:24.387 --> 29:26.347
As long as we both acknowledge
that the truth

29:26.431 --> 29:29.726
is not a monopoly held by Ben Lambert
or the department he works for.

29:29.809 --> 29:31.728
That's why we have courts, counselor.

29:31.811 --> 29:33.980
Eight o'clock, Gianni's. Come hungry.

29:39.611 --> 29:42.489
(TV game show music playing)

29:42.572 --> 29:45.200
(audience cheering)

29:47.869 --> 29:49.412
MAN:<i> Hi, everybody, and welcome back again</i>

29:49.496 --> 29:50.997
<i>to </i>You Bet Your Nanny,
<i>the show that goes...</i>

29:54.751 --> 29:56.961
-Hello?
-WOMAN: Who is it?

29:57.045 --> 29:58.046
Police, ma'am.

30:00.632 --> 30:01.800
(locks rattling)

30:01.883 --> 30:04.594
If that Black no-account woman
done called y'all on me,

30:04.677 --> 30:09.224
well, I don't know what she been saying,
'cause I listens to my television loud.

30:09.307 --> 30:11.267
I'm hard of hearing in one of my ears.

30:11.351 --> 30:14.103
-Could we just talk to you for a moment?
-What?

30:14.813 --> 30:18.274
Have you seen this child
in the last 24 hours?

30:20.276 --> 30:21.611
No. Who is he?

30:21.903 --> 30:23.696
He's missing from home. Have you seen him?

30:23.780 --> 30:24.864
No, I ain't seen him.

30:24.948 --> 30:26.991
How come he ain't home with his mama?

30:27.700 --> 30:30.954
There are eight million stories
in the naked city.

30:31.037 --> 30:32.163
Well, this is going nowhere.

30:32.247 --> 30:33.998
-Did you guys check the basement?
-Yeah.

30:34.082 --> 30:36.960
Your basic rodential habitat.
I hate to be a pessimist,

30:37.043 --> 30:38.503
but I think this kid's a goner.

30:38.586 --> 30:39.963
Will you quit it, Renko?

30:40.421 --> 30:42.841
Come on, Luce,
I'm only trying to tell you like it is.

30:42.924 --> 30:44.759
He's seven years old,
he's been missing for--

30:44.843 --> 30:47.262
Let's go check the top floor.

30:47.345 --> 30:48.513
RENKO: Can you figure it out?

30:48.596 --> 30:49.514
Officer B--

30:50.974 --> 30:52.392
LUCY: It's a orang--

30:53.351 --> 30:55.144
Well, bite my shorts.

30:55.228 --> 30:57.689
-It's the Laskey Avenue purse snatcher.
-MAN: Run for it, baby!

30:58.481 --> 30:59.941
-I got him!
-Hey, man. Hey!

31:00.024 --> 31:01.109
(clamoring)

31:01.651 --> 31:03.152
I'll get the monkey! I'll get him!

31:03.236 --> 31:04.612
-RENKO: What?
-LUCY: Joe, I got the back!

31:04.696 --> 31:07.615
Hey, you! Hey, don't you swing down there
like that! Come on!

31:08.283 --> 31:11.286
(clamoring)

31:17.125 --> 31:18.668
Where?

31:19.669 --> 31:20.753
Hey, you!

31:20.837 --> 31:23.548
-RENKO: You knock that off, you gibbon!
-BOBBY: Come on, let's grab him!

31:23.631 --> 31:26.050
No, you grab him.
I'm not going to arrest no ape!

31:26.134 --> 31:28.177
First of all, they're stronger
than a whale's breath,

31:28.261 --> 31:30.847
and second of all,
you can't toilet train 'em.

31:36.686 --> 31:38.813
We got our man. Where's yours?

31:40.273 --> 31:41.983
Our "man" got away.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.027
Yeah, well, we sure wish
we could stay with you

31:44.110 --> 31:46.779
on this door-to-door,
but we got to take our suspect in.

31:46.863 --> 31:48.615
(indistinct police radio chatter)

31:48.698 --> 31:49.699
Catch you later.

31:55.288 --> 31:57.040
RAY: What about O'Keefe and DiCarlo?

31:57.123 --> 32:01.377
I have Hill and Renko, Cauley and Lyle,
Panahuski and Tepas,

32:01.461 --> 32:04.631
RAY (over phone):<i> Coffey and Bates,</i>
<i>all of them looking for him.</i>

32:04.714 --> 32:07.425
(indistinct)

32:07.508 --> 32:10.929
And Colin Avenue
from 118th Street to 125th.

32:11.012 --> 32:13.014
I got to have more.

32:13.097 --> 32:14.682
Well, I can't leave the park barren,

32:14.766 --> 32:17.685
but let me see if can pull
some uniforms from Midtown.

32:18.353 --> 32:21.898
And I'll see if I can't spring
Goldblume as well. How's it looking?

32:21.981 --> 32:24.275
LaRue and Washington
picked up the boyfriend.

32:24.859 --> 32:26.736
Mrs. Castillo, is there
anything else you'd like to say?

32:27.570 --> 32:29.822
MRS. CASTILLO: If anyone
knows where my son is...

32:29.906 --> 32:32.033
Well, let me see if I can get
some more bodies for you.

32:32.116 --> 32:33.743
I appreciate that, Phil.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.705
MAN 1: I think that'll be it
for us, you know?

32:37.789 --> 32:39.082
MAN 2: Yeah, I guess that's a wrap.

32:39.165 --> 32:40.041
MAN 1: Let's get all
the cable out of here.

32:40.124 --> 32:41.292
All right, let's go.

32:42.877 --> 32:45.546
We're getting more officers,
Mrs. Castillo.

32:47.006 --> 32:49.342
He wouldn't be gone this long
unless something bad had happened.

32:49.425 --> 32:50.343
I know it.

32:52.095 --> 32:54.263
He always tells me where he's going.

32:55.223 --> 32:58.518
(sobbing) I hope he's all right.

32:58.851 --> 33:00.853
RAY: We never know with the little ones.

33:01.771 --> 33:03.856
RENKO: Y'all just get up your gumption
and let's get down here.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.025
HILL: I swear, Renko, if there
are rats down here, I'm leaving.

33:06.109 --> 33:07.527
RENKO: Well, then,
you got to get used to it, man,

33:07.610 --> 33:10.780
because rats are an ecological
reality of big city life.

33:10.863 --> 33:12.073
HILL: I can't stand 'em, man.

33:12.156 --> 33:14.575
The way they look at you
with those beady little marble eyes.

33:14.659 --> 33:15.743
RENKO: You mean like this here?

33:15.827 --> 33:17.787
Come on, Renko, stop joking around.

33:19.664 --> 33:22.000
-Oh, man.
-What?

33:22.083 --> 33:23.418
Smell that.

33:24.127 --> 33:24.961
Rats.

33:25.044 --> 33:29.132
No, that ain't no rat.
That's a human, Renko.

33:33.761 --> 33:36.180
(clattering)

33:36.264 --> 33:38.349
I'm not doing anything.
I'm not doing anything.

33:47.525 --> 33:48.526
God...

33:50.486 --> 33:52.697
don't let that smell be
what I think it is.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.575
Oh, no, man, no, no.

33:55.658 --> 33:56.743
The first thing you do

33:56.826 --> 33:58.536
is tell a kid not to go
into a thing like this.

33:58.619 --> 34:00.705
(coughing)

34:02.874 --> 34:05.084
-There's something in there, Bobby.
-I know it.

34:05.376 --> 34:07.462
-Open it.
-Oh, no.

34:07.545 --> 34:08.421
Open it!

34:12.175 --> 34:15.845
-Oh, my God.
-(Renko coughing)

34:16.554 --> 34:17.847
(knocking on door)

34:18.473 --> 34:19.307
Yeah, Phil.

34:19.724 --> 34:22.852
Uh, we got an ID on that deceased
Hill and Renko found.

34:24.020 --> 34:26.230
Clayton Hicks, warlord of the Black Arrow.

34:26.314 --> 34:29.108
I could've told you that, Frankie.

34:29.192 --> 34:33.821
You people sitting on your thumbs,
you'll be finding a lot of VIPs on ice.

34:33.905 --> 34:34.739
Dobbs and Hernandez

34:34.822 --> 34:36.532
from the Gang Intervention Unit
are here to see you.

34:36.616 --> 34:39.702
Oh, wow. Gang Intervention.

34:39.994 --> 34:42.080
Heavy, Frankie. Heavy.

34:42.705 --> 34:45.124
Thanks, Phil. I should be through
in here in just a minute.

34:45.208 --> 34:46.209
Mm-hmm.

34:54.008 --> 34:57.887
Okay, Jesus, let's assume
that Jesse John Hudson

34:57.970 --> 35:00.223
is trying to regain control
of the Black Arrow.

35:01.057 --> 35:02.642
What's the plan? What's he after?

35:02.975 --> 35:06.312
What's he after?
I'm surprised at you, Frankie.

35:06.395 --> 35:11.234
Here you are, a college graduate,
a seemingly streetwise person,

35:11.526 --> 35:13.736
and you don't know what Hudson's after?

35:14.112 --> 35:15.321
Educate me.

35:15.655 --> 35:18.574
He's after your turf, bro.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.369
My sources tell me he's after yours.

35:21.911 --> 35:23.996
Where do you suppose
he'll make his first move?

35:25.248 --> 35:28.501
If I was him, I would probably
cross over to Dekker Avenue,

35:28.584 --> 35:30.711
put the squeeze on the Shamrocks.

35:30.795 --> 35:34.423
Those potato heads talk a good game,
but one look at Hudson,

35:34.507 --> 35:37.343
and they'll go running back
to catechism class.

35:37.426 --> 35:40.179
-Likewise the Gypsies.
-And the Diablos?

35:41.180 --> 35:43.683
Protective reaction, Frankie.

35:43.766 --> 35:48.312
We'll smack his butt before he even thinks
past 125th street.

35:49.105 --> 35:50.857
It's an interesting scenario, Jesus,

35:50.940 --> 35:53.109
but trust me,
I'll never let it go that far.

35:53.192 --> 35:54.026
(banging on door)

35:54.944 --> 35:56.946
-JESUS: Yo, Louie.
-(speaks Spanish) ...bro.

35:57.029 --> 35:58.030
Oh,<i> gracias, </i>bro.

36:00.324 --> 36:02.118
I hate to break this up, bro,

36:02.201 --> 36:04.912
but I promised to pick up
my mother over at the dentist.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.206
Listen, Jesus, how about
working with me on this one

36:07.290 --> 36:09.000
before it gets too far out of hand?

36:09.083 --> 36:12.962
Yo, Furillo, you draw a salary.
What do I get out of this?

36:13.045 --> 36:15.506
A little peace in the neighborhood,
that's all I'm offering.

36:15.756 --> 36:18.259
I already have peace, Frankie.

36:18.759 --> 36:21.262
But if it comes to war,
I'll take that, too.

36:21.345 --> 36:24.974
Oh, come on, Jesus, you know
nobody wins that kind of war.

36:26.309 --> 36:28.269
What I do know, Frankie,

36:28.352 --> 36:32.064
is that the only way to avoid
a war with Jesse John Hudson

36:32.148 --> 36:33.191
is to kill him.

36:33.691 --> 36:35.818
You know that, too, bro.

36:42.658 --> 36:46.037
Yo, Furillo,
don't let the shadows get you.

36:52.293 --> 36:55.671
-(indistinct chatter)
-(phone ringing)

36:55.755 --> 36:58.591
WOMAN: I think Belker's got a new date.

37:00.009 --> 37:02.011
-Nice collar, Mick.
-Thank you.

37:02.094 --> 37:05.431
-That's no collar, that's family.
-You're on thin ice, dirt ball.

37:05.514 --> 37:07.225
Sit down, hair bag.

37:07.767 --> 37:09.227
(grunting)

37:11.270 --> 37:14.232
(indistinct chatter)

37:15.691 --> 37:18.194
MAN: What is that smell?
What is that smell?

37:19.403 --> 37:21.948
(grunting)

37:25.243 --> 37:26.369
Okay.

37:31.749 --> 37:33.000
You like onions?

37:38.756 --> 37:40.216
(grunting)

37:40.841 --> 37:43.344
(laughing)

37:50.226 --> 37:52.311
MICK: Name? (laughs)

37:52.812 --> 37:55.231
(telephone rings)

37:57.858 --> 37:58.776
Hill Street Station.

37:58.859 --> 38:00.736
MAN (on phone):
<i>Yeah, Officer Hill, please.</i>

38:00.820 --> 38:01.821
Yeah, this is Hill.

38:01.904 --> 38:03.281
(indistinct chatter)

38:03.364 --> 38:07.994
Was that refrigerator we pulled that boy
out of a top-loading type or a side-load?

38:08.077 --> 38:09.120
Oh, it was front.

38:09.495 --> 38:12.999
Yeah, what's your name?
Where's the pencil? Pencil.

38:13.082 --> 38:16.585
Well, stop it. I refuse
to be manipulated that way.

38:16.669 --> 38:19.964
GRACE (over phone):<i> I'm sitting here</i>
<i>dressed in velour. Are you aroused?</i>

38:20.047 --> 38:21.382
No, I'm not aroused.

38:21.465 --> 38:24.510
<i>I could fix that for you. I really could.</i>

38:24.593 --> 38:28.139
For pennies' sake, woman,
this is a public utility.

38:28.222 --> 38:29.765
(indistinct)

38:29.849 --> 38:30.850
Ugh.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.396
-Phil.
-Oh, hiya, Mac.

38:35.479 --> 38:36.647
Why so tense?

38:37.648 --> 38:39.483
Hey, what brings you up here?

38:39.567 --> 38:42.737
Well, nothing really, just a couple
of 50-yard-line red zone tickets

38:42.820 --> 38:43.988
for the Monday night game.

38:44.071 --> 38:45.781
Oh, you got 'em. That's terrific.

38:48.617 --> 38:51.203
Listen, buddy, look, something's wrong.
You want to talk about it?

38:52.705 --> 38:57.001
Well, Mac, I'm irresistible to women.

38:57.335 --> 38:58.878
They can't leave me alone.

39:00.463 --> 39:03.507
Priscilla Caposky in the sixth grade
to Grace Gardner,

39:03.591 --> 39:08.054
my entire life has been determined
by my irresistibility

39:08.137 --> 39:09.722
to the female gender.

39:10.514 --> 39:11.349
It's a curse.

39:12.975 --> 39:16.437
Not to mention what it's doing
to my lower back.

39:17.605 --> 39:18.439
Phil.

39:19.732 --> 39:21.233
Could you raise Ray for me, please?

39:21.317 --> 39:23.486
Oh, will you excuse me, Mac?

39:23.569 --> 39:25.196
Look, you're busy.
I'll call you later about the game.

39:25.279 --> 39:26.655
Cheer up a little, will you?

39:26.739 --> 39:27.740
BELKER: Captain.

39:29.158 --> 39:30.201
Sit down.

39:33.037 --> 39:34.747
Captain, I don't know
what to do with this monkey.

39:34.830 --> 39:38.459
I called every agency in town
from the SPCA to Greenpeace.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.504
I guess maybe you'll have to put him
in Holding for the night.

39:42.004 --> 39:45.132
With those animals?
Come on, Captain, have a heart.

39:45.925 --> 39:48.135
Think we've got
a very sensitive creature here.

39:50.721 --> 39:52.264
How about the interrogation room?

39:53.516 --> 39:54.809
Thank you, Captain.

39:55.810 --> 39:57.937
Come on, hairbag,
you've got a room for the night.

39:58.020 --> 39:59.313
Great collar, Mick.

40:02.858 --> 40:05.361
So far, it's been zero, Frank.

40:05.653 --> 40:08.114
(woman on TV speaking Spanish)

40:10.032 --> 40:11.826
RAY: I'll stay. Hold on.

40:13.577 --> 40:15.204
Henry. Henry.

40:15.788 --> 40:18.249
Do you want to stay
or let the night shift have it?

40:23.421 --> 40:24.338
Yeah.

40:25.131 --> 40:27.842
Yeah, I'll stay, long as it takes.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.264
Henry will stay.

40:33.806 --> 40:35.015
I'll talk to the others.

40:35.099 --> 40:36.934
Okay, call me whichever way it goes.

40:37.017 --> 40:38.185
Will do.

40:38.727 --> 40:41.605
Frank, happy birthday.

40:42.648 --> 40:43.524
Thanks.

40:43.983 --> 40:45.609
(woman on TV continues talking)

41:04.128 --> 41:05.796
(door closes)

41:11.594 --> 41:12.928
Excuse me.

41:17.933 --> 41:21.479
(man and woman arguing in Spanish)

41:34.742 --> 41:36.410
(grunts)

41:39.788 --> 41:42.791
This is a lot like the place I grew up in
over on 110th Street.

41:42.875 --> 41:44.960
(siren wailing in distance)

41:46.212 --> 41:47.755
Same sounds, too.

41:49.632 --> 41:50.925
Pots and pans...

41:52.301 --> 41:53.677
20 different radios...

41:54.637 --> 41:56.388
married people screaming at each other.

42:01.685 --> 42:03.437
Might help if you talked about it, son.

42:04.855 --> 42:07.816
I told the cops. I don't know nothing.

42:08.943 --> 42:11.779
-I think you do.
-It don't matter what you think.

42:16.492 --> 42:17.785
(groans)

42:17.868 --> 42:21.080
Young man, I've been watching you,

42:21.163 --> 42:23.249
and we simply do not have
the time to fool around with this.

42:23.332 --> 42:25.292
-You know where he is, don't you?
-No.

42:25.376 --> 42:29.880
If he's out there, seven years old, alone,
Luis, he could die.

42:29.964 --> 42:31.757
You ever see someone
who's suffocated in a refrigerator?

42:31.840 --> 42:33.008
He turns blue, Luis.

42:33.926 --> 42:35.302
You've seen what rats can do

42:35.386 --> 42:38.097
to a wino who falls asleep
in the wrong alley? Do ya?

42:38.180 --> 42:39.348
Let me go!

42:39.431 --> 42:41.976
You listen to it
because this is the way it is.

42:42.059 --> 42:43.769
I'm going to run you
in for a lie detector test,

42:43.852 --> 42:45.187
and God help you if you're lying to me

42:45.271 --> 42:48.274
because right now the charge
is only child endangering,

42:48.357 --> 42:50.401
but if he dies, it's murder, Luis.

42:50.484 --> 42:51.944
And I don't give a damn how young you are.

42:52.027 --> 42:54.113
I swear to it, I'll see you do hard time.

42:54.196 --> 42:55.906
Now, what the hell did you do with him?

42:56.657 --> 42:59.076
Me and my friend Gilbert
made him think he killed me.

42:59.868 --> 43:02.788
We gave him a starter's gun,
and I put ketchup on my shirt.

43:03.831 --> 43:05.874
-Well--
-Where is he? Where is he?

43:19.221 --> 43:20.222
Michael?

43:21.098 --> 43:22.099
You in here, son?

43:32.192 --> 43:34.320
Everything's okay, son.
I've come to take you home.

43:35.529 --> 43:37.031
You don't have to hide anymore.

43:39.366 --> 43:40.701
You didn't kill anybody, son.

43:40.784 --> 43:43.287
(Michael sobbing)

43:43.370 --> 43:46.165
Come on, take a look for yourself.
Luis is right here next to me.

43:46.248 --> 43:47.291
(Michael whimpers)

43:56.550 --> 43:57.509
It's okay, son.

43:58.802 --> 44:00.804
Your brother was just playing
a game on you.

44:08.270 --> 44:09.271
Come on.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.409
Don't look so grim, Henry.

44:22.493 --> 44:23.869
That older kid needs help, Ray.

44:23.952 --> 44:26.205
I know. I explained that to her.

44:26.997 --> 44:28.957
Maybe you could stop by next week

44:29.041 --> 44:31.377
and have a talk with him,
take him to a ball game.

44:31.460 --> 44:33.629
He needs help, Ray, professional help!

44:33.712 --> 44:36.298
-She realizes that, Henry.
-So where is he going to get it?

44:36.382 --> 44:37.675
I mean, you saw that apartment.

44:37.758 --> 44:39.009
Damn refrigerator is almost empty.

44:39.093 --> 44:41.970
She'd have to clean house for a year
just to get his teeth fixed.

44:42.054 --> 44:43.514
I'll call County Health Bureau
in the morning.

44:43.597 --> 44:44.890
They don't take illegals.

44:45.766 --> 44:47.976
Then you tell me what the answer is!

45:08.997 --> 45:10.874
Happy birthday, pizza man.

45:16.046 --> 45:17.047
Well?

45:17.881 --> 45:20.926
-Do you like it?
-Oh, yeah, it's beautiful.

45:26.724 --> 45:27.725
What's wrong?

45:29.101 --> 45:30.853
Turning 40 got you down?

45:32.271 --> 45:35.232
Uh... I think so, yeah.

45:38.277 --> 45:41.155
I have the profound sense
I am not what I wanted to be.

45:42.197 --> 45:43.198
Which was?

45:44.366 --> 45:45.743
The next Stan Musial.

45:47.995 --> 45:50.372
You're a pretty heavy hitter
in my league, big guy.

45:50.831 --> 45:51.999
But not a starter.

45:52.374 --> 45:54.418
-Frank--
-I know. My timing stinks.

45:55.377 --> 45:57.296
For more reasons
than you could know, Joyce,

45:57.379 --> 45:59.006
you have been on my mind all day.

46:01.091 --> 46:02.050
I love you...

46:04.178 --> 46:05.512
and I'm looking for more than dinners

46:05.596 --> 46:07.723
in a neutral spot
where nobody will see us,

46:08.557 --> 46:11.810
a couple of sleepovers a week,
a lunch here and there if we're lucky,

46:12.102 --> 46:14.688
and two separate but equal lives,
your place or mine.

46:14.772 --> 46:16.523
What kind of relationship is that?

46:18.192 --> 46:19.777
My best one, actually.

46:19.860 --> 46:23.280
I am 40 years old today,
and I just spent an hour with my son.

46:23.363 --> 46:25.240
In a couple of days,
I'll get another hour.

46:25.699 --> 46:28.619
An hour with him, an hour with you.
Two hours here, three hours there.

46:28.702 --> 46:32.331
I have the feeling
that I just get bits and pieces

46:32.414 --> 46:34.208
of the people I love the most.

46:34.291 --> 46:36.877
My life is in fragments, and I want more.

46:38.045 --> 46:39.630
I can't give more yet.

46:40.798 --> 46:43.217
Well, one way or another,
I think you ought to decide.

46:44.343 --> 46:47.179
-Does it have to be this second?
-It's as good a time as any.

46:47.596 --> 46:49.139
Oh, Frank.

46:52.059 --> 46:53.060
Please.

46:54.102 --> 46:56.480
-Please don't do this.
-I have to.

46:58.607 --> 46:59.441
Why now?

47:00.108 --> 47:02.277
Because most of the time,
I want you so badly

47:02.361 --> 47:04.279
I'm willing to ignore my other needs,

47:04.863 --> 47:05.989
but not today.

47:08.200 --> 47:12.246
Today, I'm feeling
I want a wife and a home...

47:14.289 --> 47:17.459
and maybe even another kid,
and I want all that with you, counselor.

47:20.212 --> 47:21.505
At the very least,

47:21.588 --> 47:23.757
I want an open
and aboveboard relationship,

47:23.841 --> 47:25.551
no matter what the consequences.

47:29.930 --> 47:32.808
-Frank, you're backing me into a corner.
-Yes.

47:39.731 --> 47:41.316
Please don't bully me.

47:43.735 --> 47:44.778
Well, I--

47:46.822 --> 47:50.117
(stammers) I can't be stalled anymore.

47:50.742 --> 47:53.453
I mean, either we move forward
or it's over.

47:56.748 --> 47:58.041
(sighs)

48:32.492 --> 48:34.494
(closing theme playing)
