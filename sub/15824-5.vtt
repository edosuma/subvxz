WEBVTT

00:02.370 --> 00:03.671
MAJOR CRIMES.

00:03.704 --> 00:06.707
UH-HUH.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.442
UH-HUH.

00:08.476 --> 00:10.711
HEY, CHIEF?
YES?

00:10.744 --> 00:14.115
DR. MORALES SAYS THERE'S
A DEAD GUY AT A FUNERAL HOME.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.649
VERY FUNNY.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.785
SERIOUSLY, THERE'S A BODY
AT WEAVER FUNERAL HOME

00:17.818 --> 00:19.653
WITHOUT
A DEATH CERTIFICATE.

00:19.687 --> 00:22.256
WELL, ASK DR. MORALES TO SEND IN
A CORONER'S INVESTIGATOR.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.158
HE DID,
BUT THE DEAD GUY'S FAMILY

00:24.192 --> 00:26.160
DOESN'T WANT HIM
TO EXAMINE THE BODY.

00:26.194 --> 00:28.362
WHO DO YOU THINK
SHOULD HANDLE IT, CHIEF?

00:28.396 --> 00:31.565
UH, DETECTIVE JULIO SANCHEZ?
YOU HAVE BEEN SERVED.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.334
WHAT, AGAIN?

00:33.367 --> 00:35.236
Provenza: WELL,
IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING.

00:35.269 --> 00:38.572
NOT COUNTING MY 5 DIVORCES,
I'VE BEEN SUED 17 TIMES.

00:38.606 --> 00:41.342
LIEUTENANT
LOUIE M. PROVENZA?

00:41.375 --> 00:43.211
18.

00:43.244 --> 00:47.481
DEPUTY CHIEF
BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON?

00:47.515 --> 00:48.749
YOU'VE BEEN SERVED.

00:48.782 --> 00:51.685
WHAT'S GOING ON?
LIEUTENANT MICHAEL TAO?

00:51.719 --> 00:53.487
GETTING WALLPAPERED,
COMMANDER.

00:53.521 --> 00:55.656
FRANCIS B. WATSON?
WHAT?

00:55.689 --> 00:57.125
WHY ME?

00:57.158 --> 00:58.592
WHY "FRANCIS"?
THAT'S THE REAL QUESTION.

00:58.626 --> 01:00.461
LIEUTENANT ANDREW FLYNN?
YEAH, YEAH.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.132
Tao: A WRONGFUL-DEATH
CIVIL SUIT

01:04.165 --> 01:06.200
FILED ON BEHALF
OF TURELL BAYLOR?

01:06.234 --> 01:08.502
WE DIDN'T KILL THE GUY.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.671
YEAH, BUT HE WAS BEATEN
TO DEATH RIGHT AFTER WE
DROPPED HIM OFF AT HIS HOUSE.

01:10.704 --> 01:13.441
TURELL MURDERED AN OLD MAN
AND HIS 8-YEAR-OLD GRANDSON.

01:13.474 --> 01:14.708
WHO CARES
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

01:14.742 --> 01:17.111
COMMANDER RUSSELL TAYLOR?

01:20.148 --> 01:22.383
YOU HAVE BEEN SERVED.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.318
OKAY, THAT'S IT.

01:24.352 --> 01:26.854
WAIT. WHOA. WHOA.
WHAT ABOUT ME?

01:26.887 --> 01:28.289
SORRY.
THAT'S ALL I GOT.

01:34.228 --> 01:36.764
Flynn: YOU TALKED TO
THE BAYLORS' ATTORNEY ALREADY?

01:36.797 --> 01:38.366
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

01:38.399 --> 01:39.833
ARE YOU KIDDING?
ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?

01:39.867 --> 01:42.770
GABRIEL, IT'S FLYNN!
HE'S PARANOID FOR A LIVING.

01:42.803 --> 01:45.139
OF COURSE I'M PARANOID.
RAYDOR'S BEEN DOWN HERE
GRILLING US FOR WEEKS.

01:45.173 --> 01:47.341
LOOK, GENTLEMEN, WE'RE NOT
ALLOWED TO DISCUSS THE CASE,

01:47.375 --> 01:49.243
BUT WHAT
I CAN TELL YOU

01:49.277 --> 01:51.679
IS THAT THEY'RE ONLY
REALLY INTERESTED IN ME.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.147
FUNNY WAY TO SHOW IT.

01:54.182 --> 01:56.384
HEY. HEY, BUDDY.

01:56.417 --> 01:57.585
WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOING HERE?

01:57.618 --> 02:00.454
OH, I'M SERVING
SUBPOENAS TODAY,

02:00.488 --> 02:02.523
AND I'M ALSO THE ATTORNEY

02:02.556 --> 02:05.259
REPRESENTING THE MOTHER
OF TURELL BAYLOR...
YOU'RE THE WHAT?!

02:05.293 --> 02:07.395
...IN HER SUIT AGAINST THE CITY,
THE L.A.P.D.,

02:07.428 --> 02:08.929
AND ALMOST EVERYONE
IN THIS ROOM.

02:08.962 --> 02:11.332
MY NAME
IS PETER GOLDMAN.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.601
AND IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE
MEETING YOU ALL.

02:14.568 --> 02:17.605
UH, NOW THAT I HAVE
YOUR SQUAD ON RECORD

02:17.638 --> 02:19.740
SAYING TURELL BAYLOR
DESERVED TO DIE,

02:19.773 --> 02:21.909
I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD
ASK YOUR DETECTIVES

02:21.942 --> 02:23.611
A FEW SIMPLE
FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.513
NO! THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY
TO A CRIME SCENE

02:25.546 --> 02:27.881
OF A VERY SERIOUS MURDER
AT...

02:27.915 --> 02:30.351
WEAVER FUNERAL HOME.

02:31.585 --> 02:32.653
LIEUTENANT.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.955
RIGHT!
RIGHT! LET'S GO!

02:34.988 --> 02:39.193
HURRY UP.
GET OUT OF HERE. CLEAR OUT.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.964
IF YOU COULD SPARE ME
JUST A MOMENT --

02:43.997 --> 02:46.700
GOODBYE, MR. GOLDMAN.
I CAN'T HELP YOU. GOODBYE.

02:49.503 --> 02:52.873
I AM AN OFFICER OF THE COURT,
SWORN TO UPHOLD THE LAW,

02:52.906 --> 02:55.609
AND, JUST LIKE YOU, I AM ONLY
TRYING TO GET TO THE TRUTH.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.445
AND A $20 MILLION
SETTLEMENT.

02:57.478 --> 03:00.214
WHEN SUSPECTS DIE
WITHOUT DUE PROCESS,

03:00.248 --> 03:01.749
PEOPLE LOSE CONFIDENCE
IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.451
GOODBYE, MR. GOLDMAN.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.953
THERE WERE TWO OTHER COPS
IN THE CAR

03:05.986 --> 03:07.988
WHEN YOU DROVE
TURELL BAYLOR HOME.

03:08.021 --> 03:12.260
GIVE ME THEIR NAMES, AND I WON'T
DEPOSE YOUR WHOLE SQUAD.

03:12.293 --> 03:15.463
I'VE ALREADY HEARD
SOME OF YOUR PEOPLE

03:15.496 --> 03:17.465
WERE UNHAPPY WITH THE WAY
YOU TREATED TURELL.

03:17.498 --> 03:18.832
NICE TRY, MR. GOLDMAN.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.401
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
YOU COULD SAY

03:20.434 --> 03:21.769
THAT WOULD MAKE ME SUSPECT
MY FELLOW OFFICERS.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.438
JUST A FRIENDLY HEADS-UP.

03:24.472 --> 03:26.574
"GOODBYE" DIDN'T WORK.
LET'S TRY "GET OUT!"

03:26.607 --> 03:28.008
NOW.
COME ON. COME ON.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.710
LET ME WALK YOU BACK
TO THE ELEVATOR. LET'S GO.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.712
Goldman: IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I KNOW MY WAY AROUND.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.281
PLEASURE MEETING YOU.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.482
WALK.

03:34.515 --> 03:38.252
WHAT? I'M WALKING!
I'M WALKING.

03:54.435 --> 03:57.671
EXCUSE ME.
WAIT. WAIT, WAIT.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.006
I'M TERRY WEAVER.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.941
A-ARE YOU GENTLEMEN
ALL FROM THE POLICE?

04:00.974 --> 04:03.944
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA,
MAJOR CRIMES.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.379
MAJOR CRIMES?

04:05.413 --> 04:06.747
OH, MY GOSH.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.717
LISTEN, I'M THE FUNERAL DIRECTOR
HERE AND --

04:09.750 --> 04:11.385
SIX OF YOU?

04:11.419 --> 04:13.721
SIX -- OH, MY GOSH.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.523
THERE'S BEEN
A TERRIBLE MISCOMMUNICATION.

04:15.556 --> 04:18.859
DID SOMEONE CARRY A BODY IN HERE
WITHOUT A DEATH CERTIFICATE?

04:18.892 --> 04:21.995
OKAY, LISTEN.
CLIFF WYCOFF -- HE'S A MINISTER.

04:22.029 --> 04:25.633
PASTOR WYCOFF DIED
OF NATURAL CAUSES IN HIS HOME.

04:25.666 --> 04:28.602
AND HIS FAMILY BROUGHT HIM
TO THE FUNERAL HOME.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.471
HAVE YOU EXAMINED
THE BODY?

04:30.504 --> 04:31.905
OH, NO, NO.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.041
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT
BEFORE THE DEATH WAS CERTIFIED.

04:34.074 --> 04:36.510
THAT'S WHY
I CALLED THE CORONER.

04:36.544 --> 04:37.711
BUT WE DON'T NEED
THE POLICE.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.079
MR. WEAVER,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:39.112 --> 04:40.414
IS THE BODY IN THERE?

04:40.448 --> 04:41.682
FRONT OF THE CHAPEL,
YES.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.417
IN HERE.

04:43.451 --> 04:45.353
ALL RIGHT, L.A.P.D.
EVERYBODY BACK.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.555
STEP BACK.
STEP BACK.

04:47.588 --> 04:48.822
Chris:
WHY DOES HE HAVE -- NO, NO.
WHY DOES HE HAVE A CAMERA?

04:48.856 --> 04:50.324
NO, NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS WRONG.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.959
WHAT ARE YOU TAKING PICTURES
OF MY DAD FOR?

04:51.992 --> 04:53.761
CALM DOWN, SIR.
WE MEAN NO DISRESPECT.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.596
ARMY OR NAVY?

04:55.629 --> 04:57.598
I'M A LANCE CORPORAL,
UNITED STATES MARINES.
GREAT.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.500
'CAUSE IF YOU INTERFERE,
WE'LL CALL THE M.P.s

04:59.533 --> 05:01.569
AT CAMP PENDLETON,
AND YOU'LL BECOME THEIR PROBLEM.

05:01.602 --> 05:05.339
SO, SHOULD I PROCEED
WITH THE LIVER

05:05.373 --> 05:07.541
WELL, IF YOU CAN DO IT
BEFORE THEY START THE WAKE, YES.

05:11.812 --> 05:12.846
Man:
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

05:14.648 --> 05:17.551
NO VISIBLE HEAD TRAUMA.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.522
BUT I SEE PETECHIAE.

05:25.593 --> 05:26.927
AND LIGATURE
ON THE NECK.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.429
SO, STRANGULATION
OF SOME SORT.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.830
I'D CALL THAT UNNATURAL.

05:30.864 --> 05:34.535
91. THAT PUTS TIME OF DEATH
ABOUT TWO, THREE HOURS AGO.

05:34.568 --> 05:37.037
UM, GABRIEL,
COME WITH ME.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.573
UM, YOU THE WIFE?

05:39.607 --> 05:40.974
YES.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.943
YEAH, WELL, I NEED TO
TALK TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.912
THIS IS NO WAY TO TREAT
PEOPLE IN MOURNING.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.047
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT, LADY.
EXCUSE ME, LIEUTENANT.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.950
MRS. WYCOFF, YOU HAVE THE
L.A.P.D.'s DEEPEST SYMPATHIES

05:49.983 --> 05:51.752
IN THIS
VERY DIFFICULT TIME.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.455
PERHAPS THERE'S SOMEPLACE
WE COULD TALK IN PRIVATE?

05:54.488 --> 05:55.556
YES.

05:59.026 --> 06:02.129
Lieutenant, she may not realize
she did something wrong.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.632
She may also have
just strangled her husband.

06:04.665 --> 06:05.866
She's a preacher's wife.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.535
You have to approach her
a certain way.

06:07.568 --> 06:08.802
And you would know
how to do that

06:08.836 --> 06:10.538
better than I would
because?

06:10.571 --> 06:12.906
Because when I was a kid, I went
to church four times a week.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.942
Four times a week?

06:14.975 --> 06:17.411
Twice on Sunday, prayer
meetings on Wednesday,
choir practice on Friday.

06:17.445 --> 06:19.179
All right. All right.
You win.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.583
But hurry up. I'm not waiting
here till Jesus comes back.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.590
MRS. WYCOFF...

06:29.623 --> 06:32.693
I KNOW YOU'RE TAKING CARE
OF MANY PEOPLE RIGHT NOW,

06:32.726 --> 06:36.430
AND WE WILL BE SENSITIVE
TO YOUR SPIRITUAL OBLIGATION,

06:36.464 --> 06:38.566
BUT I ALSO NEED YOU
TO BE SENSITIVE

06:38.599 --> 06:40.133
TO YOUR LEGAL SITUATION.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.135
AND IT WOULD HELP US OUT GREATLY
IF YOU COULD JUST TELL US

06:42.169 --> 06:43.771
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR HUSBAND TODAY.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.075
CLIFFORD WAS, UM,
BATTLING DEPRESSION.

06:48.108 --> 06:53.080
HIS FAITH WAS STRONG,
BUT IT...

06:53.113 --> 06:55.683
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO KNOW
WHAT GOD WANTS.

06:55.716 --> 06:58.652
GOD DIDN'T WANT THIS.

07:00.521 --> 07:05.225
MY HUSBAND HUNG HIMSELF
IN THE GARAGE AT OUR HOUSE.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.996
I AM SO VERY SORRY.

07:09.029 --> 07:12.466
I KNOW HOW HARD
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN TO SAY.

07:13.701 --> 07:15.603
BUT, UM...

07:15.636 --> 07:18.772
CAN YOU TELL ME WHY YOU DIDN'T
CONTACT THE AUTHORITIES?

07:18.806 --> 07:20.474
I SHOULD HAVE, I KNOW,

07:20.508 --> 07:22.510
BUT I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE
IN THE CHURCH TO KNOW.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.046
OKAY.

07:26.079 --> 07:29.517
WE CAN CERTIFY
YOUR HUSBAND'S DEATH.

07:29.550 --> 07:30.918
BUT I NEED
WRITTEN CONSENT

07:30.951 --> 07:33.086
TO SEARCH YOUR HOME
AND YOUR GARAGE.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.888
OKAY?
THANK YOU.

07:39.927 --> 07:42.229
HERE.
LET YOURSELVES IN.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.798
I'M TAKING THE FAMILY TO CHURCH
IF YOU NEED ME.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.233
OF COURSE.
THANK YOU.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.574
THANK YOU.

07:57.778 --> 08:00.848
I JUST CAME UP WITH THE
PASTOR'S MOST RECENT
CREDIT-CARD CHARGE.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.016
UH, THIS GUY DIDN'T DIE
AT HOME, LIEUTENANT.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.052
STARLIGHT MOTOR LODGE.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.054
HE CHECKED IN
AT 10:00 A.M. THIS MORNING,

08:07.087 --> 08:08.789
AND HE STILL HASN'T
CHECKED OUT.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.059
YEAH, WELL, THAT DEPENDS
ON YOUR POINT OF VIEW.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.728
ALSO, SOMEONE MADE A CALL
FROM THE MINISTER'S ROOM

08:14.762 --> 08:16.797
AT THE STARLIGHT
AROUND 11:02 A.M.,

08:16.830 --> 08:19.767
WHICH WOULD BE JUST BEFORE
THE TIME OF DEATH.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.902
WELL, FIND OUT WHO
THAT CALL WENT TO, MIKE.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.070
MM.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.905
YEAH, CHIEF?

08:24.938 --> 08:28.041
UM, WE'VE GOT A SITUATION.

08:28.075 --> 08:30.110
MANAGER SAID THE VICTIM
WAS A REGULAR, CHIEF.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.779
HELD THE ROOM
WITH A CREDIT CARD

08:31.812 --> 08:33.614
AND THEN PAID WITH CASH
WHEN HE LEFT.

08:33.647 --> 08:36.083
OH, THE OLD
CHEATER'S TRICK.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.885
SO I HEAR.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.554
MAYBE HE JUST NEEDED
A QUIET PLACE TO REFLECT.

08:40.588 --> 08:41.889
BY THE HOUR?

08:41.922 --> 08:44.558
Man: GET IT ALL.
MAKE SURE IT GETS ALL CLEAN.

08:44.592 --> 08:45.759
HEY, GUYS, HOLD UP.
HOLD UP. Shh.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.160
Woman:
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

08:47.194 --> 08:49.563
MAKE SURE IT GETS
ALL CLEANED UP.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.302
STAY BACK, BUZZ.

08:55.335 --> 08:58.171
I SAID MAKE SURE
YOU EMPTY THE TRASH.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.907
SIR, L.A.P.D.!

08:59.940 --> 09:01.642
DROP IT.
DROP THE WEAPON.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.811
DROP THE WEAPON!
DEAR GOD!
DON'T SHOOT! DON'T SHOOT!

09:03.844 --> 09:05.145
Provenza:
WHAT THE HELL?!

09:05.178 --> 09:06.313
DON'T SHOOT!

09:07.114 --> 09:10.117
WE WERE
JUST CLEANING UP.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.853
MA'AM, PUT THE SPRAY
CLEANER DOWN AND STEP
AWAY FROM THE SINK.

09:19.092 --> 09:22.095
IT'S A HOT-GLUE GUN,
CHIEF.
A GLUE GUN?

09:22.129 --> 09:24.264
I JUST FIXED THAT LAMP,
AND NOW LOOK AT IT.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.768
WELL, WE HAVE A PAIR
OF MEN'S PANTS HERE,

09:27.801 --> 09:31.204
A, UH, SHIRT, BELT.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.808
AHA.
AND WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

09:36.276 --> 09:39.179
NOW, WHO DOES THIS
BELONG TO?

09:41.248 --> 09:44.151
Y'ALL WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO KNOW
A PASTOR CLIFF WYCOFF,

09:44.184 --> 09:45.686
WOULD YOU?

09:47.120 --> 09:49.790
HE WAS OUR SON-IN-LAW.

09:55.162 --> 09:58.131
I'M GONNA LET YOU IN
ON A LITTLE SECRET...

09:58.165 --> 09:59.633
ONLY MY WIFE KNOWS.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.269
Your pastor's not perfect.

10:05.372 --> 10:08.976
JESUS KNOWS THAT I'M A SINNER!

10:09.009 --> 10:13.714
HE LOVES ME IN SPITE
OF THE FACT THAT I'M HUMAN!

10:13.747 --> 10:14.915
PAUSE IT, BUZZ.

10:17.217 --> 10:20.320
WHAT KIND OF A WOMAN
ASKS HER PARENTS

10:20.353 --> 10:22.790
TO CLEAN UP THE MOTEL ROOM WHERE
HER HUSBAND WAS HAVING SEX?

10:22.823 --> 10:24.858
TAO.

10:24.892 --> 10:27.961
LOOKS LIKE THE PASTOR'S
LADY FRIEND LEFT IN A HURRY.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.063
ANYTHING FROM THE MOTEL
SECURITY CAMERAS?

10:30.097 --> 10:31.932
STRICTLY DECORATION,
CHIEF.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.334
SOMEBODY FOR SURE CALLED
HIS WIFE'S CELLPHONE
FROM THE MOTEL ROOM.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.704
CHIEF, FLYNN AND GABRIEL
PICKED UP MRS. WYCOFF

10:36.737 --> 10:38.105
AND HER FAMILY
AT THEIR CHURCH --

10:38.138 --> 10:39.707
CHIEF JOHNSON?

10:39.740 --> 10:41.975
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY
BACK HERE,

10:42.009 --> 10:44.211
BUT, UH,
THERE'S A BIT OF AN ISSUE.

10:44.244 --> 10:47.380
OKAY.
EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.082
I WANT TO KNOW
THE MOMENT

10:49.116 --> 10:51.284
THAT THE REST OF THE
WYCOFF FAMILY ARRIVES, PLEASE.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.053
THANK YOU.

10:55.055 --> 10:59.426
SO, WHY WERE YOU TALKING
TO PETER GOLDMAN THIS MORNING?

10:59.459 --> 11:03.463
UH, GOLDMAN PRETENDED
TO BE A PROCESS SERVER,

11:03.496 --> 11:06.466
AND HE THREW SUBPOENAS ALL
AROUND THE MURDER ROOM,
AND I ORDERED HIM OUT.

11:06.499 --> 11:10.003
I WASN'T TALKING TO HIM.
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND HE WAS
TRYING TO OFFER YOU A DEAL.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.171
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

11:12.072 --> 11:13.874
UGH!
COMMANDER TAYLOR!

11:13.907 --> 11:17.010
WHEN, WHEN, WHEN ARE YOU
GOING TO GET HIM OUT
OF MY MURDER ROOM?

11:17.044 --> 11:18.846
I CAN'T BEAR IT.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.314
LOOK, WILL, I DON'T --
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER

11:21.348 --> 11:23.250
WHAT GOLDMAN
WAS TALKING ABOUT.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.185
WELL, ALLOW ME
TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.387
HE WAS ASKING
WHO WAS WITH YOU IN THE CAR

11:27.420 --> 11:30.057
WHEN YOU DROPPED OFF
TURELL BAYLOR AT HIS HOUSE.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.959
NOW, WHY WOULD HE
BE ASKING THAT?

11:31.992 --> 11:33.226
WAS SOMETHING SAID
IN THAT CAR

11:33.260 --> 11:35.028
THAT COULD GET US
IN EVEN MORE TROUBLE?

11:35.062 --> 11:39.032
NO. GOLDMAN SERVED EVERYONE
A SUBPOENA, EXCEPT FOR GABRIEL,

11:39.066 --> 11:41.301
TO TURN US AGAINST EACH OTHER
AND MAKE US ALL PARANOID.

11:41.334 --> 11:42.936
GABRIEL
DIDN'T GET SERVED?

11:42.970 --> 11:45.105
YOU THINK HE'S ALREADY
TALKED TO GOLDMAN?

11:45.138 --> 11:46.940
PARANOIA PART
SEEMS TO BE WORKING.

11:46.974 --> 11:49.943
LOOK, WILL,
THIS IS ALL ABOUT ME.

11:49.977 --> 11:52.079
NOT ALL ABOUT YOU.

11:52.112 --> 11:55.482
I GOT SUBPOENAED, TOO,
AND I'M IN THIS NOW
UP TO MY NECK.

11:55.515 --> 11:58.418
AS IS THE CITY, THE DEPARTMENT,
YOUR ENTIRE DIVISION.

11:58.451 --> 11:59.987
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:00.020 --> 12:01.822
THE NEXT TIME GOLDMAN
COMES INTO YOUR MURDER ROOM,

12:01.855 --> 12:03.490
WILL YOU JUST GO INTO
YOUR OFFICE AND LOCK THE DOOR

12:03.523 --> 12:05.258
AND CALL
THE CITY ATTORNEY?

12:05.292 --> 12:07.060
WHICH IS WHAT YOU SHOULD
HAVE DONE THIS MORNING.

12:07.094 --> 12:09.863
OR, BETTER YET, FIND YOURSELF
A PERSONAL ATTORNEY.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.265
MAYBE HE CAN MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW SERIOUS THIS HAS BECOME.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.867
BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE
IS GETTING THROUGH TO YOU.

12:13.901 --> 12:16.403
COME IN.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.138
DAVID GABRIEL.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.774
CHIEF.

12:20.808 --> 12:22.910
UH, CHIEF JOHNSON,

12:22.943 --> 12:24.845
I HAVE THE REST OF THE
WYCOFF FAMILY WAITING FOR YOU.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.480
THANK YOU, DAVID.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.791
CHIEF, I KNOW EVERYONE
THINKS IT'S WEIRD

12:37.825 --> 12:39.392
THAT I DIDN'T GET SERVED,
BUT I JUST WANT YOU TO
KNOW I WOULD NEVER --

12:39.426 --> 12:40.828
DAVID, LET'S STOP
WORRYING ABOUT GOSSIP

12:40.861 --> 12:42.295
AND START CONCENTRATING
ON THIS CASE.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.364
WHAT WERE THE WYCOFFS DOING
WHEN YOU FOUND THEM?

12:44.397 --> 12:47.234
UH, YEAH, WELL, WHEN WE
FINALLY CAUGHT UP WITH
THEM AT THE CHURCH,

12:47.267 --> 12:49.436
THEY WERE DRIVING THEIR MINIVAN
AROUND THE PARKING LOT,

12:49.469 --> 12:51.538
RUNNING OVER COMPUTERS.

12:55.909 --> 13:00.147
SO, THIS IS WHAT'S LEFT OF THE
CHURCH'S ENTIRE I.T. DIVISION.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.149
THIS IS WHAT'S LEFT
OF MY DESK.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.817
THERE'S PROBABLY
A RECORD IN THERE

13:03.851 --> 13:05.418
OF OUR VICTIM'S
LITTLE LOVE CONNECTION.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.320
WELL, THIS LOOKS LIKE
AN ORGANIZED HIT.

13:07.354 --> 13:08.588
BUT WHO DID
THE ORGANIZING?

13:08.621 --> 13:09.990
I'M READY TO THROW
THEM ALL IN JAIL.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.358
I WISH
IT WERE THAT EASY.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.194
WHAT -- HOW DID YOU
GET BACK IN THIS BUILDING?

13:14.227 --> 13:15.929
OH, I NEVER LEFT.

13:15.963 --> 13:19.199
AND I'M SORRY TO DISTURB
YOUR...INVESTIGATION HERE.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.034
JUST, UH,
WANTED TO DROP BACK BY,

13:21.068 --> 13:23.436
SEE IF YOU'D HAD A CHANCE TO
THINK OVER MY LITTLE PROPOSAL.

13:23.470 --> 13:26.339
I HAVE.
I PROPOSE YOU STAND STILL,

13:26.373 --> 13:27.841
LET LIEUTENANT TAO
TAKE YOUR PICTURE,

13:27.875 --> 13:29.242
AND TELL SECURITY
TO ARREST YOU

13:29.276 --> 13:31.111
IF YOU EVER COME BACK
IN THIS BUILDING AGAIN.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.612
OKAY. I'M GOING.
I'M GOING.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.848
GET --
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

13:34.882 --> 13:38.218
JUST...CALL ME IF YOU CHANGE
YOUR MIND ON THE DEAL.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.020
DETECTIVE GABRIEL...

13:40.053 --> 13:42.923
LOOKING SHARP.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.898
I-I-I HAVE NEVER,
EVER MET THAT MAN

13:50.931 --> 13:53.166
IN MY LIFE
BEFORE TODAY!

13:53.200 --> 13:54.567
WELL, HE SURE AS HELL
KNOWS YOU.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.536
HEY, HEY!
THAT'S ENOUGH.

13:56.569 --> 13:59.172
NOW, WE ALL KNOW DAVID.
WE'VE WORKED WITH HIM FOR YEARS.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.341
HE'S A GOOD GUY.
HE'S A GREAT COP.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.610
AND HE'S AS LOYAL
AS THEY COME.

14:03.643 --> 14:06.479
OR ELSE HE'S A SNITCH.
MAN, WHAT --

14:06.513 --> 14:08.949
AT ANY RATE, HE'S
THE ONLY ONE OF US WHO
HASN'T BEEN SUBPOENAED,

14:08.982 --> 14:11.051
SO HE MUST HAVE
DONE SOMETHING RIGHT.

14:11.084 --> 14:14.454
THANK YOU, LIEUTENANT PROVENZA,
FOR THAT MORALE BOOSTER.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.356
MEANWHILE, I'D LIKE TO TALK
TO MRS. WYCOFF.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.558
DETECTIVE GABRIEL?

14:20.427 --> 14:22.996
LET'S START
WITH HOW YOU KNEW

14:23.030 --> 14:24.397
WHERE TO FIND
YOUR HUSBAND'S BODY.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.303
HE, UM...

14:30.337 --> 14:34.174
HE CALLED ME FROM THAT
HORRIBLE MOTEL TO SAY GOODBYE.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.442
THE NUMBER SHOWED UP
ON MY CELLPHONE

14:35.475 --> 14:37.644
AS THE STARLIGHT
MOTOR LODGE.

14:37.677 --> 14:40.047
HE TOLD YOU HE WAS
GOING TO KILL HIMSELF?

14:40.080 --> 14:43.616
I BEGGED HIM NOT TO,
BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME.

14:43.650 --> 14:46.486
UH, AFTER HE HUNG UP
THE PHONE,

14:46.519 --> 14:49.489
I-I RUSHED OVER TO FIND HIM,
BUT...

14:49.522 --> 14:51.224
IT WAS TOO LATE.

14:51.258 --> 14:54.361
HE WAS HANGING
BY HIS BELT

14:54.394 --> 14:56.329
FROM THE SPRINKLER PIPE.

14:56.363 --> 15:02.002
HE FELT HE'D LET ME DOWN,
HIS CHURCH DOWN.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.670
HE LET GOD DOWN.

15:03.703 --> 15:08.008
WELL, YOU CERTAINLY
LETDOWN, MRS. WYCOFF,

15:08.041 --> 15:10.277
'CAUSE I ALLOWED YOU TO
SPEND SOME QUIET TIME
WITH YOUR FAMILY,

15:10.310 --> 15:12.145
AND YOU USED THAT TIME
TO DESTROY

15:12.179 --> 15:14.414
ALL YOUR HUSBAND'S COMPUTERS
FROM THE CHURCH.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.116
I DID THAT, YES.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.551
IT WAS ONLY TO PROTECT
THE MEMBERS OF OUR CONGREGATION.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.187
PROTECT THEM FROM WHAT?

15:20.220 --> 15:22.722
OUR MEMBERS TRUSTED MY HUSBAND
WITH THEIR SECRETS.

15:22.755 --> 15:26.326
THE LAW DOESN'T RECOGNIZE
THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF
PROTESTANT MINISTERS.

15:26.359 --> 15:27.427
GOD DOES.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.963
WE MAY NOT HAVE
LEGAL RIGHTS,

15:29.997 --> 15:31.498
BUT WE HAVE
SPIRITUAL ONES.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.633
THOSE RIGHTS DO NOT INCLUDE
HAVING YOUR PARENTS

15:33.666 --> 15:36.169
STERILIZE THE MOTEL ROOM
WHERE YOUR HUSBAND DIED.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.672
HERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT THEY
COULDN'T SWEEP UNDER THE RUG.

15:41.141 --> 15:45.378
ANY IDEA HOW THESE
CAME TO BE THERE?

15:45.412 --> 15:48.348
I ASSUME HE WAS
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

15:48.381 --> 15:51.418
SOMEONE HE KNEW?
OR A PROSTITUTE, MAYBE?

15:51.451 --> 15:54.221
PLEASE,
I'M BEGGING YOU --

15:54.254 --> 15:58.125
DO NOT SENSATIONALIZE
MY HUSBAND'S SUICIDE.

15:58.158 --> 16:01.061
I'M NOT SENSATIONALIZING
ANYTHING, MRS. WYCOFF.

16:01.094 --> 16:04.231
BUT I ABSOLUTELY
NEED TO FIND THIS WOMAN

16:04.264 --> 16:06.666
WHO WAS WITH YOUR HUSBAND
AT THAT MOTEL ROOM.

16:06.699 --> 16:09.436
SHE RAN AWAY WITHOUT HER SHOES
AND HER UNDERWEAR,

16:09.469 --> 16:10.703
AND THAT WORRIES ME.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.439
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

16:12.472 --> 16:16.076
OR SHOULD I BE CHECKING WITH
ANOTHER FUNERAL HOME SOMEWHERE?

16:16.109 --> 16:17.344
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.380
IT'S IN GOD'S HANDS...

16:20.413 --> 16:22.482
NOT MINE.

16:25.418 --> 16:28.188
Provenza:
BOY, OH, BOY!

16:28.221 --> 16:30.490
THEY'RE ALL SINGING
FROM THE SAME HYMNAL.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.459
ANYBODY SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THE GIRLFRIEND?

16:32.492 --> 16:35.195
NOBODY KNOWS NOTHING
ABOUT NOTHING BUT SUICIDE.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.530
MRS. WYCOFF'S
ORCHESTRATED THIS WHOLE THING.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.466
SHE'S PRACTICALLY DARING ME
TO ARREST HER.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.068
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I SAY LET HER GO.

16:41.101 --> 16:44.437
WHY? SO SHE CAN DESTROY
MORE EVIDENCE?

16:44.471 --> 16:46.139
NO. SHE DOESN'T THINK
WE'RE QUESTIONING HER.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.640
SHE THINKS WE'RE QUESTIONING
HER FAITH AND HER BELIEFS.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.342
THAT'S ONLY GONNA
MAKE HER STONEWALL.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.111
BUT IF WE BACK OFF,
WHO KNOWS?

16:51.144 --> 16:53.480
MAYBE SHE'LL TRY TO CONTACT
THE OTHER WOMAN ON HER OWN

16:53.513 --> 16:55.082
OR LEAD US TO HER BODY.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.084
IT'S EITHER THAT,
OR WE TRY THOSE RED SHOES

16:57.117 --> 16:58.651
ON ALL THE FAIR LADIES
OF THE LAND.

17:00.287 --> 17:02.255
EXCUSE ME, CHIEF.
DR. MORALES IS READY FOR YOU.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.091
OKAY. THANK YOU.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.625
UH, LIEUTENANT,
I WANT 24-HOUR SURVEILLANCE

17:05.658 --> 17:07.094
ON EVERY MEMBER
OF THAT FAMILY.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.328
CAN YOU ARRANGE IT,
PLEASE?

17:08.361 --> 17:10.130
OH, LOVE TO.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.798
THANK YOU.

17:11.831 --> 17:15.168
OH, AND, UH, DETECTIVE GABRIEL,
I NEED YOU WITH ME, PLEASE.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.578
SO, SIR, DID SHE
SAY ANYTHING TO YOU

17:25.612 --> 17:27.647
ABOUT WHAT
GOLDMAN'S PROPOSAL WAS?

17:27.680 --> 17:29.449
NO.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.518
BUT WHATEVER
THAT ASSHOLE SUGGESTED,

17:31.551 --> 17:33.786
SHE'S NOT LETTING GABRIEL
OUT OF HER SIGHT.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.593
IN MY OPINION, THE LIGATURE
WOUNDS ARE CONSISTENT

17:40.627 --> 17:42.629
WITH THE BELT
FOUND AT THE SCENE.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.297
SO HE DID HANG HIMSELF.

17:44.331 --> 17:45.832
ONLY IF HE WAS
SOMEHOW ABLE

17:45.865 --> 17:48.601
TO DESPERATELY SCRATCH
AT HIS THROAT FOR AIR,

17:48.635 --> 17:50.837
SEVERELY BRUISE HIS KNEE,

17:50.870 --> 17:53.140
AND, FINALLY, SPRAIN HIS ANKLE
IN THE PROCESS.

17:53.173 --> 17:56.109
THAT SWELLING HAD TO HAPPEN
BEFORE THE GUY DIED.

17:56.143 --> 17:57.544
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THERE WAS A STRUGGLE.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.312
I'M SAYING THAT,
AT SOME POINT,

17:59.346 --> 18:01.281
THE VICTIM FOUND HIMSELF
FLAILING ON THE FLOOR.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.350
SO, WHAT, THE BELT
WAS BEING PULLED ONE WAY...

18:03.383 --> 18:06.419
AND OUR VICTIM WAS TRYING
TO PULL IT ANOTHER, YES.

18:06.453 --> 18:09.256
DOCTOR, WHAT ARE THESE?

18:09.289 --> 18:10.757
OH, YES.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.392
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THOSE
WERE BROKEN BLOOD VESSELS,

18:12.425 --> 18:14.427
BUT WHEN I SWABBED THEM,

18:14.461 --> 18:16.829
IT APPEARED TO BE
SOME KIND OF RED DYE.

18:17.830 --> 18:21.334
OH, MY GOSH.

18:21.368 --> 18:22.569
OH, MY GOSH.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.915
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
WE FOUND CINDERELLA.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.151
YEAH, BUT WHO TURNED HIM
INTO A PUMPKIN?

18:42.589 --> 18:45.325
ARE YOU GOING TO WORK?

18:45.358 --> 18:47.694
MM. THAT WAS
DETECTIVE GABRIEL.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.363
HE'S FOLLOWING THE WIDOW WYCOFF
TO CHURCH THIS MORNING.

18:50.397 --> 18:51.798
AT 6:00 A.M.?

18:51.831 --> 18:53.466
THAT'S WHERE SHE
AND HER FAMILY GO --

18:53.500 --> 18:54.834
HOME AND CHURCH,
CHURCH AND HOME.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.903
THAT WOMAN --
SHE HONESTLY THINKS

18:56.936 --> 18:58.505
SHE'S SOMEHOW
ABOVE THE LAW,

18:58.538 --> 19:00.473
THAT THE JUSTICE SYSTEM
JUST DOESN'T APPLY TO HER.

19:00.507 --> 19:03.276
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
DID YOU EVER CONTACT

19:03.310 --> 19:06.813
THAT ATTORNEY CAPTAIN RAYDOR
SUGGESTED TO YOU?
NO.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.515
KITTY!

19:08.548 --> 19:11.818
I MEAN JOEL, JOEL, JOEL, JOEL,
OFF THE TABLE.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.520
I REALLY THINK
YOU NEED AN ATTORNEY.

19:13.553 --> 19:16.523
CAN'T THINK ABOUT THAT
RIGHT NOW.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.658
I NEED TO FIND SOMEONE
WHO WAS WITH A MINISTER

19:18.691 --> 19:20.460
WHO LIKED TO WEAR
WOMEN'S UNDERWEAR.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.928
OH.

19:21.961 --> 19:24.564
VICTORIA ISN'T THE ONLY ONE
WITH A SECRET.

19:26.933 --> 19:29.836
HOW DO YOU EVEN KNOW
THIS MINISTER WAS WITH ANYONE?

19:29.869 --> 19:32.972
SOMEONE KILLED HIM...
IN A SEEDY MOTEL ROOM.

19:33.005 --> 19:36.309
HIS WIFE -- HIS WIFE KNOWS
EXACTLY WHO HE WAS WITH,

19:36.343 --> 19:38.311
AND SHE WON'T TELL ME.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.813
SHE'S MORE WORRIED WE'LL
FIND OUT HER HUSBAND WAS
A TRANSVESTITE

19:40.847 --> 19:42.315
THAN SHE IS ABOUT
FINDING HIS KILLER.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.983
PEOPLE ARE WEIRD.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.353
SHE EVEN HAD HER PARENTS
SCRUB DOWN THE CRIME
SCENE WITH BLEACH.

19:46.386 --> 19:48.455
I MEAN, WHO DOES THAT?!

19:50.757 --> 19:52.425
Oh, my gosh!

19:52.459 --> 19:54.761
THEY WEREN'T JUST TRYING
TO WIPE AWAY FINGERPRINTS.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.729
THEY WERE TRYING
TO WASH AWAY THE SIN.

19:56.763 --> 20:00.267
THAT'S IT, ISN'T IT?

20:00.300 --> 20:01.501
THEY WERE SHAMED.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.271
JUST WAIT TILL I ASK
THE WIDOW WYCOFF

20:04.304 --> 20:06.473
TO HELP ME FIND THE PERSON
WHO WAS WEARING THAT SHOE.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.275
THOUGHT YOU ALREADY KNEW
IT WAS THE PASTOR'S.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.643
YEAH, BUT SHE DOESN'T KNOW
I KNOW THAT!

20:10.677 --> 20:13.846
WATCHING ME HUNT FOR WHOSE FOOT
FITS THE RUBY-RED SLIPPER

20:13.880 --> 20:17.216
MIGHT JUST MAKE HER REALIZE
SHE'S NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.754
I LOVE THESE HEART-TO-HEARTS
WE HAVE IN THE MORNING.

20:21.788 --> 20:24.691
ME TOO, HONEY.
ME TOO.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.796
George: WHEN I STEPPED DOWN
FROM THE PULPIT OF THIS CHURCH

20:29.829 --> 20:32.299
AND PASSED IT ON
TO MY SON-IN-LAW,

20:32.332 --> 20:36.269
I NEVER IMAGINED THE PAIN
OF A DAY LIKE TODAY.

20:36.303 --> 20:39.639
GOD USES SUFFERING
TO TEST US.

20:39.672 --> 20:44.444
EVEN IN A DEATH FROM DESPAIR,
GOD OFFERS US CHOICES,

20:44.477 --> 20:48.448
ASKING IF OUR FAITH
IS STRONGER THAN ONE LEADER,

20:48.481 --> 20:52.952
QUESTIONING WHETHER THIS CHURCH
IS ABOUT ONE MAN OR ONE GOD.

20:52.985 --> 20:57.490
SO, WHEN YOU ALL ARE REACHING
OUT TO OUR CONGREGATION,

20:57.524 --> 21:01.894
RESIST THE TEMPTATION
TO SOW GOSSIP...

21:01.928 --> 21:04.631
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT INTERRUPTING
A CONFIDENTIAL MEETING

21:04.664 --> 21:06.333
OF OUR STEWARDSHIP
COMMITTEE.

21:06.366 --> 21:07.700
I'VE THOUGHT
OF ANOTHER WAY

21:07.734 --> 21:10.002
TO FIND OUT WHO WAS WITH
YOUR HUSBAND WHEN HE DIED.

21:10.036 --> 21:12.004
DOES THIS LOOK FAMILIAR?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
PUT THAT AWAY.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.807
THIS SHOE PROBABLY BELONGS
TO THE WOMAN WITH WHOM
HE WAS SLEEPING.

21:14.841 --> 21:17.344
CHANCES ARE, SHE EITHER
WITNESSED OR CAUSED HIS DEATH.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.045
MY HUSBAND
COMMITTED SUICIDE.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.713
PASTOR WYCOFF'S DEATH
IS UNDETERMINED,

21:20.747 --> 21:22.882
AND WHILE IT REMAINS THAT WAY,
I INTEND TO TRY THIS SHOE

21:22.915 --> 21:24.651
ON EVERY FEMALE
IN YOUR CONGREGATION,

21:24.684 --> 21:26.653
AGES 18 TO 65,

21:26.686 --> 21:28.721
STARTING WITH THE PEOPLE
ON YOUR STEWARDSHIP COMMITTEE.

21:28.755 --> 21:30.457
YOU WOULDN'T DARE.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.826
NO! PLEASE, PLEASE.

21:33.860 --> 21:35.828
MOM,
WHAT'S SHE SAYING?

21:35.862 --> 21:38.898
PLEASE DO NOT GO INTO THIS
CHURCH TERRORIZING EVERYBODY.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.467
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK

21:40.500 --> 21:42.101
I COULD POSSIBLY KNOW
WHO THIS WOMAN WAS?

21:42.134 --> 21:43.603
YOU DESTROYED
ALL THE COMPUTERS

21:43.636 --> 21:45.004
YOUR HUSBAND USED
HERE AT THE CHURCH,

21:45.037 --> 21:47.740
WHICH GIVES US THE IDEA
HE EITHER MET A WOMAN ONLINE

21:47.774 --> 21:50.443
OR WAS MAINTAINING SOME
SORT OF RELATIONSHIP
WITH A WOMAN ONLINE.

21:50.477 --> 21:54.781
ALL RIGHT.
PLEASE PUT THAT AWAY.

21:56.949 --> 21:58.718
YES.

21:59.952 --> 22:02.955
MY HUSBAND WENT
ON THE INTERNET.

22:02.989 --> 22:05.091
HE WENT ON A SITE
WHERE HE FOUND SOME WOMAN

22:05.124 --> 22:10.663
NAMED SINDY SHOWERS,
SPELLED S-I-N-D-Y.

22:12.465 --> 22:15.067
THANK YOU. WE'LL CHECK THAT OUT
AND GET BACK TO YOU.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.969
OH, I'M SURE YOU WILL.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.442
CHIEF JOHNSON...

22:22.475 --> 22:24.877
DO YOU EVEN BELIEVE
IN GOD?

22:24.911 --> 22:27.914
TELL YOU WHAT I DO BELIEVE,
MRS. WYCOFF.

22:27.947 --> 22:30.016
"THOU SHALT NOT KILL."

22:33.786 --> 22:37.657
MA'AM, THAT SHOE WON'T FIT
ANYBODY AT THIS CHURCH.

22:37.690 --> 22:38.991
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

22:41.027 --> 22:45.031
WHEN MY MOM FOUND MY DAD,
SHE CALLED ME, AND...

22:45.064 --> 22:47.700
WHEN I GOT TO THE MOTEL,
HE WAS WEARING THAT.

22:48.935 --> 22:52.839
AND HE WAS DRESSED
IN WOMEN'S UNDERWEAR AND A BRA,

22:52.872 --> 22:54.774
AND I HELPED HER CHANGE HIM
INTO A SUIT.

22:54.807 --> 22:58.778
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN
THE LIGATURE MARKS ON HIS NECK.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.079
COME ON, CHRIS.

23:00.112 --> 23:01.714
WE'RE ONLY TRYING
TO DO RIGHT BY YOUR DAD.

23:03.550 --> 23:08.120
YOU'VE HEARD OF THE...
AUTOEROTIC THING PEOPLE DO?

23:08.154 --> 23:10.189
YEAH, CHOKING YOURSELF
WHILE YOU'RE...

23:10.222 --> 23:11.591
YEAH.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.059
YOUR FATHER DID THAT?

23:13.092 --> 23:16.763
MY DAD WAS ON THE FLOOR
WITH HIS BELT AROUND HIS THROAT.

23:16.796 --> 23:21.901
AND MY MOM ROLLED HIM OVER,
AND HIS HAND WAS, UH...

23:21.934 --> 23:23.436
IT WAS, UH...

23:28.608 --> 23:30.810
CAN YOU REALLY BLAME HER FOR
NOT WANTING TO TALK ABOUT IT?

23:32.845 --> 23:35.715
CHIEF, I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH DR. MORALES.

23:35.748 --> 23:38.885
HE SAYS THE AUTOEROTIC
ASPHYXIATION THING IS POSSIBLE,

23:38.918 --> 23:40.820
BUT HE WANTED TO KNOW
IF WE'D FOUND

23:40.853 --> 23:42.722
A RELEASE MECHANISM
AT THE MOTEL.

23:42.755 --> 23:43.923
NOT SURE EXACTLY
WHAT THAT IS.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.758
WE DIDN'T FIND ONE.

23:45.792 --> 23:48.595
WAIT --
WHAT DIDN'T WE FIND?

23:48.628 --> 23:51.030
TYPICALLY, CHIEF,
THE AUTOEROTIC GUY

23:51.063 --> 23:53.766
RIGS UP THE CHOKING DEVICE
WITH A QUICK RELEASE

23:53.800 --> 23:55.602
TO PREVENT
ACCIDENTAL HANGING.

23:55.635 --> 23:58.771
AND WYCOFF
ONLY HAD HIS BELT.

23:58.805 --> 24:01.474
NOT SURE HOW THAT EXPLAINS
THE SPRAINED ANKLE.

24:01.508 --> 24:03.643
WELL, IT'S AN AWFUL LOT
TO BE DOING IN HEELS.

24:04.777 --> 24:08.014
SINDY SHOWERS
IS IN INTERVIEW ROOM NUMBER 1.

24:08.047 --> 24:09.716
VICE TRACKED HER DOWN
TO A WEBSITE

24:09.749 --> 24:11.551
CALLED
"WHO'S YOUR MOMMY?"

24:11.584 --> 24:14.554
SHE DOESN'T WANT A LAWYER
IF WE PROMISE NOT TO ARREST HER

24:14.587 --> 24:16.656
FOR SOLICITATION
AND LEWD CONDUCT.

24:16.689 --> 24:19.559
THANK YOU, COMMANDER.

24:22.995 --> 24:26.999
DAVID, HERE'S HOW TO END
THIS WHOLE SUBPOENA NIGHTMARE.

24:27.033 --> 24:29.669
JUST CALL GOLDMAN
AND TELL HIM YOU WANT TO TALK.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.270
WOULDN'T THAT
MAKE ME LOOK BAD?

24:31.303 --> 24:33.072
HOW COULD YOU LOOK
ANY WORSE?

24:36.142 --> 24:38.878
Brenda: MS. SHOWERS, I'M DEPUTY
CHIEF BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.213
I JUST GOT A FEW QUESTIONS
FOR YOU REGARDING YOUR SAFETY.

24:41.247 --> 24:42.615
MY SAFETY?

24:42.649 --> 24:44.116
YES.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.152
WE'RE TRYING
TO FIND SOMEONE

24:46.185 --> 24:49.989
WHO MIGHT BE TARGETING...
WORKERS LIKE YOURSELF.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.658
OH.
THEN OKAY, I GUESS.

24:51.691 --> 24:55.161
DO YOU RECOGNIZE
THIS MAN?

24:55.194 --> 24:57.597
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

24:57.630 --> 24:59.632
IF YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT MY SAFETY,

24:59.666 --> 25:01.200
YOU'VE GOT
THE WRONG GUY.

25:01.233 --> 25:05.004
I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR YEARS,
SEE HIM ONCE EVERY MONTH OR SO.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.106
YESTERDAY,
AS A MATTER OF FACT.

25:07.139 --> 25:10.076
DID YOU KNOW HE'S
A MEMBER OF THE CLERGY?

25:10.109 --> 25:13.212
NO. BUT THAT EXPLAINS
A FEW THINGS.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.214
LIKE?

25:15.247 --> 25:16.816
LIKE EVERY TIME
WE FINISH,

25:16.849 --> 25:19.018
HE TRIES TO TALK ME OUT
OF EVER MEETING HIM AGAIN,

25:19.051 --> 25:22.121
AND HE ALWAYS WANTS US
TO PRAY FOR FORGIVENESS.

25:22.154 --> 25:25.257
I'M USED TO GETTING ON MY KNEES,
BUT NOT FOR THAT.

25:27.594 --> 25:30.663
ANY OTHER, UM,
UNUSUAL REQUESTS?

25:30.697 --> 25:33.332
YOU MEAN THE LINGERIE?
NOT THAT UNUSUAL.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.768
I MEAN, YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
WHAT SOME MEN TRY TO PULL.

25:35.802 --> 25:38.871
THIS ONE GUY, HE TAKES
ABOUT 30 TOASTED ALMONDS

25:38.905 --> 25:40.640
AND LINES THEM UP --

25:40.673 --> 25:42.909
OFF TOPIC.
OFF TOPIC.

25:42.942 --> 25:46.779
OKAY, LOOK, CLIFFY PAYS ME
$300 FOR THE HOUR,

25:46.813 --> 25:48.347
PLUS ANOTHER $100
FOR THE UNDERWEAR

25:48.380 --> 25:50.216
AND ANOTHER $100
FOR THE SHOES.

25:50.249 --> 25:52.785
SO CLIFFY LIKES
TO WEAR WOMEN'S CLOTHES.

25:52.819 --> 25:54.286
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SO DO I.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.823
BIG DEAL.
HE'S NOT DANGEROUS.

25:56.856 --> 25:58.958
I-I'VE ALWAYS FELT SAFE
WITH HIM.

25:58.991 --> 26:01.160
EVEN WHEN HE ASKS YOU TO CUT OFF
HIS AIR SUPPLY?

26:01.193 --> 26:02.929
WHEN HE WHAT?

26:02.962 --> 26:04.764
HAVE YOU
EVER HEARD OF AUTOEROTIC --

26:04.797 --> 26:06.833
THE CHOKING THING?

26:06.866 --> 26:09.602
GOOD GOD, NO.
NOT ON MY MENU.

26:09.636 --> 26:11.738
NO BLOOD, NO BRUISES,
NO BONDAGE.

26:11.771 --> 26:15.107
I'M TELLING YOU, WHATEVER
THIS IS, YOU GOT THE WRONG GUY.

26:15.141 --> 26:18.010
HE LIKES TO PLAY DRESS-UP.
IT MAKES HIM HAPPY.

26:18.044 --> 26:20.312
WAS HE HAPPY WHEN
YOU LEFT HIM YESTERDAY?

26:20.346 --> 26:22.014
WHY WOULDN'T HE BE?

26:22.949 --> 26:26.753
BECAUSE, SINDY, WE FOUND
CLIFF IN THAT MOTEL ROOM

26:26.786 --> 26:30.056
NOT LONG AFTER YOU LEFT,
AND HE WAS DEAD.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.024
WHAT? NO.

26:34.761 --> 26:37.063
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

26:37.096 --> 26:39.966
NOW --
NOW YOU'RE SCARING ME.

26:39.999 --> 26:42.702
THAT'S...AWFUL.

26:42.735 --> 26:44.671
DEAD HOW?

26:44.704 --> 26:46.338
WE'RE NOT SURE EXACTLY.

26:46.372 --> 26:48.841
HE MAY HAVE
COMMITTED SUICIDE.

26:48.875 --> 26:51.978
HE DIDN'T KILL HIMSELF.
I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT.

26:52.011 --> 26:55.414
CLIFF LOVED HIS FAMILY WAY
TOO MUCH TO LEAVE THEM BEHIND.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.049
YOU KNEW
HE WAS MARRIED?

26:57.083 --> 26:58.117
WELL, YEAH.

26:59.251 --> 27:01.153
CLIFF TOLD ME
THAT HIS WIFE

27:01.187 --> 27:03.389
WASN'T INTO HIS WHOLE
DRESS-UP THING AT ALL.

27:03.422 --> 27:07.093
SO SHE LET HIM HANDLE IT
BY HIRING ME.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.328
SO SHE KNEW ALL ALONG?

27:09.361 --> 27:10.229
YEAH.

27:11.698 --> 27:15.067
CLIFF SAID --
I-I THINK HER NAME IS KATE --

27:15.101 --> 27:18.170
THAT KATE THOUGHT
IT WAS A LITTLE TWISTED,

27:18.204 --> 27:19.939
BUT AS LONG AS
HE DIDN'T BRING

27:19.972 --> 27:21.974
HIS BRAS AND PANTIES
INTO THE HOUSE,

27:22.008 --> 27:24.243
SHE COULD IGNORE IT.

27:24.276 --> 27:26.345
HE -- HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE DIFFERENT

27:26.378 --> 27:27.980
FROM MY USUAL DATES,

27:28.014 --> 27:31.918
BUT HE DIDN'T DESERVE TO DIE
IN THAT MOTEL ROOM.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.291
HIS WIFE HIRED
A PROSTITUTE

27:39.325 --> 27:40.960
FOR HER
CROSS-DRESSING HUSBAND.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.294
AND NOT JUST
ONCE OR TWICE.

27:42.328 --> 27:44.263
WHICH MEANS SHE ALSO
PROBABLY KNEW --

27:44.296 --> 27:46.198
WHEN IT WAS
HIS TIME OF THE MONTH?

27:46.232 --> 27:48.367
UH, LOOK, CHIEF.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.037
IF SHE WAS AWARE OF WHAT WAS
GOING ON FOR A WHILE,

27:51.070 --> 27:53.272
THEN WHY WAS YESTERDAY
THE BREAKING POINT?

27:53.305 --> 27:55.775
AND WHY WOULD HE CALL HER
IN DESPAIR?

27:55.808 --> 27:58.344
GOOD QUESTION. BUT IT SHOWS UP
ON THE MOTEL PHONE RECORDS.

27:58.377 --> 28:01.213
PASTOR WYCOFF
CALLED HIS WIFE.

28:01.247 --> 28:03.015
OR DID HE?

28:03.049 --> 28:04.917
CHIEF?
YES.

28:04.951 --> 28:07.219
CHIEF?

28:07.253 --> 28:09.021
WHAT ARE WE GONNA SAY
IN THOSE DEPOSITIONS?

28:09.055 --> 28:10.790
JUST THE TRUTH,
I GUESS.

28:10.823 --> 28:12.391
THE TRUTH. YEAH.

28:12.424 --> 28:16.195
BUT FIRST, SHOULDN'T WE ALL
AGREE AS TO WHAT THAT IS?

28:16.228 --> 28:19.131
I DO PHONE TREES
ALL THE TIME,

28:19.165 --> 28:22.301
BUT VERY SELDOM DO WE GET TO
PUT TOGETHER AN ALL-OUT MATRIX.

28:22.334 --> 28:25.872
AND THIS IS EVERY PHONE CALL
BETWEEN EVERY FAMILY MEMBER?

28:25.905 --> 28:28.440
LAND LINES AND CELLS.

28:28.474 --> 28:30.910
EVERYBODY'S CALLING EVERYBODY
EXCEPT THE OLDEST SON.

28:30.943 --> 28:32.444
ISN'T IT FUNNY HOW,
IN EVERY FAMILY,

28:32.478 --> 28:34.446
THERE'S ALWAYS
AN ODD MAN OUT?

28:34.480 --> 28:36.315
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

28:36.348 --> 28:38.450
IT MEANS EVERYBODY KNOWS
THAT YOU'VE ALREADY

28:38.484 --> 28:40.052
SAID YOUR PIECE TO GOLDMAN,
AND THAT'S WHY HE WAS HERE.

28:40.086 --> 28:41.821
WAIT, WAIT.
WHO'S "EVERYBODY" --

28:41.854 --> 28:43.189
PROVENZA, TAO, AND BUZZ --
OR IS "EVERYBODY" JUST YOU?

28:43.222 --> 28:44.757
OH, YEAH, IT'S JUST ME.
I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT --

28:44.791 --> 28:46.893
GENTLEMEN,
PLEASE STOP THIS BICKERING!

28:46.926 --> 28:49.862
THIS RIDICULOUS LAWSUIT
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.898
IT'S ALL ABOUT ME.

28:52.899 --> 28:55.401
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,
DETECTIVE GABRIEL,

28:55.434 --> 28:58.370
LIEUTENANT FLYNN, I WANT
A PAIR OF SHINY HANDCUFFS
SLAPPED ON MRS. WYCOFF.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.840
MAKE SURE HER FAMILY KNOWS
SO THAT THEY'LL FOLLOW
HER DOWN HERE.

29:00.873 --> 29:02.775
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA,
LIEUTENANT TAO,

29:02.809 --> 29:04.877
LET'S GET THIS MURDER BOARD
OUT OF HERE.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.545
WHERE TO, CHIEF?
INTERVIEW ROOM 2.

29:06.578 --> 29:09.916
I DON'T WANT THE WYCOFFS
SEEING IT BEFORE WE'RE READY.

29:09.949 --> 29:11.918
Brenda:
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN YOUR
HUSBAND WAS A CROSS

29:11.951 --> 29:14.553
JUST...A FEW WEEKS.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.955
REALLY?

29:15.988 --> 29:17.957
BECAUSE SINDY WITH AN "S"
TOLD US

29:17.990 --> 29:19.792
THAT HE DRESSED UP FOR HER
ONCE A MONTH

29:19.826 --> 29:21.327
AND THAT IT WAS
ALL YOUR IDEA.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.395
I WON'T STAND FOR THIS.

29:23.429 --> 29:27.033
THIS IS AN ATTEMPT
TO DESTROY MY CHURCH.
HAVE A SEAT, SIR.

29:27.066 --> 29:29.235
YOU PRESUME, BECAUSE
I'M A CHRISTIAN, THAT
I SOMEHOW CLAIM TO BE --

29:29.268 --> 29:30.536
NO, NO, NO.

29:30.569 --> 29:32.839
I PRESUME
THAT YOU'RE NOT PROUD

29:32.872 --> 29:34.440
OF HELPING YOUR HUSBAND
COMMIT ADULTERY.

29:34.473 --> 29:36.242
JUDGE NOT
LEST YE BE JUDGED.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.344
I WON'T BE THE ONE DOING
THE JUDGING, MRS. WYCOFF.

29:41.213 --> 29:44.283
THERE IS MORE TO MARRIAGE
THAN FIDELITY.

29:46.018 --> 29:48.587
IT'S ABOUT
RAISING CHILDREN.

29:48.620 --> 29:51.557
IT'S ABOUT...

29:51.590 --> 29:53.259
UM...

29:55.061 --> 29:57.964
I DID MY BEST. I DID MY BEST.
I REALLY DID MY BEST.

29:57.997 --> 30:00.867
I'M SURE YOU DID, BUT WE
NEED TO TALK ABOUT SINDY.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.468
SHE SAID YOUR HUSBAND
WAS HAPPY

30:02.501 --> 30:05.104
WHEN SHE LEFT THE MOTEL ROOM
AT 10:55,

30:05.137 --> 30:08.074
SO WHY DID HE WANT TO DIE
AT 11:02?

30:08.107 --> 30:09.876
CLIFF WAS DISGUSTED
WITH HIMSELF.

30:11.377 --> 30:13.212
HE WOULD COME HOME
FROM THESE TERRIBLE SESSIONS

30:13.245 --> 30:15.314
AND CRY FOR FORGIVENESS.

30:15.347 --> 30:17.884
HE HUNG HIMSELF.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.485
WHY IS THAT SO HARD
FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND?

30:19.518 --> 30:22.388
BECAUSE IF HE WAS SO ASHAMED,
WHY DID HE KILL HIMSELF

30:22.421 --> 30:24.556
DRESSED LIKE THAT
FOR ALL WHOLE WORLD TO SEE?

30:27.526 --> 30:31.163
MRS. WYCOFF, THE CORONER
SAYS YOUR HUSBAND'S WOUNDS

30:31.197 --> 30:33.265
ARE CONSISTENT WITH MURDER
BY STRANGULATION.

30:33.299 --> 30:35.501
AND WE KNOW THAT SINDY --
I TOLD YOU, HE CALLED ME
FROM THE MOTEL.

30:35.534 --> 30:37.269
BUT HE DIDN'T.

30:37.303 --> 30:39.405
YOU KEEP LYING TO ME, AND I'M
GOING TO HAVE TO TELL THE MEDIA

30:39.438 --> 30:41.273
THAT YOUR HUSBAND DIED
WEARING PINK PANTIES, A BRA,

30:41.307 --> 30:42.975
AND A NEW PAIR OF PUMPS.

30:43.009 --> 30:45.544
SO, WHO CALLED YOU
FROM THE MOTEL?

30:51.250 --> 30:53.185
IF I TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED,

30:53.219 --> 30:54.520
CAN YOU KEEP
THE PROSTITUTION

30:54.553 --> 30:56.155
AND CROSS-DRESSING
TO YOURSELVES?

30:57.556 --> 30:59.959
WE CAN TRY.

30:59.992 --> 31:01.627
AND WILL YOU LEAVE
MY FAMILY OUT OF IT?

31:03.095 --> 31:05.331
BECAUSE, HONESTLY,
THIS IS ALL ABOUT ME.

31:05.364 --> 31:08.167
ALL ABOUT YOU?

31:10.569 --> 31:14.140
I CALLED MY OWN PHONE
TO ESTABLISH AN ALIBI.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.441
I KILLED HIM.

31:17.109 --> 31:18.544
I SNAPPED.

31:18.577 --> 31:21.280
GOD FORGIVE ME.

31:21.313 --> 31:23.449
I KILLED HIM.

31:25.985 --> 31:28.087
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT IS THIS?

31:28.120 --> 31:29.521
YOUR DAUGHTER
JUST CONFESSED, SIR.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.924
BUT YOU DON'T
BELIEVE HER!
I CERTAINLY DO.

31:31.958 --> 31:34.293
OH, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
KATE DIDN'T KILL HIM.

31:34.326 --> 31:35.995
LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED.
DADDY, BE QUIET.

31:36.028 --> 31:37.363
YOU CAN'T ARREST HER.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.365
ACTUALLY, I INTEND TO ARREST
YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY --

31:39.398 --> 31:40.632
THE WHOLE LYING LOT
OF YOU --

31:40.666 --> 31:42.501
AS ACCESSORIES TO MURDER
AFTER THE FACT.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.603
SO, NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO
STOP COVERING UP FOR EACH OTHER.

31:44.636 --> 31:46.973
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,
READ THEM THEIR RIGHTS, PLEASE,

31:47.006 --> 31:48.941
STARTING
WITH GEORGE HERE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THIS IS CRAZY.

31:48.975 --> 31:50.409
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT, SIR.

31:50.442 --> 31:51.710
WHAT DID WE DO?

31:51.743 --> 31:53.612
BESIDES OBSTRUCT JUSTICE
AND DESTROY EVIDENCE?

31:53.645 --> 31:55.347
LET ME SHOW YOU.

31:55.381 --> 31:56.949
...WILL BE APPOINTED FOR YOU
BY THE STATE.

31:56.983 --> 31:59.051
HAVE YOU HEARD
AND UNDERSTOOD THESE RIGHTS

31:59.085 --> 32:01.954
AS THEY HAVE BEEN
READ TO YOU, SIR?

32:01.988 --> 32:06.625
THIS IS A, UH, MATRIX --
OR A MAP, IF YOU WILL --

32:06.658 --> 32:08.694
OF ALL THE PHONE CALLS MADE

32:08.727 --> 32:12.231
AROUND THE TIME
OF YOUR FATHER'S DEATH.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.366
UM,
HERE IS YOUR MOTHER

32:14.400 --> 32:17.369
CALLING FROM THE MOTEL
TO HER OWN CELLPHONE

32:17.403 --> 32:19.738
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE SHE
WASN'T THERE -- VERY CLEVER.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.641
ABOUT 45 MINUTES LATER,
SHE CALLED YOUR GRANDPARENTS,

32:22.674 --> 32:26.078
WHO, IN TURN, CALLED
YOUR LITTLE SISTER AND BROTHER

32:26.112 --> 32:29.248
TO PICK UP YOUR FATHER'S CLOTHES
FROM HOME, I ASSUME.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.250
AND HERE'S THE CALL
INFORMING YOU

32:31.283 --> 32:33.285
THAT YOUR FATHER HAD --

32:34.386 --> 32:35.988
WAIT A MINUTE.

32:36.022 --> 32:38.457
LIEUTENANT TAO,
THIS IS CHRIS WYCOFF OVER HERE,

32:38.490 --> 32:41.160
AND YET LOOKS LIKE
NO ONE CALLED HIM.

32:41.193 --> 32:43.329
COULD THAT BE RIGHT?
YES, CHIEF.

32:43.362 --> 32:45.097
AND YET YOU WERE
AT THE MOTEL.

32:45.131 --> 32:47.666
HOW'D YOU EVEN KNOW
YOUR FATHER WAS DEAD?

32:47.699 --> 32:49.301
SKYWRITING?

32:49.335 --> 32:51.303
I WAS PULLING DUTY ON BASE
WHEN I GOT THE CALL.

32:51.337 --> 32:53.472
NO, YOU WEREN'T.
WE CHECKED WITH YOUR COMMANDER.

32:53.505 --> 32:55.574
YOU ASKED FOR YESTERDAY OFF
TWO WEEKS AGO.

32:55.607 --> 32:57.509
WHICH MAKES THIS LOOK A LOT
LIKE PREMEDITATION.

32:57.543 --> 32:59.211
WAIT.

32:59.245 --> 33:00.546
I'LL TELL YOU WHY
I DIDN'T GET THE CALL.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.449
MA'AM,
CAN WE TALK PRIVATELY?

33:03.482 --> 33:05.317
LIEUTENANT.

33:09.655 --> 33:11.757
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO,
MY DAD ASKED ME

33:11.790 --> 33:14.093
TO LOOK AT HIS COMPUTER
AT CHURCH.

33:14.126 --> 33:16.195
HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE
WITH THE WI-FI.

33:16.228 --> 33:18.664
AND I FOUND A HIDDEN E-MAIL
ACCOUNT WHERE THIS WOMAN --

33:18.697 --> 33:21.133
THIS PROSTITUTE --

33:21.167 --> 33:23.169
WAS WRITING TO HIM
ABOUT THEIR NEXT MEETING.

33:24.303 --> 33:27.573
I HAD TROUBLE BELIEVING IT,
SO I FOLLOWED HIM.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.475
I WANTED
TO CONFRONT HIM.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.177
SO, YOU WATCHED HIM
CHECK INTO THE MOTEL,

33:31.210 --> 33:33.312
AND YOU SAW THE PROSTITUTE
COME AND GO?

33:33.345 --> 33:35.647
EXACTLY,
AND AFTER SHE LEFT,

33:35.681 --> 33:38.317
I OPENED THE DOOR, AND MY DAD
WAS LYING DEAD ON THE FLOOR
FROM THE AUTOEROTIC --

33:38.350 --> 33:41.120
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. THERE WAS
NO AUTOEROTIC ANYTHING.

33:41.153 --> 33:43.722
WELL, IT SURE AS HECK
LOOKED LIKE IT.

33:43.755 --> 33:45.524
I DON'T KNOW.

33:45.557 --> 33:47.359
M-MAYBE THE PROSTITUTE
KILLED HIM. I D-- I DON'T KNOW.

33:47.393 --> 33:50.262
HE WAS PAYING HER $500 AN HOUR.
WHY WOULD SHE KILL HIM?

33:51.663 --> 33:53.532
LOOK, YOUR MOTHER JUST
CONFESSED TO THIS MURDER.

33:53.565 --> 33:55.201
I COULD TAKE HER WORD FOR IT,
CORPORAL.

33:55.234 --> 33:56.702
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

33:56.735 --> 33:59.305
LET YOUR BROTHER AND SISTER
GROW UP WITHOUT BOTH PARENTS?

33:59.338 --> 34:01.607
MAYBE THEY'D
BE BETTER OFF.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.075
YOUR FATHER LED
A DOUBLE LIFE,

34:03.109 --> 34:04.676
BUT YOUR MOM'S THE ONE
WHO MADE IT POSSIBLE.

34:04.710 --> 34:07.579
LYING.
COVERING UP FOR HIM.

34:07.613 --> 34:09.481
MAYBE SHE DESERVES
TO GO TO PRISON.

34:09.515 --> 34:10.782
HMM?

34:11.583 --> 34:15.121
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING?

34:17.589 --> 34:19.658
IN OUR HOUSE,
WE WERE TAUGHT,

34:19.691 --> 34:23.462
"HONOR THY FATHER
AND THY MOTHER."

34:23.495 --> 34:25.731
IF YOU SO MUCH AS BREATHED
WRONG, YOU GOT THE BELT.

34:25.764 --> 34:28.634
DID YOU EVER
BREATHE WRONG?

34:34.606 --> 34:37.376
WHEN I WAS 15,
MY -- MY DAD,

34:37.409 --> 34:41.680
THE MAN WHO TAUGHT ME
RIGHT FROM WRONG,

34:41.713 --> 34:45.184
THE GUY WHO LIKED TO WEAR
WOMEN'S LINGERIE...

34:45.217 --> 34:50.156
HE FOUND A NOTE FROM THIS BOY
THAT I KNEW IN CHOIR --

34:50.189 --> 34:51.590
JEFF.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.259
THE TWO OF US WERE,
UH...

34:53.292 --> 34:56.762
JEFF AND I WERE CLOSE.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.297
WE WERE CLOSE.

34:58.330 --> 35:00.866
AND I SAVED THAT NOTE
IN MY ROOM

35:00.899 --> 35:03.569
AT THE VERY BACK
OF MY DESK DRAWER.

35:03.602 --> 35:06.438
IT WAS NONE
OF MY DAD'S BUSINESS...

35:06.472 --> 35:08.840
THAT NOTE.

35:10.876 --> 35:13.779
BUT HE FOUND IT.

35:13.812 --> 35:15.381
AND HE WENT CRAZY.

35:15.414 --> 35:17.749
WENT CRAZY HOW?

35:21.687 --> 35:23.155
FIRST HE BEAT ME.

35:23.189 --> 35:25.891
THE HE SHIPPED ME OFF
TO MILITARY SCHOOL.

35:27.593 --> 35:29.261
AND WHEN I CAME HOME
FOR CHRISTMAS,

35:29.295 --> 35:30.896
I-I FOUND OUT THAT MY DAD
HAD BROUGHT THAT NOTE

35:30.929 --> 35:32.798
OVER TO JEFF'S HOUSE
AND SHOWED IT TO HIS PARENTS

35:32.831 --> 35:36.835
AND THAT...

35:36.868 --> 35:40.872
MY FRIEND...

35:40.906 --> 35:43.509
HE'D KILLED HIMSELF.

35:43.542 --> 35:48.647
OH, AND GUESS WHO PREACHED
AT JEFF'S FUNERAL.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.417
SO WHEN MY DAD
OPENED THAT DOOR YESTERDAY,

35:51.450 --> 35:54.820
LOOKING LIKE
SOME KIND OF FREAK...

35:54.853 --> 35:57.656
AND HE STARTED SAYING THAT IT
WAS ONLY THIS ONCE AND THAT --

35:57.689 --> 35:59.458
THAT WE SHOULD
JUST PRAY ABOUT IT,

35:59.491 --> 36:00.892
AND AT LEAST
HE WASN'T GAY.

36:00.926 --> 36:03.962
YOU SAW HIS BELT.
IS THAT IT?

36:03.995 --> 36:06.832
YOU GRABBED HIS BELT?

36:06.865 --> 36:09.401
YEAH,
I GRABBED HIS BELT.

36:09.435 --> 36:10.902
AND WHAT DID YOU DO?

36:14.940 --> 36:16.975
IT'S TIME TO DO
THE HONORABLE THING, CORPORAL.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.411
I PUT IT
AROUND HIS NECK,

36:19.445 --> 36:21.380
AND I YANKED HIM
ALL OVER THE ROOM.

36:21.413 --> 36:22.781
AND THEN?

36:25.884 --> 36:27.753
MA'AM, I SPENT FIVE YEARS
IN AFGHANISTAN.

36:27.786 --> 36:29.388
I KNOW
WHEN SOMEONE'S DEAD.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.828
I KILLED HIM.

36:36.862 --> 36:39.465
AND THEN I CALLED
MY MOTHER.

36:39.498 --> 36:40.899
AND I LEFT HIM
IN HIS LITTLE OUTFIT,

36:40.932 --> 36:43.502
THINKING, "WELL...

36:43.535 --> 36:45.471
NOW SHE'LL FINALLY
SEE THE TRUTH."

36:47.473 --> 36:50.376
BUT SHE ALREADY KNEW.

36:50.409 --> 36:53.279
AND I REALIZED,
WHILE SHE WAS FUSSING WITH HIM,

36:53.312 --> 36:57.015
YOU KNOW, TAKING OFF HIS BRA,
ASKING ME TO HELP KNOT HIS TIE,

36:57.048 --> 36:59.685
THAT SHE HAD NEVER ONCE
IN ALL OF MY LIFE

36:59.718 --> 37:01.353
STOOD UP
FOR ANYONE BUT HIM.

37:03.989 --> 37:08.560
AND FOR A MOMENT THERE --
FOR A REALLY BAD MOMENT --

37:08.594 --> 37:10.862
I THOUGHT ABOUT
KILLING HER, TOO.

37:24.743 --> 37:28.480
MA'AM...I'M SORRY TO HAVE LIED
TO YOU ABOUT EVERYTHING.

37:28.514 --> 37:29.915
IT WAS NOT
THE HONORABLE THING TO DO,

37:29.948 --> 37:31.483
AND I WISH TO APOLOGIZE

37:31.517 --> 37:33.051
FOR HAVING CAUSED EVERYONE
SO MUCH TROUBLE.

37:33.084 --> 37:36.522
WELL...

37:36.555 --> 37:39.891
I DON'T DEAL MUCH
IN FORGIVENESS, CORPORAL.

37:42.394 --> 37:44.330
BUT I SURE AM SORRY
TO HAVE TO ARREST YOU

37:44.363 --> 37:45.764
FOR MURDER
IN THE FIRST DEGREE.

37:55.006 --> 37:56.975
HEY, EVERYONE.
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

37:58.377 --> 38:00.379
I HAVE TO CONGRATULATE
YOU GUYS

38:00.412 --> 38:03.449
ON BEING A PRETTY TIGHT
LITTLE UNIT.

38:04.550 --> 38:07.319
DETECTIVE
DAVID GABRIEL...

38:07.353 --> 38:09.888
YOU HAVE BEEN SERVED.

38:10.989 --> 38:13.925
HAPPY NOW?
IT'S WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.427
ECSTATIC. THANK YOU.

38:15.461 --> 38:16.695
NOW YOU KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE

38:16.728 --> 38:17.863
TO BE SINGLED OUT
BY YOUR OWN GANG.

38:18.697 --> 38:22.033
BUT SERIOUSLY,
DON'T THANK ME.

38:22.067 --> 38:23.802
THANK CHIEF JOHNSON.

38:25.804 --> 38:29.475
SHE'S THE ONE WHO PUT YOU ALL
IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

38:33.111 --> 38:34.846
ASKED TO BE SUBPOENAED?

38:34.880 --> 38:37.015
IT'S ONLY FAIR, RIGHT?

38:37.048 --> 38:40.051
SO, COME ON. GIVE IT UP.
SHOW ME SOME LOVE.

38:40.085 --> 38:41.453
I'M SUBPOENAED, TOO.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.722
WELCOME TO THE CLUB.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.357
Provenza: NO RATS.
NO RATS HERE.

38:45.391 --> 38:46.925
NO RATS.
OH, THANK YOU,
LIEUTENANT.

38:46.958 --> 38:48.760
I COULD HAVE TOLD
YOU THAT, THOUGH.

38:57.703 --> 38:59.805
HERE WE GO!
HERE WE GO!

38:59.838 --> 39:01.473
ALL RIGHT.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.112
HEY.

39:41.146 --> 39:43.649
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

39:45.617 --> 39:47.118
ROUGH DAY?

39:47.152 --> 39:48.887
SORT OF.

39:48.920 --> 39:53.124
BAYLORS' ATTORNEY CAME BACK AND
SUBPOENAED DETECTIVE GABRIEL,

39:53.158 --> 39:56.495
SO THAT OFFICIALLY PUTS
MY ENTIRE DIVISION IN HOT WATER.

39:56.528 --> 39:57.929
AH.

39:57.963 --> 40:02.100
OVER A DECISION MADE BY ME
AND ME ALONE.

40:04.470 --> 40:08.474
WHAT I'M WONDERING ABOUT
NOW IS,

40:08.507 --> 40:10.642
HOW MUCH WORSE
ARE THINGS GOING TO GET?

40:10.676 --> 40:13.512
I MEAN...
REALLY, HOW MUCH WORSE?

40:13.545 --> 40:15.814
A LITTLE WORSE, MAYBE.

40:20.552 --> 40:22.153
WHAT?

40:22.187 --> 40:24.055
YOU TOO

40:24.089 --> 40:27.092
REMEMBER WHEN TURELL
FIRST PRESENTED HIMSELF,

40:27.125 --> 40:28.860
I VOLUNTEERED TO PROVIDE
PROTECTIVE CUSTODY

40:28.894 --> 40:30.462
FOR HIS MOM AND SISTER.

40:30.496 --> 40:31.730
REMEMBER?
HONEY, I'M SORRY.

40:31.763 --> 40:35.166
I'M -- I'M SO SORRY.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.602
WHY?

40:37.903 --> 40:41.006
