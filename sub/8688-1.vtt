21:38.774 --> 21:42.152
shrink the Tiki Man down,

21:38.774 --> 21:42.152
and I wouldn't notice.

21:42.193 --> 21:43.570
Well, guess what, Wayne?

21:44.237 --> 21:45.447
I noticed!

21:47.031 --> 21:49.242
Now, Diane. Calm down.

21:49.284 --> 21:52.954
How can I calm down? I am

21:49.284 --> 21:52.954
smaller than a raisin!

21:49.284 --> 21:52.954
Diane...

21:52.996 --> 21:55.582
If you think about

21:52.996 --> 21:55.582
this with a modicum

21:52.996 --> 21:55.582
of hindsight, you...

21:55.624 --> 21:57.793
Oh, stop trying to use

21:55.624 --> 21:57.793
your interpersonal skills

21:57.835 --> 21:59.961
to smooth things over!

He's dragged us

21:57.835 --> 21:59.961
into it, too.

22:00.003 --> 22:01.588
Can I just

22:00.003 --> 22:01.588
say something?

22:00.003 --> 22:01.588
No! You cannot.

Please, could we argue

22:04.466 --> 22:07.678
somewhere else?

22:07.719 --> 22:09.721
I don't think it's real

22:07.719 --> 22:09.721
safe here on the floor.

22:07.719 --> 22:09.721
That's true.

22:09.763 --> 22:11.473
We gotta get away

22:09.763 --> 22:11.473
from the shoes

22:09.763 --> 22:11.473
and the cockroaches.

22:11.515 --> 22:13.141
The shoes?

22:11.515 --> 22:13.141
Cockroaches?

22:13.183 --> 22:15.352
There are cockroaches here?

22:13.183 --> 22:15.352
Well, it's an attic!

22:15.393 --> 22:17.395
I hate cockroaches!

22:17.437 --> 22:20.064
That's just regular-sized

22:20.106 --> 22:22.066
not cockroaches

22:22.108 --> 22:24.194
that wicker chair,

22:24.235 --> 22:26.237
Okay, that's great!

Let's get going, 'cause this

22:26.279 --> 22:28.114
is gonna take a long time.

22:30.784 --> 22:32.577

22:32.619 --> 22:35.706

out of a bad situation?

is walk across this...

Gordon, that is not

23:29.801 --> 23:32.095
a footbridge. It's a stick.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.567
(ECHOING) I'm walking

24:11.635 --> 24:15.096
in a hardware store.

But it has performed better

24:15.138 --> 24:16.347
in my wind tunnel tests

your dad'll let us

be gone, then.

25:49.273 --> 25:53.111
Yeah. So what now?

25:53.152 --> 25:56.907
Of course, as soon as

25:53.152 --> 25:56.907
the kids realize we're gone,

25:53.152 --> 25:56.907
they'll be very upset.

our parents are shrunk."

26:05.874 --> 26:08.668
Yeah, that's true.

26:05.874 --> 26:08.668
And there's no reason

26:05.874 --> 26:08.668
for them to come up here,

26:08.710 --> 26:09.627
so we gotta get to them.

26:11.170 --> 26:13.631
Well, how? We'll never

26:11.170 --> 26:13.631
get down the stairs alive.

to go straight out the window

The shortest distance

26:22.766 --> 26:25.560
between two points

26:22.766 --> 26:25.560
is a straight line.

26:27.604 --> 26:29.856
use to transport us down.

26:29.898 --> 26:32.150
But what could it be?

26:32.191 --> 26:33.985

something like

28:18.756 --> 28:20.758
We are

28:18.756 --> 28:20.758
in serious trouble.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.511
Oh, come on, Patty.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.511
It won't be that bad.

28:23.553 --> 28:25.180
I mean, we'll have to find

28:23.553 --> 28:25.180
a shoe to live in.

28:25.222 --> 28:26.556
But the kids

28:25.222 --> 28:26.556
are messy eaters.

28:26.597 --> 28:28.225
There'll be plenty

28:26.597 --> 28:28.225
of crumbs for us to eat.

28:28.266 --> 28:30.476
Wayne, we're not gonna spend

28:28.266 --> 28:30.476
the rest of our lives tiny.

28:30.518 --> 28:32.520
We're going

28:30.518 --> 28:32.520
to get big again.

28:32.562 --> 28:36.149
Somehow. Some way.

28:32.562 --> 28:36.149
We'll get our

28:32.562 --> 28:36.149
kids' attention.

28:36.191 --> 28:39.443
How? They hardly listen

28:36.191 --> 28:39.443
to us when we're full-sized.

28:36.191 --> 28:39.443
Now it'll be impossible.

28:40.737 --> 28:45.075
Unless... We can make

28:40.737 --> 28:45.075
our voices full-sized!

28:45.116 --> 28:46.159
Well, there's gotta

28:45.116 --> 28:46.159
be a way!

28:46.201 --> 28:48.078
have a bullhorn?

28:48.119 --> 28:52.040
Or a karaoke machine?

28:48.119 --> 28:52.040
No.

28:52.082 --> 28:56.460
Hey, I got it! I can

28:52.082 --> 28:56.460
rewire the stereo so we can

28:52.082 --> 28:56.460
talk through the speakers.

28:56.502 --> 28:59.505
That would amplify our

28:56.502 --> 28:59.505
voices 100 times!

28:56.502 --> 28:59.505
And that'll work?

28:59.547 --> 29:02.759
Sure. Just slip in through

28:59.547 --> 29:02.759

28:59.547 --> 29:02.759

51:02.827 --> 51:04.787
Come on, guys.

51:02.827 --> 51:04.787
Let's show 'em how

51:02.827 --> 51:04.787
to have a real party.

51:05.788 --> 51:07.541
Man, this place is hot.

51:07.583 --> 51:09.667
GIRL: Ricky King!

51:07.583 --> 51:09.667
How are you?

51:12.670 --> 51:14.339
RICKY: Hello, girls.

51:12.670 --> 51:14.339
HOLLY: Hi, Ricky!

51:14.381 --> 51:16.508
GORDON: Oh, great.

51:14.381 --> 51:16.508
Teenage boys.

51:16.550 --> 51:18.468
There are now

51:16.550 --> 51:18.468
teenage boys

51:16.550 --> 51:18.468

51:18.510 --> 51:20.929
Hey! My stereo!

51:18.510 --> 51:20.929
Hey, my daughter.

51:22.347 --> 51:23.681
Maybe there's

51:22.347 --> 51:23.681
a stepladder.

51:24.182 --> 51:25.308

51:31.481 --> 51:35.026
God, why didn't I squash him

51:31.481 --> 51:35.026
when I had the chance?

51:35.068 --> 51:38.363
Excellent CDs.

51:35.068 --> 51:38.363
Um, do you have

51:35.068 --> 51:38.363
a remote around here?

51:40.782 --> 51:44.578
Yeah. Do you want me

51:40.782 --> 51:44.578
to turn it on?

51:40.782 --> 51:44.578
Uh, no.

51:44.620 --> 51:46.746
I want you to

51:44.620 --> 51:46.746
hand it over.

51:46.788 --> 51:48.624
No. Give me that!

51:49.958 --> 51:51.167
(LAUGHING)

51:53.169 --> 51:54.504
Watch this.

51:56.214 --> 51:57.006
Hey, I wanna

51:56.214 --> 51:57.006
sit there, man.

51:57.048 --> 51:58.133
Hmm?

51:59.050 --> 52:00.093
(GIRLS LAUGHING)

52:00.135 --> 52:02.471
Hey, cut it out!

52:00.135 --> 52:02.471
He was there first!

52:02.512 --> 52:04.222
So what,

52:02.512 --> 52:04.222
he had dibs on it?

52:04.264 --> 52:05.765
This gum wrapper

52:04.264 --> 52:05.765
will do the trick.

52:07.225 --> 52:09.603
What are these

52:07.225 --> 52:09.603
little kids doing here?

52:09.645 --> 52:11.896
Yeah. I mean,

52:09.645 --> 52:11.896
you're too small.

52:11.938 --> 52:15.692
You must be, um, this

52:11.938 --> 52:15.692
tall to stay downstairs.

52:15.733 --> 52:16.943
(GIRLS LAUGH)

52:15.733 --> 52:16.943
MITCH: I'm calling mom.

52:16.985 --> 52:19.362
This is getting

52:16.985 --> 52:19.362
way out of hand.

52:19.404 --> 52:22.532
Who does he think he is?

52:19.404 --> 52:22.532
You can't push my kid

52:19.404 --> 52:22.532
around like that!

52:22.574 --> 52:24.409
You are dead meat, mister!

52:24.451 --> 52:26.744
Gordon. You're three quarters

52:24.451 --> 52:26.744
of an inch tall.

52:24.451 --> 52:26.744
Now is not the time.

52:26.786 --> 52:27.829
Now, help me

52:26.786 --> 52:27.829
with this foil!

52:31.166 --> 52:33.751
Why isn't

52:31.166 --> 52:33.751
he coming after us?

52:31.166 --> 52:33.751
I don't know.

52:34.544 --> 52:35.753
Maybe he's gone.

52:40.133 --> 52:42.678
Oh, look, his leg is caught

52:40.133 --> 52:42.678
in the spider web.

52:44.262 --> 52:48.224
Oh, that's so sad.

52:44.262 --> 52:48.224
And daddy longlegs

52:44.262 --> 52:48.224
are good bugs.

52:48.266 --> 52:50.893
They eat mosquitoes

52:48.266 --> 52:50.893
and leave humans

52:48.266 --> 52:50.893
entirely alone.

52:50.935 --> 52:53.396
What? Is there

52:50.935 --> 52:53.396
a daddy longlegs

positive information?

52:56.232 --> 52:58.485
Let's go.

52:56.232 --> 52:58.485
No, Diane. I think

52:56.232 --> 52:58.485
we should help him.

52:59.194 --> 53:00.445
(STRUGGLING)

53:02.656 --> 53:06.618
Daddy, we're your friends.

53:13.291 --> 53:15.585
Um... Diane.

53:15.627 --> 53:17.795
Do you have a, um...

53:15.627 --> 53:17.795
A nail file?

53:19.214 --> 53:21.675
Yes.

53:19.214 --> 53:21.675
Okay.

53:21.717 --> 53:24.302
'Cause while I'm filing,

53:21.717 --> 53:24.302
I want you to talk to him.

53:24.344 --> 53:26.638
You know, distract him

53:28.306 --> 53:31.100
Talk to him?

53:28.306 --> 53:31.100
Talk to a bug.

53:28.306 --> 53:31.100
You know.

53:31.142 --> 53:33.562
Find some common ground.

53:33.603 --> 53:35.271
You both spend

53:33.603 --> 53:35.271
a lot of time

53:33.603 --> 53:35.271
in this kitchen.

53:37.607 --> 53:39.317
(SIGHING)

53:37.607 --> 53:39.317
All righty.

Hi. My name's Diane.

53:46.575 --> 53:49.952
I see you've been

53:46.575 --> 53:49.952

53:46.575 --> 53:49.952

53:57.377 --> 53:59.379
It's okay. It's okay.

53:57.377 --> 53:59.379
He likes you.

53:59.421 --> 54:00.838
Just keep talking.

54:02.257 --> 54:04.342
What can we talk about?

54:04.384 --> 54:06.762
Let's see.

54:04.384 --> 54:06.762
Uh, you have any kids?

54:06.803 --> 54:08.722
(CHIRPS)

54:06.803 --> 54:08.722
Silly me.

54:06.803 --> 54:08.722
You probably have hundreds.

54:10.390 --> 54:12.850
Oh, oh!

54:10.390 --> 54:12.850
That better?

54:13.810 --> 54:14.852
Thank you.

54:15.853 --> 54:17.855
Oh, we've had

54:15.853 --> 54:17.855
such a lousy day.

54:19.148 --> 54:21.025
You've had a pretty bad one

54:19.148 --> 54:21.025
yourself, haven't you?

54:23.361 --> 54:24.738
But for you,

54:25.947 --> 54:27.699
you're used to being small.

54:29.284 --> 54:32.287
For us, it's a completely

54:29.284 --> 54:32.287
new experience.

54:32.328 --> 54:34.456
For me, very scary.

54:35.791 --> 54:37.793
Although, you know,

54:35.791 --> 54:37.793
parts of it were actually...

54:38.918 --> 54:39.919
Kind of nice.

That's weird.

55:23.880 --> 55:24.922
Okay. Bye.

55:26.758 --> 55:27.967
They said our moms

55:26.758 --> 55:27.967
never made it.

55:28.926 --> 55:31.387
You're kidding.

55:28.926 --> 55:31.387
No.

55:31.429 --> 55:34.056
Okay. Well, let's

55:31.429 --> 55:34.056
just call our dads.

55:34.098 --> 55:35.141
But they didn't

55:34.098 --> 55:35.141
leave a number.

55:36.267 --> 55:38.770
Okay. Just calm down.

55:36.267 --> 55:38.770
Don't panic.

55:38.812 --> 55:41.981
But if our moms

55:38.812 --> 55:41.981
aren't at that place,

55:38.812 --> 55:41.981
then where are they?

55:42.023 --> 55:43.775
PATTY: So tell me

55:42.023 --> 55:43.775
how you do that again?

55:43.817 --> 55:45.902
Okay. So then I just

55:43.817 --> 55:45.902
toss in some garbanzo beans

55:45.943 --> 55:47.445
and crumble in

55:45.943 --> 55:47.445
some tortilla chips,

55:47.487 --> 55:49.280
and I call it

55:47.487 --> 55:49.280
a Mexican salad.

55:50.782 --> 55:52.367
try that sometime.

55:52.408 --> 55:54.118
The other thing,

55:52.408 --> 55:54.118
you can call something

55:52.408 --> 55:54.118
a Chinese salad

55:54.160 --> 55:55.953
if you throw in some of

55:54.160 --> 55:55.953
those mandarin oranges

and some of those

55:55.995 --> 55:57.997

we split up.

56:16.391 --> 56:18.601
into the mid-range.

56:18.643 --> 56:21.479
I'm gonna rewire

56:18.643 --> 56:21.479
the stereo so the speaker

56:18.643 --> 56:21.479
becomes a microphone.

56:21.521 --> 56:24.982
Now, when the music cuts out,

56:21.521 --> 56:24.982
you yell into that speaker

56:21.521 --> 56:24.982
as loud as you can.

56:25.942 --> 56:27.443
All right. I'm goin' in.

1:04:47.776 --> 1:04:49.237
BOY: Huh?

1:04:47.776 --> 1:04:49.237
GIRL: Shh.

1:04:51.822 --> 1:04:52.948
Who said that?

1:04:52.990 --> 1:04:55.743
This is the voice

1:04:52.990 --> 1:04:55.743
of G... God.

1:04:57.412 --> 1:05:00.706
Yes! God is

1:04:57.412 --> 1:05:00.706
talking to you.

1:05:00.748 --> 1:05:03.709
And I want you all

1:05:00.748 --> 1:05:03.709
to leave this house!

1:05:07.213 --> 1:05:08.589
God sounds

1:05:07.213 --> 1:05:08.589
a lot like Dad.

1:05:09.548 --> 1:05:10.883
Yeah, you're right.

1:05:10.925 --> 1:05:12.676
Is he here?

1:05:12.718 --> 1:05:14.303
GORDON: Normally,

1:05:12.718 --> 1:05:14.303
I would have been silent.

1:05:14.345 --> 1:05:17.514
But your outrageous

1:05:14.345 --> 1:05:17.514
behavior tonight has

1:05:14.345 --> 1:05:17.514
forced me to speak!

1:05:19.016 --> 1:05:20.393
It's just a trick.

1:05:20.435 --> 1:05:23.020
GORDON:

1:05:20.435 --> 1:05:23.020
Is that so, Ricky King?

1:05:23.062 --> 1:05:25.273
Then how come I know

1:05:23.062 --> 1:05:25.273
you live on Sycamore?

1:05:25.314 --> 1:05:28.401
Your dad's name is Mel.

1:05:25.314 --> 1:05:28.401
And your mom is...

1:05:30.903 --> 1:05:32.280
Cindy!

1:05:34.198 --> 1:05:35.450
This is getting weird.

1:05:35.491 --> 1:05:38.286
Now I said I want you out!

1:05:38.327 --> 1:05:41.538
What's the...

1:05:38.327 --> 1:05:41.538
O-U-T!

1:05:42.539 --> 1:05:45.000
Let's go, guys.

1:05:42.539 --> 1:05:45.000
Yes. Oh, yes. Run.

1:05:45.042 --> 1:05:46.835
Quickly. Run.

1:05:46.877 --> 1:05:49.088
(GIRLS EXCLAIMING)

1:05:46.877 --> 1:05:49.088
Or I will swoop down,

1:05:49.130 --> 1:05:52.591
and teach you all a lesson

1:05:49.130 --> 1:05:52.591
in proper party etiquette!

1:05:52.633 --> 1:05:56.053
I will bring plaque

1:05:52.633 --> 1:05:56.053
to your tiny teeth.

1:05:56.095 --> 1:05:58.139
So brush,

1:05:56.095 --> 1:05:58.139
I tell you! Brush!

1:05:58.180 --> 1:05:59.265
(LAUGHS)

1:05:59.307 --> 1:06:00.641
Okay, Dad.

1:05:59.307 --> 1:06:00.641
They're gone.

1:06:00.682 --> 1:06:02.393
You can stop

1:06:00.682 --> 1:06:02.393
acting like God now.

1:06:03.144 --> 1:06:06.439
Oh. Sorry.

1:06:06.481 --> 1:06:07.773
So, uh,

1:06:06.481 --> 1:06:07.773
where's the camera?

1:06:09.191 --> 1:06:10.692
Yeah. Where are you

1:06:09.191 --> 1:06:10.692
broadcasting from?

1:06:10.734 --> 1:06:12.694
GORDON: Right here,

1:06:10.734 --> 1:06:12.694
in the room.

1:06:12.736 --> 1:06:13.988
Your dad shrunk us.

1:06:15.656 --> 1:06:17.032
You're kidding.

1:06:17.074 --> 1:06:18.617
No. Now give me a hand.

1:06:18.659 --> 1:06:20.453
I'm over here

1:06:18.659 --> 1:06:20.453
by the left speaker.

1:06:26.708 --> 1:06:28.627
That means he saw us

1:06:26.708 --> 1:06:28.627
rollerblading in the house.

1:06:30.671 --> 1:06:32.465
And I wasn't

1:06:30.671 --> 1:06:32.465
wearing my pads.

1:06:37.553 --> 1:06:40.556
You know, Dad, I didn't

1:06:37.553 --> 1:06:40.556
invite those boys over.

1:06:40.597 --> 1:06:43.684
I swear.

1:06:40.597 --> 1:06:43.684
I know. I know.

1:06:43.725 --> 1:06:46.103
Wayne and I saw everything.

1:06:46.145 --> 1:06:48.647
That's right. You weren't

1:06:46.145 --> 1:06:48.647
in the kitchen, were you?

1:06:49.731 --> 1:06:50.732
No! No.

1:06:53.361 --> 1:06:54.611
But your mothers were.

1:06:55.612 --> 1:06:57.198
Oh, God.

1:06:57.239 --> 1:06:58.824
I told you I saw them.

1:06:58.866 --> 1:07:00.368
Now, listen to me, kids.

1:07:00.409 --> 1:07:02.744
These may be the most

1:07:00.409 --> 1:07:02.744
important instructions

1:07:00.409 --> 1:07:02.744
I ever give you.

1:07:02.786 --> 1:07:04.830
Jenny. Go run and find

1:07:02.786 --> 1:07:04.830
a piece of paper.

1:07:04.872 --> 1:07:06.165
And, Adam,

1:07:04.872 --> 1:07:06.165
go up to your room.

1:07:06.207 --> 1:07:07.958
Look under

1:07:06.207 --> 1:07:07.958
the laundry basket.

1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:09.918
Get the shark car.

1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:09.918
Come on down here.

1:07:09.960 --> 1:07:11.628

1:07:09.960 --> 1:07:11.628
in front of the receiver.

1:07:12.713 --> 1:07:14.715

1:07:12.713 --> 1:07:14.715
over here.

1:07:12.713 --> 1:07:14.715
Okay.

1:07:14.756 --> 1:07:16.675
Careful not to squish 'em.

1:07:14.756 --> 1:07:16.675
No, no, no, no!

1:07:20.846 --> 1:07:23.140
Don't move anything.

1:07:23.182 --> 1:07:25.767
ADAM: Okay, Uncle Gordon.

1:07:23.182 --> 1:07:25.767
Hop in. Now let's go

1:07:23.182 --> 1:07:25.767

1:07:32.149 --> 1:07:33.692

1:07:34.651 --> 1:07:35.944

1:08:20.114 --> 1:08:22.116

We wait until

1:08:22.157 --> 1:08:24.326
it hits critical mass,

1:08:24.368 --> 1:08:25.702
and then push this button.

1:08:29.039 --> 1:08:32.167
Wait a minute.

1:08:29.039 --> 1:08:32.167
Do we really

1:08:29.039 --> 1:08:32.167
want to do this?

1:08:35.630 --> 1:08:36.838
leave 'em shrunk,

1:08:36.880 --> 1:08:38.715
and they'll never tell us

1:08:36.880 --> 1:08:38.715
what to do again.

Wow, total freedom.

1:11:12.953 --> 1:11:14.747
(ALL LAUGHING)

1:11:18.333 --> 1:11:21.336
WAYNE: I had no idea

1:11:18.333 --> 1:11:21.336
baseball had that

1:11:18.333 --> 1:11:21.336
much math in it,

1:11:21.378 --> 1:11:23.756
or that my son would be

1:11:21.378 --> 1:11:23.756
such a good catcher.

1:11:23.798 --> 1:11:26.091
Yeah. I bet you were

1:11:23.798 --> 1:11:26.091
the only dad there

1:11:26.133 --> 1:11:27.884
that could figure out

1:11:26.133 --> 1:11:27.884
the whole team's

1:11:27.926 --> 1:11:30.471
batting average

1:11:27.926 --> 1:11:30.471
instantly in his head.

1:11:30.512 --> 1:11:32.013
We're just glad you

1:11:30.512 --> 1:11:32.013
had a good time, honey,

1:11:32.055 --> 1:11:33.766
and even happier

1:11:32.055 --> 1:11:33.766
you're home.

1:11:33.808 --> 1:11:36.017
Yeah, it's good

1:11:33.808 --> 1:11:36.017
to be back.

1:11:36.059 --> 1:11:38.019
Hey, did you make any

1:11:36.059 --> 1:11:38.019
changes while I was gone?

1:11:41.231 --> 1:11:43.942
Well, I did

1:11:41.231 --> 1:11:43.942
move the Tiki Man

1:11:41.231 --> 1:11:43.942
into the backyard.

1:11:46.111 --> 1:11:46.903
What do you think?
