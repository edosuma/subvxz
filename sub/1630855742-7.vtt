02:44.289 --> 02:46.917
<i>I would like
all you summa cum laude needle dicks</i>

02:46.917 --> 02:51.255
to stop headfucking
the deal points and start closing.

02:52.089 --> 02:55.467
Close, close, close,
like your life depends on it.

02:55.467 --> 02:58.929
You're a primordial man on the savanna.
It's hot.

02:59.638 --> 03:04.685
That antelope is faster, but you are
fucking ravenous, and you can smell it.

03:04.685 --> 03:08.146
The antelope is getting tired,
and you've got a rock in your hand.

03:08.146 --> 03:11.859
All that's left to do
is bludgeon that poor beast to death.

03:11.859 --> 03:16.488
So, I don't want to hear any more about
preferred stock or debt assumption.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.615
I want death in the afternoon.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.453
Cory, I need a word.

03:24.371 --> 03:28.041
I know you reached out to her.
And I'm not blaming you, she is a legend.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.294
- What are we talking about?
- Don't play coy.

03:30.294 --> 03:35.674
This is a serious fuckup. She's been
calling the Justice Department every day.

03:35.674 --> 03:39.720
The IG is spooked now,
and if this doesn't stop,

03:40.262 --> 03:41.847
they're gonna put us under review.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.432
It's fine, I'll talk to her.

03:43.432 --> 03:48.687
Shut her down. We don't need this kind
of scrutiny. Not right now.

03:48.687 --> 03:52.149
- I said I'd handle it.
- Good. Do that.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.072
Your two o'clock is running late.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.866
Cancel my afternoon
and have my car pulled around, okay?

04:00.866 --> 04:02.951
- Got it. Should I send your tux somewhere?
- No, it's a quick trip.

04:02.951 --> 04:06.038
Wait, Bradley wanted
to talk to you. She's in your office.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.587
Bradley Jackson,
to what do I owe the pleasure?

04:13.587 --> 04:19.760
Hey. Yeah, I just wanted to see if you
got the text that I sent you about Hal.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.637
I just didn't hear back from you.

04:22.304 --> 04:24.515
But needless to say,
it's all taken care of,

04:24.515 --> 04:26.642
and he's really getting his shit together

04:26.642 --> 04:29.811
and just really focusing
on being a good dad.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.981
And you're Aunt Bradley now.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.192
Yeah, that's right. It's kind of amazing.

04:36.068 --> 04:38.612
But I just wanted to say sorry
about the other day,

04:38.612 --> 04:42.324
'cause I know when he is here,
it can be a little hectic.

04:42.324 --> 04:45.244
Hey, I have to head up to Connecticut
for a quick meeting.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.871
Why don't you come up with me?
We can talk about it in the car.

04:49.206 --> 04:52.584
Yeah, I just have to be back here
by 5:00 p.m. to do the news.

04:52.584 --> 04:55.045
It won't take long. I'll have you back
in time for the news and the party.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.006
Well, what's in Connecticut?

04:58.006 --> 04:59.800
Well, it's not a what, it's a who.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.427
A political strategist
with connections to the DOJ.

05:02.427 --> 05:05.806
She's making calls about the deal,
and we need her to stop

05:05.806 --> 05:07.641
before she blows up
the whole goddamn thing.

05:08.267 --> 05:10.644
Yeah, okay.
But why don't you just call her?

05:10.644 --> 05:13.063
Yeah, 'cause she needs a little handling.

05:13.564 --> 05:18.110
And if you're there, she will be on
her best behavior. We will be in and out.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.654
Okay.

05:23.323 --> 05:27.494
There's a couple options
for breakfast that we can order from the--

05:27.494 --> 05:31.290
Okay, well, why don't you put that away?
I am making you a frittata.

05:33.876 --> 05:35.836
Well, should I make some toast?

05:35.836 --> 05:38.505
Toast is already toasting.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.178
Maybe some fruit. I'll cut up
a little bit of this cantaloupe.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.429
Or, Alex,

05:45.429 --> 05:51.393
you could just sit back and relax
and let me make you breakfast.

05:52.561 --> 05:53.812
Okay.

05:53.812 --> 05:55.772
- Okay. Coffee's ready.
- Thank you.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.524
Thank you.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.359
You're welcome.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.342
Pretty nice, huh?

06:24.301 --> 06:25.802
Well, that's an understatement.

06:27.346 --> 06:30.849
Did you know that you talk in your sleep?

06:31.517 --> 06:34.019
I absolutely do not.

06:34.811 --> 06:35.646
Okay.

06:38.232 --> 06:40.567
Okay. What did I say?

06:41.151 --> 06:43.654
You were saying something about Dana.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.368
Yes, Dana.

06:50.494 --> 06:52.913
So, is that an ex-girlfriend?

06:52.913 --> 06:54.456
Favorite stripper?

06:54.456 --> 06:56.333
Well, I could never
have a favorite stripper.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.417
My gosh.

06:58.836 --> 07:03.757
No. Dana was the love of my life.
She could do no wrong.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.219
The one that got away?

07:07.219 --> 07:12.683
Yeah, you could say that. She was my dog
that I had growing up as a kid.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.019
A dog-- Dana?

07:16.812 --> 07:21.400
Hey, listen, I just wanted to say
that it has been a long time

07:21.400 --> 07:22.734
since I've done anything like this.

07:24.653 --> 07:28.073
I don't date a lot of people.

07:28.824 --> 07:31.368
Come on. I call bullshit.

07:31.368 --> 07:32.452
Really?

07:32.953 --> 07:35.205
Divorced, workaholic, control freak.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.373
How appealing does that sound?

07:37.082 --> 07:39.543
That sounds very, very, very familiar.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.673
Scared my daughter all the way
back to England to live with her father.

07:45.549 --> 07:48.260
So, that says a lot about me.

07:48.260 --> 07:51.221
Well, I don't know.
I mean, 20 years of marriage.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.682
You lasted a lot longer than I did.

07:53.682 --> 07:57.477
No, well, it was over way before we--
The divorce was final.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.521
It was just--
I was afraid of what people would think.

08:00.189 --> 08:01.982
I just didn't want to hear the noise.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.862
I think it's why I packed
that part of me away a long time ago.

08:07.362 --> 08:11.867
You know, you do get used to it though.
Being alone.

08:15.787 --> 08:18.832
Mm-hmm. I think it's why this is
a little terrifying. Just a little bit.

08:18.832 --> 08:19.917
Yeah.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.001
Right?

08:21.001 --> 08:22.085
I get it.

08:25.631 --> 08:30.219
Well, I don't wanna stop.

08:30.219 --> 08:31.303
Do you?

08:43.273 --> 08:44.274
<i>Hello?</i>

08:45.400 --> 08:47.069
Pavlo, you're a difficult man
to get a hold of.

08:47.069 --> 08:49.029
- <i>I'm busy.</i>
- Okay, then I'll make this quick.

08:49.029 --> 08:53.575
That photographer, André, did you
get him out of Mariupol two weeks ago?

08:53.575 --> 08:54.826
<i>Who?</i>

08:56.203 --> 08:58.372
The hospital bombing.

08:59.623 --> 09:04.545
We paid you to get André in and out, remember?

09:05.796 --> 09:08.215
So, did you get him out?

09:10.968 --> 09:13.095
He risked his life
to get that footage. Do you understand?

09:13.095 --> 09:15.722
<i>I don't know where he is.</i>

09:18.350 --> 09:19.351
So, find him!

09:24.314 --> 09:25.858
Amanda, hi.

09:27.276 --> 09:30.320
Paul looped me in
on the conversation you had last week

09:30.320 --> 09:32.698
and asked that I deliver this in person.

09:33.407 --> 09:37.077
Yeah. About that.
I'm gonna need my team to look it over.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.706
They can reach out to me directly,
but there are no surprises in here.

09:41.206 --> 09:42.332
Thanks. I'll take a look.

09:44.001 --> 09:47.087
Paul is very excited
to be back in business with you.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.186
Wait, we're not going to an office?

10:02.686 --> 10:04.938
Nope, this is it.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.234
Okay.

10:11.069 --> 10:12.070
Cory?

10:12.070 --> 10:13.488
All right, just one sec.

10:32.174 --> 10:33.175
Okay, let's go.

10:34.593 --> 10:35.594
Okay.

10:54.821 --> 10:55.822
Hi, Mom.

10:59.993 --> 11:00.994
That's Bradley.

11:02.788 --> 11:03.789
Hello.

11:04.623 --> 11:05.791
Hi.

11:07.459 --> 11:08.544
Where are you going?

11:08.544 --> 11:11.171
Well, I thought you said I had to scoot.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.215
Well, that was a terrible idea.

11:13.215 --> 11:16.385
- I think so too.
- I mean-- Okay.

11:17.761 --> 11:19.680
- So then I'll see you tonight.
- Yes. Yeah.

11:19.680 --> 11:23.100
Speaking of, you and me and this whole--

11:23.100 --> 11:25.769
Terrible look. Press will not like it.

11:25.769 --> 11:29.064
Neither will the board.
So, at the party, we will be cordial.

11:29.565 --> 11:30.399
Friendly.

11:30.399 --> 11:33.986
- Yes. Not too friendly.
- No, appropriate amount of friendly.

11:33.986 --> 11:35.404
Right, just appropriate.

11:35.404 --> 11:36.488
Yeah.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.704
- Too much?
- Feel like that's--

11:43.704 --> 11:46.164
- Just a tiny bit.
- Too much. Okay. I'll go. I'll get going.

12:15.277 --> 12:18.197
Hey, there. Still works.

12:21.617 --> 12:24.828
I was looking through your SEC filings.

12:24.828 --> 12:28.457
You love a bit of light reading,
don't you? What'd you think?

12:29.041 --> 12:31.752
Surprised at how low
your content library's valued.

12:32.336 --> 12:35.422
- You have very strong franchises.
- Well, that's the way the bankers play it.

12:35.422 --> 12:38.050
They undervalue the library,
so the shareholders are thrilled

12:38.050 --> 12:39.718
that Paul Marks is paying a premium.

12:40.552 --> 12:44.431
Your business,
it's all smoke and mirrors, isn't it?

12:44.431 --> 12:47.976
Media is politics by another name.

12:48.602 --> 12:54.191
Mom is a genius.
You wanna win votes, you talk to her.

12:55.234 --> 12:56.652
I'm happy that you made the time
to see us.

12:56.652 --> 12:59.738
I know that you've got a couple of things
cooking in DC.

12:59.738 --> 13:01.865
Please. You know I don't do much.

13:02.741 --> 13:04.284
Just a little consulting.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.786
It's a lot more than that.

13:05.786 --> 13:08.080
Hey, why don't you show
Bradley your office?

13:13.168 --> 13:14.002
Wow.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.880
Oh, yeah.
Mom was Ferraro's press secretary.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.257
Really?

13:18.257 --> 13:21.552
I loved her.
She got a little kooky towards the end,

13:21.552 --> 13:24.972
but that's what happens
when you're a woman in politics.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.306
It breaks everyone.

13:27.391 --> 13:31.144
You'll see, when you get to my age,
how far you've come

13:31.144 --> 13:32.396
and how far you have to go.

13:34.565 --> 13:38.360
The current is so strong, you wonder
if you're swimming forward at all.

13:39.862 --> 13:43.824
There. Honorary campaign member.

13:43.824 --> 13:46.827
Are you sure? I mean, she's such an icon.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.704
You're an icon, Bradley Jackson.

13:49.705 --> 13:52.875
True feminist.
Cory was smart to bring you in.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.502
Well, we're all fighting the good fight.

13:56.795 --> 13:59.214
It was a proud moment for women everywhere

13:59.214 --> 14:02.509
when you told the world on live TV
that you had an abortion.

14:04.469 --> 14:06.138
Thank you for saying that, Martha.

14:06.722 --> 14:08.473
So many of us didn't have a choice.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.476
Not that I don't love my boy...

14:13.562 --> 14:15.772
but it would have been nice
to have had a choice.

14:15.772 --> 14:19.818
It's okay, Mom. I know that you can hold
both things in your heart.

14:19.818 --> 14:22.571
Speaking of your illustrious career, I
wanted to bend your ear

14:22.571 --> 14:24.615
- about something--
- Oh, no, no. I'm not listening.

14:24.615 --> 14:26.658
No more business till after we eat.

14:27.409 --> 14:29.578
I bought some lobster.

14:29.578 --> 14:31.079
Wow. Thank you.

14:32.664 --> 14:35.959
Yeah, I'm not sure
we're gonna have time to have a meal.

14:36.877 --> 14:39.254
Only because I have to do the news.

14:40.714 --> 14:41.715
I see.

14:42.424 --> 14:43.467
A short visit.

14:47.346 --> 14:50.516
Well, we'll just have to make the best
of the time we have.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.977
Will you excuse me for a moment?

14:58.148 --> 14:59.149
Why'd you do that?

15:02.486 --> 15:05.989
What about the money?
It's low for a Fortune 500 CEO.

15:05.989 --> 15:09.493
I could quibble with the stock package,
but the fact is, you have no quotes,

15:09.493 --> 15:12.955
and the base
plus the bonus comes to 14 million a year.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.457
I feel like I'm in <i>The Twilight Zone</i>.

15:15.958 --> 15:19.461
Like, this doesn't happen, right?
This isn't normal.

15:19.461 --> 15:23.298
- It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
- And you think I should take it?

15:23.298 --> 15:25.384
I think
it's what you've been working towards.

15:25.884 --> 15:28.053
And you've always been ahead of the curve.

15:30.722 --> 15:34.852
Walk me through the timeline.
If I say yes, what happens next?

15:34.852 --> 15:37.104
We counter by the end of the week.

15:37.104 --> 15:40.232
Nothing excessive,
but there are a few places to come up.

15:40.232 --> 15:42.943
And there are some protections
that we'd need to build in.

15:42.943 --> 15:47.656
And then they would quietly start
to put together Cory's exit package,

15:47.656 --> 15:52.661
and you would decide
who at UBA would stay and who to replace.

15:52.661 --> 15:55.664
But we don't announce
until everything is ironclad.

15:56.874 --> 16:00.294
Right. What if I sign
and the deal falls apart?

16:02.838 --> 16:04.882
Ideally, no one ever knows
there was even an offer.

16:04.882 --> 16:09.386
Okay, but what if someone finds out?
What if Cory finds out?

16:11.680 --> 16:15.851
Things would become untenable at UBA.

16:17.227 --> 16:20.772
But we'd find
a safe place for you to land.

16:22.608 --> 16:25.068
So either Cory goes, or I do.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.576
Hey, Mom,
why don't you come up and join us?

16:32.576 --> 16:35.704
I don't think I will.
Tell Bradley I'm not feeling well.

16:36.788 --> 16:39.291
She doesn't want to be here,
and neither do you.

16:39.291 --> 16:41.251
That is absolutely not true.

16:41.251 --> 16:44.588
I really appreciate you having us over,
and so does Bradley.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.091
Do you remember the last time
you came to visit me?

16:50.219 --> 16:52.846
I know that it's been a while.

16:52.846 --> 16:57.017
It was a few months into the pandemic.
My friend Thomas died,

16:57.518 --> 17:02.105
and you came by, and we played dominoes
and listened to the rain.

17:03.899 --> 17:06.859
That was such a nice night.
It helped me through a difficult time.

17:09.780 --> 17:13.200
Hey, I'm sorry, Mom.
I've been really busy.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.743
I know that's not an excuse,
but it's true.

17:15.743 --> 17:19.414
And of course we can stay, okay?
We'll have an early dinner.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.627
- All right.
- Great. I'll get started in the kitchen.

17:26.755 --> 17:30.300
It's strange.
You look just like your father right now.

17:31.844 --> 17:35.055
You're about the same age he was
when he left us.

17:41.854 --> 17:42.855
We're staying for dinner.

17:43.355 --> 17:46.108
What? No. You said in and out.
I don't have time for this.

17:46.108 --> 17:48.360
- Bradley, this is important, okay?
- No. You don't need me here.

17:48.360 --> 17:51.530
- This is garden-variety mom shit.
- We will leave right after dinner.

17:51.530 --> 17:54.825
I gotta get back. I'm gonna text Gayle
and tell her I'm gonna be late.

17:54.825 --> 17:56.577
Don't worry about the evening news.

17:56.577 --> 17:59.955
What? You know,
my mom went through a meth phase,

17:59.955 --> 18:02.499
where she stole money
from my wallet and shit?

18:02.499 --> 18:05.210
Your mom actually seems sane,
and she cares about you.

18:05.210 --> 18:08.088
I emailed Gayle.
Josh is gonna cover evening for you.

18:09.464 --> 18:11.675
You can't do that.
That's-- This is my job.

18:11.675 --> 18:12.926
Hey, and I'm your boss.

18:13.468 --> 18:15.554
If you've got a problem with it,
you can talk to HR tomorrow.

18:15.554 --> 18:17.264
In the meantime,
there's a bottle of wine in the fridge.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.599
Why don't you open it, okay?

18:24.396 --> 18:26.690
- Alex, just--
- Yep. Sorry. Yes.

18:26.690 --> 18:28.775
I haven't been to one of these things
in forever.

18:29.401 --> 18:30.527
This is gonna be a fun one.

18:30.527 --> 18:33.697
Raise a million dollars
for the Fashion Institute.

18:33.697 --> 18:36.617
And it's a good photo op, right?

18:37.117 --> 18:39.536
Paul Marks and UBA's news anchors,

18:39.536 --> 18:41.955
showing the world how excited
we are about this deal.

18:43.457 --> 18:46.793
- Someone doesn't sound that excited.
- Yeah, I don't know.

18:46.793 --> 18:52.174
There are studies that show power,
it actually changes the brain.

18:52.174 --> 18:54.676
It erases the ability to empathize.

18:54.676 --> 18:58.180
It makes me wonder,
what does Paul Marks really care about?

18:58.931 --> 19:00.974
I-- Listen, just talk to him tonight.

19:00.974 --> 19:04.269
See what you think. I think
he's kind of interesting.

19:04.269 --> 19:05.979
Yeah, I'm a little nervous, though.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.106
- Why? Because of the carpet?
- Yeah.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.067
Interviews? Those people? The vultures?

19:10.067 --> 19:11.193
S-- Fuck 'em.

19:13.362 --> 19:15.197
- Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
- Fuck 'em.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.242
Martha, is there anything
I can help with?

19:18.242 --> 19:20.577
- I feel-- Okay.
- No, no. You just sit tight.

19:20.577 --> 19:25.165
This is an old family tradition.
Cory always does the honors.

19:25.749 --> 19:29.086
They scream. I find it very unsettling.

19:29.086 --> 19:31.672
Mom, that's just the steam escaping,
you know that.

19:31.672 --> 19:33.590
Do you always have to boil them alive?

19:33.590 --> 19:34.758
Yeah, it's the only way.

19:35.592 --> 19:38.011
Just think of them as bugs.

19:38.804 --> 19:42.850
Sometimes they thrash a little.
But Cory doesn't mind. He never has.

19:43.433 --> 19:44.935
Mom, we've had this conversation before.

19:45.435 --> 19:49.773
It is a little barbaric.
Poor things. Powerless to fight back.

19:53.110 --> 19:55.779
Now, Bradley, I don't want to pry,

19:55.779 --> 19:57.990
I don't even know if I'm allowed to ask,

19:57.990 --> 20:00.701
but what happened with Laura Peterson?

20:02.578 --> 20:03.662
Of course you can ask.

20:04.872 --> 20:07.708
Well, actually, during the pandemic,

20:07.708 --> 20:11.211
Laura and I had a bit of a rough go,
but my mother passed.

20:11.211 --> 20:14.089
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah. No, thank you.

20:15.465 --> 20:20.971
But we've just decided
that we're gonna give it another go.

20:21.638 --> 20:24.558
That's wonderful. I see.

20:25.851 --> 20:27.811
When you showed up with Cory today

20:28.312 --> 20:32.983
I thought-- Well, a little part of me
hoped that he was going--

20:32.983 --> 20:35.402
Mom. Bradley and I are colleagues.

20:35.402 --> 20:37.237
I just thought you two
would have a lot to talk about.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.198
Of course, of course. I'm sorry.

20:40.324 --> 20:43.952
I just wish I could convince him
to bring someone home.

20:45.329 --> 20:48.248
I haven't met a single woman Cory's dated.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.708
- No?
- All these years.

20:51.001 --> 20:53.295
I guess the right one
just hasn't come along yet.

20:59.593 --> 21:01.845
- Over here!
- Fantastic. Thank you.

21:01.845 --> 21:03.805
That's perfect. Thank you.

21:03.805 --> 21:05.140
To the left.

21:05.140 --> 21:07.684
Yanko, you know I gotta ask
about the hack.

21:07.684 --> 21:09.937
Oh, yeah, the hack.
Yeah, of course, the hack.

21:09.937 --> 21:13.857
Yeah. I mean, look, I could explain
my proclivity for women who--

21:13.857 --> 21:17.194
who are predominantly Slavic in origin.
I could do that.

21:17.194 --> 21:18.779
Should I have to? Absolutely not.

21:18.779 --> 21:20.906
I think my personal life
is my personal life. Right?

21:20.906 --> 21:22.866
No. I'm-- I meant more generally.

21:23.575 --> 21:25.661
Generally. Yeah. Of course. Yeah.

21:25.661 --> 21:29.206
- Chris Hunter. You look stunning.
- Thank you.

21:29.206 --> 21:30.999
Can you tell us what tonight is all about?

21:30.999 --> 21:34.211
Yeah. Well, we're partnering
with Valentino to support

21:34.211 --> 21:36.922
the Fashion Institute of Technology's
scholarship program.

21:36.922 --> 21:40.217
We wanna give a voice
to people who do not always have one.

21:40.217 --> 21:42.678
You have been doing
a lot of that lately.

21:42.678 --> 21:45.764
Any follow-up from your conversation
with Cybil Reynolds?

21:45.764 --> 21:48.183
Has UBA achieved your equity pay goals?

21:48.183 --> 21:49.393
They're working on it.

21:49.977 --> 21:51.061
So, that's a no.

21:51.061 --> 21:52.145
I would not be here tonight

21:52.145 --> 21:54.815
if I did not have faith
that UBA would do the right thing.

21:55.983 --> 21:57.484
Something we're all very passionate about.

21:57.484 --> 22:02.573
Over here! Alex! Over here!

22:03.991 --> 22:05.492
It was nice speaking.

22:05.492 --> 22:07.327
Likewise. Enjoy your night.

22:07.327 --> 22:08.579
You good?

22:08.579 --> 22:09.913
Yeah, still trying on

22:09.913 --> 22:12.499
this whole Social Justice Warrior thing.

22:12.499 --> 22:17.087
- Alex! Wow. Wow.
- Patrick. Hello. How are you?

22:17.087 --> 22:19.298
- I'm so great. You look amazing.
- Thank you.

22:19.298 --> 22:23.051
We've seen the promos for your interview
with Paul Marks on <i>Alex Unfiltered</i>.

22:23.051 --> 22:23.969
What can we expect?

22:23.969 --> 22:27.764
Well, I do not take it easy on him,
if that's what you're getting at.

22:27.764 --> 22:30.392
- Alex! Over here.
- Thank you.

22:30.392 --> 22:32.060
Alex, Paul, can we get a photo?

22:32.060 --> 22:34.354
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Marks.

22:35.063 --> 22:37.274
Wow, did Cary Grant just walk in the room?

22:38.066 --> 22:40.986
I didn't think I'd see you in a tie
unless you were in a coffin.

22:41.820 --> 22:44.156
I'm actually planning on being composted.

22:45.991 --> 22:47.993
- You look fucking amazing.
- Thank you.

22:47.993 --> 22:49.536
- Ms. Levy. May I?
- Oh, yes.

22:50.162 --> 22:51.205
You know what?

22:51.205 --> 22:52.456
Chris, get in this photo.

22:53.040 --> 22:56.043
- Don't wanna hog the man of the hour.
- Wow.

22:56.043 --> 22:57.836
- That's quite a dress.
- Thank you.

22:57.836 --> 23:00.422
- Closer together.
- Sure. Don't know where to put my hands.

23:03.592 --> 23:04.593
You're vibrating.

23:06.470 --> 23:08.055
Yes, I am. Sorry about that.

23:08.055 --> 23:09.264
- Mr. Marks.
- Sure.

23:09.264 --> 23:11.350
- Wow, this-- Thanks, guys. This was great.
- Thank you.

23:11.350 --> 23:13.185
Can you tell me about
Hyperion's upcoming launch?

23:13.185 --> 23:15.854
You're still on track for
an August launch of <i>Hyperion Two</i>?

23:15.854 --> 23:19.942
Yes. Yes, we are. In fact,
we are sending a few astronauts

23:19.942 --> 23:22.569
up to the International Space Station
to conduct some tests at NASA.

23:27.574 --> 23:28.909
Where's your suit?

23:28.909 --> 23:30.619
I'm gonna go change right now.

23:33.038 --> 23:35.541
Gayle says Joshua's ready
to broadcast downstairs at 6:30.

23:35.541 --> 23:36.458
Great.

23:37.876 --> 23:39.837
Have you heard from Pierpaolo
about tomorrow's show?

23:39.837 --> 23:41.672
- Got a couple of FIT students lined up...
- No.

23:41.672 --> 23:44.174
- ...so--
- But I'll let you know.

23:44.883 --> 23:46.134
Okay.

23:50.973 --> 23:53.433
- What's up, Stel?
- No, it's nothing. It's--

23:54.476 --> 23:57.020
It's just
your run-of-the-mill existential crisis.

23:59.231 --> 24:00.065
Talk to me.

24:03.026 --> 24:05.320
Do you think things
could be different around here?

24:06.196 --> 24:08.115
- Different how?
- Better programming.

24:08.115 --> 24:10.242
More resources for stories that matter.

24:10.242 --> 24:13.996
Younger voices. Less overt racism.

24:13.996 --> 24:15.455
Is that what Paul Marks wants?

24:15.455 --> 24:21.545
Not exactly, but he does want things
to change at the top.

24:23.297 --> 24:25.841
The very top.

24:26.550 --> 24:27.676
You mean Cory?

24:31.388 --> 24:32.264
Wow.

24:32.264 --> 24:33.765
It's crazy.

24:33.765 --> 24:37.603
And we are not having this conversation.

24:41.565 --> 24:43.108
Would you take that job?

24:43.108 --> 24:44.693
Wanna run the news division?

24:45.444 --> 24:48.697
Wow. Stella.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.117
Cory's been good to me.

24:52.117 --> 24:54.036
- Well...
- For the most part.

24:54.036 --> 24:57.080
But I have to do this. Right?

24:57.080 --> 24:59.124
Ask me how I felt when Chip got fired.

24:59.124 --> 25:03.754
Failure for Cory means a big, fat check
and another turn in the grand game of

25:04.463 --> 25:06.423
corporate musical chairs.

25:07.299 --> 25:11.678
There are only so many jobs at the top.
White men don't give them up willingly.

25:11.678 --> 25:13.764
No. They don't.

25:16.683 --> 25:19.811
But do I wanna be like them?

25:19.811 --> 25:23.565
Please. You already
stepped over a few bodies to get here.

25:25.317 --> 25:27.945
I think the only difference
between us and them...

25:30.072 --> 25:33.242
is that we let the ghosts torment us.

25:33.992 --> 25:34.993
They don't.

25:53.428 --> 25:56.723
- Pierpaolo.
- Hey. Ciao, Alex. You look beautiful.

25:57.683 --> 25:59.768
Well, thanks to your dress.

25:59.768 --> 26:01.144
- I want to talk to you...
- Yeah.

26:01.144 --> 26:02.646
- ...about the scholarship.
- Okay.

26:03.146 --> 26:05.107
I think we can do
much more for the students.

26:05.107 --> 26:07.651
This is something so close to my heart.

26:08.443 --> 26:10.904
Yes. Let's do it. Let's go talk it out.

26:16.076 --> 26:19.288
Yanko told me his date
canceled last minute.

26:19.288 --> 26:20.956
Is that the same girl?

26:20.956 --> 26:22.624
Oh, God. That poor guy.

26:23.417 --> 26:25.544
He can hang out with us, right?
I mean, we'll keep him company.

26:25.544 --> 26:27.337
Right? I mean, he'll be fine.

26:27.337 --> 26:29.673
But whatever you do, no talking politics.

26:29.673 --> 26:31.675
- It's not gonna end well...
- What I miss? Here you go.

26:31.675 --> 26:33.468
- Nothing.
- Alex. Hello.

26:33.468 --> 26:34.678
- Hey.
- Thank you.

26:34.678 --> 26:36.263
- Sure. Cheers, babe.
- Cheers.

26:36.263 --> 26:38.724
Babe, you think I can pull that suit off?

26:38.724 --> 26:40.559
- Oh, yeah. Pink all day.
- Oh, gosh.

26:40.559 --> 26:41.643
Pink all day.

26:41.643 --> 26:42.728
I think you can.

26:42.728 --> 26:44.229
- Excuse me for one second.
- Oh, yeah.

26:44.229 --> 26:46.565
Yeah. Well, I wanna know.
Because I want it taken care of.

26:47.065 --> 26:48.066
Yes.

26:49.735 --> 26:51.570
- Hi.
- Okay, yeah.

26:51.570 --> 26:53.071
- Hey.
- Hi.

26:53.071 --> 26:54.323
You don't seem okay.

26:54.907 --> 26:56.533
Yeah. Sorry.

26:57.701 --> 26:58.869
Just tell me what's going on.

26:58.869 --> 27:01.163
I mean,
you don't have to, but talk to me.

27:02.206 --> 27:06.460
<i>The Vault</i> has a picture of us.

27:07.169 --> 27:08.253
What?

27:09.004 --> 27:11.840
And it's pretty clear that we're together.

27:13.509 --> 27:15.928
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, no. I'm on it.

27:15.928 --> 27:18.597
I'll fix it.
I'll get rid of it. I'll take care of it.

27:18.597 --> 27:20.098
I've got people on it, but--

27:21.350 --> 27:22.351
Have you seen it?

27:22.351 --> 27:24.228
- Yes. Yes, I have.
- You have?

27:24.228 --> 27:25.812
- Yes.
- Can I see it?

27:32.361 --> 27:36.740
Oh, my God. How did they even get this?

27:36.740 --> 27:37.866
I have no idea.

27:37.866 --> 27:39.535
Fucking <i>Vault</i>.
They're the ones who outed Bradley.

27:39.535 --> 27:41.870
- They don't give a shit. Wow.
- Yeah.

27:42.454 --> 27:43.872
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

27:43.872 --> 27:46.416
Well, the way I see it,
there are two ways to handle this.

27:46.416 --> 27:49.711
- Okay.
- One is that we--

27:50.462 --> 27:55.092
we release a statement,
saying that we are...

27:57.970 --> 27:59.346
happy and...

28:02.182 --> 28:03.934
we're adults and we are...

28:08.897 --> 28:09.898
We can't do that.

28:10.399 --> 28:13.986
The board,
it will not exactly celebrate this.

28:14.820 --> 28:17.239
So, option two.

28:18.323 --> 28:20.909
Option two is money.
All these people want is money.

28:20.909 --> 28:24.580
So, we pay for it, we buy it, we kill it.
And this never happened.

28:24.580 --> 28:26.665
Yeah. It never happened.

28:28.959 --> 28:31.003
Okay. Never happened.

28:32.546 --> 28:33.380
Hi, Paul.

28:33.964 --> 28:35.007
Mia.

28:35.007 --> 28:36.258
- Alex.
- Yes.

28:36.925 --> 28:39.887
Alex. Pierpaolo needs a quick word
with you. Is that okay?

28:39.887 --> 28:42.556
- Will continue that with you later. Okay.
- We will. Of course, we'll talk.

28:46.185 --> 28:49.730
Look, of course
I'm thinking seriously about Paul's offer.

28:49.730 --> 28:54.860
So, let's go back at them on
a couple of deal points, but you're right,

28:54.860 --> 28:59.156
this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
I just need a little more time.

28:59.156 --> 29:01.700
- Was she expecting you?
- No, she's not.

29:01.700 --> 29:03.577
- Sue, I gotta go.
- I'm an old college friend.

29:03.577 --> 29:05.829
- I'm not sure where she's at.
- There she is.

29:06.580 --> 29:07.581
Surprise.

29:08.874 --> 29:10.501
Ms. Bak. She says she knows you.

29:10.501 --> 29:12.669
Yeah. It's fine. Sorry.

29:12.669 --> 29:14.004
Sure. No problem.

29:14.505 --> 29:17.216
Hey. Sorry, I guess I'm underdressed.

29:17.216 --> 29:19.885
Hey, Kate. How are you?

29:20.469 --> 29:23.388
Well, I just got fired. So, I'm great.

29:26.099 --> 29:27.142
Can we talk?

29:28.644 --> 29:30.938
I mean, I know you're busy.
It won't take long.

29:32.022 --> 29:34.107
Of course. Let's talk.

29:34.107 --> 29:37.277
So, what happened at Hyperion?

29:40.989 --> 29:41.990
Well...

29:44.952 --> 29:46.662
Paul and I had a...

29:48.455 --> 29:50.874
a philosophical disagreement.

29:53.418 --> 29:57.005
Been there for 12 years. You'd think
my opinion would mean something.

29:57.005 --> 30:00.759
And then I just walk in one day
and my badge stopped working.

30:03.428 --> 30:04.429
I called you.

30:04.972 --> 30:07.307
I know. I was gonna call you back.
There's just--

30:08.100 --> 30:09.518
There's been a lot going on.

30:09.518 --> 30:12.271
Yeah, that's the thing with the news,
right? There's more every day.

30:15.524 --> 30:17.943
I saw the promo for the interview.

30:17.943 --> 30:20.696
Yeah, you should watch it.
Alex didn't hold back.

30:22.531 --> 30:23.907
So, it's actually happening, huh?

30:24.700 --> 30:27.369
He's buying UBA? That's fucking crazy.

30:28.328 --> 30:32.124
Yeah. Well,
the DOJ still has to approve it.

30:32.124 --> 30:36.003
The shareholders have to vote.
So, you know, it's still a ways off.

30:37.880 --> 30:39.464
Stella, what did he offer you?

30:39.464 --> 30:40.549
What?

30:43.010 --> 30:45.429
Must be pretty fucking good
if you're running cover for him.

30:45.429 --> 30:47.472
I'm sorry, "running cover"?

30:49.308 --> 30:51.643
You should be investigating him.

30:51.643 --> 30:53.896
You should be looking
into what he's doing.

30:54.855 --> 30:56.732
But you're never gonna do that now,
are you?

30:56.732 --> 30:59.985
Our legal team has peeked
at every piece of paper, every asset.

30:59.985 --> 31:01.737
If there was anything to worry about--

31:01.737 --> 31:04.489
Jesus, Stella. Listen to yourself.

31:04.489 --> 31:07.492
The man just walks in here and makes
you do whatever the fuck he wants.

31:07.492 --> 31:12.539
This is how you are with him.
This is how you're always gonna be.

31:13.457 --> 31:16.418
He owns you.
You just can't fucking see it.

31:16.418 --> 31:20.130
He's down the hall right now.
Let's go talk to him.

31:22.299 --> 31:25.177
Sorry you lost your job. I really am.

31:25.177 --> 31:29.515
But you need to stop blaming
everybody else for all of your shit.

31:30.015 --> 31:32.392
There's nothing I can do for you.

31:34.394 --> 31:35.521
Right.

31:36.897 --> 31:40.234
I guess maybe you two do belong together.

31:40.234 --> 31:43.362
Maybe you should take over
the world together, you know?

31:43.362 --> 31:46.198
Who gives a shit if the rest of us
get fucked over in the process, right?

31:46.198 --> 31:47.282
Kate.

31:50.118 --> 31:51.328
You know that night...

31:53.455 --> 31:55.290
when you got your stomach pumped?

31:56.333 --> 31:58.377
I just sat in that waiting room.

31:59.795 --> 32:02.130
I kept thinking over and over and over,

32:02.130 --> 32:06.760
"Please don't let my best friend die.
Please just let her live.

32:08.428 --> 32:10.430
'Cause I just wanna go back to...

32:11.640 --> 32:13.892
us being in our dorm rooms
and playing video games

32:13.892 --> 32:15.811
and being stupid with each other."

32:18.021 --> 32:20.607
And then, after all that,
you just stopped talking to me.

32:21.441 --> 32:23.193
You even blew me off in Texas.

32:23.819 --> 32:27.865
So I don't have a fucking clue
why I'm still trying to help you.

32:29.491 --> 32:31.577
You will always choose him.

32:34.788 --> 32:35.789
Goodbye, Stella.

32:40.794 --> 32:42.337
Cory was so shy.

32:42.838 --> 32:44.923
He really had a hard time with other kids.

32:44.923 --> 32:47.467
And I had to remind him,
"You're smarter than they are.

32:47.467 --> 32:48.886
You're too smart for them.

32:49.595 --> 32:52.347
You're surrounded by kids
who will become insurance salesmen

32:52.347 --> 32:56.810
and accountants and middle management,
and you're not going to do that.

32:57.352 --> 33:00.772
You have my fire.
You're gonna scar the world."

33:01.523 --> 33:03.567
You know that phrase,
"The world is my oyster"?

33:03.567 --> 33:04.735
Shakespeare.

33:04.735 --> 33:08.864
People forget the second half is,
"Which I with sword will open."

33:09.364 --> 33:13.493
You have to open the oyster
of the world with a fucking sword.

33:14.661 --> 33:16.205
And you should have seen Cory.

33:16.830 --> 33:20.292
He took one of those light-up swords
and started smacking

33:20.292 --> 33:22.252
the bushes in our backyard

33:22.252 --> 33:28.717
and the next day, he walked into class
and he punched the first bully he saw,

33:28.717 --> 33:29.968
and he got suspended.

33:31.053 --> 33:33.472
We had to have a talk about strategy
after that.

33:34.139 --> 33:36.350
He has fire. He always has.

33:37.851 --> 33:40.938
Well, it's very clear
where he gets his superpowers from.

33:41.939 --> 33:44.274
You must be so proud
of everything he's done at UBA.

33:44.274 --> 33:45.359
I am.

33:46.026 --> 33:49.571
Cory, wasn't there something that
you wanted to talk to your mother about?

33:50.864 --> 33:51.865
What's that, dear?

33:54.993 --> 33:55.994
Right, yeah.

33:57.329 --> 33:59.248
I heard you made some calls for us
to the DOJ.

33:59.248 --> 34:00.791
Yes. Well,

34:01.583 --> 34:04.044
I still have some tricks up my sleeve.

34:04.628 --> 34:06.922
I'm having lunch with Ed Mundy this week.

34:06.922 --> 34:09.299
He's really the one
who greases the wheels.

34:09.299 --> 34:11.510
I didn't want to tell you
until I had good news.

34:11.510 --> 34:13.344
Wow. Well, thank you.

34:14.221 --> 34:19.184
I saw the headlines. It's not clean,
this deal. The optics are very tricky.

34:19.184 --> 34:23.897
Yeah, I so appreciate it, but you don't
need to use your connections for me.

34:23.897 --> 34:25.940
Why else do I keep up with these people?

34:25.940 --> 34:28.527
Well, right. Yes, of course.

34:28.527 --> 34:33.156
It's big tech swallowing up
a legacy media company.

34:33.156 --> 34:36.743
And Paul Marks,
with all those government contracts?

34:36.743 --> 34:39.413
Of course the DOJ is gonna scrutinize it.

34:39.413 --> 34:42.456
We just don't want there to be
any question of impropriety or undue

34:42.958 --> 34:43.792
influence.

34:43.792 --> 34:47.713
You know. And our attorneys,
they're all over it.

34:47.713 --> 34:49.172
We're gonna get the approval.

34:53.719 --> 34:56.889
Well,
I guess I'll cancel my lunch with Ed.

34:57.890 --> 34:59.433
Saves me a trip to DC.

35:00.017 --> 35:01.977
Yeah. Okay, good, thank you. I'm sorry.

35:03.103 --> 35:06.064
No, of course. I'm sorry.

35:06.064 --> 35:07.941
I hope I didn't mess anything up.

35:08.942 --> 35:10.068
You don't need my help.

35:10.068 --> 35:13.655
Not at all, Ma. I really appreciate it.

35:13.655 --> 35:16.033
Look at this table. What a mess.

35:16.533 --> 35:19.661
- Can I help with anything?
- No, no. I've got it, really.

35:22.915 --> 35:24.791
Should I just clear some of the...

35:41.058 --> 35:42.226
Let me do that, Mom.

35:42.226 --> 35:44.853
No, no, that's my job. I'm the hostess.

35:44.853 --> 35:46.313
Cory, please.

35:51.860 --> 35:53.737
I just wanted to see you, that's all.

35:55.447 --> 35:56.573
And I'm here, Mom.

35:58.909 --> 36:02.329
It's so interesting what happens
when women get older.

36:02.913 --> 36:05.582
We carry this wisdom, but no one cares.

36:06.708 --> 36:09.461
And we've survived
the death cult of capitalism,

36:09.461 --> 36:13.674
but, really, you just want us
to get out of the way, don't you?

36:14.216 --> 36:17.553
You want us to be silent,
quiet as the grave.

36:55.048 --> 37:00.137
<i>Remember the day I set you free?</i>

37:01.013 --> 37:06.143
<i>I told you, you could always
Count on me, darling</i>

37:06.727 --> 37:11.940
<i>And from that day on, I made a vow</i>

37:11.940 --> 37:16.236
<i>I'd be there when you want me
Someway, somehow</i>

37:17.946 --> 37:24.244
<i>'Cause, baby
There ain't no mountain high enough</i>

37:25.495 --> 37:30.000
<i>Ain't no valley low enough</i>

37:30.709 --> 37:35.380
<i>Ain't no river wide enough</i>

37:35.881 --> 37:39.301
<i>To keep me from getting to you</i>

37:40.344 --> 37:44.348
<i>No wind, no rain</i>

37:45.057 --> 37:47.768
<i>Or winter's cold</i>

37:48.644 --> 37:52.064
- <i>Can stop me, baby</i>
- <i>No, no, baby</i>

37:53.106 --> 37:56.318
- <i>'Cause you are my love</i>
- <i>If you're ever in trouble</i>

37:56.318 --> 37:58.445
<i>I'll be there on the double</i>

37:58.445 --> 38:00.322
- <i>Just</i>
- <i>Send for me</i>

38:00.322 --> 38:02.741
- <i>Oh, baby</i>
- <i>'Cause, baby</i>

38:02.741 --> 38:06.828
<i>There ain't
No mountain high enough</i>

38:07.579 --> 38:12.125
<i>Ain't no valley low enough</i>

38:12.125 --> 38:16.213
<i>Ain't no river wide enough</i>

38:16.213 --> 38:20.133
<i>To keep me from getting to you</i>

38:25.305 --> 38:27.307
Hey, you okay?

38:27.307 --> 38:30.060
- Did I do something?
- No, no, I'm fine.

38:30.060 --> 38:34.189
I was just thinking about my mom.
I wasn't there when she--

38:34.189 --> 38:36.733
Yeah. I'm sorry...

38:37.276 --> 38:41.947
and I was gonna call you when I--
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you.

38:41.947 --> 38:44.157
No, it's okay. You don't have to say that.

38:46.368 --> 38:50.289
He does. Because he's managing you.
That's what he does.

38:50.289 --> 38:52.958
- Mom.
- He's been doing it since you arrived.

38:52.958 --> 38:58.922
All this, the lobster, our little song,
it's all an act for him. It's not real.

39:00.716 --> 39:04.344
He's so good, though. Sometimes
it's hard to tell the difference.

39:05.345 --> 39:09.474
You should stay away from him.
He's alone because he should be alone.

39:09.474 --> 39:14.521
I know, because I have tried
and tried and tried with him.

39:16.773 --> 39:18.775
I want you to leave now.

39:33.582 --> 39:34.583
Families.

39:37.878 --> 39:38.879
Mom,

39:40.672 --> 39:43.592
you know I care about you,

39:44.218 --> 39:47.554
and you know I always will.

39:48.972 --> 39:52.017
You only came to see me
because you wanted something,

39:52.851 --> 39:55.687
and you won't come back
until you need something again.

39:56.438 --> 39:58.941
You really are just like your father.

39:59.441 --> 40:01.860
There's something very wrong with you.

40:04.071 --> 40:05.072
We should go.

40:07.491 --> 40:10.661
Don't worry, I won't call the DOJ for you.

40:25.217 --> 40:26.385
Are you okay?

40:30.264 --> 40:33.183
Did she say stuff like that to you
when you were a kid?

40:33.183 --> 40:34.476
She's been through a lot.

40:37.729 --> 40:38.730
It's hard.

40:41.358 --> 40:44.444
She's been on her own for so long.

40:48.240 --> 40:50.325
What she did,
no one really appreciates it.

40:54.538 --> 40:56.331
You know you're not a bad person, right?

40:57.124 --> 40:59.626
We really don't need to talk about it.
I'm fine, thanks.

41:01.420 --> 41:04.590
Well, we're friends. It's okay.
This is what friends talk about.

41:05.174 --> 41:08.927
We are two people who use each other,
Bradley. That's it.

41:13.307 --> 41:14.308
Wow.

41:16.101 --> 41:20.230
I don't believe that.
And I don't think you believe that either.

41:30.365 --> 41:34.661
Oh, my God.
There's been a Supreme Court brief leak.

41:36.205 --> 41:38.040
Oh, my God, they're overturning <i>Roe</i>.

41:40.417 --> 41:42.920
Gayle needs to know if we have
the go-ahead to break into prime time

41:42.920 --> 41:44.421
to report on this leak.

41:44.421 --> 41:45.631
- Is that okay? Okay.
- Yeah.

41:51.470 --> 41:54.056
- You're not gonna even believe this.
- They're overturning <i>Roe</i>.

41:54.681 --> 41:56.642
I can't understand this.

41:56.642 --> 41:59.770
What? That ruling isn't until June.

41:59.770 --> 42:03.190
It's a leaked Supreme Court brief.
Politico just posted it.

42:04.233 --> 42:05.234
You think it's real?

42:05.234 --> 42:07.361
Well, Alito writing for the majority.

42:07.361 --> 42:12.741
Amy Coney Barrett saying something about
"domestic adoption needs" being met,

42:12.741 --> 42:14.201
which doesn't sound creepy at all.

42:14.201 --> 42:16.870
And they're quoting medieval law
to justify this shit.

42:16.870 --> 42:19.331
I'm gonna clear tomorrow's show.
Look for a new lineup in a few hours.

42:19.331 --> 42:21.083
I'm going home, and I'm gonna get to work.

42:21.083 --> 42:23.210
Okay. Can you believe this?

42:25.337 --> 42:28.006
- What do you want me to say?
- That you fucking handled it.

42:28.006 --> 42:31.885
I offered to buy it. I threatened to sue.
They're not budging.

42:31.885 --> 42:33.554
Then buy the company,
shut the whole thing down.

42:33.554 --> 42:34.972
You really want that out in the world?

42:34.972 --> 42:38.934
That you bought some gossip rag
to bury a photo?

42:38.934 --> 42:40.519
You fucked up.

42:40.519 --> 42:43.438
The pretty girl smiled,
and you let your guard down.

42:43.438 --> 42:47.609
Right. So, that's it? That's all you got?
I pay you to fix things.

42:47.609 --> 42:50.279
You pay me to tell you the truth.

42:51.488 --> 42:54.157
Pull your pants up,
and get your fucking head straight.

43:03.625 --> 43:06.336
We went to St. Barts
and I brought the wrong color bikini.

43:06.336 --> 43:09.131
- I hate it when that happens.
- Blue is not my color.

43:09.131 --> 43:11.175
Did you see her dress?

43:11.175 --> 43:12.759
She looked absolutely gorgeous.

43:12.759 --> 43:15.470
We have to fly commercial.
I'm sorry. You all right with that?

43:16.638 --> 43:18.182
- Play it by ear.
- Okay. Yeah.

43:18.182 --> 43:20.100
What am I even doing here?

43:20.767 --> 43:22.311
What the fucking fuck?

43:28.442 --> 43:29.693
They're overturning <i>Roe</i>.

43:29.693 --> 43:31.111
Who?

43:32.112 --> 43:34.406
<i>Roe</i>. Abortion rights.

43:35.365 --> 43:36.200
Wow.

43:36.200 --> 43:39.369
My body, my choice.

43:39.369 --> 43:41.663
At least we're in New York. We'll be okay.

43:42.289 --> 43:43.290
That's your take. Really?

43:43.290 --> 43:45.918
Women are gonna die of ectopic pregnancies

43:45.918 --> 43:48.545
while doctors get sued
trying to save lives.

43:48.545 --> 43:52.549
Rape victims will be forced
to carry their assailant's child

43:52.549 --> 43:54.551
and the maternal mortality rate
will skyrocket.

43:55.093 --> 43:59.348
Mostly for women of color because
that is how shit rolls in this country!

44:01.642 --> 44:03.769
Jesus. Get me out of here.

44:03.769 --> 44:07.481
- I know, right?
- What the fuck is her problem?

44:07.481 --> 44:08.774
Triggered much?

44:13.904 --> 44:16.198
What is that? Why is she mad?

44:34.299 --> 44:35.884
No idea who leaked the draft.

44:35.884 --> 44:38.929
Roberts hasn't put out a statement.
They think it'll come tomorrow morning.

44:39.638 --> 44:40.472
Got it.

44:40.472 --> 44:42.641
- The crew's waiting for you.
- All right, let's do it.

44:43.642 --> 44:46.395
<i>In a leaked draft
labeled "Opinion of the Court,"</i>

44:46.395 --> 44:49.064
<i>Justice Samuel Alito writes that, quote,</i>

44:49.648 --> 44:53.110
<i>"We hold that</i> Roe <i>and Casey
must be overruled."</i>

44:53.819 --> 44:56.238
Hi. Do you have a minute?

44:56.238 --> 44:57.823
For you? Always. Come in.

44:57.823 --> 45:00.158
<i>...to the people's elected representatives.</i>

45:01.368 --> 45:05.247
It's crazy about this SCOTUS leak.
I guess it was legit.

45:05.747 --> 45:09.209
Yeah, sounds like it.
Women are gonna be glued to the news.

45:09.209 --> 45:11.670
It's a funny thing about misogyny,
it's always good for business.

45:11.670 --> 45:12.880
Why is that?

45:12.880 --> 45:16.300
Chris posted something.
It's gonna get complicated.

45:16.300 --> 45:18.093
I saw that.
I'm gonna have a word with her.

45:18.760 --> 45:20.679
Who decided a button wasn't good enough?

45:21.305 --> 45:25.893
A button does the job.
But no, there has to be jewelry involved.

45:25.893 --> 45:30.230
<i>...federal constitutional
protection of abortion rights.</i>

45:31.940 --> 45:33.066
There's one more thing.

45:33.066 --> 45:34.902
Can it fucking wait a second?

45:36.653 --> 45:38.322
No, no, I can do it.

45:38.322 --> 45:39.823
<i>After President Donald Trump</i>

45:39.823 --> 45:42.492
<i>has appointed Neil Gorsuch,
Brett Kavanaugh</i>

45:42.492 --> 45:44.077
<i>and Amy Coney Barrett.</i>

45:45.412 --> 45:46.580
Stand still.

45:47.247 --> 45:50.042
<i>...overturned landmark decisions
of this magnitude.</i>

45:50.042 --> 45:55.088
<i>The last time being the</i> Brown
<i>vs</i> Board of Education <i>ruling in 1954.</i>

45:55.672 --> 45:59.968
Do you ever get tired of this place?
Putting out all the fires?

46:01.053 --> 46:05.891
No, I fucking love it. When I sleep,
I dream of being at the office.

46:16.068 --> 46:17.819
Stella, what?

46:20.822 --> 46:23.825
After the deal goes through,
Paul's gonna push you out.

46:24.826 --> 46:26.370
He offered me your job.

46:30.207 --> 46:33.168
This day, it is full of surprises.

46:45.722 --> 46:46.974
What did you tell him?

46:46.974 --> 46:48.684
I haven't told him anything yet,

46:49.476 --> 46:52.980
but there is an employment agreement
sitting on my desk

46:52.980 --> 46:55.274
that Amanda is waiting for me to sign.

46:57.901 --> 46:58.902
Well, you should sign it.

47:00.070 --> 47:00.904
What?

47:00.904 --> 47:03.574
If he came to you
with an offer behind my back,

47:03.574 --> 47:06.493
it's because he thinks
he can manipulate you.

47:07.244 --> 47:09.496
Let's let him think that.

47:10.122 --> 47:13.750
It won't be the first time
you were underestimated around here.

47:17.754 --> 47:19.464
And what happens after I sign it?

47:19.464 --> 47:21.216
I don't know, keep an eye on him.

47:23.177 --> 47:24.469
Build some trust.

47:25.179 --> 47:28.807
And then we see how it plays out.

47:35.689 --> 47:36.899
I should get back to it.

47:38.901 --> 47:40.444
It's gonna be a crazy week.

48:02.674 --> 48:05.302
I've been looking for you.
Apparently, you were out all day.

48:05.302 --> 48:06.261
Leonard.

48:06.261 --> 48:08.972
- Have you handled your little problem?
- Excuse me?

48:08.972 --> 48:14.478
I'm still getting calls from board members
regarding this DOJ fiasco.

48:15.145 --> 48:18.398
They should be hearing directly from you.

48:18.398 --> 48:21.860
Not everyone is tucked in
on this deal, Cory.

48:21.860 --> 48:24.988
You need to give them assurances
that you've got it all in hand.

48:24.988 --> 48:26.740
Let's not talk about what I need to do.

48:26.740 --> 48:30.285
Here's what you need to do.
Get off my back.

48:31.537 --> 48:34.623
You're a little out of line tonight.

48:35.457 --> 48:37.876
Dear Martha did quite a job on you,
didn't she?

48:37.876 --> 48:43.590
Hey, I did my job.
Your job is to placate the board.

48:43.590 --> 48:45.217
That's the reason I picked you.

48:46.218 --> 48:47.219
I'm sorry?

48:47.719 --> 48:49.638
Oh, God. Apparently,
I need to repeat myself.

48:49.638 --> 48:53.559
Get the board in line, right behind me.

48:53.559 --> 48:57.980
It sounds like we need
to clarify just what your job is.

48:57.980 --> 48:59.773
I won the fucking war with Cybil.

48:59.773 --> 49:02.317
I choose to share the spoils with you,

49:02.317 --> 49:05.988
but I have no problem moving you
out of play if that's what's required.

49:05.988 --> 49:08.824
What the hell is wrong with you?

49:08.824 --> 49:11.827
All I'm saying, Leonard,
is history can repeat itself.

49:12.995 --> 49:16.164
Fred and Cybil didn't get the memo,
and their heads are on pikes

49:16.164 --> 49:18.584
in the armoire in my office
where I keep my extra shirts.

49:20.002 --> 49:25.090
In the meantime, I'm heading downstairs
to the party to have a canapé or two.

49:25.716 --> 49:27.050
Why don't you take the stairs?

49:31.763 --> 49:32.639
Okay.

49:38.562 --> 49:39.563
Oh, my God.

49:40.439 --> 49:41.523
- Fuck.
- Hey, hey.

49:42.316 --> 49:43.567
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:43.567 --> 49:45.235
Guess you're gonna miss
the after-party, huh?

49:45.736 --> 49:47.112
That after-party is so over.

49:47.613 --> 49:52.075
It's back to coat hangers and dark alleys,
my friend. Can you fucking believe this?

49:52.075 --> 49:53.702
- What the fuck, man?
- I don't know.

49:53.702 --> 49:55.162
Look, I'm gonna sit with the editors,

49:55.162 --> 49:57.206
work up a video,
history of the court on abortion.

49:57.206 --> 49:59.208
I say we run it first thing
tomorrow morning, yeah?

49:59.208 --> 50:03.253
And can you please pull
the clip from RBG's confirmation hearing?

50:03.253 --> 50:05.964
- It is essential that women be--
- That women be the decision-maker.

50:05.964 --> 50:08.634
Yes. I already pulled the clip.
I already sent it to him.

50:09.468 --> 50:10.469
'Course you did.

50:11.011 --> 50:13.096
I've been reading your mind for 20 years.
It's like my superpower.

50:16.058 --> 50:17.643
Oh, gosh.

50:17.643 --> 50:19.811
- You know what I totally forgot?
- What?

50:19.811 --> 50:22.689
The original decision in '73--
That was leaked too, remember that?

50:22.689 --> 50:25.567
The highest court in the land--
They can't even keep a secret?

50:25.567 --> 50:27.486
- I know.
- Well, it's all in there.

50:27.486 --> 50:29.571
- So, call me if you need anything.
- Great Thank you.

50:29.571 --> 50:32.324
Yeah. Maybe just a red robe, and a bonnet.

50:32.324 --> 50:33.742
Maybe we change your name to "of Chip."

50:35.661 --> 50:37.329
- Too soon?
- I think a little.

50:46.255 --> 50:47.422
Hey,

50:47.422 --> 50:50.175
- I just heard the news.
- It's insane.

50:50.175 --> 50:53.512
Yeah. So much
for Kavanaugh calling <i>Roe</i> settled law.

50:53.512 --> 50:56.849
I mean, we knew this was coming,
but can you believe this shit?

50:56.849 --> 51:00.811
This is the world that Lizzy
and her generation get to grow up in.

51:00.811 --> 51:03.105
- It's so--
- Look, I know you're slammed,

51:03.105 --> 51:04.606
but we should probably talk
about this photo.

51:04.606 --> 51:06.441
Well, let's just do it
when we get home, okay?

51:06.441 --> 51:08.235
I just have a few things to do here,

51:08.235 --> 51:10.028
and then--
but I'll meet you right back there--

51:10.028 --> 51:11.280
- Yeah, I can't.
- Right--

51:11.280 --> 51:12.614
I gotta be on a plane in a few hours.

51:12.614 --> 51:13.991
- Texas, the engine test--
- No.

51:13.991 --> 51:15.242
That's right.

51:16.743 --> 51:18.328
Oh, gosh,
this is all happening really fast.

51:18.328 --> 51:21.081
Yeah. The timing couldn't be worse.

51:22.457 --> 51:26.795
All right, well, when you get back,
maybe we can have another lost weekend.

51:29.548 --> 51:31.049
I want more than a weekend.

51:38.807 --> 51:39.892
Hey, Mia. What do you need?

51:39.892 --> 51:43.687
<i>Hey, can you ask Alex
if she wants to anchor from DC tomorrow?</i>

51:43.687 --> 51:44.980
<i>I can get her on a plane.</i>

51:46.273 --> 51:49.401
Yeah. Just give me one second.
I'll call you right back.
