WEBVTT

00:02.252 --> 00:06.339
[Jughead] Our old pal
turned superstar, Josie McCoy,
had come and gone.

00:07.799 --> 00:09.676
Leaving us all
to our haunted existences.

00:11.177 --> 00:14.889
No one more so,
than Archie Andrews.

00:14.931 --> 00:20.437
The guilt over the deaths
of his platoon members hanging
on him like a shroud.

00:20.478 --> 00:26.192
Veronica Lodge was also being
haunted, by a flesh and blood
mistake from her past.

00:26.234 --> 00:28.403
[video call ringing]

00:28.445 --> 00:29.863
[Veronica sighs]

00:29.904 --> 00:32.365
-What, Chad?
-I have some great news.

00:32.407 --> 00:35.952
I'm going to be able to pay
back all the funds I "borrowed"
in one fell swoop.

00:35.994 --> 00:39.164
I've been working on a little
something-something quietly,

00:39.205 --> 00:42.959
but it's about to go public
and with that comes
a big payday.

00:43.001 --> 00:46.171
[scoffs]
Considering you always
screw things up,

00:46.212 --> 00:47.505
no, Chad.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.299
I don't want or need your help.

00:49.340 --> 00:51.551
Besides, at the rate
Pearls and Posh is going,

00:51.593 --> 00:54.471
I'll have all of our investors'
accounts restored in a month.

00:54.512 --> 00:57.682
At which point,
I'll divorce your ass so fast,
your head will spin.

00:58.475 --> 00:59.517
Goodbye, Chad.

01:01.311 --> 01:05.315
Brothers and sisters,
thank you for joining us today.

01:05.356 --> 01:08.443
To conclude, Brother Kevin
and I will be performing
a medley

01:08.485 --> 01:13.323
from the iconic musical,
Joseph and the Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat.

01:14.741 --> 01:15.658
Stop!

01:17.827 --> 01:19.287
I've just had...

01:20.455 --> 01:21.623
a revelation.

01:21.664 --> 01:22.540
Okay?

01:24.876 --> 01:26.586
Jason himself commands it.

01:27.545 --> 01:29.089
No more singing.

01:29.964 --> 01:32.175
Really?

01:32.217 --> 01:35.428
As you know, he was
a young man of few words.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.227
Hi, my name is Jughead Jones.

01:43.144 --> 01:45.355
And I am seven days sober.

01:45.396 --> 01:47.690
[all clapping]

01:47.732 --> 01:49.901
I'm ready to start
my apology tour.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.152
[knocking on door]

01:54.906 --> 01:56.950
-Hey, Alice.
-Hey, Jughead.

01:58.535 --> 02:01.412
Betty's not here.

02:01.454 --> 02:05.959
She's working
the Lonely Highway,
doing God-knows-what.

02:12.882 --> 02:14.968
Yeah, that's okay.
Will you just tell her
I stopped by?

02:15.635 --> 02:16.511
Sure.

02:18.930 --> 02:21.975
[TV announcer
speaking indistinctly]

02:22.016 --> 02:26.062
You guys seen this crap?
Front page of today's
Brave and True.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.273
General Taylor is
retiring with full honors,

02:28.314 --> 02:30.525
and a 21-gun farewell salute.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.777
Doesn't that burn you after
the crap that he pulled?

02:32.819 --> 02:34.696
I thought you said
Taylor was under investigation.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.781
He was.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.242
A reporter from the Times
was looking into some
dirty missions

02:39.284 --> 02:41.911
the General orchestrated.
Like ours, Eric.

02:41.953 --> 02:45.707
So I called her. And apparently
her editor killed the story,
not enough evidence, she said.

02:45.748 --> 02:47.959
Maybe take that
as a sign, Sarge.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.335
Let it go. Move on.

02:50.879 --> 02:51.754
Like hell.

02:56.467 --> 02:58.678
[Weatherbee]
You missed weeks
of work, Mr. Jones.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.221
You didn't even arrange
for a substitute.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.390
I know. I'm sorry, Waldo.

03:02.432 --> 03:03.391
I really am. I...

03:05.018 --> 03:08.730
was going through some
really intense personal stuff.

03:08.771 --> 03:11.399
Look I'm just trying to get
my life back together.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.861
And when you do,
maybe we can have
you teach again.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.530
But right now,
consider yourself on
administrative leave.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.951
[phone ringing]

03:24.621 --> 03:26.039
Pearls and Posh,
this is Lodge.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.999
Ms. Lodge?
This is Diane Nelson.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.585
I'm an agent with the SEC.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.129
We'd like to schedule
a time to come in and review
your books and finances.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.465
Oh, why is that?

03:35.506 --> 03:38.218
To ensure that Pearls and Posh
is not engaged in any
financial malfeasance.

03:38.259 --> 03:39.469
Can we plan on tomorrow?

03:39.510 --> 03:43.598
Uh, ooh...
I'm travelling tomorrow.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.516
Can we try top of next week?

03:45.558 --> 03:48.811
Sure, top of next week is good.
I'll follow up with an email.

03:48.853 --> 03:50.021
Great. See you then.

03:53.316 --> 03:58.696
The SEC wants to look
at our books, which are...

03:58.738 --> 04:02.075
-Not yet kosher.
-Yes.

04:02.116 --> 04:04.327
It had to have been Chad
who tipped them off.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.287
Wouldn't he be torpedoing
himself, too?

04:06.329 --> 04:09.749
What he wants is for me
to ask for his help,

04:09.791 --> 04:12.752
so he can balance our books
before the SEC reviews them.

04:12.794 --> 04:15.255
But I'd rather go to
white-collar jail than do that.

04:15.296 --> 04:18.716
What we need
is an influx of cash.

04:18.758 --> 04:21.427
My mind turns to...
[snaps fingers]

04:21.469 --> 04:24.639
-My father.
-What? Like a short-term loan?

04:24.681 --> 04:26.474
Remember those
escaped prisoners,

04:26.516 --> 04:28.893
who were convinced my father
had a stash of palladium?

04:28.935 --> 04:31.396
-Mmm-hmm.
-If we got our hands
on that,

04:31.437 --> 04:34.649
we could sell it
and finish repaying
what Chad stole in my name.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.985
If it was in his safe,
he would've moved it.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.861
But...

04:38.903 --> 04:40.822
I have an idea who
might know where.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.701
Your old man's been in touch
with Hermosa.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.162
She's still in deep with him.

04:48.204 --> 04:49.247
I'll call her.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.623
Actually, uh...

04:51.749 --> 04:53.584
Let me.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.461
While you were at Barnard...

04:56.629 --> 04:57.839
we...

04:58.548 --> 05:01.968
had a... thing.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.219
What kind of thing?

05:03.261 --> 05:05.179
[chuckles]
You know what kind.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.599
You know what kind. Okay.

05:09.976 --> 05:10.852
[line ringing]

05:12.186 --> 05:13.521
Hey, baby.

05:13.563 --> 05:14.939
Long time, no talk.

05:15.481 --> 05:16.774
Yeah.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.568
[whispers] I miss you so much.

05:21.821 --> 05:24.324
Why does my demon
of a mother always have
to rain on my parade?

05:24.365 --> 05:26.284
You're young, beautiful
and a star.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.161
And she isn't.

05:28.202 --> 05:31.622
Which is why you need to prove,
beyond a shadow of a doubt,

05:31.664 --> 05:36.044
that there is no
higher authority than you
within this ministry.

05:36.085 --> 05:38.338
You're not wrong.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.965
So how do we put Mumsie
in the shade?

05:41.007 --> 05:42.300
Forever.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.094
It's all about
showmanship, Cheryl.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.055
You need to upstage
your mother.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.557
Little-known fact,

05:50.558 --> 05:52.060
if you perform three miracles,

05:53.269 --> 05:55.271
you qualify for sainthood.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.899
Being canonized has always
been one of my life goals.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.568
Go on.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.653
In junior high, I was obsessed
with David Copperfield.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.990
The magician, so...

06:06.032 --> 06:09.202
let's just say, I may have
a trick or two up my sleeve.

06:09.243 --> 06:11.954
Oh, I hope you have
at least three,
Brother Kevin.

06:13.164 --> 06:15.166
I need my halo and my wings.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.503
That was some call, Reggie.

06:18.544 --> 06:19.796
How's Hermosa doing?

06:20.713 --> 06:22.924
A better question...

06:22.965 --> 06:27.428
Did she, just tell me,
where the palladium is?

06:27.470 --> 06:28.805
[whispers]
The answer is yes.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.521
You're carrying
a heavy weight, Archie.

06:38.773 --> 06:41.651
And it's not going to get
any lighter unless you share
the burden, so...

06:43.152 --> 06:44.737
What happened over there?

06:44.779 --> 06:45.655
You ready to tell me?

06:47.031 --> 06:48.533
[bomb exploding in distance]

06:48.574 --> 06:49.450
[Archie breathing heavily]

06:50.326 --> 06:52.537
[crashing]

06:55.498 --> 06:57.583
We were ordered into
a fire zone

06:57.625 --> 06:59.752
to deliver medical supplies
to civilians.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.380
But that mission was just
a cover-up.

07:02.422 --> 07:07.427
General Taylor was determined
to take down a warlord
controlling that region.

07:07.468 --> 07:09.846
A chance to get that final star
on his uniform.

07:09.887 --> 07:13.599
When he gave me the order,
I pushed back.

07:13.641 --> 07:16.978
I told him we weren't
a strike-force

07:17.019 --> 07:18.855
and that it was
a suicide mission.

07:18.896 --> 07:22.483
Taylor didn't back down,
so I caved.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.819
And, sure enough, we were lambs
to the slaughter.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.113
My platoon got caught
in some trenches.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.533
We needed air support.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.243
We couldn't get any signal.
Someone needed to reach
higher ground.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.912
So I told my men
that I would go.

07:34.954 --> 07:38.833
I thought that I was
protecting them because
I was taking the risk.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.042
But when I got back...

07:40.084 --> 07:40.960
[bomb exploding]

07:43.838 --> 07:44.714
[guns firing]

07:47.592 --> 07:48.718
Everyone was dead.

07:51.387 --> 07:52.263
[gunfire continues]

07:57.059 --> 07:58.186
Except Bingo.

08:01.355 --> 08:05.234
Who died before
the choppers reached us
and Eric lost his leg.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.445
And now Taylor's walking
away with honors.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.532
That's not right.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.450
[bomb explodes in distance]

08:14.869 --> 08:16.412
That's not right, Uncle Frank.

08:16.454 --> 08:17.830
[Frank] I know, it's not.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.373
But the Army's just gonna...

08:19.415 --> 08:21.167
circle the wagons
around the General.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.711
I wish I could tell you this
was a war you could win.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.589
But I just don't know
that it is.

08:26.631 --> 08:27.798
Yeah, maybe not.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.178
But it's a war worth fighting.

08:34.013 --> 08:37.642
I'm going to do everything
that I can to take Taylor down.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.238
[Reggie] Lucky your father
didn't change all the security
codes after he fired me.

08:50.279 --> 08:53.074
[Veronica] Lucky he doesn't
keep his palladium
in a vault in a bank.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.504
Jackpot.

09:10.132 --> 09:12.843
We have to give Hermosa a cut
of whatever we make.

09:12.885 --> 09:16.138
But if we can sell
the palladium off-market,

09:16.180 --> 09:18.599
our profit should be enough
to fill in where we're short.

09:18.641 --> 09:21.018
Question is, how do we sell it?

09:21.060 --> 09:23.229
Well, first...

09:23.271 --> 09:26.524
We have to smelt the palladium
into something new
and unrecognizable.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.527
I'm thinking Spanish doubloons.

09:29.569 --> 09:33.072
Then I'll host an auction,
but for that to work,

09:33.114 --> 09:36.576
there's one more person we need
to bring in on our scheming.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.369
[Veronica]
What do you think, Cheryl?

09:38.411 --> 09:41.914
I think one can never have
too many spider brooches.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.833
So, yes,
I'll help you, Veronica.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.876
Perfect.

09:45.918 --> 09:50.298
As I said,
I'm hosting an exclusive,
by-invitation-only auction.

09:50.339 --> 09:54.135
The centerpiece of which will
be some palladium doubloons,
I've acquired.

09:54.176 --> 09:57.388
Some of my guests
have been asking about
the palladium's origins

09:57.430 --> 09:59.348
and I wanna say that it came
from your mines.

09:59.390 --> 10:02.059
Not a problem. I'm always happy
to let you name-drop my family,

10:02.101 --> 10:04.270
in order to screw over
your father.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.814
Now, if that's all.
I'll be on my merry way.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.066
Kevin and I are performing
our first miracle today.

10:13.696 --> 10:14.572
[cell phone vibrating]

10:17.783 --> 10:19.452
-Hey, Samm.
-Finally!

10:19.493 --> 10:21.037
You've been ducking
my calls for days.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.872
Yeah, I know,
sorry I've been...

10:22.913 --> 10:24.498
[Samm] Save your excuses.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.959
The publisher is demanding
your manuscript ASAP.

10:27.001 --> 10:29.253
If you don't deliver,

10:29.295 --> 10:32.673
you will be
blackballed, you understand?
Your career will be over. Over.

10:32.715 --> 10:36.218
I have pages, I'll send them
to you by the end of the day,
I promise.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.429
This is
your last chance, kiddo.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.972
Okay? Don't disappoint me.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.520
[sighs]

10:48.939 --> 10:50.733
[Jughead] Hey, so...

10:50.775 --> 10:54.403
Before you say anything else.
I just... I wanna apologize.

10:54.445 --> 10:58.866
I promised to keep an eye
on you while you were tripping
and the moment things got weird

10:58.908 --> 10:59.784
I just...

11:00.618 --> 11:01.661
I abandoned you.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.704
You didn't do anything wrong.

11:03.746 --> 11:06.582
I never should've even
put you in that position.

11:06.624 --> 11:09.293
And I'm sorry.

11:09.335 --> 11:12.213
I'm so sorry that I dropped
off the face of the earth,

11:12.254 --> 11:15.549
and that I made you worry.
I'm just sorry
for everything, really.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.343
It's okay.

11:18.302 --> 11:19.470
I forgive you.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.640
Great, so...

11:23.891 --> 11:26.894
Not to relive that
horrible night.

11:28.145 --> 11:30.815
But, I dimly recall

11:30.856 --> 11:33.275
writing something
that resembled a novel,

11:33.317 --> 11:35.653
before I yanked my hand
out of the handcuffs.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.239
Jughead, you did write
your book that night.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.116
-I did?
-Mmm-hmm.

11:40.157 --> 11:43.285
-Well, that's great.
Do you know where it is?
-Yeah, um...

11:43.327 --> 11:47.581
Betty, gave it to Jessica
when she asked for it.

11:50.751 --> 11:51.627
Wh...

11:52.461 --> 11:54.004
But why would Betty...

11:54.046 --> 11:56.507
-Why would she do that?
-Jess was trying to heal.

11:56.549 --> 12:00.845
And move on with her life.
So, it seemed like the
right thing to do at the time.

12:00.886 --> 12:01.929
Wow, okay.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.390
I'm really, really sorry.

12:04.432 --> 12:08.477
But, Jughead, your sobriety
is what's most important
right now.

12:08.519 --> 12:12.064
I don't think that you should
reach out to Jessica. I think
that could be triggering.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.983
And if writing is going
to stress you out,

12:14.024 --> 12:17.153
then maybe
you should ask your agent
for another extension.

12:17.194 --> 12:20.573
I don't have any more
time, Tabitha.

12:20.614 --> 12:22.408
I either write
something new or...

12:23.367 --> 12:24.910
I'm not a writer anymore.

12:24.952 --> 12:27.079
If I ever was.

12:27.121 --> 12:29.415
[Cheryl] Instead of
my usual homily...

12:29.457 --> 12:33.002
I thought today,
we might all benefit
from a demonstration

12:33.043 --> 12:37.757
of my absolute authority
in this ministry.

12:37.798 --> 12:41.385
To that end,
as Jesus once
changed water...

12:42.428 --> 12:43.971
into wine,

12:45.598 --> 12:51.854
Jason has granted me
the ability to turn water...

12:51.896 --> 12:52.772
into...

12:54.774 --> 12:55.691
[Kevin gasps]

12:55.733 --> 12:57.526
Maple syrup.

12:57.568 --> 13:00.946
[all applauding]

13:03.949 --> 13:05.493
The nectar of the gods.

13:06.660 --> 13:07.536
Truly.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.374
General Taylor.

13:12.416 --> 13:14.752
Sergeant Andrews.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.213
I take it you're not here
to congratulate me.

13:17.254 --> 13:18.506
No, sir.

13:18.547 --> 13:19.965
We both know
the truth, General.

13:20.007 --> 13:22.885
You sent me and my men
into a war zone

13:22.927 --> 13:25.012
without adequate
support or intel.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.931
And because
of your recklessness,

13:26.972 --> 13:29.183
good men died.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.393
You're dishonoring the military
by pretending to be
some kind of hero.

13:31.435 --> 13:33.312
So...

13:33.354 --> 13:35.147
I'm asking you,
soldier to soldier,

13:36.607 --> 13:38.901
to stand down
and retire quietly.

13:39.735 --> 13:42.404
"Soldier to soldier"?

13:42.446 --> 13:44.657
You're just a kid
from some podunk town

13:44.698 --> 13:47.326
who joined the military
on a whim.

13:47.368 --> 13:50.496
You might as well have gone
backpacking through Europe.

13:50.538 --> 13:53.666
You don't understand
the Army or how it works
and you certainly

13:53.707 --> 13:56.752
don't know what it means
to be a real soldier.

13:56.794 --> 13:59.255
Don't cross me.
You will regret it.

14:01.131 --> 14:02.716
My men...

14:02.758 --> 14:04.802
paid for your order,
with blood.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.097
If you don't step down,
General.

14:08.138 --> 14:10.307
I'll demand
a military tribunal.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.226
And I'll tell them everything.

14:12.268 --> 14:15.646
Then I'll be forced
to put forth my version
of events.

14:15.688 --> 14:19.608
Highlighting how you,
Sergeant Andrews, went rogue

14:19.650 --> 14:22.570
and led your platoon
directly into an ambush.

14:22.611 --> 14:25.364
There is no paper trail
to support your claim.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.868
So, as I said before,

14:28.909 --> 14:31.078
it's my word against yours.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.164
Pursue this

14:34.206 --> 14:35.624
and you'll be a traitor.

14:35.666 --> 14:36.542
No.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.047
You're the traitor, General.

14:42.089 --> 14:44.216
I buried good men
because of you.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.051
I won't bury the truth
any longer.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.430
Regardless of the consequences.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.395
Taylor left us no choice.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.105
He won't back down, so we need
to step up and take him out.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.399
I don't know, Sarge.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.693
The trial would reopen
a lot of wounds.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.029
Especially for the families
of those other guys.

15:05.070 --> 15:08.240
We have to think about them
and what they would
want us to do.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.289
So let's say this...

15:16.415 --> 15:18.417
I won't go after the General,

15:18.459 --> 15:20.753
unless I have
the support and approval
of our platoon's families.

15:21.879 --> 15:22.755
How does that sound?

15:34.683 --> 15:36.644
Would you mind
reading my novel?

15:36.685 --> 15:39.396
And if you like it,
maybe you could
give it to your agent.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.883
[woman] My son trusted you.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.760
And you didn't protect him.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.388
And now you expect us
to go through a...

16:12.429 --> 16:14.473
A trial?

16:14.515 --> 16:16.350
To relive his death
all over again?

16:16.392 --> 16:19.687
Ma'am, I know
what Travis stood for.

16:19.728 --> 16:21.230
What he believed in.

16:21.271 --> 16:23.899
He fought for ideals
like truth and justice.

16:23.941 --> 16:26.193
For betterment
and human dignity.

16:28.112 --> 16:30.072
He sacrificed his life
for those things.

16:30.906 --> 16:32.032
Let me ask you...

16:33.826 --> 16:35.744
do you sleep soundly
at night, Sergeant?

16:35.786 --> 16:39.164
Because I don't.
Not since the moment...

16:40.249 --> 16:42.543
I received that folded-up flag.

16:42.584 --> 16:44.253
Know why?

16:44.294 --> 16:46.422
Because you were supposed
to bring my Travis back to me.

16:49.758 --> 16:51.427
And now, for the main event.

16:51.468 --> 16:55.556
A collection of doubloons
smelted from grade A palladium

16:55.597 --> 16:57.224
excavated from
the Blossom mines.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.562
With that in mind,
let's begin at...

17:01.603 --> 17:03.981
$150,000 to the gentleman
in the fedora.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.315
Do I have 170?

17:05.357 --> 17:08.152
170? No, 180?

17:08.193 --> 17:10.988
No, $190,000
to the madam in the front row.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.364
Shall we go to two?

17:12.406 --> 17:15.325
$200,000 to Mr. Sand.
Do I have 225?

17:15.367 --> 17:17.077
Do I have 250?

17:17.119 --> 17:18.912
250! 275?

17:20.122 --> 17:21.957
290, against you, Mr. Sand.

17:21.999 --> 17:26.253
Three hundred. That's $300,000
for these precious doubloons.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.006
Going once, going twice, sold!

17:29.048 --> 17:32.092
To Mr. Sand for $300,000!

17:32.134 --> 17:34.178
[all applauding]

17:34.219 --> 17:37.014
What a coup
for such rare wonders.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.849
[all applauding]

17:40.517 --> 17:41.393
[slow claps]

17:42.519 --> 17:43.395
Excuse me.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.316
You know, it's almost as if

17:47.357 --> 17:50.402
you wanted to sell those
doubloons to Mr. Sand for less,

17:50.444 --> 17:52.446
just so I wouldn't get
the palladium.

17:52.488 --> 17:55.991
But that would be so petty
and ridiculous of you,
wouldn't it?

17:56.033 --> 17:58.494
In fact, that's exactly
what I did, Daddy.

17:58.535 --> 17:59.995
Next time,

18:00.037 --> 18:01.246
don't crash my auction.

18:07.586 --> 18:10.881
You know, I never wanted Jim
to join the Army.

18:10.923 --> 18:14.593
I was afraid that
he wouldn't even make it
through basic training.

18:14.635 --> 18:18.680
But he really believed that
he had a duty to protect
and serve his country

18:18.722 --> 18:20.808
and that there was
no greater honor than that.

18:20.849 --> 18:23.352
There isn't. No.

18:23.393 --> 18:24.812
And Jim knew what
he was fighting for.

18:26.146 --> 18:27.856
I remember, I was...

18:28.732 --> 18:31.110
incredibly relieved...

18:31.151 --> 18:33.570
when he started sending
me letters about you,
Sergeant Andrews.

18:35.197 --> 18:37.533
About the kind of leader
you were, so, yes...

18:40.077 --> 18:41.995
whatever you feel is right,
you should do.

18:43.539 --> 18:44.873
You have my full support.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.424
[Kevin] You've already
witnessed one miracle.

18:54.466 --> 18:58.137
Now, brothers and sisters,

18:58.178 --> 19:01.223
watch in wonder
as Cheryl manifests

19:01.265 --> 19:04.518
the collective pain
of our congregation.

19:04.560 --> 19:08.230
Behold! Her alabaster hands!

19:08.272 --> 19:12.317
-How they bleed
with the blood of the stigmata.
-[gasps]

19:12.359 --> 19:15.112
Mimicking the holy wounds
of Jason.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.905
[gasping]

19:18.073 --> 19:18.949
[Penelope scoffs]

19:26.665 --> 19:27.541
[Archie] Ma'am?

19:30.878 --> 19:32.588
I'd like to honor
your husband's memory,

19:32.629 --> 19:35.549
by having General Taylor
answer for his actions.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.134
But I'd like to do so
with your consent.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.387
To be honest,

19:40.429 --> 19:43.557
I've made peace with what
happened, Sergeant Andrews.

19:43.599 --> 19:46.768
I loved Aiden more
than anything. We were
high school sweethearts,

19:49.104 --> 19:51.607
but my son is my focus now.

19:51.648 --> 19:55.360
I need to start thinking
about his future.

19:55.402 --> 19:58.322
Right now, I'm just trying
to make it through the day
and even that's a struggle.

19:58.363 --> 19:59.531
[baby crying]

19:59.573 --> 20:00.991
So, I leave it to you,
Sergeant.

20:04.369 --> 20:05.537
Ma'am?

20:07.372 --> 20:08.540
You do what you see fit.

20:20.385 --> 20:23.347
Who knew spreading
light and love could be
this exhausting?

20:23.388 --> 20:25.265
Yeah, it's the Broadway grind.

20:25.307 --> 20:27.851
Anyway, I got a list
of potential third miracles.

20:27.893 --> 20:31.563
Although, my strong preference
is that we do the staff
and the snake trick.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.357
Though snakes are
unquestionably biblical,

20:33.398 --> 20:35.651
I already know what I want
my third miracle to be.

20:35.692 --> 20:39.279
Do you remember when I got
revenge on Mr. Honey,
lo, those many years ago?

20:39.321 --> 20:41.448
When he tried to ban
my back-to-school party?

20:41.490 --> 20:45.619
Yeah, but, Cheryl,
bees are not in my repertoire.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.329
I'm highly allergic.

20:48.121 --> 20:49.790
Fear not, Kev.

20:49.831 --> 20:51.875
As a girl, Nana Rose,
was an avid beekeeper.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.543
She taught me
all her apian secrets.

20:56.630 --> 20:57.631
Okay.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.926
[video call ringing]

21:02.803 --> 21:04.137
What do you want, Chadwick?

21:04.179 --> 21:05.722
I just got wind
of your auction.

21:05.764 --> 21:08.600
It pains me to see you
so desperate for funds.

21:08.642 --> 21:10.352
So I'm double-checking...

21:10.394 --> 21:13.272
Are you sure you don't
want in on my amazing deal?

21:13.313 --> 21:16.191
Surely you've heard
of CopterCab.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.902
The helicopter taxis
that fly one-percenters

21:18.944 --> 21:21.405
to Marcia's Vineyard
for private parties?

21:21.446 --> 21:22.864
That's you?

21:22.906 --> 21:25.617
It is. I'm more
of a silent partner.

21:25.659 --> 21:28.078
So do want in or not?

21:28.120 --> 21:31.039
Your father's also
working with me.

21:31.081 --> 21:33.625
As a matter of fact,
I killed it at my auction.

21:33.667 --> 21:37.421
So much so, that all
of your swindled investors
are paid in full.

21:37.462 --> 21:39.381
Just in time for the SEC,
I might add.

21:39.423 --> 21:43.343
So, no, I don't want in
on your little scheme.

21:43.385 --> 21:46.722
Well, listen,
CopterCab's going public.

21:46.763 --> 21:49.016
And we're celebrating
at your father's HQ.

21:49.057 --> 21:50.350
Why don't you come by?

21:50.392 --> 21:51.977
Blow off some steam.

21:52.019 --> 21:55.355
You know what?
I might just do that.

21:55.397 --> 21:56.982
Text me the deets,
will you?

21:57.024 --> 21:59.484
Happy to. And we'll
toast to the future.

21:59.526 --> 22:01.069
Looking forward to it.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.322
Goodbye, Chadwick.

22:03.363 --> 22:05.365
You're partying
with that smug nitwit?

22:05.407 --> 22:06.325
What am I missing?

22:06.366 --> 22:07.743
Me, Reggie.

22:07.784 --> 22:10.579
You're missing
the old me.

22:10.620 --> 22:14.166
I've been playing defense,
reacting to Chad's every move.

22:14.207 --> 22:17.586
Well, now that I don't
have to worry about the SEC,

22:17.627 --> 22:19.713
it's time I go
on the offensive,

22:19.755 --> 22:23.842
and take Chad Gekko off
the chessboard of my life,
once and for all.

22:23.884 --> 22:26.011
And if Daddy gets caught
in my crosshairs,

22:26.053 --> 22:27.888
so be it.

22:29.139 --> 22:30.015

[Samm] Hey, Jones.

22:55.290 --> 22:57.918
Hey, I finished
the novel.

22:57.959 --> 23:00.212
Not...Not a chapter,
not a draft,

23:00.253 --> 23:02.005
I mean, the whole thing.

23:02.047 --> 23:07.844
It is about a budding
young writer at NYU,

23:07.886 --> 23:09.721
just making her way
through the world,

23:09.763 --> 23:12.724
having a lot sex
and partying.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.101
Sounds terrific.

23:14.142 --> 23:16.603
-Send it to me ASAP.
-Yeah, okay.

23:16.645 --> 23:19.815
All right.

There's no easy path

35:07.647 --> 35:09.982
You're in for a rude
awakening.

35:10.024 --> 35:14.987
Later, when you're alone,
give your SoDale model
another look-see.

35:15.029 --> 35:18.783
I think you'll find that
you've lost much more
than you realize.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.578
Come on, ladies.

35:22.620 --> 35:25.414
Let's get out of here.
This party's over.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.629
[Tabitha] Hey, Jughead.

35:31.671 --> 35:35.383
You okay?
I just mentioned free food
and you didn't salivate.

35:35.424 --> 35:39.846
Yeah, just worried
about Betty, you know.

35:39.887 --> 35:42.765
Yeah, I can imagine.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.392
[ballad playing]

35:44.433 --> 35:48.146
But I'm also worried
about you.

35:48.187 --> 35:49.856
And your recovery.

35:49.897 --> 35:53.693
I smelled booze
on your breath
when you came in.

35:53.734 --> 35:54.986
[sighs]

35:56.445 --> 35:58.156
Yeah, I had
sort of a backslide.

35:58.197 --> 35:59.991
Jughead, I know that you
want to help Betty,

36:00.032 --> 36:02.952
but you need
to focus on you.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.787
She's out there alone
on the Lonely Highway.

36:04.829 --> 36:07.456
I'm... I'm sure.
But don't worry about Betty.

36:07.498 --> 36:09.167
I'll take care of her.

36:09.208 --> 36:11.711
Your priority is you.

36:12.503 --> 36:13.546
Okay?

36:18.634 --> 36:20.803
You know
I'm a drunk, right?

36:20.845 --> 36:22.513
I'm a terrible busboy.

36:22.555 --> 36:23.848
Why are you so
nice to me?

36:23.890 --> 36:26.058
Because you're my friend.

36:27.935 --> 36:29.145
And I care about you.

36:32.732 --> 36:36.068
So will you promise me
that you'll keep going
to your meetings?

36:41.324 --> 36:44.160
Yeah. Yes, yes, I promise.

36:45.077 --> 36:46.037
Good.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.499
So tell me,
what's going on with Betty?

37:11.812 --> 37:12.772
[blows sharply]

37:16.817 --> 37:18.402
[exhales]

37:18.444 --> 37:20.321
Oh, no, no, no, no.

37:22.448 --> 37:23.824
No, no, no, no.

37:24.700 --> 37:25.952
[phone ringing]

37:28.704 --> 37:32.708
Hello. Yeah,
this is Archie Andrews.

37:39.173 --> 37:40.132
Okay.

37:42.760 --> 37:45.179
Understood.
Thank you so much.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.180
Bye.

37:46.973 --> 37:48.140
[hangs up phone]

37:49.934 --> 37:51.769
Guys, that was a JAG officer
with the verdict.

37:51.811 --> 37:55.064
Hurry up, Sarge, before I hurl.

37:55.106 --> 37:58.901
"The tribunal has determined
that Corporal Eric Jackson
was following the direct

37:58.943 --> 38:01.279
and explicit orders
of his commanding officer

38:01.320 --> 38:04.323
and therefore is not guilty
of any wrongdoing

38:04.365 --> 38:07.368
and remains in good
standing with the US Army."

38:07.410 --> 38:09.328
What about General Taylor?

38:09.370 --> 38:11.664
His actions were
determined to be reckless
and of poor judgment.

38:11.706 --> 38:13.249
He was driven by his own
self-interests

38:13.291 --> 38:16.210
and therefore he's being
discharged without honors.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.921
The Army got it right.

38:18.963 --> 38:21.674
So... It's over?

38:22.425 --> 38:23.384
It's over.

38:33.060 --> 38:35.604
[footsteps approaching]

38:54.498 --> 38:55.499
[knocking on door]

38:57.126 --> 38:59.879
-Tabitha-
-Jughead told me
what you're doing, Betty.

38:59.920 --> 39:02.381
And it's dangerous
and it's reckless.

39:02.423 --> 39:05.468
And no matter what I say,
you're not going to stop.

39:05.509 --> 39:06.427
I know that.

39:07.345 --> 39:08.304
So...

39:10.139 --> 39:12.183
-I'm going with you.
-Come again?

39:12.224 --> 39:15.519
I'm getting changed
and I'm going with you.

39:15.561 --> 39:19.774
Oh, and by the way,
my participation
is not negotiable.

39:24.111 --> 39:25.321
You boys did it!

39:25.363 --> 39:26.364
[all chuckling]

39:26.405 --> 39:29.283
You should be proud.

39:29.325 --> 39:33.120
I am proud to have served
with the bravest men
that I've ever known.

39:36.665 --> 39:38.334
Here's to our fallen
band of brothers.

39:42.004 --> 39:45.216
To their service,
to their sacrifice.

39:47.134 --> 39:48.886
Gone, but never forgotten.

39:48.928 --> 39:49.970
-Never.
-Never.

39:56.519 --> 39:58.145
[Kevin sighs] Cheryl,

39:58.187 --> 40:00.106
I have to ask,
how did you manage
those bees

40:00.147 --> 40:02.191
once they were
outside the tank?

40:02.233 --> 40:06.862
Did you rub some special
insect-repelling ointment
all over your body?

40:08.739 --> 40:09.782
The truth?

40:12.034 --> 40:13.869
Uh...

40:13.911 --> 40:17.289
I didn't have any ointment
on any part of my body.

40:18.374 --> 40:19.542
What are you saying?

40:27.800 --> 40:33.556
Something inside me
has shifted, Kevin.

40:34.765 --> 40:37.810
Something powerful,

40:37.852 --> 40:42.523
something... [chuckles]
I can't explain.

40:42.565 --> 40:51.157
But I'm feeling more connected
to things than I have in years.

40:51.198 --> 40:55.744
[chuckles] I'm not saying I'm
the first-ever living saint.

41:00.541 --> 41:02.668
But what if I am?

41:02.710 --> 41:06.213
What if I,
Cheryl Marjorie Blossom,

41:07.590 --> 41:09.216
am the holiest
of holies?

41:11.135 --> 41:14.430
Wouldn't that be miraculous?

41:18.309 --> 41:21.395
My name
is Jughead Jones...

41:21.437 --> 41:24.857
I used to be seven days sober,
but now, I'm back down to one.

41:26.859 --> 41:29.653
I hope to make it
to eight this time.

41:29.695 --> 41:32.072
Tonight, I'm worried about
a couple of friends,

41:32.114 --> 41:36.410
but I'm also trying to accept
the things I cannot change.

41:36.452 --> 41:38.454
And I'm grateful to you all.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.539
[truck honking]

41:42.291 --> 41:44.376
And if there is some
higher power,

41:44.418 --> 41:47.546
man, I hope it's looking
down upon them tonight,

41:47.588 --> 41:49.673
and keeping them safe.

41:49.715 --> 41:52.718
I don't know why,
but I've got a really
bad feeling

41:52.760 --> 41:54.178
about what happens next.
