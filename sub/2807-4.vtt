WEBVTT

00:05.588 --> 00:10.884
Wait. Before we go in, I just
want you to know that I love you.

00:11.052 --> 00:13.887
And I had a great time
on our honeymoon.

00:14.055 --> 00:17.725
I can't wait to go in there and spend
the rest of our life together.

00:17.892 --> 00:20.060
You're sticking with
the shell necklace, huh?

00:21.896 --> 00:23.897
- Hey, you're back! Woo-hoo!
- Yay!

00:25.692 --> 00:28.360
- Come on in!
- Yeah, come on!

00:31.239 --> 00:33.115
How was the honeymoon?

00:33.283 --> 00:37.661
So much fun. The best part is, we met
this incredible couple on the flight back.

00:37.829 --> 00:42.374
That was the best part?
Good honeymooning, tiger.

00:42.792 --> 00:45.794
They're cool.
They were on their honeymoon too.

00:45.962 --> 00:48.088
They're terrific. They live here in the city.

00:48.256 --> 00:52.092
Can we go call them? Is it too soon to call?
I wanna call.

00:52.260 --> 00:55.888
Sorry, we're excited. We finally
have a couple to hang out with.

00:56.056 --> 01:00.976
A couple? Like two people?
Like one, two people?

01:01.478 --> 01:04.730
This is different.
Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.

01:04.897 --> 01:08.233
Ugh, Greg and Jenny. Ugh!
"Hi, Greg. I'm Chandler. This is Monica."

01:08.401 --> 01:10.736
"Hi, Monica. This is Jenny."
"Hi, Jenny. Hi, Greg."

01:13.865 --> 01:16.909
- Listen, they're great. If you got a chance...
- You know what?

01:17.077 --> 01:20.537
Why don't you give us our souvenirs
and get the hell out of here.

01:21.498 --> 01:25.375
- We didn't get a chance to...
- You've got to be kidding me!

01:25.543 --> 01:29.755
- We didn't get anything for anyone.
- Mm-hm, yeah. Nice necklace.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.967
That you can have.

02:11.172 --> 02:12.589
- Hi.
- Hey!

02:12.757 --> 02:14.925
- Hello!
- Welcome home.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.927
So, how was the honeymoon?

02:17.095 --> 02:20.097
Great! How about you?
I mean, you're having a baby!

02:20.306 --> 02:24.393
- Oh, look, I have a sonogram picture.
- Oh, good.

02:25.436 --> 02:29.106
Ross, it's got your wavy, black lines.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.443
So now that Ross knows,
can you tell us how it happened?

02:33.611 --> 02:36.280
When did it happen?
How many times did it happen?

02:36.447 --> 02:38.866
- Monica, that's not right.
- What?

02:39.033 --> 02:40.367
Start with where.

02:43.204 --> 02:46.623
Well, it happened about six weeks ago.

02:46.791 --> 02:50.210
And, uh, I had just got home from work
and Ross was already there.

02:50.378 --> 02:54.381
- I guess he'd been hanging out with Joey.
- You're welcome, buddy.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.137
Yeah, thanks.

03:01.389 --> 03:05.809
And so I had a lot of work, and Ross,
nice guy that he is, offered to help me out.

03:05.977 --> 03:08.770
And then we had wine,
we got to talking.

03:08.938 --> 03:12.274
Next thing you know,
out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.109
Um, heh. That's...

03:14.277 --> 03:16.945
That's a little misleading.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.365
- What is?
- The lie you just told.

03:21.743 --> 03:25.287
- That you came on to me?
- There's the one!

03:25.496 --> 03:28.957
- But you did. Let's be honest.
- Yes, let's.

03:31.419 --> 03:33.503
You know what? Uh, it's not important.

03:33.671 --> 03:36.048
Heh, what's important is
that we're having a baby.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.592
It doesn't matter who came on to who.

03:38.801 --> 03:40.928
"Whom."

03:43.431 --> 03:45.724
That's right.

03:46.935 --> 03:50.562
- You kissed me first.
- What? You were begging me to kiss you!

03:50.813 --> 03:53.273
You were sending me signals
all over the place.

03:53.441 --> 03:55.275
- I was sending signals? Please.
- Yeah.

03:55.443 --> 03:58.904
Okay, anyone think that
I'd actually send Ross begging signals?

03:59.072 --> 04:00.864
Please, show of hands.

04:03.952 --> 04:08.330
It doesn't matter what people "believe."
What matters is what happened.

04:08.498 --> 04:11.458
These signals, explain this.
Maybe I need to be more careful.

04:11.626 --> 04:13.835
Am I you sending these signals
right now?

04:14.003 --> 04:18.673
- You know what? Just drop it.
- Show me how I begged you.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.218
I can show you!
I have it on videotape.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.812
It's an expression.

04:36.859 --> 04:40.237
I can't believe he taped
the two of them having sex.

04:40.405 --> 04:43.532
Yeah. You gotta tell a girl
before you tape her.

04:44.909 --> 04:47.494
Such a rookie mistake.

04:47.996 --> 04:51.665
- Know who has a great camera?
- Greg and Jenny?

04:52.417 --> 04:54.960
- Do you want to call them? I want to.
- Let's call.

04:55.169 --> 04:57.421
Ask them if they brought
their friends souvenirs.

05:04.095 --> 05:06.471
Hello? 8th Street Deli?

05:06.681 --> 05:10.726
Hey, hang up. You get food poisoning
just talking to that place.

05:10.977 --> 05:14.021
- Sorry, wrong number.
- Here you go, babe.

05:16.566 --> 05:19.609
Hello? It's the deli again!

05:19.777 --> 05:21.945
All right, I'll have a sandwich.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.448
I don't think this number's right.

05:28.786 --> 05:32.581
- What?
- You got fake-numbered.

05:33.541 --> 05:37.836
- What? People don't do that.
- Oh, I think we do.

05:38.004 --> 05:41.131
- A fake number? Why would they do that?
- I don't know.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.008
You were a delight to talk to.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.552
You asked those insightful,
great questions.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.095
And you've never been funnier.

05:47.263 --> 05:50.724
I mean, joke, joke, joke!
You were a hoot!

05:50.892 --> 05:53.518
Don't worry about it.
You still got me and Phoebe.

05:53.686 --> 05:56.605
Excuse me, I don't want
Greg and Jenny's rejects.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.819
Rachel won't talk to me.
She won't open the door.

06:02.987 --> 06:05.030
Hmm, I wonder why, pervert.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.741
Okay, listen, I am not a pervert.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.243
That's, like, the pervert motto.

06:10.411 --> 06:13.163
Yeah, they have you
raise your right hand...

06:13.331 --> 06:16.083
...put your left hand down your pants
and repeat that.

06:17.668 --> 06:20.212
Filming Rachel was not
something I planned.

06:20.421 --> 06:23.673
Look, here's what happened.
And Joey can back me up on this.

06:23.883 --> 06:27.469
About a month and a half ago,
remember I came to you with a problem?

06:27.637 --> 06:29.554
Um, a...

06:29.722 --> 06:31.640
The personal thing?

06:33.518 --> 06:37.437
- Pers...? What personal thing?
- About... About sex?

06:39.023 --> 06:40.857
That I hadn't had sex in months?

06:42.693 --> 06:45.612
Yeah, I knew what
you were talking about.

06:50.993 --> 06:53.745
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:55.164 --> 06:56.456
Do you have a minute?

06:56.624 --> 07:00.127
I'd like to talk about something
I'm uncomfortable talking about.

07:00.336 --> 07:02.045
Sure, yeah.

07:02.797 --> 07:06.425
How about, uh,
you showering with your mom?

07:08.553 --> 07:10.762
I actually had a topic in mind.

07:14.934 --> 07:20.355
I'm kind of going through
a dry spell, sex-wise.

07:20.523 --> 07:23.483
- Oh, for, like, months?
- Five, to be...

07:23.651 --> 07:25.569
...lying. Six.

07:25.736 --> 07:28.321
Six months? That's rough.

07:28.489 --> 07:33.201
Well, it's not all bad. I'm learning to
appreciate the, uh, small things in life.

07:33.369 --> 07:38.707
Like the sound of a bird,
or the color of the sky.

07:38.875 --> 07:42.669
The sky's blue, Ross.
And I had sex yesterday.

07:44.672 --> 07:47.507
Please help me.
I have a date tonight.

07:47.717 --> 07:51.011
It has to go well.
I'm scared for my health.

07:51.179 --> 07:56.016
Okay, okay. Oh! I got something.
It's this story that I came up with.

07:56.225 --> 08:00.061
Very romantic.
Any woman that hears it, they're like putty.

08:00.229 --> 08:01.855
Really? Tell it to me.

08:02.023 --> 08:05.775
Okay. Now, you're gonna want to have sex
with me when you hear it.

08:05.943 --> 08:10.071
But you have to remember,
it is just the story.

08:11.574 --> 08:16.328
- I'll try to control myself.
- Okay. Ahem.

08:17.371 --> 08:20.707
Years ago, when I was backpacking
across Western Europe...

08:20.875 --> 08:23.919
Heh, you were backpacking
across Europe?

08:24.086 --> 08:26.922
- Have a nice six more months, Ross.
- Okay, okay!

08:27.089 --> 08:32.760
I'm sorry. Please, please.
You were in Western Europe, and?

08:34.514 --> 08:39.893
I was outside Barcelona, hiking
in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo.

08:42.395 --> 08:46.942
I was at the end of this path.
I came to a clearing, and there was a lake.

08:47.193 --> 08:51.238
Very secluded.
There were tall trees all around.

08:51.489 --> 08:55.075
It was dead silent. Gorgeous.

08:55.326 --> 09:01.248
And across the lake I saw
a beautiful woman bathing herself.

09:01.499 --> 09:04.417
But she was crying.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.587
Why?

09:13.386 --> 09:16.805
Mm! Mm, this is great wine.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.349
It's from France.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.353
In Europe.

09:23.604 --> 09:26.147
Western Europe.

09:28.651 --> 09:34.072
You know, um, a few years ago
I was backpacking across Western Europe.

09:34.240 --> 09:38.034
- Really?
- Mm-hm. Wait, it gets better.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.706
Um, yeah, I was in, um, Barcelona.

09:42.873 --> 09:46.793
I studied for a year in Barcelona.

09:48.588 --> 09:52.716
- Anyway, um, so I was hiking...
- I love hiking!

09:52.925 --> 09:54.926
Oh, that's great!

09:56.762 --> 10:01.308
I was hiking along the foothills
of Mount Tibidaybo...

10:01.517 --> 10:05.645
- I think it's "Tibidabo."
- Okay, do you want to tell the story?

10:09.317 --> 10:11.568
Whoa, what are you doing here?
How'd your date go?

10:11.736 --> 10:14.613
Great. I'm across the street
having sex right now.

10:16.449 --> 10:21.328
- Your story sucks.
- If it didn't work, you didn't tell it right.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.914
- Show me how you did it.
- No, I don't want to.

10:25.124 --> 10:30.462
- How long since you seen a girl naked?
- I was backpacking across Western Europe.

10:30.630 --> 10:35.925
- I'm not feeling it.
- I was outside Barcelona, hiking...

10:36.135 --> 10:41.806
- No, Ross, I'm not hot. Are you hot?
- It's been six months. I'm always hot.

10:42.016 --> 10:46.061
You're not selling the story.
You don't believe it.

10:46.312 --> 10:49.272
I gotta go, I got a date.
But try this.

10:49.523 --> 10:52.067
Do what I do
when I'm preparing for an audition.

10:52.234 --> 10:54.069
I'll set you up with my video camera.

10:54.236 --> 10:57.155
You can record yourself
and see what you're doing wrong.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.948
I'll try that.

10:59.158 --> 11:02.911
All right. Now, you're all set up.
Good to go.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.330
- Just hit record. Good luck.
- Thanks.

11:05.498 --> 11:09.292
And Joe, listen. If you ever have
any problem with the ladies...

11:09.460 --> 11:11.503
...you know I'll help you out.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.468
That means a lot to me, man.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.569
Hello.

11:37.947 --> 11:43.410
Can I get you anything?
Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?

11:44.453 --> 11:45.787
- Rachel.
- Oh, Ross.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.414
- Hi.
- Thank God you're here.

11:47.581 --> 11:50.542
You have to help me.
Were you just talking to yourself?

11:51.794 --> 11:55.505
That's less embarrassing.
Yes. Yes, I was.

11:55.756 --> 11:59.759
When she came in, I got distracted
and totally forgot about the camera.

11:59.927 --> 12:03.054
It kept rolling and recorded everything.

12:05.224 --> 12:08.476
- Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape.
- Yeah.

12:09.311 --> 12:13.189
What a great idea!
That'll get Rachel to forgive me.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.443
This is not fair to her.
Let's forget the tape.

12:16.610 --> 12:18.403
Thank you.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.405
You'll show it to me.

12:21.824 --> 12:24.701
- No.
- You're right.

12:26.412 --> 12:30.248
- Joey, no.
- Loud and clear.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.966
I don't get why Greg and Jenny
would give us a fake number.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.635
You know, if they knew
what they were doing...

12:42.803 --> 12:46.181
...they didn't give you real names either.
- Okay.

12:46.390 --> 12:50.226
Maybe people give out fake numbers,
but they don't give out fake names.

12:50.394 --> 12:51.853
Oh, yeah?

12:52.021 --> 12:54.147
Hi. Ken Adams. Nice to meet you.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.068
Regina Phalange.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.530
- We didn't do anything wrong.
- I know.

13:04.492 --> 13:08.036
Although you did tell
an awful lot of jokes.

13:08.871 --> 13:12.707
I thought you said those jokes
were funny. Joke, joke, joke!

13:12.875 --> 13:14.042
Joke, joke...

13:20.508 --> 13:23.551
- Maybe it was your questions.
- What about my questions?

13:23.719 --> 13:27.806
The sheer volume.
It was like flying with the Riddler.

13:30.267 --> 13:34.187
- Ooh, sorry, was that another joke?
- Was that another question?

13:36.982 --> 13:39.901
- Hey, is Ross still here?
- Uh, no, Rach, he's gone, but listen.

13:40.069 --> 13:43.571
He told us what happened.
It sounds like an honest mistake.

13:43.739 --> 13:48.535
Really? How would you like it if I had sex
with you and I taped it?

13:48.744 --> 13:50.995
Oh, forget it.

13:52.665 --> 13:57.836
Oh, there he is, the father of my child,
the porn king of the West Village.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.172
Look, it was an accident, okay?

14:01.340 --> 14:04.676
I feel bad it happened.
I swear, I didn't even watch it.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.720
Anyway, here.

14:07.888 --> 14:11.891
I thought you might be more comfortable
destroying it yourself.

14:12.059 --> 14:14.143
Thank you.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.402
What?

14:24.822 --> 14:28.533
- You don't want to see this, do you?
- Hell, yeah!

14:29.660 --> 14:32.245
I am not gonna show you this.

14:32.413 --> 14:36.291
Not the sex part.
Just the stuff leading up to it.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.668
Forget it. She's destroying it.

14:38.836 --> 14:42.255
Okay, fine! Fine. We'll just have to think
of some other way...

14:42.423 --> 14:44.674
...to put the "who came on to who"
thing to rest.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.176
Come on now, think!

14:48.596 --> 14:52.891
Forget it. It's Rachel's tape,
and she can do whatever she wants with it.

14:53.058 --> 14:57.562
And she wants to destroy it,
so end of story.

14:57.813 --> 15:01.649
- I want to see it.
- What?

15:01.817 --> 15:04.027
Clearly you don't want people
to see this tape.

15:04.194 --> 15:06.195
I don't want people
to see this tape either.

15:06.363 --> 15:10.575
But you so badly don't want people to see
it that it makes me want to see it. See?

15:12.703 --> 15:15.663
Are we watching the tape or not?

15:16.373 --> 15:22.045
- I don't want people to see it for your sake.
- Oh, I don't believe you.

15:22.212 --> 15:25.298
I think you don't want them
to see you begging me.

15:27.176 --> 15:31.095
- Rachel, please?
- Oh, a little preview.

15:32.723 --> 15:37.977
Fine. But I want the record to show
that I tried to take the high road.

15:38.228 --> 15:40.939
Because in about five minutes,
I'm gonna be saying:

15:49.365 --> 15:51.282
Okay, here we go.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.577
Hello. Can I can get you anything?

15:54.745 --> 15:56.996
I'm so happy.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.502
Oh, thank God you're here.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.046
I need you to help me.
Were you talking to yourself?

16:05.214 --> 16:09.258
- Oh, there I am.
- You're gonna get pregnant.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.636
I screwed up so bad.

16:11.845 --> 16:17.141
I told Monica that I'd stuff and send
those wedding invitations weeks ago.

16:17.309 --> 16:18.476
You didn't do it?

16:18.644 --> 16:21.187
I had put them in...
In my desk at work...

16:21.355 --> 16:24.273
...and I forgot about them until today.

16:27.528 --> 16:32.448
Sweetie, it's okay.
Everybody made it to the wedding. I'm fine.

16:32.700 --> 16:37.161
- Kind of hurting my hand though.
- I know.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.122
I can not believe that I did this.

16:39.289 --> 16:43.001
Especially after Monica
just went on and on and on about it.

16:43.168 --> 16:47.588
"Here are the invitations, Rachel.
Be very careful, Rachel.

16:47.756 --> 16:50.842
Please drinking no liquids
around the invitations, Rachel."

16:51.010 --> 16:53.261
Whoa, oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

16:53.429 --> 16:55.430
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

17:01.645 --> 17:04.063
Did you do it on our invitations?

17:07.943 --> 17:11.154
Not on the ones we sent out.

17:11.780 --> 17:16.784
So just the ones you gave back to us
and we had framed?

17:24.084 --> 17:25.792
Can you believe this is happening?

17:25.961 --> 17:29.881
- It seems like yesterday they got engaged.
- I know.

17:30.049 --> 17:35.219
Remember the night they got engaged?
How you and I almost...

17:35.387 --> 17:38.389
Oh, I remember how we almost.

17:39.349 --> 17:42.685
You think we would've gone through with it
if we hadn't gotten caught?

17:42.853 --> 17:45.563
You think we would have done it?

17:47.524 --> 17:51.903
I know I wanted to.
I just wasn't sure if you wanted to.

17:52.112 --> 17:54.947
Oh, I wanted to.

17:55.532 --> 17:59.952
So we... We both wanted to.

18:00.704 --> 18:03.081
- Interesting.
- Mm.

18:05.793 --> 18:11.297
Anyway, um,
probably worked out for the best.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.258
Yeah, sure.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.053
In about 10 seconds,
you're gonna see him kiss me.

18:17.221 --> 18:21.349
And in about 5 seconds,
you're gonna see why.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.938
Ross, did I ever tell you about the time...

18:27.106 --> 18:30.525
...that I went backpacking
through Western Europe?

18:37.407 --> 18:40.409
Okay, get ready to see some begging.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.579
Oh, you came on to Ross!

18:44.456 --> 18:47.667
- What?
- Now I'm so happy.

18:48.585 --> 18:52.046
- What are you talking about?
- You used the Europe story!

18:52.214 --> 18:55.675
That's the magic story you use
when you want to have sex!

18:57.803 --> 19:03.182
- How do you know about that story?
- How do you know about that story?

19:03.433 --> 19:06.811
I heard it from my friend Irene
who heard it from some guy.

19:07.437 --> 19:09.689
Some guy!

19:12.484 --> 19:15.153
No, no, she told me that
his name was Ken Adams.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.532
Ken Adams!

19:28.917 --> 19:30.251
Hi.

19:30.419 --> 19:34.088
So apparently, uh, people are familiar
with the Europe story?

19:34.256 --> 19:36.132
Yeah, listen, about that...

19:36.300 --> 19:40.219
...the whole "who came on to who"
thing really doesn't matter.

19:40.387 --> 19:43.347
I think it would have happened
either way.

19:43.515 --> 19:47.393
I mean, if you hadn't initiated it,
I know I would have.

19:49.396 --> 19:53.566
- It was an amazing night.
- It was. It was an amazing night.

19:56.153 --> 19:59.280
You think it looked amazing?

20:00.199 --> 20:05.119
I, uh... I don't know.
I honestly didn't watch it.

20:05.287 --> 20:07.079
Yeah, me neither.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.457
Yet.

20:12.669 --> 20:14.003
Uh...

20:14.171 --> 20:18.716
- That... That may be weird.
- Yeah, it would be really weird.

20:30.103 --> 20:32.980
- Good luck.
- Good luck to you.

20:33.607 --> 20:37.318
- Mind if I mute?
- Oh, please.

20:37.903 --> 20:42.573
- Oh, there go the clothes.
- You are undressing awfully quickly.

20:42.741 --> 20:45.952
Six months, Rachel. Six months.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.080
- Huh.
- Huh.

20:51.124 --> 20:53.501
- Huh.
- Hey. Heh.

20:54.253 --> 20:58.589
- We look pretty good.
- I was gonna say.

20:58.757 --> 21:01.842
- Ooh, nice tan.
- Thank you.

21:02.010 --> 21:05.346
- I'd just gone to the beach that weekend.
- Ah.

21:06.556 --> 21:07.974
Ugh.

21:08.141 --> 21:12.895
- Have you been working out?
- I have been working out.

21:14.564 --> 21:16.565
Well, this is so much better than I ever...

21:16.733 --> 21:18.067
- Oh.
- Oh.

21:20.195 --> 21:21.821
- Ew.
- Ew.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.200
- Oh, that's not pretty.
- Oh.

21:26.368 --> 21:28.077
- Oh. Oh, God.
- Oh.

21:28.245 --> 21:31.622
- Oh, no. Oh, no! No!
- Make it stop. Make it stop.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.381
Hello, Greg?
Hi, this is Monica from the plane.

21:40.590 --> 21:44.468
Listen, the number that
you gave me, uh, 8-5-3...

21:44.678 --> 21:47.722
Their old number! Jenny's been
giving it out since they moved!

21:47.889 --> 21:51.851
- Jenny! That is so Jenny!
- I know.

21:52.019 --> 21:55.938
Listen, um, how would you like to
get together next Saturday?

21:56.106 --> 21:58.316
Okay, how about Sunday?

21:58.483 --> 22:01.193
Okay, um, the week after that?

22:01.361 --> 22:02.987
The week after that?

22:03.488 --> 22:04.947
You know what, Greg? Heh.

22:05.115 --> 22:09.410
We are good, interesting,
funny people with good questions.

22:09.578 --> 22:13.456
And if you and your precious Jenny
can't see that, then...

22:13.623 --> 22:15.333
January 15?

22:15.500 --> 22:18.127
We'll see you then! Okay!
