WEBVTT

00:01.507 --> 00:02.173
Who do you think I am?

00:02.208 --> 00:03.241
We don't know yet.

00:03.276 --> 00:04.442
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:04.477 --> 00:05.487
Why can't you trust anyone?

00:05.511 --> 00:06.591
Because you trust everyone!

00:07.079 --> 00:08.439
I'm meant to be part of this pack.

00:09.282 --> 00:10.315
I get night terrors.

00:13.419 --> 00:14.419
Tracy?

00:14.453 --> 00:15.620
Are you all right?

00:16.187 --> 00:18.233
I'm starting to wonder if the
rules to our supernatural world

00:18.257 --> 00:19.824
aren't as rigid as I once thought.

00:21.661 --> 00:23.662
Or maybe someone's trying
to change those rules.

01:02.824 --> 01:05.090
Oh, I should've got a haircut.

01:06.127 --> 01:07.404
Well, you know someone
your age should be happy

01:07.428 --> 01:08.762
you still have hair to cut.

01:09.764 --> 01:11.097
I think you look great.

01:11.532 --> 01:13.266
Well, thank you, son I should have had.

01:16.370 --> 01:17.537
Oh, what the hell am I doing?

01:17.572 --> 01:19.139
This is a terrible idea.

01:19.173 --> 01:21.608
What, Dad... Dad, it's one date, okay?

01:21.642 --> 01:23.210
The town of Beacon Hills won't implode

01:23.244 --> 01:24.524
while you're out with one woman.

01:24.812 --> 01:25.879
Or man.

01:26.380 --> 01:27.357
It's a woman, Stiles.

01:27.381 --> 01:28.615
Okay.

01:28.649 --> 01:29.649
A very beautiful woman.

01:30.551 --> 01:32.118
What beautiful woman, by the way?

01:32.153 --> 01:35.021
None of your business. Either one of you.

01:39.327 --> 01:40.327
I want to know.

01:43.364 --> 01:45.332
I'll be blunt. It's not
what I was hoping for,

01:45.366 --> 01:47.701
but the DA's offer is
still pretty reasonable.

01:47.735 --> 01:49.069
What's reasonable?

01:49.103 --> 01:50.871
Talk in the van, guys. Let's go.

01:50.905 --> 01:52.439
No! Just tell me. What's reasonable?

01:52.473 --> 01:54.793
Mr. Stewart, are we going to
have trouble with your client?

01:55.676 --> 01:56.710
No, Deputy.

01:59.814 --> 02:01.314
They want you for three to five.

02:01.349 --> 02:03.026
So, why don't we get in the van and discuss

02:03.050 --> 02:04.784
a plea bargain that gets you out in two.

02:07.488 --> 02:08.555
Stilinski!

02:10.390 --> 02:11.391
Stilinski!

02:15.596 --> 02:16.730
I'm going to kill you.

02:16.764 --> 02:18.965
Donovan, if you think that shocks me,

02:19.934 --> 02:21.434
remember it was well-documented

02:21.469 --> 02:22.903
in your Anger Expression Inventory.

02:23.671 --> 02:25.539
Deputies, escort the prisoner out.

02:25.773 --> 02:27.474
I'm not angry like I'm gonna throw a brick

02:27.508 --> 02:28.441
through your window.

02:28.476 --> 02:29.576
I'm angry,

02:30.144 --> 02:31.224
like I'm going to find you,

02:32.513 --> 02:33.613
I'm going to get a knife

02:33.648 --> 02:35.949
and I'm going to stab you
with it until you're dead.

02:37.018 --> 02:39.252
And when you look at me and you ask me why,

02:39.687 --> 02:40.754
remember right now.

02:41.689 --> 02:43.189
Because this is why.

02:50.631 --> 02:51.898
Wow, that was awesome.

02:53.401 --> 02:54.645
That was awesome. That was great.

02:54.669 --> 02:55.879
We do one more? Give us another one,

02:55.903 --> 02:58.038
maybe like Christopher
Walken this time, you know.

02:59.907 --> 03:01.174
Okay, you know what? It's fine.

03:01.208 --> 03:02.953
You'll have plenty of time
to work on it when you're

03:02.977 --> 03:04.288
in your tiny, little cell, you know.

03:04.312 --> 03:05.779
Just stuck there, forever.

03:10.718 --> 03:11.918
Get him out of here!

03:17.291 --> 03:19.326
What's the hell's an
Anger Expression Inventory?

03:19.894 --> 03:21.405
It's a test you take when you're applying

03:21.429 --> 03:22.429
to become a deputy.

03:23.631 --> 03:25.165
That guy wanted to be a cop?

03:26.667 --> 03:29.107
At least now he's getting the
full law enforcement experience.

03:35.710 --> 03:37.110
Well done.

03:37.144 --> 03:39.779
Threatening the Sheriff in
front of his entire department.

03:39.814 --> 03:40.847
And his son.

03:41.482 --> 03:43.717
I'll be lucky to get you
three to five decades.

03:43.751 --> 03:44.884
You realize that?

03:53.661 --> 03:54.794
Do you mind slowing down?

03:54.829 --> 03:56.949
I don't think this kid's in
any rush to get to prison.

04:04.572 --> 04:05.639
You all right?

04:05.673 --> 04:07.240
No. My hand, I...

04:08.376 --> 04:09.476
Uh, I think I'm having a...

04:09.510 --> 04:10.510
Whoa!

04:12.647 --> 04:14.381
All right, all right. Slow down.

04:14.415 --> 04:15.515
What the hell's going on?

04:15.549 --> 04:16.850
I can't! I can't...

04:16.884 --> 04:18.151
He's having a heart attack...

04:22.356 --> 04:23.657
My legs! I can't move my legs!

04:24.325 --> 04:27.360
No. No. Grab the wheel. Grab the wheel.

04:30.698 --> 04:31.598
Can you hit the brake?

04:31.632 --> 04:32.699
No!

04:39.940 --> 04:40.974
What's happening?

04:41.008 --> 04:43.109
I got the wheel! Let go of the wheel!

04:48.816 --> 04:49.849
Get off the road!

04:49.884 --> 04:51.284
Go for the brake! Go for the brake!

04:55.256 --> 04:56.296
Get off the road!

04:59.894 --> 05:01.361
Hit the brake. Hit the brake!

05:05.599 --> 05:06.599
Hit my brake!

05:25.419 --> 05:26.986
There's something on the roof.

05:43.037 --> 05:44.104
Tracy?

05:48.075 --> 05:50.443
- Holy...
- Tracy! Tracy!

05:58.719 --> 06:00.687
Tracy! Tracy!

06:34.588 --> 06:35.588
Tracy?

06:36.924 --> 06:38.124
Don't worry, Daddy.

06:38.859 --> 06:40.493
I won't let anything happen to you.

06:41.729 --> 06:42.862
Ever

06:44.131 --> 06:45.465
again.

08:38.879 --> 08:39.879
It's anxiety.

08:41.215 --> 08:42.448
What is?

08:42.482 --> 08:43.883
The chemo signals?

08:43.918 --> 08:46.552
Oh, I'm well aware of how you
all monitor my emotional state.

08:46.587 --> 08:48.254
Yeah.

08:52.993 --> 08:54.060
You okay?

08:56.864 --> 08:57.931
All right.

09:02.036 --> 09:04.037
I got this from Braeden a few hours ago.

09:08.242 --> 09:09.686
That's the first real bit of information

09:09.710 --> 09:11.390
we've gotten on the Desert Wolf in months.

09:12.112 --> 09:13.346
The Desert Wolf did this?

09:13.380 --> 09:15.748
Yeah. And I'm the one who's
been pulling on this thread.

09:17.584 --> 09:18.685
Maybe you should stop.

09:19.086 --> 09:20.086
No, it's not up to me.

09:32.733 --> 09:35.268
Okay. Hands on the
wheel, at 10:00 and 2:00.

09:36.804 --> 09:39.038
Actually, the recommended
position is now 9:00 and 3:00.

09:39.773 --> 09:41.674
At 10:00 and 2:00, a deployed airbag

09:41.709 --> 09:42.709
could break your thumbs.

09:43.610 --> 09:44.711
Mine would heal.

09:44.945 --> 09:45.945
Save your strength.

09:46.747 --> 09:48.982
And try not to destroy
your beautiful new car.

09:49.917 --> 09:50.917
9:00 and 3:00.

10:11.138 --> 10:13.439
All right. Just ease into it.

10:14.875 --> 10:17.243
Good, good, okay. There you go.

10:17.277 --> 10:18.378
Please shut up.

10:19.013 --> 10:20.613
No problem. Shutting up.

10:22.983 --> 10:25.018
Uh... Other way.

10:25.986 --> 10:27.053
Other way.

10:29.623 --> 10:31.124
Uh, other way.

10:31.825 --> 10:33.905
We are now off the
road, this is not the road.

10:34.928 --> 10:35.928
Other way.

10:36.830 --> 10:38.531
Malia, please go the other way.

10:38.565 --> 10:40.299
What is that? What is beeping?

10:42.436 --> 10:44.047
The car's telling you
not to run into the tree.

10:44.071 --> 10:45.838
Turn the wheel. Malia!

10:49.109 --> 10:50.509
And try to stay on the actual road.

10:56.016 --> 10:57.183
Okay, sure.

10:57.217 --> 10:58.337
Uh, this is called a U-turn.

10:58.752 --> 10:59.832
You said, "Turn the wheel."

11:03.824 --> 11:06.592
Maybe you should press a
little harder on the gas...

11:07.027 --> 11:08.261
Whoa!

11:10.964 --> 11:12.098
Okay, just turn up here.

11:12.699 --> 11:14.019
No, no, no, slowly, slowly.

11:14.935 --> 11:15.935
Go.

11:21.141 --> 11:22.842
Anybody want to tell me where we're going?

11:22.876 --> 11:26.245
The school. We can finish with
parking practice in the lot.

11:30.717 --> 11:32.618
Lydia, we're actually heading downtown.

11:34.421 --> 11:35.521
What?

11:36.023 --> 11:38.435
If we want to go to the school we
should do a U-turn. Shouldn't we?

11:38.459 --> 11:39.459
No.

11:42.129 --> 11:43.696
Keep going.

11:43.730 --> 11:44.730
You sure?

11:45.466 --> 11:46.632
Yes.

11:50.838 --> 11:51.838
We're almost there.

12:14.294 --> 12:15.294
Call 911.

12:28.142 --> 12:29.142
Boys.

12:29.977 --> 12:32.912
Scott, you saw this kid, Donovan. He...

12:33.147 --> 12:34.313
He wasn't like you, right?

12:35.249 --> 12:36.516
I don't think so.

12:36.550 --> 12:38.117
Unless he knows how to hide his scent.

12:38.152 --> 12:39.218
Well, human or otherwise,

12:40.087 --> 12:41.954
this kid might have
just murdered his lawyer

12:41.989 --> 12:43.356
and mortally wounded two officers.

12:44.458 --> 12:46.359
We've got an APB out on him, but

12:46.393 --> 12:47.753
you think you can find him faster?

12:48.128 --> 12:49.195
I can try.

12:50.397 --> 12:52.498
All right. Keep it on channel two.

13:07.014 --> 13:08.381
Dad, what if it wasn't Donovan?

13:10.517 --> 13:12.518
I'm guessing you've already got a theory?

13:13.020 --> 13:14.053
Yeah, I think I do.

13:40.013 --> 13:41.814
- Scott, is that you?
- Yeah, I found Donovan.

13:41.848 --> 13:42.959
He's completely freaked out.

13:42.983 --> 13:44.050
He keeps saying some name.

13:44.451 --> 13:46.052
What name? Theo.

13:47.554 --> 13:49.288
Tracy. He keeps saying Tracy.

13:49.323 --> 13:50.556
Tracy who?

13:51.491 --> 13:52.525
Stewart.

13:55.162 --> 13:56.162
Tracy Stewart.

14:01.690 --> 14:03.858
Tracy wasn't just having trouble sleeping.

14:03.892 --> 14:05.993
It was a real disorder.
It was night terrors.

14:06.027 --> 14:07.238
Well, now she's the night terror.

14:07.262 --> 14:08.673
Especially since no one can find her.

14:08.697 --> 14:10.798
Okay, I know we're all
tired and miserable...

14:13.001 --> 14:14.201
Except for you.

14:14.970 --> 14:15.970
Oh. I'm sorry.

14:16.271 --> 14:18.205
This is all just mind-blowing.

14:19.941 --> 14:20.941
You're a Kitsune.

14:22.544 --> 14:24.111
I don't even know what that is.

14:24.913 --> 14:25.913
I'm still learning.

14:25.947 --> 14:27.024
Liam, we said you could tell him.

14:27.048 --> 14:28.326
Not invite him to the inner circle.

14:28.350 --> 14:30.050
Uh, I'm in the inner circle?

14:30.085 --> 14:31.062
No.

14:31.086 --> 14:32.386
Guys, look, back to Tracy.

14:32.420 --> 14:34.155
She's just one lone wolf.

14:34.189 --> 14:35.289
We can find her.

14:35.323 --> 14:36.483
One lone serial-killing wolf.

14:36.725 --> 14:38.792
Uh, she only killed one person, you know.

14:38.827 --> 14:40.094
The other two were mauled.

14:40.595 --> 14:42.315
All right, what do we do when we catch her?

14:43.231 --> 14:44.265
I say we put her down.

14:50.472 --> 14:51.505
Intense.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.808
Guys, let's concentrate
on catching her first.

14:56.044 --> 14:57.324
We'll figure out the rest later.

15:01.550 --> 15:02.783
I want my lawyer.

15:04.886 --> 15:05.886
Your lawyer's dead.

15:09.858 --> 15:10.991
I want another lawyer.

15:12.394 --> 15:13.794
I know you saw something.

15:15.997 --> 15:17.398
Tracy killed her father

15:17.432 --> 15:18.999
and badly wounded two officers.

15:19.901 --> 15:21.769
One girl against three grown men.

15:22.971 --> 15:23.971
No matter

15:25.040 --> 15:27.374
how unbelievable you
think it's going to sound,

15:30.912 --> 15:32.246
I promise you can tell me.

15:33.181 --> 15:34.782
I like that tone of voice, Sheriff.

15:35.250 --> 15:36.317
It's nice.

15:37.219 --> 15:39.520
Makes you seem like
someone who wants to help.

15:50.265 --> 15:54.268
I want a new lawyer.

16:04.145 --> 16:06.505
I've got an answer to why we
couldn't find Tracy last night.

16:06.881 --> 16:08.148
She was in the hospital.

16:08.984 --> 16:09.984
Doing what?

16:10.485 --> 16:11.986
Killing her psychiatrist.

16:17.959 --> 16:19.093
Let Scott know,

16:19.127 --> 16:21.428
but tell him I don't want
them getting into it yet.

16:22.230 --> 16:23.950
Shouldn't we be putting him on the payroll?

16:26.067 --> 16:27.301
I'm starting to wonder.

16:30.238 --> 16:32.273
Now, I wanted to show you first, but

16:32.307 --> 16:33.841
considering my lack of self-control...

16:34.442 --> 16:35.509
My mother did this?

16:36.144 --> 16:37.211
Yeah.

16:37.712 --> 16:39.680
Yeah. Braeden said these guys were bad.

16:40.649 --> 16:41.915
You know, really bad.

16:41.950 --> 16:43.017
So they deserved it?

16:44.686 --> 16:47.855
Yeah, I'm not sure anyone
deserves that, per Se.

16:50.158 --> 16:51.692
I guess we know one thing now.

16:55.597 --> 16:57.031
She's good at her job.

17:03.305 --> 17:05.065
Nice to see where your
priorities are, Scott.

17:06.407 --> 17:08.442
Since you have such a
good grasp of the subject,

17:08.476 --> 17:09.910
how about you lead us in a review

17:09.944 --> 17:11.111
of last night's reading.

17:13.682 --> 17:14.948
Uh... Sure.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.457
Scott?

17:23.791 --> 17:26.126
Sorry, just looking for the page.

17:33.101 --> 17:34.101
Scott?

17:34.402 --> 17:35.502
Yeah, one sec. Sorry.

17:36.438 --> 17:37.538
Scott...

17:44.212 --> 17:45.412
She's here.

17:46.047 --> 17:47.581
She's in History class right now.

17:48.149 --> 17:49.316
Tracy.

17:49.351 --> 17:50.351
She's here.

18:47.195 --> 18:48.195
Hey.

18:49.597 --> 18:50.831
Are you all right?

18:55.937 --> 18:57.805
Are you even supposed to be in this class?

19:07.282 --> 19:09.817
No rushing, please. I'm
sure it's just a drill.

19:15.223 --> 19:16.824
Hey, we need to go.

19:20.528 --> 19:21.628
Are you all right?

19:38.746 --> 19:39.813
Tracy.

19:42.851 --> 19:43.917
Tracy.

19:54.495 --> 19:55.529
Tracy.

20:01.903 --> 20:04.705
Tracy, let go. Tracy.

20:04.739 --> 20:06.106
Hey, you're hurting me.

20:08.610 --> 20:09.610
Tracy, let her go.

20:09.878 --> 20:10.911
They're coming.

20:16.551 --> 20:17.951
They're coming for all of us.

20:41.042 --> 20:42.762
She wasn't even supposed
to be in our class.

20:43.811 --> 20:44.978
Where are they taking her?

20:48.650 --> 20:49.650
The hospital, I guess.

20:54.022 --> 20:55.862
Do you need help getting
to the Nurse's Office?

20:56.724 --> 20:57.724
I think I'll make it.

21:16.544 --> 21:17.788
They're taking her to the Animal Clinic?

21:17.812 --> 21:19.590
Yeah, to see if Deaton can
figure out what's wrong with her.

21:19.614 --> 21:21.882
What's wrong with her is
that she killed two people.

21:21.916 --> 21:24.318
Her father and, according
to Parrish, her psychiatrist.

21:24.352 --> 21:26.253
Isn't there anyone else we can talk to?

21:26.287 --> 21:28.188
Does she still have her mom? Any family?

21:29.657 --> 21:30.691
Alpha.

21:31.259 --> 21:34.361
If she's a werewolf,
she has an Alpha, right?

21:36.264 --> 21:38.264
Anyone know if a new one's
moved into Beacon Hills?

21:39.434 --> 21:41.335
No, but there's an old one.

21:41.703 --> 21:42.803
One of the oldest.

21:43.571 --> 21:44.571
We know her.

21:45.740 --> 21:46.873
And her pack.

22:05.693 --> 22:06.860
So, he's a werewolf too?

22:07.428 --> 22:08.428
Yup.

22:10.798 --> 22:12.399
This just gets better and better.

22:17.772 --> 22:19.973
Pupils dilate under normal conditions.

22:23.578 --> 22:24.678
Heart rate is 250.

22:31.886 --> 22:34.321
Evidence of an allogeneic skin graft

22:34.355 --> 22:35.689
on the right shoulder.

22:36.791 --> 22:39.292
Now, this silvery substance at her lips

22:39.327 --> 22:40.560
is not something I've seen.

22:41.696 --> 22:43.063
It almost looks like mercury.

22:45.933 --> 22:47.277
Can't you just give
her a shot of something?

22:47.301 --> 22:48.935
She doesn't look to be in any pain.

22:48.970 --> 22:50.437
I meant a shot to kill her.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.441
I generally prescribe to a code of ethics

22:54.475 --> 22:56.109
that frowns on such measures.

22:56.144 --> 22:57.944
Malia, you know we're not going to do that.

22:57.979 --> 22:59.699
How do you know she's not going to kill us?

22:59.947 --> 23:00.981
She makes a decent point.

23:01.749 --> 23:02.893
Either way, eventually
I'm going to have to let

23:02.917 --> 23:04.351
my dad know she's here.

23:04.752 --> 23:05.752
Agreed.

23:06.421 --> 23:08.555
And while I may argue against euthanasia,

23:09.090 --> 23:10.290
I'm not opposed to a little...

23:12.960 --> 23:14.327
Extra security.

23:26.649 --> 23:27.649
Hold on.

23:27.684 --> 23:29.518
Isn't this like a crime scene or something?

23:29.552 --> 23:30.552
No.

23:33.923 --> 23:35.024
Maybe.

23:35.825 --> 23:36.825
Don't worry about it.

23:38.495 --> 23:40.596
Okay, so what are we looking for?

23:41.798 --> 23:42.865
I am not sure.

23:44.234 --> 23:46.368
I'm mostly just following a feeling.

23:48.538 --> 23:50.218
Your feelings usually lead to dead bodies.

23:52.542 --> 23:53.902
Well, let me know if you find one.

24:06.890 --> 24:08.023
Don't worry, Stiles.

24:08.525 --> 24:10.102
Tracy won't be able to
cross a line of Mountain Ash.

24:10.126 --> 24:11.393
She's not going anywhere.

24:13.029 --> 24:14.897
Yeah, that's kind of what I'm afraid of.

24:15.298 --> 24:17.733
Well, you and I will be able
to get out of here no problem.

24:19.169 --> 24:21.403
You two. Not so much.

24:28.611 --> 24:29.611
Weird.

24:30.513 --> 24:32.581
Scott, would you mind holding her down.

24:33.850 --> 24:36.418
I'm going to be trying a
few more invasive tests.

25:02.112 --> 25:03.752
I think you're gonna need a bigger blade.

25:10.220 --> 25:12.187
Cute. But never seen her.

25:14.724 --> 25:16.758
Could Satomi have turned
her without you knowing?

25:17.727 --> 25:18.760
After the dead pool,

25:18.795 --> 25:20.629
Satomi's not exactly doing much recruiting.

25:21.931 --> 25:23.031
That's how it works?

25:23.867 --> 25:26.201
Alpha werewolves just
go around biting people?

25:26.402 --> 25:28.537
Or you can be born, like me and my sister.

25:28.571 --> 25:30.606
Satomi took us in after
our family died in a fire.

25:33.343 --> 25:36.211
Guys, I think I just found something.

25:55.131 --> 25:56.365
Hey, look at this.

25:58.101 --> 25:59.301
"Remember, TracyBear,"

25:59.736 --> 26:01.203
"it only works if you believe it."

26:01.671 --> 26:02.671
"Hope this helps."

26:03.039 --> 26:04.173
"Love, Dad."

26:04.774 --> 26:06.008
This is beyond depressing.

26:06.876 --> 26:08.143
He was just trying to help her.

26:08.678 --> 26:10.158
Why would she go after him like that?

26:10.580 --> 26:13.348
I guess she wasn't in control of herself.

26:13.983 --> 26:15.223
But it wasn't even a full moon.

26:15.685 --> 26:17.805
Maybe a werewolf with night
terrors is worse than a...

26:21.157 --> 26:22.090
You know,

26:22.125 --> 26:23.959
there are cases of people

26:24.727 --> 26:26.695
who accidentally murdered
their entire family

26:26.729 --> 26:28.030
while in a night terror.

26:29.799 --> 26:31.319
They had no idea what they were doing.

26:32.669 --> 26:34.903
It's called a homicidal somnambulism.

26:34.938 --> 26:36.238
So if Tracy's killing people

26:36.272 --> 26:37.552
she doesn't really want to kill,

26:38.975 --> 26:40.375
she might not actually be awake.

26:43.346 --> 26:44.813
She's still in a night terror.

26:54.891 --> 26:55.891
Now, this is interesting.

27:03.166 --> 27:04.233
What's up?

27:04.267 --> 27:05.634
It's my mom.

27:05.668 --> 27:07.379
It's about the driver
of the prison transport.

27:07.403 --> 27:08.843
She's saying he's awake and talking.

27:17.347 --> 27:18.827
Malia, help me turn her over, please.

27:23.519 --> 27:25.254
Driver didn't have stroke or heart attack.

27:25.288 --> 27:27.356
Says it was more like
his body just locked up...

27:28.124 --> 27:29.124
Like he was paralyzed.

27:33.129 --> 27:34.209
I think I know what she is.

27:34.597 --> 27:36.198
Do you care to enlighten the rest of us?

27:36.399 --> 27:38.267
Because this doesn't look too good.

28:52.275 --> 28:53.375
It wasn't a werewolf.

28:55.044 --> 28:56.044
Kanima.

29:01.545 --> 29:04.025
Hey, Deaton, how the hell did
she get through the Mountain Ash?

29:04.281 --> 29:05.681
I don't know.

29:05.716 --> 29:08.094
It's a barrier no supernatural
creature should be able to cross.

29:08.118 --> 29:09.152
Scott did it.

29:09.186 --> 29:11.087
Once, but it almost killed me.

29:11.288 --> 29:12.455
We should've killed her.

29:12.956 --> 29:15.135
Meanwhile, she's probably on
her way to killing someone else.

29:15.159 --> 29:17.794
Listen, everyone. We need to concentrate.

29:18.462 --> 29:19.495
Scott and Malia,

29:20.130 --> 29:22.198
you two will probably be able to move

29:22.232 --> 29:23.800
long before Stiles and I can.

29:23.834 --> 29:24.901
But you need to focus.

29:25.302 --> 29:26.335
Focus on what?

29:26.370 --> 29:27.437
Healing.

29:27.471 --> 29:28.571
That's right.

29:29.873 --> 29:31.513
I don't know how to tell my body to heal.

29:31.542 --> 29:32.975
Malia, calm down. It's okay...

29:33.010 --> 29:34.510
I can't calm down. I can't move.

29:34.545 --> 29:36.265
It won't last long. We're going to be okay.

29:36.980 --> 29:38.047
Doc, how do we focus?

29:38.916 --> 29:39.916
Think of a body part.

29:40.484 --> 29:42.351
Your hands, your feet,

29:43.353 --> 29:44.821
even just the tips of your fingers.

29:45.289 --> 29:46.489
Imagine them moving.

29:47.291 --> 29:49.592
See it in your mind and
your body will follow.

30:01.438 --> 30:02.371
Sure you know where you're going?

30:02.406 --> 30:03.606
I know where I am.

30:06.076 --> 30:08.444
So do I. Middle of nowhere.

30:10.581 --> 30:11.614
Guys?

30:21.258 --> 30:22.258
I think I found it.

30:24.194 --> 30:25.194
See the necklace?

30:31.235 --> 30:32.235
No, I don't see it.

30:40.210 --> 30:41.410
Liam, I...

30:41.678 --> 30:43.279
I thought you said this was a sinkhole.

30:43.580 --> 30:45.047
It's a hole. What's the difference?

30:45.349 --> 30:46.883
I mean, look at all these handprints

30:46.917 --> 30:48.251
and look at all this dirt.

30:50.387 --> 30:51.587
She didn't fall in here.

30:54.158 --> 30:55.158
She was buried.

30:57.928 --> 30:58.928
Intense.

31:01.265 --> 31:02.265
Okay.

31:03.133 --> 31:04.933
I'm pretty sure I just
felt my right leg move.

31:06.370 --> 31:07.603
Uh, yep, definitely felt it.

31:08.071 --> 31:09.739
Like a twinge, spasm, something.

31:13.277 --> 31:14.477
I'm going to have to disagree.

31:14.511 --> 31:16.245
And I think I hold an informed opinion.

31:21.552 --> 31:22.585
Malia.

31:23.820 --> 31:25.254
I don't think she cut me that deep.

31:25.289 --> 31:26.289
Keep going.

31:27.257 --> 31:28.257
Keep moving.

31:38.702 --> 31:40.182
What's happening? I can't see.

31:46.376 --> 31:47.376
What's happening?

31:54.418 --> 31:56.285
Malia? Malia, wait for us.

31:57.287 --> 31:58.354
There's no time.

31:58.388 --> 31:59.622
Look, she's not a werewolf.

32:00.257 --> 32:01.791
But she has a scent. I can find her.

32:02.159 --> 32:03.226
Malia.

32:04.261 --> 32:05.261
Save her.

32:14.238 --> 32:15.238
Okay, wait a second.

32:15.272 --> 32:17.073
Her dad was just trying to help her, right?

32:17.641 --> 32:19.242
So was her psychiatrist.

32:19.276 --> 32:21.310
And maybe that's why she was at the school.

32:21.345 --> 32:22.589
She was looking for someone else

32:22.613 --> 32:24.313
who was just trying to help.

32:24.348 --> 32:25.581
Yeah, and... Oh,

32:26.049 --> 32:27.049
maybe it was you?

32:29.219 --> 32:30.253
Or not.

32:30.287 --> 32:33.222
Since that would mean
she wants to kill you.

32:33.257 --> 32:35.591
No, you're right.

32:37.227 --> 32:39.428
I was trying to help. But...

32:39.463 --> 32:41.097
So was someone else.

32:42.666 --> 32:43.933
My mother.

32:45.302 --> 32:47.403
What if Tracy went to the
school looking for her?

32:48.472 --> 32:49.472
Where is she now?

32:51.275 --> 32:52.341
On a date.

32:52.809 --> 32:55.044
Thanks for meeting me
here, it's been a hectic day

32:55.078 --> 32:56.145
at the station.

32:56.179 --> 32:57.680
I probably shouldn't even be...

32:59.116 --> 33:01.017
Well, I'm glad you didn't
have to cancel again.

33:02.286 --> 33:03.519
Me too.

33:11.128 --> 33:12.194
Clark?

33:17.434 --> 33:18.634
What the hell are you doing?

33:19.169 --> 33:20.303
I can't move.

33:29.680 --> 33:30.980
Mom, she's coming.

33:32.649 --> 33:34.183
Tracy's coming for you.

33:34.217 --> 33:35.318
What?

33:35.619 --> 33:36.652
What do you mean for me?

34:02.579 --> 34:03.846
Why isn't it here?

34:03.880 --> 34:06.315
She probably came back for it.

34:10.920 --> 34:12.521
I don't think this is the one.

34:14.558 --> 34:15.558
What do you mean?

34:15.592 --> 34:17.659
It was closer to the bridge. Much closer.

34:20.530 --> 34:21.931
This is a different hole.

34:22.466 --> 34:24.166
Then who crawled out of this one?

34:49.559 --> 34:50.993
Kira, look out!

35:12.782 --> 35:14.283
Mom, run! Run!

35:19.823 --> 35:21.223
No!

35:26.429 --> 35:27.496
Lydia!

35:27.531 --> 35:28.964
Lydia!

36:19.816 --> 36:20.816
How did you find us?

36:20.850 --> 36:22.017
'Cause you work here.

36:22.052 --> 36:23.892
I heard about Tracy,
I've been looking for you.

36:29.859 --> 36:31.493
We lost her.

36:31.695 --> 36:32.861
And Malia.

36:32.896 --> 36:34.129
I can help.

36:39.769 --> 36:40.936
This is Theo?

36:41.438 --> 36:42.638
Let me help.

36:44.274 --> 36:46.308
It doesn't have to mean
I'm part of the pack.

36:46.643 --> 36:48.563
Or like you've accepted
me or anything like that.

36:49.746 --> 36:51.447
It just means I can help catch this girl.

37:00.590 --> 37:01.590
Scott.

37:03.493 --> 37:04.627
I can help you.

37:15.071 --> 37:16.171
Careful...

37:16.773 --> 37:17.773
Malia...

37:21.678 --> 37:22.678
Lydia? Okay.

37:23.480 --> 37:25.180
Hey, it's not as bad as it looks.

37:25.782 --> 37:26.915
Malia.

37:26.950 --> 37:28.751
Listen... Tracy...

37:29.619 --> 37:31.987
She thinks... She thinks she's asleep.

37:32.022 --> 37:33.689
She thinks she's dreaming.

37:33.890 --> 37:35.124
It's a night terror.

37:35.625 --> 37:36.636
I... I don't know what that...

37:36.660 --> 37:39.361
She... She's not
dreaming. She's not asleep.

37:40.797 --> 37:42.531
Get her to understand.

37:43.033 --> 37:44.199
Malia!

37:45.402 --> 37:47.936
Basement. They're in the basement.

37:48.505 --> 37:49.505
They?

37:50.040 --> 37:52.541
Tracy... And my mother.

39:41.885 --> 39:43.152
Tracy?

39:44.788 --> 39:45.921
Tracy.

39:46.289 --> 39:47.523
No, no, no. Look at me.

39:48.992 --> 39:50.626
You're not dreaming.

39:51.728 --> 39:54.129
This is real. All... All this is real.

39:57.267 --> 39:59.668
You get it? You get that?

40:02.105 --> 40:03.505
You're not dreaming, Tracy.

40:03.940 --> 40:05.174
What...

40:06.142 --> 40:07.676
What's happening to me?

40:28.365 --> 40:30.111
Terminal.
