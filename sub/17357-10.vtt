00:06.367 --> 00:07.899
Camomile: Previously on Deadbeat...

00:07.900 --> 00:09.237
All right, try it now.

00:09.238 --> 00:11.311
Testies, testies, one, two, three.

00:11.312 --> 00:12.781
Ha!

00:12.782 --> 00:14.888
Are you seeing any ghosts right now?

00:14.889 --> 00:16.093
No.

00:16.094 --> 00:18.800
Sue? The recording.

00:18.801 --> 00:20.473
- Hit play.
- (On laptop): Have you ever

00:20.474 --> 00:22.179
seen a ghost in your life? Kevin: No.

00:22.180 --> 00:23.985
I have never seen a ghost.

00:23.986 --> 00:26.895
Your business is finished.

00:28.232 --> 00:29.502
Go on, get out of here.

00:29.503 --> 00:31.107
- (Whimpering)
- You too, Blob.

00:31.108 --> 00:33.481
- (Continues whimpering)
- Just go.

00:33.482 --> 00:35.488
Mrs. White, please, I
have to confess something.

00:35.489 --> 00:37.093
I believe in Kevin.

00:37.094 --> 00:39.335
I think there's
something else in this cave.

00:39.336 --> 00:40.404
Something powerful.

00:42.244 --> 00:44.518
(Screaming)

00:48.899 --> 00:50.871
Roofie: What do you mean
you're done with ghosts?

00:50.872 --> 00:52.175
I mean, I'm finished with them.

00:52.176 --> 00:53.947
Look, I know what the word means.

00:53.948 --> 00:55.151
Well, then why did you ask?

00:55.152 --> 00:56.455
I know you lost your subway job,

00:56.456 --> 00:58.194
but come on, man,
there's gonna be others.

00:58.195 --> 01:01.104
It's not the job. You don't get it, Roofie.

01:01.105 --> 01:02.977
I finally had a chance to prove

01:02.978 --> 01:04.515
that I, a real medium,

01:04.516 --> 01:07.323
was better at ghosts than
Camomile White, a fake medium,

01:07.324 --> 01:09.263
and I still somehow managed to lose.

01:09.264 --> 01:11.169
Look, you can't
just be done, all right?

01:11.170 --> 01:13.177
You have a rare gift
that-that helps people.

01:13.178 --> 01:15.116
Well, it's the stupidest gift ever.

01:15.117 --> 01:16.921
Why can't I just be a regular old

01:16.922 --> 01:19.129
newsstand operator like
everybody else in this city?

01:19.130 --> 01:21.268
A regular newsstand...
What are you talking...?

01:21.269 --> 01:24.312
You know what, I'm not gonna
let you squander this gift.

01:24.313 --> 01:26.218
You know what, if you
wanna operate my newsstand,

01:26.219 --> 01:28.124
you gonna have to put
the ghost sign back up.

01:29.529 --> 01:31.970
- Slam dunk!
- Okay, fine.

01:31.971 --> 01:34.009
Okay, now...

01:34.010 --> 01:36.351
I quit. What?

01:36.352 --> 01:37.587
I don't have to be a newsie, Roofie.

01:37.588 --> 01:39.226
There are lots of other jobs

01:39.227 --> 01:41.300
that I could try, I just
haven't tried them yet.

01:41.301 --> 01:43.473
And I won't have to deal
with stinking fart-faced ghosts

01:43.474 --> 01:45.513
all day either! You'll see.

01:45.514 --> 01:47.586
- You'll all see!
- Pac!

01:47.587 --> 01:50.397
It'll be anarchy! Hello,
world, meet Kevin Pacalioglu.

01:51.501 --> 01:53.171
Come back.

02:32.030 --> 02:33.503
Did you find anything?

02:33.504 --> 02:35.279
No, Paul. I haven't found squat.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.618
All of these books are just rubbish.

02:36.619 --> 02:38.060
Most of them are ghost erotica.

02:39.198 --> 02:40.504
- You wrote them.
- (Sighs)

02:40.505 --> 02:41.844
I've made a career

02:41.845 --> 02:44.223
out of exploiting people
who believed in ghosts,

02:44.224 --> 02:45.864
and now it seems there really are ghosts

02:45.865 --> 02:47.739
and I've just been living a lie!

02:47.740 --> 02:49.883
I just don't see the big
deal. Your fans think that you

02:49.884 --> 02:52.262
have always believed in ghosts,
and now if you actually do,

02:52.263 --> 02:54.640
maybe you'll just be able
to, you know, do your job better.

02:54.641 --> 02:57.353
Oh, my God, you're right.

02:57.354 --> 02:59.698
- (Chuckles)
- I'll just be even more convincing.

02:59.699 --> 03:03.650
I can use that feeling that I
had in the tunnel at anytime

03:03.651 --> 03:05.459
and whenever I need to go som...

03:05.460 --> 03:08.307
- (Dramatic theme playing)
- The tunnel.

03:08.308 --> 03:10.284
- What?
- Whatever it was

03:10.285 --> 03:12.328
that killed Sue down there...

03:13.534 --> 03:15.209
is still down there.

03:16.816 --> 03:18.993
They start construction again tomorrow.

03:18.994 --> 03:20.869
Oh, my God, all those innocent people...

03:20.870 --> 03:22.611
- My career.
- What?

03:22.612 --> 03:24.855
I gave the stamp of
approval on that tunnel.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.330
I gave them the all-clear,

03:26.331 --> 03:27.937
I said the ghost had gone.

03:27.938 --> 03:31.722
If anybody else dies, my
career will be destroyed.

03:31.723 --> 03:34.335
- What are you gonna do?
- Well, I'm gonna get rid of the ghost.

03:34.336 --> 03:37.282
- (Stammering): Do you know how to do that?
- No.

03:37.283 --> 03:39.695
But I know someone who does.

The whole industry is just
too throat-cutty for me.

05:06.712 --> 05:09.436
Hey, can I confide something inside you?

05:09.437 --> 05:11.263
I don't even like ghosts. I don't,

05:11.264 --> 05:12.924
I don't like them. I can't
believe I'm saying that.

05:12.925 --> 05:14.684
They're just, they're so needy.

05:14.685 --> 05:16.844
They're only friends with
me because they want something.

05:16.845 --> 05:18.372
Because they know I can hear them.

05:18.373 --> 05:19.701
And then I inevitably get attached,

05:19.702 --> 05:21.495
and they abandon me for
that stinking light.

05:21.496 --> 05:23.421
And the question is, do I really need that?

05:23.422 --> 05:25.780
The answer is no, I don't.

05:25.781 --> 05:28.771
(Speaking in Spanish)

05:30.664 --> 05:32.490
Kevin: I hear you, brother.

05:32.491 --> 05:34.217
I don't get what you're
saying, but I hear ya.

05:34.218 --> 05:35.912
I hear all of you, you
guys are my new family.

05:35.913 --> 05:37.740
And I will take care of you no matter what,

05:37.741 --> 05:39.799
just as long as you stay alive,
for as long as I'm alive.

05:39.800 --> 05:42.324
Just don't go turning into
a bunch of ghost jackasses...

05:42.325 --> 05:43.486
Ah!

05:48.270 --> 05:49.532
Someone will clean that up, right?

05:49.533 --> 05:52.123
- Si.
- You will.

05:52.124 --> 05:53.684
Oh.

05:53.685 --> 05:55.380
You speak English? Si.

06:05.145 --> 06:06.706
(Creaking)

06:06.707 --> 06:08.468
Herro?

06:11.491 --> 06:12.570
Somebody there?

06:15.152 --> 06:16.589
Blob, is that you?

06:16.590 --> 06:19.171
Cause I'm pretty sure
I banished you, buddy.

06:19.172 --> 06:20.968
(Ghostly murmuring)

06:20.969 --> 06:23.778
Okay, that better be somebody
living, like a robber

06:23.779 --> 06:26.230
or a murderer, because I am so done with...

06:28.681 --> 06:29.759
Sue...

06:30.969 --> 06:33.060
(Giggles): You can see me.

06:39.759 --> 06:41.752
Oh, my God, Sue, you're...

06:41.753 --> 06:43.092
you're dead, what happened?

06:43.093 --> 06:45.380
You were right, the subway...

06:45.381 --> 06:46.654
there's something else down there.

06:46.655 --> 06:48.288
- Yeah.
- I was with Camomile,

06:48.289 --> 06:49.661
cleaning up after the séance,

06:49.662 --> 06:52.308
and this monster killed me.

06:52.309 --> 06:53.550
A monster?

06:53.551 --> 06:54.726
I didn't get a good look at it,

06:54.727 --> 06:56.458
but it was big. Huge teeth.

06:56.459 --> 06:58.289
Stabbed me right in the heart.

06:58.290 --> 07:00.216
Well, at least it didn't
stab you right in the back.

07:00.217 --> 07:02.536
Well, it did because it
went through my chest

07:02.537 --> 07:04.171
and then out through my back.

07:04.172 --> 07:05.543
No, you stabbed me in the back.

07:05.544 --> 07:07.177
You stabbed me in the
back. You betrayed me.

07:07.178 --> 07:09.008
The whole drunk at the
bar. That was just a big,

07:09.009 --> 07:10.870
elaborate ruse so you
could go tell Camomile

07:10.871 --> 07:12.243
about the subway job.

07:12.244 --> 07:14.857
No, I know it looks bad,
but it wasn't a set-up.

07:14.858 --> 07:16.132
Ah, I don't believe you.

07:16.133 --> 07:17.864
Please, Kevin, that night we had,

07:17.865 --> 07:20.739
it was real, I swear. But when I got home,

07:20.740 --> 07:22.472
Camomile was waiting for me.

07:22.473 --> 07:26.066
And she forced it out of me.
You know how scary she can be.

07:26.067 --> 07:29.498
I tried to cover, but...

07:29.499 --> 07:30.706
I'm sorry.

07:30.707 --> 07:32.897
I ruined everything for us.

07:32.898 --> 07:35.608
I shouldn't have asked,
I'll just be a ghost forever.

07:35.609 --> 07:37.733
You don't ruin everything.

07:37.734 --> 07:39.432
It's just, like uh!

07:39.433 --> 07:42.081
You know? What are you asking
me for, what do you need?

07:43.421 --> 07:45.707
My body is still in the tunnel.

07:45.708 --> 07:49.624
I can't move into my light
until my body is buried at sea.

07:49.924 --> 07:52.014
Your body's buried at sea? Isn't it...

07:52.015 --> 07:54.106
No, doesn't matter. That's fine.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.381
I'll do it. I'll help you.

07:55.382 --> 07:57.930
- Really?
- As long as you leave me alone.

07:57.931 --> 07:59.270
Okay, just leave me alone.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.164
I can't deal with
any more emotions today.

08:01.165 --> 08:02.930
I'm getting emotion sickness.

08:02.931 --> 08:04.107
(Speaking softly): Okay.

08:08.846 --> 08:09.924
Kevin: You smell really bad.

08:11.231 --> 08:13.027
I-I really wish I didn't eat that

08:13.028 --> 08:14.760
pulled pork sandwich earlier. Unh...

08:14.761 --> 08:16.132
Sue: I think we should probably hurry.

08:16.133 --> 08:18.028
What... Oh. You know what, Sue?

08:18.029 --> 08:20.544
I'm not afraid of this "monster"
you're talking about, okay?

08:20.544 --> 08:22.963
I've seen just about everything
there is to see in this world.

08:22.964 --> 08:25.250
No, it's just you're picking up body parts

08:25.251 --> 08:27.309
and if someone walked in, it
wouldn't look so good.

08:27.310 --> 08:29.335
Oh, right.

08:29.336 --> 08:31.688
Yeah, point taken.

08:31.689 --> 08:34.596
God, you're everywhere.

08:34.597 --> 08:38.605
Mm. I'm sorry I didn't die
in a more convenient way.

08:38.606 --> 08:40.142
It doesn't even matter, honestly.

08:40.143 --> 08:43.116
- Why?
- Because, this is my last job.

08:43.118 --> 08:46.157
After the Camomile
ridicule session down here,

08:46.158 --> 08:47.495
I decided I'm giving up the ghost.

08:47.496 --> 08:49.265
What do you mean?

08:49.266 --> 08:52.140
It's a figment of speech,
Sue. It means to quit, okay?

08:52.141 --> 08:53.677
- You can't quit.
- Yes, I can.

08:53.678 --> 08:55.414
What about all those ghosts out there?

08:55.415 --> 08:57.419
- That's not my problem.
- Kevin, these are tortured souls

08:57.420 --> 08:58.789
with no one to turn to.

08:58.790 --> 09:00.327
You're the only one who can help them.

09:00.328 --> 09:01.730
I don't want to get into it, okay, Sue?

09:01.731 --> 09:04.403
You should just be
counting your stars lucky

09:04.404 --> 09:06.108
that I'm even helping you, all right?

09:06.109 --> 09:07.478
Uh...

09:07.479 --> 09:09.517
(Dramatic theme playing)

09:09.518 --> 09:11.287
Oh, my God, look. I think that's it.

09:11.288 --> 09:12.391
That's it?

09:14.196 --> 09:17.369
Run! De-materialize! Go! Oh, oh crap!

09:17.370 --> 09:19.575
(Yelling indistinctly)

09:19.576 --> 09:21.513
(Growling)

09:21.514 --> 09:23.485
Ah, what the hell was that?

09:23.486 --> 09:25.255
I have no idea. What, wait...

09:25.256 --> 09:27.695
- How do you not know?
- How I not know what?

09:27.696 --> 09:31.237
No, uh, sorry, sir. Not-not
talking to you. Sorry.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.443
(Whispers): How-how did you not see it?

09:33.444 --> 09:35.448
I freaked out, give me a
break. I only died yesterday.

09:35.449 --> 09:37.185
(Normal voice): I know that your instincts

09:37.186 --> 09:39.625
are still human, but you're
not human anymore, okay?

09:39.626 --> 09:40.862
You barely even exist!

09:40.863 --> 09:44.136
Hey, buddy, I only try to do my job.

09:44.137 --> 09:46.743
Yeah, I'm sorry,
again. Not addressing you.

09:46.744 --> 09:49.316
Look, Mmmikh-Mikkhaa...

09:49.317 --> 09:51.355
it says Michael. That
doesn't say Michael.

09:51.356 --> 09:52.491
The h is silent.

09:52.492 --> 09:54.296
Michael.

09:55.666 --> 09:56.868
Yeah.

09:56.869 --> 09:59.209
(Down tempo theme playing)

10:10.337 --> 10:11.606
See what I did there?

10:11.607 --> 10:13.352
Sue: I guess chivalry is not dead.

10:13.353 --> 10:15.485
No, no. Just you. Ha, ha.

10:15.486 --> 10:17.392
Too soon? Little bit?

10:17.393 --> 10:19.947
Kevin (Chuckling): It's
never too soon for that joke.

10:19.948 --> 10:21.370
- (Giggling)
- (Sighs)

10:21.371 --> 10:23.439
Hey, ah, before we go any farther,

10:23.440 --> 10:25.411
can I just ask you, what's
with the burial at sea?

10:25.412 --> 10:27.934
It just seems like, ew.

10:27.935 --> 10:29.227
Uh, I don't know,
it's kinda private.

10:29.228 --> 10:30.746
Uh, Sue,

10:30.747 --> 10:32.265
I just picked up pieces of your lady flower

10:32.266 --> 10:33.656
off the floor of a subway tunnel.

10:33.657 --> 10:35.758
- Try me.
- Okay.

10:35.759 --> 10:38.894
When I was a kid, I used
to get picked on at school.

10:38.895 --> 10:40.316
So when I came home

10:40.317 --> 10:42.225
I would get in the
bathtub and go underwater.

10:43.874 --> 10:47.139
'cause underwater,
no one can see you cry.

10:47.140 --> 10:50.502
Well, that would've been
nice to know at the orphanage.

10:50.503 --> 10:52.345
Well...

10:52.345 --> 10:54.154
Don't you worry, Sue.

10:54.155 --> 10:57.032
We'll get you back to that
watery comfort zone asap, okay?

10:57.033 --> 10:58.196
Okay.

10:58.197 --> 10:59.942
Now, you have the bag?

10:59.943 --> 11:01.785
The bag?

11:01.786 --> 11:04.211
The cab! Oh, no! Michael!

11:08.415 --> 11:10.612
(Indistinct radio chatter)

11:10.613 --> 11:14.395
I believe I may have left
my bag in one of your cars.

11:14.396 --> 11:16.205
Could you describe it a little more please?

11:16.206 --> 11:19.342
Uh, it's like a tote-slash-duffel bag.

11:19.343 --> 11:21.023
Brown leather, supple,

11:21.024 --> 11:23.514
smells like a boot. It's
a genuine Gucci knockoff.

11:25.873 --> 11:26.779
(Silence)

11:28.201 --> 11:30.853
Oh, also, I just remembered,
it's probably

11:30.854 --> 11:32.760
sopping wet with, like,
a blood-colored liquid.

11:32.761 --> 11:35.120
We just had a bag matching that description

11:35.121 --> 11:36.543
that was actually just turned in.

11:36.544 --> 11:38.062
You did? Yeah, that's mine.

11:38.063 --> 11:39.130
Tch.

11:43.268 --> 11:45.790
Sir, would you mind describing
to me the contents of the bag?

11:45.791 --> 11:47.374
Contents?

11:47.375 --> 11:49.153
(Laughing)

11:50.996 --> 11:52.394
Do I... do I even need the bag?

11:52.395 --> 11:53.993
I didn't really like this bag.

11:53.994 --> 11:56.426
Please, Kevin. I'll be a ghost forever.

11:57.725 --> 12:00.056
Yeah, yeah... Piece of cake.

12:00.057 --> 12:01.588
Uh, there are some

12:01.589 --> 12:04.752
lady's... pieces... there.

12:04.753 --> 12:06.219
Garments?

12:06.220 --> 12:07.984
Uh, yeah, sure, those too.

12:07.985 --> 12:09.683
But mostly, though, uh...

12:09.684 --> 12:11.349
women's... parts?

12:11.350 --> 12:15.112
Like the body parts of a young woman?

12:15.113 --> 12:16.645
Sorry,

12:16.646 --> 12:19.277
I'm gonna need you to
be a little more specific.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.173
Okay, so... limbs.

12:24.174 --> 12:27.171
Pretty standard. Limbs.
Dainty but, uh, scrappy.

12:27.172 --> 12:29.269
You know, like good for hugging.

12:29.270 --> 12:31.669
There's a torso in there.
It's petite, yet womanly.

12:31.670 --> 12:34.667
Uh, two women's breasts...

12:34.668 --> 12:37.031
not the breasts from two different women,

12:37.032 --> 12:39.496
but-but, you know, two
breasts, from the same woman.

12:39.497 --> 12:42.295
They're full, yet pert.

12:42.296 --> 12:46.192
And proportional, to the
before-mentioned torso.

12:46.193 --> 12:47.957
Perfect handfuls, really.

12:47.958 --> 12:50.023
There's a face.

12:50.024 --> 12:51.955
It's, uh, a small face.

12:51.956 --> 12:54.453
A delicate flower of a face, really.

12:54.454 --> 12:57.284
No-no gashes in there or anything.

12:57.285 --> 12:59.416
Great eyes. Kind.

12:59.417 --> 13:02.548
Honest eye lashes, you
know, good-good for batting.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.978
Ears you could get lost in for days.

13:04.979 --> 13:09.044
And lips. Soft, soft pouty lips. I don't...

13:11.009 --> 13:12.507
I'm not really sure what color...

13:12.508 --> 13:16.072
Ahi red. The lipstick I
was wearing was ahi red.

13:16.073 --> 13:20.202
Ahi red lips, like the tuna.

13:20.203 --> 13:22.835
Raw, sushi-grade tuna.

13:27.398 --> 13:28.926
Ah... wait, I...

13:28.927 --> 13:30.693
(Tense theme playing)

13:31.860 --> 13:33.555
All righty. Good to go.

13:33.556 --> 13:35.321
Ah, just sign that form
and you're all set.

13:35.322 --> 13:36.887
- Really? That's it?
- Yeah.

13:36.888 --> 13:38.723
Sorry about the interrogation.

13:38.724 --> 13:40.788
You wouldn't believe how
many deadbeats come in here

13:40.789 --> 13:42.445
trying to claim stuff
that isn't theirs.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.480
- I bet.
- (Grunts)

13:44.481 --> 13:45.847
- Careful.
- Ooh.

13:45.848 --> 13:48.311
You might wanna put air
fresheners in there.

13:48.312 --> 13:50.246
Did you really mean all that?

13:50.247 --> 13:51.513
What?

13:51.514 --> 13:53.739
What you said back there. About me.

13:53.749 --> 13:55.504
Oh, uh...

13:55.505 --> 13:57.949
- Ow!
- Hello, Kevin.

13:57.950 --> 13:59.844
I hope you're not in
the middle of anything.

13:59.845 --> 14:01.281
Well, now I'm in the middle of you

14:01.282 --> 14:02.947
and this really hard wall.

14:02.948 --> 14:05.711
Now, just you listen to
me, and you listen good.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.277
I need you to go back into that tunnel

14:07.278 --> 14:08.734
and get rid of that ghost.

14:08.744 --> 14:10.669
What? Why do you suddenly care?

14:10.670 --> 14:14.427
Because construction starts
tomorrow and if that ghost kills

14:14.428 --> 14:16.205
or even maims anybody,

14:16.206 --> 14:17.782
it's my ass on the line.

14:17.783 --> 14:20.133
And if I go down, you go down.

14:20.134 --> 14:21.872
While I appreciate that visual,

14:21.873 --> 14:23.750
I'm not into you that way anymore.

14:23.751 --> 14:25.870
It was a brief moment,
we had it, it passed.

14:25.871 --> 14:26.977
Kevin, what's this?

14:28.253 --> 14:30.904
- It's a video recorder.
- Yeah...

14:30.905 --> 14:33.346
and on here is footage of you

14:33.347 --> 14:35.155
earlier in the tunnel

14:35.165 --> 14:39.052
picking up Sue's body
parts and talking to yourself.

14:39.053 --> 14:40.389
- Uh-oh.
- Ha, ha.

14:40.390 --> 14:42.438
Uh-huh, yeah, the medium that lost the job

14:42.439 --> 14:44.418
kills his rival's assistant.

14:44.419 --> 14:48.477
A story so juicy I could sell
it right here, right now.

14:48.478 --> 14:50.990
To who? To me? I can't
afford those rights.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.305
- Just...
- Ow!

14:52.306 --> 14:54.314
Get rid of the ghost.

14:54.315 --> 14:57.199
God, your finger's so pointy.

14:59.017 --> 15:02.131
Aw, Susan B. Anthony, she is intense.

15:02.132 --> 15:04.281
- She's bluffering though, right?
- I don't know.

15:04.282 --> 15:05.959
She's right about one thing though,

15:05.960 --> 15:07.998
that ghost down there is dangerous.

15:07.999 --> 15:10.149
And if you don't do
anything to get rid of it,

15:10.150 --> 15:12.158
those innocent workers are
going to be clocking in

15:12.159 --> 15:13.365
for their deaths tomorrow.

15:13.375 --> 15:14.339
(Grunts)

15:15.585 --> 15:17.725
All right, fine, fine. Yeah.

15:17.735 --> 15:18.770
Let's go, come on.

15:20.217 --> 15:22.528
(Down tempo theme playing)

15:30.214 --> 15:32.183
Okay, I'm going in.

15:32.193 --> 15:33.599
Okay, just be careful.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.804
Don't get yourself killed.

15:34.805 --> 15:37.356
I won't, but thank you.

15:37.357 --> 15:38.633
We still have to do my thing after.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.817
(Chuckling)

15:41.818 --> 15:43.927
Okay, ahem, I'm going in for reals now.

15:43.928 --> 15:45.535
Okay, and then what?

15:45.536 --> 15:46.651
And then uh...

15:47.756 --> 15:49.505
you know, and then uh...

15:50.610 --> 15:51.976
I'm in.

15:51.986 --> 15:53.623
In what? What's the plan?

15:53.624 --> 15:54.829
What are you talking about?

15:54.830 --> 15:56.908
Once I'm in here, I'm in...

15:56.909 --> 15:58.757
(Kevin screaming)

15:58.758 --> 16:00.937
Oh, fart!

16:00.938 --> 16:02.385
Uh... hey, hey!

16:03.892 --> 16:05.700
Hey! Wait! Stop! Stop
what you're doing!

16:05.701 --> 16:06.775
What, you can see me?

16:06.776 --> 16:08.453
Kevin: Yes, goddamn it!

16:08.454 --> 16:11.065
I can see you. I need you to
stop what you're doing.

16:11.066 --> 16:13.647
Put the machinery down!

16:13.648 --> 16:14.894
Put it down!

16:16.903 --> 16:18.349
Thank God.

16:18.350 --> 16:19.957
Oh, my God.

16:19.958 --> 16:21.705
I'm sorry, I didn't know you could see me.

16:21.706 --> 16:23.041
Why would that matter?

16:23.042 --> 16:25.091
It's just different when it's anonymous.

16:25.092 --> 16:27.171
Just, you stop, okay?

16:27.172 --> 16:28.979
That's insane behavior.

16:28.980 --> 16:30.657
(Sighing): Who are you?

16:30.658 --> 16:32.817
I'm Daniel L. Turner. Engineer.

16:32.818 --> 16:34.917
Why are you killing everyone?

16:34.918 --> 16:36.439
Why did you kill me?

16:36.440 --> 16:38.400
I never wanted to kill anyone.

16:38.401 --> 16:40.132
I just wanted to scare
them so they wouldn't

16:40.133 --> 16:41.238
finish the subway.

16:41.239 --> 16:42.954
Why don't you want the Second Avenue

16:42.956 --> 16:45.078
- subway line finished?
- Because I designed it

16:45.079 --> 16:46.541
and I never got any credit.

16:46.542 --> 16:48.472
Hold on, back it up. Everybody knows

16:48.473 --> 16:50.761
that Earl Graystone designed
the Second Avenue subway line.

16:50.762 --> 16:52.752
Earl Graystone was a fraud!

16:52.762 --> 16:55.080
He designed overly
complicated subway routes

16:55.081 --> 16:57.479
for absolutely no reason.

16:57.480 --> 16:59.370
And yes, people loved it. They ate it up.

16:59.371 --> 17:01.798
They called him a visionary.
Said his designs were sexy.

17:01.799 --> 17:03.918
Sounds like a real Camomile White.

17:03.919 --> 17:05.650
I, on the other hand,

17:05.651 --> 17:08.576
cared about the commuter, so
I designed a straight-line

17:08.577 --> 17:11.601
Second Avenue subway line
that cut travel time in half.

17:11.602 --> 17:14.587
But then that a-hole stole my design.

17:14.588 --> 17:16.977
And I'll be hot-damned
if they finish that thing

17:16.987 --> 17:18.876
and give that charlatan credit.

17:18.877 --> 17:21.335
So, this whole thing is
all about recognition?

17:21.336 --> 17:23.693
- I want my name remembered. Is that wrong?
- No,

17:23.694 --> 17:25.823
but come on, look at what you're doing.

17:25.824 --> 17:27.415
What am I doing?

17:27.416 --> 17:29.177
You're holding up
something that could help

17:29.178 --> 17:30.501
like a ton of people.

17:30.502 --> 17:32.233
Something that you created.

17:32.234 --> 17:33.925
You just said you have the
interest of the commuter

17:33.926 --> 17:36.353
at heart, but these are the
people who are suffering.

17:36.354 --> 17:38.682
You know, I mean,

17:38.683 --> 17:40.274
these are like poor, tortured souls

17:40.275 --> 17:41.568
that have no one else to turn to.

17:41.569 --> 17:43.867
They have no one else that can help them.

17:43.868 --> 17:45.629
Yeah...

17:45.630 --> 17:47.391
but I-I...

17:50.078 --> 17:51.272
I still want the recognition.

17:51.273 --> 17:53.462
Are you serious? After that whole speech?

17:53.472 --> 17:55.224
I want credit for my design.

17:55.234 --> 17:57.284
You're asking me to
rewrite history, okay.

17:57.294 --> 17:58.487
I can't do that.

17:58.488 --> 18:00.050
Sue: Wait, we can do that.

18:00.051 --> 18:01.672
We can rewrite history.

18:01.673 --> 18:03.672
I used to do it for Camomile all the time.

18:03.673 --> 18:07.126
It's called Wikipedia and
all we need is Internet access.

18:07.127 --> 18:09.285
Bless wicked-pedia.

18:09.286 --> 18:11.446
I have no idea what Internet access means.

18:14.701 --> 18:17.028
- That should be it.
- That's it?

18:17.029 --> 18:18.491
That's it?

18:18.492 --> 18:21.348
Daniel L. Turner is all
over the subway entries now.

18:21.349 --> 18:22.512
All I gotta do is click submit.

18:22.513 --> 18:24.235
- Do it.
- (Sue claps)

18:26.932 --> 18:28.125
Aw, damn! What?

18:28.126 --> 18:29.351
Ain't no signal.

18:29.361 --> 18:31.479
Up, hey, hold on, Roof.

18:31.480 --> 18:33.141
Careful there. Ah, my legs, my legs.

18:33.142 --> 18:34.903
I gotcha. I know, I gotta squeeze tight.

18:34.904 --> 18:37.083
Two bar, one bar, two bar.
He's got two bars.

18:37.084 --> 18:38.561
Submit.

18:40.570 --> 18:43.120
Ha ha, I don't know
what just happened there,

18:43.121 --> 18:45.199
but I liked that tremendously.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.416
Yeah, me too.

18:46.426 --> 18:49.691
Hey, I am so sorry I
destroyed you by accident.

18:49.701 --> 18:51.136
It's okay.

18:51.137 --> 18:53.447
Hey, guys, I know this is a long shot,

18:53.448 --> 18:55.164
but if you happen to talk to the mayor,

18:55.165 --> 18:58.419
could you ask him to name
the subway line the T?

18:58.420 --> 18:59.725
As in Turner?

18:59.726 --> 19:01.363
Sure, you got it man.

19:06.768 --> 19:09.278
- That's him leaving?
- That's him leaving.

19:09.279 --> 19:12.473
Oh, man. Thank you, Roofie. Thanks, man.

19:12.474 --> 19:14.884
So, what, this means you're
back in the game, right?

19:16.331 --> 19:17.535
Kevin: Yeah.

19:17.536 --> 19:18.913
Yeah, I think so.

19:21.153 --> 19:23.231
Yeah, kinda sucks you didn't get credit

19:23.232 --> 19:24.848
for clearing the subway line.

19:24.849 --> 19:26.858
I'm looking at
Camomile's Wikipedia page,

19:26.859 --> 19:28.496
it says Camomile White was the one.

19:28.506 --> 19:30.575
Yeah, that doesn't surprise me.

19:30.585 --> 19:33.941
So uh, you want me to make
a Wikipedia page about you?

19:35.950 --> 19:39.968
Uh... nah. I'm good.

19:45.302 --> 19:46.879
Well, I'm gonna do one anyways.

19:51.480 --> 19:54.323
(Dramatic theme playing)

19:54.333 --> 19:57.375
Male reporter (On TV): Second Avenue
construction resumed today without a hitch,

19:57.376 --> 20:00.901
thanks to the exorcism
performed by Camomile White.

20:00.902 --> 20:03.413
According to our source, Wikipedia,

20:03.414 --> 20:05.864
she also had considerable
behind-the-scenes help

20:05.865 --> 20:08.878
from a colleague,
relatively unknown medium,

20:08.888 --> 20:10.123
Kevin Pacalioglu.

20:10.124 --> 20:12.133
Fitz!

20:14.011 --> 20:15.658
What have I told you about using my makeup?

20:15.659 --> 20:16.793
- I have an audition.
- Oh, jeez!

20:16.794 --> 20:18.095
He's trying to take me down!

20:18.096 --> 20:19.552
- It's recurring.
- He's coming for me.

20:19.553 --> 20:20.980
- Make this work.
- Who, who? Calm down.

20:20.981 --> 20:22.826
Calm down, let me see.
What are you talking for?

20:22.836 --> 20:24.943
I need you to play the video recorder.

20:24.944 --> 20:26.721
Oh, way, no, no, no. Looks
like someone's...

20:26.722 --> 20:29.383
- Ooh, something chewed there.
- No. No. No.

20:29.384 --> 20:31.296
No, Fitz, these need to go back in there.

20:31.297 --> 20:33.501
- Put them back in the camera.
- Look, it's not... you can't...

20:33.502 --> 20:34.958
you need to reconnect this.

20:34.959 --> 20:36.484
Put them back in there.
I need this to play.

20:36.485 --> 20:37.941
I need you to take a deep breath.

20:37.942 --> 20:39.310
Camomile: I need this to be able to play.

20:39.311 --> 20:42.031
- (Arguing continues)
- (Murmuring)

20:49.200 --> 20:50.695
(Exhales)

20:50.696 --> 20:53.610
Okay, here it is.

20:53.611 --> 20:55.688
The east river.

20:55.689 --> 20:57.409
Sue: It's perfect.

20:59.643 --> 21:02.509
Kevin, what's it like in the light?

21:03.344 --> 21:04.965
I don't know.

21:04.966 --> 21:08.444
Once I go, I can't come back, right?

21:08.988 --> 21:10.609
No.

21:10.610 --> 21:12.262
(Melancholy theme playing)

21:13.758 --> 21:14.952
I'll miss you.

21:14.953 --> 21:16.993
Samesies.

21:19.003 --> 21:20.626
(Exhaling): Okay.

21:43.881 --> 21:46.028
- What happened?
- I don't know.

21:47.612 --> 21:48.815
It didn't work.

21:48.816 --> 21:50.701
Yeah, it's okay, it's okay.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.166
Don't worry, it
happens to lots of ghosts.

21:52.167 --> 21:54.760
Maybe, your unfinished
business is something else?

21:54.761 --> 21:57.248
We'll figure it out.
I'll help you, everyday.

21:57.258 --> 21:58.840
- No matter how long it takes.
- Really?

21:58.841 --> 22:00.462
Yeah.

22:00.463 --> 22:03.668
And maybe you can move into
my apartment, or whatever.

22:03.669 --> 22:05.708
Just-just until you
find somewhere to haunt.

22:05.709 --> 22:08.399
- Okay.
- All right.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.603

22:09.604 --> 22:12.003
