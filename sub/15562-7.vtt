WEBVTT

00:01.617 --> 00:02.550
- Yes!
- No!

00:02.565 --> 00:04.407
If we line up the voters this way,

00:04.408 --> 00:07.110
they'll be shuttled
towards the impulse buys.

00:07.144 --> 00:09.279
There are going to be millions
of new customers in here,

00:09.313 --> 00:10.947
and you're focused on the chewing gum?

00:10.981 --> 00:12.582
Why not funnel them
towards, I don't know,

00:12.616 --> 00:13.583
the big-ticket stuff?

00:13.617 --> 00:14.651
Get your head in the game.

00:14.718 --> 00:15.952
Oh, my head is in the game.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.987
I've been here since 4:00 a.m.

00:18.055 --> 00:19.422
I've already had three meals.

00:19.456 --> 00:21.257
It's not even 7:00.
That's too many meals.

00:21.292 --> 00:23.326
It's 7:00. We should open.

00:23.394 --> 00:24.661
Good idea. I'm on it.

00:24.728 --> 00:26.429
Let the democratic process begin.

00:26.463 --> 00:28.398
No, I'm in charge.

00:28.432 --> 00:31.401
I get to let the voters in.

00:31.427 --> 00:33.778
Let the democratic process begin.

00:33.779 --> 00:35.746
- No, you messed it up.
- I know what the code is.

00:35.781 --> 00:37.148
Yeah, but I already put in
the first three digits.

00:37.214 --> 00:38.414
Okay, so what's clear?

00:38.449 --> 00:39.449
That's enter. You got to go back.

00:39.483 --> 00:40.750
No!

00:40.785 --> 00:42.986
Great. Three wrong codes,
so now we have to wait

00:43.053 --> 00:44.721
five minutes before we can try again.

00:44.755 --> 00:46.923
Yeah. Thanks, Dina.

00:46.957 --> 00:49.926
I'm sorry. It'll be a few minutes.

00:56.066 --> 00:58.968
Attention Cloud 9 shoppers,
Election Day is here,

00:59.003 --> 01:00.603
and we're offering up big discounts

01:00.638 --> 01:02.505
on all American-made products.

01:02.573 --> 01:04.607
So that's 40% off your
generic medications,

01:04.641 --> 01:07.610
inferior electronics, and cheese curls.

01:07.645 --> 01:09.946
What is a comptroller?

01:09.980 --> 01:11.981
Something to do with computers, I think.

01:12.016 --> 01:15.534
Really? Or do those
two words just sound the same?

01:15.535 --> 01:17.236
- They sound the same.
- Yeah.

01:17.270 --> 01:19.605
Doesn't mean it's not true, though.

01:19.673 --> 01:21.707
What is this?

01:21.741 --> 01:25.363
"Official Cloud 9 Election Guide."

01:27.173 --> 01:29.007
They're trying to tell
us who to vote for!

01:29.041 --> 01:30.375
I don't know what
you're complaining about.

01:30.443 --> 01:31.643
I love getting mail.

01:31.677 --> 01:33.144
You don't think
it's a little misleading?

01:33.179 --> 01:34.379
For State Senator:

01:34.447 --> 01:36.214
"Jack Peterson supports
your right to work,"

01:36.282 --> 01:38.717
which is basically just another
way of saying "anti-union."

01:38.799 --> 01:41.138
Let's not use the U-word.

01:41.139 --> 01:43.107
- While Gary 'Slick' Langham"...
- "Slick."

01:43.141 --> 01:46.644
They're actually using the
nickname his opponent gave him.

01:46.687 --> 01:49.680
Langham "has never gone on
record as being pro-America."

01:49.748 --> 01:51.148
What's his problem?

01:51.183 --> 01:53.571
Glenn, it just seems really shady.

01:53.607 --> 01:55.119
Are they even allowed to do this?

01:55.153 --> 01:55.698
Come on.

01:55.699 --> 01:59.064
It's not like anyone around here
ever reads anything anyway.

01:59.065 --> 02:00.232
- Yeah, we do!
- That's ridiculous.

02:00.267 --> 02:02.601
Oh? What was the emergency safety memo

02:02.669 --> 02:04.036
I sent out last week about?

02:04.070 --> 02:05.871
- Um...
- The...

02:05.906 --> 02:07.606
See? Relax.

02:07.674 --> 02:08.917
It'll be fine.

02:08.918 --> 02:11.086
By the way, the answer was
the building got an F

02:11.121 --> 02:13.021
in tornado preparedness.

02:13.056 --> 02:16.841
The inspector says this
place is a house of cards.

02:16.842 --> 02:18.643
Hey. I'm just reminding
everyone to vote.

02:18.676 --> 02:20.744
We want a 100% employee turnout.

02:20.811 --> 02:22.379
A lot of people died so you could vote.

02:22.413 --> 02:24.414
Also, a lot of horses died.

02:24.482 --> 02:25.899
We always forget about the horses.

02:25.900 --> 02:27.592
Oh, I'm not 18 yet.

02:27.745 --> 02:30.937
You know, it's funny.
I can drink, but I can't vote.

02:30.972 --> 02:33.440
Well, I'll be definitely
getting my vote on.

02:33.474 --> 02:34.975
Hey!

02:35.009 --> 02:35.976
Okay, good.

02:36.010 --> 02:38.278
Also, voting time is unpaid.

02:38.312 --> 02:40.147
Nobody paid those horses to die.

02:42.350 --> 02:44.084
Cheyenne, can you keep a secret?

02:44.118 --> 02:46.186
Oh, my God. Not really, but go.

02:46.254 --> 02:49.122
Okay.

02:49.157 --> 02:53.960
A few months ago, I found out
that I'm actually undocumented.

02:53.995 --> 02:55.996
- Oh.
- Yeah.

02:56.030 --> 02:56.999
Okay.

02:58.593 --> 03:00.427
I don't know what that means.

03:00.461 --> 03:03.730
It means that I'm an illegal alien.

03:05.505 --> 03:07.901
No, I'm... I'm human,

03:07.935 --> 03:10.737
who happens to live
in the country illegally.

03:11.021 --> 03:13.455
Oh. That's your secret?

03:13.456 --> 03:15.742
I thought you were gonna tell me
about how you're dating Jeff.

03:15.777 --> 03:18.302
Wait. You know about that?

03:18.303 --> 03:19.236
Yeah, but don't worry.

03:19.304 --> 03:20.337
I only told my baby,

03:20.372 --> 03:22.673
and she's not gonna tell anybody.

03:22.707 --> 03:24.178
She doesn't have any friends.

03:24.319 --> 03:26.420
Well, it doesn't matter anyway.

03:26.842 --> 03:28.242
When Dina finds out I can't vote,

03:28.243 --> 03:29.857
she'll figure out what's
going on and fire me.

03:30.229 --> 03:33.331
Oh, you can't just get one
of those "I voted" stickers

03:33.332 --> 03:34.962
and say that you voted?

03:34.997 --> 03:38.099
Oh. Yeah. Right.

03:38.133 --> 03:39.967
Chey!

03:40.002 --> 03:42.803
You are so much smarter
than what I tell people.

03:42.838 --> 03:44.972
Aww, thank you.

03:45.007 --> 03:47.975
So, do you love Jeff?

03:48.010 --> 03:50.478
Shut up. I don't know. Maybe.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here

04:00.200 --> 04:02.534
Oh, gosh, Syd, I guess if I was pressed,

04:02.569 --> 04:03.869
I'd have to say

04:03.904 --> 04:06.605
Buzz Aldrin, Bruce Lee, or Murphy Brown.

04:06.673 --> 04:08.874
Beep. Beep. Java truck comin' through.

04:08.909 --> 04:09.826
What're you doing?

04:09.827 --> 04:13.229
American coffee
for these American heroes.

04:13.264 --> 04:15.365
Actually, the beans are from Rwanda,

04:15.400 --> 04:18.702
but the water's from the good
ol' faucet in the men's room.

04:18.736 --> 04:20.437
Well, as I'm sure Syd
here will tell you,

04:20.505 --> 04:22.124
you can't give poll workers gifts.

04:22.152 --> 04:23.190
That's called bribery.

04:23.191 --> 04:24.908
Oh, that's okay.

04:24.943 --> 04:27.611
Actually, I usually have
a Danish with my coffee.

04:27.679 --> 04:28.279
Oh.

04:28.280 --> 04:30.813
- Yum.
- So do I. Yeah.

04:30.848 --> 04:33.316
Fine, I guess I'll go
buy myself a Danish.

04:33.740 --> 04:35.908
- Have a heavenly snack.
- Enjoy it.

04:35.943 --> 04:36.909
Yeah.

04:36.944 --> 04:37.976
Could you move?

04:37.977 --> 04:39.701
Oh, hi, I'm Glenn.

04:39.745 --> 04:42.881
I really want these poll
workers to love me.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.883
I'm not the one throwing myself at Syd

04:44.959 --> 04:46.493
like some kind of cigarette girl.

04:46.518 --> 04:48.216
- Oh, please.
- Yeah, please... move!

04:48.217 --> 04:49.986
- No, I'm sitting here.
- I'm putting this here.

04:49.987 --> 04:50.665
No, well, put it somewhere else!

04:50.666 --> 04:51.999
Find somewhere else for it go.
No, I'm putting it there.

04:52.067 --> 04:53.300
Aah, it's hot!

04:53.335 --> 04:54.835
What did you do?

04:54.903 --> 04:57.638
I didn't do it!
You did it with your tushy!

05:02.639 --> 05:03.605
Damn it. Distract them.

05:03.606 --> 05:04.572
What?

05:06.772 --> 05:08.340
It's totally slanted.

05:08.416 --> 05:09.868
They're just pushing the pro-business,

05:09.869 --> 05:11.102
anti-worker candidates.

05:11.169 --> 05:14.438
What? A corporation
doing something unethical?

05:14.506 --> 05:15.873
To protect its interests?

05:15.907 --> 05:17.074
This is shocking!

05:17.109 --> 05:18.843
All right. Maybe Glenn's right.

05:18.877 --> 05:20.077
Maybe it doesn't matter.

05:20.112 --> 05:21.237
Hey, Marcus?

05:21.238 --> 05:23.085
Who did you vote for for state senate?

05:23.086 --> 05:24.009
Jack Peterson.

05:24.053 --> 05:25.742
He's pro-freedom and anti-bad guys,

05:25.809 --> 05:28.177
and those are two things
I can get behind.

05:28.212 --> 05:30.346
Hey, are we still on for drinks tonight?

05:30.381 --> 05:31.514
- Please stop asking us.
- No.

05:31.548 --> 05:32.515
- We never were.
- Ah, cool.

05:32.549 --> 05:34.217
Well, we'll figure it out later.

05:35.552 --> 05:37.053
God, people will believe anything

05:37.087 --> 05:38.908
with the word "official" on it.

05:40.044 --> 05:42.345
Do you know what we should do?

05:42.489 --> 05:44.023
No, never mind. It's stupid.

05:44.024 --> 05:45.524
No, I'm gonna say it.

05:45.696 --> 05:48.934
We should make our own
pamphlet with the truth.

05:48.935 --> 05:49.901
Ooh.

05:49.970 --> 05:52.404
A rogue pamphlet?

05:52.439 --> 05:53.839
You're crazy, lady.

05:53.907 --> 05:55.174
I think that's a great idea,

05:55.242 --> 05:56.976
and I have layout experience.

05:57.010 --> 05:58.944
- I was the editor...
- Editor on your high school-

05:58.979 --> 06:00.097
I already told you that story.
Forget it.

06:00.098 --> 06:02.032
- I am in.
- Me too!

06:02.066 --> 06:03.874
Couldn't be less interested.

06:03.875 --> 06:06.282
Hey, should we invite
Sandra to drinks tonight?

06:06.384 --> 06:07.843
Or is it just the core four?

06:09.212 --> 06:10.479
You guys are busy.

06:10.514 --> 06:12.348
Everyone's busy.

06:14.882 --> 06:16.155
Could I just snag one of these stickers?

06:16.156 --> 06:18.400
Oh, these are just for people who voted.

06:18.401 --> 06:19.235
Are you voting?

06:19.236 --> 06:21.737
I would, but I just don't like
any of the candidates.

06:21.771 --> 06:23.405
Trump's all like...

06:23.424 --> 06:25.905
And Hillary's all...

06:26.288 --> 06:28.222
Anyway, enough politics.
I just need a sticker.

06:28.290 --> 06:32.159
Well, I'm sure the store sells stickers.

06:32.194 --> 06:33.894
I'm not just trying to collect stickers.

06:33.962 --> 06:35.462
I'm a grown man.

06:35.497 --> 06:37.965
Oh, my God... is that James Brolin?

06:37.999 --> 06:38.969
Who?

06:40.335 --> 06:42.369
Barbra Streisand's husband?

06:42.404 --> 06:44.171
Josh Brolin's dad?

06:44.691 --> 06:47.896
Diane Lane's ex-father-in-law?
Am I crazy?

06:47.898 --> 06:49.732
Sir, you know who James
Brolin is, right?

06:49.766 --> 06:51.033
What's he running for?

06:51.067 --> 06:52.868
Oh, my God.

06:58.775 --> 07:01.043
Oh, yeah. That's drying up real nice.

07:01.077 --> 07:03.779
Did you write yourself in
for attorney general?

07:04.448 --> 07:06.282
Could've been anyone.

07:06.349 --> 07:07.917
Come on. Hurry up.

07:07.951 --> 07:11.086
You know we got to get these
back before anyone notices.

07:11.121 --> 07:12.588
You know what I just realized?

07:12.622 --> 07:14.522
There's, like, 50 ballots here.

07:14.523 --> 07:16.417
That could change the outcome
of a close election,

07:16.417 --> 07:17.225
and Missouri's a swing state,

07:17.259 --> 07:19.594
so we could be changing
the course of history.

07:19.662 --> 07:21.863
- You think so?
- Sure. Think about it.

07:21.897 --> 07:24.866
Right now, you and I
could be setting into effect

07:24.900 --> 07:26.101
a chain of events that could cause

07:26.168 --> 07:28.870
the colonization of Mars
or World War III

07:28.904 --> 07:30.930
and billions of innocent deaths.

07:32.696 --> 07:34.342
You know, it's funny,
I try so hard to keep

07:34.343 --> 07:37.778
God out of the workplace,
and yet, here I am,

07:37.813 --> 07:40.448
in the workplace,

07:40.482 --> 07:41.949
and I am God.

07:43.385 --> 07:44.485
What are you doing?

07:44.520 --> 07:46.192
We need to speed this up.

07:48.189 --> 07:50.090
- No, turn it off!
- I'm trying!

07:50.158 --> 07:51.525
Oh! Oh!

07:51.559 --> 07:52.659
Come back!

07:58.351 --> 07:59.852
Well, the ballots are clearly gone.

07:59.853 --> 08:03.275
Okay. We're just gonna have to
face the music and tell Syd.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.828
We tampered with an election.
Do you know how serious that is?

08:05.829 --> 08:06.962
It was a goof-up!

08:06.963 --> 08:07.996
We have to cover our tracks.

08:08.064 --> 08:08.997
We've got to come up with an alibi

08:09.065 --> 08:10.132
for what we've been doing all day.

08:10.166 --> 08:11.600
Okay, uh...

08:12.335 --> 08:13.802
We were in my office.

08:13.836 --> 08:16.004
- And we were working.
- Too vague.

08:16.072 --> 08:18.106
The more specific the lie,
the more believable it is.

08:18.141 --> 08:21.243
Okay, we were in your office
because you were telling me

08:21.277 --> 08:22.624
about the affair you've been having

08:22.625 --> 08:23.720
with your dental hygienist.

08:23.732 --> 08:24.780
She likes when you dance for her.

08:24.814 --> 08:26.748
I do not want to be having an affair!

08:26.782 --> 08:28.156
- Do you want to go to jail?
- No!

08:28.158 --> 08:29.150
Then you've been dancing for Shelley!

08:29.151 --> 08:30.732
- All right, fine!
- Okay.

08:30.733 --> 08:32.153
I'll erase the security cam footage.

08:32.154 --> 08:34.200
You need to find a field at
least an hour's drive from here

08:34.243 --> 08:36.198
and bury that ballot box,
and I mean bury it deep.

08:36.693 --> 08:39.129
Then we can never, ever,
ever tell anyone...

08:42.133 --> 08:42.966
Hey!

08:46.304 --> 08:48.505
Not to put my head in the lion's mouth,

08:48.539 --> 08:52.075
but now I'm thinking Times New Roman.

08:52.143 --> 08:54.756
Times New Roman would
be a fine font, Jonah,

08:54.757 --> 08:57.826
and so would Helvetica and Garamond,

08:57.860 --> 09:00.799
and really any font would be just fine.

09:02.098 --> 09:03.141
Not Wingdings.

09:03.142 --> 09:05.343
No one was suggesting Wingdings.

09:05.410 --> 09:07.177
Oh, you guys looking at porn?

09:07.245 --> 09:09.613
What? No. We're making the pamphlet.

09:09.648 --> 09:12.750
Wow! And they said it couldn't be done.

09:12.784 --> 09:15.753
But lo and behold,
here you are doing it,

09:15.787 --> 09:17.588
making a pamphlet!

09:17.622 --> 09:19.623
I feel like he's mocking us.

09:19.658 --> 09:22.092
Ooh, what about Palatino?

09:22.127 --> 09:24.328
Oh, Palatino's nice, actually.

09:24.362 --> 09:25.529
You watching porn?

09:25.597 --> 09:27.298
- Yup.
- Mm.

09:27.332 --> 09:29.800
Oh, I know that girl.

09:31.303 --> 09:33.203
Guess who got a sticker.

09:33.271 --> 09:34.772
Oh, my God, really?

09:38.841 --> 09:40.442
I made it myself.

09:43.279 --> 09:45.080
Yeah.

09:45.114 --> 09:47.349
I appreciate it.

09:47.417 --> 09:49.918
The thought, not the sticker,

09:49.953 --> 09:51.920
because it's useless.

09:51.955 --> 09:54.423
It's garbage. 'Kay?

10:06.269 --> 10:08.361
- Hey, girl.
- Hey.

10:08.362 --> 10:11.130
- Bitching color, boo.
- I know, right?

10:11.165 --> 10:13.614
Yeah, really brings out
the blueness of her veins.

10:13.615 --> 10:15.749
Listen, I've been thinking
about it a lot lately,

10:15.783 --> 10:19.686
and I have decided that you are
my best friend in the store.

10:19.754 --> 10:22.623
- Me? Really?
- Yeah.

10:22.657 --> 10:26.377
Okay, well, you're nice too.

10:26.378 --> 10:27.845
Yeah, I am nice.

10:27.879 --> 10:29.246
Anyway, I've been thinking about it,

10:29.280 --> 10:30.714
and I feel like we should just have

10:30.749 --> 10:33.052
a good old-fashioned girlfriend gabfest.

10:33.918 --> 10:35.185
Maybe you could tell me
if you've seen or heard

10:35.220 --> 10:37.388
anything suspicious recently.

10:37.422 --> 10:38.756
Mm. Suspicious?

10:38.790 --> 10:41.358
Yeah, you know, like... I don't know...

10:41.393 --> 10:44.049
if you know of anybody
doing anything illegal.

10:44.050 --> 10:45.017
Dish, girlfriend!

10:48.388 --> 10:52.291
Mm. Um, no.

10:52.325 --> 10:53.726
Really?

10:53.794 --> 10:55.194
'Cause, you know,
there's nothing I hate more

10:55.228 --> 10:56.996
than when my best friends lie to me.

10:57.731 --> 11:01.133
Okay, I have to go.

11:01.168 --> 11:02.134
I have to pee really bad.

11:02.169 --> 11:03.536
Excuse me.

11:03.570 --> 11:04.970
You want me to come with?

11:05.005 --> 11:07.339
That's what best girlfriends do, right?

11:09.509 --> 11:11.129
- Do you think she knows?
- It's hard to say.

11:11.130 --> 11:14.932
She's either playing dumb or just is.

11:14.966 --> 11:17.904
Jack Peterson is
anti-union, anti-worker,

11:17.905 --> 11:20.373
but Gary Langham wants
to raise minimum wage...

11:20.407 --> 11:23.209
- And expand sick days.
- Paid sick days.

11:35.022 --> 11:36.222
I don't know about youse guys,

11:36.257 --> 11:38.904
but I'm fed up with these
corporate fat cats.

11:38.905 --> 11:41.840
Not all warehouse workers
are from 1950s Brooklyn.

11:41.875 --> 11:44.177
You know what, I'm fed up with
these corporate fat cats too.

11:44.211 --> 11:46.012
- I'll take one of those.
- Hey!

11:51.885 --> 11:54.053
- She's a good broad, huh?
- And you're a good guy, Jonah.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.689
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

12:00.794 --> 12:02.128
You really think Dina knows?

12:02.196 --> 12:05.041
Maybe. She asked me
a lot of weird questions.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.301
The stupid poll worker lady
is guarding those stickers

12:08.369 --> 12:10.393
like it's her last tub of Activia.

12:10.394 --> 12:12.561
Oh, hey. Mateo, did you vote?

12:12.594 --> 12:16.236
Oh, my God. Why is everyone
obsessed with voting today?

12:16.237 --> 12:17.203
Oh.

12:22.797 --> 12:25.220
So then, I took the S train

12:25.232 --> 12:28.651
from the docks to my
mother's house in Flatbush.

12:28.804 --> 12:30.389
Hey, youse a good kid,

12:30.393 --> 12:31.805
respecting your mother like that.

12:31.841 --> 12:33.241
Yeah, but sometimes, you got to say,

12:33.309 --> 12:35.594
"Hey, Ma,
I'm going out with the fellas."

12:35.595 --> 12:37.269
- Yeah.
- "I'll see you at church."

12:37.302 --> 12:39.137
Oh, your guy's religious.

12:39.303 --> 12:40.403
No, he goes to church

12:40.437 --> 12:42.444
to respect his mother's
old-world values.

12:42.445 --> 12:43.873
- Sure.
- Obviously.

12:43.908 --> 12:45.680
That's the story.

12:45.681 --> 12:47.673
You know, don't take this the wrong way,

12:47.674 --> 12:51.575
but I feel like you've become a lot
more fun since I've known you.

12:51.643 --> 12:52.728
Thanks.

12:52.729 --> 12:54.249
And if I may return the compliment,

12:54.250 --> 12:56.932
I think you've become
marginally less annoying.

12:56.967 --> 12:58.234
Hey, hey, hey.

12:58.268 --> 13:00.002
Don't make me blush
in front of the fellas, huh?

13:04.841 --> 13:06.108
Hey, Syd. Everything all right?

13:06.143 --> 13:07.276
You were in there a while.

13:07.310 --> 13:08.582
Yeah, it's okay.

13:08.741 --> 13:09.841
We just wanted to make sure

13:09.876 --> 13:11.510
there were enough poll
workers out there,

13:11.544 --> 13:14.680
'cause, you know, we wouldn't
want any voter fraud to happen.

13:14.714 --> 13:16.181
Even though, as I keep telling him,

13:16.215 --> 13:18.016
there's almost no voter
fraud in this country.

13:18.051 --> 13:21.219
I mean, it's not worth
the penalty of, um...

13:21.254 --> 13:23.722
$10,000 and five years in prison.

13:25.558 --> 13:27.592
Did you say "prison"?

13:27.660 --> 13:29.695
- Or "prism"?
- Why would he say "prism"?

13:29.729 --> 13:31.096
What's five years in prism?

13:31.164 --> 13:32.998
Let him answer.

13:33.032 --> 13:34.232
Prison.

13:35.234 --> 13:38.737
- With an N or an M?
- Oh, my God.

13:38.771 --> 13:41.748
- So then I rip up my note cards.
- No.

13:41.749 --> 13:46.327
And say, "Fellow students,
forget these note cards."

13:46.328 --> 13:47.142
Going rogue.

13:47.143 --> 13:49.944
"I'm going to speak from my heart."

13:50.333 --> 13:50.974
Okay.

13:50.975 --> 13:54.187
And then, from the back
of the auditorium, Renee yells...

13:54.188 --> 13:55.288
No. Mm-mm.

13:55.357 --> 13:56.757
"Those cards are blank!"

13:56.792 --> 13:59.093
Oh! Renee is the worst.

13:59.127 --> 14:00.561
I haven't even told you
about the Winter Ball story...

14:00.596 --> 14:02.096
Surprise!

14:02.130 --> 14:04.465
Oh, hey. Hi.

14:04.661 --> 14:05.928
What are you... what are you doing here?

14:05.996 --> 14:08.864
You said you'd help me
pick out some towels.

14:08.898 --> 14:10.599
Oh, hi. I'm Naomi.

14:10.667 --> 14:13.333
Oh, Naomi, this is Amy. She's my boss.

14:13.334 --> 14:15.702
Amy, this is Naomi. She... we're...

14:15.770 --> 14:18.538
Oh, it's okay.
We don't have to label it yet.

14:18.606 --> 14:19.539
It's nice to meet you.

14:19.607 --> 14:22.342
You too. As well.

14:23.444 --> 14:24.286
Yeah.

14:24.287 --> 14:26.254
Naomi works the cheese booth

14:26.288 --> 14:28.789
at the farmers market by my house.

14:28.857 --> 14:30.892
Yes, the cheese booth,
not the soap booth.

14:31.927 --> 14:33.394
I forgot about that guy!

14:33.428 --> 14:34.795
"Where's the soap booth?"

14:34.863 --> 14:36.097
Yeah.

14:36.131 --> 14:38.132
This guy sounds crazy.

14:40.264 --> 14:42.000
So do you have time now?

14:42.383 --> 14:45.596
Yeah, well...
Amy, is it cool if I help Naomi

14:45.597 --> 14:47.062
pick out some stuff for her apartment,

14:47.063 --> 14:49.201
and then we'll do
the pamphlet stuff after?

14:49.244 --> 14:50.734
Yeah. Of course that's cool.

14:50.769 --> 14:53.771
Wow, a new apartment. A new man.

14:53.805 --> 14:55.873
It's a good time to be Naomi, hey?

14:55.907 --> 14:58.442
Yeah. Thanks.

15:00.111 --> 15:01.979
Okay. All right.

15:07.953 --> 15:08.986
Oh, my God.

15:20.265 --> 15:23.500
Rats gave birth in the nacho cheese.

15:23.501 --> 15:24.668
Cooked themselves to death.

15:30.928 --> 15:32.595
Thank you.

15:43.688 --> 15:45.155
Hey, Marcus!

15:45.991 --> 15:49.802
Hey... you've been to prison, right?

15:49.803 --> 15:52.105
Yeah. I mean, like, barely.

15:52.138 --> 15:54.139
Long enough to form
lifelong friendships.

15:54.173 --> 15:57.046
How do you think a guy
like me would do in there?

15:58.244 --> 16:00.846
Baby face. Kind eyes.

16:00.914 --> 16:03.348
Soft skin. Cute tummy.

16:03.416 --> 16:04.816
You'd be very popular.

16:04.851 --> 16:06.921
Oh. Well, that's good.

16:06.922 --> 16:07.855
No, that's bad.

16:07.923 --> 16:08.957
That's very bad.

16:08.998 --> 16:10.198
Oh.

16:10.259 --> 16:11.492
Let's say, hypothetically,

16:11.527 --> 16:14.429
that two people accidentally
committed a crime.

16:14.463 --> 16:16.162
There may have been a witness.

16:16.163 --> 16:17.460
Okay, well, if it were me,

16:17.461 --> 16:20.003
Ah... I guess I'd get my partner
to confess on tape.

16:20.034 --> 16:21.335
That way, if it went south,

16:21.369 --> 16:23.303
you could trade that in
for a reduced sentence.

16:23.338 --> 16:24.972
That's what my mom did to me.

16:25.006 --> 16:25.547
Huh.

16:27.308 --> 16:28.022
Okay.

16:28.023 --> 16:29.256
Thanks.

16:33.027 --> 16:35.162
Hey, Marcus.
You've been to prison, right?

16:35.196 --> 16:37.912
Oh-ho-ho. Look who's in demand today.

16:39.100 --> 16:40.461
It screams you, actually.

16:40.462 --> 16:42.830
Yeah, that's a very "you" towel.
Okay, you can have that one.

16:42.865 --> 16:43.831
No? All right.

16:43.866 --> 16:45.209
Did you guys meet Naomi?

16:45.210 --> 16:46.210
She's super cute.

16:46.429 --> 16:48.503
Yeah, she's really cute for Jonah.

16:48.537 --> 16:49.903
Do you think they're serious?

16:49.904 --> 16:52.131
Oh, yeah.
They've had sex, like, 11 times.

16:52.397 --> 16:53.635
- Really?
- I don't know.

16:53.636 --> 16:54.735
Why would I know that?

16:54.768 --> 16:57.604
You okay, sweetie? You seem stressed.

16:57.638 --> 16:59.839
Oh. Oh.

16:59.907 --> 17:02.075
My shoulders are so tight.

17:04.912 --> 17:06.813
What are you doing?

17:09.282 --> 17:11.818
I was trying to feel your breasts.

17:15.656 --> 17:17.022
Maybe he's drunk.

17:17.090 --> 17:18.968
There's a lot of drunk people here.

17:22.582 --> 17:24.082
Attention, my fellow Americans.

17:24.117 --> 17:26.351
I just noticed something on
the ballot about a "Supertrain."

17:26.384 --> 17:27.685
I'm not sure what it is,

17:27.719 --> 17:30.087
but it sounds more powerful
than a normal train.

17:30.122 --> 17:31.422
Let's make this happen, people.

17:31.456 --> 17:32.890
Vote Supertrain.

17:32.924 --> 17:34.592
Testing.

17:34.626 --> 17:36.627
Hey, you wanted to see me?

17:38.396 --> 17:40.764
Yeah. Come on in.

17:40.799 --> 17:42.433
I thought we should talk about

17:42.467 --> 17:44.435
all the stuff that went on today.

17:44.469 --> 17:46.604
Yeah. Actually,
I was thinking the same thing.

17:46.638 --> 17:48.572
It would be great
to just get on the same page.

17:48.607 --> 17:51.242
So, Dina Fox.

17:51.741 --> 17:52.708
What time is it?

17:52.742 --> 17:56.627
4:17 on November 8th, 2016, right?

17:56.628 --> 17:58.180
Yeah. Crazy day, especially given

17:58.181 --> 18:00.149
all the things you did, Glenn Sturgis,

18:00.183 --> 18:02.718
son of Arthur and Marian Sturgis.

18:04.692 --> 18:05.410
Hey.

18:05.411 --> 18:09.080
I'm sorry. I didn't know
Naomi was coming in today.

18:09.852 --> 18:11.253
No, it's... I mean, it's totally fine.

18:11.287 --> 18:12.299
I was just surprised.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.634
I didn't even know
you were dating anyone.

18:13.702 --> 18:15.269
Oh.

18:15.318 --> 18:19.211
Is that something that I'm
supposed to inform you about or?

18:19.274 --> 18:21.093
No! No, I don't care.

18:21.094 --> 18:22.665
I was just making conversation.

18:24.355 --> 18:25.955
Ah, so the new shift starts soon.

18:25.982 --> 18:27.983
Do you want me to just hand
these out as people clock in...

18:28.018 --> 18:28.943
Oh, do you know what?

18:28.944 --> 18:30.143
Actually, I got someone else to help.

18:30.671 --> 18:32.411
Hey, you're gonna vote
how I tell you to vote,

18:32.446 --> 18:33.513
or I swear to God,

18:33.581 --> 18:34.915
I'm gonna put a cricket in your house,

18:34.949 --> 18:36.349
and you'll never know where it is,

18:36.417 --> 18:37.817
and it'll drive you crazy.

18:37.852 --> 18:39.019
Marcus?

18:39.086 --> 18:41.588
Yeah. Well, you were
busy, and, you know,

18:41.622 --> 18:43.690
I figured your shift is over, so...

18:43.758 --> 18:46.927
Yeah. Yeah, no. Cool. Um...

18:46.961 --> 18:49.629
Okay, then, I'm gonna clock out.

18:49.664 --> 18:52.432
- Yeah. See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

18:53.701 --> 18:59.206
- We're gonna vote right now.
- Put me down! My bones!

18:59.273 --> 19:01.208
Put me down!

19:01.275 --> 19:02.842
He's such an idiot.

19:04.545 --> 19:06.279
Okay. Don't ask me any questions,

19:06.314 --> 19:08.348
but I want to buy your sticker.

19:08.382 --> 19:09.516
I can't tell you why.

19:11.686 --> 19:12.953
Okay.

19:12.987 --> 19:15.355
It's just, you know,
it's kind of a secret.

19:15.389 --> 19:18.325
I absolutely do not care.

19:18.359 --> 19:19.893
Excuse me.

19:21.295 --> 19:23.363
- It's kind of a long story.
- Do not care.

19:23.397 --> 19:24.731
Okay.

19:26.234 --> 19:27.867
You know, that's funny,
because I distinctly remembered

19:27.902 --> 19:30.203
you destroying the ballots,
Glenn Sturgis.

19:30.238 --> 19:32.472
Well, that's really funny,
because how could I have?

19:32.506 --> 19:35.642
I was in my office all day long...

19:35.676 --> 19:38.378
having an affair with
my dental hygienist, Shelley.

19:38.412 --> 19:40.013
Excuse me.

19:40.668 --> 19:41.944
Just wanted to let you know I voted.

19:41.945 --> 19:43.946
We're having a casual conversation!

19:44.014 --> 19:46.849
- Get out!
- Okay.

19:49.619 --> 19:51.620
District 35, where we are projecting

19:51.688 --> 19:53.956
pro-labor candidate
Gary Langham will prevail.

19:54.024 --> 19:56.382
Yes! Yes!

19:57.461 --> 20:00.176
We did it! We got Langham elected!

20:04.267 --> 20:05.734
Ames! Did you see?

20:05.769 --> 20:06.735
- Yes!
- We did it!

20:06.770 --> 20:08.938
I know! It's amazing!

20:08.972 --> 20:10.606
Oh, it's such a rush.
Thank you for involving me.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.708
No, thank you! We made a good team.

20:12.742 --> 20:15.711
- We did, didn't we?
- Yeah, we did.

20:16.713 --> 20:18.147
Ew, no. Marcus, what the hell?

20:18.215 --> 20:19.615
What? I thought this was, like,

20:19.649 --> 20:20.783
a flirty thing we were doing.

20:20.817 --> 20:23.118
- No.
- I'm so sorry. Wow.

20:23.153 --> 20:27.056
I totally misread that. Ugh.

20:27.928 --> 20:31.126
I mean, it's okay.
I just... I was just startled.

20:31.161 --> 20:32.495
I was just a little... Marcus!

20:32.562 --> 20:34.630
You just said it's okay.

20:38.668 --> 20:40.769
- Hey, Dorothy.
- Uh-huh?

20:40.804 --> 20:43.138
We're missing 53 ballots.

20:43.173 --> 20:44.740
Really?

20:46.009 --> 20:47.977
Jeez, that's way down from last time.

20:49.679 --> 20:53.838
- Just tell me what you did.
- No, you tell me what you did!

20:53.987 --> 20:54.483
Fine.

20:54.729 --> 20:56.863
I, Glenn Sturgis,
deliberately destroyed...

20:56.897 --> 20:58.331
No, I'm Glenn!

20:58.365 --> 20:59.999
- 50 United States ballots.
- Stop making me say that!

21:00.034 --> 21:03.036
And then I covered it up,
which is dumb, because I'm dumb.

21:03.070 --> 21:04.404
I'm Dina Fox! Dina Fox!

21:04.472 --> 21:06.005
Also, I have a tiny penis,
and my wife hates my guts!

21:06.040 --> 21:08.174
And I destroyed the ballots
'cause I'm a big, stupid meanie!

21:09.305 --> 21:15.320
