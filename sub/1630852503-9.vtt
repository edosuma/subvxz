WEBVTT

00:11.185 --> 00:13.187
<i>Previously on</i> Good Sam...

00:13.230 --> 00:14.536
He was driving. I got hurt.

00:14.579 --> 00:16.712
I had to have surgery,
and he couldn't be in it.

00:16.755 --> 00:19.367
The reason he didn't
come into the ER

00:19.410 --> 00:21.717
that day is because
I wouldn't let him.

00:21.760 --> 00:24.154
- I was drunk.
- And you knew.

00:24.198 --> 00:25.547
I just want to focus

00:25.590 --> 00:26.852
on my patients, and I want

00:26.896 --> 00:28.071
to get you
through your proctorship.

00:28.115 --> 00:30.247
You in to something,
all right.

00:30.291 --> 00:31.596
You and Malcolm
didn't work it out?

00:31.640 --> 00:32.945
No.

00:32.989 --> 00:34.164
I can't get
emotionally involved.

00:34.208 --> 00:36.166
I just need
to stop thinking.

00:41.258 --> 00:42.912
♪ Ah, vacation...

00:44.914 --> 00:46.481
<i>Doctor.</i><i>Doctor.</i>

00:49.223 --> 00:52.661
♪ Ah, vacation, vacation...

00:54.489 --> 00:56.839
♪ I think I need a vacation...

00:58.580 --> 01:00.234
Shh.

01:03.715 --> 01:05.717
That lock is gonna
give out eventually.

01:05.761 --> 01:07.980
Yeah, given its
current rate of use,

01:08.024 --> 01:09.199
I'd say sooner than later.

01:09.243 --> 01:10.896
I'll reinforce it.

01:10.940 --> 01:13.029
Good. Keep the
outside world out.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.901
Yeah, for the next,
uh, nine minutes.

01:15.945 --> 01:17.381
What?

01:17.425 --> 01:19.383
No. No. Rounds.

01:19.427 --> 01:21.472
Yeah. You know what?
How is it that

01:21.516 --> 01:24.562
it's me reminding you
it's time for work again?

01:24.606 --> 01:26.608
Huh? You were always
the first one in.

01:26.651 --> 01:30.002
I know, I know.

01:30.046 --> 01:32.309
You got to talk to your dad.

01:33.615 --> 01:34.790
Why would I do that?

01:34.833 --> 01:36.966
Because it's been
two weeks of this.

01:37.009 --> 01:38.402
I mean, you're dragging
your feet to work,

01:38.446 --> 01:40.187
you're making that face
every time

01:40.230 --> 01:41.710
his name comes up,
hiding out in here

01:41.753 --> 01:43.494
with me, not that
I mind that part,

01:43.538 --> 01:45.409
- Mm-hmm.
- But it can't make it easier

01:45.453 --> 01:46.889
to work
with the guy every day.

01:46.932 --> 01:49.718
I mean, it does

01:49.761 --> 01:51.807
make it a little easier.

01:51.850 --> 01:53.983
You know?

01:55.985 --> 01:58.161
I don't have anything
to say to him.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.424
Okay, so then...

02:00.468 --> 02:03.471
say it to me.
Pretend I'm your dad.

02:03.514 --> 02:05.168
Pretend you're my dad?

02:05.212 --> 02:07.039
Do you... never

02:07.083 --> 02:08.693
want to have sex with me again?

02:08.737 --> 02:10.826
Just say whatever
comes to mind.

02:10.869 --> 02:12.523
Okay? You've got
- seven minutes.
- Caleb, I don't...

02:13.698 --> 02:15.483
Six and a half. Go.

02:15.526 --> 02:18.355
You shouldn't drink and drive
with your child in the car.

02:18.399 --> 02:19.617
Good. Keep going.

02:19.661 --> 02:22.446
If you do drink and drive

02:22.490 --> 02:24.970
with said child in the car
and you get in an accident,

02:25.014 --> 02:27.059
don't lie to them about it
for the next 20 years.

02:27.103 --> 02:29.192
Doctors are supposed to hold
themselves to a higher standard.

02:29.236 --> 02:32.239
How else do we expect patients
to put themselves in our care?

02:32.282 --> 02:34.110
You are supposed

02:34.154 --> 02:36.504
to be able to trust your doctor.

02:36.547 --> 02:38.114
And your dad.

02:38.158 --> 02:41.073
I mean, not my dad.

02:41.117 --> 02:42.249
My mom, yeah,

02:42.292 --> 02:43.641
but she was there, too.

02:43.685 --> 02:46.340
She covered for him.
She kept this

02:46.383 --> 02:49.821
secret from me for 20...

02:49.865 --> 02:52.607
years, Caleb.

02:52.650 --> 02:53.695
I just...

02:55.000 --> 02:57.002
So, I take it you haven't
talked to her either.

02:57.046 --> 02:58.569
No.

02:58.613 --> 03:00.528
A] She's still
at that conference,

03:00.571 --> 03:02.834
and B] I am ignoring her calls.

03:02.878 --> 03:05.228
I am not ready
to talk to her.

03:07.448 --> 03:09.754
Are you ready
for rounds?

03:09.798 --> 03:12.844
I'm going
to the ER.

03:22.158 --> 03:23.768
Hey.
Hey.

03:23.812 --> 03:25.030
Oof.

03:25.074 --> 03:26.945
It's really coming down
out there.

03:26.989 --> 03:29.557
Seriously? We're talking
about the weather now?

03:29.600 --> 03:30.732
Is that what
it's come to?

03:32.647 --> 03:34.518
I mean, I guess we're
a little out of practice,

03:34.562 --> 03:35.606
small talk-wise.

03:36.912 --> 03:38.305
You sleep okay last night?

03:38.348 --> 03:40.176
What?

03:40.220 --> 03:42.222
You look a little... Oh. Yeah.

03:42.265 --> 03:43.919
No, I slept great. You?

03:43.962 --> 03:46.922
- Oh, yeah, good.
- Good.

03:46.965 --> 03:48.924
Your dad's
been better.

03:48.967 --> 03:51.970
No more nightmares, the
headaches are basically gone,

03:52.014 --> 03:55.670
and he hasn't missed a session
with Pyne.

03:55.713 --> 03:57.324
I'm glad.

03:57.367 --> 03:59.761
You don't seem glad.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.939
I am. I...

04:03.982 --> 04:06.376
I just don't know how long it's
gonna take me to get over it.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.291
Okay? The DUI's

04:08.335 --> 04:10.337
bad enough, but him hiding it
from me for so long,

04:10.380 --> 04:11.425
it's...
What DUI?

04:13.340 --> 04:14.341
He didn't tell you?

04:15.777 --> 04:17.561
You know what, don't worry
- about it.
- I'm...

04:17.605 --> 04:19.041
No, I-I want
to tell you.

04:19.084 --> 04:20.608
I want to be able
to talk to you about this.

04:20.651 --> 04:21.783
I just don't know what's mine

04:21.826 --> 04:23.350
- to share.
- It's fine, Sam.

04:23.393 --> 04:25.352
If Griff wants to tell me,
he'll tell me.

04:29.181 --> 04:32.010
It's really coming down
out there.

04:32.054 --> 04:34.709
Mm-hmm.
Here we go.

04:37.668 --> 04:38.843
Kevin Dunn, 12 years old.

04:38.887 --> 04:40.454
- He was hit by a bus.
- What?

04:40.497 --> 04:41.977
GCS of 15.
Chest wall abrasions

04:42.020 --> 04:43.805
and multiple lacerations
on the arms and legs.

04:43.848 --> 04:45.241
So, he was hit
by a bus?

04:45.285 --> 04:46.677
Skidded off the road.

04:46.721 --> 04:48.244
Why didn't you dress
this wound en route?

04:48.288 --> 04:49.289
We tried, but he wouldn't
let anybody touch him.

04:50.464 --> 04:53.510
Okay. Kevin, hey,
I'm Dr. Griffith

04:53.554 --> 04:56.121
and this is Dr. Trulie,
and we're gonna help you, okay?

04:56.165 --> 04:57.688
Yeah, yeah, your arm
is bleeding really bad.

04:57.732 --> 04:59.211
Leave me alone! Don't touch me!

05:01.866 --> 05:04.478
Hey, Kevin, who sits
in front of you in math?

05:04.521 --> 05:06.001
Uh, what?

05:06.044 --> 05:07.785
In your math class,
who sits in front of you?

05:07.829 --> 05:09.613
Oliver S.
Oliver S.

05:09.657 --> 05:10.919
Okay, who sits behind you?

05:10.962 --> 05:12.616
Oliver V.
Oliver V.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.575
There are two Olivers
in your math class?

05:14.618 --> 05:17.099
Wow. How many Kevins
are there?
Just one.

05:17.142 --> 05:18.753
Just one? See, that's why

05:18.796 --> 05:19.884
we've got to get you fixed up,
'cause there aren't

05:19.928 --> 05:21.190
any to spare, okay?

05:21.233 --> 05:22.931
Okay.
Okay.
Good job.

05:22.974 --> 05:25.455
Look at that.
I'm going to
stitch this up for you

05:25.499 --> 05:28.153
and have a listen
- to your chest, okay?
- Okay.

05:28.197 --> 05:29.720
You're doing great.

05:29.764 --> 05:31.548
- I got him.
- Okay.

05:31.592 --> 05:33.550
It's gonna be
a little cold.

05:33.594 --> 05:35.770
Hey, Gladys, after Dr. Trulie's
done with him,

05:35.813 --> 05:38.381
will you get him up to imaging
for a pan scan, please?

05:39.426 --> 05:40.557
Hey.

05:40.601 --> 05:41.906
We were waiting
for rounds,

05:41.950 --> 05:42.777
and then we heard
about the bus crash.

05:42.820 --> 05:44.213
Bus crash?

05:44.256 --> 05:45.693
I thought he was hit by a bus?

05:45.736 --> 05:47.564
Oh, he was, and then it crashed.

05:47.608 --> 05:49.349
How many
passengers?

05:49.392 --> 05:50.785
More than we have room for,

05:50.828 --> 05:53.178
and my shift ended
about 15 minutes ago.

05:53.222 --> 05:56.443
- Where's your relief?
- Waiting for the plows like everybody else.

05:56.486 --> 05:59.968
Okay, we have a bus crash
in the middle of a shift change.

06:00.011 --> 06:01.622
Half the hospital's on their
way out, and the roads

06:01.665 --> 06:03.319
are so bad... The other half
can't make it in.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.625
We got to stop everybody
from leaving.

06:04.668 --> 06:05.843
I'll put out
a hospital-wide bulletin.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.758
Okay, just tell
every department

06:07.802 --> 06:09.194
with available personnel
that they've got to

06:09.238 --> 06:10.500
send them down here.

06:10.544 --> 06:11.936
We are all on trauma today.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.130
Okay, so 20 so far.

06:32.174 --> 06:34.002
Yeah, they're setting up
an auxiliary triage upstairs.

06:34.045 --> 06:35.873
We'll keep the most
critical down here. Okay.

06:35.917 --> 06:37.309
Hey.

06:38.746 --> 06:40.269
Have you talked to Mom?

06:40.312 --> 06:41.923
No. Looks like her flight
took off from Denver,

06:41.966 --> 06:44.142
but the weather in Detroit's
gonna delay the landing.

06:44.186 --> 06:45.883
- All right.
- Have you talked to her?

06:45.927 --> 06:47.276
I'm not...

06:47.319 --> 06:50.148
Sam. Sam, it's killing her.

06:50.192 --> 06:51.802
Now, look, I get

06:51.846 --> 06:53.848
you've ignored my calls and
emails the last couple weeks,

06:53.891 --> 06:56.154
I get it, but at least
I get to talk to you at work.

06:56.198 --> 06:58.548
Yeah. We have a cervical
spine fracture

06:58.592 --> 07:00.550
in Consult Room Eight.
Have you paged Anders?

07:00.594 --> 07:02.247
He's stuck on the Lodge,
so is Robinson.

07:02.291 --> 07:03.466
Well, they got farther
than Isan.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.076
He's stuck in his driveway.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.122
I'll take the fracture.
You gather supplies.

07:07.165 --> 07:10.038
Uh, excuse-- Supplies?

07:10.081 --> 07:12.040
Gloves, gauze,
syringes, needles.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.258
We need them all down here.

07:13.302 --> 07:15.783
If you advanced
my proctorship,

07:15.826 --> 07:17.480
I could do more than raid
the supply closets.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.177
You know that
I can't clear you.

07:20.004 --> 07:22.659
Dad...

07:22.703 --> 07:25.619
I know your symptoms
are subsiding,

07:25.662 --> 07:28.926
but you are still in treatment
for PTSD. You did not

07:28.970 --> 07:30.667
complete your
solo surgery.

07:30.711 --> 07:32.930
You know that I cannot
advance you until you do.

07:32.974 --> 07:35.585
These are extenuating
circumstances, maybe just

07:35.629 --> 07:36.934
- on a temporary basis?
- It's not happening.

07:36.978 --> 07:38.545
Okay.

07:38.588 --> 07:40.285
I get you don't want to talk
about the accident.

07:40.329 --> 07:42.679
- Is that what this is about?
- This is about the patients.

07:42.723 --> 07:44.333
I get that you

07:44.376 --> 07:45.769
don't want to follow the rules,

07:45.813 --> 07:47.118
and you don't care
who your actions hurt,

07:47.162 --> 07:48.555
but there is a line
between right

07:48.598 --> 07:50.513
and wrong, and somebody's
got to hold it.

07:50.557 --> 07:53.037
I just want to help.

07:53.081 --> 07:54.561
Then get supplies.

07:57.259 --> 07:58.869
Hey, Tim, Joey's got you.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.567
Hey. This is Carla.

08:00.610 --> 08:03.308
Her arteriovenous fistula
for dialysis was

08:03.352 --> 08:05.136
- damaged in the accident.
- That is unfortunate.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.269
And that's what happens
when the state of Michigan

08:07.312 --> 08:09.532
gives a driver's license
to a horse's ass.

08:09.576 --> 08:10.751
She's very mad about the crash.

08:10.794 --> 08:12.361
I can see that.

08:12.404 --> 08:13.667
I've been a licensed driver
for over 40 years.

08:13.710 --> 08:14.929
You know how many
tickets I've gotten?

08:14.972 --> 08:16.626
Zero.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.323
Now look at me.

08:18.367 --> 08:20.282
How many times a week
do you get dialysis, Carla?

08:20.325 --> 08:21.892
Usually three.
Uh-huh.

08:21.936 --> 08:23.894
But, um, I missed
them all this week.

08:23.938 --> 08:25.505
I was in Akron.

08:27.463 --> 08:29.160
My son had a baby.

08:29.204 --> 08:30.771
You missed three
dialysis sessions?

08:30.814 --> 08:33.034
It's my first grandchild.

08:33.077 --> 08:34.470
Well, congratulations, though.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.428
Well, thank you.

08:43.958 --> 08:45.437
What is he
still doing here?

08:46.700 --> 08:48.963
I asked for a pan scan.
Why isn't he in imaging?

08:49.006 --> 08:52.183
CT is backed up, and they're
asking for consent forms.

08:54.098 --> 08:56.405
Hey. I need you
to get Kevin bumped

08:56.448 --> 08:58.538
to the front of the line for
imaging and call his parents.

08:58.581 --> 09:00.627
Who?
The kid.

09:05.370 --> 09:06.676
Is that beneath you?

09:06.720 --> 09:09.374
No, no, no. I just
didn't assess him,

09:09.418 --> 09:10.593
that's all. Okay.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.421
Well, I would say start there.

09:12.464 --> 09:13.465
Look,

09:13.509 --> 09:16.294
I... I know what

09:16.338 --> 09:18.514
I did was wrong, of course I do.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.561
I've been sorry
every day since.

09:21.604 --> 09:22.866
No, you have been lying

09:22.910 --> 09:24.651
to me every day since.
You pushed

09:24.694 --> 09:27.218
me away, and you let me think
that it was my fault.

09:27.262 --> 09:28.916
All this time.

09:28.959 --> 09:30.482
So I do not need you
to be sorry now.

09:30.526 --> 09:32.833
I needed you to be better then.

09:32.876 --> 09:34.878
I needed you to not get
behind the wheel.

09:34.922 --> 09:37.054
I needed you to hold the line.

09:37.098 --> 09:39.491
And you couldn't
do it for me,

09:39.535 --> 09:41.581
so please just do it for him.

09:55.551 --> 09:57.466
Looks like I'm gonna have to
reschedule our appointment.

09:57.509 --> 09:59.033
Uh, what appointment?

09:59.076 --> 10:01.339
With the jeweler.
For the wedding bands?

10:01.383 --> 10:03.733
How are you thinking
about rings right now?

10:03.777 --> 10:05.256
It actually helps me
to think about it.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.215
Eases my stress.

10:08.738 --> 10:10.566
Spending thousands of dollars
on a piece of metal

10:10.610 --> 10:12.350
- does not ease my stress.
- Okay.

10:14.222 --> 10:15.745
I can't repair her fistula.

10:15.789 --> 10:18.574
I'm gonna have to put
a dialysis catheter in her neck.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.010
Well, good luck
with that.

10:27.757 --> 10:29.019
All right, what do we got?

10:29.063 --> 10:30.630
This is Dorothy,
according to her shirt.

10:30.673 --> 10:31.979
Looks like she hit her head
pretty hard in the crash.

10:32.022 --> 10:33.067
Knocked her out.

10:34.285 --> 10:35.809
Is that glass
in her knuckles?

10:35.852 --> 10:37.158
Could be
from the windows.

10:37.201 --> 10:38.855
Or the windshield.

10:38.899 --> 10:40.727
Contusion on her forehead
could be

10:40.770 --> 10:42.816
- from the steering wheel.
- She was driving the bus.

10:42.859 --> 10:45.383
I think so.

10:45.427 --> 10:47.647
Whoa. We have an
open femur fracture.

10:47.690 --> 10:50.562
If that's true, we're gonna
have to reduce it manually.

10:54.915 --> 10:56.612
Oof.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.702
Okay, Dorothy,
I'm not gonna lie to you,

10:59.746 --> 11:01.617
this is gonna hurt,

11:01.661 --> 11:03.271
but we're gonna
do it fast, okay?

11:03.314 --> 11:05.490
Ready? Here we go.
One, two,

11:05.534 --> 11:06.840
three.

11:09.494 --> 11:11.583
You ever see
that before?

11:11.627 --> 11:13.847
No reaction to that
degree of pain?

11:13.890 --> 11:15.326
This could be
a major head injury.

11:15.370 --> 11:16.719
I'll get her a scan.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.634
Okay.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.201
Governor just declared
a state of emergency.

11:20.244 --> 11:21.898
What?
They're closing
the roads.

11:21.942 --> 11:23.595
How will on-call
doctors get here?

11:23.639 --> 11:25.685
Could we send our, uh,
ambulances to pick them up?

11:25.728 --> 11:27.338
I think our ambulances are gonna
be a little busy right now.

11:27.382 --> 11:28.688
So, the only people
coming in...

11:28.731 --> 11:30.298
Are more patients.

11:30.341 --> 11:32.082
And I hate to bring
this up now, but with

11:32.126 --> 11:33.736
all these trauma cases,
we're gonna run short on blood.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.085
Uh, can we call
the Red Cross?

11:35.129 --> 11:36.870
Well, we could.
They'll be dealing

11:36.913 --> 11:38.915
- with their own shortages.
- So, we're almost at capacity,

11:38.959 --> 11:40.482
we're short on doctors,
and we're running out of blood?

11:40.525 --> 11:41.918
What do we do?

11:41.962 --> 11:43.572
We have to figure it out.
We have resources.

11:43.615 --> 11:44.965
We're gonna have to start
allocating them

11:45.008 --> 11:46.183
according to need.

11:46.227 --> 11:47.707
Who determines need?
There's no CMO.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.491
Well, I need
IV start kits.

11:49.534 --> 11:50.971
- We need more beds.
- The storm

11:51.014 --> 11:52.581
- isn't letting up.
- How are we supposed to keep

11:52.624 --> 11:54.017
- these people alive?
- All right, here's what...

11:54.061 --> 11:55.584
Okay, okay, everybody calm down.
Let's call down

11:55.627 --> 11:57.107
to the OR
and cancel every elective

11:57.151 --> 11:58.630
surgery on
the schedule.

11:58.674 --> 11:59.936
Let's get an inventory
at the blood bank.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.851
Find out how many
units and what type.

12:01.895 --> 12:03.374
We will do the same
with supplies,

12:03.418 --> 12:05.594
and we will not quit
until the storm does.

12:05.637 --> 12:06.943
This is what we signed up for.

12:06.987 --> 12:09.772
This is why we do
what we do.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.295
So let's get back
to our patients

12:11.339 --> 12:13.994
because right now
we are all they have.

12:21.958 --> 12:23.612
I've got one more.

12:23.655 --> 12:26.267
Hey, patient in Trauma Three
needs two ice packs.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.618
How's he doing?

12:29.661 --> 12:31.620
Uh, CT shows
a few broken ribs.

12:31.663 --> 12:33.013
Head wound is superficial.

12:33.056 --> 12:34.449
Okay, that's good news.

12:34.492 --> 12:35.972
Who is that?

12:36.016 --> 12:37.626
Hey, Kevin, can you
turn the camera?

12:37.669 --> 12:40.411
Uh, hello. I'm Dr. Griffith.
I didn't see you there.

12:40.455 --> 12:42.065
Kevin's parents,
I presume?

12:42.109 --> 12:44.067
Yeah, hi.
Randy and

12:44.111 --> 12:46.417
Cathy Dunn. They went to the
corner deli and got stranded.

12:46.461 --> 12:47.810
Ah.

12:47.854 --> 12:48.942
Look, we were only
supposed to be gone

12:48.985 --> 12:50.334
ten minutes.
20, tops.

12:50.378 --> 12:51.335
Plows are just taking forever.

12:51.379 --> 12:52.902
What do we pay taxes for?

12:52.946 --> 12:54.121
Randy and Cathy
tell me that there's

12:54.164 --> 12:55.644
nothing of note
in Kevin's

12:55.687 --> 12:57.733
medical history,
but they have a pontoon,

12:57.777 --> 12:59.256
so it's been productive.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.302
Huh. Hey, Kevin,

13:01.345 --> 13:03.391
How are you feeling?
How's your breathing?

13:03.434 --> 13:05.785
Bad. My chest hurts.

13:05.828 --> 13:08.265
- Mom... Mom,
- I'm right here, sweetie.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.877
Why is he so pale?

13:10.920 --> 13:13.270
- What's happening?
- I'm not getting a heartbeat.

13:13.314 --> 13:14.402
What?
How could he have no heartbeat?

13:14.445 --> 13:15.533
He's sitting there talking.

13:15.577 --> 13:16.752
May I have your arm?

13:18.232 --> 13:19.276
I've got
a pulse here.

13:20.538 --> 13:22.540
Dextrocardia?

13:22.584 --> 13:23.977
Wasn't there a minute ago.

13:24.020 --> 13:25.456
Pressure in the pleural cavity

13:25.500 --> 13:27.719
could have turned the heart.90 degrees?

13:27.763 --> 13:29.069
I need a thoracostomy kit

13:29.112 --> 13:30.418
and an ultrasound in here.

13:30.461 --> 13:31.506
Randy, Cathy, we're gonna

13:31.549 --> 13:32.986
- - have to call you back.
- Wh-
- What?

13:33.029 --> 13:34.378
You can't be here
for this procedure.

13:34.422 --> 13:35.423
We don't have
any available nurses.

13:35.466 --> 13:36.511
I'll get
the kit myself.

13:36.554 --> 13:37.860
I-I'm not hanging up.

13:37.904 --> 13:38.948
You just said he doesn't
have a heartbeat.

13:38.992 --> 13:40.471
Well, no,
he's got one.

13:40.515 --> 13:41.733
It's just on the wrong side
of his chest.

13:41.777 --> 13:43.083
What?

13:44.084 --> 13:45.346
I don't know
what to tell you.

13:45.389 --> 13:46.303
Your potassium
is off the charts.

13:46.347 --> 13:47.914
I know, I know.

13:47.957 --> 13:51.004
Forgive me, father,
for I have sinned.

13:51.047 --> 13:52.832
What you have
is end-stage renal failure.

13:55.225 --> 13:56.705
Ooh!

13:56.748 --> 13:59.142
She should be in jail for
attempted homicide.

14:02.363 --> 14:03.451
Sorry?

14:03.494 --> 14:06.410
The bus driver. You her doctor?

14:07.847 --> 14:08.848
Yes, ma'am.

14:08.891 --> 14:11.154
Tell her she has got a date

14:11.198 --> 14:12.764
with the business end
of my umbrella,

14:12.808 --> 14:14.549
soon as I get out
of here.

14:14.592 --> 14:16.290
Simmer down now, Carla,

14:16.333 --> 14:17.813
you don't need
high blood pressure

14:17.857 --> 14:19.554
on top of everything else.
Dr. Costa,

14:19.597 --> 14:20.860
why does your patient
want to attack

14:20.903 --> 14:22.296
my patient with an umbrella?

14:22.339 --> 14:24.864
And which end
is the business end?

14:24.907 --> 14:26.256
And I am going
to sue her.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.605
Tell her,
would you?

14:27.649 --> 14:29.912
The roads are very bad
out there.

14:29.956 --> 14:33.133
Roads have nothing
to do with it.

14:33.176 --> 14:35.744
She was asleep at the wheel.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.922
Wait. Literally asleep?

14:39.966 --> 14:41.054
You saw this?

14:41.097 --> 14:43.534
I saw it with my own eyes.

14:43.578 --> 14:44.884
I was in the first row.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.973
I saw her.

14:47.016 --> 14:49.192
I even poked her
with my umbrella.

14:49.236 --> 14:50.454
Nothing.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.849
She wasn't knocked unconscious
by the crash.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.373
She crashed because
she was unconscious.

14:56.417 --> 14:58.114
Take a bus. Whoa.

14:58.158 --> 14:59.594
Fill it with money

14:59.637 --> 15:01.683
'cause that's how much
I'm suing her for.

15:01.726 --> 15:03.380
Mm-hmm.

15:05.382 --> 15:07.167
Yep.

15:07.210 --> 15:10.039
Nurse Opal,
fosphenytoin, please.

15:11.562 --> 15:13.825
No bleed
according to her scan.

15:13.869 --> 15:14.914
But according
to one of the passengers,

15:14.957 --> 15:16.132
she blacked out at the wheel.

15:16.176 --> 15:18.352
I'm loading her up
on fosphenytoin.

15:18.395 --> 15:19.440
The meds
you asked for.

15:19.483 --> 15:21.398
What causes
a generalized

15:21.442 --> 15:24.836
onset seizure that
doesn't show up on a CT scan?

15:24.880 --> 15:27.491
Could be a reaction
to medication she's on. Stroke?

15:27.535 --> 15:29.841
- Meningitis?
- Mm, we could do a lumbar puncture

15:29.885 --> 15:31.104
- to rule out infection.
- Okay.

15:31.147 --> 15:33.497
She's not epileptic, is she?

15:33.541 --> 15:35.238
No MedicAlert band.

15:37.719 --> 15:38.763
13th.

15:39.895 --> 15:41.766
She's Air Force.

15:41.810 --> 15:42.942
Like you.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.075
A lot of ways to get
a traumatic brain injury

15:46.119 --> 15:47.685
when you're
in the military,

15:47.729 --> 15:49.209
especially if you
saw combat.

15:49.252 --> 15:50.993
Hmm.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.647
Once the meds
kick in

15:52.690 --> 15:54.823
and she's responsive,
we can take her history.

15:54.866 --> 15:57.565
Find out what might've
- caused the seizure.
- Yeah.

15:57.608 --> 15:59.654
I'm gonna wait
with her.

16:01.177 --> 16:03.310
She's not gonna know where
she is when she wakes up.

16:03.353 --> 16:04.746
Might not even know
there was a crash.

16:04.789 --> 16:06.443
Or that she caused it.

16:07.923 --> 16:09.751
- Poor thing.
- Yeah.

16:09.794 --> 16:11.187
Thank you.

16:17.063 --> 16:18.673
Donna, is this the overflow?

16:18.716 --> 16:21.154
I just take
what they send up.

16:21.197 --> 16:23.156
I had no idea it was
this crowded up here,

16:23.199 --> 16:24.722
and you're
by yourself.

16:24.766 --> 16:26.507
- I'm gonna get you some help.
- It's butterfly stitches

16:26.550 --> 16:28.422
and tetanus shots. I got this.

16:28.465 --> 16:29.945
Do you know that you
are the best person?

16:29.989 --> 16:32.165
Well, that must be why
they pay me so well.

16:32.208 --> 16:33.775
Right.
And besides,

16:33.818 --> 16:35.777
I'm not alone.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.866
Why don't you sit right there?
There you go.

16:39.172 --> 16:41.043
My head is bleeding
real bad.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.697
Okay, I got you.
All right.

16:42.740 --> 16:44.090
Hey, Donna,
patient with the

16:44.133 --> 16:45.917
dislocated shoulder
is asking for you.

16:45.961 --> 16:48.398
Oh, he needs an ice pack.
I'll be right there, Eddy.

16:48.442 --> 16:49.878
Did you do this?

16:49.921 --> 16:51.749
Uh, no. This is all Donna.

16:51.793 --> 16:53.447
I'm just trying
to stay out of her way.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.362
Right. Do you guys
need anything up here?

16:55.405 --> 16:58.234
We are good. You need anything?

16:58.278 --> 17:00.062
I could use about
100 units of blood.

17:01.063 --> 17:03.196
Caleb's doing an inventory
of our blood bank,

17:03.239 --> 17:04.762
but with this much
influx of trauma,

17:04.806 --> 17:06.068
it's safe to say
we're gonna run out.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.114
I can make
some calls.

17:08.157 --> 17:10.159
See if there's any hospitals
with spare blood.

17:10.203 --> 17:12.074
Piedmont and St. Mary's
are the closest,

17:12.118 --> 17:14.207
- so I can start with them.
- Thank you.

17:14.250 --> 17:15.599
Yeah.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.907
So, the thoracostomy has

17:18.950 --> 17:21.083
successfully relieved
the pressure on his chest,

17:21.127 --> 17:24.086
and his heart is, uh, shifting
back towards the right side.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.088
- The right side?
- Yeah, your right or his right?

17:26.132 --> 17:28.873
Uh, to the right side.
I mean, his left s-side.

17:28.917 --> 17:31.659
Sorry, sorry. I understand
how that could be confusing.

17:31.702 --> 17:33.008
Is he gonna be okay?

17:33.052 --> 17:34.053
When can I go home?

17:34.096 --> 17:35.228
Where is his heart?

17:35.271 --> 17:36.577
It's where it's supposed to be.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.231
So everything is back to normal?

17:38.274 --> 17:39.623
I wouldn't say that.

17:39.667 --> 17:42.365
The heart's nearly back
in position, but

17:42.409 --> 17:45.716
that movement has caused
the arteries to get in a tangle,

17:45.760 --> 17:47.370
and he may need surgery
to correct it.

17:47.414 --> 17:49.590
- What, surgery?
- Heart surgery?

17:49.633 --> 17:51.940
Mm-hmm.
- Widened mediastinum.

17:51.983 --> 17:53.811
With an irregular
aortic contour.

17:53.855 --> 17:56.031
I'm waiting
for the CT angio.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.685
Why didn't you
tell me this sooner?

17:57.728 --> 17:59.469
Uh... I would've called,

17:59.513 --> 18:00.731
but Kevin has my phone.

18:00.775 --> 18:02.124
I don't want to have
heart surgery.

18:03.560 --> 18:04.779
I want to go home.

18:04.822 --> 18:06.476
I know.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.174
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart.

18:08.217 --> 18:09.827
Okay, what-what
is the surgery, exactly?

18:09.871 --> 18:13.004
Well, it, uh, depends on
the severity of the damage,

18:13.048 --> 18:15.006
and as I said,
until we get imaging...

18:15.050 --> 18:16.921
Okay, can you walk us through
all the scenarios?

18:16.965 --> 18:18.662
Sure.
- Wait, let me get a pen.

18:18.706 --> 18:20.664
Hold on, she's getting a pen.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.101
What happened?

18:23.493 --> 18:24.494
- Wi-
- Fi's out.

18:24.538 --> 18:25.887
And you have, like, no bars.

18:25.930 --> 18:28.585
How am I supposed
to talk to my parents?

18:28.629 --> 18:29.499
Um...

18:29.543 --> 18:30.674
I...

18:30.718 --> 18:32.328
I don't think
you can.

18:32.372 --> 18:33.721
I'm sorry.

18:35.549 --> 18:37.986
Yeah. Uh, hey, Kevin,
I'm gonna be right back,

18:38.029 --> 18:39.161
- okay?
- Me, too.

18:39.205 --> 18:41.859
No. I think you
should stay here.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.776
I think Dr. Costa
needs our assistance.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.691
Imaging will be back any time.

18:47.735 --> 18:50.694
If the phones are down, I need
to be able to find you quickly.

18:50.738 --> 18:53.175
Run pre-op labs just in case.

18:53.219 --> 18:56.047
You want me to do
a blood draw myself?

18:57.745 --> 18:59.050
Be better.

19:07.015 --> 19:08.582
Anything, Donna?

19:08.625 --> 19:09.931
I'm messaging dispatch
right now.

19:09.974 --> 19:11.237
What's going on?

19:11.280 --> 19:12.977
Dispatch sent Tim on
a call an hour ago

19:13.021 --> 19:14.979
to North Corktown and then
lost contact with his rig.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.198
No.

19:16.242 --> 19:17.678
He's supposed
to check in.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.419
He promised that he was
gonna check in.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.421
- But cell service is down.
- Yeah, well, radios should work.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.336
They might not in a storm
like this. It's bad.

19:23.379 --> 19:25.860
I know it's a bad storm,
but he's supposed to check in.

19:25.903 --> 19:27.862
Okay.

19:27.905 --> 19:28.950
- All right.
- What is it?

19:28.993 --> 19:30.212
Dispatch just sent a bulletin.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.171
- Uh-huh.
- Another wreck, looks like

19:32.214 --> 19:33.955
an overpass collapsed on I-75.

19:33.998 --> 19:35.174
Where on I-75?

19:38.525 --> 19:40.179
I can't get the news.

19:40.222 --> 19:41.963
- Hospital Wi-
- Fi's down. What does the bulletin say?

19:42.964 --> 19:45.140
I-75 and...

19:45.184 --> 19:46.620
Trumbull Avenue.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.188
Corktown.

19:52.887 --> 19:54.541
How many people have you killed?

19:55.585 --> 19:57.587
How many people have <i>you</i> killed?

19:58.936 --> 20:00.677
People die in surgery.

20:00.721 --> 20:02.984
People die in bus crashes.
You're on a lucky streak, kid.

20:04.159 --> 20:05.421
What happens if I die?

20:05.465 --> 20:08.076
Well, that would be
very bad for me.

20:08.119 --> 20:09.947
For you?

20:09.991 --> 20:12.298
Kevin, I'm one of the top-rated
surgeons in the country.

20:12.341 --> 20:14.517
That's according to <i>U.S. News</i> <i>
and World Report.</i>

20:15.866 --> 20:17.303
I don't know what that is.

20:17.346 --> 20:20.131
It's a big deal.
It's a very competitive list.

20:20.175 --> 20:21.785
And you know how
you get on there?

20:21.829 --> 20:23.178
Patients not dying?

20:23.222 --> 20:25.224
Exactly.

20:25.267 --> 20:27.443
It's one of the first things
they look at.

20:27.487 --> 20:30.141
Do you think my parents
will sue you if I die?

20:31.317 --> 20:33.406
You know what?

20:33.449 --> 20:34.842
I'm not doing your surgery.

20:34.885 --> 20:36.496
Why not?

20:36.539 --> 20:38.062
Well, it's too much
of a risk for me.

20:38.106 --> 20:39.412
You seem pretty sure
you're gonna die,

20:39.455 --> 20:41.196
and, uh, it'd be very bad
for my record.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.241
I-I won't die.

20:42.284 --> 20:43.546
What if you do?

20:43.590 --> 20:45.418
I won't. Please.

20:46.941 --> 20:49.335
It's just, my reputation's
very important to me.

20:49.378 --> 20:50.814
I promise I'm not gonna die.

20:55.210 --> 20:56.298
Okay.

20:56.342 --> 20:58.213
But I'm gonna
hold you to that,

20:58.257 --> 20:59.519
you understand?

21:16.492 --> 21:17.624
What are you doing?

21:17.667 --> 21:20.366
I was told
to gather supplies.

21:20.409 --> 21:21.845
That's my personal
first aid kit.

21:21.889 --> 21:23.020
Not today.

21:23.064 --> 21:25.588
What if I need a flashlight?

21:25.632 --> 21:27.242
Talk to her.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.810
I got imaging back
on Kevin. It's bad.

21:32.378 --> 21:35.250
All right, we got to prep
an OR now.

21:36.251 --> 21:37.774
Hey.

21:44.694 --> 21:45.869
Kevin Dunn. 12 years old.

21:45.913 --> 21:47.436
Type A aortic dissection.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.090
He's being prepped
for surgery now. Question is

21:49.133 --> 21:50.309
whether the valve
is involved.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.527
His echo shows trace
aortic regurge.

21:51.571 --> 21:53.399
I say we repair
the dissection

21:53.442 --> 21:54.748
with a dacron graft.

21:54.791 --> 21:56.445
I disagree.
I say we go Bentall.

21:56.489 --> 21:58.926
Bentall's a six-hour procedure
on a good day.

21:58.969 --> 22:00.144
Graft is four,

22:00.188 --> 22:01.581
tops.
Highly preferable.

22:01.624 --> 22:03.104
Unless the valve is involved.

22:03.147 --> 22:04.323
So, we do the graft.
If the valve

22:04.366 --> 22:05.846
is involved,
we re-suspend

22:05.889 --> 22:08.979
and we repair most
of the valve right there.

22:09.023 --> 22:10.677
We have to do better
than "most."

22:10.720 --> 22:12.679
Do you want to open this kid up
again in a couple of years?

22:12.722 --> 22:14.158
Sam, the power's
on the blink.

22:14.202 --> 22:15.725
Half the hospital is
running on generators.

22:15.769 --> 22:17.553
Time is of
the essence here.

22:17.597 --> 22:19.773
The shorter the procedure,
the lower the risk to this kid.

22:22.123 --> 22:23.080
Okay.

22:23.124 --> 22:24.560
We do the graft,

22:24.604 --> 22:26.432
but I want to be prepared
to maneuver to a Bentall

22:26.475 --> 22:28.347
if the valve is involved.
No re-suspension.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.523
Deal.

22:37.268 --> 22:39.880
Hello,
my old friend.

22:43.884 --> 22:45.146
What's wrong?

22:46.756 --> 22:48.497
I'm the one
with a hole in my neck.

22:50.151 --> 22:52.022
My fiancé's stuck in the storm.

22:52.066 --> 22:53.241
He was the one
that brought you in.

22:53.284 --> 22:56.810
Oh. What a handsome fella.

22:56.853 --> 22:58.594
He seemed so nice.

22:58.638 --> 23:01.423
Yeah, he is.

23:01.467 --> 23:03.730
And the last thing I did
was mock him for loving me.

23:04.731 --> 23:06.950
Hmm.

23:13.435 --> 23:16.264
Power out or something?

23:16.307 --> 23:17.831
No.

23:17.874 --> 23:19.746
Plus we have
multiple generators.

23:19.789 --> 23:21.312
Water's not flowing.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.404
The pipes are frozen.

23:30.974 --> 23:33.890
God, I can't believe I did this.

23:35.065 --> 23:37.416
I don't remember anything.

23:39.113 --> 23:41.202
These are the medications
you take?

23:42.246 --> 23:44.248
Yeah, why?

23:44.292 --> 23:46.207
It's just...

23:46.250 --> 23:48.252
quetiapine is
an antipsychotic.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.081
What are you
taking it for?

23:51.125 --> 23:53.344
Mood swings.

23:57.131 --> 23:59.002
Bipolar's the technical term.

23:59.046 --> 24:01.091
You know, there's nothing
to be ashamed of.

24:01.135 --> 24:03.311
It's more common
than you think.

24:03.354 --> 24:05.052
Especially
with veterans.

24:06.053 --> 24:07.924
I don't like talking
about my service.

24:07.968 --> 24:10.797
No? Not even
with a fellow airman?

24:10.840 --> 24:13.190
No kidding.

24:13.234 --> 24:14.235
Mm-hmm.

24:14.278 --> 24:15.715
Medic?
Yes.

24:15.758 --> 24:17.064
I was Avionics.

24:17.107 --> 24:18.892
Staff sergeant. Wow.

24:18.935 --> 24:20.981
Why'd you enlist?

24:21.024 --> 24:23.505
Let's just say

24:23.549 --> 24:25.551
there was no money
for college.

24:25.594 --> 24:27.988
So I joined the Air Force,
did my time,

24:28.031 --> 24:30.381
then went to school
on Uncle Sam's dime.

24:30.425 --> 24:32.340
He can be a good sugar daddy.

24:32.383 --> 24:34.647
Honey.

24:35.996 --> 24:38.738
Looks like things turned out
better for you than me

24:38.781 --> 24:41.001
after discharge.

24:41.044 --> 24:43.351
This psychiatrist said
that he could help.

24:43.394 --> 24:44.874
But the new meds
that he's got me on

24:44.918 --> 24:46.528
have just made
everything worse.

24:46.572 --> 24:47.834
Wait, "new"?

24:47.877 --> 24:49.357
So the symptoms
are recent?

24:49.400 --> 24:51.446
Yeah.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.404
Just in the last few months.

24:53.448 --> 24:55.972
Okay, that might help
explain what's going on.

24:57.365 --> 24:59.846
Can the new meds
explain this?

25:04.459 --> 25:06.113
- Any word from your mom?
- No.

25:06.156 --> 25:08.071
It's so weird to be
so mad at her

25:08.115 --> 25:09.725
and worried about her
at the same time.

25:09.769 --> 25:11.553
St. Mary's can give us
30 units of blood.

25:11.597 --> 25:12.902
- Oh!
- That would help.

25:12.946 --> 25:14.425
Uh, yes, uh,
but there is a problem.

25:14.469 --> 25:15.644
They can't get it to us.

25:15.688 --> 25:17.559
The bridge collapse
has all the roads

25:17.603 --> 25:19.169
in Wayne County backed up.

25:19.213 --> 25:21.607
So we're gonna have
to start rationing blood.

25:21.650 --> 25:23.130
Everything we have

25:23.173 --> 25:24.958
is already in
the hospital. Yeah.

25:25.001 --> 25:27.613
- Wait, that, that's a good point.
- What do you mean?

25:27.656 --> 25:29.963
We have blood, or-or at least
we have blood donors.

25:30.006 --> 25:31.573
We could do a blood drive.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.314
I don't know how many
phlebotomists we have...

25:33.357 --> 25:35.229
I-I got Donna.
I can help.

25:35.272 --> 25:37.579
It takes about four hours
to screen and process.

25:37.623 --> 25:38.711
The more arms we stick,
the better.

25:39.973 --> 25:41.409
Let's get started.

25:42.715 --> 25:44.891
Okay.

25:46.109 --> 25:48.111
- Joey.
- Hey.

25:48.155 --> 25:50.287
I've never seen pelvic bleeding
like this before.

25:50.331 --> 25:52.159
I can't get it to stop.

25:52.202 --> 25:53.769
Yeah, and I can't get
the dialysis machine
to run without water.

25:53.813 --> 25:55.728
Do you think it's fibroids
causing the bleeding?

25:55.771 --> 25:57.643
Maybe, or a malignancy.

25:57.686 --> 25:59.296
I'm running
an STD panel, too.

25:59.340 --> 26:01.603
That tends to get overlooked
with older patients.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.474
I need water.
The pipes are frozen.

26:03.518 --> 26:05.085
I'm gonna call maintenance,
but I don't...
Oh, no, no, no.

26:05.128 --> 26:06.826
You can't wait
for maintenance, uh...

26:06.869 --> 26:08.305
What about the tanks
in the wellness center?

26:08.349 --> 26:10.046
Yeah, no,
they're filled with water.

26:10.090 --> 26:11.526
But then how am I supposed
to get it out, sterilize it,

26:11.570 --> 26:12.745
and then feed it
into the machine?

26:12.788 --> 26:15.182
It's pumps and hoses.

26:15.225 --> 26:16.966
Just like heart surgery.

26:17.010 --> 26:19.490
You'll figure it out.

26:21.754 --> 26:23.799
<i>Hola. ¿Hablas español?</i>

26:28.543 --> 26:31.328
No? Okay... <i>
Hola.</i>

26:31.372 --> 26:33.287
<i>Hola.</i> <i>
Hola.</i>

26:45.429 --> 26:47.388
Okay, <i>muchas gracias.</i>

26:48.389 --> 26:50.739
Okay, can you collect here?
Okay.

26:51.827 --> 26:53.655
You speak Spanish.

26:53.699 --> 26:56.440
Yeah, I did a little, uh,
volunteer work in Colombia

26:56.484 --> 26:57.964
- after med school.
- Mm.

26:58.007 --> 26:59.487
What?

26:59.530 --> 27:02.185
I just didn't take you
as a volunteer type.

27:02.229 --> 27:04.840
I'm literally volunteering

27:04.884 --> 27:06.668
right now with this blood drive.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.888
Yeah.
And, uh...

27:08.931 --> 27:11.020
well, look, also,
to be honest...

27:11.064 --> 27:14.023
the club scene
in Cartagena was huge.

27:14.067 --> 27:16.330
Really?

27:16.373 --> 27:18.854
<i>Sí, señor.</i>

27:18.898 --> 27:21.901
Now I'm opening Kevin's
ascending aorta.

27:21.944 --> 27:25.600
Let's see what we've got.

27:28.429 --> 27:30.692
Damn it. The valve.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.563
It's too damaged
to reconstruct.

27:32.607 --> 27:34.957
Bentall it is. You were right.

27:35.001 --> 27:37.264
We were both right.

27:37.307 --> 27:39.483
Let's cut out the damaged
tissue. Cooley scissors to me.

27:41.616 --> 27:43.836
All right, I'm gonna see
if I can, uh, find her sister.

27:43.879 --> 27:44.924
Yeah.

27:54.542 --> 27:56.022
Power's out.

27:56.065 --> 27:57.763
Emergency lightsare on.

27:57.806 --> 27:59.721
Generator will kick on
any second.

28:08.469 --> 28:10.384
Generator's back on.

28:20.394 --> 28:21.787
Sam?

28:21.830 --> 28:23.832
If the power's not
back by now...

28:23.876 --> 28:25.312
It's not coming back.

28:25.355 --> 28:26.792
The generator in
this cell must have failed.

28:26.835 --> 28:29.403
And we have a six-hour surgery
ahead of us.

28:38.238 --> 28:39.718
Begin emergency procedures.

28:39.761 --> 28:40.849
I need hand cranks on bypass
right now.

28:40.893 --> 28:42.633
Once we're up to 50% reserves,

28:42.677 --> 28:44.374
start manual circulation.

28:44.418 --> 28:46.768
Can we move him
to another OR?He can't leave a sterile

28:46.812 --> 28:48.509
environment with his chest
open. If I close him up

28:48.552 --> 28:50.685
without repairing
this dissection, he will die.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.252
I need to repair
his descending aorta

28:52.295 --> 28:54.994
and get him off bypass,
but I need light!

28:55.037 --> 28:57.213
What, something like this?

29:01.783 --> 29:04.090
Here you go.

29:04.133 --> 29:05.787
Oh, thank God.

29:05.831 --> 29:08.050
Now, those hand cranks have
to turn in perfect sync

29:08.094 --> 29:09.573
- or he'll turn acidotic.
- Here.

29:09.617 --> 29:11.184
I want some ice packs
in here!

29:11.227 --> 29:12.620
Put 'em on his head
and limbs.

29:12.663 --> 29:14.143
And the machine tubes, too.

29:14.187 --> 29:16.406
Hey! Move!
We're not losing this kid today.

29:16.450 --> 29:18.495
Thank you.

29:18.539 --> 29:20.759
I'm just holding the line.

29:23.283 --> 29:25.198
The Bentall's too risky now.

29:25.241 --> 29:27.069
So re-suspend
and preserve the native valve.

29:27.113 --> 29:28.549
What if it doesn't work?

29:28.592 --> 29:30.769
It will work.

29:32.683 --> 29:34.468
11 blade.

29:40.213 --> 29:41.954
Hey.
Hey.

29:41.997 --> 29:43.825
Carla is on dialysis
as we speak.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.174
You figured it out.

29:45.218 --> 29:47.089
Turns out I'm not
just a great doctor.

29:47.133 --> 29:48.699
I'm also
an excellent plumber.

29:48.743 --> 29:51.006
Well, Dorothy's
labs are back.

29:51.050 --> 29:53.748
- Hmm.
- Everything's negative except for her pregnancy test.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.576
The bus driver?
- How old is she?
- Uh-huh.

29:55.619 --> 29:57.839
- 68.
- Wow, that's what I call an advanced maternal age.

29:57.883 --> 29:59.841
Yeah, well, that's what
I call a false positive.

29:59.885 --> 30:01.800
Something's messing with her
hormones, making her think

30:01.843 --> 30:03.366
that she's pregnant, and
- I don't know what it is.
- Excuse me, guys.

30:03.410 --> 30:05.238
- Hey.
- Blood drive, huh?

30:05.281 --> 30:07.283
We gonna put a pair
of scrubs on you soon.

30:07.327 --> 30:09.024
Donna already tried.

30:09.068 --> 30:10.809
Aren't you working
with Caleb?

30:10.852 --> 30:12.723
How's that
going for you?

30:14.943 --> 30:16.553
Oh.

30:16.597 --> 30:18.425
Would you focus
on your patient?

30:18.468 --> 30:20.993
Hey, if that story ends in a
slap fight, somebody page me.

30:21.036 --> 30:22.646
You know I will.
Mm-hmm.

30:24.387 --> 30:27.608
So the test says
- I'm pregnant.
- Right.

30:27.651 --> 30:29.697
- But I'm not pregnant.
- Uh-uh.

30:29.740 --> 30:31.481
But you're doing an ultrasound,

30:31.525 --> 30:33.222
which is what they do
when you're pregnant.

30:33.266 --> 30:34.658
It's what we do
when we need to see

30:34.702 --> 30:35.964
what's going on
inside of you, Sarge.

30:38.358 --> 30:39.489
Gotcha.

30:39.533 --> 30:41.709
Complex ovarian cyst.

30:41.752 --> 30:43.450
Tiny, but I think this
could be our answer.

30:43.493 --> 30:44.886
You want to book
an OR to remove it?

30:44.930 --> 30:46.540
Normally I would say yes,
but her vitals

30:46.583 --> 30:48.585
are all over the map.
Her pressure's so low.

30:48.629 --> 30:51.110
She just hasn't
stopped bleeding.

30:51.153 --> 30:53.677
She's going into
hemorrhagic shock.

30:53.721 --> 30:55.941
- She needs blood.
- Well, the donor blood should be processed soon.

30:55.984 --> 30:57.464
We can't wait for that--
what about the blood bank?

30:57.507 --> 30:58.857
Yeah, that's gonna be
a little harder.

31:05.472 --> 31:06.777
Hey.

31:06.821 --> 31:08.649
Mm.

31:08.692 --> 31:11.304
I usually feel better by now.

31:11.347 --> 31:14.437
Your body responded
to the dialysis, but your EKG

31:14.481 --> 31:17.092
shows signs
of ischemia.

31:17.136 --> 31:19.225
Your heart is starving
for oxygen because...

31:19.268 --> 31:22.881
Because... I waited too long.

31:24.447 --> 31:28.060
I just wanted
to see my grandson.

31:28.103 --> 31:29.757
I thought
I could

31:29.800 --> 31:31.933
get by this one time.

31:33.282 --> 31:35.241
I think we can turn this around.

31:35.284 --> 31:38.200
But you do need
a blood transfusion.

31:38.244 --> 31:39.941
So...

31:39.985 --> 31:41.943
hang in there, okay?

31:41.987 --> 31:45.033
When you see
your paramedic,

31:45.077 --> 31:47.818
tell him I said thank you

31:47.862 --> 31:50.821
for taking such good care of me.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.913
You're gonna tell him yourself.

32:01.136 --> 32:02.964
Hemo's 7.9.
Vitals are dropping.

32:03.008 --> 32:04.400
Where is the blood I asked for?

32:04.444 --> 32:06.359
Here it is.
- We're down to 7.5.

32:06.402 --> 32:08.709
- Let's transfuse.
- The units from the blood drive

32:08.752 --> 32:10.276
should be ready
within the hour.

32:10.319 --> 32:11.930
Until then,
this is all I've got.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.933
That's all the blood
left in this hospital?

32:14.976 --> 32:17.587
Yes, and I have three requests
for it, all stat.

32:17.631 --> 32:19.241
What are the other requests?

32:19.285 --> 32:21.200
Dr. Trulie
and Dr. Costa.

32:21.243 --> 32:22.984
Hemorrhagic shock
and acute ischemic

32:23.028 --> 32:25.030
- heart disease.
- We're down to 6.9.

32:25.073 --> 32:26.814
How do I make this call?

32:26.857 --> 32:28.598
You want me to do it?

32:28.642 --> 32:30.296
No.

32:30.339 --> 32:31.906
It has to be me.

32:34.996 --> 32:36.955
Hmm.

32:36.998 --> 32:38.086
If he doesn't get this blood...

32:38.130 --> 32:40.045
It's a death sentence, I know.

32:40.088 --> 32:41.568
Blood's gonna be ready
in an hour.

32:41.611 --> 32:42.961
I need to buy
the other two more time.

32:43.004 --> 32:45.311
Dr. Trulie can try IV Premarin.

32:45.354 --> 32:47.139
That's a good idea. Hormones
might slow the active bleeding.

32:47.182 --> 32:50.490
Tell Dr. Costa to put
his patient on 100% oxygen.

32:50.533 --> 32:52.927
It might just keep her alive
long enough to get the next

32:52.971 --> 32:54.146
units of blood.

32:54.189 --> 32:56.713
That blood stays with Kevin.

33:07.855 --> 33:10.771
Come on, Sarge.

I lived.

What'd I tell you?

35:27.777 --> 35:29.605
Why are we still in here?

35:29.649 --> 35:31.912
And why is it so dark?

35:31.955 --> 35:34.088
Well, the power's still out.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.134
And we can't move you till...

35:36.177 --> 35:38.048
the elevator's working, and...

35:38.092 --> 35:39.963
you are safer

35:41.487 --> 35:43.271
Creepy how?

35:45.230 --> 35:47.841
Are my parents here yet?

35:48.929 --> 35:50.539
No.

35:51.714 --> 35:53.325
The weather's still bad.

35:53.368 --> 35:55.283
And the phones are still down.

35:55.327 --> 35:58.199
You are on the other side of it.

35:58.243 --> 36:00.201
- So you get some rest.
- Wait.

36:00.245 --> 36:02.203
Where are you going? You can't
leave me alone in here.

36:02.247 --> 36:03.944
You're not alone.
There's a nurse

36:03.987 --> 36:06.164
- right behind there.
- Can you stay with me?

36:06.207 --> 36:07.774
No.

36:08.905 --> 36:10.951
Just until
I fall asleep?

37:18.192 --> 37:20.629
Better than the surgeons'
lounge. Residents all take

37:20.673 --> 37:23.284
their shoes off, it gets
kind of suffocating.

37:23.328 --> 37:25.025
You know?
Mm-hmm.

37:25.068 --> 37:26.679
And the kid asked me to, so...

37:27.854 --> 37:29.899
Yeah, he clearly needed
a parent.

37:29.943 --> 37:31.858
Yeah.

37:31.901 --> 37:33.947
And, uh...

37:36.428 --> 37:38.473
...so did you.

37:38.517 --> 37:40.432
I pushed you away.

37:40.475 --> 37:42.303
Because I-I was...

37:42.347 --> 37:44.610
I don't know...

37:44.653 --> 37:46.307
punishing myself or something.

37:46.351 --> 37:48.004
I didn't think I deserved...

37:48.048 --> 37:49.571
Okay.

37:49.615 --> 37:51.660
Look, no, I'm sorry.
I won't bring it up

37:51.704 --> 37:53.445
until you're ready.

37:53.488 --> 37:56.012
We'll talk about it
on your timeline, not mine.

37:57.884 --> 38:00.582
I guess Pyne's really
earning his paycheck, huh?

38:01.844 --> 38:04.412
Right. But...

38:04.456 --> 38:06.458
this kid?

38:06.501 --> 38:08.329
He had a tough night.

38:08.373 --> 38:10.592
You were never...

38:10.636 --> 38:12.028
that alone.

38:12.072 --> 38:13.552
I may not have
been there.

38:13.595 --> 38:16.032
But your mother was...
always there.

38:16.076 --> 38:17.295
Okay, Dad... No.

38:17.338 --> 38:19.558
- I'm asking you, Sam, please.
- Please...

38:19.601 --> 38:22.517
Talk to her.

38:29.002 --> 38:32.353
So I was pregnant with that?

38:32.397 --> 38:34.268
Mm-hmm, it's called
a teratoma.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.966
It secreted hormones that read
as a positive pregnancy test.

38:37.010 --> 38:39.055
It also grew brain tissue

38:39.099 --> 38:41.928
that sent out signals
interfering with your own brain.

38:41.971 --> 38:44.583
This is what caused
your blackout.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.979
Oh, the accident.

38:50.023 --> 38:51.720
All those people.

38:51.764 --> 38:54.636
There was nothing
you could do, Sarge.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.466
It was not your fault.

39:00.468 --> 39:02.818
Thank you, Airman.

39:07.388 --> 39:09.738
Hold on.

39:09.782 --> 39:12.262
Is that a tooth?

39:16.179 --> 39:17.746
I'll...
Gah!

39:17.790 --> 39:19.400
Yeah, I'm sorry.

39:19.444 --> 39:20.923
Uh, with these eight,
- we're up to 94.
- Good.

39:20.967 --> 39:22.272
96.

39:22.316 --> 39:24.100
Right, yeah, math.

39:24.144 --> 39:26.494
Yeah, you cover the arm
sticking, I cover the numbers.

39:28.148 --> 39:30.063
Wow, and here I thought
this would be awkward.

39:33.283 --> 39:35.068
Sorry, that was rude.

39:35.111 --> 39:37.418
I'm just trying to get
my mind off...

39:42.249 --> 39:44.294
Tim.

39:47.646 --> 39:49.778
I'm sorry about the rings.

39:49.822 --> 39:51.476
Oh, no, no, I'm sorry
about the rings.

39:51.519 --> 39:54.740
If I were the crying type,
I'd be misty right now.

39:54.783 --> 39:58.396
Hmm, see, you definitely
strike me as the crying type.

40:00.746 --> 40:02.704
Hey.
Hi.

40:05.490 --> 40:07.666
Want some coffee?

40:07.709 --> 40:10.799
No, I think I just want a nap.

40:12.235 --> 40:13.759
You were good today.

40:13.802 --> 40:16.109
<i>We</i> were good today.

40:16.152 --> 40:17.937
Together.

40:17.980 --> 40:20.461
Yeah.

40:24.204 --> 40:26.728
Tim, oh, my God!

40:26.772 --> 40:29.514
I'm so excited you're okay.
Aah! Let go of me!

40:29.557 --> 40:31.864
- Hey.
- Oh, it's so good to see you.

40:31.907 --> 40:33.431
Oh, thanks.

40:34.867 --> 40:38.087
Joey, I'm sorry about your
patient-- that was a hard call.

40:38.131 --> 40:40.568
There just wasn't enough blood.

40:40.612 --> 40:43.441
And yet your patient got some.

40:45.007 --> 40:48.054
44 patients survived.

40:48.097 --> 40:50.186
We lost power,
we lost water.

40:50.230 --> 40:52.841
Uh, we ran out of blood and...

40:52.885 --> 40:55.191
we still saved 44 lives.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.848
- And the Wi-
- Fi's back on.

40:59.892 --> 41:01.981
As we wait to hear
more about this deadly crash,

41:02.024 --> 41:03.678
emergency workers
have finally gained

41:03.722 --> 41:07.073
access to the victims
of the I-75 overpass collapse.

41:07.116 --> 41:10.250
Ambulances are standing by in
the hopes of finding survivors.

41:10.293 --> 41:12.034
Little is known... Are you seeing this?

41:12.078 --> 41:13.949
It's awful.

41:13.993 --> 41:15.821
I know. I was there.

41:15.864 --> 41:18.345
We're definitely gonna need
more coffee. Yep.

41:18.388 --> 41:21.261
Ah... Kevin's parents are here.

41:21.304 --> 41:23.568
Oh, good. Let's have Donna...

41:23.611 --> 41:25.439
They didn't come in
the front door.

41:29.530 --> 41:32.490
- Dunn?
- Cathy? Randy?

41:32.533 --> 41:35.536
- Dunn!
- Cathy? Cathy and Randy Dunn,

41:35.580 --> 41:37.320
- find them.
- I'm on it.

41:37.364 --> 41:39.018
...by debris,
but emergency workers continue

41:39.061 --> 41:41.107
to sift through the wreckage.
We're still waiting...

41:41.150 --> 41:42.978
Never ends.

41:43.022 --> 41:44.545
That's another wave
of patients coming our way.

41:44.589 --> 41:46.591
- Yeah.
- What do we got here?

41:46.634 --> 41:49.332
- Dad?
- Yeah?

41:49.376 --> 41:51.160
...determine
how many total passengers

41:51.204 --> 41:53.554
and cars have been affected
by the accident.

41:53.598 --> 41:55.469
Paramedics are
currently on site.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.297
And we're being told
backup is being sent.

41:57.340 --> 41:59.386
That's Mom's car.
