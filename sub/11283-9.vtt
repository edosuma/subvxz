WEBVTT

00:02.269 --> 00:04.370
MAN (muffled):
Somebody help me!

00:04.372 --> 00:06.705
Help me! Help me!
(pounding)

00:06.707 --> 00:08.207
Don't!

00:08.209 --> 00:10.142
(muffled yelling)

00:10.144 --> 00:12.344
Help!
Okay, that's it.

00:15.583 --> 00:16.749
Help!

00:16.751 --> 00:18.517
You shut up!
No. Please.

00:18.519 --> 00:21.420
Please. You said
you'd let me go.

00:21.422 --> 00:22.755
No. We are not done yet.

00:22.757 --> 00:25.224
I know you've been
through a lot, and I'm sorry.

00:25.226 --> 00:27.226
Sorry for some bad decisions
that you've made?
Please. This...

00:27.228 --> 00:29.161
This isn't the way...
Or sorry that you don't
get to, what?

00:29.163 --> 00:31.330
Just walk away?

00:31.332 --> 00:33.399
I have... I have
two little girls.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.100
Please. And a wife.

00:35.102 --> 00:36.301
No!

00:36.303 --> 00:38.070
Somebody! Help!

00:38.072 --> 00:39.705
Stop!

00:39.707 --> 00:42.441
(quiet, muffled groaning)

00:53.654 --> 00:55.320
Mr. Finch?

00:55.322 --> 00:56.655
He's right
over there.

00:56.657 --> 00:59.091
Mr. Finch, how are you?

00:59.093 --> 01:00.492
I'm Lee. I'm the branch manager.

01:00.494 --> 01:04.196
Dennis tells me you want
to withdraw $40,000, correct?

01:04.198 --> 01:05.781
That's right.

01:05.782 --> 01:07.365
Well, unfortunately,
Mr. Finch, the daily

01:07.368 --> 01:10.369
cash withdrawal limit
on your account is only $10,000.

01:10.371 --> 01:11.637
$10,000?

01:11.639 --> 01:13.205
That's right.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.574
We could arrange
a cashier's check

01:15.576 --> 01:17.676
for the balance,
if that works for you.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.111
A check?

01:19.113 --> 01:20.813
Yeah?
No.

01:20.815 --> 01:22.815
That really doesn't work.

01:22.817 --> 01:24.850
You see, uh,

01:24.852 --> 01:28.187
I actually need the full amount
in cash, so...

01:28.189 --> 01:30.823
Well, we can certainly do that
at ten thousand a day.

01:30.825 --> 01:33.759
Look, the thing is,
I'm a little short on time.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.494
I'm sure you can
make an exception.

01:35.496 --> 01:37.196
It's a perfectly
simple transaction.

01:37.198 --> 01:40.199
Unfortunately, Mr. Finch, um,
we're a small credit union.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.801
A withdrawal of that size
requires 24 hours notice.

01:42.803 --> 01:45.704
So, as I said, if you'd like
to come back tomorrow...

01:45.706 --> 01:47.306
No, that's not an option!

01:47.308 --> 01:50.409
Mr. Finch, could I just ask you
to lower your voice?

01:50.411 --> 01:52.411
Look, this is
my own money.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.313
Okay, it belongs to me.

01:54.315 --> 01:55.481
This is perfectly
simple.
Okay.

01:55.483 --> 01:56.849
All you need to
do is return to me

01:56.851 --> 01:58.250
the money I left
in your care,

01:58.252 --> 01:59.418
and I'll be on my way.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.552
I'm afraid that's just
not possible.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.688
Make it possible!
(woman gasps)

02:06.560 --> 02:08.627
(clears throat)

02:17.505 --> 02:18.537
(Jules humming)

02:18.539 --> 02:19.705
You need a hand?

02:19.707 --> 02:20.873
No, I'm good.

02:20.875 --> 02:22.541
You need a hand
with the tie-off?

02:22.543 --> 02:24.776
No.
You know, if you'd give
it a quarter-twist...

02:24.778 --> 02:26.178
Okay, you know what, Jules?

02:26.180 --> 02:27.346
It's all yours.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.547
Thanks.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.516
Hey, how's Sophie?

02:30.518 --> 02:31.717
She's good.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.485
How's her big belly?

02:33.487 --> 02:34.753
Big.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.522
Did you got a
new ultrasound?

02:36.524 --> 02:38.157
No.
How'd you do
it with Clark?

02:38.159 --> 02:41.560
You know, making
the time, this job?

02:41.562 --> 02:43.462
You just...
You just do it, you know?

02:43.464 --> 02:44.930
You make the time.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.565
Okay.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.700
PARKER:
Not a good subject
right now.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.302
What's going on?

02:50.304 --> 02:51.904
Just give him
a little space.
Space.

02:51.906 --> 02:53.906
Sure.
WINNIE:
Team One, gear up.

02:53.908 --> 02:55.440
(alarm sounding)

02:55.442 --> 02:58.343
Armed robbery in progress.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.746
Single suspect, white male, 40s,
handgun.

03:00.748 --> 03:03.515
(sirens blaring)

03:03.517 --> 03:04.967
Hostages?

03:04.968 --> 03:06.418
At least half a dozen.
One witness made it out.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.003
She told a first responder

03:08.004 --> 03:09.587
that the man was screaming
at the tellers.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.490
Uh, thought he might be
emotionally disturbed.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.659
Kept saying "I want my money.
It's my money."

03:13.661 --> 03:15.627
Thanks, Winnie.

03:15.629 --> 03:16.795
You're quiet.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.197
I'm listening.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.498
White male, 40s.
I heard her.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.800
How's Sophie?

03:21.802 --> 03:23.502
She's good.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.604
She's staying
with her mom, still.

03:25.606 --> 03:26.972
Her mom couldn't come stay
with you, huh?

03:26.974 --> 03:28.974
You go up there yet?

03:28.976 --> 03:30.609
I call her.

03:30.611 --> 03:31.610
Hmm. How's that?

03:31.612 --> 03:32.778
She needs her space,

03:32.780 --> 03:36.381
so I'm-I'm giving it to her.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.483
What?

03:38.485 --> 03:40.552
I thought you were a fighter.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.390
So, Jules...

03:45.392 --> 03:46.592
Yeah.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.227
Asking about kids.

03:48.229 --> 03:51.363
Does nothing escape your notice?

03:53.467 --> 03:56.735
(sirens blaring)

03:59.807 --> 04:02.407
SAM:
That glass is a problem.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.508
He's gonna see us coming.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.244
Spike, what's on the roof?

04:05.246 --> 04:06.745
SPIKE:
If you get up there,
you may have access,

04:06.747 --> 04:09.314
but you might have
to pop open a roof hatch.

04:09.316 --> 04:11.917
I'll grab a wedge.
All right, let's check the back.
Let's get up there.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.386
Got a couple more witnesses.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.622
He's working alone,
he's emotionally volatile.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.724
He managed to disarm
the security guard,

04:18.726 --> 04:20.626
and, uh, he keeps
saying "It's my money."

04:20.628 --> 04:22.027
He came unarmed?
Yup.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.929
Well, this isn't sounding
like a stick-'em-up.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.298
Yeah, more like a really
unsatisfied customer,

04:26.300 --> 04:27.599
whose name
is Mr. Finch.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.134
Mr. Finch?

04:29.135 --> 04:30.668
Yeah, that's what the
staff kept calling him.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.671
Well, you could have
said that first, Jules. Spike?

04:32.673 --> 04:34.206
Got it. Mr. Finch.

04:34.207 --> 04:35.740
I'm accessing the credit union
records right now,

04:35.743 --> 04:37.643
and I got CCTV coming up, too.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.411
Now, how are you getting
that from the truck?

04:39.413 --> 04:40.612
'Cause I'm magic.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.680
'Cause he talked

04:41.682 --> 04:43.015
to the assistant
branch manager

04:43.017 --> 04:44.583
who gave him
the access code.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.351
And I worked my magic by

04:46.353 --> 04:48.053
asking her nicely.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.622
Here's our way up.

05:03.871 --> 05:06.471
Roger Finch is definitely
a customer at this branch.

05:06.473 --> 05:07.673
PARKER:
Any criminal records?

05:07.675 --> 05:09.074
Mental health records?

05:09.076 --> 05:10.876
No and no. Record's clean.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.679
Place of work--
Central District High School.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.347
He's a principal.

05:15.349 --> 05:16.515
What about family?

05:16.517 --> 05:18.617
Got a Gina Finch
from the same address

05:18.619 --> 05:19.985
who's also got an account here.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.587
Her place of work--
Carlbrook Business Center.

05:22.589 --> 05:23.722
Okay.
Carlbrook's is about
a block from here.

05:23.724 --> 05:24.890
All right, get the number,

05:24.892 --> 05:26.692
see if she can come down here.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.260
Then call the school.

05:28.261 --> 05:29.827
Maybe they can shed some light
on this.

05:33.067 --> 05:35.067
What do you see?

05:35.069 --> 05:36.668
Four angles.
Take your pick.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.103
Looks like about
12 hostages.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.504
What? No sound?

05:39.506 --> 05:40.605
It's a pretty
basic system.

05:40.607 --> 05:41.840
Video only.

05:41.842 --> 05:45.777
No injuries, though,
as far as I can tell.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.813
LEE:
Look, I'm-I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.114
What is the problem here?

05:49.116 --> 05:50.615
I'm sorry.
This is a bank.

05:50.617 --> 05:51.850
No, I... I'm sorry.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.720
I-I told you,
the vault locks down.

05:54.722 --> 05:55.787
Then take it out of here.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.089
(grunts)
Look, I-I...

05:57.091 --> 05:58.457
Open these right now!

05:58.459 --> 05:59.725
Okay, look, the drawers

05:59.727 --> 06:01.460
lock automatically.
The-The...

06:01.462 --> 06:03.395
The cash drops down
into a safe...

06:03.397 --> 06:04.696
Then open the safe!

06:04.698 --> 06:05.997
I...
(phone ringing)

06:07.134 --> 06:08.533
(murmuring)

06:08.535 --> 06:09.968
It's the police.

06:11.372 --> 06:12.904
PARKER:
Roger Finch?

06:12.906 --> 06:14.706
Yes.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.942
How you doing? This is
Sergeant Greg Parker. I'm with

06:16.944 --> 06:18.410
the Police
Strategic Response Unit.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.379
I need for you
to tell these people

06:20.381 --> 06:22.114
to let me take my own money out

06:22.116 --> 06:23.482
of my own account!

06:23.484 --> 06:24.649
Can you do
that for me?

06:24.651 --> 06:25.884
$40,000 in cash.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.019
You do that for me,
and this'll be over.

06:28.021 --> 06:30.021
Well, is there a reason
you need that amount today, sir?

06:30.023 --> 06:31.390
'Cause if someone's
pressuring you...

06:31.392 --> 06:32.557
No one's...

06:32.559 --> 06:33.759
Look, I haven't
got time for this.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.560
I need for you, as
a police officer,

06:35.562 --> 06:37.763
to order these people to
let me have my own money.

06:37.765 --> 06:38.730
Then I leave.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.499
Nobody gets hurt.

06:40.501 --> 06:43.002
Okay. I can speak to them.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.504
But I'm gonna ask you first
to put the gun on the floor

06:45.506 --> 06:47.139
while I get
a dialogue going, okay?

06:47.141 --> 06:49.674
No, I can't do that!

06:49.676 --> 06:50.842
Please, just-just-just...
just...

06:50.844 --> 06:52.444
ED:
<i> This guy hasn't exactly</i>

06:52.446 --> 06:54.846
thought this out.
PARKER:
Well, he wasn't expecting

06:54.848 --> 06:56.148
to need a gun today.

06:56.150 --> 06:57.582
SAM:
A civilian having

06:57.584 --> 06:58.750
a bad day.

06:58.752 --> 06:59.751
He's no career criminal.

06:59.753 --> 07:00.752
But I'm worried about

07:00.754 --> 07:02.821
that tunnel vision
right now.

07:02.823 --> 07:03.922
He mentioned being short
on time.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.090
PARKER:
He's stressed,

07:05.092 --> 07:06.658
and he's not listening,

07:06.660 --> 07:08.093
'cause his demands
aren't being met.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.828
He's erratic and impulsive.
We got to get in there now.

07:09.830 --> 07:10.996
SPIKE:
If you go to your left,

07:10.998 --> 07:12.731
you should find that hatch.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.838
All right,
we're in. Sam?

07:23.444 --> 07:26.478
Hey, boss, this is
Roger's wife, Gina.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.913
I don't understand
what's going on.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.448
Mrs. Finch,
I'm Sergeant Parker.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.082
Have you spoken
to your husband today?

07:31.084 --> 07:32.751
Yes, before he left for work.

07:32.753 --> 07:33.819
Any unusual behavior?

07:33.821 --> 07:35.254
No, he was fine.

07:35.255 --> 07:36.688
Please, what's
going on?
I'm sorry

07:36.690 --> 07:38.523
to say this, ma'am,
but your husband

07:38.525 --> 07:39.758
is in that building,

07:39.760 --> 07:40.926
and he's armed.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.093
What?

07:42.095 --> 07:43.628
He's trying
to get his hands

07:43.630 --> 07:45.731
on a large sum of money
from his account.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.833
Do you have any idea why
he would need to do this?
No, I don't.

07:47.835 --> 07:50.035
Do you know if he's
involved with gambling?

07:50.037 --> 07:52.637
Does he go to the casinos,
play the horses?
No. Definitely not.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.039
Look, I know
this is difficult,

07:54.041 --> 07:56.508
but has he had
to borrow any money lately?

07:56.510 --> 07:58.143
You have two kids, right?

07:58.145 --> 07:59.878
Yes, two girls.

07:59.880 --> 08:00.846
Paige and Natalie.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.047
And where are they now?

08:02.049 --> 08:03.782
I-I dropped them off
at school this morning.

08:03.784 --> 08:04.950
What school is that?

08:04.952 --> 08:06.568
Rivington Public.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.185
I'm going to send
a police officer there now,

08:08.188 --> 08:09.821
just check on them?
Is that okay?

08:09.823 --> 08:11.656
Spike, you copy that?

08:11.658 --> 08:13.558
SPIKE:
Copy, boss.
Okay, I'm sorry,

08:13.560 --> 08:15.627
Mrs. Finch, but we just need
to understand

08:15.629 --> 08:17.229
why your husband's gone
to such extremes

08:17.231 --> 08:19.097
to get his hands
on that kind of money.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.732
No. This has to be a mistake.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.200
Okay, I understand.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.568
Do you mind
just stepping

08:23.570 --> 08:24.736
inside the truck
for a moment?

08:24.738 --> 08:25.937
I'll join you
in a second.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.272
Please don't let
anything happen to him.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.274
We don't plan on it, ma'am.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.977
There you go.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.812
ED:
Boss,

08:33.814 --> 08:36.114
seconds away.
PARKER:
Copy, Ed.

08:36.116 --> 08:39.718
Is it wise or not wise to bring
his wife into the picture?

08:39.720 --> 08:42.687
Well, if he's hiding something,
it could cause a confrontation.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.289
Could escalate
him even more.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.057
JULES:
Or it could make
him think twice

08:46.059 --> 08:48.793
about the consequences
of what he's doing.

08:48.795 --> 08:50.862
Let's give it a shot.

08:52.799 --> 08:54.900
Spike, any news
on, um, Mrs. Finch's girls?

08:54.902 --> 08:56.835
They're fine.
They're at school.

08:56.837 --> 08:57.769
That's great.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.221
Mrs. Finch, I can't

08:59.222 --> 09:00.672
put you on the phone,
but I'm going to talk

09:00.674 --> 09:02.491
to your husband in there,

09:02.492 --> 09:04.309
but I'm gonna need your help
just to keep him steady, okay?

09:04.311 --> 09:05.310
Sure.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.045
Thank you.

09:10.817 --> 09:12.751
(phone ringing)

09:12.753 --> 09:13.885
(panting)

09:16.156 --> 09:17.622
What?

09:17.624 --> 09:18.823
PARKER:
Mr. Finch,

09:18.825 --> 09:19.991
Greg Parker again.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.159
I'm here with your wife.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.794
My w... my wife?

09:22.796 --> 09:25.630
No. No, no, no,
I don't want to talk to her.

09:25.632 --> 09:26.932
She's really worried
about you, sir,

09:26.934 --> 09:28.867
and she just wants
to help figure out...

09:28.869 --> 09:30.702
I've got nothing to say to her!
PARKER:
That's fine,

09:30.704 --> 09:31.970
Roger. I'm going
to do the talking,

09:31.972 --> 09:33.204
but I'd like
to be able to explain

09:33.206 --> 09:35.206
to Gina here
what this is all about.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.641
We're done!
(click)

09:36.643 --> 09:39.010
All right, stand by
for aggressive entry.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.712
That's not him.

09:40.714 --> 09:41.846
That's-That's
not my husband.

09:41.848 --> 09:43.014
Pardon me?

09:43.016 --> 09:44.783
That's not him.
It doesn't even

09:44.785 --> 09:45.850
look like him.
Jules.

09:45.852 --> 09:47.018
I'm on it.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.587
PARKER:
Team One, new deal.

09:48.589 --> 09:51.690
We have no I.D. on the subject,
Officers.

09:52.893 --> 09:55.060
Boss,

09:55.062 --> 09:57.028
if it's not him, who is it?

09:57.030 --> 10:01.099
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

10:30.364 --> 10:31.796
(sirens chirping)

10:31.798 --> 10:33.732
(garbled radio transmission)

10:35.102 --> 10:36.868
Finch never showed up
at school.

10:36.870 --> 10:39.304
The car's in the parking lot,
door left wide open.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.905
We're looking at
an abduction.

10:40.907 --> 10:42.340
And stolen identity.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.843
I got advantage,
boss. I can take him.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.862
Eddie, we need
to take this guy less-lethal.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.880
He's the only one who knows
where the real Roger Finch is.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.415
Boss, we don't less-lethal
a finger on the trigger.

10:50.417 --> 10:51.716
Then we lose his victim.

10:51.718 --> 10:53.885
(yelling)

10:53.887 --> 10:55.954
(explosive pops,
woman yells)

10:55.956 --> 10:59.758
I swear, this is
your last chance.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.926
Don't. Don't.
Please?
You want me to
shoot, I'll shoot.

11:01.928 --> 11:03.161
There's nothing I can do.

11:03.163 --> 11:03.928
GUNMAN:
I'm not joking!

11:03.930 --> 11:04.963
We've lost visual.

11:04.965 --> 11:05.964
GUNMAN:
You hear me?

11:05.966 --> 11:07.032
Boss, we're going in.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.000
(firing, people screaming)

11:09.002 --> 11:11.236
I don't think you're
listening to me.

11:11.238 --> 11:13.204
Let's go. Go, go.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.339
(clatters)

11:14.341 --> 11:17.108
(banging)

11:17.110 --> 11:19.010
Police! Right there!
Drop the gun!
Drop your weapon!

11:19.012 --> 11:20.078
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!

11:20.080 --> 11:22.047
SRU! Drop your weapon!
Drop it now!

11:22.049 --> 11:23.181
(firing)

11:23.183 --> 11:24.716
(man screams)
Down, down!

11:24.718 --> 11:26.785
Stay down! Stay down!
It's over!

11:26.787 --> 11:29.754
(panicked clamoring)

11:30.457 --> 11:32.023
Got him, Sam?
(handcuffs clicking)

11:32.025 --> 11:33.958
Yes, sir.
Boss, subject's secure.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.361
Copy that, Eddie.
Spike, you stand by.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.230
Let's I.D. this guy and find out
where the real Roger Finch is.

11:39.232 --> 11:40.432
Got it.

11:40.434 --> 11:43.034
Roger Finch's wallet.
And that?

11:43.036 --> 11:44.703
That's Roger Finch's checkbook.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.838
All right.
Let's get him up.

11:46.840 --> 11:50.475
Garth Scarrow's wallet.

11:50.477 --> 11:51.943
(phone chirps)

11:51.945 --> 11:54.212
Spike, we've got a positive
I.D. of our gunman.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.814
Scarrow. Got it.

11:55.816 --> 11:56.981
ED (over comm):
Where is he, Garth?

11:56.983 --> 11:58.183
Garth, where's Roger Finch?

11:58.185 --> 11:59.784
I don't know.

11:59.786 --> 12:02.020
He was abducted from his car
earlier today.

12:02.022 --> 12:03.888
Okay.
Okay? And here you are

12:03.890 --> 12:05.290
with his what?
His wallet and his checkbook?

12:05.292 --> 12:06.608
That's right.

12:06.609 --> 12:07.925
Has he been harmed
in any way, Garth?

12:07.928 --> 12:09.378
I don't know.

12:09.379 --> 12:10.829
I found that on the
ground near a car.

12:10.831 --> 12:11.996
I figured it was
my lucky day.

12:11.998 --> 12:14.165
Get him out of here.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.301
Spike, Scarrow's
a plumbing contractor.

12:16.303 --> 12:17.502
SPIKE:
Copy.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.037
No criminal record.
No meds or mentals.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.472
It must be his first hold-up.

12:20.474 --> 12:22.373
Cross-reference Scarrow's name
with Roger Finch's?

12:22.375 --> 12:23.742
You got it.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.910
The gunman is
a plumber.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.946
Have you had any work done
on your house recently?

12:27.948 --> 12:29.114
No, he didn't...
I told you.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.749
I've never seen him before
in my life.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.052
Gina!

12:36.456 --> 12:37.989
JULES:
Gina, hold on!

12:37.991 --> 12:39.357
What have you done with him?
Where is Roger?

12:39.359 --> 12:40.525
PARKER:
Wordy, hold up.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.761
Please! Just tell me.
Is he alive?

12:42.763 --> 12:43.928
Is he alive?

12:43.930 --> 12:46.364
Yeah. He's alive.
He's alive. He's safe.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.766
Okay?

12:47.768 --> 12:49.033
That's all
I can tell you.

12:49.035 --> 12:51.269
Who's Mark Logan?

12:51.271 --> 12:53.238
Huh?
(phone beeps)

12:53.239 --> 12:55.206
You texted him two minutes
before we arrested you.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.208
"I'm sorry. Road block."

12:57.210 --> 12:59.444
Who's that?

12:59.446 --> 13:00.912
Let's try this again.

13:00.914 --> 13:03.314
Who's Mark, and what
are you sorry for?

13:03.316 --> 13:06.985
I'm sorry I failed,
but I'm not sorry I tried.

13:06.987 --> 13:09.020
SPIKE:
Boss?

13:09.022 --> 13:11.523
Yeah. Spike, go ahead.

13:11.525 --> 13:13.308
Mark Logan connects
me some dots.

13:13.309 --> 13:15.092
Garth Scarrow's daughter Ava
is married to a Mark Logan.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.394
Got an address?

13:16.396 --> 13:17.462
Coming up.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.898
Keep him here.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.434
Let's get to the Logans'
house ASAP, Eddie.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.069
They're all involved.

13:25.071 --> 13:27.038
They're either holding him
or they know where he is.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.907
But they don't know
that we know that,

13:28.909 --> 13:31.109
so let's not turn it
into a hostage situation.

13:31.111 --> 13:31.976
Stealth and speed, boss.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.878
All right.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.088
No vehicles out back.

13:44.090 --> 13:46.357
No possible rear exit, either.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.126
Copy.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.840
No movement.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.308
Police!

14:03.310 --> 14:04.843
Open the door!

14:06.346 --> 14:08.112
Police! Open up!

14:09.983 --> 14:12.250
Police! SRU!
Police! SRU!

14:12.252 --> 14:13.885
Police! SRU!

14:13.887 --> 14:16.521
SRU! Police!

14:20.594 --> 14:23.061
Bathroom clear!

14:23.063 --> 14:24.162
Basement clear.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.464
Bedroom clear.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.299
Upstairs clear.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.869
Boss, the Logan house
is empty.

14:30.871 --> 14:33.037
ED:
There's no sign of Roger Finch.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.340
I got cars registered to
both Mark and Ava Logan.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.041
Putting out a city-wide
APB on both vehicles.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.310
Ed, get a read
on the house.
ED: Copy that.

14:43.016 --> 14:45.149
Ava Logan. Employment
history ends two years ago.

14:45.151 --> 14:46.517
Never completed high school.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.119
Mark Logan,

14:48.121 --> 14:50.121
current employment:
warehouse custodian

14:50.123 --> 14:51.656
at Polson Industrial Park.

14:51.658 --> 14:54.025
And aside from two
parking tickets,

14:54.027 --> 14:56.094
they're both squeaky clean.

15:05.372 --> 15:08.106
Mark, what's going on?

15:08.108 --> 15:09.474
Your dad texted me.
He didn't make it.

15:09.476 --> 15:12.076
Oh, God. Is he... is he okay?
I mean, what happened?

15:12.078 --> 15:13.311
I don't know, I don't know.
We're going to have

15:13.313 --> 15:15.013
to start thinking
ahead, just in case.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.281
CHILD:
Dad?

15:21.154 --> 15:22.921
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

15:22.923 --> 15:25.556
Where's Poppy? Mom said he was
going to be with you.

15:25.558 --> 15:28.426
Yeah, um, Poppy
had some things to do.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.561
But he's gonna
meet us later, okay?

15:30.563 --> 15:32.497
He wanted me
to tell you to be brave.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.198
I'm brave.
(chuckles)

15:35.502 --> 15:37.201
We're due at 3:00.

15:37.203 --> 15:38.136
You ready for this, bud?

15:38.138 --> 15:39.404
Bring it on.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.239
That's my kid.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.073
(man screaming)
(pounding)

15:42.075 --> 15:43.641
Mark.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.677
I'll see you later.

15:45.679 --> 15:47.178
Okay? Bye.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.449
Look, you got to go.
I know.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.951
They're expecting him.
We need to get ready.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.519
Yeah. But how, Mark? We
don't have the money.

15:54.521 --> 15:55.954
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
I'll get it.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.121
How? How are we...

15:57.123 --> 15:58.289
(man screaming)
(pounding)

15:58.291 --> 15:59.490
Oh, God.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.192
I'll figure
something out, okay?

16:01.194 --> 16:02.460
Come on. Go, go.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.731
(shouting continues)
Okay, Chris.
Buckle up.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.232
(engine starts)

16:14.074 --> 16:16.007
MAN:
Help!

16:16.009 --> 16:17.108
(pounding inside trunk)

16:17.110 --> 16:20.144
Somebody! Help!

16:20.146 --> 16:23.281
WORDY:
<i> Got some final notices here.</i>

16:23.283 --> 16:25.283
Looks like their credit cards
are maxed out.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.385
So, what? They talk her dad
into hitting a bank?

16:27.387 --> 16:28.753
SAM:
We might have something.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.521
They have a son, Chris,
who's obviously really sick.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.423
There's an I.V.
and lots of medication.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.459
Prednisone,
methotrexates.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.494
Where are those
prescriptions from?

16:36.496 --> 16:40.264
JULES:
Uh, a pharmacy at St. Simon's.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.700
I'd say this kid's got leukemia.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.235
They've got all
these books on it,

16:44.237 --> 16:46.604
and some of them
are pretty advanced.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.773
St. Simon's has got
a really good cancer ward.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.174
You know, if they're treating
his leukemia there,

16:50.176 --> 16:51.609
I bet they know the parents
pretty well.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.244
PARKER: Okay, Jules.
That's a good place to start.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.712
Copy. On my way.

16:54.714 --> 16:57.248
Sam, pick up a phone and do
a star-98 to retrieve messages.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.350
Try 1234 as a password.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.253
(dialing)

17:02.255 --> 17:03.554
No.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.023
Try the house address.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.124
4427.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.158
No.

17:07.160 --> 17:10.461
Spike, let me try his birthday.

17:10.463 --> 17:13.498
Logan, Chris.
Ten-27.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.700
(dialing)

17:15.702 --> 17:18.236
Hey, we got it.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.638
Three messages.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.507
DIGITAL VOICE:
To listen, press one.

17:22.508 --> 17:24.375
WOMAN (on recording):
Hello, this is the Dovercourt
Public Library calling.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.077
DIGITAL VOICE:
Next.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.545
SCARROW (on recording):
Mark, damn it. Where are you?

17:27.547 --> 17:30.114
Never mind. I'll text your cell.

17:30.116 --> 17:31.416
DIGITAL VOICE:
Next.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.117
MAN:
Mark, Terrence Brown again.

17:33.119 --> 17:36.287
Look, I'm really sorry, but the
price remains the same in cash.

17:36.289 --> 17:37.488
No negotiations.

17:37.490 --> 17:40.124
Plus hotel and expenses
during my recovery.

17:40.126 --> 17:41.526
I'm up against the wall
Recovery?

17:41.528 --> 17:43.261
myself right now, okay?
Surgery.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.396
Bills of my own, and we did
have an understanding.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.799
So we'll see you at 2:00
on Friday as planned,

17:47.801 --> 17:49.233
unless I hear otherwise, okay?

17:49.235 --> 17:50.835
Thanks. Bye.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.304
Okay, the only real cure
for leukemia

17:53.306 --> 17:54.238
is bone marrow transplant,

17:54.240 --> 17:56.240
but it's hard to find a match.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.376
Yeah, well, it looks
like the Logans found one.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.245
He was going
to charge them 40 grand.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.113
Well, desperate parents,
someone takes advantage.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.815
He mentioned a hotel.

18:03.817 --> 18:07.385
There's a charge for a room at
the Traveler's Oasis on King.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.320
Winnie.
Yeah, Sarge?

18:09.322 --> 18:11.656
Winnie, send a couple of
unmarked units to sit on the

18:11.658 --> 18:14.425
Traveler's Oasis on King with
photos of Mark and Ava Logan.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.793
All right?

18:15.795 --> 18:18.329
And have them alert us
immediately if they're spotted.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.298
WINNIE: Copy that.
We're not going to pick up

18:20.300 --> 18:21.549
the guy who's trafficking
body parts?

18:21.550 --> 18:22.799
PARKER: Hey. Right now
all the Logans know

18:22.802 --> 18:24.435
is that the bank robbery
went south.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.270
As long as they think they can
still get what they want,

18:26.272 --> 18:28.673
we can try
to predict their moves.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.274
Shut up!
Somebody help me!

18:30.276 --> 18:31.876
Help me!

18:31.878 --> 18:33.411
(sirens wailing)

18:33.413 --> 18:34.445
Help me!
Shut up!

18:34.447 --> 18:37.415
Shut up!
Help!

18:37.417 --> 18:38.883
(pounding inside trunk)

18:40.653 --> 18:42.453
Help!
Okay, that's it.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.527
Help me!

18:49.529 --> 18:50.528
Help!

18:50.530 --> 18:52.330
You shut up!
No, no, no. No.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.599
Shut up!
Please.

18:54.601 --> 18:57.268
Please.
You said you'd let me go.

18:57.270 --> 18:58.536
No. I said I'd let you go when
we were done,

18:58.538 --> 19:00.271
and we are not done yet.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.406
Look, look, I know
you've been through a lot.

19:02.408 --> 19:03.441
And I'm sorry.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.243
Oh, you're sorry?
Sorry for what?

19:05.245 --> 19:06.577
Sorry...
sorry for what you've...

19:06.579 --> 19:08.446
Sorry for some bad decisions
that you've made?

19:08.448 --> 19:10.615
No, I... Look...
Or sorry that you
don't get to what?

19:10.617 --> 19:11.816
Just walk away?

19:11.818 --> 19:12.850
Please. This-This isn't the way.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.285
You don't get
to say sorry

19:14.287 --> 19:15.653
unless you're willing
to make this right.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.424
There's nothing I can do.

19:20.426 --> 19:23.594
There's nothing I can
do. There's nothing.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.296
I have...
I have two little girls.

19:25.298 --> 19:27.265
Please. And a wife.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.467
Please. I have to think of them.

19:29.469 --> 19:32.670
Yeah. Yeah,
you do have a wife and kids.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.739
Help! Somebody!

19:34.741 --> 19:36.340
No!

19:36.342 --> 19:37.742
Somebody! Help!

19:38.645 --> 19:40.211
(grunts)

19:50.757 --> 19:52.957
Gina, do you know
a young married couple

19:52.959 --> 19:54.926
named Ava and Mark Logan?

19:54.928 --> 19:57.328
No. I don't think so.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.429
They have a young boy
named Chris

19:58.431 --> 20:00.765
who's sick
with leukemia.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.400
No. The name isn't familiar.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.501
(cell phone ringing)
Oh.

20:03.503 --> 20:04.835
Excuse me.
Sure.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.704
(phone beeps on)

20:06.706 --> 20:08.339
Hello?

20:08.341 --> 20:09.807
Yes.

20:09.809 --> 20:11.242
Who is this?

20:11.244 --> 20:13.844
It's-It's him.
Okay.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.947
It's okay. I want you
to put it on speakerphone

20:15.949 --> 20:17.348
and keep talking to him.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.450
Calmly, okay?

20:19.452 --> 20:20.918
(phone beeps)

20:22.689 --> 20:25.756
Please,
just-just tell me what you want.

20:25.758 --> 20:28.259
MARK:
$40,000 in cash,

20:28.261 --> 20:29.360
or your husband dies.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.429
You have 30 minutes.

20:36.302 --> 20:37.501
$40,000?

20:37.503 --> 20:38.769
PARKER:
Yes. The same amount

20:38.771 --> 20:40.738
that Garth Scarrow
was trying to withdraw.

20:40.740 --> 20:41.906
The price of the blood
for Chris.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.541
Mark Logan's just turned this

20:43.543 --> 20:44.942
into kidnapping for ransom.

20:44.944 --> 20:47.311
Finch's life in exchange
for his son's.

20:47.313 --> 20:48.946
Why would he still be
trying to get the money?

20:48.948 --> 20:50.181
'Cause he doesn't
know we're on to him

20:50.182 --> 20:51.415
or that we're
staking out the donor.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.750
He's got a deadline, guys.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.018
He still thinks
he can pull this off.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.653
What, with a botched bank heist

20:55.655 --> 20:57.488
and a kidnapping?
WORDY:
He's out of time.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.557
He's grasping at straws.
My girls were in trouble,

20:59.559 --> 21:00.791
I'd be grasping, too.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.693
All right.
So let's pay this guy.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.562
Yeah. Money job's the
best way to lure him out.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.664
We let him think that he's going
to get everything he wants.

21:06.666 --> 21:07.965
Copy that.
Already called downtown.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.667
The money's on its way
to us now.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.302
Nice.
Well done, boss.

21:11.304 --> 21:13.771
Grab him at the pick-up and
we'll make him take us to Finch.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.673
Yes, and he wants us
to put the cash

21:15.675 --> 21:18.709
inside a garbage can on the
corner of Dundas and Jarvis.

21:18.711 --> 21:19.944
All right.
Let's get on it.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.746
We recon the area
and get into position.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.583
Spike, let's use traffic cameras

21:25.585 --> 21:27.318
to keep an eye out
for Mark's car.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.986
Traffic cameras?
Yeah.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.288
Okay.

21:30.290 --> 21:32.390
(typing)

21:38.031 --> 21:39.831
Excuse me.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.632
I'm looking for a pediatric
patient-- Chris Logan.

21:41.634 --> 21:42.833
Chris. Sure.
He's here now.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.035
Where?

21:44.037 --> 21:46.070
He's in Pre-op,
just down the hall.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.339
(indistinct P.A. announcement)

21:51.911 --> 21:54.078
MAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Harris to X-ray.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.013
Dr. Harris to X-ray.

21:56.015 --> 21:57.615
Whoa!

21:57.617 --> 21:59.050
Are you Chris?

21:59.052 --> 22:00.851
Yeah. Who are you?

22:00.853 --> 22:02.453
I'm Jules. I'm looking
for your parents.

22:02.455 --> 22:05.323
Are they here?
What kind of
uniform is that?

22:05.325 --> 22:06.757
Strategic Response Unit.

22:06.759 --> 22:09.093
Are your parents...?
That's like SWAT, right?

22:09.095 --> 22:12.330
Pretty much.
Except what?

22:12.332 --> 22:14.565
Well, except, uh,

22:14.567 --> 22:17.001
besides the normal SWAT stuff,

22:17.003 --> 22:21.105
we also specialize in,
uh, psychological profiling.

22:21.107 --> 22:23.507
Cool. You want to
try profiling me?
(laughs)

22:23.509 --> 22:26.477
Maybe later.
Have you ever
seen a dead body?

22:26.479 --> 22:28.546
Yeah, I have.

22:28.548 --> 22:31.449
When you find a dead body,
you have to tag and bag, right?

22:31.451 --> 22:33.584
(laughs) You certainly
know a lot about cops.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.119
I want to be a cop.

22:35.121 --> 22:36.454
You do?

22:36.456 --> 22:37.788
Or... a doctor.

22:37.790 --> 22:41.492
If I get to live, I want
to be a cop or a doctor.

22:43.096 --> 22:44.962
WOMAN:
Chris, they didn't have
the one you wanted,

22:44.964 --> 22:46.497
but Lily said that...

22:46.499 --> 22:47.631
Ava Logan?

22:47.633 --> 22:48.699
Uh, yes.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.134
I'm Jules Callaghan.

22:50.136 --> 22:52.470
Can I have a... a moment
with you out in the hallway?

22:52.472 --> 22:53.871
Sure.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.006
I'll be right outside, okay?

22:59.545 --> 23:01.545
JULES:
Your father was
just arrested

23:01.547 --> 23:03.781
for identity theft
and armed robbery.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.516
Armed? Oh, my God, is he okay?

23:05.518 --> 23:06.550
He's fine.

23:06.552 --> 23:07.985
He's in custody.
But right now,

23:07.987 --> 23:10.087
we need to find
your husband and Roger Finch.

23:10.089 --> 23:13.124
Uh, I don't...
I don't know where they are.

23:13.126 --> 23:14.959
Have you seen Mark today?

23:14.961 --> 23:16.994
I... I...

23:18.931 --> 23:21.432
Um...
Ava, your husband

23:21.434 --> 23:22.633
just threatened
to kill Roger Finch

23:22.635 --> 23:24.769
if his wife doesn't
come up with $40,000

23:24.771 --> 23:26.971
within the next
15 minutes.

23:26.973 --> 23:29.073
(gasps)
I don't believe it.

23:29.075 --> 23:30.641
It's not gonna work, Ava.

23:30.643 --> 23:33.411
We know about the money,
we know about the donor.

23:34.547 --> 23:36.080
(exhales)

23:36.082 --> 23:38.682
(sobbing)

23:38.684 --> 23:41.018
If you have any idea
where your husband is,

23:41.020 --> 23:43.120
please tell us before
somebody gets hurt.

23:43.122 --> 23:45.122
I'm sorry, I don't
know where he is.

23:45.124 --> 23:49.093
He just... he just said that
he would come up with something.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.461
(sighs)

23:54.767 --> 23:57.201
(sniffles)

24:00.506 --> 24:02.840
I don't like it--
it's too exposed,

24:02.842 --> 24:04.675
too many civilians, Wordy.

24:04.677 --> 24:07.511
Clear the area, he'll
know something's up.

24:07.513 --> 24:08.846
Okay. Sam?

24:08.848 --> 24:12.917
Heading to the roof
on the northwest corner.

24:12.919 --> 24:14.051
How's it coming, Eddie?

24:14.053 --> 24:16.153
Another few minutes,
we'll be in place.

24:16.155 --> 24:17.888
Okay, we've got less

24:17.890 --> 24:20.124
than ten minutes from pickup
if he's punctual. Spike?

24:20.126 --> 24:23.527
"Hey, Spike, why don't
you link up to all
the traffic cameras,

24:23.529 --> 24:25.146
"just patch into them?

24:25.147 --> 24:26.764
Do that hooky-hacky-patchy
thing you do."

24:26.766 --> 24:29.500
Spike... everything okay?

24:29.502 --> 24:31.202
I'm just saying,
that's a lot of cameras,

24:31.204 --> 24:33.637
that's a lot of cars.

24:33.639 --> 24:35.105
I'm trying.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.509
Jules, any news?

24:38.511 --> 24:39.743
Listen in.

24:39.745 --> 24:41.545
We know that it's illegal
to pay the donor,

24:41.547 --> 24:43.147
but Chris, he's been
on a wait list

24:43.149 --> 24:44.548
for a transplant
for over a year,

24:44.550 --> 24:46.183
and his organs, they're
starting to fail,

24:46.185 --> 24:49.186
and we... I mean, we
could lose him today.

24:49.188 --> 24:50.654
(crying):
Today.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.089
How'd you find Brown?

24:52.091 --> 24:54.158
We, uh, we put out
a public plea,

24:54.160 --> 24:56.560
a message board
and a Web site--

24:56.562 --> 24:58.562
anything to find
a match fast.

24:58.564 --> 25:01.198
And then we
found one.
But he wanted money?

25:01.200 --> 25:04.068
Which he only told us
after he got our hopes up.

25:04.070 --> 25:07.838
Because by then we'd...
we'd already started believing,

25:07.840 --> 25:10.541
you know,
that Chris had a chance.

25:10.543 --> 25:13.844
So... so we begged him,
but he wouldn't give his consent

25:13.846 --> 25:16.213
without seeing all
of the cash up front.

25:16.215 --> 25:21.085
So we agreed, and it's
supposed to happen today.

25:21.087 --> 25:24.154
Aw, Ava, you couldn't
have found another way?

25:24.156 --> 25:27.658
We... we tried to re-mortage,
but we're already in debt.

25:27.660 --> 25:30.227
Mark had to drop out of
med school when Chris got sick.

25:30.229 --> 25:31.295
My father has no money.

25:31.297 --> 25:33.531
Chris, Chris,
he doesn't have time

25:33.533 --> 25:36.033
for us to find another way.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.202
Why did you target
Roger Finch?

25:38.204 --> 25:40.938
Look, we're-we're not thieves.

25:40.940 --> 25:44.141
So this isn't random.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.280
(sighs)

25:59.325 --> 26:02.259
I knew him
from high school.

26:02.261 --> 26:04.261
He was your teacher?

26:04.263 --> 26:05.596
He was...

26:05.598 --> 26:08.299
he was a different
person back then, and...

26:08.301 --> 26:11.001
I didn't know any better.

26:11.003 --> 26:13.237
How long were you
involved with him?

26:13.239 --> 26:15.940
Mm-mm, it wasn't...
it wasn't like it sounds.

26:15.942 --> 26:17.875
It was nothing like it sounds.

26:17.877 --> 26:21.211
He was a teacher,
but he was young and...

26:21.213 --> 26:23.247
and one of those guys with...

26:23.249 --> 26:25.583
with a real gift, you know?

26:25.585 --> 26:28.852
That you can talk
about almost anything

26:28.854 --> 26:32.590
and shows you beauty
that you never saw before.

26:32.592 --> 26:35.793
And you just... you
don't want the class to end.

26:35.795 --> 26:38.329
But you dropped out.

26:38.331 --> 26:42.099
We made a mistake one night.

26:43.202 --> 26:45.636
It was one night.

26:45.638 --> 26:46.971
But I don't regret

26:46.973 --> 26:48.739
this boy.

26:49.842 --> 26:52.242
(crying):
He's my Chris.

26:53.813 --> 26:57.047
Did Roger know
he had a son?

26:57.049 --> 26:58.649
(sniffles)

26:58.651 --> 27:00.317
Not until recently. Uh...

27:00.319 --> 27:03.954
When we couldn't find
a donor match in the family,

27:03.956 --> 27:07.925
Mark and I, we broke down
and we went to see Roger.

27:07.927 --> 27:10.160
(door opens)
Sorry to keep
you folks waiting.

27:10.162 --> 27:12.162
Hi. Roger Finch.
Mark Logan.

27:12.164 --> 27:13.998
Mark, nice to meet you.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.300
(Ava clears throat)

27:16.302 --> 27:18.369
Hi, Roger.

27:19.872 --> 27:21.038
Ava.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.040
<i> We hadn't seen each other</i>

27:23.042 --> 27:24.942
in 11 years.

27:24.944 --> 27:27.778
We dropped the bomb on him
he had a son,

27:27.780 --> 27:29.813
his son would die soon
without the transplant,

27:29.815 --> 27:32.383
and that he was
the only one in the family

27:32.385 --> 27:36.654
that hadn't been tested...
that could save him.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.327
I'm not his family.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.295
Roger, I'm sorry that
I didn't tell you.

27:45.297 --> 27:48.298
I thought that
it was for the best.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.367
And what makes you
think it's me?

27:50.369 --> 27:53.003
What?
I mean, you were a
popular girl.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.840
How can you think that I...?
I would never...

27:56.842 --> 27:58.008
Maybe you were hoping

27:58.010 --> 28:00.177
for something with me, hm?

28:00.179 --> 28:01.779
Hoping?

28:02.748 --> 28:05.449
I'm afraid I can't help you.

28:05.451 --> 28:08.419
Look, Roger, we're not looking
for child support or anything.

28:08.421 --> 28:10.387
We're just trying to save Chris.

28:10.389 --> 28:12.923
I'm sorry. There must
be some other option.

28:12.925 --> 28:14.725
We are out of options,

28:14.727 --> 28:15.893
and that's why we're here.

28:15.895 --> 28:17.695
We're not trying
to ruin your life,

28:17.697 --> 28:19.363
we're just asking you
to get your blood tested.

28:19.365 --> 28:21.331
Yeah, I'm-I'm sorry, I, uh...

28:21.333 --> 28:24.768
I really hope you find
a donor for your son.

28:26.439 --> 28:28.706
That's all you're gonna say?

28:28.708 --> 28:30.074
That's all you have to say

28:30.076 --> 28:32.376
about this?
Please don't...
don't make me

28:32.378 --> 28:33.877
call security, please.

28:33.879 --> 28:35.212
Mark.

28:36.716 --> 28:38.816
Mark, come on.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.317
(scoffs)

28:41.387 --> 28:44.455
Why didn't you file
for a paternity test?

28:44.457 --> 28:46.156
Because they take... they take
time and money--

28:46.158 --> 28:47.991
it's two things
that we don't have.

28:47.993 --> 28:50.894
And we tried to get Roger
to help us with the money,

28:50.896 --> 28:53.397
but... he wouldn't even
return our phone calls.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.933
I'm sorry to ask you this,
but how old were you

28:55.935 --> 28:57.167
when you were with Roger?

28:58.137 --> 28:59.503
(sniffles)

28:59.505 --> 29:01.171
Too young.

29:01.173 --> 29:03.040
Legally speaking.

29:04.143 --> 29:05.743
Thank you.

29:05.745 --> 29:07.311
Okay, why don't you...

29:07.313 --> 29:09.313
stay with Chris.

29:09.315 --> 29:10.848
I... I...

29:11.517 --> 29:13.751
(sighs)

29:15.387 --> 29:16.487
Boss.

29:16.489 --> 29:18.455
Yeah, I got all that.

29:18.457 --> 29:20.424
He gives a blood test
and he's identified

29:20.426 --> 29:21.859
as the boy's biological father.

29:21.861 --> 29:23.360
And there's no
statue of limitations

29:23.362 --> 29:25.329
on statutory rape--
he'd be going to jail.

29:25.331 --> 29:27.531
Roger Finch, family man,
community leader,

29:27.533 --> 29:29.066
Teacher of the Year.

29:29.068 --> 29:31.235
Rape charge,
and his life is over.

29:31.237 --> 29:36.073
How can a guy just
let his own son die?

29:36.075 --> 29:39.009
(exhales)

29:39.010 --> 29:41.944
I don't know, boss, remind me
again who's the bad guy here.

29:43.048 --> 29:45.048
(sighs)

29:55.427 --> 29:57.227
In position.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.068
ED:
Okay, Wordy...

30:05.070 --> 30:06.403
(over radio):
make the drop.

30:06.405 --> 30:09.339
On my way.

30:14.847 --> 30:16.914
Package delivered.

30:21.821 --> 30:22.953
(typing)

30:22.955 --> 30:24.321
(beep)
No way.

30:24.323 --> 30:27.958
I got a '98 sedan,
plates match Mark Logan's.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.459
How far out?
12 blocks.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.466
Wordy, if we can take Logan down

30:36.468 --> 30:38.068
without endangering Finch,
let's do that.

30:38.070 --> 30:40.304
But if we can't,
let him take the money,

30:40.306 --> 30:41.605
we'll follow from
a safe distance.

30:41.607 --> 30:43.574
Copy that, boss.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.077
Standing by.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.183
Subject is seven
blocks away.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.352
Should be in position
in the next three minutes.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.588
Mom?

30:57.590 --> 31:00.524
I don't feel good--
I got to go to the washroom.

31:00.526 --> 31:01.625
Okay. It's okay.

31:01.627 --> 31:04.094
Come on. I gotcha.

31:04.096 --> 31:05.562
I gotcha.

31:05.564 --> 31:07.164
Is there anything
I can do?

31:07.166 --> 31:09.066
No. I got it.
Okay.

31:09.068 --> 31:11.435
Okay, here we go.

31:16.976 --> 31:18.609
(exhales)

31:20.179 --> 31:21.545
Stand by.

31:23.015 --> 31:24.214
Standing by.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.649
SPIKE:
Subject is entering
the drop zone.

31:25.651 --> 31:28.051
Standing by.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.222
Wait. What's he doing?

31:36.095 --> 31:38.028
He just did a U-turn.
Where's he going?

31:38.030 --> 31:40.631
Where'd he go, Spike?
I don't know, he must've
gone into an alley.

31:40.633 --> 31:43.033
(groans)

31:43.034 --> 31:45.434
Ava? Ava, I'm gonna
have to open this door.

31:47.673 --> 31:49.940
Okay, I need the phone.

31:51.543 --> 31:53.727
(sighs)
Boss...

31:53.728 --> 31:55.912
Ava texted Mark
and told him we were waiting.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.617
He's gone.

32:00.619 --> 32:03.687
Wordy, grab Sam.
Let's go.

32:08.661 --> 32:09.693
Roger!

32:09.695 --> 32:12.029
Change of plans!

32:16.635 --> 32:19.436
Okay, guys, Mark can't
be too far. He's only got

32:19.438 --> 32:22.506
a couple of minutes on us
in this traffic.
Ava told him we know

32:22.508 --> 32:23.674
about the donor.

32:23.676 --> 32:25.475
That door's closed.

32:25.477 --> 32:28.445
He's running out of time;
he's looking for a new plan.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.280
Sorry, boss,
right under my nose.

32:30.282 --> 32:31.581
Let it go, Jules.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.517
Could've been any one of us.

32:33.519 --> 32:34.584
Spike, any luck?

32:34.586 --> 32:36.586
He's got an old
cell phone, no GPS.

32:36.588 --> 32:38.055
I'm trying to triangulate him.

32:38.057 --> 32:40.057
Sam, any sign?

32:40.059 --> 32:42.225
Nothing yet.

32:42.227 --> 32:44.628
(siren wailing)

32:48.467 --> 32:52.002
You had Chris fake being sick
so you could text Mark?

32:52.004 --> 32:54.371
He doesn't have
to fake being sick.

32:54.373 --> 32:56.373
Okay, come on, Ava,
I know that this is hard...

32:56.375 --> 32:57.374
Do you have
children,

32:57.376 --> 32:58.375
Officer?

32:58.377 --> 33:00.677
No, not yet.

33:00.679 --> 33:03.480
Then you have no idea
how hard this is.

33:03.482 --> 33:07.384
Mark spent years studying
to be a doctor.

33:07.386 --> 33:09.653
All that studying,

33:09.655 --> 33:11.755
but when his own
boy is diagnosed?

33:13.692 --> 33:16.126
I'll tell you one thing
he's doing right now--

33:16.128 --> 33:19.096
he's not giving up.

33:22.768 --> 33:25.135
SPIKE:
Team One, I got a signal
on Mark's phone.

33:25.137 --> 33:26.603
University, near Richmond.

33:26.605 --> 33:27.604
That's near St. Simon's.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.389
That<i> is</i> St. Simon's.

33:29.390 --> 33:31.173
Jules, he may be headed
your way, hostage in tow.

33:31.176 --> 33:32.509
Let's alert hospital security.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.144
Maybe we can get him coming in.

33:34.146 --> 33:35.579
Copy that, boss.

33:35.581 --> 33:36.580
I'm on my way.

33:36.582 --> 33:39.149
(typing)

33:41.253 --> 33:43.253
Mark, I got
your message.

33:43.255 --> 33:45.255
How's Chris?
He's all right, but there's

33:45.257 --> 33:48.125
a cop there talking with
him and Ava right now.

33:48.127 --> 33:49.626
Did they find out you were
planning on paying the donor?

33:49.628 --> 33:51.528
No, it doesn't matter.
What do you mean?

33:51.530 --> 33:53.263
The donor-- he's
not going to do it.

33:53.265 --> 33:55.399
Mark, I'm sorry, man.

33:55.401 --> 33:58.235
Jeff, listen, I need your help.

33:58.237 --> 34:00.470
I need you to test this sample.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.506
What is this?

34:02.508 --> 34:04.741
Look, I need you
to trust me, okay?

34:05.711 --> 34:08.412
Okay.
Thank you.

34:11.083 --> 34:13.083
JULES:<i> No sign</i>
<i> of Mark Logan yet, boss,</i>

34:13.085 --> 34:15.719
but we've got
all the main entrances covered.

34:32.137 --> 34:36.440
Boss, we found Logan's car--
level three of the garage.

34:40.846 --> 34:44.414
Oh, there's blood
in the trunk.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.683
If that's Roger's,
maybe he took him inside.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.385
It's a big hospital,

34:48.387 --> 34:50.654
and we're looking
for a guy with an injury?

34:53.759 --> 34:56.326
If I was Mark right now,
I'd go back to my original plan.

34:56.328 --> 34:57.861
Get Finch's blood tested.

34:57.863 --> 35:00.130
Sam, Wordy,
start a sweep.

35:00.132 --> 35:01.364
See if you can intercept him

35:01.366 --> 35:02.833
or if any of the staff
have seen him.

35:02.835 --> 35:04.568
Copy that.

35:04.570 --> 35:05.569
Got it.

35:05.571 --> 35:07.354
PARKER:
Jules, you stay close

35:07.355 --> 35:09.138
to Chris, in case he tries
to make contact.

35:09.141 --> 35:11.475
Copy that.

35:11.477 --> 35:13.577
Sure, I know
Mark Logan.

35:13.579 --> 35:14.578
Everyone misses
him here.

35:14.580 --> 35:15.846
What's going on?

35:15.848 --> 35:17.447
Well, we think
he came in

35:17.449 --> 35:19.349
with a man named Roger Finch,

35:19.351 --> 35:22.519
wanting to test him
as a possible bone marrow donor.

35:22.521 --> 35:24.187
Well, let's have a look.

35:24.189 --> 35:26.223
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

35:26.225 --> 35:27.390
(typing)

35:27.392 --> 35:29.326
No, there's no Roger Finch
on the list.

35:29.328 --> 35:30.560
The only tests done
this afternoon were

35:30.562 --> 35:31.862
for Michael Copeland,
Terrence Brown,

35:31.864 --> 35:33.663
Audrey Anderson...
Terrence Brown.

35:33.665 --> 35:35.599
Mm-hmm?
PARKER:
Donor for profit.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.534
Uni confirmed
that he never left the hotel.

35:37.536 --> 35:39.136
Hold on, donor for profit?

35:39.138 --> 35:40.604
And Brown's scheduled
for an extraction today.

35:40.606 --> 35:42.606
He's passing Finch off
as Brown.

35:42.608 --> 35:43.840
Doc, are those test
results in yet?

35:43.842 --> 35:46.676
(typing)
Uh...

35:46.678 --> 35:47.878
Brown's blood was compared

35:47.880 --> 35:50.447
with Chris Logan's
for possible BMT

35:50.449 --> 35:52.315
and same HLA type--
he's a match.

35:52.317 --> 35:53.650
Where's the procedure happening?

35:53.652 --> 35:55.352
O.R. three, third floor.

35:55.354 --> 35:57.287
Thank you.

35:57.289 --> 35:59.356
(monitors beeping)

36:02.161 --> 36:04.161
Mark, think about it.

36:04.163 --> 36:05.395
You'll go to prison.

36:05.397 --> 36:06.863
Yeah, and Chris will live.

36:06.865 --> 36:08.665
Please, Jeff, look,
you've known Chris

36:08.667 --> 36:10.200
since he was little.

36:10.202 --> 36:11.668
Please.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.603
Look, what if it was
your daughter?

36:13.605 --> 36:16.173
What if it was Emma--
her life in your hands?

36:16.175 --> 36:19.209
Okay.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.915
O.R. three, third floor.

36:25.884 --> 36:27.884
On our way.

36:27.886 --> 36:29.319
He's come this close.

36:29.321 --> 36:31.855
He's not gonna let
anything stop him now.

36:32.791 --> 36:34.858
(monitors beeping)

36:36.495 --> 36:38.628
So, Mr. Brown...

36:38.630 --> 36:40.630
Just put him under,
he's all set.

36:40.632 --> 36:42.399
This is for
your son, isn't it?

36:42.401 --> 36:43.867
That's right.

36:43.869 --> 36:45.502
Glad to see
you finally found a donor.

36:45.504 --> 36:47.671
Yeah, we were lucky.

36:47.673 --> 36:49.606
Would it be okay
if I stayed

36:49.608 --> 36:50.607
to observe?

36:50.609 --> 36:51.641
I scrubbed.

36:51.643 --> 36:54.211
Sure.

36:54.213 --> 36:55.845
I understand.

36:55.847 --> 36:57.914
So let's have a look.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.986
What are these abrasions
on his forehead?

37:03.922 --> 37:07.424
Hit his head getting
out of the taxi.

37:07.426 --> 37:08.959
I checked him out,
he's fine.

37:15.734 --> 37:19.903
Please, could we just, could
we just get started here?

37:19.905 --> 37:22.672
Is everything
all right, Mark?

37:22.674 --> 37:24.841
Yeah.

37:36.455 --> 37:38.455
End of the hall.

37:38.457 --> 37:40.490
Finch's blood matches Chris'.

37:40.492 --> 37:42.559
Logan's passing him off
as a donor to get his marrow.

37:42.561 --> 37:44.327
So his kid
would live, right?

37:44.329 --> 37:46.396
I hear you, but a donor
has got to be willing.

37:46.398 --> 37:47.397
But they'll both live.

37:47.399 --> 37:49.332
We're trying
to save lives here.

37:49.334 --> 37:50.767
Not our call, Wordy.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.402
I get it--
I'm just saying.

37:52.404 --> 37:54.304
Sam, stay less lethal.

37:54.306 --> 37:55.538
PARKER:
O.R. three-- this is it.

37:55.540 --> 37:56.906
Stand back, please.

37:56.908 --> 37:58.575
Okay, guys,
on three.

37:58.577 --> 38:01.044
One, two...

38:01.046 --> 38:02.479
SRU. Step away
from the patient.

38:02.481 --> 38:03.947
SRU!
Step away!

38:03.949 --> 38:06.783
This patient did not
give his consent...
What's going on?

38:06.785 --> 38:08.785
Do it now!
This patient did not give
his consent.

38:08.787 --> 38:12.322
Stanwell, you do this or I swear
to God I will kill this man.

38:12.324 --> 38:13.323
Mark, that's not
the answer, buddy.

38:13.325 --> 38:14.491
Well, what is the answer?!

38:14.493 --> 38:16.826
Because my son is dying
right now!

38:16.828 --> 38:18.528
Mark, just listen to me, buddy.

38:18.530 --> 38:20.330
Marrow can be harvested
hours after he is dead,

38:20.332 --> 38:22.532
and I swear I will do this
if I have to.

38:22.534 --> 38:24.501
I will kill this man
to save my son.

38:26.438 --> 38:28.505
You've taken an oath
to preserve life.

38:28.507 --> 38:30.840
You'd be killing Chris
if you didn't use it.

38:32.577 --> 38:35.011
Are we going ahead
with this procedure or not?!

38:40.452 --> 38:41.351
Your choice.

38:41.353 --> 38:42.886
(gunshots)

38:42.887 --> 38:44.420
ED:
Stay down, stay down!

38:48.593 --> 38:50.560
Help me, please.
(handcuffs click)

38:50.562 --> 38:51.728
My son is gonna die.

38:51.730 --> 38:54.597
Please, please don't do this.

38:54.599 --> 38:57.734
My son is gonna die.

38:57.736 --> 39:00.337
Please.

39:02.074 --> 39:04.774
You're such a
good boy, Chris.

39:04.776 --> 39:08.445
You know that your dad and I--
we love you so much.

39:08.447 --> 39:09.446
CHRIS:
I know.

39:09.448 --> 39:10.914
Oh, please,

39:10.916 --> 39:12.749
let me say good-bye
to my son.

39:12.751 --> 39:13.750
Let me say good-bye.

39:13.752 --> 39:15.919
Just let me
say good-bye.

39:15.921 --> 39:16.953
AVA:
Can you do that?

39:16.955 --> 39:17.954
CHRIS:
Yes.

39:17.956 --> 39:20.123
Yeah.

39:20.125 --> 39:22.826
AVA:
And once this is done,
I'm gonna be right here

39:22.828 --> 39:24.494
when you get out, okay?

39:25.764 --> 39:28.798
And when it's all over,
I'm gonna take you to the...

39:29.768 --> 39:31.835
Mark.

39:32.804 --> 39:34.804
Mark.

39:34.806 --> 39:36.406
I'm so sorry.

39:36.408 --> 39:38.675
Don't be sorry.

39:42.547 --> 39:45.515
Don't be sorry.

39:45.517 --> 39:47.517
Hey.

39:47.519 --> 39:50.487
Hey, buddy.

39:50.489 --> 39:53.623
Listen, we are going to
find you another donor,

39:53.625 --> 39:55.558
and everything is going
to be fine, okay?

39:55.560 --> 39:57.060
Don't worry, Dad, it's okay.

40:00.499 --> 40:02.499
Oh, man, I am so proud of you.

40:02.501 --> 40:05.034
He's not even scared.

40:05.036 --> 40:08.638
He's trying to comfort them.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.707
It isn't right.

40:13.412 --> 40:15.478
No.

40:19.618 --> 40:21.651
PARKER:
There's a police officer
in the hallway--

40:21.653 --> 40:23.920
he'll take you back to the
station when you're done here.

40:23.922 --> 40:24.921
Okay.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.156
Do you even know his name?

40:26.158 --> 40:27.023
PARKER:
What are you doing?

40:27.025 --> 40:28.024
It's Chris.

40:28.026 --> 40:29.058
Did you know that?

40:29.060 --> 40:30.093
Look, I...

40:30.095 --> 40:31.528
Did you know
that he has

40:31.530 --> 40:33.062
your eyes?

40:33.064 --> 40:35.698
Except for his eyes see things
differently than you do.

40:35.700 --> 40:37.534
His eyes are brave,

40:37.536 --> 40:40.837
and when he looks at you,
he looks right into you

40:40.839 --> 40:43.673
and you believe
what he believes.

40:43.675 --> 40:46.209
You believe that
anything is possible.

40:48.847 --> 40:51.181
He might be dead by the time
you have dessert tonight.

40:51.183 --> 40:52.482
You all right with that?

40:52.484 --> 40:53.650
No, of course not.

40:53.652 --> 40:55.185
And you're a match, right?

40:55.186 --> 40:56.719
They told you
that your blood's a match.

40:56.721 --> 40:58.988
Not that it's my business--
I'm just saying.

41:00.926 --> 41:03.660
GINA:
Roger, w-what
were you thinking?

41:03.662 --> 41:06.079
Gina, look, I was...

41:06.080 --> 41:08.497
I was protecting you and the
girls, that's all, I was...

41:10.101 --> 41:12.535
Just doing the right thing?
