32:34.416 --> 32:36.750
I mean no insult or quarrel, I just...

32:38.416 --> 32:40.291
I have limited thought, and...

32:41.541 --> 32:42.541
Sorry.

32:50.375 --> 32:52.083
No, I apologize, Jeremy.

32:54.791 --> 32:56.083
Forgive my lack of grace.

32:57.458 --> 32:59.125
I will gladly forgive you, sir...

33:02.583 --> 33:04.333
so long as you'll be so good
as to help me?

33:06.208 --> 33:07.125
With what?

33:12.416 --> 33:13.916
You dragged this here by yourself?

33:14.958 --> 33:16.333
Not I. A man.

33:17.708 --> 33:21.000
Malcolm, he says the man wanted
to bring death here. Says he was a spy.

33:21.583 --> 33:23.291
He tried to leave, but the sea took him.

33:24.833 --> 33:26.125
She protected us.

33:30.666 --> 33:31.500
Did she?

33:40.000 --> 33:41.666
Do many seek to leave the island?

33:42.125 --> 33:43.458
Just the blasphemers.

33:47.166 --> 33:49.083
Are they granted safe passage?

33:49.166 --> 33:51.666
Why do you ask, sir?
You've been here but a day.

33:52.375 --> 33:54.041
I can trust you, can't I, Jeremy?

33:54.500 --> 33:56.500
Of course, sir. What bothers you?

34:01.916 --> 34:03.791
-Sir, I must go now.
-No, you don't!

34:06.708 --> 34:09.125
You know her. Yes, you do,
I can see that you do.

34:10.500 --> 34:12.416
For Christ's sake, be a man, not a child.

34:12.500 --> 34:15.291
-I don't know of what you speak.
-You're lying!

34:15.375 --> 34:16.958
Please, I should go. I should.

34:17.791 --> 34:20.666
Look her in the eye and lie to me again.
You know her.

34:20.750 --> 34:21.708
Say it.

34:27.083 --> 34:27.916
I knew her.

34:30.958 --> 34:32.916
A month ago, she was on our boat.

34:35.250 --> 34:36.666
Frank said we had no choice.

34:38.583 --> 34:41.458
The crops are failing,
the animals have stopped breeding.

34:42.791 --> 34:45.458
We have no means to smuggle food
in from the mainland.

34:47.875 --> 34:49.291
He said her father was rich,

34:49.416 --> 34:51.666
but we only wanted his money
so we wouldn't starve.

34:53.083 --> 34:54.041
But it never came.

34:56.166 --> 34:58.625
[muffled whimpering]

35:04.625 --> 35:06.541
[muffled screaming]

35:24.375 --> 35:25.666
Why didn't you help her?

35:27.083 --> 35:28.416
Look at me, Mr. Richardson.

35:29.166 --> 35:31.666
If they thought I had any part,
if they caught her in my charge--

35:31.750 --> 35:32.916
They? Who's they?

35:33.041 --> 35:35.916
Prophet Malcolm's guards.
Please, sir, I beg of you.

35:36.541 --> 35:38.708
If you are in possession of the ransom
they seek, do not pay it.

35:47.833 --> 35:49.166
You, boy, are in my charge.

35:49.791 --> 35:52.166
If you wish to keep your affair
with that girl in the shadows,

35:52.250 --> 35:54.375
you will serve me during my time
on this land,

35:54.458 --> 35:57.416
and hold fast the purpose
of my being here. Do you understand?

36:00.458 --> 36:01.291
Good.

36:04.458 --> 36:06.583
-[distressed bleating]
-[Malcolm] Hold her down, for fuck's sake!

36:08.708 --> 36:10.208
Jesus, it's turned.

36:11.416 --> 36:12.458
Pull.

36:17.125 --> 36:19.458
[man straining and grunting]

36:25.166 --> 36:27.375
[feeble bleating]

36:35.125 --> 36:36.666
We cannot go on like this.

36:41.666 --> 36:43.458
[panting]

36:43.541 --> 36:45.833
She will gift us another pure harvest.

36:47.250 --> 36:48.166
Have faith.

36:53.041 --> 36:54.833
[bell clanging]

36:57.541 --> 37:01.458
All new arrivals,
please make your way to the church!

37:21.000 --> 37:21.916
Ffion?

37:23.958 --> 37:24.833
What is it?

37:25.875 --> 37:26.750
Tell me.

37:33.958 --> 37:36.750
You're... you're knowledgeable.

37:39.541 --> 37:40.875
You would know if I...

37:41.666 --> 37:42.958
if I should be with child.

37:46.416 --> 37:48.416
Well, first, you and Jeremy
would have to...

37:48.833 --> 37:51.125
Frequently... For many moons.

38:04.458 --> 38:06.208
Andrea, I know what we do is a sin.

38:07.458 --> 38:08.500
Do you love him?

38:09.583 --> 38:10.583
With all my heart.

38:11.291 --> 38:13.375
Then do not judge yourself as sinners.

38:15.958 --> 38:17.416
When was it you last bled?

38:18.666 --> 38:19.791
The winter months.

38:21.166 --> 38:22.833
That may already be your answer.

38:24.083 --> 38:26.041
But there are ways to see...

38:26.458 --> 38:27.541
To know--

38:27.625 --> 38:28.458
Sorry.

38:33.958 --> 38:36.333
All new arrivals are requested
at the church.

38:48.791 --> 38:50.333
As the leader of this community,

38:50.416 --> 38:53.875
it seems I have failed to make clear
the rules...

38:55.041 --> 38:56.250
that bind us.

38:59.166 --> 39:01.083
Under no circumstances...

39:01.583 --> 39:04.583
are any members of this village,
new or old,

39:05.791 --> 39:10.541
permitted to venture out
after the ringing of the night bell.

39:12.083 --> 39:14.666
But last night... [chuckles]

39:15.458 --> 39:16.625
one of you...

39:18.083 --> 39:18.958
broke that rule.

39:23.458 --> 39:26.333
Kneel... if you would be so kind.

39:35.208 --> 39:36.208
Book of Therese,

39:37.041 --> 39:38.875
verse seven, chapter 12.

39:39.625 --> 39:41.166
"For I shall profit not...

39:42.500 --> 39:44.166
I will seek not..."

39:46.958 --> 39:48.625
"...the gold of my brother,

39:49.791 --> 39:52.416
for he hath not more than I,
nor I than him.

39:53.166 --> 39:54.083
For my life--"

39:54.166 --> 39:55.125
Shh, shh.

40:03.625 --> 40:06.000
"For my life is not defined
by consumption,

40:06.083 --> 40:08.208
wealth, and material goods.

40:08.791 --> 40:12.208
It is an echo of my neighbor
and of my neighbor's neighbor.

40:13.708 --> 40:14.833
We, the people of--"

40:15.958 --> 40:17.916
[Malcolm's footsteps approaching]

40:19.083 --> 40:21.208
[man] "We, the people of Erisden,

40:21.833 --> 40:23.541
stand bonded in our unity,

40:24.125 --> 40:26.250
stand united through equality,

40:26.333 --> 40:27.625
for we shall suffer not,

40:28.541 --> 40:29.541
shall want not."

40:46.791 --> 40:47.666
Well?

40:52.791 --> 40:54.583
For King and country!

40:56.541 --> 40:57.791
[both grunting]

41:00.583 --> 41:01.625
Agh!

41:04.041 --> 41:06.791
[panting]

41:42.166 --> 41:44.166
This heathen land...

41:45.708 --> 41:48.166
will... burn!

41:52.541 --> 41:53.875
[knife clanging on floor]

41:55.958 --> 41:57.250
[Thomas panting]

41:57.375 --> 41:58.541
[groaning]

42:01.208 --> 42:02.208
Agh!

42:02.833 --> 42:04.208
Treat the man! Do it!

42:05.458 --> 42:06.583
Agh!

42:09.333 --> 42:12.833
He was from the mainland. An assassin.
His knife has the King's markings.

42:13.416 --> 42:15.333
Did you bring anyone at all
that you weren't supposed to?

42:15.500 --> 42:16.708
[Thomas moaning]

42:23.458 --> 42:26.750
If the knife of that bastard
cut just one of us,

42:27.375 --> 42:28.916
we all bleed together.

42:29.583 --> 42:33.333
If your blood has been shed in my name,
I shed mine for you.

42:34.208 --> 42:35.791
-Father!
-[grunts]

42:38.458 --> 42:40.000
I'm indebted to you, brother.

42:40.583 --> 42:42.750
Your act of bravery
shall not go unrewarded.

42:43.291 --> 42:44.333
You have my word.

42:47.416 --> 42:50.333
Today the King sends spies.
How long before he sends ships?

42:51.000 --> 42:53.333
I want spotters stationed
along the coastline.

42:53.416 --> 42:54.500
Strengthen our defense.

42:54.583 --> 42:57.250
-Load the carriages, arm the barricade.
-Aye!

42:57.333 --> 42:59.708
-Travel to the north point.
-To the north point!

43:00.708 --> 43:01.708
[groaning]

43:03.041 --> 43:05.333
[muffled screaming]

43:06.000 --> 43:07.291
We're not done here yet.

43:07.875 --> 43:10.541
The intruder still walks,
and we have a ransom to find.

43:11.458 --> 43:12.875
All right, collect the girl.

43:13.291 --> 43:16.625
If he insists on remaining hidden,
we'll show him the consequences.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.625
[horse trotting and neighing]

43:41.500 --> 43:42.833
Afraid I spilt a little.

43:43.500 --> 43:44.458
How dare you!

43:47.375 --> 43:49.208
How long did this collection take?

43:50.875 --> 43:53.083
Trinkets like these
are not easily acquired.

43:53.750 --> 43:54.833
My uncle.

43:55.500 --> 43:56.750
My mother's kin.

43:57.708 --> 43:58.541
He's a doctor.

44:01.458 --> 44:02.458
Is that your mother?

44:03.750 --> 44:04.583
Yes.

44:05.541 --> 44:06.791
She died giving birth to me.

44:07.708 --> 44:08.833
I'm sorry.

44:11.666 --> 44:13.500
My uncle says I remind him of her.

44:14.583 --> 44:16.875
Says it gives him peace to know
she lives through me.

44:18.583 --> 44:20.916
All my life, he's been the only one
who could look at me,

44:21.000 --> 44:22.583
see her, and still smile.

44:26.083 --> 44:27.041
My father...

44:29.375 --> 44:31.333
sometimes I can just see it his eyes.

44:33.166 --> 44:34.250
A resentment.

44:35.583 --> 44:36.708
Do you resent him?

44:38.166 --> 44:40.500
-Sir?
-Your father, for bringing you here.

44:41.291 --> 44:43.041
-Mr. Richardson--
-Don't misunderstand me.

44:43.125 --> 44:44.583
I'm glad that he did, but...

44:45.666 --> 44:48.083
You strike me as somebody
with more to give this world

44:48.166 --> 44:50.458
than merely being the daughter
of a prophet.

44:54.166 --> 44:56.916
-Do you resent yours?
-Oh, every day.

45:01.875 --> 45:04.166
A few drops of these
should see you through the night.

45:23.125 --> 45:25.125
I'll come by tomorrow
to change your bandages.

45:29.791 --> 45:31.500
Thank you, Miss Howe.

46:13.166 --> 46:15.000
[bell clanging]

46:16.250 --> 46:18.250
[man] Call to quarters!

46:27.125 --> 46:29.125
[Malcolm] People of Erisden!

46:31.041 --> 46:32.291
Hear me!

46:34.416 --> 46:36.250
The woman you see before you...

46:38.041 --> 46:40.458
has broken the laws of our land!

46:43.166 --> 46:46.625
She is an agent of a dying god...

46:47.458 --> 46:49.125
and a weak King.

46:51.083 --> 46:53.208
She's come here to corrupt...

46:54.000 --> 46:55.916
and destroy our community!

46:59.375 --> 47:00.375
But...

47:01.458 --> 47:02.666
there is another.

47:04.833 --> 47:07.208
Her kin is here also.

47:08.583 --> 47:10.250
Co-conspirator!

47:13.333 --> 47:14.958
I call to him now!

47:16.166 --> 47:17.541
Make yourself known.

47:18.791 --> 47:21.416
Make good... on the debt...

47:22.041 --> 47:22.958
that she owes...

47:25.166 --> 47:27.291
and forgiveness shall be hers.

47:29.666 --> 47:31.250
Stay in the shadows...

47:32.708 --> 47:36.000
and it be the Heathen's Stand
that awaits ye both!

47:51.666 --> 47:52.625
Very well.

48:05.750 --> 48:07.541
[Jennifer whimpering]

48:16.916 --> 48:18.916
No! No!

48:19.500 --> 48:21.500
Don't! No!

48:22.958 --> 48:24.083
[crying] No!

48:25.083 --> 48:25.916
No, no!

48:26.000 --> 48:27.375
[screaming]

48:27.458 --> 48:28.291
Stop!

48:29.125 --> 48:29.958
Stop!

48:31.541 --> 48:32.833
Please, no!

48:32.916 --> 48:34.375
[screaming]

48:36.541 --> 48:39.000
[Malcolm] The sands of time are sinking!

48:41.791 --> 48:43.791
Her life is in your hands!

49:39.208 --> 49:41.041
[birds chirping]

50:47.000 --> 50:47.875
[creak]

51:16.208 --> 51:18.375

[boys and girls laughing]

51:48.458 --> 51:49.791
[yells]

51:52.791 --> 51:54.875
Let them play.

52:09.291 --> 52:11.291
[boys resume laughing]

52:38.916 --> 52:40.416
-You good?
-Aye.

52:49.500 --> 52:51.583
We don't have the resources
for this, Malcolm.

52:52.583 --> 52:55.333
These festivities will decimate
our livestock.

52:56.583 --> 52:58.541
Celebrating our way into starvation.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.166
Tonight, while they celebrate...

53:04.083 --> 53:05.625
we'll search their rooms.

53:07.916 --> 53:09.333
If he's here, we'll know it.

53:09.916 --> 53:12.541
First, we find the money, then we'll...

53:14.541 --> 53:17.791
Well, we'll deal with them both.
Trust me, this ends tonight.

53:20.625 --> 53:21.500
Andrea?

53:33.666 --> 53:35.125
Off from her, now!

53:36.500 --> 53:38.416
Can we at least
afford this woman her dignity?

53:53.458 --> 53:55.125
[Jennifer whimpering]

53:55.208 --> 53:56.083
Slowly.

53:57.125 --> 53:58.958
Slowly, or your body will reject it.

54:02.458 --> 54:03.500
Thank you.

54:11.166 --> 54:13.791
I'll see to it that no one harms you.
I promise.

54:15.666 --> 54:16.750
Just hold strong.

54:37.416 --> 54:39.708
[hammering]

54:47.625 --> 54:48.500
[guard] Come on!

54:52.333 --> 54:53.166
Get up!

55:00.958 --> 55:01.791
Go!

55:17.375 --> 55:18.208
Be ready.

[footsteps running away]

56:38.375 --> 56:40.375
[fiddle and drum music]

56:47.708 --> 56:48.708
Good evening.

56:51.250 --> 56:53.250
[laughter and chatter]

56:56.750 --> 56:57.833
Well, hello.

56:59.083 --> 57:00.125
What's all this?

57:00.291 --> 57:02.750
There's more to life
than harvest and prayer, Mr. Richardson.

57:02.833 --> 57:05.291
It's called "fun". You should try it.

57:05.416 --> 57:08.250
-Thomas.
-Are you going to ask me to dance?

57:08.333 --> 57:11.500
[chuckles] It would be an honor,
my lady, but...

57:12.166 --> 57:14.250
do you think the prophet will permit?

57:15.000 --> 57:16.750
I'm not sure my father would be persuaded.

57:18.458 --> 57:22.375
I sincerely doubt he'd be happy
with hands such as these...

57:23.083 --> 57:24.750
on the hips of his good little girl.

57:30.750 --> 57:33.000
These are far from scholarly hands,
Mr. Richardson.

57:33.750 --> 57:34.708
Thomas.

57:35.958 --> 57:37.666
And I never proclaimed to be as such.

57:39.791 --> 57:40.666
Your eyes...

57:42.166 --> 57:43.416
they've seen things.

57:48.083 --> 57:49.166
Who are you?

57:51.750 --> 57:53.041
Will you excuse me, Andrea?

57:54.291 --> 57:55.166
Wait.

58:02.000 --> 58:02.916
Come on.

58:11.458 --> 58:13.208
[fiddle and drum music ends]

58:13.291 --> 58:14.875
[applause]

58:16.916 --> 58:19.875
-I found these.
-You've done well. Let's go.

58:59.333 --> 59:01.125
[hammering in time to the drum]

59:10.708 --> 59:12.375
We're wasting our time here, Quinn.

59:14.583 --> 59:15.916
Every room, Malcolm.

59:18.291 --> 59:19.291
Let's move on!

59:55.958 --> 59:56.875
What is it?

59:59.958 --> 1:00:00.875
It's the house.

1:00:06.458 --> 1:00:08.041
Frank! Frank!

1:00:08.541 --> 1:00:09.375
The house!

1:00:20.208 --> 1:00:22.208
-Close it after. Don't seal it.
-Yes, sir.

1:00:23.958 --> 1:00:26.958
Jeremy... if you meet any trouble...

1:00:27.625 --> 1:00:28.708
use this.

1:00:29.375 --> 1:00:30.458
No matter who it is.

1:00:34.958 --> 1:00:35.833
Thank you.

Get!

1:01:30.625 --> 1:01:31.833
[whimpering]

[Quinn] Frank!

1:01:47.416 --> 1:01:48.375
Frank!

1:01:48.458 --> 1:01:49.291
Down here.

1:01:53.708 --> 1:01:54.750
He's inside.

1:01:57.625 --> 1:02:00.041
Okay, Frank, take my hunting rifle,
get down there and flush him out.

1:02:00.125 --> 1:02:01.708
Quinn, stand guard should he return.

1:02:04.166 --> 1:02:05.375
Should be me down there.

1:02:05.458 --> 1:02:08.333
I want him a prisoner in possession
of answers, not a corpse.

1:02:31.958 --> 1:02:32.791
Frank.

1:02:53.375 --> 1:02:54.250
Don't hesitate.

1:02:55.541 --> 1:02:56.791
You see him, you shoot him.

1:10:15.791 --> 1:10:17.000
You showed yourself.

1:10:19.291 --> 1:10:20.125
To him.

1:10:22.083 --> 1:10:22.916
Why?

1:10:29.458 --> 1:10:30.875
He's not to be trusted.

1:10:34.666 --> 1:10:36.125
He won't worship you...

1:10:37.458 --> 1:10:38.416
as I.

1:10:39.958 --> 1:10:40.791

Ah.

1:10:50.750 --> 1:10:52.875

1:10:52.958 --> 1:10:55.708
No more shall you poison our crop.

1:10:57.375 --> 1:10:59.208
I swear you shall starve,

1:10:59.291 --> 1:11:01.583
lest you give us pure harvest!

No!

No!

1:12:17.208 --> 1:12:18.291

1:12:22.375 --> 1:12:23.333
You found it.

1:12:29.375 --> 1:12:30.333
What is this?

1:12:33.041 --> 1:12:34.125
You wouldn't believe me.

1:12:38.500 --> 1:12:39.333
Here.

1:12:39.916 --> 1:12:41.125
Change into these.

1:13:04.041 --> 1:13:05.083
What happened to you?

1:13:10.416 --> 1:13:11.458
My faith.

1:13:13.416 --> 1:13:15.625
I once held fast a belief in the divine.

1:13:17.250 --> 1:13:18.250
Like you, I...

1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:20.791
knelt before a deity.

1:13:25.958 --> 1:13:28.750
Armed with the book of Jesus Christ, I...

1:13:29.916 --> 1:13:32.750
led my parish into the heart of Peking.

1:13:35.083 --> 1:13:39.541
And we showed them the glory
and the love of God himself...

1:13:41.833 --> 1:13:43.750
and then they showed us the Devil.

1:13:47.125 --> 1:13:48.458

[gasping and panting]

1:14:26.958 --> 1:14:29.791
Blessed be, my Father,
I beg of You, hear my prayer!

1:14:31.375 --> 1:14:32.333
Agh!

1:14:37.500 --> 1:14:40.333
As Your faithful servant,
in this hour of need,

1:14:40.416 --> 1:14:42.958
I pray for Your divine intervention!

[cloth ripping]

1:15:09.916 --> 1:15:11.166
Agh!

1:15:19.333 --> 1:15:23.041
The promise of the Divine
is but an illusion.

1:15:24.125 --> 1:15:25.875
Nothing in this world is pure...

1:15:27.041 --> 1:15:28.291
except for Jennifer...

1:15:28.875 --> 1:15:29.875
my sister.

1:15:31.250 --> 1:15:32.250
Always in my heart.

1:15:33.875 --> 1:15:35.833
She did not abandon me then...

1:15:36.791 --> 1:15:38.791
and I will not abandon her now.

1:15:39.916 --> 1:15:41.125
As for God,

1:15:41.666 --> 1:15:45.083
he left me, left all of us to suffer.

1:15:47.583 --> 1:15:48.875
But you survived.

1:15:49.416 --> 1:15:51.166
Only my body, and barely that.

1:15:52.583 --> 1:15:53.833
God is pain...

1:15:53.916 --> 1:15:55.791
is... suffering...

1:15:56.916 --> 1:15:58.208
-is betrayal.
-Is forgiveness.

1:15:58.291 --> 1:15:59.208
Tsk.

1:15:59.833 --> 1:16:01.208
Thomas, let me help you.

1:16:01.791 --> 1:16:03.958
Says the daughter of the man
who wants me dead.

1:16:04.541 --> 1:16:06.750
No. Not I, and not my father.

1:16:06.833 --> 1:16:08.958
Child, you must be blind
to think otherwise.

1:16:09.958 --> 1:16:13.000
He may be many things, Mr. Richardson,
but he's not a murderer.

1:16:14.291 --> 1:16:16.125
-He wouldn't.
-Oh, he would.

1:16:17.375 --> 1:16:18.458
And he has.

1:16:20.583 --> 1:16:25.250
"Beware of false prophets
which come to you in sheep's clothing,

1:16:25.333 --> 1:16:28.500
but inwardly they are ravening wolves."

1:16:28.916 --> 1:16:31.166
Andrea, you know it to be true.

1:16:33.375 --> 1:16:34.666
My sister...

1:16:35.875 --> 1:16:37.250
is no traitor.

1:16:38.250 --> 1:16:39.708
No spy.

1:16:41.083 --> 1:16:42.625
She didn't come here.

1:16:44.333 --> 1:16:45.333
She was taken.

1:16:47.416 --> 1:16:50.208
[waves crashing]

1:17:32.041 --> 1:17:33.041
Frank?

1:17:59.458 --> 1:18:00.625
She provided for us...

1:18:01.666 --> 1:18:02.583
once.

1:18:03.125 --> 1:18:04.708
Enough of your superstition.

1:18:08.291 --> 1:18:09.125
Where are we?

1:18:09.250 --> 1:18:11.666
Worry not.
They won't know to look for you here.

1:18:28.166 --> 1:18:29.208
It's toxic.

1:18:31.958 --> 1:18:34.708
All the crops have become riddled
with impurities.

1:18:38.083 --> 1:18:38.958
Look.

1:18:43.833 --> 1:18:44.791
All this land...

1:18:45.416 --> 1:18:47.791
it's scorched earth that we live upon.

1:18:48.458 --> 1:18:50.416
And yet, somehow, it grows.

1:18:51.458 --> 1:18:52.458
Why now?

1:18:53.375 --> 1:18:54.666
I don't know.

1:18:56.125 --> 1:18:57.875
Perhaps her strength is fading.

1:19:00.500 --> 1:19:02.083
Or something has angered her.

1:19:12.458 --> 1:19:13.291
Pregnant?

1:19:32.750 --> 1:19:37.166
Ffion, Frank wants I should travel
with him today to the mainland.

1:19:37.250 --> 1:19:39.583
Then I'll be at shore
to greet you at sunrise.

1:19:40.250 --> 1:19:41.458
He wants I should stay there.

1:19:44.250 --> 1:19:45.083
Jeremy...

1:19:45.166 --> 1:19:48.000
And I want only should you be there
by my side...

1:19:50.458 --> 1:19:51.541
as my wife.

1:19:55.208 --> 1:19:56.458
[chuckles]

1:19:57.958 --> 1:19:59.416
Well, you know yourself,

1:19:59.791 --> 1:20:03.041
your father would never allow it.
Me, you...

1:20:04.708 --> 1:20:05.625
us...

1:20:06.833 --> 1:20:07.791
our child.

1:20:10.958 --> 1:20:12.166
We could be together...

1:20:12.875 --> 1:20:14.541
any time of any day.

1:20:17.125 --> 1:20:19.000
-Free.
-To love each other.

1:20:27.125 --> 1:20:27.958
Wait.

1:20:29.166 --> 1:20:31.375
Wait right here.
I have something... for us.

1:20:44.625 --> 1:20:45.666
[Ffion gasping]

1:21:17.875 --> 1:21:18.708
Father?

1:21:19.166 --> 1:21:20.708
Father, please. I can explain.

1:21:20.791 --> 1:21:22.875
Please! I was going to tell you. Please--

1:21:23.666 --> 1:21:24.583
Agh!

1:21:25.083 --> 1:21:26.458
[sobbing]

1:21:26.583 --> 1:21:27.666
Tell me now!

1:21:28.250 --> 1:21:30.041
What suspicions have ye confirmed?

1:21:30.125 --> 1:21:31.458
Father, no!

1:21:31.541 --> 1:21:32.416
No!

1:21:32.500 --> 1:21:35.833
Inform me, child!
Lest I see what ye hide!

1:21:37.291 --> 1:21:38.708
It's mine to keep!

1:21:56.458 --> 1:21:57.500
Where you going, Frank?

1:22:01.166 --> 1:22:02.416
The boy and me are leaving.

1:22:04.208 --> 1:22:05.166
Frank...

1:22:05.500 --> 1:22:06.416
Sorry, Malcolm.

1:22:07.791 --> 1:22:10.041
I can't be part of this anymore.
I won't.

1:22:11.500 --> 1:22:12.750
This community needs you.

1:22:15.541 --> 1:22:16.375
I need you.

1:22:17.791 --> 1:22:18.875
You need my boat.

1:22:20.625 --> 1:22:22.333
I was happy following you

1:22:22.416 --> 1:22:24.333
when this was all about the word
of your heart.

1:22:24.416 --> 1:22:25.916
Come on, Frank. This...

1:22:26.541 --> 1:22:27.750
this is our island.

1:22:29.250 --> 1:22:30.250
We built this...

1:22:31.041 --> 1:22:34.083
with our own hands. You, me... Quinn.

1:22:35.958 --> 1:22:37.333
It's our paradise.

1:22:37.916 --> 1:22:41.666
No. It's our hell,
and I'm dragging the boy down with me.

1:22:41.750 --> 1:22:43.083
And you, your Andrea.

1:22:44.458 --> 1:22:45.416
No, no.

1:22:45.500 --> 1:22:47.333
No, no, you're wrong, Frank.

1:22:47.916 --> 1:22:50.750
We have homes here. We have families.

1:22:51.916 --> 1:22:53.916
-We have faith.
-[sighing] Oh, faith...

1:22:55.083 --> 1:22:59.250
We have a god in chains
poisoning us from the inside out.

1:22:59.875 --> 1:23:02.333
We have an innocent man's blood
on our hands.

1:23:03.083 --> 1:23:05.500
We have a kidnapped girl, held for ransom.

1:23:05.583 --> 1:23:09.708
I'll go to my grave washing the blood
of that wee soul from my hands.

1:23:10.666 --> 1:23:13.250
This place, this community, it's broken.

1:23:13.333 --> 1:23:14.416
Then we'll fix it!

1:23:22.833 --> 1:23:23.875
Together.

1:23:26.375 --> 1:23:27.583
It's finished.

1:23:28.458 --> 1:23:30.041
You know it in your heart.

1:23:37.958 --> 1:23:38.916
Whose is it?

1:23:42.875 --> 1:23:44.333
Who put that inside you?

1:23:44.875 --> 1:23:45.708
Please...

1:23:46.583 --> 1:23:48.958
Father, do not see it
for the judgment of his actions.

1:23:49.041 --> 1:23:50.875
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1:23:51.458 --> 1:23:52.375
Pray no.

1:23:53.583 --> 1:23:56.333
-Not him.
-He followed only what I asked.

1:23:59.708 --> 1:24:01.875
This is a harlot's tongue!

1:24:02.916 --> 1:24:05.500
Them be a whore's lips
that move before me!

1:24:05.625 --> 1:24:07.250
Look into my eyes,

1:24:07.583 --> 1:24:11.958
and see the daughter that stands
frightened and in need of a father's love!

1:24:12.083 --> 1:24:16.333
You have no idea
what monstrosity grows inside you!

1:24:18.833 --> 1:24:20.541
This is an abomination!

1:24:21.458 --> 1:24:24.375
-A bastard mongoloid breed!
-No!

1:24:24.750 --> 1:24:28.208
To be born in lumps of twisted flesh
no mother would ever call her own.

1:24:28.333 --> 1:24:30.833
-No!
-Yes... child.

1:24:32.458 --> 1:24:33.833
I've seen it.

1:24:36.166 --> 1:24:37.041
I've seen it.

1:24:38.666 --> 1:24:39.791
That thing...

1:24:41.208 --> 1:24:42.500
It will kill you.

1:24:45.041 --> 1:24:46.833
[sobbing]

1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:52.416
I won't stand for it.

1:24:57.666 --> 1:24:58.583
Here.

1:25:00.041 --> 1:25:01.000
No! No!

1:25:01.083 --> 1:25:02.458
No! Stop!

1:25:21.458 --> 1:25:22.500
Ffion?

1:25:30.291 --> 1:25:31.250
[Quinn] You did this.

1:25:38.083 --> 1:25:39.208
You put your seed...

1:25:40.625 --> 1:25:42.833
inside my beautiful angel.

1:25:52.458 --> 1:25:54.166
I had no choice.

1:25:58.833 --> 1:25:59.916
My Ffion.

1:26:01.375 --> 1:26:02.875
My daughter!

1:26:04.750 --> 1:26:05.625
And you...

1:26:07.666 --> 1:26:09.125
took her from me.

1:26:18.833 --> 1:26:19.750
[Quinn] Agh!

1:26:31.208 --> 1:26:32.750
-[razor slicing]
[Quinn] Agh!

1:26:37.666 --> 1:26:38.583
Agh!

1:26:47.250 --> 1:26:49.208
Agh! Agh!

1:26:51.250 --> 1:26:53.000
[screaming]

1:27:02.666 --> 1:27:03.625
Help!

1:27:04.041 --> 1:27:05.833
Help! Help!

1:27:06.833 --> 1:27:08.625
Help! Help!

1:27:09.541 --> 1:27:10.541
Somebody help!

1:27:11.166 --> 1:27:12.375
He killed her!

1:27:13.291 --> 1:27:14.833
He killed my girl!

1:27:15.625 --> 1:27:16.458
No...

1:27:16.833 --> 1:27:17.750
No, I didn't.

1:27:18.625 --> 1:27:19.541
Murderer!

1:27:20.250 --> 1:27:21.833
Don't let him escape!

1:27:22.416 --> 1:27:23.458
After him!

1:27:24.625 --> 1:27:25.625
After him!

1:27:26.333 --> 1:27:27.250
[guard] This way!

1:27:42.541 --> 1:27:44.541
Prepare the Heathen's Stand!

1:27:46.166 --> 1:27:48.916
By order of purification!

1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:51.125
[man] But, sir, only Prophet Malcolm--

1:27:51.250 --> 1:27:54.666
Malcolm is not the divine ruler
of this land!

1:27:59.458 --> 1:28:00.916
Now, follow my orders.

1:28:02.375 --> 1:28:03.458
Or I swear...

1:28:04.375 --> 1:28:06.041
by the blood of my kin...

1:28:06.875 --> 1:28:08.833
ye shall face the same fate.

1:28:11.750 --> 1:28:12.750
Now!

1:28:16.416 --> 1:28:17.875
Sound the alarm.

1:28:20.958 --> 1:28:21.958

1:28:41.750 --> 1:28:43.333
[distant bell clanging]

1:28:44.375 --> 1:28:45.375
What's happening?

1:28:54.541 --> 1:28:56.416
[rustling]

1:28:56.500 --> 1:28:58.458
[panting]

1:29:08.541 --> 1:29:09.708
Andrea!

1:29:10.875 --> 1:29:12.208
Jeremy! Jeremy!

1:29:12.291 --> 1:29:15.333
Please, help me. I didn't hurt her.
I swear I didn't touch her!

1:29:15.416 --> 1:29:17.541
What are you talking about?
What's happened?

1:29:18.916 --> 1:29:20.375
Jeremy, where is Ffion?

1:29:21.583 --> 1:29:24.791
I didn't do it! It was him.
He ripped our child from her!

1:29:25.583 --> 1:29:26.625
[striking blows]

1:29:26.708 --> 1:29:28.500
-Jeremy!
-Get back!

1:29:29.291 --> 1:29:32.041
The boy killed her.
He needs to be purified.

1:29:32.125 --> 1:29:33.375
-No!
-Pick him up!

1:29:33.458 --> 1:29:34.375
No!

1:29:34.458 --> 1:29:35.458
Jeremy!

1:29:36.458 --> 1:29:37.625
Jeremy!

1:29:39.416 --> 1:29:40.833
Listen to his words!

1:29:41.041 --> 1:29:42.166
Listen!

1:29:44.333 --> 1:29:45.750
Jeremy! Agh!

1:30:52.458 --> 1:30:53.625
You monster!

1:30:55.875 --> 1:30:57.125
Restrain him!

1:30:59.041 --> 1:31:00.750
You know that boy would never hurt Ffion.

1:31:00.833 --> 1:31:03.125
He has nothing but love
in his heart for her.

1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:08.000
Is this the love of which you speak?

1:31:08.833 --> 1:31:10.583
[Jeremy screaming]

1:31:22.666 --> 1:31:23.875
I, a father...

1:31:26.208 --> 1:31:27.208
robbed of kin,

1:31:29.583 --> 1:31:30.708
even in this,

1:31:31.916 --> 1:31:34.708
-[crunching bone]
-[muffled] a moment of unforgiving grief,

[Jeremy whimpering]

1:31:40.958 --> 1:31:41.916
Am I not?

1:31:44.250 --> 1:31:47.916
-How could you? How could you?
-He shall be cleansed...

1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:48.916
[Andrea] Please!

1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:51.541
...according to the edict of this land.

1:31:51.625 --> 1:31:54.375
[Andrea] Don't let this happen!
Please, don't let this happen!

Let us begin.

1:32:48.958 --> 1:32:50.666
[Jeremy gasping]

1:33:06.916 --> 1:33:08.333
I've wanted this.

1:33:45.208 --> 1:33:46.166
Agh...

1:34:46.083 --> 1:34:47.375
I grant unto thee...

1:34:48.666 --> 1:34:50.333
this symbol of purity.

1:34:53.583 --> 1:34:54.416
Let it guide you.

1:34:58.625 --> 1:35:00.875
[Andrea sobbing]

1:35:06.583 --> 1:35:07.541
Pray for him.

1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:13.166
-[footsteps approaching]
-[Malcolm] Quinn?

1:35:16.708 --> 1:35:17.541

My boy!

1:35:20.416 --> 1:35:21.625
[sobbing] My boy!

1:35:22.916 --> 1:35:23.833
[Quinn] Take him.

1:35:25.625 --> 1:35:26.833
Why?

1:35:27.416 --> 1:35:29.916
Tragedy befalls us both, my friend.

1:35:30.416 --> 1:35:32.208
Your boy took my Ffion.

1:35:32.291 --> 1:35:33.666
No, not my boy!

1:35:33.750 --> 1:35:36.166
-What have you done?
-I have brought justice.

1:35:36.250 --> 1:35:37.708
Give me my boy!

1:35:38.458 --> 1:35:39.291
No.

1:35:40.041 --> 1:35:41.791
No, you have no right.

1:35:42.916 --> 1:35:45.666
-I am still the leader of this land!
-Not anymore!

1:35:46.958 --> 1:35:48.833
This man be a false prophet!

1:35:49.875 --> 1:35:51.000
He is weak.

1:35:51.875 --> 1:35:53.041
We've suffered for it.

1:35:53.125 --> 1:35:55.125
I have faltered, aye.

1:35:56.750 --> 1:35:57.875
And I am repentant.

1:35:58.458 --> 1:36:00.041
We can rebuild anew.

1:36:00.166 --> 1:36:01.416
Ask yourselves...

1:36:02.208 --> 1:36:04.500
who will see us through
these dark days?

1:36:04.583 --> 1:36:08.125
Who will see to it
that this land sustains us?

1:36:08.583 --> 1:36:11.666
Who... will drive a spear

1:36:11.750 --> 1:36:16.125
through the hearts
of those that oppose our god?

1:36:16.458 --> 1:36:18.750
-But at what cost?
-Whatever it takes.

1:36:22.250 --> 1:36:23.625
Prove yourself.

1:36:25.666 --> 1:36:29.000
This man... is the enemy
we have long sought.

1:36:29.583 --> 1:36:31.291
He seeks to destroy...

1:36:32.291 --> 1:36:33.666
our way of life.

1:36:36.375 --> 1:36:37.541
We demand justice!

1:36:39.083 --> 1:36:39.958
Do we not?

1:36:45.458 --> 1:36:47.250
Before the eyes of your child...

1:36:47.958 --> 1:36:49.625
and all that doubt you...

1:36:51.083 --> 1:36:52.458
take this man's life.

Hush, child.

Father, do not mistake this man
as thy enemy.

1:37:27.791 --> 1:37:29.791
Trust me, child, I do not mistake him.

1:37:31.458 --> 1:37:34.583

-As do I of you!

Stay back! This has to end.

Your father can't help you no more, child.

1:51:24.083 --> 1:51:25.166

[Quinn] Years...

1:51:34.166 --> 1:51:36.750
I've sat and watched...

1:51:37.791 --> 1:51:41.208
as those ingrates
gave thanks to your father.

False prophet...

[Quinn] Your father was right about her.

1:54:43.708 --> 1:54:46.916
You put a god between your enemy
and the people,

1:54:47.666 --> 1:54:51.333
put the word of the Almighty
between the crosshairs of their muskets,

1:54:51.416 --> 1:54:52.541
you'll see!

1:54:53.291 --> 1:54:56.708

But she's no god.

1:55:13.333 --> 1:55:14.458
She's just a machine.

1:55:15.875 --> 1:55:16.916
You feed her...

1:55:17.458 --> 1:55:18.291
and she...

1:55:19.916 --> 1:55:20.750
delivers.

Malcolm...

1:55:32.166 --> 1:55:33.250

When the blood of the animals
stopped working...

1:55:41.166 --> 1:55:42.541
he tried to feed her himself.

1:55:43.833 --> 1:55:44.666
Hm?

1:55:46.416 --> 1:55:48.333
He fell victim... to faith.

1:55:51.750 --> 1:55:53.375
He would have let us all starve.

1:55:55.166 --> 1:55:57.166
Instead of doing what needed to be done.

1:55:57.666 --> 1:56:00.541
Instead of feeding her
what she needed to be fed.

1:56:13.416 --> 1:56:14.291
Look above you.

1:56:16.833 --> 1:56:18.083
That will be your sun...

your cloud...

1:56:21.291 --> 1:56:22.333
your moon...

your only way of knowing
that a day has passed.

1:56:27.875 --> 1:56:28.791
And many will.

1:56:33.125 --> 1:56:34.708
For I will save this village.

1:56:37.416 --> 1:56:38.291
You...

1:56:41.125 --> 1:56:42.625

1:56:45.291 --> 1:56:46.583
And when it is ripened...

1:56:47.833 --> 1:56:49.083
I will feed her...

1:56:49.916 --> 1:56:52.333
the flesh of your womb.

1:56:53.375 --> 1:56:54.375
And every year...

You have to. Look at me, Jen.

and you never will.

This world... has taken so much from me.

But in all my pain,
even in my darkest days,

2:01:11.666 --> 2:01:15.416
I swore...
I swore it would never take you.

Now go, get on that boat,

that guides me to eternity.
