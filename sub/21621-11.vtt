WEBVTT

00:05.639 --> 00:09.643
-Are you ready? Taking no Ls.
-Murda, Murda, Murda.

00:25.225 --> 00:27.628
Don't call me t... TMurda

00:28.095 --> 00:30.731
-Wait, hold on, one more time.
-I couldn't even do the...

00:39.540 --> 00:41.975
I have a couple of warm ups that I do.

00:49.316 --> 00:50.817
-Are you vibrating?
-I'm feeling that.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.719
OK, good. Wake the face up.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.688
-Wake it up.
-Just to get that juice flowing.

00:54.755 --> 00:57.157
-You meditate, right?
-I do.

00:57.224 --> 00:58.125
Alright, peace.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.407
-Are you ready?
-I'm ready.

01:15.876 --> 01:17.077
Yeah.

01:17.544 --> 01:18.679
Yeah.

01:20.848 --> 01:23.050
Her back move
and she made her t****** move.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.085
I'm gonna have to work on that.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.689
Why did you pull your phone out?

01:28.755 --> 01:33.093
Sean, listen. This is high level stuff.
This is not low level rapping.

01:33.160 --> 01:33.827
You're right.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.597
OK.

01:36.663 --> 01:38.198
OK.

02:18.705 --> 02:20.073
It's impossible.

02:37.991 --> 02:42.362
I'm from Detroit. I went to
the same high school as your mom.

02:42.429 --> 02:43.730
-Cass Tech?
-Cass Tech.

02:43.797 --> 02:47.434
-Shut up!
-CT, yeah. So, like, your mom...

02:47.835 --> 02:51.839
...is a legend to the whole world,
but especially in Detroit.

02:52.739 --> 02:56.643
What is it like, first of all,
to have your mom be Diana Ross?

02:56.710 --> 03:00.013
I knew my mom had a different job
than most of my friends

03:00.047 --> 03:03.417
because, when my mom went to her work,

03:03.483 --> 03:05.919
it's in a stadium with people
screaming her name

03:06.053 --> 03:08.488
and that was not the most normal thing.

03:08.555 --> 03:11.725
-Right.
-But she is a mom before she's Diana Ross.

03:11.792 --> 03:16.830
I grew up and one of my favourite things
is watching my mom perform.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.650
You even sing the way you rap.

04:09.216 --> 04:11.351
You sound good. G******.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.733
You killed that. G******.

04:26.800 --> 04:30.504
-That's a good karaoke song.
-You sing it like Diana Ross is your mom.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.406
Oh, my God.

04:36.677 --> 04:41.114
-How did you get into acting?
-I was really shy growing up and...

04:41.181 --> 04:44.551
-Really?
-I was. But I like to make people laugh.

04:44.618 --> 04:49.723
In college, I took an acting class
and I just lit up.

04:49.790 --> 04:53.427
You know, Tracee,
I dabble in a little acting.

04:53.493 --> 04:56.330
-I've done Shakespeare plays before.
-Shut up!

04:56.396 --> 04:59.733
-I did The Tempest, played the prince.
-OK. That's...

04:59.800 --> 05:01.201
-Murdered.
-You murdered it?

05:02.035 --> 05:03.303
I don't know, I was in 8th grade.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.140
Obviously, music is my first passion.

05:07.207 --> 05:10.511
-But acting is a serious thing because...
-Oh, this is exciting.

05:10.577 --> 05:12.145
Watch out, world, here he comes.

05:12.212 --> 05:15.315
-Because that's rapping: telling stories.
-That's true.

05:15.382 --> 05:19.319
It's not too many degrees of separation
between the two.

05:19.386 --> 05:22.756
You wanting to lean into the acting world,

05:22.823 --> 05:28.262
I felt like we should do something
that crosses over into both worlds.

05:28.328 --> 05:32.499
We could take rap lyrics
from songs that exist and...

05:34.368 --> 05:35.302
...act them.

05:35.369 --> 05:36.170
OK.

05:36.803 --> 05:39.806
I've pulled a couple of songs
and printed them out.

05:39.873 --> 05:40.874
That's my song.

05:42.242 --> 05:44.578
-That might be fun.
-Let's try it.

05:44.645 --> 05:45.779
As a breakup scene.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.651
Wobbledy, wobbledy, wobbledy,
wobble, wobble, wobble!

05:51.318 --> 05:54.087
I'm stacking my paper,
my wallet look like a Bible

05:54.121 --> 05:57.958
I got girlies half naked
and that s*** look like the grotto

05:58.091 --> 05:59.960
Stop! Drop it! Drop it!

06:01.128 --> 06:04.765
You got everybody in here oh, my goshing

06:04.831 --> 06:06.633
Your whole crew look like a pageant

06:06.700 --> 06:10.337
I'm dropping cash, tip, and some taxes
Whoop!

06:11.104 --> 06:14.141
Girl, you got me about to pass out

06:14.208 --> 06:17.778
Because I'm in love with that,
I'm in love with that...

06:17.845 --> 06:21.048
...ass, ass, ass, ass, ass.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.718
-And...
-...scene.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.487
-That was so good.
-That was good.

06:27.554 --> 06:31.058
Let's get another song and go outside.
We should give this to the public.

06:31.692 --> 06:32.626
Alright.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.929
-Ready? Do you have your book?
-Yeah.

06:36.063 --> 06:39.132
-Are you gonna be OK with these heels?
-No, it's gonna be awful.

06:39.199 --> 06:43.170
Doing a small performance here,
rap turns serious.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.838
Please feel free to join us.

06:46.240 --> 06:50.110
What's our motivation on this if we could
have a suggestion from the crowd?

06:58.585 --> 07:02.289
I like big butts and I cannot lie

07:03.423 --> 07:07.261
You other brothers, you can't deny

07:07.628 --> 07:09.763
-That when a girl walks in...
-Yeah

07:11.064 --> 07:13.400
-...with an itty bitty waist...
-Like a small one?

07:13.467 --> 07:16.570
-...and a round thing in your face.
-Oh, you get so sprung.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.108
Scene.

07:24.311 --> 07:26.246
Big Sean!

07:26.313 --> 07:27.881
What's up?

07:28.482 --> 07:30.017
-What's up?
-What's up?

07:30.050 --> 07:32.252
-Sorry to bother you.
-Bye!

07:34.621 --> 07:35.956
OK, what's next?

07:42.429 --> 07:47.167
O is for other, P is for people's
scratch your temple

07:49.069 --> 07:51.538
The last P, well, that's not simple

07:52.606 --> 07:55.542
-You down with O.P.P.?
-Yeah, you know me

07:56.109 --> 07:57.511
And, scene.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.848
Thanks, everybody who was in attendance,
it's a true honour.

08:00.914 --> 08:05.619
Golden Globe recipient Tracee Ellis Ross,
clap it up for her, everybody.

08:07.921 --> 08:10.457
-I think that went really well.
-Thank you.

08:10.524 --> 08:14.161
-I mean come on. So let's do your song.
-I like that.

08:21.735 --> 08:23.637
You would never hear me say that.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.141
Why are you so angry?

08:41.621 --> 08:55.769
-I do sound real mad on here.
-You sound so mad.

08:55.802 --> 08:58.672
That’s messed up. That was so sad.

08:58.739 --> 09:01.475
I was given the challenge and I failed.
I L’d it.

09:09.016 --> 09:11.818
What's up, how you doing?
Nice to see you. Hello.

09:11.885 --> 09:15.489
Big Sean in the car.
Little Big Sean in the car.

09:20.027 --> 09:23.096
Oh my God, they're having a party.
Did you smell that?

09:24.064 --> 09:26.066
I shouldn't have rolled the window down!

09:29.670 --> 09:33.607
So clearly there are a lot of things
you don't f*** with.

09:33.674 --> 09:38.378
-And one is a stupid b****.
-Yeah, I don't f*** with stupid b******.

09:38.445 --> 09:41.548
-I don't f*** with stupid b****** either.
-I don't think anybody should.

09:41.615 --> 09:44.251
I don't f*** with a stupid dude.
No one should...

09:44.318 --> 09:47.054
Hold on, don't get it twisted,
a b**** could be a dude too.

09:48.222 --> 09:50.557
A woman's a woman, a lady's a lady.

09:51.491 --> 09:54.728
-A man's a man and a b**** is a b****.
-This is such a lesson.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.196
It's a hundred per cent facts.

09:56.263 --> 10:00.167
So in line with
what you don't f*** with...

10:00.234 --> 10:02.135
...I thought we could play a little game.

10:02.202 --> 10:05.706
About what you do f*** with.
So I have some questions.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.708
If I don't f*** with her, I say I don't...

10:07.774 --> 10:10.777
I don't f*** with and whatever it is.

10:10.844 --> 10:14.715
And then if you f*** with it,
you can say, yeah, I f*** with that.

10:14.781 --> 10:19.119
Man buns. So man's hair in a bun.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.989
I don't f*** with man buns.

10:24.091 --> 10:25.659
Male Spanx?

10:28.495 --> 10:32.699
I don't f*** with Spanx.
Male Spanx, how does that work?

10:32.766 --> 10:35.769
-I know a lot of men that wear male Spanx.
-Really?

10:38.372 --> 10:40.007
Do you f*** with nose rings?

10:41.341 --> 10:43.110
I f*** with nose rings.

10:43.177 --> 10:48.415
-Do you f*** with farmer's markets?
-Who wouldn't f*** farmer's market?

10:48.482 --> 10:50.517
Let me tell you who doesn't
f*** with farmer's markets.

10:50.584 --> 10:52.452
-Who?
-Stupid b******.

10:52.519 --> 10:53.554
OK, there you go.

10:55.889 --> 10:59.459
How did you get into rapping?
I have no idea.

10:59.526 --> 11:05.666
-I'm sure the world wants to know.
-I have a rap name of TMurda.

11:05.732 --> 11:10.804
TMurda. That's on fire.
Tell me how you came up with TMurda.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.740
I didn't. I was named TMurda.

11:13.807 --> 11:16.276
That's savage,
that's how murderous it gets.

11:16.343 --> 11:20.914
It was so murderous, but I feel like
TMurda is the raw version of me.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.317
-Can TMurda come to the studio?
-Don't f*** with me.

11:23.383 --> 11:26.086
-No, I'm for real. Are you ready?
-I wanna go to the studio.

11:26.420 --> 11:31.225
-We gonna play around in there.
-TMurda is going to the studio

11:31.291 --> 11:32.125
Yeah, with me.

11:34.428 --> 11:35.696
-Ready?
-I got this.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.901
-No way!
-This is a real studio.

11:41.835 --> 11:45.339
OK, hold on.
In the hopes I wrote something.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.874
Why not? Of course.

11:46.940 --> 11:50.944
You look at this and in the meantime,
I'm gonna transform into TMurda.

11:51.011 --> 11:54.481
Got them grills, going crazy.
TMurda on the grills, that's...

11:54.548 --> 11:58.452
-In rubies.
-I know. You ready? Taking no Ls.

11:58.519 --> 12:02.856
Taking no Ls.
Murda, Murda, Murda, taking no Ls.

12:28.182 --> 12:30.851
-Don't call me Tracee, it's TMurda
-Go off.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.654
Rhymes like a subpoena
'bout to serve ya

12:33.720 --> 12:36.623
Big Sean raise the bar
I raise it further

12:36.690 --> 12:38.992
Spitting verses,
ears they never heard of

12:39.092 --> 12:40.961
But I'm keeping it PG
because I'm an aunt

12:41.094 --> 12:44.131
You know me as an actress first
with Girlfriends, now I'm Black-ish

12:44.198 --> 12:46.867
I see you eyeing my fashion,
it's Zuhair Murad, thanks for asking

12:46.934 --> 12:49.636
My smile's big, that's my passion,
natural hair big so it matches

12:49.703 --> 12:52.606
Haters, no, no distractions,
got that Golden Globe winner status

12:52.673 --> 12:54.241
Give me glass ceilings
I'mma break through

12:54.308 --> 12:55.709
Get them so ill like a bird flu

12:55.843 --> 12:58.712
It's past time that y'all knew
I'm not that lady from the tube

12:58.779 --> 13:01.548
Got truth problems like precautions,
my inhibitions, I squashed them

13:01.615 --> 13:05.219
Feminists like boss, hon
My mom is Diana Ross, son

13:07.554 --> 13:09.756
Carpool Karaoke, we won that s***!
