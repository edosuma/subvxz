10:34.258 --> 10:36.010
CAUGHT HER
COMMITTING A 326--

10:36.093 --> 10:39.138
{\an5}WILLFUL RESIDENTIAL
VANDALISM INVOLVING
A HACKSAW

10:39.221 --> 10:41.223
{\an1}SLEDGEHAMMER OR
TWO-PLY TOILET TISSUE.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.641
{\an1}ORDINARILY,
I'D TAKE HER IN

10:42.725 --> 10:45.895
{\an1}BUT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO DEAL WITH IT.

10:45.978 --> 10:49.023
OF ALL THE KIDS TO GO OUT
ON MISCHIEF NIGHT.

10:49.106 --> 10:51.233
I TURN MY BACK FOR ONE SECOND...

10:51.317 --> 10:52.485
BUT, DAD...

10:52.568 --> 10:54.111
SHE'S TAKING
THE HEAT FOR US--

10:54.195 --> 10:55.571
WAY TO GO, REG.

10:55.654 --> 10:56.906
SHE'LL GET
IN TROUBLE

10:56.989 --> 10:58.240
FOR SOMETHING
SHE DIDN'T DO.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.034
{\an1}I THINK YOU
CAN HANDLE IT, RAY.

11:00.117 --> 11:02.078
THANKS, SHIRL.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.457
{\an1}WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO SAY FOR YOURSELF?

11:06.540 --> 11:07.166
Otto:
SHE DIDN'T DO IT!

11:07.249 --> 11:09.418
WE SNUCK OUT.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.046
SHE WAS JUST TRYING
TO GET US TO COME BACK.

11:12.129 --> 11:14.757
{\an5}SO I GUESS WE'RE GOING
TO MISS HALLOWEEN?

11:14.840 --> 11:16.300
OH...

11:16.384 --> 11:18.677
I HAVE SOMETHING WORSE--
MUCH WORSE.

11:26.602 --> 11:28.312
(<i> doorbell rings</i> )

11:28.396 --> 11:30.398
WELL, YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN.

11:30.481 --> 11:34.568
YOUR FAMILY THEME COSTUMES GET
CUTER AND CUTER EVERY YEAR.

11:34.652 --> 11:35.152
WHO WANTS CANDY?

11:35.236 --> 11:38.072
All:
I DO, I DO!

11:38.155 --> 11:39.907
NOW, VIOLET

11:39.990 --> 11:42.618
THIS YEAR WE HAVE
A NEW TRICK-OR-TREATING RULE:

11:42.701 --> 11:45.037
ONLY ONE PIECE OF CANDY
PER HOUSE.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.706
Kids:
NO!

11:47.790 --> 11:50.793

(<i> wrench ratcheting</i> )

12:10.396 --> 12:12.481
UH-HUH, COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON.

12:12.565 --> 12:13.566
LET'S GO, COME ON.

12:13.649 --> 12:15.651
{\an1}I HATE TO DROP
SOME MAJOR BUMMAGE

12:15.734 --> 12:18.112
{\an4}BUT THIS IS
NOT A FINELY
TUNED MACHINE.

12:18.195 --> 12:19.697
THEN TUNE IT.

12:19.780 --> 12:23.159
THIS IS THE YEAR I'M GOING
TO FINALLY BEAT MY BROTHER.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.964
(<i> crashing next door</i> )

12:37.047 --> 12:38.215
(<i> gasps</i> )

12:38.299 --> 12:41.135
HOW'S ANYONE SUPPOSED
TO ENJOY THE MORNING

12:41.218 --> 12:43.137
WITH THAT INSUFFERABLE
COMMOTION NEXT DOOR?

12:43.220 --> 12:45.473
{\an1}HERE YOU GO,
MERV...

12:45.556 --> 12:46.932
OATMEAL A LA KING.

12:47.016 --> 12:51.479
OH, SWEET HOLY FIBER,
DO YOUR DUTY.

12:51.562 --> 12:52.229
HMM...

12:52.313 --> 12:54.857
(<i> hammering</i> )

12:54.940 --> 12:56.442
(<i> yelling</i> )

12:58.944 --> 13:00.154

13:02.698 --> 13:03.824

13:03.908 --> 13:06.160
COME ON, YOU
GUYS, CAREFUL

13:06.243 --> 13:08.120
WITH THE SPEED
MACHINE.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.371
{\an1}"SPEED MACHINE"?
OH, PLEASE.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.916
WHEN I WIN THE TROPHY

13:11.999 --> 13:14.835
{\an1}MY NIGHTMARE BROTHER'S
GOING TO FLIP.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.421
WAKE UP, THE NIGHTMARE'S HERE.

13:20.966 --> 13:21.884
(<i> tires squealing</i> )

13:23.802 --> 13:26.388
{\an1}OH, MAN, LOOK AT
THAT HUNK OF JUNK.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.556
THIS IS
THE SPEED MACHINE

13:27.640 --> 13:30.392
YOU'VE BEEN
BRAGGING ABOUT?

13:30.476 --> 13:32.436
(<i> muttering</i> )

13:35.981 --> 13:37.733
(<i> groaning</i> )

13:37.816 --> 13:41.237
WE'LL SEE WHO'S BRAGGING
AT THE FINISH LINE, LARS.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.572
IF YOU MAKE IT
TO THE FINISH LINE.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.242
YOU MIGHT BE IN
FOR QUITE A SURPRISE.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.244
OH, YOU THINK SO?

13:48.327 --> 13:49.245
NOT REALLY.

13:49.328 --> 13:52.456
WE <i> KNOW</i> SO.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.750
COME RACE TIME,
YOU'RE GOING TO BE

13:54.833 --> 13:56.418
A BUNCH OF SORRY LOSERS.

13:56.502 --> 13:57.586
{\an1}TOO LATE.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.256
HEY, WHY WAIT
UNTIL THE STREET FAIR?

14:00.339 --> 14:01.173
LET'S RACE RIGHT NOW.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.759
YEAH, WHY NOT?

14:03.842 --> 14:04.176
{\an1}ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ENOUGH

14:04.260 --> 14:06.512
YOU LOLLYGAGGERS.

14:06.595 --> 14:09.640
TAKE YOUR CACOPHONOUS LOITERING
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

14:09.723 --> 14:11.058
I WOULD SUGGEST ANOTHER STATE.

14:12.601 --> 14:15.980
SEA FOAM STREET,
FIVE MINUTES.

14:16.063 --> 14:20.776
GET READY TO EAT MY DUST,
YOU LITTLE DORK.

14:20.859 --> 14:21.235
I'M NOT LITTLE.

14:21.318 --> 14:23.445
"EAT MY DUST"?

14:23.529 --> 14:25.489
WE'LL GIVE HIM
A FOUR-COURSE MEAL.

14:25.573 --> 14:28.534
(<i> grunting from exertion</i> )

14:29.535 --> 14:30.703
I HAVE A QUESTION.

14:30.786 --> 14:32.705
IF OUR GO-CART IS
A SPEED MACHINE

14:32.788 --> 14:35.916
WHY ARE WE CARRYING IT
TO THE STREET?

14:40.170 --> 14:42.423
WHAT?!

14:46.176 --> 14:47.094
NOW, REMEMBER

14:47.177 --> 14:49.388
{\an1}LARS HAS BEEN KNOWN
TO RACE DIRTY

14:49.471 --> 14:50.639
{\an1}SO KEEP
YOUR DISTANCE.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.474
KEEP YOUR HANDS
ON THE WHEEL.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.810
LOOK BOTH WAYS BEFORE
CROSSING THE STREET...

14:54.893 --> 14:57.354
AND ABOVE ALL, CONCENTRATE.

14:58.355 --> 15:00.399
HEY, LOOK, I CAN BLOW BUBBLES
WITH MY TONGUE.

15:00.482 --> 15:03.485
(<i> groans</i> )

15:03.569 --> 15:04.278
(<i> garbled</i> ):
ON YOUR MARK...

15:04.361 --> 15:06.655
GET SET... GO.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.538
(<i> tires screech</i> )

15:15.456 --> 15:18.000
NO, NO, NO!

15:19.251 --> 15:20.002
(<i> screaming</i> )

15:26.258 --> 15:27.468
(<i> crashing</i> )

15:27.551 --> 15:30.012
{\an5}Merv:
FOR THE LOVE
OF MIKE...!

15:30.095 --> 15:32.139
{\an5}THAT WASN'T WHO
I THOUGHT IT
WAS, WAS IT?

15:32.222 --> 15:34.099
SOUNDED LIKE MR. STIMPLETON.

15:34.183 --> 15:34.933
{\an1}WHAT?!

15:42.608 --> 15:46.779
LET ME HANDLE
THIS, OKAY?

15:46.862 --> 15:46.987
PHEW!

15:52.117 --> 15:53.118
(<i> moaning</i> )

15:53.202 --> 15:54.411
SORRY, MR. STIMPLETON.

15:54.495 --> 15:55.871
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE!

15:55.954 --> 15:58.040
VIOLET'S PRIZED
AFRICAN VIOLETS.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.375
WE'RE SORRY, MR. STIMPLETON.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.001
WE PROMISE, WE'LL DO
OUR GO-CARTING

16:01.085 --> 16:02.503
FURTHER DOWN THE HILL NEXT TIME.

16:02.586 --> 16:04.046
{\an1}WE'RE GOING
TO MAKE EVERYTHING

16:04.129 --> 16:06.382
AS GOOD AS NEW.

16:08.884 --> 16:09.927
{\an3}SEE?

16:10.803 --> 16:11.679
{\an3}OOH.

16:11.762 --> 16:12.346
AND NO ONE WAS HURT, SIR.

16:12.429 --> 16:14.431
YOU HAVE TO AGREE

16:14.515 --> 16:16.684
THAT THAT'S WHAT IS
MOST IMPORTANT HERE.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.894
NO ONE WAS HURT <i> YET.</i>

16:18.977 --> 16:21.897
I BET MRS. STIMPLETON
WON'T EVEN NOTICE.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.440
{\an1}Violet:
HELLO, THERE, KIDS.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.943

VIOLET, ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT, DEAR?

16:50.843 --> 16:53.554
(<i> whimpering</i> )

16:53.637 --> 16:55.848
{\an1}WILL YOU EXCUSE
ME, PLEASE?

16:55.931 --> 17:01.145
{\an1}I MUST RE-ALPHABETIZE
THE SPICE RACK.

17:02.521 --> 17:06.483
HONEY... VIOLET...
POOKIE-WOOKIE FACE?

17:06.567 --> 17:08.944
THAT WAS EASIER THAN I THOUGHT.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.487
NOW, WHERE'S THAT WHEEL?

17:10.570 --> 17:11.155
{\an1}HELLO?

17:11.238 --> 17:13.949
{\an1}DIDN'T YOU SEE
MRS. STIMPLETON?

17:14.031 --> 17:16.326
WHAT? DID SHE GET A HAIRCUT?

17:22.332 --> 17:25.752
MRS. STIMPLETON'S NORMALLY
BOPPING AROUND THE YARD BY NOW.

17:25.836 --> 17:26.712
I'M WORRIED.

17:26.795 --> 17:27.628
MRS. STIMPLETON'S FINE.

17:27.713 --> 17:30.507

17:34.553 --> 17:36.430
{\an4}Merv:
BUT, POOKIE,

IF YOU SAY SO.

17:37.598 --> 17:40.225
{\an5}OH, YEAH, TOTALLY FINE.

COME ON, OTTO.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.649
GOOD MORNING,

17:47.733 --> 17:48.650
{\an1}IT IS?

17:48.734 --> 17:50.944
NOW, VIOLET,
WHY DON'T YOU GO

17:51.028 --> 17:52.905
WORK ON YOUR
HERB GARDEN?

17:52.988 --> 17:54.490
WHAT'S THE POINT, MERV?

17:54.573 --> 17:57.451
{\an1}SOON ANOTHER WHEEL WILL
WIPE OUT MY CILANTRO.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.330
{\an1}IS SHE OKAY,
MR. STIMPLETON?

18:01.413 --> 18:02.539
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

18:02.623 --> 18:04.166
IT WAS ONLY A FLOWER.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.126
ONLY A FLOWER!

18:06.210 --> 18:08.128
OTTO, REGGIE, FOLLOW ME.

18:08.212 --> 18:11.840
THERE'S SOMETHING YOU SHOULD
KNOW ABOUT MY SNOOKUMS.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.051
VIOLET IS
A SIMPLE WOMAN

18:14.134 --> 18:16.804
WHO HAS BUT ONE
JOY IN LIFE.

18:17.763 --> 18:18.597
{\an3}WHOA!

18:18.680 --> 18:19.598
{\an1}COOL.

18:20.599 --> 18:21.225
YOU SEE...

18:21.308 --> 18:23.852
IT'S NOT ABOUT A LITTLE FLOWER.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.979
IT'S ABOUT MY LADY'S LEGACY.

18:26.063 --> 18:27.189
(<i> Violet gasps</i> )

18:27.272 --> 18:28.524
EVERY YEAR FOR 30 YEARS

18:28.607 --> 18:30.818
MY AFRICAN VIOLETS
HAVE TAKEN FIRST PLACE

18:30.901 --> 18:32.277
AT THE OCEAN FEST.

18:32.361 --> 18:37.574
NOW THERE'S NO ENTRY, AND A SPOT
ON THE RACK WILL BE EMPTY.

18:37.658 --> 18:38.367
{\an1}THE CILANTRO,
DEAR.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.244
OF COURSE.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.664
MUST TEND TO
THE CILANTRO.

18:43.747 --> 18:46.166
WE FEEL AWFUL,
MR. STIMPLETON.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.709
WELL, YOU SHOULD!

18:47.793 --> 18:48.544
{\an1}MAN, 30 YEARS
IN A ROW

18:48.627 --> 18:49.878
AND WE RUINED IT.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.882
THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMETHING WE CAN DO.

18:56.593 --> 18:57.678
ANOTHER TROPHY...

18:57.761 --> 19:01.890
THE DOWNHILL
GO-CART RACE!

19:01.974 --> 19:03.100
MY VIOLET IS
IN NO CONDITION

19:03.183 --> 19:07.521
{\an5}TO ENTER
A NO-HOLDS-BARRED
DOWNHILL DONNYBROOK.

19:07.604 --> 19:09.565
NO, BUT WE ARE,
AND IF WE WIN

19:09.648 --> 19:12.025
THERE'LL BE A TROPHY
FOR THAT SPOT THIS YEAR.

19:12.109 --> 19:15.863
FOR THE LOVE OF VIOLET,
WE'VE GOT TO WIN.

19:15.946 --> 19:19.992
{\an1}EARTH TO REGGIE,
THE GO-CART'S TOAST.

19:20.075 --> 19:20.868
HANG ON, I CAN HELP.

19:20.951 --> 19:24.538
IF IT'S GOT WHEELS ON IT,
BY GUM

19:24.621 --> 19:27.165
THIS MAN CAN MAKE IT GO.

19:34.756 --> 19:37.593
I FLUSHED THE RADIATOR.

19:37.676 --> 19:40.387
THAT'S NOT THE GO-CART;
THAT'S MY CAR.

19:42.472 --> 19:44.474
NOW, CHECK THE FILTERS.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.895
I'M ALL DONE WITH
THE SANDING, SIR.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.856
NOT BAD, ROCKET.

19:50.939 --> 19:51.815
REGGIE?

19:51.899 --> 19:54.109
{\an1}READY FOR
INSPECTION, SIR.

19:57.779 --> 19:59.448
NICELY BALANCED.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.199
{\an1}AND I ROTATED
THE TIRES.

20:01.283 --> 20:02.284
I LIKE THAT INITIATIVE.

20:02.367 --> 20:06.622
I'D SAY YOU HOOLIGANS DID
A BANG-UP JOB, BY CRACKY.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.665
All:
ALL RIGHT!

20:08.749 --> 20:10.459
IT'LL TAKE MORE
THAN JUST A CAR

20:10.542 --> 20:11.460
TO WIN THAT RACE.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.045
I'LL GIVE IT
EVERYTHING I GOT.

20:13.128 --> 20:17.674
NOW THERE'S JUST
ONE THING LEFT TO DO.

20:19.426 --> 20:20.802
{\an1}Violet:
I DON'T WANT TO BE

20:20.886 --> 20:21.845
HERE AT OCEAN FEST.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.055
IT'S TOO PAINFUL TO KNOW

20:23.138 --> 20:23.764
I WON'T BE GOING HOME
WITH A TROPHY.

20:23.847 --> 20:25.891
{\an1}JUST HOLD IT
TOGETHER.

20:25.974 --> 20:28.060
{\an1}I THINK YOU'RE
GOING TO LIKE THIS.

20:28.143 --> 20:30.979
YEAH, WE HAVE A SURPRISE.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.814
WHAT IS THIS?

20:36.234 --> 20:39.154
SINCE YOU CAN'T WIN
A VIOLET TROPHY THIS YEAR

20:39.237 --> 20:41.490
WE'RE GOING TO TRY
TO WIN YOU ANOTHER TROPHY.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.825
OH, FOR THE LOVE OF ME.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.327
SHE'S SURE A BEAUTY.

20:45.410 --> 20:49.623
NOW, YOU COME HERE,
YOU SCRUMPTIOUS LITTLE...

20:49.706 --> 20:52.376
Racers to your go-carts.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.920
BE CAREFUL,
LITTLE MAURICE.

20:55.003 --> 20:56.421
YEAH, LITTLE MAURICE.

20:56.505 --> 20:57.673
YOU BETTER BE
CAREFUL NOT TO WIN

OR THERE'S
GOING TO BE

21:00.092 --> 21:01.760
A WHOMPING
IN YOUR FUTURE.

21:01.843 --> 21:03.887
THERE'S ALWAYS A WHOMPING
IN MY FUTURE.

21:48.932 --> 21:51.309
YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO WIN!

21:52.144 --> 21:55.230
AND YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE A DORK.

21:55.313 --> 21:57.357
{\an1}SOMETIMES LIFE
AIN'T FAIR.

22:00.485 --> 22:03.905
MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE
