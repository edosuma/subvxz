00:15.416 --> 00:16.849
Hello, you've reached
melody's phone.

00:16.851 --> 00:18.150
Don't bother leaving a message

00:18.152 --> 00:20.419
because I probably
won't listen to it.

00:20.421 --> 00:25.124
You have 112 new messages.

00:25.126 --> 00:29.862
Melody, it's Tommy,
you know, your landlord.

00:29.864 --> 00:31.030
I know that times are hard,

00:31.032 --> 00:32.965
but you need to pay that rent.

00:32.967 --> 00:35.868
Melody, it's 12.30.

00:35.870 --> 00:38.137
I've sent you another message
about your expenses!

00:38.139 --> 00:42.708
Hi melody, this is candy
from RVSR US,

00:42.710 --> 00:45.344
and we've got your RV
all ready for burning man.

00:46.347 --> 00:48.747
Melody, it's Sam.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.482
Don't forget dinner tonight.

00:50.484 --> 00:53.452
I'm sure you're looking
forward to it as much as I am.

00:53.454 --> 00:56.455
Can you just tell your teenager

00:56.457 --> 00:58.824
not to make things too weird.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.159
Ta.

01:00.494 --> 01:02.961
London is going through

01:02.963 --> 01:04.663
the greatest property boom
in history,

01:04.665 --> 01:06.999
and I'm missing it
because of you.

01:07.001 --> 01:11.136
Tommy is pretty pissed off
about the rent, Mel.

01:11.138 --> 01:12.638
He said if you don't pay it

01:12.640 --> 01:15.074
he's gonna come back
to London on air miles

01:15.076 --> 01:17.176
and garrote you
with dental floss.

01:17.944 --> 01:19.845
I'm not sure
that's even possible,

01:19.847 --> 01:21.380
but if he's willing
to use up his air miles

01:21.382 --> 01:22.748
he must be really fucked off.

01:22.750 --> 01:26.118
Melody, it's David Klein here.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.187
I would very much like
to meet you for lunch.

01:28.521 --> 01:31.190
Shall we say the at two o'clock?

02:13.367 --> 02:15.501
You must think
I'm such an idiot.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.202
I don't understand any of that.

02:17.204 --> 02:18.637
I wouldn't say you're an idiot.

02:18.639 --> 02:22.074
Oh. Well, maybe it's just
too much champagne.

02:22.076 --> 02:23.775
It's really very simple.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.611
Our new product is a medicine

02:25.613 --> 02:28.614
based around a chemical
compound called Vincyclidine.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.449
Going to make us pots of money.

02:32.753 --> 02:35.888
- Excuse me, miss Munro?
- Yes?

02:35.890 --> 02:37.789
A telephone call for you
at the bar.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.658
Oh, how old school.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.627
I'm so sorry,
will you excuse me?

02:41.629 --> 02:43.328
- I'll be right here.
- Okay.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.763
Don't go anywhere.

02:50.203 --> 02:51.370
Melody Munro.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.672
£5,000 on a Winnebago rental?

02:53.674 --> 02:55.107
Perhaps you could tell me
how your work demands

02:55.109 --> 02:57.042
any need
for a luxury motor-home?

02:57.044 --> 03:00.479
Excuse me, sorry.
What desserts do you recommend?

03:00.481 --> 03:01.880
The soufflé's very popular,

03:01.882 --> 03:03.916
but, personally, I recommend
the pear tart.

03:03.918 --> 03:05.117
Hm. We'll have two of those.

03:05.119 --> 03:07.986
Oh, and the bill.
My guest will be leaving soon.

03:08.121 --> 03:10.422
Alan, Alan, stop talking.

03:10.424 --> 03:13.292
I've just sent you the
recording of our conversation

03:13.294 --> 03:14.960
and my write-up.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.128
I'll be back in three weeks
after my holiday.

03:16.130 --> 03:18.830
No, you will not, you will
be in my office in...

03:22.602 --> 03:24.236
how the hell did she...

03:25.538 --> 03:27.673
Fuckin' badass, tell you that.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.243
Thank you, Barry.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.713
I'm so sorry about that.

03:34.715 --> 03:38.550
So, what do you say
we get these to go?

03:39.552 --> 03:41.820
I know a very good
and very discreet hotel

03:41.822 --> 03:43.388
'round the corner.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.325
Oh, David,
that sounds wonderful,

03:46.327 --> 03:48.760
but I've got things to do.
Sorry.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.963
Come on, sack that off!

03:50.965 --> 03:53.699
I'm not buying you lunch so you can
go back to emails and photocopying.

03:55.069 --> 03:58.036
Yeah, I don't really do
photocopying in my work, David.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.671
'Course, I'm sorry.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.741
I'm sure your role
is very important.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.576
Yeah.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.412
I work
in competitive intelligence.

04:09.015 --> 04:10.482
You're a corporate spy?

04:10.484 --> 04:11.783
Oh, actually we're trying
to get away

04:11.785 --> 04:13.952
from the whole spy thing.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.822
But what I've just told you,
it's commercially sensitive!

04:16.824 --> 04:19.257
It's-it's completely secret!

04:19.260 --> 04:24.196
Sensitive, yes.
Secret, not so much anymore.

04:28.234 --> 04:30.068
Oh, wow,

04:30.070 --> 04:32.337
this has been
an expensive lunch!

04:32.339 --> 04:34.039
You whore!

04:34.707 --> 04:36.074
No, David...

04:37.277 --> 04:39.044
that's what you thought I was.

04:39.046 --> 04:42.514
I am fucking you,
just not how you imagined.

04:55.628 --> 04:58.030
So there's 100 pills,
your two ounces of Charlie,

04:58.032 --> 04:59.631
two bottles of liquid ketamine,

04:59.633 --> 05:02.501
and my own special mish-mash,
2ci, 2cb, m-cat

05:02.503 --> 05:04.036
and a couple of others
that haven't come out yet.

05:04.038 --> 05:05.304
Will that do you?

05:10.209 --> 05:12.077
- Alan?
- I've found another one!

05:12.079 --> 05:17.649
£2,347 on flowers, in may!

05:18.418 --> 05:19.985
People like flowers, Alan.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.656
If you like my flat so much,

05:24.658 --> 05:27.292
maybe you could find it
in your barren heart

05:27.294 --> 05:28.560
to pay me some fucking rent.

05:28.562 --> 05:29.995
Listen, I've done more
for this flat

05:29.997 --> 05:31.296
than you've ever done.

05:31.298 --> 05:32.497
That's probably true, but...

05:32.499 --> 05:34.132
I also own it so...

05:34.134 --> 05:37.369
unless we enter a state
of pure utopian Marxism

05:37.371 --> 05:39.638
in the next 24 hours...

05:39.640 --> 05:42.574
you pay me some rent,
or you get the fuck out.

05:42.875 --> 05:44.076
Goodbye.

05:49.549 --> 05:50.882
He doesn't mean it.

05:59.459 --> 06:00.992
It's amazing!

06:02.896 --> 06:03.929
You've got me.

06:03.931 --> 06:06.365
But we've got to do this
in order to do that,

06:06.367 --> 06:07.799
so that's what we're doing.
Yeah, it's important.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.835
You're basically going to inflict
a religion on your child

06:09.837 --> 06:11.737
because you want to put them
in a particular kind of school?

06:11.739 --> 06:13.839
Yes, you've absolutely
hit the nail on the head.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.073
That's exactly
why we're doing it.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.208
Oh!

06:24.884 --> 06:25.984
What did he say?

06:25.986 --> 06:27.619
You can only eat the third one.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.988
Third rice, third Reich.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.157
- Conceptual.
- Mmh...

06:32.159 --> 06:33.158
Please.

06:33.526 --> 06:35.260
Try this for us.

06:37.764 --> 06:38.930
Oh...

06:38.932 --> 06:41.333
Shit the bed. Is it...

06:41.335 --> 06:42.734
Is it meant to taste like that?

06:42.736 --> 06:44.970
It's, um... it's political.

06:44.972 --> 06:48.039
Wow. I mean, that's exactly
what this christening needs.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.541
No, no, no, no,
what this christening needs

06:49.543 --> 06:51.410
is mini Shepherd's pies
from a reputable caterer,

06:51.412 --> 06:52.511
that's what
this christening needs.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.545
- Samuel...
- I'm just saying...

06:53.547 --> 06:55.680
just remember why we'e here.

06:55.682 --> 06:56.748
Yes.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.916
Dear sister,

06:57.918 --> 07:00.118
we have come to ask you...

07:00.120 --> 07:02.154
to be Auden's Godmother.

07:04.957 --> 07:06.425
Um...

07:07.160 --> 07:09.127
Is there a polite way
for me to say no?

07:09.129 --> 07:10.262
No.

07:13.499 --> 07:15.867
And renounce Satan, yes,
that is what I will be doing.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.202
Wow.

07:17.804 --> 07:20.071
Mum and dad would be so proud.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.407
Oh, everyone thinks god
is bullshit, melody.

07:22.409 --> 07:25.777
You just have to believe in a
good education for our child!

07:27.013 --> 07:28.146
Sam?

07:28.881 --> 07:30.148
Sam?

07:32.151 --> 07:34.753
Well, look, I'm gonna be on a low
serotonin comedown from burning man,

07:34.755 --> 07:37.122
and I really don't need
to be having flashbacks...

07:37.124 --> 07:38.757
in a church.

07:38.759 --> 07:41.092
Who on earth is Bernard Mann?

07:44.765 --> 07:47.365
So you're taking your teenager
to the Californian desert

07:47.367 --> 07:48.500
for two weeks

07:48.502 --> 07:50.101
so he can giveaway hot dogs
to people on drugs?

07:50.103 --> 07:51.903
He's 20, it's three weeks,
and they're burgers.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.605
And why do they get burgers
while I'm meant to serve

07:53.607 --> 07:55.707
fascist uncle Ben's
at my firstborn's christening?

07:55.709 --> 07:59.110
They're placenta burgers
cooked by the power of the sun.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.612
Of course, they are.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.618
Guten appetite.

08:13.192 --> 08:15.794
It's... anti-Semitic pastry.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.963
Yeah. It's a swastika...

08:17.965 --> 08:20.465
but it's art, you know,
it's conceptual.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.200
It's got sprinkles on it.

08:22.202 --> 08:26.371
Oh, sprinkles or hundreds
and thousands

08:26.373 --> 08:28.740
representing the hundreds
and thousands who died.

08:29.876 --> 08:33.111
Millions of people died,
Saskia, in the war.

08:33.113 --> 08:36.448
Millions... thousands...
Tom-may-to, to-mah-to.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.549
Keep drinking.

09:36.943 --> 09:37.976
Babe...

09:38.210 --> 09:39.945
Babe... babe!

09:40.546 --> 09:41.746
Babe!

09:42.081 --> 09:43.281
Babe, we're going
to burning man!

09:43.283 --> 09:44.449
We're going to burning man!

09:44.451 --> 09:45.784
Oh, well, what time is it?

09:45.786 --> 09:47.953
11:30. Look! I made breakfast.

09:48.754 --> 09:49.788
Mmh...

09:55.428 --> 09:56.828
Oh, um, by the way,

09:56.830 --> 09:58.830
I tried to buy
an industrial magnifying glass

09:58.832 --> 10:01.366
with your card,
but it got declined.

10:02.001 --> 10:03.969
- What card?
- The one you said.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.737
With the horse on it.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.174
Fucking Alan day.
He's such a fuck...

10:19.419 --> 10:22.454
what are you fucking up to?
He's onto you! Get out!

10:22.456 --> 10:24.556
Barry?

10:40.406 --> 10:42.607
You can't try and sack me.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.075
Try and sack you?

10:45.244 --> 10:46.845
I'll take you to tribunal.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.317
I've been in this game a lot
longer than you, melody.

10:55.588 --> 10:59.424
I've seen the cry-on-demand
trick before!

11:02.528 --> 11:05.296
My parents died three years ago
the day before Christmas.

11:05.298 --> 11:08.166
My boyfriend is a 20-year-old
fucking concept chef.

11:08.168 --> 11:11.436
If you let me fall
there is no one to catch me.

11:11.871 --> 11:13.805
I want the mobile, the day pass,

11:13.807 --> 11:16.574
and the range rover keys, now.

11:31.557 --> 11:32.857
I have been a customer
at this bank

11:32.859 --> 11:35.260
since I was seven years old.

11:37.096 --> 11:38.196
No.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.198
No, I understand that, but...

11:41.400 --> 11:44.836
Will you please, please
just extend my overdraft?

11:47.506 --> 11:48.673
So I just don't understand

11:48.675 --> 11:50.542
how it can take a week
to do a background check.

11:50.544 --> 11:53.978
No, I'm not going to a fucking
pay day loans company!

12:01.454 --> 12:03.321
So, I'll just be two minutes
and I'll get some cash.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.856
No problem. Okay.

12:11.130 --> 12:12.597
We don't need money, babe.

12:12.599 --> 12:13.832
There is no money
at burning man.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.968
Listen, I'm saying
we just rock this stage

12:16.970 --> 12:18.236
with nothing but each other,

12:18.238 --> 12:20.238
a freezer full of placentas,
and a dream.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.173
Come on, Harmony,
we do need money.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.275
What about petrol,
water in the desert?

12:24.277 --> 12:26.077
Babe, in-in Cuba

12:26.079 --> 12:28.847
they make the petrol
out of sugar cubes,

12:28.849 --> 12:30.048
or canes.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.283
But, look, and people
will gift us water!

12:32.285 --> 12:33.918
And you've always wanted
to go to burning man!

12:33.920 --> 12:35.220
You said we've paid for it all,
we might as well go to...

12:35.222 --> 12:37.388
babe! Come on!

12:40.092 --> 12:41.693
Oh, babe, I'm sorry.

12:42.361 --> 12:44.095
I'm being selfish.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.530
We'll go next year.

12:49.902 --> 12:51.202
Or never.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.538
Oh, babe. I'm sorry.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.077
We can get money.

13:00.246 --> 13:01.246
How?

13:07.253 --> 13:09.487
- Going to burning man.
- We're going to burning man?

13:09.489 --> 13:11.823
- We're going to burning man.
- Oh, fuck!

13:12.958 --> 13:14.192
I love you.

13:20.199 --> 13:22.267
Yeah, sorry about that.
Took a bit of time.

13:22.269 --> 13:23.668
Harmony, we're not flying
over the Atlantic

13:23.670 --> 13:25.270
in a small plane
with propellors.

13:26.238 --> 13:29.374
I don't know, I've not
been much since flying over.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.811
Well, hello. If it isn't
lofty the land baron.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.445
Uh, yeah. Great. Whatever.

13:34.447 --> 13:37.782
So I'm getting pretty fucking
pissed off about this flat,

13:37.784 --> 13:39.484
if I'm being honest,

13:39.486 --> 13:42.320
so I was speaking to the agent

13:42.322 --> 13:44.556
and I'm putting it up for rent.

13:44.723 --> 13:46.024
What?

13:46.358 --> 13:48.126
You're evicting me?

13:48.128 --> 13:50.261
Um, no...

13:50.263 --> 13:52.363
Well, yeah.
Obviously yes.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.032
I am.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.533
Look, sorry,
this is a really crap time.

13:55.535 --> 13:56.501
Can I just call you back?

13:56.503 --> 13:57.635
I'm just going into a meeting.

13:57.637 --> 13:58.903
No, no, no, no, wait.
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

13:58.905 --> 14:01.873
I will get you the money.
I will pay the rent.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.541
Sure. Whatever.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.944
Okay, so there's a guy
from charlatans

14:05.946 --> 14:08.279
coming this afternoon
to take photos of the flat.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.882
When it's online you're free
to spend the £5,000

14:10.884 --> 14:12.250
like anybody else and rent it.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.219
I've got £1,010, Tommy.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.020
Well, that's £3,990 to go!

14:16.022 --> 14:17.355
Mind the doors.

14:20.125 --> 14:22.227
What?
Is he-is he kicking you out?

14:23.295 --> 14:25.330
He's taking my home.

14:31.237 --> 14:33.805
Mel, we'll be on one of
those planes in a second!

14:33.807 --> 14:35.640
San Francisco,
now in it's final stage...

14:35.642 --> 14:37.876
Oh my god, babe,
look at the propellor...

14:37.878 --> 14:39.477
babe, come on.

14:40.279 --> 14:43.414
Can't put it online if they
can't get into the flat.

14:43.582 --> 14:45.483
- What?
- If I can stop them taking the photos

14:45.485 --> 14:47.051
and doing the floor plan,

14:47.053 --> 14:49.120
then that will buy me the time
to get the four grand

14:49.122 --> 14:50.922
for the deposit, and then,
then I can keep the flat.

14:50.924 --> 14:55.326
Do you know how hard it is to get
300 placentas in California?

14:55.328 --> 14:56.494
Last call for passengers...

14:56.496 --> 14:58.630
Look, babe, some of the biggest
food blogs in the world

14:58.632 --> 14:59.764
go to burning man.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.332
They're really changing
what food is out there.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.368
Food is just food, okay.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.003
They are not changing
what food is,

15:05.005 --> 15:06.704
they're just a bunch of twats
pissing around in the desert.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.840
I find it hard to believe that
you think food is just food.

15:08.842 --> 15:11.743
This is my home!
We have to defend it!

15:11.745 --> 15:12.844
Come on!

15:27.026 --> 15:28.626
You're safe.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.028
You're safe now.

15:37.569 --> 15:38.937
There is nothing else
about placentas

15:38.939 --> 15:40.872
on the post cuisine circuit
right now.

15:40.874 --> 15:43.074
It'll be yesterday's news
next year!

15:43.076 --> 15:44.943
Showtime.

15:53.852 --> 15:56.120
Is this even legal, melody?

15:56.122 --> 15:57.555
We're at war here, Harmony!

15:57.557 --> 16:00.358
Legality is a luxury
that we do not have.

16:00.993 --> 16:02.860
Okay, look, babe,

16:02.862 --> 16:06.564
I know that you're upset,
but this, this is important...

16:07.666 --> 16:11.102
and that's why you can do
your food concept thingy

16:11.104 --> 16:13.137
- love plus food?
- Uh-huh.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.572
- Here?
- Uh-huh.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.941
But you said you'd rather
be gang raped by koala bears!

16:16.943 --> 16:18.242
Yeah,
but I've basically realized

16:18.244 --> 16:19.711
it's a really good idea!

16:19.713 --> 16:21.112
Yeah!

16:21.114 --> 16:25.116
But first we've got to stop
this fucker from getting in.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.484
Okay.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.822
Oi, charlatans,
get the fuck out!

16:30.824 --> 16:32.056
Yeah, fuck off!

16:32.058 --> 16:34.258
Get the fuck out my house!

16:34.260 --> 16:36.461
What the fuck are you doing?

16:36.463 --> 16:38.763
Are you fucking crazy?!

16:39.164 --> 16:40.698
Crazy bastards!

16:41.433 --> 16:42.734
Brick?

16:42.736 --> 16:43.634
Piss?

16:43.636 --> 16:44.769
Basically, medicinal.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.205
I've only been drinking vodka
and berocca this morning.

16:47.706 --> 16:49.073
I'll be back, you bastards!

16:49.075 --> 16:50.108
Take that, you little shit!

16:50.110 --> 16:52.343
Oh, Christ, this place is worse

16:52.345 --> 16:55.980
than fucking Johannesburg
on a Friday fucking night.

16:56.148 --> 16:58.216
Woo!

17:04.923 --> 17:06.590
Melsy-babes, how's it going?

17:06.593 --> 17:07.825
You tell me, Charlie!

17:07.827 --> 17:09.193
Fucking mental.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.095
You would not believe
where I ended up last night.

17:11.097 --> 17:12.296
Check it out.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.901
I had sex with that guy.

17:18.337 --> 17:19.670
That's a wonderful image,
Charlie.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.406
So, what have you got for me?

17:21.407 --> 17:23.608
Um, right
what have I got for you?

17:23.609 --> 17:25.443
What do... well-the...

17:25.444 --> 17:27.512
Okay, here's the thing, melsy,

17:27.513 --> 17:30.248
you are what we like to call
in the headhunting industry...

17:30.716 --> 17:33.051
um... a person...

17:33.053 --> 17:35.219
who I cannot get a job for.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.121
Charlie, you tapped me up,
three weeks ago,

17:37.123 --> 17:38.556
saying that you could get me
a job anywhere.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.925
Yeah, I did, but that
was before you went around

17:40.927 --> 17:42.827
stealing from your employer
and blackmailing him,

17:42.829 --> 17:44.028
you know, which, all in all,

17:44.030 --> 17:45.296
makes you look
like a bit of a crook.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.365
I'm just being honest.
Thank you very much.

17:48.033 --> 17:50.568
I won intelligence monthly's
industry's most promising

17:50.570 --> 17:52.804
this year and 2013.

17:52.806 --> 17:57.041
That is a prize that they give to the
most successfully duplicitous person

17:57.043 --> 17:59.177
under the age of 30
in an industry that's based

17:59.179 --> 18:00.945
on nicking
other people's information.

18:00.947 --> 18:02.013
They want crooks.
Okay.

18:02.015 --> 18:06.851
Between me and you, the economy
is awful at the moment.

18:10.222 --> 18:12.090
Charlie, I'm about
to be evicted.

18:12.092 --> 18:15.026
You've got a lovely figure.
Why don't you become an escort?

18:15.028 --> 18:17.361
What? Is that the advice
you give to all your clients?

18:17.363 --> 18:19.163
Only my fit ones...

18:19.165 --> 18:21.966
who are otherwise
completely unemployable.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.734
Or you could be a drug dealer,

18:23.736 --> 18:25.369
except you'd trouble
with the police

18:25.371 --> 18:27.071
and it's
bad for the environment.

18:27.639 --> 18:28.706
Sell a kidney?

18:28.708 --> 18:30.908
Wow, thank you, Charlie.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.610
Your help has been invaluable.

18:53.098 --> 18:54.465
Aah.

18:57.202 --> 18:59.303
I mean,
how would your mother feel?

19:00.873 --> 19:02.373
So, how much for a kidney?

19:02.375 --> 19:04.275
I'm fuckin' ashamed of you.

19:07.246 --> 19:09.413
According to the blood report,

19:09.415 --> 19:11.315
technically you're not
even alive.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.050
Go. Yeah.

19:21.260 --> 19:24.595
Do you realize that
this line's recorded, yeah?

19:24.597 --> 19:26.864
I can categorically state
that I do not intend to

19:26.866 --> 19:27.999
and have never been involved in

19:28.001 --> 19:29.800
any insider trading
or libel fixing.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.369
Oh, come on, banker-boy,

19:31.371 --> 19:32.837
surely you
and your little banker friends

19:32.839 --> 19:34.872
must have fiddled the figures
at some time,

19:34.874 --> 19:36.340
like that guy, Clive?

19:38.076 --> 19:40.077
Why don't you just go to a job
center like a normal person?

19:40.079 --> 19:41.112
Sam, I'm not a normal person.

19:41.114 --> 19:43.080
There's no way I'm gonna go
to a job center.

19:43.082 --> 19:44.749
You know, this whole thing
would be so much easier

19:44.751 --> 19:46.817
if you just gave me £4,097...

19:46.819 --> 19:51.455
Well, not gave,
lent me £4,097.53...

19:51.457 --> 19:52.590
and I'm done.

19:52.592 --> 19:53.824
Found it!

19:56.528 --> 19:57.662
Excellent!

19:57.664 --> 19:59.764
Ah.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.399
What are you gonna use it for?

20:01.900 --> 20:03.568
Sorry.

20:03.570 --> 20:04.936
Sorry, it's a bit
of a bad line here.

20:04.938 --> 20:06.871
I've just been on the phone
to the agent

20:06.873 --> 20:08.739
and he said somebody pissed
on him.

20:08.741 --> 20:11.509
Piss?! What, someone pissed
on his head?

20:11.511 --> 20:12.577
Oh, god, that's awful.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.545
Melody, melody?

20:14.547 --> 20:17.782
Melody, do you know
what a hostile tenant is?

20:19.218 --> 20:20.985
Yeah, it's what they call it...

20:20.987 --> 20:22.486
it's what they call it
when someone tries

20:22.488 --> 20:25.489
to intentionally sabotage
the viewings, you understand?

20:25.491 --> 20:26.991
Tommy,

20:26.993 --> 20:29.527
why would I want
to sabotage the viewings, hm?

20:36.468 --> 20:38.202
Tracker activated.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.743
Okay.

20:52.618 --> 20:56.020
So... really I don't need
to give you the keys

20:56.022 --> 20:58.623
because I'm going to be
renting it very soon, anyway.

20:58.625 --> 20:59.690
Oh, that's Lekker.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.926
All I need is the full deposit
in cash

21:01.928 --> 21:04.195
and clearance of the reference
check application,

21:04.197 --> 21:07.098
which you will put
into this in tray.

21:07.100 --> 21:11.502
So, in a few days I'm going
to have all of that for you.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.638
No, that's Lekker.
In the meantime,

21:13.640 --> 21:18.075
I'm under instruction that this
highly desirable loft space

21:18.077 --> 21:20.711
is to remain on the market...

21:20.713 --> 21:22.079
so...

21:23.115 --> 21:24.982
I need the keys.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.484
Look,

21:26.486 --> 21:29.887
I'm sure we can come
to some kind of agreement.

21:39.998 --> 21:43.067
Do you know how long
I've been at this branch?

21:47.072 --> 21:48.806
42 months.

21:49.374 --> 21:50.741
You can count them.

21:51.276 --> 21:52.843
39 of those,

21:52.845 --> 21:55.513
I've been sales agent
number one!

21:56.048 --> 21:58.549
You're looking
at the best in show.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.151
Wow, do you want a prize?

22:01.420 --> 22:02.687
Every month.

22:08.527 --> 22:09.627
Keys.

22:23.241 --> 22:24.809
Hoo...

22:26.011 --> 22:27.878
You're playing with fire,
little lady.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.180
One week.

22:29.182 --> 22:32.316
One week without those photos or
the floor plans on the website,

22:32.318 --> 22:33.384
and then I will have your money,

22:33.386 --> 22:36.153
plus a little extra
just for you.

22:36.155 --> 22:37.588
Are you trying to bribe me?

22:37.590 --> 22:40.124
£100... 300.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.592
I'm an estate agent.

22:41.594 --> 22:44.495
We follow a strict
moral and ethical code!

22:48.967 --> 22:52.937
800...
Two pounds and 45 pence.

22:52.939 --> 22:55.539
That is my final offer, okay?

22:55.541 --> 22:58.476
I'm just gonna leave that there
in your little special in tray

22:58.478 --> 23:01.746
and I'm gonna walk away, okay?

23:06.418 --> 23:09.620
You're one crazy camper!
You know that?

23:32.911 --> 23:34.245
Nope.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.881
How would you rate
your Google skills?

23:36.883 --> 23:38.382
Do you mean can I write?

23:38.384 --> 23:40.618
Would you say you have
good interpersonal skills?

23:45.323 --> 23:47.191
Motherfucker!

23:50.095 --> 23:51.929
Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.999
It's raining men, hallelujah

23:58.470 --> 24:01.172
amen, I'm gonna get out...

24:08.547 --> 24:10.448
Gonna get myself wet

24:10.450 --> 24:13.951
absolutely soaking wet

24:25.564 --> 24:28.098
it's raining men, hallelu...

24:44.015 --> 24:45.683
what the fuck?!

24:54.226 --> 24:55.359
Check it out!

24:55.361 --> 24:58.462
This company
does liquid nitrogen

24:58.464 --> 25:00.297
in 19th century milk churns.

25:00.299 --> 25:01.732
Oh, Jesus, Harmony!

25:01.734 --> 25:02.900
Sorry.

25:06.972 --> 25:08.305
Lemon.

25:08.307 --> 25:09.640
Orange.

25:09.642 --> 25:10.674
Lettuce.

25:12.644 --> 25:13.911
Leave that there.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.616
Harmony, there's another one
for you.

25:18.618 --> 25:22.052
How many did you get?
Just put it here.

25:23.788 --> 25:25.322
Oh, right.

25:33.431 --> 25:34.431
Ah!

25:35.166 --> 25:36.333
Oh!

25:36.335 --> 25:38.736
Sorry, babe,
completely forgot about them.

25:40.105 --> 25:43.440
They're probably a bit off
by now.

25:50.949 --> 25:53.250
Mr. and Mrs. Burton-hall,
how are you?

25:53.252 --> 25:54.451
Mr. Burton hall.
Good to see you.

25:54.453 --> 25:55.886
- Mrs. Burton-hall.
- Oh!

25:55.888 --> 25:57.655
You look absolutely stunning.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.657
Come with me.
Have a look at this apartment.

25:59.659 --> 26:00.958
Beautiful, eh?

26:00.960 --> 26:04.695
They sometimes drop their
business onto the floor, yeah?

26:04.697 --> 26:06.964
Now, look at this.
Security is very tight.

26:06.966 --> 26:08.098
Even Oscar Pistorius

26:08.100 --> 26:09.733
wouldn't be able to shoot
through this door, eh?

26:11.404 --> 26:14.204
Be prepared to see
the apartment of your dreams.

26:14.206 --> 26:17.341
I'm sure there's a light switch
in here somewhere.

26:17.343 --> 26:18.342
Lights!

26:18.344 --> 26:19.610
- Jesus Christ.
- Christ!

26:19.612 --> 26:21.011
What the fuck?

26:21.013 --> 26:23.347
Look, I know we said
that we wanted an urban feel,

26:23.349 --> 26:25.449
but this-this is just sick!

26:25.451 --> 26:27.918
Hello JP!

26:27.920 --> 26:29.553
Oh, don't mind us.

26:29.555 --> 26:31.589
I-I was just going to
put the kettle on.

26:31.591 --> 26:33.123
- Oh! Oh, oh!
- Oh, god!

26:33.125 --> 26:37.161
Oh, this is happening again!

26:37.163 --> 26:38.796
No, wait. Wait!

26:38.798 --> 26:41.098
You have to see past the décor!

26:44.903 --> 26:47.404
Well done, baby.

26:47.406 --> 26:48.472
Mmh...!

27:08.393 --> 27:09.994
Melody!

27:11.697 --> 27:13.697
Open the fucking door!

27:21.339 --> 27:23.240
Still worshiping Satan, then?

27:27.178 --> 27:28.479
Here you go.

27:30.015 --> 27:31.315
I said wait-rose.

27:31.317 --> 27:32.483
Tough shit.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.757
How can you be
this hard up, anyway?

27:39.759 --> 27:41.859
You must have some of the
payout from the restaurant,

27:41.861 --> 27:43.160
right?

27:44.863 --> 27:48.999
You-you've spent £230,000
in three years?

27:49.001 --> 27:51.802
No, I spent it in two.
Well, just under two.

27:51.804 --> 27:53.637
On what?
What did you spend it on?

27:54.072 --> 27:57.074
Meals out, mostly.
Kitchen stuff.

27:57.076 --> 27:59.076
You're fucking joking me,
aren't you?

28:00.378 --> 28:02.546
You spent a quarter
of a million pounds on

28:02.548 --> 28:04.481
restaurants and kitchen stuff.

28:04.483 --> 28:06.884
You-you're not even
paying rent.

28:06.886 --> 28:08.719
Well, obviously I can't
afford to.

28:09.087 --> 28:11.422
Oh, this is mad.
That is...

28:11.424 --> 28:13.057
I mean, I don't know
what kind of mad that is,

28:13.059 --> 28:14.658
but that's fucking mad.

28:16.128 --> 28:17.561
Oh...

28:18.029 --> 28:20.397
What's mad auntie melody
going to do, eh?

28:20.399 --> 28:23.167
- All right! Um...
- Nasty daddy won't help her.

28:23.169 --> 28:24.234
Okay.

28:24.636 --> 28:26.770
I'll speak to Saskia.

28:27.405 --> 28:29.540
She was telling me she's got
an opening for some...

28:29.542 --> 28:30.908
vacuous bullshit artist.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.342
I think you're wildly
overqualified for it,

28:32.344 --> 28:35.946
but Saskia won't give me a job
after Godmother-gate.

28:36.514 --> 28:38.215
Yes, she will.

28:38.217 --> 28:41.952
But you are just going to have
to grovel to her, aren't you?

28:42.554 --> 28:44.822
Is auntie melody going to have
to grovel to Saskia?

28:44.824 --> 28:46.290
Yes, she is!

28:46.292 --> 28:48.592
Saskia, is going to be
very angry at melody,

28:48.594 --> 28:51.128
but melody doesn't care
'cause she needs a job!

28:51.130 --> 28:52.796
That's fun, isn't it?

28:52.798 --> 28:54.998
- You're a dick.
- Yeah, I know.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.301
And you're a dick.
A massive dick.

28:58.803 --> 29:00.437
Yeah, we've got Cher Lloyd
coming in.

29:00.439 --> 29:03.841
Jungle book Mufasa thing
with her.

29:03.975 --> 29:05.342
Okay.

29:06.177 --> 29:10.414
So, Metro bitch, hit me.

29:10.416 --> 29:11.749
Metro bitch?

29:11.751 --> 29:13.117
Yeah, it's great, isn't it?

29:13.119 --> 29:14.551
It's kind of what's trending,

29:14.553 --> 29:17.554
but at the same time,
a state of the nation analysis:

29:17.556 --> 29:19.690
Thackeray meets Woolf,
but with Twitter.

29:20.059 --> 29:24.461
The red carpet is out,
it's opening night.

29:24.463 --> 29:25.929
What is the premier

29:25.931 --> 29:28.398
melody Munro Metro bitch column?

29:29.734 --> 29:31.335
N-now?

29:31.337 --> 29:33.704
Just idea shower me.

29:34.405 --> 29:36.373
I was-i was kind of thinking

29:36.375 --> 29:38.442
I wouldn't need to interview
for this job.

29:38.444 --> 29:43.680
21st century journalism
is constantly revolutionizing.

29:43.682 --> 29:44.948
You know, by the time
you've written now

29:44.950 --> 29:46.650
it's already last year.

29:46.652 --> 29:48.452
Tomorrow's now
has already been snapchatted

29:48.454 --> 29:51.488
by a 16-year-old info blogger
from Malaysia.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.757
I don't follow.

29:54.025 --> 29:56.026
I've been seeing other
applicants for this job,

29:56.028 --> 29:58.095
so I guess, Melly,

29:58.097 --> 30:01.799
it's just a case of...
How much you want it.

30:04.169 --> 30:06.537
I'm really sorry
about the godmother thing.

30:07.772 --> 30:09.072
Thank you.

30:09.374 --> 30:10.574
So?

30:11.409 --> 30:12.676
I have the job?

30:13.344 --> 30:16.013
I'm really grateful
that you apologized, melody,

30:16.015 --> 30:18.482
and family is so important
to me.

30:19.150 --> 30:22.052
But... if I'm honest,

30:22.054 --> 30:26.223
this other applicant has all
the skills to nail this job.

30:26.225 --> 30:27.758
Who is it?

30:27.760 --> 30:30.427
Oh, you know her! Laurie mills!

30:30.429 --> 30:32.129
Yeah, I mean she really
has her finger

30:32.131 --> 30:34.765
on the pulse
of the Zeitline generation.

30:35.733 --> 30:37.634
She's a massive cunt.

30:37.636 --> 30:39.236
Cunt.

30:42.140 --> 30:45.843
So, yeah, I...
I really think...

30:46.277 --> 30:47.644
Cunt.

30:48.213 --> 30:49.613
Just get out.

30:54.385 --> 30:55.485
Cunt.

30:55.487 --> 30:56.987
Faster.

31:36.427 --> 31:38.595
Babe. Oh!

31:40.164 --> 31:41.698
Babe, what are you doing?

31:41.700 --> 31:43.500
Don't tell me. Listen.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.235
Amazing news.

31:45.237 --> 31:46.904
You know my auntie Babs?
Yeah.

31:46.906 --> 31:48.238
- The Pedo.
- Yeah.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.806
She just died.

31:49.808 --> 31:51.408
What? God, I'm so sorry.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.076
No. It's fine.

31:53.078 --> 31:55.445
She's now communing
with the lord of hosts.

31:55.447 --> 31:56.947
Imagine that.

31:56.949 --> 32:01.285
Anyway, more amazing,
I've inherited £4,000.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.554
Harmony, that-that's amazing.

32:04.556 --> 32:09.860
Babe, it means love plus food
can now be how I imagined it!

32:11.129 --> 32:13.263
- What?
- Listen, check it out.

32:28.713 --> 32:32.282
Isn't it amazing you always
get what you pray for?

32:36.154 --> 32:37.321
Great.

32:40.992 --> 32:43.160
I want you to get down
on your knees now

32:43.162 --> 32:45.829
and start to pray...

32:45.831 --> 32:47.998
because the day
of atonement, my friends,

32:48.000 --> 32:51.034
is at hand,
and he brings not peace,

32:51.036 --> 32:52.836
he brings a sword,

32:52.838 --> 32:54.972
and behind him is fire!

32:54.974 --> 32:58.041
And if you do not
adhere to his creed,

32:58.043 --> 33:00.777
he will beat you, senselessly,

33:00.779 --> 33:03.613
like someone else's
redheaded stepchild!

33:03.615 --> 33:06.883
Do not listen to that fat cat
in a pointy hat...

33:14.625 --> 33:16.493
yes! Get in!

33:17.428 --> 33:20.030
Just one more win,
one more win and we're safe.

33:21.265 --> 33:23.934
Can't bluff me, ashraf_17.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.106
Harmony, I'm kind of
in the middle of something,

33:29.108 --> 33:30.040
something really important.

33:30.042 --> 33:32.009
Mel, Mel, babe, look who's here!

33:32.610 --> 33:35.278
Melody, you're missing
the revolution!

33:35.280 --> 33:38.949
Harmony is so totes amaze, BTW.
Love and Nong!

33:38.951 --> 33:41.685
Laurie's gonna come to love
plus food and do an article

33:41.687 --> 33:43.653
about it for her new
Metro bitch column.

33:43.655 --> 33:45.122
How Nong is that?

33:45.124 --> 33:46.690
Woohoo!

33:51.029 --> 33:52.829
Ah! N...

33:56.034 --> 33:58.101
aah

34:03.575 --> 34:05.909
miss Munro,
I know you're in there!

34:06.278 --> 34:10.213
The hermit crab cannot stay
in the shell for too long,

34:10.215 --> 34:12.616
it has to come out and breathe!

34:13.317 --> 34:14.717
Open!

34:16.554 --> 34:17.888
Miss Munro,

34:17.889 --> 34:20.322
you cannot fight
with the market.

34:20.324 --> 34:22.759
The market is like god,

34:22.761 --> 34:26.163
all-seeing, all-knowing,
omnipresent...

34:26.998 --> 34:28.565
so open the door!

34:36.340 --> 34:38.909
Miss Munro,
please open the door.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.279
I don't want
to do anything rash.

34:48.619 --> 34:50.821
September,
the German ring closed.

34:56.929 --> 35:01.531
Mel, don't leave me standing
out here like a twat, please.

35:02.033 --> 35:03.366
I've got booze.

35:09.073 --> 35:10.307
Beer o'clock?

35:11.075 --> 35:14.945
Eh, don't-don't-don't
shut the door in my face,

35:14.947 --> 35:18.715
because I am about to do
something incredibly stupid.

35:18.717 --> 35:20.050
What?

35:21.085 --> 35:22.385
I'm gonna give you the money.

35:24.122 --> 35:27.491
- Yes!
- Yay! Best brother ever!

35:27.493 --> 35:29.526
Now, listen, this...
Is a temporary loan

35:29.528 --> 35:30.627
from Auden's University fund.

35:30.629 --> 35:31.828
There are rules to this, okay?

35:31.830 --> 35:33.263
Okay, anything.

35:34.699 --> 35:36.099
You're to be godmother.

35:36.767 --> 35:37.834
R-really?

35:37.836 --> 35:40.036
Really? Wow.
Do you want the money?

35:40.805 --> 35:44.641
Sam, I would love
to be Auden's godmother.

35:51.682 --> 35:53.116
Oh, I'll be back in a minute.

35:53.118 --> 35:54.351
Where you going?

35:54.819 --> 35:55.886
Mwah!

36:00.992 --> 36:03.193
Yep. That's... typical.

36:03.961 --> 36:05.162
Raining men

36:05.164 --> 36:07.330
- hey! I can take the flat!
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

36:07.332 --> 36:08.598
- I can take the flat!
- Christ!

36:08.600 --> 36:10.634
I've got the money.
I can give it to you right now!

36:11.235 --> 36:13.570
It's 8:30, you crazy woman.

36:13.572 --> 36:14.671
I'm going home!

36:14.673 --> 36:16.306
Okay, okay, I'll come see you

36:16.308 --> 36:17.941
in the office first thing, yeah?

36:17.943 --> 36:19.409
Get off the vehicle!

36:19.411 --> 36:21.178
Get away from the vehicle!
Okay!

36:21.180 --> 36:22.746
- Get away from the vehicle!
- Okay, I'll see you first thing.

36:22.748 --> 36:25.215
Ha, ha, ha! Woo!
Yeah! Whatever!

36:41.265 --> 36:43.500
I love you,
and I love this flat,

36:43.502 --> 36:45.135
and I love you in this flat,

36:45.137 --> 36:47.637
and I think they should
stock you in Boconcepts.

36:47.639 --> 36:49.472
Babe, babe, babe, try this.

36:49.474 --> 36:50.640
- Hm?
- Try this.

36:53.311 --> 36:56.246
Oh, that is...
that's really a lot of salt.

36:56.248 --> 36:58.114
- Amazing!
- Bit too much?

36:58.116 --> 36:59.649
No, babe, no!

36:59.651 --> 37:01.785
Tell Gandhi
there was too much salt.

37:01.787 --> 37:05.322
Gandhi couldn't get any salt,
so he marched on the sea.

37:05.324 --> 37:06.957
Salt caused a revolution.

37:06.959 --> 37:11.494
That searing dryness
is the taste of a revolution!

37:12.464 --> 37:13.530
Suffer.

37:14.599 --> 37:15.699
Visionary.

37:15.701 --> 37:17.667
Completely
and utterly visionary.

37:17.669 --> 37:19.236
Huh? Thanks.

37:19.637 --> 37:21.304
It's pretty fucking Nong, huh?

37:21.306 --> 37:23.773
This is the crest
of a new epoch.

37:24.342 --> 37:27.544
It's like being in
the cavern club at '62, or...

37:27.546 --> 37:28.912
Berlin, 1933?

37:28.914 --> 37:30.847
Yes. I love Berlin.

37:30.849 --> 37:33.316
Right, I'm really sorry, but we're going
to have to keep the kitchen clear.

37:33.318 --> 37:34.451
Oops, sorry!

37:34.453 --> 37:35.518
Just trying to say hi
to the maestro!

37:35.520 --> 37:39.122
And also I did think I'd take a
couple of photos while I'm here

37:39.124 --> 37:41.124
just 'cause the agent said
he couldn't get in to take any.

37:41.126 --> 37:43.927
Oh, well I'm afraid the flat's
not for rent anymore.

37:43.929 --> 37:47.597
Oh, yes, I know, I'm not-
I'm not renting it, so...

37:47.599 --> 37:49.532
Then why are you taking photos?

37:49.534 --> 37:50.934
Because I'm buying it.

37:51.235 --> 37:53.069
So if you could just move

37:53.071 --> 37:54.904
'cause you're kind of
in my visual space.

37:55.773 --> 37:59.409
My flat is not for fucking sale.

38:05.082 --> 38:06.583
Okay, just take the flat!
Take the flat.

38:06.585 --> 38:07.951
I accept your offer.
Just take the fucking flat.

38:07.953 --> 38:09.653
Sir, put the mask back on.

38:15.726 --> 38:16.860
Why?

38:16.862 --> 38:18.395
Why are you doing this?

38:19.430 --> 38:20.697
I'm just trying to live my life!

38:20.699 --> 38:21.698
No, you're not.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.933
You're trying to live
my fucking life!

38:24.702 --> 38:25.935
Get out!

38:26.570 --> 38:27.771
Mel!

38:28.806 --> 38:31.074
How on earth can I write
my piece for Metro bitch,

38:31.076 --> 38:33.476
though, if I haven't tried
our beautiful chef's cuisine?

38:33.478 --> 38:35.278
Oh, just fuck off!

38:35.746 --> 38:37.047
Mel, I really need this piece!

38:37.049 --> 38:39.149
No, don't you dare!
Don't you dare take her side!

38:39.151 --> 38:43.086
Well, you can serve the food
to her outside on the street,

38:43.088 --> 38:44.654
because that's where
she's going to fucking be.

38:44.656 --> 38:45.922
Yeah, well, maybe I will.

38:52.296 --> 38:53.863
Fine. Fine.

38:53.865 --> 38:56.199
Well, you can take
all of your twats with you.

38:56.467 --> 38:58.735
- Oh!
- Oh, melody!

39:00.504 --> 39:03.606
Get out. Get out. Get out.
Get out. Get out. Get out.

39:06.511 --> 39:09.179
Get out of my fucking flat!

39:11.982 --> 39:13.216
Awkward.

39:13.218 --> 39:16.219
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
that is the end of part one!

39:16.221 --> 39:19.456
Part two, it seems,
is outside on road!

39:19.458 --> 39:20.990
Take your plates!

39:26.364 --> 39:30.066
Sitting at tables
is so mid-noughties, isn't it?

40:07.004 --> 40:09.472
Harmony? Harmony?

40:12.344 --> 40:16.179
Yeah, it's great energy
out here, motherfuckers!

41:01.959 --> 41:04.861
Melody, baby, great event.

41:04.863 --> 41:07.130
Loved the drama. Transformative.

41:07.132 --> 41:09.232
So I'll be around with
my surveyor in the morning.

41:09.234 --> 41:11.034
Should have the exchange
within the month.

41:11.036 --> 41:12.469
Nong!

42:17.134 --> 42:18.201
I've got it!

42:18.203 --> 42:20.003
I've got your dimensions!

42:20.005 --> 42:22.672
Nothing can stop
the JP de Kock...

42:22.674 --> 42:24.407
five day house seller.

42:24.409 --> 42:27.343
No, no, no, you can't exchange
a property in five days!

42:27.345 --> 42:28.711
No, you can't,

42:28.713 --> 42:31.514
not unless
your name's JP de Kock.

42:31.516 --> 42:33.149
I've done the searches.

42:33.751 --> 42:36.019
I taught myself Conveyancy Law.

42:36.353 --> 42:38.187
I've just done the survey.

42:38.756 --> 42:43.960
The market has spoken
and I am its instrument.

42:43.962 --> 42:46.663
But-but I need
a little bit more time.

43:03.113 --> 43:05.114
Another trader
jumped off Coq Au Vin's roof

43:05.116 --> 43:08.451
well I would, too,
if I had to eat their food.

43:10.220 --> 43:13.089
I sometimes get a feeling
I'm on an escalator.

43:13.091 --> 43:16.225
Everyone says if you stay on it
you're going somewhere good.

43:17.094 --> 43:20.530
Everyone else is on it so,
you know, must be good.

43:21.131 --> 43:23.199
It's going up, isn't it?

43:24.802 --> 43:26.502
Then sometimes you get
the feeling that actually

43:26.504 --> 43:29.539
it may just end up
somewhere completely shit.

43:30.007 --> 43:33.009
Or maybe it doesn't end up
anywhere at all, maybe it just...

43:33.011 --> 43:34.911
just keeps going up.

43:34.913 --> 43:36.112
Do you ever think that?

43:36.114 --> 43:39.315
What, that my life is
a drifting sea of mediocrity

43:39.317 --> 43:42.118
and the only certainty
is my inevitable death?

43:42.120 --> 43:43.353
Yeah.

43:43.787 --> 43:45.088
No, not really.

43:45.090 --> 43:46.289
So what do you think of my plan?

43:46.291 --> 43:48.925
Getting Laurie to ditch
her article on Harmony

43:48.927 --> 43:50.994
and writing
an anti-charlatan piece.

43:50.996 --> 43:53.363
I thought that was
just a deranged rant.

43:53.998 --> 43:56.299
When did you and saskia
get married?

43:57.668 --> 43:59.602
2011.

44:00.004 --> 44:02.805
You were there. You were
bridesmaid, for fuck's sake.

44:03.975 --> 44:05.675
Oh, yeah.

44:08.112 --> 44:09.946
You're being stranger
than usual.

44:10.615 --> 44:14.951
The key to intelligence work
as psychological leverage.

44:14.953 --> 44:16.486
You need to find out
what motivates people

44:16.488 --> 44:18.821
and then you can use that
to manipulate them.

44:18.823 --> 44:20.323
It's not gonna change her mind
about buying the flat

44:20.325 --> 44:21.591
because you send her
a few emails.

44:21.593 --> 44:23.026
People aren't
that impressionable.

44:23.028 --> 44:24.494
No, it's not just that.

44:24.496 --> 44:26.963
I mean, take saskia,
for example.

44:26.965 --> 44:28.464
What's her core motivation?

44:28.466 --> 44:29.666
I don't know,
probably to get other people

44:29.668 --> 44:31.467
to give her the perfect life,
career and family

44:31.469 --> 44:34.037
while expending
no effort herself.

44:40.310 --> 44:41.544
Yeah, well I've thought
about it,

44:41.546 --> 44:44.914
and what drives Laurie
is her desire to not miss out,

44:44.916 --> 44:46.883
driven, no doubt,
by some deep-seated...

44:46.885 --> 44:48.384
childhood trauma
that her parents

44:48.386 --> 44:50.086
didn't take her to Disneyland
or whatever.

44:50.088 --> 44:52.021
It still burns.

44:52.023 --> 44:54.057
Mmm, so all I need to do
is convince her

44:54.059 --> 44:56.826
that there's more cool in writing
this anti-charlatans campaign

44:56.828 --> 44:58.494
than there is
in stealing my life!

45:00.230 --> 45:03.966
Fucking hell,
Zencorp is plummeting!

45:03.968 --> 45:06.736
Wh-why are you even calling me?

45:06.738 --> 45:07.970
Why do you keep
asking me about saskia?

45:07.972 --> 45:09.806
Oh, I just wanna know
about my family.

45:09.808 --> 45:12.909
No, no, no, you're doing your
spying thing again, aren't you?

45:12.911 --> 45:14.911
Yeah, that's what you're doing.
You stop that right now.

45:14.913 --> 45:16.412
Thank you, Sam.
This talk has helped.

45:28.258 --> 45:29.859
Sorry, you were saying?

45:29.861 --> 45:31.661
Oh, yes.

45:31.663 --> 45:34.230
Look, this... space...

45:34.865 --> 45:37.834
it's one idea, I suppose,

45:37.836 --> 45:40.169
but, look, no one has ever
suffered in space,

45:40.171 --> 45:41.738
apart from aliens,

45:41.740 --> 45:43.806
and we can't relate to them.

45:43.808 --> 45:45.174
We can't.

45:45.176 --> 45:49.245
No, for food to mean anything
it's gotta be created in pain,

45:49.247 --> 45:51.180
possibly boiled in blood.

45:51.182 --> 45:52.448
I've tried it in the past,

45:52.450 --> 45:55.551
but I've struggled
with coagulation issues.

45:56.253 --> 45:57.587
You're getting all of this?

45:57.589 --> 45:58.955
Yeah, this is so great.

45:58.957 --> 46:01.324
Amazing. Amazing.
Where was I?

46:02.459 --> 46:04.026
Ah, yes, coagulation.

46:04.028 --> 46:07.330
So what I've found, I think,
is to offset the...

46:08.432 --> 46:09.632
Are you all right?

46:10.300 --> 46:12.769
Yeah, no, um...

46:13.170 --> 46:15.138
What do you think
about gentrification?

46:15.140 --> 46:16.672
It's definitely bad.

46:16.674 --> 46:19.041
But if you think about it,
anything that ends in "ation"

46:19.043 --> 46:20.676
is bad, you know?

46:20.678 --> 46:22.678
Industrialization...

46:23.747 --> 46:25.248
station...

46:26.116 --> 46:27.717
penetration.

46:28.485 --> 46:29.652
Oh no, that one's...
well, I suppose

46:29.654 --> 46:32.388
it could be bad or good
depending on the situation...

46:32.390 --> 46:34.490
yeah, definitely, um...

46:34.492 --> 46:36.492
Also, maybe
anti-gentrification,

46:36.494 --> 46:38.161
it's the new food?

46:38.163 --> 46:40.263
No, I think food
is still the new food.

46:40.265 --> 46:43.132
Yeah, but...

46:43.134 --> 46:48.004
Well, I'm just really feeling
these anti-gentrification vibes

46:48.006 --> 46:50.173
and I just think that food
is so next gen

46:50.175 --> 46:51.207
that it can wait for just...

46:51.209 --> 46:52.842
no, Laurie mills,
food can't wait!

46:52.844 --> 46:55.645
My food can't wait!
It's too important for that!

46:56.013 --> 46:57.914
Look, Nelson Mandela once said,
"you haven't lived

46:57.916 --> 46:59.649
until you've found something
worth dying for."

46:59.651 --> 47:03.719
My food is worth dying for,
okay?

47:05.589 --> 47:09.025
God... your hands are so strong.

47:11.161 --> 47:13.596
Frozen and silent,

47:13.598 --> 47:15.932
Leningrad refused to die.

47:16.400 --> 47:18.835
Bread was now made
with sweepings,

47:18.837 --> 47:21.437
cattle cake and sawdust.

47:22.372 --> 47:23.873
Over two and a half
million people

47:23.875 --> 47:25.875
were trapped in the city,

47:25.877 --> 47:28.744
over 400,000 of them children.

47:31.415 --> 47:34.617
People ate soap, linseed oil,

47:34.619 --> 47:36.786
the paste for wallpaper...

47:57.207 --> 47:59.508
"Saski-babes, totes adore
the charlatan thing,

47:59.510 --> 48:02.178
when you gave me the job
you promised me 100 percent

48:02.180 --> 48:04.847
editorial control to guarantee
Metro B's authenticity.

48:04.849 --> 48:07.316
I truly believe
in Harmony Ambrose."

48:07.318 --> 48:10.486
Hmm, not as vacuous
as we thought!

48:11.855 --> 48:13.055
Okay.

48:27.004 --> 48:30.072
By Laurie mills.

48:38.582 --> 48:41.384
By Laurie mills.

48:50.994 --> 48:52.228
What?

48:52.763 --> 48:54.497
What do you mean, a dongle?

48:54.499 --> 48:56.599
Ugh! Come on, help me!

48:58.869 --> 49:00.603
Hmm...

49:03.140 --> 49:05.942
Ah, come on, just help me out!

49:18.822 --> 49:20.856
Surprise!

49:24.761 --> 49:26.162
You look like shit.

49:33.837 --> 49:36.238
At least you remembered
it's Auden's birthday.

49:36.540 --> 49:38.274
That's something, isn't it?

49:38.575 --> 49:39.775
Yeah...

49:40.277 --> 49:42.111
Yeah, where is the birthday boy?

49:42.113 --> 49:45.114
Saskia's taken him to the floating
tots swimming experience.

49:45.116 --> 49:46.282
Ah!

49:46.616 --> 49:48.284
It's my life, by the way.

50:06.336 --> 50:07.970
I'm sorry, Sam.

50:08.839 --> 50:10.139
What are you sorry about?

50:11.708 --> 50:12.942
Everything.

50:16.580 --> 50:18.080
I...

50:18.082 --> 50:21.384
know it's been hard
since they died, but...

50:21.386 --> 50:23.786
you've got to stop
doing these mental things, Mel.

50:24.287 --> 50:25.821
There are other flats.

50:27.124 --> 50:29.258
Yeah, I know
it seems crazy, but...

50:29.926 --> 50:32.161
if she gets my flat, then...

50:32.163 --> 50:34.063
she gets my boy,
and she takes my life.

50:34.065 --> 50:35.331
You know,
I can't let that happen.

50:35.333 --> 50:36.832
Then come home,

50:36.834 --> 50:38.467
be with people who love you...

50:39.703 --> 50:41.103
and forget the flat.

50:41.805 --> 50:44.273
And, do you know what, you
should forget Harmony as well.

50:46.176 --> 50:47.843
You're doing the crying thing.

50:51.081 --> 50:53.149
Why do I lose everything, Sam?

50:54.484 --> 50:55.684
Oh, fucking hell.

50:57.988 --> 50:59.221
Come here.

51:00.991 --> 51:04.260
Oh, god, no, no, no, no, no.
Ah, this is silly.

51:04.262 --> 51:06.128
I'm just gonna clean myself up.

51:06.130 --> 51:08.931
- You okay?
- Yep, I'm fine! I'm fine.

51:28.018 --> 51:29.318
Hey, chicken pop!

51:29.320 --> 51:31.387
I forgot my dongley thingy.

51:31.389 --> 51:33.622
It's in, uh, my office.

51:34.758 --> 51:36.959
Ah, melody!
You gave me a fright!

51:36.961 --> 51:39.595
Yeah, I know, I was just
looking for the loo.

51:39.597 --> 51:41.197
Oh, really?

51:41.199 --> 51:43.966
It's downstairs, same as it was
when you grew up here.

51:44.468 --> 51:45.701
Yeah.

51:45.703 --> 51:47.903
Ah, here we go.

51:49.306 --> 51:50.606
Toodles.

51:55.846 --> 51:57.246
Toodles.

52:00.951 --> 52:02.651
Hello. Hello.

52:02.653 --> 52:06.055
Hello, darling, my name
is Saskia Armitage-Munro,

52:06.057 --> 52:07.289
don't you know.

52:07.291 --> 52:09.992
I work for Zeitline.
I work for the Zeitline.

52:09.994 --> 52:11.961
Well, I'm the main editor
of Zeitline.

52:11.963 --> 52:14.497
You know, one of the most
important magazines in London.

52:14.499 --> 52:17.867
Sammy! Sam.
Sammy, remember why we're here!

52:17.869 --> 52:21.137
Sam. Sam!

52:21.139 --> 52:22.605
Mmh.., mmh, toodles!

52:22.607 --> 52:24.473
Laurie, darling, love the fact

52:24.475 --> 52:27.443
you're Metro bitch now,
Zeitmost.

52:27.445 --> 52:29.678
Thing is, saskia, is that...

52:29.680 --> 52:32.581
I'm actually buying melody's
flat through charlatans,

52:32.583 --> 52:34.283
so, I mean,
wouldn't that look a bit odd?

52:34.285 --> 52:36.619
That's what makes it so perfect!

52:36.621 --> 52:39.221
It's life as lived on
the front line of hip London!

52:39.223 --> 52:41.457
When you make a stand
and don't buy the flat

52:41.459 --> 52:44.527
it'll be a real story,
reportage.

52:44.529 --> 52:47.663
So you want me
to push Harmony's food thing

52:47.665 --> 52:49.532
until next week?

52:49.534 --> 52:52.301
No, no food thing,
just charlatans.

52:52.303 --> 52:55.304
That's going to
hurt Harmony's feelings?

52:55.306 --> 52:57.540
He doesn't matter.
Just do it.

52:57.542 --> 53:00.843
Betrayal? Love it.
So next gen.

53:01.646 --> 53:03.646
Okay, toodles.

53:06.783 --> 53:08.284
Who was that, darling?

53:08.652 --> 53:10.152
So funny.

53:10.154 --> 53:12.421
Great story. Tell you later.
Super!

53:14.292 --> 53:15.457
Our ancestors in caves

53:15.459 --> 53:18.027
didn't eat for taste,
they ate to survive,

53:18.029 --> 53:21.163
and that is the kind of purity
of consumption that we need.

53:21.165 --> 53:23.899
My new pop-up
will have the need concept.

53:23.901 --> 53:27.870
Every meal will be served
by a Japanese Shinto priest

53:27.872 --> 53:30.072
holding a loaded gun
to your head,

53:30.074 --> 53:32.107
and that will
amplify the experience

53:32.109 --> 53:33.909
more than any flavor.

53:33.911 --> 53:37.513
It'll be like one plus one
equals... eight.

53:38.014 --> 53:40.950
A totally immersive
dining experience.

53:41.117 --> 53:43.118
Wow, that sounds great!

53:43.120 --> 53:44.820
Oh, it's better than great!

53:44.822 --> 53:46.789
Babe, it's a revolution.

53:46.791 --> 53:49.258
That's what me and Laurie have
been working on with this article.

53:50.493 --> 53:53.596
It's just amazing that this
is happening to me, you know?

53:54.197 --> 53:56.699
I feel like the luckiest guy
in the world.

53:59.336 --> 54:02.171
Um... you...

54:02.173 --> 54:03.772
Y-you're not hungry?

54:04.174 --> 54:05.941
Oh, no, I am, I'm starving.

54:07.344 --> 54:09.645
And this is amazing, you know.

54:10.247 --> 54:12.781
It's probably the best-tasting
food I've ever tried.

54:12.783 --> 54:17.553
But I shouldn't really be...

54:17.555 --> 54:18.887
What?

54:19.222 --> 54:21.824
Look, Laurie says I really need
to be 100 percent

54:21.826 --> 54:23.359
brand Harmony right now.

54:23.361 --> 54:25.527
And I've already got the
advantage of one word equity,

54:25.529 --> 54:29.698
you know, like Boris,
or Shano... Warne.

54:30.066 --> 54:31.500
But also live it, you know?

54:31.502 --> 54:35.838
Every day is literally a battle
against the tyranny of taste,

54:35.840 --> 54:39.008
this war of attrition
that I've got within myself.

54:39.010 --> 54:40.542
Basically, Laurie says
I've got to stop eating food

54:40.544 --> 54:42.144
that tastes nice.

54:44.281 --> 54:45.781
All good, babe?

54:47.417 --> 54:48.951
Do you wanna fuck?

54:49.586 --> 54:51.287
You do fuck still, don't you?

54:51.588 --> 54:52.888
Oh, yeah.

54:53.556 --> 54:55.157
I'm still Australian.

55:05.136 --> 55:06.669
Oh god, I love you.

55:06.671 --> 55:08.671
- I love you.
- I love you.

55:08.673 --> 55:11.407
- Yeah, and I love you.
- Oh, and I love you!

55:11.409 --> 55:15.311
I love you.
I love you and I love you.

55:15.313 --> 55:17.012
Are you talking to the flat?!

55:18.615 --> 55:20.049
No?

55:23.086 --> 55:24.486
Babe!

55:26.723 --> 55:28.590
Oh, god. Oh.

56:29.720 --> 56:31.353
He had nothing to do with him.

56:35.392 --> 56:37.025
Oh, my god.

56:37.660 --> 56:40.662
Well, melsy babes,

56:40.664 --> 56:42.097
here you are!

56:46.202 --> 56:48.971
Oh, and just look at Harmony.

56:49.973 --> 56:52.608
God, if I hadn't been
lumbered with Sam

56:52.610 --> 56:55.411
I'd be all over
that sexy Aussie bum.

56:55.413 --> 56:57.413
- That's a nice image.
- Oh, shut up, darling.

56:57.514 --> 56:58.947
You know I heart you.

57:02.585 --> 57:03.619
Hey.

57:03.621 --> 57:06.221
What has she put you in, eh?

57:06.223 --> 57:07.723
Yeah, I know.

57:07.991 --> 57:09.858
I feel exactly the same.

57:11.027 --> 57:12.528
So, we start with the greeting.

57:12.530 --> 57:14.062
- Yes.
- You think so?

57:14.064 --> 57:15.197
Uh, miss out that bit.

57:15.199 --> 57:16.732
Can I just-can I just
ask a question?

57:16.734 --> 57:18.133
Are we...
is this coming before that?

57:18.135 --> 57:19.902
This bit after.
Oh, look, look.

57:19.904 --> 57:21.036
He's worried.

57:21.038 --> 57:21.904
Oh, he's worried.

57:24.275 --> 57:25.607
Relax!

57:25.809 --> 57:28.677
That was a strange phone call,
wasn't it, melody?

57:28.679 --> 57:30.179
What phone call?

57:30.181 --> 57:32.014
Oh, you know the one.

57:32.016 --> 57:35.150
The one when you rang
pretending to be saskia.

57:36.986 --> 57:38.387
Dashing, dashing.

57:38.389 --> 57:39.888
Hi, hi. Thanks for coming.

57:41.157 --> 57:42.724
Harmony is
going to be heartbroken

57:42.726 --> 57:45.594
when I tell him after the
ceremony that you betrayed him.

57:45.596 --> 57:47.796
Why don't you just stop
making things up?

57:47.798 --> 57:50.132
Charlatans thing was
a nice idea, though.

57:50.700 --> 57:52.000
Bad luck.

57:54.004 --> 57:55.571
Why don't I take him?
I'm great with kids.

57:55.573 --> 57:57.840
Look, I'm fine.
I can hold a baby.

57:59.076 --> 58:01.443
I think it's probably best,
though, if I take him.

58:01.445 --> 58:04.480
Why don't you fuck off
and get your own fucking baby?!

58:08.551 --> 58:10.219
Uh, um...

58:10.221 --> 58:13.722
Why don't we see if you
can manage holding this?

58:15.058 --> 58:16.592
Hello!

58:16.594 --> 58:17.926
Yay.

58:17.928 --> 58:20.195
Is that better? Yes.

58:23.933 --> 58:25.667
Can you get
your fucking shit together

58:25.669 --> 58:28.337
and stop fucking swearing
in the fucking church?

58:28.339 --> 58:30.339
Shall we begin?

58:30.341 --> 58:32.007
Yes.

58:32.009 --> 58:35.444
Our lord Jesus Christ
has told us

58:35.446 --> 58:37.779
that to enter
the kingdom of heaven,

58:37.781 --> 58:40.616
we must repent our sins!

58:41.050 --> 58:42.985
For god so loved the world

58:42.987 --> 58:45.487
that he gave his only
begotten son

58:45.489 --> 58:48.457
so that whosoever believeth
in him

58:48.459 --> 58:50.926
shall not perish,
but have everlasting life!

58:50.928 --> 58:52.728
Hi! Hey!

58:52.996 --> 58:54.329
Speaking of life,

58:54.331 --> 58:56.098
that is why we are here!

58:56.432 --> 58:59.868
So, may I ask you to bring
the godparents forward?

58:59.870 --> 59:01.537
- Yes.
- Yes. All right.

59:07.944 --> 59:09.111
Cunt.

59:09.946 --> 59:11.914
And stop right there, yeah.

59:28.531 --> 59:29.765
Bingo.

59:48.485 --> 59:50.552
Have you seen Doris and Dave?

59:50.554 --> 59:52.054
Thanks for coming!

59:52.056 --> 59:53.889
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

59:53.891 --> 59:56.458
No, stop, stop.
Just fucking stop.

59:56.460 --> 59:57.492
I don't wanna hear.

59:57.494 --> 59:58.493
I took that by mistake.

59:58.495 --> 59:59.828
Mel, just go, okay?

59:59.830 --> 01:00:01.096
I don't wanna see you again

01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:02.931
until you pay me back
my child's money,

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:04.566
all of it.

01:00:05.668 --> 01:00:07.402
Um, where's Laurie?

01:00:07.404 --> 01:00:08.870
Why?

01:00:08.872 --> 01:00:11.607
A story she's written's
going bonkers on Twitter,

01:00:11.609 --> 01:00:13.208
"burn charlatans burn."

01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:16.244
God, that is so on trend.

01:00:16.546 --> 01:00:18.447
Oh, Laurie, have you seen this?

01:00:18.449 --> 01:00:20.449
You're such a clever girl!

01:00:20.451 --> 01:00:22.050
We've gone viral!

01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:24.386
- Sorry?
- "Burn charlatans burn."

01:00:24.388 --> 01:00:25.754
God, it's brilliant.

01:00:25.756 --> 01:00:27.456
Wow, Laurie,
how did you think of that?

01:00:28.825 --> 01:00:31.593
Oh, I suppose you'll
have to publicly refuse

01:00:31.595 --> 01:00:33.228
to buy the flat now.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:36.632
Oh! Oh, we could live-stream
her telling the agent!

01:00:36.634 --> 01:00:38.533
Yes, that's brilliant!

01:00:39.502 --> 01:00:41.637
I don't know about you, saskia,
but I'm really impressed

01:00:41.639 --> 01:00:43.538
that Laurie would be willing
to risk her relationship

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:45.807
with Harmony for the sake
of the right story.

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:47.909
I'm not sure I'd be able
to forgive someone

01:00:47.911 --> 01:00:49.311
who did that to me.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:53.615
Oh, this is perfect.

01:00:53.617 --> 01:00:56.018
You're such a clever
little angel.

01:00:57.687 --> 01:01:00.288
I'm tweeting piers Morgan now.

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:14.903
Charlatans is the new form
of Chinese cabbage.

01:01:18.575 --> 01:01:19.941
Actually, like,
speak up and say...

01:01:19.943 --> 01:01:21.276
fuck charlatans!

01:01:21.278 --> 01:01:23.245
I just know how to tuck a penis
up my bum.

01:01:26.083 --> 01:01:28.984
Heart Laurie mills.

01:01:29.852 --> 01:01:31.653
Laurie mills is the one.

01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:38.894
Ms. mills.

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:41.530
What's with the video?

01:01:41.532 --> 01:01:42.631
I have come to tell you

01:01:42.633 --> 01:01:44.466
that I think you're a cancer...

01:01:44.468 --> 01:01:46.301
eating away at society.

01:01:46.837 --> 01:01:54.476
You and your extensive range
of high-quality apartments...

01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:01.650
apartments is what is ruining
the local spirit of my area.

01:02:01.652 --> 01:02:04.619
You just bring in an influx
of wealthy,

01:02:04.621 --> 01:02:07.155
aspirational,
good-looking people,

01:02:07.157 --> 01:02:10.959
which, quite frankly,
I find disgusting!

01:02:10.961 --> 01:02:11.993
Hmm!

01:02:11.995 --> 01:02:13.695
But it's the market.

01:02:13.697 --> 01:02:15.664
People want to live
in this area.

01:02:15.666 --> 01:02:17.065
You want to live in this area!

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:18.834
How dare you, JP?!

01:02:18.836 --> 01:02:23.872
I will never, ever,
buy a property from you.

01:02:39.989 --> 01:02:43.024
Charlatans have taken our vibe!

01:02:43.026 --> 01:02:45.761
It's ruined
our warehouse parties

01:02:45.763 --> 01:02:47.796
and killed our street markets!

01:02:47.798 --> 01:02:51.633
But now it is time
to take our streets back!

01:02:55.505 --> 01:02:56.905
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

01:02:56.907 --> 01:03:03.011
Fuck you, charlatans!
Fuck you, charlatans!

01:03:03.346 --> 01:03:06.615
Woo-hoo! Woo!
Whoop! Whoop!

01:03:06.617 --> 01:03:08.383
Whoop! Whoop!
Whoop! Whoop!

01:03:09.486 --> 01:03:10.685
Yeah.

01:04:14.885 --> 01:04:16.451
Fuck!

01:04:19.389 --> 01:04:20.488
Oh, my god.

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:24.292
That was so inspirational, it's
given me an idea for a starter.

01:04:24.294 --> 01:04:25.427
Oh no, wait.

01:04:25.429 --> 01:04:27.162
Wait, I'm going to cook for you.

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:43.011
Babe, why are you throwing away
a picture of Laurie?

01:04:43.013 --> 01:04:44.045
What?

01:04:55.925 --> 01:04:57.559
Holy shit, it was you.

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:06.935
Just-just ignore that, babe.

01:05:07.403 --> 01:05:09.271
You set this whole thing up?

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:13.909
You knew it would ruin
my article.

01:05:13.911 --> 01:05:15.777
- I did it for us.
- No, you didn't.

01:05:17.246 --> 01:05:20.682
You want this flat so much,
you're welcome to it.

01:05:21.651 --> 01:05:24.953
You don't love me, I'm just
another thing to you like your...

01:05:26.155 --> 01:05:27.656
De'longhi.

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:32.694
- Where are you going?
- To find Laurie,

01:05:32.696 --> 01:05:34.195
someone who wants me to succeed.

01:05:34.197 --> 01:05:35.597
Well, Laurie doesn't want you
to succeed,

01:05:35.599 --> 01:05:37.499
she just wants your cock!

01:05:37.501 --> 01:05:39.534
Laurie mills actually cares
about my food!

01:05:39.536 --> 01:05:40.702
Oh, your food!

01:05:40.704 --> 01:05:43.238
The food is
pretentious bullshit!

01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:56.184
You still love me, don't you?

01:06:10.033 --> 01:06:11.232
Mmh.

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:55.737
Who is it?

01:07:55.971 --> 01:07:57.472
Melody Munro,

01:07:57.474 --> 01:08:01.076
Bailiffs collecting on behalf
of show me the Skrilla.

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:17.158
Are you letting us in?

01:08:19.627 --> 01:08:23.331
You sure?

01:08:25.067 --> 01:08:26.468
This hasn't happened before.

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:30.270
Just... just take it.

01:08:31.707 --> 01:08:33.140
Take it all.

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:39.080
It wasn't a heart attack,

01:08:39.082 --> 01:08:42.484
it was an irregular murmur
brought on by stress.

01:08:43.219 --> 01:08:45.752
In fact, saying
the words "heart attack"

01:08:45.755 --> 01:08:46.988
made me more stressed.

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:49.691
Apparently, my blood pressure
is the worst seen

01:08:49.693 --> 01:08:52.359
outside of Japanese
mid-level management,

01:08:52.362 --> 01:08:53.627
which is great.

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:57.698
The doctor's given me
this... heart rate thing.

01:08:57.701 --> 01:09:00.301
Okay, listen, I'm going to
stop you right there.

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:02.770
Look.

01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:09.042
I want you to sell the flat.

01:09:09.045 --> 01:09:10.645
I can't talk about the flat.

01:09:11.346 --> 01:09:15.015
Talking about the flat makes me
very uncomfortable and nervous.

01:09:15.018 --> 01:09:16.251
I need to remain calm.

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:19.921
I need to remain extremely calm.

01:09:19.923 --> 01:09:22.423
Okay, well I'm gonna move back
with my brother.

01:09:22.425 --> 01:09:23.825
And, Tommy...

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:25.760
I'm sorry.

01:09:29.466 --> 01:09:31.064
Fuck.

01:09:31.067 --> 01:09:32.901
Sorry.
Sorry, my heart's beating.

01:09:32.903 --> 01:09:34.868
Sorry. It's the emotion.

01:09:34.871 --> 01:09:36.037
Fuck.

01:09:36.038 --> 01:09:37.138
Suni!

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:40.073
Suni, fucking getting in here,
suni!

01:09:41.343 --> 01:09:43.011
Fuck. I'll see you later.

01:09:43.013 --> 01:09:44.179
Arh!

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:06.367
We're temporarily closed
at the moment,

01:10:06.369 --> 01:10:07.502
but you can still view

01:10:07.504 --> 01:10:10.338
our extensive
range of properties online!

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.906
It's melody.

01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:15.109
Step away
from this retail property!

01:10:15.111 --> 01:10:18.313
I have your keys.
You can have them.

01:10:26.455 --> 01:10:27.722
Wow.

01:10:29.358 --> 01:10:30.992
You're joking, yeah?

01:10:32.695 --> 01:10:34.495
To the Victor, the spoils.

01:10:38.801 --> 01:10:41.202
Come on, JP, let's get you
a celebratory drink.

01:10:41.204 --> 01:10:42.904
Glasses are over there.

01:10:44.974 --> 01:10:47.942
But... first probably
some water, eh?

01:10:47.944 --> 01:10:52.447
The... toy... factory.

01:10:55.117 --> 01:10:56.651
Ah, melody,

01:10:56.653 --> 01:10:58.219
fancy meeting you here!

01:10:58.221 --> 01:10:59.454
What are you doing?

01:10:59.456 --> 01:11:01.256
Burn charlatan burn!

01:11:01.258 --> 01:11:04.392
I wrote it, so now...

01:11:06.695 --> 01:11:08.696
I'm going to do it!

01:11:08.864 --> 01:11:11.899
Okay, glass, video record.

01:11:11.901 --> 01:11:15.203
Say my name.
I am the Metro bitch!

01:11:15.205 --> 01:11:19.274
Laurie... I wrote it...
You know that.

01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:23.778
Oh, melody,
you are funny sometimes!

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:25.380
This is really fucking serious.

01:11:25.382 --> 01:11:27.448
You're right, Mel,
it is really serious.

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:28.883
- Harmon...
- Mel, I found it.

01:11:28.885 --> 01:11:30.285
I've found the revolution.

01:11:30.287 --> 01:11:33.588
And, look, it'll cause
a little bit of pain,

01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:35.556
quite a lot of destruction,

01:11:35.558 --> 01:11:38.960
but from its ashes
a new world will arise,

01:11:38.962 --> 01:11:40.495
a better world,

01:11:40.497 --> 01:11:43.064
and I'll be the one
to capture that...

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:45.566
in a kebab.

01:11:45.568 --> 01:11:47.201
Okay, right, kids,
playtime is over.

01:11:47.203 --> 01:11:49.837
You can go to jail for this
stuff for a very long time.

01:11:49.839 --> 01:11:52.573
You can't stop me this time,
melody.

01:11:52.575 --> 01:11:56.277
Do you know that Bob Marley
once said,

01:11:56.279 --> 01:11:57.745
"you haven't lived

01:11:57.747 --> 01:11:59.714
until you've found
something worth dying for"?

01:11:59.716 --> 01:12:00.948
Nelson Mandela.

01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:05.153
Well, I... am... Bob Marley.

01:12:06.221 --> 01:12:08.423
Well, you can be Bob Marley
all you want,

01:12:08.425 --> 01:12:10.391
Harmony and me,
we're getting out of here.

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:12.760
- No!
- Come on, Harmony.

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:23.738
Do you know what?

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:25.206
You two...

01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:27.608
you deserve each other.

01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:31.646
She's always been
such a dull bitch.

01:12:32.748 --> 01:12:34.582
Let's burn this fucker!

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:50.431
Hey, Sam, it's me.

01:12:50.966 --> 01:12:52.433
I wanna move back home.

01:12:53.235 --> 01:12:55.770
You set this whole thing up?

01:12:56.004 --> 01:12:58.740
You've got to stop
doing these mental things...

01:13:02.177 --> 01:13:03.578
You set this whole thing up?

01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:07.949
You're playing with fire.

01:13:14.757 --> 01:13:16.357
No. You've got to stop.
No, wait.

01:13:16.359 --> 01:13:17.291
- Stand back, please!
- No, no, no!

01:13:17.293 --> 01:13:18.826
These guys, they are morons.

01:13:18.828 --> 01:13:21.362
It was me. I did it.
I burnt charlatans.

01:13:22.631 --> 01:13:24.031
Fuck you, melody!

01:13:24.033 --> 01:13:25.700
I burned charlatans

01:13:25.702 --> 01:13:28.736
and it's all here
on my Google glasses!

01:13:29.037 --> 01:13:30.438
You stand back!
I'm warning you!

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:31.806
Mel, I'm scared!

01:13:31.808 --> 01:13:33.374
- Where's JP?
- He's in the car!

01:13:33.376 --> 01:13:35.109
Laurie's gone nuts!

01:13:35.377 --> 01:13:39.046
We're non-violent, officer,
apart from arson!

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:52.994
You win.

01:13:52.996 --> 01:13:55.496
The attractive
loft conversion is yours.

01:13:55.498 --> 01:13:56.964
- JP, stop moaning!
- What?

01:13:56.966 --> 01:13:57.899
I think you've got work to do,

01:13:57.901 --> 01:13:58.733
and I think
you're gonna enjoy it.

01:13:58.735 --> 01:14:00.301
Come on!
What?

01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:04.639
JP! JP, tell them!

01:14:04.641 --> 01:14:06.340
Hello, officers.

01:14:06.342 --> 01:14:08.910
This woman is fucking crazy!

01:14:08.912 --> 01:14:10.711
I've had enough of this shit!

01:14:10.713 --> 01:14:12.780
I'm going back to Africa
to sell weapons.

01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:14.916
No, JP! You tell them
it was me.

01:14:14.918 --> 01:14:16.384
It was her.

01:14:16.386 --> 01:14:18.286
She's one crazy fucking bitch!

01:14:18.288 --> 01:14:20.388
No! It was me!

01:14:23.058 --> 01:14:24.625
Jesus Christ!

01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:25.860
Oh, god, that felt good.

01:14:25.862 --> 01:14:27.995
Right, lads, it's taser time!

01:15:17.713 --> 01:15:18.846
Thank you.

01:15:19.281 --> 01:15:20.681
All right, Jones?

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:21.782
Yeah, you know.

01:15:21.784 --> 01:15:23.584
How's anger management
classes going?

01:15:23.586 --> 01:15:24.986
Shit.

01:15:30.093 --> 01:15:31.125
That's nice, innit?

01:15:31.127 --> 01:15:32.894
Stop.

01:15:34.296 --> 01:15:35.596
How's my nephew?

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:37.899
Good. Really good.

01:15:38.333 --> 01:15:39.367
Did you get the money

01:15:39.369 --> 01:15:40.902
that I transferred over
for his birthday?

01:15:40.904 --> 01:15:41.536
Mm-hmm.

01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:47.441
So, only two weeks to go!

01:15:48.777 --> 01:15:50.511
Fucking hell,

01:15:50.513 --> 01:15:51.846
two weeks.

01:15:53.749 --> 01:15:55.650
See Laurie's campaign?

01:15:55.652 --> 01:15:57.985
What,
the free the charlatans one?

01:15:57.987 --> 01:15:59.220
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:01.222
She's been trying to get in
to do an interview.

01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:02.490
One good thing about prison,

01:16:02.492 --> 01:16:04.592
you can stop people
from visiting you.

01:16:04.594 --> 01:16:06.694
Well, she is a massive cunt.

01:16:07.162 --> 01:16:08.329
Yeah.

01:16:09.097 --> 01:16:11.532
Saskia has said if you wanna
do a column

01:16:11.534 --> 01:16:15.069
about being a posh girl in
prison there might be a slot!

01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:17.204
Ooh, yeah!

01:16:17.206 --> 01:16:18.706
Thanks.

01:16:19.141 --> 01:16:22.343
I was actually thinking of trying
some cooking when I get out...

01:16:22.945 --> 01:16:25.947
like a local restaurant
somewhere.

01:16:26.949 --> 01:16:29.617
And nothing with a theme
and not a fucking pop-up.

01:16:29.619 --> 01:16:31.719
I was actually quite
into the Nazi food.

01:16:34.323 --> 01:16:36.857
By the way, yeah, Tommy's back.

01:16:37.526 --> 01:16:39.193
I don't know, I thought maybe...

01:16:39.195 --> 01:16:40.595
you guys could...

01:16:40.829 --> 01:16:42.797
I'd still rather have
my old room back with you,

01:16:42.799 --> 01:16:43.731
if that's all right.

01:16:43.733 --> 01:16:45.499
That's fine. Of course.

01:16:45.501 --> 01:16:47.268
Good.

01:16:47.736 --> 01:16:49.036
Harmony sends his love.

01:16:49.038 --> 01:16:51.872
- Does he?
- No. Not really.

01:16:54.177 --> 01:16:55.576
Phew.

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:05.219
Oh, god.

01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:32.713
Welcome to guerrilla gourmet,
my new cooking show,

01:17:32.715 --> 01:17:35.116
where we're shooting here in...

01:17:35.717 --> 01:17:38.853
Where are we?
In Ukraine,

01:17:39.388 --> 01:17:41.322
and I'm cooking a flaming galah.

01:17:46.561 --> 01:17:47.662
Fuck.

01:17:47.664 --> 01:17:49.630
Ah, yes.

01:17:49.632 --> 01:17:51.165
Harmony, I see men in the trees.

01:17:51.167 --> 01:17:53.034
Just keep shooting, Anatoli.

01:17:53.036 --> 01:17:54.735
This is what this is all about.

01:17:54.737 --> 01:17:58.339
This is a cooking revolution
right here.

01:18:00.109 --> 01:18:02.343
Oh, fuck. Fuck!

01:18:02.345 --> 01:18:03.611
Oh, my leg.

01:18:03.613 --> 01:18:05.680
Anatoli...

01:18:05.747 --> 01:18:07.782
Anatoli, mate.

01:18:10.085 --> 01:18:12.153
I'll get the first aid kit.

01:18:13.388 --> 01:18:15.489
Anatoli, did we bring
the first aid kit?

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:24.432
I have seen the light!

01:18:24.434 --> 01:18:27.368
'Cause the anti-Christ
is coming too!

01:18:27.769 --> 01:18:30.705
He gonna be bringing
smite and retribution!

01:18:30.707 --> 01:18:34.208
Giant wasps, they be coming too!

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.513
Welcome to JP's aks!

01:18:39.515 --> 01:18:40.614
Today, we're gonna be selling

01:18:40.616 --> 01:18:42.750
the best fucking weapon
known to mankind!

01:18:42.752 --> 01:18:45.286
Fucking get some, baby! Yeah!

01:18:48.256 --> 01:18:51.392
Ladies and gentlemen, we've only
got 55 of these ak-47s left.

01:18:51.394 --> 01:18:52.827
We've got to get rid of them!

01:18:52.829 --> 01:18:54.361
You know, I don't wanna have to
put these in the trunk

01:18:54.363 --> 01:18:55.996
of my car when I leave here
and try and drop them off

01:18:55.998 --> 01:18:57.998
at a township somewhere, no!

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.400
These things have to go!

01:18:59.402 --> 01:19:00.634
There you go, baby.

01:19:00.636 --> 01:19:02.503
Do you wanna hold that
and show them how you shoot?

01:19:02.505 --> 01:19:06.173
Now, look at this.
Now, you just aim down.

01:19:06.175 --> 01:19:08.175
There you go, baby!
There you go!

01:19:08.177 --> 01:19:10.244
Get some! Fuck you!

01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:11.912
When you absolutely positively

01:19:11.914 --> 01:19:14.381
must kill every motherfucker
in the room,

01:19:14.383 --> 01:19:16.317
this is the only
weapon of choice.

01:19:16.319 --> 01:19:17.985
Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:19:17.987 --> 01:19:19.620
Yeah, we just sold
another five of those.

01:19:19.622 --> 01:19:21.956
You could shoot someone
about 1,000 yards with this

01:19:21.958 --> 01:19:23.858
and still take
their fucking arm off.

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:25.659
That's just
the way it works, eh!

01:19:25.661 --> 01:19:28.129
Now, this is the way I prefer
to... give me that there, baby.

01:19:28.131 --> 01:19:30.097
This is the way I prefer
to shoot, yeah?

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:32.166
You're gonna take these
and you're gonna fucking blow

01:19:32.168 --> 01:19:35.469
some fucking people's head off!
Yeah, like that!

01:19:35.471 --> 01:19:37.872
Fucking get some!
Fucking get some!

01:19:46.715 --> 01:19:47.615
And I said, you know,

01:19:47.617 --> 01:19:49.183
"cointreau is
for flambéing bananas,"

01:19:49.185 --> 01:19:50.584
but they were drinking it!

01:19:50.586 --> 01:19:52.419
Oh, goodness. Horrible!

01:19:52.421 --> 01:19:54.889
Well, to bring it back
to a conclusion,

01:19:54.891 --> 01:19:57.925
I think everything has gone
most satisfactorily,

01:19:57.927 --> 01:19:59.126
Mr. and Mrs. Munro,

01:19:59.128 --> 01:20:01.095
and I really don't have
any other questions.

01:20:01.097 --> 01:20:03.430
It just remains for me
to ask Auden

01:20:03.432 --> 01:20:06.433
if you have anything to add,
young man?

01:20:06.601 --> 01:20:08.102
Cunt.
