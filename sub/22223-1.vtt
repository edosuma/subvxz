WEBVTT

00:02.003 --> 00:03.459
Previously on Farscape.

00:03.462 --> 00:07.330
Crichton:
When I was a kid, I dreamed
of outer space.

00:09.385 --> 00:12.468
This ship is dead!

00:12.471 --> 00:15.087
The wormhole experiment
is over.

00:15.099 --> 00:19.513
Pilot:
Moya feels Talyn has earned the
right to be buried in the Sacred Space.

00:19.520 --> 00:23.138
D'Argo:
We all knew the time would come
when we'd split up.

00:23.149 --> 00:25.390
I'm coming with you.
-No, I'm sorry.

00:25.401 --> 00:27.392
Do you love John Crichton?

00:27.403 --> 00:30.440
Do you love Aeryn Sun?

00:30.448 --> 00:33.656
Then don't make me say goodbye
and don't make me stay.

00:33.659 --> 00:37.493
Aeryn is with child.

00:37.496 --> 00:39.703
Pilot, patch me through
to Aeryn.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.493
She is beyond our range,
Commander.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.330
Get a fix on her position.
We're going after her.

00:45.046 --> 00:46.377
Pilot ( over radio):
Commander! Stay clear...

00:46.380 --> 00:49.338
We're... being...
pulled in... Commander!

00:49.342 --> 00:51.628
(shouting through static)

00:53.429 --> 00:56.341
You have got to be kidding me.

01:09.695 --> 01:13.438
I know I seem a little
obsessed lately.

01:13.449 --> 01:15.986
But it's been a long time
since you rescued me.

01:15.993 --> 01:18.154
Are you hearing any of this?

01:18.162 --> 01:20.118
Pilot, if you're there.

01:20.122 --> 01:22.864
Almost out of fuel.
Need a little help.

01:23.918 --> 01:25.874
Look, I'm trying to apologize.

01:25.878 --> 01:28.585
I accept my friends aren't
coming back from the wormhole.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.581
You're on a beautiful old ship
and I can't leave you guys.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.379
So please let me back in.

01:34.387 --> 01:36.298
Yo, Your Ladyship!

01:36.305 --> 01:38.842
I'm sorry, Commander.

01:38.849 --> 01:41.386
I must have...

01:41.394 --> 01:43.259
dozed off.
-Dozed off.

01:43.271 --> 01:44.431
( chuckles )

01:44.438 --> 01:48.556
( Playing "1812 Overture")

01:48.567 --> 01:51.354
Faster, faster!
Allegro! Allegro!

01:51.362 --> 01:52.943
(humming along)

01:52.947 --> 01:55.404
Now bring in the horns!

01:55.408 --> 01:57.865
( both mimic horns playing )

01:57.868 --> 02:01.076
(music continues)

02:01.080 --> 02:06.245
Old Pilot:
There is a store of
krillian-alloy ore on Tier Seven which might...

02:06.252 --> 02:10.916
Oh, no, no. My module can't
process it without purification
and reduction.

02:10.923 --> 02:16.668
Then there's nothing aboard
that can facilitate you
r escape before we die.

02:16.679 --> 02:23.721
So few Leviathans are able to
end their physical existence
in this Sacred Space.

02:23.728 --> 02:31.100
Elack and I promised each other
this when we were joined over
350 cycles ago.

02:31.736 --> 02:33.647
I'm sorry.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.610
Well, could be worse.

02:35.614 --> 02:40.028
You don't roll in,
I'm dead long time ago.

02:40.036 --> 02:44.370
Besides, I've almost cracked
Wormholes for Dummies.

02:44.373 --> 02:46.659
Why would I stick around
after that?

02:46.667 --> 02:48.953
Hyahl

02:48.961 --> 02:50.497
( "1812 Overture"
continues playing )

02:53.341 --> 02:55.502
(Crichton humming along)

03:00.306 --> 03:07.269
Old Pilot:
John, sorry I didn't notice it
sooner, but there's a small craft approaching.

03:07.271 --> 03:10.104
("1812 Overture" continuing)

03:28.709 --> 03:31.917
(whirring )

03:31.921 --> 03:36.130
Old Pilot:
And Commander, it is
out of control.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.384
( crashing )

03:37.385 --> 03:38.625
(explosions)

03:38.636 --> 03:41.002
(musical finale playing )

03:41.013 --> 03:42.628
(explosions continue)

03:42.640 --> 03:44.756
( crashing )

03:50.648 --> 03:52.604
(sizzling, crackling )

03:52.608 --> 03:53.688
( music stops )

03:53.692 --> 03:56.149
(thumping)

03:56.153 --> 03:57.268
( explosion )

03:57.279 --> 03:59.986
(glass shattering )

03:59.990 --> 04:02.367
(electronic squeaking )

04:04.620 --> 04:05.530
Go fetch.

04:05.538 --> 04:07.699
(soft whirring )

04:08.749 --> 04:10.535
( metallic clattering )

04:20.177 --> 04:21.462
(grunts)

04:37.736 --> 04:40.978
If you are sober or sane
enough to understand,

04:40.990 --> 04:44.153
| suggest you aim that
behind you.

04:44.160 --> 04:47.527
The creatures following me
execute on sight.

04:50.291 --> 04:51.827
Ah...

04:53.127 --> 04:57.541
Now, what are you going
to do for me?

04:59.175 --> 05:00.585
(snons)

05:04.847 --> 05:08.840
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

05:08.851 --> 05:12.685
Three years ago I got shot
through a wormhole.

05:12.688 --> 05:14.553
I'm in a distant part
of the universe

05:14.565 --> 05:17.602
aboard this living ship of
escaped prisoners,

05:17.610 --> 05:18.645
my friends.

05:20.696 --> 05:22.607
I've made enemies.

05:22.615 --> 05:25.698
Powerful, dangerous.

05:25.701 --> 05:29.535
Now all I want is to
find a way home

05:29.538 --> 05:32.371
to warn Earth.

05:32.374 --> 05:37.459
Look upward and share
the wonders I've seen.

06:06.909 --> 06:08.274
This is a dying ship!

06:08.285 --> 06:10.867
There shouldn't be anyone
on board a dying ship.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.657
Absolutely correct, Tinkerbell.

06:12.665 --> 06:16.453
Okay, my turn. Who, what,
when, where, why and how?

06:16.460 --> 06:18.746
You must listen to me...
-Oh, no.

06:18.754 --> 06:20.585
No, no, I'm no good
at listening.

06:20.589 --> 06:24.173
My brain cannot tolerate
translator microbes.

06:24.176 --> 06:24.676
l'm...

06:27.721 --> 06:31.464
I must learn your language
through hearing it.

06:32.851 --> 06:35.718
This. The name, the word.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.344
Winona.

06:37.356 --> 06:38.812
My pulse pistol.

06:38.816 --> 06:40.397
(kissing)

06:41.735 --> 06:42.724
More words.

06:45.864 --> 06:50.073
They will be here soon and
you will be dead before
you see them.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.284
Module.

06:57.710 --> 06:58.870
Box.

06:58.877 --> 07:01.869
Workbench. Junk. More junk.

07:01.880 --> 07:02.915
Tools.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.915
Bulkhead. Ceiling. Floor.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.303
Shirt. Wine. Face...

07:08.304 --> 07:11.796
Your alphabet. In order.

07:11.807 --> 07:12.967
( laughs )

07:12.975 --> 07:16.217
God. Damn, that's been
a long time.

07:17.938 --> 07:21.897
( singing )
A-B-C-D-E-F-G...

07:21.900 --> 07:25.108
H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P...

07:25.112 --> 07:27.569
Q-R-S-T-U-V...

07:27.573 --> 07:29.655
W-X-Y-and-Z.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.944
Now I've sung my ABCs...
-Commander...

07:31.952 --> 07:33.408
Yeah? Hello?

07:33.412 --> 07:35.778
Another vessel approaches.
A much larger one.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.122
Can she Starburst?

07:39.126 --> 07:41.242
( laughs )

07:41.253 --> 07:43.869
You speak Pilot.

07:43.881 --> 07:45.337
Yes.

07:45.341 --> 07:47.332
Right. 'Course you do.

07:47.843 --> 07:49.925
Ah, no.

07:49.928 --> 07:52.010
Dying ship, remember?
No Starburst.

07:52.014 --> 07:54.676
Muerta. Dead. Toast.

07:54.683 --> 07:57.766
Make sentences. Nouns. Verbs.

07:57.770 --> 07:59.931
Okay.

07:59.938 --> 08:03.066
Once upon a time,
l was happy here.

08:03.067 --> 08:05.149
A little on the lonely side,
but that's okay 'cause at least

08:05.152 --> 08:07.484
Winona only had to start
cooking fires.

08:07.488 --> 08:09.979
You know, fire. Whoosh, fire.

08:09.990 --> 08:14.780
Module's out of fuel,
so it's not going anywhere.

08:14.787 --> 08:17.995
So, I'm working like a mo'fo.

08:17.998 --> 08:22.412
And everything is finally coming
together on these crates here,

08:22.419 --> 08:26.913
till you smash through,
pissing me off

08:26.924 --> 08:29.882
just a little bit.

08:33.013 --> 08:36.255
See, the only thing that I
still had going for me,

08:36.266 --> 08:39.224
you just destroyed, lady. Yeah!

08:39.228 --> 08:43.847
The Grudeks will shock the
hull, incapacitating most
functioning.

08:44.358 --> 08:45.518
Ram...

08:45.526 --> 08:47.608
Wh-Wh-What about the Pilot?

08:47.611 --> 08:49.693
Muerta Pilot?
Muerta, muerta Pilot?

08:49.697 --> 08:51.562
No Pilot muerta.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.859
No, they need her alive to
harvest the toubray tissue.

08:57.663 --> 08:59.779
(shrieking)

08:59.790 --> 09:04.625
We need an enclosed space.
Self-contained circulation.

09:04.628 --> 09:06.960
They are going to fumigate!

09:06.964 --> 09:07.874
(hissing)

09:09.800 --> 09:11.961
(whimpering)

09:11.969 --> 09:14.802
(yelling)

09:21.812 --> 09:26.556
Crichton:
Grudeks. Grudeks.
God, I love 'em.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.398
Who the hell are they?

09:28.402 --> 09:30.814
Toubray hunters.

09:31.613 --> 09:32.898
You got a quick ear.

09:34.992 --> 09:38.655
Toubray is Leviathan neural
cluster tissue.

09:38.662 --> 09:42.154
Many cultures consume it to
enhance higher brain function.

09:42.166 --> 09:43.781
And you were with 'em?

09:43.792 --> 09:47.330
Till I fled for my life.

09:47.337 --> 09:51.000
That's going to be your song,
if you don't give me
an explanation.

09:51.008 --> 09:52.293
( device beeps )

09:52.301 --> 09:54.758
Ah! No touchy.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.965
The organization I work for was
hired to find Leviathans.

10:00.976 --> 10:06.312
l was given half a cycle to
become an expert on their
functions and their habits.

10:06.315 --> 10:08.601
So you can cut 'em
up into sushi.

10:08.609 --> 10:12.852
Why do you think I've worked
so hard to find the
Sacred Death Space?

10:12.863 --> 10:15.320
'Cause old Leviathans are
easier targets?

10:15.324 --> 10:20.159
And the toubray is richer with
age, so the Grudeks are happy.

10:20.162 --> 10:24.371
But my reasoning is this
Leviathan is near dead anyway.

10:24.374 --> 10:29.368
Harvesting it is better than
killing a healthy creature and
everyone on board.

10:29.379 --> 10:34.339
So, you Jacques Cousteau your
way upstream to where they die.

10:36.178 --> 10:38.885
At least you've thought
about it.

10:41.600 --> 10:48.062
Scorpius:
Your capacity for
self-delusionment astounds even me,

10:48.065 --> 10:50.602
and I live inside your
curdled brain.

10:50.609 --> 10:55.569
Hey man, you don't like the
Baywatch thing, head inland.

10:55.572 --> 10:59.861
How many men have a goal,
a challenge?

10:59.868 --> 11:02.530
A destiny as clear as yours?

11:02.538 --> 11:05.371
Stay focused on the riddle
of the wormholes.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.660
Affect the things you can.

11:10.963 --> 11:13.375
Satisfy yourself, John.

11:13.382 --> 11:13.996
Sno-cone?

11:17.427 --> 11:19.759
Ah, yeah. Cherry.

11:21.974 --> 11:24.010
Aeryn:
He's right, you know.

11:28.063 --> 11:30.054
Tell me again.

11:30.065 --> 11:32.522
Why did you leave?

11:34.486 --> 11:36.977
You assume that the answer
is going to be different

11:36.989 --> 11:40.356
from the other thousand times
you've asked the question.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.358
"Because" is not an answer.

11:50.419 --> 11:53.126
I'm not right for you, John.

11:53.130 --> 11:55.542
I was just the best of
limited choices.

11:57.009 --> 11:59.216
That's my kid, you know.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.210
That's Crichton's kid.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.212
This is my child.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.974
Whatever.

12:07.978 --> 12:11.516
Extraction party secure.
Breathable atmosphere.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.309
Heir to Command report?

12:13.317 --> 12:15.148
Awaiting, Warlord.

12:15.152 --> 12:20.237
Scout the region.
Identify additional prey.
Await my summons.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.071
As you command. Good hunting.

12:32.169 --> 12:37.163
5,000 crindars for whoever
locates the Y'tal Cavity!

12:37.174 --> 12:38.254
( cheering )

12:38.258 --> 12:41.375
And a thousand more for
the female corpse!

12:43.013 --> 12:44.753
Crichton:
Come on, Pilot. Snap to.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.175
Come on.

12:46.183 --> 12:48.094
(groaning)

12:48.101 --> 12:51.013
Just boost fluid to
her hydrex gland.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.431
(groaning loudly)

12:55.442 --> 12:57.103
Shh!

12:57.110 --> 12:59.897
We have bad guys on board.

12:59.905 --> 13:01.270
Can you space 'em?

13:01.281 --> 13:03.397
Old Pilot:
Elack is still dazed.

13:03.408 --> 13:07.651
I have virtually no systems
at my disposal.

13:07.663 --> 13:11.121
I recommend you save yourselves.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.409
What about you?

13:12.417 --> 13:14.203
Old Pilot:
We are old.

13:14.211 --> 13:17.920
We must accept our time
is soon anyway.

13:17.923 --> 13:24.670
Perhaps in passing we can serve
some purpose for others.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.171
She's the Mother Theresa of
the Uncharted Territories.

13:27.182 --> 13:30.299
Look, you don't mind if we
fight for you, do you?

13:30.310 --> 13:32.926
Do you have any DRDs
left with weapons?

13:32.938 --> 13:35.805
(distant voices approaching )

13:37.192 --> 13:40.150
Can we negotiate with
these guys?

13:40.153 --> 13:42.405
That is not their way.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.408
Grudeks my ass!

13:45.409 --> 13:47.320
It's time for a show of force.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.283
If we had any.

13:50.288 --> 13:52.540
(speaking alien language)

13:52.541 --> 13:55.032
Didn't get that one, did you?
'Cause it's Klingon.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.749
Time for you guys to clear out!

13:56.753 --> 13:59.335
There is no quarrel with you!

13:59.339 --> 14:01.580
Remain clear and you may live!

14:01.591 --> 14:02.967
Oh, no.

14:02.968 --> 14:05.710
No, not if you destroy my ship.

14:05.721 --> 14:07.803
Flee then.

14:07.806 --> 14:09.216
l award safe passage.

14:09.224 --> 14:12.512
Crichton:
Ha, you know what?
Flip that around.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.475
You got 60 microts to...

14:17.816 --> 14:21.900
It's a show of force.
It's the only thing that
Klingons understand.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.290
Make them think you're dead.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.621
Okay, Sputnik.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.210
No.

14:41.214 --> 14:44.126
You missed!

14:44.134 --> 14:47.467
( laughing )
Release the Brindz Hound!

14:49.181 --> 14:50.637
Hound?

14:51.767 --> 14:53.007
( barks )

14:53.018 --> 14:54.508
What are we talking,
tracking dog?

14:54.519 --> 14:55.554
Blood hunter.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.098
How big?

14:57.105 --> 14:58.345
What?!

14:58.356 --> 14:59.607
Look, you see this?

14:59.608 --> 15:01.394
ltty-bitty doggie ain't
gonna like it.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.892
There should be a pressure
hatch here to a crawl
space between...

15:03.904 --> 15:05.895
Hamman side, two tiers up.

15:05.906 --> 15:08.898
No, no, Leviathan schematics
clearly indicate that
the ship...

15:08.909 --> 15:10.900
Schematics? What schematics?

15:10.911 --> 15:13.197
I thought you were an expert.

15:13.205 --> 15:14.365
lam.

15:14.372 --> 15:16.328
I found the burial space.

15:16.333 --> 15:19.291
There should be a hatchway
and it should be here.

15:19.294 --> 15:25.711
Every Leviathan grows to
accommodate its passengers,
its pilot's whim, its...

15:26.384 --> 15:27.214
Oh, my goodness.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.799
You've never been on one
before, have you?

15:31.807 --> 15:34.264
You can't learn Leviathans in
the library. Hamman side.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.770
(distance howling )

15:37.771 --> 15:39.636
All right.

15:39.648 --> 15:40.933
None of the doors work?

15:40.941 --> 15:43.353
Because it's a dying ship.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.941
( growls )

15:46.822 --> 15:48.483
Nice puppy.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.366
Okay.

15:50.367 --> 15:51.482
Stick with me. You'll be...

15:51.493 --> 15:53.950
o... kay.

16:00.669 --> 16:03.285
Shift your gravity center.
Hurry!

16:03.296 --> 16:04.877
Do what?

16:06.424 --> 16:07.379
( growls )

16:07.384 --> 16:09.500
( screams )

16:13.098 --> 16:15.089
This is big.

16:15.100 --> 16:18.263
Obviously you need to
get out more.

16:19.855 --> 16:21.811
Is it torn bad?

16:21.815 --> 16:23.100
No.

16:23.108 --> 16:25.440
But it's the largest vein
I've ever seen.

16:25.443 --> 16:27.479
Yeah, it supplies blood
to my leg.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.398
It lets me move faster,
run away.

16:29.406 --> 16:31.397
Obviously it needs
to be bigger.

16:31.408 --> 16:33.899
It needs to be smaller.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.492
Everything smaller, lighter.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.452
Otherwise you'll never be able
to shift your gravity center.

16:38.456 --> 16:41.914
lwouldn't need to shift my
damn gravity center if it
wasn't for you.

16:41.918 --> 16:43.783
What happened between
you and the Grudeks?

16:43.795 --> 16:45.296
Why did you run away?

16:45.297 --> 16:47.288
ldon't think that is anything
you need to know.

16:47.299 --> 16:48.288
( groans )

16:50.302 --> 16:53.294
Sputnik, we don't work
together, we die.

16:53.305 --> 16:56.012
That's all the need-to-know
I need to know.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.841
lwas...

16:59.853 --> 17:03.061
too good.

17:03.064 --> 17:07.433
A simple Leviathan travel route
was all they expected.

17:07.444 --> 17:10.231
By finding the
Sacred Burial Space,

17:10.238 --> 17:13.651
with mature toubray flesh, l...

17:14.451 --> 17:16.362
l sabotaged myself.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.985
Right, they didn't want you
to tell anybody.

17:18.997 --> 17:22.080
My loss counts as breach.

17:22.083 --> 17:25.325
They won't even have to pay
fees to my organization.

17:25.337 --> 17:26.702
Somebody sign that contract.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.295
Kinda' makes me wanna
kill you myself.

17:29.299 --> 17:32.632
I think if you wait,
they will do that for you.

17:32.636 --> 17:37.005
We climb two levels higher and
begin searching anew.

17:39.976 --> 17:42.513
How do you know they'll
come this way?

17:42.520 --> 17:44.260
The lights are still on.

17:44.272 --> 17:46.388
The air is still circulating.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.776
They have not found the
Y'tal cavity yet.

17:48.777 --> 17:52.361
The what?

17:52.364 --> 17:57.700
The richest, most prized
toubray comes from Leviathan's
very first neural cell.

17:57.702 --> 17:59.988
Defleshing it shorts out
everything else.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.782
1812, gun.

18:04.334 --> 18:07.121
This is a very nice profession
you've chosen.

18:07.128 --> 18:08.743
Thank you.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.417
The conductivity tests
indicate upper quadrant.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.961
Warlord, this next location
brings us much closer.

18:13.969 --> 18:16.426
Ambush time. Stay quiet.

18:16.429 --> 18:19.136
Chiana (over Comm):
Crichton?

18:19.140 --> 18:21.472
I know you're here.

18:21.476 --> 18:23.762
Rygel and l are staring at
your pewnkah module...
-Shh!

18:23.770 --> 18:25.726
in this wreck of a
Maintenance Bay?

18:25.730 --> 18:27.436
Rygel:
Crichton!

18:27.440 --> 18:28.520
Chiana:
Where's Moya?

18:28.525 --> 18:29.605
Turn it off.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.849
Chiana:
Where are you?

18:37.617 --> 18:42.361
Center Chamber, as I recall.
No exit!

18:43.540 --> 18:45.121
They know we're here.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.411
Oh, nothing gets by
you, does it?

18:50.547 --> 18:52.629
Wait.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.590
Sikozu Shanu.

18:56.219 --> 18:58.710
Warlord llkog.

18:58.722 --> 19:03.432
I seek your tolerance with a
pledge never to tell anyone
about this place.

19:03.435 --> 19:05.892
As certain...

19:05.895 --> 19:08.307
when you are dead.

19:10.066 --> 19:16.153
Now, I know that once you had
an amnesty, you were going
to mention my name,

19:16.156 --> 19:17.521
right?

19:18.616 --> 19:19.480
(cocking guns)

19:19.492 --> 19:21.574
Grudeks, wait!

19:21.578 --> 19:24.115
Your, uh... earlier offer?

19:24.122 --> 19:26.613
The "run away" program.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.034
We'll take it.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.327
Grudeks,

19:32.339 --> 19:34.170
when they reach the corner,

19:34.174 --> 19:37.132
all fire as one.

19:41.056 --> 19:42.296
1812!

19:44.142 --> 19:45.552
Sikozu:
This way!

19:45.560 --> 19:47.266
Shoot them!

19:57.364 --> 19:59.400
( screaming )

20:05.580 --> 20:09.539
If Psycho-zoo let these
slijnots aboard, then why are
we keeping her alive?

20:09.542 --> 20:12.033
Pip, cut her some slack. She
just had her hand ripped off.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.910
And you haven't seen Moya?

20:13.922 --> 20:16.413
I told ya, Sparky.
She got swallowed.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.540
Well, our pod's not
going anywhere.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.712
We were lucky to get this far.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.462
(squabbling)

20:23.473 --> 20:24.508
Chiana.

20:24.516 --> 20:27.053
What the hell's the
matter with you?

20:27.060 --> 20:28.300
With me?

20:28.311 --> 20:29.551
Yeah, you.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.269
What's the matter with me?
-You.

20:32.273 --> 20:35.561
Hey Ryg, how 'bout you tell
Crichton what's the
matter with me?

20:35.568 --> 20:37.650
Why are you shaving now?

20:37.654 --> 20:39.019
(metal scraping )

20:40.532 --> 20:43.274
You're what's the matter
with me, Crichton.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.321
You.

20:45.328 --> 20:46.568
Always...

20:46.579 --> 20:48.695
you.

20:48.706 --> 20:52.824
An unprecedented reward is
offered for information
leading...

20:52.836 --> 20:54.451
(tape winding)

20:54.462 --> 20:59.331
...dead or alive price of five
million currency pledges

20:59.342 --> 21:03.381
rests on the Nebari Chiana,
who was last seen...

21:03.388 --> 21:04.673
( holograph stops )

21:04.681 --> 21:05.921
They're everywhere.

21:05.932 --> 21:09.470
In every bar, every port,
every ship that can fly.

21:09.477 --> 21:10.717
Hey!

21:11.980 --> 21:14.938
We had nowhere to go but here.
And all because of you.

21:14.941 --> 21:18.058
I'm worth seven million.
That's frelling with
her head, too.

21:18.069 --> 21:19.149
Hey,Toad!

21:19.154 --> 21:20.894
( Rygel shudders)

21:23.199 --> 21:24.735
Why are you shaving now?

21:24.742 --> 21:26.903
I finally figured out
wormholes.

21:26.911 --> 21:30.574
You did it? All that wormhole
nonsense we put up with?

21:30.582 --> 21:33.039
Yeah, I can get you home.

21:33.042 --> 21:35.875
If I knew where home was.
Or where we are.

21:35.879 --> 21:37.710
Or where the wormhole
network is.

21:37.714 --> 21:40.330
Yeah, and if we weren't trapped
with only two weapons,
about to die.

21:40.341 --> 21:44.004
Well, good new is, who
better to save a Leviathan
than us, huh?

21:44.012 --> 21:45.843
Hmm!

21:45.847 --> 21:50.011
So, we stay away from doggie,
we find the Grudeks and we
bring them down.

21:50.018 --> 21:50.973
So.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.433
Go get it.

21:52.437 --> 21:54.769
Yeah, she says her flesh
will rebond.

21:54.772 --> 21:56.603
So Ryg, you go fetch her hand.

21:56.608 --> 21:57.597
Pip, you're with me.

21:58.902 --> 22:00.267
Why me?

22:02.780 --> 22:05.692
Severed heads, severed hands.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.907
It's a motif.

22:09.871 --> 22:12.704
Get rid of the animal.
How hard can that be?

22:12.707 --> 22:14.823
You saw Sikozu's hand,
or lack thereof?

22:14.834 --> 22:15.949
Yeah, and I saw her.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.827
Don't confuse us.

22:22.717 --> 22:23.672
Hey!
( screams )

22:25.929 --> 22:29.171
All right, let's talk about it.

22:29.182 --> 22:31.343
Whatever it is.

22:31.351 --> 22:32.887
(panting)

22:32.894 --> 22:35.761
You know th-those visions
l was having?

22:35.772 --> 22:37.478
Yeah.
-Yeah, well they evolved.

22:37.482 --> 22:40.349
Into what?
(yells )

22:40.360 --> 22:44.524
(panting)

22:44.531 --> 22:45.941
There's a...

22:45.949 --> 22:49.066
there's a cheat proof game
at the casinos.

22:51.246 --> 22:55.330
A... A mercury droplet,
it bounces off an ion stream.

22:55.333 --> 22:58.166
And there's a thousand
different outcomes. -Whatever.

22:58.169 --> 22:59.579
You've won?

22:59.587 --> 23:02.829
Seven times. In a row.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.376
They arrested me, they
took my winnings...

23:04.384 --> 23:06.124
They...

23:06.135 --> 23:07.671
they had a little fun and...

23:07.679 --> 23:09.886
and a little torture.
Nothing... nothing new.

23:09.889 --> 23:13.131
On the upside, you're
not crazy.

23:13.142 --> 23:15.269
You see the future.

23:15.270 --> 23:17.852
That's what's so weird. I...

23:17.855 --> 23:20.892
I see the present.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.107
Only it's just so...

23:23.111 --> 23:25.397
it... it slows down.

23:26.781 --> 23:28.817
So, what's the bad?

23:28.825 --> 23:31.988
Blinding headaches afterwards.

23:31.995 --> 23:36.534
It's... It's like my eyes,
they... they get all used up,
and I... I can't see.

23:36.541 --> 23:38.031
And...

23:38.042 --> 23:43.787
and... and each time it
happens, it... it lasts longer.

23:43.798 --> 23:46.915
We get out of here, we find
someone to fix it.

23:46.926 --> 23:50.464
Before then, we got to find a
way to screw the pooch.

23:50.471 --> 23:54.009
Now, I'm going to need a rope,
a rabbit and a membrane.

23:55.435 --> 23:57.391
Ropes are mine.

23:57.395 --> 23:59.226
Rest is yours.

24:01.941 --> 24:04.557
Crichton, I'm as near
as I can get.

24:04.569 --> 24:05.775
They're still down here.

24:08.823 --> 24:10.779
(tools hissing)

24:13.286 --> 24:16.119
llkog:
Grudek!

24:16.122 --> 24:19.865
This cell is not Y'tal!

24:19.876 --> 24:22.117
But we are near!

24:22.128 --> 24:26.121
Up one, over one!

24:30.094 --> 24:32.380
(Aeryn groans)
(Crichton laughs)

24:32.388 --> 24:35.346
There it is.
That's a Crichton kick.

24:35.350 --> 24:36.556
Boy.

24:36.559 --> 24:38.800
Yeah, girls do kick harder.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.928
Uh... maybe it's not
mine at all.

24:43.024 --> 24:45.515
You just won't let that
rest, will you?

24:45.526 --> 24:48.859
Ah, maybe it's got
a little ponytail and
a teeny-tiny goatee.

24:48.863 --> 24:51.149
Maybe.
-Maybe it has half a
metal face on it.

24:51.157 --> 24:55.821
Maybe.
-Maybe it's a royal pain in the
ass, eats all the time and farts a lot.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.989
Then we'll know it's yours.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.112
(sighs)

25:01.876 --> 25:04.367
Aw, no...

25:04.379 --> 25:06.415
that's a Crichton kick.

25:06.422 --> 25:08.037
(sighs)

25:17.684 --> 25:20.847
Huh, still obsessed, I see.

25:22.563 --> 25:25.179
I'm not obsessed.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.022
Did she say anything to you
before she left?

25:27.026 --> 25:30.439
Goodbye, good luck,
good riddance.

25:30.446 --> 25:31.856
( chuckles )

25:31.864 --> 25:34.116
That's what you said.
And I'm not obsessed.

25:34.117 --> 25:37.985
Oh, wormholes, Aeryn, Earth

25:37.995 --> 25:40.452
Aeryn, Scorpius, Aeryn...

25:40.456 --> 25:41.536
( chuckles )

25:41.541 --> 25:43.247
I'm out of fingers.

25:43.251 --> 25:45.458
Want me to keep counting
on hers?

25:47.255 --> 25:48.745
Aeryn...

25:48.756 --> 25:51.463
(sighs)

25:52.719 --> 25:54.300
She say anything to you
before she left?

25:54.303 --> 25:58.888
Oh, Crichton! For once, listen.

25:58.891 --> 26:03.009
When a woman, whether she's
your wife, your lover

26:03.020 --> 26:06.148
or a slave you've purchased
to be your wife or lover,

26:06.149 --> 26:11.860
leaves you repeatedly,
take a hint.

26:11.863 --> 26:14.980
Well, that was the plan, but...

26:14.991 --> 26:17.573
you know how my plans go.

26:21.372 --> 26:24.614
The bargain is struck.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.161
Can't say I'm surprised.

26:27.128 --> 26:28.538
(giggles )

26:29.881 --> 26:31.917
You have ruined it.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.209
( groans )

26:37.805 --> 26:39.545
( groans )

26:41.225 --> 26:43.602
(grunting and groaning)

26:46.189 --> 26:47.599
(panting)

26:59.619 --> 27:00.904
( screaming )

27:00.912 --> 27:02.448
Crichton:
Enough.

27:02.455 --> 27:03.661
Enough!

27:03.664 --> 27:05.575
Look at what she did!
-Look what she did!

27:05.583 --> 27:07.414
Rygel:
Back!

27:07.418 --> 27:12.003
Freaky made a deal with rotting
flesh over there, and he
tried to kill me.

27:12.006 --> 27:14.713
Because she shot at him first!

27:14.717 --> 27:15.957
You see what that is?

27:15.968 --> 27:18.380
You know what that is?
Come on. Tell me.

27:18.387 --> 27:21.003
Crindars. Scarran currency.

27:21.015 --> 27:22.255
Chiana:
You betcha.

27:22.266 --> 27:25.429
And you know, you know
where he got it from?

27:25.436 --> 27:26.937
Her.

27:26.938 --> 27:29.930
Nebari, Hynerian and you.

27:29.941 --> 27:31.727
All from the Peacekeeper realm.

27:31.734 --> 27:34.897
What kind of currency do you
have in your pocket?!

27:34.904 --> 27:36.235
Pip, you think she's a Scarran?

27:36.239 --> 27:38.651
No, of course I'm not.

27:38.658 --> 27:43.527
I'm Kalish and we hate the
Scarran but I did grow up in
their territory, yes.

27:44.747 --> 27:46.738
So, uh, what was the plan?

27:49.752 --> 27:51.083
This.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.086
Bloodless.

27:54.090 --> 27:56.046
I bet you know what
that is, too.

27:58.177 --> 28:01.135
It's a Nebular Pod for
a flight racer.

28:01.138 --> 28:02.298
(shrieks)

28:02.306 --> 28:04.968
He liked me.

28:04.976 --> 28:08.013
I bought us an escape vehicle.

28:08.020 --> 28:13.014
After they left, he was going
to leave his ship behind
so we could live.

28:18.114 --> 28:20.821
(gasping)

28:24.453 --> 28:28.196
They have found the
Y'tal Cavity.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.198
This ship will be dead soon.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.370
Us shortly thereafter.

28:34.213 --> 28:39.628
So, what was your plan?

28:39.635 --> 28:42.297
( screaming )

28:42.305 --> 28:45.638
Rygel:
An open hatchway.
Why aren't we sucked out?

28:45.641 --> 28:47.256
Ask her.

28:47.268 --> 28:51.807
The Pilot is using the
Leviathan's mass to generate an
electrostatic membrane.

28:51.814 --> 28:54.271
One puncture and va-vooosh!

28:54.275 --> 28:56.015
Chiana:
That's totally insane.

28:56.027 --> 28:59.110
You did not run into
the Brindz Hound.

28:59.113 --> 29:02.196
We will never get close enough
to stop them while it is loose.

29:02.199 --> 29:04.815
(loud rumbling)

29:04.827 --> 29:07.694
And that means they're
harvesting toubray now.

29:07.705 --> 29:10.572
Crichton:
You guys, go find the
Slaughterhouse Five.

29:10.583 --> 29:12.244
Make sure we're ready to move.

29:12.251 --> 29:13.491
I'm not going with her.

29:13.502 --> 29:14.833
Pip.
-Please.

29:14.837 --> 29:18.204
She knows Leviathans
better than we do.

29:18.215 --> 29:20.547
All right, you go first, in
case I have to shoot you.

29:20.551 --> 29:22.758
I'll keep Pilot alert.

29:22.762 --> 29:24.627
Oh no, Sparky. She's fine.

29:24.639 --> 29:27.096
You got a job. You ever hear
of "rabbit to the hound"?

29:29.226 --> 29:30.090
( chuckles )

29:32.605 --> 29:34.220
(grunts)

29:34.231 --> 29:36.893
(Brindz hound growling)

29:36.901 --> 29:38.516
All right, we should split up.

29:38.527 --> 29:40.563
Wait, you go...

29:40.571 --> 29:43.654
Chiana, I told you I can go
places you cannot.

29:43.658 --> 29:45.865
I'd love to send you
to one myself.

29:45.868 --> 29:49.702
Sarcasm: the hallmark
of the subeducated.

29:49.705 --> 29:52.913
The only hallmark you're going
to be is a small, small
smudge in the wall

29:52.917 --> 29:54.578
after I shoot you.

29:54.585 --> 29:56.086
I told you...

29:56.087 --> 29:59.705
I can go places you cannot.

29:59.715 --> 30:03.207
(distant growling)

30:03.219 --> 30:08.805
Oh, he has absolutely no
appreciation of my worth
in a crisis.

30:08.808 --> 30:09.797
(loud growling)

30:09.809 --> 30:11.970
(gasps, yelling)

30:12.687 --> 30:14.552
( shivering )

30:14.563 --> 30:18.556
Let him find his own
frelling hound.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.182
( guttural growl )

30:20.194 --> 30:21.149
(gasps )

30:24.490 --> 30:27.857
( low growling continues)

30:29.912 --> 30:31.652
( guttural growl )

30:33.332 --> 30:34.162
(flatuating )

30:36.419 --> 30:38.159
(vicious growl )

30:38.170 --> 30:40.206
(whimpering)

30:44.301 --> 30:46.212
It's beautiful. You're Picasso.

30:46.220 --> 30:47.255
(kissing air)

30:47.263 --> 30:50.130
All right, I want you
to go hide.

30:50.141 --> 30:53.224
Run away. It's gonna be ugly.
You don't wanna see this.

30:53.227 --> 30:55.343
It's dinnertime.

30:56.731 --> 30:58.471
( groans )

31:00.317 --> 31:02.808
( baaing )

31:05.740 --> 31:08.322
Come see the tasty human goat,

31:08.325 --> 31:11.567
staked out like an idiot.

31:11.579 --> 31:13.786
( distant growl )
( baaing )

31:13.789 --> 31:16.952
Rygel:
Whoa! You wanted him,
you got him!

31:18.502 --> 31:19.787
(growling)

31:19.795 --> 31:21.535
( baaing )

31:22.965 --> 31:25.377
What's the matter?
You not hungry?

31:25.384 --> 31:28.342
Red Rover, Red Rover,
send Cujo right over.

31:28.345 --> 31:29.471
(growling)

31:29.472 --> 31:31.133
Come on, little buddy!

31:37.396 --> 31:39.227
( baaing )

31:41.942 --> 31:43.603
Come on, doggie.

31:43.611 --> 31:45.351
(growling)

31:45.362 --> 31:47.398
( snarling )

31:48.574 --> 31:50.485
Damn you.

31:50.493 --> 31:52.529
Come on.

31:52.536 --> 31:54.822
Come on, come on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:54.830 --> 31:56.491
Want some of this? Yeah.

31:56.499 --> 31:58.239
Grade A prime American beef.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.161
Come on! Come on, damn you!

32:00.169 --> 32:01.284
( barking )

32:04.048 --> 32:06.004
What the hell is your problem?

32:06.008 --> 32:08.044
Can't even hit a door.

32:08.052 --> 32:09.588
Come on!

32:09.595 --> 32:11.460
Come on, baby, bring it on!

32:11.472 --> 32:13.713
Yeah, you know you want
some of this.

32:13.724 --> 32:16.306
Come on! Whoo!

32:16.310 --> 32:18.221
Right here, right here,
right now.

32:18.229 --> 32:19.514
Oh! Oh!

32:19.522 --> 32:20.762
Damn!

32:22.149 --> 32:23.685
Oh, man!

32:30.741 --> 32:32.857
(growling)

32:33.911 --> 32:36.402
( screaming )

32:49.718 --> 32:51.925
Door, door, door, door, door!

32:54.181 --> 32:56.593
(electronic squeaks)

32:56.600 --> 32:58.010
Thanks.

32:58.018 --> 32:59.804
Now that was a plan.

33:01.105 --> 33:05.064
(yelling in distance)

33:10.322 --> 33:12.438
(yelling grows louder)

33:12.449 --> 33:16.533
Enterprising, you are.

33:16.537 --> 33:20.826
Expecting you I have been.

33:22.376 --> 33:24.708
What to do now?

33:28.299 --> 33:32.292
You know, Sikozu...

33:32.303 --> 33:36.717
a chance you took to come here.

33:36.724 --> 33:44.312
Understand. By contracting for
my service, I am forbidden
to reveal anything.

33:44.315 --> 33:51.938
The pathetic bearded one must
offer little hope for you
to risk my mercy.

33:51.947 --> 33:53.653
Highly ineffective,

33:53.657 --> 33:55.363
but he will fight.

33:58.537 --> 34:02.200
We will be gone before
they can reach us.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.323
My worries now are few.

34:05.502 --> 34:08.869
I hope lam not one of them.

34:10.925 --> 34:12.711
Go back.

34:13.594 --> 34:18.179
Divert them astray.

34:18.182 --> 34:26.647
When we withdraw, I shall honor
your contribution and take
you with us.

34:26.649 --> 34:28.605
Thank you, Warlord.

34:28.609 --> 34:29.394
My blessings.

34:42.373 --> 34:44.534
You're not exactly a
team player, are you?

34:44.541 --> 34:46.452
Don't worry, I'm not going
to hurt you.

34:46.460 --> 34:47.870
Told Chiana she could do that.

34:47.878 --> 34:49.414
(grunts)

34:49.421 --> 34:51.503
All right, here's the deal.

34:51.507 --> 34:53.623
We're going to be really,
really quiet

34:53.634 --> 34:56.421
so the Pirates of the Caribbean
don't hear us, okay?

34:59.974 --> 35:04.263
Pilot, tell Miss Booksmart here
how many kids you got.

35:04.270 --> 35:08.604
Six before I was joined
with Elack.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.472
You're a mommy-killer.

35:10.484 --> 35:12.020
How does that make you feel?

35:12.027 --> 35:14.109
I do not choose my assignments.

35:14.113 --> 35:15.649
I simply follow orders.

35:15.656 --> 35:18.739
Follow orders?
I thought you were smart.

35:18.742 --> 35:20.573
You can't come up with
something better than that?

35:20.577 --> 35:23.193
I studied harder than you
could imagine.

35:23.205 --> 35:25.867
l sacrificed more than
you will ever attain.

35:25.874 --> 35:29.787
Do not presume to moralize with
your narrow perspective.

35:29.795 --> 35:31.080
Hey.

35:31.088 --> 35:33.704
Listen to what Pilot
intercepted.

35:33.716 --> 35:36.048
Returning to retrieve
you now, Warlord.

35:36.051 --> 35:38.463
No other suitable
Leviathans found.

35:38.470 --> 35:41.928
llkog:
Grudeks, was the message sent?

35:41.932 --> 35:46.972
Her employers are aware
Sikozu's own errors in judgment
cost her her life.

35:47.730 --> 35:49.470
Welcome to the universe.

35:51.317 --> 35:53.808
No. No, that's...
that's not fair.

35:53.819 --> 35:55.480
That's not right.

35:55.487 --> 35:58.820
I will not have my reputation
tainted by a negative report.

35:58.824 --> 36:02.487
Allow me to give you another
narrow perspective.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.492
Your options are limited.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.911
So you can either help or
we're gonna truss you up

36:09.918 --> 36:12.751
like a Christmas turkey and
dump you in the bilge.

36:15.132 --> 36:16.463
Do I have another option?

36:18.886 --> 36:20.467
No.

36:20.471 --> 36:23.634
You have to resist
shooting at them.
-Yes, I got it.

36:23.640 --> 36:26.347
If the hoses are ruptured in
the wrong order you'll
create an...

36:26.352 --> 36:29.515
Both:
air fuel bomb that will destroy
the whole ship.

36:29.521 --> 36:32.479
Yes. Chiana, you don't have to
do this if you don't want to.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.265
I said I would, Crichton.

36:35.277 --> 36:36.562
Just go.

36:36.570 --> 36:37.980
Yeah, but if you don't wanna...

36:37.988 --> 36:42.152
Oh, for yotz sake! She gets more
blind from drinking raslik.

36:44.995 --> 36:47.202
All right, by popular demand.

37:06.308 --> 37:10.517
All right, when Chiana gets up
here, she comes off, bucket
of bolts goes on.

37:10.521 --> 37:11.510
It's a zip.

37:15.859 --> 37:18.066
All right, Pip.

37:19.363 --> 37:20.728
Your call.

37:22.699 --> 37:24.200
Let's fly.

37:42.469 --> 37:43.675
-Warlord llkog!
-What?

37:43.679 --> 37:45.044
-He was falling.
-Where?

37:45.055 --> 37:46.511
There, I swear an oath.

37:49.560 --> 37:52.142
What is that?

38:32.352 --> 38:33.762
I'm blind.

38:33.770 --> 38:35.726
Just... just lights and shapes.

38:35.731 --> 38:36.686
Get her down.

38:36.690 --> 38:38.191
Tell me about the hoses.

38:38.192 --> 38:41.184
White. Far right. White hose.

38:41.195 --> 38:42.480
Some kind of mist.

38:42.488 --> 38:44.069
Frozen hydrogen drixoride.

38:44.072 --> 38:46.688
In the center, orange
welding pipe.

38:46.700 --> 38:49.032
Black jackhammer on the left.

38:49.036 --> 38:50.742
Where's your frelling arm?!

38:50.746 --> 38:52.782
Stop spinning and reach for it.

38:52.789 --> 38:53.995
What's the order?

38:53.999 --> 38:58.083
Right, left, center.
No deviation.

38:58.086 --> 38:59.792
Hydrogen first, right?

38:59.796 --> 39:01.957
Sikozu:
Then adding the jackhammer's
pressurized brontium

39:01.965 --> 39:04.251
should prevent the explosion
from being catastrophic.

39:04.259 --> 39:05.715
Light it up with the welder.

39:05.719 --> 39:07.835
No, not my hand!

39:07.846 --> 39:10.804
Oh! You rajnot!

39:13.477 --> 39:15.308
No. No, no!

39:15.312 --> 39:16.017
( screaming )

39:16.021 --> 39:17.101
(yells)

39:17.105 --> 39:19.482
(screaming):
No! No!

39:20.275 --> 39:22.732
(girls screaming)

39:24.696 --> 39:26.652
( gunshots )

39:26.657 --> 39:29.364
1812! Covering fire!

39:29.368 --> 39:30.858
( "The 1812 Overture" plays )

39:30.869 --> 39:32.700
Damn it, covering fire!

39:32.704 --> 39:35.491
("The 1812 Overture" playing )

39:35.499 --> 39:38.366
Fire, you frelnik! Fire!

39:38.377 --> 39:40.618
Left, right, center...

39:40.629 --> 39:42.244
No, right, left, center.

39:42.256 --> 39:43.712
Oh, trat, trat, trat!

39:47.678 --> 39:48.667
Right.

39:49.471 --> 39:49.709
Left.

39:52.099 --> 39:53.680
Center.

39:53.684 --> 39:54.719
Whoo!

39:58.814 --> 40:01.806
Yeah!

40:01.817 --> 40:03.682
Yeah, come on, baby, yeah.

40:03.694 --> 40:05.685
Please, baby, please, baby,
please, baby please,
baby, please.

40:06.863 --> 40:08.114
(yells)

40:08.115 --> 40:09.901
( screaming )

40:09.908 --> 40:13.116
Rygel!

40:13.120 --> 40:15.827
Do not drop my hand.

40:15.831 --> 40:18.698
Oh, why am I bothering?

40:18.709 --> 40:20.700
I got ya. I got ya.

40:22.170 --> 40:24.661
Oh. I tried.

40:24.673 --> 40:28.006
Rygel, you bastard!

40:28.010 --> 40:29.170
I tried.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.723
Oh, dren.

41:12.846 --> 41:15.087
No Pilot muerta.

41:17.726 --> 41:19.933
No Crichton muerta.

41:38.997 --> 41:42.956
All right, here's the thing.

41:42.959 --> 41:44.290
You might not want to
come with us.

41:44.294 --> 41:48.503
We are not the best traveling
companions.

41:49.257 --> 41:52.670
I am going to get my life back.

41:53.679 --> 41:57.171
I will not end up like you.

42:02.187 --> 42:04.223
Okay.

42:08.235 --> 42:10.977
I hate that you're doing this.

42:10.987 --> 42:17.825
The returning Grudek ship
would've destroyed us if we
hadn't left the Sacred Space.

42:17.828 --> 42:23.619
And we would like to repay
our debt before we pass.

42:25.627 --> 42:28.960
You don't owe us anything.

42:28.964 --> 42:31.000
Nevertheless.

42:31.007 --> 42:37.799
If we are able, you shall
arrive at the planet where you
think your friends may be.

42:37.806 --> 42:42.675
It was your dream, yours and
Elack's to die there.

42:44.020 --> 42:47.854
No dream is guaranteed,
Commander.

42:47.858 --> 42:52.852
The grace of age is we,
we learn to accept.

43:11.965 --> 43:14.331
I'm not coming here anymore.

43:16.928 --> 43:18.634
Why not?

43:18.638 --> 43:22.096
Doesn't change anything.
And it makes me sad.

43:22.100 --> 43:23.135
Hmm.

43:23.143 --> 43:25.259
So what's next?

43:25.270 --> 43:27.352
What's left?

43:28.106 --> 43:29.687
Wormholes.

43:31.109 --> 43:35.978
I gotta recreate a ton
of equations. The new girl
smashed 'em up.

43:35.989 --> 43:38.105
Oh, new.

43:38.116 --> 43:40.323
New is good.

43:40.327 --> 43:42.113
Not always.

43:42.120 --> 43:44.156
Hey,babe.
-Thanks.

43:45.123 --> 43:46.158
Who's this?

43:46.166 --> 43:46.951
Um...

43:49.085 --> 43:49.949
No one.

44:29.876 --> 44:33.994
(whistles "1812 Overture" )

44:34.005 --> 44:38.419
( repeats same tune)

44:38.426 --> 44:41.884
(whistling)

44:41.888 --> 44:45.472
( plays "1812 Overture")

44:45.475 --> 44:48.933
(whistling and playing tune)
