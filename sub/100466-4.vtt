00:06.281 --> 00:07.740
Hands!
Don't even think about it.

00:08.824 --> 00:09.573
Hello.

00:10.031 --> 00:12.115
Device codename, Emperia.
They stole it from Russia.

00:12.198 --> 00:15.198
Emperia is the cyber-warfare
equivalent of an atomic bomb.

00:15.281 --> 00:16.239
You mentioned jihadists?

00:16.740 --> 00:18.031
They have
secured a deal for this device.

00:18.115 --> 00:19.156
If we do this together,

00:19.240 --> 00:20.740
Emperia's mine to take home
to Russia.

00:20.824 --> 00:22.156
We just want the people
he's meeting.

00:22.240 --> 00:24.240
Just discovered
a backdoor into our systems.

00:24.323 --> 00:26.115
He's accessed
every bit of intel we've had.

00:26.198 --> 00:27.824
If there is anything
I can ever do to help...

00:27.907 --> 00:29.365
Yeah, there's a couple
of fellas coming into town.

00:29.448 --> 00:30.949
I wouldn't mind you putting them
in the system.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.031
I will.
Just got a lead on Zayef
from Mahir.

00:33.323 --> 00:34.407
We have eyes on hostiles.

00:34.490 --> 00:35.949
We got some unexpected company.

00:37.365 --> 00:39.407
Now we grab Emperia,
that's the mission.

00:39.490 --> 00:41.240
Package secure,
moving for exfil.

00:42.573 --> 00:44.281
Anyone else want to be
a fucking hero?

01:07.782 --> 01:10.031
What's the plan, boss?

01:10.115 --> 01:11.490
Not our fight.

01:12.949 --> 01:14.907
What if they start
popping civvies?

01:43.824 --> 01:44.699
Wyatt, moving!

01:57.490 --> 01:58.740
Grenade!

01:58.824 --> 01:59.907

I'll need my package back
and the name of the buyer.

03:28.365 --> 03:30.532
You think you're the first
person to try and rob from me?

03:30.615 --> 03:33.657
I came here to make a deal.
You are the thief.

03:33.740 --> 03:35.740
You put that gun down.

03:35.824 --> 03:36.740
Now!
Danny.

03:36.824 --> 03:38.699
I'm sick of your
fucking bullshit, Topal.

03:38.782 --> 03:40.657
Just give them
what they want.

03:40.740 --> 03:41.865
We have enough.

03:41.949 --> 03:43.156
It's not a question
of enough.

03:54.448 --> 03:56.365
In the basement.

03:56.448 --> 03:57.407
Safe.

03:59.448 --> 04:00.365
We go.

04:00.448 --> 04:02.573
So, ladies and gentlemen,

04:02.657 --> 04:05.532
welcome so much
to our little fundraiser.

04:05.615 --> 04:07.782
I want you all to look
deep inside your hearts

04:07.865 --> 04:09.907
and give...generously.

04:09.990 --> 04:11.073
This is gonna be a problem.

04:11.156 --> 04:12.365
Put everything in the bag.
Everything!

04:12.448 --> 04:13.573
Jewelry, take it all.

04:13.657 --> 04:16.156
Have you removed the device
from the lockbox?

04:16.240 --> 04:18.740
No, it's still calibrating.

04:22.365 --> 04:24.281
You never said
they were people like this.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.532
Because I didn't think
you'd be stupid enough

04:25.615 --> 04:26.907
to turn up, sirens blaring!

04:26.990 --> 04:27.907
I'm a policeman.

04:27.990 --> 04:29.073
Hey, hey, we can still
track these--

04:29.156 --> 04:31.156
No, no, enough.

04:31.240 --> 04:33.198
You used me.
People have died.

04:33.281 --> 04:34.198
This is not your town.

04:34.281 --> 04:36.073
Yoni, listen to me.
No, no, I mean it.

04:36.156 --> 04:38.907
Leave before I arrest you.

05:02.532 --> 05:03.949
It's gone.
What?

05:04.031 --> 05:04.990
The fucking safe
is burnt through

05:05.073 --> 05:05.990
and my package is gone.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.031
That's impossible.
Where is it?

05:07.115 --> 05:08.448
Topal, just stop.

05:08.532 --> 05:10.573
You know this piece of shit?

05:10.657 --> 05:11.782
A long time ago.

05:11.865 --> 05:13.615
Is that what this
is all about?

05:13.699 --> 05:15.281
Some girl
from the old neighborhood?

05:15.365 --> 05:17.240
And what now, you--you think
if you get the money,

05:17.323 --> 05:18.615
she come
running back to you?

05:18.699 --> 05:21.073
Is that it,
you little piece of shit, huh?

05:23.365 --> 05:25.782
No.
No more.

05:30.573 --> 05:32.657
Take the package away!

05:34.490 --> 05:36.782
Move to RV3, move!

05:47.031 --> 05:48.323
Move!
Moving.

05:49.949 --> 05:51.115
Move!

05:54.532 --> 05:55.865
Move, move!

06:08.949 --> 06:10.699
Is that your best shot,
taxi boy?

06:11.949 --> 06:13.073
You got nothing.

06:14.407 --> 06:15.323
Nothing.

06:21.448 --> 06:22.365
Yada!

06:22.448 --> 06:24.073
Just let him go.
He's nothing.

06:31.448 --> 06:32.573
It was an accident.

06:35.782 --> 06:36.740
Rivkah.

06:36.824 --> 06:38.699
Don't you dare touch me.

06:44.240 --> 06:46.865
Bravo Three, sitrep.
Zero, I'm heading west.

06:46.949 --> 06:48.448
Bump key reset complete.

06:50.031 --> 06:52.031
Almost there.
Closing in on RV3.

06:52.115 --> 06:53.448
Copy. I'm two clicks south.

07:00.865 --> 07:02.073
Fuck.

07:51.573 --> 07:54.782
You.
You changed the combination.

07:54.865 --> 07:56.615
Mate, I can't help you.

07:56.699 --> 07:58.407
Have you tried tech support?

07:58.490 --> 08:00.740
No, no, no, no.
It was you.

08:00.824 --> 08:03.824
Haim still needed
to know the numbers.

08:03.907 --> 08:07.073
All right, you got me.

08:07.156 --> 08:11.490
Four, five, eight, nine.

08:11.573 --> 08:13.699
You're just going
to tell me?

08:13.782 --> 08:15.699
I didn't realize
I had options.

08:30.573 --> 08:31.657
You should think
very carefully

08:31.740 --> 08:33.115
about your next move, huh?

08:33.198 --> 08:36.532
Yeah.

08:36.615 --> 08:38.532
I don't think.

08:38.615 --> 08:40.865
It's my secret power.

08:40.948 --> 08:43.323
You would die to protect it?

08:46.198 --> 08:48.532
Do you even know
what it does?

08:48.615 --> 08:51.115
It's just an object to you.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.824
Worth something
but worth killing for?

08:53.907 --> 08:55.156
I don't think so.

08:55.240 --> 08:58.990
He already did.
Yada Haim, all the way down.

09:00.949 --> 09:03.573
How's that working out
for you, mate?

09:03.657 --> 09:06.865
I feel fine, thank you.

09:06.949 --> 09:10.198
I remember
what it's like.

09:10.281 --> 09:14.865
I went from fixing old jeeps
in the desert

09:14.949 --> 09:17.907
to a covert op
in a Libyan nightclub.

09:17.990 --> 09:20.323
Shit hits the fan.

09:20.407 --> 09:23.115
I never told anyone
it was my first kill.

09:24.615 --> 09:26.990
I didn't want to look weak,
you know?

09:27.073 --> 09:28.532
You think that's
what this is about?

09:28.615 --> 09:32.031
Yeah, don't you?

09:32.115 --> 09:33.824
I just need the combination.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.740
I never stopped to ask myself

09:35.824 --> 09:37.907
if this
is what I really wanted.

09:37.990 --> 09:40.365
You've still got that choice.

09:40.448 --> 09:42.031
Danny!

09:42.115 --> 09:43.448
She talks too fucking much.

09:46.615 --> 09:47.949
No, Danny.

09:48.031 --> 09:49.782
Danny, Danny.

09:51.490 --> 09:53.448
No, no!

10:03.615 --> 10:04.782
Danny.

10:06.115 --> 10:07.740
How the fuck
can't you find her?

10:07.824 --> 10:10.156
Sergeant,
we are all concerned here.

10:10.240 --> 10:12.073
We need to keep our emotions
in check.

10:12.156 --> 10:13.448
No, we should be out there
kicking in doors.

10:13.532 --> 10:15.865
And which doors
do you suggest?

10:15.990 --> 10:17.281
Danny's door.

10:17.365 --> 10:19.657
That's what Topal called
the guy on his crew, Danny.

10:19.740 --> 10:21.115
I've been running checks
on our records,

10:21.198 --> 10:22.573
but I'm drawing blanks.

10:22.657 --> 10:23.949
What about your police friend?

10:24.031 --> 10:26.782
He's not picking up.
I'll keep trying him.

10:26.865 --> 10:30.240
What about Russian SVR files,
foreign intelligence?

10:30.323 --> 10:31.448
Surely they would have a list

10:31.532 --> 10:32.824
of any known players
in the region.

10:32.907 --> 10:34.949
And if I access the system
from your computers,

10:35.031 --> 10:37.323
it's going to raise a lot more
difficult questions for me

10:37.407 --> 10:38.824
when I get home.

10:38.907 --> 10:39.907
Maybe you could just
tell them

10:39.990 --> 10:41.448
you're fucking us over again,
how about that?

10:42.699 --> 10:45.115
This is Novin
we're talking about.

10:51.156 --> 10:52.490
Israeli male, late 20s...

10:52.573 --> 10:53.782
James?

10:53.865 --> 10:55.824
Nine letters.

10:55.907 --> 10:59.657
A pungent tempest.

10:59.740 --> 11:02.156
Oh, come on.
You do the Sunday crossword.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.281
Nine letters.
Pungent tempest.

11:04.365 --> 11:06.156
Shitstorm.

11:06.240 --> 11:07.865
That's the word
I'm looking for.

11:07.949 --> 11:10.824
Listen, James,
we were forced to engage.

11:10.907 --> 11:12.490
If we had any other choice,
I assure you--

11:12.573 --> 11:15.699
Shots fired there
echo over here, Alexander.

11:15.782 --> 11:17.699
It's not worth it.
Withdraw your people.

11:17.782 --> 11:19.657
There's another thing.

11:19.740 --> 11:22.031
The people that have
the stolen Russian tech,

11:22.115 --> 11:23.824
they also grabbed
one of our own,

11:23.907 --> 11:25.949
Lance Corporal Novin.

11:26.031 --> 11:26.990
Mm.

11:27.073 --> 11:30.323
And you want me
to sanction a rescue.

11:30.407 --> 11:33.990
This level of noise
needs a worthy payoff,

11:34.073 --> 11:37.156
something to justify
the mess we're making.

11:37.240 --> 11:41.448
So...if you want
your soldier back,

11:41.532 --> 11:42.740
secure the package,

11:42.824 --> 11:44.699
eliminate
the Russian operative,

11:44.782 --> 11:47.532
and clean up our trail.

11:47.615 --> 11:49.407
Are we clear?

11:53.115 --> 11:55.323
Yes, sir.

11:58.949 --> 12:00.782
We think we know
where Novin is.

12:01.907 --> 12:03.365
A place called the towers

12:03.448 --> 12:06.615
in the notorious
Neve Sha'anan district.

12:06.699 --> 12:08.657
What's the link
with this Danny guy?

12:08.740 --> 12:11.532
SVR files mention a number
of persons of interest,

12:11.615 --> 12:14.073
including a dealer
by the name of Danny Dahan

12:14.156 --> 12:16.031
who runs his business
from the towers.

12:16.115 --> 12:17.907
So if they're gonna take her
anywhere...

12:17.990 --> 12:19.699
We go in covert.

12:19.782 --> 12:22.573
Zero and I will provide
external support.

12:22.657 --> 12:26.281
Grab our soldier back and
secure the stolen Russian tech.

12:26.365 --> 12:28.115
Secure it for Russia.

12:32.031 --> 12:33.448
Here.

12:35.532 --> 12:37.240
You're part of the team.

12:41.990 --> 12:44.949
Four numbers, that's it.

12:45.031 --> 12:46.615
Then this is all over, huh?

12:46.699 --> 12:50.031
I know mate, but I'm not
gonna make it easy for you.

12:50.115 --> 12:51.949
I just can't do that.

13:01.365 --> 13:04.657
Mr. Haim, are you ready
to make a deal?

13:04.740 --> 13:06.073
Just a moment.

13:13.198 --> 13:15.323
So where is Haim now?

13:15.407 --> 13:18.281
Haim's dead, but...

13:18.365 --> 13:20.281
I have what you want.

13:20.365 --> 13:22.156
Why should I believe you?

13:22.240 --> 13:24.615
I don't care whether
you believe me or not.

13:24.699 --> 13:25.949
There are other buyers.

13:26.031 --> 13:28.740
I doubt that very much.

14:14.573 --> 14:15.490
Talk to me.

14:15.573 --> 14:17.699
Let's make a deal.

14:34.949 --> 14:36.615
Throwing out some intel
to the cop about Topal,

14:36.699 --> 14:38.865
in case we're wrong about this.

14:38.949 --> 14:41.115
We'd better not be.

14:41.198 --> 14:42.240
Comms check.

14:42.323 --> 14:44.240
Yep, good check.

14:49.115 --> 14:51.323
How long have you two
been buddies?

14:51.407 --> 14:53.448
Since we were little kids.

14:55.949 --> 14:59.740
Kind of cute how you still
take orders from him.

14:59.824 --> 15:01.865
This isn't gonna work,
you know?

15:01.949 --> 15:04.365
His parents,
they fed and clothed me

15:04.448 --> 15:07.073
after mine kicked me out.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.824
Topal is my boy.

15:10.031 --> 15:12.240
He also asked you to wait.

15:12.323 --> 15:13.740
I'm impatient.

15:13.824 --> 15:15.949
It's my flaw.

15:18.490 --> 15:20.907
Arabs, Jews.

15:20.990 --> 15:22.949
It's just a different way
to divide us.

15:23.031 --> 15:25.907
But rich people don't care
about that.

15:25.990 --> 15:27.615
They care about money.

15:27.699 --> 15:29.907
So I'll keep doing this
as long as it takes,

15:29.990 --> 15:33.240
as hard as it gets,
until you talk.

15:33.323 --> 15:34.699
You get one breath.

15:57.031 --> 15:58.448
Ready to talk?

16:05.490 --> 16:07.281
Four zeroes.

16:10.699 --> 16:12.990
Four fucking zeroes?

16:13.865 --> 16:14.782
Four zeroes.

16:14.865 --> 16:16.365
Shit, you're actually
saying the truth.

16:17.573 --> 16:20.907
I fucking broke you, huh?

17:00.615 --> 17:03.490
Zero, we're heading
into the west-side stairwell.

17:08.949 --> 17:11.699
Start from the bottom
and work our way up, I guess.

17:17.323 --> 17:18.281
Danny.

17:22.448 --> 17:25.115
Where is she?
What happened?

17:25.198 --> 17:26.490
We have a runner.

17:26.573 --> 17:29.740
A woman moving from
the fifth floor, east block.

17:29.824 --> 17:33.073
I've put a bounty on her.
Capture or fucking kill her!

17:38.615 --> 17:40.699
Yeah,
that doesn't sound good.

17:40.782 --> 17:41.699
Let's move.

18:49.573 --> 18:51.198
Fucking bitch!

19:36.240 --> 19:38.156
It's okay. It's okay.

20:27.657 --> 20:29.281
What the hell is this?

20:30.281 --> 20:31.907
They're coming
from fucking everywhere.

20:31.990 --> 20:33.907
This isn't us.

20:37.115 --> 20:38.073
Clear.

20:39.865 --> 20:41.407
Sounds like
the action's upstairs.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.782
Yeah, no shit.

20:43.865 --> 20:45.240
We should be tooled up
for this.

20:45.323 --> 20:48.198
I agree, but you want
to talk tactics now?

20:48.281 --> 20:49.532
I'm just saying.

20:49.615 --> 20:51.573
Time and a place, mate.

20:51.657 --> 20:53.115
Zarkova?

20:56.490 --> 20:57.949
Tango down.

21:01.198 --> 21:03.240
Down.

21:03.323 --> 21:04.782
Let's get upstairs.

21:23.323 --> 21:26.115
Novin.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:26.198 --> 21:27.115
About time.

21:27.198 --> 21:29.198
Holy shit,
I thought we'd lost you.

21:30.532 --> 21:31.448
You good?

21:31.532 --> 21:33.281
Bloody awesome.

21:33.365 --> 21:35.573
Fucking hell.

21:35.657 --> 21:37.281
You're a weapon, kid.

21:37.365 --> 21:39.115
Package?

21:39.198 --> 21:42.156
Yeah, I'm fine, baby.
Thanks for asking.

21:42.240 --> 21:44.073
Well, we're not
out of it yet.

21:44.156 --> 21:45.740
Let's keep moving.

21:45.824 --> 21:47.949
You need a shoulder?
No.

21:48.031 --> 21:50.281
Oh, yeah, maybe.
Fuck.

21:50.365 --> 21:52.073
Let's go.
Yeah.

21:54.490 --> 21:56.573
Zero, package secured.

21:56.657 --> 21:58.156
We're moving out.

22:00.865 --> 22:02.115
Let's move.

22:10.281 --> 22:12.323
Stay with me, baby.
Stay with me.

22:18.073 --> 22:19.824
Oh, hello.

22:27.240 --> 22:29.782
Oh, you've gotta
be fucking kidding me.

22:31.407 --> 22:34.031
Bravos, sitrep.

22:36.073 --> 22:37.949
Keep moving.

22:43.240 --> 22:45.156
I was looking for that.

22:45.240 --> 22:46.699
Bravos.

22:54.782 --> 22:55.907
Bravos, sitrep.

22:55.990 --> 22:57.573
It's just wax.

23:00.949 --> 23:03.198
I'm Russian.
I don't get one.

23:03.281 --> 23:05.699
Bravos, please respond.

23:09.448 --> 23:10.573
What was that?

23:12.407 --> 23:14.407
So this is it, I guess.

23:14.490 --> 23:17.156
An execution
on the fifth floor, great.

23:17.240 --> 23:20.198
Speak again,
I'll fucking shoot you.

23:20.281 --> 23:21.865
Confirm floor number.

23:23.907 --> 23:24.865
Fifth floor.

23:29.824 --> 23:30.907
On your knees.

23:30.990 --> 23:33.281
Oh, it's gonna be
that kind of party.

23:36.073 --> 23:37.573
Ascending the block
opposite them.

23:37.657 --> 23:38.907
Yes, sir.

23:38.990 --> 23:40.615
What part of the building?

23:40.699 --> 23:43.198
North, one tap.
South, two.

23:43.281 --> 23:45.907
South, fifth floor.

23:45.990 --> 23:47.407
One tap to confirm.

23:49.281 --> 23:51.990
Bravo Four confirms
fifth floor, south apartment.

23:52.073 --> 23:54.865
I need to know what it does,

23:54.949 --> 23:56.740
how much it is worth,

23:56.824 --> 23:58.532
everything about it.

23:58.615 --> 23:59.949
Well, I think I speak

24:00.031 --> 24:01.448
on behalf of everybody here

24:01.532 --> 24:04.407
when I say go fuck yourself.

24:04.490 --> 24:05.865
Sure about that?

24:05.949 --> 24:07.907
Hey, do you pick on her
because she's a woman

24:07.990 --> 24:09.824
or because she's got
bigger balls than all of you?

24:09.907 --> 24:10.949
I broke her once.

24:11.031 --> 24:13.407
I'm fucking looking forward
to break her again.

24:13.490 --> 24:15.657
Well, you're not exactly
a genius, then, are you?

24:15.740 --> 24:16.782
She knows everything,

24:16.865 --> 24:18.073
so you put a bullet
in her head, and guess what.

24:18.156 --> 24:20.615
That conversation ends
pretty fucking--ahh.

24:20.699 --> 24:22.448
Yeah, that feels better.

24:27.532 --> 24:29.323
Don't fucking move.

24:32.198 --> 24:33.365
Right, which apartment is it?

24:33.448 --> 24:36.532
Open window, shuttered,
white curtain, green.

24:38.490 --> 24:39.448
Topal, man, come on.

24:41.699 --> 24:43.448
I'm giving you
to the count of three.

24:43.532 --> 24:45.115
Wyatt!

24:45.198 --> 24:46.615
We're not giving
these guys shit.

24:46.699 --> 24:47.782
You didn't go through all that
for nothing.

24:47.865 --> 24:49.156
Fuck you.
You know, my aunt

24:49.240 --> 24:50.949
used to have green blinds
like this in her house

24:51.031 --> 24:52.281
and I fucking--

24:53.573 --> 24:55.657
Green blinds.
Yeah, got it.

24:55.740 --> 24:58.156
All right,
listen to me closely.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.490
One.

24:59.573 --> 25:01.949
I'm directly opposite you,
elevation about 30 degrees.

25:02.031 --> 25:03.490
The window's divided
into six panes.

25:03.573 --> 25:04.949
Top left, one.
Top right, two.

25:05.031 --> 25:06.115
Middle left, right,
three, four.

25:06.198 --> 25:07.115
Bottom left, right,
five, six.

25:07.198 --> 25:08.156
Two.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.365
Two taps.
Top right pane.

25:10.448 --> 25:11.865
Standing ready for target.

25:14.407 --> 25:15.824
Two taps to fire.

25:15.907 --> 25:16.949
Three.

25:23.365 --> 25:25.156
Everybody down.
Fire at will.

25:32.907 --> 25:34.031
Sitrep.

25:34.115 --> 25:35.740
Sitrep?

25:37.740 --> 25:39.865
Yeah, I think we're good.

25:39.949 --> 25:43.073
Fuck me, Wyatt.
That was way too close.

25:43.156 --> 25:45.198
Ah, never in doubt.
Nice work, Zarkova.

25:45.281 --> 25:46.198
Mm.

25:46.281 --> 25:47.740
Bravos good.
Checking for package.

25:47.824 --> 25:49.699
I suggest
we make ourselves scarce.

25:53.407 --> 25:55.156
You have a lovely home.

25:57.615 --> 26:00.073
Where the fuck is Topal?

26:03.407 --> 26:05.865
Rivkah.

26:05.949 --> 26:07.532
What happened...

26:07.615 --> 26:10.365
it was an accident, huh?

26:10.448 --> 26:12.198
I'm not like the others.

26:12.281 --> 26:13.824
I'm not a bad person.

26:17.782 --> 26:21.073
See, huh?
Let's just talk.

26:23.365 --> 26:24.281
Okay.

26:24.365 --> 26:25.865
Okay.

26:25.949 --> 26:27.323
I'm sorry.

26:52.949 --> 26:56.281
Boss, I just got off
the phone with Spiegel.

26:56.365 --> 26:58.323
He got the Imperiya device.

26:58.407 --> 26:59.782
Sorry, who the fuck
is Spiegel?

26:59.865 --> 27:01.615
He's Mac's little cop buddy.

27:01.699 --> 27:03.407
Okay.
Dickhead.

27:03.490 --> 27:06.073
So I tipped him off
about Topal and Rivkah Haim.

27:06.156 --> 27:07.365
Suggested it might work out

27:07.448 --> 27:09.615
for him to keep watch on Haim's
place, and it's paid off.

27:09.699 --> 27:11.949
What, you shared confidential
information with a civilian?

27:12.031 --> 27:14.699
He's not a civilian.
He's technically a copper.

27:16.156 --> 27:17.323
Could we skip to the bit

27:17.407 --> 27:18.740
where everyone's delighted
at what I've just done?

27:18.824 --> 27:19.949
Imperiya?

27:20.031 --> 27:22.281
Well, is he gonna just
hand it over to us or what?

27:22.365 --> 27:23.448
Uh, probably not,

27:23.532 --> 27:24.990
but it's in the evidence lockup
at Triasa Station,

27:25.073 --> 27:27.281
which is basically the shithole
of Tel Aviv cop shops.

27:27.365 --> 27:28.907
We could just walk in
and take it.

27:28.990 --> 27:30.073
With a bit of ingenuity,
yeah.

27:30.156 --> 27:31.281
We retrieve that device,

27:31.365 --> 27:33.073
I'm still taking it back home
to Russia.

27:33.156 --> 27:35.281
Oh, my God.
Absolutely.

27:35.365 --> 27:38.031
I'm sorry, I wasn't asking
a fucking question, Alexander.

27:39.073 --> 27:40.740
Can we be honest
with each other?

27:43.740 --> 27:46.240
Look, I haven't kept
anything from you.

27:47.448 --> 27:49.365
Did you show up?

27:49.448 --> 27:51.323
Meaning?
You know exactly what I mean.

27:51.407 --> 27:53.490
You said we'd meet one time
in Istanbul,

27:53.573 --> 27:54.865
see if there was anything
outside all--

27:54.949 --> 27:56.699
No, I didn't show up.
Did you?

27:58.115 --> 28:00.198
Did you?

28:00.281 --> 28:01.657
Wouldn't be asking
the question if I had.

28:01.740 --> 28:03.073
You done?

28:03.573 --> 28:04.657
I'm not sure
this conversation

28:04.740 --> 28:06.031
is entirely appropriate.

28:06.115 --> 28:07.323
Huh?

28:07.407 --> 28:10.198
That's funny, because you used
to really love inappropriate.

28:10.281 --> 28:11.824
Okay.

28:11.907 --> 28:13.365
I can still do this
by myself, you know.

28:13.448 --> 28:14.657
This is fantastic.

28:14.740 --> 28:16.990
McAllister, Novin, would you
accompany Captain Zarkova

28:17.073 --> 28:19.115
to the police station, please?

28:19.198 --> 28:20.657
What about me sir, please?

28:20.740 --> 28:23.407
Um, I have something else
in mind for you.

28:23.490 --> 28:24.740
Copy.

28:25.407 --> 28:27.031
We'll need the route
to the evidence locker.

28:27.115 --> 28:28.990
Have you got
the station schematics?

28:32.615 --> 28:34.031
Good to go?

28:37.740 --> 28:39.281
I gave up the code.

28:40.490 --> 28:42.115
I fucking folded.

28:44.115 --> 28:46.156
You didn't fold.

28:46.240 --> 28:49.198
You bought yourself some time
and it paid off.

28:49.281 --> 28:51.949
I wasn't thinking
tactically, Wyatt.

28:53.782 --> 28:56.740
I just--I just
didn't want to die.

28:56.824 --> 28:59.407
Not wanting to die
is not a weakness.

29:01.615 --> 29:03.407
It is for a soldier.

29:11.490 --> 29:12.573
There he is.

29:12.657 --> 29:16.615
Ahh, I appreciate the tip.
It was very useful.

29:16.699 --> 29:19.740
Hey, it was a long shot.
You made it work.

29:19.824 --> 29:20.907
My boss was very pleased

29:20.990 --> 29:22.907
that I could apprehend
such a dangerous criminal.

29:22.990 --> 29:25.031
Of course he was.
How was it?

29:25.115 --> 29:27.532
Ah, it was tough.
It was tough.

29:27.615 --> 29:29.740
I gave the Tango the option
to surrender, but--

29:29.824 --> 29:31.031
Tango?

29:31.115 --> 29:33.198
Yeah, someone's picking up
on the lingo.

29:34.448 --> 29:37.073
Uh, Captain Zarkova.
Lance Corporal Gracie Novin.

29:37.156 --> 29:38.865
They just wanted to come in
and congratulate you.

29:38.949 --> 29:40.573
We heard you were very brave.

29:40.657 --> 29:44.323
Ah, no, I just--
I was doing my job.

29:45.532 --> 29:46.490
You filled out
all the paperwork

29:46.573 --> 29:48.031
for Topal's stuff yet?

29:48.115 --> 29:50.156
Ah, no.
I'm only halfway through it.

29:50.240 --> 29:52.490
Well, they shouldn't make
a hero fill out forms, anyway.

29:52.573 --> 29:54.240
I'm not a hero.

29:54.323 --> 29:56.782
They've got people from
the Israeli Security Agency

29:56.865 --> 29:58.323
coming in
to examine the evidence

29:58.407 --> 30:01.281
I recovered from Topal.

30:01.365 --> 30:03.990
They were just on the phone.
Those guys are rude.

30:04.073 --> 30:05.407
Mm.

30:07.031 --> 30:09.156
Hey, I need to be
a little bit rude, actually.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.949
Just want to take a last look
at some bits of intel

30:11.031 --> 30:11.949
on Danny Dahan's mob.

30:12.031 --> 30:13.657
You are killing me here,
McAllister.

30:13.740 --> 30:14.949
Speegs.

30:15.031 --> 30:17.407
We might just leave
you guys to it, then, yeah?

30:18.198 --> 30:20.949
It's lovely to meet you.
Yes, you are lovely too.

30:21.031 --> 30:24.448
Uh, to meet you.
Also it's lovely.

30:24.532 --> 30:25.907
Good-bye.

30:27.407 --> 30:28.865
Fuck.

30:30.240 --> 30:31.782
Right, we--

30:31.865 --> 30:35.198
we have an additional set
of orders.

30:35.281 --> 30:38.782
Whitehall wants us to hang on
to the Imperiya device...

30:38.865 --> 30:40.824
and then they want us
to clean house.

30:43.407 --> 30:44.532
I'm sorry, clean house?

30:47.615 --> 30:50.031
You mean put a bullet
in Zarkova, right?

30:50.115 --> 30:52.281
She's on a legitimate op.

30:52.365 --> 30:54.198
That device belongs to Russia.

30:54.281 --> 30:55.699
It's one thing to take it
from her, but a kill order--

30:55.782 --> 30:57.657
We have no choice.

31:00.448 --> 31:01.990
Yeah.

31:02.073 --> 31:04.448
Who's the one you want
to get their hands dirty?

31:04.532 --> 31:05.990
Well, McAllister and Novin
are fine soldiers, but--

31:06.073 --> 31:09.198
Yeah, but they might have
an issue with it, right?

31:09.281 --> 31:11.740
But I trust you for this one.

31:12.657 --> 31:15.031
I'm not sure if I should take
that as a compliment or not.

31:15.115 --> 31:16.907
It's neither.
It's an order.

31:20.990 --> 31:23.156
All right, Alexander.

31:27.115 --> 31:28.573
Well, that was easy.

31:36.740 --> 31:39.407
So are you here to help
or just to keep an eye on me?

31:39.490 --> 31:41.532
You're the one
with the medal, baby.

31:41.615 --> 31:42.782
I'm just trying to keep up.

31:42.865 --> 31:43.865
It's good, you know,

31:43.949 --> 31:47.031
after all this time,
you still don't trust me.

31:47.115 --> 31:50.031
I trust you.
I actually missed you.

31:51.323 --> 31:54.198
Guess I don't really have any
friends outside of this, eh?

31:58.365 --> 32:00.365
There was no medal, Gracie.

32:00.448 --> 32:02.907
I did not return home a hero.

32:02.990 --> 32:04.740
Few months in military prison,
which was fine,

32:04.824 --> 32:06.448
but then I got a job
at a supply depot

32:06.532 --> 32:09.281
counting fucking blankets.

32:09.365 --> 32:12.156
Command said I'd betrayed
my country by helping Twenty.

32:12.240 --> 32:13.573
What the fuck?

32:13.657 --> 32:15.365
You pulled their nuts
out of the fire.

32:15.448 --> 32:17.240
And to admit that
would be to admit

32:17.323 --> 32:18.740
that they were in trouble
in the first place,

32:18.824 --> 32:21.365
so this device, Imperiya,

32:21.448 --> 32:23.156
it really is
my last chance to--

32:23.240 --> 32:24.448
Get your life back
to where it was

32:24.532 --> 32:25.782
before you met us dickheads.

32:25.865 --> 32:28.490
Well, I wasn't going
to say dickheads, but...

32:29.490 --> 32:32.240
25/1A.

32:32.323 --> 32:33.782
Yes.

32:33.865 --> 32:34.990
Sweet as.

32:37.365 --> 32:38.615
You're taking it?

32:38.699 --> 32:40.115
Somebody's got to take it
out of here.

32:40.198 --> 32:41.115
Yeah, I know.

32:41.198 --> 32:42.281
It's just that--

32:42.365 --> 32:44.115
Gonna take it from me?

32:57.532 --> 32:58.824
Get down!

33:03.907 --> 33:05.323
Bravo Three, contact.

33:05.407 --> 33:06.824
Copy that.
Package secure.

33:06.907 --> 33:08.281
We're in trouble.

33:08.365 --> 33:10.740
And we don't have weapons.
Shit.

33:10.824 --> 33:12.448
There must be something.

33:15.657 --> 33:17.824
Alpha Zero,
how long to backup?

33:17.907 --> 33:19.615
On our way.
Two minutes.

33:20.699 --> 33:22.532
Get outside for evac.

33:26.073 --> 33:28.365
Chetri!

33:31.031 --> 33:32.615
Swap ya?

33:32.699 --> 33:33.657
Good luck.

34:00.782 --> 34:02.115
Yeah.

34:03.532 --> 34:04.657
Let's go.

34:11.281 --> 34:12.364
Shit.

34:12.447 --> 34:13.907
The guys on the phone--

34:13.989 --> 34:16.364
I thought they were
Israeli Security, but--

34:16.447 --> 34:17.989
I'm so fucking stupid!

34:19.447 --> 34:21.699
All that shit
about me being super-cop,

34:21.782 --> 34:23.489
you were just using me.

34:29.281 --> 34:30.657
Spiegel, no!

34:30.739 --> 34:32.907
Spiegel, stop!

34:40.197 --> 34:42.239
Spiegel?

34:42.322 --> 34:44.614
Yoni?

34:44.699 --> 34:46.614
Yoni, come on.

34:46.699 --> 34:48.072
Yoni!

34:52.699 --> 34:54.281
I tried to stop him.

34:56.489 --> 34:58.156
Mac, we're clear, mate.

34:58.240 --> 35:01.115
Let's get a move on.

35:04.281 --> 35:06.198
Oh, shit, mate.
I'm sorry.

35:07.657 --> 35:10.615
I told him to stay down.
Didn't listen.

35:11.657 --> 35:13.949
Come on, mate.
We gotta go.

35:16.657 --> 35:17.532
Mac.

35:17.615 --> 35:19.615
Package?

35:19.699 --> 35:21.490
Secure.

35:26.782 --> 35:28.323
Back on.
Zarkova.

35:36.532 --> 35:37.532
Let's go.

35:38.865 --> 35:41.824
Zero, package secured.
Heading for exfil.

35:45.240 --> 35:47.323
Zero, contact!
Requesting backup!

36:03.115 --> 36:04.115
Zarkova!

36:05.198 --> 36:06.824
Zarkova!

36:10.907 --> 36:11.990
Where the fuck is she going?

36:12.073 --> 36:14.365
Fucking can't believe it!

36:14.448 --> 36:16.699
Zero,
Bravo Four has the package.

36:16.782 --> 36:19.031
She's in a police vehicle
headed south!

36:19.115 --> 36:20.740
Copy.

36:20.824 --> 36:22.323
With you for evac
in one minute.

36:28.782 --> 36:30.490
She played us.

36:30.573 --> 36:31.990
I knew it.
I fucking knew it!

36:32.073 --> 36:35.657
We did have orders to do
the same to her and worse.

36:35.740 --> 36:37.365
She should never have had
the device.

36:37.448 --> 36:38.865
Someone else should've
secured it first.

36:38.949 --> 36:41.740
That's enough with the chat.
Let's get ready to come in hot.

37:33.824 --> 37:35.490
Thank you.

37:56.198 --> 37:57.115
Moving!

37:59.657 --> 38:00.782
Changing!

38:07.907 --> 38:11.907
Boss, I have the kill shot.
Do I take it?

38:13.407 --> 38:14.323
No.

38:14.407 --> 38:17.073
No, focus on the targets!

38:27.198 --> 38:29.615
Contact rear, contact rear!

38:34.699 --> 38:37.323
Ah, shit!

38:37.407 --> 38:38.824
Take those fucking Tangos!

38:53.782 --> 38:55.990
More Tangos inbound!

38:57.240 --> 38:58.365
Fuck!

39:01.907 --> 39:03.490
She is coming.

39:03.573 --> 39:05.156
You should
sacrifice yourself.

39:05.240 --> 39:07.782
What?
So I can get free.

39:19.615 --> 39:21.198
Gun jam!
Gun down!

39:22.073 --> 39:24.532
Boss,
we're getting bumjacked!

39:28.281 --> 39:31.407
Zayef,
we have transport coming.

39:34.407 --> 39:37.281
There's no need for sacrifice.

39:37.365 --> 39:38.865
Brother,

39:38.949 --> 39:40.073
I'm joking.

39:40.156 --> 39:42.281
I will cover you.

39:42.365 --> 39:43.740
Now. Go, go!

39:46.240 --> 39:48.031
Boss, we gotta move!

39:50.949 --> 39:52.240
Yeah, this isn't good!

39:57.615 --> 39:59.031
Bravo Four,
this is Zero Alpha.

39:59.115 --> 40:01.240
We are pinned.

40:01.323 --> 40:03.198
Multiple rear Tangos.

40:03.281 --> 40:05.824
Request covering fire.

40:08.115 --> 40:10.949
I repeat,
Tangos front and rear.

40:11.031 --> 40:12.949
Katrina, we need backup.

40:30.115 --> 40:32.115
Incoming rear support!

40:40.949 --> 40:43.615
Bravo Four, get clear.
You're in the open.

41:04.532 --> 41:06.448
Moving out!

41:06.532 --> 41:08.365
Wyatt, on me!
Moving up!

41:15.824 --> 41:17.782
Clear.
Clear.

41:17.865 --> 41:20.365
Rear all clear.
Katrina, copy?

41:22.824 --> 41:25.281
Bravo Four, copy?

41:25.365 --> 41:26.824
Katrina!

41:41.740 --> 41:44.281
I know I'm not easy
sometimes.

41:50.573 --> 41:53.657
I had this made for you.

41:53.740 --> 41:55.990
Just like Mother
used to have.

42:02.073 --> 42:04.699
Thank you.

42:10.407 --> 42:13.031
Covert anti-terror unit.

42:13.115 --> 42:14.365
Say it.

42:15.573 --> 42:17.740
Covert anti-terror unit.

42:17.824 --> 42:19.657
And yet we have
public shoot-outs.

42:19.740 --> 42:22.323
A police station has turned
into the fucking "Wild Bunch."

42:22.407 --> 42:23.865
Two terror suspects
who have escaped

42:23.949 --> 42:26.365
with the very device that we
were trying to keep from them.

42:26.448 --> 42:30.699
Just remind me again
what Imperiya does.

42:30.782 --> 42:32.532
It has the ability
to shut down

42:32.615 --> 42:34.156
a city's infrastructure.

42:34.240 --> 42:35.699
And in the event
of a terror attack,

42:35.782 --> 42:38.073
that would be very fucking
bad news, wouldn't it?

42:38.156 --> 42:39.156
We've recovered phones

42:39.240 --> 42:41.073
from some
of the jihadi cell members.

42:41.156 --> 42:43.198
They may furnish us
with a number of leads.

42:43.281 --> 42:45.198
You failed, Alexander.

42:45.281 --> 42:47.031
On all counts.

42:47.115 --> 42:48.907
So don't give me maybes.

42:48.990 --> 42:50.615
Give me results.

42:50.699 --> 42:52.699
What about Captain Zarkova?

42:55.782 --> 42:57.407
Killed in action.

42:59.490 --> 43:01.198
Right.

43:01.281 --> 43:03.240
I supposed I should
get on the back channels,

43:03.323 --> 43:04.573
let the Russians know.

43:04.657 --> 43:07.281
Thank you.
Don't thank me.

43:07.365 --> 43:09.240
If Imperiya is used
in conjunction

43:09.323 --> 43:11.740
with a terrorist attack,

43:11.824 --> 43:13.657
that will be down to you.

43:14.490 --> 43:16.573
No protection,

43:16.657 --> 43:18.407
no way out.

43:18.490 --> 43:20.448
I understand.

43:31.907 --> 43:34.573
It's not enough
to serve alongside someone.

43:34.657 --> 43:38.073
You have to trust them too.

43:38.156 --> 43:42.657
Katrina Zarkova may have been
Russian special forces...

43:44.740 --> 43:46.323
But she was also one of us.

43:46.407 --> 43:48.615
She was
a dirty Russian bastard, sir.

43:48.699 --> 43:51.156
Ah, yes.

43:51.240 --> 43:53.115
Nevertheless.

43:53.198 --> 43:54.657
Seriously?

43:54.740 --> 43:57.115
He's right. You did piss off
with the device, didn't you?

43:57.198 --> 43:59.490
And you weren't going
to take it from me or worse?

43:59.573 --> 44:00.949
Oh, you know how it goes.

44:01.031 --> 44:02.990
You get orders.
You follow 'em.

44:03.073 --> 44:04.156
Most of the time.

44:04.240 --> 44:06.198
Are we gonna drink these
or not?

44:09.156 --> 44:10.782
To Zarkova.
Zarkova.

44:10.865 --> 44:12.240
Zarkova.
Zarkova.

44:12.323 --> 44:13.949
Is this really necessary?

44:14.031 --> 44:15.031
You're dead.
It's tradition.

44:15.115 --> 44:16.907
Okay.

44:16.990 --> 44:18.365
Dead don't get a drink.

44:23.073 --> 44:25.323
Apparently,
this time, they do.

44:25.407 --> 44:26.615
Oh, yes, they do.

44:26.699 --> 44:28.532
So I guess this is good-bye.

44:38.031 --> 44:39.573
Do svidanya.

44:39.657 --> 44:40.615
Adios.

44:41.865 --> 44:42.949
Ta-da.

44:44.115 --> 44:46.365
I'm glad you stayed alive,
Lance Corporal.

44:49.073 --> 44:50.365
Thank you, Captain.

44:51.782 --> 44:52.824
I'll show you out.

44:52.907 --> 44:54.156
You know,
I actually get the feeling

44:54.240 --> 44:57.865
that Zarkova hasn't been
a captain for a while, right?

44:57.949 --> 44:59.824
Yeah, what are you now?

44:59.907 --> 45:01.407
Second lieutenant, probably.

45:03.490 --> 45:06.490
Now I am...

45:06.573 --> 45:07.740
nothing.

45:10.615 --> 45:11.990
I'll send you a postcard,
short stuff.

45:12.073 --> 45:14.907
Don't forget the stamp,
you stingy bastard.

45:22.949 --> 45:26.073
I know he wasn't one of us,
but...

45:26.156 --> 45:28.532
he was a good kid.

45:28.615 --> 45:31.365
In the wrong job.

45:31.448 --> 45:33.198
Spiegel.

45:33.281 --> 45:34.990
Spiegel.

45:37.156 --> 45:39.490
This'll get you to Beirut.

45:39.573 --> 45:43.156
And something
to get you settled.

45:46.365 --> 45:49.448
Lisette Moravcikova.

45:49.532 --> 45:51.323
I don't really
look like a Lisette.

45:54.740 --> 45:56.156
What will you do?

45:57.198 --> 45:58.699
Uh...

46:01.323 --> 46:04.323
I mean, I can't ever go home,
as you know.

46:05.990 --> 46:07.573
My whole life
has been about the military,

46:07.657 --> 46:10.115
about the service, and...

46:10.198 --> 46:11.740
and now that's gone,
I, uh--

46:13.281 --> 46:14.824
Yeah.

46:16.532 --> 46:18.448
Maybe it's not
such a bad feeling.

46:22.615 --> 46:24.448
You should try it.

46:26.532 --> 46:28.240
I've got...

46:28.323 --> 46:31.156
Responsibilities?

46:31.240 --> 46:32.740
Yeah.

46:32.824 --> 46:34.949
Yeah.

46:35.031 --> 46:36.073
I don't know, maybe--

46:36.156 --> 46:38.073
maybe once this job's done.

46:39.990 --> 46:41.323
One last mission.

46:46.407 --> 46:48.490
There's always
one last mission.

47:01.490 --> 47:03.323
Take care.

47:43.573 --> 47:48.198

47:48.281 --> 47:53.031

Got a possible location

48:44.824 --> 48:46.824
You look like
you're havin' a bad day, mate.

48:47.657 --> 48:48.782
It's about to get worse.

48:49.532 --> 48:51.990
Let me go, your friends live.

48:52.824 --> 48:55.156
Cease fire!

48:55.615 --> 48:58.448
We have no leads.
I'm grateful we're all alive.

48:58.657 --> 49:00.240
We gave off cues to the intel.

49:01.156 --> 49:03.782
Probably sound a lot like
the same cues for,
"Please stop hitting me."

49:04.824 --> 49:06.490
Get down!
