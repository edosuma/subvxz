01:23.033 --> 01:25.801
Peg, you were great
last night.

01:25.801 --> 01:28.734
You did what every man dreams
his wife will do.

01:28.734 --> 01:30.234
You were asleep
before I got home

01:30.234 --> 01:33.200
and you were out of bed
before I woke up.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.100
How can I ever
thank you?

01:35.100 --> 01:37.634
You could stop eating beans
before bed.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.868
Hey, what's all this?

01:41.868 --> 01:43.167
I get breakfast too?

01:43.167 --> 01:44.567
Oh, Peg!

01:46.367 --> 01:47.934
Bring it on.

01:50.968 --> 01:52.968
Ooh, spices too?

01:52.968 --> 01:53.968
Do the kids
know about this?

01:53.968 --> 01:55.100
No.

01:55.100 --> 01:56.100
Good. Bring it on.

01:56.100 --> 01:58.200
Uh, Al, honey...
Yes, sweetheart?

01:58.200 --> 02:01.434
Before I serve you,
I have some great news.

02:01.434 --> 02:03.734
Oprah Winfrey finally exploded?

02:05.534 --> 02:08.334
[LAUGHS]

02:08.334 --> 02:11.701
Oh, no, Al,
but that's so funny.

02:11.701 --> 02:14.000
You're just
the greatest.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.501
Who's coming
to stay with us, Peg?

02:16.501 --> 02:18.701
Uh... Just my mother.

02:18.701 --> 02:20.501
No!

02:20.501 --> 02:22.767
And my uncles
Irwin and Otto.

02:22.767 --> 02:24.133
No, no!

02:24.133 --> 02:25.267
And the Wanker triplets.

02:25.267 --> 02:26.834
No, no, no!

02:26.834 --> 02:28.300
Oh, but Al,
they're my aunts.

02:28.300 --> 02:29.567
They're no trouble.

02:29.567 --> 02:31.200
Peg, God only knows
how old they are

02:31.200 --> 02:34.567
and they sleep in the same bed.

02:34.567 --> 02:36.000
It's amazing,

02:36.000 --> 02:38.934
the triplets sleep in one bed
and your mother sleeps in three.

02:38.934 --> 02:41.534
Well, honey, they'll only stay

02:41.534 --> 02:43.501
for an undetermined
period of time.

02:43.501 --> 02:45.868
Peg, now,
this is the first

02:45.868 --> 02:47.467
three-day weekend
I've had in a year.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.467
It's not like I'm going
to have a good time.

02:49.467 --> 02:51.801
You and the kids
are going to be there.

02:51.801 --> 02:53.400
Not the Wanker wagon
from Milwaukee.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.267
Peg, please, not that.

02:56.267 --> 02:58.067
 <i>Hondo</i> is going to be on
this weekend.

02:58.067 --> 02:59.868
Now, that's some
of the duke's best work.

02:59.868 --> 03:02.467
It's never on TV.
I got a blank tape already.

03:02.467 --> 03:04.033
I want to watch <i>Hondo,</i> Peg.

03:04.033 --> 03:05.601
I want a clean tape of <i>Hondo.</i>

03:05.601 --> 03:08.567
No one is going to interrupt you
watching <i>Hondo.</i>

03:08.567 --> 03:11.334
Remember when they were here
last year?

03:11.334 --> 03:12.501
 <i>Shane</i> was on.

03:12.501 --> 03:13.501
Just before it came on,

03:13.501 --> 03:14.734
Uncle Otto bet Uncle Irwin

03:14.734 --> 03:17.234
he couldn't stick his head
through the TV.

03:17.234 --> 03:19.801
I didn't see <i>Shane</i> that year,
Peg.

03:19.801 --> 03:21.501
Well, I know, Al,

03:21.501 --> 03:25.200
but you saw the end
from the emergency room.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.100
"Come back, Shane, Shane.
Goodbye, Shane."

03:27.100 --> 03:28.434
That's all I saw, Peg.

03:30.901 --> 03:32.167
I didn't even see the credits

03:32.167 --> 03:35.067
because your mother lumbered
in front of the set.

03:35.067 --> 03:36.901
By the time her entire body
chugged by,

03:36.901 --> 03:39.801
it was morning.

03:39.801 --> 03:42.000
You know,
you should be nice to them, Al.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
After all,

03:43.000 --> 03:44.534
they're the only people
in the world

03:44.534 --> 03:47.267
who think what you do
is skilled labor.

03:48.801 --> 03:52.968
Oh, what do you say, Al?
Can my family come for a visit?

03:52.968 --> 03:53.934
Because they're on their way.

03:56.701 --> 04:00.400
Since you went
to all this trouble, why not?

04:00.400 --> 04:01.467
All right, where's breakfast?

04:01.467 --> 04:04.167
Gee, I don't know.
I didn't cook anything.

04:05.801 --> 04:07.133
[CAR ARRIVES,
METAL CLANGING]

04:07.133 --> 04:11.501
Well, that's the sound
of the axle hitting the road.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.167
It means one of two things.

04:13.167 --> 04:15.734
Either everybody in China
just jumped off a chair,

04:15.734 --> 04:17.334
or your family's here.

04:19.466 --> 04:22.033
They brought the horse trailer.
Your mom in there, Peg?

04:24.634 --> 04:27.267
It's the only way
that she can travel, Al.

04:30.634 --> 04:32.300
Otto!

04:32.300 --> 04:33.501
Peggy!

04:35.501 --> 04:38.033
Your home still looks
like a filth hole.

04:41.234 --> 04:42.501
Irwin!

04:42.501 --> 04:43.667
Peg.

04:43.667 --> 04:45.200
You've got a beautiful home.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.801
PEGGY: Aw!

04:46.801 --> 04:51.634
And Milly, Elena, Eadie!

04:51.634 --> 04:54.567
AUNTS: Hi, Peggy.
We're triplets, you know.

04:54.567 --> 04:56.400
You look fabulous.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.901
Oh!

04:57.901 --> 04:59.033
Where's Mom?

04:59.033 --> 05:01.234
Oh, we're going
to have to leave her in the sun

05:01.234 --> 05:03.033
until she heats up
and gets slippery.

05:03.033 --> 05:05.701
That way, we won't have
to damage the truck

05:05.701 --> 05:08.567
getting her out.

05:08.567 --> 05:13.033
Somebody left
the WD-40 at home.

05:13.033 --> 05:16.300
Somebody didn't put it
on the list.

05:16.300 --> 05:17.534
How am I doing?

05:17.534 --> 05:20.634
Oh, I'm pretty good.
Thank you for asking.

05:20.634 --> 05:21.801
Now, listen,

05:21.801 --> 05:24.901
before the festival
of the inbreds starts,

05:24.901 --> 05:28.234
I want everybody to know
that <i>Hondo</i> will be coming on.

05:28.234 --> 05:29.634
During <i>Hondo,</i>

05:29.634 --> 05:31.501
there will be no belly butting,

05:31.501 --> 05:33.000
no spitting for distance,

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
and no one running around

05:34.000 --> 05:35.868
with underwear
on their heads.

05:38.334 --> 05:41.100
We could've gone
to a hotel.

05:41.100 --> 05:43.734
Hey, look who's here!
Hey!

05:43.734 --> 05:45.968
Uncle Irwin!

05:45.968 --> 05:47.367

05:49.033 --> 05:50.901
Uncle Otto.

05:50.901 --> 05:52.400
Oh!

05:52.400 --> 05:54.167
You look great.

05:54.167 --> 05:58.601
And you, my darling...
I could sell you.

05:58.601 --> 06:01.901
Let me tell you
what the going rate is.

06:03.501 --> 06:05.667
As you can see, Bud
hasn't changed a bit.

06:05.667 --> 06:09.267
Same wit, same zit,
same underwear.

06:09.267 --> 06:11.400
Well, now that
we're all together,

06:11.400 --> 06:13.133
how about
a hootenanny?

06:13.133 --> 06:14.968
No. God, no, no!

06:14.968 --> 06:17.334
Wait, wait, wait!
No hootenanny.

06:17.334 --> 06:19.200
See, I forgot to put that
on the list.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.033
* You are my sunshine *
Too late, Al.

06:21.033 --> 06:22.968
* My only sunshine *

Just like
the old days.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.901
Before music.

06:59.901 --> 07:01.100
Uncle Irwin,

07:01.100 --> 07:03.300
are you going to put
your head through the TV again?

07:03.300 --> 07:04.701
If you're good.

07:06.534 --> 07:08.133
Can I relax now?

07:08.133 --> 07:10.234
* She's a good-hearted woman *

07:10.234 --> 07:15.367
* In love with
A two-timin' man *

07:15.367 --> 07:17.701
* She loves him
In spite of his ways *

07:17.701 --> 07:21.868
* She don't understand *

07:21.868 --> 07:23.701
* Through teardrops
And laughter *

07:23.701 --> 07:28.634
* They'll dance through
This world hand in hand *

07:28.634 --> 07:30.367
* She's a good-hearted woman-- *

07:30.367 --> 07:31.400
Stop. Stop.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.868
Please stop.

07:37.467 --> 07:40.467
I'm not a Wanker,
and you're killing me.

07:42.234 --> 07:43.834
Peggy, we're famished.

07:53.234 --> 07:56.501
Al, how about
taking us out to eat?

07:56.501 --> 07:57.901
Ah, what the hell.

07:57.901 --> 08:00.100
Kids, you didn't really
want to go to college, did you?

08:00.100 --> 08:02.267
We'd rather eat.

08:02.267 --> 08:05.000
Well, if we're going to go,
we'd better get going,

08:05.000 --> 08:06.400
because once we unload
your mom,

08:06.400 --> 08:09.000
it's harder than hell
to squeeze her back in.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.467
She kicks like a mule.

08:10.467 --> 08:12.634
Uncle Irwin, are you going
to put your head

08:12.634 --> 08:13.734
in the salad bar again?

08:13.734 --> 08:15.801
If you're good.

08:19.634 --> 08:22.834
You know, you're not good enough
for our family.

08:24.901 --> 08:27.434
Yeah, right. I've never been up
on a morals charge.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.567
999...

08:31.567 --> 08:32.900
1000!

08:32.900 --> 08:34.000
He did it!

08:34.000 --> 08:35.400
[CHEERING]

08:35.400 --> 08:37.734
Oh, nice example
for the children, Irwin.

08:37.734 --> 08:40.933
Why don't you show them
how to de-bone a cow

08:40.933 --> 08:42.634
while you're at it?

08:42.634 --> 08:46.167
You've always been jealous
of me.

08:46.167 --> 08:49.501
Oh, yes, I've always secretly
wanted to be a...

08:49.501 --> 08:51.234
Beast of burden.

08:52.601 --> 08:55.667
Oh, now, now.
Let's not spoil our good time.

08:55.667 --> 08:57.801
Now, make up, you two.

08:57.801 --> 08:58.801
Blowfish!

08:58.801 --> 09:00.334
Squid!

09:00.334 --> 09:01.701
Well, that's better.

09:04.067 --> 09:06.467
Hey, Mom, are we going to go
down to the pony rides

09:06.467 --> 09:08.067
to see the look
on the horse's face

09:08.067 --> 09:10.300
when Uncle Irwin
chooses his mount?

09:10.300 --> 09:12.834
No, not today, honey.

09:12.834 --> 09:15.300
Ever since Daddy paid for lunch
with his watch,

09:15.300 --> 09:18.267
he's been sort of a crab apple.

09:18.267 --> 09:20.267
I think
he's mad at us.

09:20.267 --> 09:21.767
Oh, well, don't
take it personally.

09:21.767 --> 09:23.467
Daddy always
takes a noose with him

09:23.467 --> 09:24.400
into the bathroom.

09:25.801 --> 09:28.868
Uh-oh. Daddy's
in the bathroom?

09:28.868 --> 09:32.133
Mom's up there
taking a bath.

09:32.133 --> 09:34.667
Well, maybe
he won't notice.

09:34.667 --> 09:37.033
AL: Aah!

09:39.167 --> 09:41.968
Peg, I'm blind!

09:44.601 --> 09:46.167
Very funny, Al.

09:46.167 --> 09:47.567
No, really, Peg.

09:47.567 --> 09:49.701
I saw your mother naked, and...

09:51.334 --> 09:52.834
And everything went black.

09:52.834 --> 09:55.534
I think my eyes were trying
to protect my heart.

09:57.334 --> 10:00.501
Now I'm not going
to see <i>Hondo,</i> Peg.

10:00.501 --> 10:02.334
Stop being a baby.

10:02.334 --> 10:03.767
It's only hysterical
blindness.

10:03.767 --> 10:05.767
It happened
to her doctor.

10:05.767 --> 10:07.834
It wears off
eventually.

10:07.834 --> 10:09.000
Wait a second.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.801
I think it's starting
to come back to me.

10:10.801 --> 10:15.367
I see shapes.
I see... Straw.

10:15.367 --> 10:17.367
Oh, Kelly.

10:19.701 --> 10:21.601
Al, we have to talk.

10:21.601 --> 10:23.000
Well, I'm broke
and I'm blind, Peg.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.334
What else is there
to talk about?

10:25.334 --> 10:27.968
Well, you haven't been very nice
to my family.

10:27.968 --> 10:29.534
Well, neither is nature.
Go bother it.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.801
Now, Al, you know
I don't ask much of you

10:36.801 --> 10:39.801
because I know
how severely limited you are,

10:39.801 --> 10:43.367
but please do me a favor
and just say something to them.

10:43.367 --> 10:46.300
Yeah. Go home.

10:46.300 --> 10:48.634
Does that take care of it, Peg?

10:48.634 --> 10:50.234
That's a nice start.

10:50.234 --> 10:51.968
Just show them that you care.

10:51.968 --> 10:55.334
Go home
and drive safely.

10:57.701 --> 11:01.334
Ask them how they're doing.
For me, sweetums.

11:01.334 --> 11:02.767
That's all
I have to do, Peg?

11:02.767 --> 11:04.167
That's it.

11:04.167 --> 11:05.801
Otto, Irwin,
how you doing?

11:05.801 --> 11:09.067
We're desolate.

11:09.067 --> 11:10.501
We'll need the triplets.

11:10.501 --> 11:11.501
I'll get them.

11:11.501 --> 11:13.100
I told them to sleep
in Kelly's room.

11:13.100 --> 11:15.367
Her bed is used to having
a lot of people on it.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.334
Well, I guess that means

11:18.334 --> 11:20.133
Irwin and Otto get to sleep
on your bed,

11:20.133 --> 11:22.767
with the rotting rubber sheets.

11:22.767 --> 11:26.367
Al, I want to let you in
on a little family secret.

11:26.367 --> 11:27.801
You're the fourth
triplet?

11:29.467 --> 11:32.667
Well, I know everybody thinks
that the family income

11:32.667 --> 11:35.167
is derived primarily
from the still.

11:35.167 --> 11:37.300
And the home
yogurt business.

11:37.300 --> 11:40.400
Quiet, Mr. Pork-at-the-bottom.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.100
It'll catch on.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.567
Oh, please.

11:43.567 --> 11:46.634
Anyhow, the triplets
add greatly to our income.

11:46.634 --> 11:49.534
Otto, excuse me.

11:49.534 --> 11:51.868
Kelly, go upstairs.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.868
They sing!

11:54.868 --> 11:56.868
They sing at carnivals,
beer fests.

11:56.868 --> 11:58.868
Last month,
they worked regular

11:58.868 --> 12:00.834
and cleared a neat 88.50.

12:00.834 --> 12:02.868
Don't tell the IRS.

12:02.868 --> 12:04.601
Now something's happened
that's threatened the act.

12:06.667 --> 12:08.667
They faced
the audience?

12:11.434 --> 12:15.300
Elena, tell him
what you want to do.

12:15.300 --> 12:16.834
I want to marry.

12:16.834 --> 12:20.067
Somebody outside the family,
right?

12:20.067 --> 12:22.968
Well, in Wanker county,

12:22.968 --> 12:26.434
nobody's really
outside the family.

12:26.434 --> 12:28.634
Um...

12:28.634 --> 12:33.467
Well, how about that boy John
who works at the feed store?

12:33.467 --> 12:35.467
Yeah.

12:35.467 --> 12:37.634
I guess he's family.

12:43.367 --> 12:45.834
Will someone listen to me,
please?

12:45.834 --> 12:47.834
Peg, if Elena gets married,

12:47.834 --> 12:49.634
the triplets
will be torn asunder.

12:49.634 --> 12:51.868
And worse,
if she goes on a honeymoon,

12:51.868 --> 12:54.434
we'll lose 17 gigs.

12:54.434 --> 12:56.267
That's $34 and change.

12:56.267 --> 12:57.400
Interest will wane.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.267
Oh, my God,
the public will forget.

12:59.267 --> 13:00.367
It happens!

13:00.367 --> 13:01.467

Oh, Al, don't let
that happen.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.033
Oh, gee,
it's a little late, Peg.

13:07.033 --> 13:09.234
Glen's career
is what it is.

can solve this, you can.

Solve what?

13:19.033 --> 13:20.868
Should she marry or not?

13:20.868 --> 13:22.501
Peg, I'm not touching this,

They need you.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.467

All right, I'll help,
but I'm not looking at them.

13:41.367 --> 13:44.067
Elena, did you
actually find

13:44.067 --> 13:45.067
someone willing
to marry you?

13:45.067 --> 13:46.167

I ask you

 <i>just leave it</i>
 <i>in the machine?</i>

20:39.133 --> 20:45.901
BOTH: * <i>You are so beautiful</i>
 <i>To me *</i>

20:51.968 --> 20:53.767
You didn't hide it,
did you?

20:55.501 --> 21:00.400
Oh, Al, why don't you do
sweet things like that?

21:00.400 --> 21:02.801
Okay, I'll be the one to say it.
The duke is dead.

21:02.801 --> 21:04.534
Now, let's move on
to the living.

21:04.534 --> 21:06.133
Have you girls
come to your senses yet

21:06.133 --> 21:07.534
about this marriage?

21:09.367 --> 21:11.133
I'm devastated.

21:12.734 --> 21:14.834
This is your fault.

21:14.834 --> 21:15.868
You're the one

21:15.868 --> 21:17.367
that invited her fiance
to the house.

21:17.367 --> 21:18.901
We were gonna roll him.

21:18.901 --> 21:20.367
Look what happened.

21:20.367 --> 21:24.367
And you never even
got his wallet.

21:24.367 --> 21:25.968
Or did you?

21:35.701 --> 21:38.133
That's it! Sit down.

21:38.133 --> 21:41.501
Everybody sit down,
because I'm taking charge now.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.501
Peg, kids, go upstairs,

21:43.501 --> 21:46.601
because I'm solving
everybody's problems now.

21:46.601 --> 21:49.868
Everybody,
move close together...

21:49.868 --> 21:54.801
And say... "Swiss cheese."

22:03.033 --> 22:05.634
Al?

22:05.634 --> 22:06.634
Honey, you're sweating.

22:06.634 --> 22:09.000
And you haven't
answered me yet.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.434
Is it okay if my family
comes for a visit?

22:11.434 --> 22:12.701
[DOORBELL RINGS]

22:12.701 --> 22:14.634
Well, it doesn't
really matter what you say.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.534
Besides,
how bad can it be?

22:19.634 --> 22:21.434
We're here!
