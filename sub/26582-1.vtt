01:51.402 --> 01:54.823
You have to call him at least three times
until he answers.

01:54.906 --> 01:58.368
Hey, I have some breaking news.

01:58.868 --> 02:01.996
Do you remember the dog
we ran over the other day?

02:03.289 --> 02:04.290
Guess what?

02:05.917 --> 02:08.294
It's alive!
The dog is alive.

02:08.378 --> 02:11.631
We ran it over and thought it was dead,
but it's alive.

02:11.714 --> 02:13.550
It's like Highlander.

02:13.633 --> 02:16.136
Thank God we didn't bury it, right?

02:17.137 --> 02:18.972
What happened? Change of plans?

02:19.639 --> 02:21.015
I couldn't make dinner.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.936
It's early.
Should we order something?

02:25.019 --> 02:27.438
I couldn't cook
because I heard voices in the kitchen.

02:31.776 --> 02:33.069
Here? In the kitchen?

02:49.627 --> 02:51.045
I know what I heard.

02:51.754 --> 02:53.464
I heard it all the afternoon.

02:53.673 --> 02:54.757
They were talking.

02:57.427 --> 03:00.096
The plumbling is old.
Maybe the pipes squeal.

03:02.056 --> 03:03.725
What do you think you heard?

03:05.101 --> 03:08.354
Besides Walter, the neighbour,
is repairing his house.

03:08.438 --> 03:11.149
There's noise here all the time.

03:12.817 --> 03:15.612
Has he made any noise today?
Have you heard him?

03:20.825 --> 03:22.368
Don't be scared.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.579
They were human voices.

03:27.373 --> 03:28.750
What did they tell you?

03:32.503 --> 03:33.963
That they were going to kill me.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.084
Son of a bitch!

04:21.469 --> 04:23.721
You shouldn't bang at this time!

04:45.576 --> 04:47.036
Stop banging!

04:47.120 --> 04:49.080
Stop making noise, asshole!

04:49.163 --> 04:50.915
Stop it!

04:58.298 --> 05:00.300
Now, you're gonna listen to me,
motherfucker.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.113
Answer me, damn it.

05:25.241 --> 05:26.075
Walter?

05:28.244 --> 05:29.078
Walter.

05:30.663 --> 05:31.789
Walter, it's Juan!

05:34.417 --> 05:37.045
I know you're there, asshole,
I can hear you.

05:40.923 --> 05:44.093
I can hear you! Come on, is that you?

05:46.471 --> 05:48.514
Can you stop banging on the wall?

05:50.016 --> 05:53.978
Stop banging on the wall, asshole.
I can hear it from my house.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.898
It's 5 a.m.! Are you nuts?

05:58.691 --> 06:00.568
Do you want me to call the police?

06:01.736 --> 06:02.570
You jerk!

06:10.745 --> 06:13.664
Your fucking neighbor
is smashing the walls at 5 a.m.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.259
That's not Walter.

06:28.971 --> 06:30.098
Clara, is that you?

06:32.600 --> 06:33.976
You the one who's banging?

06:39.232 --> 06:40.066
Clara?

06:59.419 --> 07:00.503
Stop it, Clara!

07:00.962 --> 07:02.130
No, Clara!

07:03.923 --> 07:04.966
Clara!

07:10.179 --> 07:11.389
Honey!

07:12.432 --> 07:14.183
Stop it! Clara!

07:14.392 --> 07:16.060
What is wrong with you?

07:16.144 --> 07:16.978
Stop it!

07:18.396 --> 07:20.398
Stop it, that's enough!

07:20.773 --> 07:22.775
Clara!

07:23.651 --> 07:25.653
What's happening? That's enough!

07:25.736 --> 07:26.696
Stop it.

07:26.821 --> 07:29.365
Enough! Stop it!

07:29.449 --> 07:31.451
Stop it!

07:34.245 --> 07:36.247
Clara, what's happening?

07:37.331 --> 07:38.875
Stop it, Clara!

07:53.723 --> 07:57.185
Mr. Blumetti, we want
to take you out of here.

07:59.228 --> 08:00.938
We believe you.

08:01.772 --> 08:04.025
But you'll have to cooperate with us.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.153
Have you talked to my lawyer?

08:08.446 --> 08:09.447
Yes, we have.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.700
But it seems that he doesn't believe us.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.583
I've already seen the pictures.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.794
No, not these ones.
You have never seen these pictures.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.963
We know that you didn't kill your wife.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.841
We don't have concrete evidence.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.219
But we'll be working on it.

08:32.428 --> 08:34.430
Look at the pictures, Mr. Blumetti.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.649
That's not Clara.

08:45.691 --> 08:46.943
That's not your wife.

08:49.904 --> 08:55.159
In 1998, in the United States,
there was a case very similar to yours.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.661
Almost identical.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.039
Was it cleared up?

09:02.875 --> 09:06.837
We need to know
everything you remember from that moment.

09:07.338 --> 09:09.173
I've already told it to the prosecutor.

09:09.799 --> 09:14.554
Everything you remember
from the last two weeks in your...

09:16.639 --> 09:18.766
-In your neighborhood.
-Neighborhood.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.436
Was there anything unusual?

09:30.403 --> 09:32.488
The accident outside my house.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.414
I don't know.
My neighbor Walter...

09:43.082 --> 09:44.584
was very annoying.

09:45.126 --> 09:48.838
He was doing home repairs at any time.

09:49.547 --> 09:50.381
Repairs?

09:51.465 --> 09:53.467
Your neighbor, Walter.

09:54.385 --> 09:55.595
Walter Carabajal.

10:00.182 --> 10:01.225
Hello?

10:01.517 --> 10:04.312
Hello.
May I speak with Dr. Albreck, please?

10:06.230 --> 10:07.064
Who is it?

10:07.148 --> 10:08.816
I'm Walter Carabajal.

10:10.067 --> 10:13.237
The doctor is not available now.
Would you like to leave her message?

10:13.321 --> 10:15.031
No.

10:15.156 --> 10:17.158
I need to speak to her.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.411
I have some issues at home.

10:20.786 --> 10:22.788
It has been a few months now.

10:23.956 --> 10:28.878
At first, I thought it was me,
but then it got worse.

10:29.670 --> 10:32.632
It's hard to explain it on the phone.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.176
Who gave you this number, Mr. Carabajal?

10:36.010 --> 10:39.972
I've seen some specialists

10:40.097 --> 10:42.600
and several agreed
on giving me this number.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.561
I'm afraid
you'll have to call again tomorrow.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.521
Okay.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.357
I'm calling again tomorrow.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.942
Could you tell her I called, please?

14:02.758 --> 14:04.301
Please, please.

14:51.223 --> 14:52.182
Hello?

14:52.266 --> 14:54.268
Hi. It's Walter Carabajal.

14:55.352 --> 14:56.729
I need help, please.

14:56.812 --> 15:00.524
I haven't slept in weeks.
And my meds are not having any effect.

15:00.649 --> 15:02.484
I'm in a difficult situation.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.281
Tell the doctor that I saw it.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.326
It's not longer noise, banging
or moving things.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.953
I saw it yesterday.
I think it came from under the bed.

15:13.245 --> 15:17.374
The doctor can't treat you now.
She can't accept your case.

15:17.625 --> 15:18.918
I'm asking it nicely!

15:20.419 --> 15:23.297
I need to speak to her immediately.

15:23.756 --> 15:24.882
I'm going crazy.

15:27.301 --> 15:30.137
We can refer you to another specialist.

15:30.387 --> 15:33.098
No, no!
I've already talked to all of them.

15:33.182 --> 15:36.352
And they all say the doctor
is the only one who can help me.

15:37.019 --> 15:37.937
I can afford it.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.814
I'll do whatever is necessary,
just tell me.

15:41.315 --> 15:42.399
Please!

15:43.817 --> 15:48.364
The doctor does not accept any cases
without analyzing the evidence in person.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.491
But she cannot do it at the moment.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.244
How can I give evidence
if it can't be seen?

15:55.454 --> 15:58.916
I'm sorry, Mr. Carabajal.
We cannot help you.

16:06.006 --> 16:07.383
Walter!

16:09.426 --> 16:10.511
Hey.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.222
What's wrong with your house?

16:13.305 --> 16:14.139
Why?

16:14.974 --> 16:16.976
Why? You cracked my wall.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.269
There's banging all the time.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.231
I'm doing some remodeling.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.775
Some repairs.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.945
You cracked my wall.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

16:34.284 --> 16:35.536
You want evidence?

16:36.078 --> 16:37.663
I'm giving you evidence.

19:52.524 --> 19:53.650
Who are you?

19:55.903 --> 19:56.987
Who are you?

20:45.702 --> 20:46.662
Hey!

20:46.912 --> 20:48.288
What are you doing?

20:48.372 --> 20:50.540
Don't drink that water.
Get out of my house.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.834
I don't want to see you around here.

20:53.293 --> 20:55.045
Do you hear me?

20:55.212 --> 20:58.006
I'm saying it for your own good.
Get away from my house.

21:10.602 --> 21:11.728
What happened?

21:18.026 --> 21:20.028
-And?
-There was an accident.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.169
Alicia!

21:39.631 --> 21:40.590
Alicia!

21:45.345 --> 21:46.346
Alicia!

22:18.670 --> 22:20.547
Call me if you need anything.

22:21.465 --> 22:22.466
Thank you.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.117
Hello?

22:49.242 --> 22:51.244
Jano, it's Funes.

22:52.537 --> 22:53.914
Funes?

22:54.247 --> 22:55.457
Ramón?

22:55.540 --> 22:58.752
I'm sorry for calling you this late,
but it's...

22:59.711 --> 23:01.088
as you can imagine...

23:01.922 --> 23:03.298
very important.

23:04.341 --> 23:05.717
Don't worry.

23:06.676 --> 23:07.969
What's going on?

23:08.053 --> 23:10.013
Four days ago, there was an accident.

23:10.097 --> 23:14.267
A ten-year-old kid was ran over
and he died on his doorstep.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.271
I need you here, Jano.

23:18.897 --> 23:20.357
I need you to come over.

23:20.982 --> 23:23.193
Okay.

23:23.527 --> 23:26.154
I'm sending a patrol car to pick you up.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.198
It'll arrive in approximately an hour.

23:29.199 --> 23:30.325
That's okay.

23:30.409 --> 23:33.245
You're the only one
who can tell me what's happening here.

24:06.820 --> 24:07.821
Who's there?

24:38.602 --> 24:40.020
It's pretty late, right?

24:41.396 --> 24:42.772
Pardon me?

24:45.984 --> 24:47.402
Are you feeling alright?

25:00.540 --> 25:02.542
POLICE

25:10.550 --> 25:11.676
Hi, Jano.

25:13.261 --> 25:14.638
Is it inside?

25:19.226 --> 25:20.769
Nothing scares you, right?

25:22.687 --> 25:23.939
You never know.

25:24.397 --> 25:25.440
Let's see.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.537
He's sitting there.

25:40.205 --> 25:42.415
He's officer Guzmán. You know him.

25:43.542 --> 25:46.503
And Officer Picarel. They're trustworthy.

25:46.586 --> 25:48.713
They were doing a routine patrol,

25:49.548 --> 25:52.842
they saw the door opened,
they entered and found her in that state.

25:52.926 --> 25:53.843
Boss...

25:55.011 --> 25:56.388
should we wait outside?

25:59.391 --> 26:00.767
Yes, you can go.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.192
They're frightened.

26:09.734 --> 26:11.111
And with good reason.

26:18.952 --> 26:19.995
Jano...

26:21.037 --> 26:23.331
the child died four days ago.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.626
I was at the burial, I went to the wake.

26:27.961 --> 26:29.337
Do you get it?

26:36.219 --> 26:40.765
He appeared all of the sudden
and he sat there with us.

27:04.664 --> 27:05.665
Is it him?

27:09.169 --> 27:10.629
The officers declared...

27:13.089 --> 27:15.008
that they saw him move.

27:17.552 --> 27:20.805
I also thought I'd seen him move,
I swear you.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.807
It has a rotten smell.

28:09.729 --> 28:11.523
Yes, it has a bad smell.

28:14.067 --> 28:19.614
Do you believe Alicia
may have mounted all this?

28:20.740 --> 28:22.659
Take a look at his hands, Funes.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.327
They're destroyed.

28:27.122 --> 28:29.499
He scratched the spoil for several days.

28:38.383 --> 28:39.509
You know what?

28:42.303 --> 28:44.639
There are a lot of cases
of desecration of graves

28:44.723 --> 28:46.891
carried out by the relatives
of the deceased.

28:47.475 --> 28:51.229
Some people cannot stand the idea
that their child is dead.

28:51.771 --> 28:55.483
And some of them even steal the corpse.

28:57.235 --> 29:01.906
I think we should analyze
the mother's clothes.

29:01.990 --> 29:07.620
We may find a bacterial infection
or some cadaverous flora or fauna.

29:10.290 --> 29:12.459
You really don't know. You're hesitating.

29:12.542 --> 29:13.418
Yes.

29:14.502 --> 29:18.047
I have some serious doubts
about whether this is one of those cases.

29:21.426 --> 29:24.053
You can give the explanation
I just gave you.

29:24.971 --> 29:27.307
You weren't expecting this answer from me.

29:27.390 --> 29:28.224
No.

29:29.225 --> 29:32.729
And that's okay.
Because that's not the answer.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.523
But it's the one you should give.

29:45.033 --> 29:47.035
Do you know the mother?

29:47.243 --> 29:48.328
What?

29:48.870 --> 29:50.872
I said, "Do you know the mother?"

29:53.625 --> 29:54.542
Yes, very well.

29:58.505 --> 30:00.507
We had a relationship...

30:02.217 --> 30:05.345
a very nice once for several years.

30:16.356 --> 30:17.649
He moved.

30:26.199 --> 30:30.203
Did he have the arm on the table
like it is now?

30:32.247 --> 30:33.289
I think so.

30:33.748 --> 30:35.750
You think? Jano!

30:37.752 --> 30:39.295
Have you taken any pictures?

30:39.671 --> 30:41.130
No, we haven't done anything.

30:43.758 --> 30:46.803
-And you shouldn't do anything.
-What do you mean?

30:46.886 --> 30:48.888
Exactly that. We shouldn't do anything.

30:50.014 --> 30:52.267
The best thing to do
is bury him again.

30:54.060 --> 30:54.894
Yeah, right.

30:57.188 --> 30:58.606
Bury him?

31:00.441 --> 31:02.360
Are you drunk, Jano?

31:02.902 --> 31:04.445
Let me be clear, Funes.

31:05.780 --> 31:09.909
I guess you're aware
about the trouble this may cause.

31:10.577 --> 31:11.911
I suppose you know it.

31:11.995 --> 31:14.581
For example, if the Prosecutor intervenes,

31:14.664 --> 31:17.667
your friend will be locked up
in a mental hospital.

31:18.042 --> 31:21.296
And given the context,
she'll spend several years there.

31:21.504 --> 31:24.340
We should try to find a way
to avoid that, right?

31:27.886 --> 31:29.888
What do I say to my people?

31:34.976 --> 31:37.145
Postmortem spasm...

31:37.979 --> 31:41.524
caused by a build-up of gases.

31:41.941 --> 31:43.943
It's a decomposing body.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.329
We should get injectable Valium.

31:54.412 --> 31:58.333
It's better for your friend to be sleeping
before we take his son.

31:58.875 --> 32:00.877
Don't turn the lights off again.

32:18.728 --> 32:20.730
What's going on, kiddo?

32:22.982 --> 32:25.109
Why did you come to visit us?

32:27.111 --> 32:28.571
What brought you here?

32:52.512 --> 32:54.514
I must call my sister.

32:56.307 --> 32:58.309
She has to notify the priest.

33:00.353 --> 33:03.690
I don't want you to take him, please.

33:03.773 --> 33:05.650
Don't take my baby again.

33:28.756 --> 33:30.258
Excuse me, do I know you?

33:32.218 --> 33:34.554
I see you're taking pictures.

33:36.055 --> 33:38.099
I think I know you from somewhere else.

33:39.058 --> 33:41.185
Aren't you Mora Albreck?

33:44.564 --> 33:45.690
Yes, Dr. Albreck.

33:46.649 --> 33:47.608
And you are?

33:48.776 --> 33:51.529
I can't believe
that I'm meeting you in person.

33:52.572 --> 33:54.115
I'm Mario Jano.

33:54.198 --> 33:56.325
-Pleased to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

33:56.409 --> 33:58.411
I attended several of your lectures.

33:59.078 --> 34:01.080
About paranormal events, meta-symbiosis.

34:02.498 --> 34:05.043
What are you searching for here?
May I help you?

34:06.002 --> 34:06.878
Is this here?

34:09.172 --> 34:10.048
Yes.

34:12.467 --> 34:13.342
It's weird.

34:14.135 --> 34:15.511
I ring the intercom,

34:16.137 --> 34:18.973
it seems that someone answers,
but nobody speaks.

34:20.099 --> 34:21.684
Nobody picks up the phone.

34:22.769 --> 34:26.147
Do you know Mr. Carabajal?
Have you seen him lately?

34:27.940 --> 34:28.816
No.

34:29.275 --> 34:30.568
No, the thing is...

34:32.028 --> 34:34.030
I don't live here, either.

34:34.697 --> 34:36.824
This is not pure chance.

34:37.867 --> 34:40.870
If I were to ask you to join me,

34:41.162 --> 34:42.163
would you accept?

34:43.039 --> 34:45.917
You'll find it interesting.
I'm sure about that.

35:01.224 --> 35:06.187
Funes, this is Dr. Albreck,
a colleague, a true expert.

35:07.105 --> 35:10.441
-Can I talk to you for a moment?
-Yes. Excuse me.

35:14.487 --> 35:16.114
-Did you call her?
-No.

35:16.197 --> 35:18.908
-You didn't?
-No, but this isn't a coincidence.

35:19.742 --> 35:23.121
It doesn't matter.
We won't be able to transport the body.

35:23.204 --> 35:24.038
Why not?

35:24.455 --> 35:25.873
We're in broad daylight.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.209
It's complicated. People will see us.

35:28.793 --> 35:31.796
You telling me that you
can't handle the cemetery issue?

35:31.879 --> 35:34.632
-You're the superintendent.
-It's not about that.

35:35.091 --> 35:38.344
There are cars, people.
They'll see us with the kid.

35:38.427 --> 35:39.428
I'm not doing it.

35:39.554 --> 35:42.098
I think this is the correct alternative.

35:43.349 --> 35:44.350
-Is it?
-Yes.

35:44.600 --> 35:45.434
Really?

35:45.518 --> 35:47.520
Hey! She's taking pictures.

35:47.603 --> 35:49.564
Yes. She knows what she's doing.

35:49.647 --> 35:51.649
-Jano, she's taking pictures.
-Trust me.

35:51.732 --> 35:54.360
She knows what she's doing.
Trust me, please.

35:55.236 --> 35:58.281
-Are you aware about my health issues?
-Yes, I am.

35:59.073 --> 36:01.284
I'm retiring in two months.

36:01.701 --> 36:04.078
I haven't got a single stain in my file.

36:04.287 --> 36:06.956
Do you know the mess I can get into
because of this?

36:07.039 --> 36:08.833
-Do you?
-Listen to me, Funes.

36:08.916 --> 36:13.004
-This is the right choice.
-Alicia's friends are about to arrive.

36:13.087 --> 36:15.882
They're coming to drink mate.
The child's at the table.

36:15.965 --> 36:17.967
Will you listen to me, please?

36:19.135 --> 36:20.219
You haven't slept.

36:20.803 --> 36:21.762
You're stressed.

36:22.513 --> 36:23.848
You have to do this.

36:24.056 --> 36:25.725
Take the officers with you.

36:26.517 --> 36:29.228
Go to the cemetery to solve
the burial issue.

36:29.312 --> 36:33.482
Let me and Albreck handle this.
We'll take care of Alicia.

36:34.358 --> 36:36.777
And remove that patrol car

36:36.861 --> 36:40.406
before the neighbors start wondering
what's going on, please.

36:46.078 --> 36:47.580
What are you two hiding?

36:49.874 --> 36:51.500
Have you already seen this?

36:59.217 --> 37:01.219
I'll be back in a couple of hours.

37:01.302 --> 37:03.137
-Hey, listen!
-No, you listen to me.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.597
Are we doing things correctly?

37:05.348 --> 37:08.142
Yes. We need two bags of concrete mix.

37:09.268 --> 37:10.144
What for?

37:10.228 --> 37:13.189
What for?
Do you want him to leave his grave again?

37:15.024 --> 37:16.150
Fucking hell.

37:37.755 --> 37:38.923
That smell...

37:41.175 --> 37:42.510
A rotten smell.

37:43.344 --> 37:44.303
No.

37:45.888 --> 37:48.432
Not the smell of something rotten,
but of something dead.

37:51.185 --> 37:53.813
Now we're speaking the same language.

38:25.386 --> 38:28.306
Please, take a seat.
I want to tell you something.

38:33.519 --> 38:34.437
You know...

38:36.105 --> 38:39.066
I used to be a coroner.
I worked more than 15 years

38:39.400 --> 38:41.402
with superintendent Funes.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.572
I did a lot a of autopsies.

38:46.949 --> 38:48.451
And one day,

38:48.868 --> 38:50.911
I had to examine
the body of a young man.

38:50.995 --> 38:51.996
Twenty years old.

38:52.788 --> 38:54.582
He had 14 bullets in the head.

38:57.668 --> 38:59.670
I didn't have a choice.

39:00.254 --> 39:01.339
I had to remove...

39:04.467 --> 39:09.764
I scratched for five hours
in that guy's skull.

39:12.058 --> 39:13.100
One moment,

39:15.144 --> 39:16.228
he grabbed my arm.

39:17.355 --> 39:18.272
He squeezed me.

39:19.273 --> 39:21.233
He opened his eyes to look at me.

39:21.692 --> 39:22.610
He woke up.

39:26.781 --> 39:29.909
Actually, I thought
it was all a result of my stress.

39:31.702 --> 39:32.620
But it wasn't.

39:33.371 --> 39:38.084
The same thing happened
with an old man's body.

39:39.585 --> 39:41.420
He had been dead for two days.

39:42.296 --> 39:43.255
He woke up...

39:44.882 --> 39:45.841
looked at me...

39:47.343 --> 39:48.344
and talked to me.

39:54.850 --> 39:55.768
I...

39:56.560 --> 39:58.896
made the mistake of calling his family.

40:01.649 --> 40:03.442
The family went to the morgue.

40:05.569 --> 40:08.864
Can you imagine
what his son was going through?

40:11.033 --> 40:14.161
But these things happen.

40:14.453 --> 40:18.707
They happen when one comes across
things that don't belong in this world.

40:21.544 --> 40:22.628
I believe that...

40:23.129 --> 40:28.426
we should let them go
and play them down.

40:28.634 --> 40:32.179
At least, play down the importance
that we usually give them.

40:33.305 --> 40:38.894
The dead old man
blamed his own son for his death.

40:41.939 --> 40:44.567
-I believe I have read your book.
-Really?

40:45.734 --> 40:47.778
It was very well bound.

41:36.911 --> 41:39.663
Pardon me, why do you think
these pictures--

41:39.747 --> 41:40.748
They are genuine.

41:42.124 --> 41:44.627
Didn't cross the country for
photos of uncertain origin.

41:44.710 --> 41:49.715
I'm not saying that,
but it's a striking coincidence.

41:50.382 --> 41:52.426
Maybe it's not a coincidence.

41:53.844 --> 41:54.762
Mom!

42:01.852 --> 42:02.770
Someone got in.

42:15.449 --> 42:16.951
We have to move the body.

42:19.453 --> 42:21.205
PATRICIO NAVARRO
COMMUNICATION NOTEBOOK

42:37.012 --> 42:41.016
Nobody is going to believe that kid
when he tells this story.

42:50.067 --> 42:50.985
Just in case.

43:06.584 --> 43:07.835
She's still asleep.

43:10.045 --> 43:11.880
Yes, but not for long.

43:12.423 --> 43:13.716
We must move fast.

43:14.717 --> 43:16.969
I settled the cemetery issue.

43:19.471 --> 43:20.681
We had to move him.

43:22.474 --> 43:23.392
Where is he?

43:23.767 --> 43:24.685
In the freezer.

43:40.743 --> 43:41.869
Unplug it, Jano.

43:50.502 --> 43:52.338
Holy shit, Jano!

43:57.676 --> 44:00.471
We'll have to carry him with the freezer.

44:01.639 --> 44:05.142
You'll have to cooperate with us
if you don't want this to happen again.

44:15.653 --> 44:19.281
Fortunately, we have
the superintendent's approval.

44:20.949 --> 44:22.576
But that's not enough.

44:23.243 --> 44:25.079
We have to move forward

44:25.162 --> 44:28.374
and for that, we need you to sign
some authorizations.

44:28.999 --> 44:31.585
We'll need your house.

44:31.669 --> 44:34.171
I mean, to spend some nights there.

44:34.755 --> 44:37.174
But you have to authorize us.

44:39.718 --> 44:40.594
What for?

44:41.345 --> 44:43.347
To investigate, Mr. Blumetti.

44:43.430 --> 44:47.685
There have been some paranormal events
occurring in a same radio.

44:48.102 --> 44:50.312
And one of the vectors is your house.

44:50.521 --> 44:52.648
Your neighbors have given us
their approval,

44:52.731 --> 44:54.316
we are only missing yours now.

45:06.036 --> 45:07.454
Thank you, Mr. Blumetti.

45:09.164 --> 45:10.416
What does this mean?

45:11.667 --> 45:14.962
This means that we are going to divide us

45:15.504 --> 45:20.217
in each of the houses where we believe
the paranormal events are happening.

45:21.385 --> 45:26.098
Fortunately, Dr. Rosentok
is giving us his invaluable help.

45:27.766 --> 45:29.476
He's a colleague of Dr. Albreck's

45:29.560 --> 45:32.521
and has dealt with similar cases
in the United States

45:32.604 --> 45:34.148
and all across the continent.

45:38.402 --> 45:40.988
What happened to my neighbor Walter?

45:43.282 --> 45:44.825
There's no news about him.

45:45.784 --> 45:48.203
Nobody has heard from him in a long time.

45:50.664 --> 45:51.582
Well...

45:52.499 --> 45:53.417
good luck.

45:56.253 --> 45:57.629
I think you'll need it.

48:11.597 --> 48:12.931
You are...

48:14.725 --> 48:16.059
-Scared.
-That's right.

48:16.560 --> 48:17.436
Yeah.

48:19.104 --> 48:20.188
That's normal.

48:21.231 --> 48:22.441
I won't deny it.

48:23.942 --> 48:25.861
I won't deny it either.

48:27.279 --> 48:28.488
I'm also scared.

48:30.616 --> 48:31.533
Superintendent.

48:31.617 --> 48:33.702
We could enter without inconvenience.

48:33.785 --> 48:35.787
Good. You search the entire house?

48:35.871 --> 48:37.873
There's no power for lack of payment.

48:38.415 --> 48:40.918
I have connections.
I can ask someone to reconnect it.

48:41.001 --> 48:42.085
That's not necessary.

48:42.169 --> 48:45.422
It's better to have the lights off
to find what we're looking for.

48:47.424 --> 48:48.425
Okay.

48:48.967 --> 48:50.719
I see. Sure.

48:52.095 --> 48:53.472
We'll be in touch then.

49:02.356 --> 49:03.523
Rosentok?

49:06.026 --> 49:11.573
Could you specifically tell me
what we may find here?

49:12.950 --> 49:14.034
Noises.

49:14.993 --> 49:18.205
Some clues about what happened that night.

49:18.455 --> 49:19.539
A few days ago.

49:22.709 --> 49:23.752
You mean...

49:25.462 --> 49:27.089
just that, right?

49:30.467 --> 49:33.971
You don't have to spend the night here
if you don't want to.

49:40.936 --> 49:43.146
Fear is...

49:44.106 --> 49:45.399
con--

49:46.441 --> 49:48.443
-Contagious.
-Right.

49:55.492 --> 49:57.869
I have a problem, you know?

49:59.079 --> 50:01.456
I take anticoagulants.

50:01.581 --> 50:02.416
You know?

50:04.835 --> 50:09.256
And besides, I'm practically deaf.

50:09.673 --> 50:10.590
I mean...

50:14.428 --> 50:20.225
So, this is not the right place for you.

50:35.490 --> 50:36.408
Hello?

50:38.035 --> 50:38.952
Hello!

50:42.039 --> 50:44.041
Is that you, Albreck?

50:44.624 --> 50:45.542
Hello.

50:45.792 --> 50:47.002
Yes, I can hear you.

50:47.627 --> 50:49.588
Could I speak to Alicia?

50:50.088 --> 50:52.090
She's not here.

50:52.424 --> 50:55.969
She's been staying at her sister's house
for some weeks now.

50:56.595 --> 50:59.723
I can give you the telephone number
if you want.

51:00.015 --> 51:01.349
Can you write it down?

51:01.433 --> 51:02.350
Yes, tell me.

51:03.477 --> 51:05.270
Four, two, four, two,

51:06.063 --> 51:07.439
one, six, zero, three.

51:09.566 --> 51:10.484
Who's calling?

51:25.624 --> 51:27.793
Hi, Ali. It's Sarita.

51:28.001 --> 51:32.172
Listen, I'm calling you because
Patito came home without his backpack.

51:32.339 --> 51:37.219
He says he went to your place
to get some toys and dropped it there.

51:37.761 --> 51:41.181
Let me know if you see his backpack
over there. Bye.

52:04.496 --> 52:05.664
It's weird, right?

52:25.016 --> 52:27.561
Alicia, I need to talk to you.
It's urgent.

52:27.644 --> 52:30.564
Please, call me
as soon as you hear this message.

52:30.689 --> 52:31.940
It's urgent.

52:32.941 --> 52:34.025
It's Sara again.

52:34.109 --> 52:37.028
Please, Alicia,
I've been trying to reach you for days.

52:37.112 --> 52:40.699
Patricio recorded something very strange
with his cellphone.

52:40.782 --> 52:42.784
He recorded it on your backyard.

52:43.618 --> 52:46.037
He climbed the wall, as usual.

52:46.538 --> 52:48.540
I don't know how to tell you this.

52:48.832 --> 52:50.208
We're very frightened.

52:50.292 --> 52:53.879
You have to see this video.
It's connected to your son.

52:54.713 --> 52:57.674
It's also connected to your ex,
the police officer.

52:58.258 --> 53:00.719
I don't know what to do. Call me, please.

53:00.927 --> 53:03.054
I'll try to locate you somehow.

53:03.138 --> 53:05.849
It's very disturbing.
Call me back, please.

53:32.584 --> 53:33.752
Hold on!

53:34.878 --> 53:36.296
Hold on, hold on!

53:36.421 --> 53:38.423
Let me help you!

53:38.506 --> 53:40.175
The knife, the knife!

53:48.433 --> 53:50.435
It's...

53:54.022 --> 53:55.649
-It's...
-Sucking.

53:55.732 --> 53:57.734
It's sucking my blood.

54:00.070 --> 54:03.448
There's something in here...

54:04.824 --> 54:06.284
that's sucking...

54:27.222 --> 54:28.431
Don't shoot!

54:29.307 --> 54:30.934
No, don't shoot!

54:32.936 --> 54:34.187
-What?
-Help me!

54:35.230 --> 54:36.314
Holy shit!

54:42.404 --> 54:43.238
Funes.

54:43.321 --> 54:45.949
Things are getting rough here.

54:46.366 --> 54:47.701
Rosentok is injured.

54:48.410 --> 54:50.412
-Tell her I'm fine.
-Injured?

54:50.829 --> 54:52.831
He should get checked by a doctor.

54:56.918 --> 54:58.920
Albreck. Yes.

54:59.838 --> 55:01.673
We're on the right track.

55:03.800 --> 55:05.260
I'm glad to hear that.

55:07.262 --> 55:09.264
I think we're at the niche.

55:10.348 --> 55:12.350
-Niche?
-The nest!

55:12.976 --> 55:14.144
Inside the nest.

55:14.227 --> 55:17.897
I'm glad to hear that too.
I'm pleased to have you with us.

55:18.356 --> 55:19.816
I appreciate that.

55:21.151 --> 55:22.319
Talk to you later.

55:24.029 --> 55:25.655
You should clean the blood.

55:27.073 --> 55:30.702
It will take some time
for the painkiller to take effect.

55:31.828 --> 55:38.251
Meanwhile, you should
clean the blood that we left in the house.

55:38.376 --> 55:39.377
Me?

55:40.170 --> 55:43.173
-Why do I have to?
-We don't have time to waste!

55:43.256 --> 55:45.842
Time goes by quickly here.

56:23.463 --> 56:25.507
THIS NOTEBOOK
BELONGS TO PATRICIO NAVARRO

56:28.718 --> 56:30.804
SCHOOL No. 28, THIRD GRADE

56:49.906 --> 56:50.782
Hello?

56:51.199 --> 56:53.284
Jano, I'm out of this. I'm leaving.

56:54.536 --> 56:56.037
That's okay, don't worry.

56:56.246 --> 57:01.876
I'm so sorry, but you know,
I'm not good at this.

57:02.043 --> 57:03.378
It's okay, I get it.

57:03.628 --> 57:07.048
I have to be honest.
I'm shit-scared.

57:07.132 --> 57:09.134
And you know about my issues.

57:09.217 --> 57:11.219
I've seen some things here

57:11.344 --> 57:15.390
that don't have any explanation,
at least to me.

57:15.515 --> 57:16.850
Do you understand?

57:16.933 --> 57:18.059
-Funes.
-What?

57:18.977 --> 57:19.978
Where are you?

57:20.061 --> 57:23.022
I'm here. Where else could I be?

57:23.857 --> 57:25.608
Which part of the house?

57:26.693 --> 57:27.819
In the kitchen.

57:27.902 --> 57:29.904
Jano, what the hell is going on?

57:29.988 --> 57:32.449
There's a man by the window.
It isn't you, right?

57:36.536 --> 57:38.371
What the fuck are you talking about?

57:40.081 --> 57:42.542
You're right. It's not in the kitchen.

57:43.168 --> 57:45.086
It's in the next room, but--

57:45.879 --> 57:47.964
Where is it, Jano? Tell me.

57:49.466 --> 57:52.719
There's nobody here.
What the hell are you talking about?

57:53.052 --> 57:54.053
Yes...

57:54.512 --> 57:56.014
Yes, it's strange.

57:56.347 --> 57:58.266
-What is it?
-I don't know...

57:59.017 --> 58:02.228
I see him and I don't at the same time.

58:06.524 --> 58:07.525
Jano?

58:08.109 --> 58:10.153
Holy shit, Jano! Are you there?

59:00.662 --> 59:01.996
I'm leaving, Rosentok.

59:05.542 --> 59:07.669
I'm out of here. I can't stand this.

59:08.002 --> 59:09.003
I had enough.

59:09.128 --> 59:10.129
There.

59:11.589 --> 59:12.590
Down there.

59:13.633 --> 59:15.843
-What happens down there?
-I found it.

59:35.113 --> 59:36.114
It's empty.

59:37.365 --> 59:38.366
Yes.

59:41.035 --> 59:42.745
But it's not empty.

59:45.456 --> 59:47.208
It's a matter of perspective.

59:47.792 --> 59:50.211
There's more than just one point of view.

1:00:15.278 --> 1:00:16.821
Darkness and light.

1:00:18.406 --> 1:00:24.162
Two different realities in the same space
and time.

1:00:24.329 --> 1:00:25.747
Darkness and light.

1:00:32.879 --> 1:00:34.964
Holy shit!
What the fuck is that, Rosentok?

1:00:35.048 --> 1:00:36.591
What the hell is that?

1:00:36.674 --> 1:00:38.384
Fucking hell! It's moving.

1:01:21.511 --> 1:01:22.512
Yes, Doctor?

1:01:23.179 --> 1:01:26.099
Mrs. Albreck, it's what I was looking for.

1:01:27.058 --> 1:01:29.769
I'm really glad to hear
that your trip was not pointless.

1:01:30.728 --> 1:01:33.648
I always thought this was connected
to what you were looking for.

1:01:33.981 --> 1:01:34.982
Yes, it is.

1:01:35.983 --> 1:01:37.902
And now? What should we do?

1:01:38.027 --> 1:01:40.071
I have no idea, Mrs. Albreck.

1:01:40.321 --> 1:01:43.282
We should try to register
everything we can.

1:01:43.616 --> 1:01:44.617
Okay.

1:01:44.826 --> 1:01:45.827
Jano!

1:01:47.370 --> 1:01:48.371
Jano!

1:03:53.913 --> 1:03:56.999
Get me out of here!
I have glass on my eyes!

1:04:04.674 --> 1:04:06.801
Can you hear me, Mr. Carabajal?

1:04:09.387 --> 1:04:10.680
I'm Mora Albreck.

1:04:11.347 --> 1:04:12.348
Do you hear me?

1:04:14.600 --> 1:04:15.601
Dr. Albreck,

1:04:17.353 --> 1:04:18.604
it's my friend, Jano.

1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:20.481
He's not well.

1:04:22.692 --> 1:04:24.944
-He needs help.
-Are you feeling okay?

1:04:25.278 --> 1:04:26.279
No, I'm not.

1:04:26.362 --> 1:04:29.740
Calm down. And don't you trust
everything you see tonight.

1:04:30.575 --> 1:04:32.535
He was inside a cupboard, knocking at it.

1:04:32.910 --> 1:04:34.161
He wanted me to help him.

1:04:34.245 --> 1:04:37.331
I broke the cupboard to get him out,
but I couldn't.

1:04:37.540 --> 1:04:38.958
-I couldn't.
-I'll say it again.

1:04:39.041 --> 1:04:41.502
Tonight, you may see things
that are not real.

1:04:41.961 --> 1:04:45.047
This blood is not mine.

1:04:45.548 --> 1:04:47.550
I didn't injure myself.

1:04:47.633 --> 1:04:49.886
This blood belongs to my friend Jano.

1:04:50.344 --> 1:04:53.973
And there's some blood
that belongs to Rosentok.

1:04:54.056 --> 1:04:55.933
Isn't this blood real?

1:04:56.142 --> 1:04:57.727
Wash your hands.

1:04:57.810 --> 1:04:58.811
Come on, do it!

1:04:59.228 --> 1:05:02.106
You mustn't have blood on your hands,
not here.

1:05:06.652 --> 1:05:08.237
These beings like blood.

1:05:10.448 --> 1:05:12.617
Have you used running water tonight?

1:05:17.747 --> 1:05:18.789
I must go.

1:05:20.458 --> 1:05:21.918
I must get out of here.

1:05:23.377 --> 1:05:24.420
Dr. Rosentok?

1:05:25.171 --> 1:05:26.213
Are you there?

1:05:27.882 --> 1:05:30.551
We have to abandon the investigation.

1:05:31.802 --> 1:05:33.179
Do you hear me, Doctor?

1:05:33.804 --> 1:05:35.598
We are too exposed.

1:05:36.390 --> 1:05:38.059
There must be an explanation.

1:05:38.935 --> 1:05:39.977
Something.

1:05:40.645 --> 1:05:42.063
There must be something.

1:05:42.146 --> 1:05:46.317
-There's not much.
-I have to explain this to other people.

1:05:49.153 --> 1:05:50.196
There's a theory.

1:05:51.614 --> 1:05:52.990
I'll understand it, I promise.

1:05:53.115 --> 1:05:57.828
We study dimensional planes
that coexist in balance

1:05:57.912 --> 1:06:00.247
and are organized like orange segments.

1:06:00.831 --> 1:06:02.667
There's life in the two planes.

1:06:03.042 --> 1:06:06.963
Water allows carrying microscopic life

1:06:07.046 --> 1:06:10.675
and this life may gather,
nest or reproduce.

1:06:12.677 --> 1:06:14.136
It can use our bodies.

1:06:16.847 --> 1:06:19.809
I don't have any idea
what kind of beings they are.

1:06:21.727 --> 1:06:26.357
-Nor why the attack us.
-Is there a way to stop this?

1:06:27.066 --> 1:06:28.109
What?

1:06:28.192 --> 1:06:29.944
All of this you're saying.

1:06:32.279 --> 1:06:33.114
No.

1:11:47.219 --> 1:11:48.595
I had a heart attack.

1:11:50.973 --> 1:11:51.932
I'm not sure.

1:11:53.642 --> 1:11:54.768
Please, help me.

1:11:57.229 --> 1:11:58.480
We can't stay here.

1:12:00.232 --> 1:12:02.234
Get me out of here now.

1:12:02.818 --> 1:12:04.820
You made me look like I was crazy.

1:12:07.448 --> 1:12:10.284
You made me think
that it had been all a fantasy.

1:12:12.036 --> 1:12:13.412
You took my baby.

1:12:15.497 --> 1:12:16.540
And they saw you.

1:12:17.875 --> 1:12:18.834
I saw you.

1:12:19.793 --> 1:12:21.045
I watched the videos.

1:12:22.338 --> 1:12:23.672
I saw you hiding him.

1:12:26.133 --> 1:12:28.135
You tried to hide my baby.

1:12:28.886 --> 1:12:30.679
You wanted to hide him, right?

1:12:31.305 --> 1:12:33.974
Why did you put
concrete over his grave?

1:12:34.725 --> 1:12:36.727
Answer me. Why did you do that?

1:12:37.978 --> 1:12:40.814
I did it for you. I swear it.

1:12:42.149 --> 1:12:43.525
I wanted to explain it.

1:12:46.153 --> 1:12:47.905
To explain it to you.

1:12:49.239 --> 1:12:50.699
Take me to the hospital.

1:12:51.075 --> 1:12:53.202
Take me, please. Get me out of here.

1:13:08.926 --> 1:13:09.885
Get in.

1:13:18.310 --> 1:13:19.895
I wasn't going to leave him there.

1:13:21.188 --> 1:13:23.399
I couldn't leave my baby in the cemetery.

1:13:30.197 --> 1:13:31.532
I could not leave him!

1:13:47.131 --> 1:13:48.340
You still have time!

1:13:51.677 --> 1:13:53.595
They are torturing us all!

1:13:54.721 --> 1:13:55.681
Funes!

1:15:31.568 --> 1:15:32.528
I hear you.

1:15:34.363 --> 1:15:36.365
Captain Funes, are you there?

1:15:37.157 --> 1:15:40.994
I've been calling you for hours.
The police station is a mess.

1:15:41.912 --> 1:15:44.248
The woman came over, your friend.

1:15:44.665 --> 1:15:47.417
The child's mother.
She was looking for you desperately.

1:15:47.501 --> 1:15:50.128
I didn't have an alternative.
I told her where you were.

1:15:50.212 --> 1:15:51.547
She was going to meet you.

1:15:52.589 --> 1:15:54.633
I did everything I could to stop her.

1:15:55.676 --> 1:15:57.344
You weren't answering the phone.

1:15:59.054 --> 1:16:03.016
Captain Funes, the mayor was here.
You've put my career at risk.

1:16:05.102 --> 1:16:06.478
Do you hear me?

1:16:08.647 --> 1:16:11.316
I am in the neighborhood.
I'm looking for you.

1:16:11.817 --> 1:16:13.026
Your van's not here.

1:16:20.534 --> 1:16:22.869
Enrique, do you hear me?

1:16:26.498 --> 1:16:28.000
Listen to me carefully.

1:16:28.709 --> 1:16:30.460
Get out of that place.

1:16:30.544 --> 1:16:33.463
Get out of there now, it's an order.

1:16:40.095 --> 1:16:42.097
Holy shit, Enrique!

1:16:42.180 --> 1:16:45.100
It's an order. Get out of that place now.

1:16:45.684 --> 1:16:49.313
Tell me you're listening to me, damn it!

1:16:50.272 --> 1:16:53.275
I copy you, Captain.
I'm in front of Alicia's house.

1:16:53.358 --> 1:16:54.818
I don't see your van.

1:16:55.235 --> 1:16:56.820
Your friend Jano is here.

1:16:57.821 --> 1:17:01.033
I can't see very well.
He's standing in front of the house.

1:17:01.158 --> 1:17:02.200
He's being weird.

1:17:02.451 --> 1:17:03.702
-Very weird.
-Enrique.

1:17:03.785 --> 1:17:08.582
Get away from that place now.
It's an order. Did you get that?

1:17:13.003 --> 1:17:15.005
Roger that. I'm leaving.

1:18:25.075 --> 1:18:26.034
Alicia!

1:18:26.743 --> 1:18:28.620
We have to go, Alicia!

1:21:24.254 --> 1:21:25.213
Mr. Blumetti.

1:21:25.714 --> 1:21:30.510
This is Dr. Razoni
and this is officer Guzmán.

1:21:31.761 --> 1:21:36.725
I want you to know that this is
being recorded with your consent.

1:21:36.808 --> 1:21:40.478
And the testimony of the parties
will not have evidentiary value.

1:21:41.354 --> 1:21:43.356
On October 3rd...

1:21:43.899 --> 1:21:48.486
of this year at 6:40 p.m.

1:21:51.531 --> 1:21:52.490
Mr. Blumetti,

1:21:53.742 --> 1:21:59.247
do you recognize these people
who visited you a year ago?

1:22:01.583 --> 1:22:04.544
-Yes.
-Do you remember their names?

1:22:05.629 --> 1:22:09.174
But you remember them talking to you.
What did they tell you?

1:22:10.050 --> 1:22:11.009
Yes.

1:22:12.886 --> 1:22:14.888
They came here to help me...

1:22:15.805 --> 1:22:17.474
because they had evidence...

1:22:19.267 --> 1:22:20.894
of my wife's disappearance.

1:22:22.854 --> 1:22:23.813
What else?

1:22:24.898 --> 1:22:26.566
They made me sign documents.

1:22:26.650 --> 1:22:28.485
Yes, some authorizations.

1:22:28.568 --> 1:22:29.736
What else?

1:22:30.153 --> 1:22:31.196
I don't remember.

1:22:31.988 --> 1:22:34.115
I was very medicated at that time.

1:22:34.741 --> 1:22:36.826
Do you know inspector Funes?

1:22:40.205 --> 1:22:41.164
Yes, I do.

1:22:42.499 --> 1:22:44.125
Yes, he's a police officer.

1:22:44.709 --> 1:22:48.546
He had a relationship with
my neighbor, Alicia.

1:22:48.880 --> 1:22:50.298
Alicia Pérez?

1:22:50.715 --> 1:22:51.675
Okay.

1:22:52.467 --> 1:22:54.469
When did you last see Funes?

1:22:55.762 --> 1:23:00.016
I saw him the day of
Alicia's son's burial.

1:23:00.892 --> 1:23:06.272
Is there anything else about Funes
that you consider pertinent?

1:23:11.653 --> 1:23:17.117
He told me he was about to retire
and that he had some health issues.

1:23:18.660 --> 1:23:20.412
And that's it.

1:23:21.913 --> 1:23:27.877
Officer Guzmán is collaborating with us
and he witnessed how Funes

1:23:28.003 --> 1:23:31.089
set your house on fire,
with people on the inside.

1:23:32.298 --> 1:23:34.342
Inspector Funes is a fugitive

1:23:34.426 --> 1:23:39.055
and we believe he may be connected
to your wife's case.

1:23:49.691 --> 1:23:51.693
Let's go back to your wife's case.

1:23:51.776 --> 1:23:56.865
It was stated that the officers found
fingerprints with your wife's blood

1:23:56.948 --> 1:24:00.160
not only on the bathroom,
but also all over your house.

1:24:02.037 --> 1:24:04.289
-This muddles the investigation--
-Him.

1:24:05.623 --> 1:24:06.916
Did he come with you?

1:24:12.255 --> 1:24:13.214
Who?

1:24:13.923 --> 1:24:14.883
Blumetti...

1:24:15.675 --> 1:24:20.555
we're investigating unconventional things
from the system's point of view.

1:24:24.976 --> 1:24:25.935
It's him.

1:24:26.478 --> 1:24:27.437
Rosentok.

1:24:28.063 --> 1:24:29.022
Yes.

1:24:29.397 --> 1:24:31.608
It's not the same. His face is burnt.

1:24:33.777 --> 1:24:34.736
It's him.

1:24:40.241 --> 1:24:41.242
He came with you.

1:24:43.328 --> 1:24:44.287
Yes.

1:24:45.747 --> 1:24:46.748
He came with you.

1:27:22.779 --> 1:27:25.240
