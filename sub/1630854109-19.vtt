WEBVTT

00:12.210 --> 00:13.490
Base, this is Uchida.

00:13.690 --> 00:15.230
Approximately 300 meters out.

00:15.430 --> 00:18.400
Collecting samples,
and then I'm RTB.

00:18.600 --> 00:21.100
WATKINS:
Copy. Make 'em good this time.

00:21.300 --> 00:22.970
Negative, Habitat.

00:23.170 --> 00:25.740
I'm gonna make sure they're the
best samples you've ever seen.

00:25.940 --> 00:27.340
(static)

00:27.540 --> 00:30.840
Can't even get a "copy"
on the attempt at a joke.

00:31.040 --> 00:32.660
(grunts softly)

00:33.500 --> 00:35.550
WATKINS:
Graham? Graham, what's wrong?

00:35.750 --> 00:38.150
Uchida,
there's an urgent situation.

00:38.350 --> 00:40.120
Return to base now!

00:40.320 --> 00:42.470
(panting)

00:43.340 --> 00:45.160
GRAHAM:
<i>You're not listening.</i>

00:45.360 --> 00:47.290
Graham, just talk to me.

00:47.490 --> 00:48.830
(panting):
We...

00:49.030 --> 00:51.710
We need to get out of here.
And go where?

00:53.720 --> 00:54.600
Home.

00:54.800 --> 00:55.870
You know we can't do that.

00:56.070 --> 00:57.990
(door opens, air hisses)

01:00.320 --> 01:01.210
Graham, what's wrong?

01:01.410 --> 01:02.860
We're all going to die in here.

01:04.030 --> 01:05.540
Graham!

01:05.740 --> 01:08.250
Oh, my God.
We need to call for help!

01:08.450 --> 01:10.180
He's not breathing.
Starting CPR.

01:10.380 --> 01:12.650
Habitat to Mission Control.

01:12.850 --> 01:14.290
It appears Commander Graham
is in cardiac arrest.

01:14.490 --> 01:16.890
How should we proceed?
Tell 'em to call 911!

01:17.090 --> 01:19.230
UCHIDA:
Come on, Graham! Come on!

01:19.430 --> 01:20.560
Stay with us.

01:20.760 --> 01:23.480
<i>Come on, Graham. Graham.</i>

01:28.520 --> 01:30.750
* *

01:40.630 --> 01:41.810
Did I hear you right
on the phone

01:42.010 --> 01:43.620
that there was
a death on Mars,

01:43.820 --> 01:45.220
or is that a product
of my lack of caffeine?

01:45.420 --> 01:47.320
Thank you.
NASA's Mars simulation

01:47.520 --> 01:49.660
on Navy land here on Oahu.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.960
I mean, it's like we're
living in science fiction.

01:52.160 --> 01:53.760
Except no Matt Damon.

01:53.960 --> 01:57.060
Just, uh, Lieutenant Commander
Darren Graham.

01:57.260 --> 01:59.330
All the right stuff.
Flew Super Hornets

01:59.530 --> 02:01.170
before transitioning
to space shuttles.

02:01.370 --> 02:02.640
Well, do we know how he died?

02:02.840 --> 02:04.170
Officials involved
in the simulation

02:04.370 --> 02:05.670
are calling it "an acute

02:05.870 --> 02:07.510
medical event."
JESSE:
I'm just gonna say it.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.310
"Government coverup"
is the last square

02:09.510 --> 02:11.010
on the sci-fi bingo card.

02:11.210 --> 02:13.080
They still may be trying
to find out what happened.

02:13.280 --> 02:16.650
Now, why are they out there
playing pretend Mars anyway?

02:16.850 --> 02:18.250
ERNIE: The volcanoes
on Hawai'i have

02:18.450 --> 02:19.690
the same basaltic composition

02:19.890 --> 02:21.550
as those on Mars, making it

02:21.750 --> 02:25.320
a great testing site for NASA
to understand and counter

02:25.520 --> 02:27.060
the physical
and mental challenges

02:27.260 --> 02:30.000
the astronauts will face
on the Red Planet.
KAI: Wow.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.230
I was gonna say,
'cause certain parts just...

02:31.430 --> 02:32.870
they look like Mars,

02:33.070 --> 02:35.070
but your answer is, like,
way more informed.

02:35.270 --> 02:37.270
Well, going to Mars has sort of
been a dream of mine.

02:37.470 --> 02:40.470
Actually, advancing humanity
is the dream.

02:40.670 --> 02:43.080
Space exploration felt
like a good way to do it.

02:43.280 --> 02:45.880
Oh. That's so much more mature
than my childhood dream.

02:46.080 --> 02:47.110
JESSE:
Oh, yeah?

02:47.310 --> 02:50.870
What was that?
To own the Dallas Cowboys.

02:51.900 --> 02:53.290
(quiet laughter)
That's cool.

02:53.490 --> 02:54.720
Well, it was
Graham's dream

02:54.920 --> 02:56.460
to go on this mission,
and he wound up dead.

02:56.660 --> 02:57.790
So we need to figure out why.

02:57.990 --> 02:59.760
Simulations like this
are planned down

02:59.960 --> 03:01.430
to every second, every bolt.

03:01.630 --> 03:03.200
Every dead body?

03:03.400 --> 03:04.860
Yes, actually.

03:05.060 --> 03:06.270
I mean, point is,

03:06.470 --> 03:09.600
access is going
to be a problem, even for you.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.990
Guess we'll have to
ask nicely, then.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.380
(indistinct radio transmission)

03:21.580 --> 03:24.050
This area is restricted.

03:24.250 --> 03:25.720
Special Agent
in Charge Tennant.

03:25.920 --> 03:28.050
This is Special Agent
Holman. NCIS.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.520
Colonel Tannon McCarthy,
Space Force.

03:30.720 --> 03:33.260
I'm overseeing NASA's
joint operations

03:33.460 --> 03:34.330
here

03:34.530 --> 03:36.040
on island. Is there a problem?

03:37.050 --> 03:38.510
I'm sorry.

03:39.210 --> 03:42.000
I... I've never seen
a Space Force

03:42.200 --> 03:44.600
uniform in...
in person before.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.410
I like the buttons.

03:47.610 --> 03:48.570
TENNANT: The problem
is, we need to get in

03:48.770 --> 03:49.740
to process the scene.

03:49.940 --> 03:51.840
This is
a highly-sensitive mission.

03:52.040 --> 03:53.650
I've already left word
with Director Vance.

03:53.850 --> 03:55.980
Went straight to the top.

03:56.180 --> 03:58.680
The only people who can go up
there are those with clearances.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.320
Oh, we-we <i>have</i> clearances.

04:00.520 --> 04:03.290
And who have been read in
to our special access programs.

04:03.490 --> 04:04.860
Past this gate is
a $50 million

04:05.060 --> 04:06.690
mission-in-progress
with state-of-the-art tech

04:06.890 --> 04:08.330
that only a couple
of dozen people

04:08.530 --> 04:09.800
on Earth have seen in person.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.120
I think a dead Navy pilot
trumps your sunk costs.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.970
This mission only works
if we exist

04:16.170 --> 04:19.740
as if those astronauts
on that hill are really on Mars.

04:19.940 --> 04:21.640
Are you saying
we can't even go up there

04:21.840 --> 04:23.440
and extract
Commander Graham's body?

04:23.640 --> 04:25.480
We're handling the body and
the situation per guidelines,

04:25.680 --> 04:28.960
as if they were really on Mars.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.450
How did Commander Graham die?

04:32.650 --> 04:33.820
We think maybe
by natural causes.

04:34.020 --> 04:35.090
So you're saying it's illness?

04:35.290 --> 04:36.620
It's too early
to say definitively.

04:36.820 --> 04:38.890
In which case,
it could be accidental,

04:39.090 --> 04:41.430
maybe even the result
of foul play.

04:41.630 --> 04:42.800
Foul play?
Look, if you don't know

04:43.000 --> 04:44.800
his cause of death
and can't rule those out,

04:45.000 --> 04:46.300
then that scene
and that evidence

04:46.500 --> 04:48.330
need to be preserved
for proper investigation.

04:48.530 --> 04:49.870
Is there anyone

04:50.070 --> 04:52.140
on your team capable
of processing the crime scene

04:52.340 --> 04:55.820
per guidelines, as though
we were really on Earth?

04:56.660 --> 04:58.540
What kind of procedures?

04:58.740 --> 05:00.630
I think that's a no.

05:02.230 --> 05:04.220
Come with me.

05:04.420 --> 05:06.070
This way.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.560
This is all I can
authorize at this time.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.030
We record all
transmissions,

05:14.230 --> 05:15.930
we have monitors set up
for observations.

05:16.130 --> 05:17.830
We keep detailed records
of all health indicators.

05:18.030 --> 05:20.570
You want answers,
they're here.

05:20.770 --> 05:22.670
All right, take statements
and head back to Pearl.

05:22.870 --> 05:24.440
Check in with the rest
of the team.

05:24.640 --> 05:25.970
What about forensics?

05:26.170 --> 05:27.340
Working on it.

05:27.540 --> 05:28.790
Right.

05:30.360 --> 05:31.740
Were you recording
Commander Graham's vitals

05:31.940 --> 05:33.150
at the time of his death?

05:33.350 --> 05:35.050
We know he had
a massive cardiac event.

05:35.250 --> 05:37.700
His heart rate spiked
to over 200 beats per minute.

05:38.570 --> 05:39.690
Any prior medical history?

05:39.890 --> 05:41.120
Commander Graham had
a clean bill of health

05:41.320 --> 05:42.360
during his evaluation,

05:42.560 --> 05:44.390
as did
all of the astronauts.

05:44.590 --> 05:46.260
So, in other words,

05:46.460 --> 05:49.360
a perfectly healthy Navy pilot
had a cardiac event

05:49.560 --> 05:52.920
and died... for no reason.

05:54.780 --> 05:57.390
Do you have video footage
of the event?

05:59.320 --> 06:01.890
Go ahead.

06:02.690 --> 06:04.840
Hey, hey, Graham, what's wrong?
(panting)

06:05.040 --> 06:06.240
He was trying to get out.
We're all gonna die in here.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.010
The rest of the crew
wouldn't let him.

06:08.210 --> 06:10.780
It sounds like he's suffering
from extreme anxiety.

06:10.980 --> 06:12.390
Cabin fever? No way.

06:12.590 --> 06:14.550
These astronauts go through
serious psych evaluation.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.050
Okay, well,
something anomalous happened

06:16.250 --> 06:18.920
that your background checks
didn't predict.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.690
The longer we wait,
the less time we have

06:20.890 --> 06:22.560
to find out what it was.

06:22.760 --> 06:23.960
Better to figure out
what happened in Hawai'i

06:24.160 --> 06:25.960
than hope it doesn't
happen again on Mars.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.100
Right?

06:27.300 --> 06:28.330
UCHIDA:
Come on, stay with us.

06:28.530 --> 06:30.670
LUCY:
<i>You got to be kidding me.</i>

06:30.870 --> 06:33.210
Every one of these astronauts
is an immigrant parent's dream.

06:33.410 --> 06:35.810
Seriously, my parents
would love this guy:

06:36.010 --> 06:37.840
dual master's degree

06:38.040 --> 06:39.980
in economics
and electrical engineering.

06:40.180 --> 06:41.710
If it says he plays the piano...

06:41.910 --> 06:43.620
Yup, there you go.
Concert pianist.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.080
They are exceptional.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.090
Surprised you didn't apply.
Please.

06:47.290 --> 06:49.960
Each of these astronauts have
made an incredible contribution

06:50.160 --> 06:51.690
to science and mankind,

06:51.890 --> 06:53.330
including Commander Graham.

06:53.530 --> 06:56.090
Defies logic, doesn't it?
Completely healthy guy,

06:56.290 --> 06:59.500
living his best life,
panics and drops dead.

06:59.700 --> 07:00.630
I'm not a conspiracy theorist...

07:00.830 --> 07:02.130
But here comes one anyway.

07:02.330 --> 07:04.770
Would another country try
to sabotage the simulation?

07:04.970 --> 07:06.570
Oh, totally.
So it's not far-fetched?

07:06.770 --> 07:07.610
No, it is.

07:07.810 --> 07:08.870
These projects are

07:09.070 --> 07:10.740
heavily guarded
against espionage.

07:10.940 --> 07:12.450
You know that
from your NSA days?

07:12.650 --> 07:15.680
We had counterintelligence ops
running at holiday picnics.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.320
(door opens)

07:17.520 --> 07:18.550
I have some good news.

07:18.750 --> 07:20.520
How did the FBI get roped
into this?

07:20.720 --> 07:24.360
We didn't. Lucy asked
if I know anybody at NASA,

07:24.560 --> 07:26.290
and... well, I do.

07:26.490 --> 07:29.190
That's my girlfriend.

07:29.390 --> 07:30.130
ERNIE:
I think what

07:30.330 --> 07:31.630
heart-eyes over here meant

07:31.830 --> 07:33.830
to say is, "Any breakthroughs?"

07:34.030 --> 07:36.230
Not a breakthrough, per se, but

07:36.430 --> 07:38.300
a break in red tape.
I think I found

07:38.500 --> 07:40.840
a loophole that would
let an investigator inside.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.310
That's amazing. How?
Well, turns out,

07:43.510 --> 07:45.640
one of us applied
to the Mission to Mars program

07:45.840 --> 07:47.050
years ago and is eligible
to be read in

07:47.250 --> 07:49.150
and admitted into the habitat.

07:49.350 --> 07:51.030
One of us?

07:53.370 --> 07:54.650
You <i>did</i> apply.

07:54.850 --> 07:57.390
But I didn't get in.
I didn't think it mattered.

07:57.590 --> 08:00.210
Well, here's your chance
to be an astronaut.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.000
McCARTHY:
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

08:04.200 --> 08:05.460
You said only
authorized personnel

08:05.660 --> 08:07.270
with proper credentials
could set foot inside.

08:07.470 --> 08:08.600
This is highly unusual.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.070
But not unplanned for.

08:11.270 --> 08:13.310
A part of the simulation
will involve direct handovers,

08:13.510 --> 08:14.940
won't it?

08:15.140 --> 08:18.640
There you go-- direct handovers.
You don't know what that is.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.850
I don't have to. He does.

08:21.050 --> 08:23.150
ERNIE:
New personnel
replace old ones.

08:23.350 --> 08:26.080
Me showing up to the habitat
isn't much different.

08:26.280 --> 08:27.690
Except it's not part
of the plan.

08:27.890 --> 08:30.410
One of your crew members
dying wasn't either.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.630
If you were meant
to be in the habitat,

08:34.830 --> 08:37.600
you'd already be in there.

08:37.800 --> 08:39.630
I know I didn't make the cut,

08:39.830 --> 08:42.740
but the last thing I want to do
is interfere with something

08:42.940 --> 08:45.250
I would have killed
to be a part of.

08:46.290 --> 08:48.520
Sorry. Bad choice of word.

08:53.260 --> 08:55.350
They're actually letting you in!

08:55.550 --> 08:57.620
Well, "actually" is doing
a lot of heavy lifting.

08:57.820 --> 08:59.620
(beeping)

08:59.820 --> 09:01.050
Sorry. I...

09:01.250 --> 09:03.420
I mean it in a good way.

09:03.620 --> 09:04.960
We need someone inside,

09:05.160 --> 09:07.930
and who better than the guy
who can do anything?

09:08.130 --> 09:10.130
Thanks, Luce.
Hey, do me a favor?

09:10.330 --> 09:12.030
What's this?
My mom got it for me
when I was a kid.

09:12.230 --> 09:13.270
They won't let me bring it,

09:13.470 --> 09:16.150
so maybe
you can hold onto it for me?

09:16.950 --> 09:19.340
You're taking the rules
very seriously.

09:19.540 --> 09:21.410
It's a serious operation
up there.

09:21.610 --> 09:23.910
But I think I'm ready.

09:24.110 --> 09:27.880
iPad for capturing data.

09:28.080 --> 09:28.980
Portable oxygen.

09:29.180 --> 09:30.820
Hopefully won't need that.

09:31.020 --> 09:32.890
Pencils?

09:33.090 --> 09:35.020
All else fails,
old tech is still tech.

09:35.220 --> 09:38.410
Good to know
you're prepared for Mars.

09:39.240 --> 09:41.090
Doing okay, though?

09:41.290 --> 09:43.900
Yeah, why not? I'm finally
going to this place

09:44.100 --> 09:45.900
I've only ever been able
to imagine myself in.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.900
But to investigate
a mysterious death,

09:48.100 --> 09:50.200
not exactly how you pictured it?

09:50.400 --> 09:52.240
You got any pointers?
Oh, yeah, sure. Let's see.

09:52.440 --> 09:56.110
Uh, step one is
the arrival, assessment,

09:56.310 --> 09:57.740
prioritization of effort.

09:57.940 --> 09:59.580
You want to minimize
contamination while

09:59.780 --> 10:01.050
protecting the scene, and then

10:01.250 --> 10:02.480
there are subordinate steps
on how to do that,

10:02.680 --> 10:04.780
depending on what kind
of evidence you find...

10:04.980 --> 10:06.320
I'm sorry. How-how many steps--

10:06.520 --> 10:08.750
subordinate or otherwise--
are there?

10:08.950 --> 10:10.790
A lot, but, you know,

10:10.990 --> 10:12.320
forget all that.

10:12.520 --> 10:15.210
Here's the one thing
that you need to know.

10:16.910 --> 10:20.220
Just be you,
'cause you're enough.

10:26.190 --> 10:28.040
TENNANT:
How you feeling, Ernie?

10:28.240 --> 10:31.330
Exhilarated and uncoordinated.

10:45.110 --> 10:47.180
(air hisses)

10:57.220 --> 10:59.170
(groans)

10:59.370 --> 11:01.560
(air hisses)

11:02.990 --> 11:04.940
Colonel Watkins,
Commander of HI-MES.

11:05.140 --> 11:07.850
Hey. Hi. Uh, uh,
can you help me with this?

11:08.050 --> 11:10.150
Yeah, let me help you.
Uh, these things are tricky

11:10.350 --> 11:12.150
at first.

11:12.350 --> 11:13.490
Thanks.

11:13.690 --> 11:15.670
Welcome to the HI-MES Habitat.

11:23.580 --> 11:24.900
(door closes)

11:25.100 --> 11:26.530
WATKINS:
Let me introduce you
to the team.

11:26.730 --> 11:29.940
Lending you a hand--
our bio researcher

11:30.140 --> 11:31.570
and designated medical officer
Dr. Lara...

11:31.770 --> 11:34.740
Lara Uchida.
I'm Ernie Malik.

11:34.940 --> 11:38.380
I am a big fan. Sorry,
that must seem weird.

11:38.580 --> 11:39.710
It's just that your work

11:39.910 --> 11:41.880
culturing microbes
have led researchers

11:42.080 --> 11:43.520
to boldly grow

11:43.720 --> 11:45.150
where no man has grown before.

11:45.350 --> 11:46.990
Just like Dr. Hampton's
micro-reactors

11:47.190 --> 11:48.520
are paving the way

11:48.720 --> 11:50.770
for renewables.

11:53.780 --> 11:56.430
I'm sorry for your loss.

11:56.630 --> 11:58.430
I'll be out of here
as soon as I can.

11:58.630 --> 11:59.830
We're glad you're here.

12:00.030 --> 12:01.400
No, not all of us.
WATKINS:
Major Thomas Mullen.

12:01.600 --> 12:05.200
You do realize, one mistake,
and you'll ruin the simulation?

12:05.400 --> 12:09.060
You have a very intense way
of saying hello.

12:10.260 --> 12:12.860
I'll take you
to Commander Graham.

12:13.660 --> 12:15.700
Okay.

12:21.700 --> 12:24.090
Mixed reception.

12:24.290 --> 12:26.170
You expected different?

12:26.940 --> 12:28.330
I expected everyone
to want to know

12:28.530 --> 12:30.500
why one of their fellow
crew members is dead.

12:30.700 --> 12:31.830
What would you do
if your life's work

12:32.030 --> 12:33.470
was coming apart
at the seams?

12:33.670 --> 12:35.970
Well, some value life
over a calling.

12:36.170 --> 12:39.960
And to some,
a calling <i>is</i> their life.

12:45.230 --> 12:47.110
ERNIE:
<i>I know this must be hard</i>

12:47.310 --> 12:49.510
for all of you, but I do need
to ask some questions.

12:49.710 --> 12:51.320
Of course.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.420
Did you notice anything
different about Graham lately?

12:54.620 --> 12:56.220
Physically? Nothing except

12:56.420 --> 12:58.190
a slightly-elevated
body temperature this morning.

12:58.390 --> 12:59.590
Is that unusual?

12:59.790 --> 13:01.290
We've all had
slightly-elevated temps of late

13:01.490 --> 13:02.630
and have been fine.

13:02.830 --> 13:05.300
(beep)
Okay.

13:05.500 --> 13:07.680
What about...

13:08.680 --> 13:10.750
...I don't know, emotionally?

13:11.550 --> 13:15.040
He hadn't exactly been himself
the last couple of days.

13:15.240 --> 13:18.040
Talked about
abandoning the mission,

13:18.240 --> 13:19.380
wanting to leave.

13:19.580 --> 13:20.880
Could he have been homesick?

13:21.080 --> 13:23.650
We're all homesick,
but it's only three months.

13:23.850 --> 13:27.240
But Graham
still panicked.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.420
Unlike anything
I've ever seen before.

13:30.620 --> 13:32.460
And minutes later,

13:32.660 --> 13:34.980
he was gone.

13:36.910 --> 13:38.760
You weren't able
to identify cause of death?

13:38.960 --> 13:41.970
I-I went to med school,
but I do research.

13:42.170 --> 13:45.140
I never practiced.
You need your ankle wrapped,

13:45.340 --> 13:46.040
I'm your person.

13:46.240 --> 13:49.290
Autopsies, not so much.

13:50.060 --> 13:51.740
Are you a medical examiner?

13:51.940 --> 13:55.160
No. Computer specialist,
actually.

13:55.960 --> 13:59.200
But one of my best friends is.

14:02.500 --> 14:03.820
(mouthing)
(sighs)

14:04.020 --> 14:05.960
I've gone through all
of Graham's psych evals.

14:06.160 --> 14:07.930
Mm-hmm.
And cabin fever
isn't tracking.

14:08.130 --> 14:09.460
I didn't think so.
I mean,

14:09.660 --> 14:12.530
cockpits are much more
claustrophobic than a dome.

14:12.730 --> 14:15.320
So much sky,
such a tiny little compartment.

14:16.780 --> 14:18.700
I-I got you a surfboard

14:18.900 --> 14:20.410
for us to take out
together this weekend.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.570
Sounds fun.
Lucy?

14:22.770 --> 14:26.290
Hmm?
You just committed to surfing
with me this weekend.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.480
I did?

14:28.680 --> 14:29.950
(gasps)
I did.

14:30.150 --> 14:31.980
(laughing):
What... what is going on
with you?

14:32.180 --> 14:34.620
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm just... I'm
in the middle of reading about

14:34.820 --> 14:37.090
neurohumoral stress
response systems.

14:37.290 --> 14:38.520
Why?
Because

14:38.720 --> 14:40.430
Ernie is the lone
NCIS investigator

14:40.630 --> 14:42.290
in a self-contained habitat.

14:42.490 --> 14:43.630
He could use
some help.

14:43.830 --> 14:45.360
Okay, but...

14:45.560 --> 14:48.200
maybe leave neurohumoral
stress response systems

14:48.400 --> 14:49.630
to other people.

14:49.830 --> 14:51.470
Well, I-I thought
my pronunciation was good.

14:51.670 --> 14:52.470
I have no way to know.

14:52.670 --> 14:54.440
Me either.
(laughs)

14:54.640 --> 14:55.640
And, besides,

14:55.840 --> 14:57.710
Ernie being in there--
it's like

14:57.910 --> 14:59.810
you being an agent afloat
on a carrier.

15:00.010 --> 15:02.210
A smart person being forced
to figure things out

15:02.410 --> 15:03.550
in a foreign environment.

15:03.750 --> 15:04.920
Yeah.

15:05.120 --> 15:08.150
Imagine if you could
spend the day

15:08.350 --> 15:11.290
in the front office
at Cowboy Stadium.

15:11.490 --> 15:14.710
Find a new wide receiver three
to help move the chains.

15:15.510 --> 15:18.560
Oh, save the dirty talk
for home, will you?

15:18.760 --> 15:22.130
(both laugh)

15:22.330 --> 15:25.400
Hey, what, um...
what was your dream, anyway?

15:25.600 --> 15:27.810
Ballerina? Princess?

15:28.010 --> 15:31.580
No, a Fed, like I am now.

15:31.780 --> 15:33.450
Most kids want
something crazy,

15:33.650 --> 15:35.280
like movie star or Olympian.

15:35.480 --> 15:37.380
You wanted to solve crime
from a corner office?

15:37.580 --> 15:39.480
Mm-hmm.

15:39.680 --> 15:42.590
You know me-- the pragmatist.

15:42.790 --> 15:44.120
(phone buzzes)

15:44.320 --> 15:47.460
Oh. Chase is about
to go live with Ernie.

15:47.660 --> 15:49.810
You're not off the hook, though.

15:54.280 --> 15:55.970
Hey, how is he?

15:56.170 --> 15:57.500
Oh, we're centering him first.

15:57.700 --> 15:58.940
Oh, like meditating

15:59.140 --> 16:00.710
to get in the zone?
ERNIE:
No.

16:00.910 --> 16:02.670
Literally getting
the camera adjusted.

16:02.870 --> 16:04.190
All right.

16:06.330 --> 16:08.080
Though I could probably use
the good vibes,

16:08.280 --> 16:10.520
given I've never done
one of these alone.

16:10.720 --> 16:11.850
But you're not alone.

16:12.050 --> 16:13.320
Deep breath, Ernie,
and on the exhale,

16:13.520 --> 16:15.950
invoke Ganesha
to help remove the obstacles

16:16.150 --> 16:18.120
within yourself. (inhales)

16:18.320 --> 16:20.530
(exhales)

16:20.730 --> 16:22.060
Thanks, CC.

16:22.260 --> 16:24.210
Okay, first
you need to inspect the body.

16:25.950 --> 16:28.400
Look for visible wounds,
bruises.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.440
Uh...

16:30.640 --> 16:31.840
nothing I can see.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.010
Okay, check for Mees' lines:

16:34.210 --> 16:35.810
white lines or bands
on the fingernails.

16:36.010 --> 16:37.180
Usually good indicators

16:37.380 --> 16:39.340
of preexisting
health complications.

16:39.540 --> 16:40.680
Nope.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.780
Now his eyes.

16:42.980 --> 16:45.620
This seems... wrong.

16:45.820 --> 16:49.720
You're honoring him by finding
out how he left this world.

16:49.920 --> 16:51.310
He won't mind.

16:52.310 --> 16:54.180
All right.

16:58.050 --> 16:59.530
His pupils are constricted.

16:59.730 --> 17:00.870
I can barely see them.

17:01.070 --> 17:02.400
LUCY:
That's not normal, is it?

17:02.600 --> 17:04.040
It's eye miosis.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.470
And what could cause that?

17:05.670 --> 17:08.570
Uh, Horner's syndrome,
uveitis, iritis maybe.

17:08.770 --> 17:09.910
Sure, but that'd be weird

17:10.110 --> 17:11.280
given his clean bill of health.

17:11.480 --> 17:12.680
LUCY:
So, if it wasn't
natural causes...

17:12.880 --> 17:14.800
May mean he was poisoned.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.720
It would explain
the increased body temperature.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.850
And the manic reaction?
Oh.

17:20.050 --> 17:21.190
Certainly,
though we'll need samples

17:21.390 --> 17:23.070
from his organs to be sure.

17:23.870 --> 17:24.990
Oh.

17:25.190 --> 17:26.260
Oh, y-you'll be fine.

17:26.460 --> 17:28.130
I'll walk you
through the process.

17:28.330 --> 17:32.080
No, I-I think he's realized
that, if that's true, then...

17:33.620 --> 17:36.350
...Graham's killer is still
in the habitat.

17:39.620 --> 17:40.910
There's no way.

17:41.110 --> 17:42.870
That habitat is the most
secure place in Hawai'i.

17:43.070 --> 17:44.210
Doesn't matter
if the person

17:44.410 --> 17:46.140
who killed
Commander Graham is inside.

17:46.340 --> 17:47.680
Why would someone do that?

17:47.880 --> 17:49.880
You're telling me there's no
friction between crew members?

17:50.080 --> 17:52.320
Friction is inevitable, murder
is something else entirely.

17:52.520 --> 17:54.790
Were there any confrontations
between Commander Graham

17:54.990 --> 17:56.450
and other crew members
before today?

17:56.650 --> 17:58.490
They wouldn't throw away
everything they've worked for

17:58.690 --> 18:00.830
over a fight about
laundry privileges.

18:01.030 --> 18:02.130
And I'm not trying
to throw away

18:02.330 --> 18:03.500
everything
you've worked for, either.

18:03.700 --> 18:06.260
But the second
that I have reasonable suspicion

18:06.460 --> 18:08.870
that there is a murder suspect
inside that habitat,

18:09.070 --> 18:11.340
I'll be going in there myself.

18:11.540 --> 18:13.660
Excuse me.

18:16.420 --> 18:17.740
Yeah, Jesse.

18:17.940 --> 18:19.310
Start pulling together profiles

18:19.510 --> 18:20.980
on all the people
working on the program.

18:21.180 --> 18:22.610
And expedite the warrant.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.920
And search Graham's home.
See if you can find any clues

18:25.120 --> 18:26.550
as to who would want him dead.

18:26.750 --> 18:29.640
Thanks.

18:39.250 --> 18:40.300
Geez.

18:40.500 --> 18:43.170
Looks like my kid
decorated the place.

18:43.370 --> 18:46.400
Yeah, Jake wants
to be the next Neil Armstrong?

18:46.600 --> 18:48.370
Something like that.

18:48.570 --> 18:50.910
Didn't get it from me.
Oh.

18:51.110 --> 18:53.480
What did little Jesse want
to be?

18:53.680 --> 18:56.710
No, no, I'm not playing
that game with you.

18:56.910 --> 18:58.420
What game?

18:58.620 --> 19:00.050
Where I answer
the question,

19:00.250 --> 19:01.550
and then you do
that Kai thing

19:01.750 --> 19:03.760
where you act all quiet
and mysterious.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.160
Come on, just try me, come on.

19:06.360 --> 19:08.190
All right, we'll say it
at the exact same together.

19:08.390 --> 19:09.730
On the count of three.

19:09.930 --> 19:11.200
All right.
One.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.800
Two, three. Cellist.
Wait. What age are we talking?

19:14.000 --> 19:17.940
Come on, man.
Sorry. No, no, I'm...
I was... I was gonna...

19:18.140 --> 19:19.740
Cellist?
Yeah.

19:19.940 --> 19:23.480
You've obviously never seen
Yo-Yo Ma perform live.

19:23.680 --> 19:26.810
He was at the Waikiki
Shell last week.

19:27.010 --> 19:28.180
That's not right.

19:28.380 --> 19:29.910
No, that's right.
I was there. I would know.

19:30.110 --> 19:31.650
No, there's a cot here.

19:31.850 --> 19:33.950
With personal effects.

19:34.150 --> 19:37.090
Huh. Graham's the only one
on the lease.

19:37.290 --> 19:40.170
Well, he's got a roommate. Who?

19:45.750 --> 19:47.600
Hey.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.450
Check this out.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.470
It's Major Mullen.

19:52.670 --> 19:54.270
Oh, yeah.

19:54.470 --> 19:57.010
They look like good pals, happy.

19:57.210 --> 20:00.350
Like they just went
to see Yo-Yo Ma.

20:00.550 --> 20:02.330
Ha, ha.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.450
Must be Mullen's iPad.

20:06.650 --> 20:08.050
Yeah, there's a bunch
of messages

20:08.250 --> 20:10.440
from friends and family.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.790
"Don't do anything
you'll regret."

20:13.990 --> 20:15.580
"They'll figure it out."

20:18.180 --> 20:20.820
How did Mission Control
not know about these?

20:21.580 --> 20:24.740
"Whatever you're thinking
of doing, don't."

20:24.940 --> 20:28.410
Was that about hurting Commander
Graham, or something else?

20:28.610 --> 20:31.210
I don't know,
but I don't think

20:31.410 --> 20:33.630
we should wait
to find out.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.630
Thank you.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.720
What do you have for me?
Major Thomas Mullen's

20:40.920 --> 20:42.920
whole life has been built
around going to space.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.290
He even named his childhood dog
Buzz Aldrin.

20:45.490 --> 20:46.590
Doesn't have his own place.

20:46.790 --> 20:47.990
No car.

20:48.190 --> 20:49.330
Has his own bank account
that he doesn't use

20:49.530 --> 20:50.760
because he's busy working
on the mission.

20:50.960 --> 20:52.200
A mission

20:52.400 --> 20:54.420
that Commander Graham's behavior
was disrupting.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.530
After all

20:56.730 --> 20:57.970
he's put into this,
you really think

20:58.170 --> 20:59.670
he'd poison Graham just
to protect the mission?

20:59.870 --> 21:01.210
WHISTLER:
It's not like

21:01.410 --> 21:03.440
murder's the best plan
if you want to keep it on rails.

21:03.640 --> 21:06.880
Maybe it is... if it looks
like a medical event.

21:07.080 --> 21:09.500
This means
we can move in, right?

21:10.300 --> 21:13.520
We need to let Ernie know
first... quietly.

21:13.720 --> 21:17.050
Whistler, mind distracting
our Space Force friend?

21:17.250 --> 21:18.690
Battle of bureaucracy.

21:18.890 --> 21:20.410
My pleasure.

21:21.940 --> 21:23.030
Let's go.

21:23.230 --> 21:25.250
(clears throat)

21:28.680 --> 21:29.700
Hey, guys.

21:29.900 --> 21:31.000
How you doing, Ernie?

21:31.200 --> 21:33.670
Ugh. Being a space cop
is hard work.

21:33.870 --> 21:36.010
Can you find somewhere private
without raising suspicion?

21:36.210 --> 21:38.130
Yeah, one sec.

21:41.230 --> 21:42.510
What-What's going on?

21:42.710 --> 21:45.280
Well, we have reason
to suspect Major Mullen.

21:45.480 --> 21:47.500
Is it weird I'm not surprised?

21:48.300 --> 21:49.990
Where is he now?

21:50.190 --> 21:51.190
I'm not sure.

21:51.390 --> 21:52.790
Other than Uchida,

21:52.990 --> 21:54.130
no one has come near the body.

21:54.330 --> 21:55.760
Okay, well, get ready
'cause we're coming in.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.530
I'll go downstairs,
let the others know,

21:57.730 --> 21:59.460
so they're prepared.
Ernie, behind you!

21:59.660 --> 22:01.350
(both grunt)

22:10.760 --> 22:12.440
Why can't we see
into the habitat?

22:12.640 --> 22:14.680
Lockdown protocol's been
initiated. Habitat's gone dark.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.010
Special Response Team

22:16.210 --> 22:17.580
is approaching
the exterior, Colonel.

22:17.780 --> 22:19.780
McCARTHY:
This is Aaron Patel,
head of security.

22:19.980 --> 22:21.490
On your signal, we'll breach.
Wait.

22:21.690 --> 22:23.760
I thought you wanted to go in.

22:23.960 --> 22:25.560
That was before
we had a hostage situation.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.830
You can trust us to neutralize
the threat and secure your man,

22:28.030 --> 22:28.930
along with everyone else
in the habitat.

22:29.130 --> 22:30.730
Do you have eyes inside?

22:30.930 --> 22:33.160
No, ma'am, but we have...
Then how will you know

22:33.360 --> 22:36.850
that Major Mullen won't hurt
anyone as we breach, or worse?

22:37.850 --> 22:40.770
Look, as much as going in was
the answer five minutes ago,

22:40.970 --> 22:43.410
if we want to protect the people
inside, we can't.

22:43.610 --> 22:44.540
She's right.
Colonel...

22:44.740 --> 22:45.930
Stand down, Aaron.

22:46.730 --> 22:48.350
What do you need?

22:48.550 --> 22:50.350
Finding out what's going on
in there is a good start.

22:50.550 --> 22:51.680
It'd help if we had ears.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.400
That's where
we'll put our focus.

23:00.110 --> 23:02.090
You're going to need someone
to do proper stitches.

23:02.290 --> 23:03.900
What's happening?

23:04.100 --> 23:06.060
Mullen shut off all connection
with the outside.

23:06.260 --> 23:08.850
In other words, we're hostages.

23:10.150 --> 23:11.940
Let's hope you're better
at network communication

23:12.140 --> 23:13.840
than I am at wound closure.

23:14.040 --> 23:17.120
Well, it'd be the easiest thing
I do all day.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.280
Is it true that you applied
to be on the mission

23:20.480 --> 23:21.610
but didn't make the cut?

23:21.810 --> 23:24.120
Yeah. Packet was
sent in years ago.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.870
All I got back was
a "Thanks, but no thanks."

23:28.970 --> 23:30.220
Never said why.

23:30.420 --> 23:32.360
Seems like you would have
fit in just fine to me.

23:32.560 --> 23:33.760
(door beeps)

23:33.960 --> 23:36.840
What are you doing, Tom?
This is crazy.

23:38.050 --> 23:39.300
Everyone stays in here

23:39.500 --> 23:42.630
until I can get this mission
back on track.

23:42.830 --> 23:44.370
They are trying, Tom.

23:44.570 --> 23:47.410
But what happened to Commander
Graham is very serious.

23:47.610 --> 23:48.640
I'm doing what I have to do.

23:48.840 --> 23:49.720
Major Tom.

23:50.530 --> 23:53.360
Sorry. Must hate it
when people call you that.

23:54.160 --> 23:57.250
You don't get to talk.
You shouldn't even be here.

23:57.450 --> 23:59.380
You're going to mess things up,
just like all the others.

23:59.580 --> 24:02.920
Commander Graham wasn't
sabotaging anything.

24:03.120 --> 24:05.310
He did not deserve to die.

24:06.310 --> 24:07.730
Tom?

24:07.930 --> 24:10.230
Did you kill
Commander Graham?
No.

24:10.430 --> 24:12.960
I t-tried to get him removed
from the program.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.420
That's all. Uh...

24:15.220 --> 24:17.820
What are you doing?! (grunts)

24:20.890 --> 24:23.190
Don't make me do something
I'll regret.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.050
Little too late for that.

24:30.250 --> 24:31.900
That's the quarantine seal.

24:33.740 --> 24:35.270
We're not getting out.

24:36.970 --> 24:38.290
LUCY:
<i>How's Ernie?</i>

24:38.490 --> 24:40.060
Still trying to get eyes
and ears inside.

24:40.260 --> 24:41.360
What do you have?
LUCY:
We've been

24:41.560 --> 24:42.760
looking into people
with clearances

24:42.960 --> 24:44.060
tied to the project.

24:44.260 --> 24:45.900
And it turns out,
the person behind this

24:46.100 --> 24:47.030
may not be Thomas Mullen.

24:47.230 --> 24:48.570
LUCY:
Paolo Castile.

24:48.770 --> 24:49.900
WHISTLER:
Highly regarded member

24:50.100 --> 24:51.240
of the space exploration
community

24:51.440 --> 24:52.870
until he was fired
less than a week ago

24:53.070 --> 24:54.570
<i>and</i> had his clearance revoked.

24:54.770 --> 24:57.410
Apparently, he was involved
in a lot of the habitat design.

24:57.610 --> 24:59.710
Okay, well, if he was
so important, why was he fired?

24:59.910 --> 25:03.200
HR complaints cite
"ideological differences."

25:04.100 --> 25:05.680
And how did he take it?

25:05.880 --> 25:07.250
He had to be carried out
by security.

25:07.450 --> 25:08.750
LUCY:
You think he's trying
to bring down

25:08.950 --> 25:10.960
the whole simulation
as retaliation?

25:11.160 --> 25:12.620
Worth finding out.

25:12.820 --> 25:14.130
You have
a current address?

25:14.330 --> 25:16.290
JESSE:
<i>Getting fired is</i>

25:16.490 --> 25:18.760
pretty good motive for trying
to sabotage the mission.

25:18.960 --> 25:20.530
How'd he poison
Commander Graham

25:20.730 --> 25:22.070
from outside
the habitat, though?

25:22.270 --> 25:24.240
I mean, the guy's
literally a rocket scientist.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.570
Sneaking some poison is,
like, number 10,000

25:26.770 --> 25:29.270
on the most complicated list
of things he has to figure out.

25:29.470 --> 25:33.290
Well, guess it's a good thing
more geniuses aren't murderers.

25:35.060 --> 25:36.600
JESSE:
NCIS!
(gasps)

25:39.170 --> 25:41.090
Paolo Castile, you need
to come with us.

25:41.290 --> 25:42.640
I'm not going anywhere.

25:43.470 --> 25:44.640
Hey.

25:50.280 --> 25:51.380
Okay.

25:53.110 --> 25:54.670
Here's what's
going to happen.

25:54.870 --> 25:57.430
You're going to step outside,
and we're just going to talk.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.870
You're with them, aren't you?
We're with NCIS.

26:00.070 --> 26:03.310
No, you're with the ones who
are watching me. I know this!

26:03.510 --> 26:05.140
JESSE:
Looks like you've been doing
a fair bit

26:05.340 --> 26:06.580
of people-watching yourself.

26:06.780 --> 26:07.980
KAI:
And no one needs
to get hurt here, okay?

26:08.180 --> 26:09.850
You're lying! No!

26:10.050 --> 26:12.820
(yelling)

26:13.020 --> 26:15.000
(gasping)

26:26.610 --> 26:28.700
Okay. Why'd you try to jump?

26:28.900 --> 26:31.570
It's better than rotting
in the hands of big government.

26:31.770 --> 26:33.040
Because you're guilty?

26:33.240 --> 26:34.940
Of what?

26:35.140 --> 26:37.470
Well, aside from trying
to blast us with buckshot?

26:37.680 --> 26:39.110
KAI:
Poisoning Commander
Darren Graham

26:39.310 --> 26:40.880
and trying to sabotage
a multimillion dollar program.

26:41.080 --> 26:42.210
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:42.410 --> 26:43.680
I didn't poison him.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.080
You say that
like you know who did.

26:45.280 --> 26:46.180
Of course I do.

26:46.380 --> 26:47.620
Who?
The cabal

26:47.820 --> 26:49.550
who wants to blow up Mars.

26:49.750 --> 26:50.920
JESSE:
Okay. Great.

26:51.120 --> 26:52.720
He took the red pill.

26:52.920 --> 26:54.190
You know, I used to be like you.

26:54.390 --> 26:56.390
Just stuck in a myopic view
of the world,

26:56.590 --> 26:58.910
but things changed.
KAI:
Yeah?

26:59.710 --> 27:01.630
Okay. Educate us.

27:01.830 --> 27:03.840
I switched roles, okay?

27:04.040 --> 27:05.440
I got my head out
of the monitors,

27:05.640 --> 27:07.100
and it all became clearer.

27:07.300 --> 27:08.370
You switched roles to what?

27:08.570 --> 27:09.540
HVAC.

27:09.740 --> 27:11.280
I saw things for what they were.

27:11.480 --> 27:12.740
You got a capitalist mission

27:12.940 --> 27:14.750
sucking the air out of life
as we know it.

27:14.950 --> 27:17.580
Okay, these aren't, uh,
ideological differences.

27:17.780 --> 27:19.630
This guy's crazy.

27:22.040 --> 27:24.710
Maybe it's going around
these days.

27:25.740 --> 27:27.360
Just think about it.

27:27.560 --> 27:30.860
Commander Darren Graham-- he...
he was desperate to escape.

27:31.060 --> 27:32.700
Major Mullen takes
everyone hostage.

27:32.900 --> 27:34.370
Okay, you're doing it.

27:34.570 --> 27:37.990
You're opening your mind
to what's really happening.

27:38.790 --> 27:40.200
What are you...
what are you thinking--

27:40.400 --> 27:43.260
that it's affecting all of them,
and not just Graham?

27:44.560 --> 27:47.090
The system is
poisoning all of you.

27:49.400 --> 27:50.580
But to prove that,

27:50.780 --> 27:52.050
we're going to need
a blood sample.

27:52.250 --> 27:53.790
Oh, no way.

27:53.990 --> 27:56.790
This guy wants to clone me.

27:56.990 --> 27:58.460
No.

27:58.660 --> 28:01.010
One of you is, uh,
more than enough.

28:04.580 --> 28:06.430
All right, hey, man,

28:06.630 --> 28:08.730
how else are you gonna know

28:08.930 --> 28:11.790
if you haven't already
been bio-hacked?

28:15.060 --> 28:17.320
(quietly):
Do you think I have?

28:20.360 --> 28:21.780
(door opening)

28:21.980 --> 28:23.780
Special Agent Whistler.

28:23.980 --> 28:26.080
I sensed a new energy
coming in.

28:26.280 --> 28:27.720
You... sensed me?

28:27.920 --> 28:29.120
LUCY:
Ooh, and did you, uh, get

28:29.320 --> 28:32.190
a hint of strength
with a side of stern authority?

28:32.390 --> 28:35.030
Sincerity, actually.

28:35.230 --> 28:37.030
Aw.
And you arrived
just in time.

28:37.230 --> 28:39.730
The results from Paolo Castile's
blood test are in.

28:39.930 --> 28:42.470
He has organophosphates
in his blood.

28:42.670 --> 28:44.640
Organophos-what?
Nerve agents.

28:44.840 --> 28:46.200
CHASE:
Sometimes used in insecticides.

28:46.400 --> 28:49.170
Well, that's bad.
Sometimes in sarin and VX gas.

28:49.370 --> 28:52.110
Much worse.
At lower exposure,
organophosphates can cause

28:52.310 --> 28:54.110
confusion, anxiety,
loss of memory,

28:54.310 --> 28:55.950
disorientation, depression,
personality changes.

28:56.150 --> 28:59.850
And at greater exposure--
let me guess-- death?

29:00.050 --> 29:01.890
Records show that
just before Paolo was fired,

29:02.090 --> 29:03.890
he inspected several
HVAC components

29:04.090 --> 29:06.290
that were delivered to the
habitat, and Commander Graham

29:06.490 --> 29:08.160
and Major Mullen installed
those new components.

29:08.360 --> 29:10.230
Everyone who's come into contact
with those HVAC components

29:10.430 --> 29:12.530
has been showing signs
of being poisoned.

29:12.730 --> 29:14.500
But only Graham
has died from it.

29:14.700 --> 29:15.870
Best guess is,
Graham absorbed

29:16.070 --> 29:17.400
some of the agent
through his skin,

29:17.600 --> 29:18.800
while the others
merely inhaled it.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.640
But if the organophosphates

29:20.840 --> 29:22.240
are still in the HVAC system,

29:22.440 --> 29:23.780
it means that everyone

29:23.980 --> 29:25.310
in the habitat could
still be breathing it in.

29:25.510 --> 29:27.030
Including Ernie.

29:33.230 --> 29:34.490
ERNIE:
Hey.

29:34.690 --> 29:35.820
I have an idea.

29:36.020 --> 29:37.320
It's crazy, but then again,

29:37.520 --> 29:40.010
this isn't the first time
I'm being held hostage.

29:41.810 --> 29:45.100
Okay, next time
Major Mullen comes back in here,

29:45.300 --> 29:48.320
we can overtake him
and lock him in here.

29:50.680 --> 29:52.920
Hey, not that bad of an idea.

29:54.290 --> 29:56.320
Dr. Uchida?

30:02.100 --> 30:03.760
Your pupils.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.620
This isn't good.

30:10.820 --> 30:12.920
Paolo Castile's
in custody, swearing

30:13.120 --> 30:14.960
he didn't tamper
with the HVAC systems.

30:15.160 --> 30:16.490
Who else had
access to them?

30:16.690 --> 30:18.100
We're looking into it.

30:18.300 --> 30:19.830
Hey.

30:20.030 --> 30:21.500
You and I have
a new mission now--

30:21.700 --> 30:24.370
get everyone out safely
and find out who did this.

30:24.570 --> 30:25.840
Let's bring them home.

30:26.040 --> 30:27.970
My team is ready.

30:28.170 --> 30:29.570
Hey, we still don't have eyes
inside.

30:29.770 --> 30:32.240
We don't know
if it's safe to go in.

30:32.440 --> 30:34.030
It's your call, boss.

30:36.630 --> 30:40.100
Colonel McCarthy,
I need a favor.

30:41.540 --> 30:43.290
Dr. Uchida, whatever killed
Commander Graham,

30:43.490 --> 30:45.290
I think we're all
being exposed to it.

30:45.490 --> 30:47.020
We have to get out of here.
No.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.960
I mean, yes, but we have
to be smart about it.

30:49.160 --> 30:51.130
We're all going to die
if we stay in here, aren't we?

30:51.330 --> 30:53.650
How do I answer that
without you freaking out?

30:54.680 --> 30:56.800
Well, not that, apparently.
It's okay. It's okay.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.890
I'll think of something.
I'll think of something.

31:02.520 --> 31:06.610
Hey, does that machine
normally blink?

31:06.810 --> 31:07.850
Never.

31:08.050 --> 31:10.850
It's a sign.
We're going to die.

31:11.050 --> 31:12.780
You're right. It's a sign.

31:12.980 --> 31:14.650
Uh, not the dying part.

31:14.850 --> 31:16.370
It's Morse code.

31:18.070 --> 31:18.990
B.

31:19.190 --> 31:20.590
R. E.

31:20.790 --> 31:23.330
A. C.

31:23.530 --> 31:25.310
Breach.

31:26.210 --> 31:27.160
Oh, crap.

31:27.360 --> 31:29.180
They're coming in.
They're coming in.

31:30.620 --> 31:32.740
(both grunting)

31:32.940 --> 31:35.210
Run, now. Keep clear
of breaching points.

31:35.410 --> 31:36.240
(panting)

31:36.440 --> 31:37.710
Hey, go, go.

31:37.910 --> 31:38.740
Go. Go.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.430
Listen. (yelling)

31:41.730 --> 31:44.400
(explosions)

31:50.440 --> 31:52.440
Ernie?

31:53.240 --> 31:56.510
Kai, secure everyone here.
Jesse, with me.

32:00.380 --> 32:02.250
(grunting)

32:05.790 --> 32:08.570
(both grunting)

32:08.770 --> 32:10.990
Stay down!

32:13.660 --> 32:14.580
You all right?

32:14.780 --> 32:17.330
Remind me never to go to Mars.

32:20.900 --> 32:23.350
The crew is out and safe.

32:23.550 --> 32:25.320
Thank you for the assist.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.660
Well, you can thank me when
we figure out who's behind this.

32:27.860 --> 32:29.580
PATEL:
It's a deal.

32:31.380 --> 32:34.650
Well, at least
one mission was a success.

32:35.650 --> 32:37.700
We have a bigger problem,
Special Agent Tennant.

32:37.900 --> 32:39.500
Everything okay?

32:39.700 --> 32:41.410
What's that?
It's where

32:41.610 --> 32:43.620
the micro-nuclear reactor
was housed.

32:44.460 --> 32:46.010
You mean, the tech
that is so secret,

32:46.210 --> 32:48.100
only a handful of people
in the world have seen it?

32:49.100 --> 32:50.410
Was it damaged in the breach?

32:50.610 --> 32:53.230
No. It's been stolen.

33:01.510 --> 33:02.930
So, they weren't sabotaging
the habitat.

33:03.130 --> 33:04.860
They were creating a diversion
to steal from it.

33:05.060 --> 33:07.300
High risk pulling off
a heist in that habitat.

33:07.500 --> 33:08.730
It's high reward.

33:08.930 --> 33:10.430
A micro-nuclear reactor stands

33:10.630 --> 33:12.340
to make millions
on the black market.

33:12.540 --> 33:13.670
Whoever it was had
to be well-versed

33:13.870 --> 33:15.470
in the evacuation protocols

33:15.670 --> 33:17.470
<i>and</i> be in the habitat
during the breach.

33:17.670 --> 33:21.730
In other words... someone
from the Special Response Team.

33:23.100 --> 33:24.780
Whoa. Ernie,
shouldn't you be resting?

33:24.980 --> 33:27.650
My recovery can wait.
The future of humanity cannot.

33:27.850 --> 33:30.800
Dude, that seems a little...
Aaron Patel.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.760
Head of the
Special Response Team.

33:33.960 --> 33:35.590
He once applied
to the Mission to Mars program,

33:35.790 --> 33:37.460
and, like me, was rejected.

33:37.660 --> 33:38.860
Unlike me,
he concocted

33:39.060 --> 33:41.000
some way to ruin it
for everybody else.

33:41.200 --> 33:43.230
And if anybody knows about
the high tech that's in here,

33:43.430 --> 33:45.440
and how to sneak it out
during an emergency evacuation,

33:45.640 --> 33:47.570
it's him.

33:47.770 --> 33:49.370
And he could be resentful
from being rejected.

33:49.570 --> 33:50.840
JESSE:
Watching other people

33:51.040 --> 33:52.510
live out your dream every day--

33:52.710 --> 33:54.180
that's got to be grating.

33:54.380 --> 33:55.980
TENNANT:
Which means he had access,

33:56.180 --> 33:57.480
motive and opportunity.

33:57.680 --> 33:59.580
Any idea where he is now?

33:59.780 --> 34:01.520
No, but now I have a headache.

34:01.720 --> 34:02.850
Okay, guys, let's find him.

34:03.050 --> 34:04.810
Except for you, Ernie.
Get patched up.

34:08.510 --> 34:10.430
Hey. What'd you find?

34:10.630 --> 34:12.160
LUCY:
Well, Patel signed off

34:12.360 --> 34:13.700
on the HVAC components delivery

34:13.900 --> 34:15.730
before they were sent off
to the habitat.

34:15.930 --> 34:17.830
Meaning he had a chance to
deploy the nerve agent on them.

34:18.030 --> 34:19.470
LUCY:
And he was the only member
of Mission Control

34:19.670 --> 34:21.640
who hasn't swiped back in
since the evacuation.

34:21.840 --> 34:23.940
(computer chirps)
Hey, guys, we got something.

34:24.140 --> 34:26.810
You know a phone call
would have done just fine.

34:27.010 --> 34:28.550
Look, unless you have something
vitally important to say...

34:28.750 --> 34:30.480
I gave him permission to call.

34:30.680 --> 34:32.250
You found him.
ERNIE:
Aaron Patel

34:32.450 --> 34:34.690
recently booked a small plane
from the Dillingham Airfield

34:34.890 --> 34:37.150
to the Big Island. We have
a chance to beat him there.

34:37.350 --> 34:38.290
I would have done
that thing where

34:38.490 --> 34:39.390
I run in and tell you, except...

34:39.590 --> 34:40.520
I told him he couldn't.

34:40.720 --> 34:41.760
Good job, Ernie.

34:41.960 --> 34:43.090
Even better job,
Commander Chase.

34:43.290 --> 34:45.330
(clears throat)
Bye, Ernie. Love you.

34:45.530 --> 34:46.860
You good?
Hmm.

34:47.060 --> 34:48.470
You know what I <i>didn't</i>
dream of being as a child?

34:48.670 --> 34:50.520
A doctor. Ugh!

34:51.420 --> 34:53.870
(plane engine whirring)

34:54.070 --> 34:56.660
(siren blaring)

34:58.290 --> 35:00.110
Shoot.
I'm on foot.

35:00.310 --> 35:02.000
(tires squeal)

35:06.270 --> 35:08.940
(siren blaring)

35:10.870 --> 35:12.790
Hey, NCIS!

35:12.990 --> 35:14.810
He's running.

35:22.420 --> 35:23.720
Split up.

35:33.560 --> 35:35.450
(shouts)

35:35.650 --> 35:36.900
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

35:43.100 --> 35:45.360
(grunting)

35:45.560 --> 35:47.770
Don't... move.

35:53.680 --> 35:56.500
(groans, pants)

35:56.700 --> 35:58.540
Got those cellist reflexes.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.720
You're welcome.

36:02.290 --> 36:04.830
Have you considered playing
free safety for the Cowboys?

36:05.790 --> 36:08.030
(handcuffs clicking)

36:12.230 --> 36:14.820
Aaron Patel
confessed.
Uh,

36:15.020 --> 36:17.720
what Tennant meant
to say was she broke him.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.120
She got him to share

36:19.320 --> 36:20.560
all the intel he has

36:20.760 --> 36:21.930
on the black marketeers
he was dealing with

36:22.130 --> 36:23.330
and question his life choices.

36:23.530 --> 36:24.660
JESSE:
All this because he missed out

36:24.860 --> 36:26.360
on his dream of going
to Mars, huh?

36:26.560 --> 36:28.530
Wait. Speaking of dreams.

36:28.730 --> 36:30.430
Kate. What is yours, really?

36:30.630 --> 36:32.140
KAI:
Let me guess. I got it.

36:32.340 --> 36:33.640
CPA.

36:33.840 --> 36:35.010
JESSE:
This from the guy

36:35.210 --> 36:37.890
who refuses
to say what he wanted to be.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.610
The next Iron Chef.

36:40.810 --> 36:42.410
I like that.

36:42.610 --> 36:43.480
JESSE:
Yeah, chef,

36:43.680 --> 36:45.180
just like your dad.

36:45.380 --> 36:47.250
Do we need to unpack that?

36:47.450 --> 36:48.550
That's why I don't share things.

36:48.750 --> 36:49.650
(laughter)

36:49.850 --> 36:52.060
Okay, Kate, you're up.
Yeah.

36:52.260 --> 36:54.390
Come on, tell us.
What's the big deal?

36:54.590 --> 36:56.030
(whispering)

36:56.230 --> 36:59.930
Oh. Tell them!

37:00.130 --> 37:01.500
(sighs)

37:01.700 --> 37:03.250
Miss America.

37:06.150 --> 37:10.970
Kate would have been
a <i>great</i> Miss America.

37:11.170 --> 37:12.680
Well, I mostly liked the wave.

37:12.880 --> 37:15.700
(laughter)

37:16.730 --> 37:18.220
Excuse me, guys.

37:18.420 --> 37:20.180
Colonel McCarthy.

37:20.380 --> 37:22.750
I wanted to come by
and express my gratitude.

37:22.950 --> 37:24.990
If NASA ever needs
an investigative service

37:25.190 --> 37:28.040
on Mars,
I know who I'll be calling.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.760
NCIS: Mars. (laughs)

37:30.960 --> 37:33.630
Has a nice ring to it.
(chuckles)

37:33.830 --> 37:36.000
Look, I'm really sorry
about your mission.

37:36.200 --> 37:40.650
I appreciate that, but I'm not
here for condolences. I...

37:42.060 --> 37:44.580
Well, you convinced me
of what really matters.

37:44.780 --> 37:47.130
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

37:50.060 --> 37:52.770
You know, your team is lucky
to have you.

37:55.570 --> 37:57.970
Also, I did want
to give you this.

38:05.510 --> 38:07.080
(door opens)

38:08.550 --> 38:09.930
Hey, boss.
(door closes)

38:10.130 --> 38:11.350
Hey.

38:17.860 --> 38:20.040
This is the official review

38:20.240 --> 38:22.280
for my application
for the Mars Program.

38:22.480 --> 38:25.480
If you want to know
why they passed on you,

38:25.680 --> 38:28.370
it's in here.

38:29.370 --> 38:31.390
For the longest time,

38:31.590 --> 38:35.910
I tried to figure out
what being rejected meant.

38:36.840 --> 38:39.330
Was I not smart enough?

38:39.530 --> 38:41.470
Was I not fit enough?

38:41.670 --> 38:44.220
Did I not have the right stuff?

38:48.520 --> 38:50.210
Then I finally...

38:50.410 --> 38:54.140
got to the core
of what was really going on,

38:54.340 --> 38:56.430
why I cared so much.

39:01.940 --> 39:04.040
Daddy issues.

39:08.210 --> 39:10.530
I get that.

39:10.730 --> 39:12.410
Mommy issues.

39:15.050 --> 39:17.200
So are you really okay
not going all the way to Mars?

39:17.400 --> 39:19.190
Yeah.

39:19.990 --> 39:21.240
You know, you saved the lives

39:21.440 --> 39:23.320
of almost half a dozen people
today.

39:24.120 --> 39:27.360
You said you wanted to make
a difference in the world?

39:29.330 --> 39:31.800
I'd say you are.

39:35.070 --> 39:38.300
So...
dreams really do come true.

39:43.580 --> 39:45.060
I'm glad, because the toilets

39:45.260 --> 39:47.330
in the habitat
are not private at all.

39:47.530 --> 39:49.930
So Mars isn't all
it's cracked up to be?

39:50.130 --> 39:51.570
Oof.
(laughs softly)

39:51.770 --> 39:54.190
Well, next time, we can live out
<i>your</i> childhood dream.

39:57.290 --> 39:58.580
Okay, fine.

39:58.780 --> 40:00.440
Let's see.

40:00.640 --> 40:02.750
When I was five,

40:02.950 --> 40:05.650
I wanted to be a...

40:05.850 --> 40:07.820
unicorn wrangler.

40:08.020 --> 40:09.850
(laughs)
And when I was seven,

40:10.050 --> 40:11.790
I wanted to be a cross between

40:11.990 --> 40:13.720
Wonder Woman and Aquaman.

40:13.920 --> 40:16.510
