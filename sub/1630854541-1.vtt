Elizabeth!

00:47.567 --> 00:48.533
There you are.

00:48.667 --> 00:50.900
I wanted to introduce
Tom Burress, our new COO.

00:51.033 --> 00:52.900
Oh, uh... hello.

00:53.033 --> 00:55.300
Your mother tells me
you're at USC.

00:55.433 --> 00:57.834
Uh, yes,
I graduate in the Spring.

00:57.967 --> 00:59.233
With honors.

00:59.367 --> 01:00.700
Will you be joining
your mother's team at Etonnante?

01:00.834 --> 01:04.200
Elizabeth is in the graduate
journalism program.

01:04.333 --> 01:07.233
She just published a story
about predatory loans

01:07.367 --> 01:08.166
that is making quite the waves.

01:08.300 --> 01:09.967
You've chosen a field

01:10.100 --> 01:11.900
with very little
financial security.

01:12.033 --> 01:13.033
Well, and the ability

01:13.166 --> 01:14.700
to effect real,
meaningful change,

01:14.834 --> 01:16.266
and give a voice
to the voiceless.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.433
Nothing would make me happier

01:17.567 --> 01:19.667
than having Elizabeth
by my side,

01:19.800 --> 01:22.166
but she has her own path.

01:22.300 --> 01:24.166
I am really grateful
that my mom is just so support--

01:24.300 --> 01:26.300
Excuse me, Ms. Athens?

01:26.433 --> 01:27.834
You have a message
at the front desk.

01:29.033 --> 01:30.467
It was nice meeting you.

01:30.600 --> 01:31.700
You too.

01:33.934 --> 01:35.667
Oh, here's the Clarks.

01:35.800 --> 01:38.834
Hello!
Lovely to see you.

01:46.233 --> 01:48.066
Hi, uh,
I'm Elizabeth Athens.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.367
Hi, Ms. Athens?

01:49.500 --> 01:50.533
What can I do for you today?

01:50.667 --> 01:53.100
Oh, sorry, I was told
I have a message.

01:54.367 --> 01:57.100
Unfortunately,
I don't have a message for you.

01:57.233 --> 01:58.667
I've come to rescue you.

02:02.066 --> 02:03.600
Josh.

02:03.734 --> 02:05.266
From a Christmas party?

02:05.400 --> 02:06.900
That is not a Christmas party.

02:07.033 --> 02:09.633
That is a bunch of old men
in suits

02:09.767 --> 02:12.133
discussing
their investment portfolios.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.367
- That's not true.
- No?

02:13.500 --> 02:14.867
They're also
comparing their golf games.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.700
Come on, if we leave now,
we can make the Swapping Santa.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.333
My mother has been
asking about you.

02:23.467 --> 02:25.166
She made gingerbread cookies.

02:25.300 --> 02:27.333
The ones with
the little frosting bowties?

02:27.467 --> 02:28.400
You'd have to come
to find out.

02:28.533 --> 02:29.734
Don't worry,

02:29.867 --> 02:30.867
I'll get you back

02:31.000 --> 02:32.033
before you turn into a pumpkin.

02:32.166 --> 02:33.734

03:02.333 --> 03:04.266
I am so glad you made it!

03:04.400 --> 03:05.266
I promised her cookies, Ma.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.700
They're in the dining room,

03:06.834 --> 03:10.367
and I put a few extra
aside for you, so...

03:10.500 --> 03:13.166
Oh, thank you.

03:13.300 --> 03:15.033
- Josh told us the good news.
- Oh...

03:15.166 --> 03:17.900
We are just
so proud of you two.

03:18.033 --> 03:19.066
Betty!

03:19.200 --> 03:21.467
Is that your famous
figgy pudding I see?

03:23.233 --> 03:25.734
Hold it,
I got a surprise for you.

03:25.867 --> 03:26.867
I think it's in the kitchen.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.934
In addition to the cookies?

03:29.066 --> 03:30.533
Yes, you're gonna get
so many cookies.

03:30.667 --> 03:31.500
Just hold on.

03:31.633 --> 03:32.800
Okay.

03:35.066 --> 03:36.266
Andy?

03:37.967 --> 03:39.133
You're home? Come here!

03:39.266 --> 03:41.734
Oh, my gosh!

03:41.867 --> 03:43.233
I thought you were in Atlanta
for the holidays.

03:43.367 --> 03:44.800
Change of plans.

03:44.934 --> 03:46.033
You did not tell me.

03:46.166 --> 03:47.967
That wouldn't make it
a very good surprise, would it?

03:48.100 --> 03:50.734
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

03:50.867 --> 03:51.900
Cheers.

03:52.033 --> 03:53.500
- What?
- Yes.

03:53.633 --> 03:54.200
Aw...

03:54.333 --> 03:55.767
Wait for it.
Oh?

03:57.600 --> 03:59.233
Well, that's the best surprise.

04:00.333 --> 04:01.734
I'm so glad you're home.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.400
Come here.

04:06.433 --> 04:07.367
All right, come here.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.533
- Come on,
- Group hug, group hug.

04:08.667 --> 04:09.934
There's room
for all three of us here.

04:11.767 --> 04:13.300
...So Lizzie's camped out
in front of the Dean's office

04:13.433 --> 04:14.467
for hours--

04:14.600 --> 04:15.934
Well, it's the worst story.

04:16.066 --> 04:17.066
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.233
trying desperately
to wait him out

04:19.367 --> 04:20.900
to get a quote for our story.

04:21.033 --> 04:22.934
Okay, in a battle of wills,
I'm taking Lizzie every time.

04:23.066 --> 04:24.200
Yes, except for this time,

04:24.333 --> 04:25.767
because the Dean
had already gone home,

04:25.900 --> 04:27.900
and she was in a standoff
with an empty chair.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.734
Not the whole truth.

04:30.867 --> 04:32.800
No, no, no, no,
someone had tipped him off!

04:32.934 --> 04:34.200
So, did you get your quote?

04:34.333 --> 04:35.800
No. He's still dodging us.

04:35.934 --> 04:36.834
Well, who wouldn't,

04:36.967 --> 04:38.100
with Woodward and Bernstein
on your tail?

04:39.266 --> 04:40.834
Wait, did you tell him?

04:40.967 --> 04:42.300
Tell me what?

04:42.433 --> 04:45.033
We got an offer
to work for the New York Times.

04:45.166 --> 04:45.934
- What?
- Yeah.

04:46.066 --> 04:47.033
Amazing.

04:47.166 --> 04:49.000
Yeah, we start
after graduation.

04:49.133 --> 04:50.433
Yeah, I can't believe it.

04:50.567 --> 04:52.600
It's everything I--
well, we have ever wanted.

04:52.734 --> 04:56.000
We have an actual chance
to make a difference now.

04:56.133 --> 04:57.033
Oh, hey, there's a good one.

04:58.133 --> 04:59.633
- Yes.
- Oh...

04:59.767 --> 05:01.667
we are a little old
for Christmas wishes.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.133
It's tradition.

05:03.266 --> 05:04.333
It's tradition.
Come on, let's go,

05:04.467 --> 05:05.967
- everybody up.
- Yup.

05:06.100 --> 05:07.033
Close your eyes.

05:17.000 --> 05:17.934
What did you wish for?

05:18.066 --> 05:19.800
This.

05:19.934 --> 05:22.433
Another Christmas
with my two best friends.

05:23.333 --> 05:24.367
Selfie time!

05:24.500 --> 05:26.767
- Selfie time.
- Merry Christmas, guys.

05:26.900 --> 05:28.200
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

05:52.767 --> 05:53.400
I know, sorry.

05:53.533 --> 05:54.567
It's just holiday traffic.

05:54.700 --> 05:57.633
Yup, no,
I'm heading in right now.

06:06.734 --> 06:07.800
Hi.

06:20.367 --> 06:21.900
Sweetheart...

06:22.033 --> 06:24.333
I have a very important
question for you.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.367
- For the Christmas gala.
- Oh, um...

06:26.500 --> 06:27.934
I like the black.

06:28.066 --> 06:29.066
Really?

06:29.200 --> 06:30.934
Or the green.

06:31.066 --> 06:32.100
That's what I thought, too.

06:32.233 --> 06:33.333
Monica called

06:33.467 --> 06:34.800
and asked if we should
include a plus one

06:34.934 --> 06:35.967
on your invitation.

06:36.100 --> 06:37.367
Uh, no, not this year.

06:37.500 --> 06:40.533
You know, I think
Rosalie's son's in town.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.834
You two really hit it off
at the Spring mixer.

06:44.834 --> 06:45.867
Elizabeth,

06:46.000 --> 06:47.133
when is the last time
you had a date?

06:47.266 --> 06:49.567
Uh... I date.

06:50.433 --> 06:52.767
Honey, you don't date.

06:52.900 --> 06:55.400
You have networking lunches
and business meetings.

06:55.533 --> 06:57.333
I should really get this.

06:57.467 --> 06:58.867
You know,
it'd be good for you.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.533
Meet new people,
put yourself out there.

07:00.667 --> 07:01.867
You don't need
to worry about me.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.433
Honey, there's
a whole world outside.

07:04.567 --> 07:06.333
Things that
you're gonna miss out on

07:06.467 --> 07:07.934
hiding in here.

07:08.066 --> 07:10.033
It's 10:00 a.m. on a Monday,
I'm not hiding.

07:11.233 --> 07:13.767
I should really get this.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.033
Honey...

07:22.734 --> 07:23.800
Hey, Madelyn.

07:23.934 --> 07:25.467
It's me.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.200
It's been a minute, huh?

07:27.333 --> 07:28.400
I got your new number,

07:28.533 --> 07:29.967
and I wanted to call you,

07:30.100 --> 07:31.000
I hope that's okay.

07:31.133 --> 07:33.467
I'm sure you're surprised
to hear from me,

07:33.600 --> 07:35.066
but I've been
thinking about you...

07:35.200 --> 07:36.066
about us

07:36.200 --> 07:37.500
a lot.

07:37.633 --> 07:39.300
I got in this morning,

07:39.433 --> 07:41.533
and I even stopped
at Sweeteats.

07:41.667 --> 07:43.233
They still have
those caramel turtles

07:43.367 --> 07:44.967
you like so much.

07:45.100 --> 07:46.300
I miss you, Maddy.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.800
I know I've made
a lot of mistakes,

07:48.934 --> 07:51.166
but I'm trying
to make things right.

07:51.300 --> 07:53.133
I know you're probably busy
with the holidays,

07:53.266 --> 07:57.800
but if there is any chance
that you feel the same,

07:57.934 --> 08:00.400
I'll be at our spot,
Christmas Eve, 9:00.

08:00.533 --> 08:01.400
I hope to see you there,

08:01.533 --> 08:02.633
but if I don't,

08:02.767 --> 08:03.900
I understand.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.400
Hello, Guildcrest Hotel.

08:14.533 --> 08:16.233
Hi, um... I received
a call at this number.

08:16.367 --> 08:17.333
Name?

08:17.467 --> 08:19.533
Uh, my name
is Elizabeth Athens.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.367
No, the name of the person
you're trying to reach.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.600
Oh, I don't know.

08:23.734 --> 08:26.433
He didn't leave his name, actually.

08:26.567 --> 08:27.800
I just, I was hoping
you could tell me.

08:27.934 --> 08:29.000
It could be any of the guests

08:29.133 --> 08:30.934
making an outgoing call
from their room.

08:31.066 --> 08:32.133
They all route
through the front desk.

08:32.266 --> 08:33.133
Oh.

08:34.500 --> 08:35.433
Well, thank you.

08:35.567 --> 08:37.100
Have a very merry Christmas.

08:37.233 --> 08:38.166
You, too.

09:00.166 --> 09:01.934
Housekeeping!

09:02.066 --> 09:03.300
Just a moment.

09:34.600 --> 09:35.867
He probably
realized his mistake

09:36.000 --> 09:37.166
the moment he hung up the phone.

09:37.300 --> 09:39.400
But what if he didn't?

09:39.533 --> 09:40.867
Oh, well, I wouldn't
worry about it.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.800
A couple days of no response,

09:42.934 --> 09:44.767
and, you know,
he'll put it together.

09:44.900 --> 09:46.667
It just doesn't feel right
to erase the message.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.200
He poured his heart out.

09:48.333 --> 09:49.967
To someone else.

09:50.100 --> 09:52.300
You were never meant
to hear that message.

09:52.433 --> 09:54.533
I just keep picturing him
sitting there on Christmas Eve,

09:54.667 --> 09:56.667
and he's waiting for her
to walk through the door,

09:56.800 --> 09:59.100
and he's thinking
she just stood him up.

09:59.233 --> 10:01.900
Well, there's nothing
you can do about it now.

10:02.033 --> 10:05.033
You don't know
anything about him.

10:15.266 --> 10:16.667
He is one of your guests.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.333
We have 1,500 rooms.

10:18.467 --> 10:19.400
Fully booked for the holidays.

10:19.533 --> 10:20.934
That's over 3,000 guests.

10:21.066 --> 10:21.967
There's got be some way
to find out

10:22.100 --> 10:23.333
which one of them
made the phone call.

10:23.467 --> 10:24.600
As I explained before,

10:24.734 --> 10:26.166
- if you don't have a name--
- I understand.

10:26.300 --> 10:27.333
I would not be here

10:27.467 --> 10:28.533
if this was not very,
very important

10:28.667 --> 10:29.967
that I get this message to him.

10:30.100 --> 10:32.700
Look, I even wrote it down,
word for word.

10:32.834 --> 10:35.100
That's everything
on my voicemail.

10:35.233 --> 10:36.133
Ma'am, I can't...

10:36.266 --> 10:37.767
But can you just put it
in the hotel lobby,

10:37.900 --> 10:38.867
or go door to door.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.800
Please do something,
it's Christmas.

10:40.934 --> 10:43.033
I am asking you just to try.

10:43.166 --> 10:46.066
Have you never had a regret
that was just so big,

10:46.200 --> 10:47.600
that you would do anything
for a second chance

10:47.734 --> 10:49.133
to make it right?

10:50.800 --> 10:52.367
I wish I could help, I do...

10:53.767 --> 10:55.166
...but my hands are tied.

10:56.367 --> 10:58.200
Welcome
to the Guildcrest Hotel.

10:58.333 --> 11:00.200
Checking in?

11:04.834 --> 11:06.200
You're back.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.000
Sir?

11:08.133 --> 11:08.967
Hart.

11:09.100 --> 11:10.266
Josh Hart.

11:11.467 --> 11:12.633
Please review here and sign,

11:12.767 --> 11:14.133
and we'll get you checked in.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.367
Excuse me

11:16.500 --> 11:18.533
Yeah, right...

11:18.667 --> 11:20.066
I'll go this way.

11:25.934 --> 11:28.233
Here, just, um, please...

11:28.367 --> 11:30.066
do the right thing.

11:36.066 --> 11:37.333
All right, here's your key.

11:37.467 --> 11:38.467
Room 314.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.266
Just right to the right.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.900
Thanks.

11:42.033 --> 11:44.033
Welcome to
the Guildcrest hotel.

11:44.166 --> 11:45.400
Checking in?

11:54.767 --> 11:56.133
Elizabeth!

11:56.266 --> 11:59.166
The clerk tossed it
as soon as you left.

11:59.300 --> 12:00.433
Oh.

12:00.567 --> 12:02.467
So much for
Goodwill Towards Men.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.500
Who's Madelyn?

12:04.633 --> 12:06.767
I don't know.

12:06.900 --> 12:07.900
It was a wrong number,

12:08.033 --> 12:09.567
and I was just
delivering the message.

12:09.700 --> 12:10.934
It's in their hands now.

12:11.066 --> 12:14.200
Actually, it's in mine.

12:14.333 --> 12:15.500
It...

12:15.633 --> 12:17.066
Christmas Eve
is in three days.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.667
I know.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.000
So, what are you going to do?

12:20.133 --> 12:21.600
Nothing.

12:21.734 --> 12:23.033
It's not my problem.

12:23.166 --> 12:23.834
I did my part.

12:23.967 --> 12:26.266
The hotel isn't going to help.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.400
What am I supposed to do?

12:27.533 --> 12:28.600
There's thousands of guests.

12:28.734 --> 12:29.700
I don't have a single lead.

12:29.834 --> 12:31.667
That's never stopped you before.

12:31.800 --> 12:36.033
Yeah, well, things change.

12:36.166 --> 12:37.667
People change.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.133
You'd know that
if you stuck around.

12:53.066 --> 12:53.767
Hi, Ma.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.633
There's my boy.

12:56.867 --> 12:58.500
All right, all right.

13:00.734 --> 13:01.533
Where are your bags?

13:01.667 --> 13:02.533
I got a room

13:02.667 --> 13:03.967
- at the Guildcrest.
- What?

13:04.100 --> 13:04.934
You got a full house here,

13:05.066 --> 13:05.967
Charlotte, Keith, the baby...

13:06.100 --> 13:07.767
Nonsense, we can make space.

13:07.900 --> 13:09.700
I had your father
bring down the rollout.

13:09.834 --> 13:10.700
Well, as luxurious
as that sounds,

13:10.834 --> 13:12.300
I think
for the sake of my back,

13:12.433 --> 13:13.600
- I'm gonna stick to the hotel.
- No, I--

13:13.734 --> 13:14.867
It's all right,
come on, what do you need?

13:15.000 --> 13:16.834
You got a lot of bags here.

13:16.967 --> 13:19.667
Yeah. I stopped at
Halliday's Christmas market,

13:19.800 --> 13:20.834
I picked up a few things.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.700
Wow, thank you.
You got it?

13:22.834 --> 13:23.600
- Got it.
- Okay, good.

13:23.734 --> 13:24.867
No peeking.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.834
Yeah, no, I can't see
anything here, Ma.

13:34.633 --> 13:36.667
It might be nice to reconnect
with some old friends

13:36.800 --> 13:39.467
while you're back...

13:43.266 --> 13:45.433
Does she know
you're here for Christmas?

13:45.567 --> 13:47.000
Trying to get rid of me
already?

13:48.233 --> 13:51.867
I am so happy
to have you home.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.233
It's been too long.

13:56.367 --> 13:58.100
I know.

14:04.934 --> 14:07.900
...If there is any chance

14:08.033 --> 14:09.734
that you feel the same,

14:09.867 --> 14:13.400
I'll be at our spot
Christmas Eve. 9:00.

14:13.533 --> 14:14.567
I hope to see you there,

14:14.700 --> 14:16.200
but if I don't,

14:16.333 --> 14:17.567
I understand.

14:25.900 --> 14:27.367
I'm in the city for a few days.

14:27.500 --> 14:31.600
I got in this morning,
and I thought of you.

14:31.734 --> 14:35.300
I even stopped at Sweeteats.

Are you still
thinking about traveling?

15:39.066 --> 15:42.333
Actually, I think
I might come home, for good.

15:42.467 --> 15:43.867
Really?

15:44.000 --> 15:46.400
I've got
my whole life to travel

15:46.533 --> 15:47.500
I miss this place.

15:47.633 --> 15:48.667
The people...

15:48.800 --> 15:50.433
you.

15:51.900 --> 15:53.233
I'm really glad
you came tonight.

15:53.367 --> 15:55.934
I was hoping, um...

15:56.066 --> 15:57.800
I could talk to you
about something

15:57.934 --> 15:58.967
A good something, or...

15:59.100 --> 16:00.734
Good.
Well, hopefully.

It's just about the future,

16:02.266 --> 16:03.533
about the things I want

16:03.667 --> 16:05.600

Us?

16:06.867 --> 16:07.667

on you, though.

16:52.166 --> 16:52.967
Yeah, it is.

16:53.100 --> 16:53.834
He's got your eyes.

16:53.967 --> 16:55.400
And Keith's appetite.

16:55.533 --> 16:57.133
I swear I haven't slept more
than three hours straight

16:57.266 --> 16:59.166
since he was born.

16:59.300 --> 17:00.633
Yeah!

17:00.767 --> 17:01.900
How is Michigan?

17:02.033 --> 17:03.200
Uh, it's good.

17:03.333 --> 17:04.667
Yeah, I put an offer on a house.
You wanna see it?

17:04.800 --> 17:06.266
It's a Craftsman.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.767
Probably do
all the renovations myself.

17:07.900 --> 17:10.800
Everything except for plumbing,
electrical, masonry...

17:10.934 --> 17:13.100
So you're gonna
pick out the paint?

17:13.233 --> 17:14.633
Yeah.
I'm thinking taupe.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.266
It's very nice.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.000
Although, I had hoped

17:18.133 --> 17:19.600
that when you were ready
to plant your roots,

17:19.734 --> 17:20.633
it would have been here,

17:20.767 --> 17:21.633
back home.

17:21.767 --> 17:22.800
Yeah, I know.

17:24.066 --> 17:25.033
That's enough swiping.

17:25.166 --> 17:26.433
I got a job there, Ma,

17:26.567 --> 17:27.800
and I got friends.

17:27.934 --> 17:28.834
Yeah, it's home.

17:30.200 --> 17:31.533
Okay, hungry?

17:31.667 --> 17:32.900
I know.

17:33.033 --> 17:34.533
Looking this cute
is such hard work.

17:34.667 --> 17:35.633
I got him.

17:35.767 --> 17:37.266
Oh...

17:37.400 --> 17:38.667
His bottles
are in the kitchen.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.533
Hey.

17:40.667 --> 17:41.633
Hi.

17:43.033 --> 17:44.233
Yeah.

17:45.800 --> 17:46.667
Thank you kindly.

17:46.800 --> 17:47.800
Are you all right?

17:47.934 --> 17:49.133
You've been a bit quiet.

17:49.266 --> 17:51.033
I ran into Elizabeth.

17:51.166 --> 17:52.500
How is she?

17:52.633 --> 17:53.533
I don't know,

17:53.667 --> 17:54.533
only talked for a minute,

17:54.667 --> 17:55.734
maybe not even that.

17:55.867 --> 17:58.100
Are you going to get together
while you're in town?

17:58.233 --> 18:00.767
Nah, she kind of
gave me the brush-off.

18:02.734 --> 18:04.100
Fair warning, everyone,

18:04.233 --> 18:06.033
Charlotte is ruthless.

18:06.166 --> 18:07.266
Okay, what's the point
of playing

18:07.400 --> 18:08.967
if you don't play to win?

18:09.100 --> 18:10.767
You coming?

18:10.900 --> 18:12.100
I don't have a gift.

18:12.233 --> 18:13.367
I got you one.

18:14.767 --> 18:17.066
You save me every time.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.433
Come on.

18:22.533 --> 18:23.433
Wanna trade?

18:23.567 --> 18:24.400
No, game's over.

18:24.533 --> 18:25.300
Ugh, please?

18:25.433 --> 18:26.667
I really wanted a gift basket.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.633
What am I going to do
with two tickets to a ballet?

18:28.767 --> 18:31.133
Well, you could always
take, uh, Elizabeth.

18:31.266 --> 18:33.333
Not a bad first date.

18:33.467 --> 18:34.200
A date?

18:34.333 --> 18:36.166
I know you like her.

18:37.266 --> 18:39.266
Yeah, of course, I like her.
She's my best friend.

18:39.400 --> 18:40.734
And you wish she was more.

18:40.867 --> 18:42.233
It's obvious.

18:42.367 --> 18:43.433
It's obvious...

18:43.567 --> 18:45.400
Is it obvious?

18:49.934 --> 18:50.800
Think it's obvious to her?

18:50.934 --> 18:53.100
Well, you could always
take her

18:53.233 --> 18:55.433
to a matinee of "The Nutcracker"

18:55.567 --> 18:56.533
and find out.

18:58.800 --> 18:59.734
Can you take a chance?

19:04.900 --> 19:06.800
I'll take these.

19:06.934 --> 19:08.000
Thank you.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.467
All of them.

19:26.800 --> 19:27.834
- Hi.
- Hi!

19:27.967 --> 19:29.033
Can I help you with something?

19:29.166 --> 19:30.767
- I am looking for a man.
- Aren't we all?

19:31.900 --> 19:33.233
He's a customer of yours.

19:33.367 --> 19:34.734
He was here yesterday,

19:34.867 --> 19:36.066
sometime before noon.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.667
We get a lot of customers
over the holidays.

19:37.800 --> 19:38.533
What did he look like?

19:38.667 --> 19:39.767
I don't know.

19:39.900 --> 19:40.934
Um... yeah.

19:41.066 --> 19:43.467
He bought a box
of your turtles.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.266
Well, that's
our most popular item.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.233
We sell dozens a day.

19:46.367 --> 19:47.266
Would you like to try one?

19:47.400 --> 19:48.400
Oh, no, thank you.

19:48.533 --> 19:49.500
Best of Seattle
six years running.

19:49.633 --> 19:50.300
Okay.

19:50.433 --> 19:52.533
Six years running, huh? Mm!

19:53.367 --> 19:55.500
- Very good.
- Right?

19:55.633 --> 19:57.066
Would you happen to have
sales receipts I could look at?

19:57.200 --> 19:58.200
Just the ones

19:58.333 --> 19:59.100
of the credit card
customers yesterday.

19:59.233 --> 20:00.300
I'm sorry,

20:00.433 --> 20:02.133
I can't disclose
customer information.

20:02.266 --> 20:04.033
Oh, I understand.

20:04.166 --> 20:05.800
- Thank you for your help.
- Merry Christmas.

20:08.033 --> 20:09.734
One entry
with every purchase.

20:09.867 --> 20:11.934
Winner gets six boxes of
our famous chocolate truffles.

20:12.066 --> 20:13.166
Hmm.

20:13.300 --> 20:14.600
The sign-in sheet
is just right there.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.600
On second thought,

20:19.734 --> 20:21.934
I actually will take
a box of those turtles.

20:22.066 --> 20:23.633
Great.

20:33.266 --> 20:34.667
Thank you so much.

20:46.734 --> 20:48.066
Here we go again.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.600
You went to Sweeteats.

20:50.734 --> 20:52.367
You asked about
your mystery caller, didn't you?

20:52.500 --> 20:53.934
I just wanted chocolates.

20:54.066 --> 20:55.300
Did you?

20:56.266 --> 20:57.967
The owner didn't remember him.

20:58.100 --> 20:58.867
Did you ask for--

20:59.000 --> 20:59.967
- Receipts?
- Yeah.

21:00.166 --> 21:01.834
They're under lock and key.

21:01.967 --> 21:02.834
Okay.

21:03.800 --> 21:04.734
Oh, sorry.

21:04.867 --> 21:07.700
Hi! Ah, thank you
for returning my call.

21:07.834 --> 21:10.133
I'm looking for someone
who left a voicemail yesterday.

21:10.266 --> 21:11.367
He was trying to reach
a Madelyn?

21:12.500 --> 21:13.600
No? All right, well,
thank you for your time.

21:13.734 --> 21:15.300
Merry Christmas.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.433
There was a sign-up sheet
for the holiday raffle,

21:19.567 --> 21:20.800
and customers can leave
their name and number

21:20.934 --> 21:21.567
to win a prize.

21:21.700 --> 21:23.500
They just let you have it?

21:23.633 --> 21:25.667
I took photos of the sheets

21:25.800 --> 21:27.266
while they were
gift-wrapping my purchase.

21:27.400 --> 21:28.333
There you go.

21:28.467 --> 21:29.633
Looks like a lot of numbers...

21:29.767 --> 21:30.767
There's six down.

21:30.900 --> 21:31.934
63 to go.

21:32.066 --> 21:33.100
People aren't really thrilled

21:33.233 --> 21:34.100
about unsolicited calls

21:34.233 --> 21:35.900
three days before Christmas.

21:36.033 --> 21:37.900
I should... get back to it.

21:38.033 --> 21:39.266
Yeah, of course, I'm sorry.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.533
- I'll leave you to it.
- Mm-hmm.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.367
You need, uh, help?

21:47.266 --> 21:48.633
You want to help?

21:48.767 --> 21:50.000
63 numbers to go.

21:50.133 --> 21:51.000
Faster with two of us.

22:18.300 --> 22:19.533
Carter?

22:19.667 --> 22:20.967
Pete.

22:21.100 --> 22:21.934
Whoa...

22:26.033 --> 22:26.967
Come on in.

22:31.300 --> 22:32.166
Here you go.

22:32.300 --> 22:33.767
Thanks.

22:35.667 --> 22:36.633
Sorry, I should have
called ahead.

22:36.767 --> 22:37.934
I'm meeting Nancy and the boys

22:38.066 --> 22:39.567
at her parents' in Asheville.

22:39.700 --> 22:41.200
Nice. How are they doing?

22:41.333 --> 22:43.100
They're really good.

22:44.367 --> 22:46.166
I wish you would have
told me you were coming.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.133
It was a last-minute decision.

22:52.033 --> 22:53.033
It's really good to see you.

22:53.166 --> 22:54.533
You too.

22:54.667 --> 22:56.266
Been worried about you.

22:56.400 --> 22:58.233
We all have.

22:58.367 --> 23:00.500
I'm sorry, I...

23:00.633 --> 23:02.333
I should have
reached out sooner.

23:02.467 --> 23:03.934
So how have you been?

23:04.066 --> 23:06.033
Where are you living now?

23:06.166 --> 23:08.000
I'm working out of Tucson,

23:08.133 --> 23:08.834
building furniture.

23:08.967 --> 23:10.000
Is that so?

23:10.133 --> 23:10.867
Yeah.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.033
I like it.

23:12.166 --> 23:12.900
I get to work with my hands.

23:13.033 --> 23:14.033
It's...

23:14.166 --> 23:16.367
It's been really good for me.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.200
How long are you in Seattle?

23:18.333 --> 23:19.834
Just through Christmas.

23:22.700 --> 23:25.133
I'm hoping to see Madelyn.

23:25.266 --> 23:26.133
Madelyn?

23:26.266 --> 23:27.867
You're back in touch?

23:29.000 --> 23:30.533
No, not yet...

23:31.333 --> 23:32.600
...but she's in the city,

23:32.734 --> 23:35.633
and I'm here for her.

23:37.633 --> 23:39.900
I made a lot of mistakes,

23:40.033 --> 23:41.400
I know that, Pete,

23:41.533 --> 23:44.166
but one of
the biggest ones was...

23:44.300 --> 23:45.633
letting her go.

23:45.767 --> 23:48.166
It's been a long time.

23:48.300 --> 23:49.900
Are you sure she feels the same?

23:51.000 --> 23:53.166
That's what I'm here
to find out.

23:56.567 --> 23:59.166
In the flesh.

23:59.300 --> 24:00.934
I missed you, brother.

24:03.834 --> 24:05.433
Well, you have
a merry Christmas.

24:05.567 --> 24:06.900
Thank you very much.

24:08.433 --> 24:11.433
Okay, that is a no
on, "Keith Porter".

24:11.567 --> 24:12.633
You can cross off
"David Kline".

24:12.767 --> 24:14.133
His mother's pretty sure
he didn't make the call.

24:14.266 --> 24:16.533
David is 12.

24:16.667 --> 24:17.500
You know, a wrong number
is the reason why

24:17.633 --> 24:18.667
we have the Santa tracker?

24:18.800 --> 24:20.667
- Hmm?
- Newspaper printed a typo,

24:20.800 --> 24:22.066
and all the kids
trying to reach Santa that year

24:22.200 --> 24:23.033
called NORAD.

24:23.166 --> 24:24.600
Well, too bad
our mystery guy didn't.

24:24.734 --> 24:26.667
They'd have better luck
tracking him down.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.133
Yeah.

24:28.266 --> 24:30.567
Okay, 15 left.

24:30.700 --> 24:32.834
It's gotta be in there.
Who can resist a raffle?

24:34.800 --> 24:37.433
So you just, uh,
home for Christmas?

24:37.567 --> 24:39.033
Yeah. Yeah,
Charlotte had her baby,

24:39.166 --> 24:40.266
so I couldn't miss this one.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.033
Aw, tell her congratulations.

24:42.166 --> 24:43.400
I will.

24:43.533 --> 24:44.600
Are you still in Michigan?

24:44.734 --> 24:46.166
Yeah, I got a job
with a publishing company.

24:46.300 --> 24:47.500
Mm.

24:47.633 --> 24:48.600
I was surprised to hear

24:48.734 --> 24:49.867
that you went to work
with your mother.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.400
I can't believe
the New York Times

24:51.533 --> 24:52.800
would rescind their offer.

24:52.934 --> 24:54.033
They didn't.

24:54.166 --> 24:55.734
Why didn't you take it?

24:56.700 --> 25:00.700
After Andrew's death,
I just, um...

25:00.834 --> 25:04.800
Well, everything got
really confusing, so...

25:04.934 --> 25:06.500
It just helps
to be around family.

25:06.633 --> 25:09.166
The Times
was your dream, though.

25:09.300 --> 25:10.667
Well, sometimes,

25:10.800 --> 25:13.300
things just don't work out
the way you planned.

25:22.233 --> 25:23.266
Have you seen Elizabeth?

25:23.400 --> 25:24.567
No.

25:24.700 --> 25:27.200
I know it's a lot to take in.

25:28.433 --> 25:30.800
Well, say something.

25:30.934 --> 25:33.800
How long
have you felt this way?

25:33.934 --> 25:35.100
It's been a while.

25:35.233 --> 25:37.300
It just snuck up on me.

25:39.367 --> 25:40.600
I haven't said anything

25:40.734 --> 25:42.834
because I know it's going
to change things between us,

25:42.967 --> 25:43.900
but I don't know how much longer

25:44.033 --> 25:45.633
I can just go on being friends

25:45.767 --> 25:48.000
when I do want more.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.233
Excuse me.

26:00.467 --> 26:01.834
I tried calling you.

26:01.967 --> 26:02.867
I know.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.367
I shouldn't have ignored you.

26:04.500 --> 26:06.200
So why did you?

26:06.333 --> 26:08.700
I thought it would be easier,

26:08.834 --> 26:10.934
to get away from the city.

26:12.133 --> 26:13.800
Away from me?

26:13.934 --> 26:14.967
You?

26:15.100 --> 26:16.734
Andy would have never been
on that road that night

26:16.867 --> 26:17.734
if it weren't for me.

26:17.867 --> 26:19.734
It wasn't your fault.

26:19.867 --> 26:21.200
The other driver
hit a patch of ice.

26:21.333 --> 26:22.400
You had nothing to do with it.

26:22.533 --> 26:23.834
I was the reason he left.

26:23.967 --> 26:25.233
If I would have just
stayed at the party

26:25.367 --> 26:26.567
like Andy had asked me to,
it would have--

26:29.233 --> 26:30.800
Hello? Hi.

26:30.934 --> 26:33.133
Uh, no, thank you
for returning my call.

26:33.266 --> 26:36.433
Yeah, I was looking for someone
that left a voicemail...

26:37.800 --> 26:39.700
He was trying to reach
a Madelyn?

26:59.500 --> 27:01.133
Where are you going?

27:02.266 --> 27:04.233
I'm going to go out
for some air.

27:23.367 --> 27:24.233
That's it.

27:24.367 --> 27:25.934
That's the last name.

27:26.066 --> 27:27.600
I'm sorry.
It was a good idea.

27:27.734 --> 27:28.767
It was my only idea.

27:28.900 --> 27:30.100
I should just delete it.

27:30.233 --> 27:31.600
I just can't
bring myself to do it.

27:31.734 --> 27:33.166
It wasn't even
the sadness in his voice,

27:33.300 --> 27:34.300
it was the hope.

27:35.600 --> 27:36.800
Can I hear the message?

27:36.934 --> 27:38.400
Yeah, you read it.
You know what it says.

27:38.533 --> 27:39.400
Indulge me?

27:42.734 --> 27:43.600
Hey, Madelyn.

27:43.734 --> 27:45.133
It's me.

27:45.266 --> 27:47.834
I got your new number,
and I wanted to call you.

27:47.967 --> 27:49.066
I hope that's okay.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.967
I'm sure you're surprised
to hear from me,

27:51.100 --> 27:54.300
but I've been thinking
about you, about us,

27:54.433 --> 27:55.600
a lot.

27:55.734 --> 27:56.834
I got in this morning,

27:56.967 --> 27:59.600
and I even stopped
at Sweeteats.

27:59.734 --> 28:00.800
They still have

28:00.934 --> 28:02.900
those caramel turtles
you like so much.

28:03.033 --> 28:04.800
I miss you, Maddy.

28:04.934 --> 28:09.934
I know I've made
a lot of mistakes...

28:10.066 --> 28:12.000
but I'm trying to make
things right.

28:12.133 --> 28:13.734
I can see why it made
an impression.

28:13.867 --> 28:15.100
Mm-hmm.

28:15.233 --> 28:16.567
I know you're probably busy
with the holidays,

28:16.700 --> 28:20.100
but if there is any chance
that you feel the same--

28:20.233 --> 28:22.367
Wait, stop it.
What was that?

28:22.500 --> 28:23.767
- What?
- In the background.

28:23.900 --> 28:25.834
Play it again?

28:27.567 --> 28:28.533
if there is any chance--

28:30.100 --> 28:30.867
There.
- that you feel the same--

28:31.000 --> 28:32.266
There's a song playing.

28:32.400 --> 28:33.467
I'll be at our spot--

28:33.600 --> 28:35.700
Probably the television...

28:35.834 --> 28:36.900
No, it's too close
to the receiver.

28:37.033 --> 28:38.333
It starts mid-message.

28:38.467 --> 28:39.333
Christmas Eve, 9:00--

28:39.467 --> 28:40.233
You think it's important?

28:40.367 --> 28:41.233
I don't know.

28:41.367 --> 28:42.633
Recognize the song?

28:42.767 --> 28:44.100
Mm-mm.

28:44.233 --> 28:46.066
Yeah, I know,
it's not much of a lead, but...

28:46.200 --> 28:48.967
Hey, this is better
than anything we've got.

28:50.333 --> 28:51.900
I think I know somebody
who can help us.

29:02.633 --> 29:03.467
It hasn't changed.

29:03.600 --> 29:04.467
No, it hasn't--

29:04.600 --> 29:05.867
Lizzie?

29:06.000 --> 29:07.800
Oh, it is you.

29:07.934 --> 29:10.233
Aren't you
a sight for sore eyes!

29:10.367 --> 29:11.300
Hi, Sharon!

29:11.433 --> 29:13.333
Oh, Merry Christmas.

29:13.467 --> 29:15.767
Oh, we've missed you
around these parts.

29:15.900 --> 29:17.633
Josh, you didn't tell me
he was bringing you by.

29:17.767 --> 29:20.166
We bumped into each other, Mom.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.000
Well, what luck.

29:22.133 --> 29:23.533
Is Charlotte here?

29:23.667 --> 29:24.867
Yeah, she's in the kitchen,

29:25.000 --> 29:26.133
she's helping me
with the gingerbread men!

29:26.266 --> 29:28.033
The ones with
the frosted bow ties?

29:28.166 --> 29:30.400
The ones with the frosted
bow ties.

29:30.533 --> 29:31.767
I'll be at our spot--

29:32.934 --> 29:34.066
Christmas Eve, 9:00.

29:34.200 --> 29:37.800
I don't recognize the song,

29:37.934 --> 29:39.467
but it sounds like
it's coming from a music box.

29:39.600 --> 29:40.834
How can you tell?

29:40.967 --> 29:41.867
The tone
is very distinctive.

29:42.000 --> 29:42.900
It comes from plucking
a steel comb.

29:43.033 --> 29:44.333
- Hmm.
- You said the guy

29:44.467 --> 29:45.967
made the phone call
from a hotel room, right?

29:46.100 --> 29:47.500
Who travels with a music box?

29:47.633 --> 29:48.567
Maybe he bought it as a gift?

29:48.700 --> 29:50.066
Yeah.

29:50.200 --> 29:52.233
We know he stopped
at the candy shop, right?

29:52.367 --> 29:53.934
Maybe he made another purchase?

29:54.066 --> 29:55.000
Which means we might have
another place

29:55.133 --> 29:56.066
that someone can ID him.

29:56.200 --> 29:56.834
Right.

29:56.967 --> 29:57.800
What if

29:57.934 --> 29:59.800
we looked up all the stores

29:59.934 --> 30:01.033
that have music boxes
available for sale?

30:01.166 --> 30:03.000
Then we could narrow the search

30:03.133 --> 30:04.166
to the local vendors.

30:04.300 --> 30:05.000
Okay.

30:05.133 --> 30:07.000
Just one small problem.

30:07.133 --> 30:09.934
That mechanism isn't unique
to music boxes.

30:10.066 --> 30:12.533
So it could be a toy,
a musical ornament.

30:12.667 --> 30:13.633
- Right.
- Great.

30:15.567 --> 30:16.367
Then we find the song.

30:16.500 --> 30:18.133
If we find the song,

30:18.266 --> 30:19.200
then we can narrow the search
that way?

30:19.333 --> 30:20.734
You need to talk
to Slide Cunningham.

30:20.867 --> 30:22.166
- Who?
- Who?

30:22.300 --> 30:24.400
He owns the record store
off of Fifth.

30:24.533 --> 30:26.333
Plays poker with your father
on Friday nights.

30:26.467 --> 30:28.500
He knows every song
under the sun.

30:28.633 --> 30:30.300
Of course, he does.

30:30.433 --> 30:31.633
Oh!

30:31.767 --> 30:32.900
They're done.

30:33.033 --> 30:34.100
Josh, go get a couple of aprons.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.233
You two are just in time
to help decorate.

30:36.367 --> 30:37.800
No, no, no, Mom,
we're in a hurry.

30:37.934 --> 30:41.867
We have... some time, yeah?

30:42.000 --> 30:44.900
For every five we decorate,
we do get to eat one.

30:45.033 --> 30:47.300
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.

30:49.033 --> 30:50.166
Don't judge.

30:50.300 --> 30:51.867
Keep comments
to yourselves, please.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.900
- Here's some more googly eyes.
- Oh, thank you.

30:54.033 --> 30:55.867
Sharon, this is
my fourth cookie.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.266
Looking good.

30:57.400 --> 30:58.300
One more!

30:58.433 --> 31:00.567
So have you finished
your Christmas shopping?

31:00.700 --> 31:03.000
Nah. I was gonna get tickets
to that big Christmas concert,

31:03.133 --> 31:04.633
but they sold out in minutes.

31:04.767 --> 31:05.800
- Oh!
- So... mm-hmm.

31:05.934 --> 31:07.367
What about you?

31:07.500 --> 31:08.400
Oh, wait, sorry.

31:08.533 --> 31:10.133
Were you done in...

31:10.266 --> 31:11.433
October?

31:11.567 --> 31:12.633
- No.
- Mm.

31:12.767 --> 31:13.633
No, September.

31:13.767 --> 31:15.033
Oh! September.

31:15.166 --> 31:17.166
The sales start in November.
You like to pay full price, huh?

31:17.300 --> 31:18.900
I like to get it done early.
It's how I roll.

31:19.033 --> 31:20.934
Thank you, by the way,
for indulging my mom.

31:21.066 --> 31:22.467
I appreciate that.

31:22.600 --> 31:25.467
Oh, no, your family is always
so warm and big and...

31:25.600 --> 31:27.800
...just lively
at Christmas.

31:27.934 --> 31:29.033
Yeah, they're all right.

31:29.166 --> 31:30.834
Yeah, it was just me
and my mom for so long--

31:30.967 --> 31:32.033
you know that.

31:33.233 --> 31:34.700
I always looked forward
to spending time here.

31:37.800 --> 31:38.667
Question.

31:38.800 --> 31:39.633
Mm-hmm?

31:39.767 --> 31:40.834
What is that?

31:40.967 --> 31:42.667
Oh, my goodness!
What is that?

31:42.800 --> 31:44.367
Suspenders!

31:44.500 --> 31:45.633
It doesn't have pants.

31:45.767 --> 31:46.734
I'm getting there.

31:46.867 --> 31:49.100
Well, I quite like your... gingerbread...

31:49.233 --> 31:50.467
frog.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.266
That is not a frog.

31:52.400 --> 31:53.667
That is no frog,
that is an elf.

31:53.800 --> 31:55.166
Elf?

31:55.300 --> 31:56.500
Okay.
It maybe looks like a frog.

31:56.633 --> 31:58.367
Truce?

32:02.066 --> 32:03.166
Disgusting.

32:04.133 --> 32:05.367
Wonder what happened

32:05.500 --> 32:07.133
with our mystery man
and Madelyn.

32:07.266 --> 32:08.300
Have you thought about it?

32:08.433 --> 32:10.266
I like to think that
she's the one who got away,

32:10.400 --> 32:12.133
because he sounds like
he really loves her.

32:12.266 --> 32:13.633
Think she'll give him
a second chance?

32:15.500 --> 32:17.200
I hope so.

32:19.166 --> 32:20.233
I like to think,

32:20.367 --> 32:21.700
when you're truly meant
for someone,

32:21.834 --> 32:23.533
it's never too late
to get it right.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.467
You know what I think happened?

32:26.600 --> 32:27.467
Mm-mm.

32:27.600 --> 32:29.300
I think she insulted
his gingerbread elf.

32:30.834 --> 32:33.834
Or she could've complimented
his gingerbread frog.

32:33.967 --> 32:36.567
That's true.
I appreciate that.

32:36.700 --> 32:38.000
Pants!

32:38.133 --> 32:40.734
I don't know if you can
claim that, but it's close.

32:40.867 --> 32:42.066
They're on sale.

32:42.200 --> 32:44.433
In November.

32:44.567 --> 32:46.066
Great. I'll pick 'em up.

33:02.767 --> 33:04.200
- Hey!
- Hi.

33:04.333 --> 33:06.700
Oh! Those look delicious.

33:06.834 --> 33:08.033
Caramel turtles.

33:08.166 --> 33:09.700
Want to go in?

33:09.834 --> 33:12.266
No. Just looking.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.500
Shall we?

33:38.100 --> 33:40.133
Hello. Sorry.

33:40.266 --> 33:41.166
Hey! What can I do for you?

33:41.300 --> 33:42.667
We're actually just
looking for a song.

33:42.800 --> 33:45.233
My mother said you might be
able to help us identify it.

33:45.367 --> 33:46.533
Do you know a Sharon Hart?

33:46.667 --> 33:47.934
Oh! You're Gary's boy?

33:48.066 --> 33:49.467
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we were...

33:49.600 --> 33:51.767
told you're the expert
with these kinds of things.

33:51.900 --> 33:53.700
You know how many people walk
through the door every day,

33:53.834 --> 33:56.100
humming some bridge off-tune,
asking me to name it?

33:56.900 --> 33:58.400
A lot.

33:58.533 --> 34:00.400
And you know how many times
I can name it?

34:01.200 --> 34:02.633
Every time.

34:02.767 --> 34:03.600
Let's hear it.

34:03.734 --> 34:04.934
Yeah.

34:08.900 --> 34:10.000
If there is any chance...

34:12.433 --> 34:14.133
...that you feel the same...

34:17.300 --> 34:18.500
...I'll be at our spot...

34:20.867 --> 34:22.233
...Christmas Eve, 9:00.

34:31.266 --> 34:32.667
I got nothing.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.700
Well, that took a turn.

34:49.033 --> 34:52.166
♪ It must be Christmas again ♪

34:52.300 --> 34:57.367
♪ I look around and see
Those old signs the same ♪

34:57.500 --> 35:00.667
♪ But lights and laughter
They fill the air ♪

35:00.800 --> 35:01.900
Ahem!

35:02.033 --> 35:03.567
Ah.

35:03.700 --> 35:06.800
So, there's
the Festival of Trees,

35:06.934 --> 35:10.000
ice skating
at Seattle Center Winterfest,

35:10.133 --> 35:12.767
and Holiday High Tea
at the Fairmont.

35:12.900 --> 35:13.567
Mm!

35:13.700 --> 35:15.367
I heard
that's very popular.

35:16.400 --> 35:17.533
I did some research
on the plane.

35:17.667 --> 35:20.266
You know, this is
my first time in Seattle.

35:21.967 --> 35:25.000
What's your favorite place
to visit in the city?

35:25.133 --> 35:26.500
Oh, it's been a while.

35:26.633 --> 35:27.734
Actually...

35:27.867 --> 35:29.900
there's something
I want to talk to you about.

35:30.033 --> 35:33.533
The last few months,
they've been really wonderful.

35:33.667 --> 35:35.600
- I hope you feel the same.
- I do.

35:36.734 --> 35:38.800
My brother is hosting
a New Year's party.

35:38.934 --> 35:40.934
My family will all be there.

35:41.066 --> 35:42.533
I'd love for you
to come and meet them.

35:43.333 --> 35:44.367
Meet your family?

35:44.500 --> 35:46.266
Yeah, they've heard
so much about you.

35:47.233 --> 35:48.834
It's the next step.

35:48.967 --> 35:50.967
"The next step."

35:52.066 --> 35:53.767
Ahem.

35:53.900 --> 35:56.467
Just think about it?

35:56.600 --> 35:58.400
Why don't we check out
that tea party?

35:58.533 --> 35:59.433
Great.

35:59.567 --> 36:01.533
I really think
you're going to enjoy it.

36:01.667 --> 36:03.967
- They serve tiny sandwiches.
- Okay.

36:11.667 --> 36:12.600
Hello?

36:12.734 --> 36:15.333
Well, I think it's safe to say
that our song

36:15.467 --> 36:17.467
is not
"Baby, It's Cold Outside".

36:18.567 --> 36:20.400
WZRX has played it four times

36:20.533 --> 36:21.734
in the last two hours.

36:21.867 --> 36:22.700
Well, they've played it

36:22.834 --> 36:24.000
five times on OKQ.

36:25.133 --> 36:26.700
So how's it going?

36:26.834 --> 36:28.333
Any luck on your end?

36:28.467 --> 36:29.967
I was able to clip the portion
of the voicemail

36:30.100 --> 36:33.734
and post it to a few Christmas-
enthusiast message boards.

36:33.867 --> 36:34.900
I like that.

36:35.033 --> 36:36.200
How many are there?

36:36.333 --> 36:37.533
More than you would think!
The consensus is

36:37.667 --> 36:40.333
it's some old, obscure
British song

36:40.467 --> 36:42.266
named
"Holly and the Ivy".

36:42.400 --> 36:43.600
And what do you think?

36:43.734 --> 36:45.633
I am sending you
the file now.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.100
Great. Well done.

36:48.233 --> 36:50.367
All set.

37:04.266 --> 37:05.133
It's too...

37:05.266 --> 37:06.100
Yeah.

37:06.233 --> 37:08.000
- Not quite.
- Nope.

37:09.367 --> 37:11.834
I'm glad
we're on the same page.

37:15.767 --> 37:17.533
So...

37:19.233 --> 37:21.367
...what are you doing tonight?

37:21.500 --> 37:23.834
Uh... this.

37:23.967 --> 37:26.300
Yeah? Yeah,
I think I've hit a brick wall.

37:26.433 --> 37:29.600
I've gone through
a pot of coffee.

37:31.066 --> 37:32.467
Uh, hey, Josh?

37:32.600 --> 37:34.066
Um, someone's here,

37:34.200 --> 37:35.667
so I got to go.

37:35.800 --> 37:36.967
Oh, yeah? Okay.

37:38.266 --> 37:40.133
I'll see you tomorrow?

37:41.300 --> 37:42.667
Tomorrow.

37:51.333 --> 37:52.333
I gotta get back.

37:52.467 --> 37:54.700
I've been here too long.

37:56.800 --> 37:59.367
I gotta go.

38:03.166 --> 38:04.233
Hey, where's Josh?

38:04.367 --> 38:05.367
He left.

38:05.500 --> 38:06.467
- He left?
- Yeah.

38:06.600 --> 38:07.900
He said he needed some air.

38:08.033 --> 38:09.266
When was that?

38:09.400 --> 38:11.567
Five, ten minutes ago?

38:13.834 --> 38:15.433
Okay.

38:15.567 --> 38:17.467
Hey, Josh left.

38:17.600 --> 38:18.934
Can you give you a ride?

38:19.066 --> 38:20.734
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

38:20.867 --> 38:23.533
Don't you think you should
talk to Josh first?

38:23.667 --> 38:25.433
Ah, it'll have to wait.

38:27.233 --> 38:28.500
Oh! It's locked.

38:28.633 --> 38:31.000
I think you should tell him. Tonight.

38:31.133 --> 38:32.166
He's not here.

38:32.300 --> 38:33.633
I know you're nervous,

38:33.767 --> 38:35.266
but if you don't
say something now,

38:35.400 --> 38:36.433
I think you'll regret it.

38:36.567 --> 38:38.567
I'll tell him.
I promise.

38:40.500 --> 38:41.967
Tomorrow.

38:48.400 --> 38:50.533
It's open, Mom.

38:50.667 --> 38:51.433
Hi!

38:51.567 --> 38:52.867
Oh, I'm so glad you are here.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.200
- Oh!
- I want you

38:54.333 --> 38:55.734
to listen
to something for me.

38:55.867 --> 38:57.400
What's all this?

38:57.533 --> 38:58.734
Music boxes?

38:58.867 --> 39:00.767
Oh, I didn't ruin
my Christmas gift, did I?

39:00.900 --> 39:01.667
There's a song

39:01.800 --> 39:03.367
in the background
of the voicemail,

39:03.500 --> 39:04.800
and I can't identify it.

39:04.934 --> 39:07.066
Can you just tell me
if you recognize it?

39:09.133 --> 39:10.333
If there is any chance...

39:12.500 --> 39:14.433
...that you feel the same--

39:14.567 --> 39:16.700
I know it's not much
to go on.

39:16.834 --> 39:18.433
You're still trying
to find that caller?

39:18.567 --> 39:20.300
Well, the hotel clearly
isn't going to help me.

39:20.433 --> 39:21.300
We're his last hope!

39:21.433 --> 39:23.233
Ah, you've always
been so tenacious.

39:23.367 --> 39:24.500
Running around this city,

39:24.633 --> 39:26.467
just tracking every lead
for your paper...

39:26.600 --> 39:28.400
Wait. You said "We're".

39:28.533 --> 39:30.033
"We're his last hope."

39:30.166 --> 39:31.934
Josh is been helping me.

39:32.066 --> 39:33.300
Josh Hart?

39:33.433 --> 39:35.300
Oh, I haven't heard that name
in a while.

39:35.433 --> 39:37.500
Yeah, he's back
for Christmas, so.

39:37.633 --> 39:39.066
Do you think
that's a good idea?

39:43.066 --> 39:44.834
He left.

39:52.066 --> 39:54.200
He moved halfway
around the country,

39:54.333 --> 39:55.400
couldn't pick up the phone.

39:55.533 --> 39:57.734
Honey, I just don't want
to see you get hurt again.

39:57.867 --> 39:59.734
I'm fine!

40:03.867 --> 40:05.066
I promise.

40:07.900 --> 40:09.400
I spoke to Tom Burress today.

40:09.533 --> 40:11.433
He's accepted an offer
with another firm.

40:11.567 --> 40:12.333
He gave his notice.

40:13.667 --> 40:14.734
He's gonna be tough to replace.

40:14.867 --> 40:15.600
Mm.

40:15.734 --> 40:17.633
Do you have
anyone else in mind?

40:17.767 --> 40:19.000
You.

40:20.166 --> 40:21.266
You're ready.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.000
And I would like to make

40:23.133 --> 40:24.233
the official announcement
at the party.

40:25.333 --> 40:27.033
I don't know what to say.

40:27.166 --> 40:29.533
Think about it.

40:34.900 --> 40:36.333
Bye!

41:46.867 --> 41:48.867
Sorry!
I did not mean to interrupt.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.100
I'm just--

41:50.233 --> 41:51.900
No, that's all right,
I forgot the next line anyways.

41:52.033 --> 41:54.633
Is it "Lords a-leapin'"?
"Pipers pipin'"?

41:54.767 --> 41:56.233
"Ladies dancing."

41:56.367 --> 41:59.100
Yeah! "Ladies dancing."
All right.

41:59.233 --> 42:00.633
Aren't you...

42:00.767 --> 42:02.700
aren't you Tenille Townes?

42:02.834 --> 42:05.467
Slide told me a bit
about your dilemma.

42:05.600 --> 42:07.000
You must think
I'm crazy--

42:07.133 --> 42:09.567
running around the city
looking for a stranger.

42:09.700 --> 42:11.900
No! I mean, there's
no such thing as a stranger

42:12.033 --> 42:13.066
at Christmas.

42:14.667 --> 42:16.834
I think what you're doing
is very kind.

42:16.967 --> 42:18.567
We need more of that
in this world.

42:18.700 --> 42:20.367
Here it is.

42:20.500 --> 42:24.033
Blue Notes' Christmas album. 1986.

42:24.166 --> 42:25.166
First pressing!

42:25.300 --> 42:26.600
"The Blue Notes"?

42:26.734 --> 42:27.867
Jazz trio.

42:29.233 --> 42:31.333
Now, the Christmas album
is mostly holiday standards,

42:31.467 --> 42:32.834
but...

42:32.967 --> 42:35.667
the last song
is an original.

42:36.633 --> 42:38.333
"Time for Me to Come Home."

- Yeah?

43:17.000 --> 43:17.767
Hello?

43:17.900 --> 43:19.066
It's a snow globe!

43:19.200 --> 43:21.367
Yeah,
I just got a call from Slide.

43:21.500 --> 43:22.734
- He found the song.
- Huh!

43:22.867 --> 43:24.000
So I did some research,

43:24.133 --> 43:25.233
and McCammon's
department store

43:25.367 --> 43:27.467
puts out a signature snow globe
every Christmas.

43:27.600 --> 43:28.734
Oh, yes.

43:28.867 --> 43:30.500
My mother got one last year.
It had a little dog

43:30.633 --> 43:31.600
on a sled,

43:31.734 --> 43:33.066
and every time
you turned the key,

43:33.200 --> 43:35.066
it played Jimmy Wakely's
"Christmas Polka".

43:35.200 --> 43:37.333
Well,
this year's globe

43:37.467 --> 43:38.433
plays "Time for Me
to Come Home"

43:38.567 --> 43:39.467
by the Blue Notes.

43:39.600 --> 43:41.633
Wow. I can be at McCammon's

43:41.767 --> 43:42.800
in 15 minutes.

43:42.934 --> 43:44.066
Perfect.
Yeah, I'll just meet you there.

43:44.200 --> 43:45.467
All right.

43:52.467 --> 43:54.433
Okay, so I'm a snow globe.
Where would I live?

43:54.567 --> 43:55.633
Housewares?

43:55.767 --> 43:58.033
Maybe?
No, no. Toys. Toys.

43:58.166 --> 43:59.600
Something tells me
it's behind...

43:59.734 --> 44:01.133
these two handsome gentlemen.

44:04.100 --> 44:05.633
Well, to summarize,

44:05.767 --> 44:06.800
we're looking
for a man who purchased

44:06.934 --> 44:08.667
your amazing snow globe
on Monday.

44:08.800 --> 44:10.100
Sometime before 11 a.m.

44:10.233 --> 44:12.300
And he might've had
from "Sweeteats Candy" bag

44:12.433 --> 44:15.600
and might have been shopping
for a woman named Madelyn.

44:15.734 --> 44:17.834
I'm sorry,
I know this is a long shot.

44:17.967 --> 44:19.033
Did you say "Madelyn"?

44:20.200 --> 44:23.066
There was one customer.
He was about your height.

44:23.200 --> 44:24.800
Had a beard.

44:24.934 --> 44:26.133
Mentioned shopping
for a Madelyn.

44:26.266 --> 44:27.200
Really?

44:27.333 --> 44:29.967
I suggested a snow globe.
Very popular.

44:30.100 --> 44:31.200
And wouldn't you know,
he said

44:31.333 --> 44:33.100
they had their first date
in that gazebo?

44:33.233 --> 44:34.567
Did he tell you anything else?

44:34.700 --> 44:36.867
Just that she was
in the city for work

44:37.000 --> 44:38.166
and he was hoping to connect.

44:38.300 --> 44:39.834
He didn't want to show up
empty-handed.

44:39.967 --> 44:41.633
Okay, did he happen
to say his name?

44:41.767 --> 44:43.266
No.

44:44.600 --> 44:45.600
Did he pay by credit card?

44:45.734 --> 44:46.533
Cash.

44:47.834 --> 44:49.200
How did you say
you knew him again?

44:50.367 --> 44:52.066
He left something with us.

44:52.200 --> 44:53.934
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, we're trying to return it.

44:54.066 --> 44:55.166
Well, if you leave
your number,

44:55.300 --> 44:56.767
I can let you know
if he comes back in.

44:57.533 --> 44:58.400
Yeah.

44:58.533 --> 45:00.500
Thank you.

45:03.100 --> 45:04.867
Have a good one. Bye.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.767
All right, you ready?

45:06.900 --> 45:08.200
Moment of truth.

45:09.133 --> 45:12.000
One shake for good luck.

45:17.900 --> 45:20.300
Yeah.
I think this is it.

45:20.433 --> 45:21.767
I knew it.

45:23.834 --> 45:25.767
Yeah, I think that's it.

45:25.900 --> 45:27.333
I think that's it.

45:30.567 --> 45:32.333
Honey, you found your song!

45:34.367 --> 45:35.133
Ms. Athens.

45:35.266 --> 45:36.500
Mom!

45:36.633 --> 45:37.600
It's so good to see you.

45:38.767 --> 45:40.567
I'm so sorry
it's been so long.

45:40.700 --> 45:42.266
Merry Christmas!

45:42.400 --> 45:43.567
Merry Christmas.

45:43.700 --> 45:45.166
We got a lucky break.

45:45.300 --> 45:47.600
Oh, I don't think
it would be a lucky break.

45:47.734 --> 45:49.333
Um, a music shop owner

45:49.467 --> 45:52.500
recognized the song
from an old out-of-print LP,

45:52.633 --> 45:54.166
and Elizabeth managed
to trace it

45:54.300 --> 45:57.433
to this particular snow globe
in this particular store.

45:57.567 --> 45:58.900
So now what's next?

45:59.033 --> 46:00.734
Well, we know
he was here Monday morning.

46:00.867 --> 46:03.000
Uh, we have to see
if anyone remembers him.

46:03.133 --> 46:04.333
Oh, you know what,
if they left a paper trail?

46:04.467 --> 46:05.433
Yeah.

46:06.667 --> 46:07.700
Okay. Well, best of luck.

46:07.834 --> 46:09.100
Don't need luck.
Got Lizzie.

46:09.233 --> 46:10.166
Ah!

46:15.467 --> 46:16.667
He might go back.

46:16.800 --> 46:17.867
We shouldn't rule it out.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.300
I know, I can't just wait
and do nothing, though.

46:20.433 --> 46:21.600
It is odd.

46:21.734 --> 46:22.633
What is?

46:22.767 --> 46:24.000
In his message--

46:24.133 --> 46:25.834
he said that Madelyn was gonna
be busy at the holidays,

46:25.967 --> 46:27.400
and that's usually
friends and family.

46:27.533 --> 46:29.166
but he never mentioned work.

46:29.300 --> 46:30.233
True.

46:30.367 --> 46:32.200
I just-- I think there's
some angle we're missing.

46:33.333 --> 46:35.667
What?

46:35.800 --> 46:37.066
Nothing.

46:37.200 --> 46:39.133
Tell me.

46:40.433 --> 46:42.200
It just feels
a little like old times.

46:42.333 --> 46:45.400
You and me,
on some wild-goose chase.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.400
I always thought
you blamed me...

46:53.533 --> 46:54.600
...for the accident.

46:54.734 --> 46:56.133
You?

46:56.266 --> 46:58.033
How?

46:58.166 --> 47:01.300
I talked the both of you into
going to that party that night.

47:01.433 --> 47:02.834
I wasn't there

47:02.967 --> 47:05.433
when I promised
that I'd get you home.

47:06.333 --> 47:08.567
Where did you go that night?

47:09.734 --> 47:11.533
Did something happen or...?

47:15.033 --> 47:16.467
Lizzie...

47:18.400 --> 47:21.100
Look.

47:21.233 --> 47:22.333
The voicemail said,

47:22.467 --> 47:24.166
"I know you're probably busy
with the holidays."

47:24.300 --> 47:27.033
What if he didn't say
"holidays"?

47:28.567 --> 47:30.500
"Halliday's."

47:30.633 --> 47:32.333
He meant the Christmas Market?

47:32.467 --> 47:34.600
Yeah, maybe she worked
at one of the booths?

47:34.734 --> 47:35.900
How long is it open?

47:36.033 --> 47:37.233
Till tomorrow night--

47:37.367 --> 47:38.400
Christmas Eve.

47:39.500 --> 47:41.467
Come on.

47:48.934 --> 47:50.066
or Santa's photo booth.

47:50.200 --> 47:51.266
Well, photo booth--
west or east?

47:51.400 --> 47:52.700
'Cause there's one at each exit.

47:52.834 --> 47:54.533
- Really?
- Yeah.

47:54.667 --> 47:55.700
How big is this market?

47:55.834 --> 47:56.633
Step right up!

47:56.767 --> 47:58.100
Test your skill!

47:58.233 --> 47:59.934
You, with the blue coat.

48:00.133 --> 48:01.633
- That's you.
- Oh, uh...

48:01.767 --> 48:03.133
N-No, thank you.

48:03.266 --> 48:04.333
Three rings to win.

48:04.467 --> 48:06.100
Come on!
Win a prize for your girlfriend.

48:06.233 --> 48:08.033
- Oh, no--
- Oh! Please, no! No.

48:08.166 --> 48:09.900
I would be more likely
to win one for him.

48:10.033 --> 48:11.100
Oh!

48:11.233 --> 48:12.133
Say that a little bit louder.

48:12.266 --> 48:14.300
Don't think
they heard you in the back.

48:14.433 --> 48:16.800
Come on. You're not
the most coordinated person.

48:16.934 --> 48:19.133
Tell me how you really feel.

48:19.266 --> 48:20.734
That a challenge?

48:20.867 --> 48:24.467
No, a challenge would be
if I spotted you two rings.

48:24.600 --> 48:25.800
You're on.

48:25.934 --> 48:27.333
We're on!

48:27.467 --> 48:30.834
I like your spirit.

48:30.967 --> 48:31.867
There you go.

48:32.000 --> 48:32.834
- Thank you.
- Please--

48:32.967 --> 48:34.233
ladies first.

48:34.367 --> 48:35.734
Oh?

48:37.700 --> 48:38.633
Oh!

48:38.767 --> 48:40.700
Yes! One.

48:40.834 --> 48:41.900
Looked pretty easy.

48:42.033 --> 48:42.900
Here we go.

48:44.867 --> 48:45.633
Not bad.

48:45.767 --> 48:46.700
One - one.

48:46.834 --> 48:47.734
It's a, uh, wrist-elbow action.

48:47.867 --> 48:49.367
Don't injure yourself.

48:53.066 --> 48:54.633
Thank you.

48:55.934 --> 48:56.900
No pressure.

48:57.033 --> 48:58.166
Thanks.

49:03.400 --> 49:04.867
Looks like we're all tied up.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.100
Nervous?

49:06.233 --> 49:07.700
Should we bet?

49:07.834 --> 49:08.667
What's the bet?

49:08.800 --> 49:11.433
I win, you have to buy me
a hot chocolate.

49:11.567 --> 49:12.734
What if I win?

49:12.867 --> 49:15.367
Name your prize.

49:15.500 --> 49:17.433
You got to come
to my parents' Christmas party.

49:17.567 --> 49:18.867
Tonight.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.133
You're on.

49:21.266 --> 49:23.367
Please, allow me.

49:27.266 --> 49:30.233
Thank you. Thank you.

49:32.467 --> 49:34.467
Ahem.

49:44.700 --> 49:46.600
Okay.

49:48.200 --> 49:50.900
What time?

49:52.967 --> 49:54.500
There you go.

49:54.633 --> 49:55.834
Thank you.

49:55.967 --> 49:57.567
Here.

49:57.700 --> 49:59.433
Oh! No, sir.
That is your prize.

49:59.567 --> 50:01.100
I was hoping you'd say that.

50:01.233 --> 50:02.200
Thank you.

50:02.333 --> 50:03.734
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

50:05.567 --> 50:07.967
Hi. Do you know a Madelyn?

50:08.100 --> 50:09.800
No, I'm afraid not.

50:09.934 --> 50:11.867
Oh. Or a, like, Maddy, even?

50:12.000 --> 50:13.800
Sorry, I don't know her.

50:13.934 --> 50:15.600
Madelyn?
Sure. She works here.

50:15.734 --> 50:16.734
She's off today,

50:16.867 --> 50:19.066
but if you come back tomorrow,
she'll be around.

50:19.200 --> 50:20.667
Okay. Thank you. We will.

50:20.800 --> 50:22.600
- Did we find her?
- Maybe. We don't know for sure.

50:22.734 --> 50:24.400
No, no, no, we got
a good feeling about this.

50:24.533 --> 50:25.400
I do, too!

50:26.433 --> 50:28.200
Oh, thank you.
For everything.

50:28.333 --> 50:30.300
Seriously, I would not be here
without you.

50:30.433 --> 50:32.500
Josh!
What are you two doing here?

50:32.633 --> 50:33.900
Oh, we're just catching up.

50:34.033 --> 50:35.900
Did he tell you
about his new house?

50:36.033 --> 50:37.800
You bought a house?

50:37.934 --> 50:39.166
But... in Michigan?

50:41.667 --> 50:42.834
I'm about to, yeah.

50:42.967 --> 50:44.767
Ah.

50:46.433 --> 50:49.266
We're taking the little guy
for his first photo with Santa.

50:49.400 --> 50:52.100
You guys should come.
We're going to sneak in a few.

50:52.233 --> 50:55.367
Just like you did
when you were little, remember?

50:55.500 --> 50:58.333
No, no, Ma.
I think we're-- we're okay.

50:58.467 --> 50:59.800
Oh, come on.
It'll be fun.

50:59.934 --> 51:00.834
Yeah.

51:00.967 --> 51:02.300
We're bringing the bear.
Let's go.

51:02.433 --> 51:03.734
- Let's go! Santa.
- It's a celebration.

51:03.867 --> 51:05.233
Family photo time!

51:07.767 --> 51:10.000
Josh! Josh.

51:14.800 --> 51:16.033
Any word yet?

51:16.166 --> 51:17.600
No, not yet.

51:17.734 --> 51:20.567
But, uh, I didn't tell her
to call me or text me.

51:20.700 --> 51:21.967
I said "Let's meet

51:22.100 --> 51:23.667
at our usual spot,
Christmas Eve."

51:23.800 --> 51:26.033
Madelyn came to see me.

51:26.166 --> 51:27.433
After you left?

51:27.567 --> 51:31.033
Said you'd stopped
answering her phone calls.

51:31.166 --> 51:32.934
Hoped you might've
picked up mine.

51:33.066 --> 51:34.233
I-- I'm sorry.

51:34.367 --> 51:38.166
I couldn't let anyone...
see me.

51:38.300 --> 51:39.567
I felt so ashamed.

51:39.700 --> 51:41.533
Nothing wrong with asking
for a little help.

51:41.667 --> 51:43.400
I know that now.

51:43.533 --> 51:45.667
And I'm, um, seeing someone...

51:45.800 --> 51:46.900
a counselor.

51:48.066 --> 51:49.967
Been doing the work.

51:50.100 --> 51:51.133
And I gotta tell you, Pete,

51:51.266 --> 51:53.600
for the first time
in a long time,

51:53.734 --> 51:55.266
it feels like my head
is above water.

51:55.400 --> 51:57.433
This is great to hear.

51:57.567 --> 51:59.567
However,
you should prepare yourself

51:59.700 --> 52:01.533
for the possibility
that she's moved on.

52:03.200 --> 52:05.100
I've tried to leave her
in the past.

52:05.233 --> 52:07.967
But no matter how much time
goes by...

52:08.100 --> 52:11.900
my thoughts
always go back to her.

52:13.600 --> 52:15.500
She's the love of my life, Pete.

52:16.500 --> 52:19.100
And I gotta try
to make this right.

52:19.233 --> 52:20.867
It's been three years.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.734
You can't expect her to wait.

52:22.867 --> 52:24.300
I know.

52:24.433 --> 52:27.100
Hey.
Come to Asheville with me.

52:27.233 --> 52:28.200
Spend Christmas
with family.

52:28.333 --> 52:29.500
Can't.

52:29.633 --> 52:31.934
I've already talked to Nancy.
There's plenty of room.

52:32.066 --> 52:33.200
We'd all love to have you.

52:33.333 --> 52:34.600
That's very kind, but...

52:34.734 --> 52:37.000
I know you're hoping
things work out.

52:37.133 --> 52:38.867
What if it doesn't?

52:40.967 --> 52:43.333
Don't stick around this city
just to get your heart broken.

52:47.700 --> 52:49.066
I'm okay.

52:49.200 --> 52:50.700
Really?

52:51.967 --> 52:52.934
Yep.

52:53.066 --> 52:54.934
I've been to all our old spots.

52:55.066 --> 52:57.033
I got her this snow globe

52:57.166 --> 52:59.700
with a gazebo
and a cupola in it.

52:59.834 --> 53:00.967
The gazebo?

53:01.100 --> 53:02.633
Like, the gazebo.

53:02.767 --> 53:06.367
I just... just gotta see her.
Gotta talk to her.

53:09.367 --> 53:11.200
Is that everything?

53:11.333 --> 53:12.266
It should be.
Where's Troy?

53:12.400 --> 53:14.333
He's meeting us at the site.

53:14.467 --> 53:15.600
Think we have time
for lunch?

53:15.734 --> 53:18.233
Oh, we can get
something there.

53:18.367 --> 53:20.500
Do you believe in fate?

53:21.300 --> 53:22.667
Fate?

53:22.800 --> 53:25.233
That certain things
are meant to be?

53:25.367 --> 53:26.967
Wh-- Where is this coming from?

53:28.433 --> 53:31.266
I feel like I've been getting
these signs from the universe.

53:31.400 --> 53:33.000
It got me thinking.

53:33.133 --> 53:36.233
If some things that happen
were always meant to happen...

53:36.367 --> 53:38.667
then the things
that don't work out

53:38.800 --> 53:41.133
were never meant to.
Right?

53:41.266 --> 53:42.734
I don't believe in signs.

53:42.867 --> 53:46.100
I think we notice things
because they're important to us,

53:46.233 --> 53:47.400
because they're on our mind.

53:48.734 --> 53:51.467
So, what's been on your mind?

53:55.300 --> 53:58.066
Well...

54:01.300 --> 54:02.233
Okay, so she works
at Halliday's?

54:02.367 --> 54:03.533
- Yeah, possibly.
- Yeah, we're going back

54:03.667 --> 54:05.734
tomorrow to play her the message
at the Christmas Market.

54:05.867 --> 54:07.567
I wonder what happened
to drive them apart?

54:07.700 --> 54:08.967
Maybe he chose
the wrong woman

54:09.100 --> 54:10.133
and always regretted it?

54:10.266 --> 54:11.734
I wouldn't take him back.

54:11.867 --> 54:14.266
We don't know
what happened for sure.

54:14.400 --> 54:15.400
I think it's romantic--

54:15.533 --> 54:18.200
one last grand gesture
to the one who got away.

54:18.333 --> 54:19.467
Mm-hmm!

54:19.600 --> 54:20.800
And the voicemail
ended up with you?

54:20.934 --> 54:22.867
Like a message in a bottle.

54:23.000 --> 54:23.834
But why your number?

54:23.967 --> 54:26.700
I guess Madelyn's and I's
must be similar,

54:26.834 --> 54:28.767
and he probably got
a digit off.

54:28.900 --> 54:30.800
Well, they got
the right wrong number.

54:30.934 --> 54:32.867
Most people would have
simply deleted it.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.066
I just can't believe
you found her,

54:34.200 --> 54:36.867
with so little to go on
in a 20-second voicemail.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.600
- I can.
- I can, too.

54:38.734 --> 54:41.033
These two were quite the team
back in the day.

54:43.233 --> 54:44.300
Thank you, Mom.

54:59.900 --> 55:02.133
There you are.

55:03.400 --> 55:04.300
You all right?

55:04.433 --> 55:05.567
Yeah.

55:07.066 --> 55:09.333
I was just thinking about
the last time we were out here.

55:09.467 --> 55:13.100
Andy made us
make that Christmas wish.

55:13.233 --> 55:14.567
Yeah.

55:14.700 --> 55:16.467
I think about
that Christmas a lot.

55:16.600 --> 55:18.633
Just...

55:18.767 --> 55:20.000
there's a lot of things

55:20.133 --> 55:22.033
I wish I would've
really done differently.

55:23.567 --> 55:24.900
Things I wish I'd told him.

55:26.000 --> 55:29.533
He would've loved
our voicemail mystery.

55:29.667 --> 55:31.867
Yeah, he would've guessed
that song on the first listen.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.600
And he would've rubbed it
in our faces, too.

55:33.734 --> 55:35.066
Oh, we would've never
heard the end of it.

55:35.200 --> 55:36.734
Never.

55:40.400 --> 55:43.233
I miss him.

55:43.367 --> 55:45.467
I miss him, too.

55:45.600 --> 55:48.600
Sometimes, I think that, um...

55:50.433 --> 55:52.367
...I just had
this whole other life,

55:52.500 --> 55:54.166
just waiting for me,

55:54.300 --> 55:55.633
and just that one night just...

55:55.767 --> 55:58.066
just pushed it off-course.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.133
This is for you.

56:14.934 --> 56:17.633
I thought
you might like a copy.

56:23.633 --> 56:24.867
- Oh.
- All right.

56:25.000 --> 56:26.633
I'm gonna take Elizabeth home.
I'll be back in a bit.

56:26.767 --> 56:28.467
- You bet.
- Okay. You ready to go?

56:28.600 --> 56:30.066
Oh, no. It's all right.

56:30.200 --> 56:31.433
No. I called a cab.

56:31.567 --> 56:32.767
Are you sure?

56:32.900 --> 56:34.133
Mm-hmm.

56:35.367 --> 56:37.233
Thank you. Goodnight.

56:40.500 --> 56:43.000
I had a really wonderful time.

56:43.133 --> 56:44.934
So...

56:51.000 --> 56:52.600
So...

56:52.734 --> 56:54.433
you and Elizabeth
have been spending

56:54.567 --> 56:55.633
a lot of time together.

56:55.767 --> 56:56.800
Yeah, she needed my help.

56:56.934 --> 56:59.767
Oh. Okay.
That's all this was?

56:59.900 --> 57:00.867
A favor.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.133
I feel like
you're gonna tell me

57:02.266 --> 57:03.266
what you think this is.

57:03.400 --> 57:05.533
You miss her.
Tell her, Josh.

57:05.667 --> 57:08.133
This could be
your second chance.

57:16.033 --> 57:18.700
So... you think
she'll give him a second chance?

57:18.834 --> 57:21.467
Yeah, why wouldn't she?

57:21.600 --> 57:23.300
People move on.

57:23.433 --> 57:24.867
Don't want
to reopen old wounds.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.700
Even if it means
losing the love of your life?

57:27.834 --> 57:29.367
No, I hope
she at least hears him out.

57:29.500 --> 57:32.867
I would want to know exactly
where I stand with someone.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.600
Even if it changed
the way you felt about them?

57:35.734 --> 57:38.300
You can't have
a relationship without honesty,

57:38.433 --> 57:39.867
even if it's hard to hear.

57:42.367 --> 57:45.000
Lizzie?

57:46.033 --> 57:48.133
I haven't been honest with you.

57:48.266 --> 57:50.734
What do you mean?

57:51.734 --> 57:53.467
I heard you and Andy
that night...

57:53.600 --> 57:55.367
at the party.

57:56.533 --> 57:58.066
Heard us...?

57:58.200 --> 58:00.300
Talking. In the den.

58:03.500 --> 58:04.567
Oh...

58:04.700 --> 58:06.867
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to, uh... eavesdrop--

58:07.000 --> 58:08.734
I was looking for you.

58:08.867 --> 58:12.133
How much did you hear?

58:12.266 --> 58:14.700
All of it.

58:14.834 --> 58:16.834
Is that why you left?

58:18.066 --> 58:20.200
I just didn't know
what to say to you.

58:22.367 --> 58:24.233
I just needed time to think.

58:28.400 --> 58:29.567
Oh, no!

58:29.700 --> 58:31.934
I thought the market
ran until five.

58:33.967 --> 58:36.500
Oh, uh, I think there's
maybe a storm coming.

58:36.633 --> 58:37.467
Maybe
they're shutting down early.

58:37.600 --> 58:39.200
- Is everyone gone?
- I don't know.

58:39.333 --> 58:40.500
Come on. Let's go.

58:40.633 --> 58:42.600
- Yeah. Let's go, let's go.
- Hey. Hey!

58:42.734 --> 58:45.467
Oh, I'm sorry, we've put
all our merchandise away.

58:45.600 --> 58:47.567
No, no! We're just looking
for Madelyn. I-Is she here?

58:47.700 --> 58:49.100
She just left.

58:50.233 --> 58:52.233
Well, how long ago?

58:53.367 --> 58:55.800
Just a minute.
Let me see if I can catch her.

58:55.934 --> 58:57.700
- Please. Thank you.
- Thank you.

58:57.834 --> 59:00.667
Madelyn? Madelyn!

59:00.800 --> 59:03.100
Someone's here to see you!

59:04.900 --> 59:06.633
I'll be at our spot...

59:06.767 --> 59:09.166
on Christmas Eve, 9:00.

59:09.300 --> 59:11.734
I hope to see you there,
but if...

59:11.867 --> 59:13.233
if I don't,

59:13.367 --> 59:15.200
I understand.

59:18.934 --> 59:21.000
I don't think I'm the person
you're looking for.

59:22.400 --> 59:23.633
But-- really?

59:25.266 --> 59:26.633
Are you sure?

59:26.767 --> 59:29.400
That message isn't for me.
I'm sorry.

59:33.100 --> 59:34.800
It's Christmas Eve!
That was our best shot.

59:34.934 --> 59:36.233
Maybe there's
something we missed.

59:36.367 --> 59:39.800
Josh, it's too late!
There's nothing...

59:39.934 --> 59:42.800
I'm sorry about earlier.
I shouldn't have said anything.

59:44.300 --> 59:46.800
I just didn't want you
to find out that way.

59:47.834 --> 59:49.200
Do you still feel the same?

59:52.467 --> 59:53.734
I do.

59:55.700 --> 59:57.333
These past few days
made me realize it,

59:57.467 --> 59:59.000
so, yeah.

59:59.133 --> 1:00:01.533
- You can't help who you love.
- No, you can't!

1:00:05.500 --> 1:00:07.400
Yeah.

1:00:07.533 --> 1:00:09.600
I want to tell you, that, uh...

1:00:09.734 --> 1:00:12.967
the last few days...

1:00:13.100 --> 1:00:15.066
have been great for me.

1:00:15.200 --> 1:00:18.900
I'm very happy
to have my friend back.

1:00:19.033 --> 1:00:20.967
When I go back to Michigan,

1:00:21.100 --> 1:00:22.233
I hope we stay in touch,

1:00:22.367 --> 1:00:23.233
please.

1:00:26.834 --> 1:00:29.467
Right--
Yeah, okay-- Oh.

1:00:29.600 --> 1:00:32.233
You are going back, so... yeah.

1:00:32.367 --> 1:00:34.900
It's finally starting
to feel like home.

1:00:39.533 --> 1:00:41.300
I'm happy for you.

1:00:42.867 --> 1:00:45.266
Okay, better, uh...

1:00:46.100 --> 1:00:47.133
I guess I should get going.

1:00:47.266 --> 1:00:48.233
I'm supposed to
meet Charlotte soon, so...

1:00:48.367 --> 1:00:49.367
Yup.

1:00:57.033 --> 1:00:58.967
If I don't see you...

1:01:00.800 --> 1:01:02.133
Merry Christmas.

1:01:02.266 --> 1:01:03.633
Merry Christmas.

1:01:03.767 --> 1:01:05.533
Yeah.

We're Madelyn Hawn
and the Holidays.

1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.633
We'll be opening for
the Christmas concert tonight.

1:02:06.767 --> 1:02:08.166
Be sure to get your tickets,

1:02:08.300 --> 1:02:10.333
and have a very Merry Christmas.

1:02:17.734 --> 1:02:18.934
Thanks.

1:02:20.667 --> 1:02:21.600
Hey.

1:02:21.734 --> 1:02:22.600
Hey, you were wonderful.

1:02:25.300 --> 1:02:26.333
Thanks.

1:02:30.100 --> 1:02:32.200
I'm sorry, I need to, um...

1:02:40.033 --> 1:02:42.834
Are you okay?

1:02:42.967 --> 1:02:45.200
I thought I saw
someone I knew.

1:02:47.400 --> 1:02:48.734
Um, I was going
to get you flowers,

1:02:48.867 --> 1:02:49.900
but I remembered

1:02:50.033 --> 1:02:51.333
how you looked at these
in the window.

1:02:51.467 --> 1:02:53.266
Caramel turtles?

1:02:53.400 --> 1:02:57.367
Oh! I thought it was
the peppermint truffles.

1:02:57.500 --> 1:02:59.000
Thank you.

1:03:31.300 --> 1:03:32.600
Seems like your head's
been somewhere else

1:03:32.734 --> 1:03:33.967
the last couple days.

1:03:34.100 --> 1:03:36.367
It's not going to work, is it?

1:03:40.133 --> 1:03:41.600
I'm sorry.

1:03:43.266 --> 1:03:44.633
Is there someone else?

1:03:46.767 --> 1:03:49.333
A memory.

1:03:49.467 --> 1:03:51.767
Those can be real hard
to let go of.

1:03:51.900 --> 1:03:52.867
They are.

1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.000
It's silly, really.

1:03:55.133 --> 1:03:57.266
It's been years.

1:03:57.400 --> 1:03:59.467
He probably doesn't even
think of me...

1:04:03.433 --> 1:04:04.934
You deserve to be happy, Madelyn,

1:04:05.066 --> 1:04:06.266
you really do.

1:04:21.166 --> 1:04:22.300
Hey, Pete.

1:04:22.433 --> 1:04:24.166
Listen, I've been
looking into flights.

1:04:24.300 --> 1:04:26.033
I think I'm gonna
take you up on that offer

1:04:26.166 --> 1:04:27.700
and join you and the family
for Christmas.

1:04:27.834 --> 1:04:28.633
What happened?

1:04:28.767 --> 1:04:30.100
I saw her.

1:04:30.233 --> 1:04:32.800
I'm sorry, Carter.

1:04:32.934 --> 1:04:34.000
I'm not.

1:04:34.133 --> 1:04:35.734
She looked...

1:04:38.066 --> 1:04:39.333
...really happy.

1:04:40.834 --> 1:04:41.867
I'll see you soon, brother.

1:04:42.967 --> 1:04:44.700
Yeah, you bet.

1:04:46.667 --> 1:04:49.066
♪ Christmas Eve ♪

1:04:49.200 --> 1:04:51.233

So,

1:05:07.400 --> 1:05:08.734
you're just going to let her
walk out of your life,

1:05:08.867 --> 1:05:10.567
again?

1:05:11.467 --> 1:05:13.467
What am I supposed to do?

1:05:13.600 --> 1:05:14.900
Say something.

1:05:15.033 --> 1:05:17.233
I did.

1:05:18.066 --> 1:05:20.000
Or I tried to.

1:05:20.133 --> 1:05:21.333
For a moment there,

1:05:21.467 --> 1:05:24.500
I really thought that maybe
she felt the same,

1:05:24.633 --> 1:05:25.266
but I gotta stop.

1:05:25.400 --> 1:05:27.800
I gotta stop and just...

1:05:27.934 --> 1:05:29.233
be her friend,

1:05:29.367 --> 1:05:32.200
like I should have
a long time ago.

1:05:32.333 --> 1:05:33.967
I think it's time
I let this dream die.

1:05:38.166 --> 1:05:39.800
I'm sorry, Josh.

1:05:43.133 --> 1:05:45.200
Yeah.

1:05:46.166 --> 1:05:47.367
Me too.

1:05:52.033 --> 1:05:54.133
Well...

1:05:54.266 --> 1:05:55.800
I'm going to get
another beverage.

1:05:56.967 --> 1:05:58.500
You good?

1:06:00.767 --> 1:06:02.700
I will have a, uh...

1:06:06.333 --> 1:06:07.800
...a water.

1:06:35.867 --> 1:06:36.800
Hey.

1:06:38.200 --> 1:06:39.166
Oh!

1:06:39.300 --> 1:06:40.700
Wow.

1:06:40.834 --> 1:06:41.767
You were right.

1:06:41.900 --> 1:06:43.400
The green's a better choice.

1:06:43.533 --> 1:06:44.333
Mm.

1:06:44.467 --> 1:06:45.467
So, I've been meaning
to ask you.

1:06:45.600 --> 1:06:47.333
What happened
with your mystery caller?

1:06:47.467 --> 1:06:49.500
Just turned out to be
a fool's errand.

1:06:49.633 --> 1:06:51.500
Ah, I see.

1:06:52.834 --> 1:06:55.600
Look, I know you were
expecting a decision

1:06:55.734 --> 1:06:56.567
from me tonight.

1:06:56.700 --> 1:06:58.033
Um...

1:06:58.166 --> 1:06:59.800
I just need
a little more time.

1:06:59.934 --> 1:07:00.967
I'm just...

1:07:02.734 --> 1:07:04.133
You know,

1:07:04.266 --> 1:07:05.867
when you came to me

1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:09.500
to tell me that you had decided
to join me at the company,

1:07:09.633 --> 1:07:11.800
I knew that it was
what you needed at the time,

1:07:11.934 --> 1:07:15.900
just a soft place to land,

1:07:16.033 --> 1:07:18.600
for a little while.

1:07:19.734 --> 1:07:23.567
It was so nice
to have you here,

1:07:23.700 --> 1:07:25.500
beside me,

1:07:25.633 --> 1:07:28.266
and I guess
I was a little selfish

1:07:28.400 --> 1:07:30.700
just... just wanting
to hold onto that.

1:07:32.600 --> 1:07:33.834
These last few days,

1:07:33.967 --> 1:07:38.367
I've seen a side of you
I haven't seen in years.

1:07:38.500 --> 1:07:41.667
Why are you telling me this?

1:07:41.800 --> 1:07:44.467
Because...

1:07:46.633 --> 1:07:48.467
...you have a message
at the front desk.

1:07:51.700 --> 1:07:53.066
Go.

1:07:57.900 --> 1:07:59.467
Go.

1:08:14.667 --> 1:08:16.567
What are you doing here?

1:08:18.233 --> 1:08:19.300
You look beautiful.

1:08:19.433 --> 1:08:21.600
I found her.

1:08:22.433 --> 1:08:23.233
What?

1:08:23.367 --> 1:08:24.934
How?

1:08:25.066 --> 1:08:26.567
She's in a band.

1:08:26.700 --> 1:08:29.166
Madelyn Hawn and the Holidays.

1:08:29.300 --> 1:08:30.200
Are you sure it's her?

1:08:30.333 --> 1:08:31.266
Yes.

1:08:31.400 --> 1:08:32.400
It all adds up.

1:08:32.533 --> 1:08:33.233
In the city for work.

1:08:33.367 --> 1:08:34.500
The Holidays.

1:08:35.767 --> 1:08:38.967
She's the opening act
for the big Christmas concert.

1:08:39.100 --> 1:08:40.233
That's tonight.

1:08:40.367 --> 1:08:41.533
I know.

1:08:43.367 --> 1:08:44.100
I got a cab waiting.

1:08:51.934 --> 1:08:53.467
Come on.

1:09:01.700 --> 1:09:03.800
Yeah, they won't let us in
without a ticket.

1:09:03.934 --> 1:09:05.567
Well, there's got to be
another way.

1:09:07.233 --> 1:09:08.033
- We sneaking in?
- Yup.

1:09:08.166 --> 1:09:09.734
Yup.

1:09:10.934 --> 1:09:12.133
But how are we
going to find her?

1:09:12.266 --> 1:09:13.900
I don't know.

1:09:14.033 --> 1:09:15.233
Act more natural.

1:09:16.734 --> 1:09:19.100
Excuse me,
we're looking for Madelyn.

1:09:21.200 --> 1:09:23.200
Okay. Thank you.

1:09:23.333 --> 1:09:24.166
Appreciate that.

1:09:24.300 --> 1:09:25.200
Very natural.

1:09:25.333 --> 1:09:26.400
I'm trying--

1:09:26.533 --> 1:09:27.967
Hey, she could be
in one of these rooms.

1:09:28.100 --> 1:09:29.000
Yeah, I think you're right--

1:09:29.133 --> 1:09:31.166
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:09:31.300 --> 1:09:32.734
Where are your passes?

1:09:32.867 --> 1:09:34.166
Oh, we had--

1:09:34.300 --> 1:09:35.867
So, they were here a minute ago

1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:37.000
That's so weird.

1:09:37.133 --> 1:09:37.934
Where did they go?

1:09:38.066 --> 1:09:39.500
You know what,
I bet they're back here.

1:09:39.633 --> 1:09:41.066
Let's go, let's go grab 'em.

1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:42.934
I need you both
to come with me.

1:09:43.066 --> 1:09:46.900
We need to talk
to, um, Madelyn Hawn.

1:09:47.033 --> 1:09:48.266
We have something
that belongs to her.

1:09:48.400 --> 1:09:49.667
Please, it's very important
we deliver this.

1:09:49.800 --> 1:09:51.333
She's down the hall.

1:09:51.467 --> 1:09:52.433
Last door.

1:09:52.567 --> 1:09:53.667
They don't have passes.

1:09:53.800 --> 1:09:54.900
Well then
you better show 'em the way.

1:09:55.033 --> 1:09:56.066
Merry Christmas.

1:09:56.200 --> 1:09:57.600
Thank you.

1:09:58.500 --> 1:09:59.433
Yeah.

1:09:59.567 --> 1:10:00.934
What she said.

1:10:03.333 --> 1:10:04.133
Thank you.

1:10:04.266 --> 1:10:05.100
Finally.

1:10:07.367 --> 1:10:08.900
- Ms. Hawn?
- Come in!

1:10:09.033 --> 1:10:11.133
You have visitors.

1:10:12.300 --> 1:10:13.467
Madelyn?

1:10:14.834 --> 1:10:16.533
Hi, um...

1:10:16.667 --> 1:10:18.400
My name is Elizabeth.

1:10:18.533 --> 1:10:19.667
I'm Josh.

1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.400
You don't know us,

1:10:23.533 --> 1:10:24.533
but we have spent
the last three days

1:10:24.667 --> 1:10:26.200
running around this city
trying to find you.

1:10:27.266 --> 1:10:29.200
Why?

1:10:30.834 --> 1:10:33.000
We have a message for you.

1:10:33.133 --> 1:10:34.800
Oh.

1:10:34.934 --> 1:10:38.100
Hey, Madelyn, it's me.

1:10:38.233 --> 1:10:40.600
Been a minute, huh?

1:10:40.734 --> 1:10:43.200
I-I got your new number,
and I wanted to call you,

1:10:43.333 --> 1:10:45.300
I hope that's okay.

1:10:45.433 --> 1:10:47.200
I'm sure you're surprised
to hear from me,

1:10:47.333 --> 1:10:49.200
but I've been thinking
about you.

1:10:49.333 --> 1:10:51.166
about us, a lot.

1:10:51.300 --> 1:10:52.533
I got in this morning,

1:10:52.667 --> 1:10:54.633
and I even stopped
at Sweeteats.

1:10:56.533 --> 1:10:58.433
They still have
those caramel turtles

1:10:58.567 --> 1:10:59.800
you like so much.

1:11:01.433 --> 1:11:02.967
I miss you, Maddy.

1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.567
I know I've made
a lot of mistakes...

1:11:10.900 --> 1:11:13.100
...but I'm trying
to make things right.

1:11:15.367 --> 1:11:18.967
I know you're probably busy
with the Holidays, but...

1:11:19.100 --> 1:11:21.100
if there is any chance

1:11:21.233 --> 1:11:23.900
that you feel the same...

1:11:25.667 --> 1:11:27.533
...I'll be at our spot,

1:11:27.667 --> 1:11:30.100
Christmas Eve, 9:00.

1:11:30.233 --> 1:11:31.667
I hope to see you there,

1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:35.100
but if I don't, I understand.

1:11:40.500 --> 1:11:41.700
Is this for you?

1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:45.533
Yeah.

1:11:47.100 --> 1:11:49.367
Do you know the place
he's referencing?

1:11:49.500 --> 1:11:51.367
It's the Starlight Diner,

1:11:51.500 --> 1:11:54.233
where we first met.

1:11:55.467 --> 1:11:57.200
He'll be
waiting for you there.

1:11:59.400 --> 1:12:01.367
He tried to reach me...

1:12:02.967 --> 1:12:06.100
I don't know what happened
between you two, I just...

1:12:06.233 --> 1:12:08.867
I just think you should really
hear him out.

1:12:10.900 --> 1:12:12.600
Because otherwise,
you're just always gonna wonder.

1:12:18.400 --> 1:12:20.033
You said your name
was Elizabeth?

1:12:20.166 --> 1:12:21.266
Mm-hmm.

1:12:21.400 --> 1:12:22.967
I think I have
something of yours.

1:12:24.033 --> 1:12:25.800
Mine?

1:12:28.500 --> 1:12:31.400
Hi, Elizabeth, this is Carter.

1:12:31.533 --> 1:12:33.200
Carter Bishop.

1:12:33.333 --> 1:12:36.000
I was hoping for a chance
to speak with you.

1:12:36.133 --> 1:12:38.900
I'd be very grateful
for the time.

1:12:39.033 --> 1:12:40.700
I'm staying
at the Guildcrest Hotel.

1:12:40.834 --> 1:12:42.300
You can reach me here.

1:12:42.433 --> 1:12:44.300
Merry Christmas.

1:12:50.200 --> 1:12:51.600
Carter Bishop?

1:12:57.200 --> 1:12:58.400
How do you know Carter?

1:12:58.533 --> 1:13:01.800
Three years ago, uh...

1:13:01.934 --> 1:13:04.934
I was in a car accident, um...

1:13:05.800 --> 1:13:08.133
...and we lost our best friend.

1:13:13.867 --> 1:13:16.934
♪ ...'cause it's Christmas
in the city, baby... ♪

1:13:17.066 --> 1:13:18.533
Look out!

1:13:18.667 --> 1:13:20.767
Lizzie!

1:14:01.300 --> 1:14:02.500
That was you?

1:14:04.700 --> 1:14:07.166
That accident
changed our lives.

1:14:07.300 --> 1:14:09.200
Carter never got over
the guilt.

1:14:09.333 --> 1:14:10.533
He pushed me away.

1:14:10.667 --> 1:14:12.934
He pushed everyone away.

1:14:13.066 --> 1:14:15.200
I tried so hard
to be there for him, but--

1:14:15.333 --> 1:14:16.233
He wouldn't listen.

1:14:16.367 --> 1:14:18.200
No.

1:14:18.333 --> 1:14:19.500
He wanted to be alone,

1:14:19.633 --> 1:14:21.800
so I deleted his number,

1:14:21.934 --> 1:14:24.900
tried my best to move on.

1:14:41.734 --> 1:14:46.233
This whole time
I was looking for him...

1:14:46.367 --> 1:14:49.667
he was looking for me.

1:14:49.800 --> 1:14:51.166
Are you going to go see him?

1:14:52.300 --> 1:14:54.500
No, I can't do that.

1:14:54.633 --> 1:14:57.033
No, seeing him would take me
right back to that night.

1:14:57.166 --> 1:14:58.367
Mm-mm.

1:14:58.500 --> 1:15:02.266
Lizzie, I don't think
we ever left that night.

1:15:02.400 --> 1:15:05.667
After Andy died, I...

1:15:05.800 --> 1:15:07.266
I ran away.

1:15:08.867 --> 1:15:11.000
Maybe in some way,
you did, too.

1:15:12.533 --> 1:15:14.066
I can't do this.

1:15:15.133 --> 1:15:17.200
You don't have to do it alone.

1:15:48.200 --> 1:15:50.367
Mr. Bishop?

1:15:55.367 --> 1:15:56.133
I'm, um--

1:15:56.266 --> 1:15:57.233
Miss Athens.

1:15:59.867 --> 1:16:02.467
You didn't return my call.

1:16:03.800 --> 1:16:06.533
I, uh, didn't get it until now.

1:16:07.700 --> 1:16:09.000
I don't understand.

1:16:09.133 --> 1:16:11.467
You didn't leave your message
on my voicemail.

1:16:12.600 --> 1:16:13.567
I didn't?

1:16:14.767 --> 1:16:16.567
You left it on Madelyn's.

1:16:18.033 --> 1:16:19.367
She got my message,

1:16:19.500 --> 1:16:22.867
and... I got hers.

1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:25.100
Is-is she here?

1:16:25.233 --> 1:16:27.367
No.

1:16:27.500 --> 1:16:28.433
No, sorry.

1:16:31.467 --> 1:16:32.834
Please sit.

1:16:32.967 --> 1:16:34.066
Mm-hmm.

1:16:34.867 --> 1:16:36.567
I'll be right here.

1:16:47.834 --> 1:16:50.700
So...

1:16:50.834 --> 1:16:52.367
why did you call me?

1:16:52.500 --> 1:16:56.433
I think about that night

1:16:56.567 --> 1:16:58.266
all the time.

1:16:59.333 --> 1:17:01.033
What I could have
done differently.

1:17:01.166 --> 1:17:05.000
If only I had
turned into the skid, or...

1:17:05.133 --> 1:17:07.367
left my house
a minute later...

1:17:09.300 --> 1:17:12.066
I punished myself
for a long time.

1:17:12.200 --> 1:17:14.834
I mean, what right did I have
to be happy

1:17:14.967 --> 1:17:17.033
when I stole someone else's?

1:17:17.166 --> 1:17:18.300
In the past year,

1:17:18.433 --> 1:17:19.767
I've started putting
the pieces of my life

1:17:19.900 --> 1:17:21.633
back together...

1:17:21.767 --> 1:17:23.133
Hmm.

1:17:23.266 --> 1:17:25.734
...and I knew there were
two calls I had to make.

1:17:30.233 --> 1:17:31.433
I wanted a chance

1:17:31.567 --> 1:17:34.667
to see you face to face...

1:17:36.133 --> 1:17:38.000
...and ask for your forgiveness.

1:17:42.133 --> 1:17:44.767
I didn't blame you.

1:17:44.900 --> 1:17:48.567
I blamed myself.

1:17:49.667 --> 1:17:50.567
No...

1:17:54.467 --> 1:17:57.467
It seems we've been carrying
this guilt around too long.

1:17:59.300 --> 1:18:02.066
Is it okay if we set it down?

1:18:05.834 --> 1:18:07.533
Thanks.

1:18:36.633 --> 1:18:37.734
Hi.

1:18:38.967 --> 1:18:40.767
Hi.

1:19:05.934 --> 1:19:07.700
Think she'll give him
a second chance?

1:19:07.834 --> 1:19:10.333
I hope so.

1:19:11.433 --> 1:19:12.900
I'm sorry.

1:19:13.033 --> 1:19:16.133
I should have
been there for you,

1:19:16.266 --> 1:19:18.500
even if you didn't
feel the same.

1:19:19.467 --> 1:19:20.934
What do you mean feel the same?

1:19:21.066 --> 1:19:22.734
When you told Andy
you had feelings for him,

1:19:22.867 --> 1:19:24.500
I was hurt, I was confused.

1:19:24.633 --> 1:19:25.767
I don't know.

1:19:25.900 --> 1:19:28.767
Told Andy
I had feelings for him?

1:19:32.400 --> 1:19:34.800
Josh...

1:19:38.333 --> 1:19:40.600
...I was talking about you.

1:19:44.767 --> 1:19:46.100
What?

1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:50.033
I was so nervous
to say anything to you that...

1:19:50.166 --> 1:19:53.700
I was just asking Andy
for advice.

1:19:56.934 --> 1:19:57.834
Wait...

1:20:00.767 --> 1:20:02.800
So you were--

1:20:05.200 --> 1:20:06.300
In love with you?

1:20:11.834 --> 1:20:13.300
I never stopped.

1:20:33.300 --> 1:20:34.700
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:20:34.834 --> 1:20:36.800
please welcome to the stage,

1:20:36.934 --> 1:20:38.000
Tenille Townes!

1:20:40.600 --> 1:20:42.834
How you doing tonight?

1:20:42.967 --> 1:20:44.834
Merry Christmas!

1:20:49.333 --> 1:20:51.667
