WEBVTT

00:21.700 --> 00:23.100
DAD, YOU GOTTA KICK MOM
OUT OF THE STORE,

00:23.100 --> 00:25.567
OR WE'RE GONNA GO BUST
BY TUESDAY.

00:25.567 --> 00:28.300
PUT THOSE DOWN. THOSE ARE
ROCK CLIMBING SHOES.

00:28.300 --> 00:30.500
YOU ARE NOT DOING
ANY ROCK CLIMBING,

00:30.500 --> 00:33.100
A SKINNY LITTLE MAN
LIKE YOU?

00:33.100 --> 00:36.700
WE AIN'T GONNA
MAKE IT TO TUESDAY.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.734
THERE IS A YOGURT STORE
DOWN THE STREET.

00:38.734 --> 00:41.467
NOW GO GET YOGURT.
THAT'S WHERE YOU BELONG.

00:41.467 --> 00:43.767
AND GET STRAWBERRY.

00:43.767 --> 00:45.667
I THINK THE CUSTOMERS
HAVE THEIR OWN MOTHERS

00:45.667 --> 00:48.600
WHO CAN
NAG THEM ABOUT THEIR
ROCK CLIMBING INTERESTS.

00:48.600 --> 00:49.600
YOU ASKED ME
TO HELP YOU

00:49.600 --> 00:51.200
'CAUSE THE STORE
WAS SO BUSY.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.300
IT'S JUST THAT YOU'VE BEEN
A PROTECTIVE MOTHER FIGURE
FOR SO LONG,

00:54.300 --> 00:57.934
IT'S KIND OF
GETTING IN THE WAY OF
WHAT WE USED TO CALL SALES.

00:57.934 --> 00:59.600
OH, YOU'RE CRAZY.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.133
KILL FISH?

01:01.133 --> 01:03.100
YOU'RE GONNA
KILL FISH?

01:03.100 --> 01:04.867
THE FISH STUFF
IS NOT MOVING, DAD.

01:13.567 --> 01:15.934
I HAVE SOLD SHOES.
I HAVE SOLD TIES.

01:15.934 --> 01:17.700
I'VE BEEN IN RETAIL
ALL MY LIFE.

01:17.700 --> 01:18.700
SELLING IS SELLING.

01:18.700 --> 01:21.767
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"TECHNICAL"?

01:21.767 --> 01:24.600
IS THIS FOR LIKE WATER?

01:28.600 --> 01:32.200
OW. OW. OW.

01:32.200 --> 01:37.033
SOMEBODY STOP ME.
OW. OW. OW.

01:37.033 --> 01:38.467
WE MIGHT AS WELL
FACE IT, DAD.

01:38.467 --> 01:39.600
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF PHILADELPHIA.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.800
WE'RE NEVER
GONNA FIND ANYBODY.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.867
YEAH. WHAT WE NEED
IS A GRIZZLY ADAMS
MOUNTAIN MAN

01:43.867 --> 01:45.100
WHO LIVES
THE OUTDOOR LIFE,

01:45.100 --> 01:47.200
KNOWS THIS EQUIPMENT,
WHO NEEDS A JOB,

01:47.200 --> 01:49.967
AND HAPPENS
TO WANDER IN HERE.

01:49.967 --> 01:51.467
EXCUSE ME.

01:51.467 --> 01:54.000
I JUST HAPPENED
TO WANDER IN HERE

01:54.000 --> 01:55.300
LOOKING FOR
THE YOGURT SHOP.

01:55.300 --> 01:57.033
I HEARD THEY WAS
HIRIN' SCOOPERS,

01:57.033 --> 02:00.100
ALTHOUGH I KNOW
A LOT LESS ABOUT YOGURT,

02:00.100 --> 02:01.600
SPRINKLES,
AND WAFFLE CONES

02:01.600 --> 02:04.500
THAN I DO ABOUT
WILDERNESS EQUIPMENT.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.700
I AM IN POWERFUL NEED
OF EMPLOYMENT.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.367
YEAH, IT'S FOUR DOORS
DOWN ON THE LEFT.
YA CAN'T MISS IT.

02:12.367 --> 02:13.500
MUCH OBLIGED.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.800
WAIT A MINUTE!

02:24.400 --> 02:25.367
HOLD ON THERE,
YOUNG MAN.

02:25.367 --> 02:26.500
YOU'RE NOT
LEAVING THIS HOUSE

02:26.500 --> 02:27.867
'TIL YOU HAVE YOURSELF
A HEALTHY BREAKFAST.

02:27.867 --> 02:29.867
THERE'S NO TIME.
CORY'S COMING BY
TO PICK ME UP.

02:29.867 --> 02:32.133
STICKY BUN AND
A FLINTSTONE VITAMIN.

02:32.133 --> 02:33.500
OOH, DINO.

02:33.500 --> 02:36.033
NOW YOU SIT DOWN.
I'LL JUST POP THIS
IN THE MICROWAVE.

02:36.033 --> 02:38.300
NO. NO.
NO TIME FOR THAT.

02:38.300 --> 02:39.900
THE BOY'S FRIEND'S
COMING BY

02:39.900 --> 02:41.800
AND FRIENDSHIP'S
MUCH MORE NOURISHING

02:41.800 --> 02:43.667
THAN ANY STICKY BUN
COULD EVER BE.

02:43.667 --> 02:45.233
WHAT'S IN
THE MICROWAVE, CHET?

02:45.233 --> 02:49.300
VIRNA, YOU CAN
CONTINUE TO ASK ME
SUSPICIOUS QUESTIONS,

02:49.300 --> 02:53.467
OR YOU CAN JOIN IN
AND EMBARK ON
A NEW RELATIONSHIP,

02:53.467 --> 02:56.300
ONE BASED ON
TRUST AND LOVE

02:56.300 --> 02:59.033
AND NOT GOIN'
IN THAT MICROWAVE.

03:00.867 --> 03:02.834
WHAT BILLS?

03:04.000 --> 03:06.834
WHAT ARE THESE BILLS
DOIN' IN THE MICROWAVE?

03:06.834 --> 03:09.033
THEY'RE FROM
THE OLD RELATIONSHIP,

03:09.033 --> 03:12.000
BUT WE'VE SET SAIL
ON THE GOOD SHIP
NEW RELATIONSHIP,

03:12.000 --> 03:15.800
AND NOTHIN'S
GONNA SET THAT SHIP
OFF COURSE.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.400
HEY, MR. HUNTER,
MRS. HUNTER.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.900
IT SURE IS
NICE TO SEE YOU
BACK TOGETHER,

03:19.900 --> 03:23.300
A WHOLE FAMILY AGAIN
IN HAPPY DOMESTIC BLISS.

03:23.300 --> 03:25.500
WELL,
AREN'T YOU SWEET.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.500
IF YOU DON'T WANNA SEE
THIS ENTIRE FAMILY

03:27.500 --> 03:29.233
LIVIN' IN AN AMANA
REFRIGERATOR BOX,

03:29.233 --> 03:30.834
YOU GET
YOUR SORRY ACT TOGETHER

03:30.834 --> 03:33.300
AND FIND SOME WAY
TO PAY THESE BILLS.

03:33.300 --> 03:38.000
PERHAPS I SHOULD
WAIT OUTSIDE WHERE THERE'S
A LITTLE LESS TENSION.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.767
Woman: YOU SPINELESS
DEADBEAT,

03:39.767 --> 03:43.300
HIDING THE BILLS
IN THE CAT BOX.
I'LL KILL YOU.

03:43.300 --> 03:45.734
IT'S FIRST OF THE MONTH
IN THE TRAILER PARK.

03:45.734 --> 03:48.967
NOW, VIRNA,
SUGARPIE, HONEYBUNCH,

03:48.967 --> 03:54.500
DON'T YOU GO
CHEWIN' MY LEG OFF OVER
A MINOR FINANCIAL FRACAS.

03:54.500 --> 03:59.600
THAT'S YOUR
NEW VOCABULARY WORD
FOR TODAY, BOYS--"FRACAS."

03:59.600 --> 04:00.667
CHET.

04:00.667 --> 04:01.734
YES, MA'AM?

04:01.734 --> 04:03.133
I HAVE BEEN
TEARIN' TICKETS

04:03.133 --> 04:04.467
EVERY AFTERNOON
AT THE MOVIE THEATER

04:04.467 --> 04:06.767
SO WE DON'T
HAVE TO HIDE BILLS
IN THE MICROWAVE,

04:06.767 --> 04:09.000
BUT PAY 'EM LIKE
NORMAL PEOPLE, CHET.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.700
I WANT TO BE NORMAL,
CHET.

04:15.700 --> 04:17.133
YOU KNOW, VIRNA,
IF WE'RE NOT PLEASED

04:17.133 --> 04:18.900
WITH OUR LITTLE JOB
AT THE THEATER,

04:18.900 --> 04:20.600
MAYBE WE SHOULD
SEEK EMPLOYMENT
ELSEWHERE,

04:20.600 --> 04:25.133
PREFERABLY ONE
THAT GIVES US A LITTLE MORE
JOB FULFILLMENT. WHAT?

04:25.133 --> 04:26.133
WE?

04:26.133 --> 04:27.133
WHAT?

04:27.133 --> 04:28.500
WE-- YOU SAID<i>WE</i>
WORK.

04:28.500 --> 04:33.233
<i>WE </i>DON'T WORK.
<i>I </i>WORK LIKE A PIG.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.367
WELL, MAYBE YOU BETTER
ASK FOR A RAISE

04:37.367 --> 04:42.200
'CAUSE WE GOT A MICROWAVE
FULL OF BILLS, HONEY.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.133
IT'S GOTTA BE BETTER
OUT THERE.

04:44.133 --> 04:47.200
Woman: I WANT
TO BE NORMAL, SPUD.

04:47.200 --> 04:50.500
I'M STUCK.

04:52.367 --> 04:57.467
DAD, MOM CAME BACK
BECAUSE SHE BELIEVED THINGS
WOULD BE DIFFERENT,

04:57.467 --> 05:00.400
SO YOU GOTTA
DO SOMETHING TO SHOW HER
THAT YOU'VE CHANGED,

05:00.400 --> 05:01.567
THAT IT IS
GONNA BE DIFFERENT.

05:01.567 --> 05:04.200
YOU'RE TALKIN' ABOUT ME
GETTIN' A 9 TO 5 JOB?

05:04.200 --> 05:07.000
THAT WOULD
BE DIFFERENT.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.767
WELL, MAYBE
YOU'RE RIGHT, SHAWNY.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.233
MAYBE IT'S TIME
I QUIT MY WAYS

05:11.233 --> 05:12.734
OF DREAMIN'
AND SCHEMIN',

05:12.734 --> 05:17.700
AND SETTLED DOWN,
GOT A JOB, AND
FOCUSED ON REALITY.

05:17.700 --> 05:18.934
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYIN'.

05:18.934 --> 05:21.700
'COURSE, WE'LL HAVE
TO MOVE TO PORTUGAL.

05:21.700 --> 05:22.967
PORTUGAL? WHY?

05:22.967 --> 05:25.667
IT'S THE PEARL DIVING
CAPITAL OF THE WORLD,
SON.

05:25.667 --> 05:28.000
YOU KNOW, I CAN
HOLD MY BREATH UNDERWATER
FOR OVER FOUR MINUTES?

05:28.000 --> 05:31.567
THAT SHOULD HELP YOU
WHEN SHE THROWS YOU
OFF THE BRIDGE.

05:31.567 --> 05:34.734
DAD,
I'M TALKING ABOUT
A NORMAL JOB.

05:34.734 --> 05:36.600
WE WANT TO BE NORMAL,
CHET.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.900
GANG UP ON ME,
WHY DON'T YA?

05:38.900 --> 05:41.800
I SUPPOSE YOU WANT ME
TO GET A JOB, TOO?

05:41.800 --> 05:45.200
WHATEVER WOULD
CALM EVERYBODY DOWN'S
FINE WITH ME.

05:49.867 --> 05:51.200
THIS ISN'T
GONNA WORK.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.200
IS.
ISN'T.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.300
I THINK YOU
ARE SO IMMATURE.

05:53.300 --> 05:57.400
WELL, THAT'S WHAT IT IS
TO BE A GUY, HONEY.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.834
THAT WASN'T
HOMER SIMPSON.

06:00.834 --> 06:05.033
OHH. SORRY, KID.
I COULD'VE SWORN
IT WAS HIM.

06:10.033 --> 06:11.467
WOW, THREE AT ONCE.

06:11.467 --> 06:15.033
AND THEY SAID
IT COULDN'T BE DONE.
THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN.

06:15.033 --> 06:17.467
YOU'VE BEEN GREAT SPORTS.
THANKS FOR PLAYIN' OUR GAME.

06:17.467 --> 06:18.600
COME BACK ANYTIME.

06:18.600 --> 06:19.900
OOH, VERY GOOD.

06:19.900 --> 06:21.467
ANYTIME YOU CAN
HUMILIATE PEOPLE

06:21.467 --> 06:23.200
WHO ARE WEAKER
OR DEFENSELESS,

06:23.200 --> 06:25.233
YOU SHOULD
CERTAINLY GO FOR IT.

06:25.233 --> 06:28.100
ALL RIGHT,
SHE GOT THE BIT.

06:28.100 --> 06:29.967
SHAWN, WHAT A MESS.

06:29.967 --> 06:31.600
INDEED. BUT NOW,
THE SCHOOL JANITOR

06:31.600 --> 06:32.767
WILL HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO,

06:32.767 --> 06:35.600
THUS WE HAVE
ENSURED HIS JOB
FOR ANOTHER DAY,

06:35.600 --> 06:38.667
THEREBY HELP
THE ECONOMY.

06:38.667 --> 06:41.000
WE ARE
SO UNDERAPPRECIATED.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.934
UH, SORRY ABOUT
THE MESS HERE,
MR. JANITOR, SIR--

06:46.567 --> 06:47.800
DAD?

06:47.800 --> 06:49.100
MR. HUNTER?

06:49.100 --> 06:52.033
CHET HUNTER--EDUCATIONAL
CUSTODIAL SERVICES.

06:52.033 --> 06:54.200
NORMAL JOB
FOR NORMAL PEOPLE.

06:59.767 --> 07:00.700
DAD?

07:00.700 --> 07:01.734
YEAH.

07:01.734 --> 07:02.734
REMEMBER MOM?
YEAH.

07:02.734 --> 07:03.934
HE BETTER.

07:03.934 --> 07:07.800
YOU GOT YOUR SHOES,
YOUR PITONS,
PLENTY OF ROPE,

07:07.800 --> 07:11.367
A COMPLETE GRAPPLING SET,
AND A FULL HARNESS.

07:11.367 --> 07:14.133
NOW, YOU'RE
GONNA NEED THIS.

07:14.133 --> 07:17.900
AND I MUST SAY,
YOU LOOK JUST DAZZLING.

07:17.900 --> 07:22.600
ACTUALLY,
I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT
THIS ROCK CLIMBING.

07:22.600 --> 07:26.567
I MEAN, I PREFER,
YOU KNOW, AN ELEVATOR.

07:26.567 --> 07:28.300
THIS AIN'T ABOUT
ROCK CLIMBING.

07:28.300 --> 07:31.834
THIS IS ABOUT
YOUR EVOLUTION
AS A HUMAN BEING.

07:31.834 --> 07:32.967
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

07:32.967 --> 07:34.200
EDGAR.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.000
AND YOU WANNA
BE EDGAR ALL YOUR LIFE?

07:37.000 --> 07:39.200
YOU CAN
GET ME OUT OF IT?

07:39.200 --> 07:40.233
HEH HEH HEH.

07:40.233 --> 07:42.900
ERIC, HE'S GONNA
KILL THAT LITTLE MAN.

07:42.900 --> 07:45.834
THE GUY CAME IN
BECAUSE HE WANTED
SOME BOO-BOO CREAM.

07:45.834 --> 07:48.133
EZEKIAL SOLD HIM
$700 WORTH OF EQUIPMENT.

07:48.133 --> 07:51.367
YES, BUT
YOU SEE, SON, IF ALL
OUR CUSTOMERS ARE DEAD

07:51.367 --> 07:52.567
FROM FALLING
OFF OF MOUNTAINS,

07:52.567 --> 07:56.900
AT SOME POINT,
BUSINESS FALLS OFF, TOO.

07:56.900 --> 07:58.100
MY DAD'S THE JANITOR.

07:58.100 --> 08:02.367
THERE IS NO SHAME
IN YOUR FATHER
BEING A JANITOR.

08:02.367 --> 08:03.834
MY DAD'S THE JANITOR.

08:03.834 --> 08:05.133
IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU DWELL ON,

08:05.133 --> 08:06.400
IT'S NOT
GONNA SOUND GOOD.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.700
BUT HE COULD'VE
BEEN ANYTHING.

08:07.700 --> 08:10.667
MY DAD HAS ALL THESE
WONDERFUL DREAMS.

08:10.667 --> 08:12.500
AND WHY DOES HE HAVE
TO BE A JANITOR HERE?

08:12.500 --> 08:14.767
EVERYBODY NEEDS A JOB.
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT.

08:19.867 --> 08:24.767
HEY, HUNTER.
I HEAR OUR DADS
HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

08:24.767 --> 08:26.400
AND YOU SAY THAT WHY?

08:26.400 --> 08:29.133
MY FATHER'S A DOCTOR,
AND YOUR FATHER'S--

08:29.133 --> 08:34.867
OH, WAIT.
HE CLEANS TOILETS.
MY MISTAKE.

08:37.367 --> 08:39.400
WELL, THAT WAS
VERY FUNNY,

08:39.400 --> 08:41.033
AND IF YOU
KEEP IT UP,

08:41.033 --> 08:43.500
I'M GONNA
PUNCH YOUR HEAD OFF.

08:43.500 --> 08:46.767
AND THEN YOUR FATHER'S
GONNA PICK IT UP.

08:46.767 --> 08:48.300
HEY, EVERYTHING OK HERE?

08:48.300 --> 08:51.767
'CAUSE IF IT IS,
WE'RE JUST GONNA TAKE
A LITTLE BRIEF BREAK

08:51.767 --> 08:56.600
FOR YOUR EDUCATION,
'KAY? GREAT. THANKS.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.467
THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.

08:59.467 --> 09:01.000
OK, NOW LAST TIME,

09:01.000 --> 09:04.200
WE SAW HOW H.G. WELLS
PAINTS A REAL BLEAK PICTURE

09:04.200 --> 09:05.600
OF CLASS DIFFERENCES
IN THE FUTURE.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.567
ABOVE THE SURFACE,
YOU HAVE THE ELOI LIVIN'
THE GOOD LIFE.

09:08.567 --> 09:11.867
BELOW THE SURFACE,
LIVIN' LIKE ANIMALS,
YOU GOT THE MORLOCKS

09:11.867 --> 09:13.800
DOIN' ALL THE DIRTY WORK.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.600
SPEAKING
OF YOUR DAD...

09:17.600 --> 09:19.133
SPEAKING OF HEAD OFF.

09:19.133 --> 09:21.300
THERE ARE
NO PICTURES
IN THE BOOK,

09:21.300 --> 09:22.800
SO I THOUGHT
WE MIGHT TAKE A LOOK
AT THE FILM VERSION

09:22.800 --> 09:25.900
OF<i>THE TIME MACHINE</i>
SO FOR ONE TIME THIS YEAR,

09:25.900 --> 09:28.600
YOU'LL KNOW
WHAT THE HECK
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

09:28.600 --> 09:29.867
HERE YOU GO, TEACH.

09:29.867 --> 09:31.000
THANKS, CHET.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.133
HEY, SHAWN.

09:32.133 --> 09:34.500
WAS THAT NICE MAN
YOUR DADDY?

09:34.500 --> 09:36.400
SHUT UP, CRANDALL.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.667
IGNORE HIM.

09:38.667 --> 09:41.133
OOPS, LOOK AT
THE MESS I MADE.

09:41.133 --> 09:44.467
GUESS I BETTER
GO GET YOUR FATHER
TO CLEAN IT UP.

09:44.467 --> 09:46.300
HEY, SHAWN'S PAPPY.

09:46.300 --> 09:49.233
DOUG, WHY DON'T YOU
DO ME A FAVOR FIRST?

09:49.233 --> 09:51.100
SURE, HUNTER.
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU?

09:51.100 --> 09:52.300
YOU CAN BLEED.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.600
HEY, HEY, HEY!
KNOCK IT OFF,
BOTH OF YA!

09:55.600 --> 09:57.233
KNOCK IT OFF!

10:03.400 --> 10:06.967
WELL, IT'S MR. HUNTER
IN MY OFFICE

10:06.967 --> 10:09.600
FOR GETTING INTO A FIGHT.

10:09.600 --> 10:14.900
LET ME SHOW YOU
MY BIG SURPRISED FACE.

10:14.900 --> 10:16.133
COME ON, MR. FEENY,

10:16.133 --> 10:19.000
JUST PUNISH ME,
AND LET'S GET ON
WITH OUR LIVES.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.767
THIS IS MY LIFE,
MR. HUNTER--

10:20.767 --> 10:24.800
ASKING YOU WHAT YOU'VE DONE
AND WHY YOU HAVE DONE IT.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.600
IT'S NOTHING I DID.

10:26.600 --> 10:30.734
IT'S ABOUT YOU
HIRING MY FATHER
TO BE THE JANITOR.

10:30.734 --> 10:33.800
MY DAD IS
PICKING UP GARBAGE
AT MY SCHOOL.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.467
HOW COULD YOU
DO THAT TO ME,
MR. FEENY?

10:37.133 --> 10:40.100
WELL, NOW,
SHAWN, I NEVER
ACTUALLY CONSIDERED

10:40.100 --> 10:42.667
IT WOULD BE AWKWARD
HAVING YOUR FATHER
WORK HERE.

10:42.667 --> 10:44.900
HEY,
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL?

10:44.900 --> 10:47.033
WELL...

10:47.033 --> 10:49.734
IF YOUR FATHER
WORKING HERE

10:49.734 --> 10:51.300
IS DISRUPTIVE
TO YOUR EDUCATION,

10:51.300 --> 10:55.934
I WILL CERTAINLY
HAVE TO RECONSIDER
HIS EMPLOYMENT.

10:55.934 --> 10:57.967
YOU MEAN THAT?

10:57.967 --> 10:59.400
YOU'RE
ON MY SIDE?

10:59.400 --> 11:01.200
FRIGHTENING,
ISN'T IT?

11:01.200 --> 11:04.734
HOWEVER, RATHER THAN
TAKE SIDES HERE,

11:04.734 --> 11:08.233
I THINK THE BEST COURSE
WOULD BE TO THROW IT
TO YOU.

11:08.233 --> 11:10.900
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:10.900 --> 11:13.734
I MEAN YOU ARE MY STUDENT,
AND YOU HAVE A RIGHT
TO DECIDE

11:13.734 --> 11:16.834
WHETHER
YOU WANT YOUR FATHER
TO WORK HERE OR NOT.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.400
SO IT'S UP TO ME?

11:20.400 --> 11:24.867
YES, MR. HUNTER.
IT'S UP TO YOU.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.500
[DOOR OPENS]

11:32.367 --> 11:33.700
[DOOR CLOSES]

11:41.200 --> 11:42.600
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:42.600 --> 11:46.100
NOTHING. I JUST
WANNA MAKE SURE THAT
I DON'T MAKE A MESS.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.600
SINCE WHEN DO YOU CARE
WHETHER YOU MAKE A MESS
OR NOT?

11:48.600 --> 11:50.400
I DON'T.
I JUST THINK THAT
WHEN YOU MAKE A MESS,

11:50.400 --> 11:51.700
SOMEBODY'S
GOTTA CLEAN IT UP,

11:51.700 --> 11:53.900
AND I DON'T WANT
ANYBODY TO CLEAN IT UP.

11:54.867 --> 11:56.033
MY DAD'S THE JANITOR.

11:56.033 --> 11:58.800
WHY ARE YOU
ALWAYS ON THAT?

12:01.600 --> 12:02.867
SO THE TOILET OVERFLOWS,

12:02.867 --> 12:05.767
AND FEENY
ASKS THE NEW JANITOR
IF HE CAN HANDLE IT.

12:05.767 --> 12:08.033
GUY SAYS, "HEY,
WHEN I WAS WITH
THE C.I.A.,

12:08.033 --> 12:10.100
"I MOPPED UP AFTER
THE SANDINISTAS.

12:10.100 --> 12:12.700
I THINK
I CAN MOP UP THIS."

12:12.700 --> 12:16.367
JANITORS ARE SO COLORFUL.

12:22.500 --> 12:23.900
MR. FEENY.

12:23.900 --> 12:25.400
YEAH?

12:25.400 --> 12:27.233
I'VE
THOUGHT IT OVER.

12:27.233 --> 12:29.500
THAT TOOK
ALL OF FIVE MINUTES.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.500
I'M GLAD YOU GAVE IT
THE TIME IT DESERVED.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.000
I THINK
IT'D BE BEST
FOR EVERYBODY

12:33.000 --> 12:34.200
IF YOU JUST
LET MY DAD GO.

12:34.200 --> 12:39.967
AH. WELL, IT IS IMPORTANT
TO LOOK OUT FOR EVERYBODY.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.800
SO WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA LET HIM GO?

12:42.800 --> 12:46.100
IT MIGHT TAKE A FEW DAYS
TO FIND A REPLACEMENT.

12:46.100 --> 12:49.767
I'LL TELL YOUR FATHER
ABOUT MY DECISION
AFTER THAT, ALL RIGHT?

12:49.767 --> 12:52.133
OK.
THANKS, MR. FEENY.

12:52.133 --> 12:54.967
NO TROUBLE,
MR. HUNTER.

12:57.300 --> 13:00.734
OH, MAN!
WHAT PIG ATE HERE?

13:00.734 --> 13:02.700
HOW'D I NOT
SEE THAT?

13:02.700 --> 13:05.567
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU
THINK ABOUT IT, COR,

13:05.567 --> 13:06.867
I'M ACTUALLY
DOING MY DAD A FAVOR.

13:06.867 --> 13:10.133
HE NEEDS A JOB WHERE
HE CAN DO SOMETHING
IMPORTANT.

13:10.133 --> 13:14.300
YEAH, I THINK I'M MAKING
THE RIGHT DECISION.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.300
DO YOU KNOW THERE ARE
NO ROCK CLIMBING SHOES
LEFT IN THE STOCKROOM?

13:23.300 --> 13:28.000
YOU KNOW WHY?
EZEKIAL SOLD 'EM.
HE SOLD EVERY PAIR OF 'EM.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.500
YES, BUT HE SOLD THEM
TO PEOPLE

13:29.500 --> 13:31.667
WHO HAD NO BUSINESS
BUYING THEM AT ALL.

13:31.667 --> 13:34.400
IF WE JUST GET PAST
THAT LITTLE NAGGING
MORAL ISSUE

13:34.400 --> 13:35.500
THAT ALL THOSE PEOPLE
ARE GONNA DIE,

13:35.500 --> 13:37.834
WE COULD BE
VERY SUCCESSFUL,
RIGHT, DAD?

13:37.834 --> 13:40.500
ERIC, I HAD
A DREAM LAST NIGHT.

13:40.500 --> 13:45.000
SKINNY LITTLE MEN
IN BRAND-NEW
ROCK CLIMBING SHOES,

13:45.000 --> 13:46.767
FALLING OFF A MOUNTAIN,
SCREAMING AT ME,

13:46.767 --> 13:52.767
"YOU SOLD ME THESE,
YOU MERCHANT OF DEAAAA."

13:53.200 --> 13:55.400
MERCHANT OF DEA?

13:55.400 --> 13:56.900
DEATH.
OH.

13:56.900 --> 14:00.867
LOOK, DAD, IF WE WEREN'T
MAKING STACKS AND STACKS
OF MONEY

14:00.867 --> 14:02.734
LIKE WE ARE,
THEN DREAMS LIKE THAT

14:02.734 --> 14:05.700
WOULD REALLY BUG US,
WOULDN'T THEY?

14:07.000 --> 14:08.767
ALAN, ERIC,

14:08.767 --> 14:11.567
TERRIBLE NEWS
FROM THE HILL COUNTRY.

14:11.567 --> 14:13.400
WHAT, THEY FOUND
THE BODIES?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.834
MY MAMA'S TOOK SICK.

14:24.300 --> 14:26.567
POWERFUL SICK?

14:26.567 --> 14:28.000
INDEED, ERIC.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.400
AND SHE SENT WORD
THAT SHE WANTS ME
TO COME HOME

14:30.400 --> 14:31.400
AND TEND TO HER.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.600
WAIT A SECOND.
YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.133
WE DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SELL STUFF.

14:35.133 --> 14:37.400
NOT TO WORRY,
YOUNG ERIC.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.100
I'D NEVER LEAVE
YOU KIND FOLKS
IN THE LURCH.

14:40.100 --> 14:42.300
THAT'S WHY
I GOT MY BROTHER'S
YOUNGSTER LONNIE

14:42.300 --> 14:43.767
TO COME DOWN HERE
AND TAKE MY PLACE.

14:43.767 --> 14:47.467
AND THIS LONNIE
HAS YOUR SAME
MOUNTAIN INNOCENCE

14:47.467 --> 14:48.867
AND SAVVY SENSE
OF RETAIL?

14:48.867 --> 14:51.233
DAD, NO. LET ME
TAKE THIS ONE, OK?

14:51.233 --> 14:54.133
NOW YOU LOOKEE HERE,
EZEKIAL.

14:54.133 --> 14:57.567
WE HIRED YOU, OK?
WE DIDN'T HIRE LONNIE.

14:57.567 --> 15:00.400
WE DON'T KNOW LONNIE.
WE DON'T WANT LONNIE, OK?

15:00.400 --> 15:04.900
WHY DON'T YOU TELL LONNIE
TO GO BACK WHERE LONNIE
CAME FROM?

15:04.900 --> 15:07.400
HI. I'M LONNIE.

15:07.400 --> 15:08.667
LONNIE!

15:08.667 --> 15:11.867
HEY, DAD,
LOOK WHO'S HERE.
IT'S LONNIE!

15:22.500 --> 15:25.200
SO THERE'S
THIS KID AT SCHOOL,

15:25.200 --> 15:27.834
AND HIS MILK
FELL OFF HIS TRAY

15:27.834 --> 15:29.567
AND WENT
ALL OVER THE FLOOR.

15:29.567 --> 15:31.300
IN THE BROAD
SCHEME OF THINGS,

15:31.300 --> 15:33.400
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
WORSE DAYS, SON.

15:33.400 --> 15:37.300
AND THEN
SOMEBODY CAME ALONG
AND CLEANED UP THAT MILK.

15:37.300 --> 15:39.700
AND HE DID THIS
IN FRONT OF ALL
YOUR FRIENDS?

15:39.700 --> 15:42.467
YEAH, RIGHT IN FRONT
OF EVERYBODY.

15:42.467 --> 15:45.734
I SEE. WELL, DID HE
DO A GOOD JOB?

15:45.734 --> 15:51.133
DID HE LEAVE
THE FLOOR CLEAN
AND LEMONY FRESH?

15:51.133 --> 15:52.700
MOM, DAD'S A JANITOR.

15:52.700 --> 15:56.200
HE'S A SCHOOL JANITOR.
IT'S HUMILIATING.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.467
I'M SORRY
YOU FEEL THAT WAY

15:57.467 --> 16:00.200
BECAUSE
I'M SO PROUD OF HIM
I COULD BUST.

16:00.200 --> 16:03.300
MOM, WHAT'S THERE
TO BE PROUD OF?

16:03.300 --> 16:07.734
FOR 20 YEARS,
WE HAVE LIVED ON
YOUR FATHER'S STORIES,

16:07.734 --> 16:09.767
AND THOSE STORIES JUST
USED TO MAKE ME ANGRY

16:09.767 --> 16:11.100
'CAUSE NONE OF THEM
WERE REAL,

16:11.100 --> 16:14.900
BUT YOUR STORY
ABOUT YOUR FATHER
BEING A JANITOR,

16:14.900 --> 16:16.300
THAT'S REAL.

16:16.300 --> 16:19.033
AND, YEAH,
IT MAKES ME PROUD.

16:21.734 --> 16:23.000
WELL, HELLO THERE,

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
MY LITTLE
NUCLEAR FAMILY UNIT.
HEH HEH HEH.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.400
THERE'S MY WIFE
MAKING SUPPER.

16:29.400 --> 16:30.934
THERE'S MY SON
HOME FROM SCHOOL.

16:30.934 --> 16:35.800
THE ONLY THING MISSING
TO COMPLETE THIS SCENE
OF DOMESTIC REGULARITY

16:35.800 --> 16:37.567
IS DAD'S FIRST PAYCHECK.

16:37.567 --> 16:43.000
WELL, LOOKEE HERE.
AND I EARNED IT.
I REALLY DID.

16:47.467 --> 16:48.934
WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT?

16:48.934 --> 16:50.734
THERE'S PLENTY MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM

16:50.734 --> 16:55.000
THAT YOU PROBABLY
WON'T RECOGNIZE, EITHER,
MR. PAYCHECK.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.800
VIRNA, NOT IN FRONT
OF THE BOY.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.667
WITH ME CHASING YOU
AROUND THE COUNTRY
FOR A YEAR,

16:59.667 --> 17:03.834
I AIN'T REALLY HAD
A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN
TO YOUNG SHAWNY THERE

17:03.834 --> 17:07.467
THE--WELL, YOU KNOW,
THE DIRTINESS OF LIFE.

17:07.467 --> 17:11.667
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU,
CHET.

17:11.667 --> 17:15.567
THANKS, VIRNA.
AND I THINK I'M DOIN'
A GOOD JOB, TOO,

17:15.567 --> 17:17.467
'CAUSE MR. FEENY,
THE PRINCIPAL,

17:17.467 --> 17:18.800
WANTS TO SEE ME
IN HIS OFFICE

17:18.800 --> 17:20.100
FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.

17:20.100 --> 17:25.300
HEY, KIND OF LIKE
FATHER LIKE SON,
HUH, SHAWN?

17:25.300 --> 17:26.967
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
BOY?

17:26.967 --> 17:28.600
DAD, ARE YOU OK
WITH THIS JOB?

17:28.600 --> 17:32.200
IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU
TO BE CLEANING UP
AFTER OTHER PEOPLE?

17:32.200 --> 17:34.600
IT AIN'T EXACTLY
PEARL DIVIN'
IN PORTUGAL,

17:34.600 --> 17:40.200
BUT, WELL,
IT HAS THIS AMAZING
BENEFITS PACKAGE.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.867
WHAT BENEFITS ARE THERE
TO BEING A JANITOR?

17:42.867 --> 17:46.834
AFTER BEING
ON THE ROAD A YEAR
AWAY FROM MY SON,

17:46.834 --> 17:52.300
WHAT BETTER BENEFIT
THAN A JOB THAT
LETS ME BE NEAR HIM?

18:07.934 --> 18:09.000
MR. FEENY.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.200
MR. HUNTER...
AT SCHOOL...EARLY.

18:13.200 --> 18:17.400
WELL, MY LIFE'S WORK
IS DONE.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.934
GOOD-BYE, EVERYONE.

18:18.934 --> 18:22.033
NO, NO, MR. FEENY.
I'M HERE BECAUSE...

18:22.033 --> 18:24.200
WELL, YOU HAVEN'T
TALKED TO MY DAD YET,
HAVE YOU?

18:24.200 --> 18:27.000
NO. WE HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT
IN A FEW MINUTES.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.834
WELL, IF IT'S
NOT TOO LATE,

18:28.834 --> 18:30.867
LISTEN, I'D LIKE
TO CHANGE MY MIND.

18:30.867 --> 18:33.667
OH, WELL, I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT THAT.

18:33.667 --> 18:35.033
I'VE ALREADY
STARTED THE PROCESS

18:35.033 --> 18:36.800
OF SEARCHING
FOR A REPLACEMENT.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.133
YOU HAVE
TO CANCEL IT, OK?

18:38.133 --> 18:39.734
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
JUST DO THAT TO A GUY

18:39.734 --> 18:41.100
WHO'S FINALLY FOUND
A STEADY JOB.

18:41.100 --> 18:42.967
AND MY MOM, WHO'S BEEN
WAITING ALL THIS TIME

18:42.967 --> 18:45.300
FOR HIM
TO BE RESPONSIBLE,
CAME TO THE CHAIR

18:45.300 --> 18:46.934
AND PUT HER ARM
AROUND HIM.

18:46.934 --> 18:48.567
MM-HMM.

18:48.567 --> 18:51.700
YOU HAVE TO CANCEL IT.

18:51.700 --> 18:54.200
OKEY-DOKEY.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.500
WHAT, JUST LIKE THAT?

18:56.500 --> 18:58.934
I'M THE PRINCIPAL,
MR. HUNTER.

18:58.934 --> 19:01.133
I WIELD GREAT
AND MYSTERIOUS POWERS.

19:01.133 --> 19:06.767
BESIDES THAT, I WAS NEVER
GOING TO FIRE YOUR FATHER
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

19:06.767 --> 19:07.900
WHY NOT?

19:07.900 --> 19:11.100
BECAUSE THIS WAS NEVER
ABOUT YOUR FATHER, SHAWN.

19:11.100 --> 19:12.734
THIS WAS ALWAYS ABOUT YOU.

19:12.734 --> 19:15.934
YOU'RE THE KID.
YOU'RE IN SCHOOL.

19:15.934 --> 19:18.300
IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT YOU.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.467
WELL, WHAT THE HECK
WAS THAT?

19:24.467 --> 19:27.233
I DON'T KNOW. THE MAN
JUST RUNS OUR LIVES.

19:27.233 --> 19:31.100
WHAT WAS SO IMPORTANT
THAT WE HAD TO BE HERE
FIVE MINUTES EARLY?

19:31.100 --> 19:36.467
OH, I, UH,
JUST WANTED YOU
TO DRINK THIS MILK.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.800
ALL RIGHT. I GUESS
I COULD ALWAYS USE
A LITTLE MILK.

19:41.800 --> 19:44.934
IS THIS ANOTHER ONE
OF THOSE DELIGHTFUL
LITTLE STUNTS?

19:44.934 --> 19:47.367
ACTUALLY, I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE
THIS ONE.

19:47.367 --> 19:51.467
SHAWN, LOOK WHAT
YOU JUST MADE ME DO.

19:51.467 --> 19:52.667
YEAH. SORRY, MAN.

19:52.667 --> 19:53.934
HEY, HUNTER,

19:53.934 --> 19:57.233
LOOKS LIKE WE GET
TO START ANOTHER DAY
WITH YOUR DAD.

19:57.233 --> 19:59.400
YEP, LOOKS LIKE
WE DO, DOUG.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.300
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
I'M NEEDED HERE.

20:01.300 --> 20:05.800
HOLD IT. HERE, DAD.
LET ME TAKE CARE
OF THAT.

20:07.033 --> 20:11.200
UH, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT,
SHAWN.

20:11.200 --> 20:14.600
I KNOW I DON'T.
AND I KNOW YOU DON'T,
EITHER.

20:26.767 --> 20:29.467
BOW HUNTIN' TAKES
A SPECIAL KIND OF MAN,

20:29.467 --> 20:31.600
A MAN WHO CAN
STAND HIS GROUND

20:31.600 --> 20:32.600
WHEN A CHARGING
GRIZZLY BEAR'S

20:32.600 --> 20:33.600
COMIN' RIGHT AT HIM.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.100
I WORK FOR MERRILL LYNCH.

20:36.100 --> 20:38.100
YOU'LL BE FINE.

20:38.100 --> 20:40.467
I MUST SAY, I'M
A LITTLE CONCERNED

20:40.467 --> 20:41.934
ABOUT YOUR NIECE
WORKING HERE.

20:41.934 --> 20:43.600
SHE SEEMS LIKE
A SWEET, NICE GIRL,

20:43.600 --> 20:45.367
BUT SHE IS ON
THE ATTRACTIVE SIDE

20:45.367 --> 20:47.767
AND COULD BE
A DISTRACTION TO
A LOT OF YOUNG MEN,

20:47.767 --> 20:49.700
LIKE, OH, SAY,
<i>MY SON</i>

20:49.700 --> 20:52.000
WHO HAS TO WORK
WITH HER EVERY DAY.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.300
NOT TO WORRY,
MR. MATTHEWS.

20:53.300 --> 20:56.600
LONNETTA WAS RAISED
WITH 11 BROTHERS,

20:56.600 --> 20:57.600
9 MALES COUSINS,

20:57.600 --> 21:00.066
AND A WHOLE PACK
OF BLOODHOUND DOGS.

21:00.066 --> 21:02.400
WE BRUNG HER UP
AS GIRLIE AS WE COULD,

21:02.400 --> 21:07.000
BUT DANGED IF SHE JUST
DIDN'T TURN OUT ALL BOY.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
[CLEARS THROAT]

21:08.000 --> 21:09.200
SO, LONNIE,

21:09.200 --> 21:11.100
APPARENTLY
WE'RE GOING TO BE
WORKING TOGETHER.
