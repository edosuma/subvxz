WEBVTT

00:04.065 --> 00:07.527
You know, they can never tell
whether I know what I'm doing or not.

00:07.636 --> 00:10.700
- Can you tell?
- Not really.

00:10.807 --> 00:14.611
- We have a reputation here
at Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

00:14.712 --> 00:19.552
The attorneys here take great
pride in that reputation.

00:19.650 --> 00:22.350
It undermines everyone at
Crane, Poole & Schmidt-

00:22.454 --> 00:26.589
- Stop it! - So you’re Shirley
Schmidt of Crane, Poole &-

00:26.693 --> 00:29.130
- Schmidt.
- Alan Shore. It's a pleasure.

00:29.229 --> 00:31.062
- Denny Crane.
- Oh!

00:31.164 --> 00:37.076
I once had a torrid,
torrid affair with that woman.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.734
- First, everybody knows that.
- Second, the word would be "horrid. "

00:39.841 --> 00:43.246
You don't know me, Alan Shore,
not as well as you think.

00:43.345 --> 00:45.977
- How are you?
- You killed again!

00:46.082 --> 00:50.387
You got blood on my hands that will
never come out. friends don't do that!

00:50.487 --> 00:54.086
Do not start a war with me
here! You may not win it!

00:54.191 --> 00:58.599
- We look good together.
- Yes, we do.

00:58.697 --> 01:03.469
And now, the season
premiere of Boston Legal.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.019 --> 01:22.088
- Denny, we look good, right?
- We look great.

01:42.315 --> 01:44.752
- Did she say what kind of case?
- Wrongful termination.

01:44.852 --> 01:47.323
The employer was trying to enforce
his religion or something.

01:47.421 --> 01:49.892
- The plaintiff quit and sued.
- And it's going to trial?

01:49.991 --> 01:53.226
You have to get me in to
meet her. You simply must.

01:53.328 --> 01:55.959
- How did you even know she was here?
- Don't be ridiculous.

01:56.065 --> 01:59.596
There's a Web site that tracks
her as sure as I am little.

01:59.703 --> 02:03.074
If I could just get a
peek, a little whiff.

02:12.351 --> 02:14.948
- Why are you here, Bernard?
- Well, never mind me.

02:15.054 --> 02:18.619
The Black Widow is here. She's
in your office as we speak...

02:18.725 --> 02:20.627
as sure as I am little.

02:20.727 --> 02:23.894
- The woman who murdered her husband?
- You make it sound so ordinary.

02:23.998 --> 02:27.233
It was the way she did
it. They were concubining.

02:27.334 --> 02:30.865
She's in there with Brad.
Evidently, she fired her last lawyer.

02:30.973 --> 02:34.504
And for whatever reason, she wants you.

02:34.610 --> 02:39.018
- Denny, the conference call with Jack
Meyers has begun- - You take it.

02:39.116 --> 02:41.485
- The Black Widow is here.
- I can't take it. I'm in a meeting.

02:41.585 --> 02:43.487
Which means that you have to take it.

02:43.587 --> 02:45.751
And since this man pays us
over two million dollars a year-

02:45.857 --> 02:49.058
Not everything is about money,
Shirley. Sometimes, sex counts too.

02:49.161 --> 02:51.894
It used to count with you. One
minute, you couldn't get enough of me.

02:51.997 --> 02:55.061
The next, you lose interest. What
happened, Shirley? I need to know.

02:55.168 --> 02:57.138
They invented color television.

02:57.237 --> 02:59.730
You and me, in my office.
Give me two minutes.

02:59.840 --> 03:02.277
If you could last three,
I might consider it.

03:02.376 --> 03:05.314
- In the meantime,
Jack Meyers- - Not now.

03:05.413 --> 03:07.976
The Black Widow gets me first.

03:08.083 --> 03:10.885
I'm not saying that
we can't win, Walter.

03:10.987 --> 03:13.288
I'm saying it's not likely
and that we should settle.

03:13.389 --> 03:17.090
It's my company, Denise, and I'm
tired of apologizing for my faith.

03:17.194 --> 03:20.292
You can't have the Bible be
assigned reading in the workplace.

03:20.397 --> 03:22.230
Denny Crane.

03:22.333 --> 03:25.170
You've come to the right
firm. I can tell you that-

03:25.270 --> 03:27.570
My God. You're even
more striking in person.

03:27.673 --> 03:31.113
Who is this man, and why is
his face about to explode?

03:31.211 --> 03:33.181
Kelly Nolan, this is Denny Crane.

03:33.279 --> 03:35.078
Success has caused his head to swell.

03:35.182 --> 03:37.676
It'll be an honor to defend your honor.

03:37.784 --> 03:41.316
Has anybody ever told you how
incredibly beautiful you are?

03:41.422 --> 03:44.189
Never. Could you excuse us, please?

03:44.292 --> 03:46.661
Certainly you’d want me
by your side at this trial.

03:46.762 --> 03:49.826
I'm sure you’re very sweet,
but old men tend to die on me.

03:49.933 --> 03:54.341
I'm Denny Crane. No bigger ass
- asset.

03:54.437 --> 03:58.104
- You want me at your table.
- Look, we're sort of busy here.

03:58.210 --> 04:00.680
Seems like you're deliberately
challenging us to dislike you.

04:00.779 --> 04:04.446
Mr. Shore, the media has
painted me as the "Black Widow"...

04:04.549 --> 04:07.989
the gold digger who's poisoned
her 70-year-old rich husband.

04:08.087 --> 04:11.219
If they can prove I was having
an affair, I'll be hated.

04:11.324 --> 04:14.661
I'll be needing a jury to look beyond
the hatred and see that I'm innocent.

04:14.762 --> 04:18.327
I suppose I'm first looking for
an attorney who could do the same.

04:18.432 --> 04:22.203
I can. My God, you're sexy.

04:24.339 --> 04:26.401
How about you go back to your office?

04:26.509 --> 04:29.208
I'll have a pair of my pants delivered.

04:29.313 --> 04:32.981
- You can try and get in them on your own time.
- She's wicked.

04:33.084 --> 04:35.020
I love it.

05:07.490 --> 05:09.393
I think we can agree, the
last thing you need...

05:09.493 --> 05:13.058
is to be depicted in open
court as a sexual predator.

05:13.164 --> 05:15.192
I've already been
vilified as such, Shirley.

05:15.301 --> 05:18.137
Court represents my only
means to clear my name.

05:18.237 --> 05:20.333
Adam, while we may win this trial...

05:20.439 --> 05:22.876
we don't have the means
to prove your innocence.

05:22.976 --> 05:25.573
I f I settle this,
people will presume guilt.

05:25.679 --> 05:27.808
More importantly, my colleagues will.

05:27.915 --> 05:30.478
I'm a respected surgeon, for God's sake.

05:30.585 --> 05:32.555
I don’t jump out of alleys
to fondle people.

05:32.653 --> 05:38.257
Look, the district attorney
refused even to bring charges.

05:38.361 --> 05:40.263
That tells you how ridiculous
this whole thing is.

05:40.363 --> 05:42.891
There's a higher burden of proof
in criminal cases. This is civil.

05:42.999 --> 05:45.733
All she needs to establish
is a preponderance of evidence.

05:45.836 --> 05:48.273
- If she’s convincing in her
testimony- - How can she be?

05:48.373 --> 05:51.904
- The woman is mute.
- I beg your pardon?

05:52.010 --> 05:54.573
The plaintiff can’t speak. She's mute.

05:54.679 --> 05:56.843
- It's in the file.
- So it's my word...

05:56.949 --> 06:00.981
my truthful word,
against her lying a Mdavit.

06:01.088 --> 06:04.288
Opposing counsel is
coming in this afternoon.

06:04.392 --> 06:08.298
- If I can make this go away- - She has
to walk away. I'm not giving her a dime.

06:10.198 --> 06:12.796
- He knew about your affair?
- Yes.

06:12.902 --> 06:14.804
The only rule he had was
for me to be discreet.

06:14.904 --> 06:16.965
Which you weren't.

06:18.408 --> 06:21.313
And your boyfriend Justin-

06:21.412 --> 06:24.009
- Ex-boyfriend. We're no
longer together. - Mmm.

06:24.115 --> 06:27.144
- That pleases you?
- I t does.

06:29.721 --> 06:32.591
Why don’t you talk to him? I'll
pay a visit to the housekeeper.

06:32.691 --> 06:36.358
- And, Denny- - I'll
look after Kelly.

06:36.463 --> 06:38.866
I can see you’re aroused.

06:38.965 --> 06:43.806
You might consider the last man to
make love to her died while doing so.

06:46.074 --> 06:48.409
I'll take my chances.

06:55.651 --> 06:59.717
You two will sit at the table, offer the
appearance of a formidable defense team...

06:59.823 --> 07:04.425
thereby suggesting that Walter Edmunds has
this firm's full resources at his disposal.

07:04.529 --> 07:06.465
Garrett, plaintiffs
interrogatory responses.

07:06.564 --> 07:09.537
Review them. Know them
before the deposition.

07:09.635 --> 07:11.628
Sara, I want you to
research whether or not...

07:11.737 --> 07:14.538
a civil rights claim can even
exist absent state action.

07:14.641 --> 07:18.411
- Oh, I'll need your memo by noon.
- Mr. Lewiston has me on the Sheppard closing.

07:18.513 --> 07:21.212
Right. Now you’re off it. Go.

07:21.315 --> 07:23.445
I'll talk to Mr. Lewiston.

07:23.551 --> 07:26.045
Denise?

07:26.154 --> 07:29.787
- Tim. - You,
uh-You got a second?

07:29.893 --> 07:31.954
Actually, no. Is it important?

07:32.061 --> 07:34.794
- Well,
um- - What?

07:34.899 --> 07:37.700
I didn't want to have a
process server deliver-

07:39.703 --> 07:41.605
I thought I should at least, um-

07:41.706 --> 07:43.699
You're filing for divorce?

07:43.808 --> 07:46.872
Well, it's not something we
both didn't, you know, expect.

07:46.979 --> 07:50.180
I just- Look,
as a courtesy-

07:50.284 --> 07:53.951
- You wanted to see my expression?
- It wasn't that. Denise-

07:54.054 --> 07:57.084
It's fine. I appreciate the courtesy.

07:57.191 --> 07:59.058
look. look, we both-

07:59.160 --> 08:02.497
I'm really busy, Tim. We'll
talk about this later, okay?

08:02.597 --> 08:06.231
Sure. Yeah.

08:16.280 --> 08:19.310
I'll expect you to know every one
of those interrogatories by 1:OO p. m.

08:37.371 --> 08:41.211
We could argue that her complaint gives
rise to a defamation claim against her.

08:41.309 --> 08:43.303
I doubt that would fly.

08:43.412 --> 08:46.385
Sorry I'm late, people.

08:46.483 --> 08:50.356
Extraordinary thing, that Big Dig.

08:50.455 --> 08:52.152
Malcolm Holmes, Tara-

08:54.258 --> 08:56.889
What?

08:56.995 --> 09:00.025
Tara and I are, um, already acquainted.

09:00.132 --> 09:03.628
- Acquainted?
- Well, that's what we say in England.

09:03.736 --> 09:06.037
In America, you'd probably say...

09:06.139 --> 09:09.374
I'm the reason she went to law school.

09:09.477 --> 09:12.917
- She's the one who got away.
- What are you doing in Boston?

09:13.014 --> 09:17.046
I finally know. You let your hair grow.

09:17.152 --> 09:18.985
I hate to break up the tea party, but-

09:19.088 --> 09:22.322
Careful. We're still a bit thin-skinned
on that one. Such a waste of proper tea.

09:22.426 --> 09:28.098
How is it that I just get older and
you seem to get more... magnificent?

09:28.198 --> 09:30.761
How about nest, we
address settling the case?

09:30.869 --> 09:33.432
Ah. I have no interest in settling.

09:33.539 --> 09:37.206
We fully intend to see this through.

09:37.309 --> 09:40.578
- Well, you do so at your own peril.
- Do I?

09:40.681 --> 09:44.382
Once we establish your client’s claim as
baseless, our client has instructed us...

09:44.485 --> 09:46.421
to pursue a defamation
claim against Miss Bradley.

09:46.521 --> 09:48.651
Suddenly, her house could be in play.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.919
- I'm not sure we want that.
- Vey impressive.

09:51.025 --> 09:53.087
You might advise her of that as well.

09:53.195 --> 09:56.726
You have an opposing counsel who will stop
at nothing to impress an old boyfriend.

09:56.832 --> 10:00.397
Given that I don't
believe in coincidences...

10:00.504 --> 10:03.944
I'd like to take this opportunity to say
what's needed to be said for some time.

10:05.376 --> 10:07.745
We...

10:07.845 --> 10:11.216
have no intention of settling.

10:13.486 --> 10:16.618
Here's the motion. I'll
see you both in court.

10:23.698 --> 10:28.664
It was extremely pro-Christian. There
were Bible sessions, Christian hymns.

10:28.770 --> 10:32.871
As anew, I found it increasingly
more and more oppressive.

10:32.975 --> 10:35.776
- So you quit?
- It was more like I was forced out.

10:35.878 --> 10:37.940
The office took on
such a Christian tone.

10:38.048 --> 10:41.180
- So you quit?
- I felt ostracized as anew.

10:41.285 --> 10:43.916
Alienated. I was forced out.

10:44.021 --> 10:46.424
I have many Jewish friends who
miss going to morning shun...

10:46.525 --> 10:49.520
so they've started forming minions
at the office during their lunch hour.

10:49.629 --> 10:52.362
- Are you saying that that's wrong?
- There's a difference.

10:52.465 --> 10:55.437
- Tell me the difference, Mr. Abrams.
- Jews are a minority.

10:55.536 --> 10:58.633
And minorities enjoy civil
rights that the majority doesn't?

10:58.739 --> 11:01.176
When we talk about the rights
of minorities in this county...

11:01.275 --> 11:03.108
we're addressing the evil of oppression.

11:03.211 --> 11:07.676
When you say to a Christian society that it's
okay to start celebrating your religion...

11:07.784 --> 11:10.517
openly and notoriously
in the workplace...

11:10.620 --> 11:12.853
you run the risk of fostering
that vey oppression.

11:12.955 --> 11:15.791
- I began to feel oppressed.
- So you just quit the marriage?

11:17.995 --> 11:19.965
The job.

11:29.074 --> 11:32.570
I've worked in this
household for 37 years.

11:32.679 --> 11:35.618
I was the closest thing that man
had to family for the last 1 O...

11:35.716 --> 11:38.517
and that includes her.

11:38.619 --> 11:41.022
By her, you mean Kelly Nolan?

11:41.122 --> 11:44.584
The way she treated him, parading
her boyfriend around in the house-

11:44.694 --> 11:48.395
If I may ask, how is it that...

11:48.498 --> 11:51.994
you still live here
and Kelly Nolan doesn't?

11:52.101 --> 11:54.698
I mean, it is her house, isn't it?

11:54.806 --> 11:58.302
She says it brings her
too much pain to live here.

11:58.410 --> 12:02.180
The memory other husband
dying in her arms.

12:02.280 --> 12:05.549
I guess the memory of lacing his
wine with nitro isn't as haunting.

12:07.119 --> 12:09.021
What makes you think she did that?

12:09.121 --> 12:11.319
I know he wasn't suicidal.

12:11.425 --> 12:15.890
I know she stood to inherit. I know they
argued, and he threatened to disinherit her.

12:15.997 --> 12:19.368
She certainly knew he'd be taking
Viagra if they were going to make love...

12:19.468 --> 12:21.700
which they almost never did, by the way.

12:21.804 --> 12:24.139
Prefect. Slip him a little nitro.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.211
What a deadly combination.

12:26.309 --> 12:30.079
You seem to have a
finely-tuned sense of delivery.

12:30.180 --> 12:32.378
Having lived in the same house
with her for seven years...

12:32.483 --> 12:35.650
I know she's a cold, detached... person.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.887
She's capable.

12:49.436 --> 12:52.500
- She's lying. He never threatened to disinherit me.
- Why would she say that?

12:52.607 --> 12:55.602
I don't know. He never threatened
to cut me out of the will.

12:55.710 --> 12:58.342
If she says that she heard as
much two days before he died-

12:58.447 --> 13:02.444
And let me tell you, the housekeeper
has considerable dramatic flair.

13:02.552 --> 13:05.524
- We cannot let that woman take the stand.
- How do we stop it?

13:05.622 --> 13:08.823
- Bring a motion Jasmine. It's hearsay.
- My last lawyer tried that.

13:08.927 --> 13:13.198
Well, we try again. francs Staler
cannot get in that witness chair.

13:22.542 --> 13:25.515
There they are!

13:25.613 --> 13:29.053
Denny Crane. She loves
me. She loves me not.

13:29.150 --> 13:31.553
Denny Crane.

13:31.653 --> 13:34.820
It's a last-minute motion
designed to waste the court's time.

13:34.924 --> 13:37.691
A week before the trial, I have
no interest in wasting time.

13:37.794 --> 13:41.530
Mr. Shore, all motions were to be
filed 10 days ago by order of this court.

13:41.632 --> 13:44.969
Now, I must admit that I am new to
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts...

13:45.069 --> 13:46.971
but I like to stick to my schedules.

13:47.071 --> 13:52.014
Of course. Why bother with justice
when there's a day planner involved?

13:52.110 --> 13:55.311
I realize attorneys in
Massachusetts are fond of sarcasm.

13:55.414 --> 13:58.581
You should know I spent most of
my years on the bench in Los Angeles.

13:58.685 --> 14:00.814
And if a lawyer talks back
to a judge in Los Angeles-

14:00.921 --> 14:04.088
He's shot, probably on the freeway.
Can we get back to the justice part?

14:04.191 --> 14:08.600
Justice is not served by preventing
a material witness from testifying.

14:08.697 --> 14:10.599
It's hearsay evidence.

14:10.699 --> 14:13.500
The only thing the housekeeper has to
offer would be what the deceased told her.

14:13.602 --> 14:15.436
As to what the deceased
told Mrs. Stadler...

14:15.538 --> 14:19.000
these were statements made in an excited
state, an exception to the hearsay rule.

14:19.109 --> 14:22.378
- How can you establish that?
- 5he will establish that on the stand.

14:22.480 --> 14:25.418
- Which brings us to her bias.
- The court is allowing the testimony.

14:25.517 --> 14:28.010
Your Honor, this is a murder case.

14:28.120 --> 14:31.024
We once had a notion in this
county that the rules of evidence...

14:31.123 --> 14:34.392
would be strictly constructed and
interpreted in favor of the defendant.

14:34.494 --> 14:38.093
There's a reason for that. It's to protect
against the incarceration of the innocent.

14:38.198 --> 14:41.865
- There sits an innocent woman.
- I have made my ruling, counsel.

14:41.970 --> 14:44.908
Miss Stadler may testify. We
are adjourned. That's all.

14:53.215 --> 14:55.983
Sorry. Hug?

14:57.822 --> 14:58.325
A cello?

14:58.326 --> 15:01.728
Your Honor, my client is
entitled to her day in court.

15:01.826 --> 15:04.933
And how are we supposed to
understand what she's saying?

15:04.934 --> 15:06.132
We have her affidavits.

15:06.231 --> 15:08.998
Plus, as it happens, I speak cello.

15:09.101 --> 15:11.265
Mr. Holmes, this is a serious matter.

15:11.371 --> 15:14.468
I assure you, I find nothing
humorous about a sexual assault.

15:14.574 --> 15:16.477
And you don't think it's trivialized...

15:16.577 --> 15:18.706
by putting her up there
with a musical instrument?

15:18.813 --> 15:21.752
My client is mute. That
should not prevent her...

15:21.850 --> 15:25.381
from getting in the witness chair and
expressing herself to her best ability.

15:25.487 --> 15:27.981
Miss Schmidt, I don't see
how it prejudices anything.

15:28.091 --> 15:33.866
- You're not serious?
- We'll begin tomorrow morning, 1 O:OO.

15:33.964 --> 15:36.458
We're adjourned.

15:38.036 --> 15:42.307
Oh, um, a few small
administrative matters.

15:42.407 --> 15:46.109
Are you involved? Tell me
over dinner. Not to worry.

15:46.212 --> 15:50.016
She won't give you
away, you naughty man.

15:54.354 --> 15:57.122
I began to notice that
many of our employees...

15:57.225 --> 16:00.095
were engaged in borderline
unethical conduct...

16:00.194 --> 16:03.565
be it nondisclosure,
conflict of interest.

16:03.665 --> 16:06.968
I didn't like it. Add to that...

16:07.070 --> 16:10.875
there seemed to be
evidence of some moral decay.

16:10.975 --> 16:12.638
- Moral decay?
- Yes.

16:12.743 --> 16:15.614
There was adultery going on interoffice.

16:15.714 --> 16:21.181
There just seemed to be a
bankruptcy of values, if you will.

16:21.286 --> 16:23.348
And we ultimately came
to the conclusion that...

16:23.456 --> 16:26.827
people aren't bringing their
spirituality to work with them.

16:26.927 --> 16:30.264
So you scheduled interoffice prayer
sessions in a financial brokerage firm?

16:30.364 --> 16:34.533
It had nothing to do with pushing
any specific religious agenda.

16:34.636 --> 16:36.538
- Did you discuss this with
in-house counsel? - Of course.

16:36.638 --> 16:37.431
What did they say?

16:37.432 --> 16:39.634
Well, they said that there
were some risks involved.

16:39.742 --> 16:42.840
- But I felt strongly enough- - Objection.
That's privileged. Do not answer.

16:42.946 --> 16:45.383
I believe he began answering the
question, thereby waiving privilege.

16:45.482 --> 16:48.010
The witness will not
answer the question.

16:53.859 --> 16:57.994
Your role was to sit at the
table. It was not to speak...

16:58.097 --> 17:02.094
it was not to object, and it was not
to issue directives to the client.

17:02.203 --> 17:04.400
I thought he was about to
reveal privileged information.

17:04.503 --> 17:07.772
I will decide whether to object
or not. Do you understand me?

17:07.875 --> 17:11.748
- You weren't listening.
- What did you say?

17:11.846 --> 17:15.217
I saw your face.
You weren't even paying attention.

17:15.317 --> 17:17.413
- That's why I jumped in.
- Is that how you practice law?

17:17.520 --> 17:22.554
You read faces? Garrett it would
be a mistake to try to read mine.

17:25.429 --> 17:28.664
It won't happen again.

17:30.702 --> 17:32.673
Garrett.

17:38.344 --> 17:40.907
I apologize.

17:43.516 --> 17:45.885
You were right to object.

17:45.987 --> 17:48.185
I was asleep at the wheel.

17:48.289 --> 17:51.319
And I'm out offline to be venting on you.

17:51.426 --> 17:54.193
It's okay.

17:54.296 --> 17:58.830
Obviously, I overheard
- with your husband.

17:58.936 --> 18:04.073
My husband and I were
over a long time ago.

18:04.175 --> 18:07.045
But with his filing, I-

18:09.048 --> 18:12.510
I just don't like to fail at things.

18:15.088 --> 18:19.393
Again, I shouldn't be taking
it out on you. I apologize.

18:22.797 --> 18:27.136
- So what comes next?
- I-I beg your pardon?

18:27.236 --> 18:31.644
In the case. What comes next?

18:31.740 --> 18:36.513
We have a settlement conference
scheduled during which...

18:36.613 --> 18:40.109
I need to make a convincing showing as
to why they should accept a small number.

18:40.217 --> 18:43.384
But what that showing is escapes me.

18:43.487 --> 18:46.255
I have no idea.

18:52.065 --> 18:54.366
What do you think you’re doing?

18:57.771 --> 18:59.901
I just-

19:00.008 --> 19:04.416
You looked
- I'm sorry.

19:04.512 --> 19:07.917
I realize that men see a
vulnerable woman as an opportunity.

19:08.017 --> 19:11.252
- I guess the boys do as well.
- It wasn't that, I promise.

19:11.355 --> 19:13.257
I was just offering consolation.

19:13.358 --> 19:17.128
Thank you. I'm fine.

19:17.228 --> 19:19.392
Okay.

19:20.999 --> 19:23.732
Well, good-bye then.

19:29.843 --> 19:33.408
- I didn't kill my husband.
- Somebody killed him, Kelly.

19:33.513 --> 19:36.144
Accidental overdose
will be very hard to sell.

19:36.251 --> 19:39.314
The capsule was emptied
into the wine glass.

19:39.420 --> 19:41.823
Who takes nitro that
way? Somebody killed him.

19:43.326 --> 19:46.230
Why aren’t you pointing a finger?

19:46.329 --> 19:50.270
- Or at least asking questions?
- I think he took his own life.

19:50.367 --> 19:52.270
By inducing a heart attack?

19:52.370 --> 19:54.841
There's got to be a more fun way.

19:54.939 --> 19:56.966
I think he wanted to frame me.

19:57.075 --> 20:00.537
We argued about my affair.
He vowed to get even.

20:00.645 --> 20:02.639
I think he did.

20:05.919 --> 20:09.552
It's like she's emotionally flat lined.

20:09.656 --> 20:13.995
She speaks with no affect. I tm’s-I
tm’s-I tm’s an associative disorder.

20:14.095 --> 20:17.626
That's what it is. She cannot
reconcile herself with what she's done...

20:17.733 --> 20:20.500
so she emotionally lobotomizes herself.

20:20.602 --> 20:22.800
If I could just get one whiff other-

20:22.906 --> 20:26.846
Catherine, mark up a motion for a continuance
in the Nolan case and file it immediately.

20:26.943 --> 20:29.278
Ah! I knew it! You need more time.

20:29.380 --> 20:32.842
You're in trouble!
She did it, didn't she?

20:36.822 --> 20:41.993
He seems to take particular delight
in all this, does he not, Catherine?

20:42.094 --> 20:46.594
We all do. It's fun to
see pretty people fall.

20:48.001 --> 20:49.995
Your little boyfriend is twisted.

20:50.104 --> 20:53.703
Trust me when I tell you
he's not finished killing.

21:12.364 --> 21:15.200
- Would I like him?
- Probably not.

21:15.301 --> 21:17.601
You'd admire his sense of humor.

21:17.703 --> 21:21.108
- Do you see you two getting married?
- Probably not.

21:21.208 --> 21:23.337
You see us two getting married?

21:23.444 --> 21:25.677
Probably not.

21:29.617 --> 21:33.251
This is why I shouldn't drink,
I suppose. Double scotch, please.

21:33.356 --> 21:35.326
Yes, sir.

21:36.792 --> 21:41.131
- You know, your client is guilty.
- Says you.

21:41.231 --> 21:43.532
Concert cellists don't lie.

21:47.473 --> 21:50.070
Come on.

21:50.175 --> 21:54.640
One kiss, hmm? Let's get it over with.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.048
I'll see you in court, Malcolm.

22:17.141 --> 22:19.111
Indeed.

22:27.453 --> 22:29.822
How dare you come in here
and seek a continuance!

22:29.922 --> 22:32.587
Your Honor, we need to
conduct an investigation...

22:32.692 --> 22:35.129
having incorrectly assumed
that the police had done one.

22:35.228 --> 22:39.363
Mr. Shore, this-this woman is
trying to manipulate this process.

22:39.467 --> 22:41.995
- I will not be manipulated.
- Mad cow.

22:42.103 --> 22:45.133
Silence!

22:45.240 --> 22:49.010
She likely fired her last attorney
because she told him she did it.

22:49.111 --> 22:52.016
And since he can't knowingly put a
witness in the chair to commit perjury...

22:52.115 --> 22:55.555
which is her plan, she was forced to retain
new counsel and keep them in the dark.

22:55.652 --> 22:57.953
And now, we have you... and you.

22:58.055 --> 23:00.822
If this woman wishes to
manipulate me in the dark-

23:00.925 --> 23:02.155
- Denny.
- Silence!

23:02.260 --> 23:05.130
- The eyes.
- Quiet!

23:05.230 --> 23:08.032
This trial will start next week.

23:08.134 --> 23:11.129
Judge, notwithstanding your
tightly-corseted mind...

23:11.238 --> 23:14.871
no defendant in a murder case
can get a fair trial...

23:14.975 --> 23:17.572
with an attorney who has had
less than a week to prepare.

23:17.678 --> 23:19.238
You're wasting my time, counsel.

23:19.347 --> 23:22.343
And to the detriment of Miss
Nolan, you are wasting yours.

23:22.451 --> 23:26.084
Your request for a
continuance is denied.

23:27.990 --> 23:31.726
- You think she's hot for you?
- I didn't say hot. I said interested.

23:31.828 --> 23:32.743
You're delusional.

23:32.744 --> 23:35.131
First of all, she made
it a point to tell me...

23:35.233 --> 23:37.135
how she was long over her husband.

23:37.235 --> 23:39.900
- What does that- - And
second, she gave me the look.

23:40.005 --> 23:40.516
What look?

23:40.517 --> 23:43.638
The look that you can't describe
but you know when you get it.

23:43.742 --> 23:46.339
- Get what?
- The look.

23:46.446 --> 23:50.547
Two associates huddled? Someone
better be getting billed.

23:53.521 --> 23:56.653
Settlement conference is at 4:OO.

23:56.757 --> 23:58.728
No talking.

24:03.866 --> 24:07.431
Now, Miss Bradley...

24:07.538 --> 24:12.379
I am armed with your affidavit, and
the judge has permitted me to lead.

24:12.477 --> 24:15.644
But in your own way...

24:15.747 --> 24:18.776
I'd like you to tell us
what happened that night.

24:20.820 --> 24:23.986
You were headed home.

24:24.091 --> 24:26.961
It was a delightful spring night.

24:27.060 --> 24:28.962
Parents walking with their children.

24:29.062 --> 24:33.060
It seemed so innocent, blissful...

24:33.167 --> 24:36.903
which is perhaps the
reason why you felt safe...

24:37.005 --> 24:40.638
in taking a shortcut through an alleyway.

24:40.744 --> 24:42.611
It was dark. Suddenly-

24:50.589 --> 24:54.154
And suddenly, a man was coming.

24:54.259 --> 24:56.856
That man! And he grabbed you.

24:56.962 --> 25:00.596
You were terrified. He molested
you. He fondled your breast.

25:00.701 --> 25:04.300
It was awful. You will
never get overt, ever.

25:06.940 --> 25:09.503
Thank you. Your witness.

25:20.157 --> 25:22.958
- Objection!
- Miss Bradley!

25:26.097 --> 25:28.967
Miss Bradley, you said that
it was dark that night...

25:34.407 --> 25:36.878
You said that the entire incident...

25:40.815 --> 25:43.582
All five seconds in the dark?

25:53.763 --> 25:56.200
Thank you.

26:00.772 --> 26:03.505
Miss Bradley!

26:12.117 --> 26:15.922
Blow that one up. No, that one.

26:16.022 --> 26:18.049
Blow it up.

26:19.227 --> 26:21.129
She's perfect.

26:21.229 --> 26:24.361
- Oh, my God.
- What's going on?

26:27.903 --> 26:30.066
- What's going on?
- Nothing, dear.

26:30.173 --> 26:32.075
We were just looking at naked pictures...

26:32.175 --> 26:34.942
of your client fornicating
in her swimming pool.

26:35.044 --> 26:38.449
- Okay, everyone out, please.
- Yes. Everyone out, now!

26:38.549 --> 26:41.112
Out! Terrible. Now!

26:41.219 --> 26:43.280
Out!

26:44.690 --> 26:46.626
Problem. You got a Web site, Kelly.

26:46.726 --> 26:48.719
What do you mean?

26:48.829 --> 26:52.097
Would this be Justin Murray?

26:52.199 --> 26:54.830
- Where did these come from?
- Point is, they're everywhere now.

26:54.935 --> 26:57.998
- They were posted this morning.
- Can we trace the source?

26:58.105 --> 27:00.976
- I doubt it. We could try, but-
- I think I know who took these.

27:01.075 --> 27:05.608
There's a person, a boy in
my neighborhood. Fifteen, 16.

27:05.714 --> 27:10.089
Willis Berger. At times, I
thought he was stalking me.

27:10.186 --> 27:14.423
- Stalking you?
- I'd be at the salon, and I'd see him in the window.

27:14.525 --> 27:17.862
I would be shopping. He'd
show up at the market.

27:17.962 --> 27:22.461
We briefly hired him to do
some odd jobs around the house...

27:22.567 --> 27:25.597
until we had to fire him
because he was just too bizarre.

27:25.705 --> 27:28.268
Do you know where this
Willis Berger lives?

27:28.374 --> 27:31.347
Yes.

27:31.445 --> 27:33.848
I'm going to mark up a
motion to change venue.

27:33.949 --> 27:36.318
If those images reach
our jury pool, it'll kill us.

27:36.418 --> 27:40.553
Why don’t you pay a visit to this
Willis Berger, see what's there.

27:40.656 --> 27:42.717
We could try for a search
with a court order.

27:42.825 --> 27:44.762
I don't think we’ve
got enough to get one.

27:44.861 --> 27:46.956
Brad, I need for you to
use your imagination here.

27:47.063 --> 27:50.902
Get your hands dirty if you have
to. Let me start by mussing up

27:51.001 --> 27:53.370
Oh, good God. It doesn't muss.

27:55.708 --> 27:58.703
Get what you can on this kid.

28:00.279 --> 28:02.181
Look at me, Kelly.

28:04.784 --> 28:07.017
This may be a break.

28:09.357 --> 28:11.350
Disgusting.

28:20.336 --> 28:24.071
I was out for a walk. It was
a beautiful spring evening.

28:24.173 --> 28:27.875
I went for walk. Suddenly,
police cars screech up.

28:27.979 --> 28:30.542
They grab me, haul me into a lineup.

28:30.648 --> 28:33.051
She points her cello wand at me.

28:33.151 --> 28:35.884
And now, here I am on trial
for something I never did.

28:35.988 --> 28:38.186
You never encountered this woman?

28:38.290 --> 28:41.262
- Certainly not!
- Thank you, sir.

28:46.901 --> 28:51.240
- Mr. Holmes?
- Oh. Yeah, sorry.

28:51.339 --> 28:54.403
Such a beautiful woman, your attorney.

28:54.510 --> 28:57.483
It is quit aedicule to work
in such close proximity...

28:57.580 --> 29:00.450
without wanting to give
her a little squeeze.

29:00.550 --> 29:03.283
- Objection!
- Sustained.

29:03.386 --> 29:05.289
Now, tell me, Doctor...

29:05.389 --> 29:09.490
how old were you when you
started playing doctor?

29:09.594 --> 29:12.566
- Objection!
- Sustained. Move for costs.

29:12.664 --> 29:15.262
Mr. Holmes, just for fun, let me
sustain or overrule the objections.

29:15.368 --> 29:16.962
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

29:17.071 --> 29:21.638
So, Doctor, you said you were
out taking a walk that night.

29:21.742 --> 29:24.475
- Yes.
- Sir, when you were picked up by police...

29:24.579 --> 29:27.015
that was almost three
miles from where you live.

29:27.115 --> 29:31.750
Were you deliberately walking in an area far away
from where you live so as to avoid suspicion?

29:40.597 --> 29:43.263
I don't understand his strategy.

29:43.367 --> 29:46.203
He seems to be trivializing his
whole case with this nonsense.

29:46.304 --> 29:48.206
What's his plan here?

29:48.307 --> 29:52.407
His style is to get the jury to
like him, which they always do.

29:52.512 --> 29:57.511
- And they usually give him what he asks for.
- How do I rattle him?

29:57.618 --> 30:00.454
- Malcolm Holmes doesn't rattle.
- Oh, come on, Tara.

30:00.554 --> 30:03.025
You slept with the man. You've
got to give me some insight.

30:03.125 --> 30:05.186
Slept with what man?

30:05.293 --> 30:08.733
Oh.

30:08.831 --> 30:12.703
Opposing counsel is
someone I used to date.

30:15.572 --> 30:18.909
- I thought I told you.
- I think you didn't.

30:19.010 --> 30:22.313
Really? Probably because
he's an old boyfriend...

30:22.413 --> 30:24.680
who didn't mean anything
then, and still doesn't.

30:26.719 --> 30:29.088
I thought I told you.

30:29.188 --> 30:31.249
I think you didn't.

30:38.533 --> 30:41.164
Laurie Berger?

30:41.269 --> 30:43.740
- Yes?
- Do you have a son, Willis Berger?

30:43.839 --> 30:47.370
- What's wrong? What's happened?
- I'm investigating a potential crime.

30:47.476 --> 30:50.278
If I had the authority to reveal it
was with the F. B. I., I would say so.

30:50.380 --> 30:52.908
But until certain security
clearances are satisfied...

30:53.017 --> 30:55.181
I'm not officially at
liberty to tell you anything.

30:55.286 --> 30:59.090
As far as you're concerned, you never heard
me say I'm with the f. B. I., which I'm not.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.094
I need to speak with
your son immediately...

31:01.194 --> 31:04.132
and I think you would like to arrange
that before others speak with him.

31:04.229 --> 31:06.723
- I'm sure you know what I mean.
- What's he done?

31:08.135 --> 31:10.037
Take me to your son, ma'am.

31:12.239 --> 31:15.109
Hello, Willis. I'm not F. B. I. You got
that? You never heard me say F. B. I.

31:15.210 --> 31:17.306
Do any blogging today?
Get away from the computer.

31:17.412 --> 31:20.111
- Why?
- Step away from the computer, son.

31:24.087 --> 31:25.989
- I-I was just looking.
- Looking, or posting?

31:26.089 --> 31:29.585
- Willis!
- I was just looking'.

31:29.693 --> 31:32.757
- That's your neighbor Kelly Nolan.
- So?

31:32.863 --> 31:35.836
That's why I'd be curious, right? Naked
pictures of a neighbor on a Web site?

31:35.934 --> 31:37.767
Who wouldn't look?

31:37.869 --> 31:41.070
Mm-hmm. What's that there?

31:41.174 --> 31:45.912
Where did you get those, Willis?

31:55.790 --> 31:57.623
First offal, he wasn't
forced to participate.

31:57.726 --> 31:59.720
If the whole once is reading
the Book of Genesis, they

31:59.829 --> 32:01.924
- He chose to quit.
- Forced out.

32:02.031 --> 32:05.437
- Found other employment.
- Less money. Come on, Denise.

32:05.535 --> 32:08.473
Do you really wanna let a jury have a go
at this? Oppression is a dirty word.

32:08.572 --> 32:11.203
Remember, we're the county
that likes to root it out.

32:11.308 --> 32:11.308
This isn't the time to be anti-American.
Do I really need to say that?

32:13.778 --> 32:14.769
This isn't the time to be anti-American.
Do I really need to say that?

32:16.081 --> 32:18.917
Actually, the American government...

32:19.019 --> 32:22.355
tells us to be quite open with our
religion, especially the Christian kind.

32:22.455 --> 32:25.325
- Does it now? - Jimmy
Carter was a born-again Christian.

32:25.425 --> 32:28.796
Ronald Reagan said his
favorite book was the Bible.

32:30.464 --> 32:32.366
May I?

32:34.503 --> 32:37.908
- May I?
- Please.

32:40.643 --> 32:45.348
- We are guided by a power larger than ourselves.
- Jesus Christ, the son of God.

32:47.118 --> 32:51.081
- I just want to-do God's will.
- We are on God's side.

32:51.190 --> 32:54.185
- When you turn your heart and your
life- - I say a prayer before I pitch.

32:54.293 --> 32:56.024
over to Christ-

32:56.128 --> 32:57.928
- God knows the truth-
- when you accept Christ-

32:58.031 --> 32:59.830
- in a man's heart-
- it changes your heart.

32:59.933 --> 33:01.994
What does the Lord require of thee?

33:02.102 --> 33:04.734
- My friends, together we
can do this. - And to walk-

33:04.839 --> 33:06.171
- Do it we
must. - humbly-

33:06.274 --> 33:08.177
- So help me God.
- with thy God.

33:08.277 --> 33:12.115
I did not have sexual
relations with that woman.

33:12.214 --> 33:15.312
- Whoops.
- How is this relevant?

33:15.417 --> 33:17.319
It's relevant because...

33:17.420 --> 33:20.358
the open, notorious celebration of
Christianity has never been more popular.

33:20.457 --> 33:22.393
We have an evangelical president.

33:22.493 --> 33:24.588
John Ashcroft was a former preacher.

33:24.695 --> 33:26.597
Condoleezza Rice was
once a Bible teacher.

33:26.697 --> 33:28.725
The Air Force Academy has
basically established...

33:28.834 --> 33:30.964
evangelical Christianity
as its official religion.

33:31.070 --> 33:34.201
The football coach there put up a
banner that says, "Team Jesus Christ. "

33:34.307 --> 33:36.403
Have you checked the pulse
of this county lately?

33:36.509 --> 33:39.106
- How is this relevant?
- I just told you.

33:39.213 --> 33:41.616
It's evolution out, creationism in.

33:41.715 --> 33:44.620
We are a Christian nation.
He's making me repeat myself.

33:44.719 --> 33:47.954
With the eroding values in our county,
with high school kids turning to drugs...

33:48.057 --> 33:52.431
not to mention oral sex, with our
star athletes doped up on steroids...

33:52.528 --> 33:56.663
or committing sexual assaults, with the Enron’s
and WorldCom’s stealing from their investors...

33:56.767 --> 33:59.500
what is wrong with today's business
leaders tying to introduce...

33:59.603 --> 34:02.576
a little spirituality
into the workplace?

34:02.673 --> 34:05.805
- One nation under God.
- One nation under God.

34:05.911 --> 34:08.507
- One standard under God.
- One people under God.

34:08.614 --> 34:11.484
- For the children of God.
- The Lord is my life!

34:11.583 --> 34:13.679
- I have, uh, accepted Christ.
- God.

34:13.786 --> 34:15.780
- Praise to my lord and
savior. - God. - Jesus Christ.

34:15.889 --> 34:17.290
- And Christ Jesus.
- With God-

34:17.391 --> 34:18.985
- God- - Through
Christ- - God bless-

34:19.092 --> 34:21.428
- Christ. -
God. - Jesus.

34:21.529 --> 34:24.797
I did not have sexual-

34:28.538 --> 34:30.974
We are a Christian nation, Mr. Cone.

34:31.074 --> 34:33.944
When Martin Luther King
said, "free at last"...

34:34.043 --> 34:36.514
it was, "God almighty, free at last. "

34:36.612 --> 34:40.212
This is whose are. We are a
Christian nation. And this-

34:40.318 --> 34:42.846
this is our time.

35:03.912 --> 35:05.849
- I can't believe you did that.
- It just came to me.

35:05.949 --> 35:08.819
She almost fired you for objecting
at the depot, and then you filibuster-

35:08.918 --> 35:12.221
- I didn't filibuster.
I was only- - Garrett?

35:12.323 --> 35:15.262
After I specifically
told you not to talk...

35:15.360 --> 35:18.332
what would possibly possess you to
put on a show-and-tell like that?

35:18.430 --> 35:20.333
Sometimes you have to take chances...

35:20.433 --> 35:24.373
in life, in law, in love.

35:27.374 --> 35:30.175
Incredibly, you had some effect.

35:30.277 --> 35:32.714
The plaintiffs
reconsidering another counter.

35:32.813 --> 35:37.188
- And with you.
- I'm sorry?

35:37.286 --> 35:41.557
You're a senior associate. Satisfying
you is important to me as well.

36:10.024 --> 36:12.120
- No comment.
- Denny Crane.

36:12.227 --> 36:16.726
She's having my baby. Denny Crane.

36:16.831 --> 36:20.431
- A change of venue?
- These images are graphic.

36:20.537 --> 36:22.439
They're all over the Internet.

36:22.539 --> 36:25.671
I'm sure you've seen them, Judge. The
potential jury pool would be contaminated-

36:25.776 --> 36:29.511
- Mr. Shore, I'm not happy.
- Gee. And up till now, you've seemed so tickled.

36:29.614 --> 36:31.607
This is dilatory. That's what this is.

36:31.716 --> 36:34.985
Your Honor, this woman is
entitled to a fair trial.

36:35.087 --> 36:37.786
She's entitled to
be judged by objective jurors-

36:37.890 --> 36:41.159
If these images are on the Internet,
they probably wouldn’t be limited...

36:41.261 --> 36:44.132
to the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, and you know that, sir.

36:44.231 --> 36:46.998
Your Honor, at this time, I
must ask that you refuse yourself.

36:47.101 --> 36:50.700
- On what grounds?
- Because you’re the real killer and everybody knows it.

36:50.806 --> 36:53.003
Step up here, counsel!

37:01.986 --> 37:04.787
You have mistyped, and you
are egregiously mistaken...

37:04.888 --> 37:08.293
if you think you will insult
this court without consequence.

37:08.393 --> 37:11.525
And you are mistaken if you think
you're going to push me around.

37:11.631 --> 37:13.533
I hated bullies on the
playground when I was six.

37:13.634 --> 37:17.665
I tolerate them no better on the bench
in my 40s. This is a murder trial.

37:17.770 --> 37:20.538
I've got the whole world
predisposed against my client.

37:20.642 --> 37:24.047
I will not allow the presiding judge
to be added to that list.

37:24.145 --> 37:27.550
- I am a faired impartial jurist.
- Then start acting like one.

37:27.650 --> 37:29.586
You are in contempt.

37:29.685 --> 37:33.648
So as not to prejudice your case or
client, I will suspend punishment.

37:33.756 --> 37:38.256
J As soon as this trial concludes
you're going into lockup.

37:38.362 --> 37:40.993
In the meantime, your motion
for a change of venue is denied.

37:54.648 --> 37:58.521
It may be too late
to get another lawyer.

37:58.620 --> 38:01.490
Maybe not, though.

38:01.589 --> 38:06.123
Obviously, I haven't exactly
hit it off with this judge.

38:06.228 --> 38:09.394
Perhaps you should go elsewhere.

38:09.499 --> 38:11.401
I'll stay.

38:14.071 --> 38:17.704
- I think you know.
- I know?

38:19.010 --> 38:22.745
That I'm innocent. The
way you fought in there.

38:24.316 --> 38:27.687
Don't kid yourself. I'm
the ultimate mercenary.

38:27.786 --> 38:30.314
I put myself on the
line for $500 an hour.

38:31.891 --> 38:34.385
It's that simple.

38:34.495 --> 38:36.932
I don't believe you.

38:40.135 --> 38:42.128
You know.

38:45.908 --> 38:48.812
In the matter of Bradley versus Carter...

38:48.911 --> 38:51.144
on the count of sexual batty...

38:51.248 --> 38:54.779
we find in favor of... the defendant.

38:54.885 --> 38:57.756
- Yes.
- Oh, bollocks!

38:57.856 --> 39:02.161
- Do over, Judge?
- You can try your luck with the appeals court, counsel.

39:02.261 --> 39:04.424
We're adjourned.

39:04.531 --> 39:07.765
- Thank God.
- Congratulations, Adam. You stuck to your guns.

39:07.867 --> 39:10.270
Thank you. Thank you, Tara.

39:10.370 --> 39:13.172
You're perfectly welcome.

39:21.451 --> 39:25.619
- Everything okay?
- Fine.

39:25.723 --> 39:29.823
Well, loser has to jump the net.
So I suppose dinner's on me.

39:29.927 --> 39:32.455
I am not having dinner with you.

39:32.564 --> 39:35.798
- Tara?
- See you tomorrow.

39:37.235 --> 39:39.365
I'm, uh, not one to offer advice...

39:39.472 --> 39:44.745
but if you’re really serious about this, um,
Alan fellow, you don't want to lose him...

39:44.844 --> 39:47.338
at least, by God, be able
to offer the excuse...

39:47.447 --> 39:49.816
that you simply had too
much wine for dinner.

39:49.917 --> 39:51.887
- Hmm?
- Excuse for what?

39:51.986 --> 39:55.892
Excellent. I love a woman
who makes no apologies.

39:57.693 --> 40:00.598
- Let's go.
- I'm not going anywhere with you.

40:00.697 --> 40:05.766
No? Then why is your hand in mine?

40:15.480 --> 40:18.008
I'll have dinner.

40:18.116 --> 40:19.848
That's it.

40:19.953 --> 40:22.891
Of course.

40:39.108 --> 40:43.847
That was quite something
with the judge today, Alan.

40:43.947 --> 40:46.282
Yes, it was.

40:47.418 --> 40:50.219
Dream case, isn't it?

40:50.322 --> 40:52.588
High-profile, splashy.

40:52.691 --> 40:56.325
Big closing. Get the "not guilty. "

40:56.429 --> 40:59.664
Have sex with the
client. It's all there.

40:59.767 --> 41:03.070
Hmm. Do you think she knows
I want to sleep with her?

41:03.170 --> 41:08.409
She probably assumes all men
do, maybe even some of the women.

41:08.510 --> 41:11.779
Mmm.

41:11.881 --> 41:14.284
Savor it, my friend.

41:16.052 --> 41:20.893
- Sorry?
- This case.

41:20.991 --> 41:24.863
The noise, the jeers, the circus.

41:24.962 --> 41:26.865
Savor it.

41:41.048 --> 41:45.650
- She didn't do it.
- What?

41:45.754 --> 41:48.955
She didn't kill her
husband. She's innocent.

41:49.058 --> 41:51.962
Really?

41:53.864 --> 41:57.634
Well, that's good. Makes
her less interesting...

41:57.735 --> 42:00.731
but that's
- that's good.

42:00.839 --> 42:03.367
It's also pressure, Denny.

42:04.911 --> 42:07.747
We've got an innocent client.

42:11.417 --> 42:14.652
This is going to be a ride.

42:23.866 --> 42:25.996
Yes, it is.
