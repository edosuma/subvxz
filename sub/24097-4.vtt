00:12.200 --> 00:16.280
The car hit the elk and went off the road.
There were drugs everywhere.

00:16.360 --> 00:20.360
-How did Tommy get mixed up in this?
-He saw us from the car.

00:20.440 --> 00:22.360
So he came over and asked for a cut.

00:23.760 --> 00:26.480
<i>This doesn't strike me as a man
<i>who's about to commit suicide.</i></i>

00:26.560 --> 00:29.840
You can make the wound look
like an accident, right?

00:32.080 --> 00:34.360
-What are we looking for?
-Stab wounds.

00:34.440 --> 00:37.400
Whether someone's taken
blood from the body.

00:37.480 --> 00:38.960
What about this?

00:39.040 --> 00:41.400
The screwdriver you stabbed Tommy with
needs to come out of the river.

00:41.480 --> 00:44.440
You said it'd be over by now!

00:46.440 --> 00:47.320
Lars?

00:48.760 --> 00:53.040
I've received a video
that implicates Ove Dreyer.

00:53.120 --> 00:57.320
Pay attention when he comes out.
It looks like he's taken something.

00:58.520 --> 01:02.560
-Where's Ove?
-The less you know, the better.

01:02.640 --> 01:07.240
<i>I think he has a Swedish girlfriend.
<i>He's been calling this number excessively.</i></i>

01:07.320 --> 01:10.720
<i>Tommy Hagen's blood was dead
<i>when it hit the fence.</i></i>

01:10.800 --> 01:14.120
-So it was planted?
-It looks that way.

02:27.920 --> 02:33.080
BORDERLINER

02:34.800 --> 02:36.600
<i>I've found Ove Dreyer.</i>

02:39.280 --> 02:41.040
<i>Nikolai?</i>

02:41.120 --> 02:43.200
Good. Where?

02:43.280 --> 02:45.520
At a caravan site just across the border.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.080
The blood on the fence was planted.

02:47.160 --> 02:51.160
<i>Maybe that's why Ove Dreyer
<i>was in the autopsy room the other day.</i></i>

02:51.240 --> 02:53.080
I tried to get authorization,

02:53.160 --> 02:56.120
but the Swedish police
need an arrest warrant from you.

02:56.200 --> 02:59.280
Give me five minutes to get dressed.

02:59.360 --> 03:02.160
-I'll call you when I'm on my way.
-<i>Okay.</i>

03:02.240 --> 03:03.840
Great.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.480
-Yes?
<i>-I'm on my way.</i>

03:42.640 --> 03:44.240
<i>How did you find him?</i>

03:44.320 --> 03:50.400
<i>He's been calling this Swedish girl,
<i>so I followed her here.</i></i>

03:50.480 --> 03:55.360
<i>He's obviously up to something.
<i>I'm sure he wasn't completely honest.</i></i>

03:55.440 --> 04:00.800
<i>-Does he know you're there?
<i>-No. I'm waiting for authorization.</i></i>

04:00.880 --> 04:02.560
<i>Keep me posted.</i>

04:10.040 --> 04:13.080
Hi, sweetie.

04:13.160 --> 04:17.920
-Hi. Look who's here.
-Hi, kid.

04:21.760 --> 04:24.440
There's juice and biscuits down the hall.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.720
You think bringing them here
was a good idea?

04:35.280 --> 04:36.920
Anniken found Ove.

04:37.880 --> 04:41.280
She knows the blood on the fence
was planted, and she thinks he did it.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.240
He'll break if he's interrogated.

04:43.320 --> 04:46.200
I'll deny everything,
and there's no proof.

04:46.280 --> 04:51.120
You'll still be in the spotlight.
You get that, right?

04:51.200 --> 04:53.120
The divers will be
searching the river today.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.760
They won't find anything.

04:54.840 --> 04:57.600
Of course they will.
They're diving in broad daylight.

04:59.560 --> 05:04.400
I think we should
prepare to admit defeat here.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.880
Daddy, would you like some juice?

05:10.840 --> 05:16.480
Your dad's tired. We'll let him rest.
You can sleep here. Let's get you to bed.

05:18.440 --> 05:21.720
I'm going down to the station
to get an arrest warrant for Anniken.

05:23.520 --> 05:24.520
Niko?

05:27.440 --> 05:28.960
I'm sorry.

05:44.160 --> 05:47.640
-Good night, kids.
-Good night.

06:13.040 --> 06:17.040
He was supposed to be
on a southbound bus in three hours.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.680
What an idiot.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.560
-What do we do about him?
-There's nothing we can do.

06:25.640 --> 06:29.520
Let's just hope he keeps you
and Lars out of it, but I doubt it.

06:29.600 --> 06:32.800
-We have to do something.
-Anniken's watching him!

06:40.000 --> 06:42.080
We'll have to prepare him.

06:44.720 --> 06:48.240
You don't want your number
on his phone when he's arrested.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.840
Oscar-Delta, over.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.520
<i>Hello?</i>

07:04.600 --> 07:07.920
Stay away from the fucking windows.

07:09.280 --> 07:10.720
The police are watching you.

07:18.520 --> 07:24.280
-Okay, what do I do?
-Prepare to be arrested and questioned.

07:24.920 --> 07:30.080
<i>Forget it. What's going on here?
<i>Are you trying to frame me, Bengt?</i></i>

07:30.160 --> 07:35.160
-Can you be quiet for three seconds?
-No! I'm sick of you ordering me around.

07:35.240 --> 07:38.040
I haven't done anything, I just want out!

07:38.120 --> 07:42.680
Give me one good reason
why I should listen to you.

07:42.760 --> 07:46.200
I'm not going to lie to the police.

07:57.800 --> 08:01.360
Ove? Ove!

08:04.280 --> 08:05.400
<i>Ove?</i>

08:23.360 --> 08:25.880
I'm emailing it to you now.
Please confirm when you've received it.

08:25.960 --> 08:30.280
<i>-Sure, will do.
-Great. Thanks so much.</i>

08:30.360 --> 08:32.960
<i>-No problem. Bye.
-Bye.</i>

08:35.120 --> 08:37.320
POLICE

08:57.640 --> 09:00.920
-Hi. Bengtsson.
-Larsen. Hi, Larsen.

09:39.240 --> 09:42.080
We're with the police.
We're looking for Ove Dreyer.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.600
He's not here.

09:43.680 --> 09:45.280
Can we come in?

09:51.360 --> 09:56.560
-He's not up here.
-Search the area near the main road.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.240
-Be honest. Where is he?
-I don't know.

09:59.320 --> 10:02.200
-Where was he going?
-I don't know.

10:37.920 --> 10:40.440
How long have you
been seeing each other?

10:41.960 --> 10:43.720
Six months or so.

10:45.960 --> 10:50.600
-Why do you meet here?
-It's a nice place, don't you think?

10:54.960 --> 10:58.320
Your boyfriend is
a suspect in a murder case.

11:01.280 --> 11:04.920
You'll be brought in
for questioning at the station.

11:06.440 --> 11:10.520
And depending on
what happens with Ove,

11:10.600 --> 11:13.600
it might be necessary
to take you into custody.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.880
Ove called me yesterday,
saying he was here.

11:18.960 --> 11:22.640
I came here, we fell asleep,
and when I woke up, he was gone.

11:25.360 --> 11:28.880
-Is that all?
-Yes.

11:33.640 --> 11:37.680
The girlfriend claims
she doesn't know where he is.

11:37.760 --> 11:42.120
<i>There was a bus headed for Malmö and
<i>Copenhagen that left a few minutes ago.</i></i>

11:42.200 --> 11:45.760
<i>-Are you tailing it?
-No, the Swedes are.</i>

11:45.840 --> 11:48.480
I'm heading back
after I've checked something.

11:49.960 --> 11:54.520
Okay. We'll be here
awaiting developments. Bye.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.840
<i>This is Anniken Høygaard-Larsen.</i>

13:01.920 --> 13:07.160
<i>I would like a forensic search
<i>of Ove Dreyer's houseboat ASAP.</i></i>

13:07.240 --> 13:12.120
Yeah, as soon as possible. Great, bye.

13:38.760 --> 13:40.840
This is Nikolai Andreassen.

13:42.480 --> 13:44.960
Bengt...

13:45.040 --> 13:47.280
Yes, that's correct.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.080
This is Anniken.

13:53.160 --> 13:54.960
<i>Hi, it's Nikolai. Where are you?</i>

13:55.040 --> 13:58.840
-I'll be there in ten minutes.
<i>-The hospital called. Ove's at work.</i>

13:59.560 --> 14:01.280
Bengt and I are on our way.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.880
Let's just meet up at the station later.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.640
<i>-Okay, I'll see you there.
-Great, bye.</i>

14:25.080 --> 14:27.080
Ove Dreyer?

14:30.080 --> 14:32.720
Come with us, please.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.600
-Okay. Why?
-We'll explain later.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.520
Hands where we can see them.

14:45.280 --> 14:48.720
-What's he doing here?
-Relax, he's in on it.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.160
He's in on it?
What the fuck does that mean?

14:51.240 --> 14:54.880
-Stop it.
-Stop it? I haven't done anything!

14:56.760 --> 15:00.280
Why were you
in the autopsy room Sunday night?

15:00.360 --> 15:02.880
Since you claim
you haven't done anything.

15:02.960 --> 15:05.400
Tommy was my friend.

15:05.480 --> 15:10.440
I went in there
to see him one last time.

15:10.520 --> 15:13.120
You were in there twice.
Before and after me.

15:15.080 --> 15:19.280
I didn't want to get caught.
I'm not supposed to go in there.

15:19.360 --> 15:22.120
Then I heard someone,
so I went to go hide.

15:22.200 --> 15:26.320
But I left my phone in there,
so I had to go back in and get it.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.560
Why did you put your phone down?

15:33.720 --> 15:39.400
Because you need both hands
to push the body into the mortuary fridge.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.760
That's why I put my phone down.

15:44.400 --> 15:49.320
Okay. We'll have to brief you on
a few things Anniken is going to ask you.

15:49.400 --> 15:54.080
Going into the autopsy room is one thing.
Why you were in Sweden is another.

15:54.160 --> 15:57.840
-I was visiting Malin.
-At a caravan site?

15:57.920 --> 16:02.560
She's living with her parents.
It's complicated.

16:02.640 --> 16:05.640
It's Anniken. We have to go.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.400
-I can't do this.
-You'll be fine.

16:09.480 --> 16:14.600
You came back to work. That's good.
It looks like you have nothing to hide.

16:14.680 --> 16:18.320
We'll continue this in the car.
We'll go through it one more time.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.760
Ove.

17:17.960 --> 17:19.600
Hey, Ove.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.280
Relax.

17:22.360 --> 17:25.880
Just do your best.
That's all anyone's asking.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.240
Everything will be fine.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.800
Do you think it will be fine?

17:43.760 --> 17:47.640
-We have no other choice.
-No.

17:55.480 --> 17:57.120
He fooled you, at least.

18:05.920 --> 18:07.600
What's this?

18:07.680 --> 18:09.760
What do you think he was doing
in the autopsy room?

18:09.840 --> 18:11.520
He told me to tape you.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.600
I don't think you'll fool Anniken.

18:20.720 --> 18:25.240
-What?
-You won't fool Anniken, unfortunately.

20:16.160 --> 20:19.000
0-2, this is Hotel 3-0.

20:19.080 --> 20:22.400
Detainee Ove Dreyer pulled a gun,
we had to use weapons.

20:22.480 --> 20:25.840
He is dead. We need assistance, over.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.640
<i>Ove Dreyer is dead.
<i>We need assistance immediately.</i></i>

20:31.720 --> 20:33.200
<i>Copy that. We're on our way.</i>

20:36.960 --> 20:40.800
Niko, listen to me.

20:40.880 --> 20:44.680
For fuck's sake, calm down!

20:44.760 --> 20:48.120
Calm down!

20:48.200 --> 20:50.920
You know he couldn't have
handled an interrogation.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.920
I had no choice, do you understand?

20:56.560 --> 20:58.120
Okay?

20:59.080 --> 21:01.800
We all would've gone down.
This was the only solution.

21:03.400 --> 21:07.600
He cooperated when we detained him.
He pulled a gun in the car.

21:08.840 --> 21:13.640
He told us to let him go.
He seemed really fucking desperate.

21:13.720 --> 21:16.680
I had no choice. That's what happened.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.200
Fuck...

21:29.880 --> 21:33.680
As long as we stick to this story,
it will all be over soon.

21:40.040 --> 21:41.720
This can end here!

21:45.960 --> 21:48.680
No one has to see that tape!

21:51.920 --> 21:53.400
Think!

21:58.360 --> 22:00.200
I'm not covering this up.

22:12.920 --> 22:15.960
Nikolai, wait here
until the second car arrives.

22:16.040 --> 22:19.520
Stay away from each other
until you've spoken to Internal Affairs.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.600
He ran away in the middle of the night.

23:38.680 --> 23:41.800
He must've seen me
and escaped through a window.

23:43.040 --> 23:47.040
He probably thought it seemed
less suspicious if he went back to work.

23:47.120 --> 23:51.720
Then you arrive and arrest him.
He pulls a gun and is shot and killed.

23:51.800 --> 23:57.200
-Just as I'm about to interrogate him.
-I agree. I know some things don't add up.

23:57.880 --> 24:02.560
If you have any suspicions,
talk to Internal Affairs.

24:04.280 --> 24:08.720
But I can't ruin my testimony
by discussing this case with you now.

24:10.280 --> 24:11.400
Okay.

24:15.680 --> 24:20.280
I've been told that I'm in charge
of the investigation for the time being.

24:20.360 --> 24:22.720
But I guess that's just a formality.

24:22.800 --> 24:26.360
If the divers don't find anything today,
everything will point to Ove.

24:44.520 --> 24:47.080
Ready? Let's go.

26:48.720 --> 26:54.760
For your information, you're both
suspended pending investigation.

26:54.840 --> 26:57.600
We'll try to protect and support you.

26:58.520 --> 27:03.600
It's voluntary, but I recommend speaking
to a lawyer before the interrogation.

27:04.280 --> 27:05.760
I'll pass.

27:05.840 --> 27:08.160
Andreassen?

27:14.440 --> 27:16.520
Yes, please.

27:16.600 --> 27:20.160
-Bengt Skare, we'll start with you.
-Sure.

27:25.880 --> 27:27.320
<i>Nikolai.</i>

27:28.640 --> 27:30.320
Nikolai?

27:31.240 --> 27:32.760
Nikolai?

27:33.960 --> 27:35.600
Your lawyer is here.

27:45.280 --> 27:46.880
How are you doing?

27:50.640 --> 27:52.480
Tell me what happened.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.960
They said someone was shot.

27:57.200 --> 28:00.840
That you were in the car
when a police officer shot a suspect.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.640
Look at me.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.320
It's me.

28:25.960 --> 28:29.440
I told you to come here because
I thought I needed a lawyer, but...

28:29.520 --> 28:30.560
I'm not so sure anymore.

28:30.640 --> 28:33.680
-What...
-I can't get you involved in this.

28:33.760 --> 28:36.960
It would put you
in an impossible position.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.240
I'm sorry, you have to leave.

28:41.040 --> 28:43.600
I rescheduled my whole day
to come here.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.160
Sorry.

28:46.240 --> 28:49.160
No, that's not what I meant.

28:50.400 --> 28:54.840
I'm not leaving just yet.
I'll stay until after the interrogation.

29:25.720 --> 29:27.520
Hi, Janne, it's Nikolai.

29:29.200 --> 29:33.240
I was just wondering
if those divers found anything?

29:38.640 --> 29:39.640
Okay.

29:40.720 --> 29:42.200
Thanks.

29:52.960 --> 29:57.880
<i>Interrogation of Bengt Skare,
<i>Tuesday, March 21st, 2:23 PM.</i></i>

29:58.720 --> 30:02.720
Tell me what happened,
from your point of view.

30:03.240 --> 30:04.680
He didn't resist in any way.

30:05.480 --> 30:07.800
When we were driving to the station,
he pulled a gun.

30:09.120 --> 30:15.080
He was waving the gun around.
It was an extremely complicated situation.

30:15.160 --> 30:16.280
I did what I had to do.

30:18.040 --> 30:20.880
-So it was self-defense?
-Yes.

30:21.600 --> 30:24.680
It's an unregistered gun.
The serial number has been removed.

30:24.760 --> 30:28.320
Do you have any idea where he got it?

30:28.400 --> 30:33.440
No, but Ove Dreyer probably had contacts
that could get him a gun.

30:33.520 --> 30:38.160
-So he was known to the police?
-Yes, he had priors.

30:54.080 --> 30:55.760
<i>Nikolai...</i>

30:57.040 --> 30:59.920
<i>We're just trying
<i>to figure out what happened.</i></i>

31:00.000 --> 31:02.720
<i>Yeah, I understand.</i>

31:06.000 --> 31:13.000
<i>The apprehension was unproblematic.
<i>He was cooperative.</i></i>

31:13.080 --> 31:15.600
<i>Easy to handle.</i>

31:15.680 --> 31:19.800
<i>To me, he seemed
<i>a bit baffled by the arrest.</i></i>

31:19.880 --> 31:24.000
-Did he say anything?
-He asked why he was being arrested.

31:24.080 --> 31:26.160
Other than that, he was quiet.

31:29.880 --> 31:33.680
And then we left the hospital, and...

31:34.600 --> 31:38.280
After about five minutes...

31:40.200 --> 31:43.280
-He pulled a gun.
-Who?

32:04.240 --> 32:06.040
Ove Dreyer.

32:07.960 --> 32:11.840
What do you think of sheriff Skare's
assessment of the situation?

32:13.320 --> 32:16.560
The situation was very chaotic.
He had no other choice.

32:38.800 --> 32:40.040
Thanks.

33:13.760 --> 33:16.720
-I'll be right back.
-Sure.

33:26.680 --> 33:29.960
Hi. Hi, Milla.

33:32.080 --> 33:36.480
I went to see your dad today.
He's doing much better.

33:36.560 --> 33:39.720
He told me to say hi to you both.
He's coming home tomorrow.

33:39.800 --> 33:43.440
-Can you read us a book?
-I can, but it's getting late.

33:43.520 --> 33:47.040
Why don't you go find a book
and get ready for bed?

33:47.120 --> 33:50.000
-I'll be there soon.
-Okay.

33:54.360 --> 33:56.480
-Is that okay?
-That's great.

33:57.920 --> 33:59.920
Yeah...

34:00.000 --> 34:04.480
-So Lars is better?
-Yes, he's better.

34:05.720 --> 34:09.640
Good. Isn't it a little strange
to go diving so late at night?

34:11.800 --> 34:16.000
We had to.
The mooring was coming loose.

34:17.520 --> 34:19.000
What?

34:20.360 --> 34:22.240
Who's that in the car?

34:24.360 --> 34:26.000
A lawyer.

34:26.080 --> 34:29.160
-A lawyer?
-Yes.

34:29.240 --> 34:32.000
Yours? Or for Lars?

34:33.200 --> 34:35.960
No, it has nothing to do with Lars.

34:37.280 --> 34:42.160
It's work-related.
I should get the kids to bed.

34:43.480 --> 34:45.400
I'll stay at the hotel tonight.

35:04.120 --> 35:07.440
I'll know what the divers found tomorrow.

35:07.520 --> 35:10.120
There was no match there anyway.

35:11.320 --> 35:15.160
I didn't find Ove's DNA on Tommy's body,
but he could have been wearing gloves.

35:19.160 --> 35:21.640
Tommy weighed 120 kilos.

35:21.720 --> 35:26.360
Ove would have had to be really strong
to do something like that.

35:27.480 --> 35:30.000
What does Nikolai think?

35:31.160 --> 35:33.240
Who knows?

35:34.320 --> 35:36.040
What do you mean?

35:38.320 --> 35:40.240
That I don't know what Nikolai thinks.

35:43.720 --> 35:45.280
Thank you.

35:58.720 --> 36:01.080
-This is Anniken.
<i>-This is forensics.</i>

36:01.160 --> 36:04.880
<i>We found something
<i>in Ove Dreyer's houseboat.</i></i>

36:44.840 --> 36:46.720
I've been thinking.

36:50.760 --> 36:56.520
It's one thing that we can only
be open about this with my family.

36:56.600 --> 36:59.920
That's fine. I don't mind that at all.

37:01.160 --> 37:06.240
But you and I can't keep secrets
from each other on top of that.

37:06.320 --> 37:07.800
That's not going to work.

37:13.520 --> 37:17.880
I hope you can tell me
what this is about some day.

37:33.280 --> 37:34.760
I...

37:36.120 --> 37:39.640
I'll tell you everything, I promise.

37:46.520 --> 37:48.240
Okay.

38:00.840 --> 38:05.280
-This is Skare.
<i>-Hi. Bente Ellevik from Internal Affairs.</i>

38:05.360 --> 38:06.760
Hi.

38:06.840 --> 38:09.960
<i>I just wanted to inform you that
<i>we have concluded our investigation</i></i>

38:10.040 --> 38:14.680
<i>and passed the case on to the legal
<i>department, but our position is clear.</i></i>

38:14.760 --> 38:16.440
Okay.

38:16.520 --> 38:20.920
<i>We're basing our investigation
<i>on two matching witness statements,</i></i>

38:21.000 --> 38:25.920
<i>so we recommend that the case is closed
<i>immediately and the suspensions lifted.</i></i>

38:26.000 --> 38:27.440
I see.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.080
Thank you.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.080
Looks like it will all work out.

38:47.080 --> 38:48.720
Hey...

38:53.960 --> 38:55.640
Come here.

39:05.800 --> 39:08.040
You're the sweetest person I know.

39:39.880 --> 39:42.080
-Hi.
-Hi.

39:50.760 --> 39:53.600
Did you see me? Outside?

39:57.400 --> 39:58.880
Yes.

40:02.720 --> 40:04.200
Yes.

40:09.560 --> 40:11.040
Okay.

40:16.320 --> 40:20.360
-I just heard. It went well?
-Yes.

40:23.160 --> 40:24.240
Are you coming back?

40:25.960 --> 40:28.080
-What...?
-After the suspension.

40:28.160 --> 40:31.920
-I thought we concluded that Ove had...?
-No. Ove didn't do this alone.

40:33.480 --> 40:35.360
There are more people involved, for sure.

40:35.440 --> 40:38.480
Someone who knew
we were investigating the wounds

40:38.560 --> 40:43.640
who either tipped Ove off, or used him to
steal blood from Tommy, and planted it.

40:44.680 --> 40:45.920
Internally?

40:47.440 --> 40:53.480
Most likely, and we did
a forensic search of Ove's boat...

40:53.560 --> 40:56.840
-Can we talk about this tomorrow?
-Absolutely.

40:57.360 --> 40:58.840
Good night.

41:37.320 --> 41:39.040
Good morning.

41:46.200 --> 41:49.000
We found this hidden at Ove's.

41:50.680 --> 41:53.480
Smuggled, isn't it?

41:53.560 --> 41:54.840
Looks like it.

41:55.840 --> 41:59.840
It appears he's been operating
on a larger scale than we thought.

42:00.880 --> 42:03.960
If anyone at the station has
been involved with the Tommy case,

42:04.040 --> 42:06.440
they may also have
been involved with smuggling.

42:08.880 --> 42:13.080
They want the names of everyone who was
at the briefing following Tommy's murder.

42:14.280 --> 42:17.200
And everyone who's been at the scene
must register their DNA.

42:19.840 --> 42:20.880
Okay.

42:20.960 --> 42:24.520
You can see what
you can find about this.

42:24.600 --> 42:26.360
I'll look into it.

42:27.120 --> 42:28.400
Welcome back.

42:59.360 --> 43:01.560
<i>She's not giving up, Lars.</i>

43:02.520 --> 43:05.760
It's only a matter of time
before they see the connection

43:05.840 --> 43:10.240
between Tommy, Ove, you and Bengt.

43:10.720 --> 43:13.840
-What the fuck do we do now?
-This was your problem.

43:16.280 --> 43:18.240
But I'm the one burning.

43:19.240 --> 43:20.920
What's the plan?

43:21.760 --> 43:24.080
I'm asking you: What's the plan?

43:24.160 --> 43:26.520
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

43:30.880 --> 43:35.880
I don't have a choice. In order to
keep Anniken away from you and the drugs,

43:35.960 --> 43:40.520
she needs some closure
on Tommy that she can believe.

43:42.080 --> 43:46.280
-I can only see one option.
-What?

43:49.680 --> 43:52.520
I have to tell them
that I killed Tommy Hagen.
