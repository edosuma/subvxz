at your friend, Annie.

There's some stuff
from her recent past

00:37.039 --> 00:38.472
that seems pretty suspicious.

00:38.507 --> 00:40.942
You have been hiding something
ever since you got back.

Now, I want the truth.

02:29.518 --> 02:31.919
I never pegged you for
a greasy spoon type of gal,

that is the best grilled cheese

earlier,

Did you find something?

02:54.309 --> 02:56.811
Did you know that
she has a medical condition?

02:56.845 --> 02:58.946
- No.

02:58.980 --> 03:01.248

wouldn't the agency
already know about it?

He was impressive.

No, not personally.

Ivan says Mueller asked him
to drain down his account

07:48.766 --> 07:52.268
and put the money onto prepaid
cash cards like these,

07:52.302 --> 07:54.704
which he then transferred to
a Russian courier,

07:54.738 --> 07:58.107
the same guy you saw him
talking to in the embassy.

07:58.142 --> 08:01.010
That means the courier
is en route to Mueller

11:02.059 --> 11:04.260
Deep pockets
make you an easy mark.

11:04.294 --> 11:07.463
People will sell you whatever
lies you're willing to pay for.

11:07.497 --> 11:09.498
You got a better idea?

11:24.581 --> 11:28.217
A teahouse is like a mob front
in Jersey.

11:30.187 --> 11:33.389
I say we bypass the associates
and go straight to the boss.

11:33.423 --> 11:36.459
How do you propose we do that?

11:36.493 --> 11:39.795
Sometimes the best solution
is the most obvious.

11:42.399 --> 11:44.700
Excuse me, uh...

11:44.735 --> 11:48.304
I'm looking for a Russian man
who passed through here

11:48.338 --> 11:50.706
some time in the last 24 hours.

12:14.297 --> 12:16.699
Look familiar?

12:20.103 --> 12:23.672
I was hoping maybe your boss
could help me.

12:23.707 --> 12:25.541
I thought that you were
supposed to be an expert

12:25.575 --> 12:26.642
in languages.
Yeah, well, you know

12:26.676 --> 12:27.877
how many dialects
they speak around here?

12:27.911 --> 12:29.779
Besides, I was trying
to make a scene.

12:29.813 --> 12:31.453
Well, I think you succeeded
in doing that.

12:33.750 --> 12:35.918
You, come.

12:39.790 --> 12:41.791
[Speaking native language]

13:00.777 --> 13:03.145
I hear you're looking for
the Russian.

13:03.180 --> 13:06.315
Yes.
I take it you've seen him.

13:06.349 --> 13:09.118
I have.

13:09.152 --> 13:11.487
It's not safe to travel
through these parts

13:11.521 --> 13:13.456
with valuables, you know.

13:15.826 --> 13:17.493
Where is he now?

13:20.664 --> 13:24.366
I slit his throat.

13:26.636 --> 13:28.904
He was asking
the wrong questions.

13:28.939 --> 13:31.807
What questions are those?

13:31.842 --> 13:36.512
He was looking for...

13:36.546 --> 13:39.615
Faruq Tabrizi.

13:43.120 --> 13:46.155
Just like you are.

13:52.251 --> 13:53.633
What do you want
with Tabrizi?

13:54.269 --> 13:55.869
He's an intruder here.

13:55.904 --> 13:59.373
We're not here on business,
like the Russian.

13:59.407 --> 14:01.742
We're here to take Tabrizi down.

14:08.350 --> 14:11.652
In that case...

14:11.686 --> 14:14.922
I won't stop you.

14:14.956 --> 14:17.624
Where can we find him?

14:17.659 --> 14:20.461
He and his men
move around a lot.

14:20.495 --> 14:22.930
But I've heard rumors lately
that he's in the <i>goy dere.</i>

14:22.964 --> 14:24.898
- <i>Goy dere...</i>
<i>- It's something</i>

14:24.933 --> 14:27.634
the northern Azeri people say,
not my dialect.

14:27.669 --> 14:29.536
But it means "The Blue Valley."

14:29.571 --> 14:31.872
- Where is that?
- The lowlands east of here

14:31.906 --> 14:33.240
are known for their
blue Puschkinia flowers

14:33.274 --> 14:34.541
in the spring.

14:34.576 --> 14:37.544
I can send one of my men
to guide you if you want.

14:37.579 --> 14:39.313
Thank you.

14:41.850 --> 14:45.319
Oh, if you do find him,

14:45.353 --> 14:47.755
you'd better put a bullet
in his head.

14:57.866 --> 15:00.534
Ivan's intelligence
proved to be reliable.

15:00.568 --> 15:02.803
The courier was, in fact,
en route to Nathan Mueller

15:02.837 --> 15:04.104
with the cash cards.

15:04.139 --> 15:06.006
What do we know about
Mueller's location?

15:06.041 --> 15:07.801
According to Annie's source,
he may be hiding

15:07.809 --> 15:09.376
in a remote valley,

15:09.411 --> 15:11.478
but the situation's
extremely volatile.

15:11.513 --> 15:13.313
The goal is still capture
and extraction,

15:13.348 --> 15:16.083
but we should be prepared for
all options moving forward.

15:16.117 --> 15:18.285
You want me to contact CTC
and NSC?

15:18.319 --> 15:21.422
Yeah. Start working
on securing their approvals.

15:21.456 --> 15:22.823
Thank you, everyone.

15:25.126 --> 15:26.360
Legal called back,

15:26.394 --> 15:28.328
and your 9:00 a.m.
got pushed to noon tomorrow.

15:28.363 --> 15:30.664
Also, there's a little snafu
at the Russian embassy.

15:30.698 --> 15:33.734
One of the diplomats
was arrested with a call girl.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.175
He'll be fine.
He's got immunity.

15:41.209 --> 15:42.543
Thanks for the update.

15:42.577 --> 15:44.778
Joan.

15:44.813 --> 15:48.315
Calder, we both know who
this woman is.

15:48.349 --> 15:51.919
I told you, Joan,
I'm past all that.

15:51.953 --> 15:54.021
Are you?

15:54.055 --> 15:57.024
Yeah.
I appreciate your concern, I do.

15:57.058 --> 15:59.426
And I'm sorry she got arrested,
but it's not my problem.

15:59.461 --> 16:02.830
I'm glad to hear that.
I think you dodged a bullet.

16:02.864 --> 16:04.998
Keep me posted on those
approvals.

16:05.033 --> 16:06.533
Will do.

16:40.902 --> 16:43.470
So this is the blue valley.

16:43.505 --> 16:46.507
It could take weeks to search
an area this size.

16:46.541 --> 16:48.375
We don't have weeks.
Mueller could move again

16:48.409 --> 16:49.676
before that.
Then we're gonna need

16:49.711 --> 16:51.678
a hell of a lot more boots
on the ground.

16:51.713 --> 16:53.580
This area isn't deserted.

16:53.615 --> 16:55.849
There's farmers
and shepherds here.

16:55.884 --> 16:57.050
It's not the ideal place
for someone

16:57.085 --> 16:58.752
looking to hide
in the shadows.

16:58.786 --> 17:00.387
What are you thinking?

17:00.421 --> 17:02.523
Hasad said Tabrizi
was in the <i>goy dere,</i>

17:02.557 --> 17:06.393
but he admitted
that wasn't his native dialect.

17:06.426 --> 17:09.262
<i>Goy</i> means blue,
but it also means sky.

17:09.297 --> 17:11.431
So maybe we're looking
in the wrong place.

17:13.601 --> 17:16.369
Is there a valley
past that mountain?

17:16.404 --> 17:17.871
What's beyond those peaks?
Valley, yes.

17:17.906 --> 17:19.339
No one go.
Too dangerous.

17:19.374 --> 17:21.608
Can you take us there?
No.

17:24.378 --> 17:26.579
Hasad said you'd help us
find Tabrizi.

17:26.614 --> 17:29.416
Okay, forget the guided tour.

17:29.450 --> 17:31.370
Maybe you can take us
to the base of the mountain

17:31.386 --> 17:33.554
and tell us the best way up.

17:38.459 --> 17:40.727
I guess those deep pockets
do come in handy.

17:40.762 --> 17:43.764
Well, sometimes the best
option is the most obvious.

18:08.823 --> 18:11.558
- Auggie.
- Tony.

18:11.593 --> 18:13.694
How's it going?

18:13.728 --> 18:15.829
It's good to see you.
Long time.

18:15.863 --> 18:17.431
How are things
at the state department?

18:17.465 --> 18:20.067
Uh, pretty good.
It's a little...

18:20.101 --> 18:21.935
little dry, though,
you know?

18:21.970 --> 18:25.239
It's not like the old days,
out in the field.

18:25.273 --> 18:27.374
Yeah,
that's why I called you.

18:27.408 --> 18:29.810
I wanted to talk to you about
Nate Mueller.

18:29.844 --> 18:32.312
Mueller?

18:32.347 --> 18:34.314
What happened?
He come back in?

18:34.349 --> 18:36.883
Believe me,
I'd tell you if I could.

18:36.918 --> 18:38.852
I know how close
you guys used to be.

18:38.886 --> 18:43.123
Yeah, he saved my ass back
in Kandahar and Darcheli.

18:47.095 --> 18:48.495
What do you want to know?

18:48.529 --> 18:52.799
You remember when he went
deep cover a couple years ago?

18:52.834 --> 18:55.669
Something was...off with him.

18:55.703 --> 18:57.671
He was under
a lot of stress.

18:57.705 --> 18:59.539
He was always under stress.
That was the job.

18:59.574 --> 19:01.842
But it never seemed to
get to him before.

19:01.876 --> 19:03.710
- He was tough.
- Yeah, exactly.

19:03.745 --> 19:06.713
So he wouldn't just go off
the grid for nothing, right?

19:11.085 --> 19:14.054
His wife left him.

19:14.088 --> 19:17.624
He had a kind of...
breakdown after that.

19:17.659 --> 19:20.861
- He never said anything.
- He hid it from the agency.

19:20.895 --> 19:22.929
I mean, hell, wouldn't you?
Yeah.

19:22.964 --> 19:25.966
He didn't want to
get pulled from the field.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.534
Yeah.

19:27.568 --> 19:29.803
He threw himself back in
twice as hard afterward.

19:29.837 --> 19:32.839
Beyond that,
who knows what happened?

19:35.009 --> 19:36.677
Do you really think
losing his wife

19:36.711 --> 19:38.378
was enough to radicalize him?

19:38.413 --> 19:40.280
May have been enough
to open the door.

19:40.315 --> 19:43.283
I think he blamed the Agency
for his relationship problems.

19:43.318 --> 19:44.851
That explains why he cut ties.

19:44.886 --> 19:46.420
And the more
he pushed people away,

19:46.454 --> 19:48.355
the less connected he was
to his old life.

19:48.389 --> 19:50.357
Eventually, he may have just
crossed a line

19:50.391 --> 19:52.626
he couldn't uncross.

19:52.660 --> 19:55.162
We have miles to go, so I'll
call you if we find anything.

19:55.196 --> 19:56.196
Yeah.

20:00.234 --> 20:01.868
Scout.

20:32.834 --> 20:36.503
[Heartbeat thumping]

20:36.537 --> 20:38.872
[Gasping]

20:56.051 --> 20:57.685
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

20:57.719 --> 20:59.253
- What do you need?
- Shit.

20:59.287 --> 21:00.688
What do you need?

21:00.722 --> 21:02.122
I got it.

21:02.157 --> 21:03.457
Shit!

21:03.491 --> 21:05.559
Must have been crushed
during your fight.

21:05.593 --> 21:07.594
- Uh-huh.
- Everything all right?

21:07.629 --> 21:09.596
Yeah, yeah, it's good.
Just check the perimeter.

21:09.631 --> 21:11.265
Just give us a moment.

21:11.299 --> 21:15.369
[Gasping, breathing hard]

21:15.403 --> 21:17.805
Okay.
Here, here, here.

21:17.839 --> 21:19.807
You ready?
Yeah.

21:19.841 --> 21:23.410
[Breathing hard]

21:25.647 --> 21:28.782
[Breathing slows down]

21:51.339 --> 21:52.940
You know, I was reading
some new studies

21:52.974 --> 21:55.442
where they're using
corticosteroids to...

21:55.477 --> 21:57.411
reduce inflammation
in myocarditis.

21:57.445 --> 22:00.914
I mean, it's not a cure-all,
but it sounded promising.

22:00.949 --> 22:04.351
You've been researching
my heart condition?

22:04.386 --> 22:07.688
Well, after Venezuela,
I did some reading up, yeah.

22:07.722 --> 22:11.325
They're still in
the testing phases, but...

22:11.359 --> 22:13.293
the results are promising.

22:15.563 --> 22:18.198
Thank you.
Sure.

22:27.642 --> 22:31.311
So what do you think happened
to Nathan Mueller?

22:35.850 --> 22:38.118
He lost his way.

22:38.153 --> 22:40.721
He was always a lone wolf.

22:42.190 --> 22:44.358
Maybe he didn't...

22:44.392 --> 22:46.927
Even realize
he'd strayed too far

22:46.961 --> 22:48.929
until it was too late
to turn back.

22:57.439 --> 22:59.339
We should go.

23:37.212 --> 23:39.046
[Cell phone rings]
Phone: Incoming call.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.614
Hayley.
Hayley.

23:40.648 --> 23:41.849
Hey, what's up?

23:41.883 --> 23:43.784
Myocarditis.
Ever heard of it?

23:43.818 --> 23:46.186
- Excuse me?
- It's a heart condition.

23:46.221 --> 23:47.488
Annie has it.

23:47.522 --> 23:49.656
I have no idea how she has
managed her symptoms,

23:49.691 --> 23:52.793
but it's dangerous for her
to be in the field.

23:52.827 --> 23:54.928
You have evidence
to back this up?

23:54.963 --> 23:56.730
Yes.
Honestly, Auggie,

23:56.764 --> 24:00.234
I feel bad for her,
but she lied.

24:02.604 --> 24:04.605
Yeah.

24:06.774 --> 24:10.677
If she were selling secrets
or working missions off-book,

24:10.712 --> 24:12.412
by all means,
I'd say blow the whistle.

24:12.447 --> 24:13.881
But something personal
like this,

24:13.915 --> 24:15.616
is it really that black
and white?

24:15.650 --> 24:18.886
So you're saying
look the other way.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.387
I trust Annie.

24:20.421 --> 24:22.341
And if you trust me enough
to tell me about this,

24:22.357 --> 24:25.359
my gut says you're conflicted
on what to do.

24:27.028 --> 24:29.296
Look, the CIA
might prefer not to know,

24:29.330 --> 24:31.632
but I have been tasked
by the DNI's office

24:31.666 --> 24:34.735
to report what I find,
so my job is on the line.

24:34.769 --> 24:36.670
I get that.

24:36.704 --> 24:37.971
I do.

24:38.006 --> 24:39.673
But Annie has been
working her ass off

24:39.707 --> 24:42.042
trying to find who's behind
the Chicago attack.

24:42.076 --> 24:43.810
And ultimately,
your investigation

24:43.845 --> 24:45.612
is about answering
the same questions.

24:45.647 --> 24:47.514
It seems like derailing her
right now

24:47.549 --> 24:51.952
only gets in the way
of what you both want.

24:51.986 --> 24:55.322
Well, I am in the middle of
analyzing the rest of the data.

24:55.356 --> 24:59.526
It might not hurt to refocus my
investigation into other areas,

24:59.561 --> 25:02.829
at least for now.

25:02.864 --> 25:05.265
I think you're doing
the right thing.

25:05.300 --> 25:07.467
I need to go.

25:07.502 --> 25:10.304
Coffee in the morning?
Sure.

25:10.338 --> 25:12.639
Call you later.

25:16.044 --> 25:17.605
- Got an update for Calder.
- I'm sorry.

25:17.612 --> 25:20.347
He's out of the office.

25:20.381 --> 25:22.449
Do you know
when he'll be back?

25:22.483 --> 25:24.017
I don't.

25:24.052 --> 25:25.519
But as soon as
he checks back in,

25:25.553 --> 25:27.588
I'll let him know
you stopped by.

25:27.622 --> 25:29.623
Yeah, please do.

25:42.937 --> 25:45.138
Thanks, Darryl.
I owe you.

25:46.741 --> 25:48.308
Can't say
I'm surprised to see you.

25:48.343 --> 25:51.178
I guess word travels pretty fast
in your circles.

25:51.212 --> 25:53.280
I thought you said
you knew how to be discreet.

25:53.314 --> 25:56.783
And I was, when I was being
deposed by the DNI's office.

25:56.818 --> 25:59.553
But being discreet doesn't mean
there's no risk involved

25:59.587 --> 26:01.388
in what I do.

26:01.422 --> 26:03.357
You were looking at up to two
years of possible jail time.

26:03.391 --> 26:04.491
That would've never happened.

26:04.525 --> 26:06.393
This was just a little
slap on the wrist.

26:06.427 --> 26:07.594
Slap on the wrist?

26:07.629 --> 26:09.196
You know how many strings
I had to pull

26:09.230 --> 26:11.465
to keep this off your record?
I never asked you to do that.

26:11.499 --> 26:12.633
I was trying to help you.

26:12.667 --> 26:15.636
No, you're trying to help
yourself.

26:18.740 --> 26:21.208
You know what?

26:21.242 --> 26:22.709
I'm done.

26:24.612 --> 26:27.347
I'm sick of waiting for the
other shoe to drop with you.

26:27.382 --> 26:30.417
And yet you're the one who
just can't seem to stay away.

26:30.451 --> 26:32.919
Good luck, Calder.
But don't call me again.

26:32.954 --> 26:34.588
Taxi!

26:53.975 --> 26:55.909
There.

26:55.943 --> 26:58.545
To the left,
just below that Ridge.

27:00.148 --> 27:01.314
That's got to be them.

27:01.349 --> 27:04.451
We have to get closer
to get a positive I.D.

27:04.485 --> 27:05.886
Whoa.

27:05.920 --> 27:12.025
There could be more scouts
down there.

27:13.628 --> 27:15.729
We'll meet back here
once we get a visual.

27:15.763 --> 27:17.898
Roger that, boss.

27:28.976 --> 27:30.644
Looks like they're packing up.

27:30.678 --> 27:33.413
If we wanna make a move,
now's the time to do it.

27:34.782 --> 27:37.384
That's him.
That's him.

27:39.220 --> 27:41.455
Yeah, that's Mueller.

27:43.224 --> 27:45.092
A breakdown?

27:45.126 --> 27:48.061
Was this before he was working
deep cover in Azerbaijan?

27:48.096 --> 27:50.697
Yeah. Essentially a year
before he broke ties with us.

27:50.732 --> 27:52.165
I made a few calls.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.234
I got my hands
on some redacted files.

27:54.268 --> 27:56.770
Should we loop Calder in
on this stuff?

27:56.804 --> 27:59.906
Um, I'm told he had
some important business

27:59.941 --> 28:01.842
to take care of
outside of the office.

28:01.876 --> 28:04.010
You can continue on.
One of Mueller's assets

28:04.045 --> 28:06.913
from that time, a guy
he was supposedly turning,

28:06.948 --> 28:09.649
was killed last year
in the Beirut attack.

28:09.684 --> 28:11.384
He was wearing the vest.

28:11.419 --> 28:14.287
He sent his former asset out
on a suicide mission?

28:14.322 --> 28:15.683
I don't think he turned
that asset.

28:15.690 --> 28:17.290
I think that asset turned him.

28:17.325 --> 28:20.227
So he was radicalized while
he was still in the field,

28:20.261 --> 28:22.496
which is why he left the Agency.
Yeah.

28:22.530 --> 28:25.766
I think Mueller was vulnerable
after his wife left him.

28:25.800 --> 28:28.769
He distanced himself
from everyone in his life.

28:28.803 --> 28:30.604
[Sighs]
Well, thanks, Auggie.

28:30.638 --> 28:32.339
This strengthens our case
against him.

28:32.373 --> 28:35.275
Joan, Auggie, what's the
latest on the Mueller situation?

28:35.309 --> 28:38.078
Auggie's just connected
some dots in Mueller's history.

28:38.112 --> 28:40.614
I have operative Walker
on the line.

28:40.648 --> 28:41.948
I'll patch her through.

28:41.983 --> 28:44.951
Annie, what did you find?
I have a positive I.D.

28:44.986 --> 28:46.820
On Mueller--we've got eyes
on the encampment.

28:46.854 --> 28:47.988
And how many guys
are with him?

28:48.022 --> 28:50.590
That's the problem.
15, maybe 20.

28:50.625 --> 28:51.758
We don't have
the kind of manpower

28:51.793 --> 28:54.294
to engage an extraction.

28:54.328 --> 28:55.729
What kind of weapons
are you seeing?

28:55.763 --> 28:58.365
Kalashnikovs, PKs,
some RPG launchers.

28:58.399 --> 28:59.966
Plus, he's packing up camp.

29:00.001 --> 29:01.668
We could follow him,
but it's dicey.

29:01.702 --> 29:03.003
We don't know
how many scouts he has.

29:03.037 --> 29:06.339
This could be our last chance
to engage and contact.

29:06.374 --> 29:09.342
It's time to move forward
with our termination plan.

29:09.377 --> 29:12.512
We're gonna issue
a drone strike.

29:12.547 --> 29:15.549
Calder, we don't know
with certainty

29:15.583 --> 29:17.450
that he's planning
another attack.

29:17.485 --> 29:18.718
But given Mueller's history

29:18.753 --> 29:20.687
and the close call
we had in Dar es Salaam,

29:20.721 --> 29:22.689
we have enough evidence to
believe

29:22.723 --> 29:25.058
that he poses
an imminent threat.

29:27.061 --> 29:29.162
I've secured
CTC and NSC approvals,

29:29.197 --> 29:30.931
and the White House
has signed off.

29:30.965 --> 29:32.532
How quickly can we have
a Reaper there?

29:32.567 --> 29:35.068
CTC already has one on standby
out of Incirlik.

29:35.102 --> 29:36.970
It can be there in 30 minutes.
Okay.

29:37.004 --> 29:39.105
Annie, unless
we hear from you again,

29:39.140 --> 29:40.574
the drone strike is a go.

29:40.608 --> 29:42.209
Copy that.

29:42.243 --> 29:43.543
We'd better get to
the command room.

29:43.578 --> 29:46.446
You, too, Auggie.
You should be there for this.

29:51.452 --> 29:53.119
[Whispering]
They're sending in a Reaper

29:53.154 --> 29:54.721
to take out the encampment
in 30 minutes.

29:54.755 --> 29:56.089
We should head
back up the mountain,

29:56.123 --> 29:57.757
resume our position
with the rest of the team.

29:57.792 --> 29:59.359
Let's hope that Mueller
doesn't get too far before then.

29:59.393 --> 30:00.560
Yeah.

30:02.763 --> 30:05.065
No move, no move.

30:06.234 --> 30:07.567
Guns.

30:16.110 --> 30:18.078
Go.

30:18.112 --> 30:20.347
American military support
is on its way.

30:20.381 --> 30:21.948
It's gonna be here---
uhh!

30:23.584 --> 30:26.419
Go, go.

30:26.454 --> 30:29.456
Okay.

30:30.591 --> 30:33.560
Okay, okay.

30:40.431 --> 30:41.738
How much time do we have?

30:43.958 --> 30:45.289
Seven minutes and 13 seconds.

30:45.414 --> 30:47.349
Any chance Langley's gonna
wait to hear from you

30:47.383 --> 30:49.351
before they strike?
The plan was to move forward

30:49.385 --> 30:50.685
unless I called back.

30:50.720 --> 30:53.154
Well, that's unfortunate.

31:07.770 --> 31:10.338
[Speaking native language]

31:14.343 --> 31:17.479
I'd like to speak
with our guests alone.

31:20.916 --> 31:23.084
- Bruce.
- Sir.

31:23.119 --> 31:25.120
- You have visual on the target?
- Not yet.

31:25.154 --> 31:27.656
- What's our ETA?
- We're six minutes out.

31:27.690 --> 31:29.090
Your strike package.

31:29.125 --> 31:31.993
Let's get the UAV command center
on the line.

31:32.028 --> 31:34.162
Has anyone double-checked
Annie's GPS signal

31:34.196 --> 31:35.830
to make sure
she's out of the blast radius?

31:35.865 --> 31:37.966
Looks like her phone
lost service 20 minutes ago,

31:38.000 --> 31:40.001
but that's not unusual
in those mountains.

31:40.036 --> 31:43.905
Her last known location
was well out of range.

31:43.939 --> 31:45.807
Why don't you stand over here.
Yeah.

31:48.310 --> 31:51.680
We don't get too many visitors
way up here.

31:51.714 --> 31:54.649
It's hard to find.

31:54.684 --> 31:57.719
So I'm gonna make
the next part easy.

31:57.753 --> 31:59.187
Nathan, listen to me.

31:59.221 --> 32:01.423
There is a Reaper
on its way here

32:01.457 --> 32:03.124
to take out this entire camp.

32:03.159 --> 32:05.026
Everybody here is gonna be
dead in a matter of minutes.

32:05.061 --> 32:06.261
If you let me use
my cell phone,

32:06.295 --> 32:07.996
I can call Langley
and have them hold off.

32:08.030 --> 32:09.597
But we don't have much time.

32:09.632 --> 32:13.134
I want you to explain
to the world

32:13.169 --> 32:15.870
how the American government

32:15.905 --> 32:18.406
glorifies its own crimes,

32:18.441 --> 32:20.642
and sends people like you
out here

32:20.676 --> 32:24.345
to commit state-sponsored
acts of terrorism.

32:26.415 --> 32:28.917
Who wants to go first?

32:28.951 --> 32:32.454
How about the big-shot CEO
of McQuaid Security?

32:32.488 --> 32:34.823
It's over, Nathan.
You're not gonna win this time.

32:34.857 --> 32:36.891
- Read the statement.
- Go to hell.

32:36.926 --> 32:40.328
I don't think you're gonna
like the other option.

32:45.601 --> 32:47.902
Visualizing position
of the target.

32:47.937 --> 32:49.404
Stand by.

32:51.273 --> 32:54.375
The target
is within missile range.

32:54.410 --> 32:56.544
2 minutes,
38 seconds to target.

32:56.579 --> 32:58.313
Any update
on Annie's coordinates?

32:58.347 --> 33:00.482
No, nothing.

33:00.516 --> 33:02.083
I'll go.

33:05.855 --> 33:08.990
A volunteer.

33:09.024 --> 33:12.093
Go ahead, introduce yourself,
read the statement.

33:12.128 --> 33:13.328
My name is Annie Walker.

33:13.362 --> 33:15.930
I studied the work you did
at the CIA.

33:15.965 --> 33:17.265
I used to admire you.

33:17.299 --> 33:19.567
Of course you did.
They told you I was a hero.

33:19.602 --> 33:20.969
Auggie Anderson told me that.

33:26.041 --> 33:29.210
Read the statement.

33:33.716 --> 33:35.216
We're ready, sir.

33:35.251 --> 33:38.486
We just need your official
go order to fire the missiles.

33:43.159 --> 33:45.093
- Go.
- Target is locked.

33:45.127 --> 33:48.897
Missiles are launched.
1 minute, 48 seconds to target.

33:52.735 --> 33:54.736
Nathan, what happened to you?

33:54.770 --> 33:58.206
I was like you once.

33:58.240 --> 34:02.076
True believer.

34:02.111 --> 34:05.980
They say blow up a bridge,
you blow it up.

34:06.015 --> 34:10.752
Forget about the women going to
market that die in the blast.

34:10.786 --> 34:13.688
They say go pick up
some 15-year-old kid,

34:13.722 --> 34:18.359
because he <i>might</i> be a messenger
for a terrorist.

34:18.393 --> 34:20.295
So you bring that kid in,

34:20.329 --> 34:22.964
and you listen to his screams
while they torture him.

34:22.998 --> 34:24.799
You were fighting for
the greater good.

34:24.833 --> 34:26.434
You're a piece
on a chess board,

34:26.467 --> 34:29.637
just like every person
you've ever killed for them.

34:29.672 --> 34:32.273
Except by the time
you figure it out,

34:32.308 --> 34:35.143
you're too screwed up and broken
to be with anyone anymore.

34:35.177 --> 34:37.879
Now you read the statement,

34:37.913 --> 34:40.915
or your family's gonna
watch you die on YouTube.

34:40.949 --> 34:44.452
Why did you kill
12 CIA officers in Chicago?

34:44.485 --> 34:46.254
You people don't understand
anything, do you?

34:46.288 --> 34:48.223
Wait.
[Engines approaching]

34:48.257 --> 34:50.692
I hear it.

34:55.364 --> 34:56.998
Call Langley.
Get them stop it.

34:57.032 --> 34:58.933
My men don't deserve to die.
Do you agree to surrender?

34:58.968 --> 35:01.135
Never. Are you willing
to sacrifice your own life

35:01.170 --> 35:02.270
to end mine?

35:26.528 --> 35:28.496
Leave Mueller.
We got to get outta here now.

35:28.530 --> 35:29.898
Let's move!

35:36.872 --> 35:40.308
Ten seconds to impact.

35:40.342 --> 35:43.978
[Engines approaching]

35:58.794 --> 36:01.729
Target has been neutralized.

36:07.703 --> 36:09.570
Good work, everyone.

36:20.381 --> 36:22.125
I'm sorry that we lost Mueller.

36:22.136 --> 36:23.438
You made it out of there okay.

36:23.439 --> 36:25.206
That's the important thing.

36:25.241 --> 36:26.742
Did you manage to grab anything
from the compound

36:26.743 --> 36:28.010
before the missiles hit?
Yeah, a laptop,

36:28.044 --> 36:31.713
a video camera, and a notebook.

36:31.748 --> 36:33.048
When are you getting back?

36:33.082 --> 36:34.516
We're taking McQuaid's jet
tonight.

36:34.551 --> 36:36.685
But we have to make
a stop first.

36:36.719 --> 36:38.720
I'm glad you're coming home.

36:38.755 --> 36:39.988
Me too.

36:45.295 --> 36:47.296
[Knock at door]

36:47.330 --> 36:49.631
Hey.
Got a minute?

36:49.666 --> 36:51.366
Hey.
Of course.

36:51.401 --> 36:52.834
You know, I never got
a chance to thank you

36:52.869 --> 36:55.504
for all your hard work
over the past 24 hours.

36:55.538 --> 36:57.506
We all deserve some rest.

36:57.540 --> 37:00.142
But you should be very proud.
Thank you.

37:00.176 --> 37:04.813
Look, I-I got to be honest
with you about something.

37:04.847 --> 37:08.917
I could have used a little more
help from you out there.

37:12.055 --> 37:14.690
I trusted your capabilities,
Joan.

37:14.724 --> 37:19.494
And I had some time-sensitive
business to attend to.

37:19.529 --> 37:23.365
I realize you've been trying
to compartmentalize your life,

37:23.399 --> 37:26.668
but it's affecting your ability
to do your job.

37:26.703 --> 37:30.138
And around here, that kind of
thing doesn't go unnoticed.

37:37.981 --> 37:41.283
Hey.
I saw you walking up.

37:41.317 --> 37:44.186
Long night at the office, huh?
You have no idea.

37:44.220 --> 37:47.489
But it is over, and I am all
yours for the rest of the day.

37:47.523 --> 37:48.957
Come on--
I'm leaving, Auggie.

37:51.628 --> 37:53.495
You're leaving?

37:53.529 --> 37:55.497
Why?
You know why.

37:55.531 --> 37:57.411
Because of Hayley?
'Cause that's not real, Tash.

37:57.433 --> 38:00.002
Yeah, well, it looked
pretty real to me.

38:00.036 --> 38:02.437
I hacked into the traffic
cameras outside the restaurant

38:02.472 --> 38:04.806
where you had your date
the other day.

38:04.841 --> 38:07.843
She's pretty, in a type-
bureaucrat kind of way.

38:07.877 --> 38:10.946
- Why did you do that?
- I had to see for myself.

38:10.980 --> 38:13.348
I wanted to be with you, Auggie,
but not like this.

38:13.383 --> 38:15.817
This--this is temporary.

38:15.852 --> 38:17.719
It's stressful,
'cause you're stuck inside.

38:17.754 --> 38:21.156
But we will figure out a way
to make this work.

38:21.190 --> 38:24.226
Fine, then come with me
right now,

38:24.260 --> 38:26.695
and let's make this work
someplace else.

38:26.729 --> 38:29.731
You don't even have to jump off
a train this time.

38:29.766 --> 38:32.834
You just have to walk away.
Tash, I can't just walk away,

38:32.869 --> 38:35.671
not now.
Not now, not then, not ever.

38:35.705 --> 38:37.906
There's always something
more important than me.

38:37.940 --> 38:39.174
- No.
- Good-bye, Auggie.

38:39.208 --> 38:41.910
No, wait, please.
Hey, come on.

38:41.944 --> 38:44.446
Look, it's not that simple.
It's not.

38:47.750 --> 38:50.752
- I'm sorry, but I have to go.
- Tash.

39:21.784 --> 39:25.320
Thank you again.
You're always welcome here.

39:48.478 --> 39:50.512
You want something to drink?

39:50.546 --> 39:52.647
No, thanks.

39:56.919 --> 39:58.987
Listen, all that stuff
that Mueller said up there?

39:59.021 --> 40:00.756
That was bullshit.
I know.

40:00.790 --> 40:03.391
No, I want you to hear this.

40:03.426 --> 40:06.228
Mueller said he was broken.

40:06.262 --> 40:08.163
Now, what separates you
from Mueller

40:08.197 --> 40:09.598
is that when you're broken,

40:09.632 --> 40:13.502
you still have the strength
to do the right thing...

40:13.536 --> 40:15.604
Even when it's hard,
even when it hurts,

40:15.638 --> 40:18.473
even when it comes
at a personal cost.

40:22.011 --> 40:25.981
No one can tell you
how to feel, but...

40:26.015 --> 40:28.850
I can tell you,
you don't have to be alone.

40:37.260 --> 40:39.628
Maybe I'll have that drink.

40:54.877 --> 40:57.813

40:59.482 --> 41:02.484
[Ringing continues]

41:07.023 --> 41:08.456
Roger.

41:08.491 --> 41:10.358
Auggie, there's something
you need to know.

41:10.393 --> 41:11.993
What is it?

41:12.028 --> 41:14.996
We need to talk about
Nathan Mueller.

41:15.031 --> 41:17.132
What do you know
about Mueller?

41:17.166 --> 41:18.400
Look, I still have
some sources

41:18.434 --> 41:19.935
I need to follow up with,

41:19.969 --> 41:22.771
so I'll call you again when
I piece it all together, but...

41:22.805 --> 41:25.207
There's a lot
you don't know, Auggie.

41:25.241 --> 41:27.142
It's not over yet.

41:27.176 --> 41:28.643
