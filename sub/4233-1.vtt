04:35.541 --> 04:36.875
Hey!

04:36.877 --> 04:38.210
Hey... man.

04:38.212 --> 04:40.078
Hey. How you doing, George?

04:40.080 --> 04:42.614
Great to see you.
Did you have a good ride?

04:44.717 --> 04:46.718
Did you get in touch
with Cowboy?

04:46.720 --> 04:49.888
No, not yet, I'm gonna swing by later.
You found some good spots?

04:49.890 --> 04:51.890
Yeah, man.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.941
Take requests and we take bills.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.344
We prefer one over the other.
You guess which.

06:42.202 --> 06:43.969
Thank you, miss.

06:54.213 --> 06:55.514
You guys are really good.

06:55.516 --> 06:56.748
Thank you.

06:58.184 --> 07:00.018
You play any of your own stuff?

07:00.020 --> 07:02.053
Just the classics.

07:02.055 --> 07:05.924
You know, give the people
what they want.

07:05.926 --> 07:10.262
Why, though? You ain't got
nothing to say?

07:11.864 --> 07:13.999
No, ma'am, not really.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.603
Dance all night? Let's do it.

07:48.067 --> 07:50.602
I'm thinking it needs a "D". You
got any kind of student discount?

07:50.604 --> 07:51.970
You a student?

07:51.972 --> 07:55.574
Hey, Ryan, uh, you got
your student ID?

07:55.576 --> 07:56.741
No.

07:56.743 --> 07:59.411
And I left mine in the car... im

07:59.413 --> 08:01.913
but come on, could I be a month
shy of my junior year?

08:01.915 --> 08:03.248
I'm gonna give you
ten percent...

08:03.250 --> 08:05.417
but I don't want you back
here...

08:05.419 --> 08:07.752
asking for picks or rosin
or any of that.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.421
You're a saint, ma'am.

08:09.423 --> 08:14.259
No problem. That'll be $7.95.

08:14.261 --> 08:18.930
Got mahogany sides and neck...

08:18.932 --> 08:22.334
rosewood fret board,
vintage open-back tuning.

08:22.336 --> 08:26.104
And she's got that spruce top,
which is really nice, too.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.506
Yeah.

08:30.276 --> 08:31.610
Hey, you mind if I...

08:31.612 --> 08:33.678
No, go ahead.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.212
Thanks.

09:11.551 --> 09:15.748
We just got her. We haven't
put the tag on yet.

09:15.774 --> 09:17.322
You want a price?

09:17.324 --> 09:19.624
That's okay.

09:35.341 --> 09:37.008
Hello?

09:37.010 --> 09:41.079
Just a sec. Mama, will you turn
that TV down?

09:45.217 --> 09:47.519
Oh, my goodness. Come here.

09:47.521 --> 09:48.853
Hi.

09:48.855 --> 09:52.524
Oh, god, it is good
to see this face.

09:52.526 --> 09:53.592
Hey, how are you guys?

09:53.594 --> 09:55.026
Good. Where's Cowboy?

09:55.028 --> 09:58.063
Oh, my god,
he looks exactly like him.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.031
I know, a spittin' image, huh?
Hi.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.093
Henry and I are just about
to go to the store.

10:02.119 --> 10:03.101
You want to come with?

10:03.103 --> 10:04.769
Is Cowboy gonna be back
later, or...

10:04.771 --> 10:08.373
We'll take the truck. Can you
believe we got a truck?

10:08.375 --> 10:11.076
It was all of our savings
in one go.

10:11.078 --> 10:14.212
Okay, Mom, I'm going to the
store now!

10:14.214 --> 10:16.715
Here you go. Thank you.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.550
So, where you been?
What have you seen?

10:18.552 --> 10:20.885
I heard the Highline
got flooded out this summer.

10:20.887 --> 10:23.722
You didn't get caught
in that mess, did you?

10:23.724 --> 10:26.291
Ginny...

10:26.293 --> 10:28.093
Yeah.

10:28.095 --> 10:30.328
Where's Cowboy?

10:32.898 --> 10:36.901
Last time we spoke, he caught out from New
Orleans and was headed up to Missouri.

10:36.903 --> 10:40.639
I mean, hell, I'd be travelling right there
with him, just like we used to, if I could.

10:40.641 --> 10:43.074
It's not safe for this little
man, huh?

10:43.076 --> 10:47.245
I think it all might just be
different for a momma, you know?

10:47.247 --> 10:52.584
I mean, this little guy, whatever
it takes, it's where I gotta be.

10:52.586 --> 10:58.089
It's easy. It wasn't easy
for Cowboy.

10:58.091 --> 11:02.961
I don't know, he just... he just
got angry. You know?

11:02.963 --> 11:05.597
Like everything made him angry.

11:05.599 --> 11:10.602
He'd go to work, they'd have him work
a double on the fly. He'd get angry.

11:10.604 --> 11:15.173
The hospital kept saying we didn't pay some
anesthesiologist bill we know damn well we paid.

11:15.175 --> 11:20.945
Or the mechanic,
charged $120 too much.

11:20.947 --> 11:25.450
No time to be with Henry.
No time to play music.

11:25.452 --> 11:30.288
No, it's like pretty soon
he was just this man...

11:30.290 --> 11:34.993
looking up at all these tall
things, bigger than him.

11:34.995 --> 11:39.864
And he kept talking about getting
back on the trains, travelling some.

11:39.866 --> 11:45.203
I basically told him to go.
I mean, just for a week.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.972
And how long has he been gone?

11:47.974 --> 11:51.309
A month.

11:51.311 --> 11:56.548
He hasn't called in a couple
of days, but he will.

11:56.550 --> 11:59.517
He'll be happy to know
you're doing so good.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.219
Thanks.

12:03.489 --> 12:07.992
Hey, Cowboy, it's Ryan here. Just
saw Virginia and your critter.

12:07.994 --> 12:12.497
Kid looks just like you... eyes
half asleep and seeing everything.

12:12.499 --> 12:15.400
I came to see you, but
you've been gone, I guess.

12:15.402 --> 12:18.737
Anyway, we're... we're here
in Ogden.

12:18.739 --> 12:25.343
I had a few ideas about
a music thing... a song thing.

12:25.345 --> 12:29.247
Kind of wanted to maybe
run past you...

12:33.185 --> 12:38.423
Anyway, just... just give me
a call, you know, when you can.

12:40.526 --> 12:44.763
I'll talk to you soon, bro.
Take care of yourself. Bye.

12:54.406 --> 12:56.708
Hey.

12:56.710 --> 12:58.443
Hey!

13:01.781 --> 13:03.448
I didn't even see you, lady.
I didn't even see you.

13:03.450 --> 13:04.783
What hurts? Can you tell?

13:04.785 --> 13:06.551
I'm all right, I'm... I'm fine.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.219
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.954
Oh, it's my leg.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.525
Okay, I'm gonna lift this up.
Can I look?

13:16.729 --> 13:17.729
Can you get her
to a hospital, man?

13:17.731 --> 13:20.465
I just lost my insurance. Ust...

13:20.467 --> 13:24.235
I can't do that. I just... if someone
could help me get to my car.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.603
You can't drive with that ankle.

13:25.605 --> 13:28.473
Do you have someone at home?

13:28.475 --> 13:29.941
My mom.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.242
Help me get her in, will you?

13:31.244 --> 13:33.978
Reach up, hold on to my neck.

13:40.586 --> 13:41.920
Thank you.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.088
You'll come, right?
To help get her out?

13:44.090 --> 13:45.824
Yeah, yeah, sure.

13:47.459 --> 13:49.661
Let me just go get my pack.

13:53.599 --> 13:55.033
Shit!

14:04.109 --> 14:05.243
Shit!

14:30.135 --> 14:32.837
What was in your pack?

14:32.839 --> 14:37.542
Had some letters I wanted to
hang on to, but I got my guitar.

14:37.544 --> 14:41.045
Phone with numbers in it.
I'll be all right.

14:44.350 --> 14:48.052
Just put up that one there...
thank you.

15:03.836 --> 15:05.904
It's just there.

15:09.241 --> 15:10.308
You play?

15:12.177 --> 15:13.544
Used to.

15:13.546 --> 15:16.547
You any good?

15:16.549 --> 15:21.853
Hmm, it used to be my living. I had a big,
old corporate record deal and everything.

15:21.855 --> 15:24.589
Don't, however, know if that
makes me any good or not.

15:36.101 --> 15:41.940
Well, uh, I better go find a mat,
supposed to head out tomorrow, so...

15:41.942 --> 15:44.375
My mom'll be home in a minute.
She can give you a lift.

15:44.377 --> 15:48.413
Oh, that's all right, that's all right.
I'll just... I'll just grab a ride.

15:48.415 --> 15:51.783
Nice to meet you, Jackie.
You take care of yourself.

15:55.888 --> 15:59.590
Hey... you want to
at least stay for supper?

15:59.592 --> 16:03.127
Let me make you supper.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.763
You don't have to do that.

16:05.765 --> 16:08.967
And you lost them all... our name

16:08.969 --> 16:13.805
because I couldn't wait to read a text
until after I'd crossed the street.

16:13.807 --> 16:18.977
I might actually have to do
that. Roast chicken?

16:25.617 --> 16:28.152
No, Georgie,
I'm good, I'm fine.

16:28.154 --> 16:31.956
I'm gonna stay here for supper
with this lady.

16:31.958 --> 16:35.226
I don't know, some kind
of thank you or something.

16:38.097 --> 16:41.332
You go on to Virginia's
and when Cowboy calls...

16:41.334 --> 16:43.101
you tell him we're
headin' up to Portland...

16:43.103 --> 16:46.571
and, you know, but we want to
play with him a bit first.

16:48.607 --> 16:52.343
Yeah, I'll see you later.
Yes, like tonight later.

16:53.779 --> 16:57.348
Yeah... okay.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.084
Yeah... bye.

17:49.001 --> 17:51.069
So, where's his house?

17:51.071 --> 17:53.037
I think he just travels, honey.

17:53.039 --> 17:54.072
Look, he's cute.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.674
He is? Mom.

17:56.676 --> 18:01.579
Look, I'll give you he's cute. But he is literally
a homeless person, Jacks... a wanderer.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.047
That's right.

18:03.049 --> 18:05.083
Who the hell lives
like that anymore?

18:05.085 --> 18:07.518
Apparently, the guy taking a
shower in your bathroom upstairs.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.054
It's not the sixties.

18:10.056 --> 18:12.690
So, is that bad?
To wander around?

18:12.692 --> 18:14.725
What do you think?

18:14.727 --> 18:16.928
I don't know yet.

18:16.930 --> 18:19.597
Good answer, honey.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.200
Carrots? Yeah.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.434
Here's some right there.

18:23.436 --> 18:26.737
That's enough, yeah.

18:26.739 --> 18:30.041
So have you ever worked?

18:30.043 --> 18:32.710
Yes, ma'am, since I was 14.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.379
Construction...
salmon fishing up in Alaska.

18:35.381 --> 18:37.281
Ran a farm for a couple years.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.583
What kind of farm?

18:38.585 --> 18:40.284
It was organic... co-op.

18:40.286 --> 18:43.054
We had a program where we took
in at-risk youth from Nashville.

18:43.056 --> 18:46.090
We gave them a piece of land, taught 'em
how to understand planting cycles...

18:46.092 --> 18:48.226
the moon, seasons,
things like that.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.061
Did it help?

18:50.063 --> 18:52.463
Shoulda seen the...
look in their eyes.

18:52.465 --> 18:56.234
The end of summer, they'd come back and look
at their plot, see the little buds coming up.

18:56.236 --> 19:02.473
You could tell they felt...
just... uh...

19:02.475 --> 19:05.309
Proprietary.

19:05.311 --> 19:09.947
Yeah... yeah, proprietary
is a good word for it.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.216
When are you planning
on leaving?

19:14.920 --> 19:17.488
I'm asking how long a person stays
when they're not so used to staying.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.756
Leaving after dinner.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.124
Really?

19:20.126 --> 19:21.926
Yeah, I gotta go meet up
with my friend Georgie.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.928
We're heading to Portland
tomorrow morning.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.097
There's a folk festival happening,
it's a good time to busk.

19:26.099 --> 19:29.167
So, where do you keep your
shampoo and stuff?

19:29.169 --> 19:31.936
Well, it was in my pack.

19:31.938 --> 19:33.604
You want some of these?

19:33.606 --> 19:36.140
But they didn't get
your banjo, huh?

19:36.142 --> 19:37.141
Or the guitar.

19:37.143 --> 19:38.276
Oh.

19:38.278 --> 19:40.444
That's right.

19:40.446 --> 19:43.514
So, you just carry everything
around with you? Like a turtle?

19:43.516 --> 19:46.617
You ever seen a turtle with
a backpack? Imagine that.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.452
I already have this
stupid house on my back...

19:48.454 --> 19:50.788
and now I have to carry 'round
my shampoo in this thing?

19:50.790 --> 19:52.957
I don't even need shampoo, I'm a
turtle. I don't have any hair.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.625
You think they have
TVs in there?

19:54.627 --> 19:58.362
Oh, yeah, absolutely. Why else
do you think they move so slow?

20:02.634 --> 20:04.135
It's good, Grandma.

20:04.137 --> 20:09.807
It's delicious, thank you.

20:09.809 --> 20:13.306
No, we're not gonna come back
to New York for Christmas.

20:13.332 --> 20:15.146
We're staying at my mother's.

20:15.148 --> 20:16.981
So, the first time
in nine years...

20:16.983 --> 20:19.483
you were going to tear yourself
away from the office...

20:19.485 --> 20:22.320
and spend some quality time with
your kid during the holidays?

20:22.322 --> 20:24.989
You want some chips, too?
Got some chips left.

20:24.991 --> 20:28.259
No, really, I'm... I'm good.
Really.

20:30.495 --> 20:33.497
No, I don't want you
to fly out...

20:33.499 --> 20:36.000
Because, I don't want your...

20:36.002 --> 20:38.836
Stop, Wes, stop it,
just stop it, please.

20:38.838 --> 20:41.572
This is exactly
why we left last week.

20:41.574 --> 20:45.209
Okay, water, pop, soda,
what do you like?

20:45.211 --> 20:47.011
Oh, I got a leftover Mr. Pibb,
you want that?

20:47.013 --> 20:49.180
No, honestly, this is fine.

20:49.182 --> 20:53.918
I'll tell her you said goodbye.

20:53.920 --> 20:58.589
And listen, I got this bag, would you mind
taking out the trash on your way past the cans?

20:58.591 --> 21:00.758
Of course.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.860
Nice to meet you, Robert.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.395
It's Ryan.

21:04.397 --> 21:07.865
Well, good luck in all
that you do, okay? There you go.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.267
Thank you, ma'am.

21:11.036 --> 21:13.671
Mom? Mom?

21:15.607 --> 21:16.540
Uh, Jackie...

21:16.542 --> 21:18.376
Mom. Lia...

21:18.378 --> 21:20.611
I gotta go, Wes, Lia is up.
I gotta go. I gotta go, Jesus!

21:20.613 --> 21:23.381
Hey, sweetheart.
Where'd you go?

21:23.383 --> 21:26.550
Momma's right here, sweetheart. Come on,
sleepy head, let's go back to bed, come on.

21:26.552 --> 21:29.887
Hey, don't leave.
I, uh, found some stuff.

21:29.889 --> 21:32.223
Is my mom having you
take the trash out?

21:32.225 --> 21:34.558
Little bit.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.794
Oh, Jesus Christ, come on,
sweetheart.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.030
You get her back down?

22:46.032 --> 22:48.966
She's not used to it here yet.

22:48.968 --> 22:52.982
The quiet, you know, it's
its own kind of sound.

22:53.008 --> 22:54.538
Not like New York.

22:54.540 --> 22:55.940
So...

22:59.211 --> 23:01.846
Useful? Not useful?

23:01.848 --> 23:06.817
Well, you don't... you really
don't have to do any of this.

23:06.819 --> 23:11.355
It's supposed to have matches
in it. No matches. I dunno.

23:11.357 --> 23:14.658
And, as it turns out,
the flint doesn't work.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.894
Compass works.

23:16.896 --> 23:21.832
So you'll be able to tell precisely where
you are when the big emergency occurs.

23:21.834 --> 23:24.502
Plus, I'll have this extra,
long piece of string.

23:24.504 --> 23:30.174
Yeah, you can spell out 'SOS'
in tiny, little neon letters.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.209
I'm sure it'll come
in handy. Thank you.

23:32.211 --> 23:38.649
Cool. There's a flashlight in here, too.
And I found these, and these.

23:39.851 --> 23:42.153
Thanks.

23:44.890 --> 23:46.557
So where after Portland?

23:46.559 --> 23:50.594
I'll probably take the low-line
down West through Texas.

23:50.596 --> 23:56.200
I got a friend down there got an old
time band, makes his own banjos.

23:56.202 --> 23:57.401
Yeah?

23:57.403 --> 23:59.537
Deer skin, just like
the old time kind.

23:59.539 --> 24:00.538
Different sound?

24:00.540 --> 24:04.708
Yeah, deeper, kinda. Beautiful.

24:04.710 --> 24:09.547
Too small. Thanks, though.
You're sweet.

24:09.549 --> 24:13.284
When did you start traveling?
After high school?

24:13.286 --> 24:16.220
I didn't really get
through high school.

24:16.222 --> 24:19.590
I didn't get much
past 7th grade.

24:19.592 --> 24:21.392
Home schooled?

24:21.394 --> 24:23.294
Not really.

24:23.296 --> 24:29.433
My mom, she had us kids and my
stepdad... job.

24:29.435 --> 24:32.169
Worked her fingers to the bone.

24:35.073 --> 24:37.241
When was the last time
you were back?

24:37.243 --> 24:39.243
Stepdad's funeral.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.479
I'm sorry.

24:41.481 --> 24:42.980
Don't be.

24:45.650 --> 24:48.285
Yeah.

24:48.287 --> 24:51.155
I had one of those
kind of stepdads, too.

24:59.130 --> 25:00.831
Can I take a drag of that?

25:11.343 --> 25:13.677
Can I hear you play?

25:13.679 --> 25:18.349
Sure. What do...
what do you want to hear?

25:18.351 --> 25:20.951
Um, that song.

25:36.635 --> 25:38.802
No one's heard it?

25:38.804 --> 25:41.238
It's nothing to hear, really.

25:43.642 --> 25:46.377
It's like this, right?

27:14.799 --> 27:16.567
Keep going.

27:16.569 --> 27:19.169
That's all I got.

27:23.408 --> 27:25.643
Now that ain't true.

27:45.296 --> 27:48.610
There's a fold-out cot in
the back in the studio.

27:48.636 --> 27:50.359
Some blankets next to it.

28:10.488 --> 28:12.690
I know, Georgie.

28:12.692 --> 28:15.492
'Cause it was snowing and
I'm not gonna catch a ride...

28:15.494 --> 28:18.295
in the middle of a corn field
in a damn snowstorm.

28:18.297 --> 28:21.131
Yeah, I'm leaving to head
into town right now.

28:21.133 --> 28:24.835
Hey, did Cowboy call yet?

28:24.837 --> 28:28.138
There's no girl, Georgie.

28:28.140 --> 28:32.242
No, no one is falling for
anything and there is no girl.

28:38.216 --> 28:41.552
Yeah, I'm headed there
this afternoon.

28:41.554 --> 28:45.923
Yeah, I'll call you when
I'm on my way. Okay, bye.

29:55.260 --> 29:57.761
Lia, Lia, hold on, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

29:57.763 --> 29:59.563
No! No, Mom! No!

29:59.565 --> 30:01.265
Wait... stop.

30:01.267 --> 30:05.068
It's not even sunny, Mom.
Look, Mom, it's not even...

30:05.070 --> 30:07.137
Hey!

30:07.139 --> 30:09.306
Hi, what you doing?

30:09.308 --> 30:10.808
You got leaks.

30:10.810 --> 30:12.743
You a roofer?

30:12.745 --> 30:15.245
Sometimes... hey, your Mom
doesn't get this fixed...

30:15.247 --> 30:18.148
This whole left side of this porch is
gonna come down first really heavy snow.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.484
Yeah, that's what
the other guy told her.

30:20.486 --> 30:23.153
So she knows
there's a problem, huh?

30:23.155 --> 30:26.123
We can't afford
to fix it right now.

30:26.125 --> 30:31.094
Jeopardizes the foundation
you let it rot out like this.

30:31.096 --> 30:33.597
Probably get you patched up.
Take an afternoon.

30:33.599 --> 30:36.800
Couple hundred for supplies.
You guys do that?

30:36.802 --> 30:39.503
Mom! Yeah. Yeah, I'm
coming, I'm coming.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.939
I'm gonna be late, let's go.
I'm coming.

30:41.941 --> 30:43.640
What about you?

30:43.642 --> 30:45.342
What about me?

30:45.344 --> 30:47.778
The labor... we can't...

30:47.780 --> 30:53.350
Don't worry about it. Besides, you seen this
fancy, new compass this nice lady gave me?

30:58.022 --> 31:00.791
Mom, come on,
I gotta get to camp!

31:00.793 --> 31:02.073
Okay, I'm coming.

31:32.390 --> 31:35.225
Who do you think you are, Ryan?

31:46.704 --> 31:50.507
I'm sorry. Look at you.
You did not grow up around here.

31:50.509 --> 31:52.709
State Road 26.
Murdock Elementary.

31:52.711 --> 31:53.710
When'd you graduate?

31:53.712 --> 31:55.846
Oh, a lady never tells.

31:55.848 --> 31:58.849
I like that answer.
I'm gonna use that answer.

31:58.851 --> 32:03.587
So, um, when do you think Mr. Kooper
will actually be holding the interviews?

32:03.589 --> 32:07.557
Well, of course,
there technically is no job.

32:07.559 --> 32:11.194
Well, you put that ad up online, 'Music
teacher', Experience preferred'.

32:11.196 --> 32:13.563
I'll be honest with you, Jackie.

32:13.565 --> 32:17.701
Mr. Kooper was kinda hoping we could
get into an intern-type situation...

32:17.703 --> 32:20.404
someone who just got their
degree from University State...

32:20.406 --> 32:23.040
and is looking to pick up hours
toward their certification.

32:23.042 --> 32:24.541
Okay.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.877
Of course, we do have some
subbing coming up.

32:26.879 --> 32:28.445
That'd be great.

32:28.447 --> 32:31.882
We got a lady choir teacher,
third pregnancy in four years.

32:31.884 --> 32:35.886
I am like, "Honey, shut the damn
bedroom door," you know?

32:35.888 --> 32:38.288
Right, well, I'm gonna leave my
resume with you, Darlene...

32:38.290 --> 32:41.591
because I'd be thrilled to subbing or
if you get the money for a position...

32:41.593 --> 32:44.895
You know, I just have
to ask you one more question.

32:44.897 --> 32:49.066
When you had the album out,
which I loved, by the way...

32:49.068 --> 32:52.269
I used to listen to it all the time when
I'd take my Sunday afternoon lady baths.

32:52.271 --> 32:54.137
Okay, thank you.

32:54.139 --> 32:58.642
So, on tour and stuff, did you
used to ride around in limos?

32:58.644 --> 33:01.111
Every now and then, sure.

33:01.113 --> 33:04.448
Is it true that they have free
candy cups in the back?

33:04.450 --> 33:07.451
Someone told me about free candy
cups, M&Ms and Reese's...

33:07.453 --> 33:09.753
and stuff, and you can eat
what you want for free.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.154
It depended on the limo.

33:11.156 --> 33:13.924
Oh, wow, you must have
been so proud.

33:13.926 --> 33:16.593
It was just pop song stuff.

33:16.595 --> 33:17.828
Well, that's not nothin'.

33:17.830 --> 33:19.196
Actually, it is, Darlene.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.868
Okay.

33:27.505 --> 33:29.039
How'd it go?

33:30.842 --> 33:32.442
You drive.

33:32.444 --> 33:35.946
I should be in charge
of nothing.

33:35.948 --> 33:37.814
What happened?

33:37.816 --> 33:40.183
So, there's something
wrong with her card.

33:42.120 --> 33:46.023
Uh, why don't you go ahead
and try it again.

33:47.792 --> 33:50.160
And his attorney will be
on the call, too.

33:50.162 --> 33:52.112
Yeah, well, we can discuss
that in mediation, right?

33:52.138 --> 33:53.363
Isn't that what
mediation is for?

33:53.365 --> 33:55.032
Hey, Jackie?

33:55.034 --> 33:56.967
Says declined, I don't
know what that means.

33:56.969 --> 34:02.639
It means my soon-to-be-ex-husband
is an asshole.

34:02.641 --> 34:08.078
Thank you. All right,
20 minutes? I can do that, yeah.

34:14.018 --> 34:15.886
Listen, uh, I've got this, uh...

34:15.888 --> 34:19.389
Conference call,
is it here in town?

34:21.659 --> 34:22.859
Yeah.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.928
You want me to drive?

34:27.498 --> 34:30.567
'Cause I said I'd fix the roof
and I'd like to do it.

34:30.569 --> 34:33.837
What guy in Portland, Georgie?

34:33.839 --> 34:37.440
Oh, oh, he works at a recording
studio, as what?

34:40.545 --> 34:43.213
He... he said that?

34:43.215 --> 34:45.415
For free, why?

34:48.518 --> 34:54.056
Well... well, he'll wait...
because he will.

34:54.059 --> 34:57.360
Because I got a feeling
that he will.

34:57.362 --> 35:00.230
Well, yeah, you head on
and I'll head out tomorrow...

35:00.232 --> 35:01.898
and just tell him
I'm coming, okay?

35:01.900 --> 35:04.067
And just call me
when you get there.

35:04.069 --> 35:08.772
Oh, did... did Virginia get
a call from Cowboy yet?

35:08.774 --> 35:15.112
Yeah... yeah... okay.
All right, bye, bye.

36:30.621 --> 36:32.989
Yeah, and thanks again
for the last minute.

36:32.991 --> 36:34.691
We just wanted to make sure
we caught you all...

36:34.693 --> 36:36.793
before end of business there
in New York.

36:36.795 --> 36:38.628
<i>So everyone is clear...</i>

36:38.630 --> 36:41.031
<i>so Wes is clear, are you</i>
<i>representing Jackie, Matt?</i>

36:41.033 --> 36:43.300
I'm just an old friend here asking
a few questions on her behalf.

36:43.302 --> 36:45.969
- Gratis.
- Of course.

36:45.971 --> 36:48.471
<i>So Jackie still has
no legal representation at this time?</i>

36:48.473 --> 36:50.540
<i>Jesus Christ, Jackie...</i>

36:50.542 --> 36:52.976
<i>it's like you can't help but</i>
<i>put yourself at a disadvantage.</i>

36:52.978 --> 36:55.645
<i>Is it like a goddamn</i>
<i>compulsion? Huh?</i>

36:55.647 --> 36:58.181
<i>Matt, listen, with
all due respect to what I'm sure...</i>

36:58.183 --> 37:00.650
<i>is a tremendously successful business
you have going on there in Ogden...</i>

37:00.652 --> 37:03.053
<i>and regardless of how much we
appreciate you giving Jackie counsel...</i>

37:03.055 --> 37:06.156
<i>I think what Wes and myself want
to make clear is at this point...</i>

37:06.158 --> 37:09.893
<i>Jackie should very seriously consider
getting herself some actual representation.</i>

37:09.895 --> 37:12.329
We understand, we're gonna need
a list of assets, Bill.

37:12.331 --> 37:15.665
Things that Jackie brought
to the marriage, jewelry, art...

37:15.667 --> 37:20.003
the condo in Manhattan obviously
is the biggest item.

37:20.005 --> 37:22.172
<i>You're aware, I'm assuming...</i>

37:22.174 --> 37:24.407
<i>that Miss Laurel took several</i>
<i>loans on her Manhattan condo.</i>

37:24.409 --> 37:27.544
Yes, of course, and it will be
assessed at its current value.

37:27.546 --> 37:31.881
Listen, we just need to assure you
that Jackie will be fully prepped...

37:31.883 --> 37:35.018
and in good shape
for the mediation.

37:35.020 --> 37:37.254
<i>We're not mediating.</i>

37:41.559 --> 37:45.195
Maybe I misunderstood. Jackie was under
the impression that you had already...

37:45.197 --> 37:46.896
<i>I changed my mind,
I'm not doing it.</i>

37:46.898 --> 37:50.767
<i>Not with my daughter's</i>
<i>well-being at stake.</i>

37:50.769 --> 37:54.237
What the hell did you just say?
Did I just... Jackie.

37:54.239 --> 37:57.374
Hear you saying somehow that I don't
have Lia's best interest in mind?

37:57.376 --> 37:59.242
Jackie...

37:59.244 --> 38:00.877
<i>Where are you, huh?
Utah? Really?</i>

38:00.879 --> 38:03.713
Her well-being is the only thing
I think about.

38:03.715 --> 38:06.416
It is the only thing I think
about! Fuck you!

38:06.418 --> 38:09.252
<i>Will you
calm her down, please, Matt?</i>

38:09.254 --> 38:10.654
Jackie?

38:12.790 --> 38:14.224
<i>Matt?</i>

38:14.226 --> 38:16.626
Yes, we are fine.
Everything is good.

38:16.628 --> 38:19.562
<i>Let me put it
to you this way, Matt. All right?</i>

38:19.564 --> 38:23.066
<i>The fact that I am the attorney you're talking
to on this phone call, you're talking to me...</i>

38:23.068 --> 38:26.403
<i>as Wes' representation that needs to let
you know that Jackie's situation...</i>

38:26.405 --> 38:30.140
<i>is well past the point where
mediation is even a possibility.</i>

38:32.576 --> 38:35.412
Oh, god.

38:35.414 --> 38:42.752
<i>Take me off speaker.
Jackie? Okay?</i>

38:42.754 --> 38:47.357
<i>I'm sorry I yelled, I'm
sorry I said that about Lia.</i>

38:50.594 --> 38:52.896
<i>Jackie?</i>

39:02.473 --> 39:09.512
Yes. Yes, I want this
to stop, how?

39:20.624 --> 39:24.194
I understand... yes.

39:26.130 --> 39:28.098
What did he say?

39:30.668 --> 39:33.103
Jackie.

39:49.186 --> 39:51.721
You guys are in my band now.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.990
I gotta know the names of my
band, so what's your name?

39:53.992 --> 39:55.225
Alan.

39:55.227 --> 39:57.026
What's your name? Millie.

39:57.028 --> 40:00.563
What's your name?
What's your name?

40:00.565 --> 40:02.232
Dylan.

40:06.036 --> 40:07.670
Are you gonna sing with me?

40:07.672 --> 40:09.839
Yeah.

40:20.218 --> 40:22.085
Now you guys.

40:27.192 --> 40:28.591
Yeah, yeah.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.073
Comes in now.

40:47.212 --> 40:48.912
Boys.

41:15.973 --> 41:19.309
So, you just run alongside
and jump on?

41:19.311 --> 41:21.644
Better if you wait in the yard.

41:21.646 --> 41:23.646
Climb on and settle 'til it go.

41:23.648 --> 41:28.751
Gotta wait for the right one,
though. Sometimes for days.

41:28.753 --> 41:31.421
What makes it the right one?

41:31.423 --> 41:33.857
It's going where you wanna go.

41:37.294 --> 41:39.262
They give you a hard time?

41:39.264 --> 41:45.201
Who, the train cops? Sometimes.
Some of 'em are real nice.

41:48.639 --> 41:51.140
So you just wait.

41:51.142 --> 41:52.509
Just wait.

41:52.511 --> 41:54.944
Then you get on.

41:54.946 --> 41:57.380
Yeah. And you're gone.

42:00.618 --> 42:02.352
Mm-hm.

42:06.023 --> 42:09.025
My husband just told me that if I
don't go back to New York Monday...

42:09.027 --> 42:12.595
and stop divorce proceedings, he's
gonna sue for full custody of Lia.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.535
What would you do?

43:05.082 --> 43:06.649
Better.

43:13.724 --> 43:16.526
Oh, no...

43:23.602 --> 43:25.702
Hey, Mom, listen.

43:33.211 --> 43:35.278
That's really great, honey.
It's great.

43:35.280 --> 43:37.046
Hey, Mom, can we go
to Fiddler's tonight?

43:37.048 --> 43:38.948
Yeah, sure, I don't see why not.

43:38.950 --> 43:40.950
Can we take Ryan, too?

44:11.415 --> 44:14.083
Hey, Mom, can I have five bucks
for an elephant ear?

44:14.085 --> 44:15.985
Five bucks, really? Yeah.

44:15.987 --> 44:17.947
For an elephant ear?
You don't have it?

44:18.922 --> 44:23.660
Jesus Christ, okay, hold on.

44:23.662 --> 44:26.262
All right,
get Mommy one, too, okay?

44:26.264 --> 44:28.297
Okay. Where's the elephant...
where are they?

44:28.299 --> 44:29.632
They're down here, aren't they?

44:29.634 --> 44:31.501
Yeah.

44:31.503 --> 44:33.269
When you gonna stop talking
to her in the third person?

44:33.271 --> 44:34.971
What's third person mean?

44:34.973 --> 44:37.407
Take Grandma with you,
have her explain third person.

44:54.124 --> 44:55.825
They're good, right?

44:55.827 --> 44:57.260
Real good.

44:59.129 --> 45:02.532
Little guys been playing here
like that since I was a kid.

45:02.534 --> 45:05.868
That's the way Ogden is. Has its
little secrets it never tells.

45:31.862 --> 45:34.731
Ryan. Ryan!

45:35.733 --> 45:37.667
Hey!

45:37.669 --> 45:40.369
Come meet Virginia.

45:40.371 --> 45:42.338
Hey. Hey, how you doing?

45:42.340 --> 45:44.507
Good. Who's this?

45:44.509 --> 45:48.344
This is my friend, Jackie. This is
Virginia, this is my friend Cowboy's girl.

45:48.346 --> 45:49.879
Taught me everything
I know about traveling.

45:49.881 --> 45:52.181
And who's this?

45:52.183 --> 45:54.350
This is Henry.

45:54.352 --> 45:57.687
Aw, that one over there,
that's mine.

45:57.689 --> 45:59.188
- That one?
- Yeah.

45:59.190 --> 46:02.024
She's beautiful.

46:02.026 --> 46:06.863
I remember these days.
Changes everything.

46:06.865 --> 46:10.366
Ah, yeah, I'd a done it years earlier
if I'd known how much fun it was.

46:10.368 --> 46:11.534
Right.

46:11.536 --> 46:14.771
Ginny, you hear from him yet?

46:14.773 --> 46:17.373
He worries.

46:17.375 --> 46:19.709
Cowboy took you
under <i> his</i> wing, remember?

46:19.711 --> 46:23.412
Little 16-year-old crustpunk runaway messed
up in all sorts of no-good nonsense.

46:23.414 --> 46:24.881
Mm-hm.

46:24.883 --> 46:28.117
Took care of you.
He can take care of himself.

46:28.119 --> 46:31.254
Betcha he calls tonight.

46:31.256 --> 46:32.922
Yep.

46:32.924 --> 46:34.791
Jackie! Jackie, is that you?

46:34.793 --> 46:36.292
Oh, Doc.

46:36.294 --> 46:38.394
Man, you're a sight.
Come here, girl!

46:38.396 --> 46:39.562
Oh, it's good to see you.

46:39.564 --> 46:40.596
Good to see you.

46:40.598 --> 46:41.464
This is Ryan.

46:41.466 --> 46:43.132
Hey, Ryan. Hey.

46:43.134 --> 46:44.300
How's everything going
this year?

46:44.302 --> 46:45.401
Ah, I'll tell you later.
Come on.

46:45.403 --> 46:46.736
What's going on? Come on.

46:46.738 --> 46:47.804
- What are we doing?
- Now come on.

46:47.806 --> 46:49.272
No, no, no. Oh, Doc, no.

46:49.274 --> 46:52.675
Yeah, yeah. Come on, let's go.

47:08.091 --> 47:11.761
Yeah! They love it.

47:11.763 --> 47:16.766
Folks, hey, folks, how about they do something
with a little gal who was born and bred...

47:16.768 --> 47:18.634
right here in Ogden...

47:18.636 --> 47:23.306
who's very first time on stage
was at this festival...

47:23.308 --> 47:26.075
our own... Jackie Laurel!

47:28.345 --> 47:30.546
Proud to have you back, hon.
Thank you.

47:32.683 --> 47:34.016
How are ya'll doin' tonight?

47:36.620 --> 47:40.022
Good!

47:40.024 --> 47:44.660
I'm gonna sing you something that I've been
thinking about a lot lately, an old-time number.

47:44.662 --> 47:51.500
Because I don't know about you, but I been
seein' a lot of people I know, good people...

47:51.502 --> 47:54.470
smart people, hard-workin'
people...

47:54.472 --> 47:59.008
havin' to make different kinds
of choices these days.

47:59.010 --> 48:01.477
Tough choices...

48:01.479 --> 48:05.915
The kinda choices you make when you don't
feel you have much to choose from.

48:08.485 --> 48:10.319
Lia, come on, come on.

48:10.321 --> 48:13.022
I'm gonna have my daughter sing
this song with me...

48:13.024 --> 48:16.225
because she has the voice of an
angel and she knows this one.

48:17.995 --> 48:18.995
Come on, come on.

48:18.997 --> 48:21.163
What is it, Mom?

48:21.165 --> 48:22.763
You're gonna know it
when they start playing.

48:22.789 --> 48:23.666
Please sing this with me.

48:23.668 --> 48:24.834
Okay.

48:24.836 --> 48:28.804
Okay. Two, three, four...

49:22.727 --> 49:24.794
She always been able to do that?

50:03.600 --> 50:06.268
I love you so much, sweetie.

50:06.270 --> 50:08.504
More than anything
in the entire world.

50:10.107 --> 50:12.842
Jackie Laurel, folks!

50:17.647 --> 50:22.551
And now an old favorite, folks.
Ferghis Daley.

51:00.157 --> 51:01.590
Jackie!

51:06.997 --> 51:09.565
Jackie!

51:11.334 --> 51:15.471
Hey! Hey.

51:18.041 --> 51:21.544
Hey.

51:21.546 --> 51:24.847
What's wrong?

51:24.849 --> 51:26.782
Hey, come here.

51:41.031 --> 51:43.866
He's not gonna take her
from you.

51:43.868 --> 51:46.869
He's got money. He's got family money.
He's got this attorney already, I can't...

51:46.871 --> 51:49.371
Hey.

51:49.373 --> 51:51.440
He's not gonna take her from
you.

51:54.945 --> 51:56.946
How do you know?

51:58.949 --> 52:01.617
Because you're not
gonna let him.

53:11.855 --> 53:15.791
Who told you not to sing?

53:15.793 --> 53:18.627
No... no one... no one
told me not to sing.

53:18.629 --> 53:23.966
A song is havin' something to say. You
got songs and you don't sing 'em. Why?

53:23.968 --> 53:26.402
Someone tell you
they didn't wanna hear?

53:28.705 --> 53:32.107
No.

53:37.881 --> 53:40.316
Who told you not to sing? Hm?

53:40.318 --> 53:41.483
I sang.

53:41.485 --> 53:44.119
Oh, like you did tonight?

53:46.156 --> 53:54.156
No, you're right.
Of course, you're right.

53:54.198 --> 54:00.569
You... you ask yourself,
"How'd I get here?" You know?

54:00.571 --> 54:04.073
And you chose to be here.

54:04.075 --> 54:11.046
Chose this song, not that one, that
city, that condo, that loan, that man.

54:11.048 --> 54:16.418
And here you are.
Here you are, you know?

54:17.887 --> 54:19.588
No.

54:22.726 --> 54:25.594
You don't ever ask yourself
how you got here?

54:26.863 --> 54:28.063
No.

54:28.065 --> 54:32.101
Not ever?

54:32.103 --> 54:38.274
Every day I say, where am I gonna go next?
How am I gonna get there?

54:49.552 --> 54:55.958
There's this guy in Portland,
friend of a friend.

54:55.960 --> 55:03.132
He has a sound studio there. Says
he wants to record Georgie and me.

55:04.801 --> 55:06.902
Good.

55:06.904 --> 55:08.184
It's good, do it.

55:12.275 --> 55:14.310
Yeah?

55:14.312 --> 55:16.312
Yeah.

55:19.416 --> 55:24.953
Sing 'em that song, the one
that's about me, yeah?

55:24.955 --> 55:26.922
Wh... what song?

55:26.924 --> 55:28.657
It's about me, isn't it?

55:28.659 --> 55:29.758
What is?

55:29.760 --> 55:31.894
Your song.

56:21.811 --> 56:23.712
Hey.

56:23.714 --> 56:25.547
Hey.

56:28.685 --> 56:32.388
You gonna take me back down?

56:32.390 --> 56:34.690
You wanna go back down?

56:34.692 --> 56:36.992
No.

56:36.994 --> 56:38.560
Okay.

56:43.166 --> 56:45.401
My dad's an asshole.

56:47.670 --> 56:52.207
Well... I'm sure he loves you.

56:52.209 --> 56:54.450
Doesn't mean
he's not an asshole.

56:59.416 --> 57:01.850
How was your dad?

57:01.852 --> 57:04.186
I had a stepdad.

57:04.188 --> 57:05.921
How was he?

57:08.691 --> 57:11.093
He was an asshole.

57:15.865 --> 57:19.535
How long are you gonna stay?

57:19.537 --> 57:21.737
Well, I gotta get done fixing
this roof first.

57:21.739 --> 57:23.572
Then?

57:23.574 --> 57:27.476
Well, hard to say.

57:29.379 --> 57:31.280
No, it isn't.

57:50.433 --> 57:54.102
Hey, Cowboy, it's Ryan again. Sorry I
keep leavin' you all these messages, man.

57:54.104 --> 58:00.309
I just really want to talk to you about this
music thing I've been trying to work out.

58:00.311 --> 58:04.246
Anyway, just, uh, I don't know, give
me a call when you get a chance.

58:04.248 --> 58:07.382
Talk to you soon.
All right, be safe. Bye.

58:09.619 --> 58:13.889
So, uh, how much?

58:15.124 --> 58:17.826
$1175.

58:17.828 --> 58:19.428
We can give you
a student discount.

58:19.430 --> 58:20.929
Yeah?

58:20.931 --> 58:26.869
Yeah, 10 percent, with tax,
about $1065.

58:29.806 --> 58:32.174
I might be back. Thank you.

58:32.176 --> 58:33.408
Yeah.

58:55.632 --> 58:57.032
You're up?

58:57.034 --> 58:59.201
Yeah.

59:20.156 --> 59:24.693
You got a loop in one of those
velvet board things?

59:24.695 --> 59:27.930
All right, let's see
what we got here.

59:54.691 --> 59:57.392
Hey! Hey! No, you can't
do that here.

59:57.394 --> 59:59.194
Sir, I'm just playing a song.

59:59.196 --> 01:00:02.431
Come on, go now, before
I call the police. Go!

01:00:02.433 --> 01:00:03.599
All right.

01:00:03.601 --> 01:00:07.202
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on.

01:00:07.204 --> 01:00:09.271
Go! Git! Git!

01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:11.540
Why don't you calm down! Huh?

01:00:11.542 --> 01:00:15.944
I'm picking up my guitar and then
I'm walking away, all right?

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:19.448
I will call the police.

01:01:12.435 --> 01:01:15.303
Only a lawyer can afford
a goddamn family day.

01:01:15.305 --> 01:01:17.606
How'd you know
where to find me?

01:01:17.608 --> 01:01:21.143
You said you bought from your Dad.
Senior year we TP'd your house.

01:01:21.145 --> 01:01:22.344
That was you guys?

01:01:22.346 --> 01:01:24.446
Couldn't be helped, dude.

01:01:24.448 --> 01:01:26.615
Do you know how every girl on the
cheer team had a crush on you?

01:01:26.617 --> 01:01:28.984
They wanted to know where
Matt Ridenour lived.

01:01:28.986 --> 01:01:31.456
Yeah, hey, you want some hot
chocolate or something?

01:01:31.482 --> 01:01:32.621
Cheryl just put some on.

01:01:32.623 --> 01:01:34.322
How much you need, Matt?

01:01:34.324 --> 01:01:36.625
Of what?

01:01:36.627 --> 01:01:41.830
To put you on retainer. I've got about
seven or eight thousand, is that enough?

01:01:41.832 --> 01:01:48.804
Listen, uh, Wes's guy is huge. We're
talking major New York divorces.

01:01:48.806 --> 01:01:53.709
I know, he's an old family friend of Wes's.
He went to my damn wedding.

01:01:53.711 --> 01:01:54.976
What's that mean?

01:01:54.978 --> 01:01:57.312
Lotta hours.
Lotta, lotta hours.

01:01:57.314 --> 01:01:59.314
What's that mean, Matt?

01:01:59.316 --> 01:02:03.485
You know, my partners, well, they'll
kill me if I make it any less.

01:02:03.487 --> 01:02:07.222
I mean, the firm's gonna need
a retainer of at least $30,000.

01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:23.505
Okay... okay. I'll call you.
Answer your damn phone this time.

01:02:23.507 --> 01:02:24.707
Jackie, what are you gonna do?

01:02:24.708 --> 01:02:26.007
Answer your damn phone!

01:02:26.009 --> 01:02:27.476
Jackie!

01:02:45.194 --> 01:02:46.862
Lia!

01:02:46.864 --> 01:02:48.263
Hey, Mom, whatcha doin' here?
You gotta second, honey?

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:50.031
Yeah...

01:02:50.033 --> 01:02:51.366
Actually Ms. Laurel, the girls
and I were just about to head...

01:02:51.368 --> 01:02:52.701
over to the nature center
apiary.

01:02:52.703 --> 01:02:55.203
How about we do one more round,
huh? On me.

01:02:55.205 --> 01:02:56.905
Awesome! Cool.

01:02:56.907 --> 01:03:00.942
So we'd never go back
to New York?

01:03:00.944 --> 01:03:03.712
I'm not movin' forward with this
unless you're okay with it.

01:03:03.714 --> 01:03:07.282
You know that. We're a team,
you and me.

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:13.121
Did you like growing up here?

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:17.125
Hated it. Couldn't wait
to get the hell out.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:19.127
That's great. Just great.

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:22.631
Until I left. Then I liked it.

01:03:22.633 --> 01:03:27.803
I liked bein' from here.
It's a good place to be from.

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:39.981
What do you say?
You wanna be from here, too?

01:04:26.295 --> 01:04:27.863
Thanks.

01:04:29.498 --> 01:04:31.032
Thank you.

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:41.543
Hello? Hi, Virginia? Hey,
hey, hey, did Cowboy call?

01:04:51.687 --> 01:04:54.990
I have here a poem that Scott...
'Cowboy'.

01:04:54.992 --> 01:04:58.827
Everybody called him that...
'Cowboy'...

01:04:58.829 --> 01:05:02.831
that Cowboy read at his
high school graduation.

01:05:02.833 --> 01:05:08.470
It seemed like a real, nice
poem. It's by E.E. Cummings.

01:05:12.508 --> 01:05:19.281
"For whatever we lose, like you or me, it's
always ourselves that we find at sea."

01:05:22.084 --> 01:05:25.854
He didn't say much.
He never did say much.

01:05:25.856 --> 01:05:29.257
He always did more than he said.

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:49.244
Ryan...

01:05:49.246 --> 01:05:51.880
I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:05:51.882 --> 01:05:56.284
Listen, you want me to help take care
of the baby for a sec, or something?

01:06:01.424 --> 01:06:03.258
Nah, I'm gonna hold him.

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:05.427
Sure.

01:06:05.429 --> 01:06:07.295
Yeah, I'm gonna hold him.

01:06:09.231 --> 01:06:15.470
Ginny... you gonna be all right?

01:07:49.832 --> 01:07:54.869
It's not a gift, and you don't
owe me anything, either.

01:07:54.871 --> 01:07:57.272
It's me, paying you back.

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:04.979
I... Take it.

01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:18.393
I'm gonna make
good music on this.

01:08:18.395 --> 01:08:20.428
I know you will.

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:31.973
Oh!

01:08:33.274 --> 01:08:35.343
For Lia... right?

01:10:02.998 --> 01:10:05.533
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:08.970
Hey, Alfred, it's Jackie. I got
the documents that you sent over.

01:10:08.972 --> 01:10:11.139
Um, I'll be sure to look
them over before we meet.

01:10:11.141 --> 01:10:14.375
It's really exciting that the
condo already has an offer.

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:17.912
I'll see you tomorrow
morning at the property.

01:10:47.409 --> 01:10:49.744
<i>Welcome aboard flight 967...</i>

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:52.046
<i>to New York LaGuardia Airport.</i>

01:10:52.048 --> 01:10:55.583
<i>We should arrive at about</i>
<i>1:40 AM, local time...</i>

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.662
Okay.

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:21.469
Hi, how are you? Can I just
get a cup of coffee?

01:12:21.471 --> 01:12:23.004
Oh.

01:13:09.318 --> 01:13:12.920
How are you? Good.

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:25.833
Where am I gonna go next?
How am I gonna get there?

01:13:25.835 --> 01:13:31.305
Where am I gonna go next?
How am I gonna get there?

01:14:08.944 --> 01:14:10.878
Jackie, Jackie, hun?

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:15.883
Oh, thank you for doing
this so last minute.

01:14:15.885 --> 01:14:18.646
You were so proud when
you bought this place.

01:14:18.672 --> 01:14:20.087
I'm sorry to see it go.

01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:23.791
The tenants kept it in real, nice
shape, though, so it should show well.

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:28.563
Though there were these twins that got very
creative with one of the bedroom walls.

01:14:28.565 --> 01:14:33.835
But we'll just replace the appliances
and we should probably paint a little.

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:39.407
Did you talk to Wes, Alfred?

01:14:39.409 --> 01:14:44.612
Oh, yeah, Wes called and asked what time
we were meeting, so I told him, um...

01:14:44.614 --> 01:14:48.082
Oh... oh, I'm sorry,
I thought that he, uh...

01:14:48.084 --> 01:14:49.317
It's okay.

01:14:53.956 --> 01:14:55.590
Go.

01:14:55.592 --> 01:14:57.525
Jackie.

01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.894
Jackie!

01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:05.366
What?

01:15:09.304 --> 01:15:12.039
Do you even know
what you're doing?

01:15:15.644 --> 01:15:17.512
I guess we'll find out.

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:59.720
How much can you do for say,
three rooms?

01:16:02.658 --> 01:16:04.725
Knew you would.

01:16:05.527 --> 01:16:11.232
Jackie... Jackie.

01:16:23.745 --> 01:16:25.880
Buyer's final inspection
is the end of next week...

01:16:25.882 --> 01:16:29.917
so we gotta get you guys in
there to start the... painting...

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:16.697
Lia, honey, it's almost
time for supper.

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:54.802
Hey, Mom?

01:17:54.804 --> 01:17:56.971
Yeah, honey.

01:17:56.973 --> 01:17:59.106
Is it okay that he went?

01:17:59.108 --> 01:18:02.476
Yeah.

01:18:02.478 --> 01:18:06.814
Sometimes people just come
through to tell you something...

01:18:06.816 --> 01:18:10.317
and then once you heard it,
they go.

01:18:10.319 --> 01:18:12.186
Are you ever gonna go?

01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:13.988
From you?

01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:16.724
Unh-uh... never.

01:18:18.627 --> 01:18:23.297
I will be right here by you,
until you're ready to step away.

01:18:23.299 --> 01:18:26.467
And then I'll be right there where I am
for you if you ever need to come back.

01:18:26.469 --> 01:18:28.836
That's how that works, okay?

01:18:28.838 --> 01:18:30.538
Okay.

01:18:36.812 --> 01:18:37.945
Hey.

01:18:40.048 --> 01:18:43.384
Old German fiddle... Schweitzer?

01:18:43.386 --> 01:18:44.552
Where'd you get that shirt?

01:18:44.554 --> 01:18:46.153
Hey! Ryan! Hey!

01:18:46.155 --> 01:18:48.489
Oh, god. How are you?

01:18:48.491 --> 01:18:51.325
I'm great. Hey, everybody, this is my
friend Ryan I was telling you about.

01:18:51.327 --> 01:18:55.563
Would you like some coffee?
Thank you so much.

01:20:33.595 --> 01:20:35.262
Yeah, a little rough, huh?

01:20:35.264 --> 01:20:37.598
Yeah, I could work
on my bowing a little bit.

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:39.967
One second and we'll
be good to go.

01:20:39.969 --> 01:20:41.009
Okay.

01:20:49.311 --> 01:20:52.680
Tanner, king of the drop thumb.

01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:04.892
What's that?

01:21:08.029 --> 01:21:10.030
That sounds really good.

01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:15.536
Straight to F.

01:21:18.473 --> 01:21:20.207
Now D.

01:25:25.253 --> 01:25:27.788
<i>So you got any more like that?</i>

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:30.991
Yeah...

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:38.065
you want to hear them?
