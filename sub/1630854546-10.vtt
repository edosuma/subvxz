So, marty,

01:50.519 --> 01:52.778
Our drill program
this year encompassed

01:53.005 --> 01:55.021
All the areas that
we didn't drill before,

01:55.116 --> 01:57.007
And it's given us information

01:57.100 --> 01:58.342
In all the areas
we didn't have before.

01:58.435 --> 02:00.844
That new information suggests

02:00.863 --> 02:02.270
The garden shaft stands

02:02.289 --> 02:04.039
A chance at being the money pit.

02:06.685 --> 02:09.277

We've sampled wells

And we found gold
in, uh, the garden shaft.

(laughter)

02:32.302 --> 02:35.154
<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> Six weeks ago,</i>

02:35.381 --> 02:37.322
<i> A mining company named</i>
<i> dumas contracting ltd.</i>

02:37.549 --> 02:41.735
<i> To begin reconstructing</i>
<i> the garden shaft</i>

02:41.829 --> 02:45.497
<i> In order to find out</i>
<i> just what lies at the bottom.</i>

02:45.724 --> 02:47.891

02:47.910 --> 02:50.577
<i>The project is currently on hold</i>

02:50.729 --> 02:52.171
<i> Due to permitting issues</i>

02:57.920 --> 03:00.420
Steve:
Okay.

03:00.572 --> 03:02.072
There we go.

03:02.090 --> 03:03.849
Rick:
My thought on this is

03:04.000 --> 03:05.926
We have to have
a short-term plan

03:06.078 --> 03:08.687
Because once the garden shaft
project restarts,

03:08.914 --> 03:11.190
We are not going to be able
to do any more work

03:11.417 --> 03:13.174
In terms of drilling
assets in the area,

03:13.194 --> 03:14.751
So we need to gain

03:14.844 --> 03:16.586
As much information as we can

03:16.605 --> 03:18.363
About this area
around the garden shaft.

03:18.590 --> 03:20.257
Yeah.

03:20.350 --> 03:21.775
I'm where I've always
been this year,

03:21.869 --> 03:23.593
Which is, uh, follow the gold.

03:23.612 --> 03:25.204
-Yeah.
-Marty: I'm focused on

03:25.431 --> 03:27.781
Chasing that gold
to where it's coming from.

03:27.933 --> 03:29.766
I want to chase it.
I want to chase it hard.

03:29.785 --> 03:32.211
-Yes.
-Marty: Actually,

03:32.438 --> 03:34.120
We're kind of overdue to get
another gold report, aren't we?

03:34.215 --> 03:35.530
-Yeah.
-Scott: Yes.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.940
When these wells were drilled,

03:36.959 --> 03:39.125
They wanted to give those wells

03:39.220 --> 03:41.720
Several weeks to settle before
taking another round of samples.

03:41.947 --> 03:43.555
So, we have no new data
on the gold hunt

03:43.707 --> 03:46.558
-In the garden shaft area.
-No.

03:46.785 --> 03:47.634
So, we need to get some
science down there,

03:47.728 --> 03:48.727
Meaning water samples.

03:48.954 --> 03:49.970
Right.

03:51.139 --> 03:53.640
<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> In addition, the team</i>
<i> has also obtained</i>

03:53.792 --> 03:57.218
<i> Trace evidence of gold</i>
<i> in various concentrations</i>

03:57.312 --> 03:59.238
<i> From a number of boreholes</i>

03:59.465 --> 04:02.741
<i> In close proximity</i>
<i> to the garden shaft area.</i>

04:02.892 --> 04:06.820
<i> So now, they must attempt</i>
<i> to determine just where</i>

04:06.972 --> 04:10.415
<i>The ultimate source of potential</i>
<i>treasure may be hidden.</i>

04:10.567 --> 04:13.827
<i> Rick:</i>
<i> We did get some</i>
<i> high gold readings</i>

04:13.921 --> 04:17.071
<i> In close proximity</i>
<i> to the garden shaft,</i>

04:17.165 --> 04:19.165
<i> But we don't know where</i>

04:19.260 --> 04:21.818
<i> These high gold values</i>
<i> are coming from.</i>

04:21.837 --> 04:22.744
<i> So, I think we should be</i>

Chasing the gold
back to a source.

04:24.990 --> 04:25.747
"x" marks the spot.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.674
So, what do you want to do next?

04:27.768 --> 04:30.102
Um...

04:30.253 --> 04:32.178
Ian wants to take
some water samples,

04:32.331 --> 04:34.514
I believe, elevations
from the new wells

04:34.608 --> 04:36.333
Up right by the garden shaft.

04:36.426 --> 04:38.835
We'll go ahead
and pick some locations

04:38.854 --> 04:40.854
And make sure
everybody's on board.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.614
Okay.

04:42.841 --> 04:45.191
We've got to follow up
all these potential leads.

04:45.344 --> 04:46.693
-Right.
-Absolutely.

04:46.845 --> 04:48.269
<i> Marty:</i>
<i> It's entirely possible</i>

04:48.363 --> 04:49.937
<i> That the money pit</i>

04:50.032 --> 04:51.957
Is in or near the garden shaft.

<i> We need to apply</i>
<i> a lot of science there.</i>

04:53.961 --> 04:55.610
<i> We need some more sampling.</i>
<i> We need to chase the gold.</i>

04:55.629 --> 04:59.856
<i> If we get a firm target</i>
<i> near the garden shaft</i>

<i> in the water,</i>

05:01.710 --> 05:03.951

all on the same page now.

05:05.881 --> 05:07.697
-Yup.
-Yup.

05:07.716 --> 05:09.641

09:24.639 --> 09:26.639
It's in here somewhere.

09:26.792 --> 09:27.715
Ooh.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.142
Is that pottery?

09:29.236 --> 09:31.570
Gary:
I think it might be.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.131
If it's pottery,

09:35.150 --> 09:38.559
It's a... A weird design.

09:38.653 --> 09:40.579

It's pottery. Glazed.

09:40.730 --> 09:41.705

No. Way the hell down there.

09:49.590 --> 09:50.571
-Yeah.
-Marty: Maybe you
should look around

09:50.665 --> 09:51.906
In there for more pottery?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.983
I'll take a look.

09:54.077 --> 09:57.095
-Rick: There actually is.
-All right.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.323
Oh, my. Bigger pieces.

10:00.342 --> 10:01.582
But look how degraded it is.

10:01.676 --> 10:03.159
Gary:
Yeah, it is, huh?

10:03.252 --> 10:04.752
It's not the same
as that other piece.

10:04.771 --> 10:05.995
There's more, too.

10:06.089 --> 10:07.939
Marty:
Keep digging, rick.

10:08.166 --> 10:10.275
Actually, there's
quite a bit more.

10:10.426 --> 10:12.593
Wow, that's some nice
pieces of pottery, isn't it?

10:12.687 --> 10:15.188

There's a series
of standard designs.

11:13.656 --> 11:15.231
You can actually
date the designs.

11:15.250 --> 11:17.400
These, definitely,
because of the decoration.

11:17.419 --> 11:19.511
-Marty: Okay.
-That's called "press molded,"

11:19.738 --> 11:22.347
And this sort of press
molding started in 1740.

11:22.498 --> 11:22.997

12:11.565 --> 12:14.548
It wasn't the cheapest
pottery around.

12:14.642 --> 12:16.050
No, because of
the decoration on it.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.218

Yeah, it was highly decorated.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.540

13:48.144 --> 13:51.478

that is interesting.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.889
So, what you
intend to do here

13:52.907 --> 13:54.332
Is to draw some samples

13:54.559 --> 13:56.075
-For gold.
-Gold.

13:56.227 --> 13:58.336
-Yeah.
-Ian: Yeah.

13:58.487 --> 14:00.746
So, if wood's down there,
somebody was doing something,

14:00.899 --> 14:03.232
And so, what we noticed

14:03.251 --> 14:05.510
Last year with the gold
was we primarily found it

14:05.737 --> 14:08.754
At sites that were
connected or disturbed.

14:08.907 --> 14:10.590
We sampled it already once.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.259
We want to continue to sample
to see if it changes

14:13.411 --> 14:14.352
Hydraulic gradient.

14:14.503 --> 14:16.337
If we can find

14:16.356 --> 14:18.264
An isolated area with high gold,

14:18.358 --> 14:20.191
Then it's very likely

14:20.418 --> 14:23.436
There was some human
activity that was involved.

14:23.530 --> 14:27.348
Any information we get here,
I would think

14:27.367 --> 14:29.275
That you would both
also want to take samples

14:29.427 --> 14:31.185
From the garden shaft, right?

14:31.204 --> 14:32.537
Ian: Absolutely.
It has to be done.

14:32.688 --> 14:36.332
So, this is k-15.5

14:38.194 --> 14:39.526
Matt:
So, we need to
weight it a little bit

14:39.546 --> 14:40.194
To get it to drop
through the water.

14:40.288 --> 14:43.122
-Good.
-Matt: Yeah.

14:43.274 --> 14:44.716
Ian:
So, we'll see how this goes.

14:47.036 --> 14:50.204
So, this hole goes to 115,

14:50.223 --> 14:52.724
So, we'll try
to get down to 110.

is we get a nice clear sample.

So I'll clean off a bit
of the surface,

18:04.733 --> 18:06.325
And then I'll take
a very small sample,

18:06.419 --> 18:08.068
And then, uh,

18:08.162 --> 18:09.161
We will see what we find.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.737
Sounds great.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.906
Christa:
We don't need very much at all

18:12.926 --> 18:15.484
For sem analysis.

18:15.578 --> 18:17.428
<i>Rick:</i>
<i>I remain consistent in my belief</i>

18:17.580 --> 18:20.264
<i> That there are answers</i>
<i> in the swamp, and I'm hoping</i>

18:20.416 --> 18:23.676
<i> This technology might reveal</i>
<i> some of those answers.</i>

18:23.828 --> 18:24.918
Christa:
All right.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.438
I think the anomaly, zena's map,

18:27.590 --> 18:30.942
And the data to date
suggests something is there.

18:31.169 --> 18:32.276
Hey, xiang.

18:32.428 --> 18:33.594
-How are you doing today?
-Hello.

<i> Dr. Brosseau</i>

18:34.597 --> 18:37.356

18:37.508 --> 18:38.691
<i> Will examine the iron sample</i>

18:38.843 --> 18:40.267
<i> Under a high-powered</i>

18:40.361 --> 18:41.510
<i> Scanning electron microscope,</i>

18:41.529 --> 18:43.770
<i> Or sem,</i>

18:43.790 --> 18:46.365
<i> That can not only</i>
<i> magnify objects</i>

18:46.459 --> 18:50.369
<i> Up to 200,000 times</i>
<i> their actual size,</i>

18:50.521 --> 18:53.372
<i> But also determine</i>
<i> its chemical composition.</i>

18:53.524 --> 18:57.284
We'll see what we find here.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.863
So, with iron,
it's a bit tricky.

19:00.956 --> 19:03.716
There are some
indicators of age.

19:03.868 --> 19:06.552
One that we often
look at is manganese.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.295
If we see manganese, uh,

19:08.314 --> 19:11.298
It's often a flag
for a modern iron.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.818
And here,
we don't see manganese.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.729
So, that's a good indication
that you're looking at

19:16.823 --> 19:18.898
Something that's likely older.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.216
Okay.

19:20.234 --> 19:22.067
Christa:
We do see sulfur,

19:22.162 --> 19:23.494
Which is quite large.

19:23.721 --> 19:27.573
You typically see iron ores
with a high sulfur content

19:27.667 --> 19:30.001
Between 1700 and 1750.

19:32.172 --> 19:35.231
Of course, it can come
from a sulfur-rich environment.

19:35.249 --> 19:37.416
Yeah, it's on
the edge of the swamp,

19:37.510 --> 19:39.493
-Is where we found this.
-Christa: On the edge
of the swamp.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.570
Kind of deep, so there
might be sulfur in that.

19:41.664 --> 19:43.088
There's a lot of swamp...
Actually, yeah.

19:43.241 --> 19:44.665
I like to take soil samples

19:44.684 --> 19:45.999
Anytime there's
an artifact extracted.

19:46.093 --> 19:48.186
-Right.
-Emma: But yeah, the swamp,

19:48.337 --> 19:50.504
I do remember
high contents of sulfur.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.915
So, likely, it's from
a local environment.

19:52.934 --> 19:54.650
-Yeah.
-Christa: Hmm.

19:55.695 --> 19:59.346
Peter:
So, if the sulfur is in the soil

19:59.365 --> 20:02.758
And it's not
from the metal itself,

20:02.851 --> 20:04.927
It's potentially
even older than 1700?

20:04.946 --> 20:06.829
Yes, it could be.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.956
Peter: So, it's potentially
even older than 1700?

20:17.050 --> 20:19.366
Yes, but I would do
a section to confirm.

20:19.385 --> 20:20.943
Okay.

20:41.799 --> 20:43.491
<i> By more than a century.</i>

20:47.638 --> 20:51.231
Yeah. When we see
phosphorus in an iron ore,

20:51.251 --> 20:52.750
It's called "phosphoric iron."

20:54.161 --> 20:56.645
Typically, the phosphorus
is original to the ore,

20:56.739 --> 20:59.072
And it hasn't been
removed in smelting.

20:59.166 --> 21:01.509
Very common in, um,
medieval europe.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.489
Very common in northern britain,

21:06.582 --> 21:08.991
Because iron ore
from that region,

21:09.010 --> 21:11.585
Historically, has been
rich in phosphorus, so...

21:11.679 --> 21:13.587

a lot of the artifacts

21:13.606 --> 21:15.514

21:20.613 --> 21:23.506
I was in royston cave.

21:23.524 --> 21:25.508
There was physical evidence

21:25.601 --> 21:27.618

Yeah. Might get a rose head.

27:06.125 --> 27:07.107
It'll be nice to clean that up.

27:07.201 --> 27:09.184
It's hand-forged?

27:09.277 --> 27:11.353
Helen: Uh, yeah.
Which kind of suggests

27:11.372 --> 27:13.205
Boat building, doesn't it,
with copper nails?

27:13.357 --> 27:15.782
Laird:
Yeah, because it's, uh,
it resists corrosion.

27:15.801 --> 27:17.376
Yeah, and salt water.

27:17.528 --> 27:20.863
<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> A rose-headed copper nail?</i>

27:20.881 --> 27:23.882
<i> Dating back to</i>
<i> as early as 3500 bc,</i>

27:24.034 --> 27:27.811
<i> Hand-forged copper nails</i>
<i> were first used</i>

27:27.963 --> 27:30.539
<i> By the ancient</i>
<i> egyptians and romans</i>

27:30.557 --> 27:31.390
<i> For the construction</i>
<i> of large sailing vessels</i>

27:31.542 --> 27:34.300
<i> In order to ensure durability</i>

27:34.320 --> 27:35.986
<i> While on long journeys at sea.</i>

27:36.138 --> 27:40.473
<i> Over the past decade,</i>
<i> the oak island team</i>

27:40.493 --> 27:43.568
<i> Has unearthed a number</i>
<i> of ship-related artifacts,</i>

27:43.663 --> 27:46.738
<i> Such as wood fragments and</i>
<i> decking spikes in the swamp,</i>

27:46.832 --> 27:49.892
<i> That have ranged from as late</i>
<i> as the 18th century</i>

27:49.985 --> 27:52.002
<i> To as early as</i>
<i> the 3rd century ad.</i>

27:52.154 --> 27:57.675
<i>Could this copper nail</i>
<i>be related to those discoveries,</i>

27:57.826 --> 28:00.010
<i> As well as the evidence</i>
<i> of a possible dam?</i>

28:00.237 --> 28:01.920
<i> And if so,</i>

28:02.014 --> 28:04.330
<i> Might it also be connected</i>
<i> to the hammered coin</i>

28:04.350 --> 28:07.351
<i> That was found on lot 5</i>
<i> two weeks ago,</i>

28:07.578 --> 28:10.354
<i> Which is believed</i>
<i> to be of roman origin?</i>

28:10.505 --> 28:12.264
That's a really cool find.

28:12.416 --> 28:13.582
It is.

28:13.600 --> 28:16.418
We're finding some really,
really cool stuff

28:16.437 --> 28:19.254
Just in this one
little area, so, I think

28:19.347 --> 28:21.347
-We need to keep going.
-Miriam: Yeah, for sure.

28:21.442 --> 28:23.349
What's going on in lot 5?

28:23.444 --> 28:24.760
Laird (chucking):
Right?

28:24.853 --> 28:25.761
<i> Marty:</i>
<i> I'm convinced lot 5</i>

28:25.854 --> 28:27.763
<i> Is something significant,</i>

28:27.856 --> 28:29.355
<i> Either just historically,</i>

28:29.375 --> 28:32.601
<i> Or maybe in our treasure hunt.</i>

28:32.619 --> 28:34.360
<i> So, it makes this area</i>

28:34.380 --> 28:36.455
Extremely important
and extremely interesting

28:36.607 --> 28:38.298
For us to figure out.

28:39.552 --> 28:40.867
Laird:
Wow.

28:40.886 --> 28:42.869
You can almost see a clear line,

28:42.888 --> 28:43.612
Right where your right foot is.

28:43.630 --> 28:45.889
-Here. Yeah.
-Yeah.

28:46.116 --> 28:48.726
Laird: I mean, it's turning out
to be really something else.

28:48.877 --> 28:51.044
Helen:
It's looking like some sort
of fairly large feature

28:51.138 --> 28:52.287
That we have going on here.

28:52.306 --> 28:54.047
-Laird: Yeah.
-Helen: Yeah.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.049
So, our current thinking is that

28:56.068 --> 28:58.736
There was something here

28:58.887 --> 29:01.071
Pre-1770s?

29:01.298 --> 29:02.981
Wow.

29:03.133 --> 29:04.649
Laird:
And then, it was
intentionally buried.

29:04.802 --> 29:06.726
For whatever reason.

29:06.820 --> 29:08.804
The fill is old,
but the feature could be

29:08.897 --> 29:09.988
-Even older.
-Helen: Even older. Yeah.

29:10.140 --> 29:11.823
Wow.

29:11.976 --> 29:13.475
<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> If archaeologist laird niven</i>

29:13.568 --> 29:15.902
<i> Is correct</i>

29:15.996 --> 29:19.423
<i> Which predates the money pit</i>
<i> by several decades or more,</i>

29:19.650 --> 29:22.909
<i> Was purposely buried,</i>
<i> then what was it used for</i>

29:23.003 --> 29:27.247
<i> That compelled whoever created</i>
<i> it to hide its existence?</i>

29:27.266 --> 29:29.767
Any find on lot 5 at this point,

29:29.918 --> 29:32.995
Especially anything that,
again, is pre-depositional,

29:33.088 --> 29:35.347
Yes, it's exceedingly
interesting.

29:35.499 --> 29:38.834
<i> I think there are</i>
<i> some very good clues</i>

29:38.927 --> 29:41.686
<i> As to what may have</i>
<i> happened on oak island</i>

29:41.839 --> 29:44.764
<i> That are still</i>
<i> underground on lot 5,</i>

29:44.784 --> 29:47.117
<i> And we're nowhere near done.</i>

29:47.344 --> 29:48.952
I think there's more
yet to be revealed.

29:51.198 --> 29:52.848
Laird:
This was, uh, not just
a cabin in the woods.

29:52.941 --> 29:54.941
-Miriam: Yeah.
-This was something

29:55.035 --> 29:56.776
A little more
substantial than that.

29:56.870 --> 29:59.037
-Really cool.
-Helen: Nice.

29:59.189 --> 29:59.946

-Emma: It was good

30:11.552 --> 30:12.625
And really instructive.

30:12.719 --> 30:14.127

30:14.221 --> 30:15.795

30:25.807 --> 30:27.324
Tom: This very well could be

30:27.475 --> 30:28.641
A piece of what
we're looking for

30:28.661 --> 30:31.311
In the swamp,
so I'm interested to see

30:31.330 --> 30:32.812
What you can tell us about that.

30:32.832 --> 30:34.832
Uh, yeah, so,

30:34.983 --> 30:37.483
This iron pin, there is
some phosphorous in it.

30:37.578 --> 30:39.670
-Wow.
-The phosphor content

30:39.821 --> 30:41.821
Usually comes from England

30:41.841 --> 30:44.490
And, kind of,
northern european areas.

30:44.510 --> 30:45.658
And there is a content

30:45.678 --> 30:47.344
Of sulfur, which makes it old.

30:47.495 --> 30:50.163
-Mm-hmm.
-Like 1700s or earlier.

30:50.182 --> 30:52.850
Doug:
When you say, "earlier,"

30:53.077 --> 30:54.759
Could that fit
a "1200" timeframe?

30:54.912 --> 30:56.353
Yeah.

30:58.023 --> 31:00.673
Emma:
So, I did some research,

31:00.693 --> 31:03.026
And the phosphorous
could come from bog iron.

31:03.253 --> 31:05.511
So, bog iron is the earliest
forms of iron that you use.

31:05.606 --> 31:06.938
-Doug: Right.
-Tom: Well, obviously

31:07.091 --> 31:08.940
That's kind of the date
we like to see,

31:09.093 --> 31:10.516
-You know?
-Yeah.

31:10.536 --> 31:11.869
Because it predates
everything, you know?

31:12.020 --> 31:13.428
-Emma: Mm-hmm.
-Settlement, searchers.

31:13.521 --> 31:15.188
Then you're-you're going
back to whoever did this,

31:15.282 --> 31:17.541
Which is what
we'd all like to know,

31:17.692 --> 31:20.602
Rather we get back
to 1200 or where we are,

31:20.621 --> 31:23.105
So I think it's
a really important item.

31:23.198 --> 31:24.030
It was probably used
to put something together.

31:24.049 --> 31:27.125
Yeah.

31:27.277 --> 31:28.868
Uh, it's starting to really
look like there's something

31:28.962 --> 31:30.220
-Along that beach.
-Yup.

31:30.447 --> 31:31.963
To me the thing is,

31:32.116 --> 31:33.539
When you look at zena's map,

31:33.559 --> 31:34.950
It says "dam."

31:35.969 --> 31:38.378
<i> And fred is saying</i>
<i> there's a wall there.</i>

31:38.397 --> 31:40.546
<i> Well, what is a dam?</i>

31:40.641 --> 31:43.066
<i> Essentially, a barrier against</i>
<i> movement of water. A dam.</i>

31:43.293 --> 31:46.978
So, I'm-I'm excited

31:47.072 --> 31:48.797
About the possibilities.

31:48.890 --> 31:51.909
My belief would be,
if the structure is there,

31:52.136 --> 31:55.971
It's original work, and that
would be a real "ah-ha" moment.

31:56.064 --> 31:59.732
It might even meet
the criteria of "the one thing."

31:59.752 --> 32:02.327
If zena's map is real,

32:02.479 --> 32:03.995
It's the best lead we have.

32:04.148 --> 32:05.571
-Correct.
<i>-Rick: But the very first thing</i>

32:05.591 --> 32:08.984
<i> Is target a zone</i>
<i> of interest, and then</i>

32:09.002 --> 32:11.319
<i>We need a permit to dig further</i>

32:11.338 --> 32:13.321
<i> Into the bog on lot 10</i>

32:13.340 --> 32:15.248
<i> To investigate these targets.</i>

32:15.342 --> 32:16.600
And how ironic.

32:16.751 --> 32:18.176
We went looking for a dam,

32:18.270 --> 32:19.603
And we found a damn good find.

32:19.754 --> 32:20.679
(laughter)

32:20.831 --> 32:22.347
My dad wrote a book

32:22.499 --> 32:25.016
About his exploration work
on the island,

32:25.110 --> 32:27.427
And, you know, I think

32:27.446 --> 32:29.004
I'm going to have
a look at the book

32:29.022 --> 32:30.781
A little closer because

32:30.932 --> 32:32.674
There could be information

32:32.693 --> 32:34.618
Just like this,
you know, possible dam

32:34.769 --> 32:37.179
We're looking at,
that may be helpful for us.

32:37.197 --> 32:38.938
Rick:
That'd be great, tom.

32:38.958 --> 32:40.532
I think you're
spot-on about that.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.275
I love the find,
but at the end of the day,

32:42.294 --> 32:43.627
What do we always say?

32:43.854 --> 32:45.963
The mystery
won't get solved here.

32:46.114 --> 32:47.355
So, I think everybody has
something to do, let's go do it.

That's a ship
sort of thing, isn't it?

34:05.118 --> 34:07.769
Yeah, it's normally associated
with boat building

34:07.788 --> 34:08.861
Because they don't corrode
as much in salt water.

34:08.881 --> 34:10.789

of it right now.

-Okay.

modern stuff mixed in with it.

-Which is really cool for us.

something here?

<i> Marty:</i>
<i> Excellent job, guys.</i>

35:24.623 --> 35:26.957
<i> Find some cool stuff.</i>

35:32.372 --> 35:35.023
<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> Two days later...</i>

35:35.116 --> 35:36.616
<i> -Scott: Hey, guys.</i>
<i> -Rick: Hi, guys.</i>

35:36.710 --> 35:37.876
-Ian: Hello.
<i> -Marty: Good day.</i>

35:37.970 --> 35:40.470
<i> This is the war room</i>
<i> I've been waiting for.</i>

35:40.622 --> 35:42.788
<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> ...Rick and marty lagina</i>

35:42.883 --> 35:44.307
<i> Have gathered members</i>
<i> of the team in the war room</i>

35:44.459 --> 35:47.369
<i> For a meeting with</i>
<i> dr. Ian spooner,</i>

35:47.387 --> 35:49.795
<i> Dr. Matt lukeman</i>

35:49.815 --> 35:53.875
<i> And their colleague,</i>
<i>hydrogeologist dr. Fred michel.</i>

35:53.894 --> 35:56.044
<i> I am all ears.</i>
<i> I want to know about the gold.</i>

35:56.137 --> 35:58.546
<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> After analyzing</i>

35:58.640 --> 36:00.657
<i> The recent water samples that</i>
<i> were collected from boreholes</i>

36:00.884 --> 36:03.718
<i> Near the garden shaft</i>
<i> in the money pit area,</i>

36:03.811 --> 36:06.721
<i> Dr. Spooner, dr. Lukeman</i>
<i> and dr. Michel</i>

36:06.814 --> 36:09.240
<i> Are ready to present</i>
<i> their findings</i>

36:09.393 --> 36:11.001
<i>Regarding the possible location</i>

36:11.228 --> 36:13.986
<i> Of the legendary</i>
<i> oak island treasure.</i>

36:14.006 --> 36:15.563
I'll turn it over to you,
dr. Spooner.

36:15.582 --> 36:18.233
Ian:
Thank you very much.

36:18.251 --> 36:18.900
Yeah, so right now,
we're looking at

36:18.919 --> 36:20.677
The money pit area,

36:20.828 --> 36:22.179
But what we're
really interested in

36:22.406 --> 36:24.681
Is in what's happening
in the garden shaft,

36:24.908 --> 36:26.850
Because we're trying
to find a source

36:27.001 --> 36:27.833
To where this gold
is coming from.

36:27.853 --> 36:28.927
Right.

36:29.079 --> 36:30.687
Ian:
We sent in a few samples

36:30.838 --> 36:32.838
From the monitoring wells,

36:32.858 --> 36:34.582
And those have been
from two depths:

36:34.601 --> 36:36.526
Around the 110,

36:36.678 --> 36:38.528
-And then around
the 150 intervals.
-Mm-hmm.

36:38.680 --> 36:40.088
Next slide, please.

36:40.106 --> 36:42.181
This is really fred's work,

36:42.201 --> 36:43.867
So, fred, you're here.

36:44.018 --> 36:46.611
Why don't you talk
a little bit about this?

36:46.705 --> 36:49.264
<i> Okay. Uh, well,</i>

36:49.282 --> 36:52.450
<i> The dashed black line</i>
<i> that you see there</i>

36:52.602 --> 36:55.787
<i>Is dividing two groups of water.</i>

36:55.939 --> 36:57.863
<i> The ones to the east,</i>

36:57.883 --> 37:00.866
<i> Those, for the most part,</i>
<i> we're not seeing</i>

37:00.886 --> 37:02.219
<i> Any gold or silver.</i>

37:03.947 --> 37:05.705
-Okay.
<i> -Michel: But we also</i>

37:05.799 --> 37:08.283
<i> Do have samples that go north</i>

37:08.301 --> 37:10.635
<i> Of where the grid is showing</i>
<i> in the garden shaft,</i>

37:10.729 --> 37:13.897
<i> And we're seeing gold</i>
<i> and silver in that area.</i>

37:15.383 --> 37:17.216
<i> So, we believe from</i>
<i> looking at the chemistry,</i>

37:17.310 --> 37:19.143
<i> That area is the area</i>

37:19.296 --> 37:21.296
<i>That we'd be most interested in.</i>

37:21.314 --> 37:23.073
Ian:
Yep.

37:23.224 --> 37:24.199
The next slide, steve.

37:27.153 --> 37:29.729
So, this is the last slide,

37:29.748 --> 37:31.748
And perhaps the one
we should think about.

37:31.899 --> 37:33.992
To cut to the chase,

37:34.086 --> 37:36.086
The area in pink there

37:36.237 --> 37:38.738
Would be exactly
where the gold is.

37:38.757 --> 37:39.923
<i> Marty:</i>
<i> Wow.</i>

37:41.651 --> 37:43.093
<i> Fantastic.</i>

37:47.991 --> 37:50.158
<i> Ian: So, the area</i>
<i> in pink there,</i>

37:50.176 --> 37:54.437
Is the area that is
most of interest to us.

37:54.589 --> 37:56.922
Now it's time
to chase down the gold.

37:56.942 --> 37:59.167
Exactly.

37:59.260 --> 38:00.092
<i> That is just really</i>
<i> interesting and great.</i>

38:00.112 --> 38:01.002
Yeah.

38:01.021 --> 38:02.261
<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> In the war room,</i>

38:02.281 --> 38:03.429
<i> The oak island team</i>

38:03.523 --> 38:04.781
<i> Has just been informed</i>

38:05.008 --> 38:06.508
<i> By hydrogeologist</i>
<i> dr. Fred michel</i>

38:06.526 --> 38:10.269
<i> That, according to</i>
<i> water sample testing,</i>

38:10.363 --> 38:12.104
<i> The source of silver and gold</i>

38:12.198 --> 38:13.272
<i> They have been trying to</i>

38:13.366 --> 38:15.366
<i> Pinpoint in the money pit area</i>

38:15.460 --> 38:17.018
<i> Appears to be in a location</i>

38:17.037 --> 38:19.129
<i>Very close to the garden shaft.</i>

38:19.356 --> 38:21.706
<i> Most of our</i>
<i> gold and silver values,</i>

38:21.800 --> 38:23.967
<i> We're seeing in the shallow</i>

38:24.194 --> 38:25.360
<i> Monitoring wells.</i>

38:25.378 --> 38:28.046
<i> The 80 to 110 foot area</i>

38:28.198 --> 38:29.622
<i> Is the area that</i>
<i> this is coming from.</i>

38:29.641 --> 38:31.141
<i> That's right.</i>

38:31.368 --> 38:33.125
<i> Marty: Can we reach</i>
<i> that conclusion,</i>

38:33.145 --> 38:35.203
<i> That wherever this is</i>
<i> coming from, it's shallow?</i>

38:35.221 --> 38:37.797
<i> That's certainly what we're</i>
<i> seeing in the data right now.</i>

38:37.891 --> 38:39.632
<i> That is astoundingly good news</i>

38:39.726 --> 38:41.484
<i> For our search at this point.</i>

38:41.636 --> 38:42.986
<i> I mean, it's a lot easier</i>
<i> to chase it</i>

38:43.213 --> 38:44.779
<i> -Shallow, too, right?</i>
<i> -Yes.</i>

38:46.307 --> 38:47.640
That's kind of interesting

38:47.734 --> 38:49.233
Because these
are levels that match

38:49.328 --> 38:51.161
-The 90 foot stone.
-Yeah.

38:52.906 --> 38:54.389
<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> In 1804,</i>

38:54.482 --> 38:56.574
<i> When members of</i>
<i> the onslow company</i>

38:56.726 --> 38:58.818
<i> Removed the legendary</i>
<i> 90 foot stone</i>

38:58.837 --> 39:01.729
<i> From the ninth oak platform</i>
<i> in the money pit,</i>

39:01.748 --> 39:04.248
<i>They probed the soil beneath it,</i>

39:04.401 --> 39:06.067
<i> And struck a flat,</i>

39:06.086 --> 39:07.493
<i> Wooden surface</i>
<i> some ten feet below.</i>

39:07.512 --> 39:10.830
<i>The discovery made them certain</i>

39:10.849 --> 39:12.407
<i>That they were about to recover</i>

39:12.425 --> 39:15.243
<i> A vault packed</i>
<i> with untold riches.</i>

39:15.336 --> 39:17.579
<i> But unfortunately,</i>
<i> their hopes were dashed</i>

39:17.597 --> 39:20.582
<i> As the pit suddenly</i>
<i> filled with seawater</i>

39:20.600 --> 39:23.360
<i> From the believed</i>
<i> man-made flood tunnel</i>

39:23.511 --> 39:26.029
<i> Originating at</i>
<i> nearby smith's cove.</i>

39:26.681 --> 39:30.033
<i> Is it possible</i>
<i> that the oak island team</i>

39:30.260 --> 39:32.110
<i> Is narrowing in</i>
<i> on what those searchers</i>

39:32.262 --> 39:34.612
<i> Could not reach more</i>
<i> than two centuries ago?</i>

39:34.764 --> 39:36.431
<i> Rick:</i>
<i> The findings of</i>
<i> the highest gold values</i>

39:36.449 --> 39:39.100
<i> Between 80 and 110 feet,</i>

39:39.193 --> 39:41.769
It replicates the old story
of the money pit.

39:41.788 --> 39:43.605
<i> They were absolutely convinced</i>

39:43.623 --> 39:46.383
<i> There was treasure</i>
<i> at that depth.</i>

39:46.610 --> 39:49.386
<i> How do we find what they</i>
<i> thought they found long ago?</i>

39:49.613 --> 39:51.629
That's yet to come.

39:51.781 --> 39:54.298
<i>I mean, look, I'm all for this.</i>
<i> We should chase that.</i>

39:54.451 --> 39:57.394
<i> Onward and into</i>
<i> that blob area we go.</i>

39:57.545 --> 39:59.229
Steve:
So, just for reference,

39:59.380 --> 40:02.023
We're 10, 15 feet
just west of the garden shaft.

40:03.384 --> 40:05.960
I'm going to put my cursor
so everybody can see

40:05.979 --> 40:07.478
What marty's calling
the "blob" area

40:07.572 --> 40:09.388
Is essentially this area here.

40:09.408 --> 40:12.391
It might go
a little farther west.

40:12.485 --> 40:13.484
The blob is the likeliest spot
where the gold is coming from,

40:13.578 --> 40:16.804
<i> The origination of the gold.</i>

40:16.823 --> 40:18.322
<i> I am extremely excited.</i>

40:18.417 --> 40:20.917
<i> Everything that is</i>
<i> presented in the war room</i>

40:21.144 --> 40:22.401
<i> Seems to indicate</i>
<i> that we're closing in</i>

40:22.421 --> 40:24.421
On where the treasure could be.

40:24.648 --> 40:25.980
<i> This is something</i>
<i> that absolutely</i>

40:25.999 --> 40:27.999
<i> Has to be followed up.</i>

40:28.151 --> 40:30.093
<i> Rick, unless there's something</i>
<i> I'm missing something,</i>

40:30.244 --> 40:32.820
<i> Is there any other reason we</i>
<i>couldn't drill this right away?</i>

40:32.839 --> 40:33.596
No, we need to get on this asap

40:33.823 --> 40:36.507
And get the best data possible.

40:36.601 --> 40:38.009
-Yup.
-Rick: Marty, we'll, uh,

40:38.103 --> 40:40.270
We'll get this project underway.

40:40.421 --> 40:42.680
<i> Good. Good.</i>
<i> Let's go, let's do it.</i>

40:42.832 --> 40:44.941
<i> Onward and into the blob.</i>

40:45.092 --> 40:46.276
(laughter)

40:46.503 --> 40:47.760
Rick:
All righty, we'll see you.

40:47.854 --> 40:49.337
-We'll let you know.
<i> -Marty: Yeah.</i>

40:49.430 --> 40:50.613
<i> -Thank you.</i>
<i> -Rick: See you, guys.</i>

40:50.840 --> 40:52.264
<i> -Ian: See you.</i>
<i> -Rick: Bye-bye.</i>

40:52.358 --> 40:56.786
<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> After more than a decade</i>
<i> of faithful searching,</i>

40:57.013 --> 40:59.939
<i> And thanks to their team</i>
<i> of diverse experts,</i>

41:00.033 --> 41:02.517
<i> Rick, marty, and craig</i>

41:02.535 --> 41:04.018
<i> May now be closing in on</i>

41:04.037 --> 41:05.628
<i> What the oak island money pit</i>

41:05.855 --> 41:09.114
<i> Has kept secret for</i>
<i> more than two centuries.</i>

41:09.209 --> 41:11.876
<i> But now, as they move forward</i>

41:11.970 --> 41:14.804
<i> To reveal what lies</i>
<i> deep below ground,</i>

41:15.031 --> 41:17.957
<i> Will it lead</i>
<i> to the ultimate reward?</i>

41:18.051 --> 41:21.202
<i> Or will it lead</i>

41:21.221 --> 41:23.646
<i>To their greatest challenge yet?</i>

41:26.543 --> 41:28.985
<i> Next time on</i>
the curse of oak island...

41:29.136 --> 41:30.970
<i> Marty:</i>
<i> We are drilling in the blob</i>

41:31.064 --> 41:32.213
<i> Where the gold is coming from.</i>

41:32.232 --> 41:33.731
Terry:
Ho. Look at this.

41:33.883 --> 41:35.399
Oh, my god.

41:35.552 --> 41:37.719
Rick, you've been looking
for this for a long time.

41:37.737 --> 41:39.162
Jack:
Oh, yeah.

41:39.313 --> 41:40.738
Corjan:
That is the mark of the masons

41:40.890 --> 41:42.165
-For the knights templar.
-Charles: Oh, wow.

41:42.392 --> 41:43.908
Could be from
a medieval templar church.

41:44.002 --> 41:46.652
The date I got was 1028 to 1172.

41:46.671 --> 41:48.171
Jack:
Oh, no way.

41:48.398 --> 41:50.064
That is really cool.
12th century, right?

41:50.083 --> 41:51.490
-Even earlier.
-Doug: Yeah.
-Yup.

41:51.510 --> 41:52.734
Templars, baby.
