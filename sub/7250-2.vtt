18:37.450 --> 18:40.661
VEGETARIANS IN HERE ANYMORE.

18:40.703 --> 18:42.956
NO,<i> YOU</i> SAID YOU WEREN'T LETTING

18:40.703 --> 18:42.956
VEGETARIANS IN.

18:42.997 --> 18:45.750
I'M MAKING MY BAKED

18:42.997 --> 18:45.750
STUFFED PORK CHOPS FOR TONIGHT.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.961
MAKE SOMETHING ELSE

18:45.792 --> 18:47.961
FOR THE LASSANOS.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.961
LIKE WHAT?

18:48.002 --> 18:49.921
I DON'T KNOW -- PASTA.

18:48.002 --> 18:49.921
YOU MAKE GREAT PASTA.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.048
BUT THAT'S BORING.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.048
ANYONE CAN MAKE PASTA.

18:52.090 --> 18:56.135
I'M AN ARTIST. YOU DON'T DICTATE

18:52.090 --> 18:56.135
TO AN ARTIST. YOU DON'T TELL

18:52.090 --> 18:56.135
THEM WHAT TO DO.

18:56.176 --> 19:00.473
NO ONE WALKS UP TO DEGAS AND

18:56.176 --> 19:00.473
SAID, "HEY, EASY WITH THE

18:56.176 --> 19:00.473
DANCERS. ENOUGH ALREADY.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.976
DRAW A NICE FRUIT BOWL

19:00.514 --> 19:02.976
ONCE IN A WHILE."

19:03.017 --> 19:06.104
A GREAT ARTIST CAN MAKE ART

19:03.017 --> 19:06.104
OUT OF ANYTHING,

19:03.017 --> 19:06.104
INCLUDING PASTA.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.897
FINE, PASTA. WHOO-HOO.

19:07.939 --> 19:09.857
IS THERE COFFEE?

19:07.939 --> 19:09.857
JUST MADE SOME.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.400
SO, TODAY'S YOUR LUNCH

19:09.899 --> 19:11.400
WITH EMILY.

19:11.442 --> 19:13.027
ANY IDEA

19:11.442 --> 19:13.027
WHAT SHE'S GONNA SAY?

19:13.069 --> 19:15.404
I BET IT'S NOT,

19:13.069 --> 19:15.404
"I'M JOINING THE CIRCUS.

19:15.446 --> 19:18.032
FEED YOUR FATHER

19:15.446 --> 19:18.032
UNTIL I GET BACK."

19:15.446 --> 19:18.032
I SHOULD CANCEL.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.909
YOU CAN'T! YOU'RE MEETING

19:18.074 --> 19:19.909
IN AN HOUR.

19:19.951 --> 19:22.036
BUT THIS GOES

19:19.951 --> 19:22.036
AGAINST EVERY RULE I HAVE

19:22.078 --> 19:23.329
IN THE GILMORE SURVIVAL GUIDE.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.998
NUMBER ONE --

19:23.370 --> 19:24.998
NO RUNNING WITH SCISSORS,

19:25.039 --> 19:26.749
NUMBER TWO --

19:25.039 --> 19:26.749
NO PAGEBOY HAIRCUTS,

19:26.791 --> 19:29.293
NUMBER THREE -- NEVER, EVER HAVE

19:26.791 --> 19:29.293
LUNCH ALONE WITH THE MOTHER.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.920
IT MIGHT NOT

19:29.335 --> 19:30.920
BE SO BAD.

19:30.962 --> 19:32.588
SAYING YES TO THIS LUNCH

19:32.630 --> 19:35.257
IS LIKE SAYING, "SOUNDS FUN"

19:32.630 --> 19:35.257
TO A RIDE WITH CLEMENZA.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.301
THINK GOOD THOUGHTS.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.301
SHE COULD SURPRISE YOU.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.719
I GUESS.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.972
PEOPLE CHANGE, YOU KNOW.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.972
THEY DO IT EVERY DAY.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.515
ONE MINUTE,

19:41.014 --> 19:42.515
YOU COULD BE,

19:42.556 --> 19:45.309
OH, LET'S SAY A VEGETARIAN,

19:42.556 --> 19:45.309
AND THE NEXT MINUTE,

19:45.351 --> 19:48.104
YOU COULD ACCIDENTALLY HAVE

19:45.351 --> 19:48.104
A BITE OF A STUFFED PORK CHOP

19:48.146 --> 19:49.897
THAT CHANGES

19:48.146 --> 19:49.897
YOUR ENTIRE WAY OF THINKING.

19:49.939 --> 19:52.066
SOOKIE...

19:49.939 --> 19:52.066
SUDDENLY LIFE'S FUN.

19:52.108 --> 19:55.277
THERE'S A REASON

19:52.108 --> 19:55.277
TO GET UP IN THE MORNING.

19:52.108 --> 19:55.277
IT'S CALLED "BACON"!

19:55.319 --> 19:56.570
FORGET IT!

19:55.319 --> 19:56.570
COME ON!

19:56.612 --> 20:00.658
PASTA.

19:56.612 --> 20:00.658
LET THE PEOPLE GROW,

19:56.612 --> 20:00.658
DAMN IT!

20:07.456 --> 20:09.959
RORY, HI.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.959
NICE OF YOU TO JOIN US.

20:10.001 --> 20:12.920
FRANCIE, I --

20:10.001 --> 20:12.920
NO,<i> I</i> TALK, OKAY? GREAT.

20:12.962 --> 20:16.007
NOW, LET'S DISCUSS PARIS.

20:12.962 --> 20:16.007
WHAT ABOUT HER?

20:16.049 --> 20:18.134
SHE SEEMS TO HAVE

20:16.049 --> 20:18.134
THE VERY STRANGE IDEA

20:18.176 --> 20:20.011
THAT SHE'S ACTUALLY

20:18.176 --> 20:20.011
IN CHARGE AROUND HERE,

20:20.053 --> 20:23.597
I THOUGHT IT WOULD

20:20.053 --> 20:23.597
BE GOOD TO LET YOU IN

20:20.053 --> 20:23.597
ON A LITTLE SECRET.

20:23.639 --> 20:26.017
SHE'S NOT.

20:23.639 --> 20:26.017
TELL HER THIS YOURSELF.

20:26.059 --> 20:30.646
TALKING TO PARIS

20:26.059 --> 20:30.646
IS LIKE SHOPPING FOR

20:26.059 --> 20:30.646
A BATHING SUIT IN DECEMBER --

20:30.688 --> 20:33.357
FRUSTRATING, FRUITLESS,

20:30.688 --> 20:33.357
AND A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.

20:33.399 --> 20:34.692
NO. YOU.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.777
YOU MIGHT BE THE WALLFLOWER,

20:36.819 --> 20:39.488
BUT YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY

20:36.819 --> 20:39.488
THE MEYER LANSKY

20:36.819 --> 20:39.488
BEHIND THIS ORGANIZATION.

20:39.530 --> 20:41.866
I AM<i> NOT</i> THE MEYER LANSKY.

20:39.530 --> 20:41.866
WHAT'S THAT NOISE?

20:41.908 --> 20:43.910
WHAT IS THAT NOISE?

20:43.951 --> 20:45.953
OH, WAIT --

20:43.951 --> 20:45.953
IT'S ME STILL TALKING.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.997
DIDN'T YOU HEAR IT?

20:45.995 --> 20:47.997
OBVIOUSLY NOT.

20:48.039 --> 20:50.249
ANYHOW, PARIS IS

20:48.039 --> 20:50.249
STUDENT-BODY PRESIDENT.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.626
BIG, FAT DEAL.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.754
THERE ARE THREE OTHER

20:52.668 --> 20:54.754
CLASS PRESIDENTS --

20:54.795 --> 20:57.965
THE JUNIOR-CLASS PRESIDENT,

20:54.795 --> 20:57.965
THE SOPHOMORE-CLASS PRESIDENT,

20:58.007 --> 21:01.094
AND, OH, YES,

20:58.007 --> 21:01.094
THE SENIOR-CLASS PRESIDENT, ME.

21:01.135 --> 21:04.388
I KNOW ALL THIS.

21:01.135 --> 21:04.388
THEN IT'S OFF

21:01.135 --> 21:04.388
THE SHORT BUS FOR YOU.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.224
IF PARIS THINKS

21:04.430 --> 21:06.224
SHE'S GONNA MARCH AROUND

21:06.265 --> 21:08.851
DICTATING MANDATES

21:06.265 --> 21:08.851
AND IGNORING WHAT<i> I</i> HAVE TO SAY,

21:08.893 --> 21:10.978
THEN SHE'S IN

21:08.893 --> 21:10.978
FOR A MAJOR BIKINI WAX.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.188
THANKS FOR THE VISUAL.

21:12.230 --> 21:14.232
WITHOUT ME, SHE'S NOTHING,

21:14.314 --> 21:18.485
JUST ANOTHER POWER-MAD,

21:14.314 --> 21:18.485
INSECURE, FRIENDLESS, DATELESS,

21:14.314 --> 21:18.485
HIGHLIGHT LESS LOSER

21:18.527 --> 21:21.197
WANDERING AROUND TRYING

21:18.527 --> 21:21.197
TO MAKE SOMEONE CARE THEY EXIST.

21:21.239 --> 21:22.698
WHICH, NO ONE DOES.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.366
I CONTROL THE SENIOR CLASS.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.326
I AM ALSO THE LEADER

21:24.408 --> 21:26.326
OF THE PUFFS,

21:26.368 --> 21:29.205
THE MOST EXCLUSIVE SOCIETY

21:26.368 --> 21:29.205
ON THIS CAMPUS.

21:29.247 --> 21:32.541
I CAN MAKE HER LIFE

21:29.247 --> 21:32.541
A LIVING HELL.

21:29.247 --> 21:32.541
FRANCIE, SHE'S JUST --

21:32.583 --> 21:35.044
I CAN MAKE SURE

21:32.583 --> 21:35.044
SHE LEADS THE STUDENT BODY

21:35.086 --> 21:38.547
IN WHATEVER THE PLEDGE

21:35.086 --> 21:38.547
OF ALLEGIANCE HAPPENS TO BE

21:35.086 --> 21:38.547
CONSTITUTIONAL AT THE TIME.

21:38.589 --> 21:39.924
WHAT CAN I DO?

21:39.966 --> 21:42.718
I WANT YOU TO GO

21:39.966 --> 21:42.718
BACK TO MARGARET THATCHER

21:42.760 --> 21:44.637
AND TELL HER TO PLAY BALL.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.472
SHE'S GONNA SUPPORT

21:44.678 --> 21:46.472
THE HEMLINE ISSUE

21:46.513 --> 21:49.934
AND ANY OTHER ISSUE

21:46.513 --> 21:49.934
I BRING UP FOR

21:46.513 --> 21:49.934
THE REST OF THE YEAR.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.769
OTHERWISE, I'LL MAKE HER

21:49.976 --> 21:51.769
SO INEFFECTUAL,

21:51.811 --> 21:54.939
SHE'LL MAKE JIMMY CARTER

21:51.811 --> 21:54.939
LOOK LIKE MARTIN SHEEN.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.939
DO YOU GET ME?

21:54.981 --> 21:57.775
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

21:54.981 --> 21:57.775
REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS

21:54.981 --> 21:57.775
OF THE STUDENT BODY.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.944
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE

21:57.817 --> 21:59.944
BROKERING BACK-DOOR DEALS

21:59.986 --> 22:02.738
AND PUSHING THROUGH AGENDAS

21:59.986 --> 22:02.738
WITH INTIMIDATION AND BRIBERY.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.865
WHAT ARE WE,

22:02.780 --> 22:04.865
FRENCH SKATING JUDGES?

22:04.907 --> 22:06.867
WISE UP, GOLDILOCKS.

22:04.907 --> 22:06.867
MY HAIR'S BROWN.

22:06.909 --> 22:08.286
THIS IS POLITICS.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.746
IF YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM,

22:08.327 --> 22:10.746
TELL IT TO NOAM CHOMSKY.

22:10.788 --> 22:13.124
I LIVE IN THE REAL WORLD.

22:10.788 --> 22:13.124
NOW, BLOW.

22:13.166 --> 22:16.460
OH, AND I WOULD KEEP THIS

22:13.166 --> 22:16.460
CONVERSATION BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

22:16.502 --> 22:19.922
PARIS TENDS TO GET

22:16.502 --> 22:19.922
PARANOID WHEN THERE'S OTHER

22:16.502 --> 22:19.922
MAMMALS AT THE WATERING HOLE.

22:19.964 --> 22:22.633
SO HER FINDING OUT THAT

22:19.964 --> 22:22.633
YOU WERE CONFERRING WITH ME

22:22.675 --> 22:24.802
MIGHT NOT MAKE YOUR

22:22.675 --> 22:24.802
VICE-PRESIDENCY ANY EASIER.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.304
I AM NOT CONFERRING WITH YOU.

22:26.344 --> 22:28.264
A HAND CAME OUT

22:26.344 --> 22:28.264
AND PULLED ME IN.

22:28.306 --> 22:30.975
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

22:28.306 --> 22:30.975
YOU SOUGHT ME OUT

22:31.017 --> 22:33.351
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT PARIS

22:31.017 --> 22:33.351
WAS OUT OF LINE TODAY,

22:33.393 --> 22:34.854
AND YOU WANTED TO MAKE SURE

22:34.895 --> 22:36.689
MY VERY DELICATE FEELINGS

22:34.895 --> 22:36.689
WEREN'T HURT.

22:36.730 --> 22:38.732
YOU ARE SO SWEET

22:36.730 --> 22:38.732
TO THINK OF ME.

22:38.774 --> 22:41.027
I FEEL BETTER NOW THAT

22:38.774 --> 22:41.027
YOU'RE ON MY SIDE.

22:41.068 --> 22:42.820
BYE, SEE YOU

22:41.068 --> 22:42.820
AT THE HEMSTER.

22:45.072 --> 22:46.240
[ SIGHS ]

22:54.498 --> 22:56.959
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

22:54.498 --> 22:56.959
I CAME FOR THE WARMTH.

22:57.001 --> 22:58.752
YOU'RE NOT USUALLY HERE

22:57.001 --> 22:58.752
AT THIS TIME.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.129
I'M MEETING SOMEONE

22:58.794 --> 23:00.129
FOR LUNCH.

23:00.171 --> 23:01.547
OH. KIRK?

23:00.171 --> 23:01.547
WHAT?

23:01.588 --> 23:03.590
YOU MEETING KIRK?

23:01.588 --> 23:03.590
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

23:03.632 --> 23:06.969
I KNOW HE ASKED YOU OUT,

23:03.632 --> 23:06.969
SO I ASSUMED.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.969
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

23:07.011 --> 23:08.262
HE TOLD ME.

23:07.011 --> 23:08.262
HE DID?

23:08.304 --> 23:09.347
YESTERDAY.

23:08.304 --> 23:09.347
OH, MY GOD.

23:09.387 --> 23:10.973
RELAX.

23:09.387 --> 23:10.973
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

23:11.015 --> 23:12.225
WHY WOULD HE TELL YOU?

23:12.266 --> 23:15.269
HE CAME TO ME FOR ADVICE.

23:12.266 --> 23:15.269
ABOUT WHAT?

23:15.311 --> 23:17.104
WHETHER OR NOT

23:15.311 --> 23:17.104
HE HAD A SHOT.

23:17.146 --> 23:19.315
I KNOW YOU.

23:17.146 --> 23:19.315
I'VE BEEN TO YOUR HOUSE.

23:19.357 --> 23:21.775
I KNOW WHETHER OR NOT

23:19.357 --> 23:21.775
YOU HAVE STAIN-RESISTANT RUGS.

23:21.817 --> 23:25.196
WHEN HE FOUND OUT

23:21.817 --> 23:25.196
YOU HAD WOOD FLOORS,

23:21.817 --> 23:25.196
HE SEEMED VERY PLEASED.

23:25.238 --> 23:26.739
I TOLD HIM YOU LIKED MOVIES.

23:26.780 --> 23:29.700
AND, OF COURSE,

23:26.780 --> 23:29.700
TALKING INCESSANTLY,

23:26.780 --> 23:29.700
BUT WE BOTH AGREED

23:29.742 --> 23:32.953
THAT THERE'S NOTHING

23:29.742 --> 23:32.953
LIKE SOME GOOD LOVIN'

23:29.742 --> 23:32.953
TO SHUT A PERSON UP.

23:32.995 --> 23:34.747
CAN YOU BRING ME

23:32.995 --> 23:34.747
A SHARPER FORK?

23:34.788 --> 23:37.250
I'M NOT SURE THIS WILL

23:34.788 --> 23:37.250
GO THROUGH YOUR HAND.

23:37.291 --> 23:40.044
I KNOW IT'S NEW, YOU PROBABLY

23:37.291 --> 23:40.044
DON'T WANT TO JINX IT,

23:40.086 --> 23:43.130
I WON'T TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

23:40.086 --> 23:43.130
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

23:43.172 --> 23:46.300
SEEING THAT GUY'S FACE

23:43.172 --> 23:46.300
WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU,

23:46.342 --> 23:49.220
HE ALMOST HAD AN EXPRESSION.

23:46.342 --> 23:49.220
FAR, FAR AWAY FROM ME.

23:49.262 --> 23:51.513
♪ LOVE IS IN THE AIR ♪

23:51.555 --> 23:52.890
HA!

23:54.934 --> 23:57.144
WHY ARE YOU THROWING CUTLERY

23:54.934 --> 23:57.144
IN A PUBLIC PLACE?

23:57.186 --> 23:59.188
'CAUSE I FEEL STUPID

23:57.186 --> 23:59.188
DOING IT AT HOME.

23:59.230 --> 24:01.190
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

23:59.230 --> 24:01.190
THERE WAS TRAFFIC.

24:01.232 --> 24:04.484
IF I WAS IN TIME

24:01.232 --> 24:04.484
THERE WOULD STILL BE

24:01.232 --> 24:04.484
THE POSSIBILITY OF SOUP.

24:04.526 --> 24:08.072
I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE LONG.

24:04.526 --> 24:08.072
I STILL HAVE A KNIFE.

24:04.526 --> 24:08.072
GLAD TO HEAR IT.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.199
YOU GONNA SIT?

24:08.114 --> 24:10.199
YES, OF COURSE.

24:16.122 --> 24:19.541
THERE WE GO.

24:16.122 --> 24:19.541
WELL, THIS IS NICE.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.835
YOU CAN SEE THE WHOLE

24:19.583 --> 24:21.835
TOWN FROM HERE.

24:21.877 --> 24:24.338
YES. YOU CAN.

24:21.877 --> 24:24.338
I CAN SEE WHY YOU COME HERE.

24:24.380 --> 24:27.049
IT MUST BE FUN TO JUST SIT

24:24.380 --> 24:27.049
AND PEOPLE-WATCH.

24:27.091 --> 24:29.885
WELL, LET'S SEE WHAT

24:27.091 --> 24:29.885
THEY'VE GOT, SHALL WE?

24:31.387 --> 24:33.180
OH. CAESAR SALAD.

24:31.387 --> 24:33.180
IS THAT GOOD HERE?

24:33.222 --> 24:35.224
I'M SURE IT IS.

24:33.222 --> 24:35.224
YOU'VE NEVER HAD IT?

24:35.266 --> 24:36.767
HAS RORY?

24:35.266 --> 24:36.767
NO.

24:36.809 --> 24:39.812
OH. WELL, CAESAR SALAD

24:36.809 --> 24:39.812
CAN BE EXTREMELY UNSAFE

24:39.853 --> 24:41.814
IF THEY USE BAD EGGS.

24:39.853 --> 24:41.814
GET SOMETHING ELSE.

24:41.855 --> 24:44.400
OF COURSE, IF THEY'RE CODDLED,

24:41.855 --> 24:44.400
IT WOULD BE FINE.

24:44.442 --> 24:47.861
DO THEY CODDLE

24:44.442 --> 24:47.861
THE EGGS HERE?

24:44.442 --> 24:47.861
I HAVE NO IDEA.

24:47.903 --> 24:50.488
WHY DON'T YOU ASK LUKE?

24:47.903 --> 24:50.488
HE'LL JUST SAY THEY ARE.

24:50.530 --> 24:52.866
I'LL HAVE A COBB SALAD.

24:50.530 --> 24:52.866
WHAT WILL YOU HAVE?

24:52.908 --> 24:55.493
CAESAR SALAD WITH EXTRA

24:52.908 --> 24:55.493
UNCODDLED EGGS ON THE SIDE.

24:55.535 --> 24:58.372
WOULD A SERIOUS ANSWER ONCE

24:55.535 --> 24:58.372
IN A WHILE KILL YOU?

24:58.414 --> 25:00.791
I'M SORRY, MOM.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.791
HONESTLY, I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.209
ABOUT WHAT?

25:00.833 --> 25:02.209
ABOUT THIS.

25:02.251 --> 25:04.170
WHAT'S CONFUSING?

25:02.251 --> 25:04.170
WE'RE HAVING LUNCH.

25:04.211 --> 25:06.422
I KNOW WE'RE HAVING LUNCH,

25:04.211 --> 25:06.422
BUT WE USUALLY DON'T.

25:06.464 --> 25:09.008
ESPECIALLY NOT IN MY TOWN

25:06.464 --> 25:09.008
AT LUKE'S DINER.

25:09.049 --> 25:11.885
I FIGURED YOU HAD WORK,

25:09.049 --> 25:11.885
IT WOULD BE EASIER ON YOU.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.012
OKAY. THAT'S FINE.

25:13.053 --> 25:14.512
YOU TWO READY TO ORDER?

25:14.554 --> 25:17.350
YES. HOW IS YOUR CAESAR SALAD

25:14.554 --> 25:17.350
DRESSING PREPARED?

25:17.391 --> 25:21.061
I'LL HAVE TO CALL PAUL NEWMAN

25:17.391 --> 25:21.061
AND ASK HIM.

25:21.103 --> 25:23.063
A COBB SALAD

25:21.103 --> 25:23.063
AND AN ICED TEA.

25:23.105 --> 25:25.191
CHEESEBURGER, FRIES, ONION

25:23.105 --> 25:25.191
RINGS, AND A CHERRY COKE.

25:25.232 --> 25:27.401
ANY PIE TODAY?

25:25.232 --> 25:27.401
NO THANKS.

25:27.443 --> 25:31.280
CUTTING BACK A LITTLE. TRYING

25:27.443 --> 25:31.280
TO LOOK GOOD FOR THE BIG DAY.

25:27.443 --> 25:31.280
SMART. VERY SMART.

25:31.322 --> 25:33.949
MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THAT

25:31.322 --> 25:33.949
FRYING OIL WITH YOUR FACE.

25:35.909 --> 25:39.537
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

25:35.909 --> 25:39.537
NOTHING. JUST A LITTLE

25:35.909 --> 25:39.537
SMALL-TOWN CHARM.

25:39.579 --> 25:43.167
NOW, PLEASE, MOM, TELL ME,

25:39.579 --> 25:43.167
WHY DID YOU ASK ME TO LUNCH?

25:43.209 --> 25:45.878
BECAUSE I WANTED TO SPEND SOME

25:43.209 --> 25:45.878
TIME ALONE WITH MY DAUGHTER.

25:45.919 --> 25:48.797
MOM...

25:45.919 --> 25:48.797
RORY DROPS BY AFTER SCHOOL

25:45.919 --> 25:48.797
EVERY NOW AND THEN,

25:48.839 --> 25:50.299
SO WE SEE HER ALONE.

25:50.341 --> 25:52.218
MOM...

25:50.341 --> 25:52.218
BUT WE NEVER SEE YOU ALONE,

25:52.259 --> 25:55.179
UNLESS RORY LEAVES THE ROOM.

25:52.259 --> 25:55.179
EVEN THEN, YOU GO WITH HER.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.390
IF I HAD A NICKEL

25:55.221 --> 25:57.390
FOR WHEN YOU'VE USED

25:57.431 --> 25:59.557
"GIRLS ALWAYS GO TO THE

25:57.431 --> 25:59.557
BATHROOM TOGETHER" LINE,

25:59.599 --> 26:04.522
I'D BE A VERY RICH.

25:59.599 --> 26:04.522
YOU<i> ARE</i> A VERY RICH. IS THIS

25:59.599 --> 26:04.522
REALLY A ME-AND-YOU LUNCH?

26:04.562 --> 26:07.607
NO HIDDEN AGENDA?

26:04.562 --> 26:07.607
OF COURSE NOT.

26:07.649 --> 26:10.819
OKAY. FINE.

26:10.861 --> 26:11.987
I TALKED TO CHRISTOPHER.

26:12.029 --> 26:13.489
WHAT?

26:13.531 --> 26:16.283
I CALLED HIM LAST WEEK.

26:13.531 --> 26:16.283
WE TALKED FOR A LONG TIME.

26:16.325 --> 26:19.912
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, HE IS

26:16.325 --> 26:19.912
NOT IN LOVE WITH THAT WOMAN.

26:19.953 --> 26:23.790
HE NEVER SAID IT, I COULD TELL

26:19.953 --> 26:23.790
FROM HIS VOICE, HE'D RATHER

26:19.953 --> 26:23.790
BE WITH YOU.

26:23.832 --> 26:26.252
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

26:23.832 --> 26:26.252
YOU NEED TO TALK.

26:26.293 --> 26:30.464
THAT WOULD BE A YES.

26:26.293 --> 26:30.464
ALL HE NEEDS IS TO HEAR

26:26.293 --> 26:30.464
IS THAT YOU WANT THIS.

26:30.506 --> 26:32.758
MOM, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU

26:30.506 --> 26:32.758
DOING CALLING CHRISTOPHER?

26:32.799 --> 26:33.967
WELL, SOMEBODY HAD TO.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.220
NO.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.220
SOMEBODY DIDN'T HAVE TO.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.055
I WASN'T

26:36.262 --> 26:38.055
GOING TO JUST SIT BY

26:38.097 --> 26:40.015
AND WATCH THIS SITUATION

26:38.097 --> 26:40.015
EXPLODE.

26:40.057 --> 26:43.185
YOU TWO BELONG TOGETHER.

26:40.057 --> 26:43.185
IT TOOK YOU YEARS

26:40.057 --> 26:43.185
TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

26:43.227 --> 26:45.771
NOW THAT YOU HAVE IT,

26:43.227 --> 26:45.771
YOU CAN'T LET IT GO.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.231
JUST BECAUSE OF A LITTLE

26:45.812 --> 26:47.231
COMPLICATION.

26:47.273 --> 26:49.316
MOM, HIS GIRLFRIEND

26:47.273 --> 26:49.316
IS PREGNANT.

26:49.358 --> 26:51.110
THAT IS MORE THAN

26:49.358 --> 26:51.110
A LITTLE COMPLICATION.

26:51.151 --> 26:53.653
WOMEN HAVE GOTTEN PREGNANT

26:51.151 --> 26:53.653
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME.

26:53.695 --> 26:55.948
BEFORE I RESORT TO THE

26:53.695 --> 26:55.948
TOTALLY CALLED FOR "DUH,"

26:55.989 --> 26:57.324
PLEASE TELL ME

26:55.989 --> 26:57.324
YOUR POINT.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.159
THIS WOMAN IS TRYING

26:57.366 --> 26:59.159
TO TRAP HIM.

26:59.201 --> 27:00.953
YOU CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

27:00.994 --> 27:03.372
MOM, THIS IS NONE

27:00.994 --> 27:03.372
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

27:03.414 --> 27:05.958
YES, IT IS. IT AFFECTS RORY.

27:03.414 --> 27:05.958
IT AFFECTS YOU.

27:05.999 --> 27:10.379
BOTH OF WHOM ARE MY BUSINESS.

27:05.999 --> 27:10.379
DO NOT GET INVOLVED IN THIS.

27:05.999 --> 27:10.379
I MEAN IT. BUTT OUT.

27:10.421 --> 27:13.382
DON'T CALL CHRISTOPHER

27:10.421 --> 27:13.382
AND TALK ABOUT ME OR US.

27:13.424 --> 27:14.883
JUST STAY OUT OF IT.

27:14.925 --> 27:18.220
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

27:14.925 --> 27:18.220
DO NOT WALK OUT ON ME.

27:18.262 --> 27:20.389
I AM NOT GONNA DISCUSS THIS.

27:20.431 --> 27:24.435
I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO RESPECT

27:20.431 --> 27:24.435
THAT, BUT I KNOW YOU,

27:20.431 --> 27:24.435
SO GIVE CHRISTOPHER MY LOVE.

27:24.477 --> 27:26.604
A FAMILY LIFE DOESN'T JUST

27:24.477 --> 27:26.604
HAPPEN, LORELAI.

27:26.644 --> 27:29.482
YOU HAVE TO WORK

27:26.644 --> 27:29.482
AND FIGHT FOR IT.

27:29.523 --> 27:32.276
LORELAI, COME BACK HERE.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.778
WHEN SHE'S OUT

27:32.318 --> 27:34.778
OF INTENSIVE CARE,

27:32.318 --> 27:34.778
WE'LL GET HER SIGNATURE,

27:34.820 --> 27:37.531
AND THEN WE CAN FINALLY SET

27:34.820 --> 27:37.531
ABOUT HIRING A NEW LIBRARIAN.

27:37.573 --> 27:40.700
ANYTHING ELSE?

27:37.573 --> 27:40.700
YES. I WAS THINKING

27:37.573 --> 27:40.700
THAT MAYBE THIS YEAR,

27:40.742 --> 27:43.078
WE COULD THROW A BEGINNING-

27:40.742 --> 27:43.078
OF-THE-SCHOOL-YEAR DANCE.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.080
WHY WAIT UNTIL

27:43.120 --> 27:45.080
THE TAN FADES?

27:45.122 --> 27:47.583
DANCES ARE DISTRACTING.

27:45.122 --> 27:47.583
DANCES HELP BRING IN MONEY

27:47.625 --> 27:50.085
TO PAY FOR THOSE STUPID

27:47.625 --> 27:50.085
TOPIARIES YOU WANT.

27:50.127 --> 27:52.879
DRAFT A PROPOSAL AND HAVE IT

27:50.127 --> 27:52.879
ON MY DESK BY TOMORROW.

27:52.921 --> 27:57.301
I'D LIKE TO EXPLORE THE OPTION

27:52.921 --> 27:57.301
OF HAVING A PROFESSIONAL

27:52.921 --> 27:57.301
PHOTOGRAPHER.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.470
EVERY YEAR, WE USE

27:57.343 --> 27:59.470
THAT CHEESY PICTURE PLACE,

27:59.512 --> 28:03.349
AND EVERY YEAR, PEOPLE WIND UP

27:59.512 --> 28:03.349
WITH THOSE VH1 "BEFORE THEY

27:59.512 --> 28:03.349
WERE STARS" PICTURES.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.725
I WOULD LIKE TO STOP

28:03.390 --> 28:05.725
THE HUMILIATION NOW.

28:05.767 --> 28:07.520
HOW ARE WE GOING

28:05.767 --> 28:07.520
TO GET ONE?

28:07.561 --> 28:08.854
HELMUT NEWTON

28:07.561 --> 28:08.854
IS MY GODFATHER.

28:08.895 --> 28:10.314
SIGN HIM UP.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.858
TELL HIM TO LEAVE THE WHIPS

28:10.356 --> 28:12.858
AND CHAINS AT HOME.

28:12.899 --> 28:15.027
THAT'S ALL

28:12.899 --> 28:15.027
WE HAVE TIME FOR TODAY.

28:15.068 --> 28:16.862
EXCUSE ME, PARIS.

28:16.903 --> 28:19.239
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU

28:16.903 --> 28:19.239
THOUGHT ABOUT MY PROPOSAL.

28:19.281 --> 28:20.032
WHAT PROPOSAL?

28:20.073 --> 28:21.741
THE HIGHER HEMLINES.

28:21.783 --> 28:24.036
OH, RIGHT.

28:21.783 --> 28:24.036
NO, NOT YET.

28:24.077 --> 28:27.122
OKAY. I GUESS I CAN WAIT...

28:24.077 --> 28:27.122
FOR A WHILE.

28:27.164 --> 28:30.083
PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE.

28:27.164 --> 28:30.083
MEETING ADJOURNED.

28:35.339 --> 28:36.840
HEY.

28:35.339 --> 28:36.840
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT

28:36.882 --> 28:38.467
HELMUT NEWTON

28:36.882 --> 28:38.467
BEING LOUISE'S GODFATHER?

28:38.509 --> 28:39.843
EXPLAINS A LOT.

28:39.885 --> 28:42.137
LISTEN, I THINK

28:39.885 --> 28:42.137
IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA

28:42.179 --> 28:44.014
TO CONSIDER GETTING BEHIND

28:42.179 --> 28:44.014
THIS HEMLINE ISSUE.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.765
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

28:45.807 --> 28:47.685
IF GIRLS WANT TO MAKE

28:45.807 --> 28:47.685
THEIR SKIRTS SHORTER,

28:47.726 --> 28:51.522
THEN WHO CARES, RIGHT?

28:47.726 --> 28:51.522
I CARE.

28:47.726 --> 28:51.522
I'M BUILDING A LEGACY HERE.

28:51.564 --> 28:53.482
YOU WANT THE FIRST

28:51.564 --> 28:53.482
STAND I MAKE

28:53.524 --> 28:54.692
TO INVOLVE A FASHION CHOICE?

28:54.733 --> 28:56.818
IT WOULD BE MY GAYS

28:54.733 --> 28:56.818
IN THE MILITARY.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.196
I JUST THINK WE SHOULD

28:56.860 --> 28:59.196
ESTABLISH SOME GOODWILL

28:59.238 --> 29:00.573
AMONG THE OTHER

28:59.238 --> 29:00.573
CLASS PRESIDENTS.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.741
WHY?

29:00.614 --> 29:02.741
BECAUSE YOU HAVE

29:00.614 --> 29:02.741
TO WORK WITH THEM,

29:02.782 --> 29:05.536
AND YOU MIGHT NEED THEIR SUPPORT

29:02.782 --> 29:05.536
ON SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE.

29:05.578 --> 29:08.581
THROWING THEM A BONE

29:05.578 --> 29:08.581
LIKE A HEMLINE AMENDMENT

29:05.578 --> 29:08.581
IS NO BIG DEAL.

29:08.622 --> 29:11.500
I DON'T KNOW.

29:08.622 --> 29:11.500
IT'S RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING

29:08.622 --> 29:11.500
OF YOUR TERM.

29:11.542 --> 29:14.461
NO ONE WILL EVEN REMEMBER

29:11.542 --> 29:14.461
THE FIRST STUPID THING

29:11.542 --> 29:14.461
YOU PASSED.

29:14.503 --> 29:17.047
YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME

29:14.503 --> 29:17.047
TO ESTABLISH YOUR LEGACY.

29:17.089 --> 29:20.050
BY THE TIME THAT YOU

29:17.089 --> 29:20.050
IMPLEMENT PUBLIC EXECUTIONS

29:17.089 --> 29:20.050
FOR LINE CUTTERS,

29:20.092 --> 29:23.721
HEMLINES WILL BE

29:20.092 --> 29:23.721
A THING OF THE PAST.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.805
I WAS MAKING A JOKE,

29:23.762 --> 29:25.805
NOT A SUGGESTION.

29:25.847 --> 29:28.058
WHY DO YOU CARE?

29:25.847 --> 29:28.058
WHAT?

29:28.100 --> 29:31.853
WHY DO YOU CARE?

29:28.100 --> 29:31.853
YOU SEEM VERY INVESTED

29:28.100 --> 29:31.853
IN THIS WHOLE THING. WHY?

29:31.895 --> 29:33.772
I'M NOT INVESTED.

29:33.813 --> 29:37.401
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT,

29:33.813 --> 29:37.401
FINE. I'M JUST GIVING YOU

29:33.813 --> 29:37.401
MY OPINION.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.778
I JUST THOUGHT YOU'D WANT

29:37.443 --> 29:39.778
TO A PRESIDENT

29:39.819 --> 29:43.282
WHO'S BELOVED

29:39.819 --> 29:43.282
AS WELL AS RESPECTED.

29:43.323 --> 29:45.659
RAISING HEMLINES

29:43.323 --> 29:45.659
WOULD MAKE ME BELOVED?

29:45.701 --> 29:48.120
IT'S CERTAINLY A STEP

29:45.701 --> 29:48.120
IN THAT DIRECTION.

29:48.161 --> 29:50.205
ALL RIGHT.

29:48.161 --> 29:50.205
I'LL PUSH IT THROUGH.

29:48.161 --> 29:50.205
GOOD.

29:50.247 --> 29:52.207
BUT THE NEXT GENIUS

29:50.247 --> 29:52.207
WHO WANTS

29:52.249 --> 29:55.835
TO PUT AN ELIZABETH ARDEN

29:52.249 --> 29:55.835
IN THE CHEMISTRY CLASS

29:52.249 --> 29:55.835

YOU ARE GOING.

THE DETAILS HEAPED

30:08.599 --> 30:11.059
IN THE PAST.

30:11.101 --> 30:12.645
I CAN'T BELIEVE

30:11.101 --> 30:12.645
SHE CALLED CHRISTOPHER.

30:12.686 --> 30:15.105
SHE HAS NO RESPECT FOR MY

30:12.686 --> 30:15.105
PRIVACY OR MY FEELINGS

30:15.147 --> 30:17.399
SHE THOUGHT

30:15.147 --> 30:17.399
SHE WAS HELPING.

30:17.441 --> 30:19.359
YOU KNOW THERE ISN'T

30:17.441 --> 30:19.359

30:19.401 --> 30:21.194
PLEASE JUST TRY

30:19.401 --> 30:21.194
TO FORGET THIS.

30:21.236 --> 30:22.696
I'M NEVER GOING

30:21.236 --> 30:22.696
THERE AGAIN.

30:22.738 --> 30:25.031
NOT AN OPTION.

30:22.738 --> 30:25.031
SHOULD BE.

30:25.073 --> 30:28.160
SHE'S YOUR MOTHER.

30:25.073 --> 30:28.160
I WANT PROOF.

30:25.073 --> 30:28.160
I WANT TESTS DONE.

30:28.201 --> 30:29.911

30:29.953 --> 30:31.664

30:29.953 --> 30:31.664
WHO ELSE SHE'S CALLING.

30:31.705 --> 30:33.666

30:39.713 --> 30:41.381
DON'T GET THAT.

30:39.713 --> 30:41.381
IT MIGHT BE HER.

30:41.423 --> 30:44.217
I DOUBT SHE'D CALL WHEN

30:41.423 --> 30:44.217
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THERE.

30:44.259 --> 30:47.763
Kirk: Hello? Hello?

30:49.640 --> 30:51.600
THE ANSWERING MACHINE

30:49.640 --> 30:51.600
CONFUSED HIM.

30:51.642 --> 30:53.727
AND THAT'S THE GUY

30:51.642 --> 30:53.727
WHO LIKES ME.

30:53.769 --> 30:56.021

INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES

30:59.483 --> 31:02.110
AND SAY, "I WISH I WERE YOU"

30:59.483 --> 31:02.110
AT THE SAME TIME.

31:02.152 --> 31:03.487
WE'LL PULL

31:02.152 --> 31:03.487
A "FREAKY FRIDAY."

31:03.529 --> 31:05.197
OR WE CAN JUST PRETEND.

31:05.238 --> 31:08.283

31:10.035 --> 31:12.037

31:12.078 --> 31:16.208
WITH YOU ANYTIME.

31:12.078 --> 31:16.208
I KNOW, AND I APPRECIATE THAT.

31:16.249 --> 31:19.252
Lorelai, I think there might

31:16.249 --> 31:19.252
be a problem with your phone.

31:19.294 --> 31:21.380

41:27.277 --> 41:29.654
YOU WROTE TO ME?

41:29.695 --> 41:31.990

41:29.695 --> 41:31.990
NOT TO SAY ANYTHING --
