00:34.967 --> 00:37.333
Ball one to Johnny Damon
and we are under way.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.402
Damon has eight hits
in 18 at bats...

00:39.605 --> 00:42.073
...a double, a triple,
a couple of stolen bases.

00:42.275 --> 00:44.368
He had four hits
in the series opener.

00:45.711 --> 00:47.269
Strike.

00:59.125 --> 01:01.855
Down the right-field line,
fair off the bat of Damon.

01:02.061 --> 01:04.962
It rolls by Spencer.

01:05.164 --> 01:08.258
And Damon will coast into
second base with a leadoff double.

01:13.673 --> 01:17.040
Into right-center field,
broken bat, it'll fall, a base hit.

01:17.243 --> 01:19.177
They wave around Damon.
He will score.

01:19.378 --> 01:21.642
And Jason Giambi delivers...

01:21.847 --> 01:24.748
...with a run-scoring single
here in the opening inning.

01:24.951 --> 01:27.442
And the Athletics
have taken that 1-nothing lead.

01:27.653 --> 01:29.553
Go, come on, now. We gotta spin it.

01:39.165 --> 01:42.134
Let's go, Yankees!
Let's go, Yankees!

01:44.370 --> 01:47.100
Let's go, Yankees!

01:47.306 --> 01:48.295
Bases loaded.

01:48.507 --> 01:52.637
The Yankees have the tying run
at second, down 2-nothing.

01:57.817 --> 02:00.945
The A's are kicking it and throwing it
all over the field.

02:01.153 --> 02:05.180
And it might lead to their elimination
if they don't get it right in a hurry.

02:05.391 --> 02:09.020
Hammered down the right-field line.
Justice!

02:09.996 --> 02:11.896
The Yankees have taken the lead.

02:17.837 --> 02:20.499
They're standing,
anticipating another trip...

02:20.706 --> 02:23.869
...to the League
Championship Series.

02:24.076 --> 02:26.306
The Yankees one out away.

02:27.847 --> 02:32.375
Eric Byrnes, never with an at bat
in Yankee Stadium...

02:32.585 --> 02:35.213
...and they don't get much bigger
than this one.

02:35.421 --> 02:38.948
Or more hectic when you're up there
trying to get a job done.

03:01.113 --> 03:03.604
And they're a strike away.

03:04.417 --> 03:07.409
And they're roaring in the Bronx.

03:09.255 --> 03:13.658
Losing the first two games at home
in the best-of-five series...

03:13.859 --> 03:16.828
...and roar back to...

03:34.647 --> 03:38.174
The Yankees will defend their title.

03:56.102 --> 03:58.502
It's okay, Joe, you can leave it on.

03:58.704 --> 04:01.400
- I don't need to watch.
- Joe, leave it on.

04:01.607 --> 04:02.596
Okay.

04:12.017 --> 04:14.781
Imagine how bad it'd be
if you were a Yankee player...

04:14.987 --> 04:17.285
...and didn't like the taste
of champagne.

04:18.724 --> 04:20.021
Better ask to get traded.

04:20.226 --> 04:23.593
You gotta give the Yankees...

04:23.796 --> 04:25.388
win the big game.

04:25.598 --> 04:29.364
What a series that is gonna be
in the next...

04:37.076 --> 04:39.442
You know how many kids
are wearing Giambi's...?

04:39.645 --> 04:43.206
You know, Oakland Giambi's jerseys
and hats and pictures and posters?

04:43.415 --> 04:46.851
Those same kids will be booing
in July when the Yankees come here.

04:47.052 --> 04:51.250
Is it Giambi that's stabbing the back
or the Pinstripes on the East Coast?

04:51.457 --> 04:53.948
You can't blame them
for pilfering the henhouse.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.390
- The henhouse is there.
- I can't blame them?

04:56.595 --> 04:59.860
They're offering $ 120 million
over six years.

05:00.065 --> 05:03.694
The Yankees have deeper pockets
and they're willing to give him money.

05:03.903 --> 05:05.461
They're pilfering our players.

05:05.671 --> 05:09.038
It's like we're a farm system
for the New York Yankees.

05:14.847 --> 05:17.315
- How are the guys doing?
- That was a killer.

05:17.516 --> 05:20.451
That was a killer.
It's a tough one to swallow. It's...

05:20.653 --> 05:23.213
- They played great.
- They played their hearts out.

05:23.422 --> 05:26.619
They did. They played fantastic.
It just didn't fall our way.

05:26.826 --> 05:29.727
- You'll do better next year.
- But we were close, though.

05:29.929 --> 05:31.920
- We were so close.
- Right there.

05:32.131 --> 05:34.497
Almost had it.
You gotta feel good about that.

05:34.700 --> 05:37.897
I feel great about it.
I feel great about it.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.939
We're not gonna do better next year.

05:45.144 --> 05:48.011
- Why not?
- Well, you know we're being gutted.

05:48.214 --> 05:53.151
We're losing Giambi,
Damon, Isringhausen.

05:53.352 --> 05:55.912
Done deal. We're in trouble.

05:56.121 --> 05:59.352
You'll find new guys.
You found Jason, you found Damon.

05:59.558 --> 06:01.651
- I need more money, Steve.
- Billy.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.988
- I need more money.
- We don't have any.

06:04.196 --> 06:06.756
I can't compete against $ 120 million
with $38 million.

06:06.966 --> 06:10.231
We're not gonna compete with
these teams that have big budgets.

06:10.436 --> 06:13.064
We're gonna work
within the constraints we have...

06:13.272 --> 06:17.003
...and you're gonna do the best job
that you can recruiting new players.

06:17.209 --> 06:19.439
We're not gonna pay $ 17 million
to players.

06:19.645 --> 06:21.806
I'm not asking you...

06:22.882 --> 06:24.747
...for 10 or 20, 30 million dollars.

06:24.950 --> 06:26.713
I'm just asking for a bit of help.

06:26.919 --> 06:30.548
Get me a little closer and I will get you
that championship team.

06:30.756 --> 06:34.988
I mean, this is why I'm here.
This is why you hired me.

06:35.194 --> 06:38.994
And I gotta ask you,
what are we doing here...

06:39.198 --> 06:41.758
- Billy, l...
...if it's not to win a championship?

06:41.967 --> 06:45.368
- I wanna win just as much...
- That's my bar. My bar is here.

06:45.971 --> 06:48.439
My bar is to take this team
to the championship.

06:48.641 --> 06:53.408
Billy, we're a small-market team,
and you're a small-market GM.

06:53.612 --> 06:58.447
I'm asking you to be okay
not spending money that I don't have.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.113
And I'm asking you
to take a deep breath...

07:01.320 --> 07:04.812
...shake off the loss,
get back in a room with your guys...

07:05.024 --> 07:08.516
...and figure out how to find
replacements for the guys we lost...

07:08.727 --> 07:10.592
...with the money that we do have.

07:10.796 --> 07:16.098
I'm not leaving here. I'm not...
I can't leave here with that.

07:17.036 --> 07:19.300
What else can I help you with?

07:30.449 --> 07:32.883
It's a good offer,
and you gotta match it. L...

07:33.085 --> 07:34.712
I need another day.

07:34.920 --> 07:38.151
His mind's pretty made up.
I just think you should know that.

07:39.058 --> 07:42.118
- I got a call. I'll get you back.
- I'll let him know.

07:42.328 --> 07:43.955
Bye.

07:45.097 --> 07:46.894
- Yeah?
- Billy, Scott.

07:47.099 --> 07:49.465
- Just got off the phone with Dan.
- You didn't.

07:49.668 --> 07:51.192
I was surprised he called me.

07:51.403 --> 07:54.497
Stop. I got Johnny for 7.5
or he doesn't play anywhere else.

07:54.707 --> 07:59.474
- That's the deal you made.
- Boston just upped it to 7. 75.

08:01.380 --> 08:02.870
You there?

08:04.383 --> 08:08.444
- We had a deal, Scott.
- We have a deal, if it's 8 million.

08:08.654 --> 08:11.851
- Oh, man, you played me.
- I'm just doing my job for my client.

08:12.057 --> 08:14.685
No, you're playing me,
and you're still playing me.

08:14.893 --> 08:17.453
Congratulations, asshole. You win.

08:25.037 --> 08:27.505
I like guys that got a little hair
on their ass.

08:27.706 --> 08:30.470
He looks like a Mantle or a Mays,
quite frankly.

08:30.676 --> 08:33.405
- He's got a baseball body.
- Matty, who do you got?

08:33.611 --> 08:35.546
- I like Geronimo.
- Yes.

08:35.748 --> 08:39.115
The guy's an athlete.
Big, fast, talented.

08:39.318 --> 08:41.342
- Top of my list.
- Clean-cut, good face.

08:41.553 --> 08:43.214
- Yeah, good jaw.
- Five-tools guy.

08:43.422 --> 08:45.356
- Good-looking ballplayer.
- Can he hit?

08:45.557 --> 08:48.651
- He's got a beautiful swing.
- The ball explodes off his bat.

08:48.861 --> 08:51.955
He throws the club head at the ball,
and when he connects...

08:52.164 --> 08:54.359
...he drives it, it pops off the bat.

08:54.566 --> 08:57.831
- You can hear it all over the ballpark.
- A lot of pop.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.062
If he's good,
why doesn't he hit good?

09:00.272 --> 09:02.206
- He is a good hitter.
- He'll be ready.

09:02.408 --> 09:05.070
He's gonna be a good hitter
against big-league arms?

09:05.277 --> 09:07.040
- Could be great.
- I don't think so.

09:07.246 --> 09:10.511
Kid needs at bats. Give him
400 at bats, he's gonna get better.

09:10.716 --> 09:13.617
- He can play.
- He's hit everywhere along the line.

09:13.819 --> 09:15.514
He's one of our guys.

09:21.827 --> 09:23.351
Okay, let's move on.

09:23.562 --> 09:27.965
- Artie, who do you like?
- I like Perez. He's got a classic swing.

09:28.167 --> 09:31.603
- It's a real clean stroke.
- I don't know. Can't hit the curveball.

09:31.804 --> 09:35.262
There's some work to be done,
I'll admit that, but he's noticeable.

09:35.474 --> 09:37.738
- Got an ugly girlfriend.
- What's that mean?

09:37.943 --> 09:39.968
Ugly girlfriend
means no confidence.

09:40.179 --> 09:43.444
You are full of it. Artie is right.
This guy's got an attitude.

09:43.649 --> 09:44.877
An attitude is good.

09:45.084 --> 09:48.520
He walks in a room, his dick's already
been there for two minutes.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.950
He passes the eye-candy test.
Got the looks.

09:51.156 --> 09:54.057
He's ready to play the part.
He just needs playing time.

09:54.259 --> 09:56.750
I'm just saying,
his girlfriend is a six at best.

09:56.962 --> 10:00.159
Look, if we're trying to replace Giambi,
this guy could be it.

10:00.365 --> 10:01.992
I agree with you.

10:04.603 --> 10:07.128
Damn, Billy, was that a suggestion?

10:07.840 --> 10:10.070
Guys, you're just talking.

10:10.275 --> 10:14.143
Talking... like this is business
as usual.

10:14.346 --> 10:15.779
It's not.

10:16.615 --> 10:18.378
We're trying to solve the problem.

10:18.584 --> 10:21.075
Not like this.
You're not looking at the problem.

10:21.286 --> 10:23.379
We're very aware of the problem.
I mean...

10:23.589 --> 10:26.057
Okay, good. What's the problem?

10:30.195 --> 10:34.029
Look, Billy,
we all understand what the problem is.

10:34.233 --> 10:36.599
- We have to...
- Okay, good. What's the problem?

10:36.802 --> 10:39.532
We have to replace three key players
in our lineup.

10:39.738 --> 10:41.205
Nope. What's the problem?

10:41.406 --> 10:43.931
We gotta replace these guys
with what we have...

10:44.143 --> 10:45.804
No. What's the problem, Barry?

10:46.011 --> 10:50.607
We need 38 home runs, 120 RBIs
and 47 doubles to replace.

10:50.816 --> 10:54.343
The problem we're trying to solve
is that there are rich teams...

10:54.553 --> 10:58.353
...and there are poor teams,
then there's 50 feet of crap...

10:58.557 --> 11:00.718
...and then there's us.

11:01.527 --> 11:04.018
It's an unfair game.

11:07.099 --> 11:11.001
And now we've been gutted.
We're like organ donors for the rich.

11:11.203 --> 11:14.229
Boston's taken our kidneys,
Yankees have taken our heart.

11:14.439 --> 11:15.770
And you guys sit around...

11:15.974 --> 11:20.968
...talking the same old "good body"
nonsense like we're selling jeans.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.375
Like we're looking for Fabio.

11:23.582 --> 11:25.641
We got to think differently.

11:26.285 --> 11:29.311
We are the last dog at the bowl.

11:29.521 --> 11:32.490
You see what happens to the runt
of the litter? He dies.

11:33.525 --> 11:36.255
Billy, that's a very touching story
and everything...

11:36.461 --> 11:39.828
...but I think we're all very much aware
of what we're facing.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.933
You have a lot of experience
and wisdom in this room.

11:43.135 --> 11:47.231
You need to have a little faith and
let us do the job of replacing Giambi.

11:47.673 --> 11:49.868
Is there another first baseman
like Giambi?

11:50.075 --> 11:51.099
- No, not really.
- No.

11:51.310 --> 11:54.108
- Lf there was, could we afford him?
- Nope.

11:54.313 --> 11:57.771
Then what the fuck
are you talking about, man?

11:58.483 --> 12:01.577
If we try to play like the Yankees
in here...

12:02.120 --> 12:04.588
...we will lose to the Yankees
out there.

12:05.791 --> 12:08.726
Boy, that sounds like
fortune-cookie wisdom to me, Billy.

12:09.328 --> 12:12.422
- No, that's just logic.
- Who's Fabio?

12:12.631 --> 12:15.293
He's a shortstop.
He's a shortstop from Seattle.

12:15.500 --> 12:18.060
Now, this is no time
to push the panic button.

12:18.270 --> 12:21.728
Our scouts will find players,
Player Development will develop them.

12:21.940 --> 12:24.306
We'll teach them
to play Oakland A baseball.

12:24.509 --> 12:27.410
With all due respect,
we've been doing this a long time.

12:27.613 --> 12:30.912
Why don't you just let us
be responsible for replacing Giambi...

12:31.116 --> 12:33.676
...with who we know that can play?

12:47.933 --> 12:51.198
- Easy power.
- And loose.

12:51.403 --> 12:52.893
Good face.

13:03.582 --> 13:06.608
This son of a bitch
is going in the first round.

13:07.452 --> 13:09.044
You're a premium player, Billy.

13:09.254 --> 13:12.189
You can run, you can field,
you can throw, you can hit...

13:12.391 --> 13:13.949
...you can hit with power.

13:14.159 --> 13:15.990
That doesn't come along very often.

13:16.194 --> 13:18.526
This is Tom Martinez,
national cross-checker.

13:18.730 --> 13:21.130
- How you doing? Nice to meet you.
- Billy Beane.

13:21.333 --> 13:25.463
It's been a while since I've seen
a five-tool guy that can do everything.

13:25.971 --> 13:28.701
I'm hopeful your interest
in professional baseball...

13:28.907 --> 13:33.037
...is as strong as ours is gonna be
in getting you in this upcoming draft.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.744
Mr. Beane?

13:42.721 --> 13:44.518
Mark is ready to see you now.

13:51.363 --> 13:52.660
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

13:52.864 --> 13:53.853
- How are you?
- Good.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.632
- Hey, Billy.
- Hey, Mark.

13:57.836 --> 14:00.634
- Good to see you. Please sit down.
- You too.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.705
- These are the guys. Guys, Billy.
- Boys.

14:05.277 --> 14:07.404
- How's it going?
- All right. How you been?

14:07.612 --> 14:11.480
- You're filling out that chair nicely.
- I got three weeks in it right now.

14:11.683 --> 14:12.672
Good, good, man.

14:12.884 --> 14:15.352
- Yeah, man. How you doing?
- Fantastic.

14:15.554 --> 14:17.112
- Awesome.
- Couldn't be better.

14:17.322 --> 14:19.984
That's good to hear.
I'm not gonna waste your time.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.285
You just tell me
what you're looking for.

14:22.494 --> 14:24.758
Fifty million dollars
in additional payroll.

14:24.963 --> 14:26.362
You should try Giambi.

14:27.332 --> 14:30.699
I'm sorry. Too soon, right?
I want this to be a friendly meeting.

14:30.902 --> 14:32.494
It's not all on your shoulders.

14:32.704 --> 14:34.695
- Where's Steve in this?
- Steve's great.

14:34.906 --> 14:36.931
He's supportive
in rebuilding this team.

14:37.142 --> 14:38.609
That's what we're gonna do.

14:38.810 --> 14:41.745
- So, what are you looking for?
- A left-handed reliever.

14:42.314 --> 14:44.782
I'm thinking Ricardo Rincon.

14:45.584 --> 14:47.074
That's not gonna happen.

14:48.687 --> 14:50.382
Not even a discussion?

14:50.589 --> 14:55.549
Billy, even if you could afford him,
respectfully, we love him.

14:55.761 --> 14:57.695
We're not about to let him go.

14:57.929 --> 14:59.863
You got this Venezuelan kid
coming up.

15:00.065 --> 15:02.363
We had him.
We moved him to Detroit.

15:03.735 --> 15:05.134
What else you thinking?

15:06.338 --> 15:07.862
Outfielders.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.735
- To replace Damon?
- Yeah.

15:10.942 --> 15:15.572
- In your price range? No disrespect.
- Enough, Mark.

15:16.681 --> 15:18.308
Hollins?

15:20.385 --> 15:22.910
- García?
- No.

15:23.121 --> 15:24.816
Maybe Coste.

15:27.793 --> 15:29.317
That's it.

15:30.695 --> 15:33.960
- All right, tell me about García.
- To replace Johnny Damon?

15:34.666 --> 15:37.635
- Mark, is he healthy?
- Yeah, he's healthy-ish.

15:37.836 --> 15:40.270
He had that back thing.

15:40.472 --> 15:43.202
- He'll be ready for spring ball.
- I'll tell you what.

15:43.408 --> 15:45.876
I can give you Guthrie
if you kick in some cash.

15:46.077 --> 15:47.101
- Mark Guthrie?
- Yeah.

15:47.312 --> 15:49.405
- How much cash?
- Two hundred K.

16:05.797 --> 16:07.162
Okay.

16:08.200 --> 16:12.000
- So García's gonna be a no.
- You're kidding me, right?

16:12.971 --> 16:15.269
- You're kidding me.
- I'm not.

16:16.975 --> 16:20.206
Okay. Straight up, García for Guthrie,
no kicker.

16:21.279 --> 16:23.873
- No kicker?
- Straight up.

16:27.252 --> 16:31.814
I think it's gonna be a hard no
on García, but let's just keep going.

16:32.023 --> 16:35.220
- What else you thinking?
- What are we doing? Is this business?

16:35.427 --> 16:37.657
This is the way we do business
in Cleveland.

17:21.506 --> 17:22.871
Hey.

17:24.108 --> 17:26.599
- Hello.
- Who are you?

17:29.481 --> 17:31.415
I'm Peter Brand.

17:32.350 --> 17:34.045
What do you do?

17:35.487 --> 17:38.012
I'm special assistant
to Mark Shapiro.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.054
So, what do you do?

17:42.460 --> 17:45.896
Mostly player analysis right now.

17:46.097 --> 17:49.794
Been on the job long?
First job in baseball?

17:51.269 --> 17:53.635
It's my first job anywhere.

17:53.838 --> 17:56.238
- Wow, congrats.
- Thank you.

17:56.441 --> 17:59.035
First job. Whose nephew are you?

18:01.479 --> 18:03.276
Why does Mark listen to you?

18:05.951 --> 18:07.748
I don't think...

18:08.486 --> 18:10.818
I don't think he does very often.

18:12.290 --> 18:14.155
He just did.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.751
Well, in that circumstance...

18:17.963 --> 18:21.490
...I think he was more listening
to Bruce than myself.

18:22.901 --> 18:24.493
Who are you?

18:27.238 --> 18:29.433
I'm Peter Brand.

18:32.477 --> 18:35.503
I don't give a rat's ass
what your name is.

18:36.247 --> 18:38.374
What happened in there?

18:39.517 --> 18:41.781
What happened in that room?

18:42.253 --> 18:44.915
I'm not quite sure
what you're asking me, Mr. Beane.

18:45.123 --> 18:47.523
What did you tell Bruce?

18:48.693 --> 18:53.187
- I just told Bruce I like García.
- You like García. Why?

18:55.500 --> 18:57.161
Why?

19:02.273 --> 19:03.763
I don't know.

19:21.393 --> 19:24.260
There is an epidemic failure
within the game...

19:24.462 --> 19:27.022
...to understand
what is really happening.

19:27.232 --> 19:31.669
And this leads people who run
Major League Baseball teams...

19:31.870 --> 19:36.000
...to misjudge their players
and mismanage their teams.

19:40.645 --> 19:42.579
I apologize.

19:43.548 --> 19:44.537
Go on.

19:47.852 --> 19:52.983
Okay. People who run ball clubs,
they think in terms of buying players.

19:53.625 --> 19:58.153
Your goal shouldn't be to buy players.
Your goal should be to buy wins.

19:58.363 --> 20:01.696
And in order to buy wins,
you need to buy runs.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.925
You're trying
to replace Johnny Damon.

20:04.436 --> 20:06.028
The Red Sox see Johnny Damon...

20:06.237 --> 20:09.866
...and they see a star
who's worth $7.5 million a year.

20:10.075 --> 20:12.942
When I see Johnny Damon...

20:13.144 --> 20:15.442
...what I see is...

20:16.881 --> 20:20.282
...an imperfect understanding
of where runs come from.

20:21.019 --> 20:22.577
The guy's got a great glove.

20:22.787 --> 20:25.722
He's a decent leadoff hitter.
He can steal bases.

20:25.924 --> 20:28.256
But is he worth the $ 7.5 million
a year...

20:28.460 --> 20:30.587
...that the Boston Red Sox
are paying him?

20:30.795 --> 20:32.626
No. No.

20:33.231 --> 20:35.062
Baseball thinking is medieval.

20:35.266 --> 20:37.734
They are asking
all the wrong questions.

20:37.936 --> 20:42.066
And if I say it to anybody,
I'm ostracized. I'm a leper.

20:42.273 --> 20:47.210
So that's why I'm cagey
about this with you.

20:47.412 --> 20:48.401
That's why...

20:48.613 --> 20:52.515
I respect you, Mr. Beane,
and if you want full disclosure...

20:53.151 --> 20:57.554
...I think it's a good thing
that you got Damon off your payroll.

20:57.756 --> 21:02.250
I think it opens up all kinds
of interesting possibilities.

21:02.460 --> 21:05.520
- Where you from, Pete?
- Maryland.

21:05.730 --> 21:08.995
- Where'd you go to school?
- Yale. I went to Yale.

21:10.135 --> 21:13.002
- What'd you study?
- Economics.

21:13.705 --> 21:16.196
I studied economics.

21:19.778 --> 21:24.112
Yale, economics and baseball.

21:25.717 --> 21:27.912
You're funny, Pete.

21:50.842 --> 21:52.036
Tell me, why Billy?

21:52.811 --> 21:55.143
What is it that makes him special?

21:55.346 --> 21:59.009
Very rare do you come upon
a young man like Billy...

21:59.217 --> 22:02.311
...who can run, who can field,
who can throw, who can hit...

22:02.520 --> 22:04.078
...and who can hit with power.

22:04.289 --> 22:07.281
Those five tools,
you don't see that very often.

22:07.992 --> 22:10.859
Most of the youngsters
that we have an interest in...

22:11.062 --> 22:12.495
...have one or two tools...

22:12.697 --> 22:15.291
...and we're hoping
to develop an extra one.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.400
Your son has five.

22:17.602 --> 22:21.595
We're looking at a guy that's a
potential superstar for us in New York.

22:21.806 --> 22:23.637
The time is now to get him started.

22:23.842 --> 22:26.640
We're prepared to make
a sizable financial commitment.

22:26.845 --> 22:29.211
The Mets are gonna
stand behind Billy...

22:29.414 --> 22:32.713
...because we expect him
to be our big-league center fielder.

22:32.917 --> 22:34.976
This check here
represents the offer...

22:35.186 --> 22:38.519
...that the New York Mets
would be making to Billy.

22:38.723 --> 22:43.820
You do know that he's been accepted
to Stanford on a full scholarship?

22:44.028 --> 22:45.154
I do.

22:45.363 --> 22:47.763
So he can do both?

22:47.966 --> 22:52.266
Unfortunately, he can't do Stanford
and professional baseball.

22:52.470 --> 22:56.338
He would have to pick one
or the other.

22:56.541 --> 22:59.009
If he wants to be center fielder
for the Mets...

22:59.210 --> 23:01.041
...wants to be a baseball player...

23:01.246 --> 23:06.115
...he really needs to accept this
as life's first occupation, first career.

23:06.317 --> 23:10.014
We're all told at some point we can
no longer play the children's game.

23:10.221 --> 23:12.689
We just don't know
when that's gonna be.

23:13.224 --> 23:17.251
Some of us are told at 18, some of us
are told at 40, but we're all told.

23:17.929 --> 23:21.126
But this is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

23:21.332 --> 23:22.356
We want you badly...

23:22.567 --> 23:25.866
...and we think that this amount
of money expresses that desire.

23:26.070 --> 23:29.403
Billy, this is your decision,
and whatever that decision is...

23:29.607 --> 23:32.075
...you know it's fine
with your mother and I.

23:42.987 --> 23:45.217
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Billy Beane.

23:46.057 --> 23:49.788
- Hey, what time is it?
- I don't know.

23:50.795 --> 23:54.925
Listen, would you have drafted me
in the first round?

23:55.133 --> 23:56.532
What?

23:56.734 --> 24:00.226
After I left,
you looked me up on your computer.

24:00.438 --> 24:02.736
Would you have drafted me
in the first round?

24:02.941 --> 24:05.842
I did, yeah.
You were a good player.

24:06.044 --> 24:08.239
Cut the crap, man.

24:08.446 --> 24:11.347
Would you have drafted me
in the first round?

24:12.050 --> 24:16.180
I'd have taken you in the ninth round.
No signing bonus.

24:17.021 --> 24:21.481
I imagine you would've passed
and taken that scholarship.

24:22.226 --> 24:24.091
Yeah.

24:27.732 --> 24:30.166
Pack your bags, Pete.

24:30.635 --> 24:33.627
I just bought you
from the Cleveland Indians.

24:47.418 --> 24:50.876
- Is it attached to that clamp?
- Yeah, let me unhook it.

24:59.364 --> 25:01.855
- Slide it up right there. To the left.
- I did.

25:02.066 --> 25:04.193
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hang on, it's wet.

25:04.402 --> 25:05.960
Come on.

25:27.759 --> 25:29.522
- Morning, Suzanne. Coffee on?
- Yes.

25:29.727 --> 25:31.058
Great.

25:31.696 --> 25:33.527
- Billy Beane's office.
- Hey.

25:33.731 --> 25:34.755
- Peter Brand.
- Billy.

25:34.966 --> 25:37.434
- How are...? Hi, how you doing?
- Nice to see you.

25:37.635 --> 25:40.160
Good to have you here.
Boy, you move in fast.

25:40.371 --> 25:43.204
Yeah, yeah.
I got here early this morning.

25:44.742 --> 25:46.869
- All moved in.
- Yeah.

25:47.612 --> 25:49.170
Yeah.

25:49.380 --> 25:51.348
Hey, Billy...

25:51.549 --> 25:54.416
...I wanted you
to see these player evaluations...

25:54.619 --> 25:56.746
...that you asked me to do.

25:57.755 --> 25:59.347
I asked you to do three.

26:00.291 --> 26:01.622
Yeah.

26:01.826 --> 26:04.351
- To evaluate three players.
- Yeah.

26:04.562 --> 26:06.496
How many did you do?

26:06.697 --> 26:08.631
Forty-seven.

26:09.567 --> 26:11.057
Okay.

26:12.003 --> 26:15.700
Actually, 51.
I don't know why I lied just then.

26:24.749 --> 26:27.149
Why don't you walk me
through the board?

26:28.619 --> 26:30.177
Thank you.

26:56.481 --> 26:58.506
Using this equation
in the upper left...

26:58.716 --> 27:01.776
...I'm projecting that we need to win
at least 99 games...

27:01.986 --> 27:04.113
...in order to make it
to the postseason.

27:04.322 --> 27:08.418
We need to score at least 814 runs
in order to win those games...

27:08.626 --> 27:11.652
...and allow no more than 645 runs.

27:16.834 --> 27:18.096
What's this?

27:18.302 --> 27:21.863
This is a code that I've written
for our year-to-year projections.

27:22.073 --> 27:25.668
This is building in the intelligence
that we have to project players.

27:25.877 --> 27:26.866
Okay.

27:27.078 --> 27:29.672
It's about getting things down
to one number.

27:30.181 --> 27:32.706
Using the stats
the way we read them...

27:32.917 --> 27:36.011
...we'll find value in players
that nobody else can see.

27:39.590 --> 27:40.852
People are overlooked...

27:41.058 --> 27:44.824
...for a variety of biased reasons
and perceived flaws.

27:45.029 --> 27:48.294
Age, appearance, personality.

27:48.499 --> 27:53.198
Bill James and mathematics
cut straight through that.

27:54.839 --> 27:58.104
Billy, of the 20,000 notable players
for us to consider...

27:58.309 --> 28:00.800
...I believe
that there is a championship team...

28:01.012 --> 28:04.140
...of 25 people that we can afford...

28:04.348 --> 28:07.476
...because everyone else in baseball
undervalues them.

28:07.685 --> 28:10.916
Like an island of misfit toys.

28:15.393 --> 28:18.590
Billy, this is Chad Bradford.
He's a relief pitcher.

28:18.796 --> 28:23.028
He is one of the most undervalued
players in baseball.

28:23.234 --> 28:26.169
His defect is that he throws funny.

28:27.038 --> 28:31.065
Nobody in the big leagues cares
about him because he looks funny.

28:31.275 --> 28:34.335
This guy could be not just
the best pitcher in our pen...

28:34.545 --> 28:37.912
...but one of the most effective
relief pitchers in all baseball.

28:38.115 --> 28:40.845
This guy should cost $3 million
a year.

28:41.052 --> 28:43.885
We can get him for 237,000.

29:07.845 --> 29:09.244
Billy.

29:10.781 --> 29:13.181
- That it?
- Yeah.

29:43.347 --> 29:44.678
Hey, Art.

29:44.882 --> 29:47.043
Can I talk to you
before you get started?

29:47.251 --> 29:49.651
- I'm a bit busy right now.
- I know.

29:51.589 --> 29:53.113
- I know.
- Okay.

29:53.324 --> 29:54.951
- Morning, everyone.
- Art.

29:55.159 --> 29:58.390
- Peter Brand. Nice to meet you.
- Where the hell's Pete?

29:58.596 --> 29:59.620
That's Pete.

30:00.564 --> 30:03.032
Grab a seat. I'll be right back.

30:04.602 --> 30:07.435
- All right, where did you say he's at?
- Okay. He's on...

30:08.172 --> 30:10.800
- Who's the kid?
- A friend of mine.

30:12.610 --> 30:15.511
I can't manage this team
under a one-year contract.

30:15.713 --> 30:17.476
Well, sure you can.

30:19.216 --> 30:21.309
No, I can't.

30:21.519 --> 30:24.044
Okay. I gotta put a team on the field.

30:24.255 --> 30:27.691
After that, I'll take a good long look
at your contract.

30:27.892 --> 30:31.157
Deal with the manager's contract,
then put a team on the field.

30:31.362 --> 30:35.731
At this moment, if a grounder's hit
to first, nobody's there to stop it.

30:36.567 --> 30:40.901
It's not easy doing what I do
under the cloud of a one-year contract.

30:41.105 --> 30:42.470
Okay, I understand that.

30:42.673 --> 30:44.607
- I've been there.
- I know you have.

30:44.809 --> 30:49.212
A one-year contract means the same
thing to a manager as to a player.

30:49.413 --> 30:51.574
There's not a lot of faith there.

30:51.782 --> 30:54.512
Which is strange
after a 102-win season.

30:55.586 --> 30:57.520
I see.

30:57.722 --> 31:02.022
If you lose the last game
of the season, nobody gives a shit.

31:04.128 --> 31:07.894
- So it's on me now?
- No, Art, it's on me.

31:08.099 --> 31:11.398
And the kid is the new assistant GM.

31:11.602 --> 31:13.593
- Okay.
- Okay, fellas.

31:13.804 --> 31:15.396
Hey, Billy.

31:25.816 --> 31:28.512
You can't deny his offensive output.
He can play.

31:28.719 --> 31:31.688
And we need people that can play.

31:37.928 --> 31:40.260
Who do you wanna talk about first?

31:57.081 --> 31:59.049
None of them.

31:59.817 --> 32:02.752
Billy, we got 38 home runs,
120 RBIs to make up for.

32:02.953 --> 32:05.285
Guys, you're still trying
to replace Giambi.

32:05.489 --> 32:08.947
I told you we can't do it,
and we can't do it.

32:09.560 --> 32:13.724
Now, what we might be able to do
is re-create him.

32:13.931 --> 32:16.900
- Re-create him in the aggregate.
- The what?

32:17.101 --> 32:19.831
Giambi's on-base percentage
was .477.

32:20.037 --> 32:24.440
Damon's on-base, .324.
And Olmedo's was .291.

32:24.642 --> 32:26.837
Add that up and you get...

32:29.513 --> 32:30.775
Do you want me to speak?

32:31.849 --> 32:33.680
When I point at you, yeah.

32:33.884 --> 32:36.785
- 1.092.
- Divided by three.

32:36.987 --> 32:39.717
- .364.
- That's what we're looking for.

32:39.924 --> 32:44.020
Three ballplayers... Three ballplayers
whose average OBP is...

32:44.228 --> 32:45.525
.364.

32:45.729 --> 32:48.562
- Wait, that doesn't come out right.
- It's right, Artie.

32:49.333 --> 32:50.994
- Billy.
- You gotta carry the one.

32:51.202 --> 32:53.568
- Billy.
- Scratch this out.

32:53.771 --> 32:56.569
- Yeah?
- Who's that?

32:56.774 --> 32:58.366
That's Pete.

32:59.310 --> 33:03.041
- Does Pete really need to be here?
- Yes, he does.

33:04.682 --> 33:07.014
Okay, here's who we want.

33:07.218 --> 33:10.449
Number one:
Jason's little brother, Jeremy.

33:10.654 --> 33:13.487
- Oh, God.
- Billy, that's trouble.

33:13.691 --> 33:15.420
Billy, look, if I... Yeah.

33:15.626 --> 33:18.561
Billy, if I may,
he has had his problems off the field...

33:18.762 --> 33:21.060
...and we know what he can't do
on the field.

33:21.265 --> 33:23.130
He's getting thick around the waist.

33:23.334 --> 33:25.962
There's reports about him on weed,
in strip clubs.

33:26.170 --> 33:28.798
His on-base percentage
is all we're looking at now.

33:29.006 --> 33:34.376
And Jeremy gets on base an awful lot
for a guy who only costs 285,000.

33:34.578 --> 33:37.547
- Jeez, Billy...
- Number two:

33:39.216 --> 33:41.047
- David Justice.
- Oh, no.

33:41.252 --> 33:43.117
- His legs are gone.
- Not a good idea.

33:43.320 --> 33:44.878
- Old Man Justice?
- Why is that?

33:45.089 --> 33:47.216
Steinbrenner's so pissed
at his decline...

33:47.424 --> 33:50.188
...he's willing to eat his contract
to get rid of him.

33:50.394 --> 33:53.090
- Exactly.
- Ten years ago, Justice, big name.

33:53.297 --> 33:54.286
Been in big games.

33:54.498 --> 33:57.695
He's gonna really help
our season tickets early in the year...

33:57.902 --> 34:02.498
...but in the dog days in July, August,
we're lucky if he's gonna hit his weight.

34:02.706 --> 34:06.335
Billy, his legs are gone,
and he's a defensive liability.

34:06.544 --> 34:08.670
I question
whether the bat speed's there.

34:08.879 --> 34:10.210
- His legs are gone.
- Grady.

34:10.414 --> 34:14.373
We'll be lucky to get 60 games
out of him. Why do you like him?

34:15.485 --> 34:16.748
Because he gets on base.

34:18.656 --> 34:20.351
- What is this?
- What are we doing?

34:20.558 --> 34:22.583
Okay, number three:

34:28.498 --> 34:30.364
- Scott Hatteberg.
- Who?

34:30.568 --> 34:31.592
- Hatteberg?
- Exactly.

34:31.802 --> 34:33.632
He sounds like an Oakland A
already.

34:33.837 --> 34:37.795
- Yes, he's had a little problem with...
- Little problem? He can't throw.

34:38.007 --> 34:41.637
He's a career .260 hitter.
The best part of his career is over.

34:41.844 --> 34:44.574
- It's just getting started.
- Boston wants to cut him.

34:44.782 --> 34:47.273
- No one wants to pick him up.
- Good. He's cheap.

34:47.484 --> 34:50.112
Let me get this straight.
You're gonna get a guy...

34:50.321 --> 34:53.620
...that's been released
by half the organizations in baseball...

34:53.824 --> 34:57.954
...because he's got nonrepairable nerve
damage in his elbow and can't throw.

34:58.162 --> 35:01.495
He can't throw and he can't field.
But what can he do?

35:01.699 --> 35:02.688
Oh, boy.

35:02.900 --> 35:05.266
Check your reports
or I'm gonna point at Pete.

35:05.469 --> 35:07.937
- He gets on base.
- He can get on base.

35:08.138 --> 35:10.698
- So he walks a lot.
- He gets on base a lot, Rocco.

35:10.908 --> 35:13.502
Do I care if it's a walk or a hit?

35:13.711 --> 35:15.042
Pete?

35:15.245 --> 35:17.440
- You do not.
- I do not.

35:17.648 --> 35:20.674
I got 37 free agents
that are better than those three guys.

35:20.884 --> 35:23.079
Wait a minute,
let me get this straight.

35:23.287 --> 35:25.915
So you're not gonna bring in one...

35:26.123 --> 35:29.422
...but three defective players
to replace Giambi?

35:30.160 --> 35:32.628
You're not buying into
this Bill James bullshit?

35:32.830 --> 35:34.764
This is the new direction of the A's.

35:34.965 --> 35:37.832
We are card counters
at the blackjack table...

35:38.035 --> 35:40.731
...and we're gonna turn the odds
on the casino.

35:42.106 --> 35:43.801
- I don't see it.
- Seriously, guys.

35:44.008 --> 35:46.670
I think we have to remember
this is the man.

35:46.877 --> 35:52.281
He answers to no one
except ownership and God.

35:52.483 --> 35:55.316
And he doesn't have to answer
to us.

35:55.519 --> 35:57.919
We make suggestions,
he makes decisions.

35:58.122 --> 36:01.489
That's all fine and well, but we've been
working our asses off...

36:01.692 --> 36:05.492
...for weeks to make this club better,
and you're shitting all over it.

36:05.696 --> 36:08.164
This is not a discussion.

36:10.634 --> 36:13.899
- What are we discussing?
- Barry, not a discussion.

36:18.909 --> 36:21.537
Billy, man...

36:22.413 --> 36:24.472
...there's one thing you're forgetting.

36:25.115 --> 36:29.814
None of those three guys
knows how to play first base.

36:30.020 --> 36:32.318
Well, you're gonna have
to teach one of them.

36:32.523 --> 36:33.888
Teach?

36:35.059 --> 36:36.720
Which one?

36:48.305 --> 36:52.173
This is really the kickoff to the holiday
season here in downtown Seattle.

36:52.376 --> 36:53.809
It took weeks of planning...

36:54.011 --> 36:56.946
...to lead up to the big event,
but it was well worth it.

36:57.147 --> 37:00.548
The weather was ideal.
People are still having a great time.

37:00.751 --> 37:02.616
Thousands of people
were out earlier.

37:02.820 --> 37:04.412
We have a nice recap for you...

37:04.621 --> 37:08.580
...of all the great events taking place
downtown in Seattle...

37:12.196 --> 37:13.754
- Hello?
- Scott?

37:13.964 --> 37:14.953
Yes.

37:15.165 --> 37:18.134
- It's Billy Beane of the Oakland A's.
- Yes.

37:18.335 --> 37:21.168
- Can we talk?
- Yeah.

37:21.371 --> 37:23.271
Do you wanna let us in?

37:24.308 --> 37:26.833
- Pardon me?
- We're out front.

37:28.312 --> 37:30.439
- What?
- On the curb.

37:30.681 --> 37:32.410
Yeah, yeah.

37:34.384 --> 37:35.408
Honey?

37:39.823 --> 37:41.791
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you, ma'am.

37:41.992 --> 37:43.653
Very kind.

37:47.197 --> 37:48.994
How's the elbow, Scott?

37:49.199 --> 37:52.498
You know, it's good.
It's really good. It's great.

37:59.076 --> 38:01.135
- I can't throw the ball at all.
- Yeah.

38:01.345 --> 38:04.041
You've thrown your last ball
from behind home plate.

38:04.248 --> 38:06.409
- That's what I'd say.
- Well...

38:07.151 --> 38:10.416
Good news is, we want you at first.

38:17.761 --> 38:21.253
We want you to play first base
for the Oakland A's.

38:22.466 --> 38:24.627
Okay, well...

38:24.835 --> 38:26.564
...I've only ever played catcher.

38:26.770 --> 38:29.204
Scott, you're not a catcher anymore.

38:30.307 --> 38:33.708
If you were, our call wouldn't
have been the only one you got.

38:34.645 --> 38:38.775
- Yeah. Hey, listen, no, I appreciate it.
- You're welcome.

38:38.982 --> 38:43.681
- But the thing is, is...
- You don't know how to play first base.

38:44.321 --> 38:45.379
- Scott.
- That's right.

38:45.889 --> 38:47.447
It's not that hard, Scott.

38:47.658 --> 38:49.819
- Tell him, Wash.
- It's incredibly hard.

38:50.027 --> 38:53.155
Hey, anything worth doing is.
And we're gonna teach you.

38:53.363 --> 38:55.661
Wait a minute here.
I mean, but what about...?

38:55.866 --> 38:57.959
Jason's gone, Scott.

38:58.468 --> 39:00.959
You want me to take Giambi's spot
at first base?

39:01.171 --> 39:02.570
- Yeah.
- What about the fans?

39:02.773 --> 39:06.072
- Maybe I can teach one of them.
- The fans don't... Good one.

39:06.276 --> 39:09.973
- Fans don't run my ball club.
- Honey, what are you doing awake?

39:10.747 --> 39:12.738
Sweetheart, can you...?

39:13.917 --> 39:15.680
That's my daughter.

39:17.120 --> 39:19.020
You got kids?

39:20.190 --> 39:21.817
Yeah, a daughter.

39:22.025 --> 39:26.428
Scott, this is a contract to play ball
for the Oakland A's.

39:26.630 --> 39:28.655
A copy's been sent over
to your agent.

39:28.866 --> 39:31.699
Discuss with your wife, let us know.

39:32.769 --> 39:33.963
Thank you.

39:34.171 --> 39:35.399
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

39:35.606 --> 39:37.574
- Oh, and, Scott.
- Yeah?

39:37.774 --> 39:40.072
Don't tell anyone
about the first-base thing.

39:40.277 --> 39:41.266
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

39:41.478 --> 39:43.912
- Happy holidays.
- All right.

40:09.573 --> 40:10.801
- Hey, Sharon.
- Hi, Billy.

40:11.008 --> 40:14.205
- Is she ready?
- She's out with friends.

40:15.345 --> 40:17.404
But she'll be back. Come in.

40:18.181 --> 40:20.479
- Okay.
- Yeah, she's right here. Hold on.

40:20.684 --> 40:21.981
Here you go.

40:24.121 --> 40:27.716
- Here, wanna have a seat?
- Yeah.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.630
- You good, Billy?
- Yeah. How are you, Alan?

40:38.835 --> 40:42.202
Good. Really good.
Things are peaceful around here.

40:44.274 --> 40:46.299
It's good to see you.

40:46.510 --> 40:48.444
Thanks, Alan.

40:48.645 --> 40:50.738
I haven't got to see you
since play-offs.

40:50.948 --> 40:53.416
I wanted to say
that New York was heartbreaking.

40:54.084 --> 40:55.449
I'm sure for you too.

40:55.652 --> 40:59.588
Not many teams make it that far,
and to watch you go that far was...

40:59.790 --> 41:05.251
- It was really an accomplishment.
- Well, that's nice.

41:06.129 --> 41:08.324
How is the team shaping up?

41:08.532 --> 41:12.263
- Team's good. Rebuilding.
- Good.

41:12.469 --> 41:15.495
I read you lost Giambonni
and Damon.

41:15.706 --> 41:16.695
- Giambi.
- Giambi.

41:16.907 --> 41:19.501
- Yeah.
- Damon, Isringhausen.

41:19.710 --> 41:23.669
- They're really...? They're gone?
- Gone. Yesterday's news.

41:23.880 --> 41:27.247
- That's terrible.
- No, but that is a tough situation.

41:27.451 --> 41:29.043
That's...

41:29.252 --> 41:32.585
You're gonna be fine, though.
You always figure something out.

41:36.460 --> 41:39.691
Where is she? Where was she?
Down the street or...?

41:39.896 --> 41:43.855
Oh, sorry, yeah. I just talked to her
on her cell. She's coming up the hill.

41:44.067 --> 41:45.329
Okay.

41:45.535 --> 41:47.730
She's got a cell phone?

41:48.238 --> 41:50.798
- Yeah.
- A 12-year-old?

41:51.008 --> 41:52.475
Yeah.

41:55.412 --> 41:56.572
For emergencies.

41:58.582 --> 42:00.709
Big parenting decision.

42:01.251 --> 42:05.347
But it's something that, you know,
we, you know, all should discuss...

42:05.555 --> 42:08.991
...because if you have any objections,
of course...

42:09.192 --> 42:11.626
Her mother and I will discuss it.

42:12.529 --> 42:14.190
But thank you.

42:17.234 --> 42:19.031
Any of these?

42:19.703 --> 42:21.170
I don't know.

42:21.371 --> 42:23.362
- Do you...?
- This one's cool.

42:23.573 --> 42:27.168
- Is that good or bad? Butterflies.
- They're okay.

42:27.377 --> 42:32.076
- Look, that one's pretty. I like the red.
- Should we try?

42:32.883 --> 42:34.111
No?

42:34.317 --> 42:35.875
- Oh, I like this one.
- Yeah?

42:36.086 --> 42:37.451
Dad, look at this one.

42:37.654 --> 42:39.884
- Look how it's red.
- It's beautiful.

42:40.090 --> 42:42.422
- This one's pretty.
- Let's try it out.

42:42.626 --> 42:44.992
- Just right here?
- Why don't we go over there?

42:45.195 --> 42:46.685
Can we go over there?

43:05.282 --> 43:09.309
Oh, honey, you need to sing.
That's so good.

43:10.087 --> 43:12.146
That's beautiful.

43:13.723 --> 43:14.712
Sometimes I sing.

43:14.925 --> 43:20.557
It's fun to sing with your song,
but I don't want people to listen to me.

43:20.764 --> 43:24.598
Well, honey, I think people would love
to listen to you. That's beautiful.

43:25.602 --> 43:28.696
Would you sing a little for your dad?

43:28.905 --> 43:30.998
Right here
in the middle of the store?

43:33.877 --> 43:36.243
- Little bit.
- Little bit.

43:38.048 --> 43:39.709
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

43:39.916 --> 43:41.110
Okay.

44:15.619 --> 44:18.816
Billy Beane was taken
in the first round of the amateur draft.

44:19.022 --> 44:21.252
I think this is a steal,
to get Billy Beane.

44:21.458 --> 44:22.948
He's young, he's talented.

44:23.160 --> 44:27.460
A true five-tool player with speed.
This guy is a can't-miss prospect.

44:27.664 --> 44:29.859
This is a great sign
for the New York Mets.

44:30.066 --> 44:33.502
And it could be the turnaround
that they've been looking for.

44:33.970 --> 44:35.403
Ball one.

44:35.605 --> 44:38.096
I'll take Billy Beane
over Strawberry.

44:38.308 --> 44:41.675
Billy Beane, an interesting pick,
turned down a scholarship.

44:41.878 --> 44:43.368
He could've gone to Stanford.

44:43.580 --> 44:46.879
Sometimes you don't find out
till you get to the big leagues...

44:48.051 --> 44:51.680
This guy has never failed at anything.
He's coming out of high school.

44:51.888 --> 44:55.483
Billy was gonna go to college.
He could've been a great quarterback.

45:03.366 --> 45:05.197
Strike three.

45:05.735 --> 45:09.034
There's not an organization
in baseball...

45:09.239 --> 45:14.871
...who would not have taken a chance
on this young guy.

45:15.645 --> 45:19.012
He didn't pan out.
That happens every year.

45:20.517 --> 45:23.315
Some do, some don't.

45:24.621 --> 45:27.522
I mean, if you're having any doubt
at all about this...

45:30.026 --> 45:31.459
Having the scholarship...

45:31.661 --> 45:34.687
Your son was born
with a God-given ability.

45:35.432 --> 45:39.061
Few scouts can go into the mind
of a young man...

45:39.269 --> 45:42.466
...and determine
whether he's really confident...

45:42.672 --> 45:43.900
...about what he can do.

45:44.107 --> 45:45.802
A very special player.

45:46.009 --> 45:48.569
So you can sign him
based on his ability...

45:48.778 --> 45:52.305
...but then he's gotta be successful
to be confident.

45:52.515 --> 45:57.111
And once he becomes confident,
that's when you've got something.

46:00.624 --> 46:03.821
You make a decision
on what you see.

46:04.027 --> 46:07.519
And if things don't pan out,
you move on.

46:07.731 --> 46:09.722
That's baseball.

46:09.933 --> 46:11.924
Many are called, few are chosen.

46:13.803 --> 46:18.570
Billy, that is Kevin Youkilis.
That is the Greek God of Walks.

46:18.775 --> 46:20.072
That's my hero.

46:20.277 --> 46:23.246
That man gets walked
more than anybody in baseball...

46:23.446 --> 46:25.346
...except for Barry Bonds.

46:25.548 --> 46:29.006
I tried to convince Shapiro
to pick him up last June...

46:29.219 --> 46:31.551
...but he said he waddled
like a duck.

46:32.088 --> 46:34.249
Yeah, Boston snagged him.

46:34.457 --> 46:36.322
I think they wanna wait and see.

46:43.333 --> 46:46.496
- Are you okay, Billy?
- Billy?

46:47.137 --> 46:51.301
- Can we talk?
- Yeah. Yeah.

47:01.751 --> 47:04.481
You're unhappy, Grady. Why?

47:10.460 --> 47:12.724
- May I speak candidly?
- Sure, go ahead.

47:12.929 --> 47:16.763
Major League Baseball and its fans,
they're gonna be more than happy...

47:16.966 --> 47:19.366
...to throw you and Google Boy
under the bus...

47:19.569 --> 47:21.537
...if you keep doing
what you're doing.

47:21.738 --> 47:24.104
You don't put a team together
with a computer.

47:24.307 --> 47:26.002
- No?
- No.

47:26.209 --> 47:28.871
Baseball isn't just numbers.
It's not science.

47:29.079 --> 47:32.242
If it was, anybody could do
what we're doing, but they can't.

47:32.449 --> 47:34.144
They don't know what we know.

47:34.351 --> 47:37.411
They don't have our experience
and our intuition.

47:37.954 --> 47:39.012
Okay.

47:39.656 --> 47:43.092
You got a kid in there that's got
a degree in economics from Yale.

47:43.293 --> 47:46.387
You got a scout here
with 29 years of baseball experience.

47:46.596 --> 47:49.156
You're listening to the wrong one.

47:49.366 --> 47:53.166
Now, there are intangibles
that only baseball people understand.

47:53.370 --> 47:56.601
You're discounting
what scouts have done for 150 years?

47:56.806 --> 47:58.797
Even yourself?

47:59.509 --> 48:01.636
Adapt or die.

48:04.481 --> 48:06.779
This is about you and your shit,
isn't it?

48:06.983 --> 48:09.918
Twenty years ago,
some scout got it wrong.

48:10.120 --> 48:12.680
- Okay. Okay.
- Now you declare war on the system.

48:12.889 --> 48:17.553
Okay, okay, my turn.
You don't have a crystal ball.

48:17.761 --> 48:21.322
You can't look at a kid and predict
his future any more than I can.

48:21.531 --> 48:23.761
I've sat at those kitchen tables
with you...

48:23.967 --> 48:26.959
...and listened to you tell parents,
"When I know, I know.

48:27.170 --> 48:29.138
And when it comes to your son,
I know."

48:29.339 --> 48:31.739
And you don't.

48:33.376 --> 48:35.139
You don't.

48:37.680 --> 48:40.080
Okay. I don't give a shit
about friendship...

48:40.283 --> 48:42.808
...this situation, or the past.

48:43.019 --> 48:46.580
Major League Baseball thinks
the way I think. You're not gonna win.

48:46.790 --> 48:49.350
And I'll give you a nickel's worth
of free advice.

48:49.559 --> 48:51.823
You're never gonna
get another job...

48:52.028 --> 48:55.555
...after this catastrophic season
you're about to set us all up for.

48:55.765 --> 48:57.733
You'll have to explain to your kid...

48:57.934 --> 49:00.425
...why you're working
at Dick's Sporting Goods.

49:06.242 --> 49:08.676
I'm not gonna fire you, Grady.

49:12.549 --> 49:15.643
- Fuck you, Billy.
- Now I will.

49:19.522 --> 49:21.422
Good luck, Art.

49:27.564 --> 49:30.590
Kubota.
You never played ball, right?

49:30.800 --> 49:33.598
- I played a little T-ball.
- You're the new head scout.

49:33.803 --> 49:35.464
Congratulations.

49:43.947 --> 49:46.245
So Boston's gonna wait and see?

49:47.884 --> 49:49.215
Yeah.

49:50.553 --> 49:53.021
- Yeah.
- It's just you and me, Pete.

49:53.223 --> 49:54.952
And we're all in.

49:58.828 --> 50:01.763
It sounds like you're apologizing
for what they're doing.

50:01.965 --> 50:04.627
I'm not. I just don't know
what you're gonna do...

50:04.834 --> 50:08.167
...with the budget that the A's have.
Who are you gonna get?

50:08.371 --> 50:10.498
I'm looking
at the spring-training roster.

50:10.707 --> 50:12.402
- You gotta be kidding me.
- How so?

50:12.609 --> 50:14.668
- He looked like a clown out there.
- Who?

50:16.079 --> 50:18.445
- Chad Bradford.
- Tell me about Bradford.

50:18.648 --> 50:21.048
I like him a little bit,
but he's a specialist.

50:21.251 --> 50:24.277
He's not a guy that you say,
"The eighth inning is yours...

50:24.487 --> 50:26.284
...lefties vs. Righties."

50:26.489 --> 50:28.116
In my opinion.

50:28.324 --> 50:30.724
I don't know what Billy Beane
and management...

50:30.927 --> 50:32.224
...understands about him.

50:32.428 --> 50:35.056
He only throws the ball
about 82, 83 miles an hour.

50:35.265 --> 50:38.666
- There must be something...
- He is a freak, and not in a good way.

50:40.069 --> 50:43.266
- Let me ask you this.
- Talking about trying to win a division.

50:43.473 --> 50:45.771
We're counting on David
to be the guy he was.

50:45.975 --> 50:48.443
I have my doubts. He's gotten old.

50:48.645 --> 50:52.081
That's why he's not in New York
anymore, not in Cleveland anymore.

50:52.282 --> 50:55.615
We paid him the money we should've
been giving to Johnny Damon.

50:55.818 --> 50:56.842
- Hey.
- Jeremy Giambi.

50:58.254 --> 50:59.812
That's the one to worry about.

51:00.023 --> 51:02.753
He gets comps up and down Vegas
more than in Oakland.

51:02.959 --> 51:05.291
That should tell you something
right there.

51:05.495 --> 51:09.022
- Isn't that the deal with these guys?
- He has one good year.

51:09.432 --> 51:12.868
And he gets a huge offer
and then he gets traded.

51:15.271 --> 51:18.365
- Bob. Harder.
- Hatteberg.

51:21.511 --> 51:24.708
Good. Good.

51:25.648 --> 51:27.775
Billy, we have to talk
about Hatteberg.

51:27.984 --> 51:30.418
- Go.
- There's just no feel for the spot.

51:30.620 --> 51:34.112
I think it's a long shot that he can be
a big-league first baseman.

51:34.324 --> 51:37.589
It's day one of the first week.
You can't judge this yet.

51:37.794 --> 51:39.352
No, I think we can judge it.

51:39.562 --> 51:43.794
I mean, I like him, you know,
but I can judge him.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.592
First base is the moon to him.

51:45.802 --> 51:49.636
It wasn't to Giambi. Giambi's the worst
first baseman in baseball.

51:49.839 --> 51:53.297
- Gonna compare him to Giambi?
- What are we talking about?

51:53.509 --> 51:54.771
All right.

51:56.813 --> 51:58.075
What do you think, Wash?

51:58.648 --> 52:02.084
The nice way to say it
is he lacks confidence.

52:02.285 --> 52:03.752
Well, give him some.

52:04.487 --> 52:07.047
I'll do that, but we got Peña,
who can play first.

52:07.256 --> 52:09.622
And he's looking mighty good
out there.

52:10.460 --> 52:12.519
We wanna go with Hattie.

52:17.567 --> 52:19.091
We got six weeks.

52:19.302 --> 52:21.167
Get down in it.

52:27.343 --> 52:28.640
- There you go.
- Scotty H.

52:28.845 --> 52:31.473
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Picking machine.

52:31.681 --> 52:33.979
It's only baseball.

52:40.189 --> 52:42.214
This better work.

52:43.559 --> 52:45.459
I'm just kidding you.

52:58.908 --> 53:01.775
Let's go, Oakland!

53:01.978 --> 53:04.242
Let's go, Oakland!

53:06.716 --> 53:10.049
- What is wrong with this thing?
- It's a dollar, man.

53:10.253 --> 53:12.653
- What?
- Welcome to Oakland, D.J.

53:12.855 --> 53:14.846
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

53:15.058 --> 53:18.858
I think this year, we're gonna show
that it takes a team to win...

53:19.062 --> 53:21.189
...not any individual guy,
just a team.

53:21.397 --> 53:24.764
And I think we got
a hell of a ball club here.

53:24.967 --> 53:26.958
Chad, are you intimidated
at all today?

53:27.170 --> 53:32.335
I wouldn't say I'm intimidated, really.
I'm just really excited, like you said.

53:32.542 --> 53:36.000
Jeremy, how's the team gonna fare
without your brother, Jason?

53:36.212 --> 53:38.874
Well, you know,
the organization did a great job...

53:39.082 --> 53:41.744
...of bringing in good young guys
to fill that role.

53:41.951 --> 53:44.351
Let's face it,
they're getting a deal with you.

53:44.554 --> 53:46.784
The Yankees are paying Jason a lot
of money.

53:46.989 --> 53:50.015
You are coming here on a dime.
How does that make you feel?

53:50.226 --> 53:52.126
I feel good.

53:52.328 --> 53:55.263
- How are the nerves in your fingers?
- You know.

53:55.465 --> 53:57.490
Gotta start with the age,
36 years old.

53:57.700 --> 53:59.895
How do you think
your body's gonna hold up?

54:00.103 --> 54:03.266
You spend a lot of time at strip clubs,
partying.

54:03.473 --> 54:06.033
Do you resent the attention you get
off the field?

54:06.242 --> 54:07.231
I love it.

54:07.443 --> 54:09.604
- You spend a lot of time in Vegas.
- I do.

54:09.812 --> 54:14.010
- I feel great. I did a lot of work to get...
- Excuse me. Get out of my shot.

54:14.217 --> 54:15.206
Sorry, go ahead.

54:15.418 --> 54:17.511
There have been questions
about my age...

54:17.720 --> 54:21.417
...and my declining skills, some say,
but I'm here to prove that wrong.

54:21.624 --> 54:23.285
I asked if you were 100 percent.

54:32.301 --> 54:34.132
- Excuse me, Mr. Beane?
- Hey, Chad.

54:34.337 --> 54:37.602
- Hey, I'm not disturbing you, am I?
- Not at all. What's up?

54:37.807 --> 54:40.867
I wanted to say thank you
for this opportunity.

54:41.077 --> 54:44.513
Well, we enjoy having you.
It's gonna work out well for all of us.

54:44.714 --> 54:48.582
I appreciate it, sir. Nobody's ever
given me a chance like this before.

54:49.218 --> 54:50.242
Nobody?

54:51.387 --> 54:53.412
Well, just you, sir.

54:54.023 --> 54:57.356
Well, it's a big day,
one you won't forget.

54:57.560 --> 54:59.687
Appreciate it.
And I wanna let you know...

54:59.896 --> 55:02.694
...I'm gonna be praying for you
and your family.

55:03.266 --> 55:04.995
No problem.

55:05.668 --> 55:09.229
Well, here we are just minutes away
from the season opener of 2002...

55:09.438 --> 55:10.598
...for the Oakland A's.

55:10.807 --> 55:12.468
The first pitch is moments away.

55:12.675 --> 55:14.768
We'll come back
with the national anthem.

55:14.977 --> 55:16.342
Opening day is upon us.

55:16.913 --> 55:20.371
All right, fellas, smile. Here we go.

55:28.724 --> 55:30.692
I'm going in.
Text me the play-by-play.

55:30.893 --> 55:32.451
What? Why?

55:33.429 --> 55:35.329
I don't watch the games.

55:43.906 --> 55:45.464
Detail, halt!

55:46.876 --> 55:49.709
And forward face!

56:50.339 --> 56:52.967
That's the third Ranger batter
to be hit today.

56:53.175 --> 56:57.635
Twice Alex Rodriguez was nicked.
The ninth...

57:31.814 --> 57:35.477
I should've made you a bigger part
of the conversation from day one.

57:35.685 --> 57:37.653
It'd be clear what we're trying to do.

57:37.853 --> 57:40.788
That was my mistake, Art.
I take responsibility for that.

57:40.990 --> 57:44.357
- What are you trying to say?
- Doesn't matter what moves I make...

57:44.560 --> 57:47.529
...if you don't play the team
the way they're designed to be.

57:49.365 --> 57:51.629
Billy, you're out of your depth.

57:52.835 --> 57:55.827
- Why not Hatteberg at first?
- Because he can't play first.

57:56.038 --> 57:58.438
- How do you know?
- Not my first baseball game.

57:58.641 --> 58:01.303
- Scott Hatteberg can't hit.
- He gets on base.

58:01.510 --> 58:04.877
Still keeps us in the plus column.
We need to be seven over .500.

58:05.081 --> 58:06.605
What?

58:10.052 --> 58:12.145
Anything else?

58:12.355 --> 58:16.587
Yeah. I would've rather seen
Bradford in the end than Magnante.

58:17.226 --> 58:18.250
Bradford's a righty.

58:18.461 --> 58:21.521
- I don't care about righty-lefty.
- I do.

58:26.202 --> 58:29.296
- Could this be about your contract?
- No.

58:30.072 --> 58:33.838
This is about you doing your job
and me doing mine.

58:34.043 --> 58:35.533
Mine's me being left alone...

58:35.745 --> 58:38.646
...to manage this team
you assembled for me.

58:38.848 --> 58:42.375
- I didn't assemble them for you, Art.
- No shit.

58:50.826 --> 58:52.259
Good meeting.

58:52.461 --> 58:53.519
Every time we talk...

58:53.729 --> 58:56.493
...I'm reinvigorated
by my love of the game.

59:19.889 --> 59:23.290
We got Grady Fuson, former head
of scouting with the Athletics.

59:23.492 --> 59:26.222
And, Grady, can you interpret for us
what's going on?

59:26.429 --> 59:28.556
- They call it Moneyball.
- Moneyball?

59:28.764 --> 59:33.258
Yes, and it was a nice theory,
and now it's just not working out.

59:33.469 --> 59:37.462
Billy Beane has built this team
on the ideas of a guy, Bill James...

59:37.673 --> 59:42.269
...who wrote an interesting book
on baseball statistics.

59:42.478 --> 59:46.437
The problem is that Bill James
never played, never managed.

59:46.649 --> 59:49.982
He was in fact a security guard
at a pork-and-beans company.

59:51.387 --> 59:54.049
Do you see this as a decimation
of the organization?

59:54.256 --> 59:56.724
- He bought a ticket on the Titanic.
- Oh, boy.

59:56.926 --> 59:59.121
He's tried to come up
with a new approach.

59:59.328 --> 01:00:02.559
My hat's off to him. It won't work.

01:00:03.365 --> 01:00:06.357
One-two pitch. Tejada strikes out.

01:00:06.569 --> 01:00:07.695
And that is the game.

01:00:07.903 --> 01:00:10.929
The Seattle Mariners
win both games on this series, Ray.

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:14.667
They've won 10 in a row.
Seattle is 13 and 3.

01:00:17.346 --> 01:00:19.644
I can't watch this shit.

01:00:20.816 --> 01:00:22.340
Go on the road with the team.

01:00:22.551 --> 01:00:24.712
You don't go on the road
with the team.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:28.481
- That's why I want you to do it.
- Why don't you?

01:00:30.025 --> 01:00:32.858
I can't develop personal relationships
with these guys.

01:00:33.062 --> 01:00:37.556
I gotta be able to trade them,
send them down, sometimes cut them.

01:00:39.768 --> 01:00:42.669
Which is something
you should learn to do, by the way.

01:00:45.374 --> 01:00:48.434
I would never have to cut a player,
unless you...

01:00:49.211 --> 01:00:52.203
- Oh, come on.
- "Come on" what?

01:00:52.414 --> 01:00:54.882
- Let's practice.
- No.

01:00:55.084 --> 01:00:57.917
Yeah. I'm a player.
You gotta cut me from the roster.

01:00:58.120 --> 01:00:59.109
- No.
- Go.

01:00:59.321 --> 01:01:00.754
- What do you mean, no?
- No.

01:01:00.956 --> 01:01:02.548
- Do it.
- This is stupid.

01:01:03.025 --> 01:01:05.118
Part of the job, man.

01:01:09.565 --> 01:01:11.055
Fine.

01:01:12.401 --> 01:01:15.837
Billy, please have a seat.
I need to talk to you for a minute.

01:01:16.038 --> 01:01:17.528
Go on.

01:01:18.908 --> 01:01:20.967
You've been a huge part
of this team.

01:01:21.177 --> 01:01:23.941
But sometimes you have to
make decisions for the team.

01:01:24.146 --> 01:01:25.704
I'm sure you can understand.

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:28.907
- You're cutting me?
- I'm really sorry.

01:01:29.752 --> 01:01:31.242
I just bought a house here.

01:01:31.453 --> 01:01:33.080
- Well...
- In Oakland.

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:38.417
Well... Well...

01:01:38.627 --> 01:01:41.824
"Well... Well..."?
That's all you got to say?

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:44.363
My kid just started a new school.

01:01:44.567 --> 01:01:47.866
- They made friends.
- That's...

01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:51.234
You shouldn't pull them out
in the middle of the year.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:54.273
- You should wait.
- What the hell are you talking about?

01:01:54.476 --> 01:01:56.273
I don't know. I shouldn't have...

01:01:56.478 --> 01:01:58.912
I'm not gonna do this.
I think this is stupid.

01:01:59.114 --> 01:02:02.277
I'm not gonna fire anybody,
and this is dumb.

01:02:03.385 --> 01:02:06.582
They're professional ballplayers.
Just be straight with them.

01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:08.723
No fluff, just facts.

01:02:08.924 --> 01:02:13.725
Pete, I gotta let you go.
Jack's office will handle the details.

01:02:16.498 --> 01:02:17.988
That's it?

01:02:19.101 --> 01:02:20.090
Really?

01:02:20.302 --> 01:02:24.705
You rather get a bullet to the head or
five to the chest and bleed to death?

01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:28.936
Are those my only two options?

01:02:29.144 --> 01:02:31.305
Go on the road with the team.

01:02:33.949 --> 01:02:35.541
Okay.

01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:46.417
Say, bro.

01:02:46.629 --> 01:02:48.620
- Let me ask you a question.
- Yeah.

01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:51.664
How come your boss doesn't travel
with the team?

01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:57.096
He doesn't like to mingle
with the players.

01:02:58.941 --> 01:03:01.501
Is that supposed to make us
easier to cut?

01:03:06.749 --> 01:03:08.842
I don't know. I don't know.

01:03:09.051 --> 01:03:13.818
And how come soda
is a dollar in the clubhouse?

01:03:14.023 --> 01:03:16.253
I never seen nothing like that.

01:03:17.526 --> 01:03:20.324
Billy likes to keep the money
on the field.

01:03:20.529 --> 01:03:22.394
Soda money?

01:03:22.898 --> 01:03:24.388
Really?

01:03:24.933 --> 01:03:28.300
Where on the field
is the dollar I'm paying for soda?

01:03:29.938 --> 01:03:33.339
It's hard to see exactly...

01:03:33.542 --> 01:03:36.477
...but it's there, yeah.
- Yeah, it is hard to see.

01:03:37.146 --> 01:03:38.670
I'm done.

01:03:49.858 --> 01:03:52.588
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi, honey.

01:03:52.795 --> 01:03:54.763
- How are you?
- I'm good.

01:03:54.963 --> 01:03:57.022
- Was it bumpy?
- It was okay.

01:03:59.535 --> 01:04:02.163
So with this loss tonight,
the Oakland Athletics...

01:04:02.371 --> 01:04:05.499
...incredibly, have lost 14
of their last 17 games.

01:04:07.643 --> 01:04:10.669
They are 10 games back
in the American League West.

01:04:10.879 --> 01:04:13.347
Is it fair to say
the experiment has failed?

01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:15.847
Well, absolutely. It was predictable.

01:04:16.051 --> 01:04:18.986
You don't wish anybody
a lack of success...

01:04:19.188 --> 01:04:22.555
...but the facts are in front of you.
- You can't blame Art Howe.

01:04:22.758 --> 01:04:24.783
- No.
- The fact of the matter is...

01:04:24.993 --> 01:04:27.985
...this is not about statistics,
this is about people.

01:04:28.197 --> 01:04:30.927
Art Howe is not the problem.

01:04:31.133 --> 01:04:33.761
The problem
is in the general manager's office...

01:04:33.969 --> 01:04:34.993
...with Billy Beane.

01:04:35.204 --> 01:04:37.764
The root of the problem for me
is philosophical.

01:04:37.973 --> 01:04:40.168
I said it before.
This is fantasy baseball.

01:04:40.709 --> 01:04:42.142
Billy is just not thinking.

01:04:42.344 --> 01:04:44.904
Start thinking about a new GM,
making changes.

01:04:45.114 --> 01:04:46.513
He never goes to the games.

01:04:46.715 --> 01:04:51.084
- This was very predictable.
- He needs to look at what's going on.

01:04:51.286 --> 01:04:54.722
- The man needs to get real.
- I want Billy Beane gone.

01:04:54.923 --> 01:04:57.357
Calling for Beane's head.
I want your thoughts.

01:04:57.559 --> 01:05:02.724
The past 18 games, they've been
shut out or scored one run four times.

01:05:02.931 --> 01:05:04.592
They're just not scoring enough.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.928
It's not just the offense,
not Thad Bosley and the hitters.

01:05:08.137 --> 01:05:12.403
It's everything. If there was one thing
you could pick out, you'd try to fix it...

01:05:12.608 --> 01:05:17.910
...but just everything is in a funk
right now.

01:05:22.551 --> 01:05:25.076
What the hell am I doing?

01:05:27.489 --> 01:05:30.219
Oh, man.

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:32.394
Look, Steve.

01:05:35.964 --> 01:05:38.057
I believe in what we're doing.

01:05:38.267 --> 01:05:41.100
The record doesn't reflect the strength
of this team...

01:05:41.303 --> 01:05:43.965
...or where we're gonna be
at the end of the season.

01:05:44.173 --> 01:05:48.769
Now, Pete and I here feel very strongly
that we stay on the track we've chosen.

01:05:48.977 --> 01:05:51.468
Our sample size has been too small.
It's too...

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.307
Early. It's still early.

01:05:54.016 --> 01:05:57.076
Where do we expect to be
by the All-Star break?

01:05:58.287 --> 01:06:00.755
Our goal and our expectation...

01:06:00.956 --> 01:06:04.687
...is by mid-July
to be within seven games of first.

01:06:04.893 --> 01:06:06.292
That would be this working.

01:06:06.495 --> 01:06:08.963
- That keeps us in the hunt.
- Exceptionally well.

01:06:09.565 --> 01:06:12.398
- By July.
- July.

01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:16.435
And what's gonna prevent you
from accomplishing that?

01:06:16.638 --> 01:06:18.265
What are you afraid of?

01:06:18.474 --> 01:06:21.341
Nothing.
That's why we're here, Steve.

01:06:21.543 --> 01:06:24.842
That's why we get up in the morning.
That's all we do.

01:06:44.466 --> 01:06:45.956
- More?
- Yeah, a little more.

01:06:46.168 --> 01:06:49.604
- Don't tell your mother.
- I won't.

01:06:50.372 --> 01:06:52.465
- Chocolate sauce?
- Yes.

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:54.707
Stop.

01:06:57.346 --> 01:07:00.281
- Big spoon or little spoon?
- Little spoon.

01:07:01.683 --> 01:07:03.310
Thank you.

01:07:13.028 --> 01:07:16.122
Dad, there's no way
you're gonna lose your job, right?

01:07:16.331 --> 01:07:17.730
What?

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:21.967
- Well, I don't know. I'm just wondering.
- Where'd you hear that?

01:07:22.170 --> 01:07:24.104
Well, I go on the Internet sometimes.

01:07:24.306 --> 01:07:27.400
Well, don't do that.
Don't go on the Internet.

01:07:27.609 --> 01:07:30.442
Or watch TV or read newspapers...

01:07:31.246 --> 01:07:33.146
...or talk to people.

01:07:33.348 --> 01:07:35.976
I don't talk to people.
I just read stuff.

01:07:36.184 --> 01:07:38.778
Honey, everything's fine.
Everything's fine.

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:41.386
Really, you don't have to worry.

01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:44.923
But if you lose your job,
will you have to move away?

01:07:45.727 --> 01:07:48.127
Honey, I'm not gonna lose my job.

01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:51.533
You don't have to worry.

01:07:53.936 --> 01:07:56.268
- Okay.
- Hey.

01:07:56.905 --> 01:08:00.238
- There's no problem.
- Okay.

01:08:00.442 --> 01:08:03.741
All right? I got uptown problems,
which are not problems at all.

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:06.111
You're not worried, right?

01:08:06.315 --> 01:08:08.806
- No, I'm not worried.
- Okay.

01:08:16.124 --> 01:08:17.751
Peña.

01:08:20.462 --> 01:08:22.054
Okay.

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:37.002
I want Dye in right...

01:08:37.212 --> 01:08:40.010
...Justice DH'ing,
Peña on the bench...

01:08:40.215 --> 01:08:41.944
...Hatteberg at first...

01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:45.176
...and anyone but Mags
first out of the pen.

01:08:45.386 --> 01:08:47.252
You want Peña on the bench?

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:50.550
That's right. So you can play Hattie.

01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:52.953
Peña is not only
the best first baseman...

01:08:53.161 --> 01:08:55.287
...he's the only first baseman.

01:08:55.497 --> 01:08:57.863
Hattie gets on base more than Peña.

01:08:58.066 --> 01:09:00.500
- In fact, 20 percent more.
- And his fielding?

01:09:00.702 --> 01:09:03.363
His fielding does not matter.

01:09:04.406 --> 01:09:06.600
- I've heard enough of this.
- Have you?

01:09:06.808 --> 01:09:08.366
And I...

01:09:09.243 --> 01:09:12.179
I disagree with you,
plain and simple.

01:09:13.148 --> 01:09:15.274
And moreover,
I'm playing my team...

01:09:15.817 --> 01:09:19.446
...in a way that I can explain
in job interviews next winter.

01:09:20.421 --> 01:09:22.049
Okay?

01:09:27.062 --> 01:09:30.031
Hattie. Not Peña.

01:09:34.435 --> 01:09:35.767
What's up, skip?

01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:38.371
- How you doing?
- Good, how you doing, man?

01:09:38.573 --> 01:09:40.165
Get some sleep last night?

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:45.404
As the A's hit the field,
we are ready for baseball.

01:09:45.613 --> 01:09:48.912
First one out of the dugout
is rookie sensation Carlos Peña...

01:09:49.117 --> 01:09:54.020
...one of the few bright lights in this
lineup, taking his spot at first base.

01:10:33.795 --> 01:10:37.356
Billy, quick question. Do you expect
these guys to produce more or...?

01:10:37.566 --> 01:10:39.830
- Not now.
- What's the reason for the slump?

01:10:58.153 --> 01:10:59.677
Get down.

01:11:03.892 --> 01:11:05.826
Is losing fun?

01:11:09.064 --> 01:11:12.124
- Is losing fun?
- No.

01:11:16.304 --> 01:11:18.465
What are you having fun for?

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:46.298
That's what losing sounds like.

01:12:00.882 --> 01:12:02.281
Are you okay, Dad?

01:12:03.084 --> 01:12:04.984
- You're doing it again.
- What?

01:12:05.187 --> 01:12:07.451
You're worrying about me.

01:12:07.689 --> 01:12:09.486
You're in last place, Dad.

01:12:09.691 --> 01:12:12.057
- Do I look worried?
- Yeah.

01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:16.162
Because you're getting on an airplane,
and those things crash all the time.

01:12:16.364 --> 01:12:18.764
Please stop worrying
about your dad.

01:12:21.069 --> 01:12:22.661
- We're all set.
- Okay.

01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:26.734
- I love you.
- Love you too.

01:12:27.209 --> 01:12:30.076
All right. Your dad's not in trouble.

01:12:31.146 --> 01:12:33.080
Okay.

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.783
Yeah.

01:13:19.828 --> 01:13:21.921
- Suzanne, get me Ed Wade.
- Okay.

01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:23.825
- Coffee on?
- Yes.

01:13:24.032 --> 01:13:26.626
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Billy.

01:13:30.238 --> 01:13:32.035
Oh, hi, Louisa.

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:35.107
- I need Ed Wade for Billy Beane.
- Hi.

01:13:36.344 --> 01:13:37.333
Please hold.

01:13:37.545 --> 01:13:40.105
- What's up?
- Wade's on 2.

01:13:40.315 --> 01:13:41.748
- Ed?
- Hello?

01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:44.350
- Ed, it's Billy.
- Billy, what's up?

01:13:44.552 --> 01:13:47.521
- Look, I need a little help on defense.
- Okay.

01:13:47.722 --> 01:13:50.247
I'm willing to trade Jeremy Giambi
for it.

01:13:51.026 --> 01:13:52.425
- Really?
- What?

01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:54.727
- Who you got?
- What?

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:58.058
- Well, let me think.
- What are you doing?

01:13:58.266 --> 01:13:59.460
Cleaning house.

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:01.602
- Mabry?
- Maybe what?

01:14:01.803 --> 01:14:04.795
- No, Mabry.
- Hold on.

01:14:05.006 --> 01:14:06.837
- No.
- Why not?

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:09.135
Because you can't trade
Jeremy Giambi.

01:14:10.445 --> 01:14:11.912
He'll be fine, Ed.

01:14:12.113 --> 01:14:14.673
Why do I get the feeling
you're picking my pocket?

01:14:14.883 --> 01:14:18.182
I'm not. You're picking mine.
Giambi's name alone is worth more.

01:14:18.386 --> 01:14:20.547
- What's wrong with him?
- Nothing.

01:14:20.755 --> 01:14:24.213
Can we say it's done in theory
and start drawing up the paperwork?

01:14:24.426 --> 01:14:26.621
- Okay, but you're gonna have...
- Great.

01:14:26.828 --> 01:14:28.489
He was gonna say something else.

01:14:28.697 --> 01:14:31.257
When you get the answer
you're looking for, hang up.

01:14:31.466 --> 01:14:32.455
- Suzanne.
- Yes?

01:14:32.667 --> 01:14:35.101
- David Dombrowski.
- Okay.

01:14:35.303 --> 01:14:38.238
- And Peña's going too.
- I don't think you should do that.

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:42.877
- I really don't think you should do that.
- I want Hatteberg in the lineup tonight.

01:14:43.078 --> 01:14:44.409
You need to take a minute.

01:14:44.612 --> 01:14:47.706
I think you seriously need to think
about what you're doing.

01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:50.350
- Because you're upset.
- Okay.

01:14:50.885 --> 01:14:52.682
What am I missing?

01:14:53.421 --> 01:14:55.719
These are hard moves
to explain to people.

01:14:56.624 --> 01:14:58.216
Why is that a problem, Pete?

01:15:01.029 --> 01:15:03.224
Don't make
an emotional decision, Billy.

01:15:03.431 --> 01:15:07.765
- David Dombrowski's on 3.
- Look, we're gonna shake things up.

01:15:07.969 --> 01:15:10.961
Dave. Peña's going on the block.
You're my first call.

01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:14.771
Because he's making the rest
of the team look bad.

01:15:15.744 --> 01:15:17.575
He's gonna be a Rookie of the Year.

01:15:17.779 --> 01:15:20.873
- Probably an All-Star.
- He's an All-Star, Dave.

01:15:21.816 --> 01:15:24.546
No. I want a reliever and cash.

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:28.749
Okay. You got five minutes, Dave.
I'm not waiting.

01:15:29.491 --> 01:15:33.257
Billy, Peña is an All-Star, okay?

01:15:33.461 --> 01:15:37.454
And if you dump him and this
Hatteberg thing doesn't work out...

01:15:37.665 --> 01:15:39.326
...you know this is...

01:15:39.534 --> 01:15:42.594
This is the kind of decision
that gets you fired.

01:15:42.804 --> 01:15:44.328
It is.

01:15:44.906 --> 01:15:46.931
Yes, you're right.

01:15:47.409 --> 01:15:49.673
I may lose my job.

01:15:49.878 --> 01:15:53.245
In which case I'm a 44-year-old guy
with a high school diploma...

01:15:53.448 --> 01:15:56.713
...and a daughter
I'd like to be able to send to college.

01:15:57.252 --> 01:16:00.278
You're 25 years old,
with a degree from Yale...

01:16:00.488 --> 01:16:03.013
...and a pretty impressive
apprenticeship.

01:16:03.892 --> 01:16:06.622
I don't think
we're asking the right question.

01:16:07.128 --> 01:16:10.097
I think the question
we should be asking is...

01:16:10.298 --> 01:16:12.926
...do you believe in this thing or not?

01:16:14.836 --> 01:16:16.360
I do.

01:16:19.441 --> 01:16:22.467
It's a problem you think
we need to explain ourselves.

01:16:22.677 --> 01:16:25.840
Don't. To anyone.

01:16:29.250 --> 01:16:30.683
Okay.

01:16:33.254 --> 01:16:36.690
Now, I'm gonna see this thing through,
for better or worse.

01:16:40.161 --> 01:16:44.962
Just tell me, do you project we'll win
more with Hatteberg or Peña at first?

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:48.000
It's close...

01:16:48.837 --> 01:16:51.237
...but theoretically, Hatteberg.

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:57.100
- What are we talking about, then?
- Dombrowski's on again, on 3.

01:16:59.481 --> 01:17:00.880
Yeah?

01:17:01.616 --> 01:17:03.481
Okay, that'll work.

01:17:04.185 --> 01:17:06.415
Great. I need one more thing.

01:17:06.621 --> 01:17:09.818
Soda. Yeah, I don't want my guys
paying for soda.

01:17:10.024 --> 01:17:12.686
I want you to stock my machine
for three years.

01:17:12.894 --> 01:17:14.327
I'm serious.

01:17:15.396 --> 01:17:17.364
Great. It's a deal.

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.434
Go tell Peña he's gotta pack.

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:25.133
- You want me to tell Peña?
- Part of the job.

01:17:27.675 --> 01:17:30.075
What about Giambi?
You want me to tell him too?

01:17:30.278 --> 01:17:32.212
I'll tell him.

01:17:39.187 --> 01:17:40.745
- Excuse me, Carlos?
- Yeah?

01:17:40.955 --> 01:17:42.889
- Can I speak with you a minute?
- Yeah.

01:17:51.666 --> 01:17:54.226
Carlos, you've been traded
to the Tigers.

01:17:57.739 --> 01:17:59.707
This is Jay Palmer's number.

01:17:59.908 --> 01:18:02.433
He's the traveling secretary
for the team.

01:18:02.644 --> 01:18:05.636
He's expecting your call.
He'll take care of everything.

01:18:14.956 --> 01:18:17.390
- Is that it?
- Yes.

01:18:24.732 --> 01:18:26.131
Okay.

01:18:38.513 --> 01:18:39.946
Okay.

01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:43.710
Art, you got a minute?

01:18:47.021 --> 01:18:50.013
Yeah. Take a seat.

01:18:53.494 --> 01:18:57.760
You can't start Peña at first tonight.
You'll have to start Hatteberg.

01:18:58.666 --> 01:19:03.603
I don't wanna go 15 rounds, Billy.
The lineup card is mine, and that's all.

01:19:03.805 --> 01:19:05.796
That lineup card is definitely yours.

01:19:06.007 --> 01:19:08.532
I'm just saying you can't start Peña
at first.

01:19:11.679 --> 01:19:13.772
Well, I am starting him at first.

01:19:13.982 --> 01:19:17.918
I don't think so.
He plays for Detroit now.

01:19:21.889 --> 01:19:24.016
You traded Peña?

01:19:25.226 --> 01:19:26.716
Yeah.

01:19:26.928 --> 01:19:31.331
And Menechino, Hiljus, Tam
are all being sent down.

01:19:31.532 --> 01:19:35.764
- You are outside your mind.
- Yeah. Cuckoo.

01:19:37.605 --> 01:19:40.369
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah, Jeremy, grab a seat.

01:19:43.978 --> 01:19:46.446
Jeremy, you've been traded
to the Phillies.

01:19:46.648 --> 01:19:49.242
This is Ed Wade's number.
He's a good guy, the GM.

01:19:49.450 --> 01:19:51.748
He's expecting your call.

01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:54.751
Buddy will help you
with the plane flight.

01:19:56.124 --> 01:19:58.786
You're a good ballplayer, Jeremy...

01:19:58.993 --> 01:20:01.484
...and we wish you the best.

01:20:18.046 --> 01:20:20.105
Jeremy's gone too.

01:20:22.116 --> 01:20:24.175
You're killing this team.

01:20:24.385 --> 01:20:28.048
Art, I can do this all day long.

01:20:34.195 --> 01:20:35.526
Hey.

01:20:36.531 --> 01:20:38.556
You agree with this?

01:20:39.967 --> 01:20:41.628
Hundred percent.

01:20:43.204 --> 01:20:44.728
You want this door closed?

01:20:57.318 --> 01:20:59.752
- Scotty H.
- Sir?

01:21:00.788 --> 01:21:04.417
- Go field some grounders.
- Yes, sir.

01:21:04.625 --> 01:21:06.388
Everybody, listen up.

01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:12.160
You may not look
like a winning team...

01:21:15.436 --> 01:21:17.495
...but you are one.

01:21:24.846 --> 01:21:26.837
So play like one tonight.

01:21:35.523 --> 01:21:37.684
Oh, shit.

01:21:40.795 --> 01:21:43.958
When you're getting your pitch,
you're hitting .625, massive.

01:21:44.165 --> 01:21:45.962
You're crushing the ball.

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:49.000
But when you swing at things...
Your pitch is middle-in.

01:21:49.203 --> 01:21:52.036
When you're swinging low and away,
you're batting .158.

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.265
Every at bat's
like a hand of blackjack.

01:21:54.475 --> 01:21:56.773
Every card that's dealt,
your odds change.

01:21:56.978 --> 01:22:01.278
So every first-pitch strike, your batting
average goes down about 75 points.

01:22:01.482 --> 01:22:02.608
Seventy-five points.

01:22:02.817 --> 01:22:05.047
He should throw 100 pitches
before the fifth.

01:22:05.253 --> 01:22:06.982
You wanna knock that starter out.

01:22:07.188 --> 01:22:10.646
I want you taking at bats off the 10th
and 11 th pitcher by the end.

01:22:10.858 --> 01:22:13.224
This is your basic breakdown
of the pitches...

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:15.589
...where you should be hitting them,
why.

01:22:15.797 --> 01:22:19.324
- So you want us to walk more?
- Good question. Yes.

01:22:20.768 --> 01:22:22.793
Mr. Justice.

01:22:23.004 --> 01:22:24.938
- Had a few thoughts.
- Yeah?

01:22:25.139 --> 01:22:27.471
- Yeah.
- Gonna teach me some things?

01:22:27.975 --> 01:22:29.636
Excuse me?

01:22:31.245 --> 01:22:33.475
Never seen a GM talk to players
like that.

01:22:33.681 --> 01:22:36.343
You never seen a GM
who was a player.

01:22:42.657 --> 01:22:45.421
- We got a problem, David?
- No, it's okay.

01:22:45.626 --> 01:22:47.787
I know your routine.

01:22:47.995 --> 01:22:51.226
It's patter. It's for effect.

01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:56.663
But it's for them, all right?
That shit ain't for me.

01:22:57.238 --> 01:22:58.933
Oh, you're special?

01:23:01.409 --> 01:23:05.971
You're paying me 7 million bucks
a year, man, so, yeah...

01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:08.478
...maybe I am, a little bit.

01:23:08.683 --> 01:23:11.618
No, man, I ain't paying you 7.

01:23:12.353 --> 01:23:14.218
Yankees are paying half your salary.

01:23:14.422 --> 01:23:17.186
That's what the New York Yankees
think of you.

01:23:18.092 --> 01:23:22.358
They're paying you $3.5 million
to play against them.

01:23:23.698 --> 01:23:25.825
Where you going with this, Billy?

01:23:26.667 --> 01:23:28.965
David, you're 37.

01:23:29.170 --> 01:23:32.901
How about you and I be honest about
what each of us want out of this?

01:23:34.542 --> 01:23:37.875
I wanna milk the last ounce of baseball
you got in you.

01:23:38.079 --> 01:23:40.343
And you wanna stay in the show.

01:23:40.948 --> 01:23:42.848
Let's do that.

01:23:43.784 --> 01:23:46.309
I'm not paying you
for the player you used to be.

01:23:46.521 --> 01:23:49.490
I'm paying you for the player you are
right now.

01:23:49.690 --> 01:23:53.091
You're smart.
You get what we're trying to do here.

01:23:53.294 --> 01:23:56.058
Make an example
for the younger guys.

01:23:56.264 --> 01:23:58.027
Be a leader.

01:23:58.733 --> 01:24:00.360
Can you do that?

01:24:07.508 --> 01:24:10.409
All right. I got you.

01:24:12.914 --> 01:24:14.609
We're cool?

01:24:16.717 --> 01:24:18.150
We're cool.

01:24:23.457 --> 01:24:24.651
Scotty H.

01:24:24.859 --> 01:24:27.657
- Yo, what's up, D.J.?
- Picking machine.

01:24:28.162 --> 01:24:30.528
How you liking first base, man?

01:24:31.866 --> 01:24:35.029
It's coming along. Picking it up.

01:24:35.236 --> 01:24:39.332
You know, tough transition,
but I'm starting to feel better with it.

01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:41.531
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:24:41.742 --> 01:24:43.607
What's your biggest fear?

01:24:44.278 --> 01:24:46.940
A baseball being hit
in my general direction.

01:24:49.083 --> 01:24:52.177
That's funny. Seriously, what is it?

01:24:55.656 --> 01:24:57.954
No, seriously, that is.

01:25:08.769 --> 01:25:11.067
Well, hey, good luck with that.

01:25:11.272 --> 01:25:13.399
Be social out there.

01:25:14.342 --> 01:25:16.867
- Social.
- Social. Like a greeter at the Gap.

01:25:17.078 --> 01:25:19.103
Guy steps into your office,
chat him up.

01:25:19.313 --> 01:25:21.941
You're well-read.
You went to school.

01:25:22.149 --> 01:25:24.276
- Yeah.
- Have some fun. Relax.

01:25:24.485 --> 01:25:27.352
Everyone wants to attack.
Quit trying to attack.

01:25:27.555 --> 01:25:30.752
Let the game come to you, man.
There's no clock on this thing.

01:25:30.958 --> 01:25:32.357
This is a war of attrition.

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:36.929
If I take more, I could even take
a few strikes, but I'll get walked more.

01:25:37.131 --> 01:25:40.862
You get on base, we win.
You don't, we lose.

01:25:41.068 --> 01:25:44.367
And I hate losing, Chavvie. I hate it.

01:25:44.572 --> 01:25:47.097
I hate losing
more than I even wanna win.

01:25:47.308 --> 01:25:48.605
And there's a difference.

01:25:48.809 --> 01:25:50.276
- No bunts.
- Bunts is an out.

01:25:50.478 --> 01:25:53.709
- Even if the third baseman is back?
- No bunting whatsoever.

01:25:53.914 --> 01:25:56.610
If someone bunts on us,
throw it to first.

01:25:56.817 --> 01:25:58.512
Don't be a hero and go to second.

01:25:58.719 --> 01:26:00.118
Let them make the mistakes.

01:26:00.321 --> 01:26:03.222
When your enemy's making mistakes,
don't interrupt them.

01:26:03.424 --> 01:26:05.915
They're giving you an out.
Just giving it to you.

01:26:06.127 --> 01:26:07.355
Take it. Say thank you.

01:26:07.561 --> 01:26:09.529
Another thing. No more stealing.

01:26:09.730 --> 01:26:11.755
That's what I do,
what you pay me to do.

01:26:11.966 --> 01:26:14.867
I pay you to get on first,
not get thrown out at second.

01:26:15.069 --> 01:26:20.006
This is a process.
It's a process, it's a process. Okay?

01:26:32.386 --> 01:26:36.220
Jason takes it, goes to second
for the only out, and the A's get a run.

01:26:37.892 --> 01:26:41.953
Jermaine Dye homers again,
his second in two games.

01:26:43.497 --> 01:26:46.591
And the A's are still hanging in.
We'll get you scores here.

01:26:46.801 --> 01:26:51.204
The A's pull within two
of the Angels for the wild-card chase.

01:26:51.405 --> 01:26:53.532
The Reds have now dropped
five in a row...

01:26:53.741 --> 01:26:57.108
...as Oakland beats them
in the beginning of this series 5 to 3.

01:26:57.311 --> 01:26:58.608
Tejada walks.

01:26:58.813 --> 01:27:00.110
Ball four.

01:27:00.314 --> 01:27:03.147
Ball four and Hatteberg walks.

01:27:04.719 --> 01:27:08.177
What is happening in Oakland?
The A's have won seven in a row.

01:27:08.389 --> 01:27:10.584
A lot of excitement.
What a winning streak.

01:27:10.791 --> 01:27:13.589
But how about the calming influence
of Art Howe?

01:27:13.794 --> 01:27:17.389
When you say "your source,"
if it's not me or Peter, they don't know.

01:27:17.598 --> 01:27:19.259
He's managing
an unorthodox team.

01:27:19.467 --> 01:27:21.230
- Right.
- It's not a perfect roster.

01:27:21.435 --> 01:27:24.700
But right now, Art Howe is the reason
this team is winning.

01:27:24.905 --> 01:27:27.465
- He deserves the credit.
- Great, thanks. Bye.

01:27:27.675 --> 01:27:29.165
Did you hear that?

01:27:29.376 --> 01:27:32.311
I heard "seven in a row."
You get the Cleveland matchups?

01:27:32.513 --> 01:27:34.378
Yeah, right here.

01:27:42.156 --> 01:27:43.589
- Voos.
- Billy.

01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:47.022
- That smell is getting worse.
- I'm on it.

01:27:47.795 --> 01:27:49.922
- What are we doing?
- Splitting it in half?

01:27:50.131 --> 01:27:51.928
- Both sides of the plate.
- Got it.

01:27:52.666 --> 01:27:54.827
- Huddy. Mix it up.
- Yes, sir.

01:27:55.035 --> 01:27:57.128
- Trust your slider, yeah?
- Yes, sir.

01:27:57.338 --> 01:27:59.306
You guys quit distracting him.

01:27:59.507 --> 01:28:02.203
You couldn't hit that shit last night
with a paddle.

01:28:02.409 --> 01:28:04.206
You gotta see more pitches.

01:28:04.411 --> 01:28:06.879
- All right, Billy.
- Patience.

01:28:10.718 --> 01:28:12.276
- Hey, David.
- Hey, Billy.

01:28:12.486 --> 01:28:13.817
- Great at bats.
- Thank you.

01:28:14.021 --> 01:28:15.545
- Really quality.
- Thank you.

01:28:15.756 --> 01:28:18.418
Base hit to right field.
Tejada scores.

01:28:18.626 --> 01:28:21.459
Chavez coming in.
The ball gets past Guiel.

01:28:22.429 --> 01:28:26.490
The A's, from 5-nothing down,
now lead 6 to 5.

01:28:36.544 --> 01:28:39.513
The Oakland A's are completely
out of hand at the moment.

01:28:39.713 --> 01:28:42.341
They are an AL-best 17 and 4
this month.

01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:46.316
They also took back-to-back series
at Boston and at New York.

01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:49.114
Remember when they traded
Jeremy Giambi in June...

01:28:49.323 --> 01:28:51.621
...and everyone thought
they'd just given up?

01:28:51.826 --> 01:28:54.454
Actually, not so much.

01:28:59.266 --> 01:29:01.029
Suzanne, get Shapiro on the phone.

01:29:01.602 --> 01:29:04.730
- You thinking Rincon?
- His season's done. He's lost faith.

01:29:04.939 --> 01:29:07.908
- I think he's gonna dump him.
- Hard-core.

01:29:08.108 --> 01:29:10.338
Shapiro on 2.

01:29:11.946 --> 01:29:13.675
Mark, Billy. Let's be honest.

01:29:13.881 --> 01:29:17.214
A premier setup man isn't
gonna get you closer to the play-offs.

01:29:17.418 --> 01:29:21.479
- Are you referring to Rincon?
- He's a luxury you can't afford, man.

01:29:21.689 --> 01:29:24.351
And you can?
There's half a million on his contract.

01:29:24.558 --> 01:29:26.583
And we've got
at least one other suitor.

01:29:26.794 --> 01:29:29.456
By "at least one," you mean one.

01:29:29.663 --> 01:29:32.097
- Who is it?
- I'd rather not say.

01:29:32.299 --> 01:29:34.563
- San Francisco.
- San Francisco.

01:29:34.768 --> 01:29:36.235
I'll call you back.

01:29:38.072 --> 01:29:40.199
What do you think we can get
for Magnante?

01:29:40.407 --> 01:29:41.635
Nothing.

01:29:42.576 --> 01:29:45.602
- What's left on Venafro's contract?
- Two seventy-five.

01:29:46.447 --> 01:29:48.210
Suzanne,
get me Sabean on the line.

01:29:48.415 --> 01:29:52.476
Get the Giants interested in Venafro,
Mark's only got one buyer for Rincon.

01:29:52.686 --> 01:29:54.085
- Us.
- On 3.

01:29:56.190 --> 01:29:59.626
Saby-Sabster, it's Billy.
What do you think of Venafro?

01:29:59.827 --> 01:30:01.954
I can let you have him
for almost nothing.

01:30:02.162 --> 01:30:04.687
- Why would you do that?
- Because I'm amazing.

01:30:04.899 --> 01:30:06.867
I want a couple bucks
and a sweetener.

01:30:07.334 --> 01:30:09.131
Throw in, say...

01:30:09.336 --> 01:30:11.463
- Anderson.
- Anderson.

01:30:11.672 --> 01:30:14.573
- I like Anderson.
- No, you don't. Nobody likes him.

01:30:14.775 --> 01:30:17.266
I don't know why I'm doing this.
But let's do it.

01:30:17.478 --> 01:30:20.379
Venafro for Michaelson. Anderson.
I don't know his name.

01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:23.414
- I'll think about it.
- Think about it and call me back.

01:30:24.018 --> 01:30:25.986
Get Shapiro on.

01:30:33.928 --> 01:30:36.123
Shapiro's on 2.

01:30:38.232 --> 01:30:40.166
- Mark.
- You can't afford him, Billy.

01:30:40.367 --> 01:30:41.391
You sure about that?

01:30:41.602 --> 01:30:44.765
I get the impression
the market for Rincon is softening.

01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:47.736
I could be wrong,
but I'd call whoever's interested...

01:30:47.942 --> 01:30:51.400
...and see if they're still interested.
Call me back.

01:30:52.313 --> 01:30:55.680
- What about the Mets for Venafro?
- You offered him to the Giants.

01:30:55.883 --> 01:30:57.510
Suzanne, Steve Phillips.

01:30:57.718 --> 01:31:02.485
Between Bonds, Kent, Nen, Snow,
San Francisco's never gonna do it.

01:31:02.957 --> 01:31:06.654
- Totally agree.
- We just need them to cool on Rincon.

01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:09.954
- Phillips on 2.
- Steve-o, it's Billy.

01:31:10.164 --> 01:31:13.827
I hear you're looking for a reliever.
I can give you Venafro.

01:31:14.034 --> 01:31:16.525
- I can make it quick and easy.
- What's the angle?

01:31:16.737 --> 01:31:19.706
- No angle.
- Who am I getting fleeced for?

01:31:20.374 --> 01:31:23.741
- Hang on a sec.
- Bennett, maybe?

01:31:23.944 --> 01:31:25.275
- How old?
- Twenty-six.

01:31:25.479 --> 01:31:27.538
Twenty-six, Double-A? Forget it.

01:31:27.748 --> 01:31:29.773
Duncan, no.

01:31:31.618 --> 01:31:33.313
No. Furbush, no.

01:31:36.023 --> 01:31:39.686
Eckerton? Eckerton? Eckerton.

01:31:40.861 --> 01:31:42.795
- Eckerton.
- Eckerton? I like Eckerton.

01:31:42.997 --> 01:31:46.228
- You don't even know who Eckerton is.
- Is Venafro hurt?

01:31:46.433 --> 01:31:49.698
No, he's fine, he's fine.
It's just an issue for us.

01:31:49.903 --> 01:31:52.565
- Last couple times, he got hammered.
- Not his fault.

01:31:52.773 --> 01:31:54.900
- That was us. We misused him.
- It's Steve.

01:31:55.109 --> 01:31:57.077
- I'm almost done.
- Steve Schott.

01:31:57.511 --> 01:32:00.446
Look, Steve-o,
let me be straight with you.

01:32:00.647 --> 01:32:03.411
Here's the deal.
I'm getting Rincon. It's a done deal.

01:32:03.617 --> 01:32:06.643
- I heard the Giants...
- Giants want Venafro for Michaelson.

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:08.719
- Anderson.
- I'd rather deal with you.

01:32:08.922 --> 01:32:11.914
You can give me Eckerton
and $225,000 in cash...

01:32:12.126 --> 01:32:14.117
...and the Giants can't.

01:32:14.995 --> 01:32:16.986
- I'll think about it.
- Think about it.

01:32:17.197 --> 01:32:19.529
But whoever calls me back first
gets Venafro.

01:32:22.002 --> 01:32:23.162
Schott hung up.

01:32:24.671 --> 01:32:27.936
Oh, I want this one.

01:32:35.949 --> 01:32:38.247
Why isn't anybody calling?

01:32:41.088 --> 01:32:43.283
Shapiro's on 2.

01:32:44.691 --> 01:32:46.056
Yeah?

01:32:50.264 --> 01:32:52.858
Okay, let me talk to my owner.
I'll call you back.

01:32:53.067 --> 01:32:55.729
- Get Steve on the phone.
- Schott or Phillips?

01:32:55.936 --> 01:32:58.769
Why would we call Phillips?
Phillips has gotta call us.

01:33:02.676 --> 01:33:04.371
Tell him I'm on the other line.

01:33:08.148 --> 01:33:11.777
Hi, Mr. Schott, it's Peter Brand.
I apologize for putting you on hold.

01:33:11.985 --> 01:33:16.752
- Billy asked me to call you back.
- Tell him we want 225,000 for Rincon.

01:33:16.957 --> 01:33:21.951
Billy says he needs $225,000
for Ricardo Rincon.

01:33:22.563 --> 01:33:24.121
Please.

01:33:25.699 --> 01:33:28.930
Yes, I added the "please" at the end.

01:33:30.337 --> 01:33:33.568
Okay. Let me...
Hold on one second, please.

01:33:34.408 --> 01:33:36.376
Tell him I'll pay for him.

01:33:36.577 --> 01:33:40.877
But when I sell him back for twice the
amount next year, I keep the money.

01:33:42.883 --> 01:33:45.852
Okay, so Billy says
he'll pay for Rincon himself.

01:33:46.053 --> 01:33:50.285
But when he sells him for more money
next year, he's keeping the profit.

01:34:00.267 --> 01:34:02.929
Thank you very much.
We'll call you back. Thank you.

01:34:03.137 --> 01:34:05.731
Come on. Come on.

01:34:10.911 --> 01:34:14.677
Suzanne, call Shapiro ba...
Never mind, I got him right here.

01:34:17.518 --> 01:34:19.281
Mark. Yeah.

01:34:19.486 --> 01:34:22.387
Listen, I don't want Rincon
pitching against me tonight.

01:34:22.589 --> 01:34:26.025
Tell him to change clothes and
send him over. I got you the money.

01:34:26.226 --> 01:34:27.625
Yup.

01:34:27.828 --> 01:34:29.227
Great.

01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:37.359
I don't wanna dampen the mood at all,
but since we picked up Rincon...

01:34:37.571 --> 01:34:39.801
We gotta send someone down.

01:34:46.547 --> 01:34:49.539
- Mags.
- Hey, Billy.

01:34:52.553 --> 01:34:54.384
I know I've been struggling lately.

01:34:54.588 --> 01:34:58.319
But second half of the season,
definitely turn it around. Ricky and I...

01:34:58.525 --> 01:35:02.427
Mike, I need you
to stop getting dressed.

01:35:04.998 --> 01:35:06.556
Traded?

01:35:17.444 --> 01:35:19.844
I'm sorry for the crap news.

01:35:20.647 --> 01:35:22.547
I know it hurts.

01:35:32.826 --> 01:35:35.590
Mike, I can't have 26 guys
in the clubhouse.

01:35:35.796 --> 01:35:38.731
I get it. I get it.

01:35:39.967 --> 01:35:43.164
Okay. Thanks.

01:35:57.451 --> 01:35:59.510
Hey, Ricardo.

01:36:00.954 --> 01:36:03.548
This must be a bit of a shock,
I guess.

01:36:04.191 --> 01:36:06.455
Mabry hits one
deep to right-center field.

01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:08.628
Racing back, Fick can't get it.

01:36:08.829 --> 01:36:12.424
It bounces to the wall.
One run is in. Two runs are in.

01:36:12.899 --> 01:36:16.164
Mabry, on one pitch,
has shot the A's in front.

01:36:17.571 --> 01:36:20.665
Strike three called.
Twelve straight wins for the Athletics.

01:36:20.874 --> 01:36:22.239
Man alive, was it hairy.

01:36:22.442 --> 01:36:24.808
Something strange is now happening
in Oakland.

01:36:25.012 --> 01:36:27.412
- You cannot argue that point.
- Twelve straight.

01:36:27.614 --> 01:36:30.481
They're making a joke
out of the American League.

01:36:30.684 --> 01:36:33.244
- They were in Detroit today...
- He throws to first.

01:36:33.453 --> 01:36:36.945
And that's the sound
of 14 straight victories.

01:36:37.157 --> 01:36:39.182
Fourteen, the longest run this year.

01:36:39.393 --> 01:36:42.021
It has slingshot the A's into first
in the AL West.

01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:44.424
- A nice streak.
- This team was written off.

01:36:44.631 --> 01:36:48.067
How do you explain, otherwise,
the victories they've come up with?

01:36:48.268 --> 01:36:51.760
The Oakland A's are gonna win
16 consecutive games.

01:36:52.839 --> 01:36:57.640
This is the longest win streak
in baseball, folks, in 25 years.

01:36:59.746 --> 01:37:03.614
- The A's have won 16 in a row.
- We're going to 20! We're going to 20!

01:37:03.817 --> 01:37:08.015
To have a winning streak of
this duration, you have to be good...

01:37:08.221 --> 01:37:11.122
...but there's an element
of randomness to it.

01:37:11.325 --> 01:37:13.486
The 1927 Yankees, Ruth, Gehrig...

01:37:13.694 --> 01:37:16.788
...Murderers' Row, some people
still say the best team ever.

01:37:16.997 --> 01:37:20.489
Longest winning streak
for them that year? Nine.

01:37:20.701 --> 01:37:23.670
You guys try to analyze it
from a numbers standpoint.

01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:27.897
I'm telling you, there is no explanation
for what's occurring right now.

01:37:28.108 --> 01:37:29.871
Do you have superstitions
going on?

01:37:30.077 --> 01:37:32.443
Do you do things
so you keep the streak alive?

01:37:32.646 --> 01:37:36.138
The all-time record of 20
does not seem impossible anymore.

01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:38.648
The A's were on page one
of the New York Times.

01:37:38.852 --> 01:37:42.185
They are the story in sports
in this entire country.

01:37:42.389 --> 01:37:43.720
Two-two pitch, here it is.

01:37:43.924 --> 01:37:47.587
Swing and a miss! Struck him out!
Number 17!

01:37:49.296 --> 01:37:51.093
It's taken 71 years.

01:37:51.298 --> 01:37:54.165
The Oakland A's
have tied the Philadelphia A's.

01:37:54.368 --> 01:37:58.236
The all-time franchise record
17 straight...

01:37:58.438 --> 01:38:03.671
...and baseball's longest
winning streak since 1953.

01:38:03.877 --> 01:38:07.779
The A's are two wins away from
tying the American League record.

01:38:07.981 --> 01:38:13.613
It's gone! It's gone!
Tejada wins it! Do you believe it?

01:38:14.121 --> 01:38:16.248
Eighteen wins in a row!

01:38:16.456 --> 01:38:19.357
You could replay these 18 games
a hundred times over.

01:38:19.559 --> 01:38:21.424
And nobody wins 18 straight again.

01:38:21.628 --> 01:38:24.153
It defies everything we know
about baseball.

01:38:25.732 --> 01:38:27.927
The most amazing thing
you could imagine...

01:38:28.135 --> 01:38:31.070
...happened over the last four days
at the Coliseum.

01:38:31.271 --> 01:38:36.800
Tejada, up the middle.
The A's have won 19 in a row!

01:38:37.744 --> 01:38:40.269
The 1906 White Sox...

01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:44.473
...the 1947 New York Yankees
have company.

01:38:45.752 --> 01:38:50.280
- Nineteen in a row.
- The A's have a date with destiny.

01:38:50.490 --> 01:38:53.516
They're going for the all-time
American League record...

01:38:53.727 --> 01:38:54.785
...20 games in a row.

01:38:54.995 --> 01:38:55.984
We're going to 20!

01:38:56.196 --> 01:38:59.256
We're gonna take the AL record
to 20, baby!

01:39:02.202 --> 01:39:03.999
Don't tell me the score, Pete.

01:39:04.204 --> 01:39:05.364
No, Billy, it's me.

01:39:05.572 --> 01:39:07.938
- Sharon?
- Yeah.

01:39:09.176 --> 01:39:12.304
- You have a second?
- Yeah, what's up?

01:39:12.512 --> 01:39:14.878
Well, I didn't actually expect you
to pick up.

01:39:15.081 --> 01:39:17.049
I was gonna leave a message.

01:39:17.918 --> 01:39:20.853
Casey and I, we're here
and watching the game at home.

01:39:21.054 --> 01:39:24.649
And I just wanted to say...

01:39:26.059 --> 01:39:27.754
...you did good, Billy.

01:39:27.961 --> 01:39:29.952
We're really proud of you.

01:39:31.498 --> 01:39:33.796
I appreciate it, Sharon.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.833
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

01:39:37.671 --> 01:39:38.660
Okay.

01:39:38.872 --> 01:39:41.170
Oh, Casey wants to talk to you.
Hang on.

01:39:42.008 --> 01:39:43.771
Are you on your way
to the stadium?

01:39:43.977 --> 01:39:46.969
No, I'm on my way to Visalia
to see our minor-league team.

01:39:47.180 --> 01:39:49.910
- Turn around, please, Dad.
- No way, Jose.

01:39:50.116 --> 01:39:52.778
- Turn around. Come on, Dad.
- Nope. Not gonna happen.

01:39:52.986 --> 01:39:54.283
You're not gonna jinx it.

01:39:54.488 --> 01:39:58.015
I'll talk to you later, sweetheart.
I love you.

01:40:04.564 --> 01:40:05.929
Shit.

01:40:06.132 --> 01:40:09.226
One out here in the fourth,
and if you're just joining us...

01:40:09.436 --> 01:40:10.460
...you missed a lot.

01:40:10.670 --> 01:40:13.662
And the pitch to Raúl Ibañez.
Strike one.

01:40:13.874 --> 01:40:15.535
I think my recap will be simple.

01:40:15.742 --> 01:40:19.371
The A's scored six in the first,
one in the second, four in the third.

01:40:19.579 --> 01:40:22.776
And people would be shocked
if you just did that.

01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:25.545
Eleven to nothing, the A's do lead.

01:40:25.752 --> 01:40:28.448
- Shit.
- Foul off the foot of Ibañez...

01:40:50.944 --> 01:40:53.538
Let's go, Oakland!

01:40:53.747 --> 01:40:56.272
Let's go, Oakland!

01:40:56.483 --> 01:40:59.043
Let's go, Oakland!

01:41:04.524 --> 01:41:10.588
Now batting, number 2,
catcher, Brent Mayne.

01:41:14.768 --> 01:41:18.704
- Oakland!
- Here we go, Oakland!

01:41:27.314 --> 01:41:28.872
Two.

01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:32.177
Safe.

01:41:37.557 --> 01:41:40.492
Now batting, number 18...

01:41:40.694 --> 01:41:44.824
...left fielder RaúI Ibañez.

01:42:46.026 --> 01:42:47.584
Safe.

01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:52.396
And the A's now lead by a score
of 11 to 3.

01:42:52.599 --> 01:42:55.363
A nice cushion,
but you don't wanna give teams life...

01:42:55.568 --> 01:42:59.470
...and let them wedge their way
back in, even when you're...

01:43:42.248 --> 01:43:43.943
Nobody out, the bases loaded.

01:43:44.150 --> 01:43:47.449
And Art Howe on the way to the
mound to make a pitching change.

01:43:47.654 --> 01:43:49.519
And this game is still in a state...

01:43:49.723 --> 01:43:52.590
...where it could get out of control
for the Athletics.

01:43:59.332 --> 01:44:02.529
We're all told at some point we can
no longer play the children's game.

01:44:02.736 --> 01:44:06.297
We just don't know
when that's gonna be.

01:44:09.909 --> 01:44:15.347
Some of us are told at 18, some of us
are told at 40, but we're all told.

01:44:15.548 --> 01:44:17.846
Mike Sweeney with runners
at first and third.

01:44:18.051 --> 01:44:20.417
It's an 11-to-7 game,
the A's in front.

01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:23.316
Tam peering in for the sign.

01:44:23.523 --> 01:44:26.458
Two out. Runners at first and third.

01:44:26.659 --> 01:44:29.093
And the 3-2 delivery.

01:45:02.896 --> 01:45:05.160
It's weird, Billy.

01:45:05.365 --> 01:45:09.392
You wanna give up baseball
to become a scout?

01:45:10.770 --> 01:45:13.136
I'm not a baseball player.

01:45:13.606 --> 01:45:16.006
Are you sure this is what you want?

01:45:17.410 --> 01:45:21.938
The crowd is roaring.
Koch is ready. One-two pitch.

01:45:22.448 --> 01:45:25.679
Alicea puts it in play,
a looper to left field for a base hit.

01:45:25.885 --> 01:45:29.286
Around third, tearing for the plate,
here comes the tying run.

01:45:29.522 --> 01:45:33.481
Sliding safe.
And the ball game is tied at 11-all.

01:45:33.693 --> 01:45:35.285
Holy Toledo.

01:45:36.629 --> 01:45:40.861
The A's have blown
an 11-to-nothing lead.

01:45:42.669 --> 01:45:46.730
This is the specter of a development
that has been lurking now...

01:45:47.207 --> 01:45:51.303
...ever since the five-run fourth inning
by the Royals.

01:45:51.511 --> 01:45:56.915
And the A's date with destiny
is on hold right now.

01:46:22.542 --> 01:46:25.773
Hatteberg. Hattie.

01:46:26.312 --> 01:46:28.746
Grab a bat.
You're hitting for Byrnesy.

01:46:30.283 --> 01:46:33.616
Come on, let's go.
Get yourself loose.

01:46:43.997 --> 01:46:47.831
Hitting for Eric Byrnes...

01:46:48.034 --> 01:46:52.164
...number 10, Scott Hatteberg.

01:47:00.346 --> 01:47:03.907
In your typical A's fashion,
they want a base runner here.

01:47:04.117 --> 01:47:07.814
Scott Hatteberg is so adept
at drawing walks.

01:47:11.057 --> 01:47:13.287
He's looking for Hatteberg
to get on base...

01:47:13.493 --> 01:47:15.461
...maybe bring in a pinch runner.

01:47:15.662 --> 01:47:18.062
Let's go, Oakland!

01:47:18.264 --> 01:47:20.289
Let's go, Oakland!

01:48:15.154 --> 01:48:16.917
That one is gone!

01:48:17.123 --> 01:48:21.560
And it's 20 consecutive victories
for the Oakland Athletics...

01:48:21.761 --> 01:48:23.752
...on an unbelievable night...

01:48:23.963 --> 01:48:26.591
...when they lost
an 11-to-nothing lead...

01:48:26.799 --> 01:48:29.131
...and now they win it.

01:48:30.503 --> 01:48:34.963
The crowd comes back
to insane life.

01:48:36.909 --> 01:48:38.877
How do you explain it?

01:48:39.879 --> 01:48:44.179
Crazy. Just plain crazy.

01:48:48.321 --> 01:48:51.848
Hatteberg is mobbed at home plate.

01:48:55.128 --> 01:48:58.063
In 103 years
of American League baseball...

01:48:58.264 --> 01:49:01.700
...the Athletics have accomplished
what no one has before.

01:49:01.901 --> 01:49:06.099
They have won
20 consecutive games.

01:49:32.131 --> 01:49:34.895
It's hard not to be romantic
about baseball.

01:49:36.803 --> 01:49:40.034
This kind of thing,
it's fun for the fans.

01:49:40.973 --> 01:49:44.374
It sells tickets and hot dogs.

01:49:45.711 --> 01:49:47.269
Doesn't mean anything.

01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:51.075
Billy, we just won 20 games
in a row.

01:49:52.852 --> 01:49:54.843
And what's the point?

01:49:55.054 --> 01:49:57.682
We just got the record.

01:50:00.626 --> 01:50:02.992
Man, I've been doing this for...

01:50:09.035 --> 01:50:11.060
Listen, man.

01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:14.706
I've been in this game a long time.

01:50:16.342 --> 01:50:19.072
I'm not in it for a record,
I'll tell you that.

01:50:19.278 --> 01:50:21.371
I'm not in it for a ring.

01:50:24.083 --> 01:50:26.278
That's when people get hurt.

01:50:27.954 --> 01:50:30.855
If we don't win the last game
of the Series...

01:50:32.125 --> 01:50:34.116
...they'll dismiss us.

01:50:34.727 --> 01:50:36.126
- Billy...
- I know these guys.

01:50:36.329 --> 01:50:39.196
I know the way they think,
and they will erase us.

01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:43.168
And everything we've done here...

01:50:43.369 --> 01:50:45.269
...none of it'll matter.

01:50:48.374 --> 01:50:51.673
Any other team wins the World Series,
good for them.

01:50:52.912 --> 01:50:56.211
They're drinking champagne,
they get a ring.

01:50:56.415 --> 01:50:58.315
But if we win...

01:50:58.951 --> 01:51:01.579
...on our budget, with this team...

01:51:05.391 --> 01:51:07.416
...we'll have changed the game.

01:51:08.261 --> 01:51:10.354
And that's what I want.

01:51:10.563 --> 01:51:12.793
I want it to mean something.

01:51:22.475 --> 01:51:25.569
The A's going to the play-offs
with the West Division title.

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:29.475
Forgive the A's
if they're not celebrating.

01:51:29.682 --> 01:51:31.172
They have been here before...

01:51:31.384 --> 01:51:35.081
...when Oakland went up two games
to none on the Yanks in the ALDS...

01:51:35.288 --> 01:51:37.756
...and went nowhere
after losing three straight.

01:51:37.957 --> 01:51:41.222
With a win today over the Twins,
Oakland moves into the ALCS...

01:51:41.427 --> 01:51:44.760
...for the first time since 1992.
- But remember one thing.

01:51:46.165 --> 01:51:49.965
Percentages hold up over a season,
but for one game, one at bat...

01:51:50.169 --> 01:51:52.660
...throw the percentages
out the window.

01:52:25.504 --> 01:52:29.998
What the Minnesota Twins exposed
is the fact that the Oakland A's...

01:52:30.209 --> 01:52:33.940
...were fundamentally
not a sound baseball team.

01:52:34.146 --> 01:52:37.604
They had a flawed concept that
started with the general manager...

01:52:37.817 --> 01:52:41.275
...and the brain trust
thinking they could reinvent baseball.

01:52:41.487 --> 01:52:43.045
You can't approach baseball...

01:52:43.256 --> 01:52:45.884
...from a statistical,
bean-counting point of view.

01:52:46.092 --> 01:52:48.322
It's won on the field
with fundamental play.

01:52:48.527 --> 01:52:51.553
You have to steal, you have to bunt,
you have to sacrifice.

01:52:51.764 --> 01:52:55.325
You gotta get men in scoring position,
and you gotta bring them in.

01:52:55.534 --> 01:52:59.937
And you don't do that
with a bunch of statistical gimmicks.

01:53:00.139 --> 01:53:02.937
Nobody reinvents this game.

01:53:46.185 --> 01:53:47.584
Yeah.

01:54:56.155 --> 01:55:01.616
Due respect to the Coliseum,
but this is a ballpark.

01:55:01.827 --> 01:55:03.795
Yes, it is.

01:55:05.898 --> 01:55:08.128
We're gonna have some lunch
in a little bit.

01:55:08.334 --> 01:55:10.529
Why don't I have some coffee
sent up?

01:55:11.237 --> 01:55:12.932
Denise?

01:55:17.610 --> 01:55:19.441
Thank you, Denise.

01:55:19.645 --> 01:55:21.670
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:55:24.650 --> 01:55:28.279
You know, it's her birthday
and I need to get her a present...

01:55:28.487 --> 01:55:31.422
...but she's usually the one
that does that for me.

01:55:32.158 --> 01:55:34.456
So do you have any ideas?

01:55:35.060 --> 01:55:36.391
Scarf.

01:55:36.595 --> 01:55:38.028
You mean like wool?

01:55:38.230 --> 01:55:43.133
No, I meant what women wear with...
You know, decorative.

01:55:43.569 --> 01:55:46.333
And where would I get something
like that?

01:55:47.306 --> 01:55:50.605
No disrespect, I just lost in five
for the second year in a row.

01:55:50.810 --> 01:55:53.108
Get her a bowling ball for all I care.

01:55:53.312 --> 01:55:54.677
Right.

01:55:55.614 --> 01:55:59.106
Well, Steve told me he's offering you
a new contract.

01:56:00.619 --> 01:56:02.280
Yes.

01:56:02.488 --> 01:56:05.116
So why did you return my call?

01:56:07.259 --> 01:56:09.784
Because it's the Red Sox.

01:56:09.995 --> 01:56:14.489
Because I believe science might offer
an answer to the Curse of the Bambino.

01:56:15.234 --> 01:56:20.467
- Because I hear you hired Bill James.
- Yup.

01:56:20.673 --> 01:56:25.337
You know, why someone took so long
to hire that guy is beyond me.

01:56:26.345 --> 01:56:28.643
Well, baseball hates him.

01:56:29.248 --> 01:56:33.912
Well, baseball can hate him,
you know.

01:56:34.119 --> 01:56:38.055
One of the great things about money
is that it buys a lot of things...

01:56:38.257 --> 01:56:41.749
...one of which is the luxury
to disregard what baseball likes...

01:56:41.961 --> 01:56:44.862
...doesn't like, what baseball thinks,
doesn't think.

01:56:47.199 --> 01:56:49.133
Sounds nice.

01:56:51.904 --> 01:56:53.929
Well, I was grateful for the call.

01:56:54.139 --> 01:56:55.970
- You were grateful?
- Yeah.

01:56:59.245 --> 01:57:03.113
For 41 million,
you built a play-off team.

01:57:03.315 --> 01:57:07.581
You lost Damon, Giambi,
Isringhausen, Peña...

01:57:08.053 --> 01:57:11.420
...and you won more games
without them than you did with them.

01:57:11.624 --> 01:57:14.991
You won the exact same number
of games that the Yankees won...

01:57:15.194 --> 01:57:19.062
...but the Yankees spent 1.4 million
per win...

01:57:19.265 --> 01:57:22.701
...and you paid 260,000.

01:57:22.902 --> 01:57:26.929
I know you're taking it in the teeth,
but the first guy through the wall...

01:57:27.406 --> 01:57:29.533
...he always gets bloody.

01:57:29.742 --> 01:57:33.109
Always. This is threatening
not just a way of doing business...

01:57:33.312 --> 01:57:35.803
...but in their minds,
it's threatening the game.

01:57:36.015 --> 01:57:39.280
Really, what it's threatening
is their livelihood, their jobs.

01:57:39.485 --> 01:57:42.454
It's threatening the way
that they do things.

01:57:42.655 --> 01:57:43.986
Every time that happens...

01:57:44.189 --> 01:57:47.647
...whether it's a government,
a way of doing business, whatever...

01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:50.351
...the people
who are holding the reins...

01:57:50.563 --> 01:57:53.088
...they have their hands
on the switch...

01:57:53.299 --> 01:57:55.767
...they go batshit crazy.

01:57:56.835 --> 01:58:01.636
I mean, anybody who's not
tearing their team down right now...

01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:04.900
...and rebuilding it
using your model...

01:58:05.844 --> 01:58:07.607
...they're dinosaurs.

01:58:08.247 --> 01:58:12.650
They'll be sitting on their ass
on the sofa in October...

01:58:12.851 --> 01:58:16.309
...watching the Boston Red Sox
win the World Series.

01:58:21.727 --> 01:58:23.592
What's this?

01:58:23.796 --> 01:58:27.254
I want you to be my general manager.
That's my offer.

01:59:14.246 --> 01:59:15.679
Heads up.

01:59:17.383 --> 01:59:18.372
What was that?

01:59:19.652 --> 01:59:22.678
- Sorry. I don't know.
- What the hell was that?

01:59:23.422 --> 01:59:25.686
You knucklehead.

01:59:33.265 --> 01:59:34.562
How was Boston?

01:59:36.135 --> 01:59:38.000
Impressive.

01:59:44.476 --> 01:59:47.070
Did Henry make you a good offer,
at least?

01:59:48.647 --> 01:59:51.673
- Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
- What was it? What was it?

01:59:51.884 --> 01:59:53.476
- Doesn't matter.
- What was it?

02:00:16.575 --> 02:00:20.033
That makes you the highest-paid GM
in the history of sports.

02:00:22.514 --> 02:00:23.947
So?

02:00:25.784 --> 02:00:26.978
So what?

02:00:30.055 --> 02:00:32.489
I made one decision in my life
based on money.

02:00:32.691 --> 02:00:35.592
And I swore
I would never do it again.

02:00:38.230 --> 02:00:40.221
You're not doing it for the money.

02:00:40.766 --> 02:00:43.234
- No?
- No.

02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:47.761
You're doing it
for what the money says.

02:00:49.241 --> 02:00:52.904
And it says what it says to any player
that makes big money.

02:00:53.612 --> 02:00:55.341
That they're worth it.

02:01:03.822 --> 02:01:05.517
What a dump.

02:01:09.728 --> 02:01:12.026
I really wanted to win here.

02:01:16.101 --> 02:01:18.592
I really did.

02:01:21.140 --> 02:01:23.267
I think you won pretty big, Billy.

02:01:24.143 --> 02:01:26.236
Pete, we lost.

02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:30.405
We lost.

02:01:30.616 --> 02:01:34.052
It's only been a few days.
Give yourself some time to get over it.

02:01:34.253 --> 02:01:38.849
Man, I don't get over these things.
Ever.

02:01:45.898 --> 02:01:49.527
Come with me to the video room.
I wanna show you something.

02:01:51.303 --> 02:01:54.568
No, man,
I'm not up for film right now.

02:01:55.841 --> 02:01:57.900
Come on. Seriously.

02:01:58.110 --> 02:02:00.237
Come on, Billy. Come on.

02:02:01.980 --> 02:02:03.072
The Visalia Oaks...

02:02:03.282 --> 02:02:06.046
...and our 240-pound catcher,
Jeremy Brown...

02:02:06.251 --> 02:02:09.812
...who, as you know,
is scared to run to second base.

02:02:10.022 --> 02:02:11.785
This was in a game six weeks ago.

02:02:12.391 --> 02:02:14.484
This guy's gonna start
with a fastball.

02:02:14.693 --> 02:02:17.093
Jeremy's gonna take him
to deep center.

02:02:19.298 --> 02:02:20.765
Here's what's interesting...

02:02:20.966 --> 02:02:23.799
...because Jeremy's gonna do
what he never does.

02:02:24.002 --> 02:02:25.264
He's gonna go for it.

02:02:25.470 --> 02:02:28.667
He's gonna round first
and he's gonna go for it.

02:02:29.942 --> 02:02:31.170
Okay?

02:02:34.513 --> 02:02:39.450
This is all of Jeremy's nightmares
coming to life.

02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:45.317
- They're laughing at him.
- And Jeremy's about to find out why.

02:02:48.527 --> 02:02:50.859
Jeremy's about to realize...

02:02:52.364 --> 02:02:55.458
...that the ball went 60 feet
over the fence.

02:02:58.103 --> 02:03:01.698
He hit a home run
and didn't even realize it.

02:03:31.737 --> 02:03:34.729
How can you not be romantic
about baseball?

02:03:39.711 --> 02:03:42.578
- It's a metaphor.
- I know it's a metaphor.

02:03:47.352 --> 02:03:48.683
Okay.

02:03:52.791 --> 02:03:55.783
Pete, you're a good egg.

02:03:59.264 --> 02:04:00.959
I'll call you.

02:05:01.827 --> 02:05:05.354
Hey, Dad, this is the song I told you
I'd record.

02:05:05.564 --> 02:05:08.260
Please don't show it to anyone else.

02:05:08.467 --> 02:05:11.493
Let me know if you change your mind
and stay in California.

02:05:11.703 --> 02:05:14.695
If not, you're a really great dad.
