WEBVTT

00:03.037 --> 00:05.806
And whoever finds the cow
gets a free dessert.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.675
Oh, that's so cute!
I know!

00:08.942 --> 00:10.511
So, any big plans
for the weekend?

00:10.544 --> 00:11.812
No, not really.

00:11.845 --> 00:14.315
Just gonna make some smoothies,
stop by Rite-Aid,

00:14.348 --> 00:15.816
watch a Kent State
documentary.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.017
No. No way.

00:17.051 --> 00:18.552
I know.
It's still hard to believe.

00:18.586 --> 00:19.687
They were just kids.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.822
No. I mean, you are
too fun a guy

00:21.855 --> 00:23.391
to have that boring
of a weekend, Louis.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.159
Hey, you ought
to come bowling with me

00:25.193 --> 00:26.560
and a group of my friends
on Saturday.

00:26.594 --> 00:27.861
You already have
a group of friends?

00:27.895 --> 00:29.830
Because of bowling.
It's an intramural league.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.833
Great way to meet great people.
You would love the guys.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.835
Oh, yeah?
Oh, absolutely.

00:34.868 --> 00:38.106
Oliver, Sebastian,
Gabe, Buckets.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.241
He's the only one who's
earned a nickname so far.

00:40.274 --> 00:42.410
His real name
is Jeffrey Polaccia.

00:42.443 --> 00:43.777
Polaccia. Foccacia.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.779
Olive oil. Popeye. Muscles.

00:45.813 --> 00:46.880
Jean-Claude Van Damme.

00:46.914 --> 00:48.449
Women.
"Little Women."

00:48.482 --> 00:49.850
Kirsten Dunst. Pale.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.885
"Pail" with an "I."
Buckets!

00:51.919 --> 00:54.522
Train of thought!
Yeah!

00:54.555 --> 00:55.923
Now you got to come.

00:55.956 --> 00:57.758
Bowling does sound fun.

00:57.791 --> 01:00.361
I just have to check with
the old ball and chain first.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.562
Hey.
Hey!

01:02.730 --> 01:05.533
What do you think about
me going bowling

01:05.566 --> 01:08.102
with Matthew Chestnut
and his friends this weekend?

01:08.136 --> 01:10.538
-- Captions by VITAC --

01:10.571 --> 01:11.705
* Fresh off the boat

01:11.739 --> 01:13.407
* I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go *

01:13.441 --> 01:15.709
* If you don't know, homey,
now you know *

01:15.743 --> 01:16.944
* Fresh off the boat

01:16.977 --> 01:18.946
* Homey, you don't know
where I come from *

01:18.979 --> 01:20.581
* But I know where I'm goin'

01:20.614 --> 01:22.816
* I'm fresh off the boat

01:24.652 --> 01:26.654
I don't know.
Maybe I won't go bowling.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.156
I don't know Matthew
outside of work,

01:28.189 --> 01:29.623
and I never met
any of his friends.

01:29.657 --> 01:31.125
It would be different
if you could come,

01:31.159 --> 01:33.794
but you're going to this
bachelor party in Savannah.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.129
I planned a scavenger hunt.

01:35.163 --> 01:37.298
First one that finds
a Democrat wins.

01:39.133 --> 01:41.135
Come on. You don't need me.

01:41.169 --> 01:43.137
You'll be a little nervous
at first, but you'll settle in.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.972
Some of my fondest
memories were spent with people

01:45.005 --> 01:46.840
that I didn't even know
at the beginning of the night.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.776
Hmm.
Yeah, maybe you're right.

01:48.809 --> 01:49.910
Attaboy.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.145
Just make sure
you stay sober enough

01:51.179 --> 01:53.814
to pick me up
from the airport on Sunday.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.683
God knows Honey
can't do it.

01:55.716 --> 01:58.786
Arrivals, arrivals.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.621
Arrivals. Okay.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.022
No! No!

02:02.055 --> 02:03.357
How am I in
the departures lane?!

02:05.125 --> 02:06.794
I am trying my best!

02:06.827 --> 02:09.129
Shut up!

02:10.864 --> 02:13.467
The last time,
I had to take a taxi

02:13.501 --> 02:15.969
from the airport to pick
her up at a Jack in the Box.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.540
**

02:19.573 --> 02:21.141
Hello.

02:21.175 --> 02:22.876
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.212
Well, it doesn't matter now.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.646
The middle school's production

02:25.679 --> 02:26.814
of "Anne of Green Gables"

02:26.847 --> 02:28.349
started 20 minutes ago.

02:28.382 --> 02:29.517
By the time we get there,

02:29.550 --> 02:30.951
Anne will already
be out of the gable.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.052
I'm sorry.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.854
I had to try on
five different outfits

02:33.887 --> 02:35.789
to find one to fit my baby bump.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.691
And I hadn't even
started on my hair.

02:37.725 --> 02:38.959
But you're not
even showing.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.861
You have no idea
how tight my clothes are.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.196
There's no margin for error.

02:42.230 --> 02:44.164
You know, Honey,
once you have a kid,

02:44.198 --> 02:45.299
you're not gonna have time

02:45.333 --> 02:46.967
to get yourself
all dolled up every day.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.237
Trust me.
If you think I'm beautiful now,

02:49.270 --> 02:51.405
you should have seen me
when I had time to try.

02:53.207 --> 02:54.475
Quick chat.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.543
Uh-oh.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.177
It sounds like I'm in trouble.

02:57.211 --> 02:58.712
Have a seat.

03:01.615 --> 03:04.017
Honey, the amount
of time you spend getting ready

03:04.051 --> 03:05.519
is affecting
our group plans.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.655
Last week, we were supposed
to go to a puppet show.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.056
Before that,
we were supposed to see

03:09.089 --> 03:10.891
the cast of "One Life to Live"
at the mall.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.192
You need a new
pregnancy look --

03:12.226 --> 03:14.094
one that will get you
out of the door faster

03:14.127 --> 03:16.997
because next week,
the community pool opens.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.732
If you're not there
right at 9:00,

03:18.766 --> 03:20.000
you don't get a chair,

03:20.033 --> 03:22.436
and you'll have to put
your towel on the ground.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.372
On the ground.

03:24.405 --> 03:27.508
I would actually
love a new look.

03:27.541 --> 03:31.178
I'm ready for something more
mature and low-maintenance,

03:31.211 --> 03:33.614
but I don't have
any idea where to start.

03:33.647 --> 03:34.682
We'll help you.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.950
Close your eyes.

03:36.984 --> 03:39.787
Think Princess Di
pregnant with Harry.

03:41.255 --> 03:43.957
**

03:43.991 --> 03:45.593
What are you doing
this weekend?

03:45.626 --> 03:47.395
I was thinking about
seeing a movie.

03:47.428 --> 03:48.862
Yeah.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.365
Uh, I thought I'd see
a movie, too.

03:51.399 --> 03:56.537
**

03:56.570 --> 03:58.071
Bye.

04:00.641 --> 04:01.775
Hey, Eddie.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.110
Did you have
any trouble getting in?

04:03.143 --> 04:05.313
No.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.648
The man with the rubber glove
was surprisingly gentle.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.950
I'm dying!
I'm gonna die!

04:09.983 --> 04:11.919
I love Jim Carrey
so much!

04:11.952 --> 04:14.254
Together:
"Do not go in there!"

04:14.288 --> 04:16.223
"Whew!"

04:16.256 --> 04:17.625
Um, Nicole?

04:17.658 --> 04:19.793
Where were you
with the "whew"?

04:23.163 --> 04:25.165
Don't tell me you still
haven't asked out Jackie.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.335
Are you kidding me?

04:27.368 --> 04:28.902
You guys have been talking
for weeks!

04:28.936 --> 04:30.003
I know!

04:30.037 --> 04:32.005
But every time I try,

04:32.039 --> 04:34.141
I get super nervous
and I chicken out.

04:34.174 --> 04:36.344
Okay, why don't
we do a group thing?

04:36.377 --> 04:37.611
So there'll
be less pressure.

04:37.645 --> 04:38.846
I'll come with you
on the date,

04:38.879 --> 04:40.180
and once you guys
get comfortable,

04:40.213 --> 04:42.282
I'll just slide on out.

04:42.316 --> 04:43.684
Yeah.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.954
That would make it
less scary.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.789
Okay. Wait here.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.824
I'm gonna go do it.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.863
"Hey, girl.
Y'all hiring?"

04:55.896 --> 04:58.131
"Yeah. What job
you interested in?"

04:58.165 --> 04:59.433
"Being your girlfriend."

04:59.467 --> 05:02.135
"Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
You stupid.

05:02.169 --> 05:04.372
You got the job.
When can you start?"

05:04.405 --> 05:05.839
"How about right now?"

05:05.873 --> 05:07.508
" But the customers!"

05:07.541 --> 05:10.478
"I'm giving you a thumbs-up
'cause you're so smart, Eddie.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.646
Err'one underestimates you."

05:12.680 --> 05:15.215
**

05:15.248 --> 05:16.850
What if I get there
before Matthew

05:16.884 --> 05:18.619
and I have to pretend
I don't see four other men

05:18.652 --> 05:20.320
wearing the same
bowling shirt as me?

05:20.354 --> 05:23.156
You got to calm down, Louis.
This is low-stakes.

05:23.190 --> 05:25.526
If you're not having a good
time, you just come home.

05:25.559 --> 05:28.328
Besides, bowling is
just golf for people

05:28.362 --> 05:29.997
who like germs anyway.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.299
I heard that sadists
hide needles in the ball holes

05:32.332 --> 05:34.935
with little notes that say,
"Congrats. Now you have hep-C."

05:36.236 --> 05:37.705
I don't know.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.673
**

05:39.707 --> 05:41.875
I am so excited
to get new clothes.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.977
This makeover
can't come soon enough.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.979
I'm afraid my baby
will have a dent on it

05:46.013 --> 05:47.848
that says "Jordache."

05:49.349 --> 05:51.218
Why are we stopping
in front of this quilt store?

05:51.251 --> 05:53.320
This is
a maternity store.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.688
Oh.

05:54.722 --> 05:57.758
They look less elegant when
they're not on Princess Di.

05:57.791 --> 06:00.394
We're working with
a different budget, so...

06:00.428 --> 06:03.363
I don't know.
These outfits are a little --

06:03.397 --> 06:05.766
Ooh, you can wear that one
in the shower!

06:05.799 --> 06:10.237
**

06:10.270 --> 06:11.739
This is my favorite
sushi place.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.006
I came here for
the first time

06:13.040 --> 06:14.575
before I saw
"Life is Beautiful."

06:14.608 --> 06:16.444
Oh, my God.
I'm dying to see that movie.

06:16.477 --> 06:17.778
I think it has a real shot
at Cannes.

06:17.811 --> 06:20.681
Yo. Why is there
mango in this?

06:20.714 --> 06:25.252
I'm just saying if your fish is
quality, you don't need fruit.

06:25.285 --> 06:28.388
It's so crazy
we ran into you

06:28.422 --> 06:30.257
on your way home
from the video store.

06:30.290 --> 06:32.793
Quelle coincidence.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.628
Ah.
Tu parle francais.

06:34.662 --> 06:36.430
My mom's making me take Latin.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.932
I can read the hell
out of money.

06:38.966 --> 06:41.935
So, you probably
want to go watch

06:41.969 --> 06:43.771
that movie you rented,
huh, Eddie?

06:43.804 --> 06:46.106
Oh, yeah! I rented
"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"

06:46.139 --> 06:47.274
for the millionth time.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.276
See ya, guys.
Have fun.

06:49.309 --> 06:51.912
Ugh.
That movie is awful.

06:51.945 --> 06:54.915
That giant Gumby actor
is the  worst.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.618
Just walk away, Eddie.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.620
You can't control the situation.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.622
You can only control
your reaction.

07:01.655 --> 07:04.157
Don't ruin this for Nicole
by making it about you.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.261
Nope!

07:08.295 --> 07:10.964
By "giant Gumby actor,"

07:10.998 --> 07:12.933
are you referring to
the greatest physical comedian

07:12.966 --> 07:14.468
of our time, Jim Carrey?

07:14.502 --> 07:16.136
What that guy does
is not comedy.

07:16.169 --> 07:17.270
It's vaudeville.

07:17.304 --> 07:18.939
He might as well be
touring with the circus.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.107
They'd be lucky to have him!

07:20.140 --> 07:21.675
Please. Jim Carrey
has never done

07:21.709 --> 07:23.410
anything of cultural
significance.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.845
Oh. Okay.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.514
Let me just call up
the Wayans brothers

07:26.547 --> 07:27.815
and let them know that
"In Living Color"

07:27.848 --> 07:29.249
wasn't
"culturally significant."

07:29.282 --> 07:31.719
Nicole, Jim Carrey
is hilarious, right?

07:35.823 --> 07:37.591
He is pretty broad.

07:37.625 --> 07:44.297
**

07:44.331 --> 07:45.599
-Oh, Louis!

07:45.633 --> 07:46.767
I'm so glad you made it.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.468
Let me introduce you
to the guys.

07:48.502 --> 07:52.873
That is Sebastian,
Oliver, Buckets, and Gabe.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.007
You can call me
Sweetwater.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.142
No. No.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.044
You cannot give yourself
a nickname, Gabe.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.312
Do not call him...
Sweetwater.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.783
Um, it's nice
to meet you guys.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.384
-Good to meet you.
-Good to meet you, man.

08:04.417 --> 08:05.586
Y-Y-You too.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.127
Oliver is from Richmond.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.128
Oh!

08:15.162 --> 08:16.964
I still go back
for Christmas.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.666
Oh. Wow.

08:22.435 --> 08:25.072
Yeah.

08:27.708 --> 08:28.809
It's, uh,
cold in here.

08:28.842 --> 08:29.810
Mm.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.583
Well...

08:41.789 --> 08:43.156
Oh.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.224
Oh.

08:44.257 --> 08:47.160
I told you
we had pizza rolls!

08:48.428 --> 08:50.063
You guys
got any ranch?

08:51.599 --> 08:54.067
Oh, no.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.107
Aah!

09:00.140 --> 09:01.842
How could you do this?!

09:01.875 --> 09:03.611
I know.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.947
I hit the sauce pretty hard,
but Buckets kept buying shots.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.782
I'm not mad at you
for being drunk.

09:08.816 --> 09:11.919
I'm mad at you because
you can't handle having friends.

09:15.956 --> 09:16.957
Louis!

09:16.990 --> 09:18.325
Huh?
What happened?

09:23.597 --> 09:25.565
What do you mean I can't
handle having friends?

09:25.599 --> 09:27.267
I can see
the warning signs.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.937
You did this in your 20s when
you got a new group of friends.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.372
You offer your help
with everything --

09:32.405 --> 09:35.575
helping them move,
de-popcorning their ceiling,

09:35.609 --> 09:37.310
walking your
roommate's dog...

09:37.344 --> 09:38.378
Gizmo.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.413
I mean, if anything,
he was walking me.

09:40.447 --> 09:43.651
...until you completely
overextend yourself.

09:43.684 --> 09:46.386
Your body breaks down,
and you slip a disc.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.623
You do fine when you have
one good friend, like Marvin.

09:49.657 --> 09:51.291
But when you have
a whole group of them,

09:51.324 --> 09:52.926
you spread yourself
too thin.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.395
And it always starts
with pizza rolls.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.164
Oh, come on.
That was a long time ago.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.800
Exactly.
You're not in college anymore.

09:59.833 --> 10:00.968
If you injure yourself,

10:01.001 --> 10:03.270
you're not just missing
an Ultimate Frisbee game.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.938
You have a family
you have to think about.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.107
I'm just having fun
with my new friends.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.575
I'm not helping
any of them.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.510
Now, tomorrow we have plans
to go to a Hooters

10:10.543 --> 10:11.945
and eat hot wings.
That's it.

10:13.881 --> 10:15.582
Sure, Louis. Sure.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.685
You're going to a Hooters.

10:17.718 --> 10:20.620
What are you really doing?
Cleaning out Gabe's garage?

10:20.654 --> 10:22.322
Helping Oliver
hang shelves?

10:22.355 --> 10:25.358
I swear on our children's lives
that I am going to a Hooters!

10:30.964 --> 10:31.965
Yo!

10:31.999 --> 10:33.633
What was that
the other day?

10:33.667 --> 10:35.168
Yeah, what was that?

10:35.202 --> 10:37.637
Jackie was so upset after
you told her that Jim Carrey

10:37.671 --> 10:39.840
could "hump circles around
Roberto Benigni"

10:39.873 --> 10:41.141
that she went home.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.976
She didn't even eat her
toothpicked orange slices.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.445
Well, maybe you should have
stuck up for me and Jim Carrey.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.613
Maybe I should have,

10:46.646 --> 10:48.448
but I just really wanted
Jackie to like me.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.150
But you weren't
being yourself.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.352
Oh, you've never
said you liked something

10:52.385 --> 10:53.854
you didn't
to impress a girl.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.455
You let me
pierce your ear.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.957
I was brave, though,
right?

10:56.990 --> 10:59.292
I needed your help, Eddie.

10:59.326 --> 11:02.062
This is the first girl
I've ever liked.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.396
You're right.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.632
I'm sorry.
Let me have a do-over.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.701
We'll go hang out with
Jackie on her lunch break,

11:07.735 --> 11:09.469
and this time,
I'll just stay quiet

11:09.502 --> 11:11.705
and be a good wingman like
I should have done last time.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.006
Cool.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.743
But don't order biscotti
in your William Shatner voice.

11:15.776 --> 11:16.744
It's not funny.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.078
"Beam me up, Biscotti"?!

11:18.111 --> 11:19.412
How is that not funny?

11:19.446 --> 11:21.815
**

11:21.849 --> 11:23.150
You look amazing, Honey.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.085
Honey: It's definitely
low-maintenance,

11:25.118 --> 11:27.520
like one of the house dresses
my grandma wore

11:27.554 --> 11:28.588
when her sunburn peeled.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.090
-Jessica.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.258
Give me
your honest opinion.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.760
What do you think of --
I can't right now.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.928
I have to go to Hooters
to prove that Louis isn't there

11:34.962 --> 11:36.396
and catch him
in his lie, but...

11:36.429 --> 11:38.498
when you're done wearing
my curtains,

11:38.531 --> 11:40.267
would you mind
hanging them

11:40.300 --> 11:41.769
back up
before I get back?

11:46.239 --> 11:47.841
I think I just have to
get used to it.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.843
You know who else just
had to get used to it?

11:49.877 --> 11:51.711
The People's Princess
when she saw herself

11:51.745 --> 11:53.613
in a crown
for the first time.

11:53.646 --> 11:56.116
Charles never understood her.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.717
I mean, how could he?

11:57.751 --> 12:00.420
**

12:00.453 --> 12:03.090
Hello, Hooter.
I'm looking for my husband.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.691
Oh,
what's he look like?

12:04.724 --> 12:07.060
I'm sure to you
he looks like me in a boy-wig,

12:07.094 --> 12:08.862
but if you could take off
your Anglo-goggles

12:08.896 --> 12:10.063
for just one minute,

12:10.097 --> 12:13.266
he's about 5'9", hairless,
but still manly.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.768
And that's what I'm talking
about, you know?

12:17.137 --> 12:19.773
Mira's here. Quick.
Unlock the back door!

12:19.807 --> 12:22.776
He likes to shuffle his feet
when he finishes sentences.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.913
I'll just look for him myself.
He's probably not here anyway.

12:29.950 --> 12:34.721
Kirsten Dunst. Pale.
"Pail" with an "I". Buckets!

12:36.623 --> 12:39.126
That's so great.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.327
She gets it.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.262
Anything else?
I think we're good.

12:42.295 --> 12:45.265
I can't believe you were
really at a Hooters, Louis!

12:45.298 --> 12:46.934
I am so proud of you.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.436
I told you I've outgrown
overextending myself.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.404
Well, go have a great rest
of the night with your friends.

12:55.675 --> 12:56.944
All right, let's
take this party

12:56.977 --> 12:58.745
to a gas station
with a slushie machine!

12:59.813 --> 13:01.414
I wish.
Uh, I got to get back home

13:01.448 --> 13:02.916
and relieve Stef
with the baby.

13:02.950 --> 13:06.119
I can't remember the last time
we had a night out together.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.421
Oh, no, Sebastian.
That's terrible.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.190
Well...
Hmm.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.359
Your car is idling
a little rough, Buckets.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.127
Pop the hood.
I just need 10 minutes.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.462
Buckets: Oh.

13:16.864 --> 13:20.333
Does anybody know why
the Hooters mascot is an owl?

13:20.367 --> 13:24.637
Are -- Are the owl's...
eyes...boobs?

13:27.574 --> 13:30.343
So, that's the first time
art touched my soul.

13:30.377 --> 13:33.013
Wow.
So, what was the second?

13:33.046 --> 13:35.048
That's a better story,
actually.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.950
So, I stayed up
all night to watch...

13:36.984 --> 13:38.718
Jester: Get your butts
above the hard deck

13:38.751 --> 13:40.353
and return to base immediately.

13:40.387 --> 13:41.654
**

13:41.688 --> 13:44.057
Tower, this is Ghost Rider
requesting a flyby.

13:44.091 --> 13:46.326
Negative, Ghost Rider.
The pattern is full.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.395
No, no, Mav.
This is not a good idea.

13:48.428 --> 13:52.565
Sorry, Goose, but it's
time to buzz the tower.

13:52.599 --> 13:55.002
**

13:55.035 --> 13:56.203
So I have to drive
my little brother

13:56.236 --> 13:57.905
to a Third Eye Blind
concert.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.339
Their music sucks.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.975
It so does.
I hate Third Eye Blind.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.577
Wait. I thought the other night
you said you liked them.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.813
Um...no.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.348
I-I said that ironically.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.750
Uh, like I s-say how I like
French.

14:10.783 --> 14:12.719
So you don't like French?

14:12.752 --> 14:14.521
No. What? I do.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.924
Brain fart.

14:17.891 --> 14:20.260
I should go.
Andrew is slammed.

14:20.293 --> 14:23.096
"Son, you have
no future in art."

14:23.130 --> 14:25.398
Well, Mom, how
do you explain this?!

14:32.772 --> 14:35.008
That's right, Iceman.
I am dangerous!

14:35.042 --> 14:36.109
What happened?

14:36.143 --> 14:37.744
Where's Jackie?

14:37.777 --> 14:39.112
**

14:39.146 --> 14:40.948
You and Stef have fun.

14:40.981 --> 14:44.451
* Rollin' with my homies

14:44.484 --> 14:47.620
You only get one chance to catch
the judges' eye, Mackenzie.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.289
* Rollin' with my homies

14:49.322 --> 14:50.290
* Sippin' yak all night

14:50.323 --> 14:52.926
You see, Lucas,
women have a flower,

14:52.960 --> 14:56.096
and men have a watering can,
or penis.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.898
* Rollin' with my homies

14:58.932 --> 15:00.367
* Sippin' yak all night

15:00.400 --> 15:03.803
Any mother of Matthew's
is a mother of mine.

15:03.836 --> 15:05.973
* And it's all right

15:06.006 --> 15:08.208
* Rollin' with my homies

15:08.241 --> 15:09.576
* Sippin' yak all night

15:09.609 --> 15:10.743
* Yeah

15:10.777 --> 15:11.945
* I got us on the way
in the C-B-T *

15:11.979 --> 15:13.146
Ohh!

15:13.180 --> 15:14.447
* And it's all right

15:14.481 --> 15:15.782
Ohh!

15:17.484 --> 15:19.286
Your blood pressure
is perfect,

15:19.319 --> 15:21.254
and your lung health
is strong.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.623
You are in
excellent shape, Seb.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.292
Just, uh, promise me
you'll lay off

15:25.325 --> 15:26.626
those
Keebler Fudge Stripes.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.228
Hey, I don't make promises
I can't keep.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.296
Okay!

15:29.329 --> 15:30.497
I do think I should
take a look

15:30.530 --> 15:32.299
at your friend who gave
you a ride here, though.

15:32.332 --> 15:33.400
Oh.
He has, uh,

15:33.433 --> 15:34.767
clearly slipped a disc.

15:34.801 --> 15:37.004
I'm sorry it's a little
dirty down there.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.172
I can clean it for you.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.478
Don't cry.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.981
Do not cry!

15:48.015 --> 15:49.116
Hey, muffin!

15:50.217 --> 15:52.619
"Muffin"?
Did you just make that up?

15:52.652 --> 15:53.820
Oh, I love that!

15:53.853 --> 15:56.023
Oh, my God!

15:56.056 --> 15:57.790
Muffin!

16:03.997 --> 16:05.765
We can still fix this.
What should I do?

16:05.798 --> 16:07.467
What can I say to make
Jackie like me?

16:07.500 --> 16:09.369
Nicole, you can't make
someone like you.

16:09.402 --> 16:10.970
I just don't know
what to say anymore.

16:11.004 --> 16:13.306
I keep telling her these things
I think she wants to hear,

16:13.340 --> 16:14.507
but nothing is working.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.109
Because it's not real.

16:16.143 --> 16:18.111
You got to be yourself.

16:18.145 --> 16:20.947
You're awesome, and if you
show Jackie the real you,

16:20.980 --> 16:22.315
she'll think so, too.

16:22.349 --> 16:26.186
**

16:26.219 --> 16:27.554
Yeah.

16:29.589 --> 16:32.125
Cheerio.
Welcome to the Tower of London,

16:32.159 --> 16:33.126
ya old booz-ah!

16:33.160 --> 16:35.328
Go grind some beans,
Andrew.

16:35.362 --> 16:36.963
I'm really busy, Nicole.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.665
I don't speak French.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.168
I'm super into
Third Eye Blind.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.636
I saw them when
they opened for Oasis.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.739
I will never see
"Life is Beautiful."

16:46.773 --> 16:50.810
But most importantly,
I absolutely, balls to the wall,

16:50.843 --> 16:52.579
love Jim Carrey.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.081
"Dumb and Dumber"
is the funniest movie

16:54.114 --> 16:55.548
I've ever seen in my life.

16:55.582 --> 16:58.485
I lied to you about
all of that stuff

16:58.518 --> 17:01.388
s-so -- so you'd like me.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.056
Because I really like you.

17:03.090 --> 17:06.759
**

17:06.793 --> 17:08.595
I'm sorry, Nicole.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.430
I can get over
the other things,

17:10.463 --> 17:14.033
but I can't be with someone
who just speaks one language.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.736
Call me if you decide
to expand your borders.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.505
There's a whole world
out there.

17:18.538 --> 17:21.874
**

17:23.210 --> 17:24.344
I'm so sorry.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.945
That did not go how
I thought it would.

17:25.978 --> 17:28.115
Actually...

17:28.148 --> 17:29.749
it's fine.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.518
Really?
You were right.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.586
I've spent such
a long time pretending

17:33.620 --> 17:35.255
to be someone I'm not.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.890
And I'm not gonna start
that again now.

17:37.924 --> 17:40.093
You really are awesome,
Nicole.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.694
And don't worry.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.397
Nobody ever winds up with
the first girl they like.

17:44.431 --> 17:45.732
Look at your dad.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.400
Okay, Eddie.

17:47.434 --> 17:49.902
I have 8:51.
What do you have?

17:53.005 --> 17:53.973
What are you wearing?

17:54.006 --> 17:55.375
It's the maternity dress
we bought.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.644
It just needed a little help
from my old friend Janome.

17:58.778 --> 17:59.946
That's a sewing-machine brand.

17:59.979 --> 18:02.149
The whole point was to
get you a simpler look

18:02.182 --> 18:04.584
so you'd be on time.

18:04.617 --> 18:06.386
I have 8:52 now!

18:06.419 --> 18:08.054
It'll get better when
I alter all the dresses

18:08.087 --> 18:11.391
because my hair only takes me
10 minutes now.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.460
I'm getting hours
of my life back,

18:13.493 --> 18:14.694
and it's thanks to you guys.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.931
That's great, Honey.
We're happy for you.

18:18.965 --> 18:21.668
I guess it is nice helping
a person improve their life.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.736
Come on.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.439
We're gonna quit inviting
her places, right?

18:26.473 --> 18:27.674
She's out. 100%.

18:30.877 --> 18:37.484
**

18:37.517 --> 18:39.452
You've been doing a child's
science project!

18:39.486 --> 18:40.820
And don't say Evan!

18:40.853 --> 18:43.756
I know he thinks glitter is
a distraction from quality work.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.526
No, the glitter is from
a Hooters waitress, I swear.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.295
You slipped a disc.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.696
I didn't!

18:49.729 --> 18:52.932
Then get up
and walk to me.

18:55.402 --> 19:01.274
**

19:01.308 --> 19:03.643
Why do you
always do this?

19:03.676 --> 19:05.011
I don't know.

19:05.044 --> 19:07.780
I just want people
to want to be my friend.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.449
Well, they do.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.784
But not because
you do stuff for them.

19:11.818 --> 19:15.054
Because they just
like you.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.957
You're a good person
and a good friend.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.859
Louis:  Marvin!

19:20.927 --> 19:24.364
I know my buddy Lou
will be here any minute now.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.636
You just have to learn
how to strike a balance.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.639
When you try to do too many
things for too many people,

19:32.672 --> 19:34.974
you end up neglecting
the ones closest to --

19:35.007 --> 19:37.410
You are not listening to me,
are you?

19:38.778 --> 19:42.249
Where does this compulsion
to help people come from, Louis?

19:42.282 --> 19:44.217
It has to come
from somewhere.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.585
Okay.

19:45.618 --> 19:48.154
When I was in third grade,
my friend Sam asked me

19:48.187 --> 19:51.258
to take care of his parrot,
Lulu, while he was on vacation.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.760
I was so excited because
I never had a pet before.

19:53.793 --> 19:56.829
Sam told me that it was
important that Lulu

19:56.863 --> 19:59.699
finished all her meals
because she was on antibiotics

19:59.732 --> 20:02.269
and how it would be best
if I hand-fed her.

20:02.302 --> 20:05.037
Well, it took some time
for Lulu to trust me,

20:05.071 --> 20:06.873
but when Sam
got back from Bimini --

20:06.906 --> 20:08.275
What does this have
to do with anything?

20:08.308 --> 20:10.277
Nothing!
I made it up.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.944
I could tell that you wanted
an origin story,

20:11.978 --> 20:13.780
and I wanted to give you one
because I liked that you needed

20:13.813 --> 20:14.881
that from me.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.083
Why was Lulu
on antibiotics?

20:17.116 --> 20:19.386
I like being "the guy,"
okay?

20:19.419 --> 20:22.088
The guy who people call
when they need something,

20:22.121 --> 20:24.257
the guy who's always around.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.758
I like to be needed.

20:25.792 --> 20:28.695
Sometimes all people need
from you is your friendship.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.797
Hey, buddy, you hardly
help me at all,

20:30.830 --> 20:32.098
and I love
hanging out with you.

20:32.131 --> 20:34.267
I just drove you round-trip
to the Tampa airport

20:34.301 --> 20:36.736
because it was cheaper
than flying out of Orlando.

20:36.769 --> 20:40.239
I love being by the beach.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.342
**

20:46.479 --> 20:48.915
Looks like I got to
repaint my rec room.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.283
Let me
tell you something --

20:50.317 --> 20:53.085
Never paint a family space
with a flat finish.

20:53.119 --> 20:55.555
Fingerprints show up
like stars in a Montana sky.

20:55.588 --> 20:56.956
And I can't
just paint one wall

20:56.989 --> 20:58.791
'cause then it'll be brighter
than all the others.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.460
Matthew, I will not repaint
your rec room for you.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.662
I didn't think you would.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.331
I hired painters.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.733
You still want to be friends
with me?

21:06.766 --> 21:08.968
Of course! Yeah!

21:09.001 --> 21:10.937
Me and the guys love
hanging out with you...

21:10.970 --> 21:12.639
Dogwood.

21:12.672 --> 21:13.940
A nickname?

21:13.973 --> 21:15.141
Yeah.

21:15.174 --> 21:19.979
Slipped disc. Disc. Frisbee.
Dog. Tree. Dogwood.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.147
You earned it!

21:22.382 --> 21:24.851
Just do not tell Gabe.
He'll jump off a bridge.

21:24.884 --> 21:26.319
Oh.
