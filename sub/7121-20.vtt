Anyway, start the
next video, Beemo.

00:51.843 --> 00:55.473
We got to crack the code on the
Ice King's evil secret tapes!

00:59.685 --> 01:01.483
Brrr! You guys cold?

01:01.562 --> 01:04.441
Yeah, it's kinda chilly in here.

01:09.987 --> 01:12.661
What's on those tapes?

01:12.739 --> 01:14.787
I can kind of make it out.

01:14.866 --> 01:18.336
Dang it, Beemo, just turn
to your right a little.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.790
Ugh! By the power of ice,

01:20.872 --> 01:23.967
I want your cup of
cocoa to fall over!

01:25.877 --> 01:27.049
Yes!

01:27.129 --> 01:29.598
Now turn and pick it up.

01:29.673 --> 01:31.550
Yes. Yes.

01:32.718 --> 01:35.892
That's... me?

01:35.971 --> 01:38.349
They're watching
my secret tapes?!

01:39.349 --> 01:40.601
And they're cozy!

01:40.684 --> 01:43.403
I'll show them.

01:43.478 --> 01:46.573
This snowman looks pretty good.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.696
Pretty darn good.

01:56.742 --> 01:58.289
Wenk.

01:58.368 --> 02:01.042
Could / have five
more minutes, please?

02:14.635 --> 02:16.933
I think I can break
the code, Finn.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.104
Really?

02:18.180 --> 02:20.774
Yes, I have detected
a noticeable pattern

02:20.849 --> 02:23.022
in the tears of
sadness that fall

02:23.101 --> 02:25.900
from the Ice King's eyeballs.

02:25.979 --> 02:30.325
His tears drop at an equal
rate until the 13th tear,

02:30.400 --> 02:34.371
when the right side drops
two tears instead of one.

02:34.446 --> 02:36.824
- Whoa.
- This is so fascinating.

02:36.907 --> 02:39.535
The 13th letter of
the alphabet is

02:39.618 --> 02:41.495
if I print the letter "m"

02:41.578 --> 02:44.377
every time Ice King
says an "m" word

02:44.456 --> 02:47.335
it looks like this.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.044
Oh, my glob, Jake. Ls this it?

02:49.127 --> 02:53.257
Could this be the Ice
King's evil secret?

02:53.340 --> 02:54.967
What does it mean?!

02:56.927 --> 02:58.895
Some of you won't survive this.

02:58.970 --> 03:02.645
You'll melt or split in half
or your head will fall off.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.352
But that's fine, because
you're made of snow.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.358
Only one thing matters today...

03:07.437 --> 03:10.816
Getting into that tree house,
getting my tapes back,

03:10.899 --> 03:13.322
and beating up Finn and Jake!

03:13.402 --> 03:15.871
Maybe Beemo. Yeah, Beemo, too.

03:15.946 --> 03:17.619
Who's with me?

03:19.324 --> 03:21.042
Hey, Why are you guys So quiet?

03:21.118 --> 03:22.916
Are you mad?

03:22.994 --> 03:25.247
Oh, that's right,
you're not alive yet.

03:25.330 --> 03:29.130
My bad.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.394
Give me my tapes back.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.892
No, man! I know you've got
evil secrets on these,

03:41.972 --> 03:43.690
and we're gonna find them!

03:43.765 --> 03:46.314
Snowmen, attack!

03:48.645 --> 03:51.524
Aah!

03:51.606 --> 03:52.903
Crup, Jake!

03:52.983 --> 03:56.362
We got to unravel these
evil secrets at warp crazy!

04:00.365 --> 04:01.537
Good morning.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.289
You're watching
the evening news.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.120
There's been an
unfortunate event.

04:05.203 --> 04:07.581
Let's go talk to some witnesses.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.630
Princess, what is your name?

04:14.713 --> 04:17.466
Please, let me go home!

04:17.548 --> 04:20.928
So, Princess
Please-let-me-go-home, tell me,

04:21.011 --> 04:23.764
what was it like to
experience this tragedy?

04:23.847 --> 04:25.599
What? I can...

04:25.682 --> 04:27.434
I don't, uh, uh...

04:27.517 --> 04:29.986
Yeah, we're on air,
honey, so spit it out.

04:30.061 --> 04:33.406
I... I don't know what
you're talking about.

04:33.482 --> 04:36.281
Obviously traumatized and
in a state of shock.

04:36.359 --> 04:40.739
Let's go ask somebody
else something.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.745
Upside-down Princess,
do you think

04:42.824 --> 04:46.044
things will change politically
because of today's events?

04:46.119 --> 04:48.247
You're really frightening me!

04:48.330 --> 04:50.048
Well, there you have it, folks.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.875
People are very upset

04:51.958 --> 04:54.552
that Gunter tried to
eat Ice King's socks.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.471
Very Upset!

04:56.546 --> 04:59.390
That's why Gunter has
to stay in the corner.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.682
Weird.

05:02.761 --> 05:06.186
He's sneaking in
through the chimney!

05:08.517 --> 05:12.021
Ah, the element of surprise.

05:12.103 --> 05:14.026
Aw, geez, I'm filthy.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.990
Well, now I'm cleaner,
but I'm also nakeder.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.914
Ooh! Mmm.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.708
Just what I need.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.169

05:40.757 --> 05:44.512

eat my fries'? ♪

05:44.594 --> 05:46.813

They wouldn't be

Ooh!

06:17.419 --> 06:21.799
Well, look at you with your
nose shining so bright!

06:21.882 --> 06:24.055
You're so unique!

06:24.134 --> 06:25.681
I'll name you "Red Nose"

06:25.760 --> 06:29.390
and make you leader of the pack!

06:30.765 --> 06:33.564
Well, now you look boring.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.441
If you want something
done right,

06:35.520 --> 06:39.320
you have to do it yourself.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.577
Now give me my evil tapes back!

06:46.656 --> 06:48.624
They're supposed to be buried...

06:48.700 --> 06:50.122
in the ground!

06:51.411 --> 06:54.085
Snow goons!

06:56.333 --> 06:58.631
- Oh, no!
- Don't worry, Beemo.

06:58.710 --> 07:02.214
Aah!

07:02.297 --> 07:04.140
Finn, there's one more tape!

07:04.215 --> 07:06.593
Play it! His evil secret
must be on that tape!

07:06.676 --> 07:10.226
No, Beemo, please don't play it!

07:13.808 --> 07:17.278
Hello, my name is
Simon Petrikov.

07:17.354 --> 07:20.028
I am recording this tape so
that people will know my story.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.985
Oh, no! Turn it off, Beemo!
Turn it off!

07:23.068 --> 07:24.866
I was studying to
be an antiquarian

07:24.945 --> 07:26.743
of ancient artifacts.

07:26.821 --> 07:29.244
Now I never believed in the
supernatural stuff myself,

07:29.324 --> 07:31.747
just had a fascination
with superstitions.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.453
But everything changed

07:33.536 --> 07:36.255
when I came into contact
with this item.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.596
The Ice King!

07:44.798 --> 07:46.175
After purchasing this crown

07:46.257 --> 07:48.555
from an old dock worker
in northern Scandinavia,

07:48.635 --> 07:51.104
I brought it home and excitedly
showed my fiancee, Betty.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.772
I jokingly put it on my head,

07:52.847 --> 07:54.474
just for a laugh or something,

07:54.557 --> 07:56.935
and that's when it started...
the visions.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.770
I fought with them,
shouted at them

07:58.853 --> 08:00.081
until I realized it wasn't real!

08:00.105 --> 08:01.732
It was the crown!

08:01.815 --> 08:02.862
I quickly took it off

08:02.941 --> 08:04.784
and saw my fiancée
in front of me,

08:04.859 --> 08:07.282
looking at me with
such contempt!

08:07.362 --> 08:09.160
What had I said?

08:09.239 --> 08:11.492
What had I done when
I wore this crown?

08:11.574 --> 08:14.544
All I know is, I never
saw Betty again.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.496
Since then, I now see
the visions always,

08:16.579 --> 08:18.877
whether or not I wear the crown.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.459
They tell me the secrets...

08:20.542 --> 08:22.089
the secrets of the ice and snow,

08:22.168 --> 08:25.047
that the power of the crown

08:25.130 --> 08:26.302
will save me with its frost.

08:26.381 --> 08:28.884
I don't yet know
what this means...

08:28.967 --> 08:31.766
As you can see, my skin is
beginning to turn blue,

08:31.845 --> 08:33.688
my body temperature
has been lowering

08:33.763 --> 08:35.059
at a supernatural rate,

08:35.140 --> 08:38.110
to what is now about
30 degrees celsius.

08:38.183 --> 08:40.186
I don't know when it will end.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.147
I'm really scared...

08:42.230 --> 08:44.699
I know my mind is changing,

08:44.774 --> 08:48.995
but I'm already too far
gone to know what to do.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.789
I want people to know
that if I do things,

08:51.865 --> 08:55.665
if... if I do things
that hurt anyone,

08:55.744 --> 08:57.667
please, please forgive me!

08:57.746 --> 08:59.999
Just watch over me until
I can find my way

09:00.081 --> 09:02.129
out of this labyrinth
in my brain

09:02.208 --> 09:04.381
and regain my sanity!

09:04.461 --> 09:06.259
And then maybe Betty,
my princess...

09:06.337 --> 09:08.931
maybe you will love me again.

09:09.007 --> 09:12.602
Please love me again, Betty!

09:14.012 --> 09:15.764
Drama bomb!

09:15.847 --> 09:18.600
Now you know my secret!

09:18.683 --> 09:20.230
You know...

09:20.310 --> 09:22.187
that I used to wear glasses!

09:24.147 --> 09:27.276
Maybe kidnapping Wildberry
Princess will cheer me up.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.156
Wait, Ice King.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.363
Beemo, eject tape, please.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.245
Here, Ice King.

09:39.329 --> 09:42.208
What's this? You're
giving me a gift?

09:42.290 --> 09:44.509
No! It's...

09:44.584 --> 09:46.302
Well, these belong to you.

09:46.377 --> 09:48.846
But it's not even my birthday!

09:48.922 --> 09:51.596
Oh, this is so exciting!
Video tapes!

09:51.674 --> 09:53.722
You know, I had a
bunch of these once,

09:53.802 --> 09:55.304
but I threw them away.

09:55.386 --> 09:57.684
This is great, Finn. Thank you.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.141
It's from me, too.

09:59.224 --> 10:02.603
Oh, I have presents
for you guys, too!

10:02.685 --> 10:04.403
Here, it's a small pine tree.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.607
I chopped it down
in one fell swoop.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.236
And this is for you.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.239
Uh, thanks.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.911
Oh, isn't this fun?

10:11.986 --> 10:15.411
We're exchanging presents.
We're wearing silly clothes.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.367
There's snow everywhere.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.123
Let's do this every day!

10:19.202 --> 10:20.249
Uh...

10:20.328 --> 10:22.422
How about once a year?

10:22.497 --> 10:24.465
Okay.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.793
That sounds good.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.752
<i>And so it was decided,</i>

10:27.836 --> 10:30.555
