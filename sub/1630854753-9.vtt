WEBVTT

00:21.151 --> 00:23.849
"Such a man as Malcolm deserves
nothing short of death."

00:23.849 --> 00:26.113
Elijah's blatantly ordering
his men to kill you.

00:26.113 --> 00:28.028
Our sister mosque in Newark.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.420
Brother Clyde is who
you should speak with.

00:29.420 --> 00:31.814
You can be
a great asset for us,

00:31.814 --> 00:33.685
given all that you learned
about Malcolm.

00:33.685 --> 00:35.470
This is what the CIA
can do for us.

00:35.470 --> 00:36.949
This is where you get
your M-16s,

00:36.949 --> 00:38.342
direct government issue?

00:38.342 --> 00:40.040
But I'm sure Joe Colombo
won't have any problem

00:40.040 --> 00:41.693
with where these guns came from.

00:41.693 --> 00:45.697
We started out small,
but this is gonna be big.

00:45.697 --> 00:48.874
I want you to stay because
I think you can help me.

00:48.874 --> 00:51.051
- And I like you.
- You're crazy.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.792
Kinda be like my female
consigliere, you know?

00:53.792 --> 00:55.316
He thinks
you're cheating him.

00:55.316 --> 00:57.535
His cut last month
was $2 million!

00:57.535 --> 01:00.669
He's never made that much
off heroin! That's a fact!

01:00.669 --> 01:02.497
Part of the reason
for the hit

01:02.497 --> 01:04.629
was he thought I was fuckin'
his daughter, which I wasn't.

01:04.629 --> 01:07.371
But the other part
is that he thinks

01:07.371 --> 01:10.853
the dope puts me in position
to take over his territory.

01:10.853 --> 01:14.987
So I'm gonna prove him right.
I'm takin' Harlem.

01:14.987 --> 01:16.728
I should've smelled a rat
sooner myself.

01:16.728 --> 01:18.034
What?

01:18.034 --> 01:19.644
You were the only one I told

01:19.644 --> 01:22.386
about Malcolm speaking with Che
at the United Nations.

01:22.386 --> 01:24.997
I'm sorry, brother.
I don't trust you anymore.

01:24.997 --> 01:27.304
This partnership is over.

01:27.304 --> 01:30.699
I want your protection dismissed.

01:30.699 --> 01:32.875
You're not going anywhere.
Don't make me do it.

01:35.399 --> 01:38.402
<i>It seems your precautions
were unnecessary after all.</i>

01:38.402 --> 01:41.101
I suggest you take your men
and leave. For good.

01:46.932 --> 01:48.586
Drink?

01:48.586 --> 01:50.153
Mezzacorona?

01:50.153 --> 01:52.416
What's the occasion?

01:52.416 --> 01:55.115
Our most profitable
month yet.

01:55.115 --> 01:59.206
Which brings me to
our first order of business.

01:59.206 --> 02:01.338
I'm able to leverage
the Corsicans

02:01.338 --> 02:05.255
for three times as much dope
in the next shipment.

02:05.255 --> 02:06.778
Good, good.

02:06.778 --> 02:09.781
That'll make it
the largest in history.

02:09.781 --> 02:11.696
Yeah, if we all agree.

02:11.696 --> 02:14.699
Bravo. Bravo.

02:14.699 --> 02:17.137
But it comes
with a requirement.

02:18.660 --> 02:21.619
I want Chin Gigante out.

02:28.104 --> 02:32.587
Young man,
there's a <i>lot</i> to consider.

02:32.587 --> 02:36.112
Chin's the boss
of the most powerful borgata--

02:36.112 --> 02:39.637
He tried to fuckin' whack me, Carlo.

02:39.637 --> 02:47.776
I'm willing to forgive
and forget this, once.

02:47.776 --> 02:50.387
He'll still get his piece,

02:50.387 --> 02:54.217
but he's backseat
on the next shipment.

02:54.217 --> 02:57.481
I need the Commission to give me
full authority over Harlem

02:57.481 --> 03:01.006
for the purposes
of distributing the narcotics.

03:02.704 --> 03:04.923
All in favor?

03:21.810 --> 03:23.203
Yes.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.031
That's good.

03:26.031 --> 03:30.471
Alright, here's to a new ship,
and smooth sailing.

03:30.471 --> 03:31.515
<i>Salut.</i>

03:31.515 --> 03:33.474
<i>- Cin don.
- Salut.</i>

03:33.474 --> 03:35.215
<i>Buona fortuna.</i>

03:39.088 --> 03:41.786
Get up. Let's go.

03:41.786 --> 03:43.701
Get up.

03:43.701 --> 03:45.834
Today's your lucky day.

03:51.143 --> 03:53.363
There you are, my honey.
I love you.

03:53.363 --> 03:55.147
Oh, there he is.

03:55.147 --> 03:57.149
Oh, my honey.
Look at you!

03:57.149 --> 03:59.064
Oh, my God.

03:59.064 --> 04:00.240
Here you are!

04:00.240 --> 04:02.329
Mwah!
My baby!

04:02.329 --> 04:03.895
Look at you!

04:03.895 --> 04:05.288
You're free at last.

04:05.288 --> 04:07.334
This is the happiest day
of my life!

04:07.334 --> 04:08.552
He's home!

04:08.552 --> 04:10.728

of militant speechifying.</i>

05:48.086 --> 05:51.263
<i>His goal is to unite
the more moderate factions</i>

05:51.263 --> 05:55.311
<i>of the Civil Rights Movement
under his fiery leadership.</i>

05:55.311 --> 05:59.315
<i>In Pittsburgh, Los Angeles,
Cleveland, and other cities,</i>

05:59.315 --> 06:02.623
<i>Malcolm's message of violent
revolution should strike fear</i>

06:02.623 --> 06:04.799
<i>in the hearts of every American.</i>

06:04.799 --> 06:08.106
<i>Make no mistake,
this man is a danger</i>

06:08.106 --> 06:10.021
<i>to the American way of life.</i>

06:10.021 --> 06:13.677
Throughout America,
only on a modern scale,

06:13.677 --> 06:17.420
you have a house Negro
and a field Negro.

06:17.420 --> 06:20.118
Before
the Emancipation Proclamation,

06:20.118 --> 06:22.512
they lived
in the white man's house.

06:22.512 --> 06:25.646
And he dressed pretty good,
and he ate good, too,

06:25.646 --> 06:27.778
'cause he ate whatever
the master ate

06:27.778 --> 06:29.389
- ...or whatever he left for him.
- Mm-hmm.

06:29.389 --> 06:33.001
And even more than the master
loved himself,

06:33.001 --> 06:35.873
the house Negro loved
their master.

06:35.873 --> 06:39.834
But the field Negro,
they lived in huts,

06:39.834 --> 06:41.357
in the worst kind of condition,

06:41.357 --> 06:42.706
wearing the worst kind
of clothes,

06:42.706 --> 06:43.794
eating the worst food.

06:43.794 --> 06:45.709
He felt the crack of the whip.

06:45.709 --> 06:48.843
The master fell ill,
they'd hope he'd die.

06:50.671 --> 06:56.416
And today, well, we still have
house Negroes and field Negroes.

06:59.462 --> 07:02.204
It is such a pleasure to be here
in Selma to be with you all,

07:02.204 --> 07:04.075
and I would particularly
like to thank

07:04.075 --> 07:06.513
the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee

07:06.513 --> 07:08.253
for inviting me.

07:08.253 --> 07:10.908
I just hope I haven't offended
any nonviolent students

07:10.908 --> 07:13.215
with my so-called
fiery rhetoric.

07:14.695 --> 07:17.741
Malcolm X.

07:17.741 --> 07:19.395
I'm Andrew Young.

07:19.395 --> 07:21.092
I'm one of the organizers
here in Selma.

07:21.092 --> 07:22.224
I know who you are.

07:22.224 --> 07:23.834
It is a pleasure
to meet you.

07:23.834 --> 07:25.836
I think Dr. King,
were he here,

07:25.836 --> 07:28.012
would have agreed
with everything you said.

07:28.012 --> 07:30.972
- So he's still in jail?
- I'm afraid so.

07:32.277 --> 07:35.585
I'm going to visit Dr. King
tomorrow at the penitentiary.

07:35.585 --> 07:37.282
Come with me.

07:37.282 --> 07:40.068
I want to, but I can't.
I must get back to Harlem.

07:40.068 --> 07:42.287
But please do convey
to Dr. King

07:42.287 --> 07:45.595
that I wish to work more closely
together with him in the future.

07:45.595 --> 07:49.077
There's no reason
we can't combine our efforts.

07:49.077 --> 07:52.863
In your speech, you accurately
describe the differences

07:52.863 --> 07:56.780
between the house
and field Negroes.

07:56.780 --> 07:59.304
Which one do you think
is Dr. King?

07:59.304 --> 08:01.742
Let me put it this way--

08:01.742 --> 08:04.092
if the master's house
caught on fire,

08:04.092 --> 08:06.703
I believe Dr. King
would be standing

08:06.703 --> 08:08.705
right next to me
in the field,

08:08.705 --> 08:11.621
praying for a strong wind
to come along.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.805
This is delicious.

08:21.805 --> 08:25.330
Last night was delicious.

08:25.330 --> 08:26.636
We just got dressed.

08:26.636 --> 08:29.334
Don't make me want to go
back to bed again.

08:29.334 --> 08:31.380
Did you see
"The New York Times" today?

08:35.602 --> 08:36.951
You were right, Daddy.

08:36.951 --> 08:39.475
There was an attempt
on Che's life at the UN.

08:39.475 --> 08:42.957
"Bazooka fired at UN
as Cuban speaks."

08:42.957 --> 08:44.262
You may have saved
Malcolm's life.

08:44.262 --> 08:45.568
Yeah, well,
tell him that.

08:45.568 --> 08:47.352
He don't want nothing
to do with me.

08:47.352 --> 08:49.790
Fool's traveling around
the country, giving speeches.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.835
I read about his speech
in Selma.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.968
He's trying to form alliances
with Dr. King.

08:53.968 --> 08:56.797
It's gonna make him even more
dangerous to the government.

08:56.797 --> 08:58.842
Well, Elise, can you talk
some sense into him?

08:58.842 --> 09:01.802
He feels Daddy's criminal record
damages his chances

09:01.802 --> 09:03.194
of forming alliances
with more moderate groups,

09:03.194 --> 09:04.544
and he's right. It does.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.197
You have got to
tell Malcolm

09:06.197 --> 09:08.373
your father is stepping away
from drug dealing.

09:08.373 --> 09:10.158
He is trying to reform.

09:10.158 --> 09:11.942
Doesn't matter
if Daddy reforms.

09:11.942 --> 09:13.640
He is who he is,
and people know that.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.685
I don't give a shit
what they think.

09:15.685 --> 09:19.167
He needs my help,
whether he knows it or not.

09:19.167 --> 09:21.996
Can you get me a meeting
with him?

09:21.996 --> 09:23.606
- For a piece of toast.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.173
You gotta get your own.

09:25.173 --> 09:27.001
Oh, but it tastes so much
better when it's yours.

09:27.001 --> 09:28.045
You could have
took your own.

09:28.045 --> 09:30.395
It's so good!

09:30.395 --> 09:33.050
Alright, here we go.

09:33.050 --> 09:34.791
No, no.
Thank you.

09:34.791 --> 09:36.010
- I-I--
- Your favorite.

09:36.010 --> 09:37.620
No, I don't want it.
I'm full.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.143
- Nice eggplant.
- I'm full.

09:39.143 --> 09:40.667
What are you talking about?
I made it fresh for you.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.233
- Come on, you gotta eat it.
- I don't want it.

09:42.233 --> 09:44.540
Vincent, the thought of you
eating that prison food--

09:45.802 --> 09:47.151
What the hell
are you doing?

09:47.151 --> 09:49.327
- For heaven's sake.
- I told her.

09:49.327 --> 09:51.547
- Come on.
- Where's Stella?

09:51.547 --> 09:54.202
I invited Stella.
She didn't want to come.

09:54.202 --> 09:55.682
Forget Stella.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.422
Stella is being protected
by Colombo, as you asked.

09:57.422 --> 09:59.163
No, I need her here with me now,
you understand?

09:59.163 --> 10:00.817
Vincent, this is
a celebration, okay?

10:00.817 --> 10:02.514
Mm-hmm.

10:02.514 --> 10:03.733
We're gonna talk about
all this other stuff later.

10:03.733 --> 10:05.169
I'm just asking
where my daughter is.

10:05.169 --> 10:06.344
Your daughter
doesn't matter right now.

10:06.344 --> 10:07.737
What?

10:07.737 --> 10:09.086
You were facing
20 years in prison.

10:09.086 --> 10:10.871
You got your lawyer here
to thank, okay?

10:10.871 --> 10:14.091
Well, not just me, but the FBI,
who fucked up your arrest.

10:14.091 --> 10:16.180
Nothing is sweeter
in my profession

10:16.180 --> 10:18.226
than an innocent man
getting off on a technicality.

10:18.226 --> 10:19.619
What'd he say about
she doesn't matter?

10:19.619 --> 10:21.446
To me,
it was God-sent.

10:21.446 --> 10:23.623
The Lord did not want Vincent
to spend another day in jail.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.102
Absolutely.

10:25.102 --> 10:26.756
Hear, hear, everybody.

10:26.756 --> 10:29.454
To my darling husband, Vincent.

10:29.454 --> 10:32.849
We appreciate you being back
and we love you.

10:32.849 --> 10:35.635
<i>- Salut.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.854
The fuck did you say? Huh?

10:37.854 --> 10:39.464
Tell me where the fuck
Stella is,

10:39.464 --> 10:41.249
or I'll put a bullet
in your fucking head.

11:04.359 --> 11:05.969
Welcome back.

11:05.969 --> 11:07.667
Valentine's Day.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.147
Oh, yes.

11:10.147 --> 11:12.410
I got some for Elise.

11:12.410 --> 11:13.673
What, you
trying to show me up?

11:15.326 --> 11:16.980
How's everything here?

11:16.980 --> 11:20.157
Uh, a couple of cars
passed by a few hours ago.

11:20.157 --> 11:24.118
We didn't like the feeling,
but they've been gone for hours.

11:24.118 --> 11:26.076
All quiet.

11:26.076 --> 11:29.253
I'm about to go off shift.
Geoffrey's next on command.

11:29.253 --> 11:30.515
Thank you, brother.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.126
Brother Minister.

11:40.177 --> 11:42.136
For me?

11:42.136 --> 11:43.964
Now for who else?

11:46.618 --> 11:49.534
Oh, they're beautiful.

11:49.534 --> 11:50.840
Mmm.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.537
Girls asleep yet?

11:52.537 --> 11:54.975
I just tucked them in.

11:54.975 --> 11:56.846
If you hurry,
you'll catch them awake.

12:00.589 --> 12:02.678
And Happy Valentine's Day
to you.

12:09.076 --> 12:10.860
Mmm.

12:58.429 --> 13:00.257
It's gonna be okay.

13:00.257 --> 13:02.825
We're gonna be okay.

13:11.442 --> 13:13.923
Are you okay?

13:13.923 --> 13:15.446
Betty and the kids?

13:15.446 --> 13:19.581
Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee
are looking after them.

13:19.581 --> 13:21.278
They're shook up,
but unhurt.

13:21.278 --> 13:23.106
I'm staying here
on my own.

13:25.587 --> 13:27.067
You need to
let me help you.

13:27.067 --> 13:29.025
You understand that, right?

13:29.025 --> 13:32.594
First the fucking UN. Now they
blew up your goddamn house.

13:32.594 --> 13:34.944
I owe you an apology
about the UN.

13:34.944 --> 13:36.859
I read about it
in the paper.

13:36.859 --> 13:39.427
I shouldn't have
pulled my gun.

13:39.427 --> 13:41.081
We're both stubborn,
you and I.

13:43.648 --> 13:46.826
Malcolm, listen to me.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.480
I'm begging you.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.222
Let my men join
your protective detail.

13:52.222 --> 13:55.225
The followers guarding you,
they're not professionals.

13:55.225 --> 13:56.836
Let me protect you.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.969
I'm already
a dead man walking.

13:59.969 --> 14:01.841
There's nothing you
or anyone can do about it.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.843
I don't want to hear
that kind of talk.

14:07.890 --> 14:11.285
I can't lie to you, Bumpy.

14:11.285 --> 14:13.853
I want to live a long life.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.116
I want to enjoy my family.

14:16.116 --> 14:21.773
I want to grow old
with my kids and my wife.

14:21.773 --> 14:24.994
But I can't ignore
my people's suffering.

14:24.994 --> 14:29.520
What I want
doesn't matter anymore.

14:29.520 --> 14:33.916
I accept that I am
gonna be killed.

14:33.916 --> 14:36.484
I've made my peace with it.

14:40.836 --> 14:42.359
Who is it?

14:42.359 --> 14:43.970
It's your father.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.519
Okay.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.402
My darling girl.

15:25.402 --> 15:26.969
Okay.

15:26.969 --> 15:28.928
Hi.

15:31.191 --> 15:32.540
When did you get out?

15:32.540 --> 15:34.759
Yesterday.

15:34.759 --> 15:36.892
I need you to pack up
your things, okay?

15:38.981 --> 15:40.417
You're coming with me.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.680
Wait a minute.
What happened?

15:42.680 --> 15:46.946
Fineman, he got me out
on a procedural technicality.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.948
Now listen, I need you to
come with me now, okay?

15:48.948 --> 15:50.384
Right now.

15:50.384 --> 15:52.081
I'm serious.

15:52.081 --> 15:54.431
I'm not leaving.

15:54.431 --> 15:59.610
You know, I-I don't care
that you ratted me out.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.438
You know, I deserved that.

16:01.438 --> 16:03.614
That's water under the bridge.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.790
You asked Colombo
to take care of me and he did.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.618
Okay, I-I don't want you
talking about him.

16:07.618 --> 16:10.447
At first, I was so mad
that you got a complete stranger

16:10.447 --> 16:12.972
to look after me,
to keep me prisoner here, and--

16:12.972 --> 16:15.104
and you had his goons
follow me everywhere.

16:15.104 --> 16:18.542
Yeah, I did that for you.

16:18.542 --> 16:21.893
I know.

16:21.893 --> 16:26.463
And I'm--
I'm grateful.

16:26.463 --> 16:29.292
I think that you really
did me a favor.

16:29.292 --> 16:31.120
Yeah, so, Stella--

16:31.120 --> 16:33.949
No, let me finish.

16:33.949 --> 16:37.083
Joe trusts me now.
I like working for him.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.562
What do you mean,
working for him?

16:38.562 --> 16:40.956
What are you
talking about?

16:40.956 --> 16:42.566
You don't have to
take care of me anymore.

16:42.566 --> 16:44.133
I'm a grown woman now, okay?

16:44.133 --> 16:46.005
Okay, I need you
to listen good.

16:49.051 --> 16:54.056
Now, Colombo, he ain't gonna
be around too much longer.

16:54.056 --> 16:55.840
Dad--

16:55.840 --> 17:00.062
Now, I need you to come
by my side for your own safety.

17:00.062 --> 17:02.760
Who do you think tried
to kill me in the first place?

17:02.760 --> 17:04.458
One of
the other bosses,

17:04.458 --> 17:06.503
worried that you were
gonna rat them out.

17:06.503 --> 17:09.158
It's alright. I'm out now.
I'll find out who.

17:09.158 --> 17:11.247
Let me save you
the trouble.

17:11.247 --> 17:13.336
It was
Tommy Lucchese.

17:13.336 --> 17:15.860
He was given the job
by your wife.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.083
You're telling me

17:21.083 --> 17:24.695
you're sitting on
50 keys you can't move?

17:24.695 --> 17:27.524
Bumpy Johnson used to handle
the bulk of the distribution.

17:27.524 --> 17:29.613
I can only move two keys
at a time.

17:29.613 --> 17:32.399
I don't know why the fuck
you're so pissed off at him.

17:36.403 --> 17:38.796
Would you like a drink?
A little rum?

17:38.796 --> 17:40.407
Too early for rum.

17:53.942 --> 17:56.640
Bumpy's men ruined my chances
at Che Guevara.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.033
Did you honestly
expect him

17:58.033 --> 18:00.688
to leave his best friend
out to dry?

18:00.688 --> 18:03.865
Is that the kind of loyalty
you prize so highly?

18:03.865 --> 18:07.086
Has he ever fucked you over
on the business side?

18:07.086 --> 18:08.696
No.

18:08.696 --> 18:11.568
Be plenty of opportunities
to get Che Guevara.

18:11.568 --> 18:13.353
In the meantime, we are
making money hand over fist

18:13.353 --> 18:14.745
on this
cocaine operation,

18:14.745 --> 18:19.359
and I suggest you and Johnson
patch things up,

18:19.359 --> 18:21.578
on the business side
at least.

18:21.578 --> 18:23.885
What about Malcolm X?

18:23.885 --> 18:28.150
You gonna leave him alone
because Bumpy said so?

18:28.150 --> 18:31.675
As a matter of fact, I think
Bumpy will be more inclined

18:31.675 --> 18:35.679
to come back
after his friend is gone.

18:35.679 --> 18:37.507
Who's gonna
take care of that?

18:37.507 --> 18:40.728
Eh, plenty of people
want Malcolm X dead.

18:40.728 --> 18:43.252
It just takes
a little inducement.

18:45.298 --> 18:47.865
I respect Malcolm more
than any man on this planet,

18:47.865 --> 18:50.433
but I can't just
sit on my hands.

18:50.433 --> 18:53.523
How are we supposed to guard
this man if he won't allow it?

18:53.523 --> 18:55.612
Well, first off, I got Elise

18:55.612 --> 18:58.615
digging for information on
who bombed his house last night.

18:58.615 --> 19:00.443
You guys will follow up
on any leads.

19:00.443 --> 19:03.707
Second, I want you on him
at a distance

19:03.707 --> 19:05.753
with whatever support you need.

19:05.753 --> 19:07.537
Bumpy,
it ain't gonna be easy.

19:07.537 --> 19:09.800
When I need a motherfucker
for an easy job, I'll find him.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.281
Until then, I got you.

19:15.545 --> 19:17.156
I got some visitors, Bump.

19:26.730 --> 19:30.647
Thank you for agreeing
to see me.

19:30.647 --> 19:33.650
My daughter vouched for you.
That's why you're here.

19:33.650 --> 19:36.262
That's why you're still alive.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.307
I'm aware of that.

19:38.307 --> 19:40.570
Malcolm entrusted you
with his security,

19:40.570 --> 19:42.485
then his house got fire-bombed.

19:42.485 --> 19:43.660
How do I know
you're not behind this?

19:43.660 --> 19:45.009
Daddy.

19:45.009 --> 19:46.750
Elise, please.

19:46.750 --> 19:49.927
This man held a gun to Malcolm,
would've shot him dead.

19:49.927 --> 19:51.668
He's proven his loyalty
to Malcolm.

19:51.668 --> 19:56.934
Elise,
your father's right.

19:56.934 --> 19:59.589
He'd be foolish
to trust me.

19:59.589 --> 20:01.678
But...

20:01.678 --> 20:05.639
I think I know who may have
been behind the fire-bombing.

20:05.639 --> 20:11.471
Brother Clyde Barnes in Newark
told me that plans were afoot.

20:13.821 --> 20:15.866
Malcolm told me
not to protect him.

20:15.866 --> 20:17.346
Surely you know that.

20:17.346 --> 20:19.000
I disagree with that.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.221
You're a follower of Malcolm,
but so quick to disobey.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.700
Yes.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.530
I'm afraid
he's going to die.

20:36.713 --> 20:40.369
And how frequently he has
your daughter by his side...

20:41.936 --> 20:44.199
frightens me even more.

21:01.608 --> 21:04.175
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Stell.

21:04.175 --> 21:05.916
Miss, does that have sugar?

21:05.916 --> 21:07.962
No, there's no sugar.

21:17.537 --> 21:21.192
Is she
just gonna sit there?

21:21.192 --> 21:24.108
Yeah, she ain't
a fucking waitress.

21:24.108 --> 21:25.545
She works for me.

21:25.545 --> 21:28.330
She's safe.

21:28.330 --> 21:32.203
Whatever's said in this room
remains private.

21:32.203 --> 21:35.119
- Of course.
- Yes, of course.

21:37.426 --> 21:39.428
You may or may not
have heard--

21:39.428 --> 21:43.432
That you and Bumpy Johnson
cornered the market on cocaine.

21:44.955 --> 21:47.044
Congratulations.

21:47.044 --> 21:49.133
Yeah, I heard.
It's a small town.

21:50.439 --> 21:55.139
In light of my
current situation,

21:55.139 --> 21:58.360
I may be looking
for a new partner

21:58.360 --> 22:01.711
to distribute
the cocaine.

22:01.711 --> 22:04.453
You fuck me blind
when I bring you in

22:04.453 --> 22:05.976
to meet the Commission

22:05.976 --> 22:09.153
under the most advantageous
terms possible.

22:09.153 --> 22:12.461
Then I come back to you
with another offer

22:12.461 --> 22:14.463
and you turn me down.

22:14.463 --> 22:18.467
Now you expect me to enter
into a business

22:18.467 --> 22:21.383
with questionable
upside potential?

22:21.383 --> 22:23.820
It has upside. Trust me.

22:23.820 --> 22:26.301
How do you know?

22:26.301 --> 22:29.739
If Bumpy Johnson was involved,
that means were was upside.

22:29.739 --> 22:31.654
Mm.

22:31.654 --> 22:35.179
What happened with
you and Johnson anyway?

22:35.179 --> 22:38.487
That's my business,
not yours.

22:38.487 --> 22:39.923
Are you interested?

22:44.319 --> 22:45.799
Whether I am
or whether I'm not,

22:45.799 --> 22:48.845
the terms I originally offered
could never be the same.

22:48.845 --> 22:52.632
No, the terms are going to be
exactly the same,

22:52.632 --> 22:56.331
because I'm about
to tell you

22:56.331 --> 22:59.987
the most valuable part
of this arrangement.

23:02.206 --> 23:03.860
And what's that?

23:03.860 --> 23:08.038
Cocaine is just
a means for me

23:08.038 --> 23:10.998
and you Italians

23:10.998 --> 23:16.482
to take back everything
we fucking lost.

23:21.312 --> 23:24.185
Well, I'm glad
you're finally out, Chin.

23:24.185 --> 23:28.232
Yeah, thank you.
We got a lot to catch up on.

23:28.232 --> 23:30.017
And thank you
for coming by.

23:34.108 --> 23:36.545
Look, now that I'm out,

23:36.545 --> 23:39.809
I expect you and
the other bosses to back me up

23:39.809 --> 23:44.814
when I ask, uh, Colombo
to give me my interests back,

23:44.814 --> 23:46.947
to turn them all over,
every one of them.

23:49.210 --> 23:52.039
Well, when you were away,

23:52.039 --> 23:53.736
it's become a little bit
more complicated.

23:53.736 --> 23:54.911
No, it ain't complicated.

23:54.911 --> 23:56.347
It ain't fucking complicated.

23:56.347 --> 23:58.219
It's simple math, okay?

23:58.219 --> 24:01.918
I installed Joe as the head
of the Profaci Family,

24:01.918 --> 24:05.008
and he's repaying me by trying
to take over fucking Harlem?

24:05.008 --> 24:06.923
Well, when you were away,

24:06.923 --> 24:11.188
Colombo got fucking
Bumpy Johnson to back off.

24:11.188 --> 24:13.452
Yeah, well, we're gonna have
to sort all that shit out

24:13.452 --> 24:14.844
at a fucking sit-down.

24:14.844 --> 24:18.065
Good, Colombo wants
to sit down, too.

24:18.065 --> 24:20.763
He tells me he's got
some big proposal for us.

24:20.763 --> 24:22.417
What's that?

24:22.417 --> 24:23.766
I don't know.

24:27.988 --> 24:29.293
You don't know?

24:29.293 --> 24:30.947
What? It's a secret?

24:30.947 --> 24:32.645
I don't know.

24:35.648 --> 24:37.345
You know what?

24:40.827 --> 24:44.657
I got a secret, something
that you and I can share.

24:46.354 --> 24:47.964
You put a hit out
on my daughter.

24:47.964 --> 24:49.792
- How dare you--
- Shut up!

24:49.792 --> 24:51.490
Shut the fuck up!

24:54.971 --> 24:57.147
Your number-one button man,
Frank Barboza,

24:57.147 --> 24:59.280
he up and left
for Florida the day after.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.934
Come on.

25:00.934 --> 25:04.546
I wonder where he's stayin'.
Should I give him a call?

25:04.546 --> 25:09.769
Listen, when you were away,
your wife came to me, Olympia,

25:09.769 --> 25:11.597
and she told me
your daughter Stella

25:11.597 --> 25:15.122
was gonna testify
against the Lucchese Family--

25:15.122 --> 25:17.646
my fucking family!

25:17.646 --> 25:19.343
I'm sorry.

25:25.567 --> 25:27.264
Alright, alright.

25:27.264 --> 25:30.006
It was
an honest mistake.

25:30.006 --> 25:37.187
My wife, she's--
she seems to be confused.

25:37.187 --> 25:39.755
But I gotta make sure that
you're gonna back me

25:39.755 --> 25:43.019
at that sit-down,
Tommy.

25:43.019 --> 25:44.586
Of-- Of course.

25:44.586 --> 25:49.548
Yeah.

25:53.290 --> 25:54.553
What are--
What are you doing?

25:54.553 --> 25:55.771
- Chin?
- Tommy--

25:55.771 --> 25:57.033
Please!

25:57.033 --> 25:58.208
Let's talk about this.

25:58.208 --> 25:59.993
Please. Let's talk.

26:02.169 --> 26:03.997
You still put a hit
on my daughter.

26:03.997 --> 26:05.564
Please! Please!

26:08.218 --> 26:09.698
You motherfucker!

26:12.788 --> 26:15.312
Alright, get him cleaned up.
Get him the hell out of here.

26:15.312 --> 26:17.576
Somebody get him
some help home, huh?

26:21.667 --> 26:24.713
The Italians will be better
partners than Bumpy Johnson.

26:24.713 --> 26:26.193
Not necessarily.

26:26.193 --> 26:28.325
The Five Families
have broader reach.

26:28.325 --> 26:30.023
They can do serious volume.

26:30.023 --> 26:32.199
And they'll skim
more off the top.

26:32.199 --> 26:35.245
Jose, the Italians don't know
shit about selling cocaine.

26:35.245 --> 26:37.683
They can learn.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.249
We need Johnson.

26:39.249 --> 26:42.426
He fucked me on Che Guevara.
I don't trust him.

26:42.426 --> 26:45.908
We don't need trust
if our interests are aligned.

26:45.908 --> 26:48.911
The problem with Johnson
is he's not afraid of us.

26:48.911 --> 26:53.089
He's got Operation Mongoose
as an insurance policy.

26:53.089 --> 26:54.917
Then what the fuck do we do?

26:54.917 --> 26:59.226
We need to remind him
who is in control

26:59.226 --> 27:02.055
and that there are
consequences to his actions.

27:06.929 --> 27:09.671
Nice view.

27:09.671 --> 27:11.542
Solitude.

27:11.542 --> 27:12.935
Yeah.

27:12.935 --> 27:15.459
I think I had enough of that
in solitary.

27:15.459 --> 27:17.548
Good to be out, huh?

27:17.548 --> 27:19.420
Things have changed.

27:19.420 --> 27:21.640
They have.

27:22.553 --> 27:26.732
I understand you teamed up
with Jose Battle,

27:26.732 --> 27:28.647
but you refused
Colombo. Why?

27:28.647 --> 27:30.649
I'm through with the Italians.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.302
No offense.

27:32.302 --> 27:35.044
And Jose Battle, too.
I'm-- I'm on my own now.

27:35.044 --> 27:37.743
There's no hiding places
for us.

27:37.743 --> 27:39.788
Not even prison.

27:39.788 --> 27:44.314
You wanted to meet.
What's up?

27:44.314 --> 27:47.317
I trust you more than
those greedy bastards

27:47.317 --> 27:49.493
on the Commission.

27:49.493 --> 27:50.973
We had it.

27:50.973 --> 27:52.975
We had it all.

27:52.975 --> 27:58.764
With that last shipment,
we would have dominated Harlem.

27:58.764 --> 28:01.767
Yeah, well,
it didn't work out.

28:01.767 --> 28:06.685
There's another shipment
bigger than the one we had.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.512
Come on. You and I.

28:08.512 --> 28:11.341
Let's handle it.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.520
I can't help you.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.087
Why not?

28:18.087 --> 28:20.699
Malcolm X is in danger.

28:20.699 --> 28:23.179
I gotta save my friend.

28:35.365 --> 28:36.715
Want a smoke?

28:38.238 --> 28:39.761
He a Muslim.

28:39.761 --> 28:41.371
He don't smoke.

28:41.371 --> 28:43.547
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

28:43.547 --> 28:46.289
Don't smoke, don't drink,
no pork.

28:46.289 --> 28:49.728
No pussy.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.120
Is that true?

28:51.120 --> 28:53.035
- Yes, sir.
- Damn!

28:54.558 --> 28:58.824
What the hell is life
worth living then?

28:58.824 --> 29:03.045
There is a great pleasure
in faith, my friends.

29:03.045 --> 29:04.960
In having discipline,
feeling clean,

29:04.960 --> 29:07.484
having pride in yourself.

29:07.484 --> 29:10.183
I love it.
Wouldn't trade it for the world.

29:10.183 --> 29:12.054
Hey, have you ever had
a pulled pork sandwich

29:12.054 --> 29:14.970
with onion at 22 West?

29:14.970 --> 29:16.406
No, I have not.

29:16.406 --> 29:18.365
Then if I was you,
I'd reserve judgment.

29:18.365 --> 29:21.542
Alright, alright.
Leave him alone.

29:21.542 --> 29:24.240
You think that motherfucker
Clyde was behind it?

29:24.240 --> 29:26.416
I don't know.

29:26.416 --> 29:28.375
But I'll find out.

29:28.375 --> 29:30.029
And just so you know,
Brother Clyde thinks

29:30.029 --> 29:33.162
I hate Malcolm
as much as he does.

29:33.162 --> 29:38.341
I have to play along
if I'm gonna learn anything.

29:38.341 --> 29:42.432
If you fuck it up,
we'll get it out of him.

29:49.657 --> 29:52.399
You don't chew
with Frank no more?

29:52.399 --> 29:54.401
- Hey, Stella.
- Yo, Stell.

29:54.401 --> 29:55.837
Hey.

29:55.837 --> 29:58.405
How are you gonna fucking
pay me with that?

29:58.405 --> 29:59.928
I want that
fucking money.

29:59.928 --> 30:03.758
Joe, there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

30:03.758 --> 30:05.542
I think there's
gonna be trouble.

30:05.542 --> 30:08.284
My father's gonna come
gunning for you.

30:09.720 --> 30:12.288
Look, he got sprung
on a technicality.

30:12.288 --> 30:14.464
He's not dumb enough
to try and whack me

30:14.464 --> 30:17.032
while he's still got
a legal situation pending.

30:17.032 --> 30:20.122
I think you should leave town,
just for a little while.

30:20.122 --> 30:22.211
I ain't running
from nobody.

30:22.211 --> 30:24.953
You don't know my father.

30:24.953 --> 30:26.781
I think I do.

30:26.781 --> 30:28.478
I ran Harlem
while he was away.

30:28.478 --> 30:31.264
I provided protection
for his daughter when he asked,

30:31.264 --> 30:33.962
and to thank me,
he sends that fuck-nuts Lombardi

30:33.962 --> 30:35.485
to try and take me out.

30:35.485 --> 30:37.270
Joe, you don't get it.

30:37.270 --> 30:41.013
This isn't about Harlem.
It's about me.

30:46.496 --> 30:49.325
I never should have complained
to Fineman about you.

30:49.325 --> 30:52.502
I'm gonna regret that
'til the day I die.

30:52.502 --> 30:54.504
Hey, Stella.

30:57.116 --> 30:59.858
Listen,
he's your father.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.772
He loves you.

31:01.772 --> 31:03.992
He got misinformation.
That's all.

31:03.992 --> 31:06.516
Look, I'm gonna show him
the utmost respect

31:06.516 --> 31:07.866
at the sit-down
tomorrow night.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.519
It's not love.

31:09.519 --> 31:11.260
It's control.

31:11.260 --> 31:13.001
It's different.

31:17.266 --> 31:20.443
Well, if you wanna leave,
you can.

31:20.443 --> 31:25.361
It's not what I want, but...
I'll understand.

31:27.973 --> 31:30.714
That's not control.

31:30.714 --> 31:32.455
You're right.

31:32.455 --> 31:34.718
It's not.

31:34.718 --> 31:37.634
So what is it, then?

31:37.634 --> 31:39.680
It's the opposite,
I guess.

32:08.622 --> 32:11.755
So how can we help you,
Brother?

32:11.755 --> 32:15.585
I just wish you would have come
to me for help with Malcolm.

32:15.585 --> 32:17.370
I would have made
that plan work.

32:17.370 --> 32:20.939
What, uh--
What plan?

32:20.939 --> 32:23.419
What are you
talking about?

32:23.419 --> 32:24.855
Well, surely
you've seen the news

32:24.855 --> 32:28.294
that Malcolm's house
was fire-bombed.

32:30.992 --> 32:34.343
What makes you think
I had anything to do with that?

32:34.343 --> 32:36.041
I'm sorry. My mistake.

32:38.304 --> 32:40.697
We spoke about this last time.

32:40.697 --> 32:42.786
I offered my help,
Brother Clyde,

32:42.786 --> 32:45.615
with the, uh,

32:45.615 --> 32:47.487
Malcolm problem.

32:49.228 --> 32:50.707
Well, you know
the Dear Holy Messenger

32:50.707 --> 32:53.710
has commanded us
not to harm him.

32:53.710 --> 32:55.408
And for the sake of the press, sometimes

32:55.408 --> 32:57.758
the Dear Holy Messenger
speaks in riddles.

32:57.758 --> 33:01.631
I take the Dear Holy Messenger
at his word.

33:01.631 --> 33:03.894
If I didn't, I'd be no better
than that traitor Malcolm.

33:03.894 --> 33:08.290
You can trust me, Brother Clyde.

33:08.290 --> 33:09.944
I'm on your side.

33:16.820 --> 33:21.173
I hear rumors that
you're helping Malcolm.

33:23.784 --> 33:25.655
That you joined
his mosque.

33:25.655 --> 33:29.485
You told him to get close
with Malcolm,

33:29.485 --> 33:31.009
to be an informant.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.967
Sondra is tired.

33:35.361 --> 33:36.840
So am I.

33:44.848 --> 33:48.069
Have faith in Allah,
Brother Omar.

33:48.069 --> 33:50.680
Malcolm will get exactly
what he deserves.

33:54.119 --> 33:56.860
<i>Salaam alaikum.</i>

33:56.860 --> 33:58.514
<i>Alaikum salaam.</i>

34:04.390 --> 34:07.523
There you are.

34:07.523 --> 34:10.135
I was wondering if you were
ever gonna come home.

34:19.057 --> 34:21.537
Here I am.

34:21.537 --> 34:24.149
Oh.

34:24.149 --> 34:27.543
I wanted it to be
a special night for us.

34:35.029 --> 34:38.902
This came all the way
from Italy just for you.

34:38.902 --> 34:43.168
Isn't it gorgeous?

34:43.168 --> 34:48.695
<i>♪ Honey, won't you hold me?</i>

34:48.695 --> 34:51.698
Do you know what
the best part about it is?

34:55.919 --> 34:59.227
That you get to take it off.

35:15.591 --> 35:17.680
You tried to kill Stella!

35:17.680 --> 35:19.204
No. What are you doing?

35:19.204 --> 35:21.423
You tried to have her killed,
didn't you?

35:21.423 --> 35:23.121
With that pig Lucchese!

35:23.121 --> 35:24.600
Why did you do that?

35:24.600 --> 35:26.124
Why did you do it, huh?

35:26.124 --> 35:28.038
That's my daughter!

35:28.038 --> 35:30.084
You wonder why she never
wanted to come home!

35:30.084 --> 35:33.131
Huh?
What's wrong with you, huh?

35:34.523 --> 35:36.438
That's my daughter!

35:40.703 --> 35:43.228
Listen to me, listen to me,
you are dead to me.

35:43.228 --> 35:45.578
You are dead.

35:55.588 --> 35:58.504
I hate New Jersey.

36:00.810 --> 36:04.162
God, this coffee here stinks.

36:07.252 --> 36:09.384
You want your mommy?
She's right over the bridge.

36:09.384 --> 36:11.212
Why you gotta bring my mama
into this?

36:11.212 --> 36:14.476
Why you have to always find
something to complain about?

36:14.476 --> 36:15.999
You like the coffee?

36:15.999 --> 36:18.176
Fuck no.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.177
That's him.

36:22.049 --> 36:24.182
- Go.
- Yeah.

36:31.319 --> 36:33.234
Okay, okay, okay.

36:33.234 --> 36:35.410
Watch this, watch this.

36:35.410 --> 36:37.630
Ready?
One, two, three.

36:37.630 --> 36:40.198
Boom!

36:43.157 --> 36:44.767
Knocked him out with one blow.

36:44.767 --> 36:48.118
Yeah,
that's Chance's specialty.

36:48.118 --> 36:50.686
Knock a man out,
but keep his brains intact

36:50.686 --> 36:53.341
so when he wakes up,
he talks.

37:03.873 --> 37:05.875
Get us
some cappuccinos, huh?

37:05.875 --> 37:07.529
Yeah, boss.

37:07.529 --> 37:10.532
Grab a chair.

37:15.494 --> 37:18.584
You wanna talk?
Go ahead.

37:20.586 --> 37:22.152
Well, welcome back, Chin.

37:22.152 --> 37:25.634
It's good to see you.

37:29.856 --> 37:33.381
I come to you
out of respect.

37:33.381 --> 37:35.862
I come in peace.

37:35.862 --> 37:38.517
I have a proposition
for you.

37:38.517 --> 37:39.909
Hang on.

37:39.909 --> 37:41.824
Maybe that should wait
for the sit-down.

37:41.824 --> 37:43.652
I know you're angry.

37:48.396 --> 37:51.834
What can I do
to make you realize

37:51.834 --> 37:54.272
that I never betrayed you?

37:55.621 --> 37:57.753
You leave Harlem.

37:57.753 --> 38:01.279
Yeah.

38:06.284 --> 38:09.809
You know, I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

38:11.201 --> 38:16.119
At the risk of annoying
you further, that I can't do.

38:16.119 --> 38:19.079
I got big things planned.

38:19.079 --> 38:22.300
Things I want you
to be a part of.

38:22.300 --> 38:25.215
You made me a boss.

38:25.215 --> 38:28.915
For that,
I'm grateful to you.

38:28.915 --> 38:35.922
So please, tell me, how can
I make peace between us?

38:41.623 --> 38:47.629
My boss, Vito Genovese, you
know, when he went to prison,

38:47.629 --> 38:51.981
he asked me to look after
his affairs, like I asked you.

38:55.158 --> 38:58.466
I was his driver.

38:58.466 --> 39:00.903
Nobody respected me.

39:00.903 --> 39:04.603
Not the other capos, not the
families, let alone the bosses.

39:08.824 --> 39:13.176
Only when they seen
what I do with the liars

39:13.176 --> 39:17.050
and the snakes
and the punks like you...

39:20.401 --> 39:23.839
they learned pretty fast
not to fuck with me.

39:28.322 --> 39:32.021
That's a lesson that
I intend to teach you.

39:40.029 --> 39:44.686
Well, I tried.

40:10.233 --> 40:11.713
Hey, Elise.

40:11.713 --> 40:14.368
I'm sorry, d--

40:38.914 --> 40:41.395
What the fuck is this?

40:41.395 --> 40:47.270
It's a message from me
to your father.

40:47.270 --> 40:49.185
Who the fuck are you?

40:49.185 --> 40:51.710
That's not important.

40:51.710 --> 40:53.973
I want to talk about you...

40:56.105 --> 41:01.023
and how you
are gonna help me.

41:08.770 --> 41:12.470
I understand
you were an addict?

41:14.515 --> 41:16.299
That's ironic,

41:16.299 --> 41:18.563
'cause your father's the biggest
dope dealer in Harlem.

41:18.563 --> 41:19.738
Fuck you.

41:21.348 --> 41:23.306
You kicked it.

41:23.306 --> 41:26.396
That's impressive.

41:26.396 --> 41:27.963
It takes a lot of
willpower to kick.

41:27.963 --> 41:29.617
Let me go.

41:29.617 --> 41:32.533
Please, please.

41:37.320 --> 41:42.500
Your father thinks
he can blackmail me.

41:44.545 --> 41:50.769
You will let him know
that I can make his life

41:50.769 --> 41:54.990
as miserable
as he makes mine.

41:54.990 --> 41:57.166
No, no, no. No, no.

41:57.166 --> 41:58.428
Please, don't!
No, don't!

41:58.428 --> 42:00.953
You son of a bitch!

42:19.580 --> 42:21.930
Minister Malcolm,
we can't wait much longer

42:21.930 --> 42:23.279
or you'll miss your plane.

42:23.279 --> 42:24.803
Sister Elise
is not here yet.

42:24.803 --> 42:26.979
She's supposed to
go with me.

42:26.979 --> 42:28.371
We haven't heard
from her yet.

42:28.371 --> 42:30.548
Well, call around
to everybody we know.

42:30.548 --> 42:32.201
Find out
whatever you can.

42:32.201 --> 42:34.552
We've done that and
we'll continue to, but please.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.031
This is the last flight
to Detroit.

42:36.031 --> 42:37.555
If you miss it, you won't
get there in time

42:37.555 --> 42:39.165
to deliver your speech.

42:57.662 --> 43:00.665
Maybe if I put on a little
music, it'll lighten the mood.

43:00.665 --> 43:03.842
Yeah.

43:03.842 --> 43:05.757
Or maybe you can
just talk to me.

43:09.412 --> 43:11.893
Chin Gigante's
out of jail.

43:11.893 --> 43:14.069
He wants to partner.

43:16.768 --> 43:18.378
And what did you say?

43:18.378 --> 43:19.684
No.

43:19.684 --> 43:22.643
That's a start.

43:22.643 --> 43:25.777
Maybe it's the end.

43:27.300 --> 43:30.999
When you play chess and your
opponent has a better position,

43:30.999 --> 43:32.958
they can attack you
from any direction.

43:35.787 --> 43:40.443
The best defense
is to disengage.

43:40.443 --> 43:42.010
Malcolm's in trouble.

43:42.010 --> 43:43.751
The Italians are gonna
go to war.

43:43.751 --> 43:46.928
I'm pretty sure Jose Battle and
the CIA are gonna come after me.

43:46.928 --> 43:48.626
In chess, you can resign.

43:48.626 --> 43:51.019
Knock over your own king.
Is that not an option?

43:51.019 --> 43:52.542
No.

43:52.542 --> 43:53.761
I need you to
be patient with me.

43:53.761 --> 43:55.633
I don't want to lose you.

43:55.633 --> 43:57.286
At the same time, the moves
that I may have to make

43:57.286 --> 44:00.855
to get out of this game alive,
you may not like.

44:00.855 --> 44:03.510
Well, what exactly
does that mean?

44:06.252 --> 44:09.385
The game I'm in isn't just
about winning.

44:09.385 --> 44:10.778
It's about survival.

44:13.955 --> 44:16.305
I can't do it
without you.

44:26.315 --> 44:28.753
Yeah?

44:28.753 --> 44:31.930
Keep the motherfucker there.
I'm coming.

44:55.693 --> 44:58.826
Alright.

44:58.826 --> 45:05.833
Look, I asked Joe to look after
my interests when I was gone.

45:05.833 --> 45:08.531
I got no grudge about that.

45:10.533 --> 45:14.842
But I'm back now
and I don't need him anymore.

45:14.842 --> 45:16.539
But they do.

45:16.539 --> 45:19.194
Hey, wise guy,
you'll have your turn.

45:19.194 --> 45:20.761
Shut the fuck up.

45:20.761 --> 45:22.328
Go ahead, Chin.

45:22.328 --> 45:25.200
Thank you.

45:25.200 --> 45:29.030
I'm taking control of
the new shipment of heroin.

45:29.030 --> 45:35.863
So if any of youse
have agreements with Colombo,

45:35.863 --> 45:38.823
they no longer matter.

45:38.823 --> 45:41.086
I want Joe the fuck
out of Harlem.

45:43.262 --> 45:44.654
Is that it?

45:44.654 --> 45:46.744
There's one more thing.

45:46.744 --> 45:48.354
If he doesn't want to leave,

45:48.354 --> 45:53.794
I'm gonna force him out,
and I got Tommy backing me up.

45:53.794 --> 46:00.496
So the rest of you, I would
choose your sides carefully,

46:00.496 --> 46:06.328
'cause I still got the largest
family with more soldiers,

46:06.328 --> 46:08.983
and I'm in the mood
to spill blood.

46:08.983 --> 46:11.594
Carlo, may I talk?

46:11.594 --> 46:13.683
Sure.

46:13.683 --> 46:17.426
Chin has accused me
of a lot of things

46:17.426 --> 46:19.733
which we know ain't true.

46:19.733 --> 46:21.256
He's got a grudge.

46:21.256 --> 46:22.431
I'm sure he'll get over it.

46:22.431 --> 46:24.085
Yeah, try me, motherfucker.

46:24.085 --> 46:26.435
Chin, please.

46:28.786 --> 46:33.007
Jose Battle and I
have a plan to give you

46:33.007 --> 46:35.531
something you want
even more than heroin.

46:35.531 --> 46:37.272
Yeah, what the fuck is that?

46:37.272 --> 46:38.665
Havana.

46:40.667 --> 46:44.105
With the help of the CIA, you
can rebuild your casinos there.

46:44.105 --> 46:49.415
And the CIA will protect us
from FBI investigations

46:49.415 --> 46:52.810
while we sell drugs,
including cocaine

46:52.810 --> 46:56.770
and the biggest-ever shipment
of heroin and guns.

46:56.770 --> 46:59.033
And what do we do
in exchange?

46:59.033 --> 47:02.384
What we do best.
Kill people.

47:02.384 --> 47:05.170
Ooh.
That's real gangster stuff.

47:10.828 --> 47:14.092
They ain't got fuckin' no
connections to the fuckin' CIA.

47:16.616 --> 47:18.966
If I may.

47:24.189 --> 47:26.147
Good evening, gentlemen.

47:26.147 --> 47:30.064
Allow me to explain what
your government can do for you.

47:33.763 --> 47:40.509
I am very happy to
be here this evening with you

47:40.509 --> 47:44.818
and thankful for the invitation
to come to Detroit.

47:44.818 --> 47:50.345
It tickles me to be in Michigan,
which I used to call my home.

47:50.345 --> 47:56.874
I was in a house last night
that was fire-bombed-- my own.

47:56.874 --> 47:59.354
What kind of a country are we

47:59.354 --> 48:01.879
where one Black man
is set against another

48:01.879 --> 48:04.272
<i>for the benefit
of the white overlord?</i>

48:04.272 --> 48:06.187
Did you fire-bomb
Malcolm's house?

48:07.058 --> 48:08.320
Go to hell.

48:11.714 --> 48:14.152
It isn't something that
makes me lose confidence

48:14.152 --> 48:18.025
in what I'm doing,
because my wife understands.

48:18.025 --> 48:21.376
I have children from
this size on down,

48:21.376 --> 48:24.553
and even in their young age,
they understand.

48:24.553 --> 48:28.166
<i>And while I wish I could be
a more typical father</i>

48:28.166 --> 48:31.647
<i>and protect them
from every possible danger,</i>

48:31.647 --> 48:36.217
<i>I believe it's more important to
secure for them a better future.</i>

48:36.217 --> 48:39.481
<i>Listen good,
my brothers and sisters,</i>

48:39.481 --> 48:42.702
<i>because the battle lines
are drawn,</i>

48:42.702 --> 48:44.356
<i>and I would not be
overstating things</i>

48:44.356 --> 48:46.401
<i>if I didn't say
it was gonna get ugly.</i>

48:46.401 --> 48:48.403
The fuck is this?

48:48.403 --> 48:49.883
You want to
fight it out here?

48:49.883 --> 48:53.060
I just want my daughter.
Let's go.

48:53.060 --> 48:58.936
Our enemies threaten our lives
and the lives of our families,

48:58.936 --> 49:02.548
but they can't kill
our dignity nor our destiny.

49:02.548 --> 49:05.072
Who set this up?
Who funded it?

49:05.072 --> 49:06.508
I know it wasn't just you.

49:06.508 --> 49:10.599
There was--
There was a man.

49:10.599 --> 49:12.775
A white man.

49:12.775 --> 49:14.952
He didn't tell me his name.

49:14.952 --> 49:16.779
Big fat motherfucker?

49:16.779 --> 49:18.085
Yeah.

49:22.002 --> 49:24.744
<i>I have only ever advocated
for violence</i>

49:24.744 --> 49:27.529
<i>as a means of self-defense,
nothing more.</i>

49:27.529 --> 49:29.401
I don't favor violence.

49:49.769 --> 49:52.990
Let's go. Come on.

49:52.990 --> 49:54.121
What?

49:56.819 --> 49:59.213
I'm sorry, Dad.

49:59.213 --> 50:01.955
I'm staying here with Joe.

50:01.955 --> 50:09.223
Our cause can't be snuffed out,
fire-bombed, or legislated away.

50:09.223 --> 50:14.576
We are all kings, and our
greatness, equality, and freedom

50:14.576 --> 50:18.450
will be won no matter the cost.

50:26.414 --> 50:28.547
Elise! Elise!

50:30.549 --> 50:33.030
Elise! Elise.

50:35.728 --> 50:38.252
Come on, help me get her up!
Help me get her up!

50:38.252 --> 50:40.994
- Come on.
- Let us take her upstairs.

50:40.994 --> 50:42.952
Come on.

50:56.618 --> 51:00.274
What'd you call me here for?

51:00.274 --> 51:02.929
I reconsidered
your proposal.

51:05.584 --> 51:08.282
Let's take back Harlem.
