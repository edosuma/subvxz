00:22.967 --> 00:25.924
<i>Every journalist
is searching for that one story.</i>

00:25.958 --> 00:29.429
<i>The one that defines them,
the one that actually makes a difference.</i>

00:30.696 --> 00:35.434
<i>This is my story, and like
most of the good ones,</i>

00:35.466 --> 00:37.269
<i>it's not the one
I set out to tell.</i>

00:42.307 --> 00:45.677
So we're here outside of Lil
Soundcloud's place in Atlanta, Georgia.

00:45.710 --> 00:48.847
He bought the house across the street
from his mother's, bulldozed it

00:48.880 --> 00:51.450
and turned it into the biggest
house on the street.

00:51.483 --> 00:56.522
I'm really just here to figure out what's
going on with the allegations against him,

00:56.554 --> 00:58.890
and I'm starting to think
it won't happen.

01:00.292 --> 01:02.194
Hey, I'm Brian,

01:02.228 --> 01:03.328
we DM'd on Instagram?

01:04.396 --> 01:07.600
I was the guy who reviewed
your very first mixtape.

01:07.633 --> 01:09.834
Hey, what's going on?
I'm with Compound.

01:09.868 --> 01:12.437
- We're here to do the interview.
- Oh, yeah, SoundCloud.

01:12.470 --> 01:14.907
Okay. Yeah. That's... He's not
available at the moment.

01:16.574 --> 01:18.276
He's not?

01:18.309 --> 01:20.712
Yeah, let me
close the door and talk to you.

01:20.746 --> 01:23.749
You can't talk about arrests,
you can't talk about his charges.

01:23.782 --> 01:25.450
He's canceling?

01:25.484 --> 01:27.619
He's a platinum
recording artist.

01:27.652 --> 01:30.722
He cancels on God. You're the
fifth one he's canceled on today.

01:32.357 --> 01:33.258
All right.

01:36.562 --> 01:38.831
You shouldn't worry about
it, man. It's hard to get sit-down

01:38.863 --> 01:40.699
interviews with rappers
anyway, dude.

01:43.035 --> 01:47.340
Hey, hey, uh,
you know, it's... it's...

01:48.039 --> 01:50.276
it's been a crazy couple
of months for you.

01:51.643 --> 01:54.681
It's weird. It just seems like everyone
has a take on this except for you.

01:55.648 --> 01:57.515
I think it's fucked up
that people

01:57.548 --> 01:59.584
would judge something that
they don't know anything about.

01:59.618 --> 02:04.456
Your fans don't know anything
either, which is weird because

02:04.490 --> 02:05.824
I feel like they made you.

02:06.725 --> 02:08.661
Look, man,
just give me five minutes.

02:09.662 --> 02:12.532
You have to give someone
a chance to tell your story.

02:16.567 --> 02:18.303
It's not gonna happen, man.

02:20.406 --> 02:22.508
- Forget it.
- It's not gonna happen, man.

02:26.412 --> 02:29.315
Hey, hey, bro, come on.

02:31.015 --> 02:31.950
He wants to talk.

02:38.323 --> 02:42.560
<i>And that was
it, my first exclusive.</i>

02:44.395 --> 02:45.764
Hello?

02:45.798 --> 02:47.033
Hey, guys?

02:47.066 --> 02:48.634
<i>And soon after,</i>

02:48.667 --> 02:50.836
<i>I became
a featured correspondent.</i>

02:50.869 --> 02:52.571
We're here on the war-torn
Crimean Peninsula,

02:52.603 --> 02:54.839
rebels and nationalists
are engaged in conflict

02:54.872 --> 02:56.876
literally two blocks from us
at this very moment.

02:56.908 --> 02:59.011
Compound sent us down here
for one reason

02:59.043 --> 03:00.545
and one reason alone.

03:00.579 --> 03:02.448
And that's to discover

03:02.481 --> 03:05.584
what the craft beer scene
in Ukraine is all about.

03:05.616 --> 03:07.953
<i>Sure. It was clickbait.</i>

03:07.985 --> 03:09.454
But I was great at it.

03:09.488 --> 03:12.358
So you've chosen
to leave society

03:12.390 --> 03:13.959
and become homeless.

03:13.991 --> 03:16.661
No, no,
it's called urban camping.

03:16.694 --> 03:18.563
It's kind of like the tiny
house movement except...

03:18.597 --> 03:20.433
Yeah, but it's like
so much more sustainable.

03:20.466 --> 03:22.401
- Way more sustainable.
- Yeah.

03:22.434 --> 03:23.936
<i>And I covered any
story they sent me on.</i>

03:23.968 --> 03:25.905
We're in the heart
of Williamsburg. And today,

03:25.937 --> 03:29.875
I'm going to be learning how
to make artisanal antibiotics.

03:29.907 --> 03:32.345
<i>This wasn't journalism
as I'd imagined it,</i>

03:32.377 --> 03:34.113
<i>but I was new
and making a name for myself.</i>

03:34.145 --> 03:36.548
Well, each of these pills
is handcrafted,

03:36.581 --> 03:38.450
so they're different sizes.

03:38.483 --> 03:41.386
It's their flaws
that make them beautiful.

03:41.419 --> 03:43.655
<i>But how many times could
I spin a story out of nothing?</i>

03:43.688 --> 03:47.793
So you are the world's
first CBD oil...

03:47.825 --> 03:48.995
Cryptocurrency.

03:50.561 --> 03:53.065
So, it's a CBD oil
cryptocurrency.

03:56.101 --> 03:58.104
Hey, Brian, Brian.

03:58.137 --> 04:00.005
Yeah, and like we don't really
like need much more than this.

04:00.037 --> 04:01.840
Like we have, like, each other.

04:01.874 --> 04:03.842
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And drugs and like...

04:03.876 --> 04:05.478
Brian, come back.

04:05.511 --> 04:08.114
Hey, Brian,
this is an active war zone.

04:10.649 --> 04:12.018
Man, I hate learning shit.

04:12.984 --> 04:16.620
<i>I was stuck and my career
was going nowhere.</i>

04:16.654 --> 04:18.757
In recent years,
a controversial new figure

04:18.790 --> 04:20.892
has emerged in the South
Appalachian Foothills.

04:22.794 --> 04:24.629
Bigfoot.

04:24.662 --> 04:26.431
And whether or not you believe
the creature exists,

04:26.465 --> 04:30.068
what's undeniable is the impact
it has on local culture.

04:30.102 --> 04:33.072
This week, I'll be joining
local Bigfoot enthusiasts

04:33.104 --> 04:37.643
to examine the evidence,
explore recent sightings

04:37.676 --> 04:40.479
and find out about
the Bigfoot community.

04:40.511 --> 04:43.048
Because this is news.

04:50.688 --> 04:52.558
<i>That's Zach, my producer.</i>

04:52.590 --> 04:55.059
<i>We've worked together for years
and he runs the camera,</i>

04:55.092 --> 04:56.761
<i>even when I don't want him to.</i>

04:56.794 --> 04:58.062
what's going on, dude?

04:58.095 --> 04:59.131
You ready to do this?

05:00.164 --> 05:02.768
- Yeah, are you?
- Yeah.

05:02.801 --> 05:03.736
I got you a coffee.

05:05.102 --> 05:08.139
Are you excited
for the Bigfoot story?

05:08.172 --> 05:09.074
Oh hell no.

05:11.242 --> 05:13.545
Then why are you
in such a good mood?

05:16.515 --> 05:18.217
All right.
Don't tell anyone this,

05:18.249 --> 05:21.586
but I think Shane's considering
me for a broadcast position.

05:21.619 --> 05:23.155
- Wait, really?
- Yeah.

05:23.188 --> 05:25.191
I mean,
they've been developing that,

05:25.224 --> 05:28.894
like, investigative show
for a while.

05:28.926 --> 05:30.629
And now that Celeste is gone...

05:31.996 --> 05:34.066
- Dude, do you think?
- Yeah.

05:34.099 --> 05:36.001
I mean, nobody puts out
the level of content

05:36.034 --> 05:38.738
that we do, even with the
garbage leads they send us on.

05:40.004 --> 05:41.973
Dude, that would be awesome.

05:44.809 --> 05:47.745
Do you remember how much we used
to love working here?

05:47.778 --> 05:50.115
And now I'm just so glad to be
moving on to something else.

05:53.951 --> 05:56.488
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

06:00.859 --> 06:05.498
What do you think about calling the
show Uncovered with Brian Emond?

06:05.530 --> 06:08.733
Oh hell yeah,
that would be sick.

06:08.766 --> 06:12.737
Dude, if we got to go do a broadcast
show together, it'd be awesome.

06:15.273 --> 06:18.244
- I mean we would be still.
- Yeah. Yes.

06:18.277 --> 06:21.046
I... they have, like,
broadcast producers,

06:21.078 --> 06:23.114
but I'd be able to get you over
there eventually.

06:24.683 --> 06:27.520
- Oh.
- I would, I'm going to work to get you over there.

06:27.552 --> 06:28.253
Of course.

06:29.621 --> 06:31.123
Oh, that's our ride.

06:34.092 --> 06:35.828
Wait, Brian, dude.

06:35.861 --> 06:38.631
- Don't ditch me.
- What?

06:38.664 --> 06:40.633
<i>Zach was in
his own head again.</i>

06:40.665 --> 06:42.567
<i>I wasn't ditching anybody,</i>

06:42.600 --> 06:46.170
<i>and even if I had ditched him,
I wouldn't have noticed.</i>

06:46.203 --> 06:49.140
By the way,
this is all of our schedule,

06:49.174 --> 06:52.044
itinerary, background research,
everything that we're going to need.

06:52.076 --> 06:53.177
Cool.

06:53.210 --> 06:55.146
Hey, are we waiting on someone?

06:55.179 --> 06:58.216
- We're taking more people to the airport.
- Who?

06:58.249 --> 07:00.318
Some dirty money man
or something?

07:00.352 --> 07:01.854
I don't know.
It's three or four people.

07:01.886 --> 07:03.788
Oh, shit.

07:03.821 --> 07:07.191
Oh, yeah, we in my hometown
Brooklyn, New York,

07:07.225 --> 07:09.727
and this week
we trading the Big Apple

07:09.761 --> 07:11.664
for the birthplace of poutine.

07:11.696 --> 07:14.866
That's right.
We going to Canada, baby, on...

07:26.645 --> 07:29.080
What up? It's your boy
Dirty Dolla $ign$.

07:29.114 --> 07:30.749
And I got the whole
crew with me.

07:30.782 --> 07:33.919
We got MC Slip-Slap,
Rawdog Nintendo

07:33.951 --> 07:36.154
and of course, White Morpheus.

07:36.188 --> 07:38.991
And oh s###, we got ourselves
a special guest.

07:39.023 --> 07:41.994
- It's Compound's Brian Emond.
- Hey.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.830
Just on my way to the airport.

07:44.862 --> 07:46.698
Us too. But of course

07:46.732 --> 07:49.268
not before we get a little
something-something

07:49.301 --> 07:51.236
- on the way.
- What? No.

07:57.208 --> 07:59.143
See, this is how we do it.

07:59.176 --> 08:01.847
Stick the McChicken
inside a McChicken.

08:01.879 --> 08:04.048
That's Brooklyn style, baby.

08:04.082 --> 08:07.853
You got to try this, my man,
I don't know if I want to be on the show.

08:07.886 --> 08:10.756
I don't think you want to be
on your show either.

08:10.789 --> 08:12.758
What? what...
why would you say that?

08:12.790 --> 08:15.226
I can tell,
we watch Compound every day.

08:15.260 --> 08:18.230
- You definitely slipping.
- And you know what else I noticed?

08:19.164 --> 08:21.967
- What?
- We forgot fries.

08:26.203 --> 08:28.674
Oh, man. So salty.

08:28.707 --> 08:34.078
- This tastes like a...
- in the summertime late in the day.

08:34.111 --> 08:38.082
Acting like some yard work or
something, you know.

08:38.115 --> 08:41.019
- But Brian as a guest in this segment...
- I'm not the guest.

08:41.052 --> 08:44.956
...I need to know, you, me,
we both prolific journalists, you know.

08:45.856 --> 08:48.993
- Technically.
- What do you look for in a story?

08:49.027 --> 08:52.431
Well, I guess I try to find
something unconventional

08:52.464 --> 08:55.434
- and then see if it's worthy of...
- Dope.

08:55.466 --> 08:57.702
That's... that's dope.

08:57.735 --> 08:59.203
You know what I'm looking for?

08:59.236 --> 09:03.007
A... crack
after some yard work?

09:03.041 --> 09:06.244
Yes. Always, my man.

09:06.277 --> 09:08.880
- Yeah.
- And that makes for a good story?

09:08.913 --> 09:11.249
Oh right, stories.

09:11.282 --> 09:12.950
That's simple, my man.

09:12.984 --> 09:16.388
I get in the s### deep.

09:16.421 --> 09:18.123
You know,
people in this industry,

09:18.156 --> 09:21.193
they think they always
know what the story is.

09:21.225 --> 09:24.864
But truthfully, sometimes the real
story is right in front of you.

09:25.830 --> 09:27.432
That's pretty insightful.

09:27.465 --> 09:30.068
Yeah, and if you got a good
guest, all you got to do

09:30.101 --> 09:33.438
- is be genuinely interested in the topic at hand.
- Totally.

09:33.471 --> 09:36.207
Like one time I was interviewing
the Mayor of New York and...

09:36.240 --> 09:39.010
And that's sometimes the cards
that you dealt, you know.

09:39.043 --> 09:42.246
For example, take me, I have to
interview the Mayor of Canada,

09:42.279 --> 09:44.282
- Justin Trudeau.
- Well, he's not a mayor.

09:44.316 --> 09:46.951
- He's a prime minister.
- Right, but they on the metric system,

09:46.984 --> 09:48.887
so it's basically like a mayor.

09:48.920 --> 09:50.989
No, it's basically
like a president.

09:51.022 --> 09:53.792
- Oh, s###, really?
- Oh, shit.

09:53.825 --> 09:56.061
Wait, hold on, I thought you did,
like, a show about food and weed,

09:56.094 --> 09:57.896
why are you interviewing
someone like that?

09:57.928 --> 10:00.098
Oh, this is for my new show.

10:00.132 --> 10:03.035
Yeah, Shane got me doing some
new documentary series.

10:03.067 --> 10:06.270
He want me getting into some
investigative journalism.

10:06.303 --> 10:08.906
Wait so,
you got the broadcast spot?

10:08.940 --> 10:11.744
Yeah, he said I was
the obvious choice.

10:11.777 --> 10:16.047
They said I need a show
that gets in the s###.

10:16.080 --> 10:19.250
But you know what I need?
I need.

10:20.351 --> 10:22.353
I need...

10:22.387 --> 10:24.455
Oh God.

10:24.489 --> 10:27.225
Okay. All right,
excuse me, excuse me.

10:28.826 --> 10:30.229
Wait, wait.

10:31.463 --> 10:33.499
I thought you needed
a ride to the airport.

10:33.532 --> 10:35.935
No, we're good.
We'll just, uh...

10:37.002 --> 10:38.871
just walk.

10:38.903 --> 10:41.907
<i>So they gave my dream job
to some stoner moron...</i>

10:41.940 --> 10:43.275
I told you to stop rolling.

10:43.307 --> 10:45.277
<i>...and left me with Bigfoot.</i>

10:57.888 --> 11:01.125
So we're here in Georgia at the largest
Bigfoot convention in the Southeast.

11:01.158 --> 11:02.527
It's taking place on...

11:06.431 --> 11:07.499
Smiling?

11:12.103 --> 11:15.440
I'm not... I'm not pissed off.
I'm very serious.

11:15.473 --> 11:17.176
Like, I'm... I'm grave.

11:22.547 --> 11:24.282
No.

11:24.316 --> 11:26.018
So, we're here in Georgia
where there's already been

11:26.051 --> 11:27.518
1,000 opioid related deaths

11:27.551 --> 11:30.888
this year alone,
which is actually true.

11:30.922 --> 11:34.359
It's actually such a problem that criminal
organizations are moving into town and setting up

11:34.392 --> 11:38.130
shop just to supply drug
addict communities, right?

11:38.162 --> 11:39.364
That's interesting.

11:39.397 --> 11:41.200
That's interesting stuff.

11:41.233 --> 11:43.301
But not as interesting
as Bigfoot.

11:43.335 --> 11:45.604
We're in Georgia, the largest
Bigfoot convention in the Southeast.

11:45.637 --> 11:47.573
We're going to go around,
ask some locals what they have to say

11:47.605 --> 11:49.040
about the big man himself.

11:50.642 --> 11:51.811
Okay, we got it.

11:53.979 --> 11:55.280
Okay. We'll do drone shots
or something.

11:55.312 --> 11:56.381
I don't care.

12:01.319 --> 12:05.123
<i>It was a festival, tents,
people and a terrible band.</i>

12:05.156 --> 12:08.292
<i>While I could be in Yemen reporting
on how humanity can be found</i>

12:08.325 --> 12:10.896
<i>in the darkest of places,
I'd much rather be here,</i>

12:10.928 --> 12:14.298
<i>shopping for novelty t-shirts.
And while it was truly a blast,</i>

12:14.331 --> 12:16.534
<i>my producer demanded
we follow his itinerary</i>

12:16.567 --> 12:19.437
<i>and meet a self-proclaimed
master of camouflage.</i>

12:26.677 --> 12:29.981
Oh! Oh! Oh!

12:30.014 --> 12:31.949
What is that?

12:31.983 --> 12:33.886
That is my secret.

12:34.652 --> 12:37.122
See, what I do
is I use the urine

12:37.154 --> 12:39.624
to mask my scent.
It's pretty subtle.

12:39.657 --> 12:41.960
You think so?

12:41.993 --> 12:43.896
See, we smell too good,

12:43.928 --> 12:46.898
and that's why no one's ever
found him yet.

12:46.931 --> 12:50.902
Okay, so you, like,
spray it all over yourself.

12:55.407 --> 12:59.378
So, has that worked for you?

12:59.411 --> 13:02.047
Hell yeah, it works for me.
I love it.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.516
No, I mean,
have you found Bigfoot?

13:06.350 --> 13:07.219
No.

13:09.086 --> 13:11.155
<i>This was shaping
up to be a thrilling story.</i>

13:11.189 --> 13:13.992
- <i>Next we talk to the cops.</i>
- A bunch of crap.

13:14.024 --> 13:16.160
Okay, locals just believe that
shit because of the internet.

13:16.194 --> 13:18.297
Look, it's just
a bunch of bears.

13:18.330 --> 13:20.465
Then where are the bear
attacks happening?

13:20.498 --> 13:23.167
Okay. I'm going to tell you the
same thing I told the last reporter.

13:23.200 --> 13:26.638
Okay, the only stories we have is of
hikers getting too close to wildlife.

13:26.671 --> 13:29.407
Okay. So if you go in those woods,
you stay on those trails, you hear me?

13:29.441 --> 13:31.243
A lot of
private property up there,

13:31.276 --> 13:33.111
people start getting in trouble
when they lose their way.

13:33.143 --> 13:36.148
- Wait, what does that mean?
- Ten-Four officer en route.

13:36.181 --> 13:37.917
Means watch out for bears
on your own.

13:39.283 --> 13:40.551
Woods aren't my precinct.

13:50.494 --> 13:52.664
Cool, it's bears.

13:54.099 --> 13:56.234
We flew out
from Brooklyn to cover bears.

13:57.601 --> 14:00.137
<i>But things
were about to get lit.</i>

14:00.171 --> 14:02.040
<i>Just 45 minutes outside of town</i>

14:02.072 --> 14:04.275
<i>was a one-man
Bigfoot hunting Army.</i>

14:04.308 --> 14:07.611
<i>Jeff Stevenson is a living
legend in the Bigfoot community.</i>

14:07.644 --> 14:12.484
<i>Jeff rose to prominence in 2014 after
documenting one of the most controversial,</i>

14:12.517 --> 14:14.585
<i>paranormal sightings
of our time.</i>

14:14.619 --> 14:16.721
<i>Known as the Blue Ridge tape.</i>

14:16.754 --> 14:19.390
<i>The video shows a shadowy figure
moving through the trees</i>

14:19.423 --> 14:21.759
<i>at night, but what's most
notable about the incident</i>

14:21.792 --> 14:25.263
<i>is what happened the next day
when Jeff returned to the site</i>

14:25.296 --> 14:28.734
<i>and found what he claims as evidence
that Bigfoot is using tools.</i>

14:30.435 --> 14:33.071
Y'all, welcome
to the Cryptic Castle.

14:33.104 --> 14:35.007
- How's it going?
- Good.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.375
Wait a second.
Aren't you guys the ones

14:36.407 --> 14:38.643
who made the little
SoundCloud piece?

14:38.676 --> 14:40.311
Yeah.

14:40.345 --> 14:42.080
Yeah, you know about our
hip-hop documentaries.

14:42.113 --> 14:43.582
Oh hell yeah.

14:43.614 --> 14:46.183
Oh man, all that
slow-mo hip-hop,

14:46.216 --> 14:48.686
trap king, everybody's vaping.
It's my shit.

14:48.720 --> 14:52.758
<i>It was a look I'd seen before.
GameStop Indiana Jones,</i>

14:52.791 --> 14:57.095
<i>the brown jacket, the leather hat,
the magnetic cellphone holster.</i>

14:57.128 --> 15:00.632
<i>Of all the people we met, Jeff somehow
seemed like the biggest waste of my time.</i>

15:00.665 --> 15:02.100
So I'll show you
around a little bit.

15:02.133 --> 15:05.470
We've got the mega
futon right here.

15:05.503 --> 15:08.073
Um, this is actually
my ex's idea to get this.

15:08.105 --> 15:10.708
She said she needed
some more space.

15:10.742 --> 15:15.747
I think what she really wanted was
just a space that didn't have me in it,

15:15.779 --> 15:18.182
which is why she moved
two counties over.

15:19.216 --> 15:22.086
- Anyways, what was your question?
- I hadn't asked one.

15:22.119 --> 15:23.721
Okay, let's go. Here you can see

15:23.754 --> 15:25.823
some of the samples we've
collected out in the field.

15:25.856 --> 15:28.092
We do most of the testing
here in our own lab,

15:28.125 --> 15:31.196
but sometimes we send them away
for further research.

15:31.229 --> 15:34.132
It's what happens when you get
too close to the truth.

15:34.165 --> 15:37.636
Uh, right here, you've got some of
my better photos of the Bigfoot.

15:37.668 --> 15:42.273
Some of them taken by my crew, a lot of
the better ones taken by yours truly.

15:42.306 --> 15:44.442
Now, where is Bigfoot
in these photos?

15:44.475 --> 15:47.345
Oh, well, in this one,
he's right there.

15:48.546 --> 15:50.816
- Right where?
- Right there.

15:52.182 --> 15:55.486
You got to squint and get back
in there but he's right there.

15:55.519 --> 15:56.654
Okay.

15:56.687 --> 15:58.389
Oh, this is a great photo.

15:58.422 --> 16:00.859
I actually won the lasso
competition in Raven County

16:00.892 --> 16:04.095
- in 2006, I think.
- What's this one?

16:04.128 --> 16:05.596
Oh, that's, um...

16:07.632 --> 16:09.568
that was of me and my ex.

16:09.600 --> 16:13.438
Uh, it's...
it's pretty complicated.

16:14.772 --> 16:16.141
She, uh...

16:17.709 --> 16:19.078
she doesn't want to be with me.

16:20.144 --> 16:24.215
But like I... I very much
want to be with her.

16:24.249 --> 16:28.753
So, like I said,
complicated, but y'all...

16:28.786 --> 16:31.590
y'all don't need to know about that.
I'm... I'm sorry, I didn't...

16:31.623 --> 16:33.624
mean to make it weird.

16:33.657 --> 16:34.792
It's not.

16:37.861 --> 16:40.197
- Let's move on. Move on.
- Okay.

16:40.230 --> 16:42.900
And this right here is what I like
to call our display model cast.

16:42.933 --> 16:45.436
We've done a lot more but that's
the one in the best condition.

16:45.470 --> 16:49.541
- What about this?
- That's actually the crown jewel of my Bigfoot collection,

16:49.574 --> 16:52.477
if you will. That's why I have
it twined up, to wear on

16:52.509 --> 16:54.345
- expeditions for good luck.
- Okay.

16:54.378 --> 16:56.815
So for many non-believers,
they submit that

16:56.848 --> 17:00.719
these chance encounters are
actually a result of bear attacks.

17:00.752 --> 17:03.588
It's completely natural for
people to question something

17:03.620 --> 17:06.424
they don't fully understand.
The general public has done it

17:06.455 --> 17:08.358
throughout scientific history.

17:08.392 --> 17:11.762
But Bigfoot is the next step
in human evolution.

17:11.795 --> 17:13.830
And if evolution
has taught us anything,

17:13.865 --> 17:17.903
it's that life will not be
contained, life breaks free.

17:17.935 --> 17:20.739
It expands through territories,
it crashes through barriers

17:20.771 --> 17:22.941
painfully
or maybe even dangerously,

17:22.973 --> 17:25.777
but, well, there it is,

17:25.810 --> 17:27.412
- life finds a way.
- Life finds a way.

17:28.879 --> 17:30.614
From <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

17:30.648 --> 17:31.782
No, I just...

17:32.783 --> 17:33.752
I just made that up.

17:34.953 --> 17:36.754
This is our little staging area,

17:36.788 --> 17:39.191
as you can see we use
topographical maps,

17:39.224 --> 17:42.894
we... we go so far off trail,
we can't use any sort of conventional map.

17:42.926 --> 17:45.362
Um, I'm really sorry
about the mess.

17:45.396 --> 17:49.935
My cousin Sid is crashing with me right
now, his, uh, old lady kicked him out.

17:49.967 --> 17:51.902
So he's here to take over
the family business.

17:51.936 --> 17:54.371
- Oh, Sid!
- Come on. Come on, boy.

17:54.405 --> 17:55.540
- Sid, Sid.
- Get down.

17:55.572 --> 17:56.707
No, Sid, Sid.

17:56.741 --> 17:59.211
What the fuck? Sid!

17:59.244 --> 18:01.213
- Sid, hey!
- <i>As I watched two full grown men wrestle</i>

18:01.245 --> 18:03.447
<i>each other to the floor,
I began to wonder...</i>

18:05.015 --> 18:06.383
<i>...was it too late
to go back to school?</i>

18:06.417 --> 18:07.351
Sid...

18:08.785 --> 18:10.487
Sid?

18:10.521 --> 18:12.791
Okay,
so I think he passed out,

18:12.823 --> 18:15.493
so let's just continue the tour.

18:15.525 --> 18:17.196
But very quietly.

18:17.928 --> 18:20.364
You know, I am really glad
y'all boys came out.

18:20.398 --> 18:22.867
I don't get visitors much.
Well, here she is.

18:22.899 --> 18:24.936
I know she looks kind of small
but she'll fit the two of you

18:24.968 --> 18:27.471
- real comfortably.
- Fit us for what?

18:27.504 --> 18:28.639
This is your tent.

18:29.807 --> 18:32.277
For the field
expedition tonight.

18:32.310 --> 18:35.280
- The what?
- The field expedition?

18:36.046 --> 18:38.850
- It was on the itinerary.
- What itinerary?

18:38.882 --> 18:41.285
Remember,
I gave you itinerary back in Brooklyn?

18:44.821 --> 18:46.858
Jeff, would you
give us a moment?

18:46.890 --> 18:48.526
Yeah, absolutely. No problem.

18:56.667 --> 18:58.302
Did Shane approve this?

18:58.336 --> 19:00.639
Yeah, dude.
Remember, I told you about this.

19:01.571 --> 19:06.011
Okay, so we just got some rando though.
Like, who the hell is this guy?

19:06.043 --> 19:09.313
- You don't know who the Cryptic Commander is?
- The what?

19:11.983 --> 19:14.286
What is up, YouTube?

19:14.319 --> 19:16.454
Welcome back to another episode
of <i>Paranormal Pursuits.</i>

19:16.486 --> 19:19.556
It's your boy,
the Cryptic Commander.

19:19.590 --> 19:21.859
Now, I know what you all
are thinking,

19:21.892 --> 19:24.461
"Cryptic Commander,
did you finally domesticate

19:24.494 --> 19:27.698
the Jersey Devil,
and find out that it's lactation

19:27.732 --> 19:29.934
is a good source of protein?"

19:29.966 --> 19:32.936
Nah, but that would
be hella tight.

19:32.969 --> 19:35.472
And besides,
I don't need anymore protein,

19:35.505 --> 19:39.476
I get all that I need
from Alpha Snacks.

19:39.510 --> 19:41.813
<i>And again,
a bullshit assignment.</i>

19:41.846 --> 19:44.015
Shane. Hey, what's up?
What's going on?

19:44.048 --> 19:47.051
I was looking over
the itinerary,

19:47.084 --> 19:48.719
and I think there's been
a little bit of a mistake.

19:48.753 --> 19:51.023
It says that we're
staying with the subject.

19:54.658 --> 19:59.297
Okay. Yeah. Just typically we do
a hotel for something like this.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.803
I get that, and I'm not trying
to be a diva here or anything,

20:05.837 --> 20:08.640
but I just usually need
a little bit of space

20:08.673 --> 20:11.009
to spread out
my notes and write.

20:20.952 --> 20:24.489
Okay, so you want me to... Shane?

20:25.790 --> 20:27.892
Shane! Shane, come...

20:27.925 --> 20:30.729
I heard the cops
gave you a hard time.

20:30.762 --> 20:33.431
No. No, it was okay.

20:33.464 --> 20:36.634
Oh that's how they fucking act,
make you feel like it's okay.

20:36.667 --> 20:39.036
They don't got
no respect for anybody.

20:40.670 --> 20:41.572
Yeah.

20:43.140 --> 20:46.076
Yeah. My old lady
told me that she was

20:46.109 --> 20:48.479
sick of me, she kicked me out.

20:48.513 --> 20:49.947
I got one too many Dewey's.

20:51.682 --> 20:54.051
I still remember
that cop look on his face.

20:54.084 --> 20:55.453
He wrote me a ticket.

20:59.557 --> 21:01.793
Man, if I had a chance,
I'd take a swing at that cop.

21:02.926 --> 21:06.563
Yep, I fucking hit
any cop I could, man.

21:06.597 --> 21:07.499
I'll kill him.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.135
Okay.

21:12.703 --> 21:14.638
Yeah, you all right.

21:14.671 --> 21:16.975
You all right, boy,
you want something to drink?

21:17.007 --> 21:18.809
No, I'm... I'm good, dude.

21:18.842 --> 21:21.412
I'll get you a beer,
I'll get myself one too.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.415
Fuck, I don't get
any reception out here.

21:23.447 --> 21:24.416
What's going on?

21:24.448 --> 21:25.682
I'm done.

21:25.715 --> 21:27.084
I'm done with this
fucking story.

21:27.984 --> 21:29.954
But our flight
isn't for three more days.

21:29.986 --> 21:32.390
Which is why I'm gonna
buy one for tonight.

21:33.457 --> 21:34.559
What's the problem?

21:35.659 --> 21:37.528
The problem is they sent us
out here to do a story

21:37.561 --> 21:40.197
with a Bigfoot whisperer
and his drunk fucking cousin.

21:40.231 --> 21:42.567
They sent us out to Georgia
to do another non-story.

21:44.068 --> 21:46.471
Man, what the fuck
has been up with you lately?

21:47.605 --> 21:50.809
- What?
- We're supposed to be partners on this, okay.

21:50.841 --> 21:53.043
This is my fucking job, Brian.

21:53.077 --> 21:55.980
You're supposed to be
the host and I'm the producer,

21:56.013 --> 21:58.817
and you are just not
giving a fuck about this.

22:01.886 --> 22:03.922
You're just going to ditch me
like you always do.

22:07.090 --> 22:09.960
<i>Tensions were high
and the story was trash,</i>

22:09.994 --> 22:12.062
<i>but that wasn't a good reason
to piss off my producer.</i>

22:12.096 --> 22:13.432
Hey!

22:15.867 --> 22:17.034
I'm sorry about earlier.

22:18.168 --> 22:21.038
I don't mean
to get mad like that

22:21.071 --> 22:25.209
and I recognize that I'm not the only
one working on something like this.

22:26.244 --> 22:28.879
You know, it's too late to go
back to the city anyways, so...

22:31.182 --> 22:32.217
I'll stay tonight.

22:34.017 --> 22:36.753
Really? You'll take
this seriously.

22:36.786 --> 22:37.955
Yeah, on one condition.

22:38.923 --> 22:40.492
What?

22:40.524 --> 22:42.726
I'm sleeping indoors.

22:42.760 --> 22:46.898
And look at this,
technically it's indoors.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.499
- Huh?
- You boys sure you want to put

22:48.532 --> 22:49.734
your tent right on this path?

22:49.766 --> 22:51.936
I mean you are basically asking

22:51.968 --> 22:54.805
for unwanted animal attention
later tonight.

22:54.839 --> 22:57.809
So, we should smash ours up
in the trees like that?

22:58.708 --> 23:01.946
Oh, heck yeah. That's the safest
place to crash, Scout's honor.

23:02.980 --> 23:04.682
Uh...

23:04.715 --> 23:06.751
I think we'll take
our chances out here.

23:06.783 --> 23:08.486
All right, suit yourself.

23:18.596 --> 23:19.664
Where's he going?

23:20.997 --> 23:22.699
<i>I was starting to lose
what little hope I had this trip</i>

23:22.733 --> 23:24.002
<i>was worth our time.</i>

23:25.168 --> 23:28.005
<i>But that night
something happened.</i>

24:10.615 --> 24:11.950
- Brian, are you awake?
- Sh.

24:18.990 --> 24:20.025
Brian...

24:22.126 --> 24:23.828
What are you doing?

24:23.860 --> 24:25.996
I think there's
something out there.

24:27.130 --> 24:30.234
The woods, Brian,
things make noise.

24:30.266 --> 24:33.604
Yeah, but it's...
it's like it's a person walking.

24:36.206 --> 24:38.142
Keep... keep the light
out of here.

25:13.977 --> 25:16.914
- Dude, what the fuck was that?
- That's what I'm talking about.

25:41.272 --> 25:42.773
Dude, give me the camera.

26:14.370 --> 26:16.306
Do you think
it's still out there?

26:16.340 --> 26:17.375
I don't know.

26:22.312 --> 26:24.081
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
turn the light off.

26:49.039 --> 26:50.842
Dude.

26:50.875 --> 26:51.810
Did you see that?

26:52.810 --> 26:54.145
Yeah, dude, that was...

26:54.177 --> 26:56.414
Ah, shit, the battery.

26:57.814 --> 26:58.850
Did you see that?

26:59.917 --> 27:00.819
Yeah.

27:11.995 --> 27:13.363
Here, give me the camera.

27:50.167 --> 27:51.869
Something is watching us.

27:53.838 --> 27:54.839
What?

28:20.598 --> 28:22.600
Shit, the battery,
it's the battery, here, give it to me,

28:22.632 --> 28:24.367
- give it to me.
- Why don't you ever have

28:24.400 --> 28:26.303
- any extra batteries on hand?
- I can't see anyth...

28:30.206 --> 28:34.044
Okay, new battery,
let's do this.

28:36.347 --> 28:39.117
Dude, he's not in here.
I don't know... Jeff!

28:40.984 --> 28:44.054
I guess someone
has trashed our campsite.

28:45.321 --> 28:49.960
<i>The attack kept us up all
night, we heard noises for hours.</i>

28:49.994 --> 28:53.898
<i>And even though we could hear a creature
moving towards us through the camp,</i>

28:53.930 --> 28:58.869
<i>like so many Bigfoot hunters before us, we
fail to capture any substantial evidence.</i>

29:00.103 --> 29:01.538
Holy shit.

29:03.006 --> 29:07.978
What? What?
Let's go check this out.

29:08.012 --> 29:12.383
Okay, so whatever it was, it was big
enough to crack a skillet in half.

29:15.019 --> 29:18.623
So our campsite has been trashed,
and last night my producer and I

29:18.656 --> 29:21.292
heard someone or something
outside of our tent

29:21.324 --> 29:24.461
going through the campsite.
And whatever it was,

29:24.494 --> 29:27.631
it was large enough...
to do this.

29:29.366 --> 29:31.234
Uh, it's pretty scary stuff.

29:31.267 --> 29:34.137
Guess you could say we're
grateful to have... whoa!

29:34.170 --> 29:37.374
- Good morning, everybody.
- Where were you?

29:37.407 --> 29:40.077
Oh, well, I checked on y'all on your
tent earlier and you were still asleep.

29:40.109 --> 29:42.045
So I just went
for a morning hike.

29:42.079 --> 29:43.981
You left us
after all that happened?

29:44.013 --> 29:46.484
Well, yeah.
I knew I was coming back.

29:46.516 --> 29:49.152
- Dude, I was calling out your name, man.
- Look...

29:51.221 --> 29:53.624
- I was taking a shit.
- With the camcorder.

29:53.657 --> 29:54.926
Yeah.

29:57.628 --> 30:00.196
So, here we are
in the North Georgia mountains

30:00.230 --> 30:02.300
hunting the Sasquatch himself.

30:02.332 --> 30:04.134
And I already know
what you're thinking.

30:04.167 --> 30:07.037
"But Jeff, you always hunt down
the spookiest apparitions

30:07.071 --> 30:09.607
that the government
doesn't want us to know about."

30:09.639 --> 30:12.142
Duh! Yeah?

30:12.176 --> 30:14.512
Well, this episode's
a little bit different

30:14.544 --> 30:17.281
'cause your boy, Jeff Boyardee,

30:17.313 --> 30:20.484
is going to be the subject
of a Compound documentary.

30:20.516 --> 30:22.419
Good on me!

30:22.453 --> 30:24.254
Jeff, where are you?

30:27.190 --> 30:29.459
<i>He wasn't perfect.
But whatever we saw,</i>

30:29.493 --> 30:31.494
<i>he was the only person
who could help us find it.</i>

30:31.528 --> 30:35.132
Jeff, we need you to show us
more of what we heard last night.

30:35.165 --> 30:41.071
Really? Because I thought I was just a Sasquatch
whisperer with a drunk fucking cousin.

30:43.040 --> 30:44.709
We heard something for sure.

30:46.342 --> 30:51.014
I don't know if I believe everything I've
heard you say, but this is something,

30:51.048 --> 30:53.618
and we need to use this documentary
to get to the bottom of it.

31:00.057 --> 31:03.094
And the only way to do that
is by telling...

31:04.194 --> 31:05.396
your story.

31:08.765 --> 31:09.734
Really?

31:11.201 --> 31:14.172
My story? Like Lil SoundCloud.

31:17.206 --> 31:18.109
Yeah.

31:24.048 --> 31:28.219
<i>Welcome to North Georgia.
Two hours outside of the nearest city,</i>

31:28.252 --> 31:31.489
<i>We're located in the dense forests
of the Appalachian Foothills.</i>

31:31.522 --> 31:33.456
<i>If Atlanta
is where the players play,</i>

31:33.490 --> 31:37.762
<i>then this is where
the players do meth.</i>

31:37.794 --> 31:40.398
<i>And Jeffrey Stephenson
is its trap King.</i>

31:40.430 --> 31:43.700
<i>A full-time Bigfoot investigator
and cryptozoologist,</i>

31:43.734 --> 31:46.404
<i>Jeff has written five books
about paranormal research.</i>

31:46.436 --> 31:49.240
<i>Three of which have been dedicated
solely to Bigfoot field work</i>

31:49.273 --> 31:52.076
<i>and Sasquatch law, and he's even
a featured contributor</i>

31:52.109 --> 31:54.345
<i>on several
paranormal news shows.</i>

31:54.378 --> 31:57.080
<i>But today he's here to give me
the lowdown on Bigfoot.</i>

31:57.113 --> 31:59.783
I mean, I've been
writing and researching

31:59.817 --> 32:02.653
Bigfoot for about
almost 20 years now.

32:02.686 --> 32:05.222
I led my first Bigfoot
expedition when I was nine

32:05.254 --> 32:07.291
as a part of the Webelo Scouts.

32:07.323 --> 32:11.227
In that time, I've managed to
write some pretty successful books.

32:11.261 --> 32:12.463
And that is of course...

32:13.996 --> 32:16.633
before my marriage to Jen fell apart,
and you know, we lost the deposits

32:16.667 --> 32:21.237
- on, like, the caterer and the vendors and...
- Whoa, whoa, stop, stop.

32:21.271 --> 32:24.207
It's fine. Just like,
let's talk about Bigfoot.

32:24.241 --> 32:27.511
All right, so the trick to a good
Bigfoot call is you really want to get it

32:27.543 --> 32:30.214
down deep in your guts
from your diaphragm.

32:43.494 --> 32:46.830
What we have is a piece
of authentic Bigfoot fur.

32:46.863 --> 32:49.365
You can tell because of
the coloring and the markings.

32:49.398 --> 32:52.669
You know, a lot of Bigfoot
hunters kind of hate this job

32:52.703 --> 32:54.772
'cause all you're doing
is picking up little pieces,

32:54.804 --> 32:58.141
but I mean, I'm really good
at picking up pieces,

32:58.175 --> 33:00.711
you know, it's pretty similar when
I had to pick up all the pieces

33:00.744 --> 33:02.346
of my life after Jen left.

33:05.648 --> 33:08.886
Well, knocking's a lot like
a dolphin echolocation.

33:08.918 --> 33:12.355
And it's also our greatest indication
that the Bigfoot uses tools.

33:12.388 --> 33:14.190
It might say, "Hey...

33:15.492 --> 33:16.894
...I'm in this area."

33:16.926 --> 33:19.664
Or it could even be like
three Bigfoot hunters.

33:25.601 --> 33:30.273
Some notes, you do sound a little
bit more like a lady Bigfoot.

33:30.307 --> 33:32.510
Imagine from deep down
in your nether loins.

33:33.709 --> 33:36.479
Feel free to ask me
any questions. I'm an open book.

33:36.513 --> 33:41.185
Do you think that your obsession with
Bigfoot tore apart your relationship?

33:41.217 --> 33:42.719
Shh...

33:46.790 --> 33:48.459
Do you hear that?

33:49.659 --> 33:51.128
- No.
- I don't.

33:52.963 --> 33:54.831
- There's nothing, I'm sorry. Let's keep moving.
- Okay.

33:54.865 --> 33:56.467
You know, all these
other Bigfoot hunters.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.636
They're just out here
to make money, man.

33:58.668 --> 34:01.237
You know, they came out here and
they collected their Bigfoot tracks,

34:01.271 --> 34:03.474
before they knew what they had,
they had printed it,

34:03.506 --> 34:04.941
packaged it and slapped it
on the side

34:04.975 --> 34:06.811
of a lunch box,
and now they're selling it.

34:07.744 --> 34:11.315
They're selling it.
And they were so preoccupied

34:11.348 --> 34:13.317
with whether or not they could,
they never...

34:13.350 --> 34:14.886
stopped to think if they should.

34:15.953 --> 34:17.922
- <i>Jurassic Park.</i>
- Oh.

34:17.955 --> 34:19.857
No, remember, I told you
I've never seen that movie.

34:25.761 --> 34:28.498
- Do you carry a firearm?
- No, never.

34:28.531 --> 34:31.568
Never. I would never carry
any type of weapon

34:31.601 --> 34:33.270
or... or any
sort of thing like that.

34:33.302 --> 34:36.873
But especially not a gun.
Bigfeet hate guns.

34:36.906 --> 34:38.841
So you'd say
Bigfoot is anti-gun.

34:38.875 --> 34:40.911
Well, you know, don't go
putting words in my mouth.

34:40.944 --> 34:43.447
The Squatch respects
the Second Amendment.

34:43.480 --> 34:45.349
He just would never
own a gun personally.

34:47.551 --> 34:48.886
This is probably
one of my favorite devices.

34:48.918 --> 34:52.288
This is a personal water
filtration system.

34:52.322 --> 34:53.958
I mean, you can filter
anything with that.

34:53.991 --> 34:57.460
I've even filtered
and drank pee with it before.

34:57.493 --> 34:59.562
- Drank pee with it?
- Yeah.

34:59.596 --> 35:02.699
- With this one?
- Well, yeah, I don't need two water filters.

35:02.732 --> 35:05.235
- All right, that's good. We'll move on.
- Okay.

35:07.871 --> 35:09.974
Does everyone
out here drink piss?

35:10.007 --> 35:13.344
- What was your question again?
- Oh, I was going to ask, do you think that

35:13.377 --> 35:15.947
- the cause of your relationship...
- Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

35:20.484 --> 35:22.018
You hear that, right?

35:22.052 --> 35:24.288
- No.
- Okay. Okay.

35:25.422 --> 35:28.391
Let's keep moving. what's funny is
a lot of people get lost out here

35:28.424 --> 35:30.627
when they try to
stay on the trail.

35:30.661 --> 35:33.364
That's why I'm happy I'm an Eagle
Scout, I really never get lost.

35:33.397 --> 35:35.366
Oh my god.
You're an Eagle Scout.

35:35.398 --> 35:37.500
Yeah, like, haven't I told
you guys like five times?

35:39.402 --> 35:42.438
How would one communicate
with its family if it was, say,

35:42.471 --> 35:44.708
- a domestic matter?
- Oh, okay, um...

35:49.045 --> 35:51.314
It sounded a
lot like three hunters.

35:51.348 --> 35:54.685
Well, I mean,
who's the cryptozoologist here?

35:54.717 --> 35:57.020
This is a glyph.

35:57.054 --> 35:58.522
- What is?
- This.

36:00.389 --> 36:02.558
- This?
- Yeah, the... this

36:02.592 --> 36:05.029
and that and the that.
A glyph is a way that

36:05.061 --> 36:08.464
a Bigfoot communicates
with other Bigfoots.

36:08.498 --> 36:14.038
So you think that this pile of sticks
that potentially could have fallen here...

36:14.071 --> 36:18.007
- Yeah.
- ...is Bigfoots speaking to each other?

36:18.040 --> 36:21.711
- Yeah. This is a glyph.
- <i>Our guide was a nice guy...</i>

36:21.744 --> 36:24.013
Okay, that's crazy 'cause I'm
seeing another one right there.

36:24.047 --> 36:26.382
<i>...but it was getting hard
not to call out his bullshit.</i>

36:26.415 --> 36:28.585
Do you want to hear knocking
for shut the fuck up?

36:32.022 --> 36:34.657
So your relationship,
it was probably torn apart...

36:34.690 --> 36:35.692
Shut up!

36:38.027 --> 36:39.629
Because I'm pretty sure...

36:41.598 --> 36:45.002
we're in the path of a Bigfoot right
now and we don't want to disturb it.

36:46.036 --> 36:48.505
<i>While Jeff showed us some
pretty cool tricks of the trade,</i>

36:48.538 --> 36:51.507
<i>we hadn't seen anything that explained
what had happened the night before.</i>

36:51.540 --> 36:53.109
<i>And even though
the sun was setting,</i>

36:53.143 --> 36:54.945
<i>our guide insisted
on taking us to a lake</i>

36:54.978 --> 36:56.380
<i>that he had discovered.</i>

36:56.413 --> 36:58.081
Look. It's just so cool

36:58.114 --> 36:59.750
and so beautiful, and I know
you guys are going to love it.

36:59.782 --> 37:01.618
I promise, we're really close.

37:02.953 --> 37:04.888
<i>Cool being a relative term here.</i>

37:04.920 --> 37:07.657
<i>So I wasn't holding my breath.</i>

37:07.690 --> 37:11.127
<i>But just as our guide left
sight, the unexpected happened.</i>

37:13.897 --> 37:15.732
Are you... do you see that?

37:18.034 --> 37:21.003
Come here. You got this, right?

37:21.036 --> 37:23.773
<i>And there it was.
Undeniable evidence</i>

37:23.806 --> 37:25.642
<i>that we were
in Bigfoot's backyard.</i>

37:27.344 --> 37:31.782
<i>I've seen a lot in my time as a journalist,
but nothing as unexpected as this.</i>

37:31.815 --> 37:35.786
<i>This morning I had my doubts,
but now things were different.</i>

37:35.819 --> 37:39.489
<i>I held in my hands,
Bigfoot's DNA.</i>

37:39.522 --> 37:41.725
<i>This could be the sample
we needed to prove</i>

37:41.757 --> 37:43.560
<i>that religion is wrong...</i>

37:43.592 --> 37:45.395
- Bryan, what are you doing?
- ...that we evol...

37:45.429 --> 37:47.898
- Collecting some evidence.
- That's not evidence.

37:47.931 --> 37:49.800
That's my shit
from this morning.

37:51.067 --> 37:52.735
This isn't Bigfoot scat?

37:52.768 --> 37:54.804
No, absolutely not. Brian, look.

37:54.837 --> 37:56.806
There's my toilet paper
right there.

37:58.208 --> 38:01.110
<i>To say it had been a
long day was an understatement.</i>

38:01.143 --> 38:02.679
Well, I'm gonna need
another pencil.

38:03.947 --> 38:05.649
<i>And we were losing light fast.</i>

38:05.681 --> 38:07.450
<i>So Jeff's lake
would have to wait.</i>

38:07.484 --> 38:10.119
So I know your instinct
is to camp right here

38:10.152 --> 38:13.823
in this clearing, but to avoid
another situation like last night,

38:13.857 --> 38:16.627
why don't y'all go ahead and shove
that tent right in those vines.

38:26.603 --> 38:30.574
<i>Jeff had gone to sleep
which finally gave my producer and I</i>

38:30.607 --> 38:32.509
<i>a chance to catch up.</i>

38:32.542 --> 38:34.076
How do you think today went?

38:34.110 --> 38:36.080
Went okay.
Got some pretty good footage.

38:37.013 --> 38:39.516
I cannot get a read on this.

38:39.549 --> 38:44.721
This guy though. I mean, like,
is he mad that someone caught him in a lie

38:44.753 --> 38:47.525
or is he mad that
no one believes him...

38:48.625 --> 38:51.027
I don't know.
It's just too much.

38:51.060 --> 38:53.896
"Uh, are you guys aware that
this is actually the spot where Bigfoot

38:53.929 --> 38:55.165
first became an Eagle Scout."

38:56.534 --> 39:00.070
If you make fun of Bigfoot again,
I'm going to tell Jeff's fiance.

39:07.543 --> 39:09.212
Hey, I'm sorry
I was such a prick yesterday.

39:11.181 --> 39:12.816
It's okay.

39:12.848 --> 39:13.984
I... I get it.

39:15.618 --> 39:17.487
If anyone deserves
to work in broadcast...

39:18.255 --> 39:19.123
it's you.

39:20.790 --> 39:22.525
You do all the work,
you put everything together,

39:22.558 --> 39:24.060
and I didn't even
read the itinerary.

39:27.029 --> 39:27.931
Thanks.

39:31.534 --> 39:34.605
I guess I just had this idea of the
sort of work that we should be doing,

39:35.304 --> 39:36.573
and I think we deserve it.

39:39.174 --> 39:42.812
But maybe it's, like,
on me, because I'm building up

39:42.846 --> 39:46.917
this idea of some sort of
grand investigator.

39:46.949 --> 39:49.219
Like I think I'm going to be
Carl Bernstein or something.

39:51.955 --> 39:54.223
I just, I know I'd do anything
to be given a shot

39:54.257 --> 39:55.559
at a real story.

39:57.060 --> 39:59.563
And when I see other people
getting that shot, it just...

40:03.967 --> 40:05.903
It just feels like we're
never going to make it.

40:10.040 --> 40:14.311
Well... why don't
we just get over it?

40:14.344 --> 40:18.849
I mean who gives a shit, we work
at a big New York media company

40:18.882 --> 40:22.586
that just made a rapper their prime
time anchor, so maybe we don't know

40:22.618 --> 40:23.887
what the fuck they want.

40:26.623 --> 40:29.059
Maybe we should just be happy.

40:29.092 --> 40:32.829
I mean, like, it is kind
of fun, a little bit.

40:32.862 --> 40:37.768
I mean, how many reporters from The Guardian
get to go out into the woods in Georgia

40:37.801 --> 40:41.672
and follow around an Eagle Scout
Bigfoot weirdo for a week?

40:43.206 --> 40:44.575
And it could be a lot worse.

40:46.042 --> 40:47.143
I could be doing this alone.

40:49.179 --> 40:50.915
So I'm glad you're
out here with me.

40:54.717 --> 40:55.719
Me too.

40:58.989 --> 41:00.090
Hey, guys.

41:01.123 --> 41:03.593
I'm also glad
you're out here with me.

41:08.230 --> 41:09.799
I'm gonna go to bed.

41:09.833 --> 41:11.301
<i>Day three with my producer,</i>

41:11.333 --> 41:14.605
<i>who, like I said,
rolls on everything.</i>

41:14.638 --> 41:17.674
Oh shit, man. Got to get some
B-roll of me waking up.

41:19.141 --> 41:21.011
Hold on, let me focus it.
Hold on.

41:21.043 --> 41:21.946
Yeah, man.

41:22.946 --> 41:25.081
Got to make sure
this looks good.

41:25.114 --> 41:27.984
Get some sweet B-roll
of me checking my texts.

41:30.353 --> 41:32.856
Awesome, no reception.

41:39.029 --> 41:41.331
His tent's empty. Looks like
we're on our own again.

41:42.799 --> 41:46.802
- Maybe he's up the trail.
- Yeah, probably taking another shit for me to find.

41:53.442 --> 41:55.978
Oh, here he is.

41:56.011 --> 41:59.715
Jeff, it's that lake
you were talking about.

41:59.748 --> 42:02.185
Yeah, see, I told you all
I wasn't lost.

42:02.217 --> 42:03.886
Wow.

42:03.920 --> 42:06.290
- This is really beautiful.
- It is, isn't it.

42:07.290 --> 42:08.190
Wow.

42:10.326 --> 42:14.097
So, um, most of the lakes
in Georgia are man-made reservoirs,

42:14.130 --> 42:16.767
but this is actually one
of the natural ones.

42:16.799 --> 42:18.435
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

42:18.467 --> 42:20.337
A lot of people don't know
this, but over time,

42:20.369 --> 42:23.005
a lot of lakes just disappear.

42:23.038 --> 42:25.074
You know, part of it's because
of global warming

42:25.107 --> 42:28.177
but for the most part it's just
the natural order of things.

42:29.212 --> 42:32.049
It's why when I come out and look
out over something like this,

42:32.081 --> 42:35.384
I just want to breathe it all in
because, potentially,

42:35.418 --> 42:37.287
I could be the last person
to see it.

42:40.989 --> 42:43.393
- You know, one time back in the Boy Scouts we were...
- Jeff...

42:44.360 --> 42:45.262
you know...

42:47.063 --> 42:49.833
this is... this is a pretty chill
life you lead.

42:51.101 --> 42:54.204
You live in a beautiful place,
you hike for a living,

42:54.237 --> 42:55.272
you write books.

42:56.172 --> 42:57.975
I mean,
it's not glamorous but...

42:59.942 --> 43:01.177
you got a cool life.

43:03.212 --> 43:04.113
Thanks.

43:06.049 --> 43:07.417
You know, when
I'm out by the water like this,

43:07.449 --> 43:09.085
I just feel so much more calm.

43:10.219 --> 43:12.388
And that, like, I'm making all
the right decisions in life

43:12.422 --> 43:15.257
and that this Bigfoot
hunting obsession

43:15.290 --> 43:18.696
isn't just going
to be a waste of my time.

43:19.996 --> 43:24.267
That video I took years ago,
it turned me from a nobody to a somebody,

43:24.299 --> 43:27.970
but it completely ruined
my relationship with Jennie.

43:28.003 --> 43:31.373
She just couldn't understand how a
grown man wanted to spend all his time

43:31.406 --> 43:33.342
in the woods hunting
for a Sasquatch.

43:34.377 --> 43:39.248
She said it was strange
and she said that I was a loser,

43:39.281 --> 43:41.283
and then her mom called me
a loser too,

43:41.317 --> 43:43.821
and then eventually my mom
joined their side as well.

43:44.987 --> 43:46.889
Sure, I'm a single guy

43:46.922 --> 43:51.194
living in a bachelor pad with
my semi violent, drunk cousin,

43:51.226 --> 43:53.763
but it's all worth it.

43:53.797 --> 43:57.199
It's all worth it because Bigfoot is real
and you guys are making this documentary

43:57.232 --> 43:59.335
about me, and I'm not a loser.

44:02.538 --> 44:03.773
Fuck you, Mom.

44:06.976 --> 44:11.448
At least that's what I think about
when I look at a sunrise.

44:11.480 --> 44:12.381
How about you?

44:13.982 --> 44:15.852
Well, gonna go pack.

44:25.460 --> 44:28.297
Do you think he realizes
how much he puts on people?

44:28.331 --> 44:30.300
<i>Jeff was just being honest,</i>

44:30.333 --> 44:32.869
<i>which was something I hadn't
done with my producer, Zach.</i>

44:34.337 --> 44:37.107
What? Job offer?

44:37.139 --> 44:38.241
PBS?

44:39.141 --> 44:41.511
Was it my phone?
Oh, shit, reception!

44:48.317 --> 44:50.186
Look at what
this piece of shit sent us.

44:51.888 --> 44:54.223
Hey, do you think they got together and
he, like, ate out Justin Trudeau's asshole?

44:56.025 --> 44:59.362
And my battery is dead. Awesome.

44:59.395 --> 45:03.366
Just enough to get a photo
from that piece of shit.

45:03.398 --> 45:05.469
If y'all need to make
a phone call, I got reception.

45:07.002 --> 45:09.272
- No, we're good.
- All right.

45:10.339 --> 45:14.543
So, we're out in the woods,
day two, North Georgia Foothills.

45:14.576 --> 45:16.612
We've seen some pretty
interesting stuff.

45:16.645 --> 45:20.516
Our guide has decided
to take us to a spa...

45:20.549 --> 45:22.985
Hey, Jeff.
You're in the shot, Jeff.

45:23.018 --> 45:24.286
You're in the shot.

45:24.319 --> 45:26.189
- Sorry.
- It's all good.

45:28.324 --> 45:30.527
- Am I clear?
- Yeah.

45:30.560 --> 45:34.364
So, we're out here in the woods,
day two, North Georgia.

45:34.397 --> 45:39.436
We haven't seen Bigfoot, but we have seen
some things here that are somewhat...

45:40.502 --> 45:42.504
Jeff, Jeff.

45:42.538 --> 45:44.907
Oh my gosh,
are you guys still filming?

45:44.940 --> 45:46.542
I'm sorry. I'll just...
I'll just get behind the camera.

45:46.576 --> 45:47.476
Okay.

45:49.478 --> 45:51.881
So we're out here in the woods,
day two, North Georgia.

45:51.915 --> 45:54.183
- We're not seeing Bigfoot but...
- Hey, Zach, will you cut for just a second.

45:54.217 --> 45:57.487
Brian, something's got to be done
about your hair. You just look crazy.

45:57.520 --> 45:59.623
Let me just get that real quick.

45:59.656 --> 46:01.123
There you go, much better.

46:05.427 --> 46:07.931
- So we're out in the woods day two...
- And action.

46:09.565 --> 46:12.202
So, we're in
the fucking Woods. Cut.

46:15.170 --> 46:17.473
<i>While our
first day had been fun,</i>

46:17.507 --> 46:19.976
<i>we were beginning to wonder
if our guide was reliable.</i>

46:21.576 --> 46:23.212
Jeff, are we going
the right way?

46:23.246 --> 46:25.449
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Um, it should just be...

46:26.616 --> 46:29.052
this way? Yeah, it's this way.

46:32.188 --> 46:33.990
Does he know
which way he's going?

46:34.022 --> 46:35.358
I mean, he knew
how to get to the lake.

46:36.259 --> 46:38.228
Whatever. This is good footage.
Just keep rolling.

46:40.196 --> 46:42.398
<i>While I thought we were
headed in the right direction,</i>

46:42.431 --> 46:45.567
<i>I was about to find out
how lost we really were.</i>

46:45.601 --> 46:48.071
<i>And while I was looking
for a figurative sign,</i>

46:48.103 --> 46:50.239
<i>I didn't expect
to find a literal one.</i>

46:50.272 --> 46:51.207
What's that?

46:54.509 --> 46:57.212
Jeff, what's that?

46:57.246 --> 46:59.349
This... this isn't right.

46:59.382 --> 47:03.485
Okay. So do we double back to the
trail that we were on earlier?

47:03.518 --> 47:05.487
No. No, no, no, no.
The direction is right,

47:05.520 --> 47:08.390
the compass has been
pointing north all day.

47:08.424 --> 47:10.627
Wait. Have you been holding your
compass like that the entire time?

47:10.659 --> 47:12.295
Yeah.

47:12.328 --> 47:14.630
It's right next to your
magnetic belt clip.

47:14.663 --> 47:17.100
- No wonder it always says north, dumbass.
- Shit.

47:17.132 --> 47:19.601
- You seriously didn't realize that?
- Brian, I...

47:19.634 --> 47:22.571
<i>Typically, situations like
this would cause other people to panic.</i>

47:22.605 --> 47:25.976
<i>But as an experienced reporter,
I know how to keep a level head.</i>

47:26.009 --> 47:29.545
<i>All the situation required was
some patience and some planning.</i>

47:29.578 --> 47:31.080
- ...Brian.
- What trail are we on?

47:31.114 --> 47:32.715
It's probably not listed.

47:32.748 --> 47:35.317
- It's a map from a hotel lobby!
- I don't care!

47:35.351 --> 47:38.221
Tell me what trail we're on or we are
going to stay lost up here forever.

47:38.253 --> 47:40.322
Your compass clearly
doesn't fucking work.

47:40.355 --> 47:42.658
- Neither does your Eagle...
- Hey, guys...

47:44.192 --> 47:46.328
What's that thing up
in the brush there?

47:46.362 --> 47:49.398
- What? What's what?
- There's something up there.

47:51.034 --> 47:54.404
<i>But no amount of planning could
have prepared us for what came next.</i>

47:56.438 --> 47:58.074
<i>After a day and a half
in the woods</i>

47:58.107 --> 48:00.009
<i>with our incompetent guide,</i>

48:00.043 --> 48:02.712
<i>my producer and I thought
we were going home empty-handed.</i>

48:02.744 --> 48:06.315
<i>Now, we'd stumbled upon something
bigger than we'd ever anticipated,</i>

48:07.250 --> 48:08.650
<i>and there was no going back.</i>

48:08.683 --> 48:10.353
Holy shit.

48:12.455 --> 48:15.491
Do you think this is one of
those, like, bear attacks?

48:15.525 --> 48:17.793
You think a bear
is capable of this?

48:17.826 --> 48:20.397
Dude...
what, you think it's Bigfoot?

48:21.764 --> 48:23.800
He's got a gun,
it's just like Jeff said.

48:23.833 --> 48:27.103
Yeah, he does have a gun. Brian, sto...
stop getting so close to it.

48:27.136 --> 48:30.672
<i>When we set out this morning,
none of us could've predicted a dead body.</i>

48:30.706 --> 48:33.076
<i>And based on the lack
of decomposition here,</i>

48:33.109 --> 48:35.578
<i>looks like whatever happened
just occurred.</i>

48:35.610 --> 48:38.447
<i>And just by chance, we have...</i>

48:38.480 --> 48:40.116
Oh. Oh, God!

48:40.148 --> 48:41.817
Oh my god.

48:41.851 --> 48:43.553
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

48:43.585 --> 48:45.354
I'm fine.

48:48.690 --> 48:51.127
<i>This body could've
been out here for days,</i>

48:51.159 --> 48:53.696
<i>and if we hadn't stumbled
across it,</i>

48:53.728 --> 48:55.732
<i>who knows how long it would have been...</i>

48:55.764 --> 48:57.500
Oh, god, dude. Jeff!

48:57.532 --> 49:00.170
Oh, I'm not fine. I'm not fine.

49:00.203 --> 49:01.304
Oh, no.

49:02.605 --> 49:04.674
Brian, I... I can't be near this thing, man.

49:04.706 --> 49:06.308
- Whoa, whoa, keep rolling on this.
- Dude,

49:06.342 --> 49:08.211
I can't be near this, dude.

49:08.243 --> 49:09.578
It's a body, man.

49:09.612 --> 49:12.182
You have us in the woods
with a body, man.

49:12.214 --> 49:14.216
Okay, but you remember
what we heard, right?

49:14.250 --> 49:16.152
The other night?
Whatever that was,

49:16.185 --> 49:17.788
clearly we are hot on its trail.

49:18.688 --> 49:20.290
We have to call the cops, man.

49:20.322 --> 49:22.591
W... why? What difference
would that make?

49:22.625 --> 49:24.427
We're two days
out of town right now.

49:24.460 --> 49:26.196
And besides, do you think
you're the first camera man

49:26.228 --> 49:27.330
to see a dead body?

49:28.230 --> 49:29.598
I don't think you get it.

49:29.632 --> 49:31.068
We're in the shit.

49:32.569 --> 49:34.737
- Dude, this isn't worth it, man, I'm turning the camera off.
- No, do not.

49:34.770 --> 49:36.473
- I'm turning the camera off.
- Do not, leave it rolling!

49:36.505 --> 49:38.174
- Leave it on!
- <i>And for the first time ever,</i>

49:38.206 --> 49:40.442
<i>Zach... stopped rolling.</i>

49:44.514 --> 49:47.417
We made the turn
right here, right?

49:47.449 --> 49:51.120
Yeah, I... I think so. That should
be right, because this way is North.

49:51.154 --> 49:54.389
Okay, okay,
so we can take this trail here

49:54.422 --> 49:56.658
and we can hit
the ranger station.

49:56.692 --> 49:58.728
They'll probably have a phone,
we can call back to town,

49:58.761 --> 50:00.362
that'll be way faster
than going back.

50:00.395 --> 50:02.297
Yeah, we... tha... that
might work, but I...

50:02.331 --> 50:05.635
- Brian, I... That map is for tourists.
- It's all we got.

50:05.668 --> 50:07.237
- Okay.
- Let's go.

50:16.212 --> 50:18.748
- Come on!
- We're really doing this?

50:18.781 --> 50:19.683
Yes.

50:22.618 --> 50:23.652
Shit.

50:24.719 --> 50:25.621
Shit!

50:27.556 --> 50:29.692
So, we're two days
into our hike,

50:29.725 --> 50:33.696
we have found a victim
of what we believe to be

50:33.728 --> 50:36.165
a Bigfoot attack
or a bear attack.

50:36.199 --> 50:39.601
Either way, our best hope is probably
to head to this hiking outpost

50:39.634 --> 50:41.337
and radio back to town.

50:41.369 --> 50:43.705
We have a pretty
hefty hike ahead of us,

50:43.739 --> 50:46.676
and we are feeling it
in the heat of this afternoon.

50:46.708 --> 50:50.312
<i>According to our guide, we were only a
few hours away from the ranger station</i>

50:50.346 --> 50:52.181
<i>and could soon
alert the authorities.</i>

50:52.214 --> 50:54.750
<i>By radioing in,
we avoid going back to town,</i>

50:54.784 --> 50:58.555
<i>and we can keep searching for
whatever stormed our campsite.</i>

50:58.587 --> 50:59.922
<i>And whatever killed that man.</i>

51:05.328 --> 51:07.263
- Did we go the right way?
- Yeah, we...

51:07.295 --> 51:09.498
we took the turn
that your map said to.

51:09.531 --> 51:12.201
This is like, like an abandoned
hippie commune.

51:12.235 --> 51:13.670
Yeah, that is
what it looks like.

51:15.871 --> 51:19.842
- Are we lost?
- No! No, no, no, no, no, no, I... I know where to go from here.

51:19.875 --> 51:22.512
We just need to keep going
southwest into town.

51:22.545 --> 51:25.748
Man, Jeff. I pulled out the map, I asked you
if that's where we turned and you said yes!

51:25.781 --> 51:27.616
Brian. How many times
do I have to tell you

51:27.650 --> 51:30.453
that that map is for day hiking
hipster pieces of trash

51:30.485 --> 51:33.455
from Brooklyn who just want
to come in for Instagram pics?

51:33.489 --> 51:36.960
Wow, you know, I didn't realize the
guy who brags about never getting lost

51:36.993 --> 51:39.261
would get us so fucking lost.

51:39.295 --> 51:40.863
- Let me guess, you learn that shit in...
- Look, just give me

51:40.895 --> 51:43.699
a couple minutes to get
my bearings straight, all right.

51:43.732 --> 51:46.568
And I'll get us into town.
I think it's only, like,

51:46.601 --> 51:49.504
a half a mile from that...
that ranger station.

51:51.973 --> 51:53.509
<i>We'd been through a lot.</i>

51:56.011 --> 51:59.281
<i>But after seeing firsthand what can
happen to hikers in these mountains...</i>

52:00.650 --> 52:03.520
<i>I couldn't help but wonder,
were we next?</i>

52:05.321 --> 52:07.023
<i>Jeff had gotten us this far,</i>

52:07.056 --> 52:09.025
<i>and his training as an Eagle
Scout had come in handy</i>

52:09.058 --> 52:11.860
<i>more than once. But I was
beginning to ask myself</i>

52:11.893 --> 52:15.464
<i>if maybe an Eagle Scout
is just an adult</i>

52:15.498 --> 52:17.734
<i>who stayed in Scouts too long.</i>

52:19.902 --> 52:23.005
<i>But after insisting that we were
at least close to our outpost,</i>

52:23.038 --> 52:25.908
- <i>our guide formulated a plan.</i>
- So, look.

52:26.808 --> 52:28.977
It's probably the best bet
for us to just go ahead

52:29.011 --> 52:30.746
and set up camp here.

52:30.779 --> 52:32.348
We're running out of daylight

52:32.380 --> 52:34.317
and we know we have
a reliable water source.

52:35.317 --> 52:39.921
But we have about two hours
until full sunset.

52:39.955 --> 52:41.757
So I thought
maybe during that time

52:41.790 --> 52:43.759
I could go
and scout out the area,

52:43.793 --> 52:46.696
and maybe get a better
understanding of where we are.

52:46.728 --> 52:50.032
And while I'm gone,
maybe we could, you know,

52:50.065 --> 52:52.435
set up your tent...

52:52.467 --> 52:58.007
and maybe deal with some of those anger
management issues we saw come out earlier?

52:58.040 --> 53:00.509
You know, and then, like, think abou...
think about the things we said

53:00.543 --> 53:03.680
and the way that we said them
when we were emotional

53:03.712 --> 53:05.480
- that maybe we really...
- I'm not apologizing.

53:05.514 --> 53:07.417
Nope, nope.

53:07.449 --> 53:10.052
And... nor should you,
nor should you at all.

53:10.085 --> 53:13.857
I just thought maybe it's better
to, you know, not hold a grudge.

53:17.058 --> 53:18.794
All right, well...

53:18.828 --> 53:19.795
I'm going to go.

53:23.600 --> 53:26.469
<i>With only a few hours left in
the day and abandoned by our guide,</i>

53:27.737 --> 53:31.407
<i>it was only me and my cameraman
left to fend for ourselves</i>

53:31.440 --> 53:32.942
<i>or be prepared for nightfall.</i>

53:45.087 --> 53:46.723
Hey, guys, it's me,

53:46.755 --> 53:50.092
your old reliable friend,
the Cryptic Commander.

53:50.125 --> 53:52.627
I'm in way
over my fucking head right now.

53:52.661 --> 53:55.365
We're... really lost.

53:55.397 --> 53:57.466
This tree looks like that tree,

53:57.500 --> 53:59.702
and that tree
looks like this tree.

53:59.735 --> 54:03.073
We could be anywhere,
we are so turned around.

54:04.507 --> 54:06.609
I've... I've got to come clean
about something.

54:08.143 --> 54:11.113
A couple of years ago,
I got what's considered...

54:11.147 --> 54:13.982
the best Bigfoot footage
in the world.

54:14.984 --> 54:18.054
So I got a couple books
published because of it, but...

54:18.087 --> 54:21.657
it also absolutely
ruined my life.

54:21.690 --> 54:23.426
But then,

54:23.458 --> 54:26.828
I started this YouTube channel
and I thought, "Oh, my...

54:26.862 --> 54:31.701
my viewers can be my friends, my...
my subscribers, they can be my family."

54:31.734 --> 54:33.902
But it was never enough.

54:34.837 --> 54:39.542
So, when the Compound crew called and said
they wanted to put me in a documentary,

54:39.574 --> 54:41.810
I... I jumped at the chance,

54:41.844 --> 54:44.813
because I was so excited
to talk to someone

54:44.846 --> 54:48.884
about something I cared about
in real life again.

54:48.918 --> 54:55.058
And I wanted them to be so intrigued and
so obsessed with Bigfoot like I am that...

54:59.661 --> 55:00.562
I faked it.

55:02.230 --> 55:05.067
I faked their Bigfoot encounter
on the first night.

55:11.239 --> 55:13.875
I'll be able to get us
out of here, I know I will.

55:13.909 --> 55:15.811
I've been on this mountain
multiple times.

55:17.011 --> 55:19.481
Even when I do,
they're just going to leave.

55:22.518 --> 55:24.686
Because that's
what they always do.

55:26.922 --> 55:28.625
Hold on second,
did y'all hear that?

55:36.998 --> 55:37.900
There it is again.

55:41.103 --> 55:42.539
This could be a real sighting.

55:46.174 --> 55:47.943
Oh my gosh!

55:47.976 --> 55:49.545
There might be more
than one of them.

55:53.781 --> 55:54.817
They're right on top of me.

56:18.607 --> 56:21.210
So, we're here
where our guide told us to stay.

56:21.243 --> 56:24.547
We've been without water
for basically an entire day now

56:24.580 --> 56:26.114
and we're beginning
to lose hope.

56:26.147 --> 56:28.049
How we don't realize this?

56:28.083 --> 56:33.022
Actually, more than one
boy scout on this trip.

56:33.956 --> 56:35.958
I actually managed
to work my way up to tenderfoot.

56:39.228 --> 56:42.264
F###! So the mosquito
net that our guy gave us

56:42.297 --> 56:46.002
is apparently faulty, because I'm
still getting bit right through this.

56:46.034 --> 56:49.004
Probably the worst part of this,
though, is realizing that...

56:49.038 --> 56:51.139
we were better off
following a guy...

56:52.775 --> 56:54.177
...who thought
that Bigfoot was real.

56:57.011 --> 56:57.913
Hello?

56:59.315 --> 57:00.750
Jeff?

57:00.782 --> 57:01.784
Hello?

57:04.252 --> 57:06.221
- Hello?
- Hey!

57:06.255 --> 57:07.723
Hey, anybody down there?

57:07.755 --> 57:09.591
Hey! Have you seen Jeff?

57:09.625 --> 57:12.161
Hey! Oh, boys! Hey there.

57:12.194 --> 57:16.299
No, no Jeff. But how the hell
did you get up here?

57:16.331 --> 57:17.266
You all right?

57:18.167 --> 57:19.235
What happened?

57:20.502 --> 57:21.637
- Okay. Well, well...
- We saw something in the woods.

57:21.670 --> 57:22.838
- ...we were doing a story, like, you know...
- Yeah.

57:22.871 --> 57:25.775
- ...and then... yeah, the thing...
- ...saw something...

57:25.808 --> 57:27.842
- Maybe...
- Look, we don't know where our guide is.

57:27.875 --> 57:30.211
- It was very hectic...
- Okay, okay. Lo... hey!

57:30.244 --> 57:32.147
Hey, calm down, okay?
It's going to be okay.

57:33.081 --> 57:34.217
What got you so spooked?

57:35.284 --> 57:37.052
We saw a dead body.

57:37.085 --> 57:38.253
We were trying to radio you.

57:40.822 --> 57:43.759
Well, sounds like you boys have
been through a lot tonight.

57:45.060 --> 57:47.228
Well, look, I'd love to give you
a ride back in town,

57:47.261 --> 57:50.799
but, uh, unfortunately
you are trespassing.

57:50.833 --> 57:53.035
- What?
- Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

57:53.067 --> 57:55.003
Look, uh, just a formality,

57:55.036 --> 57:56.839
but I am going to need you
to put these on.

57:57.906 --> 58:00.308
- What?
- Mm-hmm. Just protocol, just put them on.

58:00.342 --> 58:02.078
I'll bring you back to town.

58:02.110 --> 58:03.779
But...
but we're lost out in the woods.

58:03.811 --> 58:07.183
I know, and you won't be
real soon, okay?

58:07.215 --> 58:10.619
- Go ahead.
- Dude, I'm not putting on cuffs.

58:10.652 --> 58:11.353
Please.

58:14.889 --> 58:16.658
All right, we tried
to do things the easy way.

58:18.726 --> 58:20.062
I think you better put these on.

58:20.996 --> 58:22.965
He doesn't take kindly
to strangers.

58:23.898 --> 58:25.333
It's about time
we turn this off.

58:28.036 --> 58:30.172
<i>We were caught in
something bigger than we expected.</i>

58:30.205 --> 58:32.273
<i>And the monster we were chasing</i>

58:32.306 --> 58:34.176
<i>was about to show its face.</i>

58:35.677 --> 58:37.346
<i>This thing recording?</i>

58:37.378 --> 58:39.214
Oh, hell yeah, what's up, world?

58:39.248 --> 58:41.150
It's your boy, Trucknutz!

58:41.183 --> 58:44.052
We out here in the dirty south
moving product.

58:44.085 --> 58:47.055
You know how we do.
You heard of the Cali cartel?

58:47.089 --> 58:50.025
Well, we're the Mountain Dew
Mafia, that's right.

58:50.058 --> 58:53.928
Let me show you all around,
this is my boy, Stevie.

58:53.962 --> 58:56.398
Man, what the fuck?
We said no names.

58:56.431 --> 58:59.435
- I know that's why I used a fake name, Logan.
- What the fuck, Kyle?

58:59.467 --> 59:01.971
This is my beautiful wife.

59:02.003 --> 59:04.739
What the fuck? I'm trying
to flirt with you, bitch.

59:04.772 --> 59:06.341
So this my man cave, y'all.

59:06.375 --> 59:09.445
I got a big screen TV,
the flat kind,

59:09.478 --> 59:11.414
I got an Xbox 360,

59:11.447 --> 59:14.784
check me out, my gamertag
is countryroads1971,

59:14.817 --> 59:18.753
that's the year John Denver
released the real national anthem.

59:18.786 --> 59:21.924
And, uh, what else
I want to show y'all?

59:23.859 --> 59:25.927
Oh, damn,
let me show you the warehouse.

59:25.960 --> 59:28.063
All right, y'all,
welcome to the compound,

59:28.096 --> 59:29.831
where the real action happens.

59:29.864 --> 59:31.332
Yo, check that out.

59:31.366 --> 59:33.768
Just when y'all thought
we were done, right?

59:33.802 --> 59:37.940
We're contributing to the
motherfucking opioid epidemic.

59:37.973 --> 59:41.043
That's right. This is a brick
of fentanyl right here,

59:41.076 --> 59:42.878
it's all wrapped up
in Saran Wrap,

59:42.911 --> 59:44.714
I guess they're going
to chop it up and...

59:44.746 --> 59:46.449
and put it in these,
uh, stuffed animals.

59:46.482 --> 59:48.250
Y'all seen <i>Traffic,</i> right?

59:48.282 --> 59:49.819
It's just like that.

59:49.851 --> 59:51.386
Hey, What are you doing?

59:51.420 --> 59:52.955
You can't be in here, man!

59:55.223 --> 59:56.725
These are my boys, right here.

59:58.893 --> 01:00:01.496
Hey! Get the fuck
out of here now!

01:00:01.529 --> 01:00:03.364
- All right, Jesus!
- You ain't supposed to be in here.

01:00:03.397 --> 01:00:05.834
- Get out of here!
- Goddamn!

01:00:05.868 --> 01:00:07.268
Let's go look at some guns.

01:00:07.302 --> 01:00:09.472
Bam! This is my gun collection
right here.

01:00:09.505 --> 01:00:11.440
I love these guns
like my family.

01:00:11.473 --> 01:00:14.442
I know them like the back
of my fucking hand, dude.

01:00:14.476 --> 01:00:17.346
This is my long gun.
This is my short gun.

01:00:17.378 --> 01:00:20.415
These are all my baby girls right
there, all three of them.

01:00:20.449 --> 01:00:22.885
Uh, this, of course,
is more fentanyl bricks.

01:00:22.918 --> 01:00:25.821
We sell so much fucking
fentanyl bricks,

01:00:25.853 --> 01:00:27.790
like, suck it, El Chapo.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:35.130
Let's check out my truck, y'all. I mean, fuck this.

01:00:35.163 --> 01:00:37.866
So, this is it right here,
y'all, this is my baby.

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:40.369
I'mma drop a LS3 in this sucker.

01:00:40.402 --> 01:00:43.938
I'mma be cruising on 22s, like,

01:00:43.971 --> 01:00:45.941
she might not look
like much right now...

01:00:47.141 --> 01:00:48.277
but check this out.

01:00:53.882 --> 01:00:56.552
Dude! I already told you once.

01:00:56.585 --> 01:00:58.387
Get out of the damn warehouse!

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.456
- We're working.
- All right, fine.

01:01:00.489 --> 01:01:02.023
I'm going to the stable

01:01:02.056 --> 01:01:03.859
where at least I get respect.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.861
Haters, y'all!

01:01:06.895 --> 01:01:08.797
Now we're in the stable,

01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:10.399
where we got hella horses.

01:01:10.431 --> 01:01:13.835
Just your regular, you know,
run-of-the-mill stable.

01:01:13.868 --> 01:01:16.971
Psych! We got prisoners
up in here too!

01:01:17.005 --> 01:01:19.008
Look at those bitches in there.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.576
They're... they're our
real human captives.

01:01:21.610 --> 01:01:24.247
Shut the fuck up. Shut up.

01:01:25.147 --> 01:01:29.051
- Yeah, we just kind of do with them what we please.
- Carl, what are you doing?

01:01:29.083 --> 01:01:31.085
You know,
I'm trying to go viral, cuz.

01:01:31.118 --> 01:01:32.521
We got work to do
and you're fucking around.

01:01:36.592 --> 01:01:39.895
<i>We had our camera back,
but without an escape plan,</i>

01:01:39.927 --> 01:01:41.362
<i>it wasn't much good.</i>

01:01:41.395 --> 01:01:43.298
So, they just kidnapped
all three of us?

01:01:43.331 --> 01:01:45.100
And me.

01:01:45.132 --> 01:01:47.837
Oh, right. I forgot
to properly introduce you guys.

01:01:47.869 --> 01:01:49.871
Jeff, this is Darren.
He's a Bigfoot hunter

01:01:49.904 --> 01:01:51.906
who likes to gargle animal piss.

01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:53.475
Darren, this is Jeff.

01:01:53.507 --> 01:01:56.377
He's a Bigfoot hunter
who likes to drink his own piss.

01:01:56.411 --> 01:01:58.013
Gross!

01:01:58.045 --> 01:02:00.248
The first thing
you guys will hear, I, uh,

01:02:00.281 --> 01:02:01.984
I faked that Bigfoot attack.

01:02:02.016 --> 01:02:04.118
Bigfoot is real,
when we get out of here,

01:02:04.152 --> 01:02:07.423
I promise I will take you guys
back out in the woods

01:02:07.456 --> 01:02:10.059
and help you find
the real Bigfoot.

01:02:10.092 --> 01:02:12.328
I am... I'm sorry I lied,
but I had to create

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:15.230
a false flag situation
to get you guys hooked.

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:16.532
We're not getting out of here.

01:02:19.333 --> 01:02:21.203
Well, fine, but...

01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:24.540
it felt nice to get that off
my chest, since we're friends.

01:02:24.572 --> 01:02:26.074
We're not friends.

01:02:26.107 --> 01:02:27.109
You're a liar.

01:02:28.143 --> 01:02:30.378
And I get that most
Bigfoot hunters are liars.

01:02:31.413 --> 01:02:33.549
But the most upsetting part
of all of this

01:02:33.581 --> 01:02:36.018
is that I believed you.

01:02:36.051 --> 01:02:38.152
I believed a Bigfoot hunter.

01:02:38.185 --> 01:02:42.457
I'm going to die because I
trusted a fucking Bigfoot hunter.

01:02:42.491 --> 01:02:45.194
Hey, but that's... that's alright,
because I must be the most trash

01:02:45.226 --> 01:02:47.529
fucking journalist
on the whole planet.

01:02:48.563 --> 01:02:50.566
Why do I even think
I could do something like

01:02:50.598 --> 01:02:53.334
investigative journalism
when I can't even see

01:02:53.368 --> 01:02:57.306
that I'm walking head first
into a drug cartel?

01:02:58.339 --> 01:03:01.476
But it's no big deal,
because you know what?

01:03:01.509 --> 01:03:04.112
I'll die doing what I'm best at

01:03:04.145 --> 01:03:06.214
which is interviewing
a fucking shit...

01:03:06.248 --> 01:03:08.450
I said shut up.

01:03:08.482 --> 01:03:10.551
We're literally trapped
in a cage right now.

01:03:10.585 --> 01:03:13.554
And the only person
you're worried about is you!

01:03:13.587 --> 01:03:15.189
Yeah, you already left me
once in this trip.

01:03:15.223 --> 01:03:17.960
How much longer till
you leave me for PBS?

01:03:19.594 --> 01:03:21.630
Oh, yeah, you didn't think
I knew about that, did you?

01:03:23.031 --> 01:03:24.699
You're literally
nothing without me too.

01:03:24.732 --> 01:03:27.302
By the way, we've been
working together for five years

01:03:27.335 --> 01:03:29.504
and you still haven't
learned how to hold the camera.

01:03:29.538 --> 01:03:30.438
Give me that.

01:03:35.743 --> 01:03:37.612
<i>Oh, s###.</i>

01:03:37.645 --> 01:03:39.614
<i>A familiar face.</i>

01:03:39.647 --> 01:03:41.216
<i>And not in a good way.</i>

01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:44.653
<i>Anyone familiar
with</i> FBI's Most Wanted

01:03:44.685 --> 01:03:47.522
<i>would recognize
the face of Ma Pritchard.</i>

01:03:47.556 --> 01:03:50.626
<i>Born in Macon, Georgia,
under the name Rose McCoy,</i>

01:03:50.659 --> 01:03:52.628
<i>her first brush
with the law came early</i>

01:03:52.661 --> 01:03:56.565
<i>while acting as her father's
look out during armed robberies.</i>

01:03:56.598 --> 01:03:59.168
<i>Often referred
to as Dixie's last kingpin,</i>

01:03:59.201 --> 01:04:02.271
<i>she started a criminal empire
out of a group of runaways</i>

01:04:02.304 --> 01:04:05.107
<i>and foster children
that she raised herself.</i>

01:04:06.007 --> 01:04:09.043
<i>Now, some of the Deep South's
most vicious criminals</i>

01:04:09.076 --> 01:04:11.947
<i>affectionately
refer to her as "Ma."</i>

01:04:14.116 --> 01:04:17.085
<i>Notoriously violent, they're

01:04:17.118 --> 01:04:19.120
<i>of anyone

01:04:19.154 --> 01:04:20.989
<i>Wanted for laundering,

01:04:21.022 --> 01:04:23.157
<i>violent crimes
and felony murder.</i>

01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:25.593
<i>It's long been suspected
that her criminal enterprise</i>

01:04:25.627 --> 01:04:28.496
<i>has expanded
into drug smuggling.</i>

01:04:28.529 --> 01:04:32.000
<i>Considered by authorities to be one
of the most violent criminals at large</i>

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:33.502
<i>in the United States,</i>

01:04:33.534 --> 01:04:36.205
<i>Ma Pritchard
hasn't been seen in years,</i>

01:04:36.237 --> 01:04:39.140
<i>and her whereabouts
are still unknown</i>

01:04:39.174 --> 01:04:40.309
<i>until right now.</i>

01:04:40.342 --> 01:04:42.011
You keep rolling there, boy.

01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:44.679
Trust me when I tell you,

01:04:44.712 --> 01:04:47.448
I'll be the only one
that ever sees that.

01:04:47.482 --> 01:04:50.052
We work for a news network.
I'm making a documentary.

01:04:50.085 --> 01:04:51.453
It's a documentary
about Bigfoot.

01:04:54.188 --> 01:04:57.393
Y'all think there are
Sasquatches up here, in Georgia?

01:04:57.426 --> 01:04:59.061
Ma, it ain't that...

01:04:59.094 --> 01:05:01.063
it ain't that ridiculous.
Like, Bigfoot's real.

01:05:01.096 --> 01:05:03.331
You're not bringing
that up again, are you?

01:05:03.364 --> 01:05:06.468
I'm just... I'm just saying,
you know, like, Sasquatch is real.

01:05:08.203 --> 01:05:09.538
Alright? He's a Georgia boy.

01:05:09.571 --> 01:05:11.406
You guys sound
like a Goddamn redneck,

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:14.243
and you gonna make the rest
of us look like hillbillies.

01:05:14.275 --> 01:05:17.013
- Ma, I told you, I've seen him though. Remember?
- You've seen him?

01:05:20.114 --> 01:05:22.484
I mean, I heard him at least,
but I done told you that, remember the...

01:05:24.453 --> 01:05:26.588
That was us.

01:05:26.621 --> 01:05:29.725
We're smuggling heroin
through the woods.

01:05:29.757 --> 01:05:32.627
Oh, hey, this my lucky opener.

01:05:34.462 --> 01:05:37.198
So, all this time,
all those Bigfoot occurrences,

01:05:37.232 --> 01:05:38.833
it's just been you guys.

01:05:40.668 --> 01:05:43.304
Well, you said you came up here
looking for Bigfoot,

01:05:43.337 --> 01:05:45.773
and I guess you found him.

01:05:45.806 --> 01:05:50.413
And now, we're going to find out
who you're really working for.

01:05:51.679 --> 01:05:53.514
Get that one right there.

01:05:53.547 --> 01:05:55.750
He looks ready to talk.

01:05:55.784 --> 01:05:57.686
No! No, no, no! No! No!

01:06:05.493 --> 01:06:07.495
Jeff,
what the fuck are we going to do?

01:06:07.529 --> 01:06:09.231
Do you know what this means?

01:06:09.264 --> 01:06:10.499
Yeah, if we don't
get out of here,

01:06:10.531 --> 01:06:12.167
they're going to murder Zach.

01:06:12.199 --> 01:06:14.203
It means Bigfoot isn't real.

01:06:14.235 --> 01:06:15.737
Oh. What?

01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:19.574
It means all those years
out in the field doing research,

01:06:19.607 --> 01:06:23.344
I've just been chasing after
a group a hillbilly criminals.

01:06:23.377 --> 01:06:25.179
Jeff, snap out of it.

01:06:25.212 --> 01:06:27.748
This must be what I deserve
for pushing everyone away.

01:06:27.781 --> 01:06:30.651
<i>I felt for him, but right
now I couldn't have him like this.</i>

01:06:30.685 --> 01:06:33.154
Uh, look, look, look.
They left the keys!

01:06:33.188 --> 01:06:35.357
Okay, okay.
We can't reach through the bars.

01:06:35.389 --> 01:06:38.594
- But...
- But you remember when you showed me your lasso trick?

01:06:38.627 --> 01:06:39.895
- Oh.
- Great!

01:06:39.927 --> 01:06:43.898
So we can use my belt

01:06:43.931 --> 01:06:46.634
and form it into a lasso

01:06:46.668 --> 01:06:48.470
and get the keys off the hook.

01:06:48.502 --> 01:06:51.339
And then I'll use my arms,
my skinny arms

01:06:51.373 --> 01:06:53.275
to reach through the cage
and I can reach down there

01:06:53.308 --> 01:06:55.210
and I can grab the keys,
get out of these cuffs,

01:06:55.243 --> 01:06:56.578
and then we can go
and save Zach.

01:06:57.779 --> 01:07:00.683
Do you really want
to live in a world...

01:07:02.317 --> 01:07:05.186
knowing that Bigfoot isn't real?

01:07:05.219 --> 01:07:07.488
Well, I never thought...

01:07:07.522 --> 01:07:10.259
- Yes. Yes, I would.
- Fine.

01:07:21.502 --> 01:07:22.904
You had that the entire time?

01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:25.273
Yeah. Brian,

01:07:25.306 --> 01:07:27.341
how many times
do I have to tell you guys?

01:07:27.375 --> 01:07:30.679
I am an Eagle Scout.

01:07:30.712 --> 01:07:32.614
I always come prepared.

01:07:32.647 --> 01:07:33.748
That was incredible.

01:07:33.781 --> 01:07:35.650
Who cares?

01:07:35.683 --> 01:07:38.452
- You still think I'm an idiot.
- No.

01:07:38.485 --> 01:07:40.522
No, I'm sorry about what I said.

01:07:40.554 --> 01:07:42.823
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

01:07:42.857 --> 01:07:46.228
Jeff, you're a badass.
I couldn't have gotten out of these cuffs.

01:07:46.261 --> 01:07:49.297
<i>It was true, without Jeff,
we'd have been fertilizer.</i>

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:50.900
Yeah, you're right,
you couldn't have.

01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:55.670
Holy shit, did I just
break us out of handcuffs?

01:07:56.705 --> 01:07:58.873
I'm a fucking badass.

01:07:58.906 --> 01:08:01.709
I'm a badass
with or without Bigfoot.

01:08:01.743 --> 01:08:03.844
Ye... Yeah!

01:08:03.877 --> 01:08:06.681
You know what?
There's a man who needs saving.

01:08:09.717 --> 01:08:11.286
And I'm going to be
the one to do it.

01:08:12.286 --> 01:08:15.256
- Is it me?
- Oh. Um...

01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:18.759
- Shit. Uh...
- Uh, we... we should...

01:08:18.792 --> 01:08:21.295
- Um, yes. Yes.
- I mean, I guess.

01:08:21.328 --> 01:08:22.831
<i>Now that Jeff
was back in action,</i>

01:08:22.863 --> 01:08:24.732
<i>it was up to him, myself,</i>

01:08:24.765 --> 01:08:26.634
<i>and the pee-pee guy from earlier</i>

01:08:26.667 --> 01:08:29.638
<i>to hatch a plan
and save my best friend.</i>

01:08:29.670 --> 01:08:33.207
<i>But standing directly in front
of Zach was an armed guard.</i>

01:08:34.042 --> 01:08:36.745
Okay, so I think our best bet
is to distract him.

01:08:36.777 --> 01:08:39.013
- You come up from behind.
- Okay, and then what?

01:08:39.046 --> 01:08:41.750
Then, Jeff, you'll grab him, and,
Darren, you'll come up and disarm him.

01:08:41.782 --> 01:08:43.919
Wait. He has a gun?

01:08:43.951 --> 01:08:46.654
Yeah, but with the three of us,
we can totally take them.

01:08:46.687 --> 01:08:49.756
Okay, yeah, right.
So, we just ambush him, huh?

01:08:49.790 --> 01:08:52.261
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, exactly.
So I'll come up from behind,

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:55.497
and once I'm in position,
you just come charging in from the front.

01:08:55.529 --> 01:08:58.767
The front?
So, like, where the gun is?

01:08:58.799 --> 01:09:02.435
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, man, we just rescued you.

01:09:02.469 --> 01:09:04.939
Yeah, and I appreciate that
and all, but...

01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:10.011
- I'm kind of a coward.
- Darren, you got this.

01:09:10.044 --> 01:09:12.513
This is our chance
for us to show the world

01:09:12.546 --> 01:09:16.551
that Bigfoot hunters aren't just
a bunch of crybaby, sissy loonies.

01:09:16.584 --> 01:09:17.620
Hell yeah!

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:21.490
- Okay. Yeah, let's do this.
- Alright.

01:09:21.522 --> 01:09:23.292
Okay, great. Awesome.
So here's the plan.

01:09:23.325 --> 01:09:25.060
Jeff, you sneak
around the back, you get him,

01:09:25.093 --> 01:09:27.595
you grab him, that's when Darren
and I... Darren, we come in, we...

01:09:31.665 --> 01:09:33.935
- Oh, shit.
- Okay. I guess we're doing it ourselves.

01:09:33.968 --> 01:09:35.636
Are you sure?

01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:38.773
Jeff... you got this.

01:09:38.807 --> 01:09:39.808
Thanks, Brian.

01:09:52.053 --> 01:09:55.891
<i>I wasn't sure what Jeff's plan
was, but it was now or never.</i>

01:09:55.923 --> 01:09:56.792
Hey!

01:09:57.792 --> 01:09:59.093
What are you doing out here?

01:09:59.127 --> 01:10:01.562
Uh, I, um... I'm...
it's me from earlier.

01:10:01.596 --> 01:10:03.065
And I also do a show

01:10:03.097 --> 01:10:06.400
and I was just wondering

01:10:06.433 --> 01:10:08.904
what it's like being
a member of the cartel.

01:10:08.937 --> 01:10:10.673
Dude, you know...

01:10:11.572 --> 01:10:13.040
- Oh my god.
- What the fuck?

01:10:13.074 --> 01:10:15.677
Oh my god! It was so easy.

01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:17.712
Brian, I've only
ever seen that in movies.

01:10:17.745 --> 01:10:19.815
I mean, his neck snapped
like it was made of candy.

01:10:19.847 --> 01:10:21.782
Yeah, I meant knock him out.

01:10:21.816 --> 01:10:24.419
Brian, don't you put this on me.
You said to take care of it.

01:10:24.451 --> 01:10:26.088
Shit!

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.422
Grab his knife!

01:10:33.828 --> 01:10:35.763
Brian, you didn't ditch me.

01:10:35.797 --> 01:10:37.532
Guys, let's do this.

01:10:44.905 --> 01:10:47.743
All right, all right. Freeze.

01:10:49.811 --> 01:10:52.081
Please. Please, just let us go.

01:10:52.981 --> 01:10:55.917
- Hey, Ma, they are here!
- Come on, we'll delete all the footage.

01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:58.487
- We won't tell anyone, please, just let us go.
- No, no. I ain't fucking dumb.

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.688
Alright, come on, back
to the barn. Come on. Come on.

01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:05.726
Oh my god.
You all hear that?

01:11:05.759 --> 01:11:07.495
That's the mighty Bigfoot.

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:11.800
You heard that, right?

01:11:11.833 --> 01:11:13.869
You heard that? That was me.

01:11:13.901 --> 01:11:16.036
I just did the Bigfoot call.
That was really me!

01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:18.807
Yeah, you know, it was...
it was close, definitely an A for effort.

01:11:18.839 --> 01:11:21.842
But you know what?
Congratulations, it worked.

01:11:21.875 --> 01:11:24.012
<i>And at that moment, it hit me.</i>

01:11:24.044 --> 01:11:26.447
<i>Maybe we weren't hunting
Bigfoot the creature,</i>

01:11:26.481 --> 01:11:28.517
<i>but the Bigfoot in ourselves.</i>

01:11:29.918 --> 01:11:31.754
What are you guys doing?
Come on!

01:11:34.755 --> 01:11:37.825
<i>It was dark and we lost
our guide almost instantly,</i>

01:11:37.859 --> 01:11:39.828
<i>but he hadn't lost us.</i>

01:11:39.861 --> 01:11:42.865
- What the fuck?
- Come here. Shh, shh!

01:12:06.254 --> 01:12:07.989
<i>I was losing my shit.</i>

01:12:08.021 --> 01:12:10.124
<i>But Jeff kept
a cool head the entire time.</i>

01:12:10.157 --> 01:12:12.160
<i>Maybe his boy scout skills
would be enough</i>

01:12:12.192 --> 01:12:13.227
<i>to get us
out of this mess alive.</i>

01:12:13.261 --> 01:12:15.696
Well, well, well.

01:12:15.730 --> 01:12:20.000
Oh! Nice and easy now.
Hands up. Come on over.

01:12:20.034 --> 01:12:22.070
Come on. Oh. Watch your step.

01:12:22.102 --> 01:12:23.804
Yeah. There you go.

01:12:23.838 --> 01:12:24.973
Alright. Now...

01:12:25.973 --> 01:12:29.076
We were just
going to kill you...

01:12:30.143 --> 01:12:36.083
but now we got to go straight up
<i>Deliverance</i> on your asses.

01:12:38.719 --> 01:12:40.054
We're going to what?

01:12:40.088 --> 01:12:44.625
We are going
to mess them up real good.

01:12:44.659 --> 01:12:46.962
- Yeah.
- Right, but they do some, uh,

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:49.631
they do some, uh, kind of
fucked up shit in that movie.

01:12:49.664 --> 01:12:51.933
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
- <i>Deliverance?</i>

01:12:51.965 --> 01:12:55.570
Oh, yeah. That right there.

01:12:55.602 --> 01:12:57.172
Mm.

01:12:58.539 --> 01:13:01.509
Hey, uh, is there anything
you want to tell me, like...

01:13:01.543 --> 01:13:03.512
Hey, boss. Come on over here.

01:13:03.544 --> 01:13:05.746
So, y'all think
your time here is up, huh?

01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:08.215
Grab him, hold him down.

01:13:08.249 --> 01:13:10.218
Hey, we're not doing
anything like,

01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:12.820
specifically
from <i>Deliverance,</i> are we?

01:13:12.853 --> 01:13:15.723
- Grab that one right there.
- Okay, Ma.

01:13:15.757 --> 01:13:18.560
- Come on.
- I'm not going to give him a chance to escape again.

01:13:18.593 --> 01:13:19.961
Down!

01:13:19.994 --> 01:13:21.096
Hold still.

01:13:22.096 --> 01:13:25.000
So, you claim to be a reporter?

01:13:25.032 --> 01:13:29.271
Well, I don't know too much about
journalism, but I do know this,

01:13:29.303 --> 01:13:33.941
you're not supposed to interfere
with what you've been reporting of,

01:13:33.975 --> 01:13:36.111
you're supposed to observe.

01:13:36.143 --> 01:13:39.981
Now, you had the opportunity
to turn around and go home,

01:13:40.013 --> 01:13:43.618
but you didn't do it, because
you're bad at what you're doing.

01:13:43.651 --> 01:13:46.121
You're so bad at this,
you're so bad at this

01:13:46.154 --> 01:13:47.789
that you're going to die.

01:13:47.821 --> 01:13:50.859
And ain't nobody
going to hear your story.

01:13:50.892 --> 01:13:53.562
Oh, shit! Hey, guys!

01:13:54.294 --> 01:13:56.163
Zach. Awesome. You made it out.

01:13:56.196 --> 01:13:59.101
Well, I'm just going to be leaving...

01:14:00.834 --> 01:14:03.672
- Who is that guy?
- He's one of their friends.

01:14:03.704 --> 01:14:05.639
Okay. Alright.

01:14:05.673 --> 01:14:08.843
And now I'm going
to gut you like a fish

01:14:08.875 --> 01:14:11.146
for what you did to my boy.

01:14:12.646 --> 01:14:13.548
I'm sorry...

01:14:14.848 --> 01:14:15.816
for everything.

01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:19.219
<i>So this was it.</i>

01:14:19.253 --> 01:14:21.289
<i>We were going to die.</i>

01:14:21.321 --> 01:14:22.290
<i>And how?</i>

01:14:23.357 --> 01:14:24.359
<i>Chasing Bigfoot.</i>

01:14:26.326 --> 01:14:28.128
<i>When you put it that way,</i>

01:14:28.161 --> 01:14:30.231
<i>it sounds pretty stupid.</i>

01:14:30.263 --> 01:14:32.299
<i>Being so desperate for a story</i>

01:14:32.333 --> 01:14:35.637
<i>that you'd literally follow
a stranger into the woods</i>

01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:39.007
<i>on a complete and total lie.</i>

01:14:39.039 --> 01:14:41.308
<i>I have felt so hopelessly
stuck in my career</i>

01:14:41.342 --> 01:14:44.112
<i>that I got myself, my cameraman</i>

01:14:44.145 --> 01:14:46.348
<i>and an Eagle Scout killed.</i>

01:14:47.882 --> 01:14:51.719
<i>And absolutely nothing
could save us now.</i>

01:14:57.191 --> 01:14:59.761
- What the hell is that?
- They're just trying to trick us again.

01:15:04.699 --> 01:15:06.401
What's that?

01:15:11.338 --> 01:15:13.707
Oh, hell, no!

01:15:16.444 --> 01:15:18.279
<i>Something had saved us,</i>

01:15:18.312 --> 01:15:20.248
<i>but we weren't
out of the woods just yet.</i>

01:15:32.759 --> 01:15:34.663
<i>It attacked our kidnappers,</i>

01:15:34.695 --> 01:15:37.131
<i>providing us
enough cover to slip away,</i>

01:15:37.164 --> 01:15:41.969
<i>and finally capture the first
clear footage of Bigfoot.</i>

01:15:42.003 --> 01:15:44.406
Stay completely still,
his vision detects no movement.

01:15:48.241 --> 01:15:49.177
His vision's normal.

01:15:49.209 --> 01:15:51.779
His vision's normal!

01:15:51.812 --> 01:15:53.447
<i>Well, his vision was normal,</i>

01:15:53.481 --> 01:15:54.883
<i>his sights
were set on someone else...</i>

01:15:54.915 --> 01:15:56.418
Oh my fucking God!

01:15:57.919 --> 01:15:58.920
<i>...Ma.</i>

01:16:02.956 --> 01:16:04.125
Oh my God.

01:16:05.192 --> 01:16:06.794
What the fuck?

01:16:06.828 --> 01:16:08.864
- Shit, shit, shit, shit!
- Oh my god.

01:16:11.732 --> 01:16:12.833
Come on, come on!

01:16:16.504 --> 01:16:18.440
<i>We ran for as long
and as hard as we could.</i>

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:22.710
<i>Probably over a mile, and we
needed to catch our breath.</i>

01:16:25.079 --> 01:16:27.182
Holy shit! Holy shit,
was that really Bigfoot?

01:16:27.214 --> 01:16:30.451
I knew it. I knew it.
I knew he was real.

01:16:30.485 --> 01:16:31.687
No, you didn't.

01:16:32.419 --> 01:16:33.922
Why didn't he come after us?

01:16:33.954 --> 01:16:38.425
Zach, I told you,
Bigfoot hates guns!

01:16:38.459 --> 01:16:42.764
Bigfoot... hates... guns!

01:16:45.298 --> 01:16:48.869
Oh! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

01:16:50.937 --> 01:16:52.906
<i>After running
for what felt like hours,</i>

01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:55.811
<i>we discovered an old service
road that led back to town.</i>

01:17:00.914 --> 01:17:01.816
Oh my god.

01:17:02.918 --> 01:17:05.253
Oh my god. I know this road.
We're so close to town.

01:17:05.285 --> 01:17:07.087
<i>And now we
were out of the woods,</i>

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.824
<i>our problems were far from over.</i>

01:17:11.325 --> 01:17:12.394
Freeze!

01:17:13.326 --> 01:17:15.195
Hands up, motherfuckers.

01:17:15.228 --> 01:17:17.865
Heard a little bit of commotion.
What happened to my cousins?

01:17:18.999 --> 01:17:20.968
Wait, you guys are related?

01:17:21.002 --> 01:17:22.771
You don't look anything alike.

01:17:22.803 --> 01:17:24.404
Let's just say
that we were close enough

01:17:24.437 --> 01:17:27.107
that I'll kill you for whatever
the fuck you did to them.

01:17:27.141 --> 01:17:28.543
So that's a no?

01:17:28.575 --> 01:17:30.544
Fuck you!

01:17:30.578 --> 01:17:32.347
Officer in Highway 41
requesting back-up.

01:17:32.379 --> 01:17:35.115
I have three suspects
possibly armed.

01:17:35.148 --> 01:17:38.986
- We don't have a gun.
- Put your hands behind your fucking heads.

01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:42.790
Ten-Four, please hurry, suspects
are approaching my vehicle.

01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:44.359
Don't you fucking move!

01:17:46.994 --> 01:17:47.963
Hmm?

01:17:50.998 --> 01:17:54.235
This is Officer 544,
suspects confirmed armed.

01:17:54.267 --> 01:17:55.302
Pick it up.

01:17:56.337 --> 01:17:58.239
- Touch it, shithead.
- I... No.

01:17:58.271 --> 01:18:00.040
- I said pick it up!
- No!

01:18:02.476 --> 01:18:04.212
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

01:18:04.245 --> 01:18:06.848
Shots fired. Shots fired!

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:09.249
Boom!

01:18:09.282 --> 01:18:10.317
Fuck.

01:18:11.319 --> 01:18:12.486
Hey.

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:16.124
It's Sid, I'm back!

01:18:16.156 --> 01:18:17.191
You remember me?

01:18:18.392 --> 01:18:20.461
- What the hell?
- Oh my god.

01:18:20.494 --> 01:18:22.964
Sid, you saved us.
Hell yeah, man!

01:18:22.996 --> 01:18:24.365
What the hell
are you doing out here?

01:18:25.465 --> 01:18:26.535
Oh, Jeff.

01:18:29.070 --> 01:18:31.438
- I'm going to get you.
- Back up. He's going to do it.

01:18:31.472 --> 01:18:32.974
He will do it. Back up.

01:18:33.007 --> 01:18:34.810
Back up. Sid,
it's going to be alright.

01:18:36.009 --> 01:18:39.880
Okay, I think if we just keep walking
like this, it's going to be okay.

01:18:39.914 --> 01:18:41.182
<i>And that was it.</i>

01:18:41.214 --> 01:18:43.150
<i>The end of an arduous journey</i>

01:18:43.183 --> 01:18:46.087
<i>that proved the existence
of a mythological creature,</i>

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:48.289
<i>and would lead ultimately
to the uncovering</i>

01:18:48.321 --> 01:18:51.959
<i>of one of the largest organized

01:18:51.993 --> 01:18:55.295

<i>Although several

01:19:01.035 --> 01:19:03.404
<i>of the criminal organization

<i>An alarming video

01:19:08.075 --> 01:19:10.612
Look, the video is great,
and I'm really happy with it.

01:19:10.645 --> 01:19:13.313
But I've... I've put
a lot of that behind me.

01:19:13.347 --> 01:19:16.284
The only thing I'm really concerned
with now is planning my wedding.

01:19:19.687 --> 01:19:21.055
<i>And as for me,</i>

01:19:21.088 --> 01:19:22.956
<i>I was finally living my dream</i>

01:20:27.021 --> 01:20:28.456
I brought you here

01:20:28.489 --> 01:20:33.328
for one reason
and one reason alone.

01:20:33.361 --> 01:20:36.197
- What's that?
- To show you...

01:20:36.230 --> 01:20:40.067
what the craft beer scene in
Venezuela is really all about!

01:20:42.602 --> 01:20:44.471
<i>Salud,</i> Brian.

01:20:44.504 --> 01:20:46.473
<i>Sure, it was clickbait...</i>

01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:49.677
<i>but I was great at it.</i>

01:20:49.709 --> 01:20:51.145
<i>Salud!</i>

01:20:51.178 --> 01:20:52.113
We should sit down
and talk about

01:20:52.146 --> 01:20:53.246
how you guys do this,

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.549
because this is something else.

01:20:54.581 --> 01:20:56.150
Well, first you need
to get the house.

01:20:56.182 --> 01:20:58.018
- Yes.
- And we...

01:20:58.052 --> 01:21:00.521
Next to the cocaine,
we have the house.

01:21:00.553 --> 01:21:02.656
We have all the journalists
that we trapped.

01:21:02.690 --> 01:21:04.993
- Yeah.
- They're slaves. They work on the house.

01:21:05.026 --> 01:21:07.996
- They pick it up...
- Are you telling me they work for free?

01:21:08.029 --> 01:21:09.397
That's what a slave is.

01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:13.500
