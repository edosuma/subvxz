00:27.736 --> 00:28.737
[cell phone buzzes]

00:44.836 --> 00:46.212
[exhales deeply]

00:51.176 --> 00:53.428
[shouts indistinctly]

00:53.511 --> 00:54.679
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

00:55.638 --> 00:58.641
-What? I didn't hear my alarm go off.
-That's 'cause it's only 6:23.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.769
Oh, give me my seven more minutes,

01:00.852 --> 01:02.145
-for the love of the Lord.
-No!

01:02.228 --> 01:03.938
I can't wait to tell you any longer.

01:04.731 --> 01:05.857
Oh, no. Did someone die?

01:05.940 --> 01:07.067
Please, don't let anyone be dead.

01:07.150 --> 01:09.360
No one died, except my former child-self,

01:09.444 --> 01:11.321
who was murdered by sex!

01:12.322 --> 01:13.782
Miles and I had sex last night.

01:13.865 --> 01:14.866
[squeals]

01:14.949 --> 01:17.786
You've been waiting
for so long for this moment.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.412
I don't even know
what you're gonna obsess over now.

01:19.496 --> 01:20.330
Hey, shut up!

01:20.413 --> 01:22.165
Well, tell me everything. How was it?

01:22.248 --> 01:24.876
Okay, the first time was really slow,

01:24.959 --> 01:27.337
and romantic, and sweet, and gentle.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.380
Wait. The first time?

01:29.464 --> 01:30.673
Yes. And then the third time

01:30.757 --> 01:32.842
was really
this just surprised continuation

01:32.926 --> 01:34.177
of the end of the second time,

01:34.260 --> 01:37.055
but the fourth time was the best time.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.682
You had sex four times in one night?

01:39.766 --> 01:40.600
Mm-hm.

01:40.683 --> 01:43.311
I didn't know that was possible.
Why was the fourth time the best?

01:43.394 --> 01:45.688
Because that was the time I had an orgasm

01:45.939 --> 01:47.899
while he was inside of me.

01:48.608 --> 01:49.734
I had a sex-gasm.

01:50.568 --> 01:52.070
-You did?
-Yes!

01:52.862 --> 01:56.282
And it was, like, so different
than when I do it to myself, you know?

01:56.366 --> 01:58.034
But it was also different than when

01:58.118 --> 01:59.786
Miles made it happen with other stuff.

01:59.869 --> 02:01.704
I can't really explain it.
It was, like, deeper.

02:01.788 --> 02:04.791
I saw fireworks or, like, fire dancers.

02:04.874 --> 02:06.960
People eating fire. I don't know.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.671
What did you see the
first time you came with Luke?

02:10.755 --> 02:11.714
Oh. Um...

02:11.798 --> 02:14.008
Like, balls of fire and God.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.969
He asked about Chloe, he's so nice.

02:17.011 --> 02:17.846
Cool.

02:19.430 --> 02:20.974
I'm sorry that I asked about Luke.

02:21.432 --> 02:22.392
Are you doing okay?

02:22.475 --> 02:23.726
Oh, better than him.

02:26.104 --> 02:29.149
Oh, my God, 27 text messages.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.108
Poor guy.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.862
Actually, props for his Bitmoji.
It's, like, really accurate.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.655
I don't know what to say. You know?

02:35.738 --> 02:38.116
Like... I don't want him to hurt,

02:39.367 --> 02:42.036
but I'm not actually feeling sad about it.

02:42.745 --> 02:44.414
And I'm trying to. Like...

02:44.873 --> 02:47.208
Like, last night,
I watched a really serious movie

02:47.292 --> 02:48.501
to try and make myself cry

02:48.585 --> 02:50.420
and I just ended up
feeling really smart and happy

02:50.503 --> 02:51.379
because it had subtitles.

02:51.462 --> 02:54.257
[scoffs] You never could have watched
that with Luke. He reads so slow.

02:54.340 --> 02:56.676
I know he's, like,
"Why would I read a movie?

02:56.759 --> 02:58.052
I don't drink meatloaf."

02:58.136 --> 02:59.387
I think you made the right choice.

02:59.470 --> 03:00.638
You deserve to be with somebody

03:00.722 --> 03:02.807
who makes you feel
the way Miles makes me feel.

03:02.891 --> 03:03.892
And how is that?

03:04.392 --> 03:06.186
Like a grown-ass woman.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.897
[theme music]

03:08.980 --> 03:11.274
[vocalizing]

03:28.541 --> 03:29.876
[Debbie clears throat]

03:30.627 --> 03:32.086
Jugo de Naranja?

03:32.170 --> 03:34.672
I went shopping
down at that Mexican market.

03:35.256 --> 03:37.508
I think we all need to learn
to broaden our taste buds.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.052
-[Blair] Mmm.
-[Debbie clears throat]

03:42.138 --> 03:43.014
Okay, fine.

03:43.514 --> 03:44.724
Girls... [exhales deeply]

03:45.808 --> 03:47.602
...we're going to have to cut
some corners now.

03:47.685 --> 03:48.728
[Blair] Now that what?

03:48.811 --> 03:50.021
Now that I'm unemployed.

03:50.104 --> 03:52.273
Your mother's pretty disappointed
about that, if you hadn't noticed.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.234
Well, I'm not disappointed, honey.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.653
I-- I want whatever makes you happiest.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.906
Which, apparently,
is hunting deer on a weekday.

03:59.989 --> 04:02.742
[Anderson] It could be dinner.
Besides, it's been nice to relax a bit.

04:02.825 --> 04:03.826
Clear my mind.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.037
Think about what I want to do next.
[chuckles]

04:06.704 --> 04:08.164
Please don't leave me, honey.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.541
Promise me you won't.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.129
-Promise me, baby.
-[chuckles]

04:15.213 --> 04:16.923
Promise me, please, promise.

04:17.006 --> 04:19.259
Yeah. I promise. That's enough. [chuckles]

04:22.095 --> 04:24.264
Anyway, Sterling's debate championship
is tomorrow.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.306
Exciting, right?

04:25.390 --> 04:26.391
[Debbie] Very exciting.

04:26.474 --> 04:28.142
I wish you'd let your father and me come.

04:28.226 --> 04:30.353
I'm sorry, Mom.
It's just, this one's a really big one

04:30.436 --> 04:32.313
and I don't want to panic and fold.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.691
And having you there
would only stress me out more.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.693
Your mother's always had
that effect on people.

04:43.491 --> 04:45.076
Wow. Mm.

04:45.159 --> 04:46.160
[Anderson] I wa...

04:46.244 --> 04:47.370
[Anderson sighs]

04:48.079 --> 04:49.706
[receding footsteps]

04:54.460 --> 04:55.920
Uh, wow.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.214
Mom and Dad
are both on their periods, it seems like.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.509
Did you know that guys
can get their periods, too?

05:01.592 --> 05:02.510
Like, hormonally?

05:02.593 --> 05:04.095
Of course I knew that.

05:04.178 --> 05:05.346
I know a lot of things.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.517
And... I know a lot of things
that you don't know.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.604
Sex has made you
a little bit insufferable.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.524
Listen up, forensics warriors.

05:16.899 --> 05:18.151
As you know by now,

05:18.234 --> 05:21.404
Willingham is hosting
the citywide tournament tomorrow,

05:22.196 --> 05:23.239
and we're going to do what?

05:25.241 --> 05:27.368
-Win!
-Oh. [squeals]

05:27.952 --> 05:29.329
Now, "Winning isn't everything."

05:29.704 --> 05:31.873
Said no one in this room, right?

05:36.252 --> 05:39.464
Miss Johnson has graciously
volunteered to assist us.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.382
I assume you have debate experience?

05:41.466 --> 05:42.383
Oh, yes, sir.

05:42.467 --> 05:45.970
Oh, my mail person
was leaving things behind my planter,

05:46.054 --> 05:47.638
so I said, "Excuse me.

05:47.722 --> 05:49.891
Could you please put my stuff in my slot?

05:49.974 --> 05:52.685
Because we have gophers
and we have robbers."

05:52.769 --> 05:54.437
And so we had
this whole little back and forth.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.813
Oh, but now guess what?

05:56.147 --> 05:57.273
She does what I ask.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.233
On-- On most days.

06:00.109 --> 06:04.864
Well, I can assure us all
that I know how to win a point

06:04.947 --> 06:06.074
and let me tell you,

06:06.157 --> 06:08.326
as the school's
first white female captain,

06:08.409 --> 06:10.203
I am honored to lead you.

06:10.286 --> 06:13.289
I miss Linda Chatterjee's grace
and unflappable cheer.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.085
I miss her too,

06:18.002 --> 06:21.381
but she has taken her formidable brain

06:21.464 --> 06:24.008
and remarkably large overbite

06:24.092 --> 06:26.761
-to the leftist coast at Stanford.
-[Ellen] Hm.

06:26.844 --> 06:30.598
So, with the Lord's help,
we will soldier through.

06:31.808 --> 06:35.603
I've prepared dossiers
on every school's forensics captain,

06:35.686 --> 06:39.190
including this year's defending champion,
Craig Wu.

06:39.273 --> 06:40.108
[Ellen] Ooh.

06:40.191 --> 06:43.152
The dossiers include:
strengths, weaknesses,

06:43.236 --> 06:45.071
marital status of the parents

06:45.154 --> 06:49.283
and yes, perceived hotness
at their respective schools.

06:49.700 --> 06:53.079
All of us need to be on point tomorrow.

06:53.955 --> 06:56.791
We don't want any
screw-ups like last year.

06:56.874 --> 06:57.834
[sighs]

06:57.917 --> 07:02.588
Therefore, federal funding
for transportation infrastructure

07:02.672 --> 07:04.674
-should not be guaranteed.
-[ticking]

07:04.757 --> 07:07.635
Isn't improving ports
the most federal of responsibilities?

07:07.718 --> 07:09.220
Federal government investment is needed

07:09.303 --> 07:11.931
to maintain the US as a world leader
in global commerce.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.936
-You make a great point.
-[timer beeps]

07:18.229 --> 07:19.272
[man] Don't worry, Wesley.

07:19.355 --> 07:21.357
Tomorrow's a new day,
so go get some sleep.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.403
And all of you, if you come in here
looking bleary-eyed,

07:25.570 --> 07:28.281
I will pin you down and Visine you myself.

07:34.495 --> 07:35.830
[exhales deeply]

07:35.913 --> 07:40.251
Girls, try to remember
that you're on the same team.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.545
You used to be so close.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.172
I'm sure you can find that again.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.423
Just try.

07:46.007 --> 07:49.343
Coach, I was thinking about
bringing muffins to the other teams.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.762
I was thinking,
would you want to go in halfsies or--

07:51.846 --> 07:53.556
[Ellen continues talking indistinctly]

07:53.639 --> 07:55.808
We used to be on the same page,
like, all the time.

07:56.601 --> 07:57.435
Did we?

07:57.852 --> 07:59.061
Maybe I blocked it out.

07:59.854 --> 08:00.688
Come on.

08:01.397 --> 08:04.150
Remember in fifth grade
when we convinced Mrs. Willis

08:04.233 --> 08:05.234
that we should have a lesson

08:05.318 --> 08:08.112
on the cultural significance
of the "Bad Blood" music video?

08:08.196 --> 08:11.782
Till that rat-faced Marcy Browning
reminded her of our quiz.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.242
She was the worst.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.619
Total narc.

08:18.372 --> 08:20.625
At least I still got 100 on that quiz.

08:20.708 --> 08:24.086
I got 95
because I spelled Quakers with a "C".

08:25.463 --> 08:26.547
"Quackers".

08:26.631 --> 08:28.382
It drove me crazy for, like, a month.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.176
[both laugh]

08:40.561 --> 08:42.063
We need to be
on each other's sides to win,

08:43.022 --> 08:45.399
but after tomorrow, it's back to normal.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.610
I.e., me knowing that you're fake

08:47.693 --> 08:50.988
and being the only person in school
who can see it.

08:53.449 --> 08:54.617
[door opens]

08:55.576 --> 08:56.577
[door closes]

09:00.373 --> 09:02.583
Did you know that the French
call the moment of orgasm

09:02.667 --> 09:03.751
"The Little Death"?

09:04.835 --> 09:06.629
Do you think cumming is like dying?

09:06.712 --> 09:09.173
If it is, then I'm like a cat
with nine lives,

09:09.257 --> 09:11.801
and I just used a big one.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.262
[chuckles]
But I'm gonna need, like, 9,000 lives

09:14.345 --> 09:17.056
if I die a little bit
every time I have a sex orgasm.

09:17.139 --> 09:18.182
Ah, here it is.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.309
Okay. I think we've reached a point
in our relationship

09:20.393 --> 09:21.894
where I would like stronger boundaries.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.105
The next time Miles and I have sex
I'm going to be, like...

09:24.188 --> 09:25.731
[grunting]

09:25.815 --> 09:26.941
And then I'm gonna flip him over

09:27.024 --> 09:29.068
and I'm gonna be like bam! Bam! Bam!

09:29.151 --> 09:31.529
And then he's gonna be, like... [moans]

09:31.612 --> 09:33.990
And then I'm going to do this thing
with my hips that I read about,

09:34.073 --> 09:35.741
and he's gonna be, like, [squeals]

09:35.825 --> 09:37.368
Okay, I don't wanna hear anymore.

09:37.451 --> 09:38.744
Wait, I'm just getting to the best part.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.621
Then I'm gonna grab his neck
and I'm gonna pull--

09:40.705 --> 09:41.622
Stop it!

09:41.831 --> 09:43.040
Dude, what's up?

09:43.124 --> 09:45.459
I lied, I've never had
an orgasm with Luke! I--

09:48.963 --> 09:49.797
Oh, shit.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.260
Oh.

09:56.178 --> 09:58.306
[sighs] I'm so sorry.

09:58.889 --> 10:01.017
I thought he would have hit the spot,
like, at least once.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.143
You know what they say,

10:02.226 --> 10:05.187
"Even a blind squirrel trips over a nut
every once in a while."

10:05.271 --> 10:06.772
We only had sex six times.

10:08.357 --> 10:09.358
Um... [sighs]

10:09.942 --> 10:12.653
Well, sex orgasms are really hard
for a girl.

10:12.737 --> 10:15.740
I mean, did you ever get close
when he was going down on you?

10:16.240 --> 10:19.619
We only did that one time
and, uh, it didn't feel very good.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.413
One of the guys on his golf team said
that he should say,

10:22.496 --> 10:23.998
"Peanut butter lumberjack,"

10:24.081 --> 10:26.792
and he almost suffocated.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.961
Um, why didn't you tell him what to do?

10:29.045 --> 10:30.921
What? You can't talk
during sexual activities.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.799
What? How else is he supposed to know?

10:33.883 --> 10:35.426
The only reason I came with Miles

10:35.509 --> 10:38.804
is because I told him precisely
how it works when I'm alone.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.556
I literally wrote it down on my iPad

10:40.640 --> 10:42.767
and showed him the notes
in between takes, I mean...

10:45.645 --> 10:47.271
-[gasps]
-Hold on.

10:52.735 --> 10:55.988
Did you ever use that vibrator
that I got you?

10:56.489 --> 10:59.075
Or read any of those articles
on self-pleasure?

10:59.867 --> 11:01.786
They were great
stocking stuffers, truly...

11:04.580 --> 11:06.540
You've never masturbated.

11:07.249 --> 11:08.584
Or had an orgasm.

11:09.043 --> 11:09.877
At all.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.755
No, and don't make fun of me. Or Luke.

11:13.255 --> 11:14.090
We tried.

11:14.465 --> 11:15.883
Hey, it's okay.

11:16.425 --> 11:17.259
No judgment.

11:17.343 --> 11:20.429
It's just...
it's a great use of after-school time

11:20.513 --> 11:23.724
and then also, you get to tell somebody
exactly what it is you like.

11:23.808 --> 11:27.228
I would highly recommend doing it yourself

11:27.311 --> 11:28.646
before you go out on the open road.

11:28.729 --> 11:30.147
Who says I'm going to do that?

11:30.231 --> 11:32.942
Why wouldn't you?
The world is your jizz oyster.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.610
-Ew.
-Look around you.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.696
You can have any guy you want.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.325
I guess I am kind of curious

11:41.409 --> 11:43.411
to see what it's like
to kiss someone else, like...

11:45.454 --> 11:46.497
maybe Darren Boggs?

11:46.580 --> 11:47.456
Yes!

11:48.207 --> 11:50.334
Ooh, or Brett McNease.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.211
You could even touch his butt.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.422
If you could get your hands
around that thing.

11:54.505 --> 11:55.506
It's a monster.

11:55.589 --> 11:57.508
I would never hook up with someone
from school, though,

11:57.591 --> 11:58.843
so I can get called a slut again.

11:58.926 --> 12:01.220
-Mm.
-I mean, me and God are cool.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.641
But the Judgment
of the Willingham student body

12:05.725 --> 12:06.892
is a different story.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.185
[exhales deeply]

12:09.437 --> 12:12.231
Hey, who says
he has to be from this school?

12:16.235 --> 12:17.945
You can scroll through Geekster.

12:22.533 --> 12:25.536
Hey, he's cute in, like,
a Space Camp kind of way.

12:25.619 --> 12:27.079
-[Blair] Hm.
-Always go for the nerds.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.789
They're the ones
who end up being the most successful.

12:28.873 --> 12:31.876
Excuse me!
We plan on making our own money.

12:31.959 --> 12:34.545
Sure, mija, but I don't live
in a zero-sum world.

12:34.920 --> 12:38.215
Money, plus more money,
equals fuck you money.

12:38.799 --> 12:40.176
-[Bowser] All right.
-Yes, it does.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.511
Sent out mailers for free yogurt

12:42.595 --> 12:44.764
to our list of low-rent Dekalb skips.

12:45.347 --> 12:46.599
How do you know they're going to come?

12:46.682 --> 12:49.143
Trust me, I've done this
a bunch of times in Florida.

12:49.226 --> 12:51.061
Criminals are hungry, stupid people.

12:51.145 --> 12:53.022
-That is a hurtful stereotype.
-I'm hungry, and stupid,

12:53.105 --> 12:54.440
-and I'm not a criminal.
-So...

12:54.523 --> 12:57.193
tomorrow, when they show up
with their bogus coupons,

12:57.610 --> 12:58.652
we arrest them.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.988
And then once we get a good-sized group,

13:01.530 --> 13:02.740
we'll load 'em up in here

13:02.823 --> 13:04.200
and off we go to the county jail.

13:05.534 --> 13:06.702
Wait, is that tomorrow?

13:06.952 --> 13:09.747
I started this out with, "So tomorrow."
Yes, Sterling.

13:09.830 --> 13:13.167
Dang it! I thought it was Sunday.
I have my forensics tournament tomorrow.

13:13.417 --> 13:16.295
Your forgetfulness
is disappointing but not surprising.

13:17.338 --> 13:20.591
So here's who the three of us
will be apprehending.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.219
This guy is missing four teeth.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.554
Also, he's only worth 100 dollars.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.224
Well, you don't need teeth for yogurt.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.683
And yes, only a hundred,

13:29.767 --> 13:33.187
but an easy day worth of these folks
is a pretty penny.

13:33.270 --> 13:35.356
Speak for yourself.
A hundred for y'all if you bring him in,

13:35.439 --> 13:37.733
if you don't,
that's negative one-thousand for me.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.735
-[inhales through teeth]
-Wow, your business cycle

13:39.819 --> 13:41.987
really relies on Bowser being good
at his job.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.990
That's why my black book
of bounty hunters is very thick.

13:45.074 --> 13:48.577
I rely on Bowser,
Terrance, Chuck, Perry D,

13:48.661 --> 13:50.704
Michael, Rojelio, Jorge...

13:50.788 --> 13:52.957
Okay, all right.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.334
Enough naming your boyfriends.
I'm your favorite.

13:55.417 --> 13:56.836
Not after this stupid plan.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.337
Stupid? [chuckles]
-Mm-hm.

13:58.420 --> 14:01.048
Instead of wasting whole days
chasing fifty buck skips,

14:01.131 --> 14:02.675
they all come to us in one big bunch.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.009
That's genius if you ask me.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.427
Oh, Einstein.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.347
Mm-hm. You're just mad
'cause you gotta get your hands dirty.

14:08.430 --> 14:09.473
-[chuckles]
-Please.

14:09.557 --> 14:10.933
The old Yolanda used to love that.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.935
-Oh, gross.
-Ooh, like how?

14:13.018 --> 14:15.396
Wrangling drunks in the club. Mm-hm.

14:15.479 --> 14:16.522
[both chuckle]

14:16.605 --> 14:18.190
I was a cop, and she was a bouncer.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.067
-Yeah.
-That's before she got soft.

14:20.150 --> 14:22.987
[gasps] You should talk, Krispy Kreme.

14:23.070 --> 14:25.990
-[Bowser mumbles]
-Although, I do endorse this shirt.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.200
Oh, you got love for Tommy Bahama, huh?

14:28.284 --> 14:30.911
Well, any place that sells a burger
and a blouse is okay with me.

14:31.495 --> 14:33.581
[Yolanda and Bowser chuckle]

14:34.373 --> 14:35.249
What the actual heck?

14:35.332 --> 14:37.167
She's basically
undressing Bowser with her eyes.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.627
I think she was just
complimenting his shirt.

14:38.711 --> 14:39.545
But it's hideous.

14:39.628 --> 14:42.381
She obviously wants to get with him,
sex style.

14:43.173 --> 14:45.342
Sex. She wants to have sex with him

14:45.426 --> 14:46.510
and we need to clear the way.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.345
But wait, he married her sister,

14:48.429 --> 14:49.680
so if he sleeps with Yolanda,

14:49.763 --> 14:51.140
it's like he's sleeping with his sister.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.726
But in reality, Yolanda was already
his former wife's sister

14:53.809 --> 14:55.227
when they did the dirty the first time,

14:55.311 --> 14:57.688
so, technically, they've been doing
an incestuous ménage à trois

14:57.771 --> 14:58.856
this entire time.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.901
Wow, your brain works really quickly
when it comes to intercourse.

15:01.984 --> 15:03.569
Yeah, it does.

15:04.987 --> 15:08.032
Hey Bow-Wow,
I can't attend coupon day either

15:08.115 --> 15:11.327
because I have to go support Sterling
and be her good luck charm.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.703
[gasps] Aw!

15:12.786 --> 15:14.204
I always lose in the first round.

15:14.288 --> 15:16.040
Yeah, that's because I'm never there.

15:16.540 --> 15:20.085
So, I guess you guys are
doing this thing together.

15:20.169 --> 15:23.672
[chuckles] Oh, my gosh.
You guys are so cute.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.008
-[cell phone clicks]
-[Blair] Ohhh.

15:27.593 --> 15:28.802
I'll send it to you.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.264
[gasps]

15:32.348 --> 15:34.558
Oh. [chuckles]

15:34.934 --> 15:36.352
Can I borrow this?

15:37.478 --> 15:39.063
Depends. You gonna bring it back?

15:39.146 --> 15:42.483
If the way I borrow Sterling's bras
is any indication,

15:42.566 --> 15:43.817
probably in two to three years,

15:43.901 --> 15:45.402
and may be stretched out a little bit.

15:46.570 --> 15:47.738
-Fine.
-Thank you.

15:50.741 --> 15:52.034
Thanks for coming with me tomorrow.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.203
I really wouldn't mind
kicking butt for a change.

15:54.286 --> 15:55.245
Don't be weird.

15:55.329 --> 15:57.456
I just said that to give Yolanda
and Bowser time to get busy.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.750
Really, I'm going to hang out with Miles,

15:59.833 --> 16:03.462
make sweet love, and talk about
adult things like the Federal Reserve

16:03.545 --> 16:05.339
-or doing laundry.
-Thrilling.

16:05.422 --> 16:07.633
Hey! Hit me as hard as you can.

16:07.716 --> 16:09.385
It's designed to stop bullets, not hands.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.971
Just pretend that you're an immature
teenage bank robber

16:12.054 --> 16:14.890
and I'm a sexy adult
FBI agent trying to stop you.

16:15.265 --> 16:16.558
Okay, fine!

16:16.642 --> 16:18.394
But I'm a grown-ass bank robber

16:18.477 --> 16:21.480
with an opioid addiction
and a really tragic backstory.

16:21.563 --> 16:23.607
Wait! Opioid addiction isn't funny.

16:23.691 --> 16:26.735
Okay, fine. No addiction, just still
a really tragic backstory, okay?

16:27.194 --> 16:29.238
[both grunting]

16:29.321 --> 16:31.115
I can take you. Oh, my God!

16:31.198 --> 16:32.866
[giggling]

16:34.576 --> 16:35.995
[car approaches]

16:42.084 --> 16:43.419
-Was that Mom?
-I think so!

16:43.502 --> 16:45.421
Did she just see us standing
in front of an RV with bail bonds

16:45.504 --> 16:47.631
-and me in a bulletproof vest?
-Looks like it.

16:47.715 --> 16:48.632
Holy shit.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.134
Oh, we're so busted!

16:50.217 --> 16:52.594
-Mom knows we're bounty hunters!
-Mom thinks we're slacking off at work...

16:52.678 --> 16:53.887
We're bounty hunters!

16:53.971 --> 16:55.472
That's what I was gonna say.

17:03.313 --> 17:05.399
-Hey.
-Oh, hey, Mom. Hope you had a great day.

17:05.482 --> 17:06.859
We totally did. We worked so hard.

17:06.942 --> 17:10.320
Yeah, which you already know since
you saw us outside the yogurt shop today.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.489
Yeah, you should have stopped and said hi.

17:12.573 --> 17:13.407
We would have introduced you

17:13.490 --> 17:16.160
to this wonderful, incredible woman
that Bowser knows.

17:16.243 --> 17:18.412
Her name is Yolanda and she's a nun,

17:18.495 --> 17:22.124
and she drives around delivering yogurt
to underserved youth.

17:22.207 --> 17:24.418
She's bailing out hunger.

17:24.501 --> 17:26.670
[Sterling]
Yeah, while also creating a bond.

17:26.754 --> 17:30.132
You might have also noticed
that new vest that I was sporting.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.843
It's from H&M,
their new Desert Storm collection.

17:32.926 --> 17:33.969
What a deal.

17:34.053 --> 17:34.970
[forced chuckle]

17:37.056 --> 17:39.266
Right. Well, yeah,
and I would have stopped myself,

17:39.349 --> 17:41.226
but I was having drinks
with the girls across town

17:41.310 --> 17:43.020
and I was in a big hurry. [chuckles]

17:43.103 --> 17:45.189
She got a promotion, Sheila did,
so we were celebrating.

17:45.272 --> 17:46.857
Anyway... Um...

17:49.068 --> 17:52.821
I know that I've been acting... [giggles]
stressed out lately,

17:52.905 --> 17:55.991
but I want you both to know
we are all good here.

17:56.492 --> 17:57.993
-Okay?
-Okay.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.703
Okay. Come here.

17:59.787 --> 18:00.621
[chuckles]

18:00.704 --> 18:01.538
[kissing]

18:02.414 --> 18:03.248
Love y'all.

18:09.963 --> 18:11.340
She was lying.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.425
No, she wasn't. You're so dramatic.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.803
Lack of eye contact,
quickly changing the subject,

18:15.886 --> 18:17.513
and since when does Mom ride in an Uber?

18:17.596 --> 18:19.973
She says that she hates them
because they smell like people.

18:21.308 --> 18:23.227
What does Mom have to lie about?

18:23.310 --> 18:25.646
I don't know,
but she's obviously hiding something.

18:25.729 --> 18:27.231
We just have to figure out what it is.

18:27.648 --> 18:28.649
No, we don't.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.110
We both know Mom can be
a bit much sometimes

18:31.193 --> 18:33.904
but actually, with all things considered,
she's been pretty cool to me lately,

18:33.987 --> 18:35.697
and I think that she deserves
the benefit of the doubt.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.366
Of course she's been cool to you.

18:37.449 --> 18:38.617
You're her favorite.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.202
I don't have that luxury.

18:40.702 --> 18:42.663
I can see her way more clearly
than you can.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.666
You're... a parakeet
living in her gilded cage.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.793
I look nothing like a parakeet.

18:47.876 --> 18:50.712
An eagle maybe,
or, like, a really pretty hawk.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.674
Nope. You're a tiny blonde parakeet

18:53.757 --> 18:55.467
and I'm a sexy, wise raven

18:55.551 --> 18:58.846
living outside the cage
with no access to bird food or water.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.056
She's up to something.

19:01.849 --> 19:02.850
I'm gonna figure out what.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.270
Wow, you are really taking this
"sex-gave-me-X-ray-vision" thing

19:06.353 --> 19:07.229
to a whole new level.

19:07.312 --> 19:09.314
It's right there
in front of our faces, Sterl.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.733
Or you're making it up out of boredom,

19:11.817 --> 19:13.443
like that summer the pool shut down

19:13.527 --> 19:16.697
and you thought that Mrs. Miller
across the street was burying a body.

19:16.947 --> 19:19.449
[grunts]
Who gardens at one in the morning?

19:19.533 --> 19:20.534
Like, nobody!

19:24.538 --> 19:26.456
[people chattering]

19:39.052 --> 19:41.471
Sterling! You look amazing.

19:41.555 --> 19:42.848
I know you're gonna do great today.

19:42.931 --> 19:43.849
And I...

19:45.017 --> 19:46.018
[groans] I can't.

19:46.101 --> 19:48.437
I attempted to picture you
as someone I love and respect,

19:48.520 --> 19:49.980
but it's too much work.

19:50.063 --> 19:51.773
-Even God rested on the seventh day.
-Wu! Wu!

19:51.857 --> 19:55.777
Wu! Wu! Wu! Wu! Wu! Wu!

19:55.861 --> 19:57.654
Wu! Wu! Wu!

19:57.738 --> 20:00.407
There he is. Craig Wu.

20:00.949 --> 20:03.577
Last year's champion,
this year's roadkill.

20:04.077 --> 20:06.830
And not the cute kind
where they look like they're sleeping.

20:09.708 --> 20:10.792
[exhales deeply]

20:13.253 --> 20:15.255
[people chattering]

20:17.841 --> 20:18.675
Hey.

20:24.848 --> 20:25.891
[cell phone ringing]

20:25.974 --> 20:27.059
-[Blair] Hey.
-Hey.

20:28.518 --> 20:30.812
Um, I don't know if I could
do this whole Geekster thing.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.981
I mean, I'm excited to explore but I--

20:33.065 --> 20:35.108
But nothing. Just pick one and hop on.

20:35.484 --> 20:36.652
Okay. What does that even mean?

20:36.735 --> 20:38.570
It means don't overthink it.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.447
You've never even kissed another guy.

20:40.530 --> 20:41.740
Just experiment.

20:42.282 --> 20:43.367
You're in the driver's seat.

20:43.617 --> 20:44.451
What?

20:45.160 --> 20:46.954
Am I just supposed to walk up
to one of these guys

20:47.037 --> 20:48.872
and be, like,
"Hey, do you want to make out with me?"

20:51.291 --> 20:52.209
Whoa.

20:52.292 --> 20:53.460
Your tongue is scratchy.

20:53.543 --> 20:55.963
Like a cat's.

20:57.756 --> 20:58.590
Did you like it?

20:59.216 --> 21:00.509
Yeah, I did.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.388
Wow. Thank you for broadening my horizons.

21:04.471 --> 21:05.722
Good luck on your debate.

21:15.482 --> 21:16.316
Welcome.

21:18.151 --> 21:18.986
Morning.

21:19.569 --> 21:21.863
I'm here for my free yogurt.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.408
-Do you have your coupon?
-Yes, sir. Got it right here.

21:24.491 --> 21:25.325
Uh-huh.

21:25.409 --> 21:28.745
Well, if you just follow me into my office
and fill out some paperwork,

21:28.829 --> 21:30.080
we'll get you your yogurt.

21:30.664 --> 21:31.665
[chuckles]

21:34.835 --> 21:36.378
Welcome to the party, my bro.

21:36.878 --> 21:38.880
I'm gonna sue y'all, I really am.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.968
Do I still get the yogurt?

21:43.051 --> 21:45.053
Sure, we'll give it to you
on your way to jail.

21:48.932 --> 21:51.643
I mean, everybody's parents have stuff
they don't want you to know about.

21:51.727 --> 21:54.229
Doesn't mean it's all secret,
evil Darth Vader stuff.

21:54.771 --> 21:55.647
Then why hide it?

21:55.731 --> 21:58.608
Look, if she's spending
this much energy lying about it,

21:58.692 --> 22:00.444
it must be serious.

22:00.694 --> 22:01.987
Not necessarily.

22:02.279 --> 22:03.238
Take my mom,

22:03.697 --> 22:07.242
the first and only African-American
female senator from our district.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.244
-Mm-hm.
-Check it, she doesn't know I know this

22:09.828 --> 22:12.372
but before her last election,
she went to a tanning salon.

22:12.456 --> 22:13.457
What?

22:13.665 --> 22:15.959
Her media consultant
said that her skin tone

22:16.043 --> 22:17.753
polls differently in different regions

22:17.836 --> 22:19.338
based on the socio-economic makeup.

22:19.421 --> 22:20.839
-I--
-Yeah, I don't know.

22:20.922 --> 22:22.007
She had this big debate coming up.

22:22.090 --> 22:24.676
Let's just say she went
from latte to mocha.

22:24.885 --> 22:27.137
By the time we got to Bankhead,
she was black, no sugar.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.805
-No! [laughs]
-[approaching footsteps]

22:30.932 --> 22:32.351
Well, hello there, Miles.

22:32.434 --> 22:34.269
I didn't know that you two
were here...

22:35.354 --> 22:36.813
alone. Hm.

22:37.564 --> 22:39.107
Seems like I could have gotten
a text about that.

22:39.191 --> 22:42.652
Uh, Dad's out back in the wood shop
whittling ducks.

22:42.903 --> 22:44.237
Good, money right in our pockets.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.656
Well, hello, Miss Wesley.
You look very nice today.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.200
Oh, well, thank you.

22:48.283 --> 22:50.660
You certainly know how to flatter.
[chuckles]

22:50.744 --> 22:52.954
You must get that from your mother.
Always campaigning?

22:53.038 --> 22:55.457
You know, I know that your mother
and I have different politics.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.167
Oh, Lord, that straw ban...

22:57.751 --> 23:00.420
Makes it impossible to drink an iced latte
without messing up my lipstick,

23:00.504 --> 23:02.339
but, nonetheless, I am so glad

23:02.422 --> 23:04.674
that Blair can be around
different kinds of people and...

23:05.509 --> 23:08.595
absorb... er-- different cultures.
[chuckles]

23:08.678 --> 23:11.973
Oh. Uh, yes.
It's such a complete pleasure to be...

23:12.599 --> 23:14.267
black in front of your daughter.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.437
Good.

23:17.521 --> 23:18.772
Good.

23:18.855 --> 23:22.526
Um, I'm gonna run out
and go do some errands. And you two?

23:22.609 --> 23:24.569
We're just gonna hang out...

23:24.945 --> 23:27.489
and watch cartoons.

23:27.572 --> 23:28.949
You know, childlike things.

23:29.032 --> 23:31.118
Well, I'll be back in a little bit.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.161
Oh, and, uh...

23:35.997 --> 23:36.832
[clicks teeth]

23:36.915 --> 23:38.083
Leave room for Jesus.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.251
-Yeah.
-Oh.

23:39.334 --> 23:40.168
Got it.

23:42.754 --> 23:43.672
[Blair] Bye.

23:43.755 --> 23:44.881
[Debbie] Bye!

23:45.882 --> 23:47.008
Let's go.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.552
-What? Go where?
-[door shuts]

23:48.635 --> 23:49.678
We're going to follow her.

23:49.761 --> 23:51.847
She's up to something
and I want to figure out what it is.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.515
Do we really have to be spies and shit?

23:53.598 --> 23:54.891
I just wanted to kick it.

23:55.892 --> 23:56.852
Think about it this way.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.146
We actually are spies,

23:59.229 --> 24:01.481
and we're on a super dangerous mission

24:01.565 --> 24:02.983
to bring us closer...

24:04.276 --> 24:05.444
and closer.

24:08.029 --> 24:10.782
It is very hard to argue with you.

24:11.366 --> 24:12.451
Mm-hm.

24:13.869 --> 24:16.997
And you get to absorb
more of my culture on the way.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.000
Please erase that interaction
from your memory.

24:20.083 --> 24:21.793
Mm-mm, no. It's already ingrained.

24:22.752 --> 24:23.587
Please!

24:24.546 --> 24:26.089
[tapping over loudspeaker]

24:26.173 --> 24:27.716
Good morning, everyone.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.552
And welcome to Willingham Academy

24:30.635 --> 24:35.223
for the Southeastern Semi-Quarter
Regional Forensics Tournament!

24:35.307 --> 24:36.141
[chuckles]

24:39.144 --> 24:40.896
Whoo!

24:41.438 --> 24:42.272
Okay.

24:42.355 --> 24:45.192
Now, today's topic is:

24:45.275 --> 24:48.528
Should governments be held responsible

24:48.612 --> 24:50.280
for economic reparations

24:50.363 --> 24:53.992
for their own country's
historical injustices.

24:54.117 --> 24:56.328
I'm about to text everyone

24:56.411 --> 24:59.080

and their opponents

25:09.382 --> 25:11.176
[Ellen] Whoo! Let's debate!

25:12.427 --> 25:14.346
Remember,
you're the affirmative in this round

25:14.429 --> 25:16.431
so affirm that dude's place in hell.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.141
-Crusader-style!
-Got it, coach.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.852
I know cross usually trips you up,

25:20.936 --> 25:23.522
but don't focus on the curveball.

25:24.356 --> 25:27.150
Just lean into it. Move when he moves.

25:27.234 --> 25:28.360
Dance with him.

25:29.277 --> 25:30.111
Sweet moves.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.240
Why are you so relaxed?

25:33.323 --> 25:35.951
You're usually crying hysterically by now.

25:36.034 --> 25:39.579
I don't know, just feeling
as chill as a scratchy-tongued cat.

25:40.664 --> 25:41.665
I don't know what that means.

25:41.748 --> 25:42.791
Neither do I.

25:43.041 --> 25:43.875
Just win.

25:48.838 --> 25:49.839
Hello, opponent.

25:54.511 --> 25:55.387
[timer starts ticking]

25:55.470 --> 25:57.347
I affirm that government
should be responsible

25:57.430 --> 26:00.767
for economic reparations
for their country's historic injustices.

26:01.059 --> 26:02.602
Throughout our shared global history,

26:02.686 --> 26:05.355
crimes against humanity
have had unintended consequences

26:05.438 --> 26:06.356
that have yet to be remedied...

26:06.439 --> 26:07.524
My opponent has made some valid points,

26:07.607 --> 26:09.734
and sure, in theory,
reparations are great.

26:10.860 --> 26:12.946
But who decides
the definition of an atrocity?

26:13.238 --> 26:14.906
Well, let's start with six million Jews,

26:14.990 --> 26:17.158
fifty million Africans who died
in the Middle Passage,

26:17.242 --> 26:18.785
and the genocide of the American Indians.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.663
Are you saying the nature of these horrors
are up for debate?

26:21.997 --> 26:23.540
No, no, no, no, no,
that's not what I'm saying.

26:23.623 --> 26:26.042
You-- You--
You can't debate these kind of...

26:27.460 --> 26:29.671
[alarm beeps]

26:29.754 --> 26:31.089
-[beeping stops]
-Time.

26:38.388 --> 26:39.347
[sighs]

26:40.473 --> 26:42.767
I won. I actually made it through
the first round.

26:42.851 --> 26:46.104
Oh. I've never thought I would say this
to you at one of these tournaments,

26:46.187 --> 26:48.148
but congratulations.

26:48.231 --> 26:49.065
Thank you.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.026
Are you on Ritalin or something?

26:51.109 --> 26:53.236

26:53.320 --> 26:54.321
No, why?

Just hitting my stride, I guess.

27:03.079 --> 27:03.997
Uh, my dudes.

27:04.372 --> 27:05.665
Could I trouble you for some water?

27:05.749 --> 27:07.876
Yeah, you got to give us water.

27:08.585 --> 27:09.836
Basic human right.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.630

30:16.815 --> 30:17.649
It's all fine.

30:18.316 --> 30:20.318
I'm still the team's first
white female captain,

30:20.401 --> 30:22.487
and we... are still going to win.

30:22.570 --> 30:25.073
How? If Craig beat you,
what chance do I have?

30:26.616 --> 30:27.867
[exhales deeply]

30:27.951 --> 30:29.953
You were
never supposed to make it this far.

30:30.036 --> 30:31.913
So, he doesn't have a dossier on you.

30:32.622 --> 30:35.583
Your being a giant nobody
has finally paid off.

30:35.667 --> 30:36.501
Thanks?

30:36.584 --> 30:39.295
All you have to do
is use this last bit of dirt.

30:39.504 --> 30:41.464
It'll be the final nail in his coffin.

30:44.634 --> 30:46.761
H-- His mom slept with her trainer?

30:46.845 --> 30:47.887
How do you know this?

30:48.471 --> 30:49.639
I lift. I asked around.

30:50.265 --> 30:51.099
Okay...

30:51.808 --> 30:53.768
Um... How am I supposed to use this?

30:53.893 --> 30:54.811
He's the affirmative.

30:54.894 --> 30:57.230
Part of his case is built on
the personal anecdote

30:57.313 --> 30:58.523
of his parents' divorce.

30:58.606 --> 30:59.816
It's that weird thing

30:59.899 --> 31:02.110
where you appear vulnerable
to appear strong.

31:02.193 --> 31:03.653
He'll give you the opening you need.

31:04.153 --> 31:05.822
I don't know if I can stoop that low.

31:06.823 --> 31:07.949
He did it to me.

31:08.950 --> 31:11.411
Besides, stooping low is something

31:11.494 --> 31:14.163
you've proven yourself
very capable of in the past.

31:14.247 --> 31:15.623
What's that supposed to mean?

31:15.707 --> 31:18.668
Oh, please.
Back when we were friends in fifth grade

31:18.751 --> 31:21.296
and you gave me away
to Jessica's group at recess.

31:22.422 --> 31:23.548
What are you talking about?

31:24.048 --> 31:24.883
You...

31:24.966 --> 31:27.635
We just stopped hanging out
and you started hanging out with Jessica

31:27.719 --> 31:29.387
because you had more in common with her.

31:30.889 --> 31:31.723
No.

31:32.223 --> 31:36.603
You very specifically
and intentionally gave me away.

31:36.853 --> 31:39.814
You, and Blair, and Hannah S, and Hannah G
were playing soccer

31:39.898 --> 31:42.942
and I was going to sit on the swings
and memorize the Republican presidents.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.277
Then you came up to me.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.112
You took me over to Jessica

31:46.195 --> 31:48.531
and you said, "April's in your group now."

31:50.199 --> 31:51.534
And then you walked away.

31:52.118 --> 31:53.786
I don't remember it like that.

31:54.954 --> 31:55.788
I do.

31:58.666 --> 32:00.335
I don't know-- I don't know what to say.

32:01.169 --> 32:04.505
If that's true, then I'm so sorry.

32:06.841 --> 32:07.675
It doesn't matter.

32:08.551 --> 32:09.761
The past is the past.

32:10.428 --> 32:11.679
We're all adults here.

32:12.096 --> 32:14.390
-No, April. I want to talk about it.
-We just did.

32:16.851 --> 32:17.727
So...

32:19.437 --> 32:21.606
if you have a shred of decency,

32:21.689 --> 32:23.775
you will bring up
this boy's philandering mother

32:23.858 --> 32:25.610
in front of his friends and family.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.037
[ducks quacking]

32:37.413 --> 32:39.165
I am so bored right now.

32:39.749 --> 32:41.084
I can feel my hair growing.

32:41.542 --> 32:43.670
Either she starts selling drugs
in the next five minutes,

32:43.753 --> 32:44.879
or I'm going to run her over.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.794
I promised my mom I'd help stuff flyers.

33:24.877 --> 33:25.712
I'm sorry.

33:25.795 --> 33:27.255
We didn't even get to the end
of the mission

33:27.338 --> 33:30.008
where we get to, like,
bang in Thailand.

33:30.091 --> 33:32.260

that's what tomorrows are for.

-Yeah.

33:33.761 --> 33:34.846

33:34.929 --> 33:36.681
Okay. Only if you wear it.

-You want me to drive you home?
-No, the MARTA's right there.

-Did I have a choice?

[both chuckle]

35:18.658 --> 35:20.743
Easy day, my ass.

35:20.827 --> 35:22.745
Quit your bellyaching. You had fun.

35:22.912 --> 35:25.123
Maybe. I guess we don't make
a half bad team.

35:25.206 --> 35:26.958
Yeah, I always thought so.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.376
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.128
You have a funny way of showing it.

35:30.211 --> 35:32.380
You're saying I'm funny? Thank you.

with me that one and only night,

35:39.762 --> 35:41.264
why didn't you lock it down?

35:43.641 --> 35:44.892
Why didn't you ask me to?

35:45.852 --> 35:46.853
I had to ask?

35:46.936 --> 35:48.646
Well, I'm not a mind reader,

35:48.729 --> 35:50.731
and you wasn't emmitin'

35:50.815 --> 35:52.066
And my sister was?

35:52.150 --> 35:54.360
She at least acted like
she was interested.

35:54.443 --> 35:55.278
Oh, please.

35:55.361 --> 35:58.197
Miss Michelle was probably
still coming down from Burning Man.

35:58.281 --> 36:01.534
Well, then you should have asked her
to save you a hit of whatever it was.

36:01.617 --> 36:05.163
-And that would have changed things?
-I don't know, I can't time travel.

36:05.246 --> 36:06.414

36:07.456 --> 36:09.000
-You know...
-Mm-hm.

36:09.083 --> 36:11.752
if you keep reminding me
of all the super powers I don't have...

36:11.836 --> 36:14.088
-Yes?
-...you'll miss the ones I do have.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.631

36:15.715 --> 36:16.883

36:16.966 --> 36:19.802

I can see through shit.

36:24.223 --> 36:26.017

-Yes, I can!

36:28.186 --> 36:29.478
[sighs]

36:31.189 --> 36:32.899
So, how is Michelle doing anyway?

36:37.945 --> 36:38.779
Fine.

36:38.946 --> 36:40.198
-Yeah?
-Mm-hm.

36:40.740 --> 36:41.699
What is she up to?

36:43.492 --> 36:44.911
-You know Michelle.
-Mm-hm.

36:44.994 --> 36:46.579
She's either visiting an ostrich farm

36:46.662 --> 36:48.497
or trying to become an astronaut.

36:48.581 --> 36:53.336
[chuckles] Yeah. She tried to convince me
once to grow crystals in our bathroom.

36:55.880 --> 36:56.797

36:57.340 --> 36:58.216
I should get going.

36:59.592 --> 37:00.635
Hey, are you sure?

37:01.469 --> 37:03.471
Yeah. Tow truck will be showing up soon.

37:04.096 --> 37:05.640
My whole life's in that thing.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.396
Yes, but in a hyper-capitalist framework,

37:12.480 --> 37:15.524
reparations would be counter-intuitive
to a nation's productivity.

37:15.608 --> 37:18.527
I'd contend that a nation's productivity
would improve

37:18.611 --> 37:21.280
if its citizens could endorse
their government's morality.

37:21.364 --> 37:22.865
Isn't that what this is all about, anyway?

37:22.949 --> 37:24.158
What's right and what's wrong?

37:24.242 --> 37:26.410
Take my parents, for example.

37:26.827 --> 37:27.870
They got divorced.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.122
It was amicable.

37:30.915 --> 37:34.835
But only because my father
made reparations to my mother

37:34.919 --> 37:37.213
for being absent for many years.

37:37.296 --> 37:39.632
So you're contending that your mother
was the victim?

37:39.715 --> 37:42.510
I-- I guess, but I mean
that the situation was resolved

37:42.593 --> 37:45.012
because one party admitted guilt.

37:47.556 --> 37:48.516
One party?

37:49.225 --> 37:55.064
My point is that institutions
as small as families and as big as nations

37:55.147 --> 37:57.733
can only move on with the truth.

37:57.817 --> 38:00.069
I mean, don't you think when someone
was wronged in the past

38:00.152 --> 38:03.948
that the offending party has an obligation
to address that grievance?

38:04.407 --> 38:05.825
Even if it's years later?

38:18.421 --> 38:19.630
You make a great point.

the trainer hammer?

and I just couldn't do it.

38:40.359 --> 38:42.153

38:42.236 --> 38:43.863

and you screwed me over now.

could get worse.
