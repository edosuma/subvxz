01:36.797 --> 01:39.365
Tonight, a country brought to its knees.

01:39.366 --> 01:43.102
<i>A 7.2 magnitude earthquake
has hit Haiti.</i>

01:43.103 --> 01:46.105
<i>The capital, Port-au-Prince,
was literally torn apart.</i>

01:46.106 --> 01:47.873
<i>The earthquake lasted
all of a minute.</i>

01:47.874 --> 01:49.508
<i>The intensity so strong,</i>

01:49.509 --> 01:52.411
<i>within seconds a cloud of dust
covered the city.</i>

01:52.412 --> 01:55.114
<i>And many people are still
trapped in the rubble.</i>

01:55.115 --> 01:59.251
<i>Some may still be alive,</i>

01:59.252 --> 02:01.420
<i>but getting out alive will be
There's truly no way of knowing</i>

02:01.421 --> 02:03.489
<i>just how many people are dead.</i>

02:03.490 --> 02:06.392
<i>Bodies are reportedly stacked
in streets.</i>

02:06.393 --> 02:07.760
<i>It's feared the number
of people killed</i>

02:07.761 --> 02:10.262
<i>could now reach 200,000.</i>

02:10.263 --> 02:13.265
200,000 children without
a mother or father

02:13.266 --> 02:15.434
<i>even before this earthquake.</i>

02:15.435 --> 02:18.304
A country which only seems
to know the worst of times

02:18.305 --> 02:20.306
<i>is tonight just
trying to survive.
</i> - Mama! Mama!

02:20.307 --> 02:23.309
<i>But it is the human losses
which are most shocking.</i>

02:23.310 --> 02:24.410
Mama! Mama!

02:47.367 --> 02:48.734
"My name is Nina.

02:48.735 --> 02:51.203
I am seven years old."

03:41.455 --> 03:43.789
<i>I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE

COME ON.

04:40.514 --> 04:43.415

ALL I NEED IS ONE MORE WEEK

06:28.622 --> 06:31.657
OH, I DON'T KNOW THAT
THAT'S NECESSARY.

06:31.658 --> 06:32.892
IN FACT, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE IT'S BETTER

06:32.893 --> 06:34.860

29:09.748 --> 29:11.082
- OH MY GOD, STEVEN!
- ...NOT TO WORRY.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.084
- SIR? SIR?
- THE POOL!

29:13.085 --> 29:15.086
- SHE'S IN THE POOL!
- SIR?

29:24.129 --> 29:26.163
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.

29:26.164 --> 29:27.531
SOMEONE ON YOUR STAFF
HAD TO SEE HER.

29:30.168 --> 29:32.303
MR. MAYER,
THERE'S CERTAIN PROTOCOL

29:32.304 --> 29:35.206
THAT WE FOLLOW HERE,
AND WE'RE DOING THAT.

29:35.207 --> 29:37.975
GETTING ANGRY WITH THE STAFF?
IT'S NOT GONNA HELP.

29:37.976 --> 29:40.177
- WHAT ABOUT SECURITY FOOTAGE?
- WE'RE LOOKING INTO THAT.

29:40.178 --> 29:42.113
SHE CAN'T HAVE
JUST DISAPPEARED.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.281
CHILDREN DO WANDER OFF.

29:44.282 --> 29:45.516
WHAT?

29:45.517 --> 29:48.486
A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD
WITH A COMPLEX PAST,

29:48.487 --> 29:50.054
BRAND NEW SET
OF CIRCUMSTANCES,

29:50.055 --> 29:53.090
BEWILDERED,
OVERWHELMED.

29:53.091 --> 29:55.826
WE'RE LOOKING INTOnEVERY POSSIBILITY.

29:55.827 --> 29:57.962
AND CONSIDERING
THE CONFLICT THE OTHER NIGHT,

29:57.963 --> 29:59.930
WE HAVE
TO INVESTIGATE THAT.

29:59.931 --> 30:02.299
CAN YOU MAKE A LIST
OF OTHER PLACES YOU'VE BEEN

30:02.300 --> 30:04.969
SINCE YOU ARRIVED
AND THE PEOPLE THAT YOU MET?

30:04.970 --> 30:08.039
AND ALSO, DO YOU HAVE
ANY PHOTOS OF NINA?

30:08.040 --> 30:09.440
I'LL GET MY COMPUTER.

30:09.441 --> 30:10.441
IF SHE DID
WANDER OFF ALONE,

30:12.110 --> 30:14.578
SHE'S PROBABLY OUT THERE
HUNGRY BY NOW.

30:14.579 --> 30:15.413
SOMEONE HAS TO NOTICEnA LITTLE GIRL ALL ALONE.

30:18.083 --> 30:20.017
WHAT ABOUT
THE ADOPTION AGENCY?

30:21.887 --> 30:24.255
- HOW WELL DID THEY KNOW HER?
- WE'VE BEEN CALLING THEM.

30:24.256 --> 30:27.124
WE'RE WAITING FOR NINA'S
PASSPORT TO COME THROUGH.

30:27.125 --> 30:29.927
THEY DIDN'T ANSWER YESTERDAY.

30:29.928 --> 30:32.830
I'M TRYING TO BRING
UP HER PROFILE PICTURE
ON THE WEBSITE, BUT...

30:32.831 --> 30:34.131
THERE'S NO WEBSITE.

30:36.601 --> 30:40.037
HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY
FOR THIS ADOPTION?

30:43.041 --> 30:44.341
UH...

30:44.342 --> 30:46.110
$60,000.

30:51.917 --> 30:53.984
EXCUSE ME.

30:53.985 --> 30:55.352
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

30:55.353 --> 30:58.155
I'M SORRY.

31:17.309 --> 31:19.944
WE'VE BEEN PARENTS
FOR 48 HOURS.

31:19.945 --> 31:22.913
SHE COULDN'T HAVE
WALKED OUT ON US,
COULD SHE?

31:22.914 --> 31:24.181
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

31:24.182 --> 31:26.617
I MEAN, SHE COULDN'T HAVE
WANTED TO, RIGHT?

31:26.618 --> 31:28.152
SHE SEEMED SO HAPPY.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.423
ALL I EVER WANTED TO BE
WAS A MOTHER.

31:36.128 --> 31:37.228
PRETEND WITH
MY LITTLE SISTER,

31:37.229 --> 31:40.397
I'D... BATHE HER
AND FEED HER

31:40.398 --> 31:42.066
AND TUCK HER IN AT NIGHT.

31:42.067 --> 31:43.267
I SWORE THAT WHEN
I HAD KIDS OF MY OWN

31:46.371 --> 31:49.039
I WOULD NEVER
ABANDON THEM

31:49.040 --> 31:50.407
THE WAY THAT
MY BIRTH MOTHER--

31:50.408 --> 31:53.077
MOTHER ABANDONED ME.

31:53.078 --> 31:54.378
SO WE HAVE TO FIND HER, OKAY?

31:54.379 --> 31:56.113
WE WILL, OKAY?
WE WILL.

31:56.114 --> 31:57.114
I JUST--
BECAUSE--

31:59.117 --> 32:01.085
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO, STEVEN,

32:01.086 --> 32:03.954
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHERE SHE IS.

32:03.955 --> 32:06.590
I'M GOING BACK
TO THAT OFFICE.

32:06.591 --> 32:08.159
YOU THINK THAT
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?

32:08.160 --> 32:09.160
NO ONE'S ANSWERING
THE PHONE,

32:09.161 --> 32:10.661
THE WEBSITE'S DOWN.

32:10.662 --> 32:12.163
I'M GONNA GO
CONFRONT HER DIRECTLY.

32:12.164 --> 32:14.131
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST LET
THE COPS HANDLE THAT.

32:14.132 --> 32:15.533
THE COPS DON'T CARE,
SHANNON.

32:15.534 --> 32:17.168
WE'RE TOURISTS.

32:17.169 --> 32:19.103
THEY GOT ENOUGH PROBLEMS
OF THEIR OWN.

32:19.104 --> 32:22.439
- JUST-- JUST KEEP LOOKING.
- OKAY, GO. I'LL KEEP
LOOKING, OKAY.

32:59.377 --> 33:02.413
<i>WHAT THE FUCK?</i>

33:09.387 --> 33:11.055
<i>NINA?</i>

33:11.056 --> 33:12.056
<i>PERDON.</i>

33:30.408 --> 33:31.475
- YEAH.

33:31.476 --> 33:33.777
- MRS. MAYER.
- YOU HAD SOME NEW INFO?

33:33.778 --> 33:36.747
WELL, WE CONTACTED
THE CONSULATE

33:36.748 --> 33:39.383
AND YOUR PAPERWORK
WAS NEVER PROCESSED.

33:39.384 --> 33:41.218
NO GABRIELLE REIGERT

33:43.188 --> 33:43.354
OR NINA DUVALIER.

33:45.323 --> 33:47.691
THAT HAS TO BE A MISTAKE.

33:49.361 --> 33:50.427
LET ME GUESS.

33:50.428 --> 33:52.162
SHE TOLD YOU
SHE WOULD CONTACT YOU

33:52.163 --> 33:54.098
WHEN YOUR PASSPORT
CAME IN,

33:54.099 --> 33:56.300
SO ALL NINA HAD TO DO
WAS WANDER OFF

33:56.301 --> 33:58.435
AT THE APPOINTED TIME
INTO HER WAITING ARMS.

33:58.436 --> 34:00.537
NO, UM...

34:00.538 --> 34:01.705
NO, OUR ROOM WAS LOCKED.

34:03.275 --> 34:04.508
WE WOULD'VE HEARD
THE DOOR OPEN.

34:04.509 --> 34:07.177
THE SCAM
IS CALLED RECLAIMING.

34:07.178 --> 34:09.246
AND, UNFORTUNATELY,
IT'S NOT RARE.

34:09.246 --> 34:10.281
WHAT THEY DO,

34:10.282 --> 34:12.549
THEY GET AS MUCH MONEY
AS THEY CAN,

34:12.550 --> 34:14.051
TAKE THE KID BACK,

34:14.052 --> 34:15.619
ON TO THE NEXT VICTIM.

34:15.620 --> 34:18.522
NEW WEB SITE,
NEW CITY, NEW COUNTRY.

34:18.523 --> 34:22.059
- IT'S VERY HARD TO TRACK.
IT'S ALL OVER ASIA NOW.
- THIS WEBSITE HAD, UM--

34:22.060 --> 34:23.293
IT HAD ALL THESE, UH,

34:23.295 --> 34:25.295
LINKS,
AND IT HAD TESTIMONIALS.

34:25.297 --> 34:28.364
WELL, WEBSITES
WILL DO THAT.

34:28.366 --> 34:29.466
WHERE'S YOUR HUSBAND?

34:29.467 --> 34:31.101
SIR, SIR...

34:33.538 --> 34:35.371
NO, NO.

34:35.373 --> 34:38.242
UH, JUST KEEP THAT.
THANK YOU.

34:38.243 --> 34:39.842
<i>I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY.</i>

34:39.844 --> 34:41.679
<i>HE'S OUT LOOKING FOR HER.</i>

34:41.679 --> 34:45.349
YEAH, WE HEARD ABOUT
A BREAK-IN IN OLD SAN JUAN.

34:45.350 --> 34:46.317
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

34:48.386 --> 34:51.388
WE DON'T NEED VIGILANTES.

34:51.389 --> 34:53.090
WE'RE GONNA FIND THE GIRL.

34:53.091 --> 34:56.360
COMANDANTE, THIS, UM--

34:56.360 --> 34:58.462
THIS SCAM THAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT...

34:58.463 --> 35:00.631
IT MIGHT BE TRUE...

35:02.267 --> 35:03.233
BUT IT ALSO MIGHT NOT BE.

35:06.304 --> 35:07.538
- SO YOU HAVE TO
KEEP LOOKING FOR HER.
- WE WILL KEEP LOOKING.

35:10.475 --> 35:12.276
- YOU HAVE TO FIND HER.
- WE WILL.

35:23.822 --> 35:25.756
SORRY, HAVE YOU
SEEN THIS LITTLE GIRL?

35:27.425 --> 35:30.627
SORRY, I'M JUST LOOKING
FOR THIS LITTLE GIRL.

35:34.899 --> 35:36.800
ESTA NIÃA.
UM, HAVE YOU SEEN HER?

35:36.801 --> 35:39.370
<i>ESTA NIÃA.
</i> CAN YOU-- NO,
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER?

35:39.371 --> 35:41.872
THIS LITTLE GIRL,nHAVE YOU SEEN HER?

35:53.885 --> 35:55.586
I DID A REALLY
STUPID THING, SHANNON.

35:56.388 --> 35:59.857
WE DID A STUPID THING.

36:01.726 --> 36:03.827
NO, I DID.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.896
YOU LOOKED SO HAPPY.

36:08.299 --> 36:10.401
WE JUST FINISHED
PAINTING HER ROOM.

36:10.402 --> 36:11.802
EVERYTHING WAS SET.

36:11.803 --> 36:12.803
AND THEN I GET
AN EMAIL OUT OF NOWHERE

36:14.305 --> 36:15.739
SAYING THE WHOLE THING
FELL APART.

36:15.740 --> 36:18.475
WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

36:18.476 --> 36:20.477
SHE SAID SHE COULD
MAKE IT GO AWAY.

36:21.913 --> 36:24.248
SHE-- SHE SAID
NO ONE WOULD KNOW...

36:24.249 --> 36:25.482
SO I PAID HER.

36:27.452 --> 36:28.752
WE'D ALREADY PAID.

36:29.788 --> 36:31.555
I PAID HER MORE
TO MAKE IT WORK.

36:31.556 --> 36:33.190
HOW MUCH MORE?

36:33.191 --> 36:33.357
ANOTHER 30.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.361
FUCK.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.330
FUCK, STEVEN.

36:44.302 --> 36:46.336
STEVEN, YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU BOUGHT OUR DAUGHTER
ON THE BLACK MARKET.

36:46.337 --> 36:47.838
NO, NO. NO.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.540
SHE WAS
AN OFFICIAL EXPEDITOR, SHANNON.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.508
SHE HAD--
YOU SAW HER CREDENTIALS,

36:51.509 --> 36:53.410
AND THAT OFFICE.

36:53.411 --> 36:55.512
BABY, WE WERE SO CLOSE.
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

36:55.513 --> 36:58.449
WHAT ABOUT RUN IT BY ME?
COMMUNICATE?

36:58.450 --> 37:00.484
I WANTED EVERYTHING
TO WORK OUT.

37:00.485 --> 37:01.552
AND SO WHAT?
YOU DECIDED THAT YOU WOULD

37:01.553 --> 37:02.786
JUST TAKE SHORTCUTS
AS USUAL?

37:02.787 --> 37:05.389
WE WERE ON A WAITING LIST
BACK HOME, REMEMBER?

37:05.390 --> 37:07.858
ANOTHER TWO
TO THREE MORE YEARS.
I WAS FINE TO WAIT.

37:07.859 --> 37:09.860
OH, SURE,
YOU WERE FINE TO WAIT.

37:13.865 --> 37:16.333
IF YOU ALREADY PAID HER,

37:16.334 --> 37:17.434
WHY DIDN'T
SHE JUST NOT SHOW UP?

37:18.937 --> 37:21.438
FUCK.

37:23.007 --> 37:24.608
WHAT?

37:24.609 --> 37:26.477
THERE WERE...

37:26.478 --> 37:26.643
ADDITIONAL FEES...
THIS WEEK.

37:30.281 --> 37:31.315
THE MONEY
CAME THROUGH YESTERDAY.

37:32.884 --> 37:35.319
- I GUESS SHE WAS WAITING...
- ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?

37:35.320 --> 37:37.754
...AND THE PASSPORT STORY
WAS THERE TO JUST
STRING US ALONG.

37:37.755 --> 37:39.456
MORE THAN THE 30?

37:40.825 --> 37:42.626
NOT AS MUCH--
ANOTHER 10.

37:50.702 --> 37:52.636
WE'RE NEVER
GONNA SEE HER AGAIN.

37:52.637 --> 37:55.372
MAYBE SHE WAS
NEVER OURS.

37:57.509 --> 38:00.010
- MAYBE NONE
OF THIS WAS REAL.
- IT WAS REAL.

38:00.011 --> 38:01.912
YOU FELT IT TOO,
DIDN'T YOU?

38:03.715 --> 38:06.383
YEAH, I THOUGHT I DID.

38:06.384 --> 38:09.052
BUT... IS SHE...

38:09.053 --> 38:10.387
DOES SHE EVEN
BELONG TO US, LEGALLY?

38:12.457 --> 38:14.625
IF THIS IS A SCAM,
IF THEY'RE CRIMINALS,

38:14.626 --> 38:17.728
- DO WE EVEN STICK AROUND?
- SHE'S A LITTLE GIRL.

38:17.729 --> 38:18.862
SHE'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE

38:20.398 --> 38:23.000
WITH GOD KNOWS
WHAT KINDS OF PEOPLE.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.535
SHE WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE OUR DAUGHTER.

38:24.536 --> 38:25.936
DOESN'T THAT MEAN
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TRY?

38:25.937 --> 38:28.839
OF COURSE IT DOES.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.575
YES.

38:31.576 --> 38:35.445
LET'S--
LET'S DRIVE AROUND SOME MORE.

38:35.446 --> 38:37.514
I JUST--
I NEED SOME TIME, OKAY?
YOU DRIVE AROUND.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.854
SHIT.

39:19.591 --> 39:22.626
- HEY, SHANNON.
- SHANNON?

39:22.627 --> 39:23.694
IT'S BENJAMIN
AND VERONICA.

39:26.564 --> 39:28.532
- I JUST WANTED TO SAY
WE'RE REALLY SORRY...
- I KNOW THAT.

39:28.533 --> 39:29.566
...FOR WHAT HAPPENED
THE OTHER NIGHT.

39:29.567 --> 39:32.436
IT WAS JUST
A MISUNDERSTANDING,

39:32.437 --> 39:33.804
I KNOW STEVEN DIDN'T
PICK A FIGHT WITH YOU.HE'S SO PASSIVE,
HE WOULDN'T HURT A FLY.

39:33.805 --> 39:35.572
HE DIDN'T PICK
A FIGHT WITH ME,

39:35.573 --> 39:36.974
IT WAS MY BUDDY SALO,
ANYWAY.

39:36.975 --> 39:38.575
WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW
THAT HE DIDN'T DRINK.

39:38.576 --> 39:41.044
LOOK, MY DAUGHTER'S MISSING,
SO I DON'T--

39:41.045 --> 39:43.146
CAN WE JUST NOT?

39:43.147 --> 39:45.082
YOU'RE DAUGHTER'S MISSING?
WHERE IS SHE?

39:45.083 --> 39:46.450
YEAH, IT'S ALL--
IT'S ALL PART OF SOME SCAM.

39:48.653 --> 39:50.554
A SCAM?

39:50.555 --> 39:52.656
YEAH, THESE PEOPLE,
THEY JUST-- THEY, UM...

39:52.657 --> 39:54.424
THEY GIVE YOU A LITTLE GIRL,

39:56.060 --> 39:58.929
THEY GET A 100 GRAND
FROM YOU...

39:58.930 --> 40:00.697
AND THEN THEY TAKE HER BACK.

40:03.735 --> 40:06.470
100 GRAND?
OH MY GOD.

40:06.471 --> 40:07.704
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?

40:11.609 --> 40:14.478
- DID YOU TALK TO THE POLICE?
- YEAH, I CALLED THE COPS.- WHAT DID THEY SAY?
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?
- WILL YOU EXCUSE ME?

40:44.442 --> 40:45.976
HOW DO YOU NOT TELL ME
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT BIG--

40:45.977 --> 40:47.744
<i>SHANNON, I KNEW
IF I TOLD YOU</i>

40:47.745 --> 40:49.179
ABOUT THE MONEY
YOU WOULD'VE JUST--

40:49.180 --> 40:50.180
IF YOU TOLD ME
ABOUT THE MONEY,

40:50.181 --> 40:52.449
I WOULD'VE SAID
IT WAS A BAD IDEA.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.951
YEAH, OKAY, WELL,
I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING
A GOOD DECISION FOR US.

40:54.952 --> 40:56.520
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
DOING SOMETHING GOOD.

40:56.521 --> 41:00.190
IT'S ABOUT YOUR
COMPLETE LACK OF JUDGMENT.

41:00.191 --> 41:01.958
THANKS.

41:01.959 --> 41:03.794
A MARRIAGE IS
A PARTNERSHIP, OKAY?

41:03.795 --> 41:05.696
YOU NEVER TALK TO ME!

41:05.697 --> 41:07.464
WE ARE STILL
GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS.

41:07.465 --> 41:08.598
I KNOW WHERE SHE IS.

41:10.601 --> 41:13.003
- I'M CALLING THE POLICE.
- WAIT.

41:13.004 --> 41:14.137
BENJAMIN HAS HER.

41:15.740 --> 41:17.808
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- I CAN TAKE YOU TO HER.

41:17.809 --> 41:18.975
WHY SHOULD WE TRUST YOU?

41:18.976 --> 41:20.777
WE DON'T HAVE
ANOTHER OPTION.

41:20.778 --> 41:22.212
IS SHE OKAY?

41:22.213 --> 41:24.614
SHE'S FINE.
SHE'S JUST SCARED.

41:24.615 --> 41:26.116
- WHY ARE YOU HELPING US?
- YEAH.

41:26.117 --> 41:28.085
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO BE A PART OF IT.

41:30.655 --> 41:33.156
SAY A FUCKING WORD
I'M GONNA BLOW YOUR
HEAD OFF, OKAY?

41:33.157 --> 41:35.192
- GO TO THE WALL.
PUT YOUR HANDS
UP ON THE WALL.

41:35.193 --> 41:36.760
<i>AGAINST THE WALL NOW!</i>

41:36.761 --> 41:37.828
HANDS DOWN.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.229
SHH. PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

41:41.666 --> 41:43.867
GET THE TAPE.

41:45.236 --> 41:46.870
<i>BE QUIET.</i>

41:46.871 --> 41:47.104
THANK YOU.
OKAY.

41:49.807 --> 41:51.775
ALL RIGHT,
STAY THERE. WALLET?

44:59.897 --> 45:02.132
ALL RIGHT, YOU DIDN'T WORK
AFTER THE ACCIDENT?

45:02.133 --> 45:03.867
I'M TELLING YOU, MAN,
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

45:06.070 --> 45:07.003
STEVEN...

45:08.906 --> 45:10.373
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE A SMART GUY.

45:10.374 --> 45:12.842
<i>I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU.</i>

45:12.843 --> 45:16.846

45:16.847 --> 45:18.882
YOU KNOW THIS WOMAN,
GABRIELLE REIGERT?

45:18.883 --> 45:19.849
THAT'S NOT HER REAL NAME.
HER REAL NAME IS ANGIE.

45:22.353 --> 45:24.087
SO THIS FUNNY, LITTLE WOMAN

45:24.088 --> 45:25.388

IN SOME SHIT-HOLE,

45:25.389 --> 45:26.990
BUSINESS-CLASS
AIRPORT LOUNGE

45:26.991 --> 45:29.492
AND SAYS,
"COME DO THIS THING."

45:33.898 --> 45:35.966
"WHO IS
THIS WOMAN?" I'M THINKING.
"WHAT IS SHE, FUCKING INTEL?

45:35.967 --> 45:37.901
WHAT IS SHE, BLACKWATER?
CHRISTIAN OUTREACH?"

45:37.902 --> 45:38.969
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK.

45:38.970 --> 45:40.737
SHE SAYS, "I PAY CASH.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.939
$25,000 A POP."

45:42.940 --> 45:44.975
SO TO BE FAIR TO YOU,

45:46.177 --> 45:47.911
IT'S NOT JUST YOU
AND YOUR BANK ACCOUNTS

45:47.912 --> 45:49.946
THAT I DON'T
ALTOGETHER TRUST.

45:49.947 --> 45:52.882
LIKE MAYBE SHE BURNED ME
A LITTLE BIT.

45:52.883 --> 45:56.753
AND AFTER YOUR WIFE AND I HAD
A LITTLE GET TOGETHER IN TOWN--

45:56.754 --> 45:58.388
NOTHING UNTOWARD, BROTHER,
NOTHING UNTOWARD--

45:58.389 --> 46:02.092
WELL, I DECIDED WE HAD
TO CHECK OUT A FEW THINGS.

46:02.093 --> 46:04.461
SEE, USUALLY WE JUST
TAKE THE KID

46:04.462 --> 46:06.529
AND YOU LEAVE THE ISLAND
BURNING IN SHAME.

46:06.530 --> 46:08.331
BUT NECESSITY BRINGS US
TOGETHER ONE MORE TIME.

46:12.069 --> 46:13.937
AND WHILE WE'RE HERE,
YOU KNOW,

46:13.938 --> 46:15.305
WE'RE GONNA DO
THIS OTHER THING

46:15.306 --> 46:18.942
BECAUSE THIS IS, AFTER ALL,
WHAT WE DO FOR A LIVING.

46:18.943 --> 46:20.377
- YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.

46:20.378 --> 46:21.945
I DON'T THINK
I AM, STEVEN.

46:21.946 --> 46:22.445
OKAY, WE WANT TO DO
BANK OF AMERICA OR CITIBANK?

46:25.783 --> 46:26.783
BANK OF AMERICA?

46:30.921 --> 46:33.189
OKAY, STEVEN,
NOW WE NEED THE PASSCODE,

46:33.190 --> 46:36.059
SO IT'LL ALL GO A LOT EASIER
IF YOU JUST GIVE IT TO ME.

46:36.060 --> 46:39.295
I'M TELLING YOU, YOU ARE
WASTING YOUR FUCKING TIME.

46:39.297 --> 46:41.498
ALL RIGHT, NOW I THINK
YOU'RE LYING TO ME.

46:41.499 --> 46:43.300
AND I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
THE ONLY ONE WHO'S LYING TO ME.

46:43.301 --> 46:45.201
BUT I'M TELLING YOU SOMETHING,
I'M SICK OF BEING LIED TO.

46:45.202 --> 46:47.270
SO LET'S BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT
WHAT THE STAKES ARE.

46:49.006 --> 46:51.041
THOSE ARE THE STAKES!

46:51.042 --> 46:53.143
- WE'LL BLOW HER
FUCKING BRAINS OUT!

46:55.813 --> 46:59.082

46:59.083 --> 47:02.018

47:17.001 --> 47:18.368

- LET GO OF HER.

47:18.369 --> 47:19.969
- LET GO OF HER.
- LET HER GO!

47:19.970 --> 47:21.571

47:23.240 --> 47:25.475
HEY, CALM DOWN.

47:25.476 --> 47:29.212
EVERYBODY TAKE
A DEEP BREATH, OKAY?

48:26.070 --> 48:28.671
BABY, I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
SO DRUNK THAT NIGHT.

48:32.643 --> 48:36.279
IF I WASN'T AND YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO COME GET ME,

48:36.280 --> 48:38.214
NONE OF THIS
WOULD HAVE EVER HAPPENED.

48:38.215 --> 48:40.350
WE WOULDN'T BE HERE.

48:51.228 --> 48:53.062
I KNOW I CAN'T
CHANGE THE PAST.

48:53.063 --> 48:57.066
- GOD KNOWS I WISH I COULD.
- BABY, THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

48:57.067 --> 48:58.001
BUT I CAN GET US OUT OF THIS,
I PROMISE YOU.

48:59.503 --> 49:02.105
<i>I PROMISE.</i>

49:17.254 --> 49:17.520
GOOD MORNING.

49:19.323 --> 49:22.292

49:30.167 --> 49:32.969

<i>SO TODAY IS GONNA BE
KIND OF A LAY-AROUND DAY,</i>

49:39.243 --> 49:40.710
<i>YOU KNOW, NOTHING TO DO.</i>

49:40.711 --> 49:42.478
LOOK, I'M NOT
A MONSTER OR ANYTHING,

49:42.480 --> 49:44.480
AND I'LL BRING YOU

49:44.482 --> 49:46.516
<i>AND MAYBE YOU CAN EVEN

I'M SORRY.
WHAT WAS THAT?

49:49.587 --> 49:51.754

49:59.630 --> 50:01.231
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK
ABOUT THE KID.

50:01.232 --> 50:04.167
IF THINGS GO SMOOTH,
THE KID'S YOURS.

50:04.168 --> 50:05.535
HOW DO WE KNOW SHE'S ALIVE?

50:05.536 --> 50:06.636
WELL, THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION.

50:08.706 --> 50:10.673
<i>LET ME GET BACK

50:31.595 --> 50:33.229
SHANNON, WE ARE
GETTING OUT OF THIS.

50:36.200 --> 50:38.334
YOU GO INTO THE BANK.

50:38.335 --> 50:40.136
YOU HAVE TO
TELL THEM EVERYTHING.

50:40.137 --> 50:41.704
NO, BABY, NO.

50:41.705 --> 50:43.306
NO, WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM
WHAT THEY WANT.

50:43.307 --> 50:45.308
IT'S ONLY MONEY.
THEY'RE AFTER THE MONEY.

READY FOR BED?

52:09.426 --> 52:11.427
MM-HMM.

52:11.428 --> 52:12.695

<i>- Well, just a little.</i>

52:48.666 --> 52:51.668
IT'S STILL WORTH IT.
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO SQUEEZE

52:51.669 --> 52:54.604
A LITTLE BIT MORE OUT OF THEM.
SO, I'LL SEE YOU

52:54.605 --> 52:57.640
<i>in a few days

54:00.904 --> 54:03.439
IT'S A BIG DAY.

54:04.541 --> 54:06.375
WE'RE GONNA GO
TO THE BANK.

54:06.376 --> 54:07.977
WE'LL GET YOU THE MONEY.

54:07.978 --> 54:08.945
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA COOPERATE

54:09.980 --> 54:11.614

GET YOU THE MONEY...

54:11.615 --> 54:13.516
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA
FORGET ALL ABOUT YOU.

54:13.517 --> 54:16.486
MM-HMM.
MM-HMM.

54:16.487 --> 54:18.421
PLEASE, JUST TAKE THE MONEY

<i>THEN YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.</i>

55:05.469 --> 55:07.503
<i>HE'S GONNA BE FOLLOWING YOU,
BUT NOT LIKE HE KNOWS YOU.</i>

55:09.907 --> 55:13.442
<i>IF YOU DO ANYTHING
OR IF YOU TIP ANYBODY OFF,</i>

55:13.443 --> 55:16.479
<i>LAST THING HE DOES
BEFORE HE LEAVES THE BANK,</i>

55:16.480 --> 55:18.748
<i>IS SHOOT YOU.</i>

55:18.749 --> 55:21.384
IF HE SHOOTS YOU, THAT MEANS
WE'RE NOT GETTING OUR MONEY,

55:21.385 --> 55:23.686
WHICH BASICALLY MEANS,
WE'RE SHOOTING YOU IN ANGER.

55:23.687 --> 55:25.354
IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING,

55:25.355 --> 55:26.489
WE DON'T WANT TO SHOOT YOU
OR YOUR WIFE.

55:27.758 --> 55:30.893
SO THAT'S IT,
THAT'S THE PLAY.
