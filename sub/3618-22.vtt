HA HA HA HA.
NOW THIS IS FUN.

21:17.493 --> 21:19.974

WE STILL NEED HIM
FOR LEVERAGE.

21:20.148 --> 21:22.281

TO US DEAD.
NOT YET, ANYWAY.

21:30.158 --> 21:32.987
SEE? THIS IS
THE CRAZY-ASS
KIND OF STUFF

21:33.161 --> 21:35.076
THAT MAKES ME
NOT WANNA HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH YOU PEOPLE.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.469
WHO ARE YOU
TALKING TO?

21:36.643 --> 21:37.818
Phoebe: US.

21:37.992 --> 21:39.559
UH!

21:39.733 --> 21:41.648
THAT'S NOT
GONNA STOP US.

21:41.822 --> 21:44.215

THIS WILL.

21:44.390 --> 21:47.218
[SIGHS]

21:47.393 --> 21:48.698

21:50.439 --> 21:52.920
NICE FIREPOWER, LEO.
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD IT IN YOU.

21:53.094 --> 21:55.401
DON'T GO
ANYWHERE.

21:57.446 --> 21:58.491
STAY AWAY FROM ME.

21:58.665 --> 21:59.492

TAKE YOU TO GIDEON.

21:59.666 --> 22:00.493
HE CAN HEAL YOU.

22:00.667 --> 22:01.755
NO! STAY AWAY!

22:01.929 --> 22:03.017
DARRYL, PLEASE.

22:03.191 --> 22:04.845
I SAID NO, DAMN IT!
LEAVE ME ALONE.

22:05.019 --> 22:06.890
I DON'T WANNA
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH YOU PEOPLE ANYMORE.

22:07.064 --> 22:09.110
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

22:09.284 --> 22:12.679
WELL, I DON'T THINK THAT
HELPED OUR CAUSE ANY.

22:16.465 --> 22:18.598

WILL BE JOINING YOU SOON.

22:18.772 --> 22:20.164
ARE YOU CERTAIN
YOU CAN KEEP...

22:20.339 --> 22:23.124
MINE AWAY?
ABSOLUTELY.

22:23.298 --> 22:25.300
I TOLD THEM
TO WAIT AT THE MANOR

22:25.474 --> 22:28.085
FOR THE GOOD
LEO AND CHRIS
TO COME TO THEM.

22:30.261 --> 22:31.393
I'M TAKING
YOUR KNIGHT.

22:36.006 --> 22:37.660
I KNEW YOU'D DO THAT.

22:40.402 --> 22:42.491
SO THE NEXT MOVE,
OF COURSE, IS...

22:42.665 --> 22:43.666

22:43.840 --> 22:45.668
ONCE SHE'S IN LABOR,

22:45.842 --> 22:47.453
WE'LL HAVE A CLEAR
SHOT AT THE BOY.

22:47.627 --> 22:49.324
IF WE IMPRESS UPON HER
THE EXTENT OF THE DANGER

22:49.498 --> 22:50.760
HER SISTERS ARE IN...

22:50.934 --> 22:53.023
IT WILL
EXPEDITE MATTERS.

22:53.197 --> 22:54.547
BUT EVERYTHING
HAS TO HAPPEN QUICKLY.

22:54.721 --> 22:56.462
WE'RE TINKERING HERE
WITH THE GRAND DESIGN,

22:56.636 --> 22:58.507
RISKING
ITS TENUOUS STABILITY...

22:58.681 --> 23:02.511
BY CREATING AN IMBALANCE
OF POWER ON ONE SIDE.
I KNOW.

23:02.685 --> 23:04.252
BUT IT'S
A FAR GREATER RISK

23:04.426 --> 23:06.297
TO ALLOW WYATT
TO GROW UP.

23:06.472 --> 23:08.474
TO THREATEN BOTH WORLDS.

23:08.648 --> 23:09.779
I AGREE.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.224
I LIKE THE WAY
YOU THINK.

23:21.574 --> 23:23.184
Phoebe: GIDEON?

23:24.664 --> 23:25.839
NO ECHO.

23:26.013 --> 23:27.754
A GOOD SIGN.

23:30.104 --> 23:31.975
THEY CAN NEVER KNOW
WE WERE BEHIND THIS.

23:32.149 --> 23:34.935
THEY WON'T.

23:40.984 --> 23:41.985
DID YOU CATCH THEM?

23:42.159 --> 23:43.509
YEAH, STUCK 'EM
IN A CLASSROOM,

23:43.683 --> 23:45.554
AND, YOU KNOW,
THEY CAN'T ORB
OUT OF THERE.

23:45.728 --> 23:47.991
THEY ARE
A LITTLE FEISTIER THAN
THE REAL CHRIS AND LEO.

23:48.165 --> 23:49.950
I DON'T KNOW
HOW WE'RE GOING TO
GET THEM TO COOPERATE.

23:50.124 --> 23:52.648
HMM. WELL,
I'M SURE YOUR
EVIL COUNTERPARTS

23:52.822 --> 23:54.345
ARE ANTICIPATING
EXACTLY
THE SAME PROBLEMS

23:54.520 --> 23:56.130
SINCE, OTHER
THAN MORALITY,

23:56.304 --> 23:57.305
YOU'RE ONE
AND THE SAME.

23:57.479 --> 23:58.654
HOW DOES
THAT HELP US

23:58.828 --> 24:00.221
FIGURE OUT
WHAT WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

24:02.310 --> 24:04.094
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD
TRADE YOURSELVES.

24:04.268 --> 24:06.575
YOU GO INTO THEIR WORLD,
THEY'LL COME INTO OURS.

24:06.749 --> 24:09.404
YOU CAN EACH RETRIEVE
YOUR RESPECTIVE
LEO AND CHRIS.

24:10.536 --> 24:12.102
KIND OF MAKES SENSE.

24:12.276 --> 24:14.757
AND WHAT ABOUT
YOUR EVIL COUNTERPART?

24:14.931 --> 24:16.542
WILL HE BE HIP
TO THIS PLAN?

24:16.716 --> 24:18.326

EVERY CONFIDENCE

24:18.500 --> 24:19.806

BE WAITING THERE

AS I AM HERE.

24:21.547 --> 24:24.506

24:24.680 --> 24:26.334
WE'RE ALL AFTER
THE SAME THING--

24:26.508 --> 24:28.336
LEO AND
CHRIS RETURNED

24:28.510 --> 24:30.947
AND THE COSMIC
BALANCE RESTORED.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.431
WE'RE GONNA NEED
THE POWER OF THREE.

24:53.927 --> 24:56.059
OK, WHERE
IS EVERYBODY?

24:56.233 --> 24:59.323
ISN'T PIPER
SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE?

24:59.498 --> 25:02.152
THIS IS WEIRD.
I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD BE HERE.

25:02.326 --> 25:04.503
WE SHOULD
GET OUT OF HERE.

25:05.721 --> 25:07.244
AAH!

25:09.377 --> 25:10.770
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

25:10.944 --> 25:13.990

SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

25:19.474 --> 25:21.607

THEY COME THROUGH?
WHERE ARE THEY?

25:21.781 --> 25:23.130
I DON'T KNOW.

25:24.435 --> 25:26.089

NOW, WOULD WE?

25:43.890 --> 25:46.022
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

25:46.196 --> 25:48.503
JUST BY COMING HERE,
YOU MAY HAVE THROWN
BOTH WORLDS

25:48.677 --> 25:51.637
IRREVERSIBLY
OUT OF BALANCE.

THAT, TOO?

25:54.727 --> 25:55.858
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

25:56.032 --> 25:58.165
IF I WANTED TO KILL YOU,
I WOULD HAVE.

25:58.339 --> 26:01.690
I WAS JUST...
CAUGHT OFF GUARD.

26:01.864 --> 26:04.650
WELL, YOU NEED
TO RELAX THERE, TIGER.

26:04.824 --> 26:08.523

WORLD HERE...PHOEBES.

26:11.657 --> 26:14.355

ARE YOUR PAIGE AND PHOEBE?

26:17.619 --> 26:20.361
OUT LOOKING
FOR YOUR LEO AND CHRIS.

26:20.535 --> 26:22.363

TO BRING THEM BACK HERE.

26:22.537 --> 26:24.191
WELL,
YOUR LEO AND CHRIS

26:24.365 --> 26:27.194
ARE AT OUR MAGIC SCHOOL
WAITING TO BE RESCUED.

26:27.368 --> 26:29.022

26:29.196 --> 26:32.199
OK, THIS IS
JUST ONE BIG MESS.

26:32.373 --> 26:34.636
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE WHOLE
YIN-YANG BUSINESS?

26:34.810 --> 26:36.420
OBVIOUSLY,
IT'S BEEN THROWN OFF,

26:36.595 --> 26:40.163
POSSIBLY AS A RESULT
OF THE EXCHANGE
OF LEO AND CHRIS.

26:40.337 --> 26:42.035

26:42.209 --> 26:45.604

WHEN THEY'RE IN BALANCE.

26:45.778 --> 26:48.084
AND THEY NO LONGER ARE.

26:48.258 --> 26:49.869
OK. IF
IT'S ALREADY BAD,

26:50.043 --> 26:52.262
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
NOW THAT WE'RE HERE?

26:52.436 --> 26:54.569
WITH BOTH SETS OF SISTERS
ON THE SAME SIDE,

26:54.743 --> 26:56.745
THE BALANCE
IS DANGEROUSLY AT RISK.

26:56.919 --> 26:59.356
WE HAVE TO WORK QUICKLY
TO CORRECT IT.

IF YOU ARE SUGGESTING
A PLAN, DON'T.

27:03.534 --> 27:05.058

YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

27:05.232 --> 27:06.755

HIS PIPER.

27:06.929 --> 27:09.192
IF YOU DO,
SHE'LL PROBABLY KILL YOU.

27:09.366 --> 27:11.891
SHE'S EVIL, REMEMBER,
AND SHE'S GOT
A TERRIBLE TEMPER.

27:12.065 --> 27:14.763

27:14.937 --> 27:16.983

NOT MUCH DIFFERENT
IN OUR WORLD.

27:17.157 --> 27:17.940

WE CAN HANDLE IT.

DIDN'T UPHOLD THEIR

FIND OUR GUYS.

YOU KNOW THEM...
KNOW HOW THEY THINK.

27:42.399 --> 27:46.055
OK, SO WE'RE
GONNA BRING YOU

27:46.229 --> 27:47.796
AND THEN WHAT?

YOU'LL HAVE OUR PIPER
FOR A POWER-OF-THREE SPELL.

SHE'LL KNOW
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO GET HER MEN BACK.

27:53.802 --> 27:56.109
AND IF YOU ENCOUNTER
YOUR COUNTERPARTS,
BE CAREFUL.
