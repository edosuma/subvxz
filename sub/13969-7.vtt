BEING DRUGGED AND RAPED

20:33.623 --> 20:38.280
ARE VERY SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS,

20:38.280 --> 20:40.717
DID YOU FILE A CRIMINAL
COMPLAINT WITH THE POLICE?

20:40.717 --> 20:42.893
NO.

20:42.893 --> 20:44.591
WHY NOT?

20:46.767 --> 20:51.293

AND HUMILIATED.

I'M THE SINGLE MOTHER
OF A 4-YEAR-OLD SON,

20:53.295 --> 20:55.471

WANT TO DEAL WITH IT.

20:55.471 --> 20:57.212
MS. HARKINS,
WHAT WAS YOUR SALARY

20:57.212 --> 20:58.866
WHEN YOU WORKED
FOR MR. BLUNT?

20:58.866 --> 21:02.783
AROUND $60,000 A YEAR.

21:02.783 --> 21:05.307
AND IN 2009,
MR. BLUNT WAS IN NEGOTIATIONS

21:05.307 --> 21:08.354
TO SELL HIS COMPANY TO APPLE.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

21:08.354 --> 21:10.356
THAT WAS THE RUMOR
AT THE TIME.

21:10.356 --> 21:13.228
DID YOU HAVE STOCK OPTIONS
IN MR. BLUNT'S COMPANY?

21:13.228 --> 21:14.577
NO.

21:14.577 --> 21:16.579

21:16.579 --> 21:18.277

YOU MIGHT WELL HAVE
LOST YOUR JOB

AND YOUR LIVELIHOOD,

THAT YOU ENGAGED IN A CONSENSUAL

A HUGE PAYDAY FOR YOURSELF?

22:20.121 --> 22:22.776

THE MURDER OF KEVIN NEYERS,
MR. BLUNT'S BIOLOGICAL FATHER.

24:57.365 --> 24:59.846

24:59.846 --> 25:01.369
AND, UH,
IN SUBSEQUENT INTERVIEWS,

25:01.369 --> 25:03.676
HE LIED ABOUT
BEING WITH CINDY

25:03.676 --> 25:05.721
AT HER HOUSE
THE NIGHT SHE DIED,

25:05.721 --> 25:09.029
AND HE ALSO LIED ABOUT
HAVING SEX WITH HER

25:09.029 --> 25:10.857
THE NIGHT OF HER DEATH.

25:10.857 --> 25:14.338
IS IT TRUE THAT AFTER
YOU INTERVIEWED THE DEFENDANT

25:14.338 --> 25:16.819
ABOUT CINDY STRAUSS' DEATH,

25:16.819 --> 25:18.647

ON A DATE?

25:18.647 --> 25:22.172
YES,

25:22.172 --> 25:24.000

25:24.000 --> 25:25.741
IN ORDER TO LINK HIM
TO CINDY'S DEATH,

25:25.741 --> 25:30.224
SO I USED THE PRETENSE OF A DATE
TO OBTAIN HIS DNA SAMPLE.

25:30.224 --> 25:32.182
HMM.
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

25:32.182 --> 25:33.314

AS A MEDIUM TO SAMPLE THE DNA.

27:02.969 --> 27:06.320
WHY WERE YOU ON

27:06.320 --> 27:09.845

HAD CAUSE TO SHOOT AN ASSAILANT.

27:23.859 --> 27:25.513

WITH A KITCHEN KNIFE,

27:25.513 --> 27:28.168

IN THE ROOM WITH ME.

THE YOUNG BOY WHO'S MOTHER
WAS BEING BRUTALLY ASSAULTED,

FOR ME TO SIT BACK
AND DO NOTHING

FOR WRONGFUL DEATH.

28:06.380 --> 28:09.209

28:09.209 --> 28:11.211
INTO GIVING UP

28:11.211 --> 28:13.561

COMPLETELY OUT OF POLICY

28:17.957 --> 28:22.788

THESE BEHAVIORS

28:25.312 --> 28:28.228
CALL INTO QUESTION YOUR
COMPETENCE AS A POLICE OFFICER?

28:28.228 --> 28:30.621
NO, I DON'T.

28:30.621 --> 28:34.147
TWO LIVES WERE AT RISK.
I COULDN'T WAIT FOR BACKUP.

28:34.147 --> 28:37.454
AND AS FAR AS ME GOING ON A
SO-CALLED DATE WITH ERICH BLUNT,

28:37.454 --> 28:39.935
THERE WAS NO OTHER MEANS
BY WHICH TO OBTAIN HIS DNA,

POOR JUDGMENT.
