any more problems.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.960
is also your girl's baby daddy,

15:05.040 --> 15:07.077
which kind of begs the question--

15:07.160 --> 15:08.355
do you ever wonder

15:08.440 --> 15:10.317
what the hell was going on in there

15:10.400 --> 15:12.038
when she has her "appointments"?

15:13.880 --> 15:15.837
You could try to be
a little less predictable.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.479
Ahh.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.238
That hurts, Gabe, truly.

15:19.320 --> 15:21.357
You know, we're all grown-ups here.

and mutual respect we have.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.638
What singed your nostrils earlier

16:32.760 --> 16:35.434
was no doubt a toxic mixture
of creosote and H20.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.159
Blizzard's done
some tearing and blaring.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.560
And our chimney's ventilation
capabilities

16:43.640 --> 16:44.869
are nil to none.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.076
It'd be unwise
to spark up another blaze

16:47.160 --> 16:49.549
lest we plan on ceasing
all respiratory functions,

17:07.200 --> 17:08.598
You know, without a fire,

17:08.680 --> 17:10.671
we'll never get these people
warm enough.

17:10.760 --> 17:11.875
[Sighs]

17:11.960 --> 17:13.233
Yeah, we should leave

17:13.319 --> 17:14.390
before the temperature
drops any lower.

17:14.480 --> 17:18.916
Okay, folks, contingency plan.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.674
We're going to Aaron's house.

17:21.760 --> 17:25.515
It'll be tight quarters,
but we'll make it work.

17:33.680 --> 17:34.909
Seriously?

17:37.120 --> 17:40.317
Not one of you assholes
is gonna untie me?

17:40.400 --> 17:43.916
We could tell Michonne
it was an accident.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.434
All right?

18:53.520 --> 18:54.510
We Will.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.511
Yeah.

19:00.360 --> 19:03.193
Something happened back there
with you and Ezekiel?

19:03.280 --> 19:04.839
No.

19:12.280 --> 19:13.509
He only blames you

19:13.600 --> 19:16.240
because he can't let himself
blame me.

19:24.120 --> 19:26.430
I feel like I'm losing myself again.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.240
[Voice breaking]
I'm really trying to hang on,

19:33.320 --> 19:35.789
but I don't...

19:35.880 --> 19:37.439
I don't know what I'm doing.

19:41.320 --> 19:42.799
[Exhales sharply]

19:48.320 --> 19:51.278
I could take her away from here.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.431
I can keep her safe on my own.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.873
You want to go?

19:58.120 --> 19:59.838
No.

20:02.640 --> 20:06.599
No, I don't.

20:06.680 --> 20:08.910
What do you want me to do?

20:18.160 --> 20:20.549
The snow's never hit this hard
this early.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.029
Yeah.

20:23.120 --> 20:25.839
It could last for days, but we can't.

20:25.920 --> 20:26.910
Not here.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.832
We don't have enough.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.354
Maybe if I head to the way station,

20:30.440 --> 20:31.350
bring back supplies.

20:31.440 --> 20:33.636
Yeah, I thought of that, too.

20:33.720 --> 20:35.438
But we might get
caught out there in this

20:35.520 --> 20:37.511
and leave them worse off.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.831
Let me see your map.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.479
The next way station is here,

20:42.560 --> 20:43.834
right across the river

20:43.920 --> 20:45.558
that runs alongside the old route B.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.398
I thought the only crossing

20:47.480 --> 20:48.879
-was back along the route we were on.
- Aaron: It is.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.109
There's no way we'll make it,

20:50.200 --> 20:52.555
not in these conditions.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.074
Rick's bridge would've saved us.

20:54.160 --> 20:55.753
It could've cut half a day
off our travel time.

20:55.840 --> 20:58.434
But we don't need a bridge.

20:58.520 --> 21:00.238
The creeks and ponds
are frozen over.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.397
As long as we don't all go at once,

21:02.480 --> 21:04.437
we could probably just walk across.

21:04.520 --> 21:07.160
There, through our old hunting grounds.

21:07.240 --> 21:08.560
It's a straight shot.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.472
A straight shot through
Alpha's territory.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.351
We didn't agree to those borders.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.795
Those borders are hers, not ours.

21:16.920 --> 21:19.719
That's cold comfort
if we trigger a war.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.319
We don't even know
how to fight them yet.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.073
It's only a couple miles--

21:23.160 --> 21:24.389
Hey, we can cross at night.

21:24.480 --> 21:25.914
They won't know that we're there.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.798
What if they already know?

21:27.880 --> 21:29.553
They could've been watching us
in that field back there.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.557
It's all the more reason to move now.

21:33.440 --> 21:34.555
Aaron: We can do this.

21:34.640 --> 21:35.596
Ezekiel: With the elderly?

21:35.680 --> 21:37.591
With the children?

21:37.680 --> 21:40.035
We can't take horses and wagons
across the ice.

21:40.120 --> 21:41.155
Then we'll have to go by foot.

21:41.240 --> 21:43.834
Yes, it's risky,

21:43.920 --> 21:45.797
but we're only carrying enough food

21:45.880 --> 21:47.553
to last us another day or two,

21:47.640 --> 21:49.551
and this storm could dump enough snow

21:49.640 --> 21:52.109
to make these roads
impassable for weeks.

21:52.200 --> 21:54.476
It's either we make it
to the next way station

21:54.560 --> 21:55.914
or we die.

22:14.440 --> 22:19.640
[Sighs]

22:19.720 --> 22:21.552
I'm sorry.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.837
I wish there was another way.

22:24.920 --> 22:29.756
I just want to do right by them.

22:29.840 --> 22:33.629
The Kingdom fell.

22:33.720 --> 22:37.873
I should've seen it coming,
gotten us out sooner.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.320
My people wouldn't be here like this

22:39.400 --> 22:40.674
if it wasn't for me.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.513
No, they wouldn't be.

22:43.600 --> 22:46.956
'Cause they wouldn't be here at all.

22:50.360 --> 22:55.389
All this time we spent apart...

22:55.480 --> 22:59.110
I thought it made us stronger.

22:59.200 --> 23:02.192
It didn't.

23:02.280 --> 23:06.239
That...woman...

23:06.360 --> 23:07.873
was able to walk amongst us

23:07.960 --> 23:10.998
because we didn't know each other.

23:11.080 --> 23:14.550
[Sighs]

23:14.640 --> 23:17.109
We can never let that happen again.

23:21.960 --> 23:25.510
And we've come too far to give up.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.910
The Kingdom hasn't fallen.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.877
It's right here.

23:29.960 --> 23:34.636
And that charter we signed,
it means something.

23:34.720 --> 23:36.552
It means that these people
aren't just yours anymore.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.790
They're ours.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.359
And we're gonna get them home.

23:40.480 --> 23:42.471
If they see us crossing that border,

23:42.560 --> 23:43.880
it could start something.

23:45.840 --> 23:48.753
So we make sure that they don't.

27:52.760 --> 27:54.159
Yeah, I think we're good.

28:06.800 --> 28:08.598
We have to assume they have eyes
on the borders.

28:08.680 --> 28:11.479

are ready to go.

what's on the other side.

41:33.080 --> 41:34.957
Get better.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.678
You know, Dr. Babydaddy said

41:36.760 --> 41:38.671
that you got caught in the storm

41:38.760 --> 41:41.798
with the Royalty Brigade.

41:41.880 --> 41:43.598
Is everyone okay?

41:49.120 --> 41:50.633
Do you care?

41:52.240 --> 41:56.837
Look, I don't know
any of those people from Adam.

41:56.920 --> 41:59.309
I do know what it's like
to lose a kingdom,

41:59.400 --> 42:01.914
see things fall apart.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.957
And it sucks ass.

42:04.080 --> 42:07.914
The Sanctuary's a shithole now.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.514
Well, hell, I could've told you that.

42:10.600 --> 42:12.318
All you had to do was ask.

42:14.840 --> 42:19.152
So, you cut through their territory.

42:19.240 --> 42:21.470
Ballsy.

42:24.440 --> 42:27.990
[Chair moving, creaks]

42:31.000 --> 42:32.752
[Sighs]

42:32.840 --> 42:36.071
We don't even know
if they were there.

42:36.160 --> 42:38.913
The point is, we came together,

42:39.000 --> 42:42.914
and we made it.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.469
Common enemy, common goal.

42:45.560 --> 42:49.440
Or facing evil brings
good people together.

42:49.520 --> 42:52.558
Same thing.

42:52.640 --> 42:55.200
It's just that no one ever thinks

42:55.280 --> 42:57.954
that they're the evil one.

43:19.040 --> 43:23.796
The time away
has been good for the pack.

43:23.880 --> 43:25.837
And for you.

43:31.040 --> 43:32.314
Alpha: It has.

43:34.960 --> 43:37.190
But I've made mistakes--

43:37.280 --> 43:39.954
mistakes I can't make again.

43:40.040 --> 43:42.680
And you won't.

43:42.760 --> 43:44.034
You're strong.

43:47.200 --> 43:50.397
I'll need to be stronger
for what comes next.

43:53.440 --> 43:55.909
You will be.

44:08.280 --> 44:13.798
[Branch whips]

44:27.600 --> 44:30.831
We'll come back from this.

44:30.920 --> 44:33.673
Being here at Hilltop,

44:33.760 --> 44:38.357
amongst our family's a start.

44:38.440 --> 44:41.353
We'll make it through
this winter of our discontent.

44:41.440 --> 44:46.196
When the snow melts
and the winds quiet,

44:46.280 --> 44:48.510
who knows what glorious summer may bring.

44:50.120 --> 44:56.116
Maybe you can even go back home
to the Kingdom someday.

44:56.200 --> 44:57.474
<i>Just because we left our house</i>

44:57.560 --> 45:00.951
<i>doesn't mean we lost our home.</i>

45:01.040 --> 45:02.155
Roger that.

45:02.240 --> 45:04.834
<i>I have to go do my homework now.</i>

45:04.920 --> 45:06.831
<i>I'll tell my mom you said hello.</i>

45:06.920 --> 45:09.480
<i>Over and out.</i>

45:09.600 --> 45:10.954
Over and out.

45:23.320 --> 45:27.314
[Door opens, closes]

45:33.160 --> 45:34.559
[Static]

45:34.640 --> 45:38.315
<i>Woman: [Garbled] Hello? Hello?</i>

45:38.400 --> 45:41.233
<i>Calling out live on the open air.</i>

45:41.320 --> 45:43.152
<i>ls anybody out there?</i>
