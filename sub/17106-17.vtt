00:01.216 --> 00:02.695
Previously on Dance Academy...

00:03.212 --> 00:04.476
Our problem is with your kind.

00:04.511 --> 00:07.419
You're a second-year
in a first-year leotard

00:07.435 --> 00:09.419
and we don't like the second-years.

00:09.439 --> 00:12.419
Even if there was a moment,
we've probably missed it,

00:12.435 --> 00:13.479
so there's no point in...

00:13.499 --> 00:18.479
You're not OK with Kat and Christian.
You're still angry.

00:18.495 --> 00:20.499
Since when had being gay defined me?

00:21.507 --> 00:26.435
I kind of lied before.
I do like the neurotic ones.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074

01:50.567 --> 01:52.540
Go, go, go!

02:08.471 --> 02:11.480
What is going on out here?!

02:22.496 --> 02:27.463
None of you are going to sleep
until your side is spotless.

02:27.482 --> 02:30.388
But the first-years ambushed us!
No excuses!

02:30.408 --> 02:33.443
And you two, don't even pretend
that you've been fishing.

02:33.458 --> 02:35.392
Oh, um...

02:35.407 --> 02:37.433
In that case, you have broken curfew.

02:37.449 --> 02:39.446
Put that down, pick up a mop!

02:42.396 --> 02:44.349
Another strike?

02:44.370 --> 02:46.371
There'll be more.
We're one step ahead.

02:46.386 --> 02:48.328
Particularly concerning ballet.

02:48.344 --> 02:49.404
We would thrash you any day.

02:51.322 --> 02:52.394
Are you threatening a ballet battle?

02:53.311 --> 02:55.313
There's no such thing.
A hip-hop war.

02:55.333 --> 02:57.374
Second-year crew versus
the ballet tragics.

03:01.336 --> 03:05.299
Saturday afternoon,
12:45 at the cafe.

03:05.315 --> 03:07.340
We're done here. Let's bounce.

03:15.265 --> 03:18.235
They're well oiled,
I'll give them that much.

03:23.226 --> 03:27.193
Oh, sorry. How is it possible you
slept through that?

03:28.257 --> 03:31.207
Let me guess - Christian?

03:31.228 --> 03:35.186
'Cause you're not going to see him
for, like, a whole six hours.

03:35.206 --> 03:38.192
Ha-ha.
Look at you. You're addicted.

03:38.208 --> 03:40.217
I'm NOT addicted.

03:40.233 --> 03:42.218
Your pupils are permanently dilated.

03:42.234 --> 03:44.204
You made him your phone wallpaper.

03:44.223 --> 03:48.134
Coming from the girl who
spoons her Pilates mat.

03:48.155 --> 03:51.192
Admitting you have a problem is
the first step to recovery, Kat.

03:58.137 --> 04:01.118
Tara, I was extremely disappointed

04:01.139 --> 04:03.164
that you were involved
in last night's idiocy.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.125
I had no option.

04:05.145 --> 04:09.072
To be distracted when your recovery
has put you so far behind.

04:09.088 --> 04:11.058
Get your priorities in order.

04:12.125 --> 04:15.031
Are you just gonna take that?

04:16.031 --> 04:18.034
What happened to finding
your inner anger?

04:18.053 --> 04:22.079
Miss Raine's right - I need to put
my head down, work harder.

04:22.096 --> 04:24.042
Are you thick, woman?

04:24.057 --> 04:26.027
You exposed an abusive teacher

04:26.047 --> 04:28.996
and your dad is close
to suing the academy.

04:29.016 --> 04:32.058
If that's not a get-out-of-jail-free
card, I don't know what is.

04:41.020 --> 04:45.975
So... so we're not one of
those vomit-inducing couples,

04:45.995 --> 04:50.974
I was thinking we should introduce
some guidelines for behaviour.

04:50.994 --> 04:52.940
Guidelines?
It could be fun.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.958
Just on obvious stuff,
like a limit on PDAs,

04:55.978 --> 05:00.889
and no holding hands. We're both
capable of walking unaccompanied.

05:00.908 --> 05:02.934
I'll give you two hours
before you crack.

05:02.950 --> 05:04.952
You're not that irresistible.

05:08.914 --> 05:11.860
Comrades, let us rally together.

05:11.880 --> 05:14.901
Mandatory hip-hop training session,
wharf-side, lunch.

05:14.918 --> 05:17.863
Since you're all so keen on warring,

05:17.884 --> 05:20.881
we're doing Spartacus today
in repertoire.

05:20.901 --> 05:23.867
Except you, Tara. I want
a slow, technical barre.

05:24.880 --> 05:28.838
Et one, et two, et three,

05:28.855 --> 05:32.854
et one, et two, et three,

05:33.770 --> 05:36.788
et one...
Are you gonna be on our side?

05:36.808 --> 05:39.794
Pointless question. She
wouldn't dare betray her boyfriend.

05:39.813 --> 05:44.749
I... I'm sorry, but do you
see him attached to this hip?

05:44.765 --> 05:47.735
I could cross lines if I wanted to.

05:47.751 --> 05:49.796
And I'm exceptional at hip-hop.

05:50.713 --> 05:53.694
I might be the best chance
you guys have.

05:59.674 --> 06:03.677
Keep your swords strong - they need
to be an extension of your line.

06:16.674 --> 06:20.695
Was that meant to be a protest, Tara?
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

06:21.613 --> 06:24.595
I'll get maintenance. Everyone else,
keep working till I return.

06:30.622 --> 06:34.597
Can you trust me when I say
it's time to get less serious?

06:34.613 --> 06:35.641
You deserve some fun.

06:38.544 --> 06:41.537
At risk of further
inflating your ego,

06:41.554 --> 06:43.583
you're the best hip-hop dancer here.

06:43.598 --> 06:45.532
No offence, Christian.

06:45.548 --> 06:46.609
Stop. I'm blushing.

06:47.525 --> 06:49.567
We'll need someone
to judge the battle

06:49.582 --> 06:51.583
and possibly give us some coaching.

06:55.495 --> 06:57.496
Ã£ HIP-HOP

07:00.546 --> 07:03.547
He trained you for your exam,
drove you to Kingston.

07:04.461 --> 07:06.477
Ollie's an accommodating guy.

07:07.538 --> 07:09.515
He has a crush on me.

07:12.493 --> 07:14.511
From homophobe
to man-crush exploiter.

07:15.423 --> 07:16.492
You're making some progress.

07:16.507 --> 07:19.497
I'm not exploiting. We're just mates.

07:23.404 --> 07:26.418
I think we just witnessed
our battle-winning move.

07:26.434 --> 07:28.407
Yeah, all three of us.

07:28.423 --> 07:30.412
Where's the rest of the platoon?

07:30.432 --> 07:34.451
Fellas. Oliver, you were due
for our debrief ten minutes ago.

07:35.364 --> 07:37.353
The kids, sir - they needed me.

07:37.373 --> 07:39.391
Mate, you're gonna
struggle to graduate

07:39.406 --> 07:41.364
unless you clean up your attendance.

07:43.392 --> 07:45.394
Mate, if you're too busy for this.

07:45.414 --> 07:49.340
I don't want you back on his
hit-list. I never left it.

07:49.361 --> 07:52.382
Even if I had, I couldn't
think of a worthier cause.

07:54.332 --> 07:56.333
Hey. Cool.

07:56.353 --> 08:00.272
OK, crew. Why don't we start
with a head-slide?

08:03.346 --> 08:06.288
It's like a front chasse,
on your face.

08:06.303 --> 08:08.336
Abigail, you have to help us.

08:09.253 --> 08:11.311
The second-years don't appreciate
you like we do.

08:11.326 --> 08:13.312
Ladies of krump.

08:14.225 --> 08:16.270
Dude, the enemy's invaded.

08:16.286 --> 08:18.271
Secret first-year training.

08:18.287 --> 08:20.288
Say it isn't so, Kat.

08:21.202 --> 08:24.199
Technically, I am a first-year.

08:24.215 --> 08:25.255
And Abigail?

08:25.276 --> 08:28.245
I'm sure your aversion
to team sports still applies.

08:30.254 --> 08:32.236
No.

08:32.251 --> 08:34.197
I like competition.

08:35.234 --> 08:37.187
Excuse me.

08:37.207 --> 08:44.172
Alright. Plie, then isolate your
ribcage, devant, centre,

08:44.187 --> 08:46.145
derriere.

08:46.161 --> 08:48.202
Now, pop it, centre, derriere.

08:49.119 --> 08:52.153
Then do a ron de jon with your
ribcage, so around.

08:52.169 --> 08:54.170
Good. Do the same thing and pop.

08:55.083 --> 08:56.171
You realise what's going on, right?

08:57.084 --> 08:59.070
Second-year is imploding.

08:59.085 --> 09:00.142
There's no love anymore.

09:00.158 --> 09:02.139
So we throw a bonding party!

09:02.155 --> 09:04.140
Miss Histead's off tomorrow night.

09:05.053 --> 09:07.066
Hip-hop themed.

09:07.083 --> 09:10.056
I like it. Tweet it.

09:12.061 --> 09:16.044
How many texts do you send without a
reply before it becomes pathetic?

09:16.064 --> 09:18.030
Eight.
One.

09:25.053 --> 09:29.015
Can't I be less serious
in my own clothes?

09:31.985 --> 09:35.996
Spartacus is sent into
the gladiatorial ring

09:36.011 --> 09:38.017
and forced to kill his best friend.

09:38.037 --> 09:41.980
It is only then, horrified
by his actions,

09:41.999 --> 09:46.915
that he incites his fellow
captives into rebellion.

09:46.931 --> 09:48.999
So... Oh, Tara.

09:49.913 --> 09:51.910
Sorry, Miss Histead.

09:51.930 --> 09:54.956
Tara's back was aching. She needed
extra time to stretch.

09:54.972 --> 09:56.977
For a dance history class?

09:57.890 --> 09:58.950
Take a seat.

10:00.944 --> 10:04.930
Act Two begins with
the escaped captives

10:04.946 --> 10:07.940
celebrating their freedom. Tara!

10:09.850 --> 10:13.916
Dr Wicks said that when the pain
gets really bad, I should...

10:14.829 --> 10:15.865
I should walk it off.

10:15.885 --> 10:19.844
Well, I think you should just keep
walking back to Dr Wicks's office.

10:19.863 --> 10:23.838
I'll take her. Make sure
she gets there safely.

10:48.794 --> 10:51.712
Beach?
Beach.

11:02.711 --> 11:05.661
Hey. You on for another
break session,

11:05.677 --> 11:07.698
'cause I'd love to ditch pas de deux.

11:07.714 --> 11:09.704
I'm a bit flat-out today

11:09.724 --> 11:12.645
and we have to stage
that team-building exercise.

11:12.662 --> 11:14.671
No, you should come.

11:14.691 --> 11:17.629
Yeah, but it's
second-years only, remember?

11:17.653 --> 11:22.612
Anyway, thanks for your help,
but you've probably got your
own stuff to get on with.

11:22.628 --> 11:23.656
No worries.

11:24.669 --> 11:26.634
Little harsh.

11:26.655 --> 11:29.600
Well, consider my
exploiting days over.

11:38.559 --> 11:40.607
I just realised. It's me, isn't it?

11:40.627 --> 11:43.537
You keep going out
with all my room-mates

11:43.554 --> 11:45.542
so you can get closer to me.

11:47.548 --> 11:49.557
What are you doing here?

11:49.577 --> 11:53.512
But I'm with the first-years now.
I really... OK.

11:53.527 --> 11:54.580
Christian.

11:56.521 --> 11:58.479
Oh.

11:58.495 --> 11:59.524
Thanks.

12:00.524 --> 12:04.471
If you break her heart
like you broke Tara's, I'll hurt you.

12:12.444 --> 12:13.485
Hey, guys.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.507
Oh, here he is. How you going?

12:23.427 --> 12:27.385
Oh, sorry. Were we
meant to dress up?

12:27.402 --> 12:31.396
No. But look - Twist It.

12:32.449 --> 12:35.355
I have a surprise for you.

12:35.374 --> 12:37.431
Orange juice.
Fun orange juice.

12:38.345 --> 12:40.350
Oh, right!

12:40.365 --> 12:42.323
Don't get serious on me again.

12:42.339 --> 12:44.353
No, no, it's just I once had

12:44.372 --> 12:46.382
this box of chocolates
with liquid centres

12:46.401 --> 12:50.324
and, wow, it was a head-spin.

12:54.283 --> 12:57.273
Let's get this party started!
Yeah!

12:58.290 --> 12:59.338
What's that?

12:59.353 --> 13:01.303
It's Twist It.

13:01.319 --> 13:04.333
I am a human pretzel!

13:05.246 --> 13:07.255
Right hand, green.

13:11.285 --> 13:14.243
OK, I appreciate that you
can't live without him,

13:14.260 --> 13:16.241
but I need you on mingling.

13:17.265 --> 13:19.242
I... I CAN live without him.

13:23.202 --> 13:26.227
I love you!
I've created a monster.

13:26.243 --> 13:28.225
Rarr!

13:28.244 --> 13:32.235
You know what? I am totally gonna
pash somebody tonight!

13:33.151 --> 13:35.193
Hi, Ben!
Hey...

13:35.209 --> 13:37.198
No. No more of this. No!

13:37.214 --> 13:39.191
Sammy!

13:39.207 --> 13:41.201
Hi, Sammy!

13:41.216 --> 13:44.167
I'm not gonna pash Sammy.

13:44.186 --> 13:46.187
Did you do this?

13:47.105 --> 13:49.146
We just saw the first-years
with fire hoses.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.119
Check upstairs.

13:58.084 --> 14:00.065
Uh, first-years only.

14:01.145 --> 14:04.071
How'd you get a hot tub in there?

14:16.091 --> 14:19.081
Sorry, can I borrow my
girlfriend for a second?

14:24.055 --> 14:27.050
Can I still call you that?
Of course you can.

14:27.967 --> 14:32.009
I'm sorry. I mean it about
dialling things down.

14:32.025 --> 14:33.982
I thought we were cool.

14:35.015 --> 14:38.020
Um... do you think
Christian looks happy?

14:38.934 --> 14:40.018
I don't think Christian looks happy.

14:40.935 --> 14:42.972
I... They're just going
through some stuff...

14:42.992 --> 14:46.934
meeting his dad for the first time.
What did you just say?

14:46.955 --> 14:48.964
Nothing. I...
He met his dad? When?!

14:48.984 --> 14:51.926
You said you
didn't wanna see your dad

14:51.946 --> 14:54.936
and you broke up with me because I
found him and you've visited him?!

14:54.956 --> 14:57.930
How about we don't do this now?
How about let's?!

14:57.950 --> 15:00.951
T, come outside... I don't
wanna talk to you ever again!

15:01.869 --> 15:03.934
I'll take her upstairs.
No, I'm dancing! With Ben!

15:04.850 --> 15:07.856
- Because Ben likes me, don't you?
- Yeah, sure. Um...

15:07.872 --> 15:09.889
Uh... Let's go outside.

15:09.910 --> 15:12.887
Ooh! We're kissing outside!

15:16.814 --> 15:18.815
Stand up! Stand up!

15:21.789 --> 15:23.847
You smell like rainforest.
Yeah, thanks.

15:27.789 --> 15:28.857
Oh!

15:29.774 --> 15:31.755
Come over here.

15:31.772 --> 15:32.800
Sit... sit down.

15:32.820 --> 15:35.794
Sorry!
It's... It's totally fine.

15:36.799 --> 15:38.740
I hear there's a party!

15:38.756 --> 15:42.790
Um... yeah. It's not very good.

15:42.810 --> 15:46.729
Miss Raine's coming!
Miss Raine's coming!

15:46.745 --> 15:48.727
Drain the hot tub!

15:48.746 --> 15:51.704
Whoa, guys.
Drain the hot tub!

15:51.721 --> 15:53.681
Where you going? Don't go.

15:53.702 --> 15:55.750
We'll tell Miss Raine
it was a bonding exercise.

15:56.667 --> 16:00.682
That was the single most
awesome night of my life.

16:04.697 --> 16:08.659
Sorry, comrade.
I think the war's over.

16:13.694 --> 16:15.676
You're still on probation, Tara.

16:15.695 --> 16:19.590
I don't understand why
you'd risk everything again.

16:19.610 --> 16:21.624
You obviously don't care
about your place here.

16:22.652 --> 16:25.590
I DO care!

16:25.610 --> 16:28.596
You don't care about me.
Not anymore.

16:28.615 --> 16:31.618
I think you're in no state
to assess that. More water.

16:35.624 --> 16:38.546
You didn't stick up for me.

16:39.555 --> 16:41.556
After I told you about Saskia,

16:41.576 --> 16:47.496
all you cared about
was protecting the academy.

16:47.516 --> 16:50.518
You can put me on
detention for life. I deserve it.

16:50.534 --> 16:52.483
Yes, you do...

16:53.544 --> 16:55.513
But I should've listened.

16:55.529 --> 16:57.522
I was wrong too.

16:58.539 --> 17:00.520
Although a note for next time...

17:00.540 --> 17:04.534
this is not the best way
to get my attention. Come on.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.345
Ollie.
Just keep doing what you're doing.

17:57.329 --> 17:59.297
What's up?

17:59.318 --> 18:02.320
What's up? You're meant
to be on our side.

18:02.339 --> 18:06.234
I'm an unbiased judge,
evening out the playing field.

18:06.254 --> 18:09.252
And last time I checked,
I didn't owe you anything.

18:09.268 --> 18:11.285
We're just mates, right?

18:14.228 --> 18:15.276
Right.

18:28.180 --> 18:32.183
You're meant to be an army, but
I can't see one shred of unity!

18:44.158 --> 18:46.155
In here, now.

18:46.175 --> 18:48.105
Oh, no, I...
Now!

18:55.085 --> 18:58.106
OK, I'm talking and no-one's
leaving until I'm done.

19:00.112 --> 19:03.118
In 15 minutes, we're meant
to have this hip-hop battle.

19:03.138 --> 19:07.108
As far as I can tell, none of you
are planning on showing.

19:08.025 --> 19:10.098
Let's not - then they'll
know we're too cool to care.

19:11.015 --> 19:15.002
We can be so cool that we never talk
to each other again either.

19:16.074 --> 19:19.017
We have four months left
of second year.

19:20.053 --> 19:22.066
Third year is only gonna be harder.

19:26.001 --> 19:28.974
This war's not about us
beating the first-years...

19:28.994 --> 19:31.008
it's about us being there
for each other.

19:31.028 --> 19:35.030
I don't know about you, but, for me,
that's something worth fighting for.

19:46.895 --> 19:48.951
Come with me.

19:50.905 --> 19:52.953
So is this battle still on, or what?

20:02.936 --> 20:04.930
You trying to bribe the judge?

20:05.842 --> 20:06.907
Nope.

20:15.356 --> 20:19.354
It's a well-established fact
that too much of me gets annoying.

20:19.370 --> 20:21.336
I'm annoying myself right now.

20:21.352 --> 20:23.325
So you've been protecting me?

20:23.341 --> 20:25.306
I'm protecting me.

20:25.326 --> 20:29.253
If I get too addicted to this
and you change your mind,

20:29.269 --> 20:31.314
I don't know how I'll handle that.

20:31.330 --> 20:33.291
I'm not planning on going anywhere.

20:33.307 --> 20:35.257
You can't promise that.

20:48.257 --> 20:52.188
It's after time. They forfeit!

21:09.139 --> 21:13.141
I'm swearing off orange juice
forever. Can we leave it at that?

21:13.160 --> 21:16.163
I just... I can't kiss someone
unless it means something.

21:16.183 --> 21:20.141
It's not how I roll.
You take it seriously? Me too.

21:20.162 --> 21:24.163
I think our rebellious Tara
is going back in her box.

21:25.077 --> 21:27.082
No!

21:27.557 --> 21:29.586
Oh, yeah!

21:29.601 --> 21:31.539
Abigail, over here.

21:33.568 --> 21:35.549
You were saying, Remi?

21:35.570 --> 21:38.536
Listen up - all battles
are your own style.

21:38.556 --> 21:41.526
I'll tell you when to step down.
Let's do this!

21:41.546 --> 21:44.488
Yeah!

21:47.557 --> 21:49.507
Whoo!

22:15.395 --> 22:16.448
Whoo!

22:44.298 --> 22:47.344
Maybe when the boys back home
were playing their war games,

22:47.359 --> 22:49.305
I missed the point.

22:49.325 --> 22:52.307
It wasn't about pretending
to destroy each other.

22:52.326 --> 22:55.312
It was about being united
against a common enemy.

22:57.298 --> 23:01.285
Being on the same side, regardless of
what's happened or what will happen.

23:02.293 --> 23:05.219
Relying on the members
of your battalion.

23:05.239 --> 23:10.246
Because that's the only way you'll
make it out the other end... alive.
