{\an5}<i>Previously on</i> Good Sam...

00:03.602 --> 00:07.073
I spoke with the board.

00:07.140 --> 00:08.742
{\an3}They're not just gonna
hand you the reins

00:08.808 --> 00:10.643
at the end of this.
They're gonna choose between us.

00:20.587 --> 00:22.389
I'm in this with you.

00:22.455 --> 00:23.490
Good.

00:24.424 --> 00:25.725
I don't want to get
our old thing back.

00:25.792 --> 00:27.560
{\an3}I want us to make
a new thing.

00:27.627 --> 00:28.661

my tummy tucks

there's your proof.

I want to be chief,
but I also...

00:39.506 --> 00:41.441

{\an5}Yeah, table's fine.

01:18.878 --> 01:20.780
I picked the table.

You-you should pick
the table you like.

01:22.782 --> 01:25.485
I pick this table.

01:34.627 --> 01:36.429
You love pancakes.

01:36.729 --> 01:38.631
I did.

01:38.698 --> 01:40.633
And I'm sure I still do.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.535
Thanks.

01:42.869 --> 01:45.171
{\an5}I didn't think you'd come.

01:42.869 --> 01:45.171
Course I came.

01:45.238 --> 01:47.874
Look, what we had before
wasn't perfect, but...

01:47.941 --> 01:52.645

about it.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.692
Then maybe we
can enjoy ourselves tonight.

02:05.758 --> 02:06.659
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

Dad, I have to talk about work

02:09.195 --> 02:11.764
{\an3}The whole board will be there,
even the out-of-towners.

02:11.831 --> 02:12.799
Come on, clock out.

02:12.866 --> 02:15.702
{\an1}Have a little fun.
Those votes are already decided.

02:15.768 --> 02:16.803
You don't know that.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.671
{\an3}There might be more
undecided voters

02:18.738 --> 02:20.640
on the board
than you realize, Dad.

02:21.641 --> 02:22.675
Maybe so.

02:22.742 --> 02:23.710
Hmm.

02:23.776 --> 02:24.711
Oh.

02:24.777 --> 02:26.679
{\an1}Thanks.

02:26.746 --> 02:27.714

02:37.724 --> 02:38.758
She kisses me on the lips

{\an3}You realize that, right?
We can't get through breakfast?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.935
We can't be in here fighting
for our relationship

02:49.002 --> 02:51.604
and be out there
fighting over this job.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.373

02:56.910 --> 02:58.678
The Christmas Truce.

02:58.745 --> 02:59.913
{\an5}The what?

02:58.745 --> 02:59.913
World War I,

02:59.979 --> 03:02.649
Brits and Germans locked
in battle.

03:02.715 --> 03:03.883
Christmas Day,

03:03.950 --> 03:06.719
{\an1}fighting stopped and soldiers
who had been killing each other

03:06.786 --> 03:08.755
got out of the trenches

03:08.821 --> 03:10.757
{\an1}and started singing
Christmas carols

03:10.823 --> 03:13.660
{\an1}in the other sides'
languages.

03:14.727 --> 03:17.497
It can be done.

03:17.830 --> 03:19.799
"Parties shall cease

"Jingle Bells" in German...

03:30.710 --> 03:33.479

03:43.790 --> 03:46.526
Then I guess I'll sign it.

03:48.661 --> 03:49.729
Uh...

03:49.796 --> 03:52.565
we should talk about Lex.

No.

{\an3}What happened
between you and Lex

03:55.301 --> 03:57.003

"mines and booby traps" for me.

If you want peace,
you will not bring it up again.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.743

05:27.293 --> 05:29.929

05:53.086 --> 05:54.887

{\an8}I was just saying,
500 bucks a plate,

06:03.162 --> 06:04.997
{\an8}it's a little steep.

06:03.162 --> 06:04.997
{\an8}It's a bargain.

06:05.064 --> 06:06.833

06:06.899 --> 06:08.835

you want it.

06:21.180 --> 06:24.083
{\an8}Uh, actually, I requested
for a rotation in trauma.

06:24.150 --> 06:27.887
{\an7}If that's okay.
Just to change up the pace.

06:27.954 --> 06:29.722
{\an8}I'll take the VAD.

06:29.789 --> 06:31.791

partial sedation.

Smooth edges.

07:12.965 --> 07:15.768
{\an3}Even color
throughout.

07:15.835 --> 07:17.003
Regular in shape.

Betty's in luck.
Look like a classic

{\an5}benign finding.

07:19.038 --> 07:21.808
Hold on, hold on.

07:21.874 --> 07:22.909
Look right there.

07:23.209 --> 07:25.011
You see the spiculated margins?

07:25.077 --> 07:27.113
Scarring
from a previous biopsy?

07:27.180 --> 07:28.147
I don't think so.

07:28.214 --> 07:31.050
We need to get in there
and get a better look.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.819
{\an5}I'll schedule her for a VATS.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.819

Ruby Williams, 73.
Collapsed in her kitchen.

{\an6}Neighbor called
it in.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.160

{\an5}I'm the neighbor.

07:41.227 --> 07:42.128
She was bradycardic

with a heart rate of 30
when we got there.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.865
We got the pacer pads on her...

07:45.932 --> 07:46.933
You're hurting me!

07:46.999 --> 07:47.967
Ruby, hi. I'm Dr. Trulie.

07:48.034 --> 07:49.068

15:55.554 --> 15:59.358
{\an5}SAM: Thank you.

15:55.554 --> 15:59.358
Thanks.

15:59.425 --> 16:02.361
♪ ♪

16:02.428 --> 16:04.396
(Sam gasps)

16:05.497 --> 16:06.632
{\an3}Thank you.

16:06.699 --> 16:09.301
{\an3}Um, will you
hold this for me?

16:12.504 --> 16:14.473
Don't tell. Yeah.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.475
{\an3}Very nice.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.010
{\an3}Oh, I see Rhonda's
already here.

16:18.077 --> 16:20.579
Hustling bids for
her auction items,

16:20.646 --> 16:22.348
{\an4}no doubt.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.348
{\an3}Mm.

16:22.414 --> 16:24.183
There's Calhoun.

16:25.584 --> 16:27.519
Oh, and Patty Gilroy.

16:27.586 --> 16:29.588
Looks like you two

16:29.655 --> 16:30.689
{\an5}might need to get a room.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.689
Very funny.

16:30.756 --> 16:34.226
{\an4}You should put that
in your speech.

16:30.756 --> 16:34.226
(laughs): No.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.395
{\an5}Uh, how about a picture?

16:34.660 --> 16:36.395
GRIFF: Sure.

16:36.462 --> 16:37.730
Loosen up back there.

16:37.796 --> 16:39.698
It's like
rigor mortis has set in.

16:39.765 --> 16:41.700
Rigor mortis doesn't set
in to the large muscles

16:41.767 --> 16:44.036
{\an3}of the back for at least
12 hours postmortem.

16:44.103 --> 16:46.505
{\an1}Assuming normal ATP levels
at the time of death,

16:46.572 --> 16:47.740
{\an5}of course.

16:46.572 --> 16:47.740
{\an3}Of course.

16:47.806 --> 16:49.508
Can I get one
with just the chief?

16:49.575 --> 16:51.343
{\an4}Sorry.

16:49.575 --> 16:51.343
{\an3}What?

16:51.410 --> 16:52.444
{\an3}Uh, just

16:52.511 --> 16:53.545
the chief of the department.

16:53.612 --> 16:55.681
{\an6}Um...

16:53.612 --> 16:55.681
{\an1}Yeah.

16:55.748 --> 16:59.385
{\an1}That would be,
uh, my daughter.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.289
(camera shutter clicking)

17:04.623 --> 17:07.559
Such a happy family.

17:08.093 --> 17:10.028
{\an3}Though I doubt they'll be
smiling like that

17:10.095 --> 17:12.397
{\an3}once they find out
about the vote.

17:12.464 --> 17:14.465
{\an1}What vote?

17:14.532 --> 17:15.800
Chief of Cardiothoracics.

17:15.867 --> 17:18.436
{\an3}Board wants you
to weigh in.

17:18.503 --> 17:19.570
CMO should have a say

17:19.637 --> 17:22.808
in such a crucial staffing
decision, don't you think?

17:22.875 --> 17:26.712
They want me to choose between
my daughter and my ex-husband?

17:26.779 --> 17:30.516
{\an6}Mm.

17:26.779 --> 17:30.516
{\an1}The CMO does not
vote on board matters.

17:30.582 --> 17:31.617
It's unprecedented.

17:31.683 --> 17:35.287
{\an3}Take that up with Byron
Kingsley. He's just there.

17:35.821 --> 17:39.258
Are those shrimp puffs?

17:49.568 --> 17:51.437
{\an5}Hi.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.437
Hi.

17:53.672 --> 17:56.275
Hi.

17:56.675 --> 17:59.611
{\an3}This is the part
where my dad is here

17:59.678 --> 18:00.779
{\an5}with us right now.

17:59.678 --> 18:00.779
{\an3}Yeah.

18:00.846 --> 18:03.615
{\an5}Dr. Griffith.

18:00.846 --> 18:03.615
Mm-hmm. Malcolm.

18:03.682 --> 18:04.783
What are you doing?

18:04.850 --> 18:07.820
I am checking out my daughter's
boyfriend's handshake.

18:07.886 --> 18:10.556
Tells you a lot about a man.
Right, Malcolm?

18:10.622 --> 18:12.524
Dad, please stop.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.526
All right.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.631
So, tell me about yourself.

18:19.698 --> 18:21.567
Oh, what would you like to know?

18:21.633 --> 18:22.634
I don't know.

18:22.701 --> 18:24.536
Interests, hobbies.

18:24.603 --> 18:25.737
Unusual allergies.

18:25.804 --> 18:28.707
Oh. You are not good at this.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.776
Okay, tell me
about your family.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.711
{\an3}Well, I know
about your dad.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.514
I just golfed with him
this last weekend, so,

18:35.581 --> 18:37.416
how's your mom?

18:37.483 --> 18:38.150
My mom?

18:38.217 --> 18:39.685
I would ask you to say "hello,"

18:39.751 --> 18:41.687
but she doesn't like me
very much.

18:41.753 --> 18:43.655
{\an4}Hmm.

18:41.753 --> 18:43.655
Oh.

18:43.722 --> 18:45.524
Oh. You probably know that.

18:45.591 --> 18:46.792
Uh, actually, I don't.

18:46.859 --> 18:49.728
{\an4}We haven't really spoken
since the divorce.

18:46.859 --> 18:49.728
{\an3}Oh.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.663
Well, bet that was messy.

18:51.730 --> 18:52.798
{\an5}It was.

18:51.730 --> 18:52.798
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.666
But it was 12 years ago, so...

18:54.733 --> 18:56.635
No. 12 years.

18:56.702 --> 18:57.870
Wow. Seems like

18:57.936 --> 18:59.638
just yesterday
they joined the board.

18:59.705 --> 19:01.807
{\an3}Huh. Your mother
walked in, and I...

19:01.874 --> 19:04.776
Well, to be honest, I didn't
like her very much, either.

19:04.843 --> 19:06.144
{\an5}Dad!

19:04.843 --> 19:06.144
What?

19:06.211 --> 19:07.913
Can we please talk
about something else?

19:07.980 --> 19:10.148
Sorry. Did not mean
to put you on the spot.

19:10.215 --> 19:12.551
{\an3}Let's talk about something else.
You want to talk about,

19:12.618 --> 19:13.819
uh, my mother?

19:13.886 --> 19:16.154
{\an3}She was a total
narcissist, for a start.

19:16.221 --> 19:18.924
{\an4}Oh. Okay.

19:16.221 --> 19:18.924
Honestly. There were pictures.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.792
You know, we're just gonna...
I'm gonna...

19:20.859 --> 19:23.362
I'll see you in a minute.

19:24.730 --> 19:26.498
I am so sorry.

19:26.565 --> 19:27.432
{\an1}Don't be.

19:27.499 --> 19:29.635
{\an1}It's actually one
of the most normal moments

19:29.701 --> 19:30.836
I've seen with you two.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.704
{\an1}Being embarrassed
in front of your date?

19:32.771 --> 19:34.773
It's classic dad territory.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.642
Well, if you say so.

19:36.708 --> 19:37.910
Your father

19:37.976 --> 19:41.713
wanting a relationship with you,
even though it's not perfect--

19:41.780 --> 19:43.315
it's better
than the alternative.

19:43.382 --> 19:47.219
I didn't know that you don't
speak to your mother.

19:47.286 --> 19:49.354
I didn't even know she was
still on the board. Uh...

19:49.421 --> 19:52.324
I mean, she's still part of
the Kingsley Family Foundation.

19:52.391 --> 19:55.894
You know, it's the Kingsley
family she wants no part of.

19:55.961 --> 19:58.864
I'm sorry. We don't have
to talk about your mom.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.699
It's probably better
if we don't.

20:00.766 --> 20:01.833
Understood.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.802
{\an4}Yeah.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.802
Can I buy you a drink?

20:03.869 --> 20:05.671
Yes, please.

20:05.737 --> 20:07.639

Okay.

21:32.858 --> 21:34.926
First, I'm gonna do this.

21:34.993 --> 21:37.629
(laughs softly)

21:37.696 --> 21:41.366
{\an3}Mmm. Mmm.

22:11.697 --> 22:12.964
{\an1}Oh.

22:13.031 --> 22:15.734
Did you know they
got back together?

22:15.801 --> 22:16.935
Lex and your father? No.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.404
{\an1}But sadly, I can't even say
I'm surprised.

22:19.471 --> 22:21.940
{\an1}I just wish he'd found
a better way to tell you.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.842
I wish she had told me.

22:23.909 --> 22:26.645
Instead, I found
out from Rhonda.

22:26.712 --> 22:27.879
Rhonda?

22:27.946 --> 22:29.948
Yeah. She told me
Dad was looking for me,

22:30.015 --> 22:32.651
and pointed me
in the exact direction

22:32.718 --> 22:33.885
they'd gone.

22:33.952 --> 22:35.087
It all comes back to Rhonda.

22:35.153 --> 22:37.389
{\an4}Between this
and the vote...

22:35.153 --> 22:37.389
{\an3}What vote?

22:37.456 --> 22:41.059
Yeah, she, um...
she's talked the board

22:41.126 --> 22:43.061
into making me vote
for the chief job.

22:43.128 --> 22:44.362
Why would she do that?

22:44.429 --> 22:46.832
To undermine my objectivity
as CMO.

22:46.898 --> 22:48.066
{\an1}But I am gonna
speak with Byron,

22:48.133 --> 22:50.836
{\an1}because she does not
dictate policy.

22:50.902 --> 22:52.437
But don't worry about that.

22:52.504 --> 22:55.907
You're gonna give your speech,
they're gonna love you,

22:55.974 --> 22:58.376
and the votes will come, okay?

22:58.443 --> 23:01.580
Just don't let your father
derail you.

23:02.114 --> 23:04.049
{\an3}I should have
told her at breakfast.

23:04.116 --> 23:06.918
It was never gonna be easy.

23:06.985 --> 23:09.054
{\an4}Hmm.

23:06.985 --> 23:09.054
{\an3}The good news is,
she knows.

23:09.121 --> 23:11.723
The good news is, there's a bar.

23:11.790 --> 23:12.958
I'm on call.

23:13.024 --> 23:16.795
Plus, I'm not here for that.

23:16.862 --> 23:18.396
I want to mingle.

23:18.463 --> 23:21.399
{\an3}I need to know these people,
and they should know me.

23:21.466 --> 23:25.771
{\an1}Okay. Let me make
some introductions.

23:25.837 --> 23:27.739
I can handle myself.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.008
Part I need you
for comes later.

23:30.075 --> 23:32.911
{\an3}(clicks tongue)
Uh-huh.

23:35.013 --> 23:37.983
(sighs)

23:38.049 --> 23:41.887
Oh, Patty, looking gorgeous.

23:41.953 --> 23:42.921
You all by yourself?

23:42.988 --> 23:46.091
{\an3}Mrs. Brooks was just
saying how impressed she is

23:46.158 --> 23:47.159
with Lakeshore's new
director of finance.

23:47.225 --> 23:50.128
Oh. Well, thank you.
I've learned from the best.

23:50.195 --> 23:53.465
{\an3}I'm sure your father has
great plans for your future.

23:53.532 --> 23:55.033
Oh, I actually have some plans
of my own.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.168
Like a community clinic

23:56.234 --> 23:58.136
{\an5}under the Lakeshore...

23:56.234 --> 23:58.136
{\an3}Mrs. Brooks

23:58.203 --> 24:00.205
means business plans,
not passion projects.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.973
{\an5}Well, this would be good
for business.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.973
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

24:02.040 --> 24:02.874
It would raise our profile

24:02.941 --> 24:04.943
{\an1}in the community,
bring in more patients.

24:05.010 --> 24:06.978
Patients who can't pay the bill?

24:07.045 --> 24:07.979
{\an3}I really think
it's worth hearing.

24:08.046 --> 24:10.916
{\an3}I have heard it, and
the answer was "no" then.

24:10.982 --> 24:12.851
It's "no" now.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.824
(indistinct chatter)

24:24.196 --> 24:26.464
{\an1}I think this year's
entertainment has been the best

24:26.531 --> 24:30.101
{\an6}by far.

24:26.531 --> 24:30.101
{\an1}You don't like the way
I do business, I get it.

24:30.168 --> 24:31.203
{\an1}But leave my family
out of it.

24:31.269 --> 24:34.573
Your business and your family
are the same thing.

24:34.639 --> 24:37.976
That's why the board is
questioning your objectivity.

24:38.043 --> 24:41.079
{\an3}If I have to vote,
I will vote.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.081
It's not a problem.

24:43.148 --> 24:45.217
Well, if it is, I told Byron

24:45.283 --> 24:48.687
I would be happy
to step in as CMO.

24:49.020 --> 24:50.255
You did what?

24:50.322 --> 24:52.557
Someone needs
to check you, Vivian.

24:52.624 --> 24:55.126
You've been abusing your power
for too long,

24:55.193 --> 24:57.128
and now you're taking money
out of my pocket

24:57.195 --> 24:58.997
{\an5}to serve your...

24:57.195 --> 24:58.997
Lower your voice.

24:59.064 --> 25:00.832
Excuse me?

25:02.234 --> 25:04.903
Lots of eyes in this room.

25:04.970 --> 25:07.038
And whatever our differences,

25:07.105 --> 25:10.242
{\an1}we've both worked too hard
and come too far

25:10.308 --> 25:14.946
{\an1}to be reduced to a catfight
at a cocktail party.

25:15.013 --> 25:17.015
Lovely to see you, Vivian.

25:17.082 --> 25:18.884
{\an1}Likewise.

25:18.950 --> 25:21.219
Oh, and Rhonda,

25:21.286 --> 25:25.991
if you want my job,
come and get it.

25:26.992 --> 25:28.927
I plan to.

25:34.099 --> 25:35.200
{\an1}I know the clinic
is not an easy sell,

25:35.267 --> 25:36.301
{\an1}but I thought
he'd at least hear me out.

25:36.368 --> 25:39.237
Now I got to go tell your mom
it's not happening.

25:39.304 --> 25:41.206
You can't just give up on this.

25:41.273 --> 25:43.541
Talk to him,
one on one.

25:43.608 --> 25:47.212
You always tell me
to stand up for my vision,

25:47.279 --> 25:49.214
and now it's my turn.

25:49.281 --> 25:52.951
You have a good idea
so go fight for it.

25:54.152 --> 25:56.087
Okay.

25:56.154 --> 25:58.156
{\an4}Hi.

25:56.154 --> 25:58.156
Whiskey double.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.959
That good, huh?

26:02.260 --> 26:04.629
{\an3}I'm trying to understand
where my son got the impression

26:04.696 --> 26:07.165
{\an3}that I want his opinion
on how to do my job.

26:07.232 --> 26:09.267
{\an4}(laughs)
Well, if you find out,
let me know.

26:09.334 --> 26:11.169
I'm in a similar
situation myself.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.337
I know you are.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.606
{\an5}Now's your chance.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.606
{\an1}BYRON:
The very idea

26:14.673 --> 26:17.108
that you and your daughter
are in competition for...

26:17.175 --> 26:19.110
{\an3}for that job--
it's outrageous.

26:19.177 --> 26:20.278
{\an1}It's where we are,
my friend.

26:20.345 --> 26:21.613
{\an5}She can't replace you.

26:20.345 --> 26:21.613
{\an1}(chuckles)

26:21.680 --> 26:23.581
{\an3}You and I would never
let that happen.

26:23.648 --> 26:26.151
{\an3}We're gonna keep those kids
in line one way or the other.

26:26.217 --> 26:27.919
(Malcolm clears throat)

26:29.120 --> 26:31.089
Hey.

26:32.090 --> 26:34.025
{\an3}A word?

26:39.197 --> 26:41.800
You have a deal with Byron.

26:42.133 --> 26:43.168
Sam...

26:43.234 --> 26:44.269
Makes perfect sense.

26:44.336 --> 26:46.104
You think
I would do that to you?

26:46.171 --> 26:47.272
I think our truce is over.

26:47.339 --> 26:50.075
{\an5}MAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Sam Griffith, please

26:50.141 --> 26:51.176
report to the stage.

26:51.242 --> 26:53.078
"Hostilities to resume

26:53.144 --> 26:55.013
{\an3}following proper
notification."

26:55.080 --> 26:57.015
I'd say this qualifies.

27:01.252 --> 27:03.254
{\an3}I'm sorry I went
about this the wrong way,

27:03.321 --> 27:06.024
{\an3}but Vivian and I-- we have
put a lot of time into this.

27:06.091 --> 27:08.159
Vivian's using you, son.

27:08.226 --> 27:10.095
All you are to her

27:10.161 --> 27:12.263
is a way to get to me.

27:12.330 --> 27:15.033
Did you really forget that?

27:18.236 --> 27:20.171
{\an5}SAM:
Good evening.

27:20.238 --> 27:23.274
I am Dr. Sam Griffith,

27:23.341 --> 27:27.078
Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

27:30.415 --> 27:33.685
In my department,
we don't just have heart.

27:33.752 --> 27:36.154
We have
the whole thoracic cavity.

27:36.221 --> 27:39.124
(soft laughter)

27:40.325 --> 27:42.093
(clears throat)

27:42.160 --> 27:44.062
Thank you.

27:47.332 --> 27:50.068
You must be Erin.

27:50.135 --> 27:51.036
Oh, God.

27:51.102 --> 27:53.338
{\an1}My mom tried to set you up
with me, didn't she?

27:53.405 --> 27:54.439
She always does that.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.741
Last week, she made me go out
with her podiatrist.

27:56.808 --> 27:59.310
{\an3}Ooh. Podiatrist? Hope he didn't
make you foot the bill.

27:59.377 --> 28:02.247
If he did, I would have
given him... the boot.

28:02.313 --> 28:04.115
(laughs) That's good.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.284
(rapid beeping)

28:06.351 --> 28:08.820
{\an1}What is that?
Why is it doing that?

28:08.887 --> 28:12.957
Her blood pressure's dropping,
and her heart rate's going up.

28:14.759 --> 28:16.728
{\an5}Is that blood?

28:14.759 --> 28:16.728
{\an3}Yeah, her resection
site reopened.

28:16.795 --> 28:18.463
{\an4}What?

28:16.795 --> 28:18.463
{\an3}The spot where I removed
the mass is bleeding.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.298
{\an3}I have to go back in
and seal it off.

28:20.365 --> 28:22.133
{\an5}(beep)

28:20.365 --> 28:22.133
{\an3}Tell the OR
we're coming back.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.309
{\an1}Sam? Sam?
Sam, listen.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.311
Whatever you think
you saw with Byron,

28:33.378 --> 28:34.546
that's not what it looks like.

28:34.612 --> 28:37.449
{\an3}Really? And what about this?
Is this not what it looks like?

28:37.515 --> 28:39.317
'Cause it feels
pretty familiar.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.352
{\an5}It's complicated.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.352
No, it isn't.

28:41.419 --> 28:42.420
I have been trying

28:42.487 --> 28:44.289
to keep up with you in a game

28:44.355 --> 28:45.723
that you've had rigged
the entire time.

28:45.790 --> 28:48.159
{\an5}And the two of you...

28:45.790 --> 28:48.159
Maybe we should go...

28:48.226 --> 28:49.160
{\an5}talk somewhere privately.

28:48.226 --> 28:49.160
{\an3}I...

28:49.227 --> 28:51.329
{\an3}I don't have anything
to say to you right now.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.431
Look, I didn't want you
to find out this way.

28:53.498 --> 28:55.433
But I also don't need
your permission.

28:55.500 --> 28:57.268
{\an5}Okay.

28:55.500 --> 28:57.268
I can do what I want

28:57.335 --> 28:59.070
{\an5}and date who I want.

28:57.335 --> 28:59.070
{\an3}Yeah.

28:59.137 --> 29:00.205
(clattering)

29:00.271 --> 29:03.041
(people gasping)

29:03.508 --> 29:05.443
{\an4}He's out.
Let's turn him.

29:03.508 --> 29:05.443
{\an3}Okay.

29:05.510 --> 29:08.346
{\an4}Everyone back up.
Give him some space.

29:05.510 --> 29:08.346
One, two, three.

29:08.413 --> 29:11.749
{\an5}Oh. He's bleeding out.

29:08.413 --> 29:11.749
All right, get pressure on it.

29:11.816 --> 29:13.485
{\an1}I can't get control
until I get this out.

29:13.551 --> 29:15.286
{\an1}Then do it fast.
Don't think about it.

29:15.353 --> 29:18.089
{\an5}Here, here's a towel.

29:15.353 --> 29:18.089
(exhales)

29:18.156 --> 29:20.191
(crowd gasping)

29:20.258 --> 29:22.026
{\an1}Here.

29:23.361 --> 29:26.297
(inhales, groans)

29:26.364 --> 29:27.365
If I put any more pressure
on this,

29:27.432 --> 29:29.334
his airway's gonna collapse.
The cut's too deep.

29:29.400 --> 29:30.268
You got to tie off
the external jugular.

29:30.335 --> 29:33.505
{\an6}With what?

29:30.335 --> 29:33.505
Anybody have any dental floss?

29:33.571 --> 29:35.340
{\an5}A manicure kit?

29:33.571 --> 29:35.340
{\an3}I need ice,

29:35.406 --> 29:38.276
hand sanitizer and
more light, please.

29:38.343 --> 29:39.377
{\an5}Come on.

29:38.343 --> 29:39.377
There you go.

29:39.444 --> 29:42.080
{\an5}Yes, yes, thank you.

29:39.444 --> 29:42.080
Here, scissors.

29:43.548 --> 29:46.985
I'm extending the incision.
(groans)

29:47.418 --> 29:49.220
GRIFF:
Tweezers.

29:49.487 --> 29:52.223
There's the lacerated vessel.
Got it.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.958
{\an6}Hold that?

29:52.290 --> 29:53.958
{\an1}Yeah.

29:58.263 --> 30:01.199
Tying off the vessel.

30:01.266 --> 30:02.400
{\an5}Good, good.

30:01.266 --> 30:02.400
Mm-hmm.

30:02.467 --> 30:04.269
Ambulance has just landed.

30:04.335 --> 30:05.436
Step back, Dr. Trulie!

30:05.503 --> 30:06.371
What? Why can't I help?

30:06.437 --> 30:10.041
Because your judgment
is clearly impaired.

30:12.477 --> 30:15.280
Come on, come on,
get 'em in here!

30:15.346 --> 30:17.048
{\an1}Go.

30:23.521 --> 30:27.091
(siren wailing)

30:27.425 --> 30:29.160
Joey?

30:29.227 --> 30:32.063
{\an1}Hey.

30:33.364 --> 30:34.499
{\an5}How was the gala?

30:33.364 --> 30:34.499
{\an3}Don't ask.

30:34.566 --> 30:36.534
{\an6}You have Ruby
Williams' results?

30:34.566 --> 30:36.534
{\an1}Yeah.

30:36.601 --> 30:40.004
{\an4}I was just about
to walk them in right now.

30:36.601 --> 30:40.004
{\an3}I got it.

30:43.541 --> 30:45.410
I have your biopsy results.

30:45.476 --> 30:47.345
I didn't want to make you wait

30:47.412 --> 30:49.480
{\an3}for it while
I got changed.

30:49.547 --> 30:53.384
You have a condition
called sarcoidosis.

30:53.451 --> 30:54.552
{\an3}It's causing
the inflammation

30:54.619 --> 30:56.487
and the scarring in your lungs.

30:56.554 --> 30:58.523
{\an3}That's why you went
into heart block,

30:58.590 --> 31:00.391
and why you've been
coughing at night.

31:00.458 --> 31:02.393
It sounds serious.

31:02.460 --> 31:04.329
{\an3}LEX:
It's a chronic condition,

31:04.395 --> 31:07.131
but it's manageable.

31:07.198 --> 31:09.100
Oh.

31:09.634 --> 31:13.071
{\an5}You're gonna be okay.

31:09.634 --> 31:13.071
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

31:15.206 --> 31:16.341
{\an1}Are we?

31:23.715 --> 31:28.486
Look, all I want is for you
to be happy.

31:28.553 --> 31:31.489
{\an3}And I'm glad
that you are, but

31:31.556 --> 31:33.658
this woman is a stranger to me.

31:33.725 --> 31:37.528
It's not her fault, It's mine,
baby. I-I should have told you.

31:37.595 --> 31:38.563
Why didn't you?

31:38.630 --> 31:42.533
{\an1}I was scared. I didn't know
how you would take it.

31:42.600 --> 31:46.471
{\an1}I kept saying I was waiting
for the right time.

31:46.537 --> 31:48.506
But look how much time we lost

31:48.573 --> 31:51.309
{\an1}waiting for the right time
to come.

31:53.077 --> 31:55.613
{\an6}NURSE:
I need to take
a blood sample.

31:55.680 --> 31:59.450
{\an1}I'm gonna send a specialist
to answer all of your questions.

31:59.517 --> 32:02.220
{\an6}Okay?

31:59.517 --> 32:02.220
Thank you.

32:02.287 --> 32:03.655
Actually,

32:03.721 --> 32:06.491
when you're done with Ruby,
I'm next.

32:06.557 --> 32:09.427
{\an4}Okay.

32:06.557 --> 32:09.427
{\an3}Thank you.

32:09.494 --> 32:12.497
Hey, Darius, there was a lot

32:12.563 --> 32:13.665
of blood vessel damage
in your neck.

32:13.731 --> 32:15.600
{\an1}I guess I just
lost my balance.

32:15.667 --> 32:17.635
Well, actually, you
lost consciousness.

32:17.702 --> 32:20.004
That's why the force of
your fall was so severe.

32:20.071 --> 32:21.939
{\an6}SAM:
Your coworker dropped
off your backpack.

32:22.006 --> 32:23.675
{\an1}You have a lot
of cold medication in there.

32:23.741 --> 32:25.476
{\an1}Have you been
feeling sick lately?

32:25.543 --> 32:28.413
Y-Yeah.
Uh, just like a head cold,

32:28.479 --> 32:29.947
but, uh, it won't go away.

32:30.014 --> 32:32.550
{\an3}Don't suppose you told a
doctor about these symptoms?

32:32.617 --> 32:34.485
I didn't tell anybody.

32:34.552 --> 32:35.586
{\an1}Why not?

32:35.653 --> 32:37.588
I work in food service.

32:37.655 --> 32:40.391
One sniffle,
and they send you home.

32:40.458 --> 32:41.559
{\an4}Mm.

32:40.458 --> 32:41.559
I don't have

32:41.626 --> 32:43.561
any more sick days,
and I need the work,

32:43.628 --> 32:45.530
so I just kept taking
the cold meds.

32:45.596 --> 32:47.465
But you didn't get better...

32:47.532 --> 32:50.234
'Cause it's not a cold.

32:51.703 --> 32:53.638
You have mitral stenosis.

32:53.705 --> 32:55.673
{\an3}It's a narrowing
of one of the valves

32:55.740 --> 32:59.644
{\an1}in your heart, and the symptoms
can mirror a cold.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.979
{\an6}GRIFF:
But cold medication
makes it worse. Elevates

33:02.046 --> 33:03.981
{\an3}your blood pressure,
restricts your blood vessels

33:04.048 --> 33:06.451
{\an3}and adds stress to the heart
that it can't take.

33:06.517 --> 33:07.585
{\an3}That's why
you passed out.

33:07.652 --> 33:08.986
{\an3}SAM:
Darius,

33:09.053 --> 33:13.324
{\an1}we have to replace
the valve in your heart.

33:13.658 --> 33:16.361
(laughs softly)

33:18.529 --> 33:20.732
(clicks tongue, laughs)

33:20.798 --> 33:24.602
That sounds like it's gonna be
a lot of sick days.

33:24.669 --> 33:27.472
{\an3}GRIFF:
Lot of calcification

33:27.538 --> 33:28.473
in this mitral valve.

33:28.539 --> 33:30.074
{\an5}It's gonna make it
harder to resect.

33:28.539 --> 33:30.074
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

33:30.141 --> 33:31.709
I can't believe
he didn't tell anyone

33:31.776 --> 33:34.278
what was going on with him.

33:35.646 --> 33:37.615
{\an1}LEX:
Maybe he couldn't find

33:37.682 --> 33:40.318
the right time.

33:40.685 --> 33:43.554
I just had my blood drawn.
My alcohol content

33:43.621 --> 33:44.689
is zero point zero,

33:44.756 --> 33:45.790
and this is my patient.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.625
{\an5}Your patient?

33:45.857 --> 33:47.625
I'm in trauma today.

33:47.692 --> 33:51.295
This is trauma.

33:54.432 --> 33:55.500
Okay.

34:01.706 --> 34:04.409
Metz to me.

34:16.120 --> 34:19.389
You know you're the one whose
judgment is impaired, right?

34:19.456 --> 34:20.257
{\an3}Excuse me?

34:20.324 --> 34:21.692
{\an1}You attacked me
professionally tonight,

34:21.759 --> 34:23.728
{\an1}a line I never thought
I'd see you cross.

34:23.795 --> 34:24.829
You want to talk to me
about crossing lines?

34:24.896 --> 34:27.831
I told you I was gonna start
putting myself first.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.234
You left out the part
where that was about my father!

34:30.301 --> 34:34.138
This is about my happiness.
You said you supported that.

34:34.205 --> 34:37.775
And I meant it, Lex,
but I don't know how to do this.

34:37.842 --> 34:40.710
Then let's not do it.

34:40.777 --> 34:43.147
{\an5}What do you mean?

34:40.777 --> 34:43.147
You don't need

34:43.214 --> 34:44.815
to worry about your best friend
being with your dad

34:44.882 --> 34:48.386
because you and I
are not friends.

34:52.723 --> 34:55.426
♪ ♪

35:03.768 --> 35:05.636
(sighs)

35:05.703 --> 35:08.406
Ooh.

35:09.507 --> 35:11.375
(sighs)

35:12.677 --> 35:14.612
You pitched the clinic idea

35:14.679 --> 35:15.713
{\an5}to my father already.

35:14.679 --> 35:15.713
{\an1}What?

35:15.780 --> 35:18.783
Yeah, yeah, I-I...
well, I pitched <i> an</i> idea

35:18.850 --> 35:20.785
a while ago,
but smaller in scale,

35:20.852 --> 35:23.421
{\an5}less polished.

35:20.852 --> 35:23.421
But he shut it down.

35:23.488 --> 35:24.355
Yeah.

35:24.422 --> 35:26.591
Why didn't you tell me
about any of this?

35:26.657 --> 35:27.658
I didn't think it was relevant.

35:27.725 --> 35:28.759
Why wouldn't it be relevant?

35:28.826 --> 35:30.661
Because I thought
you'd get a "yes."

35:30.728 --> 35:31.796
{\an5}Because he's my father?

35:30.728 --> 35:31.796
{\an1}Because

35:31.863 --> 35:36.534
it's a great pitch, and yes,
because he's your father.

35:36.601 --> 35:37.802
(laughs)

35:37.869 --> 35:38.903
So that is why you hired me?

35:38.970 --> 35:41.806
I hired you because
you are an excellent candidate

35:41.873 --> 35:44.742
{\an1}who shares my vision
of this hospital's future.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.711
{\an1}But, Malcolm,
this is business.

35:46.777 --> 35:48.145
And it would be naive to think

35:48.212 --> 35:50.581
{\an1}that your father's position
on the board

35:50.648 --> 35:53.518
wasn't part of the calculus.

35:53.851 --> 35:55.753
I thought we were partners.

35:55.820 --> 35:59.223
{\an1}We are, but for this clinic
to succeed,

35:59.290 --> 36:01.859
we are gonna have to play
every advantage we have.

36:01.926 --> 36:04.595
Yeah, well,
I'm definitely feeling played.

36:04.662 --> 36:05.930
You know, I'm just...

36:05.997 --> 36:09.500
I'm having trouble
seeing the advantage.

36:21.846 --> 36:23.014
(clears throat)

36:23.080 --> 36:26.851
{\an5}All right, look, I should
have told you about Lex.

36:23.080 --> 36:26.851
Don't.

36:26.918 --> 36:29.253
And as far as the
job's concerned,

36:29.320 --> 36:31.789
I'll talk to Byron, and
I'll make sure he knows

36:31.856 --> 36:34.659
{\an3}that I want a fair fight
as much as you do.

36:34.725 --> 36:35.927
{\an5}Whatever you say, Dad.

36:34.725 --> 36:35.927
{\an3}Come on.

36:35.993 --> 36:37.929
I still think
this can work with us.

36:37.995 --> 36:39.864
After what happened tonight?

36:39.931 --> 36:41.832
We saved a patient tonight.

36:41.899 --> 36:44.802
One of many lives
that we've saved.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.871
While also trying
to kill each other.

36:46.938 --> 36:48.940
I don't think
those two things go together.

36:49.006 --> 36:50.942
{\an1}Well, that's why you have
to keep 'em separate.

36:51.008 --> 36:54.211
{\an1}That's maybe why tonight went
a little sideways for you.

36:54.278 --> 36:57.214
You think
that tonight was my fault?

36:57.281 --> 36:59.917
I think you have to separate
the personal and professional,

36:59.984 --> 37:02.219
{\an4}or you will suffer,
yes, whether

36:59.984 --> 37:02.219
(scoffs)

37:02.286 --> 37:04.255
{\an1}it's competing with me or not,
or losing a patient, or...

37:04.322 --> 37:06.991
{\an5}No, I'm good on the fatherly
advice for the moment.

37:04.322 --> 37:06.991
{\an1}All right.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.893
If you don't want
to hear it from me,

37:08.960 --> 37:10.828
ask your mother how she does it.

37:10.895 --> 37:13.764
{\an1}She's a black belt at
compartmentalizing. Look at her.

37:13.831 --> 37:15.833
She can handle anything,

37:15.900 --> 37:20.471
including having to vote
for one of us.

37:28.813 --> 37:30.848
Oh.

37:30.915 --> 37:33.651
Tell me you're voting for me.

37:33.718 --> 37:34.452
What?

37:34.518 --> 37:35.586
If I am gonna fight
Byron's plan

37:35.653 --> 37:40.691
to block me, I need to know
that I have your support.

37:40.758 --> 37:42.727
(sighs)

37:42.793 --> 37:44.929
I... I can't.

37:44.996 --> 37:46.097
I can't go on record

37:46.163 --> 37:50.701
about how I am gonna vote.
It-it wouldn't be objective.

37:51.869 --> 37:53.771
Got it.

37:53.838 --> 37:55.773
Oh, Sam.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.742
It doesn't change anything.

37:57.808 --> 37:58.909
I am still your mother.

37:58.976 --> 38:01.479
It's okay, Mom. I get it.

38:01.846 --> 38:03.314
It's fine.

38:03.381 --> 38:06.717
I'm gonna win this,
with or without your vote.

38:11.689 --> 38:13.658
Ah...

38:18.963 --> 38:21.432
{\an1}So, it was a piece
of tissue that hemorrhaged,

38:21.499 --> 38:25.836
but the repair went perfectly,
and she should be stable now.

38:25.903 --> 38:29.540
Thank you so much.

38:30.408 --> 38:32.943
What if this was all my mom's
master plan to get us together?

38:33.010 --> 38:35.980
{\an1}Wow. Well, that would be
a very elaborate ruse.

38:36.047 --> 38:38.683
Mm. Well, I wouldn't
put it past her.

38:38.749 --> 38:39.784
(chuckles)

38:40.518 --> 38:44.789
That being said, um,
I would love to buy you dinner

38:44.855 --> 38:47.558
for everything that you did.

38:47.892 --> 38:49.827
Um...

38:49.894 --> 38:52.029
gosh, you know,
I think I will

38:52.096 --> 38:57.034
maybe live
to regret this, but, uh...

38:57.101 --> 39:01.605
my-my heart is still
stuck on someone else.

39:01.672 --> 39:02.940
Wow.

39:03.007 --> 39:04.942
The old "it's not you, it's me"

39:05.009 --> 39:06.811
even before the first date.

39:06.877 --> 39:08.979
(both chuckle)

39:09.046 --> 39:10.347
Well, look, I know

39:10.414 --> 39:12.016
{\an1}the podiatrist is out,
but for the record,

39:12.083 --> 39:15.853
I think you still deserve
to be swept off your feet.

39:16.854 --> 39:19.690
(laughs)

39:20.024 --> 39:23.561
{\an3}(laughing)

39:24.895 --> 39:26.831
{\an1}Hey.

39:28.165 --> 39:30.968
You look like you've had
as long a day as I have.

39:31.035 --> 39:32.903
I was wrong about your dad.

39:32.970 --> 39:35.106
{\an5}What do you mean?

39:32.970 --> 39:35.106
{\an3}Him

39:35.172 --> 39:37.708
asking about my mom at the gala.

39:38.075 --> 39:40.811
Yeah, it wasn't just
some friendly chitchat.

39:40.878 --> 39:42.780
What was it?

39:42.847 --> 39:45.082
An angle. A play.

39:45.149 --> 39:47.418
Yeah, my mom
just called,

39:47.485 --> 39:49.153
said Dr. Griffith reached out
to see

39:49.220 --> 39:51.055
if she'd be willing
to vote for your next chief

39:51.122 --> 39:52.389
of the department.

39:52.456 --> 39:54.125
{\an3}And you know, things
got a little tense

39:54.191 --> 39:56.861
{\an3}between me and your mom today,
but what your dad did-- this

39:56.927 --> 39:57.995
is some next level.

39:58.062 --> 40:01.632
Malcolm... it wasn't him.

40:02.133 --> 40:05.870
It was me. I called her.

40:13.010 --> 40:14.111
Why?

40:14.178 --> 40:18.082
I'm trying
to turn the tide here,

40:18.149 --> 40:19.416
{\an1}and her vote
could be the key.

40:19.483 --> 40:21.986
I'm working
to gather support, and

40:22.052 --> 40:23.554
{\an1}clearly, your dad's
already made his decision.

40:23.621 --> 40:27.792
So, I'm-I'm just an
advantage for you to play, too.

40:27.858 --> 40:28.926
What? No.

40:29.894 --> 40:33.097
This is my business.
This is not personal.

40:33.164 --> 40:36.066
How is this not personal, Sam?!

40:36.133 --> 40:37.434
She is my mother.

40:37.501 --> 40:39.470
I told you I didn't
want to talk to her.

40:39.537 --> 40:42.807
I told you I didn't even want
to think about her!

40:42.873 --> 40:44.141
I'm sorry.

40:44.208 --> 40:47.745
I have to end this war.

40:49.246 --> 40:52.883
You ended something, all right.
