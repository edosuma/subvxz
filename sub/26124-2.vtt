- Dropped out.

00:34.910 --> 00:36.480
- I might go back, but...
- No, no, no.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.538
Education's wasted on the youth.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.537
Classroom's a box.
What you gonna learn In a box?

00:41.620 --> 00:44.202
Hmm. Uh, Ijust said that

Bet you did.
And now you here in the big city

00:46.880 --> 00:48.370

00:48.750 --> 00:50.627
From the University of Life As Lived.

00:50.710 --> 00:52.086
Yes. Yeah.

00:52.880 --> 00:55.212
I see it all in your eyes.

00:55.840 --> 00:57.842
It's as plain as day.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.970
My name's Larry Brown.

01:03.140 --> 01:04.550
Brenda Peterson.

01:04.980 --> 01:07.551
Hey, you. Go.
Get your ass out of my seat.

01:07.650 --> 01:10.528
...keep your personal
belongings with you at all times.

01:10.820 --> 01:13.277
- You got a crib?
- A what?

01:14.150 --> 01:16.482
A coop. Place to stay.

01:16.780 --> 01:21.069
Oh. My mom has this cousin
I've never met. I'll see how it goes.

01:21.450 --> 01:22.940
I want to ask you a question,

01:23.540 --> 01:25.451
and I'm gonna answer
that question for you.

01:25.620 --> 01:26.826
Okay.

01:28.540 --> 01:29.996
What's your dream?

01:30.920 --> 01:33.832
What is it about the big city
that brought you here?

01:34.630 --> 01:36.837
- Well, I...
- Shut.

01:37.260 --> 01:38.670
Said I was gonna answer it for you.

01:40.640 --> 01:42.301
YOU wanna be an actress.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.470
Okay, now you're scaring me.

01:50.570 --> 01:52.936
Oh, it's your lucky day,
Brenda Peterson.

01:53.440 --> 01:55.317
I mean, with my industry connections,

01:55.700 --> 01:57.941
and of course, after we get
to know each other a little better,

01:58.030 --> 02:02.364
I can most definitely offer you
the proper assistance and direction.

02:02.740 --> 02:05.243
That's what I need. Directions.

02:06.620 --> 02:09.202
We gonna get along right fine,
you and me.

02:09.290 --> 02:12.373
How do I get to this address?

02:12.750 --> 02:16.754
I'm supposed to meet a guy at 3:00,
and I really don't wanna blow it.

02:16.840 --> 02:19.718
Now boaro’ing
at Gate No. 7, Tra/lways...

02:20.760 --> 02:22.921
It's cool. I'll find it.

02:27.730 --> 02:29.391
You know they're gonna
exploit you, right?

02:30.400 --> 02:32.857
You gonna get yourself exploited!

04:11.370 --> 04:12.416
Ta-da!

04:12.500 --> 04:14.570
- Irene, what the fuck?
- Hey, hey, look.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.166
Let me ask you this, all right?

04:17.500 --> 04:21.789
Which one of yous doesn't wanna
triple their daily takeaway?

04:21.880 --> 04:23.086
Now let me see hands.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.249
All right.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.709
Watch this.

04:30.020 --> 04:34.434
All right, take that, take this.
Some props. Here we go.

04:35.270 --> 04:36.760
Where the fuck's he going?

04:37.440 --> 04:40.318
All right. Irene,
put the thing in the thing.

04:40.400 --> 04:41.480
Okay.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.231
This ain't gonna be pretty.

04:45.570 --> 04:48.118
All right, window goes up,
this is you.

04:51.080 --> 04:53.071
All right. Thank you.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.950
You keep dancing.

04:55.040 --> 04:56.166
Oh!

04:57.710 --> 05:00.201
Another one? Thank you. Look at that.

05:00.380 --> 05:02.917
I got tipped twice
for one pat on the ass.

05:03.090 --> 05:05.172
That's nice work if you can get it.
Know what I mean?

05:05.260 --> 05:06.716
What happens the third time?

05:07.760 --> 05:09.421
I don't know.
You play fucking patty cakes.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.512
I signed up for show. No touch.

05:11.600 --> 05:12.635
Hey, don't knock it.

05:12.730 --> 05:14.800
The girls at that joint
over on 49th Street,

05:14.890 --> 05:16.551
they are making money hand over fist.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.356
That's right. Okay?

05:18.440 --> 05:19.646
Now, rules.

05:19.770 --> 05:21.567
Rule number one, all right?

05:21.730 --> 05:24.528
You gotta make sure
the mook ain't a cop.

05:25.240 --> 05:26.525
Second rule.

05:27.530 --> 05:30.693
You make sure
he don't touch you anywhere

05:30.790 --> 05:32.997
that you don't guide him first, okay?

05:33.080 --> 05:34.570
What, like, internally?

05:37.290 --> 05:38.996
No. Fuck this.

05:39.630 --> 05:40.915
What? Dee.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.251
- Dee.
- Come back.

05:42.340 --> 05:44.717
You ask me,
we'll make a shitload more in tips

05:44.800 --> 05:46.336
than if they're just
sticking money in the slot.

05:46.430 --> 05:47.920
That's right. Very wise.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.550
Okay. Third rule.

05:50.640 --> 05:52.710
You make sure his hand

05:53.270 --> 05:55.386
goes through the partition
to you, all right?

05:55.480 --> 05:58.438
You don't put any part of yourself
onto his side.

05:58.520 --> 05:59.726
And if you do,

05:59.860 --> 06:02.021
make sure it's something
you can live without.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.559
Look, don't worry, all right?

06:09.660 --> 06:12.367
Anything happens, there's a button
on the side of the window,

06:12.450 --> 06:13.690
you press that.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.206
And if that don't work, then...

06:16.870 --> 06:17.859
Then what?

06:17.960 --> 06:19.279
- Yell.
- Yell.

06:21.500 --> 06:22.626
Okay.

06:22.960 --> 06:25.463
This is a good thing! For all of us.

06:26.170 --> 06:27.376
This is progress!

06:28.050 --> 06:29.426
Tell them.

06:31.390 --> 06:32.550
Yeah.

06:33.180 --> 06:34.886
No such thing as free money.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.437
Good set last night, right?

06:39.850 --> 06:41.056
Great set.

06:41.650 --> 06:43.220
I like where you're going with it.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.390
- More personal.
- Finally, right?

06:45.690 --> 06:49.569
'Cause honestly, all that
"Rimbaud is my spirit animal" bullshit

06:49.740 --> 06:51.526
was starting to give me hemorrhoids.

06:51.910 --> 06:55.744
Him, Baudelaire,
Apollinaire, Frigidaire,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.241
and all those other bad-boy poseurs.

06:58.540 --> 07:00.701
Rimbaud wasn't a poseur.

07:01.830 --> 07:04.742
"I am a beast, a nigger.
But I could be saved.

07:04.840 --> 07:06.046
"You are sham niggers."

07:06.460 --> 07:07.586
No offense, bro.

07:09.180 --> 07:12.001
"I enter the true kingdom
of the children of Ham."

07:12.100 --> 07:14.466
- Ham and a side of hash browns.
- Exactement.

07:15.810 --> 07:18.426
You wanna make honest art?
Look to where you've been.

07:24.070 --> 07:25.219
Sign it for me?

07:27.320 --> 07:29.231
Why don't you
come back down again tonight?

07:31.110 --> 07:32.691
I'll have a real gift for you.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.236
IfI can get in for free.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.920
Where the hell is my light meter?

07:54.550 --> 07:57.053
Where's my fucking wimple?

07:57.220 --> 07:58.630
It's on your head.

08:00.100 --> 08:01.385
I love that word.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.641
- Joss, can you get Harvey for me?
- Yeah.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.186
"Wimple."

08:17.830 --> 08:19.570
Hey, Candy says...

08:20.080 --> 08:21.490
What? What does she want?

08:22.710 --> 08:24.450
- Where are they?
- They?

08:25.080 --> 08:26.456
No. Come on.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.875
It's just a couple of fries.

08:29.090 --> 08:30.910
Harvey, just stop.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.045
You know I'm right.

08:35.470 --> 08:37.006
Candy needs to talk to you.

08:41.930 --> 08:43.682
- Candy.
- Harvey.

08:45.190 --> 08:46.509
I'm not doing this anymore.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.225
- Doing what?
- Doing this.

08:48.320 --> 08:51.062
Priests, nuns, rabbis.

08:51.780 --> 08:54.192
- You're religious now?
- No, it just offends me.

08:54.530 --> 08:56.612
Well, I stayed up all night
writing this scene. Ask Joss.

08:56.700 --> 08:59.658
Come on, Harvey,
this whole script is shit.

09:00.660 --> 09:03.538
Hey. Hey, I'm trying to say something

09:03.620 --> 09:05.576
about organized religion
in this movie.

09:05.670 --> 09:08.127
- It's a statement piece.
- Yeah? Saying what, exactly?

09:09.300 --> 09:12.258
Hey, you hear the one
about the blind guy at the seder?

09:12.630 --> 09:15.884
They hand him a piece of matzah,
he says, "Who wrote this shit?"

09:15.970 --> 09:17.346
Harvey,
you gotta get rid of Melinda.

09:17.430 --> 09:19.807
She's fucked up
even when she's not fucked up.

09:19.890 --> 09:21.596
No problem. Anything else?

09:23.020 --> 09:24.055
Yeah.

09:25.770 --> 09:28.557
I'm not doing any more
Daddy Knows Best scenes.

09:28.650 --> 09:29.685
That's a fantasy.

09:29.770 --> 09:30.976
That's not my fantasy.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.640
Oh, that's someone's fantasy.

09:32.780 --> 09:36.102
Hey, Harvey, you want me
to keep banging out films for you,

09:36.860 --> 09:38.942
you gotta give me
some better shit to work with.

09:39.030 --> 09:42.033
And you have gotta let me
start drawing some lines for myself.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.031
- Otherwise...
- All right. Absolutely.

09:47.250 --> 09:49.878
I've also been thinking
about something else.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.879
I want 20, 25 tables
and a small stage.

09:54.420 --> 09:55.580
So, live music?

09:56.010 --> 09:57.420
Yeah, but mellow.

09:57.550 --> 09:59.711
American songbook.
Like at The Carlyle.

10:00.010 --> 10:01.557
So, that means a dance floor.

10:01.720 --> 10:02.926
Maybe a little one.

10:03.180 --> 10:04.590
Nothing anybody'd go crazy on.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.807
There's enough discos
downtown already.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.517
This is more one of those
Nick and Nora Charles nightclubs

10:09.610 --> 10:10.679
from the movies, you know?

10:10.770 --> 10:12.931
Some wit and class to it.

10:13.030 --> 10:15.396
More conversation, less cock.

10:15.650 --> 10:16.810
Something like that.

10:17.070 --> 10:18.981
Been to your other club a few times.

10:19.280 --> 10:22.022
- Did you have fun?
- I did.

10:22.580 --> 10:23.615
Good.

10:23.700 --> 10:26.112
Be that as it may,
I'll need 20,000 up front.

10:26.210 --> 10:28.451
Like I told Kenneth, 15 as a deposit,

10:28.540 --> 10:30.576
five for two months' rent in advance.

10:31.710 --> 10:34.508
Well, we have to talk to some people.
Can we get a little time on this?

10:34.880 --> 10:36.165
Whatever you need.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.131
This isn't it.

10:48.100 --> 10:50.432
they cost more
and they're better than ours.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.319
So how about getting
the fuck out of this shoebox

10:54.150 --> 10:55.890
and making something really special?

10:55.990 --> 10:59.448
Because this crap
that we're doing now, I mean,

10:59.910 --> 11:03.073
I will be amazed
if the guys sitting in the theater

11:03.160 --> 11:05.367
stay to the end of the movie
after they squeeze one out.

11:06.410 --> 11:09.038
And the best flicks,
they make you think a little,

11:09.120 --> 11:10.826
they make you laugh for real.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.911
- Because they give you story.
- Yeah, we give story.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.003
No. The real moneymakers,
Alice in Wonderland.

11:16.090 --> 11:19.002
Right, it's fucking based on
Alice in Wonderland.

11:19.090 --> 11:21.251
Misty Beethoven ’5
based on
My Fair Lady.

11:21.340 --> 11:22.716
Shaw’s
Pygma/ion,
actually.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.802
De W in M/ss Jones
is based on a French play.

11:24.890 --> 11:27.176
- That would be Sa/tre’s
No But.
- Will you stop, please?

11:27.270 --> 11:28.760
But, you know,
it's a bit of a stretch.

11:28.850 --> 11:31.057
Don't do this smart-ass
film buff thing of yours.

11:31.150 --> 11:32.390
I'm just trying to talk to you.

11:32.480 --> 11:35.608
I'm just trying to talk to you.
I'm listening to you.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.771
And I'm not going to those
fucking spaghetti benders

11:38.860 --> 11:40.646
I have to deal with for more money.

11:44.530 --> 11:46.578
- What?
- You heard me.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.701
Et tu,
Mrs. Brute?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.069
Okay.

11:53.210 --> 11:54.916
- I'll raise it on my own.
- Yeah?

11:55.460 --> 11:56.449
Good luck with that.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.291
What now?

12:03.340 --> 12:05.092
- Well done.
- Fucking awesome!

12:05.180 --> 12:06.966
- Nice job, Lori.
- All right, Lori.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.096
- What happened?
- I got nominated!

12:09.640 --> 12:11.722
- For what?
- Best Supporting Actress.

12:11.810 --> 12:13.346
- Hey.
- That's fantastic.

12:13.560 --> 12:15.516
- Which movie?
- Fam/ly Heao’.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.817
- I'm dreaming, right?
- That's amazing.

12:17.900 --> 12:19.527
Taught her everything she knows.

12:19.780 --> 12:22.522
Oh, please. I got off that bus
with skills, and you know it.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.611
- Too true, Lor, too true.
- Hey, Harvey.

12:24.700 --> 12:27.328
- Whose side are you on?
- Harvey. Best Director.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.611
- Get the fuck out.
- Let me see this.

12:33.370 --> 12:34.997
Oh, my...

12:36.460 --> 12:37.540
Fuck.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.210
Nobody's saying nothing about it.

12:43.300 --> 12:45.962
Any of your friends out there
been acting any different than usual?

12:46.050 --> 12:47.176
Like how?

12:48.220 --> 12:51.428
You mean, like, paranoid?
Yeah. Everybody. Every day.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.090
You'd be too if you was one of us.

12:53.890 --> 12:55.721
Who ain't been around since then?

12:56.110 --> 12:57.099
I don't know.

12:59.440 --> 13:00.930
There's this one kid,

13:01.650 --> 13:04.699
kind of like a joker,
always cracking everybody up.

13:05.280 --> 13:06.736
That's why I'm thinking about him.

13:06.820 --> 13:09.197
He kind of disappeared.
But I don't know his name.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.326
Maybe Skeef? Skaff?

13:11.500 --> 13:13.286
White, black or Puerto Rican?

13:14.040 --> 13:16.122
There's something
you need to know about me.

13:18.340 --> 13:21.753
I do what I gotta do, you know,
but I got a girlfriend, too.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.580
Mmm-hmm.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.830
You knew the Doomsday
Defense was gonna show up,

13:26.930 --> 13:28.545
but Jesus, eight turnovers?

13:28.760 --> 13:31.263
It's embarrassing.
Morton got his ass handed to him.

13:31.430 --> 13:32.886
So much for vindication.

13:34.350 --> 13:35.760
How's
you
r
case goi
ng?

13:36.190 --> 13:37.896
You know, zeroing in, zeroing out.

13:38.980 --> 13:41.528
You don't have to feel guilty anymore
about not taking me under your roof.

13:41.610 --> 13:43.396
I wasn't feeling guilty about it.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.526
I'm back with the wife.

13:45.740 --> 13:46.775
Is that a good thing?

13:46.860 --> 13:49.909
My new philosophy, every choice
you can make in life sucks.

13:49.990 --> 13:52.197
Given that, best thing you can do

13:52.290 --> 13:54.326
is choose the thing
that sucks the least.

13:59.630 --> 14:00.836
Over there.

14:11.970 --> 14:13.517
Taylor... Tyler.

14:13.720 --> 14:17.645
Raise her hips up about six inches,
otherwise I can't see the insert.

14:17.770 --> 14:20.056
He does that, he's gonna be
banging on my eggs.

14:20.150 --> 14:22.857
- I don't want to hurt her.
- Hey, Shana, fucking Da Vinci

14:22.940 --> 14:25.682
had to lay on his back for 10 years
with paint dripping in his eyes.

14:25.780 --> 14:28.487
But guess what?
It's called the Sistine Chapel.

14:28.610 --> 14:30.566
Sacrifice for your art, okay?

14:30.950 --> 14:33.612
Randall, a word, please.

14:34.160 --> 14:36.572
Cut. Find me another
fucking angle that works, please.

14:36.660 --> 14:39.788
I know you think you're an artiste,
but this is not a church.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.245
The woman just said
she's not comfortable...

14:41.340 --> 14:43.547
All right, all right, all right.
I hear you.

14:47.260 --> 14:50.502
So, what was so important
you couldn't make today's call?

14:51.510 --> 14:52.499
She's here now. What?

14:52.600 --> 14:54.670
And she was _over _
at Harvey's shop this morning.

14:54.770 --> 14:57.011
Word gets around, Lori.
You double-booked yourself.

14:57.100 --> 14:58.761
- She's in demand.
- Look, it's my fault.

14:58.850 --> 15:01.057
I told you both that I could,
and I didn't realize.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.811
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.310
Go suit up, Miss In Demand.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.520
Who are you?

15:09.910 --> 15:12.310
The agency sent me.
I auditioned today.

15:15.910 --> 15:17.866
Okay. We'll use you in the orgy.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.827
Go talk to her, with the clipboard.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.581
She'll run you through
hair and wardrobe.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.080
Come on.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.629
Lori.

15:35.010 --> 15:36.090
Yeah.

15:36.890 --> 15:38.926
Don't be apologizing for who you are.

15:39.020 --> 15:41.932
See, girl, we just keep moving up.

15:43.110 --> 15:46.147
- And with this award...
- It's just a nomination, C.C.

15:48.570 --> 15:49.696
Mmm-hmm.

15:50.570 --> 15:51.650
You gonna win, girl.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.412
- Miss me already, huh?
- Hey, Abby.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.336
So, why was I summoned?

16:09.760 --> 16:11.000
What's the deal?

16:11.430 --> 16:12.749
You're throwing away sevens!

16:12.890 --> 16:15.848
- Hey, Mike. You're in charge tonight.
- What?

16:15.930 --> 16:18.558
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Vince. Him? Come on.

16:18.640 --> 16:21.848
Did I say Mike was in charge?
Yeah, I think I did.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.726
- What the fuck?
- Where are we going?

16:23.810 --> 16:25.266
Road trip. Tonight.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.186
- What about The Hi-Hat?
- Yeah, what about The Hi-Hat?

16:28.440 --> 16:30.601
I called Annette.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.237
She's gonna come in and cover for you.

16:32.320 --> 16:35.153
Boss man, I don't think I was angling
for any kind of promotion.

16:35.240 --> 16:37.822
Yeah. Beside the fact
that you're crossmg lines here.

16:37.910 --> 16:39.366
I mean, I'm fucking blood, right?

16:39.450 --> 16:42.283
Mike, you're gonna be fine.
You know why? 'Cause I trust you.

16:42.370 --> 16:44.952
Fuck this. Fuck this fucking game.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.916
My grandma plays gin.

16:47.420 --> 16:49.376
Come on, let's go.
I got a rental outside,

16:49.460 --> 16:51.212
you bring your camera if you want.

16:51.300 --> 16:53.336
Mike, gonna be fucking great.

16:56.680 --> 16:57.965
Good luck.

17:02.810 --> 17:05.017
Can I ask you something?

17:08.270 --> 17:09.476
Sure.

17:11.070 --> 17:15.814
There's this girl, Frances Matarazzo,
in my homeroom.

17:16.200 --> 17:20.193
I really like her,
and I think she really likes me.

17:20.290 --> 17:22.781
- Okay.
- But my best friend Stan,

17:22.870 --> 17:24.451
he really likes her.

17:24.750 --> 17:27.708
So, I want to ask her
to go to the movies,

17:27.790 --> 17:29.496
but I don't wanna
make Stan feel crappy.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.751
And I don't want him
to get pissed off at me

17:31.840 --> 17:33.080
and not be my friend anymore.

17:33.170 --> 17:34.967
Yeah, it sounds like a problem.

17:35.260 --> 17:37.751
I mean, Mom,
Frances doesn't even like him.

17:37.930 --> 17:40.387
If you were me, what would you do?

17:45.350 --> 17:46.430
I don't know.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.397
I mean, girls are gonna come and go.

17:48.480 --> 17:51.722
Mom, I really, really like her.

17:52.440 --> 17:54.317
Then I would ask myself

17:54.990 --> 17:57.561
which was more important to me.

17:59.530 --> 18:01.441
The friendship or the movie date.

18:02.620 --> 18:04.451
So, you're going out with girls now?

18:05.040 --> 18:06.166
Just a few.

18:06.250 --> 18:08.036
As opposed to every girl in the world?

18:08.130 --> 18:09.495
Stop, okay?

18:11.590 --> 18:14.252
You know, I've been doing
pretty good at work lately.

18:14.340 --> 18:16.672
What do you think about me
looking around for a two-bedroom?

18:17.300 --> 18:18.289
Okay.

18:18.930 --> 18:20.045
Like, for us.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.845
Not a good idea?

18:25.060 --> 18:26.630
We can look together.

18:27.900 --> 18:28.935
Yeah.

18:30.560 --> 18:33.563
I don't mean right away, but soon.

18:33.860 --> 18:35.816
- How soon?
- Soon.

18:45.700 --> 18:46.826
Here we are.

18:53.210 --> 18:54.370
Wow.

18:54.460 --> 18:55.620
Come on.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.848
Yeah, it don't look like much now,

19:03.260 --> 19:05.091
but you should've seen it
when I was a kid.

19:06.850 --> 19:08.806
- Jesus.
- What?

19:09.480 --> 19:11.892
Condom graveyard down there.

19:12.310 --> 19:14.312
The Coney Island whitefish.

19:15.570 --> 19:17.777
Yeah, summertime,
there'd be couples down there

19:17.860 --> 19:20.943
doing everything from making out
to straight fucking.

19:21.530 --> 19:23.862
My friends and I,
we'd be up here peering down,

19:24.160 --> 19:26.537
we'd see a couple people humping away,

19:26.830 --> 19:28.457
we'd pour water on them
through the slats

19:28.580 --> 19:29.569
and then run like hell.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.456
Pure class.

19:32.210 --> 19:33.620
Lots of babies being made.

19:33.710 --> 19:36.759
Lots of kids running around Brooklyn
with the name Sandy.

19:41.130 --> 19:43.462
Did you ever take
any girls down there?

19:43.850 --> 19:46.592
Once. Marie Amalfitano.

19:47.220 --> 19:50.883
But we were in, like, sixth grade,
so it was mostly kissing.

19:50.980 --> 19:52.049
Mmm.

19:53.480 --> 19:55.516
For me, it was always The Boathouse.

19:56.530 --> 19:57.986
My parents' club.

19:59.860 --> 20:03.819
Well, welcome to the great state
of Un-Connecticut.

20:06.160 --> 20:08.822
I think I would have had
a lot more fun here.

20:11.040 --> 20:14.168
Yeah, I heard
she's a dental hygienist now.

20:14.670 --> 20:15.659
VVho?

20:16.670 --> 20:19.252
Marie Amalfitano.

20:22.010 --> 20:25.138
Saw you also got one
of the AFAA nominations.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.301
You, too?

20:28.220 --> 20:29.517
What was yours for?

20:30.730 --> 20:31.970
Best Actress.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.600
Oh.

20:35.230 --> 20:36.857
Just Supporting, me.

20:37.730 --> 20:39.220
It's all cake, right?

20:39.320 --> 20:40.560
Mmm-hmm.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.521
- You see me on TV last night?
- Mmm-mmm.

20:44.820 --> 20:46.060
Midnight Blue.

20:46.740 --> 20:48.230
That Channel J show.

20:48.620 --> 20:50.190
With the
Screw
guy, Al.

20:51.120 --> 20:52.951
That Channel 35 show?
Yeah, I've seen that.

20:53.040 --> 20:54.166
Uh-huh.

20:54.250 --> 20:56.286
He interviews you
just like Johnny Carson,

20:56.380 --> 21:00.453
except he's asking you,
like, about fucking and sucking.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.079
You should go on with him.

21:03.180 --> 21:04.829
Millions of guys watch,

21:05.430 --> 21:07.386
and you don't have to do much.

21:08.510 --> 21:11.843
- He just asked you to go on it?
- Nope. Kiki set it up.

21:16.940 --> 21:18.430
She's your manager?

21:18.860 --> 21:21.067
Manager, agent,
whatever she wants to call herself.

21:24.780 --> 21:25.986
Do you wanna meet her?

21:27.740 --> 21:29.446
Uh, maybe another time.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.321
So, anyway, after we taped the show,

21:35.420 --> 21:37.536
the guy, Al,
he invites me back to his office,

21:38.000 --> 21:40.377
and I'm thinking,
"Okay, here it comes.

21:41.050 --> 21:42.870
"Now I gotta blow him
or whatever for the spot."

21:42.970 --> 21:44.039
Mmm-hmm.

21:44.130 --> 21:47.179
But really, he just asks
if he can go down on me.

21:48.260 --> 21:51.138
Just asks it,
like I have to give permission.

21:51.350 --> 21:52.339
What?

21:53.350 --> 21:56.899
And then, afterwards,
he gives me half of his sandwich

21:56.980 --> 21:59.471
and we talk about
how he can't get his favorite deli

21:59.560 --> 22:01.687
to deliver below 23rd Street.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.106
I mean, whatever, right?

22:09.200 --> 22:10.485
- What the hell?
- All right, stand aside.

22:10.580 --> 22:13.697
Look, there's an art to this,
all right?

22:23.130 --> 22:24.370
Oh!

22:26.470 --> 22:29.883
Just 'cause it looks easy
don't mean that it is.

22:29.970 --> 22:31.801
- Oh. Hmm.
- Yeah.

22:31.890 --> 22:32.925
Right?

22:34.020 --> 22:35.806
All right. Here's the secret.

22:36.270 --> 22:37.339
You gotta bank it.

22:38.100 --> 22:39.431
- Watch.
- Okay.

22:42.900 --> 22:43.969
Huh?

22:44.070 --> 22:45.185
Okay?

22:45.650 --> 22:48.153
No, sorry, it says "no bank shots."

22:50.120 --> 22:51.826
Yeah. Exactly.

22:55.620 --> 22:56.746
Come on.

22:57.580 --> 22:59.787
- Here we go. Here we go.
- All right.

23:04.880 --> 23:07.462
Stick with me, kid.
I'll show you the world, huh?

23:10.680 --> 23:13.422
Give me my hand back!

23:13.890 --> 23:15.209
Fuck you!

23:20.350 --> 23:21.396
Let me go!

23:21.520 --> 23:24.318
Just a dollar minimum
Is all it takes to smell it;

23:24.400 --> 23:26.561
touch it; taste it; n'ght now.

23:26.650 --> 23:28.641
- Damn it!
- Fuck you!

23:29.950 --> 23:31.941
Give me my goddamn hand back!

23:32.030 --> 23:33.657
- Fuck you, asshole!
- Hey, you all right?

23:33.740 --> 23:35.617
- Get me out of here!
- Elise, lift it up!

23:35.700 --> 23:37.861
- Fuck you too, Frankie!
- All right.

23:38.040 --> 23:39.405
- You have to help me.
- All right, relax.

23:39.500 --> 23:40.865
- Where you going?
- Relax.

23:42.960 --> 23:44.029
Whoa, sorry.

23:44.380 --> 23:47.622
The best pussy
in New York City, r/ght here.

23:49.550 --> 23:52.508
Hey, Elise. Hey.
The button. Push the button!

23:52.590 --> 23:53.921
See what he fucking did to me?

23:54.010 --> 23:55.500
All right, he's got long fingernails.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.215
What, you gonna
chop his fucking arm off?

23:57.310 --> 23:58.550
You fucking serious, Frankie?

23:58.640 --> 24:00.096
Push the fucking button!

24:00.190 --> 24:02.010
- Fucking asshole.
- Push the button!

24:02.100 --> 24:04.227
Push the... Push the fucking button!

24:04.980 --> 24:07.312
- Push it!
- I am! It's fucking broken!

24:09.320 --> 24:12.983
Fuck. All right. Sir, just wait there.

24:14.450 --> 24:15.485
You bitch!

24:15.580 --> 24:16.729
- All right, relax.
- Open...

24:16.830 --> 24:19.697
- Will you get me out of here?
- Relax! Relax! Relax!

24:19.790 --> 24:21.075
- All right, easy.
- Get it open!

24:21.160 --> 24:22.707
- There you go.
- Shit!

24:22.790 --> 24:24.451
Look what she did to me.

24:25.420 --> 24:26.910
- My watch! Where's my watch?
- What...

24:27.000 --> 24:27.989
She took my watch!

24:28.090 --> 24:29.205
- Elise!
- The bitch took my watch.

24:29.300 --> 24:30.540
The watch!

24:30.630 --> 24:32.177
- Fuck! Fuck!
- There it is.

24:32.260 --> 24:34.137
Girl, girls, girls!

24:34.760 --> 24:36.136
I'm going to the cops! Right now!

24:36.220 --> 24:39.098
Well, could've been worse, you know.
She could've taken the wedding ring.

24:39.520 --> 24:40.589
Oh, fuck you.

24:41.770 --> 24:42.930
All right.

24:43.730 --> 24:45.106
Elise, you okay in there?

24:45.190 --> 24:46.600
Fuck you, Frankie.

24:46.820 --> 24:48.060
You all right, baby?

24:55.870 --> 24:57.269
No, I will not be paying my tab.

24:57.370 --> 24:58.610
Did I say anything?

24:58.700 --> 25:00.577
But if things go good Thursday,
I might be.

25:00.660 --> 25:02.958
- What's Thursday?
- A legit callback.

25:03.750 --> 25:05.206
Fantastic. For what?

25:05.290 --> 25:06.996
A revival of
The Zoo Story.

25:07.090 --> 25:09.911
It's in New Hope, Pennsylvania,
but right now I'll go anywhere.

25:10.010 --> 25:11.159
I thought you were busy.

25:11.260 --> 25:14.172
Yeah, just some porn.
I'm trying not to do so much of that.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.671
Three years Juilliard,
two years La MaMa,

25:17.760 --> 25:20.513
and it's like I got a brand
on my forehead from that shit.

25:22.480 --> 25:23.879
Every casting agent in town

25:23.980 --> 25:25.845
is whispering something
about the size of my dick

25:25.940 --> 25:27.510
before I walk in for any read.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.851
Well, as long as they say nice things.

25:32.440 --> 25:35.443
- To New Hope.
- To any hope at all.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.621
- Welcome to Neponsit.
- Whose house is this?

25:54.170 --> 25:55.330
My Aunt Celeste.

25:55.760 --> 25:58.001
She's upstate visiting her daughter.

25:58.090 --> 25:59.967
Mmm.

26:02.850 --> 26:04.226
- Yeah.
- Wow!

26:05.770 --> 26:08.648
Where is Miss Havisham's wedding cake?

26:09.310 --> 26:10.891
What do you mean? Still hungry?

26:14.400 --> 26:15.480
What?

26:20.080 --> 26:21.149
Yeah.

26:21.740 --> 26:22.900
Big family.

26:30.630 --> 26:31.790
Mmm.

26:33.050 --> 26:35.541
You were so adorable as a little kid.

26:35.670 --> 26:38.389
Yeah, I think you're looking
at Frankie there.

26:38.510 --> 26:39.670
No, I'm not.

26:43.470 --> 26:45.882
Shit, you're right. That is me.

26:56.320 --> 26:57.890
Gene, you need anything?

26:57.990 --> 26:59.309
I'm fine, Paul.

26:59.610 --> 27:01.316
Can I have one more
of the same thing?

27:01.570 --> 27:02.821
Let me get you a real drink.

27:02.910 --> 27:04.036
Okay.

27:10.460 --> 27:11.529
Hey, settle down.

27:19.840 --> 27:22.138
- He's the one that hit me first.
- I never touched you.

27:22.220 --> 27:23.255
- Step back!
- Faggot!

27:24.350 --> 27:26.466
It's me. It's me. You okay?

27:27.180 --> 27:28.477
I'm fine.

27:28.560 --> 27:29.686
You fucking cowards.

27:29.770 --> 27:31.761
- "You fucking cowards."
- What'd he hit you with?

27:31.860 --> 27:33.430
I don't know.
I was coming out of the bar

27:33.520 --> 27:35.818
- and I got hit from behind.
- So, he hit you with his fist?

27:35.900 --> 27:37.310
Officer, it's dark in there.

27:37.400 --> 27:38.446
Maybe he was trying to fit

27:38.530 --> 27:39.895
a big black cock in his mouth
and he missed!

27:39.990 --> 27:42.117
- Hey, no one's talking to you!
- Lean back, guys. Lean back.

27:42.200 --> 27:43.827
How do you know it was him
if he hit you from behind?

27:43.910 --> 27:45.650
- I know because...
- You know why?

27:45.740 --> 27:48.197
’Cause
mancns,
they like it from behind.

27:48.290 --> 27:49.496
Hey, what'd I just say to you?

27:49.580 --> 27:51.036
Listen,
you want to file a complaint?

27:51.120 --> 27:53.782
Or can we just take you to the ER
and call it a night?

27:59.420 --> 28:01.547
Dee, do up the top button.

28:02.930 --> 28:06.093
Yeah, I think it's hotter like that
if you slowly take them off.

28:06.470 --> 28:07.516
Let's do the talking again.

28:07.600 --> 28:10.478
I hate to evict you.

28:10.560 --> 28:13.142
Nice and slow. You're in charge.

28:13.230 --> 28:15.357
- It's almost midnight.
- Maybe we can work something out.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.389
How?

28:20.110 --> 28:22.271
Let's think, see what pops up.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.907
He owes you money. Enjoy your power.

28:31.460 --> 28:34.452
Yeah. That's a week's rent
paid up right there.

28:35.090 --> 28:37.411
Okay, Terry,
give me a little resistance.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.081
This is a strange situation.

28:39.260 --> 28:42.002
- Why would I resist?
- Because you're not in charge here.

28:42.340 --> 28:44.717
- Like I'm kind of the girl here?
- Don't look at me. Look at her.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.176
Yeah, Terry, you kind of are.

28:46.260 --> 28:47.670
Candy, how much rent does he owe me?

28:47.760 --> 28:49.307
I'm not loving the color of that sofa.

28:49.390 --> 28:51.472
Fuck me! Guys. Fuck!

28:51.980 --> 28:53.550
Cut. Cut.

29:01.280 --> 29:02.645
Okay, I'm sorry.

29:03.240 --> 29:05.117
I know everybody's tired,

29:05.370 --> 29:08.988
but we have gotta get these scenes
by the morning, all right?

29:09.080 --> 29:11.287
We're already a day overdue
on the camera.

29:11.370 --> 29:12.610
Can we reset?

29:14.370 --> 29:15.997
Let's get to the fucking.

29:39.480 --> 29:40.890
Jesus Christ.

29:44.240 --> 29:47.312
Look who's home, Jeremy.
It's your fucking dada.

29:48.240 --> 29:51.448
- Can I just breathe here?
- Here, breathe with him.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.070
He's been crying all day.
I'm exhausted.

29:56.170 --> 29:58.035
Did you take him to the pediatrician?

29:58.840 --> 30:00.205
This morning.

30:00.300 --> 30:01.915
He wants to test him for allergies.

30:02.010 --> 30:04.217
- What allergies?
- All.

30:06.630 --> 30:08.257
I'm gonna go back to bed.

30:08.340 --> 30:09.796
Don't fall asleep on me, okay?

30:09.890 --> 30:10.959
Too late.

30:14.140 --> 30:15.437
You okay there, buddy?

30:22.900 --> 30:24.140
Candy.

30:25.200 --> 30:27.566
I wanna rap to you about something.

30:29.370 --> 30:31.770
Hey, baby.
Just give us a second, all right?

30:33.580 --> 30:34.820
Thanks, Dee.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.825
Look, I've been
coming down here awhile

30:37.920 --> 30:40.127
to see what you do, how you do.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.245
And I gotta say,

30:43.050 --> 30:44.950
the males you use,

30:45.470 --> 30:47.256
they don't look like real men.

30:48.550 --> 30:50.347
They don't even fuck like real men.

30:50.760 --> 30:52.091
Yeah, no kidding.

30:54.220 --> 30:56.302
How come you hardly use any brothers?

30:56.810 --> 30:58.550
Where we going with this, Larry?

31:09.610 --> 31:10.770
Are you serious?

31:11.660 --> 31:12.729
Why not?

31:13.450 --> 31:15.156
I mean, a pimp is a performer, right?

31:15.750 --> 31:17.035
I perform every day.

31:17.120 --> 31:19.827
And depending who I gotta deal with,
it's a different role.

31:20.330 --> 31:23.458
Hoes, cops, other pimps.

31:23.750 --> 31:27.413
I am who I need to be
to control the situation.

31:27.510 --> 31:31.469
Yeah, but that's the thing.
Guys like you, it's all about control.

31:32.390 --> 31:35.268
That shit don't play here.
You gotta give all that up.

31:35.350 --> 31:37.807
Show your ass, do what you're told.

31:40.190 --> 31:42.306
Think you could do that, Larry?

31:44.020 --> 31:45.976
I can do whatever I put my mind to.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.356
Can't bitch-slap a camera.

32:15.600 --> 32:16.840
Long day's night.

32:19.430 --> 32:20.510
Thank you.

32:34.070 --> 32:36.698
Hey, who was that lady
you were talking to today?

32:36.780 --> 32:38.281
You mean Genevieve Furie?

32:38.370 --> 32:39.496
No.

32:40.410 --> 32:42.822
The fuck!
Harvey, you don't give me a heads-up?

32:42.920 --> 32:44.319
I didn't wanna make you nervous.

32:44.420 --> 32:46.627
Oh, for Christ's sake.

32:50.210 --> 32:51.711
Did she say anything?

32:51.880 --> 32:53.461
You wanna meet her?

33:13.820 --> 33:15.230
You know who that is, right?

33:15.320 --> 33:17.276
I know he need to get a new wig.

33:21.080 --> 33:23.287
Yo, yo, yo! Listen up!

33:24.120 --> 33:25.781
Turn the music down for this.

33:26.250 --> 33:27.626
Turn it down!

33:29.840 --> 33:31.796
It's 4:00 am, and all y'all know

33:31.880 --> 33:34.929
this the moment where my man Vincent
kick this party up a notch

33:35.010 --> 33:37.467
by making sure everybody
have a free drink in their hand.

33:39.010 --> 33:40.136
That's right,

33:40.220 --> 33:42.632
4:00 am,
and y'all sipping on a new one.

33:43.730 --> 33:46.392
But I ain't Vincent.
Do I even look Italian?

33:46.770 --> 33:48.897
In fact, I don't look anything
like a motherfucker

33:48.980 --> 33:51.813
who needs to give a free drink
to anyone, ever.

33:52.110 --> 33:53.941
So, if y'all wanna
keep this party happening,

33:54.030 --> 33:55.406
y'all gonna get to the bar,

33:55.490 --> 33:57.560
put down some cash money
on some alcohol,

33:57.660 --> 34:01.198
or I'm gonna bounce your ass
into the cold light of the early morn.

34:02.750 --> 34:04.320
Mike, you're honorary Italian!

34:04.410 --> 34:06.071
Hey, forget about it.

34:06.540 --> 34:08.076
Paisans, let's drink!

34:18.140 --> 34:19.880
That girl today on set?

34:20.010 --> 34:21.420
Uh-huh?

34:22.010 --> 34:23.807
She just sashays in,

34:24.140 --> 34:26.347
says she wants
to make a movie with us.

34:26.810 --> 34:30.974
And she's like some college girl
from, like, wherever.

34:31.980 --> 34:35.029
And that's the thing.
They're all like that now.

34:35.400 --> 34:38.153
Like, everybody that I work with,
all the girls,

34:38.660 --> 34:40.696
never whored, never will.

34:41.620 --> 34:45.659
It's like they just decided
that they want to make porn flicks.

34:46.870 --> 34:49.532
Like they sat down
with their guidance counselors

34:49.630 --> 34:50.745
and made a plan.

34:53.090 --> 34:54.330
Thing is,

34:56.420 --> 35:00.754
everything and everybody,
it's just, it's getting...

35:03.890 --> 35:07.929
I don't know,
it's changed, C.C., you know?

35:09.440 --> 35:12.182
It's not like how it was
when we started.

35:12.900 --> 35:14.140
It's different.

35:15.320 --> 35:19.734
The directors and the actors,
and it's just...

35:22.740 --> 35:24.446
It's like a free world.

35:24.540 --> 35:25.996
A free world.

35:27.370 --> 35:28.746
Yeah.

35:29.960 --> 35:31.746
You know, the awards,

35:32.380 --> 35:33.950
they say that all the nominees

35:34.050 --> 35:36.120
are going out to LA
for the award show.

35:36.590 --> 35:37.966
No kidding.

35:38.050 --> 35:39.506
Like, on a plane?

35:39.590 --> 35:43.879
Yeah. Yeah, they say
it's like a thing, like...

35:45.430 --> 35:46.590
Like a...

35:46.680 --> 35:49.342
Like, an important thing
for the business.

35:50.190 --> 35:52.146
They say everybody's gonna be there.

35:52.560 --> 35:54.767
I don't know, maybe we should go.

36:24.470 --> 36:25.596
Hey.

36:35.570 --> 36:37.891
You going out for the AFAA awards?

36:38.780 --> 36:40.065
I hope so.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.100
I've never been to LA before.

36:43.820 --> 36:46.527
It's a chance to meet and greet
the whole industry, both coasts.

36:47.660 --> 36:48.866
Like who?

36:49.250 --> 36:53.414
De Renzy, Damiano,
Spinelli, Arthur Morowitz,

36:53.710 --> 36:55.120
the Mitchells.

36:55.670 --> 36:57.831
You want, I can arrange sit-downs.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.040
Absolutely.

37:00.340 --> 37:02.422
Then you gotta hire me as your agent.

37:03.050 --> 37:06.213
I get 10% of everything,
no more, no less, no strings.

37:06.680 --> 37:09.387
- Why me?
- Because when I watch you in a flick,

37:09.640 --> 37:13.224
I see a woman who genuinely
looks like she's enjoying herself.

37:14.230 --> 37:16.266
Sometimes I do, but sometimes...

37:16.360 --> 37:18.260
I'm not saying
what you think I'm saying.

37:18.360 --> 37:20.897
I'm saying you're an actor.

37:22.780 --> 37:25.943
Do you know what a gift that is,
to be able to sell it onscreen?

37:26.320 --> 37:28.697
I've never really thought about it,
I just...

37:28.950 --> 37:31.942
Like I was telling Shana,
this whole thing is new for porn,

37:32.040 --> 37:34.918
agents actually
representing the talent.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.661
New on this coast, at least.

37:36.750 --> 37:42.165
Here, the only thing agents did
was find fresh bodies for directors.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.579
We worked for them,

37:43.670 --> 37:47.299
but out West,
girls are starting to get repped.

37:47.680 --> 37:51.844
You let me guide your career,
we're both gonna make a lot of money.

37:56.480 --> 37:58.300
That's what C.C. always says.

38:00.900 --> 38:02.356
The other day on set,

38:02.440 --> 38:04.271
what were you talking
to the director about?

38:04.360 --> 38:07.022
About treating my client with respect,

38:07.570 --> 38:09.822
professional respect.

38:10.120 --> 38:14.079
Look, CC. is a pimp

38:14.210 --> 38:16.451
who's in way over his head,

38:16.540 --> 38:18.997
and the only thing he's gonna do
is drag you down.

38:22.630 --> 38:24.370
In the summers,
my Aunt Celeste,

38:24.470 --> 38:27.337
she'd send all the rug rat cousins
out here to the beach.

38:27.680 --> 38:31.059
She'd sit on the porch
with her sisters, play canasta,

38:31.760 --> 38:34.172
talk about shit you wouldn't believe.

38:34.770 --> 38:37.648
Like, "If you can't marry Italian,
what's the next best choice?"

38:38.060 --> 38:40.358
And me and Frank,
we'd come up from the beach,

38:40.440 --> 38:42.067
too much sand in our shorts.

38:42.360 --> 38:44.180
And our other aunt, Carmen,

38:44.740 --> 38:47.652
she'd give us a taste of her wine
in a paper cup.

38:47.820 --> 38:50.152
And then we'd run back
to the house, to the backyard,

38:50.240 --> 38:52.151
and my Uncle Ernie would be
back there with all the husbands,

38:52.240 --> 38:53.730
he'd give us a taste,

38:53.830 --> 38:56.708
and if he was winning,
he'd let us play a hand for him.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.912
All day, back and forth,
back and forth like that.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.991
So, what is the next best choice?

39:02.460 --> 39:03.836
- For a husband?
-Mmmmmm.

39:03.920 --> 39:05.717
My Aunt Celeste, she liked the Jews.

39:05.800 --> 39:08.086
Jews, they make better money

39:08.180 --> 39:11.001
and generally they don't hit
their wives or beat on their kids.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.550
I love this.

39:17.230 --> 39:19.516
Yeah. It's the best.

39:20.310 --> 39:21.686
This is us.

39:27.360 --> 39:28.566
Shit, we gotta get back.

39:28.650 --> 39:30.060
- Why? What's the rush?
- Fuck.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.559
I almost forgot the baby shower.

39:31.660 --> 39:33.776
What... What baby shower?

39:49.970 --> 39:51.460
I want D80, half a load.

39:51.550 --> 39:53.290
- You have the blood knife?
- Right, yeah.

39:53.390 --> 39:55.881
I wanna see the incision,
you know? That's good.

39:55.970 --> 39:58.427
Use the air cannon
for the splatter on the wall.

39:58.520 --> 39:59.839
- You know what to do.
- Great.

40:00.020 --> 40:02.090
Oren, I think
we're gonna start with, like,

40:02.190 --> 40:04.681
a wide two-shot,
then you dolly in from there

40:04.770 --> 40:06.271
and stay on her face.

40:06.360 --> 40:07.349
- I'll do him.
- Perfect.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.647
Janet, when you're
stabbing him for the first time,

40:09.740 --> 40:11.355
I wanna see rage in your eyes.

40:11.450 --> 40:13.611
- Rage, okay? You're doing great.
- All right.

40:13.700 --> 40:15.486
First position, everybody.
Nobody fuck it up.

40:15.580 --> 40:16.899
I wanna get it in one.

40:17.240 --> 40:18.616
I'm going handheld on this.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.990
- Okay, Oren, are you ready?
- Yeah.

40:21.460 --> 40:22.620
Okay.

40:23.500 --> 40:24.876
Raise it higher.

40:24.960 --> 40:27.121
That's good,
but lift your chin a little.

40:27.210 --> 40:29.087
Okay? You look great. All right.

40:33.390 --> 40:34.755
Where the hell were you?

40:34.850 --> 40:36.306
Don't start, okay?

40:36.390 --> 40:39.518
You were supposed to take Patrick
to the dentist two hours ago!

40:39.850 --> 40:42.512
There was a pile-up on the bridge.
Nothing I could do about it.

40:42.600 --> 40:44.556
He's gonna wind up
with more holes than teeth.

40:45.190 --> 40:47.932
- Here. Take him.
- Not now, Fran.

40:48.030 --> 40:50.100
- I'm supposed to go...
- I said not now!

40:50.190 --> 40:51.487
Bobby!

40:57.280 --> 40:58.656
Miss Furie,
I have gotta tell you...

40:58.740 --> 40:59.946
Agneiszka.

41:01.370 --> 41:03.326
"Genevieve Furie" is just for show.

41:04.330 --> 41:08.915
Agneiszka, I have learned so much
watching the films you directed.

41:09.460 --> 41:11.416
And I have seen all of them,

41:11.510 --> 41:14.547
'cause I know you started
in skin flicks like me. And now...

41:14.640 --> 41:17.552
And now they, you know, let me
do the trash and the slash

41:17.640 --> 41:19.096
and the horror and...

41:19.930 --> 41:22.307
It's still porn, but different.

41:22.770 --> 41:24.806
Well, it's more than fuck films.

41:26.860 --> 41:28.145
Yeah.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.656
So, why did you come to our set?

41:35.820 --> 41:37.230
Harvey asked me.

41:38.030 --> 41:39.327
He likes you.

41:40.290 --> 41:42.030
And we share some history.

41:42.330 --> 41:44.912
So, me, I don't like women, you know?

41:45.000 --> 41:47.457
They talking too much,
they slow things down,

41:47.540 --> 41:50.452
they can't lift track,
they can't move camera, they...

41:53.720 --> 41:54.869
Thank you.

41:57.430 --> 41:59.136
If I was your teacher,

41:59.680 --> 42:01.386
from what I see yesterday,

42:02.270 --> 42:03.635
I'd give you a "C."

42:05.350 --> 42:08.683
First of all, your camera guy,
he think he's your co-director.

42:08.980 --> 42:12.313
Put him in his place,
or fire him and shoot it yourself.

42:12.740 --> 42:14.890
Second of all, your crew is shit.

42:14.990 --> 42:17.311
There's plenty
of legitimate pros out there

42:17.410 --> 42:19.981
who'd be happy to moonlight,
you know, for extra dollars.

42:20.080 --> 42:22.446
Just put the word out
and they find you.

42:23.160 --> 42:26.994
Third of all, anyone can fuck on film,

42:27.790 --> 42:29.621
but hardly anyone can act.

42:29.920 --> 42:32.627
- Yeah.
- To me, I'd rather use real actor

42:32.710 --> 42:34.507
- with normal-sized prick.
- Yeah.

42:34.590 --> 42:37.218
Because what happen when they
actually have to stop fucking?

42:37.300 --> 42:38.961
- When they have to open their mouth...
- Exactly.

42:39.050 --> 42:40.847
- ...and sell a character? Right?
- Yeah.

42:41.760 --> 42:44.923
Four, stop using whores.

42:46.560 --> 42:48.471
They're dead around the eyes.

42:57.700 --> 43:00.112
Got some bubbly for the ladies!

43:02.700 --> 43:03.860
Thank you!

43:04.080 --> 43:05.286
Ah!

43:11.710 --> 43:13.746
- You're sure it's a girl, right?
- Yeah.

43:17.800 --> 43:19.119
In case the damn doctor's wrong.

43:21.430 --> 43:22.749
Yo, come on!

43:22.850 --> 43:25.057
You have_ customers out here
freezrng our nuts off!

43:25.140 --> 43:26.971
- Come on!
- Big bad wolf.

43:34.530 --> 43:35.519
All right.

43:35.940 --> 43:38.898
Raise a glass for Adam or Eve.

43:49.750 --> 43:51.706
We ain't here for no al fresco shit.

43:51.790 --> 43:55.453
Guys, it's a baby shower.
A girl thing.

43:56.760 --> 43:58.330
Let them have their party.

43:59.300 --> 44:00.585
Hey, Daddy.

44:03.100 --> 44:04.465
What's going on in there?

44:04.560 --> 44:05.675
I just said.

44:06.680 --> 44:08.591
Bought a motherfucking present
for the bitch.

44:09.350 --> 44:10.590
Oh, that's sweet.

44:11.560 --> 44:14.188
If it's so girly-girly,
why the fuck Vince in there?

44:29.370 --> 44:32.362
Do me a favor. There's a tribe
of slap-a-hoes out there.

44:32.460 --> 44:34.587
Can you go babysit them
before they break the door down?

44:38.710 --> 44:41.588
Hey, yo, see that bodega
up on 9th burned down, too?

44:41.760 --> 44:43.637
That why they call it Hell's Kitchen?

44:43.720 --> 44:45.790
Hey, I got cigars.

44:46.930 --> 44:48.136
My man.

44:48.350 --> 44:50.420
You know what
they're doing inside, right?

44:50.810 --> 44:52.016
What do you think they're doing?

44:52.190 --> 44:54.146
- They're conniving against our asses.
- Yeah.

44:54.810 --> 44:57.392
Scratch a bitch, uncover a conspiracy.

44:58.110 --> 44:59.680
Yeah...

45:05.910 --> 45:08.447
Okay,
a cucumber won't knock you up.

45:08.540 --> 45:10.906
A cucumber won't beat your ass.

45:11.250 --> 45:12.956
Or say, "It ain't mine."

45:13.670 --> 45:15.126
A cucumber won't give you the syph.

45:15.210 --> 45:17.667
- Or hate on your kids.
- Or take your money.

45:17.750 --> 45:19.957
- Or beat your ass.
- You said that already.

45:20.050 --> 45:21.415
I'm saying it again.

45:22.970 --> 45:25.256
Did somebody say soft?
It won't go soft?

45:25.340 --> 45:26.466
Yeah.

45:26.680 --> 45:27.965
Wait, which one?

45:33.810 --> 45:35.641
Sorry I got you kicked out of there.

45:36.190 --> 45:38.761
Yeah, they didn't
want me in there anyway.

45:41.650 --> 45:42.981
Getting cold.

45:49.950 --> 45:53.863
It's all about Roger Staubach
and his Doomsday Defense...

45:55.830 --> 45:57.491
Dropping off or picking up?

45:58.130 --> 45:59.336
What do you care?

45:59.920 --> 46:01.126
Question withdrawn.

46:01.460 --> 46:03.121
Fuck you. People have to eat.

46:06.220 --> 46:07.926
So, how goes your tourist carving?

46:10.260 --> 46:12.012
I keep hearing about
this one hustler kid

46:12.100 --> 46:13.670
who disappeared right after.

46:14.520 --> 46:16.590
- Skeef, Skiff...
- You mean Skeets.

46:16.810 --> 46:19.051
- Skeets?
- Angel Arroyo.

46:19.150 --> 46:21.687
If he's vanished,
he didn't vanish far.

46:21.820 --> 46:23.139
His mother lives up in the Bronx.

46:24.070 --> 46:25.981
This here is called

46:26.990 --> 46:28.696
getting some work out of me.

46:31.160 --> 46:34.118
Cowboys gonna do it again
next year. Just wait.

46:49.890 --> 46:51.005
Fuck me.

46:51.970 --> 46:54.052
Listen to this. Listen.

46:54.770 --> 46:58.843
"He could be seen from afar
among the trees

46:58.980 --> 47:01.767
"putting his arm around her waist

47:02.110 --> 47:04.681
"and walking, half-bending over,

47:05.280 --> 47:09.353
"ruffling the chemisette
of her bodice with his head."

47:09.450 --> 47:10.565
There's four fucking chapters,

47:10.660 --> 47:13.037
that's the closest
anybody's got to fucking!

47:15.870 --> 47:18.668
Agneiszka said,
"Look to the classics." Fuck.

47:20.040 --> 47:21.120
Moby Dick?

47:21.210 --> 47:22.916
You gonna make a joke
about a sperm whale?

47:23.000 --> 47:24.661
- The Iceman Cometh.
- The what?

47:24.760 --> 47:27.411
Crotch-22?
The Adventures of Fuck/eber/y Finn?

47:27.510 --> 47:29.330
Stop. It's not a fucking party game.

47:33.890 --> 47:35.346
What about fairy tales?

47:36.180 --> 47:38.262
Most of them are about sex, aanay.

47:38.350 --> 47:39.760
Hmm.

47:40.770 --> 47:42.931
- For example?
- Snow White.

47:43.650 --> 47:45.527
You gotta cast dwarves.

47:47.190 --> 47:49.067
Cinderella?
No, no.

47:49.320 --> 47:50.651
Keep going.

47:51.620 --> 47:52.689
Gold/locks.

47:52.780 --> 47:54.862
"Somebody's been sleeping in my bed."

47:56.120 --> 47:57.439
Sleeping Beauty.

48:03.290 --> 48:09.001
Hey, there, Little Red Riding Hood

48:09.720 --> 48:14.464
You sure are looking good

48:15.600 --> 48:17.921
You ’re everything

48:18.020 --> 48:23.185
That a big bad wolf could want

48:37.160 --> 48:38.491
How you doing?

48:39.540 --> 48:40.859
You run this shithole?

48:42.920 --> 48:44.069
I, uh...

48:45.420 --> 48:46.990
- Yep.
- Give me a Dewar's, rocks.

48:47.170 --> 48:49.377
Same for Frick and Frack over here.

48:55.760 --> 48:57.887
Heard about that mess the other night.

49:01.100 --> 49:02.340
Do you know who I am?

49:05.440 --> 49:06.850
- The Horse.
- That's right.

49:09.360 --> 49:10.816
and one around the corner.

49:10.990 --> 49:12.480
Nobody fucks with them, do they?

49:18.790 --> 49:20.109
Mr. Ianniello,

49:20.370 --> 49:22.861
we already have an understanding
with Mr. Pipilo.

49:24.250 --> 49:25.877
Oh, Mr. Pipilo.

49:26.250 --> 49:28.992
Shit. I didn't know
you were with Rudy.

49:29.090 --> 49:32.548
How the fuck am I supposed to know
that you're with a guy

49:32.920 --> 49:35.673
when your customers are getting
the shit beat out of them

49:35.760 --> 49:38.058
every time they go
in and out of your joint?

49:38.510 --> 49:39.841
I came here to help you.

49:39.930 --> 49:41.477
Far be it for me

49:41.560 --> 49:44.768
to interject into
the business affairs of Rudy Pipilo.

49:45.150 --> 49:48.438
But if I were you,
I'd ask out of that arrangement,

49:48.730 --> 49:50.277
and possibly get into a new one,

49:50.610 --> 49:53.317
where you're actually getting
the protection you're paying for.

49:53.610 --> 49:55.737
But that's up to you, not me.

50:12.880 --> 50:15.292
Yo. Hit us again.

50:19.010 --> 50:21.513
He had you backed
against the passenger door.

50:36.030 --> 50:37.270
Let me hear you say it.

50:38.740 --> 50:40.150
Backed against the door, yeah.

50:40.330 --> 50:42.195
So, you had no way to escape him?

50:43.750 --> 50:44.865
No.

50:46.500 --> 50:47.910
And he was angry.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.376
How much do you weigh?

50:52.300 --> 50:54.416
He weighs nothing. Look at him.

50:55.510 --> 50:57.375
Can I tell you how much
the other man weighed?

50:59.260 --> 51:00.670
Two hundred and forty pounds.

51:01.010 --> 51:02.136
Dios mo.

51:03.890 --> 51:05.881
So, would you say
you were in fear for your life?

51:12.690 --> 51:14.021
Yeah.

51:17.740 --> 51:18.900
Good.

51:19.610 --> 51:21.157
So, where were you?

51:21.410 --> 51:23.617
He had me backed up
against the passenger door.

51:25.160 --> 51:27.037
There was nothing else I could do.

51:29.080 --> 51:31.583
- You got it?
- Yeah. That's good.

51:32.170 --> 51:33.580
All right. Watch your head.
Got it?

51:33.670 --> 51:34.659
Yup.

51:40.890 --> 51:42.255
Duggan.

51:44.220 --> 51:47.769
Big Bobby Dwyer. Holy shit.

51:47.890 --> 51:51.053
I haven't seen you
since the Naw Yard job.

51:51.150 --> 51:53.186
What was that, six, seven years ago?

51:53.360 --> 51:55.100
What the fuck's going on here?

51:56.740 --> 51:57.980
What does it look like?

52:00.780 --> 52:02.361
And why do you care?

52:06.870 --> 52:08.280
Detective Alston?

52:11.460 --> 52:13.030
So, you solved it.

52:14.290 --> 52:15.541
You heard quick.

52:16.210 --> 52:17.541
I usually do.

52:18.090 --> 52:19.921
So? Robbery?

52:20.470 --> 52:21.755
Was he robbed?

52:22.220 --> 52:24.757
He_was down on the Deuce
trolling for some young trade,

52:24.850 --> 52:27.887
and he backed the wrong kid into doing
something he didn't wanna do.

52:28.930 --> 52:31.649
And here you are looking to protect
the tourists from New York.

52:31.730 --> 52:35.143
Turns out New York needs
to protect Itself from the tourists.

52:35.230 --> 52:37.061
Wrong case for you. Sorry.

52:38.440 --> 52:41.318
Do you have any idea what's coming
down the pipe, Detective?

52:41.400 --> 52:42.697
What?

52:43.700 --> 52:45.110
A new Knapp Commission?

52:45.700 --> 52:46.940
A new broom?

52:47.660 --> 52:49.116
You know who benefits?

52:49.870 --> 52:53.169
Cats like you get all of the ink.

52:53.750 --> 52:55.331
You know who gets it in the neck?

52:55.420 --> 52:58.207
Cops who get suckered in.

52:59.170 --> 53:01.673
Next thing they know, they get shot
and nobody lifts a finger.

53:01.760 --> 53:04.388
Two years later,
everybody's still stealing,

53:04.470 --> 53:05.505
like nothing ever happened.

53:05.600 --> 53:06.999
That's not what this is about.

53:08.850 --> 53:10.727
Do you know what are
the two greatest crime fighters

53:10.810 --> 53:11.970
we have in this city?

53:13.690 --> 53:15.931
Sheetrock and cranes.

53:29.290 --> 53:30.780
Fucking Christ.

53:31.580 --> 53:32.740
What's the problem?

53:34.000 --> 53:36.286
See what's happening
around the corner on Dyer?

53:37.880 --> 53:42.544
Guys are carting shit off a truck,
I go see what's what.

53:42.720 --> 53:45.541
It's Hodas again,
opening another parlor.

53:45.640 --> 53:48.757
This one right between two of ours.
That motherfucker!

53:53.940 --> 53:56.556
Vin? It's me. Guess what?

53:57.060 --> 53:59.437
Another fucking Hodas joint's
going up.

54:00.570 --> 54:01.889
Right down the street!

54:01.990 --> 54:03.605
Right between us and the Geisha House.

54:03.740 --> 54:06.152
All right, I'll get
with Rudy then. Bye.

54:10.080 --> 54:11.320
- Hey, Vince.
- Yeah.

54:11.410 --> 54:14.493
Hey. Gotta get with Tommy Longo, man.
Maybe Rudy, too.

54:14.580 --> 54:15.740
I'm kind of freaking out.

54:15.830 --> 54:17.878
Look, I got somewhere to be tonight.

54:17.960 --> 54:19.871
Why don't you just go
talk to him yourself?

54:23.090 --> 54:24.296
- Alone?
- Yeah.

54:24.380 --> 54:25.620
You're paying him too, right?

54:25.720 --> 54:27.335
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

54:29.100 --> 54:30.385
Babe, come on, we gotta go.

54:30.470 --> 54:32.802
Kitchen's gonna close.
They stay open late, but come on.

54:33.430 --> 54:36.183
- Now?
- Yeah, now. Now or never.

54:36.270 --> 54:37.976
Come on, I thought
you wanted to grab a bite.

54:38.060 --> 54:39.266
Okay, just, um...

54:39.730 --> 54:41.641
Abby. You.

54:43.360 --> 54:44.395
Abby.

54:45.990 --> 54:47.309
Hello?

54:49.120 --> 54:50.519
Oh, my God. Hey.

54:52.240 --> 54:53.992
Sure. Sure. Where?

54:54.330 --> 54:55.536
Abby.

54:57.290 --> 54:59.030
I'm coming right now.

55:01.340 --> 55:04.047
Vin, something came up. I'm sorry.

55:04.300 --> 55:06.336
What do you mean, "something came up"?

55:08.550 --> 55:09.539
What?

55:11.930 --> 55:13.215
What about dinner?

55:30.910 --> 55:32.696
That negligee's too long for you.

55:32.830 --> 55:34.821
You're gonna trip
and break your neck in here.

55:35.330 --> 55:37.491
Borrowed it from my sister,
who's a giant.

55:43.420 --> 55:44.739
How about this?

55:46.050 --> 55:48.166
Everybody says,
when it comes to women's wear,

55:48.260 --> 55:49.466
I have excellent taste.

55:49.550 --> 55:51.211
If you trust me,
I'll pick you up a few nice things

55:51.300 --> 55:52.881
and bring them in tomorrow.

55:54.890 --> 55:56.676
That's how I am with my friends.

55:59.140 --> 56:00.687
Man is a hopeless romantic.

56:06.900 --> 56:08.777
Well,
whatever you want to do...

56:34.890 --> 56:36.596
And one strategy
I was thinking about

56:36.680 --> 56:39.592
is focusing on the massage parlors,
the peeps,

56:39.930 --> 56:41.761
a group of us standing outside
with cameras

56:41.980 --> 56:43.686
and shooting the johns going in.

56:44.270 --> 56:45.726
- Shooting the johns.
- I don't like it.

56:45.820 --> 56:48.220
I mean, you're talking about
public shaming.

56:48.320 --> 56:50.060
It could come back on us in a bad way.

56:50.150 --> 56:51.356
It's not about the johns.

56:51.450 --> 56:53.406
It's about whoever's making money
off these women.

56:53.490 --> 56:54.616
Hold on a sec.

56:54.700 --> 56:56.736
The reality is that the pimps
are always gonna pimp,

56:56.830 --> 56:58.366
and johns are always gonna spend,

56:58.700 --> 57:01.407
and the higher-ups will always
find a way to cash in.

57:01.500 --> 57:04.378
So, why do anything?
Is that what you're saying?

57:04.500 --> 57:05.706
No, that's not what I'm saying.

57:05.790 --> 57:08.372
I'm saying what do the women need
in order to get out?

57:10.340 --> 57:11.750
And if they're not ready to get out,

57:11.840 --> 57:14.138
then what do they need
in order to survive?

57:14.220 --> 57:17.007
Look, the bigger issues
are the bigger issues.

57:17.560 --> 57:21.098
Political, criminal,
public awareness, whatever.
