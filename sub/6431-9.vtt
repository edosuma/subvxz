Previously on
<i>Warehouse 13...</i>

00:02.860 --> 00:05.562
You are allowed to reveal
the true nature of our work

00:05.630 --> 00:07.064
to one person.

00:07.131 --> 00:09.866
I was insubordinate.

00:09.934 --> 00:11.995
I drew my gun on Mrs. Frederic,

00:12.063 --> 00:13.333
and she fired me.

00:13.401 --> 00:15.565
We answer
to a higher authority.

00:15.633 --> 00:16.798
These are the Regents.

00:20.094 --> 00:22.028
Phil!

00:22.096 --> 00:26.066
You are the Guardian now.

00:26.133 --> 00:30.265
I want you to meet
my partner.

00:30.333 --> 00:31.700
Mom.

00:33.001 --> 00:35.099
You can't be a Regent!

00:35.166 --> 00:37.335
Okay? You're my mom.
My mom can't be a Regent.

00:37.402 --> 00:39.605
How can my mom be a Regent
and not have told me?

00:39.672 --> 00:40.772
I'm sorry, Pete.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.443
Just calm down
and let me explain.

00:42.511 --> 00:44.412
Okay, fine, explain.

00:44.479 --> 00:46.146
Explain why
you didn't tell me.

00:46.214 --> 00:48.081
I wanted to tell you,
Pete, but I--

00:48.148 --> 00:49.848
But you didn't,
so I went on living my life

00:49.916 --> 00:52.685
on some kind of
need-to-know basis.

00:52.752 --> 00:53.919
No, it wasn't like that.

00:53.987 --> 00:56.290
It was a lot more complicated.

00:56.358 --> 00:57.658
Peter, please sit down.
I can't concentrate on what--

00:57.726 --> 00:58.692
Fine.

00:58.760 --> 01:01.427
I'm sorry, darling.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.396
I will explain it all.

01:03.463 --> 01:04.730
Just let me start
at the beginning.

01:04.798 --> 01:06.065
Some other time, Jane.

01:08.470 --> 01:10.605
A time when the Warehouse
isn't under attack

01:10.673 --> 01:13.308
and someone isn't
trying to kill you.

01:13.376 --> 01:15.544
Arthur's researching
the company

01:15.612 --> 01:17.279
that funded your mercenary,

01:17.347 --> 01:18.880
A to Z Technologies.

01:18.948 --> 01:20.782
We are not equipped
for military action,

01:20.850 --> 01:23.752
yet it would seem
we're at war.

01:23.820 --> 01:26.421
A to Z Technologies.

01:26.489 --> 01:29.724
There's something
about that name.

01:29.792 --> 01:31.426
I have a very bad
feeling about it.

01:31.494 --> 01:33.528
You what?

01:33.595 --> 01:36.298
You what?
You have a feeling?

01:36.366 --> 01:38.401
You mean like--like--
like my kind of feeling?

01:38.468 --> 01:40.036
You get vibes too?

01:40.104 --> 01:42.705
Oh, jeez Louise.

01:42.773 --> 01:44.975
Do I know anything
about you at all?

01:45.042 --> 01:46.576
Peter, please.

01:46.643 --> 01:48.978
Irene, I can't put
my finger on it,

01:49.045 --> 01:53.215
but that name is
familiar to me and important.

01:53.282 --> 01:57.184
Okay, just--
just tell me this.

01:57.252 --> 01:59.020
If the Regents
hadn't been attacked,

01:59.087 --> 02:01.523
would you...

02:01.591 --> 02:04.427
Or you...

02:04.494 --> 02:06.095
Have ever told me?

02:12.870 --> 02:14.037
Yeah.

02:14.104 --> 02:15.672
That's--
that's what I thought.

02:25.217 --> 02:26.817
He needs time, Irene.

02:26.885 --> 02:29.887
We don't have any time, Jane.

02:40.433 --> 02:42.200
Jason.

02:42.268 --> 02:44.270
I'm just running
to the store.

02:44.337 --> 02:46.605
Oh, don't forget to stop
at the dry cleaners.

02:46.673 --> 02:49.642
Okay, I'll be back
in an hour.

02:57.049 --> 02:59.884
Whoa, what was that?

03:01.486 --> 03:04.555
Jason, the car won't start.

03:06.057 --> 03:09.059
Jason?

03:09.127 --> 03:12.729
Jason?

03:27.078 --> 03:28.512
No, I'm not gonna
leave it alone

03:28.579 --> 03:29.713
because you still haven't
answered my question, Artie.

03:29.781 --> 03:32.149
Why did you fire Steve?

03:32.216 --> 03:34.117
Look, someone is picking
off the Regents one by one.

03:34.185 --> 03:35.786
We just can't sit here
and do nothing.

03:35.853 --> 03:38.021
I didn't fire Steve.
Mrs. Frederic did.

03:38.089 --> 03:39.556
And we are not doing nothing.

03:39.624 --> 03:40.824
Leena and I are fortifying
the warehouse,

03:40.892 --> 03:43.260
and regent security
is investigating.

03:43.327 --> 03:44.761
Well, there's obviously more
to this than you're telling me.

03:44.829 --> 03:46.530
Steve pulled a gun
on Mrs. Frederic?

03:46.597 --> 03:48.699
- We have to find--
- Enough!

03:48.766 --> 03:50.233
Let this go,
both of you.

03:50.301 --> 03:51.501
We have a ping.

03:51.569 --> 03:53.036
A man in Portland,

03:53.104 --> 03:54.771
he vanished from
his driveway yesterday

03:54.839 --> 03:56.574
in a brilliant flash
of light,

03:56.641 --> 03:57.842
and I am sending
the two of you.

03:57.909 --> 03:59.143
We can't work
a case right now.

03:59.211 --> 04:00.578
Artie, I just lost
my partner.

04:00.646 --> 04:02.046
You can't expect me to just
dive back into a case

04:02.114 --> 04:03.281
without getting some answers.

04:03.348 --> 04:04.915
Silence!

04:04.983 --> 04:07.518
This is not
snag, bag, and nag.

04:07.586 --> 04:09.820
When I say go, you go.

04:09.888 --> 04:13.690
Now, march!

04:13.758 --> 04:16.226
Not you.

04:16.293 --> 04:17.226
Stay.
Go back to your bed.

04:21.666 --> 04:22.799
Yes.

04:22.867 --> 04:24.434
See, why can't they all
be like you?

04:35.212 --> 04:36.446
Hey.

04:41.953 --> 04:45.722
You, uh...Wanna talk?

04:51.929 --> 04:53.563
I know how hard it must be

04:53.631 --> 04:56.098
for you to find out
about your mom like that.

04:56.166 --> 04:59.569
I--I can't imagine
if it was me.

04:59.637 --> 05:02.872
Well...

05:02.940 --> 05:04.741
You might feel
like an idiot.

05:04.808 --> 05:07.877
And you might feel

05:07.944 --> 05:10.212
like you never really knew
your own mother.

05:10.279 --> 05:11.813
She's your mom, Pete.

05:11.881 --> 05:13.215
Of course you know her.

05:13.282 --> 05:15.083
I mean, I even know her
a little bit.

05:15.151 --> 05:18.220
We did survive a crumbling
building together.

05:18.287 --> 05:22.490
And I think that she's
a brave, strong, amazing woman

05:22.558 --> 05:24.893
who loves you very much.

05:24.961 --> 05:26.962
Then why wouldn't
she tell me?

05:27.030 --> 05:28.998
I mean,
I'm a Warehouse Agent.

05:29.065 --> 05:30.799
It's not like I'm not in
on the secret.

05:30.867 --> 05:32.067
I don't know.

05:32.135 --> 05:33.835
But she had to have
her reasons, right?

05:33.903 --> 05:35.470
Maybe she was trying
to protect you.

05:35.538 --> 05:37.039
Oh, right.

05:37.106 --> 05:39.808
Or maybe my whole life

05:39.876 --> 05:41.210
has been one big lie.

05:41.278 --> 05:43.412
I'm just some pawn
of the Regents

05:43.480 --> 05:45.514
and Mrs. Frederic.

05:45.582 --> 05:47.616
Ever since I found out
that Sam was killed

05:47.684 --> 05:49.952
because of an artifact,

05:50.020 --> 05:52.488
I've started to wonder
if we all are.

05:55.692 --> 05:58.794
But I've also started
to wonder if it matters.

05:58.862 --> 06:00.796
It matters.

06:08.070 --> 06:09.003
Are you happy?

06:09.071 --> 06:10.505
That's not the point, Myka.

06:10.573 --> 06:12.107
Because I think you are.

06:12.175 --> 06:13.241
And what difference
does it make

06:13.309 --> 06:14.910
if it's a part
of a master plan

06:14.977 --> 06:16.945
or if it's just dumb luck?

06:17.013 --> 06:19.281
It makes
a difference to me.

06:23.719 --> 06:25.152
I've lied to him.

06:25.220 --> 06:27.254
Violated his trust.

06:27.322 --> 06:28.923
What kind of mother does that?

06:28.990 --> 06:30.324
A good one.

06:30.392 --> 06:33.093
It's not easy for us
doing what we do.

06:33.161 --> 06:35.795
We keep so many secrets

06:35.863 --> 06:38.498
even from our own children.

06:40.902 --> 06:43.537
It's different
for you, Irene.

06:43.605 --> 06:45.339
Your son isn't an agent.

06:45.407 --> 06:48.642
You knew I didn't
want this for Pete.

06:48.710 --> 06:51.913
I was always afraid something
like this would happen.

06:51.980 --> 06:54.649
We went against my wishes.

06:54.717 --> 06:56.786
Jane, he belongs here.
You know he does.

06:56.853 --> 07:00.256
You raised him for this
without even realizing it.

07:02.092 --> 07:03.293
He'll come around.

07:03.360 --> 07:05.662
But right now I need
for you to concentrate

07:05.730 --> 07:07.698
on A to Z Technologies.

07:07.765 --> 07:09.433
I've been trying.

07:09.501 --> 07:14.038
If I could just somehow
dig out that memory.

07:16.876 --> 07:19.711
Of course.
Why didn't I think of that?

07:19.779 --> 07:21.613
Come with me.

07:30.056 --> 07:32.957
Okay, so according
to Mrs. Kinser,

07:33.025 --> 07:34.592
her husband was standing
right there

07:34.660 --> 07:37.562
when he disappeared
in a big flash of light.

07:37.630 --> 07:38.663
Anything else?

07:38.731 --> 07:40.365
Clap of thunder?
Poof of smoke?

07:40.433 --> 07:42.234
No, no smoke,
but she did say

07:42.301 --> 07:44.569
that after the flash
her car battery died,

07:44.637 --> 07:45.837
the porch lights blew,

07:45.905 --> 07:47.439
and the power
around the entire block

07:47.506 --> 07:48.807
went out for a few seconds.

07:48.874 --> 07:50.875
Okay, so what,
something magnetic?

07:50.943 --> 07:52.210
Maybe.

07:52.277 --> 07:53.377
That draws its energy

07:53.445 --> 07:54.812
from the power sources
around it.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.714
Okay, I'll call Artie,
see if anything pops.

07:56.781 --> 07:58.048
Could you do it
from the car?

07:58.116 --> 07:59.817
I want to check out
that T-shirt shop

07:59.885 --> 08:01.886
that Kinser ran downtown.

08:01.953 --> 08:04.923
Yeah, okay.

08:07.594 --> 08:09.661
Alien abduction.
It all fits.

08:09.729 --> 08:11.330
The flash of light
was the aliens

08:11.398 --> 08:13.666
transporting Mr. Kinser
to their ship.

08:13.733 --> 08:16.068
And the power outage
was caused by the surge

08:16.136 --> 08:18.571
from their engine boosters.

08:18.639 --> 08:22.242
Well, that's a theory.

08:22.310 --> 08:24.478
Viola, right?
Are you the manager?

08:24.546 --> 08:26.280
I'm the manager.

08:26.347 --> 08:27.981
Come on in.

08:28.049 --> 08:30.184
Oh, God, Jeff.

08:30.252 --> 08:31.486
None of this,
none of that.

08:31.553 --> 08:33.354
More glitter on that.

08:33.422 --> 08:35.924
Wow, looks like glitter's
making a comeback.

08:35.991 --> 08:37.525
So Stan says.

08:37.592 --> 08:40.227
Thanks to him,
I have found it everywhere.

08:40.296 --> 08:42.395
You know, I even found some
in my vajayjay.

08:42.464 --> 08:44.265
Viola!

08:44.333 --> 08:45.834
Kinser laid off
half the staff,

08:45.902 --> 08:47.669
but I'm the reason
these guys are so efficient.

08:47.737 --> 08:49.572
Kinser fired
a lot of good artists,

08:49.639 --> 08:51.373
and he wasn't particularly
nice about it.

08:51.441 --> 08:53.843
Jeff McMasters,
Director of Design.

08:53.910 --> 08:55.178
So Kinser was tough
to work for, huh?

08:55.245 --> 08:57.680
Ugh, he was very
business-y.

08:57.748 --> 09:00.149
That's probably why
the aliens wanted him.

09:00.217 --> 09:02.152
Jason Kinser only cared
about the bottom line.

09:02.220 --> 09:04.655
He had no respect for the art
or the artists.

09:04.723 --> 09:07.057
Was there anyone who was
particularly upset

09:07.125 --> 09:08.459
about the layoffs?

09:08.527 --> 09:10.127
Anyone probably more upset
than the others?

09:10.195 --> 09:12.931
They were all
pretty postal.

09:12.998 --> 09:14.433
Okay, well, listen, we're
gonna need a list of names,

09:14.500 --> 09:16.268
and we have to talk
to the rest of the employees.

09:16.336 --> 09:18.237
Do you think that some
of the people Kinser fired

09:18.304 --> 09:19.471
were body-snatched?

09:22.008 --> 09:23.576
Maybe.

09:27.213 --> 09:28.414
Hey, it's Brandon.
Buzz me in.

09:33.253 --> 09:35.454
Look, let me in,
will you?

09:35.522 --> 09:36.655
Look, I'm not mad,
all right?

09:36.723 --> 09:37.889
I think I deserve
an explanation though.

09:37.957 --> 09:39.824
I want to talk face-to-face,
all right?

09:42.194 --> 09:44.528
What the hell?

09:44.596 --> 09:46.630
I know you're up there.

09:49.568 --> 09:51.736
I can see you!

09:51.803 --> 09:54.038
I'm not leaving until you come
down and talk to me!

09:55.607 --> 09:56.908
Well, come on!

09:56.976 --> 09:58.810
Come on!

10:12.089 --> 10:13.523
We have another
disappearance.

10:13.591 --> 10:15.458
There was a second random
power outage earlier today.

10:15.526 --> 10:18.127
I cross-referenced
with missing person reports.

10:18.195 --> 10:19.629
A computer programmer
called the cops

10:19.697 --> 10:21.965
and said his roommate went
missing at around the same time.

10:22.033 --> 10:23.833
But so far
there's no connection

10:23.900 --> 10:27.036
between him and our first
victim, Jason Kinser.

10:27.104 --> 10:28.471
Probably because
the connection

10:28.538 --> 10:29.972
is on the alien ship.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.508
- What?
- Nothing.

10:31.575 --> 10:34.745
Don't worry.
We're on it.

10:34.813 --> 10:37.782
There have to be other ways,
less risky ways.

10:37.850 --> 10:40.151
Travel back in your memories
and watch them?

10:40.219 --> 10:42.921
Oh, yes, hundreds.

10:42.989 --> 10:44.823
You're joking, right?

10:44.891 --> 10:46.425
I'm very dry.

10:46.493 --> 10:48.360
I understand your concern,
Agent Nielsen,

10:48.428 --> 10:49.861
and I appreciate it.

10:49.929 --> 10:52.296
But someone out there
is targeting Regents,

10:52.364 --> 10:53.497
and so far
we have nothing.

10:53.565 --> 10:55.867
We have A to Z Technologies.

10:55.934 --> 10:57.835
That information is buried
deeply in Jane's memory,

10:57.903 --> 10:59.903
unless you've unearthed
some answers.

10:59.971 --> 11:01.939
A to A Tech
is a shell company

11:02.006 --> 11:04.808
within a shell company
within another shell company.

11:04.875 --> 11:06.943
But I've managed to trace it
to the Cayman Islands

11:07.011 --> 11:08.545
where I have a contact
who could,

11:08.613 --> 11:11.147
if he's--if he's still alive,

11:11.215 --> 11:13.883
he could possibly...

11:13.951 --> 11:15.552
Okay, fine.

11:15.619 --> 11:17.821
But you understand
the dangers?

11:17.888 --> 11:20.056
You could get lost
in your own memories,

11:20.124 --> 11:22.559
and you could wind up
trapped there forever.

11:22.627 --> 11:23.927
A chance
I'm willing to take.

11:23.995 --> 11:25.862
But you won't have
to take it alone.

11:25.930 --> 11:27.830
The artifacts dangers
can be diminished

11:27.898 --> 11:30.132
if there's another
person present,

11:30.200 --> 11:32.701
someone to ground you,
to pull you back if need be,

11:32.769 --> 11:33.936
which is why
I'm going with you.

11:34.004 --> 11:36.305
No.

11:36.372 --> 11:37.506
I want to go.

11:37.573 --> 11:40.809
Into my memories?

11:40.876 --> 11:43.845
Well, it's my life too.

11:43.913 --> 11:45.813
At least I thought it was.

11:53.022 --> 11:54.389
You each touch
one of the shoes,

11:54.457 --> 11:56.892
and, Jane, concentrate
on what you wanna see,

11:56.959 --> 11:58.393
focus on your question.

11:58.461 --> 12:01.363
- A to Z Technologies.
- Precisely.

12:01.430 --> 12:02.864
The shoe will walk
your subconscious

12:02.932 --> 12:04.399
to the specific memory
you're seeking.

12:04.467 --> 12:06.835
Keep in mind that you'll
be observers only.

12:06.902 --> 12:08.636
You won't be able to interact
with anyone.

12:08.704 --> 12:10.838
You won't be able
to change the past.

12:10.906 --> 12:12.140
What's so dangerous then?

12:12.208 --> 12:13.842
Going back through
old memories,

12:13.910 --> 12:16.445
sometimes the urge
to stay is overwhelming.

12:16.512 --> 12:19.981
And that would result
in a permanent split.

12:20.049 --> 12:22.350
That's why you have to be
there to pull her back.

12:24.587 --> 12:26.054
We don't want our energies
to interfere,

12:26.122 --> 12:27.322
but we'll be close by.

12:35.566 --> 12:36.999
Whoa.

12:37.067 --> 12:38.968
It's the house.

12:39.035 --> 12:41.003
We're--we're really
at the house.

12:41.071 --> 12:43.672
Hey, it's my BMX bike.

12:43.740 --> 12:45.207
Wrecked it when I was 13.

12:45.275 --> 12:47.009
Doug Beam and I
made that ramp.

12:47.077 --> 12:49.178
Oh, my God,
Doug Beam.

12:49.246 --> 12:51.014
I wonder what he's
doing now.

12:51.081 --> 12:52.648
I can't believe it.

12:52.716 --> 12:54.284
It's exactly the same.

12:54.351 --> 12:57.620
This doesn't have anything to
do with A to Z Technologies.

12:57.688 --> 12:59.089
I shouldn't
have let you come.

12:59.156 --> 13:00.990
This isn't where I'm
supposed to be.

13:01.058 --> 13:03.693
Yeah, well, maybe it's
where I'm supposed to be.

13:03.761 --> 13:05.529
I'm gonna go see dad.

13:08.767 --> 13:10.734
Oh, no, it's not this day.

13:11.837 --> 13:14.405
Pete, wait!

13:33.692 --> 13:35.159
I'm so sorry, Pete.

13:46.037 --> 13:47.304
I know something's wrong

13:47.371 --> 13:48.405
because we were
supposed to meet

13:48.472 --> 13:50.240
at the David Lynch Festival,

13:50.308 --> 13:52.642
and Brandon never misses
David Lynch.

13:52.710 --> 13:53.843
Do you know where he was

13:53.911 --> 13:54.978
before you were supposed
to meet him?

13:55.046 --> 13:56.012
Yeah, he was picking
this girl up

13:56.080 --> 13:57.380
that he's been dating.

13:57.448 --> 13:59.182
It's pretty serious,
this was the third date.

13:59.249 --> 14:00.817
He was gonna turn her on
to <i>Eraserhead.</i>

14:00.884 --> 14:03.220
Anyway,
I tried calling her,

14:03.287 --> 14:04.621
and she didn't
pick up either.

14:04.689 --> 14:06.123
Do you know this girl?

14:06.191 --> 14:08.392
No, but I've heard
about her.

14:08.460 --> 14:10.161
A lot about her.

14:10.229 --> 14:12.864
And by "a lot" you mean?

14:12.931 --> 14:15.700
She's got golden hair that
smells like grapefruits.

14:15.768 --> 14:18.403
These sexy, spooky
Lolita eyes.

14:18.470 --> 14:20.271
This rockin' bod
that makes him just wanna--

14:20.338 --> 14:22.173
A lot, got it.

14:22.241 --> 14:24.342
You get a name
with that vivid description?

14:24.410 --> 14:26.679
Megan.
Megan Reese.

14:26.746 --> 14:28.147
I know that name.

14:28.215 --> 14:31.516
That name I think
is on the list

14:31.584 --> 14:35.053
of former employees.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.188
Megan Reese used to work
for Jason Kinser.

14:37.255 --> 14:40.024
Dots,
thou have been connected.

14:40.091 --> 14:42.460
So I guess the landlady
didn't see anything,

14:42.527 --> 14:43.994
but she definitely
heard Brandon out here

14:44.062 --> 14:45.162
caterwauling the other day.

14:45.230 --> 14:46.297
Caterwauling?

14:46.364 --> 14:47.531
Yeah, her word, not mine.

14:47.599 --> 14:49.467
I like the way it rolls
off the tongue though.

14:49.535 --> 14:52.136
Well, the neighbors reported
that there was a power outage

14:52.204 --> 14:54.105
right about
the same time that Brandon

14:54.173 --> 14:55.740
would have disappeared.

14:55.808 --> 14:57.409
And that's Megan's
apartment, right?

14:57.476 --> 14:59.344
Ugh, what do you wanna be
we find her dead mother

14:59.412 --> 15:00.779
in a rocking chair up there?

15:00.846 --> 15:03.982
I think I like
the alien idea better.

15:06.018 --> 15:07.785
Claudia.

15:07.853 --> 15:09.921
What is it?

15:09.989 --> 15:11.223
I don't know,

15:11.290 --> 15:15.160
but it looks familiar.

15:15.228 --> 15:18.796
Mrs. Kinser reported
that there was a flash of light,

15:18.864 --> 15:21.598
her porch lights blew,
and her car battery died, right?

15:21.666 --> 15:23.000
I could have been caused
by something like

15:23.068 --> 15:26.503
an electromagnetic pulse.

15:26.571 --> 15:29.673
I've seen this before
in photos of the aftermath

15:29.741 --> 15:30.707
of Hiroshima.

15:30.775 --> 15:32.109
There were impressions,

15:32.177 --> 15:34.144
almost shadows
of the victims

15:34.212 --> 15:36.046
that were left
after the bombs fell.

15:36.114 --> 15:37.581
But Jason Kinser was in
the middle of his yard,

15:37.649 --> 15:38.816
so there was no place
to see a shadow.

15:38.883 --> 15:40.384
Right.

15:40.452 --> 15:43.087
Are we saying that whatever
happened to Brandon might--

15:43.155 --> 15:46.257
Might be something nuclear.

15:46.325 --> 15:47.559
Oh, Megan Reese.

15:47.626 --> 15:49.394
Late with her rent.

15:49.462 --> 15:51.496
Won't come out,
won't let me in.

15:51.564 --> 15:53.532
I can't even get
the handyman in there

15:53.599 --> 15:55.967
to fix the pipes.

15:56.035 --> 15:57.802
Can't say I'm sorry
you're here.

15:57.870 --> 16:00.605
This looks like as good
a time as any

16:00.673 --> 16:03.174
to tell her to pack up
her things and skedaddle.

16:03.242 --> 16:05.143
Ma'am, now might not be
the best time--

16:05.211 --> 16:07.312
Come on,
Rapunzel, open up!

16:07.379 --> 16:09.347
You're in a truckload
of trouble.

16:09.415 --> 16:11.516
Go away!
Leave me alone!

16:11.583 --> 16:13.384
See?
See that?

16:13.452 --> 16:17.288
You're this close
to eviction, missy.

16:17.356 --> 16:19.490
Get away from here!
Get away from the door!

16:19.558 --> 16:22.360
Hey, it's my door!

16:22.427 --> 16:24.495
Ma'am, leave.

16:24.563 --> 16:25.529
Now.

16:34.638 --> 16:36.706
Megan, Secret Service,
open up!

16:36.773 --> 16:39.107
Go away, please.
Just go away.

16:39.175 --> 16:42.878
We can't do that, Megan.
Open the door.

16:42.946 --> 16:44.780
No!

16:52.655 --> 16:54.589
Go away before it's too late.

16:54.657 --> 16:55.757
If you don't,
I will kill you too

16:55.825 --> 16:56.958
just like the others.

16:57.026 --> 16:58.727
I warned you.

16:58.795 --> 17:00.662
And now you're gonna die.
Watch out!

17:18.220 --> 17:20.288
Okay, Megan.

17:20.356 --> 17:22.657
All right, it's okay.

17:22.724 --> 17:24.726
We're just, uh--

17:24.794 --> 17:26.896
we're gonna put these away.

17:26.963 --> 17:29.799
All right?

17:29.867 --> 17:30.900
Myka, what are you doing?

17:30.968 --> 17:32.334
We're still here.

17:32.402 --> 17:33.602
No one died.

17:33.670 --> 17:34.904
Yet.

17:34.972 --> 17:38.841
Megan, just give us
the artifact.

17:38.909 --> 17:40.877
What are you talking about?

17:40.945 --> 17:42.245
The object you're using
to kill people,

17:42.313 --> 17:43.480
whatever it is.

17:43.547 --> 17:45.482
There's no object.

17:45.549 --> 17:47.951
It's me.

17:48.019 --> 17:49.854
Every time I get upset,
people explode.

17:49.921 --> 17:51.855
I'm cursed.
I'm a monster.

17:51.923 --> 17:53.757
You're not a monster.

17:53.825 --> 17:55.158
Just go away please.

17:55.226 --> 17:57.360
Don't you understand?
I am gonna kill you.

17:57.428 --> 17:59.095
- Please!
- Myka!

17:59.163 --> 18:00.997
Okay.
Okay, look,

18:01.065 --> 18:02.666
just calm down, all right?

18:02.733 --> 18:04.401
We're stepping away.
It's okay.

18:08.872 --> 18:12.308
Myka, what the frak?

18:12.376 --> 18:13.642
She doesn't want
to hurt us, Claudia.

18:13.710 --> 18:15.111
She doesn't even know
what the artifact is.

18:15.179 --> 18:17.180
Artifactus unconscious?

18:17.247 --> 18:18.448
She's not in control of it.

18:18.515 --> 18:19.782
Yeah, but you heard her.

18:19.850 --> 18:21.050
People get whammied
whenever she gets upset.

18:21.118 --> 18:22.485
And if you haven't noticed,

18:22.552 --> 18:24.987
our being here is making her
very upset.

18:25.055 --> 18:26.254
Right, so we'll
just figure out

18:26.322 --> 18:27.656
whatever the artifact is--

18:27.723 --> 18:29.825
Without getting flash-fried?
Oh, fun.

18:29.893 --> 18:31.926
Claudia, look,
the girl is in trouble.

18:42.871 --> 18:44.371
Fine, but if her hair
starts blowing around

18:44.439 --> 18:46.941
like <i>Firestarter</i>,
we're outta here.

18:50.645 --> 18:52.279
You still need to eat.

18:52.347 --> 18:54.882
Oh, God, my Jeannie.

18:54.950 --> 18:56.117
Can I get you something?

18:56.185 --> 18:57.285
I can't now.

18:57.353 --> 18:59.921
I can't believe he's gone.

18:59.989 --> 19:01.856
She can't see us, can she?

19:01.924 --> 19:04.593
I won't go
through this again.

19:04.660 --> 19:06.561
Mom.

19:06.629 --> 19:10.465
Mom, look at you.

19:18.007 --> 19:20.175
It'll get better, Pete.
It will.

19:20.243 --> 19:22.611
Lattimer!

19:28.316 --> 19:30.718
Even Ralph Brunsky
was nice to me that day.

19:30.786 --> 19:32.486
Mrs. Frederic?

19:32.554 --> 19:33.821
Hey, what are you doing here?

19:33.889 --> 19:35.990
I thought this was only
a two passenger--

19:38.560 --> 19:39.827
Mrs. Frederic was here?

19:39.894 --> 19:41.796
She knew me my whole life?

19:41.863 --> 19:43.798
Jane, I'm so sorry.

19:43.865 --> 19:45.567
We all are.

19:45.634 --> 19:46.802
What?
Tell me.

19:46.869 --> 19:48.704
It wasn't a fire?
An artifact killed him?

19:48.772 --> 19:50.373
No, there was
no artifact.

19:50.440 --> 19:53.709
He was a firefighter,
a very brave one.

19:56.613 --> 19:58.381
Then why are you here?

19:58.449 --> 20:02.218
To extend our condolences.

20:02.286 --> 20:03.719
And to ask you to come back.

20:03.787 --> 20:05.755
The Warehouse needs you.

20:05.822 --> 20:08.123
There's a situation
right here in town that--

20:08.191 --> 20:09.491
No.

20:09.559 --> 20:11.994
No.

20:12.061 --> 20:13.695
Thank you for coming, Irene.

20:36.852 --> 20:40.621
God, I wish I could laugh
like that again.

20:40.689 --> 20:44.425
Listen, whatever this is,
the freakness,

20:44.493 --> 20:47.294
it can mess you up,
but believe me

20:47.362 --> 20:49.630
there is a way back,
and we're gonna find it.

20:49.698 --> 20:51.165
What makes you so sure?

20:51.233 --> 20:52.700
Because I've been there.

20:52.767 --> 20:55.102
I doubt it.

20:55.170 --> 20:56.704
You'd be surprised.

20:56.772 --> 20:59.374
There's nothing.

20:59.441 --> 21:01.376
Megan, when did this start?

21:01.443 --> 21:03.711
A couple months ago

21:03.779 --> 21:06.581
back in Indiana.

21:06.648 --> 21:09.417
I got mugged.

21:09.485 --> 21:12.721
This guy grabbed me.

21:12.788 --> 21:14.923
I got away.

21:14.991 --> 21:18.961
And then all the lights
just blew out.

21:19.028 --> 21:20.895
He was gone.

21:20.963 --> 21:22.497
Then it happened
to my boyfriend.

21:22.565 --> 21:26.734
We got in this big fight.

21:26.802 --> 21:28.603
He shoved me.

21:28.671 --> 21:31.906
And I got mad and then--

21:33.909 --> 21:37.278
I came here so I could get
away from it.

21:37.346 --> 21:38.946
But you couldn't?

21:39.014 --> 21:40.748
No, I did.

21:40.815 --> 21:42.216
I did.
It was okay.

21:42.284 --> 21:45.786
I--I got a new job
at the T-shirt shop,

21:45.854 --> 21:47.955
and I met Brandon.

21:48.023 --> 21:51.959
But then this woman
rear-ended me,

21:52.027 --> 21:54.795
and she was yelling.

21:54.863 --> 21:57.864
And then my boss fired me

21:57.932 --> 21:59.833
for being late.

21:59.901 --> 22:01.768
And then Brandon
got mad at me.

22:01.836 --> 22:03.102
Come on!

22:03.170 --> 22:05.104
What am I--

22:05.172 --> 22:06.973
What am I gonna do?

22:07.040 --> 22:08.141
Megan, Megan,
keep it together.

22:08.208 --> 22:12.078
Don't melt down.

22:12.145 --> 22:13.679
The yearbook.

22:13.746 --> 22:15.313
It's the yearbook.

22:15.381 --> 22:17.282
Megan.
Bag it!

22:23.022 --> 22:25.490
Don't suppose you've seen
any aliens, have you?

22:32.633 --> 22:36.069
There is no such thing
as just a Regent.

22:36.136 --> 22:39.806
You're instincts have provided
an invaluable perspective.

22:39.873 --> 22:40.807
Stop.

22:40.874 --> 22:42.108
I left all that behind

22:42.176 --> 22:43.309
when I had children
of my own.

22:43.377 --> 22:44.844
You think that's gonna
change now?

22:44.912 --> 22:47.113
So did dad know?

22:47.181 --> 22:50.550
Of course,
he was my one.

22:50.618 --> 22:53.319
Of all the days
to come here.

22:53.387 --> 22:56.255
I wouldn't have but we're
facing a difficult decision,

22:56.323 --> 22:59.225
the kind you've always
been helpful with.

22:59.293 --> 23:00.894
Warehouses have gotten along
just fine without me

23:00.961 --> 23:02.095
for millennia.

23:02.162 --> 23:04.330
But always with people
like you.

23:04.398 --> 23:06.833
Jane...

23:06.901 --> 23:10.069
We need your
particular expertise.

23:12.540 --> 23:14.174
There's a child.

23:18.947 --> 23:20.614
At least consider it.

23:23.251 --> 23:25.386
I'll be in touch.

23:31.393 --> 23:33.194
Wow.

23:33.261 --> 23:36.897
So not just a Regent,
but a Super Regent.

23:36.965 --> 23:38.465
Man, if I'd have known
I'd have got you a mug

23:38.533 --> 23:41.167
that said, "World's
Greatest Secret Overlord."

23:42.503 --> 23:44.604
Mom!

23:44.671 --> 23:46.705
You'd just break it
like all the others.

23:54.147 --> 23:55.881
Maybe--maybe the artifact
isn't here.

23:55.949 --> 23:56.915
It's me.

23:56.983 --> 23:58.417
People are dying around me.

23:58.485 --> 23:59.685
I'm the problem.

23:59.753 --> 24:00.986
Wait a minute,
no, no, no, no.

24:01.054 --> 24:02.721
You were nowhere near
your boss when he died.

24:02.789 --> 24:04.022
Right, when your boss
disappeared,

24:04.090 --> 24:05.590
you were here.

24:05.658 --> 24:06.725
Could she have contacted
an artifact elsewhere

24:06.793 --> 24:07.759
and still be affected by it?

24:07.827 --> 24:09.127
The T-shirt shop.

24:09.195 --> 24:10.796
That's the only thing
that makes sense.

24:10.864 --> 24:13.165
We need to go there,
and you have to come with us.

24:13.233 --> 24:16.134
Oh, no,
I'm not leaving here.

24:16.202 --> 24:18.503
Oh, no, you could
be a big help.

24:18.571 --> 24:19.738
You know, maybe something
about being there

24:19.805 --> 24:21.573
could spark some--

24:21.640 --> 24:24.042
oh, wow.

24:24.109 --> 24:26.978
Bad choice of words.
Anyway.

24:28.580 --> 24:30.081
Stop right there.
Where do you think you're going?

24:30.148 --> 24:32.182
- Keep her away.
- Ma'am, go back inside.

24:32.250 --> 24:33.450
Keep here away from me!

24:33.518 --> 24:34.918
Keep me away from you?

24:34.986 --> 24:36.320
You're two weeks late
on your rent.

24:36.388 --> 24:38.456
Ma'am, go back inside
for your own protection.

24:38.524 --> 24:40.124
Don't talk to me that way.
I know my rights.

24:40.192 --> 24:42.127
Don't make me angry!

24:42.194 --> 24:43.428
I'm throwing you out!

24:49.801 --> 24:50.934
- I killed her.
- No, Megan--

24:51.002 --> 24:52.002
I killed her.

24:52.070 --> 24:53.270
No, no, no, no, Megan!

24:53.337 --> 24:54.471
Claudia, wait.

24:54.538 --> 24:56.372
In this state
she could kill us both.

25:05.462 --> 25:07.197
What?

25:07.264 --> 25:08.865
The angle of the shadow.

25:08.933 --> 25:12.135
I mean, the flash must have
come from that direction

25:12.202 --> 25:14.070
to cast a shadow
on the sign this way,

25:14.137 --> 25:15.805
but Megan was standing
over there.

25:15.872 --> 25:18.374
So artifact that way?

25:18.442 --> 25:20.109
You try and find Megan,
talk her down.

25:20.177 --> 25:21.277
I'm gonna check this out.

25:21.345 --> 25:24.414
Yeah, you got it.

25:26.951 --> 25:28.151
Oh, my God,
I remember this.

25:28.219 --> 25:29.719
Oh, you couldn't
possibly know--

25:29.787 --> 25:31.621
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait for it.

25:31.689 --> 25:33.189
Yo, mom, watch this.

25:42.032 --> 25:44.868
That was my best move,
and I got nothing out of you.

25:44.936 --> 25:46.403
Nothing.
You did it a lot.

25:46.471 --> 25:49.139
Changing grape juice to milk
doesn't make it new.

25:49.207 --> 25:50.807
I was trying
to cheer you up.

25:52.410 --> 25:54.644
Hello?

25:54.712 --> 25:57.714
Jane, have you had time
to consider our invitation?

25:57.782 --> 25:59.182
The matter I mentioned
needs to be resolved

25:59.250 --> 26:00.250
rather quickly.

26:00.318 --> 26:01.517
Who's that?

26:01.585 --> 26:04.387
No one, sweetheart.
Eat your lunch.

26:04.455 --> 26:05.955
Tell me more.

26:06.023 --> 26:10.026
You were taking secret Regent
calls in front of me?

26:10.094 --> 26:13.263
All right,
I'm on my way.

26:13.331 --> 26:14.999
You're gonna have to finish
lunch without me, Petey.

26:15.066 --> 26:16.434
Okay, I'll be back in time
to make dinner.

26:16.501 --> 26:17.701
Why?
Where are you going?

26:17.769 --> 26:19.637
It's a gorgeous day.
Call Ralph Brunksy.

26:25.477 --> 26:27.712
Walter,
lunch in ten minutes.

26:27.780 --> 26:30.148
Okay.

26:37.757 --> 26:39.591
- Some swing.
- Thanks.

26:39.659 --> 26:40.826
Must be the star
of your team.

26:40.894 --> 26:41.961
I guess so.

26:42.028 --> 26:44.664
Coach says I could even
go pro someday.

26:44.731 --> 26:46.432
But coach says stuff
like that a lot.

26:50.938 --> 26:54.141
You sound like
a practical man.

26:54.208 --> 26:55.776
What else are
you interested in?

26:55.843 --> 26:56.977
Got any hobbies?

26:59.113 --> 27:00.313
Do I know you?

27:00.381 --> 27:02.382
Do you live around here?

27:07.288 --> 27:09.489
Just taking a walk.
Here you go.

27:15.396 --> 27:16.797
Well, that looked important.

27:16.864 --> 27:18.365
Pete.

27:18.433 --> 27:19.833
You know better than anyone

27:19.901 --> 27:22.303
the delicate nature
of dealing with artifacts.

27:22.371 --> 27:24.105
There's always a downside.

27:24.173 --> 27:27.275
That boy had an ability
he shouldn't have.

27:27.343 --> 27:29.211
Taking it away was
a heart-wrenching decision.

27:29.278 --> 27:30.645
What's the big deal?

27:30.713 --> 27:31.913
The kid wouldn't go pro.

27:31.981 --> 27:33.482
Was it really
worth lying to us?

27:33.549 --> 27:35.050
You know the truth now.

27:35.118 --> 27:36.752
It doesn't matter now.

27:36.820 --> 27:39.122
I was 12 years old,
and all I knew then

27:39.189 --> 27:42.558
was that you were keeping
secrets and I felt left out.

27:42.626 --> 27:44.159
We all have things
we have to do,

27:44.227 --> 27:45.794
and I had to do this.

27:45.862 --> 27:47.429
You know I couldn't tell you.

27:47.497 --> 27:49.131
No, I don't know.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.269
After dad died,

27:53.336 --> 27:55.938
why couldn't I
have been your one?

28:09.887 --> 28:13.622
So I ask myself,

28:13.690 --> 28:15.491
where would I run to
in the middle of the city

28:15.558 --> 28:17.560
if I wanted to get
as far away as possible

28:17.628 --> 28:20.163
from anyone I could hurt?

28:24.002 --> 28:26.136
Keep telling you,
we're a lot alike.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.742
You vaporize people
with your mind a lot, do you?

28:30.809 --> 28:33.078
I definitely have the
"Make people disappear" curse.

28:38.651 --> 28:41.452
I recently lost a--

28:41.520 --> 28:43.087
a really good friend.

28:45.791 --> 28:47.092
He didn't, like,
die or anything,

28:47.159 --> 28:49.861
but he's just gone.

28:49.929 --> 28:51.296
Not exactly the same.

28:55.601 --> 28:58.569
I have a boyfriend in
the Witness Protection program.

28:58.637 --> 29:00.071
Impressive.

29:00.139 --> 29:03.007
But still...

29:03.075 --> 29:04.676
My brother disappeared into
an inter-dimensional bubble.

29:04.743 --> 29:05.877
What?

29:05.945 --> 29:08.113
Took me 12 years
to get him back.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.914
Fine.

29:09.982 --> 29:11.850
You're cursed too.
Congratulations.

29:11.918 --> 29:13.585
Thank you.

29:13.653 --> 29:15.721
Maybe we should start
a support group

29:15.789 --> 29:19.091
called the Arms Length Club.

29:19.159 --> 29:20.626
I don't think so.

29:23.463 --> 29:25.165
The Ten-Foot Pole Society.

29:25.232 --> 29:28.469
Nice. Better.

29:28.536 --> 29:30.871
Sorry.

29:30.939 --> 29:33.807
It's been a while since
I could just talk to someone.

30:12.914 --> 30:14.281
Claude, did you find Megan?

30:14.348 --> 30:15.615
Safe and sound.

30:15.683 --> 30:18.686
We're bonding over our ability
to repel people.

30:18.754 --> 30:20.288
Well, I don't think
Megan's causing this.

30:20.356 --> 30:22.924
Somehow this thing can shoot
radiation from a distance.

30:22.991 --> 30:25.259
Listen, I'm on the roof,
and I found glitter up here.

30:25.327 --> 30:28.428
So it's probably somebody
from the T-shirt shop.

30:28.496 --> 30:29.896
But it happened here
in Portland

30:29.964 --> 30:31.365
and back in Indiana.

30:31.432 --> 30:33.266
Well, then they had
to follow you.

30:33.334 --> 30:34.868
The yearbook.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.082
Ah-ha.

30:54.419 --> 30:56.387
Hey, Claude, look.

30:56.455 --> 30:58.823
Jeff McMasters.

30:58.891 --> 31:00.958
Okay, we interviewed him
at the shop.

31:01.026 --> 31:02.527
Megan, he went
to school with you.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.262
I hardly knew that kid.

31:06.966 --> 31:09.534
Look, Megan, he's in
a lot of your pictures.

31:11.737 --> 31:14.205
And he's staring at you.

31:14.272 --> 31:15.639
Looks like you have
a stalker.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.908
Megan, if this guy is willing
to kill for you,

31:17.976 --> 31:21.911
then--then your life
is in danger too.

31:32.349 --> 31:34.516
The way that the stalker
mentality works,

31:34.584 --> 31:36.651
you probably had some kind
of exchange with him

31:36.719 --> 31:37.819
in high school,

31:37.887 --> 31:39.087
something that
meant nothing to you

31:39.155 --> 31:41.189
but that meant
the world to him.

31:41.257 --> 31:43.392
Ever since,
he's been fixated on you.

31:43.459 --> 31:44.693
And now he has an artifact,

31:44.761 --> 31:45.927
and he's using it to kill

31:45.995 --> 31:47.362
whoever he thinks
is a threat to you.

31:47.430 --> 31:49.164
Probably thinks he's doing it
to protect you.

31:49.232 --> 31:50.933
Protect me?

31:51.001 --> 31:53.169
He's killing people
and wrecking my life.

31:53.237 --> 31:54.871
And we're going
to make him stop.

31:54.938 --> 31:58.541
But first we need to find
whatever it is that he's using,

31:58.609 --> 32:02.044
and to do that, well,
we're gonna need your help.

32:13.157 --> 32:14.524
Hey, it's Artie

32:14.592 --> 32:17.327
and MacPherson before he went
all dark lord, I guess.

32:22.966 --> 32:25.068
We've changed
that boy's life forever.

32:25.136 --> 32:27.504
No, we returned it
to its natural course.

32:27.572 --> 32:29.106
I only hope
we did it in time.

32:29.173 --> 32:30.574
The downside of that artifact

32:30.641 --> 32:34.244
would have been far worse
that its upside.

32:34.312 --> 32:36.880
Okay, so if being a Regent
is that hard,

32:36.947 --> 32:39.049
how did Mrs. Frederic
convince you to go back?

32:39.116 --> 32:40.817
She didn't.

32:40.884 --> 32:42.919
Your father did.

32:46.924 --> 32:48.591
Come on.

32:51.729 --> 32:53.329
You ever see a dead body?

32:53.397 --> 32:54.965
Why you wanna go ask that?

32:55.032 --> 32:56.867
You did.
Is it cool?

32:56.935 --> 33:00.104
Really isn't.

33:00.172 --> 33:03.208
Any of the guys you ever
work with die?

33:03.276 --> 33:05.277
Well, um...

33:05.345 --> 33:07.112
Yeah.

33:07.180 --> 33:08.380
It happens.

33:12.519 --> 33:15.688
I don't think I want you
to be a firefighter anymore.

33:17.658 --> 33:19.926
Pete.

33:19.994 --> 33:23.329
You're a big man,
and I never want to lie to you.

33:23.397 --> 33:24.631
It's a dangerous job,

33:24.699 --> 33:26.366
and sometimes
bad things happen.

33:26.434 --> 33:27.968
Sometimes things happen

33:28.036 --> 33:30.204
that I'm not gonna
want to talk about

33:30.271 --> 33:32.406
'cause they're gross.

33:32.474 --> 33:35.476
Nah, it isn't the fun kinda
gross like you think.

33:35.544 --> 33:39.881
But what I'm doing out there,
I'm doing it for you.

33:39.949 --> 33:42.417
I'm doing it for your sister
and your mom.

33:42.485 --> 33:45.287
'Cause if me and guys like me
don't do this job,

33:45.354 --> 33:47.956
the whole town
could burn down.

33:48.023 --> 33:49.958
Guys like me
make a choice, Pete,

33:50.025 --> 33:53.161
to be the ones
that keep the world safe.

33:55.231 --> 33:57.700
Even if that means it takes
us away from the ones we love.

33:57.767 --> 34:00.535
But it's because
of that love

34:00.603 --> 34:02.671
that we do it.

34:06.943 --> 34:08.811
I wanna be
that kinda guy too.

34:11.047 --> 34:12.882
You are that kinda guy.

34:18.290 --> 34:20.024
All right, one more.

34:22.594 --> 34:24.763
We should go now.

34:28.467 --> 34:32.304
No, no,
I wanna stay awhile.

34:32.371 --> 34:36.241
Peter,
it's time to go.

34:50.491 --> 34:51.425
Mom.

34:51.492 --> 34:52.525
Pete, it's all right.

34:52.594 --> 34:53.793
No, look, mom,

34:53.862 --> 34:56.531
when I found out about this,

34:56.599 --> 34:58.366
I guess I thought

34:58.434 --> 35:02.070
being a Regent was more
important to you than I was.

35:02.138 --> 35:05.274
I was a Regent

35:05.342 --> 35:08.244
because nothing is more
important to me than you are.

35:08.312 --> 35:10.413
You and your sister.

35:10.481 --> 35:14.051
And I had nothing to do with
you becoming an agent either.

35:14.118 --> 35:17.821
You did that.

35:17.889 --> 35:19.423
I was against it.

35:19.491 --> 35:21.092
Wait, what?
Why?

35:21.160 --> 35:22.427
Nothing.
Never mind.

35:22.494 --> 35:24.095
No, Mom, I wanna know.

35:24.163 --> 35:26.130
Oh, Peter, you were always
taking unnecessary risks.

35:26.198 --> 35:27.498
Oh, my God,
this is like when I asked

35:27.565 --> 35:28.999
if I could go out for football,
and you were like,

35:29.067 --> 35:30.701
"Peter, you're gonna
get hurt out there."

35:30.769 --> 35:33.704
I should never have let you
read all those comic books.

35:38.309 --> 35:39.342
Hi.

35:39.410 --> 35:42.279
Jeff.

35:42.346 --> 35:43.580
- It's Megan.
- I know.

35:43.647 --> 35:45.948
Believe me, I know.

35:46.016 --> 35:47.850
I was starting to wonder
if you remembered my name.

35:47.918 --> 35:49.318
What?

35:49.386 --> 35:50.520
Yes, I do.

35:50.587 --> 35:52.422
Well, it's just,

35:52.489 --> 35:54.657
you haven't said anything
since that time

35:54.725 --> 35:57.160
you got Murphy and his morons
to leave me alone.

35:57.228 --> 35:59.296
On that field trip?

35:59.364 --> 36:02.033
Field trip, right.

36:02.101 --> 36:06.004
So that's why you've
been protecting me.

36:06.071 --> 36:08.006
I thought after you had
a reason to stay away,

36:08.073 --> 36:11.009
so I followed your lead.

36:11.077 --> 36:12.310
I hope I did
the right thing.

36:12.378 --> 36:15.413
Sure.
You did just right.

36:15.481 --> 36:18.450
It's so cool to finally
be talking like this,

36:18.517 --> 36:19.984
to talk to you at all.

36:20.052 --> 36:22.720
How are you doing it, Jeff?

36:22.788 --> 36:26.390
I mean, how are you making
people just go away?

36:26.458 --> 36:27.625
Come here.

36:27.692 --> 36:29.393
When I found these,

36:29.461 --> 36:31.462
I knew it was a sign.

36:39.571 --> 36:41.939
Why are you talking to me now?

36:43.876 --> 36:46.311
What are you looking at?

36:46.378 --> 36:48.280
Jeff, listen to me.
Just put down the bag.

36:48.348 --> 36:50.115
- We're not gonna hurt you.
- You lied to me!

36:51.918 --> 36:53.219
No, I didn't.
No, I didn't lie.

36:53.286 --> 36:54.820
You don't remember anything!

36:54.888 --> 36:57.757
After all I've done for you,
you bring them here?

36:57.824 --> 37:00.225
No! Megan!

37:00.293 --> 37:01.293
Megan!

37:01.361 --> 37:03.428
Come on, come on.

37:03.496 --> 37:04.629
After all this time,

37:04.697 --> 37:06.198
all those secret
glances you gave me,

37:06.265 --> 37:07.432
what, you decided
you're done with me now?

37:07.500 --> 37:09.167
Stop it!

37:09.235 --> 37:10.868
The artifact's in his bag,

37:10.936 --> 37:11.969
so keep
your eyes out for it.

37:12.037 --> 37:13.538
Legitimate question.

37:13.605 --> 37:15.406
If he's toting
a radiation-shooting artifact,

37:15.474 --> 37:16.674
do we risk our Teslas?

37:23.448 --> 37:24.314
Jeff?

37:26.951 --> 37:29.620
Listen, nobody else
needs to get hurt.

37:29.687 --> 37:30.954
We can find a way
out of this.

37:31.022 --> 37:32.689
Myka!

37:32.757 --> 37:33.857
Stay away!

37:33.925 --> 37:36.426
This is between me and her!

37:36.493 --> 37:37.394
Myka, look out!

37:48.373 --> 37:49.439
Hey.

37:49.507 --> 37:50.840
Are you okay?
He's coming.

37:50.908 --> 37:52.942
You're gonna pay for having
lied to me, Megan!

37:53.009 --> 37:55.411
And your friends
are gonna pay too!

37:59.149 --> 38:01.116
All the doors are locked.
You can't get out.

38:09.092 --> 38:12.127
I told you to stay away.

38:12.194 --> 38:14.129
You want me, Jeff?

38:14.197 --> 38:15.163
I'm right here.

38:15.231 --> 38:17.065
I loved you, Megan.

38:19.835 --> 38:21.937
Ahh!

38:27.576 --> 38:28.810
You okay?

38:28.878 --> 38:30.211
Yeah.

38:38.354 --> 38:41.256
Hey, you did good.

38:47.582 --> 38:49.568
The binoculars belonged
to the pilot of the plane

38:49.569 --> 38:51.481
that dropped the bomb
on Hiroshima.

38:51.482 --> 38:52.815
He saw the blast through them,

38:52.883 --> 38:54.985
and they absorbed the horror
of that moment.

38:55.052 --> 38:57.153
Right, so when Jeff found
them and looked through them,

38:57.221 --> 38:59.689
all his emotions, his rage
just set them off.

38:59.757 --> 39:01.124
So you were never
actually cursed.

39:01.192 --> 39:02.658
I'm guessing you weren't
really cursed either.

39:02.726 --> 39:04.293
Now, see,
that's just crazy talk,

39:04.360 --> 39:05.594
because I'm
so totally cursed.

39:05.662 --> 39:07.729
I mean, right?

39:07.796 --> 39:10.131
Look, thanks.

39:10.199 --> 39:12.333
For everything.

39:12.401 --> 39:14.769
I hope you hear back
from your best friend.

39:18.908 --> 39:21.543
- Bye.
- Bye, Megan.

39:23.846 --> 39:25.347
I'm gonna make a call.

39:25.415 --> 39:26.715
- Claude.
- Yep?

39:26.783 --> 39:28.083
Say hi for me.

39:28.151 --> 39:30.085
- Mm-hmm.

39:35.759 --> 39:36.960
Well, it's like
when you wouldn't

39:37.027 --> 39:38.995
let me grate the celery
for the Thanksgiving--

39:39.063 --> 39:41.164
And we were nibbling
on fingers as a result.

39:41.232 --> 39:43.066
Bad example.

39:43.134 --> 39:44.568
Did you find anything?

39:44.636 --> 39:46.603
I did, but I may have messed
up what mom was looking for.

39:46.671 --> 39:48.372
Don't be so sure.

39:48.440 --> 39:51.208
Artie, where is Collodi's
bracelet shelved?

39:51.276 --> 39:53.377
Collodi's bracelet?

39:53.444 --> 39:55.812
James and I bagged that,
what, 30 years ago.

39:55.880 --> 39:56.980
I know.

39:57.048 --> 39:58.147
You were so cute.

40:07.123 --> 40:10.659
Carlo Collodi wrote the
original story of Pinocchio.

40:10.727 --> 40:13.362
For the most part he was
an angry, bitter satirist.

40:13.430 --> 40:15.531
In the original one,
the little cricket

40:15.599 --> 40:16.966
tries to tell Pinocchio
what to do.

40:17.034 --> 40:18.534
He flattens him with a hammer.

40:18.602 --> 40:20.270
Here.

40:20.337 --> 40:23.540
It was made out of the strings
of a marionette.

40:23.607 --> 40:24.975
It belonged to Collodi.

40:25.042 --> 40:27.644
I think it fell into
the hands of a young boy.

40:27.712 --> 40:29.814
Named Walter Sykes.

40:33.118 --> 40:35.019
The bracelet gave him control
of his own body,

40:35.087 --> 40:37.723
enabling him to walk.

40:37.790 --> 40:40.992
But it would have planted
a seed of darkness in his soul.

40:44.563 --> 40:45.496
Aztec.

40:45.564 --> 40:47.164
A to Z Technologies.

40:47.232 --> 40:48.966
That's what I was remembering.

40:49.034 --> 40:51.301
That young boy is now the man
who is attacking us.

40:51.369 --> 40:54.204
Walter Sykes.

41:07.752 --> 41:09.519
The guardian that now
wears the shackle

41:09.586 --> 41:11.554
is under watch 24/7.

41:11.622 --> 41:13.989
I don't see any way
to get to her.

41:14.057 --> 41:16.225
No need to.

41:18.594 --> 41:21.896
Jane Lattimer and I are gonna
be getting together very soon.

41:21.964 --> 41:24.198
I'm looking forward to it.

41:24.266 --> 41:26.200
And meeting her son.

41:28.370 --> 41:29.537
There's one more road

41:29.605 --> 41:30.638
I need you to go down though,
Marcus.

41:30.705 --> 41:32.339
Steve Jinks.

41:32.407 --> 41:34.608
Stukowski was right,
he's vulnerable.

41:34.676 --> 41:36.978
Yeah.

41:37.045 --> 41:38.713
Find a way
to get to him.

41:38.781 --> 41:40.281
Yes, sir.

41:40.349 --> 41:43.584
Could you get that book
over there for me, Marcus?

41:49.825 --> 41:51.826
Oh, that's Lok Archer.

41:51.893 --> 41:53.294
He used to be a Regent.

41:56.031 --> 41:57.865
He isn't anymore.

41:57.933 --> 42:02.102
But his last act
was quite helpful to us.

42:17.718 --> 42:20.287
Recently I've come across
some useful information.

42:20.354 --> 42:23.222
You know, not destroying
the shackle was disappointing.

42:23.290 --> 42:25.958
But fortunately,

42:26.026 --> 42:29.027
there's another way.
