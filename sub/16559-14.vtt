WEBVTT

00:02.670 --> 00:04.460
Previously on "How To Get Away
With Murder"...

00:04.460 --> 00:06.120
He died
'cause I left him there.
We'll fix this.

00:06.120 --> 00:08.620
This is proof Mr. Lahey moved

00:08.620 --> 00:10.250
and hid the body
from Miss Atwood.

00:10.250 --> 00:12.290
I can fix this.
If you just give me a chance --

00:12.290 --> 00:14.250
Are you kidding?
You are suspended!

00:14.250 --> 00:16.540
Atwood admitted
she moved Wes' body.

00:16.540 --> 00:18.620
Why aren't we talking
about going after

00:18.620 --> 00:19.920
the people who killed Wes?

00:19.920 --> 00:21.170
We don't know
who killed him.

00:21.170 --> 00:23.040
He testified
against Charles Mahoney

00:23.040 --> 00:24.790
a week before he died.

00:24.790 --> 00:27.420
Laurel.
Wes was cremated.

00:27.420 --> 00:28.830
All this time,
you've been telling me

00:28.830 --> 00:29.880
Annalise was
hiding something

00:29.880 --> 00:31.380
when you're the one
with a secret.

00:31.380 --> 00:33.500
You went to Annalise's house
that night, didn't you?

00:33.500 --> 00:36.670
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:46.120 --> 00:47.670
It was my fault.

00:47.670 --> 00:51.210
I say that to myself so that
maybe I'll start to believe it

00:51.210 --> 00:54.540
and feel bad.

00:54.540 --> 00:57.790
Because I'll admit, right now,

00:57.790 --> 01:01.210
I don't feel that bad.

01:01.210 --> 01:06.330
It's like my brain
just broke...

01:06.330 --> 01:09.500
all the way.

01:09.500 --> 01:12.920
And I can't get that image
of her out of my head.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.170
I keep having this dream --

01:16.170 --> 01:18.290
cars crashing
into a convenience store,

01:18.290 --> 01:20.540
and there's all these people
trapped underneath.

01:20.540 --> 01:22.250
They're screaming at me
the most vile things

01:22.250 --> 01:23.500
that you've ever heard.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.380
Like, why can't
I just be happy for once?

01:26.380 --> 01:29.620
"Pile of trash,
You ugly whore."

01:29.620 --> 01:31.750
Mistake after stupid mistake.
-It's just stuck...

01:31.750 --> 01:34.120
-Why do I have to always be...
-...in a constant loop.

01:34.120 --> 01:36.040
...worrying about everyone else?

01:36.040 --> 01:37.880
-I just want to throw up.
-"Disgusting, repulsive,

01:37.880 --> 01:39.420
dried-up, old bitch."
-Hate me.

01:39.420 --> 01:42.330
-I hate it.
-I deserve it.

01:42.330 --> 01:43.580
It's just enough
to make me want to die.

02:27.710 --> 02:29.960
-Would you like to share?
-No.

02:29.960 --> 02:32.420
You sure?
We're good listeners.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.420
I'm new.

02:43.420 --> 02:45.580
But you already know that, so...

02:51.500 --> 02:57.290
And I have a problem...
with drinking, yes.

02:57.290 --> 02:59.670
But I got
other problems, too --

02:59.670 --> 03:01.040
lots of them.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.040
Like, I could take up
this entire meeting talking

03:03.040 --> 03:04.580
about them,
and you would be entertained.

03:04.580 --> 03:06.210
Trust me.

03:06.210 --> 03:07.960
But everyone's got problems.

03:07.960 --> 03:10.290
I mean, that's all you hear
in these meetings --

03:10.290 --> 03:12.540
men who can't afford to eat,
women who get beat up.

03:12.540 --> 03:15.750
There was even a woman in here
whose 6-year-old daughter died

03:15.750 --> 03:18.420
in a school shooting.

03:18.420 --> 03:21.290
I mean, the world is ugly.

03:21.290 --> 03:23.460
People get depressed,
and so they drink.

03:23.460 --> 03:25.500
That's clear.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.960
But, I don't know.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.580
Sitting in these rooms,
talking about it --

03:30.580 --> 03:32.540
I don't know.

03:32.540 --> 03:34.170
It's just...

03:37.040 --> 03:38.170
I mean, look at you.

03:38.170 --> 03:39.880
You've been coming here
for 26 years,

03:39.880 --> 03:42.120
and y-you're still a mess.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.790
I mean, what has coming here
done for you?

03:43.790 --> 03:46.710
I mean, tell me!

03:46.710 --> 03:52.540
There's got to be something
that you learned -- something --

03:52.540 --> 03:58.500
right, that you helps you
to feel better...

03:58.500 --> 04:02.000
other than this whining.

04:05.620 --> 04:09.380
I mean, tell me.

04:09.380 --> 04:10.710
Tell me what it is.

04:16.120 --> 04:17.540
Have you tried
meditation?

04:24.290 --> 04:27.420
I'll think about it.

04:28.670 --> 04:30.080
Where have you been?

04:30.080 --> 04:32.210
Running.
For two hours?

04:32.210 --> 04:33.960
You'll be the one that benefits
when I have abs.

04:36.540 --> 04:38.460
Y-You left your phone.
It kept ringing.

04:38.460 --> 04:41.420
I saw it was Bonnie,
so I answered it.

04:41.420 --> 04:43.210
There's a hearing
for Annalise tomorrow

04:43.210 --> 04:44.670
to get her charges dropped,
and they want you there.

04:46.960 --> 04:50.880
Maybe you should
tell them.

04:50.880 --> 04:53.460
They won't believe me.

04:53.460 --> 04:56.420
Well, I believe you.

04:56.420 --> 04:58.330
Do you?

04:58.330 --> 05:01.250
Yeah.

05:01.250 --> 05:02.580
That's convincing.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.620
Why are you ignoring
my texts?

05:12.620 --> 05:14.250
I've been busy.

05:14.250 --> 05:15.880
Busy ratting us out
to the fuzz?

05:15.880 --> 05:17.460
Would I be here
if I did?

05:17.460 --> 05:19.380
I don't know.
Maybe they put a wire on you.

05:19.380 --> 05:21.210
Copy that, officers?

05:21.210 --> 05:22.420
I didn't go to the cops.

05:22.420 --> 05:24.380
Did Oliver find something
on Annalise's phone?

05:24.380 --> 05:25.920
Is that
what you don't want to say?
No.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.330
Then what's wrong?
Nothing.

05:27.330 --> 05:29.670
-Why are you lying?
-'Cause he's always doing it.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.460
I brought you here to fill
the seats behind Annalise,

05:33.460 --> 05:34.670
not to bicker.

05:34.670 --> 05:36.000
Do I have
anything to worry about?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.080
Yeah.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.960
Worry about wasting
Annalise's time

05:39.960 --> 05:41.500
with this impossible motion
to dismiss.

05:43.620 --> 05:46.750
We win this,
and all of our problems go away,

05:46.750 --> 05:47.960
including yours.

05:47.960 --> 05:50.000
So get in there, sit down,

05:50.000 --> 05:52.420
and act like
you actually like Annalise.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.170
Is it true you were fired

05:56.170 --> 05:58.620
from the District Attorney's
office, Ms. Atwood?

05:58.620 --> 05:59.750
Yes.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.790
Why?

06:01.790 --> 06:03.620
I forged a signature
on the form

06:03.620 --> 06:06.580
ordering the transfer
of Wesley Gibbins' body.

06:06.580 --> 06:09.210
The signature of an investigator
from your office -- Nate Lahey?

06:10.250 --> 06:11.620
Yes.

06:11.620 --> 06:12.960
Can you explain
to the court

06:12.960 --> 06:15.250
why you would tamper
with evidence this way?

06:15.250 --> 06:16.750
Objection -- argumentative.

06:16.750 --> 06:18.750
It's probative
to the key issue of my motion --

06:18.750 --> 06:20.170
malicious prosecution.

06:20.170 --> 06:22.290
Overruled.

06:22.290 --> 06:24.500
I wasn't tampering
with evidence.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.000
I was protecting it.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.460
How does transferring a body
protect evidence?

06:28.460 --> 06:31.330
Ms. Keating has a history
of committing unlawful actions

06:31.330 --> 06:32.790
to win her cases.

06:32.790 --> 06:36.120
I was trying to protect
all of our evidence.

06:36.120 --> 06:36.830
Now.

06:40.170 --> 06:42.540
Transferring the body
broke chain of custody,

06:42.540 --> 06:44.620
according to Rule 901.

06:44.620 --> 06:48.420
Anyone, including you, could
have manipulated the evidence.

06:48.420 --> 06:49.790
But we will never be able
to prove that,

06:49.790 --> 06:51.960
because after transferring
the body,

06:51.960 --> 06:54.580
you also ordered its cremation.

06:54.580 --> 06:55.830
Isn't that true?
-Objection --

06:55.830 --> 06:57.460
assuming facts not in evidence.
-Sustained.

06:57.460 --> 06:58.380
Bonnie.

07:07.250 --> 07:10.080
As I'm sure you're aware,
the Rule of Spoliation states

07:10.080 --> 07:13.120
that you may not benefit from
the destruction of evidence.

07:13.120 --> 07:14.170
I never meant to.

07:14.170 --> 07:15.920
Intent is irrelevant.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.040
Your Honor,
who is trying the case here?

07:18.040 --> 07:20.210
Ms. Keating, either act
as your own counsel

07:20.210 --> 07:22.330
or advise your lawyer
on your own time.

07:26.960 --> 07:30.170
Ms. Atwood, did you
or did you not order

07:30.170 --> 07:32.250
the cremation
of Wesley Gibbins' body?

07:32.250 --> 07:33.960
I did not.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.830
Do you know who ordered
the cremation of Wesley Gibbins?

07:35.830 --> 07:37.080
No.

07:37.080 --> 07:39.210
Because you're lying
under oath?
No.

07:39.210 --> 07:40.420
Objection --
She's goading the witness.

07:40.420 --> 07:44.040
Sustained.

07:44.040 --> 07:44.750
No further questions.

07:50.750 --> 07:52.670
She just perjured
herself in there, right?

07:52.670 --> 07:54.710
-Of course.
-So we need to break her.

07:54.710 --> 07:57.420
We would've if I was the one
asking the questions.

07:57.420 --> 07:58.880
We go back in tomorrow,
so everyone come

07:58.880 --> 08:00.380
back to my house,
and we'll figure out ways

08:00.380 --> 08:01.790
to prove she lied.

08:01.790 --> 08:03.040
Has anyone considered
the possibility

08:03.040 --> 08:04.460
that Atwood has
nothing to do with this?

08:04.460 --> 08:06.290
Of course she does.

08:06.290 --> 08:08.120
The Mahoneys killed Wes and got
Atwood to help them cover it up.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.540
-Why would she do that?
-Why does anyone do anything?

08:09.540 --> 08:11.540
Money, son.

08:11.540 --> 08:14.000
When you have Mahoney's
cash, you can get people
to do anything.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.960
You can kill their pets,
have sex with creepy, old guys.

08:15.960 --> 08:17.500
-Annalise...
-So, you're saying you'd sleep

08:17.500 --> 08:19.120
with an old man
if someone paid you enough?

08:19.120 --> 08:21.120
Uh, with my bank account in its
current state, yeah, I would.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.540
Annalise.

08:22.540 --> 08:24.380
Charles Mahoney just got
released from jail.

08:26.420 --> 08:27.880
I can't express
how relieved we are

08:27.880 --> 08:30.000
that the prosecution
finally realized

08:30.000 --> 08:32.710
that the charges against me
were manufactured.

08:32.710 --> 08:35.670
Do you have plans to sue the
state for wrongful prosecution?

08:35.670 --> 08:36.790
No.

08:36.790 --> 08:39.120
Right now,
I just want to go home,

08:39.120 --> 08:42.040
spend some time
with my family.

08:42.040 --> 08:45.420
Mrs. Mahoney, are you happy
to put this all behind you?

08:45.420 --> 08:47.710
No, because
it isn't behind us.

08:47.710 --> 08:49.170
Can you tell us
what you mean by that?

08:49.170 --> 08:50.170
What'd I tell you?

08:50.170 --> 08:51.380
They probably paid off a judge
to get him released.

08:51.380 --> 08:52.920
Shh!

08:52.920 --> 08:56.040
My husband's murder is
still unsolved.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.380
So, while one nightmare
might be over,

08:58.380 --> 09:00.710
we are still deep
in the middle of another.

09:00.710 --> 09:04.500
I owe it to my husband
to find the person

09:04.500 --> 09:09.080
or persons who shot him dead
in the middle of the street.

09:09.080 --> 09:11.250
Turn it off.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.170
Great, so, we sit here and wait
for her to come kill us, too.

09:13.170 --> 09:14.750
She's not gonna kill us.

09:14.750 --> 09:17.500
She's gonna pay someone
to kill us.
No one's getting killed.

09:17.500 --> 09:19.790
You said so yourself that these
chuckleheads are dangerous.

09:19.790 --> 09:21.620
But Atwood isn't.

09:21.620 --> 09:23.830
She's the weak link.

09:23.830 --> 09:26.290
And if we find proof
that she had any contact

09:26.290 --> 09:28.710
with the Mahoneys,
they all go down.

09:28.710 --> 09:30.120
And isn't that
what you want,

09:30.120 --> 09:32.420
to find out who killed Wes
and how to make them pay?

09:34.080 --> 09:35.790
So, that's what we do.

09:35.790 --> 09:37.580
We don't stand
around here complaining.

09:37.580 --> 09:39.580
We act.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.580
So let's get to work.

09:53.380 --> 09:55.210
-You wanted to see me?
-Close the door.

09:59.330 --> 10:02.290
- I saw you in court today.
- Who were you there for?

10:02.290 --> 10:04.960
Atwood?
Or is it Annalise these days?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.290
I was there
'cause this is my case.

10:09.290 --> 10:10.880
That the only reason?

10:10.880 --> 10:12.540
'Cause this case
has been damaged enough

10:12.540 --> 10:16.250
by my A.D.A. tampering
with the victim's body.

10:16.250 --> 10:18.460
I had nothing
to do with that.
I know that now.

10:18.460 --> 10:20.790
But this whole department
is under a microscope.

10:20.790 --> 10:22.620
So I need you
to look me in the eye

10:22.620 --> 10:25.710
and tell me that you
are not in contact with Keating.

10:25.710 --> 10:28.210
We've been done
for a long time now.

10:28.210 --> 10:31.880
I'm not here to play games,
so either trust me or fire me.

10:31.880 --> 10:34.960
No one's getting fired.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.620
Good.

10:36.620 --> 10:39.170
What's this?

10:39.170 --> 10:41.830
Atwood's Wi-Fi password.

10:41.830 --> 10:43.750
She works out
of her home office sometimes,

10:43.750 --> 10:46.210
so if she had
any secret communications,

10:46.210 --> 10:47.250
she'd do it from there.

10:50.540 --> 10:51.920
You're welcome.

10:51.920 --> 10:53.830
If Denver finds out
that you're helping me,

10:53.830 --> 10:55.330
it could hurt both of us.
Don't worry about that.

10:55.330 --> 10:57.500
My ass could go to jail
for the rest of my life.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.170
It's my job to worry
about everything right now.

10:59.170 --> 11:00.460
Why do you think I'm here?

11:03.080 --> 11:04.580
Say "thank you."

11:07.540 --> 11:10.080
This is Atwood's
Wi-Fi password.

11:10.080 --> 11:12.120
Get into her computer,
phone records,

11:12.120 --> 11:13.540
bank statements,
anything that'll link her

11:13.540 --> 11:15.040
to the Mahoneys.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.790
Well, you got her password.
That saves me about an hour.

11:16.790 --> 11:18.960
The rest of you, dig
into the discovery of my case --

11:18.960 --> 11:20.620
police records, interviews.

11:20.620 --> 11:23.120
Chances are Atwood doctored
some of those, too.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.290
Oh, God.

11:25.290 --> 11:27.290
That's not for you.

11:27.290 --> 11:28.790
What is it?

11:28.790 --> 11:30.460
It's a file
that's better for Michaela.

11:30.460 --> 11:31.960
I have no idea
what you're doing.

11:31.960 --> 11:34.250
No, no, no, please, don't.
Please do--

11:56.000 --> 11:57.580
He looks better
than I thought.

12:15.790 --> 12:17.830
You okay?

12:17.830 --> 12:19.420
Yeah.

12:25.790 --> 12:27.830
What's going on
with you?

12:27.830 --> 12:29.670
Nothing.

12:29.670 --> 12:32.880
You can't even look me
in the eye.

12:32.880 --> 12:35.710
'Cause you're
so blindingly beautiful.

12:35.710 --> 12:37.620
You're mad at me
for taking Asher's side.

12:37.620 --> 12:39.420
Fine.
I get that.

12:39.420 --> 12:40.670
But I think
the two of us know better

12:40.670 --> 12:42.830
than to let some boy
ever come between us.

12:42.830 --> 12:45.500
The only way I've gotten
through any of this insanity

12:45.500 --> 12:47.830
is because we had
each other's backs.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.420
There's nothing
you can't say to me.

12:56.460 --> 12:58.170
I'm having
coming-out flashbacks.

13:00.670 --> 13:02.290
What is it?

13:07.170 --> 13:09.210
I got into Atwood's
landline records.

13:09.210 --> 13:11.830
Okay, so, she received a call
from this phone number

13:11.830 --> 13:13.580
on the night Wes died.

13:13.580 --> 13:15.710
She got another call
from that same number

13:15.710 --> 13:17.580
on the day that she had
Wes' body moved

13:17.580 --> 13:20.000
and again on the night
that he was cremated.

13:20.000 --> 13:20.920
It's a blocked number.

13:20.920 --> 13:21.960
It's probably a burner,

13:21.960 --> 13:24.420
which means
it's impossible to...

13:25.540 --> 13:27.460
To what?

13:27.460 --> 13:29.120
Uh...I'm sorry.

13:29.120 --> 13:31.290
There's no way for me to
find out whose number this is.

13:31.290 --> 13:32.710
-Unless we call it.
-We can't.

13:32.710 --> 13:33.880
Why not?

13:33.880 --> 13:35.120
If the Mahoneys
or one of their goons picked up,

13:35.120 --> 13:36.420
then we'd know they're
in cahoots with Atwood.

13:36.420 --> 13:38.290
And lets them know
that we're on to them.

13:38.290 --> 13:40.420
Keep digging. See if you can
trace the number to anyone.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.330
Um, I told you, I can't.

13:42.330 --> 13:44.460
Oliver, now, you've done
a lot of things this year

13:44.460 --> 13:45.790
you thought
you couldn't do.

13:45.790 --> 13:48.540
They'll believe you.
Shut up.

13:48.540 --> 13:49.380
What's going on?

13:52.080 --> 13:53.500
-Nothing.
-Michaela.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.170
I'm just not feeling
very well.

13:55.170 --> 13:57.330
What happened?
Did you say something to her?

13:57.330 --> 13:59.000
Asher.
No.
You can be an ass to me

13:59.000 --> 14:00.290
all you want
but not to my lady.

14:00.290 --> 14:02.000
Asher, I think you're probably
reading into things.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.290
He's not.
Michaela.

14:04.290 --> 14:05.710
Just tell them.

14:05.710 --> 14:06.960
Tell us what?

14:06.960 --> 14:08.830
Yeah, seriously,
what's going on?

14:08.830 --> 14:10.710
Uh, I think we should
just give Connor some space.

14:10.710 --> 14:11.620
Open your mouth.

14:11.620 --> 14:14.460
Connor might've killed Wes.

14:49.420 --> 14:51.170
You know,
you're much nicer on HumpR.

14:51.170 --> 14:52.290
That's 'cause
I wanted to get laid.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.710
You know what?

14:56.710 --> 14:59.120
You're the problem
with the gay community.

14:59.120 --> 15:01.880
You know, we all just treat each
other like a piece of meat.

15:01.880 --> 15:06.120
We're all the problem
with the gay community.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.960
It was nice meeting you.

15:16.120 --> 15:18.710
Hey, I realized
I don't have my phone.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.170
Could I borrow yours?

15:22.250 --> 15:24.040
Wow.
You're on a roll.

15:28.920 --> 15:31.120
Connor, it's Annalise.

15:31.120 --> 15:33.000
I need all of you
to come to the house.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.880
I got your voicemail.

15:35.880 --> 15:38.170
So I went to the house.

15:38.170 --> 15:39.120
It was open.

15:41.170 --> 15:43.580
Hello? Annalise?

15:53.880 --> 15:54.830
Annalise?

16:00.960 --> 16:03.120
I went in the basement.

16:03.120 --> 16:04.790
That's where I found him.

16:12.540 --> 16:14.250
Wes?

16:14.250 --> 16:16.670
Wes!

16:16.670 --> 16:18.460
Wes. Wes, wake up.

16:18.460 --> 16:19.960
Come on.

16:19.960 --> 16:22.710
Help!
Annalise!

16:22.710 --> 16:25.790
He didn't have a pulse.

16:25.790 --> 16:27.620
Or maybe I just couldn't
find it. I don't know.

16:27.620 --> 16:32.120
But his body was still warm,
so I started CPR.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

16:32.120 --> 16:35.000
Why didn't you call 911?
Because I didn't have my phone.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.710
There was a phone
in the house.
You weren't there.

16:37.710 --> 16:40.210
You don't understand.
I...

16:40.210 --> 16:44.120
I tried to save him.

16:44.120 --> 16:48.540
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

16:48.540 --> 16:49.540
Breathe.

16:49.540 --> 16:51.830
Come on, Wes!
Breathe!

16:51.830 --> 16:54.670
He wouldn't breathe,
so I-I kept doing

16:54.670 --> 16:56.380
the -- the compressions.

16:56.380 --> 16:57.750
But then...

17:01.290 --> 17:03.920
there was, like,
a -- like a crack,

17:03.920 --> 17:07.750
like a bone
or -- or rib or something.

17:07.750 --> 17:09.000
I don't know.
Maybe --

17:09.000 --> 17:10.580
Maybe that's what killed him,
you know, maybe, like,

17:10.580 --> 17:13.920
a -- a bone punctured
his lung or something.
No, no, Connor,

17:13.920 --> 17:16.290
h-he was hurt
before you got there.

17:16.290 --> 17:18.960
Hey, do not baby him
right now!
Connor, Connor, Connor.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.330
Did you see
if he was hurt?

17:20.330 --> 17:21.710
No.
Are you sure?

17:21.710 --> 17:23.420
Because that would help us
figure out how he died.

17:23.420 --> 17:25.790
I didn't see anything!
He just -- He just looked dead.

17:25.790 --> 17:27.540
Yeah, 'cause you left him
there to die!

17:27.540 --> 17:29.380
There was gas!
I smelled gas.

17:29.380 --> 17:31.540
Whoever killed him
cut the gas line.

17:31.540 --> 17:33.380
You mean you cut
the gas line.
Laurel.

17:33.380 --> 17:36.250
-Oh, God, Laurel.
-I swear I didn't do this!

17:39.120 --> 17:40.790
How are we supposed
to believe you right now?
Look at him!

17:40.790 --> 17:42.170
Look how guilty he feels.

17:42.170 --> 17:43.580
Yeah, maybe
'cause he killed him.

17:43.580 --> 17:44.670
Stop it.

17:44.670 --> 17:47.170
Why are you
just telling us this now?

17:47.170 --> 17:49.830
Because he was afraid
of this,

17:49.830 --> 17:51.620
that you would think
he did it,

17:51.620 --> 17:54.580
when the truth is
he was just in the wrong place

17:54.580 --> 17:56.420
at the wrong time.
Yeah, maybe that's
what he wants us to believe.

17:56.420 --> 17:59.580
Will you stop
attacking him, please?

17:59.580 --> 18:02.580
All of you have done
terrible things,

18:02.580 --> 18:04.580
and you have asked me
to believe that you did them

18:04.580 --> 18:05.880
for the right reasons.

18:05.880 --> 18:07.500
Well, now you need to do
the same thing for Connor.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.620
Yeah, he hated Wes.
No, I didn't.

18:09.620 --> 18:11.710
You blamed him
for everything!
Quiet.

18:11.710 --> 18:14.170
Please, Laurel, you're
just making it worse!
I couldn't kill anyone!
Yes, you could!

18:14.170 --> 18:16.080
So, you know what you need
to do right now?

18:16.080 --> 18:18.000
You need to go
and kill yourself.
Laurel, stop.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
That's the one good thing
you're gonna do in your life.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.790
You're gonna go, and you're
gonna kill yourself, Connor!
Laurel.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.960
Today's a good day for you.

18:37.960 --> 18:39.670
How's that?

18:43.420 --> 18:46.040
We're offering you
a plea deal.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.460
Admit Annalise ordered you
to kill Wes,

18:48.460 --> 18:50.000
and you'll be out
in seven years.

18:52.420 --> 18:55.830
Your case against Annalise is
in the toilet.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.290
Maybe it's time
you just give up.

18:57.290 --> 19:00.210
If the judge throws out
Annalise's case,

19:00.210 --> 19:01.620
my office is gonna have
to come up

19:01.620 --> 19:03.580
with an alternative theory...

19:03.580 --> 19:06.080
like...

19:06.080 --> 19:07.540
you and Laurel Castillo
killed Wes.

19:09.380 --> 19:10.920
She was
in the house that night,

19:10.920 --> 19:13.670
as were you,
according to your confession.

19:13.670 --> 19:15.170
Love triangle gone wrong.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.580
What do you have on her?

19:21.580 --> 19:23.960
Sign the deal,
and no one ever has to know.

19:28.580 --> 19:31.210
You could've kept
Annalise out of jail.

19:31.210 --> 19:33.460
How?

19:33.460 --> 19:35.420
By telling the police
that she wasn't at
the house that night.

19:35.420 --> 19:37.580
That doesn't mean
she didn't do this.

19:39.750 --> 19:42.210
Bonnie told you, right?

19:42.210 --> 19:43.710
This whole time,
I've been telling everyone

19:43.710 --> 19:45.540
that you killed Wes.

19:45.540 --> 19:48.000
You should be begging her
not to kill you right now,

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
not attacking her.
Why don't you let her speak
for herself?

19:57.420 --> 20:00.170
So...

20:00.170 --> 20:02.880
was it you?

20:02.880 --> 20:04.830
You killed him?

20:07.420 --> 20:08.750
Leave, Bonnie.

20:13.250 --> 20:14.830
Go.

20:22.580 --> 20:24.170
Move.

20:24.170 --> 20:26.960
Now.

20:31.420 --> 20:34.250
This is grief.

20:34.250 --> 20:36.750
You're trying to make sense out
of things that don't make sense,

20:36.750 --> 20:38.830
choosing a target
for your anger.

20:38.830 --> 20:41.420
You still haven't answered
my question.
You know the answer.

20:41.420 --> 20:43.290
I don't.

20:43.290 --> 20:47.500
Every bad thing that we've done
starts with you.
You're confused.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.750
Or I just don't know
how to bite my tongue anymore!

20:54.170 --> 20:57.290
Laurel's right.
You're deflecting.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.380
You are.
I never killed anyone.

20:59.380 --> 21:01.540
Neither have I!
You hacked up my husband,

21:01.540 --> 21:03.380
dumped his body
in a garbage bin.

21:03.380 --> 21:04.880
Because of Wes, okay?!

21:04.880 --> 21:06.790
We were all trying
to help him and you.

21:06.790 --> 21:08.710
There you go again,
deflecting.

21:08.710 --> 21:11.540
No, no, no, you two dragged us
into your Oedipal crap

21:11.540 --> 21:13.000
and we've all been trying
to clean it up!
You should've left!

21:13.000 --> 21:15.120
I tried.
Well, you bailed on that plan

21:15.120 --> 21:17.040
because your boyfriend
wouldn't run away with you.
I was trying to protect him
from you.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.250
You couldn't stand the idea
of spending one second alone.

21:19.250 --> 21:20.540
You don't know
anything about me.

21:20.540 --> 21:22.250
Well, I know
you're paranoid and broken,

21:22.250 --> 21:24.380
haven't trusted anyone
since you were a little boy.

21:24.380 --> 21:25.960
I know what you're
trying to do right now.
And you're still acting

21:25.960 --> 21:28.080
like that little boy,
making up ugly stories

21:28.080 --> 21:29.920
about people
because you're scared

21:29.920 --> 21:31.920
of anyone actually
getting to know you.

21:31.920 --> 21:33.880
Oh, God, you're so desperate
for that kid!
So you blame me for the mess

21:33.880 --> 21:37.580
that's been in your head
since the day you were born!
All your sons are dead!!

21:37.580 --> 21:40.460
They're all dead!

21:40.460 --> 21:43.250
And you can't use me
to replace them.

22:00.540 --> 22:01.880
Look me in the eye.

22:05.380 --> 22:06.710
Right here.

22:12.420 --> 22:14.830
You said
you didn't hurt Wes.

22:21.380 --> 22:23.670
So I believe you.

22:27.420 --> 22:30.880
But I need you
to believe me, too.

22:52.540 --> 22:53.960
Forgive him.

22:55.880 --> 22:57.460
No.

22:57.460 --> 22:59.210
He made a terrible mistake,

22:59.210 --> 23:01.620
just like we all have
at one point,

23:01.620 --> 23:03.210
but he apologized.

23:03.210 --> 23:04.830
I don't care.
Wes is still gone.

23:04.830 --> 23:06.170
But it's not Connor's fault.

23:06.170 --> 23:08.000
It's whoever killed him,
and that's where your anger

23:08.000 --> 23:10.500
needs to be going
right now.

23:10.500 --> 23:13.580
Otherwise, this boy
right here is gonna kill himself

23:13.580 --> 23:15.500
and we'll all have
more blood on our hands.

23:15.500 --> 23:17.380
Is that what you want?

23:21.500 --> 23:24.580
Forgive him.

23:31.250 --> 23:32.880
He had some big file
on Laurel.

23:32.880 --> 23:34.500
He's bluffing.
But what if he's not?

23:34.500 --> 23:36.210
He told you he's investigating
all the kids, right?

23:36.210 --> 23:37.790
To intimidate us.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.380
Don't fall for it.

23:42.380 --> 23:44.250
And don't do anything
without talking to me.

23:44.250 --> 23:45.210
Of course not.

23:47.710 --> 23:49.920
Where are you going?

23:49.920 --> 23:52.000
To buy a gun so that
I can use it on Connor.

23:54.710 --> 23:57.170
I have an OB appointment.

23:57.170 --> 23:58.080
Still pregnant.

24:00.170 --> 24:03.290
I really think that we should
call the mystery number.

24:03.290 --> 24:05.420
I can block my cell.
There's no way they'll
know it's mine.

24:05.420 --> 24:07.960
You heard Annalise.
No.

24:55.210 --> 24:57.080
Atwood was
just in New York.

24:57.080 --> 24:59.170
She parked in a garage
in the Financial District.

24:59.170 --> 25:00.880
-When?
-Today.

25:00.880 --> 25:02.080
Right after
Charles Mahoney was released.

25:05.250 --> 25:06.670
Hello?

25:07.960 --> 25:09.290
Was that a thank you?

25:09.290 --> 25:11.540
No.

25:11.540 --> 25:13.170
When the judge asks me
how I got the information,

25:13.170 --> 25:15.790
should I just tell them
that you broke into her car?

25:15.790 --> 25:17.290
I'm doing everything
I can, Annalise.

25:17.290 --> 25:18.880
-No, you're not.
-Excuse me?

25:21.920 --> 25:23.710
You should
just talk to her.

25:23.710 --> 25:25.580
You think she's gonna
confess to me?

25:25.580 --> 25:29.040
Well, she fell
for your moves before.

25:29.040 --> 25:31.460
Or are you not as charming
as you used to be?

25:32.500 --> 25:35.420
Okay.
I'm gonna hang up.

25:38.920 --> 25:42.750
Was that Nate?

25:42.750 --> 25:44.670
We need all the help
we can get.

25:44.670 --> 25:45.620
Wait.

25:47.750 --> 25:51.170
What if Connor isn't
telling us everything?

25:53.330 --> 25:55.210
Is there really
no vodka in the house?

25:55.210 --> 25:56.420
No.

26:04.120 --> 26:06.330
There's the yolk sac.

26:06.330 --> 26:10.750
That thicker area there is
the fetal pole.

26:10.750 --> 26:13.620
And...there you are.

26:15.250 --> 26:16.250
The heartbeat.

26:29.920 --> 26:32.210
It's a big decision.

26:33.960 --> 26:38.750
Yeah.

26:38.750 --> 26:41.080
How much time do I have?

26:41.080 --> 26:44.750
Pennsylvania allows abortions
up until 24 weeks.

26:44.750 --> 26:46.500
Just know
the law requires you

26:46.500 --> 26:48.500
to have a consultation
with counselors

26:48.500 --> 26:50.710
where all your options
are laid on the table

26:50.710 --> 26:53.170
24 hours
prior to the termination.

26:55.120 --> 26:56.460
Right.

27:03.670 --> 27:05.000
Meggy.

27:08.290 --> 27:09.290
Hey.

27:09.290 --> 27:10.670
Hey.

27:12.420 --> 27:13.540
Is everything okay?

27:13.540 --> 27:15.500
Yeah, I just, uh --

27:15.500 --> 27:18.710
I came to a doctor's
appointment.

27:18.710 --> 27:21.210
Being back here
made me think of you.

27:22.750 --> 27:23.880
Really?

27:23.880 --> 27:27.540
Because I thought
that we weren't friends.

27:27.540 --> 27:29.120
Meggy --

27:29.120 --> 27:30.790
Do you know
that Michaela and them

27:30.790 --> 27:34.620
wouldn't even talk to me
at Wes' memorial?

27:34.620 --> 27:36.120
That wasn't about you.

27:36.120 --> 27:38.790
They were just really worried
about how I lost my mind

27:38.790 --> 27:40.120
up there on the altar.

27:47.120 --> 27:48.460
I'm sorry.

27:51.120 --> 27:53.380
I just -- I miss him,
and I know that you do, too,

27:53.380 --> 27:56.040
which is why
I shouldn't have shut you out.

27:56.040 --> 27:59.040
It's just this whole situation's
made me really paranoid.

27:59.040 --> 28:01.170
Of me?

28:03.750 --> 28:05.750
Of everyone.

28:08.380 --> 28:12.540
Forgive me?

28:12.540 --> 28:14.080
The bitch is spotless.

28:14.080 --> 28:16.000
We've been through every file
we have on Atwood -- twice.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.210
There's nothing
that makes her look stupid.

28:18.210 --> 28:19.790
I couldn't track
the phone number, either.

28:19.790 --> 28:22.960
Sorry.
-Guys, what about this?

28:22.960 --> 28:25.790
It says, "Stop being a weenie
and call the mystery number"!

28:25.790 --> 28:28.120
We're not calling
the number.

28:29.460 --> 28:31.120
What about asking
your dad?

28:31.120 --> 28:32.290
No.

28:32.290 --> 28:33.710
I have an idea.

28:35.960 --> 28:39.040
There's nothing in Wes' autopsy
about the cracked rib,

28:39.040 --> 28:42.420
so you can put me on the stand,
and I'll tell the truth.

28:42.420 --> 28:44.500
It'll prove that the M.E. lied
in her report

28:44.500 --> 28:46.290
and invalidate
the D.A.'s entire case.

28:46.290 --> 28:48.250
That could make
Denver think you killed Wes.

28:48.250 --> 28:49.880
Yeah, but it'll get
Annalise off.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.790
Okay, I know you think
you have to do this, but --

28:52.790 --> 28:54.960
I want to.

28:54.960 --> 28:56.290
There's no other way.

28:58.330 --> 29:00.460
You have
to let me do this.

29:07.210 --> 29:08.960
I can't let you take
the stand.

29:08.960 --> 29:10.290
Thank God.

29:14.170 --> 29:15.250
But Laurel can, though.

29:22.460 --> 29:24.290
Mr. Gibbins' blood test showed
an abnormally high CO2 level,

29:24.290 --> 29:26.460
and I observed petechiae,

29:26.460 --> 29:28.500
which are small hemorrhages
around his cornea

29:28.500 --> 29:30.790
and on the lining
of his larynx.

29:30.790 --> 29:33.080
The presence
of those two factors led me

29:33.080 --> 29:35.080
to conclude
that Mr. Gibbins' cause of death

29:35.080 --> 29:38.540
was asphyxiation
by smoke inhalation.

29:38.540 --> 29:40.540
During your exam,
did you observe

29:40.540 --> 29:42.620
any other serious injuries
on Mr. Gibbins' body?

29:44.750 --> 29:46.380
No.

29:46.380 --> 29:47.620
Really?

29:47.620 --> 29:50.460
Nothing that would result
from a struggle or a fall?

29:50.460 --> 29:52.540
Objection --
asked and answered.

29:52.540 --> 29:55.290
Merely asking the witness
to clarify, Your Honor.

29:58.210 --> 30:01.040
Apart from the third-degree
burns sustained postmortem,

30:01.040 --> 30:03.620
I observed no other
traumatic injuries.

30:03.620 --> 30:04.960
No further questions.

30:04.960 --> 30:06.920
Mr. Denver?

30:06.920 --> 30:08.460
Nothing from our side,
Your Honor.

30:08.460 --> 30:10.120
Great, that was
the last witness on your list.

30:10.120 --> 30:12.000
Correct, Ms. Winterbottom?

30:12.000 --> 30:14.670
Actually, we have a new witness
we'd like to call to the stand.

30:14.670 --> 30:17.380
She was the other victim
in the fire -- Laurel Castillo.

30:17.380 --> 30:21.080
Objection -- Ms. Castillo is a
critical witness for the State.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.620
New evidence
about that night

30:22.620 --> 30:24.380
has come to
Ms. Castillo's recollection.

30:24.380 --> 30:26.290
The State objects,
Your Honor.

30:26.290 --> 30:28.250
I've had no time
to prepare a cross.

30:28.250 --> 30:30.580
Mr. Denver has just stated
that she is a critical witness

30:30.580 --> 30:32.500
to the State, which means
he should be prepared
to question her.

30:32.500 --> 30:34.500
I'll be prepared
for the trial.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.000
The point of this hearing
is to determine

30:36.000 --> 30:37.750
whether there will
even be a trial, Mr. Denver.

30:37.750 --> 30:39.290
Please step up,
Ms. Castillo.

30:53.670 --> 30:55.620
Why are you here?

30:55.620 --> 30:58.080
You know why.

30:58.080 --> 31:01.540
Tell me or I'll call 911
right now.

31:01.540 --> 31:03.380
How long have the Mahoneys
been paying you off?

31:03.380 --> 31:05.040
The Mahoneys?

31:05.040 --> 31:06.500
Then who asked you
to cremate Wes' body?

31:06.500 --> 31:08.250
I didn't order
his body cremated.

31:08.250 --> 31:10.620
We're not in court anymore.
No need to lie.

31:10.620 --> 31:13.210
Everything I said
under oath was true.

31:13.210 --> 31:14.330
You don't believe me,
I don't care.

31:14.330 --> 31:15.290
Why were you
in New York yesterday?

31:17.880 --> 31:19.460
You're following me now?

31:19.460 --> 31:21.290
I didn't say that.

31:21.290 --> 31:23.420
I had a job interview
with Anthony and Levin

31:23.420 --> 31:25.580
to try and salvage
what's left of my career

31:25.580 --> 31:27.210
after Annalise
destroyed it.

31:27.210 --> 31:29.580
You destroyed your career the
minute you forged my signature.

31:29.580 --> 31:33.250
And I have been kicking myself
about that ever since.

31:33.250 --> 31:36.040
I don't need
you kicking me, too.

31:36.040 --> 31:38.540
You wouldn't be in
this mess unless someone
was twisting your arm.

31:38.540 --> 31:41.500
I told you --
There is no one.

31:43.580 --> 31:45.120
Someone's gonna find out
the truth.

31:47.830 --> 31:50.420
And they might not be
as understanding as me.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.710
You're looking out
for yourself.

31:54.710 --> 31:56.210
So am I.

31:56.210 --> 31:58.170
Don't come here again.

32:03.920 --> 32:07.750
Why did you contact
the defense today, Ms. Castillo?

32:07.750 --> 32:09.920
To tell the truth.

32:09.920 --> 32:11.290
Who did you lie to?

32:11.290 --> 32:13.620
The police.

32:13.620 --> 32:16.040
Why?

32:16.040 --> 32:19.330
Because I didn't know
who I could trust.

32:19.330 --> 32:23.080
But now that I know
that the D.A. hid Wes' body,

32:23.080 --> 32:25.460
I know that I was right.

32:25.460 --> 32:29.790
What were you too afraid
to tell the police?

32:29.790 --> 32:32.540
That I saw Wes...

32:32.540 --> 32:35.420
in the house
before the fire.

32:35.420 --> 32:38.620
He was in the basement.
He was unconscious.

32:38.620 --> 32:41.960
But his body was still warm,
so I-I started CPR.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.880
For how long?

32:44.880 --> 32:48.000
A minute or more.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.880
And I kept wanting
to get him to breathe,

32:50.880 --> 32:53.420
so I just kept pressing
on his chest.

32:53.420 --> 32:55.170
Um...

32:55.170 --> 32:58.880
but then, I must've --
I must've pressed too hard,

32:58.880 --> 33:02.210
'cause then I, uh,
I heard a bone break.

33:02.210 --> 33:06.380
What you're describing is
a rib fracture, Ms. Castillo.

33:06.380 --> 33:08.120
But the medical examiner
testified

33:08.120 --> 33:09.330
that there were
no other injuries.

33:09.330 --> 33:10.670
That's a lie.

33:10.670 --> 33:12.080
-Motion to strike.
-He was dead before the fire.

33:12.080 --> 33:13.380
Why are you hiding that?

33:13.380 --> 33:14.460
Please don't
address the D.A.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.460
Why are you concealing
how he died?!

33:16.460 --> 33:19.420
Unless you want to be held
in contempt, Ms. Castillo,

33:19.420 --> 33:21.830
I'm advising you
to calm down.

33:21.830 --> 33:24.500
I'm sorry.

33:24.500 --> 33:25.500
I'm sorry.

33:27.790 --> 33:29.290
No further questions.

33:34.750 --> 33:36.540
You're a law student,
Ms. Castillo, so I assume

33:36.540 --> 33:39.710
that means you can define
"perjury" for the court?

33:42.380 --> 33:45.540
Perjury is the crime
of lying under oath.

33:45.540 --> 33:48.120
Very good.

33:48.120 --> 33:50.420
Did you learn that at
Middleton, or have you
committed perjury before?

33:52.750 --> 33:53.830
I'm not lying.

33:53.830 --> 33:55.710
Really?

33:55.710 --> 34:00.170
So, you've never lied
to legal authorities before?

34:02.170 --> 34:04.120
Hmm.

34:09.250 --> 34:12.380
Well, answer
the question.

34:12.380 --> 34:13.920
Answer the question.

34:13.920 --> 34:16.080
Objection, Your Honor.

34:16.080 --> 34:17.380
On what grounds,
Mr. Delfino?

34:17.380 --> 34:20.670
Um...

34:20.670 --> 34:23.170
I object, Your Honor,
on the grounds of hearsay.

34:23.170 --> 34:25.040
The D.A. is referring
to a supposed

34:25.040 --> 34:27.380
out-of-court statement
of which we have no proof.

34:27.380 --> 34:29.170
Here's the proof,
Your Honor.

34:29.170 --> 34:33.080
The prosecution enters
into evidence this affidavit

34:33.080 --> 34:35.420
from the Federal District
of Mexico City.

34:35.420 --> 34:39.620
It contains a statement
from Ms. Castillo confessing

34:39.620 --> 34:42.080
that she made a false claim
of kidnapping as a teenager.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.750
Objection, Your Honor.

34:43.750 --> 34:47.670
The D.A. is presenting
improper character evidence.

34:47.670 --> 34:50.830
Ms. Castillo, is this your
signature on this statement?

34:54.710 --> 34:56.750
Hm.

34:56.750 --> 34:58.540
It is.

35:01.790 --> 35:04.460
Then your objection
overruled, Ms. Winterbottom.

35:04.460 --> 35:07.040
Continue.

35:07.040 --> 35:10.460
Do you admit to fabricating
a story about getting kidnapped?

35:10.460 --> 35:11.500
I can explain.

35:11.500 --> 35:12.960
I'm not asking
for an explanation,

35:12.960 --> 35:14.580
just a yes or no.
It's not as simple as that.

35:14.580 --> 35:17.120
Did you or did you not sign
that document admitting

35:17.120 --> 35:19.040
that you lied to authorities
about getting kidnapped?

35:20.960 --> 35:22.920
Answer the question.

35:30.420 --> 35:31.750
I did.

35:36.620 --> 35:39.290
So, you're
a pathological liar?
No.

35:39.290 --> 35:40.880
Really? Because even
a sociopath couldn't lie

35:40.880 --> 35:42.420
that well on the stand.
-Seriously.

35:42.420 --> 35:44.920
I lied about seeing Wes,
not about being kidnapped.

35:44.920 --> 35:46.540
You signed
an affidavit admitting

35:46.540 --> 35:49.000
you made the whole thing up.
-Because my father made me.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.830
-I'm so confused.
-It's simple.

35:50.830 --> 35:52.460
I was really kidnapped.

35:52.460 --> 35:54.620
I just had to say I wasn't
in order to protect my father.

35:57.540 --> 35:58.790
Right.

35:58.790 --> 36:00.460
The defense requested
this hearing

36:00.460 --> 36:02.880
with the intention of proving
malicious prosecution.

36:02.880 --> 36:05.170
The only thing
they've been able to prove is

36:05.170 --> 36:08.420
to what extraordinary --
and illegal -- lengths

36:08.420 --> 36:10.830
they're willing to go
to have these charges dropped.

36:10.830 --> 36:14.330
Now, although the cremation
of the victim's body was

36:14.330 --> 36:17.250
an egregious clerical error,
the official autopsy results

36:17.250 --> 36:19.670
prove that the fire was
the cause of death --

36:19.670 --> 36:22.380
a fire started
by Ms. Keating in her own home.

36:22.380 --> 36:25.000
And the only person
to refute the findings was

36:25.000 --> 36:26.750
one of her own students
who we now know has

36:26.750 --> 36:28.620
a history of perjury.

36:28.620 --> 36:30.120
And let's not forget
the evidence

36:30.120 --> 36:31.750
against Ms. Keating,
that Mr. Gibbins was

36:31.750 --> 36:34.620
about to take an immunity deal
incriminating her.

36:34.620 --> 36:36.830
Ms. Keating instructed
Mr. Gibbins to go to her house

36:36.830 --> 36:39.330
hours before he was killed.

36:39.330 --> 36:42.710
Then she erased
her cellphone?

36:42.710 --> 36:44.120
We even have
an anonymous source

36:44.120 --> 36:46.040
who's willing to testify
as to her motives.

36:46.040 --> 36:48.500
Whose identity is
still being hidden from us.

36:48.500 --> 36:51.500
We will reveal the identity
as we get closer to the trial.

36:51.500 --> 36:55.750
Either way, this case deserves
to go before a jury.

36:55.750 --> 36:58.080
At the very least,
we owe that to Mr. Gibbins.

36:58.080 --> 37:00.540
There's no need
to delay my decision.

37:00.540 --> 37:03.120
Your Honor, I urge you
to take more time

37:03.120 --> 37:04.830
with the facts
of this hearing.

37:04.830 --> 37:07.210
More time won't change
my decision.

37:07.210 --> 37:09.330
While it's true
that A.D.A. Atwood engaged

37:09.330 --> 37:12.210
in heinous misconduct,
it doesn't cancel out

37:12.210 --> 37:15.000
the abundance of evidence
against Ms. Keating.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
Defense's motion
to dismiss is denied.

37:26.710 --> 37:28.960
Well, that was
a big waste of time.

37:28.960 --> 37:30.250
You think?

37:36.670 --> 37:38.080
I'm sorry.

37:42.710 --> 37:44.170
Not now, Janice.

37:45.500 --> 37:47.710
It's not Janice.

37:51.330 --> 37:52.750
Why are you here,
Mr. Walsh?

37:54.670 --> 37:57.120
I want Wes' immunity deal.

38:05.120 --> 38:06.960
- Connor?
- He's probably just dropping

38:06.960 --> 38:08.460
a mean one
in the bathroom.

38:08.460 --> 38:11.500
Or he just finally went
to Russia.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.210
Okay, you do not still get
to be mad at him.

38:13.210 --> 38:15.500
Oh, I get to be mad at him
for the rest of my life.

38:15.500 --> 38:16.830
- He's not in there.

38:16.830 --> 38:17.920
Please don't do this.
Please.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.420
Please. Please.

38:19.420 --> 38:21.830
-Hey.
-Connor?

38:21.830 --> 38:23.670
-Where the hell is he?
-Where the hell are you?

38:23.670 --> 38:25.290
Denver's office.

38:25.290 --> 38:26.750
What?

38:26.750 --> 38:30.750
I'll file for bifurcation
from Frank first thing tomorrow.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.880
Wait for me in your car.

38:36.920 --> 38:38.580
Tell him
he has to get out of there!

38:38.580 --> 38:40.290
God!
Are you insane?!

38:40.290 --> 38:41.170
Don't worry.
I'm gonna fix this.

38:41.170 --> 38:42.790
How?

38:42.790 --> 38:45.960
By telling the truth --
that Laurel told my story.

38:45.960 --> 38:47.080
No, Connor --

38:47.080 --> 38:49.040
It's the least I can do
at this point.

38:49.040 --> 38:51.380
No, it's the dumbest thing
you can do at this point.

38:51.380 --> 38:52.790
All he's gonna do is think
that you're lying --

38:52.790 --> 38:54.540
o-or worse,
that you're a suspect!

38:54.540 --> 38:56.540
Don't worry.
I'm getting an immunity deal.

38:56.540 --> 38:57.750
He's having it drafted
right now.

38:57.750 --> 38:59.250
So, he's not there?

38:59.250 --> 39:01.420
-No.
-Then leave, please.

39:01.420 --> 39:03.790
We all get it now,
that you feel bad, even Laurel.

39:03.790 --> 39:05.710
Say you're not mad at him.
-I forgive you, Connor.

39:05.710 --> 39:07.330
So, please, Connor,
just come home!

39:09.080 --> 39:12.120

for a job interview.
