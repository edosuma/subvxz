WEBVTT

00:13.013 --> 00:15.765
<i>How well</i>
<i>do we really know our parents?</i>

00:16.391 --> 00:17.684
<i>Take my father.</i>

00:17.767 --> 00:20.061
<i>I've always considered him an open book.</i>

00:20.562 --> 00:24.232
<i>A man given to misguided schemes</i>
<i>and exaggerated displays of affection.</i>

00:25.358 --> 00:26.693
<i>But when he was a student,</i>

00:26.776 --> 00:29.487
<i>he was accused of a murder</i>
<i>that took place right up there.</i>

00:30.488 --> 00:31.740
<i>Which leads me to wonder…</i>

00:37.537 --> 00:41.207
<i>…what really happened</i>
<i>that stormy night 32 years ago?</i>

01:01.936 --> 01:05.398
I think he had a sword,
and they certainly have issues.

01:06.941 --> 01:09.069
I don't like to tell tales,
Sheriff Walker,

01:09.569 --> 01:11.404
but it's all Morticia Frump's fault.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.782
They were fighting over her.

01:20.038 --> 01:20.997
Tish…

01:21.498 --> 01:22.999
I don't know what to say, Gomez.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.794
Seeing you in handcuffs,
accused of murder…

01:27.378 --> 01:28.755
I've never loved you more.

01:28.838 --> 01:29.964
<i>Cara mia.</i>

01:30.048 --> 01:32.008
All right, that's enough, Addams.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.093
Let's go.

01:36.888 --> 01:39.557
-Let's move it out. Let's get going.

02:10.088 --> 02:13.424
Ah, the fetid air of teenage angst.

02:13.508 --> 02:16.636
These were the best years of our lives,
were they not, Tish?

02:16.719 --> 02:19.389
They certainly were, <i>mi cariño</i>.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.435
I hope Wednesday's happy to see us.

02:25.186 --> 02:28.565
I left a dozen messages
on her crystal ball. Still no reply.

02:29.357 --> 02:31.276
Fret not, my plum-lipped cupid.

02:31.776 --> 02:34.112
I'm sure she's dying to see us.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.448
Mmm.

02:37.532 --> 02:38.950
Come on, let's go.

02:47.542 --> 02:51.462
Nevermore was created
as a safe haven for our children

02:51.546 --> 02:53.756
to learn and to grow,

02:53.840 --> 02:56.259
no matter who or what they are.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.101
I realize most of you have heard about

03:05.185 --> 03:08.563
the unfortunate incident
involving one of our students.

03:08.646 --> 03:11.441
But I'm happy to report
that Eugene is on the mend

03:11.524 --> 03:13.735
and is expected to make a full recovery.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.987
So let's focus on the positive

03:16.070 --> 03:19.574
and make this Parents' Weekend
our very best yet.

03:22.577 --> 03:23.578
On the mend?

03:24.537 --> 03:25.747
Try in a coma.

03:26.414 --> 03:27.582
Have you been to see him?

03:28.625 --> 03:31.461
-You're his friend.
-I'm the reason he's in the hospital.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.379
That is not your fault, okay?

03:33.963 --> 03:36.925
The monster hasn't attacked anyone
in the past week.

03:37.008 --> 03:38.676
Maybe you finally scared it off.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.262
Or maybe it went into hiding
to avoid this weekend.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.974
Look at this.
Some things never change.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.479
I knew I should have worn my plague mask.

03:51.105 --> 03:52.649
Would you look at my family?

03:52.732 --> 03:55.193
-Talk about toxic pack mentality.

03:55.276 --> 03:58.529
I give my mom 30 seconds
before her judge-y claws come out.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.283
Let's get this over with.

04:06.412 --> 04:08.122
There she is.

04:08.206 --> 04:11.459
Oh, how we missed those
accusing eyes and youthful sneer.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.922
How are you, my little rain cloud?

04:16.005 --> 04:18.633
I thought Thing was filling you in
on my every move.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.553
I uncovered your feeble subterfuge
almost immediately.

04:24.055 --> 04:25.890
So, how's the little fella doing?

04:26.766 --> 04:28.851
Does he still have all his fingers?

04:28.935 --> 04:31.771
Relax. I haven't snapped
any of his digits.

04:31.854 --> 04:32.772
Yet.

04:33.606 --> 04:35.233
So tell us everything.

04:35.900 --> 04:39.070
Since you've abandoned me here,
I've been hunted, haunted…

04:40.947 --> 04:42.865
and the target of an attempted murder.

04:43.783 --> 04:47.120
Ah, Nevermore. I love you so.

04:47.787 --> 04:48.913
Enid.

04:48.997 --> 04:52.500
Oh, let me look at you.

04:52.583 --> 04:56.212
-One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand…
-Have you not been waxing?

04:56.296 --> 04:59.340
Three seconds. That's a personal best.

05:01.259 --> 05:04.262
Are you feeling well?
You're looking a touch anemic.

05:04.345 --> 05:06.472
Have you been eating enough red meat?

05:07.724 --> 05:09.600
It's good to see you too, Mom.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.019
And you, Dad.

05:18.026 --> 05:21.154
Not sure how much more of this
family togetherness I can take.

05:22.155 --> 05:25.867
Think you skipped where you apologize
for acting like a jerk last weekend.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.953
I'm sorry for what happened at the dance.

05:29.787 --> 05:32.248
I shouldn't have asked you
to siren-song me like that.

05:36.252 --> 05:38.629
Guessing your dad's
a no-show again this year?

05:38.713 --> 05:39.672
Yeah.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.800
I got a text this morning. You?

05:44.135 --> 05:46.763
Gabrielle hasn't shown her face
since I started here.

05:47.722 --> 05:50.558
Probably sunning herself
somewhere in the Seychelles.

05:50.641 --> 05:52.518
My darling daughter.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.481
I made it.

05:57.065 --> 05:59.150
Wouldn't miss this for the world.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.070
I guess you misjudged her.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.789
Our old yearbook.

06:13.498 --> 06:17.085
I haven't laid eyes on this
in over 20 years.

06:17.168 --> 06:20.213
Such good times we had,
didn't we, Larissa?

06:21.047 --> 06:22.840
Some of us better than others.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.884
Oh, don't be so modest.

06:24.967 --> 06:28.012
You always filled a room
with your presence.

06:28.596 --> 06:31.224
Like a stately sequoia tree.

06:31.724 --> 06:34.727
And I guess that would make you
the lumberjack.

06:35.603 --> 06:40.400
There's that biting
sense of humor that I always adored.

06:42.235 --> 06:46.697
Do you remember when we did that duet
for the Solstice Talent Show?

06:47.198 --> 06:50.910
Your Judy Garland impression
was a dead ringer.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.038
Sounds positively suicidal.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.290
Oh.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.252
My picture's gone.

06:59.335 --> 07:01.504
Really? Well, that is odd.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.382
May I borrow this for the weekend?

07:05.174 --> 07:08.511
That way Gomez and I can take
a little walk down memory lane.

07:08.594 --> 07:09.679
Rawr.

07:10.888 --> 07:11.931
All right.

07:12.014 --> 07:14.809
Let's get down
to the matter at hand, shall we? Hmm?

07:16.811 --> 07:21.858
Unfortunately, Wednesday's
assimilation has been rocky at best.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.693
Because I refuse to embrace

07:23.776 --> 07:26.904
the culture of dishonesty
and denial permeating this school.

07:27.405 --> 07:30.324
Starting with the monster that
killed Rowan and put Eugene in the ICU.

07:30.908 --> 07:34.120
Although I do hear he's on the mend.

07:34.203 --> 07:37.165
We've always encouraged Wednesday
to speak her mind.

07:37.248 --> 07:40.543
Sometimes her sharp tongue can cut deep.

07:40.626 --> 07:44.255
Apparently her therapist feels
she hasn't been very open to the process.

07:44.338 --> 07:47.300
Their time together has not yielded
the results we'd hoped.

07:47.383 --> 07:48.301
I'm not a lab rat.

07:49.385 --> 07:52.346
Dr. Kinbott and I have spoken,
and we both agree

07:52.430 --> 07:57.268
it would be most beneficial for you all
to attend a family session this weekend.

07:57.351 --> 07:58.269
No.

07:58.978 --> 08:02.857
I thought that might be your reaction,
but your parents can see the wisdom in it.

08:02.940 --> 08:07.737
Um, not to side with Wednesday,
but, um, we're only here for the weekend.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.448
Oh, come on.

08:10.531 --> 08:12.158
What can it hurt? To be honest,

08:12.241 --> 08:15.578
I've always been a big fan
of head-shrinking.

08:15.661 --> 08:18.414
It's not that kind of head-shrinking,
<i>mon chéri.</i>

08:19.499 --> 08:20.541
Well,

08:21.584 --> 08:23.044
that is disappointing.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.004
But anything for our little girl.

08:25.087 --> 08:26.088
Ah.

08:34.472 --> 08:35.431
Yeah.

08:36.057 --> 08:39.018
You make sure they search that cave
for any sign of that creature.

08:39.101 --> 08:42.855
No stone unturned.
They bag and tag everything, all right?

08:44.357 --> 08:47.860
And then follow up with the lab.
I want the DNA results on that claw.

08:48.861 --> 08:51.948
We already got one kid in the ICU,
a bunch of people in the morgue.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.366
I don't want any more.

08:55.785 --> 08:56.619
All right.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.376
Son of a bitch.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.087
What's wrong?

09:06.170 --> 09:09.590
Just hard to stomach a murderer
wandering around town scot-free.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.637
At least they care enough
about Wednesday to go to therapy with her.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.181
Tyler, come on. We've been through this.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.724
I'm just… I'm not comfortable

09:18.808 --> 09:21.394
dredging up the family past
with some complete stranger.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.230
Think it's easy for me to sit there
and talk about my crap?

09:24.313 --> 09:27.316
-I've got a lot on my plate now, bud.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.197
You got the results already?

09:35.366 --> 09:37.868
All right. Tape off the scene.
I'll be right there.

09:39.161 --> 09:41.539
Dad. You okay? What's going on?

09:43.791 --> 09:45.793
You know Reggie, the local coroner?

09:47.545 --> 09:49.130
He just blew his brains out.

10:02.393 --> 10:04.687
So, who wants to start?

10:07.940 --> 10:11.235
Maybe we can discuss what it's like
having Wednesday away from home?

10:15.197 --> 10:17.158
I mean, for me…

10:17.241 --> 10:21.412
…it's been hard
not having Wednesday around.

10:22.663 --> 10:25.708
I never thought I'd miss
being waterboarded so much.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.212
Morticia, Gomez.

10:30.963 --> 10:34.300
-How have you been coping?
-It's been torture for us too.

10:34.884 --> 10:38.220
Fortunately,
my brother Fester's rack fits two people.

10:38.763 --> 10:42.642
Nothing like a good stretch
to bring out the best in each other.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.393
<i>Querida mía.</i>

10:46.520 --> 10:47.521
Um…

10:49.649 --> 10:50.816
Enough!

10:53.694 --> 10:55.988
I think it's high time
my parents faced the music.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.158
It seems they've been lying to me.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.243
Keeping secrets.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.871
Murderous secrets
that need to be addressed.

11:07.208 --> 11:10.127
Who was Garrett Gates,
and why are you accused of murdering him?

11:10.211 --> 11:11.462
Whoa.

11:11.545 --> 11:14.674
Those charges were dropped.
Your father is an innocent man.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.842
Local sheriff doesn't seem too convinced.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.886
Wednesday, stop.

11:18.969 --> 11:21.430
This is neither the time nor the place.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.016
Actually, this is exactly the place.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.395
-These sessions are--
-Doctor. This does not concern you.

11:27.937 --> 11:31.649
And I refuse to debate a decades-old
witch-hunt with you right now.

11:31.732 --> 11:33.526
-I--
-Darling, maybe we should--

11:33.609 --> 11:35.820
No. This session is over.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.571
Have it your way, Mother.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.990
-Wednes… Wednesday?
-If you refuse to tell me the truth,

11:40.074 --> 11:42.076
I'll just have to excavate it myself.

11:44.036 --> 11:44.954
You…

11:47.581 --> 11:49.583
Thanks for the candy.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.170
Actually, that's potpourri.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.090
Why don't you take the bowl?

12:03.180 --> 12:04.724
What were you thinking?

12:05.391 --> 12:08.811
How could you ambush
your father like that? Wednesday.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.772
How could I?
You insisted I go to this school.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.024
Did you really think
I wouldn't find out your secret?

12:14.108 --> 12:17.111
You don't know the full story.
Your father did nothing wrong.

12:17.194 --> 12:18.320
I'll be the judge of that.

12:26.620 --> 12:27.663
Potpourri?

12:30.207 --> 12:31.709
-Mmm!

12:34.086 --> 12:35.171
How did you find me?

12:35.254 --> 12:37.923
MorningSong community misses you.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.425
I miss you.

12:39.508 --> 12:41.719
And by community, you mean cult?

12:41.802 --> 12:44.180
We are a personal development movement

12:44.263 --> 12:46.515
that helps people
take control of their lives.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.350
After you take control
of their bank accounts.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.895
I haven't come here to fight, Brandy Jane.

12:50.978 --> 12:52.396
My name is Bianca.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.064
New name. New life.

12:54.148 --> 12:55.441
It's time to come home.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.234
That place was never my home.

12:57.318 --> 13:00.988
-Gideon said you'd resist.
-Don't say that man's name to me.

13:01.071 --> 13:03.866
You think he'd give a damn about
some single mom and her daughter

13:03.949 --> 13:05.367
-if we weren't sirens?

13:05.451 --> 13:08.996
That is no way to talk
about your stepfather.

13:09.705 --> 13:11.290
You actually married him.

13:11.373 --> 13:15.211
He wants you to come home,
so that we can be a real family.

13:15.920 --> 13:16.837
Hard pass.

13:17.421 --> 13:19.256
He's already got one siren
to do his bidding.

13:20.883 --> 13:21.967
Goodbye, Ma.

13:22.927 --> 13:26.472
I don't want to see more MorningSong
bracelets anywhere near this town.

13:27.556 --> 13:29.600
My siren song is drying up.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.103
Recruitment numbers are down,

13:33.187 --> 13:36.190
and the wrong people
are starting to ask questions.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.777
This wasn't a request.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.029
And if I refuse?

13:44.657 --> 13:49.328
Then everybody here is gonna know
how you siren'd your way into Nevermore.

13:49.411 --> 13:52.498
I finally make something of myself
and you want to destroy it.

13:52.581 --> 13:55.084
You haven't made squat, <i>Bianca.</i>

13:56.710 --> 13:58.462
You're just scamming
a higher class of people,

13:58.546 --> 13:59.964
but they are not your friends.

14:01.048 --> 14:03.759
Sooner or later they will see through you.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.763
A siren can never change her scales.

14:09.640 --> 14:13.143
You got until the end of the weekend
to say your goodbyes.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.736
I harvested hive number three.

14:24.363 --> 14:25.865
The bees miss you, Eugene.

14:28.534 --> 14:29.493
We all do.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.582
Thanks for keeping an eye on him.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.418
Any updates?

14:40.004 --> 14:41.547
He didn't deserve this.

14:43.424 --> 14:44.633
I should be in that bed.

14:45.843 --> 14:47.595
Why did you go without me?

14:49.638 --> 14:52.933
-Didn't mean to startle you, dear.
-You must be Wednesday.

14:53.517 --> 14:56.270
Eugene's moms. Sue and Janet.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.188
You were all he could talk about lately.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.816
He was so happy you joined the Hummers.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.236
Eugene hasn't had the easiest time
fitting in at Nevermore.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.281
He was so excited
to finally make a real friend.

15:07.781 --> 15:09.074
I brought him some honey.

15:09.158 --> 15:12.536
Eugene loves those dang bees
like they're his kids.

15:13.829 --> 15:15.581
His fuzzy-buzzy babies.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.960
He's gonna be okay, right?

15:20.044 --> 15:21.211
I should go.

15:36.644 --> 15:39.563
First time someone's
killed themselves in the morgue.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.607
Guys don't know what to do with the body.

15:41.690 --> 15:45.152
-What do you got?
-Gun was legal and registered in his name.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.445
Colt .45.

15:46.528 --> 15:48.364
Janitor said he kept it in his desk.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.157
I just saw Doc last week.

15:50.699 --> 15:54.244
He was planning a cruise with his wife.
He seemed excited all about retirement.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.622
Guess you never know
what's going through someone's mind.

15:56.705 --> 15:59.875
A bullet, apparently.
We got security footage?

16:00.459 --> 16:03.170
Nope. Camera was obscured.
Black bubblegum.

16:03.837 --> 16:07.174
I got them scrubbing through video
to find out how long it's been there.

16:07.257 --> 16:08.884
Black bubblegum.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.178
You don't say…

16:12.221 --> 16:17.101
The suicide note says
he felt guilty about an old case.

16:17.184 --> 16:20.104
Says he covered it up,
faked the coroner's report,

16:20.187 --> 16:22.815
and has been living with guilt
for all these years.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.150
What case?

16:25.234 --> 16:26.527
Uh, Garrett Gates.

16:27.861 --> 16:29.446
Garrett Gates. You gotta be kidding me.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.031
You heard of it?

16:31.115 --> 16:33.242
I've been waiting 30 years
to put away his murderer.

16:33.909 --> 16:35.244
You know who did it?

16:35.327 --> 16:37.371
There's only ever been one suspect.

16:37.454 --> 16:40.290
I always thought
they were covering up the truth.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.252
Now I got my proof.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.703
Mmm. I am famished.

18:03.999 --> 18:06.001
You're not hungry, darling?

18:06.085 --> 18:08.003
My appetite eludes me, Mother.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.839
The same way the truth eludes you.

18:19.723 --> 18:21.100
We need to tell her.

18:23.143 --> 18:25.229
She'll never believe us.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.940
We must stay strong.

18:30.442 --> 18:34.738
And hope that something more morbid
comes along to distract her.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.961
So are you going to make me ask?

18:49.878 --> 18:53.298
Ajax and I haven't defined
our relationship yet.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.342
I'm not talking about boys.

18:55.425 --> 18:57.469
Have you wolfed out yet?

19:02.015 --> 19:02.975
No.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.936
Well, that is a disappointment.

19:07.354 --> 19:08.397
That's me.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.358
A huge disappointment.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.414
Can I ask what this is about, Sheriff?

19:26.206 --> 19:28.167
What's happening, Ms. Thornhill?

19:28.250 --> 19:29.585
I have no idea.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.086
Gomez Addams.

19:35.591 --> 19:36.884
How can I help you, Sheriff?

19:36.967 --> 19:40.012
You're under arrest
for the murder of Garrett Gates.

19:40.095 --> 19:41.555
You have the right to remain silent.

19:41.638 --> 19:44.933
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

19:45.017 --> 19:45.851
Dad?

19:46.393 --> 19:48.270
You have the right to an attorney.

19:48.353 --> 19:51.106
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed for you.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.807
My little <i>tormenta</i>, how's your mother?

20:25.891 --> 20:28.268
Devastated. She hates you in orange.

20:29.269 --> 20:31.980
I caught her laying a rose on a grave
earlier today.

20:32.981 --> 20:35.234
The headstone read "Garrett Gates."

20:35.317 --> 20:37.903
The very boy
you've been arrested for murdering.

20:39.363 --> 20:40.572
Care to explain?

20:45.244 --> 20:47.829
Garrett was infatuated with your mother.

20:48.664 --> 20:51.750
He mistook her kindness for interest.

20:52.334 --> 20:55.462
His infatuation turned into obsession,

20:56.046 --> 20:57.714
and he started stalking her.

20:57.798 --> 21:00.008
-Why didn't you call the police?
-We tried.

21:00.634 --> 21:03.303
But his family were
the oldest and richest in Jericho.

21:03.387 --> 21:05.013
No one believed us.

21:05.847 --> 21:09.142
Garrett's father, an outcast-hating bigot,

21:09.226 --> 21:12.145
was furious that your mother
had accused his only son.

21:13.188 --> 21:16.316
<i>It all came to a head</i>
<i>the night of the Rave'N Dance.</i>

21:18.402 --> 21:20.946
<i>Your mother and I stepped out</i>
<i>to catch our breath.</i>

21:28.370 --> 21:29.955
Addams!

21:30.038 --> 21:32.040
And that's when I saw him.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.543
He had broken into the school.

21:35.043 --> 21:38.213
His twisted love for your mother
had made him insane.

21:38.714 --> 21:43.427
His eyes bore into me,
brimming with murderous intent.

21:44.011 --> 21:46.263
Go. Get out of here. He won't hurt me.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.473
Garrett, no!

21:48.557 --> 21:50.559
Garrett, stop!

21:58.900 --> 22:01.236
My life flashed before my eyes.

22:02.070 --> 22:06.491
<i>Driven by jealousy and hate,</i>
<i>Garrett was unstoppable.</i>

22:30.724 --> 22:32.225
<i>When I saw the sword,</i>

22:33.143 --> 22:35.520
<i>my survival instinct kicked in.</i>

22:41.026 --> 22:44.029
<i>It was a terrible accident.</i>

23:06.259 --> 23:10.097
<i>If I'm being objective,</i>
<i>his confession sounds entirely plausible,</i>

23:10.180 --> 23:12.891
<i>delivered with</i>
<i>the perfect degree of sincerity.</i>

23:12.974 --> 23:15.227
<i>Perhaps my father is exactly what he says.</i>

23:15.310 --> 23:17.145
Thank you for being honest with me.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.484
<i>But then there's the matter of his tells.</i>

23:22.567 --> 23:25.070
<i>The way he smooths his mustache.</i>

23:25.153 --> 23:27.406
<i>The way he delivers a comforting wink.</i>

23:28.156 --> 23:31.159
<i>I've been playing Russian roulette</i>
<i>with him since I was 12.</i>

23:31.660 --> 23:32.828
<i>I know them well.</i>

23:33.537 --> 23:36.248
I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.

23:36.331 --> 23:39.251
Could we please do without
the overt display of emotion?

23:39.960 --> 23:42.045
I know they make you feel uncomfortable.

23:43.505 --> 23:46.299
How many fathers hand their daughter
a fencing blade when she's five?

23:47.259 --> 23:50.137
Your saber strokes
were an essay in perfection.

23:50.220 --> 23:52.055
Or teach her how to swim with sharks?

23:52.139 --> 23:55.016
They found you as cold-blooded as I do.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.018
The right way to flay a rattlesnake?

23:57.102 --> 23:59.938
They really do taste like chicken
when prepared properly.

24:00.522 --> 24:03.733
The point is, you taught me
how to be strong and independent.

24:04.359 --> 24:07.654
How to navigate myself in a world
full of treachery and prejudice.

24:08.864 --> 24:11.741
You are the reason
I understand how imperative it is

24:11.825 --> 24:13.785
that I never lose sight of myself.

24:16.455 --> 24:20.083
So as far as fatherhood goes, I would say
you've been more than adequate.

24:23.712 --> 24:25.255
<i>Gracias,</i> Wednesday.

24:30.969 --> 24:32.387
We need to talk.

24:34.514 --> 24:35.932
How the hell did you get in?

24:37.017 --> 24:39.269
Bernice? Bernice!

24:39.352 --> 24:42.314
Bernice may or may not have received
a call that her tabby cat Swifty

24:42.397 --> 24:43.648
is being held for ransom.

24:44.566 --> 24:46.985
My father did not kill Garrett Gates.

24:47.861 --> 24:49.738
Well, I have his signed confession,

24:49.821 --> 24:51.948
and he identified
the saber he used to do it.

24:52.032 --> 24:54.326
Both of which I'm about to deliver
to the District Attorney.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.953
Don't you find the timing convenient?

24:57.454 --> 25:00.624
The coroner kills himself out of remorse
for a decades-old murder case

25:00.707 --> 25:03.710
the very weekend my father,
your prime suspect,

25:03.793 --> 25:04.794
deigns to return to town.

25:05.462 --> 25:08.632
All I see is a guilty man
who's finally going to pay for his crime.

25:09.132 --> 25:12.636
And cuffing him myself,
oh, that was the icing on the cake.

25:12.719 --> 25:14.888
How are you failing to see that someone is

25:14.971 --> 25:17.140
desperately trying
to derail my investigation?

25:17.224 --> 25:20.727
I found the monster's cave,
and I gave you the DNA evidence.

25:20.810 --> 25:22.395
Did you even bother to test it?

25:22.479 --> 25:25.690
This may come as a shock,
but the world doesn't revolve around you.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.944
Here. DNA results.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.613
No match. Inconclusive.

25:31.696 --> 25:34.533
So you truly believe
this is all some coincidence?

25:35.116 --> 25:37.661
Whoever hurt Eugene
also murdered the coroner.

25:37.744 --> 25:40.747
Unfortunately, someone sabotaged
the security camera in the morgue,

25:40.830 --> 25:42.374
so we don't know what happened.

25:42.457 --> 25:44.000
They stuck bubblegum on the lens.

25:44.584 --> 25:46.169
Black bubblegum.

25:47.420 --> 25:49.005
Maybe I should run DNA on that?

25:49.089 --> 25:52.551
Someone is trying to throw me
off my game. This is all a distraction.

25:52.634 --> 25:55.762
No, this is about justice being served.

25:55.845 --> 25:57.722
Garrett Gates's family deserves closure,

25:58.306 --> 26:00.892
even if none of them
are around to take comfort in it.

26:01.434 --> 26:02.477
What happened to them?

26:02.561 --> 26:04.145
His mother hung herself in the backyard.

26:04.229 --> 26:06.022
His father drank himself
to an early grave.

26:06.106 --> 26:07.983
Even his little sister didn't escape.

26:08.650 --> 26:12.362
She was orphaned,
sent overseas, ended up drowning.

26:13.071 --> 26:14.447
Every last one of them's gone.

26:15.156 --> 26:17.492
Your father doesn't just have
Garrett's blood on his hands,

26:17.576 --> 26:19.452
he's got the whole damn family's.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.597
Here. I brought you a gift.

26:39.389 --> 26:42.601
That's so sweet.
You didn't have to get me anything.

26:42.684 --> 26:47.772
I know, but I thought we got off
on the wrong foot this weekend.

26:48.481 --> 26:52.360
I just want you to know
that all I want is the very best for you.

27:07.959 --> 27:08.960
What are these?

27:09.419 --> 27:10.545
Brochures.

27:11.379 --> 27:12.589
For summer camp.

27:12.672 --> 27:15.050
These aren't just ordinary summer camps.

27:16.301 --> 27:18.553
These are camps
for lycanthropy conversion.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.389
Oh, no need to be dramatic, Enid.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.933
You want to send me
to conversion therapy for werewolves?

27:24.017 --> 27:26.853
It worked wonders
for your cousin Lucille, didn't it?

27:27.646 --> 27:29.689
Seven weeks in the Balkan countryside

27:29.773 --> 27:32.525
and she was
howling at the moon in no time.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.235
As it should be.

27:34.319 --> 27:38.239
Don't you want to wolf out
and finally be normal, honey?

27:50.960 --> 27:51.961
Go away.

27:53.046 --> 27:54.756
You forgot your fishing gear.

28:03.556 --> 28:05.016
Stop trying to be nice.

28:05.975 --> 28:07.018
It doesn't suit you.

28:08.269 --> 28:09.813
Father packed your favorite bait.

28:27.831 --> 28:29.582
What'll happen to him now?

28:30.333 --> 28:32.794
Well, he's confessed,
so there won't be a trial.

28:33.878 --> 28:36.423
After he's sentenced,
he'll be sent to a state penitentiary,

28:36.506 --> 28:39.384
where he'll lose his mind
being separated from Mother.

28:41.219 --> 28:44.389
Did you know they haven't spent
a night apart since they tied the knot?

28:45.306 --> 28:48.184
I always thought I'd be the first one
in the family behind bars.

28:48.268 --> 28:50.186
Lurch and I had a bet going.

28:54.023 --> 28:56.651
Come on. Let's see if the fish are biting.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.621
That's quite a catch.

29:10.081 --> 29:11.499
I'm gonna miss him, Wednesday.

29:11.583 --> 29:14.127
It's not over yet. He's innocent.

29:15.211 --> 29:16.045
Well,

29:16.963 --> 29:19.466
if anyone can figure out
who really committed the crime…

29:21.468 --> 29:22.302
it's you.

29:22.385 --> 29:25.513
You have to find out the truth
and free Dad.

29:25.597 --> 29:28.975
Well, until that happens,
we both know Mother will be falling apart.

29:31.019 --> 29:32.896
Which means we have to be strong.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.440
And by "we," I mean you.

29:38.818 --> 29:40.904
Now, give me one of those.

29:55.084 --> 29:56.544
Where is Mother anyway?

29:57.504 --> 29:59.506
She said she wanted to be alone.

29:59.589 --> 30:01.549
Somewhere where no one would find her.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.189
Hello, Mother.

30:19.692 --> 30:20.819
Hello, Wednesday.

30:22.028 --> 30:24.072
So you're a Nightshade.

30:24.155 --> 30:25.698
That didn't take long.

30:25.782 --> 30:27.742
Actually, I rejected them.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.869
Why? Because I was a member?

30:29.953 --> 30:31.913
I'll never live up to your legacy here,

30:32.956 --> 30:33.915
so why try?

30:35.083 --> 30:37.502
I win the Poe Cup,
you claimed it four times.

30:38.002 --> 30:40.129
I join the fencing team, you captained it.

30:42.048 --> 30:45.093
Why would you send me somewhere
I could only ever exist in your shadow?

30:46.386 --> 30:48.346
It's not a competition, Wednesday.

30:48.429 --> 30:50.640
Everything is a competition, Mother.

30:52.016 --> 30:55.228
But mostly I rejected them
because they're a trivial social club.

30:55.311 --> 30:57.063
We used to be so much more.

30:58.523 --> 31:02.151
Our mission was to protect outcasts
from harm and bigotry.

31:03.611 --> 31:08.324
In fact, the group was started by
an ancestor of your father's from Mexico.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.077
One of the first settlers in America.

31:11.160 --> 31:12.161
Goody.

31:14.247 --> 31:15.915
I saw her painting at Pilgrim World.

31:17.417 --> 31:18.418
Oh.

31:20.086 --> 31:23.756
How ironic, since she was the one
who killed Joseph Crackstone.

31:24.966 --> 31:29.512
The Nightshades were her secret,
but deadly, answer to his oppression.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.767
I know why you've come here, Wednesday.

31:36.936 --> 31:38.646
So go on. Ask.

31:40.607 --> 31:43.109
Father didn't kill Garrett Gates, did he?

31:45.778 --> 31:46.613
No.

31:50.366 --> 31:52.452
<i>By the time</i>
<i>I made it up the stairs,</i>

31:52.535 --> 31:56.164
<i>I found your father fighting for his life.</i>
<i>It was terrifying.</i>

31:56.956 --> 31:57.832
Garrett, no!

32:08.176 --> 32:09.510
Garrett!

32:09.594 --> 32:10.678
Garrett, stop!

32:10.762 --> 32:11.888
Leave him alone!

32:18.937 --> 32:21.481
I'll never forget the way he looked at me.

32:23.107 --> 32:25.902
<i>He was even foaming at the mouth.</i>

32:27.654 --> 32:31.950
It was like I was staring
into the eyes of a rabid beast.

32:49.550 --> 32:50.551
Oh, no.

32:57.141 --> 32:58.935
<i>It was only</i>
<i>when I heard the scream</i>

32:59.018 --> 33:00.645
<i>that I realized what I'd done.</i>

33:02.647 --> 33:04.148
<i>Your father was so…</i>

33:06.150 --> 33:08.111
<i>calm and brave.</i>

33:17.829 --> 33:20.540
Tish, you need to leave right now.

33:20.623 --> 33:22.542
Go to your room and lock the door.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.293
You were never here.

33:24.377 --> 33:26.170
-You understand me?

33:26.754 --> 33:28.297
Morticia?

33:29.757 --> 33:31.592
Put this back on the table.

33:32.677 --> 33:33.803
-Go.
-Okay.

33:39.475 --> 33:42.854
Your father took the blame
in order to protect me.

33:47.567 --> 33:50.737
I was so grateful
when they cleared him of any wrongdoing.

33:50.820 --> 33:52.196
But I knew,

33:53.489 --> 33:56.200
someday this would come back to haunt us.

34:01.164 --> 34:03.541
You said Garrett was foaming at the mouth.

34:03.624 --> 34:05.334
His eyes didn't look human.

34:06.586 --> 34:10.173
I've never seen someone
so blinded by rage.

34:10.715 --> 34:12.133
Maybe it wasn't rage at all.

34:12.925 --> 34:16.137
Foaming saliva,
dilated pupils, mental confusion.

34:16.220 --> 34:18.681
What are those all textbook symptoms of?

34:25.271 --> 34:26.689
But how can that be?

34:27.732 --> 34:29.525
There's only one way to find out.

34:32.737 --> 34:37.408
This reminds me of when
you got your first grave-digging kit.

34:37.492 --> 34:39.827
You were so happy, you nearly smiled.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.663
Are you sure you don't want to join?

34:43.247 --> 34:45.792
Uh… mm… No, that's okay, darling.

34:45.875 --> 34:47.460
I don't want to spoil your fun.

35:00.431 --> 35:01.641
Moment of truth.

35:09.524 --> 35:10.691
Hello, Garrett.

35:12.652 --> 35:13.569
I was right.

35:14.654 --> 35:17.323
Well, well,
what do we have here?

35:19.075 --> 35:21.369
Guess there's gonna be
an Addams family reunion

35:21.452 --> 35:22.453
in lockup tonight.

35:23.162 --> 35:24.914
You're both under arrest.

35:27.917 --> 35:30.545
Get comfortable.
You can post bail in the morning.

35:33.214 --> 35:35.675
Not even the long arm of the law
could keep us apart.

35:35.758 --> 35:37.844
At least we'll have
one last night together.

35:37.927 --> 35:38.761
Yes.

35:38.845 --> 35:41.764
I've seen jackals with more self-control
than you two.

35:43.266 --> 35:46.018
Neither one of you are strong enough
to serve hard time.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.646
And thanks to me, you won't have to.

35:48.729 --> 35:51.649
I knew our little jailbird
would have an escape plan.

35:53.860 --> 35:57.155
It's a souvenir from our outing.
I borrowed it from Garrett.

35:58.239 --> 36:00.283
He died from nightshade poisoning.

36:00.366 --> 36:03.703
The remarkable preservation of soft tissue
and blue tint confirms it.

36:04.745 --> 36:09.250
-Which means Garrett was dying--
-Before you stabbed him.

36:10.710 --> 36:13.713
You look even more ravishing
as an innocent woman.

36:13.796 --> 36:14.630
Yes.

36:14.714 --> 36:17.884
For once, could you two
get off of each other and focus.

36:19.719 --> 36:22.305
Prove to me you're still worthy
to be called my son!

36:22.889 --> 36:24.807
Kill all those outcasts!

36:24.891 --> 36:27.518
Sneak into that dance
and spike the punch bowl.

36:28.519 --> 36:29.812
Addams!

36:34.483 --> 36:35.568
<i>Wednesday.</i>

36:39.947 --> 36:41.490
Did you have a vision?

36:42.742 --> 36:43.868
What happened?

36:44.368 --> 36:45.870
What did you see?

36:47.580 --> 36:48.706
The night Garrett died,

36:48.789 --> 36:52.126
he had a vial of nightshade poison
that broke in his pocket.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.295
He wasn't just trying to kill father.

36:55.671 --> 36:58.925
He was going to use the nightshade poison
to murder the entire school.

37:05.389 --> 37:08.309
Thank you for seeing us
at such short notice, Mr. Mayor.

37:08.392 --> 37:11.020
Yes, well, veiled threats
have that effect.

37:11.604 --> 37:14.106
Garrett Gates wasn't killed
by a stab wound.

37:19.570 --> 37:23.574
That blue sheen is a telltale sign
of nightshade poisoning.

37:23.658 --> 37:26.244
But you already knew that, didn't you?

37:26.327 --> 37:28.246
Because back when you were sheriff,

37:28.329 --> 37:30.206
you were in charge and covered it up.

37:37.672 --> 37:41.634
Ansel Gates hated outcasts and Nevermore.

37:41.717 --> 37:44.679
He claimed the land
the school was built on

37:44.762 --> 37:47.348
was stolen from his family
over 200 years ago.

37:48.182 --> 37:51.352
Garrett went there that night
to spike the punch

37:51.894 --> 37:53.854
and kill all the kids at that dance.

37:54.438 --> 37:58.567
Ansel confessed the whole thing to me
in a drunken stupor. It was his idea.

37:58.651 --> 38:02.029
Why did you instruct Dr. Anwar
to falsify the autopsy report?

38:02.113 --> 38:04.824
You knew the truth
about how he really died.

38:04.907 --> 38:08.202
Listen, my job was to keep the peace.

38:08.286 --> 38:09.495
If there had been a trial,

38:09.578 --> 38:12.415
Jericho's and Nevermore's reputations
would have been trashed.

38:12.498 --> 38:15.960
I think the only reputation you were
worried about ruining was your own.

38:17.044 --> 38:19.255
I remember Garrett bragging to me

38:19.338 --> 38:21.716
that his father
had the sheriff in his pocket.

38:22.800 --> 38:26.178
One year later,
you get elected mayor. Hmm.

38:26.262 --> 38:28.723
No doubt with the full support
of Ansel Gates.

38:28.806 --> 38:31.017
I resent your implication.

38:31.100 --> 38:34.895
What I resent is that
you could have prevented Garrett's death

38:34.979 --> 38:39.608
if you had done your job when I lodged
my complaint about him stalking me.

38:40.109 --> 38:41.110
But no.

38:41.193 --> 38:46.365
Men like you have no idea
what it feels like not to be believed.

38:53.414 --> 38:54.623
What do you want?

38:58.627 --> 39:00.629
All charges dropped.

39:00.713 --> 39:02.340
My father will be released immediately

39:02.423 --> 39:05.509
with a full and unequivocal apology
from the sheriff's office.

39:08.304 --> 39:10.097
Do we have a deal?

39:23.694 --> 39:25.529
You were very impressive in there.

39:31.577 --> 39:33.454
When did your visions begin?

39:36.624 --> 39:37.833
A few months ago.

39:38.334 --> 39:40.336
-Hmm.
-Before I left for Nevermore.

39:41.128 --> 39:43.089
I'm sorry you didn't feel
you could tell me.

39:45.257 --> 39:47.843
I know we've had our difficulties lately.

39:48.386 --> 39:52.306
Navigating the treacherous shoals
of our mother-daughter relationship.

39:55.059 --> 39:57.561
But I'm always here for you, Wednesday.

39:59.105 --> 40:00.189
Always.

40:06.570 --> 40:08.739
Sometimes when I touch
someone or something,

40:09.740 --> 40:12.618
I get these very violent glimpses
from the past or future.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.704
I don't know how to control it.

40:17.415 --> 40:21.001
Our psychic ability resides
on the spectrum of who we are.

40:22.420 --> 40:23.921
Given my disposition,

40:24.004 --> 40:26.424
my visions tend to be positive.

40:26.507 --> 40:27.842
That makes me a Dove.

40:28.676 --> 40:32.471
And for someone like me?
Who sees the world through a darker lens?

40:33.139 --> 40:34.306
You're a Raven.

40:35.516 --> 40:38.352
Your visions are more potent,
more powerful.

40:39.478 --> 40:42.565
But without the proper training,
they can lead to madness.

40:43.691 --> 40:46.110
If I could help you, I would, Wednesday.

40:46.193 --> 40:48.195
But we're not trained by the living.

40:49.113 --> 40:53.909
Somebody from our bloodline reaches out
from beyond to help us when we're ready.

40:55.161 --> 40:56.328
Goody has.

40:57.204 --> 40:58.205
I've seen her before.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.082
Be careful, Wednesday.

41:00.916 --> 41:03.043
Goody was a witch of great strength,

41:03.544 --> 41:05.963
but her vengeance pushed her too far,

41:06.046 --> 41:08.132
and even she couldn't save herself.

41:17.224 --> 41:18.476
Sorry about all this.

41:20.644 --> 41:22.146
I don't hold grudges,

41:22.730 --> 41:23.981
only blood debts.

41:25.941 --> 41:29.153
So, your daughter and my son have become…

41:30.696 --> 41:31.530
close.

41:32.114 --> 41:35.159
I pity any boy
who gets caught in her viper's gaze,

41:35.242 --> 41:36.577
but he must be a good egg.

41:37.578 --> 41:40.164
She wouldn't tolerate anything less.

41:40.915 --> 41:43.209
He has his mom to thank for that.

41:53.385 --> 41:54.303
Dad!

41:55.179 --> 41:57.973
I missed you so much, Dad.
I missed you so much.

42:01.268 --> 42:02.269
<i>Querida.</i>

42:03.646 --> 42:04.688
<i>Mi amor.</i>

42:05.189 --> 42:06.565
Don't crowd me.

42:19.870 --> 42:23.958
So, it's decided. Six weeks at Camp Howl.

42:24.041 --> 42:26.544
-You'll need to pick which activity--
-No, I don't.

42:27.169 --> 42:28.295
Because I'm not going.

42:29.004 --> 42:30.798
Not this summer. Not ever.

42:30.881 --> 42:34.260
If I'm meant to wolf out,
then I'm going to do it on my own timeline

42:34.343 --> 42:35.344
and not yours.

42:37.805 --> 42:40.933
I hope that one day,
you'll finally accept me for who I am.

42:52.194 --> 42:53.696
I'm proud of you, kiddo.

42:55.114 --> 42:56.448
You do you.

43:07.751 --> 43:10.421
I'll come back and help you
under one condition.

43:10.504 --> 43:12.756
Wait until the school year is over.

43:12.840 --> 43:17.136
-How do I know you won't run away again?
-Because we both have too much to lose.

43:17.219 --> 43:18.887
But after this,

43:18.971 --> 43:22.558
you and MorningSong
are out of my life… forever.

43:30.149 --> 43:31.483
Don't push it.

43:34.862 --> 43:38.991
Well, at least we can't say
Parents' Weekend wasn't a nail-biter.

43:39.074 --> 43:41.535
I knew you didn't have what it takes
to be a murderer.

43:42.244 --> 43:44.163
As much as that stings,

43:45.331 --> 43:47.666
<i>gracias</i>, my little death trap.

43:47.750 --> 43:49.126
Mwah.

43:54.715 --> 43:57.635
As I leafed through
the pages of this yearbook,

43:57.718 --> 44:02.681
I was reminded
of all the wonderful times I had here.

44:02.765 --> 44:04.266
But they were just that.

44:05.601 --> 44:06.602
Mine.

44:07.728 --> 44:10.397
You have your own path to blaze.

44:12.107 --> 44:14.485
I don't want to be
a stranger in your life, darling.

44:15.486 --> 44:18.072
If you need me for anything,

44:18.155 --> 44:19.698
anything at all,

44:21.283 --> 44:23.243
I'm only a crystal ball away.

44:24.912 --> 44:26.163
Thank you, Mother.

45:05.786 --> 45:06.620
I knew it.

45:07.871 --> 45:10.124
I did witness Rowan
getting murdered that night.

45:10.207 --> 45:11.166
Excuse me?

45:11.250 --> 45:13.460
When Rowan appeared the next morning,
it was you.

45:14.044 --> 45:16.422
When you participated in the talent show,

45:16.505 --> 45:18.424
not only did you impersonate Judy Garland,

45:18.507 --> 45:19.758
you became her.

45:21.009 --> 45:22.469
You're a shape-shifter.

45:28.392 --> 45:30.561
That's a fascinating theory.

45:31.145 --> 45:34.148
I'm curious to find out
how Sheriff Galpin feels when I tell him.

45:37.359 --> 45:39.778
You won't tell a soul, Miss Addams.

45:39.862 --> 45:41.989
And it wouldn't matter much if you did.

45:42.072 --> 45:44.199
Rowan's father already knows
what happened,

45:44.283 --> 45:47.453
and he fully supports my decision
not to involve the authorities.

45:48.162 --> 45:49.538
Why would he agree to that?

45:49.621 --> 45:52.916
Because Rowan was not in his right mind.

45:53.500 --> 45:55.669
His telekinetic abilities
were driving him mad

45:55.753 --> 45:58.005
and he attempted to murder you twice.

45:58.714 --> 46:03.135
His tragic death allowed us
to rectify the situation

46:03.218 --> 46:06.847
without casting the school
or Rowan in an unflattering light.

46:07.848 --> 46:09.933
You and Mayor Walker are the same,
aren't you?

46:11.101 --> 46:13.520
Burying bodies
to cover your dirty secrets.

46:14.104 --> 46:17.900
I did what I needed to do to shield
this school from controversy

46:17.983 --> 46:19.651
and protect its students from harm.

46:19.735 --> 46:21.195
Tell that to Eugene.

46:23.155 --> 46:25.115
How are you protecting him?

46:37.377 --> 46:38.796
What on earth?
