[grunting]

00:58.784 --> 00:59.953
Where is it? Huh?

00:59.953 --> 01:01.289
Come on. Where is it?

01:01.289 --> 01:03.627
[clamouring]

01:03.627 --> 01:06.341
[parent] Shit. [laughing]

01:06.341 --> 01:07.594
You're so cute.

01:07.594 --> 01:10.057
[business person]
Oh, no. Silver is the new Bitcoin.

01:10.057 --> 01:12.269
I'm telling you. It's going to the moon.

01:12.269 --> 01:13.355
I'll see you in Monaco.

01:13.355 --> 01:15.652
[clamouring, laughing]

01:15.652 --> 01:16.945
Oh, my God!

[crying]

01:35.190 --> 01:37.361
[gasps] Why? [cries]

01:45.586 --> 01:48.216
[person outside stall sighs]
You're such a knob. Such a knob.

01:50.095 --> 01:51.890
Uh, you're being pathetic.

01:51.890 --> 01:53.602
Get a grip. Get a grip.

01:54.604 --> 01:56.357
[stall door closes]

01:56.357 --> 01:57.527
[person urinating]

01:57.527 --> 01:58.696
- Hello?
- [gasps]

01:59.531 --> 02:00.700
[urination stops]

02:02.494 --> 02:03.622
Hello.

02:06.252 --> 02:07.714
This is the gents.

02:08.632 --> 02:11.805
No. Actually, it's unisex.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.272
[urination resumes]

02:18.026 --> 02:20.447
[crying, sniffling]

[toilet flushes]

02:34.308 --> 02:36.312
[crying continues]

02:38.526 --> 02:40.320
[person] Everything all right in there?

02:41.239 --> 02:42.241
Yep.

02:43.493 --> 02:45.915
- Fine. [gasps]
- All right. Cool.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.002
Cool.

02:48.002 --> 02:50.048
[sobbing]

02:50.048 --> 02:52.386
Uh, just to let you know,
I haven't quite left yet.

02:52.386 --> 02:54.181
I can't figure out how the...

02:57.354 --> 02:58.732
- [water flowing]
- Oh. [chuckles]

02:58.732 --> 03:00.318
It was-- It was the wrong tap.

03:00.903 --> 03:03.283
Excuse me.
I'm trying to have a private moment.

03:03.283 --> 03:04.953
- [water stops]
- [person] My bad.

03:05.705 --> 03:07.165
It's not that private though.

03:09.629 --> 03:10.631
[patron laughing]

03:11.800 --> 03:13.554
[muttering] Mouth. Oh.

03:17.144 --> 03:19.148
- [patrons chattering]
- [gasps] Huh?

03:19.148 --> 03:22.404
[vocalising]

03:22.404 --> 03:23.657
[patron coughing]

03:27.080 --> 03:29.544
- No photos! [laughing]
- Oh, my God!

03:29.544 --> 03:30.630
You're so annoying.

03:33.259 --> 03:35.305
- How are you feeling for later?
- Good, yeah.

03:35.305 --> 03:36.474
- You nervous?
- Not nervous.

03:36.474 --> 03:38.311
- Don't be nervous.
- I'm not nervous.

03:43.488 --> 03:45.951
- Anyway, where's Picasso?
- [chuckles]

03:45.951 --> 03:47.037
Aight, boom.

03:47.037 --> 03:49.458
[friend]
<i>Probably being his low-key, humble self.</i>

03:49.458 --> 03:52.339
Babes, we know more about
the planet Jupiter

03:52.339 --> 03:54.259
than we do the inside of our own mouths.

03:54.761 --> 03:55.846
That's facts.

03:55.846 --> 03:59.813
Real talk,
the mouth is the Stonehenge of the face.

03:59.813 --> 04:01.190
Mind fuck, right?

04:01.190 --> 04:02.527
All right. Well, thanks for coming.

04:02.527 --> 04:04.029
- My brother.
- [sighs] Hey.

04:04.739 --> 04:07.119
- Appreciate you coming, bro.
- Course, man.

04:07.119 --> 04:09.206
Hey, love the photos. They're just so--

04:09.206 --> 04:11.085
- Safe.
- How's sales?

04:11.085 --> 04:13.549
Yeah, couple potential nibbles.

04:14.133 --> 04:15.427
See the hoverboard-riding geezer?

04:15.427 --> 04:18.684
This close to payin' a G for a shot
of my cousin Calvin's molars.

04:18.684 --> 04:19.769
[both chuckle]

04:19.769 --> 04:22.650
[artist] What's good, Wes Anderson?
You cool, yeah?

04:23.902 --> 04:25.573
It's good to see you
out and about again, Dom.

04:25.573 --> 04:27.702
- Good to be out and about.
- Everything's...

04:27.702 --> 04:28.996
Oh, everything's wicked.

04:28.996 --> 04:31.333
Yeah, I started Pilates.

04:31.333 --> 04:32.545
- Is it?
- Yeah.

04:32.545 --> 04:34.841
Uh, workin' on my core, workin' on me.
You know, getting positive.

04:34.841 --> 04:36.928
Aight. Do you, innit.

04:36.928 --> 04:39.057
[chuckles] Cheers, man. Cheers.

04:39.057 --> 04:40.143
Hey, so listen--

04:40.143 --> 04:41.688
Shh.

04:41.688 --> 04:44.026
You know what? I was about to dip.

04:44.903 --> 04:47.950
Go mingle with some
of these sockless wonders.

04:47.950 --> 04:49.119
- Uh...
- What?

04:49.119 --> 04:51.583
You weren't about to bring up
Eric and Gia, no?

04:52.794 --> 04:54.631
- Have you seen her latest post?
- No.

04:54.631 --> 04:57.177
She's repainting walls
I already broke my back painting.

04:57.177 --> 04:59.599
- Tryin' to erase I was ever there.
- It's just paint, my guy.

04:59.599 --> 05:01.645
If it makes you feel any better,
from what I saw,

05:01.645 --> 05:03.356
they were only doing the living room.

05:03.356 --> 05:04.818
Thought you hadn't seen the photo.

05:06.195 --> 05:08.449
Aight, look, don't prang out.

05:08.449 --> 05:10.788
They had this paint-party-brunch ting.

05:10.788 --> 05:11.790
[laughing]

05:12.415 --> 05:14.629
But I only stayed for 45 minutes,
painted a tiny bit of a door,

05:14.629 --> 05:16.257
ate half an almond croissant and bounced.

05:16.257 --> 05:19.137
[laughing, chattering]

05:19.137 --> 05:20.641
You went to brunch at our flat?

05:20.641 --> 05:23.939
- [sighs]
- Seriously, is nothing sacred anymore?

05:24.649 --> 05:26.485
- Fuck!
- [gasps]

05:26.485 --> 05:28.782
[artist] You cool?
'Cause if you're gonna freak out,

05:28.782 --> 05:30.786
I'ma sling a sign on you,
call it performance art.

05:32.205 --> 05:33.207
You cool?

05:34.001 --> 05:35.003
- Yeah.
- You're cool?

05:35.546 --> 05:36.548
I'm cool.

05:36.548 --> 05:39.094
Cool. Aight.

05:39.094 --> 05:40.471
- Come here.
- [artist] Oh, shit.

05:40.471 --> 05:42.643
Let me see what's up
with my girl real quick.

05:43.477 --> 05:46.233
Be cool. Be cool.

05:53.205 --> 05:55.794
[hoverboarder]
This would look amazing in the boot room.

06:13.371 --> 06:14.373
How you doin'?

06:16.085 --> 06:17.045
Yeah, good.

06:17.045 --> 06:18.297
Yeah?

06:19.884 --> 06:21.220
Yeah.

06:21.220 --> 06:22.305
Cool.

06:24.686 --> 06:25.854
So, whatcha think?

06:27.273 --> 06:29.319
- [Dom] The photos?
- Mmm.

06:29.319 --> 06:30.446
Yeah. Yeah. Amazing.

06:30.446 --> 06:33.704
They have a real, like, cerebral feel.

06:34.288 --> 06:35.415
Cerebral?

06:36.208 --> 06:39.674
Yeah.
Or maybe lyrical is a better way to--

06:40.676 --> 06:42.012
Or expressive.

06:42.012 --> 06:43.974
Wow. You know all the adjectives.

06:45.476 --> 06:48.441
Now, this one, I fucking adore.

06:48.441 --> 06:51.113
[Dom] Yeah, I love the way
the tongue follows you around the room.

06:52.533 --> 06:56.081
- So, do you know Nath or--
- Oh, I'm mates with his girlfriend.

06:56.081 --> 06:57.626
Oh, cool. That's cool.

06:57.626 --> 07:00.423
I know Cass. She's cool.

07:01.300 --> 07:03.304
She is cool.

07:03.304 --> 07:04.389
[chuckles]

07:05.099 --> 07:08.272
We met at work. Me and Nath.

07:08.272 --> 07:11.696
- Oh, you're an artist?
- Oh, no. KFC. [chuckles]

07:11.696 --> 07:13.742
Back in the day.
I don't work there anymore.

07:14.242 --> 07:15.244
[chuckles]

07:15.788 --> 07:17.207
'Sup, my little fuck nuggets? [chuckles]

07:17.207 --> 07:19.127
- [chuckles]
- Basking in your genius, dude.

07:19.127 --> 07:20.923
[Nathan] Oh, please. Continue.

07:20.923 --> 07:22.718
This one's pretty special, innit?

07:23.845 --> 07:25.849
Yeah, man.
We were just saying exactly that.

07:25.849 --> 07:27.645
- Yeah?
- Yeah. [chuckles]

07:27.645 --> 07:29.147
Why don't you treat yourself?

07:30.358 --> 07:31.360
[clicks tongue]

07:31.861 --> 07:33.740
Oh, no, bro, I just came to support you.
I wasn't gonna--

07:33.740 --> 07:36.538
Oh, come on. Help a brother out.

07:36.538 --> 07:39.627
People see you coppin',
might inspire them.

07:39.627 --> 07:40.712
[sighs]

07:41.380 --> 07:42.967
Look,
I know you ain't payin' bills right now.

07:42.967 --> 07:44.762
Man must have bare peas saved up.

07:47.183 --> 07:49.146
I think it's very you.

07:49.146 --> 07:51.316
Uh... [grunts]

07:59.750 --> 08:01.796
Sorry,
I kinda feel like that was my fault.

08:01.796 --> 08:04.301
No, no, no, no. Nath kinda seemed like
he needed the boost.

08:04.301 --> 08:05.386
Plus, it's an investment.

08:05.386 --> 08:07.265
When he blows up,
I'll sell it on for a fortune.

08:07.265 --> 08:08.475
[Yas chuckles]

08:11.064 --> 08:12.275
- Well, anyway--
- You going this way?

08:12.275 --> 08:13.528
Yeah, I was gonna-- Yeah.

08:13.528 --> 08:14.614
Me too.

08:18.495 --> 08:20.374
[vendor] Hey, guys!
I've got chillies here, guys.

08:20.374 --> 08:22.630
Chillies red,
chillies gold, chillies green.

08:22.630 --> 08:25.259
And I call them the traffic lights
of the chilli scene.

08:25.259 --> 08:26.386
Hey, Uncle.

08:26.386 --> 08:29.518
[vendor] Ah! Here she is.
My hot cup of cocoa on a frosty mornin'.

08:29.518 --> 08:31.230
[laughs] I'll see you soon, okay?

08:31.230 --> 08:33.108
- I'll be counting the seconds.
- [chuckling]

08:33.108 --> 08:34.194
I've got chillies fresh...

08:34.946 --> 08:36.156
It's Dom, right?

08:36.783 --> 08:38.077
I'm Yas.

08:38.077 --> 08:39.204
Nice to meet you.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.462
[both chuckle]

08:44.214 --> 08:45.634
Eh? Okay.

08:45.634 --> 08:46.803
So, where you off to?

08:47.303 --> 08:49.349
What errands has your mum got you
out here runnin'?

08:52.063 --> 08:55.194
Oh, Nathan mentioned you don't pay bills,
so I figured you still live at home?

08:55.194 --> 08:57.198
I'm back. Back at home.

08:57.700 --> 09:00.706
"Back" is important, otherwise
it sounds like I never left, and I did.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.250
Okay. Fair.

09:04.296 --> 09:06.509
I'm actually cutting through.

09:06.509 --> 09:07.720
Rye Lane Market?

09:07.720 --> 09:09.472
- Yeah. Yeah.
- [chuckles]

09:09.974 --> 09:12.186
Lucky for you, I'm going this way anyway.

09:14.859 --> 09:18.115
So, what do you do now you've escaped
the clutches of the Colonel?

09:19.535 --> 09:21.204
Like, with your post-KFC life.

09:21.204 --> 09:22.916
Oh, I'm an accountant.

09:22.916 --> 09:24.336
[sing-songy] Boring.

09:24.336 --> 09:26.633
[Yas] Okay.

09:26.633 --> 09:29.889
No free popcorn chicken,
but still, that's like a proper job.

09:29.889 --> 09:32.310
[chuckles] Yeah,
it's not particularly glamorous.

09:32.310 --> 09:34.064
- [Yas] No.
- But I actually kinda love it.

09:34.064 --> 09:35.859
So, is that
what you've always wanted to do,

09:35.859 --> 09:38.948
or have you got yourself some thwarted
ambition burning away in ya gut?

09:40.284 --> 09:41.495
- You know, you're very--
- Peng?

09:41.495 --> 09:42.831
Refreshingly disarming?

09:42.831 --> 09:45.127
- You ask a lot of questions.
- I'm interested in people's messes.

09:45.127 --> 09:48.300
- What makes you think I've got a mess?
- Everyone has a mess.

09:48.300 --> 09:49.386
Hi.

09:51.181 --> 09:52.183
[chuckles]

09:52.768 --> 09:54.689
Okay. Um...

09:54.689 --> 09:56.149
[chuckles]

09:56.149 --> 09:59.824
You know, I-- I think
I did always wanna be an accountant.

09:59.824 --> 10:01.243
Is that-- Is that weird?

10:01.243 --> 10:03.540
Don't ask me.
I wanted to be Prince when I was little.

10:03.540 --> 10:05.000
Specifically, <i>Purple Rain</i> Prince.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.044
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:06.044 --> 10:08.257
I made myself a little costume
and everything.

10:08.257 --> 10:10.929
[guitar riff plays]

10:12.891 --> 10:14.352
[laughs]

10:14.352 --> 10:15.438
[Yas chuckles]

10:20.699 --> 10:23.495
So, are you the only wannabe accountant
in your crew?

10:23.495 --> 10:26.544
[Dom] All my mates thought they were gonna
be footballers or YouTube sensations,

10:26.544 --> 10:29.257
chilling on private jets,
living extraordinary lives...

10:29.257 --> 10:31.094
[Yas] Oh, private jets not your ting, no?

10:31.094 --> 10:34.184
[Dom] Do you know how much
they cost to run? Terrible investment.

10:34.184 --> 10:35.937
- [Yas chuckles]
- So, what about you?

10:35.937 --> 10:37.231
What do you do anyway?

10:37.733 --> 10:39.945
Me? Well, I'm a YouTube sensation.

10:39.945 --> 10:42.033
[children screaming, chattering]

10:42.743 --> 10:43.828
Nah, I work in fashion.

10:43.828 --> 10:46.458
[chuckles] Hence the Prince costume.

10:46.458 --> 10:48.086
- Exactly!
- [chuckles]

10:48.086 --> 10:49.757
So you're like a designer or--

10:49.757 --> 10:51.301
Oh, you saying I couldn't be a model?

10:51.301 --> 10:54.224
- No. I just-- assumed 'cause you--
- Uh-- Uh--

10:54.224 --> 10:56.102
- I'm fuckin' with you. [chuckles]
- Oh.

10:56.102 --> 10:58.817
I am a buyer for an online brand
that you wouldn't have heard of.

10:58.817 --> 11:02.198
But I wanna design costumes.
That's, like, the end game.

11:02.699 --> 11:03.910
- [Dom] Costumes?
- Yeah.

11:03.910 --> 11:10.549
TV, films, music videos, ball gowns
to alien queens to anything the fuck else.

11:10.549 --> 11:13.178
But do you know how much
these thieves wanna pay me

11:13.178 --> 11:15.224
to be a bottom-level costume assistant?

11:15.224 --> 11:16.393
I'm guessing not a lot.

11:16.393 --> 11:18.606
Not a lot divided by fuck all. [chuckles]

11:18.606 --> 11:20.902
Plus with your ting, the square root
of ten is always, like, what--

11:20.902 --> 11:22.906
3.16-ish.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.579
Okay. I'll take your word for it.

11:26.956 --> 11:31.381
But I can't just wake up
and decide to be a costume designer.

11:31.381 --> 11:32.926
I've gotta pay my dues.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.974
And paying my dues means
not paying my rent

11:35.974 --> 11:38.605
or being able to afford cute cocktails.

11:38.605 --> 11:42.445
And I like paying my rent,
and I love cute cocktails, so...

11:42.445 --> 11:44.365
[chuckles] Yeah, I know. I get that.

11:45.367 --> 11:47.706
But I'll get there

11:48.833 --> 11:50.712
eventually. [chuckles]

11:51.881 --> 11:53.216

11:57.809 --> 11:59.187
- No. I'm okay.
- Okay.

11:59.187 --> 12:01.024
- [chuckles] Oh!
- [laughing]

12:09.708 --> 12:14.384
Each step bringing them closer
to their mystery destination.

12:14.384 --> 12:17.014
Okay. But no judgments, yeah?

12:17.014 --> 12:18.601
Mmm, sounds juicy.

12:18.601 --> 12:20.981
- I'm not running errands.
- Yeah, we're past that, babe.

12:20.981 --> 12:23.945
I'm gonna meet my ex
for the first time since the break-up.

12:24.445 --> 12:29.790
Shit. And you're still calling it
"the" break-up, meaning it's fresh?

12:29.790 --> 12:32.336
Three months.
But we were goin' out for six years.

12:32.336 --> 12:33.840
Six years?

12:33.840 --> 12:36.679
You could've become
a fully qualified architect in that time.

12:36.679 --> 12:37.931
Yeah. It was pretty bad.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.643
It is pretty bad.

12:41.564 --> 12:43.776
I went through the same sort of thing
not too long ago.

12:43.776 --> 12:44.695
Yeah?

12:44.695 --> 12:46.448
We were only together
for a year and a bit though--

12:46.448 --> 12:49.621
Did you wake up every day and lie there
trying to muster the energy to breathe?

12:49.621 --> 12:51.542
No. 'Cause I finished with him,

12:51.542 --> 12:54.757
so I just felt kind of relieved
and empowered afterwards, you know?

12:55.759 --> 12:57.470
[stammers]
He was tryin' to dilute my squash,

12:57.470 --> 12:59.600
and I was like,
"Not today, Satan." [chuckles]

12:59.600 --> 13:00.685
I'm sorry. Sorry.

13:00.685 --> 13:02.480
No, no, no, no. I'm happy for you.

13:02.480 --> 13:05.360
Must be nice being on that side of it,
not that I'll ever know.

13:05.360 --> 13:09.578
Hey, hey, I believe in your ability to
completely destroy someone's life one day.

13:09.578 --> 13:10.789
- Thanks.
- Mmm.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.462
Aight, so, she broke up with you.
I know that much already.

13:14.462 --> 13:16.801
Actually, it's still pretty hard
to talk about the details, so...

13:16.801 --> 13:18.094
Oh, okay, sorry. We don't actually--

13:18.094 --> 13:19.848
The bit that really hurts,
I thought we were fine.

13:19.848 --> 13:21.476
We were better than fine.
We moved in together.

13:21.476 --> 13:22.896
We had Hamilton tickets. Stalls!

13:22.896 --> 13:24.482
It's a serious commitment.

13:24.482 --> 13:25.860
Right?

13:25.860 --> 13:28.073
So go on. Spill the tea! What happened?

13:28.073 --> 13:29.743
So we were goin' to the cinema.

13:30.285 --> 13:31.287
[Yas] Oh?

13:33.083 --> 13:36.005
I get there first, as usual,
and I go buy the snacks.

13:36.005 --> 13:37.091
Mmm, stuntin' on 'em.

13:37.091 --> 13:39.470
You don't even understand
how picky this girl is.

13:39.470 --> 13:43.521
Hello. Hey. Um, can I get a number three
with a medium sweet and salt popcorn

13:43.521 --> 13:45.608
and, um, a diet cola please?

13:45.608 --> 13:48.948
Um, uh, but can the sweet be on bottom?
So it's like pudding.

13:48.948 --> 13:50.367
I'm already ragin'.

13:50.952 --> 13:53.123
Oh, sorry.
Uh, not too much ice in the drink.

13:53.123 --> 13:55.294
Like an inch. Specifically, uh, an inch.

13:56.505 --> 13:58.968
And you gotta understand,
I take cinema etiquette seriously.

13:58.968 --> 14:00.763
Like, I won't go in
once the film's started.

14:00.763 --> 14:02.182
You gotta respect the code.

14:02.182 --> 14:04.270

your profile pics do not do you justice.

20:52.670 --> 20:53.964
[chuckles] I'm Yas.

20:55.759 --> 20:57.470
Hi. I'm Eric.

20:57.470 --> 20:59.057
Ah. He of the low-res cock.

20:59.057 --> 21:01.228
- [spits]
- [laughs] My rep precedes me.

21:01.228 --> 21:02.439
[chuckles] Geez!

21:02.439 --> 21:03.942
Thank you. Smells amazing.

21:03.942 --> 21:05.654
[Gia] Sorry, I'm a little bit lost.

21:06.573 --> 21:08.618
- You are...
- Yas. Dom's...

21:09.579 --> 21:12.626
Well, we're not really labelling it yet,
are we?

21:12.626 --> 21:15.173
But I guess we're just kind of
low-key fucking at the moment.

21:15.173 --> 21:16.885
Uh, we're vibin', so, you know...

21:16.885 --> 21:18.597
- Okay.
- [Yas] Who knows?

21:18.597 --> 21:20.976
Okay, I see you, movin' up in the world.

21:20.976 --> 21:23.147
- [Gia grunts]
- [laughs]

21:23.147 --> 21:24.232
Not up.

21:24.232 --> 21:26.236
Um, I thought we agreed--

21:26.236 --> 21:29.451
I know what I said,
but I missed you, my sexy dumpling.

21:30.036 --> 21:31.371
You guys don't mind, right?

21:31.371 --> 21:32.917
- [clears throat] No.
- Mm-mmm.

21:32.917 --> 21:35.087
No, I-- I love that you're here.

21:35.087 --> 21:38.385
Um, we actually ordered some bits
for the table, so help yourself.

21:38.385 --> 21:41.433
And try one of those croquette tings,
it'll make you cream.

21:41.935 --> 21:43.187
Geez!

21:44.189 --> 21:47.988
[clicks tongue] Anyway,
I wanna know everything.

21:48.489 --> 21:50.619
Um, how-- how did you guys meet?

21:50.619 --> 21:53.583
Oh, it's a pretty cute story.
Do you wanna tell it, bub?

21:53.583 --> 21:55.169
No, you, uh, go for it,

21:55.921 --> 21:56.923

21:57.550 --> 21:59.512
You guys heard of Nothin' But A G Thang?

21:59.512 --> 22:01.891
It's this fire hip-hop karaoke night.

22:01.891 --> 22:03.895
Me and my girls were there
a few nights back.

22:03.895 --> 22:07.778
And, you know, I was just chillin',
fighting off an onslaught of dead guys.

22:07.778 --> 22:08.947
And just as I'm thinkin',

22:08.947 --> 22:13.957
"Rah, there isn't a single decent guy
in this entire place," I hear...

22:13.957 --> 22:16.420
- We have Yas! Come on!
- [applause]

22:16.420 --> 22:19.217
Turns out one of my girls put
my name down as a joke! [laughs]

22:19.217 --> 22:22.600
[emcee] How about
we have ourselves a little duet?

22:25.479 --> 22:32.327
And it was just this immediate,
deep, animal attraction.

22:32.327 --> 22:35.124
Palpable sexual energy crackling.
Everyone in the room could feel it.

22:35.124 --> 22:36.210
- [laughs]
- Really?

22:36.210 --> 22:38.130
- Yeah.
- Yeah, really.

22:38.130 --> 22:40.928
But, you know, calling it "a room"
makes it sound kinda small.

22:40.928 --> 22:44.434
[crowd cheering]

22:44.434 --> 22:48.442
- [Dom] <i>We lit that place up.</i>
- [fan] We love you, Dom and Yas!

- [Dom] <i>People were losin' their minds.</i>
- [fan] I want your babies!

22:51.783 --> 22:55.039
And there was just, like,
this sea of people.

22:55.039 --> 22:56.834
- Like a mini concert.
- Mmm.

22:56.834 --> 22:59.130
[Dom] <i>And when we finished,
the crowd started chanting...</i>

22:59.130 --> 23:01.678
[both] Dom and Yas. Dom and Yas.

23:01.678 --> 23:04.099
- Yas and Dom. Yam and Yas.
- Dom-Dom. Dom and Yas.

23:04.099 --> 23:07.773
Dom and Yas! Yas and Dom!
Dom and Yas! Yas and Dom!

23:07.773 --> 23:09.777

23:17.918 --> 23:19.129
[Yas laughing]

23:19.129 --> 23:21.133
They were gonna tear the place down
if we didn't go again,

23:21.133 --> 23:22.970
- so we did, like, five, six...
- It was 20.

23:22.970 --> 23:24.849
- ...more songs. It was wild.
- Mm-hmm.

23:24.849 --> 23:25.934
[chuckles]

23:25.934 --> 23:29.274
Well, that's gotta be, hands down,
the greatest hook-up story of all time.

23:31.779 --> 23:34.075
You did karaoke?

23:34.577 --> 23:35.746
I guess you were right.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.543
People do change.

23:39.335 --> 23:40.589
- [waiters] Lamb?
- Yeah--

23:40.589 --> 23:42.133
- No!
- [pounds on table]

23:42.133 --> 23:43.427
- Thank you!
- [Yas snickers]

23:46.266 --> 23:48.187
[Eric] Oh, shit. D, guess what?

23:48.187 --> 23:50.191
I got fired from the sports bar.

23:50.191 --> 23:51.694
- [Gia chuckles]
- [Dom] No.

23:51.694 --> 23:52.946
- Baby...
- Yeah.

23:52.946 --> 23:54.282
...why you bringing that up now?

23:54.282 --> 23:56.078
He used to work there. It's banter.

23:56.078 --> 23:58.123
- Yeah.
- [Eric] Yeah. You know how it was, like,

23:58.123 --> 24:00.879
if you have to go to the staff loos
by going down to the basement?

24:00.879 --> 24:02.048
Got tired of doing that.

24:02.048 --> 24:03.718
So, I just started pissing
in Oasis bottles,

24:03.718 --> 24:06.473
'cause you know that big rim, no spillage.

24:06.974 --> 24:09.229
I stuck 'em all in my locker,
and I kept on sayin', like,

24:09.229 --> 24:10.857
"Just empty it. Empty it."

24:10.857 --> 24:13.905
And manager caught me with, like,
18 bottles of piss in there.

24:13.905 --> 24:15.575
I tried to say it was apple juice.

24:15.575 --> 24:17.495
But he was like,
"Nah, that's piss. I can smell it."

24:17.495 --> 24:19.040
"Uh, yeah, it's piss."

24:19.917 --> 24:21.419
I can't believe they fired you for that.

24:21.419 --> 24:23.550
I know. They're, like--
They're super political there.

24:23.550 --> 24:24.635
- [Yas] Mmm.
- They're-- Yeah.

24:24.635 --> 24:26.597
[laughs] Sorry, sorry.

24:26.597 --> 24:27.975
I'm struggling with something here.

24:27.975 --> 24:30.312
You cheated on Dom with him?

24:31.189 --> 24:32.776
- Excuse you?
- Yas--

24:32.776 --> 24:34.572
No, I need to figure this out
because it's baffling.

24:34.572 --> 24:38.538
You dumped this funny, clever,
successful accountant

24:38.538 --> 24:40.834
for this jobless human bin-fire?

24:40.834 --> 24:42.211
Oh, that hurts a little bit.

24:42.211 --> 24:45.217
I mean, I get it, the arms are nice,
but what do you even talk about?

24:45.217 --> 24:47.514
Are you gonna sit there
and let her say that shit to me?

24:47.514 --> 24:48.683
Well, she said my arms are nice.

24:48.683 --> 24:50.269
In hindsight, this was a terrible idea.

24:50.269 --> 24:51.772
I was trying to give everyone some harmony

24:51.772 --> 24:53.735
and allow everyone to live
in their truths, but whatever.

24:53.735 --> 24:55.237
[Yas] But you are living your truth.

24:55.237 --> 24:57.158
You cheated on him
with his best mate from primary school.

24:57.158 --> 25:01.542
St John's, Dunloe. Buckeye!
Buckeye-kye! La-la-la-la la...

25:01.542 --> 25:03.462
[Yas] You tricked him into believing
he'd found a person

25:03.462 --> 25:05.341
that wanted to get to know him,
like, properly,

25:05.341 --> 25:07.053
and instead of realising
what a gift that was,

25:07.053 --> 25:09.516
someone baring their actual soul to you,
you got scared.

25:09.516 --> 25:10.602
And so you clicked reset

25:10.602 --> 25:13.315
and moved on with the closest
and least complicated option.

25:13.315 --> 25:14.442
That is your truth.

25:18.367 --> 25:21.999
And, by the way, your man swiped me
on Tinder, like, a week ago.

25:21.999 --> 25:23.878
- What?
- Mmm. No, I didn't.

25:23.878 --> 25:25.507
- I didn't swipe you.
- [Gia] Give me your phone.

25:25.507 --> 25:26.801
- Or anybody.
- Now.

25:26.801 --> 25:28.136
- I didn't swipe her.
- [Gia] Eric.

25:28.136 --> 25:29.389
- Phone.
- [Eric] It's on rest mode.

25:29.389 --> 25:31.519
- It's on sleepy mode. It's off.
- [Gia] Now.

25:31.519 --> 25:32.688
[Eric] Airplane mode?

25:33.564 --> 25:35.150
I can't believe you just did that!

25:35.150 --> 25:38.198
Did you see Gia's face when we were
tag-teaming the karaoke story?

25:38.198 --> 25:39.952
She was shook!

25:39.952 --> 25:41.914
[chuckles] I feel good.

25:41.914 --> 25:43.250
Man, where did that come from,

25:43.250 --> 25:45.379
all that stuff
about it getting too real for her?

25:45.379 --> 25:47.216
Uh, don't know.
I guess just everything you told me.

25:47.216 --> 25:48.302
Well, you nailed it.

25:48.302 --> 25:49.805
It's exactly
what I've been wanting to say,

25:49.805 --> 25:52.018
but I've been too busy rolling over
like a bitch.

25:52.018 --> 25:53.771

- No, it's true though.

- Come on--

26:02.038 --> 26:05.169
No, listen, you just rode to my rescue.
It's the least I can do.

[Yas] My favourite subject.

30:16.588 --> 30:19.594
[Dom chuckles] Were you two living
together then before you... [clicks tongue]

30:19.594 --> 30:21.430
Uh, no. We weren't quite there yet.

30:21.932 --> 30:23.017
Makes it easier, I guess.

30:23.017 --> 30:25.188
Not having to chainsaw
the flat-screen in half.

30:25.188 --> 30:26.775
[clears throat] There's that.

30:26.775 --> 30:29.781
Plus, I doubt there'd be a lot of,
uh, bike rides

30:29.781 --> 30:31.618
and boiled eggs if I rocked up home.

30:31.618 --> 30:32.704
[Dom chuckles]

30:33.664 --> 30:34.666
[Yas grunts]

30:40.010 --> 30:41.137
[instructor] Four...

30:41.137 --> 30:43.349
- [Yas] That will be me one day, man.
- Five...

30:43.349 --> 30:46.982
[Yas] Couple rich ex-husbands,
menstruation a distant memory,

30:46.982 --> 30:49.028
sat out in the park with both my legs
behind my head.

30:49.028 --> 30:50.447
It's just beautiful.

30:51.282 --> 30:52.284
[instructor] Three.

30:52.284 --> 30:53.494
[groans]

30:54.121 --> 30:55.833
- Four.
- [groaning]

30:57.127 --> 30:58.923
- [Dom] That will be me.
- Five.

30:58.923 --> 31:01.637
Old but still thirsty.

31:01.637 --> 31:03.097
[chuckles]

31:03.097 --> 31:04.183
[instructor] Six...

31:04.183 --> 31:05.268
[chuckles]

31:06.312 --> 31:08.066
- [sighs]
- [instructor] Change your legs.

31:08.066 --> 31:12.199
So, before the Eric stuff,
you had no idea you and Gia were done?

31:14.078 --> 31:16.625
Nope. Thought we were all set. [chuckles]

31:17.459 --> 31:18.671
[Yas] Really?

31:18.671 --> 31:20.423
There wasn't a single moment?

31:21.425 --> 31:24.348
A tiny crack in the beautiful pottery
that was you and her?

31:27.145 --> 31:28.899
I'm gonna need to think about that.

31:30.778 --> 31:32.114
You go first.

31:32.114 --> 31:34.368
When did you realise you
and your ex were done?

31:34.368 --> 31:38.585
Oh. There were probably a shitload
of alarm bells I was snoozing through.

31:38.585 --> 31:41.675
But if I had to pick a specific moment...

31:46.183 --> 31:47.352
He don't wave at boats.

31:47.854 --> 31:48.856
Say again?

31:48.856 --> 31:50.025
[passengers cheering]

31:50.025 --> 31:52.947
[Yas] <i>If people on a boat wave at you,
you have to wave back.</i>

31:52.947 --> 31:54.033
<i>It's the law.</i>

31:54.033 --> 31:56.538
Tourism funds sex trafficking.

31:57.540 --> 31:58.542
Hmm.

31:59.627 --> 32:02.550
[ship horn blows]

32:02.550 --> 32:04.763
[chuckles] What?

32:04.763 --> 32:07.852
So apparently there are two types
of people in this world.

32:08.436 --> 32:10.231
The ones who wave at boats

32:10.816 --> 32:12.152
and the ones who hate joy.

32:12.152 --> 32:13.572
Which one am I?

32:17.580 --> 32:18.582
Haven't decided yet.

32:24.093 --> 32:28.101
Oh, so, I have thought about
my writing-on-the-wall moment.

32:28.644 --> 32:30.898
This still wakes me up at night cringin'.

32:30.898 --> 32:32.234
[Yas] Ooh, this gonna be good.

32:32.234 --> 32:33.319
[Dom sighs]

32:34.572 --> 32:41.377
Okay, um, so, a while back,
for our anniversary,

32:41.377 --> 32:43.131
I wanted to do something special.

32:44.466 --> 32:47.932
<i>So I booked the place we ended up at
on our first date.</i>

32:49.101 --> 32:50.938
Can't believe
I filled in my eyebrows for this.

32:51.438 --> 32:53.151
- [Dom] <i>Late-night Morley's.</i>
- [vehicle passes]

32:53.151 --> 32:55.405
<i>I thought it would be cute and romantic.</i>

32:55.405 --> 32:57.367
<i>A sweet little throwback...</i>

32:58.035 --> 32:59.204
[knocking]

32:59.204 --> 33:01.543
Hey-yo, boss man! I need chicken!

33:02.043 --> 33:03.462
[Dom] <i>...but apparently not.</i>

33:03.964 --> 33:05.843
Hey, you're a lucky girl, aren't you?

33:05.843 --> 33:07.930
[smoke alarm beeping]

33:08.765 --> 33:11.145
Anyway,
that was the last grand gesture I tried.

33:12.523 --> 33:13.984
Okay, I'm not even lyin', yeah?

33:13.984 --> 33:16.071
That is literally my dream date.

33:16.071 --> 33:21.958
In fact, if I had a restaurant,
I'd call it "Nuggets by Candlelight".

33:21.958 --> 33:23.461
- [chuckles]
- [laughs]

33:23.461 --> 33:24.923
- No, but I'm not even joking.
- Loser.

33:24.923 --> 33:26.383
How could she not find that cute?

33:26.383 --> 33:27.553
I don't know.

33:27.553 --> 33:31.143
But that is my side of the story, innit?

33:31.143 --> 33:33.982
I bet Gia must have loads of
writin'-on-the-wall stories about me.

33:33.982 --> 33:36.237
And there you go again,
trying to share the blame.

33:36.237 --> 33:39.284
Well, I'm just saying,
what if they actually are meant to be?

33:39.786 --> 33:42.123
- Gia and Eric?
- Yeah.

33:42.123 --> 33:44.712
What if I'm the awkward hook-up story?

33:45.296 --> 33:48.762
A funny anecdote
in a future best man's speech?

33:49.973 --> 33:52.561
Wow. That is insanely forgiving.

33:53.855 --> 33:56.528
[clicks tongue] I know.
Maybe you've just inspired me.

33:57.530 --> 33:59.241
How chill you are about your ex.

33:59.742 --> 34:01.453
Maybe it's time I tried that shit.

34:02.038 --> 34:06.881
[chuckles] Hey. Not everyone can be this,
uh, progressive. Takes talent.

34:06.881 --> 34:08.885
[Yas laughs]

34:09.595 --> 34:12.183
So, you were a grand gesture guy, then?

34:12.183 --> 34:13.269
[Dom] Big time.

34:13.269 --> 34:15.231
I once hid chocolates
in my girlfriend's bed,

34:15.231 --> 34:17.444
but they melted,
and she thought I shit myself.

34:17.444 --> 34:19.615
[Yas laughs]

34:20.116 --> 34:22.913
[Dom laughing]

34:22.913 --> 34:24.625
- I won't be doing that again.
- [Yas] Uh-huh.

34:29.719 --> 34:30.721
[dog barking]

34:34.478 --> 34:35.731
We should go get a drink.

34:37.150 --> 34:38.152
Definitely.

34:39.321 --> 34:41.200
I'll make you miss your last train today.

34:41.200 --> 34:42.285
Is it now?

34:42.285 --> 34:44.164
- Mm-hmm.
- [both chuckle]

34:44.164 --> 34:46.377
No, but seriously, I can't. [sighs]

34:46.920 --> 34:49.466
But if you're havin' a good time,
you won't realise.

34:49.466 --> 34:51.178
If I miss it, it's a night bus.

34:51.178 --> 34:53.474
And if I'm lucky enough to survive that,
it's a taxi.

34:53.474 --> 34:55.019
Not an Uber, a taxi.

34:55.019 --> 34:58.819
Yeah, but sometimes you just gotta say,
"I'ma see what happens."

34:59.361 --> 35:01.908
Like, fuck it.
No plannin', balls to the wall,

35:01.908 --> 35:03.620
just go where the breeze takes you.

35:03.620 --> 35:04.956
"I'ma see what happens"?

35:04.956 --> 35:06.543
It's good for the soul, trust.

35:12.053 --> 35:13.055
So?

35:17.565 --> 35:18.567
I got time.

35:22.825 --> 35:25.288
Can I get a cranberry juice,
a pint of lager

35:25.288 --> 35:27.041
and a packet of salt and vinegar?

35:27.041 --> 35:28.545
- [phone ringing]
- Thank you.

35:28.545 --> 35:30.716
- [dance music playing on stereo]
- [patrons chattering]

35:30.716 --> 35:31.801
Yas speaking.

35:31.801 --> 35:34.640
<i>Hey, this is Theresa from Upon Films.
The costume designer.</i>

35:34.640 --> 35:35.934
Oh, hi.

35:35.934 --> 35:40.276
<i>Yeah, sorry to do this, but we're gonna
have to shift you back half an hour?</i>

35:40.276 --> 35:41.361
<i>Is that okay?</i>

35:42.615 --> 35:44.284
- You know what?
- [credit card machine beeps]

35:44.284 --> 35:46.581
- That actually doesn't work for me.
- Thank you.

35:46.581 --> 35:47.792
Is it cool if I reschedule?

35:47.792 --> 35:51.298
<i>Yeah, actually,
we were hoping to make a decision today.</i>

35:51.298 --> 35:52.801
- <i>Sorry.</i>
- Uh, okay.

35:52.801 --> 35:54.555
- Love you. See you later, bye!
- <i>Yeah-- Uh--</i>

35:54.555 --> 35:55.891
- [chuckles, sighs]
- <i>Hello? Hello--</i>

35:55.891 --> 35:57.728
- Who's that?
- Oh, that-that was Cass.

35:58.229 --> 35:59.231
How is she?

36:00.107 --> 36:01.820
Yeah, yeah, better.

36:01.820 --> 36:03.155
Thank you.

36:03.740 --> 36:06.286
Hey, I was, um, I was meaning to ask you.

36:06.286 --> 36:09.167
- Do you really recognise Eric from Tinder?
- Oh. [chuckles] No.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.506
But you just know he's still on there,
huntin'.

36:12.465 --> 36:14.177
I'm guessing you're not on the apps, no?

36:14.177 --> 36:15.639
Nah.

36:15.639 --> 36:17.893
It's Valentine's Day at primary school
all over again.

36:17.893 --> 36:19.814
Oh, wait, let me guess.

36:19.814 --> 36:21.776
Little Dom didn't get any cards.

36:21.776 --> 36:24.030
- No. But you know who did?
- [chuckles]

36:24.030 --> 36:26.451
Lewis Younge, who had pubes at nine

36:26.451 --> 36:28.748
and would punch people
in the nuts for fun.

36:28.748 --> 36:30.669
Why are guys like that
always called Lewis? [laughs]

36:30.669 --> 36:31.754
I know, right?

36:31.754 --> 36:34.426
And now, everyone's only as good
as their profile pic.

36:34.426 --> 36:36.388
We're back to Lewis Younge
and his drawer full of cards.

36:36.388 --> 36:37.558
[inhales deeply]

36:37.558 --> 36:40.856
Oh! You still haven't told me
your break-up story.

36:40.856 --> 36:42.233
Uh, it really isn't that deep.

36:42.233 --> 36:45.031
No, no. You broke up with him
and didn't look back.

36:45.031 --> 36:46.408
That's iconic.

36:46.408 --> 36:47.536
[retches, chuckles]

36:47.536 --> 36:50.584
- 'Ey, 'ey, 'ey.
- [Yas squeaks] Stop. Shut up. [laughs]

36:50.584 --> 36:52.546
No, also-- also, dude, you met my ex.

36:52.546 --> 36:54.967
Ah, oh. Okay. Fine.

36:57.890 --> 37:00.394
We broke up
because of A Tribe Called Quest.

37:01.396 --> 37:02.566
- [Yas's ex] Aw, fuck!
- Oh.

37:02.566 --> 37:04.277
Hey, babe. How's your day been?

37:04.277 --> 37:08.578
Mediocre with a sprinklin' of the entire
universe trying to fuck with me.

37:08.578 --> 37:10.039
Wait, wait, wait.

37:10.039 --> 37:11.208
Jules?

37:11.208 --> 37:12.795
Nathan's mate? The sculptor?

37:12.795 --> 37:13.880
That's your ex?

37:13.880 --> 37:15.007
Oh, he doesn't just sculpt.

37:15.007 --> 37:17.303
He calls himself an artistic polymath,

37:17.303 --> 37:19.517
which is just another term
for being a cunt.

37:19.517 --> 37:21.311
- But, yeah, him.
- [chuckles]

37:21.311 --> 37:22.940
Things were getting kind of stale,

37:22.940 --> 37:27.198
so I decided to try
and get things flowing again, you know?

37:27.198 --> 37:28.618
Reawaken the magic.

37:28.618 --> 37:29.704
Your breath.

37:30.914 --> 37:32.375
That will be the homemade hummus.

37:32.375 --> 37:33.460
- Listen.
- [grunts]

37:33.460 --> 37:36.008
You know how my head gets
when I've been working on something new.

37:36.008 --> 37:37.886
I will take some of that hummus
on a cracker.

37:37.886 --> 37:40.600
Please tell me you dumped his arse
right there and then.

37:40.600 --> 37:41.936
- Yeah!

37:41.936 --> 37:43.523
- Right?
- Get rid of him.

37:43.523 --> 37:47.698
Nope. I took a big L and got this prick
some fucking hummus.

37:47.698 --> 37:51.371
I figured, a few sips of wine, some tunes...

37:51.371 --> 37:54.127
- ["Buggin' Out" playing]
- Wow!

37:54.127 --> 37:56.966
Babe, feeling a bit
sonically sensitive right now.

37:56.966 --> 37:59.764
So, do you mind turning that shit,
like, way down for me?

37:59.764 --> 38:01.642
He called Tribe "that shit"?

38:01.642 --> 38:04.565
You might wanna ration your disdain
because there's more.

38:06.109 --> 38:08.113
Hi. You're blocking the TV.

38:09.032 --> 38:11.537
Oh, okay.

38:11.537 --> 38:14.627
- [groaning, murmuring, coughing]
- [Jules laughs] Interesting.

38:14.627 --> 38:17.381
- Crocs.
- Oh, fuck. Sorry. [chuckles]

38:19.260 --> 38:20.304
[Jules grunts]

38:20.304 --> 38:24.647
You know, I'm gonna forward you an article
about how hip-hop's promotion of violence

38:24.647 --> 38:27.569
continues to perpetuate
problematic Black stereotypes.

38:28.112 --> 38:29.113
[Yas] What?

38:29.113 --> 38:30.199
[Jules moans]

38:31.034 --> 38:32.663
And that's when it hit me.

38:33.915 --> 38:36.044
I had become basic.

38:36.044 --> 38:39.342
So, there and then,
I came up with a simple ethos

38:39.342 --> 38:41.764
to help guide me
through all aspects of my life.

38:43.350 --> 38:44.520
If you make the hummus,

38:45.396 --> 38:46.398
you should get the head.

38:48.152 --> 38:49.487
[Jules grunts] What the fuck?

38:49.487 --> 38:52.326
- Yes!
- [cheering]

38:53.161 --> 38:55.082
- [Jules grunts]
- Yes! Get in, get in.

38:55.082 --> 38:56.418
[laughs]

38:56.418 --> 38:59.592
So while that prick was washing
smooshed up chickpeas out of his pubes,

38:59.592 --> 39:02.221
I packed up any shit I had around there
and bounced.

39:02.221 --> 39:04.518
[cheering]

39:05.729 --> 39:07.148
Only one snag.

39:07.148 --> 39:09.110
In my rush to escape, I forgot--

39:09.110 --> 39:11.239
No. Don't say it.

39:11.239 --> 39:13.953
[Yas] <i>My copy of</i>
The Low End Theory. [sighs]

39:16.876 --> 39:17.920
Do you know what?

39:17.920 --> 39:19.965
You helped me with Gia.
I wanna do this for you.

39:19.965 --> 39:23.388
Let's go find a record shop right now,
and I'll buy you a new copy.

39:23.388 --> 39:24.725
That is really sweet.

39:25.309 --> 39:26.604
But I don't want a new copy.

39:26.604 --> 39:28.440
- I want my copy.
- Oh. [chuckles] Okay.

39:28.440 --> 39:31.404
Why should he get to keep it? Especially
when he doesn't appreciate how good it is.

39:31.404 --> 39:32.490
Have you asked for it back?

39:32.490 --> 39:34.494
So he can make me jump
through a million hoops?

39:34.494 --> 39:36.373
- No, thank you.
- I can go round. Ask for you.

39:36.373 --> 39:39.045
[laughs] Thank you,
but he would love that even more.

39:39.045 --> 39:40.924
Plus, he's not even in the country, so...

39:40.924 --> 39:42.218
Ooh!

39:42.970 --> 39:45.224
- Ooh! [laughs, mumbles]
- What? What?

39:45.224 --> 39:46.309
- Come on.
- Where?

39:46.309 --> 39:48.021
- Come on!
- Oh. O-Okay.

39:48.021 --> 39:50.025
- Yas, Yas.

1:12:06.435 --> 1:12:08.189
I don't think either of us were ready.

1:12:09.233 --> 1:12:13.032
And, um, I guess she still isn't.

1:12:15.203 --> 1:12:16.289
[Eric] Oh, shit.

1:12:16.289 --> 1:12:18.501
Babes,
they're bringin' out the new "canaps."

1:12:18.501 --> 1:12:19.588
- Uh--
- Let's go.

1:12:19.588 --> 1:12:22.134
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

1:12:22.134 --> 1:12:24.180
Go on. Go on.

1:12:25.850 --> 1:12:27.604
Just have a sneaky look.

1:12:27.604 --> 1:12:28.689
No.

1:12:28.689 --> 1:12:30.192
It'll cheer you up.

1:12:30.192 --> 1:12:31.987
Mmm, I'm not looking at your bum.

1:12:31.987 --> 1:12:33.908
It's got healing powers.

1:12:33.908 --> 1:12:35.493
Leave me alone.

1:12:40.503 --> 1:12:42.341
[Cass] That's mine, by the way.

1:12:42.341 --> 1:12:44.763
[phone ringing]

1:12:51.902 --> 1:12:54.365
- [Yas, on phone] <i>Uh, hey.</i>
- Hey.

1:12:54.365 --> 1:12:57.580
[Yas] <i>Um, I was prayin'
that you weren't gonna pick up.</i>

1:12:57.580 --> 1:12:59.793
Thought I'd be too busy
wanking away in my single bed?

1:12:59.793 --> 1:13:03.759
[Yas groans] <i>Turns out, I was the wanker.</i>

1:13:03.759 --> 1:13:05.972
<i>Um, a-are you at Nathan's show?</i>

1:13:05.972 --> 1:13:08.226
Yeah. But you're not.

1:13:08.226 --> 1:13:10.564
[Yas] <i>Actually, I should be by any second.</i>

1:13:10.564 --> 1:13:12.819
Oh, cool. It'd be good to see you.

1:13:12.819 --> 1:13:14.154
- Cheers.
- [Yas] <i>Yeah?</i>

1:13:15.198 --> 1:13:16.492
<i>Turn around.</i>

1:13:18.371 --> 1:13:19.498
[Yas chuckles]

1:13:20.417 --> 1:13:21.545

1:13:29.686 --> 1:13:32.149
Wait, is that you?

1:13:32.149 --> 1:13:33.234
Yeah.

1:13:35.573 --> 1:13:38.161
What are you doin'? You're miles away.

1:13:38.161 --> 1:13:39.539
[Yas] <i>Come down and meet me.</i>

1:13:41.208 --> 1:13:42.962
[ship horn blows]

1:13:44.883 --> 1:13:45.926
Please?

1:13:50.101 --> 1:13:53.191
Listen, I'm really sorry
for all the shit I said. I was a dick.

1:13:53.191 --> 1:13:55.278
I was being overly sensitive.

1:13:55.278 --> 1:13:58.577
Can you stop being nice? Please.
I'm trying to explain.

1:13:59.369 --> 1:14:04.046
The thing is,
that day at Nathan's thing, I just--

1:14:04.631 --> 1:14:06.510
I didn't wanna be sad anymore.

1:14:06.510 --> 1:14:08.806
And so, I lied.

1:14:09.808 --> 1:14:11.895
And then you called me iconic.

1:14:12.396 --> 1:14:15.360
And I liked that you saw me that way,
so I kept on lyin'.

1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:19.994
Come on. It wouldn't have mattered.
I'd think you were cool either way.

1:14:19.994 --> 1:14:21.080
- [Yas] <i>Yeah.</i>
- [Dom chuckles]

1:14:21.080 --> 1:14:22.750
I know that now.

1:14:24.086 --> 1:14:26.090
[Dom, on phone] <i>Maybe we can start over.</i>

1:14:27.425 --> 1:14:31.518
Yas! Wait. Where you going? Yas! Wait!

1:14:31.518 --> 1:14:33.271
I'm on a fucking boat!

1:14:33.271 --> 1:14:34.691
[Dom laughs]

1:14:34.691 --> 1:14:35.818
[chuckles] Sorry. Sorry.

1:14:35.818 --> 1:14:38.030
Why are you on a fucking boat?

1:14:38.030 --> 1:14:41.245
'Cause I figured you deserve
the grand gestures for once, bub.

1:14:41.245 --> 1:14:42.832
- [laughs]
- [Yas laughs]

1:14:44.001 --> 1:14:45.003
What's happening?

1:14:45.003 --> 1:14:49.303
Right. Yeah, I didn't-- I didn't actually
check what route this is taking, so--

1:14:49.303 --> 1:14:50.931
Stay where you are. I'm comin', okay?

1:14:50.931 --> 1:14:52.685
[Yas] <i>I don't really have a choice.</i>

1:14:53.186 --> 1:14:56.275
And just so you know,
I still think you're iconic. [laughs]

1:14:56.275 --> 1:14:57.402
I'm coming, Captain!

1:14:57.402 --> 1:14:59.406

- [chuckles]
- [Yas chuckles]

1:15:41.825 --> 1:15:42.827
Hey.

1:15:43.829 --> 1:15:44.872
Hey.

1:15:47.628 --> 1:15:48.797
So...

1:15:52.262 --> 1:15:54.224
- Do you wanna-- [chuckles]
- Do you fancy-- No. [chuckles]

1:15:54.224 --> 1:15:56.521
You-- You go.

1:15:58.399 --> 1:15:59.902
I was just gonna say, do you wanna--

1:16:10.298 --> 1:16:11.342
[Dom] Go ahead.

1:16:13.137 --> 1:16:15.391
I was just gonna say...

1:16:16.393 --> 1:16:18.147
Do you wanna go for a stroll?

1:16:19.399 --> 1:16:20.694
Yeah.

1:16:20.694 --> 1:16:24.409
But you do have to make
the last train though, right?

1:16:27.248 --> 1:16:28.250
Nah.

1:16:29.252 --> 1:16:31.090
I'ma see what happens.
