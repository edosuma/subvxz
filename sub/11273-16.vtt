WEBVTT

00:09.620 --> 00:11.133
Cheers.

00:12.575 --> 00:14.566
Yes, ma'am, right away.

00:14.823 --> 00:16.575
There's some lady
screaming her head off.

00:16.863 --> 00:17.978
What does she want?

00:18.237 --> 00:20.273
I don't know.
All I could make out was "two-timing."

00:20.942 --> 00:23.137
Sam, telephone.

00:24.855 --> 00:26.891
Woody, listen up
and learn something.

00:29.726 --> 00:31.876
Sammy here.

00:32.305 --> 00:36.777
Oh, hey, I thought you'd like
those flowers.

00:37.135 --> 00:39.888
Yeah. No, no,
that sounds like my note.

00:40.174 --> 00:43.484
"Thanks for a wonderful evening,
Barbara. I had a great time."

00:44.045 --> 00:46.513
Well, of course I know
your name's Karen.

00:49.831 --> 00:52.584
You know, hey,
I see your mistake here.

00:52.870 --> 00:58.581
You see, you didn't realise that,
to me, Barbara means Karen.

00:59.447 --> 01:02.962
Well, because. Because...

01:03.610 --> 01:06.886
Because "Barbara" reminds me
of Barbra Streisand,

01:07.189 --> 01:10.738
and you know that song
about people?

01:11.560 --> 01:13.994
Well, I am getting to it.

01:16.306 --> 01:20.060
You know the line, "First be a person
who needs people"?

01:20.385 --> 01:22.535
Well, who was the first person?

01:22.799 --> 01:25.916
Yeah, all right, but the first
female person was Eve.

01:26.213 --> 01:28.488
And who's the most
famous Eve of all,

01:28.752 --> 01:30.788
but Christmas Eve, right?

01:33.789 --> 01:36.940
Yeah, well, what do you do on
Christmas Eve, but you go carolling.

01:37.244 --> 01:40.202
Right? No, I know,
your name's not Carolyn.

01:40.491 --> 01:42.561
But after you go carolling,

01:42.822 --> 01:47.213
what you do is, you Karen the gifts.

01:49.482 --> 01:51.871
Karen. Yeah.

01:52.146 --> 01:56.378
Well, apology accepted, sweetheart.
I'll talk to you later.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

03:12.500 --> 03:13.569
Hello, everybody.

03:14.042 --> 03:15.157
- Hey.
- Clifford.

03:15.418 --> 03:20.412
Well, Cliff Clavin is here
to bid you all glad tidings

03:20.796 --> 03:23.264
and buy drinks for all my friends.

03:24.256 --> 03:27.612
All right. What's the occasion, Cliffie?
New air-cushion insoles or something?

03:27.967 --> 03:31.482
No, no, no.
Better than that, Normie.

03:31.803 --> 03:34.875
My branch office voted me
Postman of the Year.

03:36.473 --> 03:38.464
It's a very prestigious award too.

03:38.724 --> 03:42.603
Only 267 given out in
the greater Boston area.

03:44.186 --> 03:45.983
- We're very proud of you.
- Yeah.

03:46.228 --> 03:47.820
Will there be a ceremony?

03:48.063 --> 03:49.337
Oh, of course. Yeah, yeah.

03:49.605 --> 03:53.120
As is traditional, to be held
at the gala Postman's Ball.

03:53.482 --> 03:56.042
Yeah, unfortunately it's not
gonna be televised.

03:56.776 --> 03:59.893
I hear it's blacked out
in this area anyway, so...

04:00.904 --> 04:03.896
But I understand the postmaster
general is gonna make the toast.

04:04.406 --> 04:07.603
Wow, a man of his position
helping out in the kitchen.

04:07.950 --> 04:10.020
Only in America.

04:14.662 --> 04:17.699
Excuse me, Diane?
Can I have a word with you?

04:18.790 --> 04:21.065
Of course.

04:23.793 --> 04:26.512
"l, Cliff Clavin, would be ever
so honoured if you,

04:26.794 --> 04:28.989
a lady of exquisite
loveliness and taste,

04:29.588 --> 04:32.386
whom I hold in the highest respect
and esteem,

04:32.714 --> 04:35.706
would accompany me with your
presence at the gala Postman's Ball

04:36.050 --> 04:38.359
on the 1 8th of this month.

04:38.843 --> 04:40.515
You would be doing this
only as a friend.

04:40.803 --> 04:44.034
There is no ulterior motive
or strings attached.

04:44.347 --> 04:46.497
Thank you for listening."

04:48.266 --> 04:50.541
- Cliff, I'd love to.
- You would?

04:50.851 --> 04:53.649
Yes, but I have something else
planned that night.

04:55.228 --> 04:57.947
It's all right. You know, just asked
on the spur of the moment.

05:01.982 --> 05:03.335
I'm sorry, Cliff.

05:03.567 --> 05:04.966
- No.
- I mean it. I am.

05:07.361 --> 05:10.637
- Oh, poor Cliff.
- Why? What happened?

05:10.945 --> 05:13.743
Well, he asked me to his
Postman's Ball,

05:14.072 --> 05:17.542
and I had to tell him I already had
plans for that evening.

05:17.908 --> 05:19.136
What plans?

05:19.410 --> 05:21.844
My cheese club meets that night.

05:22.786 --> 05:26.415
So you're gonna eat cheese
instead of helping Cliff out on this?

05:27.456 --> 05:31.051
We don't only eat cheese.
We talk about eating cheese.

05:34.127 --> 05:36.436
Come on. Obviously, it means
a lot to him.

05:36.712 --> 05:39.067
All he wants to do is be seen
with a classy-looking chick.

05:39.546 --> 05:40.820
Oh, I don't know, Sam.

05:41.047 --> 05:44.483
Look at all the people who've
fallen hopelessly in love with me,

05:44.799 --> 05:48.155
with only the slightest
encouragement.

05:48.468 --> 05:50.857
- You, Frasier...
- Yourself.

05:55.014 --> 05:59.053
- Well, perhaps I was being selfish.
- There you go.

05:59.391 --> 06:01.621
- I'll talk to Cliff the first chance I get.
- Thank you.

06:01.935 --> 06:05.132
Diane was crushed when she found
she couldn't go to the ball with me.

06:05.479 --> 06:07.151
Well, what are you gonna do now,
Mr Clavin?

06:07.438 --> 06:09.827
I'll just have to ask Carla.

06:12.941 --> 06:14.897
Are you nuts?

06:15.151 --> 06:16.982
Carla won't go with you.
She despises you.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.108
Well, just because she despises me,

06:19.362 --> 06:23.480
doesn't mean she can't spend an
evening dining and dancing with me.

06:25.407 --> 06:28.877
Carla...could I ask you a favour?

06:29.201 --> 06:30.919
What?

06:32.661 --> 06:35.494
- Can we talk in the poolroom?
- No.

06:37.457 --> 06:38.856
Carla, that wasn't the favour.

06:39.624 --> 06:41.899
There's more?

06:42.167 --> 06:43.646
What I have to endure.

06:46.337 --> 06:48.726
Now for the kill.

06:55.175 --> 06:58.292
Carla, "l, Cliff Clavin,

07:00.637 --> 07:04.186
would be ever so honoured
if you, a lady of--

07:04.931 --> 07:06.284
A lady...

07:08.266 --> 07:09.824
...would accompany me
with your presence

07:10.059 --> 07:12.493
at the gala Postman's Ball
on the 18th of this month.

07:12.977 --> 07:14.729
You would be doing this
only as a friend.

07:15.020 --> 07:18.535
There is no ulterior motive
or strings attached.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.369
Thank you for listening."

07:28.445 --> 07:30.117
Carla...

07:31.906 --> 07:33.544
Carla...

07:34.449 --> 07:37.361
Carla, this is
really important to me.

07:38.409 --> 07:40.365
I know.

07:40.619 --> 07:42.735
But think of me.

07:45.455 --> 07:50.006
All right, look, Carla, you don't have to
dance with me and I'll buy you a dress.

07:51.917 --> 07:54.033
- Nah.
- A corsage.

07:54.294 --> 07:56.364
A hundred bucks.

07:59.589 --> 08:01.500
- Nah.
- A VCR.

08:05.425 --> 08:07.655
VCR?

08:09.845 --> 08:11.756
Nice touch, but I'll have to pass.

08:18.809 --> 08:21.528
Good Lord. Is that a tear?

08:30.482 --> 08:34.030
Look, I think my greed is overcoming
your repulsiveness.

08:34.568 --> 08:36.798
- I'll go.
- You'll go?

08:37.070 --> 08:38.788
- Oh, Carla--
- First rule:

08:39.071 --> 08:41.585
No physical contact of any kind.

08:41.905 --> 08:45.103
But, Carla, I'm so happy,
I gotta hug something.

08:47.117 --> 08:50.905
Okay, you can hug me for 5 bucks.

08:54.956 --> 08:56.514
That's it.

08:59.208 --> 09:01.005
My pleasure.

09:02.669 --> 09:05.581
Well, got a date with Carla.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.400
- Seriously?
- Are you kidding?

09:07.630 --> 09:11.020
She fell for me
like a sack of cannolis.

09:11.340 --> 09:13.934
Yeah, you gotta love them,
the little wenches.

09:14.425 --> 09:17.064
Oh, Clifford, may I speak with you
for a moment?

09:17.344 --> 09:19.096
Yeah, certainly, Diane.

09:21.554 --> 09:23.590
I've been thinking about it,

09:23.890 --> 09:25.801
and I've decided
to break my engagement

09:26.057 --> 09:28.491
and join you in your evening
of triumph.

09:29.560 --> 09:32.950
- You'll go with me?
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.

09:36.522 --> 09:39.878
Normie, Normie, did you hear that?
Diane will go to the ball with me.

09:40.191 --> 09:43.501
- I'm taking Diane to the ball!
- Cliff, Cliff.

09:43.818 --> 09:46.696
Think just a minute, now.
What's wrong with this picture?

09:46.987 --> 09:49.581
Sam, change for a 20?

09:49.864 --> 09:52.059
What are you talking about?

09:52.698 --> 09:55.292
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

09:55.784 --> 09:58.662
Well, I'll just have to have
a huddle here with the man

09:58.952 --> 10:02.422
who knows almost as much
about women as I do.

10:04.247 --> 10:06.078
- Sammy?
- Yeah?

10:06.331 --> 10:08.447
- A word, if you will.
- What's up?

10:08.750 --> 10:11.218
Well, I seem to have one
of those situations again.

10:11.501 --> 10:14.413
You know, two dollies lined up
for the same evening.

10:14.754 --> 10:18.303
Oh, well, does this have to do with
Diane, Carla and that postman thing?

10:18.631 --> 10:22.419
- Yeah.
- Well, fair's fair. Who said yes first?

10:24.551 --> 10:25.540
Carla.

10:25.802 --> 10:28.032
Well, you just have to tell Diane
you can't go with her.

10:28.345 --> 10:29.698
Make up some excuse.

10:29.971 --> 10:32.280
Tell her that your girl cousin
from Michigan

10:32.555 --> 10:35.353
is in town just for the day
and that you gotta take her.

10:35.682 --> 10:37.161
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

10:37.392 --> 10:39.587
No, she's already heard that one.

10:41.020 --> 10:42.772
Clifford, I've been thinking.

10:43.021 --> 10:47.014
Oh, yeah, you can't go, huh, Diane?
Hey, I understand.

10:47.982 --> 10:49.574
Honestly, you're so insecure.

10:49.816 --> 10:53.365
I was going to say that I thought
of the perfect dress to wear.

10:53.736 --> 10:57.490
Sassy little strapless number,
very graceful for dancing.

10:57.821 --> 11:00.335
With my hair up and a hint of jewellery
to catch the eye.

11:00.906 --> 11:03.659
I'm going to make you very proud.

11:07.952 --> 11:09.908
Now what, Sammy?

11:10.162 --> 11:11.641
Yeah, this is a tough one.

11:11.871 --> 11:14.465
Yeah, if Carla finds out
you asked Diane first,

11:14.747 --> 11:16.703
you're gonna be dead
before you hit the ground.

11:17.958 --> 11:19.186
Hey, hold on a minute.

11:19.459 --> 11:21.734
All you gotta do is,
you gotta find Carla another date.

11:22.002 --> 11:23.401
Someone better than you.

11:23.670 --> 11:26.138
Hey, Sammy, Sammy,
you are a genius.

11:26.422 --> 11:29.414
Well, thank you. Oh, yeah, listen.

11:29.715 --> 11:32.832
When you talk to her about the guy,
be vague. Be general.

11:33.134 --> 11:35.011
Don't get locked into
anybody specific.

11:35.260 --> 11:37.171
All right. Vague. General.

11:39.805 --> 11:41.602
Carla?

11:42.181 --> 11:43.819
How'd you like to go to
the Postman's Ball

11:44.057 --> 11:47.129
with a guy who looks like
Robert Redford and drives a Porsche?

11:48.601 --> 11:49.954
Why aren't I going with you?

11:50.228 --> 11:53.538
Well, see, there's this buddy of mine
down at the P.O.

11:53.855 --> 11:56.972
You might have seen him in here.
He's been in a couple of times.

11:57.274 --> 12:01.187
Well, son of a gun if he didn't say
he's got a big crush on you,

12:02.068 --> 12:05.026
and, well, he wanted me to see
if you'd go to the ball with him. Now--

12:05.362 --> 12:09.071
This isn't just some way of getting
out of giving me the VCR, is it?

12:09.447 --> 12:13.156
No! No, no, no.
You'll get everything I promised.

12:13.825 --> 12:17.454
Plus the bonus of not having
to go out with you,

12:17.786 --> 12:21.904
which leads me to believe that this
guy is a bigger loser than you are.

12:22.247 --> 12:25.444
Just forget it, Clavin!
What kind of girl do you think I am?

12:26.249 --> 12:27.762
One who would like
a big-screen TV?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.479
That's the kind.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.190
Hello, everyone.

12:43.170 --> 12:44.205
Good heavens.

12:44.421 --> 12:46.218
- Miss Chambers, you look beautiful.
- Yeah.

12:46.506 --> 12:49.384
- Thank you, Woody.
- Doesn't she? Boy, you know,

12:49.675 --> 12:53.190
that just opens up the floodgates
to a lot of memories.

12:54.219 --> 12:56.892
Why, thank you, Sam, but I don't
remember us ever going

12:57.180 --> 12:59.410
to a formal occasion
while we were dating.

12:59.723 --> 13:02.795
No, I was thinking about the girl
I took to my high school prom.

13:04.977 --> 13:07.013
Just kidding. Just kidding.

13:07.812 --> 13:09.848
Miss Chambers,
can I tell you something?

13:10.147 --> 13:11.944
Sure, Woody.

13:12.190 --> 13:14.306
You look like a hundred bucks.

13:20.613 --> 13:22.126
Thank you, Woody.

13:22.406 --> 13:24.362
Oh, what am I saying?
Two hundred.

13:26.075 --> 13:28.111
Woody, you're turning my head.

13:28.785 --> 13:30.218
Okay, a hundred.

13:31.454 --> 13:33.445
Oh, look out.
Here comes your boyfriend.

13:44.463 --> 13:47.899
Everybody, I'd like you to meet Lucas.
Lucas, the gang.

13:52.927 --> 13:56.761
Right. He said hello. You see, Lucas
is sort of used to talking to himself.

13:58.556 --> 14:01.434
Lucas, you wanna step on down to
the bar and have something to drink?

14:10.857 --> 14:14.850
- Oh, Diane, you look beautiful.
- Thank you.

14:15.235 --> 14:19.706
Oh, this is for you.
Just a little token of my affection.

14:22.782 --> 14:24.932
Thank you, Clifford.

14:25.659 --> 14:29.891
If you don't mind my asking, who is
this Lucas fellow, and why is he here?

14:30.287 --> 14:32.847
Oh, well, we're gonna double
with him and his date...

14:33.831 --> 14:35.310
...Carla.

14:37.459 --> 14:41.452
Carla? Well, I guess
they're a match.

14:42.921 --> 14:46.072
Although he does look like he's
been around a mushroom or two.

14:50.593 --> 14:53.266
Oh, Cliff.

14:58.724 --> 15:00.715
Gee, this is...

15:01.434 --> 15:02.947
...big.

15:03.686 --> 15:06.120
Big and beautiful.

15:06.396 --> 15:08.432
Yeah, why don't you try it on.

15:08.731 --> 15:13.680
Oh, no, no, something this big
and beautiful should be preserved.

15:14.110 --> 15:15.543
Oh, don't worry about that, Diane.

15:15.777 --> 15:18.291
That's guaranteed to last
through a 20-knot wind.

15:26.076 --> 15:30.354
Sorry I'm late.
The baby spit up on my dress.

15:31.080 --> 15:34.038
I had to buy a brooch
big enough to cover it.

15:34.332 --> 15:38.041
Real diamond chips.
Seventy-five bucks.

15:43.297 --> 15:47.256
What is whitey doing here
dressed like that?

15:49.009 --> 15:51.887
Diane's the only date I could
scrape up at the last minute.

15:52.387 --> 15:55.697
Oh, yeah?
What are you paying her?

15:56.890 --> 16:01.759
- Transistor radio.
- A cheap date. I knew it.

16:08.940 --> 16:11.932
Carla, don't you wanna
meet your date?

16:13.026 --> 16:15.665
I thought he was supposed to look
like Robert Redford.

16:16.112 --> 16:19.309
Well, he does from a distance.

16:19.989 --> 16:22.662
Yeah, Mars.

16:22.950 --> 16:27.307
And I think you'll soon find out
just why a planet came to mind.

16:31.914 --> 16:36.590
Carla, I'd like you to meet Lucas.
Lucas, your date, Carla.

16:43.047 --> 16:44.321
What did he say?

16:44.548 --> 16:46.140
I can't believe it matters.

16:51.386 --> 16:54.822
Well, I can see this is gonna be
a laugh a minute.

16:55.139 --> 16:59.769
An evening with the stick, the nerd
and door number three.

17:01.310 --> 17:03.983
You kids have a great time.

17:05.896 --> 17:07.569
Good night.

17:08.982 --> 17:11.290
Jimmy! Yo!

17:17.238 --> 17:21.628
Well, you two seem to be
getting on pretty well.

17:31.373 --> 17:36.288
Yeah, well, I sure hate to have
to admit this, Clavin,

17:36.668 --> 17:39.421
but tall, dark and gruesome here...

17:40.421 --> 17:43.413
...turned out to be a real groove.

17:46.550 --> 17:50.543
Not a great dancer, though.
He mashed in the toes of my shoes.

17:50.887 --> 17:52.320
I'll bill you for a new pair.

17:52.596 --> 17:55.429
I don't believe this.
You should be buying me a VCR.

17:58.058 --> 18:01.733
Just wait a minute. You're not gonna
welsh on our deal, are you?

18:02.103 --> 18:04.776
Carla, come on, will you?
You're making out like a bandit here.

18:06.398 --> 18:08.548
At least you're getting
some loving tonight.

18:08.858 --> 18:12.533
Boy, I made the wrong choice
between you and Diane.

18:15.654 --> 18:16.882
What did you say?

18:19.323 --> 18:23.441
I said you and Diane
look really choice tonight.

18:26.036 --> 18:29.995
I see. So where is the stick anyway?

18:30.373 --> 18:34.605
She's just going to freshen up.
She'll be out in a couple of minutes.

18:34.959 --> 18:38.110
You know, I never would have
thought it. You two.

18:38.462 --> 18:40.418
What are you talking about?

18:40.672 --> 18:43.664
Look, I shouldn't be telling you this,

18:43.966 --> 18:46.560
but when you two guys
went to get some punch,

18:46.843 --> 18:50.756
Diane told me that she wished
you'd come on a little stronger.

18:54.306 --> 18:57.457
In fact, she said that she wished

18:57.767 --> 19:01.442
that you would do the one thing to her
that no man has ever done.

19:01.770 --> 19:03.203
I mean, not even Sammy.

19:03.771 --> 19:06.285
- The one thing that makes her crazy.
- What? What?

19:10.943 --> 19:13.332
Just out of curiosity.

19:13.862 --> 19:16.535
Run your fingers
up and down her arm,

19:16.822 --> 19:20.451
Iook into her eyes and sing "Misty."

19:23.368 --> 19:25.086
Sorry to hold you up.

19:33.584 --> 19:36.576
Well, let's be on our way, Clifford.

19:51.388 --> 19:55.267
Clifford, I want you to know
that I liked your speech best.

19:55.641 --> 19:59.111
Out of all 267.

20:00.311 --> 20:03.189
- Really?
- Absolutely.

20:04.731 --> 20:09.361
Listen, Diane, I want to thank you
for keeping up the act tonight.

20:09.734 --> 20:11.247
You know, staying by my side.

20:12.528 --> 20:14.325
It wasn't entirely an act, Cliff.

20:14.780 --> 20:18.409
I think tonight was the first time
I saw you with your guard down.

20:18.741 --> 20:22.859
You were yourself, not some
mutation of Sam Malone,

20:23.202 --> 20:27.559
trying to impress people
with tales of sexual exploits.

20:27.914 --> 20:29.711
Women don't really like that, Cliff.

20:30.916 --> 20:33.555
They want men to be
sweet and vulnerable.

20:34.043 --> 20:36.398
Then how come Sammy
always scores?

20:36.712 --> 20:38.748
Because he's gorgeous.

20:39.464 --> 20:42.217
I mean, he has low standards.

20:42.507 --> 20:45.340
He'll go out with any floozy
who comes down the pike.

20:45.635 --> 20:48.308
Speaking of pike,
how come we're not on it?

20:48.595 --> 20:51.712
Well, I wanted to take
the long way home.

20:52.014 --> 20:53.606
Yeah...

20:54.349 --> 20:57.022
...I just had the time
of my life tonight,

20:57.310 --> 20:58.902
and I don't want it to end.

20:59.144 --> 21:01.374
I just want to feel the night wind
in my hair

21:01.646 --> 21:04.365
and share the company
of you good people.

21:10.402 --> 21:12.836
I think it's wonderful, Cliff.

21:13.112 --> 21:17.230
Yeah, I think tonight was
a real breakthrough for you.

21:17.574 --> 21:21.249
Perhaps we've seen the end of the old
insecure, arrested adolescent...

21:22.869 --> 21:26.225
...and we're seeing the emergence
of the real Cliff Clavin.

21:30.583 --> 21:31.811
- What?
- Darn.

21:32.042 --> 21:35.398
- What? What's wrong?
- We ran out of gas.

21:37.421 --> 21:41.096
Well, the gauge reads half full.

21:41.424 --> 21:44.780
Yeah, yeah, it always reads half full.
It's stuck there.

21:45.093 --> 21:49.371
I guess in the excitement of the night,
I just forgot to fill the tank.

21:51.806 --> 21:53.876
Well, what are we going to do?

21:54.141 --> 21:58.180
We're miles from a gas station.

22:14.531 --> 22:18.319
Look at me

22:20.368 --> 22:24.805
I'm as helpless as a kitten in a tree

22:25.163 --> 22:27.518
And I'm clinging to a cloud

22:27.832 --> 22:31.029
I can't understand

22:31.334 --> 22:33.484
I get misty

22:33.961 --> 22:38.830
Just holding your hand

22:41.091 --> 22:43.651
Walk my way

22:43.926 --> 22:45.917
Get out.

22:46.386 --> 22:49.583
- And a thousand vio--
- Now.

22:50.806 --> 22:52.603
Yes, ma'am.

22:56.518 --> 22:58.668
Diane, look, I'm sorry.
You don't understand.

22:58.937 --> 23:01.212
I don't know what happened
to me tonight.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.675
The wine must have
gone to my head, Diane.

23:03.940 --> 23:06.500
Look, you know I hold you
in the highest respect and esteem,

23:06.776 --> 23:10.928
and I would never, ever do anything
to upset you.

23:12.071 --> 23:16.189
Well, running out of gas? Really!

23:16.533 --> 23:20.367
- Well, we did run out of gas, Diane.
- Clifford.

23:20.702 --> 23:25.617
Well, look, would a sign
from God convince you?

23:26.248 --> 23:28.125
Maybe.

23:28.541 --> 23:30.816
All right.

23:31.293 --> 23:33.648
Almighty God...

23:34.795 --> 23:40.506
...please, if I'm telling the truth about
this car running out of gas tonight,

23:41.300 --> 23:44.292
Iet it start now, even on an empty tank.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Diane, hallelujah!

23:48.001 --> 23:51.000
Oh, hallelujah! Diane! Oh, hey!
