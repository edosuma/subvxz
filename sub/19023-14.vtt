(J.D.) <i>When you're</i>

00:04.959 --> 00:07.542
<i>even waking up</i>

00:08.959 --> 00:10.166
Good morning.

(J.D.) <i>The air feels crisper,</i>

00:14.458 --> 00:17.375

00:17.458 --> 00:19.542
You taste like old eggs.

00:19.625 --> 00:21.375
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

00:21.458 --> 00:23.959
(whispering)
I love old eggs.

00:27.959 --> 00:31.166
You are so different from the guys
I usually go out with.

00:32.291 --> 00:34.667
-How so?
-Oh. For starters...

00:36.500 --> 00:37.917
I'm still wearing pants.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.917
Yeah. Well, that is
because I respect you.

00:42.041 --> 00:43.041
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

00:43.125 --> 00:46.166
And also this triple knot
I couldn't get out. Arr!

00:46.250 --> 00:48.333
Hey, thanks for being
so patient with me.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.542
I hope you don't think
I'm a big tease.

00:51.625 --> 00:55.291
I just... I love sleeping
in the same bed with you.

00:55.375 --> 00:57.542
I've never slept better,
you know?

01:03.375 --> 01:05.417
Me neither.

01:05.500 --> 01:06.959
You know, in fact,
I'll go ahead and say it.

01:07.041 --> 01:08.166
I hope we
never have sex.

01:08.250 --> 01:13.125
What would you say if I told you
that I feel ready right now?

01:19.792 --> 01:21.041
Whatever.

01:21.125 --> 01:23.166
Oh, okay. Then I think tonight
we should get a nice bottle--

01:23.250 --> 01:25.834
Yeah, tonight is good,
but I think now, also good.

01:25.917 --> 01:28.542
Yeah. Now works. Sure.

01:33.041 --> 01:35.917
Now, that's what
I'm talking about.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.375
Get out!

01:37.458 --> 01:39.333
7:15, y'all.
Gotta go to work. Let's go!

01:42.542 --> 01:46.625

(J.D.) <i>Since Alex is a social worker,</i>

01:58.959 --> 02:00.667

02:03.000 --> 02:05.083
You're on my foot.

02:05.166 --> 02:08.208
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

02:08.291 --> 02:11.000
Oof. No, please.
Step on my foot.

02:11.083 --> 02:12.792
I'm just waitin' for an excuse.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.709
Not today.

02:14.792 --> 02:17.291
Really? Why not?

02:19.458 --> 02:21.333
Oh, I get it.

02:21.417 --> 02:22.667
Nice pull. Thanks.

02:22.750 --> 02:24.041
Slept with her yet?

02:24.959 --> 02:25.959
What?

02:26.041 --> 02:28.959
I'm, I am not discussing that
with you.

02:29.041 --> 02:31.250
-That's a no.
-Listen, jolly green.

02:31.333 --> 02:33.458
People's personal lives
are just that.

02:33.542 --> 02:36.542
-They're personal.
-That's a definite no.

02:38.041 --> 02:39.667
It's good to see you again,
Mr. Barnes.

02:39.750 --> 02:41.667
We'll be with you in a moment.

02:41.750 --> 02:43.667
Put him in bed 6.

02:44.583 --> 02:46.291
Tell me, Laverne,

02:46.375 --> 02:48.709
are you, in fact,
part golden retriever?

02:48.792 --> 02:49.875
Keep it holy now.

02:49.959 --> 02:52.458
I only ask because every time
I toss this guy,

02:52.542 --> 02:54.166
you bring him right back to me.

02:55.333 --> 02:57.458
All right, <i>Will &amp; Grace</i>.
Breakdown.

02:57.542 --> 02:59.166
Judging by Mr. Barnes'
elevated lipase,

02:59.250 --> 03:00.417
I'd say it's pancreatitis.

03:00.500 --> 03:02.375
Okay. Grace,
you wanna finish?

03:02.458 --> 03:04.041
Start him on a
Demerol drip and--

03:04.125 --> 03:05.375
Oh, the throbbing's back.

03:05.458 --> 03:07.208
Mr. Barnes has been admitted
for substance abuse

03:07.291 --> 03:08.625
3 times in the past year.

03:08.709 --> 03:09.875
Yeah, but he said he quit.

03:09.959 --> 03:12.417
Oh, the addict said he quit?

03:12.500 --> 03:13.875
Why wouldn't you
tell me something like that?

03:13.959 --> 03:16.583
'Cause don't you see?
That changes everything.

03:16.667 --> 03:17.583
I believe in Mr. Barnes.

03:17.667 --> 03:20.041
Lookit, newbie, just because
you have a new girlfriend

03:20.125 --> 03:21.500
doesn't mean that the world

03:21.583 --> 03:23.875
has suddenly turned
into a giant green M&amp;M.

03:23.959 --> 03:26.458
The Red Sox still suck.
They do.

03:26.542 --> 03:28.709
Barbie here still
can't decide what to do

03:28.792 --> 03:30.208
with those annoying bangs,

03:30.291 --> 03:33.041
and addicts everywhere
will still lie, cheat,

03:33.125 --> 03:34.542
and steal just to get a fix.

03:34.625 --> 03:37.500
Now, you've got to wake up,
sweetheart.

03:37.583 --> 03:41.458
You're gonna be late for school.
Aw, you wet the bed.

03:41.542 --> 03:45.250
Why can't I have a normal child,
without these problems?

03:46.583 --> 03:49.834
My mom says
they frame my face.

03:49.917 --> 03:51.709
They don't.

03:52.875 --> 03:55.125
Oh, wait. Please!
Wait. Wait. Wait.

03:55.208 --> 03:56.875
Wait! Wait. Wait.

03:56.959 --> 04:00.917
Go, bus.
Go! Go. Go. Go.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.083
Yeah! Yes!

04:10.041 --> 04:13.458
She didn't see you, Bob.
Just stay perfectly still.

04:14.750 --> 04:16.291
Dr. Kelso?

04:16.375 --> 04:18.291
(knocks on glass)

04:21.375 --> 04:22.917
Can I get a ride
to the hospital?

04:23.000 --> 04:26.709
Oh, of course, dear.
Glad to do it.

04:33.792 --> 04:36.542
Dr. Cox and I have been friends
for a long time.

04:36.625 --> 04:38.792
You should get to know him.

04:41.333 --> 04:42.500
Do I have to?

04:42.583 --> 04:44.166
Yeah, you have to.

04:46.417 --> 04:48.333
In case you were wondering,

04:48.417 --> 04:51.834
it says "if you can read this,

04:51.917 --> 04:54.583
you're standing too close."

04:54.667 --> 04:58.083
No, I wasn't trying to,
you know, look--

04:58.166 --> 05:02.375
Now let's see if you can tinkle
when someone's staring at you.

05:05.208 --> 05:07.041
Yeah, go ahead
and take your time.

05:07.125 --> 05:09.250
I actually have all day.

05:09.959 --> 05:11.375
(whispering)
Come on.

05:11.458 --> 05:14.333
Now, I've been Mr. Barnes'
case worker for a long time.

05:14.417 --> 05:16.959
He just needs everyone
to cut him some slack, you know?

05:17.041 --> 05:20.208
Yeah. Hey, let me get
this door for you.

05:20.291 --> 05:23.959
I mean, people just
don't understand addiction.

05:24.041 --> 05:26.000
Why are we in the on-call room?

05:27.250 --> 05:29.125
Oh.

05:29.208 --> 05:33.000
So, have you, uh,
ever fooled around in here?

05:33.083 --> 05:35.375
Yeah, lots of times.

05:35.458 --> 05:37.458
Never with anyone, but...

05:37.542 --> 05:40.542
-Would you like to change that?
-Yes, please.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.291
Oh, hey. Hey, Elliot.

05:52.375 --> 05:55.458
Um, can you come back
in, like, 2 minutes?

05:55.542 --> 05:57.959
Hmm?
Or, like, 80 minutes?

05:58.041 --> 06:00.291
I just wanted to tell you the nurses
did a check of the narcotics drawer,

06:00.375 --> 06:01.834
and there's 50 Percocet missing.

06:01.917 --> 06:04.792
What we should do is split up into
teams and search every room.

06:04.875 --> 06:06.542
We'll take this one.

06:08.041 --> 06:09.500
Fine.

06:10.083 --> 06:11.792
You know they're gonna go
right to Mr. Barnes.

06:11.875 --> 06:14.041
I'm gonna go check on him, okay?

06:15.458 --> 06:18.291
-Uh, Alex?
-What?

06:18.375 --> 06:20.792
I just don't like it
when you leave.

06:20.875 --> 06:22.125
Come here.

06:24.583 --> 06:28.458
Tonight we'll pick up
right where we left off.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.834
20 bucks says
it never happens.

06:36.875 --> 06:38.500
What, you're offended?

06:39.709 --> 06:41.500
Hey, Bob. How are ya?

06:41.583 --> 06:42.834
Fine, Allan.

06:42.917 --> 06:46.792
Uh, today I think
I'll try a double half-caf

06:46.875 --> 06:49.792
multi-foam latte mochaccino
with a shot of vanilla

06:49.875 --> 06:51.375
and a sprinkle of nutmeg.

06:51.458 --> 06:54.041
-So, black coffee?
-Bingo-bango.

06:56.375 --> 06:59.250
Oh, my God.
These people actually like you.

06:59.333 --> 07:01.583
Maybe you should just order.

07:01.667 --> 07:05.125
Yes. I'll have an Espresso,
please. And...

07:06.041 --> 07:08.166
What kind of scones
do you have today?

07:08.250 --> 07:10.417
Ahem.

07:10.500 --> 07:14.000
Son of a bitch. Do you mind, lady?
I am in a rush.

07:14.542 --> 07:16.959
Oh, my goodness!
I'm so sorry.

07:17.041 --> 07:18.750
What am I doing,
thinking I can take

07:18.834 --> 07:20.625
an extra 6 seconds
to pick my breakfast?

07:20.709 --> 07:22.041
I'm gonna have
to call my mom

07:22.125 --> 07:24.250
and tell her she did
a lousy job raising me.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.750
Thank you so much.

07:27.333 --> 07:30.041
I, um, I think
what she means is,

07:30.125 --> 07:32.834
she doesn't give
a crapuccino.

07:34.917 --> 07:39.208
Allan, this is on me.
God help me, I love spunk.

07:43.291 --> 07:45.917
Hey. How ya doin'?

07:46.709 --> 07:49.083
Oh, hey. How are you?
Can I buy you a beer?

07:49.166 --> 07:51.583
This is a men's room
for God's sake.

07:51.667 --> 07:54.625
There is absolutely
no talking in here. Ever.

07:54.709 --> 07:56.041
It's just so freaky, you know?

07:56.125 --> 07:57.917
We're on the same pee schedule.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
No, we're not.

08:00.083 --> 08:03.000
No, we're not. No. No.

08:24.625 --> 08:25.709
(J.D.)
<i>This is not good.</i>

08:25.792 --> 08:28.333
Why would you assume
Mr. Barnes stole the Percocet?

08:28.417 --> 08:29.458
There's lots of people
on that ward.

08:29.542 --> 08:30.500
That's a good point.

08:30.583 --> 08:32.291
Yeah, and 3 of them
are in comas,

08:32.375 --> 08:34.166
2 others can't walk,
and one's a nun.

08:34.250 --> 08:35.834
Also a very valid point.

08:35.917 --> 08:40.458
Look, Elliot, I'm sure
Mr. Barnes didn't take the drugs.

08:40.542 --> 08:43.041
He's been in rehab
for over 6 months.

08:43.125 --> 08:45.542
There's no reason to be
so judgmental.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.750
I am not judgmental.

08:47.834 --> 08:50.417
If I were, I'd tell you
your shoes are ugly.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.667
Do not stoop to her level.

08:54.083 --> 08:56.709
Your bangs make you look
like a chipmunk.

08:56.792 --> 08:59.417
It's a frame.
Why can nobody see that?

08:59.500 --> 09:00.875
Can we get back
to the matter at hand?

09:00.959 --> 09:02.291
This is about Mr. Barnes.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.875
-Fine. So who do you think's right?
-Yeah?

09:05.959 --> 09:08.083
(J.D.)
<i>Oh, crap.</i>

09:10.667 --> 09:12.417
Aw, for the love of Oprah.

09:12.500 --> 09:15.250
Why, why, why would
you come to pediatrics?

09:15.333 --> 09:17.166
'Cause I can't go
unless you're around.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.792
You're my little pee buddy.

09:20.375 --> 09:22.625
What do you say
we cut to the chase?

09:23.417 --> 09:25.792
You're datin' Carla,
the one person in this hospital

09:25.875 --> 09:27.875
I can remotely stand,

09:27.959 --> 09:30.250
and she wants us to get
all kissy face with each other.

09:30.333 --> 09:32.417
I get it. I do.

09:32.500 --> 09:36.041
But you see, every single time
I shake my magic eight ball

09:36.125 --> 09:38.542
and ask it "are we gonna be
best friends forever?"

09:38.625 --> 09:42.333
Do you know what it says?
Outlook is buh-leak.

09:42.417 --> 09:44.750
Well, Dr. Cox,
you really can't trust those things.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.417
I mean, when I was 9,
I asked mine

09:46.500 --> 09:48.458
if I should crack it open
and drink the fluid inside.

09:48.542 --> 09:51.625
I puked blue
for, like, 3 days.

09:51.709 --> 09:55.291
Just a real cute story.
Here's what you're gonna do.

09:55.375 --> 09:57.041
Go back to Carla
and don't obsess

09:57.125 --> 09:58.792
about why she's with you
in the first place.

09:58.875 --> 10:01.166
Just tell her
we went to a ball game,

10:01.250 --> 10:03.083
and we borrowed
each other's sweaters.

10:03.166 --> 10:05.208
Okay, little buddy?

10:05.667 --> 10:08.041
-What a--
-(toilet flushes)

10:08.125 --> 10:10.875
Well, I don't think
we should stand for it.

10:10.959 --> 10:13.125
Dr. Kelso can't just decide

10:13.208 --> 10:15.291
we're not allowed to switch
shifts anymore.

10:15.375 --> 10:17.750
I was supposed to go see
my nephew tonight in<i> Pippin.</i>

10:17.834 --> 10:20.500
-Who is he playin'?
-Pippin.

10:21.166 --> 10:24.792
Bob Kelso is a bad man.

10:24.875 --> 10:27.125
I don't know.
I mean, we never think about

10:27.208 --> 10:29.375
how hard it is to always be
the bad guy, ya know?

10:29.458 --> 10:34.083
I want him to die.
Hello, sweetness.

10:34.166 --> 10:36.834
Ladies. Carla,
I was thinking about

10:36.917 --> 10:39.000
what you said this morning
about your mother's birthday,

10:39.083 --> 10:40.959
and I don't want her
spending it alone,

10:41.041 --> 10:43.083
so I've arranged
for you to swap shifts

10:43.166 --> 10:44.417
with a nurse on the third floor.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.000
Oh, Dr. Kelso--

10:46.083 --> 10:47.083
Don't mention it.

10:47.166 --> 10:49.542
And should I pick you up tomorrow
morning at the same place?

10:49.625 --> 10:50.625
Um--

10:50.709 --> 10:55.125
Great. Good-bye,
all you smiling faces.

10:59.917 --> 11:02.417
So, who'd you side with,
Elliot or Alex?

11:02.500 --> 11:04.709
Neither.
I just pretended I was paged.

11:04.792 --> 11:06.083
Then when they said
they didn't hear anything,

11:06.166 --> 11:07.792
I called them both liars
and ran away.

11:07.875 --> 11:08.875
-Smooth.
-Yeah.

11:08.959 --> 11:10.125
You know,
they both have a point.

11:10.208 --> 11:12.208
-Stick to the Booty principle.
-What's that?

11:12.291 --> 11:14.208
The Booty principle.
Which one do you wanna sleep with?

11:14.291 --> 11:15.542
Alex.

11:15.625 --> 11:18.417
Then I think she might be right.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.417
(J.D.)
<i>I'm not sure about Turk's advice.</i>

11:21.500 --> 11:23.291
<i>I mean, sometimes</i>
<i>he oversimplifies things.</i>

11:23.375 --> 11:25.750
<i>Especially when it comes to booty.</i>

11:26.250 --> 11:31.125
What would you say if I told you
I feel ready right now?

11:31.709 --> 11:33.000
I agree with Alex.

11:33.583 --> 11:35.333
Yeah, I've been thinking
about it a lot.

11:35.417 --> 11:38.166
And I think that, you know,
she's right about Mr. Barnes.

11:38.250 --> 11:42.709
-We can't just jump to conclusions.
-Oh, I am so surprised.

11:42.792 --> 11:44.875
Hey, tell me something.

11:44.959 --> 11:47.125
What do you think about Alex?

11:47.208 --> 11:49.083
No way.
I'm not saying anything

11:49.166 --> 11:50.667
about a girl that
you're sleeping with.

11:50.750 --> 11:53.250
He's not sleeping with her.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.583
I'm serious.
Look. No ramifications.

11:56.667 --> 11:59.000
-Nothing. Just tell me--
-I don't like her. I don't trust her.

11:59.083 --> 12:01.041
And I'm afraid that
she's gonna hurt you.

12:01.125 --> 12:03.750
-You're jealous.
-Oh, shut up.

12:03.834 --> 12:06.792
So shut up because
you're so jealous of her

12:06.875 --> 12:09.375
that you don't even care
that I'm happy for once.

12:09.959 --> 12:12.500
Do you honestly believe
that's what's going on here?

12:12.583 --> 12:15.125
(J.D.)
<i>Do not, under any circumstances,</i>

12:15.208 --> 12:17.000
<i>say what you're thinking.</i>

12:17.959 --> 12:20.375
I'm sorry, but you had
your chance with me.

12:26.959 --> 12:29.000
(J.D.)
<i>Why don't I ever listen to me?</i>

12:37.709 --> 12:39.750
(J.D.)<i> You know what?</i>
<i>Don't worry about yesterday</i>

12:39.834 --> 12:42.834
<i>Elliot's not the type of girl</i>
<i>that holds a grudge.</i>

12:43.917 --> 12:45.583
<i>Then again...</i>

12:47.583 --> 12:50.917
You see, I think that
you should tell your neighbor

12:51.000 --> 12:53.291
that you will hang your hammock
wherever you damn well please,

12:53.375 --> 12:55.667
and if she doesn't like it,
she can just move.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.291
Well, that's what I like
about you, Carla.

12:57.375 --> 13:00.250
You don't give a rat's ass
what anybody thinks.

13:01.208 --> 13:03.625
(woman 1) Morning, Dr. Kelso.

13:04.125 --> 13:07.959
Nurses. Oh, get up.

13:10.750 --> 13:12.917
I wanna apologize for not
showing up last night.

13:13.041 --> 13:17.208
I got home, I sat on the couch.
I just totally passed out.

13:17.834 --> 13:21.083
You know, I wasn't even sure
we had a definite plan, so...

13:25.625 --> 13:28.375
Anyway, I'm sorry
I couldn't make it.

13:34.333 --> 13:38.000
She seems sorry.
I am, too.

13:39.625 --> 13:41.792
Someone call
for a surgical consult?

13:43.000 --> 13:44.667
-You're Dr. Turk?
-Mm-hmm.

13:44.750 --> 13:47.083
Of course you are.
Note to self:

13:47.166 --> 13:49.166
You've got to start
writing down the names

13:49.250 --> 13:51.583
of people that truly annoy you.

13:51.667 --> 13:54.041
Yeah. Yeah.
Um, what's up?

13:54.125 --> 13:55.625
This guy has
2 vessel disease,

13:55.709 --> 13:56.959
and he hasn't been tried
on medical management,

13:57.041 --> 13:58.000
so he's got a couple options...

13:58.083 --> 14:00.625
(J.D.) <i>When an attending</i>
<i>calls a lowly intern for a consult,</i>

14:00.709 --> 14:03.041
<i>it's an unwritten law</i>
<i>that the intern should agree</i>

14:03.125 --> 14:04.917
<i>with whatever he says.</i>

14:05.500 --> 14:07.125
Don't you agree?

14:07.208 --> 14:11.291
Actually, sir, uh,
I recommend bypass surgery.

14:12.208 --> 14:14.542
Wow, that's my pager.

14:14.625 --> 14:18.041
You're wrong.
He's so wrong.

14:18.667 --> 14:21.709
You make me so angry, I...

14:21.792 --> 14:24.542
I...
I have to pee.

14:28.500 --> 14:29.667
Me, too.

14:29.750 --> 14:33.041
(J.D.) <i>Look at her. She's</i>
<i>not even gonna say hi to me.</i>

14:33.125 --> 14:36.709
<i>Fine, I won't say hi to her.</i>
<i>Ever.</i>

14:36.792 --> 14:38.041
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>how stubborn she is.</i>

14:38.125 --> 14:39.875
<i>She's not even</i>
<i>moving out of the way.</i>

14:39.959 --> 14:42.750
<i>I am the wrong man</i>
<i>to play chicken with, missy.</i>

14:42.834 --> 14:46.041
<i>She'll blink.</i>
<i>Any second now.</i>

14:48.458 --> 14:50.291
She is so stubborn.

14:50.375 --> 14:52.375
Laverne, could you
hand me some gauze, please?

14:52.458 --> 14:54.917
Maybe Dr. Kelso can pick you up
in the morning

14:55.000 --> 14:56.917
and take you to the gauze store.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.250
All right, now listen.

14:58.333 --> 15:01.625
Carla, this paperwork
has your signature on it,

15:01.709 --> 15:03.875
and it is totally subpar.

15:04.875 --> 15:08.333
I won't stand for this kind
of shoddy work.

15:11.875 --> 15:13.375
Let me help you, honey.

15:19.458 --> 15:20.500
All right. So you
went behind my back

15:20.583 --> 15:22.333
and got an intern
to agree with you

15:22.375 --> 15:23.667
so the guy doesn't get surgery.

15:23.750 --> 15:25.458
Oh, no. Ya caught me.

15:25.542 --> 15:27.625
Cox, a bypass is the right call.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.291
Considering the inherent
risk in surgery--

15:29.375 --> 15:31.291
the guy is a diabetic
with 2 vessel disease--

15:31.375 --> 15:34.667
Anti-anginals could be
equally effective.

15:34.750 --> 15:36.208
So we agree that either treatment
could work?

15:36.291 --> 15:37.125
Yeah, sure.

15:37.208 --> 15:39.417
-Then what the hell are we arguing about?
-Hey.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.250
-Hey, baby.
-Hi, sweetie.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.834
(J.D.) <i>And it was just</i>
<i>then that they realized</i>

15:44.917 --> 15:46.583
<i>what was really going on.</i>

15:47.625 --> 15:51.291
Dr. Cox was in love
with Turk's girlfriend.

15:51.375 --> 15:52.667
Either one of you want half
a sandwich?

15:52.750 --> 15:54.333
I'm all set.

15:58.834 --> 16:01.959
So every Tox screen came back
negative on Mr. Barnes.

16:02.542 --> 16:04.333
He didn't take anything.

16:04.375 --> 16:07.417
-So?
-So, you were wrong.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.333
It's not about that
anymore, is it?

16:12.250 --> 16:13.375
(J.D.) <i>When you can't</i>
<i>make things right</i>

16:13.458 --> 16:16.875
<i>with one of your best friends,</i>
<i>nothing can make you feel better.</i>

16:16.959 --> 16:19.333
Hey, I'm finally off.

16:19.417 --> 16:21.750
Do you wanna get out of here?

16:21.834 --> 16:23.333
(cell phone rings)

16:23.417 --> 16:26.041
-Hello?
-So, are we doing this, or what?

16:28.875 --> 16:31.709
-(Carla) Dr. Kelso.
-Yes, what is it?

16:31.792 --> 16:35.792
I wanted to thank you.
For what you did.

16:35.875 --> 16:37.417
You know, when
you yelled at me

16:37.500 --> 16:40.458
in front of the other nurses,
I appreciate it.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.834
Young lady, I yelled at you

16:42.917 --> 16:44.709
because that paperwork
looked like

16:44.792 --> 16:47.250
it had been done
by a drunk 4-year-old.

16:47.834 --> 16:51.041
Listen, Carla. I have a family
who loves me,

16:51.125 --> 16:52.750
a handful of close friends,

16:52.834 --> 16:55.500
and a wonderful hobby shop
in my basement.

16:55.583 --> 16:57.250
I don't spend
much time worrying

16:57.333 --> 16:59.583
about people's feelings around here.

16:59.667 --> 17:02.291
I just do whatever
makes me happy.

17:03.625 --> 17:04.875
So...

17:05.917 --> 17:07.667
Can I still get a ride tomorrow?

17:07.750 --> 17:11.166
I don't know if I've forgiven you
yet for hiding this morning.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.917
But, uh...

17:15.000 --> 17:19.083
You can always skip the bus tomorrow
morning and take your chances.

17:24.125 --> 17:26.291
Look, we're both men.

17:26.375 --> 17:28.792
One of us a little more
than the other, but that's okay.

17:28.875 --> 17:31.291
-What do you want?
-I'm not gonna do anything to mess up

17:31.375 --> 17:33.291
what you got with Carla.
That's not my game.

17:33.375 --> 17:36.000
I won't tell Carla how you feel
about her. It's not my place.

17:36.083 --> 17:39.709
But the minute
you screw this thing up,

17:39.792 --> 17:44.250
and you will screw it up,
I'll be waiting.

17:44.333 --> 17:47.417
Well, if you gotta wait,
I'd bring a book,

17:47.500 --> 17:49.458
'cause it's gonna be a while.

17:49.959 --> 17:51.500
-You goin' in?
-Oh, yeah. I'm right behind you.

17:51.583 --> 17:53.041
Cool.

17:59.834 --> 18:01.834
You remember, like, when the new
<i>Star Wars</i> movie came out,

18:01.917 --> 18:04.000
and it was all built up,
and then people went to see it,

18:04.083 --> 18:05.875
and it really wasn't
that great in bed?

18:06.458 --> 18:09.500
Relax.
The first one's a freebie,

18:09.583 --> 18:10.583
so you can get your form back.

18:35.625 --> 18:37.000
