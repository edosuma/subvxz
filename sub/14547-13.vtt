Some say your wedding day
is the most romantic day

00:03.712 --> 00:05.296
of your life.

00:09.759 --> 00:13.638
But others would argue, it's
the day after your wedding.

00:15.056 --> 00:16.933
Good morning,
Mrs. Lafrique.

00:16.975 --> 00:19.936
Good morning,
Mr. Mrs. Lafrique.

00:24.774 --> 00:27.277
Ugh! While it may be perfectly
legal for you two

00:27.318 --> 00:29.112
to consummate this marriage
as often as you like

00:29.154 --> 00:31.239
'I doubt it's gonna get you
to school on time.'

00:31.281 --> 00:34.242
Oh! Sorry, dear!
I'm behind on my hoovering!

00:34.284 --> 00:36.119
Oh! Are they consummating?

00:36.161 --> 00:37.871
- Yeah.
- Aww.

00:37.912 --> 00:42.042
Does "Consummating" mean
what I think it means?

00:42.083 --> 00:43.543
Are they [beep]?

00:43.585 --> 00:44.878
That's what I thought
it meant.

00:44.919 --> 00:47.130
Okay, out! All of you, out!

00:47.172 --> 00:49.215
- Okay.
- So sensitive.

00:49.257 --> 00:50.800
This is why people
don't have their weddings

00:50.842 --> 00:52.052

Hiya.

01:07.108 --> 01:08.151
(Tessa)
Lisa and Malik's wedding

01:08.193 --> 01:10.445
was notable for another reason.

01:10.487 --> 01:13.573
It was the first school night
in my whole entire life

01:13.615 --> 01:15.575
that dad didn't come home.

01:15.617 --> 01:18.745
You didn't actually think
that you were gonna sneak in

01:18.787 --> 01:21.664

did you?

01:21.706 --> 01:24.459
Okay. So, hello. Good morning.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.336
And, yes, you may have noticed
that I'm wearing

01:26.377 --> 01:28.963
last night's clothes,
but that's only because--

01:29.005 --> 01:31.382
I don't really need you
to paint the picture

01:31.424 --> 01:33.510
for me on this one,
George, but thanks.

01:33.551 --> 01:35.929
So, let me just say
that the assumption you made

01:35.970 --> 01:38.848
is correct,
and yes, although Dallas

01:38.890 --> 01:42.060
and I s-spent the night
visiting with one another--

01:42.102 --> 01:44.437
"Visiting?" Is that
what people your age call it?

01:44.479 --> 01:46.064
It doesn't mean anything,
we're not...

01:46.106 --> 01:47.774
I-it was a one-time thing, okay?

01:47.816 --> 01:50.235
We're all adults
and it was a totally harmless

01:50.276 --> 01:52.362
and unremarkable event.

01:52.403 --> 01:56.157
It was a huge mistake!
Our lives are ruined!

01:56.199 --> 01:58.868
Poor mommy.
I know how you feel.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.079
My mouth almost hooked up
with a piece of wedding cake

02:01.121 --> 02:03.373
but luckily, I pulled out
at the last minute.

02:03.414 --> 02:06.793
Dalia, why would I do
such a stupid thing?

02:06.835 --> 02:08.586
Because it was a wedding
and you were alone

02:08.628 --> 02:10.338
and Daddy Altman looks good
in a suit

02:10.380 --> 02:11.798
and the scent of Jasmine
was in the air

02:11.840 --> 02:13.091
and Jasmine makes you horny

02:13.133 --> 02:14.634
and "A Different World"
was a great show

02:14.676 --> 02:16.136
and whatever happened
to Jasmine guy

02:16.177 --> 02:18.555
and you and Daddy Altman
were meant to be.

02:18.596 --> 02:19.597
I will say...

02:19.639 --> 02:21.432
The sex was amazing.

That's what I'm talking about!

02:26.771 --> 02:29.774
Did you, uh,
do it animal style?

02:29.816 --> 02:32.360
What does that mean?

02:32.402 --> 02:36.239
I think
it's with sauteed onions?

02:36.281 --> 02:38.449
Okay. Then, no.
No, we didn't.

02:38.491 --> 02:40.577
But I will say,
I needed that.

02:40.618 --> 02:42.287
Dallas kinda rocked my world.

02:42.328 --> 02:43.663
And we both totally know
what it's like

02:43.705 --> 02:46.082
to get some good, good sex.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.335
It's just like, whoops!

02:49.377 --> 02:52.255
I totally just had awesome sex
all over the place.

You have children, so I know
you've been with a woman

02:57.218 --> 03:00.221
but I got to say,
it sounds like you haven't.

as a compliment.

Lisa was right. It seemed
like wherever I looked

03:41.804 --> 03:44.265
people had things
going on in their lives.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.809
Lisa and Malik had their
new marriage to share.

03:46.851 --> 03:49.062
George had a crazy
wedding hookup

03:49.103 --> 03:53.858
and my ex-boyfriend, Ryan,
had June.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.777
Watching them
dance at Lisa's wedding

03:55.818 --> 03:58.655
made that painfully obvious.

03:59.948 --> 04:03.159
But me, I was done with love

04:03.201 --> 04:07.121
and, for now, I just needed
a way to occupy myself.

Is this seat taken?

04:37.610 --> 04:39.570
- Dallas, what are you doing?
- What do you mean?

04:41.281 --> 04:43.783
Isn't this a little
inappropriate?

04:43.825 --> 04:45.743
How so?

It's a problem.
I don't know what to do.

It's really interfering
with my work.

05:16.983 --> 05:17.984
Is it?

05:18.026 --> 05:19.068
Well, maybe these designs

05:19.110 --> 05:21.154
are just ahead of their time.

I, for one, would love
a buttocks bonus room.

It's not even that I have
feelings for Dallas

05:26.659 --> 05:29.078
or I want to get back together,
but...

05:29.120 --> 05:31.706
It's just that night.
I can't get it out of my head.

She's really under
my skin, Fred.

05:34.876 --> 05:38.254

feel something

05:38.296 --> 05:40.173
I write a letter.

05:40.214 --> 05:42.216
- A letter, to who?
- To no one.

05:42.258 --> 05:45.303
In one glorious letter,
you get it all out.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.139
Nothing is too taboo or risque.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.058
And then, when the letter
is writ, you tuck it away

05:50.099 --> 05:52.435
somewhere safe,
and then you never read it

05:52.477 --> 05:57.440
or think about it or feel any
of those feelings ever again.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.692

- Three hundred and forty-six.

- I see.
- Yeah.

- He's my dad.

we decided

'that Malik should
handle our finances'

07:41.294 --> 07:43.880
and I should handle

- Not great.

special-order vegan entrees

07:50.720 --> 07:52.472

person's meal--

I am not a normal person!
I am an above-average person.

07:56.350 --> 07:59.228

Great. Y-you forgot
my grandmother's birthday.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.733
We just merged calendars today!

08:03.774 --> 08:04.901
Which happens
to be her birthday!

of these problems?

Let's hit the road.

08:27.423 --> 08:31.093
Oh, for you maybe,
but we're pretty tired

08:31.135 --> 08:34.472
and we need to get home
to take out our teeth and hair

08:34.514 --> 08:37.058
and eyeballs so we can relax.

08:37.099 --> 08:38.976
Okay, that's cool, but you guys
are coming back tomorrow, right?

Because I have
the whole day clear.

a little clingy

but my heart
was in the right place.

struggled to make sense

08:56.244 --> 08:57.870
of what he was feeling.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.336
Letter writing
didn't seem like the answer.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.091
But song writing did.

09:22.436 --> 09:27.358

George had a song and I had...

Oh, dear.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.908
- Hi, gals.
- 'Oh!'

09:35.950 --> 09:38.160
What the hell is this?

09:38.202 --> 09:40.621
I have been up all night.
Isn't it great?

09:40.663 --> 09:42.290
Your hand is bleeding.

09:42.331 --> 09:45.293
Oh, yeah. This happened
around 4:00 am.

09:45.334 --> 09:48.504
My eyes aren't as sharp
as my needles are.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.381
That's an old person's joke.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.758
A-and that's an eye-glass leash.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.136

to be staying in-inside

in a pork-pie hat.

and sell the others

Feel what again?

10:26.709 --> 10:28.961
- Love.
- Moisture.

10:29.003 --> 10:32.089
Anyhow, you've still got your
original hips and knees.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.467
You should be out there
using them.

10:34.508 --> 10:37.595
Yes. Why don't you go on a date
with Kay's grandson?

10:37.637 --> 10:39.388
- Oh!
- 'He's around your age.'

10:41.182 --> 10:44.518
I-if it's important to the
sisterhood, yeah, I'll do it.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.270
You're 30, right?

10:46.312 --> 10:49.774
- I'm 17.
- Oh, Esther has one your age.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.275
He's got freckles!

10:53.152 --> 10:55.071
(Tessa)
While the sisterhood
tried to force me back

10:55.112 --> 10:56.781
into the dating scene

10:56.822 --> 10:58.616
George was still
feeling the aftershocks

10:58.658 --> 11:00.951
of his one night stand.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.287
- Between whose thighs?
- Whoa. What?

11:03.329 --> 11:05.581
Whose thighs were you
singing about just now?

11:06.582 --> 11:08.167
- Was I singing?
- Yes.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.795
It was very sultry.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.213
Oh, well, that's weird

11:12.254 --> 11:14.006
because I-I didn't even realize
I was singing.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.758
Must have been something
I heard on the radio.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.385
Sing it again.
I'll Shazam it.

11:17.426 --> 11:19.970
I'm, actually, I'm, uh, I gotta
take care of some things.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.639
Uh, I-I want to Shazam it,
George. Let me Shazam it.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.516
Well, no, Sheila.
Why do you care?

11:23.557 --> 11:26.185
George, I like to stay
on top of what's current.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.816
(Tessa)
Monopoly time at the Shay's.

11:31.857 --> 11:34.735
I'm always the boot.
I have to be the boot.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.404
And that's how I
feel about the iron.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.864
And the newlyweds were finding
the games they played

11:38.906 --> 11:41.784
before marriage
were no longer fun.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.703
- The iron?
- The best piece on the board!

11:43.744 --> 11:45.746
The iron is... Oh, my God.
I feel like I don't know you.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.790
No one suspects the iron.
They discount it.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.542
And slowly, it irons
its way to victory.

11:49.583 --> 11:50.876
You sound like an idiot!

11:50.918 --> 11:52.044
Okay, what's going
on over there?

11:52.086 --> 11:53.462
Nothing!
Nothing.

11:53.504 --> 11:56.006
Just having
a little marital dispute

11:56.048 --> 11:57.842
over which game piece
is the best.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.260
- The iron.
- It is not the iron!

11:59.301 --> 12:01.804
So Malik plays the iron,
and Lisa's the boot.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.013
What's the problem?

12:06.726 --> 12:09.937
- We can do that?
- Mm-hmm.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.439
I just thought
since we were married--

12:11.480 --> 12:13.274
We had to share everything.

12:16.152 --> 12:19.280
Goodness, no! Being married,
you share less.

12:19.321 --> 12:22.533
When you're dating, it's all
sunshine and breastfast rooms.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.953
But when you're married,
you finally get to be

12:25.995 --> 12:28.038
who you really are,
which, in Malik's case--

12:28.080 --> 12:30.207
Is the worst piece
on the whole board.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.585
- Isn't that the thimble?
- Shut up, June.

12:33.377 --> 12:35.379
Victor!

12:35.421 --> 12:37.548
Sorry. I thought
we were all thinking it.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.008

'No, we were not
all thinking it.'

Fred and Sheila's
advice came just in time.

12:43.471 --> 12:47.391
As for George,
the cure for what ailed him

12:47.433 --> 12:50.102
came from a less
expected source.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.147
What's this?

12:53.189 --> 12:54.815
Sign up sheet for the open mic.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.192
Open mic?

12:56.233 --> 12:57.234
That is why you're here,
isn't it?

12:57.276 --> 12:58.402
I mean, you've been singing

12:58.444 --> 12:59.987

for the past 20 minutes.

13:00.029 --> 13:03.866
Uh-uh... Uh, yeah, of course.

That's, that's why I'm here.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.871
(Tessa)
While George prepared
to pour his heart out

13:08.913 --> 13:12.374
I tried to find space
in mine for Arthur.

13:12.416 --> 13:13.417
Well...

13:13.459 --> 13:14.752
Esther's grandson.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.295
That was fun.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.839
- Oh!
- Oh.

13:18.881 --> 13:22.551
I'm so sorry, Arthur.
You seem like a really nice boy.

13:22.593 --> 13:26.263
I'm just going through a really
heavy crafting period

13:26.305 --> 13:29.892
right now, and I don't
have romantic feelings

13:29.934 --> 13:32.978
for anyone.
Least of all, you.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.981
Well, I feel like you could have
mentioned that a little earlier

13:36.023 --> 13:39.527
before I wasted
my Saturday night and 50 bucks.

13:39.568 --> 13:43.739
- I ordered a side salad.
- You added chicken.

13:43.781 --> 13:46.283
(Tessa)
The truth was,
I was more of an old lady

13:46.325 --> 13:48.077
than those old ladies were.

13:48.118 --> 13:50.621
But, unlike them,
I was fine with it

13:50.663 --> 13:53.624
and I was home in time
to organize my yarn.

13:56.043 --> 13:58.546
Before I start, I'd just
like to thank the bartender

13:58.587 --> 14:00.005
for lending me his guitar.

14:00.047 --> 14:02.800
