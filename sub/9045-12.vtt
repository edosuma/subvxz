00:02.043 --> 00:03.504
<i>Previously on</i> Awkward.

00:03.629 --> 00:06.173
I got the heisman from Jenna.
Do you know who she's going with?

00:06.339 --> 00:08.300
- Why haven't you told him?
- I tried to but...

00:08.624 --> 00:10.219
Take care.
I'm not going to formal.

00:10.385 --> 00:12.680
I don't have a date,
and my nomination was a joke.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.558
As far as winter formal's concerned,
you won't be going.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.768
- We should go to dance together.
- I'm in.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.670
<i>Someone once said that it's choice</i>

00:21.795 --> 00:22.769
<i>not chance,</i>

00:22.894 --> 00:24.464
<i>that determines our destiny.</i>

00:24.971 --> 00:27.579
<i>My head made the choice
to end things with Matty</i>

00:27.704 --> 00:28.782
<i>but my heart,</i>

00:28.907 --> 00:31.490
<i>my heart was still waiting for
the chance that my head might...</i>

00:32.902 --> 00:33.742
<i>reconsider.</i>

00:36.195 --> 00:38.789
- What are you doing here?
- I need you to know something.

00:39.137 --> 00:40.332
Okay, I'm listening.

00:48.597 --> 00:49.842
I love you.

00:57.727 --> 00:59.459
I really love you.

01:00.130 --> 01:01.937
- What?
- It's okay. We can share.

01:02.603 --> 01:05.107
- You don't have to choose.
- Because we can all share.

01:07.354 --> 01:08.851
This isn't real.

01:09.122 --> 01:10.764
This isn't real.

01:11.125 --> 01:12.126
This isn't real.

01:12.526 --> 01:13.907
The ad does seem fake,

01:14.766 --> 01:16.952
and creepy.
"We can all share."

01:17.118 --> 01:18.492
Who wants that?

01:19.160 --> 01:21.485
- What are you reading?
- The missed connections in our area.

01:21.610 --> 01:24.101
I'm seeing if anyone was too shy
to ask me to the formal.

01:24.226 --> 01:26.378
But this site is
clearly only for pervs.

01:26.735 --> 01:29.767
God, can you imagine, bumping uglies
while others people watch?

01:29.892 --> 01:31.758
I can.
And it's disturbing.

01:31.924 --> 01:33.552
Are you excited for tonight?

01:33.718 --> 01:36.517
I can't believe you're going
to your first formal without me.

01:36.642 --> 01:38.749
I know.
It's not going to be the same.

01:38.874 --> 01:42.173
Wait, listen to this.
"I've blown it over and over again.

01:42.298 --> 01:45.443
"Give me one last chance, I'll sweep you
off your feet on the dancefloor

01:45.568 --> 01:47.104
"And finally be your guy".

01:47.229 --> 01:49.484
- Doesn't that sound like Ricky?
- Or Matty.

01:50.226 --> 01:51.737
Don't do this to yourself.

01:51.903 --> 01:54.068
If Matty had any gonads,
he'd fight for you.

01:54.193 --> 01:55.616
But he doesn't and he didn't.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.993
Do you think destiny
is determined by chance or choice?

01:58.159 --> 01:59.578
Chance, 100%.

01:59.744 --> 02:02.767
If destiny was by choice, I'd have
developed an ass, instead of a mustache.

02:02.892 --> 02:04.625
But I'm the one
who ended things with Matty.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.544
Maybe I misdirected faith
and missed my connection to be with him.

02:07.858 --> 02:09.445
Okay, you're getting really deep,

02:09.570 --> 02:13.225
and it's far too early for me to process
anything more than your morning breath,

02:13.350 --> 02:15.344
which by the way is rank.

02:17.674 --> 02:19.262
<i>Did I screw up my destiny,</i>

02:19.748 --> 02:21.661
<i>or was my fate supposed to stink?</i>

02:24.018 --> 02:25.604
<i>Suicide Club</i> presents:

02:25.729 --> 02:27.370
<i>1x12 - Fateful -</i>

02:28.049 --> 02:30.178
I'm thinking
I want to wear my hair...

02:30.457 --> 02:31.458
- Up.
- Down.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.686
Honey, your hair

02:33.811 --> 02:36.281
is the best weapon
in the fight against your heritage.

02:36.956 --> 02:39.451
Princesses don't have big ears.

02:39.893 --> 02:42.904
Jenna's been nominated
for sophmore winter princess.

02:43.029 --> 02:44.204
I'd like it up.

02:44.799 --> 02:47.776
With all that hair on top
you're just gonna look like a bobblehead.

02:48.065 --> 02:49.061
Good.

02:51.032 --> 02:53.541
Bad news.
I just got off the phone with Ming.

02:53.666 --> 02:55.133
- She's going tonight.
- Who she's with?

02:55.299 --> 02:57.135
She said it's a surprise.

02:57.301 --> 02:59.679
This sucks.
Now I'm gonna be alone losering.

02:59.845 --> 03:01.473
Why don't you come with me and Jake?

03:01.639 --> 03:03.767
- I'm not a date crasher.
- We're going as friends.

03:04.090 --> 03:06.728
I definitely add some sauce
to the mix.

03:12.859 --> 03:13.985
<i>I already know.</i>

03:14.151 --> 03:15.695
We can't wear the same color dress.

03:15.861 --> 03:16.696
Good call.

03:18.072 --> 03:21.034
Can Tamara come with us?
She doesn't have a date and...

03:21.733 --> 03:22.869
Sure.

03:23.212 --> 03:24.538
<i>I'll see you at 6.</i>

03:26.887 --> 03:27.784
Anyone here

03:27.909 --> 03:31.128
who can do something in the vein of
Grecian goddess meets Gaga?

03:32.002 --> 03:33.180
Let me drop for you.

03:34.088 --> 03:37.843
<i>With T. by my side, a good time
at the dance was all but in the cards.</i>

03:41.421 --> 03:43.056
Poker is not my game.

03:43.222 --> 03:45.183
Poke-her?
But I don't even know her.

03:48.307 --> 03:49.938
You guys are like Brainchilds.

03:50.104 --> 03:51.189
Dude,

03:51.355 --> 03:52.733
call her already.

03:54.636 --> 03:56.820
Does Mclight have a girlfriend?

03:56.986 --> 03:57.737
He did.

04:00.290 --> 04:02.492
You get your ass handed to you
or what?

04:02.658 --> 04:04.870
- It wasn't really my fault.
- It's never our fault.

04:04.995 --> 04:08.206
But you still got to own up to whatever
you think that she thinks that you did.

04:08.372 --> 04:10.436
She wants me to leave her alone.

04:11.042 --> 04:13.587
Dude are you a wuss?
I seriously want to punch you right now.

04:13.942 --> 04:15.213
She told me to take care.

04:16.935 --> 04:19.372
When she said it,
was she looking directly at you

04:19.963 --> 04:21.136
or was she like...

04:21.261 --> 04:22.546
looking at the ground,

04:23.058 --> 04:24.168
twirling her hair?

04:24.293 --> 04:26.684
The hair twirl?
Signature tell.

04:27.142 --> 04:28.268
It was pretty direct.

04:30.227 --> 04:33.148
Give her something she wants.

04:34.507 --> 04:36.318
She wants to go to the formal.

04:36.484 --> 04:38.575
- Take her.
- I can't, the formal is tonight.

04:38.700 --> 04:39.863
So make it happen.

04:40.029 --> 04:41.865
You're a McKibben,
McKibbens are winners.

04:44.656 --> 04:46.036
You're right, we are winners.

04:46.374 --> 04:48.314
Flush beats your straight.

04:51.029 --> 04:52.608
- What happened?
- Me!

04:52.733 --> 04:54.733
I can't go anywhere like this.

04:55.387 --> 04:56.630
Don't panic!

04:58.073 --> 04:59.549
We can fix your head.

04:59.715 --> 05:00.996
Yeah, but you can't fix my dress.

05:01.121 --> 05:02.511
You were right, it's awful.

05:02.677 --> 05:03.553
Happy?

05:04.299 --> 05:06.807
A little, but don't fret.
Come on.

05:10.136 --> 05:12.604
There's nothing in your closet
I'm gonna wanna wear.

05:13.421 --> 05:16.775
- What about this?
- You'd let me wearing this dress?

05:16.941 --> 05:19.945
Special times
call for special circumstances.

05:21.237 --> 05:22.197
Try it on.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.036
You know,

05:28.202 --> 05:29.333
that dress

05:29.458 --> 05:32.970
was specially made for Nana
when she was a model.

05:35.382 --> 05:36.914
I used to think if

05:37.683 --> 05:39.609
I could look as good as her in it,

05:39.734 --> 05:42.727
that she would love me
as much she loved that dress.

05:44.191 --> 05:45.768
- Isn't that silly?
- Yes.

05:45.893 --> 05:48.756
The only time she ever let me wear it
was to my prom.

05:49.385 --> 05:51.146
You should have seen me trying to

05:51.271 --> 05:54.643
fit my big ass pregnant belly
into that

05:55.121 --> 05:56.122
tiny...

05:59.220 --> 06:00.570
Do I look stupid?

06:01.618 --> 06:02.668
You look...

06:03.985 --> 06:04.986
perfect.

06:07.825 --> 06:09.375
I want you to know...

06:10.186 --> 06:12.122
that I would never love a dress
more than you.

06:13.497 --> 06:14.958
Unless it's vintage Chanel.

06:16.068 --> 06:17.168
Understandable.

06:20.140 --> 06:22.040
You are the best part of me.

06:23.537 --> 06:25.137
Because you're not me.

06:26.478 --> 06:27.554
You are better.

06:31.861 --> 06:33.476
I'm so sorry.

06:34.595 --> 06:35.596
Mom...

06:36.153 --> 06:37.315
I can't breathe.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.590
Gotta let go.

06:39.141 --> 06:40.568
I'm sorry, I was just...

06:41.094 --> 06:42.394
having a moment.

06:43.010 --> 06:44.899
I am entitled one on occasion

06:45.024 --> 06:47.158
considering you've ruined my figure.

06:52.410 --> 06:54.344
Do you think
you were meant to be with dad?

06:55.627 --> 06:58.043
If I wasn't here,
would you have chosen him?

06:59.642 --> 07:00.837
There was never choice.

07:08.289 --> 07:09.627
The girls are here.

07:10.583 --> 07:13.375
<i>If I wasn't going
to let fate influence my decisions,</i>

07:14.436 --> 07:16.936
<i>I wouldn't let
some vile letter do it either.</i>

07:18.715 --> 07:21.039
<i>It was time to put my past
where it belonged.</i>

07:22.686 --> 07:23.610
<i>In the past.</i>

07:29.824 --> 07:31.474
Ming's going with Vera.

07:31.932 --> 07:34.204
- Surprise!
- Hi.

07:35.696 --> 07:37.197
Give me a sidebar.

07:39.134 --> 07:40.835
Is there something you wanna tell me?

07:41.001 --> 07:44.354
'Cause I'm pretty sure
Vera is of the Ellen variety.

07:45.373 --> 07:47.622
Going with a girl friend

07:47.894 --> 07:50.455
was the only way
my parents would let me go.

07:50.580 --> 07:54.163
So, if I have to let her
fill me up at the end of the night,

07:54.288 --> 07:55.863
I'm done for the cause.

07:55.988 --> 07:57.602
Girls, get together.

08:05.864 --> 08:08.251
Chins out and down.

08:12.172 --> 08:14.411
Dad, I think your allergies
are acting up again.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.371
No, I'm crying.

08:18.451 --> 08:20.250
Damn you, 'cause now I'm crying.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.085
Can you believe we did this?

08:23.483 --> 08:25.214
We raised a beautiful girl.

08:26.938 --> 08:28.299
You're embarrassing Jenna.

08:28.465 --> 08:29.884
You're both embarrassing Jenna.

08:31.806 --> 08:33.336
It's your date!

08:35.014 --> 08:36.015
Thanks.

08:36.989 --> 08:38.606
Can I please speak to Jenna?

08:38.731 --> 08:39.842
You just missed her.

08:39.967 --> 08:41.938
She's on her way to the formal
with her friends.

08:44.709 --> 08:45.650
Thank you.

08:48.235 --> 08:49.113
You're good.

08:49.276 --> 08:51.927
You might wanna rethink
the lambskin rubber in your bag.

08:52.052 --> 08:53.465
They don't really work.

08:57.784 --> 08:59.334
I knew it, that little...

08:59.892 --> 09:01.659
You are "verboten" from this dance,

09:01.784 --> 09:04.754
"verboten" for looking so fabulous.

09:06.251 --> 09:07.757
Kitten, you need to relax.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.509
I know, it's just
Sadie always undercuts my authority,

09:10.672 --> 09:12.261
and I just know she's gonna crash.

09:13.318 --> 09:15.181
- Kitten?
- Too soon?

09:15.344 --> 09:17.889
Not at all, my velvet vindaloo.

09:20.528 --> 09:21.395
Go, go in.

09:24.040 --> 09:26.078
J, my girl, look at you!

09:27.005 --> 09:29.652
I didn't know Rosati was the guy
you've been telling me about.

09:29.777 --> 09:31.030
Jake's my date.

09:31.196 --> 09:33.240
Alright, you two lovebirds
have a good time.

09:33.824 --> 09:36.952
But watch the bump and grind.
We're trying to keep this shindig PG.

09:38.425 --> 09:39.538
Good.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.394
Principal Cox
wants to discuss the dress code.

09:42.519 --> 09:45.430
I know, some of these kids
are really pushing the boundaries.

09:45.806 --> 09:47.242
He was talking about you.

09:49.580 --> 09:51.550
- I wore this to my grandma's funeral.
- I know.

09:51.716 --> 09:52.927
Dork alert.

09:53.090 --> 09:54.854
We're here way too early.

09:54.979 --> 09:57.210
Ms Hamilton, allow me to educate you.

09:57.335 --> 09:58.872
It's all about arriving early.

09:58.997 --> 10:02.019
That way we get our pictures taken before
we ruin our hair out on the dancefloor.

10:02.521 --> 10:04.021
- You're gonna dance.
- Ladies,

10:04.187 --> 10:06.398
prepare yourselves,
I like to rip it up

10:06.925 --> 10:08.526
and it ain't pretty.

10:08.892 --> 10:11.570
<i>Unlike Matty,
Jake wasn't afraid to be a dork.</i>

10:12.059 --> 10:13.906
<i>And I was ready to dork out with him.</i>

10:21.791 --> 10:24.113
Do you think I can get one
just the two of us?

10:35.389 --> 10:36.742
I'll be right back.

10:39.045 --> 10:41.934
Don't yank me.
My dress is couture.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.865
I'm doing the best I can,
it's just...

10:43.990 --> 10:44.895
You're so...

10:45.061 --> 10:46.021
So what?

10:46.187 --> 10:47.064
Wiggly.

10:49.582 --> 10:50.192
Duck!

10:53.243 --> 10:54.363
It's been fun.

11:07.959 --> 11:08.876
Lip gloss?

11:11.767 --> 11:13.007
I noticed you're with Jake.

11:13.610 --> 11:14.863
We're just friends.

11:14.988 --> 11:17.261
I don't care.
We're not together anymore.

11:24.809 --> 11:26.061
You look really pretty.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.267
Thanks.

11:28.108 --> 11:29.064
So do you.

11:33.689 --> 11:35.204
What was that?

11:35.732 --> 11:37.248
You look really pretty.

11:37.373 --> 11:40.743
Help me in, so I can slap you.

11:43.874 --> 11:46.540
You're a bitch,
and it's your fault Jake dumped me.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.875
Break in yourself.

12:01.948 --> 12:03.418
<i>I was living in the moment</i>

12:03.543 --> 12:06.432
<i>and I didn't know
if it was by chance or by choice,</i>

12:06.557 --> 12:07.859
<i>but I didn't care.</i>

12:07.984 --> 12:10.184
<i>It was time for me to bust a move.</i>

12:26.118 --> 12:28.165
- I'm busy.
- Listen to me please.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.584
If you give me one more chance
I'll sweep you off your feet.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.712
On the dancefloor,
and finally be your guy.

12:33.878 --> 12:34.922
It's you.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.466
It's you.
It's always been you.

12:37.632 --> 12:38.884
I was just too blind to see it.

12:43.044 --> 12:44.353
Where did Tamara go?

12:48.059 --> 12:49.812
Ricky is the missed connection.

12:49.978 --> 12:52.940
- He's a what?
- It's a long story.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.206
Look, I only have 60 bucks.

12:55.331 --> 12:58.991
But I can promise you that helping me get in
is like the gift that we'll keep on giving.

13:00.151 --> 13:01.401
Like your acne.

13:03.113 --> 13:06.190
Lighten up, it was a joke.
I can double your money on monday.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.151
You're having a good time?

13:12.747 --> 13:14.879
- You?
- I always have a good time with you.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.216
<i>It was exactly what I was thinking.</i>

13:17.341 --> 13:19.091
<i>Everything with Jake was easy.</i>

13:19.257 --> 13:21.196
Everything with you is easy.

13:22.127 --> 13:24.430
Do you think things happen to us
by chance or by choice?

13:25.076 --> 13:26.390
- In what way?
- Fate.

13:27.100 --> 13:28.350
Do you believe in fate?

13:29.053 --> 13:29.894
I don't know.

13:30.375 --> 13:31.437
But...

13:31.603 --> 13:34.723
considering you're here
with me right now

13:36.428 --> 13:38.444
means the universe
is working in my favour.

13:39.367 --> 13:42.053
<i>Maybe the universe
was working in my favour, too.</i>

13:56.894 --> 13:59.095
<i>Everything was as it was meant to be.</i>

13:59.685 --> 14:02.673
<i>Because finally the other guy
I had been pining over</i>

14:02.798 --> 14:04.135
<i>was all but a distant...</i>

14:05.815 --> 14:06.951
<i>40 feet away.</i>

14:23.154 --> 14:24.990
I'm really stoked you made it.

14:25.156 --> 14:28.160
- Who did you come with?
- Nobody. There was a girl...

14:29.285 --> 14:30.496
but I messed it up.

14:31.529 --> 14:33.749
- What happened?
- You don't wanna know.

14:33.915 --> 14:35.173
I do.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.129
I was going to take this girl,

14:40.488 --> 14:41.507
this great girl

14:41.673 --> 14:44.009
and things got complicated,
and I was trying

14:44.319 --> 14:46.345
not to hurt someone else
but I ended up hurting her.

14:47.679 --> 14:49.890
I didn't think she was gonna come
so I went to her house.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.601
- You went to her house?
- Her dad said she was here.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.730
Well, where is she?

14:57.418 --> 14:58.941
- She's with another guy.
- Dude.

15:00.016 --> 15:02.278
That sucks.
You should steal her away.

15:03.720 --> 15:05.072
I think it's too late.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.992
What do you think, is it too late?

15:08.850 --> 15:10.161
<i>I was confused.</i>

15:10.523 --> 15:12.288
<i>I didn't know
if I should listen to my head</i>

15:13.486 --> 15:14.623
<i>or my heart.</i>

15:17.876 --> 15:19.420
<i>So I went with my hand.</i>

15:21.925 --> 15:23.048
I'm so sorry.

15:23.932 --> 15:26.282
I think you're right.
It's too late.

15:28.887 --> 15:31.056
Okay.
Check one, two.

15:33.345 --> 15:35.561
Time to announce this year's

15:35.727 --> 15:37.227
winter formal court.

15:39.613 --> 15:42.484
Let's get down to some business
on some...

15:43.735 --> 15:44.611
Dick.

15:45.670 --> 15:47.406
Dick Walters, take over.

15:51.161 --> 15:53.113
Put the cookie down, Ms Saxton.

15:53.442 --> 15:54.830
You are to leave immediately.

15:56.161 --> 15:57.041
Or what?

15:57.207 --> 15:59.168
Or I'll have you expelled.

15:59.334 --> 16:00.794
Really?
For what?

16:00.960 --> 16:03.547
You know what.
Stealing Jenna's file.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.633
The file isn't missing anymore,
is it?

16:05.799 --> 16:09.470
And I bet my Mercedes
that you've never reported it stolen.

16:10.399 --> 16:11.680
- I did not.
- Well then.

16:11.846 --> 16:14.144
I guess it's just your word against mine.

16:24.460 --> 16:26.160
Val, what are you doing?

16:27.792 --> 16:29.531
Mr Mischra, she just accosted me,

16:30.138 --> 16:31.992
and you witnessed it.

16:32.558 --> 16:34.694
I didn't witness anything.

16:35.691 --> 16:38.999
I will have you both fired.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.000
Go for it.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.880
I bet my Camry that your word
against ours won't get you very far.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.343
You've just been sucker-punched.

16:50.773 --> 16:52.287
This is actually mine.

16:55.643 --> 16:58.852
Now, for Sophomore Winter Court,

16:59.470 --> 17:00.562
envelopes, please.

17:02.105 --> 17:03.730
Got them, right here.
Knew that.

17:03.855 --> 17:04.942
Sophomore Princess

17:06.065 --> 17:07.109
is...

17:09.022 --> 17:10.239
Clark Stevenson.

17:17.547 --> 17:19.425
You're welcome, go girl.

17:20.513 --> 17:23.076
And Sophomore Prince

17:23.201 --> 17:24.288
is...

17:26.194 --> 17:27.714
Matty McKibben.

17:41.157 --> 17:43.257
<i>One door to my heart had closed.</i>

17:45.441 --> 17:47.461
<i>Which meant a new one could open.</i>

17:50.159 --> 17:52.992
I just wanna say,
I share this with you...

17:53.415 --> 17:54.842
Jenna Hamilton!

18:05.849 --> 18:07.676
Oh, come on, one more!

18:09.896 --> 18:12.139
- What?
- You really like to dance.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.437
We're gonna head up Josh's after party.
Guys wanna come?

18:18.598 --> 18:21.107
- Harrisson's parents have a waterbed.
- Ricky!

18:24.460 --> 18:25.861
It's up to you.

18:26.890 --> 18:28.197
I think we're gonna pass.

18:34.297 --> 18:35.541
Let's get our stuff.

18:44.174 --> 18:45.881
There's something stuck to your back.

18:46.667 --> 18:49.218
- Like dirty code?
- Like what?

18:49.379 --> 18:51.656
- Like...
- Like there's a note

18:51.781 --> 18:53.097
stuck to your back.

18:54.718 --> 18:57.476
My parents are over at my neighbor's,
which means

18:57.637 --> 19:00.474
they're getting hammered
and they're not coming home anytime soon.

19:02.854 --> 19:04.525
- Do you want to come in?
- Yes.

19:06.796 --> 19:09.446
- Actually, is it OK if you don't come in?
- Sure.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.575
It's not that I don't want you to,
I do.

19:12.736 --> 19:16.162
- But I want to take things slowly.
- There's no rush.

19:16.772 --> 19:18.284
I'm not going anywhere.

19:22.560 --> 19:23.377
What is it?

19:23.949 --> 19:27.311
Tonight's the first night
anyone's ever held my hand in public.

19:28.402 --> 19:29.758
Besides my parents.

19:30.653 --> 19:32.597
- Does that freak you out?
- No.

19:35.161 --> 19:37.298
It just makes me realize
what I've been missing.

19:48.216 --> 19:50.949
Look what you've done.
I've completely blanked on the alarm code.

19:51.074 --> 19:53.917
- I have to call my parents.
- Do you want me to stay?

19:57.133 --> 19:59.179
Don't be freaked out
if I call you when I get home.

19:59.304 --> 20:00.248
I won't.

20:00.373 --> 20:02.703
I'll only be freaked out
if you don't.

20:11.593 --> 20:14.919
Hey it's me, I'm home.
I can't remember the alarm code.

20:15.044 --> 20:18.552
Wait, the code's in the junk-drawer.
Never mind.

20:29.271 --> 20:30.970
<i>Someone once said that it is choice,</i>

20:31.095 --> 20:33.716
<i>not chance,
that determines our destiny.</i>

20:34.631 --> 20:36.360
<i>But it was hard for me to process</i>

20:36.485 --> 20:38.994
<i>who would ever choose
to find what I found.</i>

20:41.931 --> 20:43.332
<i>It was chance.</i>

20:46.261 --> 20:47.262
Mum?
