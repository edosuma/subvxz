WEBVTT

00:04.238 --> 00:07.075
[music playing]

00:15.516 --> 00:16.384
Yeah.

00:16.417 --> 00:17.385
Yeah.

00:17.418 --> 00:19.019
Well, he was awake
in the ambulance,

00:19.053 --> 00:21.455
and they kept checking
his blood pressure

00:21.489 --> 00:24.458
and giving him oxygen and
everything like that, you know.

00:24.492 --> 00:28.429
They thought maybe he
had a minor heart attack.

00:28.462 --> 00:29.930
They wouldn't say
anything more than that.

00:29.963 --> 00:31.832
I mean, is that bad?

00:31.865 --> 00:33.201
I mean, that's gotta be bad.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.368
No, that doesn't
mean anything.

00:34.402 --> 00:35.769
It's only been a
couple of minutes.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.505
Well, they told you he's
gonna be all right, right?

00:37.538 --> 00:39.140
I Mean, at least they
told you that much.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.241
No, they didn't
tell me anything.

00:42.510 --> 00:43.377
Yeah.

00:43.411 --> 00:44.545
It's weird.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.380
He's got, like, all
these new guys starting

00:46.414 --> 00:48.449
on that prison job next week.

00:48.482 --> 00:49.550
That's OK.

00:49.583 --> 00:50.951
Because they'll just
wait till he gets back.

00:50.984 --> 00:52.286
No, I mean, you
know, what if--

00:52.320 --> 00:53.587
The important thing
is that he's here

00:53.621 --> 00:54.922
and he's being taken
care of, and this

00:54.955 --> 00:56.090
is a really good hospital.

00:56.124 --> 00:57.258
Where's the baby?

00:57.291 --> 00:59.893
Mark and Becky took
Andy and Jerry back home,

00:59.927 --> 01:03.197
and I said that I would
call whenever we knew.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.432
I wish they'd
tell me something.

01:04.465 --> 01:06.634
What kind of hospital is this?

01:06.667 --> 01:09.503
Why don't-- can you guys
take a seat over there?

01:09.537 --> 01:11.472
And I'm going to go get
your mom something to drink.

01:11.505 --> 01:12.373
All right?

01:12.406 --> 01:13.641
I know that it's hard, Roseanne.

01:13.674 --> 01:16.710
We just-- we have to be
patient and be really positive.

01:16.744 --> 01:19.247
And I'm going to be here
with you the whole time.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.781
Do you want me take Dan's stuff?

01:20.814 --> 01:21.615
No.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.955
[theme music]

02:18.972 --> 02:22.142
Uh, shouldn't this
thing be dripping faster?

02:22.176 --> 02:25.346
No, that's how fast
it's supposed to drip.

02:25.379 --> 02:28.282
I'll check back in on
him in a couple of hours.

02:28.316 --> 02:30.618
We have to watch him closely
over the next 48 hours.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.519
Why?

02:31.552 --> 02:32.720
What could happen?

02:32.753 --> 02:34.655
Well, even though it
wasn't a massive coronary

02:34.688 --> 02:36.390
and he's stable right
now, there still

02:36.424 --> 02:37.691
could be some complications.

02:37.725 --> 02:38.659
It's too early to tell.

02:38.692 --> 02:39.493
Really?

02:42.162 --> 02:43.531
Dan.

02:43.564 --> 02:46.234
Now, you can talk to him for
a few minutes, but take it easy.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.067
I'll be back later.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.773
Hey, good-lookin'.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.475
What's going on?

02:54.508 --> 02:56.810
Well, Darlene got
pregnant, you know.

02:56.844 --> 03:00.281
And David been married her,
so we made out good there.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.816
And you know, we
were at the wedding,

03:02.850 --> 03:04.885
and then you had this little--

03:04.918 --> 03:07.288
minor, little, tiny heart
attack, blah, blah, blah, blah,

03:07.321 --> 03:08.188
blah.

03:08.222 --> 03:09.823
And here we are now.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.326
And anyway, you want to meet
the person that saved your life?

03:17.531 --> 03:19.700
DJ.

03:19.733 --> 03:20.768
It was amazing, Dan.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.536
Everybody was all
panicked, but DJ here--

03:22.570 --> 03:25.172
he just starts giving you CPR.

03:25.205 --> 03:29.343
We learned it on
a dummy at school.

03:29.377 --> 03:30.344
I couldn't believe it.

03:30.378 --> 03:31.612
First, when he throws
himself on you,

03:31.645 --> 03:33.481
I think he's going to, like,
go through your pockets

03:33.514 --> 03:35.783
or something.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.618
You really did that, son?

03:37.651 --> 03:41.054
Yeah, it's really great to
see your eyes open up again.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.923
I know for sure on
my 16th birthday,

03:42.956 --> 03:46.360
I'd get the car of my choice.

03:46.394 --> 03:48.696
I'm really proud of you.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.097
Thanks, son.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.465
Sure.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.534
Here, now, go tell everybody
out there that your dad's up

03:53.567 --> 03:56.670
and that he's doing good.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.306
A heart attack?

03:58.339 --> 04:00.674
Yeah, a minor heart attack.

04:00.708 --> 04:01.875
How minor could it be?

04:01.909 --> 04:04.412
I mean, look at all the
machines I'm hooked up to.

04:04.445 --> 04:09.182
If I was a car, this
would cost $800 or $900.

04:09.216 --> 04:11.285
Well, they said that
they only, you know,

04:11.319 --> 04:14.622
probably have to keep you
in the shop just overnight.

04:14.655 --> 04:17.291
And the good news is, they're
giving me a loaner husband.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.970
[tapping]

04:34.508 --> 04:35.676
He's going to be OK.

04:35.709 --> 04:39.480
He's sitting up already,
and he's in good spirits.

04:39.513 --> 04:42.316
It looks like everything
is going to be fine.

04:42.350 --> 04:43.651
But it's getting late.

04:43.684 --> 04:46.053
There's really nothing any
of you guys can do here, so--

04:46.086 --> 04:48.088
you know, unless one of
you wants to go and give

04:48.121 --> 04:49.189
a liver to the guy in 308--

04:51.959 --> 04:54.395
I really don't think
it's wise for this family

04:54.428 --> 04:55.729
to be giving away livers.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.104
Yeah.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.307
Well, I'm going to stay
here with him overnight.

05:07.341 --> 05:08.976
I mean, you know, he's
OK and everything.

05:09.009 --> 05:14.114
But well, the room's paid
for, so what the hell.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.116
Well, can we see him?

05:16.149 --> 05:17.250
No, you can see him later.

05:17.284 --> 05:18.486
He's sleeping now.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.888
Roseanne, whatever you
want us to do, we'll do it.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.222
We're here for you.

05:22.255 --> 05:24.324
You know, unless you want to
do something somewhere else.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.026
Then, we'll be there for you.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.429
So you know, here or there
is where we'll be if you

05:28.462 --> 05:30.764
want us to be there or here.

05:33.401 --> 05:34.635
Yeah.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.405
OK, well, that's good, because
we do have a lot to do.

05:37.438 --> 05:38.806
We do.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.742
Like, OK, Mark, you want to take
back all the tuxedos, you know.

05:41.775 --> 05:44.812
And put Dan's on the
bottom, because they

05:44.845 --> 05:46.947
had to cut it off of him.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.649
That's good
thinking, Mrs. Conner.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.017
Yeah.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.619
And while you're out, then, go
to the park there, you know,

05:51.652 --> 05:52.586
where we had the wedding.

05:52.620 --> 05:53.754
Because we left
all of that wedding

05:53.787 --> 05:55.288
food and garbage laying
around and everything.

05:55.322 --> 05:56.857
Go get that sign
that says, Conner

05:56.890 --> 05:59.860
wedding, and throw that away.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.529
I'll help you, Marc.

06:01.562 --> 06:02.863
And I'll drop by
the house and bring

06:02.896 --> 06:04.665
you back a change of clothes.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.967
Thanks.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.505
So you guys just ought
to go home and change.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.741
Go to the cafeteria, though,
and bring me back some coffee.

06:13.774 --> 06:16.477
OK, Mrs. Conner.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.845
Give Dad a kiss for me, OK?

06:24.618 --> 06:27.988
God, do you
believe all of this?

06:28.021 --> 06:28.956
Here, you sit down.

06:32.259 --> 06:33.060
It'll be all right.

06:36.864 --> 06:37.665
Dan's strong.

06:42.202 --> 06:43.236
Everything will be all right.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.511
I've been with him
since I was 16 years old.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.589
What are you still doing here?

07:01.622 --> 07:03.991
I sent everybody
home two hours ago.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.526
I didn't want to go home.

07:05.559 --> 07:09.196
What have you been
doing the whole time?

07:09.229 --> 07:11.298
Magazines, watching TV.

07:11.331 --> 07:13.000
"Highlights"?

07:13.033 --> 07:16.670
How are that Goofus
and Gallant doing?

07:16.704 --> 07:17.571
Same as always.

07:17.605 --> 07:18.972
Gallant's getting straight-A's.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.574
Yeah, and Goofus is
getting all the girls?

07:23.143 --> 07:24.444
Well, I'm going to
call somebody to come

07:24.478 --> 07:25.646
get you and take you home.

07:25.679 --> 07:27.748
I want to stay.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.049
Well, there's just
no reason to stay.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.384
I mean, everything is
totally OK and under control.

07:31.418 --> 07:32.520
And we're all really exhausted.

07:32.553 --> 07:33.353
No.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.194
Yeah.

07:41.228 --> 07:44.865
I keep forgetting
how grown-up you are.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.300
[nurse on intercom]

08:05.786 --> 08:07.387
Hi.

08:07.420 --> 08:11.191
DJ's wanting to sleep
over, so I'm gonna let him.

08:11.224 --> 08:12.092
Cool.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.261
Yeah.

08:14.294 --> 08:15.462
You want me to
call anybody else?

08:15.495 --> 08:17.097
You want me to
call your parents?

08:17.130 --> 08:20.400
Oh, no, don't call them.

08:20.433 --> 08:23.336
[sigh] How are the
other kids doing?

08:23.370 --> 08:26.373
Well, Becky's home
taking care of the baby,

08:26.406 --> 08:28.141
and David and
Darlene are around.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.176
They canceled their trip.

08:29.209 --> 08:31.645
Oh, man, they canceled it?

08:31.679 --> 08:34.948
Well, you know, they just
moved it to our basement.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.684
You know, they can do it later.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.418
This was supposed
to be Darlene's day.

08:38.451 --> 08:39.687
And now, all of a
sudden, everybody

08:39.720 --> 08:40.854
has to take care of me.

08:40.888 --> 08:41.755
Oh, come on.

08:41.789 --> 08:42.890
Real good, Dan.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.324
They didn't even get to
finish the reception.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.258
So?

08:45.292 --> 08:45.859
Nobody cares about
the reception.

08:45.893 --> 08:46.760
I do.

08:46.794 --> 08:47.795
Well, so what?

08:47.828 --> 08:48.796
The wedding's the
thing that matters,

08:48.829 --> 08:49.897
and we had the wedding.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.733
So can't you just stop
thinking about that

08:52.766 --> 08:55.468
and, like, just try to relax?

08:55.502 --> 09:00.207
I'm having a real hard
time not thinking about this.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.108
Yeah.

09:01.141 --> 09:01.942
Me, too.

09:12.319 --> 09:13.921
What are you doing, Darlene?

09:13.954 --> 09:16.223
Oh, Dad bought a
new garbage disposal

09:16.256 --> 09:18.158
before he went into the
hospital, so I'm installing it.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.228
You don't know how to do that.

09:21.261 --> 09:24.397
It's just a simple machine,
Becky, that eats up garbage.

09:24.431 --> 09:25.999
No more complicated
than your husband.

09:28.736 --> 09:29.837
That's Dad's job.

09:29.870 --> 09:30.871
Yeah.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.505
I just thought it'd
be a nice surprise

09:32.539 --> 09:34.041
for him for when he gets home.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.275
Well, it won't.

09:35.308 --> 09:36.744
We'll make him
feel like we think

09:36.777 --> 09:38.411
he can't do that kind
of stuff anymore,

09:38.445 --> 09:41.649
like we're treating him like
some invalid or something.

09:41.682 --> 09:42.549
Yeah.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.550
Maybe you're right.

09:46.319 --> 09:47.988
No, I'm right.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.023
Can you get me the
flashlight out of the drawer?

09:53.627 --> 09:56.997
Shine it right there.

09:57.030 --> 10:00.167
Oh, you haven't taken
out the old one yet.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.269
No, it's stuck.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.471
It doesn't want to come out.

10:04.504 --> 10:06.740
I guess this is the dream
house for a garbage disposal.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.946
It's weird seeing
Dad like that.

10:12.980 --> 10:17.885
He seems so frail.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.353
Yeah.

10:20.387 --> 10:23.156
God, I never thought
I'd see him like that.

10:23.190 --> 10:26.093
I never even conceived of
something like this happening.

10:26.126 --> 10:29.496
Yeah, you know, like, I'd
see those guys, those big guys,

10:29.529 --> 10:31.331
and they'd have
these huge chili dogs

10:31.364 --> 10:33.734
that they've been munching on.

10:33.767 --> 10:38.739
And I'd think, whoa, there's a
heart attack waiting to happen.

10:38.772 --> 10:45.078
God, Becky, I mean, maybe people
thought that when they saw Dad.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.848
I never did.

10:47.881 --> 10:50.650
Me neither.

10:50.684 --> 10:53.353
Maybe I should've.

10:53.386 --> 10:58.325
Well, I'm pretty sure chili
dogs are off-limits for the old

10:58.358 --> 10:59.693
man from here on out.

10:59.727 --> 11:00.961
Yeah.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.796
You know, which means Mom
can't eat hers in bed now.

11:02.830 --> 11:03.630
So--

11:07.100 --> 11:09.202
What if he died?

11:09.236 --> 11:10.603
He's not gonna die, Becky.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.339
He's gonna be fine.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.941
Well, maybe not this
time, but some day--

11:13.974 --> 11:17.010
What are you thinking?
Just shut up, Becky!

11:17.044 --> 11:17.945
Well, what?

11:17.978 --> 11:20.213
Don't you ever think about that?

11:20.247 --> 11:22.282
Don't you ever wonder what
it'd be like if Dad died?

11:28.188 --> 11:29.322
Mom.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.290
Mom will never die.

11:33.260 --> 11:39.833
It'd be weird coming here
without Dad being here.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.802
Hey, what do you
say we just let

11:41.835 --> 11:43.937
Dad do this when he gets home?

11:43.971 --> 11:44.772
Yeah.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.522
God, you've got to be bored
out of your skull, doll.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.891
No.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.293
No, they've got a lot of great
magazines lying around here.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.061
Listen to this.

12:08.095 --> 12:11.865
With the election a month
away, Bush leads Dukakis

12:11.899 --> 12:13.533
by 12 percentage points.

12:20.540 --> 12:23.710
Nixon's out of office?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.478
Huh.

12:25.512 --> 12:26.746
Honey, why don't
you go down and get

12:26.780 --> 12:28.381
yourself something to eat?
You've got to be starving.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.783
No, I'm fine.

12:29.817 --> 12:34.454
I've been taking hits off your
IV while you weren't looking.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.056
Next time, we'll get chocolate.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.659
Rosie, I'm fine.

12:39.692 --> 12:40.693
Go.

12:40.727 --> 12:41.694
Yeah.

12:41.728 --> 12:42.896
Well, I guess if I
hurry down there,

12:42.930 --> 12:47.434
I can beat the
post-dialysis rush.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.401
All right.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.736
You want me to get you anything?

12:49.769 --> 12:51.671
No, thanks, honey.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.740
You sure you don't want
a cigarette or something?

12:59.779 --> 13:02.816
Oh, man.

13:02.850 --> 13:03.716
All right.

13:03.750 --> 13:07.154
You got my attention.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.489
[deep breath]

13:11.024 --> 13:14.194
I got no more fight left in me.

13:14.227 --> 13:17.797
That's all I had was a fight.

13:17.831 --> 13:19.266
Listen, I don't mind
that you pegged me

13:19.299 --> 13:21.701
for one of these guys that
has to keep grinding it out,

13:21.734 --> 13:23.103
but you got me
feeling like I was

13:23.136 --> 13:25.005
shoveling coal in the Titanic.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.640
No matter how fast
I was shoveling,

13:27.674 --> 13:30.677
it just keeps going down.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.413
I've been shoveling
so hard that I

13:33.446 --> 13:35.315
haven't had time to
deal with the stuff I

13:35.348 --> 13:36.516
was going to fix later.

13:36.549 --> 13:39.219
You know?

13:39.252 --> 13:40.520
I'm gonna quit drinking later.

13:40.553 --> 13:43.190
I'm going to start
watching what I eat later.

13:43.223 --> 13:46.960
I wanna deal with my problems
with my mom and my old man

13:46.994 --> 13:48.195
later.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.562
So is this the big lesson?

13:49.596 --> 13:51.764
Huh?

13:51.798 --> 13:55.468
That later is now, or what?

13:55.502 --> 13:57.938
I'm not ready to leave yet.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.707
[deep breath]

14:00.740 --> 14:04.111
I will slow down.

14:04.144 --> 14:08.015
Just give me some more
time to work on stuff.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.282
You know?

14:09.316 --> 14:13.686
I know you're probably not
real big on making deals,

14:13.720 --> 14:17.590
but just give me a few
more trips around the sun,

14:17.624 --> 14:18.425
you know, to--

14:24.364 --> 14:27.734
I don't want to leave them.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.202
She can't make it without me.

14:34.407 --> 14:41.414
Just-- it's not like I'm
asking for money or the moon.

14:41.448 --> 14:42.649
It's not that much.

14:46.019 --> 14:46.819
Please.

14:52.825 --> 14:56.363
[sigh] So what is this,
some kind of huge cosmic

14:56.396 --> 14:58.031
joke thing that you got going?

14:58.065 --> 14:59.933
Every time anything goes
good, you have to, like,

14:59.967 --> 15:02.202
totally make it
all crash in on us?

15:02.235 --> 15:03.636
Why?

15:03.670 --> 15:05.605
What did we do to deserve that?

15:05.638 --> 15:08.942
Why at Darlene's wedding
does this have to happen?

15:08.976 --> 15:11.111
I depend on you, and
you totally let me down.

15:19.119 --> 15:26.526
Although I guess it was
you that was cooking up

15:26.559 --> 15:29.662
all that greasy meat and bacon,
bringing him all those beers,

15:29.696 --> 15:31.198
sitting there doing that
right along with him.

15:31.231 --> 15:34.367
I mean, it's obvious.

15:34.401 --> 15:35.402
I should've seen.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.303
The guy's in trouble.

15:36.336 --> 15:37.137
Why didn't I see that?

15:44.877 --> 15:49.382
So I guess you're not
the one that blew it.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.895
Roseanne, why
are you doing this?

16:02.929 --> 16:03.796
OK.

16:03.830 --> 16:04.697
Open.

16:04.731 --> 16:05.865
What is it?

16:05.898 --> 16:07.334
Breath spray or mace.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.205
I forget which.

16:12.239 --> 16:14.007
But anyway, you've
got to get all

16:14.041 --> 16:15.608
looking pretty
and smelling good,

16:15.642 --> 16:16.943
because I've got a
big surprise for you.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.578
Is my poker buddies coming by?

16:18.611 --> 16:22.215
No, better than
that-- people I like.

16:22.249 --> 16:25.218
OK, come on in, guys!

16:25.252 --> 16:26.719
Hello, there!

16:26.753 --> 16:28.188
Oh!

16:28.221 --> 16:29.789
What's all this?

16:29.822 --> 16:32.459
It's the wedding
reception you missed--

16:32.492 --> 16:34.994
a dramatization
like on that "911."

16:35.028 --> 16:35.962
[chuckle]

16:35.995 --> 16:37.030
Yeah, it'll be fun.

16:37.064 --> 16:38.065
OK.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.500
So let me totally
set the scene here.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.569
Here we are, at the wedding.

16:42.602 --> 16:46.005
And Darlene and David
have just kissed.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.574
OK.
Do it.

16:47.607 --> 16:48.575
Do it.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.110
Do it, do it, do it.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.844
Aw, everybody.

16:51.878 --> 16:53.913
Aww!

16:53.946 --> 16:55.115
Yeah.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.849
And now, we've left the
wedding, and we're walking

16:56.883 --> 16:59.252
into the reception area there.

16:59.286 --> 17:03.022
So that would be time for
Dad to give the toast.

17:03.056 --> 17:03.923
Oh.

17:03.956 --> 17:06.826
Honey, I don't wanna.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.228
No, come on.

17:08.261 --> 17:11.064
You had really nice things to
say, and I want you to say it.

17:11.098 --> 17:12.465
So toast away.

17:12.499 --> 17:13.766
All right.

17:13.800 --> 17:19.406
Darlene, you'll
always be my daughter.

17:19.439 --> 17:23.943
David, I'm glad that you're
officially my son-in-law now.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.945
And if there's
anything you ever need

17:25.978 --> 17:29.582
or want that I can provide--

17:29.616 --> 17:31.017
OK, that's enough of that.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.853
We want the wedding
reception here to stay fun.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.489
So okey-dokey, what's next?

17:36.523 --> 17:38.391
Then, they dance.

17:38.425 --> 17:40.927
OK, DJ, music.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.230
[orchestral music playing]

17:49.068 --> 17:50.837
- Dad?
- What?

17:50.870 --> 17:52.139
Thought you were
supposed to cut in.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.106
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:53.140 --> 17:53.940
My dear.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.347
Ready for a little
fancy footwork?

18:00.380 --> 18:01.848
Ready as I'll ever be.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.250
All right.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.318
Yeah!

18:05.352 --> 18:07.654
Ready to be dipped?

18:07.687 --> 18:08.655
[sound of bed reclining]

18:08.688 --> 18:11.491
[laughter]

18:15.027 --> 18:19.166
Thanks, Dad, you're
really light on your back.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.568
Yes, that was fun.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.403
That was a lot better
than the last time.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.804
So embarrassing!

18:24.837 --> 18:27.274
Remember, Barry what's-his-face
invited me to that big spring

18:27.307 --> 18:29.609
dance thing, and
Mom gussied me all

18:29.642 --> 18:31.944
up like a girl and
made me dance around

18:31.978 --> 18:33.613
the living room with you?

18:33.646 --> 18:34.814
Evans.

18:34.847 --> 18:35.715
What?

18:35.748 --> 18:36.616
Barry Evans.

18:36.649 --> 18:37.550
That was the kid's name.

18:37.584 --> 18:38.451
[laughter]

18:38.485 --> 18:39.352
My god.

18:39.386 --> 18:40.287
You remember that?

18:40.320 --> 18:41.488
Yeah.

18:41.521 --> 18:44.557
That was my little girl's
first big dance thing-y.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.159
Well, we never
danced, Mr. Conner,

18:46.193 --> 18:49.362
but there was that one time you
threw me up against the wall.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.267
- Sorry about that.
- No, no.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.802
When Darlene and I
started living together,

18:55.835 --> 18:57.370
we should've told you.

18:57.404 --> 19:01.007
I guess I was just afraid
you would, I don't know,

19:01.040 --> 19:03.643
throw me up against a wall.

19:03.676 --> 19:06.179
Like he did with my boyfriend.

19:06.213 --> 19:07.647
I'm sorry about that.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.881
Fisher had it coming.

19:08.915 --> 19:09.816
No kidding, Dan.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.185
You really saved me, you know?

19:12.219 --> 19:14.187
You're the only guy in my
life who ever stood up for me

19:14.221 --> 19:18.225
and looked out for me, and
without wanting thing back.

19:18.258 --> 19:22.395
So thanks, Dan.

19:22.429 --> 19:24.096
Hey, Dad, I got a great story.

19:24.130 --> 19:25.365
Remember that time
I saved your life?

19:25.398 --> 19:26.599
DJ, you're getting the car.

19:32.905 --> 19:35.775
So how are you holding up?

19:35.808 --> 19:38.578
I'm starting to
drag a little bit.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.580
OK, well--

19:40.613 --> 19:42.349
All right.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.850
We'll come see
you tomorrow, Dad.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.518
OK.
Yeah.

19:45.552 --> 19:46.419
Take care.

19:46.453 --> 19:47.254
Bye.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.392
So short but sweet.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.861
How did you like
that reception, huh?

19:54.894 --> 19:56.863
[soft laughter] A bit gaudy.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.032
OK.

20:00.066 --> 20:02.602
Well, I'll let you get
some rest now, too.

20:06.673 --> 20:07.640
Roseanne, I'm scared.

20:11.244 --> 20:12.111
Yeah.

20:12.144 --> 20:16.783
Well, I'm not, so we're cool.

20:16.816 --> 20:19.185
Listen, there's something
I've got to tell you,

20:19.218 --> 20:21.254
and it's really important.

20:21.288 --> 20:22.555
Yeah?

20:22.589 --> 20:32.064
Yeah, I just want to know
that I've never cheated on you.

20:32.098 --> 20:34.934
I've never even wanted
to cheat on you.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.969
I just wanted you to
know that just in case--

20:37.003 --> 20:39.339
Don't say that, because there
isn't any just-in-case, OK?

20:39.372 --> 20:40.172
OK.

20:43.376 --> 20:44.811
So I have something I
want to tell you, too.

20:51.217 --> 20:57.023
For the first time
in, like, 25 years,

20:57.056 --> 20:59.692
I felt, like, totally helpless.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.700
25 years is a
long time, kiddo.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.403
[music playing]
