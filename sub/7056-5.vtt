35:02.444 --> 35:04.162
Hey, where are you going?

35:04.213 --> 35:05.463
To get answers!

35:05.497 --> 35:06.965
Peter!

35:06.999 --> 35:09.083
Hey, Walter,
can I call you back?

35:09.117 --> 35:11.719
Peter!

35:11.754 --> 35:14.556
Peter?

35:42.201 --> 35:45.653
You can leave.
I'll take it from here.

35:49.959 --> 35:52.210
[Muffled grunts]

36:03.689 --> 36:06.007
[Frantic breathing]

36:10.779 --> 36:15.566
[Panting]

36:17.185 --> 36:18.786
Why didn't it work?

36:18.821 --> 36:22.356
You don't even know
what you don't know.

36:24.543 --> 36:27.128
Before going on
a journey of revenge,

36:27.162 --> 36:30.298
dig two graves.

36:30.332 --> 36:32.033
Your friend was correct.

36:32.051 --> 36:34.969
Emotions get in the way
of judgment.

36:35.004 --> 36:36.638
Emotions did not
get the better of me.

36:36.672 --> 36:39.307
I read your tells to help me
assemble the device.

36:39.341 --> 36:42.677
Your assertion regarding
the involuntary response

36:42.711 --> 36:44.378
of the body to physical threat
was interesting

36:44.396 --> 36:45.980
but highly antiquated.

36:46.015 --> 36:47.815
It does not apply to us.

36:47.850 --> 36:50.652
In truth, there was a fly
on the window.

36:50.686 --> 36:53.154
<i>As my cerebral cortex</i>
<i>registered it,</i>

36:53.188 --> 36:56.324
<i>there was a small irregularity</i>
<i>in my heartbeat,</i>

36:56.358 --> 36:59.894
<i>'causing a slight deregulation</i>
<i>of my oxygen to my brain</i>

36:59.912 --> 37:02.613
<i>which in turn affected</i>
<i>my oculomotor nerve.</i>

37:02.665 --> 37:07.118
<i>This oculomotor nerve is</i>
<i>what caused my pupil to dilate.</i>

37:07.169 --> 37:10.338
That's what you picked up on,

37:10.372 --> 37:13.091
my observation of a fly.

37:13.125 --> 37:16.260
But you ascribed meaning
to something that was not there.

37:16.295 --> 37:18.513
You saw what
you wanted to see.

37:18.547 --> 37:20.715
You believed what
you wanted to believe,

37:20.749 --> 37:22.750
because that's what
your emotions do.

37:22.768 --> 37:25.219
They ascribe meaning
to something that is not there.

37:25.253 --> 37:28.255
They fool your perception
as to what is real.

37:28.273 --> 37:30.424
No. You're wrong.

37:30.442 --> 37:32.760
A dog does not smile,

37:32.778 --> 37:36.030
no matter how many times
your kind might think it does.

37:36.065 --> 37:38.933
<i>You put together the device</i>
<i>because of your intuition</i>

37:38.951 --> 37:40.267
and your knowledge

37:40.285 --> 37:42.370
and your experience
as an engineer.

37:42.404 --> 37:44.405
You simply
needed confidence,

37:44.439 --> 37:45.907
<i>so, you made sure</i>

37:45.941 --> 37:49.276
<i>you saw what you needed</i>
<i>in my reactions.</i>

37:52.447 --> 37:55.166
You blame us for her death,

37:55.217 --> 37:56.784
but it is irrelevant.

37:56.802 --> 38:00.838
She was here,
now she is simply not here.

38:00.889 --> 38:02.289
[Grunts]

38:02.307 --> 38:04.726
Did you feel that?

38:04.760 --> 38:07.845
She is not simply gone.
She will be remembered!

38:07.896 --> 38:09.313
Unlike you.

38:09.348 --> 38:12.066
If I kill you right now,
no one will remember you.

38:12.101 --> 38:13.801
No one will miss you.

38:13.819 --> 38:15.853
Miss me?

38:15.904 --> 38:18.406
You are nothing but tech.

38:18.440 --> 38:19.807
I would be ten times
what you are

38:19.825 --> 38:23.828
if I had that tech
in my head.

38:27.950 --> 38:29.550
[Grunts]

39:03.118 --> 39:07.872
[Tape loads into VCR]

39:25.057 --> 39:28.025
You're wrong about emotions
not being real.

39:28.060 --> 39:32.897
My feelings for her
are very real.

39:37.903 --> 39:40.905
[Shuddering]

39:43.492 --> 39:46.160
Can you feel that?

39:46.195 --> 39:48.830
<i>The pain of a piece of you</i>
<i>being torn out?</i>

39:48.864 --> 39:51.782
That's the pain a father feels
when he loses a child.

39:51.834 --> 39:54.785
[Scalpel slicing]

39:54.837 --> 39:56.504
[Groans]

40:11.553 --> 40:15.273
<i>(Olivia on tape)</i>
<i>[Indistinct]</i>

40:15.307 --> 40:16.858
<i>(Peter on tape) Think you can do it</i>
<i>in one again?</i>

40:16.892 --> 40:19.360
<i>(Etta on tape)</i>
<i>I'm gonna do it again.</i>

40:19.394 --> 40:21.262
<i>(Peter)</i>
<i>Oh, my God! You're a pro!</i>

40:21.280 --> 40:22.530
[Applause]

40:22.564 --> 40:24.932
<i>You did it.</i>
<i>No way.</i>

40:24.950 --> 40:26.534
<i>(Peter)</i>
<i>Take that out.</i>

40:26.568 --> 40:28.736
<i>(Etta)</i>
<i>Take that out and take that.</i>

40:28.770 --> 40:32.290
[Olivia and Peter
talking indistinctly]

40:32.324 --> 40:34.942
Kiss mommy.

40:37.779 --> 40:40.831
[Laughs]
<i>Good, your highness?</i>

40:42.634 --> 40:44.135
<i>(Peter) Watch out,</i>
<i>I'm coming for your cake!</i>

40:44.169 --> 40:45.553
[Etta laughs]

40:45.587 --> 40:47.121
<i>(Peter)</i>
<i>If you're gonna open a present,</i>

40:47.139 --> 40:48.890
<i>which one would you like</i>
<i>to open first?</i>

40:48.924 --> 40:50.457
[Etta talking indistinctly]

41:22.291 --> 41:27.328
[Pained groaning]

[Heavy breaths]

[Grunting]

42:01.663 --> 42:07.752
[Phone ringing]

42:16.428 --> 42:17.428
Hi.

42:17.479 --> 42:20.431
Peter.

42:21.683 --> 42:23.684
[Sniffles]

42:23.718 --> 42:27.438
Peter, I want you
to come home.

42:30.192 --> 42:33.327
I don't wanna lose you.

42:33.362 --> 42:36.330
It's okay, Olivia.

42:36.365 --> 42:40.868
Etta would want us
to be together, you know?

42:40.902 --> 42:45.072
She would want us
to survive this.

42:48.910 --> 42:52.463
I just--I love you.

42:54.850 --> 42:58.752
I love you too.
