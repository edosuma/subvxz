Holy Toledo! lt's only 3:30.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.443
3:30? ls that right, sarge?

16:27.695 --> 16:29.570
That's right, soldier boy.

16:29.947 --> 16:33.491
You better get some sleep.
We got a lot of work to do tomorrow.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.912
MULDOON:
On your feet, soldier. On your feet.

16:40.207 --> 16:41.374
What kind of a--?

16:41.625 --> 16:43.751
You got 1 0 minutes to pack.

16:44.003 --> 16:48.381
Pack in 1 0 minutes? Takes me longer
than that to get my heart started.

16:48.632 --> 16:50.133
MULDOON:
What are you doing?

16:50.300 --> 16:51.426
I'm packing!

16:51.760 --> 16:56.681
You pack what Uncle Sam issued
and that's all. You got 9 minutes.

16:56.932 --> 17:00.018
-Why the countdown?
-You got 8.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.978
Eight?

17:02.146 --> 17:03.438
Where are we going?

17:03.689 --> 17:05.857
MULDOON:
You'll get the word.

18:00.370 --> 18:03.623
On the way out,
everybody grab his gear.

18:10.255 --> 18:12.465
MORGAN:
Welcome to Da Nang!

18:12.674 --> 18:14.550
-Hi, Mike.
-Good to see you, Frank.

18:14.718 --> 18:16.219
Me too!

18:16.678 --> 18:18.471
-Captain MacDaniel.
-How are you?

18:18.722 --> 18:20.807
-l got the Jeep right over here.
-Fine.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.684
Captain, will you see
the men get all their gear?

18:32.694 --> 18:34.821
Here we go. Hop in.

18:36.281 --> 18:39.367
-l've been on that plane for hours.
-Rather walk?

18:39.618 --> 18:42.370
-l sure would.
-Good, let's stretch our legs then.

18:42.621 --> 18:46.374
Reynolds, meet us at Colonel Cai's
office and watch that weapon.

18:46.625 --> 18:47.875
Yes, sir!

18:59.138 --> 19:01.347
I'm sure glad it's you relieving me.

19:01.598 --> 19:05.852
-Don't hurry me. l got 3 weeks.
-l know. That was a great idea.

19:06.103 --> 19:08.771
-How's your back?
-Coming along slow but sure.

19:09.022 --> 19:12.275
Be glad when I can move around
and burn off some of this.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.542
-This truck for us?
-Yes, sir.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.294
That's service.

19:31.962 --> 19:34.130
Okay, grab your gear.

19:43.390 --> 19:46.309
Arthur E. Fuller. l knew that guy.

19:46.602 --> 19:50.688
Named a field after him.
He won the Distinguished Service Cross.

19:50.939 --> 19:52.690
Posthumously.

19:53.775 --> 19:55.735
Better grab your gear.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.529
Yeah.

19:59.406 --> 20:02.992
I suppose you'll take
the long way back home.

20:03.285 --> 20:06.704
Go through Hong Kong, pick up
a little yardage, some screens.

20:06.955 --> 20:08.581
No, I don't think so.

20:08.832 --> 20:12.793
My wife said not to bring anything
she couldn't either cook or play with.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.796
-What's my opposite number like?
-His name's Colonel Cai.

20:16.089 --> 20:20.301
He's a good man. Resourceful,
intelligent and has a lot of initiative.

20:20.552 --> 20:23.429
KlRBY: Outstanding?
MORGAN: Outstanding.

20:29.937 --> 20:32.647
-Chung See Bado. Good to see you.
-Thank you, sir.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.523
Glad you're in the outfit.

20:37.319 --> 20:40.112
Smart looking honor guard.
I recognize most of them.

20:40.364 --> 20:43.324
-Even those you don't, know about you.
-How come?

20:43.617 --> 20:45.409
MORGAN:
They got the word.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.586
MORGAN:
Good afternoon.

20:55.837 --> 20:57.255
Good afternoon.

20:59.049 --> 21:00.591
Colonel Cai, Colonel Kirby.

21:00.842 --> 21:03.719
-l'm happy to make your acquaintance.
-Thank you.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.513
Sit down.

21:06.181 --> 21:09.767
I have heard much about you
from Colonel Morgan and others.

21:10.143 --> 21:14.689
If half of what I've heard is true,
I'm positive we'll work well together.

21:15.232 --> 21:19.777
We build many camps,
clobber many V.C. Affirmative?

21:20.112 --> 21:22.780
Affirmative.
I like the way you talk.

21:23.031 --> 21:24.907
Let me get to the point.

21:25.784 --> 21:29.203
We have two new camps.
Here and here.

21:29.579 --> 21:32.123
This one is all right.
Everything is STRAC...

21:32.374 --> 21:35.543
...a full complement of
Montagnards and Special Forces.

21:35.794 --> 21:36.877
And the other one?

21:37.129 --> 21:38.796
Camp A-1 07...

21:39.047 --> 21:42.091
...code name two-niner Savoy.

21:42.342 --> 21:45.845
This camp we build
in the heart of V.C. country.

21:46.096 --> 21:47.805
One day is nothing.

21:48.056 --> 21:51.767
Next day we are there.
Big surprise for V.C.

21:52.561 --> 21:56.105
Unfortunately, "A" camp 1 07
is only about half-finished.

21:56.356 --> 22:00.484
The Viet Cong hit it with mortar fire
3 or 4 times a week.

22:00.736 --> 22:05.281
The villagers tell us that the V.C. are
making a big buildup across the border.

22:05.532 --> 22:09.243
We're hoping that weather does not
keep us from having air support.

22:09.494 --> 22:11.954
Without it, Charlie can
overrun the camp.

22:12.331 --> 22:15.541
The "A" team's tour of duty
will be up in 1 0 days.

22:15.792 --> 22:20.504
That puts that camp between the rock
and the hard place until it's completed.

22:20.756 --> 22:23.591
I brought 2 "A" detachments with me.
I could...

22:23.842 --> 22:26.135
...leave one here to form
a Mike Force...

22:26.386 --> 22:28.763
...and take the other up
for replacements.

22:29.097 --> 22:31.057
I think it's a good idea.

22:31.308 --> 22:35.478
I have to pay my respects
to the general at 1 500.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.897
-Nice to have met you.
-Likewise.

22:38.148 --> 22:40.107
See you later, colonel.

22:50.535 --> 22:51.827
KlRBY:
Hey, Provo!

22:51.995 --> 22:54.538
-Sorry, l didn't see you.
-That's all right.

22:54.706 --> 22:57.500
-Everyone looks at pretty girls.
-l wasn't looking at them.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.919
I was thinking about that sign there.

23:00.170 --> 23:03.130
KlRBY:
"In Honor of William J. Wallace."

23:03.757 --> 23:06.926
I noticed the buildings
and streets around here...

23:07.177 --> 23:09.470
...got the names of heroes on them.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.263
Dead heroes.

23:11.515 --> 23:14.016
It kind of sets a man to thinking.

23:14.267 --> 23:15.893
That it does.

23:16.728 --> 23:19.480
-And I also think we better get moving.
-Yes, sir!

23:41.336 --> 23:42.461
You all right?

23:42.712 --> 23:45.131
I'm still thinking
about them nameplates.

23:45.382 --> 23:47.758
The ones about soldiers
killed in action.

23:48.009 --> 23:51.512
My worry is my name don't fit
any of our buildings or streets.

23:51.763 --> 23:54.890
You got a real worry there.
Must be tough...

23:55.142 --> 23:56.809
...having a problem like that.

23:57.060 --> 24:00.396
"Provo's Barracks," "Provo's
Commissary." You see what l mean?

24:00.647 --> 24:03.315
-No.
-lt just don't sing.

24:03.567 --> 24:06.777
If you think of something
that does sing, you let us know.

24:07.028 --> 24:08.821
We'd want you to have the best.

24:09.072 --> 24:11.866
Thank you, sir. l appreciate that.

24:36.224 --> 24:37.933
BECKWORTH:
Colonel?

24:42.564 --> 24:44.899
Colonel? Colonel?

24:46.568 --> 24:47.735
Remember me?

24:48.361 --> 24:50.237
-George--
-Beckworth.

24:50.822 --> 24:52.990
This is Colonel Morgan.

24:54.075 --> 24:56.827
I took your suggestion.
I came to see for myself.

24:56.995 --> 24:58.037
Good for you.

24:58.205 --> 25:00.998
They said at Group l could go,
but it'd be up to you.

25:01.583 --> 25:04.585
-What do you think, colonel?
-Pretty hairy operation.

25:04.836 --> 25:08.964
I don't think this area's ready
for writers. Hate to get one greased.

25:09.216 --> 25:11.926
-ls that the real reason?
-Come again?

25:12.177 --> 25:14.386
My paper believes
we shouldn't be in Vietnam.

25:14.638 --> 25:17.598
Afraid I'll see something
to substantiate that belief?

25:19.226 --> 25:20.768
Be my guest.

25:26.066 --> 25:27.942
-Frank.
-Good luck, Mike.

26:06.856 --> 26:11.527
With joyous memories,
we leave the mystical city of Da Nang!

26:11.945 --> 26:14.947
What gay adventure lies ahead!

26:15.115 --> 26:16.156
Brother...

26:16.324 --> 26:20.286
...this trip is going to make
LSD feel like aspirin.

26:20.537 --> 26:21.829
Mr. Beckworth...

26:22.080 --> 26:24.206
...you going to write about us?

26:24.457 --> 26:27.543
-That's right.
-What are you going to say?

26:28.587 --> 26:29.795
I don't know yet.

26:53.778 --> 26:55.654
Man, oh, man!

26:55.905 --> 26:59.617
Look at all those trees down there.
My dog could go crazy!

26:59.868 --> 27:04.330
We have "A" teams out along
the Cambodian and Laotian borders.

27:04.581 --> 27:08.417
They each built their own camp.
We're headed for one of those now...

27:08.668 --> 27:10.628
...Camp A-1 07.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.974
There's our destination.

28:52.063 --> 28:54.648
-Colonel. Good to see you again.
-Captain. Thanks.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.483
You know Lieutenant Sachs.

28:56.735 --> 29:01.196
-Captain MacDaniel, your replacement.
-That's good to hear.

29:01.448 --> 29:05.451
Sergeant Kenny, pick up
the extra gear and the mail.

29:05.702 --> 29:08.746
If you gentlemen will follow me,
we'll get inside.

29:35.774 --> 29:40.611
KlRBY: You got about a 1 50-foot
killing area here, captain.

29:41.237 --> 29:46.074
The first thing l'd do would be
to cut that back another 300 feet.

29:46.326 --> 29:49.828
We've been wanting to do that,
but we've been short of help.

29:50.079 --> 29:54.625
We tried to get some engineers. They're
all busy. But I requested some Seabees.

29:54.876 --> 29:59.588
If that detachment ever gets here,
you put them on that first thing.

30:02.383 --> 30:04.468
KENNY:
Mail call!

30:08.598 --> 30:11.099
-Dodge City?
-Yeah.

30:11.267 --> 30:13.435
You can buy it cheap.

30:26.741 --> 30:28.659
Those what they call Punji sticks?

30:28.910 --> 30:31.745
SERGEANT: Yes, it's a little trick
we learned from Charlie.

30:32.747 --> 30:35.916
But we don't dip them
in the same stuff he does.

30:44.968 --> 30:49.596
You'd increase the effectiveness
of that concertina with more tanglefoot.

30:52.225 --> 30:54.101
-Got any more of them?
-Yes, sir.

30:54.269 --> 30:57.563
-Double the number.
-We'll get right on it.

31:03.528 --> 31:04.736
KlRBY:
Bring us up to date.

31:04.988 --> 31:09.616
They mortared us again last night.
It's becoming a fairly regular thing.

31:09.868 --> 31:13.912
-How many operations are out?
-Three recon and 2 ambush.

31:14.163 --> 31:18.709
-And that counterpart of yours--
-Captain Nim. He's out with a patrol.

31:18.960 --> 31:23.255
The one that just got zapped.
He'll be in tomorrow with 3 wounded.

31:23.506 --> 31:26.758
-Will you be staying awhile?
-l'll be in camp, off and on.

31:27.010 --> 31:30.721
We fixed a place for you in the commo
bunker. Not much, but it's dry.

31:30.972 --> 31:32.347
Good.

31:33.266 --> 31:35.601
After mail call,
I've assigned my men...

31:35.852 --> 31:38.520
...to get Captain MacDaniel's team
bedded down.

31:40.023 --> 31:41.356
It's a newspaperman.

31:44.235 --> 31:48.822
This is Captain Coleman. Mr. Beckworth
is with the Chronicle-Herald.

31:49.073 --> 31:51.241
-Can you find a spot for him?
-Affirmative.

31:51.492 --> 31:52.534
Sergeant Kenny.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.954
Take Mr. Beckworth here to my hooch.
Get him squared away.

31:56.205 --> 31:57.414
Thank you.

31:58.499 --> 32:00.042
This way, Mr. Beckworth.

32:00.293 --> 32:01.710
Can l give you a hand?

32:07.842 --> 32:10.385
If it's all right,
we'll stay with the team.

32:10.553 --> 32:11.762
Fine.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.104
This way, sir.

32:25.818 --> 32:30.322
The captain has the bottom bunk. We'll
get somebody to make this one for you.

32:30.990 --> 32:33.909
-ls there drinking water?
-l don't know if it's cold.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.953
It'll be fine, thank you.

32:46.965 --> 32:51.510
HOBSON: You've got a pad in the storage
bunker. You can have mine in a few days.

32:51.761 --> 32:53.887
I hope. To the right here.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.266
You funny!

33:00.228 --> 33:02.062
You've made Hamchunk's "A" Club.

33:04.065 --> 33:05.649
You funny!

33:06.859 --> 33:08.360
You not.

33:10.571 --> 33:12.864
This is Hamchunk.

33:16.452 --> 33:19.663
He's become a permanent fixture here.
He's an orphan.

33:20.665 --> 33:23.959
Lived with some missionaries
about 1 0 clicks south of here...

33:24.210 --> 33:28.046
...till they were assassinated.
Maybe you could use an interpreter.

33:28.297 --> 33:31.550
-Missionaries taught him English.
-l don't want an interpreter.

33:31.801 --> 33:33.844
You number one. l choose you.

33:34.637 --> 33:36.847
I don't want to be chosen.

33:37.306 --> 33:41.268
-l don't think you have much choice.
-Choice, Mr. Hobson?

33:41.519 --> 33:45.188
I haven't had a choice
since I was selected for this...

33:45.606 --> 33:46.648
...outfit.

33:46.816 --> 33:48.483
You get used to me.

33:48.776 --> 33:50.444
You funny.

33:50.778 --> 33:52.988
-You--
-ln here.

34:03.291 --> 34:05.792
What's the status
of your crew-served weapons?

34:06.044 --> 34:09.295
We have two 81 s, four 60s...

34:09.547 --> 34:12.924
...twelve .30 calibers,
three on each wall.

34:13.176 --> 34:17.679
One 4-deuce. Besides crew-served,
we have six M-79's.

34:17.929 --> 34:19.681
No .50 calibers?

34:19.931 --> 34:23.560
I'd give an R and R in Bangkok
for the smell of a .50.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.645
KlRBY: You hear that, sergeant?
-Yes, sir.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.813
-Know where there are any .50's?
MULDOON: No, sir.

34:27.982 --> 34:32.027
Neither do I.
You better tell Sergeant Petersen.

34:32.277 --> 34:35.655
I almost forgot. Captain MacDaniel
needs corrugated tin.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.366
-lt's been hard to come by lately.
-Sergeant.

34:38.659 --> 34:43.413
Yes, sir. I know.
"Tell Petersen. Tell the scrounger."

34:44.290 --> 34:45.748
Petersen!

34:47.793 --> 34:51.670
What happens if Charlie hits this camp
before you get it completed?

34:52.297 --> 34:56.301
If he does, and he's too strong
for us to handle...

34:56.552 --> 35:01.306
...we have 3 LZs within 4 clicks to
send 1 0 choppers each to reinforce us.

35:02.058 --> 35:05.644
One is by that shale cliff
you saw on your way in.

35:05.895 --> 35:08.688
And the second is to the west of here...

35:08.940 --> 35:12.901
...near a deserted Montagnard village
where some of these people used to live.

35:13.152 --> 35:17.322
The third is to the north,
near an old bridge.

35:18.199 --> 35:20.158
What if Charlie overruns the camp?

35:21.494 --> 35:22.994
In that case, sir...

35:23.246 --> 35:26.289
...the camp is prepared
to escape and evade on order...

35:26.541 --> 35:29.000
...through places
in the wire and mines...

35:29.252 --> 35:31.753
...only "A" Team
and Captain Nim know about.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.548
-My compliments.
-Thank you, sir.

35:38.136 --> 35:41.680
Commander of this area
runs everything by the book.

35:41.931 --> 35:44.391
And l am with him to the nth degree.

35:44.642 --> 35:48.270
And every piece of this equipment
will be painted.

35:48.563 --> 35:52.357
And every piece of this equipment
will be numbered.

35:52.650 --> 35:54.067
And every--

35:57.822 --> 35:59.906
What in the hell is that?

36:21.721 --> 36:24.431
BECKWORTH: You make good coffee.
-Cholong coffee.

36:28.352 --> 36:30.979
AMA: More coffee, sergeant?
MULDOON: No, thanks.

36:32.523 --> 36:33.732
GRlFFIN:
Brother!

36:34.859 --> 36:37.360
Boy, is it miserable out there!

36:37.612 --> 36:42.199
And believe me, it's sure in hell
stay-awake weather.

36:42.533 --> 36:44.367
Don't you men have rain gear?

36:44.869 --> 36:48.371
Yeah, but it doesn't
do any good in this lousy climate.

37:02.887 --> 37:06.973
COLLlER:
Skipper! Savoy 3 is on the horn, sir.

37:10.019 --> 37:12.103
Savoy 3 to Savoy 6.

37:12.355 --> 37:14.606
NIM [OVER RADlO]:
This is Savoy 3.

37:14.857 --> 37:17.442
I'm nearing home base.
I've thrown smoke.

37:17.693 --> 37:19.444
can you identify?

37:19.695 --> 37:21.488
COLEMAN:
I see the red smoke.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.823
Come on in.

37:24.116 --> 37:25.283
Out.

37:30.289 --> 37:31.957
COLEMAN:
Give them a hand.

37:33.167 --> 37:35.835
-Morning, Max, Collier.
-Morning, sir.

37:36.379 --> 37:39.923
-Hell of a mess!
-Looks like we'll float away.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.467
What's this outfit coming in?

37:42.969 --> 37:45.637
COLEMAN: That's Captain Nim,
your counterpart...

37:46.180 --> 37:48.765
...with a patrol that just got zapped.

37:49.225 --> 37:50.684
-Joe.
-Yes, sir.

37:50.893 --> 37:54.771
Alert the dispensary.
Tell them casualties are coming in.

37:55.564 --> 37:58.066
I'll go find Colonel Kirby.

38:32.101 --> 38:33.768
It was a close one.

38:34.520 --> 38:38.440
LlEUTENANT: Get those casualties over
to the dispensary. Let's go. Snap it up!

38:39.900 --> 38:40.942
The rest of you...

38:41.360 --> 38:45.905
...get some dry clothes and chow.
Report for debriefing.

38:47.074 --> 38:48.283
Move it out!

38:48.534 --> 38:49.951
Fill me in.

38:50.202 --> 38:52.620
As you know,
we were hit yesterday.

38:52.872 --> 38:54.539
Three casualties.

38:54.832 --> 38:57.417
This is sure Charlie's weather!

38:57.793 --> 38:59.794
But they didn't follow us.

39:00.046 --> 39:02.255
-You sure?
-Affirmative.

39:04.258 --> 39:08.053
Skipper, l would like
to look after my casualties.

39:08.304 --> 39:10.513
Sure. Come on.

39:25.571 --> 39:27.947
KlRBY: What's the situation?
COLEMAN: He's all right.

39:28.115 --> 39:29.991
MEDIC:
More painful than serious, sir.

39:30.159 --> 39:33.912
Colonel, l want you to meet
the camp commander.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.122
-Oh!
-Dai Uy Nim.

39:36.290 --> 39:38.291
KlRBY:
Stay where you are, Dai Uy.

39:38.584 --> 39:39.709
Tran Nim.

39:39.960 --> 39:43.046
I've read your name on many reports.
You're very active.

39:43.339 --> 39:45.256
We try, sir.

39:45.674 --> 39:48.510
Meet your new
counterpart, Captain MacDaniel.

39:48.969 --> 39:52.597
Welcome. We will have a good post
here when it is finished.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.307
MacDANlEL:
I've no doubt, Dai Uy.

39:54.725 --> 39:56.601
Your outfit looks pretty beat up.

39:57.812 --> 40:01.856
-Eleven days is a long patrol.
-We're short of men.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.735
We've got everything we need
except strikers.

40:06.153 --> 40:07.779
What seems to be the trouble?

40:08.030 --> 40:13.076
The natives have been so exploited,
they won't trust anyone with a gun.

40:13.369 --> 40:17.497
Same old story. How many villages
are there in the vicinity?

40:17.748 --> 40:20.875
We've got 7.
There were 5.

40:21.127 --> 40:23.002
And we've got 2 in camp.

40:23.796 --> 40:27.132
If you got all the villagers in,
what would that do for you?

40:27.383 --> 40:29.634
That'd give us 300-500.

40:29.927 --> 40:32.220
Better get on the Psy War about this.

40:32.471 --> 40:33.721
NIM:
When you leave, Dai Uy?

40:33.973 --> 40:36.433
Tomorrow. Hopefully.

40:36.892 --> 40:39.894
Da Nang, Nha Trang,
Saigon and home!

40:41.689 --> 40:44.023
My home is in Hanoi.

40:44.733 --> 40:46.192
I go home too someday.

40:46.735 --> 40:48.111
You see.

40:49.196 --> 40:52.740
First, kill all stinking Cong.

40:53.701 --> 40:55.034
Then go home.

40:58.956 --> 41:00.498
Will there be anything else?

41:01.792 --> 41:03.084
That's all, Nim.

41:03.335 --> 41:04.669
NIM:
Thank you, sir.

41:09.049 --> 41:11.092
He sounds like he means it.

41:11.343 --> 41:14.512
He keeps score
on the wall of his hooch.

41:14.889 --> 41:17.765
He personally greased 52 this year.

41:18.017 --> 41:19.350
Says he'll double it...

41:19.643 --> 41:23.646
...if all the 'Yards will get out of his
way and give him a clear field of fire.

41:25.399 --> 41:29.777
I noticed a load of corrugated tin's
miraculously appeared overnight.

41:30.070 --> 41:32.071
Sergeant Petersen provided it.

41:32.364 --> 41:34.032
A good man you got there.

41:34.283 --> 41:36.326
Sergeant Petersen say where he got it?

41:36.577 --> 41:39.037
He said the good fairy left it.

41:39.288 --> 41:42.916
I hope he said,
"The good fairy left it, sir!"

41:43.209 --> 41:46.044
Captain, will you join us
in the commo bunker?

41:54.512 --> 41:57.680
MacDANlEL: Good evening, colonel.
KlRBY: Relax. Sit down.

42:00.476 --> 42:03.186
-My, it's a beautiful evening.
MacDANlEL: That it is.

42:03.437 --> 42:04.687
MULDOON:
Captain Nim.

42:05.356 --> 42:06.606
NIM:
Thank you.

42:10.110 --> 42:12.445
This would be great country...

42:13.489 --> 42:14.906
...if it weren't for the war.

42:15.366 --> 42:17.283
And the damn monsoons.

42:31.465 --> 42:33.341
Give me a beer, Petersen.

42:33.592 --> 42:35.593
You won it all.

42:38.722 --> 42:40.598
PARKS: Mr. Petersen?
-Yeah.

42:40.808 --> 42:42.559
Why ain't you in this game?

42:42.851 --> 42:45.770
Mr. Beckworth showed him 3 aces.

42:51.443 --> 42:55.196
Be sure and check the guard roster
before you turn in.

42:55.406 --> 42:56.698
MEN:
Yes, sir.

42:57.283 --> 42:59.325
-Good night.
MEN: Good night, sir.

43:05.249 --> 43:06.457
Where's McGee?

43:08.752 --> 43:10.712
Doc, you got the 4-to-6 watch.

43:11.005 --> 43:12.964
Delightful. Thank you.

43:13.716 --> 43:16.217
Jim Beam!
You're not feeding him that stuff?

43:16.468 --> 43:18.011
You sure it's good for him?

43:18.262 --> 43:20.096
You questioning...

43:20.723 --> 43:22.932
...my professional competence?

43:23.350 --> 43:24.976
He sure looks bad.

43:25.227 --> 43:26.978
He's dying, poor old thing.

43:27.229 --> 43:30.148
-Can't even eat anymore.
-What seems to be wrong?

43:30.399 --> 43:34.694
I'm not the best doctor in the world,
but I'm the best one without a license.

43:34.945 --> 43:39.198
My diagnosis is plague,
tuberculosis, old age...

43:39.450 --> 43:40.867
...and no hope.

43:41.118 --> 43:42.744
He's tired.

43:42.995 --> 43:44.579
Bone tired.

44:00.721 --> 44:02.388
SOLDlER:
The captain's in there!

44:08.270 --> 44:10.229
Check the damage in the dispensary!

44:10.648 --> 44:14.692
Everything's all right here, colonel!
A near miss, but nobody hurt.

44:17.029 --> 44:19.656
-l think they've stopped.
-Yes, sir.

44:20.366 --> 44:21.991
This is the usual procedure.

44:22.242 --> 44:25.203
About every other night.
Harassment.

44:26.997 --> 44:28.748
It's pretty good shooting.

44:28.999 --> 44:32.669
Commo bunker,
the dispensary, the team house.

44:32.920 --> 44:36.089
It's a sure thing that they
have eyes inside our camp.

44:39.593 --> 44:41.719
MacDANlEL: Check your gear.
Commo bunker was hit.

44:41.970 --> 44:45.431
Lieutenant Green,
form a recon patrol, ASAP!

44:45.683 --> 44:47.350
GREEN:
Petersen, come with me.

44:48.227 --> 44:49.268
MacDANlEL:
Who is it?

44:49.436 --> 44:51.187
It's the captain, sir.

44:51.897 --> 44:53.564
Better...

44:53.774 --> 44:55.108
...move him out of there.

44:57.611 --> 44:58.778
Colonel Kirby!

44:58.946 --> 45:01.739
KlRBY:
Yo! Be right there.

45:24.888 --> 45:28.224
He was going to go home
tomorrow, wasn't he, sir?

45:31.186 --> 45:32.895
All the way.

45:53.834 --> 45:57.336
PlLOT: What do we got, 1 0 pounders?
GREEN: 1 0-pound warheads, sir.

46:00.591 --> 46:03.426
MULDOON: Ready to go hunting?
PlLOT: Be a couple of minutes yet.

46:08.098 --> 46:10.975
We'll be gone about 3 hours.
Mind the store.

46:11.351 --> 46:12.393
Don't worry.

46:12.561 --> 46:15.146
SAVOY 8 [OVER RADIO]:
Two-niner Savoy.

46:15.314 --> 46:17.565
This is Savoy 8. Over.

46:17.983 --> 46:20.777
Savoy 8, this is Savoy 5. Over.

46:21.028 --> 46:23.279
This is Savoy 8. I'm nearing the camp.

46:23.530 --> 46:26.866
Have thrown smoke. Identify.

46:27.117 --> 46:28.743
Savoy 8, this is Savoy 5.

46:29.286 --> 46:30.912
I see green smoke.

46:31.163 --> 46:32.830
Come on in. Out.

46:34.833 --> 46:36.918
We better get out of the way.

46:55.437 --> 46:58.147
Those choppers are very important
out here, aren't they?

46:58.398 --> 47:00.775
Couldn't win this war without them.

47:04.238 --> 47:05.363
Captain.

47:06.073 --> 47:10.076
I'm sort of new out here.
What's this all about?

47:12.120 --> 47:14.664
Muldoon and MacDaniel,
in those choppers...

47:14.915 --> 47:19.418
...fly low over the treetops
and hope to draw V.C. gunfire.

47:25.217 --> 47:27.885
You mean there are V.C. that close?

47:29.221 --> 47:30.304
Yes.

47:30.556 --> 47:34.559
Mr. Beckworth, I have V.C.
in my own strike force.

47:34.935 --> 47:38.437
Pardon me.
I have to check the perimeter.

48:03.589 --> 48:06.632
There they are,
building a boat bridge.

48:06.925 --> 48:09.468
MacDANlEL: They're not Cong,
they're hard-core regulars.

49:30.050 --> 49:31.092
Petersen...

49:32.594 --> 49:33.678
...you worry me.

49:34.596 --> 49:37.348
Three tours of duty and you're
still acting like a civilian.

49:38.350 --> 49:40.851
Sergeant Muldoon, l'm not a Marine.

49:41.103 --> 49:43.145
I believe in my comfort.

49:45.273 --> 49:47.858
We got the tin.

49:48.276 --> 49:49.777
What about the .50 caliber?

49:50.153 --> 49:52.113
Don't worry. Next drop.

49:52.948 --> 49:53.990
How'd you do it?

49:54.199 --> 49:56.575
A guy in Khe Sahn
wanted 2 cases of bourbon.

49:56.827 --> 49:59.620
Bourbon! How'd you get
2 cases of bourbon?

49:59.871 --> 50:01.789
From a straight leg
in supply in Bien Hoa.

50:02.165 --> 50:03.624
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

50:04.584 --> 50:06.752
Why would he give you
that much booze?

50:07.004 --> 50:09.964
He didn't give it to me.
I traded him for it.

50:10.882 --> 50:12.049
Traded him what?

50:12.300 --> 50:15.469
I traded him a Montagnard crossbow...

50:15.721 --> 50:18.556
...a number one address
on Chu Do Street...

50:18.807 --> 50:20.558
...and a pair of Ho Chi Minh sandals.

50:20.809 --> 50:23.769
And where did you get
a pair of Ho Chi Minh sandals?

50:24.938 --> 50:25.980
I made them.

50:27.858 --> 50:30.818
I work hard.
I've gone to church.

50:31.069 --> 50:32.862
I was a Boy Scout.

50:33.113 --> 50:34.864
I was an Eagle Scout!

50:35.449 --> 50:36.991
He's funny!

50:37.409 --> 50:39.577
How did you get in here?

50:41.163 --> 50:42.538
Where do you sleep?

50:44.666 --> 50:46.292
Where's...?

50:47.294 --> 50:48.544
Anywhere.

51:08.774 --> 51:10.900
All right, come here.

51:51.858 --> 51:53.818
JAMlSON: Colonel Kirby?
KlRBY: Affirmative!

51:53.985 --> 51:56.612
Lt. Jamison, 91 st Navy Seabee
detachment out of Cho Min.

51:56.863 --> 51:58.572
This is Captain MacDaniel.

51:58.824 --> 52:02.076
We'd have come sooner, but the
Marines wanted a strip up north.

52:02.327 --> 52:05.788
It's going to get a little hairy
around here, Lieutenant...

52:06.039 --> 52:08.332
...so we're glad to see you,
late or not.

52:08.583 --> 52:11.919
The rest of my outfit will be coming
with the heavy equipment.

52:25.892 --> 52:27.893
They set it down
right where the work is.

52:28.145 --> 52:31.939
-How's that, sir?
-Could you move that jungle back for us?

52:32.190 --> 52:34.567
Just say the word,
and l'll move it to China.

52:34.818 --> 52:38.070
We don't need that much.
Just a clear killing zone.

52:38.446 --> 52:40.156
-Will do, sir.
-Watson!

52:40.323 --> 52:42.032
Arrange pads. How many men?

52:42.284 --> 52:44.451
-Thirteen.
-Lucky number.

52:44.703 --> 52:45.953
Thirteen. Hop to it!

52:46.204 --> 52:49.373
-l'd like to run an equipment check.
-Go ahead.

52:52.002 --> 52:53.669
Sight for sore eyes.

53:33.501 --> 53:35.461
That thing sure does a day's work!

53:35.712 --> 53:37.963
Easier than mowing the lawn.

53:54.564 --> 53:57.399
Everybody's as busy as little bees.

54:31.559 --> 54:33.686
Hello, Charlie.

54:35.855 --> 54:38.399
Get me Captain Nim and Colonel Kirby!

54:40.527 --> 54:41.735
NIM:
What are the charges?

54:41.945 --> 54:45.948
He was pacing off the distance
between the wall and the team house.

54:46.199 --> 54:48.075
We could've caught a round tonight.

54:48.743 --> 54:52.621
I certainly hope you can
prove that, sergeant.

-Very interesting.

01:44:11.745 --> 01:44:14.038
I attended a meeting
with the premier and his staff.

01:44:14.373 --> 01:44:17.625
The main subject
was General Pham Son Ti.

01:44:17.834 --> 01:44:21.837
He has assumed command of the
entire Viet Cong forces in the south.

01:44:22.214 --> 01:44:24.006
Which makes him Number One!

01:44:24.258 --> 01:44:27.009
Affirmative.
And it could mean a major offensive.

01:44:27.261 --> 01:44:30.263
I had my hands on him
the last time l was out here.

01:44:30.514 --> 01:44:34.850
But because of political pressure,
I had to turn him loose.

01:44:37.604 --> 01:44:42.358
Who wouldn't? But if l know General Ti,
he's surrounded by a regiment.

01:44:42.609 --> 01:44:45.820
-My people think several.
-That brings us up to the plan.

01:44:46.321 --> 01:44:48.072
He's somewhere
in Hang Phau Valley.

01:44:48.323 --> 01:44:51.033
Surrounded by the regiments
you mentioned, which makes...

01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:53.119
...a capture impossible.

01:44:53.370 --> 01:44:55.830
Precisely.
Except for one woman...

01:44:56.373 --> 01:44:58.958
...and a certain hand-picked team.

01:45:00.419 --> 01:45:02.211
Go on, colonel.

01:45:04.589 --> 01:45:05.798
This is the rat.

01:45:09.052 --> 01:45:10.803
And this is the trap.

01:45:14.933 --> 01:45:17.393
My father was a simple man.

01:45:18.312 --> 01:45:20.646
All he wanted was to be free...

01:45:21.648 --> 01:45:25.359
...his wife to love,
and his children to raise.

01:45:25.610 --> 01:45:29.780
He tried to remain neutral.
That was his mistake.

01:45:31.199 --> 01:45:33.868
What he didn't realize...

01:45:34.119 --> 01:45:37.038
...was that man has to pay a price
for that freedom.

01:45:38.623 --> 01:45:41.834
Therefore, he suffered
the ultimate penalty.

01:45:43.962 --> 01:45:46.005
Since that day...

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:49.383
...l've lived but with one thought:

01:45:49.968 --> 01:45:53.220
To find the man who ordered
my father and little brother murdered.

01:45:55.807 --> 01:45:57.183
I found him.

01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:00.853
His name is Pham Son Ti.

01:46:02.272 --> 01:46:04.398

01:46:05.317 --> 01:46:06.359

01:46:06.818 --> 01:46:10.571
One week from tonight,
at the old Costeau Plantation.

01:46:29.299 --> 01:46:30.841

01:46:31.009 --> 01:46:33.677
...how much do you know about this girl?

01:46:33.929 --> 01:46:37.264
Her father and General Ti's father
grew up together.

01:46:37.516 --> 01:46:39.892
Their families were very close.

01:46:40.143 --> 01:46:42.686
Even before he moved to Hanoi...

01:46:42.938 --> 01:46:45.648
...he had more
than a friendly interest in Lin.

01:46:45.899 --> 01:46:47.316

01:46:47.567 --> 01:46:49.193

Let's relax.

02:13:40.303 --> 02:13:41.387
Colonel?

02:13:43.557 --> 02:13:46.225
-She's your sister-in-law.
-She is.

02:13:47.936 --> 02:13:51.063
Her whole future, her self-respect...

02:13:52.232 --> 02:13:53.983
...everything is in your hands.

02:13:56.903 --> 02:13:58.738
It isn't that l....

02:14:03.994 --> 02:14:05.995
Thank you.

02:14:13.420 --> 02:14:14.795
Lin?

02:14:16.631 --> 02:14:18.549
You're a brave woman.

02:14:20.719 --> 02:14:25.347
No, just a woman praying
that her family will forgive her.

02:14:26.224 --> 02:14:28.350
There is nothing to forgive.

02:14:42.199 --> 02:14:44.200
I thought you'd never get here.

02:14:44.451 --> 02:14:47.161
-Choppers are coming up the valley.
-Where's Doc?

02:14:47.370 --> 02:14:50.289
Caught one in the back,
but he's going to be all right.

02:14:50.540 --> 02:14:52.500
Let's get the colonel.

02:15:01.968 --> 02:15:04.053
MULDOON:
LZ is a meadow just over that rise.

02:15:04.304 --> 02:15:05.805
Let's move out!

02:15:17.275 --> 02:15:18.442
MULDOON:
Petersen!

02:15:22.030 --> 02:15:23.155
Bastards!

02:15:25.158 --> 02:15:27.910
Move out. Move out.

02:15:28.078 --> 02:15:29.620
You heard him, let's go!

02:15:53.103 --> 02:15:56.438
BECKWORTH: What area's
designated as offloading ramp today?

02:15:56.690 --> 02:15:59.692
M.P.:
Last pad over, next to the water.

02:16:14.457 --> 02:16:17.126
-See that runway over by the beach?
-Yeah?

02:16:17.836 --> 02:16:20.546
That's where your Peter-san's
going to be coming in.

02:16:20.964 --> 02:16:22.756
You take care of yourself.

02:16:24.050 --> 02:16:25.301
Thank you.

02:17:01.296 --> 02:17:04.005
-Mister, you Beckworth?
-That's right.

02:17:04.257 --> 02:17:08.052
If you want to go where the war is,
this is the way.

02:17:25.528 --> 02:17:28.405
-Who's that for?
-l don't know, boy.

02:17:30.867 --> 02:17:33.576
Wait until the choppers are down.

02:18:05.442 --> 02:18:08.736
I got a Jeep for you and Mrs. Cai.

02:18:10.906 --> 02:18:13.032
Successful mission.

02:18:13.951 --> 02:18:15.076
Yeah.

02:18:15.787 --> 02:18:17.162
But very costly.

02:18:17.414 --> 02:18:19.248
HAMCHUNK:
Petersen!

02:18:23.210 --> 02:18:24.837
HAMCHUNK:
Is there Petersen here?

02:18:25.088 --> 02:18:28.590
PlLOT: Must be in another chopper,
sonny. Not here.

02:18:32.429 --> 02:18:33.762
MULDOON:
Medic!

02:18:40.227 --> 02:18:42.563
HAMCHUNK: What happened?
MULDOON: It's Doc, Hamchunk.

02:18:42.731 --> 02:18:44.647
He's going to be all right.

02:18:47.777 --> 02:18:49.111
HAMCHUNK:
Petersen?

02:18:49.321 --> 02:18:52.156
There's none of them left in here.

02:19:06.754 --> 02:19:09.715
This is one job I don't envy you.

02:19:13.678 --> 02:19:14.969
HAMCHUNK:
Petersen!

02:19:15.972 --> 02:19:29.651
Petersen!

02:19:34.907 --> 02:19:37.284
No! No!

02:20:11.778 --> 02:20:13.028
Hamchunk?

02:20:16.157 --> 02:20:18.951
You always knew
it could happen, didn't you?

02:20:19.619 --> 02:20:21.703
But l didn't want it to.

02:20:22.539 --> 02:20:24.206
None of us did.

02:20:26.501 --> 02:20:29.086
Was my Peter-san brave?

02:20:32.924 --> 02:20:34.341
He was very brave.

02:20:34.926 --> 02:20:36.260
Are you going to be?

02:20:37.095 --> 02:20:38.595
I'll try.

02:20:39.264 --> 02:20:40.597
I know you will.

02:20:41.808 --> 02:20:43.684
And l'm sure that...

02:20:44.519 --> 02:20:46.478
...your Peter-san...

02:20:47.439 --> 02:20:49.690
...would want you to have that.

02:20:53.069 --> 02:20:55.571
What will happen to me now?

02:20:59.451 --> 02:21:02.161
You let me worry about that,
Green Beret.

02:21:03.204 --> 02:21:05.289
You're what this is all about.

02:21:52.420 --> 02:21:54.421
