And I, of course,
am your driver, Gigi Hadid.

00:21.438 --> 00:25.191
After Paxton had reminded these twerps
that he was still king of this jungle,

00:25.275 --> 00:26.901
things have been going great.

00:26.985 --> 00:29.696
He was invited to every rager,
kegger, and kickback.

00:29.779 --> 00:32.741
And honestly,
he had all but forgotten about ASU.

his same high school life,

00:42.667 --> 00:44.002
but with a nicer bathroom.

00:44.085 --> 00:47.172
And all he had to do was
coach a little swimming and show up

00:47.255 --> 00:49.466
to a few mandatory staff meetings,
like this one.

00:49.549 --> 00:53.344
So I'm looking for a few more volunteers
to take calls on the teen help hotline.

00:53.428 --> 00:54.888
So far, it's just me and Lyle.

00:54.971 --> 00:58.683
Some days, it feels like the students
help me more than I help them.

00:58.767 --> 01:01.519
That has overwhelmingly been the case.

01:01.603 --> 01:05.273

for anyone else to help out. Please.

that Paxton's current life

01:27.670 --> 01:29.839
wasn't exactly what he'd planned
for himself,

01:29.923 --> 01:33.510
but he was good at stuffing those feelings
of regret deep down inside

01:33.593 --> 01:35.887
until they were nothing more
than a little indigestion.

01:35.970 --> 01:38.473

09:30.069 --> 09:31.779
It kind of just appeared on my doorstep.

09:31.862 --> 09:33.948
So, how come you don't look like
you're having any fun?

09:34.031 --> 09:35.533
Shouldn't you be holding Trent's feet?

09:35.616 --> 09:37.618
[Trent] Yeah, get me down.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.328
Oh, that was sick.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.330
What the hell? Who brought a keg?

09:41.414 --> 09:43.791
I don't know, but this is like
the biggest party of the year,

09:43.874 --> 09:45.251
and it's being hosted by a teacher.

09:45.334 --> 09:47.378
Yeah, I think that might be a problem.

09:47.461 --> 09:49.213
I mean, what if someone finds out
about this?

09:49.297 --> 09:50.715
Nah, no one's gonna tell.

09:50.798 --> 09:52.842
You've been to tons of parties
since you've been back.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.678
-And no one has said anything.
-Yeah, but I haven't thrown a party.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.930
This feels different
in, like, a not great way.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.683
Do you want me to get rid of everyone?
I know how to clear a room.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.728
I can totally whip up
a classic Devi meltdown just like that.

10:03.811 --> 10:04.979
-[chuckles]
-[Trent] Yeah.

10:05.062 --> 10:06.772
[grunting]

10:06.856 --> 10:09.525
I feel sexy.
I just feel sexy, you know what I mean?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.152
You know what? No.

10:11.235 --> 10:14.947
I think I probably just need to relax.
It is a pretty good party, isn't it?

10:15.031 --> 10:18.034
Uh, nuh doy, it's fire.
Let's do a shot, bro.

10:18.117 --> 10:20.578
-All right, yeah, why not?
-Okay. I'll be right back.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.580
[knocking on door]

10:22.663 --> 10:23.664
Okay.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.583
[indistinct chatter]

10:28.544 --> 10:29.378
Paxton?

10:30.087 --> 10:31.631
Lindsay. Hey.

10:32.256 --> 10:36.844
Um, a drunk kid called the student hotline
and asked for a ride home from this party.

10:36.927 --> 10:37.970
Did they call you too?

10:38.054 --> 10:39.639
Here you go, one shot of…

10:41.140 --> 10:42.058
apple juice.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.476
-Hi, Miss Thompson.
-Hi.

10:43.559 --> 10:44.393
Okay.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.228
Professor Yoshida-Hall.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.272
-I drank too much at your party.
-Oh my God.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.524
Mr. Thompson,
does your car have a back seat?

10:50.608 --> 10:52.401
Because I'd like to lie down.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.820
Wait, this is your house?

10:54.904 --> 10:56.864
You're having a party
with all these students?

10:56.947 --> 10:58.491
Okay, it's actually a funny story.

10:58.574 --> 11:00.701
-I got an Oculus recently--
-[Gerard] Ahh!

11:00.785 --> 11:01.952
-Damn.
-Oh.

11:02.578 --> 11:06.123
Oh my God.
Um, yeah, I can't be here. I gotta go.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.625
Lindsay, wait--

11:07.708 --> 11:09.669
Gerard, come on. Let's go.

11:10.252 --> 11:12.421
Oh gosh. Oh my God. Okay.

11:13.381 --> 11:16.133
[Hadid] Paxton showed up to school
the following Monday

11:16.217 --> 11:18.761
anxious to smooth things over
with Miss Thompson,

11:18.844 --> 11:21.013
and hopefully keep his job in the process.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.765
Linds. All right, listen.

11:22.848 --> 11:25.476
I swear I did not plan
for that to be a party, all right?

11:25.559 --> 11:27.770
I had a couple friends over,
then people kept showing up--

11:27.853 --> 11:29.730
You know you're a grown-up, right?

11:29.814 --> 11:31.482
If drunk people showed up to my apartment,

11:31.565 --> 11:33.484
I'd be like, "No, thank you,"
and close the door.

11:33.567 --> 11:34.610
It's not that simple.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.821
No, it is that simple.

11:36.904 --> 11:39.031
I mean, you're a staff member,
and they're students.

11:39.615 --> 11:42.827
Look, I… I'm not gonna narc on you,
but grown-up to grown-up?

11:43.327 --> 11:44.286
What are you doing?

11:44.829 --> 11:46.163
Get your shit together, dude.

11:46.247 --> 11:48.249
[gentle music playing]

11:51.961 --> 11:53.087
[Hadid] Later that afternoon,

11:53.170 --> 11:55.881
Miss Thompson's words
were still ringing in his ear.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.091
What was he doing?

11:58.426 --> 12:00.469
Why was he back at his high school?

12:00.553 --> 12:03.931
And how did he end up training
the most annoying person on Earth?

12:04.014 --> 12:06.642
Okay, so I was reading
Michael Phelps's biography,

12:06.726 --> 12:08.602
and he had a bit of a head start on me.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.771
So we're gonna have to pump up
our training sessions

12:10.855 --> 12:12.982
to, like, three times a week
to bridge that gap.

12:13.065 --> 12:16.736
Dude, there is literally nothing you can
physically do to be Michael Phelps.

12:17.319 --> 12:19.321
And frankly,
I don't know why you're trying.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.825
Not to be a dick,
but you're really not good at swimming.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.243
Are you negging me?

12:24.326 --> 12:26.412
Because it's working, Coach.
I'm fired up now.

12:26.495 --> 12:27.705
I'm serious.

12:27.788 --> 12:30.791
Like, what is making you keep going?
Why not just give up?

12:30.875 --> 12:32.835
Why would I give up? We barely started.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.296
Because it's going to be
a super hard, uphill climb?

12:35.379 --> 12:36.922
You don't think I know that?

12:37.006 --> 12:40.259
I've almost drowned several times.
There's still water somewhere in my head.

12:40.342 --> 12:44.180
So why not stick to stuff you're good at?
Like robots and tuba.

12:44.263 --> 12:47.391
Look, why are you setting a goal
that you're probably gonna fail at?

12:47.475 --> 12:50.686
It's okay if I fail as long as I tried.

12:50.770 --> 12:54.315
And maybe I don't fail,
and then I'm really proud of myself.

12:54.815 --> 12:56.734
What kind of person
just gives up on their dream

12:56.817 --> 12:58.569
when they haven't even tried?

12:58.652 --> 13:00.863
[Hadid] Yeah, Paxton, who would do that?

13:01.363 --> 13:02.948
You know anyone who would do that?

13:03.532 --> 13:06.076
-You really want this?
-More than anything in the world.

13:07.828 --> 13:09.497
Then let's make you a jock.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.499
-Nice! [yelps]
-[Paxton] Oh!

13:12.875 --> 13:13.876
You good?

13:14.710 --> 13:15.544
I'm all right.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.629
All right, let's go.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.173
All right, you ready?

13:19.757 --> 13:21.926
On your mark, get set…

13:22.009 --> 13:22.968
[whistle blows]

13:23.052 --> 13:24.887
Come on, you got this. Let's go.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.722
["Chain Reaction" by Cobra Man playing]

13:26.806 --> 13:27.681
[gasping]

13:29.642 --> 13:30.559
How was that?

13:31.185 --> 13:32.061
We can do better.

13:32.561 --> 13:33.729
A lot… better.

13:33.813 --> 13:34.730
Do it again.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.900
Okay, I'm gonna swim with you this time.

13:37.983 --> 13:40.694
Don't try and beat me,
just try to match my pace. Got it?

13:40.778 --> 13:41.695
-Got it.
-All right.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.781
["Chain Reaction" continues playing]

13:47.993 --> 13:49.328
I mean, who was that for?

13:50.621 --> 13:51.872
What are you talking about?

13:52.873 --> 13:56.502
That's right, come on, let's go, let's go.
Come on, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig!

13:56.585 --> 13:57.503
[gasping]

13:58.712 --> 14:00.840
We can do better. Come on, do it again.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.050
[Eric gasping]

14:03.759 --> 14:07.096
It's easy, all right? So like this,
and the water is coming up here.

14:07.179 --> 14:10.140
You're going side--
No. Eric, it… it's over.

14:12.017 --> 14:12.977
Uh--

14:16.105 --> 14:18.357
[Paxton] Come on,
come on, come on, come on.

14:18.440 --> 14:19.817
Come on, come on, push.

14:19.900 --> 14:20.943
Push.

14:21.026 --> 14:22.611
Yes! Yes! Yes!

14:22.695 --> 14:24.613
That's my boy! Whoo!

14:24.697 --> 14:27.366
Did I do it, Paxy? Did I make you proud?

14:27.449 --> 14:28.325
Yes.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.996
Trust-- Whoa, okay, noodle.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.664
-Noodle!
-[Eric gasps]

14:33.747 --> 14:34.957
Thank you.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.586
That was great, man. I mean,
I can't believe I'm actually saying this,

14:38.669 --> 14:41.964
but if you can swim like that in front of
Coach Noble, you might have a shot.

14:42.047 --> 14:45.426
Thank you, Paxton. If I could move
my shoulders right now, I'd hug you.

14:45.509 --> 14:48.012
-No problem, man. I'll set it up.
-[chuckles] Ow.

14:48.095 --> 14:49.013
My bad.

14:51.348 --> 14:53.100
Damn, you're a miracle worker.

14:53.183 --> 14:54.977
I can't believe how good he's gotten.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.564
-I lost a lot of money to Janitor Stacy.
-Wait, you bet against me?

14:58.647 --> 15:00.190
The odds were not in your favor.

15:00.274 --> 15:02.067
That's definitely true.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.778
And, yeah, that weird little dude
is actually sort of good now.

15:04.862 --> 15:05.738
[Devi] Hmm.

15:05.821 --> 15:08.949
There's still a pretty decent chance
he blows it in front of Coach Noble,

15:09.033 --> 15:11.410
but I gotta say,
I'm feeling kind of hopeful.

15:14.371 --> 15:17.499
Oh no. Did you move those kick boards
that were holding the door open?

15:17.583 --> 15:19.418
Yeah, that's them in your hand.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.378
Okay. We're stuck in here.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.671
Uh, maybe not.

15:22.755 --> 15:23.714
[doorknob rattling]

15:24.256 --> 15:26.550
Okay, yeah. But hey, it's all right.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.052
-We can call someone.
-[Devi] Hmm.

15:28.135 --> 15:31.513
Although my phone is out by the pool.
Do you have yours?

15:31.597 --> 15:33.891
Mine's in my backpack
in the girls' locker room.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.935
That's okay. We're okay.

15:36.018 --> 15:39.063
Um, I was supposed to meet
with Coach Noble after our practice,

15:39.146 --> 15:41.941
so when I don't show up,
he'll definitely come looking for me.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.360
[snoring]

15:47.947 --> 15:49.156
[Devi sighs]

15:49.239 --> 15:50.908
I can't believe I don't have my phone.

15:50.991 --> 15:53.160
What if Akshara from Princeton
called me back?

15:53.243 --> 15:55.204
I told her I'm available
any time of the day

15:55.287 --> 15:57.539
in the last ten voicemails
that I left her.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.584
Hey, I don't know much
about college admissions,

16:00.668 --> 16:04.546
but I do know about getting
too many calls from thirsty girls,

16:04.630 --> 16:06.799
and you're not coming off well.

16:06.882 --> 16:09.009
-How dare you?
-I'm just being honest.

16:09.093 --> 16:12.554
I don't think it would hurt you
to play it a little more… cool.

16:13.555 --> 16:14.682
-Really?
-Yeah.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.935
Okay. Maybe you have a point.

16:18.018 --> 16:18.978
[chuckles softly]

16:19.061 --> 16:21.355
Well, since we're trapped here,

16:21.438 --> 16:24.358
and apparently experimenting
with radical honesty…

16:24.441 --> 16:25.484
[inhales deeply]

16:28.988 --> 16:31.115
…can I ask what really happened at ASU?

16:33.033 --> 16:37.413
The reason I left was because…
no one there liked me.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.373
What? How is that possible?

16:39.456 --> 16:40.332
I don't know.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.044
Everyone just decided
I was some huge loser,

16:44.128 --> 16:47.172
and I was just like,
maybe I don't belong at college.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.757
So I left.

16:48.841 --> 16:52.177
And now every day I'm like,
"What did you do?"

16:52.261 --> 16:57.266
So I guess being hot all your life
actually turned out to be a disadvantage.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.517
[laughs]

16:58.600 --> 17:00.811
Yeah, I guess so.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.397
Well… damn.

17:03.897 --> 17:08.694
I mean, I've been working so hard to be
this cool, sexually-successful senior,

17:08.777 --> 17:11.196
but maybe I'll have to glow back down
before I go to college.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.239
Yeah, you might.

17:12.322 --> 17:13.949
[lips smacking] Hmm.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.952
Wait, did you say "sexually successful"?

17:18.454 --> 17:19.705
No, no, hold up.

17:20.706 --> 17:22.916
-[giggles]
-Wait, wait, is it that Ethan kid?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.126
-Yeah.
-Shut up.

17:24.209 --> 17:26.211
Well, actually, Ben first, but he--

17:26.295 --> 17:28.756
-Ben? Gross?
-[laughs]

17:28.839 --> 17:30.966
-What?! [laughs]
-Doesn't matter.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.010
You heard it here, she bangs.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.344
-Damn.
-Mm-hmm.

17:34.428 --> 17:35.804
-Okay. [laughs]
-[chuckles]

17:36.346 --> 17:37.347
Yeah, congrats.

17:37.931 --> 17:39.266
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

17:39.349 --> 17:40.601
[both chuckle]

17:41.185 --> 17:42.102
[inhales deeply]

17:42.978 --> 17:46.565
You know, I really thought
it was gonna be you.

17:46.648 --> 17:47.608
Why?

17:47.691 --> 17:49.443
Because you came up to me out of nowhere

17:49.526 --> 17:51.779
and asked me to take your virginity
as a complete stranger?

17:51.862 --> 17:55.365
Okay, don't make me sound like I'm nuts.
You're the one that said yes.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.117
Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.163
You know what I think about a lot?

18:02.039 --> 18:02.873
What?

18:04.500 --> 18:06.710
What you said to me when we broke up.

18:07.461 --> 18:08.545
What did I say?

18:08.629 --> 18:09.671
[Devi sighs]

18:10.172 --> 18:13.509
You told me that we couldn't be together
until I liked myself.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.720
-Damn. I said that?
-[chuckles softly]

18:16.804 --> 18:18.388
That's pretty cold.

18:18.472 --> 18:22.434
I… I mean… you weren't wrong.
I was kind of a maniac.

18:23.018 --> 18:23.977
Maybe a little bit.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.522
Hey, look at this role reversal.

18:26.605 --> 18:30.150
I mean, I'm this cool jock,
and you're this big dork.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.735
[tsks, chuckles]

18:33.779 --> 18:35.030
For the first time,

18:35.864 --> 18:37.658
I feel like we're equals.

18:37.741 --> 18:39.076
Equals?

a student here less than a year ago.
