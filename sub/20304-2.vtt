00:01.042 --> 00:03.503
NARRATOR:
<i>Coming tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.586 --> 00:04.838
Freeze! Police!

00:06.589 --> 00:09.217
You do anything, she bites it!
She bites it!

00:09.300 --> 00:12.053
He called me into his office
and stood up behind his desk,

00:12.137 --> 00:14.014
naked from the waist down.

00:14.097 --> 00:16.349
Are you continuing to maintain
you had no knowledge

00:16.433 --> 00:19.936
of officers using the Downtowner Lodge
to sleep, play poker

00:20.020 --> 00:22.147
and engage in sexual liaisons
during working hours?

00:22.230 --> 00:23.148
Correct.

00:23.231 --> 00:26.359
Lou, I can only conclude that you turned
your back on the whole situation.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.194
Excuse me, Miss Davenport.

00:29.904 --> 00:31.698
Could we-- Would you mind?

00:31.781 --> 00:33.700
-Yes, of course.
-Thank you very much.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.828
Frank, I want you to meet Jon Gennaro.

00:36.911 --> 00:38.872
Jon, Frank Furillo.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.583
<i>Street Dogs, </i>Frank. Jon's new film.

00:41.666 --> 00:44.252
I'm not gonna, uh, bore you
with any long speeches.

00:44.335 --> 00:46.796
Uh, I'll leave that to our guest of honor.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.214
-(laughter)
-Chief Daniels.

00:49.174 --> 00:52.135
Sounds like somebody could have died
in there. You better break it in.

00:52.218 --> 00:53.470
All right, give me some room here.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.055
-Ma'am.
-Come on!

00:55.263 --> 00:57.182
-Just--
-Stand back.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.019
Oh, my God.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.735
(chattering)

01:11.446 --> 01:12.697
PHIL: Item nine,

01:13.156 --> 01:14.616
which, for lack
of a more suitable epithet,

01:14.699 --> 01:16.868
we will merely refer to as the weather.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.330
Extended forecasts, people,
prepared in cooperation

01:20.413 --> 01:22.457
with the National Weather Service.

01:22.707 --> 01:26.002
High pressure system maintaining
for the southeastern tier.

01:26.336 --> 01:29.214
Relative humidity, 98.9 percent.
Wind, negligible.

01:29.297 --> 01:34.302
Overnight low, 82 degrees.
Current at City Hall, 86 degrees.

01:34.844 --> 01:38.723
Daytime high expected, 101 degrees.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.767
(all groaning)

01:40.850 --> 01:42.519
Loosely translated, my hearties,

01:42.602 --> 01:45.980
those of you vacationing
at Shoreside Condominiums this week

01:46.314 --> 01:50.026
can look forward to at least three
more days of chart-breaking sunshine.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.654
Those of you involved
in more civic pursuits

01:52.737 --> 01:56.366
can expect a heat-related 30 percent
rise in felonious assault,

01:56.449 --> 01:58.868
25 percent rise in 2-11's,

01:58.952 --> 02:01.913
particularly liquor
and appliance store-wise.

02:01.996 --> 02:06.543
A consequent 120 percent increase
in public intoxication

02:07.293 --> 02:09.003
and, most critically, people,

02:09.087 --> 02:13.550
a domestic disturbance jump
of a whopping 200 percent.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.760
(groaning)

02:15.844 --> 02:18.012
Item ten, in light of the continuing

02:18.096 --> 02:20.348
and deplorable armed robberies

02:20.431 --> 02:23.101
of local ice cream vendors
this past month,

02:23.768 --> 02:26.062
Detectives Belker and Goldblume
will undertake

02:26.146 --> 02:28.148
a second day of undercover assignment

02:28.231 --> 02:31.317
as DeGaetano Ice Cream drivers.

02:32.068 --> 02:33.862
Ice cream!

02:33.945 --> 02:35.697
Nobody's gonna buy ice cream from Belker.

02:36.447 --> 02:40.368
PHIL: Notwithstanding, plainclothes backup
by Detectives Ruiz and Munster.

02:40.451 --> 02:43.371
Now, let us all keep our various
ears peeled

02:43.454 --> 02:46.040
to any radio assistance requests.

02:47.333 --> 02:51.379
Item 11. Come on, people! Last item!

02:51.462 --> 02:53.173
A little forbearance.

02:53.882 --> 02:57.093
A divisional memo regarding
this evening's all-precinct,

02:57.343 --> 02:59.220
forgive the expression, roast.

03:00.430 --> 03:04.225
Commemorating Chief Daniels's 25th
anniversary in the department...

03:04.309 --> 03:06.060
(booing)

03:06.144 --> 03:08.479
...to be held at 7:00 p.m.
in the air-conditioned

03:08.563 --> 03:10.982
Tahitian room of the Kubiak Lodge

03:11.065 --> 03:13.526
and featuring on stage, I might add,

03:13.610 --> 03:18.281
a good half dozen
of law enforcement's most acerbic

03:18.364 --> 03:21.868
and rapier-witted roast raconteurs...

03:21.951 --> 03:23.995
(laughing)

03:24.078 --> 03:27.457
...not the least of which being our own
Captain Francis X. Furillo,

03:27.540 --> 03:30.293
along with Lieutenants Calletano
and Hunter.

03:31.002 --> 03:33.588
Though tickets have been moving
at an extremely brisk pace...

03:33.671 --> 03:35.340
(laughing)

03:35.423 --> 03:38.509
...be assured a good 80 percent
of the best tables are yet available.

03:38.593 --> 03:41.930
-(laughing)
-A final cautionary note, people.

03:42.513 --> 03:45.475
Let's learn a lesson
from Officer William Ludwig,

03:45.767 --> 03:48.269
who, as many of you know,
took four inches of barbecue fork

03:48.353 --> 03:50.104
in the right lung last night

03:50.480 --> 03:53.274
while answering a domestic call
on East Utica.

03:53.691 --> 03:56.778
To paraphrase the venerable writer
of<i> Marlowe,</i>

03:57.278 --> 04:01.074
it's the kind of heat that makes
every gin-mill wisecrack

04:01.157 --> 04:02.784
a homicide stat.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.411
It's the kind of heat

04:06.246 --> 04:08.581
that makes even the meekest housewife

04:08.665 --> 04:12.585
feel the edge of the bread knife
as she eyes her husband's neck.

04:13.294 --> 04:15.171
You see why I didn't get married, huh?

04:16.798 --> 04:19.759
So, while all those about us
are losing their cool,

04:19.842 --> 04:22.929
let's endeavor, shall we, to keep ours.

04:24.889 --> 04:27.100
All right. That's it. Let's roll.

04:27.183 --> 04:30.019
And let's be careful out there.

04:38.319 --> 04:40.196
-You know, you look great when you sweat.
-Thank you very much.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.532
7:30 in the morning,
and I'm perspiring already.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.450
Tell me something
I haven't already smelled.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.660
It ain't because of work.

04:45.743 --> 04:47.704
-It's because I couldn't--
-Captain.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.296
Overheated garbage truck
in the Delaware Avenue underpass.

04:57.255 --> 05:00.091
Thirty-four minutes, Leo,
34 minutes to go two blocks!

05:01.884 --> 05:04.554
Neal, I'm not talking
about some graveyard shift

05:04.637 --> 05:06.180
rent-a-cop gig in Cleveland, you know.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.391
I'm talking executive security management

05:08.474 --> 05:10.727
of the third largest
resort hotel in the Bahamas.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.521
Man, look! Beaches, Neal.

05:14.355 --> 05:15.648
Swimming pools.

05:16.024 --> 05:19.652
More first-rate tropical booty
than you can shake your snorkel at.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.529
Look, babe,
I know you went through a lot of trouble

05:21.612 --> 05:22.780
lining up this interview for us,

05:22.864 --> 05:25.867
but I guess I'm just kind of attached
to this town, you know?

05:25.950 --> 05:28.411
Oh! Hey, me, too! Hey, don't get me wrong.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.372
Hell, I love junkies getting sick
on my shoes twice a week.

05:31.456 --> 05:35.543
I get off on transvestites, dried blood,
people lunging at me with barbecue forks.

05:35.626 --> 05:37.670
Oh, yeah. This town? Regular joy machine.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.715
I can't take it no more! I can't take it!

05:40.923 --> 05:45.845
I can't take it! I can't take it!
I can't take it anymore!

05:45.928 --> 05:49.182
-I can't take it! I can't take it!
-The Bahamas, Neal.

05:49.640 --> 05:52.435
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:52.518 --> 05:54.479
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:54.562 --> 05:58.149
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:58.232 --> 05:59.817
(sirens wailing)

06:05.281 --> 06:09.202
(theme music playing)

07:13.516 --> 07:16.894
"And when the chief came home
and saw the car in the living room,

07:17.061 --> 07:18.438
he asked his wife,

07:18.646 --> 07:20.731
'How did you get the car
in the living room?'

07:20.982 --> 07:25.361
And she said, 'It was easy, Fletcher.
I drove it through the kitchen.'"

07:26.070 --> 07:28.072
Now, you tell me that's not funny!

07:28.865 --> 07:30.408
Humor as a second language, Frank.

07:30.491 --> 07:33.453
I've been trying to make our old<i> amigo</i>
here understand

07:33.536 --> 07:38.374
that it is probably the most semantically
demanding genre of the English language.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.586
(chuckles)
Tito Puente, by way of the Catskills.

07:41.669 --> 07:44.380
I suppose you can do better, Howard.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.966
Oh, well, listen, I spent over three hours

07:47.049 --> 07:49.051
last night trying to come up
with one-liners.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.637
I couldn't come up with enough
to fill one index card.

07:52.096 --> 07:55.475
Oh, courage, old sport.
You're among friends.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.480
How's this for openers?

08:01.647 --> 08:03.608
Okay.
"A lot of people have accused our chief

08:03.691 --> 08:05.318
of being somewhat tight with a dollar.

08:05.401 --> 08:06.777
This is patently untrue.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.404
Why, just last week
he gave his wife a necklace

08:08.488 --> 08:09.989
that once belonged to Woolworth's."

08:11.574 --> 08:13.534
Uh, yeah, well,
and speaking of chokeholds...

08:13.618 --> 08:15.495
JOE: That once belonged to a millionaire.

08:16.579 --> 08:17.580
Excuse me, Joe?

08:18.998 --> 08:20.500
It needs the extra beat, Captain.

08:20.708 --> 08:24.128
He gave his wife a necklace that once
belonged to a millionaire, Woolworth.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.963
(laughs) I like that.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.591
Good. Hey, Joe,
you have any more of these?

08:28.674 --> 08:32.929
Yeah. My cousin Vinnie used to do stand-up
openers in Jersey for Vic Damone.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.848
-Vic Damone?
-Try this one on for size.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.350
Talk about cheap.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.853
Chief Daniels keeps $10 bills
folded up in his pocket so long,

08:40.937 --> 08:43.564
-Hamilton gets ingrown whiskers.
-RAY: That's terrific!

08:43.731 --> 08:45.525
He tears the December
page off the calendar

08:45.608 --> 08:47.401
at Christmastime to fool his kids.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.947
He takes their glasses off
when they're not looking at anything.

08:51.030 --> 08:54.325
-Not so fast, Joseph, please!
-I don't get that one.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.577
-Well, he takes their glasses off--
-Captain! Sorry.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.829
You're due at the Board of Rights hearing
in 20 minutes.

08:58.913 --> 09:01.249
Oh, thanks, Leo. Gentlemen, excuse me.

09:01.332 --> 09:03.042
Joe, can I have a minute, please?

09:03.793 --> 09:07.088
Uh, listen, you could really bail us out
tonight, you know.

09:07.171 --> 09:10.216
If you could work out
a five-minute routine for the roast.

09:10.299 --> 09:12.635
-I don't know, Captain. I've never real--
-Tickets are on me.

09:12.718 --> 09:15.513
-Appreciate it.
-Yo, Shecky!

09:16.472 --> 09:19.350
We got a domestic situation
down on Lynwood Avenue.

09:19.850 --> 09:23.479
Oh, terrific. Hot weather domestic,
night of my big debut.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.357
I'm probably gonna end up getting shot
in some two-bit tenement.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.818
Better there than on stage, huh?
Ooh, what's that?

09:28.901 --> 09:31.821
Oh! It's a joke! It's a little joke!

09:39.870 --> 09:42.623
(children chattering)

09:42.707 --> 09:46.711
(radio chatter)

09:48.629 --> 09:51.549
-JOE: Open up! This is the police!
-Do you have a key for the door?

09:51.632 --> 09:55.136
That nasty old fool
installed his own dead bolt!

09:55.219 --> 09:57.638
No key. It sounds like
somebody's gonna die in there.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.391
-You better break it in.
-All right. Give me some room here.

10:00.474 --> 10:02.059
-Ma'am.
-Come on!

10:02.143 --> 10:03.227
-Just--
-What's he gonna do?

10:03.311 --> 10:05.688
-Step back!
-(groans)

10:07.982 --> 10:11.110
-Please, give me some room!
-Oh, just get it--

10:13.404 --> 10:14.989
Oh, my God!

10:15.156 --> 10:18.034
Lordy, Lordy!
Have you ever seen such a sight?

10:19.243 --> 10:21.329
Joe! Joe, be careful, now.

10:21.495 --> 10:23.456
She might be all deranged from the heat.

10:23.539 --> 10:25.291
All right, big guy.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.419
Why don't you just move back over here?

10:29.086 --> 10:30.921
-Oh, we gotta get her outta here.
-(cow moos)

10:31.005 --> 10:33.799
Come on, pull her. Everybody back up.
Come on. Back up! Back up! Come on.

10:34.300 --> 10:37.053
Give us some air so we can get him
outta here. Come on, come on.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.972
You know, lady, there's zoning laws
against this sort of thing.

10:40.056 --> 10:43.684
Don't tell me, man! Tell him!

10:45.061 --> 10:49.774
-Okay, freeze, pal, right there!
-Don't shoot, mama! Don't shoot!

10:49.857 --> 10:50.858
Hold it!

10:51.817 --> 10:54.445
Hands up on the wall.
On the wall. Spread 'em!

10:55.738 --> 10:57.114
You believe this stuff, Joe?

10:57.740 --> 11:01.369
Oh! A regular traveling slaughterhouse!

11:01.452 --> 11:04.413
Hey, there's a brand on here
from Schiffman Brothers Meats.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.915
This is a hot cow.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.292
I never saw that animal before in my life!

11:08.376 --> 11:09.543
Look, you read him his rights.

11:09.627 --> 11:12.588
I'm gonna bring this animal
down to the unit and get a wagon.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.924
Yeah, right.
You have the right to remain silent.

11:15.007 --> 11:15.925
-(chuckling)
-What are you laughing at?

11:16.008 --> 11:17.218
You're under arrest, pal!

11:17.843 --> 11:21.555
That's right,
and you're up five flights of stairs.

11:21.972 --> 11:23.182
What is that supposed to mean?

11:23.265 --> 11:26.018
There's a lot of things in this world
you can get a cow to do.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.562
You can get a cow to drink beer
and sit on a brick.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.107
You can get a cow to chase dogs
with a bag over his head,

11:31.190 --> 11:33.275
even go up five flights of stairs.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.777
But there's one thing in this world

11:34.860 --> 11:37.697
you ain't never,
ever gonna get a cow to do.

11:37.780 --> 11:42.284
-And what is that?
-Go down five flights of stairs.

11:42.368 --> 11:46.706
Ain't in their nature.
Got no down genes! (laughing)

11:47.957 --> 11:49.542
(moos)

11:52.294 --> 11:54.714
MAN: This Board of Rights
in the matter of Louis Hogan,

11:54.797 --> 11:57.341
charged with six counts
of official misconduct,

11:57.425 --> 11:58.426
is once again in session.

11:59.135 --> 12:03.055
Captains MacPherson of Midtown,
Furillo of Hill Street

12:03.139 --> 12:05.683
and Fuchs of Special Narcotics presiding.

12:06.308 --> 12:08.519
Captain Hogan, just a few more questions.

12:10.020 --> 12:12.523
Are you continuing to maintain,
as you testified yesterday,

12:12.606 --> 12:14.942
that for almost a year
you had no knowledge

12:15.025 --> 12:16.986
of officers
of your Jefferson Heights Precinct

12:17.069 --> 12:21.115
using room 313 of the Downtowner Lodge
to coop,

12:21.657 --> 12:25.536
i.e., to sleep, play poker and engage
in sexual liaisons during working hours?

12:25.619 --> 12:26.620
Correct.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.998
Nor knowledge that certain vice officers

12:29.081 --> 12:31.083
were receiving sexual favors
from prostitutes?

12:31.167 --> 12:34.044
-Correct.
-Nor knowledge of drug disappearances

12:34.128 --> 12:37.465
from the precinct evidence bin,
nor police brutality complaints

12:37.548 --> 12:39.383
finding their way into the circular file?

12:39.467 --> 12:42.553
Correct. Not until you people
in Internal Affairs

12:42.636 --> 12:44.889
did your job and started uncovering it.

12:44.972 --> 12:47.683
Our job? What about your job, Captain?

12:48.267 --> 12:50.227
If I characterize
the Jefferson Heights Precinct

12:50.311 --> 12:52.646
during the last 11 months
as a precinct gone wild,

12:52.730 --> 12:57.151
a cowboy precinct, an open sewer,
could you honestly dispute me?

12:57.902 --> 13:00.571
Couldn't you smell it, Captain?
Were you without a nose as well as blind?

13:01.447 --> 13:05.075
I don't need any snot-nosed remarks
about my sensory apparatus, Lieutenant!

13:06.076 --> 13:09.413
I've earned four Medals of Merit
in 21 years on this force,

13:09.705 --> 13:13.876
-three citations for bravery--
-Lou, uh, please.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.507
If I could refer back
to a specific incident here,

13:19.590 --> 13:22.176
the record shows that on June 6,

13:22.802 --> 13:28.307
you received rumors that certain officers
were cooping at the Downtowner Lodge.

13:28.390 --> 13:29.892
What did you then do?

13:30.184 --> 13:32.770
I turned it all over
to one of my sergeants.

13:32.853 --> 13:34.063
Sgt. Williams, I believe.

13:34.396 --> 13:37.608
And were the officers involved referred
to you for disciplinary action?

13:38.192 --> 13:39.068
No.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.362
-Were they transferred?
-No.

13:42.363 --> 13:45.658
Were they referred to Internal Affairs
or demoted?

13:46.242 --> 13:47.159
No.

13:48.160 --> 13:52.122
Well, then, Lou, at some later date,
did you get back to Sgt. Williams

13:52.206 --> 13:54.500
to find out the disposition
of the situation?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.377
-No. Frank--
-FRANK: Lou.

13:57.503 --> 14:02.091
Then what made you think
that the situation had been taken care of?

14:02.383 --> 14:04.635
Look, come on, Frank! You're a captain!

14:05.302 --> 14:08.138
How can you run a precinct
without trusting the guys under you?

14:08.806 --> 14:12.351
They let me down. Is that my fault?
I didn't handpick them.

14:13.018 --> 14:15.062
Maybe they're dirty. I'm not!

14:21.569 --> 14:23.863
From what you've said here,
I can only conclude

14:23.946 --> 14:25.698
that you turned your back
on the whole situation.

14:27.324 --> 14:28.826
LAWYER: Is that a question, Captain?

14:29.201 --> 14:30.953
-If it is, I would--
-I was never dirty!

14:32.037 --> 14:34.790
I've been an honest cop
for 21 years, Frank.

14:39.253 --> 14:41.839
MacPHERSON: Frank, we've been
around this tree a half a dozen times!

14:41.922 --> 14:44.925
All you're accusing him
of is being a bad manager.

14:45.009 --> 14:48.137
All right. So he's too easygoing. Okay.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.638
But give him a decent bunch of guys

14:49.722 --> 14:52.141
in a soft spot like Farmingdale
and he'd do fine.

14:52.224 --> 14:54.310
-You know he would!
-He didn't get Farmingdale, Jerry,

14:54.393 --> 14:55.227
he got the Heights.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.187
-So? Luck of the draw.
-Hey!

14:57.271 --> 15:00.900
No one's claiming the man's
a General MacArthur here, hmm?

15:01.358 --> 15:02.943
Let me tell you something, Frank.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.613
If I were sitting in Lou Hogan's chair,
I'd be looking

15:05.696 --> 15:07.615
over to my peers
for the benefit of the doubt!

15:07.698 --> 15:09.116
I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt.

15:09.199 --> 15:10.409
The benefit of the doubt says

15:10.492 --> 15:13.370
if he misses one or two,
okay, but this record,

15:14.663 --> 15:16.665
11 street cops, seven detectives,

15:16.749 --> 15:19.835
one lieutenant and two sergeants
have all been disciplined.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.503
Jerry, you heard the testimony.

15:21.587 --> 15:22.796
With all that cooping business,

15:22.880 --> 15:24.798
he never once
checked back with his sergeant.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.467
Bottom line, he didn't know!

15:26.550 --> 15:28.385
He should've known!
It was his job to know!

15:28.469 --> 15:29.762
It's not enough to hang a guy!

15:29.845 --> 15:31.680
I'm not out to hang Lou!

15:31.764 --> 15:33.098
He and I go back years.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.183
But if we find him innocent,

15:34.266 --> 15:37.061
we validate everything
he's done or failed to do.

15:37.770 --> 15:41.190
(sighs) Gentlemen, can we vote, please?

15:41.690 --> 15:43.817
No. Just one more minute.

15:44.693 --> 15:47.905
We're all captains here.
We know how hard it is to be a captain.

15:48.238 --> 15:50.908
If we say that Lou Hogan's not responsible

15:50.991 --> 15:52.493
for all that mess over
at Jefferson Heights,

15:52.576 --> 15:53.786
whether he knew or not,

15:54.328 --> 15:55.996
we diminish the authority
of every one of us.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.208
Lou Hogan would win,
sort of, but you'd lose, Jerry,

15:59.291 --> 16:00.501
and I'd lose, and so would Roger.

16:01.126 --> 16:04.380
I'd lose? You speak for yourself, Frank.
I'm not the Blue Angel over here.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.423
-Oh, come on.
-Let's vote. Hey, let's vote!

16:06.507 --> 16:09.093
If you reject responsibility,
you'll lose authority.

16:09.176 --> 16:10.469
It's as simple as that.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.514
The whole department's waiting
for this decision.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.684
Are captains ultimately responsible
or aren't they?

16:16.767 --> 16:18.644
Are we worth a damn or not?

16:18.727 --> 16:22.648
Come on! It's 107 degrees in here.
Let's get it over with.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.650
-No, wait a minute.
-No. Come on, Jerry!

16:24.733 --> 16:26.694
Maybe we should talk
about this a little bit longer.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.863
You think we could send out
for some more iced tea?

16:31.323 --> 16:32.700
(MacPherson whispers) Iced tea!

16:36.829 --> 16:41.083
(chattering)

16:42.292 --> 16:43.711
The job is in the bag, Neal.

16:43.794 --> 16:46.130
I'm gonna charm
that interviewer's socks off.

16:46.672 --> 16:47.965
-What's her name?
-Fowler.

16:48.048 --> 16:51.135
Yeah, Fowler. Well, I'm gonna charm
Ms. Fowler's socks off.

16:51.218 --> 16:54.680
-I've never been good in interviews, man.
-Look at the bright side, huh?

16:55.222 --> 16:57.808
She gives me the job,
and then as director of resort security,

16:57.891 --> 16:59.727
I appoint you my right-hand man.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.770
I'm not sure it's the right move for me
right now, babe, anyway.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.897
(scoffs) Right move! Neal, my man.

17:03.981 --> 17:06.942
You are a 36-year-old ex-jock
with one bad knee,

17:07.026 --> 17:10.237
a third-rate set of wheels
and a dead-end career outlook.

17:10.320 --> 17:13.407
-You tell me.
-Thanks for the pep talk, boss!

17:13.490 --> 17:16.869
(siren blaring)

17:16.952 --> 17:19.455
The arrogance, 102 degrees!

17:19.538 --> 17:22.374
The heat is rippling off the pavement.
I'm moving my truck.

17:22.458 --> 17:26.086
I see an express bus behind me.
I pull over. I wave him by.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.297
The driver waits
until he's right next to me,

17:28.380 --> 17:31.967
then he floors it and gives me
a lethal dose of carbon monoxide.

17:32.342 --> 17:35.012
I had to eat two almond crunch bars
to get the taste out of my mouth.

17:35.095 --> 17:37.014
You're a very sensitive man, Henry.

17:37.097 --> 17:40.059
I'm going out there with a sign that says
"rob me." I gotta get off the street.

17:40.142 --> 17:43.395
-Toilet back up this morning, Belker?
-(growling)

17:43.479 --> 17:45.689
No wonder you people never had a homeland.

17:48.484 --> 17:52.488
Just the heat, sport.
Frays the old dendrons.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.782
The entire metropolis is on edge.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.909
Well, you look pretty collected,
Lieutenant.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.535
(chuckles)

17:58.619 --> 18:01.872
Zen and the art of interior maintenance,
Michael.

18:02.581 --> 18:07.336
It's a little Oriental number I picked up
in the Mekong during the Tet snafu of '69.

18:07.419 --> 18:12.007
Those bloody geeks had us cut off
from our S-routes for 28 days.

18:14.134 --> 18:18.013
Draw a little circle
in your cerebral cortex.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.057
HOWARD: You got it?

18:21.058 --> 18:26.980
Then you concentrate all of your pain
in that slowly diminishing circumference.

18:27.523 --> 18:30.651
Diminish, diminish,

18:31.401 --> 18:33.320
diminish, dissolve.

18:33.403 --> 18:35.405
It's all in the mind, guy.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.450
-Waitress!
-Yeah, honey?

18:38.534 --> 18:42.412
I distinctly ordered this Salisbury steak
medium rare.

18:42.496 --> 18:45.374
I certainly don't call this medium rare.

18:45.457 --> 18:48.001
Honey, you don't call
anything medium rare.

18:48.085 --> 18:52.381
Just look at this incinerated gruel!
It's patently well done!

18:52.840 --> 18:57.344
Uh-uh. Well done is black!
That's, uh, pinkish-gray.

19:01.265 --> 19:05.936
Keenly interested as I am
in the opinion of coffee shop help, madam,

19:06.270 --> 19:07.896
I must, nevertheless, insist

19:08.522 --> 19:13.485
that you exchange this brûlée grotesque
for one medium rare.

19:13.569 --> 19:17.614
In addition to which, you will henceforth
address me as Lieutenant.

19:17.906 --> 19:19.199
Forget it, honey.

19:21.285 --> 19:24.371
Take it back,
you impertinent scullery maid!

19:24.454 --> 19:27.082
-Take it back, I say!
-Don't you bark at me, buster!

19:27.374 --> 19:31.086
I've been serving you the same slop
five days a week for four years running,

19:31.170 --> 19:32.838
and the most you ever left me
was a quarter!

19:32.921 --> 19:35.132
Perhaps if you had
executed your job properly,

19:35.215 --> 19:37.342
-you would be compensated properly.
-(overlapping chatter)

19:37.426 --> 19:40.554
In Saudi Arabia,
you would be physically maimed

19:40.637 --> 19:42.181
for this sort of malfeasance!

19:42.264 --> 19:44.975
You don't get squat from me,
you two-bit Nazi!

19:45.184 --> 19:47.311
That's it! That is it!

19:47.686 --> 19:49.354
-Coley, arrest this woman!
-(scoffs)

19:50.564 --> 19:52.649
Lady, the lieutenant wants
a Salisbury steak,

19:52.733 --> 19:53.734
medium rare, that's all.

19:53.817 --> 19:57.112
You think you can get him a Salisbury
steak, medium rare? Keep the change.

19:57.196 --> 20:01.158
-Lieutenant, let's get a little fresh air.
-Judas Priest! Women's lib run amok!

20:01.658 --> 20:03.660
I assume,
after going through the literature,

20:03.744 --> 20:05.746
you're aware
of the scope of our operation?

20:05.829 --> 20:09.166
Mm-hmm. Two 18-hole golf courses,
tennis club,

20:09.249 --> 20:12.044
80-slip marina, condominiums, hotel,

20:12.127 --> 20:14.546
private beach facilities
and two restaurants.

20:14.630 --> 20:15.714
I'll tell you something,

20:15.797 --> 20:18.884
I decided, I don't get the job,
I'll just retire down there anyway.

20:20.093 --> 20:22.763
I must say, Detective LaRue,
these are most impressive credentials.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.682
Two Medals of Valor, I see.

20:26.892 --> 20:29.978
It's one of the more questionable
fringe benefits

20:30.062 --> 20:31.980
of stopping a bullet in the line of duty.

20:32.272 --> 20:34.733
The department's answer
to workmen's compensation.

20:35.108 --> 20:37.653
If you don't mind my asking,
is there any particular reason

20:37.736 --> 20:39.404
you'd like to leave your present position?

20:40.614 --> 20:45.285
(laughing) Excuse me,
but you're asking me why,

20:45.369 --> 20:48.538
after 12 years in one of the worst urban
wastelands in this country,

20:48.622 --> 20:51.291
I'd risk a substantial raise in salary
to work in the Bahamas?

20:51.375 --> 20:55.337
(laughing) Your point is well made.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.131
Oh, I'm afraid our time is about up.

21:04.554 --> 21:07.057
-How'd it go?
-It's in the bag, my man. In the bag.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.768
She thinks I'm the greatest thing
since air-conditioning.

21:10.852 --> 21:12.312
Neal Washington?

21:18.151 --> 21:20.988
-Do you have any suggestions?
-Uh, I--

21:21.071 --> 21:22.197
Hey, why don't you just shoot him up

21:22.281 --> 21:25.617
with some Nembutal and drag the dude down,
huh?

21:25.701 --> 21:30.580
Shoot him up? This is purebred,
grade-A kosher beef, you junkie!

21:31.206 --> 21:33.292
-(laughing)
-Hey, Bates!

21:35.127 --> 21:37.462
Brady downstairs tells us you got
a little problem up here.

21:37.546 --> 21:41.842
No, we got no problem. We're just loving
spending the day with this cow inside.

21:41.925 --> 21:44.094
Well, why don't you just
drag it down the stairs?

21:44.636 --> 21:48.807
Cows don't go down stairs.
Got no down genes.

21:49.182 --> 21:50.225
Bull!

21:51.143 --> 21:52.144
Come on.

21:54.771 --> 21:55.939
I said, come on.

21:56.982 --> 21:59.860
Come on, man. You better listen
to what I'm telling you, boy.

21:59.943 --> 22:02.070
You listen-- Whoa!

22:02.154 --> 22:04.489
I've had it, man! You're going down there!

22:04.573 --> 22:06.616
Get downstairs!

22:06.783 --> 22:09.077
Hey, look, seeing how the guy's gonna be
hamburger anyway,

22:09.161 --> 22:11.913
why don't you just butcher him up here
and then backpack him on out?

22:11.997 --> 22:15.208
For God's sake,
this is an $1,800 kosher animal!

22:15.292 --> 22:17.085
-(mooing)
-That is really cold, Bobby!

22:17.169 --> 22:19.171
-I got it!
-What?

22:19.629 --> 22:22.883
If this animal doesn't want to go down,
we'll take him up.

22:22.966 --> 22:24.384
-Up?
-Up! On the roof.

22:24.468 --> 22:28.388
I'll radio in for a copter,
we'll put a body harness around him

22:28.472 --> 22:29.931
and just lower him down to the street.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.684
-A helicopter.
-That's it.

22:35.562 --> 22:36.646
Yo!

22:38.148 --> 22:40.525
-What'll it be, gentlemen?
-Two fudge bombs.

22:40.901 --> 22:44.488
Two fudge bombs. Two fudge bombs.

22:44.571 --> 22:46.239
Two fudge bombs. All right.

22:47.699 --> 22:49.743
Could we, you know, pay you tomorrow?

22:50.410 --> 22:52.913
My uncle say he's gonna give me
five dollars tomorrow.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.249
Go on! Get outta here!

23:00.712 --> 23:01.755
Get 'em up, slick!

23:03.715 --> 23:04.966
Your wallet, too.

23:05.509 --> 23:08.345
I got no wallet. Just the change.
Just don't shoot.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.938
Freeze it! Police!

23:20.065 --> 23:21.775
-(screaming)
-You do anything, she bites it!

23:21.858 --> 23:22.984
She bites it!

23:26.822 --> 23:27.864
HENRY: Son?

23:30.200 --> 23:31.785
I'm a police officer, too.

23:32.661 --> 23:35.539
There's a lot of people around.
A lot of people could get hurt.

23:35.622 --> 23:39.126
So, just don't shoot.
Just don't shoot now.

23:40.168 --> 23:43.130
HENRY: Nobody wants to shoot.
Let's talk about this.

23:43.213 --> 23:47.551
How old are you, son? Son? You 16?

23:47.926 --> 23:50.637
If you're 16, you can still get youthful
offender treatment for this,

23:50.720 --> 23:52.305
but that's just for the robbery.

23:52.389 --> 23:54.307
More happens,
you're running the risk of escalating

23:54.391 --> 23:56.935
this sucker way, way past
anybody can help you, son.

23:59.396 --> 24:03.900
-So, how old are you? Okay.
-Fifteen.

24:05.318 --> 24:06.236
Now...

24:08.989 --> 24:10.574
you gonna let me help you on this?

24:12.409 --> 24:14.161
HENRY: You gonna let me be your lawyer?

24:15.537 --> 24:16.538
I'm telling you.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.250
Now, you lay that gun down now

24:22.252 --> 24:24.337
and leave the kid go,
kid didn't do anything.

24:25.422 --> 24:26.673
You do that,

24:28.175 --> 24:29.885
and we'll get you the best deal on YO.

24:32.262 --> 24:33.305
What do you say, son?

24:34.681 --> 24:38.018
Otherwise, there could be
a lot of people dead,

24:39.019 --> 24:40.729
and you're gonna be one of them, son.

24:50.447 --> 24:51.490
Just lay it.

24:54.201 --> 24:55.076
Come here, doll.

24:59.414 --> 25:00.582
Spread 'em!

25:03.084 --> 25:05.587
All right. All right.

25:07.547 --> 25:10.634
Okay, who wants a free ice cream?

25:13.345 --> 25:16.848
The panel will now announce its verdict
in the matter of Louis Hogan.

25:18.058 --> 25:19.226
(coughs)

25:20.936 --> 25:26.608
MacPHERSON: This Board of Rights,
with Captain MacPherson dissenting,

25:26.691 --> 25:28.735
finds as follows as to the charges

25:28.818 --> 25:31.696
of official misconduct
against Captain Hogan.

25:33.406 --> 25:36.868
As to the first count, guilty.

25:38.370 --> 25:41.331
As to the second count, guilty.

25:42.374 --> 25:45.335
As to the third count, guilty.

25:46.378 --> 25:49.214
As to the fourth count, guilty.
As to the fifth count, guilty.

25:49.297 --> 25:51.424
As to the sixth count, guilty.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.427
This hearing is recessed until Monday
morning at 9:30,

25:54.511 --> 25:57.931
at which time a hearing
of penalty will commence.

26:07.983 --> 26:10.819
REPORTER:<i> Back with our pregame show</i>
<i>after this live report.</i>

26:11.027 --> 26:13.780
<i>-This is Cynthia Cox.</i>
-Hey, look who's on TV!

26:15.323 --> 26:17.033
<i>...with a story that gives new meaning</i>

26:17.117 --> 26:20.036
<i>to that old police catch phrase</i>
<i>"domestic beef."</i>

26:20.120 --> 26:22.414
It's Renko!
Hey, it's Renko on the news flash.

26:22.497 --> 26:24.874
<i>...driving southbound on Central and--</i>

26:24.958 --> 26:27.877
<i>Well, Mr. Stephens?</i>
<i>Why don't you just tell us what happened?</i>

26:28.503 --> 26:31.881
<i>Well, uh, I was driving like that, see?</i>

26:31.965 --> 26:35.677
<i>And all of a sudden,</i>
<i>right out of the sky-- Damn!</i>

26:35.760 --> 26:39.639
<i>Officer Renko of Hill Street station,</i>
<i>maybe you could fill us in.</i>

26:39.723 --> 26:41.266
<i>Am I on? Ah.</i>

26:42.642 --> 26:46.438
<i>Well, uh, the subject was your basic</i>
<i>Hereford type cow.</i>

26:46.521 --> 26:48.773
<i>And he was up on the roof over there.</i>

26:49.107 --> 26:52.360
<i>And we were attempting to lift him off</i>
<i>with a police helicopter.</i>

26:52.444 --> 26:55.363
<i>And everything was going pretty good</i>
<i>until, all of a sudden,</i>

26:55.447 --> 26:58.241
<i>the copter just started</i>
<i>to kind of buck and sway,</i>

26:58.325 --> 27:00.744
<i>and then the cow started to mooing.</i>

27:00.827 --> 27:04.831
<i>And then, after that,</i>
<i>the harness just kinda snapped</i>

27:04.914 --> 27:07.250
<i>like some telephone wire</i>
<i>or something like that.</i>

27:07.334 --> 27:09.711
<i>The cow just started to fall,</i>
<i>and it was just mooing</i>

27:09.794 --> 27:12.505
<i>when he hit the hood</i>
<i>of Mr. Stephens's Buick over there,</i>

27:12.589 --> 27:14.382
<i>which veered away from the intersection</i>

27:14.466 --> 27:17.594
<i>in the direction of the Hard Rock Cafe</i>
<i>there, spun around three times.</i>

27:17.677 --> 27:20.430
<i>And I believe there's a great deal</i>
<i>of damage been done to that vehicle.</i>

27:20.513 --> 27:22.307
<i>And for that we apologize.</i>

27:22.390 --> 27:25.477
<i>The department does apologize</i>
<i>for that action on our part.</i>

27:25.560 --> 27:27.437
<i>-Thank you, Cynthia.</i>
<i>-That's it from here, Doug.</i>

27:27.520 --> 27:29.481
<i>-Now, back to you.</i>
-That's a lot of barbecue.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.942
You know, Renko handles himself pretty
well on camera.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.321
In the business, we call that presence.

27:41.451 --> 27:44.162
-Oh, yeah, sure. Sure. I understand.
-Thank you.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.624
Yeah. Thanks.

27:53.004 --> 27:56.174
-I don't believe it. I didn't get it.
-What?

27:56.257 --> 27:57.509
I didn't get the job.

27:58.134 --> 28:01.012
Hey, I'm real sorry, babe,
but I gotta tell you, man,

28:01.096 --> 28:02.514
I wasn't so hot
about the idea to begin with.

28:02.597 --> 28:05.016
What was she looking for, Melvin Purvis?

28:05.100 --> 28:08.395
I had every qualification.
She should've been grate--

28:09.104 --> 28:11.856
She should've been grateful that I took
time out to apply for the damn job!

28:11.940 --> 28:13.566
Washington, for you!

28:14.693 --> 28:15.944
Geez.

28:19.447 --> 28:20.323
Yeah?

28:23.576 --> 28:25.245
-Good work out there, Henry.
-Mm.

28:27.539 --> 28:28.748
You know, Frank,

28:29.999 --> 28:33.002
all day long kids would come up to me,
kids Josh's age.

28:33.461 --> 28:36.506
They'd ask to go a quarter light.
They'd go two or three on a cone.

28:37.757 --> 28:40.885
I mean, you know,
you just wish you could--

28:42.971 --> 28:44.806
It'd be nice
if they could afford ice cream.

28:49.436 --> 28:52.564
Mm-hmm. Yeah, thanks.

28:54.774 --> 28:57.360
-(sighs)
-Hey. Hey, hey. Come on.

28:57.444 --> 28:59.738
We're a couple of street cops, huh?
What do we know?

28:59.821 --> 29:01.322
She offered me the job, J.D.

29:02.031 --> 29:04.868
You got deputy? Hey, congratulations.
Come on, man. I mean it.

29:04.951 --> 29:06.494
No sour grapes from this end.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.913
-She offered me head of security.
-Hey, head of se--

29:10.457 --> 29:11.541
My job?

29:12.125 --> 29:13.960
She said I fit their job profile.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.172
Hey, hey. What's the difference, lover?

29:17.255 --> 29:20.008
I'll just bring you in as my deputy.
They say no, I won't take the job.

29:20.091 --> 29:23.553
No. No. No way! Not me.

29:24.721 --> 29:26.389
Can you see me as a deputy?

29:26.473 --> 29:30.143
I am a detective on a first-rate
metropolitan police force, pal.

29:30.226 --> 29:32.270
-I'm top dollar.
-Hey, wait a minute, brother!

29:32.353 --> 29:33.938
The job was good enough
for you to give to me,

29:34.022 --> 29:35.732
so how come it suddenly ain't
good enough for you, huh?

29:35.815 --> 29:38.526
It's not that way at all, Neal.
I mean, it's--

29:39.402 --> 29:42.822
-It wouldn't be right for me.
-Yeah! Gotcha, bro!

29:43.156 --> 29:45.408
Hey! Hey, you wait a minute now.

29:46.159 --> 29:48.953
Who was it, just a minute ago,
said he wasn't so hot on the idea?

29:49.037 --> 29:50.747
Now, all of a sudden,
you're bent outta shape

29:50.830 --> 29:53.500
'cause I don't think second banana's worth
leaving home for either?

29:53.583 --> 29:57.045
That's your damn problem, J.D.!
You don't think about a lot of things!

29:59.339 --> 30:01.132
(grunts, groans)

30:02.675 --> 30:04.594
Rough day on the stakeout, huh, Mick?

30:06.304 --> 30:08.306
No, Lieutenant, it was a piece of cake.

30:09.140 --> 30:12.477
The radiator on that stinking milk wagon
blew up on me,

30:12.560 --> 30:15.522
and I spent the whole afternoon banging
the engine block.

30:15.605 --> 30:18.608
You ever have an oil pan bust
on top of you, Lieutenant?

30:18.691 --> 30:20.860
-(phone rings)
-What?

30:23.404 --> 30:24.489
Hi, Ma.

30:26.950 --> 30:28.535
No, nothing's wrong.

30:29.494 --> 30:30.829
I'm fine, Ma.

30:31.913 --> 30:33.873
I'm fine, Ma!

30:35.708 --> 30:37.252
I can't talk to you right now, Ma.

30:37.335 --> 30:39.629
I'm in the middle of booking
a major murder suspect.

30:39.712 --> 30:41.214
I'm gonna have to call you back.

30:44.175 --> 30:45.343
What dinner?

30:47.637 --> 30:48.638
Tonight?

30:50.056 --> 30:54.060
Well, of course I remember
what day it is, Ma! It's--

30:58.356 --> 30:59.732
It's your birthday.

31:03.236 --> 31:05.864
Don't be silly, Ma.
How could I forget your birthday?

31:09.951 --> 31:12.036
Well, I love you the same amount, Ma.

31:13.746 --> 31:16.916
I'm gonna call you back later. Bye.

31:21.462 --> 31:22.589
(groans)

31:25.091 --> 31:28.094
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid,

31:28.177 --> 31:30.972
stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid,

31:31.055 --> 31:33.766
stupid, stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid, stupid,

31:33.850 --> 31:37.228
stupid, stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid, stupid,

31:37.312 --> 31:40.815
stupid, stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid, stupid.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.126
Excuse me, Miss Davenport.

32:01.878 --> 32:03.588
Could we-- Would you mind?

32:03.671 --> 32:05.924
-Yes, of course.
-Thank you very much.

32:13.222 --> 32:15.350
-I got a serious problem.
-Legal?

32:15.433 --> 32:18.645
No. I forgot
it's my mother's birthday today.

32:18.978 --> 32:22.565
I haven't gotten her a present yet,
and I'm supposed to be there at 6:30.

32:22.815 --> 32:24.943
I'm sure she'll understand if you give her
a present tomorrow.

32:25.026 --> 32:28.112
She won't understand, Miss Davenport.
You don't know my mother.

32:29.238 --> 32:31.324
-What did you have in mind?
-Suicide.

32:31.407 --> 32:32.325
(chuckles)

32:32.825 --> 32:36.037
I always get her jewelry.
It's like a tradition.

32:36.120 --> 32:39.123
But look,
all the jewelry stores are closed now.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.960
I thought maybe you could tell me
what I should get her.

32:42.043 --> 32:44.462
-How about some roses?
-No, she's allergic.

32:44.921 --> 32:47.715
-Candy.
-Oh! She'd kill me.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.550
She's got a small weight problem.

32:50.718 --> 32:51.636
(sighs)

32:53.846 --> 32:55.390
Do you think she'd like this?

32:56.015 --> 32:58.601
Sure, she'd like it. It's very gorgeous.

32:58.685 --> 33:01.854
Take it. I'll replace it
and give you the receipt.

33:01.938 --> 33:04.107
-No, I can't do that.
-Why not?

33:04.899 --> 33:06.776
I don't know. I just can't do that.

33:06.859 --> 33:09.487
Detective,
it'll be just like buying it yourself.

33:09.862 --> 33:12.407
You'll reimburse me
for the cost of the replacement.

33:13.866 --> 33:15.743
Really, it's fine.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.138
Oh! Oh, I don't know what to say.

33:35.221 --> 33:37.765
Don't... don't say anything.

33:37.849 --> 33:43.021
Miss Davenport,
you're as far from a dirtbag as they come.

33:43.730 --> 33:44.814
Thank you.

33:58.536 --> 34:00.204
Hello, Counselor. Hot enough for y--

34:02.040 --> 34:03.458
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

34:04.083 --> 34:05.501
I'm sure I'm fine.

34:06.794 --> 34:07.754
Frank?

34:09.964 --> 34:11.132
Do you, uh...

34:12.258 --> 34:16.304
Do you think these clothes
will be all right for the roast tonight?

34:16.971 --> 34:17.972
Sure.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.516
Because I won't have time
to go home and change.

34:22.351 --> 34:25.146
I'm going to go and wash my hands
for a little while.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.069
Frank!

34:32.320 --> 34:35.198
You really did it to me!
You hung me out in there!

34:35.531 --> 34:37.950
You gonna terminate me now?
You might as well.

34:38.242 --> 34:41.037
That three-month mandatory suspension's
the same thing as terminating me!

34:41.120 --> 34:43.915
Either way, you've destroyed my career.
Now, isn't that the truth?

34:43.998 --> 34:46.334
-Lou--
-You know it's the truth! I'm finished!

34:46.417 --> 34:49.253
Lou, I can't talk to you about this now.
I simply can't!

34:51.839 --> 34:52.882
(door closes)

35:00.306 --> 35:04.519
So I hustled into an alley, grabbed a hunk
of two-by-four out of a Dumpster.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.729
Then I waited for him
by the mouth of the alley.

35:06.813 --> 35:09.565
-So, I laid that two-by-four across his...
-J.D.!

35:09.649 --> 35:12.026
-What? Hm?
-Did you see who that was with the chief?

35:12.110 --> 35:14.654
-Jon Gennaro.
-Yeah?

35:15.238 --> 35:17.615
Hey, what's a movie star
doing up here in Slimeville?

35:19.242 --> 35:21.994
Frank, I want you to meet Jon Gennaro.

35:22.078 --> 35:26.290
Jon, Frank Furillo,
the best damned precinct captain I've got.

35:26.374 --> 35:28.126
-How are you?
-Captain, I appreciate your letting me

35:28.209 --> 35:29.085
come and hang out with your guys.

35:30.962 --> 35:34.340
-Hang out?
<i>-Street Dogs, </i>Frank. Jon's new film.

35:34.423 --> 35:36.175
Or is vehicle the word?

35:36.509 --> 35:39.762
Vehicles are movies the stars make.
I'm part of a team.

35:39.846 --> 35:43.724
Jon's team starts principal photography
here on the Hill in a few months, Frank.

35:43.808 --> 35:47.186
We've promised whatever logistical
and technical support he might need,

35:47.436 --> 35:50.815
but right now Jon wants to spend
some time learning the ropes.

35:50.898 --> 35:53.734
Right, but no special treatment.
I just want to take it all in.

35:54.694 --> 35:56.737
I thought we could send Jon
on some drive-alongs,

35:56.821 --> 36:00.199
maybe put him with plainclothes,
do a stakeout, whatever he wants.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.995
Excuse me. J.D.?

36:05.538 --> 36:08.624
(clears throat)
Detective LaRue, meet Jon G--

36:08.708 --> 36:10.251
Jon Gennaro.

36:11.544 --> 36:13.171
Hey, nice to meet you.

36:15.047 --> 36:18.050
J.D., would you mind showing Jon
around the precinct?

36:18.134 --> 36:19.635
He's going to be spending
a little time with us.

36:19.719 --> 36:21.596
Introduce him to people,
answer any questions he might have.

36:21.679 --> 36:25.641
Sure, sure, Captain. Come on, Jon.
You're gonna love this place.

36:26.267 --> 36:27.310
Thank you, Captain.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.360
-You're not serious.
-We have no choice, Frank.

36:36.444 --> 36:40.072
-This one's direct from the mayor.
-Oh, great.

36:40.990 --> 36:45.536
I'm supposed to babysit some movie star
who wants to play cops and robbers.

36:45.620 --> 36:46.787
Frank, what can I say?

36:46.871 --> 36:50.917
This is the first Hollywood production
this city has attracted in over a decade.

36:51.292 --> 36:55.463
That company's gonna dump something like
$5 million into this city's economy.

36:55.546 --> 36:57.465
An economy, I might add,

36:57.548 --> 37:00.676
which last year avoided bankruptcy
by a purple you-know-what.

37:02.261 --> 37:06.182
Cheer up, Frank! You'll be doing liaison
with Katy Bambridge.

37:06.891 --> 37:10.019
-What's a Katy Bambridge?
-Our film board representative.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.189
She's bright, she's young. A real comer.

37:13.689 --> 37:15.107
His Honor appointed her last month.

37:15.483 --> 37:18.194
She'll be in tomorrow to clear up
any questions you may have.

37:18.736 --> 37:19.862
In the meantime,

37:20.446 --> 37:23.699
I want you to make sure Gennaro
gets all the education he wants.

37:24.533 --> 37:25.910
Oh, and, Frank,

37:26.786 --> 37:30.248
let's make damn sure he doesn't get his
hair mussed.<i> Capisce?</i>

37:30.957 --> 37:34.627
-I want to swear out a warrant!
-I was just leaving. Ciao, Frank.

37:35.044 --> 37:36.712
Nice to see you again, Fay.

37:39.215 --> 37:41.509
The nerve of that disgusting filth!

37:41.592 --> 37:43.010
You listen to me, Fay!

37:43.094 --> 37:45.221
You can't just keep barging in
here every time--

37:45.304 --> 37:48.683
Well, excuse me, mister,
but I thought I had the same rights

37:48.766 --> 37:50.977
to police protection
as every other citizen!

37:54.105 --> 37:55.856
All right. I'm listening.
What's the problem?

37:55.940 --> 37:58.985
-My problem is George Bruckner!
-Your boss?

37:59.318 --> 38:01.153
Ex-boss. I quit!

38:01.821 --> 38:04.198
How could you just walk away
from such a good job?

38:04.282 --> 38:06.617
Well, I figured
I didn't have much of a choice

38:06.701 --> 38:08.494
when he called me into
his office and stood up

38:08.577 --> 38:11.706
behind his desk,
naked from the waist down!

38:13.624 --> 38:17.253
Did he touch you or assault you
or prevent you from leaving the office?

38:17.336 --> 38:19.255
-No!
-Then it's not police business.

38:19.338 --> 38:21.215
If you feel you've been sexually harassed,

38:21.299 --> 38:23.551
then file a complaint
with the Labor Relations Board.

38:23.634 --> 38:26.012
Well, thank you very much
for your support!

38:26.512 --> 38:29.515
Fay, I've had it up to here with you!

38:30.182 --> 38:32.393
I have a precinct
on the verge of meltdown,

38:32.476 --> 38:35.146
and you come blowing in here
with your two-bit problems.

38:35.229 --> 38:37.064
Today, it's some flasher.

38:37.773 --> 38:39.734
I'm working here, Fay.

38:39.817 --> 38:42.403
I wouldn't tolerate these disruptions
if we were still married.

38:42.486 --> 38:44.822
I'm sure as hell not gonna tolerate them
now that we're not!

38:44.905 --> 38:47.074
Well, I have noticed
that she's here every day,

38:47.158 --> 38:49.076
but then I suppose that's different!

38:49.160 --> 38:50.870
Yes, it is.

38:50.953 --> 38:52.580
She's here conducting legitimate business

38:52.663 --> 38:55.541
and she does not prevent me
from conducting mine!

38:58.252 --> 39:01.130
Fay, listen to me.

39:01.213 --> 39:04.050
I love you
and I'm concerned for your welfare,

39:04.633 --> 39:08.054
but I'm not your husband anymore
and I'm not your father.

39:08.763 --> 39:11.265
And I think it's time you took control
of your own life.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.643
You're right. I know it!

39:16.354 --> 39:18.856
But, Frank, I don't know how!

39:19.690 --> 39:22.109
My whole life is a mess, Frank.

39:22.651 --> 39:25.154
Do you think I enjoy coming up here
all the time?

39:25.237 --> 39:28.699
Don't you think I know what
I must look like to you?

39:29.116 --> 39:33.204
But I can't help it
because I'm scared, Frank.

39:34.246 --> 39:37.500
I don't know how to start putting it all
back together.

39:37.583 --> 39:40.795
I don't either. Maybe a shrink.

39:41.337 --> 39:43.130
Where am I gonna get the money for that?

39:43.798 --> 39:47.676
Fay, if you really want to turn things
around, I'm sure you'll find a way.

39:47.760 --> 39:50.221
You can do it, Fay. I know you can.

39:50.888 --> 39:51.889
Okay?

39:54.266 --> 39:55.518
Okay.

39:57.645 --> 39:58.896
I'm gonna leave now.

40:02.274 --> 40:04.402
Who knows when we'll see each other again?

40:06.153 --> 40:07.363
Oh, my purse.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.412
See you.

40:15.621 --> 40:16.705
Bye, Fay.

40:24.839 --> 40:27.925
As a medieval roaster would've put it,

40:28.008 --> 40:31.804
uh, and I might add, in medieval days,

40:31.887 --> 40:35.182
getting roasted could be
a very serious matter.

40:35.266 --> 40:38.436
-(scattered chuckling)
-If you take my thrust.

40:38.519 --> 40:40.896
-(rim shot)
-(clears throat)

40:40.980 --> 40:44.233
Or on a more contemporary vein, uh,

40:44.733 --> 40:45.860
Chief,

40:47.319 --> 40:51.157
commemorating your 25th anniversary
with the department,

40:51.532 --> 40:55.244
I can't help but recall
the memorable words

40:55.327 --> 40:57.955
of Lord Thomas Erskine

40:58.914 --> 41:02.460
regarding the fields of Waterloo.

41:08.591 --> 41:10.176
(snickering)

41:12.136 --> 41:14.054
Lord Er-- (laughing)

41:14.555 --> 41:16.223
Sorry.

41:16.807 --> 41:20.936
HOWARD: Uh, Lord-- (laughing)

41:24.440 --> 41:26.817
Uh-- (squeals)

41:31.238 --> 41:34.450
Just-- Oh, Judas. You read it.

41:34.533 --> 41:36.160
(laughter)

41:36.410 --> 41:40.831
Well, I'm sure whatever Lord Thomas said,
it was a real gut buster.

41:40.915 --> 41:42.208
(rim shot)

41:42.625 --> 41:45.294
Now, next up,
one of your own rank and file,

41:45.503 --> 41:48.589
a representative of the Hill,
your basic street cop.

41:48.672 --> 41:50.424
Let's hear it for Joe Coffey!

41:50.508 --> 41:53.511
-(applause)
-(band plays)

41:54.428 --> 41:56.096
(wolf whistle)

42:03.854 --> 42:04.980
You know...

42:05.898 --> 42:09.610
Uh... (clears throat)

42:19.537 --> 42:21.413
Uh...

42:23.290 --> 42:25.459
(audience chuckling)

42:32.883 --> 42:35.052
(chuckling)

42:39.890 --> 42:41.976
A couple years on the Hill
will do that to you.

42:42.059 --> 42:44.853
-(audience laughs)
-It's okay, Joe.

42:45.312 --> 42:48.107
Well, we're here tonight to pay tribute

42:48.190 --> 42:49.858
to the chief
of our Metropolitan Police Force,

42:49.942 --> 42:52.695
and I guess I know him
as well as any of you.

42:53.404 --> 42:56.824
Uh, what can I tell you
about old Spunky Daniels?

42:56.907 --> 42:58.492
(laughing)

42:59.326 --> 43:02.538
Rumor has it that, uh, he's pretty tight
with a dollar.

43:02.621 --> 43:06.208
Well, I'm here to tell you
that is categorically untrue.

43:06.792 --> 43:09.253
Why, just last month
he gave his lovely wife

43:09.336 --> 43:11.797
a necklace that used
to belong to a millionaire,

43:11.880 --> 43:14.883
-Woolworth.
-(laughing)

43:15.467 --> 43:18.053
As a family man, he is above reproach.

43:18.137 --> 43:22.099
His lovely wife, Ann,
can't forget the first time they ever met,

43:22.474 --> 43:23.642
but she's trying.

43:23.726 --> 43:26.729
-(rim shot)
-(laughing)

43:27.313 --> 43:30.858
Um, I'm not gonna bore you
with any long speeches.

43:30.941 --> 43:34.445
Uh, I'll leave that to our guest of honor,
Chief Daniels.

43:34.528 --> 43:37.239
-(band plays)
-(applause)

43:38.907 --> 43:41.577
MAN: That was great! Thank you, Captain.

43:41.660 --> 43:45.706
He could make a lot of big-name comedians
take a backseat, if he drove a cab.

43:46.081 --> 43:48.167
Anyway, speaking of the guest of honor--

43:48.250 --> 43:49.877
Excuse me. Excuse me.

43:51.879 --> 43:52.755
Hi.

43:53.756 --> 43:57.301
I'm Lou Hogan, Captain, Jefferson Heights.

43:57.718 --> 43:59.345
I'm not exactly on the agenda tonight,

43:59.428 --> 44:03.599
but I couldn't pass up the opportunity

44:04.433 --> 44:06.018
to be part of all this.

44:08.604 --> 44:10.939
Funny thing happened to me
on the way to the roast.

44:12.024 --> 44:16.111
My best friends shafted me
in a Board of Rights.

44:17.321 --> 44:20.282
I just want everybody
to know I understand.

44:20.866 --> 44:22.993
I guess I just stayed around too long.

44:24.828 --> 44:27.915
Funny. You want jokes.

44:28.290 --> 44:29.541
Jokes it'll be.

44:30.501 --> 44:33.504
How many cops does it take
to screw in a lightbulb?

44:34.630 --> 44:38.092
None. Cops aren't afraid of the dark.

44:38.175 --> 44:39.885
(light chuckling)

44:40.135 --> 44:42.596
Have you heard the one
about the priest and the mugger?

44:44.890 --> 44:45.933
Here's the best one.

44:46.266 --> 44:49.770
How many precinct captains
do you gotta sacrifice

44:50.020 --> 44:52.898
to clean up a dirty department's rep?

44:55.693 --> 44:56.694
One.

44:58.612 --> 45:00.280
And you're looking at him.

45:02.074 --> 45:05.744
Hell, you guys already knew that one.

45:08.372 --> 45:12.042
Mort Sanders, Preston Heights.
What do you say, buddy?

45:12.459 --> 45:15.921
Heard you had your house painted
last month courtesy of the department.

45:17.965 --> 45:19.633
Probably the same cops

45:20.300 --> 45:22.803
who drive your dad
to the track every Friday.

45:23.095 --> 45:26.390
Hey! But you're a hero.

45:28.100 --> 45:29.268
Bob Blaine,

45:29.977 --> 45:32.855
fire-eater from Richmond Avenue.

45:33.689 --> 45:36.734
Best-dressed vice cops in town over there.

45:37.192 --> 45:38.569
Condos at the shore.

45:40.821 --> 45:44.199
Frank Furillo, Hill Street.

45:45.284 --> 45:46.493
Mr. Clean.

45:47.619 --> 45:49.037
I suppose you don't know

45:50.205 --> 45:53.876
you got a detective who puts the squeeze

45:54.126 --> 45:56.086
to 15-year-old prostitutes,

45:57.254 --> 45:59.840
uniforms dealing in hot goods.

46:00.507 --> 46:01.759
Hey, get away from me!

46:06.013 --> 46:07.890
I'm gonna have my chance to talk.

46:10.684 --> 46:12.770
I think you're all
a great bunch of people.

46:13.562 --> 46:14.521
I do.

46:16.356 --> 46:19.651
I wish you all the happiness
and success in the world.

46:22.905 --> 46:25.741
But just let's remember
who made it all possible.

46:27.868 --> 46:29.286
Lou Hogan!

46:39.171 --> 46:41.131
How do you know he was telling the truth?

46:42.299 --> 46:44.051
He was right about Mort Sanders.

46:44.134 --> 46:46.512
The department painted
his house last month.

46:46.595 --> 46:47.763
A different kind of thing.

46:49.014 --> 46:52.434
Lou Hogan was drunk, Frank.
Bitter, hurt and drunk.

46:52.726 --> 46:56.313
Lou Hogan does not have the imagination
to say it was a 15-year-old

46:56.647 --> 46:58.357
if there weren't a 15-year-old.

46:58.440 --> 46:59.650
He has a name.

47:01.026 --> 47:04.613
You know, Captain Clean, you can't be
responsible for every teensy little thing

47:04.696 --> 47:05.823
that goes on in your precinct.

47:05.906 --> 47:10.160
Oh, no? That seems to be the territory
I staked out for myself today.

47:11.036 --> 47:12.329
I'll call him in the morning.

47:13.664 --> 47:16.250
-Will he talk to you?
-I'll make him talk to me.

47:19.670 --> 47:20.963
Ooh, that's cold!

47:21.380 --> 47:24.800
You know, you were the funniest flatfoot
at the roast.

47:24.883 --> 47:26.468
-(chuckling)
-Yeah?

47:26.552 --> 47:29.054
-Mm-hmm.
-But am I as good-looking as Jon Gennaro?

47:30.264 --> 47:33.058
-Who's Jon Gennaro?
-Oh, good. I didn't know either.

47:33.141 --> 47:35.978
Some movie star who's gonna be filming
up on the Hill.

47:36.854 --> 47:39.189
(sighs) We're getting older, pizza man.

47:39.273 --> 47:40.899
We don't even know who the movie stars
are anymore.

47:40.983 --> 47:44.570
-No, not older. Better.
-Mm.

47:44.945 --> 47:47.489
(phone rings)

47:49.241 --> 47:51.118
(groans) Hello?

47:52.703 --> 47:54.997
Mm. For you.

47:55.080 --> 47:56.248
(whispers) What is it?

47:57.291 --> 47:58.750
-Furillo.
-(giggling)

48:00.878 --> 48:01.795
Wait.

48:11.722 --> 48:12.598
Yeah.

48:15.309 --> 48:16.476
Thanks, Ray.

48:22.149 --> 48:23.066
What?

48:28.572 --> 48:31.074
Lou Hogan went home
and put a gun in his mouth.

48:33.869 --> 48:34.953
He's dead.

48:40.500 --> 48:43.503
(closing theme playing)
