CHRIS ROCK:
In my neighborhood, people
didn't make a lot of money,

00:05.339 --> 00:06.340
so in order to make ends meet,
people would gamble.

00:06.374 --> 00:08.376
And you know what?

00:08.409 --> 00:10.611
I bet you a dollar you can't
figure out which baby is yours.

00:10.644 --> 00:12.646
All right.

00:13.814 --> 00:15.516
I can't tell.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.485
Just about everybody
played the lottery...

00:17.518 --> 00:19.487
Those are tonight's
winning lotto numbers...
We won!

00:19.520 --> 00:21.089
We won?!

00:21.122 --> 00:22.490
I won.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.591
Get your ass
out of my house!

00:23.624 --> 00:24.858
MAN :
...New York lottery.

00:24.892 --> 00:28.129
Even people who told other
people not to gamble, gambled.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.131
Let me tell you this...

00:30.164 --> 00:32.500
gambling is a sin!

00:32.533 --> 00:34.202
With a capital...

00:34.235 --> 00:36.670
Bingo! Bingo!

00:36.704 --> 00:37.738
People would gamble
on anything.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.107
Bingo, bingo.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.541
I'll bet you a dollar
you can't guess

00:40.574 --> 00:41.809
how many cans
of tuna I got in here.

00:41.842 --> 00:42.743
Twelve.

00:42.776 --> 00:43.777
Damn!

00:43.811 --> 00:45.179
I bet you can't guess

00:45.213 --> 00:47.115
how many apples
I got in my hand.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.582
Five.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.218
Damn!

00:51.452 --> 00:53.821
The one thing everybody bet on
was sports.

00:53.854 --> 00:55.256
Whoo!
What?

00:55.289 --> 00:57.791
I'm about to make some money,
that's what.

00:57.825 --> 01:00.361
I got the Bulls
over the Bucks.

01:00.394 --> 01:03.097
I didn't gamble, but I knew
a bad bet when I saw it.

01:03.131 --> 01:04.198
The Bulls can't beat the Bucks.

01:04.232 --> 01:05.666
I mean, yeah,
they have Jordan,

01:05.699 --> 01:08.469
but Don Nelson can coach circles
around Kevin Loughery.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.271
The Bucks over the Bulls?

01:10.304 --> 01:11.539
You're crazy!

01:11.572 --> 01:14.342
Wanna bet?

01:46.907 --> 01:50.778
I wasn't making a bet with Doc,

01:50.811 --> 01:52.513
but it paid off, anyway...

01:52.546 --> 01:55.516
Well, ain't you
the little odds maker?

01:55.549 --> 01:57.518
What are you
talking about?

01:57.551 --> 01:59.387
Here.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.688
What's this for?

02:00.721 --> 02:02.756
You called that game just right.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.492
First I was down $50,

02:04.525 --> 02:05.926
now I'm up by $300.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.162
All I get is this?

02:08.196 --> 02:09.863
Now...

02:09.897 --> 02:11.732
When I said "bet",
I didn't mean "bet" bet.

02:11.765 --> 02:12.766
I was just saying.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.435
Oh, you keep on just saying,

02:14.468 --> 02:16.237
and I'll just keep
on paying.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.672
How'd you learn so much
about the game, anyway?

02:18.706 --> 02:21.675
Well, since I can't play,
I watch.

02:21.709 --> 02:22.843
I study the stats. It's fun.

02:22.876 --> 02:26.180
Too bad they don't have
an all-star game for stats.

02:26.214 --> 02:28.649
Now, what do you think

02:28.682 --> 02:31.352
about Jazz
against the Rockets?

02:31.385 --> 02:33.554
Well, everybody thinks
that Houston's gonna win

02:33.587 --> 02:34.755
because of the twin towers,

02:34.788 --> 02:36.824
but that's only for rebounds
and stick backs.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.859
The Jazz can run.

02:38.892 --> 02:43.297
Back at home,between Drew
and Tonya, all bets were off.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.200
Hah!

02:46.234 --> 02:48.536
He's up over the defensive
line, and king me!

02:49.237 --> 02:50.804
So that don't mean nothing.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.375
Hah!

02:54.408 --> 02:56.344
Bam! Bam! Bam!

02:56.377 --> 02:57.811
Hah! And that's it!

02:57.845 --> 03:00.914
Drew crushes Tonya again
and the crowd goes wild.

03:00.948 --> 03:03.551
:
I win, you lose.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.653
My brother was good
at everything except winning.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.721
Why don't you shut up?

03:07.755 --> 03:09.223
Why don't you make me shut up?

03:09.257 --> 03:10.691
Bet you don't win again.

03:10.724 --> 03:11.992
I bet you I do.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.527
Bet you you don't.

03:13.561 --> 03:16.530
All right then,
bet what?

03:18.266 --> 03:20.801
While Drew and Tanya were
putting their bets down,

03:20.834 --> 03:23.371
Vanessa was giving my mother
a heads up.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.538
Did you hear about Doc?

03:24.572 --> 03:26.006
No. What happened?

03:26.039 --> 03:29.243
He won $300 on the basketball
game last night.

03:29.277 --> 03:31.245
Gambling?

03:31.279 --> 03:32.713
I hate gambling.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.515
My mother hated gambling

03:34.548 --> 03:36.450
because my grandfather
loved it.

03:36.484 --> 03:37.985
He'd gamble on anything.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.320
Fights...

03:39.353 --> 03:40.521
Come on, blue.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.290
Let's go.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.291
Come on, blue.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.959
Doggonnit!

03:47.395 --> 03:48.862
He gambled on races...

03:52.566 --> 03:54.868
Doggonnit!

03:54.902 --> 03:56.437
He even bet on the weather.

03:56.470 --> 04:00.374
I got ten dollars on sunny
and 79.

04:00.408 --> 04:02.743
Doggonnit!

04:02.776 --> 04:04.278
Pay up...

04:04.312 --> 04:06.046
So you don't gamble at all?

04:06.079 --> 04:08.015
No! Not at all.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.850
What about Julius?

04:09.883 --> 04:12.019
Julius won't even bet you
his own name is Julius.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.622
The only bet my father would
place was this...

04:14.655 --> 04:16.724
I see your "20% off" coupon

04:16.757 --> 04:19.827
and raise you a
"buy one get one free" coupon.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.297
Too rich for my blood.

04:23.331 --> 04:24.932
Fold.

04:24.965 --> 04:29.036
I'll see your coupon
and raise you a boot.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.306
I'm out.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.808
Yeah, I tell you what,
I tell you what.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.910
Now, you loan me ten dollars,

04:36.944 --> 04:38.446
I'll put a little
somethin' somethin' down

04:38.479 --> 04:40.648
on the Houston-Utah game
for both of us tonight.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.516
Nobody in this house is
putting a little down

04:42.550 --> 04:43.851
on anything except
the bills.

04:43.884 --> 04:44.885
Told you.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.821
After a few days
of picking winners for Doc,

04:47.855 --> 04:49.690
it was starting to go
to my head.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.930
* If I ruled the world,
was king on the throne *

04:56.964 --> 04:58.599
* I'd make peace
in every culture *

04:58.632 --> 04:59.733
* Build the homeless a home

04:59.767 --> 05:01.602
* I'm not runnin' for Congress
or the President *

05:01.635 --> 05:04.538
* I'm just here to tell
the world how my story went *

05:04.572 --> 05:06.940
* As I arrived,
the crowd started to cheer *

05:06.974 --> 05:08.909
* And then someone yelled out,
"The King is here!" *

05:08.942 --> 05:11.512
* So I headed toward stage
to make a speech *

05:11.545 --> 05:14.648
* About the new style of living
I was gonna teach, uh-huh *

05:14.682 --> 05:16.550
* If I ruled the world *

05:16.584 --> 05:18.686
* Huh-huh, huh-huh,
uh-huh, uh-huh *

05:18.719 --> 05:21.489
* I'd love all the girls *

05:21.522 --> 05:25.459
* I love 'em, love 'em,
baby... *

05:25.493 --> 05:27.361
Good morning, Chris.

05:27.395 --> 05:28.796
Why don't you take
a day off, sweetheart.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.063
You bet.

05:30.097 --> 05:32.065
* If I ruled the world...

05:32.099 --> 05:33.467
Cool hat, man.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.003
Oh, thanks. It's a Kangol.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.471
Aren't those expensive?

05:37.505 --> 05:38.906
Yeah, well,
I made some extra money

05:38.939 --> 05:40.841
when I gave Doc a couple of tips
on the play-off games.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.142
Are you crazy?

05:42.175 --> 05:43.977
You've gotta give that back.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.045
It's gambling money.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.647
Do you know what happens
to gamblers?

05:46.680 --> 05:47.981
Greg, I'm not gambling.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.418
And Bobby Brown's drug free.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.985
I just told him
who I thought would win.

05:52.019 --> 05:52.853
Hello?

05:52.886 --> 05:53.887
That's gambling.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.889
Greg, calm down.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.057
What's your problem anyway?

05:57.090 --> 05:58.992
My mother.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.028
Was your mother a gambler?

06:01.061 --> 06:02.796
Yup.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.965
She lost a bet
and had to marry my father.

06:04.998 --> 06:07.968
Then she won another bet
and got to leave.

06:08.001 --> 06:08.936
And then there's
the bet she lost

06:08.969 --> 06:11.004
that got Greg here
in the first place.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.606
Back at Doc's,

06:12.640 --> 06:14.141
he was more concerned
with the line on the game

06:14.174 --> 06:15.843
than the line
at the cash register.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.945
But I think Dallas
is gonna take this one.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.913
You're going with Dallas
over Portland?

06:19.947 --> 06:21.482
You should be
committed, old man.

06:21.515 --> 06:22.716
You know what?
You both need

06:22.750 --> 06:23.784
to be committed.
Hey, Chris,

06:23.817 --> 06:25.018
what you think, man?
Well, who's

06:25.052 --> 06:26.687
he supposed to be,
Jimmy the Greek?

06:26.720 --> 06:28.656
No, that's Chrissy the Black.

06:28.689 --> 06:31.425
He called me that even before
he knew I could pick games.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.060
So, brother man,
what you know?

06:33.093 --> 06:35.663
Well, I know that the Portland
defense is way too weak

06:35.696 --> 06:37.631
in transition
to stop Aguirre and Blackman.

06:37.665 --> 06:38.866
Plus, the Mavericks have
something to prove

06:38.899 --> 06:40.501
so they're going
to come out hard.

06:40.534 --> 06:41.935
So I'm gonna have to go
with Dallas.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.937
And-and why should
I listen to you?

06:43.971 --> 06:45.873
Well, don't and lose your money.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.808
You know I got
a side bet

06:47.841 --> 06:49.076
with somebody as
dumb as you are.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.811
No, we gonna see
who's gonna lose some money.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.012
Well, bet me
double that.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.481
Win or lose,
I bet I'm in trouble.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.048
Put your money where
your mouth is.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.784
What is she doing
with us all the time...

07:03.991 --> 07:06.026
Well, well, well,
if it ain't Chrissy the Black.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.095
I thought we was supposed
to be friends, young blood.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.530
What are you talking about?

07:09.563 --> 07:11.732
Doc had a little side bet
on the Dallas game.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.066
I was the side bet.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.535
And I know you wouldn't listen

07:14.568 --> 07:17.170
'cause your name is
Risky, not Smarty.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.472
Wait, what happened?

07:18.506 --> 07:19.640
I lost,
that's what happened.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.241
If I had known you were giving
Doc his pitch,

07:21.274 --> 07:22.543
I wouldn't even bet him.

07:22.576 --> 07:23.911
For the first time I realized,

07:23.944 --> 07:25.846
that while Doc
was winning money,

07:25.879 --> 07:27.781
somebody was losing.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.016
What?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.183
You're in on this?

07:30.217 --> 07:31.118
He ain't in on nothing.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.721
I just give him a little
taste when I win.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.188
Well, if you're so
on the money, uh,

07:35.222 --> 07:36.590
how about tonight's game?

07:36.624 --> 07:37.858
Oh, that's a big game.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.960
There's gonna be a lot
of money on the line.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.995
Come on, man.

07:42.029 --> 07:44.064
Help me out just so
I can win my money back.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.500
All right,
just don't tell anybody.

07:46.534 --> 07:48.502
I won't tell anybody,
it's just between us.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.838
Translation:
"I'm telling everybody."

07:54.141 --> 07:55.843
You ever notice
how nervous you get

07:55.876 --> 07:58.512
when a big black car
is following you.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.155
You're Chris, right?

08:08.188 --> 08:09.590
Who are you?

08:09.623 --> 08:10.958
Shecky the Bookie.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.093
My friends call me
Shecky the Bookie.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.562
And what do you want?

08:14.595 --> 08:16.530
Word on the street is
you're pretty good

08:16.564 --> 08:17.998
at picking ball games.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.199
Nah, I'm just lucky.

08:19.232 --> 08:22.069
They build casinos
on your kind of luck.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.771
Look, your friend Doc,

08:23.804 --> 08:25.739
he needs to get unlucky.

08:25.773 --> 08:28.175
And he needs to get unlucky
tonight.

08:28.208 --> 08:31.612
And if he doesn't, I'm
gonna see you tomorrow.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.747
And you don't want
to see me tomorrow.

08:33.781 --> 08:35.215
I didn't want to see you today.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.617
Capiche?

08:36.650 --> 08:38.586
I wonder if that's Italian

08:38.619 --> 08:40.087
for "Did you just wet
your pants?"

08:40.120 --> 08:41.121
GREG:
Dude, this is bad.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.990
Tell me something
I don't know.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.292
The estimated weight of the
earth is six sextillion tons.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.227
Greg, that was a
rhetorical question.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.662
Sorry.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.163
I told you this
was going to happen.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.933
Chris, there's only
one way out.

08:52.966 --> 08:53.734
And what's that?

08:53.767 --> 08:55.135
We can disguise you
as a Dominican.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.571
You'll speak Spanish
and move to the Bronx.

08:57.605 --> 08:59.039
We'll call you
Salvador Armando

08:59.072 --> 09:01.274
Guillermo Sanchez
Garcia Morales.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.310
You'll never see
your family again,

09:03.343 --> 09:05.345
but you won't have
to pick any more games.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.882
Or I could just
pick the wrong team

09:08.916 --> 09:10.317
and everybody will think
I'm a loser again

09:10.350 --> 09:12.620
and then nobody will
ask me to pick anymore.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.789
You could try that, too.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.832
Baby, what are you doing?

09:25.899 --> 09:27.868
Trying to beat Drew
at checkers.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.703
Well, shouldn't he be playing?

09:29.737 --> 09:31.138
No.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.240
Because he bet me three dollars
that I couldn't beat him.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.909
So I can't play him again
till I think I can win.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.846
Baby, you know your mother
doesn't like gambling.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.114
Checkers is just supposed
to be for fun.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.150
It was fun.

09:43.183 --> 09:46.286
But every time Drew wins,
he starts teasing me,

09:46.319 --> 09:48.588
and I just want to beat him
until he cries!

09:50.023 --> 09:51.759
So, you know,
it could be fun again.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.061
Uh...

09:54.094 --> 09:55.663
Oh...

09:55.696 --> 09:58.365
I see why Drew
is beating you.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.100
Why?

10:00.133 --> 10:02.035
You've got to think
before you move.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.336
Strategize.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.972
Strategize?

10:05.005 --> 10:06.239
In checkers?

10:06.273 --> 10:08.742
You're not playing checkers,
you're playing Drew.

10:08.776 --> 10:10.110
It's like...

10:10.143 --> 10:11.979
you've played him
over a hundred times.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.213
You know all his
moves, right?

10:13.246 --> 10:15.716
Yeah, he just wants
to be kinged all the time.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.785
So what you do
is you leave him

10:17.818 --> 10:19.152
an easy way
to get kinged,

10:19.186 --> 10:21.221
but you're really leading
him into a trap

10:21.254 --> 10:22.923
to take all
his checkers.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.992
Just ask Paul McCartney's wife.

10:25.025 --> 10:27.227
Hmm, thanks, Dad.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.231
Uh, Daddy.
Hmm?

10:31.264 --> 10:32.800
Can I borrow three dollars?

10:32.833 --> 10:35.035
Borrow?

10:35.068 --> 10:37.805
Okay, "have."

10:41.875 --> 10:43.276
My man.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.745
How are you
at baseball?

10:44.778 --> 10:45.979
I don't know.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.748
Well, come on, come
on, we're on a roll.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.382
I didn't know when that roll
would end,

10:49.416 --> 10:52.019
but I imagined
how it would end.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.123
My man!

10:56.156 --> 10:57.224
Who are you?

10:59.292 --> 11:01.228
Wok

11:04.331 --> 11:05.933
Jail?

11:06.900 --> 11:08.201
I'm not working for you.

11:08.235 --> 11:09.136
Want to bet?

11:09.169 --> 11:11.972
I either had to stop Doc
from gambling

11:12.005 --> 11:13.741
or learn how to skin chickens.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.876
Oh, Chris.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.311
I was just about
to make that call.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.713
Lakers, right?

11:19.747 --> 11:21.181
Um, you know what?

11:21.214 --> 11:24.184
I've been thinking, and I think
you should go with Phoenix.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.186
Phoenix

11:26.219 --> 11:29.056
They just lost two games.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.323
Yeah, I know, but they're
at Phoenix.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.826
You know, it's a pride thing;
they don't want to get swept.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.161
You sure about that?

11:34.194 --> 11:35.929
Yep.
Nope.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.297
My man.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.166
I'm his man today,

11:39.199 --> 11:42.302
but tomorrow he's gonna beat me
like a bald-headed stepchild.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.377
While I was trying to get
out of gambling,

11:50.410 --> 11:52.345
my father
was looking to get in.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.886
VANESSA:
Hey, Julius!

11:58.919 --> 12:00.287
Hey. Vanessa.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.822
What are you doing over here?

12:01.855 --> 12:03.490
Uh, listen.

12:03.523 --> 12:06.193
Everybody in the
neighborhood's been
winning on the games.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.361
Are you sure about the
tips you've been getting?

12:08.395 --> 12:10.764
Sure as fried fish is greasy.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.866
Who's giving the tips, anyway?

12:12.900 --> 12:14.902
I don't know, but he's good.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.269
Doc hasn't lost a bet yet.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.807
Can you put this
on the game for me?

12:19.840 --> 12:20.808
Oh, okay.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.009
And don't tell Rochelle.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.844
Oh, no, wait a minute now;
I'm not comfortable with that.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.012
I can't lie to my friend.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.947
You told her
that perm looked good.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.249
Look, I'm not asking you to lie.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.985
I'm just saying... keep quiet.

12:32.019 --> 12:34.121
She'll keep it quiet,
just like Paul Revere.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.522
I'll tell her when I win.

12:35.555 --> 12:38.291
All right, now, you better
tell her, or I'll have to.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.393
Meanwhile,
back at my front door...

12:43.563 --> 12:44.998
Can I help you?

12:45.032 --> 12:47.300
Yeah. I'm looking
for Chrissy the Black.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.036
Chrissy the what?
The Black.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.403
Chrissy the Black.
Yeah.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.571
Who are you?
Who are you?

12:51.604 --> 12:54.307
You don't ask me who I am;
you're knocking on my door.

12:54.341 --> 12:55.909
You got a point.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.410
I'm Paulie the Bookie.
Paulie the what?

12:57.444 --> 12:59.079
The Bookie. Shecky the Bookie

12:59.112 --> 13:00.881
told me I can find
Chrissy the Black here.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.149
Chrissy the Black?
Yeah.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.917
You mean Chris?
Whatever.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.987
Who am I talking to?
Rochelley the Mom.

13:07.020 --> 13:10.123
Oh, the Mom. Oh.
I thought you were his old lady.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.292
Who are you calling old?
I didn't mean it like that.

13:12.325 --> 13:13.393
Look, what business
do you have with Chris?

13:13.426 --> 13:15.362
There's a lot of action
on the Phoenix game tonight,

13:15.395 --> 13:16.964
and your boy,
he's on a hot streak.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.365
Shecky's got good action

13:18.398 --> 13:20.600
coming on the over and under,
and I was hoping maybe

13:20.633 --> 13:23.336
if I can a heads-up
on the spread.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.038
Look here, Shecky...

13:25.072 --> 13:26.339
It's Paulie.
Paulie.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.108
Yeah.
I don't know
what you're talking about,

13:28.141 --> 13:30.343
but I'm done talking about it.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.281
Look, lady.

13:34.314 --> 13:37.350
It would be a lot easier
if I talk to Chrissy about this.

13:37.384 --> 13:40.087
I'm about to close this door,
and I suggest that your hand

13:40.120 --> 13:42.122
not be between it
and the wall when I do.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.024
And as for Chris,

13:44.057 --> 13:45.292
I hope you find him before I do,

13:45.325 --> 13:48.528
because his hot streak is about
to be over. Understand, Shecky?

13:49.529 --> 13:50.931
It's Paulie.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.299
Whatever.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.902
While I was nervous
about tonight's game,

13:54.935 --> 13:56.369
Tonya was nervous
about today's game.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.471
You got your money?
Yeah, you got yours?

13:58.505 --> 14:01.474
Yeah.
Okay, let's play.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.079
Hello, everybody,
I'm Jim Lampley.

14:06.113 --> 14:10.117
Today, we're in Bed-Stuy for the
World Checkers Championship,

14:10.150 --> 14:12.619
a showdown between Tonya
and Drew.

14:12.652 --> 14:15.989
In the past, Drew has routinely
schooled Tonya at checkers,

14:16.023 --> 14:18.391
but today,
Tonya is tremendously motivated,

14:18.425 --> 14:20.560
because three dollars
are on the line.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.996
The money's on the table.
Let's go to the action.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.333
Tonya is the first to move,

14:26.366 --> 14:28.601
making the play
for Drew's front pieces.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.240
That looks like it could have
been a setup by Tonya.

14:33.273 --> 14:37.444
Drew is gonna have to pay
for that move.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.479
Oh, there's a tremendous move
by Drew.

14:39.512 --> 14:42.115
Here comes Tonya again.

14:44.717 --> 14:48.121
All you can say to that move is,
"King me."

14:48.155 --> 14:49.990
Tonya's on the defensive again.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.926
That could be part of her plan--
and look at that!

14:52.960 --> 14:54.161
A double jump.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.295
Drew never saw it coming.

14:55.328 --> 14:58.631
Drew is holding on, but there's
every chance today...

14:58.665 --> 15:01.134
he's going to get beaten
by a girl.

15:01.168 --> 15:04.237
Ah. There's another
amazing move by Tonya.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.473
She's really got Drew
on the ropes now.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.642
One jump, two jumps--
what a move.

15:09.676 --> 15:11.211
That's unbelievable.

15:11.244 --> 15:15.248
Can Tonya come back now?

15:15.282 --> 15:17.017
:
Whoa!

15:17.050 --> 15:18.285
The impossible has happened.

15:18.318 --> 15:21.088
Tonya jumps all of Drew's
remaining checkers

15:21.121 --> 15:22.222
all at once.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.523
Tonya has won the game.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.530
I won! I won!

15:30.563 --> 15:32.565
:
You lost. I won. You lost.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.034
Now, give me
my three dollars.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.402
You cheated.
Did not.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.971
Did too.
No, I didn't.
What is going on in here?

15:38.005 --> 15:40.573
You two are screaming
like you don't have a mother.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.543
A dispute has broken out,
and under the rules of
the championships,

15:43.576 --> 15:44.978
Mom is here to settle it.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.646
Tonya cheated.
No, I didn't.

15:46.679 --> 15:49.582
I beat Drew in checkers, and now
he owes me three dollars.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.285
And you're gambling, too?!

15:52.319 --> 15:54.554
You ain't gonna be happy
until somebody comes over here

15:54.587 --> 15:57.257
and breaks every knuckle
in this family.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.027
So Tonya over Drew
in a checkers match to remember

16:00.060 --> 16:02.395
right here at the Palace
in Bed-Stuy.

16:02.429 --> 16:05.365
I'm Jim Lampley. Good night.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.503
I don't understand this.

16:10.537 --> 16:13.440
Why everybody in this house
knows how much I hate gambling,

16:13.473 --> 16:17.244
and yet everybody
in this house is gambling.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.679
Can somebody
explain this to me?

16:19.712 --> 16:22.515
Julius

16:22.549 --> 16:24.551
Drew

16:28.221 --> 16:29.289
Tonya.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.624
What do you have to say
for yourself, sweetheart?

16:31.658 --> 16:36.596
Drew was teasing me at checkers,
so I bet him so he would stop.

16:36.629 --> 16:39.632
Where did you get money
to place this bet?

16:39.666 --> 16:40.667
Daddy.

16:41.601 --> 16:45.138
Oh. Your daddy gave you money
to gamble.

16:45.172 --> 16:47.274
Isn't that sweet?

16:47.307 --> 16:49.309
Give it here.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.645
Julius.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.581
I was doing it just to
help her build confidence.

16:54.614 --> 16:57.584
Oh. You were building
your daughter's confidence

16:57.617 --> 16:59.652
by turning her brother
into a sucker.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.389
That's good.

17:02.422 --> 17:05.525
That's really good.

17:07.327 --> 17:10.430
And Chrissy the Black?

17:10.463 --> 17:12.499
You're just there
calling games

17:12.532 --> 17:14.467
like you're
in Atlantic City, huh?

17:14.501 --> 17:17.270
Is that what you want to do
if you grow up?

17:17.304 --> 17:19.106
Notice she said "if."

17:19.139 --> 17:20.107
But I wasn't gambling.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.241
:
You wasn't gambling.

17:21.274 --> 17:22.675
Well, I don't know
what they call it,

17:22.709 --> 17:25.112
Mr. Spread on the Over-Under,

17:25.145 --> 17:28.081
but you better get ready
to stop not gambling.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.617
"You better get ready
to stop not gambling?"

17:30.650 --> 17:33.453
The point is:
boy, you better stop!

17:33.486 --> 17:35.622
Well, I already
put a stop to it.

17:35.655 --> 17:38.491
I lied to Doc about who was
going to win tonight's game.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.693
Oh, so you're gambling
and you're lying?

17:40.727 --> 17:43.596
How long is it gonna be before
we have bodies under this house?

17:43.630 --> 17:46.266
Huh?!
You lied about who's
gonna win tonight's game?

17:46.299 --> 17:48.101
And what does that matter
to you?

17:49.136 --> 17:50.837
I placed a bet
on that game.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.339
You did?

17:52.372 --> 17:54.207
When did you place a bet?

17:54.241 --> 17:55.542
A little while ago.

17:55.575 --> 17:56.709
I gave it to Vanessa.

17:57.677 --> 18:00.780
So you went behind my back
to my friend?!

18:00.813 --> 18:02.449
She said
she didn't want to do it.

18:02.482 --> 18:03.450
I-I told her I'd tell you.

18:03.483 --> 18:05.385
Really

18:05.418 --> 18:07.620
Now?

18:07.654 --> 18:09.889
How much did you bet?

18:09.922 --> 18:11.724
Fifty.

18:11.758 --> 18:12.592
Fifty dollars?

18:15.595 --> 18:18.298
What happened to putting nothing
down but on bills

18:18.331 --> 18:20.233
Can't double your money
on the light bill.

18:21.701 --> 18:24.471
You're going to fix this.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.739
Oh, and you're going
to fix this now.

18:26.773 --> 18:27.740
How's he going to fix it?

18:27.774 --> 18:29.642
You can't change a bet
once you've placed it.

18:29.676 --> 18:30.743
I don't care.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.312
You're going to call Doc,

18:32.345 --> 18:33.780
and you're going
to tell him the truth.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.748
And you know what?
I'm going to change your name

18:35.782 --> 18:39.419
from Chrissy the Black
to Chrissy the Black and Blue.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.357
It's amazing how fast
bad news travels.

18:44.391 --> 18:48.161
Hey, Doc, it's Chris.

18:48.195 --> 18:50.497
What?!

18:50.530 --> 18:51.831
Danny, Lakers over Phoenix.

18:51.864 --> 18:52.765
Pull your bet.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.902
Julio, Lakers over
Phoenix-- pull your bet.

18:55.935 --> 18:58.938
Harry, no bet.
Don't bet the Lakers.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.340
Perez, pull your bet.

19:00.373 --> 19:01.641
Bobby...
Hey, man, pull your bet.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.710
Did you do it?
Tell him to pull his bet.

19:03.743 --> 19:04.744
Pull your bet, man.

19:04.777 --> 19:07.447
Reverend, yes. Pull your bet.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.216
Yeah. God bless you, too.

19:09.249 --> 19:12.519
After all was said and done,
I had won some money,

19:12.552 --> 19:16.256
lost some money, but there was
one thing I hadn't bet on...

19:16.289 --> 19:17.424
Oh, man!

19:17.457 --> 19:19.626
Phoenix wins!
Yeah, I won!

19:19.659 --> 19:20.693
My man!

19:20.727 --> 19:21.594
ROCHELLE:
We won!

19:21.628 --> 19:25.198
Yeah! I told you,
I put money on Phoenix.

19:26.433 --> 19:27.700
ROCHELLE:
Yes, we won!

19:27.734 --> 19:29.669
Baby, thank you
so much, Chris.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.608
This is great.

19:35.642 --> 19:38.911
Oh, she got the money,
got the money.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.780
Here's your money, Julius.
Yes, yes, yes!

19:40.813 --> 19:43.350
Ooh, thank you. Ooh.

19:43.383 --> 19:44.351
ROCHELLE:
This is great.

19:44.384 --> 19:45.552
Wait a minute.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.387
There's only $50.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.589
I know. I know.
I didn't make the bet.

19:49.622 --> 19:50.857
Just when I was about
to put your money down,

19:50.890 --> 19:53.860
Chrissy the Black said don't do
it-- Phoenix is going to lose.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.563
If it wasn't for him, we all
would have made some money.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.701
How was I supposed to know?

20:04.371 --> 20:05.772
You're Chrissy
the Black?

20:05.805 --> 20:08.007
ROCHELLE:
Yep, that's him.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.643
You see? You got people
thinking they're gonna win,

20:10.677 --> 20:11.778
when you know
they're gonna lose.

20:11.811 --> 20:14.347
If you'd let them lose,
they probably could have won.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.815
That's why I hate gambling!

20:15.848 --> 20:17.784
'Cause you can't win for losing!

20:17.817 --> 20:19.319
Here's the part where I lose.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.788
Now get your butt upstairs!

20:21.821 --> 20:23.690
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.893
