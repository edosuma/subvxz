12:35.537 --> 12:37.365
Yeah, we found
somewhere good to park,

12:37.408 --> 12:38.583
but apparently you have to be

12:38.627 --> 12:40.237
within 200 feet
of a public restroom

12:40.281 --> 12:42.022
or have an agreement
with a local business

12:42.065 --> 12:43.675
to let your customers
use theirs,

12:43.719 --> 12:44.938
which is ridiculous

12:44.981 --> 12:46.200
because who goes
to a food truck

12:46.243 --> 12:48.071
expecting to use
the restroom?

12:48.855 --> 12:50.682
Anyways, now we don't know
where to go.

12:50.726 --> 12:52.380
[Yuri grunting
in frustration]

12:52.423 --> 12:54.034
I have an idea.

12:54.077 --> 12:55.557
Why don't you guys
park the truck
in front of the studio?

12:55.600 --> 12:57.820
I mean, we get tons
of foot traffic here

12:57.864 --> 13:00.257
and you can say
you have an agreement
to use our restroom

13:00.301 --> 13:01.389
if anyone asks.

13:01.432 --> 13:03.521
Wait.
That would be amazing.

13:03.565 --> 13:04.653
You don't think
Yuri would mind?

13:08.918 --> 13:10.137
No. He won't even notice.

13:10.180 --> 13:11.355
You won't even know
we're there.

13:11.399 --> 13:13.401
No one has ever asked us
to use the restroom.

13:13.444 --> 13:14.228
Okay.

13:17.057 --> 13:19.189
You already have
your own distribution

13:19.233 --> 13:20.843
and online presence.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.192
So, yeah, you're
probably wondering--

13:22.236 --> 13:23.367
What we need you for?

13:25.848 --> 13:27.241
Exactly.

13:27.284 --> 13:29.547
I mean, duh,
you're huge!

13:30.418 --> 13:31.898
Literally.

13:31.941 --> 13:33.464
So, yeah, let's take a look
at your carbon footprint.

13:33.508 --> 13:35.423
Your company is contributing

13:35.466 --> 13:36.554
to global warming

13:36.598 --> 13:38.948
and the proliferation
of landfills.

13:42.038 --> 13:43.648
So apparently...

13:46.086 --> 13:48.262
Bulk Beauty
just landed Glow Fille.

13:50.438 --> 13:52.048
Oh, really?

13:53.310 --> 13:55.922
Don't you think it's odd
that your old partners

13:55.965 --> 13:58.446
are signing the same brands
we're targeting?

14:00.013 --> 14:03.625
No. Essentially,
our apps are identical.

14:03.668 --> 14:06.280
Logic dictates
that they would want
the same brands.

14:07.194 --> 14:08.673
So what
are we doing wrong?

14:10.980 --> 14:12.634
I don't know, Liza.

14:12.677 --> 14:15.289
Why don't you ask
our project manager?

14:16.899 --> 14:19.423
Oh, wait, that's you.

14:22.339 --> 14:23.863
You're right.

14:23.906 --> 14:26.474
Ultimately, I am the one
responsible for this team,

14:26.517 --> 14:29.738
and so far, your work
has been a big disappointment.

14:30.434 --> 14:32.001
You haven't set any pitches,

14:32.045 --> 14:34.177
and in the pitches
we have set,

14:34.221 --> 14:37.441
your contributions
have been less than stellar.

14:37.964 --> 14:40.401
So frankly,
if I don't see improvement,

14:40.444 --> 14:42.794
I just don't think this
is gonna work out after all.

14:51.368 --> 14:54.458
Wh-- What my partners
mean to say

14:54.502 --> 14:58.071
is that Marcienne
is an industry leader
in sustainability.

14:58.114 --> 15:01.030
Think of us
as your PR partners,

15:01.074 --> 15:03.511
reminding consumers
that you're never too big

15:03.554 --> 15:05.948
to care about
global warming and waste.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.342
And let us bring
more customers to Marcienne

15:08.385 --> 15:12.346
who might not be aware
that you are the beauty brand

15:12.389 --> 15:14.261
that sustains the test of time.

15:20.789 --> 15:21.921
I love it.

15:22.747 --> 15:24.924
-Let's do this.
-Fantastic!

15:30.103 --> 15:33.454
[line ringing]

15:35.021 --> 15:37.110
woman [over phone]:
Massage Wish.
How can I help you?

15:37.153 --> 15:39.634
Hi. Yeah, I was looking
to book a massage

15:39.677 --> 15:41.331
with Diana Graham.

15:41.375 --> 15:43.464
woman: Oh, Diana's
booked for the day.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.206
Is there another day
that we can get you in?

15:46.989 --> 15:48.773
Okay, when's
her last availability?

15:48.817 --> 15:52.168
woman:
Her last appointment is always
at 5:00 for 60 minutes.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.910
Um, she has a slot at that time
Wednesday afternoon.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.346
Okay, great.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.000
I'll call back when
I know my schedule. Thank you.

15:58.044 --> 15:58.958
woman:
Okay, bye.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.926
Pizza Pie,
hold the pig, add burrata.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.797
Isabella:
Uh, order for Amy.

16:12.841 --> 16:15.148
-Here. Thank you.
-There you go.

16:15.191 --> 16:17.367
-We are crushing it.
-I know.

16:17.411 --> 16:19.674
Hi. Welcome to The Toast Truck.
What can I get you?

16:21.415 --> 16:23.112
Yuri:
We should go on a retreat.

16:23.156 --> 16:25.985
Some of the greats, they did
their best work in isolation.

16:26.028 --> 16:26.986
You got Van Gogh,

16:27.029 --> 16:28.465
you got Munch,
you got Kahlo--

16:28.509 --> 16:29.858
They were all
sick at the time.

16:29.901 --> 16:32.426
And besides, there's no "we"
in isolation, Yuri.

16:32.469 --> 16:34.689
Yeah, but there is a "we"
in wine.

16:34.732 --> 16:35.820
Come on, have some.

16:35.864 --> 16:37.039
It'll make you
a hell of a lot more fun.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.867
-No, thank you.
-[loudly]: Have some!

16:39.824 --> 16:41.609
It would make me more fun.
Come on.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.876
-Fine.
-Good lad. Hmm.

16:50.574 --> 16:52.359
Hey. What-- what's up?

16:52.402 --> 16:54.274
I am so sorry.

16:54.317 --> 16:55.753
Who do we have here?

16:55.797 --> 16:58.321
Uh, this is Isabella.

16:59.322 --> 17:00.584
Oh, you are Isabella?

17:02.064 --> 17:04.719
Oh, you
are quite lovely.

17:05.894 --> 17:08.766
Thank you.
Um, this is my friend.

17:11.291 --> 17:12.596
-Elaine.
-Elaine.

17:13.771 --> 17:14.990
Um, and she needs

17:15.034 --> 17:16.557
to use the restroom
if that's okay.

17:16.600 --> 17:17.775
Absolutely.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.864
Any friend of yours
is a friend of my dunny.

17:21.388 --> 17:23.564
Restroom.
Door's right ahead.

17:25.827 --> 17:28.525
So, Isabella,
what brings you
and your friend,

17:28.569 --> 17:30.310
whose name you've
momentarily forgotten,

17:30.353 --> 17:31.746
to our little studio?

17:32.486 --> 17:35.837
Uh, just in the neighborhood.
Getting our steps in.

17:36.446 --> 17:39.362
Oh, that's good.
Good for the baby.

17:40.363 --> 17:41.408
Yeah.

17:42.496 --> 17:45.803
You've got that,
uh, pregnancy glow.

17:46.369 --> 17:48.328
My ex-wife, she had it.

17:48.371 --> 17:50.504
Creator of life.
Destroyer of mine.

17:52.462 --> 17:54.073
-Oh.
-Dennis: Hey!

17:54.116 --> 17:56.075
Oh, more visitors!

17:56.118 --> 17:58.903
Yeah, uh, this is
my friend, Dennis, and--

17:58.947 --> 18:01.689
-And my friend...
-Uh, Dan.

18:01.732 --> 18:03.560
-Dan.
-Hi.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.823
-Can Dan use your bathroom?
-Absolutely.

18:05.867 --> 18:08.565
But it's currently occupied
by, uh, Elaine.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.090
I can wait.
I think.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.961
Good. Door's just there.

18:15.485 --> 18:17.966
Seems to be
Visit-Your-Friend-at-Work Day.

18:19.489 --> 18:21.752
-Do you have somewhere--
-I should get back to work.

18:21.796 --> 18:23.493
Uh, what--
what about your friend?

18:23.537 --> 18:25.365
Oh, I can show him out.
He's my friend too.

18:25.408 --> 18:27.802
We're all--
We're all friends.

18:27.845 --> 18:29.673
-Cool place, man.
-Thanks.

18:29.717 --> 18:32.154
Nice to meet you.
Love your work.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.416
-Go.
-Okay.

18:40.336 --> 18:41.555
Okay, bye, girl!

18:42.686 --> 18:43.818
Call me.

18:46.299 --> 18:49.954
Um, okay, well,
I don't want to disrupt

18:49.998 --> 18:51.565
the creative process.

18:51.608 --> 18:53.654
Just wanted to say hi.

18:53.697 --> 18:55.395
Okay, just--
Uh, wait.

19:02.271 --> 19:04.230
-Do you mind?
-What?

19:04.273 --> 19:06.362
Oh! Um...

19:07.842 --> 19:09.060
[hesitantly]:
Sure?

19:10.540 --> 19:12.412
It's just
the wonder of life.

19:18.418 --> 19:19.593
You should get going.

19:19.636 --> 19:21.682
Okay, okay, yeah, yeah.
I'm-- I'm sorry.

19:25.294 --> 19:27.035
Might not wanna go in there
for a little while.

19:27.078 --> 19:29.994
Chili Toast
was pretty spicy.

19:36.610 --> 19:37.611
Sam.

19:37.654 --> 19:38.655
He's just--

19:38.699 --> 19:40.396
-Uh, Dan.
-Dan.

19:41.354 --> 19:42.398
Um, thank you.

19:42.442 --> 19:43.486
I'll see you at home.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.053
Hmm, yeah,
I'll see you.

19:45.096 --> 19:46.228
Okay.

19:53.104 --> 19:55.368
Yuri, I-- I can explain.

19:56.107 --> 19:57.108
What?

19:57.761 --> 19:59.198
I got an idea
for a painting.

20:00.155 --> 20:02.505
Woman with child.
Get the canvas.

20:05.247 --> 20:06.117
[cork pops]

20:06.161 --> 20:07.815
Ooh, another bottle?

20:07.858 --> 20:10.339
This is a big day for us.

20:10.383 --> 20:12.080
Marcienne is a huge brand.

20:12.123 --> 20:13.951
Ava:
Thanks to our MVP!

20:13.995 --> 20:16.302
We're gonna start
calling you "The Closer."

20:16.780 --> 20:19.218
Well, now that I know
what you can do,

20:19.261 --> 20:20.741
I expect you to keep it up.

20:21.481 --> 20:26.137
Well, here is to landing
more brands

20:26.181 --> 20:27.965
and more days like today.

20:29.010 --> 20:31.230
-Hear, hear!
-Ava: Absolutely!

20:31.795 --> 20:33.232
Raisa: We're so happy
you joined the team.

20:37.975 --> 20:39.325
Subtracting food costs,

20:39.368 --> 20:42.197
we are officially
ten dollars in the black!

20:42.241 --> 20:43.503
[groans]

20:43.546 --> 20:44.721
Hey, the way things
have been going lately,

20:44.765 --> 20:45.940
I'm gonna take that as a win.

20:47.507 --> 20:49.160
If you really wanted to win,
you'd reconsider my advice.

20:49.204 --> 20:50.814
All businesses lose money
at first.

20:50.858 --> 20:51.685
We're gonna be fine.

21:02.478 --> 21:04.263
I am so sorry.

21:04.306 --> 21:06.308
That is the first time
anyone has ever asked
to use the bathroom.

21:06.352 --> 21:07.657
It's-- It's okay.

21:07.701 --> 21:10.486
Yuri was none the wiser.
In fact, he got inspired.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.010
What does that mean?

21:13.054 --> 21:15.883
He's finally painting.
And that collector
is coming tomorrow.

21:17.406 --> 21:19.321
So you can't make
the appointment?

21:19.582 --> 21:22.106
Well, I-- I'm just afraid
if I leave,

21:22.150 --> 21:24.805
he'll lose momentum
and we really need the sale.

21:24.848 --> 21:26.328
I am a big girl.

21:26.372 --> 21:27.677
Okay, I'm more than capable

21:27.721 --> 21:29.418
of going to
a doctor appointment
by myself.

21:30.941 --> 21:33.509
-If you need me at all--
-I will text you.

21:34.118 --> 21:36.120
Don't worry,
it's not a big deal,
I promise.

21:37.034 --> 21:38.384
It won't happen again.

21:38.427 --> 21:39.385
Okay.

21:39.907 --> 21:41.517
Thank you
for understanding.

21:50.657 --> 21:53.050
-Dennis: Everything okay?
-Yeah. Yeah.

21:53.442 --> 21:56.663
I just, um, have
a doctor's appointment
for the baby,

21:56.706 --> 21:58.534
so I'm just going
to call a coche.

21:59.840 --> 22:00.928
Gael's not going?

22:02.408 --> 22:04.497
No, he has to stay
and work with Yuri.

22:05.889 --> 22:07.326
It's okay, though.
I'm okay.

22:09.153 --> 22:09.937
It's just--

22:11.199 --> 22:12.896
Ever since that scare,
I'm just-- I'm so scared

22:12.940 --> 22:15.725
the doctor is gonna
give me some horrible news
or something, so.

22:19.512 --> 22:20.513
Why don't I take you?

22:23.820 --> 22:25.344
-Are you sure?
-Of course.

22:25.387 --> 22:27.520
Truck's not doing
any more business today.

22:27.563 --> 22:29.086
I'll be happy
to do it.

22:31.175 --> 22:34.353
Thank you.
I'd really appreciate that.

22:35.136 --> 22:36.050
You are my angel.

22:44.406 --> 22:46.713
Diana! Hey, Diana.

22:49.542 --> 22:50.499
Thought that was you.

22:50.543 --> 22:52.414
-How's it going?
-Fine.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.155
I'm sorry, do we know
each other?

22:54.198 --> 22:56.505
Yeah, from The Coterie.
I'm Kelly's friend.

22:56.549 --> 22:58.551
Remember we met
at the party?

22:59.334 --> 23:00.553
Ehh, it's been a while.

23:00.814 --> 23:02.642
Sorry,
I don't remember you.

23:02.990 --> 23:04.774
But you used
to live there, right?

23:04.818 --> 23:06.733
No, I think you have me
confused with someone else.

23:06.776 --> 23:09.257
You know what?
It probably wasn't called
The Coterie back then.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.607
It's the communal living place
above the Palace Theater.

23:11.651 --> 23:13.174
Look, I already told you
I don't know what
you're talking about.

23:13.217 --> 23:14.044
I need to go.

23:15.481 --> 23:16.046
Yeah, well,
you knew Jenna Perez,
didn't you?

23:17.874 --> 23:20.747
Look, I don't know who you are
or what you want.

23:20.790 --> 23:23.053
Don't come
to my place of work again
or I'll call security.

23:27.144 --> 23:31.975
So what's up with your friend,
Dennis, and Isabella?

23:33.586 --> 23:35.414
Nothing.
They work together.

23:35.457 --> 23:36.676
Really?

23:38.329 --> 23:39.592
Well, I'd keep an eye
on them if I were you.
More white.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.464
-What do you mean?
-Well, the reason

23:42.508 --> 23:43.987
my daughter
doesn't want to visit me

23:44.031 --> 23:47.121
is because
her mother's new boyfriend,
