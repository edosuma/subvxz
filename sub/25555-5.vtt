23:13.258 --> 23:14.459
{\an3}Why?

23:14.526 --> 23:16.762

And you know what?

23:18.663 --> 23:20.132
{\an1}Right now, I just, like,
can't talk to him.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.440

to communicate."

23:28.507 --> 23:29.908

what a relationship is,

23:29.975 --> 23:31.176
is communication.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.611
{\an8}It's so stupid
that Logan's sitting here

23:32.677 --> 23:33.879

deserve that.

you know,

23:37.816 --> 23:39.184
you guys just need
to communicate

23:39.251 --> 23:41.119
because a relationship
is all about communication.

23:41.186 --> 23:43.755
If you hold things in
and get upset,

23:43.822 --> 23:45.590

{\an8}Last summer, me and Codi did
a lot of things together.

37:35.519 --> 37:36.954
{\an8}We spent a lot of time together.

37:37.021 --> 37:38.689
{\an8}He's, like, my best friend.

37:38.756 --> 37:41.459
So it really hurts my feelings
that he used me.

37:41.525 --> 37:44.362
I thought me and Codi
were closer than that.

37:44.428 --> 37:46.597
(tearfully)
Why would Codi say that?

37:46.664 --> 37:47.765
Everybody already knows

37:47.832 --> 37:50.334
I feel like (bleep)
about myself.

37:50.401 --> 37:52.136
I thought he was my best
guy friend though.

37:52.203 --> 37:54.839
I thought that too.
I thought you were buds.

37:54.905 --> 37:59.076
{\an5}(Aimee)
That's so (bleep) wrong
on so many levels.

37:59.143 --> 38:01.012
{\an5}(Nilsa)
Candace is already pissed off,
Aimee's upset,

38:01.078 --> 38:02.847
and everyone's been drinking.

38:02.913 --> 38:04.248
(bleep)'s about to hit the fan.

38:12.923 --> 38:14.625
(Aimee, tearfully)
Codi saying that

38:14.692 --> 38:16.994
just really makes me feel
like I'm not (bleep).

38:17.061 --> 38:19.096
Aimee, don't cry.
Please don't cry.

38:19.163 --> 38:20.798
Yeah, Aimee, please,
'cause it's gonna be okay.

38:20.865 --> 38:22.333
I mean, I was sad before.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.834
That's so (bleep).

38:23.901 --> 38:27.438
{\an5}(Aimee)
On the way home,
Candace tells me

38:27.505 --> 38:31.108
that Codi said that he uses me
to make her jealous,

38:31.175 --> 38:33.477
{\an8}and that pisses me
the (bleep) off.

38:33.544 --> 38:34.945
{\an8}I'm like, "Really?

38:35.012 --> 38:36.981
"You used me to make
somebody else jealous?

38:37.048 --> 38:38.282
"I'm your friend.

38:38.349 --> 38:40.151
You shouldn't use me
for (bleep) like that."

38:44.789 --> 38:45.890
(Aimee sniffling)

38:45.956 --> 38:47.892
{\an1}Aimee...

38:47.958 --> 38:49.694
{\an1}I think you need to go in there
and apologize to Aimee

38:49.760 --> 38:50.961
is what I think you need to do.

38:51.028 --> 38:52.596
{\an5}Who, me?

38:51.028 --> 38:52.596
{\an1}Yes.

38:52.663 --> 38:53.798
I didn't do anything wrong.

38:53.864 --> 38:56.200
{\an5}Hey, Aimee.

38:53.864 --> 38:56.200
{\an3}(sobbing)

38:56.267 --> 38:57.768
(Kortni)
I don't know what happened,

38:57.835 --> 39:01.472
{\an8}but I can already tell it was
a good decision to stay in.

39:01.539 --> 39:06.577
{\an1}You told Candace that you were
stuck up Aimee's ass

39:06.644 --> 39:09.013
all of last summer
just to make her jealous,

39:09.080 --> 39:10.214
and that made Aimee feel like

39:10.281 --> 39:11.949
she was an object
and not a friend.

39:12.016 --> 39:13.551
I never said that (bleep).

39:13.617 --> 39:15.386
{\an4}That never came
out of my (bleep) mouth.

39:13.617 --> 39:15.386
Then ask her.

39:15.453 --> 39:17.388
When-- every time Aimee
asked you to do (bleep),

39:17.455 --> 39:18.622
you run to her.

39:18.689 --> 39:19.924
{\an5}You know why I do that?

39:18.689 --> 39:19.924
{\an3}Uh-uh.

39:19.990 --> 39:22.259
{\an1}Because I want
to make you feel jealous.

39:22.326 --> 39:24.462
{\an1}I want you to come
and pursue me.

39:24.528 --> 39:26.263
Don't yell at me, Codi.

39:26.330 --> 39:28.232
{\an5}I am your friend.

39:26.330 --> 39:28.232
{\an1}I'm not yelling at you,
but I'm just saying,

39:28.299 --> 39:30.267
{\an4}I've never (bleep) said
that (bleep).

39:28.299 --> 39:30.267
Then ask her.

39:30.334 --> 39:32.002
I don't (bleep) know.
Like...

39:32.069 --> 39:33.504
{\an5}(Codi)
I don't know
where this is coming from,

39:33.571 --> 39:35.005
but I was with Kirk
the whole time.

39:35.072 --> 39:36.307
{\an8}Like, what... you know?

39:36.373 --> 39:37.908
{\an8}What are you talking about?

39:37.975 --> 39:43.314
Codi said that he just used me
last year to make Candace mad.

39:43.380 --> 39:44.548
I didn't do nothing wrong.

39:44.615 --> 39:46.383
{\an5}I never did anything wrong.

39:44.615 --> 39:46.383
Shh, shh, shh.

39:46.450 --> 39:48.552
Just tell her you're sorry.

39:48.619 --> 39:50.521
I didn't do anything wrong.

39:50.588 --> 39:51.622
(Aimee)
Why would you say that?

39:51.689 --> 39:53.891
Aimee, I didn't
say anything.

39:53.958 --> 39:55.459
What-- this is (bleep)
bull(bleep).

39:55.526 --> 39:57.328
{\an5}I didn't do nothin'.

39:55.526 --> 39:57.328
Why the (bleep) y'all lie?

39:57.394 --> 39:58.963
I didn't do
anything wrong.

39:59.029 --> 40:02.700
{\an1}Codi, you claimed, oh,
you have this thing for me,

40:02.767 --> 40:07.238
{\an1}but last summer you've always
been up Aimee's (bleep),

40:07.304 --> 40:08.606
and you tell me that,

40:08.672 --> 40:11.475
{\an1}"Oh, well, I'm using this
whole thing with other girls

40:11.542 --> 40:12.810
to make you jealous."

40:12.877 --> 40:14.678
{\an4}Okay?

40:12.877 --> 40:14.678
I said that
to the extent that...

40:14.745 --> 40:16.747
I said that to...
didn't apply

40:16.814 --> 40:18.549
to any of the roommates
in this house.

40:18.616 --> 40:21.485
I never said I hit on Aimee
to make Candace jealous.

40:21.552 --> 40:23.921
I mean, if anything,
I tried to hit on other girls

40:23.988 --> 40:25.623
that's not in this house
to make Candace jealous.

40:25.689 --> 40:27.057
(chuckles)

40:27.124 --> 40:28.325
I'm gonna be honest with you.

40:28.392 --> 40:31.228
I went out there looking
for a bad-ass black girl

40:31.295 --> 40:32.530
to make you (bleep) jealous.

40:32.596 --> 40:35.766
{\an5}I did that.
I wanted you to know
how I felt

40:35.833 --> 40:38.102
because you think
I'm fake as (bleep)

40:38.169 --> 40:40.871
{\an5}and you think I'm
on this bull(bleep).

40:38.169 --> 40:40.871
I know you are.

40:40.938 --> 40:42.406
{\an4}Ooh, okay.

40:40.938 --> 40:42.406
I know you are.

40:42.473 --> 40:43.841
Whatever.
You know what?

40:43.908 --> 40:45.509
You know
what the problem is?

40:45.576 --> 40:46.811
You don't know a good guy

40:46.877 --> 40:48.646
if he (bleep) walked
in front of your face.

40:48.712 --> 40:50.414
{\an4}Codi, that's not true,
'cause every time--

40:48.712 --> 40:50.414
Because you know what?

40:50.481 --> 40:52.416
You and Gator Jay
won't (bleep) work out--

40:52.483 --> 40:53.984

40:54.051 --> 40:55.419
you're gonna pick up
the phone and call?

40:55.486 --> 40:57.655
You're gonna (bleep) call
Codi, and you know what?

I'ma say, "Uh, nah."
Mm-- click!

41:00.958 --> 41:02.560
I'm not giving you
the time or place.

41:02.626 --> 41:03.828
{\an1}Codi,
I would never call you,
