00:12.354 --> 00:14.693
When Columbus discovered America,

00:14.761 --> 00:19.456
a series of mysteries arose to
confound the scholars of Europe.

00:19.684 --> 00:23.784
Here, are two continents,
completely isolated from each other.

00:23.878 --> 00:27.833
Yet they simultaneously
developed similar cultures.

00:28.228 --> 00:29.278
For example;

00:29.431 --> 00:34.712
The Mayans measured time, on the same
principle as the Gregorian calendar of Europe.

00:34.913 --> 00:37.495
They used the same signs of the zodiac.

00:37.594 --> 00:40.965
The same decimal, and mathematical system.

00:41.191 --> 00:43.020
They valued silver and gold.

00:43.110 --> 00:45.730
Using both for jewelry and barter.

00:46.095 --> 00:48.285
Another mystery was the banana plant.

00:48.385 --> 00:51.840
A native of Asia,
that cannot be grown from seed.

00:51.995 --> 00:56.162
Yet, Columbus found it thriving,
in the New World.

00:56.487 --> 00:59.959
Elephants at that time,
did not exist in the Americas.

01:00.082 --> 01:05.715
Yet there likenesses were cleaved on
the walls of prehistoric caves in Peru.

01:06.160 --> 01:12.340
The pyramids in Mexico, and in Egypt,
were built on identical architectural principles...

01:12.614 --> 01:16.081
Then there was a striking resemblance
of a witch of Spain...

01:16.246 --> 01:19.542
...and the witch
depicted in the New World.

01:19.797 --> 01:21.997
But the most significant of all...

01:22.091 --> 01:27.240
Mayan, and Aztec legends, shared with Greek,
and Hebrew and Assyrian literature...

01:27.336 --> 01:29.802
... an account of a terrible deluge.

01:30.079 --> 01:32.923
A deluge, many believe, had destroyed the link.

01:32.978 --> 01:34.389
The mother empire...

01:34.478 --> 01:38.889
...that had spread her civilization,
to both sides of the Atlantic.

01:39.391 --> 01:42.836
The Greek scholar Plato,
recorded this theory first,

01:42.918 --> 01:45.836
over two thousand years ago.

01:46.769 --> 01:50.109
There was once, another continent.

03:17.029 --> 03:18.841
I have a bite.

03:19.538 --> 03:21.645
Look father, there.

03:25.182 --> 03:27.251
Damn.

03:28.460 --> 03:29.563
What?

03:37.676 --> 03:40.227
Come back.
Demitrius, come back.

03:40.253 --> 03:42.616
It's a trickery of sirens.

04:19.059 --> 04:22.786
Be careful, don't touch her.

04:35.774 --> 04:41.090
By the trident of Neptune.
A mermaid.

04:42.357 --> 04:43.755
The flask.

05:02.347 --> 05:03.812
Who are you?

05:07.672 --> 05:10.673
Who can she be?
She's not one of our people.

05:10.699 --> 05:16.820
I don't know, but no fisherman of our village,
ever came home with the catch like this?

05:50.787 --> 05:52.599
Father.

05:53.742 --> 05:58.025
Where is this miserable hovel,
and why do I wear the garb of slaves?

05:58.188 --> 06:01.283
You are in Greece, this is our home.

06:02.736 --> 06:04.760
The robe is mine.

06:06.173 --> 06:07.973
You dressed me?

06:08.727 --> 06:10.621
Someone had to.

06:11.144 --> 06:14.880
Where are my robes?
This cloth offends my skin.

06:15.050 --> 06:17.950
they were wet, I hung them to dry.

06:18.165 --> 06:20.755
Our fare is simple, come.

06:20.920 --> 06:23.948
Break bread with us, and tell us your story.

06:24.910 --> 06:26.917
Your food tempts me not.

06:27.035 --> 06:29.838
As you wish, my little mermaid.

06:30.199 --> 06:32.306
I am not your little mermaid!

06:32.460 --> 06:34.173
I'm a Princess.

06:34.436 --> 06:35.868
Princess?

06:36.267 --> 06:39.604
Princess Antillia,
the daughter of King Kronos.

06:40.795 --> 06:44.705
And where,
is this kingdom of yours, Princess?

06:45.045 --> 06:47.681
In the great sea, beyond
the Pillars of Hercules.

06:47.787 --> 06:50.041
Pillars of Hercules!

06:52.730 --> 06:56.239
There is nothing beyond.
The world ends there.

06:56.349 --> 06:59.028
You doubt my word, fisherman?

06:59.188 --> 07:00.990
Have you ever been, beyond them?

07:01.043 --> 07:03.481
Had we, we wouldn't be here.

07:07.517 --> 07:09.048
Do not touch me!

07:09.178 --> 07:10.681
You smell of fish.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.259
We should...

07:12.738 --> 07:14.947
We are fishermen.

07:16.105 --> 07:19.946
Now listen.
And listen well, Princess.

07:20.133 --> 07:22.668
In our land, we have no Kings...

07:22.772 --> 07:24.587
No Kings daughters,

07:24.691 --> 07:26.074
no slaves.

07:26.144 --> 07:27.953
We are all free men.

07:28.047 --> 07:31.467
Treating one another,
as we would be treated ourselves.

07:31.493 --> 07:34.140
My son and I,
rescued you from the sea.

07:34.234 --> 07:36.153
Deliver you to safety.

07:36.359 --> 07:39.021
Our humble best you shared.

07:39.701 --> 07:43.060
Yet we receive insults in return.

07:43.887 --> 07:47.434
If our home is a hovel,
our weave to coarse,

07:47.536 --> 07:50.685
Our food tempts you not Royal Princess,

07:50.890 --> 07:54.239
bestow the honor of your
presents on someone else.

07:56.485 --> 07:58.018
You may help me now.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.276
You may help yourself.

08:00.761 --> 08:04.268
Come, Demetrius.
There are fish to be caught.

09:50.984 --> 09:52.986
Good evening, Petros.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.455
You're right, AntÃ­lia?

09:55.583 --> 09:57.119
Of course, why?

09:57.222 --> 10:01.007
Your face, so pale you look sick.

10:02.154 --> 10:04.085
Where is Demetrius?

10:04.588 --> 10:07.195
Spreading the nets to dry.

10:07.910 --> 10:09.555
I will help him.

10:12.558 --> 10:14.352
She is sick.

10:30.819 --> 10:32.648
Demetrius...

11:02.024 --> 11:05.029
Now neither you nor I,
have anything to hide.

11:06.910 --> 11:10.825
Will you hand me my robe,
or shall I come aboard as I am.

11:23.715 --> 11:25.365
Why, you...

11:52.649 --> 11:55.513
Beyond the sunset, is Atlantis my home.

11:55.645 --> 11:58.591
A land of wonders beyond compare.

11:59.870 --> 12:04.141
Take me to it, Demetrius.
My father will shower you with riches.

12:04.416 --> 12:08.805
Antillia, all the riches I desire,
I already possess.

12:10.039 --> 12:11.931
All save one.

12:14.077 --> 12:17.236
The one you will never possess, fisherman.

13:10.487 --> 13:12.259
Antillia.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.868
Antillia!

13:57.126 --> 13:58.644
Stand back!

14:03.371 --> 14:05.851
- Sit down!
- Oh!

14:11.227 --> 14:14.161
You must be mad.
There's a law against stealing a boat.

14:14.255 --> 14:17.388
I'm going home,
and no law will hinder me.

14:17.526 --> 14:19.669
Many men have tried.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.832
Many good seamen have
sailed into the sunset.

14:22.881 --> 14:26.499
But none has ever returned, Antillia.
Not one!

14:27.122 --> 14:29.323
- Are you afraid?
- Yes!

14:29.408 --> 14:33.645
And rightly so, endless terrors,
lurk beyond the great Pillars.

14:33.762 --> 14:37.464
I would rather chance it and die,
than live in your village another day.

14:37.572 --> 14:41.401
Ah, forget this foolishness.
I will not let you go.

14:43.307 --> 14:45.072
Very well, take me back.

14:45.248 --> 14:49.510
There are other men, braver ones, who would
beg for the privilege of doing my bidding.

14:49.632 --> 14:52.907
Put me ashore, and watch me
choose my traveling companion.

14:56.238 --> 14:58.394
Listen, Antillia.

14:59.038 --> 15:03.808
I will take you,
but only on my terms.

15:04.519 --> 15:08.091
Before the space of one moon,
I do not sight your land...

15:08.219 --> 15:10.490
We will return to my land.

15:11.014 --> 15:13.146
But wait that's not all.

15:13.775 --> 15:15.825
And when we return...

15:16.628 --> 15:20.551
You will become my beautiful wife,
forever more.

15:33.038 --> 15:35.912
As you say, Demetrius.

16:14.195 --> 16:16.179
Antillia!

16:20.133 --> 16:23.763
I can no longer tell east from west,
north from south.

16:23.913 --> 16:26.292
We must shore the sail and wait awhile.

16:26.367 --> 16:28.036
No need for that.

16:31.831 --> 16:33.491
This will guide us.

16:33.909 --> 16:36.546
It points always to the north.

16:40.103 --> 16:42.558
My father would call it sorcery.

16:42.681 --> 16:45.706
It's not sorcery it's, science.

18:15.550 --> 18:17.698
Demetrius.

18:21.997 --> 18:24.091
It's time we ate.

18:31.519 --> 18:32.846
No food.

18:32.918 --> 18:34.916
Just some wine.

18:40.229 --> 18:42.508
'Twas only a fish.

18:47.220 --> 18:48.782
Let me fill it.

18:50.142 --> 18:52.243
Shh!

19:00.055 --> 19:03.176
These are cursed waters,
we're turning back.

19:05.085 --> 19:08.543
A dolphin moans, and my
Captain regrets his bargain.

19:08.600 --> 19:12.533
It's not the bargain,
it's not the dolphins, it's everything.

19:13.124 --> 19:16.768
The fog, the silence when the wind goes.

19:16.884 --> 19:20.116
It's voice, when it returns,
whispering to me...

19:20.288 --> 19:21.733
Turn about.

19:21.848 --> 19:25.468
Turn about,
or you'll never moor you're lonely ship.

19:34.221 --> 19:36.507
Listen to my lips, Demetrius.

19:36.607 --> 19:38.749
They too whispers.

19:39.330 --> 19:41.827
But not of doom.

20:15.849 --> 20:20.418
Tonight will bring the full moon,
and there's still nothing ahead but sea.

20:23.911 --> 20:26.457
I shall hold you to your promise?

20:28.470 --> 20:30.582
I will keep it.

20:37.875 --> 20:39.656
We turn back then?

20:40.755 --> 20:42.550
Not yet.

20:42.757 --> 20:44.472
Our bargain is for one moon...

20:44.540 --> 20:47.355
...no more, no less.

20:51.954 --> 20:53.861
Demetrius.

20:54.105 --> 20:55.729
Yes?

20:56.864 --> 20:59.986
Is the edge of the world
at the Pillars of Hercules?

21:00.083 --> 21:01.451
No.

21:01.900 --> 21:06.334
And have you found unknown terrors,
lurking behind every wave?

21:06.893 --> 21:08.490
Well...

21:09.663 --> 21:11.294
Well?

21:11.744 --> 21:14.005
Well, I did see King Neptune.

21:14.122 --> 21:16.685
But you did not truly see him.

21:17.381 --> 21:19.255
Perhaps not.

21:19.863 --> 21:22.193
Have I then earned your trust?

21:22.442 --> 21:24.271
Forever.

21:25.636 --> 21:28.098
Then believe me now, my love.

21:28.354 --> 21:34.082
Before the full moon dies,
you shall gaze upon Atlantis. I promise.

22:48.646 --> 22:50.803
No, Demetrius.

22:52.303 --> 22:54.825
We're not in danger.

23:11.859 --> 23:14.468
We rejoice, Princess.

23:15.220 --> 23:19.250
Our Gods are kind.
They bring you safely home.

23:20.189 --> 23:21.839
With his help, Sonoy.

23:21.908 --> 23:25.594
A guard, take him aboard.

23:44.205 --> 23:47.728
- The name is Demetrius?
- It is.

23:48.390 --> 23:51.783
- Fisherman?
- I can handle the net.

23:52.474 --> 23:55.619
Could it be then, that you were born
under the sign of Pisces?

23:55.751 --> 23:58.238
- Sign?
- When were you born?

23:58.315 --> 24:00.504
What stars control your destiny?

24:00.594 --> 24:04.199
The stars are but for guiding
seamen across the seas.

24:04.485 --> 24:07.332
A man who speaks with a
voice of a true seaman.

24:07.493 --> 24:08.942
My name is Zaren.

24:09.024 --> 24:11.942
This is Sonoy, who reads the stars.

24:14.900 --> 24:18.185
With a ship like this, I would be
the greatest fisherman in Greece.

24:18.211 --> 24:21.161
You have no ships
that sail under the sea?

24:21.882 --> 24:23.739
Ah, Princess...

24:23.833 --> 24:27.278
Your in time.
We're about to surface.

25:44.978 --> 25:46.970
Why isn't my father here,
to meet to me?

25:47.049 --> 25:48.680
Didn't you send word to him?

25:48.727 --> 25:51.276
The moment we discovered you.
But he is not well...

25:51.302 --> 25:53.992
...he's waiting for you at the palace.

26:19.852 --> 26:22.008
- Pull'im off!
- Into the dungeon!

26:22.067 --> 26:24.419
What is this?
Let go of me!

26:24.514 --> 26:27.309
Let me go!
Let go!

26:28.771 --> 26:30.505
Father.

26:37.057 --> 26:38.923
Father?

26:44.395 --> 26:46.559
- Oh.
- Antillia.

26:47.269 --> 26:49.426
My child.

26:50.332 --> 26:52.519
They told me you were ill.

26:52.628 --> 26:55.730
Ill, I have been my dear
with grief and worry.

26:55.869 --> 26:58.709
Even though the stars foretold,
you're safe return.

26:58.735 --> 27:02.173
Did the star also foretell,
that a stranger would return with me?

27:02.246 --> 27:04.493
A stranger you say?

27:04.782 --> 27:07.470
Yes father.
A wonderful stranger.

27:07.563 --> 27:09.915
To whom will you give
my hand in marriage.

27:10.002 --> 27:12.503
But, but I had hoped that,
you and Zaren...

27:12.529 --> 27:14.962
I have never loved Zaren,
I never will.

27:15.057 --> 27:17.009
But wait child.

27:17.609 --> 27:19.622
We're forgetting the law.

27:19.973 --> 27:22.005
For me, you will change it.

27:22.333 --> 27:28.481
Don't worry my dear, It may take a little time.
Until then, it is best you not see each other.

27:29.276 --> 27:30.778
But now...

27:31.028 --> 27:34.747
Now I have a thousand questions.

29:27.963 --> 29:29.323
Thank you.

29:29.349 --> 29:32.265
Thank you for saving my life.

29:35.066 --> 29:37.131
Your face...

29:38.011 --> 29:40.123
I've not seen it before.

29:40.206 --> 29:43.365
I'm Demetrius, the fisherman.

29:43.640 --> 29:47.063
I'm Xandros, the sailor.

29:47.162 --> 29:48.649
Xandros.

29:48.716 --> 29:51.406
- From my homeland?
- Yes.

29:54.630 --> 29:58.133
And the others?
All these strange men.

29:58.502 --> 29:59.751
Where are they from?

29:59.822 --> 30:02.665
From land I never knew existed.

30:02.791 --> 30:05.924
Mostly seamen like you and I,

30:06.275 --> 30:11.503
blown off course, ship wrecked,
washed a shore.

30:11.733 --> 30:13.652
We sought sanctuary...

30:13.738 --> 30:18.191
...but found instead, whips, and chains.

30:19.169 --> 30:21.113
How long ago?

30:22.185 --> 30:25.613
A lifetime of suffering ago.

30:26.182 --> 30:29.614
One loses count, of time here.

30:32.286 --> 30:36.122
I will not be here long enough to lose count.

30:39.774 --> 30:44.526
Those were my very words,
when I was first brought here.

30:45.743 --> 30:48.762
To your feet!
There's work to be done.

30:48.788 --> 30:52.955
Come...
Come.

31:25.217 --> 31:30.096
Once they were men,
young and strong like you.

31:32.071 --> 31:34.330
But how could it be?

31:35.834 --> 31:37.641
They are monsters.

31:37.720 --> 31:39.820
How it is done, I do not know.

31:39.911 --> 31:43.422
But in this fowl land,
there are cruelties beyond belief.

31:43.524 --> 31:48.141
Time and again,
some of us are taken away without warning.

31:48.315 --> 31:49.104
Where?

31:49.130 --> 31:51.040
The house of fear.

31:51.240 --> 31:54.084
Never seen again they are
the beasts of burden.

31:54.186 --> 31:56.326
Show him what to do!

31:56.879 --> 32:02.646
Learn well and learn soon!
Or you'll feel the bite of this!

32:13.623 --> 32:15.333
What is that?

32:15.613 --> 32:17.988
The crystals born in the crater,

32:18.079 --> 32:20.879
capture the energy of the sun.

32:21.361 --> 32:26.262
The little ones,
are used for heat, and light.

32:27.638 --> 32:30.843
The big one,
could destroy the world.

32:30.933 --> 32:34.773
- Fill it, I said!
- No, no, no, no, no...

32:50.010 --> 32:52.267
One moment, your Highness.

32:56.267 --> 32:58.299
Clear these slaves out of the way.

32:58.360 --> 33:00.791
Into the ditch, all of you.

33:03.644 --> 33:06.163
Get back, move along.

33:08.131 --> 33:13.437
Forgive this your Highness, they'll have the filth,
cleared from your path in a moment.

33:25.383 --> 33:28.098
A gift, for the Princess.

33:30.654 --> 33:34.847
You insolent slave!
Release that pig!

33:49.363 --> 33:51.526
Your trusted Zaren, has lied to us.

33:51.624 --> 33:54.042
He's put the man who
saved my life in chains.

33:54.135 --> 33:55.839
I want him punished.

33:55.939 --> 33:59.484
But it was I, who gave the
order to enslave the Greek.

33:59.706 --> 34:00.666
You.

34:00.719 --> 34:03.453
His Majesty, had no alternative.

34:03.528 --> 34:05.734
By what right do you speak for your King.

34:05.814 --> 34:06.734
What does he mean?

34:06.760 --> 34:07.640
The law.

34:07.666 --> 34:09.876
The law compels us to enslave foreigners.

34:09.902 --> 34:14.552
And you my Princess, raised in the shadow
of the throne, must certainly respect the law.

34:14.833 --> 34:16.178
But what of my promises?

34:16.204 --> 34:18.770
And what of your word,
do they no longer mean anything?

34:18.795 --> 34:21.952
But he is a foreigner,
and all foreigners are dangerous.

34:21.978 --> 34:26.228
Indeed Princess, I've consulted the stars,
they do not favor him.

34:26.255 --> 34:29.438
- You see my dear.
- In fact the Greek should have been put to death.

34:29.465 --> 34:31.634
Yet I spared him.

34:32.690 --> 34:36.899
Surely this is in no way to show gratitude,
to the man who not only saved my life...

34:36.996 --> 34:38.646
...but risked his very own.

34:38.715 --> 34:40.967
Princess, you are unduly alarmed...

34:41.002 --> 34:44.591
... He can always gain his freedom,
through the ordeal of fire and water.

34:44.636 --> 34:47.873
He wouldn't survive, you know it.

34:49.342 --> 34:51.043
Father, please.

34:51.335 --> 34:55.346
You enslaved him.
Free him now!

34:57.594 --> 35:01.924
You have changed.
When I left, you were strong.

35:02.014 --> 35:03.269
You were a King!

35:03.353 --> 35:05.520
It's you, who have changed.

35:05.606 --> 35:07.596
I wish I could help my child, I...

35:07.622 --> 35:10.130
The law must be obeyed!

35:10.606 --> 35:13.314
How dare you presume
to speak for your King!

35:13.416 --> 35:16.064
One would think you wear his crown!

35:24.434 --> 35:27.021
In deed you do.

36:05.003 --> 36:07.334
Oh, Azor!

36:08.452 --> 36:11.647
Tears are of little use, Centurion.

36:12.167 --> 36:14.963
What has Zaren, done to my father.

36:15.765 --> 36:18.338
And what have I done to Demetrius.

36:18.988 --> 36:21.135
I know, little one.

36:21.559 --> 36:24.785
Come with me,
your prayers are wasted here.

36:25.724 --> 36:30.028
These Gods are false,
with hearts of stone.

36:30.225 --> 36:34.809
Azor...
Such talk is heresy.

36:35.526 --> 36:39.028
It is the truth.
Come.

37:19.947 --> 37:25.592
Up their my child,
there dwells the one true God,

37:25.766 --> 37:28.685
who created all living things.

37:29.025 --> 37:31.279
The true God is the moon?

37:31.401 --> 37:33.132
No Antillia.

37:33.280 --> 37:35.733
His hand, fashioned the moon...

37:35.922 --> 37:40.373
And sent it spinning,
through the galaxyâs of stars.

37:40.690 --> 37:46.787
That same hand, molded the earth,
with its high mountains, and deep seas.

37:47.432 --> 37:51.258
He gave life to you, and to me.

37:52.029 --> 37:54.039
Pray to him, Antillia.

37:54.127 --> 37:57.148
He will listen to your prayers.

38:18.032 --> 38:23.985
- The earth moved again last night.
- And gave us more work to do.

38:51.583 --> 38:54.449
Remove his chains,
he will come with me.

39:19.643 --> 39:20.654
Wait here.

39:20.680 --> 39:23.121
My orders are not to
let him out of my sight.

39:23.280 --> 39:25.421
Only nobles, may pass through these doors.

39:25.452 --> 39:28.158
Well this Greek, is no noble.

39:28.300 --> 39:30.447
Neither is he an Atlantean.

39:30.636 --> 39:34.782
The Gods do not recognize the presence of
barbarians, and he is one, is he not?

39:34.837 --> 39:38.284
- Yes, but I...
- Do you argue with your Gods?

39:38.513 --> 39:40.480
No, holy one.

40:19.033 --> 40:20.426
Wait.

40:20.628 --> 40:22.113
Wait, Demetrius.

40:22.164 --> 40:23.645
Why?

40:24.409 --> 40:26.012
You must listen to me.

40:26.067 --> 40:29.539
I listened once, and awoke in chains.
Isn't that enough?

40:29.605 --> 40:31.882
It wasn't my doing.

40:32.399 --> 40:36.249
Zaren, told me you chose to
return to Greece, and I believed him.

40:36.398 --> 40:38.802
Till I saw you yesterday.

40:39.834 --> 40:42.271
Then set me free, now.

40:43.140 --> 40:44.771
I can't.

40:44.888 --> 40:46.218
Why not?

40:46.683 --> 40:49.942
Your father is the King,
who will shower me with riches, remember?

40:50.012 --> 40:52.132
He is not the same King I left here...

40:52.180 --> 40:54.886
Zaren, has become the power in Atlantis.

40:55.048 --> 40:57.175
Then ask Zaren.

40:57.464 --> 41:00.399
He would have you killed,
if he knew I loved you.

41:00.751 --> 41:00.751
Subtitle created by,
Dandysubs and cryinoutloud.

41:01.150 --> 41:03.313
Love...

41:04.979 --> 41:08.809
You lured me to this miserable country,
by lies and trickery.

41:08.864 --> 41:13.223
You accepted my bargain, then made me believe
you loved me, to keep from turning back.

41:13.312 --> 41:16.528
And all the time,
knowing I would soon be enslaved...

41:16.554 --> 41:19.346
... is this love, Princess?

41:19.472 --> 41:21.352
I thought my father was above the law.

41:21.378 --> 41:22.402
You lie.

41:22.428 --> 41:25.463
You do not think beyond
your own selfish desires.

41:25.517 --> 41:27.830
At first, true.

41:28.574 --> 41:30.808
But when you took me in your arms...

41:30.863 --> 41:32.707
...my heart was yours.

41:32.775 --> 41:36.843
Your heart, comes dear Princess.
It is not worth the price I paid.

41:36.869 --> 41:41.613
Give it to Zaren. Give him your love,
and buy back my freedom.

41:43.152 --> 41:46.668
Even your words, smell like fish.

41:55.182 --> 41:57.243
Stay, Demetrius!

41:57.379 --> 42:00.665
I prefer the company slaves.

42:25.374 --> 42:27.155
Drink.

42:46.905 --> 42:48.460
Drink.

42:54.037 --> 42:58.861
Now, you will close your eyes.

43:01.842 --> 43:06.528
When you are commanded to open them again,
you will be a bull.

43:06.976 --> 43:11.911
Every day, and every way,
you will become more and more, like one.

43:12.067 --> 43:19.021
Strong, strong, strong.

43:23.029 --> 43:25.225
Take him away.

43:31.637 --> 43:34.001
Now bring me the Greek.

44:00.539 --> 44:02.789
And what shall you be?

44:03.571 --> 44:07.799
Part mule, with long ridiculous ears?

44:08.057 --> 44:09.635
Here?

44:10.026 --> 44:11.619
Or a...

44:11.744 --> 44:15.501
...a buffalo, with great horns.

44:15.611 --> 44:18.165
Here, here?

44:20.913 --> 44:23.658
But you, unlike the others...

44:23.720 --> 44:26.986
...will be able to remember who you are.

44:31.573 --> 44:34.557
Perhaps this would be appropriate.

44:37.153 --> 44:41.300
Think how it would amuse the Princess,
to see you as you really are.

44:41.356 --> 44:44.089
A filthy pig.

44:48.440 --> 44:49.483
Yes.

44:49.560 --> 44:51.084
I have orders my Lord, Zaren.

44:51.145 --> 44:53.965
He allows the Greek,
a chance to gain his freedom.

44:54.144 --> 44:57.918
Why do they always,
take my best specimens, away from me.

44:58.024 --> 45:01.919
But he must face the ordeal,
of fire and water.

45:02.909 --> 45:04.654
Alright.

45:04.762 --> 45:06.646
Take him.

45:12.330 --> 45:18.035
I will enjoy,
seeing you slowly roasted alive.

46:02.840 --> 46:05.066
What troubles you, Azor?

46:05.315 --> 46:07.616
The doves, look at them.

46:09.382 --> 46:13.972
In the past, they always circle the coliseum,
and then return to their cages.

46:14.348 --> 46:18.050
Now the whole flock
is winging out toward the open sea.

46:32.787 --> 46:35.872
Father it's Demetrius,
you must stop this.

46:36.432 --> 46:37.816
I will, my dear.

46:37.842 --> 46:42.359
But Your Majesty,
you can't disappoint your faithful subjects.

46:45.155 --> 46:46.988
Of course.

46:48.389 --> 46:50.269
I must not.

46:54.391 --> 46:56.806
There's nothing we can do.

52:37.870 --> 52:41.202
By his Majesty the King...

52:41.506 --> 52:46.530
Demetrius, is a slave no more.

53:14.422 --> 53:17.521
Here, in the middle of our vast ocean...

53:17.547 --> 53:21.553
...is Atlantis, our mighty empire.

53:22.106 --> 53:27.170
But no ocean is vast enough to contain
our might, our power, our ambitions.

53:27.405 --> 53:32.534
In the past, this one great crystal was
enough to supply energy for all our needs.

53:32.608 --> 53:34.011
But we cannot live in the past.

53:34.037 --> 53:37.315
If we are to survive,
we must live in the future.

53:37.426 --> 53:40.184
And as a monument to
the future, I have cause...

53:40.210 --> 53:43.410
...to be readied another, a greater
crystal in the belly of the crater.

53:43.436 --> 53:46.028
A weapon so powerful,
that with it, Governors of Atlantis,

53:46.054 --> 53:48.447
we can become, masters of the world.

53:48.473 --> 53:51.356
You speak of wicked things, Zaren.

53:51.543 --> 53:53.551
Do not listen to these words of war.

53:53.599 --> 53:57.426
It's the destiny of Atlantis,
to rule the world.

53:58.485 --> 54:02.485
Do not the Gods themselves call us,
the race of masters?

54:02.555 --> 54:06.758
And isn't it also written,
conquer or be conquered?

54:08.314 --> 54:10.462
Conquered by whom?

54:11.723 --> 54:13.899
I shall answer you.

54:14.566 --> 54:18.089
One country alone,
may not be an enemy worth fearing.

54:18.155 --> 54:20.556
But united with other countries,
could present...

54:20.582 --> 54:23.187
...a strength that would
endanger our very existence.

54:23.212 --> 54:24.136
No!

54:24.167 --> 54:27.711
Atlantis, can not take that chance.
We must attack them one by one.

54:27.737 --> 54:31.116
Our only assurance of survival,
is to attack and attack soon.

54:31.142 --> 54:33.242
No. No. No.

54:37.844 --> 54:40.224
Let Azor, be heard.

54:49.785 --> 54:52.613
You have arms,
that can repel any invasion.

54:52.658 --> 54:56.715
Any imaginary invasion
you can conceive.

54:57.749 --> 55:02.643
More important, we have erred, in deliberately
isolating Atlantis, from the rest of the world.

55:02.978 --> 55:06.533
We should have shared,
our advancements with all mankind.

55:06.589 --> 55:10.167
The mankind you speak of,
is good for one thing.

55:10.246 --> 55:11.987
Slavery.

55:12.471 --> 55:18.276
A country that depends upon slavery
for its existence... must perish.

55:18.538 --> 55:20.018
Your Majesty.

55:20.137 --> 55:22.956
Noble Governors of Atlantis.

55:23.786 --> 55:26.236
Long before he came,
it was written in the stars...

55:26.262 --> 55:29.229
...that a Greek fishermen
would reach our shores.

55:29.327 --> 55:32.221
That prophecy has been fulfilled.

55:32.649 --> 55:37.880
It was also written, that with his arrival,
the downfall of Atlantis would commence.

55:38.751 --> 55:43.786
The fact, that a barbarian, was able to
survive the ordeal of fire and water...

55:44.045 --> 55:48.480
...is a warning nobleman,
that we will be conquered by barbarians.

55:48.998 --> 55:51.855
Unless we conquer first.

55:58.659 --> 56:01.233
I call for war.

56:04.045 --> 56:06.555
We of the mountains, say war.

56:07.037 --> 56:09.563
And for the sea.

56:10.267 --> 56:12.266
War for the rivers.

56:12.548 --> 56:14.520
And for science.

56:15.335 --> 56:17.606
And the animals.

56:18.137 --> 56:19.996
War.

56:20.649 --> 56:22.777
War.

56:26.511 --> 56:28.909
You, priest?

56:44.245 --> 56:46.940
Let it be war.

56:56.278 --> 56:57.934
Empty?

56:58.859 --> 57:01.449
Just as all the others.

57:01.981 --> 57:04.128
The bees have deserted us.

57:04.237 --> 57:05.792
Strange.

57:06.057 --> 57:10.614
Each morning of my life,
I have awakened to the singing birds.

57:11.003 --> 57:13.872
Now only silence, greets the day.

57:17.738 --> 57:20.803
Perhaps it is instinct,
call it what you will.

57:20.916 --> 57:23.975
But they sense something, something evil.

57:24.020 --> 57:27.888
A strange breeze now rises,
with every outgoing tide...

57:27.953 --> 57:31.466
Blowing dead leaves,
out toward the open sea.

57:31.651 --> 57:34.367
The humblest insects,
seem to know it carries them...

57:34.392 --> 57:37.571
...not to destruction... but to survival.

57:37.671 --> 57:40.852
Even the seeds,
forsake their mother soil.

57:41.061 --> 57:44.344
All nature senses, that the end is near.

57:46.015 --> 57:49.676
Man alone, turns deaf ears
to natures warnings.

57:49.754 --> 57:52.676
The Princess would speak to you, Demetrius.

57:52.998 --> 57:55.465
I have no wish to speak to her.

57:55.681 --> 57:57.857
It is best that you do.

58:05.862 --> 58:08.582
I'm here to repay the debt I owe you.

58:10.223 --> 58:13.949
Tonight at moon rise, the fishing fleet
sets sail from the north harbor.

58:14.039 --> 58:15.520
Be there.

58:17.548 --> 58:22.376
One ship bears the Kings crest.
The captain will be waiting for you.

58:24.662 --> 58:27.829
He will take you aboard, and set you
ashore, at the Pillars of Hercules.

58:27.906 --> 58:30.175
You must find your own way from their.

58:30.286 --> 58:32.160
Antillia.

58:32.390 --> 58:36.035
If you suspect treachery,
set your mind at rest.

58:39.374 --> 58:42.165
The words I spoke when last we met...

58:43.410 --> 58:45.759
...they were words of anger.

58:47.362 --> 58:49.189
Forgive me.

58:57.885 --> 59:00.098
Thank you, Antillia.

59:01.341 --> 59:03.934
You owe thanks to no one.

59:14.673 --> 59:17.298
Your farewells, were said quickly.

59:18.235 --> 59:20.126
She loves you.

59:21.294 --> 59:23.534
I wish it were true.

59:25.837 --> 59:27.441
I'm leaving.

59:27.743 --> 59:30.288
Antillia, told me so in trust.

59:30.974 --> 59:33.139
Do you want me to stay?

59:33.574 --> 59:35.944
To remain in Atlantis, is to die.

59:36.046 --> 59:37.464
None will be spared.

59:37.566 --> 59:39.776
And doomsday is not far off.

59:39.972 --> 59:43.829
But no one can foretell the future,
not even a holy man.

59:44.462 --> 59:47.376
I was not always a priest my son.

59:47.970 --> 59:53.852
In the days when Atlantis, was a just,
and noble land, I was well versed in sciences.

59:54.448 --> 59:59.360
But I hid my eyes, when she began to
use her great knowledge for evil.

59:59.568 --> 01:00:04.034
And fashioned Gods,
after her own scientific achievements.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.909
For this, we will die.

01:00:07.276 --> 01:00:10.440
The true God, will destroy Atlantis.

01:00:10.842 --> 01:00:13.272
But why do you stay, Azor?

01:00:13.553 --> 01:00:16.749
Because, guilt rests heavy on my heart.

01:00:23.435 --> 01:00:26.405
We created wonders
for the good of mankind.

01:00:26.786 --> 01:00:30.024
Then turned them into monsters.

01:00:31.224 --> 01:00:35.930
The crystals capture the rays of the sun,
the base stores the energy.

01:00:36.121 --> 01:00:39.367
They seem identical yet,
vary greatly in function.

01:00:39.463 --> 01:00:42.289
Now, this is a model,
of the original invention.

01:00:42.741 --> 01:00:44.616
It's purpose...

01:00:45.154 --> 01:00:49.429
Provides warmth, and light, comfort.
Feel it.

01:00:55.631 --> 01:00:58.028
Now see what they have done with it.

01:00:58.349 --> 01:01:00.278
That urn...

01:01:23.665 --> 01:01:27.574
Zaren, now builds one that has
a thousand times more power.

01:01:27.629 --> 01:01:31.465
Within a moon, it will be ready,
and with it, he will subjugate the world.

01:01:31.708 --> 01:01:33.809
Why are you telling me this?

01:01:33.977 --> 01:01:37.857
You can warn the world,
your own people, when you reach home.

01:01:38.969 --> 01:01:41.294
But what defense, have we?

01:01:41.676 --> 01:01:43.451
None.

01:01:44.975 --> 01:01:47.209
And if I stay...

01:01:48.129 --> 01:01:51.263
What can I do, to halt Zaren's, plan.

01:01:51.368 --> 01:01:55.118
Nothing now,
but tomorrow may bring you a chance.

01:01:57.045 --> 01:02:00.673
I can not wait 'til tomorrow,
my ship leaves tonight.

01:02:01.808 --> 01:02:03.615
Demetrius...

01:02:10.604 --> 01:02:15.112
Dawn this seamen's garb,
it will make your boarding easier.

01:02:17.165 --> 01:02:19.292
Farewell, Azor.

01:02:22.636 --> 01:02:25.500
God, shield you my son.

01:02:43.666 --> 01:02:47.094
All my calculations,
add up to the same conclusion.

01:02:47.192 --> 01:02:51.672
On the next full moon,
you must depart for conquest.

01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:55.418
It'll give me little time,
to finish the crystal.

01:02:56.393 --> 01:02:59.856
It is the only date, the stars favor.

01:03:01.735 --> 01:03:03.783
It'll be ready.

01:03:04.937 --> 01:03:08.361
One man, Demetrius,
wishes to see you my Lord.

01:03:10.354 --> 01:03:12.422
 Let him enter.

01:03:17.872 --> 01:03:20.049
You need my help.

01:03:20.896 --> 01:03:23.487
Why would I need the help of a slave?

01:03:23.576 --> 01:03:27.349
Forgive my stumbling tongue,
a free man.

01:03:27.795 --> 01:03:32.232
I'm also a fisherman, who knows the waters,
and lands you do not know.

01:03:33.421 --> 01:03:38.378
I can lead your ship safely, through the
Pillars of Hercules, into the hidden sea.

01:03:38.658 --> 01:03:42.073
I can add color,
to the darkness of your chart.

01:03:42.748 --> 01:03:44.791
Why this change of heart?

01:03:44.864 --> 01:03:48.385
Other slaves would rather face death,
than give us guidance.

01:03:48.443 --> 01:03:51.369
I have tasted luxury,
and groomed an appetite for it.

01:03:51.419 --> 01:03:54.090
Your friends in the dungeon,
will call you a traitor.

01:03:54.265 --> 01:03:55.270
Let them.

01:03:55.369 --> 01:03:59.192
I can find comfort in,
silver, and beaten gold.

01:04:02.798 --> 01:04:04.241
Well?

01:04:05.384 --> 01:04:07.390
Are we to bargain with the slaves?

01:04:07.455 --> 01:04:09.554
He will bring us disaster.

01:04:09.809 --> 01:04:13.156
You must excuse, our impetuous astrologer.

01:04:13.342 --> 01:04:17.093
A bargain it is.
Proceed, Demetrius.

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:21.382
Let me see you change,
the face of the world.

01:04:32.154 --> 01:04:34.450
What do you think, map maker?

01:04:34.593 --> 01:04:39.434
Well my Lord is aware, that none of our ships
has ever returned, from the hidden sea.

01:04:39.504 --> 01:04:45.266
They must have perished in the, treacherous reefs,
or in the shifting currents, of the Pillars of Hercules.

01:04:45.318 --> 01:04:50.032
We therefore possess virtually,
no knowledge, only speculation.

01:04:50.112 --> 01:04:54.120
The chance, favors this,
being a trustworthy guide.

01:04:55.594 --> 01:04:57.813
I'll wager, not one detail is correct.

01:04:57.870 --> 01:04:59.425
We'll soon see.

01:04:59.530 --> 01:05:00.956
Guard.

01:05:21.529 --> 01:05:24.449
You, traitorous dog!

01:05:25.716 --> 01:05:27.491
You traitor!

01:05:27.545 --> 01:05:29.051
Remove him.

01:05:29.179 --> 01:05:31.941
You stinking, filthy, traitor!

01:05:32.004 --> 01:05:39.160
You filthy traitor! You swine!
You stinking traitor!

01:05:44.298 --> 01:05:46.301
I'll take my pay now.

01:05:46.446 --> 01:05:48.583
Of course, Demetrius.

01:05:48.804 --> 01:05:54.504
This is only a sample, of my generosity,
I may have need of your services again.

01:06:03.024 --> 01:06:07.350
I would never trust this Greek.
He lies with every breath.

01:06:07.602 --> 01:06:13.061
Dwell with your stars, Sonoy, and let
matters of importance, rest in my hands.

01:06:13.163 --> 01:06:16.841
I Trust men, who put wealth, above honor.

01:06:55.781 --> 01:06:57.724
Another warning.

01:06:58.374 --> 01:07:00.380
I measure the lava, every day.

01:07:00.457 --> 01:07:02.349
It rises steadily.

01:07:02.448 --> 01:07:06.297
A sea of boiling devastation,
below Atlantis.

01:07:06.386 --> 01:07:09.367
Straining at the throat
of this sleeping volcano.

01:07:09.471 --> 01:07:12.117
Waiting for the beginning of the end.

01:07:12.197 --> 01:07:14.020
When is the end, Azor?

01:07:14.107 --> 01:07:16.582
Soon after the next full moon.

01:07:16.728 --> 01:07:21.285
Soon after Zaren, and his warriors,
have set sail to, conquer the world.

01:07:21.413 --> 01:07:26.216
But if Zaren, is delayed,
this conquest can never take place.

01:07:26.302 --> 01:07:28.919
My Lord Zaren, waits impatiently.

01:07:37.261 --> 01:07:39.673
You should have been here before this.

01:07:39.995 --> 01:07:43.219
Look.
Another delay.

01:07:43.302 --> 01:07:47.435
There's little time left,
and the slaves, grow lazier by the hour.

01:07:47.652 --> 01:07:49.318
They can't help me.

01:07:49.403 --> 01:07:51.771
You must help me.
What can you do?

01:07:51.863 --> 01:07:52.794
Nothing.

01:07:52.862 --> 01:07:56.440
But you, a man of wisdom,
must surely know a way.

01:07:56.533 --> 01:08:00.550
There is a limit to mans endurance.
These men have reached that limit.

01:08:00.616 --> 01:08:02.315
They must rest!

01:08:03.237 --> 01:08:06.772
Our Priest, has a splendid remedy.

01:08:07.424 --> 01:08:08.749
Indeed.

01:08:08.845 --> 01:08:10.983
I have an even better one.

01:08:11.072 --> 01:08:12.397
Captain!

01:08:12.541 --> 01:08:14.980
A score of them, to the gallows.

01:08:15.173 --> 01:08:17.340
That will cure, the others.

01:08:17.421 --> 01:08:19.582
The gallows, is not the answer, Zaren.

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:22.406
Listen to a man, that was once a slave.

01:08:22.532 --> 01:08:24.281
What is your remedy?

01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:26.788
Put me in charge here.

01:08:27.947 --> 01:08:29.711
Then, what would you do?

01:08:29.791 --> 01:08:32.908
Put up a camp near by,
the dungeon is far away.

01:08:32.934 --> 01:08:36.376
The slaves weary,
before they begin their daily tasks.

01:08:36.433 --> 01:08:41.087
Remove their chains, discard the whip,
give them decent food.

01:08:41.171 --> 01:08:45.288
Ridiculous, why should I grant
such insane demands?

01:08:45.407 --> 01:08:47.969
You have no choice.

01:08:52.211 --> 01:08:53.671
Very well.

01:08:54.774 --> 01:08:58.509
Of course, my services
are not without a fee.

01:08:59.113 --> 01:09:01.884
You have sampled my generosity.

01:09:02.042 --> 01:09:05.017
You can rely upon it again.

01:09:06.086 --> 01:09:09.060
But if you fail...

01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:17.388
I will succeed.

01:10:34.513 --> 01:10:36.716
I'm awake, Xandros.

01:10:37.201 --> 01:10:38.819
The others are waiting.

01:10:38.866 --> 01:10:42.241
They believe as I, that Demetrius,
did not betray his friends.

01:10:42.282 --> 01:10:45.163
We're all eager to help
you with your plan.

01:10:47.958 --> 01:10:49.638
I've been thinking.

01:10:49.825 --> 01:10:52.466
Wishing I could do
something to help you.

01:10:56.434 --> 01:10:58.577
There's nothing you can do.

01:10:58.656 --> 01:11:00.725
Nothing anyone can do.

01:11:00.781 --> 01:11:04.006
It slowly eats its way,
through the will, of the mind...

01:11:04.072 --> 01:11:06.391
Till I'm no longer human.

01:11:06.559 --> 01:11:11.242
In the end, I must be locked up,
with the others.

01:11:11.902 --> 01:11:16.725
Come, we must be on our way.
I want to help you, while I still can.

01:12:20.176 --> 01:12:22.506
Remove the wedge.
Hurry, hurry!

01:12:22.532 --> 01:12:25.183
- Set the bit deeper.
- Hurry, hurry!

01:12:25.209 --> 01:12:28.021
- Volcano will wake!
- Hurry, hurry!

01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:30.661
- Destroy the crystal.
- Hurry, hurry!

01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:33.551
- Before the full moon.
- Hurry, hurry!

01:12:33.613 --> 01:12:36.639
- Before Zaren, sees us.
- Hurry, hurry!

01:12:36.670 --> 01:12:39.268
- Come up lava.
- Soon, soon!

01:12:39.294 --> 01:12:42.026
- Crystal be damned.
- Damn, damn.

01:12:42.073 --> 01:12:45.128
- Zaren, shall not conquer.
- No, no!.

01:12:45.178 --> 01:12:46.566
Hurry, hurry!

01:12:46.596 --> 01:12:49.093
Hurry, hurry, hurry...

01:13:13.728 --> 01:13:16.665
I want to be your wife, Demetrius.

01:13:19.358 --> 01:13:21.013
I love you.

01:13:21.211 --> 01:13:23.302
Take me away.

01:13:23.596 --> 01:13:25.591
I can't.

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.882
Your boat waits in the secret cove.

01:13:29.098 --> 01:13:31.976
Let's leave Atlantis, and never return.

01:13:34.685 --> 01:13:36.925
I have wronged you Demetrius, I know.

01:13:37.032 --> 01:13:39.519
No that's not it Antillia, believe me.

01:13:39.574 --> 01:13:41.441
What is it then?

01:13:42.839 --> 01:13:44.667
I can't tell you.

01:13:45.051 --> 01:13:46.885
Not yet.

01:13:48.044 --> 01:13:51.092
Very well,
leave me behind if you will.

01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:53.576
But you must leave Atlantis, at once.

01:13:53.624 --> 01:13:57.131
As soon as you finish your task,
Zaren, will kill you.

01:13:59.434 --> 01:14:01.807
That's a chance I must take.

01:14:02.902 --> 01:14:08.166
Please Princess, leave now,
the sun will soon rise and he needs rest.

01:14:14.496 --> 01:14:16.884
Trust me Antillia.

01:14:35.050 --> 01:14:38.858
- Volcano awake.
- Hurry more, hurry more.

01:14:38.884 --> 01:14:42.424
- Come up lava.
- Covering more, covering more.

01:14:42.450 --> 01:14:46.279
- Our days are numbered.
- Hurry more, hurry more.

01:14:46.332 --> 01:14:50.046
- Destroy the crystal.
- Hurry more, hurry more.

01:14:50.071 --> 01:14:54.498
- Before the full Moon.
- Hurry more, hurry...

01:14:57.568 --> 01:15:00.973
- Come up lava.
- Now, now.

01:15:00.998 --> 01:15:05.132
- Crystal be damned. - Damned...
- Shh!

01:15:12.585 --> 01:15:15.294
There, there!

01:15:23.212 --> 01:15:26.888
No, this way.
Quick, cover the entrance!

01:15:31.464 --> 01:15:33.780
They mustn't find the shaft.

01:15:53.381 --> 01:15:54.785
There they are!

01:15:54.908 --> 01:15:56.278
Go get them!

01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:59.121
We'll, kill every last one of them!

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:02.621
- There!
- Don't let them get away.

01:17:17.547 --> 01:17:18.859
Where is the Greek?

01:17:18.916 --> 01:17:22.072
He can not be far.
Find him!

01:19:04.871 --> 01:19:06.988
Free yourselves!

01:19:44.639 --> 01:19:46.951
The end has come.

01:19:56.119 --> 01:19:59.444
To the harbor!
Board the ships!

01:21:30.516 --> 01:21:32.805
Insolent gravel!

01:21:33.276 --> 01:21:35.344
Dare them, enter my palace.

01:21:35.467 --> 01:21:37.524
Follow me!

01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:11.761
No. No. No.

01:22:27.051 --> 01:22:28.980
Antillia!

01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:30.657
Antillia!

01:23:58.650 --> 01:24:00.587
Antillia!

01:24:06.589 --> 01:24:08.674
Antillia!

01:25:36.678 --> 01:25:39.904
The water's rising, we are trapped!

01:25:43.325 --> 01:25:47.197
No escape there, the harbor is sealed,
it's flooded with the lava!

01:25:47.223 --> 01:25:49.002
Here, this way!

01:26:40.334 --> 01:26:42.615
Damn you.

01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:40.532
Atlantis is gone.
