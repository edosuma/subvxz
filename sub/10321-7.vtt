one of these holes in ones,

12:49.402 --> 12:53.040
When you left, I had to take
a second job to pay the rent.

12:53.073 --> 12:56.143
I couldn't take care of him.
I gave him up for adoption.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.519
[ Sighs ]
I'll find your dog.

13:06.553 --> 13:10.223
- What?
- It's my fault he's gone.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.960
Just write the name of
the pet adoption place...

13:12.993 --> 13:15.495
on the back of the picture
and I'll find him.

13:15.528 --> 13:19.232
Okay. Great. Thanks.

13:19.266 --> 13:22.202
No, Earl,
you've already done so much.
You can cross me off the list.

13:22.235 --> 13:25.438
I don't mind.
It doesn't matter if
you mind. Karma minds.

13:25.472 --> 13:29.109
Your old life had a Poochie,
I gotta find your Poochie.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.278
That's how the list works.

13:31.311 --> 13:35.048
Come on, Bandit.
We got a long way to go
and a short time to get there.

13:35.082 --> 13:38.952
Sorry, Snowman.
We got a little
longer to go.

13:38.986 --> 13:42.389
- You guys are
gonna find Poochie.
- No, no, Earl. The fair.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.591
Excuse us.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.459
I hate you.

13:49.396 --> 13:52.232
Look, I have to do this.
The fair.
It's almost over.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.301
Really, Randy?
The fair's in town?

13:54.334 --> 13:56.970
This is the first time
you've said anything about it.

13:57.004 --> 14:00.407
You said we wouldn't miss it.
You'd cross something easy
off your list, and then we'd go.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.343
What do you want me to do?
Maybe if you'd quit whining...

14:03.376 --> 14:06.546
about the stupid fair
and helped out a little more,
maybe I'd be done already.

14:06.579 --> 14:10.183
Since when is the fair stupid?
We've been going since
we were little kids.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.919
Remember when
we used to have fun?

14:11.952 --> 14:14.221
Life isn't about
always having fun.

14:14.254 --> 14:17.324
Maybe it's time for you
to grow up and realize that.
Now go wait in the car.

14:25.565 --> 14:29.970
I'm sorry about that.
Don't worry. I'll find your dog.
But that's it, right?

14:30.003 --> 14:33.273
Then your life is exactly back
to the way it was seven
months ago? We're done?

14:33.306 --> 14:35.943
Yes. I think that should put
everything back to normal.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.611
- Good.
- Unless--

14:38.645 --> 14:42.215
You didn't have sex
with anyone else while
we were broken up, did you?

14:42.249 --> 14:44.952
I used my hand
on a guy a little.

14:47.254 --> 14:50.090
Yeah, I'm not sure how
to un-ring that bell.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.593
[ Sighs ]

14:53.626 --> 14:56.396
Randy? Randy?

14:56.429 --> 14:58.631
What's going on?

14:58.665 --> 15:02.502
My damn brother took off
with my car keys. Probably
hitched a ride to the fair.

15:02.535 --> 15:06.506
Well, that sucks.
Well, do you want a ride?
I was gonna shave anyway.

15:06.539 --> 15:09.242
Sure. Thanks.

15:14.314 --> 15:17.717
He's not in there.
Doesn't make sense. He's been
begging to come here all week.

15:17.750 --> 15:21.088
Well, people are funny.
When I was really into golf,

15:21.121 --> 15:23.991
Tess used to bug me about taking
her to Colonial Williamsburg.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.126
After she left me,
did she go?

15:26.159 --> 15:29.562
No. She went to Ozzfest and
churned some guy's butter.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.565
Oh, my God.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.268
I'm doing
the same thing you did.

15:35.302 --> 15:39.606
I'm obsessed with my list.
My list is my golf.

15:39.639 --> 15:42.209
I gotta find my brother.

15:57.224 --> 16:00.593
[ Earl Narrating ]
I wanted to tell Randy I was
sorry for the way I acted.

16:03.196 --> 16:06.433
I figured he'd eventually
show up at the Crab Shack,

16:12.339 --> 16:14.241
but he didn't.

16:37.197 --> 16:40.100
When he didn't
come home all night,
I started to get worried.

16:40.133 --> 16:43.203
I went to look for him
in the one place
I didn't want to find him.

16:43.236 --> 16:46.306
Hello there.
What can I do you for?

16:46.339 --> 16:49.742
This guy hasn't been
in here, has he?
Well, yeah. He's here right now.

16:49.776 --> 16:52.245
Where?
Right in front of me.

16:52.279 --> 16:55.148
That's you, silly.
[ Laughing ]

16:55.182 --> 16:58.451
How 'bout the guy in
the picture that isn't me?
Have you seen him?

16:58.485 --> 17:01.621
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he came in.
What happened? Is he okay?

17:01.654 --> 17:05.225
Don't worry.
He just wanted to sell some
of his blood for a bus ticket.

17:05.258 --> 17:08.395
Are you sure it was him?
Yeah.
I had to yell at him...

17:08.428 --> 17:11.631
because he was carving
in that chair over there.

17:14.501 --> 17:17.804
Yeah, I know that's me.

17:17.837 --> 17:20.440
How 'bout the guy in
the picture that isn't me?
Have you seen him?

17:20.473 --> 17:24.144
Oh, yeah. I sold him
a ticket to Hagerstown.
Hagerstown?

17:24.177 --> 17:26.413
Yeah. Oh, while we're
showing pictures--

17:26.446 --> 17:31.218
Here's my daughter.
That's her fiancé, Paul.

17:31.251 --> 17:35.522
He's Canadian.
But not the French kind,
so we're fine with it.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.427
[ Earl ]
So he ran off to Hagerstown,

17:40.460 --> 17:44.697
and he took my car keys,
and I couldn't follow him.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.801
I'm good. Thanks.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.515
I just hope he forgives me
when I find him.

18:02.549 --> 18:05.685
I just can't stand the thought
of him all alone somewhere,

18:05.718 --> 18:08.821
miserable and hatin' me.

18:22.935 --> 18:26.406
Stop the bus!

18:26.439 --> 18:30.543
Stop the--
Could you please tell him
to stop the bus?

18:30.577 --> 18:33.846
[ Tires Skidding ]

18:36.649 --> 18:39.652
You went to get the dog?
Yeah.

18:39.686 --> 18:43.156
The adoption place told me
where to find him in Hagerstown.
You were right, Earl.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.892
I shouldn't have
been complaining.
I should've been helping.

18:45.925 --> 18:48.261
Come here, Poochie.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.563
[ Earl Narrating ]
Thing is, I wasn't right.
I was dead wrong.

18:50.597 --> 18:53.566
Whoa!
But Randy was too sweet
to notice.

18:53.600 --> 18:57.737
That's when I realized I needed
to add something to my list.

18:57.770 --> 19:02.275
Number 260--
neglected Randy.

19:02.309 --> 19:05.412
And this is one I don't ever
plan on crossin' off.

19:05.445 --> 19:09.216
That way I won't ever stop
tryin' to make it up to him.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.818
Come on, Randy.
I bet if we get on this bus,

19:11.851 --> 19:15.355
we can catch the last
couple hours of the fair.

19:25.332 --> 19:28.235
That's okay, Earl.
We can go to the fair next year.

19:29.602 --> 19:33.273
Is that blue sugar
in a bag?
Yep.

19:33.306 --> 19:36.509
Can I have it?
All right. Go ahead.

19:42.249 --> 19:45.385
[ Earl Narrating ]
Randy was right. We would go
to the fair next year,

19:45.418 --> 19:49.522
but I still felt like
I owed him somethin'
for missin' it this year.

Caught up with the fair outside
Cumberland and convinced 'em
to rent it to us for the day.

The whole day.
