CHOSEN TO CREATE THE PERFECT
LITTLE GIRLS.

00:09.006 --> 00:11.020
BUT PROFESSOR UTONIUM
ACCIDENTALLY ADDED

00:11.022 --> 00:14.020
AN EXTRA INGREDIENT
TO THE CONCOCTION--

00:14.022 --> 00:16.017
CHEMICAL X.

00:18.026 --> 00:21.018
THUS, THE POWERPUFF GIRLS
WERE BORN!

00:21.020 --> 00:23.015
USING THEIR ULTRA SUPER POWERS,

00:23.017 --> 00:25.019

00:28.019 --> 00:31.009

00:31.011 --> 00:35.022
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY

ALL YOU CAN EAT--HOW I LOVE IT!

02:04.002 --> 02:07.009
- THERE SHE GOES AGAIN,
"MISS OVERDO-IT."

02:07.011 --> 02:08.005
[CHEWING]

02:08.007 --> 02:10.017
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

02:10.019 --> 02:11.016
- OH, NOTHING.

02:11.018 --> 02:13.012
- HERE ARE YOUR FORTUNE COOKIES.

AND ONE FOR YOU...

02:19.014 --> 02:21.015
AND ONE FOR YOU.

02:22.022 --> 02:24.016
- WHAT'S YOUR FORTUNE, BUBBLES?

02:24.018 --> 02:29.001
- "YOU BRING SUNSHINE TO
ALL WHO SURROUND YOU."

02:29.003 --> 02:30.027
I DO!

02:30.029 --> 02:32.013
- HA HA HA!

02:32.015 --> 02:33.014
- WHAT'S YOURS?

02:33.016 --> 02:35.018
- "YOUR QUALITY IS
THAT OF A LEADER.

02:35.020 --> 02:37.014
OTHERS ARE SURE TO FOLLOW YOU."

02:37.016 --> 02:39.012
- HEE HEE HEE!
- HEE HEE HEE!

02:39.014 --> 02:40.016

02:42.020 --> 02:47.020
- "BE NOT VIOLENT OR ANGRY.
PEACE LIES WITHIN."

02:47.022 --> 02:50.028
WHAT A STUPID FORTUNE!
IT WASN'T EVEN FUNNY.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.001
- I DON'T KNOW, BUTTERCUP.

02:52.003 --> 02:54.004
SOUNDS RIGHT TO ME.
- ME, TOO!

02:54.006 --> 02:55.009
- WHAT?!

02:55.011 --> 02:57.014
- I'M JUST SAYING YOU SHOULD
TAKE IT TO HEART.

02:57.016 --> 03:01.023
- YOU HAVE BEEN TAKING
YOUR FIGHTING A LITTLE
TOO FAR LATELY.

03:01.025 --> 03:04.015
- YEAH. YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO BEAT THE STUFFING

03:04.017 --> 03:06.010
OUT OF FUZZY SO BADLY.

03:06.012 --> 03:07.021
- POOR FUZZY!

03:07.023 --> 03:11.023
- HELLO! HE'S A STINKING
BAD GUY, REMEMBER?

03:11.025 --> 03:12.018
HE DESERVES IT!

03:12.020 --> 03:14.019
- HE GAVE UP.
IT WAS OVER!

03:14.021 --> 03:17.007
BUT YOU CONTINUED TO
BEAT HIM UP ANYWAY.

03:17.009 --> 03:18.026
- IT WAS A BIT MUCH.

03:18.028 --> 03:20.011
- YOU JUST DON'T KNOW
WHEN TO STOP.

03:20.013 --> 03:23.002
YOU'RE ALWAYS OVERDOING IT.
- UNH-UNH.

03:23.004 --> 03:24.020
- UH-HUH.
- UNH-UNH!

03:24.022 --> 03:26.020
- UH-HUH!

03:26.022 --> 03:28.010
- UH-HUH!
- UNH-UNH!

03:28.012 --> 03:29.024
- UH-HUH!

03:29.026 --> 03:32.021
- UH-HUH! UH-HUH!

03:32.023 --> 03:34.000
I'M THE GOOD GUY!

03:34.002 --> 03:36.023
- OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT!

03:36.025 --> 03:38.010
[GASP]

03:40.005 --> 03:42.002
- OH, FUZZY!

03:42.004 --> 03:45.021
- ARE YOU PROUD OF YOURSELF,
YOUNG LADY?

03:45.023 --> 03:47.002
- I...I...

03:47.004 --> 03:50.011
- THANKS TO YOU, HE CAN'T
EAT RIGHT, HE CAN'T TALK RIGHT,

03:50.013 --> 03:51.029
HE CAN'T EVEN THINK RIGHT!

03:52.001 --> 03:53.021
- BUT I...NO...

03:53.023 --> 03:59.003
NO! NOOOO!

04:02.015 --> 04:05.001
- WHAT GOT INTO HER?

04:10.024 --> 04:13.024
- THOSE JERKS! IT'S NOT
LIKE HOW THEY SAY.

04:13.026 --> 04:16.011
I'M JUST DOING MY JOB.
I'M JUST...

04:16.013 --> 04:18.017
OHH, WHO AM I KIDDING?

04:18.019 --> 04:19.022
THEY'RE RIGHT.

04:19.024 --> 04:21.002
I'M A MESS.

04:21.004 --> 04:24.013
I NEED TO CHANGE, AND I DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHERE TO START.

04:24.015 --> 04:27.002
- AT THE BEGINNING, GRASSHOPPER.

04:27.004 --> 04:28.022
- WHAT THE--WHO?

04:28.024 --> 04:30.001
I'M NOT A GRASSHOPPER!

04:30.003 --> 04:33.008
- KNOWING THE PROBLEM
IS THE FIRST STEP IN SOLVING IT.

04:33.010 --> 04:37.015
I CAN GUIDE YOU, BUT THE JOURNEY
IS YOURS ALONG TO TAKE.

04:37.017 --> 04:40.001
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT MY
PROBLEM IS. HOW CAN YOU--

04:40.003 --> 04:43.025
- GRASSHOPPER, BE NOT
VIOLENT OR ANGRY,

04:43.027 --> 04:46.001
FOR PEACE LIES WITHIN.

04:46.003 --> 04:49.006
- YEAH, YEAH. I GET THAT A LOT.

04:49.025 --> 04:52.029
- I THINK THIS WAS YOURS.

04:53.005 --> 04:55.005
- MY FORTUNE FROM THE COOKIE!

04:55.007 --> 04:56.007
BUT HOW DID--

04:56.009 --> 04:58.019
- TO CONQUER ONESELF
IS A GREATER VICTORY

04:58.021 --> 05:01.015
THAN TO CONQUER
THOUSANDS IN BATTLE.

05:01.017 --> 05:04.010
YOU NEED PATIENCE, GRASSHOPPER,

05:04.012 --> 05:05.022
AND WISDOM.

05:05.024 --> 05:07.028
- WAIT, WAIT!

05:12.004 --> 05:15.014
WOW! THAT IS SO COOL!

05:15.016 --> 05:17.023
WAIT FOR ME!

05:19.004 --> 05:20.027
- THE PATH WILL NOT BE EASY.

05:20.029 --> 05:21.026
- I'M READY.

05:21.028 --> 05:23.026
- ONLY THE MOST
SERIOUS MIND CAN--

05:23.028 --> 05:24.029
- THAT'S ME!

05:25.001 --> 05:27.002
- YOU MUST LOOK INWARD.
- GET ON WITH IT!

05:27.004 --> 05:29.027
- YOU MUST BE PATIENT,
GRASSHOPPER.

05:29.029 --> 05:31.011
- OH. SORRY.

05:31.013 --> 05:33.009
- YOU MUST LET GO.

05:33.011 --> 05:35.002
- I'M READY, TEACHER.

05:35.004 --> 05:37.027
- GOOD. WE BEGIN.

05:42.018 --> 05:45.027
THIS IS GOING TO TAKE A WHILE.

07:48.008 --> 07:51.015
[WIND BLOWS]

07:56.029 --> 07:58.025
- FIRE BEETLE.

07:58.027 --> 08:02.009
- YES, IT IS I.
THE PRODIGAL MONKEY RETURNS,

08:02.011 --> 08:05.002
FOR I LEFT BUT A STUDENT,
BUT I MUST BE THE MASTER,

08:05.004 --> 08:08.013
SO I HAVE RETURNED TO
BE THE MASTER, FOR I AM
NO LONGER THE STUDENT.

08:08.015 --> 08:10.001
AND TO BE THE MASTER,
I MUST DEFEAT THE MASTER,

08:10.003 --> 08:11.022
AND THEN I WILL BE THE MASTER
AND NO LONGER A STUDENT,

08:11.024 --> 08:15.002
FOR YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO
TEACH ME, BUT YOU COULD NOT
BECAUSE YOU ARE CRAZY,

08:15.004 --> 08:16.003
SO I HAVE TAUGHT MYSELF.

08:16.005 --> 08:18.002
NOW THIS MONKEY RETURNS
TO DESTROY YOU

08:18.004 --> 08:20.003
AND ELEVATE MY STATUS TO MASTER!

08:20.005 --> 08:22.004
HOW DO LIKE THEM APPLES,
FANCY PANTS?

08:22.006 --> 08:24.002
- YOU CAME SEEKING
ONLY VIOLENCE.

08:24.004 --> 08:29.002
YOU WERE IMPATIENT. YOU WOULD
NOT LOOK INSIDE YOURSELF.

08:29.004 --> 08:30.023
I COULD ONLY GUIDE YOU.

08:30.025 --> 08:32.012
THE JOURNEY WAS YOURS TO MAKE.

08:32.014 --> 08:35.014
I DID NOT FAIL YOU,
NOR THE TEACHINGS.

08:35.016 --> 08:36.027
YOU FAILED YOURSELF.

08:36.029 --> 08:38.008
AND ANOTHER THING:

08:38.010 --> 08:41.012
YOU'RE NOT A MONKEY, YOU'RE
A CHIMP. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

08:41.014 --> 08:43.009
- YOUR DOUBLE-TALK
NO LONGER WORKS ON ME,

08:43.011 --> 08:47.017
FOR I AM THE MASTER,
WHICH I SHALL NOW PROVE
WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY,

08:47.019 --> 08:50.002
SO PREPARE YOURSELF
FOR A WHUPPIN'!

08:50.004 --> 08:52.003
HOLD THE PHONE!

08:54.004 --> 08:55.024
A POWERPUFF GIRL?!

08:55.026 --> 08:59.015
- SHE IS MY NEW STUDENT
AND MOST ACCOMPLISHED.

08:59.017 --> 09:01.015
SHE HAS DONE WHAT YOU COULD NOT:

09:01.017 --> 09:03.015
SHE HAS CALMED HERSELF.

09:03.017 --> 09:05.010
- HER? YOU CRAZY TEACHER, MAN!

09:05.012 --> 09:08.024
SHE IS THE MOST VIOLENT
AND ILL-TEMPERED OF
ALL THE POWERPUFFS,

09:08.026 --> 09:11.024
THE MOST EASILY ENRAGED,
REVELING IN DESTRUCTION,

09:11.026 --> 09:13.019
ANGER, OVERKILL, AND...

09:13.021 --> 09:16.008
WELL, UH...I SHOW YOU.

09:18.007 --> 09:19.029
GIRLS ARE STUPID.

09:26.022 --> 09:28.025
I'M SMARTER THAN YOU.

09:33.020 --> 09:36.029
YOU CANNOT DEFEAT ME.
GREEN IS NOT YOUR COLOR.

09:37.001 --> 09:38.015
YOU LOOK FAT IN THAT DRESS.

09:38.017 --> 09:41.002
MMM! NO MATTER.

09:41.004 --> 09:43.010
ENOUGH TIME WASTED!

09:54.004 --> 09:56.011
OH, THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING!

09:56.013 --> 09:57.028
YOUR SHOE'S UNTIED.

09:58.000 --> 09:58.022
- HMM?

09:58.024 --> 10:01.002
- SUCKER MONKEY PUNCH!

10:07.009 --> 10:08.023
- WHAT SHOULD I DO, MASTER?

10:08.025 --> 10:12.008
- THE WATER RUSHING
DOWN THE MOUNTAINSIDE

10:12.010 --> 10:14.009
WASHES AWAY IMPURITIES

10:14.011 --> 10:16.007
AND REPLENISHES THE LAND.

10:16.009 --> 10:19.019
YOU MUST BE LIKE WATER,
GRASSHOPPER.

10:19.021 --> 10:22.007
- WHAT?
- KICK HIS BUTT!

10:22.019 --> 10:23.017
- OH, NO!

10:23.019 --> 10:24.025
- HEY-YAAAHH!

10:24.027 --> 10:27.026
- WAIT! I TAKE IT ALL BACK!
I DIDN'T MEAN IT!

10:27.028 --> 10:29.020
- BOOM!

10:30.013 --> 10:33.000
- AAAHH!

10:33.002 --> 10:35.006
OOH! UHH! AAH!

10:35.008 --> 10:39.009
UGH! OOH! EEE! UGH! OHH!

10:39.011 --> 10:42.023
- YEAH! HIGH-FIVE! WHOO-HOO!

10:43.000 --> 10:45.026
OH. YEAH. SORRY.

10:45.028 --> 10:51.015
- GRASSHOPPER, A SKILLED
WARRIOR STRIKES A DECISIVE
BLOW, THEN STOPS.

10:51.017 --> 10:53.014
BE NOT BOASTFUL OR ARROGANT.

10:53.016 --> 10:55.002
STRIKE OUT OF NECESSITY.

10:55.004 --> 10:58.010
TAKE NO DELIGHT IN
THE DEFEAT OF OTHERS.

10:58.012 --> 10:59.009
- YES, MASTER.

10:59.011 --> 11:01.015
- YOU HAVE DONE WELL,
GRASSHOPPER.

11:01.017 --> 11:03.011
FIGHTING EVIL IS YOUR PURPOSE.

11:03.013 --> 11:06.028
BUT REMEMBER: ALL THINGS
IN MODERATION.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.019
NOW, IT IS TIME TO
REJOIN YOUR SISTERS.

11:10.021 --> 11:12.019
- THANK YOU, MASTER.

11:12.021 --> 11:13.016
[KISS]

11:13.018 --> 11:16.029
- HA HA HA!
SHE'S A GOOD KID.

11:17.001 --> 11:20.008
- WOW! IT'S A WHOLE
NEW BUTTERCUP!

11:20.010 --> 11:24.001
WHO SAYS A GRASSHOPPER
CAN'T BE A BUTT-KICKER?

11:24.003 --> 11:26.026
AND SO ONCE AGAIN,
THE DAY IS SAVED,

11:26.028 --> 11:30.009
THANKS TO THE POWERPUFF GIRLS!

IT'S TURTLENECK AND TURTLENECK

- OH, YEAH. IT'S ALL THOSE HOURS
HE PUT IN DURING THE OFF-SEASON.

12:01.003 --> 12:04.011

12:04.013 --> 12:05.024
MEANWHILE, BACK IN...

12:05.026 --> 12:09.003

AND ITS RELATIONSHIP
TO THE PROLIFERATION

12:32.011 --> 12:36.025
OF RIBONUCLEIC PARTICLES
ON THE SUBATOMIC PLANE.

12:37.028 --> 12:41.003
OH, IT'S REALLY QUITE
FASCINATING, ISN'T IT?

12:45.024 --> 12:47.003

12:51.006 --> 12:55.003
- HELLO! IMPORTANT TELEGRAM

AN IMPORTANT TELEGRAM!

12:58.029 --> 12:59.021
