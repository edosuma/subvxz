00:05.547 --> 00:07.507
Daly: Give it up
for your Season 24 coaches...

00:07.549 --> 00:10.427
Whoo!
...John Legend, Gwen Stefani,

00:10.468 --> 00:14.472
Niall Horan, and Reba McEntire!

00:14.514 --> 00:17.809
* I know that you're tryin' *

00:17.851 --> 00:19.310
Whoo-hoo!

00:19.352 --> 00:22.230
* Ohhhhh *

00:22.272 --> 00:24.607
Come on, Kaylee!

00:24.649 --> 00:25.900
What a powerhouse.

00:25.942 --> 00:29.696
Your stage presence,
your vocals.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.698
Dope.
[ Laughter ]

00:31.740 --> 00:34.034
I'm holding onto this table
to stop the shakes.

00:34.075 --> 00:35.285
[ Laughter ]
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

00:35.326 --> 00:37.120
You feel like a real,
true artist.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.872
[ Whoosh ]
Daly: Whoa! We got two steals!

00:38.913 --> 00:40.582
Gwen Stefani and Niall Horan!

00:40.623 --> 00:41.833
No!

00:41.875 --> 00:43.001
Don't touch me!

00:43.043 --> 00:45.253
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:46.046 --> 00:48.423
Daly: The sound of a save!

00:48.465 --> 00:50.216
John: I'm gonna use my save
on someone

00:50.258 --> 00:53.553
that I know deserves
to stay in the competition.

00:53.595 --> 00:54.888
Guys,
last day of knockouts.

00:54.929 --> 00:56.264
Whoo!
Niall: Yeah!

00:56.306 --> 00:57.557
Reba, how are you feeling
about your team?

00:57.599 --> 00:59.100
I'm feeling really good
about my team.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.101
I'mfeeling good
about your team.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.436
Well, thank you, Gwen.

01:01.478 --> 01:02.854
I'm so impressed
with our artists this year.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.648
What's so incredible
is they're all so different.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.233
How do you judge
who's better?

01:07.275 --> 01:09.152
Niall, your team got so good
in the knockouts,

01:09.194 --> 01:12.739
really because of the coaching
they got from Dan + Shay.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.574
Is that what people are saying?
[ Laughter ]

01:14.616 --> 01:16.910
Anyway, guys, have a great
rest of your knockouts.

01:16.951 --> 01:18.536
Okay. Here we go.

01:19.412 --> 01:20.497
Mac: We got this.
Brandon: We got this.

01:20.538 --> 01:21.956
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

01:21.998 --> 01:25.001
We would not be here if --
if it wasn't meant to be.

01:25.043 --> 01:28.505
Two of these artists are steals.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.757
So, they were both
four-chair turns...
Mm.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.509
...that I turned for,
but didn't get them.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.427
It says blocked!
[ Laughter ]

01:34.469 --> 01:36.096
But I stole them
during the battles.

01:36.137 --> 01:38.306
Daly:
That's the sound of a steal!

01:38.348 --> 01:41.184
Let's do it. Let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Alright.

01:41.226 --> 01:42.560
Are you ready?
Yes, I'm ready.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.271
-What's up?
-Hello. What's poppin'?

01:45.313 --> 01:47.524
Look who our mega mentor is.
Brandon: Wow!

01:47.565 --> 01:49.067
It's Wynonna.
Oh, my! [ Chuckles ]

01:49.109 --> 01:51.194
Taylor, Brandon, and Mac --

01:51.236 --> 01:53.154
all very soulful singers.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.489
Different tones.

01:54.531 --> 01:55.949
It's a pleasure to be here.
So honored.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.992
And we're gonna get
some great soul music

01:58.034 --> 01:59.577
during this knockout.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.287
Alright, Brandon.
Let's go.

02:01.329 --> 02:04.624
I chose "Nobody Gets Me"
by SZA.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.376
Okay. SZA.

02:06.418 --> 02:08.378
Brandon,
you've taken on a challenge.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.380
* Nobody gets me *

02:10.422 --> 02:14.718
* You do-o-o-o *

02:14.759 --> 02:15.927
Mm.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.804
I love Brandon's tone.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.098
He's got
such a gorgeous tenor voice.
* Ohh, what's left of you *

02:20.140 --> 02:22.642
He reminds me of, like,
a male Brandy, in some ways.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.811
He does runs
kind of like Brandy and --

02:24.853 --> 02:27.772
and that kind of scratchiness
in his tone.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.315
That's a high compliment
among R&B singers.

02:29.357 --> 02:30.734
I will tell you that.

02:30.775 --> 02:32.444
I think it's just the very,
very highest note

02:32.485 --> 02:33.778
that's a little high.
Yes.

02:33.820 --> 02:34.946
And if you feel like

02:34.988 --> 02:36.656
you want to drop down
to the lower note,

02:36.698 --> 02:38.533
if you're comfortable,
it's just gonna sound better.

02:38.575 --> 02:41.244
You just told the story
about a breakup.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.955
I believe you in here.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.623
You're here.
Got you.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.668
I want you to put your hands
on the wheel of the car.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.171
The windows are down,
and you're pulling away,

02:51.212 --> 02:53.048
and your heart is broken.

02:53.089 --> 02:54.466
Tell me a story.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.092
* Nobody gets me *

02:56.134 --> 03:00.013
* You do-o-o-o *

03:00.055 --> 03:01.556
Brandon:
I can relate to this song

03:01.598 --> 03:04.184
because I've kind of had
that similar situation.

03:04.225 --> 03:05.685
I've been in
a six-year relationship,

03:05.727 --> 03:07.354
just that one person who I knew

03:07.395 --> 03:09.230
that just believed in me
no matter what.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.149
After the breakup,
it was really hard

03:11.191 --> 03:12.942
to just get back out there
again.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.361
But I found myself again,

03:14.402 --> 03:17.364
and I'm just ready
to express that through song.

03:17.405 --> 03:19.032
Just let it flow.
You have everything.

03:19.074 --> 03:20.200
This is a true story
for you.

03:20.241 --> 03:22.869
Now I'm applying this song

03:22.911 --> 03:25.330
to John
and being on his team.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.040
This guy has given me
another chance.

03:27.082 --> 03:29.584
I'm thankful that I was
the one to get that steal.

03:29.626 --> 03:33.338
* Nobody gets me,
you do *

03:33.380 --> 03:35.131
I get you.
Oh, thank you.

03:35.173 --> 03:39.636
I'm not so comfortable
just yet with being vulnerable.

03:39.678 --> 03:41.513
Thank you, Brandon.
Thank you both.

03:41.554 --> 03:44.766
But having John and Wynonna
in my corner --

03:44.808 --> 03:47.977
it's just giving me that push
that I've always needed.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.062
Taylor!

03:49.104 --> 03:51.106
Hi.
Wynonna: Hi, Taylor.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.524
What song did you pick?

03:52.565 --> 03:55.068
I'm singing "Sweet Thing"
by Rufus and Chaka Khan.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.237
Oh! A classic.
Oh.

03:57.278 --> 04:00.115
Yes.
* I will love you anyway *

04:00.156 --> 04:01.491
Oh, yes.

04:01.533 --> 04:04.577
* I will love you anyway *

04:04.619 --> 04:06.413
* Even if you cannot stay *

04:06.454 --> 04:09.416
I love this song because
it's actually the first song

04:09.457 --> 04:12.127
that I heard
by Rufus and Chaka Khan

04:12.168 --> 04:13.461
when I was a kid.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.880
And I knew
when I decided to be a singer,

04:15.922 --> 04:18.216
I wanted to be a powerhouse
like her.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.343
* Love me now
or I'll go crazy *

04:20.385 --> 04:24.431
* Whoaaa *
I went to a concert
of Chaka Khan's in 2019,

04:24.472 --> 04:28.184
and at one point,
she was talking to the audience.

04:28.226 --> 04:31.604
And I don't know what it was,
but she started talking to me.

04:31.646 --> 04:34.149
And she just said,
"Do you know this song?"
* Oh, ya know
you're my everything *

04:34.190 --> 04:35.567
And she just put the mic out,

04:35.608 --> 04:37.402
and I just started
riffing into the mic.

04:37.444 --> 04:40.321
* Whoaaa, sweet thing, yeah *
The crowd started going wild,

04:40.363 --> 04:45.201
and that was an amazing and
spontaneous experience for me.
* Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh *

04:45.243 --> 04:47.620
* Yeah *

04:47.662 --> 04:50.165
Alright.
Girl, you can sing. [ Laughs ]

04:50.206 --> 04:51.750
You're so good.
Thank you.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.002
I really want to just slap you.

04:54.044 --> 04:55.545
[ Laughter ]

04:55.587 --> 04:58.381
My background singers
would literally come up to me

04:58.423 --> 04:59.966
and act like
they were gonna slap me,

05:00.008 --> 05:04.304
'cause I was in their moment
of being such a good singer.

05:04.346 --> 05:05.972
And it's
the ultimate compliment.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.766
I hope she got that.

05:08.475 --> 05:11.311
Paul,
it feels a little fast.

05:11.353 --> 05:12.687
We can bring it back
if you want.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.814
Yeah, I just want it
to be a little more sultry.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.274
Here we go.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.693
Make your energy a little
more sultry and less happy.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.487
Don't be so happy.
[ Laughs ]

05:20.528 --> 05:22.322
More like in a smoke-filled
lounge kind of energy.
Got it.

05:22.364 --> 05:23.531
You know what I'm saying?
Mm-hmm.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.450
As my son says,
"Mom, chillax."

05:25.492 --> 05:27.118
[ Laughs ]

05:27.160 --> 05:28.995
* I will love you anyway *

05:29.037 --> 05:31.247
Yeah!
* Even if you cannot stay *

05:31.289 --> 05:32.999
Taylor:
This song is not easy,

05:33.041 --> 05:35.168
so I want to show John...
* I think
you are the one for me *

05:35.210 --> 05:36.378
...that I'm not afraid.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.797
I'm not backing down.
I'm ready.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.173
* You are my heat,
you are my fire *

05:40.215 --> 05:42.676
John: Taylor's voice
is sweet like honey.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.594
* You make me weak
with strong desire *
I think it's the right vibe
for her voice,

05:44.636 --> 05:46.596
and I think she's gonna shine
in this moment.

05:46.638 --> 05:49.599
* Cra-a-a-zy *

05:49.641 --> 05:51.601
Wynonna: [ Laughing ]

05:51.643 --> 05:52.769
Hey!

05:52.811 --> 05:55.105
Yeah. That's the tempo.
Okay.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.815
"Everythang."
It's T-H-A-N-G, by the way.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.900
It's "everythang."
[ Laughter ]

05:58.942 --> 06:00.485
The tempo --

06:00.527 --> 06:03.238
it made you sing more soulfully
and more sultrily...
Mm-hmm.

06:03.279 --> 06:04.572
...and it was, like,
exactly what we needed.

06:04.614 --> 06:05.949
Is that a word?
Yeah, I don't know.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.826
"Sultr--" "Sulture."
I don't even know.

06:07.867 --> 06:11.496
[ Laughs ]
That was my attempt
at word manufacturing.

06:11.538 --> 06:15.417
Taylor sung the roof
off of that place.

06:15.458 --> 06:16.668
Mr. Mac.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.378
It is
a little bit more pressure.

06:18.420 --> 06:21.631
But I'm gonna give them
my absolute all.

06:28.471 --> 06:29.639
* This is "The Voice" *

06:29.681 --> 06:31.266
Daly: Welcome back
to the knockouts.

06:31.307 --> 06:34.102
John: Mr. Mac,
what song did you choose?

06:34.144 --> 06:37.647
I'm doing "Lost Without U"
by Robin Thicke.
Oh, okay.

06:37.689 --> 06:40.150
* Tell me
how you love me more *

06:40.191 --> 06:42.610
* How you think I'm sexy,
baby *

06:42.652 --> 06:45.488
Mac: My dad loved music, which
is really one of the reasons

06:45.530 --> 06:47.699
why I started to sing R&B.

06:47.741 --> 06:48.950
My father was incarcerated

06:48.992 --> 06:50.994
for the majority
of my younger childhood,

06:51.036 --> 06:52.579
which was always really tough,

06:52.620 --> 06:54.914
because I really did miss
my father.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.583
* Tell me you depend on me *

06:56.624 --> 06:59.169
* I need to hear it *
When he got out,
my dad opened...

06:59.210 --> 07:01.379
* I'm lost without you *
...this kind of like
speakeasy lounge

07:01.421 --> 07:03.715
called
the Union Restaurant and Lounge.
* Can't help myself *

07:03.757 --> 07:05.675
I watched my father go...

07:05.717 --> 07:07.802
* How does it feel to know... *
...from a prisoner
to a business owner.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.971
* ...that I love you,
baby? *

07:10.013 --> 07:11.848
My dad always did an amazing job

07:11.890 --> 07:13.975
at creating opportunities
for me to grow.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.935
He was like,
"Boy, get up on that stage,

07:15.977 --> 07:17.687
'cause if this
is what you're gonna do,

07:17.729 --> 07:18.813
you're gonna do it."

07:18.855 --> 07:20.273
And so at 17 years old,

07:20.315 --> 07:22.025
I started actually covering
this song.

07:22.067 --> 07:28.031
* Know that I love you, baby,
yea-a-a-h *

07:28.073 --> 07:29.032
Dang.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.700
[ Chuckling ] Mm-hmm!
Mm-hmm.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.869
Oh, your voice
is so nice, man.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.287
Velvet.
[ Laughs ]

07:34.329 --> 07:35.622
He has a beautiful tone

07:35.663 --> 07:37.582
in that higher part
of his chest voice,

07:37.624 --> 07:39.376
in that mixed voice.
It's very sexy.

07:39.417 --> 07:40.710
It's dope.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.045
And then,
when you think about staging,

07:42.087 --> 07:43.838
just connect with somebody.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.256
Work with Gwen!

07:45.298 --> 07:46.508
Yeah, yeah.
Yes.

07:46.549 --> 07:47.550
I got to make her feel it.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.177
[ Laughter ]

07:49.219 --> 07:51.763
Sing it like you don't care
that you're on "The Voice."

07:51.805 --> 07:54.015
Just throw it away,
all the pressure.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.726
* I just love
to hear you say it *

07:56.768 --> 07:59.104
* Makes a man feel good,
baby *

07:59.145 --> 08:01.564
When you're doing this,
that --

08:01.606 --> 08:04.067
your body's there,
and it feels really good to me.

08:04.109 --> 08:06.236
I think he does have
superstar quality.

08:06.277 --> 08:09.322
He's soulful,
and he's got that thing.

08:09.364 --> 08:11.533
He's a mack! He's a mack!
He's a mack!

08:11.574 --> 08:14.619
* You wanna roll with me,
you wanna hold with me *

08:14.661 --> 08:17.664

18:38.118 --> 18:39.661
Team Legend, baby.

18:39.703 --> 18:40.787
Yeah, yes.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.205
Coaches,
let me remind you

18:42.247 --> 18:43.540
that Brandon is available
to save.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.375
Brandon, anything you'd like
to say to John?

18:45.417 --> 18:47.293
I just hope I did you proud.

18:47.335 --> 18:50.338
I'm so glad
you came back for this round,

18:50.380 --> 18:53.883
because you showed America
how dope you really are.

18:53.925 --> 18:55.677
Thank you so much.
[ Cheers and applause ]

18:55.719 --> 18:58.513
This season, the magnitude
of the talent is just insane,

18:58.555 --> 19:01.141
and we had no more steals left.

19:01.182 --> 19:02.559
You did so good.
Thank you.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.644
You've worked with people,
gotten to know them,

19:04.686 --> 19:06.730
watched them grow,
and then they're going home.

19:06.771 --> 19:09.566
It makes it really
emotionally tough this season.

19:09.607 --> 19:10.567
Coaches,
let me remind you

19:10.608 --> 19:12.235
Taylor is available to save.

19:12.277 --> 19:14.696
Taylor, anything you'd like
to say to your coach?

19:14.738 --> 19:17.449
I told myself that one day
I would get to work with you,

19:17.490 --> 19:19.284
and I'm just so grateful.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.494
Thank you, John.
Pizza!

19:21.536 --> 19:22.954
There it is!
[ Laughs ]

19:22.996 --> 19:25.457
The sound of a save!
[ Cheers and applause ]

19:25.498 --> 19:26.708
John: This is crazy.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.126
I don't think
we've ever had knockouts

19:28.168 --> 19:31.087
with this level
of high-quality performances.

19:31.129 --> 19:33.923
I'm so excited to see what these
artists do in the playoffs.

19:33.965 --> 19:37.761
John Legend saves Taylor Deneen!
You're not going home!
[ Laughs ]

19:37.802 --> 19:39.554
Taylor
is a really special singer.

19:39.596 --> 19:40.764
Her voice is so sweet.

19:40.805 --> 19:42.307
But when she goes
for those big notes,

19:42.349 --> 19:44.142
it's also really powerful.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.770
John is my absolute.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.355
[ Both laugh ]

19:48.396 --> 19:50.357
Ah! I'm so happy.
Me too.

19:50.398 --> 19:51.608
We're gonna keep going.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.234
We're going to the playoffs,
girl.

19:53.276 --> 19:55.111
Playoffs!
[ Both laugh ]

19:55.153 --> 19:56.780
Oh, she's good.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.948
It's been mind-boggling how
much talent we've seen today.

19:58.990 --> 20:02.702
I think that you could get
a lot of superstars out of this.

20:02.744 --> 20:04.704
Definitely from Team Reba.

20:04.746 --> 20:06.539
Wynonna: Hello.
Here we go.

20:06.581 --> 20:08.583
Here we go.
What are you gonna sing for us?

20:08.625 --> 20:10.293
"hole in the bottle"
by Kelsea Ballerini.

20:10.335 --> 20:11.795
Oh, wow.
Why did you pick that song?

20:11.836 --> 20:14.422
Jordan: It's a sassy,
up-tempo, fun song.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.925
It's gonna show another side of
me that they haven't seen yet.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.718
And, you know,
a dog is a man's best friend,

20:18.760 --> 20:20.470
but a wine
is a woman's best friend.

20:20.512 --> 20:22.347
It gets you through the wedding
and the divorce.

20:22.389 --> 20:25.141
Good answer.
[ Laughter ]

20:25.183 --> 20:28.645
* There's a hole
in the bottle of wine *

20:28.687 --> 20:30.146
Wow.
Oh, that's right.

20:30.188 --> 20:31.398
Jordan --
she's got a great range.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.149
And this song
shows her vocals off.

20:33.191 --> 20:35.985
She's the most country act
I have on my team.

20:36.027 --> 20:38.488
* There's a hole in the bottle
leakin' all this wine *

20:38.530 --> 20:41.658
She's got great
tough-girl attitude.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.660
It's fun to have somebody
totally different.

20:43.702 --> 20:45.662
The world needs
to hear your voice.

20:45.704 --> 20:47.956
I love
a woman who's sassy.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.541
You're a kick in the butt.
Oh, thank you.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.001
We need that sound.

20:51.042 --> 20:54.170
We need that pure country twang,
kind of "huh huh."

20:54.212 --> 20:55.839
Mm-hmm.
It's just good.

20:55.880 --> 21:00.844
* There's a hole in the bottle
leakin' all this wine *

21:00.885 --> 21:04.806

* Honey, no, I don't miss him *

21:07.934 --> 21:09.894
* In fact, it slipped my mind *

21:09.936 --> 21:13.440
* There's a hole
in the bottle of wine *

21:13.481 --> 21:16.401
Oh, that's right!
Whoo-hoo!

21:16.443 --> 21:17.777
Yeah!

21:17.819 --> 21:20.196
It's interesting
that you did a Kelsea song,

21:20.238 --> 21:22.866
because she's like this, like,
little Barbie singing this song.

21:22.907 --> 21:25.702
But when you did it,
I saw it in a whole new way.

21:25.744 --> 21:27.495
Yeah.
I don't have a Barbie side.

21:27.537 --> 21:29.539

21:34.711 --> 21:38.131
Jordan, you're witty.
You're so talented.

21:38.173 --> 21:40.300
The winner of this knockout
is Jordan.

Jordan stole the show.

21:43.511 --> 21:45.930
She's mysterious.
She's crafty.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.807
You did it again.
I'm her coach,

21:47.849 --> 21:49.809
and I can't wait
to see what she does.

21:49.851 --> 21:51.478
Love you, hon.
Love you, too.

21:51.519 --> 21:55.106
I have five incredible artists
going into the playoff rounds.

I'm so proud.

It felt so moving to me.

22:09.454 --> 22:11.581
...and move our coaches
to tears.

Niall:
These two crying says it all.

And there's no steals
or saves left.

We've changed the rules.

on "The Voice."

They will be great mentors.

when I walked into rehearsals

23:02.215 --> 23:06.386
and I saw that Wynonna Judd
was our mega mentor,

about all you guys.

And then Dan + Shay are people
that I listen to all the time.

I got to tell you guys, I sang
one of your songs for my wife,

23:21.526 --> 23:22.944
like, the first song
I ever sang.

23:22.986 --> 23:24.863
It was a Dan + Shay song.
No way! No way!

23:24.904 --> 23:26.906
It was just a big, emotional
experience all at once.

23:26.948 --> 23:29.492
It was crazy.
It is a tremendous honor

23:29.534 --> 23:32.162
that you are our mega mentor.
I'm mega.

23:38.209 --> 23:39.919
I'm gonna be singing "Believe"
by Cher.

When I had stripped the song
down and felt it in a real way,

23:43.173 --> 23:45.717
I was like,
"This is incredible."

23:45.759 --> 23:48.636
I wanted it to represent me
as the artist that I am,

23:48.678 --> 23:50.847
almost as if I had written
the song myself.

23:50.889 --> 23:52.182

23:52.223 --> 23:57.771
* Do you believe
in life after love? *

23:57.812 --> 23:59.189
I was really taken back

23:59.230 --> 24:01.775
by how much
I actually relate to this song.

24:01.816 --> 24:04.694
I went through
one of the most beautiful

24:04.736 --> 24:06.988
and heartbreaking
relationships.

24:07.030 --> 24:08.323
It was my first love.

24:08.365 --> 24:10.867
No matter how hard we tried
to be together,

24:10.909 --> 24:12.994
it was this push and pull.

24:13.036 --> 24:16.498
Ultimately, the greatest grace
both of us gave each other

24:16.539 --> 24:19.292
was to let each other go.
* ...something
inside me say *

* I really don't think
you're strong enough, no *

I began to cry, and I think
that's the greatest compliment.

When Alexis sang, she felt it
in a way that's so vulnerable.

24:31.805 --> 24:36.184
To be raw like that made me
an absolute believer.

you're strong enough *

Last night,
I drove through Laurel Canyon,

24:48.822 --> 24:50.407
and I went by
Joni Mitchell's house.

24:50.448 --> 24:54.244
She's my shero.
You remind me of a young Joni.

24:54.285 --> 24:58.248
Your interpretation of this song
was flawless.

24:58.289 --> 24:59.374

If I could give you
any bit of advice

when you go to the big show,
when it's --

25:02.293 --> 25:04.004
when it's really time
to do it...
Yeah.

...feel all the emotion,
take it in.
Yeah.

Because when you're feeling that
in such a big way,

25:07.632 --> 25:09.092
everybody watching
will feel it.

25:09.134 --> 25:10.719
Shay:
Alexa's version of "Believe"

25:10.760 --> 25:13.430
was genuinely one of
the most awestruck moments

25:13.471 --> 25:14.931
that I've ever had in my life.

25:14.973 --> 25:19.394
* I really don't think
you're strong enough, no *

25:19.436 --> 25:20.687
She is one of those people

25:20.729 --> 25:22.981
who just feels every bit
of every emotion.

25:23.023 --> 25:27.235
She is a total empath.
* Belie-e-e-e-ve *

when he said

on his team.

so of course I'm nervous.

But as long as I'm able
to be proud of what I do,

25:45.795 --> 25:47.881
I'm totally okay
with what happens.

25:47.922 --> 25:50.800
The song that I picked
is "Unstoppable" by Sia.

25:50.842 --> 25:52.385
What made you pick
this song?

25:52.427 --> 25:55.472
This story was just so strong
and powerful,

25:55.513 --> 25:58.850

to everyone that I am, too.

about portraying yourself

as a strong person...
* I'm invincible *

that's who I am inside.

26:17.994 --> 26:19.996
and I did ski racing.

26:20.038 --> 26:21.915
I was, like, number one
for a year.

that helped me

26:23.833 --> 26:25.835
go down the mountain
as quick as I could,

26:25.877 --> 26:28.922
and this would be the song
that I would play.

26:28.963 --> 26:31.341
* I'm unstoppable today *

is I want you to really follow
your heart with that song

Yeah.

27:11.464 --> 27:13.383
...I think your pocket,
just make sure

27:13.425 --> 27:15.385
that you're not getting
ahead of the beat.

Dan: Julia is wise
beyond her years.

27:18.513 --> 27:20.890
* I'm a Porsche with no brakes *
She needs to come into this
with confidence,

27:20.932 --> 27:22.684
knowing she can do it,
because she can.

27:22.726 --> 27:24.227
I have one more thing to say --

27:24.269 --> 27:29.816
be on time, be kind,
and listen more and talk less.

27:29.858 --> 27:32.027
I was not that girl,

27:32.068 --> 27:34.696
and I had people
telling me those things.

27:34.738 --> 27:37.407
The other stuff will be harder
for you than singing,

27:37.449 --> 27:39.367
'cause you're so good
at singing.

27:39.409 --> 27:40.910
So do well.

27:40.952 --> 27:43.747
That's the best advice
that you could possibly ever get

27:43.788 --> 27:45.498
right there.
No. I got that early.

27:45.540 --> 27:46.958
Alright. Lennon.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.919
It was wild to see both Alexa
and Julia perform.

27:49.961 --> 27:51.796
That's an intimidating thing
to follow up.

27:51.838 --> 27:54.758
So I need to step up and show
that I've got what it takes.

Lennon, you and Niall look like
you could be brothers, man.

I swear -- I was
just gonna say that, yeah.

28:09.064 --> 28:10.648

that connection on TV

You're the American Niall.

American Niall.

28:14.736 --> 28:17.405
Thank you, man. Thank you.
Happy to be here.
Yeah.

28:17.447 --> 28:19.491
I've been full-time music
for a couple of years now,

28:19.532 --> 28:20.992
and it's a hard thing.

28:21.034 --> 28:23.495
So, I'm singing
"I Won't Give Up" by Jason Mraz.

28:23.536 --> 28:26.331
When I think of the moments
that I feel the most alive,

28:26.373 --> 28:29.250
it's always had something to do
with music or love.
Sure.

28:29.292 --> 28:34.089
* And even the stars,
they burn *

28:34.130 --> 28:36.007
Lennon:
The lyrics in this song...
* Some even fall to the Earth *

28:36.049 --> 28:37.676
...definitely remind me
of my marriage.

28:37.717 --> 28:41.054
They remind me
of me pursuing music, as well.

28:41.096 --> 28:43.348
Before all this,
I was spending a lot of time

28:43.390 --> 28:46.685
playing at hotels,
dive bars, hot-dog stands --

28:46.726 --> 28:48.520
any gigs that would have me.

28:48.561 --> 28:50.146
And I'm not gonna give up.

28:50.188 --> 28:54.651
* I won't give up on us *
Yeah.

28:54.693 --> 28:56.611
I love Lennon so much...
* God knows
I'm tough enough *

28:56.653 --> 29:00.865
...because his voice
is high and so unique,

29:00.907 --> 29:02.701
and I think he's very special.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.121

You have an incredible range.

29:06.162 --> 29:07.539
Because my voice
is so different,

29:07.580 --> 29:09.249
I didn't believe in it fully,
I think.

29:09.290 --> 29:11.710

[chuckles] to believe in it.

There were just a couple of
spots where you're looking off.

29:16.756 --> 29:18.049
I think
you were kind of thinking about

29:18.091 --> 29:19.551
the next note
you were gonna sing.

29:19.592 --> 29:20.927
Yeah.
But I just want to feel that.

29:20.969 --> 29:22.262
I want to feel the emotion.

29:22.303 --> 29:23.722
I want to feel the performance
from you.

29:23.763 --> 29:25.682
Just kind of relax a little bit
and try less,

29:25.724 --> 29:27.892
because you're good enough
to try less

29:27.934 --> 29:29.144

29:39.362 --> 29:41.197

how to be a better artist,

has just shifted...

38:05.744 --> 38:07.537
Lookit. He's still crying.
[ Laughter ]

38:07.579 --> 38:08.872
Ever since I became a dad,

38:08.913 --> 38:10.665
I definitely cry a lot more
than I used to.

38:10.707 --> 38:12.042
All: Aww!
[ Laughs ]
It's hitting me more --

38:12.083 --> 38:15.420
Oh, my God.
I love you so much right now.

38:15.462 --> 38:16.629
[ Laughs ]

38:16.671 --> 38:18.506
[ Voice breaking ]
So, Lennon,

38:18.548 --> 38:21.176
I thought of you
as, like, the underdog.

38:21.217 --> 38:23.303
I -- Excuse me.

38:23.345 --> 38:25.263
All: Aww!

38:25.305 --> 38:27.307
Oh, my God.

38:27.349 --> 38:29.309
[ Cheers and applause ]

38:29.351 --> 38:34.147
I just felt you, like, being,
like, fully yourself,

38:34.189 --> 38:37.317
and it felt so moving to me.

38:37.359 --> 38:38.443
I don't know
why I keep crying.

38:38.485 --> 38:40.195
[ Laughs ]
I can't stop.

38:40.236 --> 38:41.821
[ Laughter ]

38:41.863 --> 38:43.740
Oh!
Reba's the mama bear.

38:43.782 --> 38:45.408
I knew Reba would have some.

38:45.450 --> 38:49.329
[ Laughter and applause ]

38:49.371 --> 38:50.997
Always prepared.
[ Laughter ]

38:51.039 --> 38:53.291
It felt so passionate
and so moving,

38:53.333 --> 38:55.502
and it really just got me.
[ Cheers and applause ]

38:55.543 --> 38:57.253
Um. I'm recovering now.

38:57.295 --> 39:00.465
Alexa, it was such a cool choice
picking that song,

39:00.507 --> 39:02.509
and you executed it
so flawlessly.

39:02.550 --> 39:04.260
It was perfect. Perfectly done.
Thank you.

39:04.302 --> 39:06.638
Thank you. Thank you, John.
[ Cheers and applause ]

39:06.680 --> 39:10.225
Julia, I was just stunned
by what you just did.

39:10.266 --> 39:11.726
It was such a revelation.

39:11.768 --> 39:13.978
A performance like that,
you can win "The Voice."

Reba:
Julia, at 13 years old,

39:17.816 --> 39:22.278
I was singing in barrooms,
honky-tonks, rodeos,

39:22.320 --> 39:23.446
any place we could.

39:23.488 --> 39:25.073
If I could have done
what you did,

39:25.115 --> 39:28.660
I might have been playing
a bigger bar or a bigger rodeo.

39:28.702 --> 39:29.953
[ Laughter ]

39:29.994 --> 39:31.287
You've done okay
in your career, Reba.

39:31.329 --> 39:33.123
I'd have gotten out of there
a lot quicker.

39:33.164 --> 39:34.791
[ Laughs ]
[ Cheers and applause ]

39:34.833 --> 39:36.501
And, Lennon,
I hope you realize

39:36.543 --> 39:38.837
that that's
the biggest compliment

39:38.878 --> 39:43.133
another artist could give you
is to sit there and cry,

39:43.174 --> 39:46.177
because you touched John
to his core.

39:46.219 --> 39:47.679
Thank you.
Daly: Thank you, coaches.

39:47.721 --> 39:49.848
Niall, you got
a big decision, buddy.

39:49.889 --> 39:51.766
I -- I just can't believe
what just happened.

39:51.808 --> 39:54.561
It's honestly my favorite moment
on "The Voice."

39:54.602 --> 39:56.688
These two crying says it all.

39:56.730 --> 39:59.858
And there's
no steals or saves left...
Yeah.

39:59.899 --> 40:02.193
...which makes this --
[ Scoffs ]

40:02.235 --> 40:03.695
I don't even have words
for it.

I can't help you, Niall.
Sorry.

Daly: Alexa!

40:17.876 --> 40:20.503
Alexa
is the most mind-blowing moment

40:20.545 --> 40:22.213
I've ever had on this show.

40:22.255 --> 40:24.090
A stunned Alexa!

40:24.132 --> 40:25.633
I chose Alexa as the winner...
Thank you so much.

40:25.675 --> 40:28.261
...because she is
a one-in-a-million talent.

40:29.596 --> 40:31.014
She could potentially win this.

40:31.056 --> 40:32.432
Julia, anything you want to say
to your coach?

40:32.474 --> 40:35.310
Yeah. I'm -- I'm just
so grateful to work with you.

And I know that I'm
just gonna continue on.

for every second we got to spend

40:53.787 --> 40:55.121
and for all
the love and support.

I can feel it.
You're an incredible talent.

You keep --
Keep going, man.

41:04.923 --> 41:08.009
from all three of them
was insane.

41:08.051 --> 41:10.595
I've never felt emotion like it.

41:10.637 --> 41:13.431
And that's exactly
what this show is about.

That was so good.
I felt your pain, my friend.

I was moved to tears.
Right.

Well, something's happening

are getting better and better.

we've had more four-chair turns

The knockouts, we've never seen
anything like it.

rather drastic...

Yeah.

...something
that's never been done

Remember me from "The Voice"?
