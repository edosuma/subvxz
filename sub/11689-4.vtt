WEBVTT

00:05.656 --> 00:08.023
And to the American
people who supported me

00:08.125 --> 00:10.359
with a majority of the popular vote,

00:10.779 --> 00:15.215
I promise you, this amazing
clean energy joint venture...

00:15.317 --> 00:17.684
You know, Wendy and I have
been meeting with surrogates.

00:17.786 --> 00:21.788
She is so excited about my sperm
being in another woman. It's weird.

00:21.890 --> 00:25.191
For the winds of economic change...

00:25.293 --> 00:27.728
they are a-blowing.

00:27.830 --> 00:30.096
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:30.198 --> 00:31.665
- Madam President.
- Thank you very much.

00:31.767 --> 00:33.734
Why is my hair all spinning around

00:33.836 --> 00:36.202
and these things, like
you, are doing nothin'?

00:36.304 --> 00:39.439
Apparently they shut the turbines off
if the wind speeds are too high.

00:39.541 --> 00:41.241
Is it too late to turn
them into oil derricks?

00:41.343 --> 00:43.009
Ma'am, I just got some really sad news.

00:43.111 --> 00:45.245
- Your mother's in the hospital.
- What?

00:45.347 --> 00:48.615
- It looks like a stroke.
- Again?

00:48.717 --> 00:50.751
We can 86 the meet-and-greet
with the engineers.

00:50.853 --> 00:53.253
- That's... that's no problem.
- Why?

00:53.355 --> 00:55.889
Because you need to rush
to your mother's bedside.

00:55.991 --> 00:58.759
- Yeah.
- All right. Okay. I'm...

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:12.908 --> 01:14.340
I hope Mee-Maw's okay.

01:14.443 --> 01:16.476
She's been at death's
door like five times,

01:16.578 --> 01:18.912
It's true.

01:19.014 --> 01:21.080
She's like that guy... that guy...

01:21.182 --> 01:22.982
- Lazarus.
- Rasputin.

01:23.084 --> 01:25.151
She seemed sweet when she
visited the White House.

01:25.253 --> 01:26.613
Really? Let me tell you something.

01:26.688 --> 01:29.423
After I lost my first
election for state senate,

01:29.525 --> 01:33.293
Mother says to me, "Well,
it's not your fault."

01:33.395 --> 01:35.094
It's just your toothy smile."

01:35.196 --> 01:37.798
Oh, my God. I love your smile.

01:37.900 --> 01:40.967
That's not the point. - Looks
weirder if you don't show your teeth.

01:41.069 --> 01:43.437
I just cannot believe
that has is happened

01:43.539 --> 01:45.405
in the middle of all of this.

01:45.507 --> 01:48.642
I know. I know. I'll tell you,
when my mom got ovarian cancer...

01:48.744 --> 01:49.812
Oh, call Kent.

01:49.813 --> 01:51.278
BALLOT HEARING
STATE SUPREME COURT, NV

01:51.279 --> 01:53.547
And that is why we have to stop

01:53.649 --> 01:56.349
this reckless meddling in
the electoral process.

01:56.452 --> 01:58.452
Stick to the legal deadline

01:58.554 --> 02:01.488
and certify the count as it stands.

02:01.590 --> 02:03.690
Thank you, Your Honors.

02:03.792 --> 02:05.592
May it please the court,

02:05.694 --> 02:08.662
there are many things that
we could all stand here

02:08.764 --> 02:10.931
and debate for hours on end.

02:11.032 --> 02:14.033
Is the sky blue? Is water wet?

02:14.135 --> 02:18.738
But isn't it far worse to
adhere to an arbitrary deadline

02:18.841 --> 02:22.108
rather than counting every valid vote?

02:24.212 --> 02:26.446
Jesus, an electoral protest?

02:26.548 --> 02:31.284
Wait a second, that's the O'Brien
nimrod from the recount table.

02:31.386 --> 02:33.987
A fake protest. That is classic O'Brien.

02:34.089 --> 02:35.856
It's such a scumbag move.

02:35.958 --> 02:37.678
...ho, ho, this endless
recount's got to go.

02:37.726 --> 02:39.659
Hey, hey, ho, ho...

02:39.761 --> 02:41.861
Yep, I'll raid petty cash.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.072
LADY OF GRACE HOSPITAL
SILVER, SPRING, MD

02:43.073 --> 02:45.064
Ma'am, you have to see
this dumb O'Brien tweet.

02:45.166 --> 02:47.100
"Another day wasting taxpayer dollars.

02:47.202 --> 02:49.569
Meyer plus windmills
cost money, do nothing."

02:49.671 --> 02:51.204
Well, that's on you, isn't it?

02:51.306 --> 02:53.272
See if you can spin something
right today, okay?

02:53.375 --> 02:56.009
- God.
- Ma'am, Amy's calling.

02:56.740 --> 02:58.311
Ame, hi. What's going on?

02:58.413 --> 03:00.614
Ma'am, I'm so, so sorry.

03:00.716 --> 03:02.883
- What? What happened?
- What?

03:02.985 --> 03:05.986
Your mother. I read on HuffPo
that she was in the hospital.

03:06.087 --> 03:09.022
Amy, I thought you were
talking about the recount.

03:09.124 --> 03:12.458
Don't ever, ever scare
me like that again.

03:12.561 --> 03:14.494
- I'm sorry.
- Just do whatever it takes

03:14.596 --> 03:16.396
to get these ballots counted, okay?

03:16.498 --> 03:18.131
My mother's gonna be fine. I gotta go.

03:18.233 --> 03:19.733
- God, we just...
- Okay.

03:19.835 --> 03:23.269
Oh, wow. Everyone's here.

03:23.371 --> 03:26.006
This is your temporary mobile oval.

03:26.107 --> 03:28.374
I'm sorry, is there a kettle
or clothing steamer in here?

03:28.476 --> 03:30.944
- No.
- Okay, this is gonna be quite the day.

03:31.046 --> 03:32.646
So where's my mother?

03:32.748 --> 03:34.480
- She's down the hall to the right.
- Okay.

03:34.583 --> 03:36.416
- And Andrew's here.
- What?

03:36.518 --> 03:38.418
- What?
- At Catherine's request.

03:38.520 --> 03:40.040
But I made sure he had nowhere to sit.

03:40.088 --> 03:41.821
You are good people, Sue.

03:42.243 --> 03:44.090
Andrew.

03:44.192 --> 03:46.560
Wow, hi. You got here quick.

03:46.662 --> 03:48.327
Catherine called me. You were away.

03:48.430 --> 03:50.030
Yeah, serving the country.

03:50.131 --> 03:51.464
- I'm sorry about your mother.
- Thank you.

03:51.567 --> 03:53.132
Oh, this is Monica.

03:53.234 --> 03:55.068
A pleasure to meet you, Madam President.

03:55.170 --> 03:56.937
My thoughts are so with you right now.

03:57.039 --> 03:58.504
Thank you so much.

03:58.607 --> 04:00.473
- You brought a date.
- I don't know her.

04:00.576 --> 04:02.896
Monica and I are seeing one another.
She's part of my life.

04:03.152 --> 04:04.978
She writes books on homemaking.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.246
- Blogs about entertaining.
- I do know her.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.148
She does some of the
local morning shows.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.651
- WBAL has her on during the holidays.
- Oh, my God.

04:11.753 --> 04:14.888
Okay, sweetie, the president does not
want to hear my resume right now.

04:14.990 --> 04:17.923
She's a smart one. You can maybe
pick up something from her.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.094
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:20.095 --> 04:22.629
I just want to say my wife is obsessed
with your spiced eggnog..

04:22.731 --> 04:25.331
- We drink it year-round.
- It makes a really yummy ice cream.

04:25.433 --> 04:26.833
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

04:30.371 --> 04:33.406
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, Mom.

04:33.508 --> 04:35.041
Oh, Catherine, this is my...

04:35.143 --> 04:37.577
- Hey, Cat.
- Thank you so much for coming.

04:37.679 --> 04:39.045
You two know each other?

04:39.147 --> 04:40.814
We've all been hanging out a bunch.

04:40.916 --> 04:42.616
Yeah, Monnie gave me this sweater.

04:42.718 --> 04:44.417
No, I definitely didn't
give you that sweater.

04:44.519 --> 04:45.986
- Not that color.
- No, I didn't.

04:46.088 --> 04:47.887
I'm sorry, I think she's
talking about me.

04:47.990 --> 04:50.590
She calls me "Monnie."
Sounds like "mommy."

04:50.965 --> 04:52.726
Well, okay.

04:55.097 --> 04:57.998
- I can't take this music, okay?
- Yeah, please.

04:58.100 --> 05:01.735
I mean, the campaign's over. I don't have
to pretend to like country music anymore.

05:01.837 --> 05:04.070
This is Tim McGraw. It's
Mee-Maw's favorite song.

05:04.172 --> 05:06.405
What? No. Mee-Maw's favorite song

05:06.508 --> 05:08.942
is whatever is playing in the
background at Neiman Marcus.

05:09.044 --> 05:11.044
Please turn it off, okay?

05:11.146 --> 05:13.379
Mom, you should say hi to her.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.548
Honey, if I wanted to talk
to an unconscious person,

05:15.651 --> 05:17.283
I'd book myself on Charlie Rose.

05:20.789 --> 05:23.023
What happened to her nails?

05:23.125 --> 05:26.425
Looks like she's been diggin'
for potatoes or something.

05:26.528 --> 05:28.928
Why are you even worried
about her hands right now?

05:29.031 --> 05:30.630
That is so not important.

05:30.732 --> 05:34.233
- Catherine, Mother loves her hands.
- Yeah.

05:34.335 --> 05:37.403
She always wore dishwashing
gloves when she gave me my bath.

05:37.505 --> 05:38.872
Which is why I don't do dishes.

05:38.974 --> 05:41.074
I just now realized that.

05:41.176 --> 05:43.810
Hello, Madam President.

05:43.912 --> 05:45.344
I'm Dr. Mirpuri.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.480
- Dr. Mir...
- Mirpuri.

05:47.582 --> 05:50.050
"Mir-piri." Okay. How is she doing?

05:50.152 --> 05:52.518
I'm afraid it's quite dire.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.988
All brain function has ceased.

05:56.792 --> 05:59.225
So she's not gonna bounce back?

05:59.327 --> 06:02.328
I'm afraid she'll need
to stay on life support

06:02.430 --> 06:04.263
until she expires.

06:05.667 --> 06:07.100
Did you still want to do her nails?

06:07.202 --> 06:08.835
- Oh, yes, I do.
- Okay.

06:09.035 --> 06:09.790
HOSPITAL CAFETERIA, 1ST FLOOR

06:09.791 --> 06:11.137
No, we're not hiring that woman.

06:11.239 --> 06:13.173
It was just a cold sore, honey.

06:13.274 --> 06:15.374
I don't want to pay 40
grand for a herpes baby.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.376
- Oh, hey, Debralee?
- Yes, hi.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.179
Mike, yes. Nice to meet you.

06:19.280 --> 06:21.047
Wendy. - Debralee. Hi,
Wendy. So nice to meet you.

06:21.149 --> 06:23.149
- You want anything?
- I'm good. Thank you, though.

06:23.251 --> 06:25.484
I just had a kombucha on my way over.

06:25.587 --> 06:27.520
- Okay, so I'll just dive on in...
- That'd be great.

06:27.622 --> 06:29.355
And give you guys a
little background on me.

06:29.457 --> 06:31.758
You already know I've carried
three babies to term.

06:31.860 --> 06:35.061
Keep everything organic.
I exercise every day.

06:35.163 --> 06:37.363
I don't drink or smoke and I never have.

06:37.465 --> 06:39.099
That's amazing.

06:39.201 --> 06:42.736
I mean, that's exactly
what we're looking for.

06:42.838 --> 06:44.403
Praise Jesus.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.405
Are y'all Christians?

06:46.507 --> 06:48.574
Yes... yes.

06:48.676 --> 06:52.445
I mean, a lot of people think
that I'm Jewish, but that... no.

06:53.849 --> 06:55.715
What church y'all go to?

06:55.817 --> 06:57.177
- Our Lady...
- Of the Holy Womb...

06:57.219 --> 06:59.452
- ...of the Holy Womb.
- ...Womb of Jesus.

06:59.554 --> 07:02.288
It's a small congregation,
but it's fierce.

07:02.390 --> 07:04.523
It's holy.

07:04.626 --> 07:06.726
Okay, Emily's working on her nails now.

07:06.828 --> 07:09.162
- Good. Dark?
- Excuse me, Madam President.

07:09.264 --> 07:11.397
Your mother was a bit vague on the DNR.

07:11.499 --> 07:13.399
- Okay.
- So it will come down to you.

07:13.501 --> 07:15.334
- Praying for a miracle.
- Please don't.

07:15.436 --> 07:16.636
Okay.

07:17.785 --> 07:18.638
Okay.

07:18.740 --> 07:21.207
Well, Dr. McCurry...

07:21.309 --> 07:24.043
- Mirpuri.
- Yes, that's what I said.

07:24.146 --> 07:28.114
So what does that entail, you
know, the pulling of the plug?

07:28.216 --> 07:30.650
There's not really a plug.

07:30.752 --> 07:34.020
What we're talking about requires
removing the ventilator tube.

07:34.122 --> 07:37.123
And then as her organs begin to fail...

07:37.225 --> 07:39.692
Okay, I'm gonna have to sit
down for just a minute,

07:39.795 --> 07:41.661
if that's all right.

07:41.763 --> 07:44.030
We would be tracking her vitals...

07:44.132 --> 07:46.833
It's okay, Catherine. It's okay.

07:48.379 --> 07:50.436
Oh, wow, that is loud, honey.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.305
That's loud.

07:52.407 --> 07:55.374
Oh, "Stephen Hawking" here is
indisposed, so I'll just...

07:55.476 --> 07:58.077
- Marjorie, can you help me with this?
- Yes, ma'am.

07:58.180 --> 07:59.946
I just want to assure
you, Madam President,

08:00.048 --> 08:02.315
we would do everything in
our power to ensure...

08:02.417 --> 08:04.684
Yeah, just a sec. Something's
pressing here. Kent!

08:04.786 --> 08:06.953
- I'm sorry, didn't mean to intrude.
- No, no, no.

08:07.055 --> 08:08.855
I chose a parabolic path
deliberately out of earshot.

08:08.957 --> 08:10.456
It's fine.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.826
What's up?

08:12.928 --> 08:17.496
I just needed to get a break from
the Hindu Grim Reaper out there.

08:26.407 --> 08:28.975
I don't know if this
provides any solace,

08:29.077 --> 08:32.778
but ever since your mother's
health setback was announced,

08:32.881 --> 08:36.448
there has been an
outpouring of support...

08:38.220 --> 08:39.953
...that has driven up your favorables.

08:40.054 --> 08:43.957
I'm talking about pulling
the plug on my mother here.

08:44.058 --> 08:46.492
How is half a percentage
point in the polls

08:46.594 --> 08:48.427
supposed to sweeten that shit biscuit?

08:48.529 --> 08:50.796
- More like double digits.
- Really?

08:52.767 --> 08:54.700
But just out of curiosity,

08:54.802 --> 08:57.904
if I were to, you know...

08:59.765 --> 09:01.807
would that end?

09:01.910 --> 09:05.044
There is a possibility
of a shorter-lived,

09:05.146 --> 09:08.314
but numerically greater outpouring...

09:08.416 --> 09:11.150
if you will, a "death bump."

09:11.253 --> 09:13.186
- Really?
- Really.

09:16.992 --> 09:20.493
Well, that is some wild and heavy stuff.

09:20.595 --> 09:21.995
Indeed.

09:22.097 --> 09:25.098
Yeah. I got some real
soul-searching to do.

09:40.181 --> 09:41.881
Now, I have been in
Washington a long time

09:41.983 --> 09:43.616
and I thought I had seen everything,

09:43.718 --> 09:46.485
but the insensitivity
shown by Senator O'Brien

09:46.587 --> 09:51.665
clearly demonstrates that this man does
not possess the judgment and dignity...

09:51.666 --> 09:52.746
True statesman right there.

09:52.794 --> 09:56.529
Okay, so now what I need
is a quiet place to think

09:56.631 --> 09:58.311
that doesn't have Mike's
stupid face in it.

09:58.400 --> 10:00.033
I can turn around, ma'am.

10:00.135 --> 10:01.615
There's a chapel on the fourth floor.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.169
We can make sure it's
cleared out for you.

10:03.271 --> 10:04.537
Okay, yeah.

10:04.639 --> 10:06.605
- Ma'am?
- What?

10:06.707 --> 10:09.342
Those we have loved cannot be lost

10:09.444 --> 10:11.877
because they are always a part of us.

10:11.980 --> 10:14.280
Thank you, Ben, and whoever
wrote those words.

10:14.382 --> 10:16.082
- Look what I found.
- Too late.

10:16.184 --> 10:18.151
- Of course.
- I recognize those words.

10:18.253 --> 10:21.754
They were in the card your wife sent
me when my cat Fibonacci passed.

10:21.856 --> 10:22.989
I found them soothing.

10:23.091 --> 10:25.058
Hey, hey, ho, ho.

10:25.160 --> 10:26.960
This endless recount's got to go.

10:27.062 --> 10:29.395
- God, that's a great chant.
- Just catchy.

10:29.497 --> 10:31.431
Jesus, lose the fucking badge, man.

10:31.532 --> 10:33.333
Jesus Christ. All
right, show me the art.

10:33.435 --> 10:35.401
Okay, we got "Count Totes the Votes."

10:35.503 --> 10:36.869
What is that? What's "totes"?

10:36.972 --> 10:39.272
Totes, like all. Count all the votes.

10:39.374 --> 10:42.241
You guys have one job to do,
that is to rally the crowd

10:42.344 --> 10:45.278
with your pro-POTUS signs and get
your camera-unfriendly faces on TV.

10:45.380 --> 10:48.348
Yes. - You can't put a
Jonah Ryan on TV like that.

10:48.450 --> 10:50.683
18 to 34-year-old women are
gonna be distracted by that.

10:50.785 --> 10:53.819
The only thing that women
18-34 are gonna do

10:53.921 --> 10:56.589
when they see you on camera
is file a restraining order.

10:56.691 --> 10:58.624
So make some fuckin' noise, dummies.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.059
What the fuck are you smiling at?

11:00.161 --> 11:01.394
I'm just happy to be here.

11:01.496 --> 11:02.728
Unbelievable.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.131
What do we want? To get
the votes counted.

11:05.233 --> 11:08.734
When do we want it? Hopefully
before the deadline.

11:08.855 --> 11:10.388
SLOANE FAMILY MEMORIAL CHAPEL

11:10.389 --> 11:12.972
- Do you pray?
- A lot.

11:13.074 --> 11:14.640
What do you pray for?

11:14.742 --> 11:17.377
You, you know...

11:21.116 --> 11:23.016
Do you want... you maybe want to try it?

11:23.589 --> 11:24.717
Sure.

11:24.819 --> 11:26.499
You know, what the hell?
We're here, right?

11:26.554 --> 11:28.621
- Okay, all right.
- Yeah.

11:28.723 --> 11:31.024
Okay.

11:31.126 --> 11:33.426
God, I...

11:36.398 --> 11:38.731
I... I just... I'm...

11:38.833 --> 11:40.900
"O Lord God, it's me, Selina."

11:41.002 --> 11:44.137
O Lord God. It's me, Selina...

11:44.239 --> 11:46.072
Grant me wisdom and strength.

11:46.174 --> 11:48.741
Give us Your comforting presence...
I've got it now.

11:48.843 --> 11:50.576
- I've got it.
- Okay, yep.

11:50.678 --> 11:54.080
Lord God, please ease my
mother's pain and suffering.

11:54.182 --> 11:56.482
Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord.

11:56.584 --> 11:59.618
Ease her passing. Ease it all.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.488
- Yes.
- Ease it down the...

12:03.312 --> 12:04.890
the...

12:04.992 --> 12:09.262
Lord, let her daughter,
Thy humble servant,

12:09.364 --> 12:13.966
be the first woman elected
President of the United States.

12:14.069 --> 12:17.170
Please, this is so much to bear.

12:17.272 --> 12:19.138
Oh, it is, Lord. It is.

12:19.240 --> 12:21.907
- Hear my prayer.
- Hear her prayer.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.544
- Lift me up.
- Lift her up, Lord.

12:24.645 --> 12:27.780
No, I mean actually lift me up 'cause
my heel is stuck in this thing.

12:27.882 --> 12:30.616
Yeah, I got it.

12:33.669 --> 12:34.987
Okay, just so you know,

12:35.090 --> 12:36.655
after the ventilator is removed,

12:36.757 --> 12:38.491
there might be some coughing.

12:38.593 --> 12:40.759
It's reflexive. It's not
a sign that she's aware

12:40.861 --> 12:43.096
- or suffering in any way.
- Okay.

12:43.198 --> 12:45.864
Okay, why don't I give you
a moment to say goodbye?

12:45.967 --> 12:49.168
Oh, you mean now? What...

13:05.620 --> 13:07.820
Well, that's much better.

13:17.398 --> 13:19.798
Well, Mother...

13:20.868 --> 13:23.503
I just want you to...

13:31.679 --> 13:35.114
those you loved cannot be lost

13:35.216 --> 13:37.850
because they are always a part of you.

13:37.952 --> 13:40.353
So...

13:44.259 --> 13:46.792
Okay.

13:47.895 --> 13:49.562
- Ma'am?
- Yeah?

13:49.664 --> 13:51.830
Sorry, it can wait till later.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.533
- No, no, come in.
- You sure?

13:53.635 --> 13:54.733
Yeah, come in.

13:54.835 --> 13:58.737
Yeah, Doctor Mir...? Can... yeah.

13:58.839 --> 14:01.307
Okay, Nicole, you can
go ahead and begin.

14:01.409 --> 14:03.569
Ma'am, I don't really think
we should be here for this.

14:03.611 --> 14:05.444
No, no, you've got to stay.
You're gonna stay.

14:05.547 --> 14:08.013
Okay, she's just gonna
remove the ventilator.

14:08.115 --> 14:09.615
Okay.

14:18.117 --> 14:19.758
What...?

14:19.860 --> 14:22.828
So in your experience,

14:22.930 --> 14:26.566
how long does this sort
of thing carry on?

14:26.668 --> 14:28.834
- Usually minutes.
- Okay.

14:28.936 --> 14:31.370
I have seen hours.

14:31.472 --> 14:33.372
Days are very rare.

14:33.474 --> 14:34.807
Oh, well, that's not gonna work

14:34.909 --> 14:40.145
because for me with
my schedule and life.

14:41.012 --> 14:41.947
Jesus Christ.

14:44.091 --> 14:46.552
Turn that off!

14:50.831 --> 14:52.991
Okay, no...

14:54.189 --> 14:56.362
She's gone, Madam President.

14:56.464 --> 14:58.497
- Yeah, okay.
- My condolences.

14:58.600 --> 15:02.034
- Can I just have a moment?
- Yes, of course. Absolutely.

15:15.483 --> 15:17.216
Well, why don't you check your phones?

15:17.318 --> 15:20.286
Sounds like you shoplifted
a bunch of vibrators.

15:20.388 --> 15:23.055
The Nevada State Supreme Court

15:23.157 --> 15:26.091
issued a temporary
stay of certification.

15:26.193 --> 15:28.827
The count will continue.

15:28.929 --> 15:32.298
- Oh, my prayer worked, right?!
- Maybe.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.267
Wow, you wanted help
from above, here it is.

15:34.369 --> 15:36.469
Yeah. It's fantastic.

15:36.571 --> 15:39.805
Mom? What's going on? What's
everyone cheering about?

15:39.907 --> 15:42.308
- Is Mee-Maw better?
- Catherine.

15:42.410 --> 15:43.976
I thought you were here.

15:44.078 --> 15:45.244
No, I went to get coffee.

15:45.346 --> 15:46.879
I asked if you wanted anything.

15:46.981 --> 15:49.515
No, I didn't hear you say that.

15:49.617 --> 15:52.117
She's gone?

15:52.219 --> 15:54.186
You pulled the plug without me?

15:54.289 --> 15:58.090
It wasn't a plug. It was a
ventilator tube that they just...

16:00.055 --> 16:00.993
Oh, darling.

16:01.095 --> 16:02.795
Oh, honey, no, no, no, no.

16:02.897 --> 16:05.097
Mee-Maw didn't know you
weren't here, honey.

16:05.199 --> 16:07.300
She's brain dead.

16:07.402 --> 16:09.802
Baby doll, she was brain dead.

16:10.879 --> 16:12.371
We got good news

16:12.473 --> 16:15.174
about Nevada.

16:15.276 --> 16:17.643
Wait, what?

16:17.745 --> 16:20.846
We got good news from Nevada.

16:27.689 --> 16:28.788
Mom?

16:32.226 --> 16:35.394
- I'm gonna step outside.
- Okay.

16:35.872 --> 16:38.616
SMALL JOY HILL, MARYLAND

16:38.816 --> 16:42.034
Mother would never let
me use the good piano.

16:42.136 --> 16:45.938
I always had to take my lessons
on the shitty upright in the den.

16:47.839 --> 16:48.674
Oh, you know what?

16:48.776 --> 16:51.377
That would be a good
story for the eulogy.

16:51.479 --> 16:53.846
Mom, why would you want to paint
Mee-Maw in such a negative light?

16:53.948 --> 16:56.415
Oh, Catherine, Thomas fucking Kinkade

16:56.517 --> 16:58.584
couldn't paint Mee-Maw
in a positive light.

16:59.814 --> 17:00.753
Oh, my God.

17:00.855 --> 17:02.788
You never knew Daddy.

17:02.890 --> 17:06.358
He was so sweet. Mee-Maw
blamed me for his death.

17:06.441 --> 17:08.026
What?

17:08.127 --> 17:10.762
I think that's probably
your interpretation of it.

17:10.865 --> 17:13.665
Oh, Catherine, you have no idea

17:13.768 --> 17:15.867
what it was like to be the only daughter

17:15.970 --> 17:18.002
of a pathological narcissist.

17:18.105 --> 17:21.574
I mean, all this woman did was
criticize me or ignore me.

17:22.366 --> 17:24.108
I'm gonna go to bed.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.810
Okay, 'night.

17:28.383 --> 17:31.517
Ma'am, your mother's attorney
George Huntzinger is here.

17:31.619 --> 17:33.486
Okay. Uncle George.

17:33.588 --> 17:35.354
Selina.

17:35.456 --> 17:36.955
Or should I say Madam President?

17:37.057 --> 17:38.624
Oh, my goodness.

17:38.726 --> 17:40.092
I'm so happy to see you.

17:40.194 --> 17:42.495
You know what? You were
always my favorite

17:42.597 --> 17:44.029
of all of Mother's lawyers.

17:44.131 --> 17:45.865
- You're too kind.
- No, it's true.

17:45.966 --> 17:48.401
So we need to get you the keys

17:48.503 --> 17:50.436
to Mother's summer house
for the appraisers.

17:50.538 --> 17:52.204
Right over here? Yeah.

17:52.306 --> 17:54.106
She was the most darling woman.

17:54.208 --> 17:56.509
Yes, she certainly was in a sense, yeah.

17:56.611 --> 17:58.377
- Here's the key, sir.
- There we go.

17:58.479 --> 18:00.519
Ma'am, we really need to
return to funeral planning.

18:00.581 --> 18:02.448
- Yes.
- So many people outside.

18:02.550 --> 18:05.070
I feared I might have to start
driving over them to get in here.

18:05.119 --> 18:07.219
Really? Protesters?

18:07.321 --> 18:09.588
This country's just lost
its sense of decency.

18:09.690 --> 18:11.557
- Well, they're animals.
- No, no. Heavens, no.

18:11.659 --> 18:14.393
- They're well-wishers.
- Really?

18:14.495 --> 18:16.228
Yeah.

18:16.330 --> 18:18.330
People are wishing me well?

18:18.433 --> 18:21.867
Well, of course they are.
You're in mourning.

18:21.969 --> 18:24.169
Oh, right. Yeah.

18:26.407 --> 18:28.974
Thank you so much. You're too kind.

18:29.076 --> 18:30.242
I appreciate it.

18:30.344 --> 18:32.010
Oh, my goodness. I feel like a bride.

18:32.112 --> 18:35.414
A sad bride because, of course,
this is a day of grief.

18:35.516 --> 18:39.485
Her brain was quite damaged
for quite a long time.

18:39.587 --> 18:41.520
I love you.

18:41.622 --> 18:45.223
There are so many friendly
and diverse faces here.

18:45.326 --> 18:47.626
And I wish that Mother were alive

18:47.728 --> 18:50.695
to see this on her property.

18:50.696 --> 18:52.233
NEVADA ELECTION BOARD

18:52.234 --> 18:53.222
O'Brien.

18:53.223 --> 18:54.700
Ms. Brookheimer, how goes the count?

18:54.802 --> 18:58.170
Oh, it's great if you want a bloated
booze bag to be our next president.

18:58.272 --> 19:01.507
- O'Brien.
- So O'Brien's a lush?

19:01.609 --> 19:03.241
Did Eleanor Roosevelt eat pussy?

19:04.739 --> 19:05.478
Oh, Jesus.

19:05.580 --> 19:08.647
Oh, God, I'm sorry. It's the way
we talk in the White House.

19:08.749 --> 19:10.549
I'm not even aware I'm doing it anymore.

19:10.651 --> 19:12.718
Wow. I mean, you seem so...

19:12.820 --> 19:15.253
- and then...
- Hey, it may not even be true.

19:15.356 --> 19:18.223
Did she eat pussy or did she just fingerbang
her way down Pennsylvania Avenue?

19:18.325 --> 19:19.925
Fuck my mouth. I'm doing it again.

19:20.027 --> 19:23.729
Jiminy Cricket. Wow.

19:23.831 --> 19:26.231
Damn it. Apparently our
born-again surrogate

19:26.333 --> 19:29.702
is super against DNR, so when
POTUS pulled the plug on MOTUS,

19:29.804 --> 19:31.871
she started having second thoughts.

19:31.973 --> 19:36.041
Did you explain to her that there is no
scientific evidence of a higher power?

19:37.344 --> 19:39.011
How long has this yogurt been in here?

19:39.113 --> 19:40.479
Make yourself at home, Mike.

19:40.581 --> 19:42.581
Don't eat the bananas. They're wax.

19:42.683 --> 19:44.650
- Copy that.
- Shit news from Nevada.

19:44.752 --> 19:47.887
What? - The new votes are
tilting heavily toward O'Brien.

19:47.989 --> 19:51.323
Apparently most of them
are military absentees.

19:51.425 --> 19:55.895
Of course. Fort Dutton.
It all makes sense.

19:55.997 --> 19:57.830
No, no, no. That doesn't make any sense.

19:57.932 --> 20:00.465
Nevada is my state. I'm
gonna be president.

20:00.568 --> 20:03.335
I'm gonna be the first
elected lady president.

20:03.437 --> 20:06.138
I'm gonna have a lovely inauguration.
Billy Joel is gonna sing.

20:06.240 --> 20:09.341
So you guys have to stop the recount.

20:09.443 --> 20:11.443
- I'm sorry, what?
- Stop the count.

20:11.546 --> 20:13.679
- Shut up, Gary. Ma'am, we can't.
- I don't care.

20:13.781 --> 20:16.782
The train has very publically left the
station and derailed at high speed.

20:16.884 --> 20:20.352
You got to stop the count. - Ma'am,
this would look like a size-14 flip-flop.

20:20.454 --> 20:22.588
- We really can't...
- I don't give a fuck!

20:22.690 --> 20:25.591
You're gonna cancel this recount
like Anne Frank's bat mitzvah.

20:25.693 --> 20:28.961
Yeah, I'm on it, though I think
the DJ already spent the deposit.

20:29.063 --> 20:32.698
I'm on it right... yeah, Amy. Yeah.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.400
I'm tired of losing things!

20:35.502 --> 20:38.270
We would like to file
a motion to exclude

20:38.372 --> 20:40.272
all pending ballots from the recount.

20:42.276 --> 20:44.910
Ms. Collins, you do realize
that what you're saying

20:45.012 --> 20:48.080
is in diametric opposition to the
case you presented yesterday?

20:48.182 --> 20:52.417
If the deadline has passed, why is
the recount allowed to continue?

20:52.519 --> 20:56.521
Objection, Your Honor.
The count must continue.

20:56.624 --> 20:59.058
Did we tell "Huey, Dewey, and Rapey"

20:59.159 --> 21:02.595
that it's "Stop the Count" now
and not "Count Every Vote"?

21:02.697 --> 21:04.830
Shit.

21:04.932 --> 21:08.033
Count every vote. Count every vote.

21:08.135 --> 21:11.070
Count every vote. Count every vote.

21:11.171 --> 21:13.171
Doesn't he work for O'Brien?

21:13.273 --> 21:16.374
No. Jesus. Come on, Richard, no.

21:16.477 --> 21:19.511
- Count every vote!
- Jonah!

21:19.614 --> 21:21.546
- Count every vote!
- Richard!

21:21.649 --> 21:23.649
Stop protesting, you idiots!

21:23.751 --> 21:28.153
- NEVADA RECOUNT CONTINUES
- Count every vote! Count every vote!

21:28.255 --> 21:31.523
Maybe I'll get assassinated.

21:32.008 --> 21:35.862
TRINITY EPISCOPAL CHURCH
KENWOOD, MD

21:35.863 --> 21:38.363
Selina, Selina, Selina.

21:38.465 --> 21:41.433
- What?
- Life takes so many turns.

21:41.535 --> 21:44.169
Yeah. - I just want you to
know where I'm coming from.

21:44.271 --> 21:47.706
- All right.
- Monica, she's sweet,

21:47.808 --> 21:50.042
she's lovely, she's short-term.

21:50.144 --> 21:53.245
She's something to get me through
the long nights for now.

21:53.347 --> 21:56.348
Andrew, you know that we're
at a funeral, right?

21:56.450 --> 21:58.917
- We're not at Club Med.
- In here...

21:59.020 --> 22:00.619
it's always been you.

22:04.368 --> 22:05.423
In a church.

22:05.526 --> 22:07.993
- Madam President.
- Oh, Tom.

22:08.095 --> 22:10.262
- I'm so sorry for your loss.
- Thank you very much.

22:10.364 --> 22:12.330
Thanks for being here, Tom.
I appreciate it.

22:12.432 --> 22:14.466
I see that Charlie Baird is here.

22:14.568 --> 22:16.635
Yes. Yeah, he flew in this morning.

22:16.737 --> 22:19.905
So who's fisting the American
economy while he's here?

22:20.007 --> 22:21.740
Really, Tom?

22:21.842 --> 22:23.676
My apologies, Madam President.

22:23.778 --> 22:25.544
- God.
- Charlie.

22:25.646 --> 22:27.112
- Tommy.
- Yeah?

22:27.214 --> 22:28.947
- Ma'am.
- Oh, hang on two seconds.

22:29.050 --> 22:30.916
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:31.018 --> 22:32.718
- Hi, Gary.
- Hi.

22:32.820 --> 22:36.388
Wow, your ex, not afraid to
mix business with mourning.

22:36.490 --> 22:38.557
Oh, yeah. How soon after meeting you

22:38.659 --> 22:40.659
did he ask you to invest
in his latest venture?

22:40.761 --> 22:42.895
- 17 seconds. - Really?
- I timed it.

22:42.997 --> 22:46.765
Some can't-lose scheme about the
third largest hotel chain in Brazil.

22:46.867 --> 22:48.567
- "Can't lose."
- Can't lose.

22:48.669 --> 22:51.070
Got to see if I still have my wallet.

22:51.172 --> 22:52.905
- Ma'am, sorry to interrupt.
- Yeah?

22:53.007 --> 22:54.673
- The eulogy is all set.
- Okay.

22:54.775 --> 22:57.042
- And I added the good piano anecdote.
- Perfect.

22:57.144 --> 22:59.812
- I don't know if that was the best...
- No, it works.

22:59.914 --> 23:01.680
Andrew.

23:01.782 --> 23:04.016
Can anybody get in on this Brazil thing?

23:04.118 --> 23:05.483
I got a baby to pay for.

23:05.586 --> 23:07.652
Please let me play the Tim McGraw song.

23:07.755 --> 23:09.154
Okay? I have it all cued up.

23:09.256 --> 23:10.455
Seriously, Catherine,

23:10.557 --> 23:12.490
this is a funeral, not a NASCAR race.

23:12.593 --> 23:14.226
I don't have the time
for this right now.

23:14.328 --> 23:16.161
When do you have the
time, then, Mom? When?

23:16.263 --> 23:19.164
Okay? Because you
don't like Tim McGraw,

23:19.266 --> 23:21.533
then nobody is supposed
to like Tim McGraw.

23:21.635 --> 23:23.802
Catherine, you are forbidden

23:23.904 --> 23:26.972
from saying the words
"Tim McGraw" ever again.

23:27.074 --> 23:29.174
Unbelievable. Mee-Maw
was so right about you.

23:29.276 --> 23:31.576
What is that supposed to mean? What
is that... - Pardon me, ma'am.

23:31.678 --> 23:33.678
Pardon me. Could I borrow
you for a minute? - What?

23:33.714 --> 23:36.048
I've just been kibitzing
with the Qatari ambassador,

23:36.150 --> 23:39.618
Mohammed bin Nasser bin
Khalifa Al Jaffar.

23:39.720 --> 23:41.120
Please don't have him
sign the guest book.

23:41.222 --> 23:43.188
Yeah, he comes bringing
a message from China.

23:43.290 --> 23:44.957
Why would China go through Qatar?

23:45.059 --> 23:46.591
Qataris love to insert themselves.

23:46.693 --> 23:49.128
- They're wet-fingered.
- They're into ass play?

23:49.230 --> 23:53.632
No, they have a gift for sensing
prevailing political winds.

23:53.734 --> 23:55.467
I'll bet they're into ass play, too.

23:55.569 --> 23:57.335
Those people that you bring in,

23:57.437 --> 24:00.272
as they bring in people,
you get a piece of that.

24:00.374 --> 24:01.774
I get a piece of that.

24:01.876 --> 24:04.743
In perpetuity.

24:04.845 --> 24:07.846
- Madam President.
- Mr. Ambassador.

24:07.948 --> 24:09.915
So I understand you
have a message for me.

24:10.017 --> 24:13.152
What I say to you is in the
strictest of confidence.

24:13.254 --> 24:15.788
The sanctions you have threatened
against our friends in China

24:15.890 --> 24:17.923
may undermine their very fragile economy

24:18.025 --> 24:19.792
at a most inopportune moment.

24:19.894 --> 24:24.396
But in exchange for easing
the economic pressure,

24:24.498 --> 24:29.034
they would be open to indirect talks.

24:29.136 --> 24:32.671
What is on the table?

24:32.773 --> 24:34.239
Oh, everything.

24:34.341 --> 24:37.109
From climate change to human rights.

24:37.211 --> 24:38.610
We shall be in touch.

24:38.712 --> 24:41.446
Thank you, Ambassador Al...

24:42.817 --> 24:44.449
Okay.

24:45.886 --> 24:48.120
Well, that was mysterious, right?

24:48.222 --> 24:50.155
- Ma'am. - Yeah?
- They're ready for you.

24:50.257 --> 24:51.556
Let's get this show on the road.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.959
We are gathered together today

24:54.061 --> 24:56.862
to remember the life of
Catherine Calvert Eaton.

24:56.964 --> 25:00.098
This China thing is like
legacy material, right?

25:00.843 --> 25:03.735
Nobel Peace Prize material.

25:10.978 --> 25:12.711
What?

25:12.813 --> 25:14.980
I'll tell you after.

25:15.082 --> 25:16.648
Tell me now.

25:17.238 --> 25:19.384
Karen couldn't stop the count.

25:19.955 --> 25:21.553
We officially lost Nevada,

25:21.655 --> 25:23.922
so we're gonna have to
fight it out in Congress.

25:24.024 --> 25:26.524
- And...
- And what?

25:26.626 --> 25:28.493
What else?

25:28.595 --> 25:32.197
With all the new votes
going to O'Brien, we've...

25:33.533 --> 25:35.334
Kent.

25:35.435 --> 25:37.602
We lost the popular vote.

25:37.704 --> 25:39.537
Oh, God.

25:45.179 --> 25:46.979
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

25:47.081 --> 25:48.780
Sorry for your loss.

25:48.883 --> 25:50.482
Yeah.

25:50.584 --> 25:52.550
Okay.

25:55.222 --> 25:57.389
I grieve with thee.

25:57.491 --> 25:59.858
Oh, thank you, Kent.

25:59.960 --> 26:03.628
As we begin our service, we will
now hear from her daughter,

26:03.730 --> 26:05.764
President Selina Meyer.

26:15.776 --> 26:20.279
My mother had a good piano.

26:23.384 --> 26:25.550
I'm sorry.

26:25.652 --> 26:29.187
It's just all sort of
hitting me right now.

26:31.725 --> 26:33.959
I have lost...

26:36.063 --> 26:37.930
so much.

26:42.369 --> 26:45.870
I'm sorry. I can't. I can't.

26:45.973 --> 26:50.542
Catherine, play the Tim McGraw thing.

27:15.702 --> 27:19.938
Just not fair. This is just not fair.

27:44.664 --> 27:47.732
- A very moving eulogy.
- Oh, thank you, Geo

27:47.834 --> 27:50.702
When you feel up to it, you and
Catherine and I should sit down

27:50.804 --> 27:53.938
and discuss the estate and
how you fit into all of it.

27:54.041 --> 27:55.940
How I fit into the estate?

27:56.043 --> 28:00.078
It's not uncommon for an
inheritance to skip a generation

28:00.180 --> 28:03.748
and your mother decided to leave the
bulk of her estate to Catherine.

28:03.850 --> 28:05.183
The bulk?

28:05.285 --> 28:07.552
- It'll all be fine.
- Yes.

28:08.485 --> 28:10.322
- Great speech.
- Thank you.

28:10.424 --> 28:11.689
- Love that song.
- Okay.

28:11.791 --> 28:14.459
Sorry about what I said earlier.

28:14.561 --> 28:16.794
That was the grief talking.

28:16.897 --> 28:19.431
- All right.
- Catherine, honey...?

28:19.533 --> 28:21.866
- I need a tissue.
- I don't have a tissue.

28:21.968 --> 28:23.335
Well, that's useless.

28:23.437 --> 28:24.736
- Ma'am.
- Yes.

28:24.838 --> 28:27.539
I hated my father.

28:28.403 --> 28:30.108
Thank you, Tom.

28:30.210 --> 28:31.876
To Congress we go.

28:31.978 --> 28:35.313
To Congress we go, yeah.

28:37.317 --> 28:39.074
Congratulations.
