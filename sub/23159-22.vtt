WEBVTT

00:01.107 --> 00:02.540
We're gonna die! I know it!

00:05.878 --> 00:07.402
<i>CQ. CQ.</i>

00:07.447 --> 00:09.745
My God, man, this is an emergency.

00:09.782 --> 00:12.342
She can't have a party during a hurricane.

00:14.921 --> 00:17.788
- You got to come. She's having the baby.
- What baby?

00:17.824 --> 00:19.451
I think I can explain.

00:19.492 --> 00:22.086
I was afraid she was gonna
give birth on this.

00:22.895 --> 00:24.453
Are you the prince?

00:24.497 --> 00:27.295
What did you have in mind?

01:39.289 --> 01:41.780
<i>Although the brunt of Hurricane Kukana</i>

01:41.824 --> 01:45.021
<i>is expected to be borne
by the islands of Kauai and Niihau,</i>

01:45.061 --> 01:48.622
<i>Oahu is also gearing up
to receive considerable damage.</i>

01:48.665 --> 01:53.796
<i>High winds have knocked out phone lines
in many areas, including the North Shore,</i>

01:53.836 --> 01:58.136
<i>and phone company officials inform us
that resumption of service is not possible</i>

01:58.174 --> 02:00.369
<i>until well after that storm's over.</i>

02:00.410 --> 02:05.871
<i>Meanwhile power is also out in many areas
and rolling blackouts are now the rule.</i>

02:05.915 --> 02:09.851
<i>Please be sure that you have
a plentiful supply of candles and matches</i>

02:09.886 --> 02:13.219
<i>as the darkness will continue on
throughout...</i>

02:13.256 --> 02:15.724
Higgins, I can't find the matches.

02:15.758 --> 02:18.056
Oh, my God.

02:18.094 --> 02:21.655
- Whoops.
- Whoops? All you can say is whoops?

02:21.698 --> 02:25.361
Come on, Higgins,
what's a little wine glass at a time like this?

02:25.401 --> 02:27.062
I was looking for the matches.

02:27.103 --> 02:31.096
Do you expect me to feel my way
over to the auxiliary generator panel?

02:31.140 --> 02:34.576
- That did not sound like a glass.
- Aha!

02:36.980 --> 02:43.044
Magnum, that was a Ming Dynasty vase given
to me by General Chiang Kai-shek.

02:43.653 --> 02:47.987
It was the spring of '48. I was attached
to his fifth division as a military adviser.

02:48.024 --> 02:51.824
The general in command of the unit
refused to follow my advice.

02:51.861 --> 02:56.525
He is now a dishwasher in a mediocre
Mandarin restaurant in Stockton, California.

02:56.566 --> 02:58.124
- Needless to say...
- <i>O</i> w!

03:00.136 --> 03:03.162
Give me the matches, Magnum.

03:03.206 --> 03:06.107
- Where are you?
- I'm over...

03:09.645 --> 03:10.634
<i>..</i> here.

03:11.481 --> 03:12.880
That wasn't me.

03:12.915 --> 03:16.783
Nevertheless, I'm holding you
personally responsible

03:16.819 --> 03:19.253
- for all damages accrued...
- Hold it!

03:19.288 --> 03:24.555
Just hold it, Higgins.
I did not start this hurri... hurricane.

03:24.594 --> 03:27.859
- You can't blame me for that.
- No, you didn't and I can't.

03:27.897 --> 03:30.229
But the damage from your spastic fumbling

03:30.266 --> 03:33.997
far overrides any fury
nature has wrought or will wrought.

03:34.037 --> 03:36.164
My spastic fumbling?

03:36.205 --> 03:40.642
Higgins, you knocked over
the Bridge on the River Kwai.

03:41.911 --> 03:43.776
<i>O</i> h, my God.

03:44.347 --> 03:45.837
Sorry.

03:45.882 --> 03:50.910
Now, I'm going back to the guesthouse
to close my shutters and open the refrigerator.

03:50.953 --> 03:53.285
- Good night, Higgins.
- <i>O</i> ne moment, Magnum.

03:53.322 --> 03:55.722
I'm going to need you for the party.

03:57.427 --> 03:59.418
You're not going through with this?

03:59.462 --> 04:02.124
Magnum, Mr. Masters'
Spring Equinox Weekend Party

04:02.165 --> 04:04.827
is one of the premier social events
of the season.

04:04.867 --> 04:06.858
To miss it would be unthinkable.

04:06.903 --> 04:11.203
This hurricane that's brewing is also
one of the premier events of the season.

04:11.240 --> 04:13.231
To miss it would be impossible.

04:13.276 --> 04:16.211
Don't you think it might be a good idea
to call this off?

04:16.245 --> 04:17.735
It's out of the question.

04:17.779 --> 04:20.647
The guests are already en route,
as is Mr. Masters.

04:20.683 --> 04:23.777
How do you propose cancellation,
by carrier pigeon?

04:23.820 --> 04:26.186
The phones, in case you forgot, are down.

04:26.222 --> 04:30.852
- Call them on your shortwave radio.
- The guests don't have shortwave.

04:31.928 --> 04:33.088
<i>O</i> h.

04:33.129 --> 04:37.361
Higgins, it doesn't make any sense.
You can't have a party during a hurricane.

04:37.400 --> 04:42.667
Magnum, your propensity for overstatement
and panic never ceases to amaze me.

04:42.705 --> 04:47.142
I checked with the National Weather Service
45 minutes ago via my shortwave

04:47.176 --> 04:49.167
and we have nothing to worry about.

04:49.212 --> 04:51.874
The estate will be
on the far periphery of the storm.

04:51.914 --> 04:54.974
A few gusts of wind,
a spot or two of rain, nothing more.

05:05.361 --> 05:09.559
I believe the party is about to begin.
Try not to be too destructive.

05:14.537 --> 05:16.664
- Yes?
- <i>Archie MacPherson.</i>

05:16.706 --> 05:19.174
<i>O</i> ne moment, Mr. MacPherson.
I'll open the gate.

05:19.208 --> 05:20.698
<i>I'd be grateful, laddie.</i>

05:22.245 --> 05:24.236
Mr. Masters' accountant.

05:24.280 --> 05:28.683
He's also using the trip to undertake
a complete audit of the estate's expenses

05:28.718 --> 05:31.551
including automobiles,
wines, electronic equipment

05:31.587 --> 05:35.717
and the feasibility of keeping
a full-time security expert.

05:38.794 --> 05:41.695
Jonathan Higgins. Archie MacPherson.

05:41.731 --> 05:44.165
- Good meeting you, finally.
- How do you do?

05:44.200 --> 05:47.431
I still haven't received
the statements from last month.

05:47.470 --> 05:49.301
Well, they're in the mail.

05:49.338 --> 05:52.432
Allow me to take your things
while Magnum gets you a drink.

05:52.475 --> 05:54.943
- Excellent.
- Scotch. Neat.

05:54.977 --> 05:58.504
Now, Mr. Magnum,
that's very good detective work.

05:58.548 --> 06:01.813
- Thank you.
- Mr. Masters speaks very highly of you.

06:02.652 --> 06:04.051
- He does?
- Aye.

06:04.987 --> 06:09.151
Mr. MacPherson, I thought
Mr. Masters would be arriving with you.

06:09.959 --> 06:12.359
Sorry, Higgins, he's delayed in Paris.

06:12.395 --> 06:15.455
A dalliance with one of the dancers
in the Folies BergÃ¨re.

06:15.498 --> 06:18.194
He will not arrive till tomorrow morning.

06:18.234 --> 06:19.701
<i>O</i> h.

06:19.735 --> 06:23.637
- Then he'll miss dinner.
- Aye, but not dessert.

06:24.473 --> 06:27.806
He said to start without him.
Where are the others?

06:29.145 --> 06:32.012
- Yes?
- <i>Roland and Wanda Martine.</i>

06:32.048 --> 06:34.710
Right away, Your Majesties.
I'll release the gate.

06:34.750 --> 06:36.308
<i>Thank you, Higgins.</i>

06:36.352 --> 06:40.015
The prince and princess of Tervia.
Fixtures at Mr. Masters' parties.

06:40.056 --> 06:42.581
He is one of the most cultured men
on the continent.

06:42.625 --> 06:44.616
Really? What do they do?

06:44.660 --> 06:47.754
Do? They're royalty.
They go to and give parties.

06:47.797 --> 06:49.628
That's what they do.

06:53.336 --> 06:55.327
- Have you ever been to Tervia?
- No.

06:55.371 --> 06:57.566
A delightful principality, actually.

06:57.607 --> 07:00.201
Nestled high in the Pyrenees.
Very picturesque.

07:00.243 --> 07:04.441
I was there for six months in '42,
recuperating from a severe leg wound.

07:04.480 --> 07:09.474
I was hidden in a monastery where
all the monks had taken vows of silence.

07:09.518 --> 07:13.545
As you can well imagine,
communication was somewhat difficult.

07:13.589 --> 07:16.786
- In fact, all they could do was listen to me.
- Thank you.

07:16.826 --> 07:20.284
<i>O</i> ne day this particular chap
could no longer control himself.

07:20.329 --> 07:23.662
Needless to say, I was shocked
at the words emanating from...

07:25.268 --> 07:27.964
I hope Magnum displays
proper respect for royalty.

07:28.638 --> 07:29.798
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

07:29.839 --> 07:31.500
Good evening. Higgins?

07:31.540 --> 07:34.805
No, I'm Magnum
but people get us mixed up all the time.

07:35.745 --> 07:38.043
May I get you... Your Highness...

07:38.080 --> 07:40.344
- Highnesses.
- Highnesses... a drink?

07:40.383 --> 07:43.181
- Wonderful. Courvoisier.
- Yes, Your Highnesses.

07:43.219 --> 07:46.882
And a Mai Tai
with a pineapple in the top <i>. O</i> K?

07:46.922 --> 07:48.913
<i>O</i> f course, Your Highnesses.

07:48.958 --> 07:52.018
Why don't you go in the dining room?
I will bring them in.

07:52.061 --> 07:56.020
- Splendid. You'll see to our bag?
- <i>O</i> f course, Your Highnesses.

08:02.571 --> 08:06.166
Yes, right. Straight up the gravel drive.
Thank you.

08:08.411 --> 08:10.072
Good evening, Your Majesties.

08:10.112 --> 08:12.512
- Higgins?
- Yes. So good of you to come.

08:12.548 --> 08:14.812
Lovely to be here.

08:14.850 --> 08:18.217
This is Archibald MacPherson.
If you'll excuse me for a moment.

08:18.254 --> 08:20.279
- Good evening.
- Your Highness.

08:20.323 --> 08:23.349
- Mr. MacPherson.
- <i>O</i> h, Your Highness.

08:24.193 --> 08:29.096
- Who's this one, the Duke of Earl?
- Duke Davis. Would you let him in?

08:29.131 --> 08:31.531
Duke Davis?

08:31.567 --> 08:33.797
I believe I just said that.

08:34.904 --> 08:36.303
My God, Magnum.

08:37.006 --> 08:40.066
The expression on your face
is reminiscent of an adolescent

08:40.109 --> 08:42.441
who's just received his first kiss.

08:43.746 --> 08:46.544
The Duke Davis? From Detroit?

08:46.582 --> 08:48.243
Yes, the Panthers.

08:48.284 --> 08:51.481
Tigers. Detroit Tigers.

08:52.388 --> 08:55.414
Don't you know that last season he hit 326?

08:55.458 --> 08:57.892
He slugged 34 home runs.

08:57.927 --> 09:01.124
Drove in 116, scored 105.

09:01.163 --> 09:05.224
Hit 39 doubles, nine triples, stole 47 bases,

09:05.267 --> 09:07.258
committed only six errors,

09:07.303 --> 09:11.103
won the Golden Glove,
the team MVP and in the all-star game...

09:24.653 --> 09:27.918
- Woo! Boy, the hawk is out tonight, son.
- Yeah.

09:27.957 --> 09:31.188
- Tossing coconuts around like fast balls.
- Yeah.

09:34.230 --> 09:36.698
- You Higgins?
- Yeah.

09:41.737 --> 09:44.570
- Where's Robbie?
- Huh?

09:44.607 --> 09:46.939
Robin Masters?

09:46.976 --> 09:51.310
I promised I'd work with him on his stroke.
He tends to inside-out on his swing.

09:54.250 --> 09:58.118
I guess you don't know
what I'm talking about.

09:58.154 --> 10:01.453
Where is everybody?

10:16.305 --> 10:17.294
Yeah?

10:17.339 --> 10:20.274
<i>You gotta help me, man. Let us in.</i>

10:20.309 --> 10:21.469
Who are you?

10:21.510 --> 10:24.775
<i>It's nobody you know.
Our van just broke down on the highway.</i>

10:24.814 --> 10:27.783
<i>I'm with my brother and his wife.
She's about to have a kid.</i>

10:27.817 --> 10:30.377
<i>You gotta let us in, man. Please.</i>

10:31.520 --> 10:34.683
Hold on a minute. I'll come out and let you in.

10:34.723 --> 10:36.623
<i>Thanks, but hurry.</i>

10:36.659 --> 10:40.220
The Florida Keys, '53 or '54, it was.

10:40.262 --> 10:42.730
I was deep-sea fishing with Papa in his ketch

10:42.765 --> 10:45.529
when we got word of the hurricane
over the shortwave.

10:45.568 --> 10:49.334
In that part of the world
hurricanes are really hurricanes,

10:49.371 --> 10:52.704
not this overblown squall
that the media's so excited about.

10:52.741 --> 10:54.800
- Papa decided...
- Excuse me, Higgins.

10:54.844 --> 10:57.404
Was he working
on The <i>O</i> Id Man And The Sea then?

10:57.446 --> 11:00.711
The manuscript
was only in the outline stage at that point

11:00.749 --> 11:05.516
and it had a quite different title,
something like Grandfather's Fish.

11:05.554 --> 11:09.854
But after many hours of discussion
and careful perusing of the character and plot,

11:09.892 --> 11:12.554
we were able to effect some changes
that no doubt...

11:12.595 --> 11:14.756
Higgins, a lot of people look at that book

11:14.797 --> 11:18.733
as a metaphor for the indomitability
of the human spirit,

11:18.767 --> 11:21.668
but I prefer to take it on its own terms.

11:21.704 --> 11:23.899
A story of stirring high adventure.

11:23.939 --> 11:26.066
Quite. Actually...

11:26.108 --> 11:29.509
A tribute to man's persistence and heroism.

11:29.545 --> 11:32.605
Really, Rollie, you do know
how boring you get sometimes.

11:32.648 --> 11:35.674
- Can't we talk about something else?
- Wanda, please.

11:37.286 --> 11:40.221
Higgins, more Mai Tais, please.

11:40.256 --> 11:43.783
- And don't forget the pineapple.
- <i>O</i> f course, Your Majesty.

11:43.826 --> 11:45.851
Call me Wanda.

11:48.097 --> 11:49.086
Yes.

11:50.199 --> 11:55.603
So, Mr. MacPherson, what's Robbie think
about deferred payment contracts?

11:56.372 --> 12:02.800
Tax-wise, of course, they're great, but
they inhibit your present investment power.

12:03.946 --> 12:09.907
Tell me, what's it like to be playing
in the same infield with Lou Whittaker?

12:11.420 --> 12:15.754
- Higgins, these people are...
- Most assuredly not on the guest list.

12:15.791 --> 12:17.452
Explain yourself.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.089
That's what I was trying to do.

12:20.129 --> 12:24.589
- Look, we don't mean to cause any trouble.
- I am sure not. However...

12:24.633 --> 12:27.500
Their van broke down
and it's pouring rain outside.

12:27.536 --> 12:30.972
Fine. Call a tow truck
and have them wait in the guesthouse.

12:31.006 --> 12:33.566
Call a tow truck? Higgins, the phones are out.

12:33.609 --> 12:37.101
- I'm aware of that. You can use...
- We're taking one of your cars.

12:37.146 --> 12:39.273
I beg your pardon?

12:39.315 --> 12:44.150
And while you're at it, why don't you fill it up
with all your money and stuff?

12:45.354 --> 12:48.653
We'll take the purple Rolls.

12:59.231 --> 13:02.223
<i>Bad news
from the National Weather Service.</i>

13:02.268 --> 13:05.169
<i>Hurricane Kukana
has abruptly changed direction</i>

13:05.204 --> 13:08.401
<i>and is headed on a collision course
with Oahu's North Shore.</i>

13:08.440 --> 13:12.968
<i>You have three hours to batten down
everything you don't want sent to Australia.</i>

13:13.012 --> 13:15.480
<i>Following is a list of evacuation centers...</i>

13:16.882 --> 13:21.683
I must warn you, this criminal endeavor
will ultimately put you behind bars.

13:21.720 --> 13:27.022
- Your only rational alternative...
- This is our only rational alternative, mister.

13:27.059 --> 13:30.756
We just came from behind bars.
Move it before this storm gets any worse.

13:30.796 --> 13:32.787
Miss...

13:33.599 --> 13:34.896
Miss.

13:36.869 --> 13:38.598
Just a second, you creep.

13:41.006 --> 13:42.268
I'm very sorry.

13:42.308 --> 13:44.868
- How many more guests?
- <i>O</i> ne, plus Mr. Masters.

13:44.910 --> 13:47.674
- What do you plan to do?
- Nothing.

13:47.713 --> 13:49.374
Come on, get his stuff.

13:49.415 --> 13:54.011
You sure about this, Randy? Why don't we
get the car and get outta here? That way...

13:54.053 --> 13:57.511
It's still armed robbery.
We might as well take everything.

13:57.556 --> 14:02.391
- Your brother is making very good sense.
- Does he look like my brother?

14:02.428 --> 14:07.058
If you don't get back to where you were I will
blow your brains out the back of your head.

14:07.099 --> 14:09.397
I see.

14:13.472 --> 14:15.372
I need your wallet.

14:15.407 --> 14:19.036
- How about that ring there too?
- That's my World Series ring.

14:19.078 --> 14:21.638
Hey. Win another one, Duke.

14:25.451 --> 14:28.045
That's a sport <i>. O</i> K, let's hit it. Come on.

14:30.456 --> 14:33.721
- Come on. Let's go to the car.
- I wish you hadn't...

14:33.759 --> 14:36.057
- Gail?
- I'm <i>O</i> K.

14:36.095 --> 14:38.086
- It's not time yet.
- Sure?

14:38.130 --> 14:40.530
Yeah, she's sure. Come on, let's just go.

14:46.472 --> 14:48.167
Go ahead.

14:51.677 --> 14:52.837
Hello, lady.

14:57.016 --> 14:58.176
Answer it.

15:04.990 --> 15:06.981
- Yes?
- <i>Candace Wingate.</i>

15:09.728 --> 15:13.129
Candace Wingate.
Explosions In Poetry magazine.

15:17.569 --> 15:19.560
Right away, Miss Wingate.

15:19.605 --> 15:21.903
<i>Thank you, darling. You're so kind.</i>

15:21.941 --> 15:27.106
<i>Inasmuch as I'm out here standing in the
rain. That's standing, darling, not singing.</i>

15:27.146 --> 15:29.273
Sorry. Just drive right through.

15:32.084 --> 15:35.679
- I'll open the door.
- Wait a minute. I gotta think.

15:35.721 --> 15:38.815
- Don't unduly strain yourself.
- Shut up.

15:42.061 --> 15:46.293
- All right. Go ahead. No...
- Funny business.

15:50.002 --> 15:53.802
It's all right. We let the broad in,
we take her stuff, we split.

15:53.839 --> 15:56.865
- I gotta lay back down first.
- <i>O</i> h, I knew it.

15:57.509 --> 16:00.945
Dammit, Randy. If it wasn't for Gail
we'd still be in the work camp.

16:00.980 --> 16:03.471
If my sister had a moustache
she'd be my brother.

16:03.515 --> 16:06.382
Now, you can take a nap in the car.

16:09.388 --> 16:12.050
The butler guy, he didn't get the door.

16:13.258 --> 16:15.249
All right, you cover them.

16:20.466 --> 16:24.129
Easy. Real easy now.

16:24.169 --> 16:29.163
Don't worry, guy. This gonna be your first kid?

16:32.177 --> 16:34.839
CQ. CQ. WP6 RNA.

16:36.815 --> 16:39.306
CQ. CQ. WP6 RNA.

16:41.053 --> 16:43.248
My God, isn't anyone there?

16:43.288 --> 16:46.382
<i>Yeah, bro. Howzit?
This is Dr. Pipeline. Over.</i>

16:46.425 --> 16:47.585
I beg your pardon?

16:47.626 --> 16:52.563
<i>You still on C.B. band, bro. Dr. Pipeline,
that's my handle. What you like? Over.</i>

16:52.598 --> 16:56.625
Yes, this is Jonathan Quayle Higgins
out at Robin's Nest. Do you copy?

16:56.668 --> 17:00.035
<i>Birds? What you bother me
with birds for, bro?</i>

17:00.072 --> 17:02.666
<i>There's a big wind brewing, yeah? Over.</i>

17:02.708 --> 17:05.108
I know that, my good man.
This is an emergency.

17:05.144 --> 17:08.238
- <i>Your car?</i>
- No, the autos are quite secure.

17:08.280 --> 17:10.271
We're being held by armed robbers.

17:10.315 --> 17:14.843
<i>Then why you hassle me? I got a tow truck
out on the Kalanianaole Highway.</i>

17:14.887 --> 17:17.252
<i>It's a big mess out here, bro. Over.</i>

17:17.289 --> 17:20.122
Don't you understand?
We're being held prisoners.

17:20.159 --> 17:22.388
<i>I know, brother. By this storm.</i>

17:22.428 --> 17:25.556
<i>Look, you stay inside
and keep this channel clear.</i>

17:25.597 --> 17:28.862
<i>It's only for emergencies. Understand?
Over and out.</i>

17:28.901 --> 17:30.892
<i>My God, man, this is an emergency.</i>

17:30.936 --> 17:34.963
- <i>Crazy haole.</i>
- CQ. CQ.

17:40.045 --> 17:42.445
Don't do it.

17:43.549 --> 17:45.073
Please.

17:51.857 --> 17:56.817
Get up there, mister,
or the second barrel is for your doggies.

17:58.263 --> 17:59.753
Stay, lads.

18:03.635 --> 18:07.298
I appreciate it, mister.
I got a golden retriever myself.

18:08.340 --> 18:10.672
I see you've found the gun collection.

18:10.709 --> 18:13.269
Yeah, and some
that was out of the collection.

18:13.312 --> 18:17.248
You are one paranoid dude, man,
aren't you?

18:23.088 --> 18:25.386
Lads!

18:31.597 --> 18:34.327
See? You are paranoid.

18:36.368 --> 18:38.359
I don't blame him.

18:38.403 --> 18:42.533
Don't you realize that it's dangerous
to shoot off guns inside a house

18:42.574 --> 18:46.032
and criminal to destroy such fine wine?

18:48.013 --> 18:49.674
Hello, Jonathan.

18:53.585 --> 18:57.612
I swear Robin throws a party
just like he writes.

18:57.656 --> 19:00.386
- Tacky, tacky, tacky.
- Thank you, darling.

19:01.527 --> 19:06.658
This is the only party I've been to
where the guests are the door prizes.

19:06.698 --> 19:08.689
I hope you're comfortable, dear.

19:12.871 --> 19:15.431
Higgins, you've been shot!

19:16.742 --> 19:21.509
Hardly, Magnum. This is
a quite immature Chateau Marcel '77.

19:21.547 --> 19:25.779
Your concern is touching but I at least
made an effort to get rid of these hooligans.

19:25.817 --> 19:29.548
- And you almost got killed.
- It would have been with honor and dignity.

19:29.588 --> 19:31.715
Fine. Long live the empire.

19:31.757 --> 19:34.351
Go on, I'll cover.

19:40.699 --> 19:42.394
Bye-bye, folks.

19:45.504 --> 19:48.337
- Come on!
- Randy, you didn't, did you?

19:48.373 --> 19:51.638
A lamp, you jelly wink.
I shot out the damn lamp.

19:56.048 --> 20:00.610
That should do it. A wee bit of excitement
but it appears no one's the worse for wear.

20:00.652 --> 20:03.621
Speak for yourself, darling.

20:03.655 --> 20:05.953
I was afraid
she was gonna give birth on this.

20:05.991 --> 20:09.085
Darling, please don't cry.

20:09.127 --> 20:12.119
Why not? They took everything.

20:12.965 --> 20:15.195
We still have each other.

20:18.003 --> 20:21.803
- We gotta go after 'em.
- Chase them into a hurricane?

20:21.840 --> 20:24.468
You can't just let 'em get away.
They got my ring.

20:24.509 --> 20:29.003
Even if we're stupid enough to go out there,
they got more than your ring, they got guns.

20:29.047 --> 20:31.038
There's absolutely nothing we can do.

20:31.083 --> 20:33.074
Let me tell you something, pal.

20:33.118 --> 20:37.020
If we're down 11 to 1 in the eighth inning,
we still run out the grounders.

20:37.789 --> 20:39.848
We still play aggressive ball.

20:41.393 --> 20:43.384
You were dogging it.

20:48.300 --> 20:51.167
- He's right. And put it in your own parlance.
- Come on.

20:51.203 --> 20:54.468
- I'm going to have to tell Mr. Masters.
- Higgins.

21:01.813 --> 21:05.146
There goes the auxiliary generator.
We need the kerosene lamps.

21:05.183 --> 21:07.845
- You know where they are.
- Come with me.

21:14.526 --> 21:18.223
How droll. Just like Key Largo.

21:18.263 --> 21:23.394
Yeah, except that was in black and white.

21:26.538 --> 21:27.869
Higgins?

21:27.906 --> 21:31.933
You know those spooky movies
where the mansion's all dark

21:31.977 --> 21:36.073
and the people run around
and they're scared stiff and like that

21:36.114 --> 21:38.105
and they carry a candelabra?

21:38.150 --> 21:40.141
Well, these things are heavy.

21:40.185 --> 21:42.813
Magnum, your behavior has been inexplicable.

21:42.854 --> 21:45.982
Inexplicable?
Well, then, perhaps I'd better explain.

21:46.024 --> 21:48.219
- Please.
- Hold this on the bottom.

21:48.260 --> 21:52.196
- Your acquiescence to those hooligans...
- Was for a damn good reason.

21:52.230 --> 21:55.597
- Why? Where did you leave the matches?
- <i>O</i> n the bar.

21:55.634 --> 21:57.625
- We haven't got any.
- Here are some.

21:57.669 --> 21:59.227
Then give them to me.

21:59.271 --> 22:02.832
- Look, I just wanted 'em out of the house.
- As did we all, but...

22:02.874 --> 22:05.775
But nothing!
Robbery is one thing, murder's another.

22:05.811 --> 22:09.042
Murder? He didn't shoot me,
he shot the radio and an...

22:09.081 --> 22:11.948
Immature Chateau Marcel 1977.

22:11.983 --> 22:16.511
I know that. I'm not talking about that,
I'm talking about Robin Masters.

22:16.555 --> 22:18.580
<i>O</i> ne of the guests is trying to kill him.

22:18.623 --> 22:20.284
How do you know that?

22:20.325 --> 22:22.122
Because he told me, that's why.

22:23.095 --> 22:24.756
My job is to catch the killer.

22:24.796 --> 22:30.530
Kids stealing wallets and jewelry
is a complication we could do without.

22:31.436 --> 22:33.631
Now at least we've got a chance.

22:35.474 --> 22:37.305
- Get in here.
- You're...

22:37.342 --> 22:38.673
Yeah, we're back.

22:38.710 --> 22:41.042
- Why? I thought...
- Yeah, so did we.

22:41.079 --> 22:44.742
But there ain't any more purple Rolls
or any cars.

22:44.783 --> 22:47.149
They're waist deep in mud.

22:47.185 --> 22:50.552
We're booked... for the duration.

22:58.478 --> 23:01.641
<i>High winds and rough surf
continue to pound the North Shore</i>

23:01.681 --> 23:03.740
<i>in anticipation of the Big Blow,</i>

23:03.783 --> 23:06.183
<i>as the locals are beginning to nickname it.</i>

23:06.219 --> 23:09.154
<i>The National Weather Service,
however, calls it Kukana</i>

23:09.189 --> 23:13.717
<i>and predicts the full force of the hurricane
will hit Oahu at about 1:30 this morning,</i>

23:13.760 --> 23:17.753
<i>so wherever you are, do you and</i>
<i>your loved ones a big favor</i> - <i>stay put.</i>

23:17.797 --> 23:19.788
And I mean put.

23:19.833 --> 23:22.461
Got me? Mmm?

23:23.636 --> 23:26.161
Impressive but foolish.

23:26.206 --> 23:28.197
After all, if you think...

23:28.241 --> 23:31.802
Not only do I think
I can keep you jerks here, I know it.

23:31.845 --> 23:35.838
You got no place to go, no means to get there

23:35.882 --> 23:39.113
and a real mean headwind.

23:39.152 --> 23:42.986
Look at you. I know what you're thinking.
Big plots, huh?

23:43.022 --> 23:46.355
Before you get two feet
out of that door or any door,

23:46.393 --> 23:49.988
this pretty young lady
is gonna get her head blown right off.

23:50.029 --> 23:52.520
Stay put.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.694
That goes for everybody.

23:55.735 --> 24:00.502
Nobody leaves this house...
except me and Candy here.

24:00.540 --> 24:03.304
Look, don't make matters worse
by taking hostages.

24:03.343 --> 24:07.006
All I want is six hours. Just me and Candy.

24:12.952 --> 24:16.945
She's in a good deal of pain.
With your permission I'll move her to the den.

24:18.224 --> 24:20.419
Go ahead. Move her.

24:25.698 --> 24:28.360
Just you and me. How delightful.

24:29.335 --> 24:34.830
You remind me of my third husband.
He was the strong and stupid type too.

24:34.874 --> 24:39.140
- I can see why he divorced you.
- He's dead.

24:52.025 --> 24:54.721
Now, now. Everything's all right, dear.

24:54.761 --> 24:57.161
Nothing to be alarmed about.

24:57.197 --> 24:59.461
Actually this reminds me of a time in Persia

24:59.499 --> 25:03.026
when I found myself acting as midwife
to a Kurdistani peasant girl.

25:03.069 --> 25:06.937
There were no modern facilities
or even rudimentary medical implements.

25:06.973 --> 25:08.304
What's that got to do...

25:08.341 --> 25:12.243
The girl couldn't speak English.
All she could do was gibber in Kurdish.

25:13.046 --> 25:18.040
My instructions went totally unheeded and
it necessitated rendering her unconscious...

25:18.084 --> 25:20.609
Higgins!

25:20.653 --> 25:22.314
- How are you doing?
- All right.

25:22.355 --> 25:25.483
For a woman about to give birth,
she's doing remarkably well.

25:26.826 --> 25:30.489
- It sounds like...
- She's fine. Beginning to dilate, actually.

25:30.530 --> 25:32.521
The other guests, how are they doing?

25:32.565 --> 25:37.298
Fine, considering your buddy
has a 12-gauge pointed at a woman's head.

25:37.337 --> 25:40.204
- He's not my buddy.
- He was Lou's cellmate.

25:41.574 --> 25:43.667
I couldn't take one without the other.

25:43.710 --> 25:46.770
Look, mister. Both of you.

25:46.813 --> 25:49.304
I'm real sorry about this.

25:50.316 --> 25:54.446
All me and Lou ever wanted was a chance
to be together when the kid was born.

25:54.487 --> 25:58.389
- What's that got to do with robbing people?
- Listen, it was Randy's idea.

25:58.424 --> 26:01.552
Maybe so,
but you were holding a gun on us too.

26:03.596 --> 26:06.429
- I think it's time to boil some water up.
- Higgins...

26:06.466 --> 26:10.334
For tea, Magnum. I think a spot of tea
would go down nicely now.

26:14.007 --> 26:16.532
If her breathing changes
we'll be in the kitchen.

26:16.576 --> 26:18.407
Sure. Sure.

26:18.444 --> 26:20.537
Her breathing. I got you.

26:28.288 --> 26:31.883
- Will you stop that?
- What? I thought you wanted some tea.

26:31.925 --> 26:35.520
What I want is to know why
Mr. Masters didn't inform me of this plot.

26:35.562 --> 26:39.498
These guests are his closest friends.
I know them as well as he does.

26:39.532 --> 26:41.966
That is precisely why he didn't tell you.

26:42.001 --> 26:44.595
You wouldn't have my objectivity about them.

26:45.572 --> 26:46.664
I see.

26:47.807 --> 26:50.674
Come on, Higgins.
I'm sure it was nothing personal.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.837
Robin called me a couple of days ago.

26:52.879 --> 26:55.905
For the last six months
he's been receiving death threats.

26:55.949 --> 26:57.439
Possibly a prankster.

26:57.483 --> 27:01.510
That's what he thought until
his secretary got one that was real specific.

27:02.589 --> 27:05.524
- What do you mean? This party?
- Exactly.

27:05.558 --> 27:09.585
I want you to know, Higgins,
I have got everything under control.

27:09.629 --> 27:11.859
No one has been in any danger...

27:11.898 --> 27:14.196
- Her breathing's changed.
- Changed? How?

27:14.233 --> 27:18.101
Well, you know,
first it's real fast, like she's panting,

27:18.137 --> 27:20.162
and then it stops and starts again.

27:20.206 --> 27:21.867
- That's labor.
- Labor.

27:21.908 --> 27:25.810
It's perfectly normal. Go back to her.
This could take hours.

27:25.845 --> 27:27.870
<i>O</i> K. Thanks, Doc.

27:30.283 --> 27:33.446
- Doc?
- Cambridge, '47. Doctor of mathematics.

27:33.486 --> 27:37.923
Higgins, is there anything you haven't done,
anywhere you haven't been...?

27:37.957 --> 27:41.620
We don't have time now
for your rhetorical irrelevancies.

27:41.661 --> 27:44.824
- Who is your prime suspect?
- I don't have one.

27:44.864 --> 27:49.324
Brilliant. You've failed to do your homework.
How Robin could entrust you with this...

27:49.369 --> 27:54.136
Higgins, I have done my homework
and that's just the problem.

27:54.173 --> 27:57.768
None of the guests has a motive.
In fact they all owe Robin in a big way.

27:57.810 --> 28:01.041
- I know that.
- For instance, Duke Davis.

28:01.080 --> 28:04.641
He was supported by Robin
when he kicked around the minor leagues.

28:04.684 --> 28:08.245
Without his help he would have gone back
to Donora years ago.

28:08.287 --> 28:11.051
- Donora?
- Pennsylvania. Stan Musial's home town.

28:11.090 --> 28:14.253
Roland was bankrolled by Robin
during his stint at Columbia

28:14.293 --> 28:17.126
after his parents cut him off
and tried to drag him home.

28:17.163 --> 28:18.221
I know that.

28:18.264 --> 28:23.793
Robin anonymously supported Candace's
magazine for 25 years. God knows why.

28:23.836 --> 28:27.203
Explosions In Poetry
happens to be a very erudite publication.

28:27.240 --> 28:29.140
Be that as it may.

28:29.175 --> 28:32.372
Archie MacPherson's grandson
would not be running around

28:32.412 --> 28:34.846
except for a dialysis machine Robin bought.

28:34.881 --> 28:39.443
- Do you know what those things cost?
- Magnum, I know all that.

28:41.187 --> 28:44.588
So everything you've done
has been part of your charade?

28:44.624 --> 28:47.889
Your protestations about the party,
ignorance of our guests,

28:47.927 --> 28:52.125
your childish infatuation
with Duke Davis and the Detroit Panthers.

28:52.165 --> 28:53.962
- Tigers.
- Whatever.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.231
The one thing that seems
to have eluded you is a suspect.

28:57.270 --> 29:02.071
You're right. But I do have a plan, Higgins.
First, though, we gotta get rid of Randy.

29:02.108 --> 29:05.271
- Doc, the baby moved.
- What?

29:05.311 --> 29:08.803
Yeah. First it was on one side
and now it's on the other.

29:08.848 --> 29:11.510
- You gotta come quick.
- That's also normal.

29:11.551 --> 29:14.520
The baby's moving closer to the birth canal.

29:16.355 --> 29:20.689
Well, perhaps we'd better have a look.
Come along, Magnum.

29:24.864 --> 29:27.697
<i>O</i> h, God! It hurts!

29:29.035 --> 29:32.698
Quite. Bringing a new life into this world
is never easy,

29:32.739 --> 29:34.900
otherwise they wouldn't call it labor.

29:34.941 --> 29:37.136
Under these conditions, the dangers...

29:37.176 --> 29:39.770
- Dangers? What dangers?
- What dangers?

29:39.812 --> 29:41.803
Magnum, take over here.

29:45.318 --> 29:47.377
All right...

29:50.423 --> 29:51.481
<i>O</i> K?

29:51.524 --> 29:56.655
I don't mean to alarm you but perhaps
you've noticed this is not Honolulu General.

29:56.696 --> 29:59.358
Robin's Nest was not designed
as a maternity ward.

29:59.398 --> 30:00.888
What are you saying?

30:00.933 --> 30:05.393
Merely that if something should go wrong
or any complications should develop...

30:05.438 --> 30:09.101
- Yeah, but you're a doctor.
- <i>O</i> f mathematics.

30:09.142 --> 30:12.600
- What?
- Mathematics <i>. O</i> ne and one equal two.

30:12.645 --> 30:15.239
And armed robbery
equals five to 15 in <i>O</i> ahu prison,

30:15.281 --> 30:16.942
not some country club work camp.

30:16.983 --> 30:20.282
Yeah, but what about that Kurdistani woman?

30:20.319 --> 30:22.310
Sheer luck.

30:22.355 --> 30:27.292
- No, you said you were a doctor.
- And you said you had a flat tire.

30:27.326 --> 30:30.124
<i>O</i> h, God. What am I gonna do?

30:33.266 --> 30:38.135
Well, young man, I have had some medical
training and maybe I can be of help.

30:38.171 --> 30:40.366
And maybe you can be of help too.

30:43.576 --> 30:46.875
Yeah, we were gonna have it all.

30:48.147 --> 30:51.810
Roland was going to write big, beautiful novels

30:51.851 --> 30:54.149
and I was gonna do the pictures.

30:55.087 --> 30:59.080
Everything was going to be just peachy.

30:59.125 --> 31:01.355
Until he couldn't get published.

31:01.394 --> 31:03.385
Wanda, please. Let's not...

31:03.429 --> 31:05.454
Don't Wanda me.

31:05.498 --> 31:09.901
- It's Your Highness.
- It was Wanda when I met you.

31:10.369 --> 31:14.169
Yeah, when I was waiting on tables
at the student union

31:14.207 --> 31:15.902
and you were the B. M <i>.O.</i> C.

31:15.942 --> 31:19.605
The prince from the country
nobody ever heard of.

31:19.645 --> 31:23.741
You were gonna sweep me off my feet
and take me away from it all.

31:23.783 --> 31:27.719
Yeah? Great. Where do I end up?

31:27.753 --> 31:32.850
In the middle of a freaking hurricane with
a bunch of mass murderers and lunatics.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.594
I thought being a princess was gonna be fun.

31:36.629 --> 31:40.121
Not too many girls from the Bronx
get to live in a castle.

31:41.734 --> 31:43.395
That's for sure.

31:43.436 --> 31:47.964
No heat, no air, no pool... except for the moat.

31:48.674 --> 31:52.007
- I mean, who needs it?
- You tell 'em, toots.

31:53.713 --> 31:56.511
What the hell kind of life is this anyway?

31:56.549 --> 31:59.245
Nothing but parties on top of parties

31:59.285 --> 32:04.552
and small talk about books and movies
and plays nobody ever heard of.

32:06.025 --> 32:10.689
I mean, you can take this high society stuff,
Your Majesty.

32:11.397 --> 32:16.494
Cos if we ever get out of this,
I'm going back to the Bronx.

32:16.535 --> 32:18.196
- So there.
- Randy!

32:18.905 --> 32:21.840
Randy! Come here! Come here quick!

32:22.575 --> 32:25.976
- Yo.
- I caught the limey trying to escape.

32:26.012 --> 32:29.038
That was a bad mistake, man.

32:30.082 --> 32:32.073
A real bad mistake.

32:34.420 --> 32:36.615
I say. Good show, chaps.

32:36.656 --> 32:39.523
Yeah, thanks, Lou.
Grab me that lamp cord, will you?

32:42.929 --> 32:47.025
I guess being a parent kind of changes
your perspective on things.

32:53.105 --> 32:57.542
- Why don't you try a clove hitch?
- I am using a clove hitch.

32:57.576 --> 33:00.511
Magnum, what precisely is your plan,
if you have one?

33:00.546 --> 33:03.982
- I've been trying to tell you ever since...
- You don't have one.

33:04.016 --> 33:06.211
I do <i>. O</i> r at least I did.

33:06.252 --> 33:09.346
I called Rick and T.C.
to tell them what was happening.

33:09.388 --> 33:11.515
Tell Rick and T.C. and not me?

33:11.557 --> 33:15.550
I have explained all that.
Give me a hand with him, will you?

33:18.864 --> 33:24.234
Anyway, they are flying to the estate
just as soon as the storm is over.

33:24.270 --> 33:26.465
Rick will be disguised to look like Robin.

33:26.505 --> 33:30.339
Rick trying to impersonate Mr. Masters?
Have you lost your senses?

33:30.376 --> 33:33.868
From a distance no one will know
the difference. They're both short.

33:34.914 --> 33:38.611
That'll put us in a position to nail the killer
when he or she makes a move.

33:38.651 --> 33:43.953
Do you think anyone would try to assassinate
Mr. Masters on his front lawn?

33:43.990 --> 33:45.651
No, Higgins, I don't.

33:45.691 --> 33:49.923
But Robin will want to take a shower and a nap
before greeting his guests. Am I right?

33:49.962 --> 33:53.523
That means he's going to be alone
in the privacy of his bedroom.

33:53.566 --> 33:57.263
So when the killer tippy-toes
up the stairs into the darkened room,

33:57.303 --> 33:59.294
I'll be waiting. It's foolproof.

33:59.338 --> 34:02.136
With Rick and T.C. involved,
nothing is foolproof.

34:03.009 --> 34:05.978
Higgins? I really resent that.

34:06.012 --> 34:08.572
A joke is a joke but I take my job seriously

34:08.614 --> 34:11.139
and I take my responsibility to Robin seriously.

34:11.183 --> 34:13.811
I've given this long and complete consideration

34:13.853 --> 34:16.378
and I am willing to tell you unequivocally

34:16.422 --> 34:20.380
there is nothing, I repeat, nothing,
that could possibly go wrong.

34:39.712 --> 34:41.703
We can explain, Thomas.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.552
You got to come.
She's starting to have the baby.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.451
- What baby?
- My baby.

34:49.487 --> 34:51.456
- Who are you?
- Who are you guys?

34:51.489 --> 34:53.788
- Friends.
- <i>O</i> f the family.

34:57.363 --> 35:00.161
Speaking of which,
another member is about to arrive.

35:02.201 --> 35:04.169
What is going on around here?

35:04.203 --> 35:06.603
- What's wrong?
- Wrong?

35:08.641 --> 35:10.666
What could possibly go wrong?

35:11.644 --> 35:15.273
Guys, I think I can explain.

35:25.556 --> 35:27.285
<i>It is now 2:12am</i>

35:27.324 --> 35:30.452
<i>and the full force of Hurricane Kukana
has struck Oahu.</i>

35:30.494 --> 35:32.553
<i>All power and phone lines are out</i>

35:32.596 --> 35:35.463
<i>and damage is reportedly
widespread and extensive</i>

35:35.499 --> 35:38.627
<i>but because of the almost total
breakdown in communications</i>

35:38.669 --> 35:42.400
<i>we can't verify any reports
of injuries or property damage</i>

35:42.439 --> 35:46.535
<i>and as far as we know,
we here at KDIM are the last station...</i>

35:53.016 --> 35:56.508
Now, please calm down.
There is no need to panic.

35:56.553 --> 35:59.716
- But she's yelling and screaming.
- She's well into labor.

35:59.756 --> 36:03.658
Her water has broken. Congratulations.
You're about to become a father.

36:03.694 --> 36:06.663
Jeez. What am I supposed to do, Doc?

36:06.697 --> 36:10.963
Fortunately for everyone, you don't need
to do anything except comfort your wife.

36:11.001 --> 36:13.663
- Well, go.
- <i>O</i> h, yeah. Thanks.

36:19.710 --> 36:23.441
- We're gonna die! I know it!
- Will you shut up?

36:24.514 --> 36:27.381
Rollie, did you hear
what that witch said to me?

36:28.185 --> 36:33.987
Rollie, do something about it.
I'm your wife. I'm the princess of Tervia.

36:34.024 --> 36:35.651
Wanda, shut up.

36:35.692 --> 36:38.160
Guys, guys, please.

36:38.195 --> 36:41.562
Will everybody just take it easy, please?

36:41.598 --> 36:46.228
Rick and T.C. can nail everything
down and we can sit tight.

36:46.270 --> 36:49.933
It's the best we can do.
It's the only thing we can do.

36:52.442 --> 36:54.000
We're gonna die, I know it!

36:54.044 --> 36:57.502
- Lady...
- Shut up!

36:57.547 --> 37:00.914
- Come on, Rick. You got that, T.C.?
- Yeah, I got it.

37:02.653 --> 37:06.646
Rick, do something about that window.
Magnum, put this water on to boil.

37:06.690 --> 37:10.353
- Boil water. I saw that in a movie once.
- Rick, please!

37:10.394 --> 37:12.487
You sure you know what you're doing?

37:12.529 --> 37:16.021
I know precisely what I'm doing.

37:16.066 --> 37:18.830
It's time.
Scrub up, lads, and join me in the den.

37:18.869 --> 37:23.033
Wait. What about the guy that's supposed
to kill Robin? What are we supposed to do?

37:23.073 --> 37:25.541
Nothing. The baby's coming. Mr. Masters isn't.

37:25.575 --> 37:29.272
Wait. Will you just wait, Higgins? That's just it.

37:29.313 --> 37:32.339
- Robin is already here.
- What?

37:32.382 --> 37:36.250
He's been here all along.

37:36.286 --> 37:39.380
And you didn't tell me?
What the bloody hell is that?

37:39.423 --> 37:41.948
- A Walther PPK.
- I know that.

37:41.992 --> 37:45.223
Like I said, no one here
has ever really been in any danger.

37:45.262 --> 37:49.255
What about me, staring down
the barrel of a 12-gauge shotgun?

37:49.299 --> 37:52.564
<i>O</i> h. Good point. Nobody's perfect.

37:52.602 --> 37:55.469
Anyway don't worry, Higgins.
I have another plan.

37:55.505 --> 37:56.972
Perfect, no doubt.

38:09.586 --> 38:11.520
- Wanda.
- Yeah?

38:11.555 --> 38:14.752
- <i>O</i> h, er, I mean Your Highness.
- Yeah?

38:14.791 --> 38:17.419
- Where is everybody?
- Gone.

38:18.995 --> 38:20.986
Where?

38:21.031 --> 38:26.901
I don't know. Not my night to watch.
The storm probably blew 'em away.

38:26.937 --> 38:30.134
Your Highness, I need your help.

38:30.173 --> 38:33.574
You need help? We all need help.

38:33.610 --> 38:36.807
We're all gonna die here. Drown like rats.

38:37.748 --> 38:41.775
Yes. Your Highness, may I be direct with you?

38:45.222 --> 38:48.020
I don't know. What did you have in mind?

38:50.894 --> 38:54.762
Look. Um... I'm a private investigator

38:54.798 --> 38:59.497
and I have been retained for the express
purpose of protecting Robin Masters' life.

39:01.271 --> 39:04.138
What's to protect? He's not even here.

39:04.174 --> 39:07.109
Yes, he is, Your Highness.
He's here in the house.

39:07.144 --> 39:12.980
And I have information
that one of the guests... is trying to kill him.

39:16.286 --> 39:18.846
Kill him? The party wasn't that bad.

39:20.824 --> 39:27.024
Look. You can help me by just keeping
your eyes and ears open. I trust you.

39:29.232 --> 39:33.794
I'm going to try and round everybody else up
and get them back in here, <i>O</i> K?

39:33.837 --> 39:36.738
Sure. No problem.

39:38.275 --> 39:43.645
Hey, Mr. Private Investigator.
Where do you have him hidden?

39:49.219 --> 39:51.847
Upstairs. In the bedroom.

40:09.539 --> 40:10.938
Pssst!

40:10.974 --> 40:14.603
- You startled me, laddie.
- Sorry, Mr. MacPherson.

40:14.644 --> 40:17.579
- Listen, you got a minute?
- Aye, plenty of them.

40:18.515 --> 40:21.450
I'm a private investigator.
I'm retained by your boss.

40:21.485 --> 40:23.817
Somebody at this party is trying to kill him.

40:23.854 --> 40:27.017
He asked me to tell you
he's stashed upstairs in his bedroom.

40:27.057 --> 40:28.854
Here's what I'd like you to do.

40:32.462 --> 40:35.989
Duke. I need your help.

40:37.400 --> 40:40.301
What are you talking about?
You got the punk, didn't you?

40:40.337 --> 40:44.398
Yeah, but not whoever is out to kill Robin.

40:44.441 --> 40:46.102
What?

40:46.142 --> 40:48.133
Look, I'm a private investigator

40:48.178 --> 40:52.410
and I'm retained for the express purpose
of protecting Robin Masters' life.

40:52.449 --> 40:54.883
But Robbie is not here.

40:58.355 --> 41:00.516
That's what everybody thinks.

41:10.066 --> 41:12.057
Prince, that you?

41:14.304 --> 41:18.741
Well, I'm a private investigator
retained by Robin Masters.

41:27.751 --> 41:31.619
Remember,
Robin trusts you. Not a word to anyone.

41:31.655 --> 41:34.055
I promise, darling.

41:35.358 --> 41:37.724
This entire episode reminds me so much

41:37.761 --> 41:40.889
of the plot of one of Robin's earlier works,

41:40.931 --> 41:43.627
Blood <i>O</i> f The August Kitten.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.498
Mm.

41:45.535 --> 41:47.526
Where do you have him?

41:49.639 --> 41:51.630
If you can't tell me...

41:53.209 --> 41:55.871
Upstairs. In the bedroom.

41:57.314 --> 41:59.305
How appropriate.

42:15.098 --> 42:17.760
Ah! Goodness! Don't do that!

42:19.135 --> 42:23.003
You know better
than to sneak up on the back of me like that.

42:28.211 --> 42:30.338
Keep it up. Steady as you go.

42:30.380 --> 42:32.439
Now, breathe regularly.

42:33.984 --> 42:35.975
That's it.

42:36.019 --> 42:40.046
Now, one, two, three, blow. That's it.

42:40.757 --> 42:42.486
That's it, baby. That's it.

42:43.393 --> 42:46.123
- How's it going?
- <i>O</i> ur plan is doing fine. Yours?

42:46.162 --> 42:49.393
- It's all set.
- I'm going to need some assistance.

42:51.468 --> 42:53.868
Well, sounds like it's time to go to work.

42:53.903 --> 42:56.667
- You gonna be all right?
- Quite. Get on with your plan.

42:56.706 --> 42:59.106
Right. Bye. Good luck.

43:00.977 --> 43:02.968
Here. Right here.

43:04.648 --> 43:08.209
I need some water. She's sweating
pretty bad. Gonna be all right.

43:21.064 --> 43:23.532
Push. Push.

43:25.669 --> 43:27.933
Relax. Now breathe.

43:31.307 --> 43:33.901
- Sounds good.
- Now, relax.

43:35.679 --> 43:37.442
Now breathe.

43:38.448 --> 43:41.906
Now push <i>. O</i> ne, two, three, push.
That's it, push.

43:44.087 --> 43:46.078
Fine, now relax.

43:47.123 --> 43:49.887
Now push.

43:49.926 --> 43:53.987
<i>O</i> ne, two, three, push, push. That's it.

43:54.030 --> 43:56.294
- I can't. I can't.
- You must.

43:56.332 --> 43:58.766
Push. I can see it.
I can see the baby's head.

43:58.802 --> 44:02.568
- I can't believe it!
- Come on, lady, you can do it.

44:02.605 --> 44:06.598
- Push, push!
- Push! Push! Push!

44:28.631 --> 44:30.690
Aaah... Coochy-coochy-coo.

44:30.734 --> 44:32.565
Coochy-coochy-coo?

44:32.602 --> 44:36.629
Already you're severely jeopardizing
the child's emotional development.

44:36.673 --> 44:40.803
- It's bad enough that you're holding him.
- Lighten up, Higgie baby.

44:40.844 --> 44:43.244
Rick gets along fine with kids and babies.

44:43.279 --> 44:45.839
They share many of the same characteristics.

44:45.882 --> 44:48.476
Come on, you guys.

44:48.518 --> 44:51.316
Yeah, she's right.
What are you guys gonna name him?

45:05.068 --> 45:07.502
- <i>O</i> h, my God.
- What? What?

45:07.537 --> 45:12.065
- She's going to have another child.
- <i>O</i> h, my God.

45:39.602 --> 45:41.661
That's no way to treat an old friend.

45:46.442 --> 45:48.910
Why?

45:48.945 --> 45:55.111
Paris, March 1957. Rue Des Chanteuses.

45:55.151 --> 45:58.678
My dear, that was all
a terrible misunderstanding.

45:58.721 --> 46:01.554
- If I could just explain.
- No.

46:03.126 --> 46:05.526
- No, I couldn't bear it.
- Please.

46:09.999 --> 46:11.990
That will be all, thank you.

46:36.960 --> 46:40.123
- Congratulations, young man.
- Thanks, Doc.

46:40.997 --> 46:43.488
I mean, thanks a lot.

46:43.533 --> 46:46.001
<i>O</i> h, boy, honey,
this is gonna be a lot of diapers.

46:48.171 --> 46:50.833
I hope you're out of jail soon
to enjoy your sons.

46:53.543 --> 46:56.137
- Would you like to hold the lads?
- Yes.

46:56.880 --> 46:58.074
Gentlemen.

47:10.493 --> 47:14.088
- What are you gonna call them?
- That's gonna be Louis Junior.

47:14.130 --> 47:17.327
And this little guy right here
is gonna be named

47:17.367 --> 47:22.430
Jonathan Thomas Orville
Theodore Blassingame.

47:22.472 --> 47:24.633
What?

47:24.674 --> 47:29.338
Speaking of lads, Higgins,
where are your lads?

47:53.636 --> 47:56.230
<i>O</i> h, my God!
