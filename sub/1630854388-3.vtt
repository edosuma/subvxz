WEBVTT

00:22.397 --> 00:23.481
What is that?

00:23.565 --> 00:24.441
That you?

00:29.946 --> 00:31.281
That you, batty batty?

00:37.162 --> 00:39.205
Get back! Get back! Get off me!

00:39.289 --> 00:41.624
Those damn twins and their damn pranks!

00:46.588 --> 00:47.464
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:55.180 --> 00:58.808
Don't worry, we're not infested.
It's Carol's twin grandsons.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.518
They've been pranking us for weeks.

01:00.602 --> 01:03.938
Gluing the mailbox shut,
lubing the floor, setting off car alarms.

01:04.022 --> 01:05.607
-Who's Carol?
-You know.

01:05.690 --> 01:08.902
Vests, kind of scary.
She owns Hot Piece of Bass.

01:08.985 --> 01:11.696
When will you change
the employee photos back?

01:11.780 --> 01:13.823
I like the Buscemis staring at me.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.951
Makes me feel like I'm in
an unproduced Charlie Kaufman movie.

01:17.035 --> 01:20.413
The twins hid a beehive in my store again.

01:20.497 --> 01:25.293
Classic Carol's grandsons.
I better get going.

01:25.376 --> 01:28.254
Have to give some kisses
to my bearded dragons.

01:28.338 --> 01:32.050
We gotta retaliate. How do we top
the eyebrow scar we gave Evan?

01:32.133 --> 01:36.471
That was Trevin, and that was on him for
having so many fishing lures on his hat.

01:36.554 --> 01:40.975
We find a way to give them one of
the less permanent versions of hepatitis.

01:41.059 --> 01:45.313
I love that. Diarrhea, the other symptoms,
but not the full hepatitis.

01:46.856 --> 01:48.441
Actually, I'm out.

01:49.609 --> 01:50.652
-What?
-Look,

01:50.735 --> 01:52.779
Halloween is our biggest time of the year,

01:52.862 --> 01:55.907
with people looking for horror movies
they can't get on streamers.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.325
This year will be bigger

01:57.408 --> 01:59.911
because of publicity
from that news report.

01:59.994 --> 02:02.705
Look around.
We haven't had this many customers

02:02.789 --> 02:05.333
since <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i>
made the whole country horny.

02:05.416 --> 02:08.753
I'm not gonna jeopardize that
by getting into a prank war with children.

02:08.837 --> 02:10.880
We're this close
to getting out of the woods.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.924
You're two months behind on rent.

02:13.007 --> 02:14.926
-Oh.
-Damn. I'm torn.

02:15.009 --> 02:17.178
The half of me
that wants my money is impressed.

02:17.262 --> 02:22.100
But the half of me that wants to put
two ninth graders in a hospital is bummed.

02:22.183 --> 02:24.686
I like this new Timmy. Let's support him.

02:24.769 --> 02:26.729
He's trying to be a responsible boss.

02:28.815 --> 02:29.649
What is that?

02:42.328 --> 02:44.164
Glitter bomb. Damn it.

02:44.247 --> 02:47.375
-Impressive, though.
-I think it scratched my cornea.

02:47.458 --> 02:48.835
So you summon ghosts?

02:48.918 --> 02:52.338
No, <i>Día de los Muertos</i>
isn't about ghosts exactly.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.382
They're spirits of dead relatives

02:54.465 --> 02:56.843
who come back to visit for one night.

02:56.926 --> 02:58.970
Oh, so zombies then.

02:59.053 --> 03:00.096
Not zombies.

03:00.889 --> 03:03.224
Fine, if I have to choose,
more ghosts than zombies.

03:03.308 --> 03:04.934
It's more of a spiritual reunion.

03:05.018 --> 03:08.146
You put offerings out
to welcome your lost loved ones,

03:08.229 --> 03:12.609
like their photo and favorite things,
so they find their way back to you.

03:12.692 --> 03:16.029
So they take a bite out of cookies
like Santa Claus.

03:16.112 --> 03:16.946
Nope.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.658
Still more ghosts than Santa.
Maybe it's easier if I show you.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.660
Do you wanna make an <i>ofrenda</i> for your mom?

03:22.744 --> 03:25.330
-That would be really cool.
-Happy to do it.

03:25.413 --> 03:26.831
What did your mom like?

03:26.915 --> 03:29.209
Skirts that were secretly shorts.

03:29.292 --> 03:30.710
Amen to that.

03:31.586 --> 03:34.422
But I mean more like
what was her favorite food?

03:34.505 --> 03:37.091
Bugles. They had them
at the hospital where she worked.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.677
Well, volunteered.
She was a candy striper.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.888
-Do you have any photos?
-Yeah.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.516
This is one of my faves.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.060
Oh, she was so young.

03:47.727 --> 03:50.897
If you don't mind me asking,
what happened to her?

03:50.980 --> 03:51.814
She died.

03:52.815 --> 03:53.942
Sure.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.902
But... how?

03:56.569 --> 03:58.154
It's kind of embarrassing.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.989
I'm not totally sure.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.117
I was super young,
and any time I ask my dad,

04:03.201 --> 04:06.871
he says he's gonna grab a beer
and then goes on a 4-mile walk.

04:06.955 --> 04:07.914
Men are limited.

04:10.541 --> 04:12.752
Okay, it's just you and me, the boys.

04:12.835 --> 04:14.587
How do we get back at the twins?

04:14.671 --> 04:19.509
Ooh. How about we make it about
the psychological instead of the physical?

04:19.592 --> 04:20.760
Kids are sponges.

04:20.843 --> 04:23.429
We gotta scar
the little bastards for life.

04:23.513 --> 04:24.847
No, I'm serious.

04:24.931 --> 04:25.932
I've changed.

04:26.015 --> 04:27.892
-You have changed.
-Hey.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.477
I wasn't scared.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.105
So, hi. Yes, Eliza?

04:32.188 --> 04:35.024
I brought you a new shirt
since yours is covered in glitter.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.443
Uh-oh. Shirt alert. Whoop, whoop!

04:37.527 --> 04:40.697
The shirt alert's going off
'cause there is a shirt in my hands.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.282
You're welcome.

04:44.742 --> 04:47.745
-What is all that?

04:47.829 --> 04:49.289
Look, I don't know, man.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.874
Ever since I admitted I liked her
and almost told her,

04:51.958 --> 04:52.959
sometimes it's fine,

04:53.042 --> 04:55.962
then other times I look at her
and I don't know how to act.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.006
Does this seem normal to you?

05:01.301 --> 05:02.260
Uh...

05:03.344 --> 05:04.178
No?

05:04.762 --> 05:05.596
Here we go.

05:06.472 --> 05:07.307
Hi, Eliza.

05:07.390 --> 05:10.101
You look like you're in a nest
keeping your eggs warm.

05:10.184 --> 05:11.185
How about this?

05:14.605 --> 05:15.440
No?

05:17.817 --> 05:18.651
Okay.

05:19.819 --> 05:21.779
-Hi, Eliza.
-Do a school photo.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.657
Okay.
Okay, now let me see a straight ahead one.

05:26.409 --> 05:27.243
No.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.494
Halloween.

05:29.787 --> 05:32.081
<i>Return of the Stepmother. Twenty--</i>

05:34.125 --> 05:37.795
Timmy. Please stop buying lightbulbs
from Facebook Marketplace.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.797
Wattage has a minus
in front of the number.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.763
Didn't mean to scare you. Hi, I'm Damon.

05:46.846 --> 05:49.307
I'm gonna be helping
with the Halloween curation.

05:49.390 --> 05:51.726
Hi. I'm Carlos.

05:51.809 --> 05:54.562
I'll handle the curating myself
like always.

05:54.645 --> 05:56.272
-Thanks.
-That's perfect.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.150
We can just do it by ourselves,
side by side.

05:59.233 --> 06:00.485
Oh, really?

06:00.568 --> 06:02.236
Oh, cool. Yeah. Timmy!

06:02.320 --> 06:04.614
Do you know if we carry
the butthole cut of <i>Cats?</i>

06:07.200 --> 06:09.327
Last night's <i>Dateline</i> was epic.

06:09.410 --> 06:12.872
Ugh! I missed it.
My husband had his fight club over

06:12.955 --> 06:16.709
so it was all setting down coasters
and stitching up eyebrows.

06:17.543 --> 06:20.880
You know how the last few episodes
have been so boring?

06:20.963 --> 06:24.133
Man has affair with a 19-year-old hostess
at a fast-casual,

06:24.217 --> 06:27.804
murders his wife, cries about it in court,
and says, "I'm a good Christian man."

06:27.887 --> 06:29.389
-Snooze.
-Wake up, people,

06:29.472 --> 06:32.558
because they finally
gave us a serial killer.

06:32.642 --> 06:33.601
One from here.

06:33.684 --> 06:35.686
Oh, Jesus is good.

06:35.770 --> 06:38.689
"The Shadow Lake Killer,"
and this guy had a type.

06:38.773 --> 06:43.694
All his victims were 5'9", candy stripers,
and, get this, natural redheads.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.905
Why redheads? I heard they're crazy.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.866
-Not you. You seem cool.
-What's this?

06:48.950 --> 06:51.077
An <i>ofrenda</i> for Hannah's mom.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.454
I'm trying to teach her
about <i>Día de los Muertos.</i>

06:53.538 --> 06:57.333
But she's Hannah. Her only reference
for the afterlife includes Kristen Bell.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.920
-Wait, so Hannah's mom was a redhead.
-And a candy striper.

07:01.003 --> 07:04.882
Wai-- Oh, God. What if she's a victim
of the shadow lake killer?

07:04.966 --> 07:08.553
He had four confirmed kills,
but they suspect dozens more.

07:08.636 --> 07:11.973
I mean, maybe?
Hannah doesn't know how she died.

07:12.056 --> 07:13.391
-No.
-No, be real.

07:13.474 --> 07:15.893
We've seen too much <i>Dateline,</i>
which isn't a criticism.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.521
-We have to cut it with <i>48 Hours.</i>
-Yeah.

07:18.604 --> 07:22.567
My mom loved blueberries,
especially the wild ones at Shadow Lake.

07:24.026 --> 07:25.278
Shadow Lake?

07:25.361 --> 07:27.113
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

07:27.196 --> 07:30.366
So question,
why did you hire someone to do my job?

07:30.450 --> 07:34.078
Oh. Damon's an unpaid intern.
Actually, it was his idea.

07:34.162 --> 07:37.623
We met at Hollywood Harold's estate sale,
got to talking.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.250
I thought you'd make a great team.

07:39.333 --> 07:42.336
There's no I in "team,"
and that's the problem.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.338
-I work alone.
-It's a busy time.

07:44.422 --> 07:45.465
Free help is free help.

07:45.548 --> 07:48.926
I know Damon has good taste
because I have good taste.

07:49.010 --> 07:52.096
We were both bidding on Hollywood Harold's
vintage horror collection.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.474
-Damon's a horror expert.
-No, I am.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.852
I'm an expert in all things cinema,
even movies Kevin Hart tries to hide.

07:57.935 --> 08:02.482
Harold's Estate has original film print
of <i>Freddy vs. Jason,</i> non-canonical,

08:02.565 --> 08:04.150
not even in theaters.

08:04.942 --> 08:07.320
-You guys haven't seen it.
-I've seen it.

08:07.403 --> 08:08.654
-Oh, you have?
-Mm-hm.

08:10.781 --> 08:12.074
Of course I haven't.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.951
Those twins are so annoying,

08:14.035 --> 08:16.913
but I'm really glad Timmy
is insisting we take the high road.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.080
Mm.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.544
Oh, those dick twins!

08:25.046 --> 08:26.130
Awesome.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.965
It's side-boob. Calm down.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.135
Do you want me to...?

08:33.804 --> 08:35.473
What do they even get out of that?

08:35.556 --> 08:37.642
Screw the high road. Game on.

08:37.725 --> 08:40.520
-We are pranking those dicks back.
-Wait, what?

08:40.603 --> 08:42.355
It's Johnny Rastrelli all over again.

08:42.438 --> 08:43.606
A new pizza arcade?

08:43.689 --> 08:45.775
No. My childhood nemesis.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.027
Johnny Rastrelli
would mess with me constantly.

08:48.110 --> 08:49.529
My mom never let me retaliate.

08:49.612 --> 08:52.615
Now I'm supposed to sit back
and watch him run for Senate?

08:52.698 --> 08:53.699
I don't think so!

08:53.783 --> 08:57.119
-I'll kill you.
-You liked that we weren't pranking back,

08:57.203 --> 09:00.081
so we probably
shouldn't prank back, right?

09:00.164 --> 09:01.874
Because that's what you said.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.378
Connie, it's the most obvious answer.

09:05.461 --> 09:08.506
The most obvious answer
is it's always the husband.

09:08.589 --> 09:12.218
Okay, fine. But the second
most obvious answer, serial killer.

09:12.301 --> 09:14.303
Let's do a little digging.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.722
A little <i>Dateline</i> sleuthing of our own?

09:16.806 --> 09:18.724
Always thought I'd be a great Lester Holt.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.143
Then I'm Keith Morrison. Hannah!

09:21.227 --> 09:24.981
Han, Han, Han. Quick question.
What's your favorite lunch place?

09:25.064 --> 09:27.817
What's the deal with Shadow Lake?
Have a place? Rent a place?

09:27.900 --> 09:30.444
How are the inroads, outroads? Dish, girl.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.530
In answer to your first question,

09:32.613 --> 09:35.449
this mom-and-pop shop near my house
called Jersey Mike's.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.659
Oh! Mm.

09:36.742 --> 09:40.246
And second, we lived there.
You can see it in this picture.

09:40.329 --> 09:43.791
-Your mom was so tall. Was she a model?
-She was, 5'9".

09:43.874 --> 09:46.711
Not tall enough for runway.
But imagine if she had IG.

09:46.794 --> 09:47.628
Excuse me.

09:48.212 --> 09:49.505
I'll get it.

09:51.299 --> 09:54.093
-There's a lot of similarities, but--
-Look.

09:54.176 --> 09:56.262
This lanky ginger's holding a book.

09:56.345 --> 09:59.265
All the Shadow Lake Slayer's victims
were reading when they died.

09:59.348 --> 10:02.268
That's why they almost called him
the Shadow Lake Librarian.

10:02.351 --> 10:05.104
Do you watch it over lunch? Oh!

10:05.187 --> 10:08.357
How about water balloons?
Classic yet effective.

10:08.441 --> 10:12.069
How about instead of water,
we fill them with rancid mustard?

10:12.153 --> 10:14.322
I know a breakroom fridge
that's lousy with it.

10:14.405 --> 10:18.034
I'm gonna piggyback off your piggyback.
We sell cop costumes.

10:18.117 --> 10:19.827
We pose as police officers,

10:19.910 --> 10:22.455
tell them their parents
got into a terrible accident.

10:22.538 --> 10:23.539
Ho, ho, ho!

10:24.081 --> 10:25.708
Maybe we draw the line at felonies.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.335
Oh, look who's here.

10:27.418 --> 10:30.046
It's the hall monitor
here to "bust things up."

10:30.129 --> 10:32.590
Where's your little sash, hall monitor?

10:32.673 --> 10:34.592
I'm not a hall monitor anymore.

10:34.675 --> 10:36.218
I mean, ever, now.

10:36.302 --> 10:39.513
Ooh! I was in the PTA
with a dad who builds paintball guns.

10:39.597 --> 10:43.059
We have to think Michelle Obama.
What would Shelly O do?

10:43.142 --> 10:47.313
Never called herself that.
Anyway, how much mustard are we packing?

10:47.396 --> 10:48.481
Everything we got.

10:48.564 --> 10:50.941
Mustard instead of water? That's genius.

10:51.442 --> 10:52.526
No. High road.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.820
As fun as that sounds,
I have to be responsible.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.364
Don't wanna get written up.

10:57.239 --> 11:00.242
That's from the hall monitor thing
from before.

11:00.326 --> 11:03.037
We'll make sure none of it
gets traced to you.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.039
Put your sash on, look official.

11:06.123 --> 11:08.918
Great. That's exactly what I wanted.

11:18.552 --> 11:21.097
You consider yourself
a horror movie expert?

11:21.180 --> 11:23.474
Oh, yeah, I'm an expert.

11:23.557 --> 11:26.519
-What's the first horror movie ever made?
<i>-The House of the Devil.</i>

11:26.602 --> 11:28.145
Ha! Wrong. <i>The Devil's Manor.</i>

11:28.229 --> 11:29.939
If it's the American translation.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.858
-Name of the demon from <i>The Exorcist?</i>
-Pazuzu. Everybody knows.

11:32.942 --> 11:35.152
Right. Obviously, duh. I knew that too.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.988
Well, I got a birthday Cameo
from the guy that played Jigsaw.

11:38.072 --> 11:41.117
No way.
Hey, Neve Campbell spilled milk on me.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.036
I met an actual Slenderman. Yeah.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.665
Wait until you see my Halloween costume.
It's not gonna suck.

11:48.874 --> 11:49.792
Just a little--

11:51.711 --> 11:52.795
Uh-huh.

11:53.295 --> 11:56.298
Ma, I can't be your date to your
retirement home's Halloween party.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.384
My store is gonna be packed today.

11:59.343 --> 12:01.345
Sorry, retirement resort.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.974
Yeah. Yes, I know.
I was a very difficult birth.

12:06.475 --> 12:07.476
Oh, no.

12:08.185 --> 12:09.228
Uh...

12:09.645 --> 12:10.813
Those dick twins.

12:12.189 --> 12:13.691
Uh, I'll call you back.

12:28.164 --> 12:31.250
How much for the ice cream fridge,
without ice cream?

12:31.333 --> 12:32.334
It's not for sale.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.295
-What about with ice cream?
-Not for sale.

12:34.378 --> 12:37.339
This has been
and continues to be a video rental store.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.592
-How much to rent ice cream?
-Leave.

12:40.593 --> 12:44.555
Okay, new store policy.
When they go low, we go lower.

12:44.638 --> 12:46.891
-It's a limbo contest now.
-Stand down.

12:46.974 --> 12:49.810
Me and Percy are on it.
we'll take the sign down.

12:49.894 --> 12:53.147
The damage is already done
to the store and doughnuts.

12:53.230 --> 12:55.441
Well, I'm already stuffed.

12:55.524 --> 12:58.819
Aaron found that breakfast sandwich truck
that doesn't post its location.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.988
-The Bermuda Truck-Angle?
-Yeah.

13:01.071 --> 13:04.366
Wow, what a man. What a mighty good man.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.995
I don't think Salt-N-Pepa
is writing songs about him yet,

13:08.078 --> 13:11.081
but he has been trying
since we got back together.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.166
Mm.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.877
Dinosaur with glasses?

13:14.960 --> 13:16.170
Clever girl.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.714
<i>Jurassic Park.</i> You got it. Don't tell me.

13:18.798 --> 13:23.010
-Uh, <i>Greatest Showman?</i>
-I'm clearly Murphy Brown.

13:23.093 --> 13:26.931
I'm gonna go smear butter on my hand,
try to get this off.

13:28.015 --> 13:30.267
Jennifer Coolidge is better than this.

13:34.772 --> 13:36.315
Why is it so warm?

13:39.109 --> 13:40.569
Why is it so warm?

13:42.947 --> 13:44.156
That does it.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.492
This is my house and I will defend it.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.286
Come on.

13:49.954 --> 13:52.873
Is your costume
from a vampire throuple movie?

13:52.957 --> 13:53.791
<i>Twilight?</i>

13:53.874 --> 13:56.001
Hurtful. No, it's <i>Dracula.</i>

13:56.085 --> 13:59.797
Most people go the 1931 version
and Lugosi's a genius, obvi.

13:59.880 --> 14:04.969
But this is the little seen 1979 version.
It's pretty niche stuff.

14:05.553 --> 14:06.887
-Oh, God.

14:07.596 --> 14:08.931
Scary, right?

14:09.014 --> 14:11.350
I guess it's not so niche.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.656
Think he's trying
to <i>Single White Female</i> you?

14:25.739 --> 14:28.367
I mean <i>Single Brown Male</i> you?
I didn't mean to whitewash.

14:28.450 --> 14:31.954
I worked too hard on this costume
for this freak to copy it.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.914
Freak in, like, a hot way?

14:33.998 --> 14:38.752
Hot? Maybe in like a Tim Burton,
Jack Skellington sort of way.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.838
Skellington had legs for days.

14:40.921 --> 14:41.797
Not the time.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.132
Look at us.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.384
We're identical twins, right?

14:51.599 --> 14:54.393
I know the map is of Raging Waters,
but it's crystal clear.

14:54.476 --> 14:57.438
I'm so glad Hannah's mom
has us to solve her case.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.023
What is this? Who cares?

14:59.106 --> 15:01.775
I'm going full-prank John Wick
on those twins.

15:01.859 --> 15:02.818
-Cool.
-Okay.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.111
It is cool.

15:04.194 --> 15:06.196
I am not staying out of the fray.

15:06.280 --> 15:09.366
I know how to save a life
because I am The Fray.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.119
The band, The Fray.

15:12.202 --> 15:14.955
Come on,
watch one episode of <i>Grey's Anatomy.</i>

15:15.039 --> 15:16.332
I'm going into Carol's store

15:16.415 --> 15:19.585
to plant stink bombs
in the twins' backpacks.

15:19.668 --> 15:23.255
-Show Eliza and Percy how it's done.
-That's a terrible plan.

15:23.339 --> 15:26.592
The twins are expecting retaliation
and they're watching the doors.

15:26.675 --> 15:29.678
I'm going in through the roof.
Carol has a skylight.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.096
Come on, let's go.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.561
He keeps stink bombs in his office?

15:37.645 --> 15:41.440
Preston, I'm telling you.
It's got thrills, chills,

15:41.523 --> 15:44.610
and the highest concentration
of Wayans outside of their mom's house.

15:44.693 --> 15:47.905
<i>-Scary Movie 2.</i>
-You know what I think you'd like more.

15:47.988 --> 15:51.158
-Ooh.<i> Scary Movie 4.</i>
-Ha. You just picked a higher number.

15:51.241 --> 15:54.828
-That has no Wayans in it.
-Shaquille O'Neal and Dr. Phil.

15:56.205 --> 15:59.041
-And characters inspired by the Wayans?
-Yeah.

15:59.124 --> 16:00.542
-This seems good.
-Right?

16:00.626 --> 16:02.252
My guy.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.338
-Yo! Yes!
-Want some free popcorn?

16:08.926 --> 16:10.636
Hey, so is Timmy okay?

16:10.719 --> 16:13.389
Seems like the stress
of the store's really getting to him.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.933
Something is definitely getting to him.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.142
Hmm.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.437
-Were you an Eagle Scout?
-Yeah.

16:20.521 --> 16:24.608
Up until our scoutmaster got fired
for turning us into cocaine hippos.

16:24.692 --> 16:27.486
-Yikes. I could tell.
-Oh, yeah, he was a trip.

16:27.569 --> 16:31.865
It's a hell of a balloon knot.
Working together is kind of nice.

16:31.949 --> 16:35.703
If I can't hang with my boy Tim,
you make a decent bench player.

16:35.786 --> 16:38.080
-Thank you.
-Normally when I'm with you

16:38.163 --> 16:41.000
it's like all the bad parts
about being married.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.461
-But this has been fun.
-I got it.

16:45.587 --> 16:48.340
Ooh, ooh. There they are. Revenge is ours.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.175
-Revenge is ours.
-Let's go.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.137
Ugh. Why did I wear heels?

16:54.221 --> 16:56.181
Stop jiggling those. You look like a perv.

17:16.744 --> 17:17.870
Ow!

17:17.953 --> 17:20.414
-What the hell just happened?

17:22.041 --> 17:22.875
Help!

17:24.168 --> 17:25.544
Ooh!

17:40.142 --> 17:40.976
Hey.

17:41.477 --> 17:44.605
Just cleaning myself
after falling through a skylight.

17:44.688 --> 17:47.399
You know, normal stuff.
Please tell me Carol--

17:47.483 --> 17:50.235
She just reaggravated
an old hunting injury.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.071
She says she's totally fine.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.989
She's drunk, but I believe her.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.449
I should've stayed out of it,

17:55.532 --> 17:59.036
but I couldn't let those jerks
keep getting the best of us.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.204
I'm so stupid.

18:00.287 --> 18:03.874
So stupid. This easily
makes your top five dumb things.

18:03.957 --> 18:07.044
In high school you sunburned
the Grateful Dead bear on your forehead.

18:07.127 --> 18:09.046
-I stand by that decision.

18:09.588 --> 18:14.176
So I told Carol
that the twins crashed the skylight.

18:14.259 --> 18:18.180
She's sending those little buttholes
to reform school. Last laugh.

18:18.263 --> 18:19.640
What did you do?

18:19.723 --> 18:22.601
Well, if friends can't depend
on each other for revenge,

18:22.684 --> 18:23.685
what's the point?

18:24.394 --> 18:27.189
Plus, you can't have blood on your hands.
You're the boss.

18:28.148 --> 18:28.982
Thanks.

18:29.066 --> 18:29.900
Yeah.

18:35.823 --> 18:36.657
Hey.

18:47.501 --> 18:51.505
-What the hell is your problem?
-Oh. Well, I'm allergic to tree nuts.

18:51.588 --> 18:54.424
Gluten wrecks me.
The sun and are not friends--

18:54.508 --> 18:56.301
No, you keep stealing my customers,

18:56.385 --> 19:00.055
jacked my Halloween costume,
and try to out movie knowledge me.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.098
Why?

19:02.266 --> 19:04.977
Well, because I like you.

19:08.605 --> 19:10.149
So that was you flirting?

19:10.232 --> 19:13.902
I guess I'm good with movies
but not so good with boys.

19:13.986 --> 19:17.072
I wouldn't say that. You do have
a David Arquette in <i>Scream</i> appeal.

19:24.746 --> 19:27.291
Wait.
I know we're making out in the closet,

19:27.374 --> 19:30.544
but I'm not in the closet.
Openly bisexual and proud.

19:30.627 --> 19:34.047
Just so you know,
I don't mind we're in a confined space.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.050
Claustrophiliac, population me.

19:37.759 --> 19:39.219
Mm. Okay.

19:39.845 --> 19:42.097
We can't tell Hannah the truth.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.558
Why not? It's what <i>Dateline's</i> all about.

19:44.641 --> 19:47.978
Delivering terrible news under the guise
of helping the family find peace.

19:48.061 --> 19:50.230
What if she wants
to devote her life to revenge?

19:50.314 --> 19:53.358
You think the girl who paints
her fingernails with dinosaur stickers

19:53.442 --> 19:56.612
-has the follow-through for revenge?
-She might.

19:56.695 --> 20:01.700
Come on. Hannah, there's something
we need to tell you about your mom.

20:01.783 --> 20:04.578
-No, but before you do, you need to--
-Ew. Gross.

20:04.661 --> 20:08.707
My mom hated reading.
She always said movies were faster.

20:08.790 --> 20:12.377
-In this photo she's holding a book.
-Grandma got it for her.

20:12.461 --> 20:15.047
She was going to throw it in the lake.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.298
She hated reading.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.091
-Hated, hated, hated.
-Got it.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.428
Then we have nothing else to say.

20:21.511 --> 20:23.347
Thanks for this, Connie.

20:23.430 --> 20:25.974
It's nice to feel so close to my mom.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.142
Happy to help.

20:29.686 --> 20:31.688
That was almost really bad.

20:31.772 --> 20:34.274
Almost really bad is the story of my life.

20:35.150 --> 20:38.362
But, hey, even though
Hannah's mom didn't get murdered,

20:38.445 --> 20:41.615
at least she got the spirit
of <i>Día de los Muertos.</i>

20:41.698 --> 20:44.910
And she left her a note.

20:44.993 --> 20:47.079
"Hi, Mom, it's Hannah.

20:47.162 --> 20:48.956
Love you and miss you.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.707
Should I get bangs?

20:50.791 --> 20:52.334
Circle 'yes' or 'no.'"

20:54.044 --> 20:55.879
We're telling her no, right?

20:55.963 --> 20:57.589
Hannah can't have bangs.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.299
Her face is like a hexagon.

21:02.552 --> 21:05.764
Hey, man. I am so sorry about all this.

21:05.847 --> 21:09.101
I know you're responsible for the damage,
but I'll take care of it.

21:09.184 --> 21:11.019
It's fine. I got it covered.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.354
No, it's my fault.

21:12.437 --> 21:15.274
Not sure how I'm gonna
come up with the money.

21:15.357 --> 21:18.986
Store didn't do as well as I expected,
but I'll figure it out.

21:19.069 --> 21:21.822
Are rare Pogs worth anything now
or is it like Beanie Babies?

21:21.905 --> 21:24.950
Stop, Tim. I got you.
That's what friends are for.

21:25.659 --> 21:26.493
Thanks, Perc.

21:26.576 --> 21:30.372
Sorry, I've been so off my game
the past few weeks.

21:30.455 --> 21:34.501
I feel like I missed my window with Eliza
whether it was open or not.

21:34.584 --> 21:37.546
It's frustrating
'cause I've liked her for so long.

21:37.629 --> 21:39.798
You need to forget about Eliza.

21:39.881 --> 21:42.884
-She is messing up your life.
-But she's great.

21:42.968 --> 21:45.178
You had so much fun with her today.

21:45.262 --> 21:46.221
She's fine at best.

21:46.305 --> 21:49.266
I was hanging with her because
she was down to mess with the twins

21:49.349 --> 21:51.560
when my boy wasn't there, as usual.

21:51.643 --> 21:53.729
We haven't kicked it much lately.

21:53.812 --> 21:54.646
We haven't.

21:54.730 --> 21:58.400
My parents are pissed too 'cause I haven't
visited enough since I took over.

21:58.483 --> 21:59.443
Yeah.

21:59.526 --> 22:01.194
I have a pretty full life.

22:02.279 --> 22:03.739
I don't need Eliza.

22:03.822 --> 22:06.742
What you need is a drink,
and another after that.

22:06.825 --> 22:09.619
-Sounds like a night I wanna have.
-Give it up.

22:10.370 --> 22:13.749
I wish my parents were alive enough
to be pissed at me.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.751
They were always pissed at you.

22:15.834 --> 22:19.880
One more rapid-fire question.
What film was your queer awakening?

22:19.963 --> 22:22.257
-Ooh. Rufio in <i>Hook</i> for sure.
-Really?

22:22.341 --> 22:25.052
Oh, yeah.
Young me wanted to bangarang him.

22:25.135 --> 22:27.095
-You?
-Hands down, <i>Addams Family.</i>

22:27.179 --> 22:29.556
-Anjelica Huston and Raul Julia?
-Yeah.

22:29.639 --> 22:32.351
I only blinked during Pugsley scenes.
And <i>Y Tu Mamá También.</i>

22:32.434 --> 22:33.852
It's straight for 90 minutes.

22:33.935 --> 22:35.812
-Until it's not! Yeah.
-Until it's not!

22:38.023 --> 22:41.735
I can't wait to get this costume off.
Thank God Halloween is only once a year.

22:41.818 --> 22:44.237
-It doesn't have to be.
-Hmm?

22:44.321 --> 22:46.406
I'm part of a group
of like-minded individuals

22:46.490 --> 22:49.910
who think that Halloween
can and should be year-round.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.544
Hey, I thought we were gonna have a drink.

22:59.628 --> 23:02.547
Just getting the mail.
Twins superglued this shut.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.883
No. You don't gotta do that right now.

23:04.966 --> 23:07.552
Let's go to the bar
before Mitch starts to reuse glasses.

23:12.516 --> 23:14.518
An eviction notice?

23:15.227 --> 23:16.186
What gives, man?

23:16.269 --> 23:19.356
I wasn't supposed to be with you
when you found that.

23:19.439 --> 23:22.401
I'm sorry corporate's
not giving you money anymore,

23:22.484 --> 23:26.071
but the rent, Tim, the rent.
I felt real bad about it.

23:26.154 --> 23:28.907
-That's why I drew a sad face.
-I don't get it.

23:28.990 --> 23:30.700
After I rehired Kayla for you

23:30.784 --> 23:33.286
and you were so cool
with the damage to Carol's store?

23:33.370 --> 23:34.413
I paid for Kayla.

23:34.496 --> 23:35.914
Insurance paid for the damages.

23:35.997 --> 23:38.917
But I use your rent money
to pay for my insurance.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.004
I'm sorry, but you have until the end
of next month. Just business.

23:44.548 --> 23:47.509
So... still wanna have that drink?

23:54.015 --> 23:55.142
Just business.
