Previously on</i>The Secret Life
of the American Teenager...

00:02.102 --> 00:04.638
Ricky, what you're really
looking for--

00:04.705 --> 00:07.040
me to tell you that your mom
has to get out of your apartment

00:07.107 --> 00:10.544
because her living there
is not the best thing
for you and your son.

00:10.611 --> 00:13.046
Amy? My name's Nora.

00:13.113 --> 00:14.047
Do you mind
if I meet John?

00:14.114 --> 00:17.484
I really wanna meet John.

00:17.551 --> 00:20.053
Hi, Ashley.
There is a law
against not going to school.

00:20.120 --> 00:24.424
She's doing homeschooling.
Your books are in the box
along with a plan schedule.

00:24.491 --> 00:26.059
And we'll see you
at the end of the week.

00:26.126 --> 00:27.561
Are you saying
you wanna get married?

00:27.628 --> 00:29.029
No, I'm not saying
I wanna get married.

00:29.096 --> 00:32.633
I'm saying I'm not living
with you unless we're married.

00:32.699 --> 00:35.035
Ben, do not get any ideas.

00:35.102 --> 00:37.771
Evidently, I have to
find a place to live.

00:37.838 --> 00:39.239
I told you I didn't want
anything to threaten

00:39.306 --> 00:40.707
my custody agreement with Amy.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.110
Which is why I made friends
with Amy. She likes me.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.945
I need to find someplace
for Nora to live.

00:45.012 --> 00:46.013
And?

00:46.079 --> 00:47.047
You don't think
it would be possible

00:47.114 --> 00:49.449
for her to live here, do you?

00:49.516 --> 00:51.218
We are having a baby,

00:51.285 --> 00:54.855
and I wanna be married
to the baby's mother
before the baby gets here.

00:54.922 --> 00:55.055
Wait till next year.

00:55.122 --> 00:57.591
Just let me get married.

01:01.962 --> 01:03.597
It's Saturday.
You have to go.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.365
We agreed you would go,
and you're going.

01:05.432 --> 01:06.967
It's a nice place.
They're nice people,

01:07.034 --> 01:09.803
and it's really nice of them
to do this for you.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.038
I don't need parents.

01:11.104 --> 01:14.007
I didn't either,
but I got them anyway.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.009
Oh, you needed parents.
You never had parents.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.312
I had parents--
perfectly good parents--

01:18.378 --> 01:20.147
who, by the way,

01:20.214 --> 01:22.049
told me to stay away
from your father.

01:22.115 --> 01:24.051
Or are we calling him Bob
now that we're calling me Nora?
That's nice.

01:24.117 --> 01:26.720
I'm not calling him anything.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.589
You don't have any contact
with him, do you?

01:28.655 --> 01:30.891
Oh, hell, no.
Are you kidding?

01:30.958 --> 01:32.826
I want him to stay
locked up for life.

01:33.994 --> 01:37.097
Really, Ricky,
this is awfully sweet of you

01:37.164 --> 01:39.900
to try and force me
to live with supervision,

01:39.967 --> 01:43.036
but I'm just gonna, you know,
get my own apartment, okay?

01:43.103 --> 01:46.540
[chuckles]
Do you have any money
to get your own apartment?

01:46.607 --> 01:48.709
I have a job.
I'll get paid.

01:48.775 --> 01:49.042
You don't have a car.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.178
I'll get a car.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.180
With what?

01:53.247 --> 01:56.116
With the money
I get paid from my job.

01:56.183 --> 01:58.185
[chuckles]
You don't make enough money
from your job

01:58.252 --> 02:01.021
to pay rent and buy a car
and insurance.

02:01.088 --> 02:02.256
Do you have to
have insurance?

02:02.322 --> 02:05.859
Of course you have to
have insurance and a license.

02:05.926 --> 02:07.194
Do you even have a license?

02:07.261 --> 02:08.862
No.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.030
You drove my car
without a license?

02:10.097 --> 02:12.065
Well, I was going
to jail anyway.

02:12.132 --> 02:16.670
Okay, look,
you can't drive my car again
until you have a license,

02:16.737 --> 02:20.040
and you can't drive
your own car until you have
a license and insurance.

02:20.107 --> 02:22.042
And all that stuff--
the apartment and the car
and the insurance--

02:22.109 --> 02:25.112
All that costs a lot of money.

02:25.179 --> 02:28.048
And while you're earning money
and saving up
for all that stuff,

02:28.115 --> 02:30.717
you can't stay here.

02:30.784 --> 02:33.820
I'm not giving you back
the money you gave to me, okay?

02:33.887 --> 02:35.923
I paid back Ben
some money I owed him out of it,

02:35.989 --> 02:38.926
and every single dime left
went into an account
that pays interest.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.861
That money stays in the bank.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.696
What if I just stay here
for one month

02:42.763 --> 02:44.965
or maybe two or three or--

02:45.032 --> 02:46.967
No. And you know why
you can't.

02:47.034 --> 02:49.169
Why can't you stay with Amy
when you wanna go see John?

02:49.236 --> 02:51.405
No. Our agreement is
I get him weekends.

02:51.471 --> 02:53.407
But you're still here.

02:53.473 --> 02:56.276
Next weekend,
I pick him up on Friday night
and bring him over here,

02:56.343 --> 02:58.278
and Amy picks him up
on Sunday night.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.514
And no one else can be here.
Not even you.

03:00.581 --> 03:01.982
You mean especially me,
don't you?

03:02.049 --> 03:03.717
[knocking]

03:03.784 --> 03:05.118
Oh...
[sighs]

03:05.185 --> 03:07.221
God, I haven't even showered.
I--

03:07.287 --> 03:09.857
Well, I woke you up
in time to take a shower

03:09.923 --> 03:11.592
and get dressed
and get your things ready.

03:11.658 --> 03:13.060
So, sorry.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.795
[scoffs]

03:17.698 --> 03:19.766
Hi, sweetheart.
Hi, sweetheart.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.569
She's having some breakfast.
She just got up. Come on in.

03:22.636 --> 03:25.005
Okay.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.980
Hi, Nora.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.215
Good to see you.

03:35.282 --> 03:38.886
Uh, Ricky's been telling me
how well you're doing,

03:38.952 --> 03:41.188
and I was so glad to hear it.

03:41.255 --> 03:44.024
And, my, how lovely it is
to see you again, Margaret.
How you been?

03:44.091 --> 03:46.026
I'm fine. I'm just fine.

03:46.093 --> 03:49.029
You know, we stopped taking
in foster children,

03:49.096 --> 03:53.634
so it's been very peaceful
and quiet around our house.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.903
And I'd love
to keep it that way,

03:55.969 --> 03:57.905
even when
you're living with us.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.339
I'll get you some coffee.

03:59.406 --> 04:00.040
That's okay.
I'm all right.

04:00.107 --> 04:02.042
And, uh, we've got things
to do today.

04:02.109 --> 04:05.012
Not even time for coffee?

04:05.078 --> 04:07.381
My, aren't you a busy
career woman?

04:07.447 --> 04:09.716
What are you, uh,
planning on, uh,

04:09.783 --> 04:12.052
dragging me off to church
to wash my sins off

04:12.119 --> 04:13.687
before I step into your house?

04:13.754 --> 04:15.889
Got any plans like that?
Any surprises?

04:15.956 --> 04:18.458
Well, you might be surprised
to know I don't go to church.

04:18.525 --> 04:20.827
I'm a Buddhist,
and so is my husband, Shakur.

04:20.894 --> 04:23.864
Oh, good Lord.
My son was living with nudists.

04:25.332 --> 04:26.466
Buddhist.

04:26.533 --> 04:27.901
Gotcha.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.137
[chuckles]
Yes, you did.

04:30.204 --> 04:32.039
Are we gonna be
lighting candles

04:32.105 --> 04:34.041
and incense
and anything like that?

04:34.107 --> 04:36.810
'Cause I've got allergies,
you know.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.446
I didn't know
you have allergies.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.849
That's a surprise,
because you seem to have

04:41.915 --> 04:43.717
the immune system
of a horse.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.387
An insult like that
would just be considered

04:47.454 --> 04:49.957
a come-on in the big house,
sister.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.025
You heard what that woman
said to me, Ricky?

04:52.092 --> 04:53.927
I can't live with
this nudist Buddhist.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.062
Hey, I wasn't looking

04:55.128 --> 04:58.065
for an adult to raise,
believe me,

04:58.131 --> 05:00.033
but your son asked us
if we would take you in,

05:00.100 --> 05:02.035
and, well, yes,
we will take you in

05:02.102 --> 05:04.037
as long as you abide
by the rules,

05:04.104 --> 05:07.508
which I hope Ricky's
already told you about.

05:07.574 --> 05:09.209
I didn't. No.

05:09.276 --> 05:11.278
Oh, let me guess.
No boys in my room?

05:11.345 --> 05:13.680
Girls either.

05:13.747 --> 05:16.016
What does that mean?

05:16.083 --> 05:18.018
Uh, n-nothing.

05:18.085 --> 05:22.089
I was just saying
no company in the, uh, bedroom.

05:22.155 --> 05:25.592
Anyone who comes to visit
has to visit all of us

05:25.659 --> 05:29.062
in the, um, kitchen
or the living room.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.265
Yeah, that's probably
the easy one.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.234
No drinking, no drugs.
That might be slightly harder.

05:34.301 --> 05:36.036
And you do your own laundry
and clean up after yourself

05:36.103 --> 05:39.273
and help with the cooking
and cleaning up

05:39.339 --> 05:40.974
and help with any other work
around the house

05:41.041 --> 05:43.844
that she and Dad
might need done.

05:43.911 --> 05:47.147
All right.
I have to go downstairs.
I'll let you two chat.

05:47.214 --> 05:48.448
[chuckles]

05:48.515 --> 05:50.350
And I'll see you tonight.

05:50.417 --> 05:53.420
I thought Amy and I might--
might drop by with John

05:53.487 --> 05:55.722
just for a few minutes,
if you wanna meet him.

05:58.325 --> 06:02.629
I thought you'd be excited
about that, but I guess not.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.632
See you.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.170
[door opens, closes]

06:10.237 --> 06:11.038
How did you know
about the girlfriend?

06:11.104 --> 06:13.540
I hear things.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.148
<i>♪ Falling in love ♪</i>

06:21.215 --> 06:24.518
<i>♪ Is such an easy
thing to do ♪</i>

06:24.585 --> 06:27.054
<i>♪ Birds can do it
We can do it ♪</i>

06:27.120 --> 06:29.022
<i>♪ Let's stop talking
Let's get to it ♪</i>

06:29.089 --> 06:32.626
<i>♪ Let's fall in love ♪</i>

06:38.565 --> 06:40.501
We said we'd see her
every other weekend.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.870
I can't. I have to take John
over to Ricky's tonight.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.172
His mom is moving in
with his mom.

06:45.239 --> 06:46.840
She's never me John.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.709
Ricky thought it might
make her feel better

06:48.775 --> 06:51.111
since he's kicking her
out of the apartment today.

06:51.178 --> 06:53.847
Who cares
What about our mom?oms?

06:53.914 --> 06:57.251
What about my biology project?
That's why you wanna
go see Mom today?

06:57.317 --> 06:59.253
So she can do
your biology project?

06:59.319 --> 07:01.421
[scoffs]
Look, Ashley,

07:01.488 --> 07:03.090
if you're gonna do school
by yourself at home,

07:03.156 --> 07:05.225
then you're gonna have to do
school homework
by yourself at home.

07:05.292 --> 07:07.427
You're really bad at lectures.

07:07.494 --> 07:09.530
But John's, what, 18 months?

07:09.596 --> 07:11.298
So I guess you'll have to
work yourself up to that.

07:11.365 --> 07:14.001
Yeah. I guess.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.270
My point is,
I can't drive you today.

07:16.336 --> 07:19.039
I thought your point was
my own homework.d to do

07:19.106 --> 07:20.974
Jeez, Amy, focus.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.477
Everyone is supposed
Is that focused enough for you?

07:23.544 --> 07:25.812
Yeah, everyone is supposed
to do their own homework,

07:25.879 --> 07:27.481
but they don't.

07:27.548 --> 07:31.118
And there's no answer
for this one.r's guide

07:31.185 --> 07:33.587
It's a project.
A creative project.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.589
So I thought our mother
might be able

07:35.656 --> 07:37.524
to help point me
in the right direction,

07:37.591 --> 07:38.892
if we went up there, and--

07:38.959 --> 07:41.929
And pretended like we miss her
and wanna see her,

07:41.995 --> 07:44.464
when all you really want
is for her to do
your biology project.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.967
I miss her!
Yes, I do, too, Ashley.

07:47.034 --> 07:49.102
That's why I will
drive you up there next weekend,

07:49.169 --> 07:52.973
and we can both have
the weekend with her to visit,
not do do your homework.

07:54.374 --> 07:55.976
What?

07:57.544 --> 08:00.147
Okay, okay.

08:00.214 --> 08:02.249
Maybe I can help you
do your biology project.

08:02.316 --> 08:05.853
But just this once.
Just to support what you want

08:05.919 --> 08:08.555
and to support
your homeschooling efforts.

08:08.622 --> 08:11.558
Remember, I'm not exactly
a biologist.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.827
Yeah, you're not exactly
a sister either.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.028
[sighs]

08:17.064 --> 08:20.000
Don't help her
with her biology project.
But I told her I would help.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.169
Well, don't.
everyone into helping her.

08:22.236 --> 08:24.505
If she gets tired
maybe she'll go back to school.

08:24.571 --> 08:27.040
Mom researched it
do better at home.ents

08:27.107 --> 08:29.409
Especially students like Ashley
who aren't all that social.

08:29.476 --> 08:32.980
Well, maybe you should help her
but not as social as you.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.515
Hmm. Teen pregnancy joke?

08:34.581 --> 08:36.350
A "teen wanting to have sex
after being pregnant" joke.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.318
Ah. Funny.

08:38.385 --> 08:40.220
Really, Dad, if Ashley
doesn't want any friends,

08:40.287 --> 08:41.889
how am I supposed to force
Ashley to make friends?

08:41.955 --> 08:43.824
I don't know, but maybe
you could figure it out

08:43.891 --> 08:46.827
if you stopped spending
about having sex with Ricky.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.396
And maybe you could
didn't spend every waking minute

08:49.463 --> 08:51.465
trying to keep me
from having sex with Ricky.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.867
We're going to have sex,
Dad, like it or not.

08:53.934 --> 08:56.770
It's just time.
He's done everything
I've asked him to do,

08:56.837 --> 08:58.772
and we're both very responsible.

08:58.839 --> 09:01.408
We're both emotionally
and physically prepared.

09:01.475 --> 09:04.545
So, if we wanna have sex,
we can have sex.
It's our decision.

09:04.611 --> 09:06.446
Is it gonna be tonight?
'Cause I need to get

09:06.513 --> 09:08.182
emotionally, physically
prepared if it's
gonna be tonight.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.983
It's probably not
going to be tonight.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.886
Tonight, Ricky and I
are introducing John
to his grandmother, Nora.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.054
And after that?

09:14.121 --> 09:16.356
And after that--
I don't know.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.926
Probably come back here
or go over to his apartment.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.894
But I'll be home by midnight.
Midnight?

09:20.961 --> 09:22.529
John's bedtime
is midnight now?

09:22.596 --> 09:24.631
If we go over to his apartment
and it's late,

09:24.698 --> 09:26.466
then I can put John
to bed at Ricky's,

09:26.533 --> 09:28.902
where he has a bed
and everything else he needs.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.637
And then he'll stay there,
and I'll come home.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.806
After having sex with Ricky.
'Cause if you're not gonna
have sex with Ricky,

09:32.873 --> 09:34.208
you come back here
and put John to bed here.

09:34.274 --> 09:37.344
Then we'll have sex here.
Ooh, I don't think so.

09:37.411 --> 09:39.646
I don't think
you'd be comfortable
doing that here.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.448
Fine. We'll do it there.

09:41.515 --> 09:42.850
It's so romantic.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.852
Go to your boyfriend's apartment
and have sex

09:44.918 --> 09:47.688
and get up and leave him
and your son and drive home
late at night.

09:47.754 --> 09:48.889
[sighs]

09:48.956 --> 09:50.557
This is ridiculous, Amy.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.159
I don't care if he passed
some stupid test.

09:52.226 --> 09:54.628
I do not want you
having sex with him. Again.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.964
Wait until
you're out of high school
and living on your own,

09:57.030 --> 09:59.433
in your own place,
in your own bed,
and not one that I paid for.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.101
And then maybe--
maybe it'll be okay.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.769
What happened
to that stupid book

10:02.836 --> 10:05.239
that gave you tips
on how to talk to
your teenage daughter about sex?

10:05.305 --> 10:06.974
I threw it out.
I'm gonna write my own book.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.609
You see, Dad,

10:08.675 --> 10:10.511
the thing about
writing your own book

10:10.577 --> 10:13.146
is you have to be successful
at the thing
that you're writing about

10:13.213 --> 10:16.183
in order for it to sell.
[sighs]

10:16.250 --> 10:18.418
I don't think
you're successful at parenting.

10:18.485 --> 10:21.421
Just look at me.
Or no. Look at Ashley.

10:25.959 --> 10:29.062
And I'm sick of my whole life
keep having babies.e people

10:29.129 --> 10:32.966
Okay, well, it's good to know.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.002
It's good to let your feelings
out like that.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.004
It's healthy.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.839
And you should feel free
to be honest

10:38.906 --> 10:40.941
and express your anger
and resentment toward me

10:41.008 --> 10:43.110
for having a baby.

10:43.177 --> 10:45.145
But I do love Robie.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.047
And I know that you love Robie.

10:47.114 --> 10:49.816
And even if there were no Robie,
there would still be no
me and your dad

10:49.883 --> 10:52.819
living in the same house
with you and Amy...and John.

10:54.721 --> 10:56.323
Look, Ashley,
I'm sorry that Amy

10:56.390 --> 10:58.091
couldn't bring you up here
this weekend

10:58.158 --> 11:00.527
so we could have this
conversation face-to-face.

11:00.594 --> 11:02.763
But we can
talk about it some more
when we see each other.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.065
We're not gonna have time
to talk like this
when we see each other

11:05.132 --> 11:07.901
because I have
a big biology project
that I have to do next week,

11:07.968 --> 11:10.671
and I haven't even
gotten started on it.

11:10.737 --> 11:12.906
So it's probably
gonna ruin our weekend.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.041
Is it something
I can help you with?

11:14.107 --> 11:15.676
No, that's okay.

11:15.742 --> 11:18.779
I'm supposed to do it myself.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.348
Except I can't think
of anything myself.

11:21.415 --> 11:23.383
And I just thought
if you were here,
you might help me.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.118
But since you're not here,
I just got angry.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.421
So is that why you wanna
come up here this weekend--

11:27.487 --> 11:29.723
to get me to help you
with your biology project?

11:29.790 --> 11:31.091
Well, kind of. Yeah.

11:31.158 --> 11:34.828
You know what, Ashley?
I love when
you're honest with me,

11:34.895 --> 11:36.964
no matter how painful
it is to hear

11:37.030 --> 11:38.899
what you're saying
sometimes.

11:38.966 --> 11:42.002
We're gonna be fine.
We're all gonna be fine.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.406
Why don't you tell me what area
of biology you're studying,

11:46.473 --> 11:48.408
and let's see if we can't
come up with something.

11:48.475 --> 11:49.943
Ecosystems.

11:50.010 --> 11:50.978
Interesting.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.946
Not to me. Not really.

11:53.013 --> 11:56.517
Well, let's think about that--
about ecosystems.

11:56.583 --> 12:00.354
An ecosystem
is all the organisms
living in a particular area,

12:00.420 --> 12:02.856
including all
the nonliving things
that they interact with,

12:02.923 --> 12:06.026
<i>like air, water, soil,</i>

12:06.093 --> 12:07.928
sunlight.

12:07.995 --> 12:11.431
What does that mean to you?
I'm sorry. You lost me
at organisms.

12:12.466 --> 12:14.234
Okay, looks like
I'll be going.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.503
See you later, traitor.
And good-bye to Ben.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.405
Where is Ben?
Gotta say good-bye to Benny.

12:18.472 --> 12:20.674
Here I am. Hi, Nora.
I heard you're leaving,

12:20.741 --> 12:22.309
but we'll see you here
Monday through Friday?

12:22.376 --> 12:24.778
Well, if I can master
public transportation.

12:24.845 --> 12:27.247
I'll pick you up.
I don't know if I
want you to pick me up.

12:28.682 --> 12:31.018
Hi. Uh...

12:31.084 --> 12:33.754
Ah, I know you're Ricky's--
Ricky's what?

12:33.820 --> 12:35.389
Yeah, Ricky's what?

12:35.455 --> 12:37.791
Margaret.
Just call me Margaret.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.828
I'm his mother.
Margaret's his other mother.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.197
Nice going.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.865
It's good
to see you again, Ben.

12:44.932 --> 12:47.634
The last time I saw you,
I was pretty much
in a state of shock.

12:47.701 --> 12:50.003
So I apologize
for forgetting your name

12:50.070 --> 12:52.973
and for causing anyone
any awkwardness here.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.908
Let's see.
When was that?

12:54.975 --> 12:56.877
When she talked Adrian
into have the baby?

12:56.944 --> 13:00.514
Whoa. A whole family
of traitors, huh?

13:00.581 --> 13:03.617
I work at the clinic.
I was there.

13:03.684 --> 13:05.853
And Adrian made her own
decision.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.488
And I don't think this is
the place to talk about it,

13:08.555 --> 13:11.358
but we can talk
about this some other time.

13:11.425 --> 13:13.894
Like a butcher shop
isn't the perfect place
to talk about--

13:13.961 --> 13:16.630
Mom! Nora.

13:18.432 --> 13:19.933
All right.
Um, since I'm the one

13:20.000 --> 13:22.870
who got us all entangled
in this weirdness,

13:22.936 --> 13:26.206
maybe I could unravel it
with a bit of good news.

13:27.841 --> 13:29.476
I'm thinking
about getting married.

13:29.543 --> 13:32.312
Yeah, you keep
thinking about it.
That's old news.

13:32.379 --> 13:35.816
You're gonna marry
his old girlfriend?

13:35.883 --> 13:37.818
I don't call her
"his old girlfriend".

13:37.885 --> 13:39.253
I call her Adrian.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.021
She's had a friendship ring
for months.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.856
They're friends.
They're not getting married.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.858
We are if she says yes.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.460
Well, good for you.

13:46.527 --> 13:50.364
I might be getting married
myself one day...

13:50.430 --> 13:53.066
if she says yes.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.869
Oh, like you weren't
gonna tell him.

13:57.371 --> 13:58.939
Bye, guys.

13:59.006 --> 14:00.974
[sighs]

14:01.842 --> 14:05.012
"If she says yes"?

14:05.078 --> 14:06.713
What?

14:08.282 --> 14:11.385
Your mother's a lesbian?

14:21.595 --> 14:23.430
You know,
I just don't get it--

14:23.497 --> 14:26.233
Grace and that Grant guy.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.235
Be honest with me, Tom.

14:28.302 --> 14:30.304
Between me and Grant,
who do you think--
Grant.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.806
You didn't let me finish.
Okay, finish.

14:32.873 --> 14:34.174
What I was going to say is,

14:34.241 --> 14:36.276
between me and Grant,
who do you think is better

14:36.343 --> 14:38.111
for your sister's future?
Grant.

14:38.178 --> 14:41.448
Her future, Tom.
Your sister's entire future.

14:41.515 --> 14:42.449
Think about it.

14:42.516 --> 14:45.118
Her entire future.
Grant.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.020
I don't believe this.
How can you say that?

14:47.087 --> 14:48.822
Do you want me
to say it again?

14:48.889 --> 14:50.524
No, I don't want you
to say it again.

14:50.591 --> 14:53.160
I just don't get how you can
like that Grant guy better
than me.

14:53.227 --> 14:55.529
He didn't have sex
with my sister.

14:55.596 --> 14:56.930
You did.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.098
Yeah. Like he's
not going to?

14:58.165 --> 15:00.234
When he does,
I'll reconsider.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.469
Thanks a lot. You know,
after all I did for you.

15:02.536 --> 15:04.404
Did you forget
that I moved in here for you?

15:04.471 --> 15:07.441
No. You moved in here
for you.

15:07.508 --> 15:10.143
I took you in.

15:10.210 --> 15:11.545
You know what your problem is?

15:11.612 --> 15:13.347
You have to move on.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.315
I did move on.
I moved on to Madison.

15:15.382 --> 15:16.316
She dumped you.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.151
No, her father broke us up.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.721
She didn't put up
much of a fight.

15:20.787 --> 15:23.824
You know what?
You're not exactly doing much
for my self-esteem here, buddy.

15:23.891 --> 15:25.926
You want self-esteem,
get a book.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.928
All right.
I'll tell you one thing, though.

15:27.995 --> 15:30.731
If he tells Grace he loves her,
look out. That's trouble.

15:30.797 --> 15:33.200
Is that what you did?

15:35.169 --> 15:37.771
You know, Grant told me
that he loves me.

15:37.838 --> 15:39.540
And you believe that?

15:39.606 --> 15:41.175
Do you believe that?

15:41.241 --> 15:43.210
I don't know.
I think he could love you.

15:43.277 --> 15:45.145
But it doesn't really matter
what I think.

15:45.212 --> 15:46.680
What do you think?

15:46.747 --> 15:48.615
No, really, Grace,
what do you think?

15:48.682 --> 15:51.552
Can you trust him?
Should I trust him?

15:51.618 --> 15:54.221
I feel stupid trusting him,
because I just found out

15:54.288 --> 15:58.025
that someone else I trusted
was totally lying and hiding
things from me.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.928
But I don't know.

16:01.929 --> 16:04.298
I think I do trust Grant.

16:04.364 --> 16:07.000
And that's okay.
It's okay to trust him.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.770
He seems like
a really nice guy.

16:09.837 --> 16:12.239
And he's right out there
with his feelings, you know.

16:12.306 --> 16:15.309
He says what he's thinking.
Yeah, he does.

16:15.375 --> 16:18.378
I-- I really think
that he does love me,

16:18.445 --> 16:21.215
and I really think
that I love him.

16:21.281 --> 16:24.218
I think that we'd love
each other even if we
didn't have sex,

16:24.284 --> 16:27.020
so I don't know whether
we should have sex or not.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.823
It's so confusing.
Like, we wanna have sex,

16:29.890 --> 16:32.025
but I think we'd be fine
if we didn't have sex, you know?

16:32.092 --> 16:33.861
Yeah, I know the feeling.

16:33.927 --> 16:37.197
What feeling?
You're in love with Ben?

16:39.666 --> 16:41.502
I love him.

16:41.568 --> 16:44.137
I don't know if
I'm in love with him.

16:44.204 --> 16:46.039
But I love him.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.008
With the difference being?

16:48.075 --> 16:51.178
What I feel for Ben is--
is a mature love.

16:51.245 --> 16:53.113
It's not like
what I had with Ricky.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.015
You know, with Ricky,

16:55.082 --> 16:57.417
we couldn't keep our hands
off of each other.

16:57.484 --> 17:00.087
You know, we wanted to jump
into bed with each other

17:00.153 --> 17:02.055
whenever we got the chance.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.057
It wasn't real love.

17:04.124 --> 17:08.128
It was just infatuation.

17:08.195 --> 17:11.131
Yeah, I think that's what
they call it-- infatuation.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.066
Just infatuation?

17:13.133 --> 17:15.068
Yeah.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.037
But, you know,
I really love Ben,

17:17.104 --> 17:19.039
and I know he loves me.

17:19.106 --> 17:22.409
He's the kind of guy
that I've always wanted.

17:22.476 --> 17:25.679
He's there.
My dad was never there.

17:25.746 --> 17:29.383
My mom was never there.
He's there.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.219
What?

17:32.286 --> 17:34.555
Is being there enough?

17:34.621 --> 17:36.123
Being there is everything.

17:37.758 --> 17:39.760
Okay, what is that look?

17:39.826 --> 17:42.429
Nothing.
I don't like that look.

17:42.496 --> 17:45.199
I just don't like that you
think about marrying somebody

17:45.265 --> 17:46.767
just because
they're gonna be there,

17:46.834 --> 17:49.369
but someone you have no strong
physical attraction to.

17:49.436 --> 17:52.306
I mean, maybe being there
is everything a child needs, 

17:52.372 --> 17:54.675
but I don't know if it's
everything a woman needs.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.777
It's different
when you're pregnant, Grace.

17:56.844 --> 17:58.478
The whole world is different.

17:58.545 --> 18:01.949
I can't just think about myself.
I have to think about the baby.

18:02.015 --> 18:04.852
And, you know,
when I think about the baby,

18:04.918 --> 18:06.920
I know she loves Ben,

18:06.987 --> 18:10.057
because Ben is her daddy,
and he's good to us.

18:10.123 --> 18:13.627
And it just--
it just makes me love him.

18:13.694 --> 18:16.230
You're not gonna have sex
with Ben, though, are you?

18:16.296 --> 18:18.432
I mean, I can if I want.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.766
Do you want?

18:19.833 --> 18:21.134
I might.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.670
I make my decisions
differently now.

18:23.737 --> 18:27.407
I see. So, whether or not
you're attracted to somebody
is a decision?

18:27.474 --> 18:29.409
Or whether or not I act

18:29.476 --> 18:32.012
on being attracted to someone
is a decision.

18:32.079 --> 18:35.148
And right now,
Ben and I are choosing

18:35.215 --> 18:37.150
not to act
on whatever attraction

18:37.217 --> 18:39.386
we have towards each other.

18:39.453 --> 18:41.221
Okay, you know what?
Back to you.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.990
Are you gonna have sex
with Grant or not?

18:43.056 --> 18:44.558
I don't know.
I don't know.

18:44.625 --> 18:46.560
All right. Well, don't wait
until you're in the car

18:46.627 --> 18:48.228
making out with
the guy to decide, all right?

18:48.295 --> 18:49.863
All right.

18:49.930 --> 18:52.933
And if you have any doubts,
don't do it.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.402
And if you have any doubts,
just don't do it.

18:55.469 --> 18:57.004
Don't do anything.

18:57.070 --> 18:59.773
And what does that mean?
You know what that means.

18:59.840 --> 19:02.009
Don't get married to Ben
just because you're pregnant

19:02.075 --> 19:04.978
and you like all the nice things
he does for you and the baby.

19:05.045 --> 19:07.347
You have to really love him
to marry him, Adrian.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.716
If you don't,
it's just not fair.

19:09.783 --> 19:11.318
Well, he hasn't asked me.

19:11.385 --> 19:15.088
And he may never ask me,
so I don't have to decide that,
do I?

19:16.723 --> 19:20.060
I don't know why
we keep getting up at the crack
of dawn to go to the club.

19:20.127 --> 19:21.762
I mean,
it's too early to drink,

19:21.828 --> 19:23.564
and there's really
no other reason,

19:23.630 --> 19:25.199
because we're not
playing golf.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.434
We're playing something,
but it's not golf.

19:27.501 --> 19:29.736
And by that you mean?

19:29.803 --> 19:31.305
You stink.

19:31.371 --> 19:34.308
I only stink
when I'm playing with you.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.476
Honestly, every time we go out,
I keep thinking

19:36.543 --> 19:38.478
you're gonna give me
some big news of some sort.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.881
Of some sort?
Yeah.

19:40.948 --> 19:44.151
Like, uh,

19:44.218 --> 19:46.186
Ben's gonna ask Adrian
to marry him?

19:46.253 --> 19:49.656
Yeah, like Ben's gonna
ask Adrian to marry him.

19:49.723 --> 19:51.692
Ben's gonna ask Adrian
to marry him?

19:51.758 --> 19:54.828
I think so, Ruben. Yeah.
What do you think?

19:54.895 --> 19:56.396
What do I think?

19:56.463 --> 19:58.565
I think that's the best news
I ever heard.

19:58.632 --> 20:01.235
Leo, are you kidding me?
Is he really gonna ask her?

20:01.301 --> 20:03.237
Not before he asks you
and Adrian's mother.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.239
He's gotta ask both of you,
and then he can ask Adrian.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.106
Did he ask you?

20:06.173 --> 20:08.008
Yeah. I would like them
to get married.

20:08.075 --> 20:10.377
But here's where you and I
have to agree to disagree.

20:10.444 --> 20:13.213
I don't think they need
to get married till a year
after the baby's here.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.215
I don't think
they need to rush out

20:15.282 --> 20:17.651
and get married
before the baby comes.

20:17.718 --> 20:19.853
That's because you're
the father of the father

20:19.920 --> 20:21.421
and not the father
of the mother.

20:21.488 --> 20:23.657
I want them to get married
before the baby comes.

20:23.724 --> 20:26.093
You know I want them
to get married
before the baby comes.

20:26.159 --> 20:28.262
It's too easy not to
after the baby comes.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.897
I want a commitment.

20:29.963 --> 20:31.365
You want a commitment.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.100
Don't you think Adrian
should want a commitment?

20:33.166 --> 20:34.868
I'm sure Adrian
wants a commitment.

20:34.935 --> 20:37.171
Are you?
'Cause I don't want Ben to ask

20:37.237 --> 20:40.107
if you think there's
a chance she might say no.

20:40.174 --> 20:42.509
I mean, that could set off
a whole world of problems.

20:42.576 --> 20:46.213
That could pull
everybody apart

20:46.280 --> 20:48.682
rather than
bring everybody together--
if she says no.

20:48.749 --> 20:50.050
She's not gonna say no.

20:50.117 --> 20:52.719
Talk to her.
You and Cindy talk to her.

20:52.786 --> 20:54.321
And if the two of you
have any doubt,

20:54.388 --> 20:57.157
even the slightest chance
that Adrian might say no,

20:57.224 --> 20:59.393
then you, or you and Cindy,
say no to Ben.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.028
Don't let him get
the no from Adrian.

21:01.094 --> 21:03.931
You and Cindy
make up some excuse.

21:03.997 --> 21:06.633
It's too early or whatever.
You two be the bad guys.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.936
And if we talk to her,
and she wants Ben to ask her,

21:09.002 --> 21:11.305
she wants to get married--
Then let Ben ask her.

21:11.371 --> 21:14.441
But let's you and I agree
that they set the date--
Ben and Adrian.

21:14.508 --> 21:18.111
We'll let them get married
whenever they wanna get married

21:18.178 --> 21:19.513
and however
they wanna get married.

21:19.580 --> 21:21.148
And if there's a wedding,

21:21.215 --> 21:23.116
it's whatever wedding
the two of them want,

21:23.183 --> 21:24.818
and again,
whenever they want it,

21:24.885 --> 21:27.588
even if they wanna wait
till after the baby comes.

21:28.789 --> 21:30.824
Or even if it's before
the baby comes.

21:32.292 --> 21:34.127
May the best man win.

21:36.763 --> 21:40.267
Are you supposed
to be on the phone at work?

21:40.334 --> 21:42.236
I'm off work. It's over.

21:42.302 --> 21:44.738
And I just want you
to tell my mother--

21:44.805 --> 21:46.106
Nora that--

21:46.173 --> 21:49.443
Ricky, this is ridiculous.
She's your mother.

21:49.510 --> 21:52.145
You can call her "Mother"
or "Mom."

21:52.212 --> 21:53.380
No, that's not fair to you.

21:53.447 --> 21:56.016
I know how you feel about me
no matter what you call me,

21:56.083 --> 21:59.987
and I know
that you call Nora "Mom"
when you're with her

22:00.053 --> 22:01.522
or when you're talking to her.

22:01.588 --> 22:04.024
So? Just go with it.

22:04.091 --> 22:05.859
She is your mother.

22:05.926 --> 22:07.861
That's the truth.

22:07.928 --> 22:10.397
So let's just deal
with the truth, okay?

22:10.464 --> 22:12.900
All right.
Well, the truth is,

22:12.966 --> 22:15.102
I don't really wanna bring
John by there tonight

22:15.169 --> 22:18.405
to see my mother
who gave birth to me
but was never my mother.

22:18.472 --> 22:20.908
You changed your mind?
Why is that?

22:20.974 --> 22:23.110
It was just a bad idea
in the first place.

22:23.177 --> 22:24.678
It's too soon.

22:24.745 --> 22:26.747
I think I should just
let her get settled in first.

22:26.813 --> 22:30.184
You said you were coming by
with Amy and John,

22:30.250 --> 22:32.119
and she's counting on it,

22:32.186 --> 22:35.389
so you are coming by
with Amy and John.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.824
I said might.
We might come by.

22:37.891 --> 22:39.193
But we're not--
Or I'm not.

22:39.259 --> 22:40.394
Ricky.

22:40.460 --> 22:42.229
Amy can bring him by
if she wants.

22:42.296 --> 22:43.397
I know what this is about.

22:43.463 --> 22:44.431
I have to go.

22:44.498 --> 22:48.135
She is the daughter
of an alcoholic,

22:48.202 --> 22:52.239
and alcoholics
disappoint their children
over and over.

22:52.306 --> 22:56.176
I don't want you to do the same.

22:56.243 --> 23:00.080
You told her that you
were going to be here,
so be here.

23:02.115 --> 23:04.518
Remember, I'm the mother

23:04.585 --> 23:06.920
who tells you what to do,
and you do it.

23:06.987 --> 23:11.225
So you get Amy and John,

23:11.291 --> 23:13.827
and you come over tonight.

23:13.894 --> 23:16.129
And I will tell your mother

23:16.196 --> 23:19.533
that you will be here
around 7:00.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.469
See you then.

23:22.536 --> 23:25.172
Bye.
[beeps]

23:26.206 --> 23:27.574
[beeps]

23:39.219 --> 23:41.088
[phone ringing]

23:43.123 --> 23:44.424
[beeps]

23:44.491 --> 23:45.893
Hi.
Hi.

23:45.959 --> 23:48.095
What time are we going
over to your mother's house?

23:48.161 --> 23:50.564
Here's the thing.
I'm not feeling that well,

23:50.631 --> 23:53.901
so I don't think
I should be around John tonight
or anyone else.

23:53.967 --> 23:54.902
What's wrong?

23:54.968 --> 23:56.136
Oh, I don't know.

23:56.203 --> 23:58.305
It's probably the flu.
But whatever it is,

23:58.372 --> 24:00.140
I can't go tonight,
so we're not going.

24:00.207 --> 24:01.275
Oh, no. Really?

24:01.341 --> 24:03.877
I gotta go.
[beeps]

24:04.912 --> 24:06.847
[beeps]
[sighs]

24:06.914 --> 24:09.016
That's where I wanna go--
Poppie's Tacos.

24:09.082 --> 24:10.651
No. Let's go someplace nice.

24:10.717 --> 24:12.486
No. I'm craving tacos.

24:12.553 --> 24:15.222
Then we'll go to that
Mexican fusion place downtown.

24:15.289 --> 24:16.657
Mexican fusion?
What is that?

24:16.723 --> 24:19.193
Mexican fused
with something else.

24:19.259 --> 24:20.761
I don't know.
Let's go find out.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.429
I mean, it got a great review.
It looks really nice.

24:22.496 --> 24:24.298
What's the fusion?
Mexican and what?

24:24.364 --> 24:26.600
I really don't know.
You want me to call them?
Get a menu?

24:26.667 --> 24:28.602
No. I don't like fusion.

24:28.669 --> 24:30.304
I don't want Mexican
and something else.

24:30.370 --> 24:32.539
I want Mexican.
Poppie's Tacos.

24:32.606 --> 24:34.308
I'm craving Poppie's Tacos
with hot sauce.

24:34.374 --> 24:36.143
Come on. You're just trying
to save me money.

24:36.210 --> 24:37.811
No, I'm not.
It's what I want.

24:37.878 --> 24:39.446
Really?
Really.

24:39.513 --> 24:43.016
All right.
Well, I'd take you
wherever you wanna go,

24:43.083 --> 24:46.220
but if that's what you want,
then that's what you shall have.

24:46.286 --> 24:47.855
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

24:47.921 --> 24:50.057
See you then.
[beeps]

24:50.123 --> 24:52.759
So you're not eating here?
No. We're going out.

24:52.826 --> 24:55.729
You know, Cindy,
we should go out, too.
Feel like going out to dinner?

24:55.796 --> 24:57.731
I'm cooking.
I'm cooking right now.

24:57.798 --> 25:00.100
Yeah, but you can stop
right where you are,

25:00.167 --> 25:01.935
put that stuff away,
and we'll go out.

25:02.002 --> 25:03.937
I don't wanna go out.

25:04.004 --> 25:07.140
And I'm sick of eating out.
I eat out every night
when I'm working.

25:07.207 --> 25:10.143
I thought that, well,
maybe we could stick around
the house tonight,

25:10.210 --> 25:12.312
eat in front of the TV,
watch a movie.

25:12.379 --> 25:14.615
Okay. If that's what you want,
we could do that.

25:16.016 --> 25:18.852
How's that sound, Adrian?

25:18.919 --> 25:21.922
You think you and Ben
might wanna stick around
the house, eat here?

25:22.990 --> 25:24.858
She just said she wants
Poppie's Tacos.

25:24.925 --> 25:27.127
Yeah, I do.

25:27.194 --> 25:29.997
And you know who loves
Poppie's Tacos more than I do?

25:30.063 --> 25:32.699
Ben. He loves tacos.

25:32.766 --> 25:34.935
That's his favorite place--
Poppie's.

25:35.002 --> 25:36.403
You really love Ben,
don't you?

25:36.470 --> 25:39.840
Where did that come from?
How do you jump from tacos
to real love?

25:39.907 --> 25:42.843
Because she's choosing
tacos for him,
not just for hisself.

25:42.910 --> 25:44.611
It's just tacos, okay?

25:44.678 --> 25:47.047
Do you love him, Adrian?

25:47.114 --> 25:50.117
Uh, I think so.

25:50.184 --> 25:52.052
Yeah, he's--
he's a nice guy.

25:52.119 --> 25:54.254
You think so,
or you know so?

25:55.656 --> 25:58.225
I know so.
If Ben were
to come here today

25:58.292 --> 26:00.294
and ask you to marry him,
would you marry him?

26:01.662 --> 26:03.964
He's not gonna ask me
to marry him.

26:04.031 --> 26:05.599
If we ever decide
to get married,

26:05.666 --> 26:08.302
it'll be a mutual decision
at some point in the future

26:08.368 --> 26:10.137
when we both know
we really love each other.

26:10.204 --> 26:12.639
You don't really
love each other right now?

26:12.706 --> 26:14.708
You seem like you really
love each other right now.

26:14.775 --> 26:18.345
I don't really know.
How does anyone know?

26:19.546 --> 26:21.748
Maybe.

26:21.815 --> 26:25.252
Oh, come on.
You know. You both know.

26:25.319 --> 26:28.522
You look really happy....
and in love

26:28.589 --> 26:32.092
Dad, promise me
you'd never push Ben

26:32.159 --> 26:34.094
into asking me to marry him.

26:34.161 --> 26:36.530
Because if you do that,
then I'll never really know

26:36.597 --> 26:39.099
how he feels about me, okay?

26:39.166 --> 26:42.135
It may look like he's
in love with me, but he
may not be in love with me.

26:42.202 --> 26:43.971
So promise.

26:44.037 --> 26:45.973
Okay, I promise.

26:46.039 --> 26:48.475
But if I were to bet on it,
I would bet that he loves you,

26:48.542 --> 26:50.811
and he wants to be
with you and the baby
the rest of his life.

26:50.878 --> 26:54.081
Which still doesn't mean
he wants to get married.

26:56.783 --> 26:59.086
I'm going to take a nap.

27:04.391 --> 27:07.461
Ow! What was that for?
What is going on?

27:07.528 --> 27:09.696
What do you mean,
what's going on?
We were just talking.

27:09.763 --> 27:12.699
Yeah. What did you
and Leo talk about
while you were playing golf?

27:12.766 --> 27:16.770
Nothing.
It was after we played golf.

27:16.837 --> 27:18.972
Ben wants to ask Adrian
to marry him.

27:19.039 --> 27:20.340
But he's gonna ask us first.

27:20.407 --> 27:23.010
You know how I feel about
Ben and Adrian getting married.

27:23.076 --> 27:25.279
He wants to meet us before
the two of them have dinner

27:25.345 --> 27:27.147
so he can ask us
if he can marry her.

27:27.214 --> 27:28.815
And then he's
gonna propose to her.

27:28.882 --> 27:30.617
So I really do think
he loves her.

27:30.684 --> 27:33.520
I know he does.
And she loves him.

27:33.587 --> 27:36.924
So, they're getting married.

27:36.990 --> 27:38.859
Our little Adrian's
getting married.

27:38.926 --> 27:41.195
And what if I say no?
Don't say no.

27:41.261 --> 27:43.597
If Adrian wants to get married,
then let her get married.

27:43.664 --> 27:45.866
And if she doesn't,
then let her say no.

27:45.933 --> 27:48.602
But she's not gonna
say no, Cindy.

27:48.669 --> 27:50.771
When? When does Ben
wanna get married?

27:50.838 --> 27:53.674
I don't know.
But Leo and I both agreed

27:53.740 --> 27:56.343
that Ben and Adrian
should make that decision.

27:56.410 --> 27:58.812
Of course,
I think it should happen
as soon as possible.

27:58.879 --> 28:02.115
If they're gonna get married,
don't you think it should happen
before the baby comes?

28:02.182 --> 28:04.017
No, I don't.
Why not?

28:04.084 --> 28:06.920
I don't think
she really wants to marry him.
I do.

28:08.088 --> 28:10.891
I just thought I'd call
and see how you are.

28:10.958 --> 28:12.659
Really?
That's why you're calling?

28:12.726 --> 28:14.127
That's why I'm calling.

28:14.194 --> 28:16.363
I'm fine.
How are you?

28:16.430 --> 28:18.265
Am I bothering you?

28:18.332 --> 28:20.234
You sound like you're angry
or something.

28:20.300 --> 28:23.103
I'm not angry, okay?
I'm not angry at all.

28:23.170 --> 28:25.472
Oh, well, is everything
okay with Amy?

28:25.539 --> 28:28.342
Everything is great with Amy.

28:28.408 --> 28:30.277
I'm just dealing with
some stuff with my mother.

28:30.344 --> 28:32.279
Ah, your mother's so nice.

28:32.346 --> 28:34.014
I'm never gonna forget
how kind she was to me.

28:34.081 --> 28:36.750
My other mother.
Oh.

28:36.817 --> 28:40.153
Yeah. You know, she spent
so many years doing drugs,

28:40.220 --> 28:41.522
she's like a kid.

28:41.588 --> 28:44.024
And, of course,
she married the wrong...person.

28:44.091 --> 28:46.026
Completely ruined her life.

28:46.093 --> 28:48.128
Yeah, that--
that can happen.

28:48.195 --> 28:49.796
Yeah, it can.

29:04.244 --> 29:05.946
[phone ringing]

29:09.883 --> 29:11.818
[beeps]
Hello?

29:11.885 --> 29:14.388
<i>[Nora]
Help. Help me.
Help me, please.</i>

29:14.454 --> 29:15.556
Who is this?

29:15.622 --> 29:16.890
It's Ricky's mother.

29:16.957 --> 29:19.326
Oh. Hi. Margaret?

29:19.393 --> 29:21.595
Not the other mother,
the mother.

29:21.662 --> 29:23.697
The one being held captive
by the other mother.

29:23.764 --> 29:25.465
You're so funny.

29:25.532 --> 29:27.734
Hi, Nora. I'm sorry we didn't
get to come over tonight.

29:27.801 --> 29:29.303
He's not sick, you know.

29:29.369 --> 29:30.938
Ricky? No, he is.
He has the flu.

29:31.004 --> 29:34.308
No, he doesn't.
He just doesn't want me
to meet John.

29:34.374 --> 29:36.210
No, really, Ricky wants you
to meet John.

29:36.276 --> 29:37.611
I know he does.
He told me he does.

29:37.678 --> 29:39.680
He's never sick. Never.

29:39.746 --> 29:42.316
Neither of us are ever sick.

29:42.382 --> 29:44.852
He just doesn't want me
to meet John,

29:44.918 --> 29:46.854
and I was really looking forward
to meeting John,

29:46.920 --> 29:48.689
and, well,
seeing you again, and--

29:48.755 --> 29:51.325
No, really, Ricky told me
he wanted you to meet John.

29:51.391 --> 29:52.759
I'm sure he wants you
to meet John.

29:55.162 --> 29:57.865
No, he doesn't.
He changed his mind.

29:57.931 --> 29:59.499
Gotta go.
Warden's here.
[beeps]

29:59.566 --> 30:04.171
Nora, I'm sorry.

30:04.238 --> 30:06.807
I am so sorry.

30:06.874 --> 30:08.509
I wasn't thinking.

30:08.575 --> 30:11.378
And I was really irritated
with you,

30:11.445 --> 30:12.980
and in a split second,
I snapped,

30:13.046 --> 30:15.315
and I made that remark
about girls,

30:15.382 --> 30:17.317
and I shouldn't have.

30:17.384 --> 30:18.886
But I thought he knew.

30:18.952 --> 30:21.088
I thought Ricky knew.

30:21.154 --> 30:22.489
No, he didn't,

30:22.556 --> 30:25.125
and now he does,
and now he hates me.

30:26.527 --> 30:28.428
Yeah.
[phone ringing]

30:30.831 --> 30:32.366
[beeps]
Hello?

30:32.432 --> 30:34.568
Hello? Margaret?
Yes?

30:34.635 --> 30:36.670
Hi. It's Amy.
How are you?

30:36.737 --> 30:39.473
Hi, Amy.

30:39.540 --> 30:42.476
I'm fine.
How are you?

30:42.543 --> 30:44.444
I think I'm okay.

30:44.511 --> 30:48.248
Is there something going on?
Something between
Nora and Ricky?

30:48.315 --> 30:49.917
Something I should know about?

30:49.983 --> 30:52.619
'Cause I feel really bad
about not bringing John
over there.

30:52.686 --> 30:55.189
We said we'd
bring him over there.
Should I bring him over there?

30:55.255 --> 30:59.259
Well, maybe that's a question
you need to ask Ricky.

30:59.326 --> 31:02.329
He's not answering his phone,
and he's not replying
to any text messages.

31:02.396 --> 31:05.866
Well, I've already done
too much talking today,

31:05.933 --> 31:09.236
but I will say that those two

31:09.303 --> 31:10.838
are in the process

31:10.904 --> 31:13.040
of getting to know each other.

31:13.106 --> 31:15.976
And it's gonna be difficult
if Ricky stays home

31:16.043 --> 31:19.980
and pretends to have the flu
instead of being over here.

31:20.047 --> 31:23.884
<i>But I think that Ricky
should be here</i>

31:23.951 --> 31:26.887
when Nora sees John
for the first time.

31:26.954 --> 31:29.756
I really do.

31:29.823 --> 31:32.226
I just want you to know
I'm really excited
for you, Ben.

31:32.292 --> 31:34.328
Yeah, well,
Ruben can say no.

31:34.394 --> 31:35.395
That's not gonna happen.

31:35.462 --> 31:36.697
Cindy could say no.

31:36.763 --> 31:38.465
Yeah, that could happen.

31:38.532 --> 31:41.268
It could, but I don't think
it's going to.

31:41.335 --> 31:44.104
And if I know you,
you know it's not going to.

31:44.171 --> 31:47.107
We really
wanna wish you well.

31:47.174 --> 31:49.543
And I really hope
that she says yes,

31:49.610 --> 31:52.112
And a year from now,
you're getting married

31:52.179 --> 31:55.182
in a small ceremony.

31:55.249 --> 31:59.419
You know, just family
in our wonderful home.

31:59.486 --> 32:01.655
He tell you to say that?

32:01.722 --> 32:03.357
Who?

32:03.423 --> 32:04.691
The big guy.
The Sausage King.

32:04.758 --> 32:06.126
No.

32:07.427 --> 32:09.930
That's what I think.

32:11.431 --> 32:13.300
You know, Ben,

32:13.367 --> 32:16.103
when people
really love each other,

32:16.170 --> 32:18.172
they lie for each other.

32:18.238 --> 32:20.974
And one day,
when you're married,

32:21.041 --> 32:24.378
you'll lie for Adrian,
and she'll lie for you.

32:24.444 --> 32:25.879
It's fun.

32:27.514 --> 32:28.715
I can't wait.

32:28.782 --> 32:29.850
No, you can.

32:29.917 --> 32:33.253
Dad, truthfully,
I don't wanna wait.

32:33.320 --> 32:34.922
I'd like to get married
as soon as possible.

32:34.988 --> 32:36.723
But I understand
your point of view.

32:36.790 --> 32:39.359
I really understand
that you'd like me to wait
until the baby's a year old.

32:39.426 --> 32:41.261
Does that mean you're gonna wait
till the baby's a year old?

32:41.328 --> 32:43.430
Probably not.
Wish me luck.

32:43.497 --> 32:45.766
[both]
Good luck.

32:48.135 --> 32:50.137
He's really growing up.

32:50.204 --> 32:53.240
Too fast, Betty.
He's growing up too fast.

32:53.307 --> 32:55.642
I know this isn't
what you wanted for him.

32:55.709 --> 32:58.011
You know, a baby at 17.

32:58.078 --> 33:00.347
No, it's not.

33:00.414 --> 33:02.649
It makes me feel like a--
like a failure.

33:02.716 --> 33:06.253
Oh, it really breaks my heart
that you feel that way.

33:06.320 --> 33:09.556
You're a really good father.
You really are.

33:09.623 --> 33:13.060
I-- I just feel as if
I should've done something

33:13.126 --> 33:15.062
that would've kept this
from happening, you know?

33:15.128 --> 33:16.463
He's too young
to be a father.

33:16.530 --> 33:18.999
He's too young
to get married, but--

33:19.066 --> 33:22.269
Yeah, but-- but he's
a nice young man,

33:22.336 --> 33:24.905
and he's kind,
and he's honest,

33:24.972 --> 33:27.774
and he's responsible,
and it's all because of you.

33:28.876 --> 33:30.711
Thanks, Betty.

33:30.777 --> 33:32.813
I really needed to hear that.

33:32.880 --> 33:35.449
[chuckles]

33:43.290 --> 33:45.158
You can come up
the back entrance.

33:45.225 --> 33:47.327
At least you could've
if I knew you were coming.

33:47.394 --> 33:50.063
Well, I thought if I
went up there, I wouldn't
be able to get you down here.

33:50.130 --> 33:52.099
Now that you're down here,
let's go see Nora

33:52.165 --> 33:55.169
at your mother's
and let's let her meet John.

33:55.235 --> 33:56.904
He's been sleeping
for a long time,

33:56.970 --> 33:58.805
and he'll be in
a great mood later.

33:58.872 --> 34:00.407
It's a perfect night
to do this.

34:00.474 --> 34:02.709
I have the flu.
You do not have the flu.

34:02.776 --> 34:04.611
Prove it.

34:13.921 --> 34:15.189
You wanna have sex?

34:15.255 --> 34:17.257
Of course I wanna have sex.
You wanna have sex?

34:17.324 --> 34:21.195
No. I was just proving
that you don't have the flu.

34:21.261 --> 34:23.263
Come on.
Let's go.
I'm not going.

34:23.330 --> 34:26.266
If you don't go, you're gonna
miss your son seeing your mother
for the first time.

34:26.333 --> 34:28.802
I was with John
when he met my mother
for the first time.

34:28.869 --> 34:32.172
And I don't care
if I'm not there when he meets
Nora for the first time.

34:32.239 --> 34:34.908
Go ahead. Take him.
Okay. I'll take him.

34:36.176 --> 34:38.612
Come on.
I talked to your moms today,

34:38.679 --> 34:40.614
and they both really want you
to be there tonight.

34:40.681 --> 34:42.349
I want the two of us
to do this together.

34:42.416 --> 34:44.251
Did they tell you
that my mother is gay?

34:45.419 --> 34:47.521
And she didn't even tell me.

34:47.588 --> 34:49.056
And why do you think
that is?

34:51.158 --> 34:53.327
[phone ringing]

34:58.031 --> 34:59.366
[beeps]
Hello?

34:59.433 --> 35:02.269
Hey, Adrian. I'm so sorry.
I'm running a little late.

35:02.336 --> 35:05.672
That's okay.
It's not like Poppie's Tacos
takes reservations.

35:05.739 --> 35:08.308
I know, but you know how busy
that place gets later on.

35:08.375 --> 35:10.110
Oh, you know what?

35:10.177 --> 35:12.212
Is it even open this early?

35:12.279 --> 35:15.649
I don't think it's open
this early.
It's a late-night place.

35:15.716 --> 35:17.518
So you know what?
Take your time.
I'll have a snack.

35:17.584 --> 35:20.387
No, no. It's open.
I checked.

35:20.454 --> 35:23.390
It's open, and I'm gonna
go ahead and have my driver
pick you up,

35:23.457 --> 35:25.025
and then he'll pick me up.

35:25.092 --> 35:26.760
What?
[chuckles]

35:26.827 --> 35:29.329
No, that's okay.
That's not necessary.

35:29.396 --> 35:30.697
I can come pick you up.

35:30.764 --> 35:34.001
Nah. Come on.
Let's get Mike to drive us.

35:34.067 --> 35:37.771
It'll be fun.
We can make out
in the back seat.

35:37.838 --> 35:39.173
And besides,

35:39.239 --> 35:41.275
he's already in the front
of your house,

35:41.341 --> 35:44.278
and apparently neither you
or your parents
are answering the door.

35:44.344 --> 35:47.948
What? They're not even here.
They went out to dinner.

35:48.015 --> 35:50.817
Ruben talked my mom into
going out somehow even though
she was cooking dinner.

35:50.884 --> 35:53.187
All right.
Well, he's out front
whenever you're ready.

35:53.253 --> 35:54.555
Okay. I'll see you
in a few minutes.

35:54.621 --> 35:57.357
Bye.
Bye, Ben.

35:57.424 --> 35:58.425
[beeps]

35:59.526 --> 36:01.228
I think this is
where we say good-bye.

36:01.295 --> 36:03.263
Mm-hmm.

36:03.330 --> 36:05.199
Thank you, Mom.

36:05.265 --> 36:07.968
[chuckles]

36:08.035 --> 36:09.970
Ben, you are a charmer.

36:10.037 --> 36:11.972
And Adrian
is a very lucky girl.

36:12.039 --> 36:13.974
Well, except, of course
she got pregnant

36:14.041 --> 36:15.976
when she didn't really
wanna get pregnant.

36:16.043 --> 36:18.912
But, anyway, she's lucky
to have you in her life.

36:20.247 --> 36:22.683
Welcome to the family, son.

36:24.284 --> 36:26.286
Thank you, Dad.

36:49.510 --> 36:50.511
[knocks]

36:50.577 --> 36:54.248
Hey, wanna go get something
to eat?

36:54.314 --> 36:56.884
Moose is hungry.
Could you just
pick up something?

36:56.950 --> 36:58.519
I'm busy.
With?

36:58.585 --> 37:01.488
My biology project.
It's Saturday night.

37:01.555 --> 37:04.558
Yeah, it's Saturday night,
and I got really interested
in doing this,

37:04.625 --> 37:06.527
so I'm doing this.

37:06.593 --> 37:09.263
And you can just
pick up something for me.

37:09.329 --> 37:11.632
Or I'll eat later.
I'll make myself a sandwich
or something.

37:11.698 --> 37:13.934
Whatcha doing?
Do you wanna see
what I'm doing?

37:14.001 --> 37:15.636
Of course I do.
No, you don't.

37:16.904 --> 37:19.239
You don't want me to do well
with homeschooling,

37:19.306 --> 37:22.509
because if I don't do well
or I don't like it,
I'll go back to school.

37:22.576 --> 37:24.611
Only I'm not
going back to school.

37:24.678 --> 37:26.980
I can tell you
that as of today,

37:27.047 --> 37:29.216
I am absolutely certain
I'm really going to like

37:29.283 --> 37:31.518
having my own curriculum
and assignments and teacher.

37:31.585 --> 37:33.720
Hey, if you like it,
you like it,

37:33.787 --> 37:35.722
but I think eventually
you're gonna miss
being around other people.

37:35.789 --> 37:37.891
Oh, you think so?
I do. I think so.

37:37.958 --> 37:40.194
Well, I don't think so.

37:40.260 --> 37:42.529
Here.
This is what I'm doing.

37:42.596 --> 37:44.598
It's on ecosystems.

37:44.665 --> 37:46.466
This is planet Earth,

37:46.533 --> 37:48.569
and this is a picture
of my world,

37:48.635 --> 37:51.839
a micro-system
of the larger planetary system.

37:51.905 --> 37:55.042
And when you put another life
into a shaky ecosystem,

37:55.108 --> 37:57.678
where people are fighting
for food, and water,
and attention,

37:57.744 --> 37:59.780
the system becomes vulnerable.

37:59.847 --> 38:01.815
And when there are just
too many lives

38:01.882 --> 38:03.817
added to an already
vulnerable system,

38:03.884 --> 38:05.352
the world collapses.

38:05.419 --> 38:08.822
And after the world collapses,
the survivors start over again,

38:10.090 --> 38:12.392
sometimes reproducing
with other species.

38:12.459 --> 38:14.595
Okay. The other species

38:14.661 --> 38:16.964
belongs in the second picture
where John is introduced,
don't you think?

38:17.030 --> 38:18.899
Well, I don't know.

38:18.966 --> 38:20.634
He wasn't part
of the family then,

38:20.701 --> 38:22.169
and it's not
the same family now.

38:22.236 --> 38:24.171
But I suppose we'll adapt.

38:24.238 --> 38:26.540
That's a sign of life,
isn't it-- adaptation?

38:28.175 --> 38:30.210
I'm choosing to adapt.

38:30.277 --> 38:32.446
I'm choosing to survive.

38:32.513 --> 38:34.681
I could even survive
and be happy.

38:34.748 --> 38:36.149
You're actually
turning this in?

38:36.216 --> 38:37.918
Are you kidding?
It's a work of art.

38:37.985 --> 38:39.853
That's not
a good picture of me

38:39.920 --> 38:41.989
or Amy or Ricky
or your mother.

38:42.055 --> 38:43.690
Yeah, but who's gonna see it?

38:43.757 --> 38:46.560
Me and some teacher
or the counselor,
and that's it.

38:46.627 --> 38:48.395
Maybe homeschooling
is a good idea.

38:48.462 --> 38:50.264
I think it is.

38:50.330 --> 38:52.633
I really think it is.

38:52.699 --> 38:55.102
I'm excited about this.

38:55.169 --> 38:58.539
I could never do this
in just a regular classroom with
all those people I don't miss.

38:58.605 --> 39:01.608
Okay, Ashley.
Maybe it will work for you.

39:01.675 --> 39:03.477
We'll try it.
And I'll try to be

39:03.544 --> 39:05.279
a little more enthusiastic
and involved.

39:05.345 --> 39:06.880
[claps]
Wanna talk about it
over pizza?

39:06.947 --> 39:09.316
Well, I'd really like
to keep working.

39:09.383 --> 39:11.418
Oh.

39:11.485 --> 39:13.187
So what do you think, John?

39:13.253 --> 39:15.656
Oh, he's so cute.

39:15.722 --> 39:17.958
That's what I say
all the time.
Yeah.

39:18.025 --> 39:19.359
You're so cute!

39:19.426 --> 39:21.195
Was Ricky this cute?

39:21.261 --> 39:23.897
Uh, yeah.

39:23.964 --> 39:26.066
Uh, yeah, I guess.

39:26.133 --> 39:28.969
He still loves you.

39:29.036 --> 39:32.806
I mean,
I know that a lot went on
for, like, a long, long time,

39:32.873 --> 39:36.043
but you're still his mother,
and he loves you.

39:36.109 --> 39:38.679
Well, that's the thing,
isn't it?

39:38.745 --> 39:42.382
Abused children
still wanna love their parents.

39:42.449 --> 39:44.551
They still wanna love them
no matter what they did to them.

39:45.752 --> 39:49.189
Sometimes it's like punishment
for the parents,

39:49.256 --> 39:54.027
because, you know,
the-- the abused kid loves you.

39:54.094 --> 39:56.463
'Cause you're like,
"I don't deserve this."

39:56.530 --> 39:59.233
You know? And-- And--

39:59.299 --> 40:02.469
You know, you don't
want them around, because
what if you hurt them again?

40:02.536 --> 40:05.339
How much hurt
can a person take, huh?

40:07.207 --> 40:08.842
Doesn't matter anymore, okay?

40:08.909 --> 40:11.378
We were both hurt.

40:11.445 --> 40:15.148
But we're not victims anymore,
all right?

40:15.215 --> 40:17.351
So let's stop acting
like victims

40:17.417 --> 40:18.619
and act like adults.

40:21.622 --> 40:25.626
Um, just gonna let
the two of you talk.

40:37.304 --> 40:38.639
Wow.

40:38.705 --> 40:40.674
That is a beautiful
picture right there

40:40.741 --> 40:43.677
of you and your son,
my grandson.

40:46.079 --> 40:49.650
Okay, I need a drink.
[chuckles]

40:49.716 --> 40:50.918
[clears throat]

40:53.554 --> 40:55.222
No, you don't need a drink.

40:55.289 --> 40:58.158
If anyone needs a drink,
I need a drink.
Do you drink?

40:58.225 --> 41:00.694
No, I don't drink.
I'm never gonna drink.

41:00.761 --> 41:03.430
Never. I have
no interest in it.

41:03.497 --> 41:06.500
The smell of alcohol
makes me sick to my stomach.

41:06.567 --> 41:08.235
I was just making a bad joke.

41:08.302 --> 41:10.671
Sometimes I do that
when I don't know
what else to say.

41:10.737 --> 41:13.507
Well, I don't know
what else to say either.

41:13.574 --> 41:14.408
[chuckles]

41:17.778 --> 41:19.079
Except that I'm gay.

41:21.114 --> 41:23.917
I wish you'd have told me
before you told other people.

41:23.984 --> 41:24.952
I'm sorry.

41:27.087 --> 41:28.589
I just didn't want
to tell you.

41:31.158 --> 41:32.559
Other people-- people know.

41:32.626 --> 41:33.894
Are you sure you're gay?

41:33.961 --> 41:35.863
Uh--
[laughs]

41:35.929 --> 41:39.099
All right, you're gay.
Whatever.

41:39.166 --> 41:42.636
Who's the girlfriend?
I want to meet your girlfriend.

41:42.703 --> 41:45.506
Is she your girlfriend
or more than that?

41:45.572 --> 41:47.407
She's my girlfriend.

41:47.474 --> 41:49.610
Yeah, um...

41:49.676 --> 41:51.612
and it's like, uh...

41:51.678 --> 41:57.150
the first real serious
relationship.

41:57.217 --> 41:59.186
I'd really like you
to meet her

41:59.253 --> 42:00.487
because I really like her.

42:00.554 --> 42:01.655
All right, I'll meet her.

42:01.722 --> 42:03.624
We met when I was incarcerated.

42:05.092 --> 42:08.362
She's a public defender.
She's great.

42:08.428 --> 42:12.432
Okay. I'll look forward
to meeting her.

42:12.499 --> 42:14.001
Thank you, Ricky.

42:15.669 --> 42:17.337
I mean that.

42:17.404 --> 42:20.507
Thank you for everything.

42:26.547 --> 42:27.548
Hey.

42:31.552 --> 42:33.620
Hi, John. Hi.

42:34.655 --> 42:36.356
I'm Nora.

42:36.423 --> 42:37.424
Grandma Nora.

42:39.993 --> 42:41.028
Yeah.

42:42.196 --> 42:44.198
Hey, you know what?

42:44.264 --> 42:47.167
If anyone ever harms you,

42:47.234 --> 42:49.636
I will kill them,

42:49.703 --> 42:51.939
and then my girlfriend's
gonna gate me out of jail.

42:52.005 --> 42:53.473
Yeah.

43:02.449 --> 43:04.685
What are you up to?
Nothing.

43:12.492 --> 43:14.561
You're crazy,
you know that?

43:14.628 --> 43:15.529
Yeah, I know that.

43:15.596 --> 43:17.598
Then again,
I'm crazy, too.

43:17.664 --> 43:19.399
Yeah, maybe a little bit.

43:19.466 --> 43:22.503
So we have the place
all to ourselves?

43:22.569 --> 43:24.104
All to ourselves.

43:24.171 --> 43:25.405
I love this.

43:36.083 --> 43:38.619
Ben--
I love you, Adrian.

43:40.320 --> 43:41.989
I really love you.

43:42.055 --> 43:43.357
You do--

43:43.423 --> 43:45.425
You do love me,
don't you?

43:45.492 --> 43:46.760
I do. I do love you.

43:48.395 --> 43:50.397
I'd be honored
if you'd be my wife.

43:50.464 --> 43:51.598
Yes.

43:51.665 --> 43:53.233
You don't want
to think it over?

43:53.300 --> 43:55.302
No!

44:03.243 --> 44:04.678
I love you, Ben.

44:04.745 --> 44:08.348
Wait. I think you said
you loved me, right?

44:08.415 --> 44:10.984
Yeah, I did.
Yeah, okay.
I love you, too.

44:13.420 --> 44:15.789
Oh! She's moving.

44:17.457 --> 44:19.026
Here. She's moving right now.

44:20.827 --> 44:21.929
Oh--
[chuckles]

44:43.750 --> 44:46.320
[no audible dialogue]
