01:51.278 --> 01:53.738
Yankee-nine-niner,
what are your coordinates?

01:53.822 --> 01:56.073
Zero-two-zero, flight level one-five.

01:56.158 --> 01:58.618
We're above release point Echo-Bravo-one.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.036
Move in and check it out.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.746
Roger. Moving in.

02:09.253 --> 02:13.925
Food riot in progress.
Approximately 1,500 civilians.

02:14.301 --> 02:15.635
No weapons evident.

02:15.719 --> 02:19.472
Proceed with Plan Alpha.
Eliminate anything moving.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.474
I said the crowd is unarmed.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.142
There are lots of women
and children down there.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.810
All they want is food, for God's sake!

02:24.895 --> 02:27.647
As you were, Richards.
Proceed with Plan Alpha.

02:27.731 --> 02:29.649
All rioters must be eliminated.

02:30.442 --> 02:33.986
The hell with you.
I will not fire on helpless people.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.948
Abort mission. We return back to base.

02:37.032 --> 02:39.325
- Lieutenant Saunders, do you copy?
- Affirmative.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.411
Take command.
Detain Richards and proceed as ordered.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.081
Richards, what the fuck are you doing?

02:45.165 --> 02:46.540
Shit. Let's get him!

02:55.467 --> 02:58.427
- God damn it!
- Shit, we're pitching over!

02:59.805 --> 03:01.889
I got it! I got control!

03:04.226 --> 03:06.644
They said detain him. Don't drop him.

03:13.652 --> 03:16.112
Richards, you're gonna fry for this.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.906
And I'll see you in hell.

03:32.129 --> 03:34.255
Come on, keep digging.

03:35.507 --> 03:38.050
- What's the holdup?
- This one's had it.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.220
Watch the detonator.

03:43.807 --> 03:46.934
Get that garbage out of here. Move!

04:49.206 --> 04:51.624
Hey, Charley,
did you see The Running Man last night?

04:51.708 --> 04:54.502
I never miss it. I even won 500 bucks.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.630
You lucky bastard.

04:58.423 --> 05:01.884
Work crew coming through.
Prisoner transfer to post.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.469
Okay. Hang on.

05:03.553 --> 05:06.639
Lenny, this is the East Perimeter.
Fresh meat just got here.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.432
Shut down the deadline.

05:08.517 --> 05:11.435
Affirmative. Shutting down now.
Stand clear.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.523
Access code pending.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.151
Verified. Perimeter deactivated.

05:19.236 --> 05:20.903
Sonic deadline is down.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.823
- Sonic deadline is down.
- Okay, assholes, move it. Move it.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.533
Let's go. Let's go!

05:25.617 --> 05:28.869
Get out the lead or lose your head.
Come on!

05:45.637 --> 05:48.889
East Perimeter here.
New prisoners are all in compound.

05:48.974 --> 05:49.974
We're clear.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.309
Affirmative. Activating deadline.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.521
What are you looking at? Get out of here.

05:55.605 --> 05:59.859
Sonic deadline is up. Sonic deadline is up.

06:00.360 --> 06:05.322
Prisoner restraint collars armed.
Prisoner restraint collars armed.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.481
Give you a lift?

06:39.566 --> 06:40.566
No, no!

06:46.865 --> 06:49.241
- Get it open.
- I got it. I got it.

06:49.326 --> 06:53.329
- Repeat the code.
- I did. 653...

06:53.413 --> 06:54.872
Shit! It's not working.

06:58.877 --> 07:01.212
- You're a hell of an actor, Laughlin.
- Who was acting?

07:01.296 --> 07:03.047
Well, you're still alive, aren't you?

07:06.509 --> 07:08.260
- Repeat that code.
- Okay.

07:12.849 --> 07:15.809
Weiss, what's the holdup? Come on!

07:15.894 --> 07:17.978
The linking computer's denying the code.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.775
It must be the walls in here
blocking the signal.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.694
- It's not happening.
- Then we try it outside. Move!

07:34.454 --> 07:36.664
Hurry up! Let's go! Come on!

07:36.831 --> 07:38.374
Get out of the way. Move!

07:39.459 --> 07:41.335
Open the gates! Open the gates!

07:46.508 --> 07:47.841
Go ahead! Do it!

07:47.926 --> 07:50.386
Shut off the deadline
or we all lose our heads!

08:01.773 --> 08:04.692
The system's locked.
Must be an encryption lockout.

08:04.776 --> 08:05.985
Damn!

08:07.570 --> 08:11.115
Perimeter deactivated.
Perimeter deactivated.

08:11.199 --> 08:14.660
- All right! All right!
- Sonic deadline is down.

08:14.744 --> 08:17.663
- Prisoner restraint collars disarmed.
- Chico! Amigo!

08:17.747 --> 08:21.583
Chico! Come back! The deadline's still up.

08:22.627 --> 08:25.504
He's not going to make it.
That collar's going to blow.

08:25.588 --> 08:26.630
Sonic deadline is up.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.090
Chico!

08:30.427 --> 08:32.344
Prisoner restraint collars armed.

08:32.886 --> 08:34.554
No, Chico!

08:34.639 --> 08:38.267
Sonic deadline is up. Sonic deadline is up.

Prisoner restraint collars armed.

Perimeter deactivated.

08:57.662 --> 08:59.955
Perimeter deactivated.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.077
Please observe and obey.

09:38.161 --> 09:41.497
Zone passes are required at all times.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.791
Display passes properly.

09:43.875 --> 09:49.546
All inter-zone workers with day passes are
reminded that curfew begins at midnight.

09:49.631 --> 09:54.343
Anyone without a valid zone card after
midnight will be permanently detained.

09:54.719 --> 09:59.723
Cadre kids, don't forget,
October is bonus recruitment month.

09:59.808 --> 10:03.394
Earn a double bonus
for reporting a family member.

10:03.478 --> 10:06.772
ICS, your entertainment
and information network,

10:06.856 --> 10:09.942
reminds you seeing is believing.

10:10.777 --> 10:15.948
What's the number one television show
in the whole wide world?

10:16.032 --> 10:19.118
- The Running Man!
- Yes!

10:19.202 --> 10:21.328
Yes, it's The Running Man.

10:21.413 --> 10:25.416
Four hundred square blocks of danger,
destruction, demolition, and...

10:25.500 --> 10:27.793
You guys want to buy a hot stereo?

10:27.877 --> 10:31.004
- Stevie.
- Laughlin. Glad you guys made it.

10:31.089 --> 10:34.466
...unstoppable network stalkers
give criminals,

10:34.551 --> 10:38.303
traitors and enemies of the state
exactly what they deserve.

10:38.388 --> 10:41.890
Sundays, 8:00 to 11:00,
on ICS Channel One. Be there!

10:41.975 --> 10:44.810
Produced in cooperation
with the Zone Four Department of Justice.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.145
All rights reserved.

10:46.229 --> 10:50.232
The Running Man,
America's favorite game show.

10:53.278 --> 10:57.990
A child, your child, happy, loving, caring...

10:58.074 --> 11:01.452
Can you believe this shit?
Twenty-four hours a day.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.288
- Seven days a week.
- Don't listen to it.

11:04.372 --> 11:08.083
I worry about the kids.
The network shuts down the schools.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.836
The kids are either in hiding
or getting basic training,

11:10.920 --> 11:12.963
brainwashed by the TV.

11:13.047 --> 11:15.966
We can jam the network
once we find the uplink to the satellite.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.926
Then we'll broadcast the truth.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.929
Truth? Hasn't been very popular lately.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.099
Can't find the code or the uplink.

11:24.184 --> 11:28.437
Don't know where the network
hid something that big, but they managed.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.231
Stevie, would you mind?

11:33.610 --> 11:35.861
Goodbye, my lovely.

11:49.167 --> 11:52.377
You're one of the cops
who locked up all my friends,

11:52.462 --> 11:53.962
burned my songs.

11:54.047 --> 11:57.216
People like you took this country
and turned it into a jail.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.718
- We don't want his death on our hands.
- He's a cop.

11:59.802 --> 12:02.763
- He's the Butcher of Bakersfield.
- Come on, Mic.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.390
You can see through that crap.
It's network propaganda.

12:05.475 --> 12:06.517
We don't know that.

12:06.601 --> 12:08.310
We know we wouldn't be here
if he hadn't helped us.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.646
We also know he's not one of us.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.023
Perhaps now he's seen too much.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.567
I've seen too much?

12:15.652 --> 12:17.361
All I've seen is a bunch of low foreheads

12:17.445 --> 12:20.072
who think they can change the world
with dreams and talk.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.865
It's too late for that.

12:21.950 --> 12:25.285
If you're not ready to act,
give me a break and shut up.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.668
Nothing worth losing
your head over, though, huh?

12:35.964 --> 12:37.339
You got it.

12:42.679 --> 12:43.929
Hey, get out of here.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.909
Well, there's your ride. It's all set.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.537
Nothing like first class.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.290
SeÃ±orita, seÃ±orita. You want to come in?

13:11.374 --> 13:13.333
Yeah. Hey, you, too?

13:14.043 --> 13:15.627
I guess this is it.

13:15.712 --> 13:18.463
Now you, Weiss,
stay out of the National Database, okay?

13:18.548 --> 13:22.676
And you, Laughlin, stop trying to teach
the constitution to the street punks.

13:22.760 --> 13:26.013
- See you guys at the 10-year prison reunion.
- You can still join us if you want to.

13:26.097 --> 13:28.515
No, thank you.
My brother's going to get me out of the city.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.476
Plus, I'm not into politics. I'm into survival.

13:31.561 --> 13:33.562
Nowadays, Fritz, it's the same thing.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.315
Laughlin, save it for the written test.
Good luck.

13:36.399 --> 13:37.983
Yeah, for all of us.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.078
We need you, Damon!

14:34.415 --> 14:38.085
Brenda, do you have this week's ratings,
or do I have to guess?

14:38.336 --> 14:41.713
They're the same as last week,
and those were the same all last month.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.883
I guess we've just peaked.
But it's not like we've dropped.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.968
Not likely. You're beautiful, sweetheart.

14:48.346 --> 14:49.971
- Sorry, Mr. Killian!
- Hey, that's all right.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.598
- What's your name?
- Dan.

14:51.683 --> 14:53.892
Dan, you're doing good work.
Looks beautiful. Don't worry.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.143
- Thank you.
- Okay?

14:55.228 --> 14:56.603
Thank you.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.524
Brenda, if that asshole
is mopping the floor tomorrow,

15:00.608 --> 15:03.902
you'll be mopping it
for the rest of the week. Let's go!

15:44.694 --> 15:46.695
Security code accepted.

16:09.260 --> 16:10.886
Edward?

16:12.597 --> 16:15.515
Damon, were you down in wardrobe yet?
They've got your new jackets.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.518
- They're fantastic!
- Who chose the colors?

16:18.895 --> 16:21.813
- Hey, how are my people today?
- Fine, sir. Thank you.

16:21.898 --> 16:24.691
You're looking good. Love that...
Tony! Tony!

16:24.776 --> 16:26.485
- What have you got for me?
- Damon, thank God.

16:26.569 --> 16:28.278
The Justice Department's been calling
every 10 minutes.

16:28.362 --> 16:31.823
Just give them an evasive answer.
Tell them to go fuck themselves.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.533
You got my coffee?

16:33.910 --> 16:36.578
- I want to know what we got, all right?
- All right. Let's see.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.292
Lights.

16:46.047 --> 16:49.090
Oh, God. Kitchen, toast and coffee.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.843
ICS Channel One.

16:56.182 --> 17:00.018
Are you ready for pain?
Are you ready for suffering?

17:00.228 --> 17:02.395
If the answer is yes,

17:02.480 --> 17:05.816
then you're ready
for Captain Freedom's Workout.

17:05.900 --> 17:09.361
Yes, it's America's own Captain Freedom,

17:09.444 --> 17:13.781
10-time national champion,
the greatest stalker to ever play the game.

17:13.866 --> 17:17.368
All right, now, all you runners,
ready, get set, go!

17:17.453 --> 17:20.704
We interrupt Captain Freedom's Workout
to bring you this urgent news bulletin.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.333
The city police are engaged
in a door-to-door search

17:23.416 --> 17:27.045
for Benjamin A. Richards,
known as the Butcher of Bakersfield.

17:27.630 --> 17:31.383
Richards, a former police officer,
was the helicopter pilot

17:31.467 --> 17:33.218
who went berserk 18 months ago,

17:33.302 --> 17:37.264
firing without warning
on a crowd of innocent civilians.

17:37.348 --> 17:41.309
If you see this man, do not approach him.
Contact your local block warden.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.895
He is considered armed and dangerous.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.897
Don't make a sound, you understand?

17:45.982 --> 17:48.567
Who are you? A friend of my brother's?

17:51.863 --> 17:54.406
- What are you talking about?
- This is his apartment.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.074
I moved in last month.

17:56.158 --> 17:59.035
They told me the last tenant
was taken away for...

17:59.120 --> 18:01.538
- Yes?
- For re-education.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.001
Help!

18:08.629 --> 18:10.338
El asesino is in my house!

18:10.506 --> 18:13.049
El Butcher of Bakersfield's in my bathroom!

18:13.134 --> 18:16.011
That's the ticket. No pain, no gain.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.472
Let go of me! Let me go! Let go!

18:19.807 --> 18:22.684
Now, listen to me,
because I'm only going to say this once.

18:22.768 --> 18:26.271
This is all a lie. I was framed.
I'm completely innocent.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.524
- Yeah, sure.
- Now, be quiet and stay still.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.818
I'm out of here in five minutes.

18:35.364 --> 18:38.116
Hi, this is Amber. I'm not home right now.

18:38.200 --> 18:42.454
I'm out somewhere having a wonderful time
with glamorous people in a fabulous place.

18:42.538 --> 18:46.625
So, when you hear the tone, control
your jealousy and leave your message.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.128
"Baby Face" March.

18:50.212 --> 18:52.213
Are you kidding me? Next.

18:52.298 --> 18:55.258
How's this one? Case 114. Schoolteacher.

18:55.343 --> 18:58.678
Killed his wife and his mother-in-law
at a faculty dinner party with a steak knife.

18:58.763 --> 19:00.722
Yeah. See I like that quality.

19:01.223 --> 19:04.267
He's the sort that the neighbors say,
"Such a quiet man,

19:04.352 --> 19:07.354
"but never too busy to say hello."
But look at him.

19:07.438 --> 19:10.941
He weighs 120 pounds.
He wouldn't last 30 seconds.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.068
Who else?

19:13.736 --> 19:17.030
What about those bank robbers?
The ones who made that suicide pact.

19:17.114 --> 19:20.492
- Did they commit suicide?
- Obviously not, Damon.

19:20.952 --> 19:22.452
Then they're unreliable.

19:22.536 --> 19:23.787
I got a friend at a talent agency.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.622
Maybe they've got an ax-murderer
or something.

19:25.706 --> 19:29.960
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Somebody with stamina.

19:30.044 --> 19:32.087
Tony. Tony.

19:33.547 --> 19:37.384
Pipe that feed in here now!
Take a look at this.

19:37.843 --> 19:41.012
This is yesterday's prison break. Hey. Look!

19:41.806 --> 19:45.976
Look at that mother move, huh?
Is he beautiful? Who is he?

19:46.060 --> 19:48.186
Are you kidding? That's Ben Richards.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.398
The cop from the massacre? Sensational.

19:51.482 --> 19:54.609
- Perfect contestant. I want him!
- You can't have him.

19:54.694 --> 19:55.735
Why not?

19:55.820 --> 19:58.697
Damon, you know our contract.
We never get military prisoners.

19:58.781 --> 20:01.533
Who's a military prisoner?
He's still at large.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.785
Yeah? Well, they'll get him for me.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.996
Cadres can't have it both ways.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.958
They want ratings.
I can get 10 points for his biceps alone.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.002
Hello. Yeah, this is Killian.

20:12.086 --> 20:15.380
Get me the Justice Department,
Entertainment Division.

20:15.464 --> 20:20.427
No, hold that.
Operator, get me the President's agent.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.139
What is this?

20:24.640 --> 20:27.642
That's my synthesizer setup. I'm a musician.

20:29.854 --> 20:33.314
Well, I'm really a singer.
I write music for the network.

20:33.399 --> 20:36.943
Have you heard of their theme song,
We Bring You Joy, We Bring You Strife?

20:37.028 --> 20:38.528
Well, I wrote that.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.739
You must be very proud of yourself.

20:42.033 --> 20:45.660
- It's really nothing.
- Look at this.

20:46.620 --> 20:51.458
They're all on the censored list.
And look what we have here.

20:51.876 --> 20:54.252
This looks like black-market clothing.

20:54.712 --> 20:56.921
And you wrote the network jingle.

20:57.006 --> 20:58.840
Come on. Everybody does it.

20:59.800 --> 21:00.967
Money.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.345
That's what I need, money.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.972
That money's
not going to do you any good.

21:06.057 --> 21:07.432
You know,
you won't be able to leave this quad.

21:07.516 --> 21:10.852
- You don't have a travel pass.
- You do.

21:13.022 --> 21:14.355
Now I do.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.193
Let's see.

21:22.573 --> 21:26.034
Now where should we go?
Maybe someplace warm.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.453
I need to work on my tan anyway.

21:29.205 --> 21:31.623
You see, you get so pale in prison.

21:32.249 --> 21:34.542
There you are. Good.

21:35.544 --> 21:39.631
Now, I'm going to untie you,
and then you're going to get dressed,

21:40.174 --> 21:45.053
- and then you're going to come with me.
- Yeah? Well, why should I?

21:46.138 --> 21:49.724
Because I'm going to say please.

21:53.729 --> 21:56.523
Well, why didn't you say so?

21:57.608 --> 22:01.653
All flights to Pretoria, Tutuville
and Mandelaburg are on schedule.

22:01.737 --> 22:05.115
Flights to Anaconda, Chile,
are delayed several hours.

22:05.741 --> 22:09.077
All Mideast flights
are canceled until further notice.

22:10.663 --> 22:14.916
You'll never pull this off, you know.
You are unarmed, outnumbered.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.419
Face it. You're screwed.

22:18.504 --> 22:22.132
So, why don't you just forget about all this
and turn yourself in?

22:22.216 --> 22:25.718
You know,
you have a very negative attitude.

22:26.387 --> 22:29.139
Now remember,
I can break your neck like a chicken's.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.268
Travel pass.

22:36.230 --> 22:38.356
What a beautiful day today.

22:38.440 --> 22:41.109
I can practically taste
those piÃ±a coladas already.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.153
- Right, sweetheart?
- Miss.

22:43.821 --> 22:46.281
You didn't put it in your purse again,
did you?

22:46.365 --> 22:50.285
Last vacation, she put my credit cards in
there and we couldn't find them for a week.

22:51.245 --> 22:52.787
Here, could you hold on to this please?

22:52.872 --> 22:56.291
You want to move it, up there?
We got a plane to catch.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.917
Go on. Go on.

22:58.711 --> 23:02.213
You can't live with them
and you can't live without them.

23:08.637 --> 23:12.891
I'm warning you, I get sick.
Air sick, car sick.

23:13.475 --> 23:16.269
I'm going to throw up all over you.

23:16.353 --> 23:18.980
Go ahead. It won't show on this shirt.

23:33.996 --> 23:36.414
Help! He's Ben Richards!

23:36.498 --> 23:38.708
He's trying to kidnap me! Help!

23:38.792 --> 23:41.878
Out of my way! Get the hell out of my way!

23:42.963 --> 23:45.298
Positive ID. Benjamin A. Richards.

23:45.382 --> 23:46.883
Priority one fugitive. Repeat.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.635
All units, terminal seven.

24:05.819 --> 24:08.947
All right. We're on him.
Close it in. Close it in.

24:14.703 --> 24:17.163
Go, go, go. Move!

24:18.290 --> 24:20.208
You move and you're dead!

24:39.311 --> 24:44.065
Hi, cutie pie.
You know, one of us is in deep trouble.

24:45.859 --> 24:48.861
- Do you know who I am?
- I've seen you before.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.490
You're the asshole on TV.

24:52.574 --> 24:55.618
That's funny. I was going to say
the same thing about you.

24:55.703 --> 24:59.539
I saw the video of your prison break.
Sensational.

24:59.957 --> 25:03.835
Ben, I think we might be able
to help each other out.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.879
I've got the brains, and you've got talent.

25:07.256 --> 25:12.635
No, you've got more. You've got talent,
you've got charisma and you've got balls.

25:13.304 --> 25:16.097
That's why I pulled a few strings
to get you here.

25:16.598 --> 25:20.268
And that's why I'd like you to volunteer

25:20.519 --> 25:23.938
to appear on tomorrow's broadcast

25:24.273 --> 25:27.525
- of The Running Man.
- Fuck you.

25:29.486 --> 25:33.197
You're a brilliant conversationalist, Ben.
A trifle limited, but brilliant.

25:34.283 --> 25:35.283
Take a look.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.492
How long are they going to keep us here?

25:36.577 --> 25:39.746
Isn't that your old schoolteacher
buddy there, huh?

25:39.830 --> 25:43.207
And there's your other buddy, the one
who helped you in the prison infirmary.

25:43.292 --> 25:45.752
Weiss, Laughlin.

25:47.129 --> 25:51.799
- What are you going to do with them?
- Well, that's really up to you, Ben.

25:52.301 --> 25:56.846
You see, I created The Running Man,
but I don't make the rules.

25:56.930 --> 25:59.098
I've got a contract with the government.

25:59.183 --> 26:01.517
They send me the convicts,
I put them on the show.

26:01.602 --> 26:02.977
Well, you've seen it, right?

26:03.062 --> 26:09.317
And you know at least you've got a chance,
but your buddies, Ben, they're the B-list.

26:11.236 --> 26:14.280
So, if you don't do
The Running Man tomorrow,

26:14.365 --> 26:20.453
Weiss and Laughlin
are going to go on in your place.

26:21.872 --> 26:23.498
What do you say?

26:38.263 --> 26:41.265
We'll see how far this clown runs
when we're done with him.

26:41.350 --> 26:43.393
Starting barium IV.

26:44.728 --> 26:48.773
- That's a go.
- Reading all systems down the line.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.025
Your bird is singing loud and clear.

26:52.694 --> 26:54.153
All systems check out.

26:54.238 --> 26:56.114
Mandibular restraint.

27:02.413 --> 27:04.497
Interphalangic injection.

27:09.545 --> 27:11.796
Deltoid IM injection.

27:13.549 --> 27:16.551
- Procedure completed.
- Takes care of him.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.557
Sons of bitches.

27:23.642 --> 27:26.602
He's wrapped. Knock him out till show time.

27:58.886 --> 28:01.220
These guys, they never stop competing.

28:01.305 --> 28:03.389
I get thirsty just watching them.

28:03.474 --> 28:07.602
But in my line of work,
I can't afford that filled-up feeling.

28:07.978 --> 28:13.608
That's why I drink Cadre Cola.
It hits the spot.

28:15.652 --> 28:19.197
The capture of renegade police officer
and mass murderer Ben Richards

28:19.281 --> 28:22.450
was filmed yesterday
by runway security cameras.

28:22.534 --> 28:25.786
Richards' hostage, Amber Mendez,
was unharmed.

28:25.871 --> 28:28.664
Some airport personnel were not so lucky,

28:28.749 --> 28:31.709
like the ticket agent and security guard
Richards shot

28:31.793 --> 28:34.795
at point blank range
when he arrived at the airport.

28:34.880 --> 28:35.880
But that's not true.

28:35.964 --> 28:40.801
They were taken to Cadre Memorial Hospital
where they remain in guarded condition.

28:40.886 --> 28:43.679
And now back to Climbing for Dollars.

29:03.534 --> 29:05.326
Mr. Richards.

29:06.370 --> 29:09.163
I'm your court-appointed theatrical agent.

29:15.796 --> 29:17.088
It's time.

29:27.641 --> 29:30.309
And digital effects number one.

29:30.394 --> 29:33.020
Roll process mod.

29:36.024 --> 29:38.025
Okay, you guys. Hey, here we are. Come on.

29:40.862 --> 29:42.196
Move, move. Come on.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.366
Hey, over here. Here!

29:46.827 --> 29:48.369
Big crowd tonight.

29:49.663 --> 29:51.581
Better there than in the streets.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.225
Buzzsaw, touch me! Buzzsaw!

30:13.270 --> 30:18.316
- Who's the number one stalker?
- Buzzsaw.

30:18.400 --> 30:21.235
Slice those runners for me, man.

30:21.320 --> 30:24.614
He touched me! Did you guys see that?
Buzzsaw touched me!

30:40.964 --> 30:42.965
Look at my power.

31:15.165 --> 31:17.249
Don't touch the hair!

31:49.282 --> 31:51.617
Look, do you have any more change?
I ran out.

31:51.702 --> 31:54.495
- Yeah.
- Six dollars. Jesus, this place...

31:56.581 --> 31:58.290
You're lucky to be alive.

31:58.375 --> 32:02.294
I mean that guy just killed, what,
60, 80, 100 people?

32:03.296 --> 32:06.924
- Not according to him, he hasn't.
- Well, that's what they all say.

32:07.008 --> 32:08.801
"...and whereas the victim contests this,

32:08.885 --> 32:12.263
"whereas network and victim
have in past been combatants,

32:12.347 --> 32:17.101
"ad hoc de facto,
the parties herein have agreed to disagree.

32:17.185 --> 32:19.645
"This is now mutually consented
to be de jure,

32:19.730 --> 32:22.606
"and therefore parties have certain
obligations to each other.

32:22.691 --> 32:25.067
"Respective rights and obligations..."

32:25.902 --> 32:31.907
Boy, you're lucky he didn't kill you, too.
Or rape you and kill you.

32:33.034 --> 32:34.869
Or kill you, then rape you.

32:35.036 --> 32:37.413
"Conflicts between your estate
and the network..."

32:37.497 --> 32:40.875
I mean, a guy like that,
what would stop him?

32:42.294 --> 32:44.545
Yeah, what would?

32:46.381 --> 32:49.008
Look, Amy, I have to pass on that drink.

32:49.092 --> 32:51.218
I just remembered
that I have some paperwork to do.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.304
- So, I'll catch you tomorrow, okay?
- And now, here's the producer

32:53.388 --> 32:57.558
of The Running Man,
and everyone's favorite showman,

32:57.642 --> 33:00.227
Damon Killian.

33:04.900 --> 33:07.359
Yeah! Thank you. You're beautiful.

33:08.236 --> 33:10.446
I love you. Yes!

33:11.406 --> 33:14.658
You're beautiful. Thank you.

33:20.123 --> 33:23.334
It's show time!

33:25.587 --> 33:26.837
Yeah, yeah!

33:29.591 --> 33:34.804
All right. Now, tell me,
what's the number one television show

33:34.888 --> 33:37.389
in the whole wide world?

33:37.474 --> 33:39.600
- The Running Man!
- The Running Man!

33:39.684 --> 33:44.396
- And who loves you and who do you love?
- Damon!

33:44.481 --> 33:47.024
- One more time!
- Damon!

33:47.108 --> 33:48.192
Yes!

33:51.238 --> 33:53.239
Phil, my announcer.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.783
I heard the warm-up today,
and I've got to tell you,

33:55.867 --> 33:59.453
honestly, Phil,
I don't think I've ever heard you funnier.

34:00.288 --> 34:03.374
I'm just kidding, guys.
You're great at your job.

34:03.458 --> 34:05.334
Too bad it isn't music!

34:06.962 --> 34:11.632
"Res ipsa loquitur ad infinitum
for cassettes, videotapes, bubble-chips,

34:11.716 --> 34:15.135
"and all other methods of recordings
known or unknown."

34:21.016 --> 34:22.601
Sign here.

34:23.103 --> 34:24.186
Hey.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.650
Here, here, here. Use my back, victim.

34:40.411 --> 34:41.996
Don't forget to send me a copy.

34:45.625 --> 34:48.585
...the love of my life, my number one fan,

34:48.670 --> 34:53.215
- Mrs. McArdle. How are you doing?
- Just fine.

34:53.300 --> 34:57.177
I want a kiss, now, a big kiss.
But remember, no tongues.

35:00.849 --> 35:03.434
- Bless you.
- Sit down, little darling.

35:03.518 --> 35:06.604
We have one hell of a show for you tonight.

35:06.688 --> 35:09.815
Phil, please, if you will,

35:09.900 --> 35:14.695
introduce tonight's guest runner.

35:15.030 --> 35:17.698
And watch that screen.

35:17.782 --> 35:20.492
Our star runner tonight
needs no introduction.

35:20.577 --> 35:22.036
He's Ben Richards,

35:22.120 --> 35:27.583
the brutal slayer of 60 men, women
and children in the Bakersfield massacre.

35:27.667 --> 35:33.213
Food riot in progress.
Approximately 1,500 civilians. Moving in.

35:33.465 --> 35:37.426
Yankee-nine-niner, the crowd in unarmed.
Repeat, unarmed.

35:37.510 --> 35:40.262
Abort attack.
Acknowledge, Yankee-nine-niner.

35:40.347 --> 35:43.265
- The hell with you!
- Lieutenant Saunders, take command.

35:43.350 --> 35:45.684
Detain Richards and return to base.

35:46.478 --> 35:49.772
Acknowledge, Yankee-nine-niner.
Acknowledge. Return to base.

35:49.856 --> 35:53.484
Those are innocent, unarmed people
down there! Cease fire! Cease fire!

36:01.868 --> 36:02.910
No.

36:17.884 --> 36:20.177
Well, we all know the aftermath.

36:20.261 --> 36:23.889
Grieving parents, orphaned children,

36:23.974 --> 36:27.267
a nation shocked to its very core.

36:28.228 --> 36:29.687
Here he is,

36:29.771 --> 36:33.524
ready to pay the price
for our home audience,

36:34.067 --> 36:39.113
in person, the Butcher of Bakersfield!

36:48.373 --> 36:50.040
- Look at him!
- Get him!

36:55.422 --> 36:56.422
Get him!

37:27.120 --> 37:30.330
Now, Ben Richards could have gone
to prison to pay his penalty,

37:30.415 --> 37:33.751
but instead, he volunteered
for The Running Man,

37:33.835 --> 37:35.502
- risking everything for a chance...
- Excuse me.

37:35.587 --> 37:39.673
...at our fabulous prizes
like a trial by jury, suspended sentence,

37:39.758 --> 37:41.800
maybe even a full pardon,

37:41.885 --> 37:46.221
like our previous winners,
Whitman, Price and Haddad.

37:46.306 --> 37:50.100
You remember them.
Whitman, Price and Haddad.

37:50.185 --> 37:55.230
There they are and at this very moment,
they're basking under the Maui sun,

37:55.565 --> 37:59.359
their debt to society paid in full.

38:00.028 --> 38:01.361
Speaking of prizes,

38:01.446 --> 38:04.323
you don't have to be a menace
to society to be a winner,

38:04.407 --> 38:07.618
'cause you folks in the audience,
you'll get a chance, too.

38:07.702 --> 38:10.871
Phil, tell our friends
what they can win today.

38:10.955 --> 38:14.374
Damon, how about a year's supply
of Orthopure procreation pills,

38:14.459 --> 38:15.459
both adult and kiddy sizes,

38:15.543 --> 38:18.462
and the latest edition
of The Running Man home game?

38:18.546 --> 38:22.382
Ben, I know you're just dying
to get into that game zone

38:22.467 --> 38:26.595
and show us that same determination
you showed up in Bakersfield.

38:26.679 --> 38:30.224
Well, first I've got a little surprise for you.

38:33.478 --> 38:36.855
We all know you're a big, tough guy, Ben,

38:36.940 --> 38:38.649
but that doesn't mean that you're a loner,

38:38.733 --> 38:43.403
and it takes a big man
to admit that he needs his friends.

38:43.905 --> 38:46.406
We didn't want to break up
a winning team, Ben,

38:46.491 --> 38:50.536
so here they are,
ready to go for broke right by your side.

38:51.079 --> 38:54.998
Ladies and gentlemen, Ben's buddies,

38:55.500 --> 39:00.003
Harold Weiss and William Laughlin!

39:00.755 --> 39:02.798
Son of a bitch.

39:07.095 --> 39:08.804
You know how this works.

39:08.888 --> 39:12.766
The game zone is divided
into 400 square blocks,

39:12.851 --> 39:15.477
left over from the big quake of '97,

39:15.562 --> 39:18.605
and I don't think any of us
will ever forget that.

39:19.482 --> 39:22.860
Once inside the zone,
the runners have three hours.

39:22.944 --> 39:25.821
They've got to go
through all four game quads.

39:25.905 --> 39:28.866
Three hours or less,
and they're going to need every second,

39:28.950 --> 39:31.034
'cause you know who's on their tail?

39:31.119 --> 39:33.036
The stalkers!

39:33.121 --> 39:35.873
- Who?
- The stalkers!

39:35.957 --> 39:40.460
- And you know what happens then.
- Anything goes!

39:41.129 --> 39:43.797
- What?
- Anything goes!

39:43.882 --> 39:50.345
Right! Without further ado,
it's time to start running!

40:00.148 --> 40:03.567
On your marks, get set...

40:03.902 --> 40:07.029
Killian, I'll be back.

40:10.825 --> 40:12.659
Only in a rerun.

40:13.745 --> 40:14.786
Go!

40:19.250 --> 40:21.752
- Go!
- You son of a bitch!

40:21.836 --> 40:24.630
Go! Yes!

40:32.138 --> 40:35.140
...team in position.
- Lock down terminus impact net.

40:47.153 --> 40:51.073
- All systems go.
- Vacuum sleds passing checkpoint one.

42:00.268 --> 42:01.810
Come on, get up!

42:09.527 --> 42:12.446
Edith Wiggins, come on down!

42:18.953 --> 42:19.953
Yeah!

42:25.877 --> 42:29.713
Edith, you look like you might have done
a little stalking yourself.

42:30.715 --> 42:34.051
All right. Now, we need you
to give me the name of the stalker

42:34.135 --> 42:37.471
that we send out to hunt down
those three desperate criminals.

42:37.555 --> 42:40.057
- Okay.
- Give me 10 seconds please.

42:43.478 --> 42:45.729
Place your bets. Place your bets.

42:51.903 --> 42:53.362
Time's up.

42:53.446 --> 42:54.905
No more bets.

42:54.989 --> 42:57.032
Come on. Back off, back off. Come on.

42:57.116 --> 43:00.369
- I don't know, they're all so good.
- Quickly.

43:00.453 --> 43:02.746
Well, my husband and my little boy,
they have their favorites,

43:02.830 --> 43:06.625
- but I like my men big and cuddly.
- Yeah?

43:06.918 --> 43:09.127
- Who is it?
- Subzero!

43:09.545 --> 43:11.713
All right. Okay.

43:11.798 --> 43:16.510
We're looking for Subzero!

43:24.852 --> 43:27.687
And now, our first stalker of the evening,

43:27.772 --> 43:31.358
a Cadre trophy champion
with over 30 lifetime kills.

43:31.442 --> 43:33.735
Let's welcome the incredible ice-man

43:33.820 --> 43:38.198
who slices his enemies limb from limb
into quivering, bloody sushi,

43:38.282 --> 43:40.617
Professor Subzero!

44:01.681 --> 44:03.974
Move. Move it.

44:04.684 --> 44:06.351
Come on. Let's go!

44:28.082 --> 44:31.960
Damon, here in the locker room
there's a lot of excitement, here,

44:32.044 --> 44:33.462
a lot of adrenaline.

44:33.546 --> 44:38.300
The stalkers know there's
400 square blocks of game zone out there

44:38.384 --> 44:41.344
and anything can happen
in the next three hours.

44:42.263 --> 44:43.889
I remember once when I was in the...

44:43.973 --> 44:48.768
Sorry, Cap, I've just been informed,
the runners have entered the first quad.

44:48.853 --> 44:51.062
Let's go there now, live!

44:58.446 --> 45:01.406
- What are we doing?
- Faster, Laughlin. Faster.

45:01.491 --> 45:02.657
Keep going.

45:07.788 --> 45:09.164
Come on, come on, bring your money.

45:09.248 --> 45:10.874
Come on. Give it to me. Come on.

45:10.958 --> 45:13.418
Fresh blood, first dibs. You pay
your money, you make your choice.

45:13.503 --> 45:14.753
Come on. How about you?

45:22.053 --> 45:23.386
It's cold.

45:41.239 --> 45:42.656
What is this?

45:53.501 --> 45:55.085
Guess they want us to stay.

46:02.802 --> 46:07.097
Subzero does it again. A triple hit!

46:07.557 --> 46:11.434
Let's get out of here. Come on!
Weiss, come on! Go.

46:40.715 --> 46:42.799
Banzai!

46:43.843 --> 46:48.221
Look at this, an ICS home video. Yeah!

46:48.681 --> 46:54.060
And The Running Man
home version, right here.

46:54.395 --> 46:56.521
Come on, get me out of here, you guys!

46:57.607 --> 47:00.025
Hang on, Weiss. I'm coming.

47:07.950 --> 47:10.327
- Come on, big boy!
- Yeah!

47:11.245 --> 47:12.412
Richards?

47:13.372 --> 47:15.874
Will, get me out of here, you guys!

47:21.422 --> 47:22.964
Will, look out!

47:31.849 --> 47:33.266
Kill that son of a bitch!

47:42.401 --> 47:44.486
Come on! Yeah, Yeah!

48:27.029 --> 48:28.947
Hey, Killian!

48:31.492 --> 48:33.952
Here is Subzero,

48:34.036 --> 48:36.538
now, plain zero.

48:48.342 --> 48:52.554
Ladies and gentlemen, this is just horrible.

48:54.181 --> 48:58.351
Words can't express
what we're all feeling at this very moment.

49:01.230 --> 49:03.523
A great champion has fallen.

49:04.567 --> 49:08.570
We'll be back
right after these important messages.

49:09.739 --> 49:11.322
Pull!

49:12.742 --> 49:14.451
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

49:16.871 --> 49:20.165
- What the hell is that?
- It's gas.

49:20.750 --> 49:22.625
- Let's get out of here. Come on.
- Come on.

49:22.710 --> 49:26.671
- I'm sure glad we took care of Subzero.
- Yeah, he was a real pain in the neck.

49:27.673 --> 49:29.924
I know... I know a stalker died.

49:31.177 --> 49:33.636
Well, it had to happen sooner or later.

49:35.139 --> 49:37.474
Yeah, well it is a contact sport, right?

49:39.393 --> 49:43.480
Yeah, see, but you guys at Justice,
you cannot have it both ways.

49:43.564 --> 49:48.526
You want ratings, you want people in front
of the TV sets instead of picket lines.

49:48.611 --> 49:51.905
Well, you ain't going to get that
with reruns of Gilligan's Island.

49:53.073 --> 49:54.574
Gilligan's Island.

49:57.244 --> 49:59.829
Yeah, yeah, the one with the boat!

50:06.629 --> 50:09.672
Fireball! Fireball!

50:09.757 --> 50:11.674
Yeah, Buzzsaw!

50:11.759 --> 50:12.759
Leon?

50:13.093 --> 50:18.014
I don't know. I think maybe Dynamo,
but Buzzsaw was last year's champion.

50:18.849 --> 50:20.475
I can't decide!

50:20.559 --> 50:22.435
Then don't decide, Leon.

50:22.520 --> 50:25.480
Hard decisions call for hard solutions.

50:25.564 --> 50:29.776
And here are two hard-asses
ready to step in and take charge.

50:30.236 --> 50:32.570
You asked for them, Leon. You got them.

50:32.655 --> 50:36.699
Here they are, Buzzsaw and Dynamo!

50:37.743 --> 50:42.372
Phil, tell us all about
this champion tag team.

50:42.832 --> 50:44.374
Let's give a down-home welcome

50:44.458 --> 50:48.336
to Buzzsaw Eddie Vatowski,
last season's leading stalker.

50:48.420 --> 50:52.382
Buzzsaw's Hammond and Gage chainsaws
are made of Trylon-coated Dura-steel,

50:52.466 --> 50:56.636
and can cut muscle, sinew, bone
or even solid steel!

51:04.311 --> 51:06.062
- Well?
- Ratings just jumped eight points

51:06.146 --> 51:07.397
right across the board.

51:07.481 --> 51:09.023
- Eight?
- Make that nine points.

51:09.108 --> 51:11.943
- I love Ben Richards.
- You want another surprise?

51:12.027 --> 51:13.194
- What?
- Remember the girl

51:13.279 --> 51:15.488
who was with Richards at the airport?

51:15.573 --> 51:17.532
- The one with the cute ass?
- This is cuter.

51:17.616 --> 51:21.160
They just caught her downstairs.
She was pulling the Bakersfield video.

51:22.538 --> 51:23.705
Would you please welcome...

51:23.789 --> 51:26.541
- Sensational.
...our third stalker of the evening,

51:26.625 --> 51:27.625
Dynamo!

51:58.574 --> 51:59.616
Thank you. You're beautiful.

51:59.700 --> 52:02.035
Well, it's been an exciting show
so far, right?

52:02.119 --> 52:04.621
We've had shocks, we've had surprises,

52:04.705 --> 52:08.082
and we thought,
"Why not one more surprise?"

52:09.376 --> 52:13.713
Will you please help me welcome
our mystery contestant,

52:13.797 --> 52:16.424
Ms. Amber Mendez.

52:16.508 --> 52:17.508
Stop that!

52:20.095 --> 52:21.638
- Let me go!
- Amber.

52:21.722 --> 52:26.309
Amber. Now, I understand
that you're single, Amber,

52:26.393 --> 52:28.811
and that you live on the West Side.

52:28.896 --> 52:30.939
And not surprisingly,

52:31.023 --> 52:36.736
she has flaunted the law
and traditional morality all of her life.

52:37.112 --> 52:40.073
Go ahead, tell some lies about me now.

52:40.157 --> 52:43.117
We don't lie. Phil, tell us all about her.

52:46.830 --> 52:48.498
It's clear. Come on.

52:48.582 --> 52:50.166
Weiss, what is it?

52:50.250 --> 52:53.795
The camera relay,
it's pointing into the zone, not up.

52:54.088 --> 52:56.255
- Who gives a damn?
- Come on.

52:58.092 --> 53:00.134
Hey, where are you going?

53:00.803 --> 53:04.097
Later, she cheated on college exams,

53:04.181 --> 53:10.186
had sexual relationships with two,
sometimes three different men in a year,

53:10.437 --> 53:14.565
and then she met Mad Dog Ben Richards.

53:14.650 --> 53:16.275
Her confederate.

53:17.152 --> 53:18.569
Her lover.

53:19.321 --> 53:21.030
That was a lie.

53:21.115 --> 53:25.660
Dear, dear, dear.
Let's reunite these little lovebirds.

53:26.870 --> 53:27.954
Go!

53:44.388 --> 53:46.639
It's got to be here somewhere.

53:47.433 --> 53:49.308
You want to tell me
what the hell is going on?

53:49.393 --> 53:50.685
All the relays are the same.

53:50.769 --> 53:52.603
They point into the middle
of the game zone.

53:52.688 --> 53:54.272
Now, sooner or later,
they're gonna connect,

53:54.356 --> 53:56.399
which means the uplink
to the network satellite is in there.

53:56.483 --> 53:58.901
No wonder Mic's people couldn't find it.
No one ever comes out here.

53:58.986 --> 54:00.695
If we can find that uplink,
we can crack the code.

54:00.779 --> 54:02.572
We get it to Mic,
and the underground will jam the network.

54:02.656 --> 54:03.948
- Jam the network?
- That's right.

54:04.033 --> 54:06.242
Jam it up your ass.
Forget this crazy uplink business!

54:06.326 --> 54:08.411
You're gonna get us all killed.
We've got to move on.

54:08.495 --> 54:11.581
- Let's go, move! Move!
- Weiss! Sorry, Ben.

54:15.586 --> 54:16.711
Christ.

54:31.852 --> 54:33.853
Stalkers, we've got a bead,

54:34.104 --> 54:38.232
20 degrees north, mark seven,
12 degrees east, mark two.

54:42.696 --> 54:44.072
- Yes!
- Come on, brothers.

54:44.156 --> 54:46.032
Let's win one for the Zero!

54:49.787 --> 54:53.414
"Uplinks. Underground.
Uplinks. Underground."

54:53.791 --> 54:56.250
If you guys don't shut up,
I'm going to uplink your ass

54:56.335 --> 54:59.337
and you'll be underground.
Watch out, the lights!

55:06.595 --> 55:09.514
- Let's get out of here.
- Someone's coming.

55:16.438 --> 55:19.065
Hey! Hey! Richards, wait! It's Amber!

55:19.358 --> 55:20.733
What the hell are you doing here?

55:20.818 --> 55:22.693
Well, you don't have
to beat the crap out of me!

55:22.778 --> 55:25.696
- You think I'm glad to be here?
- Who the hell is this?

55:27.074 --> 55:30.159
She's the one that turned me in
at the airport. Guess this is her reward.

55:30.244 --> 55:32.662
Yeah, go ahead. Make jokes.

55:32.746 --> 55:34.163
It's your fault I'm here.

55:34.248 --> 55:37.834
The police think I'm helping you out.
They even think I'm your girlfriend.

55:37.918 --> 55:39.085
Well, I can straighten that out.

55:39.169 --> 55:42.880
See this camera up there?
I can strangle you for the home audience.

55:42.965 --> 55:44.132
- Another relay.
- Where?

55:44.216 --> 55:45.341
- They're out here.
- Weiss!

55:45.425 --> 55:47.260
- What's he talking about?
- Come on.

55:47.344 --> 55:48.344
Let's go.

55:48.762 --> 55:50.930
Weiss! Over here! Over here!

55:59.064 --> 56:00.815
Richards, cuidado!

56:19.960 --> 56:21.752
You son of a bitch!

56:24.089 --> 56:26.465
Richards, help! Where are we going?

56:27.843 --> 56:29.135
Laughlin!

56:40.105 --> 56:42.315
- In here?
- Yeah, let's go.

56:44.902 --> 56:47.361
Give me your money. Okay.

56:55.787 --> 56:58.039
Hey, man, what are you doing? Hey!

56:59.291 --> 57:01.834
The resistance has been trying
to jam the network for five years,

57:01.919 --> 57:03.252
and this could be our chance.

57:03.337 --> 57:04.837
- Let's go.
- No.

57:05.589 --> 57:07.089
This is more important.

57:07.174 --> 57:11.260
- It's the uplink to the network satellite.
- But he's going to find us.

57:11.345 --> 57:13.304
Weiss, come on. Weiss.

57:20.020 --> 57:21.437
Over there.

57:33.909 --> 57:35.993
Who loves you and who do you love?

57:37.371 --> 57:38.704
Let me hear it.

57:38.789 --> 57:40.122
You've got it.

57:43.669 --> 57:45.795
Who loves you and who do you love?

57:45.879 --> 57:46.879
Let me hear it.

57:47.756 --> 57:48.756
One more time.

58:03.814 --> 58:05.064
Laughlin!

58:06.733 --> 58:08.651
Hang on, I've got you.

58:08.819 --> 58:11.654
Run. Get out of there. Get out of there!

58:22.916 --> 58:24.583
Laughlin, get up.

58:32.759 --> 58:34.343
Go, go, go.

59:09.379 --> 59:12.631
- Here you go, Leon.
- Wow, yeah.

59:12.716 --> 59:14.592
The Running Man home game.

59:38.450 --> 59:40.493
It's okay. It's okay, man.

59:40.577 --> 59:41.911
- Don't worry, don't worry.
- Don't worry.

59:41.995 --> 59:44.330
- You make more money.
- You make more money.

59:48.168 --> 59:51.337
Let's get out of here, Weiss.
He's gonna find us.

59:53.507 --> 59:56.509
- Jackpot.
- What are you doing? Weiss?

59:57.886 --> 59:59.595
What are you doing?

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:04.433
- What's this, Weiss?
- It's the uplink interface. Look out.

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:09.897
Great, hexagonal decode system.

01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:12.525
Not impossible,
it's just gonna take a little time.

01:00:15.153 --> 01:00:17.238
- Your name is Amber, right?
- Yeah.

01:00:17.322 --> 01:00:20.116
Okay, Amber, I'm going to need you
to remember these numbers.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.992
We've got to get them to Mic,
and the resistance.

01:00:22.077 --> 01:00:25.371
All right, all right, I will. But then, let's go.

01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:48.537
Richards! I love this saw.

01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:51.081
This saw's part of me.

01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:53.792
And I'm gonna make it part of you!

01:02:15.649 --> 01:02:17.358
That's all right.

01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:19.735
Keep it.

01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:30.496
God.

01:02:42.008 --> 01:02:43.300
18-24.

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:46.345
Come on.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.266
- 18-24.
- 61-B.

01:02:51.643 --> 01:02:52.935
Say them.

01:02:53.311 --> 01:02:55.771
- Say them.
- 18-24-61-B.

01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:57.273
- Can we go now?
- Not yet.

01:02:57.357 --> 01:03:01.610
- Not yet? What do you mean, not yet?
- 17-17.

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:08.576
- 4.
- 17-7-4.

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:12.204
- 17-17-4.
- Why...

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:15.124
- Come to me, my love.
- Oh, my God.

01:03:16.376 --> 01:03:17.585
No!

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:47.865
Let me go! Richards!

01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:50.534
Hey, light-head!

01:03:50.952 --> 01:03:53.245
- Hey, Christmas tree!
- Richards.

01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:13.265
Shit!

01:04:18.438 --> 01:04:20.272
All right, all right.

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:27.446
Follow me, light bulb.

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:31.867
Got you!

01:04:48.009 --> 01:04:49.218
Come on!

01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:50.636
All right, all right.

01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:11.824
Oh, God. I'm stuck.

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:15.035
Somebody help me!

01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:19.748
God. Cut, go to commercial. Jesus Christ!

01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:23.544
I have no power! Cut! Go to commercial!

01:05:29.676 --> 01:05:30.926
Kill him!

01:05:36.433 --> 01:05:39.226
No. I won't kill a helpless human being,

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:42.521
not even sadistic scum like you.

01:05:43.565 --> 01:05:45.524
Oh, my God.

01:05:46.985 --> 01:05:48.235
Come on.

01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:49.820
Do it.

01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:58.412
- What happened to Buzzsaw?
- He had to split.

01:05:59.873 --> 01:06:02.541
Hey, what an incredible battle!

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:06.628
Buzzsaw gone, Dynamo down,

01:06:06.713 --> 01:06:11.133
but the stalk isn't over till the fat lady sings,

01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:12.968
and the very last criminal...

01:06:13.052 --> 01:06:18.140
Fireball, report to wardrobe at once.
Fireball, you are wanted in wardrobe.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:21.143
...and our halftime show.

01:06:25.064 --> 01:06:26.982
Laughlin, break's over.

01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:30.903
Come on, let's get going. Come on.

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:33.322
I'm going somewhere, but not with you.

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:36.867
Buzzsaw took care
of my traveling arrangements.

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:43.582
Oh, my God.

01:06:46.586 --> 01:06:49.588
- Weiss?
- He's dead.

01:06:53.384 --> 01:06:57.095
But he gave me the code,
the satellite uplink code.

01:06:58.223 --> 01:07:01.767
The underground has a broadcast center
in quadrant four.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:05.437
Take her. Take her and the code to Mic.

01:07:06.773 --> 01:07:09.066
Don't let us die for nothing.

01:07:10.276 --> 01:07:13.445
Listen, we're counting on you.
Don't let us down.

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:20.786
I don't want to be the only asshole
in heaven, Ben.

01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:38.762
He saved my life.

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:42.724
It should be me down there.

01:07:43.351 --> 01:07:45.352
We got them? Hey, Ben.

01:07:46.145 --> 01:07:48.522
Ben, I got to hand it to you, pal.

01:07:49.107 --> 01:07:51.900
You got the whole network here
in an uproar.

01:07:51.985 --> 01:07:56.488
Why, they're shipping bicarb
to the Justice Department in crates.

01:07:56.781 --> 01:08:00.200
So that's why this little call
is just between you and I.

01:08:00.285 --> 01:08:01.952
It's not going out on the air.

01:08:02.036 --> 01:08:03.745
Listen very carefully, Ben.

01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:08.000
How would you like
a three-year contract, guaranteed,

01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:12.337
a Cadre credit line,
and a beachfront condo?

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:13.589
Sound impossible?

01:08:13.673 --> 01:08:17.466
Ben, that's the standard deal
for a network stalker.

01:08:17.551 --> 01:08:20.345
And I know real talent when I see it, Ben.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:23.724
And I'd just hate to see you
get canceled tonight

01:08:23.808 --> 01:08:25.559
when you could go the distance.

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:29.897
Say the word, Ben, and you could be
the one doing the stalking.

01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:31.356
What do you think?

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:39.113
You cold-blooded bastard!
I'll tell you what I think of it!

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:41.325
I'll live to see you eat that contract.

01:08:41.408 --> 01:08:43.160
But I hope you leave enough room
for my fist,

01:08:43.243 --> 01:08:45.162
because I'm going to ram it
into your stomach

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:47.538
and break your goddamn spine!

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:57.591
Damon, it's for you.

01:08:57.675 --> 01:08:59.760
- Who?
- It's the Attorney General.

01:09:02.055 --> 01:09:05.390
Get out. Everybody out. Come on. Move.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:11.563
Yes?

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:16.234
Fireball! Fireball! Fireball! Fireball!

01:09:18.363 --> 01:09:19.488
Fireball!

01:09:23.242 --> 01:09:24.826
Come on, Fireball!

01:09:48.267 --> 01:09:50.394
Let's go!

01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:02.948
Yeah! He's my hero. He's my hero.

01:10:28.933 --> 01:10:34.271
And there he goes. Fireball's on his way.
And Dynamo's down, but not out.

01:10:34.355 --> 01:10:37.399
- Back to you, Damon.
- Hey! All right, Agnes.

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:41.403
Listen now, big chance for you.
Win a whole lot of prizes.

01:10:41.487 --> 01:10:44.698
You know we've still got
two crack stalkers out there, right?

01:10:44.782 --> 01:10:48.660
Dynamo and Fireball.
Who do you think will make the next kill?

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:51.621
Oh, boy, that's a tough one.

01:10:51.873 --> 01:10:53.582
Come on, give it a try. You can do it.

01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:55.834
- Who do you think?
- Okay.

01:10:56.294 --> 01:11:00.172
I think the next kill will be made by

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:02.090
Ben Richards.

01:11:02.175 --> 01:11:04.301
- You can't do that.
- Hold it, hold it.

01:11:04.385 --> 01:11:09.389
Agnes, Richards is a runner.
You've got to pick a stalker.

01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:11.767
I can pick anyone I choose,

01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:13.351
and I choose

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:16.063
- Ben Richards.
- Richards?

01:11:16.147 --> 01:11:18.565
That boy's one mean motherfucker.

01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:25.781
$200 on Richards.
Come on, 200 on Richards.

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:29.868
$200 on Richards. Come on, you got it.

01:11:30.495 --> 01:11:32.704
- Let's do it?
- Yeah, just do it, just do it.

01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:33.830
Okay, okay.

01:11:33.915 --> 01:11:36.083
- Okay, man, you want it, you got it.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:11:36.167 --> 01:11:37.751
All right, Richards!

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:42.798
Place your bets. Place your bets.
Two-five, two-five.

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:47.803
Secret broadcast center, my ass.

01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:49.638
I don't know
what Laughlin was talking about.

01:11:49.722 --> 01:11:51.306
There's nothing out here.

01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:55.143
Me and my big mouth.
We should have taken the trip to Hawaii.

01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:57.896
I had the shirt for it, but you fucked it up.

01:11:58.898 --> 01:12:01.733
- Jesus Christ.
- Guess again.

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:23.588
- Come on, keep up.
- I'm running too fast. My feet can't keep up.

01:12:24.924 --> 01:12:28.343
There we go. The number one rusher.

01:12:28.427 --> 01:12:32.931
He smells blood,
and nothing on Earth is gonna stop him.

01:12:41.732 --> 01:12:42.941
This way.

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:44.359
Why here? No, I want to go that way.

01:12:44.443 --> 01:12:46.528
- I think that... Let go.
- Let's go.

01:12:49.949 --> 01:12:52.075
You're gonna get us killed.

01:12:55.746 --> 01:12:57.038
Stop it!

01:12:58.082 --> 01:13:00.876
Richards! Let me go!

01:13:03.963 --> 01:13:05.338
Burn them. Good.

01:13:31.032 --> 01:13:32.991
Amber, get out of here.

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:36.161
Go!

01:13:38.039 --> 01:13:39.331
Move!

01:14:07.693 --> 01:14:08.860
Amber?

01:14:17.161 --> 01:14:18.495
Richards?

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:31.466
Richards?

01:14:42.687 --> 01:14:43.770
Richards?

01:15:13.467 --> 01:15:14.759
Whitman.

01:15:26.897 --> 01:15:28.106
Price.

01:15:32.778 --> 01:15:33.987
Haddad.

01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:43.705
They're Running Men.

01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:46.333
Last season's winners.

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:50.754
No, last season's losers.

01:16:10.274 --> 01:16:12.650
My gas line! My gas line!

01:16:12.769 --> 01:16:14.350
Cut to the commercials!

01:16:14.362 --> 01:16:16.071
How about a light?

01:16:32.296 --> 01:16:33.963
What a hothead.

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:40.553
- Yeah, Richards!
- Get him, Richards.

01:16:41.055 --> 01:16:42.389
Captain Freedom to wardrobe.

01:16:42.473 --> 01:16:44.474
Captain Freedom to wardrobe,
on the double.

01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:04.828
Forget it, Killian! I won't do it.

01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:07.705
It's not a request, moron. It's an order.

01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:09.707
I don't need this crap!

01:17:10.543 --> 01:17:12.961
This stuff is garbage!

01:17:18.134 --> 01:17:22.053
I was killing guys like this 10 years ago
with my bare hands!

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:26.891
I'm not going for any of these tricks!
This is a sport of death and honor!

01:17:26.976 --> 01:17:28.476
Code of the gladiators!

01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:31.563
Cap, will you spare me
the combat Zen speech?

01:17:31.647 --> 01:17:36.109
What the hell's the matter with you?
Can't you see what's going on out there?

01:17:36.193 --> 01:17:39.946
This isn't a game!
They're betting on Richards up there!

01:17:40.239 --> 01:17:43.241
- Bullshit!
- Get out of here.

01:17:44.827 --> 01:17:46.578
Get him out of here!

01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:50.331
What's the matter, steroids make you deaf?

01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:52.417
Get him out of here, now!

01:18:06.182 --> 01:18:07.348
Now what?

01:18:07.433 --> 01:18:10.101
Now let's find Mic's secret broadcast center,

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:12.395
if it even exists.

01:18:13.272 --> 01:18:14.439
Shit!

01:18:16.901 --> 01:18:18.568
Let's try that way.

01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:26.242
We're trapped.

01:18:26.619 --> 01:18:30.580
Subzero, Fireball

01:18:30.664 --> 01:18:32.290
and Buzzsaw.

01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:36.711
Say their names with reverent pride.

01:18:36.795 --> 01:18:40.215
They punished crime and served the law.

01:18:40.299 --> 01:18:42.884
As patriots, they died.

01:18:45.012 --> 01:18:47.722
This is what I hate. Third-act problems.

01:18:47.806 --> 01:18:49.933
Roll stock.

01:18:50.518 --> 01:18:52.810
Freeze in digital memory.

01:18:53.812 --> 01:18:57.190
- And...
- Activate traveling matte.

01:18:58.651 --> 01:19:02.737
Tony, this better work, pal,
or you'll be a digital memory.

01:19:02.821 --> 01:19:03.905
Take it easy, Damon.

01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:05.740
We're loading Richards' image
onto the database,

01:19:05.824 --> 01:19:07.659
and when he's mapped
onto the stunt double,

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:10.537
you'll never know the difference.

01:19:10.621 --> 01:19:13.206
All right, boys. Let's see you dance.

01:19:16.377 --> 01:19:19.045
Sensational. I love it!

01:19:22.508 --> 01:19:26.010
Mr. Richards, I'm surprised
you were so easily caught.

01:19:30.307 --> 01:19:34.018
Welcome to the people's network.
We've been waiting for you.

01:19:35.312 --> 01:19:36.729
This is nice, Mic.

01:19:36.814 --> 01:19:39.190
But it would have been nicer
if you would have gotten off your asses

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:41.734
- and helped us out there.
- We couldn't.

01:19:41.819 --> 01:19:45.071
We'd have been seen, and the government
would have found this place.

01:19:45.155 --> 01:19:47.865
Laughlin, Weiss,
would have died for nothing.

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:49.367
They didn't.

01:19:50.703 --> 01:19:52.328
I have the uplink code.

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:54.455
Ladies and gentleman,

01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:58.042
I've just got an update
on tonight's incredible action.

01:19:58.669 --> 01:20:01.546
The runners have entered the final quad.

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:04.799
And Captain Freedom
has hung up his announcer's mike

01:20:04.883 --> 01:20:06.342
and come out of retirement.

01:20:06.427 --> 01:20:09.596
He's suited up
and ready for the final conflict.

01:20:09.930 --> 01:20:12.473
Let's go now, live to the game zone.

01:21:36.975 --> 01:21:42.605
Yes, it's all over! What a colossal fight!
This is an incredible moment in sports.

01:21:42.690 --> 01:21:46.234
Captain Freedom out of retirement
and still undefeated champion.

01:21:46.318 --> 01:21:50.279
Proving once again that right and might
are one and the same.

01:21:53.951 --> 01:21:55.660
Damn that Killian!

01:21:56.662 --> 01:21:59.539
What's wrong? You should be happy.
We're officially dead.

01:21:59.623 --> 01:22:03.042
- We can go anywhere, do anything.
- No, don't you understand it?

01:22:03.127 --> 01:22:05.670
He'll never let us out of here alive.
They can't afford it.

01:22:05.754 --> 01:22:08.589
They'll get the police, the army,
and hunt us down like dogs,

01:22:08.674 --> 01:22:10.508
off-camera, of course.

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:15.012
Okay. Dismantle all the overlays.

01:22:15.139 --> 01:22:18.307
Put the digital matte
in the pixel memory storage.

01:22:18.392 --> 01:22:20.143
You know, the damn thing
worked like a charm.

01:22:20.227 --> 01:22:24.188
It should. Editel charged us
an arm and a leg for the software.

01:22:24.773 --> 01:22:27.650
Damon, you didn't have to kill him.

01:22:28.235 --> 01:22:33.489
It's all a part of life's rich pattern, Brenda,
and you better fucking get used to it.

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:37.285
That's the one for the awards show, huh?
Thank you. You're doing nice work.

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:38.536
I thank you.

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.913
Tony, you're finally getting it.

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:45.418
Guns. You don't need guns
to jam a satellite.

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:47.170
I do, to keep it.

01:22:47.254 --> 01:22:48.671
The minute I steal the signal,

01:22:48.756 --> 01:22:51.924
the network will try to shunt
the next one in orbit.

01:22:52.009 --> 01:22:54.469
Stevie's group is going inside
to stop them now.

01:22:54.553 --> 01:22:55.970
These kids?

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:58.639
That's a bad move, Mic.

01:22:58.849 --> 01:23:01.768
They need a leader.
They need someone with experience.

01:23:01.852 --> 01:23:04.562
I thought you were looking for the door.

01:23:07.232 --> 01:23:09.400
I told Killian I'd be back.

01:23:10.903 --> 01:23:12.945
I wouldn't want to be a liar.

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.906
Listen up, everybody.

01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:19.744
I want you to all to consider yourselves
picked up for the rest of the season, okay?

01:23:21.246 --> 01:23:25.708
What are you, my people or an oil painting?
We're up nine points!

01:23:25.793 --> 01:23:28.044
Come on, now. Let's go, champ.

01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:34.175
We're going to send the uplink code
in 20 minutes.

01:23:34.259 --> 01:23:36.928
Ten seconds later, I'll go on the air.

01:23:38.096 --> 01:23:39.972
- We'll be ready.
- If you want to make an impression,

01:23:40.057 --> 01:23:43.267
forget the speech. Try this instead.

01:23:44.186 --> 01:23:45.478
What is it?

01:23:45.562 --> 01:23:48.606
It's the original video
from the Bakersfield massacre,

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:50.942
before they edited for broadcasting.

01:24:02.621 --> 01:24:04.580
Where did you hide that?

01:24:05.999 --> 01:24:07.667
It's none of your business.

01:24:20.264 --> 01:24:22.014
Hey, what the hell?

01:24:36.488 --> 01:24:39.699
- Six minutes.
- Begin satellite coding sequence.

01:24:40.158 --> 01:24:42.910
Load uplink code into transponder grid.

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:47.957
Shunt power to main circuits.
Mr. Spock, you have the com.

01:24:49.793 --> 01:24:51.419
Who's Mr. Spock?

01:25:07.769 --> 01:25:09.979
Come on, let me hear it now.

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:12.148
Yeah.

01:25:13.191 --> 01:25:16.694
Welcome to the post-game wrap-up show.

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:18.529
Ladies, I love you.

01:25:19.698 --> 01:25:21.699
Thank you, young man.

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:24.952
- Hello. You're on the air.
- Hi, Damon. My name is Wendy.

01:25:25.037 --> 01:25:28.539
Listen, I have a question about Dynamo.
Is he seriously hurt or what?

01:25:28.624 --> 01:25:31.626
He's gonna be fine, love. Fortunately, see...

01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:34.754
- Good luck.
...Dynamo is still under factory warranty.

01:25:34.838 --> 01:25:36.297
You, too.

01:25:36.381 --> 01:25:37.340
You're on the air.

01:25:37.424 --> 01:25:39.967
Damon, I feel so bad
about the dead stalkers.

01:25:40.052 --> 01:25:43.262
Is there any way I can make a donation
to help out their families?

01:25:43.347 --> 01:25:45.681
What a darling you are. Yes, my doll.

01:25:45.766 --> 01:25:50.186
All you do, you send your checks
to the patriots fund, care of this station.

01:25:50.729 --> 01:25:55.900
Three, two, one, that's it.

01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:58.069
We got it! We got that baby!

01:25:58.153 --> 01:26:00.863
Those contributions are tax deductible.

01:26:02.366 --> 01:26:05.534
And who loves you and who do you love?

01:26:05.744 --> 01:26:07.203
Damon!

01:26:07.287 --> 01:26:09.497
Yes. Yes. Yes.

01:26:11.667 --> 01:26:13.501
Hey, what's going on?

01:26:13.752 --> 01:26:15.670
We don't lie.

01:26:15.754 --> 01:26:20.007
...like our previous winners,
Whitman, Price and Haddad.

01:26:20.092 --> 01:26:23.678
You remember them.
There they are and at this very moment

01:26:23.762 --> 01:26:26.305
basking under the Maui sun,

01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:29.350
their debt to society paid in full.

01:26:29.434 --> 01:26:32.061
Watch that screen.

01:26:32.604 --> 01:26:35.064
Yankee-nine-niner,
what's the status of the crowd?

01:26:35.148 --> 01:26:39.568
Food riot in progress.
Approximately 1,500 civilians.

01:26:40.278 --> 01:26:41.696
No weapons are evident.

01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:44.991
Proceed with Plan Alpha.
Eliminate anything moving.

01:26:45.075 --> 01:26:46.742
I said the crowd is unarmed.

01:26:46.827 --> 01:26:48.869
There are lots of women
and children down there.

01:26:48.954 --> 01:26:50.788
All they want is some food, for God's sake!

01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:53.124
As you were, Richards.
Proceed with Plan Alpha.

01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:56.210
- All rioters must be eliminated.
- The hell with you.

01:26:56.294 --> 01:26:58.838
- I will not fire at helpless human beings.
- You have your orders...

01:26:58.922 --> 01:27:02.049
- Where's it coming from?
- The network satellite.

01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:05.803
Abort mission. Return to base.

01:27:06.304 --> 01:27:08.180
Don't touch that dial.

01:27:08.432 --> 01:27:11.142
Detain Richards and proceed as ordered.

01:27:11.351 --> 01:27:14.020
Richards, what the fuck are you doing?

01:27:18.942 --> 01:27:20.192
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:27:20.277 --> 01:27:23.320
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you'll please bear with us,

01:27:23.405 --> 01:27:27.241
- we're experiencing technical difficulties.
- Bullshit!

01:27:33.874 --> 01:27:35.207
It's show time.

01:27:50.557 --> 01:27:53.476
Get the people out.
Come on, get the people out.

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:09.950
Thought it was pretty funny
out there in the zone?

01:28:10.035 --> 01:28:14.497
What's the matter now, bitch?
Why aren't you laughing?

01:28:14.873 --> 01:28:16.165
Because there's nothing funny

01:28:16.249 --> 01:28:19.543
about a dickless moron
with a battery up his ass.

01:28:31.556 --> 01:28:32.848
Out, out.

01:28:38.647 --> 01:28:40.564
I'll show you dickless.

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:24.275
- Get out of my way!
- Get down! Down!

01:29:30.615 --> 01:29:31.782
Let's go!

01:30:06.443 --> 01:30:08.110
Hello, cutie pie.

01:30:11.448 --> 01:30:13.991
One of us is in deep trouble.

01:30:30.842 --> 01:30:34.637
Sven, do you wanna talk to Mr. Richards?

01:30:41.519 --> 01:30:42.603
Well?

01:30:46.358 --> 01:30:48.609
I got to score some steroids.

01:30:56.326 --> 01:30:58.118
You look pissed, Ben.

01:31:02.707 --> 01:31:05.000
Believe me, you got every right to be.

01:31:05.085 --> 01:31:08.003
But, hey, will you just let me explain?

01:31:08.088 --> 01:31:10.464
This is television, that's all it is.

01:31:10.548 --> 01:31:13.384
It's nothing to do with people.
It's to do with the ratings.

01:31:14.094 --> 01:31:19.014
For 50 years, we've told them what to eat,
what to drink, what to wear.

01:31:19.099 --> 01:31:21.475
For Christ's sake,
Ben, don't you understand?

01:31:21.559 --> 01:31:25.729
Americans love television.
They wean their kids on it.

01:31:26.147 --> 01:31:29.149
Listen, they love game shows,
they love wrestling,

01:31:29.234 --> 01:31:31.610
they love sports and violence.

01:31:32.195 --> 01:31:33.821
So what do we do?

01:31:34.281 --> 01:31:36.532
We give them what they want.

01:31:37.575 --> 01:31:40.619
We're number one, Ben.
That's all that counts.

01:31:40.829 --> 01:31:43.914
Believe me,
I've been in the business 30 years.

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:47.543
Well, I haven't been in show business
as long as you have, Killian,

01:31:47.627 --> 01:31:49.586
but I'm a quick learner.

01:31:49.671 --> 01:31:52.840
So, I'm going to give the audience
what I think they want.

01:31:52.924 --> 01:31:53.924
Wait.

01:31:58.513 --> 01:32:01.432
You bastard. Drop dead!

01:32:02.434 --> 01:32:04.226
I don't do requests.

01:32:10.275 --> 01:32:12.901
No!

01:32:56.529 --> 01:32:57.988
Well, that hit the spot.

01:33:05.997 --> 01:33:07.748
Yeah! All right, yeah!

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:13.796
Take him out!

01:33:18.593 --> 01:33:24.640
Richards! Richards! Richards!
Richards! Richards! Richards!

01:39:11.946 --> 01:39:14.990
The Running Man
has been brought to you by

01:39:15.074 --> 01:39:20.078
Breakaway paramilitary uniforms,
Orthopure procreation pills

01:39:20.163 --> 01:39:23.749
and Cadre Cola. It hits the spot!

01:39:23.833 --> 01:39:27.502
Promotional considerations
paid for by Kelton flamethrowers,

01:39:27.587 --> 01:39:32.174
Wainwright electrical launchers,
and Hammond and Gage chainsaws.

01:39:32.258 --> 01:39:34.926
Damon Killian's wardrobe by Chez Antoine,

01:39:35.011 --> 01:39:39.014
19th-century craftsmanship
for the 21st-century man.

01:39:39.098 --> 01:39:41.183
Cadre trooper and studio guard sidearms

01:39:41.267 --> 01:39:44.978
provided by Colchester,
the pistol of patriots.

01:39:45.062 --> 01:39:48.648
Remember, tickets for the ICS studio tour
are always available

01:39:48.733 --> 01:39:51.568
for Class A citizens in good standing.

01:39:51.652 --> 01:39:54.488
If you'd like to be a contestant
on The Running Man,

01:39:54.572 --> 01:39:58.325
send a self-addressed, stamped envelope
to "ICS Talent Hunt,"

01:39:58.409 --> 01:39:59.659
care of your local affiliate,

01:39:59.744 --> 01:40:03.079
and then go out
and do something really despicable.

01:40:03.164 --> 01:40:06.750
I'm Phil Hilton. Good night, and take care.
