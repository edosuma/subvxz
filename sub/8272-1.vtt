00:28.419 --> 00:30.680
<i>I can feel him watching me.</i>

00:31.915 --> 00:34.200
<i>He's been after me for years.</i>

00:37.703 --> 00:39.889
<i>Ever since I was a boy.</i>

00:41.407 --> 00:43.475
First he took Mom and Dad.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.137
Then he took Jody.

00:47.322 --> 00:49.323
Now he's after me.

00:49.423 --> 00:53.152
Mike, that Tall Man of yours
did not take Jody away.

00:53.252 --> 00:55.514
Jody died in a car wreck.

01:06.808 --> 01:09.310
<i>Reggie told me that it was all a dream.</i>

01:11.171 --> 01:14.058
<i>And I was beginning to think
that maybe he was right.</i>

01:23.512 --> 01:25.415
Boy!

01:37.473 --> 01:39.517
<i>Reggie saved me that time.</i>

01:40.501 --> 01:42.712
<i>And we've been on the run ever since.</i>

02:26.765 --> 02:29.233
<i>But somehow, he keeps coming back.</i>

02:42.406 --> 02:45.002
<i>And just when we think we've destroyed him...</i>

02:47.236 --> 02:50.851
<i>we must remember, we can never
trust the things that we see.</i>

02:57.446 --> 03:01.458
<i>Because nothing is ever as it seems.</i>

03:40.631 --> 03:42.242
Reg!

03:45.286 --> 03:46.930
Reg?

04:20.805 --> 04:22.190
Hey!

04:24.357 --> 04:26.170
Oh, shit.

04:42.945 --> 04:45.284
Mike. Come on, Mike, wake up.

05:05.834 --> 05:07.670
Oh, shit.

05:08.705 --> 05:11.857
Mike, come on, we gotta get out of here.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.258
Come on.

05:19.132 --> 05:21.141
Goddamn it!

05:30.227 --> 05:33.814
Come on, buddy. Come on, Mike,
put your arms around me.

05:34.314 --> 05:36.158
Come on, buddy.

05:42.998 --> 05:44.841
Come on.

06:05.820 --> 06:09.649
Eight seconds to hell, goddamn you!

06:11.411 --> 06:14.475
I don't want him in pieces.

06:14.575 --> 06:17.166
It's the only way you're gonna get him.

06:23.264 --> 06:26.309
Then I'll wait.

06:28.716 --> 06:32.647
Take good care of him.

07:03.124 --> 07:04.842
Still no change.

08:15.937 --> 08:18.621
It's all right, it's natural.

08:19.521 --> 08:21.249
Just relax.

08:21.350 --> 08:24.504
You see the light now up ahead, don't you?

08:25.045 --> 08:27.133
Go to it.

08:27.665 --> 08:30.735
<i>Go to the warmth of the light.</i>

08:39.210 --> 08:42.958
- Jody?
- Yeah. It's me, little brother.

08:45.475 --> 08:49.640
Don't be afraid. I'm here to take care
of you and show you the way.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.119
Mike, I want you to go back.

08:55.219 --> 08:57.646
You're not with these others.

09:02.618 --> 09:04.670
Stay away from the light.

09:09.008 --> 09:11.076
Come back, Mike.

09:31.897 --> 09:34.061
Boy!

10:04.851 --> 10:07.725
Hi. Everything okay?

11:14.626 --> 11:17.538
Come on, buddy.
We gotta get the hell out of here.

11:25.021 --> 11:27.749
All I know is, once you see one
of those chrome brain drains,

11:27.891 --> 11:29.819
the Tall Man is not far behind.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.610
<i>Mike...</i>

11:40.695 --> 11:42.536
Stop the car!

11:51.422 --> 11:53.691
It was Jody, I saw him.

11:55.051 --> 11:57.921
Your brother's been dead for ten years, Mike.

11:58.021 --> 12:01.468
Come on, Mike, we don't have time
for this. Come on, let's go.

12:15.423 --> 12:17.467
We gotta get out of here.

12:22.036 --> 12:24.090
Goddamn it!

12:29.303 --> 12:31.856
Be careful, they could be anywhere.

12:31.956 --> 12:35.100
Come on, there's more gear
in the house. I'll go first.

12:47.020 --> 12:48.664
Jody!

12:49.298 --> 12:53.807
Jody, what the hell
are you doing here? You're dead!

12:54.569 --> 12:56.613
So, what else is new?

12:59.417 --> 13:01.952
- No, you can't touch me.
- Why not?

13:02.169 --> 13:05.269
I haven't got the juice to stay long
and you've gotta get out of here fast.

13:05.369 --> 13:09.289
- What are you talking about? Why?
- I don't want you to wind up like me.

13:18.028 --> 13:20.055
What the hell?

13:20.697 --> 13:23.947
I'm sorry, Mike.
I knew he might lock onto me.

13:29.322 --> 13:32.615
Shit. It's one of those things.

13:40.265 --> 13:43.620
- <i>It's me, Mike.</i>
- Jody, what the hell happened to you?

13:43.720 --> 13:46.784
- <i>I'm in here, Mike.</i>
- Mike, get back, I can get a shot.

13:47.064 --> 13:51.531
- In where?
- Mike, who the hell are you talking to?

13:51.895 --> 13:54.324
Can't you hear? It's Jody, he's in the ball.

13:54.424 --> 13:56.366
He's talking to me.

13:56.466 --> 13:58.873
Yeah, right, Mike.

13:59.095 --> 14:02.088
<i>Little brother,
he's coming for you right now.</i>

14:02.188 --> 14:04.794
<i>I can't stop him,
but maybe I can slow him down.</i>

14:09.335 --> 14:11.607
<i>Mike, stay behind me.</i>

14:17.387 --> 14:19.790
It's time now, boy.

14:44.314 --> 14:45.900
Why?

14:46.000 --> 14:49.266
Why do you want me? Why?

15:48.423 --> 15:51.347
Well, Jody, I guess
even you couldn't stop him.

15:53.485 --> 15:54.707
<i>Holtsville.</i>

15:55.713 --> 15:57.557
Holtsville?

15:57.849 --> 15:59.692
What did you say?

16:00.234 --> 16:01.925
Jody.

16:02.664 --> 16:04.672
Did you say something?

16:10.703 --> 16:13.289
Hell, now I'm talking to this damned thing.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.762
Sure fucked up my hallway.

17:05.366 --> 17:08.021
What's up Highway 32 here? Holtsville?

17:08.453 --> 17:11.707
- You don't wanna be going up there.
- Why not?

17:11.808 --> 17:13.944
Toxic spill, a couple of years back.

17:15.792 --> 17:18.296
That'll be 22 bucks.

17:18.396 --> 17:20.207
Oh, yeah.

17:21.398 --> 17:24.236
- There you go. Thanks a lot.
- Yeah.

19:10.869 --> 19:12.957
What are you doing here?

19:15.466 --> 19:17.471
Are you talking to me?

19:19.353 --> 19:21.722
Well, I don't see anybody else around here.

19:22.364 --> 19:26.502
Well, I'm just helping myself. These folks
left all their stuff. Can you believe that?

19:27.437 --> 19:29.681
Lord above!

19:30.423 --> 19:32.667
Why, look what I just found.

19:34.836 --> 19:37.643
- Do you think it's loaded?
- Hey!

19:42.376 --> 19:44.746
Ooh, that was fun.

19:44.846 --> 19:49.417
Let me have it. Give me the gun.
Give me the goddamn gun.

19:53.421 --> 19:55.307
Thank you.

20:04.190 --> 20:07.594
- What are we gonna do with him?
- Take him outside of town.

20:07.694 --> 20:10.715
Yeah, good. Then what?

20:12.091 --> 20:15.243
Gut him and put him in the ground.

20:18.471 --> 20:20.700
Got any gold teeth there, fella?

20:21.834 --> 20:25.045
Let's stick him
in the back of that muscle car.

20:36.457 --> 20:38.300
I'm driving.

21:17.397 --> 21:21.169
Boy, oh, boy. Today is my lucky day.

21:26.306 --> 21:28.909
I bet there's lots of good stuff in there.

21:29.009 --> 21:32.752
You two go ahead to the front
and I'll take the back.

22:04.529 --> 22:06.764
Just a couple of old folks, that's all.

22:21.730 --> 22:23.674
Must be deaf.

22:33.959 --> 22:36.580
<i>You're in trouble! You're in trouble!</i>

22:38.013 --> 22:39.656
Rufus.

23:13.107 --> 23:15.351
Christ, it's just a kid.

23:15.760 --> 23:17.433
Well, he ain't never gonna grow up.

23:17.533 --> 23:22.231
I got me a little rug rat here.
The boy's a little fighter. I like that.

23:22.331 --> 23:24.319
Don't hurt him yet, Henry.

23:24.419 --> 23:26.822
Let's have a little fun with him first.

23:33.637 --> 23:35.036
Stop, boy!

23:46.746 --> 23:48.978
No!

23:50.562 --> 23:53.565
Rufus, we gotta kiss it. Come on.

24:02.557 --> 24:05.528
Stop! Or I'll throw this.

24:05.628 --> 24:08.033
You think we're playing games, kid?

24:08.931 --> 24:10.963
This is for real.

24:11.275 --> 24:13.285
So is this.

24:43.425 --> 24:47.316
Goddamn it, now you've done it,
you little bastard.

24:49.514 --> 24:52.808
- Hold still, you little fuck.
- Okay.

25:03.395 --> 25:07.365
Just you wait till I get up
out of here, you son of a bitch.

25:20.354 --> 25:22.231
What's going on out there?

25:22.331 --> 25:26.426
Hey! Hey! What's going on out there?

25:27.661 --> 25:31.766
Hey, hey, what's going on?
Somebody let me out of here!

25:31.866 --> 25:33.788
Who are you?

25:33.888 --> 25:37.263
I own this car. Come on, let me out of here.

25:37.363 --> 25:39.874
How do I know you're not one of them?

25:39.974 --> 25:43.237
'Cause I'm in here, goddamn it.

26:17.379 --> 26:20.023
Thanks. I owe you one.

26:28.474 --> 26:30.517
These others your family?

26:32.444 --> 26:35.822
No. The Tall Man got my family.

26:37.214 --> 26:40.126
These are just scavengers
that tried to hurt me.

26:40.226 --> 26:41.594
Yeah.

26:44.923 --> 26:46.680
Sundown.

26:46.980 --> 26:49.027
We'd better get inside.

26:49.127 --> 26:52.688
What's the rush? I thought you said
the Tall Man had moved on.

26:53.081 --> 26:57.010
Yeah. But he left these... things.

27:00.046 --> 27:03.305
I call them Lurkers.
They only come out at night.

27:05.794 --> 27:07.155
Come on.

27:23.638 --> 27:26.408
I've been on my own since my parents died.

27:27.258 --> 27:29.352
Yeah, it must've been rough.

27:30.236 --> 27:31.958
Yeah.

27:34.449 --> 27:36.492
My father was the sheriff.

27:39.244 --> 27:41.506
<i>He was one of the first ones taken.</i>

27:45.176 --> 27:48.101
<i>He'd gone to meet the new owners
of the cemetery.</i>

27:48.855 --> 27:51.266
<i>They found him the next morning in a ditch.</i>

27:52.558 --> 27:54.643
<i>Said it was a heart attack.</i>

28:00.801 --> 28:04.850
<i>Then they didn't cover him up
right away. So I waited.</i>

28:05.330 --> 28:07.173
<i>And I waited.</i>

28:12.478 --> 28:14.656
They forgot to cover him up.

28:14.756 --> 28:18.447
It's just a mistake, honey.
I'm sure they'll do it tomorrow.

28:18.990 --> 28:20.727
Come on.

28:21.112 --> 28:24.841
<i>My mom was too upset to understand
what was really going on.</i>

28:25.584 --> 28:28.069
<i>I knew someone had murdered my father.</i>

28:29.154 --> 28:31.724
<i>Then we came face to face with the truth.</i>

28:51.093 --> 28:53.705
Stay here, Timmy. Don't move.

30:00.347 --> 30:02.934
<i>The town went quietly after that.</i>

30:04.118 --> 30:06.279
<i>And I've been here ever since.</i>

30:06.379 --> 30:08.063
Alone?

30:08.997 --> 30:10.616
Yeah.

30:12.084 --> 30:13.686
Wow.

30:47.112 --> 30:52.420
I couldn't reach the pedals that first year
but now I can. And I've been practicing.

30:52.520 --> 30:55.691
- Practicing what?
- Driving. I'm getting pretty good.

30:55.791 --> 30:58.623
I was thinking maybe later
I could take your Hemi for a spin.

30:58.723 --> 31:02.511
No way. I've been restoring
that car for two years.

31:04.095 --> 31:05.939
Goddamn it.

31:10.034 --> 31:11.889
Where the hell is that pink hearse?

31:14.422 --> 31:16.891
Uh, Reg?

31:19.919 --> 31:22.023
There's something else missing.

31:22.996 --> 31:24.875
The Lurkers got 'em.

31:24.975 --> 31:26.619
Shit!

31:30.706 --> 31:35.119
Okay, I'm gonna be moving on now.
I can drop you at the next town.

31:35.261 --> 31:39.048
Well, I was thinking
maybe I could tag along for a while.

31:39.148 --> 31:41.917
Tim, you don't wanna go where I'm going.

31:42.017 --> 31:44.286
Hell, I don't wanna go there either.

31:45.654 --> 31:47.773
Two's better than one.

31:47.873 --> 31:49.717
I can help.

31:56.357 --> 31:57.737
See?

31:57.837 --> 32:00.508
A little kid shouldn't be playing with guns.

32:01.045 --> 32:03.289
I ain't a kid no more, Reg.

32:23.101 --> 32:25.145
Hey, what's this?

32:25.929 --> 32:28.881
Uh, it's one of those balls
I was telling you about.

32:29.023 --> 32:32.525
It came over to our side
and got cooked in the process somehow.

33:09.766 --> 33:12.050
I gotta get some directions here.

33:12.150 --> 33:14.821
Why don't you get out and stretch your legs?

33:15.343 --> 33:17.006
Okay.

33:27.349 --> 33:29.118
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:29.218 --> 33:32.804
- All these kids yours?
- Hell, no.

33:32.904 --> 33:35.653
They're some of the orphans
that straggled down here from Holtsville.

33:35.753 --> 33:38.202
We're just trying to take care of them.

37:12.879 --> 37:15.507
Looks like we caught ourselves
a fish, girlfriend.

37:22.663 --> 37:24.607
What's his problem?

37:27.518 --> 37:30.806
We're in deep shit.
We gotta get out of here before...

37:32.898 --> 37:34.076
Oh, fuck.

37:41.616 --> 37:43.360
What the hell?

37:50.376 --> 37:51.802
Anita!

38:23.968 --> 38:25.970
Unlock these goddamn handcuffs.

38:29.332 --> 38:31.376
Don't go near that thing!

39:40.429 --> 39:42.781
What the fuck was that?

39:42.881 --> 39:45.632
That's kinda hard to explain.

39:46.234 --> 39:50.309
- And who the hell are you two?
- I'm Reggie and this...

39:50.872 --> 39:52.916
this is Tim.

39:54.326 --> 39:56.269
They call me Rocky.

39:56.954 --> 40:00.240
What the hell are you doing here, Rocky?
Is this your home town or what?

40:00.652 --> 40:03.026
It was. My whole family just vanished.

40:03.126 --> 40:05.712
And the rest of the town 86'd.

40:05.812 --> 40:07.840
This town's dead.

40:07.940 --> 40:10.936
Nothing left here but those damned sentinels.

40:12.136 --> 40:15.498
We're not hanging out here
till another one turns up.

40:15.598 --> 40:17.609
Come on, let's go.

40:18.109 --> 40:22.152
You go on ahead, but I ain't letting
no flying Christmas tree ornament

40:22.252 --> 40:25.825
back me up out of here
before I do what I got to do.

40:25.925 --> 40:28.947
Suit yourself. Lots of luck, baby.

40:39.522 --> 40:42.084
Thanks, kid. I owe you one.

40:42.992 --> 40:44.661
Two.

40:45.761 --> 40:48.899
- What?
- On my count, you owe me two.

40:50.659 --> 40:53.411
Okay. Okay, I owe you two.

40:53.761 --> 40:56.990
Hey, you gonna dump me off
at that lady's place again?

41:05.966 --> 41:07.803
Come on.

41:08.861 --> 41:10.959
We've got things to do.

41:14.592 --> 41:16.874
Hey, watch the upholstery.

41:28.513 --> 41:30.192
Yeah!

41:30.758 --> 41:33.085
Yeah! Yeah!

41:33.185 --> 41:34.560
Yee-ha!

41:34.970 --> 41:36.624
Yee-ha!

41:57.751 --> 42:01.087
Hell, I don't have a clue which way to go.

42:02.324 --> 42:04.347
Uh, Reg?

42:04.847 --> 42:06.687
Watch what it does.

42:07.387 --> 42:09.466
Which way should we go?

42:17.580 --> 42:19.348
Well, okay.

42:19.448 --> 42:23.141
But I hope that ball's got a better sense
of direction than mine do.

42:51.490 --> 42:52.934
What's up?

42:53.034 --> 42:57.088
Well, I guess you could say we're
on a search-and-destroy mission.

42:57.488 --> 43:00.132
- You two?
- Yeah.

43:00.232 --> 43:04.487
We're searching for a friend, but first
we gotta destroy the bastard who's got him.

43:04.587 --> 43:09.193
Oh, by the way, he's the guy
who wiped out your home town.

43:10.100 --> 43:11.979
Wanna come along?

43:20.486 --> 43:24.874
Picture that. The three of us
facing down the forces of evil.

43:25.374 --> 43:29.037
Yeah. Have you got something better to do?

43:37.729 --> 43:39.608
Move over.

43:43.584 --> 43:46.271
So, who's this guy we're chasing?

43:46.371 --> 43:49.724
He's a very tall man from... God knows where.

43:49.824 --> 43:53.170
- Maybe from another planet.
- From another planet?

43:53.270 --> 43:57.116
He kills people, he ships
their bodies back to... wherever.

43:57.216 --> 44:00.303
- You're pulling my leg.
- I wish I was.

44:00.593 --> 44:03.905
Well, that explains
why everyone's checked out.

44:04.005 --> 44:06.002
I've been through four towns, all deserted.

44:06.102 --> 44:09.972
Half this county's been wiped out
and nobody's figured it out yet.

44:10.072 --> 44:12.698
- So, where are we headed?
- East.

44:12.798 --> 44:15.743
And from what I can tell,
that's where he's headed.

44:19.879 --> 44:22.407
You're pretty good
with those things, aren't you?

44:22.507 --> 44:25.290
The army taught me to defend myself.

44:25.810 --> 44:29.433
These just keep people
from getting too close.

44:30.407 --> 44:32.324
What's next on the map?

44:32.424 --> 44:34.663
Just another small town.

44:35.880 --> 44:39.943
"Boulton, home
of the spring apple festival...

44:41.018 --> 44:45.990
"and the largest Gothic mausoleum
in the western US."

44:46.690 --> 44:49.110
That might be worth visiting.

45:29.143 --> 45:31.670
I... I need a room.

45:31.770 --> 45:34.632
We got them with twin beds or single queens.

45:37.367 --> 45:40.505
Uh, give me that queen.

45:42.030 --> 45:44.617
You pay 20 for that. In advance.

45:44.717 --> 45:46.339
Alright.

45:46.785 --> 45:50.654
Hey, uh, how far is it up to that next town?

45:51.082 --> 45:53.961
What is it... Boulton?

45:55.510 --> 45:59.381
What do you wanna go there for?
It's a ghost town, everybody moved out.

45:59.481 --> 46:01.344
Yeah, I'm looking for a friend.

46:02.384 --> 46:06.121
Anthrax plague a couple of years back,
wiped out the sheep farms.

46:06.221 --> 46:08.400
Gee, it was bad up there.

46:11.309 --> 46:13.879
It got some of the families too.

46:13.979 --> 46:16.195
I'd stay the hell out of there,
if I were you.

46:17.608 --> 46:21.130
Yeah, I get the picture. Thanks.

46:29.278 --> 46:31.180
Damn our luck.

46:31.280 --> 46:34.668
All they had was a single room
with a queen-size bed.

46:35.418 --> 46:38.221
You wouldn't mind sleeping
in the car tonight, would you, Tim?

46:38.621 --> 46:42.078
Sure, I don't mind.
Do you want the front or the back seat?

46:42.178 --> 46:43.843
Uh...

46:44.593 --> 46:46.881
You can have the whole car to yourself.

46:51.458 --> 46:55.965
You know, it's gonna get cold out here.
Why don't you come inside with us?

46:58.215 --> 47:01.913
- Well...
- We can make room.

47:04.707 --> 47:06.754
Well, uh...

47:06.854 --> 47:09.884
it's better in here
than on the floor in there.

47:27.371 --> 47:30.115
See the floor? You're bunking there tonight.

47:30.215 --> 47:32.485
Come on, the bed's big enough for both of us.

47:32.585 --> 47:34.588
- Shit.
- Ah, come on!

47:34.688 --> 47:36.464
All right.

47:39.925 --> 47:43.130
But, Reg, don't fuck with me.

47:58.355 --> 48:00.396
Hey, you know...

48:01.141 --> 48:03.108
I was just thinking that...

48:03.208 --> 48:06.687
- ...maybe we could...
- Get some sleep?

48:11.925 --> 48:16.289
Oh, come on, Rocky. Hey, loosen up a little.

48:17.038 --> 48:19.039
Ever try vanilla?

48:20.282 --> 48:23.788
Didn't I tell you?
Dairy products give me gas!

48:26.956 --> 48:29.175
Come on, Rocky.

48:29.275 --> 48:31.405
- Come on.
- All right!

48:33.680 --> 48:36.967
But we do this... my way.

48:37.316 --> 48:39.395
Whatever you say.

48:40.545 --> 48:42.823
Dominate me, baby.

48:52.449 --> 48:54.771
Oh, baby, I'm ready.

48:58.847 --> 49:00.726
Sweet dreams.

49:10.751 --> 49:12.396
Shit.

49:17.140 --> 49:19.260
He said Boulton was right up the road.

49:19.360 --> 49:22.154
I told you you shouldn't have taken
that right turn back there.

49:22.254 --> 49:24.133
Are we lost?

49:45.629 --> 49:48.493
Something tells me we're on the right track.

50:10.219 --> 50:12.917
Damn. Where did they go?

50:14.666 --> 50:18.358
From the look of this place,
they're around here somewhere.

50:26.344 --> 50:28.023
There!

50:29.522 --> 50:33.066
There must be a dozen.
Why did they leave them there?

50:33.376 --> 50:35.221
I don't know.

50:35.971 --> 50:37.975
But we gotta be careful.

50:41.826 --> 50:43.705
Help me!

50:54.390 --> 50:57.853
- Tim, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

50:59.498 --> 51:01.756
Goddamn grave diggers.

51:04.258 --> 51:06.427
Somebody should stand watch.

51:06.527 --> 51:11.192
Don't worry, I circled back around.
I'm sure we gave 'em the slip.

51:13.359 --> 51:15.437
Gonna be a cold night.

51:17.730 --> 51:22.378
Yeah. They say the best way to keep warm
is to pack two bodies to a bag.

51:24.928 --> 51:27.008
Dream on, Reg.

52:14.980 --> 52:17.859
Oh, baby, I like that.

52:35.191 --> 52:38.279
I like it like that. Oh.

52:38.963 --> 52:40.832
Oh, yeah.

52:42.532 --> 52:44.877
Right there. Right there.

52:44.977 --> 52:47.556
Take me, take me!

52:52.660 --> 52:55.628
Hey, Jody. How's it going?

52:56.088 --> 52:59.058
Reg, I need to talk to you
about a couple of things.

52:59.658 --> 53:02.036
I'm kinda busy right now, Jody.

53:02.286 --> 53:05.517
Oh, yeah. Oh, don't stop.

53:05.797 --> 53:08.041
I don't wanna let the lady down.

53:08.141 --> 53:10.512
Yeah, Reg, I kinda need you to get behind me.

53:10.612 --> 53:14.041
I mean, I need you to get
behind what I'm saying.

53:14.441 --> 53:16.436
Like, right now.

53:17.001 --> 53:21.297
Oh, Reggie, oh, you're the best.

53:22.297 --> 53:24.519
Oh, you're so big.

53:25.168 --> 53:27.847
Oh, yes. Ooh.

53:37.064 --> 53:38.336
Jody?

53:42.611 --> 53:44.673
Don't move.

54:03.182 --> 54:06.911
- What's going on, Jody?
- Reg, we gotta get Mike now.

54:07.011 --> 54:11.053
- How the hell are we gonna do that?
- Over here. I'm gonna take you to him.

54:14.351 --> 54:16.979
Hey, hey, wait.

54:17.079 --> 54:18.965
Where the hell are we?

54:19.265 --> 54:22.895
I don't know, man. Somewhere in your mind.

54:26.705 --> 54:28.901
A dry lake bed...

54:31.044 --> 54:33.072
I was here as a boy.

54:44.649 --> 54:48.777
Tell me something.
How does he get you in that ball?

54:48.877 --> 54:51.714
<i>I'll explain everything.
But we've gotta go now.</i>

54:52.214 --> 54:53.892
Wow.

55:03.360 --> 55:05.387
<i>Just step on through.</i>

55:05.487 --> 55:08.864
Oh, Jody, I'm afraid of these things.

55:08.964 --> 55:11.178
<i>Think of it as a doorway.</i>

55:17.858 --> 55:19.879
We gotta make this quick.

56:01.176 --> 56:03.438
Let me out of here!

56:04.138 --> 56:07.504
You know the way out.

56:07.813 --> 56:10.133
I don't know what you mean.

56:10.836 --> 56:14.672
Use your brain, boy.

57:12.815 --> 57:15.219
Come on, brother, we gotta get out of here.

57:24.027 --> 57:26.306
- Come on, let's go.
- Wait. Jody.

57:37.007 --> 57:40.145
Wake up, Reg, wake up.

57:58.962 --> 58:01.299
Whoa, Mike!

58:06.337 --> 58:09.474
- Hey, shut that thing down before...
- He's locked onto me.

58:09.574 --> 58:11.853
He's controlling me through the gate.

58:17.189 --> 58:19.593
Do it, Reg, you've done it before.

58:23.446 --> 58:26.236
Get out of here. He's coming through now.

58:29.269 --> 58:31.332
What the hell's that?

58:39.530 --> 58:42.170
I'm too old for this shit.

58:43.016 --> 58:44.698
- Reggie.
- Thanks, buddy.

58:44.798 --> 58:48.133
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

58:48.923 --> 58:50.918
Where did his hands go?

59:16.584 --> 59:18.622
What is it?

59:18.722 --> 59:21.319
I think it's one of his hands.

59:23.641 --> 59:25.520
Be careful.

59:31.624 --> 59:32.919
Reggie!

59:56.207 --> 59:58.086
Over there.

01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:14.052
Shit, there's the other one.

01:00:15.018 --> 01:00:17.261
Reggie, watch out!

01:00:24.586 --> 01:00:28.767
No, no, no, I can handle this.
I can handle this. I can handle...

01:00:29.377 --> 01:00:31.300
Oh, shit!

01:00:45.657 --> 01:00:47.736
Damn, that was close.

01:00:48.185 --> 01:00:50.264
Close to what?

01:00:58.612 --> 01:01:00.376
It's no use, Reg.

01:01:01.174 --> 01:01:03.620
One way or another, he's gonna get me.

01:01:05.069 --> 01:01:07.338
You're better off leaving me behind.

01:01:07.438 --> 01:01:09.851
We're not leaving anybody behind.

01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:15.319
There's somebody back there.

01:01:24.238 --> 01:01:27.143
- Oh, shit.
- Friends of yours?

01:01:35.825 --> 01:01:37.903
Goddamn it.

01:01:38.452 --> 01:01:40.038
Load this up.

01:01:40.238 --> 01:01:42.925
Let's get those dead assholes
back in the ground where they belong.

01:01:45.927 --> 01:01:47.688
Hold on.

01:02:14.832 --> 01:02:17.689
Shoot her! Shoot that bitch!

01:02:57.442 --> 01:02:59.652
Damn, who were those guys?

01:02:59.752 --> 01:03:02.539
Well, I can tell you this,
they work for the Tall Man.

01:03:02.639 --> 01:03:06.626
- That means he's on our tail.
- Well, it looks like we're on foot.

01:03:06.726 --> 01:03:10.605
- Both front tires are blown.
- Where are we gonna go?

01:03:10.705 --> 01:03:12.927
Into town.

01:03:13.027 --> 01:03:17.379
I say we find that big mortuary
you were telling me about, hole up there.

01:03:17.679 --> 01:03:22.060
- And why the hell would we do that?
- It's the last place he'd look.

01:03:28.523 --> 01:03:30.550
I don't know about this, Mike.

01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:33.537
Our butts could be
hanging out in the wind here.

01:03:33.637 --> 01:03:37.100
Man, I sure hope you know what you're doing.

01:03:56.644 --> 01:03:59.889
- This'll do.
- It's perfect.

01:05:12.912 --> 01:05:15.206
- The mausoleum's empty.
- Nothing in the basement.

01:05:15.306 --> 01:05:18.244
- It's clean.
- Hey, look at this.

01:05:47.289 --> 01:05:48.978
Cold.

01:05:49.689 --> 01:05:51.562
What was that, Mike?

01:05:51.662 --> 01:05:53.754
Uh, just a memory about the Tall Man.

01:05:54.204 --> 01:05:55.892
Yeah?

01:05:55.992 --> 01:05:59.502
Cold. He doesn't like it when it gets cold.

01:06:00.244 --> 01:06:02.630
Why the hell didn't you ever tell me that?

01:06:03.030 --> 01:06:05.742
- We could've done something.
- Shit.

01:06:07.601 --> 01:06:09.748
What the hell are those?

01:06:10.028 --> 01:06:14.175
Cryogenics.
All the mortuaries are into it now.

01:06:14.353 --> 01:06:18.422
These guys figure they'll wake up in
a couple of hundred years with new bodies.

01:06:18.972 --> 01:06:21.868
Some folks never know when to give it up.

01:06:23.619 --> 01:06:25.882
Now, look who's talking.

01:06:28.832 --> 01:06:31.018
We gotta get somebody up on the roof.

01:06:31.118 --> 01:06:33.712
Right, I'll take the first shift.

01:06:33.812 --> 01:06:36.350
You guys better barricade these doors.

01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:16.958
<i>Jody, teach me about him.</i>

01:07:18.683 --> 01:07:20.462
<i>I need to know why.</i>

01:07:56.621 --> 01:07:58.272
<i>What's he doing?</i>

01:07:58.672 --> 01:08:01.119
<i>He's massing an army...</i>

01:08:01.719 --> 01:08:04.161
<i>to conquer dimensions...</i>

01:08:04.261 --> 01:08:05.997
<i>worlds unknown.</i>

01:08:08.175 --> 01:08:11.704
<i>The dwarf creatures
are the by-product of the process.</i>

01:08:11.804 --> 01:08:16.626
<i>Left with only a vestigial part
of the cerebral cortex.</i>

01:08:16.975 --> 01:08:20.439
<i>They act on instinct and impulse.</i>

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.845
<i>He compacts the corpse...</i>

01:08:27.545 --> 01:08:29.790
<i>amputates the mind...</i>

01:08:29.890 --> 01:08:31.950
<i>and encases it.</i>

01:08:45.895 --> 01:08:49.769
<i>He then turns their bodies into drones
and their minds into killers.</i>

01:09:19.781 --> 01:09:22.053
He's still laying in there.

01:09:22.328 --> 01:09:24.529
Let's save some for the boys.

01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:27.354
There's a refrigerator next door.

01:10:39.995 --> 01:10:41.692
Rocky.

01:10:44.767 --> 01:10:47.264
I thought you were asleep.

01:10:53.109 --> 01:10:54.811
Oh, baby.

01:10:55.411 --> 01:10:57.690
You are hot tonight.

01:11:03.536 --> 01:11:05.721
Smells like something's burning.

01:11:06.121 --> 01:11:08.358
It's just me, baby.

01:11:14.021 --> 01:11:18.476
Just wanted a taste before I eat.

01:12:26.279 --> 01:12:29.325
<i>Mike, leave. Now.</i>

01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:30.096
Down.

01:13:32.546 --> 01:13:34.825
Much better.

01:13:38.686 --> 01:13:41.248
Welcome home, boy.

01:13:42.039 --> 01:13:45.644
You've found your way back
to where you started.

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:49.706
Your journey is now complete.

01:13:58.129 --> 01:14:00.425
Damn, you're ugly.

01:14:22.614 --> 01:14:26.335
Let me go! Let me go!

01:14:26.985 --> 01:14:29.063
Let me go!

01:14:39.397 --> 01:14:44.323
You have lived in this
flesh constraint long enough.

01:14:45.011 --> 01:14:47.915
Now it is time for you to come back.

01:14:49.341 --> 01:14:50.709
To me.

01:14:52.009 --> 01:14:55.021
Don't buy it, Mike. He's a liar and a killer.

01:14:55.121 --> 01:14:58.069
Tim. Tim, listen to me,
there are thousands of them!

01:14:58.169 --> 01:15:00.179
Tell Reggie to...

01:15:05.883 --> 01:15:08.387
I have plans for you.

01:15:09.670 --> 01:15:10.929
Later.

01:15:31.551 --> 01:15:35.741
Yo, bitch! Hands off my boy.

01:15:40.059 --> 01:15:42.838
He's mine.

01:16:31.010 --> 01:16:33.483
They got the kid. Come on, let's go.

01:17:18.925 --> 01:17:20.945
Let go of me!

01:17:26.275 --> 01:17:29.836
Let me release you from this imperfect flesh

01:17:29.936 --> 01:17:32.930
that ties you to time and space.

01:17:33.632 --> 01:17:38.034
All that is unknown
be known to you once more.

01:17:48.874 --> 01:17:50.743
Let go of me.

01:17:54.847 --> 01:17:57.357
Hey, catch this.

01:18:00.018 --> 01:18:01.238
Huh?

01:18:24.951 --> 01:18:27.445
If you can keep your head...

01:18:27.945 --> 01:18:30.989
when all about you are losing theirs...

01:18:35.747 --> 01:18:37.684
Come on.

01:18:43.421 --> 01:18:46.082
Hey, wait a minute. Where's Mike?

01:18:47.491 --> 01:18:51.414
Your tall friend's here.
He's got him in the embalming room.

01:18:52.622 --> 01:18:54.491
Let's go.

01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:17.215
Hey, let go of him!

01:19:51.498 --> 01:19:53.183
Yeah.

01:19:53.683 --> 01:19:55.503
Where's Mike?

01:20:06.554 --> 01:20:08.379
Check it out, guys!

01:20:27.427 --> 01:20:29.289
Get down!

01:20:57.523 --> 01:20:59.302
Come on.

01:21:41.602 --> 01:21:43.622
Oh, shit!

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:54.650
Right. Yeah.

01:22:24.855 --> 01:22:26.558
Reggie!

01:23:21.462 --> 01:23:23.229
It's cold.

01:23:27.175 --> 01:23:29.054
Mike, wait up.

01:23:30.203 --> 01:23:31.882
Mike!

01:23:41.608 --> 01:23:43.611
Mike, wait.

01:23:47.213 --> 01:23:49.082
Stay away from me.

01:23:55.171 --> 01:23:56.850
Mike.

01:23:59.234 --> 01:24:01.887
Jody. Jody, hey, wait.

01:24:01.987 --> 01:24:04.038
What the... what the hell's happening here?

01:24:04.138 --> 01:24:07.879
Reg, don't believe everything you see.

01:24:09.794 --> 01:24:12.056
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

01:24:12.839 --> 01:24:14.654
Seeing is easy.

01:24:14.754 --> 01:24:19.063
Understanding?
Well, it takes a little more time.

01:24:21.381 --> 01:24:24.454
Be patient, Reg. We'll be in touch.

01:24:38.924 --> 01:24:41.170
Relax, it's just me.

01:24:45.022 --> 01:24:47.155
Sorry about your friends.

01:24:47.255 --> 01:24:48.907
Yeah.

01:24:50.352 --> 01:24:54.732
It's not over yet. I say we go back inside
and search this place and find out...

01:24:54.832 --> 01:24:57.293
Look, I've had enough.

01:24:57.393 --> 01:25:00.522
It was nice knowing you, boys,
but this kicking zombie ass,

01:25:00.622 --> 01:25:02.886
just ain't my gig.

01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:05.210
I'm out of here, now.

01:25:08.745 --> 01:25:11.337
Rocks, I'm gonna miss you.

01:25:18.764 --> 01:25:20.643
Enough of that.

01:25:24.646 --> 01:25:28.210
Hey, you know, we made a pretty good team.

01:25:30.001 --> 01:25:31.987
Yeah, I know.

01:25:32.087 --> 01:25:35.592
Well, keep the balls in the air, Reg.

01:25:52.872 --> 01:25:55.118
So, what do we do now, Reg?

01:25:56.311 --> 01:25:58.815
We gotta find out what happened to Mike.

01:25:59.815 --> 01:26:02.225
There's gotta be a clue inside.

01:26:02.675 --> 01:26:05.154
Come on, let's take a look around.

01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:09.942
Oh, yeah. Mike told me to tell you something.

01:26:10.042 --> 01:26:12.847
Mike told you
to tell me something about what?

01:26:14.363 --> 01:26:16.048
Uh...

01:26:16.499 --> 01:26:20.356
- that there were thousands of them.
- There it is. Thousands.

01:26:21.136 --> 01:26:23.148
Thousands of what?

01:26:24.215 --> 01:26:26.035
Beats me.

01:26:48.689 --> 01:26:50.425
Reggie?

01:26:51.875 --> 01:26:53.270
Reggie!

01:27:02.895 --> 01:27:04.522
Reggie?

01:27:13.089 --> 01:27:15.151
Get out of here.

01:27:24.067 --> 01:27:26.231
Run, damn it!

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.085
It's all over.

01:27:34.869 --> 01:27:38.008
It's never over.
