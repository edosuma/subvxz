02:15.733 --> 02:17.734
You boys have any luck?

02:17.735 --> 02:18.694
Does the
phrase needle in a haystack

02:18.695 --> 02:19.819
ring a bell?

02:19.820 --> 02:21.613
- Try down there by buck creek.

02:21.614 --> 02:23.240
They mighta got that far.

02:23.241 --> 02:24.241
10-4.

02:26.244 --> 02:28.162
- I want those bastards found.

03:06.492 --> 03:07.784
You got the right head pallet?

03:07.785 --> 03:09.578
All the way up.

03:09.579 --> 03:12.248
Sheriff, they
killed one of the guards.

03:13.332 --> 03:14.333
They cut his throat.

03:16.085 --> 03:17.085
- Geez.

03:18.004 --> 03:19.212
- Somebody give me a hand.
- Keep his head up.

03:19.213 --> 03:22.049
- I need some more bandages.
- Here, pop 'em out.

03:22.091 --> 03:22.925
You got the right head pallet?

03:22.926 --> 03:24.206
- What do you figure they'll do?

03:25.428 --> 03:27.679
- Keep running, make for the border.

03:27.680 --> 03:30.265
Buy a little condo on a lake somewhere

03:30.266 --> 03:32.267
and live happily ever after.

03:32.268 --> 03:34.520
There's only one thing
standing in their way.

03:36.022 --> 03:38.440
4,000 square miles of the roughest country

03:38.441 --> 03:39.817
god ever put on a map.

03:40.860 --> 03:42.737
There's not a road, not a town.

03:43.738 --> 03:45.071
Hell, there's places out there

03:45.072 --> 03:46.699
haven't even seen a footprint.

03:47.908 --> 03:48.950
- Sheriff?
- Put him down there.

03:48.951 --> 03:51.536
All done, let's go.

03:51.537 --> 03:52.787
Who are those guys?

03:52.788 --> 03:54.873
Strap 'em down!

03:57.084 --> 03:58.084
- Find gates.

03:59.503 --> 04:01.588
Lewis gates?

04:01.589 --> 04:02.423
But I thought that you...

04:02.424 --> 04:04.174
- Just find him.

04:04.175 --> 04:05.259
- Yes, sir.

04:07.595 --> 04:09.055
Take it easy, guys.

04:30.409 --> 04:31.868
Rise and shine, Lewis.

04:45.841 --> 04:47.926
- What are you looking at?

04:47.927 --> 04:50.887
You were supposed to stop
me after three, remember?

05:01.899 --> 05:03.567
Lewis!

05:09.907 --> 05:13.743
- I hope you remember where
we parked 'cause I sure don't.

05:13.744 --> 05:14.744
Whoa!

05:34.682 --> 05:35.682
- Lewis!

05:37.059 --> 05:39.477
- I didn't do it, and
whoever said I did is a liar.

05:39.478 --> 05:41.271
- Busload of state prisoners
went off the highway

05:41.272 --> 05:43.858
near Logan pass last night, three escaped.

05:44.775 --> 05:46.736
They're headed straight into the oxbow.

05:48.863 --> 05:50.823
- I don't do that kind of work anymore.

05:54.076 --> 05:55.076
- Lewis, wait!

05:57.580 --> 05:59.289
The FBI showed up.

05:59.290 --> 06:01.916
Lewis, they need one brought out alive.

06:01.917 --> 06:03.793
Deegan himself sent me to find you.

06:11.177 --> 06:13.052
- Tell Deegan he can kiss my ass.

06:13.053 --> 06:14.679
- You're gonna have to do that yourself.

06:14.680 --> 06:15.680
- Briggs.

06:17.141 --> 06:19.601
- Just talk to him,
otherwise he'll chew my butt.

06:19.602 --> 06:20.686
Lewis, please.

06:31.071 --> 06:33.198
- Deegan, I'm telling you
what I told your deputy.

06:33.199 --> 06:34.199
Not interested.

06:36.452 --> 06:39.663
- Now you listen good,
I need you on this one.

06:41.332 --> 06:44.543
Drunk or sober, you're still
the best tracker in the state.

06:45.878 --> 06:47.296
- You always were a charmer.

06:49.048 --> 06:53.009
- Briggs, is that mangy dog of his there?

06:53.010 --> 06:53.969
Could use a bath, sir.

06:53.970 --> 06:55.804
- Well, I just got a complaint

06:55.805 --> 06:57.222
that he's been chasing deer again.

06:57.223 --> 07:00.975
Now / want you to take Mr.
Gates down to the county lockup.

07:00.976 --> 07:03.812
15 days for wildlife harassment

07:03.813 --> 07:06.356
and failure to obey the leash law.

07:06.357 --> 07:07.816
- Leash law?

07:07.817 --> 07:09.692
- You shouldn't provoke him, Lewis.

07:09.693 --> 07:12.404
- Hell, I shouldn't do a lot
of things I end up doing.

07:26.460 --> 07:29.964
- You going in after them convict fellers?

07:31.590 --> 07:33.092
- Yeah, it appears I am.

07:36.136 --> 07:39.181
- My cousin walked into
them mountains 20 years ago.

07:40.015 --> 07:41.016
Never come out.

07:43.978 --> 07:46.396
- Any message in case I come across him?

07:46.397 --> 07:51.402
Yeah, tell him I run off
with his wife.

07:56.031 --> 07:57.031
- Come on, zip.

08:01.954 --> 08:04.247
- Where'd they go in?

08:04.248 --> 08:05.416
- Bottom of the ravine.

08:06.542 --> 08:08.419
Dogs lost the trail at the north fork.

08:11.422 --> 08:12.589
- Armed?

08:12.590 --> 08:14.173
- More than likely.

08:14.174 --> 08:17.719
- 12-Gauge pump and .357
still unaccounted for.

08:17.720 --> 08:21.222
- That'll be 4,000 cash
per man plus expenses.

08:21.223 --> 08:25.435
- You'll get what you're always
paid and not a dime more.

08:25.436 --> 08:27.646
- Come on, zip, I guess
we're going to jail.

08:31.275 --> 08:32.275
- Sheriff.

08:34.320 --> 08:35.320
- Gates!

08:48.417 --> 08:50.335
I don't give a shit about the other two.

08:50.336 --> 08:52.462
Sears comes out alive.

08:52.463 --> 08:55.382
There's one scratch on him,
you don't even get horse feed.

08:58.677 --> 09:00.304
- I'll treat him with kid gloves.

09:46.433 --> 09:48.643
- What are you waiting for?

09:48.644 --> 09:50.187
Go on, get to work.

10:20.300 --> 10:21.468
Good boy, zip.

11:50.390 --> 11:52.976
Looks like we weren't the
only ones who got thirsty.

12:25.884 --> 12:26.885
Four legs or two?

12:28.053 --> 12:29.054
Go on, check it out.

12:44.611 --> 12:45.988
Bah, damn it, zip!

12:48.407 --> 12:49.866
I almost let the air out of you.

12:49.867 --> 12:51.618
Make some noise next time, will you?

13:00.002 --> 13:03.421
Hey, it's my hat, you know.

13:19.146 --> 13:20.146
Howdy, boys.

13:39.041 --> 13:40.042
Ah, relax.

13:40.918 --> 13:42.544
They ain't goin' anywhere.

13:43.587 --> 13:45.672
We can go up and grab them at first light.

13:47.090 --> 13:49.927
Besides, I'm beat.

13:54.264 --> 13:55.891
Tomorrow we cash in, zippy.

13:57.851 --> 14:00.395
Maybe we'll finally get
that log cabin built.

14:02.689 --> 14:05.275
You think you could handle
a real roof over your head?

14:08.487 --> 14:10.697
Course this ain't such a bad roof either.

14:44.064 --> 14:45.690
- Huh, what?
- Shh.

14:45.691 --> 14:46.691
Shh.

14:50.529 --> 14:52.989
- What is it?

14:52.990 --> 14:54.908
- Somebody's out there.

14:59.246 --> 15:00.414
- And the kid?

15:02.916 --> 15:03.917
- Leave him.

15:54.134 --> 15:55.134
- Hee-yah!

15:55.927 --> 15:57.928
- He'll be back.

15:57.929 --> 16:00.640
- Hell no, not with a
gut full of buckshot.

16:06.313 --> 16:07.481
What the hell was that?

16:08.648 --> 16:11.068
- Hey!
- I'm gettin' outta here!

16:20.911 --> 16:24.747
Ah, goddamn it!

16:37.052 --> 16:38.552
Come on!

16:45.602 --> 16:46.602
Shit!

16:53.193 --> 16:54.194
Who are you?

17:06.289 --> 17:07.290
Who are you?

19:47.784 --> 19:49.661
- I was beginning to wonder about you.

19:51.037 --> 19:52.454
Sears gave you any trouble?

19:52.455 --> 19:53.456
- No trouble at all.

19:57.043 --> 19:59.337
You know, we never talked
about what happened.

20:01.006 --> 20:02.090
We should have.

20:04.134 --> 20:05.760
- There's nothing to talk about.

20:06.595 --> 20:07.846
My daughter's dead.

20:11.766 --> 20:13.310
Now where's my man?

20:20.900 --> 20:22.735
- You want the rest of 'em,

20:22.736 --> 20:24.570
you ride in and find 'em yourself.

20:24.571 --> 20:26.780
- What the hell is this?

20:26.781 --> 20:28.825
- That's all that's left of your runners.

20:30.327 --> 20:31.870
- What?
- They're dead.

20:34.080 --> 20:35.080
- All of 'em?

20:35.832 --> 20:36.999
What the hell happened?

20:37.000 --> 20:38.459
- I don't know.

20:38.460 --> 20:40.919
- What do you mean, you don't know?

20:40.920 --> 20:42.171
Goddamn it, don't play games!

20:42.172 --> 20:43.381
- I don't know!

20:49.679 --> 20:52.807
I was moving in, everything was fine.

20:54.017 --> 20:55.934
Then I heard gunshots.

20:55.935 --> 20:58.687
When I got to where they should have been,

20:58.688 --> 21:00.856
all I found was that shirt

21:00.857 --> 21:04.110
and enough blood on the
ground to paint this office.

21:09.824 --> 21:10.659
No bodies, nothing.

21:10.660 --> 21:14.662
- You expect me to believe
this cock and bull story?

21:14.663 --> 21:17.123
- I don't give a damn what you believe.

21:17.165 --> 21:19.041
All I know is that I've wasted four days,

21:19.042 --> 21:20.584
and I'm out 12 grand.

21:20.585 --> 21:22.044
- Where you going?
- Sheriff?

21:22.045 --> 21:22.879
- I need a drink.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.463
- Sheriff, gates is...
- Just leaving.

21:24.464 --> 21:25.882
- I'm not finished with you!

21:26.925 --> 21:28.218
I want some answers!

21:29.511 --> 21:30.929
- Well, that makes two of us.

21:36.226 --> 21:37.226
- Shit.

23:06.483 --> 23:08.233
- I'm looking for professor Sloan.

23:08.234 --> 23:09.319
- Over there.

23:13.239 --> 23:15.115
- Where's professor Sloan?

23:15.116 --> 23:17.117
- Over that way.

23:22.165 --> 23:24.416
- Excuse me, I'm looking
for professor Sloan.

23:31.508 --> 23:35.010
Probably dropped them inside
because...

23:35.011 --> 23:38.096
Bones are broken to indicate othenivise.

23:38.097 --> 23:39.097
- Excuse me.

23:40.475 --> 23:42.726
Where the hell is professor Sloan?

23:42.727 --> 23:44.019
And please don't ask me to go over there.

23:44.020 --> 23:47.064
I've already been over there
and over there and over there.

23:47.065 --> 23:48.774
- Who wants to know?

23:48.775 --> 23:49.651
- Give me a break, lady.

23:49.652 --> 23:52.069
It took me three and a
half hours to drive up here

23:52.070 --> 23:53.654
to meet this guy.

23:53.655 --> 23:55.782
I'm about ready to sic my dog on somebody.

23:56.991 --> 23:58.159
- You call that a dog?

24:02.038 --> 24:05.041
- Will somebody just
point out the old fart?

24:13.216 --> 24:14.384
Lillian Diane.

24:15.343 --> 24:17.803
You're not the first person to
make that mistake, mister...

24:17.804 --> 24:20.598
Gates, Lewis gates.

24:21.474 --> 24:23.058
- Gates.

24:23.059 --> 24:24.726
All right, take this to Sandy

24:24.727 --> 24:26.979
and have her clean it up by tonight, okay?

24:26.980 --> 24:27.980
Good work.

24:28.898 --> 24:32.068
So Mr. Gates, what can
this old fart do for you?

24:34.320 --> 24:36.406
- You don't really look like a professor.

24:38.116 --> 24:39.616
So where'd you find this?

24:39.617 --> 24:40.785
In the oxbow.

24:42.871 --> 24:45.455
- The oxbow, wasn't that just in the news?

24:45.456 --> 24:47.416
Something about convicts?

24:47.417 --> 24:49.544
- Yeah, I'm the guy
they hired to find 'em.

24:51.796 --> 24:52.796
- Bounty hunter?

24:54.841 --> 24:56.717
- Please, a civil servant.

24:56.718 --> 24:58.260
It sounds a little less...

24:58.261 --> 24:59.261
- Barbaric?

25:00.430 --> 25:02.348
- I tracked 'em for four days.

25:02.390 --> 25:04.975
Trail ended in a Meadow, 20 miles in.

25:04.976 --> 25:06.560
Somebody got to those men before I did.

25:06.561 --> 25:08.187
There was blood everywhere and that.

25:09.230 --> 25:10.315
- It's quite a story.

25:11.316 --> 25:13.191
You know what this is?

25:13.192 --> 25:14.819
- Well, call it a wild guess.

25:15.862 --> 25:17.529
An arrow?

25:17.530 --> 25:18.907
- Cheyenne arrow.

25:19.782 --> 25:21.242
Dog soldier, to be exact.

25:22.327 --> 25:23.327
- Dog soldier?

25:24.245 --> 25:25.329
- Within the Cheyenne tribe,

25:25.330 --> 25:26.997
there used to be a military society

25:26.998 --> 25:30.375
made up of the strongest and bravest men.

25:30.376 --> 25:33.503
They were fierce fighters, unyielding.

25:33.504 --> 25:38.091
They called themselves
hotametaneo'o, dog men.

25:38.092 --> 25:42.054
The cavalry called them dog
soldiers or suicide soldiers.

25:42.055 --> 25:43.639
They often acted as a rear guard,

25:43.640 --> 25:46.308
as sort of sacrificial decoys,

25:46.309 --> 25:48.477
so the rest of the tribe could escape.

25:48.478 --> 25:49.312
You see?

25:49.312 --> 25:50.312
- What does it mean?

25:51.522 --> 25:55.025
- Nothing, except maybe another
one of your civil servants

25:55.026 --> 25:56.152
beat you to those men.

25:58.780 --> 26:00.739
- So what about this?

26:00.740 --> 26:03.116
- An authentic reproduction.

26:03.117 --> 26:05.787
About $15 in any tourist shop.

26:09.749 --> 26:12.167
- I saw something in that Meadow.

26:12.168 --> 26:16.004
What, exactly?

26:16.005 --> 26:17.673
- I don't know.

26:17.674 --> 26:20.008
It's just that later I found horse tracks.

26:20.009 --> 26:22.386
- And what's so unusual about that?

26:22.387 --> 26:23.388
- They weren't shod.

26:27.767 --> 26:29.977
I checked through the forest service

26:29.978 --> 26:32.437
and nobody's running
stock up in that country,

26:32.438 --> 26:34.439
and nobody rides unshod horses except...

26:34.440 --> 26:36.901
- Indians, that's what
you're implying, isn't it?

26:38.528 --> 26:39.903
- Well.

26:39.904 --> 26:42.197
- You don't seriously
believe Cheyenne dog soldiers

26:42.198 --> 26:44.826
are running around loose
in the oxbow, do you?

26:47.078 --> 26:47.996
- No, of course not.

26:47.997 --> 26:49.122
I'm just...

26:50.707 --> 26:51.958
I'm not a nutcase, okay?

26:53.292 --> 26:54.793
- I'm sorry I can't help you, but.

26:54.794 --> 26:56.378
Come back here!

26:56.379 --> 26:58.172
Drop that bone, drop it!

26:59.048 --> 27:00.048
Get back here!

27:02.760 --> 27:03.760
Is that your dog?

27:06.055 --> 27:07.390
- Give it back to him, zip.

27:14.355 --> 27:17.232
The group from the
institutes here, doctor.

27:17.233 --> 27:18.317
- I'll be right there.

27:20.903 --> 27:25.783
Mr. Gates, it's been entertaining.

27:27.368 --> 27:28.368
Drive carefully.

27:30.079 --> 27:31.873
- Somebody killed those men, doctor.

27:34.834 --> 27:37.753
It wasn't me, and it wasn't
another bounty hunter.

27:59.525 --> 28:00.525
Zip!

28:02.028 --> 28:03.028
Sorry.

28:03.780 --> 28:06.073
- Are you always this persistent?

28:06.074 --> 28:08.117
- I got halfway home before turning back.

28:10.119 --> 28:11.162
Call it gut instinct.

28:12.538 --> 28:15.207
- And what's this gut
instinct of yours telling you?

28:15.208 --> 28:16.959
- You're not telling me everything.

28:19.545 --> 28:21.047
- You want something to drink?

28:22.548 --> 28:24.383
I thought you'd never ask.

28:34.477 --> 28:36.854
- Well, I'm not hiding anything

28:37.855 --> 28:39.440
you wouldn't eventually uncover.

28:43.277 --> 28:46.321
- Give me that, let go, let go!

28:49.033 --> 28:50.575
Zip, let go!

28:59.001 --> 29:02.045
- So I'm willing to satisfy your curiosity

29:02.046 --> 29:05.132
if you promise not to bother me again.

29:05.133 --> 29:06.133
Deal.

29:08.845 --> 29:11.055
- Mineral water, it's good for you.

29:14.225 --> 29:15.225
Here we are.

29:17.186 --> 29:21.356
By late 1864, many tribes
were raiding settlements,

29:21.357 --> 29:22.191
stealing horses.

29:22.192 --> 29:24.026
Making a general nuisance of themselves.

29:25.611 --> 29:28.321
But one of the few Cheyenne chiefs

29:28.322 --> 29:30.950
really trying to make
peace was black cattle.

29:31.868 --> 29:34.202
He and his people were
instructed to make camp

29:34.203 --> 29:36.164
at sand creek near fort Lyon.

29:37.123 --> 29:38.290
They'd been promised protection,

29:38.291 --> 29:41.626
so that night they had a
feast with dancing and games

29:41.627 --> 29:42.962
to celebrate peace.

29:44.797 --> 29:49.635
The following dawn,
November 29th, was freezing.

29:51.512 --> 29:54.931
A group of Colorado volunteers
known as the bloodless third

29:54.932 --> 29:56.892
surrounded the camp.

29:56.893 --> 29:59.145
They were instructed to
take off their coats.

30:00.062 --> 30:01.062
Strange, huh?

30:02.064 --> 30:04.816
Black cattle immediately
raised an American flag

30:04.817 --> 30:06.985
and the white flag of peace.

30:06.986 --> 30:09.029
People were rushing around
in great panic and fear.

30:09.030 --> 30:10.947
And he kept calling out
not to be frightened.

30:10.948 --> 30:14.285
They'd been promised
protection, there was no danger.

30:15.953 --> 30:17.787
Suddenly the troops attacked.

30:17.788 --> 30:20.791
Now two-thirds of these Indians
were women and children.

30:21.709 --> 30:25.046
It was total chaos, it was a massacre.

30:26.797 --> 30:28.966
Blood froze instantly on the bodies.

30:30.509 --> 30:32.011
And then the looting began.

30:33.054 --> 30:35.180
Scalps were taken.

30:35.181 --> 30:36.806
Fingers, ears, noses cut off.

30:36.807 --> 30:38.642
Babies were cut out of their wombs.

30:38.643 --> 30:40.060
Women had their uteruses cutoff,

30:40.061 --> 30:42.687
and the soldiers wore them on their hats.

30:42.688 --> 30:43.522
As a matter of fact,

30:43.523 --> 30:45.482
when they put their clean coats back on,

30:45.483 --> 30:47.943
they paraded through
Denver with body parts

30:47.944 --> 30:50.112
decorating their uniforms and horses.

30:50.988 --> 30:51.988
- Jesus.

30:53.783 --> 30:55.617
- Among the few that escaped sand creek

30:55.618 --> 30:57.953
were 20 men, women and
children led by lone wolf,

30:57.954 --> 30:59.205
leader of the dog men.

31:00.122 --> 31:02.999
The soldiers chased them
northward through two states,

31:03.000 --> 31:06.128
right up into the mountains
of Northwestern Montana.

31:07.713 --> 31:10.257
A blizzard forced them to turn back,

31:10.258 --> 31:12.009
and they left the Indians for dead.

31:14.011 --> 31:15.471
Here, lone wolf.

31:21.102 --> 31:22.102
There.

31:23.020 --> 31:24.981
Now you know everything there is to know.

31:25.982 --> 31:27.733
It's late, I'm tired, goodnight.

31:29.110 --> 31:30.402
- Wait a minute.

31:30.403 --> 31:32.071
Don't you see, it all adds up.

31:32.905 --> 31:33.905
- What?

31:35.032 --> 31:40.037
- Just suppose, what if
by a fluke or a miracle,

31:40.204 --> 31:44.083
what if lone wolf and
those Cheyenne did survive?

31:44.959 --> 31:46.167
Isn't it possible their descendants

31:46.168 --> 31:47.836
could remain hidden in the oxbow?

31:47.837 --> 31:49.045
- They didn't survive.

31:49.046 --> 31:50.298
- How do you know?

31:51.424 --> 31:53.675
- They were starving in a
hostile environment, winter,

31:53.676 --> 31:54.759
only the clothes on their backs.

31:54.760 --> 31:55.636
They didn't survive.

31:55.637 --> 31:57.304
- Are you sure of that?

31:57.305 --> 31:59.097
- If there were Indians in the oxbow,

31:59.098 --> 32:01.558
don't you think someone
would have seen them by now?

32:01.559 --> 32:02.559
- Not necessarily.

32:03.519 --> 32:04.478
- You are a nutcase.

32:04.479 --> 32:06.439
- No, no, look at the wolf.

32:07.398 --> 32:10.234
Now we know wolves exists
in the oxbow, okay?

32:12.320 --> 32:13.361
I've found their tracks.

32:13.362 --> 32:14.280
I've heard their howls.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.156
I even found a spot where one

32:15.157 --> 32:18.658
watched my camp for half a
day, but I've never seen one.

32:18.659 --> 32:20.577
- That's not the same.
- It is the same.

32:20.578 --> 32:22.495
- It's not the same.

32:22.496 --> 32:25.081
Look, Elvis is dead.

32:25.082 --> 32:26.666
The government isn't hiding ufos,

32:26.667 --> 32:29.669
and there are no Cheyenne dog
soldiers living in the oxbow.

32:29.670 --> 32:32.130
- Why are you being so
goddamned pig-headed?

32:32.131 --> 32:33.758
- 'Cause I'm goddamn good at it!

32:36.093 --> 32:37.093
Look.

32:38.387 --> 32:40.680
I know you saw something
out there you can't explain.

32:40.681 --> 32:41.849
I do believe that.

32:43.059 --> 32:45.602
But I can't invest all this
time and energy in pure fantasy.

32:45.603 --> 32:47.355
I rely on facts.

32:48.314 --> 32:50.732
Now we're both tired, I'm going to bed.

32:50.733 --> 32:52.609
You're welcome to the couch.

32:52.610 --> 32:54.986
But I should warn you.

32:54.987 --> 32:58.324
I tend to walk around
naked in the morning.

33:31.065 --> 33:33.316
- These files contain
copies of every issue

33:33.317 --> 33:34.692
we ever published.

33:34.693 --> 33:35.945
93 years worth.

33:37.113 --> 33:38.279
There you are, son.

33:39.116 --> 33:41.283
- Happy hunting.
- Thank you.

34:35.546 --> 34:36.630
Half-starved.

34:39.467 --> 34:40.801
Nicknamed Jacko.

34:45.806 --> 34:47.433
Doesn't speak a word of English?

35:02.698 --> 35:04.366
- Good morning.
- Hi.

35:09.497 --> 35:11.206
- How you doing today, Mr. Hollis?

35:11.207 --> 35:13.833
- When they gonna put some
goddamn fish in this river?

35:13.834 --> 35:15.961
- Oh, you know, I talked
to the game warden,

35:16.003 --> 35:18.880
and he assures me that
this river is full of fish.

35:18.881 --> 35:20.465
- Oh, he's a liar.

35:20.466 --> 35:22.342
When I was a kid, we'd come down here...

35:22.343 --> 35:24.511
- Mr. Hollis, this is Mr. Gates.

35:24.512 --> 35:26.680
He's gonna visit with you for awhile.

35:31.977 --> 35:32.977
See ya.

35:35.814 --> 35:37.274
- Full of fish, my ass.

35:39.652 --> 35:40.736
Who the hell are you?

35:44.281 --> 35:46.992
- I wonder that myself sometimes.

35:47.034 --> 35:49.786
- Hand me one of them
nightcrawlers, will you?

35:49.787 --> 35:50.787
- Yes, sir.

35:58.045 --> 36:01.172
I understand you used to
work for the railroad.

36:01.173 --> 36:03.800
- Not just any railroad, son.

36:03.801 --> 36:07.179
The great northern pacific, 53 years.

36:09.098 --> 36:10.098
- Mr. Hollis.

36:12.560 --> 36:13.561
Tell me about Jacko.

36:14.562 --> 36:15.562
- Jacko?

36:29.702 --> 36:31.453
Well, I'll be damned.

36:33.664 --> 36:34.998
- You remember then?

36:34.999 --> 36:35.999
- Remember.

36:37.459 --> 36:38.919
I caught the little runt.

36:41.422 --> 36:42.422
- What happened?

36:47.052 --> 36:50.054
- Been a hell of a lot of
years since I thought of that.

36:56.270 --> 36:58.314
'35, I think it was.

36:59.273 --> 37:02.985
Me and old ed valley, we
was headed up the kootenai.

37:03.861 --> 37:05.279
Spur line needed some work.

37:07.781 --> 37:10.075
Sometime past noon,

37:10.117 --> 37:13.202
we spotted something
run across the tracks.

37:13.203 --> 37:15.080
First, I thought it was a deer.

37:16.081 --> 37:17.791
Then I seen it was a boy.

37:22.505 --> 37:24.088
Well, ed stopped the train.

37:24.089 --> 37:25.341
We lit out after him.

37:27.093 --> 37:28.468
Hey, there he is!

37:28.469 --> 37:30.637
We chased him a-ways

37:30.638 --> 37:33.223
and finally cornered
him down on the river.

37:35.851 --> 37:39.062
Soon as we got close, we
seen he was an Indian.

37:39.063 --> 37:42.273
Didn't speak English,
just sort of grunted.

37:42.274 --> 37:43.608
What did you do with him?

37:43.609 --> 37:46.861
Well, me and ed
didn't know what to do with him.

37:46.862 --> 37:51.324
He was cold and tired, so
I wrapped him in my shirt.

37:51.325 --> 37:53.785
We brung him down to sheriff case.

37:53.786 --> 37:56.037
He stuck him in a cell 'cause he didn't

37:56.038 --> 37:57.748
have no other place to put him.

37:58.874 --> 38:01.250
We nicknamed him Jacko

38:01.251 --> 38:04.712
'cause his face kinda
looked wide-eyed and scared,

38:04.713 --> 38:06.131
like a Jack-o-lantern.

38:08.175 --> 38:09.843
Next morning, he was gone.

38:11.887 --> 38:14.138
We figured he squeezed
out through the bars

38:14.139 --> 38:15.432
during the night.

38:17.768 --> 38:19.352
Well, that was the end of it.

38:19.353 --> 38:20.979
Nobody ever seen him again.

38:22.398 --> 38:24.273
Of course, the sheriff contacted some of

38:24.274 --> 38:28.028
the local reservations, but
nothing ever come of it.

38:29.113 --> 38:31.781
Seemed like nobody knew who the boy was

38:31.782 --> 38:33.367
nor where he come from.

38:34.785 --> 38:37.078
- Where do you think he came from?

38:37.079 --> 38:39.790
- Hell, I don't know.

38:40.958 --> 38:42.750
But you tell me,

38:42.751 --> 38:45.670
what's an Indian boy who
don't speak a word of English

38:45.671 --> 38:48.339
doing way out in the middle of nowhere,

38:48.340 --> 38:50.050
60 miles from the nearest town?

39:00.853 --> 39:03.146
- This photo was taken just
after the Cheyenne girls

39:03.147 --> 39:06.066
arrived at the Indian school
in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

39:09.737 --> 39:12.156
The same girls, 14 months later.

39:13.073 --> 39:15.074
Their hair was cut.

39:15.075 --> 39:17.076
They were giving Christian names

39:17.077 --> 39:19.579
and forbidden to speak
in their native tongue.

39:30.090 --> 39:32.175
So began the government's
policy in dealing

39:32.176 --> 39:34.803
with conquered plains tribes.

39:36.096 --> 39:37.514
The policy of um...

39:38.640 --> 39:42.853
The policy of assimilation,
both religious and cultural.

39:46.857 --> 39:47.857
- We need to talk.

39:51.278 --> 39:52.362
Look at this.

39:53.238 --> 39:57.325
17 people disappeared
in the oxbow since 1898.

39:57.326 --> 39:59.453
17 people, doesn't that seem a little odd?

40:01.872 --> 40:03.373
- Do you always wear that hat?

40:09.046 --> 40:10.046
- There's more.

40:15.302 --> 40:20.307
1935, a young Indian boy was
found on the edge of the oxbow.

40:20.682 --> 40:22.267
Didn't speak a word of English.

40:24.269 --> 40:26.021
I talked to the man who caught him.

40:27.147 --> 40:29.023
An Indian boy who doesn't speak English

40:29.024 --> 40:30.733
and vanishes without a trace.

40:30.734 --> 40:31.902
Explain that one.

40:33.570 --> 40:35.696
You rely on facts, isn't
that what you told me?

40:35.697 --> 40:36.990
Well, these are the facts.

40:38.784 --> 40:40.118
- What do you want from me?

40:42.454 --> 40:43.455
- I'm going back in.

40:44.873 --> 40:47.792
If my hunch is right, I don't
want to end up on that list.

40:47.793 --> 40:50.087
I need someone along who speaks Cheyenne.

40:51.839 --> 40:52.673
One of your students?

40:52.674 --> 40:55.466
No, oh no.

40:55.467 --> 40:56.884
- All I'm asking for is a few days.

40:56.885 --> 40:58.427
We'd ride in, we'd take a look around.

40:58.428 --> 41:00.013
We ride back out, three days.

41:02.599 --> 41:04.434
If they're out there, I have to know.

41:05.561 --> 41:06.979
And goddamn it, so do you.

41:32.296 --> 41:33.546
- Mornin'.

41:33.547 --> 41:36.257
- Folks, I'm in a bit
of a rush, so come on.

41:36.258 --> 41:37.258
Come on.

41:39.761 --> 41:41.512
I got a bad feeling about this.

41:41.513 --> 41:44.724
Relax, he seems capable enough.

41:44.725 --> 41:46.059
I don't trust him.

41:47.644 --> 41:49.938
- Let's mount up, we got
a long ride ahead of us.

41:51.899 --> 41:53.233
Good luck, doctor.

41:57.404 --> 41:58.696
- Excuse me?

41:58.697 --> 42:00.489
What the hell are you doing?

42:00.490 --> 42:01.908
- I'm checking the stirrup.

42:01.909 --> 42:03.034
- Oh no, no way.

42:03.035 --> 42:05.161
Hey kid, get back down here!

42:05.162 --> 42:06.829
- Don't listen to him, John.

42:06.830 --> 42:08.831
I'll see you in three days.

42:08.832 --> 42:09.832
You go on now.

42:13.378 --> 42:16.256
Like you said, if they're
in there, I have to know.

42:17.299 --> 42:19.800
- This ain't gonna be a picnic, lady.

42:19.801 --> 42:22.011
I've seen this country
reduce grown men to tears.

42:22.012 --> 42:24.014
It ain't no place for a woman!

42:24.848 --> 42:26.767
- You really are a cowboy, aren't you?

42:30.687 --> 42:32.147
What is it you fellas say?

42:33.231 --> 42:34.399
We're burning daylight.

43:12.771 --> 43:15.106
- Well, maybe we should rest.

43:15.107 --> 43:16.107
- If you're tired.

43:38.172 --> 43:40.881
Smells interesting, what is it?

43:40.882 --> 43:44.093
- Lewis gates wilderness stew.

43:44.094 --> 43:47.555
- Uh huh, and what's in
Lewis gates wilderness stew?

43:47.556 --> 43:49.766
- Anything that ain't nailed down!

43:51.893 --> 43:53.353
- You know, when I was a kid,

43:54.271 --> 43:57.064
I hated the idea of camping out.

43:57.065 --> 44:01.277
I mean, anything that crawled
or buzzed scared me to death.

44:01.278 --> 44:02.695
So what do I do?

44:02.696 --> 44:05.699
I choose a career that keeps
me outdoors 80% of the time.

44:07.159 --> 44:09.202
You know, it's funny how things turn out.

44:10.120 --> 44:13.498
Now I find being in the
wilderness so invigorating.

44:13.540 --> 44:15.499
Life-affirming, really.

44:15.500 --> 44:16.668
- Jesus, wonder woman.

44:24.134 --> 44:26.136
- I've got some aspirin.

44:27.429 --> 44:30.056
- I don't need any aspirin, thank you.

44:30.057 --> 44:32.308
- Boy, aren't we in a great mood.

44:32.309 --> 44:33.851
- Hey look, just because
I let you ride along

44:33.852 --> 44:36.145
doesn't mean I have to like it.

44:36.146 --> 44:37.856
Now stop treating me like a child.

44:38.732 --> 44:39.983
- I didn't realize I was.

44:46.531 --> 44:47.531
Thank you.

45:00.545 --> 45:03.047
- Abraham gates, my grandfather.

45:03.048 --> 45:04.591
- You really hang on to things.

45:07.844 --> 45:08.844
- Some things.

45:10.847 --> 45:12.098
Well?

45:12.099 --> 45:13.099
- Not bad.

45:13.100 --> 45:14.225
Hmm.

45:14.226 --> 45:15.851
- If you don't mind the taste.

45:16.853 --> 45:18.521
- All right, I heard that.

45:18.522 --> 45:21.024
Frow now on, you cook your
own supper, how's that?

45:26.696 --> 45:27.989
- Is he always like this?

45:32.077 --> 45:34.036
Good night, gates.

45:34.037 --> 45:35.037
- Night, doc.

45:39.876 --> 45:44.880
You're not gonna walk around
naked in the morning, are ya?

45:44.881 --> 45:46.925
- I'll try to restrain myself.

45:58.895 --> 46:02.149
- Oh, this is where I found
the arrow and the tracks.

46:03.567 --> 46:05.151
I got at elk hunters in this far,

46:05.152 --> 46:06.820
but never went beyond that Ridge.

46:07.737 --> 46:09.990
And that's the direction
where the tracks are headed.

46:21.084 --> 46:23.502
I wonder how long this
weather will keep up?

46:23.503 --> 46:26.423
- 80% chance of rain through
tonight, clearing by tomorrow.

46:29.092 --> 46:30.092
- Really?

46:32.721 --> 46:33.722
An old Indian trick?

46:35.140 --> 46:37.184
- Kqrp all news radio.

47:17.057 --> 47:18.516
Be careful, this damn shale.

47:19.517 --> 47:21.143
Watch your footing, and I mean it.

47:21.144 --> 47:24.856
Your horse goes down,
you don't go with him.

47:27.275 --> 47:28.318
- Thanks for the tip.

47:33.990 --> 47:35.449
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

47:41.331 --> 47:42.666
Don't even move.

47:48.880 --> 47:50.506
- I told you to watch your step!

47:50.507 --> 47:53.175
You're not in a classroom!

47:53.176 --> 47:55.803
Out here, one little
mistake will get you killed!

48:08.525 --> 48:10.944
Feel free
to discharge, Mr. Gates.

48:13.196 --> 48:14.614
- Do you see that rope?

48:16.825 --> 48:18.158
Yeah.

48:18.159 --> 48:20.328
- Well, let go and grab
it with both hands.

48:21.162 --> 48:22.162
- What about you?

48:22.163 --> 48:23.957
- Don't worry about me, just do it!

48:24.791 --> 48:25.875
- Ready?
- Yeah!

48:26.710 --> 48:27.752
- On three.

48:28.628 --> 48:29.628
One!

48:30.422 --> 48:31.422
Two!

48:32.173 --> 48:33.173
Three!

48:41.224 --> 48:42.224
Zip, zip!

48:44.769 --> 48:46.021
Lead the horse!

48:49.065 --> 48:50.065
Good boy!

48:51.484 --> 48:53.986
That's it, good boy!

48:53.987 --> 48:56.155
Now, pull her up!

49:01.286 --> 49:03.078
Take her her up!

49:20.096 --> 49:21.096
You okay?

49:21.890 --> 49:23.015
Yeah.

49:23.016 --> 49:24.016
I, yeah.

49:26.144 --> 49:29.355
It's just a little
disconcerting to realize

49:29.356 --> 49:33.068
that the smartest member of
our expedition's the dog.

49:36.112 --> 49:38.782
- Saddle up, we still got
two hours of daylight left.

49:43.787 --> 49:45.997
- Zip, do you want a taste?

49:46.956 --> 49:48.332
Want a taste, hmm?

49:48.333 --> 49:49.333
Here, zip.

49:50.126 --> 49:51.378
Let me get you.

49:56.841 --> 49:57.926
Is that good?

49:58.885 --> 49:59.719
Is that good?

49:59.720 --> 50:01.011
- Yeah, you want more?
- Jesus.

50:01.012 --> 50:02.012
Okay.

50:12.690 --> 50:14.984
- You're really in your
element out here, aren't you?

50:17.487 --> 50:18.738
- I like the solitude.

50:21.032 --> 50:23.992
Lately, it seems like
the only time I'm at ease

50:23.993 --> 50:27.872
is when I got 100 miles between
me and the rest of humanity.

50:29.499 --> 50:31.959
- It sounds like you were
born a century too late.

50:31.960 --> 50:34.878
Yeah.

50:34.879 --> 50:37.507
That's what my wife used to say.

50:38.758 --> 50:39.758
- Used to?

50:42.262 --> 50:43.763
- She died a couple years ago.

50:44.848 --> 50:45.848
- I'm sorry.

50:48.268 --> 50:49.268
Was she ill?

50:51.438 --> 50:53.021
- Ngh-ngh.

50:53.022 --> 50:56.818
We were riding in the back
country, making a river crossing.

50:57.652 --> 50:59.653
Horse spooked and bucked her.

50:59.654 --> 51:03.283
I went in after her, the
current was too strong.

51:05.702 --> 51:07.245
One second she was there and...

51:09.622 --> 51:13.126
Her dad still
blames me to this day.

51:15.587 --> 51:17.172
- What more could you have done?

51:20.550 --> 51:21.550
- Drowned.

51:30.059 --> 51:31.059
What about you?

51:31.728 --> 51:32.728
Ever been married?

51:33.855 --> 51:34.898
- Only to my work.

51:39.694 --> 51:42.739
Don't get me wrong, there
have been plenty of men.

51:44.407 --> 51:45.992
Some worked out and some didn't.

51:47.118 --> 51:48.953
It just always had to be on my terms.

51:51.039 --> 51:54.958
- Lady, if I was born a century too late,

51:54.959 --> 51:57.212
you were definitely born
a century too early.

52:05.428 --> 52:08.639
Russell and his wife
came across it Berry picking.

52:11.809 --> 52:14.394
Mrs. Burton said Lewis was in
the chronicle the other day.

52:14.395 --> 52:15.479
He spent three hours going

52:15.480 --> 52:17.273
through old copies of the newspaper.

52:35.583 --> 52:38.670
- What the hell are you up to, gates?

52:43.216 --> 52:44.384
- Oh, you want a drink?

52:45.510 --> 52:46.510
- Love one.

52:53.434 --> 52:57.480
Whiskey, it's good for you.

53:05.321 --> 53:06.656
Curious about one thing.

53:09.784 --> 53:10.784
Why Indians?

53:12.370 --> 53:14.205
- Oh, because I admire them.

53:16.124 --> 53:18.543
And because we owe them a tremendous debt.

53:19.919 --> 53:20.753
- How's that?

53:20.754 --> 53:23.797
- Well, they gave us
romance, myths, legends.

53:23.798 --> 53:26.467
They gave us, they gave us a history.

53:27.302 --> 53:30.179
The Indian shaped the
character of our entire nation.

53:32.015 --> 53:34.725
- We picked a hell of a way
to say thank you, didn't we?

53:34.726 --> 53:36.269
- What happened was inevitable.

53:38.646 --> 53:43.401
The way it happened was unconscionable.

53:47.780 --> 53:49.490
- Would there be any whiskey left?

54:00.043 --> 54:02.545
- My head feels like a
punching bag thanks to you.

54:04.839 --> 54:05.882
- I got some aspirin.

54:14.349 --> 54:17.769
- Oh great, something's chewed
a hole in my sleeping bag.

54:19.854 --> 54:21.438
- Tracks?

54:21.439 --> 54:22.273
- What?

54:22.274 --> 54:23.566
- On the ground, how many toes?

54:26.152 --> 54:27.152
- Four.

54:27.987 --> 54:30.864
- Ah, it's probably some little chipmunk.

54:30.865 --> 54:32.659
Chipmunks, muskrats, squirrels,

54:33.951 --> 54:36.036
they all have four toes in
front, five in the back.

54:36.037 --> 54:39.373
All the others got five
and five.

54:39.374 --> 54:42.125
Now weasels though, now
they're a different story.

54:42.126 --> 54:45.504
They tend to walk on
the balls of their feet.

54:45.505 --> 54:47.714
- Balls of their feet.

54:47.715 --> 54:52.344
Look, we've been riding for a
week, I agreed to three days.

54:52.345 --> 54:53.971
I think we should head back.

54:55.139 --> 54:58.100
It was a romantic idea,
Indians in the oxbow.

54:58.101 --> 55:00.602
I admit, I got caught up myself.

55:00.603 --> 55:03.313
But we have better things to do than go

55:03.314 --> 55:06.942
traipsing around these
mountains looking for ghosts.

55:06.943 --> 55:09.611
If anyone in my department
knew what I was doing out here,

55:09.612 --> 55:10.779
they'd have me committed.

55:11.823 --> 55:14.157
I don't know why I let
you talk me into this.

55:14.158 --> 55:16.451
I have classes to teach.

55:16.452 --> 55:18.121
I have a life.

55:19.288 --> 55:21.498
As soon as we're packed
up, we're heading back.

55:21.499 --> 55:23.918
Understand?

55:25.461 --> 55:28.172
Gates, have you heard a word I've said?

55:31.008 --> 55:32.509
- You want to go back?

55:32.510 --> 55:34.094
- Yes.

55:34.095 --> 55:37.013
I'm an anthropologist, not Daniel Boone.

55:45.440 --> 55:47.567
Have you, have you seen my canteen?

55:50.945 --> 55:52.530
Where's the canteen?

55:56.784 --> 55:58.035
I hate camping.

56:02.290 --> 56:03.290
Gates.

56:04.500 --> 56:05.960
What is the matter with you?

56:12.133 --> 56:13.968
Here's your damn canteen.

56:15.344 --> 56:16.344
Lewis!

56:21.476 --> 56:26.481
No!

56:27.607 --> 56:29.442
No, don't.

56:43.873 --> 56:44.873
Lillian!

57:50.147 --> 57:51.983
Oh my god.

58:01.951 --> 58:05.037
Very slowly toss down your pistol.

58:07.582 --> 58:08.582
- Uh uh.
- Do it.

58:25.141 --> 58:27.435
- Don't move.
- Does breathing count?

58:30.646 --> 58:31.898
Look at them.

58:36.903 --> 58:38.361
What'd he say?

58:38.362 --> 58:40.572
- I'm not sure.
- What?

59:06.223 --> 59:07.557
What are you telling him?

59:07.558 --> 59:10.853
I told him we
come in a good way, in peace.

59:11.896 --> 59:14.147
I also told him you were a great warrior

59:14.148 --> 59:16.734
who wasn't afraid to fight
them all single-handedly.

59:19.737 --> 59:21.238
- You gotta be kidding.

59:22.406 --> 59:24.533
- The Cheyenne admire bravery.

59:25.618 --> 59:28.161
Let's just hope they
don't put you to the test.

59:28.162 --> 59:30.247
- If they do, I'm coming after you first.

59:41.509 --> 59:43.343
- Zip.
- No, don't move.

59:43.344 --> 59:44.386
No!

59:46.305 --> 59:47.847
Hang on, boy.

59:48.683 --> 59:49.683
Hang on.

59:51.477 --> 59:52.477
Zip?

59:56.482 --> 59:58.858
No, no, no, they'll kill you!

1:00:43.237 --> 1:00:47.657
- You were right, they're
Cheyenne dog soldiers.

1:00:47.658 --> 1:00:50.870
In my life, I never would have believed.

1:00:53.372 --> 1:00:56.917
And yet here we are, a
step back into history.

1:00:59.253 --> 1:01:01.796
My god, I feel privileged.

1:01:01.797 --> 1:01:02.797
Lillian!

1:01:28.115 --> 1:01:29.115
- I'm sorry.

1:01:30.034 --> 1:01:31.869
I guess I'm not so tough after all.

1:01:32.745 --> 1:01:33.871
- Like hell you're not.

1:01:54.725 --> 1:01:56.227
She can't walk any further.

1:01:57.436 --> 1:01:58.436
She needs a horse.

1:02:01.148 --> 1:02:02.525
A horse!

1:02:05.402 --> 1:02:07.737
She's weak, she has to ride.

1:02:07.738 --> 1:02:09.280
- Lewis, I'll be fine!

1:02:09.281 --> 1:02:11.575
- Listen, asshole, either she rides

1:02:11.617 --> 1:02:13.953
or you're gonna kill both of us right now!

1:02:14.995 --> 1:02:16.162
You may not understand my words,

1:02:16.163 --> 1:02:17.790
but you get my meaning, don't ya?

1:02:19.291 --> 1:02:20.291
What's it gonna be?

1:05:11.171 --> 1:05:12.171
- Let me take him.

1:05:14.216 --> 1:05:16.552
Please, you're exhausted, come on.

1:05:58.886 --> 1:06:03.139
- Whatever you said, I hope it's friendly.

1:07:03.867 --> 1:07:05.119
- Unbelievable.

1:07:06.745 --> 1:07:10.165
- Yeah, unbelievable.

1:07:13.043 --> 1:07:14.794
It's no use.

1:07:14.795 --> 1:07:17.505
The Indian predates the boy scout.

1:07:17.506 --> 1:07:18.507
The knots are solid.

1:07:21.218 --> 1:07:22.886
- What are they gonna do with us?

1:07:23.804 --> 1:07:24.804
- I don't know.

1:07:25.681 --> 1:07:27.182
- You're the expert, remember?

1:07:28.308 --> 1:07:29.685
- Well, they could kill us,

1:07:30.936 --> 1:07:32.687
but traditionally many Cheyenne prisoners

1:07:32.688 --> 1:07:34.356
were just absorbed into the tribe.

1:07:35.649 --> 1:07:36.649
- Absorbed?

1:07:36.650 --> 1:07:37.609
Yeah.

1:07:37.610 --> 1:07:39.652
They treated their prisoners so well,

1:07:39.653 --> 1:07:42.489
they often refused to go home
even if they had the chance.

1:07:43.907 --> 1:07:45.533
- Yeah, well.

1:07:45.534 --> 1:07:47.119
Their hospitality ovenlvhelms me.

1:07:48.120 --> 1:07:50.037
- Well, you can't blame them, really?

1:07:50.038 --> 1:07:51.123
They're afraid of us.

1:08:20.277 --> 1:08:21.277
- His name is zip.

1:08:38.420 --> 1:08:40.254
Lillian, how do you say "thank you"?

1:08:40.255 --> 1:08:41.215
- Neaese.

1:08:41.215 --> 1:08:42.215
- Neaese!

1:10:06.341 --> 1:10:07.175
- He wants us to follow him.

1:10:07.176 --> 1:10:09.052
- I'm not leaving my dog.

1:10:09.094 --> 1:10:12.097
You don't have a choice.

1:11:38.308 --> 1:11:39.308
- What?

1:11:40.102 --> 1:11:44.523
- This is spotted elk, the last
surviving son of lone wolf.

1:11:58.203 --> 1:11:59.954
He wants to know if
we've come to return him

1:11:59.955 --> 1:12:01.540
to the house of iron bars.

1:12:02.666 --> 1:12:03.999
Seems when he was a small boy,

1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.628
he was captured by some
white men and put in a cage.

1:12:08.797 --> 1:12:09.797
- Jacko.

1:12:16.388 --> 1:12:18.973
Did you get a line on
Mr. Personality here?

1:12:18.974 --> 1:12:20.599
- His name's yellow wolf.

1:12:20.600 --> 1:12:21.976
He's leader of the dog soldiers

1:12:21.977 --> 1:12:24.270
and next in line to be chief.

1:12:24.271 --> 1:12:26.523
- I guess it takes a
real man to shoot a dog.

1:12:27.774 --> 1:12:29.609
- You should be happy they didn't eat him.

1:12:30.485 --> 1:12:31.902
Oh, didn't I tell you?

1:12:31.903 --> 1:12:34.322
That's the other reason
they're called dog soldiers.

1:12:49.504 --> 1:12:50.630
This is where we stay.

1:13:38.845 --> 1:13:41.181
He tells of many Cheyenne killed,

1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:47.561
of his father's flight
from the white soldiers.

1:13:47.562 --> 1:13:49.814
There was a great storm.

1:13:49.815 --> 1:13:53.609
The Indians were lost and starving.

1:13:53.610 --> 1:13:56.738
A wolf appeared and led
them to this valley.

1:13:57.906 --> 1:14:02.661
The wolf spoke, telling
them to remain here,

1:14:03.870 --> 1:14:05.230
hidden from the white man forever.

1:14:10.377 --> 1:14:11.378
He survived.

1:14:12.337 --> 1:14:15.841
This was during the moon when
the deer shed their horns.

1:14:19.719 --> 1:14:21.054
128 winters ago.

1:14:34.317 --> 1:14:35.861
- What's going on over there?

1:14:37.070 --> 1:14:38.321
- I don't know.

1:14:39.281 --> 1:14:40.281
- No, you.

1:14:50.458 --> 1:14:51.458
- My god.

1:15:02.721 --> 1:15:05.681
They were hunting when
his son got separated.

1:15:05.682 --> 1:15:07.850
He was shot by three white men.

1:15:07.851 --> 1:15:09.895
Yellow wolf and the dog men killed them.

1:15:12.022 --> 1:15:15.441
He's burning up, the
infection must be spreading.

1:15:15.442 --> 1:15:16.442
- Lillian.

1:15:17.736 --> 1:15:18.820
Tell me what he needs.

1:15:19.905 --> 1:15:22.449
Why don't you try and
convince them, and I'll ride.

1:15:30.665 --> 1:15:33.376
- He says the decision's not his.

1:15:42.928 --> 1:15:44.219
It's good you offer,

1:15:44.220 --> 1:15:45.930
but his people have survived all this time

1:15:45.931 --> 1:15:47.640
without the white man's help.

1:15:47.641 --> 1:15:50.143
To ask for it now might
make something bad happen.

1:16:19.798 --> 1:16:22.967
Penicillin, as much as you can get.

1:16:22.968 --> 1:16:25.595
- Isn't that hard to come
by without a prescription?

1:16:26.471 --> 1:16:27.847
- Use your imagination.

1:16:29.015 --> 1:16:30.641
- Right.

1:16:30.642 --> 1:16:32.060
Tell him I need my pistol.

1:16:43.238 --> 1:16:45.322
Now my knife.

1:16:45.323 --> 1:16:46.157
- Lewis, I don't think it's...

1:16:46.158 --> 1:16:48.993
- The knife.

1:17:01.464 --> 1:17:03.257
Oh, one more thing.

1:17:04.300 --> 1:17:05.426
- What the hell are you doing?

1:17:05.427 --> 1:17:06.677
- That's for zip.

1:17:12.475 --> 1:17:13.767
That was stupid.

1:17:13.768 --> 1:17:15.562
- Well, I'm sorry, Lillian,

1:17:17.355 --> 1:17:21.108
but before I do somebody a
favor, the score has to be even.

1:17:21.109 --> 1:17:22.360
That's just the way I am.

1:17:30.035 --> 1:17:32.453
- He'll ride with you part of the way.

1:17:32.454 --> 1:17:33.454
Be careful.

1:17:41.296 --> 1:17:43.465
If you don't come back, I'll be killed.

1:17:45.341 --> 1:17:46.718
It's just the way he is.

1:18:28.510 --> 1:18:29.510
- Damn it!

1:18:40.814 --> 1:18:41.855
Okay, girl.

1:19:18.101 --> 1:19:20.144
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:19:20.145 --> 1:19:22.062
Easy, easy, whoa.

1:19:22.063 --> 1:19:23.148
Easy, girl, easy.

1:19:25.066 --> 1:19:26.608
Easy.

1:19:31.156 --> 1:19:33.907
Whoa, whoa, whoa, girl, whoa!

1:19:35.618 --> 1:19:37.202
Whoa, girl!

1:20:03.354 --> 1:20:04.354
You did good, girl.

1:20:21.539 --> 1:20:22.664
- With you in a minute.

1:20:25.919 --> 1:20:26.919
I said I'd be.

1:20:28.588 --> 1:20:31.131
- That's the problem with this country.

1:20:31.132 --> 1:20:33.008
Nobody works anymore.

1:20:37.972 --> 1:20:41.225
611, 611,
silent alarm at cadmore drugs.

1:20:41.226 --> 1:20:43.018
213 west main.

1:20:43.019 --> 1:20:44.228
- Don't do it, buddy.

1:20:44.229 --> 1:20:46.063
I've got grandchildren.

1:20:46.064 --> 1:20:46.898
- Relax, will ya?

1:20:46.899 --> 1:20:48.107
Penicillin, you got that?

1:20:50.735 --> 1:20:52.070
Bag it up, go on.

1:21:02.705 --> 1:21:03.705
Halt!

1:21:05.208 --> 1:21:06.500
- Briggs.

1:21:06.501 --> 1:21:09.628
- Don't try anything, I
already called for back up.

1:21:09.629 --> 1:21:10.879
- Oh, now why'd you go and do that?

1:21:10.880 --> 1:21:13.674
396, 396, all
units, robbely in progress.

1:21:13.675 --> 1:21:15.677
- Now you just stay right where you are.

1:21:16.719 --> 1:21:17.719
Suspect is armed.

1:21:17.720 --> 1:21:20.347
- Put that way before you hurt somebody.

1:21:20.348 --> 1:21:21.974
- No more games, Lewis.

1:21:22.976 --> 1:21:24.518
I'm taking you in.

1:21:24.519 --> 1:21:26.728
- Stop that man, hejust robbed me!

1:21:28.481 --> 1:21:29.731
- Rule number one, Briggs.

1:21:29.732 --> 1:21:31.567
Never take your eyes off the suspect.

1:21:56.968 --> 1:21:59.762
Lewis, pull over!

1:21:59.804 --> 1:22:01.139
- You pull over!

1:22:07.228 --> 1:22:09.187
Hey, what are you doing, no!

1:22:32.337 --> 1:22:34.005
- Get outta the way!

1:22:51.773 --> 1:22:53.732
What the hell are you doing, Lewis?

1:23:46.119 --> 1:23:48.955
Sheriff, look at this!

1:24:44.343 --> 1:24:46.929
- You think he's gonna make it?

1:24:47.972 --> 1:24:49.432
- It's too soon to know.

1:25:00.318 --> 1:25:01.318
Ow!

1:25:26.886 --> 1:25:27.886
Okay.

1:26:07.969 --> 1:26:10.136
Lewis gates wilderness stew.

1:26:10.137 --> 1:26:12.556
Good, and it's good for you too.

1:26:12.557 --> 1:26:13.808
Here, try that.

1:26:15.601 --> 1:26:16.893
No?

1:26:16.894 --> 1:26:18.312
Ah, come on, hey!

1:26:19.772 --> 1:26:21.356
No, you try that.

1:26:22.441 --> 1:26:24.001
No, you don't know what you're missing.

1:26:27.154 --> 1:26:29.197
Oh, it's very nice,
but really, I couldn't.

1:26:29.198 --> 1:26:30.407
- This is a rare showing of thanks.

1:26:30.408 --> 1:26:33.410
To refuse their gifts is to insult them.

1:26:34.829 --> 1:26:37.415
Neaese, neaese, very beautiful.

1:26:47.425 --> 1:26:49.927
- Lillian, what am I gonna
do with all this stuff?

1:26:51.345 --> 1:26:53.346
- Oh, what all rich,
eligible bachelors do.

1:26:53.347 --> 1:26:55.558
Find a wife and settle down.

1:27:00.104 --> 1:27:02.188
- Yeah funny, very funny.

1:28:26.190 --> 1:28:27.190
Jesus.

1:28:28.484 --> 1:28:29.902
Are you shocked?

1:28:30.861 --> 1:28:32.737
You known about this?

1:28:32.738 --> 1:28:33.738
- For a while.

1:28:34.949 --> 1:28:36.409
Spotted elk brought me here.

1:28:37.493 --> 1:28:39.787
He was curious about some of the things.

1:28:43.541 --> 1:28:44.500
When game's scarce,

1:28:44.501 --> 1:28:46.418
they're forced to hunt outside the valley.

1:28:46.419 --> 1:28:48.212
That's when they run into white men.

1:28:49.213 --> 1:28:53.342
They hide from most, but
those that venture too close.

1:28:54.260 --> 1:28:55.344
End up here.

1:28:56.637 --> 1:28:58.722
- Wouldn't you kill to protect your family

1:28:58.723 --> 1:28:59.849
and your way of life?

1:29:21.871 --> 1:29:23.121
Oh, he wants to know about the silver bird

1:29:23.122 --> 1:29:24.373
with the long white tail.

1:29:50.733 --> 1:29:53.735
I just told them a man walked on the moon.

1:29:56.323 --> 1:29:59.032
He just called me a
wonderful liar.

1:29:59.033 --> 1:30:00.074
Yeah.

1:30:10.085 --> 1:30:10.920
What is it?

1:30:10.921 --> 1:30:12.212
- He wants to know about other Cheyenne,

1:30:12.213 --> 1:30:13.255
where they're living.

1:30:14.757 --> 1:30:16.217
- What are you gonna tell him?

1:30:17.551 --> 1:30:18.551
- The truth.

1:31:54.189 --> 1:31:55.189
No!

1:32:23.844 --> 1:32:25.387
- Do you hear that?

1:32:27.348 --> 1:32:29.808
I've waited all my life to hear that.

1:32:32.353 --> 1:32:33.854
- You know something, Lillian?

1:32:37.775 --> 1:32:40.027
We can't let anything
happen to these people.

1:32:41.153 --> 1:32:42.613
No one must ever find out.

1:32:44.573 --> 1:32:45.573
No one.

1:33:15.938 --> 1:33:16.938
Deegan.

1:33:19.859 --> 1:33:21.485
- My father-in-law.

1:33:22.569 --> 1:33:24.237
I covered my back trail,
how did they find it?

1:33:24.238 --> 1:33:25.571
How much time do we have?

1:33:25.572 --> 1:33:27.782
They're three
miles from the waterfall.

1:33:27.783 --> 1:33:29.118
Half a day, maybe less.

1:33:32.413 --> 1:33:33.413
Damn!

1:33:52.433 --> 1:33:53.850
Spotted elk
wants to leave the valley

1:33:53.851 --> 1:33:56.436
and travel deeper into the mountains.

1:33:56.437 --> 1:33:57.979
But yellow wolf says there's no time.

1:33:57.980 --> 1:33:59.314
They should stay and fight.

1:34:00.858 --> 1:34:03.151
- Jesus, they'll get slaughtered.

1:34:03.152 --> 1:34:05.236
- The Cheyenne or the troopers?

1:34:08.699 --> 1:34:10.451
- What if we created a diversion?

1:34:12.578 --> 1:34:14.329
Maybe it'd buy 'em some more time.

1:34:44.276 --> 1:34:48.447
- From this time on, do
not mistreat the Cheyenne.

1:34:49.615 --> 1:34:50.948
Think of us in a good way.

1:34:55.245 --> 1:34:56.705
All of us are your relations.

1:35:11.970 --> 1:35:14.348
You exchange gifts in the ceremony.

1:35:17.935 --> 1:35:21.396
- Lilian, they've already
got everything I own.

1:35:53.428 --> 1:35:54.428
- From this time on,

1:35:54.429 --> 1:35:56.430
you're one of the like-hearted people.

1:35:56.431 --> 1:35:58.015
You are Cheyenne.

1:35:58.016 --> 1:35:59.016
Go in a good way.

1:36:38.265 --> 1:36:39.265
- What?

1:36:40.434 --> 1:36:42.018
- I was just thinking how much I'm gonna

1:36:42.019 --> 1:36:44.813
miss your wilderness stew.

1:36:47.191 --> 1:36:49.026
- Knock it off, Lillian, saddle up.

1:36:52.196 --> 1:36:53.571
- I'm afraid this is
another journey you're

1:36:53.572 --> 1:36:55.115
gonna have to make on your own.

1:36:56.074 --> 1:36:58.410
I've asked spotted elk
if I can stay with them.

1:37:04.374 --> 1:37:06.500
- Get on your horse, Lilian.

1:37:06.501 --> 1:37:09.296
- No, my work's just begun.

1:37:10.297 --> 1:37:14.551
I want a living record
set down, a memorial,

1:37:15.469 --> 1:37:16.762
to the last of their kind.

1:37:18.305 --> 1:37:19.472
- Have you lost your mind?

1:37:19.473 --> 1:37:21.642
- I've spent half my life teaching others.

1:37:22.643 --> 1:37:25.937
Now out here with these
people, I'm the student.

1:37:25.938 --> 1:37:28.023
I'm living it.

1:37:30.442 --> 1:37:31.442
I belong with them.

1:37:33.862 --> 1:37:34.862
I'm staying.

1:37:40.661 --> 1:37:41.661
- Damn it, Lilian.

1:37:43.372 --> 1:37:45.832
- Why don't you admit the
real reason you're upset?

1:37:50.295 --> 1:37:51.296
You'll miss me.

1:37:57.678 --> 1:37:58.762
- Let's go, zip.

1:38:01.431 --> 1:38:03.100
Looks like it's just the two of us.

1:38:04.309 --> 1:38:05.309
Zip.

1:38:09.273 --> 1:38:10.440
No, not you too.

1:38:12.025 --> 1:38:13.193
I don't believe this.

1:38:22.411 --> 1:38:27.416
Well, I guess I always knew a
woman would come between us.

1:38:27.541 --> 1:38:29.834
You're better off here anyway.

1:38:29.835 --> 1:38:31.795
I got a feeling I'm headed for trouble.

1:38:33.005 --> 1:38:34.214
Take care of her.

1:38:35.757 --> 1:38:36.757
Hmm?

1:38:54.735 --> 1:38:56.153
He likes to sleep with it.

1:39:00.157 --> 1:39:01.157
- Neaese.

1:39:07.581 --> 1:39:10.417
Neaese yourself.

1:39:16.214 --> 1:39:17.214
This oughta help.

1:39:19.009 --> 1:39:21.053
- That looks ancient, is it still good?

1:39:22.596 --> 1:39:23.888
- Dynamite?

1:39:23.889 --> 1:39:26.767
It's like wine, it only
gets better with age.

1:39:38.695 --> 1:39:39.529
Jesus!

1:39:39.530 --> 1:39:41.781
Hey, hey, easy, easy.

1:39:48.830 --> 1:39:49.830
You see this?

1:39:51.958 --> 1:39:53.585
Over time, it sweats, huh?

1:39:57.422 --> 1:39:58.507
Nitro, big boom!

1:39:59.925 --> 1:40:01.133
God.

1:40:06.932 --> 1:40:09.810
Well, this is goodbye.

1:40:14.022 --> 1:40:15.022
Lil.

1:40:19.736 --> 1:40:21.446
Can you promise me something?

1:40:22.656 --> 1:40:26.201
No matter how bad it gets,
no matter what happens,

1:40:28.412 --> 1:40:29.704
don't let them eat my dog.

1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:35.001
- I promise.

1:40:40.549 --> 1:40:45.262
- Say, you really walk
around naked in the morning?

1:40:46.138 --> 1:40:49.057
- Do weasels really walk around
on the balls of their feet?

1:40:51.893 --> 1:40:56.064
Yeah.

1:40:58.150 --> 1:41:02.237
- Well, what would you
say to a goodbye kiss?

1:41:04.739 --> 1:41:06.241
- I'd say it's about time.

1:41:14.875 --> 1:41:15.834
- What the hell was that?

1:41:15.835 --> 1:41:18.085
You call that a kiss?

1:41:18.086 --> 1:41:19.086
- Well.

1:42:51.930 --> 1:42:52.930
- Better.

1:42:56.142 --> 1:42:57.602
- I'm a good student.

1:44:36.576 --> 1:44:37.576
Howdy, bill.

1:44:39.245 --> 1:44:40.288
- Lewis.

1:44:46.002 --> 1:44:47.002
- That too tight?

1:44:49.631 --> 1:44:52.633
- I'm sorry about the
cheap shot back in town.

1:44:52.634 --> 1:44:53.634
Nothing personal.

1:45:04.062 --> 1:45:06.355
- There's a cave halfway up.

1:45:06.356 --> 1:45:08.358
Goes all the way through the waterfall.

1:45:10.443 --> 1:45:12.277
- All right, men, mount up!

1:45:12.278 --> 1:45:13.278
- Deegan.

1:45:17.117 --> 1:45:19.076
You're making a mistake.

1:45:19.077 --> 1:45:21.662
- You do this, you're
gonna get these men killed.

1:45:21.663 --> 1:45:23.372
- All right, men, let's move out.

1:45:23.373 --> 1:45:25.833
- Hee-yah, hee-yah, hee-yah!

1:45:26.752 --> 1:45:27.918
- Stop him!
- Damn it!

1:45:27.919 --> 1:45:29.878
- Hee-yah!
- Come on!

1:46:31.775 --> 1:46:33.567
Drop it!

1:46:33.568 --> 1:46:35.111
I'll kill you where you stand!

1:46:38.698 --> 1:46:40.116
Drop the damn gun!

1:46:42.035 --> 1:46:43.035
Do it now!

1:46:55.256 --> 1:46:57.674
Put it down, gates.

1:48:09.330 --> 1:48:10.747
- He's hit bad!

1:48:10.748 --> 1:48:12.959
- What do we do now, deputy?

1:48:18.047 --> 1:48:19.756
- We're going back!

1:48:19.757 --> 1:48:22.676
Come here, give me a hand,
I need some help here!

1:49:12.226 --> 1:49:14.270
- They tell me that you saved my life.

1:49:15.647 --> 1:49:18.232
You did for me what you
couldn't do for my daughter.

1:49:21.027 --> 1:49:22.779
I wish to god it was the other way.

1:49:24.822 --> 1:49:26.783
I'm tired of hating you, Lewis.

1:49:28.242 --> 1:49:29.077
When you're ready,

1:49:29.078 --> 1:49:31.287
I think maybe it's time we have that talk.

1:49:36.668 --> 1:49:39.170
Well.

1:49:40.254 --> 1:49:43.549
Nobody around here, including me,

1:49:46.260 --> 1:49:47.886
wants to see you put away for

1:49:47.887 --> 1:49:50.056
stealing some penicillin,
for Christ's sake.

1:49:53.309 --> 1:49:54.811
So we're dropping the charges.

1:49:56.521 --> 1:49:59.106
But there's something I have to know.

1:49:59.107 --> 1:50:03.193
In that tunnel, just before the explosion,

1:50:03.194 --> 1:50:04.278
I thought that I saw.

1:50:08.032 --> 1:50:09.033
What's out there?

1:50:19.752 --> 1:50:21.379
- What do you think is out there?

1:50:24.090 --> 1:50:25.090
Okay.

1:50:27.468 --> 1:50:28.468
Fine.

1:50:38.271 --> 1:50:39.647
Whatever you're protecting,

1:50:41.941 --> 1:50:42.984
I hope it's worth it.
