<i>Auradon.</i>

00:08.928 --> 00:10.794
<i>It's beautiful, isn't it?</i>

00:11.197 --> 00:14.963
<i>I'm Mal, daughter of Maleficent.
And this is my home.</i>

00:15.335 --> 00:16.427
<i>It wasn't always.</i>

00:16.703 --> 00:18.467
<i>I was born
on the Isle of the Lost,</i>

00:18.738 --> 00:20.729
<i>where all of the villains
had been banished,</i>

00:21.007 --> 00:22.168
<i>locked away for good.</i>

00:22.375 --> 00:24.571
<i>That is until Prince Ben decided
that their children</i>

00:24.711 --> 00:25.769
<i>should have a chance.</i>

00:26.012 --> 00:28.174
<i>And so, four villain kids,
the V.K.'s,</i>

00:28.381 --> 00:29.746
<i>came to Auradon, including me.</i>

00:29.983 --> 00:32.008
<i>Long story short,
Ben is the king now,</i>

00:32.218 --> 00:34.880
<i>I'm his girlfriend, and we
are about to head back</i>

00:35.088 --> 00:37.318
<i>to the Isle to pick
what will hopefully be</i>

00:37.657 --> 00:40.524
<i>a long line of new V.K.'s
who get to come to Auradon</i>

00:40.693 --> 00:43.287
<i>and find their
happily ever afters, too.</i>

00:49.569 --> 00:51.128
Hey, check it out!

00:55.909 --> 00:58.003

00:58.144 --> 01:00.044
- It's V.K. day.

01:51.231 --> 01:53.791
<i>Because everyone's
Gonna get their chance</i>

01:55.235 --> 01:57.897
<i>They said that being
From the Isle was bad</i>

01:58.104 --> 02:01.404
<i>Well it's good to be bad
And we're proof of that</i>

02:01.541 --> 02:03.407
<i>Used to be lost
Now we're on the map</i>

02:03.643 --> 02:05.475
<i>Used to steal stacks
Now we're giving back</i>

02:05.612 --> 02:08.513
<i>Remember that
It's good to be bad</i>

02:08.681 --> 02:11.275
<i>If you got pride
Raise your Vs up high</i>

02:11.584 --> 02:13.313
<i>Wave them wide side to side</i>

02:13.486 --> 02:17.013
<i>Feel the vibe
It's good to be bad</i>

02:32.605 --> 02:34.369
<i>I wanna see you all rep
Your block</i>

02:34.440 --> 02:36.636
<i>I wanna see you all rep
Your block, hey!</i>

02:36.810 --> 02:38.505
<i>Show your pride
Let me hear ya shout</i>

02:38.611 --> 02:40.306
<i>We're from the Isle
Of the Lost</i>

02:40.413 --> 02:42.677
- <i>Yeah!</i>
- <i>We're here to celebrate</i>

02:42.816 --> 02:44.477
<i>We're here to elevate</i>

02:45.018 --> 02:46.508

<i>Today's the day
That you won't forget</i>

02:52.992 --> 02:55.689
<i>The best to come
Ain't happened yet</i>

02:57.430 --> 03:00.195
<i>Take a bow
It won't be your last</i>

03:01.201 --> 03:04.171
<i>You're from the Isle
If anybody asks</i>

03:04.437 --> 03:07.270
<i>It's good to be bad
And we're proof of that</i>

<i>Feel the vibe
It's good to be bad</i>

03:22.422 --> 03:25.824
<i>They can try to deny our style
But we were born this way</i>

03:26.125 --> 03:27.923
<i>Because you can take the V.K.
Out of the Isle</i>

03:27.994 --> 03:30.088
<i>But you can't take the Isle
Out of the V.K.</i>

03:30.230 --> 03:32.164
<i>If you wanna make it hype
Not a moment to waste</i>

03:32.232 --> 03:34.462
<i>Make it loud, make it live
Make it jump to the bass</i>

03:34.534 --> 03:36.298
<i>Make it what you want
But you'd better make your case</i>

03:36.436 --> 03:38.165
<i>Because the Isle makes us
And we're repping this place</i>

03:38.338 --> 03:40.397
<i>So, when I say, "V"
You say, "K"</i>

03:40.673 --> 03:42.539
- <i>V</i>
- <i>K</i>

03:42.775 --> 03:44.539
<i>When I say, "All"
You say, "Day"</i>

03:44.911 --> 03:46.675
- <i>All</i>
- <i>Day</i>

03:46.880 --> 03:48.848
<i>When I say, "V"
You say, "K"</i>

03:49.015 --> 03:50.813
- <i>V</i>
- <i>K</i>

03:50.984 --> 03:53.009
<i>When I say, "All"
You say, "Day"</i>

03:53.286 --> 03:54.515
<i>All day</i>

03:57.957 --> 03:58.947
<i>Come on</i>

04:02.729 --> 04:05.562
<i>Hey, it's good to be bad</i>

04:11.504 --> 04:14.405
<i>It's good to be bad
And we're proof of that</i>

04:14.607 --> 04:16.473
<i>Used to be lost
Now we're on the map</i>

04:16.676 --> 04:18.644
<i>Used to steal stacks

04:21.748 --> 04:24.445
<i>If you got pride
Raise your Vs up high</i>

04:24.684 --> 04:26.413
<i>Wave them wide side to side</i>

04:26.619 --> 04:30.522
<i>Feel the vibe
It's good to be bad</i>

04:34.928 --> 04:36.453
Who wants to go? You?

04:36.629 --> 04:38.563
Yes,
pick me, Mal! Pick me!

04:40.099 --> 04:41.498
Yeah, pick me, Mal!

04:43.703 --> 04:45.467
Pick me, Mal!
Pick me!

04:48.174 --> 04:50.074
- Are you excited?
- Are you kidding?

04:50.176 --> 04:51.735
I'm so excited.

05:00.053 --> 05:02.579
I can't believe this day
has finally arrived.

05:05.892 --> 05:08.384
I honestly wish
we could take you all with us

05:08.661 --> 05:12.427
and some day, very soon,
maybe we can.

05:12.699 --> 05:14.394
Yeah, we're gonna be back here
so many times.

05:14.534 --> 05:15.763
You're going to be
so sick of us.

05:15.835 --> 05:18.031
So sick of us.

05:18.905 --> 05:20.600
Can I get a drum roll, please?

05:24.777 --> 05:27.178
First, I would like to begin,

05:27.514 --> 05:29.346
with the granddaughter
of Lady Tremaine,

05:29.749 --> 05:31.114
daughter of Drizella,

05:31.417 --> 05:32.907
- my sweet, sweet friend.
- That's you.

05:33.686 --> 05:35.780
My Dizzy.

05:40.160 --> 05:42.151
Next, is son of Smee.

05:43.429 --> 05:44.453
Come on, Squeaky.

05:52.138 --> 05:53.902
And no way,
we're splitting up the twins,

05:54.040 --> 05:56.338
so get over here, Squirmy,
come on.

05:59.979 --> 06:02.038
- Congratulations!
- Bring it in, buddy!

06:02.248 --> 06:05.183
And last,
but certainly not least,

06:05.385 --> 06:07.251
we all picked this girl
because we all agreed

06:07.587 --> 06:09.851
that she could use a little bit
of Fairy Godmother's

06:09.989 --> 06:11.013
goodness class.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.620
Give it on up
for Dr. Facilier's daughter,

06:13.793 --> 06:15.022
- Celia.
- I'm back.

06:21.100 --> 06:22.898
We'll be back for you guys,
next week, okay?

06:23.069 --> 06:25.731
And so, pack your stuff,
your own stuff.

06:27.273 --> 06:29.469
- Where are we going?
- We're going to...

06:29.876 --> 06:32.243
Auradon!

06:57.303 --> 06:59.635
Not a tentacle in sight.

07:01.708 --> 07:04.302
I think if Uma was up
to something, we'd know by now.

07:04.477 --> 07:06.673
No, Ben,
I know how villains think.

07:06.946 --> 07:09.313
And I don't trust Uma,
as far as I can throw her.

07:09.482 --> 07:11.007
She's gonna wait
until our defenses are down

07:11.184 --> 07:12.777
and then,
that's when she's gonna strike.

07:13.019 --> 07:15.010
I really wish I had time
to go do the dragon flyover

07:15.221 --> 07:16.814
because I can go so much higher.

07:17.223 --> 07:19.317
Well, you can't be everywhere
at once.

07:20.226 --> 07:21.694
Besides, I've got your back.

07:24.697 --> 07:26.187
Now, come on,
everyone's waiting for us.

07:26.399 --> 07:28.026
Wait.
But you're getting more guards?

07:28.234 --> 07:30.362
I'm getting more guards,
now breathe.

07:32.805 --> 07:34.273
- Now, come on.
- Okay.

07:40.013 --> 07:42.141
- No, no, I'm doing this.
- And you know what that means.

07:43.883 --> 07:44.873
Hey, girl.

07:45.485 --> 07:47.749
Here they come.

07:54.260 --> 07:55.921
Hey, how are you?

08:09.776 --> 08:11.437
- Stay.
- Stay here?

08:11.678 --> 08:12.668
Yes.

08:17.817 --> 08:19.842
Bippity-boppity,
one, two, one, two.

08:19.986 --> 08:21.181
Can everybody hear me?

08:21.955 --> 08:22.945
Yes.

08:25.158 --> 08:26.148
Ben.

08:26.559 --> 08:28.391
Thank you, Fairy Godmother.

08:31.331 --> 08:32.457
What's up, Auradon?

08:36.169 --> 08:37.568
Thank you. Thank you so much

08:37.703 --> 08:39.604
for coming out
to welcome our new arrivals.

08:40.140 --> 08:43.576
- They'll be here soon.
- Not like we had a choice.

08:45.912 --> 08:47.778
It worked out pretty well
for the first four.

08:48.148 --> 08:49.877
Yeah, especially for you.

08:50.517 --> 08:51.780
Really funny.

08:54.788 --> 08:59.021
Mal, this is the exact spot
we first met not so long ago.

09:00.660 --> 09:02.719
I feel like I've known you
my whole life.

09:04.597 --> 09:07.692
But did I mention,
I'm in love with you?

09:08.134 --> 09:09.795
Aw.

09:11.971 --> 09:13.905
<i>I met this girl
That rocked my world</i>

09:14.073 --> 09:15.734
<i>Like it's never been rocked</i>

09:15.975 --> 09:19.969
<i>And now I'm living just
For her and I won't ever stop</i>

09:20.246 --> 09:24.444
<i>I never thought that
It could happen to a guy like me</i>

09:24.684 --> 09:26.778
<i>But now look
At what you've done</i>

09:27.120 --> 09:31.148
<i>You got me down on my knee</i>

09:35.728 --> 09:36.991
Mal, it's you and me.

09:37.564 --> 09:38.759
It's you and me forever.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.032
Will you marry me?

09:43.369 --> 09:44.734
Will you be my Queen?

09:45.305 --> 09:47.103
No!

09:47.574 --> 09:50.168
- Yes.
- Yes, yeah!

09:57.750 --> 09:58.774
Oh, my...

10:03.923 --> 10:05.413
- I am so sorry.
- It's okay.

10:05.592 --> 10:06.582
I'm so sorry.

10:10.263 --> 10:11.560
Yeah!

10:14.267 --> 10:15.860
Makes our movie nights
seem a little tame.

10:16.069 --> 10:17.332
I love y...

10:18.271 --> 10:19.329
Movies.

10:20.039 --> 10:21.029
Me too.

10:21.674 --> 10:22.664
Yeah.

10:31.151 --> 10:34.018
A lifetime of plans, gone.

10:36.322 --> 10:38.723
Our family status, gone.

10:39.692 --> 10:41.854
Audrey, you were supposed
to be his Queen,

10:42.228 --> 10:44.356
and you let him slip
through your fingers.

10:44.898 --> 10:48.232
Your mother could hold
onto a prince in her sleep.

10:48.468 --> 10:50.630
Don't you think I feel
bad enough already, Grammy?

10:51.070 --> 10:53.198
Ben and Mal
are the best. I'm so excited

10:53.339 --> 10:54.534
for Mal to be our Queen.

10:54.707 --> 10:57.039
You'd really rather have a V.K.
on the throne than me?

10:58.344 --> 10:59.903
What is wrong with you, people?

11:04.751 --> 11:06.446
What is wrong with everybody?

11:07.353 --> 11:08.821
I'm engaged, man.

11:10.356 --> 11:12.825
- What, did you know?
- Everything.

11:13.393 --> 11:15.088
You are going to rock
that crown.

11:16.162 --> 11:18.062
Okay. So I've only done
about 1,000 sketches

11:18.198 --> 11:20.963
of your wedding dress,
and Belle's already planned

11:21.101 --> 11:22.330
an engagement party next week.

11:22.469 --> 11:24.335
Well, it's a really good thing
I said yes.

11:24.737 --> 11:26.899
- Hugs. Hi.
- Hugs. Hi.

11:27.674 --> 11:30.075
- I finally get a daughter.
- Congrats, Son.

11:30.410 --> 11:31.969
- Thanks, Dad.
- I love you, Belle.

11:32.245 --> 11:34.805
- Aw, I love you.
- Oh, sweetie.

11:35.448 --> 11:36.973
I'm so happy for you both.

11:37.217 --> 11:38.742
Thank you so much,
Fairy Godmother.

11:39.185 --> 11:41.916
- I think she liked it.
- Bippity-boppity, you betcha.

11:42.922 --> 11:47.689
- All bow to Her Royal Majesty.
- Oh, yes, her Royal Purple-ness.

11:48.128 --> 11:49.653
Silence, you annoying peasants.

11:49.996 --> 11:51.896
- As you wish, my liege.
- Your Crankiness.

11:53.199 --> 11:55.258
Congratulations.

11:55.602 --> 11:58.162
You won him fair and square.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.674
Oh, wait, no, you didn't.

12:01.975 --> 12:03.909
You spelled Ben to destroy
all of Auradon.

12:05.612 --> 12:07.478
Touching story
for the grandkids.

12:08.681 --> 12:10.410
Okay. Let's do this.

12:11.818 --> 12:15.482
Speaking of kids, we have
some kids waiting on us. So...

12:16.322 --> 12:17.790
if you'll excuse me.

12:29.169 --> 12:30.864
Congratulations, m'lady Mal.

12:31.271 --> 12:33.330
- Thank you.
- Your Majesty.

12:51.091 --> 12:52.320
I have so much to show you.

12:52.459 --> 12:54.427
- All right, boys.
- Let's hit the road.

12:54.627 --> 12:56.220
You're gonna see him soon, okay?
Come on.

12:58.665 --> 13:01.032
- Do you have everything?
- Yes, I have everything.

13:01.267 --> 13:03.429
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure, Granny.

13:03.770 --> 13:06.068
- Oh, really?
- My glue gun.

13:06.773 --> 13:08.673
I don't know what you're going
to do without me.

13:09.943 --> 13:11.274
I'll miss you.

13:13.847 --> 13:15.144
Go on, go on.

13:18.418 --> 13:19.647
Goodbye, Granny.

13:24.057 --> 13:25.923
Here, let me help get
this off of you.

13:26.726 --> 13:28.524
- Oh.
- Okay.

13:29.696 --> 13:31.323
Let's go and do this.

13:49.382 --> 13:50.781
So, as soon as we get
to Auradon,

13:50.917 --> 13:52.248
you have to try ice cream.

13:52.585 --> 13:53.950
- And go swimming?
- I can take you

13:54.087 --> 13:56.055
to the Enchanted Lake.

13:56.422 --> 13:58.083
I can't believe I get to live
with you

13:58.224 --> 13:59.817
in your very own castle.

14:00.059 --> 14:01.549
It's just
a little starter castle.

14:02.796 --> 14:04.992
Great grip. You play sports?

14:05.665 --> 14:06.655
Here.

14:08.802 --> 14:09.792
Go on.

14:11.271 --> 14:12.466
Trust me on this.

14:17.477 --> 14:18.467
I know.

14:19.212 --> 14:20.680
Dig in, dig in.

14:29.989 --> 14:32.515
You're going to be a wise
and brave King.

14:33.393 --> 14:35.487
- He already is.
- See?

14:36.196 --> 14:37.595
The cards never lie.

14:48.575 --> 14:51.135
The only reason they should be
opening that barrier

14:51.277 --> 14:52.870
is for putting Uma back in,

14:53.246 --> 14:55.305
not letting more villains out.

15:09.762 --> 15:10.854
It's Hades.

15:11.397 --> 15:13.058
Stop the car.
He's trying to escape.

15:18.071 --> 15:19.766
I am a god.

15:20.240 --> 15:22.208
I don't belong here.

15:54.707 --> 15:56.869
Do not panic, okay?
Nobody needs...

15:57.043 --> 15:58.340
- It's Ben.
- ...to panic

16:00.013 --> 16:02.311
There's your precious Queen.
She can't even protect us.

16:02.482 --> 16:05.008
Okay. We're panicking.
Bippity-boppity run.

16:11.724 --> 16:13.123
Come on, Mal, blast him.

16:33.713 --> 16:34.908
Are you okay?

16:53.333 --> 16:55.062
- Are you okay?
- No.

16:55.769 --> 16:57.533
He was draining all of my magic
with the ember,

16:57.704 --> 17:00.139
and I felt all of my powers
slipping away.

17:00.373 --> 17:01.670
You're safe.

17:02.208 --> 17:03.437
He's back where he belongs.

17:07.814 --> 17:09.339
Yeah, for now.

17:11.384 --> 17:13.147
- We should go.
- Okay.

17:22.395 --> 17:25.194
<i>A lifetime of plans,
gone.</i>

17:26.031 --> 17:29.969
<i>Your mother could hold
onto a prince in her sleep.</i>

17:40.213 --> 17:42.113
I'm so tired of pretending.

17:43.116 --> 17:44.606
Where's my happy ending?

17:45.985 --> 17:48.647
<i>I followed all the rules
I drew inside the lines</i>

17:48.888 --> 17:50.947
<i>I never asked for anything
That wasn't mine</i>

17:51.191 --> 17:54.161
<i>I waited patiently for my time
But when it finally came</i>

17:54.461 --> 17:55.860
<i>He called her name</i>

17:56.096 --> 17:58.064
<i>And now I feel
This overwhelming pain</i>

17:58.164 --> 18:00.565
<i>I mean, it's in my veins
I mean, it's in my brain</i>

18:00.800 --> 18:03.394
<i>My thoughts are running
In a circle like a toy train</i>

18:03.503 --> 18:05.096
<i>I'm kind of like
a perfect picture</i>

18:05.171 --> 18:07.936
<i>With a broken frame
I know exactly who to blame</i>

18:09.008 --> 18:12.103
<i>I never thought
Of myself as mean</i>

18:14.514 --> 18:17.609
<i>I always thought
That I'd be the Queen</i>

18:18.051 --> 18:21.544
<i>And there's no in between
Because if I can't have that</i>

18:21.788 --> 18:24.553
<i>Then I would be the leader
Of the dark and the bad</i>

18:24.824 --> 18:26.314
<i>Now there's a devil
On my shoulder</i>

18:26.493 --> 18:31.021
<i>Where the angels used to be
And he's calling me the Queen</i>

18:51.985 --> 18:53.851
<i>Being nice was my past time</i>

18:54.821 --> 18:56.949
<i>But I've been hurt
For the last time</i>

18:57.323 --> 18:58.984
<i>And I won't ever let
Another person</i>

18:59.292 --> 19:00.418
<i>Take advantage of me</i>

19:00.560 --> 19:02.858
<i>The anger bums my skin
Third degree</i>

19:03.029 --> 19:05.521
<i>Now my blood's boiling hotter
Than a fiery sea</i>

19:05.832 --> 19:07.493
<i>There's nobody
Getting close to me</i>

19:07.700 --> 19:09.634
<i>They're gonna bow
To the Evil Queen</i>

19:09.903 --> 19:11.302
<i>Your nightmare is my dream</i>

19:11.538 --> 19:14.235
<i>Just wait until they fall
To my wicked schemes</i>

19:15.241 --> 19:18.176
<i>I never thought of myself
As mean</i>

19:20.814 --> 19:23.840
<i>I always thought
That I'd be the Queen</i>

19:24.350 --> 19:27.843
<i>And that's no in between
Because if I can't have that</i>

19:28.087 --> 19:30.852
<i>Then I would be the leader
Of the dark and the bad</i>

19:31.090 --> 19:32.580
<i>Now there's a devil
On my shoulder</i>

19:32.726 --> 19:34.558
<i>Where the angels used to be</i>

19:34.794 --> 19:37.491
<i>And he's calling me
The Queen of Mean</i>

19:37.831 --> 19:40.266
- <i>Calling me, calling me</i>
- <i>The Queen of Mean</i>

19:40.600 --> 19:41.965
<i>Calling me, calling me</i>

19:43.236 --> 19:45.364
- <i>Calling me, calling me</i>
- <i>The Queen of Mean</i>

19:45.638 --> 19:47.231
<i>Audrey!</i>

19:47.540 --> 19:50.009
<i>Something's pulling me
It's so magnetic</i>

19:50.176 --> 19:52.770
<i>My body is moving
Unsure where I'm headed</i>

19:53.113 --> 19:55.275
<i>All of my senses
Have left me defenseless</i>

19:55.682 --> 19:58.344
<i>This darkness around me
Is promising vengeance</i>

19:58.518 --> 20:00.987
<i>The price that I'm willing
To pay is expensive</i>

20:01.187 --> 20:03.554
<i>There's nothing to lose
When you're lonely and friendless</i>

20:03.990 --> 20:06.516
<i>So my only interest
Is showing this princess</i>

20:06.659 --> 20:09.822
<i>That I am the Queen
And my reign will be endless</i>

20:11.197 --> 20:16.567
<i>I want what I deserve
I wanna rule the world</i>

20:16.903 --> 20:20.100
<i>Sit back and watch them learn</i>

20:20.440 --> 20:24.206
<i>It's finally my turn</i>

20:24.477 --> 20:26.969
<i>If they want a villain
For a Queen</i>

20:29.582 --> 20:32.574
<i>I'm gonna be one that
They've never seen</i>

20:33.286 --> 20:36.916
<i>I'll show them what it means
Now that I am that</i>

20:37.190 --> 20:39.818
<i>I will be the ruler
Of the dark and the bad</i>

20:40.226 --> 20:41.591
<i>Because the devil's
On my shoulder</i>

20:41.728 --> 20:43.423
<i>Where the angels used to be</i>

20:43.696 --> 20:46.495
<i>And he's calling me
The Queen of Mean</i>

20:46.666 --> 20:48.566
<i>Calling me, calling me</i>

20:49.536 --> 20:51.937
- <i>Calling me, calling me</i>
- <i>The Queen of Mean</i>

20:52.138 --> 20:54.300
<i>Calling me, calling me</i>

20:55.308 --> 20:58.539
<i>I want what I deserve</i>

21:03.249 --> 21:04.910
<i>I think we all know
why we're here.</i>

21:07.487 --> 21:09.387
The people are in a panic
about Hades.

21:09.522 --> 21:10.648
He almost got out.

21:11.157 --> 21:13.057
Who knows what he would've done
if he had escaped?

21:13.326 --> 21:15.988
We can't risk having
another villain on the loose.

21:16.629 --> 21:18.256
I really feel like
this is my fault.

21:19.799 --> 21:21.233
I'm supposed to protect Auradon.

21:21.434 --> 21:23.425
You did, you do protect Auradon.

21:23.837 --> 21:27.102
Every time we open the barrier,
we're exposed to danger.

21:27.807 --> 21:30.640
Maleficent, Uma, Hades.

21:40.253 --> 21:41.584
Maleficent's scepter
and the queen's crown

21:41.721 --> 21:43.416
have been stolen.

21:43.890 --> 21:45.449
- Uma?
- We don't know that, Dad.

21:45.992 --> 21:47.289
When the people hear this,
they will never

21:47.494 --> 21:48.620
wanna leave their houses.

21:49.896 --> 21:51.193
What do we tell them?

21:53.533 --> 21:54.523
Mal?

21:55.802 --> 21:56.894
What do we do?

21:57.337 --> 21:59.169
How do we keep evil
out of Auradon?

22:04.310 --> 22:05.937
I think that there's only...

22:07.280 --> 22:10.045
one way
to guarantee their safety.

22:12.051 --> 22:14.520
And I think that there...

22:17.857 --> 22:19.621
can't be anymore going
in and out.

22:23.196 --> 22:25.290
I think that we have to close
the barrier...

22:26.633 --> 22:27.657
forever.

22:32.505 --> 22:33.768
- No.
- Son.

22:34.407 --> 22:35.431
- No.
- Ben.

22:35.608 --> 22:37.007
- No, no, no, no.
- Ben.

22:38.178 --> 22:39.202
Hey.

22:39.879 --> 22:42.974
I do not want to take away
your dream.

22:43.883 --> 22:45.681
Because it was so beautiful.

22:46.786 --> 22:49.619
And it is why
I fell in love with you.

22:51.424 --> 22:54.257
But as King, and as Queen...

22:55.328 --> 22:56.693
what's our duty?

22:57.731 --> 22:59.165
To protect Auradon.

23:01.634 --> 23:03.398
But do you know
what would this mean?

23:04.804 --> 23:05.999
All those kids?

23:08.842 --> 23:12.073
- Are you prepared for that?
- I know what it means...

23:13.480 --> 23:17.348
and no, I'm not prepared for it.

23:19.385 --> 23:22.446
I just think that we have
no other choice.

23:25.658 --> 23:26.523
Son?

23:29.095 --> 23:30.062
Mal's right.

23:30.830 --> 23:32.525
I just don't think that we would
forgive ourselves

23:32.665 --> 23:34.224
if something terrible happened.

23:41.808 --> 23:43.867
Who else knows
about the crown and the scepter?

23:44.144 --> 23:45.168
No one.

23:45.645 --> 23:46.840
I mean, think about it,

23:46.980 --> 23:48.345
people are scared enough
as it is.

23:48.481 --> 23:51.212
We have to employ these
entirely new security measures.

23:51.451 --> 23:53.249
Will this delay
our bringing over more V.K.'s?

23:53.553 --> 23:55.453
We're talking about closing
the barrier for good.

23:55.655 --> 23:56.747
But you said no.

23:59.092 --> 24:00.821
I mean, the four of us
are living the dream here,

24:00.894 --> 24:02.419
and we finally
get to share that.

24:03.096 --> 24:04.894
I mean, what could be
more important than that?

24:05.231 --> 24:06.221
Yeah.

24:07.400 --> 24:08.561
I know.

24:11.905 --> 24:15.307
I mean, maybe security or maybe
peace of mind

24:15.508 --> 24:17.738
- for everyone in Auradon.
- Is that what they're thinking?

24:18.945 --> 24:21.505
And were they seriously thinking
that no one will ever go

24:21.648 --> 24:23.639
in or out
of the Isle ever again?

24:24.250 --> 24:27.049
What, we never get to go back
and see our parents?

24:28.354 --> 24:29.719
And what about these kids?

24:29.956 --> 24:31.481
We promised them that they could
go back

24:31.658 --> 24:32.921
and visit whenever they wanted.

24:33.426 --> 24:34.518
Yeah, I know.

24:35.061 --> 24:37.359
M., I am so glad
that you are going to be Queen.

24:37.664 --> 24:39.291
You will be a part
of these conversations,

24:39.432 --> 24:41.093
you will stand up
for the V.K.s.

24:42.936 --> 24:44.165
Thank you for telling me.

24:49.409 --> 24:50.706
You're gonna be a great Queen.

24:54.347 --> 24:56.338
- Morning. Got the beach towels.
- Sorry. Morning.

24:56.783 --> 24:57.716
- These.
- Hey.

24:57.951 --> 24:59.510
I really think she's gonna like
the cake, you guys.

24:59.686 --> 25:01.051
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, no.

25:02.288 --> 25:04.916
Okay. Who got into Jane's cake?

25:10.764 --> 25:11.925
Delicious.

25:12.332 --> 25:14.596
I especially love
the lack of dirt.

25:17.036 --> 25:18.595
And the lack of flies.

25:24.244 --> 25:26.713
- Want some?
- Thank you.

25:38.258 --> 25:39.726
I was hoping you were home.

25:42.896 --> 25:44.091
Is this a joke?

25:44.531 --> 25:46.431
What are you doing
with the crown and the scepter?

25:46.699 --> 25:48.895
Well, I wanted them,
so I took them.

25:50.070 --> 25:52.505
And you, of all people
should understand that, Mal.

25:53.506 --> 25:56.407
Wait, Audrey, stop!
Don't use that.

25:57.710 --> 25:58.836
I thought you liked spells.

26:02.916 --> 26:04.907
- Okay, Audrey, you're better...
- Quiet!

26:05.585 --> 26:09.078
- It's not a toy. It's dangerous.
- I want to be dangerous.

26:10.723 --> 26:12.657
My life was perfect
until you stole it.

26:14.160 --> 26:16.322
And then Auradon
turned its back on me.

26:19.999 --> 26:21.524
Well, it's time
for a little payback.

26:21.734 --> 26:23.293
Audrey, wait!

26:34.047 --> 26:36.573
You think Ben will love you now,
you old hag?

26:37.317 --> 26:39.081
You'll pay the price
of what you did and so will

26:39.219 --> 26:40.186
all of Auradon.

26:42.088 --> 26:43.180
So long, suckers!

26:47.727 --> 26:50.753
Whoa! You might wanna think
of a spell for that.

26:51.231 --> 26:52.824
There's no spell
that can reverse

26:52.966 --> 26:54.400
the curse of the scepter.

26:54.634 --> 26:56.966
- Well, that's a shame.
- Forget about me.

26:57.370 --> 27:01.170
Audrey's out for revenge.
And all of Auradon is in danger.

27:01.374 --> 27:02.273
What should we do?

27:03.076 --> 27:05.340
The only thing more powerful
than the scepter...

27:06.112 --> 27:07.443
- is Hades' ember.
- Oh!

27:07.781 --> 27:09.374
Like he's just gonna hand
it over, give them back

27:09.516 --> 27:10.608
- to the Isle.
- And no one knows

27:10.750 --> 27:12.218
- where his lair is.
- I do.

27:12.519 --> 27:14.613
I'm his errand rat.
I've got the key at my dad's.

27:15.021 --> 27:16.386
You are coming.

27:16.790 --> 27:17.985
But I just got here.

27:18.525 --> 27:19.515
Mal?

27:22.028 --> 27:23.462
Dizzy, stay here to take care
of the twins.

27:23.596 --> 27:25.587
We'll be right back
and everything will be just fine.

27:25.799 --> 27:27.289
Go inside.
Guys, go get your stuff.

27:27.434 --> 27:28.765
Come on, boys, let's go.

27:29.903 --> 27:30.961
How bad is it?

27:34.340 --> 27:36.274
You age beautifully.

27:37.210 --> 27:39.406
Now, let's just get you
into something fabulous.

27:39.646 --> 27:40.636
- Okay.
- Come on.

27:45.752 --> 27:46.742
Okay.

27:47.754 --> 27:49.745
- Oh, yeah, there we go.
- Okay.

27:50.190 --> 27:51.487
Almost there.

28:05.772 --> 28:10.710
Noble steed, proud and fair,
you shall take us anywhere.

28:20.487 --> 28:22.854
Carlos, you're gonna miss
Jane's birthday.

28:39.372 --> 28:41.272
Oh.

28:42.308 --> 28:44.276
Looks like Carlos forgot
about your birthday, huh?

28:45.311 --> 28:47.245
Well, maybe not, maybe he just
took the wrong trail

28:47.313 --> 28:49.475
or something. Or you know what?

28:49.783 --> 28:50.909
They probably
don't celebrate birthdays

28:51.051 --> 28:52.849
on the Isle, maybe it's like
a cultural thing.

28:53.153 --> 28:54.245
Oh, yeah.

28:55.054 --> 28:57.216
Or maybe he just forgot.
You never know.

28:57.557 --> 28:59.855
Hey, Chad, look!
There's people taking selfies.

29:00.460 --> 29:02.155
Selfies! Guys,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

29:02.462 --> 29:04.590
Wait for me! Wait for me!

29:05.498 --> 29:06.897
Why is she here?

29:07.433 --> 29:09.197
Did anybody save me
any guacamole?

29:10.737 --> 29:11.636
No?

29:13.206 --> 29:14.833
It's like someone forgot
to invite me.

29:15.408 --> 29:19.174
Well, don't be expecting Mal,
she's...

29:21.114 --> 29:22.377
not feeling herself.

29:24.717 --> 29:26.185
Does that make you sad?

29:27.287 --> 29:28.448
Does it just ruin everything?

29:29.322 --> 29:30.790
Mindless little drones.

29:32.058 --> 29:33.753
How could you forget
what she did to us?

29:33.927 --> 29:36.419
How could you forget that
I was supposed to be your Queen?

29:36.596 --> 29:38.655
Time out, okay, okay. Time out.

29:39.532 --> 29:42.558
First off, great new look.
I absolutely love feathers.

29:43.036 --> 29:44.697
But, hey, before you do
whatever you're gonna do,

29:44.871 --> 29:46.430
I was wondering if maybe you
wanted a...

29:47.207 --> 29:48.868
loyal boyfriend by your side?

29:49.476 --> 29:50.500
Partner in crime?

29:51.211 --> 29:52.201
Sidekick?

29:53.046 --> 29:55.708
Or maybe just a lackey
to do your bidding, um,

29:56.082 --> 29:58.210
change tires. Or smoothie runs?

29:59.719 --> 30:01.585
- Please?
- You can be useful.

30:02.055 --> 30:03.750
- Yeah?
- Fine. Stand behind me.

30:04.023 --> 30:05.286
Okay.

30:05.625 --> 30:08.788
Auradon likes to forget so much.
They'll love this.

30:11.097 --> 30:16.126
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

30:16.603 --> 30:22.736
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

30:23.243 --> 30:29.273
<i>Happy birthday to Jane</i>

30:31.718 --> 30:34.881
<i>Happy birthday</i>

30:35.088 --> 30:38.319
<i>To you</i>

30:40.527 --> 30:41.995
The Enchanted Lake.

30:45.832 --> 30:46.822
Audrey.

30:50.070 --> 30:51.697
Sweet dreams.

31:14.828 --> 31:16.762
Hey, Jane.
I'm on my way to the party.

31:16.963 --> 31:18.362
- My meetings ran long.
- No, no.

31:18.498 --> 31:20.159
Stay where you are, Ben.
Audrey's got the scepter

31:20.300 --> 31:21.392
and everyone's asleep.

31:21.601 --> 31:23.797
I'm gonna call Mom
and tell her to get her wand.

31:24.604 --> 31:25.867
Is Mal with you?

31:26.773 --> 31:28.901
Jane? Jane?

31:50.864 --> 31:53.424
Hey. I'm me again.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.866
Duh. Evil magic
doesn't work here.

31:56.236 --> 31:57.670
Kind of the point.

31:58.571 --> 32:01.404
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

32:27.734 --> 32:28.826
- Hey.
- Daddy.

32:29.002 --> 32:31.437
Here she is.

32:31.771 --> 32:34.604
Come on. And.. And...
Ho!

32:37.010 --> 32:39.411
Hey, yeah.
Come here little rascal.

32:40.513 --> 32:41.708
Ah!

32:42.549 --> 32:45.849
So, what kind of hustle
you got going on with them

32:46.086 --> 32:47.884
- shiny people?
- No hustle.

32:48.121 --> 32:49.782
I got friends on the other side.

32:50.090 --> 32:53.116
Ah! I hear you. I hear you.

32:54.160 --> 32:55.150
We're on a mission.

32:56.229 --> 33:00.166
I'm kind of a major player
so that's why I can't stay long.

33:00.967 --> 33:03.026
You make sure you get your cut.

33:11.344 --> 33:12.971
<i>Alerts of the sleeping spell</i>

33:13.046 --> 33:15.276
<i>keep coming in as it spreads
throughout Auradon.</i>

33:15.548 --> 33:17.812
Uh. guys. Come look at this.

33:18.218 --> 33:20.152
<i>There are rumors
that Sleeping Beauty's daughter,</i>

33:20.320 --> 33:22.516
<i>Audrey, is behind the spell.
We're trying to discover</i>

33:22.722 --> 33:24.781
<i>who is responsible
for these vicious lies,</i>

33:25.058 --> 33:27.288
<i>and which villain
has perpetrated this evil.</i>

33:27.560 --> 33:29.722
<i>We have an update. It's what?</i>

33:29.896 --> 33:32.866
<i>It's moving this way?
It is moving this way.</i>

33:35.034 --> 33:38.698
- Wow! Rookie mistake?
- Long time nay see.

33:39.205 --> 33:42.038
- Get off my bike, Hook.
- Catch me if you can, Jay.

33:44.778 --> 33:46.007
- Over the roofs.
- Cut them off.

33:46.146 --> 33:48.274
- Yup.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, not you.

33:48.715 --> 33:51.116
They got this. You and me
gotta go find the ember.

33:51.484 --> 33:53.509
Good timing.
It's right about his nap time.

34:08.333 --> 34:09.324
Hey.

34:11.404 --> 34:12.838
How big is that dog?

34:15.342 --> 34:16.400
You'll see.

34:24.451 --> 34:27.944
Okay, stay quiet.
It echoes, like, crazy in here.

34:40.800 --> 34:42.598
Come on. Come, come.

36:33.546 --> 36:35.105
What are you doing here?

36:38.451 --> 36:42.820
I noticed you were low
on canned corn.

36:56.736 --> 36:57.828
Hi, Dad.

37:05.045 --> 37:07.537
Quite a show
you put on the other day.

37:08.281 --> 37:09.578
Right back at you.

37:10.050 --> 37:11.142
Hmm.

37:11.851 --> 37:14.149
I was just coming to see you.

37:15.054 --> 37:17.580
Really? Wonder why.

37:18.325 --> 37:19.656
Is it because I'm gonna
be Queen?

37:19.893 --> 37:21.122
Ah!

37:21.227 --> 37:23.321
Now, Mal, don't be bitter.

37:25.432 --> 37:27.867
You abandoned me
when I was a baby.

37:28.134 --> 37:31.126
No. No, I left your mother.

37:32.505 --> 37:36.874
She's not the easiest person
to get along with.

37:37.510 --> 37:39.501
- You think?
- Huh. You see?

37:40.180 --> 37:41.648
We have something
in common already.

37:42.148 --> 37:43.912
- We both hate your mother.
- No.

37:45.218 --> 37:46.617
I don't hate my mother.

37:47.787 --> 37:50.950
She may be an evil lunatic,
but at least she stuck around.

37:51.224 --> 37:53.454
Oh! Boo-hoo.

37:54.160 --> 37:56.094
Wake up and smell the stink.

37:56.796 --> 38:00.357
You think you've had it rough?
I used to be a god!

38:00.900 --> 38:04.302
I had an entire world
which bore my name.

38:04.637 --> 38:07.163
And now I have nothing!

38:07.607 --> 38:09.632
And you have no idea
what that feels like.

38:09.809 --> 38:14.303
Really? Because for 16 years,
I had nothing.

38:15.982 --> 38:18.349
And now, I have a whole world.

38:19.919 --> 38:23.082
But unless I get that ember,
it's game over.

38:29.929 --> 38:31.021
Hold, please.

38:38.171 --> 38:41.402
<i>Listen little girl
You're talking to a god</i>

38:41.841 --> 38:45.072
<i>And I don't wanna hear
The drama</i>

38:45.311 --> 38:48.542
- <i>Kindness ain't my brand</i>
- <i>Oh, I guess that's why you ran</i>

38:48.782 --> 38:52.116
<i>Try being married to your mama</i>

38:52.352 --> 38:55.549
- <i>You stink at being a dad</i>
- <i>Poor, Mali, are you sad?</i>

38:55.755 --> 38:59.157
<i>Not as sad as you
Without your powers</i>

38:59.392 --> 39:02.760
<i>I didn't come to fight
For once do something right</i>

39:03.029 --> 39:06.329
<i>I steal souls
Were you expecting flowers?</i>

39:07.033 --> 39:08.865
<i>I only need you
'Cause I came here</i>

39:09.069 --> 39:11.697
- <i>for something</i>
- <i>I've given you everything</i>

39:11.871 --> 39:13.771
- <i>By giving you nothing</i>
- <i>By giving me nothing</i>

39:13.873 --> 39:16.968
- <i>I did what I had to do</i>
- <i>Ooh</i>

39:17.210 --> 39:20.510
<i>No, you only did
What's best for you</i>

39:20.714 --> 39:23.775
<i>Well you can learn
A thing or two</i>

39:24.250 --> 39:26.685
<i>When push comes to shove
You do</i>

39:26.953 --> 39:29.684
<i>What you've gotta do, yeah</i>

39:31.424 --> 39:34.917
<i>You were never there
I guess you don't have a phone</i>

39:35.095 --> 39:38.429
<i>You never called to say
"I miss you"</i>

39:38.632 --> 39:40.157
<i>Are you kidding?
Is this a joke?</i>

39:40.367 --> 39:41.698
<i>You need to let it go</i>

39:42.035 --> 39:45.528
- <i>You're stronger with those daddy issues</i>
- <i>Oh, thank you</i>

39:45.839 --> 39:48.900
<i>Show me some respect
It ain't easy to neglect</i>

39:49.142 --> 39:52.305
<i>My attention
Would've made you softer</i>

39:53.346 --> 39:56.179
<i>Should I be proud?
Don't turn this thing around</i>

39:56.383 --> 39:59.045
<i>I guess you are
Your father's daughter</i>

40:00.387 --> 40:03.220
<i>Don't think I need you
I just came here for something</i>

40:03.490 --> 40:04.980
<i>I've given you everything</i>

40:05.125 --> 40:07.150
- <i>By giving you nothing</i>
- <i>By giving me nothing</i>

40:07.394 --> 40:10.295
- <i>And I did what I had to do</i>
- <i>Ooh</i>

40:10.563 --> 40:13.794
<i>I made it on my own
No thanks to you</i>

40:13.933 --> 40:16.868
<i>Well you could learn
A thing or two</i>

40:17.604 --> 40:21.507
<i>When push comes to shove
You do what you gotta do</i>

40:21.808 --> 40:24.869
<i>How about I go with you
And we'll spend some time?</i>

40:25.245 --> 40:28.476
<i>How about you stay here
'Cause you're out of your mind</i>

40:28.882 --> 40:31.749
<i>Let's make new memories
You can show me the town</i>

40:31.951 --> 40:34.613
<i>No you can keep
Your memories now</i>

40:34.754 --> 40:37.121
- <i>Get over it</i>
- <i>I am over it</i>

40:37.691 --> 40:40.023
<i>I'm over you being over it</i>

40:40.693 --> 40:41.819
<i>Let's dance</i>

40:54.874 --> 40:57.502
<i>I did What I had to do</i>

40:58.778 --> 41:01.748
<i>No you only did
What's best for you</i>

41:01.915 --> 41:04.885
<i>Well you can learn
A thing or two</i>

41:05.552 --> 41:08.283
<i>When push comes to shove
You do</i>

41:08.989 --> 41:12.254
<i>When push comes to shove
You do</i>

41:12.625 --> 41:16.687
<i>When push comes to shove
You do</i>

41:17.097 --> 41:19.759
<i>What you gotta do</i>

41:19.933 --> 41:21.196
<i>Yeah</i>

41:22.202 --> 41:23.761
Please...

41:27.841 --> 41:30.003
Do you wanna make up
for being a lousy dad?

41:32.679 --> 41:35.410
- Give me the ember.
- The ember only works for me.

41:35.649 --> 41:37.708
No. It'll work for me.
We're blood.

41:39.652 --> 41:41.177
You're only half Hades.

41:41.821 --> 41:44.085
The ember won't do everything
for you that it does for me.

41:44.391 --> 41:45.654
I'll take my chances.

41:54.300 --> 41:56.325
If it gets wet, it's game over.

42:05.044 --> 42:07.672
That's my girl.

42:12.886 --> 42:14.445
I guess that's the reason
why he's always

42:14.587 --> 42:15.850
asking about you.

42:20.960 --> 42:26.160
Evie is the only one
who knows that he's my dad.

42:27.968 --> 42:32.166
And as far as I'm concerned,
he doesn't even exist.

42:42.649 --> 42:45.744
No. No, I want the Auradon guard
handing out gas masks.

42:46.486 --> 42:47.954
Well, not everyone's asleep.

42:49.823 --> 42:51.416
Find out if anyone
has seen Audrey.

42:51.925 --> 42:53.950
And find out if she has
a list of demands.

43:06.406 --> 43:07.874
Just one.

43:08.842 --> 43:10.105
I demand my life back.

43:12.946 --> 43:14.436
I have a proposition.

43:15.648 --> 43:17.275
I'll wake everybody up
right now...

43:19.252 --> 43:20.276
under one...

43:21.388 --> 43:24.619
itty-bitty condition, Benny-boo.

43:28.862 --> 43:31.354
Make me your Queen,
and we'll rule side by side.

43:36.970 --> 43:38.495
Did someone put a spell on you?

43:40.774 --> 43:42.299
- Just tell me who and...
- You'll what?

43:42.876 --> 43:45.811
Marry them?

43:47.314 --> 43:49.612
Most people get dumped
because they aren't good enough.

43:50.817 --> 43:52.148
I wasn't bad enough.

43:54.521 --> 43:56.990
How do you like me now,
Benny-boo?

43:58.124 --> 43:59.649
I like the old Audrey better.

44:02.062 --> 44:03.655
She wouldn't wanna hurt Auradon.

44:07.434 --> 44:10.665
Just give me the scepter,
and I'll forgive you.

44:11.905 --> 44:12.872
You'll forgive me?

44:15.208 --> 44:16.369
I don't think so.

44:17.811 --> 44:19.210
Sleeping is too good for you.

44:21.381 --> 44:23.110
Sleeping is too good
for Auradon.

44:37.263 --> 44:39.459
All right.
Get in, get out.

44:39.633 --> 44:40.657
- Jay, you're good?
- Yeah.

44:40.834 --> 44:41.926
Okay. Hold on.

44:50.844 --> 44:52.676
Whoa. You got a little
Hades thing going.

44:52.879 --> 44:54.369
- Wow.
- That thing packs a punch, huh?

44:59.052 --> 45:00.986
- We made it, bro.
- We made it.

45:02.989 --> 45:05.287
Hey, guys. We're just coming
for a wee visit.

45:08.094 --> 45:10.495
Come on. Hey. Hey.

45:13.833 --> 45:14.857
No!

45:25.011 --> 45:26.137
Drop something?

45:26.980 --> 45:29.005
It can't get wet.
Give it back before it goes out.

45:30.950 --> 45:32.042
- Uma?
- Uma?

45:32.218 --> 45:33.481
That's my name.

45:39.159 --> 45:40.058
No!

45:53.840 --> 45:55.103
Hi, boys.

45:57.577 --> 46:01.036
Welcome back.

46:01.581 --> 46:04.551
Uma, you swam off
and forgot all about us.

46:04.751 --> 46:06.480
Yeah. Planning her revenge,
no doubt.

46:06.553 --> 46:08.385
It's not all about you, Mal.

46:09.389 --> 46:11.118
I was looking for a hole
in the barrier

46:11.291 --> 46:12.281
to let everybody out.

46:12.759 --> 46:14.124
And you know what I found, boys?

46:14.561 --> 46:16.290
It's way better out there
than we thought.

46:16.930 --> 46:18.830
There's this thing
that looks like a furry rock

46:19.099 --> 46:21.124
called a coconut.
And fish so big

46:21.267 --> 46:23.065
you could dance on their backs.

46:24.671 --> 46:26.901
And they've been keeping it all
for themselves.

46:27.340 --> 46:30.139
Whatever. Uma, I need that
to break a spell.

46:30.343 --> 46:32.209
Cast by Audrey,
Sleeping Beauty's daughter.

46:32.879 --> 46:35.576
Mm. So the good guy
is the bad guy?

46:36.850 --> 46:39.649
Well, I might not give it back.
Let's see what happens.

46:39.953 --> 46:41.478
Uma, it's not the time
for games!

46:41.688 --> 46:43.713
People's lives are in danger!

46:45.759 --> 46:49.195
Guarantee me that every single
villain kid who wants to,

46:49.796 --> 46:52.197
- can get off the isle.
- I can't do that.

46:52.699 --> 46:53.860
Can't do that?

46:54.067 --> 46:56.934
- Well, how about now?
- Deal. Deal.

46:57.404 --> 46:58.872
Uma!

47:01.775 --> 47:02.867
Her word is good.

47:08.882 --> 47:11.146
I'll still keep this,
for the time being.

47:12.819 --> 47:15.413
Because if you think I trust you
to save the world on your own,

47:15.789 --> 47:16.756
think again.

47:18.892 --> 47:21.520
- This is a job for pirates.
- Yeah.

47:22.529 --> 47:25.123
We can always go back to hating
each other when this is over.

47:29.102 --> 47:30.092
Fine.

47:32.072 --> 47:35.406
- Where are our bikes?
- Oh, yeah. We crashed them.

47:41.181 --> 47:43.548
Here's a thought.

47:45.118 --> 47:46.552
We could try to be friends.

47:47.654 --> 47:50.180
Put our history behind us
and celebrate our differences.

47:52.025 --> 47:53.049
Yeah?

47:55.395 --> 47:56.556
Who wants gum?

47:57.664 --> 47:59.530
- Let's go.
- No?

47:59.966 --> 48:01.024
Ah...

48:01.668 --> 48:03.796
No. I'm in charge.

48:04.571 --> 48:05.766
Let's go.

48:21.054 --> 48:22.044
They're asleep.

48:23.256 --> 48:24.246
Everyone.

48:25.358 --> 48:26.519
I can't get Ben.

48:27.027 --> 48:29.621
- Or Dizzy or Doug.
- Or Jane. The signal's out.

48:31.731 --> 48:32.994
Is that Auradon Prep?

48:33.266 --> 48:35.735
Yeah. When everybody wakes up,
you're going to love it.

48:37.103 --> 48:38.093
Geez.

48:38.405 --> 48:40.635
- Everything is so...
- Freaky.

48:41.541 --> 48:42.531
...green.

48:43.043 --> 48:45.011
You have leaves on your trees.

48:45.145 --> 48:47.079
And what are those
colored things on the bushes?

48:47.247 --> 48:51.013
- Uh... Flowers?
- Flowers are pretty.

48:51.718 --> 48:54.619
Cantaloupe! Mm! Mm!

48:55.188 --> 48:57.054
We don't have fresh fruit
on the Isle, remember?

48:59.225 --> 49:01.853
- Thank you.
- They're grapes.

49:02.962 --> 49:03.952
Grapes?

49:05.598 --> 49:06.929
I love grapes.

49:10.103 --> 49:13.334
I believe I deserve
some compensation

49:13.473 --> 49:19.003
for my muscles, my wile,
and my role in this endeavor.

49:20.380 --> 49:23.111
You do.
Me not squashing you like a bug.

49:25.652 --> 49:26.915
Think I'm scared of you, Jay?

49:27.253 --> 49:28.550
Guys.

49:31.224 --> 49:32.658
- Mm!
- Dude.

49:32.992 --> 49:35.120
Delicious.

49:35.328 --> 49:37.524
- Dude, really?
- What? It wasn't me, I swear.

49:37.731 --> 49:39.199
Okay. It was me.

49:39.766 --> 49:41.291
Hey, do you know
what happened here?

49:41.568 --> 49:44.333
Yup. Audrey showed up.
She put everybody to sleep.

49:44.437 --> 49:46.701
- And then she turned some of them to...
- Guys.

49:48.341 --> 49:49.570
Hannah turned to stone.

49:53.680 --> 49:55.239
All right.
Everybody stay on their toes.

49:55.348 --> 49:57.442
Look, since we're here,
let's check the school.

49:57.751 --> 49:58.741
No.

49:59.285 --> 50:00.480
Audrey went straight
for the crown,

50:00.620 --> 50:01.917
so, I think it's safe to assume

50:01.988 --> 50:03.888
that she's gonna go for Ben
and his castle next.

50:04.290 --> 50:06.520
- That's where we'll go.
- Says who?

50:07.761 --> 50:09.058
- Says me.
- Says you.

50:09.195 --> 50:10.424
And that's supposed to mean
something to me?

50:10.597 --> 50:11.723
Guys.

50:16.002 --> 50:17.128
To the castle.

50:28.782 --> 50:31.911
- How did Mal break my spell?
- I don't know.

50:32.819 --> 50:35.914
- And what is Uma doing here?
- Hey, no, no, no, no, no.

50:36.956 --> 50:38.287
Come clean, Chad.

50:40.460 --> 50:41.791
- Where did they go?
- I don't know.

50:42.062 --> 50:44.224
I don't know, okay?
I can go check for you.

50:44.364 --> 50:45.889
- How about that?
- Stay!

50:52.305 --> 50:53.932
It's about to get a little ugly.

50:59.846 --> 51:01.109
Ben!

51:01.915 --> 51:03.644
This way.

51:04.517 --> 51:07.145
- Ben could be asleep anywhere.
- Or turned to stone.

51:07.354 --> 51:08.549
Okay.

51:08.922 --> 51:10.014
Ben!

51:10.490 --> 51:12.424
I got a scent.
Very pungent cologne.

51:12.559 --> 51:14.288
Easy to track.
Follow me, people.

51:14.928 --> 51:17.727
- That's great, Dude.
- FYI, I give great cuddles, too.

51:18.731 --> 51:20.927
Really? I never had
a pet growing up.

51:21.101 --> 51:22.865
Well, except for the elk head
in Dad's man cave

51:23.002 --> 51:24.436
- but that wasn't...
- Hold up.

51:25.305 --> 51:26.466
What's this?

51:28.408 --> 51:29.466
Uh...

51:29.843 --> 51:31.607
Any chance
this was already there?

51:32.979 --> 51:34.344
And follow me.

51:38.051 --> 51:39.041
Ben!

51:40.654 --> 51:41.644
Ben!

51:45.158 --> 51:46.216
Ben!

51:47.126 --> 51:48.218
Ben!

51:49.763 --> 51:51.492
Stay here, okay?

51:56.269 --> 51:58.169
I can feel you looking.

51:59.806 --> 52:00.830
Good.

52:01.408 --> 52:03.706
So you can track,
cuddle, and talk.

52:04.110 --> 52:06.408
Hey, do you think his puppies
would be able to talk, too?

52:06.746 --> 52:10.080
All right, man. He's taken.
You want a dog, adopt a rescue.

52:10.650 --> 52:14.382
Talking puppies.
That's crazy.

52:15.088 --> 52:16.681
- Come here.
- He seems nice.

52:19.893 --> 52:22.521
I bet you lost some sleep
thinking about me on the loose?

52:23.129 --> 52:25.496
No. Dragons don't really
lose sleep.

52:26.933 --> 52:28.697
I wonder what fried octopus
tastes like.

52:28.802 --> 52:29.963
Okay. Why do we not do this?

52:30.036 --> 52:31.470
We're celebrating
our differences.

52:37.410 --> 52:39.139
I believe
we're being challenged.

52:39.346 --> 52:40.677
Let's split up
and look for Audrey.

52:40.814 --> 52:42.304
That makes absolutely no sense.

52:42.415 --> 52:44.543
Unless you give me my ember,
she's going to spell you.

52:45.185 --> 52:46.209
Girls!

52:46.719 --> 52:48.517
We have a situation here.

52:49.422 --> 52:50.787
Do you like a prince, Mal?

52:52.092 --> 52:53.617
How about a knight
in shining armor?

52:54.561 --> 52:55.551
Or knights?

53:04.270 --> 53:05.635
<i>Watch your back
Watch your back</i>

53:05.772 --> 53:07.262
<i>Watch your back
Watch your back</i>

53:07.374 --> 53:10.139
<i>We can counter their attack
Hit them till the armor cracks</i>

53:10.276 --> 53:12.802
<i>This could get a little sticky</i>

53:13.246 --> 53:15.715
<i>How to win this battle
Could be tricky</i>

53:16.149 --> 53:19.119
<i>But I know the best way
Fall back let me lead</i>

53:19.352 --> 53:21.980
<i>You hold the line and we'll
Bring them to their knees</i>

53:22.122 --> 53:24.113
<i>Swords in the air
If you're with me</i>

53:24.524 --> 53:27.721
- <i>Yeah</i>
- <i>They got us outnumbered one-to-fifty</i>

53:28.194 --> 53:30.993
<i>The victory is ours
Because I've got a strategy</i>

53:31.231 --> 53:34.166
<i>You take the left and the rest
Of you can follow me</i>

53:34.401 --> 53:37.371
- <i>This is my crew</i>
- <i>Look this is my squad</i>

53:37.537 --> 53:40.029
- <i>This is my turf</i>
- <i>Oh, my gosh</i>

53:40.573 --> 53:42.701
<i>Look guys we got bigger fish
To fry</i>

53:42.843 --> 53:44.174
<i>Put your differences aside</i>

53:44.377 --> 53:46.402
<i>'Cause now we're
on the same side</i>

53:46.513 --> 53:49.175
<i>Till the night falls
Everyone</i>

53:49.282 --> 53:52.047
<i>We'll stay together
Till the battle is done</i>

53:52.285 --> 53:53.684
<i>Watch your back
Watch your back</i>

53:53.820 --> 53:55.185
<i>Watch your back
Watch your back</i>

53:55.255 --> 53:58.054
<i>We can counter their attack
Hit them till the armor cracks</i>

53:58.291 --> 54:01.226
<i>Until the night falls
We're aligned</i>

54:01.394 --> 54:04.022
<i>It doesn't mean
That we're on the same side</i>

54:04.230 --> 54:05.698
<i>Watch your back
Watch your back</i>

54:05.765 --> 54:07.062
<i>Watch your back
Watch your back</i>

54:07.200 --> 54:08.531
<i>Hit them hard
And hit them fast</i>

54:08.702 --> 54:10.101
<i>They're too heavy to react</i>

54:10.236 --> 54:12.796
<i>The situation is getting
Kind of heavy</i>

54:12.973 --> 54:15.442
<i>Hold your weapons tight
Keep them steady</i>

54:15.975 --> 54:18.967
<i>'Cause if we stick together
We can make it out alive</i>

54:19.112 --> 54:21.945
<i>I will cause a distraction
You attack them from the side</i>

54:22.182 --> 54:24.583
<i>All my soldiers stand
at the ready</i>

54:25.151 --> 54:27.586
<i>We can cut them up
Like confetti</i>

54:28.288 --> 54:31.053
<i>We'll hit them from the front
You counter from behind</i>

54:31.357 --> 54:33.792
<i>Don't forget the fate
Of Auradon's on the line</i>

54:33.927 --> 54:36.862
<i>This is all-out war
They got us outnumbered</i>

54:37.063 --> 54:39.998
<i>The way the swords clash
Is the sound of the thunder</i>

54:40.500 --> 54:42.969
<i>And we are not going under
We will never run for cover</i>

54:43.102 --> 54:46.072
<i>We battle for the victory
And ride for each other</i>

54:46.473 --> 54:48.805
<i>Until the night falls
Everyone</i>

54:49.309 --> 54:51.937
<i>We'll stay together
Till the battle is done</i>

54:52.178 --> 54:53.612
<i>Watch your back
Watch your back</i>

54:53.747 --> 54:55.078
<i>Watch your back
Watch your back</i>

54:55.148 --> 54:58.243
<i>We can counter their attack
Hit them till the armor cracks</i>

54:58.418 --> 55:01.251
<i>Until the night falls
We're aligned</i>

55:01.388 --> 55:03.880
<i>It doesn't mean
That we're on the same side</i>

55:04.191 --> 55:05.590
<i>Watch your back
Watch your back</i>

55:05.725 --> 55:07.124
<i>Watch your back
Watch your back</i>

55:07.194 --> 55:08.787
<i>Hit them hard
And hit them fast</i>

55:08.962 --> 55:10.430
<i>They're too heavy to react</i>

55:29.649 --> 55:33.950
Suit of armor strong and true,
make this metal bust a move.

55:47.334 --> 55:48.631
No!

56:10.357 --> 56:12.985
<i>Until the night falls
You can trust</i>

56:13.226 --> 56:15.957
<i>I'm gonna help you
Win this battle because</i>

56:16.162 --> 56:17.630
<i>I got your back
Got your back</i>

56:17.764 --> 56:19.198
<i>Got your back
Got your back</i>

56:19.366 --> 56:22.336
<i>All for one and that's a fact
Knights fall pitch black</i>

56:23.970 --> 56:25.028
No!

56:25.772 --> 56:27.536
Yeah!

56:28.108 --> 56:30.475
- Come on.
- Yeah!

56:30.810 --> 56:33.643
We did that.
That's what I'm talk...

56:34.314 --> 56:36.476
Hey, good job.

56:38.485 --> 56:39.975
- No.
- We're...

56:48.495 --> 56:52.193
Guys, come on.
This was so great.

56:53.199 --> 56:57.397
We were a team.
We worked together. Come on.

56:59.372 --> 57:00.737
Come on.

57:00.907 --> 57:01.897
Mm-mm.

57:06.479 --> 57:07.708
You know what we should try?

57:08.882 --> 57:10.043
An icebreaker.

57:12.686 --> 57:14.211
You say something
you really like about

57:14.354 --> 57:17.119
the other person, okay?
I'll start.

57:21.895 --> 57:22.794
Harry.

57:24.497 --> 57:25.521
Great accent.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.867
- Now, you go.
- Is she always this perky?

57:30.570 --> 57:32.095
Oh, it wasn't really your turn,
but thank you.

57:32.238 --> 57:33.967
- Okay. Evie, come here.
- Yeah.

57:34.507 --> 57:36.168
- I love you.
- I love you.

57:36.342 --> 57:39.107
I love this energy,
but we are very short on time.

57:39.379 --> 57:41.507
Audrey clearly knows that we're here
and we need to get out of here,

57:41.681 --> 57:42.842
- ASAP.
- All right, where does

57:42.916 --> 57:44.008
this cheerleader bunk down?

57:44.084 --> 57:46.246
Even if she's not there,
we might find some sort of clue.

57:46.753 --> 57:48.118
Actually, she's still
in the dorms.

57:48.488 --> 57:50.047
You're right.
Because of summer school.

57:50.190 --> 57:52.557
What? Summer school?

57:53.126 --> 57:56.687
Summer school!
No wonder she wants revenge.

57:56.930 --> 57:59.456
Okay. I need you guys
to go find Ben.

57:59.966 --> 58:02.697
We will meet back
at Evie's in two hours, okay?

58:02.903 --> 58:04.997
Sounds like we're going
with my plan. I'm just saying.

58:05.138 --> 58:06.503
It was kind of the obvious plan.

58:06.573 --> 58:08.132
- Uma said it first.
- Right. So my plan.

58:08.275 --> 58:09.572
- Right?
- Whatever.

58:23.490 --> 58:24.719
She's nowhere on campus.

58:25.492 --> 58:28.553
Found her diary. And dang,
did you ruin Audrey's life.

58:28.862 --> 58:30.159
Okay. So did you find anything
in there

58:30.296 --> 58:32.094
that we don't already know or...

58:32.799 --> 58:35.393
She hangs out at Fairy Cottage.
You know, where Flora, Fauna

58:35.569 --> 58:37.560
and Merryweather hid her mom
from your mom.

58:37.804 --> 58:39.966
Yes. The irony
is not lost on me.

58:40.674 --> 58:43.302
How could anyone with this bed
ever be unhappy?

58:44.144 --> 58:46.135
Okay. How do I look?

58:49.849 --> 58:51.112
Okay. The bling stays here.

58:51.451 --> 58:53.783
- But she's bad.
- And we're not.

58:58.225 --> 58:59.556
Ben!

59:00.460 --> 59:01.450
Ben!

59:03.630 --> 59:04.791
Dude.

59:05.565 --> 59:06.896
Come on. Nothing?

59:07.801 --> 59:09.701
These things
just grow everywhere.

59:15.742 --> 59:18.939
Hey, we should play
that icebreaker. Um,

59:19.379 --> 59:21.746
Jay, I like the way that you can

59:22.315 --> 59:24.579
bounce around
and jump off things.

59:25.151 --> 59:26.380
These are free, right?

59:28.421 --> 59:29.855
Yeah. Um...

59:33.860 --> 59:35.851
I like how you get
a kick out of a berry bush.

59:38.631 --> 59:41.362
I guess you've probably seen
everything by now, huh?

59:41.835 --> 59:44.031
Furry rocks. Giant fish.

59:44.471 --> 59:47.031
You're probably used to grabbing
lunch off of a bush.

59:47.440 --> 59:49.101
No. I mean, no, not really.

59:49.442 --> 59:50.773
I mainly just use
the vending machines

59:50.877 --> 59:52.504
at practice. You know, tourney,

59:52.612 --> 59:53.909
kind of eats up
most of my time. So...

59:54.214 --> 59:58.617
Tourney,
that's a wee boy's game.

59:59.385 --> 01:00:02.912
Hey, you know what would be fun?
To go rafting on a jungle river.

01:00:03.790 --> 01:00:06.259
- Find a lost civilization.
- Oh, or maybe a penguin.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.050
Oh, well, you'd find those more
in like icebergs,

01:00:08.194 --> 01:00:10.128
but I'd love to see
one of those.

01:00:10.563 --> 01:00:12.827
You guys are killing me.

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:21.069
Hmm.

01:00:22.075 --> 01:00:24.544
- P.S., your mutt went that way.
- Carlos!

01:00:24.978 --> 01:00:27.276
- Dude, what do you see?
- This way!

01:00:36.356 --> 01:00:37.881
I really hope they found Ben.

01:00:39.426 --> 01:00:40.825
Nice digs.

01:00:42.128 --> 01:00:43.653
I got a really good deal.

01:00:56.476 --> 01:00:57.773
It's okay.

01:00:58.378 --> 01:01:00.176
Shh! It's okay.

01:01:18.198 --> 01:01:19.666
Don't worry, Dizzy.

01:01:21.134 --> 01:01:22.624
We can fix this.

01:01:23.736 --> 01:01:25.033
And once we do,

01:01:25.438 --> 01:01:27.532
they're gonna let
all the kids come from the Isle.

01:01:28.541 --> 01:01:30.703
So, happy dreams.

01:01:40.787 --> 01:01:42.516
- Uh, who's the dude?
- Doug.

01:01:45.492 --> 01:01:46.482
Doug.

01:01:47.427 --> 01:01:48.519
Wake up.

01:01:49.863 --> 01:01:51.888
- Wake up.
- He's spelled.

01:01:53.033 --> 01:01:54.296
Is she not a fast learner?

01:01:54.434 --> 01:01:55.868
She's emotionally involved,
okay?

01:01:58.538 --> 01:01:59.903
Well, in that case,
she should be able

01:02:00.006 --> 01:02:00.871
to wake him up.

01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:06.175
True love's kiss.
Works every time.

01:02:08.214 --> 01:02:09.875
Well, we haven't used
the "L" word yet.

01:02:16.122 --> 01:02:17.385
Can we be alone?

01:02:31.137 --> 01:02:34.300
<i>Don't freak out it's okay
'Cause true love can save the day</i>

01:02:34.541 --> 01:02:37.408
<i>And I think we feel the same
But I don't know</i>

01:02:37.911 --> 01:02:41.176
<i>When we met it was sweet
He was oh so into me</i>

01:02:41.414 --> 01:02:44.440
<i>Seems like things are meant
To be but I don't know</i>

01:02:44.784 --> 01:02:47.913
<i>Does he love me?
Or does he love me not?</i>

01:02:48.288 --> 01:02:51.952
<i>Do I love him?
And is it strong enough?</i>

01:02:52.125 --> 01:02:53.923
- <i>One kiss</i>
- <i>One kiss</i>

01:02:54.127 --> 01:02:56.095
<i>It all comes down to this
One kiss</i>

01:02:56.329 --> 01:02:57.387
<i>One kiss</i>

01:02:58.998 --> 01:03:02.229
<i>One kiss, one kiss
This moment could be it</i>

01:03:02.569 --> 01:03:06.369
<i>And I wanna know so here I go</i>

01:03:08.875 --> 01:03:11.970
<i>Keep it cool keep it calm
Think he's loved me all along</i>

01:03:12.245 --> 01:03:14.771
<i>But maybe I got it wrong
So I don't know</i>

01:03:15.382 --> 01:03:18.943
<i>He's so good got my back
But maybe I'm just too bad</i>

01:03:19.085 --> 01:03:22.055
<i>Could we be a perfect match?
No I don't know</i>

01:03:22.655 --> 01:03:25.625
<i>Does he love me?
Or does he love me not?</i>

01:03:25.859 --> 01:03:30.160
<i>Do I love him?
And is it strong enough?</i>

01:03:31.798 --> 01:03:33.232
- <i>One kiss</i>
- <i>One kiss</i>

01:03:33.433 --> 01:03:36.733
<i>It all comes down to this
One kiss, one kiss</i>

01:03:38.538 --> 01:03:40.006
- <i>One kiss</i>
- <i>One kiss</i>

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:41.699
<i>This moment could be it</i>

01:03:41.941 --> 01:03:46.208
<i>And I wanna know so here I go</i>

01:03:47.747 --> 01:03:49.909
<i>Yeah here I go</i>

01:03:51.418 --> 01:03:54.945
<i>I feel my heartbeat beating
Saying it's gonna work</i>

01:03:55.021 --> 01:03:58.719
<i>But if I'm dream, dream
Dreaming this is gonna hurt</i>

01:03:59.426 --> 01:04:02.487
<i>Either I will or I won't
What if I do and you don't?</i>

01:04:02.796 --> 01:04:04.423
<i>Is he my Romeo?</i>

01:04:04.564 --> 01:04:09.502
<i>Oh, there's only one, one way
To really know</i>

01:04:10.770 --> 01:04:12.238
<i>Hey</i>

01:04:17.944 --> 01:04:19.275
<i>Hey</i>

01:04:22.749 --> 01:04:23.910
<i>Hey</i>

01:04:24.617 --> 01:04:26.142
<i>One kiss, one kiss</i>

01:04:26.453 --> 01:04:29.753
<i>It all comes down to this
One kiss, one kiss</i>

01:04:31.591 --> 01:04:34.686
<i>One kiss, one kiss
This moment could be it</i>

01:04:35.061 --> 01:04:38.895
<i>I, I, I wanna know
So here I go</i>

01:04:40.867 --> 01:04:43.564
<i>Here I go</i>

01:04:44.237 --> 01:04:47.434
<i>Here I go</i>

01:04:47.707 --> 01:04:50.506
<i>Here I go</i>

01:05:26.446 --> 01:05:27.504
Ben!

01:05:31.818 --> 01:05:34.651
Boy, something stinks.
And it wasn't me this time.

01:05:41.328 --> 01:05:42.318
Gil.

01:05:49.903 --> 01:05:51.234
- Gil.
- Watch out!

01:05:57.744 --> 01:05:59.371
You need some serious
nose adjustments.

01:05:59.546 --> 01:06:00.638
I'm not so sure.

01:06:03.883 --> 01:06:05.851
Ben? Did Audrey do that?

01:06:05.986 --> 01:06:07.977
Huh! I thought I recognized
those pants.

01:06:09.723 --> 01:06:12.715
Oh, he's got a boo-boo.
That's why he's so cranky.

01:06:13.226 --> 01:06:14.990
You know, my dad said
that his dad

01:06:15.128 --> 01:06:17.358
did not handle pain well at all.

01:06:19.866 --> 01:06:21.595
You're good with animals.
Do something.

01:06:21.768 --> 01:06:23.793
But... Okay. All right.

01:06:26.973 --> 01:06:28.702
Hey, Ben.

01:06:29.409 --> 01:06:31.707
It's me, Carlos, all right?

01:06:32.278 --> 01:06:33.677
Ben! Ben!

01:06:33.847 --> 01:06:35.178
It's Carlos, all right?

01:06:35.749 --> 01:06:36.944
You know me.

01:06:37.818 --> 01:06:40.515
You helped me once.
Remember, with Dude?

01:06:41.054 --> 01:06:42.852
Right? Let me help you.

01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:45.415
Come on. Let me see your hand.

01:06:46.526 --> 01:06:48.119
All right. Attaboy.

01:06:48.929 --> 01:06:50.124
Beast... King...

01:06:50.964 --> 01:06:52.159
So... Whatever.

01:06:52.999 --> 01:06:54.330
Oh, yeah.
That's a big one. Uh...

01:06:56.269 --> 01:06:58.363
I'm gonna count,
all right? One...

01:06:59.272 --> 01:07:00.535
- Two.
- Two...

01:07:04.511 --> 01:07:07.344
There it is. You did it.

01:07:15.956 --> 01:07:17.185
Hey.

01:07:18.725 --> 01:07:20.489
- Oh, my gosh, I was so worried.
- You didn't show up.

01:07:20.627 --> 01:07:22.391
- I didn't forget your party.
- I got scared she got you too.

01:07:22.495 --> 01:07:23.985
I'm so glad you're all right.

01:07:28.001 --> 01:07:28.991
All right.

01:07:29.636 --> 01:07:30.728
- You good?
- Yeah.

01:07:30.971 --> 01:07:32.268
Take a seat right there, okay?

01:07:32.572 --> 01:07:33.562
There you go.

01:07:37.978 --> 01:07:41.846
- Oh, that was funky.
- It was. There's...

01:07:42.615 --> 01:07:44.606
- Huh? Oh, wow.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:47.554 --> 01:07:48.851
You need another blast.

01:07:50.023 --> 01:07:51.081
Please...

01:07:52.692 --> 01:07:54.683
- Please stop.
- Huh.

01:07:55.361 --> 01:07:57.762
It's Enchanted Lake water.
I guess it can only do so much.

01:07:59.666 --> 01:08:02.431
Well, well, well.

01:08:03.603 --> 01:08:05.002
Harry Hook.

01:08:05.505 --> 01:08:08.236
And you,
my little duckling are...

01:08:09.509 --> 01:08:10.533
ravishing.

01:08:13.146 --> 01:08:15.444
Okay. Ravishing and taken...

01:08:15.882 --> 01:08:17.577
just in case
anyone was confused.

01:08:17.716 --> 01:08:18.843
Hold on.

01:08:20.153 --> 01:08:21.587
Who's side are they on?

01:08:23.256 --> 01:08:24.621
They escaped and joined us.

01:08:24.991 --> 01:08:26.720
And Mal has the ember,
which is our only hope

01:08:26.826 --> 01:08:28.520
to stop Audrey.
Details to follow.

01:08:28.595 --> 01:08:30.723
Hades' ember?
Has Mal gone back to the Isle?

01:08:30.964 --> 01:08:32.227
I said details to follow.
We're meeting up

01:08:32.365 --> 01:08:33.957
- with Mal, Evie and Uma. Let's go.
- Uma?

01:08:34.167 --> 01:08:36.033
- Details to follow.
- All right.

01:08:42.742 --> 01:08:44.368
Hey, Jay...

01:08:44.911 --> 01:08:47.642
...yeah, thanks for saving me,
gorgeous face.

01:08:54.953 --> 01:08:58.390
That was a really good idea,
to check Audrey's room.

01:08:59.559 --> 01:09:01.287
Now, we know
that we're on the right track.

01:09:01.428 --> 01:09:03.089
Is there an insult in there
that I missed?

01:09:05.465 --> 01:09:06.694
Just...

01:09:07.767 --> 01:09:08.962
I wanted to thank you.

01:09:12.706 --> 01:09:15.175
No! You think
you're on the right track?

01:09:15.742 --> 01:09:17.038
We're not going anywhere!

01:09:19.112 --> 01:09:20.341
Let's mess them up a little.

01:09:20.647 --> 01:09:23.241
I say we go back to my place
and maybe binge-watch some TV?

01:09:23.383 --> 01:09:25.249
Huh? Or maybe
order some stuff online?

01:09:25.685 --> 01:09:27.210
Yeah? Yeah.

01:09:27.886 --> 01:09:29.252
What about pizza, huh?

01:09:30.055 --> 01:09:32.684
Yeah, you don't like pizza.
Salad? Sa...!

01:09:34.594 --> 01:09:37.564
No, no, no, no, no,
Audrey. Audrey.

01:09:38.899 --> 01:09:40.162
Audrey!

01:09:44.537 --> 01:09:46.938
Audrey!

01:09:47.674 --> 01:09:48.970
<i>I don't know
whose birthday it is,</i>

01:09:49.042 --> 01:09:50.532
<i>but I want this cake.</i>

01:09:53.712 --> 01:09:57.172
So, I maybe kind of missed
the boat a little bit on

01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:58.818
calling you Shrimpy
and not letting you

01:09:58.885 --> 01:09:59.784
join the gang.

01:10:01.722 --> 01:10:02.712
Yeah.

01:10:03.256 --> 01:10:05.122
We really could've torn up
the Isle together.

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.732
Oh!

01:10:23.710 --> 01:10:25.804
- Celia!
- We're trapped!

01:10:26.747 --> 01:10:28.875
Are you guys okay?
What's going on?

01:10:29.916 --> 01:10:31.782
You've caused my friends pain
and fear.

01:10:31.918 --> 01:10:34.012
We've had enough, now disappear!

01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:38.824
You guys, I'm sorry.
My spells aren't working.

01:10:38.992 --> 01:10:40.926
Audrey's magic
is getting stronger.

01:10:43.897 --> 01:10:45.831
You've caused our friends
pain and fear

01:10:45.966 --> 01:10:48.162
we've had enough, now disappear.

01:10:54.007 --> 01:10:55.133
No!

01:10:56.410 --> 01:10:57.536
You did it!

01:10:58.678 --> 01:10:59.873
Together!

01:11:01.081 --> 01:11:02.981
This is what I've been
talking about.

01:11:04.351 --> 01:11:07.446
I guess my shell likes you.

01:11:12.726 --> 01:11:14.216
Why don't you hold on to that?

01:11:21.802 --> 01:11:23.930
Hey, it's your bae.

01:11:30.277 --> 01:11:31.642
Ben!

01:11:33.813 --> 01:11:35.372
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm so much

01:11:35.515 --> 01:11:37.882
- better right now. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:11:40.287 --> 01:11:41.618
Are you okay?

01:11:42.722 --> 01:11:44.747
I always knew you'd be part
of the solution.

01:11:47.927 --> 01:11:49.918
- What is this?
- Oh, yeah.

01:11:50.063 --> 01:11:51.792
- I could get used to this.
- You like it?

01:11:51.898 --> 01:11:53.059
I love this.

01:11:53.567 --> 01:11:55.160
- What about those?
- Oh.

01:11:56.403 --> 01:11:57.962
- No.
- I like them.

01:11:59.472 --> 01:12:01.702
Okay, so, we all think
that Audrey could be

01:12:01.841 --> 01:12:03.468
at Fairy Cottage.
We have no idea where it is.

01:12:03.610 --> 01:12:06.204
- Did she ever take you there?
- Every Fairy Godmother's Day.

01:12:07.013 --> 01:12:08.845
Where is Fairy Godmother
when you need her?

01:12:09.516 --> 01:12:10.608
I wish I knew.

01:12:12.686 --> 01:12:16.316
Hey, this might be a bad time.
But...

01:12:17.691 --> 01:12:20.456
Happy birthday.
I made it with my 3D printer.

01:12:23.029 --> 01:12:24.758
That's our names put together.

01:12:25.599 --> 01:12:27.499
- No. I get it, yeah.
- Yeah, because,

01:12:27.734 --> 01:12:30.203
you know, we're together.
You and me were like a couple.

01:12:30.570 --> 01:12:32.436
Right. 'Cause Jane and Carlos
make Jarlos.

01:12:32.572 --> 01:12:34.734
Yes. Yeah.
I could've gone with Cane, um,

01:12:35.075 --> 01:12:37.476
but I went with Jarlos.
Unless you prefer Cane.

01:12:37.711 --> 01:12:39.702
- Oh, no. No, I love it.
- You prefer Cane? Yes, you do.

01:12:39.813 --> 01:12:41.645
It's fine. You know what?
I can remake it. It's cool.

01:12:41.781 --> 01:12:43.271
- It's fine.
- No, Carlos.

01:12:43.917 --> 01:12:44.975
It's perfect.

01:12:50.724 --> 01:12:52.954
Doug! Go with Jane.

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:54.691
We need to find
Fairy Godmother.

01:12:54.794 --> 01:12:56.421
- They might need some muscle.
- Hey.

01:12:56.997 --> 01:12:57.987
Well, I'll go.

01:12:58.532 --> 01:13:00.330
Yeah, actually,
I would feel better.

01:13:00.467 --> 01:13:02.026
Yeah, actually,
I'd feel better, too.

01:13:02.169 --> 01:13:03.068
Same.

01:13:04.170 --> 01:13:05.467
Actually, I would, too.

01:13:06.206 --> 01:13:07.731
All right, man. Let's do it.

01:13:08.074 --> 01:13:09.337
- Let's go, Jane.
- Okay.

01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:11.335
- Be careful, okay?
- I will.

01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:24.551
Come on, Dude.

01:14:09.603 --> 01:14:10.695
She's not upstairs.

01:14:24.684 --> 01:14:25.674
Chad?

01:14:26.887 --> 01:14:27.979
I want my mommy.

01:14:29.089 --> 01:14:30.181
No.

01:14:30.890 --> 01:14:32.085
It's okay.

01:14:33.827 --> 01:14:34.988
What happened, buddy?

01:14:40.033 --> 01:14:41.125
Hmm.

01:14:43.069 --> 01:14:45.333
Ben. Ben!

01:14:46.406 --> 01:14:47.635
Your face.

01:14:49.876 --> 01:14:51.037
She's gone? Huh?

01:14:52.546 --> 01:14:56.608
The door is open. I'm free.
Freedom! Oh!

01:14:57.951 --> 01:14:59.112
Freedom!

01:15:09.763 --> 01:15:11.197
Oh, my gosh.

01:15:16.169 --> 01:15:17.193
Hi, Mom.

01:15:18.171 --> 01:15:19.161
Um,

01:15:19.439 --> 01:15:20.998
I don't know if you can hear me.

01:15:21.241 --> 01:15:22.936
But it's been
a really crazy day.

01:15:24.678 --> 01:15:26.646
On the plus side,
it's been the longest birthday

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:27.938
I've ever had.

01:15:28.515 --> 01:15:31.109
On the minus side,
everybody's under an evil spell.

01:15:32.319 --> 01:15:34.310
But on the plus side,
Carlos remembered my birthday.

01:15:34.521 --> 01:15:35.682
See?

01:15:36.356 --> 01:15:38.051
We're going to figure out
how to undo this.

01:15:38.158 --> 01:15:39.819
We'll find a way
to make this right, Mom.

01:15:42.763 --> 01:15:44.595
Ooh. All right.
Let's get this Audrey chick

01:15:44.731 --> 01:15:45.823
taken care of already.

01:15:46.099 --> 01:15:47.863
What do you say, girls?

01:15:47.934 --> 01:15:49.333
Time to wrap things up?

01:15:50.804 --> 01:15:51.999
You know, someday,

01:15:52.139 --> 01:15:54.540
you're gonna have to tell me
how you guys all got teamed up.

01:15:54.808 --> 01:15:58.438
Actually, Mal promised to let
all the kids off the Isle

01:15:58.611 --> 01:16:00.238
- once this is over.
- Mal?

01:16:00.981 --> 01:16:02.642
I have
to tell you guys something.

01:16:07.721 --> 01:16:09.086
Um...

01:16:12.159 --> 01:16:13.422
I lied to you.

01:16:18.098 --> 01:16:20.465
The kids won't be coming off
the Isle.

01:16:21.034 --> 01:16:24.004
- What do you mean?
- The program is shut down.

01:16:25.639 --> 01:16:26.902
And the barrier...

01:16:27.574 --> 01:16:29.099
will be closed for good.

01:16:29.409 --> 01:16:31.935
For Auradon's safety.

01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:34.370
Hold up.

01:16:36.316 --> 01:16:38.148
So we're saving
your precious people

01:16:38.652 --> 01:16:40.677
and your behinds for a lie.

01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:45.588
I knew it was a mistake
to trust you.

01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:48.619
You're always out for yourself.

01:16:50.130 --> 01:16:52.861
And you, King Benny...

01:16:57.971 --> 01:17:00.133
you're probably just gonna throw
us all back inside.

01:17:04.878 --> 01:17:06.243
You know what?

01:17:07.047 --> 01:17:08.537
I actually thought
you were brave.

01:17:09.316 --> 01:17:10.613
You're nothing but a chicken.

01:17:11.084 --> 01:17:12.609
Too scared to tell me
I was never gonna see

01:17:12.686 --> 01:17:14.415
- my dad again.
- Celia.

01:17:14.988 --> 01:17:16.820
Celia. Celia, no!

01:17:17.057 --> 01:17:18.650
- Celia!
- No! No.

01:17:21.361 --> 01:17:23.090
Regain your might and ignite!

01:17:24.064 --> 01:17:24.997
No...

01:17:25.999 --> 01:17:28.400
Regain your might and ignite!

01:17:32.839 --> 01:17:34.000
Bummer.

01:17:36.376 --> 01:17:38.276
Let's go find Gil
and leave them all to rot.

01:17:38.845 --> 01:17:39.835
No.

01:17:41.448 --> 01:17:42.438
Uh...

01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:44.545
Uma!

01:17:51.558 --> 01:17:52.548
Evie...

01:17:53.493 --> 01:17:55.052
I'm so sorry.

01:17:55.662 --> 01:17:58.154
I'm sorry, I just...
I thought that...

01:17:58.832 --> 01:18:00.857
I was afraid to tell you.
I thought I was gonna

01:18:01.001 --> 01:18:02.332
lose my best friend.

01:18:02.636 --> 01:18:06.869
But I had to do something.
I had to protect Auradon.

01:18:07.374 --> 01:18:09.399
Closing the barrier
was your idea?

01:18:09.609 --> 01:18:11.077
I did it for us.

01:18:12.679 --> 01:18:16.877
I did it for our life
that we have here now.

01:18:17.017 --> 01:18:18.109
For our life?

01:18:19.653 --> 01:18:22.554
What about the kids that
we left behind on that island?

01:18:23.490 --> 01:18:25.185
The kids that we promised?

01:18:26.126 --> 01:18:27.753
We were their only hope.

01:18:30.330 --> 01:18:32.765
I thought you were gonna
stand up for the V.K.'s.

01:18:35.869 --> 01:18:37.598
But instead, you lied to them.

01:18:40.807 --> 01:18:42.206
And you lied to Jay.

01:18:43.543 --> 01:18:45.204
And you lied to Carlos.

01:18:46.713 --> 01:18:48.147
And you lied to me.

01:18:50.984 --> 01:18:52.452
We're your family.

01:18:54.688 --> 01:18:55.678
Evie.

01:18:58.692 --> 01:19:01.525
Evie, come on. I had no choice!

01:19:05.999 --> 01:19:07.023
No.

01:19:15.108 --> 01:19:18.908
<i>Here you are alone
And you deserve it</i>

01:19:19.913 --> 01:19:24.851
<i>Your friends have turned
To stone and that's on you</i>

01:19:25.018 --> 01:19:29.353
<i>You had a cause to serve
But did you serve it?</i>

01:19:29.923 --> 01:19:34.918
<i>Did you see yourself in a way
That wasn't true?</i>

01:19:38.131 --> 01:19:42.568
<i>Why tell all those lies?
You feel unworthy</i>

01:19:42.836 --> 01:19:48.138
<i>Like there isn't solid ground
For you to stand</i>

01:19:48.408 --> 01:19:52.470
<i>But a sacrifice is not
A firm foundation</i>

01:19:52.879 --> 01:19:58.113
<i>You cannot build a castle
On a mountain made of sand</i>

01:19:58.318 --> 01:20:02.880
<i>This is not your father's
Fairy tale</i>

01:20:03.256 --> 01:20:09.161
<i>And no it's not
Your mother's fault you fail</i>

01:20:09.429 --> 01:20:14.629
<i>So when your story comes
To light</i>

01:20:14.801 --> 01:20:18.260
<i>Make sure the story
That they write</i>

01:20:18.505 --> 01:20:24.535
<i>Goes once upon a time
She fought the dragon</i>

01:20:24.778 --> 01:20:29.511
<i>Once upon a time
That beast was me</i>

01:20:29.716 --> 01:20:32.208
<i>Once upon a misspent youth</i>

01:20:32.352 --> 01:20:36.516
<i>She faced herself
She spoke the truth</i>

01:20:36.723 --> 01:20:42.355
<i>That's how I see
My once upon a time</i>

01:20:42.529 --> 01:20:46.466
<i>This time</i>

01:20:49.536 --> 01:20:50.731
Uma!

01:20:51.805 --> 01:20:55.207
Uma, stop! Please, stop!
I need your help.

01:20:55.409 --> 01:20:57.309
We have a chance
if we do this together.

01:20:57.644 --> 01:20:59.476
Your friends kick you
to the curb?

01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:01.604
Good.

01:21:02.015 --> 01:21:05.144
Ben saw something in you.
And today, Uma, I saw it, too.

01:21:05.385 --> 01:21:08.047
You care. Uma,
you care about everybody.

01:21:08.221 --> 01:21:10.747
And Auradon is worth saving.

01:21:11.391 --> 01:21:13.621
Help us, please.

01:21:16.763 --> 01:21:18.162
You talk pretty, but...

01:21:19.165 --> 01:21:20.792
she's already made up her mind.

01:21:22.769 --> 01:21:24.259
You brought this
on yourself, Mal.

01:21:24.805 --> 01:21:26.204
You figure out how to fix it.

01:21:27.107 --> 01:21:28.131
Let's go.

01:21:34.147 --> 01:21:38.948
<i>Life is not a storybook
But life unfolds in chapters</i>

01:21:39.352 --> 01:21:43.949
<i>Turn the page
And start to make amends</i>

01:21:44.224 --> 01:21:46.625
<i>There's no pre-written
Guarantee</i>

01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:51.627
<i>Of happily ever after
Step into your greatness</i>

01:21:51.831 --> 01:21:56.792
<i>Before your story ends</i>

01:21:57.037 --> 01:22:02.305
<i>So when your story ends
They'll say</i>

01:22:02.642 --> 01:22:07.512
<i>Once upon a time
A girl flew higher</i>

01:22:07.647 --> 01:22:12.551
<i>Once upon a time
She made things right</i>

01:22:12.819 --> 01:22:16.278
<i>Once upon a tie that binds
She changed her heart</i>

01:22:16.523 --> 01:22:20.983
<i>To change their minds
That's got to be</i>

01:22:21.228 --> 01:22:26.098
<i>My once upon a time</i>

01:22:26.366 --> 01:22:29.825
<i>This once upon a time</i>

01:22:30.103 --> 01:22:36.736
<i>Will finally see
My once upon a time</i>

01:22:38.011 --> 01:22:44.610
<i>This time</i>

01:22:49.856 --> 01:22:51.153
Help me, Mal!

01:22:51.391 --> 01:22:53.291
Yeah,
save your little friend, Mal!

01:23:17.184 --> 01:23:18.777
Help me, Mal!

01:23:21.688 --> 01:23:23.554
Careful not to fry
your little V.K. buddy.

01:23:25.859 --> 01:23:27.122
Whoa!

01:23:35.201 --> 01:23:37.431
She doesn't stand a chance
without the ember.

01:23:37.838 --> 01:23:39.272
Help me, Mal!

01:23:42.075 --> 01:23:43.133
Come on.

01:23:44.745 --> 01:23:47.578
Hold still,
you little brat!

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:01.755
We're stronger together.

01:24:02.128 --> 01:24:04.119
We're stronger together!
I'm right here, Mal!

01:24:05.098 --> 01:24:07.465
Regain your might and ignite.
I'm right here, girl.

01:24:07.601 --> 01:24:10.866
I'm right here.
Regain your might and ignite!

01:24:18.712 --> 01:24:19.907
Yes!

01:24:23.650 --> 01:24:26.779
- You want a piece of this, huh?
- No, no!

01:24:44.704 --> 01:24:45.694
Go, Mal!

01:24:45.872 --> 01:24:48.136
- Go, Mal!
- You got this! You got this, girl!

01:24:58.084 --> 01:25:01.349
- Yeah! Come on!
- Yes!

01:25:11.731 --> 01:25:12.721
Mal!

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:14.824
Celia.

01:25:15.702 --> 01:25:17.602
It's okay. I've got you.

01:25:30.217 --> 01:25:31.309
Audrey?

01:25:32.686 --> 01:25:33.847
Oh, no.

01:25:38.592 --> 01:25:40.390
<i>You're only half Hades.</i>

01:25:40.994 --> 01:25:43.656
<i>The ember won't do everything
for you that it does for me.</i>

01:26:02.115 --> 01:26:03.276
I'm hungry.

01:26:04.050 --> 01:26:05.040
Same.

01:26:15.762 --> 01:26:16.820
Oh!

01:26:17.364 --> 01:26:20.732
- Mom. Mom!
- Bibbidi-bobbidi, what happened?

01:26:21.268 --> 01:26:23.703
The spell has been broken.
It's okay.

01:26:31.378 --> 01:26:33.346
Come on. Let's go.

01:26:34.114 --> 01:26:35.548
- You good?
- Yeah.

01:26:40.687 --> 01:26:41.813
She's slipping away.

01:26:48.795 --> 01:26:51.730
There's only one person
in the world who might be able

01:26:51.865 --> 01:26:53.765
to do something about this,
and that's Hades.

01:26:54.167 --> 01:26:56.067
Hades? He wouldn't do it.

01:26:56.703 --> 01:26:57.898
I wouldn't risk it.

01:26:58.238 --> 01:26:59.672
Actually, he might do it for me.

01:27:01.608 --> 01:27:02.734
He's my father.

01:27:07.213 --> 01:27:08.271
Okay.

01:27:10.517 --> 01:27:12.576
Well, I'll have to send guards
to get him.

01:27:13.587 --> 01:27:15.055
Maybe I can hitch a ride.

01:27:17.958 --> 01:27:19.153
The Isle is my home.

01:27:20.861 --> 01:27:22.386
Someone needs to be there
to protect it.

01:27:23.597 --> 01:27:25.861
Well, then,
you will need your first mate.

01:27:28.301 --> 01:27:30.065
The Isle will be
in very good hands.

01:27:33.573 --> 01:27:34.734
Can I go, too?

01:27:37.611 --> 01:27:39.545
I wish I could be
in both places.

01:27:51.391 --> 01:27:53.052
I really think that Evie
was right.

01:27:54.161 --> 01:27:55.185
And...

01:27:55.929 --> 01:27:57.829
I do think
that we could've been friends.

01:28:01.868 --> 01:28:04.200
And I'm really sorry
that I lied to all of you guys.

01:28:05.072 --> 01:28:06.506
You deserved so much better
than that.

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:08.538
You were just trying to do
the right thing.

01:28:09.075 --> 01:28:10.099
Yeah.

01:28:18.919 --> 01:28:19.909
I get it.

01:28:50.016 --> 01:28:51.177
Thank you for coming.

01:28:51.918 --> 01:28:53.909
Didn't have much choice.

01:28:55.689 --> 01:28:56.884
Can you wake her?

01:28:57.758 --> 01:29:00.159
Since when do heroes
care about villains?

01:29:00.894 --> 01:29:02.589
- She's...
- One of your own.

01:29:04.598 --> 01:29:05.690
Right.

01:29:08.502 --> 01:29:11.199
When you guys
try to destroy the world...

01:29:13.006 --> 01:29:14.371
it's an error in judgment.

01:29:16.143 --> 01:29:17.702
But when it's one of us...

01:29:18.612 --> 01:29:20.307
lock them up
and throw away the key.

01:29:22.783 --> 01:29:23.807
Right, Beast?

01:29:30.423 --> 01:29:31.913
Yeah. I'm gonna need
to use my hands.

01:29:56.650 --> 01:29:57.913
Haven't lost my touch.

01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:07.855
Dad!

01:30:34.254 --> 01:30:36.279
Audrey.

01:30:37.023 --> 01:30:38.354
You're okay.

01:30:41.962 --> 01:30:43.452
Tell me it was all a bad dream.

01:30:43.797 --> 01:30:45.094
I wish I could.

01:30:45.966 --> 01:30:48.128
But, it's over now.

01:30:54.141 --> 01:30:55.233
I'm sorry.

01:30:57.511 --> 01:30:59.070
I wanted to hurt you both.

01:31:01.181 --> 01:31:02.910
I wanted to hurt all of you.

01:31:10.724 --> 01:31:13.523
I have owed you
an apology for...

01:31:14.527 --> 01:31:16.154
a very long time now.

01:31:19.399 --> 01:31:20.560
And so have I.

01:31:23.837 --> 01:31:25.100
And perhaps,

01:31:25.672 --> 01:31:29.609
I have owed you one, too.

01:31:39.186 --> 01:31:40.984
Oh, yeah.

01:32:01.241 --> 01:32:02.265
Dad!

01:32:08.882 --> 01:32:11.579
I'm gonna have to miss you
all over again.

01:32:13.887 --> 01:32:15.821
Thanks for a glimpse of the sun.

01:33:00.567 --> 01:33:02.194
Look at you!
That color!

01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:07.766
There they are.

01:33:14.748 --> 01:33:15.715
Hi.

01:33:31.698 --> 01:33:33.097
Lady Mal and I wanna thank you

01:33:33.233 --> 01:33:35.224
for celebrating our engagement
with us today.

01:33:35.702 --> 01:33:39.138
I couldn't be prouder or happier
to call you my Queen.

01:33:41.141 --> 01:33:42.131
So...

01:33:42.809 --> 01:33:44.072
raise your glasses.

01:33:44.978 --> 01:33:46.446
To our future Queen of Auradon.

01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:49.240
- To our Queen of Auradon!
- To our Queen of Auradon!

01:33:50.384 --> 01:33:53.410
- Speech, Your Special-ness.
- Speech, Your Fancy One.

01:34:08.635 --> 01:34:09.727
I can't.

01:34:13.006 --> 01:34:15.839
- I can't be Queen of Auradon.
- Mal.

01:34:16.576 --> 01:34:18.601
I can't turn my back
on the Isle.

01:34:25.318 --> 01:34:26.843
We made a decision...

01:34:28.255 --> 01:34:30.087
to close the barrier forever.

01:34:34.027 --> 01:34:35.552
And it was my idea.

01:34:38.832 --> 01:34:40.300
But it's wrong.

01:34:43.670 --> 01:34:44.831
I've learned...

01:34:45.906 --> 01:34:48.603
that you can't live in fear...

01:34:50.577 --> 01:34:52.978
because it doesn't actually
protect you from anything.

01:34:55.949 --> 01:34:59.010
You never know where the bad
is gonna come from.

01:35:00.287 --> 01:35:01.686
And you never know
where the heroes

01:35:01.822 --> 01:35:03.347
are gonna come from either.

01:35:03.757 --> 01:35:07.216
Without Uma and her pirates,
Auradon would be gone.

01:35:09.596 --> 01:35:10.927
And without Hades...

01:35:11.898 --> 01:35:13.161
my father...

01:35:21.708 --> 01:35:22.869
...Audrey would be gone.

01:35:28.348 --> 01:35:31.318
We are all capable of good
and bad,

01:35:31.785 --> 01:35:34.777
no matter which side
of the barrier we come from.

01:35:36.723 --> 01:35:39.920
And that's why I can't be Queen
of just Auradon.

01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:42.991
I have to be Queen
of the Isle, too.

01:35:43.263 --> 01:35:47.291
And it's time that we take
the barrier down forever.

01:35:48.635 --> 01:35:51.366
- We can't do that.
- It's up to us, Dad.

01:35:59.079 --> 01:36:00.945
I choose to be a King
who moves forward.

01:36:02.649 --> 01:36:04.310
It's time for forgiveness.

01:36:05.485 --> 01:36:06.748
It's time for new beginnings.

01:36:09.656 --> 01:36:13.718
- The barrier will come down!
- Yes!

01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:18.589
Bring it down, Mal.

01:36:53.433 --> 01:36:55.333
To make the world
a better place...

01:36:55.736 --> 01:36:58.000
We have to do it
face to face.

01:37:32.405 --> 01:37:33.395
Look!

01:37:44.918 --> 01:37:46.147
My plan.

01:37:49.422 --> 01:37:50.480
Yes!

01:38:05.238 --> 01:38:08.503
<i>It's time to bring it together</i>

01:38:09.309 --> 01:38:11.778
<i>Time for a brand new start</i>

01:38:13.079 --> 01:38:16.743
<i>We're gonna put it in motion</i>

01:38:17.084 --> 01:38:20.213
<i>Break down
What keeps us apart</i>

01:38:20.687 --> 01:38:23.816
<i>No more no division we down
New team got the vision</i>

01:38:24.057 --> 01:38:26.788
<i>Unite till we stand
Now we living marching</i>

01:38:26.993 --> 01:38:28.722
<i>In the light, one, two
One, two like</i>

01:38:28.962 --> 01:38:30.452
- <i>I see you</i>
- <i>You see me</i>

01:38:30.630 --> 01:38:32.564
- <i>Imperfect</i>
- <i>Perfectly</i>

01:38:32.699 --> 01:38:36.533
<i>Face to face we can see
Clearly our similarities like</i>

01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:40.238
- <i>Day and night</i>
- <i>Wrong or right</i>

01:38:40.774 --> 01:38:43.368
<i>We come together
For a good time</i>

01:38:43.710 --> 01:38:46.736
<i>We're gonna break this down</i>

01:38:47.614 --> 01:38:50.549
<i>We're gonna rock the town</i>

01:38:51.351 --> 01:38:54.719
<i>Everyone all around</i>

01:38:56.423 --> 01:39:00.155
<i>Let's be whoever like this
Stronger together like this</i>

01:39:00.293 --> 01:39:03.285
<i>Believing in second chances</i>

01:39:04.097 --> 01:39:06.725
<i>And we'll all starting today</i>

01:39:08.001 --> 01:39:11.904
<i>Marching on in a new land</i>

01:39:12.139 --> 01:39:15.507
<i>Our world's a better
A better place</i>

01:39:15.875 --> 01:39:17.900
<i>Welcome the additional love</i>

01:39:18.044 --> 01:39:19.773
<i>Unity new beginning for us</i>

01:39:19.946 --> 01:39:21.778
<i>Harmony that's the mission
Marching</i>

01:39:21.915 --> 01:39:23.747

Daddy!

01:42:13.486 --> 01:42:15.648
- Hey.
- Come on.

01:42:18.091 --> 01:42:19.252
- Carlos?
- Yeah?

01:42:19.392 --> 01:42:21.053
I'm actually really nervous
to meet your mom.

01:42:21.127 --> 01:42:22.094
You're nervous?

01:42:22.696 --> 01:42:25.529
His mom is Cruella De Vil!
I'm petrified.

01:42:26.633 --> 01:42:28.533
Wait 'til she hears
I want to be a vet.

01:42:28.702 --> 01:42:31.296
What do you say you and me
go exploring? I'll do a gap year.

01:42:31.771 --> 01:42:34.035
- Jungles or icebergs?
- Both?

01:42:35.175 --> 01:42:36.609
Yeah. Chest bump!

01:42:39.579 --> 01:42:42.913
Hey. Get it, girl
You know what?

01:42:43.850 --> 01:42:46.342
- Mal came through.
- She always does.

01:42:46.853 --> 01:42:49.481
- So, she's definitely taken.
- Definitely.

01:42:50.623 --> 01:42:51.749
So is Evie.

01:42:53.026 --> 01:42:54.118
What's my name?

01:42:54.761 --> 01:42:55.887
Uma.

01:42:57.897 --> 01:42:58.887
No.

01:43:00.767 --> 01:43:01.632
Oh!

01:43:02.235 --> 01:43:03.498
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:43:06.506 --> 01:43:07.371
Whoa!

01:43:09.609 --> 01:43:11.134
Am I invited to the wedding?

01:43:12.445 --> 01:43:13.606
Hi, Dad.

01:43:25.826 --> 01:43:28.454
I'm sure you two will be
very happy together.

01:43:42.476 --> 01:43:43.739
Welcome to Auradon.

01:45:13.867 --> 01:45:15.130
Do you ever miss them?

01:45:17.170 --> 01:45:18.160
Yeah.

01:45:21.107 --> 01:45:22.438
Do you think that they miss us?

01:45:24.578 --> 01:45:26.046
Yeah. Of course.

01:45:28.148 --> 01:45:29.172
'Cause we're rotten...

01:45:30.917 --> 01:45:32.078
To the core.

01:45:34.021 --> 01:45:35.511
Hey, last one over the bridge...

01:45:35.655 --> 01:45:37.020
Is a rotten apple!

01:45:49.836 --> 01:45:51.361
<i>It don't matter
What you look like</i>

01:45:51.438 --> 01:45:52.997
<i>It don't matter
What you wear</i>

01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:54.669
- <i>Hey!</i>
- <i>How many rings</i>

01:45:54.741 --> 01:45:56.766
<i>You got on your finger
We don't care!</i>

01:45:56.876 --> 01:46:00.369
- <i>No we don't care</i>
- <i>You gotta dig a little deeper</i>

01:46:00.581 --> 01:46:02.549
<i>For you it's gonna be tough</i>

01:46:02.782 --> 01:46:05.183
<i>You gotta dig a little deeper</i>

01:46:05.619 --> 01:46:07.713
<i>You ain't dug near far enough</i>

01:46:07.921 --> 01:46:09.980
<i>Dig down deep inside yourself</i>

01:46:10.123 --> 01:46:12.114
<i>Find out What you need</i>

01:46:12.526 --> 01:46:15.518
