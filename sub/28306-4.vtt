00:00.934 --> 00:05.073
-(drumbeat)
-(clapping)

00:05.106 --> 00:07.075
-(rhythmic breathing)
-(drumroll)

00:07.108 --> 00:10.744
Fosse/Verdon. All new,
Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:11.945 --> 00:15.015
ANNOUNCER: FX presents
What We Do in the Shadows.

00:26.294 --> 00:29.263
Uh, the TA was asking about you
in the chem section.

00:29.297 --> 00:31.365
I said you were feeling a bit
under the weather.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.934
So I got you some, um...

00:33.967 --> 00:35.769
O... What...

00:35.803 --> 00:37.171
Os-Oscillio...

00:37.205 --> 00:40.074
Osclio...

00:40.108 --> 00:42.176
Oc-Occlio.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.278
-Oak-Oaknium.
-(flies buzzing)

00:44.312 --> 00:47.248
Oc-Occlioscosnium.

00:47.281 --> 00:48.449
Osio...

00:48.482 --> 00:50.284
Oscli... uh, Occlioco...

00:50.318 --> 00:51.785
Oscillococcinum, that's...

00:51.819 --> 00:53.087
that's the correct
pronunciation, there.

00:53.121 --> 00:55.589
So...

00:55.623 --> 00:57.057
take one of those.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.029
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.264
Siri,

01:03.297 --> 01:05.133
call 911.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.135
-SIRI: I'm not sure
I got that. Can you...
-Siri...

01:07.168 --> 01:09.036
She was fine last night.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.404
And then, this morning,

01:10.438 --> 01:12.473
she asked me to go
get her some NyQuil.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.074
And I said, "NyQuil?
Don't you mean DayQuil?

01:14.108 --> 01:16.076
Because then you're gonna
fall asleep."

01:16.110 --> 01:18.212
She said, "I want
to sleep all day." And then...

01:18.246 --> 01:20.648
and then I ended up getting some
oles-olescoleum.

01:20.681 --> 01:23.384
-Clecleum?
-Do you have a dorm advisor

01:23.417 --> 01:24.652
-or someone who can...
-(gasps)

01:24.685 --> 01:26.086
What the fuck?!

01:26.120 --> 01:27.621
I thought you said she was dead!

01:27.655 --> 01:29.423
Her vitals were at zero,
I checked them three times.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.292
Oh, my... I-I'm sorry.

01:31.325 --> 01:33.227
I'm so sorry, um...

01:33.261 --> 01:36.297
you should bill me because I'm
still on my parents' insurance.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.399
-Uh, ma'am, you were dead.
-I'm fine now, so...

01:38.432 --> 01:39.933
-(thunder rumbles)
-I'm fine. (laughs weakly)

01:39.967 --> 01:41.469
FEMALE PARAMEDIC:
I still think you should come

01:41.502 --> 01:44.104
-to the hospital, ma'am.
-Oh, no, no.

01:44.138 --> 01:45.506
I'm fine.

01:45.539 --> 01:46.907
MALE PARAMEDIC:
Ma'am, you are not fine.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.076
("You're Dead"
by Norma Tanega playing)

01:49.109 --> 01:51.579
* Don't sing if you want
to live long *

01:51.612 --> 01:54.081
* They have no use
for your song *

01:54.114 --> 01:56.750
* You're dead, you're dead,
you're dead *

01:56.784 --> 01:59.119
* You're dead
and out of this world *

02:01.155 --> 02:04.192
* Now your hope and compassion
is gone *

02:04.225 --> 02:06.994
* You sold out your dream
to the world *

02:07.027 --> 02:09.297
* Stay dead, stay dead,
stay dead *

02:09.330 --> 02:11.965
* You're dead
and out of this world. *

02:22.743 --> 02:24.645
GUILLERMO:
Was I disappointed

02:24.678 --> 02:27.715
I wasn't turned into a vampire?

02:27.748 --> 02:29.617
Yes. (chuckles)

02:29.650 --> 02:30.818
Heartbroken.

02:30.851 --> 02:33.654
But I think it's because...

02:33.687 --> 02:35.623
I need to learn patience.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.124
And my master's

02:37.157 --> 02:38.726
been really good to me lately.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.894
How is it looking, Guillermo?

02:40.928 --> 02:42.496
(Guillermo giggles)

02:42.530 --> 02:44.232
It looks like
I'm flying, Master.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.799
NANDOR:
Woo-hoo.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.335
Woo-hoo!

02:47.368 --> 02:49.337
I'm a vampire!
(laughs)

02:49.370 --> 02:50.704
You are not, though.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.640
LASZLO:
We have total dominion

02:52.673 --> 02:54.575
from here... to here.

02:54.608 --> 02:57.245
So that's two streets.

02:57.278 --> 02:59.880
Our street and Ashley's street.

02:59.913 --> 03:02.583
Yes. I lied a bit.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.918
Actually, it's from
there to there.

03:04.952 --> 03:07.921
So we have dominion
over five houses?

03:10.391 --> 03:12.560
We need to reach out
to some other vampires.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.862
Consider joining
dominions to secure

03:14.895 --> 03:16.364
our stranglehold
over the region.

03:16.397 --> 03:19.099
-Yes.
-Yes.

03:19.132 --> 03:20.901
Simon the Devious

03:20.934 --> 03:23.437
is a vampire we have known
for centuries.

03:23.471 --> 03:25.072
Our coffins were all together
on the ship

03:25.105 --> 03:26.874
that brought us over to America.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.109
We used to hide
down in the hole,

03:29.142 --> 03:31.245
then whisper jokes
to each other.

03:31.279 --> 03:33.781
Crawl around, tickle each other,
have a lovely time.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.849
And then we would
climb up to the top deck

03:35.883 --> 03:39.086
and just breathe in the sea air
and seduce and kill sailors.

03:39.119 --> 03:40.288
LASZLO:
We went to Staten Island,

03:40.321 --> 03:42.189
he went to Mana-hatta.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.791
And he very quickly became

03:43.824 --> 03:45.626
the king
of the Manhattan vampires.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.695
And he was only 107, which...

03:47.728 --> 03:50.398
You know, real boy wonder.
Very clever.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.932
He's not that clever.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.267
Okay, who's cleverer, then?

03:53.301 --> 03:55.068
-Stavros the Clever.
-(laughs)

03:55.102 --> 03:56.804
He died tripping on his cape

03:56.837 --> 03:59.440
at a wooden stake sale
at the garden center.

03:59.473 --> 04:02.743
Simon's HQ is this
fantastic nightclub

04:02.776 --> 04:04.612
called the Sassy Cat Club
in Mana-hatta.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.380
We used to go
all the time in the '20s.

04:06.414 --> 04:08.916
And we would do the Charleston

04:08.949 --> 04:11.652
and the Peabody, and we'd drink
some very nice blood

04:11.685 --> 04:13.220
from some very nice goblets.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.422
LASZLO:
You have to wear
a cape in there.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.957
Yes.
Everyone is in a cape.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.459
And if you don't wear a cape,

04:18.492 --> 04:20.060
you'll look like a
Fuck Me Knee-trembler.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.395
Laszlo!

04:21.429 --> 04:22.930
He's right, though.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.032
If you don't, you'd look like
a right little tart.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.268
How's this for the city?

04:28.302 --> 04:29.970
Oh, yes.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.806
You look like a beautiful
piece of wallpaper.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.107
It needs a cape.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.743
Hmm? Really?

04:35.776 --> 04:37.311
Yeah.
The bigger the better.

04:37.345 --> 04:39.513
(sighs)
Run.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.982
We're going into
the city tonight.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.284
We're going to party and dance

04:44.318 --> 04:47.988
and form a power alliance
with the Manhattan vampires

04:48.021 --> 04:50.758
so that we can crush the humans.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.293
No offense.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.429
I found it.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.297
Thoughts?

04:57.331 --> 04:58.766
Looks like it's alive.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.033
Good eye.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.002
It's 100% witch skin.

05:02.035 --> 05:04.338
Simon was always very jealous
of this hat.

05:04.372 --> 05:06.607
I can't wait to see
his face when I walk in.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.308
Please don't wear that hat.

05:08.342 --> 05:10.010
-Too stylish?
-No.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.479
It's a big,
bloody stupid hat with

05:11.512 --> 05:12.946
a big, bloody stupid
curse on it.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.147
And every time you wear it,

05:14.181 --> 05:16.517
something bloody
stupid terrible happens.

05:16.550 --> 05:19.553
-Nonsense. Gizmo likes it,
don't you?
-It's Guillermo.

05:19.587 --> 05:21.455
NADJA:
Laszlo's stupid hat.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.357
It's got a bloody huge
curse on it.

05:23.391 --> 05:25.693
I have tried to throw it out
many times,

05:25.726 --> 05:27.695
but it keeps crawling back.
Literally.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.329
I acquired this hat

05:29.363 --> 05:32.900
while draining the blood
of a Bavarian Hexenbrenner,

05:32.933 --> 05:34.502
or witch burner.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.637
He must've noticed me eyeing it,

05:36.670 --> 05:38.038
'cause in his dying breath,

05:38.071 --> 05:40.908
he said, "Take my hat, it's

05:40.941 --> 05:42.810
(groaning):
cuh..."

05:42.843 --> 05:44.712
"Yes, it is cool," I thought.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.313
Free hat.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.681
Even better.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.550
Think of all the things
that have happened.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.552
The potato famine,
that time that that horse

05:51.585 --> 05:53.387
knocked you over
and trampled over you.

05:53.421 --> 05:56.189
-No, it didn't.
-Then it started
making love to you?

05:56.223 --> 05:57.691
I don't consider that a curse.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.727
-It's growing human hair.
-Exactly.

05:59.760 --> 06:03.531
My new familiar, he likes it.
Don't you, Dustin?

06:03.564 --> 06:05.533
-JUSTIN: It's Justin.
-Yes, have a touch.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.738
That was our new familiar.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.240
Adieu.

06:13.273 --> 06:15.342
It's that bloody cursed hat,
Laszlo!

06:15.375 --> 06:17.377
It's got nothing to do with
the hat. It's the bookshelf.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.480
Which I charged you to fix.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.585
(coughs, grunts)

06:24.618 --> 06:26.720
This hat is not cursed.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.456
Oh, hey.

06:28.489 --> 06:31.692
Uh, I-I overheard that you might
be going to Manhattan.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.061
-I-I'd love to tag along.
-(hisses)

06:38.732 --> 06:40.300
NANDOR:
Ooh.

06:40.333 --> 06:43.136
Look at the skyline, Guillermo.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.705
GUILLERMO:
Yes, Master.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.940
Steady, Guillermo.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.309
It's a bit shaky.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.445
I don't want water on my cape.

06:51.479 --> 06:53.547
I'll have a soggy cape.

06:53.581 --> 06:55.483
Why are we stuck
in bloody traffic, Laszlo?

06:55.516 --> 06:56.950
-I don't know.
-Cursed hat.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.820
That man on the sidewalk
looks a bit sad. Curse.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.322
Why does this car smell bad?
It's the curse.

07:02.355 --> 07:03.657
Look, you can say that
all night.

07:03.691 --> 07:05.392
I'm gonna be wearing this hat.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.328
NANDOR:
I am a bit nervous
about seeing Simon.

07:08.361 --> 07:10.498
In the old days,
it would not have been my style

07:10.531 --> 07:11.965
to make an alliance.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.735
I would have slaughtered
my neighbors in battle.

07:14.768 --> 07:18.405
But then you wake up
and you think,

07:18.438 --> 07:20.974
"I've got no neighbors."

07:21.008 --> 07:22.275
(soft note plays)

07:22.309 --> 07:26.313
What if I want
to borrow something?

07:26.346 --> 07:27.948
I'm ready to make a change.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.083
My old boar.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.785
Barry.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.987
He's always smiling.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.489
Ready to make

07:35.523 --> 07:38.358
a friend.

07:38.391 --> 07:40.127
I'll do the talking.

07:40.160 --> 07:44.498
I invite you in.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.399
NANDOR:
Oh, it's so dingy.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.170
COLIN:
Everyone looks like Billy Idol.

07:50.203 --> 07:52.039
It's a sexy Marmaduke.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.440
This is lively.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.376
We are the only ones
wearing capes.

07:56.409 --> 07:58.378
Shall we look
for Simon the Devious?

07:58.411 --> 08:01.849
Let's mingle
until the others get here.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.350
Mingling...

08:03.383 --> 08:04.852
mingling.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.654
Mingling with you.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.489
-Hi.
-I-I'm gonna go look
for the bathroom.

08:09.523 --> 08:10.524
Oh, Guillermo.

08:10.558 --> 08:13.393
Be careful you don't
get-- pfft. (groans)

08:15.262 --> 08:17.230
Why don't you go and mingle?

08:17.264 --> 08:18.632
Oh, I don't think so.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.968
Uh, my stomach's feeling
a little iffy.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.502
Gas.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.538
So, I think I'll just
stick with you tonight.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.507
Okay.

08:27.541 --> 08:30.210
-Laszlo, what is taking so long?
-LASZLO: I say, cabbie.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.379
I've got my cape
caught in the door.

08:32.412 --> 08:34.414
-Well, yank it out.
-What the hell

08:34.447 --> 08:36.483
do you think I've been doing?

08:36.516 --> 08:38.518
(grunts)
Fuck...!

08:38.552 --> 08:40.721
You're fucking kidding.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.322
(grunts)

08:42.355 --> 08:44.391
You stay there.

08:44.424 --> 08:45.693
I'll come to you.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.895
-Oh, for fuck's sake!
-Oh, that bloody hat.

08:47.928 --> 08:50.363
Whoa! Fuck me.

08:50.397 --> 08:51.599
Fu...

08:51.632 --> 08:53.634
(club music pounding)

08:57.905 --> 08:59.907
(whirring)

09:01.074 --> 09:03.010
MAN:
You haven't tried that?

09:03.043 --> 09:04.878
It's like, one,
then two, then three.

09:04.912 --> 09:07.180
And then you get
where we are now.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.049
-But it's...
-(door shuts)

09:09.082 --> 09:10.951
Yeah.

09:10.984 --> 09:13.253
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.555
Colby.

09:15.589 --> 09:18.225
Familiar of Xanthos the Cruel
and Radenka the Brutal.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.961
-Ah.
-This is the familiar room.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.295
Yep.

09:22.329 --> 09:25.132
Amalta, Mischa, Jameson.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.467
-Sam.
-O-Oh, Sam is a...

09:27.500 --> 09:28.736
Sam's a familiar.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.105
Sam's a cat.
Guillermo, hi.

09:32.139 --> 09:34.441
Nandor the Relentless,
so, nice to meet you.

09:34.474 --> 09:36.710
Wait, Nandor the Relentless
of the Upper West Side?

09:36.744 --> 09:38.378
No, that's, uh,
Nancy the Relentless.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.813
People think...
W-We're Staten Island.

09:39.847 --> 09:42.215
Cool.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.652
NANDOR:
So you know, we have our street

09:44.685 --> 09:46.453
and also Ashley's street.

09:46.486 --> 09:49.056
You know, we've just, uh,
been busy over in Staten Island.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.558
-We're going to form
an alliance.
-(laughs) So tell me.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.227
Are you currently adjoined
to any other vampires?

09:54.261 --> 09:56.797
Uh, n-no. No, I...

09:56.830 --> 09:58.431
-Let's just go up
to the roof and...
-COLIN: Hey, hey.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.067
Do either of you two know

10:00.100 --> 10:02.569
what this building used to be?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.571
This building used to be owned

10:04.604 --> 10:06.840
by Hescher-Schmitz Farrier.

10:06.874 --> 10:09.843
A farrier deals
with equine foot care.

10:09.877 --> 10:11.611
Kind of a Nike for horses.

10:11.645 --> 10:14.081
Yes, everyone knows that.
Listen, Colin.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.149
Why must you come here
and interrupt me

10:16.183 --> 10:19.352
-when I am talking to...
-Who are you talking to, Nandor?

10:19.386 --> 10:20.620
It...

10:25.125 --> 10:27.027
What did...?

10:30.130 --> 10:31.999
-Fuck has happened in here?
-Oh, my...

10:32.032 --> 10:33.834
This is a travesty.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.602
What took you so long?

10:35.635 --> 10:37.604
His fucking stupid hat.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.006
Why aren't they wearing capes?

10:39.039 --> 10:41.842
Looks like anyone can be
a vampire in Mana-hatta.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.610
Look at him.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.612
Sod this, I'm gonna get a drink.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.447
So how long have you
been a familiar?

10:47.480 --> 10:49.182
You don't look very familiar.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.684
Ah. (laughs)

10:50.718 --> 10:53.220
I see what you did
there, but, uh, ten years.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.655
-Ten years? A decade.
-Yeah.

10:55.689 --> 10:58.191
It's considered being
an expert to some people.

10:58.225 --> 10:59.993
-All right. Okay.
-Which way is the bathroom?

11:00.027 --> 11:01.628
I'm here for the bathroom.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.064
-You're standing in it.
-Oh, is that what that is?

11:04.097 --> 11:07.000
Oh, the buckets. (chuckles)
They gave them to us when they

11:07.034 --> 11:08.168
thought we were
going to unionize.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.502
Do you not read the newsletter?

11:09.536 --> 11:11.304
There's a newsletter?

11:11.338 --> 11:13.540
-There is a newsletter.
-I can give you my e-mail.

11:13.573 --> 11:16.209
CHILD VAMPIRES:
Colby, it's time to leave.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.378
-Oh, those are your...
-Yeah, I'm their...

11:18.411 --> 11:20.080
I'm their familiar.
They're like, 400 years old

11:20.113 --> 11:22.182
but I have to play their parent,
I'm their "Dad"

11:22.215 --> 11:24.818
-so no one gets suspicious.
-VAMPIRES: Now, Colby.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.553
-Y-You better go.
-(Colby clears his throat)

11:26.586 --> 11:28.355
(low voice):
Let's go, kids.

11:28.388 --> 11:31.024
Daddy's coming.
Let's go.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.660
-(liquid pattering)
-Oh.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.729
Excuse me, Sam.

11:38.799 --> 11:41.434
All right, Big Vlad,
light me up.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.036
-CROWD (chanting): Simon! Simon!
-(laughs)

11:43.070 --> 11:45.272
This is insane.
Who would do this?

11:45.305 --> 11:46.706
-Simon! Simon! Simon! Simon!
-Are you ready for this?

11:46.740 --> 11:48.608
Abbadon, watch.
Are you watching?

11:48.641 --> 11:52.079
Oh, boy,
we are having fun tonight.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.781
-(laughs)
-(cheering)

11:53.814 --> 11:55.682
Don't look so scared.

11:55.715 --> 11:59.119
Understandably,
life is filled with mysteries.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.021
And for our next mystery...

12:01.054 --> 12:02.890
-Simon!
-Nadja?

12:02.923 --> 12:04.691
-MAN: (grunts) Hey!
-(laughs)

12:04.724 --> 12:06.794
Nadja!

12:06.827 --> 12:08.628
What a sight for sore eyes.

12:08.661 --> 12:11.965
-I haven't seen you in ages.
-Simon.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.566
Look at you.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.269
Don't you look wonderful?

12:16.303 --> 12:17.771
Fucking bloodle service.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.773
I wanted this five minutes ago.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.641
I'm talking to Nadja now.

12:21.674 --> 12:22.776
Please, please.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.813
So, what are you up to?

12:25.846 --> 12:28.748
Well, I'm, uh, uh, living in...
on the Staten Island.

12:28.782 --> 12:32.285
-Uh-huh...
-And things are going
very, very, very good.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.054
-Good? Good.
-Very good. Yes.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.723
Oh, I'm so happy to hear that,
'cause I worry about you.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.592
-Aw...
-Come, come, come,
come, come, come, come.

12:39.626 --> 12:42.595
You know, I worry about you
because I hear all these stories

12:42.629 --> 12:46.566
about all these vampires,
and they slowly spiral out

12:46.599 --> 12:50.070
and then they get stuck
in this real complacency.

12:50.103 --> 12:53.841
Then, eventually,
they just... fade away.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.843
-But not you.
-No way.

12:55.876 --> 12:58.278
You're-you're in Staten Island.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.180
-Well, yes.
-And Laszlo and Nandor?

13:00.213 --> 13:01.681
Have you spoken
to them recently?

13:01.714 --> 13:04.751
Uh, well, actually,
they're somewhere here.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.753
No!

13:06.786 --> 13:08.688
-Yes.
-Impossible!

13:08.721 --> 13:10.123
Well, we should
all have a drink.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.658
I would love to catch up
with those two rascals.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.862
Ah, there you are.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.497
Had my eye on you all night,
little one.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.699
-Oh, I-I, I'm just, uh...
-Yeah, whatever it is
you're "just,"

13:19.732 --> 13:22.669
you just found it right here.
Sweet release from life.

13:22.702 --> 13:25.805
-Uh, I like life.
And I'm just, uh...
-NANDOR: Guillermo.

13:25.839 --> 13:28.041
Oh.

13:28.075 --> 13:29.776
Something I can
help you with, friend?

13:29.809 --> 13:32.712
Uh, well, not really, but...

13:32.745 --> 13:35.182
Oh, were you gonna...
(growls)

13:35.215 --> 13:37.384
-No, no, no. No.
-'Cause I was thinking...
(growls)

13:37.417 --> 13:39.319
-Okay. Well, okay.
-Yeah?

13:39.352 --> 13:41.654
-I'd prefer it if you didn't.
-Why?

13:41.688 --> 13:44.324
He's kind of my familiar.

13:44.357 --> 13:45.859
-How could I know? (chuckles)
-No, I...

13:45.893 --> 13:47.327
No, honest mistake.
Y-You don't have to apologize.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.529
-I will. I must apologize,
I'm so sorry. I-I...
-Fine, honestly,

13:49.562 --> 13:51.531
look, if you really had
your heart set on it,

13:51.564 --> 13:52.632
-don't let me stand in your way.
-Well, I'd love to...
-GUILLERMO: What?

13:52.665 --> 13:54.167
Not at all.
This is my discourtesy.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.403
-and I feel bad.
-I mean, I'm okay with it if...

13:56.436 --> 13:58.906
-I mean, you can if you like.
-No. No. No. I do apologize.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.908
-Cheers. Okay? Rock and roll.
-Yes.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.842
Wow!

14:02.876 --> 14:05.512
No, I wasn't going
to let him eat you.

14:08.215 --> 14:10.417
Guillermo!

14:12.886 --> 14:15.022
Simon The Devious will see you.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.856
Okay. Great. Uh,

14:16.890 --> 14:18.658
-your hat is bleeding.
-I know.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.160
SIMON:
You must

14:20.193 --> 14:23.263
kill someone in the Hamptons.
It's just...

14:23.296 --> 14:25.198
Laszlo! Nandor?

14:25.232 --> 14:28.701
Aren't you a sight
for sore eyes?

14:28.735 --> 14:30.837
NANDOR:
Pleasure to see
you again, Simon.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.373
SIMON:
And look at you.
Nadja said you're doing well.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.608
And now I see you in your capes,

14:35.642 --> 14:39.179
and I think "Well, you haven't
lost your senses of humor."

14:39.212 --> 14:42.349
-You're married?
-LASZLO and NADJA: Yes.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.783
SIMON:
Well, your behavior with me
did not preclude you

14:43.816 --> 14:45.285
-to be married.
-LASZLO: Oh, no, no, no, no.

14:45.318 --> 14:48.755
I had forgotten because of her
physical behavior with me.

14:48.788 --> 14:51.758
Oh, when was the last time
we were all together?

14:51.791 --> 14:54.861
The bicentennial, 1976.

14:54.894 --> 14:59.032
Yes, you told that joke
about that group of sailors.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.400
Yes. Uh,

15:00.433 --> 15:03.703
"It's like a virtual
smorgasbord of seamen"?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.138
(laughing)

15:09.642 --> 15:12.179
That's it.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.584
But I haven't even introduced
you to my crew,

15:17.617 --> 15:19.319
the Leather Skins.

15:19.352 --> 15:22.122
Of course,
that's Big Vlad behind you.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.291
Abbadon, Empusa.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.826
We've got the Freak sisters
over there,

15:26.859 --> 15:28.761
they're two sisters
and they are not related.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.330
That's Little Vlad.

15:30.363 --> 15:31.764
The guy's a fucking maniac.

15:31.798 --> 15:34.001
We've got Mister 50s.

15:34.034 --> 15:37.304
We've got S, and that's because
her name is Sarah.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.239
We've got Evil Steve.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.474
Freakfest Tony. Ah!

15:41.508 --> 15:44.011
There he is,
Blavglad the Exsanguinator.

15:44.044 --> 15:47.580
And, of course, The Silent One.

15:47.614 --> 15:48.948
(quietly):
Hey.

15:48.982 --> 15:51.018
SIMON:
We keep going over there,

15:51.051 --> 15:52.852
we've got Asian Mike.
And that's Chunt.

15:52.885 --> 15:55.622
Jane the Soulless, Elgrad the
Fifth, Horvok the Pit Master.

15:55.655 --> 15:59.259
Gonthrapal
and his brother Krylsac.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.860
It's Wesley Sykes.

16:00.893 --> 16:03.930
-Desdemona the Shrieker.
-(shrieks)

16:03.963 --> 16:05.132
Yes.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.133
There's Len, my accountant.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.867
And of course, Count Rapula.

16:07.900 --> 16:11.104
* 300 years livin'
in New York, son *

16:11.138 --> 16:14.174
* I didn't start rhyming
till 1991. *

16:14.207 --> 16:15.708
SIMON:
Yes, he just started rapping

16:15.742 --> 16:17.777
in 1991.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.947
Yes, well, um, this is our crew.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.183
There's Nandor.
My good lady-wife Nadja,

16:23.216 --> 16:25.885
who you clearly know.
And my good self.

16:25.918 --> 16:27.954
-We like to keep things slim.
-COLIN: Hi, everyone.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.224
I'm... I'm-I'm also with them.

16:31.258 --> 16:32.559
-SIMON: Who is he?
-No one.

16:32.592 --> 16:33.826
COLIN:
I'm with them.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.862
Now, we've all known each other
long enough

16:35.895 --> 16:37.697
to know that this is not
a mere social visit.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.699
You are not wrong.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.369
Um, you may have heard that, uh,

16:42.402 --> 16:45.372
we have the Baron
visiting with us.

16:45.405 --> 16:49.176
The Baron came to visit you
in Staten Island?

16:49.209 --> 16:51.411
NADJA:
Yes. We were thinking,
as we have dominion

16:51.444 --> 16:53.246
-over Staten Island...
-Uh-huh.

16:53.280 --> 16:56.983
...and you, Simon, you control
a lot of Manhattan, well...

16:57.016 --> 16:58.585
-I do.
-LASZLO: Yes, uh,

16:58.618 --> 17:01.088
I mean, there's talk we could
possibly join forces,

17:01.121 --> 17:03.723
take the lion's share
of New York City.

17:03.756 --> 17:08.061
Uh, which also includes our
street and also Ashley Street.

17:08.095 --> 17:11.498
So, I would bring Manhattan
to the table,

17:11.531 --> 17:13.900
and you would bring...

17:13.933 --> 17:15.001
Our street and...

17:15.034 --> 17:16.069
NADJA and NANDOR:
Ashley Street.

17:16.103 --> 17:17.904
-SIMON ...and Ashley Street.
-Correct.
-Yes.

17:17.937 --> 17:20.006
Well, that sounds
very interesting.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.241
Oh, ooh.

17:21.274 --> 17:22.442
SIMON:
So I guess I would begin

17:22.475 --> 17:25.212
the negotiation by...

17:25.245 --> 17:27.380
you giving me that hat.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.782
Oh, I fucking knew
this would happen.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.284
-Absolutely not.
-NADJA: Laszlo.

17:31.318 --> 17:33.453
Simon, you don't want the hat.
It's not a good hat.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.522
-No...
-Give him the hat.
-No.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.257
SIMON:
I watched you
walk around that ship

17:37.290 --> 17:40.593
always wearing that hat
and thinking,

17:40.627 --> 17:43.029
"This vampire
doesn't deserve this hat.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.597
I deserve that hat."

17:44.631 --> 17:46.733
Well, I'll tell you something,
if you want this hat,

17:46.766 --> 17:48.435
you'll have to cut my head off.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.803
-Laszlo.
-That's fine.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.706
Big Vlad, right behind you,
has a machete.

17:53.740 --> 17:57.210
He could take it, or perhaps
we could get The Silent One,

17:57.244 --> 17:59.746
or Little Vlad,
he's a fucking maniac.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.449
And if we could hit Mister 50s,
maybe he could help,

18:02.482 --> 18:05.118
-or the Exsanguinator himself.
-(hissing)

18:05.152 --> 18:07.053
Or, let's see,
fucking everybody here.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.589
All right, all right, you've
made your point. Get off me.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.791
Take the fucking hat.

18:11.824 --> 18:14.594
Ah, thank you. Mm.

18:14.627 --> 18:15.962
What is it that's
sort of puckering

18:15.995 --> 18:17.964
and sucking
at the back of my head?

18:17.997 --> 18:19.266
NADJA and LASZLO:
It's witch's asshole.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.501
Oh, yes.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.570
Well, now that I've got the hat,

18:23.603 --> 18:26.639
-I can say, um,
get them out of here.
-What?

18:26.673 --> 18:29.075
-LASZLO: What?
-You can get the fuck out!

18:29.108 --> 18:31.844
Get out of my club!

18:31.878 --> 18:33.513
-Oh...
-SIMON: I summoned you here

18:33.546 --> 18:37.150
to get your hat, and now it is
time for you to leave.

18:37.184 --> 18:38.785
(beatboxing)

18:38.818 --> 18:40.687
* Hey, yo, it's time to go *

18:40.720 --> 18:43.523
* So hit the exit,
my rhyme flow's so sick *

18:43.556 --> 18:45.758
-* It's on some next shit... *
-Yeah!

18:45.792 --> 18:49.362
-Humiliating.
-SIMON: Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

18:49.396 --> 18:51.998
By the way, we don't
validate parking.

18:52.031 --> 18:53.933
Not that you have a car,

18:53.966 --> 18:56.836
-because you are failures
of vampires
-Lazlo, don't...

18:56.869 --> 19:00.273
in your pathetic, lame capes.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.609
This hat-- it makes me feel
like Robin Hood.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.477
Big Vlad, my bow.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.346
-Touch the sky.
-Touch the sky.

19:06.379 --> 19:07.980
He's a big silly dickhead.

19:08.014 --> 19:10.317
I don't remember him
being so devious.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.151
I mean, he is called
Simon The Devious.

19:12.185 --> 19:14.387
-Shit!
-Shit! Oh, shit!

19:14.421 --> 19:16.055
Fucking hell.
Darling?

19:16.088 --> 19:18.691
-Yes?
-I think my hat's
probably cursed.

19:18.725 --> 19:22.395
Bat!

19:22.429 --> 19:23.663
Oh...

19:27.900 --> 19:29.569
Guillermo.

19:29.602 --> 19:30.970
(mouths)

19:31.003 --> 19:33.005
Guillermo?

19:37.109 --> 19:39.078
You're still angry
about that vampire

19:39.111 --> 19:40.513
who tried to eat you,
aren't you?

19:40.547 --> 19:42.882
-Yes.
-Don't deny it. I can tell.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.685
-I said yes.
-See, I knew it.

19:45.718 --> 19:48.355
Guillermo...

19:48.388 --> 19:51.090
I'm sorry for
how I treated you tonight.

19:51.123 --> 19:53.326
I appreciate you.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.927
I really do.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.831
Well, you have a funny way
of showing it sometimes.

19:58.865 --> 20:01.434
Thank you.
But...

20:01.468 --> 20:05.071
I'm going to
make it up to you tonight.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.580
GUILLERMO:
This is amazing, Master.

20:13.613 --> 20:16.883
Enjoy it, Guillermo.
You're really flying.

20:16.916 --> 20:19.286
This is the best night
of my life!

20:19.319 --> 20:22.755
Oh, that's quite sad,
but also quite beautiful.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.592
-I feel like a real vampire.
-Don't push it.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.093
-What's that over there?
-Where?

20:27.126 --> 20:28.728
The Empire State Building,
I think.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.129
Is that it right there?

20:30.162 --> 20:31.564
-What, over...
-Aah!

20:31.598 --> 20:33.266
Oops.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.934
-(crash)
-Shit.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.869
-(groaning)
-NANDOR: Shh, Guillermo.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.471
-Don't trouble yourself.
-(monitor beeping steadily)

20:38.505 --> 20:40.307
He was fortunate.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.809
A thicket of trees tangled him
up, and then he landed

20:42.842 --> 20:46.145
on the roof
of an abandoned food truck.

20:47.179 --> 20:49.048
I want you to know

20:49.081 --> 20:52.819
that you are my...

20:52.852 --> 20:54.587
friend.

20:54.621 --> 20:57.424
-Hmm...
-Ugh, no,
that didn't feel right.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.792
You will forget I said anything.

20:59.826 --> 21:02.128
Shall we?

21:02.161 --> 21:05.932
Hold your Horlicks--
that's my bloody hat.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.267
Is that you in there, Simon?

21:08.301 --> 21:11.871
Well, I'm gonna take my hat
back, you crispy piece of shit.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.541
(monitor flatlines)

21:16.676 --> 21:18.945
-(monitor beeping steadily)
-(Guillermo whimpers)

21:18.978 --> 21:22.148
(monitor flatlines)

21:22.181 --> 21:23.316
-(monitor beeping steadily)
-(Guillermo moaning)

21:23.350 --> 21:26.353
Eh.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.664
* I like to think when
I'm looking out the window *

21:37.697 --> 21:40.667
* Step back and maybe look
at the sunrise *

21:40.700 --> 21:42.669
-* So remember me *
-* Oh *

21:42.702 --> 21:44.704
-* Another moment
that will never be *
-* Oh *

21:44.737 --> 21:47.707
* And take the time
to make some sense *

21:47.740 --> 21:50.710
* And think about
the consequence *

21:50.743 --> 21:52.712
* When I'm looking at you,
when you're looking at me *

21:52.745 --> 21:55.715
* Wonder what it would be,
wonder what it could be *

21:55.748 --> 21:58.985
* I like to think when
I'm looking out the window *

21:59.018 --> 22:01.721
* Like to think when I'm
looking out the window *

22:01.754 --> 22:04.724
* Window, window, oh *

22:04.757 --> 22:06.726
* Window, window. *

22:13.766 --> 22:15.234
I would like
some of that glitter.

22:15.267 --> 22:17.036
Whatever for, Master?

22:17.069 --> 22:19.238
I'm going to sprinkle it
on my face and on my body,

22:20.272 --> 22:21.340
like Twilight.
