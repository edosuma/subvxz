NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.545 --> 00:05.505
Hey, everybody. Okay.

00:05.588 --> 00:08.049
-You wanna...
-Wait a minute, he's drunk.

00:08.133 --> 00:13.346
I commit over a dozen men,
two precincts, and nearly $80,000,

00:13.430 --> 00:15.724
and you show up plastered to the gills.

00:15.807 --> 00:17.767
I went from a fifth a day
to nearly seven--

00:17.851 --> 00:19.019
-I don't wanna hear it.
-You don't understand--

00:19.102 --> 00:21.021
As of this moment,
pending an investigation,

00:21.104 --> 00:22.522
you're assigned to the motor pool.

00:22.605 --> 00:25.442
I threw a ham at your mother once.
Nobody liked the barbecues.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.152
Well, you're gonna come, anyway.

00:27.527 --> 00:30.864
And there's gonna be potato salad,
and coleslaw,

00:31.114 --> 00:34.325
and you're gonna sit at a table
and talk to your kids, damn it.

00:34.409 --> 00:36.411
You were tellin' me
everything is solid on that end.

00:36.494 --> 00:40.206
I don't think my old man could care less
if he ever saw my face again.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.834
NARRATOR:
<i>And now, tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:42.917 --> 00:45.378
(growls)

00:45.462 --> 00:49.591
The police department makes
95,000 arrests a year like Mr. Pagano,

00:49.674 --> 00:53.762
and we've got room for only 700 trials.
So we'll plea-bargain him at any cost!

00:53.845 --> 00:56.431
Hey, Pop, how's it going?
You feeling all right?

00:56.514 --> 00:59.350
If I was feeling all right,
I wouldn't be here.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.478
We're gonna keep him here
with us a while longer, Mr. Renko.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.688
During the time that we were married,

01:03.772 --> 01:07.025
did you ever think I might be gay?

01:07.108 --> 01:09.903
I've had it. I am quitting the force.

01:10.403 --> 01:11.821
Frank, I'm going to quit.

01:11.905 --> 01:15.450
The fact is, I've been considering
an early retirement myself.

01:15.533 --> 01:18.870
What is it around here today, Phil?
Is there something in the water?

01:19.746 --> 01:21.623
Police! Freeze it right there!

01:21.706 --> 01:23.541
-You're under arrest, pal.
-I can explain.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.501
Save it.

01:27.337 --> 01:30.006
(murmuring, chattering)

01:30.090 --> 01:32.133
PHIL: Item Six. Hats.

01:32.842 --> 01:35.136
I hold here a repeat Divisional memo

01:35.220 --> 01:38.765
concerning this precinct's
undying infatuation

01:38.848 --> 01:40.350
for non-regulation headgear.

01:40.433 --> 01:41.267
(chattering, groaning)

01:41.351 --> 01:44.020
Particularly those kinds
of cranial adornments...

01:44.104 --> 01:47.023
featuring display-type advertising

01:47.107 --> 01:50.485
and, uh, maxims of questionable
philosophical value,

01:50.568 --> 01:53.655
such as, "Cops Love A Big Bust."

01:53.738 --> 01:56.825
(laughter)

01:56.908 --> 02:02.038
This standard octagonal,
navy blue police chapeau

02:02.455 --> 02:06.751
satisfies all requirements set down
in departmental uniform code.

02:07.335 --> 02:12.507
Beginning today, all personnel will be
seen conducting business in said chapeau.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.300
It's a dinosaur, Sarge!

02:14.384 --> 02:17.011
Now, you were all issued one
in the dim, distant past.

02:17.095 --> 02:21.182
I suggest you rescue it from whatever
purgatory it has been banished to

02:21.266 --> 02:23.434
and put it to its appropriate use.

02:23.852 --> 02:28.398
And this goes for those patrol persons
known for wearing no headgear whatsoever.

02:28.481 --> 02:31.901
Oh, we're gonna look like we're in them
old training films or something.

02:32.277 --> 02:34.904
PHIL: Let's tell the good guys
from the bad guys, huh, folks?

02:34.988 --> 02:37.198
-RENKO: Okay.
-PHIL: Item Seven.

02:37.282 --> 02:40.577
The biannual flying circus and brain fry.

02:40.785 --> 02:45.707
Re: Annual promotions is over.
From Hill Street, they are...

02:46.207 --> 02:50.336
Patrolman Wilbur Covello to sergeant.
Patrolman Enrique Garcia to sergeant.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.423
-Detective Sergeant Alf Chesley...
-Hey!

02:53.506 --> 02:54.674
PHIL: ...to lieutenant.

02:55.049 --> 02:57.594
-All right!
-PHIL: Congratulations all around.

02:59.137 --> 03:01.222
Continuing onwards. Item Eight.

03:02.140 --> 03:05.810
The following names are to report
for plainclothes assignment

03:06.269 --> 03:11.774
in this room in one half hour:
Hill, Renko, Borellis, Smiljanich.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.109
Item Nine.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.070
In regard to an operation

03:16.154 --> 03:18.656
under the direction
of Detectives Belker and Washington,

03:18.740 --> 03:22.452
the following names are to see them
immediately after roll:

03:22.702 --> 03:26.456
Bates, Coffey, Paswaugh,
Osborne, Van Dusen, Morgan.

03:26.539 --> 03:32.086
This latter assignment relates
to, uh, a rash of auto thefts

03:32.170 --> 03:37.634
afflicting Hill area garages
these past several months.

03:37.842 --> 03:41.679
In excess of 200 vehicles
have fallen prey to this plague,

03:41.763 --> 03:45.975
not the least of which being one
1959 baby blue, mint condition

03:46.351 --> 03:50.480
Buick Electra 225 convertible
belonging to yours truly,

03:50.563 --> 03:53.942
stolen from the Selano Avenue
shopping mall garage last night.

03:54.692 --> 03:59.739
I for one fail to understand the nature
of such heinous behavior.

04:00.365 --> 04:04.494
To deprive a man of his basic mobility...

04:05.078 --> 04:09.040
is no less terrible than
to physically maim the man himself.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.585
Now, these captains of modern piracy
cannot be tolerated.

04:12.669 --> 04:17.173
I heartily encourage those
assigned to this mission...

04:17.257 --> 04:21.386
to pursue it with the fervor
of a holy crusade.

04:22.053 --> 04:25.348
-Justice must be done.
-(Belker growling)

04:25.431 --> 04:26.849
(cheering)

04:26.933 --> 04:28.768
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.437
-And let's be careful out there.
-MAN: As always!

04:31.813 --> 04:34.482
PHIL: And remember those hats.

04:39.779 --> 04:44.492
Now, how much am I offered for this
scrupulously-maintained example...

04:44.575 --> 04:46.244
of prehistoric police wear,

04:46.452 --> 04:48.955
which I will not, I repeat,
not be wearing today?

04:49.414 --> 04:52.750
Seven and seven-eighths?
I could fall in and hurt myself.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.920
Alf, my man, you have arrived.
Right on, brother.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.756
-Right on.
-Lieutenant Alfred Chesley.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.135
Hey, that's great, Alf. It's about time.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.889
-Congratulations, Alf.
-Thanks, Henry.

05:19.444 --> 05:20.737
Teamwork, Bobby.

05:21.195 --> 05:24.240
When there's an objective to be won,
go in strength.

05:24.324 --> 05:28.161
-Sir?
-Nice work snagging that lieutenantship.

05:28.536 --> 05:31.205
It was Alf Chesley that got
the promotion, Lieutenant.

05:31.289 --> 05:35.335
And to think that that good man
might have been passed over again...

05:35.710 --> 05:41.758
if it hadn't been for your--
your, uh, Black Officers Presidium?

05:42.759 --> 05:43.593
Coalition.

05:43.676 --> 05:47.180
By golly, that's what I call
reading the terrain.

05:47.805 --> 05:50.475
This is the day and age
of political clout.

05:50.725 --> 05:54.479
Individual competence and merits
are only factors nowadays.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.689
If you wanna get where you're going,

05:56.939 --> 06:01.194
you have to associate yourself
with a well-heeled infrastructure.

06:02.320 --> 06:06.657
And your type are way ahead
in that kind of thinking.

06:06.741 --> 06:07.658
I got a meeting.

06:07.992 --> 06:13.289
I have been thinking about building up
a political front along similar lines.

06:13.831 --> 06:17.585
Police Officers
Against Regression and Decay.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.838
P.O.A.R.D.

06:21.297 --> 06:22.924
Now, what do you think of that, huh?

06:25.760 --> 06:26.594
(yells)

06:26.677 --> 06:28.930
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

06:29.389 --> 06:31.057
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

06:31.140 --> 06:35.019
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:35.103 --> 06:36.854
(sirens wailing)

06:42.318 --> 06:46.239
(theme music playing)

08:12.742 --> 08:15.411
I understand and support the reasons
why it was done, Frank.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.498
Sure. Let's make up for all
the injustices of the past.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.249
But let me tell you.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.002
When you're on the dirty end of the stick,

08:23.211 --> 08:25.213
when you've stayed up nights
till 2:00 in the morning studying

08:25.296 --> 08:28.508
and you whip through the exam
in nothing flat, it hurts like hell.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.800
Henry, it'll happen.

08:30.843 --> 08:33.429
When? When? Next time around?
Two years from now?

08:34.305 --> 08:36.599
Maybe then, the department'll want a--
a woman lieutenant,

08:36.682 --> 08:37.850
or a handicapped lieutenant.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.145
I deserved it this time, Frank.

08:42.563 --> 08:45.233
I was ready and I was able.
I can't do any better than that.

08:48.027 --> 08:48.861
I don't know.

08:49.237 --> 08:50.947
If they're not gonna promote me,
I'm wasting my time.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.198
Maybe I oughta pack it in.

08:52.281 --> 08:53.741
I don't think so, Henry.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.953
You're too smart
and you're too resourceful.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.579
Don't soap me, Frank, please.

09:01.749 --> 09:04.961
Look, I'm sorry if this sounds petty,
but under the circumstances,

09:05.044 --> 09:07.088
I don't wanna sit around here all day
pushing a pencil...

09:07.171 --> 09:09.757
and watching Alf Chesley
collect his "attaboys".

09:09.840 --> 09:12.468
So if you could give me an assignment--

09:13.135 --> 09:15.179
See Ray about Operation Hookslide.

09:15.263 --> 09:16.097
Okay.

09:25.022 --> 09:27.984
I just wanted to say, Henry,
I'm sorry you didn't make lieutenant.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.111
We all go through
these disappointments, Alf.

09:30.194 --> 09:32.947
The promotion board picked you over me.
I'm sure they had their reasons.

09:33.030 --> 09:36.200
Maybe my test scores weren't the greatest
to come down the road, Henry.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.327
But there's all kinds of education.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.956
Some of the best kind, they don't ask you
about on a lieutenant's exam.

09:42.039 --> 09:44.417
Look, Alf, nobody's saying
you didn't deserve your promotion.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.168
But I've been waiting for this one.

09:46.836 --> 09:50.464
You're a good man, Henry,
but you don't know nothing about waiting.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.009
I've waited 14 years for this one.

09:53.467 --> 09:54.927
Fourteen long years.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.305
So I don't care
how I got to be a lieutenant.

09:57.555 --> 09:58.723
I'll be a damn good one.

09:59.765 --> 10:02.852
I'm sure you will, Alf.
If I implied any differently, I'm sorry.

10:03.311 --> 10:06.063
Don't worry, Henry.
You'll make it next time around.

10:09.066 --> 10:13.154
Yeah, stolen last night.
'59 Buick Electra 225 Convertible.

10:13.237 --> 10:15.656
MAN (over phone):
<i>All right, I'll go check the file.</i>

10:15.740 --> 10:17.033
He's going for the file.

10:18.367 --> 10:21.537
Walnut grain dash and door inserts.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.706
-Six hundred dollars.
-(exhales)

10:23.789 --> 10:26.000
-Excellent craftsmanship.
-A shame.

10:26.542 --> 10:29.170
Police interceptor engine.
A thousand over.

10:30.171 --> 10:34.508
MAN (over phone):<i> Luckily, sir,</i>
<i>I can give you $2,800 for your loss.</i>

10:34.759 --> 10:37.470
Twenty-eight hundred dollars?

10:38.137 --> 10:40.681
-You can't be serious!
<i>-</i>MAN:<i> It's depreciated quite a bit.</i>

10:41.766 --> 10:43.934
Don't talk to me about depreciation.

10:44.018 --> 10:47.605
The car was immaculate.
You could eat off the engine.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.107
There's not a spot on my garage floor.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.984
You-- I'll show it to you!

10:54.779 --> 10:57.948
No, I will not come and pick up the check.
You bring it to me...

10:58.366 --> 11:01.160
so I can depreciate your face and limbs.

11:02.036 --> 11:02.870
(slams phone down)

11:02.953 --> 11:05.331
Sure, I'll pick you up.
Whose courtroom you in?

11:06.165 --> 11:08.793
"Let 'Em Go" Mo. Yeah, I'll be there.

11:08.876 --> 11:11.420
Right. Bye. I do, too. See ya.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.547
-Yes, Ray?
-Look at this.

11:14.924 --> 11:15.758
Look at this.

11:16.050 --> 11:21.013
They say they've been taking out less than
required on my FICA for five years.

11:21.472 --> 11:24.892
Now, I open my pay envelope,
and between the withholding,

11:25.184 --> 11:29.397
my credit union deductions, and now this,
do you know what I'm left with?

11:30.231 --> 11:32.024
Nine dollars and nine cents!

11:32.650 --> 11:35.319
I've had it. I am quitting the force.

11:35.403 --> 11:36.529
Ray, you're not quitting.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.199
I can't even make
my car payment this month!

11:40.449 --> 11:41.826
Well, at least you have a car.

11:43.452 --> 11:46.414
Ray, call Mildred Kleinman
down at Division.

11:46.497 --> 11:47.581
She's very understanding.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.834
I'm sure she'll spread out
your payments for you.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.043
Bureaucrats.

11:52.128 --> 11:55.673
The bureaucracy
is going to destroy us all, Frank.

11:55.756 --> 11:56.966
Mark my words!

11:57.341 --> 11:59.719
You know, Francis,
I hate to burden you with this right now,

11:59.802 --> 12:04.181
but the fact is, I've been considering
an early retirement myself.

12:05.307 --> 12:08.394
What is it around here today, Phil?
Is there something in the water?

12:09.145 --> 12:10.354
My car was stolen.

12:11.355 --> 12:12.273
The Buick?

12:12.356 --> 12:14.608
Yeah, right out of the Selano Avenue
shopping mall.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.653
Corinthian leather seat covers,
tinted glass,

12:17.737 --> 12:21.073
in-dash stereo cassette
with a four-channel synthesizer.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.118
You could sit in the backseat
and catch all the lows.

12:24.493 --> 12:27.329
(sighs) Phil, I'm sorry about your car.

12:27.913 --> 12:30.416
But you're not retiring
just because somebody stole it.

12:30.499 --> 12:33.753
It's symptomatic
of a far greater deterioration.

12:34.336 --> 12:35.713
Do you know in Eugene, Oregon,

12:35.796 --> 12:38.674
you can walk the streets
at night with virtual safety?

12:38.883 --> 12:42.261
You can go to bed at night
with your front door unlocked.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.680
Quality of life, Francis.

12:44.764 --> 12:48.684
Well, the quality of life around here
would decline precipitously, Phil,

12:48.768 --> 12:49.935
if you threw in the towel.

12:51.562 --> 12:55.608
You don't understand, Francis.
They stole my Buick.

13:00.738 --> 13:03.240
MAN: Number seven on the calendar.
Rene Pagano,

13:03.324 --> 13:06.202
charged with 140.20, burglary,

13:06.285 --> 13:09.830
140.30, possession of burglar's tools.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.708
Your Honor, this case is on
for a bail application.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.504
The defendant also has a prior burglary
on which he jumped bail.

13:16.921 --> 13:21.300
Your Honor, this is apparently
Mr. Pagano's 11th arrest for burglary.

13:21.383 --> 13:24.094
He also skipped bail on one prior charge.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.639
This is, uh, a very strong case.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.224
You tell the dude, right,

13:28.307 --> 13:30.768
if I could get a drug program,
then I could kick the habit.

13:30.851 --> 13:32.186
I don't have to steal no more.

13:32.770 --> 13:35.523
You flunked out of your last drug program,
didn't you, Rene?

13:35.606 --> 13:36.982
Who are you for, me or the cop?

13:37.399 --> 13:39.401
Man, that other program
was bogus, you know?

13:39.735 --> 13:44.824
It's apparent to our office that
Mr. Pagano is a career criminal,

13:45.157 --> 13:47.952
a complete failure at everything in life
except burglary,

13:48.244 --> 13:50.704
and exactly the sort of completely
untrustworthy person

13:50.788 --> 13:52.790
who should be incarcerated at all costs.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.918
JUDGE: Ms. Davenport, any response...

13:56.502 --> 13:58.504
to this rather stinging indictment?

13:59.171 --> 14:01.674
Now, you tell the dude I
got my mother, right? She's sick.

14:02.216 --> 14:04.009
No, Your Honor. Not really.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.011
-PAGANO: You're not gonna say nothin'?
-No?

14:06.470 --> 14:08.514
What you mean, no? You're my P.D., man.

14:09.098 --> 14:12.268
You know how many lying little scum
like you I get off the hook every day?

14:12.351 --> 14:13.310
Lying scum?

14:13.686 --> 14:15.855
Yo, Your Honor, man,
she called me a lying scum!

14:15.938 --> 14:17.398
You got that?
I don't want no more public defender.

14:17.481 --> 14:18.774
I want a real lawyer.

14:18.899 --> 14:21.068
Give me somebody like F. Lee Bailey,

14:21.151 --> 14:23.153
-Perry Mason, Melvin, uh--
-JUDGE: Silence.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.572
-Silence, Pagano.
-PAGANO: I want one of those guys.

14:24.655 --> 14:25.489
PAGANO: You got it?

14:25.573 --> 14:29.535
Ms. Davenport, do you have some kind
of trouble with this client?

14:30.536 --> 14:31.370
Your Honor,

14:32.162 --> 14:34.540
the D.A.'s barely finished looking
at his papers,

14:34.623 --> 14:38.002
and he's calling Mr. Pagano
the worst degenerate since Rasputin.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.087
Now I'm supposed to tell you

14:40.170 --> 14:42.631
that Mr. Pagano loves his mother
and hates drugs,

14:42.715 --> 14:44.717
and all he needs is one more chance.

14:45.092 --> 14:47.511
You're an advocate, Ms. Davenport.

14:48.012 --> 14:51.348
The truth is, if I saw Mr. Pagano
coming down the street,

14:51.682 --> 14:54.310
I'd cross to the other side
and get my mace can ready.

14:54.393 --> 14:57.229
Ms. Davenport, you're treading
on very dangerous ground.

14:57.313 --> 15:01.400
And putting aside my personal response
to Mr. Pagano,

15:01.650 --> 15:03.903
the fact that he insults me by the minute,

15:04.069 --> 15:06.947
the fact that I never saw him in my life
till 20 minutes ago,

15:07.031 --> 15:09.867
we're never going to know whether
Mr. Pagano did anything or not...

15:09.950 --> 15:11.869
because,
as everyone in this courtroom knows,

15:11.952 --> 15:16.165
the police department makes
95,000 arrests a year like Mr. Pagano,

15:17.333 --> 15:19.376
but we've got room for only 700 trials.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.462
So we'll plea-bargain him at any cost!

15:21.545 --> 15:23.422
Oh, man. Judge, give me another lawyer.

15:25.799 --> 15:29.303
Ms. Davenport,
you're extremely close to contempt.

15:29.386 --> 15:32.723
Joyce, come on.
This is only number seven on the calendar.

15:33.599 --> 15:34.934
You know my advice to you, Rene?

15:36.185 --> 15:38.145
You're part of the system.
Keep on playing.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.023
Cop to three months, maybe six.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.651
You'll do okay.
The system's got a place for you.

15:44.318 --> 15:48.864
But if you'll excuse me, Your Honor,
I'm feeling terribly out of place today.

15:48.948 --> 15:52.326
(crowd chattering)

15:57.790 --> 16:02.002
We'll be working Washington Heights,
and their guys will be working the Hill.

16:02.753 --> 16:06.840
Borellis, unit four,
the 6000 block of Lasky Avenue.

16:07.841 --> 16:10.844
Renko, unit five, the 7000 block.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.389
It's a simple con.

16:14.223 --> 16:18.268
The young woman impersonating a hooker...
takes the john to a hotel room,

16:18.811 --> 16:20.270
gets his clothes off,

16:20.896 --> 16:25.359
then her two accomplices bust in
and identify themselves as vice cops.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.362
After scaring the hell out of the mark,

16:29.029 --> 16:32.241
they agree to let him post
a cash-in-advance bond.

16:32.866 --> 16:36.328
The guy's usually so grateful,
he pays without a protest.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.955
Are the two men armed, Lieutenant?

16:38.288 --> 16:41.041
Yes, they are,
and should be considered dangerous.

16:41.709 --> 16:45.004
Your backup units will stay
as close to you as possible.

16:45.713 --> 16:49.591
But they won't make a move
until the con actually goes down.

16:50.509 --> 16:54.263
I'll be in the communications van
monitoring your wires.

16:55.472 --> 17:00.728
Remember, you are looking
for a female Caucasian in her early 20s.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.731
That description fits half
the street population, Ray.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.566
Sorry. It's all we have.

17:06.150 --> 17:09.570
Um, Lieutenant, what if we were
to get up into the room,

17:09.653 --> 17:14.658
uh, and the tootsie turns out to be your
regular eager-to-please type princess?

17:14.742 --> 17:16.035
(chuckling)

17:16.118 --> 17:18.495
-Just try and keep your pants on.
-(men laughing)

17:18.579 --> 17:20.330
And go back onto the street.

17:20.414 --> 17:24.001
-It's a shame to waste the opportunity.
-(laughter)

17:25.961 --> 17:27.254
I didn't plan it that way.

17:29.506 --> 17:30.799
You'll be disciplined, yes?

17:32.259 --> 17:34.803
Schiller could hold me in contempt.
But he won't.

17:36.930 --> 17:37.765
Thank you.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.685
Mike Gladstone from my office
will probably call me in

17:41.769 --> 17:43.395
and be particularly avuncular.

17:43.479 --> 17:44.438
(chuckles)

17:49.610 --> 17:51.028
Frank, I'm going to quit.

17:53.072 --> 17:53.989
You don't mean that.

17:54.073 --> 17:54.948
Yes, I do.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.493
Joyce, you're overworked and exhausted.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.703
Especially with this Pam Gilliam thing.

18:00.954 --> 18:03.332
Take 10 days on a beach
in St. Croix, and--

18:07.044 --> 18:07.878
A beach?

18:09.546 --> 18:12.424
Is that supposed to be some modern-day
cure-all for catastrophe?

18:13.050 --> 18:16.428
I'm exhausted from three years
of treading water in an urban cesspool.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.806
No, it's not supposed to be a cure-all.

18:20.307 --> 18:23.977
All I mean is, you've been through
a particularly difficult ordeal,

18:25.187 --> 18:27.731
and maybe a little basking
in some Caribbean sunshine--

18:27.815 --> 18:29.233
My tan is fine, thanks.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.945
The problem is a supposedly
idealistic career...

18:33.529 --> 18:35.447
where the pay is lousy,
the hours are lousy,

18:35.531 --> 18:38.826
and the atmosphere you could bottle
and sell for lab-quality sewage,

18:38.909 --> 18:42.246
not to mention the wonderful sense
of accomplishment implicit...

18:42.329 --> 18:44.998
in being able to survive seeing
your ideals shattered.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.668
I don't believe I'm hearing this.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.338
All morning, people have been telling me
they want to quit.

18:52.506 --> 18:55.759
Doesn't anybody have the character anymore
to work a job through?

18:55.843 --> 18:58.387
That's not exactly
the 11th Commandment, Frank.

18:59.179 --> 19:01.098
"Thou shalt work a job
until it kills you."

19:01.974 --> 19:05.144
If things aren't working out,
why not start fresh, keep moving?

19:05.561 --> 19:08.856
The option of the rich, the bright,
and the socially acceptable.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.693
And you're the great proletarian hero.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.739
The first one I ever saw,
by the way, who was a cop.

19:18.532 --> 19:21.827
As they say in the relationship game,
thanks for being so supportive.

20:14.504 --> 20:16.089
'82 Cutlass Supreme.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.549
BELKER:<i> Two Latin males.</i>

20:52.793 --> 20:54.962
RENKO: I'm tellin' ya-- Come on, Trace.

20:55.045 --> 20:58.340
What can I possibly do to cheer that man
up, fall down a flight of stairs?

21:00.384 --> 21:03.387
Yes, I'm well aware of that, dear sister.
I am well aware of that.

21:03.470 --> 21:05.514
But what am I supposed to do
to cheer him up?

21:07.057 --> 21:08.850
Tracy, I love Dad just as much as you do,

21:08.934 --> 21:11.019
but sometimes it takes a real effort,
you know?

21:11.603 --> 21:13.605
I mean, he hates me when I don't come to
see him,

21:13.689 --> 21:15.148
and he hates me worse when I do.

21:15.232 --> 21:18.110
-(Tracy indistinct)
-(sniffling)

21:18.193 --> 21:21.071
Okay. Okay, I'll come by tonight.
I can't promise you when.

21:21.989 --> 21:22.823
Bye-bye.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.461
You lookin' for a date?

21:38.213 --> 21:39.047
Yeah.

21:45.512 --> 21:46.680
(coughing)

21:50.183 --> 21:52.227
You know, Joe,
you don't take your clothes off,

21:52.311 --> 21:54.563
a lot of girls are gonna think
you're a cop right away.

21:55.272 --> 21:56.315
You think I'm a cop?

21:57.941 --> 21:59.776
Guess not. You would've busted me already.

22:03.238 --> 22:04.072
Want a cigarette?

22:05.282 --> 22:06.158
No, I quit.

22:11.663 --> 22:13.915
Hey, you look nervous or somethin'.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.501
-It's okay. It happens to a lot of guys.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.754
Look, can I ask you a question?

22:18.837 --> 22:21.256
I don't mean to pry or anything,
but where is your family?

22:23.467 --> 22:25.385
-Wichita.
-Do you see 'em often?

22:25.469 --> 22:27.137
Why would I wanna see 'em?

22:29.222 --> 22:30.974
Because a family's important to people.

22:31.058 --> 22:34.519
Hey, would ya-- Look, I send my mom stuff.

22:36.229 --> 22:39.274
You tell her you're one of them high-paid
fashion models or somethin'?

22:39.691 --> 22:42.235
Hey, look, Joe, you don't wanna make it,
that's fine.

22:42.903 --> 22:46.031
But don't start gettin' your jollies
telling me my life's no good.

22:47.866 --> 22:50.744
This guy you work for, he sort of makes
you feel like family, doesn't he?

22:50.827 --> 22:52.037
-Yeah, he does.
-Fast car.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.747
All kinds of good drugs, pretty clothes.

22:53.830 --> 22:56.458
You don't even know Vic, all right?
He's okay.

22:57.084 --> 23:00.253
You know who he used to go out with?
Linda Farren.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.257
Like, Linda Farren of the Motettes?

23:04.424 --> 23:06.385
He was her personal manager for two years.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.095
Oh. Well, that's just swell.

23:08.178 --> 23:10.680
He's gonna make you the next
Linda Farren, isn't he?

23:10.764 --> 23:12.974
Yeah, he is. I'm just not ready yet.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.062
Now, you listen to me.

23:17.562 --> 23:20.232
I'm not a very good judge or anything,
but I'm a little afraid for you.

23:20.315 --> 23:22.567
No, no, see, I've been around guys
like this Vic before, you know.

23:22.651 --> 23:25.362
-He isn't like that.
-It happens all the time, you know?

23:25.445 --> 23:26.947
It happens all the time.

23:27.030 --> 23:28.198
All of a sudden,
a cookie gets off the bus.

23:28.281 --> 23:30.158
-Let go of me.
-In six months, you're gone.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.119
Six months, you're gone.
You're in a rat slum.

23:32.202 --> 23:33.120
-With two black eyes...
-Stop it!

23:33.203 --> 23:35.330
Shootin' dope under your tongue
so the johns don't hear you're a junkie!

23:35.414 --> 23:38.542
Stop it. Let go of me!
He wouldn't do that!

23:39.167 --> 23:42.379
Vic was Linda Farren's
personal manager for two years.

23:42.462 --> 23:45.465
(coughing)

23:45.841 --> 23:49.386
(coughing continues)

23:53.557 --> 23:56.351
(door opens, closes)

24:00.939 --> 24:02.023
(chattering)

24:21.710 --> 24:25.130
We got 'em.
It's a regular feeding frenzy in here.

24:25.213 --> 24:26.673
Send in the backups.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.603
Hey, what is this, man?

24:41.229 --> 24:42.314
What is it?

24:42.397 --> 24:43.857
MAN: Cops! Cops!

24:43.940 --> 24:45.192
Let's go! Come on!

24:45.275 --> 24:47.277
-(siren wailing)
-MAN: Move! Let's go!

24:54.159 --> 24:55.076
Freeze! Police!

24:56.828 --> 24:57.996
(growls)

25:04.127 --> 25:05.754
Sniff cement, hairball!

25:10.300 --> 25:12.469
Man, these guys
must have been working overtime.

25:13.011 --> 25:14.888
Yeah, you wouldn't believe
all the stuff in here, Neal.

25:14.971 --> 25:18.183
Eighteen brand-new radials,
two crates full of car stereos,

25:18.391 --> 25:20.685
carburetors, turbo kits, specialty parts.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.395
You'd think they were gonna
start their own auto shop.

25:22.479 --> 25:24.481
Wouldn't be surprised
if they already have.

25:25.273 --> 25:27.317
Looks like they were getting
ready to make a delivery

25:27.400 --> 25:28.276
when we busted in here, huh?

25:28.360 --> 25:31.279
Now all we gotta do is find out
who was on the receiving end.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.406
Hmm, there's the tow truck. About time.

25:35.200 --> 25:39.412
Back it up to the Cutlass, would ya?
Come on. Come on.

25:39.496 --> 25:40.914
A little more. Come on. Come on.

25:40.997 --> 25:42.332
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Yeah.

25:44.876 --> 25:47.420
What's the matter, boss?
You never seen a tow truck before?

25:48.255 --> 25:49.923
Hey, what's happening, babe?

25:50.006 --> 25:53.385
(laughing)

25:53.468 --> 25:55.345
Hey, man, when did you start
driving one of these, huh?

25:55.428 --> 25:57.264
About three days ago when they realized...

25:57.347 --> 26:00.308
how bad I was screwing up
the filing system down at Division.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.353
Yeah. I tried calling you
down there all last week.

26:04.187 --> 26:05.981
You know how they are
about leaving messages.

26:06.898 --> 26:07.983
So, what's the deal?

26:08.775 --> 26:11.903
Oh, busted some car strippers.
No big deal.

26:12.279 --> 26:13.238
Who are you kiddin'?

26:14.281 --> 26:16.449
Looks like they ran half of Detroit
through here.

26:16.992 --> 26:17.867
(whistles)

26:18.535 --> 26:20.954
Uh, don't strain yourself,
ya lunch buckets.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.748
-Hi, J.D.
-How ya doin'?

26:27.794 --> 26:29.838
Whatever I got,
they must think it's contagious.

26:31.381 --> 26:33.550
How's it going, babe? Really.

26:35.135 --> 26:38.346
Stinks, man. I'm eatin' dirt.

26:40.849 --> 26:43.184
(sighs) Yeah, I'm back in AA.
I'm seein' a shrink.

26:44.519 --> 26:46.062
I'll do whatever I have to to get back.

26:49.691 --> 26:50.525
Thanks for asking.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.112
Better get my butt in gear.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.700
-The half-eaten Cutlass, right?
-Yeah, right.

26:59.784 --> 27:00.619
Need a hand, J.D.?

27:02.120 --> 27:03.288
Give me a break, would ya?

27:09.127 --> 27:11.338
BELKER: Nobody'd blame you
if you dumped him, you know.

27:13.506 --> 27:14.549
I can't do that, Mick.

27:15.884 --> 27:18.511
Half the stuff I know about undercover,
I learned from J.D.

27:20.055 --> 27:22.932
Up until last year, I felt lucky
just to be teamed up with him.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.225
You don't owe him nothin'.

27:25.977 --> 27:29.439
He's walkin' a straight razor, Neal.
Some guys like it that way, you know?

27:34.277 --> 27:35.236
Oh, my God.

27:36.613 --> 27:37.447
What?

27:38.698 --> 27:39.783
See this?

27:40.450 --> 27:41.660
COFFEY: It's a steering wheel.

27:41.743 --> 27:43.995
Tell that to Esterhaus.
It belongs to his Buick.

27:44.871 --> 27:48.041
This? (laughing)

27:49.209 --> 27:52.671
Sunday drives with Margaret,
and drive-ins with Cindy.

27:53.380 --> 27:58.343
Grace and I cruising, top down,
along the shore.

27:58.677 --> 28:01.429
I spent the best years
of my life behind this wheel.

28:02.013 --> 28:06.309
Oh, God. I'm gonna miss that car.

28:06.393 --> 28:09.270
You shouldn't give up hope.
We may find it yet.

28:09.896 --> 28:11.022
You really think so?

28:11.606 --> 28:14.567
COFFEY: Hey, it's probably in some
warehouse just as good as new.

28:14.651 --> 28:16.069
Oh, I don't know about that, Sarge.

28:17.195 --> 28:18.238
The way these creeps operate,

28:18.321 --> 28:21.241
it's probably being sold for parts
in 28 states by now.

28:22.617 --> 28:24.994
Where is she,
you heartless little butcher?

28:25.662 --> 28:27.414
-Where's my Buick?
-NEAL: Hey, hey, hey!

28:27.497 --> 28:29.249
Take it easy, Sarge.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

28:29.332 --> 28:31.793
We'll try to locate it for you, okay?
Easy.

28:32.001 --> 28:34.129
Uh, if they don't, Sarge,

28:34.212 --> 28:37.298
you think a 10 spot would buy that
for my motor home?

28:38.675 --> 28:40.301
Uh, just a thought.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.598
Captain,
the kid was so anxious to make a deal,

28:45.682 --> 28:47.559
he gave us the name of their big buyer.

28:47.934 --> 28:50.395
-How generous.
-Guy's pretty big.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.398
I've seen his ads in the paper.
Rusco Auto Parts.

28:53.481 --> 28:55.859
-Okay, go down there and pick him up.
-Right, Captain.

28:56.443 --> 29:01.030
Oh, by the way, I ran into LaRue
on tow truck down there.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.074
Oh?

29:03.450 --> 29:06.494
He's straightened up his act, Captain.
I think he really means it this time.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.455
I've heard that one before. So have you.

29:09.247 --> 29:11.416
It feels real different to me
this time, Captain.

29:13.793 --> 29:14.711
That's good to hear.

29:16.171 --> 29:18.047
Well, I guess what I mean to say is, uh,

29:18.339 --> 29:20.633
what do you think the chances are
of his coming back?

29:21.134 --> 29:23.720
I haven't any idea, Neal.
It's in the hands of the Board of Rights.

29:23.803 --> 29:24.929
But I wouldn't bet on it.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.016
Got a minute, Frank?

29:28.183 --> 29:31.186
I just dropped by to pat
a few newly promoted fannies.

29:33.146 --> 29:34.522
Sure, Chief. Come on in.

29:35.231 --> 29:38.109
Chief. Captain, excuse me.

29:39.903 --> 29:40.737
Frank,

29:42.280 --> 29:44.407
let's have a frank discussion
about the women in your life.

29:44.491 --> 29:47.076
Oh, now, wait a minute, Chief.
I'm sorry about that sit-in,

29:47.160 --> 29:49.412
and I certainly don't condone
Fay's participation.

29:50.413 --> 29:51.581
First, your wife.

29:51.998 --> 29:53.958
-Ex-wife.
-Ex-wife.

29:54.042 --> 29:54.876
Excuse me.

29:56.002 --> 30:00.799
Falls under the sway of a politically
ambitious female of suspicious gender.

30:02.008 --> 30:04.511
Then, if that's not bad enough,
I just had lunch with Mo Schiller,

30:04.594 --> 30:07.180
who tells me Joyce Davenport's
up a tree about something.

30:07.972 --> 30:10.391
You're surrounded
by distempered tuna, Frank.

30:10.475 --> 30:14.479
What would you have me do, Chief?
I don't control either one of them.

30:14.562 --> 30:16.272
That's the understatement of the year.

30:17.440 --> 30:20.693
Frank, I remember back in '69,

30:21.319 --> 30:23.363
just when I was getting ready
to make my big push,

30:23.446 --> 30:27.408
my own Cora got into a thing
about these antiwar veterans.

30:27.492 --> 30:29.994
Wanted to go marching with them,
the whole damn business.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.580
So I got her tickets to Hello, Dolly!,

30:32.956 --> 30:36.125
bought her a dozen roses,
new drapes for the living room,

30:36.584 --> 30:37.669
and in no time at all...

30:37.752 --> 30:40.463
she was right back to being
the regular little woman.

30:41.965 --> 30:44.634
Frank, I don't know how
you're gonna do it,

30:44.717 --> 30:47.804
but you've got to find a way
to muzzle her now.

30:48.805 --> 30:50.682
You know how these menopausal matrons get.

30:51.432 --> 30:54.644
You let them think they're responsible
for a few Negroes getting promoted,

30:54.727 --> 30:58.314
and next they'll want the P.R.'s
and the homos--

30:58.398 --> 31:00.900
Excuse me, mister.

31:00.984 --> 31:02.443
Fay. (chuckles)

31:02.527 --> 31:04.153
Well, how nice to see you again.

31:04.904 --> 31:07.949
I just stopped by to congratulate
some of our new promotions.

31:08.408 --> 31:10.285
We have a Black lieutenant
at Hill Street, Fay.

31:10.368 --> 31:13.204
Oh? And what about the P.R.'s
and the homos?

31:13.288 --> 31:14.372
(chuckles)

31:14.455 --> 31:16.374
Well, just man talk.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.043
Ah. Frank. Fay.

31:19.502 --> 31:21.296
-Alf!
-(sighs)

31:21.379 --> 31:22.881
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

31:23.298 --> 31:25.174
If only I'd had a tape recorder.

31:25.592 --> 31:28.428
Well, man talk or no man talk,

31:29.429 --> 31:32.473
the fact is, there've been eight
Black promotions department-wide,

31:32.557 --> 31:34.475
so maybe your group
has had an influence, after all.

31:35.518 --> 31:37.604
Oh, well, they're not my group
anymore, Frank.

31:39.188 --> 31:40.023
Frank...

31:44.068 --> 31:45.695
during the time we were married,

31:46.613 --> 31:48.698
was there ever anything about me,
you know,

31:48.781 --> 31:54.162
either, um, emotionally
or, uh, anatomically...

31:54.245 --> 31:58.249
that, um, would lead you to believe
that I was masculine?

31:58.583 --> 31:59.542
Masculine?

32:00.627 --> 32:01.628
Your anatomy?

32:02.503 --> 32:04.464
Well, it-- what I mean is--

32:05.715 --> 32:09.928
I mean, did you ever think I might be gay?

32:10.261 --> 32:11.679
(laughs) You?

32:12.764 --> 32:14.307
Midge Dolson made a pass at me.

32:15.058 --> 32:16.184
FURILLO: Oh, dear.

32:17.060 --> 32:19.354
You see, I-I went over to her loft...

32:19.646 --> 32:22.023
to tell her I was sorry about not being
arrested with the group, you know?

32:22.106 --> 32:24.943
And, well, she was so nice, you know?

32:25.026 --> 32:29.530
We had tea, and we sat around
and talked ideas.

32:29.614 --> 32:33.701
I thought to myself, oh, how wonderful.
At last, a real friend.

32:35.745 --> 32:39.165
And then she, uh, asked me
if she could give me a back rub.

32:39.248 --> 32:40.124
Oh.

32:40.208 --> 32:41.626
I told her I wasn't interested.

32:42.919 --> 32:46.339
But, uh, she pointed out that there's a--

32:46.923 --> 32:50.134
a certain transience
in my relationships with men.

32:51.678 --> 32:55.556
Fay, Hal Massey died.

32:55.848 --> 32:58.643
That's hardly a transience
you can be held responsible for.

32:59.018 --> 33:02.897
Midge says that I'm suppressing
my true Amazonian sexuality.

33:02.981 --> 33:07.402
Oh, Midge Dolson
can go suppress her... face.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.701
I just wanted her for a friend, you know?

33:16.119 --> 33:17.412
I really want a friend.

33:18.162 --> 33:19.914
There'll be somebody for you, Fay.

33:21.666 --> 33:22.917
I know there will be.

33:24.335 --> 33:25.837
Sometimes, I wonder.

33:27.672 --> 33:30.675
Well, anyhow, listen, I quit WAD.

33:31.259 --> 33:35.513
So you can tell Chief Daniels that
you have the little woman under control.

33:51.988 --> 33:54.991
What is it, my breath?
I can't even get arrested out here.

33:55.283 --> 33:56.242
(chuckles)

34:01.039 --> 34:02.582
Got your key to happiness, hon.

34:03.332 --> 34:05.877
-Got the Herbert Hoover suite.
-Sweet, baby.

34:14.385 --> 34:16.971
I guess business must be
pretty lousy, huh, sweetheart?

34:17.055 --> 34:19.182
Looks to me like you're really
scraping the bottom.

34:19.474 --> 34:22.810
-Go suck your face, you smelly creep!
-It's okay, baby. It's okay.

34:23.019 --> 34:26.272
Hey, you know the only thing I hate worse
than seeing a white girl with a nigger?

34:28.149 --> 34:32.070
The only thing I hate worse...
is being stuck on an elevator with 'em.

34:32.153 --> 34:33.780
Better mind your own business, pal.

34:33.863 --> 34:37.158
-Why don't you just try to make me, boy!
-(glass shatters)

34:37.742 --> 34:40.328
HILL: You make one more move,
I'm gonna bust your face!

34:40.411 --> 34:41.954
-You got that? You got that?
-All right! Yeah!

34:42.038 --> 34:43.331
HILL: Until you post bail,

34:43.748 --> 34:45.958
I think you'd better
refer to me as "Officer," pal.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.460
You lousy sneak!

34:49.587 --> 34:50.421
Come on, lady!

34:53.091 --> 34:53.925
-Right here.
-Okay!

34:54.008 --> 34:57.095
You guys'll make the mistake of your life
if you mess with Pete Rusco.

34:57.178 --> 34:59.722
-I'm an established businessman.
-Sure, sure.

34:59.806 --> 35:03.059
You're a regular pillar of the community.
I'll grab the captain, Neal.

35:03.142 --> 35:04.560
Okay. Right in there.

35:06.729 --> 35:08.064
I don't believe you guys.

35:09.023 --> 35:13.236
Some punk lookin' at hard time tries
to squeal on me, and you guys are buying.

35:13.611 --> 35:15.571
Things must be pretty desperate
around here.

35:16.280 --> 35:20.535
You have a first-rate gang
of well-organized car thieves, Mr. Rusco.

35:21.369 --> 35:23.329
You don't run an operation like that
on spec.

35:23.663 --> 35:25.623
You saying I'm runnin' a car theft ring?

35:25.915 --> 35:27.250
Rather appears that way, doesn't it?

35:28.751 --> 35:31.796
At the very least,
you support their activities...

35:31.879 --> 35:34.674
by being a substantial outlet
for stolen parts.

35:34.757 --> 35:37.385
You damn well better be prepared
to back up those charges,

35:37.677 --> 35:41.222
or I'm gonna slap you
with false arrest, harassment...

35:41.305 --> 35:43.349
and anything else my lawyer
can come up with.

35:43.766 --> 35:44.767
Oh, I beg your pardon.

35:45.643 --> 35:48.062
Then you have factory invoices
for all the parts you sell?

35:48.146 --> 35:49.397
Come on, Captain.

35:50.356 --> 35:52.650
Have you any idea of
the scope of my business?

35:53.693 --> 35:56.571
I've got six retail outlets
in this county alone.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.991
I buy from over 30 distributors
across the state.

36:00.783 --> 36:03.494
How am I supposed to know where
every lousy piece comes from?

36:04.287 --> 36:05.204
Who are you kidding?

36:06.414 --> 36:09.167
Some hype sells you a $200 carburetor
for 20 bucks,

36:09.250 --> 36:11.294
where the hell else is it
supposed to be coming from?

36:11.377 --> 36:13.838
You're a cute piece of business,
Mr. Rusco.

36:15.131 --> 36:18.301
The police protect your home,
your family, your business.

36:18.384 --> 36:20.261
Somebody throws a piece of paper
on your lawn,

36:20.344 --> 36:22.430
you holler right away for the cops,
don't ya?

36:22.513 --> 36:25.308
The aggrieved taxpayer,
solid citizen, right,

36:25.641 --> 36:28.311
doing a land-office business
in stolen goods.

36:28.394 --> 36:33.649
It's that punk's word against mine.
My lawyer'll rip your case to shreds.

36:33.733 --> 36:36.485
For the price he'll be charging you,
I'm sure he'll give it his best shot.

36:36.569 --> 36:38.196
And who knows? Maybe you'll get off.

36:38.529 --> 36:41.532
Receiving stolen property
is a difficult charge to press sometimes,

36:41.616 --> 36:42.825
as you probably know.

36:43.075 --> 36:45.036
But before you get too comfortable,
mister,

36:45.119 --> 36:48.372
let me tell you what I personally
am going to put you through.

36:48.456 --> 36:51.459
Your business is gonna be padlocked
for at least a week...

36:51.542 --> 36:54.670
while we do a thorough and complete
inventory of your entire stock.

36:54.754 --> 36:56.672
Like hell! I know my rights.

36:56.756 --> 36:58.633
What we'll be wanting to see,
among other things,

36:58.716 --> 37:01.010
is if your stock matches up
with your records.

37:01.093 --> 37:05.890
And if it doesn't, if all your "I"s aren't
dotted and all your "T"s aren't crossed,

37:06.182 --> 37:08.434
we're gonna turn the entire matter over
to the IRS.

37:08.517 --> 37:10.102
They eat guys like you for lunch.

37:10.186 --> 37:11.187
Wait a second!

37:11.896 --> 37:14.774
We're talking major-league
police harassment here!

37:15.483 --> 37:16.984
You bet it is, mister.

37:17.944 --> 37:20.738
Neal, throw him in the holding
until his lawyer gets here.

37:21.447 --> 37:22.657
NEAL: Right, Captain.

37:32.500 --> 37:33.334
Hi.

37:36.212 --> 37:37.046
Hi.

37:38.172 --> 37:39.006
Wanna party?

37:40.716 --> 37:42.176
GOLDBLUME (over radio):<i> Depends. How much?</i>

37:42.593 --> 37:46.180
Thirty, and 10 for the room... in advance.

37:46.889 --> 37:48.099
Unless you want something special,

37:48.182 --> 37:50.768
-in which--
-I don't want special. Just the way it is.

37:52.019 --> 37:54.772
There's a hotel down the street.
The Bradford Court.

37:56.023 --> 37:56.899
Let's do it.

38:18.379 --> 38:20.798
-Well, here we are.
-Here we are.

38:23.342 --> 38:26.137
-(sniffs) What's your name?
-Sally.

38:27.471 --> 38:28.389
Sally. That's nice.

38:31.225 --> 38:33.519
Look, I'd like to get business
out of the way first.

38:35.855 --> 38:36.689
Right.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.323
Wanna tell me yours?

38:47.658 --> 38:48.492
Henry.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.203
Well, Henry,

38:52.913 --> 38:54.957
you and I are gonna have
a terrific time here.

39:01.714 --> 39:02.548
I can do that.

39:03.466 --> 39:04.675
You're married, aren't you?

39:09.388 --> 39:10.222
You can tell, huh?

39:11.182 --> 39:13.768
(chuckles lightly) Most of my clients are.

39:16.562 --> 39:17.480
You're tense.

39:17.813 --> 39:20.024
Don't be.
I'm gonna take good care of you, Henry.

39:20.107 --> 39:22.943
-(door slamming open)
-Police! Freeze it right there!

39:23.027 --> 39:23.861
You're under arrest, pal.

39:24.862 --> 39:26.614
Look, I can explain.

39:26.947 --> 39:29.241
-Save it.
-Hey, get your clothes on, toots.

39:29.325 --> 39:30.618
We're going for a ride.

39:30.701 --> 39:34.038
GOLDBLUME (over radio):<i> Look, officers,</i>
<i>nothing happened. I swear it.</i>

39:35.456 --> 39:37.541
My wife finds out, she's gonna kill me.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.252
Maybe you should've
thought of that sooner, hot stuff.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.171
Cuff him and read him his rights, Bill.

39:42.630 --> 39:43.464
Please.

39:45.091 --> 39:45.925
Can't ya--

39:46.842 --> 39:47.718
Give me a break!

39:49.595 --> 39:51.055
I-I got kids, a family.

39:51.680 --> 39:54.642
Get a grip on yourself, pal.
You know, it's not the end of the world.

39:54.725 --> 39:56.769
But you-- you don't understand.
My wife, she'll sue for divorce.

39:56.852 --> 39:57.853
This'll ruin me.

39:58.145 --> 39:58.979
What do you think?

40:00.106 --> 40:00.940
Forget it, O'Connor.

40:01.023 --> 40:03.234
Just throw the damn cuffs on him
and let's get outta here.

40:03.317 --> 40:05.778
Please, this is my first offense.

40:09.907 --> 40:11.909
I'll do anything. I'm begging you.

40:13.411 --> 40:16.247
Hey, if you could only forget it
just this once.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.169
(sighs)

40:23.796 --> 40:27.133
-Well, we can't do that.
-Yeah, but what we can do--

40:27.341 --> 40:29.343
And that's if our commanding officer
says it's okay--

40:29.427 --> 40:31.429
is let you prepay your bond.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.889
You'll never have to see
the inside of a courtroom.

40:33.973 --> 40:35.141
That's it. Let's move!

40:39.603 --> 40:40.479
You can do that?

40:41.480 --> 40:42.565
It's been done on occasion.

40:43.816 --> 40:44.859
How much is the bond?

40:45.526 --> 40:48.112
In a case of this type, 500 cash.

40:49.196 --> 40:52.366
Oh, hey, if you don't have it on you,
we'll give you a lift down to your bank.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.367
Five hundred?

40:55.119 --> 40:56.912
Let me see how much of it I got on me.

40:57.872 --> 41:01.083
(chuckles) I put my cash inside my sock.

41:01.167 --> 41:03.461
Neighborhood like this,
can't be too careful.

41:04.753 --> 41:08.090
All right, folks, the party's over.
You are under arrest.

41:14.805 --> 41:16.932
Drop the gun right now! Drop it!

41:35.367 --> 41:36.202
Hi.

41:37.661 --> 41:38.496
Hi.

41:40.080 --> 41:40.915
How do you feel?

41:42.124 --> 41:44.293
Strong. Very strong.

41:55.262 --> 41:58.390
The doctor said the bullet passed
less than an inch from your heart.

41:58.849 --> 42:00.809
He said you were lucky
to be here right now.

42:02.978 --> 42:04.855
Gee, I'm a regular rabbit's foot.

42:10.819 --> 42:11.737
(sighs)

42:12.655 --> 42:14.615
Hey, come on. Don't. Please.

42:18.327 --> 42:21.247
(sniffling) You promised me
you weren't gonna be that kind of cop.

42:22.206 --> 42:23.040
I know.

42:23.415 --> 42:27.169
You have responsibilities--
to me, to your child.

42:31.131 --> 42:32.675
I know. I'm sorry.

42:33.759 --> 42:36.303
Oh, for God's sake, Henry,
what were you trying to prove?

42:38.764 --> 42:39.598
Nothing.

42:39.682 --> 42:40.516
(knocking)

42:42.893 --> 42:43.727
Rachel?

42:44.687 --> 42:48.482
WOMAN (on P.A.):
<i>Dr. Andrews, E.R., stat. Dr. Andrews.</i>

42:50.317 --> 42:52.486
I know how Henry's doing.
How are you holding up?

42:54.196 --> 42:55.197
I'll be fine, Frank.

42:56.865 --> 42:59.785
Let me just go out for a while
and freshen up,

42:59.868 --> 43:01.370
and you two can talk in private.

43:01.453 --> 43:02.288
Sure.

43:02.746 --> 43:06.792
WOMAN (on P.A.):
<i>Dr. Pruitt, 1408. Dr. Pruitt.</i>

43:12.548 --> 43:14.300
You know, it's really something, Frank.

43:16.552 --> 43:18.262
I'm lying here lucky to be alive.

43:19.430 --> 43:23.475
My own wife, first words out of her mouth,
she's busting my chops.

43:25.019 --> 43:25.936
Makes you wonder.

43:26.687 --> 43:28.731
They live with this fear
all the time, Henry.

43:29.732 --> 43:32.776
It takes a certain kind of woman
to put up with the life, most can't.

43:36.822 --> 43:38.157
You did good work out there.

43:41.035 --> 43:43.954
Cut it out, Frank.
I screwed up, and you know it.

43:45.956 --> 43:47.916
We'll have a lot of time to talk about it.

43:49.752 --> 43:51.545
You get well. I need you back on the job.

44:06.101 --> 44:07.102
FURILLO: Hello, Joyce.

44:08.395 --> 44:10.481
I heard about Henry. How is he?

44:10.981 --> 44:12.983
Oh, he'll be fine. He was lucky.

44:15.361 --> 44:17.571
I think we have a few things
to talk over, Frank.

44:17.738 --> 44:20.616
Uh-huh. I was about to phone you.

44:36.465 --> 44:38.967
I was way out of line this afternoon.
I'm sorry.

44:40.427 --> 44:43.430
I realize now I was much less concerned
with your welfare

44:43.514 --> 44:44.723
than I was with my own.

44:46.767 --> 44:48.143
I was afraid of losing you.

44:49.770 --> 44:50.979
You should know better than that.

44:52.898 --> 44:56.860
Well, so much of what we have in common
is the work.

44:57.194 --> 44:59.363
Is that the only thing
you think that binds us?

45:00.155 --> 45:01.532
It's a big part of it, I think.

45:02.157 --> 45:05.244
Face it, we don't exactly run
in the same social circles.

45:06.286 --> 45:07.287
I was afraid if...

45:09.206 --> 45:12.584
you left my world, I wouldn't be able
to hold onto you in yours.

45:13.502 --> 45:17.715
Frank, if our relationship can't tolerate
a change of careers...

45:17.798 --> 45:20.092
for either of us,
then maybe we ought to know that.

45:21.135 --> 45:23.512
There are some things
I'm not sure I need to know.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.098
How about the fact that I love you?

45:27.850 --> 45:29.476
I'm afraid that's not always enough.

45:30.561 --> 45:31.937
It's not bad for a start.

45:34.940 --> 45:35.774
Did you quit?

45:39.403 --> 45:40.821
I took a two-week leave...

45:41.739 --> 45:44.324
to assess my situation, review my options.

45:45.701 --> 45:47.119
Maybe go lie in the sun.

45:48.454 --> 45:49.288
You free for dinner...

45:51.039 --> 45:52.291
to discuss your options?

45:53.917 --> 45:56.044
I was planning on early retirement.

45:58.088 --> 45:58.922
Alone?

46:00.716 --> 46:02.176
I had hoped otherwise.

46:16.523 --> 46:18.692
Well, I know we got serious problems
as a family,

46:18.776 --> 46:20.652
but it's not too late to get things right.

46:21.028 --> 46:22.905
I know it's not gonna be easy,
but when you come right down to it,

46:22.988 --> 46:24.531
all you've got is your loved ones.

46:24.740 --> 46:26.366
-Yeah, you're right about that, cowboy.
-I tell you what.

46:26.450 --> 46:27.826
I'll meet you down here in Henry's room

46:27.910 --> 46:29.495
-after I go up and get to...
-HILL: All right. Yeah.

46:31.538 --> 46:33.791
Hey, Pop, how's it going?
You feeling all right?

46:34.875 --> 46:37.461
If I was feeling all right,
I wouldn't be here.

46:38.420 --> 46:40.339
Well, you're still coming home Friday,
aren't you?

46:41.340 --> 46:42.966
We're gonna keep him here
with us a while longer, Mr. Renko.

46:43.550 --> 46:44.760
Why? What's going on?

46:45.427 --> 46:47.304
There are a few things I've been trying
to discuss with your father

46:47.387 --> 46:48.764
that I think you should know about.

46:54.770 --> 46:56.980
Say, Renko, I was waiting
for you up in Goldblume's room.

46:57.064 --> 46:58.315
What are you doing down here?

47:01.777 --> 47:03.737
What's wrong? Didn't you see your old man?

47:05.572 --> 47:07.950
-Let's just get out of here.
-Wait a minute, Renko.

47:08.408 --> 47:12.079
You gotta talk to me, man.
What-- What happened up there?

47:14.957 --> 47:17.960
-Nothin'.
-(engine starts)

47:26.385 --> 47:28.011
(engine turns off)

47:34.309 --> 47:36.061
He's got cancer, Bobby.

47:37.521 --> 47:38.814
It's all through his body.

47:40.983 --> 47:43.652
Oh, no, man. I'm--I'm sorry, Renko.

47:45.070 --> 47:46.530
That's my daddy up there,

47:47.906 --> 47:49.324
and he's dying on me.

47:51.243 --> 47:53.871
And he won't even let me sit
in the same room with him.

47:58.500 --> 47:59.626
(sobbing)

48:16.727 --> 48:19.730
(closing theme playing)
