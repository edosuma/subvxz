01:32.158 --> 01:34.761
Yes, Captain, I'm arriving now.

01:34.828 --> 01:37.664
I'm fully aware of
how sensitive it...

01:37.730 --> 01:39.666
Right.

01:39.732 --> 01:41.234
Okay. As soon
as I know anything.

01:41.301 --> 01:42.769
(quiet chatter)

01:42.836 --> 01:44.671
Fun morning?

01:44.737 --> 01:46.673
PACOM reminding me this
is a delicate situation

01:46.739 --> 01:48.775
that requires a thoughtful
resolution.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.710
Fourth call this morning, and
I'm barely at the crime scene.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.813
Oh, I guess we won't
phone it in, then.

01:54.848 --> 01:57.750
So, who's our victim?

01:54.848 --> 01:57.750
Victim is Shogo Oda.

01:57.817 --> 01:59.252
He's an Isso

01:59.319 --> 02:00.320
with the Japan Maritime
Self-Defense Force.

02:00.386 --> 02:03.356
Isso? Petty Officer?

02:03.423 --> 02:04.891
Oh, you know
your Japanese ranks.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.660
Worked a couple cases out
of the Yokosuka Field Office.

02:07.727 --> 02:10.230
COD appears to be
multiple stab wounds.

02:10.296 --> 02:12.332
Wallet and phone's missing.

02:12.398 --> 02:14.367
It's pretty vicious
for a mugging, though.

02:14.434 --> 02:16.236
HPD find any similar MOs?

02:16.302 --> 02:17.637
No. Nothing like this.

02:17.704 --> 02:19.572
Whoever did it got up
close and personal.

02:19.639 --> 02:20.840
Has he had any problems
since he's been here?

02:20.907 --> 02:23.409
Not sure. Kai's inside
talking to his buddies.

02:23.476 --> 02:24.711
They're all in town this week

02:24.777 --> 02:26.913
for some field training
exercise.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.815
Operation Iron Cloud.

02:28.882 --> 02:32.218
Computer-based drills focused
on ballistic missile defense.

02:32.285 --> 02:34.254
Think this could be connected?

02:34.320 --> 02:35.622
We need to find out.

02:35.688 --> 02:36.823
Give Commander Chase
a heads-up.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.825
Tell her the body's
on the way.

02:38.892 --> 02:41.594
Yeah, I'll make sure the autopsy
moves to the top of her list.

02:44.797 --> 02:47.300
(dance music playing
over headphones)

02:44.797 --> 02:47.300
(door lock beeps)

02:49.869 --> 02:51.337
(clears throat)

02:52.639 --> 02:53.907
(clears throat)

02:54.707 --> 02:56.910
Quick:
Favorite go-to karaoke song?

02:56.976 --> 02:58.711
Ah, none.

02:58.778 --> 03:00.580
I don't believe in karaoke.

03:00.647 --> 03:02.448
It isn't something
to believe in or not.

03:02.515 --> 03:04.350
It-it just exists,
like science.

03:04.417 --> 03:06.719
I skipped my sister's
bachelorette party

03:06.786 --> 03:08.788
because they went
to a karaoke club.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.857
Wow. Nerves?

03:10.924 --> 03:11.824
Principle.

03:11.891 --> 03:13.826
I don't like singing.
I'm not good at it.

03:13.893 --> 03:16.596
And I-I refuse to be
peer-pressured.

03:16.663 --> 03:18.731
Well, i-it's not about
being good or not.

03:18.798 --> 03:21.801
It's about having fun
and-and letting go, you know?

03:21.868 --> 03:22.769
(hums)

03:22.835 --> 03:24.237
Yeah,
one man's letting go is

03:24.304 --> 03:26.973
another woman's
embarrassing public spectacle.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.543
Were you able to find
any information on our victim?

03:30.610 --> 03:32.545
Yeah, well, I'm working on it.

03:32.612 --> 03:34.347
His, uh, cell phone

03:34.414 --> 03:35.848
and personnel records
were stored in Japan,

03:35.915 --> 03:38.484
so my normal databases
aren't any use.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.587
Which also eliminates
social media.

03:40.653 --> 03:41.888
Uh, not entirely.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.690
I can't access Shogo's accounts

03:43.756 --> 03:45.892
without permission from
the Japanese companies, but...

03:45.959 --> 03:48.695
I ran a geotag search
on the karaoke bar,

03:48.761 --> 03:51.264
and I got a lot of hits.

03:51.331 --> 03:52.265
All the photos

03:52.332 --> 03:53.733
his friends posted.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.902
Yeah, and Shogo's
in several of them.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.902
See?

03:55.969 --> 03:57.904
He never sang, either.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.806
Yeah, and look what happened
to him.

03:59.872 --> 04:01.941
Sorry.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.811
He seems distracted
by his phone.

04:04.877 --> 04:06.412
Maybe he was texting
with someone?

04:06.479 --> 04:07.847
Yeah, looks like it.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.882
There was no phone
with his body.

04:09.949 --> 04:12.919
Could you get access
to those text messages?

04:12.986 --> 04:16.656
Not until we get some
cooperation from the Japanese.

04:22.895 --> 04:24.931
(quiet chatter)

04:25.898 --> 04:27.567
We've got company.

04:29.569 --> 04:31.037
JESSE:
That the Japanese commander?

04:31.104 --> 04:33.973
And everyone determined
to keep him happy.

04:35.942 --> 04:38.378
Captain Milius.

04:35.942 --> 04:38.378
Allow me to introduce

04:38.444 --> 04:41.381
Special Agent in
Charge Jane Tennant.

04:41.447 --> 04:43.483
She'll be handling
the investigation.

04:43.549 --> 04:44.651
Nisa Tanaka,

04:44.717 --> 04:46.552
allow me to express

04:46.619 --> 04:49.055
my deepest condolences
for your loss.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.456
Thank you.

04:50.523 --> 04:52.392
This has been devastating
for us.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.960
Isso Oda was much respected.

04:54.027 --> 04:56.462
We're doing everything we can
to find out who did this.

04:57.497 --> 04:58.865
But we could use your help.

04:57.497 --> 04:58.865
Of course.

04:58.931 --> 05:00.833
Whatever you require.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.669
The first thing is that
we need to speak to the men

05:02.735 --> 05:03.836
who were there last night.

05:03.903 --> 05:06.039
We'll make them available
immediately.

05:06.105 --> 05:08.675
(speaking Japanese)

05:08.741 --> 05:11.844
I need a word. It's important.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.647
Can you settle everyone
in the conference room?

05:14.714 --> 05:16.816
I'll be right in.

05:14.714 --> 05:16.816
Gentlemen.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.923
I cannot stress enough
how delicate this is.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.726
So I've been told.
A lot.

05:26.793 --> 05:28.895
Secretary of the Navy
called me himself.

05:28.961 --> 05:31.064
Wants me to stay on top
of the situation.

05:31.130 --> 05:32.899
Solving homicides is suddenly
under your purview?

05:32.965 --> 05:36.636
I'm just here to help
however I can.

05:36.703 --> 05:37.770
The thing is...

05:39.005 --> 05:41.774
...this isn't the first murder
associated with Iron Cloud.

05:41.841 --> 05:45.611
Operation Iron Cloud
changes locations each year.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.914
Last year,
exercises were set in Okinawa.

05:47.980 --> 05:50.049
Someone was killed?

05:50.116 --> 05:51.851
A Japanese woman
named Yuki Sawa.

05:51.918 --> 05:53.920
She was a translator
at the JMSDF.

05:53.986 --> 05:56.389
You think the two cases
are connected?

05:56.456 --> 05:57.957
(scoffs) I know they are.

05:58.024 --> 06:01.961
The sailor killed last night
was Yuki Sawa's boyfriend.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.130
And Yuki was murdered
in the exact same manner--

06:04.197 --> 06:05.965
stabbed in the heart.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.534
Did the Okinawa investigation
come up with any suspects?

06:08.601 --> 06:10.036
Only one:
Abby Nelson,

06:10.103 --> 06:12.505
an American working
for a Navy contractor

06:12.572 --> 06:14.040
called Translation Nexus.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.509
Nelson was living in Okinawa
with Yuki at the time,

06:16.576 --> 06:19.078
but guess where
she's living now.

06:20.079 --> 06:22.081
KAI:
Honolulu.

06:22.148 --> 06:23.516
She's been there
since she left Japan.

06:23.583 --> 06:24.817
If Nelson was
such a good suspect,

06:24.884 --> 06:25.985
why isn't she behind bars?

06:26.052 --> 06:28.087
Didn't have enough evidence
to convict.

06:28.154 --> 06:29.822
Did they have motive?

06:29.889 --> 06:31.390
Stabbing someone like that
is intense.

06:31.457 --> 06:32.859
I wouldn't call it intense.

06:32.925 --> 06:34.594
I'd call it efficient.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.129
With a sharp blade
and enough velocity,

06:36.195 --> 06:38.965
you don't need much force
to pierce clothes,

06:39.031 --> 06:40.733
skin and organ tissue.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.536
Massive internal damage
with a minimum of fuss.

06:44.137 --> 06:48.040
Mr. Oda's COD was traumatic
injury to the thoracic aorta.

06:48.107 --> 06:52.812
Strikes were deep and swift,
no evidence of hesitation.

06:52.879 --> 06:54.847
I'm not seeing
any defensive wounds.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.449
No. I don't think
he ever saw it coming.

06:56.516 --> 07:00.453
Means the killer got close
without arousing suspicion.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.822
Could a woman do this?

07:03.623 --> 07:05.124
I think a woman
could do anything.

07:06.125 --> 07:08.461
Right. Me, too.

07:08.528 --> 07:11.030
This is a gender-neutral
killing.

07:11.097 --> 07:14.467
Trace indicates the weapon:
Damascus stainless steel.

07:14.534 --> 07:15.802
Too common to be much help.

07:15.868 --> 07:17.570
Foreign DNA?

07:15.868 --> 07:17.570
No, Special Agent.

07:17.637 --> 07:18.838
No foreign DNA
or fingerprints.

07:18.905 --> 07:21.874
No confession secreted
in the body.

07:21.941 --> 07:24.744
His aura is green,

07:24.811 --> 07:26.512
but I don't put that
in the report.

07:26.579 --> 07:28.681
Only other detail...

07:28.748 --> 07:33.186
your victim's last meal was
Japanese noodles.

07:33.252 --> 07:35.087
What kind?

07:33.252 --> 07:35.087
Hoto.

07:35.154 --> 07:36.956
Does it matter?

07:37.023 --> 07:39.125
Depends how much
you value precision.

07:39.192 --> 07:42.061
In forensic medicine,
we value it above all else.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.596
In Japanese cooking,

07:43.663 --> 07:46.165
a chef often holds
his or her noodle recipe

07:46.232 --> 07:48.167
to the same standard.

07:48.234 --> 07:50.236
Yeah. The broth can be
incredibly specific,

07:50.303 --> 07:53.573
not just to the region but
to the individual restaurant.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.675
So, we-we figure out
where he ate,

07:55.741 --> 07:57.476
we can track his movements.

07:57.543 --> 07:59.078
Bon appétit.

08:01.781 --> 08:03.182
As part of the training
exercise in Japan,

08:03.249 --> 08:06.118
Yuki invited Nelson to stay
with her for a few weeks.

08:06.185 --> 08:07.653
ERNIE:
Best way to improve
language skills is

08:07.720 --> 08:09.222
to immerse yourself
in the culture.

08:09.288 --> 08:12.158
Probably works better if you
don't stab your host to death.

08:15.261 --> 08:17.029
Sorry. Don't mind me.

08:17.096 --> 08:18.831
He's helping.

08:19.765 --> 08:22.101
Why did the investigation

08:19.765 --> 08:22.101
focus on Nelson?

08:22.168 --> 08:24.170
She was in the apartment
when Yuki was killed.

08:24.237 --> 08:26.072
Said she was asleep
and didn't hear anything

08:26.138 --> 08:28.174
until she found the body
in the morning.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.508
JESSE:
She didn't call the police

08:29.575 --> 08:30.576
until almost an hour later.

08:30.643 --> 08:31.878
Why the delay?

08:31.944 --> 08:33.646
Cops figure she was
getting rid of evidence.

08:33.713 --> 08:35.681
Nelson insisted
she was just in shock.

08:36.315 --> 08:37.950
I heard her story kept changing.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.152
Yeah. Local investigators
were convinced she did it.

08:40.219 --> 08:43.756
They were trying to gather
enough evidence to charge her.

08:43.823 --> 08:46.726
Yeah, well, lots of outrage and
finger-pointing by the locals.

08:46.792 --> 08:50.196
Got even worse for a few weeks
after Nelson fled the country.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.164
Yeah.
We heard American authorities

08:52.231 --> 08:53.866
just put her on a plane
in the middle of the night.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.134
You know who gave that order?

08:55.201 --> 08:57.236
That seems to be
something of a mystery.

08:57.303 --> 08:59.071
TENNANT:
We should find out.

08:59.138 --> 09:00.573
Maybe you could look into that?

09:00.640 --> 09:02.208
I'm on it.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.176
We need to talk to Abby Nelson.

09:10.983 --> 09:12.551
We know her location?

09:12.618 --> 09:15.221
HPD checked her work and
her apartment. No sign of her.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.989
Think she's running?

09:18.291 --> 09:19.959
I got 20 bucks says "no."

09:21.127 --> 09:22.728
Any takers?

09:24.630 --> 09:27.033
Looking for me?

09:34.106 --> 09:35.875
ABBY:
I can't believe this
is happening again.

09:35.942 --> 09:38.110
You don't seem that shocked.

09:38.177 --> 09:41.113
Isn't an abnormal reaction
the definition of shock?

09:41.180 --> 09:43.849
Are you sure you wouldn't prefer
to have an attorney present?

09:43.916 --> 09:46.686
I have nothing to hide.
I didn't kill anyone.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.254
Not here and not in Okinawa.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.690
Duffel bag you were carrying
looked like you packed

09:50.756 --> 09:52.224
for a long trip.

09:52.291 --> 09:54.160
And yet I came
directly to you.

09:54.226 --> 09:56.228
I'll admit my first instinct
was to take off.

09:56.295 --> 09:59.966
But then I realized,
I haven't done anything wrong.

10:00.032 --> 10:00.967
So you wouldn't mind telling us

10:01.033 --> 10:02.835
where you were last night,

10:02.902 --> 10:04.203
around midnight?

10:04.270 --> 10:05.972
In my apartment, sleeping.

10:06.038 --> 10:08.307
Same alibi you gave
when Yuki Sawa was murdered.

10:08.374 --> 10:09.875
Sleeping?

10:09.942 --> 10:12.211
Yes. I do it every night.

10:13.045 --> 10:15.815
Look, this has been

10:13.045 --> 10:15.815
hard on me.

10:15.881 --> 10:18.250
I had a great job.
I got to travel all over.

10:18.317 --> 10:19.986
But after what happened
in Japan,

10:20.052 --> 10:22.121
they have me translating manuals
in a basement.

10:22.188 --> 10:25.391
Does sound hard.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.892
Though maybe not as hard
as what happened

10:26.959 --> 10:29.195
to the two people
who were murdered.

10:30.997 --> 10:33.733
Yuki's death was
very upsetting for me.

10:33.799 --> 10:36.135
Of course.

10:33.799 --> 10:36.135
Were you close?

10:36.202 --> 10:38.204
We were friends.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.208
What about Yuki's boyfriend?

10:43.209 --> 10:44.810
Shogo Oda?

10:44.877 --> 10:47.713
You know him well?

10:48.314 --> 10:50.383
A little.

10:50.449 --> 10:52.251
He seemed nice.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.353
JESSE:
When was the last time
you saw him?

10:54.420 --> 10:56.122
Last year in Okinawa.

10:56.188 --> 10:59.158
A few days
before Yuki was killed.

10:59.225 --> 11:02.061
I actually felt bad for him.

11:02.128 --> 11:03.829
Because his girlfriend
was murdered.

11:03.896 --> 11:06.165
Because she was having
an affair.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.105
She was seeing another man?

11:13.172 --> 11:15.341
She wouldn't admit it,
but I knew.

11:15.408 --> 11:16.976
I overheard them once.

11:17.043 --> 11:18.411
Can you describe this man?

11:18.477 --> 11:20.079
I never actually saw him,

11:20.146 --> 11:22.281
but I think she was
scared of him.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.683
Do you think he might
be responsible

11:24.750 --> 11:26.285
for killing Yuki and Shogo?

11:26.352 --> 11:27.219
(door closes)

11:27.286 --> 11:29.321
Every single word
out of her mouth's a lie.

11:29.388 --> 11:31.757
What makes you think that?

11:29.388 --> 11:31.757
Instinct.

11:31.824 --> 11:33.292
She wants us to believe she's
like Amanda Knox, you know,

11:33.359 --> 11:36.128
an innocent caught up
in a bad situation.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.330
But every answer
feels calculated.

11:38.397 --> 11:40.800
Nothing she's offered can be
easily disproven.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.768
So let's go at her harder.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.270
Wear her down
till she makes a mistake.

11:44.336 --> 11:46.105
Right now, we don't have
much leverage.

11:46.172 --> 11:48.841
But Nelson's connection to both
these cases should be enough

11:48.908 --> 11:50.476
to get warrants for
her home and office.

11:50.543 --> 11:54.146
So let's start there, see if
we find anything we can use.

11:57.283 --> 11:59.718
Building manager really
doesn't like Nelson.

11:59.785 --> 12:01.120
Said the power went out once,

12:01.187 --> 12:03.322
and she yelled at him so
much, it made him cry.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.924
Mm, that's harsh.

12:04.990 --> 12:06.225
You know,
I bet she's one of

12:06.292 --> 12:08.394
those weird people
who hates karaoke.

12:08.461 --> 12:09.795
Hilarious.

Yes.

13:06.152 --> 13:09.421
I led the investigation
into Yuki Sawa's murder.

13:09.488 --> 13:10.890
You're a long way from home.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.391
I promised Yuki's family

13:12.458 --> 13:14.293
I would bring her killer
to justice.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.530
It doesn't matter
if that's here or in Japan.

13:17.596 --> 13:19.865
Doesn't excuse breaking

13:21.467 --> 13:23.068
My apologies.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.870
I should have come to you first.

13:26.906 --> 13:30.409
Your investigation zeroed in
on Abby Nelson very quickly.

13:30.476 --> 13:33.312
Only after we found
inconsistencies in her story.

13:33.379 --> 13:35.381
She admitted she discovered Yuki

13:35.447 --> 13:38.083
an hour before calling
the authorities.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.985
We learned she had, in fact,

13:40.052 --> 13:42.354
had breakfast in the room
next to Yuki's body.

13:42.421 --> 13:46.192
This woman found her roommate
murdered and then ate breakfast?

13:46.258 --> 13:48.427
She claimed she was in a daze.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.229
Didn't know what she was doing.

13:50.296 --> 13:52.498
Nelson said Yuki was having
an affair with another man.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.366
Did you look into him?

13:54.433 --> 13:57.303
She says a lot of things.
Most are untrue.

13:57.369 --> 14:00.072
There was no evidence
that any such man existed.

14:00.139 --> 14:02.308
So, why kill Shogo Oda now?

14:02.374 --> 14:04.843
Seems like she'd basically
gotten away with it.

14:04.910 --> 14:06.845
Because Shogo rejected her.

14:06.912 --> 14:09.415
He was on assignment
at the time of Yuki's murder.

14:09.481 --> 14:13.419
But when he returned,
he told me Abby had been...

14:13.485 --> 14:14.620
inappropriate.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.488
She came onto him?

14:16.555 --> 14:18.090
But he refused.

14:18.157 --> 14:20.459
He never imagined
Abby was dangerous.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.229
So, you think she was jealous.

14:23.295 --> 14:25.297
Killed Yuki to get her
out of the way.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.866
And given time
I would have proven it.

14:27.933 --> 14:29.401
But your government interfered

14:29.468 --> 14:32.471
and slipped her out
of the country.

14:33.272 --> 14:35.407
Special Agent Tennant,

14:35.474 --> 14:37.276
I know I overstepped.

14:37.343 --> 14:40.613
My experience with
American authorities has been...

14:40.679 --> 14:43.015
disappointing.

14:43.082 --> 14:45.217

with this investigation.

14:45.284 --> 14:46.352
I'm sure that...

14:45.284 --> 14:46.352
No, absolutely not.

14:46.418 --> 14:50.356
We have to ensure this
investigation remains impartial.

14:50.422 --> 14:53.926
Of course, that's
Agent Tennant's call.

14:54.526 --> 14:59.365
Unfortunately, there are a lot
of eyes on this case, Inspector.

14:59.431 --> 15:01.500

Sorry, habit.

15:16.682 --> 15:18.417

I'll call if there's
new information.

15:24.323 --> 15:26.392
That's your subtle way
of getting rid of me?

15:26.458 --> 15:28.627
I wasn't actually going
for subtle.

15:31.063 --> 15:32.464
I don't suppose you know
who gave the order

15:32.531 --> 15:34.667
to get Abby Nelson
out of Japan last year?

15:34.733 --> 15:36.568
(sighs) Not exactly.

15:36.635 --> 15:38.404
Order came from
the State Department,

15:38.470 --> 15:40.339
but nobody's
taking responsibility.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.339
I'm not surprised.

15:40.406 --> 15:42.341
It was a terrible decision.

15:42.408 --> 15:45.244
I imagine they thought they were
avoiding a diplomatic crisis.

15:45.311 --> 15:48.147
By letting a suspected killer
walk free?

15:48.747 --> 15:51.250

Only a couple places make it

Got her.

18:19.498 --> 18:22.501
Yeah, I guess I did.

What matters most to Abby is
looking out for herself.

18:43.722 --> 18:47.826
She's superficially charming
but lies without compunction.

18:47.893 --> 18:49.628

very well be a psychopath.

antisocial
personality disorder.

19:23.262 --> 19:24.897
You can have
psychopathic traits,

19:24.963 --> 19:27.666
like compulsive lying or being
unable to connect emotionally,

19:27.733 --> 19:29.801

along a spectrum.

19:29.868 --> 19:31.470

Having psychopathic traits
doesn't make someone a murderer.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.812
So, you said psychopaths have
a hard time

19:40.879 --> 19:42.714
connecting emotionally,
right?

19:42.781 --> 19:45.250
So does it make sense
Nelson killed Yuki

19:45.317 --> 19:46.585
'cause she was jealous?

19:46.652 --> 19:48.787
I mean, it does
if she's cold-blooded

19:48.854 --> 19:50.889
and wanted Yuki's
boyfriend for herself.

19:50.956 --> 19:53.825
I'm still not sure why
Inspector Mori was convinced

19:53.892 --> 19:55.861
that jealousy was the motive.

19:55.928 --> 19:58.230
Nothing in his interview
with Abby indicated that.

19:58.297 --> 20:00.198
You think he knows more
than he's telling us?

20:00.265 --> 20:01.833
I do.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.368
Want me to talk to him?

20:03.435 --> 20:06.338
Sure. Cop to cop might work.

20:09.374 --> 20:12.244
So, we just let her go?

20:12.511 --> 20:14.446
Not quite yet.

20:14.513 --> 20:16.748
♪ ♪

20:20.586 --> 20:21.720
You seem relaxed.

20:21.787 --> 20:24.856
A lot of people are scared
of polygraphs.

20:24.923 --> 20:26.825
I don't really do fear.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.727
I see that.

20:28.794 --> 20:30.829
I imagine it's probably
even hard

20:30.896 --> 20:33.332
for you to comprehend
on some level.

20:36.935 --> 20:38.804
It can be.

20:39.805 --> 20:41.940
Other emotions, too?

20:42.007 --> 20:44.676
Joy? Love?

20:44.743 --> 20:46.845
You sound like my old shrink.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.781
Is this an interrogation
or a session?

20:50.582 --> 20:52.784
I just want to understand.

20:57.623 --> 20:59.524
You're right.

20:59.591 --> 21:03.295
I don't experience love or joy
like most people.

21:03.362 --> 21:06.565
But that's not always
such a bad thing.

21:06.632 --> 21:09.901
I also don't struggle that much
with pain and grief.

21:09.968 --> 21:11.370
Heartbreak?

21:11.436 --> 21:12.504
I hear people
talk about it.

21:12.571 --> 21:13.772
I see it in the movies.

21:13.839 --> 21:17.576
But caring that much
just seems exhausting.

21:17.643 --> 21:19.311
And I'm fine with that.

21:19.378 --> 21:20.612
I've learned to
live with it.

21:20.679 --> 21:22.381
You must have to wear
a lot of masks

21:22.447 --> 21:23.815
just to get through a day.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.718
Don't you?

21:26.785 --> 21:29.921
Sometimes.
It comes with the job.

21:33.425 --> 21:35.761
I'm not stupid.

21:36.795 --> 21:39.398
I know you're just trying
to get me to talk

21:39.464 --> 21:41.400
by being sympathetic
or something.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.935
I do need you
to be honest with me.

21:44.002 --> 21:47.939
You lied the last time we spoke
about seeing Shogo.

21:49.374 --> 21:51.977
I knew you'd just suspect me
like the cops did before.

21:52.044 --> 21:53.612
If you're innocent,

21:53.679 --> 21:57.382
catching the killer is
in your best interest.

21:57.449 --> 21:59.484
What did Shogo say to you?

21:59.551 --> 22:01.019
Am I under arrest?

22:01.086 --> 22:02.821
Abby.

22:04.623 --> 22:06.892
Because otherwise,
I'm free to go, right?

22:08.894 --> 22:10.429
For now.

22:15.500 --> 22:18.036
The tea was a nice touch.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.608
This chef is shin-issei.

22:23.675 --> 22:26.078
He moved from Japan
a couple years ago.

22:26.144 --> 22:27.813
Shin-issei?

22:27.879 --> 22:30.449
You know much about
Japanese culture.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.551
I love it.

22:33.785 --> 22:35.654
We should order
fugu, then.

22:37.456 --> 22:38.890
Fugu?

22:38.957 --> 22:41.927
Pufferfish, a delicacy.

22:41.993 --> 22:45.363
Though the toxin it contains
can poison and kill

22:45.430 --> 22:47.466
if not prepared correctly.

22:51.737 --> 22:54.873
Uh, two of
your finest fugu,

22:54.940 --> 22:57.042
my friend.

23:01.446 --> 23:03.815
Think you've been
holding out on us.

23:04.649 --> 23:06.985
I gave you our murder file.

23:07.052 --> 23:10.122
But both of us know
that's not everything.

23:10.188 --> 23:13.091
I mean, no seasoned cop lays
all their cards

23:13.158 --> 23:14.860
on the table up front.

23:16.828 --> 23:19.598
It eats away at you,
doesn't it?

23:19.664 --> 23:20.832
(smacks lips)

23:20.899 --> 23:25.036
Not being able to bring justice
for Yuki Sawa and her family?

23:25.103 --> 23:27.639
I haven't given up.

23:27.706 --> 23:30.942
Yeah, I got my own case
like that.

23:31.009 --> 23:33.111
Jessica Gains.

23:33.178 --> 23:36.982
She was a senior at
Georgetown University.

23:37.048 --> 23:40.886
Strangled a week
before her graduation.

23:42.954 --> 23:46.858
Found DNA
but didn't get a match.

23:47.826 --> 23:51.129
I ask the lab to run it
once a year.

23:51.196 --> 23:53.799
Hope to find a hit.

24:01.673 --> 24:05.143
Americans stole Yuki's
killer before.

24:05.210 --> 24:06.945
Why should I trust you?

24:07.012 --> 24:09.214
Because we want the same thing.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.916
Do we?

24:15.020 --> 24:16.588
Trust.

24:22.594 --> 24:25.130
We held this back
from the media.

24:25.197 --> 24:27.833
It belongs to Abby Nelson.

24:27.899 --> 24:30.468
And it's why I know

24:30.535 --> 24:32.737
she killed Yuki Sawa.

24:36.174 --> 24:37.709
JESSE:
I mean, Nelson wasn't just

24:37.776 --> 24:38.743
jealous of Yuki.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.011
She was obsessed with her.

24:40.078 --> 24:42.147
She wrote down everywhere
they went together,

24:42.214 --> 24:43.148
everybody Yuki talked to.

24:43.215 --> 24:44.816
Even small things,

24:44.883 --> 24:46.885
like what she ate,
what movie she was watching.

24:46.952 --> 24:48.620
Anything on the man

24:48.687 --> 24:49.988
she was supposedly
having an affair with?

24:50.055 --> 24:51.790
Not that I can find.

24:51.857 --> 24:53.625
Yeah, which probably means
Abby made him up.

24:53.692 --> 24:55.093
Not necessarily.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.628
I mean, if she thought
this guy was dangerous,

24:56.695 --> 24:58.029
she would've mentioned him
somewhere.

24:58.096 --> 24:59.831
Well, we can't know that
because we don't know

24:59.898 --> 25:01.233
why Abby kept the journal
in the first place.

25:01.299 --> 25:02.601
JESSE:
Well, like Inspector Mori said,

25:02.667 --> 25:03.969
because she was jealous.

25:04.035 --> 25:05.837
But just because you guys
might consider it

25:05.904 --> 25:08.039
important enough to include,
doesn't mean Abby would.

25:08.106 --> 25:09.875
That's, uh... (chuckles)

25:09.941 --> 25:11.676
It's very neurotypical thinking.

25:11.743 --> 25:13.278
TENNANT:
Ernie's right.

25:13.345 --> 25:16.047
We know that Abby thinks
differently than most people.

25:16.114 --> 25:18.917
Do we have access
to Yuki's social media yet?

25:16.114 --> 25:18.917
Yeah.

25:18.984 --> 25:21.019
The Japanese government
came through, got us permission.

25:21.086 --> 25:22.187
Okay, let's compare
these dates and times

25:22.254 --> 25:24.022
in this journal to Yuki's posts.

25:24.089 --> 25:26.591
See if we can find any
connections to the mystery man.

25:26.658 --> 25:27.592
I'll help.

25:27.659 --> 25:29.661
I love a good Insta-snoop.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.530
MILIUS:
Well...

25:32.597 --> 25:34.666
finally made some headway.

25:34.733 --> 25:36.201
We've been making
some progress ourselves.

25:36.268 --> 25:38.270
(sighs) Saved you a seat,
Captain.

25:38.336 --> 25:40.071
Make yourself at home.

25:40.138 --> 25:41.640
Appreciate that, Boone.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.909
But I think we'll be
taking a field trip.

25:43.975 --> 25:46.011
I figured out who wanted
Abby Nelson out of Japan.

25:46.077 --> 25:47.245
Did the State Department
finally come clean?

25:47.312 --> 25:49.915
They were just doing
what they were asked.

25:49.981 --> 25:51.182
The request to remove her
actually came

25:51.249 --> 25:53.151
from the Japanese themselves.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.022
She was accused of killing
one of their own citizens.

25:57.088 --> 25:58.556
Why would they want her
sent away?

25:58.623 --> 25:59.858
Excellent question.

25:59.925 --> 26:01.693
Why don't we go ask them?

26:01.760 --> 26:03.194
(indistinct chatter)

26:04.195 --> 26:05.931
Commander.

26:09.167 --> 26:10.235
You have news?

26:10.302 --> 26:11.803
Actually,
we have questions.

26:11.870 --> 26:13.138
We're in the middle
of a simulation.

26:13.204 --> 26:15.874
I will make my men available
as soon as we're done.

26:15.941 --> 26:17.242
Our question is for you.

26:19.711 --> 26:21.179
What do you need?

26:21.246 --> 26:23.081
Your government had Abby Nelson
removed from Japan

26:23.148 --> 26:25.083
in the middle of
a murder investigation.

26:25.150 --> 26:26.785
We'd like to know why.

26:26.851 --> 26:28.620
I'm sorry.
I know nothing about this.

26:28.687 --> 26:31.089
Commander, two members of
your unit have been killed.

26:31.156 --> 26:34.092
We can't help if we don't have
all the information.

26:34.893 --> 26:37.829
People I answer to wanted
the American woman gone.

26:37.896 --> 26:40.165
The publicity
around the murder was

26:40.231 --> 26:42.734
on the verge of exploding,
possibly harming

26:42.801 --> 26:46.004
the cooperation between
our two countries irreversibly.

26:46.071 --> 26:48.206
Wasn't the publicity worse
when she got away with it?

26:48.273 --> 26:50.675
For a short time,
but then it blew over,

26:50.742 --> 26:52.944
as they knew it would.

26:53.011 --> 26:54.612
It would not have been necessary

26:54.679 --> 26:57.248
if the investigation had
not been so badly mishandled.

26:58.249 --> 27:01.219
You think the Okinawa
detectives made mistakes?

27:01.286 --> 27:04.022
They failed Yuki, and now
Shogo has paid the price.

27:04.089 --> 27:08.026
I'm ashamed of the choices
my countrymen made.

27:08.093 --> 27:10.929
We should never have
allowed her to leave.

27:15.333 --> 27:16.901
(door lock beeps)

27:18.136 --> 27:20.872
You two get anything useful
off Yuki's social media?

27:20.939 --> 27:22.374
No sign of her mystery
boyfriend.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.242
But we did find something else.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.210
Yes.

27:25.276 --> 27:27.278
Yuki's feeds are mostly filled
with friends

27:27.345 --> 27:28.747
from her unit.

27:28.813 --> 27:30.315
But look at Abby's posts
from last year

27:30.382 --> 27:32.317
around the time of the murder.

27:33.251 --> 27:34.686
TENNANT:
They're almost identical.

27:34.753 --> 27:36.721
And that's no accident.

27:37.889 --> 27:39.157
LUCY:
Abby was imitating her.

27:39.224 --> 27:42.227
Which is also what
her journal was really for.

27:42.293 --> 27:44.129
She wasn't jealous of Yuki.

27:44.195 --> 27:46.131
She was studying her.

27:46.197 --> 27:49.000
Trying to figure out how to
fit in and appear more normal.

27:49.067 --> 27:51.669
Well, though normal's
highly overrated.

27:51.736 --> 27:54.039
It seems like
they got along well.

27:54.105 --> 27:56.141
And if Abby wasn't
jealous of Yuki,

27:56.207 --> 27:58.243
it pretty much
eliminates motive.

27:56.207 --> 27:58.243
And the truth is,

27:58.309 --> 28:00.345
no one has found
any real evidence against her,

28:00.412 --> 28:02.947
either here or in Okinawa.

28:03.014 --> 28:05.683
What if she's actually innocent?

28:05.750 --> 28:08.019
Well, Inspector Mori's team
focused on Abby so early,

28:08.086 --> 28:10.789
they didn't even look
at other suspects.

28:12.057 --> 28:16.061
But if Abby didn't commit
either murder, who did?

28:22.267 --> 28:23.902
(entry bells jingle)

28:27.105 --> 28:30.375
From the dent in that bottle,
I'm guessing you got my message.

28:30.442 --> 28:33.211
You believe Abby Nelson
is innocent?

28:33.278 --> 28:36.314
Still just a theory,
but...

28:36.381 --> 28:38.149
yeah, we think
it's pretty likely.

28:38.216 --> 28:39.851
Whiskey, rocks. Thanks.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.989
I was so sure Nelson was guilty.

28:47.158 --> 28:49.227
Menboku mo nai.

28:49.294 --> 28:52.097
I've lost face.

28:52.163 --> 28:53.998
Let down my country,

28:54.065 --> 28:58.002
Yuki's family, myself.

28:58.069 --> 29:00.038
Look, I'm...

29:00.105 --> 29:03.808
not actually that knowledgeable
about Japanese culture.

29:03.875 --> 29:06.811
Thank you.

29:03.875 --> 29:06.811
Here you go.

29:06.878 --> 29:09.948
But isn't there a saying?

29:10.014 --> 29:14.419
Something about falling
down seven times,

29:14.486 --> 29:16.488
and getting up eight?

29:18.890 --> 29:21.092
Come work with us.

29:21.159 --> 29:23.828
Help us figure out
who the suspects should've been.

29:23.895 --> 29:27.265
Special Agent Tennant
will not allow it.

29:27.332 --> 29:29.100
She sent me.

29:30.168 --> 29:32.537
We got to start
at the beginning,

But we're being open-minded,
right?

30:23.454 --> 30:25.156
Yes.

30:25.223 --> 30:26.491
Good morning.

30:26.558 --> 30:28.059
Morning.

30:28.126 --> 30:31.029
Yuki and Shogo were
in the same unit.

30:31.095 --> 30:33.198
Not that many other friends.

30:33.264 --> 30:35.366
LUCY:
All of those men were
in Okinawa last year

30:35.433 --> 30:36.601
and are here now.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.236
Makes them the most
likely suspects.

30:38.303 --> 30:40.205
Did Yuki have any problems
with anyone from her unit?

30:40.271 --> 30:42.207
Not that we discovered.

30:42.273 --> 30:43.441
Well, whoever it was,
she trusted them enough

30:43.508 --> 30:45.243
to let them into her apartment.

30:45.310 --> 30:47.512
It's been a year since Yuki's
murder. Why kill Shogo?

30:47.579 --> 30:49.847
Maybe Abby was telling
the truth about what he said.

30:49.914 --> 30:52.283
That he believed
she was innocent.

30:49.914 --> 30:52.283
And Shogo was getting

30:52.350 --> 30:54.319
too close to identifying
the real killer?

30:54.385 --> 30:55.987
LUCY:
Well, if it's
one of these guys,

30:56.054 --> 30:57.855
we don't have that much time
to figure it out.

30:57.922 --> 30:59.324
Iron Cloud wraps up tomorrow.

30:59.390 --> 31:01.092
The whole unit will be
on a plane home

31:01.159 --> 31:02.560
right after the farewell party.

31:02.627 --> 31:05.396
Let's go over all
their statements again.

31:02.627 --> 31:05.396
(phone vibrates)

31:05.463 --> 31:07.999
Chase just got the
autopsy photos from Okinawa.

31:08.066 --> 31:09.267
She's got questions
for you, Inspector.

31:09.334 --> 31:11.469
Okay.

31:09.334 --> 31:11.469
I'll take him.

31:11.536 --> 31:13.438
Thanks.

31:13.504 --> 31:15.240
Yeah.

31:15.306 --> 31:18.543
Try not to look
quite so chipper.

31:20.311 --> 31:21.479
Were you able to determine

31:21.546 --> 31:23.381
whether the victim was
sitting or standing?

31:23.448 --> 31:25.450
According to our forensics,
standing.

31:25.516 --> 31:29.120
That makes depth and placement
of the wounds extremely similar.

31:29.187 --> 31:31.389
So, same killer?

31:32.423 --> 31:34.158
Despite the whispers
in the hallways,

31:34.225 --> 31:36.160
I'm not actually a psychic.

31:36.227 --> 31:38.429
"Similar" is as far
as I can go.

31:41.499 --> 31:43.534
This is my fault.

31:44.335 --> 31:47.038
Hey, you know that's not true.

31:47.105 --> 31:49.307
My own people believe I failed

31:49.374 --> 31:51.342
at the job I was
entrusted with.

31:51.409 --> 31:54.379
Hey, you didn't fail.
You just haven't succeeded yet.

32:00.018 --> 32:02.654
I've seen this before.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.489
What is this?

32:04.555 --> 32:06.357
A military award.

32:09.427 --> 32:12.430
These things were all found
with Shogo Oda?

32:12.497 --> 32:13.598
Yes.

32:13.665 --> 32:16.167
They'll be returned to his
family as soon as possible.

32:16.234 --> 32:19.304
This commemorates
Operation Kagemusha.

32:19.370 --> 32:21.506
But that was over ten years ago.

32:21.572 --> 32:24.575
Shogo's too young
to have participated.

32:25.243 --> 32:28.246
Wait. I know where I saw this.

32:30.682 --> 32:33.584
Yeah. There.

32:33.651 --> 32:36.321
Nisa Tanaka.

32:36.387 --> 32:38.556
Why would Shogo have
his medal?

32:38.623 --> 32:42.560
Not sure,
but I know who we should ask.

32:42.627 --> 32:44.562
(door opens)

32:45.530 --> 32:49.200
Abby. Thanks so much
for coming back.

32:49.267 --> 32:50.501
This is getting tiresome.

32:50.568 --> 32:51.602
I already told you
everything I know.

32:51.669 --> 32:54.005
I'm hoping that's not true.

32:55.540 --> 32:56.708
What is he doing here?

32:56.774 --> 32:58.209
Abby, take a breath.

32:59.510 --> 33:01.579
Have a seat.

33:02.714 --> 33:04.649
Please.

33:05.783 --> 33:08.219
(exhales shakily)

33:16.327 --> 33:18.496
I know that was hard.

33:18.563 --> 33:21.299
Inspector Mori has
something he wants to say.

33:22.633 --> 33:25.503
Nelson-san...

33:25.570 --> 33:27.572
(speaking Japanese)

33:29.240 --> 33:32.610
I have done you
a great disservice.

33:32.677 --> 33:33.578
(speaking Japanese)

33:33.644 --> 33:35.413
What is this?

33:35.480 --> 33:37.548
Some kind of trick?

33:35.480 --> 33:37.548
No tricks.

33:37.615 --> 33:41.219
We don't believe you killed
Yuki Sawa or Shogo Oda.

33:41.285 --> 33:42.453
I told you I didn't.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.288
We need to know
what Shogo said to you

33:44.355 --> 33:45.490
when you met him
at the noodle place.

33:45.556 --> 33:49.260
Did he know who
Yuki's killer was?

33:51.462 --> 33:53.197
No, but he thought
it was someone

33:53.264 --> 33:54.599
in the Japanese military.

33:54.665 --> 33:56.567
Why did he think that?

33:56.634 --> 34:00.405
Last month, he received
a box from Yuki's parents.

34:00.471 --> 34:03.408
Personal items
they thought belonged to him.

34:03.474 --> 34:05.777
He found some kind
of medal inside.

34:05.843 --> 34:07.512
But it wasn't his.

34:07.578 --> 34:08.646
Shogo thought
it might belong to

34:08.713 --> 34:10.548
whoever killed Yuki.

34:11.349 --> 34:13.351
We believe it belonged

34:11.349 --> 34:13.351
to this man.

34:15.553 --> 34:17.255
That's it.

34:17.321 --> 34:20.324
That's the medal
that Shogo showed me.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.493
Did this guy kill
Yuki and Shogo?

34:22.560 --> 34:24.662
We think it's possible.

34:24.729 --> 34:28.199
But just like in Japan,
there's no hard evidence.

34:28.266 --> 34:30.368
So, what happens now?

34:30.435 --> 34:32.103
You can't just let him
get away with it.

34:32.170 --> 34:33.404
We're hoping he doesn't.

34:33.471 --> 34:35.473
Not if you agree
to help us.

34:35.540 --> 34:36.641
Me?

34:36.707 --> 34:38.609
There's a chance
we can take him down.

34:38.676 --> 34:42.180
But it's risky.

34:42.246 --> 34:45.483
And it all depends on you.

34:52.657 --> 34:54.692

35:09.340 --> 35:11.442
You think Abby
can pull this off?

35:11.509 --> 35:12.510
TENNANT:
Let's hope so.

35:12.577 --> 35:15.446
She's the only person Tanaka
might actually believe.

35:15.513 --> 35:17.482
If she can't get
a confession out of him,

35:17.548 --> 35:19.750
he's on a plane
out of here.

35:19.817 --> 35:21.486
We close?

35:21.552 --> 35:22.854
JESSE:
Almost.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.489
Don't let Tanaka get you alone.

35:24.555 --> 35:25.656
If we're not alone,
he won't talk.

35:25.723 --> 35:28.726
We'll be close, but he's proven
he's handy with a blade.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.561
I'm not worried.

35:30.628 --> 35:33.498
But you should be,
at least a little.

35:33.564 --> 35:34.665
We're counting on
your fearlessness,

35:34.732 --> 35:36.634
but a little fear's
a good thing.

35:36.701 --> 35:38.269
Keeps you breathing.

35:38.336 --> 35:39.804
Fine. I'll be careful.

35:39.871 --> 35:41.405
You got this.

35:42.473 --> 35:44.575
I'll cover the far path.

35:48.479 --> 35:50.381
So, we're really
gonna do this here?

35:50.448 --> 35:52.216
I think it's
our best chance.

35:52.283 --> 35:53.651
Do you trust me?

35:53.718 --> 35:55.419
Absolutely.

35:55.486 --> 35:58.389
Doesn't mean I have to
like it, though.

35:58.456 --> 36:00.758
All right, let's do this.
Send her in.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.693
Wish us luck.

36:05.763 --> 36:08.399
Next year, we should consider
expanding the exercise.

36:08.466 --> 36:10.434
Commander Tanaka, right?

36:10.501 --> 36:12.937
Shogo told me
so much about you.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.540
You. What are you doing here?

36:15.606 --> 36:17.508
Oh, good.
You know who I am.

36:17.575 --> 36:19.377
That makes this so much easier.

36:19.443 --> 36:21.712
We have a lot
to talk about.

36:21.779 --> 36:23.748
Do you mind if I steal him
for a second?

36:23.814 --> 36:25.950
We have some unfinished business
from Okinawa.

36:26.017 --> 36:28.319
Excuse me. Be right back.

36:28.386 --> 36:29.854
(quiet chatter)

36:29.921 --> 36:31.455
Lucy, Kai,

36:31.522 --> 36:33.524
(over comm):
give them room but stay close.

36:33.591 --> 36:34.492
He'll never talk.

36:34.559 --> 36:37.862
Hey, never underestimate
the neuro-divergent.

36:40.698 --> 36:42.700
(quiet chatter, laughter)

36:45.736 --> 36:47.405
How dare you threaten me.

36:47.471 --> 36:49.807
Shogo told me
that you killed Yuki.

36:49.874 --> 36:50.641
(scoffs)

36:50.708 --> 36:52.410
Ridiculous.

36:52.910 --> 36:54.645
This belongs to you.

36:54.712 --> 36:56.781
Shogo gave it to me
for safekeeping.

36:56.847 --> 36:58.649
Said he was scared of you.

36:56.847 --> 36:58.649
Give me that.

36:58.716 --> 37:01.752
Maybe, after you
wire me 50 grand.

37:01.819 --> 37:03.654
Or maybe we
should go back

37:03.721 --> 37:05.756
and continue the discussion
with your friends.

37:06.924 --> 37:09.226
He might be going
for a weapon.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.729

37:14.031 --> 37:15.800
Did she reject you?

37:15.866 --> 37:18.636
Tell you how much better
in bed Shogo was than you?

37:18.703 --> 37:20.237
I mean,
he was so much younger.

37:20.304 --> 37:21.939
Shut your mouth.

37:22.006 --> 37:23.641
Never meant to kill her.

to control

37:25.343 --> 37:26.310

37:26.377 --> 37:27.678
But Shogo was no impulse.

37:27.745 --> 37:29.847
You executed him
to save yourself.

37:27.745 --> 37:29.847
Yes.

37:29.914 --> 37:32.016
That's it, we got him.
