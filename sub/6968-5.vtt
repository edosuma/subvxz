- Find the prisoner!
- Find the prisoner!

00:42.704 --> 00:45.238
There's
been a mistake! Get me a lawyer.

00:49.105 --> 00:52.105
- Where is the king?
- In the great hall, sire.

00:52.772 --> 00:54.905
- Enough! To thy post!
- Aye, sire!

00:57.506 --> 00:58.973
To the great hall.

01:27.642 --> 01:29.509
I can't breathe!

01:37.143 --> 01:39.177
No. No. Not again!

Episode 05 - Duane Barry

02:54.151 --> 02:56.084
Hello, Duane.
Nice to see you.

02:57.184 --> 02:58.951
Nice to see
You too, Doc.

03:01.285 --> 03:03.485
- How ya feelin' today?
- Pretty good.

03:04.285 --> 03:06.252
Why don't we
sit down, Duane?

03:06.652 --> 03:09.186
- I wanna go over a few things with ya.
- Okay.

03:09.619 --> 03:11.186
Now, it says here...

03:13.053 --> 03:15.520
that you've been
refusing to take your medicine.

03:16.453 --> 03:19.387
- I don't like the way it makes me feel.
- Okay. All right.

03:20.720 --> 03:22.387
Let's talk about that.

03:22.587 --> 03:24.854
Because we give you that
medicine for a reason, Duane.

03:24.854 --> 03:27.287
- Because of your behavior.
- I know. I know.

03:28.621 --> 03:31.021
Because we don't want you
to hurt anybody again.

03:32.221 --> 03:34.855
- You still hearing voices?
- I'm not crazy, Doc.

03:36.755 --> 03:38.455
Duane Barry's not
like these other guys.

03:38.455 --> 03:40.455
No, everybody here
is different.

03:40.455 --> 03:43.356
They're comin' again.
They're comin' again. I can feel it.

03:44.789 --> 03:48.156
- They're gonna take Duane Barry
to the place.
- Nobody's comin', Duane.

03:51.490 --> 03:53.057
Nobody can stop 'em.

03:55.557 --> 03:57.357
I'm gonna give you a shot.

03:58.691 --> 04:00.557
I think you just
need some rest.

04:00.891 --> 04:02.558
This'll make you sleep.

04:03.358 --> 04:06.225
When you wake up, you'll see
we didn't let anybody hurt you.

04:06.225 --> 04:08.225
- Okay, Duane?

04:09.458 --> 04:10.558
Duane?

04:15.659 --> 04:17.358
- Duane!

04:17.492 --> 04:19.059
Get away.
Get away.

04:20.059 --> 04:21.660
- Do it, man!
- Put down the gun, Duane.

04:21.660 --> 04:23.493
- Gimme the keys.
- Duane.

04:23.493 --> 04:25.093
Gimme the damn keys!

04:25.260 --> 04:27.927
- Yeah, do it, man!

04:28.760 --> 04:30.927
- No! Nooo!

04:30.927 --> 04:33.994
Either way, Doc, we're gettin'
outta here together. You got it?

04:34.094 --> 04:36.028
Let's go now!
Go! Go! Go!

04:45.262 --> 04:46.629
Agent Mulder!

04:47.895 --> 04:49.462
Krycek.
What's up?

04:52.463 --> 04:54.363
There's a situation
going down.

04:54.363 --> 04:57.330
- They want you out there right away.
- What kind of situation?

04:57.696 --> 04:59.263
Hostage negotiation.

04:59.297 --> 05:01.130
- And they want me?
- Yeah.

05:01.430 --> 05:03.730
- What for?
- A guy escaped a mental institution.

05:03.730 --> 05:07.597
He's got four people at gunpoint
in an office. Claims he's
being controlled by aliens.

05:11.098 --> 05:13.398
Stay back behind the barrier!

05:13.665 --> 05:15.698
Police! Stay back!

05:17.532 --> 05:20.999
- Krycek, Mulder, F.B.I.
Where's the command post?
- Right that way, sir.

05:28.366 --> 05:30.100
- Yes, sir!
- Okay, I got it right here
in front of me.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.767
- Get him on the horn!
- Lucy.

05:35.034 --> 05:37.034
Come down these A.C. vents.

05:37.167 --> 05:39.334
You can put people
on the third and fourth floor.

05:39.334 --> 05:41.101
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah.

05:41.201 --> 05:42.934
Lucy Kazdin, negotiation commander.
Thanks for coming.

05:42.934 --> 05:45.768
- This is Agent Krycek.
- Let me show you what we've got.

05:48.968 --> 05:51.602
His name's Duane Barry.
He's armed with a nine-millimeter...

05:51.602 --> 05:53.935
Smith and Wesson handgun,
one nine-round magazine.

05:53.935 --> 05:56.536
It is our belief that he's prepared
to use the gun and not afraid to die.

05:56.536 --> 05:59.069
- What does he want?
- Safe passage for himself...

05:59.069 --> 06:01.169
and his original hostage,
a shrink named Hakkie.

06:01.169 --> 06:03.636
- Passage to where?
- He's bent on taking...

06:03.803 --> 06:05.470
the doctor with him
to an alien abduction site.

06:05.470 --> 06:07.970
Only he can't
quite remember where the site is,
so he stopped at a travel agency.

06:07.970 --> 06:11.204
- Is he lucid?
- Yes. But he's off his medication,
so he's manic...

06:11.904 --> 06:13.637
ranting about scoop marks,
scars on his body,

06:13.637 --> 06:15.304
homing devices
and a lot of other nonsense.

06:15.304 --> 06:18.605
- Like what?
- This alien abduction business,
which I guess you know about.

06:18.605 --> 06:21.538
Yeah, yeah. But I've never been
in a hostage negotiation before.

06:21.538 --> 06:23.905
Oh, we'll take you through it.
Agent Rich is our advisory commander.

06:23.905 --> 06:25.472
He and I will
be coaching you.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.072
What Mr. Barry needs
right now is a friend,

06:27.072 --> 06:30.572
someone who appears to understand him
and can appeal to his sense of reason.

06:31.272 --> 06:33.973
Do we know anything about
his abduction experiences?

06:35.706 --> 06:37.473
You really believe in this stuff,
Agent Mulder?

06:37.473 --> 06:39.007
Is that a problem?

06:40.707 --> 06:43.807
We're here to save lives.
You'll begin negotiations immediately.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.674
Every three hours, we'll
reevaluate your progress...

06:47.241 --> 06:50.474
and let our tactical commander
advise and update on the use of force.

06:58.042 --> 07:00.875
If this man is an abductee,
I need to know more about him.

07:00.875 --> 07:03.609
His personal history.
Each abduction case is different.

07:03.609 --> 07:06.009
That material has not
been made available to us.

07:06.009 --> 07:07.709
And nobody's thought
to call the hospital for records?

07:07.709 --> 07:10.010
Look, Agent Mulder.
The guy is a psycho.

07:10.710 --> 07:12.543
Your object is
to keep him on the phone.

07:12.543 --> 07:15.510
The longer you do, the more chance
he's not gonna kill anybody.

07:15.510 --> 07:19.277
We stop to do a Freudian analysis,
next thing we know
we've got four dead hostages.

07:19.311 --> 07:22.178
So whatever crap you gotta make up
about spacemen or UFOs,

07:23.244 --> 07:25.045
just keep him on the phone.

07:28.878 --> 07:31.779
Are we gonna have to sit on the floor
like this all night?

07:34.045 --> 07:35.679
I told you to shut up.

07:35.712 --> 07:37.912
We all have families,
for God's sake.

07:42.280 --> 07:44.313
Duane, don't hurt anyone.

07:44.446 --> 07:46.747
- Please?
- I'm not gonna hurt you, Doc.

07:49.614 --> 07:52.181
Because this time you're
going with Duane Barry...

07:53.381 --> 07:55.314
so you can see
what it's like.

07:56.381 --> 07:57.881
That's it's real!

08:03.948 --> 08:06.682
- Duane?

08:06.982 --> 08:08.382
Yeah?

08:08.649 --> 08:10.716
This is
Special Agent Fox Mulder.

08:11.182 --> 08:13.716
- Look, I wanna try to help you.
- Yeah? Well...

08:14.649 --> 08:17.383
We're just sittin' here
waitin' for, uh, travel plans.

08:17.850 --> 08:20.383
I think I know what
You're going through, Duane.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.317
I just wanna make sure
You get what you want...

08:22.317 --> 08:25.217
and that Bob, Kimberly,
Gwen and Dr. Hakkie don't get hurt.

08:26.151 --> 08:28.184
You know what
I'm goin' through?

08:29.218 --> 08:31.918
You think you know what
Duane Barry's goin' through?

08:32.284 --> 08:34.318
You don't know jack!

08:34.684 --> 08:36.585
I know
You're scared, Duane,

08:37.052 --> 08:38.751
and that you'd like
to see this all come out right.

08:38.751 --> 08:40.052
Yeah, right.

08:40.852 --> 08:43.186
So they can put me back
in the nuthouse...

08:43.318 --> 08:44.719
where I belong.

08:44.986 --> 08:48.119
We're only concerned about your safety,
Duane. You and the others.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.387
Hey, what's your name?
Mul-der?

08:55.054 --> 08:56.587
I know the routine:

08:58.154 --> 09:00.254
honesty, containment,
conciliation.

09:02.321 --> 09:04.021
Am I missin' somethin'?

09:04.354 --> 09:06.355
You need someone
to trust, Duane.

09:06.355 --> 09:09.355
I know a lot of people
who've been through similar experiences.

09:09.355 --> 09:11.789
You wanna do something
for me, Agent Mulder?

09:12.489 --> 09:15.922
You keep your dogs on a leash. You try
to gas me out or do anything stupid,

09:16.489 --> 09:17.956
these people die.

09:18.156 --> 09:20.323
They're not takin' me again.
You gotit?

09:22.023 --> 09:25.290
- They can take somebody else!
- Nobody's gonna try anything, Duane.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.257
- Who is this guy?

09:27.257 --> 09:29.590
- He's F.B.I., isn't he?
- Former F.B.I.

09:30.757 --> 09:32.357
And you didn't
think to mention that.

09:32.357 --> 09:34.624
He's been out of the Bureau
since 1982.

09:34.757 --> 09:37.258
Institutionalized on and off for
over a decade. It's beside the point.

09:37.258 --> 09:40.358
The point being that the Bureau
wants to minimize its embarrassment,
isn't that it?

09:40.358 --> 09:43.925
- That we can police our own?
- They would like it done
as neatly as possible.

09:44.558 --> 09:47.559
- You're off to a hell of a start.
- Negotiation is a process.

09:48.926 --> 09:51.592
If you wanted somebody to read
the script, you didn't have to bring me.

09:51.592 --> 09:55.026
This method has proven
extremely successful in winning
the hostage taker's trust.

09:55.026 --> 09:56.826
N-No.
That man is afraid.

09:56.926 --> 09:58.527
And the only way you're gonna
win his trust is by trying...

09:58.527 --> 10:00.360
to understand
what he is afraid of.

10:00.360 --> 10:02.894
Have you ever spoken
to an abductee, Agent Kazdin?

10:02.894 --> 10:05.061
Heard them talk about having their brain
sucked out through their nostril...

10:05.061 --> 10:06.661
while being wide awake
through the experience?

10:06.694 --> 10:09.361
- Would you like to know what
they do to a woman's ovaries?
- Not particularly.

10:09.361 --> 10:12.828
Well, understand that you might have to
alter your approach a little bit here.

10:18.629 --> 10:20.829
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yeah.

10:21.395 --> 10:23.296
- What's your name again?
- Krycek.

10:23.296 --> 10:25.363
Krycek, have you
got your notepad?

10:25.563 --> 10:28.430
Grande, two percent cappuccino
with vanilla. Agent Rich?

10:32.597 --> 10:35.030
As you can see, Carl, the SWAT team...

10:35.030 --> 10:37.430
- has taken positions on all
the surrounding buildings.

10:37.430 --> 10:39.597
- Scully.
- It's me. I'm in Virginia.

10:40.031 --> 10:41.898
Yeah, I know. I've
been watching it on TV.

10:41.898 --> 10:44.098
- What's going on out there?
- What's the media saying?

10:44.098 --> 10:47.298
That an escaped mental patient
is holding four people hostage
in a travel agency.

10:47.298 --> 10:50.998
What they're not telling you
is that he's former F.B.I. who
also claims to be an alien abductee.

10:50.998 --> 10:53.765
- Seriously?
- Yeah. His name is Duane Barry.
Look, Scully, I need your help.

10:53.765 --> 10:55.666
I need you to find out
what happened to him.

10:55.666 --> 10:57.799
Anything... transcripts from
therapy sessions, hypnotic progressions.

10:57.799 --> 11:00.133
Anything about
his abduction experience...

11:01.199 --> 11:03.566
- Mulder?
- The lights just went out here.

11:04.733 --> 11:08.000
No, we're losing power.
- What the hell is going on?

11:13.401 --> 11:16.268
- Tactical unit,
what are you guys up to?

11:16.601 --> 11:18.868
Nothing. Absolutely nothing,
sir. What the...

11:21.201 --> 11:22.868
Get down!
Everybody get down!

11:22.868 --> 11:24.935
Tactical command, shots have
been fired. Locate and report.

11:24.935 --> 11:26.602
- Repeat. Locate and report.

11:34.869 --> 11:38.103
- We've lost our captured line.
- We have four or five shots fired!

11:38.570 --> 11:40.637
- What's the number in there?
- 555-2804.

11:40.637 --> 11:43.004
- I repeat. We have either
four or five shots fired!

11:43.004 --> 11:46.337
- A substation blew. We've got
no power up and down the block.

11:46.337 --> 11:49.204
Duane? Is everyone all right?
- I told ya.

11:49.338 --> 11:52.105
- You didn't believe me, did you?
- No, I believe you.

11:52.171 --> 11:54.538
I just need to know
if anybody's been shot.

11:54.705 --> 11:56.972
- I need towels. Kimberly?

11:58.072 --> 12:00.339
Kimberly? He's going
to bleed to death.

12:00.972 --> 12:03.039
I guess we're
gonna need a doctor.

12:10.406 --> 12:12.873
Now, you'll have almost
frull ambient hearing loss in this ear.

12:12.873 --> 12:14.673
Your sense of balance
may be affected slightly,

12:14.673 --> 12:17.574
particularly if you have to move quickly
or get into a physical situation.

12:17.574 --> 12:20.474
If you get trapped or held
in the building for some reason,

12:20.674 --> 12:23.174
we'll be able to warn you
if there's a tactical assault.

12:23.174 --> 12:26.008
Now, remember, he's either
got four or five rounds left.

12:26.075 --> 12:28.942
There's a wireless mike hidden
in the top of this flak jacket.

12:28.942 --> 12:30.575
Speaking in
a normal tone of voice,

12:30.575 --> 12:32.209
we should be able to hear anything
You say up to a hundred yards.

12:32.209 --> 12:34.709
Make every attempt to keep
these devices concealed.

12:34.709 --> 12:36.309
You put a normal telephone
handset to that ear,

12:36.309 --> 12:37.976
it'll cause feedback and
reveal that you're wired.

12:37.976 --> 12:39.776
- You really want to do this?
- Yeah.

12:39.776 --> 12:41.843
Your job will be to deliver
medical help to the hostage.

12:41.843 --> 12:44.243
Anything else is just a bonus.
You're to get in and get out.

12:44.243 --> 12:46.510
You are not to risk your own life,
and whatever you believe...

12:46.510 --> 12:49.644
Don't jump into his delusion.
I can't negotiate with him
if he thinks I believe him.

12:49.644 --> 12:50.744
Right.

12:51.377 --> 12:54.577
This is Agent Janus. He's a trained
medic. He'll work on the hostage.

12:54.711 --> 12:56.411
You're to keep
Duane Barry talking.

12:56.411 --> 12:59.811
Like I said, if he's talking, he's not
gonna shoot anybody, including you.

13:01.078 --> 13:03.078
Now, I've got
three snipers out there.

13:03.078 --> 13:05.412
Anything you can do
to get him to the front door...

13:05.412 --> 13:08.012
All we need is one shot
to the medulla oblongata.

13:11.746 --> 13:14.713
Tac Command, this is
roof top here. I have them in sight.

13:14.713 --> 13:17.146
They're passing the fountain and
approaching the front entrance now.

13:25.014 --> 13:27.914
-Just unlock the door.
Move back.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.948
- Duane?
- Hands in the air.

13:37.348 --> 13:39.982
- Put the kit on the floor slowly.
- We're unarmed.

13:41.182 --> 13:43.849
- We just want to help the injured.
- Over here.

13:45.716 --> 13:47.649
Face the door!
That's right.

13:54.450 --> 13:56.817
Not armed, huh?
You're F.B.I., aren't ya?

13:57.484 --> 13:59.417
- Got a gun in the kit?
- No.

14:00.017 --> 14:01.984
- Are you wearin' a wire?
- No.

14:02.018 --> 14:03.718
We're just here
to help.

14:06.685 --> 14:09.518
- Okay.
- Nobody's
gonna try anything, Duane.

14:10.018 --> 14:12.185
That's right. Good.
You want to work with him.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.419
Just want to make sure
no one else gets hurt.

14:14.419 --> 14:16.619
Just do your business and get out.

14:24.886 --> 14:26.853
- How's he doin'?
- He's bad.

14:28.087 --> 14:31.387
Hi, my name is Janus. I'm a paramedic.
Hold on. I'm gonna take care of you.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.654
They want to work
with you, Duane.

14:33.854 --> 14:36.654
But you gotta work with them.
Why not let the others go?

14:36.888 --> 14:39.421
- Doc's goin' with me.
- Then let the women go.

14:42.588 --> 14:44.222
Were they here, Duane?

14:44.622 --> 14:46.489
The light?
Was that them?

14:47.655 --> 14:50.256
- Don't try and B.S. Duane Barry.
- We lost time.

14:51.156 --> 14:53.489
I checked my watch.
Isn't that what happens? Time stops?

14:53.489 --> 14:54.723
Isn't it?

14:56.556 --> 14:57.690
Duane?

15:25.593 --> 15:28.993
- You're makin' it up.
- Isn't that what they've
been saying to you, Duane?

15:28.993 --> 15:31.927
- That you're making it up?
- They say it's inside my head.

15:32.293 --> 15:33.993
All they want to do
is just give me more drugs.

15:33.993 --> 15:36.760
- I hear you, Duane.
- You hear me 'cause I got a gun.

15:36.827 --> 15:38.594
No.
I believe your story.

15:38.794 --> 15:41.994
- No, you're feeding into his psychosis.
- You're afraid.

15:42.528 --> 15:44.728
I know the pain and
the fear you must feel.

15:44.728 --> 15:47.328
Just listen to me.
Don't try to identify with him.

15:47.628 --> 15:51.162
I've talked to people, Duane,
people just like you who
nobody wanted to believe.

15:53.895 --> 15:56.629
This man's gonna die
unless we get him to a hospital.

15:56.829 --> 15:58.829
Why don't you
let him go, Duane?

16:00.463 --> 16:02.663
There's no reason
this man has to die.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.963
Come on, Duane.
You've got the power. Let him go.

16:08.597 --> 16:09.664
Okay.

16:10.330 --> 16:12.364
Good. You
made the right choice.

16:13.664 --> 16:15.464
Now, we're just gonna move him
carefully to the door.

16:15.464 --> 16:16.964
No! Baldie cango.

16:18.831 --> 16:20.131
But you stay.

16:21.365 --> 16:23.398
I'm tradin' the bald man
for you.

16:24.198 --> 16:25.399
Damn it!

16:25.465 --> 16:27.999
- Coming out!
- Let's get him!

16:29.666 --> 16:32.199
You're going to be all right, sir.
Keep moving.

16:36.833 --> 16:39.000
Now let's see
how good a liar you are.

16:39.267 --> 16:41.167
I'm tellin'
the truth, Duane.

16:41.867 --> 16:44.734
How could you ever know what
Duane Barry's been through?

16:46.901 --> 16:48.568
How could anyone know?

16:49.834 --> 16:51.601
It happened
to my sister.

16:56.835 --> 16:59.302
Don't you think you can
lie to save their lives.

16:59.369 --> 17:01.002
I want
some honesty!

17:01.669 --> 17:03.836
- I want some respect!

17:08.435 --> 17:10.236
I'm tired
of all the B.S.!

17:11.036 --> 17:13.637
How does it happen, Duane?
Driving in your car?

17:14.069 --> 17:15.737
Alone in bed at night?

17:15.970 --> 17:18.737
When do they come to you?
You're paralyzed, aren't you?

17:20.003 --> 17:22.438
Unable to move.
Sometimes you can't even breathe.

17:23.871 --> 17:26.605
You feel an electric shock go through
your body, and then they're there.

17:26.605 --> 17:28.605
He's gonna push him
right over the edge.

17:28.605 --> 17:31.772
- I need a clear picture
of what's going on in there.
- Right away.

17:33.872 --> 17:36.472
You're choosing a dangerous course,
Agent Mulder.

17:36.472 --> 17:38.606
There are beings,
aren't there, Duane?

17:38.606 --> 17:41.239
-Are they tall? Or small? Diminutive?
-No! No!

17:46.173 --> 17:48.307
- They take you, Duane.

17:48.374 --> 17:50.307
- Against your will.
- He's gonna kill us.

17:50.307 --> 17:52.907
You're powerless.
Sometimes you can't even speak.

17:53.541 --> 17:55.808
It's always the same.
Nobody can help you.

17:55.974 --> 17:58.408
- Where do they take you, Duane?

17:58.808 --> 18:01.375
Is there a ship?
Do they take you to a ship, Duane?

18:02.775 --> 18:05.709
How do you get there? Are you
conscious of being transported?

18:25.644 --> 18:27.377
They're, uh...

18:29.111 --> 18:31.078
They're talkin'
to Duane Barry.

18:33.811 --> 18:35.412
But they don't speak.

18:37.745 --> 18:39.745
He can hear
what they're sayin'.

18:41.545 --> 18:43.346
They can...
read his mind.

18:45.213 --> 18:47.713
That's right.
Abductees call it "Mindscan."

18:48.113 --> 18:49.846
It's a kind of telepathy.

18:52.013 --> 18:54.147
I'm tellin' 'em
I don't want to go.

18:55.347 --> 18:56.947
But they never listen.

18:58.281 --> 19:00.047
They know what I'm sayin'.

19:03.181 --> 19:04.581
But they just...

19:06.048 --> 19:08.115
go right on
about their business.

19:15.049 --> 19:17.016
Tell him what
that business is.

19:20.249 --> 19:21.449
Tell him.

19:23.316 --> 19:25.950
They take you aboard the ship
to perform the tests.

19:32.117 --> 19:33.884
They... drilled my teeth.

19:35.751 --> 19:37.951
They drilled holes
in my damn teeth!

20:27.923 --> 20:29.690
- Yeah.
- That's what I wanted
to show you in here.

20:29.690 --> 20:31.923
Who here can talk
to an Agent Scully?

20:34.623 --> 20:37.324
- Agent Scully, it's Alex Krycek.
- Where's Mulder?

20:37.457 --> 20:40.191
- He traded himself
for one of the hostages.
- What?

20:40.791 --> 20:42.424
He's in
with Duane Barry.

20:42.424 --> 20:44.758
- You've got to get him out of there.
- They're working on it.

20:44.758 --> 20:47.191
No, you've got to get him out of there
now, or he's going to be killed.

20:47.191 --> 20:50.758
- How can you be sure?
- Because Duane Barry is not
what Mulder thinks he is.

20:58.026 --> 21:00.426
How old was your sister
when they took her?

21:01.226 --> 21:02.626
She was eight.

21:03.660 --> 21:05.760
I seen kids sometimes.
Young girls.

21:07.393 --> 21:09.860
- What are they doing to them?
- Doin' tests.

21:11.260 --> 21:12.927
You know,
testin' 'em.

21:21.028 --> 21:22.762
They tell 'em not to cry.

21:23.528 --> 21:25.195
Are they hurting them?

21:26.562 --> 21:27.762
Oh, yeah.

21:29.329 --> 21:31.596
Sometimes...
Sometimes it hurts real bad.

21:33.896 --> 21:35.996
And... you just want to die,
you know?

21:38.897 --> 21:40.830
You know
what it's like, sir?

21:42.664 --> 21:45.031
It's like livin'
with a gun to your head...

21:45.097 --> 21:47.431
and never knowin'
when it's gonna go off.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.464
You can
let the others go, Duane.

21:52.231 --> 21:53.831
Let the others go,
and take me.

21:53.831 --> 21:56.432
Oh, they heard you talkin' like that,

21:57.332 --> 21:59.532
they gonna have your ass.

22:00.432 --> 22:02.432
I don't care
about that, Duane.

22:04.199 --> 22:06.133
No, I wouldn't
do that to you.

22:08.733 --> 22:10.966
Besides, Doc and I
got an appointment.

22:11.033 --> 22:12.700
Ain't that right, Doc?

22:29.235 --> 22:30.668
We got a picture.

22:30.835 --> 22:32.569
Mulder's here,
opposite the doctor.

22:32.569 --> 22:34.202
The women are on the north wall.
We can't see the east wall.

22:34.202 --> 22:35.936
- Duane Barry must be there.
- Hold on a second.

22:35.936 --> 22:37.902
No. I don't think you understand
what I'm telling you.

22:37.902 --> 22:39.903
- I just flew down here from Washington.
- We've got a situation in progress.

22:39.903 --> 22:42.003
- All right. Well, then let me
talk to someone who's in charge.
- You are.

22:42.003 --> 22:43.936
- Calm down, Scully.
- Don't tell me to calm down.
I'm not going to calm down...

22:43.936 --> 22:46.370
until I can talk to someone
who will listen to what I'm saying.

22:46.370 --> 22:49.304
- What's the problem here?
- I'm Special Agent Dana Scully,

22:49.337 --> 22:51.470
and I have information that
is vital to your negotiations.

22:51.470 --> 22:54.971
- What information?
- I think there has been
a critical misjudgment here.

22:55.004 --> 22:57.338
This man who claims to be
under the control of aliens,

22:57.338 --> 23:00.338
his mental health history
describes a rare state of psychosis.

23:00.605 --> 23:02.872
As you can see
from his medical records,

23:03.172 --> 23:05.472
in 1982 Duane Barry
was shot in the line of duty,

23:05.472 --> 23:08.439
- the bullet piercing
his bilateral frontal lobes.
- Right.

23:08.439 --> 23:11.472
The injury left him nearly incapable
of functioning in society.

23:11.939 --> 23:14.273
It effectively destroyed
the moral center of his brain.

23:14.273 --> 23:17.040
Now, almost a hundred years
ago, there was a framous case.

23:17.440 --> 23:19.773
A man named Gage had a blasting rod
pierce the same region.

23:19.773 --> 23:22.940
- And what effect did it have?
- He became a pathological liar...

23:23.340 --> 23:25.007
suffering
from severe delusions.

23:25.007 --> 23:27.741
His behavior was characterized
as bizarre and violent,

23:28.274 --> 23:30.574
with a tendency
to act out his fantasies.

23:31.875 --> 23:34.141
How did you get involved
in this case?

23:34.441 --> 23:36.842
Agent Mulder called me.
We used to work together.

23:36.842 --> 23:40.109
Well, if this is true, he's got
Your former partner completely fooled.

23:41.576 --> 23:44.342
Is there a way I can reach him
with this information?

23:47.876 --> 23:50.210
The government knows
about it, you know?

23:50.476 --> 23:53.910
They're even in on it sometimes...
right there in your room when they come.

23:54.143 --> 23:55.710
They work together...

23:56.944 --> 23:58.911
with a, uh,
secret corporation.

24:06.211 --> 24:07.878
Who in the government?

24:07.878 --> 24:10.312
A man, military...
They're all in it together.

24:11.178 --> 24:13.945
The government knows why they're here.

24:15.612 --> 24:18.546
But they wouldn't dare
let the truth out, so they cooperate.

24:19.779 --> 24:22.780
You're going to have to deal
with resolving this situation, Duane,

24:22.780 --> 24:24.213
sooner or later.

24:24.546 --> 24:25.813
I'm tired.

24:27.247 --> 24:28.980
There's
no other way out.

24:29.247 --> 24:31.647
You've got to tell them
what you want to do.

24:32.214 --> 24:34.981
- I just want
to go back to the place.
- What place?

24:35.648 --> 24:37.814
Where it first started.
Where they first came and got me.

24:37.814 --> 24:39.248
Where is that?

24:42.148 --> 24:43.415
A mountain.

24:44.215 --> 24:46.015
We went, uh,
up and... up.

24:49.349 --> 24:51.482
Ascending...
Ascending to the stars.

24:54.616 --> 24:56.183
I'm not goin' again.

24:58.283 --> 24:59.150
- Mulder, it's me.

24:59.150 --> 25:01.150
- Mulder, it's me.

25:02.350 --> 25:04.750
Listen to me.
You cannot trust Duane Barry.

25:05.017 --> 25:07.784
He is a brain-damaged psychopath
who took a bullet in the head.

25:07.784 --> 25:10.018
- He is not what you think he is.
- What?

25:11.318 --> 25:13.885
- How do they find you each time?
- Implants...

25:15.852 --> 25:17.485
my gums, sinus cavity,

25:18.985 --> 25:20.685
here in my belly button.

25:21.052 --> 25:23.786
- Trackin' devices.
- Mulder, he could snap at any time.

25:26.519 --> 25:28.953
Now, you have to work
towards resolving this.

25:29.153 --> 25:32.253
Now, you have his trust.
You have to try and negotiate with him.

25:34.287 --> 25:36.320
Why not let
the women go, Duane?

25:36.687 --> 25:39.787
- They'll deal with you
if you let the women go.
- That's good.

25:39.787 --> 25:42.121
That's good, Mulder.
Now, keep him talking.

25:42.121 --> 25:45.588
H.R.T. is moving into position,
and unless you can get him
to free the hostages,

25:45.588 --> 25:47.921
they are going
to execute a tactical plan.

25:49.222 --> 25:51.789
The women are of no consequence
to you. Let 'em go.

25:53.455 --> 25:55.522
It's the right thing
to do, Duane.

25:57.489 --> 25:59.023
Okay, but he stays.

26:06.557 --> 26:08.257
Go on.
Get out of here.

26:09.157 --> 26:11.357
Get up. Go on.
Get out of here. Go on.

26:17.424 --> 26:20.358
I...
I just want to say that I believe you.

26:33.493 --> 26:35.326
- We're safe now.
- Uh-huh.

26:35.460 --> 26:38.360
- The women are clear.
- I got him. Standing, center room.

26:40.160 --> 26:42.027
- Moving...

26:45.127 --> 26:47.761
This is a countdown, Mulder.
They're coming at you.

26:52.661 --> 26:54.561
- Position one, ready.
- Coming at you, number one.

26:54.561 --> 26:57.595
- Gonna need transportation.
- What do you want, Duane? A car?

26:59.662 --> 27:02.296
- I don't know.
- Do you know where you want to go?

27:04.262 --> 27:05.863
They're gonna tell me.

27:05.863 --> 27:08.996
Duane, you can't leave here if you
don't know where you want to go.

27:10.230 --> 27:11.930
- Duane! Come here.
- What?

27:11.930 --> 27:14.030
Hold your fire.
You lost your line.

27:15.764 --> 27:16.797
Uh...

27:18.064 --> 27:20.531
- There's something I want to ask you.
- What?

27:22.531 --> 27:24.164
You didn't believe me.

27:24.965 --> 27:26.731
I had to earn your trust.

27:27.165 --> 27:29.232
Now, there's something
I gotta know.

27:29.232 --> 27:31.132
Are you making
any of this up?

27:38.966 --> 27:40.133
You, uh,

27:41.066 --> 27:43.100
callin' Duane Barry
a liar now?

27:45.167 --> 27:46.200
No.

27:46.800 --> 27:48.767
You think
I made that all up?

27:50.100 --> 27:51.801
No, I don't.
I'm sorry.

27:52.001 --> 27:55.068
- You're sorry?
- Duane, will you listen to me
for a second?

27:56.401 --> 27:58.901
- You're just like all the others.
You say you believe me.
- Duane...

27:58.901 --> 28:00.435
- I do believe you. I believe you.
- But you don't.

28:00.435 --> 28:02.468
- You lie,
just like everybody else!
- No, I believe you, Duane!

28:06.169 --> 28:08.669
I trusted you! I trusted you!
I was a fool!

28:09.369 --> 28:12.003
Can I say something?
Duane, can I say something?

28:12.003 --> 28:15.136
I know you're tired. But there's
something you've forgotten to do.

28:16.236 --> 28:19.070
When you let the women leave,
You left the door unlocked.

28:20.237 --> 28:22.137
Go and lock
the door, Duane.

28:22.270 --> 28:24.604
Go lock the door.
Go lock the door, Duane.

28:25.237 --> 28:26.537
Go lock it.

28:28.171 --> 28:30.404
They can get in here.
Go lock the door.

28:47.439 --> 28:49.873
- Okay, let's move!

28:50.606 --> 28:52.973
- Agent Mulder.
- He's down! He's down!

29:08.075 --> 29:09.908
1400 block South Parker, code 3.

29:09.908 --> 29:11.642
Repeat. Rolling code 3...

29:11.742 --> 29:14.475
- Medical unit 2-0, we're rolling.

29:22.710 --> 29:24.243
You okay, Mulder?

29:24.310 --> 29:25.377
Yeah.

29:28.077 --> 29:30.644
Whatever you're feeling,
You did the right thing.

29:32.711 --> 29:34.444
Yeah,
it's just that, uh,

29:34.577 --> 29:36.011
I believed him.

29:38.578 --> 29:40.245
Sometimes when you want
to believe so badly,

29:40.245 --> 29:42.245
You end up...
looking too hard.

29:52.813 --> 29:54.846
Agent Mulder,
thanks for coming.

29:55.746 --> 29:59.080
- No, I was surprised
to get your call.
- Yeah, well, as it turned out,

29:59.213 --> 30:01.213
whatever your impression
of the way it was handled,

30:01.213 --> 30:04.547
I didn't get to thank you for going
out there and putting it on the line.

30:05.047 --> 30:06.147
What?

30:06.647 --> 30:09.748
I don't know. I guess I thought
You called me down here to chew me out.

30:09.748 --> 30:11.481
- Oh.
- How's he doing?

30:11.581 --> 30:14.115
Duane? They almost lost him,
but he stabilized.

30:14.548 --> 30:16.848
They've got him listed
on critical still.

30:25.383 --> 30:27.583
I checked on his record
with the Bureau.

30:27.616 --> 30:29.083
It was exemplary.

30:29.250 --> 30:31.517
His accident
was something of a mystery.

30:31.517 --> 30:34.683
Shot by his own weapon in a drug
stakeout, left for dead in the woods.

30:34.683 --> 30:37.550
He was never the same.
Lost everything... wife, kids, house.

30:37.684 --> 30:39.517
The fine thread
of sanity.

30:42.384 --> 30:45.485
I actually called you down here
for another reason, Agent Mulder.

30:46.751 --> 30:47.785
Uh...

30:50.385 --> 30:53.285
In the X rays, the surgeon
found several pieces of metal...

30:54.552 --> 30:57.486
in his gums, in his sinus cavity...
and one in the abdomen.

30:59.186 --> 31:01.620
I had them checked.
I felt you'd want to know.

31:02.320 --> 31:04.320
And there were
tiny drill holes...

31:04.320 --> 31:06.387
in his left and
right rear molars.

31:06.720 --> 31:09.254
A dentist who examined them said
they could not have been done...

31:09.254 --> 31:11.554
with any of the current
equipment in use...

31:11.621 --> 31:13.987
not without chipping
or damaging the tooth.

31:13.987 --> 31:16.088
Anyway, I thought
you ought to know.

31:31.789 --> 31:33.556
This could
just be a piece of shrapnel.

31:33.556 --> 31:35.390
Duane Barry
did a tour of duty in Vietnam.

31:35.390 --> 31:37.723
It was right where he said
it would be, Scully,

31:37.723 --> 31:39.990
along with the ones
in his gums and his sinus.

31:39.990 --> 31:42.024
And you think that
this was implanted?

31:42.024 --> 31:45.157
Well, if it was, that would mean
Duane Barry was telling the truth.

31:46.357 --> 31:48.224
Or some version
of the truth.

31:54.058 --> 31:56.325
Look, I'll take this down
to ballistics.

31:56.358 --> 31:58.625
We can have this
cleared up in a second.

32:09.693 --> 32:11.693
Let me just make
as light adjustment.

32:16.260 --> 32:17.794
What do you think?

32:18.361 --> 32:21.127
Could be a shell casing or
a small artillery fragment.

32:21.594 --> 32:23.861
The edges are dull, but it could've
been white-hot when it entered the body.

32:23.861 --> 32:25.495
That would make sense.

32:25.995 --> 32:27.861
- But look at this.
- What?

32:28.428 --> 32:30.595
These small markings.
See them here?

32:30.662 --> 32:32.762
Mm. Looks like
some kind of a stamp.

32:33.862 --> 32:36.662
Like it's been tooled or etched.
Pretty fine work too.

32:37.062 --> 32:39.696
This square we're looking at
is only ten microns across.

32:39.696 --> 32:40.896
Strange.

32:57.731 --> 33:00.031
- 11.14.

33:09.299 --> 33:10.499
Thank you.

33:16.300 --> 33:19.233
- Can I get some help here?
- I'll be right with you.

33:19.967 --> 33:21.567
...cash out my drawer.

33:36.335 --> 33:38.902
- What happened?
Did you touch something?
- Uh...

33:38.969 --> 33:41.902
- I don't know what happened.

34:38.275 --> 34:40.041
- All right.

34:50.809 --> 34:52.876
Hello. This is Fox Mulder.

34:52.876 --> 34:55.710
- Leave a message, please.
- Mulder, it's me.

34:55.842 --> 34:58.377
I just had something
incredibly strange happen.

34:58.577 --> 35:02.144
This piece of metal
that they took out of Duane Barry,
it has some kind of code on it.

35:02.144 --> 35:04.944
I ran it through a scanner, and
some kind of a serial number came up.

35:04.944 --> 35:07.777
What the hell is this thing,
Mulder? It's almost as if...

35:09.678 --> 35:12.945
- It's almost as if somebody
was using it to catalog him.

35:23.012 --> 35:24.746
- Come on!

35:24.746 --> 35:27.779
Mulder! I need your help!
- Come on!

35:28.046 --> 35:29.213
Mulder!

35:34.313 --> 35:35.447
Mulder!

35:35.448 --> 35:36.448
