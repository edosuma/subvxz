02:09:07.345 --> 02:09:09.871
<i>Isaac: I understand.
I understand.</i>

02:09:09.948 --> 02:09:13.885
<i>I want to be kept posted
throughout the day and night.</i>

02:09:13.952 --> 02:09:16.649
They're called
Quo Vadimus.

02:09:16.722 --> 02:09:17.814
<i>Que Vazhmus'?</i>

02:09:17.889 --> 02:09:18.822
Yeah.

02:09:18.890 --> 02:09:20.187
Where did they come from?

02:09:20.258 --> 02:09:23.159
They put in a stock offering
this morning at 6:00 A.M.

02:09:23.228 --> 02:09:24.423
-- From out of nowhere?
-- Yeah.

02:09:24.496 --> 02:09:25.895
From out of
the clear blue sky?

02:09:25.964 --> 02:09:27.523
That's where things
come from.

02:09:27.599 --> 02:09:29.658
-- What about MDI?
-- They're still in it.

02:09:29.735 --> 02:09:31.464
MDI was our hope, Isaac.

02:09:31.536 --> 02:09:32.799
They're still in it.

02:09:32.871 --> 02:09:34.202
We want MDI.

02:09:34.272 --> 02:09:35.603
They're still in it.

02:09:35.674 --> 02:09:38.871
But now these other guys
come along -- Platypus.

02:09:38.944 --> 02:09:39.911
<i>Que Vachmus.</i>

02:09:39.978 --> 02:09:41.309
What do we know about them?

02:09:41.379 --> 02:09:43.347
We're getting information.
In the meantime --

02:09:43.415 --> 02:09:44.348
I won't say anything.

02:09:44.416 --> 02:09:45.577
-- Dana...
-- I won't say anything.

02:09:45.650 --> 02:09:47.140
-- <i>You say that in here.</i>
-- <i>Isaac...</i>

02:09:47.219 --> 02:09:49.244
<i>You say that in here,
but then you go out there</i> --

02:09:49.321 --> 02:09:51.551
-- When have I done that?
-- Every day you've been here.

02:09:51.623 --> 02:09:53.250
I can't believe you've
been keeping track.

02:09:53.325 --> 02:09:55.589
We'll know something
by the end of the day.

02:09:55.660 --> 02:09:57.389
Don't start a brushfire.

02:09:57.462 --> 02:09:58.896
People can change, Isaac.

02:09:58.964 --> 02:10:01.092
I have incredible capacity
for growth.

02:10:01.166 --> 02:10:02.190
Excellent.

02:10:05.103 --> 02:10:06.366
It's called Quo Vadimus.

02:10:06.438 --> 02:10:08.202
And they put in a bid?

02:10:08.273 --> 02:10:09.536
At 6:00 this morning.

02:10:09.608 --> 02:10:11.542
-- What about MDI?
-- They're still in it.

02:10:11.610 --> 02:10:12.873
<i>-- Qua Vachmus'?
-- Yeah.</i>

02:10:12.944 --> 02:10:14.378
-- Who are they?
-- We don't know.

02:10:14.446 --> 02:10:15.845
-- What do they do?
-- We don't know.

02:10:15.914 --> 02:10:18.178
-- Do they want the cable company?
-- We don't know.

02:10:18.250 --> 02:10:20.480
-- MDI wanted the cable company.
-- MDl's still in it.

02:10:20.552 --> 02:10:21.917
-- So it's a bidding war...
-- Yeah.

02:10:21.987 --> 02:10:23.853
Between a company
that wants to keep us

02:10:23.922 --> 02:10:26.152
-- and a company that who
the hell knows? -- Yeah.

02:10:26.224 --> 02:10:27.692
What does it sound
like they do?

02:10:27.759 --> 02:10:28.749
<i>-- Qua Vachmus'?
-- Yeah.</i>

02:10:28.827 --> 02:10:30.727
It sounds like they're
the official airline

02:10:30.796 --> 02:10:32.389
of the Holy Roman Empire.

02:10:32.464 --> 02:10:34.796
-- VVell, they're probably not that.
Can't make any money doing that. -- No.

02:10:34.866 --> 02:10:36.732
Listen, Isaac asked me
to keep this quiet.

02:10:36.802 --> 02:10:38.793
So if you could do me
a favor and just keep --

02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:40.565
Yeah. Kim, Elliot,
get everything you can

02:10:40.639 --> 02:10:42.232
on a company
called Quo Vadimus.

02:10:42.307 --> 02:10:44.901
-- [ Sighs deeply] -- They put
in a bid for Continental Corp.

02:10:44.976 --> 02:10:46.239
Okay, thank you.

02:10:46.311 --> 02:10:48.075
See you at the rundown.

02:10:48.146 --> 02:10:50.080
<i>Casey, I can't
possibly concentrate.</i>

02:10:50.148 --> 02:10:52.583
-- Danny... -- No human being
could be expected to concentrate

02:10:52.651 --> 02:10:54.585
under these kinds
of circumstances.

02:10:54.653 --> 02:10:55.677
What happened?

02:10:55.754 --> 02:10:56.846
Rebecca sent him flowers.

02:10:56.922 --> 02:10:57.855
Bitch.

02:10:57.923 --> 02:10:59.186
That's right.

02:10:59.257 --> 02:11:00.486
-- Danny... -- That's who
the flowers are from?

02:11:00.559 --> 02:11:02.084
That's who the flowers are
from with a card signed "R.W."

02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:04.026
And you're sure they're not
from Robert Wagner?

02:11:04.095 --> 02:11:06.587
<i>Casey:</i> Can we get <i>to</i> work? -- Very sure.
VValks out of my life a year ago,

02:11:06.665 --> 02:11:08.963
she walks back in with cards and a
flower, and, Casey, I ask you...

02:11:09.034 --> 02:11:10.763
How can you be expected
to concentrate?

02:11:10.836 --> 02:11:12.497
How can I be expected
to concentrate?

02:11:12.571 --> 02:11:14.005
Why don't you
get it over with?

02:11:14.072 --> 02:11:15.938
-- What do you mean?
-- Why don't you call her?

02:11:16.007 --> 02:11:16.940
-- Call her?
-- Yeah.

02:11:17.008 --> 02:11:17.736
I'm not calling her.

02:11:17.809 --> 02:11:19.277
Okay, let's get to work.

02:11:19.344 --> 02:11:21.335
There's no way
I'm calling her.

02:11:21.413 --> 02:11:23.973
-- <i>L/VeH, you seem pretty resolute.</i>
-- I <i>am.</i>

02:11:24.049 --> 02:11:26.017
-- Okay, then let's work. -- I
couldn't call her if I wanted to.

02:11:26.084 --> 02:11:27.108
-- Why not?
-- She got a new phone number.

02:11:27.185 --> 02:11:29.051
-- How <i>do</i> you <i>know?</i>
-- I tried calling her.

02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:30.349
<i>-- He'!-
-- He'!-</i>

02:11:30.422 --> 02:11:32.481
There's a new bidder
for Continental Corp.

02:11:32.557 --> 02:11:34.525
-- Who? -- I'm not saying
anything more than that.

02:11:34.593 --> 02:11:36.357
Why not?

02:11:36.428 --> 02:11:39.295
'Cause Isaac doesn't trust that when
he tells me something I can be cool.

02:11:39.364 --> 02:11:42.356
He thinks it's gonna spread around, and
the information will get all twisted.

02:11:42.434 --> 02:11:43.833
And I'm gonna
show him he's wrong.

02:11:43.902 --> 02:11:45.165
3...2...1...

02:11:45.237 --> 02:11:47.171
<i>Isaac, I don't know
if you heard</i> --

02:11:47.239 --> 02:11:49.173
at 6:00 this morning
there was a bid

02:11:49.241 --> 02:11:51.175
from an Italian airline
called Platypus.

02:11:51.243 --> 02:11:53.940
Yeah. Keep it
under your hat, would you?

02:11:54.012 --> 02:11:55.502
You bet.

02:12:03.221 --> 02:12:04.655
<i>Jeremy:
It's a holding company.</i>

02:12:04.723 --> 02:12:05.918
<i>Dana: Tell me.</i>

02:12:05.991 --> 02:12:08.255
In the early '90s,
a guy named Calvin Trager

02:12:08.326 --> 02:12:10.260
perfected something called
the hard-disk controller.

02:12:10.328 --> 02:12:12.262
Say this next part
so I understand it.

02:12:12.330 --> 02:12:14.321
[Chuckles] Hard disks
used to be very big.

02:12:14.399 --> 02:12:16.527
He made it so that
they're very small.

02:12:16.601 --> 02:12:17.762
Okay.

02:12:17.836 --> 02:12:19.668
Trager realized
the astronomical potential

02:12:19.738 --> 02:12:22.105
for the technology and formed
a company to sell it.

02:12:22.173 --> 02:12:24.232
He made $100 million
by the time he was 25,

02:12:24.309 --> 02:12:25.572
then he started
buying companies.

02:12:25.677 --> 02:12:26.769
What companies?

02:12:26.845 --> 02:12:29.815
Lofton Chemical, DataTech,
Evergreen Systems Group.

02:12:29.881 --> 02:12:32.043
Six months ago, he formed an
umbrella company for all three.

02:12:32.117 --> 02:12:33.448
-- Quo Vadimus.
-- Yeah.

02:12:33.518 --> 02:12:35.418
Do they want
a cable channel?

02:12:35.487 --> 02:12:38.081
VVell, Dana, a company like that --
their interest in the cable channel

02:12:38.156 --> 02:12:39.453
isn't gonna
be the programming.

02:12:39.524 --> 02:12:41.424
It's the coaxial cable
with the wider bandwidth.

02:12:41.493 --> 02:12:43.359
Yeah. How did you
know that?

02:12:43.428 --> 02:12:45.692
I met a guy
at Anthony's last night --

02:12:45.764 --> 02:12:47.528
Actually, I saw him
the night before, too.

02:12:47.599 --> 02:12:49.693
He guessed Time Warner
was gonna pull out

02:12:49.768 --> 02:12:53.033
at $27 a share
and predicted MDl-Transcom.

02:12:53.104 --> 02:12:55.539
And he also explained
why somebody would buy

02:12:55.607 --> 02:12:58.304
a cable company
and dump the programming.

02:12:58.376 --> 02:13:00.310
Do we think that's what's gonna
happen if it goes to them?

02:13:00.378 --> 02:13:02.437
Well, these guys have a
track record of stripping.

02:13:02.514 --> 02:13:06.314
-- In public? - It means gutting a
company and selling off its assets.

02:13:06.384 --> 02:13:10.218
[ Stomps foot ] I knew coaxial cable, all
right? I'd like a little credit for that.

02:13:10.288 --> 02:13:11.813
I gave you a lot
of credit for that.

02:13:11.890 --> 02:13:15.224
-- Why are you carrying the carton around?
-- I'm settling my affairs.

02:13:15.293 --> 02:13:16.954
What affairs?

02:13:17.028 --> 02:13:19.224
My affairs, whatever we mean by that
when we say it. I have affairs.

02:13:19.297 --> 02:13:20.662
And you're settling them?

02:13:20.732 --> 02:13:22.666
Yes. Last year,
I went into your office.

02:13:22.734 --> 02:13:25.499
You weren't there, a pack
of Juicy Fruit on the desk.

02:13:25.570 --> 02:13:27.664
I look around, walk out
with the Juicy Fruit.

02:13:27.739 --> 02:13:29.173
Why are you
telling me this now?

02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:30.708
I'm settling my affairs.

02:13:30.775 --> 02:13:33.301
Okay. I'm going to lunch.

02:13:33.378 --> 02:13:36.279
VVould you ask Dan and Casey what it's
gonna take for me to read some draft copy?

02:13:38.183 --> 02:13:39.480
-- Kim...
-- Yeah?

02:13:39.551 --> 02:13:42.418
-- 7-minute ab video.
-- Thank you.

02:13:42.487 --> 02:13:45.388
Dana wants to know what it's gonna
take for her to see some draft copy.

02:13:45.457 --> 02:13:47.391
-- It's gonna take us writing it.
-- Okay.

02:13:47.459 --> 02:13:49.393
By the way, it turns out
it's a holding company

02:13:49.461 --> 02:13:50.895
called Quo Vadimus,

02:13:50.962 --> 02:13:53.226
not an Italian airline
called Platypus.

02:13:53.298 --> 02:13:54.561
Yes.

02:13:54.632 --> 02:13:55.724
<i>All right.</i>

02:13:55.800 --> 02:13:57.029
Yes.

02:13:57.102 --> 02:13:58.467
-- We're gonna sit here...
-- Yes.

02:13:58.536 --> 02:13:59.970
-- And we're gonna do this.
-- Yes.

02:14:00.038 --> 02:14:01.836
-- We're gonna write this...
-- 'Cause that's what we do.

02:14:01.906 --> 02:14:03.704
-- We're writers.
-- We're doers.

02:14:03.775 --> 02:14:06.210
-- Yes.
-- Okay. [Sighs]

02:14:10.348 --> 02:14:12.009

I don't believe this.

-- This is pretty weird.
-- Yeah.

02:14:54.559 --> 02:14:56.960
I mean, I don't know if
I'm comfortable with this.

02:14:57.028 --> 02:14:59.087
With what?

02:14:59.164 --> 02:15:01.132
Every time I've come in here
in the last three days,

02:15:01.199 --> 02:15:03.224
you've been in here, so I'm saying
I'm not comfortable with it.

02:15:03.301 --> 02:15:07.329
You've been here every time I've been in here in
the last three days, yet I remain unconcerned.

02:15:07.405 --> 02:15:09.635
What is your story?

02:15:09.707 --> 02:15:11.038
My story?

02:15:11.109 --> 02:15:14.443
Yes, you're this strange
person in my life right now.

02:15:14.512 --> 02:15:16.606
I was born in Ely, Minnesota,

02:15:16.681 --> 02:15:20.015
very close to the
Boundary Waters canoe area.

02:15:20.085 --> 02:15:21.985
What do you do for a living?

02:15:22.053 --> 02:15:23.543
I own my own business.

02:15:23.621 --> 02:15:25.715
-- And you don't live in New York?
-- I think I mentioned --

02:15:25.790 --> 02:15:28.725
Yes, you live
in Paris and Seattle

02:15:28.793 --> 02:15:30.727
and Chicago and Tokyo
and St. Barts.

02:15:30.795 --> 02:15:32.889
To be perfectly honest
with you,

02:15:32.964 --> 02:15:35.433
I think I may have sold
the place in St. Barts.

02:15:35.500 --> 02:15:37.628
I can't remember now.

02:15:39.704 --> 02:15:42.469
What book are you reading?

02:15:42.540 --> 02:15:45.805
It's the new biography
of Lyndon Johnson.

02:15:45.877 --> 02:15:49.836
So, you decided to sell
the place in St. Barts

02:15:49.914 --> 02:15:52.508
and live...in this bar?

02:15:52.584 --> 02:15:55.212
You don't really want
to talk about me, do you?

02:15:55.286 --> 02:15:56.276
What do you mean?

02:15:56.354 --> 02:15:58.118
You seem pretty down.

you don't even --

02:16:00.558 --> 02:16:02.322
You're drinking alone
at 5:00 in the afternoon.

02:16:02.393 --> 02:16:03.883
I'm having a glass of wine
with lunch.

02:16:03.962 --> 02:16:05.487
I work
from noon to midnight.

02:16:05.563 --> 02:16:08.157
5:00 is my lunch hour,
and I'm here alone

02:16:08.233 --> 02:16:10.429
because I'm reading a book.

02:16:10.502 --> 02:16:11.992
No, you're not.

02:16:12.070 --> 02:16:14.937
-- What are you -- -- You had to look
at the cover to tell me what it was.

02:16:15.006 --> 02:16:17.771
You're here,
you're alone,

02:16:17.842 --> 02:16:20.174
you're having a drink.

02:16:20.245 --> 02:16:22.839
Yes.

02:16:24.782 --> 02:16:29.276
[Sighs] MDI-Transcom came in
the way you said it would.

02:16:29.354 --> 02:16:30.913
I know.

02:16:30.989 --> 02:16:33.253
Another bidder came in
this morning.

02:16:33.324 --> 02:16:36.385
If they get it, that's
pretty much the ballgame.

02:16:36.460 --> 02:16:38.861
Do you feel responsible
for the show failing?

02:16:38.930 --> 02:16:41.297
The show didn't fail.

02:16:46.437 --> 02:16:49.065
The man I work for --
a guy named Isaac Jaffee --

02:16:49.139 --> 02:16:52.599
[Sighs]
he took a chance on me,

02:16:52.709 --> 02:16:57.910
and...l didn't rise
to meet his expectations.

02:16:57.982 --> 02:17:00.746
And there are people
who work for me

02:17:00.817 --> 02:17:04.584
who needed me to be
a better field captain.

02:17:04.656 --> 02:17:09.423
The show didn't fail,
but I do feel responsible,

02:17:09.494 --> 02:17:12.429
and that's gonna have
to be all right with you.

02:17:12.496 --> 02:17:15.432
You know what would make
you feel better right now?

02:17:15.500 --> 02:17:17.195
[Chuckles softly]
Really, nothing.

02:17:17.268 --> 02:17:20.169
You don't want to hear what I
think would make you feel better?

02:17:20.237 --> 02:17:21.672
I really don't.

02:17:21.739 --> 02:17:23.433
In the 3-day history

02:17:23.508 --> 02:17:26.205
of our relationship, have I
been wrong about anything?

02:17:26.277 --> 02:17:27.972
Look --

02:17:28.046 --> 02:17:30.139
Dana, I'm what
the world considers

02:17:30.215 --> 02:17:32.980
to be a phenomenally
successful man,

02:17:33.050 --> 02:17:36.486
and I've failed much more
than I've succeeded.

02:17:36.554 --> 02:17:39.489
And each time I fail,
I get my people together,

02:17:39.557 --> 02:17:43.494
and I say,
"Where are we going?"

02:17:43.561 --> 02:17:46.656
And it starts
to get better.

02:17:46.731 --> 02:17:49.165
And that's
what you should do.

02:17:49.234 --> 02:17:52.169
That's it?

02:17:52.236 --> 02:17:53.534
Yeah.

02:17:53.605 --> 02:17:56.040
-- "Where are we going?"
-- Yeah.

02:17:56.107 --> 02:18:00.202
-- That was what you thought was
gonna make me feel better? -- Yeah.

02:18:00.278 --> 02:18:02.178
-- If I just say to my people,
“VVhere are we going?“ -- Yeah.

02:18:02.246 --> 02:18:04.682
Do I have to close me eyes
or click my heels or anything?

02:18:04.749 --> 02:18:06.308
Well, you can mock it
if you want to.

02:18:06.384 --> 02:18:07.476
I think I will, thanks.

02:18:07.552 --> 02:18:09.145
That's what you thought --

02:18:09.219 --> 02:18:11.689
By the way, the streak
is certainly over.

02:18:11.755 --> 02:18:13.690
So is my lunch break.

02:18:13.758 --> 02:18:15.691
You, uh, want
this at the bar?

02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:17.626
Thanks.

02:18:19.430 --> 02:18:24.027
Jack, [Clears throat] I'm leaving
this on the table, okay?

02:18:24.102 --> 02:18:26.230
Yeah.

02:18:28.740 --> 02:18:33.370
Hey, Dana...
it's not over yet.

02:18:33.443 --> 02:18:35.378
MDl-Transcom could step up
with the money

02:18:35.446 --> 02:18:37.209
and outbid the other guys.

02:18:37.281 --> 02:18:39.046
You think that's
what's gonna happen?

02:18:39.117 --> 02:18:41.210
No.

02:18:41.286 --> 02:18:44.847
<i>Man on TV: Some analysts feel that
the market has already taken...</i>

02:18:44.922 --> 02:18:45.855
<i>Sandwiches.</i>

02:18:45.923 --> 02:18:46.856
Sandwiches.

02:18:46.924 --> 02:18:48.289
Now we can focus.

02:18:48.359 --> 02:18:50.521
Uh, hey, Dave, this ladder's
been up here all day.

02:18:50.594 --> 02:18:52.825
I've walked underneath it,
like, seven times now.

02:18:52.897 --> 02:18:54.365
I mean, how much bad luck
do we need?

02:18:54.432 --> 02:18:56.924
-- Plus there's karma to consider.
-- Stop with the karma.

02:18:57.001 --> 02:18:58.628
-- Could you get a grip to move it?
-- Yeah, sure. -- Thanks.

02:18:58.702 --> 02:19:01.001
All right, we're gonna go in
there, and we're gonna focus now.

02:19:03.741 --> 02:19:06.802
[Sighs deeply]

02:19:06.878 --> 02:19:08.675
-- So...
-- Yep.

02:19:08.745 --> 02:19:11.647
-- The show.
-- Yep.

02:19:11.716 --> 02:19:13.616
Can you believe she sent me
flowers right out of the blue?

02:19:13.684 --> 02:19:14.811
-- Back to the office.
-- Yeah.

02:19:14.886 --> 02:19:15.943
Can't focus here.

02:19:16.020 --> 02:19:17.385
-- Vibe's all wrong in here.
-- Yes.

02:19:17.455 --> 02:19:19.048
-- <i>Out here I can focus.</i>
-- <i>Yes.</i>

02:19:19.123 --> 02:19:20.090
I'm focusing already.

02:19:20.157 --> 02:19:22.217
Hey, Danny,
did you get my flowers?

02:19:26.763 --> 02:19:28.391
<i>Rebecca: Are you all right?
Dan: Yeah.</i>

02:19:28.466 --> 02:19:30.093
<i>Casey: You sure?
-- Yeah.</i>

02:19:30.168 --> 02:19:32.000
-- <i>You got hit in the head with</i> a <i>ladder.</i>
-- Yeah, I <i>saw it.</i>

02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:34.437
-- I guess not soon enough, huh?
-- I guess not.

02:19:34.504 --> 02:19:35.630
Hey, how you doin', Rebecca?

02:19:35.707 --> 02:19:37.038
-- I'm great.
-- You look fantastic.

02:19:37.108 --> 02:19:38.337
-- <i>You look good, too.</i>
-- Thank <i>you.</i>

02:19:38.409 --> 02:19:39.877
-- You've been working out.
-- Yeah.

02:19:39.943 --> 02:19:41.275
-- You changed your hair.
-- Yes.

02:19:41.346 --> 02:19:42.780
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey...

02:19:42.847 --> 02:19:45.248
-- I'm sitting here with a massive
head wound. -- You're fine.

02:19:45.316 --> 02:19:47.250
You went to medical school in the
year since I've seen you last?

02:19:47.317 --> 02:19:49.150
-- I'll <i>leave you two alone.</i>
-- <i>Do not leave us alone.</i>

02:19:49.220 --> 02:19:50.745
I'm gonna go back in
the office and focus.

02:19:50.822 --> 02:19:52.221
-- I'm right behind you.
-- Take your time.

02:19:52.290 --> 02:19:54.418
So you got my flowers?

02:19:54.492 --> 02:19:56.324
Flowers?

02:19:56.394 --> 02:19:57.555
I sent you flowers.

02:19:57.628 --> 02:19:58.686
Those were from you?

02:19:58.763 --> 02:20:00.458
They had a card
that said "R.W."

02:20:00.531 --> 02:20:02.829
-- Ahh... -- You didn't
know they were from me?

02:20:02.900 --> 02:20:04.299
I thought they were
from Robert Wagner.

02:20:04.369 --> 02:20:05.598
What do you have going on
with Robert Wagner?

02:20:05.670 --> 02:20:08.105
-- I am much beloved, Rebecca.
-- Yes.

02:20:08.172 --> 02:20:10.470
And it's almost 6:00, and Casey and
I haven't started writing yet.

02:20:10.541 --> 02:20:12.407
-- Why haven't you started? -- We're
having a little focus problem.

02:20:12.477 --> 02:20:14.411
-- Why? -- Continental
Corp's being sold.

02:20:14.479 --> 02:20:17.312
-- I know. - I wasn't sure if the VVest
Coast office heard about the news.

02:20:17.382 --> 02:20:20.283
I know the East Coast office, where
you used to work, has heard about it.

02:20:20.351 --> 02:20:22.581
I just didn't know if those who
transferred out to the VVest

02:20:22.653 --> 02:20:24.587
to be with their husbands
had heard about it yet.

02:20:24.655 --> 02:20:27.249
I've moved back here.

02:20:27.325 --> 02:20:29.293
I gotta get back to work.

02:20:29.360 --> 02:20:32.057
Steve and I
are divorced now.

02:20:34.232 --> 02:20:35.563
You're actually divorced?

02:20:35.633 --> 02:20:37.123
Yes.

02:20:37.201 --> 02:20:39.636
You're divorced, I mean,
not just in Rebecca Land?

02:20:39.704 --> 02:20:40.933
No, I'm divorced
in every land.

02:20:41.005 --> 02:20:43.372
Okay, 'cause the last time you were
divorced, you know, not so much.

02:20:43.441 --> 02:20:44.738
Would you like
to take me to dinner?

02:20:44.809 --> 02:20:46.743
I just got hit in the head with a ladder.
I got to buy you food now?

02:20:46.811 --> 02:20:49.940
Dinner could help you focus.
I could help you focus.

02:20:50.014 --> 02:20:53.814
Yeah, 'cause you've always
had that effect on me.

02:20:53.885 --> 02:20:54.875
Should I wait
in the greenroom?

02:20:54.952 --> 02:20:56.181
Why don't you wait
in your office?

02:20:56.254 --> 02:20:59.224
Oh, hang on, that's right, I forgot,
you don't work here anymore.

02:20:59.290 --> 02:21:01.384
-- [Both chuckle]
-- I'll wait in the greenroom.

02:21:01.459 --> 02:21:03.587
Rebecca...

02:21:03.661 --> 02:21:05.060
you really do
look good.

02:21:05.129 --> 02:21:07.325
I know.

02:21:12.437 --> 02:21:15.566
<i>-- He'!-
-- He'!-</i>

02:21:15.640 --> 02:21:18.041
-- What are you doing?
-- I'm looking out the window.

02:21:18.109 --> 02:21:19.975
-- What are you doing? --
Returning Isaac's tape dispenser.

02:21:20.044 --> 02:21:22.445
-- Why did you have his tape dispenser?
-- It was the good one.

02:21:22.513 --> 02:21:25.483
There is such a thing as a <i>good</i> tape
dispenser and a bad tape dispenser?

02:21:25.550 --> 02:21:26.881
Yes, but since they're
cosmetically identical,

02:21:26.951 --> 02:21:29.579
I made the switch. I always
felt pretty bad about that.

02:21:29.654 --> 02:21:31.986
You seem to be taking
this all pretty well.

02:21:32.056 --> 02:21:33.319
I'm not.

02:21:33.391 --> 02:21:37.157
<i>I didn't think you were,
but it seems that way.</i>

02:21:37.228 --> 02:21:39.822
You're gonna
get a lot of offers.

02:21:39.897 --> 02:21:41.331
So are you.

02:21:41.399 --> 02:21:43.493
I wanted this job so bad.

02:21:43.568 --> 02:21:45.434
You got the job.

02:21:45.503 --> 02:21:46.937
Thank you for that,
by the way.

02:21:47.004 --> 02:21:48.130
You're welcome.

02:21:48.206 --> 02:21:49.332
Remember your interview?

02:21:49.407 --> 02:21:50.670
With you and Dana?

02:21:50.741 --> 02:21:52.106
-- Before that -- just me.
-- Yeah.

02:21:52.176 --> 02:21:54.201
You had the job when
you walked in the door.

02:21:54.278 --> 02:21:55.643
I tripped.

02:21:55.713 --> 02:21:58.808
-- Yes, and then you said “Excuse
me“ to the threshold. -- Yes.

02:21:58.883 --> 02:22:00.373
I wanted to do one
of those things

02:22:00.451 --> 02:22:04.081
where you shut the door, knock
everything off the desk and, you know...

02:22:04.155 --> 02:22:07.489
VVell, I don't think you'd have
had to use a lot of force on me.

02:22:17.201 --> 02:22:18.965
Where are you going?

02:22:19.036 --> 02:22:20.526
<i>Natalie</i> --

02:22:20.605 --> 02:22:22.130
-- Great job in I.A.
-- Yeah.

02:22:22.206 --> 02:22:23.503
-- Let's review --
-- Danny...

02:22:23.574 --> 02:22:26.373
solid network, big audience,
more money, warm weather,

02:22:26.444 --> 02:22:27.673
Laker Girls.

02:22:27.745 --> 02:22:29.406
Now, we got
girls here, Danny.

02:22:29.480 --> 02:22:31.312
We don't have Laker Girls,
my young friend.

02:22:31.382 --> 02:22:32.713
I can't do it.

02:22:32.783 --> 02:22:34.182
I know.

02:22:34.252 --> 02:22:36.550
-- I can't take Charlie out of school.
-- I know.

02:22:36.621 --> 02:22:39.420
-- He does well in school.
He's got friends. -- I know.

02:22:39.490 --> 02:22:40.651
Danny...

02:22:40.725 --> 02:22:43.456
[Sighs deeply]

02:22:43.528 --> 02:22:45.826
You gotta go
out there yourself.

02:22:45.897 --> 02:22:47.763
Casey --

02:22:47.832 --> 02:22:50.699
You can do it
without me, Danny.

02:22:50.768 --> 02:22:52.702
This is it?

02:22:52.770 --> 02:22:55.569
You can do it
without me.

02:22:55.640 --> 02:22:58.075
<i>You should think about it.</i>

02:22:58.142 --> 02:23:02.010
Let's write.

02:23:03.748 --> 02:23:05.978
Okay.

02:23:06.050 --> 02:23:07.643
[Groans]

02:23:10.922 --> 02:23:13.823
[Keyboard keys clicking]

02:23:28.673 --> 02:23:30.664
I'll be right back.

02:23:34.111 --> 02:23:38.241
[indistinct voices]

02:23:38.316 --> 02:23:41.911
[Mechanical whirring]

02:23:53.264 --> 02:23:54.993
Hi.

02:23:55.066 --> 02:23:56.363
-- Hi.
-- How you doin'?

02:23:56.434 --> 02:23:58.459
-- There's good fruit in the greenroom.
-- Yeah.

02:23:58.536 --> 02:24:01.130
-- You're canceling dinner. -- You
know what? This isn't the best night.

02:24:01.205 --> 02:24:03.731
Danny, I can show you the divorce papers
if you want. I carry them with me.

02:24:03.808 --> 02:24:05.469
They made us a job offer
in I.A.,

02:24:05.543 --> 02:24:07.602
but Casey's gonna stay here.

02:24:07.678 --> 02:24:09.271
And I think I'm not.

02:24:09.347 --> 02:24:12.078
If it turns out “Sports Night“'s over,
I'm gonna have to make that decision,

02:24:12.149 --> 02:24:13.981
and, frankly, I don't want
you factoring into that.

02:24:14.051 --> 02:24:15.883
I'm just talking
about dinner, Danny.

02:24:15.953 --> 02:24:18.081
I believe if I have dinner
with you tonight,

02:24:18.155 --> 02:24:20.180
