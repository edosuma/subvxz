DUMB OR RETARDED OR ANYTHING.

09:55.845 --> 09:58.883
BEFORE SHE FELL ASLEEP, I
TRIED TO GET HER TO TALK.

09:58.973 --> 10:01.931

NOT A WORD.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.046
<i>(Ilse, mentally)

11:56.174 --> 11:57.881
<i>THEY'RE DEAD!</i>

11:57.967 --> 12:00.880
<i>THEY'RE DEAD!
THEY'RE DEAD!</i>

12:08.728 --> 12:12.392
AND THERE'S NO VVAY OF GETTING
IN TOUCH VVITH HER RELATIVES?

12:12.523 --> 12:13.649
EVERYTHING BURNED.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.724
TOM POULTER SAID
THE NIELSENS GET

12:15.818 --> 12:18.560
THREE LETTERS FROM EUROPE
THE END OF EACH MONTH.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.403
MAYBE THEY'RE
FROM RELATIVES.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.405
WE CAN WAIT TILL
THE NEXT BATCH ARRIVES

12:22.492 --> 12:24.403
AND WRITE TO THE
THREE ADDRESSES.

12:24.494 --> 12:27.407
WHAT'LL WE DO WITH
THE GIRL UNTIL THEN?

12:27.538 --> 12:30.155
WELL, WE'LL HAVE
TO KEEP HER HERE.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.662
ONLY BE FOR A WEEK
OR SO, CORA.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.915
UNLESS THE GIRL
CAN TELL US SOMETHING.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.746
NOPE.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.172
YOU DON'T THINK
SHE CAN TALK, EITHER?

12:40.260 --> 12:44.003
I TRIED EVERYTHING I COULD
TO GET HER TO, BUT-

12:44.097 --> 12:46.179
THAT EXPLAINS IT.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.597
WHAT?

12:47.767 --> 12:49.474
THE TIMES MISS FRANK AND I TRIED

12:49.560 --> 12:52.268
TO TALK THE NIELSENS INTO
PUTTING THE GIRL IN SCHOOL,

12:52.313 --> 12:55.351
THE ANSWER
WAS ALWAYS NO.

12:55.441 --> 12:58.775
M-MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING
PHYSICALLY VVRONG VVITH HER.

12:58.861 --> 13:02.399
<i>WELL, WE'LL HA\IE DOC
STEKSER CHECK HER OVER.</i>

13:02.532 --> 13:04.614

HE'LL FIND ANYTHING.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.783
I JUST CAN'T
UNDERSTAND IT.

13:06.911 --> 13:09.824
THEY WERE--
EDUCATED PEOPLE.

13:09.956 --> 13:13.449
THEY DIDN'T E\/EN TEACH THEIR
OVVN DAUGHTER HOVV TO TALK.

13:13.543 --> 13:16.205
THEY WERE STRANGE
PEOPLE, TOO, CORA.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.537
THEY HARDLY EVER
SPOKE THEMSELVES.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.872
MIGHT NOT BE A BAD IDEA
TO PUT THE GIRL IN SCHOOL

13:20.967 --> 13:23.459
WHILE WE'RE WAITING
FOR THOSE LETTERS--

13:23.594 --> 13:26.461
<i>TEACH HER HOW
TO TALK, ANYWAY.</i>

13:26.597 --> 13:28.053
WELL, NOT RIGHT AWAY.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.384
<i>WHY NOT'? SHE HAS TO START

NOT BEING EDUCATED,

13:43.489 --> 13:45.480
NOT EVEN KNOWING
HOW TO TALK.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.236
HER FATHER
A PROFESSOR, TOO--

13:47.327 --> 13:50.740
KEEPING HIS OWN CHILD
IN IGNORANCE.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.663

GETTING AN EDUCATION.

26:58.867 --> 27:00.733

CERTAINLY SHOULD.

FATHER TRIED TO FORCE ME

35:09.608 --> 35:13.021
INTO THE SAME THING
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

35:13.111 --> 35:16.229

EVEN THOUGH THEY
THEMSELVES VVERE TRAPPED?

48:36.622 --> 48:41.367
BUT THE LOSS, THE
LOSS-- IT ISN'T RIGHT.

48:41.460 --> 48:43.838
THERE IS NO RIGHT OR
VVRONG TO IT, KARL.

48:43.921 --> 48:45.707
THEY ALL MEANT WELL.

48:45.798 --> 48:48.381
NO ONE VVANTED ANYTHING
BUT TO HELP HER.

48:48.467 --> 48:50.253
BUT TO
LOSE EVERYTHING?

48:50.344 --> 48:53.006
HM. SHE HAS NOT
LOST EVERYTHING.

48:53.097 --> 48:54.963
SHE HAS GAINED
SOMETHING, KARL.

48:55.057 --> 48:56.092
GAINED?

48:56.142 --> 48:58.133
<i>WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT
HOLGER AND FANNY</i>

48:58.227 --> 48:59.638
DID NOT REALLY
CARE FOR HER.

48:59.728 --> 49:01.639
<i>MARIA!</i>

49:01.730 --> 49:03.312
THEY WERE NOT UNKIND.

49:03.399 --> 49:05.015
THEY GAVE HER
WHAT AFFECTION

49:05.109 --> 49:07.191
THEY HAD IN
THEM TO GIVE.

49:07.278 --> 49:09.485
BUT THE PROJECT
ALWAYS CAME FIRST.

49:09.572 --> 49:11.062
YOU KNOW THAT, KARL.

49:11.157 --> 49:13.319
<i>FOR THEM, ILSE WAS
LESS A DAUGHTER</i>

49:13.409 --> 49:17.494
<i>THAN SHE WAS AN
EXPERIMENT IN FLESH.</i>

49:17.580 --> 49:19.412
SHE'S GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

49:19.498 --> 49:21.910
FOR NOW, SHE'S LOVED,

49:22.001 --> 49:26.495
AND THAT IS SO MUCH MORE
IMPORTANT THAN TELEPATHY.

49:26.589 --> 49:30.628
ISN'T IT?

49:30.676 --> 49:33.418
<i>YES, LIEBCHEN.</i>

49:33.512 --> 49:35.128
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT.

49:47.776 --> 49:51.019
<i>(narrator) IT HAS BEEN NOTED
IN A BOOK OF PROVEN WISDOM</i>

49:51.113 --> 49:53.605
<i>THAT PERFECT LOVE
CASTETH OUT FEAR.</i>

49:53.699 --> 49:55.940
<i>WELL, IT'S UNLIKELY
THAT THIS OBSERVATION</i>

49:56.035 --> 49:58.447
<i>WAS MEANT TO INCLUDE
THAT SPECIFIC FEAR</i>

49:58.537 --> 50:01.529
<i>WHICH FOLLOWS THE LOSS
OF EXTRASENSORY PERCEPTION.</i>

50:01.624 --> 50:04.867
<i>THE PRINCIPLE REMAINS,
AS ALWAYS, BEAUTIFULLY INTACT.</i>

50:04.960 --> 50:07.577

THAT OF ILSE NIELSEN,</i>

50:07.671 --> 50:09.958
<i>FORMER RESIDENT

50:49.296 --> 50:51.913
SOMETHING GLITTERED
DOWN THERE.

WHAT IS IT?

50:53.509 --> 50:54.795
SOMETHING DOWN THERE?

50:54.885 --> 50:56.000
MASON THINKS SO.

50:56.095 --> 50:57.426
THERE WAS SOMETHING.

51:14.321 --> 51:16.232
WE STAY TOGETHER.
