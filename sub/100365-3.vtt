WEBVTT

01:32.426 --> 01:33.427
Good luck, son.

01:49.985 --> 01:52.988
Remember, Cavanaugh?
Fifteen years ago at the Meceita ranch?

01:53.780 --> 01:55.824
Sugar rots the teeth.

01:55.908 --> 01:57.826
Take this, Iwegbuna.

01:58.577 --> 02:00.162
But you forgot one thing.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.831
To kill me.

02:03.665 --> 02:04.708
Get up!

02:31.652 --> 02:33.487
No more picture. Go home!

02:35.822 --> 02:38.825
We'll catch another movie next month.

02:39.826 --> 02:43.455
Your mother wants us
back at the shop soon anyhow.

02:53.507 --> 02:54.508
Chioke.

02:54.758 --> 02:57.094
Careful, my little cowboys.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.221
This is a big horse.

03:12.442 --> 03:15.946
Ned Nott was shot and Sam Shott was not.

03:19.533 --> 03:23.871
So, it is better to be Shott than Nott.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.033
Excuse me, is that seat taken?

04:02.159 --> 04:05.871
No. And it is a shame.
This is the second-best seat in the room.

04:06.288 --> 04:09.041
There's almost no glare
from the lights on the board.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.919
The best seat, of course, is mine.
We can rotate.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.546
Would you just mind moving?
'Cause we're all in a study group.

04:19.551 --> 04:20.552
Sure.

04:36.568 --> 04:39.988
Mr. Ah-Kee-Gee,
is there any reason you're standing?

04:49.206 --> 04:50.123
Yes?

04:50.791 --> 04:52.751
Can you extinguish your cigarette?

04:53.168 --> 04:56.004
It's public space
and the smoke is not that pleasant.

05:01.468 --> 05:04.054
Again, my sincere apologies for last week.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.307
As all of you know, Ms. Jones
is having some personal issues.

05:07.391 --> 05:09.434
So, we will be hiring a new TA.

05:09.518 --> 05:12.813
Anybody interested,
come see me after class.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.732
An exciting opportunity.
How much does it pay?

05:16.358 --> 05:18.193
Again, see me after class.

05:18.861 --> 05:22.739
Kenneth Arrow's theorem of
welfare economics. What do we think?

06:12.331 --> 06:13.624
My mail finally came.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.584
I hope there's good news in your box, too.

06:16.168 --> 06:17.169
Sure.

06:45.572 --> 06:50.244
Brother! I am rounding
everyone up to come talk to you.

06:50.327 --> 06:51.870
How are you?

06:51.954 --> 06:54.164
Fine. Fine.

06:54.790 --> 06:55.832
Tell me the truth.

06:59.628 --> 07:01.338
I am surviving.

07:02.506 --> 07:06.093
You're the first Ikeji to touch America.

07:06.552 --> 07:08.262
Must be lonely.

07:08.804 --> 07:12.391
But remember the plan.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.059
Go to school.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.519
Get a degree.

07:15.602 --> 07:16.854
Come back home.

07:18.522 --> 07:21.525
You'll soon be back here where you belong.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.862
Running Dad's shop beside me.

07:25.487 --> 07:26.947
He's smiling at us from heaven.

07:27.865 --> 07:30.325
Iwegbuna! Hello!

07:32.619 --> 07:34.162
Gramma's talking.

07:34.413 --> 07:37.291
Mma, you don't have to dress up
in order to send a tape.

07:37.708 --> 07:41.044
I will dress for my son.

07:42.713 --> 07:44.965
I sent you some cloth I wove!

07:45.048 --> 07:46.842
It's been selling out in the store.

07:49.261 --> 07:52.347
Know that God is keeping us well.

07:52.431 --> 07:54.892
There has been some fighting

07:54.975 --> 07:56.977
between soldiers and the president,

07:57.060 --> 07:59.271
but it doesn't sound too bad.

07:59.688 --> 08:02.191
I want to see you.

08:02.733 --> 08:06.236
Save up faster so you can come home.

08:07.571 --> 08:10.866
Move away from the recorder now.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.367
I'm talking with--

08:26.298 --> 08:29.801
Some say Nott was not shot.

08:29.885 --> 08:33.013
But Shott says he shot Nott.

08:33.096 --> 08:38.393
Either the shot Shott shot at Nott
was not shot,

08:38.477 --> 08:40.562
or Nott was shot.

08:40.645 --> 08:41.897
Okay. Good.

08:41.980 --> 08:46.818
Good. Remember, the goal is one sound.

08:46.902 --> 08:49.988
On to today's extemporaneous speech,

08:50.072 --> 08:51.907
"What I Did This Weekend."

08:51.990 --> 08:53.033
Leith.

08:54.201 --> 08:57.079
I buried me dog.
Funeral an' all 'cause of me gal.

08:57.162 --> 09:00.374
A nod's as good as a wink to a blind horse
on that one, if you ask me.

09:04.545 --> 09:08.423
Okay. What an improvement.

09:09.675 --> 09:12.719
I lost my car in a parking lot.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.016
Okay.

09:20.644 --> 09:23.730
My mother dresses up
even though I cannot see her.

09:23.814 --> 09:26.692
My nieces and nephews are out of control.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.902
My brother is worried that I am lonely

09:28.986 --> 09:32.322
and suggested that I visit
my Nigerian friends in Tulsa soon.

09:32.406 --> 09:33.574
We are going to do--

09:34.199 --> 09:39.955
Okay. Remember, we were supposed
to talk about our life here, not Nigeria,

09:40.038 --> 09:41.540
what we did this weekend.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.208
Yes, that is what I am doing.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.794
Oh, I'm a little confused.

09:45.878 --> 09:47.504
But why are you only confused with me?

09:47.588 --> 09:49.173
My elocution is fine.

09:50.174 --> 09:52.968
I don't have Karolina's
whisper-whisper problem,

09:53.385 --> 09:55.262
and my accent is not as thick as Leith's.

09:55.345 --> 09:56.388
Haud yer wheesht.

09:56.471 --> 09:57.806
Okay.

09:58.307 --> 10:03.270
Remember, we talked about
not alienating our "audience," right,

10:03.353 --> 10:06.023
by pointing out their personal challenges.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.275
But wasn't everything I said true?

10:09.526 --> 10:12.988
No, I think people perhaps
are more forthright in Nigeria.

10:21.038 --> 10:22.497
Good afternoon, Professor Robbins.

10:22.581 --> 10:24.791
I filled my TA application weeks ago.

10:24.875 --> 10:25.959
When do we hear?

10:26.543 --> 10:29.129
The application window hasn't closed yet.

10:29.838 --> 10:33.634
I see. Well, to refresh your memory,
I'm the best in class.

10:34.092 --> 10:36.803
I have the most need, and the money
will help me to get back home this summer.

10:36.887 --> 10:40.015
I'm trying to hire a student
who can teach in my stead.

10:40.098 --> 10:42.726
-That is me.
-You're also extremely pushy.

10:42.809 --> 10:43.894
How am I pushy?

10:44.311 --> 10:47.564
Well, take for example how you're
going about trying to get this job.

10:48.357 --> 10:52.945
Look, the truth is,
you make people a little uncomfortable.

10:53.028 --> 10:55.239
And for someone
who wants to join the faculty,

10:55.322 --> 10:58.575
you don't seem to try very hard to fit in.

10:59.368 --> 11:01.370
Now, if you'll excuse me.

11:34.194 --> 11:39.116
So, I says to him, "Sure, you can keep
your job. Long as I keep the paycheck."

11:51.003 --> 11:52.671
Can I help you with sumpin'?

11:53.255 --> 11:56.133
This... is a wonderful place.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.427
Thank ya.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.265
You know your hat size?

12:05.142 --> 12:07.561
I do not. But I would like to.

12:12.983 --> 12:16.528
-What you said this was for again?
-To wear.

12:16.612 --> 12:18.906
Well, right, but to wear to where?

12:20.365 --> 12:22.910
Well, every one's
for something different, see?

12:23.327 --> 12:26.163
That's a Ten-gallon. The Cattleman. Gus.

12:26.580 --> 12:27.998
Cutter, Brick, Gambler.

12:28.665 --> 12:29.791
What you looking for?

12:31.251 --> 12:34.546
I want the hat that is strongest.

12:54.483 --> 12:56.026
Now, that's the one.

12:56.652 --> 12:57.903
That's the one.

13:02.074 --> 13:03.075
This is the price?

13:03.534 --> 13:05.577
Well, that's a steal right there.

13:05.661 --> 13:07.120
Who pays this amount for anything?

13:08.330 --> 13:13.335
My pop gave me this hat
on my 18th birthday, 50 years ago.

13:13.418 --> 13:16.797
These ain't baseball caps, you understand?
These are investments.

13:17.339 --> 13:20.634
Pick the right one
and you'll have a partner for life.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.643
What's your shoe size?
You gonna need a pair of boots.

13:30.352 --> 13:32.187
No, I don't have any more money.

13:32.604 --> 13:35.107
Well, I didn't ask you about money.

13:35.858 --> 13:39.111
I know it don't look like it now,
but I understand. I been there.

13:39.945 --> 13:42.906
Vern, why don't you give him
them pair a boots

13:42.990 --> 13:44.658
I brought in here and left last week.

13:45.075 --> 13:46.743
Might be a bit big on ya.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.621
They'll chafe them heels like crazy.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.999
But if you soak 'em in a tub of water,

13:52.291 --> 13:53.542
they'll draw up.

13:54.084 --> 13:58.839
You are too kind.
And don't worry, boots cannot hurt me.

14:17.983 --> 14:19.109
Hello.

15:03.612 --> 15:08.367
Iwegbuna. I had to tape this immediately!

15:08.450 --> 15:10.827
It is too funny.

15:10.911 --> 15:15.207
Your cousin Eno's wedding is in three days

15:15.290 --> 15:17.709
and I wanted to cook.

15:17.793 --> 15:22.506
Your brother bought me
a live goat for stew.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.427
But this goat is too smart.

15:27.511 --> 15:29.596
It does not want to die.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.390
It ran away from him into the house--

15:32.099 --> 15:33.809
It's in here, Chioke!

15:37.396 --> 15:41.358
I'm telling you!
Your brother is a herdsman!

15:42.484 --> 15:43.694
Bad goat!

15:44.069 --> 15:48.323
Nothing you're doing over there is as
crazy as what is happening here.

15:48.949 --> 15:49.950
Mama.

15:50.367 --> 15:51.910
I need some help.

15:53.078 --> 15:54.246
No, not me.

15:54.329 --> 15:57.124
I'm too old for goat games.

16:02.254 --> 16:03.463
My son.

16:04.173 --> 16:05.632
Listen to me.

16:09.761 --> 16:13.640
I want you to experience something there

16:14.349 --> 16:16.226
before you return home.

16:17.186 --> 16:19.146
Yes, Mma.

16:59.770 --> 17:00.979
Oh, excuse me, sir.

17:02.940 --> 17:04.397
Mr. Ah-Kee-Gee.

17:05.943 --> 17:06.944
Why don't you...

17:08.319 --> 17:10.570
find a seat and we'll get started.

17:28.632 --> 17:33.679
So, picking up on the discussion
of advanced industrial development

17:34.596 --> 17:39.101
as it relates to
the stabilization of exchange rates.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.250
Move, cow.

18:04.710 --> 18:05.836
Move, cow.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.054
Bad cow!

18:16.138 --> 18:17.431
Ah, shit.

18:18.265 --> 18:19.558
Hey, what are you doing?

18:20.392 --> 18:23.187
-I'll help you.
-You're gonna hurt your damn self.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.271
Watch out.

18:30.694 --> 18:32.529
All right, stay back, now. Stay back.

18:34.198 --> 18:35.199
Settle.

18:35.991 --> 18:37.826
That wasn't quite what I was looking for.

18:37.910 --> 18:39.411
While you're here, give me a hand.

18:40.495 --> 18:42.664
Come on, son. Grab her backside.

18:43.123 --> 18:44.458
Easy, easy.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.213
You wanna help? Come on, give me a hand.

18:50.339 --> 18:51.798
You gotta get a hold of it, son.

18:53.926 --> 18:55.052
All right.

18:55.928 --> 18:59.431
Now, dig them pretty boots of yours
into the ground like they're tree stumps.

19:01.725 --> 19:04.478
Dig them boots in. Good. Good.

19:04.561 --> 19:05.771
Now, settle.

19:07.898 --> 19:09.316
Just be here with her.

19:16.698 --> 19:17.908
That's good.

19:22.287 --> 19:23.914
All right, you can let her go.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.832
All right, girl. Go ahead.

19:31.380 --> 19:34.091
Nice job, greenhorn. Get that gate.

19:56.989 --> 19:58.448
Orange soda, please.

20:00.909 --> 20:02.327
Put that on my tab.

20:23.515 --> 20:26.643
That's a big toothpick.
Where you get something like that?

20:28.395 --> 20:29.563
Nigeria.

20:29.980 --> 20:31.815
Shucks. You don't have to.

20:38.030 --> 20:41.200
First year in a pair of new boots
is always a doozy.

20:41.700 --> 20:44.578
Pretty soon you won't remember
how you ever got along without 'em.

20:46.038 --> 20:47.706
Those there will last you a lifetime.

20:56.757 --> 20:57.799
Three pitches.

20:57.883 --> 21:00.385
Three strikes. Three outs.

21:00.469 --> 21:04.306
Only in America can
such a perfect game exist.

21:04.806 --> 21:05.891
Baseball.

21:06.517 --> 21:12.022
Only in America do you add tax
after you see the ticket price.

21:12.773 --> 21:16.318
Only here do you...

21:17.778 --> 21:19.863
smile but you don't mean it.

21:20.739 --> 21:23.617
Karolina, such progress.

21:23.700 --> 21:24.701
Thank you.

21:35.629 --> 21:40.467
Here is something... only in America.

21:43.345 --> 21:44.388
Hamburgers.

21:45.722 --> 21:46.932
Cheeseburgers.

21:47.766 --> 21:49.476
Bacon cheeseburgers.

21:50.185 --> 21:52.271
Chili cheeseburgers.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.690
Bacon chili cheeseburgers.

21:54.773 --> 21:57.192
Why? Why do this?

21:57.276 --> 21:59.820
Have other food on your plate if you must.

21:59.903 --> 22:02.739
Have your bread, your tomato.

22:02.823 --> 22:06.243
But why wet lettuce? Why put cheese?

22:07.286 --> 22:09.705
Then bacon? A pig, too?

22:10.789 --> 22:16.044
This stacking everything on
top of everything, it's a sickness.

22:16.128 --> 22:17.379
What do you even taste?

22:17.796 --> 22:20.632
You taste the wet ketchup.
The wet mustard.

22:20.716 --> 22:21.884
The wet onions.

22:21.967 --> 22:25.637
The wet pickles.
The wettest, most wet secret sauce.

22:26.722 --> 22:30.184
When God made the meats,
do you think God said to Adam,

22:30.767 --> 22:32.269
"This must have the sauce."

22:33.729 --> 22:35.063
Why even have the cow?

22:35.147 --> 22:37.191
You will not notice if I let it run free.

22:37.274 --> 22:41.403
You will still say,
"What a delicious hamburger. Very wet."

22:42.571 --> 22:46.200
This is something only in America.

22:48.410 --> 22:49.786
Bravo.

23:11.183 --> 23:14.645
-I was just dancing.
-Jackson Six.

23:15.479 --> 23:17.397
Brothers. Sisters.

23:17.731 --> 23:20.567
It's so nice to see my old friends again.

23:20.651 --> 23:25.239
My legs fell asleep from four hours
of driving, but I made it.

23:25.322 --> 23:27.824
Hey, hey, hey! Iwegbuna!

23:27.908 --> 23:31.161
The African Howdy Doody has arrived.

23:33.497 --> 23:38.794
Brother, I knew you are lonely,
but come see us more instead of this, huh?

23:38.877 --> 23:41.380
We can pitch in for gas or drive to you.

23:41.463 --> 23:45.050
I was lonely, but it is getting better.

23:45.759 --> 23:47.511
-Victor, is there any more fufu left?
-Of course.

23:47.594 --> 23:51.139
I have traveled all the way to Tulsa
so I can eat real food.

23:51.849 --> 23:54.476
Don't get too excited.
It's made from Bisquick.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.603
I call it "Okie fufu."

23:58.230 --> 24:02.734
Iwegbuna, you're changing the subject.
Why are you dressed like that?

24:02.818 --> 24:04.528
-Yes.
-You and your cowboy fetish.

24:04.611 --> 24:05.988
Mr. Pony Express.

24:06.071 --> 24:11.827
Just as the Igbo man
understands the importance of home...

24:11.910 --> 24:12.953
Here we go.

24:13.036 --> 24:14.162
...so does a cowboy.

24:14.246 --> 24:15.581
-Okay.
-Yeah.

24:15.664 --> 24:18.166
We respect women and children.

24:18.625 --> 24:21.670
We walk with confidence
even though our country spat on us.

24:21.753 --> 24:23.046
That's right.

24:23.130 --> 24:25.799
What are we if not cowboy?

24:26.967 --> 24:27.968
Fire!

24:29.261 --> 24:31.805
I watched Westerns with my father
before he died.

24:31.889 --> 24:34.016
-Yeah.
-He was a cowboy, too.

24:40.564 --> 24:44.902
And to our host
and the pounder of Okie fufu.

24:44.985 --> 24:46.111
Thank you, Victor.

24:46.195 --> 24:48.030
You're welcome, you're welcome.

24:48.113 --> 24:51.241
-Yeah. You try it.
-I am so happy for this,

24:51.325 --> 24:55.579
but I cannot wait until I get home
and eat some of my mother's yam and egusi.

24:58.665 --> 25:02.211
Iwegbuna. When was the last time
you heard from your family?

25:02.878 --> 25:06.882
It's been a while. The mail service
in Nigeria has been terrible. Why?

25:07.216 --> 25:09.551
I had to cancel my plans
to go home this summer.

25:09.635 --> 25:11.094
I did as well.

25:11.178 --> 25:12.596
Things are getting bad again.

25:14.056 --> 25:15.098
Why all this fear?

25:16.099 --> 25:18.936
The country has survived the civil war.
What more can happen?

25:20.771 --> 25:24.024
You are too smart to be this naive.

25:24.107 --> 25:25.567
People are so scared right now,

25:25.651 --> 25:28.153
they are moving all their money
out of Nigerian banks.

25:28.237 --> 25:31.365
If I were you, I'd call home.

25:47.923 --> 25:48.924
Operator.

25:49.007 --> 25:50.217
-Operator?
-Yes?

25:50.300 --> 25:51.301
Yes.

25:51.385 --> 25:53.220
-International, please.
-What country?

25:53.303 --> 25:55.430
-Nigeria, Abiriba.
-What's the number?

25:55.514 --> 25:58.100
Just page me to their call center.
I need to leave a message.

25:58.183 --> 26:00.727
-Do you accept the charges?
-Yes. I'll accept the charges.

26:00.811 --> 26:01.812
Please hold.

26:20.372 --> 26:21.248
Iwegbuna.

26:21.331 --> 26:22.332
Chioke!

26:22.916 --> 26:24.209
Chioke! Speak up!

26:24.293 --> 26:25.502
You know the line is bad.

26:26.003 --> 26:27.212
Brother,

26:27.296 --> 26:29.214
it's so good to hear your voice.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.925
I wish I could see your face.

26:32.009 --> 26:33.260
What is happening?

26:33.343 --> 26:34.553
Listen.

26:34.636 --> 26:37.306
There's talk of a military takeover!

26:37.723 --> 26:38.724
You hear me?

26:39.016 --> 26:40.767
What are they doing now?

26:40.851 --> 26:42.227
No one knows.

26:42.311 --> 26:43.312
We are fine.

26:43.395 --> 26:45.147
We're packing up the business...

26:45.230 --> 26:47.274
just in case they try to take everything.

26:47.357 --> 26:48.817
What? I should come home.

26:48.901 --> 26:50.152
Tell him no.

26:50.235 --> 26:52.321
How long now? Wrap it up.

26:52.571 --> 26:57.159
I have just enough for a one-way.

26:57.242 --> 26:58.785
-I am coming home.
-No!

26:58.869 --> 27:01.038
-But the plan was--
-No, no, no!

27:01.121 --> 27:02.581
Plans change!

27:02.664 --> 27:05.292
There's no way to build anything
in Nigeria right now.

27:06.126 --> 27:07.211
You are over there.

27:07.669 --> 27:10.130
Make something of yourself where you can.

27:10.214 --> 27:13.592
That's how you will help us.

27:16.011 --> 27:17.012
Hello?

27:18.889 --> 27:19.973
Hello?

27:20.599 --> 27:21.683
Hello?

28:10.607 --> 28:12.651
So, tell me, Mr. Ah-Kee-Gee...

28:13.735 --> 28:16.280
why are you the best candidate
for this position?

28:18.407 --> 28:20.909
I don't know. Maybe I'm not.

28:21.827 --> 28:24.121
I don't even know
if I need this job anymore.

28:24.204 --> 28:27.708
Really? I mean, you've been
harassing me about this for weeks.

28:28.250 --> 28:29.751
What gives, Mr. Ah-Kee-Gee?

28:29.835 --> 28:30.836
"Ikeji,"

28:31.336 --> 28:34.173
not "Ah-Kee-Gee." Mr. Ikeji.

28:34.882 --> 28:37.968
I needed this job
so I could save money to visit home.

28:38.051 --> 28:41.638
My country has collapsed, and I will not
be going back for the foreseeable future.

28:49.897 --> 28:51.190
Well, Mr. Ikeji,

28:51.273 --> 28:55.360
Nigeria has oil,
so the economy will bounce back--

28:55.444 --> 28:58.322
No. When the oil came,
it made us feel rich.

28:58.405 --> 29:00.282
But it was just the beginning
of Dutch disease.

29:00.365 --> 29:04.411
Well, I'm not sure the Corden-Neary model
really applies in this instance, but I--

29:04.494 --> 29:08.457
It does. Nigeria basically functions
as a single-product economy.

29:08.999 --> 29:12.127
Oil was discovered,
the value of the currency spiked,

29:12.211 --> 29:14.254
but the broader economy stopped growing.

29:14.338 --> 29:17.591
Now it is extreme poverty
and widespread corruption.

29:18.634 --> 29:21.512
Now my country has been
overthrown by the military.

29:24.431 --> 29:26.892
I did read about that. I'm sorry.

29:28.560 --> 29:29.645
But I must say...

29:30.395 --> 29:34.608
Mr. Ikeji, the notion of Corden-Neary
in West Africa is...

29:35.609 --> 29:36.735
fascinating.

29:38.737 --> 29:43.033
The model is a great predictor of
destabilization in developing countries.

30:00.384 --> 30:01.426
Hello?

30:02.219 --> 30:03.303
Family!

30:03.637 --> 30:06.139
Chioke, how are you?

30:07.266 --> 30:10.769
Mma, I hope you're still
dressing up for me.

30:11.270 --> 30:12.729
Hello!

30:13.230 --> 30:16.692
We can't even trust
what the newspaper tells us anymore.

30:18.068 --> 30:20.028
Stop looking at that.

30:20.404 --> 30:22.823
Come listen to your brother's tape.

30:24.157 --> 30:27.327
I have been wanting to send you something

30:27.411 --> 30:29.121
to cheer us all up.

30:29.580 --> 30:31.915
Some goodgood, sweetsweet news.

30:31.999 --> 30:34.793
Your pride and joy, Iwegbuna Ikeji,

30:34.877 --> 30:36.712
has landed a job.

30:38.380 --> 30:40.340
I am a teacher's assistant
to Professor Robbins

30:40.424 --> 30:41.717
in the graduate economics department.

30:41.800 --> 30:45.220
And next semester,
I will lead a course on understanding

30:45.304 --> 30:48.473
economies of developing nation-states.

30:48.557 --> 30:50.517
Hey!

30:50.601 --> 30:51.727
Wow.

30:52.227 --> 30:55.480
Chioke, you know
I've rediscovered something?

30:55.564 --> 30:56.773
Cowboys.

30:58.025 --> 30:59.902
Cowboys are real.

30:59.985 --> 31:01.069
I've seen them.

31:01.486 --> 31:05.866
In fact, I'm watching them now
while talking to you.

31:06.742 --> 31:09.494
I want to see them myself. I wish I could.

31:12.873 --> 31:14.208
One day

31:14.291 --> 31:17.544
I will fly you all here
so you can meet them.

31:24.885 --> 31:26.386
It's a hard life for cowboys,

31:26.470 --> 31:29.556
but they survive it. Just like us.

31:32.017 --> 31:33.018
Chioke.

31:33.685 --> 31:35.687
The business may be gone,

31:35.771 --> 31:38.148
but your brilliant mind
will come up with another plan.

31:40.901 --> 31:43.153
Don't worry too much.

31:43.237 --> 31:44.613
I'll be fine here. I promise.

31:45.906 --> 31:48.033
I'm going to let
the tape record to the end.

31:48.408 --> 31:49.826
So you can hear the cows.

32:05.592 --> 32:08.512
But I think you can go
deeper into capital flow.

32:08.595 --> 32:10.514
They say "follow the money," right?

32:10.597 --> 32:12.307
-Thanks.
-Keep up the good work.

32:15.811 --> 32:16.854
Mr. Ikeji.

32:18.313 --> 32:19.606
Is everything okay?

32:19.690 --> 32:21.859
There's a department custom to...

32:22.401 --> 32:25.529
hand-deliver the first paycheck
to new faculty.

32:27.030 --> 32:28.156
We're happy to have you.

32:28.907 --> 32:32.327
My advice:
spend that on something special.
