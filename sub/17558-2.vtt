WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:03.671
You wanted to see me?
Sorry. I was rock-climbing.

00:03.704 --> 00:05.639
You were getting
a hot-oil massage.

00:05.673 --> 00:08.642
My imagination will not be held
prisoner to my lazy body.
Bryan,

00:08.676 --> 00:10.544
what if I told you
the gardener found your puppy

00:10.578 --> 00:11.645
in the bottom of the pool?

00:11.679 --> 00:13.181
That he sank
like a fluffy stone?

00:13.214 --> 00:14.382
Oh, my God, no!

00:14.415 --> 00:16.384
Just kidding.
The puppy's fine.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.152
Perspective, baby.
I wanted you to see

00:18.186 --> 00:22.190
how bad it could be
when you saw this.

00:22.223 --> 00:25.393
This is a rare Wormley sofa
I bought at auction.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.061
I outbid James Franco just so

00:27.095 --> 00:28.596
I could see his neck vein
throbbing in sexy frustration!

00:28.629 --> 00:30.231
Who would do something
like this?

00:30.264 --> 00:32.333
I bet it was
that damn surrogate's kid.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.435
See, this is why
my people spank.

00:34.468 --> 00:35.603
Is this what
having children means?

00:35.636 --> 00:38.606
That I have to give up all
the beautiful things in my life?

00:38.639 --> 00:39.740
I have OCD, you know.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.275
Obsessive Chic Disorder.

00:41.309 --> 00:42.610
Bryan, maybe it's
a good thing

00:42.643 --> 00:44.412
Goldie's pee test
was negative.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.214
If you and David have a baby,

00:46.247 --> 00:47.748
this is gonna be your lives
for 18 years.

00:47.781 --> 00:50.284
Maybe you're not ready
for such a brutal change.

00:50.318 --> 00:52.420
Also, I need a raise.

00:52.453 --> 00:53.621
Hey, Rocky.
Bryan, come on.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.123
We're going to be late
to meet Goldie.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.557
David, look at this.
Look at this!

00:56.590 --> 00:58.692
Look what that miniature
Sally Jesse Raphael did!

00:58.726 --> 01:00.728
Is that you?
He does make
that face.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.530
(gasps)
DAVID:
Come on. Shania's a kid.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.198
Kids do stuff
like this.

01:04.232 --> 01:06.367
Obviously, if we're
going to have a baby,

01:06.400 --> 01:08.136
our lives are going
to change a lot.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.338
Wait! I thought
rent-a-belly turned out

01:10.371 --> 01:12.673
not to be in the gay family way.

01:12.706 --> 01:15.276
Now, is she, or isn't she?

01:15.309 --> 01:18.712
Why are you both
looking at me like that?
'Cause you're a doctor.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.348
The negative
we got could just be

01:20.381 --> 01:22.316
'cause it was too early
for a urine test.

01:22.350 --> 01:26.454
But this blood test
detects the hCG hormone,

01:26.487 --> 01:29.257
which is the one that we want,
a week after conception.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.591
(buzzer sounding)

01:30.624 --> 01:33.461
Bryan,

01:33.494 --> 01:35.363
are you mad at me
'cause my pee test was negative?

01:35.396 --> 01:36.664
No, honey.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.566
Your daughter colored
on my fancy couch,

01:38.599 --> 01:40.268
and frankly,
I'm having a moment.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.536
She did what?! I'm so sorry.

01:42.570 --> 01:45.539
I'll pay to have it cleaned.
My couch was an exquisite
leather antique.

01:45.573 --> 01:48.509
Now we'll just think of it as
Judi Dench with a tramp-stamp.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.411
I'll knit you an afghan
to cover it up.
Please don't.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.812
Now, look,
we love watching Shania

01:51.845 --> 01:53.847
while you get settled
into your new place.

01:53.881 --> 01:56.384
She is very well behaved.
I'm sure there's an explanation.

01:56.417 --> 01:57.785
Yeah. I'll talk to her
when I get home.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.587
No. You know what?

01:59.620 --> 02:01.889
Why don't we have Bryan talk
to her?

02:01.922 --> 02:04.225
Ooh.
It'll be good practice
for when he's a dad.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.227
I feel so bad
about this.
Oh, please don't.

02:06.260 --> 02:09.230
Don't. I'm used to living
with imperfection.

02:09.263 --> 02:10.698
Do you see how this side of my
face is degrees more handsome

02:10.731 --> 02:11.599
than this side?

02:11.632 --> 02:12.833
This side? This side?

02:12.866 --> 02:14.402
I don't see it.
I'm so sorry.

02:14.435 --> 02:15.803
I know! Identically handsome!

02:15.836 --> 02:18.339
(laughter)

02:18.372 --> 02:21.442
Do you think Shania's acting out
by drawing on your couch?

02:21.475 --> 02:23.244
Am I a terrible mom?
No.
No.

02:23.277 --> 02:26.280
No! You are
a terrific mom.

02:26.314 --> 02:28.416
Yeah.
Okay? You're doing
all this for her.

02:28.449 --> 02:31.219
Don't play with the buzzer.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.921
My God, Miss Pepper,
you look stunning today.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.723
Can you please get the
results of these samples

02:35.756 --> 02:36.724
as soon as possible?

02:36.757 --> 02:37.825
(laughs)

02:37.858 --> 02:39.827
I wouldn't rush it
if I were you.

02:39.860 --> 02:43.297
Thing comes back
positive, jig's up.

02:43.331 --> 02:45.833
Your life won't belong
to you anymore.
No, no, no.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.268
See, that is the thing

02:47.301 --> 02:49.370
that people do not understand
about parenting.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.305
It is all about
setting limits.

02:51.339 --> 02:53.841
You are in charge.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.477
Your life will only change
as much as you let it.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.778
(women laughing hysterically)

02:57.811 --> 03:00.414
Yeah, that's good.

03:00.448 --> 03:03.517
You are
hilarious.

03:03.551 --> 03:04.818
GOLDIE:
That made me feel better.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.291
I'm sorry to bother you,
sir, but when you're done,

03:10.324 --> 03:11.659
could you please
check the toilet?

03:11.692 --> 03:13.794
It's stopped up.
But not, um, from me.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.763
I bet the hombre
that lived here before you

03:15.796 --> 03:17.731
tried to flush his stash.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.400
Oh, not you, amigo.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.001
There's a bad bean
in every burrito.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.603
Nana...

03:22.636 --> 03:24.305
I drove 2,200 miles

03:24.338 --> 03:25.539
to get away from your opinions.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.541
Please, just go.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.477
You are my granddaughter,

03:29.510 --> 03:31.945
and I am not going anywhere
without you and the kid.

03:31.979 --> 03:34.748
I'll just stay in
the Best Western.

03:34.782 --> 03:37.485
It's the cleanest place
in the whole filthy city.

03:37.518 --> 03:39.553
The entire state should be
wrapped in a condom.

03:39.587 --> 03:42.523
(with accent):
Grey Gardens has fallen
into absolute disrepair.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.425
Don't be embarrassed,

03:44.458 --> 03:47.995
Mother Darling. Living in
squalor absolutely becomes you.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.597
What's with the lunatic?

03:49.630 --> 03:51.999
Oh. She watched a documentary
called Grey Gardens

03:52.032 --> 03:53.767
about a-a crazy
mother and daughter

03:53.801 --> 03:55.503
living in a
crumbling house.

03:55.536 --> 03:56.937
And now she's pretending
to be one of them.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.940
Goldie, you have got
to get Goggles home.

03:59.973 --> 04:02.876
This is home now.
No, don't say that anymore.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.845
Your daughter has no business

04:04.878 --> 04:07.581
spending time
with those candy packers

04:07.615 --> 04:10.017
in that Sodom and Gomorrah
fudge factory!

04:10.050 --> 04:12.019
Do you know that when
I went to pick her up

04:12.052 --> 04:14.555
earlier-- because
I am the only one

04:14.588 --> 04:16.023
in this family
that owns a car--

04:16.056 --> 04:18.692
I was blinded by gay.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.528
Those fruits are like
cannibals.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.563
All they eat is fruit.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.998
And you will never guess what
I found in the powder room.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.668
You mind?
Are you sure you're even
supposed to be using this one?

04:27.701 --> 04:29.403
If I could get up now,

04:29.437 --> 04:31.472
I would knock you
on your pterodactyl ass.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.040
But those bugle blowers saved

04:33.073 --> 04:35.309
the real kicker
for their bedroom.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.378
(screaming echoing)

04:37.411 --> 04:39.447
When I was a girl,
we studied presidents

04:39.480 --> 04:42.082
who own people
like this president.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.585
There are plenty
of lovely people in the world.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.888
I just don't happen
to be related to any of them.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.623
She's a freakin' nut job!

04:49.657 --> 04:51.525
She can hear you!

04:51.559 --> 04:52.926
Please, just go!

04:54.061 --> 04:56.330
Fine.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.098
Just let me know
if you're pregnant.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.768
I'd like to send a
congratulations card...

05:00.801 --> 05:03.837
to Satan.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.473
(phone plays tune)

05:05.506 --> 05:08.075
It's been more than an hour,
so my pizza's free.

05:08.108 --> 05:09.109
It's me.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.378
Oh, Nana, thank God.

05:10.411 --> 05:11.111
Did you make Goldie
love me again?

05:11.144 --> 05:12.480
Stop whining!

05:12.513 --> 05:14.014
Grow a pair, put on pants,

05:14.047 --> 05:15.849
get on a plane,

05:15.883 --> 05:18.519
and stop your lady
from screwing up her life.

05:18.552 --> 05:21.088
Yeah, what do I do
about my pizza?

05:21.121 --> 05:23.357
What is up?
Your sucky suck game sucks

05:23.391 --> 05:24.592
more than you usually suck.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.527
Yeah? I'm a little distracted.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.697
Debating on whether to share
a little piece of life news.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.732
Oh, so you do know how to share,
just not the ball.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.967
Pass it, man! Aah!

05:34.001 --> 05:36.370
Can you bend it?
Could be a ligament.

05:36.404 --> 05:37.838
Could be a scaphoid fracture
along the carpus here.

05:37.871 --> 05:38.839
Let's go to my office
and get an X-ray.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.508
Guys!

05:40.541 --> 05:42.976
Ryan and I may be having a baby.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.912
Oh.
No!

05:44.945 --> 05:47.548
Homosexuality is the ultimate
form of birth control!

05:47.581 --> 05:48.949
How could you do
this to us, David?

05:48.982 --> 05:50.718
What? Do what?
What are you talking about?

05:50.751 --> 05:52.052
Don't you know?!

05:52.085 --> 05:53.687
We live through you!

05:53.721 --> 05:54.655
When you watch hockey

05:54.688 --> 05:56.056
without multitasking

05:56.089 --> 05:57.691
a game of Candyland--

05:57.725 --> 05:58.926
every single time,

05:58.959 --> 06:01.995
all of us--
we pretend to be you,

06:02.029 --> 06:04.064
just without the guy-on-guy sex.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.499
That's funny.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.668
I thought you guys
would be happy for us.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.002
Hearing about your life
without kids--

06:09.036 --> 06:10.404
that's what
makes us happy!

06:10.438 --> 06:12.105
And now
you've screwed it all up!

06:12.139 --> 06:14.408
You're gay! You could've avoided
this whole parenting mess!

06:14.442 --> 06:16.577
You could have gotten
out alive, man.

06:16.610 --> 06:19.880
I have a three-year-old son
and six-month-old twin girls.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.650
Do you know the last time
I made love to my wife?

06:22.683 --> 06:25.453
Seriously. I'm asking you.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.688
Do you know?
Because I don't!

06:27.721 --> 06:30.624
They say you don't know real
love till you have children.

06:30.658 --> 06:32.526
Yes, you do. It's called
spare cash, free time

06:32.560 --> 06:33.961
and daylight masturbation.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.863
I don't know anything
about the guy

06:35.896 --> 06:38.165
who invented sleep deprivation
as a torture technique.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.934
The one thing I do know--
that dude's got kids.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.836
You guys are scaring me.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.505
Couldn't have told me all this

06:44.538 --> 06:46.073
before I went
into that little room

06:46.106 --> 06:48.676
with the cup and
the Kevin Bacon DVD?

06:48.709 --> 06:50.644
Breathe deep, man.

06:50.678 --> 06:53.614
These are your
last moments of freedom.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.749
I'm letting the couch thing go.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.150
I mean, it's just stuff.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.052
Right? It's not like
stuff can love you,

06:59.086 --> 07:01.021
or stuff can take care of you
in your old age.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.890
Then again,
I don't really intend to age.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.625
It's just so expected, you know?

07:04.658 --> 07:06.727
What's wrong with you?
Looks like you just learned

07:06.760 --> 07:07.761
the Green Lantern is gay
all over again.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.196
The guys are right.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.765
If Goldie's test is positive,
our lives are over.

07:11.799 --> 07:14.234
Yes, David, it's just like
the schoolyard song.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.670
(reciting rhythmically):
Bryan and David,
sittin' in a tree

07:16.704 --> 07:19.206
K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.774
First comes love,

07:20.808 --> 07:22.743
then comes
the inability to marry,

07:22.776 --> 07:25.513
then comes a stranger and
an invasive medical procedure,

07:25.546 --> 07:27.848
then comes the baby
in the baby carriage.

07:27.881 --> 07:30.584
It's just,
I went from med school

07:30.618 --> 07:33.153
to my practice,
always so responsible.

07:33.186 --> 07:37.224
I mean, when was the last time
we went to a bar and cut loose?

07:37.257 --> 07:38.959
I don't know.
The night we met?

07:38.992 --> 07:42.596
Excuse me?
Uh, is this seat taken?

07:42.630 --> 07:43.764
It's for my date.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.999
But I don't
think he's coming.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.701
I got stood up.

07:47.735 --> 07:49.903
You dodged a bullet.

07:49.937 --> 07:52.506
Anyone who'd stand you up
must be crazy.

07:52.540 --> 07:53.774
Oh, my God, I
thought that, too,

07:53.807 --> 07:55.709
but I thought I
was the only one.

07:55.743 --> 07:56.810
You want to sit?

07:56.844 --> 07:58.979
Oh.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.049
I was supposed
to meet Lance Bass.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.617
Oh, I don't know him.

08:03.651 --> 08:06.219
Closeted singer?
From N+Sync? Got nothing?

08:06.253 --> 08:09.657
Are you sure you're in the
right type of bar, sir?

08:09.690 --> 08:12.760
Oh, uh, you see those guys
over there in the corner?

08:12.793 --> 08:15.195
Yeah. Those are my boys.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.664
Well, aren't you
the piggy eater.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.198
Oh, no, they're not like me.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.768
Us. Uh, we just graduated
med school today.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.002
That's a lot of reading.

08:22.035 --> 08:22.803
Well, I was out all day

08:22.836 --> 08:24.204
celebrating
with their girlfriends,

08:24.237 --> 08:26.006
so they wanted
to support me with my thing.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.875
Oh.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.210
Actually, I've never been
to one of these places before.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.079
Real smoky.

08:32.112 --> 08:34.948
Good God, no wonder you
keep those things sheathed.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.817
They're the color of
Picasso's most overrated period,

08:36.850 --> 08:39.953
or... or a box from Tiffany.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.094
Can I...?
(clears throat)

08:47.127 --> 08:49.897
May I buy you another drink?

08:49.930 --> 08:52.265
I'll leave right after,
I promise.

08:52.299 --> 08:55.769
It's just, my-my friends
are really rooting for me,

08:55.803 --> 08:57.204
and I don't want
to let them down.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.739
Come on. Let's dance.

08:58.772 --> 09:01.241
Huh? I don't really do that.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.744
You've never danced with
a boy before, have you?

09:03.777 --> 09:05.979
One that, you know, leads?

09:06.013 --> 09:07.581
It's Bananarama,
sweetie.

09:07.615 --> 09:09.216
We all do.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.051
Okay, so it's a plan.

09:11.084 --> 09:13.053
This week we are going out
just like we used to.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.788
Or like we never did.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.890
Yes. Before we fully morph
into an old lesbian couple.
Mm.

09:16.924 --> 09:19.092
Minus the frowns
and the gingerbread men bodies.

09:27.267 --> 09:30.704
My first instinct was never
to address the couch issue,

09:30.738 --> 09:31.805
just to use my energy to
wish you nothing but the worst.

09:31.839 --> 09:32.973
No friends at recess,

09:33.006 --> 09:34.642
female pattern baldness

09:34.675 --> 09:36.343
and a shampoo
without a single botanical.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.011
But David said, "No, be direct."

09:38.045 --> 09:39.947
So I decided
to fire you.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.715
Except you don't work for me
in any official capacity.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.050
(with accent):
Do you know of any Libra men?

09:43.083 --> 09:44.752
I find them so reasonable.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.353
In an attempt to practice
my parental skills,

09:46.386 --> 09:48.221
I've decided to
use words instead.

09:48.255 --> 09:52.159
You colored on my expensive
couch, and I am very upset.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.327
What do you have to say
for yourself?
I would never.

09:54.361 --> 09:57.230
I have too much regard
for antiquities of all kinds.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.099
Are you doing Little Edie
from Grey Gardens?

09:59.132 --> 10:00.801
Oh, what a clever judge
of character!

10:00.834 --> 10:02.402
Obsessed with that documentary!

10:02.435 --> 10:04.137
I wanted to be Little Edie
for Halloween,

10:04.171 --> 10:05.405
but my mother said I couldn't.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.808
She said I could go
as one of the feral cats.

10:07.841 --> 10:10.110
But joke's on my mom, though,
'cause Boots was a lady cat.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.679
Wait. Are you trying
to distract me?

10:11.712 --> 10:13.280
'Cause you're still
in a lot of trouble, Miss.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.848
If you can't get
a man to propose,

10:14.882 --> 10:15.916
then you might
as well be dead.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.217
Oh, I got another one.
Do it again.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.285
If you can't get
a man to propose,

10:18.318 --> 10:20.420
then you might
as well be dead.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.289
You just stay on the 405,
and you get off at Sepulveda.
Oh, okay.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.291
Oh, looks like you
two worked it out.
Well.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.059
Come on, baby. Nana said
I could only use the car

10:26.093 --> 10:27.227
until Bill O'Reilly's done.

10:27.260 --> 10:30.063
Time to go home.
No, I want to stay here.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.164
I like it here too, Shania.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.232
They don't
use old mail

10:32.265 --> 10:33.433
as coasters,
but it's not our home.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.968
Let's go.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.837
You can come back
and swim tomorrow.

10:36.870 --> 10:39.139
Bryan and I are going dancing.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.440
Which is why David
is dressed like

10:40.473 --> 10:42.009
one of Madonna's boyfriends.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.376
What? What's the matter
with this?

10:43.410 --> 10:44.411
This is my young outfit.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.279
Hmm. See ya.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.381
Oh, Mother Darling, must we
go back to Grey Gardens?

10:48.415 --> 10:50.017
I can't bear the stench

10:50.050 --> 10:51.719
of dying dreams.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.954
Why is she dressed like
a Hasidic grandma?

10:53.987 --> 10:55.823
(dance music playing)

10:58.959 --> 11:01.261
(sighs)

11:03.130 --> 11:06.366
How funny is Shania's
Little Edie impression?

11:06.399 --> 11:08.101
Yeah, who is Little Edie?

11:08.135 --> 11:10.237
I hate it when you pretend
not to know gay stuff

11:10.270 --> 11:11.705
so you seem less gay.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.073
But I don't know who that is.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.742
See? That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

11:16.744 --> 11:17.677
Thank you.
Thank you.

11:21.749 --> 11:22.950
Feels late.

11:22.983 --> 11:25.452
Ooh, 9:45.

11:25.485 --> 11:26.954
Did we tape
Say Yes to the Dress?

11:26.987 --> 11:28.789
Season pass.
Love you.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.160
Bry...

11:33.193 --> 11:36.463
we're here to
recapture our youth,

11:36.496 --> 11:38.799
but no matter how fast
we chase after it...

11:38.832 --> 11:40.367
we're never gonna catch it.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.203
So why don't we stop chasing
and admit defeat.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.873
Okay.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.340
We're getting older.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.408
You are.

11:48.441 --> 11:49.910
And I've agreed to be

11:49.943 --> 11:52.179
your youthful companion
until you wither and die.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.116
You know what?

11:56.149 --> 11:57.918
I don't care if
my life changes.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.119
I want it to.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.288
I want this baby.
I want this family.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.255
I want it all.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.757
And you know what?

12:03.791 --> 12:04.792
I want it with you.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.195
MAN:
Mmm. Hey...

12:09.329 --> 12:11.331
you guys want get with this?

12:11.364 --> 12:14.167
Young man, we are old
enough to be your fathers.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.405
Are we cougars?

12:18.438 --> 12:20.808
There's something else
I want, too.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.375
The good news is...

12:22.409 --> 12:24.111
once we're tired
of using these as curtains,

12:24.144 --> 12:25.478
we can take naps in them.

12:28.348 --> 12:31.218
I know we've been going through
a lot of changes lately.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.953
You, uh...

12:32.986 --> 12:34.521
you want to talk
about what's going on?

12:34.554 --> 12:36.556
Oh, no, Mother Darling.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.860
All that oxygen to the teeth
promotes decay.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.294
Shania...

12:41.328 --> 12:43.363
do you keep pretending
to be this "Evie" person

12:43.396 --> 12:45.232
because you think
it's not okay to be you?

12:45.265 --> 12:48.068
I don't know.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.002
(knocking on door)

12:49.036 --> 12:50.003
(splutters)

12:54.374 --> 12:55.976
Oh, hey.
Oh, hi.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.444
Did you guys
get the blood test results?

12:57.477 --> 12:58.946
Is that why you're here?

12:58.979 --> 13:00.247
DAVID:
No, no, no. Not yet.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.449
Sorry to just drop in.

13:02.482 --> 13:03.817
We'd say we were
in the neighborhood,

13:03.851 --> 13:05.385
but you'd
know we were lying.

13:05.418 --> 13:07.420
Hey, Shania,
who's your little friend?

13:07.454 --> 13:09.422
This is my pet raccoon Buster.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.391
He thrives on pâté.

13:11.424 --> 13:12.559
BRYAN:
Well, this place is like...

13:12.592 --> 13:16.196
Shabby Chic,
without all that pesky chic.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.565
Mother's trying hard
to find a style.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.100
It's truly astonishing
and abominable.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.035
That's Little Edie.
That's Little Edie.

13:22.069 --> 13:23.570
I thought you guys
were going out dancing.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.939
Oh, no, we actually
cut out early

13:25.973 --> 13:27.841
because we would like
to give you

13:27.875 --> 13:29.409
a little bit of
a housewarming gift.

13:29.442 --> 13:30.944
You guys didn't have to.

13:30.978 --> 13:33.380
You've already been
so good to us.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.248
Your housewarming gift is...

13:36.549 --> 13:38.818
a new house!

13:40.253 --> 13:42.389
They're in shock.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.623
I think they're in shock.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.892
It's our guest house.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.927
It's got two bedrooms.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.128
Full laundry.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.897
With a cotton candy maker.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.164
Well, yeah, what are we animals?

13:51.198 --> 13:52.565
Well, Nana says yes,
but I don't think so.

13:52.599 --> 13:53.600
Okay.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.402
DAVID:
Someone is always home

13:55.435 --> 13:57.871
so there's built-in
day care for Shania.

13:57.905 --> 13:58.906
Plus...

13:58.939 --> 14:01.508
it is rent-free.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.643
So all of your money
will go to your dream

14:03.676 --> 14:05.145
of law school.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.646
It's the perfect solution.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.082
Rust-free fixtures.

14:09.116 --> 14:10.918
With divine gay
bric-a-brac.

14:12.219 --> 14:14.487
No, I... don't get it.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.423
What do you guys
get out of it?

14:16.456 --> 14:18.992
We don't want you to feel like
you're out here all on your own.

14:19.026 --> 14:21.328
Can we stay, Mom?
Please, can we?

14:29.502 --> 14:31.604
Just one second.
I'm just breaking up

14:31.638 --> 14:34.174
my two lead characters
so I can start a Twitter riot.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.976
You think your mom
will let you stay?

14:36.009 --> 14:37.110
(normal voice):
Hope so.

14:37.144 --> 14:40.413
Done. Millions
of teen tears.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.916
But what would Little Edie
say? Wouldn't she say...

14:42.950 --> 14:45.118
(with Hepburn voice):
I hope the head on her shoulders

14:45.152 --> 14:47.587
is attached to the rest
of her body.

14:47.620 --> 14:48.588
She's not Kate Hepburn.

14:48.621 --> 14:49.689
What's wrong with you?

14:49.722 --> 14:51.191
Did something happen?

14:51.224 --> 14:53.360
I started my new school
this week.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.529
What's with the scarf?

14:56.563 --> 14:59.699
Going through chemo?
Or just Muslim?

14:59.732 --> 15:01.634
There's nothing worse than
dealing with a dogmatic female,

15:01.668 --> 15:02.970
I'm sure.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.139
Those kids don't get me at all.

15:06.173 --> 15:08.308
I know. When I was a kid,
nobody got me, either.

15:08.341 --> 15:09.476
Guys, guys!

15:09.509 --> 15:11.411
I've painstakingly recreated

15:11.444 --> 15:13.513
the entire Carrington
mansion from Dynasty

15:13.546 --> 15:15.448
out of Creamsicle sticks.
Check out the tiny

15:15.482 --> 15:17.684
reflection pool, it's perfect
for vicious cat fights.

15:21.621 --> 15:22.956
This might be
hard to believe, Shania,

15:22.990 --> 15:25.025
but I didn't always fit in
like I do now.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.559
I always felt different.
Just like you.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.228
My nana thinks I'm nuts,

15:28.261 --> 15:30.163
and my mom thinks
I'm acting crazy

15:30.197 --> 15:31.965
'cause of all
the changes going on,

15:31.999 --> 15:34.467
but this has always
just been me.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.204
Bryan, I'm a weirdo
and I don't want to be.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.172
I just want to be normal.

15:39.206 --> 15:42.009
What a stupid,
shortsighted wish.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.745
You don't know this yet,
but the most unique

15:45.778 --> 15:49.049
parts of you are also the ones
that will lead you to greatness.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.651
And to a chalet in Deer
Valley with direct slope access.

15:51.684 --> 15:54.521
How come you get me
but my own mom doesn't?

15:54.554 --> 15:56.589
Your mom may not
totally get you,

15:56.623 --> 15:58.558
but she lets you be who you are

15:58.591 --> 15:59.726
and she loves
you for it.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.694
Don't be afraid
to be who you are, Shania.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.596
'Cause you're spectacular.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.434
Except when you lie.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.602
Now, I need you
to finally cop

16:09.636 --> 16:13.140
to your act of
vandalism and apologize.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.142
(with accent): I didn't want
to be a tattletale,

16:15.175 --> 16:17.544
but us special people
got to stick together.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.579
Oh, she's back.
I wasn't the one

16:19.612 --> 16:21.514
who colored on your couch,
but I know who did.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.321
Damn, she's good.

16:28.355 --> 16:29.556
She wanted to turn me
against kids,

16:29.589 --> 16:30.557
so I'd get skittish
about this baby

16:30.590 --> 16:32.159
and forget about
the whole thing.

16:32.192 --> 16:35.128
Well, like it or not,
your nana is special, too.

16:35.162 --> 16:37.030
I mean, what the hell
else is she capable of?

16:37.064 --> 16:39.666
(with accent):
I mean, really.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.701
That was close.
No.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.611
Clay, what are you
doing here?

16:51.644 --> 16:53.113
We need to talk.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.582
Goldie, you... you look hot.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.317
Oh...

16:57.350 --> 17:00.187
But not hot-sweaty.
Come on, you got it, right?

17:00.220 --> 17:01.688
Yeah.
No, don't.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.456
Don't come any closer.
Babe, please...

17:03.490 --> 17:05.625
Come on, I miss you.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.194
I want us to be
a family again.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.396
It's all I want.
It's all I think about.

17:09.429 --> 17:12.232
Say, "I want us
to be a family again."

17:12.265 --> 17:13.733
Say, "It's all I want."

17:13.766 --> 17:15.202
Say, "It's all I think about."

17:15.235 --> 17:16.469
The "I" is me , right?

17:16.503 --> 17:19.406
Say, "That being without you
has made me change."

17:19.439 --> 17:22.109
Say, "It's made me want to grow
up." Say...

17:22.142 --> 17:24.711
Look, I know I messed up
real bad, but...

17:24.744 --> 17:26.313
I'll do anything.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.848
Everything to make it right.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.850
When you left, you took
a piece of my heart with you.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.485
See, when you left, you...

17:32.519 --> 17:35.088
you took a piece
of my heart with you, and...

17:35.122 --> 17:38.125
I just, I can't
live without it.

17:41.661 --> 17:44.264
But, um...

17:44.297 --> 17:47.434
all the lying
and the other girls...

17:47.467 --> 17:49.536
How am I ever supposed
to trust you again?

17:49.569 --> 17:50.637
JANE:
She's going to ask you

17:50.670 --> 17:51.538
about trust.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.240
Here's what you're gonna say.

17:53.273 --> 17:56.309
Say: "I'll do anything
to make you trust me.

17:56.343 --> 17:57.710
"I'm not myself.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.312
I'm a shell of a man..."

17:59.346 --> 18:02.315
*

18:04.717 --> 18:08.288
You are the stupidest person
alive.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.857
I don't know.
I can't remember that one.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.226
(gasps)

18:13.260 --> 18:15.495
I want a divorce.

18:15.528 --> 18:18.365
You want...
you want to dump me?

18:18.398 --> 18:20.433
That's cool.

18:22.802 --> 18:25.472
You know, I'm not ditching
Shania here.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.407
A girl needs a real man
in her life.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.576
Yeah, well, now she has two.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.379
Yeah, yeah.

18:36.183 --> 18:38.718
BRYAN:
Shania, we have to

18:38.751 --> 18:40.487
get you white heels.
I cannot believe this.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.189
I can't believe
I haven't seen this before.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.756
BRYAN:
This is the best part.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.292
Hey, you guys.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.693
DAVID: Oh, hey, come,
come, come, come.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.361
Uh, Shania,

18:48.395 --> 18:49.696
I talked to your dad.
He's gonna spend

18:49.729 --> 18:50.730
some time with you tomorrow.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.465
My dad's coming to L.A.?

18:52.499 --> 18:54.133
Yeah. Uh, but not here.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.803
To our place.

18:56.836 --> 18:59.506
So let's grab our stuff.
Let's go home.

18:59.539 --> 19:00.707
This is home.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.409
This is Bryan
and David's home.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.177
This is the life they earned.

19:04.211 --> 19:05.512
Not us.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.714
Yeah, but it would
really mean a lot to us

19:07.747 --> 19:09.182
for you both to stay.

19:09.216 --> 19:11.184
Um, I...

19:11.218 --> 19:12.619
We can't.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.721
I'm scared of getting
too comfortable.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.189
But isn't that a good thing?

19:16.223 --> 19:18.391
It's the worst.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.693
The boy I married
was four inches shorter

19:20.727 --> 19:22.329
than the husband I left.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.564
I mean, we both
weren't done growing yet.

19:24.597 --> 19:25.965
We lived with my nana,

19:25.998 --> 19:29.669
and we raised this
incredible daughter.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.471
And that life felt safe,
even though it wasn't.

19:31.504 --> 19:32.505
Maybe if I'd felt

19:32.539 --> 19:33.806
less comfortable,

19:33.840 --> 19:35.608
I wouldn't have wasted
so much time.

19:35.642 --> 19:36.943
What about me?

19:36.976 --> 19:38.411
What about what I need?

19:38.445 --> 19:39.912
Come here, baby.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.882
You...

19:42.915 --> 19:46.286
You are an old soul, Shania,

19:46.319 --> 19:48.821
but you're still just
my baby girl.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.324
It's important you see me
as an independent woman,

19:51.358 --> 19:53.893
so that, someday,
you can become one.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.330
You're so lucky, Shania.

19:57.364 --> 19:58.998
Your mom's one of
the special ones.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.701
Like you and me.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.603
And me.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.972
Yes, like you.
Of course, like you.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.307
Yeah.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.711
(phone rings)

20:15.615 --> 20:16.816
Hello.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.420
DAVID:
Uh-huh.

20:20.453 --> 20:23.323
Are you sure?

20:23.356 --> 20:25.625
You're sure.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.026
Okay.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.561
Thank you.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.303
We are officially pregnant.

20:38.638 --> 20:39.606
You know
what that means...

20:40.940 --> 20:42.475
Group hug!

20:42.509 --> 20:44.644
Come on.

20:44.677 --> 20:46.579
Come here.

20:46.613 --> 20:47.947
Oh!
