02:39.292 --> 02:40.892
Oh, shit.

03:07.086 --> 03:10.455
Thief? I'm from the
neighborhood. My mother-

03:10.457 --> 03:11.590
<i>makes a lousy ziti.</i>

03:11.592 --> 03:14.626
That class sucked.

03:15.561 --> 03:17.062
Guess you have to have
students call it a class-

03:17.064 --> 03:18.763
hello. My show.

03:18.765 --> 03:21.800
<i>People change,</i>
<i>you cross-eyed hump.</i>

03:21.802 --> 03:23.635
Maybe I should
make some flyers.

03:23.637 --> 03:26.104
You know, traditional dance
is not exactly an easy sell.

03:26.106 --> 03:27.606
You think?

03:27.608 --> 03:28.840
You wanna know why no one came?

03:28.842 --> 03:30.375
Because <i> mob hit</i> is on.

03:31.510 --> 03:34.679
Watch and learn how
to sell Italian culture.

03:36.248 --> 03:38.350
<i>Got a problem with it?</i>

03:38.352 --> 03:40.085
I gotta get changed.
Dad's picking me up.

03:40.087 --> 03:42.754
Oh, oh, my god,
did you hear his new horn?

03:42.756 --> 03:44.022
Why?

03:48.729 --> 03:50.295
Oh, I'm gonna be
late for this gig.

03:50.297 --> 03:52.864
Hey...

03:52.866 --> 03:54.566
Am I supposed
to know what that means?

03:54.568 --> 03:57.402
It means a whale's culo.
It's slang.

03:58.337 --> 04:00.171
It means good luck, dumb-ass.

04:01.207 --> 04:02.273
You're a weirdo.

04:02.275 --> 04:03.842
It really does.

04:05.311 --> 04:07.712
Bing it.

04:11.317 --> 04:14.252
What? The horn.
Godfather, really?

04:15.254 --> 04:15.253
It's an American classic.

04:15.255 --> 04:18.356
Not exactly Italian
pride at its best.

04:18.358 --> 04:19.290
An Italian wrote it.

04:19.291 --> 04:20.558
An Italian directed it.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.660
And people love "the godfather."

04:21.661 --> 04:23.228
Or what they get whacked?

04:23.230 --> 04:24.362
Cost a lot of money
to get the tuning right.

04:24.364 --> 04:26.264
You call that tuning?

04:27.366 --> 04:28.667
What's up with the cassette?

04:28.669 --> 04:30.101
And a boombox?

04:30.103 --> 04:31.936
What about the iPod
we got you last year?

04:31.938 --> 04:33.271
Tony knows a guy
that can hook it up.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.572
It didn't have Dean
Martin. What good is it?

04:34.574 --> 04:36.908
It doesn't come preloaded.

04:59.565 --> 05:01.199
What's this?

05:02.068 --> 05:03.902
Ain't no gas left.

05:03.904 --> 05:07.072
So you rented the
smallest vehicle ever.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.339
It's a convertible.

05:09.575 --> 05:11.209
Uh, where's Tony?

05:12.344 --> 05:13.511
You're late.

05:13.513 --> 05:14.746
I had a drop-off
for the restaurant.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.047
Besides I just saw your father.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.382
Where's the Van?

05:18.718 --> 05:20.351
Aw come on, Quenton.

05:20.353 --> 05:21.419
There's no back seat.

05:21.421 --> 05:22.353
Where's Frankie supposed to sit?

05:22.355 --> 05:23.588
Hilarious.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.256
This is gonna be fun.

05:27.460 --> 05:28.860
Oh fuck. What's going on?

05:28.862 --> 05:32.197
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

05:32.199 --> 05:33.832
Quenton you're such a pussy.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.200
That's so disgusting.

05:35.202 --> 05:36.568
What? What's this?

05:36.570 --> 05:38.269
Close it.

05:38.271 --> 05:39.671
Wait.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.307
Oh, good god.

05:42.309 --> 05:44.409
You saw the
bullet hole and everything?

05:44.411 --> 05:47.145
He was just so dead.

05:48.881 --> 05:51.583
Out of all the cars
you could have rented,

05:51.585 --> 05:52.851
it was mob.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.886
Did you see his St.
Christopher medal?

05:54.888 --> 05:56.755
Well, okay, well were
his eyes open or shut?

05:56.757 --> 05:58.189
I think they were open.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.091
Enough you guys.

06:00.793 --> 06:02.160
We're going to the funeral.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.662
Why? So you can just
fulfill your mob fantasies?

06:04.664 --> 06:06.364
You didn't see this guy.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.533
Exactly. That's
why we're going.

06:08.535 --> 06:09.968
You're not going.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.303
It's dangerous besides two
beautiful women show up.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.139
They're gonna think you're.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.206
Huh?

06:15.208 --> 06:16.941
You know, hookers.

06:16.943 --> 06:19.644
Oh, nice way to
talk about wifey.

06:19.646 --> 06:21.379
We're not even engaged yet.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.747
Don't tell my mom.

06:22.749 --> 06:25.183
She's already
planning the wedding.

06:25.185 --> 06:25.183
This morning,

06:25.185 --> 06:29.554
she asked if we wanted those
candied almonds on the table.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.289
Confetti?

06:31.291 --> 06:35.593
Confetti? Why would you
want confetti on the table?

06:35.595 --> 06:38.696
Confetti, the
candy-covered almonds.

06:38.698 --> 06:40.431
Oh, confetti's the almonds.

06:40.433 --> 06:42.300
Got it.

06:42.302 --> 06:44.169
We are so not Italian.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.354
What?

07:05.291 --> 07:09.661
What? Heather tells me,
all excited mind you,

07:09.663 --> 07:11.429
they're going to
this freaking wake.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.931
You're allowing this?

07:12.933 --> 07:14.332
Can I stop them from anything?

07:14.334 --> 07:16.301
They're adults. God forbid
they listen to me?

07:16.303 --> 07:18.870
Yeah, you realize
whose wake this is.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.839
Your eldest found the body.

07:20.841 --> 07:21.906
She's freaked to high heaven.

07:21.908 --> 07:23.541
You should have a word with her.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.477
How are you so calm about this?

07:26.479 --> 07:29.080
You know, hand to god, I
love those kids more than life,

07:29.082 --> 07:32.617
but this is not my
problem anymore.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.085
Anything happens
to them, so help me-

07:34.087 --> 07:36.254
yeah, we'll make
sure it doesn't.

07:39.225 --> 07:40.558
Thought you quit.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.927
- I did.
- - Yeah.

07:44.463 --> 07:46.364
Yeah.

08:05.117 --> 08:06.484
Where you two going?
You need invitations.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.685
To a wake?

08:07.687 --> 08:09.053
Listen beautiful,
I don't know you,

08:09.055 --> 08:10.955
and I don't know you.
Need an invite.

08:10.957 --> 08:12.023
That's ridiculous.

08:12.025 --> 08:15.260
Hey Oeldo.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.631
Don't be a dick.
These are friends of mine.

08:19.633 --> 08:20.932
From where?

08:20.934 --> 08:22.700
Oh, my sister's in a band.

08:22.702 --> 08:24.335
She comes to hear them play.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.503
Yeah, I bet she does.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.338
Come on.

08:34.078 --> 08:37.282
So you really play in a band?

08:37.284 --> 08:37.282
Yeah.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.918
Yeah, she has a gig tomorrow
night. You should come.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.785
Oh, play weddings?

08:41.788 --> 08:43.655
No.

08:44.790 --> 08:46.758
Well if you play the old stuff

08:46.760 --> 08:47.992
and want to make some money.

08:47.994 --> 08:50.295
Oh, you book wedding bands?

08:50.297 --> 08:53.831
Awesome. You can help find
a band for Frankie's wedding.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.033
You're engaged.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.402
- Not exactly, not yet.
- I see.

08:57.404 --> 09:00.004
I mean we've talked about it.
I sent him to look at the ring.

09:00.773 --> 09:02.540
You're choosing the ring?

09:02.542 --> 09:04.709
What? You work in weddings.
It's what people do now.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.511
It's called planning.

09:06.513 --> 09:09.580
Well, people also
plan their own funerals.

09:22.661 --> 09:23.962
What?

09:23.964 --> 09:25.063
This is just like
every other Italian wake

09:25.065 --> 09:27.231
I've ever been to.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.933
I'm sorry, how did
you guys know pinky?

09:28.935 --> 09:30.902
That's awesome.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.303
Is that his nickname?

09:32.305 --> 09:34.539
Did he get his pinkie's
chopped off or something?

09:34.940 --> 09:36.174
Look at that guy.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.042
He's like Vince
d'amico, only real.

09:38.044 --> 09:39.610
Jesus, Heather.

09:39.612 --> 09:40.812
You'll have to excuse my sister.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.747
She has these ideas
about the mafia.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.649
She's the one who found him.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.084
I wouldn't advertise that here.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.519
This isn't the type of
crowd that likes witnesses.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.355
Oh, smart.

09:51.357 --> 09:52.757
So you got a name?

09:52.759 --> 09:54.292
Frankie.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.426
Heather.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.128
My sister.

10:02.501 --> 10:03.601
You wanna fit in right?

10:03.603 --> 10:05.203
Yeah we do.

10:06.338 --> 10:07.672
Not really.

10:15.614 --> 10:16.814
Frankie and Heather,

10:16.816 --> 10:18.516
this is Caesar
Bellafusco, my father.

10:18.518 --> 10:19.517
Senora Montessaro.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.420
My deepest sympathies.

10:23.222 --> 10:24.856
Discust.

10:24.858 --> 10:25.990
What's this?

10:32.232 --> 10:35.033
I'm gonna give this to
my destiny foundation.

10:41.273 --> 10:42.673
Uh, hmm.

10:51.951 --> 10:52.950
Frankie.

10:52.952 --> 10:54.519
Mr. Roma.

10:55.387 --> 10:57.488
I told you my
girlfriend's in there.

10:57.941 --> 10:58.390
Hey.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.858
Well I bet you
know this guy too.

11:00.860 --> 11:02.427
No.

11:02.429 --> 11:02.427
Tony.

11:02.429 --> 11:07.065
Hey. I was
worried about you guys.

11:07.067 --> 11:10.268
Come on, I'll take you home.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.937
Hey come to the show,
little town in hoboken.

11:12.939 --> 11:15.206
Yeah, maybe.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.841
Thanks advertise where
I'll be just in case

11:16.843 --> 11:18.543
someone wants to kill me.

11:18.545 --> 11:21.345
Oh my god, I can't believe
you're better at this than me.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.224
Ledoux just sent these.

11:34.226 --> 11:36.794
Gagoot's at the wake.

11:41.600 --> 11:45.303
He's lucky Bellafusco
doesn't punch his ticker too.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.805
Bunch of gargons, swear to god.

11:53.879 --> 11:54.979
The girls?

11:54.981 --> 11:56.013
What?

11:56.015 --> 11:57.148
I don't know.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.950
Put a tail on them.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.685
Okay.

12:08.760 --> 12:10.995
Caesar.

12:10.997 --> 12:13.364
I heard you were gonna be here.

12:13.366 --> 12:16.834
I did my communion with
pinky that pencil prick.

12:16.836 --> 12:18.936
Look like it or not,
I gotta be here.

12:18.938 --> 12:21.072
Out of respect for the

12:21.074 --> 12:22.940
good thing I like old ladies.

12:22.942 --> 12:24.275
Yeah, you're a prince.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.410
You see those feds out front?

12:26.412 --> 12:29.113
Always looking for
the weak animal.

12:29.115 --> 12:31.415
Where's the loyalty?

12:32.151 --> 12:34.986
Even a traitor's lost Sonny.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.387
Just found some other loyalty.

12:36.389 --> 12:39.123
Kind of sounds
like an ex-wife, huh?

12:39.125 --> 12:43.294
Pinky took a shot at
me, not a smart man.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.129
So sure, where's the loyalty?

12:45.131 --> 12:49.167
What I gotta ask is who
gave him a better deal.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.736
Say hello to your father.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.476
Staten island too small for him?

12:58.478 --> 13:01.379
Keep an eye on that
ferry-riding fuck.

13:02.080 --> 13:05.583
Yeah sure.

13:05.585 --> 13:09.220
Thanks, by the way, for
showing up at that wake.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.421
It was so awkward.

13:10.423 --> 13:13.224
We didn't need you, but thanks.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.526
I'm always gonna be
there for you, Frankie.

13:18.330 --> 13:20.331
Seriously, Frankie.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.699
What is up with you?

13:21.701 --> 13:23.701
I wanted to wait for
a more special time, but

13:23.703 --> 13:29.440
you just make things,
I don't know, right.

13:30.509 --> 13:32.476
You get me.

13:32.478 --> 13:32.476
I do?

13:32.478 --> 13:38.816
Francesca del Vecchio,
will you marry me?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.585
You've been talking the ring.

13:45.123 --> 13:46.857
Are you gonna answer me?

13:46.859 --> 13:48.125
Yes, Tony, yes.

13:54.499 --> 13:55.800
You know when we're married,

13:55.802 --> 13:57.935
I can focus on the
things that I wanna do.

13:57.937 --> 13:59.103
I mean the business for one.

13:59.105 --> 14:00.504
Starting that frozen food line.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.474
With you by my side,
anything is possible.

14:04.142 --> 14:06.110
Your anything is frozen food?

14:06.112 --> 14:08.512
I'm thinking long term.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.181
Well I'm not
givin' up my music.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.451
Not today, but we all
gotta give up something.

14:13.453 --> 14:16.354
We gotta find out
together dream.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.922
Oh, hey, we better get goin.

14:17.924 --> 14:20.124
Well, what's the rush?

14:20.126 --> 14:21.626
Uh, the run-through?

14:21.628 --> 14:24.195
I promised Carlos I'd sub
at the restaurant. I told you.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.963
You absolutely did not tell me,

14:25.965 --> 14:29.934
or I would have rescheduled
rehearsal for like you know now.

14:29.936 --> 14:32.470
But then we
wouldn't be engaged.

14:35.507 --> 14:37.875
Probably should start looking
for a new lead guitarist anyway.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.645
Gonna have to give up
that pipe dream someday.

14:40.647 --> 14:43.381
At least now I still
have other dreams.

14:44.082 --> 14:45.716
Well I don't.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.351
You got me.

15:00.465 --> 15:02.033
What're you lookin' at?

15:03.869 --> 15:05.336
Now that's a prayer card.

15:05.338 --> 15:06.837
Italian's, we know how to
do funerals, all right.

15:06.839 --> 15:10.174
Oh yeah, we really corner
the market on that one.

15:10.176 --> 15:11.809
Hey, I'm proud of my heritage.

15:11.811 --> 15:14.078
Yeah, I don't have to
advertise it on my car.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.446
And I didn't need
to stand in the park

15:15.448 --> 15:17.315
for half a day doing
yoga with the Chinese.

15:17.317 --> 15:21.319
It's tai chi, and
they're not all Chinese.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.154
I'm glad you two got divorced.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.455
Really eased up on arguing.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.290
Your father doesn't
argue, he obfuscates.

15:26.292 --> 15:27.958
I don't even know
what that means.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.694
Get married. You'll learn.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.762
Don't we have any
mafia in the family,

15:31.764 --> 15:34.465
like I don't know, a
distant cousin or something?

15:36.001 --> 15:36.901
Did you tell her?

15:36.903 --> 15:38.069
What we do?

15:38.071 --> 15:39.637
- No!
- - No!

15:39.639 --> 15:41.105
Look, I think what
your mother is trying to say

15:41.107 --> 15:42.506
is that if this
ever happens again-

15:42.508 --> 15:44.075
what do you mean
if it happens again?

15:44.077 --> 15:45.543
Could happen.

15:45.545 --> 15:46.977
Let's just say no more
funerals of this nature, okay?

15:46.979 --> 15:48.779
You've gone. You've
satisfied your curiosity.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.014
Let's leave it at that.

15:50.016 --> 15:51.515
Thank you.

15:51.517 --> 15:54.318
I gotta ask though, what
do you estimate the casket?

15:54.320 --> 15:55.486
Three grand?

15:55.488 --> 15:56.887
You think I was
lookin' at the casket?

15:56.889 --> 15:58.656
Which reminds
me that plot you have,

15:58.658 --> 16:00.825
you can bury whoever
you want there.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.159
I'm gonna be cremated.

16:02.161 --> 16:03.394
What the hell are
you talking about?

16:03.396 --> 16:04.962
Ash is for Wednesday.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.997
I gotta go the rest of my life
wondering if your dead body

16:06.999 --> 16:08.332
is smeared on my forehead?

16:08.334 --> 16:10.134
They're from palms.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.503
Enough already.
Divorced. Remember?

16:12.505 --> 16:15.172
Could it be any more
obvious why? Huh?

16:15.174 --> 16:17.441
Why we got divorced.

16:19.010 --> 16:20.010
Was she Italian?

16:20.012 --> 16:22.580
Really? Parents.

16:22.582 --> 16:23.781
You're the ones who
taught me to hide anything

16:23.783 --> 16:25.182
that might shame
me in the morning.

16:25.184 --> 16:27.017
Practice what you preach.

16:28.353 --> 16:29.854
I'm keeping this.

16:33.859 --> 16:36.360
Hey, how was rehearsal?

16:36.362 --> 16:38.996
Awful. I had to
play lead guitar.

16:38.998 --> 16:42.066
Baby, I'm working here,
not messing around on you.

16:42.068 --> 16:43.334
I know. Sorry.

16:43.336 --> 16:48.873
Ooh, what a day. Whoo.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.245
Come here.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.480
Hey, your aunts out there.

16:56.482 --> 16:57.915
You tell her yet?

17:00.820 --> 17:03.154
Come on. Show them show them.

17:03.156 --> 17:04.588
Oh, oh, oh, god
I was at rehearsal.

17:04.589 --> 17:07.023
I'm not used to it yet.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.492
- Yeah.
- Nice.

17:08.493 --> 17:10.861
I'm so sorry we don't
have time to celebrate.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.665
You'll see when you
with Tony and Ronan.

17:14.666 --> 17:17.867
Hey, let them
get married first.

17:17.869 --> 17:21.605
Oh, this is the most
beautiful time for you.

17:21.607 --> 17:24.241
This and when you get pregnant.

17:24.242 --> 17:26.444
I think we're gonna wait.

17:27.212 --> 17:29.914
Ah, nah, that's
what they all say.

17:29.916 --> 17:34.552
Now, when you are
a good catholic.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.387
These things, they just come.

17:39.459 --> 17:40.958
Alright, oh.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.726
We just so happy.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.195
See and when we do have kids,

17:44.197 --> 17:45.596
I want them to
know their culture.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.698
This girl's gonna make
such a good Italian wife.

17:47.700 --> 17:47.698
Viva Italia.

17:47.700 --> 17:51.402
Hey, pop, the whole world
isn't Italia, Italia, Italia.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.903
- Leave him alone.
- Hey!

17:52.905 --> 17:54.438
Hey you won't make
a good Italian wife

17:54.440 --> 17:55.473
if you disagree with me.

17:55.475 --> 17:55.473
Please if that's the case,

17:55.475 --> 17:58.776
I won't make a good
Italian wife period.

17:58.778 --> 18:02.947
Ooh. Nice, smarty pantses.

18:09.654 --> 18:10.688
What?

18:10.690 --> 18:12.256
The toilet's not working.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.324
Just close the lid.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.892
Ew! Can you ask Tony?

18:14.894 --> 18:16.961
What do you do if a
toilet's not running?

18:16.963 --> 18:18.863
- Turn the.
- Turn the

18:18.865 --> 18:20.130
- water on.
- - Water on.

18:20.132 --> 18:21.298
Nicolette?

18:21.300 --> 18:23.067
I'll see you inside,
and let me know

18:23.069 --> 18:25.436
if you have another
plumbing emergency.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.137
<i>Frankie.</i>

18:28.907 --> 18:29.874
<i>Frankie!</i>

18:29.876 --> 18:31.141
Turn the water on.

18:31.143 --> 18:32.543
What was that?

18:32.545 --> 18:34.778
Can we just get
the trunk unloaded?

18:52.163 --> 18:53.397
Come on you giving
me indigestion

18:53.399 --> 18:54.665
just watching you
for Christ's sake.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.667
What's the matter
with you tonight?

18:59.371 --> 19:00.971
Guess who I am now?

19:02.474 --> 19:06.443
Hmm? Godfather or mob hit?

19:06.445 --> 19:09.146
Every time you suck on an orange,
we gotta talk about this?

19:09.148 --> 19:11.282
Come on, d'Amico's a pansy.

19:12.183 --> 19:13.350
You gotta problem with it?

19:13.352 --> 19:14.885
You gotta problem with it?

19:15.787 --> 19:17.855
Imagine Brando saying it.

19:21.654 --> 19:23.061
That's what I'm saying.

19:23.062 --> 19:26.897
Everything sounds better
when Brando says it.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.100
Got enough food there, Lou?

19:30.102 --> 19:31.769
Yep.

19:32.470 --> 19:33.437
I don't get this place.

19:33.439 --> 19:34.471
What's to get?

19:34.473 --> 19:35.606
Business with no hassles.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.308
Somewhere to meet and greet.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.742
Open up a sandwich shop.

19:38.744 --> 19:41.045
This place don't look
so hassle-free to me.

19:41.047 --> 19:44.915
My father god bless,
if he was still alive,

19:44.917 --> 19:46.617
imagine him walking
into some Mexican joint?

19:46.619 --> 19:48.185
Forget about it.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.454
Tapas, it's a tapas joint.

19:50.456 --> 19:52.222
What does that mean?
Can't get full?

19:52.224 --> 19:55.225
Hey I got a real spaniard
in the kitchen from Spain.

19:55.227 --> 19:56.827
This ain't TV.

19:56.829 --> 19:59.330
We need to keep our noses clean.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.734
I know it ain't easy to
take, but your old man

20:03.736 --> 20:05.703
was like a father to me.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.772
On his deathbed,
who does he ask for?

20:08.774 --> 20:13.177
His nephew, so bravo,
you're the boss.

20:13.179 --> 20:18.015
I'm living with it, but it's
like my father slapped my face.

20:20.553 --> 20:24.321
He loved you Lou, and I
can't say it more plainly,

20:24.323 --> 20:25.889
business is business.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.659
So come on, have another drink.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.160
Want some more food?

20:30.162 --> 20:31.662
Want some dessert?

20:32.731 --> 20:33.764
Hi Caesar.

20:33.766 --> 20:35.265
I love this place.

20:35.267 --> 20:36.934
Even their
bathrooms are done by artists.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.636
What's with the toilet fetish?

20:38.638 --> 20:40.904
Nothing, I had
some problems, alright?

20:43.642 --> 20:48.479

atavistic altos, thank you.

21:28.820 --> 21:31.121
Buy the band a beer or seven.

21:40.865 --> 21:45.636
Seriously, you guys like
rocked, and you, so sexy.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.772
You'd kill on <i> American idol.</i>

21:48.774 --> 21:49.873
But you know what, you guys
should seriously consider

21:49.875 --> 21:51.108
closing with a classic.

21:51.110 --> 21:52.209
I don't know, like
Sinatra or something.

21:52.211 --> 21:53.410
What?

21:53.412 --> 21:54.745
You're in Jersey.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.880
Or you could close with
an Italian folk song.

21:56.882 --> 21:58.816
I have this Cuban
friend who kills

21:58.818 --> 22:00.584
with guantanamera at
the end of her set.

22:00.586 --> 22:02.119
We're rock.

22:02.121 --> 22:04.588
She's rock. You have
to spice it up a bit.

22:04.590 --> 22:06.190
Don't think she didn't try.

22:06.192 --> 22:09.760
Oh my god, she had an
accordion one night, remember?

22:09.762 --> 22:11.628
So please, don't
encourage the ethnic.

22:11.630 --> 22:12.796
It nearly sank us.

22:12.798 --> 22:14.431
It wasn't that bad.

22:15.266 --> 22:16.200
You want ethnic?

22:16.202 --> 22:17.234
No.

22:17.236 --> 22:17.234
Here we go.

22:17.236 --> 22:20.637
I have a contact on mob
hit if you guys want a gig.

22:20.639 --> 22:22.139
Thanks, but no thanks.

22:22.141 --> 22:24.108
I think someone needs to
protect the Italian heritage.

22:24.110 --> 22:25.409
Are you serious?

22:25.411 --> 22:26.944
The Italian heritage
is in Italy.

22:26.946 --> 22:29.279
- I'd do it.
- In a heartbeat.

22:29.281 --> 22:31.048
What?

22:31.050 --> 22:31.048
I got nothing.

22:31.050 --> 22:34.485
Come on, you must
have a little something

22:34.487 --> 22:36.887
in order to reel this one in.

22:36.889 --> 22:40.491
Hey, you were amazing.

22:40.493 --> 22:43.460
Oh, thanks.

22:43.462 --> 22:44.895
Did you hear
what they say about

22:44.897 --> 22:48.198
everyone wanting
to fuck a rock star?

22:48.200 --> 22:49.900
Let's go.

22:55.173 --> 22:57.174
<i>You are an important person.</i>

22:57.176 --> 23:00.043
<i>You are in control</i>
<i>of your destin-</i>

23:01.246 --> 23:04.114
Mr. b, one of the
girls left you her card.

23:17.629 --> 23:20.030
That'd be gagoots.

23:20.032 --> 23:21.632
Saw the way he was
looking at me at the wake.

23:21.634 --> 23:22.833
I should have dropped
him right there.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.835
Oh, whoa, you got proof?

23:24.837 --> 23:26.503
Hey maybe it's him,
maybe it's not him.

23:26.505 --> 23:28.839
There are lots of folks
challenging power these days,

23:28.841 --> 23:30.440
especially new power.

23:30.442 --> 23:31.708
You know sun tzu says-

23:31.710 --> 23:33.310
he can kiss my tush.

23:33.312 --> 23:35.779
I don't need my after dinner
mint to be made of lead.

23:35.781 --> 23:37.381
I'll take care of it.

23:58.002 --> 23:59.403
See ya.

24:17.389 --> 24:19.423
You got something to say?

24:22.927 --> 24:25.596
If I did I woulda
said it 25 years ago.

24:26.865 --> 24:28.832
Shoulda been me you know.

24:28.834 --> 24:30.000
Comes time for a new boss,

24:30.002 --> 24:31.935
just saying, it shoulda been me.

24:32.837 --> 24:35.072
Remember to pick up
the sausage tomorrow.

25:04.402 --> 25:05.903
Oh shit.

25:08.373 --> 25:10.941
So uh, Carlos
knows a guy, Arturo,

25:10.943 --> 25:13.510
who's gonna help me hit
the frozen food angle

25:13.512 --> 25:15.112
from a whole new direction.

25:15.114 --> 25:17.948
Basically brand the food I've
eaten for my entire life.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.384
Did you hear what I just said?

25:20.386 --> 25:22.085
Yeah, mob hit.

25:22.087 --> 25:23.620
I have no idea if
your new friend

25:23.622 --> 25:25.055
had anything to do with it.

25:25.057 --> 25:27.324
I mean, she just
mentioned it last night.

25:28.359 --> 25:30.193
She's a whore, but even
she can't move that fast.

25:30.195 --> 25:31.795
All right, all right, I get it.

25:31.797 --> 25:32.930
You don't like her.

25:32.932 --> 25:34.197
I don't trust her.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.832
Like's got nothing
to do with it.

25:35.834 --> 25:37.601
Any other show,
and I'd be there,

25:37.603 --> 25:39.836
but this one, I gotta say no.

25:39.838 --> 25:41.672
It's your career.

25:41.674 --> 25:45.509
Which is apparently less
interesting than frozen food.

25:45.511 --> 25:47.678
Come on, I was listening.

25:51.482 --> 25:52.616
Good news?

25:52.618 --> 25:54.084
Oh now he's listening.

25:54.086 --> 25:55.485
Relax it's a girl.

25:55.487 --> 25:58.388
Babe, I was listening
the whole time.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.490
Okay?

26:00.492 --> 26:01.725
Get back to your silverware.

26:01.727 --> 26:03.060
Alright.

26:13.471 --> 26:14.604
Hey.

26:17.842 --> 26:19.710
I wasn't sure if
you were coming.

26:19.712 --> 26:22.079
I wasn't sure myself.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.947
You're cleaning the patio.

26:23.949 --> 26:25.916
Does that mean there's no lunch?

26:30.789 --> 26:32.322
Come on.

26:33.925 --> 26:35.192
You're probably
right about finding

26:35.194 --> 26:37.060
a sicilian song to close with.

26:37.062 --> 26:40.364
I'm just paranoid
since it bombed.

26:40.366 --> 26:42.466
Well I'm not talking
three songs here.

26:42.468 --> 26:43.767
I'm just talking one.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.135
And a short one at that.

26:45.137 --> 26:47.471
And you know you
could try a fun song,

26:47.473 --> 26:49.406
but with sicilians,
you're probably better off

26:49.408 --> 26:52.743
sticking with romantic
notions of invasion and death.

26:53.879 --> 26:55.612
Nobody'll understand
the words, just

26:55.614 --> 26:57.014
find a good beat.

26:57.016 --> 27:00.650
I got a letter from mob
hit asking me to audition.

27:00.652 --> 27:02.019
Seemed a little suspicious.

27:02.021 --> 27:04.755
If you're asking did
I recommend you, yes.

27:04.757 --> 27:06.623
But you just saw me play.

27:06.625 --> 27:10.260
So? I knew you were quality
the first moment that we met.

27:10.262 --> 27:12.863
And if I'm being totally honest,

27:12.865 --> 27:14.231
I'd like to get you out there.

27:14.233 --> 27:17.868
I don't think that's
such a good idea.

27:24.108 --> 27:26.009
I have no idea
what you just said,

27:26.011 --> 27:28.879
but it sounded nice.

27:28.881 --> 27:31.715
I said that I was
joking, and the rest is

27:31.717 --> 27:34.418
just what's right
in front of you.

27:45.363 --> 27:48.065
So you wanna talk
about the wedding, eh?

27:49.700 --> 27:51.168
Getting cold feet Francesca?

27:51.170 --> 27:53.670
Uh, yeah. Um, no.

27:55.807 --> 27:56.740
It's huge, right?

27:56.742 --> 27:58.708
Committing to someone.

27:58.710 --> 28:02.679
Up to now, Tony and I shared
our dreams with each other, but

28:02.681 --> 28:05.715
we never had a shared dream.

28:05.717 --> 28:07.150
You know what I mean?

28:07.718 --> 28:09.286
No, not exactly.

28:09.288 --> 28:12.923
Like, I had a dream
about being on the cover

28:12.925 --> 28:15.826
of a chart-topping album, and

28:15.828 --> 28:19.930
Tony, he has a dream about
his mug on a box of lasagna

28:19.932 --> 28:21.398
in somebody's freezer.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.266
That's weird, right?

28:23.268 --> 28:25.936
Well, do you feel like
there's room for both?

28:25.938 --> 28:27.204
I just don't wanna
wake up one day

28:27.206 --> 28:29.473
without a dream of my own.

28:30.842 --> 28:33.710
Then don't ever stop dreaming.

28:34.812 --> 28:36.613
It's not that easy.

28:36.615 --> 28:38.582
This friend of mine wants
me to audition for mob hits,

28:38.584 --> 28:41.218
which I know would be amazing
exposure for the band,

28:41.220 --> 28:42.652
- but-
- Have you heard?

28:42.654 --> 28:44.955
We have some of the cast
members for our parade.

28:44.957 --> 28:46.756
That's great, right?

28:46.758 --> 28:48.925
No.

28:48.927 --> 28:52.762
No? But I wanna
involve the young people,

28:52.764 --> 28:54.164
and this is what they enjoy.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.732
That's the problem.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.033
What kind of
message does it send

28:57.035 --> 28:59.136
that Italians worship
murderers and thieves?

28:59.138 --> 29:03.573
Christ himself embraced
murderers and thieves.

29:03.575 --> 29:07.210
Jesus forgives
mobsters, Frankie.

29:07.845 --> 29:09.246
And so should you.

29:24.896 --> 29:26.863
Ma.

29:29.267 --> 29:33.603
Uh, this is my Japanese
cooking instructor.

29:33.605 --> 29:37.274
Just getting a little
rice off your lip?

29:37.276 --> 29:38.608
I'll let myself out.

29:38.610 --> 29:41.378
Okay.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.714
You hungry?

29:44.716 --> 29:47.450
No.

29:47.452 --> 29:49.753
You know when a kid tells
an Italian mother no,

29:49.755 --> 29:51.421
she feeds 'em anyway, right?

29:51.423 --> 29:52.923
Why?

29:52.925 --> 29:54.057
Because she's
an Italian mother.

29:54.059 --> 29:55.458
That's what she does.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.893
Baby, I know you're
trying to find your roots

29:56.895 --> 30:01.231
and all that, but this
Italian mother is tired, so

30:01.233 --> 30:02.465
if you say you're not hungry,

30:02.467 --> 30:03.867
I meant good.

30:06.537 --> 30:08.338
I thought you said
you weren't hungry.

30:10.741 --> 30:12.909
You said you were tired.

30:19.684 --> 30:22.886
Oh, I cannot believe she

30:22.888 --> 30:25.689
who? That singer?

30:25.691 --> 30:26.823
Frankie, yes.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.258
That would be her name.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.393
You're banging her?

30:30.395 --> 30:33.163
I'm banging, what?
I'm banging her, really?

30:33.165 --> 30:35.398
No, vin, she's just
talented, okay?

30:35.400 --> 30:37.701
She could use a little push
in the right direction.

30:39.103 --> 30:41.404
What? She's engaged.

30:41.406 --> 30:43.640
Since when's that
ever stopped you, Nikki?

30:43.642 --> 30:47.377
Yeah, but you know,
this one's different.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.713
How about getting your
father to come to set?

30:49.715 --> 30:51.114
You think I can get the
real stuff from a book?

30:51.116 --> 30:52.182
Can you stop whining?

30:52.184 --> 30:53.283
You know I hate whiners.

30:53.285 --> 30:54.417
Everybody hates whiners.

30:54.419 --> 30:55.986
You're whining.
That's what you do.

30:55.988 --> 30:57.487
You whine, and you know what,

30:57.489 --> 31:00.357
I honestly don't know how
you pull it off on set.

31:01.392 --> 31:03.393
But I do right? Right?

31:04.495 --> 31:06.363
Right?

31:06.365 --> 31:07.864
Can you give her
another shot or what?

31:09.767 --> 31:13.570
Yeah, probably, I'll
see what I can do.

31:13.572 --> 31:17.207
See? Doesn't it feel good
helping out other people?

31:17.209 --> 31:19.142
Like you'd know.

31:19.144 --> 31:21.544
Shut up. Thank you.

31:22.813 --> 31:23.847
I wasn't whining.

31:23.849 --> 31:24.914
Still whining.

31:24.916 --> 31:25.982
No, I'm not whining.

31:25.984 --> 31:27.517
- Whining.
- I'm not whining.

31:27.519 --> 31:29.219
Whining!

31:29.221 --> 31:31.755
A little more of that
olive oil bronze please.

31:38.462 --> 31:40.897
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:43.067 --> 31:45.201
Um, thanks for meeting me.

31:45.203 --> 31:47.103
Yeah, sure, what's going on?

31:47.105 --> 31:48.772
I just talked to
my friend at mob hit.

31:48.774 --> 31:50.373
He said that he'll forget that
you turned down the audition

31:50.375 --> 31:52.309
and give you another
shot if you'll take it.

31:52.311 --> 31:54.778
What part of no aren't
you getting? The n or the o?

31:54.780 --> 31:57.113
Frankie, it's a really
great opportunity.

31:57.115 --> 31:58.381
National exposure.

31:58.383 --> 32:00.050
I think that you should take it.

32:01.285 --> 32:02.652
Look, I brought you a DVD.

32:02.654 --> 32:05.422
Have you ever seen
the show? Ever?

32:11.429 --> 32:13.330
Knowledge is power, Frankie.

32:28.212 --> 32:31.414
Whoa, are we tailing
her or her ass, ledoux?

32:32.583 --> 32:34.617
You know who she is, right?

32:34.619 --> 32:37.087
Yes, I know who she is,
which is why I'm confused.

32:37.089 --> 32:38.488
These two girls hanging out.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.690
I don't know. Something's fishy.

32:41.959 --> 32:43.193
Pig.

32:43.195 --> 32:44.928
What?

32:44.930 --> 32:46.130
No, I didn't mean it that way.

32:46.131 --> 32:47.263
I meant it the regular way,

32:47.265 --> 32:48.698
but that's funny though, fishy.

32:48.700 --> 32:51.401
Yeah, you know about
fishy, bumping uglies.

32:51.403 --> 32:54.404
You've gotta be
kiddin' me. Come on!

32:54.406 --> 32:57.273
What you need a little love
injection there, ledoux?

32:57.275 --> 32:58.641
Huh? Let me ask you a question.

32:58.643 --> 33:00.443
Are you the lipstick
or the dipstick?

33:00.445 --> 33:02.379
Okay. You gonna go grab
her up or you gonna sit there

33:02.381 --> 33:03.780
and wet-nurse your balls all
day?

33:03.782 --> 33:05.515
I might sit here and
wet-nurse my balls all day.

33:05.517 --> 33:06.883
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah you're on the clock.

33:06.885 --> 33:08.618
Get out.

33:10.921 --> 33:14.758
Hey you. Excuse me, FBI,
can you get in the car please.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.860
No way pervert.

33:19.730 --> 33:22.298
Nice jacket.

33:22.300 --> 33:24.901
Hey, ledoux.

33:26.071 --> 33:27.737
Thank you.

33:35.579 --> 33:38.047
Francesca del Vecchio.

33:40.618 --> 33:42.452
A little odd, don't you think?

33:42.454 --> 33:45.321
You find the body,
then go to the wake.

33:45.323 --> 33:47.390
Show up buddy, buddy
with the daughter

33:47.392 --> 33:48.958
of the new jefe in Brooklyn.

33:48.960 --> 33:52.295
Don't you mean capo di
capio or don or I don't know

33:52.297 --> 33:53.897
something Italian?

33:53.899 --> 33:54.964
We're watching you.

33:54.966 --> 33:56.166
Yep.

33:56.168 --> 33:58.168
Hope you enjoy the show.

34:08.813 --> 34:10.346
You're buggin' me
at home, what is it?

34:10.348 --> 34:12.181
Listen, we're having
a problem with tom.

34:12.184 --> 34:13.483
I know like 20 Toms.

34:13.485 --> 34:14.684
You know Tommy one-nut.

34:14.686 --> 34:15.784
Tommy one-nut from Brooklyn?

34:15.786 --> 34:16.953
Or Tommy one-nut from the Bronx?

34:16.955 --> 34:18.487
Who's Tommy one-nut
from the Bronx?

34:18.489 --> 34:19.789
For fuck's sake.

34:19.791 --> 34:22.425
Whoa. Bad enough we
got a guy with one nut.

34:22.427 --> 34:25.527
So, Tommy from Brooklyn,
who's an acorn short,

34:25.530 --> 34:26.696
what about him?

34:26.697 --> 34:28.297
He wrote a check
he can't even cash

34:28.300 --> 34:29.498
for Lou

34:29.501 --> 34:30.500
Lou took his action?

34:30.502 --> 34:32.335
I just said that.

34:32.337 --> 34:34.036
So no action, alright?

34:34.039 --> 34:35.405
Yeah, alright.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.072
Not unless that
jerkoff gets straight.

34:37.074 --> 34:39.275
- I said alright.
- Listen we're getting hungry.

34:39.277 --> 34:40.777
Where can we get some cavatells?

34:40.779 --> 34:42.545
You can't start a fart around
this neighborhood without

34:42.547 --> 34:43.880
hitting a fusion place.

34:43.882 --> 34:45.547
Yeah, look what they
done to that pizza grotto.

34:45.550 --> 34:48.117
Vindaloo pizza my ass.

34:48.119 --> 34:50.520
Disgusting.

34:52.822 --> 34:54.924
Green olives and black olives.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.928
What's going on?

34:58.930 --> 35:00.997
You seem like you're
in another world today.

35:00.999 --> 35:00.997
No I'm fine.

35:00.999 --> 35:04.567
Oh hey, can you bring the big
muff pedal to rehearsal later?

35:04.569 --> 35:06.436
Yeah, but I'm gonna be late.

35:06.438 --> 35:07.904
Again?

35:07.906 --> 35:09.572
You saw that gluten free
shit, I gotta talk to a guy.

35:09.574 --> 35:11.140
- I got.
- - Ah, yeah, yeah,

35:11.142 --> 35:12.976
how 'bout you just
kiss my big muff pedals?

35:25.256 --> 35:27.223
Lina.

35:29.160 --> 35:30.960
Enjoy. Sit. Sit.

35:33.063 --> 35:36.599
Hi, ladies. Can I get
you something to start?

35:37.501 --> 35:39.836
Big muffs.

35:41.405 --> 35:43.706
Hey.

35:50.080 --> 35:53.016
Yo, you guys must be
so stoked about mob hit.

35:53.018 --> 35:54.617
- What?
- Yeah!

35:54.619 --> 35:56.419
No I turned them down, I was-

35:56.421 --> 35:58.755
no, at it, you can suck my

35:58.757 --> 36:02.058
with your anti-defamation
bullshit already.

36:02.060 --> 36:04.227
- What did he call me?
- Camille paglia, maybe?

36:04.229 --> 36:05.429
Give me something to call him.

36:07.532 --> 36:09.032
Frank, pussy.

36:09.034 --> 36:10.166
He called me a pussy?

36:10.168 --> 36:11.601
Yeah.

36:11.603 --> 36:13.283
- Go fuck yourself.
- Yeah I know that one.

36:57.247 --> 36:58.781
You don't remember me, do you?

36:59.550 --> 37:04.087
<i>♪ Always sunlight on my face</i>

37:07.424 --> 37:12.695
<i>♪it feels so good</i>
<i>don't you know</i>

37:16.234 --> 37:18.968
<i>♪I can see heaven</i>

37:21.271 --> 37:23.606
oh, fuck

37:23.608 --> 37:28.244
<i>♪no matter what you will go</i>

37:28.246 --> 37:29.278
I have not been out to the

37:29.280 --> 37:30.647
rockaways since hurricane Sandy.

37:30.649 --> 37:31.981
This is crazy.

37:31.983 --> 37:34.784
Yeah, you think things
will last forever.

37:34.786 --> 37:37.053
I guess it leaves
space for something new.

37:37.055 --> 37:40.690
Mhmm.

37:40.692 --> 37:43.526
So the feast, I heard that
you're doing a dance class.

37:43.528 --> 37:45.261
Yeah, the pizzica di cuore.

37:45.263 --> 37:48.231
Ah, pizzica from the heart.

37:48.233 --> 37:49.265
You know it?

37:49.267 --> 37:50.733
Yeah, of course I do.

37:50.735 --> 37:53.369
At the end of the dance the
woman gives her scarf to

37:53.371 --> 37:55.004
whoever steals her heart.

37:57.908 --> 37:59.475
So my mom's got a
birthday coming up,

37:59.477 --> 38:01.878
and I don't know
what to get her.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.046
I want it to be meaningful.

38:03.048 --> 38:04.847
You know to say
something about us.

38:04.849 --> 38:07.750
Okay. So what's the
first thing you think of

38:07.752 --> 38:09.085
when I say family?

38:09.087 --> 38:10.953
Having dinner on
the table, I guess.

38:10.955 --> 38:14.323
Everyone laughing,
a big pan of lasagna.

38:14.325 --> 38:16.859
Ah, that's my mom's best dish.

38:17.895 --> 38:19.228
What's your favorite?

38:19.230 --> 38:20.663
Piece? The corner.

38:20.665 --> 38:23.299
Of course it is.
The driest slice.

38:24.334 --> 38:26.169
- That's it.
- What?

38:26.171 --> 38:28.337
That's the gift.

38:28.339 --> 38:30.039
You get her the best
lasagna pan money can buy,

38:30.041 --> 38:31.574
and then write her
a card and tell her

38:31.576 --> 38:33.109
exactly what you just told me.

38:33.111 --> 38:35.144
But she hasn't made
lasagna in like a year.

38:35.146 --> 38:38.081
Yeah, but it's the
thought that counts.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.348
True.

38:39.350 --> 38:42.418
Eh, it's what I would do
if it was my mom anyway.

38:45.022 --> 38:47.223
So why is that?

38:47.225 --> 38:50.326
Just think it's
important, you know, family.

38:51.895 --> 38:53.996
Hey can I ask you something?

38:53.998 --> 38:55.131
Yeah.

38:55.133 --> 38:57.066
What's it like?

38:57.068 --> 39:00.970
Growing up in a family
that's in the life.

39:00.972 --> 39:06.242
What are you talking
about isn't your-

39:06.244 --> 39:09.512
so when did you get into the
whole Italian pride thing?

39:09.514 --> 39:10.580
Was it always that way?

39:10.582 --> 39:11.781
What way?

39:11.783 --> 39:12.749
Alright, alright.

39:16.386 --> 39:18.321
After my dad left, maybe.

39:18.323 --> 39:19.655
I get it.

39:19.657 --> 39:21.858
When you miss somebody,
sometimes it's

39:21.860 --> 39:24.060
but think about why.

39:29.967 --> 39:32.068
Can't believe the
boardwalk's gone.

39:32.070 --> 39:34.170
I know.

39:40.844 --> 39:44.380
<i>♪I've been mixing</i>
<i>hope and doubt</i>

39:44.382 --> 39:49.886
<i>♪I've been changing</i>
<i>and I don't how</i>

39:55.459 --> 39:56.793
it's pretty.

39:56.795 --> 39:58.060
Well minus the somethings.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.630
What? I love it. Let's
do this. What is it?

40:00.632 --> 40:02.999
Uh, you know
just, I don't know.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.901
I'm going through this thing.

40:04.903 --> 40:06.769
Tony he's putting
you through the ringer.

40:06.771 --> 40:08.304
I'm telling you everybody
that's getting married,

40:08.306 --> 40:09.438
it's always crazy.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.440
Maybe not really Tony.

40:11.442 --> 40:13.876
I have a friend who um

40:13.878 --> 40:15.745
brought some things
to my attention,

40:15.747 --> 40:17.547
just reevaluating some stuff.

40:17.549 --> 40:19.415
A friend? The whole
time I've known you,

40:19.417 --> 40:21.184
you've never written
a song about a friend.

40:21.186 --> 40:24.687
Well, she's a really
special friend and-

40:24.689 --> 40:26.422
oh my god, it's that girl.

40:26.424 --> 40:27.690
What?

40:27.692 --> 40:30.393
That girl.

40:30.395 --> 40:31.561
She is just my friend.

40:31.563 --> 40:32.762
Frankie!

40:32.764 --> 40:33.963
She's just really great.

40:33.965 --> 40:35.965
- She...
- - Oh, yeah.

40:35.967 --> 40:39.735
- She's fun and.
- You like her.

40:39.737 --> 40:43.439
She's fun
and fiery and free and

40:43.441 --> 40:44.841
everything I'm not.

40:44.843 --> 40:49.445
I mean, she speaks Italian,
and she cooks Italian.

40:49.447 --> 40:50.746
Does Tony know?

40:50.748 --> 40:53.082
She might even be in the mafia.

40:54.519 --> 40:55.785
Are you kidding me?

40:55.787 --> 40:57.153
- I know.
- You can't even watch mob hits.

40:57.155 --> 40:59.355
Your girlfriend's
gonna be a mobster?

40:59.357 --> 41:00.623
I don't have a girlfriend.

41:00.625 --> 41:03.926
Oh my god. You're
crazy. I love you.

41:03.928 --> 41:05.394
- Kat.
- Frankie.

41:05.396 --> 41:08.130
Well, between Tony and
my family and his family,

41:08.132 --> 41:10.433
I mean, I cannot put
a girlfriend on my plate

41:10.435 --> 41:12.068
so you don't have anything
to worry about,

41:12.070 --> 41:13.469
- so can I just write a song?
- - Oh my god.

41:13.471 --> 41:14.837
Play the song,
play the song, come on.

41:14.839 --> 41:16.005
Start it over, from
the top, let's go.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.340
Oh yeah, it's gonna be called

41:17.342 --> 41:19.876
"you, Tony, and your
girlfriend the mobster."

41:19.878 --> 41:21.944
It's gonna be called "mob hit."

41:21.946 --> 41:24.080
You are off.

41:24.082 --> 41:25.748
- Can we just play the song?
- Let's call it mob hit.

41:25.750 --> 41:29.085
It's our newest
hit. Oh amazing.

41:42.032 --> 41:43.966
Not a word.

41:43.968 --> 41:45.501
<i>You gotta problem with it?</i>

41:47.771 --> 41:49.105
So?

41:49.840 --> 41:51.540
I'm intrigued.

41:51.542 --> 41:53.409
Okay. Intrigued is good.

41:54.511 --> 41:55.811
You hungry?

41:55.813 --> 41:57.213
After that, not really.

41:57.215 --> 42:01.550
Whatever. I fixed a meal
you could choke Caesar on.

42:01.552 --> 42:03.052
Come on.

42:10.427 --> 42:13.129
If I didn't do it, I'd
have to hire someone, and

42:13.131 --> 42:15.665
maybe I don't want
other guys in my yard.

42:18.535 --> 42:19.769
You got a birthday coming up.

42:19.771 --> 42:21.704
Are you ignorant?

42:21.706 --> 42:23.306
Why you gotta remind
me of a birthday

42:23.308 --> 42:24.974
when I'll I'm thinking is I'm
one step closer to the grave

42:24.976 --> 42:26.642
and I got nothing
to show for it.

42:26.644 --> 42:28.077
You know, you may think that
you've gone all Asian fusion,

42:28.079 --> 42:31.047
but your attitude
is pure sicily.

42:31.049 --> 42:32.214
Frankie is engaged.

42:32.216 --> 42:33.649
She's gonna be gone soon.

42:33.651 --> 42:35.084
Heather, well she may hang
on until I'm horizontal,

42:35.086 --> 42:36.886
but you don't gotta remind me

42:36.888 --> 42:38.654
of a day that I don't
wanna celebrate.

42:38.656 --> 42:40.489
You know, doing this made
me think of the old days

42:40.491 --> 42:43.159
when we'd make a big pile of
leaves, throw the girls in,

42:43.161 --> 42:44.327
roll around with them.

42:44.329 --> 42:45.995
Yeah, well, in
the words of Buddha,

42:45.997 --> 42:47.697
"be here now."

42:57.841 --> 42:59.475
These plates are amazing.

42:59.477 --> 43:01.010
Thanks.

43:01.878 --> 43:02.845
I have the whole collection.

43:02.847 --> 43:03.980
They belonged to my mother.

43:03.982 --> 43:05.348
Past tense, is she?

43:05.350 --> 43:07.316
No, she went back to
sicily when I was nine.

43:07.318 --> 43:09.051
But that's not why
I asked you here.

43:09.053 --> 43:12.088
I can't get you out
of my head, Frankie.

43:15.359 --> 43:17.727
You know, I've been
thinking about you too,

43:17.729 --> 43:19.095
but not in that way.

43:19.097 --> 43:22.365
You're stuffed shells
weren't that good.

43:22.367 --> 43:23.699
Weren't they?

43:30.407 --> 43:33.909
Um, I'm sorry. That
was so uncalled for.

43:33.911 --> 43:35.011
Smells go-

43:35.013 --> 43:39.515
dad, hi, you remember Frankie?

43:39.517 --> 43:43.152
Yeah, I met you at the
wake with my sister, Heather.

43:43.154 --> 43:44.954
I'm real sorry about pinky.

43:44.956 --> 43:46.789
- Your sister?
- Yeah, Heather.

43:46.791 --> 43:50.092
Yeah, you and she, you close?

43:50.094 --> 43:53.095
- I guess.
- You know Mr. Roma?

43:54.865 --> 43:56.565
- Son of a bitch.
- Huh?

43:56.567 --> 43:59.635
Don't play cute. Watch
yourself, sweetheart.

43:59.637 --> 44:00.936
Dad what the hell?

44:00.938 --> 44:03.739
I need to speak with you alone.

44:05.742 --> 44:07.009
I'm so sorry about that.

44:07.011 --> 44:09.245
- Nicolette.
- Okay, I'm coming.

44:10.881 --> 44:13.182
You don't have to be
rude to my friend.

44:28.598 --> 44:30.699
Tell you what,
something big is going down,

44:30.701 --> 44:32.568
and that girl knows something.

44:33.203 --> 44:34.603
What's she gonna know?

44:35.705 --> 44:37.106
Daughter could talk.

44:37.993 --> 44:38.442
What?

44:38.443 --> 44:41.644
It's not like the old days.
Women, they know shit now.

44:41.646 --> 44:43.546
Women always knew shit.

44:43.548 --> 44:44.980
Still no one's talking.

44:44.982 --> 44:47.149
Yeah, whatever. Fine.

44:47.984 --> 44:49.218
Know what?

44:49.220 --> 44:51.487
I got another idea entirely.

44:52.189 --> 44:55.524
No, you are not
gettin' this one.

44:55.526 --> 44:55.524
Really?

44:55.526 --> 44:58.894
Yep, big idea for
one, right here.

44:58.896 --> 44:59.862
Such a kiss ass.

45:02.133 --> 45:03.699
- Louie.
- Hey.

45:03.701 --> 45:05.534
Hey, keep going, keep going.

45:05.536 --> 45:05.534
You look great.

45:05.536 --> 45:09.438
My wife gave me this kind
of thing for our anniversary-

45:09.440 --> 45:11.841
yeah, but you ain't got a wife.

45:14.711 --> 45:16.345
It's gagoots.

45:16.347 --> 45:18.547
I wasn't sure before, but now,

45:18.549 --> 45:20.883
he sends a girl
over to spy on me.

45:20.885 --> 45:22.852
He's goin' through my daughter.

45:22.854 --> 45:25.020
His business has
sunk to a new low.

45:25.022 --> 45:26.722
No, look, it's not Sonny.

45:26.724 --> 45:29.892
I saw that girl getting
out of a federal car.

45:29.894 --> 45:31.260
I don't believe this.

45:31.262 --> 45:32.761
I can't even wax
my salami in peace.

45:32.763 --> 45:34.864
Whoa, you're doing this girl?

45:34.866 --> 45:37.500
Her sister, Christ.

45:38.301 --> 45:39.869
Even the females now.

45:39.871 --> 45:41.437
What's the world coming to?

45:41.439 --> 45:43.706
There's an old sanskrit saying,

45:43.708 --> 45:46.308
"you can't hook half a chicken,"

45:46.310 --> 45:48.777
"and expect the other
half to lay eggs."

45:48.779 --> 45:50.045
Shut the fuck up.

45:50.047 --> 45:52.715
Just sayin', it's all
down hill from here.

45:52.717 --> 45:54.083
You know who this girl is?

45:54.085 --> 45:55.317
Should I?

45:55.319 --> 45:56.785
Come on, we're done here.

45:56.787 --> 45:59.522
Come on get off this thing.

45:59.524 --> 46:01.056
- Alright, here we go.
- Come on.

46:05.296 --> 46:10.900
Something in the groinal
region just, you got me?

46:10.902 --> 46:12.501
I'm working out way too hard.

46:13.470 --> 46:15.871
Hold on, oh yeah, take it easy.

46:19.676 --> 46:21.243
I know, I know I'm late.

46:22.078 --> 46:25.848
I got caught up
watching mob hit.

46:25.850 --> 46:28.317
Yeah, yeah, I just, I gotta
grab a clean a work shirt,

46:28.319 --> 46:30.452
and then I'll be there.

46:31.254 --> 46:33.889
Alright.

46:39.696 --> 46:42.364
Tony. Hey!

46:42.366 --> 46:44.400
Hey.

46:45.168 --> 46:46.302
Ever hear of a broom?

46:46.304 --> 46:47.903
It's 10 times faster.

46:47.905 --> 46:49.271
Why is faster always better?

46:49.273 --> 46:51.073
I don't know what's
gotten into you lately.

46:51.075 --> 46:52.441
You wanna sweep, fine.

46:52.443 --> 46:54.276
Bet we could find
a broom inside.

46:55.045 --> 46:56.145
Didn't think so.

46:59.983 --> 47:01.150
Looks good, right?

47:01.152 --> 47:02.518
All I see is mob hit.

47:02.520 --> 47:04.019
The red sauce looks like blood.

47:04.021 --> 47:05.187
I can't believe you watched it.

47:05.189 --> 47:06.422
Where the hell were you?

47:06.424 --> 47:08.624
I had the most
amazing stuffed shells.

47:09.659 --> 47:10.859
Is that an answer?

47:16.267 --> 47:19.535
No but that is.

47:19.537 --> 47:22.438
I'm reconsidering the
audition, what do you think?

47:23.173 --> 47:25.908
Oh wow.

47:29.646 --> 47:31.080
Tastes like feet.

47:31.082 --> 47:32.214
It could be better.

47:32.216 --> 47:34.350
Yeah, could be
fresh, hot, steamy.

47:34.352 --> 47:35.651
It burnt my fingers?

47:35.653 --> 47:35.651
On the plate.

47:35.653 --> 47:38.687
Hmm, what happened to
fresh, hot, and steamy?

47:40.157 --> 47:42.891
- What?
- Speak to me in Italian.

47:42.893 --> 47:45.995
You're not serious, are you?

48:25.201 --> 48:27.303
Hey.

48:34.044 --> 48:35.544
Nicolette.

48:37.047 --> 48:39.348
Hello.

48:41.584 --> 48:43.552
Yes, I know, I know
what you had to do

48:43.554 --> 48:45.754
to keep her band in the
running for mob hit.

48:46.823 --> 48:49.525
I'll see what I can do
about getting my dad on set.

48:55.565 --> 48:57.366
Hey.

49:00.437 --> 49:05.074
Did you know that
your door is unlocked.

49:05.975 --> 49:07.843
Did you know that you're drunk?

49:09.512 --> 49:10.713
Clearly.

49:16.820 --> 49:18.454
What?

49:19.889 --> 49:21.023
Come on, Frankie.

49:21.991 --> 49:23.359
Did you mean it?

49:23.361 --> 49:26.095
The kiss? Is that
why you're here?

49:32.035 --> 49:33.635
What if I said maybe?

49:34.504 --> 49:39.675
I like maybe, but maybe is

49:39.677 --> 49:40.843
a lot of things.

49:40.845 --> 49:42.444
Maybe is...

49:43.513 --> 49:45.647
Full of possibility.

50:28.057 --> 50:29.458
Babe, you're drunk.

50:29.460 --> 50:31.360
Let me call you a car.

50:41.504 --> 50:43.338
You're wincing.

50:43.340 --> 50:44.673
I'm not wincing.

50:44.675 --> 50:47.242
Would you let me work
on your frets in peace?

50:47.244 --> 50:48.277
Go sing for my grandfather.

50:48.279 --> 50:49.778
You know he loves that shit.

50:51.147 --> 50:52.748
Please?

50:52.750 --> 50:55.617
Your frets'll be done
when you get back.

50:55.619 --> 50:57.352
Fine. Be good to her.
I'll be right back.

50:57.354 --> 51:00.823
Go on, go, go, go on, go.

51:05.462 --> 51:08.931
Put the a at everywhere and

51:08.933 --> 51:08.931
the d at-

51:08.933 --> 51:12.367
Bellafusco
thinks you called the hit.

51:12.369 --> 51:14.336
Now why the fuck
would he think that?

51:14.338 --> 51:15.471
You were supposed to divert-

51:15.473 --> 51:16.872
oh, oh, I understand.

51:16.874 --> 51:18.640
Gagoots, we
got move on this quick

51:18.642 --> 51:20.476
or you're a dead man.

51:20.478 --> 51:21.977
I'm a dead man?

51:21.979 --> 51:23.011
You brought me into this.

51:23.013 --> 51:24.746
No way I go down alone.

51:30.019 --> 51:35.123
There you are, Francesca,
you wanna sing for dad?

51:35.125 --> 51:36.358
What the fuck?

51:36.360 --> 51:39.561
Hey grandpa,
your nurse is here.

51:39.563 --> 51:41.730
He hates when they
send a male nurse.

51:41.732 --> 51:43.999
Not that I can blame him.

51:48.671 --> 51:50.973
I saw that girl right there
get out of a federal car.

51:50.975 --> 51:52.307
Ah, get the fuck out.

51:52.309 --> 51:54.109
Hey, Francesca.

51:54.111 --> 51:55.244
Hi, Mr. Roma.

51:55.246 --> 51:57.513
Good kid, she sings for my dad.

51:57.515 --> 51:58.714
Now look I'm just saying,

51:58.716 --> 52:01.083
I saw her get out
of a federal car.

52:01.085 --> 52:02.384
She's a girl, a nobody.

52:02.386 --> 52:03.585
My son fixes her guitar.

52:03.587 --> 52:04.853
Your bookie's kid?

52:04.855 --> 52:06.755
Nickel Mike?

52:06.757 --> 52:08.590
Plus she's been hanging
out with my goddaughter.

52:08.592 --> 52:10.526
Oh, from what
I've heard, she's a-

52:10.528 --> 52:12.561
look I'm just saying, gagoots.

52:12.563 --> 52:14.663
You keep an eye on her

52:15.331 --> 52:16.732
cause she ain't right.

52:27.143 --> 52:28.844
I hope my
guitar is safe in your car.

52:28.846 --> 52:31.613
Trust me, it's fine here.

52:34.284 --> 52:35.517
Hey Mike.

52:35.519 --> 52:36.852
How you doin'?

52:40.156 --> 52:41.757
Isn't that your dad and-

52:41.759 --> 52:43.358
ah, my uncle Louie, yeah.

52:43.360 --> 52:45.761
They don't like me
hanging around here.

52:46.462 --> 52:47.763
He's your uncle?

52:47.765 --> 52:49.898
Well, my second
cousin actually,

52:49.900 --> 52:52.034
but he's my godfather
and old, so.

52:52.036 --> 52:52.034
He's your godfather?

52:52.036 --> 52:54.703
Oh, of course he's
your godfather.

52:54.705 --> 52:56.738
Come on, come on, please.

52:56.740 --> 52:59.074
I'm from the neighborhood.

52:59.076 --> 53:03.912
My mother, she's, makes
a very inadequate ziti.

53:05.381 --> 53:06.548
This is insane.

53:06.550 --> 53:08.350
Why did you bring me here?

53:08.352 --> 53:10.352
I know all these guys.

53:10.354 --> 53:12.621
Thought you might want to
play to an appreciative crowd.

53:12.623 --> 53:14.189
You know, test some folk songs

53:14.191 --> 53:16.325
so you don't shoot yourself
in the foot at a real gig.

53:16.327 --> 53:17.559
Shoot myself in the foot?

53:17.561 --> 53:19.027
Why not just right
between the eyes?

53:19.029 --> 53:20.429
Thanks to you, I'm not
even sure if I have a band.

53:20.431 --> 53:22.230
- Nice going.
- Fuck you.

53:22.232 --> 53:24.933
How about fuck you mafia-Donna.

53:24.935 --> 53:27.169
Be my guest.

53:27.171 --> 53:29.204
What is that supposed to mean?

53:29.206 --> 53:31.340
Uh!

53:39.716 --> 53:42.050
So this is like
my seventh message.

53:42.052 --> 53:43.885
I can't believe you
just left me there.

53:43.887 --> 53:45.120
Seriously?

53:45.122 --> 53:47.155
You took my guitar.

53:48.524 --> 53:49.958
So Tony dropped by and
left something for you.

53:49.960 --> 53:52.861
Oh my god, what is it
with this guy and lasagna?

53:52.863 --> 53:55.697
I say one time, one freakin'
time that I miss mom's lasagna,

53:55.699 --> 53:58.000
and now I'm up to my ass in it.

53:58.668 --> 54:00.969
I think it's sweet. I love Tony.

54:02.505 --> 54:03.772
This is gonna be me.

54:03.774 --> 54:05.207
A gangster's goomah.

54:05.209 --> 54:07.009
I know it doesn't take
a lot of genetic material

54:07.011 --> 54:09.378
to make an entirely
different human being,

54:09.380 --> 54:11.713
but really Heather, really?

54:13.616 --> 54:15.183
You know I slept
with him, right?

54:15.185 --> 54:16.618
Who?

54:16.620 --> 54:18.286
Caesar. Who?

54:18.288 --> 54:19.521
What?

54:19.523 --> 54:21.056
Well no wonder he
looked at me weird.

54:21.058 --> 54:23.325
He was probably like, "oh,
your sister's got nice tits."

54:23.327 --> 54:24.526
Hey.

54:24.528 --> 54:27.229
But he said that?

54:27.231 --> 54:29.231
Did he?

54:31.668 --> 54:33.235
It's all fun and games now,

54:33.237 --> 54:35.871
but wait until you
get older, you'll see.

54:37.940 --> 54:39.307
I miss dad.

54:39.309 --> 54:41.810
Me too.

54:41.812 --> 54:42.878
You're gonna be married soon.

54:42.880 --> 54:45.213
You know what, we're going out.

54:45.581 --> 54:46.982
Really?

54:46.984 --> 54:48.617
Yeah. You have to change
this whole entire outfit.

54:48.619 --> 54:49.751
It's horrific.

54:49.753 --> 54:51.586
What is this cowboy vest?

54:51.588 --> 54:53.355
Got it at goodwill.

54:53.357 --> 54:54.456
Exactly.

55:03.633 --> 55:06.134
Oh come on, Heather,
you're not parking a semi.

55:06.136 --> 55:08.403
I can't believe I'm
trying to one-up laughlin.

55:08.405 --> 55:09.771
I'm the superior here.

55:09.773 --> 55:14.676
Oh my god, and I'm
totally talking to myself.

55:14.678 --> 55:17.412
Ugh, I must be tired.
God it's hot in here.

55:18.314 --> 55:19.981
I hate menopause.

55:25.421 --> 55:26.988
Son of a bitch.

55:26.990 --> 55:30.659
Holy shit, it's that kid again.

55:30.661 --> 55:33.195
Oh, these two girls
are up to something.

55:33.197 --> 55:37.899
No shit, laughlin, and
I'm gonna find out what.

55:38.468 --> 55:39.868
Hey, it's-

55:39.870 --> 55:43.105
here we go. Showtime.

55:43.107 --> 55:44.673
A hit? On who?

55:44.675 --> 55:45.540
I can't say.

55:45.542 --> 55:45.540
Why not?

55:45.542 --> 55:48.076
Life is dangerous
enough for you

55:48.078 --> 55:50.746
without actually knowing
what the hell is going on.

55:50.748 --> 55:52.013
Is that sarcasm?

55:52.015 --> 55:55.250
Cause that was
pretty good, for you.

55:55.252 --> 55:56.585
Heather, Francesca.

55:56.587 --> 55:57.953
Do I know you? Get
your hands off of me.

55:57.955 --> 55:59.688
I know you have evidence.

55:59.690 --> 56:01.256
You have a recording we need.

56:01.258 --> 56:02.457
Leave us alone.

56:02.459 --> 56:03.792
You guys think you
know everything.

56:03.794 --> 56:05.227
It's creepy, and I'm
getting no credit here

56:05.229 --> 56:06.962
for not blowing your
pervert friends' cover,

56:06.964 --> 56:08.630
so before you go
asking me what I know,

56:08.632 --> 56:11.266
here's a news flash, nothing.

56:11.268 --> 56:13.835
Who are you right now?

56:13.837 --> 56:16.638
May I remind you girls, this
is a federal investigation.

56:16.640 --> 56:20.175
You don't bring it to
us, we come to you.

56:21.210 --> 56:22.911
That was amazing.

56:24.781 --> 56:25.914
You know, if she
won't talk to the feds,

56:25.916 --> 56:27.783
maybe Sonny is playing me.

56:27.785 --> 56:29.384
Did he set me up?

56:32.021 --> 56:36.258
If he talks to Caesar, oh geez.

56:36.260 --> 56:37.793
My shitty luck always.

56:37.795 --> 56:39.895
Oh!

56:46.536 --> 56:48.236
Honey, bring me ice.

56:51.073 --> 56:52.874
Your sister sounded
pretty shaken up, or

56:52.876 --> 56:55.510
excited, with her
it's hard to tell.

56:55.512 --> 56:57.312
What's going on?

56:57.314 --> 56:58.346
I need my guitar.

56:58.348 --> 56:59.514
Right now?

56:59.516 --> 57:00.549
Tomorrow might be too late.

57:00.551 --> 57:02.450
What is that supposed to mean?

57:02.452 --> 57:04.853
I just need my guitar.

57:04.855 --> 57:06.688
- Forget about it.
- Forget about it?

57:06.690 --> 57:07.956
You don't say forget about it,

57:07.958 --> 57:10.759
- Frankie-
- I said forget it, okay?

57:10.761 --> 57:12.894
Your sister said
something about the feds.

57:14.397 --> 57:16.765
If the feds show up
and something goes down,

57:16.767 --> 57:18.466
I'll never get it back.

57:18.468 --> 57:20.669
This is associated
with that? No.

57:20.671 --> 57:21.937
Dad it's my les Paul.

57:21.939 --> 57:23.338
Don't be ridiculous.

57:23.340 --> 57:24.172
She just had a fret job.

57:24.174 --> 57:26.007
Excuse me?

57:26.009 --> 57:28.910
I just need my guitar.

57:30.313 --> 57:33.014
I'll take you.

57:33.016 --> 57:36.885
Fine. You know I'm not
seven anymore, right?

57:36.887 --> 57:39.020
Stop acting like it.

57:41.859 --> 57:43.358
We're not here. Live large.

57:43.360 --> 57:44.359
Leave a message.

57:46.363 --> 57:49.231
<i>Look, I think</i>
<i>your lovebird's gonna chirp.</i>

57:50.933 --> 57:52.767
What the fuck are
you talking about?

57:52.769 --> 57:54.803
Your breakheart
manicurist and her sister,

57:54.805 --> 57:55.804
they're dirty.

57:55.806 --> 57:57.239
I got proof.

57:57.241 --> 57:58.607
All right, thanks.

58:00.209 --> 58:01.543
Hey, Nikki.

58:01.545 --> 58:02.711
About your friend.

58:02.713 --> 58:04.646
What now, dad?

58:14.991 --> 58:16.725
Who else is here?

58:16.727 --> 58:18.159
Mr. bell-

58:18.161 --> 58:20.629
what is this supposed to
be some kind of distraction?

58:21.899 --> 58:23.665
Oh my god, where's your?

58:23.667 --> 58:25.233
It's around the corner.

58:29.472 --> 58:31.139
Hey, do I look finished?

58:31.141 --> 58:32.641
You ever heard dry cleaning?

58:32.643 --> 58:33.708
It relaxes me.

58:33.710 --> 58:35.911
Oh yeah, you look real relaxed.

58:42.218 --> 58:43.685
Frozen lasagna.

58:43.687 --> 58:45.420
I'll get you a washcloth.

58:47.924 --> 58:50.458
What do you know?

58:50.460 --> 58:52.827
Okay, you know that saying,
keep your friends close

58:52.829 --> 58:54.629
and your enemies closer?

58:54.631 --> 58:55.997
Ow, ow, ow.

58:55.999 --> 58:58.533
Yours is up your ass.

58:59.769 --> 59:01.269
What is?

59:01.271 --> 59:05.006
Ow, god. It's Nicolette's
uncle,.

59:05.008 --> 59:06.007
I know the pudgy guy.

59:06.009 --> 59:07.609
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

59:07.611 --> 59:11.980
Frankie. Ow, fuck! Shit.

59:13.416 --> 59:15.016
Where's my daughter?

59:16.319 --> 59:17.719
Hey, stop it.

59:17.721 --> 59:19.020
We're leaving.

59:19.022 --> 59:20.155
You know she just
wants her guitar, right?

59:20.157 --> 59:21.723
Is that why you're here?

59:23.392 --> 59:25.560
Ridiculous, all of you.

59:27.263 --> 59:29.130
Come on.

59:29.132 --> 59:31.700
You sure about what
you said in there?

59:35.705 --> 59:37.372
Take a listen.

59:40.309 --> 59:42.110
Here.

59:43.879 --> 59:45.180
Where'd you park?

59:45.182 --> 59:47.349
You gotta get that horn changed.

59:58.861 --> 01:00:00.595
What did you give him?

01:00:02.098 --> 01:00:03.465
Dad, I'm just
trying to protect you.

01:00:03.467 --> 01:00:05.300
Hey, I'm gonna ask
this one more time,

01:00:05.302 --> 01:00:07.736
and out of respect for
me, I need you to answer.

01:00:07.738 --> 01:00:09.170
What did you give him?

01:00:10.006 --> 01:00:12.207
- Answer me!
- All right.

01:00:12.908 --> 01:00:14.509
My mp3 player.

01:00:14.511 --> 01:00:16.344
Recorder thing, you know.

01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:20.148
Do you know this guy?

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:22.550
I'm trying to figure
something out here.

01:00:25.287 --> 01:00:27.222
Alright, I need to
tell you something,

01:00:27.224 --> 01:00:30.959
and I don't want you
to get all nutty on me.

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:32.494
Can you handle this?

01:00:33.929 --> 01:00:35.096
I don't think I can handle any

01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:37.065
of the things I've
been handling.

01:00:37.878 --> 01:00:38.367
Alright.

01:00:38.368 --> 01:00:41.770
I don't really work
at the daycare center,

01:00:41.772 --> 01:00:47.142
I just, I make
book out of there.

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:51.746
I take bets

01:00:51.748 --> 01:00:53.548
through basically that guy.

01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:55.316
I work for gagoots.

01:00:57.219 --> 01:00:58.987
I tried to shield
you girls from it.

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:00.522
I'm sorry.

01:01:00.524 --> 01:01:03.391
I just didn't need you to
know that I was in the life.

01:01:07.329 --> 01:01:09.164
Wow.

01:01:09.665 --> 01:01:12.133
Come on, Frankie.

01:01:12.135 --> 01:01:13.701
Let me drive you home, come on.

01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:17.038
If anything happens, your
mother'd choke me with wasabi.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.140
Does she know?

01:01:21.977 --> 01:01:23.545
Of course she does.

01:01:26.215 --> 01:01:27.482
Come on, you're not safe now.

01:01:27.484 --> 01:01:31.553
Actually, it looks
like I never was.

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:07.422
Couldn't you just
leave me alone, dad?

01:02:12.261 --> 01:02:13.962
I saw you
with your dad, Frankie.

01:02:13.964 --> 01:02:15.530
You okay?

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:22.670
You wanna talk about something?

01:02:28.677 --> 01:02:31.913
Um, right. Maybe I
shouldn't have come here.

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:33.815
Wait.

01:03:01.243 --> 01:03:03.311
What? What is this?

01:03:03.313 --> 01:03:05.246
Do we really have to know?

01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:10.451
I think I need to know.

01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:13.588
I don't know.

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:20.061
I can go if you want me to go.

01:03:20.063 --> 01:03:21.796
No.

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:23.598
I'm not sure.

01:03:49.226 --> 01:03:51.693
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:03:51.695 --> 01:03:53.294
Okay.

01:03:55.264 --> 01:03:57.198
Hey, babe, where are you?

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.967
I've been trying you all day.

01:03:58.969 --> 01:04:00.301
Alright, I'm gonna use a key.

01:04:00.303 --> 01:04:02.503
Talk to you later.
I'll be inside.

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:06.474
Frankie.

01:04:06.476 --> 01:04:07.742
Oh, hey.

01:04:08.711 --> 01:04:09.811
What are we doing?

01:04:09.813 --> 01:04:10.845
What?

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.313
We can't do this.

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:15.216
My god, I had cake with a
priest and a Jesus statue.

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:16.217
What are you talking about?

01:04:16.219 --> 01:04:17.585
I, I'm not, I'm not gay.

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:19.153
This is not how my
life is supposed to be.

01:04:19.155 --> 01:04:20.655
This is not me.

01:04:20.657 --> 01:04:24.058
I can't be who everyone who
you and my dad and your dad

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.693
and oh my god, and Tony.

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:27.262
I can't be who you
all want me to be.

01:04:27.264 --> 01:04:28.763
I'm sorry.

01:04:34.703 --> 01:04:37.171
Notice anything
strange about Frankie?

01:04:37.173 --> 01:04:38.673
Yeah, everything.

01:04:38.675 --> 01:04:41.743
Like the fact that she's
obsessed with Italian culture

01:04:41.745 --> 01:04:44.512
or she has uneven nails
or that she prefers gelato

01:04:44.514 --> 01:04:46.447
over Ben and Jerry's. What?

01:04:46.449 --> 01:04:48.883
No I mean anything that
I would consider strange.

01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:50.618
That's not strange?

01:04:54.023 --> 01:04:55.890
I'm not letting you go.

01:05:04.867 --> 01:05:06.467
Have to.

01:05:07.236 --> 01:05:08.269
Hey, there you are.

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:09.671
I've been trying you all day.

01:05:09.673 --> 01:05:10.772
Where you been?

01:05:10.774 --> 01:05:10.772
Uh, the studio.

01:05:10.774 --> 01:05:13.374
You could at least
answer your phone.

01:05:13.376 --> 01:05:15.243
Uh, you know, I really
can't do this right now.

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:16.477
Do what?

01:05:16.479 --> 01:05:18.012
I have to get to nonna's.

01:05:18.014 --> 01:05:19.447
I promised her I'd pick up
the pizzelles for the feast.

01:05:19.449 --> 01:05:20.948
Wait, I thought we
were going together.

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:22.583
Can I just meet you there?

01:05:23.185 --> 01:05:24.886
Yeah, yeah, sure.

01:05:24.888 --> 01:05:26.187
Okay.

01:05:26.189 --> 01:05:27.355
Wait, are you sure
everything's okay?

01:05:27.357 --> 01:05:28.923
Tony, I said I'm fine.

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:31.993
Jesus.

01:05:33.195 --> 01:05:35.663
I'm sorry.

01:05:35.665 --> 01:05:38.099
I just have a lot
going on, okay?

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:40.668
Engagement?

01:05:41.804 --> 01:05:44.706
I really don't wanna
get into it, okay?

01:05:44.708 --> 01:05:47.208
Okay, yeah, sure.

01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:49.410
I'll see you at the
feast, all right?

01:05:50.446 --> 01:05:53.314
Don't take too long.

01:05:53.316 --> 01:05:55.384
And next year, my lasagna
gonna be at the feast.

01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:56.017
- Lasagna.

01:05:56.019 --> 01:05:58.519
- Yes, lasagna, lots of freakin' lasagna.
- - That's what we're

01:05:58.521 --> 01:06:00.021
gonna feast on.

01:06:03.425 --> 01:06:05.526
Ma, your cantine is a mess.

01:06:05.528 --> 01:06:07.061
How old is this can of tomatoes?

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:09.564
Hey, that's my gravy.

01:06:09.566 --> 01:06:11.466
Hi, aunt cheech,
your mother's here.

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:13.568
- I know.
- You know why.

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:13.568
Shhh.

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:16.003
What? We're not
talking about it?

01:06:16.005 --> 01:06:17.438
She's getting married.
Let's talk about that.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.506
It's alright Zia.

01:06:18.508 --> 01:06:19.607
Stop with the sugar.

01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:21.275
Your gravy's always sour.

01:06:21.277 --> 01:06:22.844
Santa Maria.

01:06:23.379 --> 01:06:25.346
Francesca go taste it.

01:06:25.348 --> 01:06:27.315
See what it needs.

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:28.950
I should really
get to the feast.

01:06:28.952 --> 01:06:31.519
Besides, my stomach's not right.

01:06:32.354 --> 01:06:36.424
Oh, Frankie, your father,

01:06:36.426 --> 01:06:39.360
he never wanted to hurt you.

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:40.695
I don't get it.

01:06:40.697 --> 01:06:41.963
When I was little, he
took me to belmont park

01:06:41.965 --> 01:06:43.297
and had me place a bet.

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:45.032
There were all these
long lines and-

01:06:45.034 --> 01:06:46.300
I know where this is going.

01:06:46.302 --> 01:06:47.635
- Windows and.
- Let her tell her story.

01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:49.303
Then he took me
around the corner,

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:50.805
and there were these
three small windows

01:06:50.807 --> 01:06:52.540
and no line.

01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:56.077
He says, "this is where
you collect your winnings."

01:06:56.079 --> 01:06:57.278
"Think about it."

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.579
His father

01:06:58.581 --> 01:07:01.149
took him to the
track in Saratoga.

01:07:01.151 --> 01:07:04.519
What he was a said there.

01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:07.889
You didn't miss
anything, cheech.

01:07:07.891 --> 01:07:09.457
Your father missed it.

01:07:09.459 --> 01:07:10.658
It's a good story.

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.261
It could end better
like your gravy.

01:07:16.331 --> 01:07:17.765
I'll be right out Sofia.

01:07:17.767 --> 01:07:19.834
I just gotta put a couple
things together here.

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:29.043
Thought you might be hungry.

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:30.912
Looks nice. Thank you.

01:07:30.914 --> 01:07:32.046
Espresso?

01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:33.915
No, I don't drink it any more.

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:35.983
What do you drink?

01:07:35.985 --> 01:07:37.518
Green tea?

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:40.455
No, but hey, I can
run down the block.

01:07:40.457 --> 01:07:42.490
Hey look, I'm not sure
that they have it.

01:07:42.492 --> 01:07:45.359
You did it with the
lemon rind in the sugar.

01:07:45.361 --> 01:07:46.861
Yeah.

01:07:54.937 --> 01:07:56.537
So what's so important?

01:07:59.608 --> 01:08:03.211
Frankie got herself in a little
bit of a jam.

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:06.881
I had to fess up to our girl.

01:08:08.383 --> 01:08:09.917
Frankie was in a spot.

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:12.086
She was at the don's house, and
I had to tell her what I do.

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:13.788
Hey, hey, hey. Hey no.

01:08:15.491 --> 01:08:16.924
Yeah, step on up wildcat.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:16.924
No way.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:20.694
A Vincent d'amico bobblehead.

01:08:22.363 --> 01:08:24.064
Cut ya deal.

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:26.667
Hey.

01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:28.069
Come on you got this.

01:08:28.071 --> 01:08:30.705
Oh, getting close.

01:08:30.707 --> 01:08:32.974
Watch how you flip your wrist.

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:34.242
That was way-

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:36.243
win the prize pretty girl.

01:08:36.246 --> 01:08:37.712
Move it.

01:08:40.215 --> 01:08:41.182
We got a winner.

01:08:41.184 --> 01:08:43.149
I'll take the bobblehead.

01:08:45.988 --> 01:08:48.154
Yes. It's precious.

01:08:55.796 --> 01:08:59.200
Pizza here, fresh hot pizza.

01:08:59.202 --> 01:09:01.536
Slice of pepperoni
coming up hot.

01:09:04.706 --> 01:09:06.807
I don't suppose you
want to share something?

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:08.075
Shut it.

01:09:08.077 --> 01:09:09.377
Right, shutting.

01:09:09.379 --> 01:09:10.611
You know this is all
just a big mistake.

01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:12.212
Hating the mafia is
so like last week.

01:09:12.215 --> 01:09:13.548
Oh, hey sweetheart,
why don't you

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:15.116
help me find Nicolette?

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:19.554
I got this.

01:09:37.305 --> 01:09:39.006
What are you doing here?

01:09:40.008 --> 01:09:41.274
What am I doing?

01:09:42.944 --> 01:09:45.546
Jesus, Frankie, are
you really that blind?

01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:46.581
I'm in love with you.

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:48.515
- What?
- You're gay?

01:09:58.226 --> 01:10:00.895
Hey Caesar Bellafusco, sick.

01:10:00.897 --> 01:10:01.929
Holy shit.

01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:03.731
You really are.

01:10:03.733 --> 01:10:05.700
I ought to ask you
for your autograph.

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:06.968
Then I'd have to kill you.

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:09.704
You're better looking on TV.

01:10:10.739 --> 01:10:12.239
Got a problem with it?

01:10:12.241 --> 01:10:15.042
Dad, the answer is yes.

01:10:17.479 --> 01:10:19.880
Come on, Frankie, let's go.

01:10:35.864 --> 01:10:37.965
Used to be so simple, you know?

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:41.636
It was loyalty, regard
for certain ways.

01:10:41.638 --> 01:10:43.337
Frankie won this for me.

01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:45.606
What?

01:10:45.608 --> 01:10:47.208
My daughter, Heather,
absolutely no manners,

01:10:47.210 --> 01:10:50.411
but we raised her, so,
who you gonna blame?

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:53.114
Yeah. Hi Caesar.

01:10:53.116 --> 01:10:54.715
Charmed.

01:10:54.717 --> 01:10:58.653
I always thought I'd give
her a huge wedding, you know?

01:10:58.655 --> 01:11:00.354
- What's he talking about?
- I have no idea.

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:01.822
My daughter.

01:11:01.824 --> 01:11:06.794
She's got a problem with
my lifestyle, my lifestyle.

01:11:06.796 --> 01:11:09.397
Now I find out she's
got a lifestyle too.

01:11:09.399 --> 01:11:12.033
Lifestyle?

01:11:13.869 --> 01:11:16.937
Oh my god, she's, she's

01:11:17.673 --> 01:11:19.206
a vagitarian?

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:20.908
Your daughter's a lesbian?

01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:22.543
What's that say about Frankie?

01:11:22.545 --> 01:11:23.711
Our Frankie? She's engaged.

01:11:23.713 --> 01:11:25.713
- To a man?
- Yeah, to a man.

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:29.583
He's a fricking frozen
food entrepreneur, why?

01:11:29.585 --> 01:11:31.552
This calls for
a family meeting.

01:11:31.554 --> 01:11:32.820
Your mother and I are divorced.

01:11:32.822 --> 01:11:34.288
We don't do family meetings.

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:35.890
But you still love her, right?

01:11:36.758 --> 01:11:38.759
Yeah, he still loves her.

01:11:40.395 --> 01:11:42.063
You're not gonna call me again?

01:11:43.965 --> 01:11:46.834
No.

01:11:47.235 --> 01:11:49.437
Did you?

01:11:49.439 --> 01:11:50.371
My god, he's-

01:11:50.373 --> 01:11:51.672
yeah, I know.

01:11:51.674 --> 01:11:53.007
And not to mention that
he's old enough to be-

01:11:53.009 --> 01:11:53.941
he's my age.

01:11:53.943 --> 01:11:54.975
And the woman you were seeing

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:56.444
when you left mom was how old?

01:11:57.245 --> 01:11:59.313
Come on, intervention time.

01:12:03.919 --> 01:12:05.553
I wonder
who signed up this year.

01:12:05.555 --> 01:12:07.354
Maybe nonna is making
another appearance.

01:12:07.356 --> 01:12:08.889
That's it. Not another word

01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:11.425
until you tell me what's
going on between you and her.

01:12:12.327 --> 01:12:13.461
There's nothing to say.

01:12:13.463 --> 01:12:14.795
A girl just told
you she loved you.

01:12:14.797 --> 01:12:16.731
What's wrong with her?

01:12:16.733 --> 01:12:18.466
Nothing is wrong with her.

01:12:18.468 --> 01:12:19.533
Will you just stop it?

01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:20.601
Stop what?

01:12:20.603 --> 01:12:21.469
I gotta go to the dance.

01:12:21.471 --> 01:12:23.771
You coming or not?

01:12:23.773 --> 01:12:25.473
What is going on with you two?

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:29.543
I don't know.

01:12:29.545 --> 01:12:32.413
She's my friend.

01:12:32.415 --> 01:12:33.914
I don't know.

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:37.151
Well, you better figure it out.

01:12:47.929 --> 01:12:50.698
<i>Paison, make</i>
<i>your way to the staging area.</i>

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:53.000
<i>It's time to pizzica.</i>

01:12:57.839 --> 01:13:01.208
Sing the unsung,
heroes Italiane.

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:19.660
Nicolette.

01:15:02.297 --> 01:15:05.499
Pizzica.

01:15:25.772 --> 01:15:26.221
Ma!

01:15:26.222 --> 01:15:28.656
This is what I get
for getting pregnant

01:15:28.658 --> 01:15:30.691
before I was married.

01:15:30.693 --> 01:15:32.426
What?

01:15:32.428 --> 01:15:34.295
I mean what did I
do to deserve this?

01:15:34.297 --> 01:15:36.530
A cheating husband, a gay
child, and this one, a-

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:37.698
kid who slept with a mobster.

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:38.999
What?

01:15:39.001 --> 01:15:40.668
Give it a rest, ma.
We all got problems.

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:43.404
Ma.

01:15:45.006 --> 01:15:47.841
This is your fault.

01:15:47.843 --> 01:15:50.044
I mean are you really gay?

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:52.246
It's cool because now I can
screw up as much as I want.

01:15:54.482 --> 01:15:55.849
Nope.

01:15:55.851 --> 01:15:57.751
Take some lessons mommy-to-be.

01:15:57.753 --> 01:15:59.186
What? Don't come out to your

01:15:59.188 --> 01:16:00.554
Italian family during the feast.

01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:02.690
Not for nothing,

01:16:02.692 --> 01:16:05.025
but the girlfriend's hot!

01:16:08.496 --> 01:16:10.030
I'm really-

01:16:13.401 --> 01:16:15.202
sorry, Jesus.

01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:25.746
You let her go.

01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:27.147
She's trouble.

01:16:27.149 --> 01:16:28.949
What about gagoots?

01:16:28.951 --> 01:16:31.051
You're more worried about
a couple of females.

01:16:31.053 --> 01:16:32.920
Oh, you wanna go after Sonny,

01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:35.923
we need proof, and
I'm just saying,

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:38.158
those girls have it.

01:16:47.902 --> 01:16:49.737
Yeah that thing
with the general,

01:16:50.839 --> 01:16:52.339
I'm on it.

01:17:04.185 --> 01:17:06.553
Come in.

01:17:15.263 --> 01:17:16.764
I'm here to see Nicolette.

01:17:16.766 --> 01:17:18.298
Come here.

01:17:22.804 --> 01:17:24.705
How'd you get this?

01:17:24.707 --> 01:17:27.441
Little gino works on my guitar.

01:17:27.443 --> 01:17:28.609
You know he gives a
really great fret job

01:17:28.611 --> 01:17:29.710
if you ever need one.

01:17:29.712 --> 01:17:31.111
What?

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:33.380
I don't wanna know.

01:17:33.382 --> 01:17:34.948
So I was there,
you know, getting

01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:36.083
- a fret job.
- - Yeah, whatever

01:17:36.085 --> 01:17:37.484
the fuck fret job thing.

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:40.754
Yeah, and he told me to
go sing for his grandfather.

01:17:40.756 --> 01:17:41.922
He likes to hear old stuff.

01:17:41.924 --> 01:17:43.090
So you know Roma?

01:17:43.092 --> 01:17:45.259
You sing in Italian?

01:17:45.261 --> 01:17:45.259
Yeah.

01:17:45.261 --> 01:17:48.729
Uh, my ex-wife used
to sing in Italian.

01:17:48.731 --> 01:17:51.331
Okay.

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:53.667
And I went to the courtyard and

01:17:54.702 --> 01:17:56.437
that's when I heard it.

01:17:58.073 --> 01:18:00.040
Oh, maybe they set Louie up.

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:01.375
Maybe you work for gagoots.

01:18:01.377 --> 01:18:03.677
You know gagoots is a
really stupid nickname.

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:04.945
I'm not debating that.

01:18:04.947 --> 01:18:06.246
I don't work for him.

01:18:06.248 --> 01:18:07.414
I'm a musician. I play guitar.

01:18:07.416 --> 01:18:09.416
You make money
off the old stuff.

01:18:09.418 --> 01:18:10.517
Not exactly.

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:12.619
You should get a
band, play weddings.

01:18:12.621 --> 01:18:13.854
I had a band.

01:18:13.856 --> 01:18:15.055
A lot of money in weddings.

01:18:15.057 --> 01:18:16.490
We were rock and roll.

01:18:16.492 --> 01:18:18.959
Uh, so you uh, looking
more wedding band,

01:18:18.961 --> 01:18:20.694
you don't mind my saying.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:22.196
Actually I do.

01:18:23.264 --> 01:18:25.499
Now can I go see your daughter?

01:18:25.501 --> 01:18:27.334
She went up to bed.

01:18:27.336 --> 01:18:28.635
Good.

01:18:40.415 --> 01:18:42.349
I'm sorry about that comment.

01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:45.285
The mafia Donna thing.

01:18:46.988 --> 01:18:48.388
It was wrong.

01:18:49.457 --> 01:18:52.159
Really Frankie, that's
what you're sorry about?

01:20:15.543 --> 01:20:16.810
We should talk.

01:20:17.745 --> 01:20:18.879
What the fuck is that?

01:20:18.881 --> 01:20:19.947
Modern technology.

01:20:19.949 --> 01:20:21.615
You're gonna wanna hear this.

01:20:22.951 --> 01:20:24.284
You carrying?

01:20:24.286 --> 01:20:26.253
Come on, give me
more credit than that.

01:20:26.888 --> 01:20:28.388
Hello.

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:29.356
Hi.

01:20:29.358 --> 01:20:30.991
Is your father inside?

01:20:30.993 --> 01:20:32.960
Jesus you skeeve me out.

01:20:32.962 --> 01:20:34.261
A male nurse is a-

01:20:34.263 --> 01:20:36.230
no, I just, I care
about your father.

01:20:36.232 --> 01:20:38.565
See, right there, that's
what I'm talking about.

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:39.800
You're fired.

01:20:39.802 --> 01:20:41.268
What?

01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:43.070
Yeah, fuck it. He's my father.

01:20:43.072 --> 01:20:44.271
I can care about him.

01:20:44.273 --> 01:20:45.906
Now get the fuck out of here.

01:20:45.908 --> 01:20:47.241
- Sir.
- - Go!

01:20:51.946 --> 01:20:53.947
What?

01:20:53.949 --> 01:20:55.415
It's your father.

01:20:56.884 --> 01:20:58.652
Eh, come on.

01:21:22.477 --> 01:21:24.311
Scoot over. You're
hogging the whole sink.

01:21:24.313 --> 01:21:26.880
You have the tiniest bathroom.

01:21:28.616 --> 01:21:30.817
Oh my god, what'd I get on me.

01:21:31.953 --> 01:21:33.053
Just a little something.

01:21:33.855 --> 01:21:35.355
Wanna borrow some clothes?

01:21:35.357 --> 01:21:38.492
Yeah, like I will
fit into your clothes.

01:21:38.494 --> 01:21:40.827
Uh, what am I gonna do?

01:21:42.797 --> 01:21:44.631
You're so beautiful.

01:21:47.302 --> 01:21:48.969
Well right back at ya.

01:21:56.978 --> 01:21:58.779
Don't forget to starch.

01:22:01.182 --> 01:22:02.182
I didn't wanna believe it.

01:22:02.184 --> 01:22:04.951
Why? Because we're family?

01:22:04.953 --> 01:22:06.820
Uncle Louie.

01:22:06.822 --> 01:22:08.455
What? You got someone here?

01:22:08.457 --> 01:22:10.590
Believe me. She ain't
got a guy in here.

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:12.392
I didn't s-what you know?

01:22:12.394 --> 01:22:15.796
Everybody knows.
Cat's outta the bag.

01:22:16.998 --> 01:22:19.232
Hey, you're engaged.

01:22:20.402 --> 01:22:21.568
- Dad!
- Jeez.

01:22:21.570 --> 01:22:23.070
- What the fuck?
- Whoa.

01:22:23.072 --> 01:22:24.237
Son of a-

01:22:24.239 --> 01:22:25.572
yeah because we're family.

01:22:25.574 --> 01:22:27.641
Alright, alright, take
it easy, take it easy.

01:22:28.643 --> 01:22:30.344
You FBI?

01:22:30.346 --> 01:22:32.145
Oh, me? No, Jesus.

01:22:32.147 --> 01:22:34.081
Don't take the
lord's name in vane.

01:22:34.083 --> 01:22:35.382
Bout time gagoots.

01:22:35.384 --> 01:22:37.951
Wait a second. What
are-the two of you?

01:22:37.953 --> 01:22:39.553
Let's go get some cannoli.

01:22:39.555 --> 01:22:40.987
Oh geez.

01:22:44.325 --> 01:22:46.426
And you wonder
why mom left you.

01:22:47.995 --> 01:22:50.297
I know why your mother left.

01:22:50.299 --> 01:22:52.232
You planning to follow?

01:22:52.234 --> 01:22:54.234
What? This is my alternative?

01:22:54.236 --> 01:22:55.836
What? You wanna
go to Italy? Do it.

01:22:55.838 --> 01:22:58.438
But you think she's gonna
want a fanook for a daughter?

01:23:05.546 --> 01:23:07.247
I don't care what he thinks.

01:23:07.249 --> 01:23:09.282
He's a fuckin' beast.

01:23:09.284 --> 01:23:10.250
Least I know how to love.

01:23:10.252 --> 01:23:11.852
He's just, he can't even.

01:23:19.694 --> 01:23:21.094
I'm sorry.

01:23:33.274 --> 01:23:35.075
You're coming
to the salon, right?

01:23:35.077 --> 01:23:36.843
Yes, alright already.

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:38.912
Your hair is gonna rock.

01:23:38.914 --> 01:23:40.614
Hey.

01:23:47.889 --> 01:23:50.056
It's hard not to feel
what you're feeling.

01:23:51.058 --> 01:23:52.893
What do you know about it?

01:23:54.896 --> 01:23:57.964
Not much.

01:23:57.966 --> 01:24:01.134
Enough to know that the more
you try and hide something,

01:24:01.136 --> 01:24:02.869
the worse it is
when it comes out.

01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:12.479
I am never going
to forgive you.

01:24:14.682 --> 01:24:17.517
Okay.

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:20.921
But I'm never gonna stop
loving you, no matter what.

Wow, that's intense.

01:25:15.244 --> 01:25:17.511
How are you so calm?

Frankie stop.

01:25:20.983 --> 01:25:22.549
I do not get you.

01:25:22.551 --> 01:25:25.318
I grew up with this, okay?

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:27.153
It's what I know.
Be glad that you don't.

01:25:27.155 --> 01:25:29.289
You had the best mob experience
that a kid could have.

01:25:29.291 --> 01:25:30.891
The oblivious kind.

01:25:30.893 --> 01:25:33.260
Your family wanted
to protect you.

01:25:33.262 --> 01:25:35.262
That's what a family's
supposed to do.

01:25:37.798 --> 01:25:40.267
How are things with your mom?

01:25:40.269 --> 01:25:43.537
Awful, but at least
I have the band.

01:25:43.539 --> 01:25:45.138
The atavistic altos are back.

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:46.806
That is such a stupid name.
You know that, right?

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:49.776
Atavistic? It doesn't even
feel right in my mouth.

01:25:50.545 --> 01:25:52.913
I like your mouth.

01:25:52.915 --> 01:25:55.115
Stop you don't know
yourself, Francesca.

01:25:55.117 --> 01:25:57.951
Maybe not, but I'm trying.

01:26:21.243 --> 01:26:22.976
Oh my god, stop it.

01:26:22.978 --> 01:26:22.976
Tony.

01:26:22.978 --> 01:26:25.579
How the
hell did you get in here?

01:26:25.581 --> 01:26:27.147
Your fuckin' doors unlocked.

01:26:28.649 --> 01:26:30.483
Stop it, Tony.

01:26:30.485 --> 01:26:31.885
I don't believe you're a gay.

01:26:31.887 --> 01:26:33.320
Well, I don't believe
you're a nutcase.

01:26:33.322 --> 01:26:35.055
What the fuck?

01:26:35.957 --> 01:26:37.958
What are you doing
with these two?

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:37.958
She's my daughter.

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:40.427
Right, right,
she's your daughter.

01:26:40.429 --> 01:26:41.861
And this is a
nightmare, not my dream.

01:26:41.863 --> 01:26:43.530
Dad, just go in,
the door's open.

01:26:43.532 --> 01:26:44.998
What did you do to her?

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.499
Sofia, take it easy.

01:26:46.501 --> 01:26:47.934
It's bullshit.

01:26:47.936 --> 01:26:49.436
Hey, you guys know your
front door's wide open?

01:26:49.438 --> 01:26:52.339
Don't you lesbians
ever wear bras?

01:26:52.341 --> 01:26:53.440
I'm sorry.

01:26:53.442 --> 01:26:54.574
Cut the dramatics.

01:26:54.576 --> 01:26:55.475
What are you cooking?

01:26:55.477 --> 01:26:56.476
Lasagna?

01:26:56.478 --> 01:26:58.612
Sit down everybody for lasagna.

01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:01.848
Uh, your door's open.

01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:04.517
Dad. What are you doing here?

01:27:04.519 --> 01:27:06.620
What are you doing here?

01:27:06.622 --> 01:27:08.188
'Sup Mike?

01:27:09.056 --> 01:27:11.157
Oh my god.

01:27:19.967 --> 01:27:22.102
So, you're sleeping
with my daughter?

01:27:24.305 --> 01:27:25.271
It's against the church.

01:27:25.273 --> 01:27:26.706
That's right.

01:27:26.708 --> 01:27:28.742
Last time I checked
the commandments,

01:27:28.744 --> 01:27:30.043
this wasn't even in the top 10,

01:27:30.045 --> 01:27:32.245
so if we wanna talk
about sinning, fine,

01:27:32.247 --> 01:27:34.180
let's all confess.

01:27:34.182 --> 01:27:35.382
You first.

01:27:35.384 --> 01:27:36.650
She's got a point.

01:27:36.652 --> 01:27:38.018
Hey, at least they're
both Italian, right?

01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:39.352
I'm Italian.

01:27:39.354 --> 01:27:41.821
And she's a good cook.

01:27:41.823 --> 01:27:45.458
Hey, listen kid, I know you
feel like shit, but trust me,

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:47.127
stick to business.

01:27:47.129 --> 01:27:50.664
Family meal is shot, all you
need is a convincing photo.

01:27:50.666 --> 01:27:52.399
Your own mama Celeste.

01:27:52.401 --> 01:27:53.633
My mom hates photos.

01:27:53.635 --> 01:27:54.901
It doesn't have
to be your mother.

01:27:54.903 --> 01:27:57.237
Jeez, Tony, think
outside the box.

01:27:57.239 --> 01:27:58.938
Come on, Tony, give it a shot.

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:01.441
No time to cook, frozen food

01:28:01.443 --> 01:28:02.676
like you've never had it before.

01:28:02.678 --> 01:28:05.545
Tonight, think outside the box.

01:28:05.547 --> 01:28:06.780
You know what,
the sacrifice thing

01:28:06.782 --> 01:28:08.481
didn't work out
very well for me.

01:28:08.483 --> 01:28:10.083
What do you mean?

01:28:10.085 --> 01:28:12.165
When you made sacrifices
for me, it worked out great.

01:28:13.521 --> 01:28:17.257
Hey, Sofia, your
husband still loves you.

01:28:23.831 --> 01:28:25.231
Does anybody want Espresso?

01:28:25.233 --> 01:28:26.733
That'd be nice.

01:28:34.175 --> 01:28:36.376
I used to come here
when my parents would fight.

01:28:37.545 --> 01:28:40.013
To clear my head.

01:28:41.549 --> 01:28:43.983
It wouldn't have
to be like that.

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:45.785
You think they were
always like that?

01:28:46.387 --> 01:28:48.188
They were in love once too.

01:28:50.725 --> 01:28:52.192
Do you still love me?

01:28:52.194 --> 01:28:54.928
That's like asking
me if I love my family.

01:28:56.263 --> 01:28:57.997
Meaning?

01:28:58.766 --> 01:29:02.836
You're my family, Tony, but

01:29:03.804 --> 01:29:05.338
part of family is

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:07.874
knowing what to keep and

01:29:09.443 --> 01:29:11.111
what to leave behind.

01:29:15.015 --> 01:29:16.983
Hey, you hated my hair anyway.

01:29:17.618 --> 01:29:19.219
I was getting used to it.

01:29:20.121 --> 01:29:22.789
Leaving you is not
going to be easy, is it?

01:29:23.924 --> 01:29:25.859
If I could stop you, I would.

01:29:44.378 --> 01:29:46.746
Look, I know
the Bellafusco girl

01:29:46.748 --> 01:29:49.082
likes more than your cupcakes.

01:29:49.084 --> 01:29:51.751
Now let me just tell
you, if you help me out,

01:29:51.753 --> 01:29:54.087
there's something in it for you.

01:29:54.089 --> 01:29:56.289
Maybe a whole lot of something.

01:29:56.291 --> 01:29:58.625
She don't bring her
cannoli around here no more.

01:29:58.627 --> 01:30:00.593
Wait. What?

01:30:00.595 --> 01:30:02.362
Oh, fuck it.

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:07.934
