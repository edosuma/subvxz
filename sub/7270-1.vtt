02:32.733 --> 02:34.733
YOUR HONOR, I CANNOT
COMPLETE MY EXAMINATION

02:34.733 --> 02:36.300
IF THIS IDIOT GOES

03:24.933 --> 03:27.033
LEAN FORWARD AND PUT YOUR
HANDS UP AGAINST THE WALL

03:27.033 --> 03:28.633
AND FREEZE THERE.

03:28.633 --> 03:29.867
WHERE'S
THE WEAPON?

03:29.867 --> 03:31.867
WEAPON?

03:31.867 --> 03:32.867
IT'S A BIBLE.

03:32.867 --> 03:34.033
MAYBE THERE'S
A GUN IN IT.

03:34.033 --> 03:35.733
WHO DO YOU WORK FOR,
THE GANGS?

03:35.733 --> 03:37.367
AHH, IT'S JUST A BIBLE,
WHERE'S THE GUN?

03:37.367 --> 03:39.033
I DON'T
HAVE A GUN.

03:39.033 --> 03:40.600
I'M A MINISTER.

03:40.600 --> 03:41.967
THOSE ARE MY
ORDINATION PAPERS.

03:41.967 --> 03:43.767

03:50.967 --> 03:53.467
I'M TRYING TO GET
PERMISSION FROM THE JUDGE

03:53.467 --> 03:54.767
TO HELP THOSE KIDS.

03:54.767 --> 03:56.367

HOW DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN HELP THOSE KIDS?

04:05.600 --> 04:07.600
I'VE GOT A WHOLE CHURCH FULL
OF PEOPLE PRAYING FOR THEM

04:07.600 --> 04:09.033
BACK IN PHILIPSBURG,
PENNSYLVANIA.

04:09.033 --> 04:11.133
[LAUGHTER]
THEY BETTER BE PRAYING
FOR A MIRACLE

04:11.133 --> 04:14.867
BECAUSE THE D.A. WILL
BURN THOSE CREEPS.

04:14.867 --> 04:17.399
(POLICEMAN) GIVE
HIM BACK HIS BIBLE.

04:19.433 --> 04:21.067
ALRIGHT, THE JUDGE SAID
HE WON'T PRESS ANY CHARGES

04:21.067 --> 04:23.733
IF YOU AGREE NOT
TO COME BACK HERE ANYMORE.

04:23.733 --> 04:25.400
NOW WHAT DO YOU SAY?

04:29.367 --> 04:30.100
WHAT THE HELL.

04:30.100 --> 04:32.667

04:36.767 --> 04:37.967
YOU ASHAMED
OF IT?

04:37.967 --> 04:39.867
OF COURSE NOT.

04:39.867 --> 04:42.467
STOP HIDING IT THEN.
HOLD IT UP WHERE WE CAN SEE IT.

06:19.533 --> 06:21.833
HE DON'T LOOK

08:43.967 --> 08:45.967
I TOOK THESE SHOES
OFF OF A WINO.

08:45.967 --> 08:48.233
HE MUST A HAD ATHLETE'S
FEET OR SOMETHING,

08:48.233 --> 08:50.800
'CAUSE I'M ALWAYS ITCHING.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.267
MAU MAUS, HUH?

09:10.400 --> 09:13.200
I JUST WORRY ABOUT
THE PIGS AND HUSTLIN' BREAD.

09:13.200 --> 09:16.300
EASY FOR YOU

09:16.300 --> 09:19.433
A RICH MAN LIKE YOU

09:23.900 --> 09:26.967

09:26.967 --> 09:28.767
YOU'RE ON HIS
MIND RIGHT NOW.

09:28.767 --> 09:30.400

10:15.100 --> 10:16.900
THAT YOU COULD SPRINKLE
THE GRASS

10:16.900 --> 10:18.833
IN WHICH-EM-A-CALL-IT,
PENNSYLVANIA,

10:18.833 --> 10:21.000
JUST BY DRINKING
A GLASS OF WATER.

10:41.333 --> 10:44.133
THIS TURF BELONGS
TO THE A.A.A.G.P.

10:44.133 --> 10:47.267
THEY GOT A PEACE TREATY WITH
THE BISHOPS AND THE MAU MAUS.

10:47.267 --> 10:50.367
THEY DON'T RUMBLE ANYHOW,
THEY JUST FREAK OUT.

10:50.367 --> 10:52.800
WHAT'S THE A.A.A.G.P.?

10:52.800 --> 10:57.767
THAT'S THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION
FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF GANGS
AND POT!

11:04.400 --> 11:05.333
YOU BETTER
PARK HERE.

11:05.333 --> 11:07.367
THIS IS ABOUT AS CLOSE
AS YOU'RE GOING TO GET

11:07.367 --> 11:09.267
AND STILL KEEP
YOUR CAR.

11:26.033 --> 11:29.333
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA WISH
YOU STILL HAD YOUR SHOES.

11:33.867 --> 11:43.933
MUSIC

11:43.933 --> 12:04.033
MUSIC

12:04.033 --> 12:24.000
MUSIC

12:24.000 --> 12:42.533
MUSIC

12:42.533 --> 12:44.433
IT'S WATER.

12:44.433 --> 12:46.267
WE WERE LUCKY.

12:46.267 --> 12:54.800
HEY, ANGELA!
ANGIE, IT'S ME BO.

13:06.167 --> 13:07.067
HELLO,
WHERE YOU BEEN?

13:07.067 --> 13:09.133
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU AROUND
IN A LONG TIME.

13:09.133 --> 13:10.133
YOU DON'T
KNOW HIM.

13:10.133 --> 13:11.767
YOU JUST SEEN HIS PICTURE
IN THE PAPER.

13:11.767 --> 13:15.633
THIS IS THE PREACHER THAT
GOT HIMSELF BUSTED AT THE
EGYPTIAN KINGS TRIAL.

13:15.633 --> 13:17.367
OH...

13:17.367 --> 13:20.233
(BO) LEAVE HIM ALONE.
THAT'S HIS THING.

13:20.233 --> 13:23.167
AND DON'T GO TRYIN' TO TURN
A TRICK ON HIM.

13:23.167 --> 13:25.200
HE POPPED THAT SAME SMILE
ON ME AN' BOTTLECAP.

13:25.200 --> 13:28.067
HEY, HE WANTS TO MEET
THE GANG.

13:28.067 --> 13:29.667
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE HIM INSIDE?

13:29.667 --> 13:30.933
I CAN'T.

13:30.933 --> 13:33.400
THE MAU MAUS WAITIN' FOR A
WAR COUNCIL WITH THE BISHOPS.

13:33.400 --> 13:34.567
MY BROTHER'S INSIDE.

13:34.567 --> 13:36.367
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, BO,
WE'LL GO IN.

13:36.367 --> 13:39.367
OH, NOW WAIT A MINUTE.
MAYBE IT'S BETTER IF I DON'T.

13:39.367 --> 13:40.667
LIKE I SAID,
I'M LONER.

13:40.667 --> 13:43.433
I JUST RUN DISPATCHES
FOR ONE GANG OR ANOTHER,

13:43.433 --> 13:45.400
BUT IF I WAS TO JUST WALK
RIGHT IN THE CLUBHOUSE,

13:45.400 --> 13:47.067
THEY MIGHT NOT
LIKE IT.

13:47.067 --> 13:49.367
YOU'RE JUST AFRAID
THEY MIGHT CUT YOU.

13:49.367 --> 13:50.567
OH, GO ON.
TAKE HIM IN.

13:50.567 --> 13:55.333
UH HUH. I AIN'T GONNA
GET BAWLED OUT-

13:55.333 --> 13:58.300
UNLESS YOU GIVE ME
FIVE DOLLARS.

13:58.300 --> 14:01.300
GO ON, YOU CAN TURN HIM LOOSE
JUST INSIDE THE DOOR.

14:01.300 --> 14:04.400
FIVE DOLLARS
IS MY PRICE.

14:08.467 --> 14:10.100
LET'S COOL IT,
DAVEY BABY.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.267
FIVE BUCKS IS THIS
CHICK'S TOP PRICE.

14:12.267 --> 14:14.167
FOR THAT YOU GET TWO
JOINTS OF MARIJUANA,

14:14.167 --> 14:16.600
HER BODY,
AND TWO BITS CHANGE.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.633
SHOULD I GIVE HER
SOME MONEY?

14:19.633 --> 14:22.267
TWO BUCKS TOPS.

14:22.267 --> 14:25.033
YOU BETTER
MAKE IT THREE.

14:25.033 --> 14:27.033
YOU DON'T WANNA
INSULT HER PRIDE.

14:30.200 --> 14:34.100
THAT CAT COULD
ONLY SWING TWO.

14:36.433 --> 14:38.433
COME ON.

14:38.433 --> 14:40.567
LATER,
DAVEY BABY.

14:40.567 --> 14:42.167
I'M GONNA GO STEAL
ME SOME BREAKFAST.

14:42.167 --> 14:44.333

I LOVED YOU, NICKY.
AND I WAS GOOD FOR YOU.

48:47.300 --> 48:51.733
NOW YOU LOVE THE NEEDLE
AND YOU'RE GOOD FOR NOTHING.

48:51.733 --> 48:54.300
PLEASE, NICKY.

48:54.300 --> 48:56.033
PLEASE WHAT?

48:56.033 --> 48:58.533
GIVE ME THE MONEY.

48:58.533 --> 49:00.467
YOU'RE REALLY
DESPERATE, HUH?

49:00.467 --> 49:03.633
LIKE I'M DOWN.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

49:03.633 --> 49:06.567
YOU WANT ME
TO STRAIGHTEN YOU, HUH?

49:06.567 --> 49:12.300
OH NICKY, WOULD YOU?
WOULD YOU?

49:12.300 --> 49:14.600
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE PREACHER?

49:14.600 --> 49:16.367
HE'S OKAY.
HE WANTS TO HELP PEOPLE.

49:16.367 --> 49:19.567
NO! HE WANTS
TO BREAK UP THE GANG.

49:19.567 --> 49:21.367
WHY WOULD HE
WANT TO DO THAT?

49:21.367 --> 49:22.733
BECAUSE
HE'S A FANATIC!

49:22.733 --> 49:24.767
BECAUSE HE'S GOT
A ONE-RACK MIND.

49:24.767 --> 49:27.233
HE'S GOTTA CONVERT
EVERYBODY.

49:27.233 --> 49:29.233
SO WHERE DOES THAT
LEAVE YOU, HUH?

49:29.233 --> 49:30.633
WITHOUT ANY GANGS
TO MOOCH FROM

49:30.633 --> 49:33.267
YOU'D HAVE TO WHORE
FOR YOUR HAIT.

49:33.267 --> 49:36.833
THINK HOW BORING
THAT'D BE.

49:36.833 --> 49:40.567
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

49:50.200 --> 49:53.400
I WANT YOU TO GET
RID OF THE PREACHER.

49:53.400 --> 49:55.233
HOW?

49:55.233 --> 49:56.667
HOWEVER.

49:56.667 --> 50:01.067

BALL 'IM, I DON'T CARE.

50:01.067 --> 50:03.433
NICK, NO.

50:03.433 --> 50:04.700
WITH HIM OUT
OF THE WAY,

50:04.700 --> 50:06.400
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

50:06.400 --> 50:08.167
I'LL SEE TO IT.

50:08.167 --> 50:10.667
NICKY, YOU'RE
TEASING ME.

50:10.667 --> 50:14.300
YOU CAN HAVE ALL
THE JUNK YOU EVER WANT.

50:14.300 --> 50:18.200
YOU CAN EVEN BE
MY GIRL AGAIN.

50:18.200 --> 50:22.700
OH MY GOD, NICKY,
WHAT A MESS WE'RE IN.

50:22.700 --> 50:25.267
YOU GONNA DO IT?

50:25.267 --> 50:27.433
YEAH, BUT
STRAIGHTEN ME FIRST.

50:27.433 --> 50:28.367
UH HUH.

50:28.367 --> 50:31.167
DO THE JOB FIRST.
THEN I'LL STRAIGHTEN YOU.

50:31.167 --> 50:33.367
I CAN'T.
I NEED TO GET FIXED.

50:33.367 --> 50:38.133
I'M SHAKIN' SO I CAN'T
EVEN HOLD A KNIFE.

50:43.867 --> 50:48.367
OKAY, BABY,
FORGET IT.

50:48.367 --> 50:54.333
OH NO, GIMME THE KNIFE, NICKY.
I'LL DO IT.

51:11.433 --> 51:12.867
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE STUFF IS WORTH?

51:12.867 --> 51:14.033
FEW BUCKS.

51:14.033 --> 51:15.800
WE SHOULDDA CLOBBERED THE GUY
AND SEARCHED THE WHOLE PAD.

51:15.800 --> 51:17.433
I BET HE HAD TONS
OF BREAD

51:17.433 --> 51:18.667
HIDDEN IN THEM CLOSETS
IN HIS SHOES.

51:18.667 --> 51:19.767
OR IN HIS
YARMALKE.

51:19.767 --> 51:24.467
HEY!
LOOK AT THIS.

51:24.467 --> 51:26.633
IT WAS IN HIS
JEWEL BOX.

51:26.633 --> 51:28.233
THE GUY'S
A CATHOLIC!

51:28.233 --> 51:32.233
THIS WORTH
ANYTHING?

51:32.233 --> 51:33.767
WE GOTTA
TAKE IT BACK.

51:33.767 --> 51:35.667
TAKE IT BACK?

51:35.667 --> 51:37.733
IT'S BAD LUCK
TO STEAL A CRUCIFIX.

51:37.733 --> 51:39.600
YEAH, 'CAUSE YA CAN'T
GET NOTHIN' FOR IT.

51:39.600 --> 51:41.800
YOU SHUT
YOUR MOUTH!

51:41.800 --> 51:43.700
MAYBE WE COULD TAKE IT
TO THE HOSPITAL

51:43.700 --> 51:45.500
AND GIVE IT
TO MINGO.

51:45.500 --> 51:46.433
ARE YOU CRAZY?

51:46.433 --> 51:47.633
HE DOESN'T
EVEN SEE US.

51:47.633 --> 51:48.967
HOW IS HE GOING
TO SEE THIS THING?

51:48.967 --> 51:50.267
HE CAN FEEL
WHAT IT IS.

51:50.267 --> 51:51.533
HE DON'T
FEEL NOTHIN'.

51:51.533 --> 51:52.733
YEAH,
THAT'S RIGHT.

51:52.733 --> 51:55.833
HE STILL IN A -- COMA?

51:55.833 --> 51:57.267

52:01.433 --> 52:04.267
WHAT?

52:04.267 --> 52:06.833
SOMEBODY'S
IN THE CLUBROOM.

52:06.833 --> 52:08.700
I'LL GO.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.033
IT'S NICKY.

52:17.033 --> 52:18.367

52:18.367 --> 52:19.700
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?
WHAT AM I, HIS MUDDER?

52:23.433 --> 52:24.567
WHAT DO YOU CALL THESE?

52:24.567 --> 52:26.867
TOSTONES.

52:26.867 --> 52:28.633
HMM.
THESE ARE DELICIOUS.

52:28.633 --> 52:30.433
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
LIKE THIS IN PHILIPSBURG.

52:30.433 --> 52:32.400
MAYBE WE SHOULD
OPEN A MISSION THERE.

52:32.400 --> 52:33.600
SERIOUSLY, DAVID.

52:33.600 --> 52:35.433
YOU HAVE DONE WONDERS ALREADY
WITH THE KIDS IN THE STREET.

52:35.433 --> 52:37.667
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING WITH
A BAD BUNCH OF APPLES

52:37.667 --> 52:39.533
AND YOU GOT 'EM
SMILIN'.

52:39.533 --> 52:42.300
I DIDN'T
SEE NICKY SMILIN'.

52:42.300 --> 52:43.600
NICKY!

52:43.600 --> 52:45.367
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DEALING WITH

52:45.367 --> 52:47.267
WHEN YOU'RE DEALING
WITH NICKY?

52:47.267 --> 52:48.500
YEAH, BUT NONE
OF THEM ARE BREAKING.

52:48.500 --> 52:50.800
I GET TO THE POINT
WHERE I THINK I'M
REALLY GETTING THROUGH,

52:50.800 --> 52:52.467
THEY TURN ME OFF.

52:52.467 --> 52:53.933
THEY TURN YOU OFF
BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID

52:53.933 --> 52:55.600
OF BEING
CALLED CHICKEN.

52:55.600 --> 52:58.733
BEING THE GANG, FIGHTING,
STEALING, SHOOTING DOPE

52:58.733 --> 53:03.533
IS THEIR WAY OF PROVING
THAT THEY ARE A MAN.

53:03.533 --> 53:05.067
YEAH.

53:05.067 --> 53:09.600
MAYBE IF I COULD JUST GET 'EM
ALL TOGETHER IN ON BIG PLACE -

53:09.600 --> 53:11.067
GET THEM TO REALLY
COMMIT THEMSELVES

53:11.067 --> 53:14.533
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEIR FRIENDS
SO THEY COULDN'T TURN BACK.

53:14.533 --> 53:15.967
YOU MEAN
LIKE A RALLY?

53:15.967 --> 53:18.633
YEAH, A RALLY.

53:18.633 --> 53:22.067
A GANG RALLY WITH ALL
THE BEEBOPPERS, JITTERBUGGERS
AND EVERYBODY.

53:22.067 --> 53:23.600
NOW WAIT
A MINUTE.

53:23.600 --> 53:25.533
YOU CAN'T TACKLE A HORD
OF THE TOUGHEST GANGS

53:25.533 --> 53:27.000
IN NEW YORK
WITH A BIBLE.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.500
THEY'RE LIABLE
TO CRUCIFY YOU.

53:29.500 --> 53:30.600
WHERE COULD
WE GET A HALL?

53:30.600 --> 53:32.000
I THINK YOU JUST
LOST AN ARGUMENT.

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
WHAT KIND
OF A HALL?

53:33.000 --> 53:35.567
A BIG ONE, BIG ENOUGH
FOR EVERY GANG MEMBER

53:35.567 --> 53:36.633
AND JUNKIE
IN NEW YORK.

53:36.633 --> 53:37.767
THAT DON'T
TAKE A HALL.

53:37.767 --> 53:39.033
THAT TAKES
THE GRAND CANYON.

53:39.033 --> 53:40.900
WELL, I COULD
GET YOU A HALL.

53:40.900 --> 53:41.900
WILL IT BE
EXPENSIVE?

53:41.900 --> 53:43.633
NEVER MIND
ABOUT THAT.

53:43.633 --> 53:45.333
IF YOU'RE CRAZY
ENOUGH TO GO IN

53:45.333 --> 53:46.767
WITH THOSE FUZZY
FACED KILLERS,

53:46.767 --> 53:49.567
I'LL FIND SOMEBODY CRAZY
ENOUGH TO PAY THE BILL.

54:24.933 --> 54:26.400

54:26.400 --> 54:27.533
I MEAN
THE PREACHER.

54:27.533 --> 54:30.367

THINKIN' ABOUT HIM?

54:38.100 --> 54:41.533
WHAT'D YOU RAP ABOUT
THAT WAS SO INTERESTING?

54:41.533 --> 54:42.833

BY THE SCHOOL.

54:44.567 --> 54:46.900

HE CAME TO MY PLACE
AT 3 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING

54:54.567 --> 54:56.933
JUST TO TELL
ME THAT.

54:56.933 --> 54:59.433
I ALMOST HAD
A HEART ATTACK.

54:59.433 --> 55:03.500
IF HE WASN'T RIGHT ON MY
DOORSTEP, I'D A KILLED HIM.

55:03.500 --> 55:05.800
SO YOU KNOW
WHAT I DONE?

55:05.800 --> 55:08.633
I SENT ROSA OVER
TO KILL HIM.

55:08.633 --> 55:11.733
I GAVE HER THE KNIFE
AND EVERYTHING.

55:11.733 --> 55:14.667
NO KIDDING. HEY, YOU

01:34:49.133 --> 01:34:52.233
JESUS WAS A PACKAGE
OF PURE LOVE.

01:34:52.233 --> 01:34:58.033
SWEET, STRAIGHT LOVE.
FOR YOU AND FOR ME.

01:34:58.033 --> 01:35:00.933
I DON'T CARE
WHO YOU'VE CUT.

01:35:00.933 --> 01:35:03.400
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN SMOKIN' OR SHOOTING,

01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:06.333
I DON'T CARE WHO YOU
BEEN LAYIN' AROUND WITH,

01:35:06.333 --> 01:35:09.400
GOD LOVES
YOU ANYWAY.

01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:11.167
I KNOW EACH ONE
OF YOU HERE

01:35:11.167 --> 01:35:13.333
KNOWS ABOUT
THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.

01:35:13.333 --> 01:35:16.067
MOST OF YOU HAVE BROKEN
EVERY ONE OF 'EM.

01:35:16.067 --> 01:35:20.567
GOD KNOWS ABOUT THAT TOO.

01:35:20.567 --> 01:35:24.400
HE KNOWS ABOUT YOUR ANGERS,
YOU FEARS, YOUR FRUSTRATIONS.

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:26.900
HE KNOWS THAT MOST
OF YOU HAVE FOUGHT.

01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:31.300
SOME OF YOU HAVE
EVEN KILLED.

01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:34.500
BUT GOD ALSO KNOWS WHAT YOU
CAN BE LIKE IN THE FUTURE.

01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:37.233
NOT JUST WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN IN THE PAST.

01:35:37.233 --> 01:35:39.867
JESUS SAID THERE IS JUST
ONE GREAT COMMANDMENT.

01:35:39.867 --> 01:35:42.200
THAT YOU LOVE GOD WITH
ALL YOU HEART, YOUR SOUL,

01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:46.400
YOUR MIND AND YOUR
NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.

01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:49.100
HE SAID, "A NEW COMMANDMENT
I GIVE UNTO YOU

01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:54.300
THAT YOU LOVE
ONE ANOTHER.'

01:35:54.300 --> 01:36:01.133
I'M GONNA ASK GOD RIGHT NOW
FOR A MIRACLE.

01:36:01.133 --> 01:36:04.967
FATHER, I'M ASKIN'
YOU NOW FOR A MIRACLE,

01:36:04.967 --> 01:36:10.500
THAT IN THIS NEXT MOMENT
THESE LIVE WILL BE CHANGED.

01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:13.300
I'M ASKING YOU MAU MAUS
TO TURN AWAY FROM HATING

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:16.533
YOUR BLACK
BROTHERS.

01:36:16.533 --> 01:36:21.567
I'M ASKING YOU BISHOPS
TO FORGIVE THE WHITE MAN'S SIN-

01:36:21.567 --> 01:36:23.533
JUST AS GOD
FORGIVES YOURS.

01:36:23.533 --> 01:36:24.700
LOOK AT THIS,
PREACHER!

01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:26.267
SEE THIS HOLE
I GOT IN ME.

01:36:26.267 --> 01:36:28.200
IT CAME FROM ONE OF THEM
NIGGER ZIP GUNS,

01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:30.267
AND YOU SAY THAT I'M
SUPPOSED TO LOVE THEM.

01:36:30.267 --> 01:36:31.500
MAN, YOU'RE NOT REAL!

01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:32.400
HEY, MAN.

01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:34.333
MY BROTHER DIED FROM
A MAU MAU RUMBLE.

01:36:34.333 --> 01:36:36.367
AND YOU SAY YOU WANT ME
TO LOVE THEM HONKYS?

01:36:36.367 --> 01:36:38.033
YEAH, MAN,
I'M GONNA LOVE 'EM.

01:36:38.033 --> 01:36:40.067
I'M GONNA LOVE 'EM
WITH A SHARP BLADE.

01:36:40.067 --> 01:36:42.000
NOW YOU SHUT UP
AND LISTEN TO ME.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.633
YOU SAY YOU GOTTA
KILL THEM BECAUSE OF
WHAT THEY DID TO YOU.

01:36:44.633 --> 01:36:46.367
AND YOU'VE GOT TO KILL
THEM BECAUSE OF WHAT

01:36:46.367 --> 01:36:48.033
THEY'VE DONE TO YOU.

01:36:48.033 --> 01:36:50.333
EVERYBODY'S GRIPPING ABOUT
THIS ATROCITY AND THAT TRAGEDY.

01:36:50.333 --> 01:36:55.500
ALL I HEAR IS WHAT
A ROTTEN DEAL WE'VE ALL GOT.

01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:59.333
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
JESUS CHRIST WAS PERFECT!

01:36:59.333 --> 01:37:04.667
AND THEY
CRUCIFIED HIM!

01:37:04.667 --> 01:37:07.567
HE NEVER SAID ONE
COMPLAINING WORD.

01:37:07.567 --> 01:37:13.033
AND WHEN HE DIED ON THAT CROSS,
HE WAS A MAN!

01:37:13.033 --> 01:37:15.567
LIKE YOU, HE HAD
THE SAME FEARS

01:37:15.567 --> 01:37:17.767
AND THE SAME FEELINGS
THAT YOU HAVE.

01:37:17.767 --> 01:37:21.333
HE FELT PAIN JUST
THE WAY YOU FEEL PAIN.

01:37:21.333 --> 01:37:26.000
HE HAD THOSE NAILS DRIVEN
INTO THE FLESH OF THE HANDS.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:32.533
HIS HANDS, HIS HANDS, THE MOST
SENSITIVE PART OF HIS BODY.

01:37:32.533 --> 01:37:38.567
AND HIS FEET, THEY DROVE
A SPIKE INTO HIS FEET.

01:37:38.567 --> 01:37:44.067
AND THEY NAILED HIS HANDS
AND FEET TO THE CROSS.

01:37:44.067 --> 01:37:47.200
AND HE DIDN'T HAVE TO LET
THEM DO THAT TO HIM.

01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:49.433
HE COULD HAVE CALLED DOWN
A WHOLE LEGION OF ANGELS

01:37:49.433 --> 01:37:51.667
TO TAKE HIM DOWN
FROM THAT CROSS.

01:37:51.667 --> 01:37:54.700
HE COULD HAVE SLAUGHTERED
ALL HIS TORMENTORS.

01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:57.033
BUT HE DIDN'T.

01:37:57.033 --> 01:38:04.233
HE HUNG THERE.
BLEEDING. FOR YOU.

01:38:04.233 --> 01:38:10.333
AND HE DIED THERE.
FOR YOU.

01:38:10.333 --> 01:38:13.333
SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
TO DIE HERE TODAY.

01:38:13.333 --> 01:38:16.767
SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
TO KILL HERE TODAY.

01:38:16.767 --> 01:38:19.667
WHY DON'T YOU STOP CRYING
ABOUT THE SINS OF THE PAST.

01:38:19.667 --> 01:38:21.567
STOP PAYING
FOR THOSE SINS.

01:38:21.567 --> 01:38:24.567
MAN, IT'S ALL PAID UP.
IT'S FREE!

01:38:24.567 --> 01:38:27.233
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IT JUST ACCEPT IT.

01:38:27.233 --> 01:38:31.600
JUST OPEN UP YOUR
HEARTS AND LET ALL THAT
BITTERNESS RUN OUT.

01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:36.000
AND LET JESUS CHRIST
COME IN!

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.200
(ECHO THE VOICE OF PREACH)
JUST OPEN UP YOUR HEARTS
AND LET ALL THAT BITTERNESS

01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:42.500
RUN OUT AND LET
JESUS CHRIST COME IN...

01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:44.733
COME IN...COME IN...
COME IN...COME IN...

01:38:44.733 --> 01:38:47.400
COME IN...COME IN...

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:48.367
LISTEN!

01:38:48.367 --> 01:38:51.233
ALL YOU WHITE CATS!
AND ALL YOU BLACK CATS!

01:38:51.233 --> 01:38:52.633
LISTEN TO ME.

01:38:52.633 --> 01:38:55.367
NOW YOU BEEN HEARING
ABOUT THE POWER OF LOVE.

01:38:55.367 --> 01:38:57.467
WELL, I'M GOING TO TELL
YOU ABOUT ANOTHER POWER.

01:38:57.467 --> 01:38:59.100
IT'S GANG POWER.

01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:00.800
AND THAT'S
WHERE IT'S AT.

01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:04.533
NOW THE BISHOPS AND THE
MAU MAUS ARE HAVING IT
OUT HERE TONIGHT.

01:39:04.533 --> 01:39:07.300
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO BE IN ON IT.

01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:08.667
YOU CAN'T GET AWAY.

01:39:08.667 --> 01:39:11.367
ALL THE EXITS
ARE SHUT OFF.

01:39:11.367 --> 01:39:13.433
AND YOU MIGHT
AS WELL FACE IT, MAN,

01:39:13.433 --> 01:39:17.367
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE IT OUT
RIGHT HERE AND NOW!

01:39:17.367 --> 01:39:21.500
[SHOUTING WITH MUSIC]

01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:25.867
COOL IT.
I SAID COOL IT NOW!

01:39:25.867 --> 01:39:30.200
HASN'T THERE BEEN ENOUGH
KILLING AND CUTTING?!

01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:32.333
WEREN'T YOU LISTENIN'
TO THE PREACHER?

01:39:32.333 --> 01:39:37.400
WELL, I HEARD
THE PREACHER...

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:41.133
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SAY IT.

01:39:41.133 --> 01:39:45.767
HE'S HERE.
YOU FEEL HIM.

01:39:45.767 --> 01:39:50.667
YOU ALL FEEL HIM.

01:39:50.667 --> 01:39:56.767
HE'S HERE IN THIS ROOM
AND HE WANTS TO TOUCH YOU.

01:39:56.767 --> 01:40:03.333
IF YOU EVER WANT YOUR LIVES
CHANGED, NOW IS THE TIME.

01:40:03.333 --> 01:40:05.300
PUT YOUR WEAPONS AWAY.

01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:07.833
THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE
A RUMBLE HERE TONIGHT.

01:40:07.833 --> 01:40:12.133
YOU'RE IN THE PRESENCE
OF THE ALMIGHTY GOD.

01:40:12.133 --> 01:40:14.533
COME ON UP
HERE TOGETHER.

01:40:14.533 --> 01:40:17.433
STAND.
COME ON.

01:40:17.433 --> 01:40:19.200
NOT AS SAINTS.

01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:20.433
DON'T WAIT TILL
YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH

01:40:20.433 --> 01:40:22.500
BECAUSE THAT DAY'S
NEVER GONNA COME.

01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:23.733
COME ON.

01:40:23.733 --> 01:40:29.167
COME ON WITH ALL YOUR HANGUPS
AND LET JESUS CLEAN YOU UP.

01:40:29.167 --> 01:40:33.167
AND WOULD YOU COME.
LET YOUR COMING SAY IT.

01:40:33.167 --> 01:40:37.833

01:40:52.633 --> 01:40:54.600
HEY, MAN.

01:40:54.600 --> 01:41:00.333
I KNOW YOU GOT LOVE.
I CAN FEEL IT IN YA.

01:41:00.333 --> 01:41:02.833
'CAUSE I AIN'T SCARED
OF YOU NO MORE.

01:41:10.233 --> 01:41:11.700
NICKY!!

01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:20.333
MAN, I GOT YOUR LIFE

01:41:20.333 --> 01:41:31.833
I CAN TAKE IT AWAY,
OR I CAN GIVE IT BACK TO YOU...

01:41:31.833 --> 01:41:37.300
I'M GONNA GIVE IT
BACK TO YOU.

01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:43.667
WOW, MAN...

01:41:43.667 --> 01:41:49.433
I REALLY DON'T DIG THIS
SCENE TONIGHT AT ALL.

01:41:54.900 --> 01:42:00.333
GOD LOVES YOU,

01:42:00.333 --> 01:42:06.000
JUST AS YOU ARE
NOW STANDING THERE

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:11.800
IN YOUR COLD, DARK
AND BITTER, LITTLE WORLD,

01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:24.467
HE LOVES YOU, HE LOVES YOU
HIS HAND IS REACHING OUT...

01:42:24.467 --> 01:42:30.500
I'M GONNA GIVE
MY LIFE TO GOD, DAVEY.

01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:33.900
IT BETTER WORK 'CAUSE
I DAMN NEAR GOT KILLED FOR IT.

01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:38.800
...AND HIS LOVE IS STRONGER
THAN ANYTHING...

01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:41.267
THIS IS THE MIRACLE,
NICKY.

01:42:41.267 --> 01:42:43.300
THE MIRACLE I'VE
BEEN PRAYING FOR.

01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:47.567
GOD LOVES NICKY, TOO

01:42:47.567 --> 01:42:49.967
THIS IS THE MIRACLE
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

01:42:49.967 --> 01:42:52.000
THAT YOU'RE GONNA FIND
YOURSELVES TONIGHT.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.833
YOU'RE GONNA KNOW IN YOUR
HEARTS IT WAS A MIRACLE

01:42:54.833 --> 01:42:58.700
SO YOU'LL NEVER TRUST
IN YOU OWN FLESH AGAIN.

01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:05.733
BUT IN THE FLESH SACRIFICED
FOR YOU BY JESUS!

01:43:05.733 --> 01:43:07.800
I WANT YOU ALL
TO HAVE BIBLES.

01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:13.567

HOW ABOUT GIVIN' US ONE
OF THOSE BIG BOOKS

DIFFERENT, NICK.

01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:36.633
HOW?

BRIGHT.
ALL KINDS OF SHINEY.

01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:47.633

I'M DIFFERENT TOO.

01:43:51.433 --> 01:43:54.800
I KNOW.

01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:58.533
YOU KICED THE JUNK.

01:43:58.533 --> 01:44:01.767
OH, NICKY,
I'M FREE NOW.

01:44:01.767 --> 01:44:04.867
I'M REALLY FREE.

HEY!

01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:13.900
I'M ALL OVER
THIS BOOK!

01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:16.767
MY NAME
IS IN THE BIBLE!

01:44:19.033 --> 01:44:22.533
ISRAEL...ISRAEL...
ISRAEL...ISRAEL...

01:44:22.533 --> 01:44:25.000
I'M PRACTICALLY
ON EVERY PAGE.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:28.433
[LAUGHTER]

01:44:34.867 --> 01:44:37.000
[PREACHER SPEAKING]
SO THIS WAS THE BEGINNING.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.100
THE BREAKTHROUGH THAT WAS
TO MAKE THE GHETTO MY CHURCH.

01:44:40.100 --> 01:44:43.600
LITTLE DID I KNOW IT
WAS GOING TO LEAD TO
OUR OWN CENTER,

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:45.867
A HOME WHERE LONELY,
MIXED UP KIDS

01:44:45.867 --> 01:44:49.033
COULD BE GIVEN
A NEW BEGINNING.

01:44:49.033 --> 01:44:52.433
OR THAT FROM THE
TORTURED STREETS OF
HARLEM AND BROOKLYN,

01:44:52.433 --> 01:44:53.767
THE TEEN CHALLENGE
CONCEPT WOULD SPREAD

01:44:53.767 --> 01:44:55.100
ACROSS THE LAND
TO OTHER CITIES,

01:44:55.100 --> 01:45:00.100
TO OTHER NICKYS
AND ISRAELS AND ROSAS.

01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:06.900
SURROUNDING THEM WITH LOVE
INSTEAD OF HATE AND FEAR.

01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:09.800
ONE THING
I ALREADY KNEW,

01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:11.900
IN THE BATTLE FOR SOULS
THAT SURGES THROUGH

01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:14.467
THE TENEMENT LINED ALLEYS
AND THE BACK STREET,

01:45:14.467 --> 01:45:16.800
YOU CAN TAKE IT FROM
THIS SKINNY PREACHER

01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:19.100
FROM THE HILLS
OF PENNSYLVANIA,

01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:23.800
THE CROSS IS MIGHTIER
THAN THE SWITCHBLADE.
