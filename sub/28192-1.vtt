WEBVTT

00:20.121 --> 00:22.788
- You looking forward to finally
decorating your own house?

00:22.890 --> 00:26.525
- Yeah. Looking forward to a
whole new set of furniture too.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.061
- Yeah, well, like I said,
go on a shopping spree

00:29.096 --> 00:31.830
and make this house the most
beautiful house on the block.

00:31.932 --> 00:34.566
- I will. But first we have
to get it painted, right?

00:34.602 --> 00:36.001
- Yeah. That should be fun.

00:38.072 --> 00:39.705
- This is one swanky
neighborhood.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.041
- Kat! Yay! You made it!

00:42.076 --> 00:44.243
- Of course. What's the point
of having a sister

00:44.278 --> 00:46.045
if she's not going
to help you unpack?

00:46.080 --> 00:47.346
- Agree.
- And from the looks of it,

00:47.448 --> 00:48.647
you need all the help
you can get.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.182
- Yeah.
- This place is gigantic.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.750
Yeah, well,

00:51.786 --> 00:53.519
you can't live in a dingy
old condo forever.

00:53.621 --> 00:55.087
- You can take that one.

00:55.122 --> 00:57.489
- This isn't too heavy.
- Okay, go ahead.

00:57.591 --> 00:58.991
- Oh, my gosh.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.526
- I'll find a spot
for those later.

01:00.628 --> 01:03.095
- Wow. Look at this.

01:03.130 --> 01:05.096
- Isn't this amazing?
- Yes.

01:05.132 --> 01:07.533
- These hardwood floors...
is this marble?

01:07.635 --> 01:09.301
- No, it's quartz,
but close.

01:09.336 --> 01:12.271
Look at this.
Six ranges, all right?

01:12.306 --> 01:14.473
Stainless steel, white.

01:14.508 --> 01:15.874
Come here,
check this out.

01:15.976 --> 01:17.376
- Grant, this is nice.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.311
- Double oven.
Stainless steel also.

01:19.346 --> 01:21.747
Yeah, go ahead and put that
over by the fireplace

01:21.782 --> 01:23.082
right over here.

01:23.117 --> 01:24.550
- I cannot wait
to cook over here.

01:24.652 --> 01:25.851
- Oh, wait till you see
the outside.

01:25.953 --> 01:27.453
- Are you serious?
There's more?

01:27.488 --> 01:30.122
- Ta-da!
- This is pretty awesome.

01:30.157 --> 01:32.658
You guys definitely need
to get a dog.

01:32.693 --> 01:35.427
And I need to be the official
puppy-sitter.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.463
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
one step at a time, okay?

01:37.498 --> 01:39.231
- Wow.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.468
- That must have been left here
by the previous owners.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.636
I am so sorry.
Hey, can we get someone

01:44.672 --> 01:46.872
to get those toys
out of here, please?

01:50.010 --> 01:53.612
- How's Grant
handling everything?

01:53.647 --> 01:55.481
- He has his way.

01:56.517 --> 01:57.916
- Okay.

01:58.018 --> 02:00.285
So, I guess things
are getting better?

02:03.057 --> 02:04.590
I don't know.

02:04.692 --> 02:05.891
Ever since we lost the baby,

02:05.993 --> 02:08.926
Grant just wants me
to move on.

02:09.029 --> 02:11.630
But I don't know
if I can.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.999
Honestly, Kat,
I don't know if things

02:14.034 --> 02:15.801
are ever going to be
the same between us.

02:16.837 --> 02:19.204
I am so sorry.
Come here.

02:30.384 --> 02:31.817
- Oh, my gosh.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.576
- Yes, of course
I'm here for you. Come on.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.044
No, we have to move
on this deposition.

02:59.079 --> 03:00.279
- Grant!

03:00.381 --> 03:01.747
- Okay, so,
what you got to do is--

03:01.782 --> 03:03.482
- Grant!

03:13.427 --> 03:20.432
<i>♪ ♪</i>

03:21.101 --> 03:22.901
- Knock, knock! Lori?

03:22.937 --> 03:24.169
Oh!

03:24.271 --> 03:25.604
- Oh. Hello.
- I'm sorry.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.105
Uh, I'm Rachel.

03:27.141 --> 03:28.373
We met at the Christmas party
last year.

03:28.409 --> 03:29.641
- Rachel.

03:29.743 --> 03:30.976
- We live three houses down.

03:31.078 --> 03:32.211
We're neighbors.

03:32.246 --> 03:34.913
- Yeah, Grant told me.

03:36.450 --> 03:39.218
- Oh, my, you certainly have
a room with a view,

03:39.253 --> 03:40.552
don't you?

03:40.588 --> 03:43.288
That's Noah Cranor.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.958
God, he likes to show off,
doesn't he?

03:45.993 --> 03:47.893
- Seems that way.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.728
- Want me to introduce you guys?

03:49.763 --> 03:53.699
- Oh, no. Gosh, I've got
my hands full right now.

03:53.801 --> 03:57.002
- Oh, yes. I remember how it was
when we first moved in.

03:57.104 --> 03:59.071
It stresses me out
just thinking about it,

03:59.106 --> 04:01.073
which is why
I brought you this.

04:01.108 --> 04:03.075
- You didn't have
to do that.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.810
- Well, it's just a little
housewarming

04:04.845 --> 04:08.046
I thought we'd enjoy tonight
over dinner at our place.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.581
- Dinner?

04:09.617 --> 04:11.350
You don't have to go
through that trouble, really.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.185
- It's really no trouble.

04:13.287 --> 04:14.453
See you at 6:00?

04:14.488 --> 04:15.721
- All right. Thank you.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.154
Okay.

04:23.163 --> 04:28.734
- So, Lori, have you met
any of the other neighbors?

04:28.836 --> 04:31.637
- She certainly has.
She met Noah.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.538
- Oh, Noah. Who's Noah?

04:33.641 --> 04:35.274
- Noah Cranor.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.409
He owns the house across
the street from you guys.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.677
He's always working
in his garage,

04:38.712 --> 04:40.746
usually with
his shirt off.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.247
- You met that guy?

04:42.349 --> 04:44.283
- I didn't actually meet him.

04:44.318 --> 04:47.452
I just saw him
in the garage, working.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.920
- Mm-hmm.

04:49.023 --> 04:51.156
- He does carpentry
and woodworking

04:51.191 --> 04:52.457
in his garage
as a hobby.

04:52.493 --> 04:53.759
- Hmm.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.494
- Yeah, he did our gazebo
out back.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.696
You should check it out.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.598
- He's really good
with his hands.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.167
- Well, you know,
we're thinking about

05:02.202 --> 05:03.835
putting a deck out
by our pool.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.337
Right, babe?

05:05.372 --> 05:07.773
I mean, maybe you can run
some ideas by him.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.608
- Sure.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.143
- Cheers.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.680
Cheers.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.248
- The first time we saw
this neighborhood,

05:16.350 --> 05:19.418
we just absolutely
fell in love with it.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.219
The golf course
here is amazing.

05:21.255 --> 05:23.055
You can't see it now, but in
the daytime it's beautiful.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.623
I can't wait for you
to play the back nine.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.158
- Yeah, I can't wait.

05:26.193 --> 05:28.493
- Looks like they're becoming
fast friends.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.296
Yeah, she seems happy.

05:31.398 --> 05:32.731
That makes me happy.

05:35.402 --> 05:38.503
- So, um, what's going on
between you two?

05:38.539 --> 05:39.838
- What do you mean?

05:39.873 --> 05:41.506
- Come on.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.709
- Is it that obvious?

05:43.744 --> 05:45.010
- Yeah.

05:46.413 --> 05:48.547
It's complicated.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.882
Lost a baby last year.

05:52.086 --> 05:54.219
Five months pregnant.

05:54.254 --> 05:56.655
Things haven't
been the same since.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.890
We've just kind of
drifted apart.

05:58.926 --> 06:01.660
I thought maybe buying the house
might change things,

06:01.762 --> 06:04.496
but, you know,
I don't know.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.833
- Sorry to hear
about that.

06:09.269 --> 06:10.402
- Thanks.

06:10.437 --> 06:11.870
- But...

06:11.905 --> 06:15.574
I might have just the answer
to your problem.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.509
- Oh, yeah?

06:17.611 --> 06:18.744
- Mm-hmm.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.011
- Do tell.

06:20.114 --> 06:21.913
- It's a little
different.

06:21.949 --> 06:24.116
So you have to keep
an open mind.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.955
- He is very proper
and particular...

06:38.632 --> 06:41.700
- So, what do you think
of Derek and Rachel?

06:41.802 --> 06:43.402
- They seem really nice.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.836
- Okay.
- Yeah.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.705
- Yeah, I think we could
become good friends.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.273
- Yeah.

07:11.832 --> 07:15.500
- Ooh, relax.
It's just me.

07:15.536 --> 07:18.370
What's so interesting
out there?

07:18.472 --> 07:20.071
- Just looking at the sky.

07:20.174 --> 07:21.807
So many stars out there.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.586
Our first night
in our new house.

07:40.828 --> 07:43.462
Derek and Rachel invited us
to a party on Friday.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.797
- Really? So soon?
- Mm-hmm.

07:45.833 --> 07:48.166
Well, except this is at
another couple's house.

07:48.202 --> 07:49.868
It's three streets away.

07:49.903 --> 07:53.338
I guess this group gets
together, like, once a month.

07:53.373 --> 07:55.907
Always the same people.

07:56.009 --> 07:59.211
It's a very
private thing.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.714
- Why is it so private?

08:02.749 --> 08:05.484
- This group of people is...

08:05.519 --> 08:08.954
they have certain
interests.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.288
- Okay.

08:10.390 --> 08:12.457
Um...

08:12.559 --> 08:17.128
they like to share intimate
experiences with each other.

08:19.867 --> 08:22.534
Romantic experiences.

08:22.569 --> 08:27.205
- Are you telling me that
Derek and Rachel are swingers?

08:27.241 --> 08:31.243
And that they have invited us
to a swinger party?

08:31.278 --> 08:33.678
- Yeah. And, look,
before you say no,

08:33.714 --> 08:34.980
I want you
to think about it.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.214
- You are considering this.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.448
I cannot believe this.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.317
Derek blindsided me
with this today,

08:39.419 --> 08:40.852
and I had the same
reaction you did.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.721
And then I thought about it--

08:42.756 --> 08:44.723
- About sleeping with Rachel?
Is that what this is about?

08:44.758 --> 08:47.058
- No, that if we open up
our relationship,

08:47.094 --> 08:48.894
it'll be good for us.

08:48.929 --> 08:52.731
You and I both know
that things have been difficult.

08:52.766 --> 08:55.066
Ever since we lost the...

08:57.104 --> 08:58.937
we have grown apart.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.339
- I know.

09:02.409 --> 09:03.842
I'm sorry, I'm just...

09:05.479 --> 09:07.012
I'm still dealing
with it.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.247
- I know.

09:09.283 --> 09:14.519
But I think that this is a way
for us to come back together.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.728
It worked out
for Derek and Rachel.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.564
- How?
- Look, they were in a bad spot

09:25.599 --> 09:27.566
a couple of years ago,
just like us.

09:27.601 --> 09:30.769
Then they went to this thing,
and it saved their marriage.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.137
Ask Rachel.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.205
- No. I am not going
to ask Rachel

09:34.308 --> 09:35.774
something like that.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.375
And, honestly,
I cannot believe

09:37.477 --> 09:39.844
that you're actually
considering this.

09:39.947 --> 09:42.113
- Why not?
- Because it's cheating.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.583
- It is not cheating
if both of us are involved.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.551
And we get to pick
the boundaries here.

09:46.653 --> 09:49.254
- Wow. So you have just already
made up your mind about this.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.689
Unbelievable.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.391
- No. We're just talking.

09:53.493 --> 09:55.594
- Why would I want
to sleep with another man?

09:55.629 --> 09:57.262
I love you.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.097
- And I love you too.

10:01.001 --> 10:03.635
But this is something
that we can experience together.

10:03.670 --> 10:06.538
I'll be thinking about you,
and you'll be thinking about me.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.740
- Right, you'll be having sex
with another woman,

10:08.842 --> 10:10.442
thinking about me?

10:10.477 --> 10:11.843
- Yes.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.245
- I don't know.

10:14.348 --> 10:15.947
It all sounds risky.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.783
Something could happen.
So many things could happen.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.820
- Honey, I promise,
nothing bad is going to happen.

10:21.855 --> 10:24.823
I just want us
to come back together again.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.625
The way we used to be.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.127
- I want that too.

10:29.162 --> 10:32.664
- Then I think at least
we should give this a try.

10:32.699 --> 10:36.267
I mean, nothing else
has seemed to work.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.678
- I could never do this.

10:47.714 --> 10:49.147
I'm sorry.

10:51.718 --> 10:53.385
- So that's your answer?

10:54.521 --> 10:56.021
- That's my answer.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.858
- Okay.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.196
- So, what now?
Where are you going?

11:05.232 --> 11:06.498
- I have some work
I have to do.

11:06.533 --> 11:07.866
- Really?

11:07.901 --> 11:09.534
- Good night.

11:09.569 --> 11:11.536
I'll see you
in the morning.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.782
- Hey, honey.
About last night...

11:23.884 --> 11:25.517
- It's okay.
Let's just forget about it.

11:25.552 --> 11:28.353
Oh, uh, I got to work late,
so...

11:28.388 --> 11:29.788
- What about dinner?

11:29.890 --> 11:31.690
- I'll just pick
something up.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.943
How's the run?

11:52.045 --> 11:53.678
- Good.

11:53.714 --> 11:55.213
- I'm Noah.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.348
I live just across
the street from you.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.384
- I'm Lori.
I... saw you.

11:59.419 --> 12:00.985
In the garage.

12:01.088 --> 12:03.621
My husband is Grant.

12:03.724 --> 12:05.323
- How was the first night
in the house?

12:05.425 --> 12:06.591
- Quiet.

12:06.626 --> 12:07.992
Not like the city at all.

12:08.095 --> 12:11.062
It's like crickets
in a star-filled sky.

12:11.098 --> 12:14.065
- Lots of other things
to look at too.

12:15.936 --> 12:18.169
I'm sure we'll see
each other around.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.971
You have a good run.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.584
- Wow, who knew the burbs
were so exciting?

12:32.619 --> 12:34.119
What did the guys look like?
Are they cute?

12:34.154 --> 12:36.488
- Kat, this is not
a college dorm, okay?

12:36.623 --> 12:38.323
These are married men.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.924
- Well, they make
the best lovers.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.560
I mean, so I've heard.
I--I don't know.

12:44.297 --> 12:47.098
I feel like Grant
is so set on this

12:47.134 --> 12:50.268
that if I don't do it,
I risk losing him.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.570
- So you're open
to the idea?

12:54.975 --> 12:57.308
Look, if he wanted
to cheat on you,

12:57.344 --> 12:58.877
he'd just do it
behind your back.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.446
He's actually
empowering you.

13:01.481 --> 13:02.747
He's putting you in charge,

13:02.783 --> 13:04.149
letting you set
the ground rules.

13:04.184 --> 13:05.917
I think it's kind of sweet.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.319
You should just try it,
see how it goes.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.021
And if you don't like it, if
you're uncomfortable,

13:10.157 --> 13:11.623
don't do it again,
forget it.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.691
- But these people
are my neighbors, you know?

13:13.827 --> 13:16.594
I feel like once we do it,
there's no going back.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.630
Plus, what if he likes it
and I don't?

13:18.665 --> 13:20.732
- Then it was never
about the two of you.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.100
It was just about him
getting permission

13:22.135 --> 13:23.701
to sleep with the bimbo
down the street.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.436
And if that's the case,
good riddance.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.508
Look, it might all work out
just like he said.

13:30.544 --> 13:33.378
It might even bring you two
closer together.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.979
And save your marriage.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.148
At least think about it.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.237
Lori?

13:59.339 --> 14:00.805
- Hey.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.479
- I apologize for last night.

14:08.515 --> 14:09.848
I don't know
what I was thinking.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.082
- You want to save
our marriage

14:11.184 --> 14:13.117
by any means necessary.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.486
- Lori, I--
- I'll do it.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.188
- What?

14:17.224 --> 14:18.957
- These are the rules.

14:19.059 --> 14:23.328
First, we both have to approve
each other's partners.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.130
I agree on yours,
you agree on mine.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.765
- Okay.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.634
- Second, either one of us

14:29.736 --> 14:32.170
can veto each other's
involvement at any time.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.440
No questions asked.
No turning back.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.409
Third,

14:38.445 --> 14:41.379
when we're with
other people,

14:41.414 --> 14:44.182
you'll be thinking of me

14:44.217 --> 14:46.384
and I'll be
thinking of you.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.050
- Grant and Lori.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.985
I am so glad
you could make it.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.654
This is our host,
Victoria Pope.

15:22.789 --> 15:24.422
- Rachel's been raving
about you guys.

15:24.457 --> 15:25.890
Welcome to my home.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.458
First things first.

15:27.494 --> 15:28.927
- Oh.

15:30.964 --> 15:32.497
- Everyone is so excited
to meet you.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.532
Let me show you around.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.835
I think you'll see we're kind of
like an extended family here.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.270
This is my husband,
Roger Pope.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.705
He's a real estate
developer

15:40.807 --> 15:42.573
working on revamping
the river walk.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.142
Darling.
- Yes?

15:44.177 --> 15:46.210
- Lori and Grant,
our new members.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.179
- Ah. Welcome to our home.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.547
- Thank you for having us.

15:49.649 --> 15:50.949
- It's so nice
to see new faces.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.283
- The place is amazing.

15:52.319 --> 15:53.985
Wait till you see
the rest of it.

15:54.020 --> 15:56.454
- Oh, my gosh, the river walk.
What a great project.

15:56.489 --> 15:57.722
Congratulations.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.057
- Well, thank you
so much.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.125
It's been a long,
long process.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.540
- Welcome, everyone.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.408
Welcome.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.344
We all know these articles.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.813
The rules we've sworn
to uphold.

16:21.848 --> 16:24.248
That we will be open
with one another.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.584
That we will not withhold.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.653
There is no shame.

16:28.688 --> 16:31.222
Only our secrets...

16:31.324 --> 16:33.992
in our circle of trust.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.434
Mario Ramis.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.503
Perfect match.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.008
Lori?

16:53.146 --> 16:54.545
Close your eyes.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.417
Noah Cranor.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.824
Splendid.

17:11.097 --> 17:12.696
Carmen.

17:18.671 --> 17:19.871
Roger.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.775
- Love you.
- Have fun, darling.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.410
- How are you?

17:26.579 --> 17:28.679
- Giselle.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.381
- Hmm.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.019
- Grant Malick.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.821
- Hi, I'm Giselle.

17:36.856 --> 17:38.389
- Hi.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.817
- I'm nervous.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.320
- Don't be.

18:11.124 --> 18:12.590
We can wait.

18:39.319 --> 18:44.722
<i>♪ ♪</i>

19:36.376 --> 19:38.409
She wears too much perfume.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.810
- Who?

19:39.846 --> 19:42.013
- Giselle.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.481
I can smell it on you.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.982
- I'm sorry.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.951
Did you think of me?

19:47.053 --> 19:48.352
- Yes.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.856
Did you think of me?

19:51.891 --> 19:54.158
- Oh, yeah.

20:18.251 --> 20:25.356
<i>♪ ♪</i>

20:39.205 --> 20:40.938
Good morning, honey.

20:40.974 --> 20:42.406
- Good morning.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.644
Is that good news?

20:46.746 --> 20:48.012
- Potentially.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.580
Rachel's client texted me,

20:49.616 --> 20:51.182
and she wants to meet
this morning

20:51.284 --> 20:53.317
about ideas for her house.

20:53.453 --> 20:56.220
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah.

21:03.429 --> 21:05.029
- It looks like I have
to go out of town

21:05.064 --> 21:07.932
to San Diego for a deposition
later on this week.

21:07.967 --> 21:10.901
Then afterwards I have to meet
some new clients for dinner.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.938
So I think I'm going to have
to stay the night.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.306
- Oh, honey,
you know how much

21:15.341 --> 21:17.241
I hate staying home
alone at night.

21:17.277 --> 21:18.976
Especially in a big house
like this.

21:19.012 --> 21:20.945
- It is big,
but it's also safe.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.047
There is no crime
for miles around.

21:23.149 --> 21:24.415
Welcome to suburbia.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.850
Get used to it.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.564
Good luck today.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.133
- Thank you.
- I know you'll get the job.

21:42.168 --> 21:44.101
- Thank you.
- Good morning, neighbors.

21:44.137 --> 21:45.436
- Hey, Noah.

21:45.471 --> 21:47.371
- Hey.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.840
Sorry we didn't get a chance
to talk more last night, buddy.

21:49.876 --> 21:52.276
- Oh, uh, yeah.
Me too.

21:52.312 --> 21:55.613
- Why don't you come over
to my house for dinner tonight.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.549
- Tonight?
- Uh-huh.

21:58.685 --> 22:01.285
- Oh, tonight. Don't we have
that... that thing?

22:01.321 --> 22:03.988
- No. No, we're free.
We're good.

22:04.023 --> 22:05.389
- Great. 6:30?

22:05.491 --> 22:06.724
- Yeah.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.793
Bring your appetite.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.828
- Have fun at work now, guys.

22:12.332 --> 22:15.099
- Babe, why did you
just agree to dinner?

22:15.201 --> 22:17.401
- Why not?
- Because it's awkward.

22:17.503 --> 22:20.104
- Babe, we can't hide from our
neighbors because it's awkward.

22:20.206 --> 22:23.474
This is what we signed up for
when we opened our marriage.

22:23.509 --> 22:27.645
Look, if we stand together
and we face our fears together,

22:27.680 --> 22:29.080
we will grow together.

22:30.883 --> 22:32.249
Let me know
how today goes.

22:32.352 --> 22:33.584
Okay?

22:39.025 --> 22:42.226
- So, how's the steak?

22:42.261 --> 22:43.527
Is it overcooked?

22:43.563 --> 22:44.929
- No, it was so good.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.497
Right, honey?
- So good. Great.

22:46.532 --> 22:49.734
- Oh, good, I'm glad
I just didn't ruin them.

22:52.939 --> 22:56.040
- So, how long have you guys
lived in the neighborhood?

22:56.075 --> 22:58.175
- Five years,
more or less.

22:58.211 --> 23:00.678
We love it up here.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.947
- When did you guys...

23:03.049 --> 23:04.582
I don't know...

23:04.617 --> 23:06.617
join the group?

23:06.719 --> 23:07.985
Is it okay to ask that?

23:08.087 --> 23:09.553
- Sure.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.589
There's nothing to hide here.

23:11.624 --> 23:14.125
It was a couple
of years ago.

23:14.227 --> 23:17.228
Um, Victoria asked me
to do some work on her house,

23:17.263 --> 23:20.064
and one thing
led to another.

23:20.099 --> 23:21.732
Here we are.

23:24.470 --> 23:26.704
Hey, you're an interior
designer.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.005
- Yes.

23:28.107 --> 23:29.306
- Can I show you something?

23:31.778 --> 23:33.010
- Sure, yeah.

23:33.112 --> 23:35.246
- The coffee table.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.516
Come here.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.684
- All right.

23:40.787 --> 23:42.753
- So you can be
completely honest.

23:42.789 --> 23:45.122
- Okay.

23:45.158 --> 23:46.524
- Is it ugly?

23:46.626 --> 23:48.325
- Oh, my gosh,
you made this?

23:48.428 --> 23:50.194
- Yeah.
- I love it.

23:50.296 --> 23:53.330
I mean, it's very simple,
but it's masculine.

23:53.466 --> 23:54.932
- That's me, I guess.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.333
Simple and masculine.

23:56.469 --> 23:58.402
- I like it.

23:58.438 --> 24:01.405
I hear that you also
build decks, is that true?

24:01.441 --> 24:03.240
- Word gets around.

24:03.276 --> 24:06.544
- Well, we were thinking about
adding a deck to our backyard.

24:06.646 --> 24:08.345
- I can come take a look.
- Really?

24:08.448 --> 24:10.181
- Of course.
- Oh, that's great.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.689
- I'm sorry about tonight.

24:21.327 --> 24:22.626
- It wasn't that bad.

24:22.662 --> 24:24.595
- He couldn't take his eyes
off of you.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.897
- Really?
- You didn't notice?

24:26.999 --> 24:28.732
- Were you jealous?

24:28.835 --> 24:31.035
- I mean, yeah,
a little.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.603
Maybe.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.939
- You're kind of cute
when you're jealous.

24:38.845 --> 24:41.378
Just so you know,
you have nothing to worry about.

24:41.481 --> 24:42.947
- Yeah.

24:42.982 --> 24:46.150
I think we should stay away
from Noah for a while.

24:46.185 --> 24:48.953
And he's definitely
off the approved list.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.755
Right?

24:51.791 --> 24:54.291
- Yeah. Right.

24:59.332 --> 25:01.499
Who is it?

25:01.534 --> 25:04.668
It's Rachel's client,
Miss Kupur.

25:04.704 --> 25:07.171
She wants to work with me.
She's giving me the job.

25:07.206 --> 25:08.672
- Congratulations.
That's great.

25:08.708 --> 25:09.974
- Such a relief.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.243
- Oh, my gosh.
I'm so happy for you.

25:12.378 --> 25:14.912
Mm, I'm so proud of you.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.947
Everything's falling
into place.

25:22.722 --> 25:24.989
What do you think
of Noah and Olivia?

25:25.024 --> 25:26.524
- They're an interesting couple.

25:26.559 --> 25:29.260
She never says much,
and he never shuts up.

25:29.395 --> 25:31.028
- I think he likes Lori.

25:31.063 --> 25:32.363
- Noah flirts
with all the wives.

25:32.398 --> 25:33.697
It's his thing.

25:33.733 --> 25:35.533
I don't know how Olivia
puts up with him.

25:35.568 --> 25:37.535
- Yeah, well, you never know
what goes on in a relationship.

25:37.570 --> 25:40.938
- Speaking of, Rachel told me
that Giselle mentioned

25:41.040 --> 25:43.007
you're helping her out
with some legal work?

25:43.042 --> 25:45.342
- No, no, I'm just giving her
some legal advice.

25:45.378 --> 25:48.178
- Okay, well,
here's my advice.

25:48.214 --> 25:50.648
Giselle can be trouble.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.216
All right, she's...

25:52.251 --> 25:54.285
she's a lot of fun,

25:54.387 --> 25:56.554
but she's miserable
in her marriage.

25:56.589 --> 26:00.491
Sometimes she can't separate
what happens at the parties

26:00.593 --> 26:01.992
from her real life.

26:02.094 --> 26:04.061
- Okay. Point taken.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.534
- Well, have a great day
at work.

26:10.570 --> 26:12.036
- I like the way
that sounds.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.671
Yeah, me too.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.406
- I'll call you later.
- Okay. Bye.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.296
- Oh, my God.

26:44.337 --> 26:45.636
- Car trouble?

26:45.671 --> 26:47.538
- Yeah, I guess.

26:47.640 --> 26:50.074
I mean, it was working fine
yesterday.

26:50.109 --> 26:52.042
- Want me to take a look?
- No, no, no.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.445
You really don't have
to do that.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.981
- It's my pleasure.
Pop the hood.

26:57.016 --> 26:58.616
- Um... how do I do that?

26:59.952 --> 27:01.251
I got you.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.778
Alternator seems okay.

27:30.716 --> 27:33.117
Maybe loose wire.

27:34.553 --> 27:35.886
Let's try that.

27:45.865 --> 27:47.531
Magic.

27:47.566 --> 27:50.868
- Oh, my gosh,
thank you so much.

27:50.903 --> 27:52.136
- No problem.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.570
But, uh...

27:55.675 --> 27:57.474
- Oh, my gosh.

27:57.510 --> 28:00.010
Whoopee.

28:00.046 --> 28:01.779
Look, I got to...

28:01.814 --> 28:03.047
so you got to...

28:03.082 --> 28:04.848
can I get my things...?

28:04.884 --> 28:07.584
- Oh, of course.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.426
- Thanks again.

28:33.112 --> 28:35.112
Noah.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.548
Oh, my God,
you scared me.

28:37.583 --> 28:39.550
Wait, how did...

28:39.585 --> 28:41.919
how did you get in here?

28:42.855 --> 28:44.421
- Door was open.

28:44.457 --> 28:47.124
- What are you doing here?

28:47.226 --> 28:49.293
- I thought you wanted this.

28:49.428 --> 28:50.861
- Wanted what?

28:57.269 --> 28:59.369
Stop. This isn't right.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.105
- What's the matter?

29:01.140 --> 29:02.906
- I'm married.

29:02.942 --> 29:05.042
- Yeah, you were married
the other night too.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.310
- That was different.

29:06.412 --> 29:07.878
- No, it wasn't.

29:07.913 --> 29:10.380
We had a connection.

29:10.416 --> 29:14.184
You felt it then,
and you feel it now.

29:14.286 --> 29:16.386
You don't have
to pretend with me.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.255
I'm all yours.
- Stop. I'll scream.

29:18.290 --> 29:19.823
I'll call the police.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.594
- Now, what was all that
at dinner the other night, huh?

29:23.629 --> 29:26.663
- I was admiring
your furniture.

29:45.451 --> 29:46.583
Olivia.

29:46.619 --> 29:47.918
- Sorry to bother you, Lori.

29:47.953 --> 29:49.386
Have you seen Noah
this morning?

29:49.488 --> 29:50.954
- I...

29:50.990 --> 29:54.124
I saw him a few minutes ago
in your garage.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.960
- Well, he's gone.
I can't find him.

29:56.996 --> 29:59.096
Did he come over here
by any chance?

29:59.131 --> 30:01.465
- No. Why would he come here?

30:01.500 --> 30:03.667
- Just thought I'd check.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.913
- Well, I, um...

30:16.015 --> 30:17.481
wish I could stay
and chat,

30:17.516 --> 30:19.716
but I'm running late
for work, so...

30:19.852 --> 30:22.252
- Won't keep you then.

30:22.354 --> 30:23.787
- Okay.

30:45.911 --> 30:47.344
Noah?

What are you doing

- Really good.

33:09.888 --> 33:11.655
- Me too.

33:11.757 --> 33:14.992
Derek and Rachel invited us
to another party.

33:19.098 --> 33:20.797
- I'm not comfortable
going back.

33:20.899 --> 33:22.399

33:22.434 --> 33:23.700
- Actually, no.

33:23.736 --> 33:25.035
And now that things

33:25.070 --> 33:27.504
are going good
between us,

33:27.606 --> 33:29.139
I mean, what's the purpose?

33:29.241 --> 33:31.908
- Well, I mean, we might be able
to take our relationship

33:31.944 --> 33:34.044
to an even deeper level.

33:34.079 --> 33:36.847
- Babe, we tried it once.
I say we just move on.

33:36.949 --> 33:40.017
Besides, I don't need those
people to get to a deeper level.

33:40.119 --> 33:44.421
- Well, it's just that
those people know us.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.490
I mean, what are they
going to say?

33:46.592 --> 33:50.861
- I'm sure that people
have left the circle before.

33:50.963 --> 33:54.965
Besides, you made
a commitment to me

33:55.000 --> 33:56.400
before we started this.

33:56.435 --> 33:58.935
We both did.

33:58.971 --> 34:00.537
If anyone wants to stop,
we stop.

34:01.940 --> 34:03.774
Lori, it's just...

34:03.809 --> 34:05.609
the other night,
I saw something in you

34:05.644 --> 34:08.110
that I thought was gone.

34:08.147 --> 34:12.114
I saw the woman
that I fell in love with.

34:12.150 --> 34:13.483
I know you felt it too.

34:13.518 --> 34:15.619
I just don't want
to lose you again.

34:15.654 --> 34:17.487
And you won't lose me.

34:17.523 --> 34:19.790
Things are on a roll now.

34:19.824 --> 34:22.626
We just have to remember
to check in with each other.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.129
Okay.

34:49.688 --> 34:52.289
- This would be perfect
across from the fireplace.

34:52.324 --> 34:54.024
- It's nice, right?

34:54.059 --> 34:55.958
And I think this one would pair
really well with it.

34:55.994 --> 34:57.828
It's the same designer.

34:57.863 --> 35:00.197
- I don't know.
It feels too dated.

35:00.232 --> 35:02.132
- That's fair. There's another
one I wanted you to see.

35:02.167 --> 35:03.667
It's right...

35:09.508 --> 35:11.341
- Oh, that one looks nice.

35:15.547 --> 35:17.247
- Are you serious?

35:17.349 --> 35:19.116
What are you
doing here?

35:19.218 --> 35:22.252
- I wanted to get some fresh
ideas for a chair I'm building.

35:22.354 --> 35:24.154
- I am working.

35:24.189 --> 35:26.790
Okay? You need to leave.

35:26.892 --> 35:28.792
- I got you something.

35:32.531 --> 35:35.532
It's an apology for the way
I acted earlier.

35:36.768 --> 35:38.668
- Noah, I don't want
anything from you.

35:38.704 --> 35:40.303
- Open it, please.

35:46.245 --> 35:47.677
- It's handcuffs.

35:47.713 --> 35:49.246
I made them myself.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.315
- Is this some kind of joke?

35:52.417 --> 35:54.451
- Oh, that depends
how we use them.

35:54.553 --> 35:57.254
- Wow, you have no filter,
do you?

35:57.289 --> 36:00.056
Noah, everything isn't
about you, okay?

36:00.092 --> 36:01.858
- And what about
the other day?

36:01.894 --> 36:03.660
You let me kiss you.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.829
I think that was
about you.

36:05.931 --> 36:07.631
And I know
you enjoyed it.

36:07.733 --> 36:09.132
- I told you that
that was wrong.

36:09.234 --> 36:10.867
- It didn't feel wrong.

36:12.437 --> 36:14.571
- Look, you need to go.

36:16.241 --> 36:17.607
- Lori?

36:17.643 --> 36:19.409
I didn't know.
I'm sorry.

36:19.444 --> 36:21.645
- Oh, no, Miss Kupur.
This is--

36:21.747 --> 36:23.547
- Noah.
- Hello, Noah.

36:23.582 --> 36:26.216
- I'm Lori's neighbor.
We just ran into each other.

36:26.251 --> 36:27.984
- Mm-hmm.

36:28.086 --> 36:31.588
- Actually, my wife and I
are big fans of her work.

36:31.623 --> 36:33.924
She's offered to help us
with our bedroom.

36:33.959 --> 36:36.760
We're opening it up,
adding some new things.

36:36.795 --> 36:38.662
- That sounds nice.

36:38.764 --> 36:40.964
Pleased to meet you.
I wanted to ask you

36:40.999 --> 36:42.566
what you thought about
that table over there.

36:42.601 --> 36:43.967
- Okay, I'll be right there,
Miss Kupur.

36:45.604 --> 36:47.904
If you don't leave
right now,

36:47.940 --> 36:49.406
I'm going to call
the police.

36:49.441 --> 36:51.408
- And what are you
going to tell them?

36:51.443 --> 36:54.477
You ran into your friendly
neighbor at the furniture store?

37:10.529 --> 37:12.929
- I think we have done it.

37:12.965 --> 37:14.497
You managed to put together the
perfect set.

37:14.533 --> 37:15.966
- Everything is going
to look really great.

37:16.001 --> 37:17.434
Next we'll talk flooring, okay?

37:17.469 --> 37:19.569
We have a lot to do.

37:19.671 --> 37:20.937
- Yes.

37:39.324 --> 37:40.790
Hello?

37:40.826 --> 37:42.225
<i>- Did you like our video?</i>

37:42.327 --> 37:45.262
- Noah, you need
to leave me alone.

37:45.364 --> 37:47.297
- Thanks again, Lori.
Have a good day.

37:47.332 --> 37:49.366
- Thanks, you too.
Bye-bye, Miss Kupur.

37:52.170 --> 37:55.171
<i>- Meet me at the
Villa Serena Inn, Room 201.</i>

37:55.207 --> 37:59.209
One hour, or that video goes
out to all of your clients.

38:01.213 --> 38:03.046
- How? You don't even have
my client list.

38:03.081 --> 38:04.614
- When I was in your house
earlier,

38:04.716 --> 38:05.882
I forwarded your laptop
address book

38:05.917 --> 38:07.684
to my account.

38:07.719 --> 38:09.452
How's your mom in Ohio doing?

38:12.891 --> 38:14.391
If you don't show up,

38:14.426 --> 38:16.993
that video goes to everyone
on your list.

38:17.029 --> 38:18.962
Everyone.

38:19.064 --> 38:20.864
And I'll tell Grant how you
invited me out for a drink

38:20.899 --> 38:22.866
after I helped
fix your car.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.200
- You're sick.

38:24.236 --> 38:25.935
- Make your decision.

38:26.038 --> 38:29.406
The clock is ticking,
and I'm losing my patience.

38:33.078 --> 38:34.411
- Okay.

38:38.750 --> 38:39.949
Come on, Grant.

38:40.052 --> 38:41.918
Pick up, pick up.
Please pick up.

38:43.388 --> 38:45.522
<i>- This is Grant Malick...</i>
- Damn it.

39:06.978 --> 39:08.578
- You're early.

39:19.491 --> 39:22.092
- Sorry about before.

39:22.127 --> 39:24.127
I was just so stressed.

39:25.797 --> 39:28.298
You know you don't have
to work so hard to get me.

39:28.333 --> 39:30.834
- I knew you'd come around.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.402
- Ah.

39:32.537 --> 39:35.238
Before we get too far
ahead of ourselves...

39:58.363 --> 40:00.897
- What about the video?

40:02.901 --> 40:05.068
- I'm not worried
about the video.

40:06.171 --> 40:11.074
I am more concerned
with these.

40:11.176 --> 40:13.309
- Now that's more like it.

40:13.412 --> 40:15.478
- You know what turns me on?

40:15.514 --> 40:16.713
- Mm-hmm.

40:16.748 --> 40:20.016
- A man who can be
vulnerable.

40:22.721 --> 40:25.922
Are you strong enough
to be vulnerable with me?

40:27.926 --> 40:29.125
Lie back.

40:49.448 --> 40:51.815
- Oh!

40:51.950 --> 40:53.349
- You think you can
blackmail me?

40:53.452 --> 40:54.851
Ruin my career?

40:58.056 --> 40:59.923
What's wrong with you?

40:59.958 --> 41:01.558
- What's the passcode?

41:01.593 --> 41:03.326
- I don't know.

41:12.237 --> 41:13.436
- I deleted it.

41:13.472 --> 41:14.838
Are there any more copies?

41:14.906 --> 41:17.407
- No.
- How do I know?

41:17.442 --> 41:20.243
- I guess we're just going
to have to trust each other.

41:25.450 --> 41:27.383
What, are you just going
to leave me here?

41:29.921 --> 41:31.554
Come on, this is silly.

41:33.258 --> 41:35.258
Come on, this is crazy.

41:36.261 --> 41:37.427
Damn it!

41:37.462 --> 41:39.062
Untie me.

41:42.167 --> 41:45.401
- If you ever pull anything
like this ever again,

41:45.437 --> 41:48.404
I'm going to post this photo
on the Neighborhood Watch site

41:48.440 --> 41:49.772
for everyone to see.

41:49.808 --> 41:51.374
Do you understand?

41:51.510 --> 41:53.543
Stay away from me.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.962
- Lori, are you okay?

42:12.998 --> 42:14.931
- No.
- What happened?

42:14.966 --> 42:17.166
- Where were you today?
- I was at work.

42:17.202 --> 42:18.601
- Well, why didn't you
answer your phone?

42:18.637 --> 42:20.236
Why didn't you have it
turned on?

42:20.305 --> 42:22.171
Every time I called you,
it went straight to voicemail.

42:22.207 --> 42:23.439
- I am so sorry.

42:23.542 --> 42:25.308
I was in and out
of meetings all day.

42:25.343 --> 42:27.610
And you know that room gets
terrible cell phone reception.

42:27.646 --> 42:28.912
What happened?

42:29.047 --> 42:30.647
Is it the job?
What happened?

42:30.682 --> 42:32.749
- I thought I could
take care of it myself.

42:32.884 --> 42:34.150
- What are you
talking about?

42:34.185 --> 42:36.653
- Babe, it's Noah.

42:36.688 --> 42:38.121
- Noah?

42:38.223 --> 42:39.956
- You saw how he was
at dinner the other night.

42:39.991 --> 42:42.258
Well, it's gotten worse.

42:42.394 --> 42:43.660
He won't leave me alone.

42:43.695 --> 42:46.829
He's been showing up
here at the house.

42:46.865 --> 42:48.097
- Did he hurt you?

42:48.233 --> 42:49.899
- No, but...

42:50.001 --> 42:53.670
he followed me to the furniture
store today while I was working.

42:53.705 --> 42:55.505
He humiliated me.

42:55.540 --> 42:58.041
He tried to blackmail me.

42:58.076 --> 42:59.976
And he threatened me.

43:00.011 --> 43:01.678
- That son of a bitch!

43:01.713 --> 43:03.646
- Grant, wait. Grant...

43:04.749 --> 43:06.049
Grant, wait.

43:06.084 --> 43:08.351
Grant. Grant!

43:11.556 --> 43:12.922
- You want to harass someone?
Try me.

43:13.024 --> 43:14.524
Let's see how far you get.

43:14.559 --> 43:16.159
- Bad day at work, Grant?
- No, it's you.

43:16.194 --> 43:18.094
You're stalking my wife.
Are you insane?

43:18.196 --> 43:20.630
- Now, what exactly
am I accused of doing?

43:20.699 --> 43:24.500
- Noah, you followed me to the
store today, and you know it.

43:24.536 --> 43:26.970
- Are you sure you told him
the whole story?

43:27.038 --> 43:28.204
You really want
to get into this?

43:28.239 --> 43:29.906
- No, you are out of line.

43:29.941 --> 43:31.574
- Lori, your Boy Scout here

43:31.610 --> 43:33.476
is obviously
the jealous type.

43:33.612 --> 43:35.411
Maybe you guys should rethink
the whole circle thing.

43:35.447 --> 43:38.214
It's not for everybody.
- Stay away from Lori.

43:38.249 --> 43:41.951
- Grant, I thought
we were friends.

43:43.888 --> 43:45.221
- Come on,
let's just go.

43:45.256 --> 43:47.023
- You should listen
to your wife.

43:47.058 --> 43:50.326
- If you go near my wife again,
I will kill you.

43:50.395 --> 43:52.629
Do you understand that?

43:54.566 --> 43:55.999
- Grant, please, come on.

44:06.144 --> 44:07.477
- What?

44:11.583 --> 44:13.449
- Look, I can cancel
my work trip

44:13.485 --> 44:14.751
if you're worried about him.

44:14.786 --> 44:16.386
- No.

44:16.421 --> 44:18.621
I really don't want you
to have to do that.

44:18.657 --> 44:20.590
- Are you sure?

44:20.625 --> 44:22.058
- Yeah.

44:22.093 --> 44:23.526
I called Kat,

44:23.662 --> 44:26.029
and she's going to come
stay with me.

44:26.164 --> 44:27.964
- That's great.
Makes me feel a lot better.

44:27.999 --> 44:31.300
Um, look, everyone knows about
Noah now in the neighborhood,

44:31.336 --> 44:33.970
so he would be absolutely stupid
to try anything else.

44:34.005 --> 44:36.105

charger is?

51:51.142 --> 51:53.008
Okay? Are you going

51:54.345 --> 51:55.744

51:55.847 --> 51:57.313
- Okay.

52:03.855 --> 52:06.355
Oh, uh, I did call
the alarm company,

52:06.390 --> 52:08.124

52:08.159 --> 52:10.059

53:00.611 --> 53:02.178

53:02.213 --> 53:04.046
- What do you mean,
missing?

53:04.081 --> 53:05.347
- He didn't come home
last night.

53:05.383 --> 53:06.815
That's not like him.

53:06.918 --> 53:08.384
And I found his wallet
and his keys,

53:08.419 --> 53:10.886
and his phone
in the house.

53:10.922 --> 53:12.555
I'm worried that something
happened to him.

53:12.590 --> 53:14.190
- Okay, when is the last time
that you saw him?

53:14.225 --> 53:16.158
- Yesterday morning.
I left, and when I came back,

53:16.260 --> 53:17.626
he was gone.

53:17.728 --> 53:20.196
Did you happen to see him
at all yesterday?

53:20.231 --> 53:22.131
- No. Why would I
have seen him?

53:22.233 --> 53:24.800
- I don't know.
I'm asking everyone.

53:24.902 --> 53:28.170
I have to go call the police.
File a missing persons report.

53:28.272 --> 53:29.805
I'm sorry I bothered you.

53:29.907 --> 53:32.074
I'll call Rachel.
Maybe she saw something.

53:52.897 --> 53:54.630
- It's definitely not mine.

53:54.665 --> 53:56.932
I hate charms,
you know that.

53:57.068 --> 54:00.536
Maybe it belonged to the people
that used to live there before.

54:00.571 --> 54:02.805
- No, it wasn't there
when we moved in.

54:02.907 --> 54:04.807
- And you said a kitchen knife
is missing.

54:04.842 --> 54:07.543
- Yeah.
- So, what are you thinking?

54:07.578 --> 54:10.312
That Noah was stabbed
and that Grant did it?

54:10.414 --> 54:11.880
And he had an accomplice?

54:11.916 --> 54:15.951
- Well, I smelled cheap perfume
on Grant's shirt,

54:16.087 --> 54:17.987
and it was the same kind
of cheap perfume

54:18.022 --> 54:21.156
that I smelled on Giselle
a few days ago.

54:21.192 --> 54:23.192
- Wait, the woman he...

54:23.227 --> 54:24.994
You think they did it
together?

54:25.029 --> 54:27.196
- I don't know.

54:27.231 --> 54:29.832
Hell, I don't even know
if Noah's really dead.

54:29.934 --> 54:32.334
All I know is that something
horrible happened to me

54:32.370 --> 54:34.403
and to him last night.

54:34.438 --> 54:36.739
- So why not go to the police?

54:36.774 --> 54:38.340
- What am I supposed to say?

54:38.376 --> 54:40.175
That I think my husband
killed him,

54:40.278 --> 54:42.011
and that he had help
from a woman

54:42.113 --> 54:43.646
who likes to wear
charm bracelets

54:43.714 --> 54:45.381
and wear cheap perfume?

54:45.416 --> 54:46.649
- Yeah.

this happened.</i>

56:07.698 --> 56:10.632

56:12.837 --> 56:15.304

worn different shoes.

- A jogger over there found the
body around 8:00 this morning.

56:23.547 --> 56:25.447
Victim's a white male,
approximately 40 years old,

56:25.549 --> 56:27.816
with multiple stab wounds
to the abdomen.

56:27.852 --> 56:30.252
From the looks of it,
it was a pretty vicious attack.

56:30.321 --> 56:32.087
- You think he was killed
up here?

56:32.223 --> 56:35.324
- No. Found drag marks
off the trail, with footprints.

56:35.359 --> 56:37.159
The body was definitely dumped.

56:37.194 --> 56:40.662
The coroner puts the time
of death around midnight.

56:40.698 --> 56:41.897
- Don't people move up here

56:41.999 --> 56:43.766
to get away from
this kind of thing?

56:52.543 --> 56:54.343
- Yes?

56:54.378 --> 56:55.611
- Olivia Cranor?

56:55.679 --> 56:56.979
- Yes.

56:57.014 --> 56:58.280
- I'm Detective Sato.

56:58.416 --> 57:00.115
This is my partner,
Detective Kurland,

57:00.251 --> 57:01.450
with the Homicide Division.

57:01.585 --> 57:03.051
- What's this about?

57:03.087 --> 57:05.287
- We have some news
about your husband.

57:05.423 --> 57:06.855
May we come inside?

57:06.891 --> 57:08.490
- Yes, of course.

57:31.282 --> 57:32.815
- What are you doing?

57:34.118 --> 57:36.518
I was just about
to do some laundry.

57:36.554 --> 57:38.720
What are you doing home
so early?

57:38.756 --> 57:41.323
- I just got a call from Derek.
He said Noah was missing.

57:41.459 --> 57:42.691
So I came to see
if you were okay.

57:42.793 --> 57:45.093
- Yeah. I'm okay.

57:45.129 --> 57:47.429
But I have a question
for you.

57:47.465 --> 57:49.531
Why does your shirt
from last night

57:49.567 --> 57:52.134
reek of Giselle's perfume?

57:53.771 --> 57:56.004
- I ran into her at a gas
station on the way to town.

57:56.140 --> 57:57.873
She gave me a hug hello.

57:57.908 --> 57:59.908
You know how much perfume
she wears.

57:59.944 --> 58:01.677
- Right. How convenient.

58:01.812 --> 58:04.079
And somehow you forgot
to tell me

58:04.114 --> 58:06.315
that you're helping her
with that lawsuit.

58:08.752 --> 58:10.419
Was she a part of your
business trip too?

58:10.454 --> 58:12.221
And what is this?

58:13.791 --> 58:15.958
- What? Why are you
checking up on me?

58:15.993 --> 58:17.759
What is this all about?

58:29.173 --> 58:31.240
Who is it?

58:34.945 --> 58:36.778
- Good afternoon,
Mr. and Mrs. Malick.

58:36.814 --> 58:39.214
I'm Detective Sato. This is
my partner, Detective Kurland,

58:39.350 --> 58:40.582
with the Homicide Division.

58:40.684 --> 58:41.950
We'd like to ask you
some questions

58:41.986 --> 58:43.619
about your neighbor,
Noah Cranor.

58:43.654 --> 58:46.922
- Sure, come on in,
detectives.

58:47.024 --> 58:48.557
Please.

58:50.294 --> 58:51.560
- A jogger found
Mr. Cranor's body

58:51.629 --> 58:53.228
up on the ridge
this morning.

58:53.364 --> 58:55.297
He had been stabbed to death
sometime last night.

58:56.333 --> 58:58.100
- That's horrible.

58:58.202 --> 58:59.434
- His wife, Olivia Cranor,

58:59.537 --> 59:01.003
mentioned that you
and Mr. Cranor

59:01.038 --> 59:02.471
had a heated argument
two nights ago

59:02.506 --> 59:04.172
where you threatened
to kill him?

59:04.208 --> 59:05.774
- Look...

59:05.809 --> 59:08.343
yes, Noah and I
did have an argument,

59:08.379 --> 59:12.347
and unfortunately things
were said on both sides.

59:12.383 --> 59:13.982
But that's all.

59:14.018 --> 59:15.651
I mean, it was forgotten about
right afterwards.

59:15.686 --> 59:17.786
- Yes, it's also unfortunate
that two days later,

59:17.821 --> 59:19.421
he's found dead
in the nearby mountains.

59:19.557 --> 59:22.925
- My husband only went there
to confront Noah,

59:23.060 --> 59:24.593
because he was stalking me.

59:24.662 --> 59:26.328
Did Olivia tell you that?

59:26.363 --> 59:28.931
- Did you ever file a police
report about this stalking?

59:29.066 --> 59:30.265
- I didn't.

59:30.401 --> 59:31.833
- And did this
stalking take place

59:31.869 --> 59:34.269
before or after
the circle of trust party?

59:36.574 --> 59:37.940
- After.

59:38.075 --> 59:39.808
- And how long had you
been a part of this group?

59:39.910 --> 59:41.510
- It was our first
and last time.

59:41.545 --> 59:43.278
- Mrs. Malick,
did you continue

59:43.414 --> 59:45.347
to see Noah Cranor
after that one night together?

59:47.518 --> 59:50.619
- Look, Noah followed her
into a store

59:50.754 --> 59:52.120
when she was with
one of her clients,

59:52.256 --> 59:53.522
if that's what you mean.

59:53.557 --> 59:55.757
- And where were you
last night, Mr. Malick?

59:55.859 --> 59:57.626
- I was in San Diego for work,
and I came back early

59:57.761 --> 59:58.994
because Lori was ill.

59:59.029 --> 01:00:01.029
- So you were home all night.

01:00:01.065 --> 01:00:02.497
- Yes.

01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:09.504
- Look, is there anything else
we can do for you gentlemen?

01:00:09.607 --> 01:00:11.273
We have to get ready
for a dinner.

01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:13.041
- We're probably going to need
you both to come down

01:00:13.077 --> 01:00:14.409
for a more thorough interview
tomorrow.

01:00:14.445 --> 01:00:15.911
- Okay. That's fine.

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:18.847
Please just contact our attorney
from now on.

01:00:18.882 --> 01:00:20.716
We'll be turning this matter
over to him.

01:00:20.751 --> 01:00:24.953
- That's a nasty cut you got
there. Where did you get that?

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:28.457
- His name is Derek Adams.

01:00:30.928 --> 01:00:32.327
Thank you very much, gentlemen,

01:00:32.463 --> 01:00:33.862
and best of luck
on the investigation.

01:00:33.897 --> 01:00:35.931
Let us know if we can help you
in any other way.

01:00:38.068 --> 01:00:39.501
- Oh, my God,
did you kill him?

01:00:39.637 --> 01:00:41.536
- Lori--
- No, don't come close to me.

01:00:41.572 --> 01:00:43.872
- Look, you're being ridiculous.
Of course I didn't kill him.

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:46.208
Look, you cannot talk
to anyone about this

01:00:46.243 --> 01:00:47.976
without Derek present.

01:00:48.078 --> 01:00:50.579
The police can use
whatever we say against us.

01:00:50.614 --> 01:00:52.681
- What do you mean "us"?

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:55.117
Who are you calling?
- Derek.

01:00:55.152 --> 01:00:58.086
Look, the police obviously
think we're suspects.

01:00:58.122 --> 01:00:59.721
Okay?
- Oh, my God.

01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:01.089
- I don't know
what Olivia told them,

01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:02.724
but I guarantee
they're going to come back

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.326
and search the house
for evidence.

01:01:05.462 --> 01:01:07.396
Derek. Hey, it's Grant.

01:01:07.431 --> 01:01:08.630
Look, I need your help.

01:01:08.666 --> 01:01:09.898
Two detectives showed up.

01:01:09.933 --> 01:01:11.400
No, no, no,
they just left...

01:01:43.901 --> 01:01:45.267
- What are you doing?

01:01:45.402 --> 01:01:46.935
- You can have
the bed tonight.

01:01:47.071 --> 01:01:48.770
I'll sleep downstairs.

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:54.309
- You were with Giselle,
weren't you?

01:01:58.749 --> 01:02:01.216
Grant, we should never
have gone to that party.

01:02:02.519 --> 01:02:03.852
That night destroyed
everything

01:02:03.887 --> 01:02:06.421
that we have ever
built together.

01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:21.703
Search warrant.

01:02:21.739 --> 01:02:23.171
Police department.
Open up.

01:02:23.273 --> 01:02:25.173
- Grant, wake up.

01:02:25.209 --> 01:02:27.676
What's going on?
- Step aside.

01:02:27.778 --> 01:02:29.244
- Grant, what is happening?

01:02:29.279 --> 01:02:30.979
- We've got a search warrant
signed by a judge.

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:33.749
I think you'll find everything
in order, counselor.

01:02:35.452 --> 01:02:37.519
- Can they do this?

01:02:37.554 --> 01:02:39.321
- Yes, they can.

01:02:39.423 --> 01:02:40.889
- I need you both
to stay in the living room

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:42.357
while I execute
this warrant.

01:02:42.392 --> 01:02:43.992
Thank you for
your cooperation.

01:02:45.596 --> 01:02:47.629
- They're taking my car
as evidence.

01:02:50.734 --> 01:02:52.667
Yeah, Derek, it's Grant.

01:02:52.803 --> 01:02:56.138
They're here with a search
warrant and a team of deputies.

01:02:56.173 --> 01:02:58.173
Okay. Thanks.

01:03:23.634 --> 01:03:25.233
What are you doing?

01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:27.302
- I'm going to stay
with Kat for a while.

01:03:27.337 --> 01:03:29.638
- Honey, I really don't think
that's a good idea

01:03:29.673 --> 01:03:31.907
until we know
what's going on.

01:03:31.942 --> 01:03:33.942
- I know what's going on.

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:35.544
- No, you don't.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.780
- Grant, stop it.

01:03:42.019 --> 01:03:43.952
- I don't trust you.

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:46.855
And I just don't feel safe
in this house anymore.

01:03:49.893 --> 01:03:51.560
- Honey, I need to borrow
your car in the morning

01:03:51.662 --> 01:03:53.161
to go to work.

01:03:53.197 --> 01:03:54.663
What am I going to do?

01:03:54.698 --> 01:03:56.932
- I don't know.
Call a cab.

01:03:56.967 --> 01:03:58.300
Or call Giselle.

01:03:58.335 --> 01:03:59.901
Excuse me.

01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:08.176
- Yeah, let's move
the deposition

01:04:08.212 --> 01:04:09.711
to later on next week,
and then contact her

01:04:09.746 --> 01:04:11.980
- and see how she feels--
- Grant Malick.

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:13.982
You're under arrest
for the murder of Noah Cranor.

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:15.817
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:04:15.853 --> 01:04:18.119
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

01:04:18.222 --> 01:04:19.521
- I know my rights.

01:04:19.556 --> 01:04:21.356
Call Derek, let him know
what's happening,

01:04:21.391 --> 01:04:22.724
and then call my wife.

01:04:40.711 --> 01:04:42.711
I am so sorry
for all of this.

01:04:43.914 --> 01:04:46.748
Can you ever forgive me?

01:04:49.853 --> 01:04:51.953
- Derek told me that they found
your footprints

01:04:52.089 --> 01:04:53.989
at the crime scene.

01:04:54.091 --> 01:04:56.992
And Noah's blood
in your car.

01:04:58.262 --> 01:05:00.161
What really happened
that night?

01:05:01.265 --> 01:05:02.731
The truth.

01:05:05.936 --> 01:05:08.036
After we got off the phone,
I drove home.

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:10.205
And when I got home,

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.340
I found Noah
dead on the rug.

01:05:13.443 --> 01:05:16.077
And I found you
lying on the couch.

01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:18.680
And next to you
on the coffee table,

01:05:18.715 --> 01:05:20.515
I found a bloody knife.

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:23.752
<i>So I dragged Noah's dead body
out to the back,</i>

01:05:23.787 --> 01:05:25.553
<i>put him in my trunk,</i>

01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:27.555
and drove up
to the canyon,

01:05:27.591 --> 01:05:29.591
and I dumped his body.

01:05:29.626 --> 01:05:32.027
That's where
I got the scratch.

01:05:34.631 --> 01:05:37.599
I did all of this
to protect you, Lori.

01:05:37.634 --> 01:05:39.935
- I didn't kill him.

01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:42.270
- I know.

01:05:45.108 --> 01:05:48.043
- Were you with Giselle
that night?

01:05:51.815 --> 01:05:53.248
- On my way down
to San Diego,

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:55.317
I stopped by her house
in the desert.

01:05:59.089 --> 01:06:00.689
I lied to you.

01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:02.357
I cheated on you.

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:05.560
And betrayed you.

01:06:07.164 --> 01:06:09.197
I'm so sorry, Lori.

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:12.634
I have no excuse.

01:06:13.804 --> 01:06:15.537
- So then who killed Noah?

01:06:17.174 --> 01:06:18.940
And who drugged me?

01:06:18.976 --> 01:06:23.078
- Giselle told me that her and
Noah had an affair last year.

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:25.947
She also told me that she
borrowed some money from him.

01:06:25.983 --> 01:06:29.117
And when she told him she
couldn't pay him back,

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:32.053
he started to harass her
and stalk her.

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:35.156
Does that sound familiar?

01:06:37.027 --> 01:06:39.594
- You think that Giselle
has something to do with this?

01:06:40.998 --> 01:06:42.397
- I don't know.

01:06:43.967 --> 01:06:45.266
Maybe.

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:56.745
Giselle.

01:06:58.382 --> 01:06:59.581
Derek already called me.

01:06:59.716 --> 01:07:00.949
I can't help you.
I'm sorry.

01:07:00.984 --> 01:07:02.417
- Look, I just want to know
where you were

01:07:02.552 --> 01:07:03.752
on the night
of Noah's murder.

01:07:06.757 --> 01:07:08.656
You think I was involved?

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:10.859
- Do you have an alibi?

01:07:10.894 --> 01:07:13.361
- I was with my husband.

01:07:13.397 --> 01:07:16.664
- Well, does he know you were
having an affair with mine?

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:17.932
Or Noah?

01:07:18.035 --> 01:07:19.300
Maybe you had
a reason to kill him.

01:07:19.336 --> 01:07:21.736
I heard he was stalking you,
just like me.

01:07:23.907 --> 01:07:25.673
- Really?

01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:28.943
Did you also hear about Olivia
going to Rachel last week

01:07:29.079 --> 01:07:30.779
asking for comps
on her house?

She's not exactly acting

Why don't you ask her where she
was the night of the murder.

01:07:42.192 --> 01:07:45.393
If anyone had a reason to kill
that son of a bitch, it was her.

01:08:15.125 --> 01:08:16.558
- Lori.

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:17.759

off my door and go.

was having an affair with Noah.

to Rachel.

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:03.138
The gossip queen.

01:09:03.173 --> 01:09:06.341
- Listen, I think that Giselle
killed Noah,

01:09:06.376 --> 01:09:10.645
because he was harassing her
about money that she owed him.

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.647

01:09:12.682 --> 01:09:14.149

You had to know
about the affair.

01:09:18.054 --> 01:09:20.955
- My private life
is my business.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:25.260
Giselle was having an affair
with my husband too.

01:09:25.395 --> 01:09:29.497
And she told him
a few important things,

01:09:29.533 --> 01:09:32.767
like how she was trying
to get Noah into a trap,

01:09:32.903 --> 01:09:35.170
so she could kill him.

01:09:35.205 --> 01:09:38.139
I guess the threats
and the harassment

01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:41.975
was getting to be
too much for her.

01:09:42.078 --> 01:09:44.345
- Then why did the police
have enough evidence

01:09:44.381 --> 01:09:46.180
to arrest your husband?

01:09:46.216 --> 01:09:49.216
- Because Giselle set him up.

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:53.287
- Excuse me.

01:09:53.423 --> 01:09:54.956

01:12:03.386 --> 01:12:05.019

for an hour to get here

01:12:05.055 --> 01:12:06.854

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:08.523

I need to get over there,

I can find that bracelet,

Call the police?
And tell them what?

01:12:19.903 --> 01:12:22.970

bracelet in a picture?
