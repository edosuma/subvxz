03:11.734 --> 03:13.109
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.403
Come on.

03:15.571 --> 03:17.864
- Yeah?
- <i>Where are you, Charlie?</i>

03:18.032 --> 03:20.283
<i>More importantly, where is my money?</i>

03:20.618 --> 03:21.659
- <i>You're into me for 30 grand.</i>
- All right, all right.

03:21.827 --> 03:23.703
Jack, Jack, Jack,
I'm going to pay you.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.705
<i>This ain't Jack! It's Bill Panner.</i>

03:25.873 --> 03:27.415
<i>You owe Jack money, too?</i>

03:27.583 --> 03:29.417
<i>Charlie, you pay me first!</i>

03:29.585 --> 03:31.711
Bill, hey, no, we're good, buddy.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.213
I got your money.
It's right here in my hand.

03:33.380 --> 03:38.051
So why don't we meet up on the...

03:41.013 --> 03:42.514
- <i>Charlie, your phone's going screwy.</i>
- Bill?

03:42.681 --> 03:43.890
- <i>Hello?</i>
- I'm losing you, Bill.

03:44.058 --> 03:46.643
<i>Wait, Charlie,</i>
<i>I can't hear what you're saying.</i>

03:48.979 --> 03:52.148
Hey, mister.
Is that Ambush?

03:52.316 --> 03:55.610
- Uh, yeah.
- Can we see him?

03:57.196 --> 03:59.239
- You want to see him?
- Yeah.

03:59.406 --> 04:03.159
All right, give me...
Give me a minute.

04:07.957 --> 04:10.458
This...

04:10.626 --> 04:13.419
...is Ambush. Wakey, wakey.

04:33.482 --> 04:36.526
- What robot is he fighting?
- Actually, he's going to fight...

04:36.694 --> 04:38.361
Whoa, little lady.
What are you doing?

04:38.529 --> 04:41.573
- Can we get a picture with him?
- Sure. For five dollars.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.867
You want five dollars? Seriously?

04:44.034 --> 04:46.536
No, I want five dollars immediately.

04:46.704 --> 04:48.246
Come on, guys.

04:48.414 --> 04:49.956
Hey, hey.

04:50.124 --> 04:51.541
All right, all right, I'm kidding.

04:51.709 --> 04:53.251
- Three bucks.
- Whatever.

04:53.419 --> 04:55.920
- How about $2.50?
- You suck!

04:57.173 --> 04:59.007
All right.

04:59.175 --> 05:02.552
It's going to be one
of those towns, huh?

05:02.720 --> 05:04.679
<i>Welcome,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>

05:04.847 --> 05:07.140
<i>to the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.</i>

05:07.308 --> 05:08.266
- Yah!
- <i>Please take your seats.</i>

05:08.434 --> 05:11.227
<i>We're almost ready</i>
<i>to get this thing started.</i>

05:13.397 --> 05:15.899
I was told my bot
was fighting an 800-pound steer.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.568
Hey, hey!
That is not 800 pounds, knucklehead.

05:18.736 --> 05:22.030
Charlie "the Can Do Kid" Kenton.

05:22.198 --> 05:23.781
Time has not
been good to you, my friend.

05:23.949 --> 05:25.617
Ricky, we got a problem here.
A big problem.

05:25.784 --> 05:28.453
Whoa, hey, slow down there, hoss.

05:28.621 --> 05:30.330
Come on, last time I saw you,

05:30.497 --> 05:33.082
you were staring up at the ceiling
at the Sam Houston Center

05:33.250 --> 05:35.543
with the taste of my right cross
all over your face.

05:35.711 --> 05:37.712
Pow!

05:37.880 --> 05:40.006
- Are we good to go here?
- Yeah.

05:40.174 --> 05:43.593
We agreed that my boxer would fight
an 800-pound steer for three grand.

05:43.761 --> 05:45.386
- Am I right?
- Yes, sir. We did.

05:45.554 --> 05:47.513
- That bull is, like, 2,000 pounds.
- Right, OK.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.390
Well, Charlie, I'll tell you something.

05:49.558 --> 05:52.560
Your bot don't fight,
you don't get paid! Whoo!

05:52.728 --> 05:54.437
How about that?

05:55.481 --> 05:57.982
Get the hell out of here.

05:58.150 --> 06:00.193
All right, all right.

06:01.487 --> 06:02.904
Why don't we
make this more interesting?

06:03.072 --> 06:04.781
My bot against your bull, straight up.

06:04.949 --> 06:06.741
- How much?
- Twenty grand, winner takes all.

06:06.909 --> 06:09.702
- You got 20 grand, Charlie?
- In a safe in my truck.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.250
All right, Charlie.
I'll tell you what,

06:15.417 --> 06:18.670
twenty grand it is,
but if you lose and you welch,

06:18.837 --> 06:21.506
I'm gonna come after you and beat you
to within an inch of your life.

06:21.674 --> 06:23.841
And you know that I can do that
because I already done it!

06:24.009 --> 06:25.468
What's the problem with you, man?
In life you get too close,

06:25.636 --> 06:27.595
in the ring you
stand back like a girl. Just shake.

06:27.763 --> 06:29.305
All right, Charlie.

06:29.473 --> 06:31.015
Shake and pow!
Just like that once again.

06:31.183 --> 06:33.017
You want to dance again?
You wanna dance?

06:33.185 --> 06:34.602
Come on, cheer for this guy.
Give him some luck.

06:34.770 --> 06:36.562
He needs some luck, y'all.
Yahoo! Let's get going!

06:36.730 --> 06:40.191
Don't touch that bull.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.860
Ladies and gentlemen, I got to ask,

06:43.028 --> 06:45.280
do we have any fans
of robot boxing here today?

06:47.574 --> 06:50.243
Now, listen, friends, I understand,

06:50.411 --> 06:54.163
we can't all afford to go all
the way over there to Dallas

06:54.331 --> 06:59.210
and pay $300 for one of those World
Robot Boxing League fights. I get it.

06:59.378 --> 07:02.463
So, I decided that I would
bring a robot boxing match

07:02.631 --> 07:06.050
right here to our little fair
here in San Leandro.

07:06.218 --> 07:08.136
How about that?

07:08.304 --> 07:09.804
All right.

07:11.056 --> 07:13.891
Ladies and gentlemen,
I introduce to you,

07:14.059 --> 07:18.771
- Ambush!
- Let's do it!

07:21.317 --> 07:22.900
All right, big fella.

07:26.697 --> 07:28.364
Whoo-hoo!

07:28.532 --> 07:30.325
He's a big fella, ain't he?

07:30.492 --> 07:33.995
Take a turn.
Let them see how beautiful you are.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.248
Yeah.

07:37.416 --> 07:39.751
Show them some power.

07:41.003 --> 07:43.629
Look at that.
He's getting all kung fu-y on us.

07:43.797 --> 07:47.133
- Yeah!
- Yeah, big fella.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.552
Ambush's opponent today,
he's last year's runner-up

07:49.720 --> 07:51.763
in the baddest
of the bulls competition,

07:51.930 --> 07:57.393
ladies and gentlemen, Black Thunder!

07:59.897 --> 08:01.522
- Let's get it on!
- Let's get this thing started.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.652
Is that all you got?

08:08.447 --> 08:10.698
Yeah, brother. Bring it on.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.210
Take him, take him.

08:24.630 --> 08:27.131
Ambush lays the smackdown
on that prime beef.

08:27.299 --> 08:28.424
Woo woo!

08:33.097 --> 08:35.181
I got more for you, big fella.
We're just getting started.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.144
OK. Jump, now!

08:43.732 --> 08:45.066
Boo-yah!

08:48.195 --> 08:49.404
- Dang it!
- Ambush, decks

08:49.571 --> 08:51.447
Black Thunder
but when you mess with the bull,

08:51.615 --> 08:53.282
you're going to get the horns.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.578
You like that. I can tell.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.539
You like that.

08:59.706 --> 09:00.832
Jeez! Turn around!

09:05.254 --> 09:07.713
Ricky! Ricky, stop this thing!

09:18.016 --> 09:19.392
Come on, come on.
We're still in this thing.

09:19.560 --> 09:20.852
We're still in this. Just hop. Hop.

09:22.187 --> 09:23.396
That's it. Come on.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.944
Ricky, enough! Enough!

09:30.112 --> 09:33.239
I can't hear you over the sound
of your robot being destroyed.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.493
Kill! Kill! Kill!

09:37.661 --> 09:39.454
All right, come on. Get up.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.874
Get up. Come on!

09:44.501 --> 09:45.960
No!

09:50.549 --> 09:53.217
C'mon. No, no, no!

09:59.558 --> 10:01.100
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it

10:01.268 --> 10:05.730
for our warriors out here today
at the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.

10:05.898 --> 10:07.815
Now, thank you all for coming out,

10:07.983 --> 10:11.235
and we'll see you next time,
because there will be one.

10:11.403 --> 10:13.696
Hey, hey! Give me that leg.

10:13.864 --> 10:15.698
Sure. For five dollars.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.533
Boo-yah!

10:17.701 --> 10:20.286
Whoo! All right!

10:20.454 --> 10:24.540
That was ridonculous fun,
now wasn't it, ladies and gentlemen?

10:25.375 --> 10:28.669
I'm going to come by for my money,
Charlie boy. You best have it.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.838
- Everybody say "hey!"
- Hey!

10:31.006 --> 10:34.717
- Everybody say "ho!"
- Ho!

10:34.885 --> 10:38.137
How about that?
How you doing there, little robot?

10:54.821 --> 10:57.240
My keys, damn it.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.408
One more step
and I'll drop you like your girlfriend.

10:59.576 --> 11:00.826
Charlie, relax.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.537
I'm not paying you.
That was a bogus fight.

11:02.704 --> 11:04.789
- It cost me my last robot.
- Just listen to us.

11:05.123 --> 11:08.417
- Do you recall Caroline Fallon?
- She's my ex-girlfriend.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.087
I haven't seen her in like ten years.
What does she want?

11:11.255 --> 11:14.632
- Nothing. She died.
- Do you recall Max Kenton?

11:16.468 --> 11:18.094
He's my son.
He's got to be like nine.

11:18.262 --> 11:19.929
- Eleven.
- Eleven. OK.

11:21.598 --> 11:22.848
Is he dead, too?

11:23.016 --> 11:25.851
No, he's fine.
That's why we're here.

11:52.170 --> 11:55.798
This court is convened
to address the custodial status

11:55.966 --> 11:59.010
of one Max Kenton, age 11.

11:59.177 --> 12:01.095
Mother, Caroline Fallon, deceased.

12:01.263 --> 12:02.888
Father, Charles Kenton.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.099
Debra Fallon Barnes,
you're the boy's aunt.

12:05.267 --> 12:08.728
Yes. As I've already told you,

12:08.895 --> 12:10.855
my husband, Marvin, is wealthy,

12:11.023 --> 12:14.191
and we can more than provide for Max.

12:14.359 --> 12:17.987
I appreciate that, but per Texas
state law, without a written will

12:18.155 --> 12:19.739
next of kin retains custody.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.950
Charles Kenton, who is aware
of this custody hearing,

12:23.118 --> 12:24.619
and we are expecting him...

12:24.786 --> 12:27.288
No, I need a new robot now.

12:27.456 --> 12:29.624
I had a big fight
for Ambush next Saturday.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.292
I got to show up with something.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.544
Noisy Boy is for sale?

12:33.712 --> 12:37.214
In his day, Noisy Boy was a killer.
How much?

12:37.382 --> 12:39.550
That's a good deal.
What's wrong with him?

12:39.718 --> 12:41.636
I can live with that.

12:43.013 --> 12:44.180
Well, I don't have it have it.

12:44.348 --> 12:47.058
Charles Kenton waived all
of his rights to custody

12:47.225 --> 12:51.062
right after the boy was born.
I can more than provide for Max.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.272
Whoa.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.690
Please be Charles Kenton.

12:55.609 --> 12:58.402
Uh... Charlie, yeah.

12:58.570 --> 13:01.489
I'm here to sign some paper

13:01.657 --> 13:04.950
that releases my rights
to the custody of my son.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.036
That's why I'm here.
Do I need to be here?

13:07.204 --> 13:09.455
Charlie.

13:09.623 --> 13:12.166
Do you even remember me?

13:12.334 --> 13:14.877
- Debra, Caroline's sister.
- Yeah, sure, Debra. How are you?

13:15.045 --> 13:16.045
- Mr. Kenton.
- Yeah.

13:16.213 --> 13:17.254
Please take a seat.

13:19.883 --> 13:22.510
Your Honor, may I please go
and see my nephew now?

13:22.678 --> 13:24.011
Yes, you may.

13:24.179 --> 13:26.389
- How about you, Mr. Kenton?
- What?

13:26.556 --> 13:28.557
You can spend some time with him,
if you'd like.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.351
- With the kid?
- Yeah, the kid.

13:30.519 --> 13:32.311
- Max. Your son?
- All right, all right.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.231
You've been working with those robots
for so long, you've become one.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.651
Honey, you wait right here.
I'm going to be back.

13:38.819 --> 13:41.445
You take all the time you need,
sweetheart.

13:46.868 --> 13:50.079
Your Honor,
I'd like to, at this juncture,

13:50.247 --> 13:52.957
step out and call my attorney,
if that's all right.

13:53.125 --> 13:54.417
Please.

13:57.796 --> 14:00.548
Come on. Come on.

14:00.716 --> 14:02.591
There you are.

14:02.759 --> 14:05.177
He'll be in a foster home.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.180
No, they find good families.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.015
Young, energetic. Yeah.

14:11.268 --> 14:14.228
Thanks, Michael. I will. OK.

14:14.396 --> 14:15.563
Oh, hey.

14:15.731 --> 14:17.690
Hey, um...

14:17.858 --> 14:20.901
- Marvin Barnes. I'm Debra's husband.
- Right, yeah.

14:21.069 --> 14:23.863
You know,
Debra really wants to adopt Max.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.449
And...

14:26.616 --> 14:29.618
- I'm up for it, but...
- Seventy-five grand.

14:30.454 --> 14:31.746
$75,000?

14:31.913 --> 14:35.124
- You're serious?
- Mm-hmm.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.461
The thing is...

14:39.337 --> 14:41.088
...we're supposed to go
to Italy this summer

14:41.256 --> 14:44.925
with my oldest friend and his wife.
Two months in Tuscany and all over.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.594
Just the four of you. Sounds nice.

14:46.762 --> 14:49.972
We'll be back in New York
by the end of August.

14:50.140 --> 14:53.267
In August. A hundred.

14:53.435 --> 14:55.352
- $100,000?
- You heard me.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.772
- You're crazy.
- Not nearly as crazy as your wife

14:57.939 --> 15:01.192
if you tell her I just signed
over that kid to the state of Texas.

15:01.359 --> 15:04.987
The way I see it, there's a real way
everyone gets what they want here.

15:05.155 --> 15:07.281
So here's what you're going to do.

15:07.449 --> 15:10.326
You're going to tell your wife
I'll only sign over custody to her

15:10.494 --> 15:12.787
if I get to spend the summer
with the kid first.

15:12.954 --> 15:15.372
Just tell her how guilty
she made me feel

15:15.540 --> 15:19.543
for being such a terrible absentee dad
how I want to make good with junior,

15:19.711 --> 15:21.712
a little fatherly bonding, whatnot.

15:21.880 --> 15:26.175
She'll buy it, you get to be the hero,
and everybody wins.

15:29.095 --> 15:32.890
OK. But not a word about the money
to Debra, you understand?

15:34.059 --> 15:35.267
I understand.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.812
I'll give you 50 grand tonight
when we drop off Max

15:37.979 --> 15:39.980
and the other 50
when we get back in August

15:40.148 --> 15:42.233
and you deliver him to us in New York.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.610
Pleasure doing business with you.

15:47.322 --> 15:49.698
Your Honor, I'm really happy
we all took the time

15:49.866 --> 15:51.408
to make the best decision for everyone.

15:54.663 --> 15:56.330
- Happy?
- Yeah, it's me.

15:56.498 --> 15:59.500
I'm buying Noisy Boy.
I got the money.

15:59.668 --> 16:02.837
Take him to Tallet's Gym
and I'll meet you there.

16:17.644 --> 16:18.644
Hello?

16:19.855 --> 16:21.272
Bailey?

16:21.439 --> 16:23.065
Some guy is here
with the robot you're buying,

16:23.233 --> 16:24.358
and I gotta tell ya, Charlie,

16:24.526 --> 16:27.278
- it smells like disaster to me.
- Nice to see you, too, Bailey.

16:27.445 --> 16:30.406
- Might I also say how cute you look.
- Give it up, Charlie.

16:30.574 --> 16:32.491
God, I need a shower.
You want to take a shower?

16:32.659 --> 16:35.536
- Come on.
- Let me make something clear.

16:35.704 --> 16:38.539
A creepy dude with a robot in a box

16:38.707 --> 16:41.083
has been sitting outside my gym
for two hours.

16:41.251 --> 16:43.377
Now, putting aside the fact
that you're doing

16:43.545 --> 16:46.130
what I'm guessing is a black market deal
on my doorstep,

16:46.298 --> 16:48.215
how are you gonna pay him
when Ambush just got destroyed?

16:48.383 --> 16:50.551
The money is on its way.
Just, you know, distract him.

16:50.719 --> 16:52.595
- I have been. It's exhausting.
- You're the best.

16:52.762 --> 16:53.846
- Yeah? Really?
- Mm-hmm.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.973
Is that why
you're buying a $45,000 robot

16:56.141 --> 16:57.141
when you owe me six grand in rent?

16:57.309 --> 16:58.267
- Because I'm the best?
- Three.

16:58.435 --> 16:59.560
- No, six.
- Whoa.

16:59.728 --> 17:03.689
No, listen, Charlie. There is a guy with
real money who wants to buy this place.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.025
Come on, like you're really
going to sell your dad's gym.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.776
If you don't make rent,
I can't make payments

17:07.944 --> 17:09.278
and I won't have a choice.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.946
Your father would climb out of his grave
and kick your ass if you sold this place.

17:12.281 --> 17:15.075
My father would climb out of his grave
and kick your ass.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.579
Bailey.

17:24.085 --> 17:25.502
- Don't.
- Don't what?

17:25.670 --> 17:27.296
Don't do that. Don't... that...

17:27.464 --> 17:29.089
Hey.

17:29.257 --> 17:31.216
- Don't what?
- Don't do that thing.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.679
- No, you like that thing.
- No.

17:35.847 --> 17:37.973
- Yeah.
- No, I don't like that thing.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.059
I used to. Once. Briefly.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.061
Now I like money more.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.939
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.610
Marvin.

17:50.654 --> 17:51.904
Your money has arrived.

17:54.282 --> 17:55.908
Marv.

17:59.996 --> 18:02.873
Fifty grand, as promised.

18:03.041 --> 18:06.001
- Now, here are all our numbers
- Right.

18:06.169 --> 18:08.462
- and contact info over in Europe.
- All right.

18:08.630 --> 18:10.047
So that's everything there.

18:13.343 --> 18:16.095
So Marvin tells me you want
this time with Max.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.472
- Yeah, yeah.
- You did the right thing

18:18.640 --> 18:21.141
giving me custody. I think
Caroline would have wanted that.

18:21.309 --> 18:22.768
Yeah.

18:22.936 --> 18:25.270
Now, have him back in New York
on August 27th.

18:26.523 --> 18:27.648
That's a deal.

18:27.816 --> 18:30.818
- OK, well, let's go get Max.
- OK.

18:30.985 --> 18:33.654
OK? Let's get Max.

18:35.699 --> 18:39.284
It's OK. You want me to go on the
other side here and I'll get Max?

18:40.286 --> 18:42.871
Hey, Max.

18:43.039 --> 18:45.249
See you, pal.

18:45.417 --> 18:47.960
Max, we'll see you
at the end of the summer, honey.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.138
I'm Charlie.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.853
It's been a long time.
You know, I'm your...

19:06.020 --> 19:08.063
- You screwed me.
- Nice mouth.

19:08.231 --> 19:09.273
Do you know where they're going?

19:09.441 --> 19:11.442
- Italy?
- Yeah, Italy.

19:11.609 --> 19:13.652
- So how did I get stuck here with you?
- Relax, kid.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.113
You got a whole life
of fine living ahead of you.

19:16.281 --> 19:19.908
Charlie, dude's pissed.
He's going to take off.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.327
- Yeah, OK.
- Did Marvin give you that money?

19:22.495 --> 19:25.789
Here, just close the deal.
I'll be right there, OK?

19:26.499 --> 19:28.667
- OK?
- Hey.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.127
Hey.

19:30.295 --> 19:33.046
- I'm Bailey.
- Max.

19:34.466 --> 19:36.258
Max Kenton.

19:37.427 --> 19:39.261
- Wow, OK, so this is your...
- Yeah, it's him.

19:39.429 --> 19:41.555
Don't worry about it, OK?

19:41.723 --> 19:42.973
I'm standing here looking at you two...

19:43.141 --> 19:46.185
Just go and put Noisy in the shop,
please? Thank you.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.568
So listen, you're going to stay here
with her while I'm on the road.

19:54.736 --> 19:55.986
How much did he give you, huh?

19:56.154 --> 19:58.030
You're coming
at this the wrong way, kid.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.323
No, tell me. I want to know.

20:00.450 --> 20:02.868
50,000. OK?

20:03.036 --> 20:05.162
He gave me $50,000
to sign you over to her.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.247
Will you shut up now?

20:07.415 --> 20:08.624
You sold me?

20:10.335 --> 20:11.376
Sounds worse than it is.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.171
- Really.
- It's just to take care of you.

20:14.339 --> 20:16.256
Give me half the money
and you won't have to.

20:16.424 --> 20:19.259
- Where are you going to go?
- Give me the money. I'll be fine.

20:19.427 --> 20:21.011
I told your aunt I'll get you
to New York at the end of the summer.

20:21.179 --> 20:22.721
Now you're concerned for Aunt Debra?

20:23.598 --> 20:26.099
You sold me for 50 grand.
You owe me half!

20:26.267 --> 20:28.143
I don't have it!
I spent the money on a robot.

20:28.311 --> 20:30.521
It's gone! OK? Gone!

20:30.688 --> 20:32.314
I'm through here.

20:40.490 --> 20:41.990
All right, what do we got?

20:42.992 --> 20:45.202
Noisy Boy has arrived.

20:45.370 --> 20:48.080
That's a lot of airline stickers
and customs tags.

20:48.248 --> 20:51.500
- Yep, he's been all over the world.
- London, Japan, Brazil, São Paulo...

20:51.668 --> 20:54.253
Hasn't seen North American soil
in over two years.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.755
Maybe that's why you got such
a good price, genius.

20:59.467 --> 21:02.010
Decided to stay, huh?

21:02.178 --> 21:04.304
This is Bailey. She'll be looking
after you for a few weeks.

21:04.472 --> 21:05.389
- What?
- By the way,

21:05.557 --> 21:07.975
I need you to look after the kid
for a few weeks or, like, eight.

21:08.142 --> 21:12.187
- I want half that money.
- Are we back to this again?

21:12.856 --> 21:14.565
Is there a real robot boxer in there?

21:14.732 --> 21:16.275
Noisy Boy's in there.
Have you ever heard of him?

21:16.442 --> 21:20.445
Of course. He fought Rubicon
for the WRB belt in 2016.

21:26.452 --> 21:28.453
Holy crap, he looks amazing.

21:30.290 --> 21:32.332
Well, his composite armor
has been replaced.

21:32.500 --> 21:33.959
Let's see if the insides look as good.

21:34.127 --> 21:37.796
I've watched that fight
with Rubicon like 20 times.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.840
He should have had him
in the third round

21:40.008 --> 21:42.843
but Rubicon got lucky
with a huge right and ended it.

21:56.733 --> 21:58.025
Relax, kid. he's on our side.

21:58.192 --> 22:00.736
- Not funny.
- Kind of funny.

22:00.904 --> 22:02.446
You know he
has voice recognition, right?

22:02.614 --> 22:04.448
- No, he doesn't.
- He didn't in the League.

22:04.616 --> 22:06.491
When Noisy fought in Brazil,
they must have put it in.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.286
Brazilians are crazy about
that talk-to-your-robot crap.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.874
Right, left, uppercut!

22:17.378 --> 22:21.006
Doesn't work.
Right, left, uppercut!

22:21.174 --> 22:23.383
I knew that price was too good
to be true. We got screwed.

22:23.551 --> 22:24.801
Give me a second.
Let me see if I can fix it.

22:24.969 --> 22:26.762
God, look how good he looks, too.

22:26.930 --> 22:28.347
Give me two seconds.
Let me look at something!

22:28.514 --> 22:29.765
Why didn't you ask the guy
to have a look at it?

22:29.933 --> 22:31.099
Relax!

22:34.771 --> 22:37.272
Whoa, whoa.
What was that? Was that Japanese?

22:42.654 --> 22:44.404
Let me see if I can reset him
to English. Hang on.

22:44.572 --> 22:47.407
- How the hell do you know Japanese?
- Video games.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.160
You play video games
in Japanese?

22:50.328 --> 22:52.079
Japanese bootlegs are always better.

22:57.919 --> 23:01.129
- Give me that.
- OK, so he's reset to English,

23:01.297 --> 23:03.340
and I found his command matrix.

23:03.508 --> 23:05.008
They have pre-loaded a bunch
of combinations.

23:05.176 --> 23:08.345
- They should be listed here.
- Right.

23:08.513 --> 23:10.973
Uh... Top salvo!

23:12.350 --> 23:15.268
What did I tell you?

23:16.562 --> 23:18.271
Gravity One Downtown!

23:21.609 --> 23:24.444
I was due for some good luck!

23:24.612 --> 23:26.321
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

23:26.489 --> 23:29.366
Bailey, help me put him in the truck.
I am going to go and get your money.

23:42.714 --> 23:45.173
- Give me the keys.
- I'm coming with you.

23:45.341 --> 23:46.842
- No, you're not.
- Why not?

23:47.010 --> 23:48.802
Because I don't want you with me, OK?

23:48.970 --> 23:52.764
I'm either coming with you, or you're
fishing for your keys in the sewer.

23:52.932 --> 23:56.018
Your choice.
What's it going to be, old man?

23:57.562 --> 24:01.148
Oh, my God. That was close, wasn't it?

24:01.315 --> 24:02.274
Don't do that again.

24:02.442 --> 24:05.027
- Don't, don't, don't.
- That's scaring you, isn't it?

24:05.194 --> 24:08.030
- Don't do this again? Whoa, whoa!
- Get in. Just get in, will ya?

24:08.197 --> 24:09.197
Give me the keys first.

24:09.365 --> 24:10.699
No, you can wait
till I get in the truck.

24:10.867 --> 24:12.993
Thanks, Big Pops.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.000
Sweet ride.

24:20.168 --> 24:22.169
Put on your seatbelt
and don't talk.

24:43.357 --> 24:45.692
I'm taking all bets!

25:11.219 --> 25:13.011
Keep up. Stay close.

25:14.806 --> 25:16.473
Hey, hey, hey!

25:16.641 --> 25:19.101
Charlie Kenton is in the house!

25:19.268 --> 25:20.352
All right, all right.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.604
- Come on, man!
- Hey, Finn.

25:22.772 --> 25:25.816
- Is that Noisy Boy?
- The one and only.

25:25.983 --> 25:30.153
That's Noisy Boy!

25:32.323 --> 25:34.825
Noisy's been in Japan.
Softer bots over there.

25:34.992 --> 25:36.243
You sure you want
to fight him tonight?

25:36.410 --> 25:39.496
What do you got, Finn? He can take any
bot in this place. You know it.

25:39.664 --> 25:42.624
You can have
any undercard you want.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.126
- Five thousand guaranteed.
- Come on, man.

25:44.293 --> 25:47.295
A thousand
every round your bot survives.

25:47.463 --> 25:49.840
Fight till the death!

25:52.051 --> 25:54.386
No. Give me the main event.

25:54.554 --> 25:56.680
- Come on, Charlie.
- Finn, this is Noisy Boy.

25:56.848 --> 25:58.557
An original Tak Mashido bot.

25:58.724 --> 26:01.351
He was a World Robot League boxer.
Come on!

26:04.147 --> 26:05.981
You want to fight Midas?

26:06.149 --> 26:09.276
Fifty thousand guaranteed,
winner takes all.

26:10.194 --> 26:12.237
Fifty? Really, 50?

26:12.405 --> 26:13.613
Now you're talking.

26:13.781 --> 26:15.657
Listen, listen. No, look.

26:15.825 --> 26:17.450
- Listen!
- Give me a sec.

26:17.618 --> 26:19.452
We should take an undercard fight,
make a little cash

26:19.620 --> 26:20.829
and get the hell out of here!

26:20.997 --> 26:22.372
All right, first, there is no "we."

26:22.540 --> 26:25.667
Second, he's going to crush Midas,
and I'm going to make real cash!

26:26.794 --> 26:28.420
We'll take Midas!

26:36.554 --> 26:38.930
Yeah!

26:40.892 --> 26:43.560
Tonight, our main event

26:43.728 --> 26:48.648
features the gold-blooded killer!

26:50.151 --> 26:52.611
This pimped-out punk

26:52.778 --> 26:57.115
is programmed for pain!

26:57.283 --> 27:02.287
I give to you the mighty Midas!

27:18.346 --> 27:19.554
Whoo!

27:43.246 --> 27:46.081
Against a bot

27:46.249 --> 27:51.044
who ran with the big boys in the WRB!

27:52.046 --> 27:57.050
He's been on an exile tour overseas,
but now he's back home

27:57.218 --> 27:59.511
and he's ready to make some noise!

27:59.679 --> 28:02.931
Take your first look in a long time

28:03.099 --> 28:05.934
at Noisy Boy!

28:45.808 --> 28:47.892
Crash Palace,

28:48.060 --> 28:52.939
who's ready for some destruction?!

28:54.150 --> 28:57.694
Let's make some money! Come on!

28:57.862 --> 29:00.613
We have Midas against Noisy Boy.

29:00.781 --> 29:02.991
Noisy Boy against Midas.

29:03.159 --> 29:06.369
You've been waiting all night
for this matchup, Crash Palace!

29:12.543 --> 29:13.752
Scimitar right!

29:16.964 --> 29:18.673
Did you see that?

29:18.841 --> 29:21.801
Easy money, easy money all night.
All night long!

29:21.969 --> 29:25.096
Come on! It's not over yet. Let's go!

29:25.848 --> 29:27.390
Skull salvo! Firefight!

29:30.019 --> 29:32.896
- Yeah! Go, Noisy!
- Undercard, huh?

29:35.733 --> 29:36.816
Shockfist!

29:40.112 --> 29:41.863
Get in there. Shogun Trinity!

29:43.449 --> 29:45.742
Let's finish him. Gravity Slam, Uptown!

29:49.121 --> 29:50.705
This son-of-a-bitch is crazy!

29:50.873 --> 29:51.998
Get up!

29:53.209 --> 29:55.418
Full Metal Feud! Bring it!

29:59.006 --> 30:00.548
Southpaw! Pain Revolution!

30:02.259 --> 30:03.259
I got something for you.

30:04.470 --> 30:08.556
Don't you run from me!
You can't run from me!

30:09.600 --> 30:10.642
Get up!

30:13.854 --> 30:15.271
That's illegal!

30:15.439 --> 30:17.273
This is the underworld, kid.
There are no rules!

30:18.109 --> 30:19.692
Now we're seeing
the Midas touch.

30:19.860 --> 30:21.069
No. Hands up!

30:21.237 --> 30:24.322
Get back in that corner, bitch,
and take this whooping like a man!

30:28.202 --> 30:29.786
He's getting killed in there!

30:32.331 --> 30:36.584
It's a headset! You talk into it
and you tell him what to do!

30:36.752 --> 30:38.169
Panic Shield!

30:39.046 --> 30:41.172
That's it. One-Two Overlord!

30:45.302 --> 30:47.595
No, no. Shatter Punch!

30:52.143 --> 30:53.977
- Five Recall!
- Get some!

30:57.773 --> 30:59.649
Jeez, damn it.

30:59.817 --> 31:01.192
Jab, jab!

31:08.534 --> 31:10.285
Right roundhouse! Roundhouse!

31:10.453 --> 31:13.163
Did he just spit
his juice in Midas's face?

31:13.330 --> 31:15.832
No, you did not spit in Midas's face!

31:16.000 --> 31:19.752
- It's party time now, Crash Palace!
- Use your left!

31:20.629 --> 31:22.922
Noisy's trying to do something
with his one arm!

31:23.090 --> 31:25.717
But Midas pins him,
and Daddy goes to work!

31:31.223 --> 31:33.600
No, no, no! Get up!

31:35.144 --> 31:36.144
Get some!

31:36.312 --> 31:37.770
He's got...
Just gotta get to the bell.

31:37.938 --> 31:40.106
Move! Get out of the corner!

31:42.610 --> 31:45.111
Midas! Midas! Midas!

31:45.279 --> 31:48.865
Somebody's ready
to serve up a decappuccino!

31:49.033 --> 31:51.951
I got something for you!
You ready?

31:52.119 --> 31:56.414
Good night!
That's a home run for Midas.

31:56.582 --> 31:59.626
And so long to Noisy Boy.

32:12.389 --> 32:15.808
Midas! Midas! Midas!

32:31.700 --> 32:34.577
Well, that sucked. You hungry?

32:34.745 --> 32:36.955
I saved what's left
of Noisy's voice recognition board.

32:37.122 --> 32:39.958
Other than that, he's trash.
I got to get a new robot together.

32:40.125 --> 32:43.545
I need to find a mainframe. What?

32:43.712 --> 32:45.547
- I hate hamburgers.
- What kid hates burgers?

32:45.714 --> 32:47.215
Fine, more for me.

32:47.591 --> 32:48.925
Here, drink this.

32:49.093 --> 32:50.677
You never should have taken that fight.

32:50.844 --> 32:53.555
Really? Really? Thanks, genius.

32:53.722 --> 32:56.474
Do you even think about the stuff you do
before you do it?

32:56.642 --> 32:58.726
You had no idea how to fight that fight.

32:58.894 --> 33:02.397
Those combination codes, you didn't
know what half of them even meant.

33:02.565 --> 33:04.816
You threw them in there cocky
and half-assed.

33:04.984 --> 33:06.734
Of course he lost.
You never gave him a chance.

33:06.902 --> 33:09.487
- He wasn't that good.
- Noisy Boy was a great robot.

33:09.655 --> 33:12.407
Was. Was a great robot back
in the League, back in the day.

33:12.575 --> 33:14.117
But look around you, kid. This place...

33:14.285 --> 33:16.536
This place is where once great robots
go to die.

33:16.704 --> 33:19.289
So throw him away.
That's what you do, right?

33:19.456 --> 33:21.332
Anything you don't need
you just throw away.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.378
Wow.

33:27.006 --> 33:28.006
It's been a long night.

33:28.173 --> 33:31.134
If you want to sleep indoors tonight,
shut up and get in the truck.

33:31.302 --> 33:33.886
Don't look at me like that way.
Get in the truck!

34:01.248 --> 34:04.292
Well, they gave me 400 for his head.

34:22.143 --> 34:24.478
You stay put.
I'm going to go look for some parts.

34:24.647 --> 34:26.230
- I'm coming with you.
- Huh?

34:26.398 --> 34:27.774
That drink has my heart pounding.

34:27.940 --> 34:30.109
If I sit in this truck by myself,
my head will explode.

34:30.277 --> 34:31.735
Whatever. Just keep up.

34:42.121 --> 34:44.248
Crap.

34:44.416 --> 34:45.625
Stay back, stay back, stay back.

34:56.969 --> 34:59.847
All right, keep up.

35:00.849 --> 35:01.974
These searchlights are automated,

35:02.142 --> 35:04.435
but you got to time them right,
so stay close.

35:05.521 --> 35:07.021
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:07.189 --> 35:09.941
Keep up. It's all right.

35:10.109 --> 35:12.610
All right. Come on, come on.

35:13.278 --> 35:15.238
- We're going to get caught.
- Come on.

35:16.240 --> 35:18.908
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

35:19.076 --> 35:23.037
Quick, quick. Down in here! Go, go, go!

35:26.375 --> 35:28.209
Robots are on the east side.
We got to be quick in here.

35:30.713 --> 35:32.213
Once we're through here,
there's no more searchlights.

35:32.381 --> 35:34.173
Quick! Go, go, go!

35:50.065 --> 35:52.316
- Here it is.
- What are we looking for?

35:52.484 --> 35:55.236
Anything. Anything I could use
to put a fighting bot together.

35:55.404 --> 35:56.654
- Hey, look.
- What?

35:58.866 --> 36:01.409
It's so small.

36:01.577 --> 36:04.620
Yeah. That's before your time.
That's a Generation One,

36:04.788 --> 36:07.832
the very first fighting bot.
They wanted them to look like us.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.917
The more human, the better.

36:10.085 --> 36:12.628
Crazy how quick everything changed.
Here, put that in the cart.

36:12.796 --> 36:14.005
What changed?

36:14.173 --> 36:16.048
A good question.
Boxing, human boxing.

36:16.216 --> 36:18.009
- It just faded.
- Why?

36:18.177 --> 36:20.303
Because the money moved on.

36:20.471 --> 36:22.972
People wanted more carnage,
more show.

36:23.140 --> 36:25.349
You had the whole Brazilian
underground,

36:25.517 --> 36:28.352
the Gracies, the Machados,
jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai,

36:28.520 --> 36:31.564
and 1,000 styles in between.
Full-on ground-and-pound.

36:31.732 --> 36:32.857
- Look at this.
- What's that?

36:33.025 --> 36:35.818
- I don't know.
- Not bad. Good spot, kid.

36:35.986 --> 36:39.113
You still had human fighters,
human bodies

36:39.281 --> 36:41.449
so you couldn't
give the people what they really wanted:

36:41.617 --> 36:44.786
true, no-holds-barred violence.

36:46.663 --> 36:48.664
So the next logical step:

36:48.832 --> 36:51.876
get the humans out of there
and let the machines kill each other.

36:53.170 --> 36:55.087
Do you miss it?

36:56.381 --> 36:59.467
- Boxing. Do you miss it?
- Careful.

36:59.635 --> 37:01.135
What? I want to know.

37:01.303 --> 37:02.970
Careful, you're on a cliff.

37:06.141 --> 37:07.099
Whoa!

37:07.267 --> 37:10.603
That's a long way down.
If you fell, you'd definitely...

37:13.690 --> 37:17.109
- Charlie!
- Max!

37:19.363 --> 37:21.781
Charlie, help me!

37:46.181 --> 37:50.434
Charlie!

37:50.602 --> 37:52.603
Max! Max!

37:52.771 --> 37:55.314
Max!

37:56.358 --> 37:57.441
Max! Max!

37:57.609 --> 38:01.529
- Try not to move!
- I'm on some sort of robot arm.

38:01.697 --> 38:05.658
Wait! Just easy, easy.
Give me your hand. Nice and easy.

38:05.826 --> 38:08.953
Very slowly. Good. OK, don't look down.

38:09.121 --> 38:12.540
Look at me. Look at me.
That's it! I've got you, Max!

38:12.708 --> 38:14.208
You don't have to be scared. I got you!

38:14.376 --> 38:16.711
- It's so far!
- It's OK. I got you.

38:16.879 --> 38:19.213
Give me your other hand.
Nice and slow.

38:19.381 --> 38:21.966
Just give me your other hand
very slowly.

38:22.134 --> 38:24.260
Reach back. Come on. Reach!

38:25.178 --> 38:27.471
All right, look at me.
We're going to do this together.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.390
You and me.
Just look at me.

38:29.558 --> 38:31.601
That's it. That's it.

38:31.768 --> 38:35.313
One... two... three!

38:37.399 --> 38:39.317
That's it. I got you!

38:39.484 --> 38:42.737
I got you. I got you. I got you.

38:42.905 --> 38:46.240
I got you. I got you.

38:48.952 --> 38:51.162
You're safe. You're safe.

38:55.083 --> 38:57.001
All right, I got you.

38:57.169 --> 38:58.461
- You all right?
- Yeah.

38:58.629 --> 39:00.546
Come here. Easy. Easy.

39:02.382 --> 39:03.799
You all right?

39:03.967 --> 39:06.010
- You all right?
- Yeah.

39:06.178 --> 39:07.887
I told you it was dangerous.

39:08.722 --> 39:10.473
Careful. We're still on the edge here.

39:22.736 --> 39:26.280
Charlie, I think there's
a whole robot in there.

39:26.448 --> 39:27.823
So what? Let's go. Come on.

39:28.909 --> 39:30.910
I'm taking him with me.
He saved my life.

39:31.078 --> 39:34.580
He did not save your life.
I saved your life. Let's go.

39:34.748 --> 39:37.083
Could you just bring the cart to the
edge? I'll use the winch to get him out.

39:37.250 --> 39:40.795
You want that piece of junk? You get
the cart yourself. I'm through here.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.902
This is what's left of Noisy Boy?

41:28.069 --> 41:30.196
That's it.
His head does make a nice addition

41:30.363 --> 41:33.032
to the front of the Crash Palace.

41:33.200 --> 41:35.743
- It's not funny.
- Let's get a robot, you and me.

41:35.911 --> 41:39.038
Yeah, good idea. You're broke.
I'm almost there myself.

41:39.206 --> 41:41.749
- You destroyed the best shot you had.
- We'll put one together.

41:41.917 --> 41:44.001
You're brilliant at this.
There's good stuff here.

41:44.169 --> 41:45.711
- No, there's nothing here.
- There is. Look.

41:45.879 --> 41:50.257
Charlie, all your junk is... it's junk.

41:50.425 --> 41:52.843
You're not even
in the game anymore, Charlie.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.929
- It's all garbage.
- I heard you. It's garbage.

41:55.096 --> 41:56.847
Don't get loud with me.

41:57.015 --> 41:59.141
- You're your problem, Charlie.
- What's that supposed to mean?

41:59.309 --> 42:03.354
I have been here for you a long time.
In the ring, out of the ring,

42:03.522 --> 42:05.606
and the whole ugly spiral down,
and I'm tired.

42:05.774 --> 42:09.193
My father invested everything
he had in your fight career.

42:09.361 --> 42:10.653
We loved...

42:11.571 --> 42:16.784
He loved you like family.
And this is his home.

42:16.952 --> 42:19.620
I'm just trying not to let it die.
That's my plan.

42:20.997 --> 42:22.331
What's yours?

42:34.177 --> 42:35.636
You're done, right?

42:35.804 --> 42:36.971
You're finally done?

42:37.138 --> 42:40.558
Because I sure as hell am, Charlie.

42:41.726 --> 42:43.227
I got nothing left.

42:45.313 --> 42:46.313
All right.

42:48.567 --> 42:51.402
Maybe there's something here.

42:51.570 --> 42:53.946
This robot the kid brought
in last night.

42:54.114 --> 42:55.781
Would you look at it for me?

42:56.366 --> 42:57.449
Please?

43:00.120 --> 43:01.161
Bailey?

43:06.042 --> 43:08.127
I've never seen
anything like it before.

43:08.295 --> 43:10.296
He's Generation Two, but barely.

43:10.463 --> 43:12.423
I found a power cell that fits him,

43:12.591 --> 43:15.843
and I hooked him up
to this old G-2 remote that I had, so...

43:16.011 --> 43:17.970
You can at least move him around,
Charlie, but he's crap.

43:18.138 --> 43:20.973
Maybe I can get a sparring gig for him,
make a few hundred bucks.

43:21.141 --> 43:24.101
- Charlie, stop.
- It's my robot!

43:24.269 --> 43:27.313
It took me half the night
dragging him out of there.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.064
- He's mine.
- He's yours? Yeah.

43:29.232 --> 43:31.692
But the parts we're
putting in him are mine!

43:32.777 --> 43:36.447
You idiots should see if he powers up
before you start fighting over him.

43:36.615 --> 43:37.865
What happened to you?

43:41.828 --> 43:43.412
Hey.

43:54.424 --> 43:56.467
Whoa. Whoa.

43:56.635 --> 43:58.344
Watch out. Stay back.

44:16.738 --> 44:19.782
Looks like he's got a shadow function.
That's pretty rare.

44:20.742 --> 44:22.910
He can mime your movements
and store them in memory, Max.

44:23.078 --> 44:25.245
You think there's
anything here we could use?

44:25.413 --> 44:27.247
- Not much.
- There's a bucket...

44:28.458 --> 44:30.417
There's a bucket
I use to wash the truck sometimes.

44:30.585 --> 44:33.462
Use it and clean him up.
He smells like crap.

44:33.630 --> 44:36.548
Wash yourself off, too,
while you're at it. You stink.

44:36.716 --> 44:40.260
I switched him to remote.
It's pretty basic.

44:40.428 --> 44:42.972
Just use the toggles here
to steer him and walk him.

44:43.139 --> 44:45.891
- You play video games, right?
- Of course.

44:46.059 --> 44:48.852
Same idea, only this one's
a thousand-pound robot.

44:49.562 --> 44:50.562
Cool.

45:24.973 --> 45:26.306
"Atom."

45:33.773 --> 45:36.942
His name is Atom.
Can we get him a fight?

45:37.110 --> 45:38.694
I don't think he
was ever a boxing robot.

45:38.862 --> 45:42.614
He's a G-2, built in early 2014.
He was a sparring bot.

45:42.782 --> 45:44.283
They must have built robots
like this one

45:44.451 --> 45:46.285
that could mirror the fighting style
of any other robot.

45:46.453 --> 45:48.704
OK, so can we get him a fight?

45:48.872 --> 45:51.206
Are you not listening?
He's a sparring bot.

45:51.374 --> 45:54.084
Built to take a lot of hits, but never
dishing out any real punishment.

45:54.252 --> 45:55.836
You could always sell him off for parts.

45:56.004 --> 45:57.296
Can't you get him a fight?

45:57.464 --> 45:59.506
"Why can't you get him a fight?
Get him a fight."

45:59.674 --> 46:01.467
God, you don't quit, do you?

46:01.634 --> 46:04.470
You want me to put him in some
bottom-rung scrap-fest to the death?

46:04.637 --> 46:07.389
I saw how scared you were
at Crash Palace.

46:07.557 --> 46:09.850
The places that would
let you fight this robot

46:10.018 --> 46:11.727
would make you pee your little pants.

46:11.895 --> 46:14.313
Excellent. Get him a fight.

46:20.403 --> 46:21.361
Stubborn kid.

46:21.529 --> 46:23.489
Surprise, surprise.

47:04.864 --> 47:06.198
Let's take a walk.

48:15.977 --> 48:17.394
Can you understand me?

48:25.361 --> 48:28.530
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

48:53.473 --> 48:56.016
You've known Charlie a long time.

48:56.184 --> 48:59.519
Too long.
We both kind of grew up in this gym.

49:01.439 --> 49:02.814
My dad, he trained him.

49:04.192 --> 49:06.652
That's them. That's Charlie.

49:09.072 --> 49:10.989
- What was he like?
- As a boxer?

49:11.157 --> 49:12.491
As anything.

49:12.825 --> 49:17.287
He was something.
He was lean, tough.

49:17.455 --> 49:19.289
No quit, no fear.

49:23.836 --> 49:26.546
Come here.
I want to show you something.

49:27.590 --> 49:31.677
I have this newspaper article
from Phoenix 2007

49:31.844 --> 49:35.430
when Charlie fought Nico Tandy,
the top contender.

49:35.598 --> 49:38.392
- You were at the Nico Tandy fight?
- I was.

49:38.559 --> 49:41.228
Charlie was just supposed
to be a warm-up fight, an easy win.

49:41.396 --> 49:45.023
Nico wasn't
even supposed to break a sweat

49:45.191 --> 49:50.278
but nobody told Charlie that, so he just
kept coming and coming at him.

49:50.446 --> 49:51.780
Check this out.

49:54.575 --> 49:56.493
That's Charlie.

49:57.662 --> 49:59.371
First, Nico couldn't believe the balls

49:59.706 --> 50:00.747
on this nobody.

50:00.915 --> 50:05.127
But Charlie kept coming,
and that's when Nico looked scared.

50:05.294 --> 50:07.129
- Really?
- Really.

50:07.296 --> 50:09.047
He was toying with Nico.

50:09.215 --> 50:12.092
The top contender,
number two in the world

50:12.260 --> 50:15.554
and Charlie was dancing with him.
Pop! Pop! Bam! Pop!

50:15.722 --> 50:18.765
Charlie was floating inches
off the canvas that night.

50:18.933 --> 50:21.768
He was like a ghost.
Nico couldn't even see him.

50:23.062 --> 50:24.062
I could.

50:27.233 --> 50:31.028
He was beautiful.

50:33.823 --> 50:36.533
So what happened?
Did Charlie beat Nico Tandy?

50:36.701 --> 50:40.495
No, Nico Tandy put me on my ass
in the 12th round. Twice.

50:40.663 --> 50:42.330
Second time for good. Lights out.

50:42.498 --> 50:44.583
You were ahead on the scorecards
going into the 12th round.

50:44.751 --> 50:47.627
Nico Tandy rung my bell
and went on to be the undefeated

50:47.795 --> 50:49.129
world champ for the next three years.

50:49.297 --> 50:52.007
- So he knocked you out?
- Yeah, so did a lot of guys.

50:52.175 --> 50:53.341
You knocked a lot of guys out, too.

50:53.509 --> 50:55.385
24 and 19.
It's not exactly a career.

50:55.553 --> 50:57.012
But every fight a knockout.

50:57.180 --> 50:59.056
- Yeah.
- Win or lose, fight's not over

50:59.223 --> 51:00.515
- till someone's on the mat.
- Till someone's on the mat.

51:00.683 --> 51:03.185
- Your old man taught me that.
- Damn straight he taught you that.

51:03.352 --> 51:05.604
- Who else did you fight?
- Go get your stuff together.

51:05.772 --> 51:07.647
I don't need to.
Did you fight for the title?

51:07.815 --> 51:11.068
Yeah, you do.
We leave in an hour. Go.

51:11.235 --> 51:13.570
Wow. Here.

51:14.864 --> 51:16.323
Keep it.

51:17.658 --> 51:20.202
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

51:24.874 --> 51:26.583
I like that kid.

51:27.543 --> 51:28.835
He likes you.

51:33.883 --> 51:37.302
- What I said yesterday was...
- No, nothing more to say.

51:39.180 --> 51:42.140
I'm heading off to Atlanta tonight
to see if I can get a partner

51:42.308 --> 51:43.934
or raise money to get a new bot.

51:45.186 --> 51:49.022
That's what you wanted, right?
Me gone?

51:53.236 --> 51:55.529
Yeah, that's what I wanted.

52:04.038 --> 52:05.038
OK.

52:38.823 --> 52:40.115
Hey. Hey.

52:41.117 --> 52:42.284
Look.

52:49.417 --> 52:51.960
The champ is here. Zeus is here.

52:52.128 --> 52:53.170
Yeah.

52:55.965 --> 52:59.801
<i>Zeus! No one has ever</i>
<i>gone two rounds with this monster.</i>

52:59.969 --> 53:01.136
<i>Two rounds!</i>

53:01.304 --> 53:04.681
<i>The champ puts his Real Steel world</i>
<i>championship belt on the line tonight.</i>

53:04.849 --> 53:06.808
<i>He just may have a real fight</i>
<i>on his hands.</i>

53:06.976 --> 53:10.437
<i>Zeus, greatest robot boxer</i>
<i>of all time. Ever.</i>

53:10.605 --> 53:12.230
<i>End of story. Good night!</i>

53:13.191 --> 53:16.484
- So cool. It's so cool.
- What?

53:18.821 --> 53:19.821
Come on.

53:21.616 --> 53:24.576
All right, listen up.
I got to go find Finn.

53:24.744 --> 53:27.537
- I want you to stay in this area, OK?
- OK.

53:27.705 --> 53:30.498
Out of the way. Champ coming
through. Zeus coming through.

53:30.666 --> 53:32.042
Move, move.
Champ coming through.

53:44.555 --> 53:47.641
Farra Lemkova, daughter behind
the father-daughter Zeus team.

53:47.808 --> 53:51.228
They say your father's the money
and you are the mind behind Zeus.

53:51.395 --> 53:53.355
You're very kind,

53:53.522 --> 53:55.440
but I assure you,
the mind behind Zeus

53:55.608 --> 53:57.275
belongs to the great Tak Mashido.

53:59.487 --> 54:02.197
What did it take to lure the reclusive
genius, former boy wonder

54:02.365 --> 54:04.199
and arguably the most
important bot designer

54:04.367 --> 54:07.118
in the history of the sport
out of retirement?

54:08.371 --> 54:10.372
Why don't you ask him yourself?

54:15.378 --> 54:18.421
Is this Tak Mashido's greatest creation?

54:19.590 --> 54:23.635
Zeus is autonomous and constantly
evolving during a fight.

54:23.803 --> 54:27.847
With his adaptive operating system
he recognizes patterns

54:28.015 --> 54:32.185
and rewrites his fight code
instantaneously.

54:32.353 --> 54:35.689
For myself and Joe Sixpack out there,
are you saying that Zeus...

54:35.856 --> 54:40.694
I'm saying that no matter
what happens in that ring,

54:40.861 --> 54:44.281
the result of any fight is inevitable.

54:45.449 --> 54:46.992
What Zeus sees...

54:48.494 --> 54:49.828
...he kills.

54:51.372 --> 54:52.956
Sweet.

55:22.153 --> 55:23.403
I'm never
going into business with you.

55:23.571 --> 55:25.322
I just need a break here,
Finn. C'mon.

55:25.489 --> 55:27.115
You got that old bot truck out there.

55:27.283 --> 55:29.034
- You always got something in there.
- I got an old G-2 sparring bot,

55:29.201 --> 55:32.162
ain't worth the paint left on it.
What am I supposed to do with that?

55:32.330 --> 55:35.248
The Zoo. Take him to the Zoo.
They fight there tomorrow.

55:35.416 --> 55:37.000
Even I wouldn't be caught dead
at the Zoo.

55:37.168 --> 55:39.878
I just need a little loan. Something...

55:40.046 --> 55:41.671
What?

55:42.798 --> 55:44.466
- You're serious, Charlie?
- A loan.

55:44.633 --> 55:47.719
Something. A couple hundred. Few
hundred. Whatever you got.

55:47.887 --> 55:49.763
You know I'm good for it.

55:49.930 --> 55:54.309
I know you,
and as much as I like you, dude...

55:54.477 --> 55:56.227
...you're a bad bet, brother.

56:00.149 --> 56:01.524
Right, yeah.

56:13.788 --> 56:16.206
- Get back.
- All right. All right.

56:21.379 --> 56:23.755
Did you see that?
That's what's left of Axelrod.

56:23.923 --> 56:25.840
Where you been?
I told you to stay put.

56:26.008 --> 56:27.926
You should have seen him.
Zeus was, like, amazing!

56:28.094 --> 56:30.261
- Amazing, huh?
- Unbelievable, yeah.

56:30.429 --> 56:33.431
He was just peppering Axelrod
with punches, but so fast.

56:33.599 --> 56:36.226
It was incredible.
Axelrod didn't even land a punch.

56:36.394 --> 56:38.061
He didn't even survive the first round.

56:38.229 --> 56:39.479
Is that what you think boxing is?

56:39.647 --> 56:41.731
Zeus beating up some piece
of steel that they feed him?

56:41.899 --> 56:44.651
Axelrod's not just some piece of steel.
And that is what boxing is now.

56:44.819 --> 56:47.404
Deal with it.
And I love it, and I'm in it now.

56:47.571 --> 56:50.365
You're in it now, are you?
You and your G-2 sparring bot?

56:50.533 --> 56:53.952
He's more than that. And if you'd
just get us a fight, you'd see.

56:54.120 --> 56:57.288
You're in luck, kid.
There's a lovely place called the Zoo.

56:57.456 --> 56:58.957
Tomorrow afternoon,
you'll get your fight.

56:59.125 --> 57:01.292
- Great.
- And it will be the end.

57:02.878 --> 57:05.046
I told you I hate hamburgers!

57:08.884 --> 57:10.051
It's a burrito!

57:18.853 --> 57:19.936
Right uppercut.

57:23.065 --> 57:24.149
Left uppercut.

57:27.820 --> 57:31.656
Bend your knees.
Rise up with both hands.

57:33.617 --> 57:38.455
Again. Bend your knees.
Rise up with both hands.

57:38.622 --> 57:41.958
- You been up all night?
- Yeah. I cleaned him up.

57:42.126 --> 57:44.043
I'm using shadow mode
to program some fight moves

57:44.211 --> 57:45.211
and sync them to the remote.

57:45.379 --> 57:48.631
Yeah. I saw that double-up punch
you were showing him.

57:48.799 --> 57:50.925
That's... That's lethal stuff.

57:51.093 --> 57:52.385
Let's do this.

57:52.553 --> 57:55.513
Jeez. Let's do breakfast first.

58:32.885 --> 58:34.761
You know you're
bringing him home in pieces, right?

58:37.014 --> 58:38.181
We'll see.

58:45.731 --> 58:47.774
Let me deal with this.

58:47.942 --> 58:49.275
Charlie Kenton. This is Max.

58:49.443 --> 58:51.319
Kingpin. Call me Kingpin.

58:51.487 --> 58:53.780
- All right, Kingpin, so...
- How much a round?

58:53.948 --> 58:55.615
What's this, we on a field trip?

58:57.868 --> 59:00.245
All right.
He can fight my robot Metro.

59:00.412 --> 59:02.121
I'll give you a 100 bucks
for one two-minute round.

59:02.289 --> 59:03.540
- Take it.
- Three hundred.

59:03.707 --> 59:08.086
One hundred. Baby boy, I'm going to
give you $100 just to get in with Metro.

59:08.254 --> 59:09.921
How about 500 for two rounds?

59:10.547 --> 59:12.257
Two rounds.

59:12.424 --> 59:14.592
Two rounds, son, he ain't
going to survive one round.

59:14.760 --> 59:17.262
- What if he does?
- He ain't.

59:17.429 --> 59:19.931
Let's just say he does.

59:21.892 --> 59:25.144
If he's still
standing after one round...

59:26.355 --> 59:29.023
- ...I'll give you 1,000 bucks. Shut it!
- A 1,000...

59:33.112 --> 59:34.612
But if he dies in there,

59:34.780 --> 59:36.447
which he will, junior...

59:38.367 --> 59:40.702
...I get to keep what's left.

59:42.413 --> 59:43.705
Take the 100.

59:44.373 --> 59:46.165
Deal.

59:46.333 --> 59:49.002
We're on. We on!

59:51.714 --> 59:53.631
Let's go!

59:53.799 --> 59:54.757
You should have taken the 100.

59:54.925 --> 59:57.343
- I got us a thousand.
- Yeah, if he wins.

01:00:23.037 --> 01:00:24.579
You want me to drive?

01:00:24.747 --> 01:00:26.289
He's my bot. I got this!

01:00:26.457 --> 01:00:29.625
This ain't a video game, kid.
This is for real. Right here.

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:32.962
You said he's coming home in pieces.
What difference does it make?

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:34.297
All right.

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:37.383
I got this.

01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:39.761
Let's get it on!
Let's get it on!

01:00:39.928 --> 01:00:43.598
Let's get it on
like Ping-Pong in Hong Kong!

01:00:43.766 --> 01:00:46.434
Give me a bell! Give me a bell!

01:00:58.447 --> 01:01:00.740
Don't watch Atom.
Watch your opponent. Watch him.

01:01:00.908 --> 01:01:03.242
Watch out for that foot.
He's looking to pin you.

01:01:04.703 --> 01:01:07.205
I told you to watch for that foot plant.
Come on.

01:01:09.041 --> 01:01:10.666
Here comes the sledgehammer.

01:01:15.756 --> 01:01:17.757
Did you see that?

01:01:17.925 --> 01:01:20.259
- Come on! Get him!
- Don't yell at him, control him.

01:01:20.427 --> 01:01:22.428
Slip right. Back step.

01:01:23.138 --> 01:01:25.348
Duck. You're welcome.

01:01:25.516 --> 01:01:27.809
- Shut up! You're not helping!
- Actually, I think I am.

01:01:27.976 --> 01:01:29.268
No, no, no, no, no.

01:01:29.436 --> 01:01:32.188
Backhand. You got speed on this guy.

01:01:32.356 --> 01:01:34.107
Just keep moving. Bob.

01:01:34.274 --> 01:01:35.316
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:42.782
Slip out of that corner.
Keep moving! Bob and weave!

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:46.953
That's it! Now you're listening to me.

01:01:56.713 --> 01:02:00.216
He can take a hit. I'll give you this,
kid. Your bot can take a hit.

01:02:02.803 --> 01:02:05.304
You better slip that headlock 'cause
this ain't gonna end well for you.

01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:06.472
I'm trying!

01:02:13.105 --> 01:02:15.273
Thirty seconds!

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:19.318
Thirty se... Half a minute.

01:02:19.486 --> 01:02:22.113
Half a minute!
Keep moving! Just move!

01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:27.577
C'mon, you've got 20 seconds!

01:02:28.328 --> 01:02:30.997
That's a thousand bucks. Twenty
seconds. Let me... Let me take over!

01:02:31.165 --> 01:02:32.874
- No...
- Just move, then. Move!

01:02:40.007 --> 01:02:41.257
Come on.

01:02:41.425 --> 01:02:43.468
Get up, Atom. Get up, Atom.

01:02:45.596 --> 01:02:47.763
Count with me! Count with me!
One!

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:48.890
Get up, Atom!

01:02:49.057 --> 01:02:51.142
He can't hear you... You know you're
talking to a machine?

01:02:51.310 --> 01:02:53.728
Four! Five! Six!

01:02:53.896 --> 01:02:55.438
Get up, Atom!

01:02:55.606 --> 01:02:57.857
All the way up! All the way up!

01:02:58.025 --> 01:03:00.443
- No!
- Yeah!

01:03:00.611 --> 01:03:02.570
Yes! Yes!

01:03:07.034 --> 01:03:08.826
I'm going to fix it!
I'm going to fix it!

01:03:10.662 --> 01:03:12.788
I'm going to fix it! Come on, now.

01:03:12.956 --> 01:03:14.582
- This 1,000 bucks...
- Yeah, 1,000.

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:16.584
...double or nothing
he can't make another round.

01:03:16.752 --> 01:03:18.294
- Yeah, thanks anyway.
- Deal. Double or nothing.

01:03:18.462 --> 01:03:20.671
Baby boy said it!
We're back on! We on!

01:03:20.839 --> 01:03:23.174
Are you crazy?
You threw away a 1,000 bucks!

01:03:23.342 --> 01:03:25.384
He can barely stand up in there.

01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:28.012
Look, I really need the money.

01:03:29.056 --> 01:03:31.516
I know. Let's work.

01:03:33.185 --> 01:03:34.268
Ah, Jesus.

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:41.984
- Watch that. Watch that.
- I got that.

01:03:47.032 --> 01:03:49.075
Huh?

01:03:49.243 --> 01:03:51.452
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Yeah!

01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:58.376
- I got it.
- That's a system failure!

01:03:59.378 --> 01:04:01.045
- I don't got it.
- He's going down.

01:04:05.092 --> 01:04:07.843
- Yes!
- No!

01:04:08.428 --> 01:04:10.805
Start... Hey, hey! Start the count!

01:04:11.723 --> 01:04:12.807
Start the count!

01:04:12.975 --> 01:04:15.893
One! Two! Three!

01:04:16.061 --> 01:04:20.648
Four! Five! Six! Seven!

01:04:20.816 --> 01:04:22.775
Eight! Nine!

01:04:22.943 --> 01:04:24.443
Ten!

01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:27.905
You did it! We did it! Wow!

01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:33.536
Yeah!

01:04:33.704 --> 01:04:36.289
Time to go. Come on. Grab your robot.

01:04:37.082 --> 01:04:40.876
I know, I know!
I know! I know!

01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:42.795
Kingpin, pay up.

01:04:42.963 --> 01:04:46.007
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know, I know, I know.

01:04:46.174 --> 01:04:49.760
- We owned!
- Let's go. Come on, come on.

01:04:49.928 --> 01:04:51.679
- Yeah?
- Have I got a fight for you.

01:04:51.847 --> 01:04:54.557
Saturday night.
Guaranteed four grand.

01:04:54.725 --> 01:04:56.058
Seven if he wins.

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:58.352
Four grand?
You're on. Let's go!

01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:11.616
Bailey, it's me. He won.

01:05:11.783 --> 01:05:14.035
Can you believe that?
The kid's robot actually won.

01:05:16.163 --> 01:05:17.246
I know.

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:22.043
Oh, yeah, oh, happy?
Oh, my God. Yeah.

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:24.629
He's been bit.
He's been bit real bad.

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:29.425
Yeah. Anyway, I...

01:05:31.762 --> 01:05:33.471
...I just wanted you to know.

01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:05.294
Jab.

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:14.178
Jab, jab, hook.

01:06:17.516 --> 01:06:19.183
I think you have to move your feet.

01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:25.898
Your feet. Feet.

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:46.979
Nice moves, kid.

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:50.608
How long you been out here?

01:07:51.610 --> 01:07:53.235
- Check it out.
- What?

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:55.529
I just spent the night doing
something I think is amazing.

01:07:55.697 --> 01:07:58.282
Incredibly amazing.
If it works, you know?

01:07:58.450 --> 01:08:00.618
- You know his remote was spotty?
- Yeah.

01:08:00.786 --> 01:08:01.952
I killed it.

01:08:02.329 --> 01:08:04.747
- Got rid of it. We don't need it anymore.
- How did you...

01:08:05.999 --> 01:08:07.750
I had to start over.

01:08:07.918 --> 01:08:10.503
But I was able
to use the spin frame from Ambush...

01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:14.298
...and take the circuitry sleeve
out of Noisy Boy and it works.

01:08:14.466 --> 01:08:17.676
He knows nothing, but it works.
It really, really works.

01:08:17.844 --> 01:08:18.928
What works?

01:08:20.471 --> 01:08:21.680
I got to turn it on.

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:25.935
Left jab, right uppercut!

01:08:28.063 --> 01:08:29.188
Japan!

01:08:29.356 --> 01:08:31.857
You put Noisy's voice
recognition into Atom?

01:08:32.024 --> 01:08:35.611
- Pretty smart, kid.
- Smart? It could be genius!

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:38.322
It could be the most incredible thing
in the history of the entire world!

01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:40.407
Easy there, chief, easy. Whoa! Whoa!

01:08:40.575 --> 01:08:43.035
- Did you drink all these sodas?
- I might have had a few.

01:08:43.203 --> 01:08:46.037
- I need you to teach him to box.
- Are you kidding me?

01:08:46.206 --> 01:08:48.916
He's nowhere near advanced enough
to handle Noisy's voice command.

01:08:49.084 --> 01:08:51.085
So he needs your moves.
Your commands.

01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:53.837
- Start over from the ground up.
- Forget it, kid. Forget it.

01:08:54.005 --> 01:08:57.508
You were a boxer, Charlie.
Yesterday at the Zoo,

01:08:57.676 --> 01:09:00.219
you could see things happen
before they even happened.

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:02.720
I haven't boxed in a long time.
I'm not starting now.

01:09:02.889 --> 01:09:04.430
Who's going to teach him to fight?

01:09:04.599 --> 01:09:07.350
You're doing fine, Max.
You don't need me. Sorry.

01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:13.607
That was really cool,
though, that dance.

01:09:13.774 --> 01:09:16.734
You should do that on Saturday night.

01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:19.779
- Don't make fun of me.
- I'm serious.

01:09:19.948 --> 01:09:22.575
Before the fight, when you guys
take the ring, you should do it.

01:09:22.742 --> 01:09:25.953
There's no way I'm dancing with a robot
in front of a boxing crowd.

01:09:26.121 --> 01:09:29.497
A box... Are you kidding me?
This is just a show.

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:31.709
People want to see something
they've never seen.

01:09:31.877 --> 01:09:34.587
Look. You think of all the greats.

01:09:34.754 --> 01:09:37.256
Think Ali, Sugar Ray,
Prince Rakim, Gammer,

01:09:37.424 --> 01:09:39.341
they all had their nicknames.

01:09:39.509 --> 01:09:42.511
They had their personas.
They all had flair.

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:44.930
Now you? You might
not have much robot,

01:09:45.098 --> 01:09:47.140
but with that dance,
you got flair.

01:09:47.309 --> 01:09:50.603
Plus, you're a kid.
People love that kid thing.

01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:53.397
- What are you? Like nine? Ten?
- I'm 11.

01:09:53.564 --> 01:09:55.691
OK. Are you sure you're 11?

01:09:55.859 --> 01:09:58.611
Yes. I'm sure I'm 11.

01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:03.032
Anyway, the point
is people want to see that.

01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:08.537
You're really not messing with me?

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:11.081
I am not messing with you.
They're going to love it.

01:10:14.336 --> 01:10:15.502
- OK.
- Cool.

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:16.921
- But...
- What?

01:10:17.088 --> 01:10:19.590
I won't do it unless you help me.

01:10:21.593 --> 01:10:23.052
I can't dance.
You're on your own there.

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:25.220
No. Boxing.

01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:26.722
- Oh, I see.
- I program the robot.

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:29.058
- You teach him to box.
- And you dance.

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:30.559
And you dance.

01:10:32.896 --> 01:10:34.104
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:10:34.272 --> 01:10:37.191
Deal.

01:10:37.359 --> 01:10:38.442
Deal.

01:10:39.611 --> 01:10:41.487
All right.

01:10:41.655 --> 01:10:42.988
It's going to be cool.

01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:38.877
Nice.

01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:42.381
You're going
to be punching guys bigger.

01:11:42.549 --> 01:11:44.508
You're going to have to punch up.

01:11:44.676 --> 01:11:45.759
That's it.

01:11:46.845 --> 01:11:47.845
Nice.

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.853
You, too, old man?

01:11:56.021 --> 01:11:57.896
Come on. Let's get to work.

01:12:00.567 --> 01:12:02.735
Nice! Let's do that again.

01:12:04.529 --> 01:12:06.572
Nice. Three-punch combo.

01:12:07.782 --> 01:12:09.116
Combo.

01:12:10.118 --> 01:12:11.869
Again. Again.

01:12:12.996 --> 01:12:16.415
Faster. Faster. Nice.

01:12:18.084 --> 01:12:20.753
You're not even out of breath.
I like it.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.254
Let's see how you move.

01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:30.345
That's good.

01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:08.717
Step around.
Left hook. Left hook.

01:13:25.318 --> 01:13:26.985
That's it. Every time.

01:13:45.046 --> 01:13:46.380
Great fight, fellas.

01:13:54.305 --> 01:13:57.891
<i>105.5, W-R-U-T,</i>
<i>the satellite home of robot boxing.</i>

01:13:58.059 --> 01:13:59.601
<i>Caller two, what do you got for me?</i>

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:02.146
<i>Have you heard about this</i>
<i>little bot out there, his name is Atom?</i>

01:14:02.313 --> 01:14:03.522
<i>Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.</i>

01:14:03.690 --> 01:14:05.899
<i>My buddies and I saw him</i>
<i>the other night, and he dances.</i>

01:14:06.067 --> 01:14:07.943
- <i>Did you say "dances"?</i>
- <i>You heard me.</i>

01:14:08.111 --> 01:14:09.862
<i>He dances pre-fight</i>
<i>with this little kid,</i>

01:14:10.029 --> 01:14:11.905
<i>and the crowd</i>
<i>went nuts for these two.</i>

01:14:12.073 --> 01:14:13.323
<i>I'll tell you what's</i>
<i>really something,</i>

01:14:13.491 --> 01:14:14.741

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.872
<i>Chaos. Wall Street.</i>

01:14:20.039 --> 01:14:21.790
<i>No slouches on that list, right?</i>

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:24.126
<i>But folks,</i>
<i>Atom's fought them all, beat them all.</i>

01:14:24.294 --> 01:14:26.378
<i>I'm telling you, Tommy,</i>
<i>this bot is fast!</i>

01:14:26.546 --> 01:14:28.714
<i>He escapes shots from</i>
<i>these bigger bots, it's insane!</i>

01:14:28.882 --> 01:14:30.465
<i>No doubt, no doubt.</i>
<i>I'm telling you, listeners,</i>

01:14:30.633 --> 01:14:33.886
<i>you remember this name:</i>
<i>Atom. That's right, A-T-O-M.</i>

01:14:34.053 --> 01:14:35.095
Atom!

01:14:35.263 --> 01:14:36.930
<i>This bot is one to watch.</i>

01:14:41.853 --> 01:14:44.188
- Awesome fight, sir.
- Thanks, thanks.

01:14:44.355 --> 01:14:46.356
Great fight, guys.

01:14:46.524 --> 01:14:47.858
- Kenton, you guys put on a good show.
- Thanks.

01:14:48.026 --> 01:14:49.902
Good enough, we'd like to invite you
to fight on our card,

01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:51.862
Virgin America Spectrum Detroit,
Friday night.

01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:55.616
Right. Whoa.
That's a WRB... That's a League fight.

01:14:55.783 --> 01:14:58.202
Damn right it is.
What do you say, fellas?

01:14:58.369 --> 01:14:59.828
You ready for the show?

01:15:01.539 --> 01:15:02.706
Heck, yeah.

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:15.302
It's the undercard,
but it's still a League fight.

01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:18.513
I just want you to be relaxed.
I want you to be relaxed, OK, Max.

01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:20.057
No freaking out.

01:15:20.225 --> 01:15:21.600
Don't get all freaky-deaky on me.

01:15:21.768 --> 01:15:24.102
You go freaky-deaky,
this whole thing can go south.

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:26.271
Whatever you do, have fun, have fun.

01:15:26.439 --> 01:15:27.856
You got to have fun,
you understand me?

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:30.025
We've come too far to get out there

01:15:30.193 --> 01:15:31.985
and freak out
and blow this whole thing.

01:15:32.153 --> 01:15:35.530
We're going to have fun, and we gonna...
we're gonna not freak out!

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:39.076
We're going to stay loose,
and we're just going to bam him.

01:15:39.244 --> 01:15:42.788
I tell ya, man, I've spent my whole life
waiting to get here. We're going to...

01:15:43.581 --> 01:15:47.751
Because, I tell ya what... Trust me when
I say no freaking out. You got it?

01:15:47.919 --> 01:15:50.420
- Yeah, I got it.
- Good.

01:15:50.588 --> 01:15:55.759
You have been invited to Lemkova Suite.
Follow me, please.

01:15:55.927 --> 01:15:57.427
What was that? One more time.

01:15:57.595 --> 01:16:00.013
Lemkova Suite. Zeus Suite.

01:16:00.181 --> 01:16:04.393
Sure. Yeah. Let's head
up to the champ's suite. Sure.

01:16:33.381 --> 01:16:34.506
Wow.

01:16:34.674 --> 01:16:36.466
Gentlemen, I'm Farra Lemkova.

01:16:36.634 --> 01:16:38.593
Yeah. I'm Charlie Kenton and...

01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:40.721
And this, of course,
is Tak Mashido.

01:16:40.888 --> 01:16:44.057
Holy shit. It's Tak Mashido.

01:16:44.225 --> 01:16:46.351
I know you have
a very important fight tonight,

01:16:46.519 --> 01:16:47.644
so I'll get right to it.

01:16:47.812 --> 01:16:49.563
It's a little far
from the action for my liking.

01:16:49.731 --> 01:16:53.108
It's nice. I like it, though.
Very nicely...

01:16:53.276 --> 01:16:55.193
Wow, that is... That's a great shot.

01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:57.988
Look at that. You want an autograph?
Would you mind...

01:16:58.156 --> 01:16:59.614
I'd like to buy your robot.

01:17:01.826 --> 01:17:03.994
He'd be useful sparring bot for Zeus.

01:17:04.162 --> 01:17:06.163
And for that I'm willing to pay.

01:17:07.165 --> 01:17:10.208
$200,000.

01:17:10.376 --> 01:17:12.502
- Done.
- He's not for sale.

01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:15.255
- Of course he is. We can definitely...
- He's not for sale.

01:17:15.423 --> 01:17:17.382
You are 15 minutes away

01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:20.469
from getting in
the ring with Twin Cities,

01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:22.387
a vicious League bot.

01:17:22.555 --> 01:17:26.058
So, to be clear, my offer stands

01:17:26.225 --> 01:17:27.809
until the starting bell.

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:30.395
OK. And just to be clear,

01:17:30.563 --> 01:17:32.189
he's not for sale!

01:17:32.357 --> 01:17:34.858
Not now, not ever.

01:17:35.026 --> 01:17:37.819
Listen, give me
a minute to clear this up, OK?

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:40.822
Tak, how are you? Max!

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:45.577
Max. Max. Be smart.
I know you love him

01:17:45.745 --> 01:17:48.121
but in 20 minutes there
may be nothing left to love.

01:17:48.289 --> 01:17:50.457
Think about it.
Take the offer.

01:17:50.625 --> 01:17:52.918
You think about it.
Why does she want Atom?

01:17:53.086 --> 01:17:55.629
Huh? Because he's
different from other bots!

01:17:55.797 --> 01:17:57.422
Yeah, he's different.
He's smaller and weaker,

01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:58.673
and he's going
to get his ass kicked.

01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:03.261
He's a boxer. We taught him to box.
You taught him to box!

01:18:03.429 --> 01:18:05.389
- That's worth something.
- I think it is, too.

01:18:05.556 --> 01:18:08.809
I think it's worth 200 grand.
Two hundred grand.

01:18:08.976 --> 01:18:11.895
Charlie, we can go round and round
this all night long.

01:18:12.063 --> 01:18:13.522
Look at me, look at me.

01:18:14.816 --> 01:18:16.149
But it's not going to happen.

01:18:17.402 --> 01:18:18.735
I got a fight to get to.

01:18:33.334 --> 01:18:37.003
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight

01:18:37.171 --> 01:18:41.883
<i>the march towards</i>
<i>the Real Steel Championship</i>

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:45.470
<i>makes its way through Detroit's</i>

01:18:45.638 --> 01:18:49.099
Virgin America Spectrum!

01:18:53.312 --> 01:18:57.732
Kicking off the evening,
in our first undercard,

01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:00.652
the two-headed tyrant,

01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:05.198
Twin Cities!

01:19:35.438 --> 01:19:40.859
Opposing Twin Cities,
in his first professional fight,

01:19:41.027 --> 01:19:44.362
hailing from parts unknown...

01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:46.364
...Atom!

01:20:41.921 --> 01:20:43.213
- Nice work, boss.
- Thanks.

01:20:43.381 --> 01:20:45.632
- Did you switch him to fight mode?
- Of course.

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.467
All right, now this bot
is tough to put down.

01:20:47.635 --> 01:20:48.593
Atom can do it.

01:20:48.761 --> 01:20:53.014
Max, look over there. You see those
geeks with the joysticks and consoles?

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:54.432
They're controlling everything
their bot does.

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.518
They're monitoring his systems,
seeing what he sees,

01:20:56.686 --> 01:20:58.103
stadium feeds of the fights, everything.

01:20:58.271 --> 01:21:00.272
This is not like the underground
handheld remote bots

01:21:00.439 --> 01:21:02.649
we've been fighting.
This is the League. Stand on that.

01:21:02.817 --> 01:21:04.359
So what do we do?

01:21:05.111 --> 01:21:08.613
We fight smart,
we be patient. And pray.

01:21:10.116 --> 01:21:11.866
Seriously, pray.

01:21:13.452 --> 01:21:15.161
Ready!

01:21:16.706 --> 01:21:18.498
- Ready!
- Hands up.

01:21:18.666 --> 01:21:20.917
Fighters ready! Fight!

01:21:24.755 --> 01:21:26.673
Engage.

01:21:26.841 --> 01:21:28.425
Slip! Right!

01:21:28.593 --> 01:21:30.927
Lean back. Right, left!

01:21:31.095 --> 01:21:32.304
Cover up!

01:21:35.474 --> 01:21:36.808
Duck! Left roundhouse!

01:21:39.562 --> 01:21:40.562
Damn it.

01:21:48.446 --> 01:21:50.280
Lean left! Lean right!

01:21:50.448 --> 01:21:51.990
Cover up! Cover up!

01:21:52.158 --> 01:21:53.158
What's going on in there?

01:21:53.326 --> 01:21:55.160
Too many hits.
He's taking too many hits.

01:22:01.042 --> 01:22:02.334
Get your hands up!

01:22:05.171 --> 01:22:07.005
Get out of that corner! Move!

01:22:10.051 --> 01:22:12.594
Come on, Charlie. He's getting killed
in there! Tell him what to do!

01:22:12.762 --> 01:22:15.472
That guy's got two heads, and about a
foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:17.432
He's got to have a weakness. Find it!

01:22:23.356 --> 01:22:24.689
Wait, wait, wait.

01:22:25.399 --> 01:22:28.151
Right shoulder, right shoulder,
right shoulder! He's got a tell!

01:22:28.319 --> 01:22:30.820
He's got a hitch in his shoulder
every time he throws that right bomb!

01:22:30.988 --> 01:22:33.114
- So?
- We got him! See? Here it comes again!

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:35.950
Duck! Spin! Slide left!
Roundhouse! One, two!

01:22:36.118 --> 01:22:39.371
Backstep. Backstep.
Backstep. Lean right.

01:22:39.538 --> 01:22:41.539
Come on, Charlie! Get in there!

01:22:41.707 --> 01:22:44.167
Got to get in close where he can't use
that size and reach on us!

01:22:44.335 --> 01:22:47.504
Left to the body! Right to the body!
Left to the body!

01:22:47.672 --> 01:22:49.005
Yeah, it's working!

01:22:49.173 --> 01:22:51.091
Stay downstairs! Left, right, left!

01:22:52.593 --> 01:22:53.843
These program modes aren't working.

01:22:54.011 --> 01:22:55.261
Left! Right hook, slip!

01:22:55.429 --> 01:22:57.305
Right uppercut! Left uppercut!

01:22:57.473 --> 01:22:59.099
Duck left. Counter right!

01:22:59.266 --> 01:23:01.810
- Get him, Atom!
- Here comes the Charlie Special.

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:04.979
Three-punch combo
to the body! Out! In! Counter!

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:07.023
- Two-one-two.
- Two-one-two.

01:23:07.191 --> 01:23:08.608
Stay on him! Lunging right!

01:23:10.403 --> 01:23:11.403
No!

01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:14.072
Don't let him go. Right to the body!
Straight right to the head!

01:23:19.203 --> 01:23:22.163
- That's it, we got a systems crash!
- Get him, Atom!

01:23:24.542 --> 01:23:25.375
Damn it!

01:23:25.543 --> 01:23:26.751
This is not happening.
This is not happening, man.

01:23:26.919 --> 01:23:29.295
- Put him away, Charlie!
- Spin left!

01:23:30.297 --> 01:23:31.631
Spin right!

01:23:33.843 --> 01:23:35.760
- Finish him!
- Do it!

01:23:35.928 --> 01:23:37.095
Right uppercut!

01:23:39.682 --> 01:23:40.974
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:23:41.142 --> 01:23:43.017
Yeah!

01:23:43.185 --> 01:23:45.895
Ah! Ah!

01:23:47.398 --> 01:23:48.481
He's down!

01:23:49.483 --> 01:23:52.694
One! Two! Three!

01:23:52.862 --> 01:23:55.363
Four! Five!

01:23:55.531 --> 01:23:57.949
- Six! Seven!
- We got him. Stay down!

01:23:59.076 --> 01:24:01.703
He's out! He's out!

01:24:01.871 --> 01:24:03.997
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:24:07.793 --> 01:24:08.835
Yeah!

01:24:11.839 --> 01:24:13.631
Corner!

01:24:13.799 --> 01:24:16.760
Corner! Corner!

01:24:18.387 --> 01:24:20.764
Victory!

01:24:20.931 --> 01:24:25.143
In a time
of one minute, 47 seconds

01:24:25.311 --> 01:24:29.397
of the first round,
Atom has defeat...

01:24:30.608 --> 01:24:33.318
I want to thank everyone
for coming out tonight!

01:24:35.863 --> 01:24:40.116
Our little bot from the junkyard
got a shot at a League fight.

01:24:40.284 --> 01:24:41.618
How about that?

01:24:42.912 --> 01:24:47.457
And the last thing I want to say
to a special girl who won't be named,

01:24:47.625 --> 01:24:50.585
Farra Lemkova.

01:24:53.255 --> 01:24:54.214
Whoa, OK, hang on.

01:24:54.381 --> 01:24:55.799
That instead of buying my robot,

01:24:55.966 --> 01:24:57.550
and using your
money to control this sport...

01:24:57.718 --> 01:24:59.427
- That's it!
- Wait, I'm not done.

01:24:59.595 --> 01:25:02.680
Why not give
the littlest guy the biggest shot?

01:25:02.848 --> 01:25:06.643
Seriously, because I bet if you give him
a shot, he'll surprise you!

01:25:06.811 --> 01:25:08.728
Wouldn't you
like to see a little guy get a shot

01:25:08.896 --> 01:25:12.857
at the Real Steel Championship?

01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:18.154
I challenge Zeus to a fight.

01:25:19.782 --> 01:25:24.160
Any time, any place, anywhere!

01:25:24.328 --> 01:25:26.663
You name it! We will be there!

01:25:26.831 --> 01:25:28.581
Yeah! OK!

01:25:35.047 --> 01:25:36.965
I'm going to get us that fight!

01:25:41.762 --> 01:25:43.888
Atom, Atom, Atom...

01:25:56.819 --> 01:25:59.070
That was a ballsy move,
you challenging Zeus like that.

01:25:59.238 --> 01:26:00.738
That's one thing to call it.

01:26:00.906 --> 01:26:02.407
I think a lot of people would
like to see that fight.

01:26:02.575 --> 01:26:05.285
- You're damn right they would.
- You listening to this kid? Jeez!

01:26:05.452 --> 01:26:07.161
- Good fight, fellas.
- Thanks, man.

01:26:07.329 --> 01:26:09.080
- Look at this. Let's celebrate.
- Yeah.

01:26:09.248 --> 01:26:12.417
- All right, 70-30, right?
- Yeah, 70 for me and 30 for you.

01:26:12.585 --> 01:26:14.544
- That's so right.
- That's very funny.

01:26:14.712 --> 01:26:16.921
I told you
we shouldn't have sold him.

01:26:17.089 --> 01:26:20.300
OK. No, no, no.
I remember now. Who's right?

01:26:20.467 --> 01:26:22.719
Say who's right. Say "Max is right."

01:26:22.887 --> 01:26:24.804
All right, all right. All right.

01:26:24.972 --> 01:26:28.349
- We're a good team.
- No, no. Max is right.

01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:31.102
That was unbelievable.
Thank you, Twin Cities.

01:26:33.063 --> 01:26:35.023
- Whoo! All right, we set?
- Yeah.

01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:38.192
- All right, let's do it.
- Charlie boy.

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:41.654
- Ricky, I was just going to call you.
- Oh, yeah.

01:26:41.822 --> 01:26:44.657
I actually really
was going to call you.

01:26:44.825 --> 01:26:46.451
Don't worry about that.

01:26:46.619 --> 01:26:48.536
That was a heck of a fight.

01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:51.080
Congratulations to both of you.
That was really good.

01:26:51.248 --> 01:26:54.208
It was an amazing fight.
That was a great job, young man.

01:26:55.210 --> 01:26:56.544
- Come on, man.
- What?

01:26:56.712 --> 01:27:00.757
- You serious?
- You thought I was joking

01:27:00.925 --> 01:27:02.592
when I said I'd beat you
within an inch of your life?

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:05.845
He thought that was a joke.
How about that? It wasn't a joke.

01:27:06.013 --> 01:27:10.183
I got a kid here. And I have your money.
We don't have a problem.

01:27:10.351 --> 01:27:12.977
I'm sure you do, Charlie, but...

01:27:13.145 --> 01:27:16.147
...but I think we know it's about
much more than money, don't we?

01:27:16.315 --> 01:27:18.441
All right. What do you want?

01:27:18.609 --> 01:27:21.611
You want 25, 30? You want 30 grand?

01:27:21.779 --> 01:27:23.321
- I got the money in cash here.
- Yeah, right.

01:27:23.489 --> 01:27:26.616
Let's go! Max, go! Go, go! Run!

01:27:26.784 --> 01:27:30.119
- Run! Come on. Keep up!
- Get him now!

01:27:30.287 --> 01:27:31.579
Run! Come on!

01:27:33.457 --> 01:27:35.208
Get off him! Get off him!

01:27:38.545 --> 01:27:39.545
Come here!

01:27:43.926 --> 01:27:45.093
Hey, Ricky.

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:46.761
That's his money! Leave him out of this!

01:27:48.806 --> 01:27:49.806
Hey!

01:27:59.191 --> 01:28:00.400
Stop!

01:28:03.570 --> 01:28:04.779
Stop!

01:28:04.947 --> 01:28:08.574
Take all his money. Take it all.

01:28:11.203 --> 01:28:13.538
Your friend's a real dirtbag, kid.

01:28:13.706 --> 01:28:15.373
He's my father!

01:28:17.584 --> 01:28:22.213
Well. Looks like a little less
than an inch of your life.

01:28:22.381 --> 01:28:25.299
Well, buddy, that will teach him.

01:28:28.554 --> 01:28:30.722
Whoo!

01:28:30.889 --> 01:28:33.725
Just like old times, Charlie boy!

01:28:33.892 --> 01:28:35.226
Let's go, boys.

01:28:40.024 --> 01:28:41.983
Charlie.

01:29:01.128 --> 01:29:05.339
I'm sorry, Max.
I'm sorry. Sorry.

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:47.340
- What are we doing here?
- Max, just...

01:29:47.508 --> 01:29:49.801
Is it Farra?
She called you, didn't she?

01:29:49.968 --> 01:29:52.470
- We're going to get the Zeus fight.
- Listen, it's not the Zeus people.

01:29:52.638 --> 01:29:55.765
I've been thinking about
all this, and...

01:29:56.892 --> 01:29:57.892
Max!

01:29:58.852 --> 01:30:00.603
Max?

01:30:03.649 --> 01:30:05.316
Max.

01:30:07.569 --> 01:30:10.029
It's so good to see you.

01:30:10.197 --> 01:30:12.281
- What is she doing here?
- It's better if you go with her now.

01:30:12.449 --> 01:30:14.909
We get beat up,
so you call her to come and get me?

01:30:15.077 --> 01:30:16.786
He's been beat up.
I told you he couldn't take care of him!

01:30:16.954 --> 01:30:19.497
Yeah. I called her.
Look at us. We're a mess.

01:30:19.665 --> 01:30:21.707
We're fine. She can leave!

01:30:21.875 --> 01:30:24.877
Atom's fighting good.
We can make the money back.

01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:27.421
Charlie, please.

01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:29.590
Just...

01:30:32.594 --> 01:30:35.138
Charlie, we're doing so good.

01:30:37.099 --> 01:30:39.016
Charlie, please, no.

01:30:40.269 --> 01:30:43.354
Don't. Don't. Don't.

01:30:43.522 --> 01:30:46.899
Please. Please.

01:30:51.488 --> 01:30:54.532
Trust me, kid.
It's better this way, all right?

01:30:55.367 --> 01:30:57.952
I know you think you know what's right,
but you don't.

01:30:58.120 --> 01:30:59.954
You're too young.
You don't know.

01:31:00.122 --> 01:31:01.539
Look at me, trust me.

01:31:01.707 --> 01:31:05.084
And legally she has custody,
so what can I do?

01:31:06.170 --> 01:31:07.837
You tell me, what can I do?

01:31:12.509 --> 01:31:14.260
Max!

01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:25.688
I don't want your money, Marvin.

01:31:25.856 --> 01:31:27.940
Max, we have our
own swimming pool

01:31:28.108 --> 01:31:32.862
and we have a hot tub and a lot
of super fun toys to play with.

01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:35.531
Do you want to play with them?
It's going to be fun.

01:31:36.450 --> 01:31:37.909
What's going on?

01:31:38.076 --> 01:31:41.495
He won't even talk to me,
so thanks for that, Charlie.

01:31:41.663 --> 01:31:43.247
I'm going to wait in the car.

01:31:45.876 --> 01:31:48.336
You don't want to talk, fine. I'll talk.

01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:50.379
What do you want me to say? I'm sorry?

01:31:50.547 --> 01:31:55.593
You knew from day one what this was.
You decided to take the ride.

01:31:56.261 --> 01:32:00.389
I mean, what? Max, you thought me, you,
and a little robot from the junk heap

01:32:00.557 --> 01:32:03.726
were going to
ride off into the sunset? Come on.

01:32:04.895 --> 01:32:07.188
No, you forgot who I was!

01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:14.737
You deserve better...

01:32:16.198 --> 01:32:17.365
...than me.

01:32:21.495 --> 01:32:23.537
Will you say something, please?

01:32:23.705 --> 01:32:26.165
I tried, OK. What do you want from me?

01:32:26.333 --> 01:32:28.042
I want you to fight for me.

01:32:29.294 --> 01:32:31.087
That's all I ever wanted.

01:34:36.463 --> 01:34:37.797
No, don't ask.

01:34:39.299 --> 01:34:41.509
So no Max.

01:34:42.761 --> 01:34:46.388
It's better this way. Marv and Debra
have money. Max is set.

01:34:46.556 --> 01:34:49.475
Did you not see
the way he looked at you?

01:34:49.643 --> 01:34:51.769
Charlie, that's the way
I looked at my dad.

01:34:51.937 --> 01:34:54.313
Even now I would give anything
to have that back.

01:34:54.481 --> 01:34:59.235
Your dad was special.
He was in your corner from day one.

01:34:59.402 --> 01:35:00.986
Me, come on. I blew it.

01:35:02.989 --> 01:35:04.448
I blew it.

01:35:05.575 --> 01:35:07.201
When Max was born I just...

01:35:07.369 --> 01:35:09.203
...freaked out.

01:35:09.371 --> 01:35:11.622
But something
would have been better than nothing.

01:35:11.790 --> 01:35:12.915
I just wouldn't know where to start.

01:35:13.083 --> 01:35:14.250
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't.

01:35:14.417 --> 01:35:15.751
- You do.
- No.

01:35:16.586 --> 01:35:17.878
You do.

01:35:50.871 --> 01:35:52.079
I got to go.

01:35:55.041 --> 01:35:56.709
Twelve-hundred miles for a kiss.

01:35:58.128 --> 01:36:00.504
Worth it. Worth it.

01:36:11.808 --> 01:36:13.517
Go get him, Charlie.

01:36:16.897 --> 01:36:18.314
You sound like your dad.

01:36:40.462 --> 01:36:42.338
Hey.

01:36:46.426 --> 01:36:50.429
OK. Uh, look,
I know you think I abandoned you

01:36:50.597 --> 01:36:53.432
and I guess I did originally.

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:56.352
- Then you sold me.
- Charlie.

01:36:56.519 --> 01:36:59.396
- Hey.
- You have no business being here.

01:36:59.564 --> 01:37:01.982
That's true.
You've got full custody. He's yours.

01:37:02.150 --> 01:37:04.610
And I know I've done
all kinds of wrong by this kid,

01:37:04.778 --> 01:37:06.946
but if you'll let me...

01:37:08.198 --> 01:37:10.324
...I'd just like to
do one thing right.

01:37:13.161 --> 01:37:14.245
Right.

01:37:15.872 --> 01:37:17.623
- Now, where were we?
- You sold me.

01:37:17.791 --> 01:37:21.085
- Right, yeah, that happened.
- Wait, what?

01:37:21.253 --> 01:37:23.921
- Then we had our asses kicked.
- And you slept on a shelf in a truck,

01:37:24.089 --> 01:37:25.381
- and it was awful.
- And dangerous.

01:37:25.715 --> 01:37:30.469
Really dangerous. I mean, I know.
God. I'm sorry.

01:37:31.471 --> 01:37:34.431
That's why you came?
To say you're sorry?

01:37:34.599 --> 01:37:36.934
No. I mean yes. Yes.

01:37:39.854 --> 01:37:41.355
But no.

01:37:41.523 --> 01:37:44.358
No, I came to
tell you that I heard you.

01:37:44.526 --> 01:37:48.737
I got it.
I'm a little slow, but I got it.

01:37:48.905 --> 01:37:53.033
I know you had a bum ride, Max, and I
wasn't there and I should have been.

01:37:54.244 --> 01:37:55.452
I should have been.

01:37:56.579 --> 01:37:58.956
Your mom was...

01:37:59.124 --> 01:38:00.374
She was cool, wasn't she?

01:38:01.918 --> 01:38:03.544
She was.

01:38:03.712 --> 01:38:05.754
She was the coolest.

01:38:05.922 --> 01:38:08.465
Yeah, she was.

01:38:11.636 --> 01:38:13.637
And I'm sorry about...

01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:17.558
...what happened with her.

01:38:19.644 --> 01:38:24.189
And I can't get those years back,
Max, but...

01:38:24.357 --> 01:38:26.984
...but I'm here right now...

01:38:27.152 --> 01:38:30.738
...and if you're up for it,
I'm ready to fight.

01:38:44.461 --> 01:38:46.211
We got the Zeus fight.

01:38:46.588 --> 01:38:47.588
What?

01:38:48.173 --> 01:38:50.174
No, no, we didn't.

01:38:50.342 --> 01:38:52.968
You got the Zeus fight.

01:38:56.473 --> 01:38:59.725
So what do you say, Debra?
Can we do this one last thing?

01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:04.396
One night.

01:39:04.564 --> 01:39:06.023
One night.
It's all we need. Thank you.

01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:14.740
We'll probably get our asses kicked,
but at least we'll go down swinging.

01:39:14.908 --> 01:39:16.116
Yeah?

01:39:16.284 --> 01:39:17.951
What do you say?

01:39:19.913 --> 01:39:21.997
<i>Welcome, everyone,</i>
<i>to New York's Bing Arena</i>

01:39:22.165 --> 01:39:24.458
<i>and the Real Steel Championship Bout.</i>

01:39:24.626 --> 01:39:26.960
<i>Well, Tim, it's the fight</i>
<i>we never thought we'd see.</i>

01:39:27.128 --> 01:39:29.338
<i>Zeus, the undefeated WRB champion</i>

01:39:29.506 --> 01:39:32.800
<i>against the underdog, rising star Atom.</i>

01:39:32.967 --> 01:39:34.885
<i>The champ's handlers</i>
<i>have agreed to fight</i>

01:39:35.053 --> 01:39:37.513
<i>outside the circle</i>
<i>of well-known League bots</i>

01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:41.683
<i>and have decided to give the people</i>
<i>a true David versus Goliath spectacle.</i>

01:39:41.851 --> 01:39:45.354
Now, Tim, help me out on this.
Has the Zeus camp lost their mind?

01:39:45.522 --> 01:39:48.107
The greatest robot boxer of all time
gives a shot at the belt

01:39:48.274 --> 01:39:50.317
to a G-2 named Atom?

01:39:50.485 --> 01:39:54.238
Well, Herb, if you ask Tak Mashido,
Team Zeus has lost their minds.

01:39:54.406 --> 01:39:56.657
Now, he may look cool
as he enters the arena

01:39:56.825 --> 01:39:59.827
but he has made no bones about
his disdain for this matchup.

01:39:59.994 --> 01:40:02.788
Our cameras tried to catch up
with him earlier this week.

01:40:02.956 --> 01:40:05.707
Take a look at this clip. Mashido
wouldn't even stop to talk to the press,

01:40:05.875 --> 01:40:09.336
<i>referring only to this fight</i>
<i>as an insult to his creation.</i>

01:40:09.504 --> 01:40:11.588
Now, in truth, Herb, Max Kenton,
Atom's trainer,

01:40:11.756 --> 01:40:13.173
did more
than just challenge Zeus.

01:40:13.341 --> 01:40:14.758
He did so publicly.

01:40:14.926 --> 01:40:18.345
The challenge went viral and
created a PR nightmare for the champ.

01:40:18.513 --> 01:40:20.722
No argument there, Tim.
And I think the Zeus camp

01:40:20.890 --> 01:40:23.851
- knows exactly what they're doing.
- That they do. I mean, come on.

01:40:24.018 --> 01:40:26.937
Giving a shot at the belt
to a nobody from nowhere.

01:40:27.105 --> 01:40:30.274
This "junkyard dog," if you will.
That's a marketing stunt.

01:40:30.442 --> 01:40:33.110
And, hey, judging from this crowd,
that stunt is working.

01:40:47.709 --> 01:40:49.126
We can't win, can we?

01:40:50.211 --> 01:40:51.295
We'll see.

01:40:55.383 --> 01:40:57.759
As the challenger
makes his way into the arena,

01:40:57.927 --> 01:40:59.887
you can hear
the surge of excitement, Herb.

01:41:11.816 --> 01:41:14.943
Atom has arrived onto
the WRB scene with a vengeance,

01:41:15.111 --> 01:41:17.821
using a style,
some would call it human-like,

01:41:17.989 --> 01:41:20.407
that bot fighting has rarely seen.

01:41:20.575 --> 01:41:22.826
Atom and his pint-size trainer
step into the ring

01:41:22.994 --> 01:41:25.829
and the look on Farra Lemkova's face
says it all.

01:41:25.997 --> 01:41:27.789
Welcome to the bigs, junior!

01:41:27.957 --> 01:41:30.918
I'm giving 1-to-5 odds that Atom
don't make it out the first round.

01:41:31.085 --> 01:41:33.086
Now who wants some?

01:41:33.254 --> 01:41:34.588
I'll take some of that action.

01:41:34.756 --> 01:41:38.926
Hey, there!
I'll take some of that action.

01:41:39.093 --> 01:41:42.221
How's it going... partner?

01:41:42.388 --> 01:41:44.348
Partner?

01:41:44.516 --> 01:41:47.434
That's great. How about a
hundred K deep? Is that funny?

01:41:47.602 --> 01:41:50.437
Hundred K says Atom
doesn't see round two.

01:41:50.605 --> 01:41:52.356
You carrying
around that kind of scratch?

01:41:53.525 --> 01:41:55.776
- Yeah.
- Hundred K?

01:41:56.611 --> 01:42:00.572
Tell you what.
Remember section 101, row C

01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:03.659
and you can bring me my money
right to my seat.

01:42:03.826 --> 01:42:06.995
101, row C? Hundred K?

01:42:07.997 --> 01:42:09.039
You heard me, homey.

01:42:09.207 --> 01:42:10.958
- Homey?
- Right?

01:42:11.125 --> 01:42:12.334
Homeboy!

01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:16.213
All right. Peace out, posse.

01:42:16.381 --> 01:42:17.589
Come on, sugar. Let's go.

01:42:41.531 --> 01:42:43.031
Never beaten.

01:42:43.199 --> 01:42:44.157
It's showtime!

01:42:44.325 --> 01:42:46.535
Never threatened.

01:42:46.703 --> 01:42:49.580
The king of the ring,

01:42:49.747 --> 01:42:52.958
the ruler of robots!

01:42:53.126 --> 01:42:58.422
Bow down to the mighty Zeus!

01:43:24.032 --> 01:43:25.240
Oh, shit!

01:43:31.789 --> 01:43:32.956
That was awesome.

01:43:39.631 --> 01:43:40.797
Come on, let's go.

01:43:47.221 --> 01:43:50.349
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:43:50.516 --> 01:43:53.393
in a bout scheduled for five rounds

01:43:53.561 --> 01:43:56.355
for the World Robot
Boxing Championship,

01:43:56.522 --> 01:44:00.400
in the corner to my right,
the challenger, Atom!

01:44:00.568 --> 01:44:01.652
Showboat!

01:44:06.407 --> 01:44:08.784
And in the corner to my left,

01:44:08.951 --> 01:44:12.079
the undeniable champion
of this universe

01:44:12.246 --> 01:44:15.540
and any other universe
known or unknown,

01:44:15.708 --> 01:44:20.128
the mighty Zeus!

01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:27.219
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

01:44:27.387 --> 01:44:28.720
are you ready

01:44:28.888 --> 01:44:34.142
for Real Steel!

01:44:36.813 --> 01:44:37.979
This is what it's all about!

01:44:38.147 --> 01:44:42.234
There's the starting bell
and we are underway.

01:44:42.402 --> 01:44:45.028
The bots
emerge from their corners.

01:44:45.196 --> 01:44:48.073
Zeus decks Atom,
and he is already down.

01:44:48.241 --> 01:44:50.325
On your feet!

01:44:50.493 --> 01:44:53.537
Looks like we are in
for another Zeus clinic.

01:44:54.789 --> 01:44:57.082
Referee Matt Geiger
coming in the ring to start the count.

01:44:58.084 --> 01:44:59.126
Get up!

01:44:59.293 --> 01:45:00.502
...two, three...

01:45:00.670 --> 01:45:04.214
Push up! Stand up!

01:45:04.382 --> 01:45:07.050
But look at this.
The little bot's back on his feet

01:45:07.218 --> 01:45:10.303
to get a second blistering attack
from Zeus!

01:45:10.471 --> 01:45:12.806
And Atom is down for the second
time in less than ten seconds.

01:45:12.974 --> 01:45:16.435
- He's too strong! He's too strong!
- That's my boy right there!

01:45:18.438 --> 01:45:19.980
Get up and get in the game!

01:45:20.148 --> 01:45:23.150
Come on!
No, please Atom, get up! Please!

01:45:23.317 --> 01:45:26.069
Get up! Get up! Get up!

01:45:27.238 --> 01:45:30.198
Once again,
the challenger finds his feet!

01:45:31.617 --> 01:45:32.951
Lean back! Lean back!

01:45:33.119 --> 01:45:35.078
Atom's getting pummeled
into the corner!

01:45:35.246 --> 01:45:37.497
- Get out of there, Atom!
- Move, Atom, move!

01:45:39.792 --> 01:45:41.835
A demolishing inside shot.

01:45:42.003 --> 01:45:43.211
Get your hands up!

01:45:45.214 --> 01:45:46.798
Hands up!

01:45:47.592 --> 01:45:49.092
Crush that little can!

01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:50.594
Get out of the corner!
Get out of the corner!

01:45:50.762 --> 01:45:52.929
Charlie Kenton desperately
trying to command his robot

01:45:53.097 --> 01:45:54.055
out of that suicide corner.

01:45:54.223 --> 01:45:55.557
Cover up!

01:45:58.436 --> 01:46:00.187
Get your feet under you!

01:46:01.773 --> 01:46:03.774
Good night, sparring bot!

01:46:03.941 --> 01:46:06.485
It might have taken Zeus a bit longer,
but he's done it again!

01:46:06.652 --> 01:46:10.071
Atom is down for the third
and possibly final time tonight.

01:46:10.239 --> 01:46:12.407
- Stand up!
- Two!

01:46:12.575 --> 01:46:15.368
- Three!
- C'mon, Atom, get up!

01:46:15.536 --> 01:46:17.704
- Get up, Atom.
- Get up, Atom.

01:46:17.872 --> 01:46:21.041
- Six! Seven!
- Get up!

01:46:21.209 --> 01:46:23.752
Eight! Nine!

01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:26.630
I don't believe this!
Against all odds,

01:46:26.798 --> 01:46:28.632
this little bot is on his feet again.

01:46:29.801 --> 01:46:30.842
Come on, Atom!

01:46:34.055 --> 01:46:35.222
He can't survive this!

01:46:39.018 --> 01:46:41.269
- Come on, Charlie!
- Right uppercut!

01:46:42.563 --> 01:46:45.315
Atom has landed a punch!

01:46:45.483 --> 01:46:48.151
Zeus is stunned as he reels back
from an uppercut

01:46:48.319 --> 01:46:51.321
- that he clearly never saw coming!
- Advance!

01:46:52.198 --> 01:46:56.243
Fade back, counter right!

01:46:56.410 --> 01:46:58.703
Right cross! Right cross!

01:46:58.871 --> 01:46:59.621
Right cross!

01:46:59.956 --> 01:47:00.747
Left hook!

01:47:00.915 --> 01:47:03.792
- Let's go! Come on!
- Take him down!

01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:04.834
Double right to the body!

01:47:05.002 --> 01:47:06.711
For the first time
in his dominant run,

01:47:06.879 --> 01:47:10.423
Zeus has met a bot who simply
won't back down!

01:47:12.385 --> 01:47:15.095
The crowd is going nuts!
Zeus gives it everything he's got

01:47:15.263 --> 01:47:18.014
as we reach the last 15 seconds
of round one!

01:47:18.182 --> 01:47:22.352
Zeus corners Atom,
going double duty with both fists!

01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:25.438
Downtown, uptown,
as the clock winds down!

01:47:25.606 --> 01:47:28.650
- Hands up, chin down.
- Stay low, stay low!

01:47:32.321 --> 01:47:35.532
Only five seconds left,
as here comes that monster

01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:37.284
piston-packed right of the champ!

01:47:38.786 --> 01:47:42.872
There's the bell! I don't believe it.
Somehow Atom has survived.

01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:45.625
- He made it!
- We will have a second round.

01:47:45.793 --> 01:47:48.253
And the crowd here is thrilled!

01:47:51.382 --> 01:47:53.300
He made it!

01:47:53.467 --> 01:47:56.011
Yeah! Corner!

01:47:56.178 --> 01:47:57.721
We got to get out of here,
darling, come on.

01:47:57.888 --> 01:47:59.931
We got to get out of here right now!

01:48:02.685 --> 01:48:05.061
We got to go this way.
Come on!

01:48:10.568 --> 01:48:11.901
OK, you sit down.

01:48:15.197 --> 01:48:17.657
- Let's go, homey.
- All right.

01:48:17.825 --> 01:48:19.451
I'll be back for you, baby.

01:48:20.578 --> 01:48:22.495
Get your hands off me!

01:48:25.374 --> 01:48:27.917
Both corners furiously
working on their bots.

01:48:28.085 --> 01:48:31.296
I tell you, Tim, this crowd came here
tonight expecting a massacre

01:48:31.464 --> 01:48:33.590
but instead they're getting a war!

01:48:33.758 --> 01:48:35.133
- You got it?
- Yeah.

01:48:35.301 --> 01:48:38.553
- All right. Here we go.
- What is happening?

01:48:38.721 --> 01:48:41.931
He is fully prepared
for all possible contingencies.

01:48:42.099 --> 01:48:45.185
- He will be fine.
- What next?

01:48:46.103 --> 01:48:47.437
Round two.

01:48:55.029 --> 01:48:57.238
Round two kicks off,

01:48:57.406 --> 01:49:01.785
and incredibly the challenger, Atom,
is giving the champ a run for his money.

01:49:02.828 --> 01:49:06.539
Zeus tosses the smaller bot
across the ring like a tin can!

01:49:10.294 --> 01:49:12.545
Kenton working his bot
with a trifecta

01:49:12.713 --> 01:49:15.256
of straight rights
to the champ's dome!

01:49:20.346 --> 01:49:24.349
Toe-to-toe they stand,
trading deafening blows!

01:49:27.436 --> 01:49:31.106
Whatever strategy either corner
had cooked up has been destroyed!

01:49:33.943 --> 01:49:37.362
Metal bashing metal.
Steel smashing steel.

01:49:37.530 --> 01:49:40.365
This is a brawl!

01:49:42.493 --> 01:49:43.993
The crowd is on their feet,

01:49:44.161 --> 01:49:47.080
watching two machines
driven to kill each other!

01:49:47.248 --> 01:49:50.125
Something has to give,
and it does!

01:49:50.292 --> 01:49:52.043
Atom goes down again!

01:49:52.211 --> 01:49:54.212
Lights out
for the junkyard dog

01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:56.339
who put on a heck
of a show here tonight!

01:49:58.509 --> 01:50:01.052
And yet again,
Atom rises up.

01:50:01.220 --> 01:50:05.682
Kenton must have hardwired this bot
with the will to go on!

01:50:12.148 --> 01:50:17.026
Midway through round four, and Zeus is
looking to end this thing right now.

01:50:17.194 --> 01:50:18.903
The champ
is holding nothing back

01:50:19.071 --> 01:50:21.114
as he cracks open the hurt locker!

01:50:31.834 --> 01:50:33.585
Atom is
stumbling around the ring,

01:50:33.753 --> 01:50:35.545
apparently disoriented and dazed!

01:50:35.713 --> 01:50:37.213
- Hands up!
- What's going on?

01:50:37.381 --> 01:50:38.757
I think the voice recog is shot!

01:50:38.924 --> 01:50:40.091
- He's not responding!
- What?

01:50:43.429 --> 01:50:46.139
Zeus has found
yet another gear of violence,

01:50:46.307 --> 01:50:48.224
drilling Atom's midsection.

01:50:48.392 --> 01:50:52.645
- No! Stop! Do something!
- He can't hear me!

01:50:54.190 --> 01:50:56.274
But the bell sounds,
and once again,

01:50:56.442 --> 01:50:59.110
this little robot
has stunned the world!

01:51:01.447 --> 01:51:04.115
We're done, Max!
He can't hear me.

01:51:04.283 --> 01:51:06.409
This is murder.
We've had enough.

01:51:06.577 --> 01:51:08.953
- I'm disabling the voice recognition.
- So what? He can't hear me!

01:51:09.121 --> 01:51:11.498
- Yes, but he can see you!
- What?

01:51:12.875 --> 01:51:15.585
I'm putting him in shadow mode.
Show him what to do.

01:51:15.753 --> 01:51:18.213
Without the voice recognition,
he'll move even faster!

01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:22.342
- No way. No way!
- Look at them. They are freaking out!

01:51:22.510 --> 01:51:24.344
Rich girl is ripping him
a new one over there!

01:51:24.512 --> 01:51:26.596
Do you know why?
Because they're scared.

01:51:26.764 --> 01:51:28.932
Because Atom can do things
no other bot has ever done.

01:51:29.099 --> 01:51:30.809
- But I can't do it!
- Yes, you can.

01:51:30.976 --> 01:51:34.187
- I can't, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

01:51:34.897 --> 01:51:38.441
Show him what to do.
You have to fight the last round.

01:51:38.609 --> 01:51:43.029
- Don't ask me. Don't.
- Charlie... please.

01:51:43.823 --> 01:51:45.490
I beg you.

01:51:53.499 --> 01:51:54.958
Are you kidding me with those eyes?

01:51:56.794 --> 01:52:00.088
- Damn it!
- Yes!

01:52:00.256 --> 01:52:02.674
I can't believe I'm doing this.

01:52:02.842 --> 01:52:05.343
I know you're in there! I'm not sure
if you're getting this or what,

01:52:05.511 --> 01:52:06.761
but I know you're in there!

01:52:06.929 --> 01:52:09.180
- Come on, Kenton. In or out?
- In. Give me a minute.

01:52:12.726 --> 01:52:17.522
I know you can't hear me,
but you can see me, so watch me!

01:52:17.898 --> 01:52:20.108
Watch... me.

01:52:20.276 --> 01:52:23.820
- You know you're talking to a robot.
- I know. Shut up.

01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:26.698
Watch me.

01:52:27.032 --> 01:52:28.950
An epic battle
being waged here tonight,

01:52:29.118 --> 01:52:31.244
as the fifth
and final round gets underway.

01:52:31.412 --> 01:52:33.079
Come on, Atom!

01:52:42.715 --> 01:52:44.966
Wait a second, Herb.
Are you seeing this?

01:52:45.134 --> 01:52:48.219
Charlie Kenton
is shadowboxing just outside the ring!

01:52:48.387 --> 01:52:50.638
Tim, it looks like Atom
has a shadow function.

01:52:50.806 --> 01:52:53.433
So, basically,
that means Charlie Kenton

01:52:53.601 --> 01:52:56.561
is fighting the last round
of this fight against Zeus.

01:52:56.729 --> 01:52:58.938
Well, I tell you what, it doesn't
seem to be much help,

01:52:59.106 --> 01:53:01.190
because Atom is backed up
against the ropes again.

01:53:03.110 --> 01:53:04.944
Charlie, help him! Fight back!

01:53:05.112 --> 01:53:06.362
Not yet.

01:53:08.908 --> 01:53:13.536
Tak Mashido supervising
personally as Zeus hammers down,

01:53:13.704 --> 01:53:17.582
furiously trying
to end this thing once and for all.

01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:20.752
I got to tell you,
folks, the champ looks tired.

01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:23.212
This robot
seems to be running on empty.

01:53:27.009 --> 01:53:29.302
I don't believe it.
Atom is taunting Zeus.

01:53:29.470 --> 01:53:33.097
- Switch to turbo!
- He's actually asking for more.

01:53:35.017 --> 01:53:36.559
Please do something!

01:53:36.727 --> 01:53:39.145
- Not yet.
- That's right, Charlie. Not yet.

01:53:41.857 --> 01:53:43.316
Nitrous pistons, now!

01:53:46.445 --> 01:53:48.446
Charlie, he's not going
to last much longer!

01:53:48.614 --> 01:53:50.990
- Fight back!
- Not yet.

01:53:51.158 --> 01:53:52.408
Hang in there!

01:53:52.576 --> 01:53:55.620
Atom is riddled
with the nitrous-fueled

01:53:55.788 --> 01:53:58.998
Gatling guns of Zeus's blows!

01:53:59.166 --> 01:54:02.877
Atom! Atom!
Atom! Atom!

01:54:06.340 --> 01:54:08.549
Wait him out,
wait him out! Not yet!

01:54:11.136 --> 01:54:13.137
Zeus is slowing down!

01:54:13.305 --> 01:54:16.057
Tim, the champ's power core
is clearly depleted.

01:54:16.225 --> 01:54:17.392
Charlie, please!

01:54:19.645 --> 01:54:22.605
- Hey, kid. Now.
- Now!

01:54:28.445 --> 01:54:29.570
Get in there!
Don't let him breathe!

01:54:31.991 --> 01:54:34.283
Knock that little bitch!
Bust him open!

01:54:43.252 --> 01:54:44.544
Yeah! That's right!

01:54:46.171 --> 01:54:47.422
Do something!

01:54:48.298 --> 01:54:49.340
Move!

01:54:50.843 --> 01:54:53.177
Override. Switching to manual.

01:54:55.264 --> 01:54:57.974
In a shocking move,
Tak Mashido is manually

01:54:58.142 --> 01:55:00.018
operating his robot personally!

01:55:10.571 --> 01:55:12.071
Work the body! Get inside him!

01:55:12.239 --> 01:55:13.239
Get him, Atom!

01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:17.326
Look at this!
The champ is trying

01:55:17.494 --> 01:55:21.330
desperately to stay on his feet
but Kenton is relentless,

01:55:21.498 --> 01:55:24.917
landing blow after blow
after blow to the body!

01:56:07.127 --> 01:56:09.295
Left! Right! Left! Right!

01:56:09.463 --> 01:56:12.757
A huge uppercut by Atom!

01:56:12.925 --> 01:56:14.759
Zeus is down!

01:56:17.471 --> 01:56:20.473
- Yeah!
- This little bot

01:56:20.641 --> 01:56:25.394
has dug deep here tonight
and shown something damn near heart!

01:56:25.562 --> 01:56:29.690
One, two, three,

01:56:29.858 --> 01:56:34.737
four, five, six, seven...

01:56:34.905 --> 01:56:35.905
He's good!

01:56:36.073 --> 01:56:37.240
Zeus gets to his feet.

01:56:37.407 --> 01:56:39.575
But Kenton has
Atom on him again,

01:56:39.743 --> 01:56:42.245
landing punch after punch!

01:56:42.412 --> 01:56:44.622
Tak Mashido
and his super bot have no answer.

01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:47.750
Zeus pins Atom's left arm,
but Kenton is undaunted!

01:56:47.918 --> 01:56:50.169
It all comes down to this, folks!

01:56:50.337 --> 01:56:52.171
Drop him, Charlie! Now!

01:56:52.339 --> 01:56:54.382
Kenton
is about to drop the champ...

01:56:54.550 --> 01:56:56.384
No! There's the bell!

01:56:56.552 --> 01:56:59.303
Zeus is saved by the bell!

01:57:04.101 --> 01:57:05.351
No!

01:57:05.519 --> 01:57:08.521
Amazingly, Tim,
we will go to the judges' cards!

01:57:19.575 --> 01:57:21.701
Now, go on.

01:57:22.035 --> 01:57:25.955
Ladies and gentlemen,
after five rounds,

01:57:26.123 --> 01:57:28.791
we go to the judges' scorecards.

01:57:32.754 --> 01:57:37.175
Judge Number One
scores the fight 47-48.

01:57:37.342 --> 01:57:42.263
Judge Number Two
scores the fight 48-46.

01:57:42.431 --> 01:57:47.059
And Judge Number Three
scores the fight 47-46

01:57:47.227 --> 01:57:52.398
for the winner
and still World Robot Boxing champion,

01:57:52.566 --> 01:57:54.942
Zeus!

01:58:00.282 --> 01:58:04.452
Farra... Farra...
Farra Lemkova...

01:58:04.620 --> 01:58:06.954
...you got way more
than you bargained for tonight.

01:58:07.122 --> 01:58:09.332
Some would say
that your bot won the decision

01:58:09.499 --> 01:58:11.083
but lost the fight.

01:58:11.251 --> 01:58:12.627
Oh, she looks pissed.

01:58:12.794 --> 01:58:15.421
It took a little longer
than we thought,

01:58:15.589 --> 01:58:18.925
but the result is as expected.

01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:21.010
We won.

01:58:21.803 --> 01:58:24.680
Zeus is still undefeated.

01:58:27.434 --> 01:58:29.852
Tak... Tak Mashido... Tak...

01:58:30.020 --> 01:58:32.855
Any comment on the absolutely
humiliating near loss

01:58:33.023 --> 01:58:34.649
your bot suffered tonight?

01:58:37.653 --> 01:58:40.071
- Nothing.
- No comment.

01:58:40.239 --> 01:58:41.656
Max. Where's Max?

01:58:41.823 --> 01:58:42.907
Max, let's go, go.

01:58:45.369 --> 01:58:48.079
There he is. Max. Max.

01:58:48.247 --> 01:58:52.291
They're already calling
your bot "the people's champion."

01:58:52.459 --> 01:58:54.961
Yeah!

01:58:55.128 --> 01:58:57.088
Max, what do you say to that?

01:58:58.048 --> 01:58:59.507
People's champion?

01:59:02.094 --> 01:59:03.928
Sounds pretty good to me.

01:59:09.393 --> 01:59:11.602
Dad? Dad!

01:59:11.770 --> 01:59:14.021
Max! Max! Max!

01:59:15.482 --> 01:59:16.649
- Max!
- Dad!

01:59:24.157 --> 01:59:27.410
Max... Max, I...
