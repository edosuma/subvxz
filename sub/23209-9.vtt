06:59.078 --> 07:01.312
who in turn were murdered by someone else

07:05.818 --> 07:07.451

why were the organs harvested?

07:07.487 --> 07:09.153
Well, there were

07:09.188 --> 07:11.489
about three-quarters of a
million dollars' worth of organs

07:11.524 --> 07:13.624
left in the cooler
outside the emergency room.

07:13.659 --> 07:15.659
Which tells me that
whoever killed these two

07:15.695 --> 07:17.495
did not do it for material gain.

07:17.530 --> 07:19.930
"I will repay" was written on the cooler.

07:19.966 --> 07:21.765
- Sounds like a motive?
- Yeah.

is not familiar

07:24.697 --> 07:26.409

07:26.444 --> 07:28.506
that no hospital is gonna take
those organs.

But, you know, maybe we can find
a use for them.

07:31.511 --> 07:34.612
I mean, someone went to a lot
of trouble just to let them go.

07:34.647 --> 07:36.347
Well, the cooler that was left
at the hospital

07:36.382 --> 07:38.182

16:37.712 --> 16:39.565
I wasn't praying for him.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.049
I was praying for a puppy.

16:43.084 --> 16:44.850
(LAUGHS)

16:44.886 --> 16:48.491
And we got one that Christmas.

16:49.390 --> 16:51.958
I thought God had performed a miracle.

16:51.993 --> 16:54.427
I finally know why
I'm not a Christian, Scully.

16:54.462 --> 16:56.896
My parents never got me a puppy.

16:59.567 --> 17:02.602
So are you-you praying
for another miracle now?

17:02.637 --> 17:05.471
I don't know if I believe in miracles.

17:05.506 --> 17:09.308
But I do know the power of faith.

17:10.944 --> 17:15.414
I saw it in my mom,
the strength that she received.

17:16.144 --> 17:18.617
I could use some of that strength now.

17:20.755 --> 17:22.358
I need what you have.

17:23.290 --> 17:26.069
You always bear north, Mulder...

17:27.028 --> 17:28.394
no matter which way

17:28.429 --> 17:32.298
or how hard the wind blows against you.

17:38.273 --> 17:41.127
I think all I have...

17:41.709 --> 17:44.944
all any of us have are the results

17:44.979 --> 17:47.383
of all the choices that we've made.

17:48.616 --> 17:50.583
And at the end of the day,

17:51.179 --> 17:53.452
we just hope that we made the right one.

There's three bars missing.

the church to exact vengeance.

18:27.188 --> 18:29.322
Oh...

18:29.357 --> 18:32.992
One day without my "dinnie,"
and look at me.

18:33.471 --> 18:35.861
I can already see the lines.

18:36.898 --> 18:38.297
I want to cry.

18:38.333 --> 18:40.866
You look perfectly beautiful.

18:40.902 --> 18:44.203
Not a day over 33, when I first
fell in love with you.

18:44.238 --> 18:46.234
That's sweet.

18:47.542 --> 18:50.643
You don't look bad for an 85-year-old.

All thanks to Kayla.

You're my addiction, Dr. Luvenis.

18:56.784 --> 19:00.186
I will be a worthy companion
to you in no time.

19:02.256 --> 19:03.856
I'm beginning to wonder.

19:03.891 --> 19:06.359
No one could've predicted
what happened last night.

19:06.394 --> 19:08.661
But I have a friend at the hospital.

19:08.696 --> 19:10.663
He's heard rumors about recovered organs,

19:10.698 --> 19:13.492
organs they can't use.

19:13.527 --> 19:14.699
Our organs.

19:14.734 --> 19:17.579
Your excuses don't solve the problem.

19:17.614 --> 19:20.206
- I will find them.
- Attached to Kayla?

19:20.241 --> 19:22.375
(LAUGHING): I don't think so.

19:24.612 --> 19:26.317
- Barbara...
- I think you'll agree

19:26.353 --> 19:29.281
that failure should not be rewarded.

Mm-hmm.

19:40.061 --> 19:41.394
Do you trust me?

19:42.094 --> 19:44.530

- No.

19:44.834 --> 19:46.866
You're living proof.

19:46.901 --> 19:48.134
That's right.

19:48.169 --> 19:50.870
- Close your eyes.
- Barbara, please.

You have news about my Olivia?

We spoke to Father Hardy at
St. Joseph's, and he said that

your daughter's been missing
for almost two months.

21:31.371 --> 21:32.734
- Is that right?
- Sí.

21:32.735 --> 21:34.201
Well, if we could maybe come in

21:34.236 --> 21:36.136
and look around, we might
be able to find something

21:36.171 --> 21:37.471
that would help us find your daughter.

No. You can't come in.

No. Eso no es verdad.

21:46.315 --> 21:48.115
Mom.

21:48.150 --> 21:49.850
The truth is,
Olivia couldn't stand looking

21:49.885 --> 21:51.985
at that girl staring back
at her in the mirror.

21:52.021 --> 21:54.021
She rejected her family and God.

21:55.858 --> 21:57.206

If she's being held against her will,

21:59.028 --> 22:01.228
we can investigate
and try and extract her.

I know my sister.

22:02.950 --> 22:05.365
All right? She doesn't want our life.

22:05.401 --> 22:06.700
To her, we're monsters.

22:06.735 --> 22:08.001
She thinks she can change who she is

them for unnatural purposes.

is not yet complete.

Only person I know is Barbara Beaumont.

29:45.118 --> 29:46.671
- Barbara Beaumont?
- She's been the owner of this building

29:46.707 --> 29:48.139

Then, um... nothing much ever again.

30:10.097 --> 30:13.198
So, at 85, does she need assistance?

30:13.233 --> 30:14.332
I don't know.

30:14.368 --> 30:15.834
Look, I... I never met her.

30:15.869 --> 30:17.402
Never even seen her. Once in a while,

30:17.437 --> 30:20.238
I get a note, I go up and fix stuff.

30:20.273 --> 30:22.674
I never see nobody when I go up there.

30:22.709 --> 30:24.342
But I know they're there,

- Seven years,

30:42.129 --> 30:43.528
and you've never talked to her?

30:43.563 --> 30:44.896
All right, it's weird, right?

30:44.931 --> 30:46.064
But this is the Bronx.

30:46.099 --> 30:47.465
Look, there's an envelope

30:47.501 --> 30:49.367
full of money in my mailbox
every two weeks.

This is the first time
there's ever been a problem.

and you've never crossed paths?

31:00.514 --> 31:02.313
It's 1890s.

31:02.349 --> 31:04.416
All right? It's got, like,
a dumbwaiter system.

31:04.451 --> 31:06.651
It's been modified,

31:06.686 --> 31:08.319
long before I ever got here.

31:10.023 --> 31:12.657
It's got, like, trapdoors and ladders.

31:12.692 --> 31:14.893
Goes down to the basement,

31:14.928 --> 31:17.662
then the sewers, the subway.

40:11.183 --> 40:13.717
