11:05.907 --> 11:10.484
Okay. I'm coming in.

11:10.504 --> 11:14.080
AUSTIN: Now remove
the aortic cross clamps.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.582
Give it a couple seconds
for his new heart to kick in.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.510
Moment of truth.

11:21.923 --> 11:23.072
Nothing.

11:23.091 --> 11:25.517
Paddles to me. Ten joules.

11:25.668 --> 11:26.910
(beeping)

11:26.928 --> 11:28.669
-Clear.
-(beeps)

11:28.763 --> 11:31.231
(thumps)

11:32.767 --> 11:34.767
Increase the charge to 20.

11:34.936 --> 11:36.677
AUSTIN:
Let's try it again.

11:36.697 --> 11:39.480
-Charging. Clear.
-(thumps)

11:40.275 --> 11:42.108
Maybe we're missing something.

11:42.260 --> 11:43.702
We've rechecked the electrolyte.

11:43.870 --> 11:44.944
It's not the potassium.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.279
All right,
give him a dose of magnesium

11:46.431 --> 11:48.355
and lidocaine.
We'll give it one last shot.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.617
-Charging.
-(high-pitched squeal)

11:51.712 --> 11:53.586
-Clear.
-(thumps)

12:02.797 --> 12:04.447
(thumping)

12:04.466 --> 12:05.890
(sighs)

12:06.042 --> 12:08.009
Normal sinus!

12:08.136 --> 12:10.061
(Austin laughs)

12:10.288 --> 12:12.972
MJ for the win
with two seconds left.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.625
(Austin laughs)

12:16.628 --> 12:20.238
I think these elephants would
look nice over the windows.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.366
Sammie's my best friend.

12:25.895 --> 12:27.320
I know, sweetie.

12:27.472 --> 12:30.473
I want to go to the hospital
to be with her.

12:30.566 --> 12:32.399
She needs me.

12:32.494 --> 12:34.586
(phone ringing)

12:34.662 --> 12:38.339
Okay, why don't you keep
coloring these hearts for me?

12:41.002 --> 12:43.002
Conrad, what's going on?

12:43.154 --> 12:45.171
Waiting on Sammie's labs.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.766
Just hoping
her cancer hasn't come back.

12:47.993 --> 12:49.509
(sighs)
Oh, no.

12:49.661 --> 12:51.511
<i> How is Gigi?</i>

12:51.663 --> 12:53.663
Oh, she's fine,
but she keeps saying she wants

12:53.681 --> 12:56.090
to go to Chastain, you know,
to be with Sammie.

12:56.109 --> 12:59.277
<i> I'll try and keep her busy.</i>
<i> Keep me updated.</i>

12:59.428 --> 13:01.321
Will do.

13:02.023 --> 13:04.365
(Sammie coughs weakly)

13:06.511 --> 13:07.844
(knocking)

13:07.862 --> 13:09.454
I'm Dr. Ian Sullivan.

13:09.605 --> 13:11.956
Dr. Voss asked me to consult
on your daughter's case.

13:12.108 --> 13:14.367
Of course. We know you
by your reputation.

13:14.519 --> 13:17.036
Thank you so much
for coming in. I'm Jake.

13:17.188 --> 13:19.038
And I'm Gregg.
We are so glad you're here.

13:19.190 --> 13:21.040
If anyone can save her...

13:21.209 --> 13:23.693
Honestly, we just have
so much faith.

13:23.711 --> 13:25.428
An-And trust in you.

13:28.291 --> 13:31.059
And this must be Sammie.
How are you feeling?

13:31.886 --> 13:33.311
Not so great.

13:33.538 --> 13:36.981
But I think,
now that you're here,

13:37.133 --> 13:40.151
I'll start to feel better soon.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.064
-(labored breathing)
-Okay, Sammie.

13:45.158 --> 13:49.143
I am going to listen to your
lungs and then your heart.

13:49.162 --> 13:52.572
Okay. That's it.
Take a deep breath for me.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.815
(coughs)
Sorry.

13:54.835 --> 13:58.077
-That-that wasn't really good.
-No, you're doing just fine.

13:58.229 --> 14:02.065
-(exhales)
-Okay.

14:02.083 --> 14:04.067
Now I am going
to press on your belly, okay?

14:04.085 --> 14:07.136
-My belly doesn't hurt.
-Oh, that's good.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.164
Okay, princess, you sit tight.

14:10.258 --> 14:11.665
If anything gets worse,

14:11.685 --> 14:13.334
or if something new starts
to bother you,

14:13.411 --> 14:15.761
I want you
to press that red button, okay?

14:15.914 --> 14:18.398
And then I'd come running.

14:20.268 --> 14:22.676
Thank you
for coming in so quickly.

14:22.770 --> 14:26.013
Of course. She's a heartbreaker.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.565
Have you seen
Sammie's medical history?

14:27.792 --> 14:29.516
I'm about to take a deep dive
into all that immediately.

14:29.611 --> 14:33.262
-I just did a brief exam.
-Do you think it's cancer?

14:33.281 --> 14:36.282
Fear of a recurrence
is understandable,

14:36.376 --> 14:38.042
but it could be a host
of different things.

14:38.194 --> 14:41.104
The effusion could be secondary
to an infection,

14:41.122 --> 14:42.939
which would fit
with the low-grade fever.

14:42.957 --> 14:44.774
I'll order more cultures.

14:44.792 --> 14:47.343
-Thank you.
-Sit tight.

14:55.044 --> 14:56.710
Strong pressure,
normal heart sound.

14:56.730 --> 14:59.230
Limited mediastinal output.
We can put these to water seal.

14:59.382 --> 15:00.973
At this rate,
we can clamp the tubes tomorrow.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.401
I'll order another chest X-ray.

15:03.628 --> 15:05.144
Translation?

15:05.296 --> 15:07.721
Your new heart
is functioning well, Governor.

15:07.741 --> 15:10.909
Ah. Oh. Is...?

15:11.136 --> 15:13.136
Is-is... is this pain normal?

15:13.138 --> 15:14.746
-(yells)
-(alarm sounding)

15:14.897 --> 15:16.639
BP 60/40.

15:16.732 --> 15:18.307
-He's in shock.
-LEELA: No signs of obstruction

15:18.401 --> 15:20.067
in the chest tube.
Unlikely to be a tension pneumo.

15:20.236 --> 15:22.311
The valves sound good.
He's still in sinus.

15:22.405 --> 15:24.738
-Crank up the norepi.
-Add vaso.

15:24.816 --> 15:25.906
And start vanc and cefepime.

15:25.926 --> 15:28.551
We need an ultrasound
in here now!

15:33.675 --> 15:34.915
-Hey.
-What's going on?

15:34.935 --> 15:36.676
I thought you resigned.

15:36.828 --> 15:38.161
I'm here at Dr. Voss's request

15:38.254 --> 15:40.846
to consult
on Bell's granddaughter's case.

15:40.999 --> 15:43.166
-A consult only?
-Yes, I promise.

15:43.168 --> 15:45.168
If they end up
needing a surgeon,

15:45.261 --> 15:46.427
I'll help them find a good one.

15:46.521 --> 15:48.780
Well, what if
there's an emergency?

15:49.007 --> 15:50.448
Then I'll tell Kit everything.

15:50.599 --> 15:53.025
Everything? Including how
you were using here?

15:53.178 --> 15:55.119
Yes. I would rather avoid it,
but I will.

15:55.271 --> 15:57.455
Would you like to be a witness?

15:58.366 --> 16:01.200
Dad, it's just,
you've come such a long way,

16:01.294 --> 16:02.943
and this commitment
to honesty...

16:02.963 --> 16:04.520
I haven't had to be honest yet.

16:04.539 --> 16:06.872
I wouldn't say
there's anything too admirable.

16:07.025 --> 16:08.541
But unless you object,

16:08.693 --> 16:10.193
I'd like to stay,
as long as there's a chance

16:10.286 --> 16:12.786
I can help that sweet kid
and her family.

16:12.806 --> 16:15.047
Of course.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.867
Let me know if there's anything
I can do to help.

16:17.960 --> 16:19.519
All right.

16:23.224 --> 16:25.466
Oh. Does Sammie have a visitor?

16:25.560 --> 16:28.044
Conrad thought it might not
be a good idea, but she...

16:28.062 --> 16:30.062
I said I had to come.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.447
I couldn't refuse her.

16:32.383 --> 16:34.993
Okay. Well, I think you may be

16:35.144 --> 16:37.537
just the person Sammie needs.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.340
Sammie's been asleep for a bit.

16:49.567 --> 16:52.260
Jake and Gregg just took
the chance to get us some food.

17:03.598 --> 17:06.065
Gigi.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.843
(panting)
Birthday.

17:09.937 --> 17:12.271
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.681
We'll have a party
when you're all better.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.927
For now, just sleep.

17:18.020 --> 17:19.704
I'll be right here.

17:19.855 --> 17:22.373
She is just like her mother.

17:24.026 --> 17:27.462
I feel like I just saw Nic.

17:32.443 --> 17:35.035
Cardiac index is marginal,
even on pressors.

17:35.055 --> 17:37.129
Steroids are not improving
contractility.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.705
His heart's only getting worse.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.224
-Let's intubate.
-Yeah.

17:40.376 --> 17:42.968
That'll offload some of the
pressure on his left ventricle

17:43.063 --> 17:44.545
and buy us some more time.

17:44.639 --> 17:46.122
Labs are back.

17:46.140 --> 17:47.381
Antibody testing
is completely negative.

17:47.550 --> 17:49.216
So rejection
is extremely unlikely.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.810
But if he's not rejecting
the transplanted heart,

17:50.962 --> 17:52.128
then what is it?

17:52.146 --> 17:54.530
AUSTIN:
Rechecking his echo.

17:58.136 --> 18:00.060
CONRAD:
It's subtle.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.246
Apical wall akinesis,

18:02.398 --> 18:05.324
-hyperdynamic septum.
-Stress cardiomyopathy.

18:05.476 --> 18:07.827
Something else in his body
is causing his heart to tank,

18:07.921 --> 18:11.005
and we got to figure out
what it is fast.

18:12.667 --> 18:15.093
I got this.

18:21.326 --> 18:23.750
-Hey.
-Labs and pleural fluid
are back.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.269
There are no malignant cells.

18:25.496 --> 18:27.772
So it's not cancer.
Did you hear that?

18:27.923 --> 18:29.014
The cancer hasn't returned.

18:29.167 --> 18:30.924
(sighs)
That's great news.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.835
But if it's not cancer,
then what is it?

18:32.854 --> 18:34.654
She's having trouble breathing.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.075
We have to know what's wrong
to treat it.

18:41.028 --> 18:43.079
I'll be back.

18:44.607 --> 18:47.683
Hey, just the guy
I'm looking for.

18:47.685 --> 18:50.461
Same here.

18:51.297 --> 18:54.114
So, we've effectively
ruled out rejection for Betz.

18:54.134 --> 18:57.117
And we've ruled out cancer
for Sammie.

18:57.211 --> 18:59.044
CONRAD:
Infectious studies?

18:59.197 --> 19:00.880
DEVON:
Blood cultures are negative
so far.

19:00.974 --> 19:03.123
Same here.
Galactomannan and glucan?

19:03.201 --> 19:05.476
Pending, but Sammie
is not a likely host

19:05.628 --> 19:06.811
for a fungal infection.

19:06.962 --> 19:08.462
Neither is Betz.

19:08.631 --> 19:11.983
Maybe I should
just add micafungin.

19:12.134 --> 19:14.652
All right,
so his pressure's getting worse.

19:14.879 --> 19:17.713
What if it's not vasodilatory?

19:17.732 --> 19:21.066
How about obstructive shock
or pneumothorax?

19:21.161 --> 19:22.476
And tamponade. Ruled out.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.237
I thought
about adrenal insufficiencies.

19:25.390 --> 19:27.481
But you've given him a slug
of steroids anyway.

19:27.558 --> 19:29.892
Which is about the only thing
you haven't given Sammie.

19:29.985 --> 19:31.243
I'm still thinking
infectious is possible

19:31.396 --> 19:33.913
despite the negative
fluid studies.

19:34.065 --> 19:36.174
Considered autoimmune?

19:36.325 --> 19:39.919
ANA, ANCA, rheumatoid factor
are all in lab.

19:40.071 --> 19:42.087
But you don't want
to empirically treat?

19:42.164 --> 19:45.057
Not with the concern
for infection.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.060
We got nothing.

19:51.933 --> 19:53.274
You know what?

19:54.677 --> 19:58.679
You taught me, from
my very first day at Chastain,

19:58.698 --> 20:01.032
that if the answer isn't
on these white boards...

20:01.201 --> 20:04.202
Go back to the patient
and the physical exam.

20:05.705 --> 20:09.874
Have I ever told you, you were
the best intern I ever had?

20:10.101 --> 20:12.460
Well, I had the best teacher.

20:15.273 --> 20:16.881
Nearly maxed on epi drip.

20:17.032 --> 20:19.550
Repeat labs are back.

20:19.702 --> 20:22.220
His lactate is sky-high.

20:22.371 --> 20:24.630
Not a surprise.
He's been hypotensive for hours.

20:24.724 --> 20:28.434
Wait. The lactate isn't
the result of the hypotension.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.638
It's a clue about the cause.

20:32.790 --> 20:35.066
AUSTIN:
Right. Right.

20:35.293 --> 20:37.643
We've been so focused
on the heart.

20:37.795 --> 20:40.629
What if...?

20:40.723 --> 20:42.314
Distended abdomen.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.242
It's barely noticeable,
but I think you're right.

20:44.427 --> 20:46.135
-He has bowel ischemia?
-CONRAD: Yup.

20:46.228 --> 20:48.637
-That explains the shock.
-And the heart failure.

20:48.656 --> 20:51.064
We'll need to take him to CT
to confirm, but if we're right,

20:51.158 --> 20:52.566
he'll have to go back to the OR.

20:52.660 --> 20:54.752
I'll page Bell.

20:55.904 --> 21:00.132
IAN:
Just take a few deep breaths
for me, Sammie.

21:00.835 --> 21:03.135
Why is her tongue red?

21:06.975 --> 21:08.173
Lean back for me, Sammie.

21:08.326 --> 21:10.843
Open up and say "aah," okay?

21:10.995 --> 21:13.562
Aah.

21:14.999 --> 21:16.590
Strawberry tongue.

21:16.609 --> 21:20.002
-She has Kawasaki disease.
-That would explain

21:20.021 --> 21:21.337
the fever
and the flu-like symptoms.

21:21.430 --> 21:23.781
DEVON:
Now we can treat it.

21:24.008 --> 21:25.116
Let's start her on IVIG.

21:25.267 --> 21:27.693
-(phone buzzing)
-That's-that's great news.

21:28.513 --> 21:30.103
I can't believe it.
Um, AJ needs me.

21:30.197 --> 21:33.082
It's Betz. Got to go.

21:37.964 --> 21:40.039
-(alarms sound)
-(gasps, yells)

21:40.133 --> 21:42.041
-Sammie, what's wrong?
-IAN: Must be some kind

21:42.193 --> 21:44.635
of cardiac complication related
to the Kawasaki.

21:44.862 --> 21:45.970
All right. You guys stay here.

21:46.121 --> 21:47.863
We're gonna get her
to the cath lab.

21:47.998 --> 21:50.391
And page Yamada.

21:55.464 --> 21:57.315
Got your page. What's going on?

21:57.466 --> 22:00.042
-Betz isn't rejecting the heart.
-Okay.

22:00.061 --> 22:01.877
CONRAD:
Here's the problem.

22:01.970 --> 22:03.712
Bowel ischemia.

22:03.731 --> 22:06.398
That's your specialty, Bell.

22:06.551 --> 22:08.159
It is, but the last bowel
ischemia we had,

22:08.310 --> 22:09.994
the patient died on the table,
and that guy in there

22:10.145 --> 22:11.662
made sure I got sued.

22:12.557 --> 22:15.240
Well, we need you to
operate on him.

22:15.317 --> 22:17.692
Is that going to be a problem?

22:17.694 --> 22:21.505
No. I'll save the S.O.B.

22:22.825 --> 22:25.901
DEVON:
She has a giant
coronary aneurysm,

22:25.920 --> 22:27.903
a result of the Kawasaki.

22:27.922 --> 22:29.162
JAMES:
It looks clotted off.

22:29.182 --> 22:31.090
IAN:
And partially ruptured.

22:31.184 --> 22:33.576
Blood is accumulating around
the heart, causing tamponade.

22:33.594 --> 22:36.095
I can do a pericardiocentesis
right now,

22:36.189 --> 22:38.138
but it's only a temporary fix.

22:38.265 --> 22:40.082
Look, the aneurysm could rupture
at any second.

22:40.101 --> 22:42.526
She's gonna need
coronary artery bypass surgery.

22:42.603 --> 22:44.695
A CABG on a ten-year-old?
That's unheard of.

22:44.847 --> 22:46.105
Look, ischemic heart,

22:46.199 --> 22:48.366
MI, sudden cardiac death.
She could have it all.

22:48.517 --> 22:51.351
The surgery's a Hail Mary, but
it gives Sammie her only shot.

22:51.371 --> 22:54.113
Okay. I'll book an OR,
Dr. Sullivan.

22:54.207 --> 22:56.115
When can you be ready?

22:56.209 --> 22:58.692
I'm gonna need a half hour.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.378
Okay.

23:03.274 --> 23:05.365
So, tell me
where we are with Sammie.

23:05.385 --> 23:07.459
Then I have
to scrub in for Betz.

23:07.612 --> 23:09.870
She has a GCA--
giant coronary aneurysm.

23:09.964 --> 23:11.889
Oh, God.

23:11.966 --> 23:14.450
I'm sorry.
As I'm sure you're both aware,

23:14.468 --> 23:17.544
the surgery to fix this is
incredibly risky, but

23:17.563 --> 23:21.047
at this point, it's the
only path left to save her life.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.733
At least we know what's wrong.

23:22.960 --> 23:24.610
Yeah, yeah.

23:26.631 --> 23:29.723
Obviously, you're the best
person to operate.

23:29.817 --> 23:32.151
You still have privileges here.

23:32.245 --> 23:34.319
Look, I'm ready,
and I-I want to help,

23:34.396 --> 23:38.323
but there's something
that you need to know first.

23:39.160 --> 23:44.255
I was not hiking across Spain
these last few weeks.

23:44.907 --> 23:47.216
I was in rehab.

23:49.077 --> 23:50.928
Rehab for what?

23:51.079 --> 23:52.671
Addiction to pills.
Uppers, downers.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.765
Whatever I needed to...

23:54.917 --> 23:56.767
relieve stress, to focus,

23:56.844 --> 23:58.769
to do my best during surgery.

23:58.996 --> 24:01.013
At least that was my excuse.

24:01.165 --> 24:03.999
Were you operating
here at Chastain

24:04.018 --> 24:06.001
while under the influence?

24:06.020 --> 24:09.262
-Yes.
-So you lied.

24:09.356 --> 24:13.192
You some... somehow
cheated the drug tests

24:13.286 --> 24:15.010
and put sick children
in jeopardy.

24:15.103 --> 24:16.269
Yes, but I never
harmed a patient.

24:16.289 --> 24:18.956
I was a functioning addict,
I was...

24:19.183 --> 24:22.184
Look, there's no excuse,
there's no justification.

24:22.186 --> 24:24.628
I'm not doing that.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.780
This is a disaster.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.358
Sammie needs the OR now.

24:29.376 --> 24:31.802
-I mean, what do we do?
-IAN: Look, I am sober.

24:31.954 --> 24:33.378
I intend to stay that way.

24:33.473 --> 24:35.698
If you have lost your trust
in me, I fully understand.

24:35.700 --> 24:38.884

surgeon at Atlanta General

24:39.036 --> 24:40.869
who can do this, okay?

24:40.963 --> 24:42.387
I have been in contact
with colleagues

24:42.482 --> 24:44.223
in Boston and New York,
and they can be here tomorrow.

24:44.317 --> 24:46.875

drug-test you in time

you're sober right now.

We have no choice.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.844
And now...

35:05.996 --> 35:07.679
Devon, I'm just...

35:07.831 --> 35:10.941
I'm just so glad it's you...

35:11.092 --> 35:14.111
that holds my life
in your hands.

35:16.764 --> 35:19.507
Let's beat this.

35:19.559 --> 35:21.693
Together.

35:21.769 --> 35:23.495
All right.

35:29.461 --> 35:30.544
Thank you.

35:32.113 --> 35:34.038
Welcome back.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.384
God, I'm so excited
to see the boys.

35:38.695 --> 35:42.305
-I'm so sorry for everything.
-Hey, don't be.

35:42.457 --> 35:45.867
Postpartum depression
is a medical condition

35:45.886 --> 35:48.461
that can affect anyone.

35:48.555 --> 35:50.463
And we both want you to know
that we support you.

35:50.482 --> 35:53.708
And we believe you are going to
be a great mother to our boys.

35:53.727 --> 35:57.303
And I promise to always be
honest with you and let you know

35:57.397 --> 35:59.230

-Good.

35:59.324 --> 36:02.808

Devon's MS trial,

You and I have something
in common, don't we?

We both have
an incurable disease.

Yeah, but I can't cure mine
with will power.

37:56.424 --> 37:58.275
Well, you've done
pretty good so far.

37:58.426 --> 38:01.528
You know,
there's another thing we share.

38:03.282 --> 38:05.448
When I agreed
to do Betz's surgery,

38:05.675 --> 38:08.267
I knew my symptoms were
getting worse, and I believed

38:08.361 --> 38:11.029
that I could control something
I couldn't control.

38:11.123 --> 38:12.772
You're worried
I won't stay sober.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.365
I'm worried that you, like me,

38:14.459 --> 38:17.852
have the worst disease
of this profession--

38:17.945 --> 38:20.130
arrogance.

38:20.281 --> 38:23.041
Are you capable
of policing yourself?

38:23.117 --> 38:25.969
Arrogance was never my problem.

38:26.863 --> 38:29.030
It was the opposite-- fear...

38:29.049 --> 38:32.976
that I'm not good enough,
that I am an imposter.

38:33.127 --> 38:35.395
Drugs took the fear away.

38:36.148 --> 38:38.206
Why didn't you come to Kit

38:38.299 --> 38:40.633
and tell her you had a problem?

38:40.727 --> 38:42.527
Fear again.

38:43.989 --> 38:46.548
I didn't want to lose the thing

38:46.566 --> 38:49.067
that was most precious to me,
beside Cade.

38:49.161 --> 38:52.070
But she has her own life.

38:52.222 --> 38:54.980
At the end of the day...

38:55.000 --> 38:57.334
every night, I go home alone.

38:58.653 --> 39:00.503
The work--

39:00.730 --> 39:04.257
this-- is what I have.

39:05.993 --> 39:08.261
Well, that I understand.

39:10.073 --> 39:11.681
'Cause I was that guy.

39:11.833 --> 39:15.000
-Hmm.
-For decades.

39:15.095 --> 39:17.687
But not anymore.
Now with Kit,

39:17.914 --> 39:20.357
I mean... I mean, there's a
whole world outside these walls.

39:20.584 --> 39:23.026
I don't think
you'll be outside for too long.

39:23.195 --> 39:25.511
Well, Kit and my family
will be my priority,

39:25.530 --> 39:27.680
and possibly helping
to find a cure for this disease.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.682
But I'm-I'm not gonna disappear.

39:29.776 --> 39:32.351
I'll teach incoming interns.

39:32.371 --> 39:35.613
Well, that is one
of your finest skills.

39:48.128 --> 39:50.962

39:51.038 --> 39:52.889
And now, on the day

39:53.040 --> 39:56.618
you become an attending,

39:56.636 --> 39:58.136
I give it to you.
