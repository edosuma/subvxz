<i>If you know anything</i>

00:01.080 --> 00:03.840
<i>about Catherine McCain's death
you need to tell me.</i>

00:03.840 --> 00:07.480
<i>We know Bobby Moran
didn't kill Catherine McCain.</i>

00:07.480 --> 00:09.600
<i>Bobby lies all the time.</i>

00:09.600 --> 00:11.840
<i>You have to tell the police
Cara's your alibi.</i>

00:11.840 --> 00:13.640
<i>Oh, God, Cara.</i>

00:13.640 --> 00:15.080
<i>You are part of him setting me up.</i>

00:15.080 --> 00:16.760
<i>Joe, that is ridiculous.</i>

00:16.760 --> 00:19.480
<i>Why would someone want
to set you up for murder?</i>

00:19.480 --> 00:21.840
<i>Why would anyone hate me
enough to do that? I don't know.</i>

00:21.840 --> 00:24.800
<i>I've never fallen out of love
with you. Never.</i>

00:24.800 --> 00:27.720
<i>Bobby Morgan submitted a request
to view his file.</i>

00:27.720 --> 00:29.360
<i>What names would he have seen?</i>

00:29.360 --> 00:31.840
<i>Well, maybe,
we're all being punished.</i>

00:31.840 --> 00:34.280
<i>Oh, Jesus, I condemned his dad
to being a paedophile.</i>

00:34.280 --> 00:36.960
<i>I'm trying to track down someone
I used to worked with</i>

00:36.960 --> 00:38.280
<i>in Liverpool, years ago.</i>

00:38.280 --> 00:39.880
<i>Mr Erskine?</i>

01:19.680 --> 01:22.520
<i>Neighbours said Rupert Erskine
was quiet.</i>

01:22.520 --> 01:25.080
<i>No-one had anything to say
apart from he kept bees.</i>

01:25.080 --> 01:28.520
<i>He's been there a week, maybe two.</i>

01:28.520 --> 01:31.920
<i>There's no sign of wounds
or any trauma to indicate violence.</i>

01:31.920 --> 01:33.080
<i>With his mouth taped shut</i>

01:33.080 --> 01:35.080
<i>cause of death
was probably dehydration.</i>

01:35.080 --> 01:37.080
<i>It would have taken him
a long time to die</i>

01:37.080 --> 01:39.040
<i>in considerable pain and discomfort.</i>

01:39.040 --> 01:41.120
<i>So, someone really didn't like him.</i>

01:41.120 --> 01:42.800
<i>It was a punishment killing.</i>

01:42.800 --> 01:44.480
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:46.760 --> 01:51.280
<i>We need to find out what Erskine's
connection to O'Loughlin was,</i>

01:51.280 --> 01:53.760
<i>other than them
having worked together.</i>

01:53.760 --> 01:55.640
<i>Erskine knew something?</i>

01:55.640 --> 01:58.680
<i>Something O'Loughlin didn't want
coming to the surface?</i>

01:58.680 --> 02:00.680
<i>But why the cruelty?</i>

02:00.680 --> 02:03.440
<i>And why would O'Loughlin
ask Rachael Fenwick</i>

02:03.440 --> 02:06.720
<i>to find Erskine for him,
if he killed him two weeks ago?</i>

02:06.720 --> 02:09.360
<i>He assumed we were listening in
on his calls,</i>

02:09.360 --> 02:11.240
<i>and he wanted to seem innocent.</i>

02:11.240 --> 02:13.120
<i>A jury might buy it.</i>

02:13.120 --> 02:16.520
<i>It's what he's done all along, sir,
he's trying to play us.</i>

02:16.520 --> 02:17.720
<i>Mm.</i>

02:17.720 --> 02:19.160
<i>Well, along with Bobby's family,</i>

02:19.160 --> 02:22.200
<i>maybe there's another list of people
whose safety we need to consider,</i>

02:22.200 --> 02:23.920
<i>the people he worked with
in Liverpool.</i>

02:23.920 --> 02:25.560
<i>I'll get onto that.</i>

02:26.760 --> 02:29.840
<i>And how we doing with tracing
Morgan's family?</i>

02:29.840 --> 02:31.760
<i>Well, there isn't many to trace.</i>

02:31.760 --> 02:36.720
<i>I mean, we're still trying to locate
a half-brother in Australia.</i>

02:36.720 --> 02:40.480
<i>And O'Loughlin,
do we think he's still in Liverpool?</i>

02:40.480 --> 02:42.520
<i>They swamped the area
around the Land Rover</i>

02:42.520 --> 02:44.400
<i>and they're still looking.
Thank you.</i>

02:55.760 --> 02:58.240
<i>So, he does this every day?
Yeah.</i>

02:58.240 --> 03:00.760
<i>Come rain or shine, his wife said.</i>

03:00.760 --> 03:04.280
<i>Painting over the graffiti,
his way of fighting the drug gangs.</i>

03:04.280 --> 03:05.880
<i>There he is.</i>

03:05.880 --> 03:08.880
<i>He was a great social worker.</i>

03:08.880 --> 03:12.400
<i>He helped push through
the court order for Bobby's dad.</i>

03:13.520 --> 03:16.160
<i>Doesn't look like
he's in a good way, does he?</i>

03:16.160 --> 03:17.480
<i>No. I'm hoping he can tell us</i>

03:17.480 --> 03:19.720
<i>who might've poisoned his daughter, though.</i>

03:19.720 --> 03:22.520
<i>I just don't wanna cause him
any more pain.</i>

03:23.840 --> 03:25.360
<i>Wish me luck.</i>

<i>Hi.</i>

03:37.400 --> 03:39.440
<i>It's Joe O'Loughlin?</i>

03:41.040 --> 03:45.560
<i>I don't know if you remember me,
we worked together, years ago.</i>

03:45.560 --> 03:48.480
<i>Thanks to you,
my wife talked to me last night.</i>

03:48.480 --> 03:50.120
<i>First time in months.</i>

03:50.120 --> 03:52.560
<i>Actual words got spoken.</i>

03:53.800 --> 03:55.600
<i>She had a call from Melinda.</i>

03:55.600 --> 03:57.240
<i>And I asked her questions.</i>

03:57.240 --> 04:00.280
<i>She answered.
It was almost normal.</i>

04:01.600 --> 04:03.520
<i>Lucas...</i>

04:03.520 --> 04:06.720
<i>do you mind telling what happened
to your daughter, Sonia?</i>

04:08.160 --> 04:09.520
<i>Why?</i>

04:09.520 --> 04:12.400
<i>Because I don't think her death
was an accident.</i>

04:16.880 --> 04:20.880
<i>I've been waiting for a long time
for someone to say that.</i>

04:20.880 --> 04:22.880
<i>I've always said it wasn't.</i>

04:22.880 --> 04:25.320
<i>She never took drugs, never.</i>

04:25.320 --> 04:27.680
<i>The police wouldn't take it seriously.</i>

04:27.680 --> 04:30.320
<i>What have you found out?
What exactly happened to her?</i>

04:30.320 --> 04:31.480
<i>Just tell me what you know!</i>

04:31.480 --> 04:33.640
<i>Please, Lucas,
just tell me if you can.</i>

04:36.600 --> 04:39.120
<i>She was in her first year at uni.</i>

04:40.160 --> 04:41.960
<i>She went to a club.</i>

04:41.960 --> 04:43.560
<i>Somebody gave her a drug.</i>

04:45.120 --> 04:47.440
<i>Three weeks in a coma,</i>

04:47.440 --> 04:50.840
<i>she never regained consciousness
and she wasn't going to.</i>

04:51.920 --> 04:55.400
<i>We argued about turning off
her life support.</i>

04:55.400 --> 04:58.480
<i>I wanted to remember her
the way she was, and...</i>

04:58.480 --> 05:00.320
<i>she was beautiful.</i>

05:01.920 --> 05:03.400
<i>LUCAS SNIFFS</i>

05:03.400 --> 05:05.400
<i>Do you know who gave her the drug?</i>

05:06.800 --> 05:09.560
<i>I talked to her friends
who saw her dancing with him.</i>

05:09.560 --> 05:11.000
<i>It was dark, but...</i>

05:11.000 --> 05:14.520
<i>they said he wasn't a student,
he-he was much older than Sonia.</i>

05:14.520 --> 05:16.080
<i>He was older?</i>

05:16.080 --> 05:18.000
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:18.000 --> 05:19.760
<i>Confident and good-looking...</i>

05:19.760 --> 05:22.000
<i>was what they said.</i>

05:22.000 --> 05:23.120
<i>Right.</i>

05:24.480 --> 05:26.800
<i>So what have you found out?</i>

05:27.840 --> 05:29.880
<i>When we worked together</i>

05:29.880 --> 05:35.160
<i>at social services, 13 years ago,
we had a child welfare case.</i>

05:35.160 --> 05:39.520
<i>We accused a man of abusing
his eight-year-old son.</i>

05:39.520 --> 05:40.960
<i>We got it wrong.</i>

05:41.880 --> 05:43.680
<i>The man killed himself.</i>

05:43.680 --> 05:48.120
<i>Now his son has grown up
and taken revenge.</i>

05:49.120 --> 05:50.800
<i>What? It's not your fault,
you didn't...</i>

05:50.800 --> 05:52.640
<i>It wasn't your case,
you did nothing wrong,</i>

05:52.640 --> 05:54.480
<i>you were just helping out,
doing your job.</i>

05:55.640 --> 05:57.080
<i>And he killed Sonia?</i>

05:57.080 --> 06:00.680
<i>I... I think he could be connected
somehow, yeah.</i>

06:00.680 --> 06:03.120
<i>Well, if he...
if he wanted to punish me,</i>

06:03.120 --> 06:04.640
<i>why not hurt me, kill me?</i>

06:06.760 --> 06:08.280
<i>I'm so sorry Lucas.</i>

<i>LUCAS SOBS

<i>I will do everything in my power
to get at the truth.</i>

06:21.680 --> 06:25.400
<i>Whoever gave Sonia that drug,
it wasn't Bobby Morgan.</i>

06:25.400 --> 06:28.120
<i>Did you ever meet Jack Owens?</i>

06:29.800 --> 06:32.880
<i>Lucas could have just described him
to me, it...</i>

06:32.880 --> 06:36.080
<i>Where's just too many coincidences
linking him to Catherine's murder</i>

06:36.080 --> 06:37.680
<i>for him not to be involved.</i>

06:40.440 --> 06:43.560
<i>Mel... I don't want you involved
in this any more.</i>

06:43.560 --> 06:45.800
<i>I don't want the police coming
after you for helping me.</i>

06:45.800 --> 06:47.240

<i>is Bobby Morgan's

<i>from when he was a child,

Morgan and Owens.</i>

12:28.720 --> 12:31.720
<i>They-They knew that I'd touch it,
they knew that I'd move it.</i>

12:31.720 --> 12:35.160
<i>Just pick it up... and come with me!</i>

12:35.160 --> 12:36.400
<i>Listen to me, Detective,</i>

12:36.400 --> 12:39.800
<i>everyone who has worked
on Bobby Morgan's case</i>

12:39.800 --> 12:42.280
<i>has lost somebody
that they've loved.</i>

12:42.280 --> 12:44.240
<i>Now, there's a man,
his name is Rupert Erskine,</i>

12:44.240 --> 12:46.400
<i>he's in danger,
you need to warn him.</i>

12:46.400 --> 12:48.440
<i>His details,
everything is in that file.</i>

12:48.440 --> 12:51.080
<i>I've tried to contact him,
I can't get him.</i>

12:52.640 --> 12:53.960
<i>What?</i>

12:55.240 --> 12:57.200
<i>Erskine's dead.</i>

12:58.440 --> 13:00.560
<i>Erskine is dead.</i>

13:01.760 --> 13:03.640
<i>How? When?</i>

13:03.640 --> 13:06.520
<i>I need to take you into custody,
you'll be safe there.</i>

13:06.520 --> 13:08.800
<i>No, that's not gonna work.
That's not gonna stop them,</i>

13:08.800 --> 13:10.760
<i>they're gonna go after Julianne
and Charlie.</i>

13:10.760 --> 13:13.360
<i>I've told you, we're at your house,
your family are safe.</i>

13:13.360 --> 13:15.720
<i>I'll contact you when you've read
the evidence, all right?</i>

13:15.720 --> 13:17.680
<i>Look, I've come out on a limb
for you.</i>

13:17.680 --> 13:20.680
<i>I've heard your side of it!
Detective, look at the evidence!</i>

13:39.440 --> 13:41.080
<i>Big breaths, Detective.</i>

13:41.080 --> 13:43.000
<i>Big deep breaths.</i>

13:43.000 --> 13:45.240
<i>Come on, you got this.</i>

13:45.240 --> 13:46.760
<i>I can't move.</i>

13:46.760 --> 13:50.400
<i>You can.
Take a step, keep breathing.</i>

13:50.400 --> 13:52.600
<i>That's good, you're nearly there.</i>

13:52.600 --> 13:55.880
<i>Yep, last bit.</i>

13:55.880 --> 13:57.600
<i>Good job.</i>

14:18.800 --> 14:20.520
<i>Sir!</i>

14:20.520 --> 14:22.040
<i>We located the car,</i>

14:22.040 --> 14:24.960
<i>O'Loughlin dumped it near
the City Of Westminster Hospital.</i>

14:29.720 --> 14:31.240
<i>Got him!</i>

14:32.520 --> 14:35.360
<i>40 minutes ago,
on top of the hospital roof.</i>

14:38.640 --> 14:40.760
<i>He met with someone.</i>

14:41.800 --> 14:43.720
<i>No need to search for an ID.</i>

14:45.960 --> 14:47.800
<i>Yeah, that's me.</i>

14:49.600 --> 14:50.960
<i>HE EXHALES DEEPLY</i>

14:50.960 --> 14:52.800
<i>KNOCKING AT DOOR</i>

14:54.880 --> 14:56.080
<i>Hey!</i>

14:57.680 --> 15:00.920
<i>Look, I know...
I know I've been stupid,</i>

15:00.920 --> 15:04.840
<i>beyond stupid,
some might even say uber stupid.</i>

15:04.840 --> 15:07.000
<i>Yes, you have, Jack.</i>

15:08.400 --> 15:10.080
<i>I just...</i>

15:10.080 --> 15:11.760
<i>I can't leave it...</i>

15:11.760 --> 15:13.920
<i>like this between us.</i>

15:15.680 --> 15:18.640
<i>I don't see how things between you
and Joe are ever gonna get repaired.</i>

15:18.640 --> 15:20.520
<i>I literally don't know
what else I can do!</i>

15:20.520 --> 15:22.640
<i>You saw.
I went straight to the police,</i>

15:22.640 --> 15:25.320
<i>I clarified everything about me
and Catherine and the journal,</i>

15:25.320 --> 15:28.960
<i>I pleaded his innocence,
for the second time.</i>

15:28.960 --> 15:32.760
<i>I don't know how you stay
so loyal to him,</i>

15:32.760 --> 15:35.920
<i>given everything he's put you
through, all the lies.</i>

15:35.920 --> 15:39.040
<i>The prostitute... I just... It...</i>

15:43.400 --> 15:46.800
<i>It just doesn't seem fair.</i>

15:46.800 --> 15:48.440
<i>You know, this...</i>

15:48.440 --> 15:50.960
<i>this idea of-of banishment,</i>

15:50.960 --> 15:54.400
<i>of-of never being able to...
to see you again.</i>

15:59.440 --> 16:02.200
<i>I... Oh, God, no!</i>

16:02.200 --> 16:04.080
<i>Jesus!</i>

16:04.080 --> 16:05.800
<i>Jack!</i>

16:05.800 --> 16:07.280
<i>SHE EXHALES DEEPLY</i>

16:07.280 --> 16:09.280
<i>Joe's right about you.</i>

16:09.280 --> 16:12.600
<i>You are too screwed up to maintain
a relationship of your own,</i>

16:12.600 --> 16:14.800
<i>so you try to take over
other people's.</i>

16:14.800 --> 16:18.600
<i>It was never a choice
between Joe or you.</i>

16:18.600 --> 16:20.600
<i>Never. Ever.</i>

16:20.600 --> 16:24.200
<i>He didn't steal me from you.
I never even noticed you were there.</i>

16:24.200 --> 16:25.880
<i>Everything all right,
Mrs O'Loughlin?</i>

16:25.880 --> 16:27.960
<i>Yes, thank you, DJ.</i>

16:27.960 --> 16:29.960
<i>We're fine. Thank you.</i>

16:33.240 --> 16:34.480
<i>Do you mind?</i>

16:34.480 --> 16:35.920
<i>Jack!</i>

16:35.920 --> 16:37.800
<i>Please leave.</i>

16:41.080 --> 16:42.720
<i>Just go.</i>

16:53.880 --> 16:55.280
<i>Are you done?</i>

16:57.760 --> 17:00.240
<i>Yeah, everything's up and running,
so, I'll, er...</i>

17:01.360 --> 17:04.280
<i>I'll be back with a lad to help me
clear away and load up the van.</i>

17:04.280 --> 17:05.960
<i>Great.</i>

17:12.040 --> 17:14.520
<i>DISTANT SIRENS WAIL</i>

17:15.680 --> 17:18.160
<i>Bobby! Bobby, pay attention.</i>

17:18.160 --> 17:19.360
<i>The judges don't like it</i>

17:19.360 --> 17:22.040
<i>when the guilty don't pay them
enough attention, all right?</i>

17:23.000 --> 17:24.840
<i>And remember, when you're in court,</i>

17:24.840 --> 17:26.920
<i>you are like putty
in everyone's hands.</i>

17:26.920 --> 17:29.040
<i>They'll have read your
"I'm really, really sorry</i>

17:29.040 --> 17:31.240
<i>"for hitting that nice lady"
statement,</i>

17:31.240 --> 17:33.680
<i>and I'll argue diminished responsibility.</i>

17:33.680 --> 17:35.360
<i>It might stick.</i>

17:37.360 --> 17:39.720
<i>But she'll more than likely want
to send you to jail</i>

17:39.720 --> 17:42.880
<i>for a couple of months.
She's a bit like that.</i>

17:42.880 --> 17:45.800
<i>So... what are you?</i>

17:47.800 --> 17:51.200
<i>Like putty, Eddie, that's what I am.</i>

17:51.200 --> 17:52.840
<i>Good man.</i>

18:05.720 --> 18:07.800
<i>How we doing?</i>

18:07.800 --> 18:09.760
<i>No trace of him.</i>

18:11.400 --> 18:15.200
<i>We're still ploughing through
O'Loughlin's "evidence".</i>

18:16.600 --> 18:18.040
<i>Listen...</i>

18:23.040 --> 18:25.880
<i>I know I made a bad call
on that roof...</i>

18:25.880 --> 18:28.520
<i>I just don't understand
why you went on your own.</i>

18:28.520 --> 18:31.120
<i>Well, you know, I...
I thought I could bring him in.</i>

18:31.120 --> 18:35.080
<i>I didn't know he'd be on a roof
or that he'd worked out...</i>

18:37.320 --> 18:39.280
<i>I have a fear of heights.</i>

18:40.960 --> 18:43.000
<i>But this information
that he's given us,</i>

18:43.000 --> 18:44.640
<i>we've gotta treat it seriously.</i>

18:46.000 --> 18:47.800
<i>I phoned forensics,</i>

18:47.800 --> 18:51.040
<i>they've got his finger prints
all over that spade that we found.</i>

18:51.040 --> 18:54.800
<i>That is him guilty, Sir.</i>

18:54.800 --> 18:57.120
<i>I'll need to see the full report.</i>

18:59.040 --> 19:02.200
<i>Well, I think we're wasting time
looking at his "evidence".</i>

19:02.200 --> 19:04.520
<i>He's got us running round
in circles again.</i>

19:04.520 --> 19:06.760
<i>We can't ignore
what O'Loughlin's given us.</i>

19:06.760 --> 19:08.280
<i>We need to look at everything,</i>

19:08.280 --> 19:11.840
<i>even if it's so's that
we don't trip up in court, right?</i>

19:11.840 --> 19:14.800
<i>Now, it's not
in O'Loughlin's dossier,</i>

19:14.800 --> 19:18.160
<i>but Judge John Bryant
made the judgement on Lenny Morgan</i>

19:18.160 --> 19:19.920
<i>being barred from seeing his son.</i>

19:19.920 --> 19:22.000
<i>Find out if anything happened to him</i>

19:22.000 --> 19:24.160
<i>or any of his family.</i>

19:24.160 --> 19:25.600
<i>OK?</i>

19:27.440 --> 19:29.080
<i>Thank you.</i>

19:31.960 --> 19:33.800
<i>You're with me.</i>

19:33.800 --> 19:36.080
<i>I've got an idea
where O'Loughlin is.</i>

19:45.160 --> 19:48.600
<i>Oh, er... you are lucky, Bobby.</i>

19:48.600 --> 19:50.080
<i>Very lucky.</i>

19:50.080 --> 19:52.120
<i>I think the psych report swung it
for you.</i>

19:52.120 --> 19:54.680
<i>Now, understand
that probation doesn't mean</i>

19:54.680 --> 19:56.720
<i>you just get to walk away,
all right?</i>

19:56.720 --> 19:59.560
<i>You gotta follow the rules
and do what you're... told.</i>

19:59.560 --> 20:01.480
<i>Yeah, you're welcome.</i>

20:19.040 --> 20:20.800
<i>So, you got off with probation,
then?</i>

20:20.800 --> 20:24.080
<i>Lucky man!
I have nothing to say to you, Joe.</i>

20:24.080 --> 20:26.680
<i>They're gonna investigate
those murders. Oh, my God.</i>

20:26.680 --> 20:29.160
<i>You're not gonna have an alibi
for all of them. What murders?</i>

20:29.160 --> 20:31.320
<i>The revenge killings!
I have no idea what you're...</i>

20:31.320 --> 20:32.960
<i>Whatever.
For what happened to Lenny.</i>

20:32.960 --> 20:35.720
<i>He never was a good dad, was he?
Nah, you were wrong about him.</i>

20:35.720 --> 20:38.520
<i>He was a weak man. A weak man!</i>

20:38.520 --> 20:40.520
<i>Weak! You don't know
what you're talking about!</i>

20:40.520 --> 20:41.960
<i>He took the easy way out!
Hey!</i>

20:41.960 --> 20:43.520
<i>Hit me!
You know nothing!</i>

20:43.520 --> 20:46.320
<i>I am arresting you on suspicion
of the murders of Catherine McCain</i>

20:46.320 --> 20:48.040
<i>and Cara Velasco.
He's a dangerous man!</i>

20:48.040 --> 20:50.360
<i>You do not have to say anything.
It may harm your defence</i>

20:50.360 --> 20:52.040
<i>if you do not mention
when questioned</i>

20:52.040 --> 20:53.760
<i>something which you rely on
in court.</i>

20:53.760 --> 20:55.600
<i>Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.</i>

20:55.600 --> 20:57.120
<i>Have you looked
at the evidence yet?</i>

20:57.120 --> 20:59.200
<i>Don't let him go this time,
he'll hurt me. Please.</i>

20:59.200 --> 21:01.000
<i>Bobby, please calm down.
He's dangerous!</i>

21:01.000 --> 21:03.760
<i>Take him to his hostel,
have an FLO make sure he's OK.</i>

21:03.760 --> 21:06.080
<i>He's a dangerous man.
You're not gonna let him walk off?</i>

21:06.080 --> 21:08.160
<i>Thank you. He's the one
you should be arresting.</i>

21:08.160 --> 21:09.600
<i>No, no. Enough!</i>

21:09.600 --> 21:11.400
<i>Come on, Bobby.</i>

21:12.480 --> 21:14.640
<i>He threatened me, he did. Bobby.</i>

21:19.200 --> 21:20.920
<i>This is me.</i>

21:20.920 --> 21:22.440
<i>I'll be just out here.</i>

21:31.000 --> 21:32.480
<i>So, you lied to us</i>

21:32.480 --> 21:35.600
<i>about returning home the night
Catherine McCain was murdered.</i>

21:35.600 --> 21:38.560
<i>It wasn't "around midnight",
it was around 4am.</i>

21:38.560 --> 21:40.200
<i>Yeah.
Detective Inspector,</i>

21:40.200 --> 21:42.680
<i>my client has made a clear
and honest statement</i>

21:42.680 --> 21:44.600
<i>about the one lie
that he has told you,</i>

21:44.600 --> 21:46.280
<i>he was trying to protect his...</i>

21:46.280 --> 21:50.080
<i>So, now you want us to believe
that you were with Cara Velasco</i>

21:50.080 --> 21:53.680
<i>between 11pm and 3:30
the following morning?</i>

21:53.680 --> 21:56.000
<i>Because I was.
Well, conveniently for you,</i>

21:56.000 --> 21:58.040
<i>she can't refute that claim,
can she?</i>

21:58.040 --> 21:59.960
<i>And you were seen running away
from her flat</i>

21:59.960 --> 22:01.600
<i>the evening that she was murdered.</i>

22:01.600 --> 22:04.480
<i>I got to Cara's flat,
the door was busted open,</i>

22:04.480 --> 22:07.400
<i>I saw her laying on the floor, strangled.</i>

22:07.400 --> 22:08.640
<i>So, why didn't you call us?</i>

22:11.000 --> 22:13.680
<i>I was already being set up
for Catherine's murder,</i>

22:13.680 --> 22:16.200
<i>and you did nothing to help me,
why would I call you?</i>

22:16.200 --> 22:17.880
<i>And you stole Cara's car.</i>

22:17.880 --> 22:19.480
<i>HE SIGHS
Yeah, I stole her car.</i>

22:19.480 --> 22:22.600
<i>Oh, please, tell me you have
looked at the evidence by now,</i>

22:22.600 --> 22:26.280
<i>you must have seen that I have
no connection to these murders!</i>

22:26.280 --> 22:28.160
<i>Murders to punish
my former colleagues,</i>

22:28.160 --> 22:30.560
<i>what are you on about?
We're not connecting you to them.</i>

22:30.560 --> 22:31.920
<i>You're a suspect in the murders</i>

22:31.920 --> 22:33.640
<i>of Catherine McCain
and Cara Velasco.</i>

22:33.640 --> 22:37.960
<i>Yeah, but it's all linked, isn't it?
No, we're not convinced by that.</i>

22:37.960 --> 22:40.600
<i>You and others making
an error of judgement,</i>

22:40.600 --> 22:41.920
<i>all those years ago,</i>

22:41.920 --> 22:43.680
<i>and an understandable error</i>

22:43.680 --> 22:46.520
<i>in an overworked social services
department?</i>

22:46.520 --> 22:49.480
<i>And the enormity of the punishment
you say that's been inflicted?</i>

22:49.480 --> 22:51.120
<i>I don't know,
it doesn't make sense.</i>

22:51.120 --> 22:53.240
<i>No, it doesn't make any sense
to me either.</i>

22:53.240 --> 22:54.800
<i>I absolutely agree with you.</i>

22:54.800 --> 22:57.280
<i>It's excessive beyond all reason.</i>

22:57.280 --> 23:01.880
<i>Something dark, and-and terrible
must have happened to that child.</i>

23:03.320 --> 23:06.920
<i>It's always about childhood,
is it, with you psychologists?</i>

23:06.920 --> 23:08.240
<i>Yeah.</i>

23:08.240 --> 23:12.080
<i>Yeah, it is.
It is always about childhood.</i>

23:12.080 --> 23:14.120
<i>No child is ever born cruel.</i>

23:14.120 --> 23:15.640
<i>Cruelty is learnt.</i>

23:17.800 --> 23:20.240
<i>And then hurt dishes out hurt.</i>

23:22.480 --> 23:24.360
<i>And how's Dr Owens involved?</i>

23:24.360 --> 23:27.040
<i>He's the only person
that I can think of</i>

23:27.040 --> 23:30.400
<i>who fits the description of the man
who drugged Sonia Dutton.</i>

23:30.400 --> 23:31.480
<i>PHONE BUZZES</i>

23:31.480 --> 23:33.560
<i>And he lied to you
about his affair with Catherine</i>

23:33.560 --> 23:35.800
<i>to make me look guilty,
and to-to damage my marriage.</i>

23:35.800 --> 23:37.200
<i>Does that not count for anything?</i>

23:37.200 --> 23:38.840
<i>Sir?</i>

23:38.840 --> 23:40.280
<i>Can we take a break?</i>

23:41.480 --> 23:44.120
<i>Yes.
Interview terminated.</i>

23:47.040 --> 23:49.040
<i>We just heard back
from Judge Bryant,</i>

23:49.040 --> 23:51.720
<i>the guy who signed
the court order on Morgan's dad.</i>

23:51.720 --> 23:54.840
<i>His wife broke her neck
in a riding accident.</i>

23:54.840 --> 23:57.480
<i>A car swerved into the path
of her horse.</i>

23:57.480 --> 23:59.520
<i>When?
Eight months ago.</i>

24:00.960 --> 24:03.160
<i>The driver didn't stop,
but there was a witness,</i>

24:03.160 --> 24:05.160
<i>and they thought it was deliberate.</i>

24:06.440 --> 24:07.720
<i>She gave a description.</i>

24:07.720 --> 24:10.480
<i>It matches that of the man
that drugged Sonia Dutton.</i>

24:12.880 --> 24:16.200
<i>But the link between these murders,
even if they are punishments,</i>

24:16.200 --> 24:18.840
<i>O'Loughlin hasn't been punished
in the same way,</i>

24:18.840 --> 24:20.920
<i>being set up for murder
doesn't fit the pattern</i>

24:20.920 --> 24:23.080
<i>of having someone you love
taken away from you.</i>

24:23.080 --> 24:26.080
<i>So, what makes O'Loughlin
different to the others?</i>

24:26.080 --> 24:28.200
<i>Why set him up for two murders?</i>

24:28.200 --> 24:29.920
<i>He was hardly connected to the case.</i>

24:29.920 --> 24:31.400
<i>But he signed the court report.</i>

24:31.400 --> 24:34.640
<i>If Morgan saw the file,
if he saw O'Loughlin's signature,</i>

24:34.640 --> 24:38.320
<i>that might make O'Loughlin more
culpable in Morgan's eyes, right?</i>

24:39.360 --> 24:41.800
<i>Has anything come from forensics
for me?</i>

24:41.800 --> 24:43.560
<i>Ah, yes, just now, sir.</i>

24:54.920 --> 24:57.280
<i>So, you said that you found a spade</i>

24:57.280 --> 25:00.240
<i>leant against your mother's
gravestone?</i>

25:00.240 --> 25:01.600
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:02.520 --> 25:04.520
<i>I just picked it up and moved it.</i>

25:05.560 --> 25:06.880
<i>How?</i>

25:08.240 --> 25:10.880
<i>I just picked it up and moved it.</i>

25:10.880 --> 25:12.920
<i>With one hand?</i>

25:14.080 --> 25:16.240
<i>Yeah. Over to the path.</i>

25:17.320 --> 25:18.800
<i>Yeah...</i>

25:18.800 --> 25:20.240
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:21.800 --> 25:24.880
<i>See, you being set up...</i>

25:24.880 --> 25:27.320
<i>you know what tips me
into believing it?</i>

25:30.520 --> 25:32.120
<i>I'm not a lucky man.</i>

25:33.680 --> 25:36.760
<i>God knows I've never been
a lucky cop.</i>

25:37.880 --> 25:39.880
<i>But the spade
that buried Catherine McCain,</i>

25:39.880 --> 25:41.320
<i>turning up at just the right time,</i>

25:41.320 --> 25:44.000
<i>the one piece of evidence
that nails you?</i>

25:44.000 --> 25:46.560
<i>I never get evidence like that,
ever!</i>

25:46.560 --> 25:49.840
<i>What? Just when I need it?
Nah. No, that's not me.</i>

25:52.080 --> 25:55.040
<i>Whoever it is,
they pushed it too far.</i>

25:55.040 --> 25:57.800
<i>And, you know, I had forensics
take a look at your prints.</i>

25:57.800 --> 25:59.480
<i>And you did only use one hand.</i>

26:00.520 --> 26:01.680
<i>And, on reflection,</i>

26:01.680 --> 26:05.200
<i>the prints were too good to have
been under leaves for two weeks.</i>

26:05.200 --> 26:09.120
<i>The spade was carefully stored
and... planted.</i>

26:09.120 --> 26:12.160
<i>And you don't dig a grave
with one hand, right?</i>

26:13.200 --> 26:14.720
<i>So...</i>

26:16.160 --> 26:19.120
<i>...and I can't believe
I'm gonna say this, but...</i>

26:19.120 --> 26:20.960
<i>we're back to where we started,</i>

26:20.960 --> 26:23.680
<i>which is asking

<i>No, this isn't about some
stupid mistake I made, Bobby.</i>

37:08.880 --> 37:10.480
<i>Oh, no.</i>

37:11.520 --> 37:13.200
<i>This is about a young boy,</i>

37:13.200 --> 37:16.880
<i>eight years old,
having to suppress a justified rage</i>

37:16.880 --> 37:18.480
<i>at what's happening to him,</i>

37:18.480 --> 37:20.360
<i>and then him denying it
later in life.</i>

37:20.360 --> 37:22.480
<i>That's what this...
"Justified rage", yeah?</i>

37:22.480 --> 37:25.120
<i>Yeah.
Psycho-blah-blah-blah.</i>

37:25.120 --> 37:27.840
<i>Yeah, that's all you ever do,
is chat bin, Joe.</i>

37:27.840 --> 37:30.440
<i>BOBBY GRUMBLES
You're not even close, man.</i>

37:31.440 --> 37:33.560
<i>You got no idea
what I want through, man.</i>

37:33.560 --> 37:35.000
<i>Why don't you tell me, then?</i>

37:36.560 --> 37:37.760
<i>You want me to tell, yeah?</i>

37:37.760 --> 37:39.240
<i>Yeah.</i>

37:40.920 --> 37:42.240
<i>BOBBY GRUNTS</i>

37:44.280 --> 37:47.040
<i>There's a lay-by, yeah?</i>

37:47.040 --> 37:49.760
<i>On the coast road through Cosby, about...</i>

37:49.760 --> 37:52.600
<i>eight miles north of Liverpool,
it is. Bobby!</i>

37:52.600 --> 37:55.360
<i>Just set back from the road,
so you can't really see it. Don't!</i>

37:55.360 --> 37:57.760
<i>See, if you get there about...</i>

37:57.760 --> 38:00.840
<i>about ten, half ten at like...
It's not worth it, mate!</i>

38:00.840 --> 38:02.680
<i>You'll see another car parked there.</i>

38:05.240 --> 38:08.840
<i>And what you do is, yeah,
you pull in behind that car.</i>

38:08.840 --> 38:11.400
<i>You flash an indicator,
left or right...</i>

38:11.400 --> 38:13.840
<i>depending on what you want.</i>

38:13.840 --> 38:16.880
<i>Wait for that car to reply
with the same indicator,</i>

38:16.880 --> 38:18.160
<i>then you follow it.</i>

38:20.360 --> 38:22.440
<i>Now, I was six, lad.</i>

38:24.240 --> 38:27.480
<i>I was six when my mum
first took me to that lay-by.</i>

38:28.920 --> 38:30.720
<i>I had to sit there, Joe.</i>

38:31.840 --> 38:34.400
<i>I had to sit there and watch it all, man.</i>

38:35.400 --> 38:36.920
<i>All of it.</i>

38:36.920 --> 38:39.120
<i>My ma used to say to me...</i>

38:40.160 --> 38:43.040
<i>..."I love it when you watch, lad."
Come on, mate! That's enough!</i>

38:43.040 --> 38:45.360
<i>Do you know what she used
to do to them, yeah?</i>

38:45.360 --> 38:46.840
<i>And what they used to do to her?</i>

38:46.840 --> 38:49.520
<i>Nothing was off the menu.
She shouldn't have to hear this!</i>

38:49.520 --> 38:51.080
<i>Stop it!
Why? Because she's a kid, DJ?</i>

38:51.080 --> 38:52.680
<i>I was the same age as her, man!</i>

38:52.680 --> 38:54.120
<i>I don't want her hearing it!</i>

38:54.120 --> 38:56.040
<i>Ah, listen to yourself! Eh?</i>

38:56.040 --> 38:58.320
<i>Protecting her
yet you wouldn't lift a finger</i>

38:58.320 --> 39:00.520
<i>to protect me, would you?
Your own blood.</i>

39:03.280 --> 39:04.920
<i>You were there.</i>

39:04.920 --> 39:06.720
<i>You must have been a teenager.</i>

39:09.960 --> 39:11.840
<i>When your mother drove out
of the lay-by,</i>

39:11.840 --> 39:13.120
<i>and she followed that car,</i>

39:13.120 --> 39:14.800
<i>where would you go, Bobby?
Stop it, Joe!</i>

39:14.800 --> 39:18.080
<i>Don't say it! DJ's right!
Not in front of Charlie!</i>

39:19.880 --> 39:23.120
<i>Tell you what happened next, mate,
we used to go to a big barn, yeah?</i>

39:24.720 --> 39:27.840
<i>Sometimes there'd be like
30 or 40 nonces...</i>

39:29.000 --> 39:30.840
<i>...just waiting for us, mate.</i>

39:31.840 --> 39:35.240
<i>Get Charlie out of the room now!
Nah, she stays, DJ, leave her!</i>

39:36.720 --> 39:38.200
<i>Running away again!</i>

39:38.200 --> 39:41.200
<i>We've got him, we don't need them.
Here, come on.</i>

39:41.200 --> 39:42.280
<i>Come on. Mum...</i>

39:42.280 --> 39:43.640
<i>He's always running away!</i>

39:43.640 --> 39:44.960
<i>Go!
Through there, off you go.</i>

39:44.960 --> 39:47.520
<i>Rat man, you know! Rat man!</i>

39:49.240 --> 39:51.400
<i>This way.</i>

39:58.360 --> 40:00.560
<i>You said, "Running away again."</i>

40:03.040 --> 40:04.920
<i>Did DJ run away?</i>

40:06.120 --> 40:08.440
<i>To escape the barn?</i>

40:08.440 --> 40:10.320
<i>And then she made you
take his place?</i>

40:10.320 --> 40:11.560
<i>Is that what happened?</i>

40:11.560 --> 40:15.280
<i>Bobby... is that what happened?</i>

40:17.280 --> 40:19.440
<i>Thanks for letting them go.</i>

40:25.800 --> 40:28.120
<i>The house, its wired to explode.</i>

40:28.120 --> 40:30.520
<i>A gas explosion.
It's on a timer.</i>

40:30.520 --> 40:32.320
<i>How long does it have to run?
I don't know,</i>

40:32.320 --> 40:34.280
<i>I don't know,
but I know you can't stop it.</i>

40:34.280 --> 40:36.440
<i>Joe, he's locked inside there
with them.</i>

40:37.480 --> 40:40.520
<i>GAS HISSING,
TIMER BEEPING</i>

40:41.680 --> 40:43.840
<i>So, after DJ ran away...</i>

40:45.080 --> 40:47.280
<i>...how many years were you forced
into that barn</i>

40:47.280 --> 40:48.400
<i>all on your own, Bobby?</i>

40:48.400 --> 40:51.040
<i>That's enough.
Your time's nearly up.</i>

40:53.720 --> 40:56.400
<i>Bobby has an alibi
for the murders, DJ.</i>

40:57.520 --> 40:58.960
<i>You don't.</i>

41:00.160 --> 41:02.440
<i>I think you did all the killings.</i>

41:03.840 --> 41:06.760
<i>This isn't about revenge, DJ.</i>

41:06.760 --> 41:09.640
<i>This is about forgiveness.</i>

41:09.640 --> 41:13.640
<i>You need Bobby to forgive you.</i>

41:15.520 --> 41:17.880
<i>You should have saved him
from that barn.</i>

41:19.640 --> 41:21.280
<i>Just like you saved my family.</i>

41:23.280 --> 41:26.000
<i>You thought that
if you carried out his plan...</i>

41:27.480 --> 41:29.680
<i>...that he'd forgive you for it.</i>

41:32.560 --> 41:34.480
<i>JOE SIGHS</i>

41:34.480 --> 41:38.040
<i>Did you ever really think
that he was gonna forgive you</i>

41:38.040 --> 41:40.160
<i>for running out on him like that?</i>

41:43.960 --> 41:45.720
<i>Of course I have, eh?</i>

41:47.000 --> 41:48.760
<i>I love you, brother.</i>

41:52.840 --> 41:54.640
<i>I love you.</i>

42:02.520 --> 42:04.400
<i>What are you doing?</i>

42:04.400 --> 42:07.760
<i>Come on!
We need to keep him close,</i>

42:07.760 --> 42:10.360
<i>so they don't shoot at us. No.</i>

42:10.360 --> 42:13.200
<i>No, no, we see this through.
You promised me that, yeah?</i>

42:13.200 --> 42:15.400
<i>You haven't killed anyone, have you?
Please! Please.</i>

42:15.400 --> 42:16.960
<i>You just tell 'em
it was all my idea.</i>

42:16.960 --> 42:18.040
<i>No.</i>

42:18.040 --> 42:20.400
<i>You want me to save you?</i>

42:20.400 --> 42:21.480
<i>Yeah?</i>

42:21.480 --> 42:23.920
<i>Like I didn't do back then?</i>
