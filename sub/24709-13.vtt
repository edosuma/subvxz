10:35.885 --> 10:37.887

INVOLVING AN OSTENSIBLE

THE FIRST TWIN'S
IDENTITY

10:41.932 --> 10:45.728
SECURING SEXUAL
RELATIONS, POSSIBLY
INTENDING A HOMICIDE.

10:45.770 --> 10:49.315
NOW, THE SECOND TWIN
HAS AN ADDRESS,
A DRIVER'S LICENSE,

10:49.398 --> 10:51.025
AND A VOICE ON
AN ANSWERING MACHINE,

10:51.067 --> 10:53.402
BUT THE VOICE SOUNDS
LIKE THE FIRST TWIN
THAT COME IN,

10:53.444 --> 10:55.863
AND THE PSYCHIATRIST
THAT THE FIRST TWIN SAID

10:55.905 --> 10:58.199
WOULD VERIFY THE SECOND
TWIN WAS A MENACE,

10:58.240 --> 11:00.201
HE SAYS HE'S NEVER
SEEN THE SECOND TWIN.

11:00.242 --> 11:03.496
WHY WOULD HE IF IT'S
THE FIRST TWIN THAT'S
HIS PATIENT?

11:03.579 --> 11:05.498
BECAUSE ACCORDING
TO THE PSYCHIATRIST

11:05.581 --> 11:08.668
THE FIRST TWIN HAS
SCHEDULED SEVERAL VISITS
FOR THE SECOND TWIN

11:08.751 --> 11:11.754
TO COME WITH HIM, BUT
THE SECOND TWIN NEVER
SHOWS UP JOINTLY.

11:11.837 --> 11:15.091
HE HAS SHOWN UP FOR
SEVERAL INDIVIDUAL
APPOINTMENTS.

11:15.132 --> 11:18.594
BUT THE PSYCHIATRIST
SAYS HE DON'T KNOW IF
THAT IS THE SECOND TWIN.

11:18.678 --> 11:23.265
ON THE OTHER HAND,
BOTH THE FIRST TWIN
AND HIS SHRINK

11:23.307 --> 11:24.767
SAY THE WOMAN
IS IN DANGER.

11:24.809 --> 11:26.560
AND THE SHRINK SAYS THIS
WOULD ESPECIALLY TRUE

11:26.602 --> 11:28.354
IF THE OTHER TWIN
DON'T EXIST,

11:28.437 --> 11:30.523
BECAUSE THEN
THIS PATRICK WOULD BE
A JEKYLL-AND-HYDE TYPE,

11:30.606 --> 11:32.608
VERGING ON
A HOMICIDAL EPISODE.

11:32.692 --> 11:36.028
THIS WOULD BE A PERFECT
CASE FOR THE HYPOTHETICAL
CRIME SQUAD, MEDAVOY,

11:36.112 --> 11:37.822
WHICH ALSO DON'T EXIST.

11:37.905 --> 11:40.658
WARN THE WOMAN,
THEN PUT YOUR NAME BACK
IN THE CATCHING ORDER.

11:40.741 --> 11:44.537
I'M SEEING THE WOMAN
AT 2:00, THIS, UH,
THIS VIVICA.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.498
I--I--I WAS CONSIDERING
GOING TO THIS PETER'S
APARTMENT, ANDY,

11:47.581 --> 11:49.834
WITHOUT TELLING
PATRICK MY PLAN.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.836
THEN, IF PETER
ANSWERS THE DOOR

11:51.919 --> 11:53.838
WITHOUT PATRICK HAVING
ADVANCED KNOWLEDGE

11:53.921 --> 11:55.715
THAT HE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE THERE,

11:55.798 --> 11:58.259
THAT WOULD TEND TO
CONFIRM THE SECOND TWIN
EXISTS,

11:58.300 --> 12:01.762
WHICH I COULD NAIL DOWN
BY CALLING PATRICK
AT HIS PLACE,

12:01.804 --> 12:05.349
HAVING HIM ANSWER
THE PHONE WHILE I'M
IN PETER'S PRESENCE.

12:05.433 --> 12:08.477
IF I CONFIRM THERE
IS A SEPARATE PETER,

12:08.519 --> 12:09.979
THAT EITHER MAKES
THE FELONY REAL,

12:10.020 --> 12:11.981
SECURING SEX
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES,

12:12.022 --> 12:15.359
OR, IF PETER EXISTS,
BUT HAS HAD NOTHING TO
DO WITH THIS VIVICA,

12:15.443 --> 12:20.489
I.E. PATRICK IS
PROJECTING HOMICIDAL
IMPULSES ONTO HIS TWIN--

12:24.535 --> 12:28.330
I THOUGHT I HAD
THAT COVERED, HOW I--
HOW I DETERMINE THAT.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.673
[DOOR CLOSES]

12:37.757 --> 12:40.050
WHAT ARE YOU
ASKING ME TO DO?

12:40.134 --> 12:42.344
ARE YOU ABLE
TO REACH EDDIE?

12:42.386 --> 12:43.679
NO.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.182
NO, I CAN'T CALL HIM
ON THE PHONE.

12:46.223 --> 12:47.933
HE CARRIES A BEEPER.

12:48.017 --> 12:51.228
AND MANY TIMES
I CALL HIM AND--
AND HE DOESN'T ANSWER.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.689
WELL, MAYBE
HE'D ANSWER TO
A DIFFERENT NUMBER.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.858
MAYBE HE WOULD.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.777
WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO TRY HIS BEEPER NUMBER
FROM HERE,

12:57.860 --> 12:59.028
PUNCH IN A NUMBER
WE GAVE YOU?

12:59.069 --> 13:01.238
WELL, WHAT WOULD I SAY
IF HE CALLS BACK?

13:01.322 --> 13:03.699
I THINK, UH, JUST
BE HONEST WITH EDDIE,

13:03.741 --> 13:05.868
AS FAR AS SAYING
YOU'RE WORRIED FOR HIM,

13:05.910 --> 13:09.705
AND MAYBE IF HE
NEEDS HELP IN SOME WAY,
MAYBE NEEDS SOME MONEY,

13:09.747 --> 13:12.041
THAT YOU'D BE WILLING
TO MEET HIM SOMEWHERE.

13:12.082 --> 13:14.543
DO YOU HAVE A CHILD?

13:14.585 --> 13:16.879
NO.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.339
I GOT A 2-YEAR-OLD.

13:20.174 --> 13:23.594
I ALSO HAD A GROWN SON,
LOST TO VIOLENCE.

13:23.677 --> 13:25.638
IF I COULD HAVE REACHED
INTO HIS LAST SITUATION,

13:25.721 --> 13:27.598
I'D HAVE BEEN GRATEFUL
FOR THE CHANCE.

13:27.681 --> 13:31.393
YOU'RE NOT A MOTHER.

13:31.477 --> 13:34.313
I CARRIED HIM
IN MY BELLY.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.319
I CAN'T CALL MY SON
ON HIS BEEPER.

13:40.402 --> 13:42.613
I JUST CAN'T.

13:56.752 --> 13:58.963
ANY IDEA WHY I'M HERE...
PETER?

13:59.046 --> 14:00.589
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME.

14:00.673 --> 14:04.051
WELL,
YOUR BROTHER PATRICK

14:04.093 --> 14:09.348
ALLEGES YOU'VE
BEEN SEXUALLY INTIMATE
WITH VIVICA CERDAN

14:09.431 --> 14:12.852
WHILE REPRESENTING
YOURSELF AS HIM.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.937
ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT?

14:16.856 --> 14:18.858
I AM NOW.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.609
HAVE YOU DONE WHAT
PATRICK ALLEGES,

14:20.651 --> 14:21.777
PETER?

14:21.861 --> 14:23.821
DID PATRICK COME TO YOU
TO HAVE ME ARRESTED?

14:23.904 --> 14:25.447
YOUR BROTHER
CONSIDERS YOU

14:25.489 --> 14:27.408
A DANGER
TO MS. CERDAN.

14:27.449 --> 14:29.952
HIS OPINION
IS SUPPORTED
PROFESSIONALLY.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.997
WE'VE OPENED A FILE
ON YOU, PETER.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.332
ANY HARM BEFALLING
MS. CERDAN,

14:35.416 --> 14:36.959
THIS IS THE ADDRESS
WE'LL BE COMING TO.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.128
OK. I'M ON NOTICE.

14:39.211 --> 14:42.047
PERHAPS WE SHOULD CALL
PATRICK FROM HERE,

14:42.131 --> 14:43.215
PETER.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.800
GET EVERYONE
ON THE SAME PAGE.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.135
GO AHEAD.

14:46.176 --> 14:47.803
SHALL I DO THAT--

14:47.887 --> 14:51.181
CALL PATRICK FROM HERE
IN YOUR PRESENCE?

14:51.265 --> 14:52.850
SURE.

14:56.395 --> 14:57.813
I'VE GOT THE NUMBER.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.315
IF I CALL,

14:59.356 --> 15:01.150
WILL PATRICK
ANSWER THE PHONE?

15:01.233 --> 15:02.568
I DON'T THINK SO.

15:02.651 --> 15:05.362
HE SAID HE'S GOING SHOPPING
AT BLOOMINGDALE'S.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.580
WHY DID YOU
TELL ME TO CALL?

15:14.663 --> 15:17.166
IT SEEMED LIKE
YOU WANTED TO.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.796
PETER, IS PATRICK
HERE WITH US
IN THIS ROOM

15:22.838 --> 15:24.590
AT THIS MOMENT?

15:25.841 --> 15:27.635
YOU MEAN IN SPIRIT?

15:27.676 --> 15:29.386
IN SPIRIT, IN PERSON--

15:29.470 --> 15:30.846
WHAT HAVE YOU.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.556
HE MIGHT BE HERE,
WHAT HAVE YOU.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.100
ALL RIGHT.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.061
I SEE THE TACK
YOU'RE TAKING.

15:37.144 --> 15:39.271
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET ME
TO EXPLAIN TO YOU

15:39.355 --> 15:41.649
WHETHER I'M ME OR PATRICK
PRETENDING TO BE ME.

15:41.690 --> 15:42.775
RIGHT, DETECTIVE?

15:42.858 --> 15:44.026
IF YOU WILL.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.486
SO YOU CAN TELL THE BOYS
AT THE STATION HOUSE

15:45.527 --> 15:47.237
ABOUT THE GEEK TWINS
YOU RAN ACROSS

15:47.321 --> 15:48.489
OR THE GEEK SCHIZO.

15:48.530 --> 15:52.618
DO NOT BRING
PHYSICAL HARM
TO VIVICA CERDAN.

15:52.701 --> 15:55.120
THAT IS
THE SUBSTANCE OF IT.

15:55.204 --> 15:57.706
AND WITH THAT,
I WISH YOU GOOD DAY.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.208
THE POLICE MANUAL SAY

15:59.291 --> 16:01.377
WHEN DEALING WITH POSSIBLE
TWINS OR LOONIES

16:01.460 --> 16:03.712
TO TALK LIKE IT'S
THE PREVIOUS CENTURY?

16:05.673 --> 16:07.383
NO, SIR,

16:07.466 --> 16:09.468
IT DOES NOT.

16:25.609 --> 16:27.861
IF MY BOSS DECIDES
IT'S APPROPRIATE,

16:27.945 --> 16:29.154
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

16:29.196 --> 16:31.240
AND WE SURE APPRECIATE
YOUR COOPERATING

16:31.323 --> 16:32.825
AT SUCH
A DIFFICULT TIME, SIR.

16:32.908 --> 16:33.993
ALL RIGHT.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.996
HE'S WILLING TO COME IN
AND TALK TO HER,

16:37.079 --> 16:38.998
THE BROTHER
OF THE FIRST DOA,

16:39.039 --> 16:40.249
IF THAT'S THE WAY
YOU WANT TO GO.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.001
YOU KNOW
THAT EITHER WORKS

16:42.084 --> 16:43.460
OR IT BLOWS UP
IN OUR FACES.

16:43.502 --> 16:44.670
SHE DIGS IN AFTER
THE GUY TALKS TO HER.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.755
HER MIND--IT'S US
AGAINST HER.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.590
Diane: HERE'S JILL.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.384
HERE'S THE WAY
TO DO IT.

16:50.467 --> 16:52.845
I AGREE.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.555
HI.
HOW'S IT GOING?

16:54.638 --> 16:58.308
WE APPRECIATE
YOUR COMING IN
A LITTLE EARLY.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.935
WE GOT THE MOTHER
OF AN EDDIE
"THE FLY" GOLOTA,

17:00.019 --> 17:01.895
WHOSE SON'S GOT
A 3-FOOT SHEET
WITH B.C.I.,

17:01.979 --> 17:04.356
AND THAT AN EYEWITNESS
MAKES A PERP

17:04.398 --> 17:06.483
IN A STICKUP HOMICIDE
AT AN ATM.

17:06.525 --> 17:07.985
PROBABLY
ALSO DID ONE
AT ANOTHER ATM

17:08.027 --> 17:09.611
A COUPLE HOURS
BEFORE.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.321
THEY JUST ABOUT
HAD HER MOVED

17:11.363 --> 17:12.823
TILL SHE POINTED OUT

17:12.865 --> 17:14.408
THAT THEY DIDN'T
CARRY EDDIE
IN THEIR BELLIES

17:14.491 --> 17:15.451
OR ANYBODY ELSE.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.536
WANNA GO IN
BY YOURSELF?

17:17.578 --> 17:19.913
HOW ABOUT ME AND DIANE?

17:19.997 --> 17:21.707
SHE'S SAYING A ROSARY
IN THE COFFEE ROOM.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.125
HER NAME'S
GOLOTA, TOO?

17:23.208 --> 17:24.293
ROSEMARY.

17:27.337 --> 17:31.383
NEW P.A.A.'S GOING ON
16 CONSECUTIVE MINUTES

17:31.425 --> 17:33.010
NOT GOING NOWHERE.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.223
MRS. GOLOTA.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.767
THIS IS JILL
KIRKENDALL,

17:39.850 --> 17:41.060
ANOTHER DETECTIVE
IN OUR SQUAD.

17:41.101 --> 17:42.061
HI.

17:42.102 --> 17:44.021
HOW DO YOU DO?

17:44.063 --> 17:46.940
I'M SORRY FOR
THIS DIFFICULTY
YOUR SON'S IN.

17:47.024 --> 17:49.151
WHAT IS YOUR CONNECTION?

17:49.234 --> 17:50.903
I WORK A LATER TOUR,

17:50.944 --> 17:53.280
SO I'LL BE PICKING UP
THE INVESTIGATION.

17:53.363 --> 17:55.949
IS THERE WORD OF OTHER
POSSIBLE SUSPECTS?

17:56.033 --> 17:57.242
I'M AFRAID NOT.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.286
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
MRS. GOLOTA,

17:59.369 --> 18:01.413
THE EYEWITNESS
IDENTIFICATIONS
OF YOUR SON

18:01.455 --> 18:02.915
ARE PRETTY CONCLUSIVE.

18:02.956 --> 18:04.291
THAT'S NOW DEVELOPED?

18:04.374 --> 18:05.918
THAT'S DEVELOPED
NOW, YES.

18:08.128 --> 18:11.423
I HAVE 2 BOYS,
MRS. GOLOTA.

18:11.465 --> 18:12.925
I WORK A LATE TOUR

18:12.966 --> 18:14.468
SO THEY WON'T WAKE UP
IN AN EMPTY APARTMENT.

18:14.551 --> 18:16.929
I GO HOME
AT MY MEAL BREAK

18:16.970 --> 18:18.847
SO I CAN MAKE
THEIR DINNERS
AND BE WITH THEM.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.976
IF EITHER OF THE BOYS
WAS IN ANY KIND
OF TROUBLE,

18:23.060 --> 18:25.521
THE FIRST, STRONGEST
FEELING I'D HAVE

18:25.604 --> 18:27.064
WOULD BE TO WRAP
AROUND THEM,

18:27.106 --> 18:29.942
GET MYSELF BETWEEN THEM
AND WHATEVER DANGER
THEY WERE IN.

18:30.025 --> 18:31.026
YES.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.904
WELL, SOMETIMES
I'D BE WRONG.

18:33.946 --> 18:38.283
SOMETIMES I HAVE TO
LET THEM BE IN PAIN
AT THE DOCTOR'S

18:38.325 --> 18:40.953
AND LET MY OLDEST
WALK THE LITTLE ONE
TO THE BUS STOP,

18:40.994 --> 18:42.871
WHEN I STILL
WANT TO TAKE
BOTH THEIR HANDS.

18:42.955 --> 18:46.667
I KEEP LEARNING
THAT I CAN'T KEEP
PUTTING MYSELF

18:46.750 --> 18:49.837
BETWEEN THEM
AND EVERYTHING
LIFE BRINGS THEM.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.965
I BROUGHT THEM
INTO THIS WORLD,

18:53.006 --> 18:54.925
BUT I CAN'T
LIVE FOR THEM IN IT.

18:57.177 --> 18:59.388
WHATEVER EDDIE HAS
OR HASN'T DONE,

18:59.471 --> 19:02.766
THE NEXT PART OF THIS
NEEDS TO GO ON
BETWEEN HIM AND US,

19:02.808 --> 19:04.810
AND IT SHOULD
HAPPEN HERE
INSTEAD OF THE STREET.

19:04.893 --> 19:07.771
IF IT HAPPENS
IN THE STREET,
MRS. GOLOTA,

19:07.813 --> 19:10.649
NO ONE CAN AFFORD TO
REMEMBER HE'S YOUR SON.

19:15.028 --> 19:16.488
COULD I BE HERE

19:16.530 --> 19:18.991
WHEN YOU WOULD
BE SPEAKING WITH HIM?

19:19.032 --> 19:20.659
IF YOU HELP US
BRING EDDIE IN,

19:20.701 --> 19:22.703
YOU CAN
SPEAK WITH HIM
BEFORE WE DO.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.746
IF YOU HELP US
BRING EDDIE IN

19:24.830 --> 19:28.000
SO WE CAN SPEAK TO HIM
IN THE STATION HOUSE...

19:28.041 --> 19:30.294
I WILL TREAT HIM
AS YOUR SON.

19:31.837 --> 19:35.132
I PROMISE YOU THAT
AS A MOTHER.

19:38.844 --> 19:39.970
ALL RIGHT.

19:45.809 --> 19:48.353
[RINGING]

19:55.569 --> 19:57.779
UH, DR. BERGER?

19:57.863 --> 19:58.947
YES. DETECTIVE MEDAVOY?

19:59.031 --> 20:00.532
THANKS FOR COMING IN.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.743
UM...

20:02.826 --> 20:05.996
UH, WHY DON'T WE
TALK DOWN HERE.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.539
LEAD THE WAY.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.583
FRANKLY, I AM PANTING
TO HEAR YOUR NEWS.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.418
ALL RIGHT.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.299
SO, YOU'VE BEEN
TO PETER'S APARTMENT?

20:17.382 --> 20:18.800
YES, I HAVE.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.219
AND AS YOU KNOW,

20:20.302 --> 20:22.721
I'M ABOUT TO SPEAK
WITH MS. CERDAN

20:22.763 --> 20:26.058
CONCERNING
THE MISREPRESENTATION
OF IDENTITY

20:26.099 --> 20:27.226
WHICH APPEARS
TO HAVE OCCURRED

20:27.267 --> 20:29.228
TO SECURE
HER SEXUAL FAVORS,

20:29.269 --> 20:30.729
AND ALSO
PATRICK'S MISGIVINGS,

20:30.771 --> 20:33.398
AS WELL AS YOUR OWN,
CONCERNING HER SAFETY.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.150
YOU SHOULD
DEFINITELY DO THAT.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.319
DO YOU MIND TELLING ME

20:37.402 --> 20:39.738
WHAT THE APARTMENT
WAS LIKE?

20:39.821 --> 20:41.240
WHAT IT WAS LIKE?

20:41.323 --> 20:43.659
MM-HMM.
PETER'S APARTMENT.

20:43.742 --> 20:47.788
UM...IT WAS, UH,
IT WAS KIND OF BLEAK.

20:47.871 --> 20:49.331
UH, <i>BLEAK.</i>

20:49.414 --> 20:52.167
IN THE SENSE OF
INCOMPLETE?

20:52.251 --> 20:54.044
NO. IT WAS ALL PAINTED
AND EVERYTHING.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.420
NO, NO.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.923
WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT
AS THE RESIDENCE

20:58.006 --> 20:59.925
OF AN INCOMPLETE
PERSONALITY?

21:00.008 --> 21:04.346
ACTUALLY, IT STRUCK ME
LIKE, UH...

21:04.429 --> 21:06.932
A RUNDOWN WAITING ROOM
OF SOME KIND.

21:07.015 --> 21:08.767
OH. <i>WAITING </i>ROOM.

21:08.809 --> 21:11.228
OH, THAT'S MARVELOUS.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.273
ANYWAY, UM...

21:14.314 --> 21:17.401
WHETHER IT WAS PETER
OR PATRICK I WAS TALKING TO,

21:17.442 --> 21:18.944
I PUT HIM ON NOTICE

21:19.027 --> 21:21.363
THAT WE WERE AWARE
OF THE VIVICA SITUATION.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.824
HOW DID PETER REACT?

21:23.907 --> 21:26.868
WELL, HE DIDN'T SEEM
THAT SURPRISED.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.328
NO, NO.
WAS HE COMPLIANT?

21:28.412 --> 21:30.455
HE SEEMED
PRETTY COMPLIANT

21:30.539 --> 21:33.625
AND ALSO, UH...
SORT OF SAD.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.419
<i>SAD.</i>

21:35.460 --> 21:36.503
WONDERFUL.

21:38.046 --> 21:41.967
DOCTOR, MY JOB
DON'T LET US
TAKE A LOT OF TIME

21:42.050 --> 21:44.469
ANTICIPATING CRIMES.

21:44.511 --> 21:48.140
IF I'M GONNA HAVE JUST
THE ONE CONVERSATION
WITH MS. CERDAN,

21:48.181 --> 21:51.059
HOW HARD SHOULD I LAND
ON THE DANGER ASPECT?

21:51.143 --> 21:52.311
I'D LAND PRETTY HARD.

21:52.394 --> 21:54.396
SO YOU FEEL HER LIFE
IS DEFINITELY IN DANGER.

21:54.479 --> 21:55.981
OH, ABSOLUTELY.

21:56.064 --> 21:58.942
THE QUESTION IS--
AT WHOSE HAND?

21:58.984 --> 22:01.153
WE'RE BACK TO
THE PATRICK-PETER
CONUNDRUM.

22:01.236 --> 22:03.989
YES. IS IT
