What are you talking about?

20:20.987 --> 20:24.056
You gave that mouse kid
two Almond Joys.

You double-dropped.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.994

Honestly,
this is easy for me.

normally.

my mask.

I try to pick up social cues
from movies and TV,

20:59.091 --> 21:00.793

to fake my reactions

Like, you know you you see
frogs in a creek sometimes,

21:05.532 --> 21:06.999
and you just want to hit them
with a baseball bat

21:07.033 --> 21:09.602
to see if they'll pop?

21:11.604 --> 21:14.307
