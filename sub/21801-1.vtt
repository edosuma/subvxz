00:55.075 --> 00:56.785
Let us begin...

00:56.866 --> 00:58.701
...my friends...

00:59.313 --> 01:01.182
...at the end.

01:21.196 --> 01:22.733
John?

01:23.663 --> 01:25.209
John!

01:57.195 --> 01:59.017
He left nothing?

01:59.797 --> 02:04.484
No note? If he meant to poison himself,
why would he not at least leave a note?

02:04.564 --> 02:08.905
I fear that the act of burning his papers
bears testament enough to his state of mind.

02:10.628 --> 02:12.949
Mrs. Cree, forgive me...

02:13.029 --> 02:15.922
...I know this is neither
the time nor the place but...

02:16.402 --> 02:19.297
...may I say what an ardent
admirer I am of your work?

02:19.896 --> 02:21.784
I looked in the kitchen, sir.

02:22.563 --> 02:24.384
This was all I could find.

02:26.231 --> 02:30.383
I'm afraid this'll be it. There was
residue in a glass on the nightstand.

02:30.463 --> 02:32.350
It can't have been in there, sir.

02:32.430 --> 02:35.117
His nightly cordial was always
prepared by Mrs. Cree.

02:35.197 --> 02:36.718
Aveline.

02:37.896 --> 02:41.517
You... did not make the drink?

02:42.196 --> 02:46.317
Surely you're not asking me in earnest
if I poisoned my husband?

02:46.397 --> 02:49.317
Sir, believe me, she cannot have done this!

02:49.397 --> 02:51.803
The two of them were in a most
violent dispute yesterday!

02:51.903 --> 02:54.850
Why would she prepare Mr. Cree a nightcap
when they were not on speaking terms?

02:54.930 --> 02:57.591
Aveline, what has possessed you?

02:58.230 --> 03:01.113
Sir, please, allow me to explain.

03:01.193 --> 03:03.216
I'm sorry, Mrs. Cree.

03:03.296 --> 03:05.416
You'll need to do that down at Scotland Yard.

03:11.995 --> 03:16.651
A woman accused of poisoning her husband.

03:17.630 --> 03:20.126
But not just any woman...

03:22.062 --> 03:24.116
...little Lizzie...

03:24.196 --> 03:27.884
...darling of the music halls.

03:29.463 --> 03:31.783
But the city was in thrall...

03:31.863 --> 03:36.685
...with the fearsome Limehouse Golem.

03:37.813 --> 03:39.517
Who was he?

03:39.597 --> 03:42.417
Who would be his next victim?

03:43.596 --> 03:46.183
The Golem had last struck...

03:46.263 --> 03:49.351
...the day before her arrest.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.916
And his was the name...

03:52.996 --> 03:56.034
...on every Londoner's lips.

04:15.030 --> 04:16.916
How many are dead?

04:17.995 --> 04:19.571
Five.

04:19.651 --> 04:24.507
Shopkeeper Mr. Gerrard,
his wife Mary, their maid...

04:24.996 --> 04:27.449
...and the two Gerrard children.

04:29.630 --> 04:33.253
It's not number 29. 29 Ratcliffe Highway?

04:33.333 --> 04:35.820
- What of it?
- The Ratcliffe highway murders?

04:35.900 --> 04:39.407
- John Williams?
- It's a bit before my time.

04:39.487 --> 04:42.562
And mine. It was 70 years ago.

04:44.699 --> 04:47.487
Inspector Roberts! Can you confirm
that this is the work of the Golem?

04:47.567 --> 04:50.454
- What is it about this house?
- Do you think it could be cursed, sir?

04:50.534 --> 04:53.287
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please!

04:53.367 --> 04:57.986
I'd ask you to direct
your requests to my colleague...

04:58.066 --> 05:02.020
...Detective Inspector Kildare.
He's taking over the case.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.953
Kildare? How are you spelling that?

05:04.033 --> 05:05.353
Taking over?

05:05.433 --> 05:09.076
I'm just stepping aside, not stepping down.

05:11.600 --> 05:14.454
The public seeks reassurance, Kildare.

05:14.534 --> 05:17.229
What better way than to give them new blood?

05:19.265 --> 05:22.252
Are you fearful of stepping into
the shoes of the great Mr. Roberts?

05:22.334 --> 05:25.752
How many more people have to die
before the Golem is caught?

05:25.832 --> 05:27.415
Driver!

05:28.200 --> 05:30.036
Detective Roberts!

05:31.800 --> 05:35.220
Inspector Kildare, is it true
that this is your first murder case?

05:35.300 --> 05:37.153
Inspector Kildare!

05:38.100 --> 05:39.853
Move. Move back.

05:39.933 --> 05:41.833
Do you know if they'll be displaying
the bodies today?

05:41.913 --> 05:45.420
Step aside, sir.
The maid was found over there.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.626
Were there footprints when you arrived?
The Golem's prints?

05:47.706 --> 05:50.487
- Half of Limehouse was already here.
- Which of the victims was found there?

05:50.567 --> 05:53.971
None. The Golem moved that one himself.
Either Mr. or Mrs. Gerrard.

05:54.051 --> 05:57.020
More likely him. If the maid was killed
first, he'd investigate the disturbance.

05:57.100 --> 05:59.287
- Where is her body now?
- We took her upstairs, sir.

05:59.367 --> 06:01.460
At least up there we can
keep the hoi poloi out.

06:01.540 --> 06:03.950
- Down here is a lost cause.
- They can't all be reporters.

06:04.030 --> 06:08.619
No. Locals looking for entertainment.
Cheaper than a ticket to a shocker.

06:08.699 --> 06:12.223
Sometimes I suspect if I was dispatched
to hell, I'd barely notice the change...

06:12.303 --> 06:14.966
...bar the weather.
This is Inspector Kildare.

06:15.046 --> 06:17.367
- Taking over from Roberts.
- Sir.

06:18.566 --> 06:22.629
Can you tell this idiot to let me up?
I'm with the <i>Evening Post!</i>

06:32.566 --> 06:34.595
This is the maid?

06:43.299 --> 06:45.120
I'm sorry.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.795
I've never seen anything of this kind.

06:49.532 --> 06:51.561
Neither have I.

07:33.699 --> 07:35.925
"He who observes...

07:36.005 --> 07:40.153
...spills no less blood
than he who inflicts the blow."

07:40.233 --> 07:42.120
Lactantius.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.021
Impressive, sir.

07:45.300 --> 07:47.887
The truth has a habit
of sticking in the mind.

07:48.117 --> 07:49.639
Truth?

07:52.017 --> 07:56.479
Those who fail to prevent injustice
are as guilty as the perpetrator.

07:57.700 --> 07:59.248
It's a message...

08:00.300 --> 08:02.262
...to us.

08:08.396 --> 08:11.653
Evidence... John Cree case.

08:11.933 --> 08:14.887
- The poisoning.
- You've had quite a week.

08:14.967 --> 08:17.429
First the Limehouse Golem, now this.

08:21.532 --> 08:24.287
I heard Inspector Kildare
was asking after you.

08:24.367 --> 08:28.220
Yes. I don't know what he wanted.
I keep missing him.

08:28.300 --> 08:31.720
Well, they did right giving him
the Golem case, I reckon.

08:31.800 --> 08:36.986
He'd have risen well above Roberts by now
if those rumors hadn't done for him.

08:37.067 --> 08:40.419
You know. That he wasn't the marrying kind...

08:43.366 --> 08:44.669
...men.

08:46.165 --> 08:49.602
It's before your time, I suppose.

08:57.899 --> 08:59.339
Come in.

09:01.267 --> 09:05.321
- I got your message, sir.
- I'm being assigned a constable.

09:05.401 --> 09:08.620
I thought someone of your knowledge
of Limehouse might be an asset.

09:08.700 --> 09:11.220
When I heard nothing back, I thought
perhaps the offer didn't appeal.

09:11.300 --> 09:14.020
I came by twice, sir. You were out.

09:14.100 --> 09:17.137
I was at Limehouse. Appealing for witnesses.

09:17.217 --> 09:19.096
To no avail.

09:24.682 --> 09:28.037
- What are you looking for?
- I'm just looking. Trying to understand.

09:28.117 --> 09:30.970
The Golem's a madman.
What else is there to be understood?

09:31.050 --> 09:34.603
Even madness has its own logic.
Here there's none.

09:34.683 --> 09:37.170
At Ratcliffe Highway,
he slaughtered a household.

09:37.250 --> 09:41.303
The previous week, a prostitute.
Alice Stanton. Before that, Solomon Weil.

09:41.383 --> 09:44.246
He was an old man, a scholar.

09:46.682 --> 09:48.536
Oh, my God.

09:48.616 --> 09:51.304
- Is that his...
- Yes.

09:51.383 --> 09:54.673
Laid upon the open pages
of a book on Jewish folklore...

09:54.753 --> 09:56.754
...like a bookmark.

09:57.983 --> 10:01.770
"The Legend of the Golem."
Is that how the press got the name?

10:01.850 --> 10:04.973
- Our murderer obviously approved.
- And who were the first two?

10:05.053 --> 10:08.403
Both women of the streets.
I do remember reading of that one.

10:08.483 --> 10:12.338
- "Old Salty."
- Her name was Jane Quig.

10:13.217 --> 10:15.903
The point is there's no story to any of them.

10:15.983 --> 10:19.337
Men, women, young, old.
Jew and Christian. Rich and poor.

10:19.416 --> 10:22.271
- Perhaps he just likes to kill.
- No.

10:22.750 --> 10:25.536
I'll wager there's a tale being told.

10:25.616 --> 10:29.627
If we can sink to his circle
of damnation to comprehend it.

10:31.083 --> 10:34.663
If I may say, sir, seems you've been
wasted down in theft-and-fraud.

10:34.763 --> 10:38.758
I'll be back there soon enough, if the Golem
strikes again. That seems to be the plan.

10:38.838 --> 10:42.170
- What do you mean?
- The yard is setting me up as a scapegoat.

10:42.250 --> 10:45.670
They'll not risk Roberts,
will they? I'm expendable.

10:45.750 --> 10:49.793
They get to preserve the reputation
of their golden boy and the public...

10:51.983 --> 10:54.870
- ...get blood.
- Well, as I said back in Limehouse...

10:54.950 --> 10:57.503
...seems they never have their fill of that.

10:57.583 --> 11:00.170
"He who spectates." He doesn't mean us.

11:00.250 --> 11:05.503
He means the public. The public
want blood. The Golem provides it.

11:05.583 --> 11:08.636
Yes! I'm sure that must be it, sir.

11:08.716 --> 11:11.188
Are you? I'm not.

11:12.416 --> 11:15.675
Do you feel like a walk... to the library?

11:26.514 --> 11:29.439
That quotation. About the gladiatorial ring?

11:29.519 --> 11:33.370
The guilt of the audience who seek bloodshed?
Well, perhaps you read it elsewhere.

11:33.450 --> 11:36.670
It's quoted in an old piece
by the essayist Thomas de Quincey.

11:36.750 --> 11:39.199
One I imagine might be of interest
to a man in your line of work.

11:39.278 --> 11:41.245
- What's the piece?
- "On murder considered...

11:41.324 --> 11:46.180
...as one of the fine arts." A satire about
the Ratcliffe Highway killings of 1811.

11:48.682 --> 11:51.237
Should we talk with this de Quincey?

11:51.316 --> 11:55.146
He has been dead for 20 years,
Flood, so it might be a bit...

12:04.815 --> 12:06.830
What is it?

12:11.117 --> 12:14.361
<i>Left to rot. To kill a whore.</i>

12:39.315 --> 12:41.037
Who last borrowed this book?

12:41.117 --> 12:43.703
This is a reading room, Inspector,
not a local library.

12:43.783 --> 12:46.970
So nothing leaves the premises?
Do you keep an attendance record?

12:47.050 --> 12:50.737
Of course, but there's no way of knowing
what anyone read or when they read it.

12:50.817 --> 12:53.645
Who was here on September the 24th?

12:56.849 --> 12:59.137
There were four men
in the reading room that day. Why?

12:59.216 --> 13:02.370
It's the final entry in a diary someone
has kept in the pages of this book.

13:02.450 --> 13:04.496
- Were you here yourself?
- I'm here every day.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.553
Then I must ask you for
a sample of your handwriting.

13:06.653 --> 13:10.096
I'll need the same from all the staff.
And those four names, please?

13:11.015 --> 13:12.336
<i>The</i> Dan Leno?

13:12.416 --> 13:15.436
And <i>the</i> Karl Marx and George Gissing.

13:15.516 --> 13:17.900
If you're a follower
of philosophy and literature.

13:17.980 --> 13:20.203
What do you know of John Cree?

13:21.083 --> 13:22.637
Sir?

13:23.017 --> 13:25.824
If he's the same John Cree I'm thinking of...

13:26.850 --> 13:28.445
...I believe he's dead.

13:33.715 --> 13:36.302
Place the diary in my files. Keep it safe.

13:36.382 --> 13:40.369
Find out all you can about George Gissing,
Karl Marx, and Dan Leno.

13:40.449 --> 13:43.202
- Where are you going?
- To investigate the dead man.

13:43.282 --> 13:46.578
If he was the Golem,
London's troubles are over.

13:51.982 --> 13:57.103
And you describe your husband
as being in a state of despair...

13:57.182 --> 14:00.503
...in the weeks leading to his death, yes?

14:00.583 --> 14:03.352
My husband had spent several years
writing a play, Your Honor.

14:03.432 --> 14:05.686
Entitled "Misery Junction."

14:05.766 --> 14:07.970
It was not a success.

14:08.349 --> 14:10.136
I believe he never recovered from that.

14:10.216 --> 14:14.703
And yet he continued to pass
each day in the reading room...

14:14.783 --> 14:18.136
...at the British museum,
reading and writing.

14:18.216 --> 14:20.536
A change in mood and a change
in habit are two different things.

14:20.616 --> 14:25.111
On the day of his death,
the librarian described your husband...

14:25.191 --> 14:28.353
...as being in good spirits.

14:28.483 --> 14:31.336
My husband was adept at presenting
a false face to the world, sir.

14:31.416 --> 14:35.603
And that is something you would understand...

14:35.683 --> 14:38.936
...is it not, Mrs. Cree?

14:39.016 --> 14:40.837
Playing...

14:41.516 --> 14:43.278
...a role?

14:45.016 --> 14:47.403
I used to be a music hall performer,
if that's what you mean.

14:47.483 --> 14:49.970
And what of the role you play
today before this court?

14:50.050 --> 14:54.503
That of a respectable, educated lady.

14:55.082 --> 14:58.370
You were born out of wedlock, were you not?

14:59.050 --> 15:00.903
Yes, sir.

15:01.182 --> 15:05.403
As a child, you stitched sailcloth...

15:06.082 --> 15:10.520
...and passed much time with men.

15:12.950 --> 15:17.119
I can assure you I was
a God-fearing child. An innocent.

15:17.199 --> 15:20.803
<i>I was tasked by my mother
to deliver our sails to the docks.</i>

15:20.883 --> 15:23.436
<i>Encountering men was not something
I could hope to avoid.</i>

15:23.516 --> 15:26.136
- Here you go, good as new.
- Carry that all the way?

15:26.216 --> 15:27.837
Look at your poor hands, Lizzie.

15:27.917 --> 15:30.036
Me ma says I'm made
for the bloodtubs with these hands.

15:30.115 --> 15:34.166
Don't you dare run off and join the theater.
These sails ain't gonna mend themselves.

15:34.246 --> 15:37.930
I like the comics. Charlie's gonna
take me to see Dan Leno one day.

15:38.010 --> 15:40.411
Aren't you, Charlie, when I'm older?

15:52.990 --> 15:56.186
Dan Leno was never that blue.
Did Charlie teach you that?

15:56.266 --> 15:58.736
Just don't let your ma hear it.
She'll kill ya.

15:58.816 --> 16:00.857
What's it mean?

16:01.716 --> 16:03.770
If you want, I'll show you.

16:03.850 --> 16:07.348
Me mum will be wanting me home,
if you'll give me our pay.

16:08.249 --> 16:10.279
Money's in my hut.

16:23.382 --> 16:25.412
What took you so long?

16:33.815 --> 16:35.814
Has a man laid hands on you?

16:36.880 --> 16:38.503
You liar.

16:38.583 --> 16:40.256
I fell.

16:40.336 --> 16:42.238
Come here.

16:44.516 --> 16:47.770
- What did I do wrong?
- Mother, no, please.

16:47.850 --> 16:51.738
- Did I not teach you well enough?
- No, I beg you!

16:53.116 --> 16:54.572
Come here.

17:00.048 --> 17:02.036
You want me to go to heaven, don't you?

17:02.116 --> 17:04.415
That place will keep you from heaven, Lizzie.

17:11.933 --> 17:14.394
That is enough, Mrs. Cree!

17:18.566 --> 17:21.078
Court is adjourned for lunch!

17:28.981 --> 17:32.293
Anyone come by from <i>The Era</i> newspaper?
I'm expecting a package.

17:32.373 --> 17:34.187
No package.

17:35.116 --> 17:36.978
Just this.

17:42.948 --> 17:44.816
John Cree.

17:48.248 --> 17:52.682
No luck getting a sample of Cree's handwriting
from his old employers, I'm afraid, sir.

17:53.049 --> 17:55.470
They don't keep reporters' submissions.

17:55.949 --> 17:57.670
Had a more recent portrait, though.

17:57.750 --> 18:00.369
And I've asked archives for all
the files on Gissing and Marx.

18:00.449 --> 18:03.312
Very good. See if they have anything on Leno.

18:19.682 --> 18:22.737
<i>September the 5th, 1880.</i>

18:23.016 --> 18:25.202
<i>It was a fine bright evening...</i>

18:25.282 --> 18:28.082
<i>...and I could feel a murder coming on.</i>

18:28.582 --> 18:30.936
Since it was to be my first show...

18:31.016 --> 18:34.670
...I decided by way of inspiration
to pay a visit to the site...

18:34.750 --> 18:37.603
...of the immortal Ratcliffe Highway murders.

18:37.882 --> 18:40.469
<i>More than half a century ago
on this sacred spot...</i>

18:40.549 --> 18:43.536
<i>...an entire family
was dispatched into eternity...</i>

18:43.616 --> 18:45.736
<i>...by a man named John Williams...</i>

18:46.015 --> 18:50.486
<i>...a man Thomas de Quincey described
as an artist of exquisite skill.</i>

18:50.566 --> 18:53.603
<i>And yet now the site
of his greatest work was defiled...</i>

18:53.683 --> 18:56.202
<i>...by a seller of secondhand clothes.</i>

18:56.282 --> 18:59.100
We're closed, I'm afraid, sir.

18:59.816 --> 19:03.369
Oh, sorry. The door was open.

19:03.449 --> 19:06.538
No matter. I'll be sure to return.

19:08.216 --> 19:11.374
<i>But I was a beginner, an understudy.</i>

19:11.454 --> 19:14.478
<i>Not yet ready for the great stage.</i>

19:26.981 --> 19:29.936
<i>An artist must perfect his craft...</i>

19:30.016 --> 19:34.269
<i>...and tonight I would start
with a small, private rehearsal.</i>

19:34.349 --> 19:37.052
- Gin?
- Don't you think you've had enough?

19:37.132 --> 19:39.102
I want you awake.

19:39.182 --> 19:41.412
Or else you'll miss all the fun.

20:03.271 --> 20:07.822
<i>I felt that she suspected my game from
the start and offered herself willingly...</i>

20:07.902 --> 20:10.446
<i>...warm in the knowledge that
the world would soon be forced...</i>

20:10.526 --> 20:12.679
<i>...to confront the plight of her kind.</i>

20:20.849 --> 20:24.336
<i>I took out her eyes in case my image
had been imprinted upon them...</i>

20:24.416 --> 20:28.302
<i>...and washed the blood from my hands
with the gin in her chamber pot.</i>

20:28.382 --> 20:30.673
<i>My first performance...</i>

20:31.117 --> 20:32.854
<i>...was complete.</i>

20:53.415 --> 20:57.412
Mrs. Cree? I'm Inspector Kildare
of Scotland Yard.

20:58.449 --> 21:01.061
I suppose you're here to chastise me
for my candor in court.

21:01.141 --> 21:03.440
On the contrary, I applaud you for it.

21:03.520 --> 21:06.636
It's all too easy to imagine that those
who have enjoyed success...

21:06.715 --> 21:09.003
...have never known suffering.

21:09.383 --> 21:12.503
Well, to quote the great
Dan Leno, "Here we are again."

21:12.583 --> 21:16.470
I'm afraid I'm not a frequenter
of the music halls.

21:16.550 --> 21:20.616
He portrays the suffering of women.
My gender becomes inured to injustice.

21:20.695 --> 21:24.789
We expect it. Until we can
greet it merely with a shrug.

21:25.848 --> 21:27.769
I understood he was a comic.

21:27.849 --> 21:30.525
The line between comedy
and tragedy is a fine one.

21:32.383 --> 21:34.562
You haven't told me why you're here.

21:38.381 --> 21:42.122
I wish to put it to you that I know
why you might have had good reason...

21:42.202 --> 21:45.403
- ...to poison your husband.
- Please, sir, I'm hoarse from repetition.

21:45.483 --> 21:47.636
There will be no confession.
My plea has been made.

21:47.715 --> 21:50.836
Mrs. Cree, I'm not assigned to your case.

21:50.916 --> 21:55.503
I'm here because your husband
is a suspect in another matter.

21:55.583 --> 21:57.441
What matter?

21:59.832 --> 22:02.269
A journal has been found.

22:02.349 --> 22:06.570
I'd like to compare the handwriting with his.
Might you have anything that he wrote?

22:06.649 --> 22:08.540
- His papers...
- He burned them, yes.

22:08.620 --> 22:13.236
Mrs. Cree, if your husband were
found to have committed murder...

22:13.715 --> 22:16.256
...your claims of suicide gain weight.

22:16.336 --> 22:19.069
- Do you understand? You could go free.
- Murder?

22:19.149 --> 22:23.236
I'm investigating a series of deaths.
They're calling them the "Limehouse Golem...

22:23.316 --> 22:25.835
You can't honestly think my husband
capable of such things?

22:25.915 --> 22:28.635
It's not my place to have an opinion.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.769
I just follow the threads.

22:30.849 --> 22:33.369
The newspaper said
it was your first murder case.

22:33.449 --> 22:36.472
- That's a rotten kind of chance to be given.
- Excuse me?

22:38.949 --> 22:41.603
I wanted to be a serious actress, you know.

22:41.682 --> 22:45.744
Had my chance once, too.
They don't give you another.

22:48.881 --> 22:50.836
That's why I'd like to help you.

22:51.915 --> 22:56.103
- You needn't feign interest in me.
- There's nothing feigned about it.

22:56.982 --> 23:00.802
Raised in cruelty and yet
you stood tall and thrived.

23:00.882 --> 23:02.437
That's...

23:03.316 --> 23:04.678
...uncommon.

23:09.081 --> 23:12.125
My mother did me
the great service of dying young.

23:16.215 --> 23:18.375
I was raised in the music halls.

24:13.216 --> 24:16.278
- You want to buy some sweets, miss?
- Hey, get out of here.

24:26.415 --> 24:28.102
What?

24:28.182 --> 24:31.278
- What a play.
- It was.

24:45.381 --> 24:48.382
It's halfway over, love. Come back tomorrow.

24:50.515 --> 24:54.386
All right. Go on in.
You can still catch Leno if you're quick.

24:54.466 --> 24:56.345
God bless.

25:30.014 --> 25:32.077
All right, there we go!

25:35.214 --> 25:36.809
What fine manners.

25:36.889 --> 25:40.602
Such fine manners!
I feel as if I'm at a tea party.

25:41.481 --> 25:45.299
Please note the oxtail
in the jelly tonight is three pence.

25:45.379 --> 25:47.936
- Now without any further ado...
- That's for later.

25:48.016 --> 25:50.708
...may I introduce the man of the hour...

25:50.788 --> 25:54.364
...Mr. Dan Leno!

26:02.614 --> 26:05.145
Here we are again!

26:11.948 --> 26:15.713
<i>I burnt both my hands while a-trying</i>

26:15.793 --> 26:18.907
<i>To cook my old man's mutton broth</i>

26:18.987 --> 26:23.598
<i>My fat, boss-eyed baby was crying</i>

26:26.393 --> 26:29.647
<i>I believe she's a little bit off</i>

26:30.414 --> 26:34.497
- Mummy!
- <i>The meat all got burnt to a cinder</i>

26:34.577 --> 26:37.696
<i>Which made my old man very wild</i>

26:37.776 --> 26:41.691
<i>Then he threw the whole lot
through the winder</i>

26:41.771 --> 26:45.380
<i>And smashed me on the nose with the child</i>

26:50.239 --> 26:53.440
<i>And the child began a-screaming</i>

26:53.520 --> 26:56.580
<i>As it never screamed before</i>

26:56.660 --> 27:01.284
<i>While my nose with claret was streaming</i>

27:02.800 --> 27:07.438
<i>He tried to dislocate my jaw</i>

27:09.437 --> 27:13.423
<i>He kicked me and punched me this morning</i>

27:13.503 --> 27:16.155
<i>And made my poor face such a fright</i>

27:16.235 --> 27:19.911
<i>He blacked both my eyes without warning</i>

27:19.991 --> 27:25.317
<i>But I'm waiting for him tonight</i>

27:25.396 --> 27:29.690
<i>He kicked me and punched me this morning</i>

27:29.770 --> 27:32.899
<i>And made my poor face such a fright</i>

27:32.979 --> 27:36.452
<i>He blacked both my eyes without warning</i>

27:36.742 --> 27:42.233
<i>But I'm waiting for him tonight</i>

27:49.814 --> 27:51.378
More!

27:58.748 --> 28:02.101
Pies, pies, pies, pies.
All in dire need of pies.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.936
I'll tell you what, dearie. Seeing
as you're here again, be a good girl.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.922
Give Uncle a hand.

28:07.002 --> 28:09.418
Be careful with that. All too good to drop.

28:09.498 --> 28:11.944
As the pregnant woman said to the midwife!

28:14.281 --> 28:18.197
Here you are, Vic. A little bit
of what you fancy. John John.

28:19.815 --> 28:23.169
Aveline, dear, nice and hot,
just as you like it.

28:23.249 --> 28:25.320
But not quite so big.

28:27.381 --> 28:29.277
Thanks, Uncle.

28:42.947 --> 28:45.301
Last one's for you, Mr. Leno.

28:45.381 --> 28:47.401
Mr. Leno, is it?

28:47.481 --> 28:52.301
Did you find her at the grocers, Uncle?
She's certainly a green one.

28:52.381 --> 28:54.388
Now, now, girls.

28:56.415 --> 28:59.035
- What's your name?
- Lizzie, sir.

28:59.115 --> 29:00.969
Lambeth Marsh Lizzie.

29:01.049 --> 29:03.695
I thought I could smell marsh gas.

29:03.775 --> 29:07.836
Don't let 'em dumb you.
It's just their way. And call me Dan.

29:08.615 --> 29:13.069
This is Tommy Farr, theater manager
and keeper of the Bunce.

29:13.149 --> 29:16.211
Speaking of which, we owe you
something for your trouble.

29:20.815 --> 29:24.452
What in God's name did they have you
doing down there in those marshes?

29:26.448 --> 29:28.335
Digging graves.

29:28.415 --> 29:32.063
Five years it was before I found out
you're supposed to use a shovel.

29:32.782 --> 29:35.602
I like this one. Can you read?

29:35.682 --> 29:38.544
- Like a native.
- Here.

29:44.081 --> 29:48.135
"What's fame?
A fancy'd life in other's breath.

29:48.214 --> 29:51.169
A thing beyond us, even before our death.

29:51.248 --> 29:56.736
All we feel of it begins and ends in
the small circle of our foes and friends."

29:57.415 --> 29:59.342
That's my favorite line.

29:59.782 --> 30:01.603
Alexander Pope.

30:03.381 --> 30:05.369
- Are you looking for work, Lizzie?
- Yeah.

30:05.449 --> 30:09.935
Only, our prompter ran off with a lion
comique. And it won't all be lavender.

30:10.015 --> 30:12.368
There'll be some fetch and carry,
but there's decent Bunce...

30:12.448 --> 30:14.460
...and room in the digs with the dancers.

30:16.748 --> 30:18.103
What do you say?

30:19.381 --> 30:25.368
How would you describe
your relationship with Dan Leno?

30:25.448 --> 30:27.401
We were friends, sir.

30:27.481 --> 30:31.126
And he was my mentor.
He took me under his wing.

30:31.205 --> 30:33.244
"No, Mrs. Killian"...

30:36.448 --> 30:39.702
Where did you learn to read
and write if you didn't go to school?

30:40.181 --> 30:43.591
My mother's Bible, I suppose.

30:45.381 --> 30:47.392
Oh, and speaking of books...

30:48.448 --> 30:51.298
- Oi. Thank you.
- What?

30:51.748 --> 30:55.210
Finished already?
That's the second this week.

30:57.180 --> 30:59.635
I think books might be my first love.

30:59.715 --> 31:03.136
And I've always heard it said
that first love is insatiable.

31:04.215 --> 31:08.725
Sod writing new gags, they can have
the milkmaid again tonight and like it.

31:09.015 --> 31:10.743
I want to show you something.

31:12.281 --> 31:14.417
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

31:18.081 --> 31:19.969
A whole room?

31:20.248 --> 31:22.101
Full of books?

31:22.581 --> 31:24.677
Every inch of it.

31:27.247 --> 31:28.635
People come here just to read?

31:28.715 --> 31:32.335
To read. To learn. To create.

31:32.615 --> 31:35.535
It's like... a great furnace.

31:35.615 --> 31:38.902
I mean, the future is being forged here.

31:38.982 --> 31:42.962
Writers, philosophers, men of science.

31:43.042 --> 31:45.969
All the way down to lowly clowns like me.

31:46.049 --> 31:48.169
The ladies' table is upstairs.

31:49.548 --> 31:52.368
Thanking you kindly, good sir.

31:52.448 --> 31:54.802
You were never more than friends?

31:54.882 --> 31:58.386
No, sir. I believe he felt protective of me.

31:59.882 --> 32:04.368
The prosecution wishes to remind the court
that Mr. Leno was recently questioned...

32:04.448 --> 32:08.168
...in connection with
the "Limehouse Golem" murders.

32:08.248 --> 32:09.964
Objection, Your Honor!

32:10.049 --> 32:12.264
Order, order!

32:15.982 --> 32:17.635
Inspector Kildare!

32:17.715 --> 32:19.344
Kildare!

32:28.948 --> 32:32.802
Why was I not aware
that Dan Leno was previously a suspect?

32:32.882 --> 32:36.438
You tell me, Kildare.
It was in every daily newspaper.

32:36.518 --> 32:39.135
But not in the brief you gave me.

32:39.215 --> 32:43.002
Well, he was eliminated from inquiries.
The report's on my desk somewhere.

32:43.081 --> 32:45.903
You didn't think to place it in your files?

32:46.682 --> 32:49.581
The streets of London run red with blood...

32:49.661 --> 32:52.142
...and you concern yourself with paperwork?

32:53.815 --> 32:56.535
You'd have made a fine politician, Kildare...

32:56.615 --> 32:58.783
...were you not the topic of such...

32:59.682 --> 33:01.244
...speculation.

33:06.548 --> 33:10.501
I wouldn't read that.
Disgraceful lies, all of it.

33:10.581 --> 33:14.605
The poor woman spoke of misfortune and
cruelty and they've turned it upon her.

33:14.685 --> 33:16.864
Makes my blood boil.

33:18.749 --> 33:21.268
Seems your beloved Leno
wasn't actually a suspect.

33:21.348 --> 33:24.355
My beloved? What man doesn't enjoy Dan Leno?

33:24.435 --> 33:26.669
One who doesn't care for the music halls?

33:26.749 --> 33:30.301
Well, I'll venture to say
you've not seen the right shows, sir.

33:30.381 --> 33:32.168
If you ever wish for a recommendation...

33:32.248 --> 33:36.418
He was questioned in regard
to Alice Stanton's gown.

33:36.498 --> 33:39.735
A label sewn into it identified it as his...

33:39.815 --> 33:42.235
- ...a stage costume.
- So he knew her?

33:42.315 --> 33:45.902
"Leno stated that the dress was part
of a consignment of stage costumes...

33:45.981 --> 33:48.825
...he'd sold a year earlier to
a purveyor of secondhand clothes."

33:48.905 --> 33:52.068
- And he provided a receipt which proved it.
- Then it was merely a coincidence.

33:52.148 --> 33:53.519
Perhaps.

33:54.288 --> 33:58.901
As is perhaps the fact that
the purveyor of secondhand clothes...

33:59.480 --> 34:01.529
...was the late Mr. Gerrard...

34:01.609 --> 34:04.702
- ...murdered at Ratcliffe Highway.
- We should get a sample of his hand.

34:04.782 --> 34:07.301
Quite. And can we find out
what's happened to that dress?

34:07.381 --> 34:10.373
- It wasn't with the rest of the evidence.
- I'll look into it, sir.

34:20.929 --> 34:22.967
Why didn't you tell me
you questioned Dan Leno?

34:23.047 --> 34:25.835
- I haven't. Though I shall have to.
- In court they said you had.

34:25.914 --> 34:28.802
Not me. Before I joined the case.

34:29.781 --> 34:32.268
So is he a suspect or not?

34:33.248 --> 34:35.967
- Do you think he should be?
- Please don't play games with me.

34:36.047 --> 34:39.565
I have no desire to.
The Golem is still at large.

34:39.645 --> 34:42.877
Wasting my time could cost lives.

34:47.648 --> 34:49.866
Unless you are correct about my husband.

34:49.945 --> 34:52.744
If the Golem is no more,
then none are at risk.

34:54.614 --> 34:56.985
Besides yours...

34:57.065 --> 35:00.145
...you needn't hang, Mrs. Cree.

35:02.431 --> 35:04.315
Please call me Lizzie.

35:06.048 --> 35:09.968
- Just assist me in assisting you.
- I can't tell you what I don't know.

35:10.048 --> 35:13.354
All I ask is that you tell me what you do.

35:15.714 --> 35:17.301
Where should I start?

35:17.381 --> 35:21.611
How you came to know John Cree, perhaps.

35:23.514 --> 35:27.201
<i>Jim is very partial to me!
Though never a word has he said.</i>

35:27.281 --> 35:31.041
Right now he's lodging with Mrs. Kelly.
Do you know Mrs. Kelly?

35:31.121 --> 35:35.068
Don't you know Mrs. Kelly?
Good life-a-mighty, don't look so simple.

35:35.148 --> 35:37.401
<i>Everybody</i> knows Mrs. Kelly.

35:37.481 --> 35:40.035
- Am I going too fast for you, love?
- You spoof it, I'll write it.

35:40.115 --> 35:43.035
She's a mean one, Mrs. Kelly.
She'll buy half a dozen oysters...

35:43.115 --> 35:46.401
...and eat them in front of a mirror
to make them look like a dozen.

35:46.481 --> 35:48.335
What about...

35:49.114 --> 35:52.569
"I saw her take a coin from her purse
the other day, and I swear...

35:52.649 --> 35:56.077
...I saw Queen Victoria blinking
at the sight of sunlight"?

35:57.981 --> 36:00.531
Are those petticoats ironed yet?

36:00.611 --> 36:05.045
Good. Then you can come
over here and lace me up.

36:10.281 --> 36:12.769
- Fuck off, Victor.
- Come on, dear.

36:12.848 --> 36:16.148
You know I can't see from the back row,
and I do so love a double act.

36:16.228 --> 36:20.058
- Victor, out, out! Come on.
- Just a joke, Dan.

36:20.748 --> 36:22.835
Get that, will you, Lizzie.

36:22.915 --> 36:25.344
That'll be the reporter for my interview.

36:27.680 --> 36:31.101
- You're new.
- Lizzie. Seen you before, haven't I?

36:31.681 --> 36:34.702
- You work for <i>the Era.</i>
- I'm a playwright, but yes, indeed...

36:34.781 --> 36:38.583
<i>...the Era</i> puts food on my table. For now.

36:40.181 --> 36:41.968
John Cree.

36:42.048 --> 36:43.969
You got to sweep it.

36:45.148 --> 36:47.649
- Shall we?
- Can you help me dress, love?

36:49.248 --> 36:51.544
Threw me out the window.

36:53.481 --> 36:55.935
- The usual for everyone?
- Oh, yes, please, darling.

36:56.015 --> 36:58.255
- What about you, dear?
- A baked potato.

36:58.336 --> 37:02.235
You don't fancy a bit of meat tonight,
Lizzie? What's the matter, Dan?

37:02.315 --> 37:04.669
- She must be over 16.
- No, I mustn't.

37:04.748 --> 37:08.468
So, Lizzie, what's your act? Do tell.

37:08.947 --> 37:12.002
It's called "Little Lizzie the Dogsbody."

37:12.082 --> 37:16.068
Yeah, I do all manner of gags
with an iron and a pile of dirty smalls.

37:16.148 --> 37:19.135
- Oh, that sounds extraordinary.
- It is.

37:19.215 --> 37:22.615
She's dumbing you, John.
She means she's the prompt.

37:22.695 --> 37:25.165
I was only saying earlier
you might make a good gagger.

37:25.245 --> 37:27.935
- She's got the dial for it, hasn't she, Uncle?
- Say that again.

37:28.015 --> 37:31.301
She's got the dial for it, hasn't she, Uncle?

37:31.381 --> 37:32.469
Oh, thank you.

37:32.549 --> 37:36.235
I don't know where you put it all, Victor.
You must have hollow legs.

37:36.315 --> 37:38.935
I can hold as much as the next man,
thank you very much.

37:39.015 --> 37:41.015
Pour a quart in a pint pot,
you'll make a mess.

37:41.095 --> 37:45.335
Nonsense. I'm as right as rain. Can't
keep a good man down, as they say...

37:45.415 --> 37:48.143
...but I know where
you can put a good man up.

37:49.181 --> 37:52.335
- What in God's name is going on?
- Nothing.

37:52.415 --> 37:56.469
Lizzie stepped on my foot
by mistake. No harm done.

37:57.448 --> 37:59.537
I'm taking Lizzie home.

38:01.015 --> 38:04.515
- This is no place for an innocent young girl.
- Come, gentlemen. No harm done.

38:04.595 --> 38:07.234
- As the executioner said to the hanged man.
- I'll... I'll take her.

38:07.316 --> 38:09.569
- There's no need. I can walk alone.
- No, I'll not hear of it.

38:09.649 --> 38:12.468
Your food will get cold. I'll be quite safe.
Our digs are just around the corner.

38:12.548 --> 38:14.754
Then I'll be back in good time.

38:15.515 --> 38:18.001
Watch yourself, Victor.
John Cree's got a temper.

38:18.081 --> 38:19.944
I'm not afraid of him.

38:37.347 --> 38:38.863
Lizzie.

38:40.248 --> 38:42.249
I'm afraid there's...

38:43.148 --> 38:44.687
...awful news.

38:44.767 --> 38:48.835
Victor was found at the bottom
of the stairs last night.

38:49.115 --> 38:50.316
<i>Lizzie...</i>

38:51.415 --> 38:54.268
...are you trying to tell me
you suspected John Cree?

38:54.348 --> 38:56.834
I didn't say that.
I merely said he was protective.

38:56.914 --> 38:59.502
You said the same of Dan Leno.

38:59.582 --> 39:01.394
I seem to ignite the urge in men.

39:04.315 --> 39:06.536
He was a terrible little turd.

39:07.315 --> 39:10.101
But he was our terrible little turd.

39:10.181 --> 39:13.024
That's it, cheer up.

39:15.014 --> 39:20.269
I've suggested that we make
tonight's show a special tribute.

39:21.098 --> 39:23.150
We'll give him a grand send-off...

39:23.914 --> 39:25.501
...won't we?

39:25.581 --> 39:27.934
<i>Did you ever speak of it with John?</i>

39:28.014 --> 39:31.035
No. I never spoke of it to anyone.

39:31.115 --> 39:33.469
I preferred to chalk it up to fate.

39:33.549 --> 39:35.991
Would you rather owe your happiness
to simple good fortune...

39:36.071 --> 39:38.917
...or to an unspeakable act of violence?

39:39.198 --> 39:42.357
Little Victor's death brought you happiness?

39:43.548 --> 39:46.206
<i>Little Victor's death gave me life.</i>

40:06.447 --> 40:08.401
The people come through
the doors and they laugh.

40:08.481 --> 40:11.801
Dan, I was hoping you'd wipe your ass
with the papers. You don't read them.

40:11.881 --> 40:16.211
Dan? Do you think I could pay
my respects to Little Victor, too?

40:17.248 --> 40:21.768
Good God. This is a funny thing.
What a funny thing.

40:21.848 --> 40:25.135
Just a little song. A blue one maybe,
Victor would like that.

40:25.215 --> 40:28.405
A salty sailor act, as if I were a man.
It could be a scream.

40:28.485 --> 40:30.969
Go on, then, Lizzie. Give it a try.

40:31.049 --> 40:33.864
Isn't that costume
a little bit small for you, dear?

40:33.944 --> 40:35.976
That's the point.

40:48.856 --> 40:53.736
<i>A regular farmer's daughter
thought she'd like to come to town</i>

40:53.816 --> 40:57.775
<i>But what did she know about railways?</i>

40:57.855 --> 41:02.275
<i>She jumped up on the engine
but the stoker shoved her down</i>

41:02.355 --> 41:06.445
<i>What did she know about railways?</i>

41:06.524 --> 41:10.665
<i>A guard came up and spoke to her
and she sat sobbing there</i>

41:10.745 --> 41:14.943
<i>Asked her if she'd a ticket,
but she answered with a stare</i>

41:15.023 --> 41:20.888
<i>Said he, "You can't go up to town
until you've paid your fare</i>

41:21.667 --> 41:24.667
<i>But what did she know...</i> excuse me...

41:24.747 --> 41:28.200
<i>About railways?</i>

41:28.280 --> 41:33.776
<i>So she arrived at Euston
by the midnight train</i>

41:33.856 --> 41:37.492
<i>But when she got to the wicket there
someone wanted to punch her ticket</i>

41:37.572 --> 41:41.231
<i>The guards and porters
came round by the score</i>

41:41.311 --> 41:44.781
<i>And she told them all she'd never
had her ticket punched before</i>

41:44.861 --> 41:51.328
<i>Yeah, she told them all she'd never
had her ticket punched before</i>

42:01.947 --> 42:03.834
Oblige again!

42:04.014 --> 42:07.634
Lizzie, oblige again! They want more!

42:07.714 --> 42:10.916
- I don't have any more.
- You have them!

42:27.147 --> 42:29.565
Would you look at these rotten cotton gloves?

42:30.564 --> 42:32.977
That saltwater will shrink anything.

42:36.646 --> 42:39.977
Least that's what the ladies
down at the docks tell me.

42:48.546 --> 42:50.394
I just looked at the gloves
and they looked so absurd...

42:50.473 --> 42:53.268
- ...that the line just came to me like that.
- "Them rotten cotton gloves!"

42:53.348 --> 42:56.935
It could be your catchphrase. No need
to dip into the blue bag so much.

42:57.015 --> 42:59.668
They loved it. They loved it all.
They love you.

42:59.748 --> 43:01.787
- And who wouldn't.
- Uncle!

43:01.867 --> 43:04.302
Careful, Uncle. With Lizzie in that getup...

43:04.382 --> 43:06.801
...anyone looking over might think
you have an eye for the boys.

43:06.881 --> 43:10.101
Let them think what they like.
More drinks, please!

43:10.181 --> 43:14.010
Little Victor wouldn't have wanted any of us
standing up at the end of the night.

43:15.647 --> 43:20.484
I'm tired, I'm afraid.
Walk me home, will you, John?

43:22.048 --> 43:23.943
I'll come back.

43:28.080 --> 43:30.288
Why are you still wearing your costume?

43:30.367 --> 43:32.802
I hoped it might keep the men away.

43:33.881 --> 43:36.452
You prefer the girls, Lizzie?

43:37.681 --> 43:39.201
Nothing wrong in that if you do.

43:39.281 --> 43:41.968
Come on, no need to make something
from nothing. You dress like a girl.

43:42.048 --> 43:43.840
Yeah, on stage.

43:47.281 --> 43:51.768
Well, if you really care,
maybe I like how I felt on stage.

43:52.098 --> 43:53.918
I care.

43:54.248 --> 43:56.693
I care to see you happy.

43:57.781 --> 43:59.302
Tonight...

44:00.380 --> 44:02.435
...tonight, you look happy.

44:03.414 --> 44:06.135
We still need handwriting samples
from Marx, Gissing, and Leno.

44:06.215 --> 44:09.841
- Did you speak with the maid again?
- Aveline Ortega? I did, sir.

44:09.921 --> 44:12.901
- She won't hear a word said against him.
- You showed her the journal entries?

44:12.981 --> 44:16.333
- She swore the writing wasn't his.
- If Cree were our Golem...

44:16.413 --> 44:19.201
...it would certainly make sense
of him destroying his papers.

44:19.281 --> 44:21.903
And God knows as a failed playwright,
Cree must've grown sick...

44:21.983 --> 44:25.306
...of watching his famous wife
earn London's attention.

44:26.380 --> 44:29.448
- Do you fancy another?
- Trying to get me drunk?

44:30.148 --> 44:31.877
A pint, please.

44:34.180 --> 44:37.236
It was a joke. Didn't mean nothing.

44:38.564 --> 44:40.794
I didn't mean to offend.

44:43.147 --> 44:44.599
I'm...

44:45.598 --> 44:47.170
...on your side.

44:54.547 --> 44:57.101
It's not the Golem haunting you, is it?

44:57.181 --> 45:00.801
- It's her.
- She's going to hang, Flood.

45:00.981 --> 45:03.602
We have to rule out the other suspects.

45:04.711 --> 45:08.012
Well, I may have found
an eyewitness in Limehouse, sir.

45:08.311 --> 45:10.743
<i>Scaoil liom! Scaoil liom!</i>

45:11.714 --> 45:15.901
You're not in any trouble.
I'm taking you to someone who can translate.

45:15.981 --> 45:17.572
Understand?

45:20.215 --> 45:22.734
This is... this is sister Mary.

45:22.814 --> 45:25.274
<i>Tá mo mháthair tar éis mé a dhíol cheana.</i>

45:25.354 --> 45:27.968
<i>Tá fear do m'fhuadach ar mo lá breithe.</i>

45:28.048 --> 45:30.235
The child says she's not for sale.

45:30.314 --> 45:32.934
Her mum's got a fella
taking her on her next birthday.

45:33.014 --> 45:34.934
No, no, please.

45:35.014 --> 45:40.314
Tell her my colleague showed her
some photographs, suspects in a crime.

45:40.394 --> 45:45.219
She seemed to recognize one of them.
We need to know where and when she saw him.

45:47.080 --> 45:50.267
Sir, this is where Solomon Weil lived!

45:50.347 --> 45:52.500
The scholar, the third victim.

45:52.580 --> 45:55.077
- Which house number did he...
- Number 4.

46:02.013 --> 46:03.769
This man?

46:05.947 --> 46:08.201
Families starve in the streets.

46:08.280 --> 46:11.168
Women are used up
and thrown away, then you...

46:11.247 --> 46:14.168
...you persecute one
who fights for the people.

46:14.247 --> 46:17.570
You're not fit to clean the boots
of a man like Karl Marx.

46:25.613 --> 46:26.902
So...

46:27.581 --> 46:31.267
...London declares that the Jew
was murdered by a Jewish monster?

46:31.347 --> 46:34.434
And so absolves itself of all responsibility.

46:34.914 --> 46:36.875
Make no mistake, gentlemen...

46:36.955 --> 46:40.367
...it is not Solomon Weil
who's mutilated and murdered here.

46:40.447 --> 46:41.835
It is the Jew.

46:41.915 --> 46:44.601
None of the Golem's
other victims were Hebrews, sir.

46:44.681 --> 46:46.788
But do you not see?

46:46.868 --> 46:50.434
This murderer strikes
at the very symbols of the city...

46:50.514 --> 46:52.604
...the Jew, the whore.

46:52.684 --> 46:57.169
They are the sacrificial tributes
in this labyrinth of London.

46:58.398 --> 47:02.643
And so of course must be ritually butchered.

47:11.580 --> 47:14.009
What is it that you wish me to write?

47:16.279 --> 47:19.035
"The morning herald...

47:19.914 --> 47:23.342
...had declined to review my debut."

47:24.081 --> 47:26.571
<i>All that work for nothing.</i>

47:27.581 --> 47:30.714
<i>I resolved that this time
I'd put on a show...</i>

47:30.794 --> 47:33.234
<i>...that everyone would notice.</i>

47:35.048 --> 47:40.276
<i>A fine opening act
of the crowd-pleasing sort.</i>

48:09.014 --> 48:12.134
<i>And I went on to create a spectacle...</i>

48:12.214 --> 48:15.630
<i>...that no beholder would ever forget.</i>

48:22.146 --> 48:25.001
"It was all too easy to kill a whore.

48:25.080 --> 48:28.700
Tonight I would return to kill the Jew."

48:28.780 --> 48:32.500
This is absurd. You didn't do this.

48:32.580 --> 48:34.113
Of course I didn't.

48:37.314 --> 48:42.190
Would you agree with the defendant
that in the weeks before his death...

48:42.480 --> 48:46.038
...Mr. Cree had seemed "morbid"?

48:46.117 --> 48:47.935
No, sir.

48:48.015 --> 48:50.268
He was in good spirits.

48:51.747 --> 48:56.234
And how would you describe relations
between Mr. Cree and his wife?

48:56.314 --> 49:01.001
Not especially good, sir.
They saw very little of each other.

49:01.080 --> 49:06.067
And yet Mrs. Cree insisted
on preparing him a nightly draft?

49:06.147 --> 49:07.667
That is correct, sir.

49:07.747 --> 49:10.898
And did you hear Mr. Cree
express suspicions...

49:10.978 --> 49:15.367
...that she might have tainted
this draft with something?

49:15.447 --> 49:17.200
Not quite.

49:17.280 --> 49:19.671
Though just before his death...

49:19.751 --> 49:22.210
...I overheard them in dispute.

49:22.290 --> 49:26.977
I heard Mr. Cree say,
"You devil. You have done this."

49:32.546 --> 49:36.180
She may as well have placed
the noose around my neck herself.

49:37.514 --> 49:42.033
You must make it plain to the jury that
there was bad blood between the two of you.

49:42.113 --> 49:45.701
- Romantic jealousy.
- I never stood between them.

49:45.781 --> 49:48.731
I'm sure my feelings on intimacy
are plain to you by now.

49:48.811 --> 49:51.167
John was free to court
Aveline if he wanted to.

49:51.247 --> 49:53.441
But he had his heart set on you.

49:53.521 --> 49:55.968
I did nothing to encourage it.

49:56.047 --> 49:59.134
My stage career had taken off.
I rarely saw him.

50:00.113 --> 50:01.935
And then...

50:02.414 --> 50:05.037
...out of the blue, he invited me for supper.

50:05.947 --> 50:09.267
- Your new show's tremendous.
- We feel awful intruding.

50:09.347 --> 50:12.201
- We simply adore you.
- Thank you.

50:13.280 --> 50:16.534
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- I'll treasure this.

50:16.614 --> 50:19.235
- I can't believe it.
- What a surprise!

50:20.013 --> 50:21.584
As I was saying...

50:21.664 --> 50:25.567
...I have reached the end of
the first act of "Misery Junction."

50:25.647 --> 50:29.563
But I can't quite decide what to do
with my heroine next, and...

50:29.643 --> 50:31.834
...I thought you might advise me.

50:31.914 --> 50:35.566
- I'm flattered.
- The heroine's name is Katherine Dove.

50:35.646 --> 50:39.063
When I began, I had her in
the workhouses, but now I have her...

50:39.143 --> 50:41.967
...sewing sailcloth on the docks.

50:42.647 --> 50:46.100
My mother died when I was young. Her kidneys.

50:46.180 --> 50:49.802
- It was so fast.
- Orphaned and alone at 14.

50:51.280 --> 50:55.334
- Is Katherine Dove an orphan?
- She could be.

50:55.414 --> 50:58.500
But you've still not told me what to do
with her by the end of the first act.

50:58.580 --> 51:00.668
- What's your dilemma?
- At the moment...

51:00.748 --> 51:04.696
...she's very close
to salvation and ruin, and...

51:04.776 --> 51:06.967
...I'm wondering if I should rescue her.

51:07.047 --> 51:08.568
Yes.

51:08.947 --> 51:10.967
Have her become successful.

51:11.047 --> 51:13.316
Loved by her audiences.

51:13.396 --> 51:16.834
But she's very much alone.
Living in theatrical digs, hand to mouth.

51:16.913 --> 51:19.701
- It's a life of degradation.
- Come on.

51:19.781 --> 51:23.014
People love to see degradation upon
the stage. It's what they pay for.

51:23.094 --> 51:25.868
Yeah, but they expect to see a happy ending.

51:25.947 --> 51:28.401
And Katherine deserves a protector.

51:28.481 --> 51:30.000
She does.

51:30.080 --> 51:32.300
Her manager, perhaps.

51:32.380 --> 51:35.411
- Someone kindly, like Uncle.
- No, an elderly character...

51:35.491 --> 51:38.834
...the audience would know he
wouldn't live to see her into old age.

51:38.913 --> 51:41.900
A friend, then. A comic, maybe.

51:41.980 --> 51:44.268
I would like to give her a suitor.

51:45.117 --> 51:48.084
Someone who cares fiercely
for her well-being.

51:48.164 --> 51:50.051
A white knight.

51:50.481 --> 51:52.350
What do you think?

51:54.414 --> 51:57.275
I think Katherine Dove
can look out for herself.

51:59.977 --> 52:02.668
In the bowl. Yes, there we go.

52:02.748 --> 52:05.103
Get it out. That's it.

52:06.050 --> 52:07.551
Gin.

52:09.579 --> 52:12.835
Down here. There we go.

52:13.714 --> 52:17.711
God. I think I put my back out
carrying her up the stairs.

52:20.513 --> 52:23.688
I see you decided to dress
as a woman this evening.

52:24.014 --> 52:26.147
Can't wear a costume out to supper, can I?

52:26.227 --> 52:28.242
Wouldn't be the first time.

52:36.514 --> 52:38.701
Be careful of that one, Lizzie.

52:38.781 --> 52:43.601
Don't lead him up the garden path unless
you're prepared to be dragged indoors.

52:43.681 --> 52:45.568
He offered me the lead in "Misery Junction."

52:45.648 --> 52:48.276
He'll expect something in return.

52:56.780 --> 52:59.261
You don't need him, Lizzie.

53:00.080 --> 53:02.109
You did all this on your own.

53:05.513 --> 53:07.402
I could do more.

53:08.781 --> 53:10.635
Could be a real actress.

53:11.614 --> 53:15.677
Show the world what people
like us are really capable of.

53:17.847 --> 53:19.680
I just need a chance.

53:23.079 --> 53:26.000
Here we sit, the two most
famous faces on the stage...

53:26.080 --> 53:28.935
...and you suggest the world
conspires to oppress us.

53:30.214 --> 53:33.077
Remember that book you lent me? Pope?

53:33.157 --> 53:37.401
In the temple of fame, some people's names
are carved in stone and others in ice.

53:38.380 --> 53:40.267
We're clowns, Dan.

53:41.200 --> 53:43.008
We'll be forgotten.

53:46.379 --> 53:49.000
If you think a man like John Cree
is going to change that...

53:49.080 --> 53:51.343
...I don't have the breath to argue.

53:53.780 --> 53:58.668
And you know she's got a soft spot for him.
And whatever her faults, she's family.

53:59.597 --> 54:02.461
And we look out for each other, don't we?

54:09.180 --> 54:11.534
The big finale is the hanging.
We've a life-size gallows.

54:11.614 --> 54:14.668
I'll wear this harness, concealed, and then
drop right through the trap just there.

54:14.747 --> 54:17.615
- Looks just like a real hanging.
- You sure it's safe, this contraption?

54:17.695 --> 54:21.932
- You're not wearing a real noose, are you?
- The noose is real but the fall is broken...

54:22.012 --> 54:24.800
- ...by the harness.
- Where's Lizzie?

54:24.880 --> 54:27.638
Up above giving John Cree
an interview for <i>the Era.</i>

54:27.717 --> 54:30.867
- Is that what they call it?
- I'll go and tell her to hurry up.

54:30.947 --> 54:35.000
The play's a shocker, but a spoof shocker,
the way only our marvelous company can do it.

54:35.080 --> 54:38.700
Dan wrote it. It's based on
the Ratcliffe Highway murders of 1811.

54:38.780 --> 54:40.200
- John Williams.
- Pardon?

54:40.280 --> 54:43.234
- The killer's name was John Williams.
- Quite. But much of it is fiction.

54:43.314 --> 54:46.200
It's all great fun, and terribly gory.
You must put that in for your readers.

54:46.280 --> 54:48.700
Dan says everybody thrills
to gore these days.

54:48.780 --> 54:50.434
Let's have you finished, John.

54:50.514 --> 54:53.167
She's not even ready and
she's on stage in 10 minutes.

54:53.247 --> 54:55.700
We can't have the star late
for the first performance.

54:55.780 --> 54:58.433
Dan's still the star. Always will be.

54:58.513 --> 55:02.178
Thought I felt my ears burning.
Did anyone check the safety?

55:02.258 --> 55:04.900
Of course. Wouldn't let anything
happen to our Lizzie, would we?

55:04.980 --> 55:07.634
- How's the crowd?
- Excellent. Great number of Jews.

55:07.713 --> 55:10.100
I believe it's one of their holidays.

55:10.180 --> 55:13.200
You should speak to them in Yiddish.
They will love it.

55:13.280 --> 55:15.000
Wish them...

55:15.080 --> 55:17.143
<i>"...meesa meschina."</i>

55:22.314 --> 55:25.543
Welcome, brave hearts,
to an evening of horror.

55:31.514 --> 55:33.234
Our play's about to begin...

55:34.413 --> 55:36.334
...but first, ladies and gentlemen...

55:36.414 --> 55:40.534
...and those not unconnected with
a certain historical chosen race...

55:40.614 --> 55:44.090
...may I wish you all
from the bottom of my heart...

55:44.679 --> 55:46.867
<i>...meesa meschina.</i>

55:47.247 --> 55:49.276
That is <i>mashugana!</i>

55:55.912 --> 55:57.933
What did you say that for?

55:58.013 --> 56:01.242
- What happened?
- Lizzie wished the Jews a sudden death!

56:02.280 --> 56:04.729
Here we are again!

56:09.126 --> 56:11.142
It was only a lark, Lizzie.

56:18.146 --> 56:21.189
I came back at once to see
if you were all right.

56:46.480 --> 56:48.900
<i>And after that, you began courting?</i>

56:50.079 --> 56:51.730
After a fashion.

56:51.810 --> 56:55.834
I could never love John enough
to give him what he really wanted.

56:56.214 --> 56:58.901
But you grew to love him?

57:00.120 --> 57:02.435
I wanted to be in his play.

57:03.364 --> 57:06.934
He wanted the gratification
of plucking a poor needy girl...

57:07.014 --> 57:09.476
...from misery and saving her.

57:11.279 --> 57:13.527
We used one another equally.

57:14.679 --> 57:17.481
Perhaps that's the best
that can be said of any coupling.

57:18.719 --> 57:21.167
That's a very dim view.

57:21.946 --> 57:24.463
If you seek a dim view,
be sure to ask a comedian.

57:34.879 --> 57:37.867
Alice Stanton's dress finally showed up.

57:37.947 --> 57:41.409
Improperly archived,
like everything else here.

57:44.912 --> 57:46.942
Been at the jail again?

57:49.746 --> 57:51.800
Anything more on Cree?

57:52.280 --> 57:55.533
Only that he was a manipulative ass
who fancied himself as a White Knight.

57:55.613 --> 58:00.468
I meant as relating to our case.
The Golem. Remember him?

58:00.547 --> 58:02.217
Cree knew of the murderer John Williams.

58:02.297 --> 58:05.398
Yet, apparently, so did Dan Leno. In fact,
Leno wrote a whole play about the fellow.

58:05.478 --> 58:07.049
Golem suspect who is alive.

58:07.129 --> 58:09.881
- That would be bad news.
- For his next victim, certainly.

58:09.961 --> 58:12.400
And for you. Or do you no longer care
what becomes of your career?

58:12.479 --> 58:14.651
- I've a job to do and I'm doing it.
- And which job would that be?

58:14.731 --> 58:17.667
Watch your tongue, Flood.
Do I need to remind you of your position?

58:17.747 --> 58:21.887
That may be helpful. Because
there are times when I'm confused...

58:21.967 --> 58:25.434
...as to whether we're here to find
the Golem or to save Elizabeth.

58:25.513 --> 58:27.418
Perhaps we'll do both!

58:28.147 --> 58:29.977
Who knows...

58:34.346 --> 58:36.566
Dear God, how many pockets did Leno need?

58:36.646 --> 58:39.987
He tosses things into the crowd.
Sweeties. Flowers. Undergarments.

58:40.067 --> 58:42.867
Sounds hilarious.
Didn't Roberts empty the contents?

58:42.947 --> 58:45.854
The coroner's office did it.
Why? Did they miss something?

58:59.113 --> 59:02.067
8 Gower Place? Why do I know that?

59:02.147 --> 59:06.526
Perhaps because we're due a visit.
It's George Gissing's address.

59:08.013 --> 59:11.533
His wife gave him an alibi for the night
of the Ratcliffe Highway murders...

59:11.613 --> 59:14.276
...but she seemed fond of her drink.

59:21.813 --> 59:24.200
We need to talk to Mr. Gissing, madam.

59:24.280 --> 59:26.368
George isn't here. He just left.

59:26.447 --> 59:28.666
Do you know where he was going?

59:28.746 --> 59:31.008
Limehouse, perhaps?

59:53.079 --> 59:56.416
Not yet. I'm interested to see where he goes.

59:56.496 --> 01:00:00.126
What business a scholar has
in the streets of Limehouse.

01:00:39.713 --> 01:00:43.194
- Madam, we're from Scotland Yard.
- We're just a pharmacy. You go away!

01:00:43.274 --> 01:00:45.109
Check my record!

01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:52.328
Our business is with Mr. Gissing,
the man who just entered, not you.

01:00:55.646 --> 01:00:58.947
Good customer. He keep his work here.

01:01:02.047 --> 01:01:05.209
Always working. Writing.

01:01:08.107 --> 01:01:11.933
Mr. Gissing, I'm Detective
Inspector Kildare of Scotland Yard.

01:01:12.013 --> 01:01:16.475
Perhaps you could explain how this came to
be in the possession of a murdered woman.

01:01:18.445 --> 01:01:20.933
I'm afraid you'll find
my address in the pockets...

01:01:21.013 --> 01:01:23.533
...of a great many women in this area, sir.

01:01:23.613 --> 01:01:26.633
My wife, Nell, is in the habit
of going missing.

01:01:26.713 --> 01:01:30.100
I give my address so that
they may contact me if they see her.

01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:33.850
Let us just say my wife
used to ply the same trade.

01:01:34.879 --> 01:01:37.800
- You don't seem in the least bit surprised.
- By what?

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:41.500
That a gentleman like me, a scholar,
should have wed a fallen woman.

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:45.109
Why would anyone be surprised?
The world is full of men...

01:01:45.189 --> 01:01:47.568
- ...like you, Mr. Gissing.
- I beg your pardon?

01:01:47.648 --> 01:01:51.497
Men who feign generosity when what
they really seek is congratulation.

01:01:51.577 --> 01:01:54.000
Men who play God by saving lives.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:56.366
Is it really so different, I wonder...

01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:59.787
- ...from playing God by taking them?
- I am not a murderer, sir.

01:02:00.047 --> 01:02:03.617
Then perhaps you will write
the words that I dictate?

01:02:03.847 --> 01:02:06.234
Let's get this thing done.

01:02:06.313 --> 01:02:09.388
"September 10, 1880.

01:02:11.266 --> 01:02:13.329
My public debut...

01:02:13.412 --> 01:02:16.167
...had garnered rave reviews."

01:02:16.246 --> 01:02:20.134
I could scarcely wait to begin
work on my next creation...

01:02:20.214 --> 01:02:22.900
...but there was time to pass before dark...

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:26.742
<i>...so I paid a visit
to the Ratcliffe Highway shop.</i>

01:02:33.778 --> 01:02:36.433
<i>I bought some cufflinks
from the owner's wife.</i>

01:02:36.513 --> 01:02:38.700
<i>I could tell that when the time came...</i>

01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:42.441
<i>...she would make a fine player
in my magnum opus.</i>

01:03:16.529 --> 01:03:18.784
You're not the Jew from the library.

01:03:19.913 --> 01:03:22.601
Well... no matter.

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:26.067
Who are you? What do you want?

01:03:26.147 --> 01:03:28.400
I have come to discourse with you.

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:31.526
About death and everlasting life.

01:03:33.178 --> 01:03:34.733
Herein...

01:03:34.813 --> 01:03:36.922
...lies the secret.

01:03:46.245 --> 01:03:49.299
<i>It was here that I read
of the mythical Golem...</i>

01:03:49.379 --> 01:03:52.354
<i>...a homunculus of clay given life by man.</i>

01:03:53.313 --> 01:03:57.166
<i>How could any Londoner fail
to delight in this piece of theater?</i>

01:03:57.246 --> 01:04:00.821
<i>I could even see myself appearing
before the next unfortunate...</i>

01:04:00.901 --> 01:04:03.732
<i>...with mallet in hand exclaiming...</i>

01:04:03.812 --> 01:04:06.291
<i>"...Here we are again."</i>

01:04:09.413 --> 01:04:12.480
- May I go now?
- What?

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.347
- Oh, yes, I'm sorry.
- Why would you be thinking of me still?

01:04:16.427 --> 01:04:18.700
My hand doesn't match at all.
You know I'm innocent.

01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:22.373
I know. I was reading what you wrote.
You were in my mind. I'm sorry.

01:04:22.453 --> 01:04:25.633
- Something I missed.
- Oh, I see. What is it?

01:04:25.713 --> 01:04:28.927
A line from the journal.

01:04:30.046 --> 01:04:34.533
"I bought some cufflinks
from the owner's wife."

01:04:35.512 --> 01:04:38.136
<i>On September the 10th,
the Golem made a purchase...</i>

01:04:38.216 --> 01:04:40.642
<i>...from the Ratcliffe Highway shop.</i>

01:05:02.378 --> 01:05:06.066
<i>A new production of "Bluebeard"
opens this weekend...</i>

01:05:06.146 --> 01:05:12.215
...and all of London longs to see
the great Dan Leno performing it.

01:05:12.947 --> 01:05:17.768
But I know they yearn
for more potent excitements.

01:05:18.847 --> 01:05:24.100
This is pantomime in its purest form.

01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:28.733
I could even see myself appearing
before the next unfortunate...

01:05:28.813 --> 01:05:31.666
...with a mallet in my hand, exclaiming...

01:05:31.746 --> 01:05:34.242
"...here we are again!"

01:05:41.545 --> 01:05:45.633
<i>What strange coincidence
and delight to discover...</i>

01:05:45.713 --> 01:05:47.867
<i>...on the streets of Limehouse...</i>

01:05:47.947 --> 01:05:52.033
<i>...a whore wearing a costume
I remembered well.</i>

01:05:52.763 --> 01:05:56.633
<i>She was a player waiting for a role.</i>

01:05:56.713 --> 01:05:59.933
<i>Of course, I obliged her.</i>

01:06:00.012 --> 01:06:03.900
The public yearned for the next installment.

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:07.675
And one should never keep
an audience waiting.

01:06:11.146 --> 01:06:13.900
<i>We need to forget about Cree
and concentrate on Leno.</i>

01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:18.133
The Golem even imagined himself
saying, "Here we are again."

01:06:18.213 --> 01:06:21.733
I know, but apparently everyone
knows Leno's catch-phrase.

01:06:21.813 --> 01:06:24.874
There's Alice Stanton's dress
and the fact he knew Mr. Gerrard.

01:06:24.954 --> 01:06:27.233
We're all part of London's tapestry.

01:06:27.313 --> 01:06:30.409
Sometimes threads get crossed.

01:06:32.712 --> 01:06:34.609
Good Lord!

01:06:38.445 --> 01:06:41.780
We should buy tickets.
I'd be intrigued to see how it ends.

01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:45.096
- I could recommend many better shows.
- I was making a joke, Flood.

01:06:46.045 --> 01:06:48.753
As was I. Obviously.

01:06:48.833 --> 01:06:50.933
Who'd wish to see
something in such poor taste?

01:06:51.012 --> 01:06:53.815
Apparently London's appetite
for horror knows no bounds.

01:06:53.895 --> 01:06:56.399
Our Golem was quite correct about that.

01:06:56.479 --> 01:06:58.833
Oh, Bluey, please!

01:06:58.913 --> 01:07:03.512
Have mercy! It's been days since I've eaten!

01:07:14.345 --> 01:07:17.999
Oh, you are a kind man, Bluey!

01:07:18.279 --> 01:07:21.908
I shall never have it said
you're not good to me.

01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:26.008
I thought I might expire from starvation.

01:07:39.279 --> 01:07:41.693
What on earth are you doing, dear?

01:07:41.773 --> 01:07:44.767
- I'm taking my medical treatment.
- You're treatment?

01:07:44.847 --> 01:07:49.500
The doctor told me to take
a daily walk on an empty stomach.

01:07:55.678 --> 01:07:58.908
Brought the receipt,
as you requested in your telegram.

01:08:00.513 --> 01:08:04.367
As you will see, I did not buy cufflinks.

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:06.199
A ladies' hat.

01:08:06.279 --> 01:08:09.999
I often shopped for stagewear
at Gerrard's little shop.

01:08:10.079 --> 01:08:12.899
God rest him. I knew him well.

01:08:12.979 --> 01:08:15.800
Now, you mentioned needing
a sample of my hand.

01:08:15.879 --> 01:08:20.600
Well, I brought a pile of my old papers.
Please, take as many as you see fit.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:25.162
I'm afraid I'll need you to produce
a sample in my presence, Mr. Leno.

01:08:27.179 --> 01:08:30.879
Then you will permit me to pay you a visit
at Scotland Yard tomorrow afternoon?

01:08:30.959 --> 01:08:33.167
Only, I have supper arrangements.

01:08:34.296 --> 01:08:36.584
And I've still to be rid of all of this.

01:08:37.412 --> 01:08:39.466
If you'll... excuse me?

01:08:39.546 --> 01:08:43.250
Perhaps we could continue
to talk while you're...

01:08:43.879 --> 01:08:48.493
I've some questions I'd like
to ask you about John Cree.

01:08:49.513 --> 01:08:53.198
Then I shall try to answer them. Though
one should never speak ill of the dead.

01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:56.066
- You didn't care for the man?
- I was friendly with his wife.

01:08:56.145 --> 01:08:59.933
He made her unhappy.
You may extrapolate the rest.

01:09:00.013 --> 01:09:02.466
When did you last see him?

01:09:02.546 --> 01:09:07.500
First night of his play, "Misery Junction,"
which also happened to be the closing night.

01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:10.233
I know. Did you see him afterwards?

01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:13.975
Of course. This is my theater.

01:09:14.196 --> 01:09:17.220
I took over managing it last year when...

01:09:18.546 --> 01:09:21.399
...Uncle joined the great
pantomime in the sky.

01:09:21.979 --> 01:09:24.359
The performance was here?

01:09:24.439 --> 01:09:28.506
For Lizzie's sake.
Whatever became of our friendship...

01:09:28.747 --> 01:09:30.616
...we'll always be family.

01:09:32.546 --> 01:09:35.700
- Is John Cree a suspect?
- I'm not at liberty to say.

01:09:35.779 --> 01:09:39.366
A posthumous suspect.
What will you do, dig him up for the trial?

01:09:39.446 --> 01:09:43.453
Do you know why Lizzie might be
reluctant to voice any suspicions?

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:46.973
You think she's protecting him?

01:09:47.513 --> 01:09:49.866
Now, that's a novel slant.

01:09:49.946 --> 01:09:52.401
Most people believe she poisoned him.

01:09:53.729 --> 01:09:55.489
Do you?

01:09:58.646 --> 01:10:03.003
Either way, that man was
the author of his own demise.

01:10:03.413 --> 01:10:05.700
He practically destroyed her.

01:10:05.779 --> 01:10:09.647
Insisting she give up the stage... I mean,
he may as well have ended her life.

01:10:10.413 --> 01:10:13.866
Do you think he was capable of ending a life?

01:10:14.246 --> 01:10:16.534
Literally, I mean.

01:10:17.513 --> 01:10:20.425
Who knows what any man is capable of?

01:10:21.547 --> 01:10:23.999
We all wear pantomime masks...

01:10:24.079 --> 01:10:25.975
...do we not?

01:10:28.078 --> 01:10:30.333
I'm sorry, I really must dress now.

01:10:30.413 --> 01:10:33.108
First, tell me about Little Victor.

01:10:35.578 --> 01:10:38.066
If the injustices of the past interest you...

01:10:38.146 --> 01:10:41.517
...you'd do better to look into
the demise of Tommy Farr.

01:10:41.946 --> 01:10:43.073
Uncle?

01:10:44.512 --> 01:10:45.709
Uncle.

01:10:56.346 --> 01:10:59.765
They said the jury expects
to reach a verdict this afternoon.

01:10:59.845 --> 01:11:01.356
I know. Lizzie...

01:11:01.436 --> 01:11:04.206
It would seem the press
have reached theirs already.

01:11:07.078 --> 01:11:09.033
Lizzie, I spoke with Dan.

01:11:09.113 --> 01:11:12.177
He urged me to look into Uncle's death.

01:11:12.946 --> 01:11:16.487
If you wanted to know about Uncle,
you should simply have asked.

01:11:16.567 --> 01:11:19.199
Come into the parlor.

01:11:19.279 --> 01:11:21.900
As the spider said to the fly.

01:11:23.379 --> 01:11:26.099
Isn't that how it goes? The rhyme?

01:11:26.179 --> 01:11:28.068
It may be, Lizzie.

01:11:29.579 --> 01:11:32.400
It may be. Cucumber sandwich?

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.966
- No, thanks.
- Oh, I forgot.

01:11:35.046 --> 01:11:38.141
You're not entirely partial
to cucumber, are you?

01:11:40.711 --> 01:11:42.766
What's this about, Uncle?

01:11:42.946 --> 01:11:44.651
Why'd you invite me?

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:47.900
I want to show you something.

01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:50.519
Well, close your eyes.

01:11:53.078 --> 01:11:54.907
Good girl.

01:12:19.378 --> 01:12:21.414
It's just my fun, Lizzie.

01:12:22.530 --> 01:12:25.167
I like a good beating every now and again.

01:12:26.046 --> 01:12:27.933
Doesn't everyone?

01:12:28.712 --> 01:12:30.266
I know her.

01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:33.567
That's the girl who assisted the Great
Bolini. She used to be sawn in half.

01:12:33.646 --> 01:12:37.289
That's her, ducks. What a performer.

01:12:38.946 --> 01:12:41.230
But it's a shame
she had to leave the company.

01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:44.600
- Why have you shown me this?
- Don't play the innocent with me.

01:12:44.679 --> 01:12:47.099
I am not playing. I am real.

01:12:47.179 --> 01:12:49.899
Well, I'd be grateful
if you could oblige me, Lizzie...

01:12:49.979 --> 01:12:53.356
...with a pose, a tableau.

01:12:53.436 --> 01:12:57.508
- Perhaps a little beating?
- I'd rather be destroyed first.

01:12:58.678 --> 01:13:02.012
- I'm prepared to forget this visit took place.
- As I said...

01:13:02.412 --> 01:13:04.426
...it is a pity she had to go.

01:13:04.605 --> 01:13:06.712
She grew tired of performing.

01:13:08.311 --> 01:13:10.199
You would never be rid of me.

01:13:10.878 --> 01:13:15.063
- Dan would never allow it.
- Well, I find, as keeper of Bunce...

01:13:15.678 --> 01:13:17.966
...that I can do as I please.

01:13:19.145 --> 01:13:20.681
Now...

01:13:21.310 --> 01:13:23.192
...you keep my secret...

01:13:23.272 --> 01:13:25.955
- ...and I'll keep yours.
- I have no secrets.

01:13:28.245 --> 01:13:30.168
You shall in a moment.

01:13:42.213 --> 01:13:44.400
<i>He said I'm to return to him next Sunday...</i>

01:13:45.578 --> 01:13:47.999
...and every Sunday hereafter.

01:13:48.079 --> 01:13:50.133
To do the same again?

01:13:50.682 --> 01:13:52.733
There's photographs.

01:13:53.712 --> 01:13:56.256
- John, I had to speak of it to somebody.
- This is monstrous, Lizzie!

01:13:56.336 --> 01:13:58.208
You can't tell a soul.

01:14:00.611 --> 01:14:03.067
I shall put a stop to this.

01:14:03.447 --> 01:14:05.337
But first...

01:14:06.313 --> 01:14:07.891
...I wish to do this.

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:13.426
He's robbed you of your honor.
Let me restore it to you.

01:14:15.512 --> 01:14:19.599
Uncle died three days
after John confronted him.

01:14:19.679 --> 01:14:22.999
Uncle was not young. He had a weak
heart and a fondness for drink.

01:14:23.079 --> 01:14:24.954
That's not what Dan Leno thinks.

01:14:25.134 --> 01:14:29.599
He thinks that John blackmailed Uncle
into changing his will and then killed him.

01:14:29.879 --> 01:14:32.561
Â£500 and the camera.

01:14:33.995 --> 01:14:36.609
It would seem I gave an excellent beating.

01:14:38.212 --> 01:14:41.250
You don't want to be saved, do you?

01:14:42.241 --> 01:14:44.223
Not by me.

01:14:44.303 --> 01:14:46.167
Not by any man.

01:14:47.246 --> 01:14:49.507
I don't deserve to be saved.

01:15:05.811 --> 01:15:07.332
John, I can't.

01:15:07.412 --> 01:15:09.832
What do you mean?
We're husband and wife now, Lizzie.

01:15:09.912 --> 01:15:13.316
- I know.
- Three years I've waited.

01:15:13.396 --> 01:15:16.699
Three years of courtship
and endless bloody engagement.

01:15:16.779 --> 01:15:20.133
It's hardly my fault that Panto
season extended 'til easter.

01:15:20.213 --> 01:15:23.032
Would you have had me spend
our wedding night playing Aladdin?

01:15:23.112 --> 01:15:25.366
It seems now that option
would've been scarcely different.

01:15:25.445 --> 01:15:28.666
- Please, John, just try to understand.
- No, you understand!

01:15:29.545 --> 01:15:31.066
John, please, I don't like it.

01:15:31.146 --> 01:15:33.333
I don't ask for gratitude
for all I've done for you.

01:15:33.413 --> 01:15:37.641
All I ask is that you fulfill
your duties as a wife.

01:15:51.086 --> 01:15:52.942
What are you doing here?

01:15:55.379 --> 01:15:56.967
Hello.

01:15:57.646 --> 01:15:59.632
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:15:59.712 --> 01:16:03.493
I'll have a new contract drawn up
tomorrow, John John. But don't you worry.

01:16:03.573 --> 01:16:06.432
- Lizzie!
- But don't you worry.

01:16:06.812 --> 01:16:08.375
Lizzie.

01:16:10.845 --> 01:16:12.398
Well, well.

01:16:14.012 --> 01:16:17.333
If it isn't Mrs. John Cree.

01:16:17.412 --> 01:16:21.266
Three months of married life and you're
missing the roar of the greasepaint already.

01:16:21.346 --> 01:16:25.366
Oh, nonsense.
I've been too busy to miss anything.

01:16:25.445 --> 01:16:30.218
What tosh! Little Lizzie without an audience.

01:16:30.679 --> 01:16:33.532
You mustn't let that rotten man
order you about so.

01:16:33.612 --> 01:16:35.999
John is perfectly happy for me to perform.

01:16:36.079 --> 01:16:38.199
Still going to play the lead
in "Misery Junction."

01:16:38.279 --> 01:16:39.789
Come of it, Lizzie.

01:16:39.869 --> 01:16:43.706
That man's so petrified of failure
he'll never bring himself to finish it.

01:16:43.786 --> 01:16:47.599
He's writing every day at the library.
It's almost complete.

01:16:47.679 --> 01:16:50.099
I'm telling you as a friend, Lizzie.

01:16:50.179 --> 01:16:53.399
Forget "Misery Junction." Forget John.

01:16:53.679 --> 01:16:55.569
If you want your name etched in stone...

01:16:55.649 --> 01:16:59.267
...you're gonna have to take up
the chisel yourself.

01:17:00.146 --> 01:17:02.233
So, to what do we owe the pleasure?

01:17:02.313 --> 01:17:04.584
I'm actually here to see Aveline.

01:17:07.178 --> 01:17:09.666
I have a proposition for you, dear.

01:17:09.746 --> 01:17:11.836
I'm in need of a ladies' maid.

01:17:12.246 --> 01:17:13.746
Me?

01:17:14.946 --> 01:17:16.296
You must be playing.

01:17:16.375 --> 01:17:19.233
I can offer you twice the weekly
wage you're earning here.

01:17:19.313 --> 01:17:22.799
What I require is some help
bearing the load of my...

01:17:22.879 --> 01:17:24.699
...my wifely duties.

01:17:24.779 --> 01:17:26.639
Dear God, Lizzie.

01:17:49.377 --> 01:17:51.552
Do you know how John's play is coming along?

01:17:51.632 --> 01:17:53.667
Very nicely, he tells me.

01:17:54.446 --> 01:17:58.799
You know, there's no need for you
to prepare his nightly cordial, Lizzie.

01:17:58.879 --> 01:18:00.732
I can do it.

01:18:00.812 --> 01:18:03.832
I make one for myself.
It's no more effort to prepare two.

01:18:03.912 --> 01:18:06.066
I'd be happy to make both.

01:18:06.146 --> 01:18:10.821
I could bring yours to your quarters
before I take John's to his.

01:19:56.878 --> 01:19:58.993
- What on earth are you doing here?
- I should ask you the same thing...

01:19:59.073 --> 01:20:01.699
...because I know what it is
you're not doing, and that is writing.

01:20:01.779 --> 01:20:04.399
Why tell me "Misery Junction" was not
finished when it was hardly even begun?

01:20:04.479 --> 01:20:08.529
It was! It's nearly complete.
I've just put it aside for now.

01:20:08.609 --> 01:20:13.066
Put it aside? I support you financially.
I allow that your every need is met!

01:20:13.146 --> 01:20:18.066
Don't pillory me about my damn play
if what really irks you is Aveline.

01:20:18.146 --> 01:20:20.233
Why would that irk me?

01:20:21.662 --> 01:20:25.066
Go home, Lizzie. Let me finish my research.

01:20:25.145 --> 01:20:28.432
Your research? Into what?

01:20:28.512 --> 01:20:31.367
My play. My new play.

01:20:32.646 --> 01:20:34.732
But what of "Misery Junction"?

01:20:34.812 --> 01:20:37.499
I grew tired of Katherine Dove.

01:20:37.839 --> 01:20:39.799
Is there a role in it for me?

01:20:39.879 --> 01:20:42.599
No, Lizzie. There is not.

01:20:42.679 --> 01:20:44.765
You're a lady now...

01:20:44.845 --> 01:20:47.341
...and the stage is no place for a lady.

01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:58.729
You staged it without permission
and it was poorly received.

01:20:58.809 --> 01:21:02.232
"'Misery Junction' leaves
audience in misery, indeed."

01:21:02.612 --> 01:21:06.410
Isn't it funny how the savage reviews are
the ones you can recall word for word?

01:21:11.811 --> 01:21:14.756
- More! More!
- Uncle, please.

01:21:14.836 --> 01:21:17.626
You have stolen my honor! I am innocent!

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:20.432
You wish to be a man?
Just pretend that I'm a women!

01:21:20.512 --> 01:21:23.666
It's Lizzie they're mocking, John.
It's not your play.

01:21:23.746 --> 01:21:26.999
You lie! This was not for me!
This was for you!

01:21:27.079 --> 01:21:29.718
You wish to prove yourself
as an actress, you selfish whore...

01:21:29.798 --> 01:21:32.590
- ...and you failed even at that!
- You are the failure.

01:21:32.946 --> 01:21:34.899
- Jesus!
- See?

01:21:34.979 --> 01:21:37.799
Where's the White Knight now, John?
You are just as all men.

01:21:37.879 --> 01:21:41.491
One more word from your mouth
and I will snap your wretched neck!

01:21:41.571 --> 01:21:42.832
John, go home.

01:21:42.912 --> 01:21:45.606
My play was unfinished and you destroyed it!

01:21:45.686 --> 01:21:48.268
Destroyed me and my reputation!

01:21:48.348 --> 01:21:51.165
You don't have a reputation!
Who do you believe yourself to be?

01:21:51.245 --> 01:21:54.699
You are nobody, John, nobody,
and you never will be!

01:21:54.779 --> 01:21:57.600
Get out of here, John. Out!

01:21:59.178 --> 01:22:01.899
Look at you both. You're clowns.

01:22:01.979 --> 01:22:03.846
Worthless clowns.

01:22:03.926 --> 01:22:07.065
You're the ones who'll be forgotten, not me.

01:22:07.145 --> 01:22:08.588
Not me.

01:22:14.512 --> 01:22:15.966
- John?
- Drive on.

01:22:16.045 --> 01:22:17.732
- John.
- Giddyup!

01:22:17.812 --> 01:22:19.232
John.

01:22:19.312 --> 01:22:20.833
John.

01:22:21.712 --> 01:22:22.746
John!

01:22:22.826 --> 01:22:25.845
That opening night, September the 5th,
it drove him over the edge...

01:22:25.925 --> 01:22:30.025
...but not to suicide. It drove him to
prove to the world that he was an artist.

01:22:30.105 --> 01:22:34.265
That night, the Golem made his first kill,
and you think it's your fault.

01:22:34.345 --> 01:22:37.098
- You're putting words in my mouth.
- Why this dance, Lizzie?

01:22:37.178 --> 01:22:41.028
Why won't you admit that you came to know
or at least suspect what he'd become?

01:22:41.108 --> 01:22:45.534
- If this is a dance, it is you who is leading.
- Let me read you the last entry.

01:22:46.812 --> 01:22:49.232
"Ratcliffe Highway was a tour de force.

01:22:49.312 --> 01:22:52.619
And as an actor may take home
a program as a souvenir...

01:22:52.699 --> 01:22:57.265
...so I returned with a blood-soaked shawl
belonging to the clothes seller's wife.

01:22:57.345 --> 01:23:01.275
The next night, fearful of discovery,
I ventured to destroy it...

01:23:01.355 --> 01:23:03.835
<i>...and therein lay my mistake.</i>

01:23:08.077 --> 01:23:11.065
John, you're home. I didn't hear you come in.

01:23:19.011 --> 01:23:23.154
There were no questions asked,
no recriminations.

01:23:32.177 --> 01:23:35.641
<i>I believe a homemade punishment
may be planned for me instead.</i>

01:23:58.477 --> 01:24:01.129
<i>I no longer feel safe under my own roof.</i>

01:24:03.611 --> 01:24:05.693
<i>I cannot go on like this.</i>

01:24:09.178 --> 01:24:11.204
You poisoned him, didn't you?

01:24:14.579 --> 01:24:16.899
Lizzie, listen to me. We have a few minutes.

01:24:16.978 --> 01:24:20.235
You can still change your plea. Confess.
You did it because you knew what he was.

01:24:20.315 --> 01:24:22.486
You did it because
you were in fear for your life.

01:24:22.566 --> 01:24:24.506
I promise you'll have
the sympathy of the jury.

01:24:24.586 --> 01:24:27.998
- I don't want their sympathy.
- Why do you not deserve redemption?

01:24:28.078 --> 01:24:30.699
Because you killed him or because
you believe you created a monster?

01:24:30.779 --> 01:24:32.563
What I deserve is to live freely...

01:24:32.643 --> 01:24:35.357
...and in death be remembered for
my accomplishments, not as the wife...

01:24:35.437 --> 01:24:38.699
...who poisoned her husband,
my name forever tethered to his.

01:24:39.378 --> 01:24:41.206
Mrs. Cree.

01:24:42.145 --> 01:24:45.364
While that chance remains,
I have no choice but to cling to it.

01:24:52.311 --> 01:24:54.245
<i>Have the jury reached a verdict?</i>

01:24:55.044 --> 01:24:58.995
- Yes, My Lord.
- How do the jury find the defendant?

01:24:59.075 --> 01:25:00.699
Guilty.

01:25:01.278 --> 01:25:04.516
Order! Order!

01:25:04.746 --> 01:25:06.613
Elizabeth Cree...

01:25:06.693 --> 01:25:11.679
...you will be returned to prison and taken
from there to a place of execution...

01:25:11.759 --> 01:25:15.115
<i>...where at 10:00 tomorrow morning,
you will be hanged by the neck...</i>

01:25:15.195 --> 01:25:16.998
<i>...until you are dead.</i>

01:25:17.078 --> 01:25:19.799
<i>May the Lord have mercy on your soul.</i>

01:25:19.878 --> 01:25:23.507
Inspector Kildare, Scotland Yard.
I need a moment with her, please.

01:25:27.281 --> 01:25:29.998
- You don't deserve this.
- It's done. I hang tomorrow at 10:00.

01:25:30.078 --> 01:25:33.098
No. I won't let it happen.
John Cree was a murderer.

01:25:33.178 --> 01:25:37.675
I mean to prove it and appeal for your
pardon. The world needs to know the truth.

01:25:43.578 --> 01:25:45.632
I'd like for you to unmask the Golem.

01:25:45.712 --> 01:25:48.749
This is your moment, your chance.
I'd like for you to have that.

01:25:48.828 --> 01:25:51.106
I'm sorry, sir. We need to leave.

01:25:53.277 --> 01:25:54.832
We don't have much time.

01:25:54.912 --> 01:25:58.105
The manuscript of "Misery Junction"
is handwritten. Dan may still have it.

01:25:58.185 --> 01:26:01.274
I shall stop this. I promise you.

01:26:05.878 --> 01:26:07.902
You filthy...

01:26:23.444 --> 01:26:25.661
Here we are again!

01:26:27.810 --> 01:26:30.099
Lizzie paid for the hire of the theater.

01:26:30.179 --> 01:26:33.466
I advised her against it,
but she was adamant.

01:26:33.546 --> 01:26:35.741
And it was not a success.

01:26:36.778 --> 01:26:38.998
That's putting it mildly.

01:26:39.078 --> 01:26:41.265
So put it any way that you will.

01:26:41.345 --> 01:26:45.666
Barely any tickets sold,
but Lizzie insisted on a full house...

01:26:45.746 --> 01:26:49.147
...so she took to the streets
and gave them away to the poor.

01:26:59.410 --> 01:27:02.241
Here it is. "Misery Junction."

01:27:06.778 --> 01:27:09.032
It's typeset.

01:27:09.112 --> 01:27:12.102
Oh, I don't have the original
manuscript, I'm afraid.

01:27:12.182 --> 01:27:16.030
A usual practice is to have it archived,
unless the author asks for it back...

01:27:16.110 --> 01:27:18.952
- ...which he didn't.
- Archived... where?

01:27:19.412 --> 01:27:22.165
The librarian agreed to open up early, sir.

01:27:22.245 --> 01:27:24.065
He should be here any moment.

01:27:24.145 --> 01:27:27.612
I pray he is. They hang her at 10:00.

01:27:45.612 --> 01:27:47.182
<i>Lizzie!</i>

01:27:53.045 --> 01:27:54.907
<i>Lizzie!</i>

01:28:01.245 --> 01:28:02.831
Lizzie.

01:28:02.911 --> 01:28:04.786
I'm ready.

01:28:17.711 --> 01:28:20.298
But this is most odd. Should be here.

01:28:20.378 --> 01:28:22.432
Could someone have withdrawn it?

01:28:22.512 --> 01:28:24.798
Not unless they did so just now.

01:28:25.388 --> 01:28:28.137
- Quickly, the door.
- Sir!

01:28:33.644 --> 01:28:35.265
Unhand me! I've done nothing wrong.

01:28:35.345 --> 01:28:38.188
Then perhaps you can tell us
why the hurry to obtain this?

01:28:38.268 --> 01:28:41.572
I plan to rewrite it, sir.
Demand a production.

01:28:41.651 --> 01:28:46.532
A topical shocker about Lizzie Cree.
Now she's to be hanged, it'll be a smash.

01:28:46.612 --> 01:28:48.998
Really? So you're a writer now,
are you, Miss Ortega?

01:28:49.078 --> 01:28:52.499
No, sir. But it won't require much work.

01:28:52.579 --> 01:28:54.665
It was the story of her life, after all.

01:28:54.745 --> 01:28:57.998
My idea is to begin the play
at the Gallows...

01:28:58.078 --> 01:29:00.165
...then retrace each step
that led her to them.

01:29:00.245 --> 01:29:04.369
I cannot help but think that the addition
of a murderous husband might be popular.

01:29:04.449 --> 01:29:06.740
I told you all I know, sir.

01:29:07.612 --> 01:29:09.358
John is innocent.

01:29:45.027 --> 01:29:48.332
- Jesus!
- You're the ones who'll be forgotten!

01:29:48.412 --> 01:29:50.220
Not me.

01:29:56.478 --> 01:29:58.498
Is it time?

01:29:58.577 --> 01:29:59.998
There's no one here.

01:30:00.078 --> 01:30:04.658
They hardly ever admit the public these
days, Mrs. Cree. Only for the most hated.

01:30:04.738 --> 01:30:08.526
Please, no. You must help me.
Please. Please tell them to wait.

01:30:08.605 --> 01:30:10.962
- Inspector Kildare is coming.
- I'm sorry.

01:30:11.312 --> 01:30:13.333
Can't you go any faster?

01:30:13.413 --> 01:30:15.698
- Prison's just around the corner.
- I know!

01:30:15.778 --> 01:30:18.769
No, we must wait for him, please.
This is wrong! He will prove it!

01:30:18.849 --> 01:30:22.126
- I beg you, just a little longer!
- I'm sorry.

01:30:26.977 --> 01:30:28.543
Come on!

01:30:53.327 --> 01:30:55.173
Coming through.

01:31:00.676 --> 01:31:04.199
- Steady, sir. Who are you here for?
- Elizabeth Cree. Say I'm not too late.

01:31:04.279 --> 01:31:06.720
They're just taking her down.
Quick as you can.

01:31:07.678 --> 01:31:09.543
Send for the magistrate!

01:31:13.578 --> 01:31:15.927
Stop! Stop!

01:31:26.107 --> 01:31:29.952
Don't thank me yet. All they've given me is
an hour's grace to speak to the magistrate.

01:31:30.032 --> 01:31:32.232
I've still to convince him
to reduce your sentence.

01:31:32.312 --> 01:31:35.565
Don't be glum. You have the Golem.

01:31:35.645 --> 01:31:39.095
The world will know
the real story, and it's you...

01:31:39.175 --> 01:31:43.259
...you who will know
every chapter, who will tell it.

01:31:43.678 --> 01:31:46.702
- You have my gratitude. Always.
- And you mine.

01:31:53.710 --> 01:31:56.241
Lizzie, Lizzie, don't.

01:32:00.710 --> 01:32:03.065
Could any believe John Cree
capable of such deeds?

01:32:03.145 --> 01:32:05.132
I guarantee it.

01:32:05.212 --> 01:32:07.240
Have no doubt.

01:32:09.644 --> 01:32:11.707
Then let us bring this to an end.

01:32:17.877 --> 01:32:20.266
Here's what you will write.

01:32:20.346 --> 01:32:24.565
"I am Elizabeth Cree,
and in September of this year...

01:32:24.645 --> 01:32:27.261
...I came to know that my husband...

01:32:27.341 --> 01:32:29.063
...was the Limehouse Golem."

01:32:29.312 --> 01:32:31.740
All you need to do is tell the truth.

01:32:34.144 --> 01:32:37.182
I have never told you anything
but the truth, Kildare.

01:33:18.595 --> 01:33:20.840
You shall have your moment, and I mine.

01:33:24.584 --> 01:33:28.820
In the temple of fame, our names will be
written side-by-side in stone for all time.

01:33:38.111 --> 01:33:40.199
Who was here on September the 24th?

01:33:40.279 --> 01:33:42.631
There were four men
in the reading room that day...

01:33:42.711 --> 01:33:46.540
...but there's no earthly way of knowing
what anyone read or when they read it.

01:33:50.944 --> 01:33:54.377
John. You're home. I didn't hear you come in.

01:33:57.977 --> 01:34:01.999
<i>There were no questions asked,
no recriminations.</i>

01:34:02.578 --> 01:34:05.627
<i>I believe a homemade punishment
may be planned for me instead.</i>

01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:10.078
<i>I no longer feel safe under my own roof.</i>

01:34:10.677 --> 01:34:12.707
<i>I cannot go on like this.</i>

01:34:15.644 --> 01:34:18.202
<i>Still, we had agreement
to keep each other's secrets.</i>

01:34:18.282 --> 01:34:21.985
<i>And you didn't keep mine, did you?
I wonder what I should do with yours.</i>

01:34:22.065 --> 01:34:24.306
I think you should take it to the grave.

01:35:00.645 --> 01:35:02.373
Mr. Gerrard, sir?

01:35:18.645 --> 01:35:20.174
Annie?

01:35:38.377 --> 01:35:43.084
I know, I know. Few would think
a woman capable of such artistry.

01:36:04.810 --> 01:36:06.896
Here we are again!

01:36:53.110 --> 01:36:54.940
You were too late?

01:36:57.476 --> 01:37:01.098
This... this is probably the last thing
you want at present...

01:37:01.177 --> 01:37:03.260
...but they're waiting for you downstairs.

01:37:05.045 --> 01:37:07.540
You're about to be the toast of London, John.

01:37:14.343 --> 01:37:16.831
I know how much you cared for her.

01:37:16.911 --> 01:37:18.465
Just...

01:37:19.344 --> 01:37:21.756
...know how grateful she would be
that the world will know...

01:37:21.836 --> 01:37:24.798
...what her bastard husband really was.

01:37:24.878 --> 01:37:29.701
Not just as a murderer, but as a man who
sought to deny her all she wanted to be.

01:37:29.781 --> 01:37:32.256
It's you who saved her honor.

01:37:34.443 --> 01:37:36.273
Her memory.

01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:40.974
She would've wanted you to have this.

01:37:58.744 --> 01:38:01.589
No! We must wait for him. Please!
This is wrong, he will prove it!

01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:04.709
- I beg you, just a little longer!
- I...

01:38:05.745 --> 01:38:10.296
I don't believe Inspector Kildare
will be coming back.

01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:18.688
- I am not a poisoner.
- I believe you.

01:38:18.768 --> 01:38:20.665
I am so much more.

01:38:20.745 --> 01:38:26.147
We shall be issuing our full report
on John Cree in an hour, gentlemen.

01:38:26.227 --> 01:38:29.098
Well, it seems the show must go on.

01:38:30.077 --> 01:38:33.898
Londoners can sleep easy in their beds again.

01:38:33.978 --> 01:38:35.831
The Golem is no more.

01:38:35.911 --> 01:38:39.577
Inspector! Inspector,
any comments on your promotion, sir?

01:38:42.331 --> 01:38:45.440
- Any last words?
- Here we are again!

01:40:09.173 --> 01:40:10.977
Let us begin...

01:40:11.057 --> 01:40:12.906
...my friends...

01:40:13.544 --> 01:40:15.386
...at the end.

01:41:08.976 --> 01:41:13.578
Not the green, love, the red.
Mother doesn't get sick until scene four.

01:41:21.159 --> 01:41:23.006
Did anyone check the safety?

01:41:34.343 --> 01:41:36.573
Take her weight. Take...

01:41:40.743 --> 01:41:42.598
What's going on?

01:41:43.477 --> 01:41:45.072
Is she breathing?

01:41:50.810 --> 01:41:53.014
We have to get back out there.

01:41:54.956 --> 01:41:56.980
You're Lizzie's mother now.

01:42:11.410 --> 01:42:12.859
I'll be Lizzie.

01:42:52.194 --> 01:42:53.737
Lizzie!

01:42:54.305 --> 01:43:00.267
