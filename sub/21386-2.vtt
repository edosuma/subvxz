WEBVTT

00:07.884 --> 00:09.420
Kane is in the building, nigga...

00:23.191 --> 00:26.058
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top

00:26.152 --> 00:29.770
When only heaven ’3 right above it, we on

00:30.823 --> 00:33.064
’Cause we on

00:33.159 --> 00:35.901
Who else is really trying to fuck
with Hollywood Cole?

00:35.995 --> 00:37.405
I’m with Marley G, bro

00:37.496 --> 00:40.488
Flying Holly Grove chicks
to my Hollywood shows

00:40.583 --> 00:43.700
And / wanna tell you
something that you probably should know

00:43.794 --> 00:46.706
This that
Slumdog Millionaire Bol/ywood flow

00:46.797 --> 00:48.333
And...

00:48.424 --> 00:50.540
My real friends never hearing from me

00:50.635 --> 00:53.752
Fake friends write the wrong
answers on the mirror for me

00:53.846 --> 00:56.838
That’s why / pick and choose
/ don ’t get shit confused

00:56.933 --> 01:00.175
Don ’t like my women sing/e
/ like my chicks in twos

01:00.519 --> 01:03.181
And these days
all the girls is down to roll

01:03.272 --> 01:05.558
/ hit the strip club
and all them bitches ﬁnd the pole

01:06.359 --> 01:09.567
Plus, lbeen sippin’
So this shit is movin’ kinda slow

01:09.654 --> 01:13.397
Just tell my girl
to tell her friend that it’s time to go

01:37.640 --> 01:39.676
RICKY: Oh, Shit!

01:39.767 --> 01:40.927
-Ooh.
-Yes, sir.

01:41.018 --> 01:43.475
Yes, sir. I can't thank y'all
enough for this shit.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.769
Need to slip my female problems
for a few days.

01:45.856 --> 01:47.312
A getaway will do wonders.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.231
Hey, nothing says escape like Sin City.

01:49.318 --> 01:51.400
Ain't gonna be
no sinning for me. Too risky.

01:51.487 --> 01:54.103
Tell me about it.
I've knocked up my share of Showgirls.

01:54.198 --> 01:55.779
I'm sure Spence has snapped one

01:55.866 --> 01:57.822
past the goalie
with a cheerleader or two.

01:57.910 --> 01:59.901
Well, you know, it happens
to the best of us, boys.

01:59.996 --> 02:01.361
We still need to see a show,

02:01.455 --> 02:03.491
and I hear Britney Spears
is a hot ticket.

02:03.582 --> 02:05.789
All I'm hitting is a first-class
spa treatment,

02:05.876 --> 02:07.491
followed by a meal fit for a king.

02:07.586 --> 02:09.042
I'll get you into Momofuku.

02:09.130 --> 02:11.086
-Best Asian in town.
-Momo-what?

02:11.173 --> 02:12.788
Not before I hit that craps table.

02:12.883 --> 02:14.419
You know I'm sick on those dice.

02:14.510 --> 02:15.795
Not with my money, you not.

02:15.886 --> 02:17.422
-Hold up.
-I gotta get to the office.

02:17.513 --> 02:19.754
We're negotiating
Travis Scott's residency deal.

02:19.849 --> 02:22.386
Ah, Travis is my boy.
Make sure you give him a dab for me.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.262
-What's that?
-Never mind.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.803
This is Sara.
She'll get you to your suite.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.683
Good luck with the Mayor Meg meeting.

02:28.774 --> 02:30.435
Thank you for setting it up.
I'll call you later.

02:30.526 --> 02:33.313
JOE: Oh, God, I hate
your fucking guts for not bringing me.

02:33.404 --> 02:36.020
SPENCER: Listen, it’s a business trip.
It’s not a bachelor party.

02:36.115 --> 02:38.401
JOE: Yeah, right,
keep telling yourself that one, pal.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.357
Did you tell Anderson yet
that God spoke

02:40.453 --> 02:42.944
and told you to Moses
a football franchise to the Mojave?

02:43.039 --> 02:45.701
His ass is still raw
over Hastings killing his casino idea.

02:45.791 --> 02:46.826
He's still down, though.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.953
Don't turn this into
a five-day fuckfest, okay?

02:49.045 --> 02:50.876
We got a lot of shit
popping off right now.

02:50.963 --> 02:52.499
And not having you
isn’t gonna make it easy.

02:52.590 --> 02:54.751
Joe, l have all the confidence
in the world in you.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.208
Yeah. (PHONE BEEPS)
Oh, that's Virginia.

02:57.303 --> 02:59.089
Go fuck yourself!

02:59.805 --> 03:01.181
Hey, I'll be up in a minute.

03:01.265 --> 03:03.176
-What’s going on?
-Boss man is on the line

03:03.267 --> 03:05.553
and been getting
Spencer's voicemail all morning.

03:05.644 --> 03:06.770
Says it’s an emergency.

03:06.979 --> 03:08.719
-Yeah, put him through.
-Got it.

03:09.273 --> 03:10.308
DALLAS COWBOYS OWNER: Strasmore?

03:10.399 --> 03:12.355
No, it's his partner, Joe Krutel.

03:12.443 --> 03:14.775
How's our favorite
Dallas Cowboys executive

03:14.862 --> 03:15.942
this ﬁne morning?

03:16.030 --> 03:19.443
Have you seen Vernon Littelfield's
recent wardrobe choices on lnstagram?

03:19.533 --> 03:22.650
No. What, is he mixing
stripes and plaids again?

03:22.745 --> 03:25.236
You clearly don't grasp
the gravity of the situation.

03:25.331 --> 03:27.492
| suggest you talk to that young man.

03:27.625 --> 03:28.740
Immediately.

03:33.631 --> 03:35.167
Oh, motherfucker!

03:35.257 --> 03:36.292
(SIGHS)

03:36.384 --> 03:37.749
-Virginial
-Yes?

03:37.843 --> 03:40.630
Get Vern and Reg
on the phone for me right now, please.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.552
Sizzle wants an appraisal on his boat.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.426
And Kisan Teague has serious issues...

03:44.517 --> 03:47.930
For the love of all
that's holy, Virginia,

03:48.020 --> 03:50.056
get Vern and Reg
on the phone right now.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.604
-Joe, Kisan is...
-Has issues. I know.

03:52.691 --> 03:56.309
The whole fucking world knows
that Kisan Teague has fucking issues.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.065
But right now, Kisan Teague

03:58.155 --> 03:59.986
can Kisan my pasty white ass.

04:00.783 --> 04:03.525
Hey, Kee-san! How are you?

04:03.619 --> 04:05.029
l was just about to call you.

04:05.746 --> 04:06.861
Ah. (CLEARS THROAT)

04:06.956 --> 04:08.036
Everything cool?

04:08.124 --> 04:09.864
Nah. It's Kah-san.

04:09.959 --> 04:12.075
-What did I say?
-I need a new fucking agent.

04:12.169 --> 04:13.750
-Oh, yeah, easy.
-Yeah, but first,

04:13.838 --> 04:15.954
you can start by dropping
them draws, though,

04:16.090 --> 04:17.296
so my boy Cliff

04:17.967 --> 04:19.958
can kiss on that "pasty white ass."

04:20.052 --> 04:21.428
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

04:22.138 --> 04:25.471
No, when l... Whoa.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.548
It's getting a little real, Cliff.

04:27.977 --> 04:29.467
-Blink.
-The fucking agent, Joe!

04:29.562 --> 04:31.427
-What the fuck?
-Get Jason on the phone?

04:31.522 --> 04:33.604
God! I mean, she's new...

04:33.691 --> 04:34.851
She's not working out.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.273
I'm so sorry, Mr. Carter,

04:36.360 --> 04:37.770
the Cousteau Suite is booked,

04:37.862 --> 04:39.898
but the Presidential Suite
is even nicer.

04:40.114 --> 04:42.571
Sir, does it have a giant aquarium

04:42.950 --> 04:44.906
with iridescent fish?

04:45.411 --> 04:47.242
Any man
with 1,100 catches...

04:47.329 --> 04:49.581
-Whoa!
-...and a gold jacket deserves his fish.

04:49.665 --> 04:51.747
1,101, Spence.
It's good to see you, man.

04:51.834 --> 04:54.075
-lt's good to see you, too.
-lt's been a minute.

04:54.170 --> 04:55.751
-Yeah, man.
-It has been a minute.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.133
Don't melt down, big guy.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.333
-(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Hi.
-Hi.

05:02.595 --> 05:05.712
-Wow. I haven't seen this one in...
-lt's been quite some time.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.513
Urn, actually, Wayne put you
in the Cousteau Suite,

05:08.601 --> 05:11.434
so why don't we just swap rooms?
High-class problems?

05:11.520 --> 05:13.181
-You don't mind?
-No, I don't mind.

05:13.272 --> 05:15.228
I look more presidential
than you, anyway.

05:15.316 --> 05:17.181
Well, that ain't
saying much these days.

05:17.276 --> 05:18.982
-l'll catch you later.
-Let's do it.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.104
All right, Cris.

05:20.196 --> 05:21.606
Wow, it's nice to see

05:21.697 --> 05:23.562
you're still making huge sacrifices

05:23.657 --> 05:26.069
for the comfort
and well-being of others.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.821
l have enough marine life in Miami.

05:27.912 --> 05:29.493
Yeah, how is Miami?

05:29.580 --> 05:30.615
Sexy.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.910
Miami isjust beautiful.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.582
-You know how it is. It's...
-Yeah.

05:37.713 --> 05:40.295
Wow, so, here.
You still work here, huh?

05:40.424 --> 05:43.507
Yes. Yep, l...l do.

05:43.594 --> 05:45.459
Yeah, you got a lot of stuff to do. Go.

05:45.554 --> 05:47.545
Go work, and maybe
we'll catch up later.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.801
-I do know where to find you.
-Yeah.

05:55.773 --> 05:58.059
-Yeahl
-T, hold up, bro.

05:58.150 --> 05:59.936
Man, don't kill my motherfucking joy.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.187
You know I don't gamble.

06:01.278 --> 06:04.236
What do you call not wrapping yourjoint
before giving Amber a poke?

06:04.323 --> 06:07.065
If you wanna shoot dice, that's fine,
but let's be quiet about this.

06:07.159 --> 06:10.492
-l'm trying to keep this trip low-key.
-Okay, man. Jesus.

06:10.579 --> 06:12.615
Come on, fellas, set 'em up.
Here we go.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.322
-Yeah, ready?
-Welcome, gentlemen.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.748
Give me some scratch, Rick?

06:17.378 --> 06:18.413
Hold on.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.085
-$500? That's light.
-That's all you get.

06:21.173 --> 06:23.334
-That's all you get. All you get.
-lt's Vegas.

06:23.676 --> 06:24.791
$500.

06:25.886 --> 06:26.921
Oh, there it is.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.556
Oh, put it right there.
Here we go.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.884
-You like this shit, huh?
-Grab two, man.

06:31.976 --> 06:33.841
Make this a night to remember.
Let's go.

06:37.481 --> 06:40.348
This is why I don't fucking gamble.
You know what I'm saying?

06:40.442 --> 06:42.057
Get your head in the game, Greane.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.403
We run this down one time,

06:43.487 --> 06:45.398
then we delete it from
our minds forever.

06:45.489 --> 06:46.524
-Cool?
-Cool.

06:46.615 --> 06:47.695
All right.

06:47.783 --> 06:49.739
And we are now moving
in a new direction.

06:49.827 --> 06:51.567
REPORTER: And what direction is that?

06:52.538 --> 06:54.574
Right there. That's where you lost them.

06:54.665 --> 06:56.826
You paused and looked away
before answering the question.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.999
-l was looking for the answer.
-Baby, you need to have the answer.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.201
But I didn't have the answer.

07:00.296 --> 07:02.503
Make them think
you have the answer.

07:02.631 --> 07:05.293
Look how you're sitting
with your shoulders all slumped.

07:05.384 --> 07:07.375
And when you bulge
your eyes out like that,

07:07.469 --> 07:09.209
although hilarious and adorable,

07:09.305 --> 07:10.715
it does zilch for your cred.

07:12.349 --> 07:13.384
So, what I'd do right?

07:13.475 --> 07:14.976
Well, you didn't curse or cry,

07:15.060 --> 07:16.596
so that's something to build on.

07:18.230 --> 07:21.222
Baby, when I give
my patients bad news,

07:21.317 --> 07:24.059
l deliver it as directly
and dispassionately as I can.

07:24.570 --> 07:27.357
I'm not cold or cruel,
but I don't sugarcoat it.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.064
Charles...

07:30.909 --> 07:31.989
You're dying.

07:32.620 --> 07:33.735
I don't like this game.

07:33.829 --> 07:35.945
You just deliver the information
and get out,

07:36.040 --> 07:38.782
because chances are you're gonna
have to do it over again.

07:38.876 --> 07:39.911
See, the problem is

07:40.002 --> 07:42.084
l have no clue
as to why we fired our OC.

07:42.254 --> 07:43.334
Doesn't matter.

07:44.214 --> 07:45.954
Time to wipe the slate clean, Greane.

07:46.342 --> 07:47.957
It's a new day
for the Black Swan.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.211
(LAUGHS) Wow.

07:52.306 --> 07:55.013
Another great drive, Mayor.
That's three in a row.

07:55.267 --> 07:56.848
Fifty years of practice pays off.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.350
-lt's more than I can say for you.
-Ah.

08:00.022 --> 08:01.478
You talking about my golf game

08:01.565 --> 08:04.102
or that I want
to bring a football team here to Vegas?

08:04.360 --> 08:06.942
It's not easy convincing the taxpayers

08:07.112 --> 08:09.819
and the stadium committee
to pay for something they see

08:09.907 --> 08:12.649
as the most expensive
tourist trap on the planet.

08:12.743 --> 08:14.699
Okay, well, let me try. All right?

08:14.787 --> 08:17.529
I can alter the perception
of Vegas as Sin City,

08:17.831 --> 08:20.698
and what happens in Vegas
doesn't need to stay here.

08:20.793 --> 08:22.704
We made a fortune on that slogan.

08:22.878 --> 08:25.244
-You want to change it?
-No. No, ldon't want to.

08:25.339 --> 08:28.046
I love the slogan,
but I want to give it greater context.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.385
I need the league to know
there's a lot of good,

08:30.469 --> 08:32.050
hardworking people here in Vegas.

08:32.137 --> 08:34.844
-You know that.
-But you're not a local.

08:34.932 --> 08:37.048
What makes you think
they're gonna trust you?

08:37.142 --> 08:39.679
I've been doing
my off-season training here for years.

08:39.770 --> 08:41.476
Plus, who else are you gonna trust

08:41.563 --> 08:44.350
to push football in Vegas,
Siegfried and Roy?

08:44.441 --> 08:47.023
Listen, I really, really applaud

08:47.111 --> 08:48.191
your aggressive play.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.143
You're just like you were on the field.

08:50.239 --> 08:52.104
But Councilman Sawyerjust won't budge,

08:52.199 --> 08:54.360
and he's very influential
with the committee.

08:55.202 --> 08:58.160
But if by some miracle
you can convince him

08:58.247 --> 09:00.488
to use public money to fund the stadium,

09:01.458 --> 09:02.743
you have my support.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.291
Take him to dinner tonight.

09:04.378 --> 09:07.040
-l'll make the introductions.
-I love it! Thank you.

09:07.131 --> 09:08.337
Give me some, Mayor.

09:08.424 --> 09:10.710
And I'm gonna find a place
with air conditioning.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.055
(PHONE BUZZES)

09:30.237 --> 09:31.397
Fuck this.

09:34.867 --> 09:36.607
JOE: Yo, J., how’d it go with Kisan?

09:36.702 --> 09:38.238
-He's a no-show.
-What?

09:38.328 --> 09:40.785
Motherfucker!
He said he needed an agent.

09:40.873 --> 09:43.159
He was dying to meet you.
He must've got held up.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.036
Yeah, well,
I don't like being tested.

09:45.127 --> 09:47.869
I don't like waiting,
especially for a running back.

09:48.797 --> 09:51.254
So I'm ghost.
You solve that shit for Vern?

09:51.341 --> 09:53.172
JOE: Yeah, I’m on my way right now.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.171
All right, pick up the pace, Joe-Joe.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.298
If those pictures
start to get reposted,

09:57.389 --> 09:58.890
Vern ’s in deep shit.

09:59.183 --> 10:00.423
(HORNS HONKING)

10:00.517 --> 10:01.632
(TIRES SCREECHING)

10:02.102 --> 10:03.137
Fuck!

10:04.938 --> 10:07.099
Hey, yo, my man.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.310
You lost?

10:09.401 --> 10:10.481
Uh...

10:10.903 --> 10:13.440
No.
I'm waiting for my friend, Kisan Teague.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.316
-You know him?
-No, no.

10:15.407 --> 10:16.817
I'm from Palm Beach, brother.

10:16.909 --> 10:19.867
-Okay.
-Hey, can I borrow $5?

10:20.537 --> 10:23.870
We low on gas and I, uh... (CHUCKLES)

10:23.957 --> 10:25.618
I forgot my wallet at home.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.001
Yeah, uh...

10:31.799 --> 10:32.879
Here's $40.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.752
It's all I got, so fill her up.

10:34.843 --> 10:37.425
Oh, man, thanks. Hey, yo, yo, yo.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.516
-Can I borrow that phone?
-Come on, man.

10:45.771 --> 10:48.308
The phone's my life.
My entire business depends on it,

10:48.398 --> 10:50.980
so, no, you can't borrow my phone.

10:51.568 --> 10:52.683
(GUN CLICKS)

10:53.737 --> 10:54.977
It's gonna be the phone

10:55.072 --> 10:56.608
or it's gonna be something else.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.781
You're fucking with me, right?

10:59.868 --> 11:03.281
Like, this is Kisan just trying to
put my feet to the fire or something?

11:03.372 --> 11:05.112
I told you, don't know no Kisan.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.036
Look.

11:11.797 --> 11:13.003
It's 500 bucks.

11:13.090 --> 11:15.001
No phone. It's final offer.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.389
Have a nice day, bitch! Let's roll.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.928
My friend, you're caught
in a fucking shit show.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.183
Yeah, I need to figure out
who's directing it.

11:31.275 --> 11:33.391
No, we have to figure out
who's loyal to you.

11:34.611 --> 11:35.771
Well...

11:35.863 --> 11:37.649
I guess the easy answer is Siefert.

11:37.990 --> 11:40.356
I mean, he did bring me back
for that last season.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.702
Then again, he also
unceremoniously cut me.

11:42.786 --> 11:45.027
He hired you
to ride his hip in front office.

11:45.122 --> 11:46.658
Yeah, and I got to admit,

11:46.748 --> 11:48.830
I love this job
as much as playing the game.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.373
You're still playing the game.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.246
Feels better on your body on Mondays.

11:52.337 --> 11:54.999
You're in a different type
of trench now, front office politics.

11:55.090 --> 11:57.126
Can't just assume
it was Siefert who cut you.

11:57.217 --> 12:01.301
He could've been covering for somebody.
Just saying. Maybe... Berg.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.971
Berg shot it straight
with me ever since he got there.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.434
My thing is I've already
seen one coach get fired.

12:06.518 --> 12:08.474
I don't want to see it
happen to him, too.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.177
Until you guys beat the Patriots,

12:10.272 --> 12:11.978
nobody in that building is safe.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.978
Not the head coach, not the GM, not you.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.150
Fuck, your parking lot
attendant's not safe.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.649
Listen, the walls
in that building have ears.

12:19.948 --> 12:22.030
Maybe not as big as those,
but they got ears.

12:22.117 --> 12:24.153
It's myjob to listen
to those walls.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.360
I got that covered.
You just watch your back.

12:26.455 --> 12:28.571
-Got me? You got it.
-Thanks, Glaze.

12:28.749 --> 12:31.707
Dallas is freaking out about you guys
promoting a weed company.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.368
High Powered is a cannabis company.

12:34.463 --> 12:35.703
Potato, potato.

12:37.674 --> 12:38.925
What the fuck is this?

12:39.134 --> 12:40.635
A big-ass sack of "potahtoes."

12:40.761 --> 12:41.796
Uh-huh.

12:42.554 --> 12:43.634
All right.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.596
-Mother of God.
-Exactly.

12:46.767 --> 12:49.975
200K to wear a damn T-shirt and hat.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.394
You and Spence didn't get Vern

12:52.481 --> 12:55.063
one single endorsement deal, so I did.

12:55.192 --> 12:56.728
Well, I got news for you, Reg.

12:57.319 --> 12:58.604
Vern's not a quarterback.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.435
-And he's not JJ or Suh.
-Yet.

13:00.530 --> 13:01.690
And even if he were,

13:01.823 --> 13:03.950
Mickey D's isn't handing out
endorsement deals

13:04.034 --> 13:05.899
to a DT tied
to a weed company.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.780
Man, I told your ass it's cannabis.

13:07.871 --> 13:10.362
Nobody gives a fuck
about the semantics, Reg!

13:10.624 --> 13:12.831
Cannabis makes weed,
weed makes people high.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.533
That makes the team and the league

13:14.628 --> 13:15.868
very fucking nervous.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.828
It's hypocritical as hell, I know,

13:17.923 --> 13:19.254
but that's the way it is.

13:19.841 --> 13:22.048
So, please, let us
get you into something

13:22.135 --> 13:23.796
a little less polarizing, huh?

13:23.887 --> 13:26.879
I got a new client with a cutting-edge
virtual reality company.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.719
We're more down with real reality.

13:30.602 --> 13:33.218
Now, do your fucking job
and put this through the wash.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.519
Aah!

13:35.524 --> 13:36.889
(ALL CHEERING)

13:37.109 --> 13:39.566
-What do you think, RJ?
-You know what I'm thinking.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.063
Take the odds
behind the line...

13:41.154 --> 13:42.735
-For 40 dimes.
-4O dimes.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.646
I'd put a mi! on the come-up,

13:44.741 --> 13:46.151
let it fly like a real nigga.

13:46.243 --> 13:48.859
Man, listen to the pro.
Don't listen to no Joe, man.

13:48.954 --> 13:51.036
I told you about Joe shit.
Watch your mouth.

13:51.123 --> 13:52.533
I can relate to that, though.

13:52.624 --> 13:54.125
-Ricky, relate to this.
-Bam!

13:54.334 --> 13:56.916
I gotta go with RJ.
In RJ we trust, baby.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.414
What's up?
Blow on them, baby.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.745
-Here we go.
-Let's get it.

13:59.840 --> 14:00.920
Tuition paid!

14:01.049 --> 14:02.505
Yeah!

14:02.592 --> 14:03.843
That's how you do it!

14:05.429 --> 14:06.464
SPENCER: Playing already?

14:07.014 --> 14:09.221
-Man, our boy on fire.
-He's actually playing?

14:09.307 --> 14:10.808
Yeah. He up, like, halfa mil.

14:10.892 --> 14:13.099
He keeps this up,
you ain't got to pay him back

14:13.186 --> 14:14.301
the $5 mil you owe him.

14:14.396 --> 14:15.761
Man, come get in this bitch.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.187
Okay, let's do this.

14:18.150 --> 14:19.606
-Here we go.
-What you got?

14:19.693 --> 14:21.684
-$2,000 on the field of dreams.
-(CHEERING)

14:21.778 --> 14:22.813
Yeah, bitch!

14:22.904 --> 14:24.360
This is your getaway.

14:24.448 --> 14:26.985
-This is your getaway. My lucky charm.
-All right.

14:27.075 --> 14:29.407
-Come on, Ricky J., a little blessing.
-lgotyou.

14:29.494 --> 14:30.950
-Here we go.
-Hold your breath.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.120
Sexy motherfucker up in this.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.537
(CROWD CHEERING)

14:37.127 --> 14:38.958
-Yes.
-Hey, run that back, bruh.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.957
-Here we go, here we go.
-BIaCk.

14:41.048 --> 14:43.585
A sexy and smart motherfucker
takes his money and run.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.540
-l'm out. Deuces.
-That ain't sexy, man!

14:45.635 --> 14:47.341
-Get out of here.
-That is not sexy.

14:49.765 --> 14:52.256
Of all the casinos in all the world,

14:52.684 --> 14:53.890
you walk into this one.

14:53.977 --> 14:55.558
It's not like it's my first time.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.556
It's your first time in over five years.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.310
I figured you'd be
running Viacom by now.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.733
It's hard to leave
when Wayne keeps promoting me.

15:04.446 --> 15:06.232
-You guys working on something?
-Yeah.

15:06.531 --> 15:08.317
I'm gonna bring
pro football to Vegas.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.648
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

15:10.035 --> 15:11.775
You and everyone else.

15:11.870 --> 15:14.657
Well, everyone else doesn't have
Mayor Rosen's support.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.290
Wow, you're working fast.

15:19.211 --> 15:20.872
Just like our first date.

15:21.379 --> 15:23.665
That was the best 97 seconds
of your life.

15:23.757 --> 15:24.917
(BOTH LAUGHING)

15:25.926 --> 15:26.961
Ugh...

15:27.094 --> 15:29.881
So, if! hadn't caught you in Check-in,

15:30.555 --> 15:32.967
were you gonna look me up
or try and duck me?

15:33.266 --> 15:36.303
When you were down in Miami
breaking new ground on Wayne's hotel,

15:36.520 --> 15:37.805
did you try and look me up?

15:37.896 --> 15:39.102
I sure as hell didn't.

15:41.942 --> 15:42.977
Why not?

15:46.905 --> 15:48.315
You better make it a quickie,

15:48.615 --> 15:50.321
'Cause my girls are waiting for me.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.569
Well, you better call
and ask for forgiveness,

15:52.661 --> 15:54.526
'Cause you're about to be late as fuck.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.781
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.199
I've got five years
of fantasies about you

16:00.293 --> 16:01.624
I'm about ready to roll out.

16:02.003 --> 16:03.914
Then what the fuck
are you waiting for?

16:14.182 --> 16:15.797
Your girls can wait, by the way.

16:15.892 --> 16:17.928
-(GIGGLES)
-Don't even put me on the Clock.

16:28.530 --> 16:29.861
Yo, best agent in Miami.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.981
-What's up, boy?
-I want my money back.

16:32.075 --> 16:33.485
What are you talking about?

16:33.577 --> 16:35.659
You know, with your shitty
gangbanger image,

16:35.745 --> 16:37.610
you need me a lot more than I need you,

16:37.706 --> 16:40.914
so remember, next time you make
someone wait in the park for an hour

16:41.001 --> 16:43.287
and then send your homeboys
up there to rob him.

16:43.461 --> 16:44.496
What, you got robbed?

16:44.588 --> 16:46.294
Yeah. Don't play dumb.

16:46.381 --> 16:47.791
-Hey, watch your mouth.
-Yeah.

16:47.883 --> 16:50.090
Have some brussels sprouts.
They're delicious.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.212
Come on, man, look.

16:51.303 --> 16:53.510
I couldn't make that meet
'Cause my niece got sick.

16:53.597 --> 16:55.883
Honest to God,
I had to pick her up from school.

16:55.974 --> 16:57.805
What the guy look like?
You get a look?

16:57.893 --> 17:00.100
l...l know better than
to eyeball a stickup man.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.143
He was in a green Cutlass, Kisan.

17:04.566 --> 17:05.851
Let's take a ride, huh?

17:07.819 --> 17:10.060
Come on, man,
fuck the brussels sprouts. Damn!

17:15.035 --> 17:16.525
Wow, beautiful.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.744
Yeah, well, you can
call it that, I guess.

17:20.749 --> 17:22.705
Shit, Bob, ldidn't
even think to ask you.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.453
Do you even like Asian fusion?

17:24.669 --> 17:27.206
Oh, is that what they call this stuff?
"Asian fusion"?

17:27.380 --> 17:28.836
-Yeah...
-(LAUGHS)

17:28.924 --> 17:31.210
Cut that bird!
What the hell do you think we are?

17:31.301 --> 17:33.041
A bunch of Neanderthals around here?

17:33.136 --> 17:34.751
I fucking love
this place.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.256
(BOTH LAUGHING)

17:36.389 --> 17:38.345
All right. Well, you know what? Cheers.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.799
-All right.
-Cheers to keeping an open mind

17:40.894 --> 17:42.850
and the promise of the public interest.

17:45.982 --> 17:47.643
Now... Now hold on just a second.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.017
You expect me to believe
that you wanna bring

17:50.111 --> 17:51.851
a team here for the public interest?

17:51.947 --> 17:54.438
-ls that so hard?
-Well, now, son, people around here

17:54.532 --> 17:57.274
don't want their tax dollars going
to cover half a stadium

17:57.369 --> 17:59.325
so some rich assholes
can get even richer.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.528
But think about all the jobs
it's gonna create.

18:01.623 --> 18:02.703
But at what cost?

18:02.791 --> 18:05.157
It might even take money
away from other programs.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.868
But, Bob, it's also gonna create
a lot of opportunities.

18:07.963 --> 18:10.045
It's gonna make people
stay here till Monday

18:10.131 --> 18:13.214
and not try and fly out early
Sunday morning like everybody does.

18:13.301 --> 18:16.043
If they're sober enough
to catch their flights, that is.

18:16.721 --> 18:18.052
I gotta tell you something.

18:18.139 --> 18:20.130
I'm surprised you're opposed
to this, man.

18:22.310 --> 18:23.550
You must be a soccer guy.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.186
Arsenal. That's my guess.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.767
Nah, we like to stack our odds

18:31.861 --> 18:34.273
a little bit in our favor,
if you know what I mean.

18:34.364 --> 18:38.107
But then again, you probably don't know
because after all, you are a tourist.

18:42.372 --> 18:43.908
I'll show you a fucking tourist.

18:57.345 --> 18:59.427
-Listen, listen.
-Hell, yeah! What? What?

18:59.514 --> 19:00.549
We're there.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.382
-Do not give this stack back.
-The fuck you talking about?

19:03.476 --> 19:04.932
-What you think?
-Time to walk.

19:05.020 --> 19:07.261
You know me.
I ain't even Check out these Chips!

19:07.355 --> 19:09.471
-Don't listen to that nigga.
-We wideouts.

19:09.566 --> 19:11.306
We ain't afraid to go
across the middle.

19:11.401 --> 19:12.516
Listen to RJ, man.

19:12.610 --> 19:15.568
Let's take this and go
to Sapphire's and blow it the right way.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.156
The plan worked. Don't deviate.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.741
-Don't deviate!
