00:00.898 --> 00:02.257
<i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>

00:02.329 --> 00:03.360
THOMPKINS: What's your record

00:03.438 --> 00:06.338
for how many banks
you've robbed in one day?

00:06.441 --> 00:08.867
GORDON: You can't take ownership
of everyone's problems.

00:08.945 --> 00:10.144
THOMPKINS: We all have our flaws.

00:10.246 --> 00:12.046
But you're still breaking the law.

00:12.148 --> 00:14.966
JEROME: <i>I want you to throw me a wake.</i>

00:15.044 --> 00:16.317
<i>Dig me up.</i>

00:20.059 --> 00:21.722
NYGMA: I would liberate Lee Thompkins

00:21.825 --> 00:23.057
with surgical precision.

00:23.159 --> 00:24.559
Dead or alive,

00:24.661 --> 00:27.361
- Jerome uses distractions.
- Got a plan for that?

00:27.464 --> 00:28.996
Bruce?

00:29.098 --> 00:30.231
Jeremiah.

00:31.434 --> 00:32.867
Oh, God, no.

00:32.969 --> 00:33.935
He's still alive.

00:35.004 --> 00:38.139
JEREMIAH: Jerome is dead.

00:39.275 --> 00:40.741
Long live me.

00:40.844 --> 00:42.521
I could not have done any of this...

00:43.279 --> 00:44.912
...without your help.

00:45.014 --> 00:47.081
Those generators that we built...

00:48.451 --> 00:50.151
...work even better as bombs.

00:51.054 --> 00:52.720
(explosion)

00:52.822 --> 00:54.522
(alarms blaring)

00:57.460 --> 00:59.293
<i>Sources tell us Captain James Gordon</i>

00:59.395 --> 01:02.730
<i>was at the scene
and is missing and feared dead.</i>

01:02.832 --> 01:04.866
<i>Investigators are certainly looking into</i>

01:04.968 --> 01:07.468
<i>what could have caused
the sudden explosion.</i>

01:07.570 --> 01:09.136
Harvey.

01:09.239 --> 01:11.205
I just got off the phone
with Search and Rescue.

01:11.307 --> 01:13.040
Whatever blew Jeremiah's bunker

01:13.142 --> 01:14.208
was catastrophic.

01:14.310 --> 01:15.576
There are no signs of life.

01:15.678 --> 01:16.711
Tell 'em to keep looking.

01:16.813 --> 01:17.879
- Harvey, I think...
- Listen.

01:17.981 --> 01:20.948
Jim found his way out, understand?

01:21.050 --> 01:23.150
NEWSWOMAN: <i>...has dispatched
an investigative unit,</i>

01:23.253 --> 01:25.086
<i>which is currently canvassing the area,</i>

01:25.188 --> 01:27.455
<i>looking for any traces
of Captain Gordon.</i>

01:27.557 --> 01:29.555
Screw that, and screw her.

01:29.634 --> 01:31.325
Listen, in two minutes, Jim Gordon's

01:31.427 --> 01:32.760
gonna come walking through that door

01:32.862 --> 01:34.095
and chew all your asses out

01:34.197 --> 01:36.731
for standing around
and not doing your job.

01:36.833 --> 01:38.924
Now, first responders
are on the scene. I want CSIs

01:39.035 --> 01:40.968
out there pronto, and I want

01:41.070 --> 01:43.237
everyone looking for Jeremiah Valeska

01:43.339 --> 01:44.405
and Bruce Wayne.

01:44.507 --> 01:46.073
That's who Jim was looking for

01:46.175 --> 01:48.009
- when this whole thing went blooey.
- You ain't the captain.

01:48.111 --> 01:49.110
The captain ain't here.

01:49.212 --> 01:50.444
I'm ranking detective.

01:50.547 --> 01:51.913
Last time we followed you,

01:52.015 --> 01:53.681
the Pyg slaughtered us.

01:56.185 --> 01:59.153
All right, look, enough.

01:59.255 --> 02:00.755
Jim trusts him, okay?

02:00.857 --> 02:02.723
So everybody get back to work.

02:05.728 --> 02:07.361
ALVAREZ: Harvey.

02:09.065 --> 02:12.222
Jeremiah Valeska wasn't
inside the bunker when it blew.

02:12.268 --> 02:13.323
How do you know?

02:13.409 --> 02:15.069
'Cause he's outside, and he's not alone.

02:17.607 --> 02:19.574
What the hell?

02:21.311 --> 02:23.511
You might not recognize
Jerome's followers,

02:23.613 --> 02:25.780
as I've given them
something of a makeover.

02:25.882 --> 02:27.481
But I assure you, they're as loyal to me

02:27.584 --> 02:28.950
as they ever were to him.

02:29.052 --> 02:30.518
More so.

02:30.620 --> 02:33.521
'Cause I accomplished something
my brother never could:

02:33.623 --> 02:35.890
killing James Gordon.

02:35.992 --> 02:37.058
CULTISTS: Jeremiah! Jeremiah!

02:37.160 --> 02:38.326
You're a liar!

02:38.428 --> 02:41.829
Not so fast.

02:41.931 --> 02:44.665
I have bombs planted around the city,

02:44.767 --> 02:47.668
just like the one
that killed Jim Gordon.

02:47.770 --> 02:50.004
CULTISTS: Jeremiah! Jeremiah!

02:52.408 --> 02:55.484
All you need to know is,
if I hit this detonator,

02:55.578 --> 02:57.878
Gotham is blown back to the Stone Age.

02:57.981 --> 02:59.814
If I pull this trigger,

02:59.916 --> 03:02.950
your brains are blown
through the back of your skull.

03:05.121 --> 03:08.322
Dead man's switch. You're familiar.

03:08.424 --> 03:10.432
It's another little something
I took from my brother,

03:10.510 --> 03:13.227
except mine's a bit more advanced.

03:13.329 --> 03:16.364
You shoot me, my thumb loosens,

03:16.466 --> 03:19.834
and then boom, boom,

03:19.936 --> 03:22.850
boom, boom.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.905
No, you will do what I say.

03:25.008 --> 03:28.009
- You're more sick than your brother.
- (chuckles)

03:28.111 --> 03:31.379
Don't compare me to that
short-sighted psychopath.

03:31.481 --> 03:33.514
He just wanted to destroy things.

03:33.616 --> 03:35.916
Me, I'm a builder.

03:36.019 --> 03:39.220
I'm gonna create
a new Gotham in my image.

03:39.322 --> 03:43.290
But every artist
needs a blank canvas, so...

03:43.393 --> 03:44.959
all of this has to go.

03:45.061 --> 03:47.795
I detonate the explosives in six hours.

03:47.897 --> 03:49.697
I want the city empty when I do.

03:49.799 --> 03:52.433
You need us to evacuate
Gotham in six hours?

03:52.535 --> 03:54.101
That's impossible!

03:54.203 --> 03:55.936
Then everyone who dies screaming,

03:56.039 --> 03:58.918
who watches their loved ones
crushed before them,

03:59.008 --> 04:01.275
will have you to thank,
Detective Bullock.

04:01.377 --> 04:03.978
Look...

04:04.080 --> 04:06.781
nobody has to die.

04:06.883 --> 04:07.782
Well,

04:07.884 --> 04:10.384
except for these people.

04:10.486 --> 04:12.453
I know seeing is believing,

04:12.555 --> 04:15.923
and I do want you to believe me, so...

04:16.024 --> 04:18.759
(bystanders screaming)

04:18.861 --> 04:21.161
Oh, my God!

04:21.264 --> 04:24.331
Get officers on the scene now! Go!

04:26.602 --> 04:29.961
Six hours, Detective.

04:30.840 --> 04:33.474
The clock is ticking.

04:44.554 --> 04:47.188
Shame. I liked the clock tower.

04:47.290 --> 04:49.539
Jim took me there on a date once.

04:49.578 --> 04:52.126
Now they're both up in smoke.

04:52.228 --> 04:53.828
Good riddance.

04:53.930 --> 04:55.429
He always did want to die a hero.

04:55.524 --> 04:57.888
OSWALD: And that was Jim's problem.

04:59.936 --> 05:02.403
Me? I'd rather live.

05:03.906 --> 05:05.339
- And live well.
- Hmm.

05:05.441 --> 05:07.274
If it isn't little Penguin.

05:07.376 --> 05:09.034
Oh, and Butch's corpse.

05:09.097 --> 05:11.011
Hey, Tabby.

05:11.114 --> 05:12.580
Butch.

05:13.300 --> 05:16.617
The man responsible
for the recent fireworks

05:16.719 --> 05:18.886
is Jeremiah Valeska.

05:18.988 --> 05:20.749
Twin brother of our old associate.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.624
He has plans for Gotham.

05:23.726 --> 05:25.126
Plans we learned about

05:25.228 --> 05:27.194
courtesy of this gentleman.

05:27.296 --> 05:29.730
They ripped out my fingernails.

05:29.832 --> 05:31.871
I believe that this
is a golden opportunity

05:31.964 --> 05:33.067
for cash and glory.

05:33.169 --> 05:34.735
Normally, I would keep

05:34.837 --> 05:36.637
both of them for myself.

05:36.739 --> 05:39.397
But I find myself a bit short

05:39.491 --> 05:41.991
of the necessary manpower.

05:42.115 --> 05:45.662
- Or womanpower, if you will.
- Hmm.

05:45.748 --> 05:48.215
I'll go fifty-fifty on the take.

05:48.317 --> 05:50.351
An alliance with you?

05:50.453 --> 05:52.253
I'll pass.

05:52.355 --> 05:53.821
Pity. With the money

05:53.923 --> 05:55.990
we were gonna make,
I'd hoped to finally be able

05:56.092 --> 05:57.658
to cure Butch of his condition.

06:00.596 --> 06:02.363
Wait, what do you mean?

06:02.465 --> 06:05.266
Hugo Strange ran Indian Hill.

06:05.368 --> 06:08.676
Indian Hill's toxic sludge
turned Butch into this.

06:08.754 --> 06:11.172
Hugo Strange can fix Butch.

06:11.274 --> 06:12.907
But it won't be cheap.

06:13.434 --> 06:16.010
Strange might be my only hope, Tabby.

06:21.284 --> 06:22.616
Don't look at me like that.

06:22.718 --> 06:24.218
I almost got killed

06:24.320 --> 06:26.353
fighting your ex-boyfriend's
rotting corpse.

06:26.455 --> 06:28.255
I think it's time to return the favor.

06:28.685 --> 06:31.258
Fine. But Swamp Boy keeps his funk

06:31.360 --> 06:33.646
ten feet from me at all times.

06:34.397 --> 06:36.363
What did you have in mind?

06:41.233 --> 06:43.537
Evacuate the city in six hours?

06:43.639 --> 06:45.606
Five and a half hours.
And it will happen,

06:45.708 --> 06:48.742
because this maniac has bombs
hidden all over Gotham.

06:48.845 --> 06:50.444
Think of how many lives are at stake.

06:50.546 --> 06:52.413
And every minute you hesitate

06:52.515 --> 06:54.215
means fewer people get to safety.

06:54.317 --> 06:55.916
We'll need police.

06:56.018 --> 06:57.585
We are police! We're here to help.

06:57.687 --> 07:00.287
Harper, please, will you help the mayor?

07:00.389 --> 07:01.789
HARPER: You got it.

07:01.891 --> 07:03.157
BULLOCK: Holy mother of God.

07:03.259 --> 07:04.892
Bruce Wayne.

07:04.994 --> 07:07.795
Hey. Bruce.

07:07.897 --> 07:10.064
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

07:10.166 --> 07:12.900
I heard about Jim. Is it true?

07:13.002 --> 07:15.169
As far as I'm concerned,
Jim Gordon is alive, kicking,

07:15.271 --> 07:16.904
- and waiting for us to find him.
- Detective.

07:17.814 --> 07:19.740
Don't lie to me.

07:19.842 --> 07:21.642
It's not looking good, kid.

07:22.392 --> 07:25.179
I was hoping you could help me.
Did you see Jim?

07:25.281 --> 07:26.647
How did you get out of the bunker?

07:26.749 --> 07:28.148
Jeremiah and I
had already left the bunker.

07:28.251 --> 07:30.284
Jerome... Jerome sprayed him with a gas

07:30.386 --> 07:32.620
- that drove him insane.
- I'm so sick of that freaking family.

07:32.722 --> 07:34.612
Did you hear about Gotham Clock Tower?

07:34.690 --> 07:37.625
Huh? This guy's got
these massive explosives...

07:37.694 --> 07:39.927
- It's my fault.
- What?

07:40.250 --> 07:41.962
Jeremiah had plans

07:42.064 --> 07:44.665
to create next-generation generators.

07:45.313 --> 07:46.667
I funded him.

07:47.299 --> 07:50.237
Wayne Enterprises built those bombs?!

07:53.142 --> 07:54.975
(exhales)

07:55.077 --> 07:57.678
Listen, the-the schematics
for the batteries

07:57.780 --> 07:59.815
should be in the Wayne
Enterprises R&D lab.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.212
Lucius could take a look at them,

08:01.245 --> 08:02.377
figure out how to disarm the bombs.

08:02.447 --> 08:03.455
- I'm-I'm gonna go get them now.
- No, no, no, no, no.

08:03.526 --> 08:05.319
- You're going home.
- No, I have to do...

08:05.421 --> 08:06.520
Look, I know you feel guilty.

08:06.622 --> 08:09.602
But Jim Gordon was... is... important

08:09.664 --> 08:10.791
to all of us.

08:10.893 --> 08:12.641
And it's my job, so go home.

08:12.704 --> 08:14.194
Be with Alfred. Be safe.

08:14.297 --> 08:15.696
It's what Jim would want.

08:15.798 --> 08:19.300
- Lucius!
- (sighs)

08:19.402 --> 08:21.902
(phone ringing)

08:26.275 --> 08:27.975
Alfred, where have you been?

08:28.077 --> 08:30.210
JEREMIAH: <i>No, not Alfred.</i>

08:30.313 --> 08:33.111
I hope you didn't catch a cold
in my brother's grave.

08:33.190 --> 08:36.317
I know those things aren't
exactly designed for the living.

08:36.419 --> 08:37.650
What have you done?

08:37.753 --> 08:39.053
Where's Alfred?!

08:40.423 --> 08:42.655
Such anger.

08:42.758 --> 08:46.060
Some people... not me, of course...

08:46.162 --> 08:47.428
might consider that ingratitude,

08:47.530 --> 08:49.229
considering all I've done for you,

08:49.303 --> 08:51.046
<i>all I'm still doing for you.</i>

08:51.133 --> 08:52.666
You mean lying to me?

08:52.768 --> 08:54.168
Using my company to build bombs?

08:54.270 --> 08:55.502
Trying to kill me?

08:55.604 --> 08:58.339
Bruce, let's get something straight.

08:58.433 --> 09:00.833
If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

09:00.943 --> 09:02.776
I'd have put a bullet through your brain

09:02.878 --> 09:05.012
and left you to rot in that grave.

09:05.114 --> 09:08.248
But I meant what I said.

09:08.351 --> 09:10.250
You're my best friend,

09:10.353 --> 09:12.453
and today I'm gonna prove it to you.

09:12.555 --> 09:14.621
You are insane.

09:14.724 --> 09:16.623
You killed Jim Gordon.

09:16.726 --> 09:19.293
<i>And if you don't want
your manservant to die, too,</i>

09:19.403 --> 09:21.703
<i>you will follow my instructions
to the letter.</i>

09:21.797 --> 09:23.430
71 Welling Avenue.

09:23.532 --> 09:26.266
Be there in an hour.
Tell the police and I'll know.

that's where you are right now.

10:32.700 --> 10:33.999
Ed had you followed.

10:34.094 --> 10:36.161
His people found you after the blast.

10:36.263 --> 10:38.597
I'll have to thank him
when I arrest him.

10:44.471 --> 10:46.772
I'm surprised he didn't kill me.

10:50.043 --> 10:51.743
I am, too, actually.

10:52.622 --> 10:54.713
What do you plan to do with me?

10:54.815 --> 10:56.348
I don't really know.

10:56.450 --> 10:57.349
Lee,

10:57.451 --> 10:59.351
I have to get back to the GCPD.

10:59.453 --> 11:01.286
Jerome's brother Jeremiah...

11:01.388 --> 11:03.588
Blew up the Gotham Clock Tower
about an hour ago.

11:04.413 --> 11:06.358
The city's being evacuated.

11:06.460 --> 11:09.261
I have to... (grunts)

11:09.363 --> 11:11.459
It's just a painkiller.

11:13.133 --> 11:15.066
It does make you easier to handle.

11:15.169 --> 11:17.836
You're not going anywhere.

11:19.739 --> 11:22.073
My jacket. In my jacket...

11:28.315 --> 11:30.882
I got those from Jeremiah's office.

11:30.984 --> 11:34.119
They may give us some clue
as to what he's planning.

11:37.224 --> 11:39.758
- Please, let me take them to Harvey.
- Oh, Jim,

11:39.860 --> 11:42.327
you still think that you're the
only one who can save the city.

11:42.429 --> 11:44.095
Wait.

11:44.198 --> 11:45.463
Get some rest.

11:45.566 --> 11:48.466
Doctor's orders.

11:48.569 --> 11:51.837
(door locks)

11:55.509 --> 11:57.642
Jeremiah's followers
must have taken Alfred

11:57.744 --> 11:59.144
while I was at the cemetery.

11:59.246 --> 12:00.879
I bet he put up a fight.

12:02.182 --> 12:04.182
Thanks again for meeting me, Selina.

12:04.284 --> 12:06.184
- Sure.
- I didn't have anyone else to call.

12:06.270 --> 12:08.367
I know it's asking a lot, so
I just really appreciate...

12:08.446 --> 12:12.466
Bruce, I'm gonna be here
whenever you need me.

12:15.095 --> 12:17.419
Okay, that's the address.

12:18.489 --> 12:20.338
I don't see anyone, though.

12:20.434 --> 12:21.666
That could be a trap, right?

12:21.768 --> 12:23.705
I don't know.

12:24.924 --> 12:26.945
Jeremiah could've killed me
at the cemetery.

12:27.040 --> 12:28.506
He wants something out of me.

12:28.609 --> 12:30.675
Like what, to be your best friend?

12:30.777 --> 12:33.864
Trap or not, if Alfred's
in there, I need to find out.

12:47.895 --> 12:50.262
(soft creaking)

12:59.306 --> 13:01.706
Alfred?!

13:02.910 --> 13:04.209
(screams)

13:04.311 --> 13:05.343
Alfred!

13:05.445 --> 13:07.312
Alfred.

13:07.414 --> 13:09.514
(shouts)

13:09.616 --> 13:12.584
- (blows landing)
- (grunting)

13:12.686 --> 13:14.819
(cackling)

13:14.922 --> 13:17.522
(grunting)

13:17.624 --> 13:19.491
- Alfred!
- (shouting)

13:19.552 --> 13:21.664
You want to help Jim Gordon?

13:21.742 --> 13:22.883
Have you lost your mind?

13:22.954 --> 13:24.412
You brought him here because you thought

13:24.514 --> 13:26.422
it would give us leverage with the GCPD.

13:26.492 --> 13:28.650
Yes. By holding him hostage.

13:28.752 --> 13:31.386
This drawing is the key
to Valeska's plan.

13:31.488 --> 13:35.023
We solve it and we trade
the information for clemency.

13:35.125 --> 13:36.658
Perhaps.

13:36.760 --> 13:38.326
Or...

13:38.428 --> 13:42.864
perhaps there's something more going on.

13:42.966 --> 13:46.067
(sighs)

13:46.169 --> 13:50.004
What happened between Jim and I is over.

13:51.227 --> 13:53.975
I'm trying to protect what we've built.

13:57.274 --> 13:59.547
- I still like my plan better.
- Ed, if this maniac

13:59.649 --> 14:02.450
levels half the city, it's
gonna disrupt food distribution,

14:02.552 --> 14:04.041
water supply, power.

14:04.143 --> 14:06.387
The people of the Narrows
will suffer the most.

14:06.489 --> 14:08.756
We can prevent that,
while, at the same time,

14:08.858 --> 14:11.759
helping us out of this mess we're in.

14:14.230 --> 14:16.497
Please.

14:18.182 --> 14:20.368
Fine.

14:20.470 --> 14:21.869
(sighs)

14:21.972 --> 14:24.439
If this is what you want,

14:25.561 --> 14:27.909
I will do it.

14:28.210 --> 14:30.011
For you.

14:31.772 --> 14:33.314
Do it for us.

14:44.327 --> 14:46.239
REPORTER: <i>After the mayor's
evacuation orders,</i>

14:46.317 --> 14:48.396
<i>the New Trigate Bridge
is absolute bedlam...</i>

14:48.498 --> 14:49.797
Where we at with the evac?

14:49.899 --> 14:51.232
Bridges and tunnels
are bumper-to-bumper.

14:51.334 --> 14:52.967
National Guard is bringing
in the choppers.

14:53.069 --> 14:54.635
But we're talking about
evacuating hospitals,

14:54.738 --> 14:56.104
nursing homes, jails.

14:56.206 --> 14:57.572
Some people just don't want to leave.

14:57.674 --> 14:59.350
<i>We're seeing the same level</i>

14:59.428 --> 15:00.733
<i>of panic on every bridge and tunnel...</i>

15:00.844 --> 15:02.944
God, what a mess. Just make it happen.

15:03.046 --> 15:04.746
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

15:04.848 --> 15:05.980
All right, let's control this...

15:06.082 --> 15:08.616
I got the schematics
from Wayne Enterprises R&D.

15:08.718 --> 15:10.898
The Wayne kid said
the bombs were batteries.

15:10.984 --> 15:13.539
A series of networked
self-perpetuating generators.

15:13.632 --> 15:14.956
But when supercharged,

15:15.058 --> 15:17.091
they contain enough energy
to level a city block.

15:17.193 --> 15:18.760
Got it. Battery bombs from hell.

15:18.862 --> 15:21.329
Just tell me this will help us
find and disable them.

15:21.431 --> 15:24.532
Disable, yes. Find, no. But...

15:26.293 --> 15:28.360
...look, look here.

15:28.385 --> 15:30.901
Because they were created
to be networked together,

15:30.965 --> 15:32.373
Jeremiah would have to send the signal

15:32.475 --> 15:34.275
a centrally located core relay in order

15:34.379 --> 15:36.004
to blow all the bombs
from a single detonator.

15:36.066 --> 15:37.845
Lucius, just English, please.

15:37.947 --> 15:40.820
Sorry. The bombs are connected
by a nervous system.

15:40.913 --> 15:42.406
The core relay is the brain.

15:42.507 --> 15:43.684
We find that, we destroy that...

15:43.787 --> 15:45.319
We can stop the bombs from going off.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.455
- Yes.
- But how do we find it?

15:47.557 --> 15:48.623
How do we find this...

15:48.725 --> 15:50.992
brain?

15:51.094 --> 15:53.394
(horns honking in distance)

15:58.301 --> 16:01.335
Oh, Bruce.

16:01.438 --> 16:05.039
You are about to have a very
transformative experience.

16:07.277 --> 16:09.709
I envy you.

16:15.418 --> 16:17.318
Call our friend.

16:17.420 --> 16:19.241
Tell him to kill the butler.

16:19.319 --> 16:21.389
He's no longer necessary.

16:25.829 --> 16:28.930
Oswald Cobblepot.

16:29.032 --> 16:31.265
Barbara Kean.

16:31.367 --> 16:34.102
In my stronghold.

16:34.204 --> 16:38.372
Not one step closer, Mr. Valeska.

16:39.021 --> 16:42.351
And is that my dear Jongleur
with my core relay in his hand

16:42.461 --> 16:44.212
and a grenade taped to his mouth?

16:44.867 --> 16:46.948
Indeed, it is.

16:47.057 --> 16:50.291
Huh. Well,

16:51.187 --> 16:53.254
it seems you have the upper hand.

16:53.356 --> 16:55.256
Undoubtedly.

16:55.358 --> 16:56.991
And now...

16:58.795 --> 17:01.665
...we have our own demands.

17:09.728 --> 17:11.675
$50 million.

17:11.771 --> 17:13.604
That's what you want.

17:13.981 --> 17:16.406
It's a nice round number.

17:16.471 --> 17:18.805
I don't quite have that on me right now.

17:18.839 --> 17:22.108
You gave the mayor six
hours to evacuate Gotham.

17:22.868 --> 17:24.711
An impossible task.

17:24.775 --> 17:26.252
Let him buy another hour.

17:26.329 --> 17:28.376
He will save thousands of lives.

17:28.454 --> 17:30.841
$50 million will seem cheap.

17:30.903 --> 17:31.950
I see.

17:31.998 --> 17:35.466
I play the villain,
you get away scot-free and rich.

17:36.192 --> 17:37.879
I get you the money,

17:38.067 --> 17:39.747
you give me back my core relay.

17:39.841 --> 17:43.391
That is usually how
a handoff works. Yeah.

17:46.022 --> 17:48.489
You drive a hard bargain,
but I'll see what I can do.

17:48.672 --> 17:50.414
BARBARA: Just like that?

17:50.539 --> 17:53.551
After knowing your brother,
I expected something more...

17:53.586 --> 17:54.852
Insane?

17:54.878 --> 17:58.980
I'm nothing if not sane. And reasonable.

17:59.037 --> 18:01.759
Two things my brother never valued.

18:01.794 --> 18:04.318
Which is why I'll be successful
where he failed.

18:04.387 --> 18:07.506
Well, that and being...

18:07.700 --> 18:10.234
vastly more intelligent.

18:12.038 --> 18:14.578
Now, to see about your money.

18:14.941 --> 18:16.173
(line ringing)

18:16.209 --> 18:18.484
This is Jeremiah Valeska.

18:18.784 --> 18:19.883
I'd like to speak to the mayor.

18:19.937 --> 18:21.679
I have additional demands.

18:21.714 --> 18:23.712
Yes, really.

18:24.696 --> 18:26.562
$50 million,

18:26.634 --> 18:29.095
unmarked bills.
I'll tell you the location.

18:29.150 --> 18:30.454
We're not just
gonna hand this thing over

18:30.490 --> 18:32.223
and let him destroy Gotham, are we?

18:32.258 --> 18:34.492
Of course not. Once we get the money,

18:34.538 --> 18:35.793
we kill Jeremiah and his people,

18:35.828 --> 18:37.628
give the core relay to the police,

18:37.663 --> 18:38.963
split the $50 million,

18:38.998 --> 18:41.732
and are hailed as the heroes of Gotham.

18:42.602 --> 18:44.602
And we cure Butch.

18:45.578 --> 18:47.304
And that. Certainly.

18:47.340 --> 18:48.572
JEREMIAH: Would you believe it?

18:49.750 --> 18:51.642
They put me on hold.

18:53.146 --> 18:54.378
Well,

18:54.414 --> 18:56.580
there's always plan number two.

18:56.616 --> 18:58.215
- Get down!
- Wait!

19:03.656 --> 19:05.556
(shouting, gasping)

19:09.796 --> 19:11.328
(coughing)

19:11.364 --> 19:14.298
Are you out of your mind?!

19:14.333 --> 19:16.467
Why do you keep insisting I'm insane?

19:16.502 --> 19:19.136
What's insane about
having a backup plan?

19:19.172 --> 19:22.973
Something Jongleur never knew about.

19:23.009 --> 19:26.610
And, so you know, this building
is within the blast radius.

19:26.646 --> 19:28.012
And because of your interference,

19:28.047 --> 19:29.280
I'm gonna detonate the bombs as soon

19:29.315 --> 19:32.082
as I'm far enough away to observe
the destruction in peace.

19:32.118 --> 19:35.085
BARBARA: No!
You promised the city six hours!

19:35.121 --> 19:37.321
And whose fault is it
that I changed my mind?

19:38.893 --> 19:41.283
Tell our men to rewire the bombs
to work in direct sequence.

19:41.340 --> 19:43.140
And, the rest of you,

19:43.863 --> 19:45.429
kill these idiots.

19:51.571 --> 19:53.170
Alfred!

19:53.525 --> 19:55.606
JEREMIAH: <i>Hello, Bruce.</i>

19:56.040 --> 19:57.541
Jeremiah!

19:57.577 --> 19:58.976
<i>I imagine you're wondering,</i>

19:59.011 --> 20:01.846
<i>why is Jeremiah doing this?</i>

20:01.891 --> 20:04.692
<i>My brother once said,
"All it takes is one bad day</i>

20:04.717 --> 20:08.486
<i>to reduce the sanest man alive
to lunacy."</i>

20:08.521 --> 20:10.120
(Alfred screaming)

20:10.886 --> 20:14.104
<i>Jerome gave me what I thought
was the worst day of my life.</i>

20:14.175 --> 20:18.034
<i>But only by losing everything
was I able to face</i>

20:18.059 --> 20:19.196
<i>what was inside me.</i>

20:19.232 --> 20:22.199
<i>And I believe I've seen
something very special</i>

20:22.235 --> 20:24.889
<i>- inside of you as well.</i>
- Alfred.

20:25.004 --> 20:28.005
<i>But to free it, you'll have to lose</i>

20:28.040 --> 20:32.107
<i>everything and everyone you hold dear.</i>

20:35.548 --> 20:37.515
(raspy breathing)

20:39.919 --> 20:43.420
<i>I instructed Scarecrow to mix up
something exceptional.</i>

20:43.456 --> 20:44.846
No!

20:47.260 --> 20:51.051
<i>Your butler is going to
show you the path ahead.</i>

20:56.259 --> 20:57.458
(cackling)

20:57.483 --> 21:00.752
<i>Now watch closely.</i>

21:02.408 --> 21:03.674
(Alfred screaming)

21:05.662 --> 21:07.569
BRUCE: No. No!

21:07.647 --> 21:09.562
Alfred!

21:13.781 --> 21:15.554
Hello, sleepyhead.

21:15.593 --> 21:17.721
You do realize the city
is about to be blown up?

21:17.757 --> 21:19.557
It's an odd time for a nap.

21:19.592 --> 21:21.179
You know that she drugged me.

21:21.227 --> 21:22.693
Yeah. Don't really care.

21:22.728 --> 21:24.354
Thank you, gentlemen.

21:25.268 --> 21:28.599
I want to make one thing very clear.

21:28.634 --> 21:32.612
If Gotham becomes a rock pile,
I mind zero percent.

21:32.651 --> 21:34.403
I'm only helping you

21:34.574 --> 21:36.473
because I'm with Lee now.

21:36.509 --> 21:38.576
Fine. Whatever.

21:38.618 --> 21:41.412
Feign nonchalance. It's very cute.

21:41.447 --> 21:43.247
It's almost convincing.

21:43.282 --> 21:45.145
Ed, Jeremiah Valeska is threatening

21:45.170 --> 21:46.450
to destroy half the city.

21:46.485 --> 21:48.552
You really think I care
if you've deluded yourself

21:48.588 --> 21:50.254
into thinking you and Lee are a couple?

21:51.022 --> 21:52.590
You see...

21:52.866 --> 21:54.625
that is my point.

21:54.660 --> 21:57.227
You don't believe that Lee
could actually love me, do you?

21:57.263 --> 21:59.630
Honestly? No.

21:59.665 --> 22:02.633
- Hmm.
- You're a psychopath and a murderer.

22:02.668 --> 22:04.068
And the fact that you need me

22:04.103 --> 22:06.737
to validate your crazy fantasy

22:06.772 --> 22:08.339
means that you don't believe it either.

22:08.374 --> 22:10.474
That doesn't matter. What matters

22:10.509 --> 22:12.142
is stopping Jeremiah
from killing thousands

22:12.178 --> 22:13.644
of people, so can we...?

22:14.438 --> 22:15.446
Yeah.

22:15.481 --> 22:16.947
- We're gonna settle this.
- Ed.

22:16.983 --> 22:18.015
No, Jim.

22:18.050 --> 22:19.650
This isn't the GCPD.

22:19.685 --> 22:22.319
Here, I make the rules,
so we're not gonna do this

22:22.355 --> 22:23.954
until we talk about
what I want to talk about.

22:23.990 --> 22:26.790
Lee's changed. I accept that.

22:26.826 --> 22:29.259
Maybe she will never be
the person that I knew.

22:29.295 --> 22:32.496
Fine. But she is not
who you think she is.

22:32.531 --> 22:33.497
(scoffs)

22:33.532 --> 22:34.932
The fact that she's with you

22:34.967 --> 22:36.433
in whatever way she's with you...

22:36.469 --> 22:37.868
Oh, Jim.

22:39.038 --> 22:40.871
She's with me in every way.

22:42.975 --> 22:46.644
...means that she wants
something from you.

22:47.644 --> 22:50.511
So when it's done,
she'll get rid of you.

22:53.319 --> 22:55.386
So you're saying that she
wouldn't be with a killer?

22:55.421 --> 22:58.271
And yet... she was with you.

22:58.787 --> 23:03.661
And you, Jim, are ten times
the killer that I ever was.

23:05.398 --> 23:07.419
You have a point.

23:09.068 --> 23:11.702
Maybe that's why she's not with me now.

23:12.938 --> 23:15.205
Can we do this?

23:17.209 --> 23:18.409
Why not?

23:18.444 --> 23:21.378
Just try to keep up. I'll speak slowly.

23:21.414 --> 23:22.646
So, most labyrinths

23:22.682 --> 23:25.015
are constructed as contiguous lines

23:25.051 --> 23:26.848
along concentric circles.

23:26.926 --> 23:30.320
One way in, one way out.
But this one's different.

23:30.356 --> 23:31.755
Undoubtedly.

23:31.791 --> 23:34.324
Those red rectangles...

23:34.360 --> 23:36.493
they're unbound on one side.

23:36.529 --> 23:38.328
And they overlap black lines

23:38.364 --> 23:39.997
which would lead out of the labyrinth.

23:40.032 --> 23:42.674
So maybe we're not looking at plans...

23:44.041 --> 23:45.689
but the end result.

23:46.134 --> 23:47.337
Voilá.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.640
Look familiar?

23:56.615 --> 23:58.682
GORDON: So this...

23:59.692 --> 24:01.285
is Wayne Enterprises.

24:01.320 --> 24:03.754
This would be Gotham Central Bank.

24:04.379 --> 24:06.390
These are the buildings
Jeremiah's planning

24:06.425 --> 24:08.292
to demolish with his bombs.

24:08.327 --> 24:10.260
Once those buildings are blown,

24:10.306 --> 24:11.572
they collapse and create the labyrinth

24:11.597 --> 24:12.963
from the finished drawing.

24:12.998 --> 24:15.699
Jeremiah lived
his entire life in a maze.

24:15.735 --> 24:17.201
Now he's trying to remake the city

24:17.236 --> 24:18.802
into the place he feels most safe.

24:18.838 --> 24:20.804
It's actually rather elegant.

24:20.840 --> 24:22.606
I need to get to the GCPD.

24:22.641 --> 24:24.074
(scoffs): Yeah, no, sorry.

24:24.110 --> 24:25.476
You're not going anywhere until we get

24:25.511 --> 24:26.610
this information to the mayor.

24:26.645 --> 24:28.445
Lee and I have some

24:28.481 --> 24:30.581
legal knots we need untangled.

24:30.616 --> 24:34.384
Yeah. Before we spend the rest
of our lives together.

24:34.420 --> 24:36.419
So you're gonna use this
to hold the city hostage?

24:36.444 --> 24:37.588
Time is running out.

24:37.623 --> 24:38.889
Well, then the mayor would be wise

24:38.924 --> 24:41.119
to forgive Lee and I our indiscretions.

24:41.961 --> 24:43.927
Ed, wait.

24:43.963 --> 24:46.296
There's one thing I can't figure out.

24:47.244 --> 24:48.732
One?

24:48.768 --> 24:50.067
You're being a little kind to yourself.

24:50.102 --> 24:51.635
Yeah. I'm sorry.

24:51.670 --> 24:53.971
I think you made a mistake.

24:54.006 --> 24:55.139
Where?

24:55.174 --> 24:56.640
(grunts)

25:05.556 --> 25:07.522
Get the core relay, he says.

25:07.853 --> 25:10.119
Have the upper hand, he says.

25:10.147 --> 25:11.646
(yelling)

25:16.286 --> 25:17.786
Finally.

25:17.821 --> 25:19.187
Let's get the hell out of here

25:19.223 --> 25:21.523
before Jeremiah blows us all
to smithereens.

25:21.558 --> 25:23.792
Ah, this is all your fault, Oswald.

25:23.827 --> 25:25.994
- You'd better...
- Fix it. I know.

25:26.029 --> 25:28.029
(panting)

25:28.065 --> 25:30.098
(phone rings)

25:30.154 --> 25:31.975
- What?
- OSWALD: <i>Harvey.</i>

25:32.000 --> 25:35.134
Is this Oswald?

25:35.180 --> 25:36.679
I'm, uh, kind of busy.

25:36.715 --> 25:38.161
I have information regarding

25:38.215 --> 25:39.622
- Jeremiah Valeska's plan.
- (groans)

25:39.684 --> 25:41.484
- <i>What information?</i>
- Ah.

25:41.520 --> 25:42.785
Wait a second. Is that gunfire?

25:42.821 --> 25:44.053
<i>Just listen.</i>

25:44.089 --> 25:46.055
Jeremiah is not honoring the six hours.

25:46.091 --> 25:47.400
He will blow the bombs

25:47.425 --> 25:48.892
<i>as soon as he can watch the catastrophe</i>

25:48.927 --> 25:50.793
<i>from a safe distance.</i>

25:50.829 --> 25:52.795
Jeremiah said something
about rewiring the bombs

25:52.831 --> 25:53.963
<i>to communicate with each other.</i>

25:53.999 --> 25:55.899
<i>He called it a direct sequence.</i>

25:55.934 --> 25:57.734
Communicate with each other.

25:57.769 --> 25:59.432
<i>Harvey.</i>

26:00.038 --> 26:01.704
Harvey!

26:01.740 --> 26:04.797
It's a backup system from when
they operated as batteries.

26:04.822 --> 26:06.409
That means we can disrupt them

26:06.444 --> 26:08.378
by disarming the first bomb
in the sequence.

26:08.413 --> 26:09.679
It's like removing one light

26:09.722 --> 26:11.099
from a string of Christmas lights.

26:11.154 --> 26:12.582
If only we knew where the bombs were.

26:12.617 --> 26:14.117
- (door closes)
- MAN: He's back. Hey.

26:14.152 --> 26:16.352
(officers exclaiming)

26:16.388 --> 26:18.588
Jim! Oh.

26:18.623 --> 26:20.096
Oh, buddy.

26:20.135 --> 26:21.658
Oh.

26:21.693 --> 26:23.110
All right, easy there, big fella.

26:23.135 --> 26:24.427
Remember, I just got blown up.

26:24.462 --> 26:25.776
How'd you get out of the bunker?

26:25.823 --> 26:28.957
It's a long story. But what matters is,

26:29.019 --> 26:32.201
I have the locations of every
bomb Jeremiah planted.

26:39.193 --> 26:41.073
BRUCE: Alfred.

26:41.756 --> 26:44.090
(indistinct chatter and laughter)

26:44.115 --> 26:45.909
Alfred.

26:52.206 --> 26:54.057
Alfred.

26:56.361 --> 26:59.195
(both laugh)

27:00.745 --> 27:02.525
Alfred.

27:04.947 --> 27:09.470
Jeremiah said Bruce Wayne might
try to bring his friends.

27:10.962 --> 27:12.963
I suppose you're one of them.

27:13.064 --> 27:15.463
What? No. I just wandered in here.

27:15.525 --> 27:17.647
I think our little experiment

27:17.682 --> 27:20.483
is about to get much more interesting.

27:23.435 --> 27:25.161
Jeremiah wasn't bluffing.

27:25.186 --> 27:27.090
There's at least
a dozen bombs on this map.

27:27.125 --> 27:29.559
But you're saying if we disarm
one of them in the sequence,

27:29.594 --> 27:31.169
we'll stop all of them from going off.

27:31.255 --> 27:33.710
And according to this,
the closest one is just a mile away.

27:33.735 --> 27:34.998
I need to look at the schematics

27:35.033 --> 27:36.399
to determine the best
way to neutralize them.

27:36.434 --> 27:38.968
Alert the bomb squad.
Tell 'em to meet me there.

27:39.004 --> 27:40.484
Wait. Harvey.

27:40.554 --> 27:42.639
Let the bomb squad handle this.
You don't have to go.

27:42.674 --> 27:45.742
Yes, I do. I need this, Jim.

27:46.495 --> 27:48.128
Yeah.

27:50.348 --> 27:53.583
(grunting)

27:55.453 --> 27:56.854
- (bones crunch)
- (screams)

27:56.888 --> 28:00.023
(screaming)

28:09.134 --> 28:11.401
(Selina screams)

28:14.806 --> 28:16.706
It doesn't matter.

28:16.741 --> 28:18.341
The experiment is nearing

28:18.376 --> 28:19.842
its conclusion.

28:19.878 --> 28:22.845
Your friend will soon be driven mad.

28:28.386 --> 28:30.353
(rock music playing)

28:37.762 --> 28:39.162
(screams)

28:39.197 --> 28:41.097
(Bruce screaming)

28:43.702 --> 28:44.934
Stop!

28:46.504 --> 28:48.037
(screaming)

28:53.745 --> 28:55.078
No!

28:55.113 --> 28:57.346
(screaming)

28:59.718 --> 29:01.084
(Alfred laughing)

29:01.119 --> 29:02.218
BRUCE: Alfred.

29:02.253 --> 29:04.220
(laughing)

29:23.441 --> 29:25.408
(Alfred continues laughing)

29:40.593 --> 29:42.381
Alfred, please.

29:42.476 --> 29:44.109
Please stop.

29:44.191 --> 29:46.157
(laughing)

29:52.339 --> 29:54.370
Alfred.

29:55.120 --> 29:56.353
(both grunting)

29:56.412 --> 29:58.379
Alfred. Alfred, stop!

29:58.414 --> 30:00.614
- (laughs)
- Alfred!

30:03.152 --> 30:05.525
Just stop. Alfred. Please.

30:05.580 --> 30:07.260
- (yells)
- (screams)

30:11.160 --> 30:12.893
(Bruce screaming)

30:17.500 --> 30:19.466
(pounding on door, muffled grunting)

30:28.130 --> 30:29.861
What...?

30:30.346 --> 30:32.346
(grunting)

30:32.381 --> 30:35.082
- (groans)
- Oh, come on, Brucie.

30:35.257 --> 30:37.585
Give me a smile.

30:37.620 --> 30:39.620
- Smile.
- (grunts)

30:39.655 --> 30:41.702
Alfred, listen to me.

30:41.928 --> 30:44.425
You can beat this. You can fight this.

30:44.460 --> 30:46.327
(groans)

30:46.352 --> 30:48.429
Alfred, you're stronger than him.

30:48.464 --> 30:50.130
(laughs)

30:50.176 --> 30:51.542
(groans)

30:51.567 --> 30:53.300
Do not let him win!

30:53.336 --> 30:55.169
(laughing)

30:55.204 --> 30:56.303
(gunshot)

30:58.541 --> 31:02.676
No! No! Alfred!

31:02.712 --> 31:05.479
- Bruce. Bruce. Bruce. Bruce.
- Alfred! Alfred!

31:05.514 --> 31:07.047
Breathe. Look at me.

31:07.083 --> 31:09.650
Scarecrow was just pumping
his fear gas in here.

31:09.685 --> 31:12.119
You were only seeing
what he wanted you to.

31:17.149 --> 31:19.526
No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

31:19.562 --> 31:20.694
ALFRED: No, Bruce, Bruce, Bruce.

31:20.730 --> 31:22.630
Bruce, Bruce!

31:22.665 --> 31:24.465
Listen. Listen to me. Listen.

31:24.500 --> 31:26.700
Look at me, look.

31:27.337 --> 31:29.384
Just look at me.

31:31.360 --> 31:33.454
Look, I'm fine.

31:33.876 --> 31:35.626
It's me.

31:37.124 --> 31:39.166
It's Alfred.

31:45.054 --> 31:46.654
Alfred.

31:49.052 --> 31:50.991
Alfred.

31:51.019 --> 31:52.985
- (car horns honking)
- (indistinct shouting)

31:53.029 --> 31:55.663
(phone ringing)

31:55.698 --> 31:57.264
Hey.

31:57.299 --> 31:59.230
I'm at the site.
Where the hell's the bomb squad?

31:59.301 --> 32:01.702
The evacuation's jamming the
streets. They're still en route.

32:01.737 --> 32:04.371
I can't wait. I got to go in.

32:04.407 --> 32:06.340
Do you see the bomb?

32:07.051 --> 32:09.489
I don't know what it's supposed
to look like, but I think

32:09.544 --> 32:12.192
it is exactly what I'm staring at.

32:12.415 --> 32:15.849
Oh, Lucius, we got to do this thing.

32:15.885 --> 32:18.519
- Harvey...
- <i>Listen. We can't wait.</i>

32:18.554 --> 32:21.121
We don't know when Jeremiah's
gonna set this thing off.

32:22.591 --> 32:23.957
Then you're gonna have
to unscrew the antenna

32:23.993 --> 32:26.226
- to activate the kill switch.
- <i>Okay.</i>

32:26.262 --> 32:28.228
(panting)

32:33.436 --> 32:35.969
- (whirring)
- Ah, Lucius.

32:36.005 --> 32:37.866
<i>It's making some kind of weird noise.</i>

32:37.897 --> 32:39.073
What kind of a noise?

32:39.118 --> 32:41.485
A bad one, and-and it's-it's, uh,

32:41.510 --> 32:43.077
getting all glow-y.

32:43.112 --> 32:45.746
Then you are going to have
to work quickly.

32:46.281 --> 32:47.948
<i>Okay.</i>

32:51.654 --> 32:54.621
CULTISTS: Jeremiah! Jeremiah!

32:58.094 --> 32:59.893
- (beep)
- All my life,

32:59.929 --> 33:02.463
I spent by myself.

33:02.677 --> 33:05.002
Hidden away.

33:05.159 --> 33:09.295
I am so glad
to be sharing this happy moment

33:09.338 --> 33:11.472
with all of you.

33:11.507 --> 33:15.309
Today marks the dawning
of a new Gotham City.

33:15.344 --> 33:20.080
One where we will all be free.

33:22.653 --> 33:24.318
Now...

33:26.155 --> 33:28.122
...shall I do the honors?

33:28.870 --> 33:30.357
<i>Once you unscrew the antenna,</i>

33:30.596 --> 33:32.960
<i>a kill switch breaker should pop out.</i>

33:33.136 --> 33:35.195
<i>Destroying it should stop
the signal from the detonator</i>

33:35.231 --> 33:37.264
<i>to all the bombs.</i>

33:37.299 --> 33:39.666
(whirring)

33:42.289 --> 33:43.771
Which breaker is it?

33:43.806 --> 33:45.372
What?

33:45.407 --> 33:47.441
- What do you mean, which breaker?
- <i>There are two of 'em.</i>

33:47.476 --> 33:50.601
Jeremiah must've changed them since
making these schematics.

33:50.663 --> 33:53.714
- Okay. I'll break both of 'em.
- <i>No, wait, Harvey,</i>

33:53.749 --> 33:55.949
one of the breakers could be
the supercharge fail-safe.

33:55.985 --> 33:57.518
Whatever you do, do not touch that one.

33:57.553 --> 33:58.719
Or?

33:58.754 --> 34:00.521
Or all the bombs will blow.

34:01.278 --> 34:03.161
Lucius, they're identical.

34:03.215 --> 34:05.278
Then, Harvey, I don't know.

34:07.329 --> 34:08.562
MAN: <i>We interrupt this program...</i>

34:08.589 --> 34:10.898
- WOMAN: That's Jim Gordon!
- He's not dead.

34:11.483 --> 34:15.280
GORDON: <i>This is a message
to the followers of Jeremiah Valeska.</i>

34:15.445 --> 34:17.512
<i>Jeremiah claims to have killed me.</i>

34:17.540 --> 34:19.505
<i>Well, bad news,</i>

34:19.542 --> 34:21.308
<i>I'm alive.</i>

34:21.342 --> 34:22.576
(murmuring)

34:22.610 --> 34:24.878
No. No, no, it's a trick.

34:24.914 --> 34:27.214
- I killed him.
- <i>So, just know</i>

34:27.248 --> 34:29.516
<i>you're worshipping a fraud.</i>

34:29.552 --> 34:32.152
<i>A pale imitation of Jerome.</i>

34:32.188 --> 34:34.154
<i>You did your worst, Jeremiah,</i>

34:34.190 --> 34:36.523
<i>and I'm still here.</i>

34:38.253 --> 34:40.308
- You lied to us.
- Gordon's alive.

34:40.362 --> 34:41.824
What does it matter whether he's alive?

34:44.266 --> 34:45.998
When I hit this switch,

34:46.034 --> 34:49.402
we will hear the sounds
of a new world being born.

34:51.907 --> 34:54.541
(muttering)

34:55.143 --> 34:56.710
Our world.

34:58.473 --> 35:00.494
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

35:00.519 --> 35:02.883
Which of you will make it blow?

35:05.487 --> 35:06.824
Now,

35:07.043 --> 35:08.887
listen.

35:14.396 --> 35:16.363
(chuckles)

35:18.467 --> 35:19.766
(pants)

35:28.143 --> 35:30.310
- He's a liar!
- He's a fake!

35:30.346 --> 35:31.445
- Liar!
- (shouting)

35:31.480 --> 35:33.714
- Stop!
- (shouting stops)

35:39.188 --> 35:41.154
(chuckles quietly)

35:47.129 --> 35:50.928
I want you all to know

35:51.983 --> 35:56.139
I find your fickleness

35:56.305 --> 35:58.738
quite hurtful.

35:59.847 --> 36:01.608
And more so,

36:02.425 --> 36:04.411
very predictable.

36:07.983 --> 36:09.616
(shouting)

36:16.358 --> 36:19.593
(screaming)

36:20.222 --> 36:23.250
Well, that is disappointing.

36:30.975 --> 36:32.074
If you'd ask me this morning

36:32.148 --> 36:33.882
how many people I was gonna kill today,

36:33.945 --> 36:35.678
I would've been way off.

36:35.780 --> 36:39.085
Perhaps the outcome was
not what we had hoped,

36:39.148 --> 36:41.545
- but it was worth the risk.
- Ozzie,

36:41.647 --> 36:44.781
if I were you, I would limp out
of here while you still can.

36:44.883 --> 36:46.016
Fine.

36:46.118 --> 36:47.451
Let's go, Butch.

36:47.545 --> 36:48.695
Nope.

36:49.555 --> 36:50.620
I'm done.

36:50.723 --> 36:52.253
Ever since we teamed up,

36:52.316 --> 36:53.535
everything's gone to crap.

36:53.592 --> 36:55.392
Hell, we don't even
know where Strange is.

36:55.494 --> 36:59.129
Except I do know where Strange is.

36:59.982 --> 37:01.725
You mean to tell me
you've known where he is

37:01.779 --> 37:02.990
the whole time and haven't told me?!

37:03.068 --> 37:04.968
(strained): I just got word.

37:05.070 --> 37:06.303
No more excuses!

37:06.405 --> 37:08.528
He fixes me now!

37:08.590 --> 37:11.508
And how exactly do we pay him?

37:11.610 --> 37:14.611
I can be very persuasive.

37:18.658 --> 37:20.650
Think. Think.

37:20.751 --> 37:22.052
Think, think, think,
think, think, think.

37:22.154 --> 37:24.087
How did they beat you, huh?

37:24.165 --> 37:26.523
How did they figure you out?

37:26.665 --> 37:29.993
Hmm, Gordon must've stolen
the blueprints to the maze,

37:30.095 --> 37:32.996
found one of the bombs,
and sabotaged the sequence.

37:33.098 --> 37:34.831
Hmm.

37:34.933 --> 37:37.275
I'll have to start again.

37:39.104 --> 37:40.416
RA'S AL GHUL: You're tenacious.

37:40.586 --> 37:42.728
I like that.

37:43.509 --> 37:45.075
Who are you?

37:45.177 --> 37:47.277
What do you want?

37:47.379 --> 37:49.279
I had a vision.

37:49.381 --> 37:51.214
Of Gotham in flames.

37:52.147 --> 37:54.251
Together, we can make that happen.

37:54.353 --> 37:56.686
Well, I appreciate the offer,

37:56.789 --> 37:59.589
but recent events have convinced me

37:59.691 --> 38:02.292
of the benefits of working alone.

38:02.394 --> 38:05.128
Don't be so rash.

38:05.230 --> 38:08.061
Your dream of a new Gotham
will come to be.

38:08.142 --> 38:09.381
With my help.

38:12.504 --> 38:14.070
(sighs)

38:14.173 --> 38:17.040
You're behind me, aren't you?

38:19.853 --> 38:21.912
I can conquer Gotham on my own.

38:22.014 --> 38:23.580
What makes you think I need your help,

38:23.682 --> 38:26.216
whoever you are?

38:26.318 --> 38:28.118
Because, my boy,

38:28.220 --> 38:33.156
all this is not just about Gotham.

38:34.860 --> 38:38.662
This is about Bruce Wayne.

38:52.177 --> 38:54.744
You here to arrest me?

38:55.538 --> 38:57.147
To thank you.

38:57.811 --> 39:00.483
And to present you with an offer.

39:00.586 --> 39:02.803
Leave Gotham.

39:04.874 --> 39:06.356
Start a new life somewhere else.

39:06.458 --> 39:08.191
Alone.

39:08.293 --> 39:11.461
(sighs)

39:11.563 --> 39:13.530
And if I don't?

39:19.471 --> 39:22.225
I know we can't change the past.

39:23.412 --> 39:25.642
What we've done.

39:26.225 --> 39:28.313
Or done to each other.

39:30.415 --> 39:33.583
I can't pretend to recognize
the person I see before me.

39:38.290 --> 39:41.592
But whatever happens
after I walk out that door,

39:43.842 --> 39:46.062
I care about you.

39:46.560 --> 39:48.131
And I always will.

and a very hot shower.

Okay, lad.

42:09.524 --> 42:11.241
You're welcome.

42:18.283 --> 42:21.379
Why do you think he's

42:22.723 --> 42:24.954
Jeremiah said all it takes
is one bad day

42:25.057 --> 42:27.137
to drive a person insane.

42:31.961 --> 42:35.992
I wonder if my parents dying
made me a little insane.

42:38.578 --> 42:40.970
Maybe he sensed that.

42:42.007 --> 42:44.466
Maybe he wanted to bring it out.

42:45.380 --> 42:47.577
Well, you proved him wrong.

42:48.827 --> 42:51.261
JEREMIAH: To be fair...
