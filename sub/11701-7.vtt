00:00.364 --> 00:02.284
You ever asked Toni who
got her back onto the drugs?

00:03.124 --> 00:04.964
I always thought Francesca
had a cruel streak,

00:05.044 --> 00:06.484
but to do that to one of her own...

00:06.804 --> 00:08.484
She knew what would happen to Kaiya.

00:09.004 --> 00:10.564
She promised me she'd never do that.

00:11.124 --> 00:13.004
We both know that it wasn't Franky.

00:13.604 --> 00:15.924
You're charged with supplying
illicit drugs to another prisoner.

00:16.404 --> 00:18.644
Put her back in the slot
for an extended stay.

00:19.404 --> 00:20.564
I love you.

00:22.964 --> 00:24.444
I want to be your wife.

00:24.884 --> 00:26.484
- Who's Adam?
- Her boyfriend.

00:27.004 --> 00:30.284
I don't know what Vera's told
you, but she's never had one.

02:46.124 --> 02:47.764
You're not supposed to use your hand.

02:47.884 --> 02:49.404
I can't do it with my legs.

02:55.204 --> 02:57.204
- Oh!
- Sorry.

03:09.684 --> 03:10.844
What's his problem?

03:14.444 --> 03:15.604
Mr. Jackson.

03:15.684 --> 03:17.164
What are we meant to play with now?

03:27.724 --> 03:30.484
Hey. Hey. Grow up.

03:36.764 --> 03:40.404
Kim. What did I say about
speaking before you're spoken to?

03:43.004 --> 03:45.164
- Now go and get your toy.
- I'll get it.

03:46.084 --> 03:47.484
You all right?

03:49.764 --> 03:51.604
Did you ask if you could be excused?

03:57.964 --> 03:59.124
Can I go get it?

04:04.004 --> 04:05.204
Please?

04:05.724 --> 04:07.044
Hurry back.

04:34.124 --> 04:35.284
Mr. Jackson.

04:36.484 --> 04:37.764
Can we have it back, please?

04:38.324 --> 04:40.004
Why should I do you another favor, Bea?

04:41.484 --> 04:43.404
I'm still waiting for you
to pay back the first one.

04:47.484 --> 04:49.244
You had no right to take that.

04:51.404 --> 04:53.404
You still think you can call the shots, eh?

04:58.644 --> 04:59.724
Go fetch.

05:10.724 --> 05:11.764
I won't be long.

05:20.964 --> 05:22.204
You never called.

05:24.444 --> 05:25.884
I've been stuck in here five weeks.

05:26.404 --> 05:27.444
How are you feeling?

05:29.404 --> 05:30.564
Bored.

05:32.924 --> 05:35.564
Mr. Channing's approved your
return to the compound tomorrow.

05:44.404 --> 05:46.524
I need you to know that
things have changed.

05:49.524 --> 05:51.444
The women have moved
in different directions.

05:54.124 --> 05:56.244
I need your guarantee that
you won't cause any trouble.

05:57.044 --> 05:59.004
No. No trouble.

06:00.924 --> 06:03.444
- Good.
- Who's the lucky guy?

06:04.324 --> 06:05.324
Hmm?

06:06.404 --> 06:07.844
The ring looks pretty pricey.

06:10.124 --> 06:12.604
- Who is he?
- He's none of your business.

06:19.124 --> 06:20.844
Sorry you got pinched again, Simmo.

06:21.324 --> 06:22.964
Sounds like I missed all the action.

06:23.044 --> 06:24.924
Well, there's always more to be had.

06:25.244 --> 06:27.724
Sweet. Spitz says "hi," by the way.

06:27.964 --> 06:29.444
Does he? That's nice.

06:29.844 --> 06:32.804
Sit down. He still driving for Vinnie?

06:33.084 --> 06:34.204
Yeah.

06:34.764 --> 06:35.964
Cheese?

06:39.044 --> 06:40.364
Vinnie still giving him grief?

06:40.444 --> 06:41.844
Oh, Spitz can be a dick.

06:42.044 --> 06:43.884
Well, Vinnie's not a patient man.

06:43.964 --> 06:45.604
I keep telling him to pull his head in.

06:45.684 --> 06:47.524
He's gonna lose his job just
when the work's picking up.

06:50.284 --> 06:53.804
I've heard. Don't worry,
nothing gets past me.

06:54.724 --> 06:56.684
Vinnie never could keep it in his pants.

06:59.364 --> 07:00.364
Help yourself.

07:03.844 --> 07:05.684
This Cass. I hear she's a bit of a tart?

07:06.844 --> 07:09.044
Vinnie gets Spitz to drive
her wherever she wants to go.

07:09.564 --> 07:12.524
Shopping, those massage places. Every day.

07:12.844 --> 07:15.124
- Easy work for him.
- Oh, he doesn't mind the day work.

07:15.204 --> 07:17.084
It's the nights he hates
when they're out on the town.

07:17.164 --> 07:18.364
Dipping into our money again.

07:18.444 --> 07:19.924
When will he ever learn?

07:20.764 --> 07:23.124
Spitz reckons they go hammer and
tongs in the backseat of the car.

07:23.244 --> 07:24.604
She's not shy, that's for sure.

07:26.684 --> 07:27.804
Sorry.

07:32.324 --> 07:34.044
You should go and say hello to the others.

07:34.124 --> 07:35.244
They'll be happy to see you.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.044
What?

07:47.884 --> 07:48.964
Can I come in?

07:52.164 --> 07:53.564
I just heard from Miss Davidson.

07:54.724 --> 07:55.884
Franky's coming out tomorrow.

07:56.724 --> 07:58.484
Oh. We'd better get started, then.

07:59.164 --> 08:00.924
Tell the girls we'll
have a talk after lunch.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.044
Is there a problem, Doreen?

08:05.444 --> 08:06.684
Not getting cold feet, are you?

08:07.764 --> 08:09.524
She broke her promise to you.

08:10.484 --> 08:12.764
Didn't give Toni the chance
to be a proper mother.

08:12.844 --> 08:15.484
The only person Franky cares
about is herself, remember that.

08:15.764 --> 08:17.684
- Yeah.
- All right.

08:18.204 --> 08:19.444
We'll talk later.

08:27.084 --> 08:29.284
So he's giving you the
heavy about Meg again, is he?

08:29.764 --> 08:32.124
No. He's just been in a really shitty mood.

08:32.683 --> 08:33.844
Hmm.

08:34.164 --> 08:36.364
Hey, did you hear Franky's
coming out tomorrow?

08:36.724 --> 08:38.203
Good. About time, eh?

08:39.724 --> 08:42.404
She's going to go feral when she
sees what Jackson's done to me.

08:42.484 --> 08:46.204
Don't bloody tell her. She'll
lose it, and she'll do something...

08:48.924 --> 08:50.444
- Stupid.
- Well, good.

08:50.684 --> 08:52.964
Do you want her to get
busted up, do you? Do you?

08:53.044 --> 08:54.764
- No!
- Settle down.

09:16.604 --> 09:17.964
Jacs wants her hair done again.

09:19.084 --> 09:20.644
She said to come to her unit after lunch.

09:22.684 --> 09:23.964
Got a problem with that?

09:24.764 --> 09:26.564
No. Bea hasn't got a problem, have you?

09:29.004 --> 09:30.044
No.

09:33.404 --> 09:34.684
Hey, Dor.

09:36.924 --> 09:38.524
Don't know why you bother.

09:39.004 --> 09:41.684
- 'Cause she's our mate.
- No, she's a traitor.

09:42.884 --> 09:45.324
Franky would never,
ever give Toni any gear.

09:45.644 --> 09:47.204
Franky didn't deny it.

09:47.284 --> 09:49.244
- Oh, can we not do this again?
- Traitor!

09:49.324 --> 09:52.204
You reckon Toni would have gone
into protection if it was a lie? No!

09:52.604 --> 09:55.004
Toni doesn't know what she's talking about!

09:55.084 --> 09:56.444
Her brain's fried!

09:56.524 --> 09:57.524
Shut up!

10:02.324 --> 10:03.644
That's lunch. Get out of my face.

10:22.124 --> 10:24.764
You can... You can sit here if you want.

10:33.884 --> 10:37.284
- Anything interesting?
- The usual. Death and footie.

10:40.564 --> 10:45.324
You know, uh, a mate gave me two box
tickets to the MCG on Saturday night.

10:47.964 --> 10:49.044
Good. Have fun.

10:51.164 --> 10:52.284
Yeah.

11:06.924 --> 11:08.244
Don't have to stop talking 'cause I'm here.

11:08.324 --> 11:09.324
We're not.

11:10.804 --> 11:14.124
So, um... What did you
get up to last night?

11:14.884 --> 11:16.404
Picked up this girl at the 7-11.

11:17.604 --> 11:19.484
Legs up to here, great tits.

11:20.164 --> 11:22.484
Didn't even get through the front
door before we were doing it.

11:22.804 --> 11:23.804
What about you, Vera?

11:24.404 --> 11:27.244
Let me guess, watched some TV
with your imaginary boyfriend?

11:27.964 --> 11:30.444
- Flick off over some Mills and Boon?
- Cut it out, Will.

11:32.804 --> 11:35.084
You, uh, must be pretty
good at it now, eh, Vera?

11:35.764 --> 11:36.844
That's enough.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.844
That's enough. Okay?

11:43.644 --> 11:45.044
Don't, don't.

11:51.924 --> 11:54.044
Don't you ever talk to her
like that again. All right?

11:54.564 --> 11:55.884
Ooh. Eh?

11:57.044 --> 11:58.484
Must have hit a nerve, eh, Fletch?

11:59.364 --> 12:01.204
What, she not putting out?

12:02.364 --> 12:03.684
Don't know what you
see in that crazy bitch.

12:03.764 --> 12:04.764
You on the drugs again?

12:05.244 --> 12:07.524
Aren't you? You idiot.

12:08.364 --> 12:10.204
Just leave Vera alone.

12:37.524 --> 12:38.564
Hmm.

12:47.764 --> 12:48.844
How's Debbie?

12:50.364 --> 12:52.004
- Good.
- Haven't seen you at the visitor's center

12:52.084 --> 12:53.084
for a while that's all.

12:53.164 --> 12:55.564
She's, uh... She's away on a school camp.

12:55.844 --> 12:57.804
That's nice. Whereabouts?

12:58.084 --> 13:00.804
Um... Blue Mountains, I think.

13:01.044 --> 13:02.244
Where in the Blue Mountains?

13:04.484 --> 13:05.764
Not sure.

13:07.204 --> 13:08.884
- Are you seeing Vinnie?
- No.

13:09.404 --> 13:11.324
Oh, just thought, you
know, with your hair and...

13:11.404 --> 13:14.084
Tomorrow's a big day. Franky's coming back.

13:15.284 --> 13:17.084
I thought I'd throw her
a welcome home party.

13:18.404 --> 13:19.644
Something special.

13:21.084 --> 13:22.404
Don't worry, you're invited, too.

13:22.484 --> 13:24.124
I've got a lot of little jobs for everyone.

13:25.764 --> 13:26.764
You can go now.

13:34.404 --> 13:35.564
- See ya.
- See ya.

13:35.764 --> 13:37.324
- Oh, hey, Vera.
- Yeah?

13:37.844 --> 13:40.244
I spoke to Will. Told
him he was out of line.

13:42.124 --> 13:43.724
Thanks. But, um...

13:45.204 --> 13:46.564
You know, it must be hard for him.

13:47.444 --> 13:49.044
Getting used to her not being around.

13:51.404 --> 13:53.684
Why don't you just go over
there? See if he's all right.

13:55.404 --> 13:56.644
I reckon I've done enough.

13:59.644 --> 14:01.044
Why can't they just be happy?

14:02.364 --> 14:03.564
Because it would be boring.

14:04.284 --> 14:07.124
Hey, have you noticed Davidson's
wearing an engagement ring?

14:07.524 --> 14:08.724
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

14:08.804 --> 14:09.844
What's it like?

14:09.924 --> 14:12.444
Ah, well, it doesn't look like plastic.

14:12.924 --> 14:14.044
Hey, Dor.

14:20.484 --> 14:21.484
Doreen.

14:23.204 --> 14:26.684
I, uh, saw Jacs and she said she's
got something planned tomorrow.

14:27.084 --> 14:28.124
For Franky.

14:28.804 --> 14:30.124
Any idea what it is?

14:32.684 --> 14:34.084
- Don't know.
- Doreen.

14:34.164 --> 14:36.164
- Hey, Dor.
- I don't know.

14:36.244 --> 14:37.324
You can tell us.

14:38.684 --> 14:39.684
What is it?

14:41.764 --> 14:43.364
Well?

14:45.524 --> 14:46.684
It's disgusting.

14:53.884 --> 14:55.164
They're gonna gang her.

14:55.964 --> 14:57.204
What... What's that?

14:58.484 --> 14:59.524
Rape.

15:01.644 --> 15:03.884
Years ago, you know, when I was new here

15:05.044 --> 15:08.004
there was this lady, Sally.
She was really nice to me.

15:08.524 --> 15:10.324
Jacs didn't like her,
saw her as competition,

15:10.404 --> 15:11.764
she wanted to take her out.

15:15.324 --> 15:18.404
They ganged her and
Jacs forced me to watch.

15:19.444 --> 15:22.324
And I will never forget Sal lying
on the floor of the workroom.

15:22.884 --> 15:25.324
And I tried to help her after they left.

15:27.124 --> 15:28.804
I took the screwdriver out.

15:30.604 --> 15:33.364
So when someone's ganged,
Dor, they never get over it.

15:33.444 --> 15:35.604
Sal only lasted two months
before she topped herself.

15:37.084 --> 15:41.484
I know Jacs is making life hard for
us, and we have to do what she says,

15:41.564 --> 15:43.884
- but, mate, this is...
- If I tell her "no,"

15:44.884 --> 15:46.524
are you gonna protect me?

15:48.164 --> 15:49.284
We've got no one.

16:10.684 --> 16:11.804
Take that.

17:08.763 --> 17:09.884
On your own?

17:10.684 --> 17:12.604
- No, I'm waiting for someone.
- Oh, right.

17:14.284 --> 17:15.523
What time's he getting here?

17:43.004 --> 17:45.004
Meg.  Another one?

17:45.724 --> 17:48.564
Oh, jeez. Not first thing in the morning.

18:06.164 --> 18:08.244
Why did you do it? Hmm?

18:18.084 --> 18:19.404
What the fuck?

18:45.804 --> 18:46.844
Hey, Will.

18:49.124 --> 18:50.164
Meg...

18:52.324 --> 18:53.404
Meg...

19:02.604 --> 19:03.804
You fucking idiot.

19:06.844 --> 19:07.924
That's it, mate.

19:14.484 --> 19:16.284
Just take it easy, mate. All right?

19:17.884 --> 19:20.604
- I'm gonna call an ambulance.
- Don't call the ambulance.

19:21.364 --> 19:22.884
If the department finds out, I'm gone.

19:30.444 --> 19:33.204
Packing up her stuff,
is that what set you off?

19:34.444 --> 19:35.644
Did the cops say something to you?

19:36.844 --> 19:38.964
- No.
- Do you want me to take it away

19:39.044 --> 19:40.204
for you, put it in storage?

19:40.284 --> 19:42.724
- I'm giving it to the Salvation.
- What, all of it?

19:44.524 --> 19:45.924
You don't want to keep anything?

19:47.364 --> 19:49.324
Maybe not now, mate, but,
you know, in time you will.

19:49.484 --> 19:50.484
The letter.

19:52.644 --> 19:53.764
What letter?

19:56.644 --> 19:57.764
It's on the counter.

20:14.244 --> 20:15.924
We were trying to get pregnant.

20:16.004 --> 20:17.284
We knew it'd be difficult.

20:18.004 --> 20:20.044
Almost given up thinking it would happen.

20:21.284 --> 20:22.964
Couple of days ago, that turned up.

20:26.164 --> 20:27.524
She killed my baby, Fletch.

20:30.324 --> 20:34.084
Three weeks before she
dies. Never said a word.

20:36.684 --> 20:38.084
Didn't even tell me she was pregnant.

20:39.204 --> 20:43.124
You... You sure about this? I mean,
it doesn't say that here, you know?

20:43.244 --> 20:44.324
I called them.

20:46.004 --> 20:48.524
They wouldn't tell me anything.
I had to prove she was dead.

20:52.324 --> 20:53.564
Why would she do it?

20:58.204 --> 20:59.604
Who knows what she was thinking.

21:02.404 --> 21:03.724
I don't give a shit.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.684
I'm not doing any more crying over her.

21:08.364 --> 21:09.644
I'm done.

22:07.804 --> 22:09.004
Can I talk to you for a minute?

22:17.364 --> 22:19.084
I used to get RSI when
I worked in the salon.

22:23.164 --> 22:24.884
Especially in the
winter. It hurt like hell.

22:26.804 --> 22:28.244
I found a heat pack helped.

22:31.804 --> 22:32.804
Is that arthritis?

22:37.004 --> 22:38.164
May I?

22:46.444 --> 22:47.804
I wanted to talk to you about Franky.

22:49.724 --> 22:51.244
About what you're going to do to her.

22:54.324 --> 22:56.564
No one should ever have to go
through something like that.

22:57.844 --> 23:00.244
I'm not just talking about her, I'm
talking about the other women, too.

23:02.844 --> 23:06.044
So I'm begging you, Jacs.
Please don't do this.

23:06.684 --> 23:07.924
You know it's not right.

23:11.764 --> 23:13.044
You've got guts.

23:14.444 --> 23:16.364
Coming in here, airing your opinions.

23:17.444 --> 23:19.484
No one else has been
brave enough to do that.

23:24.044 --> 23:26.524
Well, you'll get to go
home one day. Leave here.

23:26.924 --> 23:28.404
Go home to your family.

23:30.764 --> 23:32.244
What sort of woman will you be?

23:52.444 --> 23:53.524
All right?

23:54.884 --> 23:56.484
I didn't expect to see you this morning.

23:57.244 --> 23:59.084
Well, couldn't sit around at home.

24:00.044 --> 24:01.084
Nothing to do.

24:02.564 --> 24:03.724
How are you feeling?

24:14.724 --> 24:16.244
- Ah, Bea.
- Yeah?

24:18.644 --> 24:20.004
The stuff you ordered from the canteen.

24:21.204 --> 24:22.404
Thanks.

24:22.804 --> 24:24.244
Since when do you home deliver?

24:25.564 --> 24:27.364
I don't know, thought
I'd save you the walk.

24:29.284 --> 24:31.324
So, have you spoken to Debbie lately?

24:32.964 --> 24:34.084
Yeah.

24:34.924 --> 24:36.044
Good.

24:41.324 --> 24:42.564
I'll leave you to it.

25:21.084 --> 25:22.684
Oh, please...

25:23.004 --> 25:24.324
Please don't do this.

25:25.484 --> 25:26.564
Get on with it.

25:36.044 --> 25:37.084
What are you doing?

25:38.884 --> 25:39.964
Keep watch.

25:49.564 --> 25:50.804
Now one to the face.

26:06.764 --> 26:09.764
I can't send you back to the compound
if you're showing signs of aggression.

26:09.844 --> 26:11.044
I told you, I got light-headed.

26:11.124 --> 26:12.124
Too many push-ups.

26:13.364 --> 26:15.324
- Shit.
- What happened?

26:15.564 --> 26:16.604
Bea Smith.

26:16.924 --> 26:20.004
She was bashed in the
unit. Birdsworth found her.

26:20.084 --> 26:21.164
I don't know how long she's been there.

26:21.244 --> 26:23.204
- Did anyone see anything?
- What do you think?

26:23.284 --> 26:24.564
- Get her out of here.
- I'm going. I'm going.

26:24.644 --> 26:26.124
- Out!
- Move, Franky.

26:27.964 --> 26:29.004
Get off!

26:32.204 --> 26:33.404
Bea?

26:35.204 --> 26:36.324
Can you hear me?

26:37.244 --> 26:38.404
Who else was in the unit?

26:39.924 --> 26:42.404
- No one's there.
- Bea, do you know where you are?

26:43.684 --> 26:44.964
I wanted to stop them.

26:46.524 --> 26:49.244
I wanted to press the panic
button, but she wouldn't let me.

26:50.004 --> 26:51.684
Don't feel guilty about it, Dor.

26:51.764 --> 26:53.924
There was no point in you both copping it.

26:54.484 --> 26:56.124
I should have done something.

26:56.204 --> 26:59.044
No. Bea was right, Dor.

27:00.724 --> 27:03.884
She must have gone to Jacs right
after I opened my big mouth.

27:03.964 --> 27:07.484
That was Bea doing what she
thought was the right thing.

27:08.564 --> 27:12.244
And Jacs has her own way
of dealing with things.

27:13.204 --> 27:15.364
I'm sick of all the fighting, Liz.

27:16.684 --> 27:17.804
Me, too, love.

27:21.764 --> 27:23.124
I've missed you, Liz.

27:26.964 --> 27:28.964
Well, I've missed you, too, sis.

27:36.004 --> 27:37.764
Loss of consciousness, severe concussion,

27:37.844 --> 27:40.004
laceration to the head, bruising.

27:40.444 --> 27:43.044
No obvious sign of internal bleeding.

27:43.804 --> 27:45.524
We've got a nurse coming
round to clean her up.

27:49.604 --> 27:50.724
Was it Jacs Holt?

27:50.804 --> 27:53.324
I don't know, apparently, she was on the
other side of the compound at the time.

27:53.404 --> 27:54.524
Well, of course she was.

27:56.164 --> 27:57.604
Savage what that woman's capable of.

27:58.004 --> 28:00.044
You know, Will was in the area
but he didn't see anything,

28:00.124 --> 28:01.644
so they must have been
in and out pretty quick.

28:02.484 --> 28:04.124
- Looks like she's awake.
- Bea?

28:04.884 --> 28:06.164
Bea, you're in medical.

28:06.644 --> 28:08.524
You're going to be all right.

28:09.484 --> 28:12.644
Can you remember anything, Bea?
I need you to give me a name.

28:14.204 --> 28:15.284
Bea.

28:19.524 --> 28:20.764
How bad is she?

28:22.844 --> 28:23.924
Pretty bad.

28:25.164 --> 28:26.764
They should be paying us danger money.

28:27.244 --> 28:28.484
Especially after Meg.

28:38.044 --> 28:39.124
Do you want one?

28:41.564 --> 28:43.644
That unit's a mess, Vera.

28:44.924 --> 28:47.484
Blood all over my jacket
and shirt. It's crazy.

28:48.604 --> 28:51.124
No, don't use hot water.
It just sets the stain.

28:52.884 --> 28:54.524
- Grab that vinegar.
- Vinegar?

28:54.804 --> 28:56.804
Yeah, it works faster, so does salt.

28:57.444 --> 28:59.084
- Where'd you learn this?
- My mother.

29:01.444 --> 29:02.924
Well, at least Mum's good for something.

29:03.204 --> 29:05.444
You know, you shouldn't talk
about your mum like that, Vera.

29:05.524 --> 29:06.684
You don't know her.

29:09.684 --> 29:12.004
- You know, I owe you for this.
- That's fine.

29:12.204 --> 29:14.244
Maybe I could cook for
you sometime. You know?

29:14.964 --> 29:17.564
Bring us some lunch. Save you
eating those cardboard sandwiches.

29:17.644 --> 29:18.684
Matt...

29:19.524 --> 29:24.364
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I am
trying to keep it professional.

29:35.804 --> 29:37.244
You'd get bored with me.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.444
- Oh, I doubt that.
- Well, yes, you would. And...

29:42.764 --> 29:44.964
And then you'd dump me, and we'd
have to keep working together.

29:45.044 --> 29:46.644
And that would be really awkward

29:47.364 --> 29:49.164
and the others would
laugh at me all over again.

29:49.244 --> 29:51.524
My mother would have a field day and...

29:52.964 --> 29:54.524
And I would lose a good friend.

29:55.084 --> 29:58.364
Wow. You've really thought
this through, haven't you?

30:00.644 --> 30:02.164
This job means everything to me.

30:09.964 --> 30:11.284
I need to know what happened.

30:13.844 --> 30:15.564
Come on, did any of you see anything?

30:18.564 --> 30:20.244
How long's she gonna be in medical?

30:20.324 --> 30:22.324
- We're not sure.
- Can we see her?

30:22.964 --> 30:25.364
Yeah, the peer worker can, but
the rest of you will have to wait.

30:26.004 --> 30:27.964
Unless you can tell me something.

30:35.684 --> 30:36.924
I thought she was your friend.

30:46.164 --> 30:47.564
Was it Jacs?

30:49.564 --> 30:51.564
You don't have to say anything, just nod.

30:57.484 --> 30:59.004
Someone should tell Debbie.

31:01.204 --> 31:02.724
You know we don't make those calls, Liz.

31:02.844 --> 31:03.964
It'll be up to Bea.

31:04.044 --> 31:06.524
Can't you just bend the
rules once and call the kid?

31:08.404 --> 31:09.444
I'm sorry.

31:17.404 --> 31:19.444
You should go and see
her. She'll need a mate.

31:19.524 --> 31:20.604
I can't.

31:20.924 --> 31:23.644
- You're her bloody peer worker!
- Yeah, and I keep stuffing up!

31:23.724 --> 31:26.164
- Yeah!
- But you're learning.

31:27.204 --> 31:28.604
She just needs a mate there.

31:29.044 --> 31:30.164
You can do that.

31:31.884 --> 31:32.964
Yeah.

31:34.044 --> 31:36.804
I wish I could help, but I
already told you where I was.

31:39.004 --> 31:40.284
What about you?

31:41.444 --> 31:42.764
Oh, I don't know anything.

31:44.484 --> 31:45.684
Show me your hands.

31:47.524 --> 31:48.764
- Why?
- Just do it.

32:03.404 --> 32:05.204
- What happened?
- The girls were mucking around

32:05.284 --> 32:06.684
and Simmo whacked her hand on the door.

32:06.764 --> 32:08.204
I think Simone can speak for herself.

32:09.564 --> 32:11.164
- I hit the door.
- I don't believe you.

32:11.244 --> 32:12.324
Prove it.

32:15.724 --> 32:16.764
Let's go.

32:22.324 --> 32:23.964
Bea. Hey.

32:24.884 --> 32:25.924
Bea.

32:27.484 --> 32:28.524
Bea.

32:29.564 --> 32:30.684
Hey.

32:31.764 --> 32:33.804
Hey. What the fuck happened?

32:42.324 --> 32:44.564
- Come on.
- I need some water.

32:45.404 --> 32:46.484
Water.

32:53.164 --> 32:54.724
Here. Have a bit.

32:55.964 --> 32:57.604
- Did Jacs do it?
- Hey, what are you...

32:57.684 --> 32:58.764
What are you doing here?

32:59.164 --> 33:00.204
Just... Leave her alone.

33:00.284 --> 33:01.524
What's been going on since I've been gone?

33:01.604 --> 33:02.724
Just back off, Franky.

33:03.204 --> 33:04.244
What's with you?

33:04.324 --> 33:06.684
You just want to know who
did it, so you can use it.

33:07.044 --> 33:09.044
Oi! What did you do to stop it?

33:09.764 --> 33:10.964
- Franky...
- Yeah?

33:12.684 --> 33:14.364
Franky, the doctor needs
to finish your dressing,

33:14.444 --> 33:15.684
then we'll get you back to the compound.

33:16.164 --> 33:17.724
Then we can see who else missed me.

33:18.244 --> 33:19.404
Come on, Franky.

33:22.804 --> 33:24.484
I'm so sorry, Bea.

33:27.724 --> 33:29.004
It wasn't your fault.

33:31.084 --> 33:33.884
- I want to warn Franky.
- You can't, Bea.

33:33.964 --> 33:35.924
- No, I have to.
- Jacs will kill you, Bea.

33:36.004 --> 33:38.244
I need to warn her. Get her. Just get her.

33:51.844 --> 33:54.244
- Hey, Franky. Welcome back.
- Hey.

33:55.764 --> 33:56.844
Rox.

34:14.964 --> 34:16.204
Franky!

34:34.004 --> 34:35.043
Come on.

34:41.164 --> 34:42.324
Keep an eye on her.

34:42.884 --> 34:44.444
When she's alone, let me know.

35:27.524 --> 35:29.284
This is Wentworth Correctional Centre.

35:29.364 --> 35:32.564
Bea Smith has been injured. You
may want to make contact with her.

35:36.564 --> 35:38.124
- Miss me?
- Yeah. Did you miss me?

35:38.204 --> 35:39.324
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:40.044 --> 35:41.924
So, what did Bea do to piss Jacs off?

35:42.164 --> 35:43.204
- Don't know.
- Franky's coming.

35:43.924 --> 35:45.684
With her face kicked in, we'll
have to do something about it.

35:45.964 --> 35:46.964
Yep.

35:47.364 --> 35:48.764
We lost one to the other side.

35:49.404 --> 35:51.764
I guess Nana's been
throwing her fat arse around.

35:51.844 --> 35:53.484
Yeah, Jacs' fat arse!

35:54.124 --> 35:56.044
- I'm going to the gym.
- What about your hand?

35:56.124 --> 35:57.364
I'm a big girl.

36:09.004 --> 36:10.284
She's gone to the gym.

36:34.284 --> 36:35.284
Miss me?

37:21.004 --> 37:23.444
- Looks like I got the numbers.
- I'm gonna slash you up.

37:23.524 --> 37:24.604
Are you?

37:26.484 --> 37:28.524
- She speaks again, deck her.
- Mmm-hmm.

37:31.044 --> 37:32.124
I thought I heard something.

37:33.204 --> 37:35.604
Now, unless you want some action,
you should fuck off right now.

37:35.844 --> 37:36.964
Hurry up!

37:39.204 --> 37:41.124
Who was it? Anderson or Smith?

37:41.404 --> 37:42.604
I was expecting it.

37:44.284 --> 37:46.084
Originality's not your forte.

37:49.284 --> 37:50.804
Sorry to spoil your little plan.

37:57.564 --> 37:59.124
Look at you now. You're so small.

38:00.764 --> 38:01.804
Like a little old lady.

38:03.164 --> 38:04.164
Off you go.

38:09.004 --> 38:10.164
Get her hand.

38:12.324 --> 38:13.644
I just came here to work out.

38:15.324 --> 38:16.524
This one's for Bea.

39:02.764 --> 39:04.404
Bea made you come and get me, didn't she?

39:06.644 --> 39:08.004
Otherwise you wouldn't have said anything.

39:09.844 --> 39:11.844
I didn't want to go along with Jacs, but...

39:12.324 --> 39:14.324
- I didn't know how to get out of it.
- So, what?

39:14.644 --> 39:16.324
What were you gonna do?
Were you gonna watch?

39:16.404 --> 39:17.524
- No.
- You gonna have a go, too?

39:17.604 --> 39:18.604
No way.

39:19.164 --> 39:21.484
Jacs was at me the whole time
about what you did to Toni.

39:22.604 --> 39:24.844
I was scared, okay? I couldn't think.

39:25.884 --> 39:28.684
And you swear what you said before is true?

39:29.044 --> 39:31.084
I would never give Toni any gear.

39:32.364 --> 39:34.204
I wouldn't do that to
you or the little grommet.

39:37.404 --> 39:38.644
You let her get in your head.

39:39.644 --> 39:41.444
- I know.
- Yeah. Do you?

39:41.524 --> 39:42.644
- Yeah.
- Do you?

39:42.724 --> 39:43.724
Yeah, I do.

39:43.964 --> 39:45.604
'Cause I'm sick of
fucking repeating myself.

39:45.684 --> 39:48.684
I'm sorry, all right? And
now she'll know I helped.

39:52.164 --> 39:53.684
It's not you she's going after.

39:55.884 --> 39:57.204
Please, I need to see my mum.

39:57.404 --> 39:59.164
I'm sorry, we're in lockdown.

39:59.364 --> 40:01.004
I got a message. I think she's hurt.

40:01.084 --> 40:02.244
I've got this.

40:04.604 --> 40:07.244
You might be waiting a while,
but if you're happy to wait

40:07.324 --> 40:09.244
I'll go check with the
governor and your mum.

40:09.324 --> 40:11.164
Thanks. Is she all right?

40:12.364 --> 40:13.644
I'll be as quick as I can.

40:18.164 --> 40:20.724
More women are going to
get hurt, Bea, or worse.

40:21.884 --> 40:23.364
Turf wars get people killed.

40:25.524 --> 40:27.244
You know Jacs was attacked because of you?

40:29.284 --> 40:30.644
She'll make you pay for that.

40:31.524 --> 40:34.164
And next time, you might not be so lucky.

40:37.644 --> 40:38.884
You're a good person.

40:40.844 --> 40:42.604
I know that you want to do the right thing.

40:47.604 --> 40:48.804
Say it.

40:53.964 --> 40:55.404
- Governor?
- Not now.

40:58.044 --> 40:59.484
Tell me, Bea.

41:06.364 --> 41:07.804
Don't know, I blacked out.

41:14.524 --> 41:15.684
Bea's daughter is here.

41:15.764 --> 41:17.244
I know we're in lockdown,
but under the circumstances...

41:17.324 --> 41:18.764
Debbie... Debbie's here?

41:19.964 --> 41:21.164
She's here?

41:22.124 --> 41:23.444
She's in reception.

41:24.644 --> 41:26.044
You want to see your daughter?

41:28.084 --> 41:29.444
You tell me what happened.

41:33.244 --> 41:34.724
Just give me a name, Bea.

42:46.684 --> 42:48.004
Hello, sexy.

43:22.244 --> 43:23.364
That's beautiful.
