<i>** Ave</i>

00:04.638 --> 00:09.077
<i>** Ave</i>

00:09.210 --> 00:15.416
<i>** Verum corpus</i>

00:16.484 --> 00:19.420
<i>** Natum **</i>

00:19.553 --> 00:21.189
Lieutenant.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.324
Take a breath
and start over.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.293
You need to see this, Captain.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.261
One of our
radar satellites picked it up.

00:27.395 --> 00:30.364
It's a ship. A large one.
Over 1,000 feet.

00:30.498 --> 00:33.167
Is it transmitting?
Negative.

00:33.301 --> 00:34.635
Its transponder
seems to be off.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.270
It won't respond to any
of our contact requests.

00:36.404 --> 00:37.671
Could be a Kuznetsov.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.574
That close to shore?
Undetected?

00:40.708 --> 00:42.876
Aircraft carriers don't
just appear out of nowhere.

00:43.010 --> 00:44.812
Whoa.

00:44.945 --> 00:47.014
And they sure as hell
don't disappear into thin air.

00:47.148 --> 00:50.118
I've got another one.
Same size.
Bearing 183 degrees.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.686
Traveling 22 knots.
No active transponder.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.488
26 miles east
of the last one.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.390
Has to be a technical issue,
right?

00:56.524 --> 00:58.459
Well, we're not taking any
chances. Scramble a Hornet.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.094
I want a pilot to tell me
what he sees.

01:00.228 --> 01:01.795
Captain, radar satellites

01:01.929 --> 01:04.198
are picking up an incoming
projectile mid-flight.

01:04.332 --> 01:05.999
Looks like
a cruise missile inbound.

01:06.134 --> 01:08.068
Our missile warning satellites
didn't pick up the launch.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.404
We can try to confirm
with ground-based radar
if there's time.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.506
How fast is it traveling?

01:12.640 --> 01:15.243
Bearing 1-7-9 degrees
at Mach 5.5.

01:15.376 --> 01:16.844
Get STRATCOM
on the line <i>now.</i>

01:16.977 --> 01:18.446
And call Space Command,
see what they know.

01:18.579 --> 01:21.315
Calculating. At that distance,
we have 52 seconds to impact.

01:21.449 --> 01:22.683
STRATCOM on line five,
Captain!

01:23.551 --> 01:24.618
This is Captain Ridge.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.254
We got warning
of an inbound missile

01:26.387 --> 01:28.522
but no indication of launch.
You guys seeing anything?

01:28.656 --> 01:30.824
<i>No.</i>
That's a negative, sir.

01:30.958 --> 01:33.894
Stand by.
19 seconds to impact!

01:34.027 --> 01:36.297
Space Command reports
all systems nominal, sir.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.898
No solar flares
or weather events.

01:38.031 --> 01:40.401
Close the blast doors!
Everybody take cover!

01:40.534 --> 01:41.902
Blast positions!

01:43.371 --> 01:44.672
10 seconds!

01:44.805 --> 01:47.708
Nine, eight, seven...

01:47.841 --> 01:51.044
...six, five, four,

01:51.179 --> 01:53.547
three, two, one.

02:11.699 --> 02:16.103
<i>****</i>

02:16.237 --> 02:18.772
Ladies and gentlemen, this
concludes our demonstration.

02:20.107 --> 02:22.476
The bidding will be open
for 36 hours,

02:22.610 --> 02:24.812
beginning now.

02:24.945 --> 02:28.982
<i>****</i>

02:29.116 --> 02:33.787
<i>****</i>

02:38.091 --> 02:40.160
I have to say,
I was surprised by your call.

02:40.294 --> 02:41.495
I've never met Governor Nance.

02:41.629 --> 02:43.797
I didn't realize
he knew anything about me.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.799
Only a handful of people know
what I'm about to tell you,

02:45.933 --> 02:47.501
so whatever happens here,

02:47.635 --> 02:49.002
we're assuming
your discretion.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.740
After 41 years of
public service,

02:52.873 --> 02:55.175
Senator Warwick
has decided to retire.

02:55.309 --> 02:56.877
I'm sorry to hear that,
but I'm still not sure

02:57.010 --> 02:59.613
how that connects
to the Governor's
Legislative Director

02:59.747 --> 03:01.449
asking me to breakfast.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.451
Once Senator Warwick
steps down,

03:03.584 --> 03:04.552
the Governor
will have the authority

03:04.685 --> 03:06.153
to appoint his replacement.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.356
Your name came up.
Me?

03:08.489 --> 03:10.190
You've had a distinguished
military career,

03:10.324 --> 03:12.960
followed by a long
and, from what I hear,

03:13.093 --> 03:14.528
exemplary run
at the Bureau.

03:14.662 --> 03:15.763
You're serious?

03:15.896 --> 03:17.831
The Governor's actually
considering this?

03:17.965 --> 03:19.533
He's a good man, Harold.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.235
He's looking for
the right person.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.904
Whatever good you're doing
at the Bureau,

03:24.037 --> 03:26.039
think about how much more
you could accomplish
in the Senate.

03:26.173 --> 03:28.242
Real change
on a national level.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.379
You earned
this opportunity.

03:31.512 --> 03:33.647
The people of Virginia
need you.

03:33.781 --> 03:35.549
And what do <i>you</i> need?
Permission.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.485
To consider you
for the position.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.388
But I need to know
you'll say yes

03:40.521 --> 03:41.722
if we go
in your direction.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.197
<i>Senator?</i>

03:50.331 --> 03:53.200
I wasn't aware you had
political ambitions.

03:53.334 --> 03:56.604
<i>I</i> don't, but apparently,
the Governor thinks I should.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.406
Well, what does
Charlene think?

03:58.539 --> 04:00.708
I haven't told her yet.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.911
You're telling me
before telling your wife?

04:04.044 --> 04:07.448
Harold, please tell me
there's no trouble
in paradise.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.183
No. I value your opinion.

04:10.318 --> 04:11.852
And I already know
what she thinks,

04:11.985 --> 04:14.087
the Governor's got
an ulterior motive.

04:14.221 --> 04:16.690
I've always said
you married up.

04:16.824 --> 04:20.361
So he's interested in me for
more than my undeniable charm.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.730
I'm Black.
I'm law enforcement.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.432
I check some boxes.
Is that so bad?

04:24.565 --> 04:26.066
Not <i>those</i> boxes, no.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.602
But I'm in another one
of your boxes, Harold,

04:28.736 --> 04:30.471
and if the Governor
knows that,

04:30.604 --> 04:32.873
he may be under
the false impression

04:33.006 --> 04:36.610
that you are prone
to moral ambiguity.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.812
Because I work with <i>you.</i>
Mm.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.849
Because you put up with me.
Who I am, what I do.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.551
Because at times, you...

04:44.352 --> 04:45.719
Look the other way.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.689
I choose
the greater good.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.924
Which I see as admirable,

04:51.058 --> 04:54.662
and the Governor may see
as situational.

04:54.795 --> 04:58.231
Clamato, Clamahto.
Tornado, typhoon.

04:58.366 --> 05:00.968
Let's talk about
why I called.

05:01.101 --> 05:05.305
What do you know
about the National
Reconnaissance Office?

05:05.439 --> 05:06.940
I know it took
over 30 years

05:07.074 --> 05:09.477
for the government
to admit it exists.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.612
Mr. Ogden Greeley
works with them

05:11.745 --> 05:13.080
as a defense contractor.

05:13.213 --> 05:15.483
Or he <i>did.</i> Five days ago,
he went missing.

05:15.616 --> 05:18.686
Greeley has
SAP-level clearance.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.588
Everything there is to know

05:20.721 --> 05:23.156
about this country's
satellite technology,

05:23.290 --> 05:24.392
he knows it.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.960
The CIA assumed
he was abducted,

05:27.094 --> 05:30.263
possibly by the Iranians
or the Russians.

05:30.398 --> 05:31.432
That would be an act of war.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.133
If it had actually happened.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.969
The truth, I'm afraid,
is even more disturbing.

05:36.103 --> 05:38.271
Associates of mine
in the Middle East

05:38.406 --> 05:40.107
forwarded me a communique,

05:40.240 --> 05:43.577
one that I'm sure the people
in your intelligence community

05:43.711 --> 05:46.847
will hear about in short order
if they haven't already.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.751
<i>I am a patriot.</i>

05:50.884 --> 05:52.986
<i>I have tried and failed</i>
to convince

05:53.120 --> 05:54.788
<i>those charged with</i>
keeping America safe

05:54.922 --> 05:56.957
<i>to act responsibly.</i>

05:57.090 --> 05:59.993
<i>As a result, I have come to</i>
believe that the only way

06:00.127 --> 06:03.997
<i>to address our security issues</i>
is to exploit them,

06:04.131 --> 06:07.134
<i>to show the bureaucrats</i>
through military defeat

06:07.267 --> 06:09.570
<i>the flaws they are too blind</i>
to see on paper.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.371
<i>I have decided to sell</i>

06:11.505 --> 06:13.173
<i>my knowledge</i>
of the vulnerabilities

06:13.306 --> 06:14.775
<i>present in our</i>
satellite systems

06:14.908 --> 06:16.510
<i>to the highest bidder.</i>

06:16.644 --> 06:18.879
Greeley said he's taking bids.

06:19.012 --> 06:19.813
Who from?

06:20.614 --> 06:22.816
Well, there's the rub.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.718
North Korea,
Russia, <i>and</i> Iran?

06:24.852 --> 06:26.720
Those are the countries
Reddington knows about.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.321
We have to assume
there are others,

06:28.456 --> 06:30.624
as well as any number
of individual bad actors.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.426
The National
Reconnaissance Office.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.194
I've never heard of them.
For good reason.

06:34.327 --> 06:36.363
They design, build,
launch, and maintain

06:36.497 --> 06:37.965
all of America's
spy satellites.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.033
They're the backbone
of U.S. national security.

06:40.167 --> 06:43.003
Radar, radio,
military cell transmissions,

06:43.136 --> 06:45.973
the intel every
Pentagon general
and soldier in the field

06:46.106 --> 06:47.541
depends on
to defend this country.

06:47.675 --> 06:48.842
Yeah,
but Greeley's former NSA.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.478
He's got a wife and kids
in Bethesda.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.813
Lifers like him don't
usually just wake up

06:52.946 --> 06:54.414
and decide
to betray their country.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.550
Find the wife.
See what she knows.

06:56.684 --> 06:59.252
Agent Mojtabai and I will
reach out to the NRO and CIA,

06:59.386 --> 07:01.855
warn them about what's coming.
How much time do we have?

07:01.989 --> 07:04.357
Reddington says bidding ends
in 13 hours.

07:04.492 --> 07:07.795
<i>****</i>

07:07.928 --> 07:10.230
Sorry. It's a bit of
a war zone in here today.

07:10.363 --> 07:11.865
No problem,
Mrs. Greeley.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.400
We're sorry to take
more of your time.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.068
Agents from the Bureau
were here

07:15.202 --> 07:17.037
and some other people
from the NRO.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.773
Yes, we know. We're with
a specialized task force.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.775
Look, I want to help,
but like I said,

07:21.909 --> 07:23.677
Ogden didn't talk
about his work.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.713
<i>Whoever has him,</i>
the Russians or...

07:25.846 --> 07:27.280
<i>If he tells them</i>
what they want to know,

07:27.414 --> 07:29.216
<i>there's no reason</i>
to hurt him, right?

07:29.349 --> 07:30.417
They'll let him go?

07:30.551 --> 07:32.252
We believe it's possible
that he wasn't taken,

07:32.385 --> 07:33.487
that he chose to disappear

07:33.621 --> 07:35.523
and that he's selling
classified intelligence.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.625
Ogden? That's not possible.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.392
W-Why do you
believe that?

07:39.527 --> 07:42.496
Did you see anything or hear
anything that might help us?

07:42.630 --> 07:44.264
Can you think of anywhere
he might be hiding?

07:44.397 --> 07:45.666
<i>He's not hiding.</i>

07:45.799 --> 07:48.068
<i>If he's not here,</i>
it's because he can't be.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.837
Ogden is a good man.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.640
I know it's hard to imagine
he would betray his country...

07:52.773 --> 07:54.775
Not just his country.
His family.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.811
No. Ogden loves us.

07:58.779 --> 08:01.181
I know my husband.
He's a good man.

08:03.917 --> 08:04.918
Is it done?

08:06.153 --> 08:07.254
Mm-hmm.

08:07.387 --> 08:12.760
<i>****</i>

08:15.929 --> 08:21.301
<i>****</i>

08:21.434 --> 08:22.435
You're back.

08:24.404 --> 08:25.505
Oh!

08:25.639 --> 08:27.107
The Cape May Warbler.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.010
Anna, right?

08:30.143 --> 08:31.178
Anne.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.412
Anne.

08:33.647 --> 08:34.782
Meeting your friends
again?

08:34.915 --> 08:36.950
Escaping friends, actually.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.719
And work.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.453
Escaping it all
for today.

08:41.488 --> 08:43.023
You picked the right place
for that.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.359
Oh, you're an artist.

08:46.827 --> 08:47.961
Heavens no.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.331
I'm not fast enough
to finish most.

08:52.432 --> 08:54.668
Sometimes I just draw the nests.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.270
I like their nests.

08:58.405 --> 09:00.373
Funny how they go
to all that work,

09:00.507 --> 09:02.710
building a home,
raising a brood,

09:02.843 --> 09:04.144
and then leave it.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.547
It's kind of sad.

09:08.481 --> 09:09.917
But they're fun
to sketch.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.051
May I?

09:12.620 --> 09:13.687
Mm.

09:13.821 --> 09:20.894
<i>****</i>

09:21.028 --> 09:22.562
Oh, I like these
an awful lot.

09:23.664 --> 09:24.832
What is your name again?

09:25.465 --> 09:26.700
Raymond.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.370
Who's this little fella?

09:31.538 --> 09:32.572
Fox sparrow.

09:33.874 --> 09:36.076
Becoming quite rare
in this part of the country.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.846
Lives just
up the way here.

09:39.847 --> 09:40.914
Where?

09:41.682 --> 09:43.150
I could show you.

09:43.283 --> 09:46.553
<i>****</i>

09:46.687 --> 09:48.789
How long were
the two of you married?

09:49.522 --> 09:51.058
Almost 25 years.

09:53.393 --> 09:56.029
Cal died of lung cancer
a month before
our anniversary.

09:56.630 --> 09:57.865
Big smoker.

09:59.466 --> 10:01.101
Some people like
to live dangerously.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.704
Yes. Some do.

10:03.837 --> 10:06.539
<i>****</i>

10:06.674 --> 10:07.908
What do you do?

10:09.376 --> 10:11.144
I'm a fugitive.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.447
Number one on the FBI's
Most Wanted List.

10:14.581 --> 10:16.950
One, huh?

10:18.018 --> 10:19.252
I would've gone
with fourth.

10:21.321 --> 10:22.622
Now you're not just
a stranger,

10:22.756 --> 10:24.257
you're a stranger with
delusions of grandeur.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.096
Do you live near the park?

10:29.897 --> 10:31.464
I live in Kansas.

10:31.598 --> 10:33.967
Little town
north of Wichita.

10:34.101 --> 10:36.303
Wichita. Famous
for their linemen.

10:36.436 --> 10:37.905
Mm.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.773
So, what brings you
to New York City, Anne?

10:39.907 --> 10:41.809
Surely not just the birds.

10:41.942 --> 10:44.077
Show-tune trip.

10:46.914 --> 10:49.082
Cal and I were
real big theater folks.

10:51.218 --> 10:54.587
Anyway, after he passed,
I promised myself

10:54.722 --> 10:58.091
I'd go see some <i>real</i> theater
on Broadway.

10:58.225 --> 11:02.629
So, I clip my coupons,
save up all year,

11:02.763 --> 11:04.865
get myself a little place
at the Sheraton,

11:04.998 --> 11:07.300
and see as many shows
as I can in a week.

11:08.769 --> 11:11.071
What a delightful idea.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.173
Seeing <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i>
tonight.

11:13.306 --> 11:14.674
Last show of the trip.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.144
Is this it?

11:17.978 --> 11:19.279
The residence of our

11:19.813 --> 11:22.049
fox sparrow?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.817
It's where he was
last time.

11:23.951 --> 11:29.389
<i>****</i>

11:29.522 --> 11:32.025
I wonder what it is
about bird-watching.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.695
I find it so

11:36.596 --> 11:37.831
calming.

11:37.965 --> 11:40.968
<i>****</i>

11:41.101 --> 11:43.703
An escape from all the rest
of it, I suppose.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.840
I'd imagine a man
with your profession

11:46.974 --> 11:48.842
must be quite good
at escaping.

11:50.410 --> 11:53.480
Raymond, may I ask you
a personal question?

11:53.613 --> 11:54.848
Anything.

11:57.017 --> 12:00.153
Would you
be interested

12:01.388 --> 12:02.790
in half a chicken salad
sandwich?

12:05.826 --> 12:07.227
I think I would.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.334
Oh. That's my Uber.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.568
Oh.

12:16.804 --> 12:18.505
Ah.

12:18.638 --> 12:21.008
It was so nice
to see you again, Anne.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.577
I hope you enjoy
the show tonight.

12:24.711 --> 12:27.147
Oh, I will.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.249
I'm just sorry we couldn't
find that fox sparrow.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.719
Well, I'll be back
in a month.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.321
Maybe I can
find him then.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.189
Wait.
You don't live here?

12:36.323 --> 12:38.091
Sometimes.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.860
Seems like I'm always
on the move.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.361
Well, aren't I the heel?

12:42.529 --> 12:44.597
I realize I know
nothing about <i>you.</i>

12:44.731 --> 12:47.067
I've been doing
all the talking.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.202
I think it's been
just divine.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.205
Oh!

12:54.875 --> 12:56.443
Ah. I have to take this.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.212
I'm sorry.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.286
Did you speak with Marvin?

13:06.419 --> 13:08.889
Yes. We can cover
the retainer.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.123
<i>Talk to Zurich.</i>

13:10.257 --> 13:12.292
I want to fund the balance

13:12.425 --> 13:14.561
without compromising
any liquidity.

13:14.694 --> 13:16.229
You said you needed one hour.

13:16.897 --> 13:17.797
It's been three.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.267
Has it? Oh, my goodness.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.303
I feel like
a different person.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.405
You're unguarded, Raymond.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.274
It's not safe.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.776
A moment's peace
and an afternoon of freedom

13:29.910 --> 13:32.812
are rewards that
far outweigh the risk.

13:32.946 --> 13:35.482
<i>Just call Zurich and don't</i>
worry about me. I'm fine.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.419
I canceled it.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.022
Curtain time
isn't till 8:00,

13:42.155 --> 13:44.457
and I can get a cab
anytime.

13:44.591 --> 13:45.725
What do you have
in mind?

13:45.859 --> 13:47.460
You. Helping me.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.662
Finding a souvenir
for my sister.

13:49.796 --> 13:53.433
I know an extraordinary
tiny, <i>tiny,</i>

13:53.566 --> 13:55.936
"barely enough room
for the both of us"

13:56.069 --> 13:58.305
chocolate shop about

13:59.572 --> 14:01.174
seven or eight blocks
from here.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.275
Ooh.

14:06.779 --> 14:08.615
Agents Park and
Ressler. Come in, please.

14:08.748 --> 14:10.183
Jim Halloran,
Director of the NRO.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.219
This is Paul Thorn
from the DNI's office.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.187
Thanks for agreeing to meet.
We've seen the recording

14:14.321 --> 14:15.688
Assistant Director Cooper
sent over.

14:15.822 --> 14:17.657
And you believe Greeley
actually has the intel

14:17.790 --> 14:19.459
he's trying to sell?
No question.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.161
Greeley didn't just work
on our satellites.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.495
He helped design the software.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.031
Wrote much of
the code himself.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.365
This country's
national defense

14:25.498 --> 14:27.667
is entirely dependent
on satellite technology.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.070
You realize what kind of
threat we're dealing with?

14:30.203 --> 14:32.139
If we fire a missile,
it's guided by satellites.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.641
When someone fires
a missile at us,
we detect it the same way.

14:34.774 --> 14:37.410
We use them to track
every jet, ship, Humvee,
and soldier we have.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.279
And Greeley can
shut them down?

14:39.412 --> 14:40.880
It's worse than that.

14:41.014 --> 14:43.316
<i>He knows enough to damage</i>
the satellites irreparably.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.518
<i>Greeley's code</i>
<i>is on dozens</i>
of our critical systems.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.020
<i>What if he designed</i>
a back door?

14:47.154 --> 14:49.022
<i>Every asset he touched</i>
could be infiltrated.

14:49.156 --> 14:51.324
<i>He could be</i>
<i>handing our enemies</i>
command and control.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.926
<i>All our data</i>
would be sent to them.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.228
<i>Our drones could be landed</i>
at their airfields.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.496
If they're smart,
they'll make us <i>think</i>

14:56.629 --> 14:58.331
we have accurate intel
when we don't.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.167
Drones and aircraft
can't be very effective

15:00.300 --> 15:02.469
if they're seeing enemy
targets that don't exist.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.504
Or <i>not</i> seeing
enemy targets that <i>do.</i>

15:04.637 --> 15:07.941
If an enemy of
the United States
buys that intel and uses it,

15:08.075 --> 15:09.842
we're looking at a war
we can't win.

15:16.516 --> 15:19.319
I found him!
We asked allied
intelligence agencies

15:19.452 --> 15:22.522
for intel on Greeley,
and they sent us this.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.057
Five months ago,
in a Berlin hotel.

15:24.191 --> 15:25.692
What was he doing there?

15:25.825 --> 15:28.061
Uh, whatever it was,
it, um,

15:28.195 --> 15:29.262
wasn't with his wife.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.434
So much for the devoted
family man. Who's she?

15:34.567 --> 15:35.768
The BND doesn't know.

15:35.902 --> 15:37.904
But I'm running it through
the NSA databases now.

15:38.038 --> 15:40.073
We're gonna need
to move on this
as soon as we get an ID.

15:40.207 --> 15:41.541
Is Mr. Cooper
coming down?

15:41.674 --> 15:44.077
Actually, he went out. Said he
had some personal business.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.980
Personal business? When we're
trying to stop a war in space?

15:47.114 --> 15:49.182
That's a little
melodramatic.

15:49.316 --> 15:50.650
What would <i>you</i> say
this is?

15:50.783 --> 15:53.086
An attempt to gain control
of our space-based
communications,

15:53.220 --> 15:54.954
which could cripple
our defense network,

15:55.088 --> 15:56.389
rendering us powerless
in a war against

15:56.523 --> 15:58.391
any number
of adversaries.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.395
Yeah.
So, like I said...

16:02.529 --> 16:04.064
How could he leave us
at a time like this?

16:06.166 --> 16:07.400
"Senator Cooper."

16:08.268 --> 16:10.503
I like
the sound of that.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.039
I was hoping you'd think
it sounded ridiculous.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.241
Why, honey?

16:14.374 --> 16:16.309
I can't think of a better man
for the job.

16:16.443 --> 16:17.977
Well, there are.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.612
Which makes me wonder
why they want me.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.614
There has to be a reason.

16:21.748 --> 16:24.651
I can think of at least
three reasons

16:25.618 --> 16:28.921
you're decent, honest, caring.

16:30.757 --> 16:34.261
Reddington says it's because
I'm morally flexible,

16:35.762 --> 16:38.231
that I can be counted on
to look the other way.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.333
Raymond Reddington
is a bad person

16:40.467 --> 16:42.435
and a worse
judge of character.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.205
Just makes me want to bust,

16:45.338 --> 16:47.807
a man like that judging
a man like you. Oh!

16:47.940 --> 16:50.843
Hey. How about
you don't bust

16:50.977 --> 16:53.012
and we focus on what we're
gonna say to the Governor?

16:53.146 --> 16:55.815
Yeah. Ooh!
"Governor Cooper."

16:55.948 --> 16:57.684
I like the sound
of that, too.

16:57.817 --> 17:00.653
Almost as much
as "President Cooper."

17:00.787 --> 17:02.955
Now, I <i>love</i>
the sound of that.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.094
Mwah.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.398
Senator, may I introduce
Assistant Director Cooper

17:11.531 --> 17:12.865
and his wife, Charlene.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.367
My pleasure
to meet you both.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.869
You made
a wise choice.

17:17.003 --> 17:19.206
She's as biased
as she is blunt.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.673
Well, as she should be.

17:20.807 --> 17:23.810
But you're not here to lobby.
I'm already a fan.

17:23.943 --> 17:24.811
Please. Sit, sit, sit.

17:24.944 --> 17:26.045
Thank you.

17:28.115 --> 17:29.249
Thank you, dear.

17:29.382 --> 17:32.018
I'm sorry to start this way,
but I'm working a case.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.854
If it breaks,
I'll have to step away.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.523
Sounds serious.
It is.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.625
Unfortunately, I can't discuss
any of the details.

17:38.758 --> 17:42.329
How marvelous. You're one of
the few people whose
access to classified intel

17:42.462 --> 17:45.265
may be less when
you become a senator.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.667
We were surprised to hear
that you were stepping down.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.237
Well, don't tell anyone,
but I'm 68,

17:50.370 --> 17:52.305
and I think it's time
to make way

17:52.439 --> 17:54.907
for fresh blood,
new ideas.

17:55.041 --> 17:57.344
But let's talk about you.

17:57.477 --> 17:58.878
Well, that's my favorite
subject, Senator.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.851
It's so counterintuitive...
I never would have considered

18:04.984 --> 18:06.386
a lack of...
Oh, no, no, no, no!

18:06.519 --> 18:08.087
Uh...
Please, please.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.522
I insist.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.091
If I'd known
you were paying,

18:12.225 --> 18:14.594
I would have picked a much
more expensive bottle.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.463
Mm. Well, I loved it.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.897
What's it called again?
I don't know.

18:18.030 --> 18:19.899
Some French red

18:20.032 --> 18:23.035
that's just old enough to
go perfectly with chocolate.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.071
Mm.
I think we've successfully

18:25.205 --> 18:27.840
polished off all
the champagne truffles.

18:27.974 --> 18:30.042
Did you try
the lavender ones?
I did.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.478
I must say,

18:31.611 --> 18:33.813
I found the lavender
to be a little

18:34.847 --> 18:36.082
too much lavender.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.884
Right?

18:38.017 --> 18:39.419
It was.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.254
There's not much
left here.

18:41.388 --> 18:42.522
You're definitely
gonna need to get

18:42.655 --> 18:44.657
something else
for your sister.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.526
Maybe an "I Heart New York"
t-shirt.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.396
Or a Statue of Liberty.

18:49.529 --> 18:52.031
Or an Eiffel Tower.
They also sell those here.

18:57.036 --> 18:59.639
So, tell me more
about your work.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.941
You said you were
in the Navy?

19:02.074 --> 19:04.177
That was a lifetime ago.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.179
Now I have my own
business.

19:07.214 --> 19:08.448
What do you do?

19:10.183 --> 19:11.584
I consult.

19:14.086 --> 19:15.655
Data profiling.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.990
Operational guidance.

19:18.124 --> 19:21.361
Client relocation.
Financial services.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.397
That sounds mysterious.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.165
Who do you consult for?

19:27.133 --> 19:28.735
All sorts.

19:28.868 --> 19:32.104
Past few years, I've had
a government contract.

19:32.239 --> 19:34.674
Threat assessment
for the government.

19:34.807 --> 19:38.110
That sounds like more fun
than Cottonwood Falls.

19:38.245 --> 19:39.579
I don't know, Anne.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.013
I think your life
sounds rather

19:41.814 --> 19:42.915
balanced.

19:43.483 --> 19:44.617
Thank you.

19:45.452 --> 19:46.686
I like to think it is.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.557
Do you like
Alfred Hitchcock?

19:50.690 --> 19:52.959
<i>Rear Window?</i>
Strangers on a Train?

19:53.092 --> 19:55.828
I saw <i>The Birds.</i>
I didn't like it.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.364
Well, you're a bird-watcher.

19:57.497 --> 19:58.965
Of course you didn't
like a movie

19:59.098 --> 20:01.701
about gangs
of murderous birds.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.836
What about
North by Northwest?

20:03.970 --> 20:06.739
It's playing at
the Village East tomorrow,

20:06.873 --> 20:08.308
midnight screening.

20:08.441 --> 20:09.976
I fly out
tomorrow morning.

20:10.109 --> 20:11.110
Change your flight.

20:13.580 --> 20:14.847
Is that someone you know?

20:14.981 --> 20:17.049
Yes. He's a colleague.

20:17.183 --> 20:19.652
Work always seems
to find me.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.855
I'm terribly sorry, Anne.

20:22.989 --> 20:27.494
This has been the most
wonderful afternoon.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.363
But I need to go.

20:30.497 --> 20:32.365
And you have a curtain time
to make.

20:32.499 --> 20:33.666
Hm, yes.

20:35.134 --> 20:37.169
May we offer you a ride
back to the Sheraton?

20:37.304 --> 20:39.706
Oh, no, no, no.
I think I'm gonna walk.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.310
But promise me one thing,

20:43.443 --> 20:46.979
that you'll at least consider
changing your flight.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.783
If you do, you'll find me
waiting for you

20:50.917 --> 20:54.754
under the marquee
at the Village East

20:54.887 --> 20:56.155
tomorrow at midnight

20:56.289 --> 20:58.057
with two tickets

20:58.190 --> 21:00.660
for <i>North by Northwest.</i>

21:00.793 --> 21:02.695
I will certainly
think about that.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.731
Well, it's a sincere offer.

21:05.732 --> 21:08.034
Hitch and I will be
tickled pink

21:08.167 --> 21:10.303
if you decide to join us.

21:10.437 --> 21:13.072
Thank you for the delicious
wine and chocolates.

21:13.205 --> 21:14.541
Oh, my pleasure.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.609
I'll get our coats.

21:18.578 --> 21:19.912
Did you speak
with Zurich?

21:20.046 --> 21:21.981
The assets
are available.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.616
Then let's make a deal.

21:23.750 --> 21:24.717
Thank you.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.590
Task Force has done
yeoman's work.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.224
Now, you are
to be commended.

21:33.593 --> 21:35.628
Appointing him senator
is commendation enough.

21:36.563 --> 21:37.730
If I am sworn in,

21:37.864 --> 21:39.666
I'm gonna need an incredible
amount of guidance.

21:39.799 --> 21:40.833
I'll do whatever I can
to help you.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.301
I'm sure you feel
the same way.

21:42.435 --> 21:43.903
Of course.
That's good to know,

21:44.036 --> 21:46.773
because within two weeks
of your being sworn in,

21:46.906 --> 21:48.608
you're gonna have to vote
on the Black Budget.

21:48.741 --> 21:51.243
That's appropriations
for everything

21:51.378 --> 21:52.845
from the CIA to the NSA.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.914
The National
Reconnaissance Office?

21:55.047 --> 21:56.949
These agencies are vital
to our national security.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.151
What they do,

21:59.285 --> 22:01.954
I'm not sure that even you
are classified to know about.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.490
I know enough
to know their value.

22:03.623 --> 22:05.124
When we vote
on the Black Budget,

22:05.257 --> 22:07.293
we just vote
on a total number.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.261
We don't get to see the line
items, we don't know where

22:09.396 --> 22:11.831
the money goes, we don't know
what programs it pays for.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.165
We're given a total number.

22:13.299 --> 22:16.569
We are told to vote
yea or nay.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.805
The number this year
is $80 billion.

22:18.938 --> 22:22.609
So I'm asking for your promise
that you will vote yea.

22:22.742 --> 22:24.977
Well, I'm sure I will.
I-I haven't given it...

22:25.111 --> 22:27.614
Selecting my replacement
is up to the Governor,

22:27.747 --> 22:30.783
but he's agreed not to pick
anybody over my objection.

22:35.121 --> 22:35.988
I'm so sorry.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.558
No. Go.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.460
Give me time to get to know
your lovely wife better.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.531
Tell me.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.999
We picked up security footage
of Greeley canoodling

22:47.133 --> 22:49.769
with a Russian spy
named Nina Kurylenko.

22:49.902 --> 22:51.638
Does the Russia desk
have anything?

22:51.771 --> 22:54.006
They have Kurylenko landing
in London a few hours ago.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.576
I want you and Agent Park
there ASAP.
How are we on time?

22:56.709 --> 22:58.077
Bidding closes
in seven hours.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.179
Go. See if Kurylenko
knows anything.

23:00.312 --> 23:02.982
<i>****</i>

23:03.115 --> 23:04.884
I'm afraid
I have to go.

23:05.017 --> 23:07.720
No problem.
As long as Charlene stays.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.556
Promised myself
a two-martini lunch.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.090
I'm only halfway
toward my goal.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.193
I'll call you later.
All right, baby.

23:14.326 --> 23:15.327
Thank you.

23:15.462 --> 23:17.564
Harold, about
what I asked for...

23:17.697 --> 23:19.398
I hope you'll agree to it.

23:19.532 --> 23:21.000
I do so want this to work.

23:29.676 --> 23:31.678
Sir, uh, here's
what you asked for.

23:34.814 --> 23:36.382
That's it?
Just the total amount?

23:36.516 --> 23:37.984
No itemized allocations?

23:38.117 --> 23:39.185
Well, it's, uh,

23:39.318 --> 23:40.953
called a Black Budget
for a reason, sir.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.354
Thank you, Aram.

23:42.489 --> 23:44.624
Yeah, I know the NRO gets
its funding this way.

23:44.757 --> 23:45.892
Is, uh, is this
about Greeley?

23:47.694 --> 23:48.895
Close the door
on your way out.

23:50.329 --> 23:51.564
Okay.

23:55.602 --> 23:58.070
I need you to do me a favor.

23:58.204 --> 24:00.039
Shedding light
on the Black Budget?

24:00.172 --> 24:02.441
That'll be fun.
Send Dembe what you have.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.577
I'll give it a read
and make some calls.

24:05.678 --> 24:07.279
As I was saying...

24:07.413 --> 24:09.849
You weren't saying.
You were raining
all over my parade.

24:09.982 --> 24:11.751
I understand what
she means to you,

24:12.451 --> 24:14.887
what she represents,

24:15.021 --> 24:17.323
but you walked away from an
ordinary life a long time ago.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.791
Dembe, it's a movie.

24:18.925 --> 24:21.027
She doesn't know
who you are.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.895
She'll get hurt,
Raymond.

24:23.763 --> 24:25.031
You don't want that.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.933
The only person
who's going to get hurt

24:27.066 --> 24:29.101
by our going to see
North by Northwest

24:29.235 --> 24:31.971
is Martin Landau when
he falls off Mt. Rushmore.

24:32.104 --> 24:36.108
<i>****</i>

24:36.242 --> 24:39.378
Now, this damn deal.
Let's review the finer points.

24:42.148 --> 24:43.616
<i>You're sure</i>
it's Kurylenko?

24:43.750 --> 24:44.817
Sure as we can be.

24:46.953 --> 24:49.822
I don't want to get too close,
but I'm telling you, it's her.

24:49.956 --> 24:51.257
Sir, uh,
we're already out of time.

24:51.390 --> 24:52.792
The bidding closed
an hour ago.

24:52.925 --> 24:54.126
Move now.

24:54.260 --> 24:55.928
If it's her, get her back
to the safe house

24:56.062 --> 24:57.830
<i>as quickly as possible.</i>

24:59.599 --> 25:02.268
<i>****</i>

25:02.401 --> 25:05.004
Don't look now, but the woman
who's been watching you,

25:05.137 --> 25:06.472
she's headed
our way now.

25:06.606 --> 25:07.907
Hey, Park, you got a visual?

25:08.040 --> 25:09.241
Can't see.
Give me a minute.

25:11.644 --> 25:13.145
She's on the move.

25:13.279 --> 25:19.385
<i>****</i>

25:19.518 --> 25:25.692
<i>****</i>

25:25.825 --> 25:32.064

25:34.667 --> 25:39.371

<i>****</i>

25:58.424 --> 26:03.495
<i>****</i>

26:03.630 --> 26:04.897
Ressler!
She's running!

26:05.031 --> 26:06.332
Headed south
toward the alley.

26:06.465 --> 26:11.537
<i>****</i>

26:11.671 --> 26:14.306
Nina Kurylenko.
Nice to meet you.

26:14.440 --> 26:19.211
<i>****</i>

26:19.345 --> 26:21.347
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

26:21.480 --> 26:24.550
My name is Marjorie Ellis.
I'm a British national.

26:24.684 --> 26:27.019
You're from England.
And you're from America.

26:27.153 --> 26:29.021
You have
no jurisdiction here.

26:30.222 --> 26:31.724
We know about
you and Greeley.

26:31.858 --> 26:33.292
The hook-ups in Berlin.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.027
That you're FSB.
You turned him.

26:35.161 --> 26:36.929
Convinced him to steal
classified intel.

26:37.063 --> 26:40.032
So, do us all a favor,
drop the act.

26:44.003 --> 26:45.872
I have nothing to say.

26:46.005 --> 26:47.306
We're not the people
you stiff, Nina.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.608
We're the people you talk to.
Because if you don't,

26:49.742 --> 26:52.078
we'll just hand you over
to the CIA.

26:52.211 --> 26:54.781
They'll drop you into a hole
that doesn't exist.

26:54.914 --> 26:57.183
Telling us what you know
is the only thing that stands

26:57.316 --> 27:00.086
between you
and a deep, dark hole.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.389
I'm supposed to believe
you want to help me?

27:03.522 --> 27:04.791
I <i>don't</i> want to help you.

27:04.924 --> 27:06.458
But I will if it gets us
to Greeley

27:06.592 --> 27:08.160
before he sells that intel.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.697
Now, if you help us
stop him in time,

27:10.830 --> 27:12.965
I'll personally escort you
to the Russian embassy.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.433
You have my word.

27:14.566 --> 27:16.068
To hell with that.
We're not releasing her.

27:16.202 --> 27:17.436
She's not our priority.

27:17.569 --> 27:19.605
She's an enemy operative.
You don't get to decide

27:19.739 --> 27:21.240
when to apply the law
and when to ignore it!

27:21.373 --> 27:23.575
Greeley's about to compromise
national security.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.912
It's worth letting her go
to protect that.

27:26.045 --> 27:28.881
You clearly think so. I doubt
Main Justice will agree.

27:29.015 --> 27:35.654
<i>****</i>

27:35.788 --> 27:37.189
In about 10 minutes,

27:37.323 --> 27:38.691
the CIA is gonna come
through that door.

27:38.825 --> 27:40.592
You tell me where he is,
I'll handle it.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.395
Why should I trust you?

27:43.529 --> 27:44.831
You were assigned
to Greeley.

27:44.964 --> 27:47.299
To convince him
to betray his country.

27:47.433 --> 27:49.101
Talk to me, Nina.
You don't have much time.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.706
The intel he stole, has he
sold it to you, to Russia?

27:55.574 --> 27:57.143
He told me what it was

27:57.276 --> 28:00.479
so I could assist
my government
in making a competitive bid.

28:00.612 --> 28:02.648
But whether they bid
the most or not,

28:02.782 --> 28:06.452
you brought me here
before I could find out.

28:06.585 --> 28:09.388
So, you don't know who,
but do you know when or where?

28:12.424 --> 28:15.261
To save yourself,
you have to give up Greeley.

28:15.394 --> 28:17.797
I can't help him, Nina,
but I <i>can</i> help you.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.298
If you help me.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.535
The meeting to sell the intel.

28:23.669 --> 28:24.703
Where's it gonna be?

28:28.440 --> 28:29.842
Mongolia?

28:29.976 --> 28:32.444
<i>Meeting's in four hours.</i>
Outside of Ulaanbaatar.

28:32.578 --> 28:35.147
Kurylenko...
You believe her?
I do.

28:35.281 --> 28:37.249
We have to get to Greeley
before he enters the country.

28:37.383 --> 28:38.517
Too late.
He's already there.

28:38.650 --> 28:40.219
Who's the buyer?
Kurylenko doesn't know,

28:40.352 --> 28:42.922
but Mongolia sits
between Russia and China,

28:43.055 --> 28:44.690
so my money's
on one of them.

28:44.824 --> 28:47.059
The Mongolians aren't
gonna let us roll in
and start making arrests.

28:47.193 --> 28:49.195
Even if they would,
we can't get there in time.

28:49.328 --> 28:50.997
And if we tell the Mongolian
government the truth,

28:51.130 --> 28:53.665
then we have to reveal
that Greeley's carrying
classified intel.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.002
How do we know they won't
read it? Or copy it?

28:56.135 --> 28:59.038
So we can't stop him ourselves
and we can't ask for help.

28:59.171 --> 29:00.172
We're out of options.

29:01.173 --> 29:02.241
What about the
Disposition Matrix?

29:02.374 --> 29:03.575
<i>The what?</i>

29:03.709 --> 29:05.577
It's the official term
for the federal Kill List.

29:05.711 --> 29:07.379
Wait. So you're...
You're saying we should
assassinate him?

29:07.513 --> 29:09.548
We could scramble a drone
from Kandahar.

29:09.681 --> 29:11.550
And there's a difference
between assassination

29:11.683 --> 29:13.352
and targeted killing
by the military.

29:13.485 --> 29:15.221
Well, whatever you call it,
we'd still be executing

29:15.354 --> 29:17.756
an American citizen
without due process.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.892
<i>Due process takes time.</i>
If this is an act of war...

29:20.026 --> 29:21.160
Is that what this is?

29:21.293 --> 29:22.694
...are we supposed to risk
national security

29:22.829 --> 29:24.363
to stop and ask a court
for permission?

29:24.496 --> 29:26.032
Yes! We are!

29:26.165 --> 29:27.967
I haven't seen
the Kill List used
in a case like this before.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.535
Are we sure
it's even possible?

29:29.668 --> 29:32.171
No. But we have
a duty to present
the facts to the NSC

29:32.304 --> 29:33.539
while there's
still time to act.

29:33.672 --> 29:36.075
Sir. Ressler. Guys. Come on.
You can't be okay with this.

29:36.208 --> 29:38.945
Look, Aram,
we're out of options.

29:39.078 --> 29:41.213
Call the White House.
Let them know I'm on the way.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.356
Who's in there?

29:50.489 --> 29:51.790
President's on the line
from <i>Air Force One.</i>

29:51.924 --> 29:53.125
Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs.

29:53.259 --> 29:54.760
Principals from
the National Security Council.

29:54.894 --> 29:56.095
That includes
the Secretary of State

29:56.228 --> 29:59.065
and Defense
by remote link.

29:59.198 --> 30:01.233
Is the President
ordering a strike?

30:01.367 --> 30:03.135
They're discussing
his authority.

30:03.269 --> 30:07.206
<i>****</i>

30:07.339 --> 30:10.109
Assistant Director Cooper.
Thanks for your patience.

30:10.242 --> 30:12.278
We have a few questions.
Of course.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.180
As you know,
all the targeted killings

30:14.313 --> 30:15.982
carried out
in the last 20 years or so

30:16.115 --> 30:17.749
have been connected to
the global War on Terror.

30:17.884 --> 30:19.218
Yes.

30:19.351 --> 30:21.453
President's authority derives
from the 2001 Authorization

30:21.587 --> 30:24.056
to Use Military Force,
passed after 9/11.

30:24.190 --> 30:26.859
Our concern is
that authority
doesn't apply here.

30:26.993 --> 30:29.028
Greeley is not
a known terrorist.

30:29.161 --> 30:30.796
He has no link
to Al Qaeda or ISIS

30:30.930 --> 30:32.598
or any other
terrorist organization?

30:32.731 --> 30:34.466
He appears to be acting
as an individual

30:34.600 --> 30:35.968
for his own
financial gain.

30:36.102 --> 30:37.336
That complicates the matter.

30:37.469 --> 30:39.105
Under Article 2
of the Constitution,

30:39.238 --> 30:40.973
the President has
the general power

30:41.107 --> 30:43.309
to defend this country
from imminent attack.

30:43.442 --> 30:44.776
The problem is, we don't know
how "imminent"

30:44.911 --> 30:46.045
the attack might be.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.247
That's true. Greeley isn't
selling a weapon.

30:48.380 --> 30:50.849
He's selling intelligence
that may be used as a weapon.

30:50.983 --> 30:52.919
And we're not at war with
any of the potential buyers.

30:53.052 --> 30:55.254
We haven't declared war,
but that doesn't mean

30:55.387 --> 30:57.223
an enemy hasn't
declared war against us.

30:57.356 --> 30:58.457
If they're buying
our intelligence,

30:58.590 --> 31:01.027
we have to assume
they intend to use it.

31:01.160 --> 31:04.030
Are we really supposed to wait
until North Korea or Iran

31:04.163 --> 31:05.864
has attacked us
with our own technology

31:05.998 --> 31:07.299
before we can
defend ourselves?

31:07.433 --> 31:09.335
<i>Greeley's</i>
an American citizen.

31:09.468 --> 31:11.303
<i>That means he has</i>
<i>a Constitutional right</i>
to due process.

31:11.437 --> 31:12.804
<i>That right's</i>
not absolute.

31:12.939 --> 31:14.806
<i>Sure, if he were in D.C.,</i>
we'd arrest him,

31:14.941 --> 31:16.342
<i>but he made that impossible.</i>

31:16.475 --> 31:17.910
<i>Our people can't</i>
get there in time.

31:18.044 --> 31:19.678
The U.N. Charter requires us

31:19.811 --> 31:21.213
<i>to notify the Mongolians</i>

31:21.347 --> 31:23.115
<i>before executing a strike</i>
on their soil.

31:23.249 --> 31:24.816
We didn't notify
the Pakistanis

31:24.951 --> 31:26.318
before we went
after Bin Laden.

31:26.452 --> 31:28.554
We took
the position that
notification isn't needed

31:28.687 --> 31:30.856
if the country involved
is "unwilling and unable"

31:30.990 --> 31:32.224
to intervene.

31:32.358 --> 31:34.426
We can't notify
the Mongolians, Diane.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.529
We can't let anyone know
that intel's in play.

31:37.663 --> 31:40.199
<i>We also have no</i>
extradition treaty.

31:42.168 --> 31:43.669
Mr. President.

31:43.802 --> 31:45.404
We have less than
three hours, sir.

31:45.537 --> 31:48.040
If you intend to act,
we need to know now.

31:48.174 --> 31:53.479
<i>****</i>

31:53.612 --> 31:55.181
<i>Where are you?</i>

31:55.314 --> 31:57.849
Waiting outside
the conference room.
It's almost time.

31:57.984 --> 31:59.185
The Reaper should be
in position soon...

31:59.318 --> 32:01.120
Assistant Director Cooper?
Screen's up.

32:01.253 --> 32:04.923
<i>****</i>

32:05.057 --> 32:09.195
<i>****</i>

32:09.328 --> 32:11.663
That's Greeley's car.
He's en route
to the meeting point.

32:11.797 --> 32:13.699
How sure are we?
We have confirmation

32:13.832 --> 32:15.267
from cameras on the ground
in Ulaanbaatar.

32:15.401 --> 32:17.303
Centcom Command,
this is Ames,

32:17.436 --> 32:19.105
Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs.

32:19.238 --> 32:20.439
How long
to the target?

32:20.572 --> 32:21.773
Four mikes out.

32:21.907 --> 32:23.742
<i>We have an RQ-180</i>
conducting surveillance

32:23.875 --> 32:25.577
<i>and an MQ-9</i>
moving into position.

32:25.711 --> 32:28.080
Be advised, we will not
go weapons free

32:28.214 --> 32:30.649
<i>until we have a visual</i>
on the target and the buyer.

32:30.782 --> 32:31.984
<i>If someone's moving</i>
against us,

32:32.118 --> 32:33.952
<i>I want to know</i>
who the hell it is.

32:34.086 --> 32:35.187
Roger that.

32:35.321 --> 32:36.888
<i>Target appears to be</i>
arriving now.

32:38.424 --> 32:40.892
<i>Command,</i>
how close can you get us?

32:41.027 --> 32:42.228
Target confirmed.

32:42.361 --> 32:44.230
What do we know about
the surrounding buildings?

32:44.363 --> 32:46.398
We may have
a collateral-damage issue.

32:46.532 --> 32:49.301
<i>Unknown. We're working</i>
<i>to identify the occupants</i>
as we speak.

32:49.435 --> 32:51.737
Any strike needs
to happen outside.

32:51.870 --> 32:53.405
We are not killing civilians
or government workers.

32:53.539 --> 32:54.773
Stand by.

32:54.906 --> 32:57.309
Two unknown subjects
moving toward Greeley.

32:59.078 --> 33:00.679
Repositioning for visual.

33:00.812 --> 33:04.516
<i>****</i>

33:04.650 --> 33:08.154
<i>****</i>

33:08.287 --> 33:09.421
Oh, my God.

33:11.223 --> 33:12.824
Is that...

33:12.958 --> 33:14.260
Raymond Reddington.

33:16.262 --> 33:20.332
Mr. Greeley! Or Ogden.
Do you prefer Ogden?

33:20.466 --> 33:22.468
<i>Centcom Command,</i>
standing by.

33:22.601 --> 33:24.736
<i>We're in position, sir.</i>
Awaiting your orders.

33:29.108 --> 33:30.509
You can't do this.

33:30.642 --> 33:31.743
Say that again?

33:31.877 --> 33:33.679
Raymond Reddington
is a-a criminal.

33:33.812 --> 33:35.114
So?

33:35.247 --> 33:37.383
So the President's decision
to authorize this strike

33:37.516 --> 33:40.252
was clearly to protect
against a rival power,

33:40.386 --> 33:43.655
an enemy nation-state
intent on using
our technology against us.

33:43.789 --> 33:45.457
Reddington doesn't
have an army.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.093
He can't take
a military action.

33:47.226 --> 33:49.995
Maybe not, but he can sell it
to a country that can.

33:50.129 --> 33:51.863
I have to say,
Mr. Reddington,

33:51.997 --> 33:54.800
I never imagined
you could raise
this kind of capital.

33:54.933 --> 33:57.069
I'm rather surprised myself.

33:57.203 --> 33:59.571
Apparently, I have
a phenomenally high

33:59.705 --> 34:01.807
criminal credit score.

34:01.940 --> 34:04.843
Let's not talk here.
Why don't we move inside?

34:04.976 --> 34:07.679
There's a strong argument
that Reddington's presence

34:07.813 --> 34:09.615
fundamentally alters
our authorization to proceed.

34:09.748 --> 34:10.816
So we do nothing?

34:10.949 --> 34:12.684
We just let our most
sensitive intel

34:12.818 --> 34:15.654
fall into the hands
of the world's
most wanted fugitive?

34:15.787 --> 34:17.489
<i>General Ames, sir,</i>
they're on the move.

34:18.524 --> 34:19.758
<i>We need a decision, sir.</i>

34:19.891 --> 34:21.393
<i>They're moving</i>
out of our sight line.

34:22.561 --> 34:23.562
Damn it!

34:25.397 --> 34:26.998
Get the President
on the line. Now!

34:27.133 --> 34:29.701
<i>We have no clear shot.</i>
We've lost visual.

34:29.835 --> 34:31.437
Find them!

34:31.570 --> 34:33.839
<i>We have no assets</i>
on the ground, sir.

34:33.972 --> 34:35.807
<i>There's no way for us</i>
to track their movement.

34:35.941 --> 34:38.076
You just put every American
in danger.

34:38.210 --> 34:40.712
We'll find them, sir.
You have my word.

34:40.846 --> 34:42.848
We'll do everything
in our power
to bring them in.

34:42.981 --> 34:46.518
<i>****</i>

34:55.060 --> 34:56.762
The Black Budget.

34:56.895 --> 34:58.297
Here are the results
you were looking for.

34:59.498 --> 35:02.534
I know Reddington acquired
Greeley's intel.

35:02.668 --> 35:04.035
I could have prevented that
from happening,

35:04.170 --> 35:06.104
but it would have required
killing you both.

35:06.238 --> 35:09.275
<i>****</i>

35:09.408 --> 35:11.543
Are you wondering if you
made the right decision?

35:13.011 --> 35:14.012
How does he do it?

35:15.247 --> 35:16.548
Find out about things that are

35:17.883 --> 35:19.551
impossible to find out about?

35:20.986 --> 35:22.421
He is a resourceful man.

35:23.555 --> 35:25.056
You are a good one.

35:25.191 --> 35:27.559
Whatever's in there,
I hope it doesn't prevent you

35:27.693 --> 35:29.961
from accepting
the Governor's offer.

35:30.095 --> 35:31.963
This country needs
a man like you.

35:32.097 --> 35:39.070
<i>****</i>

35:39.205 --> 35:40.372
Director.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.641
Or should I say
Senator?

35:42.774 --> 35:44.543
Would you give us
a moment?

35:44.676 --> 35:46.545
Well, good news
enjoys company.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.146
Then you should definitely go.

35:48.280 --> 35:54.653
<i>****</i>

35:54.786 --> 35:55.754
What's this?

35:55.887 --> 35:57.756
The reason you wanted
my promise.

35:57.889 --> 35:59.291
And the reason
I can't give it.

36:00.459 --> 36:02.361
If you can't give it,
you won't be appointed.

36:02.494 --> 36:03.795
When no one can see
how money gets spent,

36:03.929 --> 36:05.364
it can get spent anywhere,

36:05.497 --> 36:07.599
including a no-bid,
$100-million contract

36:07.733 --> 36:09.935
to a company in which your son

36:10.068 --> 36:11.303
is a principal owner.

36:11.437 --> 36:13.439
My son?
This isn't about him.

36:13.572 --> 36:16.508
This is about you, using
public money for private gain.

36:18.076 --> 36:20.178
Whatever you think
you have here,

36:20.312 --> 36:23.715
you have because
you broke the law.

36:23.849 --> 36:26.952
Earmarks in the Black Budget
are classified.

36:27.085 --> 36:28.954
Is that a threat?
That's advice.

36:29.087 --> 36:32.157
Friendly advice that we forget
that we ever met,

36:32.291 --> 36:33.992
for your sake.

36:34.125 --> 36:36.228
I thought I had the right man
for the job, but clearly...

36:38.163 --> 36:39.298
I was mistaken.

36:39.431 --> 36:44.169
<i>****</i>

36:44.303 --> 36:49.341
<i>****</i>

36:49.475 --> 36:53.211
Warwick is a piece of gum
on the bottom of your shoe

36:53.345 --> 36:56.515
and the Senate a wind tunnel
of self-indulgence.

36:56.648 --> 36:59.418
What we do
is <i>far</i> more important.

37:02.120 --> 37:03.221
Here.

37:05.491 --> 37:07.259
The intel Greeley stole.

37:07.393 --> 37:10.028
Luckily, I turned out
to be the highest bidder.

37:10.161 --> 37:12.564
If your plan was to buy it,
why even give us the case?

37:12.698 --> 37:14.466
Oh, don't sell yourself short,
Harold.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.736
The Bureau, on occasion,
can be somewhat helpful.

37:17.869 --> 37:20.672
In this case,
as a re-sale market.

37:21.973 --> 37:23.509
You want to sell us
our own intel?

37:24.042 --> 37:25.210
Yes.

37:25.344 --> 37:26.678
For $200 million.

37:30.716 --> 37:32.751
175. Friends
and family discount.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.054
What did you pay for it?

37:36.988 --> 37:38.857
150.

37:38.990 --> 37:41.092
What's a small mark-up
between family and friends?

37:42.461 --> 37:44.396
I'll see if I can get you 155.

37:44.530 --> 37:46.665
For the intel and a thank you.

37:46.798 --> 37:49.034
<i>We knew Greeley was selling</i>
the intel in Mongolia.

37:49.167 --> 37:51.069
<i>To prevent it, I got</i>
the President to order

37:51.202 --> 37:54.239
<i>a drone strike on him and</i>
whoever he was selling to.

37:54.373 --> 37:56.875
You invoked the federal
Kill List?
Yes.

37:57.008 --> 37:58.610
And because you kept
your endgame secret,

37:58.744 --> 38:00.278
you were nearly vaporized.

38:01.580 --> 38:05.083
155 it is.
And I thank you.

38:07.052 --> 38:08.720
I'm sorry about the Senate.

38:10.422 --> 38:11.289
He was right.

38:12.658 --> 38:14.025
Because of
our relationship,

38:14.159 --> 38:17.095
Warwick assumed
I'd be morally ambiguous.

38:17.228 --> 38:18.296
He assumed wrong.

38:18.430 --> 38:20.966
Did he? I'm not so sure.

38:22.868 --> 38:24.570
You accept that
the world is gray.

38:24.703 --> 38:26.304
That's a virtue, not a vice.

38:27.906 --> 38:29.908
I know the Task Force
does good work.

38:30.041 --> 38:32.077
I know people like Greeley
are a threat to the country

38:32.210 --> 38:34.913
and we keep them
off the street.

38:35.046 --> 38:36.648
But then I think about
what else I do.

38:36.782 --> 38:39.418
Ordering a drone strike
on an American citizen

38:39.551 --> 38:41.453
without due process,

38:41.587 --> 38:43.922
not reporting Agent Keen's
criminal activities.

38:44.790 --> 38:47.459
You've taken
calculated risks

38:47.593 --> 38:49.495
which have been
amply rewarded.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.597
Whether that's true,
only time will tell.

38:52.297 --> 38:53.899
What I know now

38:54.032 --> 38:56.067
is that working with you
has changed me.

38:57.202 --> 38:58.970
It's changed all of us.

38:59.104 --> 39:01.640
None of us are the same people
we were when this began.

39:03.642 --> 39:05.444
I'm not the same, either.

39:06.812 --> 39:07.813
I'm better.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.782
I think
you're the reason why.

39:12.418 --> 39:14.386
You could've said yes
to Warwick,

39:14.520 --> 39:16.755
told him
you'd vote his way,

39:16.888 --> 39:20.091
then go back on your word
once you'd been sworn in.

39:21.460 --> 39:23.128
That's what some people
would've done.

39:23.261 --> 39:25.697
Hell, that's what most people
I know would have done.

39:25.831 --> 39:27.198
But not you, Harold.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.101
You could've made a promise

39:30.235 --> 39:32.738
that you never
intended to keep

39:32.871 --> 39:35.173
and become
a United States senator.

39:36.307 --> 39:37.275
But you didn't.

39:38.276 --> 39:40.846
Because your word
is your bond.

39:42.347 --> 39:44.082
<i>Very</i> few people
can say that.

39:48.319 --> 39:50.822
When you put it like that,

39:50.956 --> 39:52.824
I'm almost glad I didn't drop
a Reaper on your head.

39:55.861 --> 39:57.362
What will Charlene do
when you tell her

39:57.496 --> 39:58.830
you turned down Warwick?

39:59.965 --> 40:00.999
She'll be sad.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.401
For about 10 minutes.

40:03.535 --> 40:05.737
Then she'll shrug,
make some popcorn,

40:05.871 --> 40:08.339
and we'll fall asleep watching
an episode of <i>The Chi.</i>

40:09.541 --> 40:10.676
That's it?

40:11.342 --> 40:13.111
That's it.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.213
That's what
ordinary people do.

40:15.346 --> 40:16.381
You should try it sometime.

40:16.515 --> 40:17.749
An ordinary life.

40:18.684 --> 40:20.486
It's really
quite extraordinary.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.110
Raymond?

40:45.243 --> 40:47.746
<i>Anne.</i>
I am so terribly sorry.

40:47.879 --> 40:48.880
Is everything okay?

40:49.515 --> 40:51.216
No, it's not.

40:51.349 --> 40:52.718
It's work.

40:54.385 --> 40:56.688
I'm afraid I'm not going to
be able to make it tonight.

40:58.189 --> 40:59.290
Oh.

41:00.892 --> 41:01.893
Okay.

41:03.361 --> 41:04.996
It's not a big deal.

41:05.130 --> 41:08.567
Yes, it is.
I asked you to stay,
to change your plans.

41:08.700 --> 41:10.602
Raymond, don't worry.

41:10.736 --> 41:11.903
It's okay.

41:13.438 --> 41:14.906
I didn't change my plans.

41:15.941 --> 41:17.676
I just got home
a few hours ago.

41:19.711 --> 41:22.280
Oh. I see.

41:22.413 --> 41:27.553

41:27.686 --> 41:29.788
I had such a lovely time
together.

41:30.589 --> 41:31.823
Oh, I did, too.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.695
Perhaps we'll meet up
again sometime.

41:37.963 --> 41:39.130
In the park.

41:39.264 --> 41:42.868
I'll be sure to look
for that fox sparrow for you.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.002
<i>You do that.</i>

41:45.637 --> 41:47.005
Let me know
if you find him.

41:47.138 --> 41:47.973
<i>I will.</i>

41:51.042 --> 41:52.010
Goodbye, Anne.

41:54.746 --> 41:55.947
Goodbye.
