WEBVTT

00:03.235 --> 00:06.139
Come on, Regine, we gettin'
old down here, girl.

00:06.206 --> 00:07.340
Come on, now, you don't
wanna be late

00:07.407 --> 00:09.475
for your boyfriend's
first big art show.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.149
Oh, yes, I do.

00:16.216 --> 00:19.185
My entrance must be grand.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.288
Tonight, Keith and I
are making our debut

00:22.355 --> 00:24.290
in the art world
as a couple.

00:27.794 --> 00:30.330
I am his muse

00:30.396 --> 00:32.332
and I shan't disappoint.

00:33.567 --> 00:36.402
I don't know how
a muse is supposed to look

00:36.469 --> 00:40.040
but nothing's droopin',
fallin' out, or spillin' over.

00:40.106 --> 00:41.908
You look good to me,
girlie, let roll.

00:43.677 --> 00:45.579
Regine, tell Keith
I'm sorry, I can't make it

00:45.646 --> 00:48.782
but I gotta read five freelance
articles by tomorrow mornin'.

00:48.849 --> 00:51.685
Khadijah, you read
those last night.

00:51.752 --> 00:54.254
Alright, here's
the real reason.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.322
I just don't wanna go
to no corny‐ass art show.

00:58.158 --> 00:59.325
Well, forget you then

00:59.392 --> 01:01.467
you're not invited.

01:01.535 --> 01:03.670
‐ Oop.
‐ That's all you have to do?

01:08.274 --> 01:10.911
Lookie here, I‐I‐I really
don't wanna go either.

01:13.346 --> 01:15.448
[sighs]
We'll stop for ice‐cream
on the way back.

01:16.416 --> 01:17.918
[breathes heavy]

01:21.387 --> 01:22.322
Ooh.

01:28.161 --> 01:29.563
Hey, um, about the,
the ice‐cream, I was‐‐

01:29.630 --> 01:31.264

02:07.874 --> 02:10.376
I have done it yet again.

02:10.443 --> 02:12.779
You matched your socks
with your drawers in the dark.

02:14.881 --> 02:16.783
See if you can
stay with me, alright?

02:16.850 --> 02:18.918
The installation of that fire
hydrant in front of the building

02:18.985 --> 02:21.087
has made it
almost impossible to park.

02:21.154 --> 02:24.057
However, by using
my expert driving skills

02:24.124 --> 02:26.292
I managed
to bumper‐butt a Miata

02:26.359 --> 02:28.962
and secure the last parking
space on the block.

02:29.029 --> 02:31.031
Thank you.

02:31.097 --> 02:33.433
Excited about a parking space.

02:33.499 --> 02:35.101
You ain't got none
in a while, have you?

02:40.841 --> 02:42.876
You stole my parking space!

02:44.010 --> 02:45.278
Move your car!

02:50.416 --> 02:51.785
Maxine Shaw

02:51.852 --> 02:54.821
the only thing
I am going to move for you

02:54.888 --> 02:56.757
is a finger.

03:00.060 --> 03:02.569
Fine and dandy.

03:09.009 --> 03:11.277
Why am I filled
with such dread?

03:12.312 --> 03:13.279
Ooh‐hoo.

03:13.346 --> 03:15.148
Maybe 'cause it's
a couple hundred pigeons

03:15.215 --> 03:16.683
roosting on your car.

03:16.750 --> 03:19.419
My hand‐buffed
iridescent finish! Max!

03:19.485 --> 03:21.454
[Max laughing]

03:21.522 --> 03:24.257
Two bags of birdseed
and some ground‐up Ex‐Lax

03:24.324 --> 03:28.094
and you've got yourself
a party.

03:29.930 --> 03:30.864
Okay, now, let's see.

03:30.931 --> 03:32.933
When the door opens

03:32.999 --> 03:34.801
which leg should I extend

03:34.868 --> 03:36.803
for maximum impact?

03:38.471 --> 03:41.007
The left one. The right one
has a big ol' run in it.

03:49.415 --> 03:52.953
Oh, Regine!
That dress is fantastic.

03:53.019 --> 03:54.220
Oh. Yes.

03:54.287 --> 03:55.522
And it would really set off

03:55.589 --> 03:56.923
that painting
in the corner over there.

03:56.990 --> 03:58.324
Why don't you stand
next to it and see

03:58.391 --> 04:00.333
if you can attract
some buyers?

04:01.968 --> 04:04.004
‐ Mmm.
‐ 'Hmm..'

04:04.070 --> 04:06.006
What do you think
of this one, Obie?

04:09.209 --> 04:11.477
Friends don't let
friends paint drunk.

04:11.545 --> 04:12.846
Ohh.

04:14.748 --> 04:18.184
Uh.. Excuse me..

04:18.250 --> 04:22.756
...but, your breath
is frizzin' up my hair.

04:22.823 --> 04:25.258
Well, I just wanted
a close‐up of the

04:25.325 --> 04:28.795
loveliest piece of art
in the room.

04:29.896 --> 04:31.364
Ooh, and it talks too.

04:31.431 --> 04:33.933
[scoffs]
Yes, but I don't think
you want to hear

04:34.000 --> 04:35.935
what it has to say.

04:36.870 --> 04:37.837
I am drawn to you

04:37.904 --> 04:40.907
like a moth to a flame.

04:42.375 --> 04:43.710
Burn me, baby.

04:43.777 --> 04:47.313
‐ Tsss.
‐ Oh.

04:47.380 --> 04:50.150
Baby, that,
that man over there

04:50.216 --> 04:51.852
just put his hands on me.

04:53.353 --> 04:55.689
That's Carvin Edmonds
from the "Soho Sentinel."

04:55.756 --> 04:58.525
Did he happened to say
anything about my paintings?

04:58.592 --> 05:00.393
It's more important
to you to get a good review

05:00.460 --> 05:03.069
than to defend
my honor?

05:03.136 --> 05:05.338
Well, wouldn't you be honored
if I got a good review?

05:07.974 --> 05:08.942
[sighs]

05:12.478 --> 05:13.580
[indistinct whispering]

05:15.281 --> 05:18.418
Not with a ten‐foot pole,
a wetsuit

05:18.484 --> 05:20.353
and a case of disinfectant.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.724
You heard the lady.

05:23.790 --> 05:26.560
Leave before you're tastin'
a mouthful of Jamaican fist.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.231
Do you know
who you're talking to?

05:31.297 --> 05:34.134
Yes. Carvin Edmonds.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.202
A man who has made
a career out of the phrase

05:36.269 --> 05:38.204
(as Carvin)
"I don't get it."

05:40.206 --> 05:43.443
And lookin' at you,
I can see why you don't.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.414
Move it!

05:48.481 --> 05:51.585
Russell, thank you.

05:51.652 --> 05:54.655
Wow, who woulda thought
my knight in shining armor

05:54.721 --> 05:56.422
would be wearing
a knit cap

05:56.489 --> 05:58.625
and a Peter Tosh pinky ring?

06:00.193 --> 06:01.234
No problem.

06:01.301 --> 06:02.636
Yaka‐mouths like him make

06:02.703 --> 06:05.305
gentlemen like myself
look bad.

06:05.371 --> 06:08.575
May I say you're lookin'
wonderful tonight.

06:08.642 --> 06:10.644
Piqued, pouty,
and protruding.

06:15.649 --> 06:18.585
Khadijah, is Overton back yet?

06:18.652 --> 06:20.220
I've worn out my chamois

06:20.286 --> 06:22.055
getting bird‐droppings
off my car

06:22.122 --> 06:23.724
and I'm out
of guano‐be‐gone‐o.

06:26.126 --> 06:27.828
Well, hey,
how was the art show?

06:27.894 --> 06:31.331
Oh, I think Keith's paintings
really say something.

06:31.397 --> 06:33.266
Yeah, judging
by those prices

06:33.333 --> 06:37.237
it was sayin',
"Hello, sucker."

06:37.303 --> 06:40.641
Well, I built
my very own ice‐cream buffet

06:40.707 --> 06:42.709
and now I'm sick and happy.

06:43.944 --> 06:45.245
I'm just happy.

06:46.713 --> 06:49.616
Yeah, well, I'm glad somebody's
evening wasn't ruined.

06:50.250 --> 06:52.252
Ooh‐ooh!

06:52.318 --> 06:55.255
Look at that big ol' run.

06:55.321 --> 06:57.524
Mm! That's what you get when you
put pantyhose on a cactus.

07:03.637 --> 07:07.273
There I was,
wearing my fabulous dress

07:07.340 --> 07:09.475
wearing my formal hair

07:09.543 --> 07:12.012
and do you think
Keith noticed me?

07:12.078 --> 07:14.180
I'm galled. Why would Keith
go to all the trouble

07:14.247 --> 07:15.916
of painting for months
printing up invitations

07:15.982 --> 07:17.584
inviting all those people
not to spend

07:17.651 --> 07:20.320
the whole evening
focused on you?

07:22.723 --> 07:23.824
I'm sayin'.

07:25.091 --> 07:26.259
Come on, Regine.

07:26.326 --> 07:28.629
You got to let the brother
handle his business.

07:28.695 --> 07:31.732
You think Noah's wife
was bothering him by sayin'

07:31.798 --> 07:34.701
"Forget that ark,
what about my needs?"

07:36.770 --> 07:38.438
No, Obie,
it's not just that.

07:38.505 --> 07:40.006
Keith didn't even
come to my rescue

07:40.073 --> 07:42.943
when some brother
was pushin' up on me.

07:43.009 --> 07:44.778
Well, Regine, I saw
Keith whispering

07:44.845 --> 07:46.412
something intimate
in your ear.

07:46.479 --> 07:49.716
He was asking me to change
the bulb in the bathroom.

07:49.783 --> 07:52.418
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

07:52.485 --> 07:55.188
to stand on a toilet,
in high heels

07:55.255 --> 07:58.158
with one arm up
in the air?

07:58.224 --> 08:00.701
Try it
on an airplane. Whoo.

08:04.738 --> 08:06.873
This isn't the first time
I felt like me and Keith

08:06.940 --> 08:09.242
just weren't
on the same page.

08:09.309 --> 08:11.878
I mean, have any of you
noticed that he can be..

08:13.013 --> 08:14.548
‐ I don't know.
‐ Aloof?

08:14.615 --> 08:15.916
‐ Distant?
‐ <i>Blase.</i>

08:15.982 --> 08:17.918
‐ Zombie‐like?
‐ Dull as a box of rocks?

08:17.984 --> 08:19.385
[laughter]

08:19.452 --> 08:21.988
Oh, that was fun!
Let's do it again. Go!

08:22.055 --> 08:23.189
‐ Aloof.
‐ Distant.

08:23.256 --> 08:24.725
‐ Blase.
‐ Zombie‐like.

08:24.791 --> 08:26.760
Dull as a box of rocks.

08:26.827 --> 08:27.761
[all laughing]

08:29.596 --> 08:30.997
For real, though, Regine

08:31.064 --> 08:32.765
I mean, maybe
Keith doesn't realize

08:32.832 --> 08:34.333
he's comin' off
like a stiff.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.736
‐ Talk to him.
‐ Alright, I will.

08:36.803 --> 08:39.304
But I'm going over there now.
I can't wait till tomorrow.

08:39.371 --> 08:40.874
Tomorrow?

08:40.941 --> 08:42.775
Alternate‐side‐of‐the‐street
parking in effect.

08:42.842 --> 08:44.778
Move your car or get a ticket.
Tough luck, loser!

08:44.845 --> 08:45.946
[laughing]

08:47.147 --> 08:48.448
[door shuts]

08:48.515 --> 08:50.751
Now, don't you wanna beat her
to the parking space?

08:50.817 --> 08:51.985
No, I got some time.

08:52.052 --> 08:53.186
It'll take at least
half an hour

08:53.253 --> 08:54.621
to put the air back
in her tires.

08:54.688 --> 08:57.257
[laughing]

08:57.323 --> 09:00.567
I don't know, bro.
Baby drivin' on the rims, man.

09:00.634 --> 09:02.569
Oh, no! What?

09:05.071 --> 09:08.575
Baby, here's to you
for all your help tonight.

09:08.642 --> 09:11.211
Oh, good looking out
on that light bulb situation.

09:12.979 --> 09:14.414
You now, Keith,
to be honest

09:14.480 --> 09:17.117
um, I had a terrible
time tonight.

09:17.183 --> 09:19.786
Baby, you hardly paid
any attention to me

09:19.853 --> 09:21.988
until Enrico went home sick
and then you needed me

09:22.055 --> 09:23.990
to help out
with valet parking.

09:25.091 --> 09:26.392
I'm sorry.

09:26.459 --> 09:28.995
From now on if you don't wanna
come to the openings, it's cool.

09:31.832 --> 09:33.333
So, what,
it's okay with you

09:33.399 --> 09:34.935
if I don't
share some of

09:35.001 --> 09:37.437
some of the most important
events of your life?

09:37.504 --> 09:38.839
I just don't wanna ask you
to do something

09:38.905 --> 09:41.107
that you don't
wanna do, that's all.

09:41.174 --> 09:42.709
I mean, that would just
work your nerves.

09:42.776 --> 09:44.578
Well, work my nerves!

09:44.645 --> 09:48.181
Damn, just work somethin' that
let's me know you have a pulse!

09:49.750 --> 09:52.052
Baby, the only time you ever
showed any passion

09:52.118 --> 09:55.388
is when you're painting
or, or when we're having sex.

09:55.455 --> 09:57.991
Oh, you wanna have sex.

09:58.058 --> 09:59.793
Come on, baby.

09:59.860 --> 10:02.536
I don't want to have sex.

10:03.469 --> 10:06.239
I want a relationship.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.344
Ah.. Wha..

10:11.411 --> 10:14.014
You know, this is,
this is not workin' for me.

10:15.549 --> 10:17.283
Wow.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.152
I thought we were cool.

10:20.186 --> 10:22.122
Sure a little sex
won't help?

10:23.223 --> 10:25.759
I don't wanna have sex,
you rock head!

10:28.128 --> 10:29.863
Baby, do you realize
that I'm ready

10:29.930 --> 10:31.865
to just walk out on you?

10:34.568 --> 10:35.669
Well..

10:37.538 --> 10:39.573
I gue.. If you can't
hang with me the way I am

10:39.640 --> 10:42.275
I guess you gotta do
what you gotta do.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.948
[scoffs]
Oh, that's it?

10:48.014 --> 10:51.217
You.. You're not even
gonna fight for me?

10:53.654 --> 10:55.956
Well, either you wanna
be with me or you don't.

10:57.123 --> 10:58.525
It's on you.

11:03.003 --> 11:04.938
I'm on the elevator.

11:07.608 --> 11:08.642
Regine.

11:09.910 --> 11:11.945
I guess there's
nothing left to say except

11:12.012 --> 11:13.947
I hope we can be friends.

11:17.951 --> 11:19.219
We can, Keith..

11:21.054 --> 11:22.589
...but not with each other.

11:32.833 --> 11:36.903
Regine, sorry to see you lookin'
so down in the mouth

11:36.970 --> 11:39.339
though I'm glad you're
still big in the blouse.

11:41.141 --> 11:42.809
Russell, not now, alright?

11:42.876 --> 11:44.611
Keith and I
just broke up.

11:44.678 --> 11:46.312
Ah.

11:46.379 --> 11:49.315
Well, as they say
on my island

11:49.382 --> 11:51.885
"Sometimes the queen bee
has to fly past

11:51.952 --> 11:53.620
"the manicured gardens

11:53.687 --> 11:56.422
into the deep wild woods
to find the sweetest nectar."

11:58.358 --> 11:59.793
That's beautiful.

11:59.860 --> 12:01.768
They must be
very wise in Jamaica?

12:01.835 --> 12:04.204
Yes, and they also
have a lot of bees.

12:06.607 --> 12:08.975
Look, Regine, I'm gonna
have to cancel lunch.

12:09.042 --> 12:10.276
The printer
accidentally swapped

12:10.343 --> 12:12.846
our cover
with "Black Brides" magazine.

12:12.913 --> 12:14.515
Our readers don't wanna
see Dennis Rodman

12:14.581 --> 12:16.049
wearin' his mother's
wedding dress.

12:17.283 --> 12:18.418
Oh, this is just great.

12:18.484 --> 12:19.920
My, my heart gets broken

12:19.986 --> 12:22.422
my roommate dumps me.

12:22.488 --> 12:24.591
Only thing to do,
head to the city

12:24.658 --> 12:26.993
and shop till they name
a sale after me.

12:28.028 --> 12:30.396
I'm city‐bound.
I'll give you a ride.

12:30.463 --> 12:31.765
No, thank you,
I make it a point

12:31.832 --> 12:34.100
never to ride
in Day‐Glo Volkswagens.

12:35.368 --> 12:36.770
Suit yourself

12:36.837 --> 12:39.272
but you'll never get
a cab during lunchtime.

12:39.339 --> 12:42.809
And I'm sure you don't want
to face the midday pungence

12:42.876 --> 12:45.311
of the late summer subway.

12:45.378 --> 12:46.747
Alright, I'll ride with you

12:46.813 --> 12:50.083
but only if you promise
to get me there un‐fondled.

12:51.785 --> 12:54.888
You have my word of honor.
I'll keep my hands to myself.

12:55.822 --> 12:57.691
Of course, on sharp corners

12:57.758 --> 12:59.693
God knows where my head
will end up.

13:02.302 --> 13:03.770
‐ Russell, wha..
‐ No, no.

13:03.837 --> 13:05.772
Russell, you promised me
that you would take me

13:05.839 --> 13:07.073
straight to the boutique.

13:07.140 --> 13:09.876
No, I promised
I wouldn't fondle you.

13:09.943 --> 13:12.078
When those potholes
made you bounce

13:12.145 --> 13:14.280
ooh, that was no small order.

13:15.248 --> 13:16.883
Come, let's enjoy our lunch

13:16.950 --> 13:18.652
at this nice Jamaican
family restaurant.

13:18.719 --> 13:19.886
Russell, I don't want..
I'm not‐‐

13:19.953 --> 13:21.822
‐ Come sit, now, wait..
‐ Ah!

13:21.888 --> 13:23.657
I see you brought
a feisty one

13:23.724 --> 13:25.792
this time, nephew.

13:25.859 --> 13:27.628
Nephew?

13:27.694 --> 13:29.495
Oh, well, that explains

13:29.563 --> 13:32.999
why your five wedding pictures
are taped to the refrigerator.

13:33.066 --> 13:34.835
‐ I'm out.
‐ Oh, no, you're not.

13:34.901 --> 13:37.137
You're gonna stay right here
until I cheer you up.

13:37.203 --> 13:40.406
Now, you always brighten
my day with your sweet face

13:40.473 --> 13:43.644
cranky disposition,
and well, you know.

13:43.710 --> 13:46.279
[chuckles]
So let's stay for lunch.

13:46.346 --> 13:49.716
Russell, I am very, very
particular about what I eat.

13:50.851 --> 13:53.319
Ooh, spinach patties.

13:53.386 --> 13:54.888
Could I please have
some hot sauce?

13:54.955 --> 13:56.456
Ah.

13:56.523 --> 13:58.625
Manners.

13:58.692 --> 14:01.502
She a lot nicer than the one
you brought for breakfast.

14:01.568 --> 14:04.304
[laughing]

14:04.370 --> 14:06.840
She must have me confused
with another nephew.

14:06.907 --> 14:08.675
[laughing]

14:09.510 --> 14:11.878
(Regine)
Whoo! Ah!

14:11.945 --> 14:14.414
The was the best rice and peas
I ever tasted.

14:14.480 --> 14:16.249
Oh!

14:16.316 --> 14:18.685
I really appreciate
you bringing me here.

14:18.752 --> 14:20.787
Just trying to be
a good friend.

14:20.854 --> 14:23.356
Well, a good friend
and a good meal was just

14:23.423 --> 14:26.259
what I needed
to lift my spirits.

14:26.326 --> 14:28.895
Perhaps it's time to burn off
some of those calories, eh?

14:30.631 --> 14:33.600
‐ Don't go there, Russell.
‐ What?

14:33.667 --> 14:35.301
There's a stair‐climber
in the next room.

14:35.368 --> 14:37.604
[chuckles]
Oh, okay, I'm..

14:37.671 --> 14:40.674
‐ I'm sorry, I misunderstood.
‐ That's okay.

14:40.741 --> 14:43.043
Now let's strip down
and do some high‐steppin'.

14:44.310 --> 14:45.812
Forget it, Russell.

14:45.879 --> 14:48.749
You are hardly my Mr. Right.

14:48.815 --> 14:51.017
But I am Mr. Right Here
and Right Now.

Come. Let's dance.

Ohh!

Maxine, move your bumper.
I was here first.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.188
Well, I'm here now.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.724
There's plenty of parking
in Connecticut!

15:57.791 --> 15:59.993
Then I suggest that
you go there

16:00.060 --> 16:02.903
because this space is mine.

16:02.969 --> 16:05.105
Why can't you just
get out of my way?

16:12.779 --> 16:14.447
Don't go there.
Don't go below the belt.

16:14.515 --> 16:15.448
You were never
very good there.

16:15.516 --> 16:16.983
Oh.. Hm.

16:18.118 --> 16:19.485
Okay.

16:19.553 --> 16:22.556
This, this is ridiculous.

16:22.623 --> 16:25.626
So, why don't we both
just drive on

16:25.692 --> 16:28.729
and let someone else
have the space, huh?

16:29.663 --> 16:32.132
Finally, a rational thought.

"Wham Bam Keep That Man."

17:27.761 --> 17:30.531
"Is He A Soulmate

17:31.698 --> 17:34.034
See, these books
help you prioritize

17:34.100 --> 17:35.802
the qualities
that you want in a mate.

17:35.869 --> 17:38.304
Well, I did that.
I mean, take Keith for example.

17:38.371 --> 17:41.742
He was talented,
fine, successful.

17:41.808 --> 17:43.309
Brother was fine.

17:43.376 --> 17:45.912
And yet, more fine.

17:45.979 --> 17:48.148
But that wasn't enough.

17:48.214 --> 17:50.851
I want somebody
who's into me

17:50.917 --> 17:53.319
and who looks at life
as an adventure.

17:53.386 --> 17:57.090
And he's gotta be grounded
in a deep spirituality.

17:57.157 --> 17:59.793
And it wouldn't hurt
if he kisses like Russell.

18:02.903 --> 18:04.605
I know what you mean, girl.

18:04.671 --> 18:08.341
There ain't nothing
like a pair of big, juicy..

18:08.408 --> 18:09.510
Russell?

18:11.712 --> 18:14.681
That's why he came back
for lunch doin' the Macarena.

18:15.949 --> 18:17.350
Please. Russell kissed me
weeks ago.

18:17.417 --> 18:19.285
I don't even know
why I brought it up

18:19.352 --> 18:21.387
except to remember
to put it on my list.

18:21.454 --> 18:23.389
Here.
What you think?

18:29.596 --> 18:31.532
Girl, you ain't never gonna find
a man who's got all that.

18:31.598 --> 18:33.534
You gonna have to build one.

18:34.835 --> 18:36.570
Hey, if I have to.

18:36.637 --> 18:39.540
Khadijah, I have decided, girl,
the last thing I wanna do

18:39.606 --> 18:42.509
is to come home every night
to an empty bed

18:42.576 --> 18:45.045

but a big stack of work.
