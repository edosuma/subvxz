Beats By Dre, Ј199.

00:06.020 --> 00:08.219
Abo & Fitch,

00:08.220 --> 00:11.859
Ј79.95.

00:11.860 --> 00:14.259
SHB Vehicle Hire,

00:14.260 --> 00:17.059
Ј69.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.579
That's actually bloody decent
for a quad bike rental.

00:19.580 --> 00:22.579
Jack Wills...

00:22.580 --> 00:24.819
Now, please can you just understand

00:24.820 --> 00:28.820
that this was
for an entire winter look.

00:28.860 --> 00:32.819
...Ј467.55.

00:32.820 --> 00:34.419
The Sock Factory...

00:34.420 --> 00:37.899
That's the name of a website, not
an actual factory that I bought...

00:37.900 --> 00:41.499
Enough. Seriously.
Before I puke up my cheesy frites.

00:41.500 --> 00:44.579
I set you up for an interview
with Magda at Jonty Bonty

00:44.580 --> 00:46.099
and you do what?

00:46.100 --> 00:47.899
I fucked it.

00:47.900 --> 00:51.900
Yeah. You fucked it.
In all available holes.

00:52.220 --> 00:55.419
Fanny, mouth, arse and a bollock
up each nostril.

00:55.420 --> 00:58.979
- I tried. Really hard...
- No, I know what you did Jonathan.

00:58.980 --> 01:02.980
I wasn't born Tuesday,
AKA yesterday.

01:03.460 --> 01:06.819
Well - that is it.
I'm disconnecting the pipe.

01:06.820 --> 01:08.139
What pipe?

01:08.140 --> 01:10.499
The money pipe, Jonathan.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.499
I've sorted you a job.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.739
Junior position, shit pay.

01:14.740 --> 01:18.740
Until you accept,
you are officially cut off.

01:55.580 --> 01:58.659
- Oregon?
- Oh, I'm just, erm, burning some poems.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.539
Right. The, er, competition.

02:00.540 --> 02:04.259
Yeah. Bit of a "poetry
surplus" scenario.

02:04.260 --> 02:08.098
But I mean, you have read them
all, though?

02:08.100 --> 02:11.059
I've read them. Yeah.

02:11.060 --> 02:12.979
I've nearly read most of
these poems.

02:12.980 --> 02:16.099
Do you think that you should
maybe... come clean?

02:16.100 --> 02:17.299
Come clean about what?

02:17.300 --> 02:21.300
- Taking 20 grand and wasting it
on a poetry prize.
- It's not wasted!

02:21.580 --> 02:24.499
Arts. Legacy.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.739
Patronage.

02:26.740 --> 02:28.739
It's OK.

02:28.740 --> 02:32.740
Everything's basically
going to be OK.

02:33.180 --> 02:35.659
Right. Back to the bonfire!

02:35.660 --> 02:39.660
- I'll get marshmallows!
- OK.

02:55.860 --> 02:58.339
I make that precisely Bonk o'...

02:58.340 --> 03:00.339
...clock.

03:00.340 --> 03:03.099
Oh, God.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.059
Oh. Hello?

03:05.060 --> 03:09.060
- Sorry...
- No! No, God, I'M sorry,
I... I should've knocked.

03:10.940 --> 03:14.940
Erm... But this is great.
Erm, you two just crack on.

03:14.980 --> 03:17.059
Give him a... bloody good bonking,

03:17.060 --> 03:21.060
and I... I shall take my leave!

03:26.260 --> 03:28.819
He's a clever, clever bastard.

03:28.820 --> 03:31.459
He's isolated my one weakness.

03:31.460 --> 03:33.339
Poverty.

03:33.340 --> 03:35.619
Poverty is like my Kryptonite.

03:35.620 --> 03:38.379
I think poverty is everyone's
Kryptonite, JP.

03:38.380 --> 03:41.419
You know what? It's fine,
I can do it.

03:41.420 --> 03:44.499
I can live on the breadline.
It'll be fucking fun!

03:44.500 --> 03:47.419
Shopping around for deals,
using vouchers for Prezzo.

03:47.420 --> 03:50.899
Oh, yeah. I mean, if you get really
strapped you could always

03:50.900 --> 03:54.699
sell your collection of antique
Edwardian nutcrackers.

03:54.700 --> 03:58.700
Yes, Vod. Or, we could bring out
our mutual friend, Cunty Landlord.

03:58.900 --> 04:01.219
"Oh. Hello, Cunty, how are
you today?"

04:01.220 --> 04:04.619
"I'm fine, thank you,
JP. Has Vod paid her rent this week?"

04:04.620 --> 04:06.819
"No. She hasn't, Cunty."

04:06.820 --> 04:08.459
All right. Easy.

04:08.460 --> 04:11.579
Got more angry paper.

04:11.580 --> 04:15.580
It's so red. So angry.

04:16.899 --> 04:20.019
Oggs. More poetry for you.

04:20.019 --> 04:22.299
Right. I'll get the wheelbarrow.

04:22.300 --> 04:26.300
It just all seems a bit... indulgent,
a bit... braggy.

04:26.540 --> 04:28.619
- A bit "Look at me."
- Howard, it's a CV, mate.

04:28.620 --> 04:30.419
It's supposed to be a BIT
"Look at me."

04:30.420 --> 04:31.899
I don't like to boast.

04:31.900 --> 04:34.099
I'm small-headed.
Though ironically

04:34.100 --> 04:36.619
when it comes to helmet rental
I always come up large.

04:36.620 --> 04:38.579
It's Ordnance Survey. OK.

04:38.580 --> 04:42.580
They've probably got 28,000
candidates for that one position.

04:42.860 --> 04:45.339
Oh - quick warning,
I've got Bad-Soc this afternoon

04:45.340 --> 04:47.819
so don't expect any sense
out of me tonight!

04:47.820 --> 04:51.739
Ooh... Badminton. The last
refuge of the fucking loser.

04:51.740 --> 04:54.619
Mind your backs.

04:54.620 --> 04:58.499
Er, Vod. This isn't Badminton,
this is Radminton.

04:58.500 --> 04:59.859
More like... Sadminton.

04:59.860 --> 05:01.619
More like Madminton.

05:01.620 --> 05:05.620
Last week, we ended up doing
vodka shots out of a shuttlecock.

05:06.380 --> 05:08.539
- Shuttlecocks have got holes in them?
- Exactly!

05:08.540 --> 05:10.259
Cos that's how fucking mad we are.

05:10.260 --> 05:13.419
So... yeah, I'm pretty much set up
for friends next year.

05:13.420 --> 05:17.420
Game, set and trashed.

05:20.300 --> 05:24.300
It's from Fulbright. The scholarship
people. That's going to be me, Vod.

05:25.060 --> 05:28.339
Stroking books and just... laughing.

05:28.340 --> 05:29.619
Great.

05:29.620 --> 05:33.620
Professor Dumblefuck's International
School of Book-Stroking.

05:36.620 --> 05:39.059
Hmm...

05:39.060 --> 05:43.060
I think I may sell these
nutcrackers after all.

05:47.460 --> 05:49.339
How's the novella?

05:49.340 --> 05:52.059
It's a novel.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.939
Course it is.

05:53.940 --> 05:57.019
Well... thanks for pitching in
with the reading.

05:57.020 --> 05:58.419
Pleasure.

05:58.420 --> 06:01.179
And thus did
I decamp to fair Buxton,

06:01.180 --> 06:03.579
and therein did immerse
myself in verse.

06:03.580 --> 06:04.899
The majority of which,

06:04.900 --> 06:08.900
sorry to conjure, were
read in a Radox-filled bubble bath.

06:09.060 --> 06:11.299
- What's this?
- Those are my receipts, Oregon.

06:11.300 --> 06:13.939
That you very kindly offered to
cover in lieu of my standard

06:13.940 --> 06:17.940
reader's fee.
- Three grand?!

06:18.780 --> 06:20.899
Johnnie Walker?

06:20.900 --> 06:23.059
Turbot?

06:23.060 --> 06:24.779
What the fuck is a Belvedere?

06:24.780 --> 06:28.019
It's a type of cigar.

06:28.020 --> 06:30.939
Is that a new cardie?

06:30.940 --> 06:32.539
Have you had your teeth whitened?

06:32.540 --> 06:35.299
Oregon, that is an
outrageous accusation,

06:35.300 --> 06:38.099
that really is from the
bottom drawer.

06:38.100 --> 06:41.699
How am I supposed to get three grand
of turbot past accounts?

06:41.700 --> 06:43.899
This thing is spiralling.

06:43.900 --> 06:47.900
Oregon, if you're struggling,
just reach out and ask for help.

06:50.340 --> 06:53.299
No, it's fine. I can bury it.

06:53.300 --> 06:56.499
These... will not be a problem.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.739
I can just make the necessary...

06:58.740 --> 07:00.979
adjustments to the budget.

07:00.980 --> 07:04.779
Everything will be...

07:04.780 --> 07:08.780
Those are new fucking shoes, Tony.
I can see the soles!

07:13.700 --> 07:16.139
Have you seen where they're holding
the Graduation Ball?

07:16.140 --> 07:17.899
Fucking Distractions!

07:17.900 --> 07:19.299
Oh... I like Distractions.

07:19.300 --> 07:20.619
It's a worm-pit.

07:20.620 --> 07:23.979
It's basically a portal to hell
with a chewy toothbrush dispenser.

07:23.980 --> 07:27.980
The DJ wears a funny wig.
It is a solid night out.

07:29.980 --> 07:33.980
It was like a green quiff,
if you can imagine such a thing.

07:34.580 --> 07:38.379
I mean, why not go all out and hold
it in the fucking Wild Bean Cafe?!

07:38.380 --> 07:39.779
That's not as mad as it sounds.

07:39.780 --> 07:42.219
If you don't like it, why don't
YOU sort something, Kingo?

07:42.220 --> 07:44.819
Oh, yeah, Vod -
I'll sort something out.

07:44.820 --> 07:46.619
Cos that's the sort of thing
that happens.

07:46.620 --> 07:47.899
"Oh, let's have a party.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.419
"What sort of records
will I play at my party?

07:50.420 --> 07:52.259
"Where will all the people
put their coats?

07:52.260 --> 07:55.059
"Or should I just put all
the coats in a big bag?"

07:55.060 --> 07:59.019
Wake up, Vod, fuck's sake. Huh?

07:59.020 --> 08:03.020
Alternative Grad Ball.
Think about it.

08:03.420 --> 08:05.859
So... I have a first draft.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.299
My CV.

08:07.300 --> 08:11.300
The life and times
of Howard Redacted MacGregor.

08:11.740 --> 08:14.819
The first thing you'll notice
is the impeccable formatting.

08:14.820 --> 08:17.739
And then almost immediately your eye
will be drawn to a jarring blend

08:17.740 --> 08:20.739
blend of fonts -
Avenir Medium for the body

08:20.740 --> 08:23.459
and Franklin Gothic Bold
for the headers.

08:23.460 --> 08:27.460
A kind of niggling disparity
which wills you to look away but

08:27.780 --> 08:29.539
of course, you cannot.

08:29.540 --> 08:32.139
- Instep?
- Blood group?

08:32.140 --> 08:34.899
- Potted dental history?
- Oh - can I see that?

08:34.900 --> 08:37.019
Hobbies and interests, N/A?

08:37.020 --> 08:38.979
Not applicable.

08:38.980 --> 08:41.899
I did not know that
about your premolars.

08:41.900 --> 08:44.139
You need interests, Howard.
Just put anything.

08:44.140 --> 08:46.739
- I could put vintage Japanese erotica.
- Yeah, don't put that.

08:46.740 --> 08:48.739
Even your teeth make you
sound weird.

08:48.740 --> 08:50.539
Just make something up, Howard. Lie.

08:50.540 --> 08:54.540
Well... I'm off to "Lee Dull"...?

08:56.100 --> 08:58.019
Lie-Dull?

08:58.020 --> 09:02.020
The horrible place
with the free food.

09:04.700 --> 09:08.659
Josie... I'm a bit confused,

09:08.660 --> 09:11.699
Do you think maybe we could have
a little chat about our trade agreement?

09:11.700 --> 09:15.299
Re. er, docking at Smuggler's Cove.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.819
Probably my least favourite
vagina euphemism.

09:17.820 --> 09:19.699
So, just to clarify -

09:19.700 --> 09:22.979
erm, I am... still free to, er,

09:22.980 --> 09:25.859
trade my bananas with other
interested regions?

09:25.860 --> 09:27.339
No, JP.

09:27.340 --> 09:29.099
Because I'm so in love with you.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.699
"Oh, Josie loves JP!

09:30.700 --> 09:32.899
"Maybe she should get him
a Valentine's card!"

09:32.900 --> 09:35.019
Basically, I wouldn't be that upset
if you died -

09:35.020 --> 09:38.579
- I mean, I'd be sad, but I'd rally
pretty bloody quickly.

09:38.580 --> 09:42.139
So... yeah, maybe we should just
forget the whole thing.

09:42.140 --> 09:45.499
Oh. Fine, yeah, I mean... you know.
If that's what you want?

09:45.500 --> 09:49.500
Well, that way you don't have to
worry about me barging in on you
when you're balls-deep.

09:49.740 --> 09:53.499
- Do you really want to
know what this is?
- Yes.

09:53.500 --> 09:56.739
It's a fuck-fest free-for-all,
and we're just two horny atoms

09:56.740 --> 10:00.740
who keep... accidentally
smashing into each other. Capiche?

10:01.180 --> 10:03.699
Yeah. Capiche.

10:03.700 --> 10:05.659
I'm really glad we cleared that up.

10:05.660 --> 10:09.660
Good. Now I'm cocking off.
For now - we badminton!

10:43.420 --> 10:47.420
Shuttlecock shot!

10:47.580 --> 10:49.659
Ohhhh!

10:49.660 --> 10:53.659
We only need 15 more and then
we can move for impeachment.

10:53.660 --> 10:57.219
It's a petition. To have Oregon
Shawcross kicked out of office.

10:57.220 --> 10:59.499
Yeah, sorry. I can't sign this.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.459
Erm, she's actually
a friend of mine.

11:01.460 --> 11:04.459
She's running this union
into the ground.

11:04.460 --> 11:08.460
Slashing resources and jizzing away
God-knows-how much on her thing.

11:08.860 --> 11:12.539
Think you better go.

11:12.540 --> 11:14.099
Dale?

11:14.100 --> 11:18.100
Guys... Seriously?
You want me to go?

11:20.060 --> 11:24.060
I'm Jumping Josie Jones.
The mad slag of Bad-Soc.

11:24.620 --> 11:27.219
I just don't think that you'd be
particularly comfortable,

11:27.220 --> 11:30.859
with the kind of activism
WE'VE got in mind.

11:30.860 --> 11:32.539
Like what?

11:32.540 --> 11:36.540
We are going to burn an effigy
of Oregon in the quad.

11:36.660 --> 11:39.699
Wow. OK, yeah. Erm...

11:39.700 --> 11:43.700
first off can I just say,
and this didn't come from me...

11:44.620 --> 11:47.059
Burn the witch, burn the witch,
burn the witch!

11:47.060 --> 11:50.539
Erm... I'm just joking obviously,
she is a really great friend but...

11:50.540 --> 11:52.539
Y'know, any information you could
give us...

11:52.540 --> 11:54.743
would be really appreciated.

11:59.670 --> 12:02.709
So, I've been thinking about this
Alternative Grad Ball.

12:02.710 --> 12:05.069
I think it could look pretty
good on the old CV.

12:05.070 --> 12:09.070
Plus, bit of a cheeky middle digit
up to those goons at 6Music.

12:09.550 --> 12:12.389
My first question as a punter is,
will it be boring?

12:12.390 --> 12:15.389
Why would it be boring?

12:15.390 --> 12:17.229
I do need your help.

12:17.230 --> 12:21.230
You've got 60 seconds then
I must get back to the books.

12:22.270 --> 12:23.749
Right. Theme?

12:23.750 --> 12:26.269
Oh, erm, Carnevale di Venezia.

12:26.270 --> 12:29.949
- So, Carnival of Venice. A masked ball.
- So an orgy?

12:29.950 --> 12:33.469
Not an orgy. Like a warehouse party,
but in a marquee?

12:33.470 --> 12:34.869
Italian Hard House.

12:34.870 --> 12:38.269
You know, like a rave but, erm,
sort of with cheese?

12:38.270 --> 12:42.270
A classy masked rave in a large
tent, with loads of cheese?

12:42.390 --> 12:44.789
Right, let's talk toilets.

12:44.790 --> 12:48.790
One unit per ten females, er,
trough-style urinals for the blokes.

12:49.350 --> 12:51.949
Speak to the farmer whose
field it is, he'll, er,

12:51.950 --> 12:55.069
let you dump your turds in his silo
and that way you'll save on pumpage.

12:55.070 --> 12:58.029
- Next?
- Um...

12:58.030 --> 13:01.589
So, erm, yeah, er,
so in terms of types of cheese,

13:01.590 --> 13:04.869
I was thinking, erm, Grana Padano
and Pecorino Romano?

13:04.870 --> 13:08.870
Dude, you've got 15 seconds left and
you want to ask me about cheese?

13:09.070 --> 13:11.509
- Erm... no?
- What about car-parking?

13:11.510 --> 13:13.989
Ticketing, wrist-bands, security,

13:13.990 --> 13:17.069
insurance, rigging,
lighting, gaffers?

13:17.070 --> 13:20.349
Stage-hire, roadies,
hand-stampers, and that's time.

13:20.350 --> 13:23.429
Where the fuck am I going to find
hand-stampers?

13:23.430 --> 13:26.829
Kingsley, are you sure you should be
taking this on with your finals?

13:26.830 --> 13:29.429
Oh, where's my wooden board?

13:29.430 --> 13:33.430
I like it on a wooden board.
It tastes better on a wooden board.

13:37.630 --> 13:38.989
What is with all the muttering?

13:38.990 --> 13:41.349
I don't know, but she just
put my panini in the bin.

13:41.350 --> 13:45.350
Oh, shit, she's coming back.

13:47.670 --> 13:49.469
Well...

13:49.470 --> 13:51.469
There's the famous Latin
temperament.

13:51.470 --> 13:53.349
I mean, I don't know what
I expected?

13:53.350 --> 13:56.909
If you dip your dick into Mount
Etna, you're going to get burnt.

13:56.910 --> 14:00.909
Er, good luck with organising
your marquee for your orgy.

14:00.910 --> 14:04.910
Oh, erm, I was thinking,
60 quid a ticket? Is that right?

14:05.150 --> 14:07.709
Cos, like, 60 times 1,000...

14:07.710 --> 14:09.869
I mean, I should be able to set up
some sort of pop-up

14:09.870 --> 14:13.870
charcuterie store with 60,000 quid.
Right?

14:14.230 --> 14:15.389
Right.

14:15.390 --> 14:19.149
I mean, forget about the books,
how about I give you a hand?

14:19.150 --> 14:23.150
I know a field and it's fallow
as fuck.

14:26.270 --> 14:30.270
Just a few details before we
can proceed with your emergency
hardship application.

14:30.510 --> 14:33.749
Please. Take your time.

14:33.750 --> 14:35.429
It's just nice to be warm.

14:35.430 --> 14:38.509
Can I ask what your, er,
living status is, Jonathan?

14:38.510 --> 14:40.109
Landlord.

14:40.110 --> 14:41.949
You're a homeowner?

14:41.950 --> 14:43.829
I am asset-rich but cash-poor.

14:43.830 --> 14:46.029
Which, I don't know whether
you know, Janet,

14:46.030 --> 14:49.109
is just an absolute fucker.

14:49.110 --> 14:52.549
Can I ask what your household
income is? In terms of your parents?

14:52.550 --> 14:56.469
Respectfully, I'd prefer not
to disclose that as I feel it

14:56.470 --> 14:59.709
may negatively influence
the outcome of my application.

14:59.710 --> 15:02.189
Just so you're aware, based on
what you've told me, I think

15:02.190 --> 15:03.669
it's highly unlikely...

15:03.670 --> 15:06.709
Why?! Because of my bearing?

15:06.710 --> 15:09.149
Let me tell you a little story.

15:09.150 --> 15:11.789
Christopher Biggins.

15:11.790 --> 15:15.790
Privately-educated, very popular
entertainer... Bankrupt!

15:16.630 --> 15:18.389
It happens.

15:18.390 --> 15:22.229
And at this point, with regret,
it has become necessary for me

15:22.230 --> 15:24.549
to ask for assistance
from the state.

15:24.550 --> 15:26.269
We have limited resources

15:26.270 --> 15:29.349
and with the recent cuts
we have to focus our funding.

15:29.350 --> 15:31.109
Oregon.

15:31.110 --> 15:35.110
Fucking Oregon.

15:41.350 --> 15:42.869
Don't freak. I repeat.

15:42.870 --> 15:46.870
Do not freak.
Blink if you understand.

15:47.350 --> 15:49.429
Apparently there's a petition
going round.

15:49.430 --> 15:52.189
They've got 100 signatures.

15:52.190 --> 15:56.190
They've triggered a vote of no
confidence. I am so sorry, Oregon.

15:56.630 --> 15:58.789
They're moving to impeach.

16:05.190 --> 16:06.589
Impeachment!

16:06.590 --> 16:08.149
They're trying to overthrow me!

16:08.150 --> 16:12.150
Midway through planting a crabapple
tree and they drop this shit on me.

16:12.270 --> 16:13.709
100 names.

16:13.710 --> 16:15.429
The Traitor Menu.

16:15.430 --> 16:19.430
I mean, I'm not putting them
on a watch list, but...

16:19.590 --> 16:21.949
Mmm, your girlfriend signed this.

16:21.950 --> 16:23.509
What can I tell you? La Donna.

16:23.510 --> 16:24.869
She's her own animal.

16:24.870 --> 16:28.469
God, I wish she'd just
fuck off back to Switzerland.

16:28.470 --> 16:29.909
Erm, Italy.

16:29.910 --> 16:32.309
Why would she fuck off back
to Italy?

16:32.310 --> 16:33.989
Because she's from Italy.

16:33.990 --> 16:36.029
She might fuck off via Switzerland.

16:36.030 --> 16:38.189
- She's not Italian.
- She's totally Italian.

16:38.190 --> 16:41.589
No! She speaks Italian because she's
from one of the Italian cantons

16:41.590 --> 16:42.909
in Switzerland.

16:42.910 --> 16:45.509
Italian cantons of Switzerland?
You just made that up!

16:45.510 --> 16:49.429
You know, Switzerland. Chocolate.
Cuckoo clocks. Dignitas.

16:49.430 --> 16:52.829
Nom-nom-nom-nom. Cuckoo!

16:52.830 --> 16:55.589
Switzerland? Famously stayed out of
World War II?

16:55.590 --> 16:59.509
Ironic considering the politics
of your Nazi, fucking wife.

16:59.510 --> 17:01.749
Swiss...

17:01.750 --> 17:04.829
Hmm, Switzerland?

17:04.829 --> 17:07.949
'My Swiss girlfriend,
Swiss girlfriend, Swiss girlfriend,

17:07.950 --> 17:10.749
'Swiss girlfriend...'

17:10.750 --> 17:12.269
So, what's your next move?

17:12.270 --> 17:15.388
Well, I've got until the vote at 8pm
tomorrow to balance the budget

17:15.390 --> 17:17.029
and get the books straight,

17:17.030 --> 17:21.030
meanwhile I'm tit-high in Tony's
fucking turbot.

17:26.270 --> 17:29.349
Hello, Night-Line.
My name's Natasha,

17:29.350 --> 17:32.869
how can I help you?

17:32.870 --> 17:34.549
Hello, Natasha.

17:34.550 --> 17:37.029
How are you doing tonight?

17:37.030 --> 17:38.149
Not great.

17:38.150 --> 17:41.509
Whatever it is, I'm sure I can help.

17:41.510 --> 17:44.029
I'm closing Night-Line.

17:44.030 --> 17:46.869
Who is this?

17:46.870 --> 17:50.870
This is Oregon Shawcross.
Your President.

17:53.750 --> 17:56.709
I have just have been on a bus

17:56.710 --> 17:58.389
to the supermarket,

17:58.390 --> 18:00.669
where I bought some bones.

18:00.670 --> 18:02.389
I'm about to boil some pasta in
a minute.

18:02.390 --> 18:03.989
If you want you can have my water.

18:03.990 --> 18:06.949
Now I know what reality feels like.

18:06.950 --> 18:08.669
Scratchy and harsh.

18:08.670 --> 18:10.669
You're being pathetic.

18:10.670 --> 18:14.549
Yes, I am being pathetic, Josie,
defiantly pathetic.

18:14.550 --> 18:16.709
I can't do this by myself.

18:16.710 --> 18:18.229
I need help.

18:18.230 --> 18:22.230
Somebody help me.

18:22.430 --> 18:26.430
Well, I have finally e-mailed my CV
to Ordnance Survey HQ.

18:26.870 --> 18:30.870
Interests and hobbies include -
reading, walking and street magic.

18:34.430 --> 18:36.749
- Street magic?
- You put down street magic?

18:36.750 --> 18:38.269
Why did you put street magic?

18:38.270 --> 18:42.270
Because I asked JP, and he said put
something cool down like street magic.

18:42.470 --> 18:45.549
I said, put down something
cool LIKE street magic.

18:45.550 --> 18:47.909
I didn't say, put fucking
street magic.

18:47.910 --> 18:49.909
Oh, hot, horny hell have
I made an error?

18:49.910 --> 18:52.669
They're going to have this stack of
boring CVs and then the resume

18:52.670 --> 18:55.789
of David fucking Blaine. What do you
think their first question will be?

18:55.790 --> 18:57.589
- Can you levitate?
- Will you smash my watch?

18:57.590 --> 19:00.029
- Can you teleport?
- Can you turn invisible.

19:00.030 --> 19:03.029
Can you burn a?50 note, and then
you cough and it's in your mouth?

19:03.030 --> 19:05.269
Do you honestly think they'll
expect me to levitate?

19:05.270 --> 19:07.989
They'll expect something in
the levitation ballpark, yeah.

19:07.990 --> 19:11.990
I'm on a hiding to nothing on
this one because I'm one of the most
land-borne people I know.

19:13.190 --> 19:17.190
Right? Can somebody spot me
some croutons for my bone soup?

19:19.350 --> 19:21.989
Where's our bus!
Where's our bus!

19:21.990 --> 19:24.589
Where's our bus! Shawcross out!

19:30.670 --> 19:33.909
Whack the head!
It's filled with Haribo!

19:33.910 --> 19:37.109
Hey, I got a good one!
Orry-Orry-Ore-gone!

19:37.110 --> 19:39.469
Out-out-out!

19:39.470 --> 19:41.389
Orry-Orry-Ore-gone...

19:41.390 --> 19:44.469
Josie, what are you doing?

19:44.470 --> 19:46.829
Er... This...

19:46.830 --> 19:49.829
this is just a harmless
bit of satirical fun.

19:49.830 --> 19:51.469
Is that an effigy?

19:51.470 --> 19:53.109
- Are they going to burn me?
- No.

19:53.110 --> 19:56.789
No! Erm, not until they've got all
the sweets out of your big head.

19:56.790 --> 19:58.909
Josie. This is horrible!

19:58.910 --> 20:02.869
Come on. It's just a bit of,
you know, knock-about fun.

20:02.870 --> 20:05.949
Punch and Judy politics.
Don't take it so personally.

20:05.950 --> 20:07.549
They're going to set fire to ME.

20:07.550 --> 20:11.269
Oregon. I don't want politics
to come between our friendship, OK?

20:11.270 --> 20:14.469
But, y'know, closing down
Night-Line...

20:14.470 --> 20:16.549
It got six calls a week!

20:23.230 --> 20:25.789
Oh, whoa! God! That really went up!

20:25.790 --> 20:27.549
S'awful.

20:27.550 --> 20:29.589
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

20:29.590 --> 20:30.669
So flammable.

20:30.670 --> 20:34.389
Burn the witch!

20:34.390 --> 20:38.390
That is a killer field.
Beautifully fucking irrigated.

20:39.750 --> 20:41.909
- We should check the acoustics.
- Mmm.

20:41.910 --> 20:45.910
One-two. Two-two. One-two. Two!

20:47.030 --> 20:49.589
- I'm none the wiser.
- Mmm.

20:49.590 --> 20:53.590
Sorry can you put those fucking
sunglasses on, or take them off?

20:56.510 --> 21:00.029
God. Mum again.

21:00.030 --> 21:02.629
Bandit had a seizure.

21:02.630 --> 21:04.269
Who the fuck's Bandit?

21:04.270 --> 21:07.069
The epilepsy dog.

21:07.070 --> 21:09.229
Epilepsy dog had a seizure!

21:09.230 --> 21:11.469
Epilepsy dog has epilepsy?!

21:11.470 --> 21:13.549
Well, does he though?

21:13.550 --> 21:15.749
Or is it all just part
of the mind-war?

21:15.750 --> 21:18.989
"Uni's coming to an end."
"Oh, big coincidence,
Bandit's had a wobbler!"

21:18.990 --> 21:21.549
She probably locked him
in the cupboard under the stairs

21:21.550 --> 21:23.029
with a strobe until he wigged out.

21:23.030 --> 21:25.709
Oh, yeah, she wants you back.
What a bitch(!)

21:25.710 --> 21:27.709
There's no way I'm
moving back with her.

21:27.710 --> 21:31.389
I'd rather move to The Yemen
and work in a salt-mine.

21:31.390 --> 21:33.629
Nah, I'll just stay in Manchester.

21:33.630 --> 21:35.229
Move in with Rosa, probably.

21:35.230 --> 21:36.869
Very homely.

21:36.870 --> 21:38.709
What do you think about her
though? Really?

21:38.710 --> 21:42.189
I tell you what I think about your
Swiss girlfriend, Kingsley. Neutral.

21:42.190 --> 21:44.189
I feel neutral.
Not one side or the other.

21:44.190 --> 21:46.309
- She's just been on my back lately.
- Hmm.

21:46.310 --> 21:47.989
Weighing you down, like one of them

21:47.990 --> 21:50.469
really big Toblerones you
get from Duty Free.

21:50.470 --> 21:53.909
I mean it can't be the case that
I like her less because she's Swiss.

21:53.910 --> 21:57.910
But also, it is the case.

21:58.070 --> 22:00.709
I mean you saw her,
flying off the handle like that.

22:00.710 --> 22:02.389
There's no need for it.

22:02.390 --> 22:06.390
If she's not Italian that just means
she's just really fucking snippy.

22:14.270 --> 22:15.789
Oregon.

22:15.790 --> 22:19.309
I've come to claim?20,000 for the
greatest poem in the world!

22:22.030 --> 22:23.669
There was a young legend from Stow,

22:23.670 --> 22:25.989
Who snorted a kilo of blow.

22:25.990 --> 22:29.990
JP, that's a limerick, you're not
going to win with a limerick.

22:35.150 --> 22:39.150
- There was a young lady
from St Mary's Ca...
- Again - limerick.

22:43.670 --> 22:44.869
There was a young geezer...

22:44.870 --> 22:48.870
If it begins, "There was a young..."
it's a fucking limerick, JP!

23:00.870 --> 23:02.989
- I brought you some sweets.
- Oh, good(!)

23:02.990 --> 23:05.629
They managed to get all the sweets
out of my big flammable

23:05.630 --> 23:08.669
fucking Pinata head before it
exploded into flames?

23:08.670 --> 23:11.229
No. They didn't actually.

23:11.230 --> 23:15.230
We had some packets left over.

23:15.470 --> 23:16.549
So,

23:16.550 --> 23:19.229
the dreaded vote of no confidence.

23:19.230 --> 23:23.230
If only there were some way you
could rise above your problems.

23:27.350 --> 23:28.869
Howard, what are you doing?

23:28.870 --> 23:30.749
I'm levitating.

23:30.750 --> 23:34.750
Like some kind of highly-employable
Christ figure.

23:46.390 --> 23:50.390
Well, I want names, Josie. I am
going to highlight those involved.

23:50.430 --> 23:54.430
It is not Orwellian, it is just
being very bloody organised...

23:55.110 --> 23:58.949
"Jezebel James?"

23:58.950 --> 24:01.149
That's you, isn't it?

24:01.150 --> 24:03.029
You signed this?

24:03.030 --> 24:05.109
I'm desperate. OK, Oregon.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.589
I need friends for next year
and Bad Soc's all I've got.

24:07.590 --> 24:11.590
Yeah, well, you know what?
Fuck Bad Soc.

24:12.710 --> 24:14.309
- No way?
- Yes way.

24:14.310 --> 24:16.269
Funding has been cut.

24:16.270 --> 24:18.669
I am 'Breaking Bad Soc'.

24:18.670 --> 24:20.829
You evil fucking despot.

24:20.830 --> 24:23.625
Sorry, Josie. Death to Sadminton.

24:24.500 --> 24:26.819
Do you think
he looks menacing enough?

24:26.820 --> 24:28.459
Quite sad eyes.

24:28.460 --> 24:32.299
He's big, he's bald, he's bearded.
Tick, tick, tick. Yes, please.

24:32.300 --> 24:35.019
Maybe I should ask him
to manhandle me.

24:35.020 --> 24:39.020
You know, try before you buy.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.619
Plus, we do a lot of security
on match days.

24:43.620 --> 24:45.339
Sweet!

24:45.340 --> 24:47.899
Ooh, do you want, er, Mole
to manhandle you now, Kingo?

24:47.900 --> 24:51.619
Oh, yeah, she's... she's joking.
There's not...

24:51.620 --> 24:54.259
not much man to manhandle, methinks!

24:54.260 --> 24:56.979
What's the, er, damage, you know,
bunce-wise?

24:56.980 --> 24:59.459
1,500 for the night

24:59.460 --> 25:02.819
or nothing and we do the sundries -

25:02.820 --> 25:05.339
coke, weed, pills.

25:05.340 --> 25:08.659
Interesting. Don't think we've found
a supplier yet for our sundries,

25:08.660 --> 25:12.379
have we, Kingo?
- Yeah. So sorry, Mole.

25:12.380 --> 25:16.380
Um... just, yeah, quick conflab
with my associate. Um, yeah.

25:19.740 --> 25:21.739
What the fuck? He's a dealer!

25:21.740 --> 25:24.339
He's a short bald man
from Liverpool in a bomber jacket.

25:24.340 --> 25:25.539
I mean, I'm no Poirot...

25:25.540 --> 25:29.540
Mole - he sounds all nice.
He sounds all Toad of Toad Hall.

25:30.700 --> 25:31.899
He's a drugs mole.

25:31.900 --> 25:35.019
There are going to be
drugs at the Grad Ball, hmm?

25:35.020 --> 25:37.899
So, we either go to the open market

25:37.900 --> 25:41.900
or we go with a local supplier
who provides a quality,

25:41.940 --> 25:43.339
freshly-sourced product.

25:43.340 --> 25:46.699
Don't make him sound like he's some
fucking artisan baker!

25:46.700 --> 25:49.339
He's a drug dealer, he's dangerous.

25:49.340 --> 25:53.340
All right. Don't stack your briefs!
We'll find someone else.

25:53.380 --> 25:55.779
OK, so what now? What's
the etiquette with these people?

25:55.780 --> 25:59.499
Do they have an etiquette
or do we just turn around and walk
away really fucking briskly?

25:59.500 --> 26:03.500
Yeah, that's what we do.

26:12.420 --> 26:14.979
- How are you holding up?
- Yeah, yeah, really good.

26:14.980 --> 26:17.259
Um, I'm looking forward
to my vote of confidence.

26:17.260 --> 26:18.979
I thought it was
a vote of no confidence.

26:18.980 --> 26:22.379
Yeah, well, that all depends
on if you're a negative person

26:22.380 --> 26:23.899
or you're more in the mould

26:23.900 --> 26:26.419
of a Dorothy Parker
meets Ellen MacArthur.

26:26.420 --> 26:29.299
Straw poll - if you were
interviewing me for a job,

26:29.300 --> 26:31.539
would you be impressed
if I, very safely,

26:31.540 --> 26:35.219
launched a small firework
from about my beard?

26:35.220 --> 26:39.220
Two, four, six... no hands!
Great feedback, thanks.

26:41.140 --> 26:44.139
Oregon, can you just
lift your chin up?

26:44.140 --> 26:47.539
I'm doing a cheeky little
lampoon for the protest movement.

26:47.540 --> 26:49.219
You're lampooning me?

26:49.220 --> 26:52.179
Yeah. The Blaster got in touch
out of the blue.

26:52.180 --> 26:56.180
I've been commissioned. I'm getting
paid. Screw you, Tomothy!

26:57.700 --> 27:00.539
All aboard the satirical cartoon
gravy train!

27:00.540 --> 27:03.419
Next stop - Money Town!

27:03.420 --> 27:07.059
Why have I got whisker...
Am I shitting?

27:07.060 --> 27:10.779
You're a fat cat trying to
escape on a hot-air balloon marked

27:10.780 --> 27:13.859
"Corruption" and you're taking
a big steaming shit

27:13.860 --> 27:16.099
onto all of the students
down below you.

27:16.100 --> 27:19.379
But now, this sword with
"Impeachment" written on it

27:19.380 --> 27:21.219
is about to cut off your head.

27:21.220 --> 27:22.459
It is a pretty good likeness,

27:22.460 --> 27:24.339
considering it's a cat
taking a shit.

27:24.340 --> 27:27.899
Well, it's irrelevant
because I've balanced the budget.

27:27.900 --> 27:30.979
Nightline, fell-walking -
cut, cut, cut!

27:30.980 --> 27:34.019
Plus, I've told them
that I've got an appointment
for a yeast infection,

27:34.020 --> 27:36.259
so they pushed the vote
back by two hours.

27:36.260 --> 27:40.260
Oh, no! The England game's tonight.
Uh-oh! There goes the sports vote.

27:41.580 --> 27:43.899
Same old Oregon, same old shit!

27:43.900 --> 27:47.900
No! Actually, JP, new Oregon
cos it's a new day,

27:49.900 --> 27:53.659
new outlook,
new policies, new haircut,

27:53.660 --> 27:56.099
new ideas, new energy, new haircut.

27:56.100 --> 27:58.379
I am going to move on
and I'm changing everything -

27:58.380 --> 28:00.179
new direction, new haircut.

28:00.180 --> 28:01.539
You keep saying new haircut.

28:01.540 --> 28:03.699
New haircut for a new president,

28:03.700 --> 28:07.700
for a new outlook on a new haircut
to inspire new confidence.

28:10.300 --> 28:14.300
Vod, I need you to give me
a new... haircut.

28:14.580 --> 28:18.580
Mm.

28:22.380 --> 28:24.219
So, I was thinking...

28:24.220 --> 28:28.220
All right, I could do that.

28:34.500 --> 28:36.099
OK.

28:36.100 --> 28:40.100
So what I've done is,
I've gone too short on this side.

28:40.540 --> 28:43.179
So I can either go short
on the other side

28:43.180 --> 28:46.619
or you can have slightly wonky hair.

28:46.620 --> 28:48.019
Um...

28:48.020 --> 28:52.020
All right.

28:57.820 --> 28:58.859
OK.

28:58.860 --> 29:02.860
So what's happened here is, I've
gone even shorter on this side,

29:03.380 --> 29:07.380
but I'll just level it up.

29:10.100 --> 29:11.619
OK.

29:11.620 --> 29:15.139
Just to fill you in, basically,
I've done the same thing again.

29:15.140 --> 29:18.299
Yeah, I think I should just
abandon hair at this point.

29:18.300 --> 29:22.099
No president's ever been impeached.
Do you know that?

29:22.100 --> 29:24.339
Apart from Muttock,
but he wasn't impeached,

29:24.340 --> 29:28.179
he just went straight to prison for
killing someone in a road accident.

29:28.180 --> 29:31.299
I don't know how I ended here, Vod.

29:31.300 --> 29:34.259
Maybe Idi Amin started by setting up
a boutique literary award

29:34.260 --> 29:36.459
and then a few things go sideways

29:36.460 --> 29:40.460
and boom! You're the tyrant queen
that killed Nightline.

29:42.900 --> 29:45.259
Is that going to be my legacy?

29:45.260 --> 29:47.939
Oregon, this isn't over.

29:47.940 --> 29:51.940
You walk in there and you let
your natural charm speak for itself!

29:53.420 --> 29:56.379
What natural charm?

29:56.380 --> 30:00.380
You know. Don't pretend
you don't know. I know you know.

30:02.900 --> 30:04.939
You so know!

30:04.940 --> 30:08.579
I guess I could try
and switch it on.

30:08.580 --> 30:12.580
Come on. Let's even this up.

30:13.220 --> 30:17.220
OK.

30:23.860 --> 30:27.860
OK. What's happened here is...

30:28.540 --> 30:31.779
All I'm saying is, it's good that
Vod is helping you with the party.

30:31.780 --> 30:34.819
This way, you can
focus on your study.

30:34.820 --> 30:37.739
Well, that certainly seems to be a
very safe way of looking at things,

30:37.740 --> 30:41.740
Rosa. Very safe, very neutral.

30:41.940 --> 30:43.539
You need to focus on your finals.

30:43.540 --> 30:47.540
A daily reminder of my finals -
regular as the 9.30 from Zurich.

30:47.940 --> 30:49.299
There you go.

30:49.300 --> 30:51.259
Move out of the way, Mum!

31:00.580 --> 31:04.339
Mmm... ma mia! This looks amazing!

31:04.340 --> 31:06.019
I fucking love chicken nuggets!

31:06.020 --> 31:10.020
Thanks, sweetheart,
thanks, darling, thanks, love!

31:15.500 --> 31:18.299
Chicken fucking nuggets!
Fucking result!

31:18.300 --> 31:21.939
I am going to fucking smash these
chicken fucking nuggets!

31:21.940 --> 31:25.940
Yeah, I might eat this in my room.

31:33.620 --> 31:37.620
So, I have tried and failed to
master the dark art of street magic.

31:39.060 --> 31:40.259
And now, boys and girls,

31:40.260 --> 31:44.260
for my next trick, I will
make my career prospects disappear!

31:45.580 --> 31:49.580
Abra and indeed cadabra!

31:50.900 --> 31:52.939
- Is that a trick, Howard?
- No.

31:52.940 --> 31:55.539
It's just the actions of a man
who no longer requires a watch,

31:55.540 --> 31:57.899
be it for appointment or interview.

31:57.900 --> 31:58.979
Sorry, brah.

31:58.980 --> 32:01.019
I'm going to have to call
John at Ordnance Survey

32:01.020 --> 32:03.539
and request that my application be
officially withdrawn.

32:03.540 --> 32:07.540
Theme of the Grad Ball.
The theme is Carnage.

32:08.340 --> 32:10.619
Like...

32:10.620 --> 32:12.699
Chain-saw artists, Wheel of Death,

32:12.700 --> 32:16.539
a woman in iron pants making sparks
with an angle grinder.

32:16.540 --> 32:17.579
That sounds horrific.

32:17.580 --> 32:21.259
Kingo, I'll focus on the bigger
picture. You sort out the details.

32:21.260 --> 32:24.099
What, you're Florence,
I'm just the fucking Machine?

32:24.100 --> 32:26.819
Try to ignore the whirring sound.
That's just the Machine doing

32:26.820 --> 32:30.619
all the fucking work while Florence
fucks about in a floaty dress!
- Well, that's the deal.

32:30.620 --> 32:34.419
- Unless you want to sort it on your own.
- All right. Fine, fine.

32:34.420 --> 32:36.779
All right, compromise.

32:36.780 --> 32:37.899
Cheese and Carnage.

32:37.900 --> 32:39.619
Well, we might as well start.

32:39.620 --> 32:42.219
It looks like this is all
we're getting.

32:42.220 --> 32:45.139
Our motion is clear.

32:45.140 --> 32:48.859
Oregon, throughout your tenure,
we believe you've shown

32:48.860 --> 32:52.499
a lack of leadership,
a lack of judgment,

32:52.500 --> 32:56.500
a lack of character. Actually,
you have a weak character, Oregon.

32:56.980 --> 33:00.859
And I think I speak on behalf
of a majority of the student body

33:00.860 --> 33:04.860
when I say, with regret,
we have no confidence in you.

33:12.820 --> 33:15.899
Firstly, I would like to thank
everybody for coming out

33:15.900 --> 33:19.900
tonight and missing the crucial
Moldova qualifier.

33:20.220 --> 33:24.019
It gives me the perfect opportunity
to announce that we, I,

33:24.020 --> 33:27.579
have finally balanced the budget.

33:27.580 --> 33:31.580
We, I, have had a lot of tough
decisions to make and we, I,

33:32.740 --> 33:36.099
have always had the best interests
of the student body at heart.

33:36.100 --> 33:37.619
What about the turbot?

33:37.620 --> 33:40.899
We know about the receipts.

33:40.900 --> 33:44.459
What receipts?

33:44.460 --> 33:48.460
Er... OK. If I could deal
specifically with the turbot...

33:49.820 --> 33:53.820
Let's get straight into this,
shall we? Votes against impeachment.

33:54.740 --> 33:58.259
- Is that us?
- Yeah.

33:58.260 --> 34:02.260
Oi, Dynamo! Levitate yourself
out of that fucking seat right now!

34:07.780 --> 34:11.779
OK. Votes for impeachment.

34:11.780 --> 34:12.819
Wait!

34:12.820 --> 34:16.820
Er, if I could, before they sit
down again, everybody,

34:18.100 --> 34:22.100

35:26.900 --> 35:30.219

Man In The Mirror that I knew
she was in trouble.

Found these under the mat.

Um, I'm just off the phone
to John at Ordnance Survey

35:43.180 --> 35:45.739
and I came clean about my CV.

35:45.740 --> 35:48.619
I told him it was just a sexed-up
dossier of mistruths

35:48.620 --> 35:52.620
printed on a tissue of lies,
and he said he admired my honesty.

35:53.100 --> 35:56.619
And so, if I get a First,
the job's mine.

35:56.620 --> 35:58.939
Holy shit, bro!
Wax up the Oyster card

35:58.940 --> 36:02.940

You're moving to London!

36:06.180 --> 36:10.180

36:11.260 --> 36:15.260
Yeah, you can do security.
Yeah, and drugs.

36:17.980 --> 36:20.899
'Yeah, he'd be cool with that.
Yeah.'

36:20.900 --> 36:22.579
It was me, by the way.

36:22.580 --> 36:26.099
I gave the Blaster your number and
told them you were good at cartoons.

36:26.100 --> 36:27.779
Oh, thanks.

36:27.780 --> 36:30.659
I've been thinking about our little
trade agreement.

36:30.660 --> 36:34.259
Maybe I could impose a sort of
import ban.

36:34.260 --> 36:38.260
You know, not import from any
non-Josie territories,

36:38.940 --> 36:41.859
withdraw from the EU.

36:41.860 --> 36:45.860
JP, I think that maybe we shouldn't.

36:46.900 --> 36:49.419
We need to stop.

36:49.420 --> 36:51.419
It's over.

36:51.420 --> 36:55.420
Yeah, good. No, I mean... cos
that was my other idea, so...

36:57.140 --> 37:01.140
Oh, and, er, the Blaster said sorry
but, um...

37:02.140 --> 37:03.579
...this is all they could give you.

37:19.220 --> 37:23.220

I'll take the job.
