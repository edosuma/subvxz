It seems today
that all you see

00:04.671 --> 00:08.091
Is violence in
movies and sex on TV

00:08.175 --> 00:11.637
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.720 --> 00:14.848
On which we used to rely?

00:14.932 --> 00:18.060
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.143 --> 00:21.313
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

00:21.396 --> 00:22.856
All the things that make us

00:22.940 --> 00:24.608
Laugh and cry

Wow, this must be
one of them new plasma TVs.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.374
Would you like
something to drink?

00:40.457 --> 00:41.583
I'll have water, please.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.126
I'll have water, too,
but with lemon.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.753
I'll have a Sam Adams.

00:44.837 --> 00:46.421
It's 9:30 in the morning.

00:46.505 --> 00:48.549
And don't you have
an outstanding DUI?

00:48.632 --> 00:50.050
Yeah, but I got to
get the taste of weed

00:50.133 --> 00:52.052
and hooker spit
out of my mouth.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.429
I'll have a Sam Adams, too.

00:54.513 --> 00:57.891
Samuel Adams.
Always a good decision.

00:57.975 --> 00:59.643
Okay, now,
if I get a fax,

00:59.726 --> 01:02.396
can I stay on-line and still receive
the fax without a dedicated line?

01:02.479 --> 01:06.567
Yeah, you can put a piece of paper in here
and make, like, a phone call,

01:06.650 --> 01:07.943
and your friend
will get another

01:08.026 --> 01:09.862
piece of paper
with the same picture.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.364
Can I possibly
speak to someone

01:12.447 --> 01:14.616
who didn't come
to this country on a floating door?

01:14.700 --> 01:15.826
Can I help you?

01:15.909 --> 01:17.703
Yes. We're here
to replace our VCR.

01:17.786 --> 01:20.372
Yeah, don't try any
of your salesman funny business.

01:20.455 --> 01:23.083

to buy that pet tyrannosaurus.

Ew! It's got spit
all over it.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.846
A VCR?
Let me show you something.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.139
It's called TiVo.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.557
It always records
what you're watching,

01:38.640 --> 01:40.267
so you can re-watch
anything you missed.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.811
Sounds fancy.
How does it work?

01:42.895 --> 01:45.939
I'll tell you how it works.
Easy as pie is how it works.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.441
(BEEPING)

01:47.524 --> 01:49.943
I'll tell you how it works.

01:50.027 --> 01:51.945
Should I ring it up?
Hold on, hold on.

01:52.029 --> 01:54.364
I think we should
discuss it first.

that's how I saved Christmas.

02:01.038 --> 02:02.748
Yeah, go ahead and
bag this thing for us.

You got a Winnebago.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.551
Oh, how clever.

02:14.635 --> 02:15.928
Yeah, I'm gonna take her
across the country

02:16.011 --> 02:18.430
and nail a different
broad in every state.

02:18.514 --> 02:19.765
Also gonna go to Vegas.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.391
We went to Vegas once.

through these pesky TV shows,

to be short with my family.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.577
I can't sleep at night.

02:40.661 --> 02:43.497
The other day, I stubbed my toe
and took it out on the dog.

And two weeks ago,
I ran out of

like to rename San Francisco?

03:27.624 --> 03:29.042

the wonderful shoe shopping,

Look, I'm gonna
start spending some time with Chris,

08:49.655 --> 08:51.782
and I'll show him
how to attract a woman.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.992
Yeah. And I'll spend
some time with Meg.

08:54.076 --> 08:55.619
I've spent lots
of time with her,

08:55.702 --> 08:58.622
like when we went on our last crusade
to find the holy grail.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.499
Choose wisely.

09:00.582 --> 09:01.708
I choose this one.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.836
How did you know?

09:03.919 --> 09:06.046
Well, I kind of figured the coffee mug
that says "Jesus." I mean...

09:06.129 --> 09:07.548
Oh, right, right. Yeah.

09:07.631 --> 09:09.007
Pretty obvious.

09:09.091 --> 09:10.551
Great. Let's kiss on it.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.135
Come here, you!

09:16.932 --> 09:19.434

Yeah, you're bleeding.

09:21.645 --> 09:23.480
Don't tell me you're
going to California on that.

Bicycling is hard,
but it has its benefits.

09:26.275 --> 09:29.736
Did you know Lance Armstrong
is dating Sheryl Crow?

09:29.820 --> 09:31.446
You know, it really
speaks to her character

09:31.530 --> 09:34.449
that she can get
past the whole "he had cancer" thing

09:34.533 --> 09:36.243
and still find him
sexually attractive.

09:36.326 --> 09:37.619
Really speaks
to her character.

09:37.703 --> 09:39.121
I respect that.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.039
Hey, Brian,
what do you think of my sign?

09:41.123 --> 09:43.417
"Quagmire's
cross-country tour."

09:43.500 --> 09:44.751
Uh, isn't there
an "o" in "country"?

09:44.835 --> 09:45.919
Nope.

09:46.003 --> 09:48.046
Look out, California,
here I come!

Well, you heard
Captain Syphilis.

09:53.177 --> 09:54.261
We're going to California.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.722
Come on, you can't go
alone with Quagmire.

09:56.805 --> 09:57.848
Look, I'll tell you what,

09:57.931 --> 10:01.018
if you're serious about this
I'll go with you.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.228
Although I should probably ask
Peter and Lois if it's okay.

10:03.312 --> 10:06.565
Oh, they won't
even know we're gone.

I am a tool.

than me at everything

10:12.613 --> 10:14.656
including arts and
crafts and the guitar.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.325
I have no friends.

are joining me.

see 3 Men and a Baby?

10:20.037 --> 10:21.830

10:21.914 --> 10:23.457
Did you know there's a ghost
in there behind the window?

10:23.540 --> 10:25.209
That's an urban legend.
It's just a piece of cardboard.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.585
No, it's a ghost,
I heard.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.128
You heard from who?

10:28.212 --> 10:29.671
From, uh, Lois.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.089
Yeah, right.

No. No.

No, my bishop was
at king's rook six.

and he'll purr like a walrus.

only take one, but I took all of them.

should slow down.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.716

15:24.800 --> 15:26.385
We're not even on the road.
Huh?

even on the road.

15:32.558 --> 15:33.767
I know.

on those guys who did this in a wagon?

15:35.602 --> 15:37.396
Pioneers, Brian.
We share their spirit.

15:37.479 --> 15:38.689
Manifest destiny.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.274

I'm so thirsty.

do you see what I see?

16:28.989 --> 16:30.324
Oh, that's it, I give up!

16:30.407 --> 16:31.700
What do you mean?

16:31.783 --> 16:33.118
I never should
have attempted this

16:33.202 --> 16:34.828
in the first place.
It was stupid.

16:34.912 --> 16:36.163

haven't you?

16:37.539 --> 16:39.625

16:39.708 --> 16:41.627
Even if my real
father is out there,

doesn't want to see me.

to see this through to the end.

Look, maybe this guy
is your real father,

16:48.926 --> 16:51.261
maybe not,
but if you don't find out,

16:51.345 --> 16:54.139
you're gonna spend
the rest of your life wondering.

16:54.223 --> 16:55.766
Maybe you're right.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.768
Come on, I'll stick
by you the whole way.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.354
Just like I did
when we were Siamese twins.

17:00.437 --> 17:01.939
Hey, hey,
look at that woman, Brian.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.482
She has no
business in shorts.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.984
Hey! Hey, you have
no business in shorts!

17:06.068 --> 17:08.445
Oh, tortillas.
Let's do soft tacos tonight.

17:11.740 --> 17:13.200
Well, we've taught
you well, children.

17:13.283 --> 17:14.743
It's in God's hands now.

17:14.826 --> 17:16.954
Now go to the mall
and find yourselves some dates.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.664
Chris, find a girl
who smokes.

17:18.747 --> 17:21.083
Remember,
if she smokes, she pokes.

17:21.166 --> 17:22.376
Bye, kids.

17:22.459 --> 17:23.585
Do you think
they're ready, Peter?

17:23.669 --> 17:25.170
I don't care.

17:25.254 --> 17:27.589
All I care about
is that we have our alone time.

17:27.673 --> 17:28.757
Me, too.

17:28.841 --> 17:30.092
Are we terrible people?

17:30.175 --> 17:32.594
No, no. We're not
terrible people, Lois.

17:32.678 --> 17:34.471
Horses are terrible people.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.098
(CHOKING)

17:36.181 --> 17:38.350
Murder! Murder!

17:51.238 --> 17:53.949
All right, let's split up
and try to find him.

17:57.035 --> 17:58.620
Hey, yeah,
I just checked in.

17:58.704 --> 17:59.872
Yeah, I might lose you.

17:59.955 --> 18:01.039
I just got in the elevator.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.417
Yeah, I'm gonna
grab a shower.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.043
Did you guys eat yet?

18:06.128 --> 18:08.213
No, no.
No, I'll just take a cab.

18:09.423 --> 18:11.633
You got your car?

18:11.717 --> 18:13.385
Do you want to pick me up?

18:13.468 --> 18:14.761
Do you want...

18:14.845 --> 18:16.263
Do you want to pick me up?

18:16.346 --> 18:18.015
Do you want to pick me up?

18:18.098 --> 18:19.558
Do you want to pick me up?

18:19.641 --> 18:21.185
Do you want to pick me up?

18:21.268 --> 18:23.103
(WHISTLING)

18:28.317 --> 18:29.318
(GASPS)

18:29.401 --> 18:30.611
Father!

18:45.876 --> 18:47.794
Utini! Utini!

18:47.878 --> 18:49.213
Filthy creatures.

19:07.606 --> 19:09.107
Whoa! Whoa!

19:09.191 --> 19:11.902
Damn! Why is there
always a fruit stand?

19:11.985 --> 19:13.320
DIPATCHER: High-speed
pursuit in progress.

19:13.403 --> 19:15.781
Headed south on Powell
toward Market Street.

19:15.864 --> 19:18.700
You heard him, people,
Powell and Market. Move it.

19:21.203 --> 19:23.956
I feel like I've searched
this whole bloody city.

19:24.039 --> 19:25.541
I suppose this
means I'll never find

19:25.624 --> 19:27.125
the answer to
who I really am.

19:27.209 --> 19:28.919
Oh, well,
see you gents later.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.129
Free Tibet,
no grapes, all that.

19:31.213 --> 19:33.131
Dude, I could
have sworn that NERF Football

19:33.215 --> 19:34.341
was just talking to me.

19:34.424 --> 19:35.884
(DINGING)

19:36.927 --> 19:38.011
Are you done with
the arts section?

19:38.846 --> 19:39.972
Of course.

19:40.055 --> 19:41.056
(GASPS)

19:41.640 --> 19:42.975
My God!

19:43.058 --> 19:44.309
Oh, dear.

19:44.393 --> 19:46.645
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
This is not good.

19:46.728 --> 19:48.355
This is very bad, very bad.

19:48.438 --> 19:50.023
Oh, Daddy,
I knew I'd find you!

19:50.107 --> 19:51.984
I knew Peter
couldn't be my real father.

19:52.067 --> 19:54.278
No, no, no, you've got
it all wrong, Stewie.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.363
Stewie?
How do you know my name?

19:56.446 --> 19:58.365
Because I'm not your father.

19:58.448 --> 19:59.908
I'm you.

19:59.992 --> 20:03.120
MALE NARRATOR: Could this man
really be Stewie?

20:03.203 --> 20:06.456
Will the cell-phone guy's
friend pick him up?

20:06.540 --> 20:09.418
Will our younger viewers
get this Soap reference?

20:09.501 --> 20:11.837
The answers to
these questions and many others

20:11.920 --> 20:14.214
will be answered
in the next episode.
