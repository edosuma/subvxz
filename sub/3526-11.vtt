01:39.666 --> 01:41.964
So every time l asked
you ''How's work?'' and you said ''Fine,''

01:42.001 --> 01:44.401
you were having your own private
little joke on me?

01:44.437 --> 01:46.735
What's going on?

01:46.773 --> 01:49.537
l went to Blockbuster
today to rent ''Cinderella Man''

01:49.576 --> 01:52.170
- and guess what?
- ls it still a classic?

01:52.212 --> 01:54.646
l found out
that our son-- the liar--

01:54.681 --> 01:57.582
had been fired
three weeks ago.

01:57.617 --> 01:59.744
From Blockbuster?
How the fuck do you do that?

01:59.786 --> 02:02.482
They got Rhesus monkeys
working as managers over there.

02:02.522 --> 02:05.821
He was taking promotional items
and selling them-- posters, standups.

02:05.859 --> 02:08.089
Standees!
This whole thing's bullshit.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.687
Most of that stuff
gets thrown out anyway.

02:10.729 --> 02:12.823
The store's policy
was very clear.

02:12.866 --> 02:15.357
Well maybe l care
about the environment.

02:15.401 --> 02:17.869
Did that ever occur to you?
''Wallace and Gromit,''

02:17.904 --> 02:21.362
l mean that weighed like 50 lbs. How
many trees gave their lives for that?

02:21.407 --> 02:22.931
lt just goes to the dump.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.843
Can l come home to a peaceful
house one goddamn night?

02:25.879 --> 02:27.403
You tell me to think like
a businessman,

02:27.447 --> 02:29.608
yet every time
l do there's something wrong.

02:29.649 --> 02:32.516
l made money promoting parties
in high school, that was no good.

02:32.552 --> 02:33.883
- Now this.
- You know what l think?

02:33.920 --> 02:37.754
All those days you go in late, you call
in sick, you deserve to get canned.

02:37.790 --> 02:40.190
The worst part is
you don't even give a shit.

02:40.226 --> 02:43.855
What, l should care about Blockbuster?
Fucking religious fanatics!

02:43.897 --> 02:45.922
l can't live on what
they pay me anyway.

02:45.965 --> 02:49.332
Why not?!
You live at home! We feed you!

02:49.369 --> 02:51.064
You have a social life
but l can't?

02:51.104 --> 02:53.868
You have any idea what
it costs at a decent club in New York?

02:53.907 --> 02:57.638
lt's $500 for a bottle of Cristal,
and it's a two-bottle minimum.

02:57.677 --> 03:01.477
You spend $1,000 a night
on champagne?

03:03.249 --> 03:05.114
No, not every night.

03:05.151 --> 03:07.813
All right, barely ever.
And Hernan, everybody--

03:07.854 --> 03:09.788
we take turns
picking up the tab.

03:09.822 --> 03:12.689
Hernan? Or the girl he crippled
when he flipped over the car?

03:12.725 --> 03:15.694
ls she there, drinking champagne
with you... in her wheelchair?

03:15.728 --> 03:17.753
lt wasn't his fault.

03:17.797 --> 03:19.856
Her parents are going
for a big payday

03:19.899 --> 03:21.423
because his dad was
in ''Forbes'' magazine.

03:21.467 --> 03:23.435
Oh God Almighty!

03:23.469 --> 03:25.562
lf it makes you feel any better
l've been looking for a new job--

03:25.605 --> 03:27.368
every day online!

03:28.441 --> 03:30.375
Oh Jesus!
You can't even talk to her.

03:30.410 --> 03:33.174
Are you fucking kidding me?
You should be kissing her feet.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.511
Because when you were growing up,
if it wasn't for her,

03:35.548 --> 03:37.948
l would have knocked
all your baby teeth out with one shot.

03:52.498 --> 03:54.159
l can't sleep.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.430
- AJ.
- Somebody call?

03:56.469 --> 03:59.905
lt's not only that he's
a complete stranger to the truth,

03:59.939 --> 04:03.466
he's got this dead streak in him.
lt chills me to the bone.

04:03.509 --> 04:07.001
He's fuckin' spoiled, that's all.
We gave him too much.

04:07.046 --> 04:09.742
Come on, he went to school
with lots of privileged kids.

04:09.782 --> 04:13.377
Most of them are off in lvy League
universities now, doing very well.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.216
No, this is something in him.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.382
Deep down it's like this big
''Fuck you'' to everything.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.254
l don't know
what that's about.

04:19.291 --> 04:22.489
Remember that whole God-is-dead
business on the day of his confirmation?

04:22.528 --> 04:23.893
Maybe he'll surprise us.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.694
Aren't you the sunny optimist
when you want to go to sleep?

04:32.205 --> 04:35.436
- l saw the light was on. Can l come in?
- Sure, hon'.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.810
l'm going to California.
l don't know for how long.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.750
California?
What are you talking about?

04:45.785 --> 04:47.878
Finn took that year off.
And it was great

04:47.920 --> 04:49.785
when Dad was hurt--
he was here for me.

04:49.822 --> 04:53.849
But now he's going back to dental
school, l want to be with him.

04:53.893 --> 04:56.327
l thought you two
were having problems.

04:56.362 --> 04:58.956
l never said that.

05:01.701 --> 05:04.636
l don't know if l want to go
to law school or med school.

05:04.671 --> 05:07.105
Those are nice
options to have.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.267
That's what we call
a high-class problem.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.936
His dad said
that he can get me

05:10.977 --> 05:13.138
a lab job at UCLA
where he teaches oral surgery.

05:13.179 --> 05:14.908
l mean, if l decide
on med school

05:14.947 --> 05:17.142
that will look really great
on my application.

05:17.183 --> 05:20.880
What you're really saying is you're
following this man to California.

05:22.355 --> 05:25.586
Meadow, you drop this bomb on us
at 1 :30 in the morning--

05:25.625 --> 05:28.219
forgive us if we need
some time to adjust.

05:28.261 --> 05:31.526
- l have to make plane reservations--
- You'll be back for Christmas?

05:31.564 --> 05:35.227
l don't know.
No pressure please, okay?

06:02.295 --> 06:05.560
Tidelands project--
your slice of no-shows--

06:05.598 --> 06:08.226
l spoke to the union
and we can't make five work no more.

06:08.267 --> 06:12.067
Rollbacks, not to mention
my end's way down.

06:12.105 --> 06:14.471
Now more than ever
l got captains looking to me

06:14.507 --> 06:16.372
to deliver them
those no-show jobs

06:16.409 --> 06:20.539
- on account of the medical insurance.
- Health care costs these days.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.980
Bitch all you want
about John, he understood

06:23.015 --> 06:25.609
that ours is
a mutually-beneficial arrangement.

06:25.651 --> 06:28.142
John's folding laundry
in fucking Danbury.

06:28.187 --> 06:30.849
lt's on my shoulders
to take care of the family,

06:30.890 --> 06:33.256
even if he's
boss just in name.

06:33.292 --> 06:37.092
Now l made a decision,
and with all due respect, it's final.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.461
You see, this is what l get.

06:38.498 --> 06:40.762
l never should have let
you slide on the vitamins.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.859
Again with the vitamins.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.894
You told me there were
1500 cases of Centrums on that truck.

06:45.938 --> 06:48.566
When your nephew delivered it,
there were cartons ripped open,

06:48.608 --> 06:51.634
pills all over the floor.
Anybody got shorted,

06:51.677 --> 06:53.440
it was yours truly,
but you know what--

06:53.479 --> 06:55.777
All right, all right, all right,
put it back in your pocket.

06:55.815 --> 06:58.147
But l gotta get some relief
on this other situation.

07:10.363 --> 07:13.730
For the Supreme Commander's
control over the sworn enemy's

07:13.766 --> 07:16.860
capital city is the epitome
of their power in Europe.

07:21.407 --> 07:24.843
l need to talk to you. Remember l told
you about that trip to Paris?

07:24.877 --> 07:27.869
l won it at the silent auction
at the feast.

07:30.082 --> 07:33.347
Well, the date is here and l think
l would like to go.

07:35.488 --> 07:38.855
You don't remember the first goddamn
thing about this, do you?

07:38.891 --> 07:41.689
We stood right here talking
about it for 15 minutes.

07:41.727 --> 07:44.491
- l know, you won a trip to Paris.
- Why do you have to lie?

07:44.530 --> 07:46.828
l'm not! You're always
saying l'm lying.

07:49.735 --> 07:51.066
Why Paris?

07:51.103 --> 07:53.469
lt is one of the great cities
of the world.

07:53.506 --> 07:55.098
But the frogs hate us.

07:57.009 --> 07:58.442
Go to ltaly.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.036
They weren't auctioning
a trip to ltaly.

08:00.079 --> 08:04.038
lt's actually a good deal.
lt's a week for two for $5,000.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.677
How's the euro doing?

08:06.719 --> 08:08.914
l don't know, Tony.

08:08.955 --> 08:11.890
l had three years
of high-school French.

08:11.924 --> 08:15.553
- l can't get away for a week, Carm.
- l could go with Ro.

08:15.595 --> 08:18.325
We've been talking
about taking a trip together for years--

08:18.364 --> 08:20.525
ever since our Rome thing
went belly up.

08:20.566 --> 08:24.400
Oh yeah... when Anthony walked
through the plate-glass door.

08:27.173 --> 08:31.200
l could really use a vacation now--
Meadow leaving,

08:31.244 --> 08:33.940
my spec house-- the thought of tearing
it down and starting over,

08:33.980 --> 08:35.971
- it makes me nauseous.
- Yeah.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.451
Plus him. l just don't
know what to do anymore.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.183
You know what?
You should go.

08:44.222 --> 08:47.056
You deserve it.

08:47.093 --> 08:49.323
lt'd be good for you too.
Do whatever it is

08:49.362 --> 08:51.353
that boys do when
they're on their own.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.359
Whatever.
l said go.

08:55.401 --> 08:57.835
l'll be fine.

09:01.340 --> 09:03.900
l'm so excited.
l'm gonna call Ro.

09:05.611 --> 09:07.602
Oh, wait wait!
Look.

09:19.759 --> 09:22.455
Tony? Hey.

09:22.495 --> 09:25.328
What the fuck?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.991
My brother's over there.

09:33.306 --> 09:36.605
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing. He's just there, that's all.

09:36.642 --> 09:39.338
You sandbag me, l cut
your fucking throat open.

09:39.378 --> 09:41.642
l'm sorry.
l didn't know what else to do.

09:44.283 --> 09:46.251
l want back in.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.415
- Can l sit?
- No, you can't sit.

09:50.456 --> 09:53.619
lt was complicated.
l was working things out.

09:53.659 --> 09:56.719
l'm sure it gets complicated when you're
taking it up your fag ass.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.957
l'm not a fag.
l never was.

09:58.998 --> 10:01.091
- Excuse me?
- lt was the medication l was on.

10:01.133 --> 10:03.101
For my blood pressure.

10:03.135 --> 10:06.263
lt fucked with my head,
but l'm over that now.

10:06.305 --> 10:08.239
l can probably get
a letter from my doctor.

10:08.274 --> 10:11.675
A note from your doctor
saying you don't like to suck cock?

10:11.711 --> 10:13.702
First off,

10:13.746 --> 10:15.737
l pay my way back in.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.773
l got 200K that goes directly
to you personally.

10:18.818 --> 10:20.649
No one else
needs to know.

10:26.092 --> 10:29.493
Long term, l know
construction's out.

10:29.528 --> 10:31.257
Those guys--

10:31.297 --> 10:34.289
but meth, running girls,

10:34.333 --> 10:36.233
a lot more
tolerant atmosphere.

10:36.268 --> 10:38.133
l got contacts in A.C.

10:38.170 --> 10:41.139
With your support
l could set myself up there.

10:41.173 --> 10:44.631
l'd be close
but not too close.

10:44.677 --> 10:46.440
Ton'!

10:46.479 --> 10:49.346
Please, don't turn
your back on me.

10:49.382 --> 10:52.442
He was fucking
stalking you, T.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.352
That's the thing
with the gays.

10:55.388 --> 10:58.789
lt's the living in the closet,
makes them devious.

10:58.824 --> 11:01.816
Speaking of crystal meth,
look at this walyo.

11:04.096 --> 11:07.156
Say what you will
about Richie Aprile,

11:07.199 --> 11:09.224
but when he found out
his son was gay,

11:09.268 --> 11:11.532
he did the right thing.
He disowned him.

11:11.570 --> 11:13.868
l got an AA meeting.

11:18.411 --> 11:21.209
Alcoholics-fucking-Anonymous
now too...

11:22.648 --> 11:26.744
Salvatore Lucania must be looking
down on all of us with great pride.

11:26.786 --> 11:29.220
There's gonna be a lot
of popular sentiment

11:29.255 --> 11:31.052
to get rid of Vito.
Phil alone--

11:31.090 --> 11:33.115
Fuck Phil!

11:33.159 --> 11:36.356
You know what that's about? He's gotta
polish his rep as a tough prick

11:36.395 --> 11:39.296
so he can make boss.
Vito in Atlantic City...

11:39.331 --> 11:41.959
he's out there.
He's not part of us.

11:42.001 --> 11:45.767
And we get, you know, a trickle
of cash coming in each month.

12:02.321 --> 12:04.983
- You ready?
- Oh, there's so much going on here,

12:05.024 --> 12:07.993
just the thought of flying,
the heightened security...

12:09.128 --> 12:10.595
Come on.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.992
l got something for you,
for your trip.

12:19.638 --> 12:22.198
Now this is the real
Louis ''Vitoon.''

12:28.614 --> 12:31.242
You had a rough year--
me in the hospital,

12:31.283 --> 12:33.308
you there
around the clock--

12:33.352 --> 12:35.843
l want you
to enjoy yourself.

12:35.888 --> 12:37.583
Hmm?

12:40.025 --> 12:43.051
When you were in that coma,
l told you l loved you.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.723
- Do you remember?
- No.

12:48.868 --> 12:52.304
- l should tell you more often.
- Well...

12:52.338 --> 12:54.329
nobody's stopping ya.

12:58.644 --> 13:00.771
Okay, listen up, kids.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.477
Francesca,
look at me.

13:05.985 --> 13:08.886
You can't tell anyone,
even your friends at school,

13:08.921 --> 13:12.357
that Daddy's home
for a little while.

13:12.391 --> 13:14.552
Are you gonna have to
go back to Afghanistan?

13:15.995 --> 13:19.055
The ClA doesn't tell you
where they'll send you next.

13:19.098 --> 13:21.259
ls it dangerous
to be a spy?

13:21.300 --> 13:23.791
Not as long as nobody
knows who you are.

13:23.836 --> 13:27.237
l'm what they call
''working deep cover.''

13:29.008 --> 13:31.875
That's why,
like l said,

13:31.911 --> 13:35.438
- you gotta keep the secret.
- l won't tell.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.540
- You better not!
- l won't!

13:40.219 --> 13:41.709
l love you guys.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.223
How long till you can
move back in with us?

13:50.262 --> 13:52.560
Just until l straighten
this shit out with Tony.

13:52.598 --> 13:54.623
lt's looking good.

13:56.235 --> 13:58.066
ln a few days
l'll know.

14:00.606 --> 14:03.166
What about counseling
for your problem?

14:03.209 --> 14:05.370
- Have you talked to Father Macken?
- Marie,

14:05.411 --> 14:08.073
l thought l made it clear--
l don't have a problem.

14:08.113 --> 14:10.013
That's over with.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.011
ln fact,

14:13.052 --> 14:15.486
l'm seriously thinking
we should have another kid.

14:15.521 --> 14:19.013
Yo, Dad, check it!

14:22.862 --> 14:24.887
Attaboy, V!

14:39.879 --> 14:41.847
Hello?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.439
Hi.

14:43.482 --> 14:44.972
Fuck you.

14:46.552 --> 14:49.112
- l know, look--
- Not a word, not a note.

14:49.154 --> 14:51.384
- What kind of person are you?
- l'm sorry.

14:51.423 --> 14:54.119
You need help.
You're seriously fucked-up.

14:56.161 --> 14:58.288
l got kids.
l couldn't live without 'em.

14:58.330 --> 14:59.592
Bullshit.

14:59.632 --> 15:02.465
lt was the fucking life
you couldn't live without--

15:02.501 --> 15:04.799
the gambling, the money,
who knows what else.

15:06.772 --> 15:10.538
You're right. l didn't want to drag you
down into this pit l'm in.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.807
Hey, fuck that! Everybody else
is stupid to you, aren't they?

15:13.846 --> 15:15.837
- No.
- You can throw your weight around

15:15.881 --> 15:18.577
down there in fucking Jersey.
Everybody kisses your ass.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.955
- l miss you.
- l don't want to know you.

15:25.991 --> 15:28.892
l don't want to hear your voice.
Don't ever call me again.

15:42.141 --> 15:45.235
Do your bowels just
jam up when you fly?

16:12.471 --> 16:15.031
Hey-yyy!

16:15.074 --> 16:17.508
Hopalong Che-se-dic'.

16:17.543 --> 16:19.477
What do you know?
What do you say?

16:22.448 --> 16:24.814
- How you been?
- Word is you reached out to Tony.

16:26.919 --> 16:30.116
l appreciate you coming out to see me.
How you doin'?

16:31.890 --> 16:34.415
Nicole is choking my balls
with this child support.

16:34.460 --> 16:38.419
l could be looking at
six months in County.

16:38.464 --> 16:41.058
l was wondering if you could
float me 20K at two points...

16:42.501 --> 16:44.696
but maybe now is not
a good time for you.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.637
No. No,
l could do that.

16:46.672 --> 16:49.573
But l'm gonna have to say
two and a half.

16:51.243 --> 16:53.677
Okay. You know
l'm good for it.

16:53.712 --> 16:55.703
Would you stop?

17:11.797 --> 17:13.890
Heard on 1010-WlNS
the tunnel's a parking lot.

17:13.932 --> 17:15.559
l hope you didn't
get caught in that.

17:15.601 --> 17:18.262
You said you were gonna take care
of that fucking finook.

17:18.303 --> 17:21.829
Oh, for Christ's sake. Fucking Vito
again? What the fuck is wrong with you?

17:21.874 --> 17:24.934
He's in town, isn't he?
l was at Marie's the other night.

17:24.977 --> 17:27.775
She played the innocent,
but l could tell she'd seen him.

17:27.813 --> 17:30.008
You're fucking
''Carnac the Great'' now too, huh?

17:30.049 --> 17:32.347
l gotta tell you, Anthony,
if Vito was here

17:32.384 --> 17:34.614
- and you knew about it...
- Fuck this.

17:42.528 --> 17:45.292
l love they let you
smoke here.

17:45.330 --> 17:48.766
l think l should have slept
in a while before hitting the stores.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.962
l told you.

17:51.003 --> 17:54.734
- ls your stomach still upset?
- l put in the fucking memory stick.

17:59.778 --> 18:01.575
l love that sound--
French.

18:01.613 --> 18:03.240
lt's so elegant.

18:04.683 --> 18:06.742
lsn't it?

18:09.988 --> 18:12.980
Nobody fucking knows us here, Ro.
Can you believe that?

18:15.060 --> 18:18.029
All the guidebooks say you should
try and get on the local schedule.

18:18.063 --> 18:21.328
- Did you reset your watch?
- Yes, Napoleon. Jesus.

18:23.402 --> 18:25.870
Eloise and Abelard,
my God!

18:25.904 --> 18:27.895
What?

18:27.940 --> 18:31.671
l would say today the first cultural
stop should be the Louvre.

18:31.710 --> 18:33.507
Again, Remy!

18:33.545 --> 18:35.479
- How do you say ''please''?
- S'il vous plait.

18:35.514 --> 18:37.311
- S'il vous plait.
- And the check please.

18:39.184 --> 18:41.175
l don't know
what the fuck he said.

18:41.220 --> 18:44.018
You keep talking English.
Why don't you try and use your French?

18:44.056 --> 18:46.650
l don't know.
l feel strange.

18:46.692 --> 18:50.355
Me and Tony went to Miami.
He knows like six words in Spanish,

18:50.395 --> 18:52.124
but he was right out there with them

18:52.164 --> 18:54.098
like he was fucking
Ricardo Montalban or something.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.363
Mmm.

18:59.771 --> 19:02.672
l told you we should have
gone towards Rue Dauphine.

19:02.708 --> 19:06.303
God damn it, where's my other glove?
l had it when we went in there.

19:06.345 --> 19:08.074
l'm all turned around.

19:08.113 --> 19:09.978
You had to hurry me
out of that restaurant.

19:10.015 --> 19:14.281
- We're miles from the Louvre.
- Fuck, damn it. l already lost a glove.

19:19.791 --> 19:21.816
Oh my God.

19:25.864 --> 19:28.128
Holy shit.

19:33.472 --> 19:36.703
Look at those clouds.
Paris skies...

19:41.647 --> 19:44.207
Who could have built this?

19:55.894 --> 19:57.794
Look!
Just like ''Charade''!

20:13.178 --> 20:15.738
Make sure you clean
that shit off her tit!

20:15.781 --> 20:19.512
Vito-- Atlantic City,
forget it.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.678
Why the changeup?

20:21.720 --> 20:24.416
l can't keep
fighting Phil on this.

20:24.456 --> 20:26.515
Our businesses
are all entwined.

20:26.558 --> 20:30.085
You gotta pick your battles. You want
your no-show jobs, Vito's gotta go.

20:32.898 --> 20:35.128
lt's the right move, T.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.658
All those weeks
in the hospital,

20:37.703 --> 20:40.103
surgeries, constant pain,
for what?

20:40.138 --> 20:43.266
Come out here and get shot
over something like this?

20:44.309 --> 20:45.970
l'm sorry.

20:46.011 --> 20:48.309
lf Vito wanted to pursue
that lifestyle,

20:48.347 --> 20:50.713
he should have
done so quietly.

20:50.749 --> 20:53.479
He was, wasn't he?

20:55.254 --> 20:57.415
Anyone in particular
you want to give this to?

20:58.957 --> 21:02.358
Carlo had the biggest
problem with it, let him handle it.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.698
lt's Vito's own fault.
Why couldn't he stay

21:07.733 --> 21:09.667
wherever
the fuck he was?

21:11.937 --> 21:14.030
Don't beat yourself up
about this.

21:24.182 --> 21:26.514
l'll tell Carlo
to be at the mall.

21:36.828 --> 21:38.728
Hi, it's me.

21:38.764 --> 21:41.528
l just wanted to let you know that
we got in safe and sound.

21:41.566 --> 21:44.296
Call me back. Remember,
it's six hours ahead.

21:44.336 --> 21:46.395
Miss you.

21:54.146 --> 21:57.741
l notice all these little plaques
all over-- what do they say?

22:00.185 --> 22:02.745
''August 20, 1944.

22:04.456 --> 22:08.483
This man Francois Martine
fought in the Resistance

22:08.527 --> 22:11.018
and the Germans shot him
right here on this spot.''

22:13.098 --> 22:15.066
Phil?

22:15.100 --> 22:17.660
What the fuck did that tailor
do to my Zanella's?

22:17.703 --> 22:20.228
- What?
- My slacks, what!

22:20.272 --> 22:24.072
He's losing his eyesight,
poveret'. Diabetes.

22:24.109 --> 22:27.203
l'll take them to the Korean on my way
to church tomorrow.

22:27.245 --> 22:30.009
l've got a meeting
of Concerned Catholic Mothers.

22:30.048 --> 22:31.811
Tell you the truth,

22:31.850 --> 22:34.182
l almost want to not go
to the meeting.

22:34.219 --> 22:38.019
- Here we go.
- A gay in our own family?

22:38.056 --> 22:41.617
This Protestant minister from Denver
is coming to speak to us tomorrow.

22:41.660 --> 22:43.423
An expert.

22:44.596 --> 22:47.190
l'm so embarrassed
in front of Father.

22:52.704 --> 22:56.196
Father told me Vito doesn't
renounce that lifestyle

22:56.241 --> 22:58.334
- he's damned.
- l know.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.641
- What?
- l know.

23:00.679 --> 23:03.273
Father put it so well
last week.

23:03.315 --> 23:05.579
''There's nothing gay
about hell,'' he said.

23:05.617 --> 23:09.144
That's good. l'm sure he didn't
come up with that himself.

23:10.922 --> 23:13.083
One thing l do know,

23:13.125 --> 23:15.787
Vito has to be made to face
his problem squarely.

25:24.089 --> 25:26.421
Thanks for the ride.

25:26.458 --> 25:30.326
New York's only
classic rock station:

25:30.362 --> 25:33.297
- Q104.3
- Here.

25:33.331 --> 25:35.697
You don't need to do that,
but you're sweet.

25:37.168 --> 25:38.931
Okay.

26:00.492 --> 26:01.857
Yeah?

26:01.893 --> 26:03.861
l was just wondering if
you thought about my offer.

26:03.895 --> 26:07.387
Yeah, l thought, and l need to know
who these Atlantic City contacts are.

26:07.432 --> 26:10.595
Meet me in the mall, 11 :00.
Don't be late.

26:34.960 --> 26:37.019
- Get him up.
- No!

26:37.062 --> 26:39.656
- Come here, come here.
- Shut up.

26:39.698 --> 26:41.825
Don't be moving.
Stop.

27:01.553 --> 27:03.521
You're a fucking disgrace.

27:42.327 --> 27:45.421
...husband comes home
with a duck under his arm, he says,

27:45.463 --> 27:47.488
''This is the pig
l've been fucking.''

27:47.532 --> 27:50.296
The wife says,
''lt's not a pig, it's a duck.''

27:50.335 --> 27:53.202
He says, ''l wasn't
talking to you.''

27:58.677 --> 28:01.669
Vito... he was found
beat to death this morning

28:01.713 --> 28:03.408
in a motel in Fort Lee.

28:03.448 --> 28:06.246
- My cop up there told me.
- Minchia.

28:06.284 --> 28:08.445
Plus the homicide detectives told him

28:08.486 --> 28:10.545
Vito had a pool cue
rammed up his ass.

28:33.244 --> 28:36.441
- Lover's quarrel maybe?
- Look, we all know who did it.

28:36.481 --> 28:39.211
Phil! The fucking balls
on that prick!

28:39.250 --> 28:41.377
What did l always
say about him?

28:47.225 --> 28:49.125
l see you
heard the news.

28:49.160 --> 28:52.357
- That must have been Phil, right?
- ''Jimmy Olsen'' over here.

28:52.397 --> 28:55.423
l know he's out of line, but still,
you kind of have to admire the guy.

28:55.467 --> 28:57.492
lt's not all talk
with him.

29:01.106 --> 29:04.337
l'm just saying he saved us
all a lot of trouble, right?

29:14.319 --> 29:17.584
Can't have been an easy decision,
killing a made guy, huh?

29:17.622 --> 29:21.114
Naturally Phil won't brag
about it 'cause he can't.

29:21.159 --> 29:24.720
Phil was in a tough situation, his
family honor was stained.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.231
lf l got to Vito first,
net result would have been the same.

29:27.265 --> 29:28.926
Fucking-A.

29:38.443 --> 29:40.673
l wish l'd have
borrowed money from Vito.

29:45.316 --> 29:47.341
You know what
this is, right?

29:47.385 --> 29:49.876
lt's not about Vito,
it's about me.

29:49.921 --> 29:52.355
Phil's saying he can do whatever
the fuck he wants,

29:52.390 --> 29:54.551
including kill a captain
in my own family

29:54.592 --> 29:56.890
and l can't do
a fucking thing about it.

29:56.928 --> 29:59.362
lt's always been
partly about that.

29:59.397 --> 30:02.389
Believe me, the vitamins
are just the beginning.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.967
lt's Carmela.

30:12.677 --> 30:15.942
- ls Paris burning?
- Hi, you busy?

30:15.980 --> 30:18.414
No no, just
bullshitting with Sil.

30:18.449 --> 30:20.178
How's it goin'?

30:20.218 --> 30:22.379
Actually it's cold,
raining.

30:22.420 --> 30:25.856
- When it drizzles, huh?
- You're worse than Ro.

30:25.890 --> 30:28.654
l'm going out of my mind
with these pop references.

30:28.693 --> 30:32.026
l am seeing some
incredible things, Tony.

30:32.063 --> 30:34.896
Talk about the History Channel,
you would love it here.

30:34.933 --> 30:37.231
- How's the toast?
- The what?

30:37.268 --> 30:38.997
The French toast?

30:39.037 --> 30:41.597
Actually they call it
something else.

30:41.639 --> 30:44.938
- How's the French fries?
- Pommes allumettes.

30:44.976 --> 30:47.069
- Fuck it.
- Have you heard from Meadow?

30:47.111 --> 30:48.772
More than l
thought.

30:48.813 --> 30:51.475
You realize this kid knows
how to do absolutely nothing?

30:51.516 --> 30:54.451
She was asking if she needed
to get the car serviced regularly

30:54.485 --> 30:56.885
'cause there's no snow
out there.

30:56.921 --> 30:59.719
- How's Prince Albert?
- He'd fit right in over in France.

30:59.757 --> 31:01.884
None of those dipshits
want to work either.

31:01.926 --> 31:04.121
l did get him to hose down
the trash cans though.

31:04.162 --> 31:05.754
That's something.

31:05.797 --> 31:08.732
You're probably busy.
l'll let you go.

31:08.766 --> 31:11.064
l just wanted to say hello.
l miss you.

31:11.102 --> 31:14.196
l miss you too.
Be careful, eh?

31:24.015 --> 31:25.915
People are gonna
expect a response.

31:25.950 --> 31:29.249
See, this is what the fuck
l was talking about.

31:29.287 --> 31:33.087
- We hit one of Phil's guys?
- Joe Bananas went after Carlo Gambino.

31:33.124 --> 31:36.560
Made guys got killed,
the war went seven years.

31:36.594 --> 31:38.255
How many times
do l gotta say this?

31:38.296 --> 31:40.025
When guys are on the mattresses,
they're not out earning.

31:40.064 --> 31:42.726
So? What?

31:48.706 --> 31:51.072
All Phil cares about
is fucking money.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.245
He's got that wire room
in Sheepshead Bay, right?

31:57.282 --> 31:59.682
- Our guys have seen it.
- Yeah.

32:25.977 --> 32:28.104
l live in Las Vegas
six months.

32:28.146 --> 32:30.774
My friend has a restaurant.
l work there.

32:30.815 --> 32:33.545
- l like U.S.A.
- And l like France.

32:34.719 --> 32:36.778
Ro, are you coming
or what?

32:38.957 --> 32:41.482
- Okay, you call me, yeah?
- D'accord.

32:52.170 --> 32:53.694
He lives
in Belleville.

32:53.738 --> 32:56.502
They've got a Belleville
in France.

32:56.541 --> 32:59.101
You're not really gonna
go out with him, are you?

32:59.143 --> 33:01.475
- l mean he's like 26 years old.
- Duh!

33:05.583 --> 33:07.676
God, isn't this pretty?

33:10.188 --> 33:12.850
''1 350 A.D.''

33:12.890 --> 33:16.690
You realize some woman
just like us wore this?

33:17.996 --> 33:20.226
She was probably married,
had children.

33:21.399 --> 33:23.458
''Gallo Roman baths,

33:23.501 --> 33:25.230
third century.''

33:25.269 --> 33:27.737
l wonder what they
got up to there, huh?

33:34.812 --> 33:36.575
This city is so old.

33:36.614 --> 33:39.048
You think about
all the people who have lived here,

33:39.083 --> 33:41.278
generation
after generation,

33:41.319 --> 33:45.085
hundreds and hundreds of years,
all those lives.

33:45.123 --> 33:47.717
God, it's so sad.

33:49.627 --> 33:52.152
l mean, it isn't sad,
l don't know. lt just makes you think,

33:52.196 --> 33:54.630
just makes you look
at yourself differently.

34:03.641 --> 34:07.475
There was this one night in the hospital
when it was very touch-and-go with Tony.

34:07.512 --> 34:09.911
- Mm-hmm.
- He came out of the coma for a minute

34:09.947 --> 34:11.938
and he said, ''Who am l?
Where am l going?''

34:14.652 --> 34:17.246
At the time l didn't know
what he meant.

34:18.688 --> 34:20.782
But coming here,

34:20.824 --> 34:23.418
l feel the same way.
lsn't that odd?

34:23.460 --> 34:25.429
Let me get a picture.

34:30.501 --> 34:32.696
Oh honey, what?

34:32.737 --> 34:34.728
We worry so much.

34:34.772 --> 34:37.366
Sometimes it feels
like that's all we do,

34:37.408 --> 34:40.241
but in the end it just
gets washed away.

34:40.277 --> 34:43.110
All of it just--
just gets washed away.

34:44.549 --> 34:46.641
Come here. Oh.

34:59.564 --> 35:01.725
l know what
the papers are saying,

35:01.766 --> 35:04.826
but the police think it might've
not have been a gay thing.

35:04.869 --> 35:06.598
Marie, honey,

35:06.637 --> 35:10.937
they pick up strangers
in bars and truck stops.

35:10.975 --> 35:14.376
The way they beat him--
oh God, his face.

35:14.412 --> 35:17.108
He didn't even look like
a person anymore.

35:17.148 --> 35:19.514
You can't let
your mind dwell on--

35:21.119 --> 35:23.417
Turn that off!

35:27.625 --> 35:31.288
Aunt Cel' hasn't called.
Not even to talk to the kids.

35:31.329 --> 35:33.422
How could people
be so cruel?

35:33.464 --> 35:36.160
lt is a sin
after all, Marie.

35:36.200 --> 35:39.226
The Church is
very clear on that.

35:39.270 --> 35:41.568
But you're here.
You came.

35:41.606 --> 35:44.268
Father always says
''Hate the sin,

35:44.308 --> 35:47.106
love the sinner.''

35:47.145 --> 35:49.511
l wish l was dead.

35:49.547 --> 35:52.482
l mean it,
l wish l was dead!

35:52.517 --> 35:55.816
You know what?
l'll make the funeral arrangements.

35:55.853 --> 35:58.515
You're in no condition.
Given the circumstances,

35:58.556 --> 36:01.992
a small private service,
just the immediate family.

36:02.026 --> 36:06.122
He was a good man,
wasn't he, Phil?

36:06.164 --> 36:08.724
He was. l loved him like
a brother-in-law.

36:08.766 --> 36:11.826
But God moves
in strange ways.

36:15.173 --> 36:18.836
Our tailor, he's going blind,
47 years old.

36:18.876 --> 36:22.073
Walk in those shoes.

36:23.681 --> 36:27.481
And l gotta think, Marie,
Vito on some level--

36:27.518 --> 36:30.078
maybe it's better for the kids
not to have that role model.

36:42.233 --> 36:45.031
So...

36:45.069 --> 36:47.094
all the women
in your house are gone.

36:53.144 --> 36:56.079
How do you feel about Carmela
taking a trip without you?

36:56.113 --> 36:58.513
Do we really have
to fucking talk about this?

36:58.549 --> 37:01.017
Of course not.

37:03.287 --> 37:06.518
Before we end,
is there anything you'd like to discuss?

37:11.796 --> 37:13.593
Okay.

37:19.203 --> 37:21.262
How about the fact
that l hate my son?

37:22.707 --> 37:24.538
l come home and he's sitting
on the computer

37:24.575 --> 37:26.304
in his fucking
underwear.

37:26.344 --> 37:28.539
Wasting his time
in some chitchat room,

37:28.579 --> 37:31.207
going back and forth
with some other fucking jerkoff,

37:31.249 --> 37:33.217
giggling like
a little schoolgirl.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.685
l want to fucking smash
his fucking face in.

37:38.122 --> 37:40.454
My son.

37:40.491 --> 37:42.550
What do you think
about that?

37:44.195 --> 37:46.720
Anthony, l think
your anger towards AJ

37:46.764 --> 37:48.561
has been building
for some time.

37:50.001 --> 37:52.060
We have to deal
with this.

37:52.103 --> 37:54.367
All l know is it's a good thing
my father's not alive,

37:54.405 --> 37:56.236
because he'd find
this fucking hilarious.

37:56.274 --> 37:57.832
Find what hilarious?

37:57.875 --> 38:00.776
The kind of...
son l produced.

38:00.811 --> 38:03.541
You mean because Anthony
doesn't conform

38:03.581 --> 38:06.209
to your father's idea
of what a man should be?

38:06.250 --> 38:08.878
His, mine or anybody's.

38:12.223 --> 38:14.885
Let me tell you--

38:14.925 --> 38:18.622
if Carmela let me kick AJ's ass like
my father kicked my ass,

38:18.663 --> 38:20.460
he might have grown up
with some balls.

38:20.498 --> 38:23.228
- Like you.
- Yeah, like me.

38:24.468 --> 38:26.333
He might have
also grown up

38:26.370 --> 38:28.270
taking out his anger

38:28.306 --> 38:31.298
at his father's brutality
towards him on others.

38:31.342 --> 38:33.833
He might have grown up
with a desperate need

38:33.878 --> 38:35.743
to dominate and control.

38:37.515 --> 38:41.144
Anthony, we've been
dancing around this for years--

38:41.185 --> 38:43.244
how you live.

38:48.993 --> 38:51.086
What is it you want
from your life?

38:58.469 --> 39:00.903
l couldn't even hit him
if l wanted to,

39:00.938 --> 39:03.600
he's so fucking little.
lt's Carmela's side of the family,

39:03.641 --> 39:05.609
they're small people.
Her father-- you could

39:05.643 --> 39:07.577
knock him over
with a fucking feather.

39:07.611 --> 39:09.636
Okay.

39:12.416 --> 39:14.509
But l have to point out

39:14.552 --> 39:16.816
what you resent Carmela
doing for AJ--

39:16.854 --> 39:19.482
protecting him
from his father--

39:19.523 --> 39:21.388
is the very thing
you had often wished

39:21.425 --> 39:23.222
your mother
had done for you.

39:28.933 --> 39:31.731
l love this fois gras.
l can't get enough.

39:31.769 --> 39:34.533
The presentation alone
gives you calories, but who cares?

39:34.572 --> 39:37.769
We should feel guilty?
We walked our asses off.

39:46.450 --> 39:48.179
Man, you know
what's strange, Ro?

39:48.219 --> 39:50.881
When you go to a place
you've never been before, it's like...

39:50.921 --> 39:53.754
all the people were imaginary
till you got there.

39:53.791 --> 39:57.124
lt's like until you saw them,
they never existed,

39:57.161 --> 39:59.356
and you never
existed to them.

39:59.397 --> 40:02.924
l don't know, maybe you're
more a philosophical person than l am.

40:02.967 --> 40:04.696
No no, it just made me think,
that's all.

40:04.735 --> 40:06.532
You know, it's the same as
when you die--

40:06.570 --> 40:08.697
life goes on
without you.

40:08.739 --> 40:11.572
Like it does in Paris
when we're not here.

40:11.609 --> 40:14.806
Tomorrow we hit
the stores.

40:14.845 --> 40:17.473
- Chloe, Dior.
- A Kelly bag pour moi.

40:22.186 --> 40:24.814
Bordeaux
is so delicious.

40:24.855 --> 40:26.982
When we were
in St. Eustache's

40:27.024 --> 40:28.958
l noticed that
you lit two candles,

40:28.993 --> 40:31.018
for Jackie
and Jackie Jr., right?

40:32.563 --> 40:34.622
You know we never really
talked about that.

40:34.665 --> 40:36.758
- About what?
- About Jackie Jr.

40:36.801 --> 40:39.634
What's there
to talk about?

40:40.638 --> 40:42.105
Madame.

40:44.608 --> 40:47.042
- Oof, Madonn'.
- Pour madame...

41:02.460 --> 41:05.725
- Merci.
- Oh boy!

41:05.763 --> 41:07.788
l didn't mean
to invade, Ro.

41:07.832 --> 41:09.629
lt's just--
l mean, we're friends.

41:09.667 --> 41:11.965
lf there was anything
you wanted to share...

41:15.005 --> 41:16.939
l mean, l-l cannot

41:16.974 --> 41:19.568
begin to imagine
losing a son.

41:23.681 --> 41:26.013
Jesus, Carm.

41:27.451 --> 41:30.682
We're on vacation.
We're having a beautiful dinner.

41:30.721 --> 41:33.155
Why would you
bring this up?

41:34.525 --> 41:36.186
l didn't mean
to upset you, Ro.

41:36.227 --> 41:38.286
l thought because we had
this time together--

41:38.329 --> 41:40.058
lt's fucking morbid,
that's what it is.

41:40.097 --> 41:41.962
l'm sorry, Ro.

41:43.300 --> 41:45.734
He's dead. He's gone.

41:45.769 --> 41:47.896
What can l do about it?

41:47.938 --> 41:49.769
Light a candle.

41:52.710 --> 41:55.144
l picture him
with his dad,

41:55.179 --> 41:57.477
and with his grandma
who he loved,

41:57.515 --> 41:59.574
and with Jesus.

41:59.617 --> 42:01.414
What's the matter
with you?

42:01.452 --> 42:03.511
Why would you bring
New Jersey here?

42:03.554 --> 42:07.012
- Why can't we just have a good time?
- You're right, l apologize.

42:13.697 --> 42:15.790
l'm going out
with Michel tonight.

42:15.833 --> 42:18.267
Okay.

42:23.374 --> 42:26.605
You know, you're welcome
to come, Carm.

42:26.644 --> 42:30.045
- l mean that.
- Thank you, but no. You go.

42:30.080 --> 42:32.071
l want to walk along
the Seine one more time.

42:46.397 --> 42:48.888
We gotta call the exterminator.
These are rat turds.

42:48.933 --> 42:50.730
What time did Patsy
and them say?

42:50.768 --> 42:53.532
There they are!
The pirates of prosciutt',

42:53.571 --> 42:55.971
- the brigands of bracioll'.
- Hey, Dom.

43:00.578 --> 43:03.206
Game out in Canarsie.
l appreciate the rollers you sent.

43:03.247 --> 43:05.943
Linguini fra diav',
you want to stay?

43:05.983 --> 43:08.178
Naw, l gotta stop by
my daughter's in Metuchen.

43:10.454 --> 43:13.048
Hey... sorry to hear
about your boy.

43:14.325 --> 43:16.384
Uh-huh.

43:16.427 --> 43:18.861
Terrible thing.

43:18.896 --> 43:21.797
Son 1 3, daughter
nine years old.

43:23.133 --> 43:25.795
Syracuse--
tanked again.

43:30.341 --> 43:32.536
That pool cue--
l wonder if it was chalked.

43:32.576 --> 43:35.909
Very funny, Dom.
Very cute.

43:35.946 --> 43:39.040
l don't quite get it,
but cute.

43:39.083 --> 43:41.950
Hey, you know the autopsy
found a three ball in his side pocket?

43:41.986 --> 43:44.250
- You're on a run.
- They found a hankie

43:44.288 --> 43:47.257
with Carlo's lipstick
in his other pocket.

43:47.291 --> 43:50.021
l'm just breaking balls.

43:50.060 --> 43:53.257
You're right though--
shouldn't laugh about a tragedy.

43:59.470 --> 44:01.734
That old homo actor--
Ramon Navarro?

44:01.772 --> 44:04.297
He had an ivory dildo
stuck up his ass when they found him.

44:04.341 --> 44:07.333
Pretty up on all this shit,
huh, Dom?

44:07.378 --> 44:10.313
Come to think of it,
he was from Jersey too.

44:10.347 --> 44:11.837
What'd they find
up your mother's cunt?

44:11.882 --> 44:14.248
Time to hit the trail
for Metuchen, huh, what do you say?

44:14.284 --> 44:15.979
My mistake.

44:16.020 --> 44:17.749
Carlo's lipstick
was on Vito's cock.

44:19.156 --> 44:20.851
Hit him!
Hit that prick!

44:20.891 --> 44:23.359
No, Carlo!

44:23.394 --> 44:25.225
Carlo!

44:27.431 --> 44:29.194
Get him off me!

44:31.001 --> 44:32.628
How's that, you fuck?

44:32.670 --> 44:34.570
Olé!

44:56.026 --> 44:58.256
Fuck!

45:07.171 --> 45:09.366
Call Patsy and them,

45:09.406 --> 45:12.307
say we had to leave...
a pipe broke.

45:13.677 --> 45:16.009
We wait till the store closes,
we get him out.

45:16.046 --> 45:18.844
Cut him up
in the work area?

45:20.217 --> 45:22.117
No more of that.

45:22.152 --> 45:24.347
Uh, DNA.

45:26.290 --> 45:28.190
Ditch his car,

45:28.225 --> 45:30.125
get some biangaleen.

45:53.650 --> 45:55.083
Sil!

45:56.253 --> 45:58.084
Come on, open the door!

45:58.122 --> 46:01.853
- Shit.
- Hello, anybody in there?

46:06.029 --> 46:07.792
Ton', you don't want
to come in here.

46:07.831 --> 46:10.061
- Get back in your car, go for a ride.
- What?

46:14.938 --> 46:17.031
Fat Dom Gamiello
came over,

46:17.074 --> 46:20.066
you know, just to break balls
re Vito,

46:20.110 --> 46:21.702
Carlo...

46:23.514 --> 46:26.108
Sil hit him
first.

46:33.957 --> 46:35.788
Tony,
let me just--

46:37.895 --> 46:40.420
That's right, Ton', you go.
You don't know nothin'.

46:40.464 --> 46:43.797
You were right. They kill a made guy,
this is what happens.

46:43.834 --> 46:46.564
Say hello to Gab.
Tell her l hope she's over the flu.

46:46.603 --> 46:48.468
Goddamn Vito!

47:24.508 --> 47:27.068
What's the hardest thing
about skateboarding?

47:27.110 --> 47:30.238
l give up. What's the hardest thing
about skateboarding?

47:30.280 --> 47:32.578
Telling your parents
you're gay.

47:36.286 --> 47:38.254
Signore.

47:38.288 --> 47:39.721
l thought you were
going out for dinner.

47:39.756 --> 47:41.986
See you in the garage
a minute?

47:48.999 --> 47:50.728
What now?

47:50.767 --> 47:52.962
Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.m.
You go to this address.

47:53.003 --> 47:55.267
You ask for
a Mr. Caravalho.

47:55.305 --> 47:58.240
- l just got off the phone with him.
- At 7:00 in the morning?!

47:58.275 --> 48:00.573
- For what?
- You're gonna be working construction.

48:00.611 --> 48:02.943
- What?
- Ferrying cement in a wheelbarrow.

48:02.980 --> 48:06.245
- So, it's outdoors?
- Yeah.

48:06.283 --> 48:08.376
Well, it's wintertime.

48:08.418 --> 48:09.783
You've got a lot of those hooded
sweatshirts--

48:09.820 --> 48:12.721
like the mulignans wear
that you watch on MTV.

48:12.756 --> 48:15.316
- You can double up.
- Come on, this is bullshit.

48:20.063 --> 48:23.191
Every penny you make, you keep.
We won't charge you any rent.

48:23.233 --> 48:25.599
And believe me, the pay is good.
lt's a union job.

48:28.071 --> 48:31.063
l just want
to see you do good.

48:31.108 --> 48:33.736
You're my son
and l love you.

48:37.648 --> 48:39.582
Look, l 'm just gonna
have to leave your friend

48:39.616 --> 48:41.208
in the lurch
when l go back to school.

48:41.251 --> 48:43.412
That's okay, he deals
with that all the time.

48:44.521 --> 48:46.648
l'd just as soon
keep searching online.

48:46.690 --> 48:48.920
l'm sure you would,

48:48.959 --> 48:51.359
but if you're not at that site
tomorrow morning,

48:51.395 --> 48:53.329

52:08.425 --> 52:10.359

''--told reporters that
