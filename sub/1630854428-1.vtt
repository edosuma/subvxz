-I can do this all day, Missy.
I've survived worse than you.

01:34.398 --> 01:36.531
-And I can hold a tree pose
for two hours.

01:36.574 --> 01:38.663
Don't fuck with me, old man.

Allen doesn't mess around

You should see his needlepoint.
-It grounds me.

for bargaining.

02:15.744 --> 02:17.572

03:15.717 --> 03:17.980
So, yeah, go out there
and ruin some dicks.

03:18.023 --> 03:21.418
-Wow. I'm changing the subject.
How are my baby girls?

03:21.462 --> 03:24.334
-They suck.
Don't ever have kids.

03:24.378 --> 03:27.250
-Oh, no.
What happened this time?

03:27.294 --> 03:28.599
-I came home with a Frosty,

03:28.643 --> 03:30.253
but it had
a plastic straw in it.

03:30.297 --> 03:32.821
And the girl starts screaming
at me like, I don't know,

03:32.864 --> 03:35.258
I murdered a sea turtle
in front of her own children.

03:35.302 --> 03:37.434
-Oh. How was the Frosty?

03:37.478 --> 03:39.741
-Oh, so worth murdering
that sea turtle.

03:39.784 --> 03:41.133
-Alright, let's go up
to my place.

03:41.177 --> 03:42.352
I want to change
out of these work clothes.

03:42.396 --> 03:44.180
-How was work, by the way?

03:44.224 --> 03:46.661
Did you make any big deals
with any big-deal celebrities?

03:46.704 --> 03:48.228
-Who cares?
I don't want to talk about work.

03:48.271 --> 03:49.751
-Yeah. I don't care.
I was just being nice.

03:49.794 --> 03:51.231
-That's what I thought.

03:51.274 --> 03:52.623
-Remember that girl
I was dating, Cleo?

03:52.667 --> 03:54.625
-Yes.
-We dated for three months.

03:54.669 --> 03:56.279
And when we broke up,
she lit my shoes on fire?

03:56.323 --> 03:59.108
My fucking Georges, man.
My 23s. You remember that shit?

03:59.151 --> 04:00.544
-I said I remember.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.416
-You date a girl
for, like, five years.

04:02.459 --> 04:04.983
And when you break up, there's
no fight, no blowout, nothing.

04:05.027 --> 04:08.378
-Yeah, but we never fought, man.
You know this.

04:08.422 --> 04:10.075
We just sat down
and talked about it

04:10.119 --> 04:13.209
and decided it wasn't working
out, so we called it.

04:13.253 --> 04:16.343
I don't see what is so hard to
understand about that.

04:16.386 --> 04:19.607
-Because it doesn't make sense.
Do you understand this?

04:19.650 --> 04:22.871
-I don't.
but I am willing to learn.

04:24.481 --> 04:26.701
I don't know why I said that.

04:26.744 --> 04:29.704
-Luckily, it won't be necessary
for the job, William.

04:29.747 --> 04:31.314
-Disagree.

04:31.358 --> 04:33.882
You've got to teach this
to all men everywhere, right?

04:33.925 --> 04:37.015
-Yes. Y-Yes.

04:37.059 --> 04:39.975
-Well, I think that concludes
the interview.

04:40.018 --> 04:43.108
-Okay. Thank you so much again
for the opportunity.

04:43.152 --> 04:46.460
I'm a really big fan
of you guys, so, you know,

04:46.503 --> 04:47.809
I would kill to work with you.

04:47.852 --> 04:49.593
I mean, not literally,
obviously,

04:49.637 --> 04:51.769
but, like, you know.
-Not literally?

04:51.813 --> 04:53.858
-What?

04:56.600 --> 04:58.863
-He's fucking with you, Willie.
Fucking with you, man.

04:58.907 --> 05:00.561
Hey, look,
you did a good job, man.

05:00.604 --> 05:02.824
Alright, let us talk it over
and we'll get back to you.

05:02.867 --> 05:05.392
-Thanks again. Thank you.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.350
-Watch the chair.
-Yes, right.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.047
-I dig him.

05:09.091 --> 05:10.788
He's like a chocolate
Clark Kent,

05:10.832 --> 05:12.834
and his work is impressive.

05:12.877 --> 05:15.837
-Yeah, he's a little green,
though, right?

05:15.880 --> 05:19.014
-So? I say we hire him.
We need some young blood

05:19.057 --> 05:21.364
if we're gonna be collaborating
with Uniformity L.A.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.932
Don't give me that, "Oh, well,
we need to talk about it."

05:23.975 --> 05:26.151
Look, I'm telling you,
I see a huge opportunity.

05:26.195 --> 05:29.154
They be making moves in the
interior-design space, bro.

05:29.198 --> 05:30.504
-Yeah, I hear you, man.

05:30.547 --> 05:32.767
Can we just pump the brakes
a little?

05:32.810 --> 05:34.464
It's kind of a lot right now.

05:34.508 --> 05:37.859
Maybe I can think about it
over the holidays. Is that cool?

05:37.902 --> 05:40.775
-Totally fine. It can wait.

05:40.818 --> 05:42.167
-Thank you.

05:42.211 --> 05:45.257
Now...
can we please get me a drink?

05:45.301 --> 05:47.129
-You ain't said nothing
but a word.

05:47.172 --> 05:48.696
Let's get the fuck out of here
and get drunk.

05:48.739 --> 05:50.654
-Right. It's the holidays.

05:50.698 --> 05:51.960
So that should give you
plenty of time

05:52.003 --> 05:53.527
to work out
your best and final offer

05:53.570 --> 05:55.006
because if we start the new year

05:55.050 --> 05:56.834
and you haven't met
my client's demands,

05:56.878 --> 05:58.793
she will be taking
the studio gig.

05:58.836 --> 06:01.012
Okay? Merry Christmas.

06:02.927 --> 06:05.147
Done. Officially done.

06:05.190 --> 06:07.279
Ahh, now I just need
my cocktail.

06:07.323 --> 06:10.370
Mason works Friday nights,
and he makes the best --

06:10.413 --> 06:11.762
What? What?

06:11.806 --> 06:14.417
-Nothing.
-Something.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.941
-It's not gonna be
the easiest garment to take off.

06:16.985 --> 06:19.030
-Oh, Jesus, Chels.

06:19.074 --> 06:22.077
-Are you a nun or something?

06:22.120 --> 06:24.035
Hey, did you get
on a dating app finally?

06:24.079 --> 06:27.169
-Yes, but I haven't
checked it yet.

06:27.212 --> 06:29.606
-What? Whip that shit out.

06:29.650 --> 06:32.740
-Fine.
Here, you can look.

06:32.783 --> 06:35.525
-Wow.
A lot of power.

06:35.569 --> 06:38.789
Nina, you have 50 messages.

06:38.833 --> 06:40.312
-Really?
-50.

06:40.356 --> 06:42.967
-Oh, my...Oh, come on.
They're just --

06:43.011 --> 06:45.143
They're all trying
so hard, though.

06:45.187 --> 06:47.711
Like this dude. He's got
better eyebrows than I do.

06:47.755 --> 06:49.800
-You know, I appreciate that.
It means he manscapes.

06:49.844 --> 06:52.237
Wait. Whoa.

06:52.281 --> 06:55.153
Look at this guy, Alexander.
Hello!

06:55.197 --> 06:57.895
-Is that a real person?
-He is delicious.

06:57.939 --> 07:00.202
Yes! There she is.
There's my little vixen.

07:00.245 --> 07:02.073
-Alright, settle down. Okay?

07:02.117 --> 07:04.902
You know what?
This is great right here.

07:04.946 --> 07:06.904
Thank you so much.

07:06.948 --> 07:10.342
-Hey, Nina! Nina!
Stop living in denial.

07:10.386 --> 07:12.693
-Denial of what?
-Dick.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.216
You're living in dick denial.

07:14.259 --> 07:16.566
-Wow. I can't with you.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

07:16.610 --> 07:18.394
Stop. Listen.
Real talk.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.788
I spend my life buried
under two little demons

07:20.831 --> 07:24.748
who are sucking me of my
life force every given second.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.489
I love my husband.
You know I love my husband,

07:26.533 --> 07:28.578
but he's basically just a pile
of foreskin at this point.

07:28.622 --> 07:29.971
By the way,
Dex isn't circumcised.

07:30.014 --> 07:31.407
I can't believe
I never told you that.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.061
It's a really long,
infuriating story.

07:33.104 --> 07:35.193
Anyway, look, I don't mean to be
that psychic friend

07:35.237 --> 07:36.630
who's like,
"Yes, girl, get laid

07:36.673 --> 07:38.414
so I could live vicariously
through you."

07:38.458 --> 07:39.676
But, yes, girl, get laid

07:39.720 --> 07:41.635
so I can live vicariously
through you.

07:41.678 --> 07:42.940
I need this, okay?

07:42.984 --> 07:45.813
I need something
to make me feel alive.

07:45.856 --> 07:48.380
No one sucks on my tits anymore,
which is a shame,

07:48.424 --> 07:50.295
because I was an "A"
before I got pregnant.

07:50.339 --> 07:52.907
And now I'm a "G"
and it's a waste!

07:52.950 --> 07:55.518
Please, I need you to help me.

07:55.562 --> 07:58.521
And you can by boning the shit
out of that guy

07:58.565 --> 08:01.219
and giving me every detail.

08:01.263 --> 08:03.700
-Should I just film it for you?
-Oh, my God.

08:03.744 --> 08:06.224
I wouldn't say no to that.
-Oh, wow.

08:06.268 --> 08:07.878
-Oh, you were joking?

08:07.922 --> 08:09.401
I mean, it seems reasonable.
I'm your best friend.

08:09.445 --> 08:12.535
-How much do you love me?
-It depends. Why?

08:12.579 --> 08:15.233
-Well, it's just my girl,
Angela's, coming over

08:15.277 --> 08:18.193
your house on Sunday,
and she's bringing a friend --

08:18.236 --> 08:19.586
a recently single friend.

08:19.629 --> 08:21.762
-Oh, shit.
I forgot to tell you.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.372
We're watching football
at Nina's.

08:23.415 --> 08:24.678
-Nina's?
-Yeah.

08:24.721 --> 08:26.418
-Wait.

08:26.462 --> 08:29.030
Please don't tell me
you gave her the flat screen.

08:29.073 --> 08:32.555
-Game day's her thing.
It makes sense.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.688
-Hey, man,
none of this makes sense.

08:34.731 --> 08:37.734
-I'm not gonna hate-bang some
guy to get over Allen. Okay?

08:37.778 --> 08:39.693
-Oh, my God.
Why the hell not?

08:39.736 --> 08:41.259
-Because there's nothing
to get over.

08:41.303 --> 08:43.392
-It's a gorgeous piece
of human innovation.

08:43.435 --> 08:45.437
-It's easy. We just...

08:45.481 --> 08:47.396
-Let me guess.
You talked it out.

08:47.439 --> 08:48.745
-Hey, Mason.
-You can be an adult...

08:48.789 --> 08:50.921
-What's up, Nina?
First time without...

08:50.965 --> 08:53.097
-Hey, Mason!
-Allen?

08:55.273 --> 08:57.362
-Ew. What the fuck
are they doing here?

08:57.406 --> 08:59.060
-Oh, sh...

09:02.846 --> 09:04.761
-Yeah.
And so when your order comes up,

09:04.805 --> 09:06.241
you just grab your food here.

09:06.284 --> 09:08.112
If you have any questions,
just ask Elena.

09:08.156 --> 09:09.461
Oops.
-Oopsies.

09:09.505 --> 09:11.072
-Oopsies.
Elena runs the kitchen.

09:11.115 --> 09:13.988
Elena. Elena.

09:14.031 --> 09:15.772
New server, Autumn.
Autumn. Elena.

09:15.816 --> 09:19.210
-Hi.
I love your apron.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.476
-Oh. She's shy.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.522
-Excuse me.
I just have one quick question.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.871
-Yeah?
-Sorry. Do --

09:27.915 --> 09:29.307
Do a lot of celebrities
come in here?

09:29.351 --> 09:31.135
-I mean...yes.

09:31.179 --> 09:33.834
-Shh, shh, shh.

09:33.877 --> 09:36.401
We do not think of them
as celebrities per se.

09:36.445 --> 09:38.490
They're customers,
just like everybody else. Yeah?

09:38.534 --> 09:41.885
-It's just that, um,
I'm a singer...

09:41.929 --> 09:43.887
-Oh, no.
-...and I act, too.

09:43.931 --> 09:45.410
And my cousin says
that I have the perfect

09:45.454 --> 09:46.847
complexion for the screen.

09:46.890 --> 09:50.981
And he is an influencer
and a pastor.

09:51.025 --> 09:53.375
-Okay. Look, I am aware
that most people working here

09:53.418 --> 09:56.334
are pursuing other passions,
but I just want my employees

09:56.378 --> 09:58.641
to keep their pursuits
to themselves.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.687
I don't want to come across
like a...

10:00.730 --> 10:03.254
-Like a biscuit boy.
-...lame-o.

10:03.298 --> 10:06.649
But, you know,
I run a tight ship. Yeah?

10:06.693 --> 10:08.564
-Captain.
-Dick! What the fuck?

10:08.608 --> 10:09.870
-Jaz. Hey.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.654
-I ain't working the bar
on New Year's?

10:11.698 --> 10:14.048
-Oh, just because Mason covered
your shift last week.

10:14.091 --> 10:15.919
And so since he did us
a favor...

10:15.963 --> 10:17.660
-Bullshit, that's my shift,
and you know it.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.575
-Okay, maybe we could talk it
over with Mason and see...

10:19.619 --> 10:22.970
-You're the manager.
Change it.

10:23.013 --> 10:25.233
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm the manager.
-Good!

10:25.276 --> 10:26.626
Who are you?

10:26.669 --> 10:28.976
-Oh, hi. I'm Autumn.
I love your shirt.

10:29.019 --> 10:31.021
-Of course you do.
It's fucking adorable.

10:31.065 --> 10:32.762
You from Florida?
-How'd you know?

10:32.806 --> 10:34.111
-Low-rider jeans, baby.

10:34.155 --> 10:35.983
-Oh.
-They're Silvers.

10:36.026 --> 10:38.072
-They're jeans.
-Wow. Silvers.

10:38.115 --> 10:40.291
-Maybe I should get her some.
-Don't do that.

10:40.335 --> 10:42.642
Tyler.
Everything okay?

10:42.685 --> 10:44.382
-We might have a problem.

10:44.426 --> 10:45.949
-I'm not going anywhere.

10:45.993 --> 10:49.344
-Uh, yes, you are.
This is my bar.

10:49.387 --> 10:52.782
And I brought Chelsea out for us
to have a good time tonight

10:52.826 --> 10:54.566
so you and Milan
can go somewhere else.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.046
-Well, that sounds lovely.

10:56.090 --> 10:58.483
And that's actually why Milan
and I are here

10:58.527 --> 11:00.442
because this is actually my bar.

11:00.485 --> 11:03.706
What makes you think that?

11:03.750 --> 11:06.709
-Maybe because I found it,
so I have first dibs.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.102
-That's hilarious.

11:08.145 --> 11:09.973
You stopped in
to take a piss, Allen.

11:10.017 --> 11:12.236
You were literally
just following your dick.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.762
-Right. My dick found it first,
and I'm attached to my dick.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.415
-Boom.
-What am I looking at?

11:17.459 --> 11:20.941
-Didn't you hear?
Allen and Nina broke up.

11:20.984 --> 11:23.683
-Oh, no, man.
They're so great together.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.119
-And now they're over there
trying to see

11:25.162 --> 11:27.817
who gets to stay a regular here.
-They famous?

11:27.861 --> 11:30.907
-No. This is Autumn,
our new server.

11:30.951 --> 11:32.169
This is Tyler,
head of security.

11:32.213 --> 11:33.693
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:33.736 --> 11:37.305
-Not famous. Just two
of our favorite regulars.

11:37.348 --> 11:39.524
-Allen, you know how much
I love this place.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.048
Why can't you just
let me have it?

11:41.091 --> 11:42.702
-I love it here, too.

11:42.745 --> 11:44.355
And I let you have everything,

11:44.399 --> 11:46.053
including the 80-inch
flat screen.

11:46.096 --> 11:47.619
-I didn't ask you for things
that you cared about,

11:47.663 --> 11:51.275
like the bar cart or tools
or the surfboards.

11:51.319 --> 11:53.495
-Those are literally things
you never use.

11:53.538 --> 11:55.279
And by the way,
who doesn't care about

11:55.323 --> 11:57.064
an 80-inch flat screen.

11:57.107 --> 11:59.457
-Milan.
-What's up, Chelsea?

11:59.501 --> 12:02.199
-Still vegan?
-Only on the weekdays.

12:02.243 --> 12:04.506
I'm Keto starting Fridays
at 5:00 p.m.

12:04.549 --> 12:06.508
-I want my bar.
-What?

12:06.551 --> 12:09.729
-I said I'm Keto starting
Fridays at 5:00 p.m.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.252
Keto. You heard Keto?

12:11.295 --> 12:12.688
-Yeah.
No, I heard what you said.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.646
-They even named
a cocktail after me.

12:14.690 --> 12:16.170
-Yes, as a joke.

12:16.213 --> 12:18.694
Because you made changes
every time you ordered it.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.914
-Hmm. It needs more gin.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.698
Oh, my God. Too much gin.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.178
Do you use fresh lemon?

12:24.221 --> 12:26.093
Mm. There it is.

12:26.136 --> 12:29.139
There it is.
There it is.

12:29.183 --> 12:32.186
-You're so oblivious, you don't
even realize you're saying it.

12:32.229 --> 12:34.318
It's amazing.
Ask Mason.

12:35.972 --> 12:39.454
-Okay. Well, at least
it's not as bad as the Allen.

12:39.497 --> 12:41.282
-Oh, very convenient.

12:41.325 --> 12:43.763
What, pray tell, is the Allen?

12:43.806 --> 12:45.503
-Your hugs.
-My hugs?

12:45.547 --> 12:49.551
What's wrong with my hugs?
I'm from Montana. We hug.

12:49.594 --> 12:53.773
-Yeah, but yours are weird.
Like creepy-uncle weird.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.296
-Unh.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.039
Unh.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.693
Unh.

13:03.565 --> 13:06.002
-Wait. That's creepy?
-Oh, yeah.

13:06.046 --> 13:09.527
-But it's just a goodbye squeeze
to let you know the hug's over.

13:09.571 --> 13:12.748
-Or you can let go
like human people do.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.185
-Talk about oblivious.
-You know what?

13:15.229 --> 13:17.840
If you and Chelsea want to paint
the town red

13:17.884 --> 13:19.624
in your fancy skydive outfit,

13:19.668 --> 13:22.192
why don't you just go
to the Saddle Ranch?

13:22.236 --> 13:24.281
-Well, why don't you and Milan
go troll for sluts

13:24.325 --> 13:26.544
at a nightclub
in your decade-old dad jeans?

13:26.588 --> 13:29.025
-Okay, I think you need to --
-Tell me to calm down, Allen.

13:29.069 --> 13:30.853
I fucking dare you.
-I'm just saying,

13:30.897 --> 13:33.029
I think you probably need...
-Okay. Okay. Okay.

13:33.073 --> 13:36.859
Okay. Okay, uh, that's enough.

13:36.903 --> 13:39.122
Let's go to the patio.

13:39.166 --> 13:40.820
-What?
-You heard the man.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.430
-No. Guys, we're open.
Someone has to watch the bar.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.040
-New girl, you ever
bartend before?

13:44.084 --> 13:46.651
-I'm a fast learner.
-Good enough for me. Let's go.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.131
-No.
Maybe you should work for me.

13:48.175 --> 13:50.046
-Patio.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.832
Everybody off to the patio.
-No free pouring.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.224
-Anybody need anything?

13:56.444 --> 13:58.011
Ah, okay.

13:58.054 --> 13:59.534
-Alright, guys.
We love you both.

13:59.577 --> 14:01.057
So let's figure something out.

14:01.101 --> 14:03.494
Tyler, you are the mediator.
What do you got?

14:03.538 --> 14:05.279
-It feels best to find
a compromise

14:05.322 --> 14:07.759
that serves both.

14:07.803 --> 14:11.067
I say we make a team effort
and we all toss our solution.

14:11.111 --> 14:13.548
There are no bad ideas.
I'll start.

14:13.591 --> 14:18.118
How about if we divide up times,
switch up nights?

14:18.161 --> 14:20.120
-We're not quibbling
over visitation rights.

14:20.163 --> 14:21.773
It's a fucking bar, not a kid.

14:21.817 --> 14:23.645
-Okay, then, well,
what if we let the staff vote?

14:23.688 --> 14:25.342
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

14:25.386 --> 14:27.083
That might put my staff
in an uncomfortable position.

14:27.127 --> 14:28.693
-I'm fine with it. You guys?
-Yeah.

14:28.737 --> 14:30.913
-Okay, then. Maybe anonymously.
Secret ballots.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.306
-Count 'em up.
-Okay, great.

14:32.349 --> 14:34.351
All those in favor
of my man Allen staying?

14:34.395 --> 14:37.528
-Allen!

14:37.572 --> 14:39.095
-Wh--
-Don't guilt my golf buddy.

14:39.139 --> 14:41.054
-Okay. Why the fuck
did you vote for him?

14:41.097 --> 14:42.577
-Oh, it's financial.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.318
I clean him up every month
on poker night.

14:44.361 --> 14:45.972
-Thanks, Jaz.
-Thank you, Allen.

14:46.015 --> 14:49.279
-Okay. Okay,
everyone for Nina.

14:49.323 --> 14:51.325
-Sorry, Allen.
-It's okay.

14:51.368 --> 14:53.022
Nina introduced him to his wife.

14:54.545 --> 14:55.938
-Where did she just come from?

14:55.982 --> 14:57.853
-Niners fans ride
and die together.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.073
-Okay, well, that leaves Dick.

15:00.116 --> 15:01.944
What say you?

15:01.988 --> 15:03.250
-Yeah.

15:03.293 --> 15:04.729
-I...Well, I...

15:06.775 --> 15:08.037
It's against company policy.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.040
-Hey. Sorry to bother you.

15:11.084 --> 15:14.348
Mason, what is in a Cape Cod?
-It's a vodka cran.

15:14.391 --> 15:17.090
-What? Why don't they
just ask for that?

15:17.133 --> 15:19.614
-Welcome to Los Angeles.
-Okay.

15:19.657 --> 15:22.747
Oh, were you all doing
the best of three?

15:22.791 --> 15:24.358
-What the hell's
the best of three?

15:24.401 --> 15:27.317
-Oh.
So at my last bar job in Tampa,

15:27.361 --> 15:29.232
there would be lots
of bar fights and stuff.

15:29.276 --> 15:30.930
So the owner would just have
people do

15:30.973 --> 15:32.975
a best of three competition,
and the loser was 86'd.

15:33.019 --> 15:35.760
Anyway, have fun.

15:37.719 --> 15:41.418
-That might fly down in Florida,
but not here. Right?

15:41.462 --> 15:44.378
-Also not very fair to Nina.

15:44.421 --> 15:47.294
-And why is that?

15:47.337 --> 15:50.297
-'Cause I was literally
a college athlete.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.605
You played baseball
at a D-3 school.

15:54.649 --> 15:59.175
Okay? I'm an attorney.
I fight for a living. Bring it.

15:59.219 --> 16:01.177
-Okay.
Fine. Let's do this.

16:01.221 --> 16:03.049
-Okay. Okay, guys, guys, guys,
wait, wait, wait.

16:03.092 --> 16:05.181
Let's just take a second here.
Okay?

16:05.225 --> 16:06.704
Look, I am thinking
of a number 1 through 11.

16:06.748 --> 16:09.316
-You know, they have been
coming here for years.

16:09.359 --> 16:10.752
-Ohh.
-Seems fair.

16:10.795 --> 16:12.232
Tyler, what do you say?

16:12.275 --> 16:14.147
-It does sound like
a balanced approach.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.845
-Well, who am I to argue, then?
-Okay. Okay. Okay.

16:16.888 --> 16:20.109
I see what's happening here.
But this is a business.

16:20.153 --> 16:22.633
I'm sorry, but the answer is no.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.637
-And that's my final word.

16:37.257 --> 16:39.172
How does it work?

16:41.522 --> 16:43.654
-First we have people write
down challenges

16:43.698 --> 16:46.396
for Tina and Dan.
-Nina and Allen.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.878
-Then put them in a hat,
mix them up.

16:49.921 --> 16:52.576
Flip a coin, see who goes first.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.361
-Y'all are serious.

16:56.232 --> 16:58.452
-The winner gets to pick
the first challenge

16:58.495 --> 17:01.977
and whoever wins best two
out of three gets to stay.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.806
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.
-Ladies first.

17:08.244 --> 17:10.551
Big Wheel races.
-Yes!

17:10.594 --> 17:13.902
Yes!
-You!

17:13.945 --> 17:15.991
-Wait. What's that?

17:16.035 --> 17:18.211
-Haven't you been here before?
-Oh, no, I'm sorry.

17:18.254 --> 17:19.951
I've been busy keeping
two people alive

17:19.995 --> 17:21.910
for the past six years,

17:21.953 --> 17:23.868
so I don't have time to fuck
around all weekend like you.

17:23.912 --> 17:25.435
-You could've just said
you haven't seen it.

17:25.479 --> 17:28.482
Damn. I guess I'm gonna go
fuck myself over here.

17:28.525 --> 17:30.614
-It's a race.
One lap around the bar

17:30.658 --> 17:33.487
and then you chug
a beer in that.

17:35.706 --> 17:38.709
-Oh, Jesus.
I have been missing out.

17:38.753 --> 17:40.711
-Well, then let me
get you up to speed,

17:40.755 --> 17:45.020
because this here is my thing
and Nina knows it.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.761
-Okay, well, whatever.

17:46.804 --> 17:48.676
I get to choose our drink.

17:48.719 --> 17:50.591
None of your IPA nonsense.

17:50.634 --> 17:52.506
-Whatever helps take the sting
out of your defeat.

17:52.549 --> 17:55.465
-Huh? Huh. Say it again,
say it again.

17:55.509 --> 17:57.989
-Alright.

18:01.819 --> 18:03.821
-Good luck, homie.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.606
-Do I look like I need luck?

18:07.521 --> 18:09.871
-You okay?
You need me to kill anyone?

18:09.914 --> 18:12.134
-No, I got a couple of tricks
up my sleeve.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.396
-Ooh.

18:15.659 --> 18:18.184
-I'm good.
-Okay, bye.

18:18.227 --> 18:19.881
-Go, team!
-Alright, here we go.

18:19.924 --> 18:21.361
One lap, one beer.

18:21.404 --> 18:23.667
Are you ready?
-Your fly's down, Allen.

18:23.711 --> 18:26.540
-Get set, go!
-Sure it is.

18:36.811 --> 18:38.769
-When did you know
my fly was down?

18:38.813 --> 18:41.816
-When you came through the door,
you lumbering dipshit!

18:41.859 --> 18:43.905
-Gentle, gentle, gentle.

18:51.347 --> 18:54.350
-[Voice distorted
Someone needs to be done!

18:55.308 --> 18:57.962
-Here we go, Nina.

18:58.006 --> 19:00.530
-Come on.

19:00.574 --> 19:03.620
-Oh!
-Ha ha!

19:03.664 --> 19:05.274
Yeah! Yeah!

19:05.318 --> 19:07.842
Oh! Whoo!

19:07.885 --> 19:09.887
-I'm trying, Tyler!

19:19.462 --> 19:21.421
-Cheers, darlin'.

19:23.510 --> 19:25.381
-Oh, come on, man.

19:25.425 --> 19:27.818
-Something wrong, Allen?

19:27.862 --> 19:29.733
-Cider.

19:29.777 --> 19:33.824
-Yeah, that's right.
Hard cider.

19:33.868 --> 19:35.478
-Oh, my God. I love this.

19:35.522 --> 19:38.220
I have no idea what's happening,
but I fucking love this.

19:38.264 --> 19:40.527
-Did I ever tell you about
the Thanksgiving Day massacre?

19:40.570 --> 19:41.919
-You did not.

19:41.963 --> 19:44.357
-Oh, fuck.
-Fuck.

19:44.400 --> 19:47.751
-This is a bad idea, Allen.

19:47.795 --> 19:49.927
-What? It's just cider.

19:49.971 --> 19:52.756
Consider it my dessert.

19:52.800 --> 19:56.020
-Yeah. This is a day
for gluttony.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.848
-Oh!
-Oh!

19:57.892 --> 20:00.068
-Boom!

20:01.591 --> 20:03.506
-Oh!
-Oh!

20:03.550 --> 20:06.117
-Game over, bitch.
-Why? Why?

20:06.161 --> 20:07.467
-She got both balls
in the same cup!

20:07.510 --> 20:08.903
She wins!
You got to drink 'em all!

20:08.946 --> 20:12.036
-Drink up.
-Happy Thanksgiving, Allen.

20:13.951 --> 20:17.520
Told you I had some tricks
up my sleeve. Cheers, Allen.

20:17.564 --> 20:18.956
-Go! Go!

20:19.000 --> 20:21.263
Take control, man.
It's all in your head.

20:21.307 --> 20:23.004
-Go! Go, Nina.
You can do this.

20:23.047 --> 20:24.310
You can do this. Go.

20:24.353 --> 20:25.659
-It's so sweet.
Why is it so sweet?

20:25.702 --> 20:27.530
-Stop fucking talk and drink!

20:27.574 --> 20:29.619
Chug! Chug! Chug!
-Oh, shit, he's catching up.

20:29.663 --> 20:31.273
Open your throat
and toss it back.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.449
-Oh, you are being a pussy.
-That can't be a thing.

20:33.493 --> 20:34.798
-Trust me, I was in a sorority.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.235
I put things in my throat
all the time!

20:36.278 --> 20:39.107
-Put the damn thing
to your lips, man.

20:47.028 --> 20:49.291
Allen! Allen!

20:53.513 --> 20:55.384
-Yeah!

20:55.428 --> 20:57.821
-Fuck!
-That was awful.

20:57.865 --> 21:02.609
Ugh. Tastes like Smarties
mixed with Pedialyte.

21:02.652 --> 21:04.915
Tiny bubbles.

21:04.959 --> 21:08.179
One down and one more to go.
-Yeah!

21:09.529 --> 21:12.271
-Oh!
-Oh!

21:12.314 --> 21:13.707
-Whoa.

21:15.448 --> 21:17.319
-This is a brand-new shirt.

21:17.363 --> 21:21.018
-Uh...he didn't finish.

21:21.062 --> 21:22.977
-What?
-She's right.

21:23.020 --> 21:24.370
-Y'all are chugging one on one.

21:24.413 --> 21:26.459
If anybody yaks,
they got to chug a new one.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.290
Down the hatch.
-Please no.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.509
-Nina, go, go.
-Go, go, go!

21:36.295 --> 21:39.907
-Winner!
-Winner! Yes! Yes!

21:39.950 --> 21:44.346
That's what you get.
That's what you get.

21:44.390 --> 21:47.784
You little bitch.
-Okay. Okay.

21:47.828 --> 21:49.351
Give the man some room.

21:49.395 --> 21:52.354
So mean. Come on.

21:52.398 --> 21:55.966
-I love you so much.
You were so great.

21:56.010 --> 21:58.360
-Jaz. Jaz. Hey.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.493
Hey. How are you?
-What's up? What's up?

22:00.536 --> 22:01.929
-Yeah. Could you take care
of that, please?

22:01.972 --> 22:04.279
It smells like
all the bad things. Right?

22:04.323 --> 22:06.368
Together.

22:06.412 --> 22:09.371
-Yeah. Yo, Florida.
-Yes.

22:09.415 --> 22:14.071
-Job security.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

22:14.115 --> 22:16.030
Taking care of, boss.

22:19.947 --> 22:22.123
-Can we not do this?

22:22.166 --> 22:24.865
Milan knows all
the cool, new bars.

22:24.908 --> 22:28.825
You can literally pick
any one you want.

22:28.869 --> 22:31.088
Why fight for this place?

22:31.132 --> 22:34.353
-Okay, so you're a crazy person.
-I'm a realist.

22:34.396 --> 22:37.268
They're basically mini lions
who were never domesticated.

22:37.312 --> 22:39.880
They only allowed people to
give them free food and shelter.

22:39.923 --> 22:43.405
And one day,
I believe they will kill us all.

22:43.449 --> 22:46.495
Happy Valentine's Day.
-Happy Valentine's Day.

22:46.539 --> 22:48.497
Okay.
So you're not a cat person.

22:48.541 --> 22:51.065
-No. Why are you?

22:51.108 --> 22:54.198
-They're low maintenance and
they catch mice and I hate mice.

22:54.242 --> 22:56.418
-Oh, thanks, Jaz.
-Thanks, Jaz.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.072
-Mm-hmm.

22:58.115 --> 23:01.597
-Well, if we ever get a pet,
it's gonna be a dog.

23:01.641 --> 23:03.382
Sorry. Or a pig.

23:03.425 --> 23:05.209
-Hey. If it's good enough
for George Clooney,

23:05.253 --> 23:06.602
it's good enough for me.

23:06.646 --> 23:09.475
-That's what I'm saying.
Wait a minute.

23:09.518 --> 23:11.520
Did we order this?
-Um...

23:11.564 --> 23:13.435
-Hey, Jaz.
-What's up?

23:13.479 --> 23:15.611
-So we didn't order...
-Don't trip.

23:15.655 --> 23:18.788
Elena's got you.
So just sit back and enjoy.

23:24.011 --> 23:27.231
-I think maybe
we're regulars now?

23:27.275 --> 23:30.017
-Hmm.

23:30.060 --> 23:31.801
Sweet.

23:35.109 --> 23:37.416
-I guess I'm just
a glutton for punishment.

23:39.461 --> 23:42.899
-Alright.
Well, it's your funeral.

23:50.777 --> 23:54.171
-Guys, check that one out.

23:54.215 --> 23:56.870
-Just remember to be respectful,
Cameron.

23:56.913 --> 24:00.177
-Oh, of course.
Whatever you say, bro.

24:08.621 --> 24:10.013
-Round two, baby.

24:10.057 --> 24:12.233
-Here we go.
Wah, wah, wah.

24:12.276 --> 24:13.930
Yo, how's Dick holding up,
by the way?

24:13.974 --> 24:15.584
-I mean, he popped open
his Tums,

24:15.628 --> 24:18.326
so won't be long before
he asks for his first drink

24:18.369 --> 24:21.372
and then we can finally
break a chill.

24:21.416 --> 24:22.765
By the way, where's my...

24:22.809 --> 24:24.245
-Oh, I got you.

24:25.942 --> 24:27.683
-I love you, man.

24:27.727 --> 24:30.033
-Mm mm mm mm mm.

24:30.077 --> 24:31.470
-Saw that.

24:33.384 --> 24:35.517
-Uh-oh.

24:35.561 --> 24:37.563
Are you jealous, Tiffany?

24:37.606 --> 24:41.523
-Jealousy is the tribute
mediocrity pays to the genius.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.438
-Damn.
Did you just make that up?

24:43.482 --> 24:45.092
-I saw it on a mug in Venice.

24:45.135 --> 24:46.441
-That's a pretty insightful mug.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.879
-It was in Venice, so it was $50

24:49.923 --> 24:51.359
and it didn't have
any alcohol in it.

24:51.402 --> 24:53.535
So...
-That's criminal.

24:53.579 --> 24:56.886
Well, I don't have any mugs,
but I do make a mean cocktail.

24:56.930 --> 25:00.107
-Well, that's more like it.
-Alright, I shall return.

25:00.150 --> 25:01.848
-Okay.

25:05.808 --> 25:08.028
-Yah.

25:08.071 --> 25:10.291
What does fate
have in store for you?

25:14.469 --> 25:17.516
-Blind man's darts?

25:17.559 --> 25:19.256
What are those?

25:22.912 --> 25:25.741
Alright, y'all, so it's pretty
straight forward.

25:25.785 --> 25:27.090
Three darts each.

25:27.134 --> 25:28.788
Your partner tells you
where to aim.

25:28.831 --> 25:30.354
Highest total wins.

25:30.398 --> 25:32.879
-Uh, Jaz. Pardon me.

25:32.922 --> 25:35.142
Hey, guys.
Very exciting.

25:35.185 --> 25:36.447
Jaz, can I talk to you
for a second?

25:36.491 --> 25:38.624
-Sure.

25:38.667 --> 25:39.973
Hold up, guys.

25:40.016 --> 25:41.931
-It's just gonna be --

25:41.975 --> 25:45.456
I'm just not super comfortable
with the whole blindfolds thing.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.763
You know, it's a bit
of an insurance nightmare.

25:47.807 --> 25:49.330
Right?
So might I suggest --

25:49.373 --> 25:52.072
-Hold. 'Sup, water?
-Hi. Captain.

25:52.115 --> 25:54.161
So I don't know the numbers
of any of the tables.

25:54.204 --> 25:56.859
Could you show me?
-Oh.

25:56.903 --> 26:00.036
-They need drinks, like now.

26:00.080 --> 26:02.430
-Okay.

26:02.473 --> 26:04.475
-My bad. You were saying?

26:04.519 --> 26:07.217
-Well, actually, Jaz, I would
rather her shadow you

26:07.261 --> 26:09.132
and you take over.
-Do you want to train her?

26:09.176 --> 26:11.178
-No, I want you to train her.
-Right.

26:11.221 --> 26:13.093
-Right.
-Great. We're in agreement.

26:13.136 --> 26:15.312
-W-- Ow.

26:15.356 --> 26:17.880
-So it looks like the woman
over at seat 23

26:17.924 --> 26:19.490
is stealing copper cups again.

26:19.534 --> 26:22.015
-Did you say again?
-Did it last week.

26:22.058 --> 26:24.539
Told her this behavior is gonna
lead her down a dark path.

26:24.583 --> 26:25.888
-Oh.

26:25.932 --> 26:27.324
-She doesn't want
to listen to me.

26:27.368 --> 26:28.891
She might listen to you, though.

26:28.935 --> 26:32.591
-Good luck with that.

26:32.634 --> 26:34.636
-Alright.

26:36.551 --> 26:38.379
Let's do this.

26:41.121 --> 26:43.514
-Alright, everybody.

26:43.558 --> 26:46.430
Let's play some fucking darts,
y'all!

26:46.474 --> 26:47.867
Whoo! Yeah!

26:47.910 --> 26:49.825
Ooh.

26:49.869 --> 26:51.435
-There.

26:51.479 --> 26:54.525
Okay, so you're looking
at a large circle,

26:54.569 --> 26:56.092
and there's a circle...

26:56.136 --> 26:57.964
-I know what a dartboard
looks like, Chelsea.

26:58.007 --> 26:59.356
Tell me where to aim.
-Oh, my God.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.663
I'm just trying to paint
a picture for you.

27:01.707 --> 27:03.622
I haven't done this before.
Okay?

27:03.665 --> 27:05.667
-You're right.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

27:05.711 --> 27:08.061
Okay? I'm just stressed.
-I'm stressed, too.

27:08.104 --> 27:12.108
-Okay. Just use visuals
that we both know.

27:12.152 --> 27:15.590
-Okay. Okay. Oh, you know
my dining room table?

27:15.634 --> 27:17.548
-Uh-huh.
-Okay. It's --

27:17.592 --> 27:20.377
The distance between you and the
dartboard is the length of that.

27:20.421 --> 27:22.902
-I can totally see that.
Okay.

27:25.339 --> 27:28.516
-Yeah!
-Damn it.

27:28.559 --> 27:30.649
-So my dining room table --
-No, I get it, Chelsea.

27:32.781 --> 27:36.524
-Hi. I'm the manager.
My name is Dick.

27:39.570 --> 27:41.572
Oh, of course it is.

27:44.314 --> 27:47.274
-Slight breeze blowing

27:47.317 --> 27:49.580
south by southwest.

27:49.624 --> 27:50.973
-We're inside.

27:51.017 --> 27:54.063
-Trust me, it's subtle,
but it's there.

27:55.195 --> 27:56.762
Visualize.

27:56.805 --> 27:59.590
Execute.

27:59.634 --> 28:01.201
Ho ho! 6 points!

28:01.244 --> 28:03.246
-Yeah!
-Way to go, Allen!

28:03.290 --> 28:05.771
No one makes it
on the first try.

28:05.814 --> 28:07.598
-I feel like Luke Skywalker.

28:07.642 --> 28:09.949
-I'll be your Obi-Wan, bitch.
Ah!

28:09.992 --> 28:13.822
-You know, it's actually
about Allen's height.

28:13.866 --> 28:15.694
So picture his face and hit it.

28:21.003 --> 28:22.352
-Oh. Fuck. So close.

28:22.396 --> 28:24.311
-It's okay.
We still have one more.

28:24.354 --> 28:25.921
-Listen, if I could just have
our property back,

28:25.965 --> 28:28.097
I'd really,
really appreciate it.

28:28.141 --> 28:29.708
-I-I don't have your prop--
-I think --

28:29.751 --> 28:31.405
Maybe in...
-No.

28:31.448 --> 28:33.581
-No, just by an accident.
-I need you to watch your tone.

28:38.804 --> 28:40.719
-Right.

28:40.762 --> 28:43.852
-Okay. Put yourself in the same
place as you were before.

28:43.896 --> 28:46.028
Alright?
You got to believe in yourself.

28:46.072 --> 28:47.682
Believe.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.032
-Jesus!
-Shit!

28:50.076 --> 28:52.078
-Definitely a breeze.

28:52.121 --> 28:54.123
-Yeah, definitely, yeah.

28:56.343 --> 28:58.780
-Don't forget.
It's your last dart, Nina.

28:58.824 --> 29:00.608
-What is that supposed to mean?

29:00.651 --> 29:03.611
-Nothing. Just make it count.

29:04.699 --> 29:06.570
-Wait, wait, Nina, wait.

29:06.614 --> 29:08.181
-Oh!
-Oh!

29:11.619 --> 29:12.881
-Yes!

29:12.925 --> 29:16.580
-What's that, a 40 to your 6,
Allen?

29:16.624 --> 29:18.234
You better make it count.

29:21.020 --> 29:22.848
-Just like Colby.

29:22.891 --> 29:25.198
The more you talk shit,
the better she performs.

29:25.241 --> 29:26.895
-R.I.P., Mama.

29:26.939 --> 29:29.942
Also, if you knew that,
why in the shit would you speak?

29:29.985 --> 29:32.074
-I am leaving.
-Oh, no.

29:32.118 --> 29:34.120
No, no, no, no, no.
-You're -- You're touching.

29:34.163 --> 29:36.165
-I-I apologize. I cannot let you
leave. I just...

29:36.209 --> 29:37.993
If you could just hand me
back my mugs, I promise

29:38.037 --> 29:39.429
I will not press charges.

29:39.473 --> 29:40.691
Fair?

29:40.735 --> 29:42.128
-What did you say to me?

29:42.171 --> 29:44.347
-Don't worry, Allen.
It'll be over soon.

29:44.391 --> 29:46.785
Who knows? Maybe they'll name
a cocktail after you.

29:46.828 --> 29:49.700
-Oh, or maybe they'll
make special Allen koozies.

29:49.744 --> 29:51.050
-Oh, yeah, that's good.

29:51.093 --> 29:53.530
You know,
to commemorate your creepy hug.

29:55.054 --> 29:58.709
-Hey, stay focused.
Right?

29:58.753 --> 30:01.364
I want you to see the win
in your future.

30:01.408 --> 30:02.713
Okay?

30:02.757 --> 30:05.542
Be the dart.
I want you to fly.

30:05.586 --> 30:10.547
Okay? Fly like the wind.
Fly like a hummingbird.

30:10.591 --> 30:16.075
You know, searching at
the center of that sweet nectar.

30:16.118 --> 30:18.425
Right?
I want you to be --

30:20.383 --> 30:21.602
-I simply --
-Stay.

30:21.645 --> 30:22.864
-Easy. Everybody, easy.

30:22.908 --> 30:25.475
Please with the monks.
-Hey, stay.

30:25.519 --> 30:27.303
-Easy. I got this.
I got this.

30:27.347 --> 30:28.739
Can you help, please?

30:39.011 --> 30:40.621
Yes!

30:40.664 --> 30:44.973
Here's your mugs!

30:45.017 --> 30:47.106
-No!!!!
-No!!!!

30:47.149 --> 30:51.327
-I...I am certified on Yelp.

30:51.371 --> 30:55.636
-Oh, boy.
-And you and all of you

30:55.679 --> 30:59.118
are going down in flames,
motherfucker.

30:59.161 --> 31:01.990
Yes, because I know... only.

31:02.034 --> 31:04.166
-Everybody, it's all fine.
Don't take...

31:04.210 --> 31:07.256
-Oh, God. Don't -- just stay.
-No.

31:07.300 --> 31:10.390
-I'm gonna take a chair dip.
Give me that thing.

31:10.433 --> 31:13.132
The copper thing.
That better be real, Dick.

31:13.175 --> 31:15.264
-Don't hand it to her, please.
-Just put it on the tray.

31:15.308 --> 31:16.613
-You do not need
the pizza cutter.

31:16.657 --> 31:18.746
-Don't follow me, Dick.
-Okay.

31:18.789 --> 31:21.053
-Oh, crazy. Is it heavy?
-I-I...

31:25.579 --> 31:28.495
-Wonder what her story is.

31:28.538 --> 31:31.063
-Mason, can I have a...

31:33.935 --> 31:35.371
See? This is what
I'm talking about.

31:35.415 --> 31:37.069
You always know
what people need.

31:37.112 --> 31:39.462
This is a great quality
for a manager. People listen.

31:39.506 --> 31:41.987
-You want another one?
Yeah.

31:44.554 --> 31:46.861
-Okay. So where were we?

31:46.905 --> 31:49.255
-Out of wood.
And he hit the bull's-eye

31:49.298 --> 31:50.647
before that crazy lady
blew up the board.

31:50.691 --> 31:53.172
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What bull's-eye?

31:53.215 --> 31:55.391
-What? You saw it.
Both of you did.

31:58.742 --> 32:01.658
-I don't know what I saw.

32:01.702 --> 32:04.487
-Nina, come on.
Don't be like...

32:04.531 --> 32:06.533
-Like what?

32:06.576 --> 32:08.056
-I know you don't like to lose,

32:08.100 --> 32:11.364
but you don't have to stoop
to her level.

32:11.407 --> 32:14.062
-Oh, so now I'm a factor
in this, okay?

32:14.106 --> 32:16.108
-Yeah. What the hell
does that even mean?

32:16.151 --> 32:20.242
-You know exactly what it means.
-I'm what, I'm what, Allen?

32:20.286 --> 32:21.983
I'm outspoken.
I'm opinionated. I'm a lot.

32:22.027 --> 32:25.595
What? What sexist bullshit thing
am I specifically? Tell me.

32:25.639 --> 32:28.120
-It's not sexist.

32:28.163 --> 32:31.688
You're not a nice person, okay?

32:31.732 --> 32:33.560
I'm just being honest.
Sorry.

32:33.603 --> 32:36.215
-No, no, no. you don't get
to talk about

32:36.258 --> 32:38.130
my best friend like that ever.

32:38.173 --> 32:39.653
You hear me?

32:39.696 --> 32:43.222
-I won that game.
-You can't prove it.

32:43.265 --> 32:46.268
-What is this, court?
Forget it. Whatever.

32:46.312 --> 32:50.794
I pick a different challenge.
I'm not doing this one again.

32:50.838 --> 32:52.187
-Fine.

32:58.324 --> 32:59.673
-What are you doing?
We have him right where --

32:59.716 --> 33:02.023
-Stop. He won.
You know he did.

33:02.067 --> 33:05.418
Still, he doesn't get to make
my best friend

33:05.461 --> 33:07.072
feel like an asshole.

33:07.115 --> 33:09.770
-To be fair,
I am kind of an asshole.

33:09.813 --> 33:11.554
-Yeah, but only
I got to say that.

33:11.598 --> 33:15.384
-Hey. Way to stick
to your guns, man.

33:15.428 --> 33:17.038
I didn't want to bring this up,

33:17.082 --> 33:19.258
but Uniformity L.A.
reached out again.

33:19.301 --> 33:22.522
-What are those ass clowns
applauding?

33:22.565 --> 33:24.132
-Hmm.
-Oh, my God.

33:24.176 --> 33:26.569
Message Alexander.
Get him here.

33:26.613 --> 33:28.441
-No.
-Oh, my God.

33:28.484 --> 33:30.008
You don't have to fuck him.

33:30.051 --> 33:32.401
At least not yet.
It's for leverage.

33:32.445 --> 33:35.056
Imagine the look on Allen's face

33:35.100 --> 33:38.233
when he sees you
with that demigod.

33:38.277 --> 33:41.628
He will fold
like a lawn chair.

33:41.671 --> 33:42.977
All's fair, hmm?

33:44.892 --> 33:47.416
-And they're talking about
giving us marketing dollars

33:47.460 --> 33:49.723
for the next two years.

33:49.766 --> 33:51.551
That's huge. I mean,

33:51.594 --> 33:55.468
we got to sit down with them
before they change their minds.

33:55.511 --> 33:59.776
-Uh, Milan, I just have bigger
fish to fry right now.

33:59.820 --> 34:03.084
So if we can talk about that
after the holiday...

34:03.128 --> 34:06.087
-Okay. Yeah. Okay.
But first thing after --

34:09.003 --> 34:10.961
You okay?

34:11.005 --> 34:14.356
-Whoa. That was fast.
Thirsty much, Alexander?

34:18.056 --> 34:20.449
-Christ, I'm sweating.

34:25.150 --> 34:27.369
-Oh, my God.
I cannot wait to see

34:27.413 --> 34:30.242
the look on Allen's
face when he walks in.

34:32.548 --> 34:34.811
-Nina, hey.

34:34.855 --> 34:36.639
-What now?

34:36.683 --> 34:38.206
-I was way out of line
back there.

34:38.250 --> 34:39.686
I'm sorry.

34:39.729 --> 34:43.690
I don't know what came over me.

34:43.733 --> 34:45.605
-Thanks.

34:45.648 --> 34:48.216
Still gonna kick
your ass, though.

34:48.260 --> 34:49.304
-Let's get to it.

34:49.348 --> 34:50.392
-Alright.

34:54.918 --> 34:57.356
Human bowling.

34:57.399 --> 34:59.271
-Human? As opposed to what?

35:01.969 --> 35:06.669
Alright.
Who's ready for the showdown?!

35:21.075 --> 35:24.165
-Human bowling.
Nice choice.

35:24.209 --> 35:26.036
-I didn't write the damn thing.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.865
-I have a hunch who did.

35:30.606 --> 35:35.394
-So, Elena I just happened
to have one of these in her van?

35:35.437 --> 35:36.438
Okay.

35:37.831 --> 35:39.528
-Hey, this is fun.

35:39.572 --> 35:41.835
I feel like I'm loading you
into, like, a space shuttle.

35:41.878 --> 35:44.229
Like, well,
Like a catapult or something?

35:44.272 --> 35:46.405
-Well, I'm glad
you're having fun.

35:46.448 --> 35:47.754
-Yes.

35:50.452 --> 35:51.975
-Who knows?

35:52.019 --> 35:54.717
After this, Allen might be
out of the running.

35:54.761 --> 35:56.328
-Oh, Chelsea,

35:56.371 --> 35:58.068
-I am not hoping he'll die.

35:58.112 --> 35:59.940
Just that he'll go to the E.R.,
something like that.

35:59.983 --> 36:01.202
-Oh, my God.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.770
-Just the E.R.
-Alright.

36:03.813 --> 36:07.208
Come on, Milan,
send it or me.

36:07.252 --> 36:10.124
-Three, two, one.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.256
Engage!

36:12.561 --> 36:13.823
Oh, God! Oh, God!

36:16.086 --> 36:17.697
Oh, yes!

36:17.740 --> 36:20.003
-Four pins, baby!

36:20.047 --> 36:21.440
You crushed it, man.

36:21.483 --> 36:23.485
Hey, man, you was like
a red fireball, man.

36:23.529 --> 36:25.705
Hey, I was scared, man.
I almost shit myself.

36:25.748 --> 36:27.315
-Great fucking roll.

36:27.359 --> 36:28.969
-Oh, my God.
That dude is so right.

36:29.012 --> 36:30.492
This is amazing.
I can't thank you enough.

36:30.536 --> 36:33.147
This is the best
Christmas present ever.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.236
No, no, no.
That's not going to be --

36:35.280 --> 36:37.107
that's not going to be --
it's not going to that bad --

36:37.151 --> 36:39.327
bad for you like that,
no.

36:39.371 --> 36:42.374
Milan, get back here and help me
get out of this thing.

36:42.417 --> 36:44.027
-This thing freaks me out.

36:44.071 --> 36:46.813
-Um, I'm the one that's strapped
into this nightmare.

36:46.856 --> 36:49.598
Okay? Just aim straight.

36:49.642 --> 36:50.904
It can't be that hard.
-Okay, okay.

36:50.947 --> 36:53.602
Uh, alright. It's my time.

36:53.646 --> 36:55.256
Uh, I'm not going to count,
I guess.

36:55.300 --> 36:56.997
I'm just gonna --
I'm gonna go for it.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.433
-Okay.
-Sorry, I haven't --

36:58.477 --> 37:00.043
-I'm -- I'm -- I'm really
triggered right now.

37:00.087 --> 37:01.828
You know, I had this uncle
who went on this homemade

37:01.871 --> 37:03.743
roller coaster in Germany,
and it messed up

37:03.786 --> 37:06.136
his inner ear fluid permanently,
and it gave him vertigo.

37:06.180 --> 37:08.313
And now he's in a wheelchair.
-This is not the time, Chelsea.

37:08.356 --> 37:11.054
-Okay, okay.
I'm sorry. Okay.

37:11.098 --> 37:12.578
Okay, okay.

37:12.621 --> 37:13.666
Okay!

37:17.931 --> 37:20.934
-4-3, our winner!

37:23.545 --> 37:25.286
-You having fun, man.

37:25.330 --> 37:27.810
-I mean,
nothing matters.

37:27.854 --> 37:30.117
-You know, some things matter.

37:30.160 --> 37:32.685
Like my new year shift.

37:35.165 --> 37:38.908
-Hi. Hi.
Oh, I'm so sorry. Hi.

37:38.952 --> 37:41.650
-Well, that sucks.
That sucks so bad.

37:41.694 --> 37:44.653
-Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

37:44.697 --> 37:46.351
-Oh.

37:46.394 --> 37:47.917
Oh, it's Dex.

37:47.961 --> 37:49.745
Do you mind if I...?
-Yeah, it's fine.

37:49.789 --> 37:51.312
Tell him I said hi.

37:55.011 --> 37:56.230
-Hey, loser.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.972
-I hate you.
I hate it so much.

37:59.015 --> 38:00.103
-Let me help you out of that.

38:00.147 --> 38:02.149
-Okay.

38:03.585 --> 38:05.108
-Hey, hon.
How's the girl's night?

38:05.152 --> 38:07.589
-Oh, we're on the way
to our second gang bang,

38:07.633 --> 38:09.287
so we're running kind of behind.

38:09.330 --> 38:12.464
-That's nice. Hey, don't draw
on daddy's suit, please.

38:12.507 --> 38:13.943
Thank you.

38:13.987 --> 38:15.554
So, the girls want to watch
a documentary

38:15.597 --> 38:16.903
on the floating trash island.

38:16.946 --> 38:19.035
Do you know where we keep
the Apple remote?

38:19.079 --> 38:21.124
'Cause...

38:21.168 --> 38:23.213
-Thanks.

38:23.257 --> 38:24.911
Did you spit in this?

38:24.954 --> 38:27.174
-Well, yeah.

38:30.482 --> 38:32.135
Looks like they're
enjoying the show.

38:32.179 --> 38:33.615
-Totally.

38:33.659 --> 38:35.487
-No way.
There's a remote on my phone.

38:35.530 --> 38:37.097
Are you sure about that?

38:37.140 --> 38:39.142
-Yes, for fuck sake.
Okay, just go away.

38:39.186 --> 38:40.535
Let me say goodnight
to the demons.

38:40.579 --> 38:42.363
-Hey, girls,
come say goodnight to Mommy.

38:42.407 --> 38:44.626
-Hi, Mommy.
-Where's Auntie Nina?

38:44.670 --> 38:46.933
-We miss you.
-Are you coming home?

38:46.976 --> 38:49.239
Are you?
-Hi, my nightmares.

38:49.283 --> 38:51.416
I barely remember you,
and Nina's dead,

38:51.459 --> 38:53.069
and hopefully not.

38:53.113 --> 38:54.854
-Oh, my God, Chelsea.
You were right.

38:54.897 --> 38:56.725
Girls, I got the TV to work

38:56.769 --> 38:58.814
-It's almost damn time, Dad.

38:58.858 --> 39:00.599
-Yeah, Dad.
-Love you, Mommy.

39:00.642 --> 39:03.384
-Yeah, you better make us
breakfast, Mom.

39:03.428 --> 39:04.472
-Bye.
-Bye.

39:08.955 --> 39:10.391
Hey, word to the wise.

39:10.435 --> 39:12.175
Condoms don't do shit.

39:12.219 --> 39:14.264
Want to be safe?
Just stick to anal.

39:20.575 --> 39:22.795
-I'm experimenting here,
but don't hold back.

39:22.838 --> 39:24.623
I want your honest opinion.

39:24.666 --> 39:26.059
-I'm going to give you
my honest opinion.

39:26.102 --> 39:27.234
-Alright.

39:30.585 --> 39:32.021
My Lord.
-Yes.

39:32.065 --> 39:33.501
-You're like a mad scientist.

39:33.545 --> 39:37.984
-I aim to please.
-I can see that.

39:38.027 --> 39:40.813
Well, when you open
your own spot,

39:40.856 --> 39:42.162
this one goes on the menu.

39:42.205 --> 39:45.208
-My own spot? Uh...
-Yeah.

39:45.252 --> 39:47.210
You're cute, but crazy.

39:47.254 --> 39:49.343
-Is that crazy?

39:49.387 --> 39:52.825
What? You're good at it,
so why not?

39:52.868 --> 39:56.263
I mean, you could finally be
free to do your own thing.

39:56.306 --> 39:58.396
-Oh, this is freedom.

39:58.439 --> 40:00.876
Actually running a bar?

40:00.920 --> 40:03.879
My days would be consumed
with admin bullshit,

40:03.923 --> 40:06.578
and I'd miss out on all the fun.

40:06.621 --> 40:08.710
Like tonight,
not to mention

40:08.754 --> 40:12.714
all the interesting people
like you.

40:12.758 --> 40:16.544
-Well, I guess some of us have
to keep the party going, right?

40:16.588 --> 40:18.764
-Precisely.

40:18.807 --> 40:20.635
Excuse me.
-Okay.

40:24.639 --> 40:26.162
-Looks like you're having fun.

40:26.206 --> 40:28.208
-Bro, she's rad, man.

40:28.251 --> 40:29.905
Gone a couple of dates now.
-Okay.

40:29.949 --> 40:33.387
I met a lot of girls,
but I think I found a match.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.345
-She is fine
with the capital F.

40:35.389 --> 40:37.217
-Oh, my God.
-Give me some. Good job.

40:37.260 --> 40:38.392
-Yes, indeed.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.394
-Yeah.
What do you want?

40:40.438 --> 40:41.656
-Give me a couple of beers.
-Oh, okay.

40:41.700 --> 40:43.876
-Oh, hold on.

40:43.919 --> 40:45.878
And a charge.

40:45.921 --> 40:48.358
-Yeah.
-People here are so nice.

40:48.402 --> 40:50.099
-Just remember, hip pocket.
-Hip pocket.

40:50.143 --> 40:51.797
-Yeah.
-Okay, I'm not going to forget.

40:51.840 --> 40:54.016
Alright, I'll be right
back with your drinks.

40:57.150 --> 40:58.630
-Hey, Autumn?
-Yeah.

40:58.673 --> 41:00.762
-You know that guy?

41:00.806 --> 41:03.852
-That is a talent agent,
and he says he wants

41:03.896 --> 41:06.681
to hip pocket me.

41:06.725 --> 41:10.032
Hip pocket.
How cool is that, Sam?

41:12.600 --> 41:14.254
-This is why I keep the suit on.

41:14.297 --> 41:16.256
Actresses are everywhere.

41:16.299 --> 41:17.649
I guarantee she hooks
us up with a round

41:17.692 --> 41:19.172
every time we're here.

41:19.215 --> 41:20.913
At least till she gets fired.

41:22.305 --> 41:23.481
-This place is fast.

41:23.524 --> 41:25.221
-It's going to get even better.

41:25.265 --> 41:29.356
Was talking to Dick about
bringing in some live music.

41:29.399 --> 41:30.792
-What now?

41:30.836 --> 41:33.534
-So, I've been working
with some musicians,

41:33.578 --> 41:36.015
and they're looking for a spot
to test out their new songs.

41:36.058 --> 41:38.713
And this place would be perfect.

41:38.757 --> 41:42.935
Think of how awesome it would
be here with live music.

41:42.978 --> 41:44.632
-A lot of places
have live music.

41:44.676 --> 41:47.896
This place has its own thing.

41:47.940 --> 41:50.377
You don't want
to mess with that.

41:50.420 --> 41:52.205
-I'm not trying to mess with it.

41:52.248 --> 41:55.208
I'm trying to help it evolve.

41:55.251 --> 41:59.255
Everything has to evolve, Allen,
or it dies.

41:59.299 --> 42:02.868
-Not if you take care of it.

42:02.911 --> 42:05.740
-What is that supposed to mean?

42:05.784 --> 42:09.396
-Oh, look, it's Allen's
vestigial pal.

42:09.439 --> 42:11.354
Hey, jokes on you?

42:11.398 --> 42:14.575
I don't even know
what vestigial means?

42:14.619 --> 42:16.534
-Damn it,
that's actually effective.

42:16.577 --> 42:19.406
-What's up, homie?
You okay?

42:19.449 --> 42:21.060
-Yeah, yeah.

42:21.103 --> 42:23.932
Um, let's just, uh,
pick the next challenge

42:23.976 --> 42:25.717
and get this over with.

42:25.760 --> 42:27.501
-Yeah, agreed.

42:31.679 --> 42:33.638
-Round three?
Sick.

42:33.681 --> 42:35.770
Alright, let me drop this,
and I'll grab the hat.

42:41.733 --> 42:43.386
-Excuse me.

42:43.430 --> 42:46.781
Any of you know where
the bathroom in this place is?

42:46.825 --> 42:49.044
-Allow me.

42:57.662 --> 43:00.099
It's a challenge where we see
who can get

43:00.142 --> 43:02.014
the most phone numbers
in one hour.

43:02.057 --> 43:04.930
Oh, you are so fucked.

43:04.973 --> 43:06.627
-Alright, save it, save it.

43:06.671 --> 43:08.934
So, it's five minutes
till midnight.

43:08.977 --> 43:10.457
Why don't we start
the clock, then?

43:10.500 --> 43:11.937
-Oh, perfect,
because I want to get a drink

43:11.980 --> 43:13.895
before the grand finale.

43:13.939 --> 43:15.593
You know what, Nina?
We should leave them alone

43:15.636 --> 43:17.072
to brood over the inevitable.

43:17.116 --> 43:19.640
-Mm-hmm.

43:19.684 --> 43:22.643
-You know, I do feel sorry
for you, Allen.

43:22.687 --> 43:24.732
But I love how savage she is.

43:24.776 --> 43:26.560
It's fucking hot.

43:26.604 --> 43:27.779
-Thanks, Jaz.

43:27.822 --> 43:31.086
-Oh, no.
Again, thank you, Allen.

43:31.130 --> 43:34.133
See you in five.

43:35.917 --> 43:38.572
-Hey, when's your Uber Meats
arriving?

43:38.616 --> 43:41.357
-I didn't order any food.
-No, Alexander, Uber Meats

43:41.401 --> 43:46.058
-Oh, oh, oh. He said 11:30,
so any minute now.

43:46.101 --> 43:47.929
-This is going
to be glorious!

43:49.278 --> 43:51.150
-Look, there's no reason
to freak out.

43:51.193 --> 43:53.413
-Dude, I haven't even
thought about talking

43:53.456 --> 43:55.894
to a woman in five years.

43:55.937 --> 43:57.591
-Look, it's all
about confidence.

43:57.635 --> 43:59.724
Just act like you
were talking to William.

43:59.767 --> 44:01.464
-That was an interview.
It's not the same.

44:01.508 --> 44:03.336
-Yes, the fuck it is.

44:03.379 --> 44:05.599
Now, look. Drink up, man.
Chug that shit.

44:05.643 --> 44:06.948
Man up.

44:06.992 --> 44:08.646
-So, listen.

44:08.689 --> 44:11.605
Now, I saw you over there
talking to my friend, Autumn.

44:11.649 --> 44:13.694
Now, she's new to the city,
so I just want to make sure

44:13.738 --> 44:15.522
you're being honest with her.

44:15.565 --> 44:18.612
-Are you her dad?
Just show me the bathroom.

44:18.656 --> 44:20.919
-I advise you to listen to me.

44:20.962 --> 44:24.531
-Or what?
What are you going to do?

44:24.574 --> 44:26.185
-Nothing.

44:26.228 --> 44:28.970
But I can't say
the same thing about her.

44:29.014 --> 44:30.668
-Shit.

44:30.711 --> 44:32.147
-See, I'm a pacifist.

44:32.191 --> 44:34.236
But my friend Elena here,
she's, um...

44:36.499 --> 44:39.067
-What the fuck?

44:39.111 --> 44:40.503
-It's fair to say
that she's not.

44:42.636 --> 44:45.508
-Pardon me, miss.
-Oh.

44:45.552 --> 44:47.206
-Hi. I lied to you.
I'm an assistant.

44:47.249 --> 44:48.642
I can't do anything
for your career personally.

44:48.686 --> 44:50.035
Mostly I just get coffee.

44:50.078 --> 44:51.427
I'm not allowed
to answer the phone.

44:51.471 --> 44:52.733
In here is my email.
If you message me,

44:52.777 --> 44:54.604
I'll set up a meeting
with my boss.

44:54.648 --> 44:56.345
She can actually help you. No
guarantees, but I'll do my best.

44:56.389 --> 44:58.391
Also in here is a check
with a 30 percent tip.

44:58.434 --> 45:00.306
Thank you
for your excellent service.

45:00.349 --> 45:01.611
Good day.

45:07.269 --> 45:08.923
-I love L.A.

45:10.664 --> 45:13.449
-Alright, keeping this
on the DL for obvious reasons,

45:13.493 --> 45:14.624
but this is it, y'all.

45:14.668 --> 45:16.409
Midnight, the witching hour.

45:16.452 --> 45:18.759
You both have until 1:00 A.M.,
last call,

45:18.803 --> 45:21.631
Whoever gets the most numbers
claims victory.

45:21.675 --> 45:23.503
Wingmen are highly encouraged.

45:23.546 --> 45:25.331
Now, the loser doesn't
have to go home,

45:25.374 --> 45:27.420
but they can't stay here.

45:27.463 --> 45:30.597
Got it? Alright, go make
mama proud, bitches.

45:39.824 --> 45:43.044
-Hey, do you mind
if we join you?

45:43.088 --> 45:45.655
-It's a free country.

45:45.699 --> 45:47.570
-Allen, don't pay attention
to them.

45:47.614 --> 45:50.269
Alright?
Good your head in the game.

45:50.312 --> 45:51.618
Come on.

45:53.402 --> 45:54.708
-Yeah?

45:54.752 --> 45:56.536
-Black leather jacket,
that's her.

45:57.929 --> 46:00.670
-Um, hi. Hello.

46:00.714 --> 46:03.456
-Hi.

46:03.499 --> 46:04.762
-Hey, how --
how you ladies doing?

46:04.805 --> 46:07.373
My name's Milan.
This is my buddy, Allan.

46:07.416 --> 46:09.679
Would you guys mind
if we have a seat?

46:15.860 --> 46:18.036
-So, what are you drinking?

46:18.079 --> 46:21.866
Wouldn't you like to know?

46:21.909 --> 46:24.346
-She would.
That's why she asked.

46:24.390 --> 46:26.522
-I'm just messing with you.
-Oh.

46:26.566 --> 46:27.915
-Or am I?

46:27.959 --> 46:31.005
-Oh.

46:31.049 --> 46:34.139
-What's happened?
-I have no idea.

46:34.182 --> 46:36.750
-Sorry. I just, uh...

46:36.794 --> 46:38.665
Um, you're very pretty,
and I'm sure you get this

46:38.708 --> 46:40.449
all the time,
but I just want you to know

46:40.493 --> 46:44.149
I'm not, like,
a serial killer or anything.

46:44.192 --> 46:45.759
-Real high bar
you're setting there.

46:45.803 --> 46:48.544
-It just seems like
it would be exhausting,

46:48.588 --> 46:52.722
and my job is already --
takes a lot of effort.

46:52.766 --> 46:54.202
-Slight improvement.

46:54.246 --> 46:57.553
Still not great.
What do you do for work?

46:57.597 --> 46:59.381
-Oh, he's --
he's a carpenter, yeah.

46:59.425 --> 47:01.427
We have a business together,
so...

47:01.470 --> 47:03.603
-I've never met
a carpenter before.

47:03.646 --> 47:07.694
-We're not all like Jesus,
but I do enjoy fish.

47:09.739 --> 47:11.350
Yeah, that didn't feel right.

47:11.393 --> 47:14.875
-So, is -- is this part
of your competition?

47:17.356 --> 47:19.097
We have eyes.

47:19.140 --> 47:21.534
You and your ex are in some
battle royale for the bar.

47:21.577 --> 47:23.536
Is this part of it?

47:23.579 --> 47:25.538
-Uh...

47:25.581 --> 47:28.889
Yes, it is, it is.

47:28.933 --> 47:30.412
We're supposed to get
as many phone numbers

47:30.456 --> 47:32.110
as we can in one hour.

47:33.894 --> 47:35.809
-So, are you single or...?

47:35.853 --> 47:38.116
-It's a complicated question.

47:38.159 --> 47:40.422
-But it's really not, like,
at all.

47:40.466 --> 47:43.817
-Oh, I get it.

47:43.861 --> 47:47.038
Yeah.
You're funny.

47:47.081 --> 47:49.257
You should, um, get my number.

47:49.301 --> 47:52.521
-Slow down.
Buy me a drink first.

47:52.565 --> 47:53.827
-Okay, yeah.
No, I can't pretend anymore.

47:53.871 --> 47:55.263
-Oh, thank Christ.
-This is --

47:55.307 --> 47:56.656
-It feels like we're stuck
in some sort of

47:56.699 --> 47:58.223
douche who's on first time loop.

47:58.266 --> 47:59.572
-Yes, thank you.

47:59.615 --> 48:00.878
-Wha-- Wait.

48:02.575 --> 48:03.706
You're leaving?

48:03.750 --> 48:06.622
-Oh, I don't know.
Are we?

48:06.666 --> 48:08.450
-Are we leaving?
-Or maybe we're staying.

48:08.494 --> 48:10.061
Maybe we're staying and going
at the same time.

48:10.104 --> 48:11.976
-Yeah, we're just messing
with you.

48:12.019 --> 48:14.108
-We're messing with you.
-It's very complicated.

48:14.152 --> 48:16.110
It's really complicated,
but we're going to go

48:16.154 --> 48:17.807
or we're going to stay,
but we're going to go.

48:17.851 --> 48:19.940
-Uh, are we going to stay?
-Like, Oh, my God.

48:19.984 --> 48:21.724
We're going to go.
-You're terrible.

48:21.768 --> 48:22.943
-Yeah.
-Bye, guys.

48:25.337 --> 48:26.773
-Look, I'm sorry.
I'll just --

48:26.816 --> 48:28.601
I'll get out of here.
-Hey.

48:28.644 --> 48:31.038
You want my number or not?

48:31.082 --> 48:33.562
-Uh, yeah. I mean, yes.
-Yes.

48:33.606 --> 48:35.086
-For sure.
-Give me your phone.

48:35.129 --> 48:36.348
-Okay.

48:39.917 --> 48:42.615
-I like coming to this bar,
so here's the deal.

48:42.658 --> 48:46.532
If you win, try this again.

48:46.575 --> 48:48.969
Maybe work on some game.

48:49.013 --> 48:50.971
-That's a big maybe, but --

48:51.015 --> 48:54.844
-My advice, chill the fuck out.

48:54.888 --> 48:58.326
-Will do, Amanda.

48:58.370 --> 49:01.199
Chill the fuck out.

49:01.242 --> 49:02.896
Dude.
-Dude.

49:02.940 --> 49:04.898
What do I do now?
-Do the same shit again.

49:04.942 --> 49:05.943
Do it again, do it again.

49:05.986 --> 49:07.553
-Yeah.

49:07.596 --> 49:09.337
-Well, there's a twist.

49:12.297 --> 49:13.733
-Damn it.
-Okay, where's Alexander?

49:13.776 --> 49:15.082
-He's supposed to be here.
I don't know.

49:15.126 --> 49:17.650
-Fuck, fuck.

49:17.693 --> 49:19.913
Oh, hey, that bro
clearly wants attention.

49:19.957 --> 49:21.349
-Alright.
-Let's move. Just don't think.

49:21.393 --> 49:23.177
Do whatever it takes
to get his number.

49:23.221 --> 49:24.962
Grab his dick if you have to.
-I'm not gonna grab his dick.

49:25.005 --> 49:27.007
-You want me to grab his dick?
-Nobody is grabbing dicks.

49:27.051 --> 49:29.618
You got a thing with dicks,
girl.

49:29.662 --> 49:32.839
-Hi.
-Hello.

49:32.882 --> 49:34.841
-And that right there,
that's only some of his work.

49:34.884 --> 49:36.799
You should swing
by the shop sometime.

49:36.843 --> 49:38.236
-I can build you something.

49:42.762 --> 49:44.459
-Not bad, Allen.

49:44.503 --> 49:46.244
-So, I work in
entertainment law.

49:46.287 --> 49:47.680
-I'll take a mojito, no sugar.

49:47.723 --> 49:48.986
Make sure the glass
is clean this time.

49:49.029 --> 49:50.726
What do you want?

49:50.770 --> 49:52.511
-I have an Old Fashioned.
-She'll have an Old Fashioned.

49:52.554 --> 49:54.426

-And separate tabs.

50:16.056 --> 50:17.623
Right?

50:17.666 --> 50:20.887
I-I was hoping that
it would be okay if she maybe,

50:20.930 --> 50:23.542
you know, took your --
your New Year's Eve shift.

50:23.585 --> 50:25.718
Now, I mean, she's, you know --
you know how she can get

50:25.761 --> 50:28.851

-I'll do it.

50:28.895 --> 50:31.028
It'll be nice to have
New Year's off for once.

51:35.396 --> 51:37.268
-Yeah, baby Hey, man,
I'm so proud of you, man.

51:37.311 --> 51:39.270
Hey, you did it.
I'm about to go take a piss.

51:39.313 --> 51:40.836
And when I come back,
we gonna take a selfie.

51:40.880 --> 51:43.578
BRB.
Hey, Mason, where my phone at?

51:43.622 --> 51:48.453
-Well, that was one
epic battle, Nina.

51:48.496 --> 51:50.107
I commend you on...

51:53.893 --> 51:57.375
-So, that's it?
No more, Nina?

51:57.418 --> 52:00.813
-I guess.
That was the deal?

52:00.856 --> 52:04.904
-Yeah.
She put up a good fight, though.

52:04.947 --> 52:08.386
-Alright, dudes.
Last call.

52:08.429 --> 52:09.865
Let's get these fuckers out
of here because it's that time,

52:09.909 --> 52:11.476
and daddy needs a cigarette

52:11.519 --> 52:12.955
without getting dirty looks.
You know what I mean?

52:12.999 --> 52:14.522
-Hey, could you do me
a favor first?

52:14.566 --> 52:16.176
-Mm, what's that?

52:16.220 --> 52:18.613
-Never call yourself daddy
in my presence ever again.

52:18.657 --> 52:20.093
-Yeah.

52:33.889 --> 52:37.023
-Hey, slut.
How are you feeling?

52:40.505 --> 52:42.507
I'm feeling -- feeling great.

52:42.550 --> 52:46.685
So good.
Why do you ask?

52:46.728 --> 52:48.817
I'm sorry that I roped you
into this.

52:48.861 --> 52:51.994
I know tonight was not
what we had planned.

52:52.038 --> 52:53.344
-Oh, fuck off.

52:53.387 --> 52:54.562
This was the most
excitement I've had

52:54.606 --> 52:56.216
since the girls were born.

52:56.260 --> 52:58.827
And that was a crazy time.
Three nurses quit.

52:58.871 --> 53:01.526
-Yeah.
-I'm sorry.

53:01.569 --> 53:04.659
-Thanks.
You know, it's funny.

53:04.703 --> 53:09.447
Until an hour ago, I wasn't
worried about being single.

53:09.490 --> 53:12.014
I know I'm awesome.

53:12.058 --> 53:16.541
But if tonight was a preview
of single life in my thirties,

53:16.584 --> 53:19.805
I mean, every guy out there
was a fucking joke.

53:22.024 --> 53:25.027
And not to mention that this
will be the first holiday

53:25.071 --> 53:28.727
without Allen in five years.

53:31.033 --> 53:35.951
I don't know. All of a sudden,
the future looks so bleak.

53:35.995 --> 53:40.129
-Well, that was melodramatic,

53:40.173 --> 53:42.480
and some slippery
slope bullshit.

53:42.523 --> 53:45.309
Look, you had one bad night
at a fucking bar.

53:45.352 --> 53:47.746
Yeah, L.A.'s full of
pretentious dipshits,

53:47.789 --> 53:49.835
but you're here.

53:49.878 --> 53:51.750
So if you're here,
there must be other guys

53:51.793 --> 53:54.274
who feel the same way you do.

53:54.318 --> 53:57.146
And they're going to love
the shit out of you,

53:57.190 --> 53:59.758
because you fucking deserve it.

53:59.801 --> 54:01.020
-I love you.

54:01.063 --> 54:02.891
I love you, too.

54:04.719 --> 54:06.547
I hate to be the bearer
of more bad news,

54:06.591 --> 54:09.855
but I got to bounce.

54:09.898 --> 54:12.205
-Crisis at home?
-No, Dexter locked himself

54:12.249 --> 54:14.816
out of the house again
taking out the trash,

54:14.860 --> 54:16.949
and he's at the neighbors
waiting for me.

54:16.992 --> 54:18.385
-He can't wake up the girls.

54:18.429 --> 54:19.865
-No, he doesn't want to.

54:19.908 --> 54:22.607
He'd rather just wait
for me to come home.

54:22.650 --> 54:24.478
-That's oddly sweet.

54:24.522 --> 54:26.350
-I know.

54:26.393 --> 54:29.222
Ugh, I love him so much
sometimes it's gross.

54:30.832 --> 54:32.530
-Are you sure you're going
to be okay if I leave?

54:32.573 --> 54:35.794
-Yes.
Yeah.

54:35.837 --> 54:37.709
-Okay.

54:37.752 --> 54:39.624
I love you.
-I love you.

54:40.929 --> 54:42.583
-And fuck this bar.
It's stupid.

54:42.627 --> 54:44.759
-Yeah, fuck it.
-Yeah.

54:44.803 --> 54:46.065
-Go.

54:55.901 --> 54:58.991
-Alright, what do I owe ya?
-Oh, it's on me, no.

54:59.034 --> 55:02.647
It's the least I could do
for being such a lovely company.

55:02.690 --> 55:04.083
-You really don't
have to do that.

55:04.126 --> 55:07.869
-Well, I know one way
you can repay me.

55:07.913 --> 55:11.090
Looks like I'm not working
New Year's Eve.

55:11.133 --> 55:14.354
So, how about you and I ring
in the New Year together?

55:14.398 --> 55:17.357
-Oh, Mas, I'm --
I'm r-really sorry,

55:17.401 --> 55:19.228
but I don't think so.

55:19.272 --> 55:21.753
I mean, you're really charming,

55:21.796 --> 55:23.363
and I've had
a lot of fun with you.

55:23.407 --> 55:26.061
But if I'm being honest,

55:26.105 --> 55:28.586
I need someone
who's a little more --

55:28.629 --> 55:33.373
God, I hate I'm saying this --
but serious.

55:33.417 --> 55:35.375
More serious.

55:35.419 --> 55:39.205
-Oh. Oh, oh.

55:39.248 --> 55:41.512
I -- I-I can --

55:41.555 --> 55:44.689
No, I can --
I can be serious.

55:44.732 --> 55:49.041
I can be serious.
Um...

55:49.084 --> 55:50.825
Hmm,
I at least want to try.

55:50.869 --> 55:55.874
-I know, but I can't be
someone's trial.

55:55.917 --> 55:58.267
I need someone who knows.
You know?

56:00.922 --> 56:03.229
-Yeah, I get it.
I get it.

56:03.272 --> 56:05.753
-Thanks for understanding.

56:05.797 --> 56:07.712
I really am sorry.

56:14.501 --> 56:18.331
-Look, man, I just got an email
from Uniformity.

56:18.375 --> 56:20.072
"Finally connected with Allen.

56:20.115 --> 56:24.293
Sorry we couldn't work it out.
Best of luck to you both."

56:24.337 --> 56:26.644
-Milan, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you.

56:26.687 --> 56:28.733
-When did this happen?

56:28.776 --> 56:32.301
Between which challenge
where I was helping you

56:32.345 --> 56:36.044
did you send this email?

56:36.088 --> 56:40.179
-Hang on.
Let's just talk about this, man.

56:40.222 --> 56:45.489
-This -- this is beyond
shitty, man.

56:45.532 --> 56:47.926
They reached out to me, Allen.

56:47.969 --> 56:50.276
-Let's not forget
this is my company.

56:50.319 --> 56:51.582
-Right, right, yeah.

56:51.625 --> 56:53.845
I'm just the upbeat sidekick,
right?

56:53.888 --> 56:55.542
You don't want
to take me seriously?

56:55.586 --> 56:58.066
Definitely, you don't want
to treat me like an actual

56:58.110 --> 57:00.199
fucking business partner.

57:00.242 --> 57:01.505
-It's not like that, man.

57:01.548 --> 57:03.811
It's just lately
you've been kind of...

57:03.855 --> 57:06.466
-What? I'm what, Allen?

57:06.510 --> 57:08.381
-Well, it's like you've been
treating the business like

57:08.425 --> 57:12.124
it's some kind of Instagram,
Pinterest, click baity thing.

57:12.167 --> 57:14.822
And it's not -- it's not an app.

57:14.866 --> 57:16.345
We sell furniture.

57:16.389 --> 57:18.435
-Right, right.

57:18.478 --> 57:20.828
Well, you know what?

57:20.872 --> 57:22.613
I'm out, man.

57:22.656 --> 57:25.267
But hey, congrats, though.

57:25.311 --> 57:27.400
You got what you wanted.

57:27.444 --> 57:29.054
It's all you now, man.

57:30.969 --> 57:33.580
Best of luck.

57:33.624 --> 57:35.060
-Milan.

57:35.103 --> 57:36.975
Milan!

57:37.018 --> 57:38.933
Are you serious?!

57:43.242 --> 57:44.548
Hey.

57:44.591 --> 57:46.071
-Hey.

57:46.114 --> 57:48.465
Are you...

57:48.508 --> 57:50.510
Sorry.

57:50.554 --> 57:54.079
It's not my business anymore,

57:54.122 --> 57:57.778
and this isn't
my bar anymore, so...

58:03.392 --> 58:05.394
You guys are the best.

58:10.051 --> 58:12.358
-I'm still pissed
about the darts.

58:14.186 --> 58:16.536
-Okay.

58:16.580 --> 58:18.756
-You said you beat me.

58:18.799 --> 58:22.455
And if that's true,
then technically we're tied,

58:22.499 --> 58:26.807
and I can't live
with that doubt.

58:26.851 --> 58:28.635
-What are you saying?

58:28.679 --> 58:31.420
-Autumn, can I get
a ruling on this?

58:31.464 --> 58:35.120
Shouldn't the winner
have to win by two?

58:35.163 --> 58:37.035
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yes.
Win by two.

58:37.078 --> 58:38.645
Mm-hmm, yes.

58:38.689 --> 58:41.561
-Because that will make me
feel a lot better.

58:41.605 --> 58:44.259
Um, maybe just like
a simple game

58:44.303 --> 58:46.000
like rock, paper, scissors?

58:46.044 --> 58:47.349
Does that work?

58:47.393 --> 58:48.612
-Oh, totally.

58:48.655 --> 58:50.352
That's how we do it in Tampa.

58:50.396 --> 58:53.704
You know, so if -- if Adam wins
this challenge, then,

58:53.747 --> 58:55.401
well, you know, game over.

58:55.444 --> 58:58.186
But if Nina wins, whoo,
we got to go into overtime.

58:58.230 --> 59:01.363
-Unless, you know,
you don't want to

59:01.407 --> 59:04.541
and you want to admit
that I did beat you in darts

59:04.584 --> 59:08.283
and that you were wrong
and lied.

59:08.327 --> 59:10.808
Because then I'd be fine.

59:14.159 --> 59:16.204
-How many throws?

59:16.248 --> 59:17.945
-One, on three.

59:22.341 --> 59:24.691
-Ooh! Boom, overtime, baby!

59:24.735 --> 59:25.997
-What's -- what's happening?
-Hey.

kind of hard to explain.

1:03:29.240 --> 1:03:32.591
So I got stuck helping a friend
in an emergency.

1:03:32.634 --> 1:03:34.288
That's why I wasn't able
to meet earlier.

1:03:34.332 --> 1:03:36.508
I tried messaging you after,
but you weren't answering.

1:03:36.551 --> 1:03:38.771
And I saw that on the app,
you hadn't left

1:03:38.815 --> 1:03:41.252
this location
and it was super late,

1:03:41.295 --> 1:03:46.257
so I came to make sure
you're okay.

1:03:46.300 --> 1:03:47.998
-The app?
-Yeah.

1:03:48.041 --> 1:03:51.871
Uh, this stupid dating app
has a location function.

1:03:51.915 --> 1:03:54.178
Any normal person would think
that you left

1:03:54.221 --> 1:03:57.746
your cellphone at the bar,
but I have three sisters.

1:03:57.790 --> 1:03:59.574
And I know.

1:03:59.618 --> 1:04:03.796
I can hear how crazy the sounds
now coming out of my mouth.

1:04:03.840 --> 1:04:05.798
-No, it's okay.

1:04:05.842 --> 1:04:10.324
It's sweet, actually,
but as you can see, I'm fine.

1:04:10.368 --> 1:04:12.936
-And then some.

1:04:12.979 --> 1:04:16.635
Right, I'll leave you
to whatever you're doing.

1:04:16.678 --> 1:04:19.943
I saw nothing.
No, it's okay.

1:04:19.986 --> 1:04:23.816
You know, actually, if I didn't
creep you out too much,

1:04:23.860 --> 1:04:26.645
I'd still love
to buy you a drink.

1:04:26.688 --> 1:04:29.474

of course.

1:04:29.517 --> 1:04:31.911
-No.
Yeah.

1:04:31.955 --> 1:04:33.391
I'll message you.

1:04:33.434 --> 1:04:34.914
-Awesome.
Okay.

1:04:34.958 --> 1:04:37.786
Well, have a nice night.
It's nice meeting you all.

1:04:37.830 --> 1:04:40.137
Kind of.
I'm going to go.

1:04:40.180 --> 1:04:41.486
-Bye.
Bye, bye.

1:04:44.054 --> 1:04:45.533
-That was clearly interference.

1:04:45.577 --> 1:04:48.101
-Get a mulligan.

1:04:48.145 --> 1:04:49.886

-Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

1:04:52.279 --> 1:04:54.978
-It's fine. Looks like the flat
end just landed on him.

1:04:55.021 --> 1:04:56.936
-Alright, alright, let's,
um, give him a hand.

1:04:56.980 --> 1:04:58.329
Come on.
-Aah.

1:04:58.372 --> 1:04:59.591
-It's gonna be alright.

1:04:59.634 --> 1:05:01.941
-Easy, easy.

1:05:01.985 --> 1:05:05.466
-Okay, okay.
Just gonna get this off.

1:05:09.209 --> 1:05:10.384

you were being so stubborn.

1:05:57.431 --> 1:05:58.737

in fucking stone, Allen.

we talked about it.

-Sure, we talked about it.
Yippee.

1:10:58.863 --> 1:11:02.301

invited us to do something fun.

-I'm not closed off
to suggestion.

1:11:08.438 --> 1:11:11.049
I try new things.
-Just not for me.

1:11:11.092 --> 1:11:13.051
-Well, there is
a breaking point.

1:11:13.094 --> 1:11:17.360
Not everything needs updating
or a Nina-once-over.

-A Nina-once-over?

1:11:20.319 --> 1:11:22.365

a better way with you.

1:11:28.936 --> 1:11:31.069
That's rich.

If there's any deviation
from what you planned,

1:11:34.594 --> 1:11:36.814
it's like the world ended.

1:11:36.857 --> 1:11:38.685
I just watched you torch
a friendship

1:11:38.729 --> 1:11:40.383
and business partnership tonight

1:11:40.426 --> 1:11:42.515
because you wouldn't
let go of control.

1:11:42.559 --> 1:11:44.604
That's why we broke up, Allen.

1:11:44.648 --> 1:11:46.389
Because you refused to grow.

1:11:46.432 --> 1:11:47.868
-Hold on.
That's not fair.

1:11:47.912 --> 1:11:51.350
I created a business
from nothing,

1:11:51.394 --> 1:11:54.745
and I cultivated it
and took care of it.

1:11:54.788 --> 1:11:57.487
There comes a time
when you have to accept

1:11:57.530 --> 1:11:59.924
the thing for what it is.

1:11:59.967 --> 1:12:03.928
Can't tweak it forever,
or else...

1:12:03.971 --> 1:12:06.626
it won't be the thing you built.

1:12:06.670 --> 1:12:08.367
-That's such a twisted way --

1:12:08.411 --> 1:12:13.067
-You're trying to say that I
haven't evolved or whatever,

1:12:13.111 --> 1:12:18.377
but really I've just
accepted myself for who I am.

1:12:18.421 --> 1:12:22.468
And you don't like it,
so you broke up with me

1:12:22.512 --> 1:12:25.950
because I'm not good enough
for you anymore.

1:12:27.778 --> 1:12:30.128
-That's not true.

1:12:30.171 --> 1:12:36.177
I grew up, and I wanted to try
and see new things with you.

1:12:36.221 --> 1:12:38.615
But what I wanted
didn't matter anymore.

1:12:44.664 --> 1:12:48.886
-Why didn't you bring up
the bar when we broke up?

1:12:50.844 --> 1:12:52.803
-I don't know.

1:12:55.153 --> 1:12:59.026
I guess I knew
it would upset you.

1:12:59.070 --> 1:13:00.854
Why didn't you bring it up?

1:13:00.898 --> 1:13:07.948
-Maybe just reminded me of when
things were good between us.

1:13:07.992 --> 1:13:12.823
Look, I -- I want to be
with someone

1:13:12.866 --> 1:13:16.261
who accepts me for who I am.

1:13:16.304 --> 1:13:20.570
-And I need someone
who's willing to grow with me.

1:13:20.613 --> 1:13:22.398
-Where does that leave us?

1:13:25.183 --> 1:13:27.315
-Do I have to be
the one to say it?

1:13:27.359 --> 1:13:28.839
-Say what?

1:13:31.407 --> 1:13:34.888
-That we just don't care enough
about each other to compromise.

1:13:37.151 --> 1:13:39.458
-Police. Nobody move.

1:13:39.502 --> 1:13:40.807
-Oh, fuck!

1:13:42.418 --> 1:13:45.464
-The city has pretty clear rules
on after hours consumption,

1:13:45.508 --> 1:13:48.554
Mr. Tishwany.

1:13:48.598 --> 1:13:51.296
Okay, we're going to need
everyone to step --

1:13:51.339 --> 1:13:52.863
-Raymond?

-Sure, yeah. Sure.

1:14:18.845 --> 1:14:22.545
-10-4, over.
We have a bar fight.

1:14:22.588 --> 1:14:24.416
-It's under control.
Let's go.

1:14:30.640 --> 1:14:33.556

1:14:33.599 --> 1:14:36.428
-So, Mason?

1:14:36.472 --> 1:14:39.562
-You want to tell us
what just went down?

1:14:39.605 --> 1:14:41.520
-No.

1:14:41.564 --> 1:14:47.221
-So, Elena, may I ask
how do you know him?

1:14:47.265 --> 1:14:49.136
-AA.

1:14:49.180 --> 1:14:52.009
Well, thank goodness for you.

1:14:53.445 --> 1:14:57.928
-What is so fucking funny?

1:14:57.971 --> 1:15:00.234
You realize we nearly
got shut down, yeah?

1:15:06.023 --> 1:15:08.939
I get that it's no fun working

1:15:08.982 --> 1:15:10.854
when other people
are having fun,

1:15:10.897 --> 1:15:13.509
but work isn't to supposed
to be fun.

1:15:13.552 --> 1:15:16.033
It's supposed to be work.
It's not supposed to be fun.

1:15:16.076 --> 1:15:19.253
Honestly, I should fire you all.

1:15:21.255 --> 1:15:25.042
I should --
I should fire myself.

1:15:25.085 --> 1:15:28.219
I should fire myself.
No more fucking around.

1:15:28.262 --> 1:15:30.177
You got it?

1:15:30.221 --> 1:15:34.051
Autumn, if you want,
you can start full time tonight.

1:15:34.094 --> 1:15:37.141
-Oh. Thank you.

1:15:37.184 --> 1:15:38.882
-Welcome to the fam, Autumn.

1:15:38.925 --> 1:15:41.449
-Actually, don't.
Call me Florida.

1:15:41.493 --> 1:15:43.626
I like representing.

1:15:43.669 --> 1:15:46.193
-Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, yes, yes, yes.

1:15:47.673 --> 1:15:51.329
I know we didn't figure out
who gets to stay,

1:15:51.372 --> 1:15:53.897
so I'll make it easy.

1:15:53.940 --> 1:15:55.986
You're both 86ed.

1:15:56.029 --> 1:15:57.901
Okay?

1:15:57.944 --> 1:16:00.599
But also you're adults.

1:16:00.643 --> 1:16:05.256
Why are you making us
decide for you?

1:16:05.299 --> 1:16:07.998
Grow up.

1:16:08.041 --> 1:16:12.002
Whatever.
I'm still hammered.

1:16:12.045 --> 1:16:13.656
What are you guys
doing hanging around?

1:16:13.699 --> 1:16:15.005
Clean this place up.

1:16:17.181 --> 1:16:19.096
Good luck you two.

1:16:29.410 --> 1:16:31.064
-Well, I'm --
-I guess we should --

1:16:31.108 --> 1:16:33.545
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

1:16:33.589 --> 1:16:36.330
-I'm that way.
-Yeah, I'm...

1:16:36.374 --> 1:16:38.419
Want me to walk you?

1:16:38.463 --> 1:16:39.856
-Sexist.

1:16:43.990 --> 1:16:47.211
-What I said in there,
I didn't mean --

1:16:47.254 --> 1:16:48.429
-You did.

1:16:50.170 --> 1:16:53.434
So did I.

1:16:53.478 --> 1:16:56.481
I just wish it didn't
come out that way.

1:16:56.524 --> 1:17:00.050
I was...

1:17:00.093 --> 1:17:02.574
Anyway, I'm --

1:17:02.618 --> 1:17:04.924
I'm sorry about that.

1:17:04.968 --> 1:17:07.927
Me, too.

1:17:07.971 --> 1:17:10.930
But also I'm not sorry.

1:17:14.804 --> 1:17:16.153
-Me, too.

1:17:20.331 --> 1:17:22.333
Goodbye, Allen.
