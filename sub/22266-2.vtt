I promise.

for Samantha's death.

on the news last night?

on the photo released last night?

01:07.401 --> 01:10.018

the accusation of being the Green Arrow?

Ladies and gentlemen, please.

01:13.282 --> 01:14.443
If you wanna know what I have to say

01:14.533 --> 01:16.320
it would probably help
if you could hear me.

01:17.744 --> 01:18.860
Thank you.

01:18.954 --> 01:20.286
I'm gonna tell you two things,

01:20.372 --> 01:21.988
both of which
you probably already know.

01:22.457 --> 01:26.451
First, this is important,
I am not the Green Arrow.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.502
If you're not the Green Arrow,
then who is?

01:28.589 --> 01:29.796
Number two,

01:29.881 --> 01:31.588
photos can be doctored.

01:31.675 --> 01:34.793
They could've put Bruce Wayne's head
on that body.

01:34.886 --> 01:37.970
Has Bruce Wayne left Gotham
to hangout in Star City recently?

01:38.056 --> 01:39.092
No.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.424
Now, if I was running around the city

01:41.518 --> 01:43.805
during the day
and managing it as mayor,

01:43.895 --> 01:47.309
while running around at night
fighting criminals as a vigilante,

01:47.399 --> 01:49.436
that really would make me
a superhero.

01:51.737 --> 01:54.320
But I'm not, I'm just the mayor.

01:55.532 --> 01:56.864
Thank you very much.

You seem to be taking this
in your stride.

02:01.330 --> 02:03.037
I've been here before with you.

02:03.874 --> 02:07.367
Yeah, but I didn't have a photograph
of you in <i>flagrante de Arrow.</i>

02:07.502 --> 02:09.788
- Where did Channel 52 get the photo?
- Anonymous source.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.122
Arrived in yesterday's mail.
No return address.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.047
Get the envelope,
let's get it to forensics

02:14.134 --> 02:15.841
and let's figure out who leaked it.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.048
And why.

02:18.847 --> 02:22.932
We can't let this distract us.
Where are we with rebuilding SCPD?

02:23.018 --> 02:24.975
Well, I fast-tracked
the insurance claim.

02:25.062 --> 02:26.678
So, we should have 20 million
burning a hole

02:26.772 --> 02:28.183
in our account by the end of the day.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.434
Our account?

02:29.524 --> 02:31.607
I figure we peel off
a few bucks and fly off to Vegas.

02:31.693 --> 02:32.729
(LAUGHS) That's cute.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.272
I think it might be
a little suspicious

02:34.363 --> 02:35.820
if Oliver left town right about now.

02:35.906 --> 02:38.148
I need to be in town
for the Markovian delegation.

02:40.327 --> 02:43.570

you have an appointment.

Uh, can we help you with something?

Not really. I'm here as a courtesy,

03:02.766 --> 03:05.383
to inform you of the investigation
I'll be conducting in your city.

03:05.477 --> 03:06.763

03:07.562 --> 03:08.552
You.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.180
(SCOFFS) You gotta be kidding.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.765

03:18.490 --> 03:21.324
Can you honestly say you're surprised
there's an investigation?

03:21.410 --> 03:23.823
No, but I wasn't expecting the FBI.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.780
Well, quite frankly,
the local law enforcement

03:26.873 --> 03:29.411
has proven ineffective
where the Green Arrow is concerned.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.292
Agent Watson?

03:32.087 --> 03:35.626
- Yes.
- I was cleared five years ago.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.504

not the Green Arrow.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.419
And you were cleared by the guy
who's now your deputy mayor.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.593
Would like me to send you a copy of
the polygraph that Mr. Queen passed?

03:44.683 --> 03:45.764
For starters.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.851
The local AG will be issuing
subpoenas later on today.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.975
It was nice meeting you, gentlemen.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.433
I'm sure we'll be seeing
a lot more of each other.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.161
At least they caught his good side.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.906
Sorry, not funny.

All right, John said
you guys have experience

04:11.501 --> 04:13.117
putting this particular genie
back in the bottle.

04:13.211 --> 04:14.998
Well, yeah, I mean,
John's put on the hood on before,

04:15.088 --> 04:16.168
but I don't see how
that's gonna work now,

04:16.255 --> 04:17.588
not with photographic evidence.

04:17.673 --> 04:18.709
What about the human target?

04:18.800 --> 04:19.916
The human what-now?

04:20.594 --> 04:21.834
Best cosplayer ever.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.669
He can literally make himself
look like someone else.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.256
Yeah, Chance is out of the country
right now, only God knows where.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.261
We have to think of a new way
of getting out of this.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.554
And if we can't?

04:29.895 --> 04:31.887
Because assuming Oliver
does not go to prison,

04:31.980 --> 04:34.222
he's not gonna be able to do anything
with a million eyes on him.

04:34.316 --> 04:36.228
Not to mention that if he's outed...

04:37.027 --> 04:38.563
Rather if he stays outed,

04:38.987 --> 04:40.569
it won't be much of a leap
to the rest of us.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.110
- One step at a time.
- FELICITY: Okay.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.658
First step being, figuring out
where this picture came from.

04:47.829 --> 04:48.990
It came from nowhere.

04:49.581 --> 04:50.571
What do you mean?

04:50.665 --> 04:53.373
I mean, this envelope wasn't
mailed, delivered or sent.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.702
It came from inside
the Channel 52 news offices.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.870
- How do we know that?
- Barcode.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.673
Channel 52 uses it
for internal traffic.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.215
How many people work there?

05:02.552 --> 05:04.919
- Five-hundred and sixty-eight.

say it to say it,

05:06.556 --> 05:07.546
what if this was Chase?

05:07.641 --> 05:09.974
He could've put this in motion
months ago, a little parting gift.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.972
Seems like his style
messing with you like this.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.145

with all this?

05:17.484 --> 05:20.898
Okay. I wanted to keep him home from
school, but he insisted on going.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.479
- Like his father, huh?
- I wasn't much of a student.

05:23.573 --> 05:24.905

CURTIS: Where's he standing?

05:32.958 --> 05:35.496
If we can figure out when and where
this was taken,

05:35.585 --> 05:36.792
it could give us something to go on.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.244
I wrote an image analysis algorithm,

05:38.338 --> 05:40.125
but there's just not very much
for the computer to chew on.

05:40.215 --> 05:41.877
Was the original photo
taken digitally,

05:41.967 --> 05:43.003
or was it taken
the old-fashioned way?

05:43.093 --> 05:44.800
Digital. Printed on standard
inkjet stock.

05:44.886 --> 05:46.673
- Hmm.
- Okay, maybe if we can get the file,

05:46.763 --> 05:49.426
there may be metadata on it and
we can figure out who took the photo.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.632
That's a pretty epic maybe.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.263
Yeah, well, like you said,
if we don't figure this out and fast,

05:53.353 --> 05:54.639
we're screwed.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.721
- I did say that, didn't I?
- Yeah, you did.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.977
This could destroy our whole lives.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.184
It's hard to think that before,
my biggest worry was

06:01.653 --> 06:03.189
getting a new job, and now...

06:04.072 --> 06:05.813
It's about whether or not
we'll end up in jail.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.899
I thought you were sitting pretty
from your Palmer Tech severance.

06:07.993 --> 06:09.484
Yeah, from like a year ago.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.453
What are you gonna do?
Assuming that we're all not in jail.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.246
I mean, I'd definitely rather go to
Iron Heights

06:14.332 --> 06:15.948
than work at Tech Village again.
That place was horrendous.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.667
What about you? I mean, you've been
out of a job as long as I have.

06:18.795 --> 06:21.754
Not really. I've been doing some
freelance coding in my spare time.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.547
(STAMMERING) What? What spare time?

06:23.633 --> 06:24.794
Yeah, tell me about it.

06:25.176 --> 06:28.044
Barely any but I did not take a dime
from Paul in the divorce

06:28.263 --> 06:29.253
and a man's gotta eat.

06:29.347 --> 06:31.464
So you just got a secret job this whole
time you didn't tell anyone about?

06:31.558 --> 06:33.299
I thought we all, like,
had, like, secret jobs.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.804
- No.
- Except for John maybe.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.262

that's been perplexing me.

06:52.537 --> 06:53.527

- We're not gonna talk about that.
- Except to say it's a load of crap.

By offering subsidized leasing to
Markovia's Vortex Industries,

06:59.836 --> 07:02.624

a high-tech factory here,

09:47.670 --> 09:48.911
Dinah, I'm fine.

09:49.339 --> 09:50.625
The only thing that's
really bothering me,

09:50.715 --> 09:52.081
is you being up in my business.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.587
(DOOR OPENS)

09:54.677 --> 09:56.339
Hey, we came as soon as we heard.

09:57.388 --> 09:59.971
We need to know why
Anatoly took the Markovians

10:00.058 --> 10:01.299
and we need to find him now.

10:01.392 --> 10:03.600
Oliver, Felicity and Curtis are on
this but you need to stay here.

10:03.686 --> 10:05.552
Look, I know I said before
Chase could be behind this

10:05.647 --> 10:08.230
- but now I'm thinking...
- It's Anatoly.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.023
He leaked the photo to tie my hands.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.934
We're on this. We'll take care of it.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.403
- SQL or Java?
- What?

10:18.493 --> 10:22.077
In your job, as a secret programmer.
Are you coding in SQL or Java?

10:22.664 --> 10:24.656
Both. Plus, a little SWIFT.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.410
I can't believe you've had
a secret job this whole time

10:26.501 --> 10:27.582
and you didn't even tell me about it.

10:27.669 --> 10:30.332
Is this relevant to locating
the Bratva and/or their hostages?

10:30.421 --> 10:32.003
I am multitasking.
Thank you very much.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.171
And yes, if you must know,

10:33.258 --> 10:35.966
I am running my image analysis
algorithm on the photo of Oliver.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.674

crapping out again.

10:41.850 --> 10:42.966
Don't despair.

10:43.059 --> 10:46.052
I think I might have a line
on our friend Anatoly.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.812
Now, working on the assumption

10:48.898 --> 10:50.981
that he hasn't been
in town that long,

10:51.067 --> 10:52.433
I wondered how he was fixed for cash.

10:52.527 --> 10:53.984
I bet his Bratva buddies
are good for it, no?

10:54.112 --> 10:55.603
Well, he has to pay them somehow.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.359
Cash would set off
too many alarm bells,

10:57.448 --> 10:58.984
plus he'd have to
convert it from rubles.

10:59.117 --> 11:02.360
Credit cards are way too
easy to track. But then there's...

11:04.122 --> 11:06.159
Crypto-currency is virtually
impossible to track.

11:06.624 --> 11:07.956
For mere mortals.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.877

- We haven't determined the motive

11:21.097 --> 11:22.759

- ...to recover the hostages back.

around the clock.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.178
- All right?
- Thank you, Minister.

11:26.269 --> 11:28.010
Yes, that's right.
We'll be in touch. Thank you.

handled, but...

11:37.030 --> 11:38.146
It felt like you were lying?

11:38.823 --> 11:40.280
Where are we with the SCPD?

your city recently

21:46.180 --> 21:48.388

might be able to diagnose the poison.

Yeah, they should have something

33:42.562 --> 33:43.769
He's off-limits.

33:44.481 --> 33:46.268
You're aware that
telling an FBI agent

33:46.358 --> 33:48.771
how to conduct their investigation
is obstruction of justice.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.102
If I really am the man that
you think I am,

33:51.446 --> 33:53.403
how far do you think
such a man would go

33:53.490 --> 33:55.652
to keep his son
from being scrutinized

33:55.742 --> 33:57.028
by the FBI?

33:58.870 --> 33:59.906
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

34:03.291 --> 34:05.749
- Ms. Watson?
- A little busy here.

34:06.628 --> 34:08.870
There's something on the news
that you need to see.

34:10.340 --> 34:13.299
<i>Channel 52 just received
exclusive evidence</i>

34:13.385 --> 34:16.878
<i>which conclusively establishes
that the photograph of Mayor Queen</i>

34:16.972 --> 34:20.056
<i>as the Green Arrow
was digitally doctored.</i>

34:20.141 --> 34:23.009
<i>This is the second time that
Mayor Queen has faced allegations</i>

34:23.103 --> 34:26.062
<i>of being a vigilante and twice
he has been exonerated.</i>

34:26.147 --> 34:28.230
- Lucky you.
- Not really.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.308
Like I said...

34:30.652 --> 34:32.063
I'm not the man you think I am.

34:32.152 --> 34:33.940
No, Mr. Queen, I think you are.

34:34.864 --> 34:37.607
And if you think this means
I'm dropping my investigation,

34:37.701 --> 34:39.408
then you're the one who's mistaken.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.820
You should do whatever
it is you have to.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.370
(NEWSREADER CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)

34:45.667 --> 34:49.411
<i>The evidence received by Channel 52
showing that Mr. Queen's face</i>

34:49.504 --> 34:51.541
<i>had been placed
on the Green Arrow's body</i>

34:51.630 --> 34:54.795
<i>was received earlier today
from an unknown source...</i>

34:54.884 --> 34:56.000
Nailed it.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.505
You know, I don't wanna
sound arrogant,

34:57.596 --> 34:59.883
but we may very well be the smartest
human beings on the planet.

34:59.973 --> 35:02.181
Oh, well, it's not arrogant
if it is accurate.

35:02.267 --> 35:03.633
(CHUCKLES) Yeah. True that.

35:04.311 --> 35:06.598
And you still find the time
to look bummed out. Crazy.

35:07.355 --> 35:10.314
I mean, our photo analysis
algorithm was right, right?

35:10.400 --> 35:12.813
The photo of Oliver was doctored.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.977
- So...
- So? What's the problem?

35:15.071 --> 35:17.654
So, who would want to frame
Oliver for being the Green Arrow?

35:18.074 --> 35:19.190
Wow.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.780
Way to kill the mood.

35:22.245 --> 35:23.452
- Sorry.
- No, listen.

35:23.538 --> 35:24.904
That is future us' problem.

35:24.998 --> 35:27.741
I'm not gonna, like, let you take
away my buzz right now, okay.

35:27.834 --> 35:30.451
Present us is only worried about

35:30.545 --> 35:32.081
you quitting your
nobody-told-about job.

35:32.172 --> 35:33.413
When are you gonna let that go?

35:33.506 --> 35:34.622
When you go into business with me.

35:34.716 --> 35:36.548
I'm sorry, go into what with you?
Wait, what?

35:36.635 --> 35:38.592
Work with me on this.
We work so well together.

35:38.762 --> 35:40.298
Okay, that
photographic analysis algorithm

35:40.388 --> 35:41.845
is just one of many in a long list

35:41.931 --> 35:44.139
of amazing tech that
you and I have collaborated on.

35:45.101 --> 35:46.182
Think about all the good we could do.

35:46.269 --> 35:48.386
All the cool stuff we could do.
All the cool things we could make.

35:50.065 --> 35:51.055
Please don't say no.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.271
- Yes.
- Oh, thank God, good.

35:55.362 --> 35:57.319
Because I already
filed the paperwork.

35:59.199 --> 36:00.360
Oh, man, this is so cool.

36:00.784 --> 36:03.948
We'll be like Woz and Jobs,
like, back in '76.

36:04.037 --> 36:05.198
Wait. Who's Woz and who's Jobs?

36:06.790 --> 36:07.906
- Shotgun Jobs!
- Shotgun Jobs!

36:14.130 --> 36:15.120
Hey.

36:16.216 --> 36:17.252
Can we talk for a second?

36:20.428 --> 36:22.044
There's nothing to talk about.

36:24.391 --> 36:26.474
We both know that's not true, Dinah.

36:27.852 --> 36:28.842
(SIGHS)

36:30.313 --> 36:31.679
What do we both know?

36:35.652 --> 36:37.109
I need you to say it.

36:39.322 --> 36:42.235
You nearly got killed last night
because you couldn't rely on me.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.446
- Because you're compromised.
- I know.

36:46.871 --> 36:47.861
I know.

36:52.669 --> 36:54.626
Things just got worse
than I was willing to admit.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.213
That's okay.

37:03.847 --> 37:05.338
But what are you gonna do about it?

37:06.975 --> 37:08.136
Tell Oliver.

37:10.729 --> 37:11.936
Go from there.

37:18.027 --> 37:19.393
(INDISTINCT GRUNTING ON TV)

37:19.487 --> 37:22.104
- You're home early.
- So I am.

37:23.616 --> 37:25.653
I'm hoping to make that
more of a regular thing.

37:25.744 --> 37:26.780
If that's okay with you.

37:27.746 --> 37:28.907
Whatever.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.116
I would like to apologize.

37:35.420 --> 37:36.410
For what?

37:36.504 --> 37:40.248
For making you a promise
I wasn't 100% sure I could keep.

37:49.392 --> 37:51.429
You were right, and I was wrong.

37:56.900 --> 37:59.859
Raisa said you have a hard time
admitting when you're wrong.

38:00.904 --> 38:02.111
You have no idea.

38:05.950 --> 38:10.615
Buddy, I heard what you said
in the limo and I hear you.

38:12.707 --> 38:14.118
But I also meant what I said.

38:14.209 --> 38:19.329
I am going to do
everything in my power, forever,

38:21.508 --> 38:24.467
to make sure that you never
end up alone in this world.

38:26.179 --> 38:28.171
And I know that you think that
that's not up to me.

38:30.016 --> 38:33.384
And that's a fair, smart, point.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.429
Which is why I think...

38:37.232 --> 38:40.145
I found a way
so that maybe it can be.

38:40.944 --> 38:42.856
- How?
- I'm working on the details.

38:44.072 --> 38:48.112
I want you to believe me when I say
that I'm trying to make it happen.

38:49.369 --> 38:50.359
All right?

38:52.997 --> 38:54.033
One more thing.

38:55.500 --> 38:56.707
I promise

38:58.169 --> 39:00.411
that I will do my best
every single day

39:02.799 --> 39:05.416
to be the very best father
that I can be.

39:07.720 --> 39:10.053
And that I know how to be.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.141
That promise is 100%.

39:20.316 --> 39:21.352
Okay.

39:26.531 --> 39:27.738
Wanna play with me?

39:34.122 --> 39:37.035
- What is this?
- Honestly, I don't know.

39:37.125 --> 39:40.209
All you got to do is just button mash
and see where we can win.

39:40.628 --> 39:41.618
All right, let me try.

39:41.713 --> 39:42.829
- Yeah.
- All right.

39:53.308 --> 39:54.640
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

39:56.978 --> 39:58.094
Thanks for meeting me.

39:58.187 --> 40:00.474
Yeah, well, I wanted to talk to you
about a few things.

40:04.110 --> 40:05.100
What is it, Oliver?

40:06.446 --> 40:08.233
I'd like you to do something for me.

40:09.032 --> 40:10.614
If it's suit up as Green Arrow,

40:10.700 --> 40:12.441
Felicity and I already talked
about it and we don't think

40:12.535 --> 40:13.776
it's enough to take
the heat off of you.

40:13.870 --> 40:14.986
That's not what I'm asking.

40:18.166 --> 40:19.156
You're serious?

40:20.084 --> 40:22.497
Every time, that I'm out there
as the Green Arrow,

40:22.587 --> 40:23.873
I'm a target.

40:24.422 --> 40:27.540
Of the FBI, of the Bratva...

40:29.177 --> 40:30.713
Of the threats that are out there

40:30.803 --> 40:33.466
and the threats that are
undoubtedly coming.

40:36.351 --> 40:37.387
And on my own,

40:39.145 --> 40:40.261
I can take it.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.478
I'm not on my own anymore.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.147
I cannot be responsible

40:52.075 --> 40:56.695
for my son losing
the only parent that he has left.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.998
- Oliver...
- Star City needs the Green Arrow.

41:04.045 --> 41:05.661
It just can't be me anymore.

41:09.133 --> 41:10.624
So, I'd like it to be you.
