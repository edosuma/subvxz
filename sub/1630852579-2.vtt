00:01.909 --> 00:03.836
NARRATOR: Throughout the world,
enormous stone monoliths

00:03.920 --> 00:07.089
have stood
for thousands of years.

00:07.248 --> 00:10.250
Many were built
to align with the stars.

00:10.334 --> 00:13.086
The monolith
has religious implications.

00:13.179 --> 00:14.513
It's pointing to the heavens.

00:14.597 --> 00:18.008
NARRATOR: Some are
said to have strange powers.

00:18.101 --> 00:20.019
People get electric shocks.

00:20.103 --> 00:22.604
They have altered states,
experiences.

00:22.764 --> 00:25.274
NARRATOR: And there are
clues that they may have had

00:25.433 --> 00:27.109
a technological function.

00:27.193 --> 00:30.937
These stones are standing
in just the right locations

00:31.022 --> 00:33.523
where you could create
a release of energy.

00:33.616 --> 00:36.359
NARRATOR:
Are the ancient standing stones

00:36.444 --> 00:40.280
simply the earliest monuments
of prehistoric humans?

00:40.373 --> 00:44.043
Or might they have
a far more profound purpose?

00:44.127 --> 00:47.629
The standing
stones are a calling card.

00:47.789 --> 00:51.875
They are a message that
somebody was here in the past,

00:51.959 --> 00:54.470
and they were our teachers.

00:56.964 --> 00:59.132
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

00:59.225 --> 01:02.061
in the universe.

01:02.145 --> 01:04.897
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:06.649 --> 01:08.650
It demands
we question everything

01:08.810 --> 01:10.977
we have ever been taught.

01:11.071 --> 01:15.324
The evidence is all around us.

01:15.408 --> 01:18.735
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:18.820 --> 01:21.488
We are not alone.

01:21.572 --> 01:24.875
We have never been alone.

01:42.093 --> 01:45.938
NARRATOR: Biologists, from the
Utah Division of Wildlife Resources,

01:46.022 --> 01:48.098
surveying a nearby canyon,

01:48.191 --> 01:50.851
spot a strange,
rectangular-shaped object

01:50.944 --> 01:52.519
from their helicopter.

01:52.603 --> 01:55.614
DAVID CHILDRESS:
They saw this metallic slab

01:55.698 --> 01:57.440
down in the canyon.

01:57.525 --> 02:00.953
It was a vertical slab
about 10 to 12 feet tall.

02:01.112 --> 02:03.455
And they were astonished
because this...

02:03.614 --> 02:08.377
this remote canyon is almost
only accessible by a helicopter.

02:10.046 --> 02:11.880
NARRATOR:
Satellite imaging reveals

02:12.039 --> 02:15.801
that the triangular column,
dubbed the "Utah monolith,"

02:15.960 --> 02:19.471
has stood undetected
for over four years,

02:19.556 --> 02:23.475
and its discovery quickly
becomes international news.

02:25.136 --> 02:26.970
There was terrific speculation

02:27.063 --> 02:29.973
when the Utah monolith
was first discovered...

02:31.151 --> 02:33.643
as to the provenance
of the monolith, you know,

02:33.736 --> 02:36.655
was this
communication from E.T.s?

02:37.899 --> 02:40.901
And I think people were
really excited by this idea,

02:40.985 --> 02:43.328
because it's drawing on

02:43.413 --> 02:47.166
the monolith
in<i> 2001: A Space Odyssey,</i>

02:47.250 --> 02:48.834
which was a science-fiction book

02:48.993 --> 02:51.912
written in 1968
by Arthur C. Clarke.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.005
And in the same year,

02:53.164 --> 02:56.175
Stanley Kubrick
directed the movie.

02:56.259 --> 02:59.595
And together, they captured
the imagination of the world.

03:00.755 --> 03:06.092
<i>2001</i> begins with this
monolith appearing on Earth.

03:07.270 --> 03:10.189
And through that monolith,
as we all know from the movie,

03:10.273 --> 03:13.108
this is
how our evolution begins.

03:14.268 --> 03:16.686
The appearance
of a similar monolith

03:16.771 --> 03:19.031
in a remote location in Utah

03:19.115 --> 03:21.775
gives us the sense
of a connection

03:21.868 --> 03:24.453
with alien intelligence,

03:24.612 --> 03:28.040
the idea of a point of contact.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.294
NARRATOR: While it is
still not known for certain

03:32.378 --> 03:35.047
just who
erected the Utah monolith,

03:35.206 --> 03:36.957
it is believed
to have been nothing more

03:37.050 --> 03:38.875
than an art installation

03:38.960 --> 03:41.544
and was removed
shortly after its discovery

03:41.629 --> 03:43.964
by a group of conservationists.

03:44.048 --> 03:46.391
During the following weeks,

03:46.476 --> 03:48.477
similar monoliths
started popping up

03:48.636 --> 03:50.562
on nearly every continent.

03:51.973 --> 03:54.140
TIM BRENNAN:
So between December and January,

03:54.234 --> 03:57.903
you had hundreds of monoliths
appearing around the world.

03:57.987 --> 04:00.822
And there were nine monoliths in
the U.K. alone within a month.

04:02.149 --> 04:04.150
NARRATOR:
But why did the Utah monolith

04:04.235 --> 04:06.245
spark this
worldwide fascination?

04:08.072 --> 04:10.749
Was it all because of
a science-fiction movie?

04:11.918 --> 04:12.993
Or is it possible,

04:13.077 --> 04:15.671
as ancient astronaut theorists
believe,

04:15.755 --> 04:20.166
that these monoliths resonate
on a much more profound level...

04:20.260 --> 04:23.336
and trigger deep-seated
memories of standing stones

04:23.421 --> 04:26.014
erected thousands of years ago?

04:27.425 --> 04:28.842
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS: People
have always been fascinated

04:28.935 --> 04:30.844
with monoliths,

04:30.937 --> 04:33.263
and I think it goes
even deeper into our past,

04:33.356 --> 04:38.110
because we have standing stones
around the world.

04:38.269 --> 04:41.521
Standing stones
have been an integral part

04:41.605 --> 04:46.451
of our human development
over thousands of years.

04:47.787 --> 04:53.366
BRENNAN: Monoliths are a part
of our DNA, part of our psyche.

04:53.459 --> 04:57.796
Stone has a great resonance
within the landscape.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.791
It has a presence of permanence

05:01.884 --> 05:05.378
that outlives the human frame.

05:06.630 --> 05:09.891
NARRATOR: There are more than
50,000 ancient standing stones,

05:09.976 --> 05:12.552
also known as
monoliths or menhirs,

05:12.645 --> 05:15.055
scattered across Europe,

05:15.148 --> 05:19.484
Asia, Africa and the Americas.

05:21.062 --> 05:24.489
Most date back
more than 5,000 years,

05:24.648 --> 05:28.076
and the largest weigh over
300 tons--

05:28.161 --> 05:30.662
More than double the weight
of the Statue of Liberty.

05:31.822 --> 05:33.915
When you look at
these standing stones,

05:34.000 --> 05:36.159
we're looking back
at the Stone Age,

05:36.252 --> 05:39.245
and we're thinking,
are these Stone Age people

05:39.330 --> 05:43.249
moving all of these
huge megaliths around?

05:44.344 --> 05:48.430
The largest standing stone
in all of Europe

05:48.514 --> 05:54.353
is called Le Grand Menhir Brisé,
the Great Broken Menhir.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.597
It's located in French Brittany,

05:57.681 --> 06:00.942
and when it was one solid piece,

06:01.102 --> 06:04.354
it was over 60 feet tall.

06:05.698 --> 06:08.942
They have estimated for that
stone, when it was one piece,

06:09.035 --> 06:12.195
to be 330 tons.

06:12.288 --> 06:16.533
Now explain to me
how you transport 330 tons.

06:16.626 --> 06:20.003
We have a hard time
doing this today.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.215
TRAVIS TAYLOR:
It's a huge undertaking.

06:23.299 --> 06:26.718
And there could have been
some knowledge that they had

06:26.877 --> 06:29.721
to move heavy things that,
for some reason,

06:29.806 --> 06:33.225
we don't understand today in our
modern technological society.

06:33.309 --> 06:37.971
Have we forgotten some
ancient physics that they knew?

06:38.064 --> 06:39.898
Or did they have help?

06:41.484 --> 06:45.237
NARRATOR: While not all
monoliths are of such enormous size,

06:45.321 --> 06:49.816
for ancient astronaut theorists,
the question still remains:

06:49.909 --> 06:54.079
why would prehistoric people,
struggling just to survive,

06:54.163 --> 06:59.159
have expended so much time and
energy erecting standing stones?

06:59.243 --> 07:03.496
CHILDRESS: When you try to
speculate about the standing stones

07:03.581 --> 07:06.332
and what their purpose is,
we have to wonder,

07:06.417 --> 07:08.510
does it have to do with
extraterrestrials

07:08.594 --> 07:12.848
and something technological
that we do not understand?

07:14.100 --> 07:16.518
NARRATOR:
On the northwest coast of France

07:16.602 --> 07:19.104
lies the most famous
and mysterious collection

07:19.188 --> 07:23.525
of ancient standing stones
found anywhere in the world.

07:23.684 --> 07:26.611
Stretching across two miles
of rolling countryside,

07:26.770 --> 07:29.772
the more than
3,000 giant menhirs

07:29.857 --> 07:31.950
are known as the Carnac stones.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.289
French archeologists
have been able to give a date

07:37.448 --> 07:40.625
to these standing stones,
and it's 5,000 BC.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.869
So, they're saying
that these stones

07:42.953 --> 07:46.122
were erected 7,000 years ago,

07:46.215 --> 07:49.125
but they don't know
who erected them.

07:49.218 --> 07:51.970
They don't know
why they were erected.

07:52.129 --> 07:54.380
They don't know how
they moved all these stones

07:54.474 --> 07:55.640
and erected them.

07:56.809 --> 08:00.812
Some of these stones
are as much as ten feet tall.

08:00.971 --> 08:04.816
And they are
arranged in huge alignments.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.644
Some of them
are in parallel lines.

08:07.728 --> 08:09.571
Some of them are fan-like.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.240
The Carnac alignments

08:12.399 --> 08:14.317
refer to rows of stones

08:14.401 --> 08:17.078
that run in precise
lines for long distances

08:17.163 --> 08:18.404
through the landscape.

08:18.489 --> 08:20.665
HUGH NEWMAN:
This is long before Stonehenge,

08:20.750 --> 08:22.167
and Avebury
and other such sites.

08:23.410 --> 08:24.669
So who were these people?

08:24.754 --> 08:28.173
And how were they able to move
up to 70-ton blocks

08:28.332 --> 08:29.666
over huge distances

08:29.759 --> 08:33.512
and lay them out into these
geometric configurations?

08:34.755 --> 08:37.340
NARRATOR:
Some mainstream scholars suggest

08:37.433 --> 08:40.352
that the stones
are simply grave markers,

08:40.511 --> 08:43.179
while others claim
they track astronomical events

08:43.272 --> 08:45.857
like the solstice and equinox.

08:47.101 --> 08:49.694
But neither theory can
explain the precise placement

08:49.779 --> 08:52.614
of the stones
in geometric alignments.

08:54.108 --> 08:56.284
One of the most interesting
of the Carnac alignments

08:56.443 --> 08:57.369
is the alignment of Ménec.

08:58.612 --> 09:00.113
When viewed from above,

09:00.197 --> 09:03.041
we can see these
11 almost perfect parallel lines

09:03.125 --> 09:05.627
that stretch out
for almost a mile.

09:06.787 --> 09:09.289
So the Ménec alignment
is so pristine

09:09.382 --> 09:11.883
and created with such perfection

09:11.968 --> 09:13.051
we can't even imagine

09:13.210 --> 09:15.804
how it would've been done
in ancient times.

09:17.047 --> 09:19.474
Now, we have to wonder
what these lines were for.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.893
We have to wonder why

09:22.052 --> 09:25.063
they're so beautifully viewed
from above.

09:26.732 --> 09:31.644
NARRATOR: In 1970, Alexander
Thom, a Scottish engineer

09:31.737 --> 09:33.980
who spent most of his life
studying megaliths,

09:34.064 --> 09:36.491
performed a survey of Carnac

09:36.576 --> 09:38.735
and found that
the stones appeared to be

09:38.819 --> 09:41.571
purposely arranged to
form geometric designs.

09:42.665 --> 09:46.743
Of particular interest was
an egg-shaped stone formation

09:46.836 --> 09:49.337
at the west end of the Ménec
alignment,

09:49.422 --> 09:51.339
whose stones
were precisely positioned

09:51.424 --> 09:54.426
to form
perfect Pythagorean triangles.

09:56.920 --> 09:59.931
Thom's finding
astonished archaeologists,

10:00.090 --> 10:02.508
due to the fact that
Pythagoras introduced

10:02.593 --> 10:06.187
this geometrical concept
in the sixth century BC,

10:06.347 --> 10:10.400
more than 4,000 years after
the Carnac stones were erected.

10:11.694 --> 10:14.103
TSOUKALOS:
One of the arrangements we have

10:14.188 --> 10:17.857
is a representation
of the Pythagorean theorem,

10:17.950 --> 10:20.952
which is A squared plus
B squared equals C squared.

10:22.121 --> 10:25.365
How do we have
that mathematical message

10:25.458 --> 10:30.795
in a archaeological site
that's at least 7,000 years old?

10:32.048 --> 10:33.539
ERICH VON DANIKEN:
The constructions in Carnac

10:33.633 --> 10:35.634
is thousands of years
older than Pythagoras,

10:35.718 --> 10:37.210
the Greek mathematician.

10:37.294 --> 10:40.805
So somebody must have
teached our ancestors

10:40.890 --> 10:45.551
to put these stones in a certain
line, in geometrical forms.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.562
Now the question is simply, why?

10:47.647 --> 10:51.057
I am absolutely sure, some
thousands of years in the past,

10:51.141 --> 10:53.151
the extraterrestrials
who visited our planet

10:53.310 --> 10:55.737
left a proof behind.

10:56.897 --> 10:59.816
TSOUKALOS: It's a message
that somebody was here

10:59.900 --> 11:03.319
in the past who instructed
our Stone Age people

11:03.404 --> 11:06.081
to put this stone here,
put that stone there.

11:07.324 --> 11:09.334
NARRATOR: Is it
possible that the positioning

11:09.493 --> 11:10.585
of the Carnac stones

11:10.670 --> 11:13.663
was directed
by extraterrestrial visitors,

11:13.756 --> 11:16.833
as ancient astronaut theorists
suggest?

11:16.917 --> 11:18.918
But if so, was the intent

11:19.002 --> 11:21.513
simply to leave clues
that they were here?

11:22.515 --> 11:24.849
Or might these standing stones,

11:25.008 --> 11:27.844
and the thousands of others
that exist across the world,

11:27.928 --> 11:31.022
have served another purpose?

11:31.107 --> 11:32.181
One that can be found

11:32.266 --> 11:35.276
not by looking at the stones
from above

11:35.361 --> 11:38.530
but by understanding
what lies beneath.

11:49.208 --> 11:52.535
Pierre Mereaux, a French
engineer in thermodynamics,

11:52.628 --> 11:55.538
performs a study
of the Carnac stones,

11:55.631 --> 11:59.384
which produces some
highly intriguing results.

11:59.468 --> 12:01.878
CHILDRESS:
What he found was that

12:01.971 --> 12:06.215
the stones were aligned
and placed over areas

12:06.300 --> 12:09.051
that had quartz fissures.

12:09.136 --> 12:13.022
The standing stones, themselves,
are also made of quartz.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.475
Now these stones,
as I understand it,

12:15.568 --> 12:16.651
have a fair amount of quartz,

12:16.736 --> 12:18.811
and quartz
is an interesting material...

12:19.989 --> 12:23.483
because we do connect
it with piezoelectricity.

12:23.567 --> 12:27.737
NARRATOR: Piezoelectricity is
the process of generating electricity

12:27.821 --> 12:29.998
from crystals, like quartz,

12:30.157 --> 12:32.333
when they are placed
under pressure.

12:32.418 --> 12:35.578
This technology
is used today in watches,

12:35.671 --> 12:38.381
speakers
and computer storage systems.

12:41.168 --> 12:42.343
But in order for the stones

12:42.503 --> 12:45.922
found in the Carnac region
to generate a charge,

12:46.006 --> 12:49.350
they would need to be stimulated
by a tremendous amount of force.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.847
NEWMAN: When studying
the landscape of Carnac,

12:54.940 --> 12:58.026
Pierre Mereaux found fault zones

12:58.110 --> 13:01.187
which the stone avenues
appeared to be aligned to.

13:02.523 --> 13:06.192
TAYLOR: It's really interesting,
if there was tectonic movement,

13:06.285 --> 13:08.369
the quartz could be stimulated

13:08.529 --> 13:12.698
to create a release of energy,
using the piezoelectric effect.

13:13.951 --> 13:17.203
And these stones are standing
in just the right locations

13:17.287 --> 13:19.631
where you could create
a phenomena like this.

13:19.790 --> 13:23.125
You can store and create
electromagnetic energy

13:23.210 --> 13:25.470
in these types of stones.

13:27.214 --> 13:29.724
NARRATOR: In addition to
being placed over a fault line,

13:29.883 --> 13:31.476
there is also the presence

13:31.635 --> 13:33.719
of a strong and measurable
"Earth energy"

13:33.813 --> 13:35.605
that lies beneath the stones.

13:37.641 --> 13:40.309
So, one of the cool things
about the Earth

13:40.394 --> 13:41.894
is the currents that exist.

13:41.979 --> 13:43.729
And it's something
we don't think about a lot

13:43.823 --> 13:45.064
is that underneath the earth,

13:45.148 --> 13:46.482
and the crust, and the mantle

13:46.567 --> 13:48.243
and in the oceans and the water

13:48.327 --> 13:50.903
there's constant
electric current flowing.

13:50.996 --> 13:54.415
Some of it very reproduceable
and very steady.

13:54.500 --> 13:59.170
It seems as if the Carnac stones
somehow were reflecting

13:59.329 --> 14:03.341
the presence of these electrical
currents beneath the earth,

14:03.425 --> 14:07.679
almost as if the prehistoric
peoples that created them

14:07.838 --> 14:11.257
were aware of the subtle
energies of the earth.

14:12.593 --> 14:16.020
TAYLOR: Somebody understood
something about the quartz in the ground,

14:16.179 --> 14:17.355
the standing stones
and the fault line.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.099
It's too big of a coincidence

14:20.183 --> 14:22.110
for them not
to have understood that.

14:23.437 --> 14:26.022
TSOUKALOS: I think in Carnac,
our ancestors

14:26.115 --> 14:27.940
did not know
what they were creating.

14:28.025 --> 14:31.369
The entire region
has over 4,000 stones.

14:32.621 --> 14:37.199
And, of course, it was our human
ancestors who moved that stone.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.952
It was not aliens
who moved the stone.

14:40.045 --> 14:44.465
But somebody told our ancestors
why to move it there,

14:44.550 --> 14:47.385
and above all,
how to move it there.

14:47.469 --> 14:53.850
Carnac, at some point, was
an extraterrestrial hot spot.

14:55.636 --> 14:59.230
NARRATOR: Were the stones at
Carnac part of an electrical grid?

14:59.389 --> 15:02.808
One that was created
by extraterrestrial visitors

15:02.902 --> 15:06.228
to tap into the natural energy
produced by the earth?

15:06.313 --> 15:09.032
But if so, to what end?

15:10.159 --> 15:12.234
Perhaps further clues
can be found

15:12.328 --> 15:14.904
by examining
some of the strange events

15:14.988 --> 15:18.082
that have occurred
near ancient standing stones.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.420
Rudston, England.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.749
This ancient village
in Yorkshire

15:26.833 --> 15:30.094
has been inhabited
for more than 5,000 years,

15:30.179 --> 15:33.848
and several of its Neolithic
structures are still standing...

15:35.008 --> 15:37.018
as well as
a number of monoliths.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.563
But one towers above the rest.

15:41.765 --> 15:43.274
The Rudston Monolith

15:43.433 --> 15:46.277
is the tallest standing stone
in Britain.

15:46.362 --> 15:50.022
Currently,
it is 25 feet in height,

15:50.115 --> 15:52.617
and it weighs 40 tons.

15:52.776 --> 15:56.862
Some researchers say
that the monolith was found

15:56.956 --> 16:01.701
at Cayton Bay, which is
about 10 miles from Rudston,

16:01.785 --> 16:04.921
and was carried up
onto the hill.

16:06.131 --> 16:09.375
So the effort involved
to try to lift the stone

16:09.459 --> 16:13.137
in an upright position
is beyond imagination.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.718
NARRATOR: Archaeologists
believe the Rudston Monolith

16:18.811 --> 16:22.388
dates back to at least 2,500 BC.

16:23.565 --> 16:27.318
But some point to evidence
that it could be far older.

16:27.477 --> 16:31.823
BRENNAN: Well, we know that
people have lived nearby Rudston

16:31.907 --> 16:35.234
for over 11,000 years, uh,

16:35.327 --> 16:37.662
in the Mesolithic era.

16:37.746 --> 16:40.498
Because there have been
some fantastic excavations

16:40.657 --> 16:46.328
which have revealed the oldest
house dwelling in the U.K.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.841
So the Rudston Monolith
could be as old as that.

16:53.762 --> 16:57.923
NARRATOR: If the Rudston
Monolith really is 11,000 years old,

16:58.017 --> 17:00.593
that would mean
it was transported and erected

17:00.686 --> 17:04.022
some 6,000 years before
the invention of the wheel.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.524
And according
to local historians,

17:06.608 --> 17:08.943
just as mysterious
as the origins

17:09.028 --> 17:12.697
of the giant standing stone,
is the strange phenomena

17:12.781 --> 17:15.691
that have been observed
in the area for centuries.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.287
This particular area
of the world is known

17:19.371 --> 17:22.281
as the Bermuda Triangle
of East Yorkshire,

17:22.365 --> 17:24.876
and there's a multitude
of strange phenomena

17:25.035 --> 17:26.878
that people report.

17:26.962 --> 17:29.955
Strange lights
and odd occurrences

17:30.049 --> 17:32.050
in the sky and on the ground.

17:33.293 --> 17:36.387
BRENNAN: We have reports
of high strangeness in the region

17:36.472 --> 17:39.390
dating back
to the tenth century.

17:40.550 --> 17:43.144
We have accounts
of lights in the sky.

17:44.304 --> 17:47.231
Intelligent light forms
that seem to have a purpose

17:47.316 --> 17:48.900
and a will of their own.

17:50.402 --> 17:54.072
People get electric shocks
off the Rudston Monolith.

17:54.156 --> 17:56.482
They have altered states,
experiences.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.654
ERIN KAVANAGH: People claim to
have seen green-skinned fairy-like folk

18:01.747 --> 18:03.906
scuttling around the Rudston.

18:05.158 --> 18:08.586
TSOUKALOS: Aerial phenomena
are reported in that region.

18:08.670 --> 18:10.830
Lights in the sky,

18:10.914 --> 18:14.008
weird things that happen
to electronic equipment,

18:14.167 --> 18:16.502
weird magnetic anomalies.

18:16.586 --> 18:19.755
So clearly, there is
something going on there.

18:21.266 --> 18:24.519
CHILDRESS: So you have to
wonder, is the Rudston Monolith there

18:24.678 --> 18:27.346
because of all these
strange effects?

18:27.430 --> 18:29.774
Or perhaps,
the Rudston Monolith itself

18:29.933 --> 18:32.110
is helping create
some of these effects.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.021
NARRATOR: But how could
an ancient standing stone

18:36.106 --> 18:38.950
be the source of
such unusual phenomena?

18:39.109 --> 18:41.702
Are earth energies
being amplified

18:41.862 --> 18:44.288
by the monolith
just like at Carnac?

18:46.616 --> 18:49.794
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes, and suggest

18:49.953 --> 18:53.965
there is far more to the Rudston
Monolith than meets the eye.

19:01.473 --> 19:05.309
NARRATOR: In the early 1700s,
English scholar William Stukeley

19:05.468 --> 19:07.895
conducted an excavation
at the site

19:07.980 --> 19:09.638
of the Rudston Monolith,

19:09.723 --> 19:12.650
and discovered that the rock
was twice as large

19:12.734 --> 19:16.612
as previously thought, with
half of it lodged in the earth.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.741
HUTCHINSON: What's interesting
about Rudston Monolith,

19:20.901 --> 19:25.496
they discovered this extension
of the stone went 25 feet

19:25.655 --> 19:30.242
below the surface, as well
as 25 feet above the surface.

19:30.335 --> 19:33.421
This is what makes this monolith

19:33.505 --> 19:36.299
the largest standing stone
in Britain.

19:37.334 --> 19:38.834
CHILDRESS:
What was the purpose?

19:38.919 --> 19:40.761
I mean, it's a lot of effort

19:40.846 --> 19:42.680
that they're doing
for no real reason

19:42.764 --> 19:45.090
that we can gather.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.019
It seems that they're
tapping into certain places

19:48.103 --> 19:50.354
where this energy
from the earth can

19:50.439 --> 19:53.941
be gathered,
and then somehow emitted.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.694
NARRATOR: Could it be that
the ancient people embedded

19:56.853 --> 20:01.115
this 50-foot-tall stone a full
25 feet deep in the ground

20:01.274 --> 20:04.610
as an attempt to
tap into earth energies?

20:04.703 --> 20:07.780
Curiously, the Rudston Monolith,

20:07.864 --> 20:11.116
like the Carnac stones
in France, is composed

20:11.210 --> 20:14.629
primarily of highly
conductive quartz crystal.

20:14.713 --> 20:18.290
HUTCHINSON:
The monolith is gritstone.

20:18.375 --> 20:21.377
And gritstone is
a conglomerate of sandstone,

20:21.470 --> 20:26.224
with large grains of
quartz-like sand.

20:26.383 --> 20:29.894
Gritstone has a high
degree of conductivity

20:29.978 --> 20:33.731
because of
the electromagnetic frequencies

20:33.890 --> 20:36.067
that quartz
can contain in some stones.

20:37.060 --> 20:39.195
So, it is a conductor of energy.

20:40.897 --> 20:44.316
NARRATOR: And also like
Carnac, Rudston is a location where

20:44.401 --> 20:46.244
there are strong earth energies.

20:46.328 --> 20:48.913
Some suspect this is due,
in part,

20:49.072 --> 20:51.499
to the presence
of the Gypsy Race River

20:51.583 --> 20:54.326
that runs
beneath the earth here.

20:54.419 --> 20:58.506
The Gypsy Race is a type of
river that flows above ground,

20:58.590 --> 21:00.925
then underground,
then above ground again,

21:01.009 --> 21:04.670
weaving in and out of the earth
rather like a giant worm.

21:04.763 --> 21:09.100
The Gypsy Race River is
known as the Waters of Woe,

21:09.184 --> 21:11.844
because it's said to flood
before calamity strikes,

21:11.937 --> 21:16.274
such as a war, famine or plague.

21:16.433 --> 21:21.028
One of the times in which
the Rudston Gypsy Race flooded

21:21.187 --> 21:24.949
was just before
a meteorite struck.

21:25.108 --> 21:29.695
It's hardly surprising that
people think the Gypsy Race

21:29.779 --> 21:34.033
leads rise to
energy vortices in the earth.

21:35.460 --> 21:38.871
NARRATOR: Rudston is also
believed to be at a convergence point

21:38.955 --> 21:40.956
of what are known as ley lines.

21:41.041 --> 21:44.635
In the 1920s,
English landscape photographer

21:44.794 --> 21:47.880
Alfred Watkins
made the curious discovery

21:47.964 --> 21:50.224
that many of the
prehistoric standing stones

21:50.383 --> 21:52.718
and significant
ancient sites of England

21:52.802 --> 21:56.439
and France line up in
perfectly straight lines.

21:57.566 --> 21:59.224
Other researchers have
since theorized

21:59.318 --> 22:02.061
that the ancient people
placed standing stones

22:02.154 --> 22:04.655
and structures along these lines

22:04.740 --> 22:08.492
because they were somehow aware
of underlying energy currents.

22:10.987 --> 22:14.165
I think the ancients
followed a line of energy...

22:16.168 --> 22:19.670
and placed certain
monuments and monolith stones

22:19.829 --> 22:21.839
that could activate
those lines of energy.

22:23.008 --> 22:26.168
CHILDRESS: The Rudston
Monolith apparently is at

22:26.261 --> 22:29.421
a junction of three ley lines.

22:29.506 --> 22:33.425
And there's an energy
associated with these.

22:33.518 --> 22:36.187
It's a subtle energy,
but it's there and it can be

22:36.271 --> 22:39.106
amplified by
these standing stones.

22:43.436 --> 22:47.531
Was the Rudston Monolith erected
by ancient people who were aware

22:47.690 --> 22:50.451
that this is a place
of powerful earth energy?

22:51.703 --> 22:54.863
Or is it possible, as ancient
astronaut theorists believe,

22:54.956 --> 22:58.534
that they were directed
by otherworldly visitors?

22:58.627 --> 23:01.286
NEWMAN: The ancients
knew what they were doing.

23:01.371 --> 23:04.039
They would place these stones
in specific spots.

23:04.124 --> 23:05.966
And it would affect the energy.

23:06.051 --> 23:09.211
But were they working
with other beings to do this?

23:09.304 --> 23:10.796
We have to ask
these kind of questions

23:10.889 --> 23:12.473
because why would they do it?

23:13.716 --> 23:16.385
There's so much energy that
is being recorded at these sites

23:16.478 --> 23:18.220
that we have to look
at this seriously.

23:19.556 --> 23:22.566
COLLINS: It seems as if it was
the result of some kind of

23:22.651 --> 23:27.071
contact with entities,
perhaps even extraterrestrials.

23:29.399 --> 23:32.568
NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut
theorists point out that although no

23:32.652 --> 23:35.663
written records exist
to document the origins of

23:35.747 --> 23:39.491
the prehistoric standing
stones found around the world,

23:39.576 --> 23:41.660
many of the ancient
cultures attributed them

23:41.744 --> 23:43.587
to otherworldly beings.

23:46.758 --> 23:49.593
In Wiltshire, England,
legend says that the monoliths

23:49.752 --> 23:52.763
of Stonehenge were
erected by the magician

23:52.848 --> 23:55.057
Merlin,
who was not of this Earth.

23:56.351 --> 23:58.594
McGOWAN: The great
20th-century French philosopher

23:58.678 --> 24:00.271
and historian, Jean Marcel,

24:00.430 --> 24:03.599
wrote over 40 books
on the Celtic traditions.

24:03.683 --> 24:05.943
- (thunder crashes)
- And was adamant that Merlin was

24:06.102 --> 24:09.354
an incredibly powerful
otherworldly being.

24:09.439 --> 24:11.857
And in a number of
the legends Merlin brought

24:11.941 --> 24:14.943
the understanding of
how to utilize these stones

24:15.036 --> 24:19.031
in some extraordinary way
in terms of technology,

24:19.115 --> 24:20.958
communications, energy.

24:22.202 --> 24:24.786
Now also in
the Breton legends of Carnac,

24:24.871 --> 24:27.289
Michael the Archangel
comes down to Earth incarnate

24:27.382 --> 24:30.551
and brings this
extraordinary information

24:30.710 --> 24:34.305
to this very
powerful place to build

24:34.389 --> 24:37.808
these alignments that occur
at Carnac to create the energy,

24:37.967 --> 24:41.312
to harness the energy,
to utilize it in some way.

24:43.231 --> 24:45.483
NARRATOR:
For ancient astronaut theorists,

24:45.567 --> 24:49.144
the most compelling account
of all comes from Ireland.

24:49.229 --> 24:50.729
According to Celtic legend,

24:50.822 --> 24:52.490
the Lia Fáil--

24:52.649 --> 24:55.567
A sacred stone used
in the coronation of kings--

24:55.660 --> 24:58.570
Was placed on the Hill of Tara
by mysterious beings

24:58.655 --> 25:00.956
known as the Tuatha Dé Danann.

25:02.751 --> 25:04.001
KAVANAGH:
They were said to appear

25:04.085 --> 25:07.254
on mountaintops
amidst dark clouds

25:07.413 --> 25:10.007
floating down in ships
from the sky.

25:11.009 --> 25:12.918
And they brought great knowledge

25:13.002 --> 25:15.346
of the architecture,
metalworking

25:15.430 --> 25:17.422
and medicine to Ireland.

25:17.516 --> 25:20.676
In Irish tradition,
the Tuatha Dé Danann possessed

25:20.769 --> 25:23.595
godlike powers,
but they were mortals.

25:23.688 --> 25:27.024
And so you wonder, what
are they talking about here?

25:27.108 --> 25:29.685
NEWMAN: Lia Fáil arrived
with the Tuatha Dé Danann.

25:29.769 --> 25:32.604
So it has this mystical
kind of history

25:32.697 --> 25:35.533
that goes way, way back,
potentially thousands of years.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.860
NARRATOR: Is it
possible that these stories

25:38.954 --> 25:41.280
of otherworldly visitations

25:41.373 --> 25:46.126
are not merely mythology
but are based on actual events?

25:46.286 --> 25:49.204
And were standing stones
carefully placed

25:49.289 --> 25:51.173
for some energetic purpose?

25:52.375 --> 25:55.135
Perhaps the answer can be found
by examining

25:55.220 --> 25:59.223
our own modern-day efforts to
harness the power of the earth.

25:59.382 --> 26:01.225
(crackling)

26:07.816 --> 26:09.400
NARRATOR:
Long Island, New York.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.736
March 1901.

26:14.981 --> 26:17.324
After years of experimentation,

26:17.409 --> 26:19.910
famed engineer and inventor,
Nikola Tesla,

26:20.069 --> 26:22.821
begins construction
on the Wardenclyffe Tower

26:22.914 --> 26:25.741
outside the town of Shoreham.

26:25.825 --> 26:27.826
The project is an attempt

26:27.919 --> 26:30.921
to wirelessly transmit
electricity through the ground.

26:33.675 --> 26:36.927
TAYLOR: Tesla invented almost
everything that brought forward

26:37.086 --> 26:39.921
our modern society
with electrical power.

26:40.015 --> 26:43.934
And his idea was
to power the world wirelessly,

26:44.093 --> 26:46.270
without having to have
this big infrastructure.

26:46.429 --> 26:47.771
All they would need was towers
around the world.

26:48.931 --> 26:52.267
His biggest test was
at Wardenclyffe in Long Island,

26:52.352 --> 26:57.272
and it was a large tower
that has a strange ray conductor

26:57.365 --> 27:00.025
on top of it, and then
a large conducting pipe

27:00.118 --> 27:03.111
that went way deep into
the granite basin underneath it.

27:03.196 --> 27:05.372
What he was really doing was
grounding his system

27:05.457 --> 27:07.866
into the earth, electrically
connecting it to the earth

27:07.959 --> 27:10.711
- and transmitting power around the Earth.
- (crackling)

27:10.795 --> 27:13.297
And there are minerals and salts
and things in the ground

27:13.456 --> 27:14.623
that are conductive.

27:14.716 --> 27:17.301
And you can actually pass
electromagnetic energy--

27:17.460 --> 27:19.637
Electrical current--
Through the ground.

27:19.721 --> 27:22.473
His plan was to send wireless
power through the earth,

27:22.557 --> 27:24.475
uh, over vast distances.

27:26.311 --> 27:29.563
NARRATOR: Tesla's dream of
harnessing the natural electricity

27:29.648 --> 27:32.900
of the earth to broadcast
wireless power was cut short

27:32.984 --> 27:37.145
when he lost funding in 1904
and abandoned the project.

27:38.314 --> 27:40.816
But another experiment
he secretly conducted

27:40.909 --> 27:43.911
in Colorado Springs
five years earlier

27:43.995 --> 27:46.497
allegedly proved
the technology could work.

27:48.574 --> 27:50.575
During the test,
Tesla placed light bulbs

27:50.660 --> 27:53.504
attached to metal conductors
into the ground

27:53.663 --> 27:55.497
as much as 26 miles

27:55.581 --> 27:58.092
from the power source
in his laboratory.

27:58.251 --> 28:02.254
He then signaled his assistant
to turn on the wireless system

28:02.347 --> 28:05.641
and watched as the light bulbs
became illuminated.

28:07.009 --> 28:09.594
He actually lit light bulbs
many miles away

28:09.688 --> 28:11.179
with his experiment in Colorado.

28:11.264 --> 28:14.525
And this was implementing

28:14.609 --> 28:19.279
the electrical conductivity
of the earth in a way that

28:19.364 --> 28:21.615
nobody else has really been able
to do efficiently since then.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.942
NARRATOR:
More than a century later,

28:24.026 --> 28:27.112
scientists are still
attempting to replicate

28:27.196 --> 28:30.708
what Tesla was able to achieve
in Colorado.

28:30.867 --> 28:34.453
But is it possible
that he was not the first

28:34.546 --> 28:36.880
to conceive of drawing
electricity from the earth?

28:38.875 --> 28:40.884
When we think about
what Tesla was doing

28:41.043 --> 28:43.795
with his Wardenclyffe Tower,
and we compare that

28:43.880 --> 28:46.640
with what we see
at standing stones like Carnac,

28:46.725 --> 28:49.050
we have to wonder
if the ancients were

28:49.144 --> 28:51.136
trying to create
some sort of electrical system

28:51.220 --> 28:53.397
similar to
what Tesla was proposing.

28:55.057 --> 28:58.402
NARRATOR: When thermodynamics
engineer Pierre Mereaux

28:58.561 --> 29:02.239
studied the Carnac stones
in France in 1992,

29:02.398 --> 29:05.576
he concluded that they do,
in fact, store energy

29:05.660 --> 29:07.494
by connecting to
an electric source

29:07.653 --> 29:10.164
just below the surface
of the earth,

29:10.248 --> 29:12.491
much like Tesla's
Wardenclyffe Tower.

29:13.668 --> 29:17.421
But if the ancient people
were placing standing stones

29:17.580 --> 29:20.499
in order to tap into
Earth's energy currents,

29:20.583 --> 29:23.594
what exactly were they using
this energy for?

29:24.846 --> 29:28.340
Energy can be amplified
by these standing stones.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.768
And it can be emitted as well.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.354
Much like we use antennas,
and towers,

29:34.439 --> 29:37.191
radio towers
and things like that.

29:37.350 --> 29:39.193
We have to wonder,
does it have to do

29:39.277 --> 29:42.613
with extraterrestrials
and spacecraft?

29:42.772 --> 29:45.949
Some have suggested that
these standing stones

29:46.034 --> 29:49.536
may have been used
as a fuel device

29:49.695 --> 29:52.447
for some type of craft.

29:52.532 --> 29:56.451
And while at first
this sounds absolutely insane,

29:56.536 --> 29:59.463
the more you think about it,
the more it makes sense.

29:59.547 --> 30:02.716
A Soviet scientist
by the name of Kardashev

30:02.875 --> 30:04.551
came up with a scale

30:04.636 --> 30:08.713
where the advancement
of a society

30:08.807 --> 30:12.217
is determined by its energy use.

30:12.310 --> 30:16.563
So, what if somebody came here
who has been around

30:16.648 --> 30:19.900
longer than us
and has figured out

30:19.984 --> 30:23.070
how to harness
the energy of the planet

30:23.229 --> 30:26.231
through use of standing stones?

30:27.650 --> 30:31.662
TAYLOR: Now just imagine
that you're on a long trip.

30:31.746 --> 30:34.998
And you have
an electric vehicle.

30:35.157 --> 30:38.159
And when you leave your house,
you plan your trip

30:38.253 --> 30:41.580
around places that you know
you can recharge.

30:41.673 --> 30:46.009
Well, now imagine that
you're an advanced civilization.

30:46.094 --> 30:49.012
And you're going to
a new planet.

30:49.171 --> 30:51.339
But you understand
planetary physics

30:51.424 --> 30:54.601
and that planets will generate
certain locations

30:54.760 --> 30:58.263
that have more electromagnetic
anomalies than others.

30:58.347 --> 31:00.607
That might be a fueling station.

31:00.766 --> 31:03.935
Would they leave
a marker that says,

31:04.028 --> 31:06.187
"Fuel here"?
Maybe they would.

31:07.440 --> 31:10.450
CHILDRESS: It's interesting
that flying saucers are

31:10.610 --> 31:15.289
very commonly seen around
power lines and power plants.

31:15.448 --> 31:16.781
But in ancient times
they didn't have

31:16.866 --> 31:19.376
those power lines running
all over the world.

31:19.460 --> 31:21.879
But what they did have were
these standing stones.

31:22.038 --> 31:26.291
So, extraterrestrials can take
the stored energy

31:26.384 --> 31:28.886
that's in these standing stones,

31:29.045 --> 31:33.390
recharge their own craft
and then fly on

31:33.549 --> 31:36.226
to an-another one of
these standing stones somewhere.

31:37.645 --> 31:40.138
NARRATOR: Could this
be the answer to the mystery

31:40.222 --> 31:41.565
of the standing stones?

31:41.724 --> 31:45.226
Did alien visitors instruct
our ancestors

31:45.311 --> 31:47.988
on where to place them
so that they could tap

31:48.072 --> 31:51.983
into the Earth's natural energy
to charge their craft?

31:52.076 --> 31:55.996
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

31:56.155 --> 31:58.832
the answer is a resounding yes.

31:58.991 --> 32:02.002
But they suggest
this technology was used

32:02.086 --> 32:04.412
for far greater purposes

32:04.497 --> 32:08.884
and claim the proof can be found
in ancient Egypt.

32:17.352 --> 32:18.435
NARRATOR:
Cairo, Egypt

32:21.940 --> 32:25.609
20 miles northeast of
the iconic Giza Pyramid Complex

32:25.768 --> 32:29.863
stands the world's
oldest surviving obelisk,

32:30.022 --> 32:32.741
dating to roughly 1900 BC.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.204
Originating from
the Greek<i> obeliskos,</i>

32:37.363 --> 32:40.532
meaning "pointed pillar,"
an obelisk is

32:40.616 --> 32:43.377
a tall, four-sided,
narrow tapering monument

32:43.461 --> 32:45.963
which ends in a pyramidion
at the top.

32:46.047 --> 32:48.966
In Egypt,
hieroglyphs were carved

32:49.125 --> 32:52.544
into all four sides,
and they often recorded battles,

32:52.637 --> 32:56.214
special events,
or the history of the region.

32:56.298 --> 33:00.394
CHILDRESS: The obelisks of
Egypt were erected maybe centuries

33:00.478 --> 33:03.647
after standing stones like
the ones in Carnac in Brittany.

33:03.731 --> 33:07.726
But they're monoliths, too--
One solid piece of stone.

33:08.820 --> 33:12.480
The obelisks of Egypt, too,
are made of red granite,

33:12.573 --> 33:16.076
and red granite is
a very special kind of granite.

33:16.160 --> 33:20.238
It's infused
with tiny quartz crystals.

33:20.331 --> 33:25.669
And this gives the obelisk
a certain type of energy,

33:25.828 --> 33:29.256
and the ancient peoples were
aware of this energy

33:29.415 --> 33:32.751
that was coming out
of the obelisk.

33:32.835 --> 33:36.337
They actually thought
the obelisk was alive.

33:36.422 --> 33:38.423
And this is very reminiscent

33:38.516 --> 33:41.685
of the ancient standing stones
that are even older.

33:42.937 --> 33:45.346
NARRATOR:
Is it more than mere coincidence

33:45.431 --> 33:48.025
that the Egyptians erected
monolithic stones

33:48.184 --> 33:50.277
that were rich
in quartz crystal,

33:50.361 --> 33:53.855
just like ancient cultures
in other parts of the world did

33:53.939 --> 33:55.532
thousands of years earlier?

33:56.784 --> 34:00.537
Had they discovered the secret
of the ancient standing stones,

34:00.621 --> 34:03.457
and their power to harness
the energy of the Earth?

34:03.616 --> 34:07.044
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

34:07.203 --> 34:09.621
and point out that
the Egyptians believed

34:09.714 --> 34:13.842
the obelisks provided a profound
connection to the gods.

34:14.969 --> 34:16.878
The obelisk itself,
like a cathedral,

34:16.962 --> 34:18.630
lifts up into the heavens.

34:18.714 --> 34:20.640
It is pointing to the heavens.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.634
It is a connection to the gods.

34:23.811 --> 34:26.229
And at the top of an obelisk
in ancient Egypt,

34:26.314 --> 34:29.140
there was a special stone,
the capstone, the pyramidion.

34:29.233 --> 34:30.984
It was the shape of a pyramid.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.570
It was made of
specially fine granite,

34:33.729 --> 34:36.981
polished with
some, uh, hieroglyphics,

34:37.066 --> 34:41.328
but the main detail was it was
brightly gilded in pure gold,

34:41.412 --> 34:45.248
so that the sun would bounce off
that and beams would glow

34:45.333 --> 34:46.825
for miles around it.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.243
Must've been dazzling.

34:49.420 --> 34:53.164
This was the point of contact
between humans and the gods.

34:53.249 --> 34:56.259
This was how we communicated
with the gods

34:56.418 --> 34:58.169
through that stone.

34:58.254 --> 35:00.338
HENRY: You'll see
the top of the obelisk

35:00.431 --> 35:02.090
reaching into the sky.

35:02.174 --> 35:05.602
They think of it as a sort of,
uh, an axis mundi.

35:05.761 --> 35:08.680
It's a way of connecting Earth
with the heavens.

35:08.764 --> 35:12.016
Egypt was given,
according to ancient texts,

35:12.110 --> 35:13.360
the powers of heaven.

35:14.529 --> 35:18.115
Egypt became a mirror
of the heavens,

35:18.199 --> 35:21.526
and that the powers
that are found in the heavens

35:21.610 --> 35:23.453
are found on Earth, in Egypt.

35:23.538 --> 35:25.247
As above, so below.

35:26.448 --> 35:28.208
NARRATOR:
Mainstream scholars interpret

35:28.292 --> 35:31.628
this connection to the heavens
as purely symbolic,

35:31.787 --> 35:34.289
but ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

35:34.373 --> 35:37.375
that the obelisks were
recreating the technology

35:37.468 --> 35:40.470
of another world, and that
these giant stone pillars

35:40.629 --> 35:43.548
were part of
a vast wireless energy grid,

35:43.641 --> 35:47.394
one that also incorporated
the power of the pyramids.

35:48.729 --> 35:53.483
It's a fascinating idea that
like we would charge a phone

35:53.642 --> 35:56.227
on a charging pad
just by placing it there,

35:56.320 --> 36:01.324
these extraterrestrials can
recharge their own craft

36:01.483 --> 36:03.952
off of these standing stones
and obelisks.

36:05.079 --> 36:07.155
You have to wonder
whether pyramids had

36:07.239 --> 36:08.915
exactly the same purpose.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.994
Could there be even more
highly advanced technology

36:13.078 --> 36:15.922
way beyond any technology
that we even know?

36:18.167 --> 36:19.509
A lot of people don't
realize this,

36:19.594 --> 36:23.096
but Tesla's original design
for the Wardenclyffe Tower

36:23.181 --> 36:25.173
was actually to be
the same height

36:25.257 --> 36:28.426
as is the pyramid
from the base to the tip of

36:28.519 --> 36:31.188
where that conductor piece used
to be on top of the pyramids.

36:31.347 --> 36:33.514
And at the time
that he was building it,

36:33.599 --> 36:36.851
in the 1908-ish timeframe,

36:36.944 --> 36:39.613
J.P. Morgan had
an expedition in the pyramids

36:39.772 --> 36:42.023
and were sending information
to Tesla

36:42.116 --> 36:44.442
while he was working
on the Wardenclyffe Tower.

36:44.535 --> 36:47.204
Nobody knows why and what
the results of that was

36:47.288 --> 36:48.446
and to what end.

36:48.539 --> 36:53.284
But it seems suspect
that Tesla wanted to do

36:53.377 --> 36:55.703
something with wireless
transmission of power

36:55.788 --> 36:59.549
from a system that's
the same height as the pyramids.

36:59.634 --> 37:01.793
Did they believe that that's
what the pyramids were for?

37:03.128 --> 37:06.047
NARRATOR: The walls of the
Great Pyramid-- like the obelisks--

37:06.131 --> 37:09.884
Contain a high concentration
of quartz crystal.

37:09.969 --> 37:12.303
Could it be that this massive
monument,

37:12.388 --> 37:13.897
in conjunction
with the obelisks,

37:14.056 --> 37:17.558
made up a global
wireless energy network?

37:18.811 --> 37:22.230
By placing some of these
obelisks and standing stones

37:22.314 --> 37:24.824
around the Earth,
in combination with pyramids,

37:24.984 --> 37:26.409
if you have
the correct technology,

37:26.494 --> 37:27.902
you can use that energy,

37:27.995 --> 37:30.497
and these standing stones
become antennas

37:30.581 --> 37:33.833
and power beacons
and all kinds of things.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.827
And it seems that
this could have been

37:35.911 --> 37:38.830
a worldwide system of power.

37:38.914 --> 37:42.667
And that spacecraft, submarines,

37:42.751 --> 37:45.929
other electric devices
could draw their power

37:46.088 --> 37:49.090
from the atmosphere
because it was being put out

37:49.174 --> 37:52.852
by these pyramids
and by these obelisks.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.931
NARRATOR: Might the world
that Nikola Tesla envisioned

37:57.024 --> 37:58.608
at the beginning
of the 20 century

37:58.767 --> 38:01.695
have actually existed
right here on Earth

38:01.854 --> 38:03.780
thousands of years ago?

38:03.939 --> 38:06.783
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

38:06.942 --> 38:09.286
and suggest there is
even evidence

38:09.445 --> 38:10.870
that parts of
this wireless energy system

38:11.030 --> 38:13.581
may still be in use today.

38:22.041 --> 38:23.466
NARRATOR:
Tara, Ireland.

38:25.886 --> 38:29.139
Continuing
a 6,000-year-old tradition,

38:29.223 --> 38:31.641
thousands congregate
on the Hill of Tara every June

38:31.800 --> 38:34.477
to celebrate
the summer solstice,

38:34.562 --> 38:38.648
and gather around the sacred
stone called Lia Fáil.

38:38.733 --> 38:41.234
In Axum, Ethiopia,

38:41.319 --> 38:43.069
the ancient granite obelisks
attract

38:43.154 --> 38:46.573
more than 20,000 tourists
every year.

38:46.732 --> 38:50.660
And more than 800,000 tourists
will visit Wiltshire, England

38:50.819 --> 38:54.739
this year, to gaze upon the
iconic monoliths of Stonehenge.

38:55.916 --> 38:59.419
After thousands of years,
humankind remains mesmerized

38:59.578 --> 39:02.005
by the ancient standing stones.

39:03.165 --> 39:06.501
There's just some energy
and mystery

39:06.585 --> 39:11.181
that's associated with them
that really grabs humans

39:11.265 --> 39:15.009
to the point where all of
these places today are now

39:15.102 --> 39:19.189
major sacred places
and tourist spots.

39:19.273 --> 39:21.608
Was it something that
the extraterrestrials had set up

39:21.767 --> 39:25.278
and has now, uh, fallen
into disuse?

39:25.363 --> 39:29.783
A giant matrix
and grid around the Earth

39:29.867 --> 39:33.111
that was functioning
in ancient times,

39:33.195 --> 39:36.030
and now all we have is just
sort of remnants

39:36.115 --> 39:38.875
of this ancient power grid

39:39.034 --> 39:41.702
that was once
completely around the Earth?

39:41.787 --> 39:42.962
It's a fantastic thought.

39:44.882 --> 39:48.709
NARRATOR: But considering the
geological makeup of these ancient stones

39:48.794 --> 39:51.629
and their potential
for transmitting energy,

39:51.713 --> 39:53.548
is it possible
that they are more

39:53.632 --> 39:56.801
than just majestic monuments
to the past?

39:56.885 --> 39:59.062
Could otherworldly visitors
be drawing power

39:59.221 --> 40:02.473
- from them even today?
- (crackling)

40:02.566 --> 40:06.227
COLLINS: What is so interesting
is that monoliths are

40:06.311 --> 40:09.814
very strongly associated
with UFO sightings.

40:09.907 --> 40:13.734
Mysterious lights have been
seen at the Rudston Monolith.

40:14.820 --> 40:19.332
People witness
these strange lights and UFOs

40:19.417 --> 40:22.877
above the Carnac stones
in France.

40:24.004 --> 40:27.498
Near Stonehenge in England,
each year,

40:27.583 --> 40:30.334
strange crop circles appear.

40:30.428 --> 40:33.671
And in the very same locality,

40:33.755 --> 40:37.434
you have mysterious lights,
UFO abductions,

40:37.518 --> 40:42.272
disappearances, time slips,
things like this taking place.

40:43.432 --> 40:46.767
Plasma UFOs, have been seen
and reported.

40:46.852 --> 40:49.571
And these continue to this day.

40:51.273 --> 40:56.536
CHILDRESS: Perhaps these
standing stones are storing energy,

40:56.620 --> 40:59.947
they're emitting energy
and with the right technology

41:00.040 --> 41:02.709
and instruments,
you can pick these stones up--

41:02.793 --> 41:05.628
These standing stones--
From hundreds of miles away.

41:06.964 --> 41:10.041
TSOUKALOS: The point is that
the standing stone formations

41:10.125 --> 41:12.710
that we find
all around the world

41:12.803 --> 41:18.382
are pieces of the puzzle
of the ancient astronaut theory,

41:18.476 --> 41:23.897
that long ago we received
visits from outer space

41:23.981 --> 41:26.390
and we were visited
by none other

41:26.475 --> 41:29.652
than our first teachers
on planet Earth.

41:30.905 --> 41:35.408
NARRATOR: Do the standing
stones found across the world represent

41:35.493 --> 41:39.070
the remains of a sophisticated
global electrical grid?

41:39.163 --> 41:41.581
One that exceeds
the most advanced technology

41:41.665 --> 41:42.999
we possess today?

41:44.168 --> 41:47.662
And if so, could Earth be part
of a universal network

41:47.755 --> 41:51.082
of space ports built
for interplanetary travel?

41:51.175 --> 41:55.253
Perhaps with further examination
of the ancient monoliths

41:55.337 --> 41:58.673
we will learn to harness
their power ourselves

41:58.757 --> 42:03.186
and continue the legacy
of our alien ancestors.
