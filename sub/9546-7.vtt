00:24.819 --> 00:26.091
You shouldn't even be here at all!

00:26.395 --> 00:28.568
You should be in a hospital.
You need shock therapy.

00:28.785 --> 00:30.915
- You really do.
- You need a lobotomy.

00:31.184 --> 00:33.249
Someone to pound that stupid faÃ§ade!

00:33.370 --> 00:34.614
You want to take this outside?

00:34.762 --> 00:37.081
- I would love to.
- What? I... You know, I am in.

00:37.234 --> 00:39.114
I would love to, but I am going to be

00:39.277 --> 00:40.690
meeting Dr. Kroger, at eight o'clock!

00:40.711 --> 00:42.035
So I can't take it outside.

00:42.296 --> 00:43.260
Dr. Kroger, thank god.

00:43.452 --> 00:44.709
Haven't I-

00:45.287 --> 00:48.443
Haven't I always, had the eight
o'clock time slot on friday?

00:48.586 --> 00:51.183
Dr. K, would you tell this
lunatic, what you told me,

00:51.348 --> 00:55.523
you said, and I quote, "Harold,
we will finish this discussion"

00:55.665 --> 00:57.593
"the first thing on Friday. "

00:58.015 --> 01:01.073
He didn't mean, "the
first session on Friday,

01:01.216 --> 01:03.951
He meant, the first
thing during your regular

01:04.107 --> 01:05.182
thing during your
regular session, right?

01:05.308 --> 01:07.382
Well, look at that! Look at him!

01:07.488 --> 01:10.420
He is so ridiculous, he is so jealous.

01:10.557 --> 01:12.743
It's like look at right
into the face of crazy.

01:12.878 --> 01:13.650
Look at him!

01:13.795 --> 01:16.051
He's acting like a little twelve year old.

01:16.148 --> 01:17.013
He's acting like a 10 year old now.

01:17.128 --> 01:18.260
He's acting like a 5 year old.

01:18.416 --> 01:19.802
He's acting like a little baby year old.

01:19.968 --> 01:22.191
That doesn't even make
any sense. He doesn't...

01:22.297 --> 01:23.352
Harold!

01:25.617 --> 01:29.471
- You may have misunderstood.
- No, no, he didn't misunderstand.

01:29.687 --> 01:30.602
No, no!

01:30.737 --> 01:33.723
No, he has been trying to get
that first time slot, for years.

01:33.875 --> 01:37.213
I need to see him first,
when he's still fresh.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.352
After you, he's all worn out.

01:39.458 --> 01:41.712
After you, he's a bath you could get in.

01:41.817 --> 01:43.243
- No, that is...
- You've never seen him cry?

01:43.358 --> 01:44.480
You have never seen what he's...

01:44.646 --> 01:46.322
- Hello!
- .. laugh, we laugh.

01:47.057 --> 01:48.753
Why is this door opened?

01:49.487 --> 01:50.941
How did-

01:51.025 --> 01:52.383
How did you two get in here?

01:52.507 --> 01:54.160
- He broke in.
- No, I didn't.

01:54.495 --> 01:56.450
The door was opened.

01:56.585 --> 01:57.841
He's a liar.

01:59.108 --> 02:00.172
You are lying.

02:10.507 --> 02:11.860
Who is it?

02:13.267 --> 02:15.580
That's Theresa Mueller, she's-

02:16.088 --> 02:17.263
with the cleaning service.

02:18.047 --> 02:21.283
Now, I would call 911, but
don't use the office phone.

02:21.478 --> 02:24.160
Whatever you do, don't touch anything.

02:26.617 --> 02:28.370
I said, don't touch anything.

02:28.577 --> 02:29.573
Well, you touched it.

02:29.695 --> 02:32.291
I'm allowed to touch it,
I'm a former police officer.

02:33.748 --> 02:35.203
Right?

04:02.078 --> 04:03.693
Mr. Monk, are you sure, you're okay?

04:03.826 --> 04:05.460
Maybe we should take you home.

04:05.587 --> 04:07.082
I am home, I mean-

04:07.238 --> 04:10.723
I always consider this
room, this office, my-

04:11.355 --> 04:12.671
second home.

04:24.066 --> 04:25.932
Cap! Lieutenant!

04:27.066 --> 04:27.863
Look!

04:28.306 --> 04:29.533
Bottom of her shoes.

04:30.615 --> 04:32.980
Clean!Somebody wiped them off?

04:33.327 --> 04:34.432
Why?

04:35.055 --> 04:37.711
- That's a good question.
- Thank you.

04:39.628 --> 04:42.371
Did you check the vacuum?

04:42.518 --> 04:44.833
Yeah. Bag's empty.
Completely clean.

04:44.856 --> 04:46.320
Wait. Excuse me.

04:46.485 --> 04:50.001
This belongs right here.

04:50.367 --> 04:52.232
- How do you know?
- Because it's my chair.

04:52.356 --> 04:53.880
- What's all this?
- I'm checking for prints.

04:54.208 --> 04:55.590
Cap-uh-Cap-

04:55.708 --> 04:56.670
Leland, sir.

04:56.915 --> 04:57.633
Leland.

04:57.755 --> 04:59.951
Can we get somebody to dust this chair?

05:00.696 --> 05:01.741
I just dusted it.

05:01.946 --> 05:03.572
No, I mean... dust it.

05:03.985 --> 05:05.082
Dust dust it.

05:05.195 --> 05:06.562
- Dust the dust.
- Macy.

05:06.925 --> 05:09.450
When you're done, make sure
that the chair is clean.

05:09.616 --> 05:10.841
- Okay.
- Thank you.

05:11.236 --> 05:12.513
Monk,  why don't you wait outside?

05:13.208 --> 05:14.470
Oh, no, no. No, no.

05:14.595 --> 05:15.660
Captain, I have to do this.

05:15.796 --> 05:17.961
I have to... This is personal.

05:18.125 --> 05:20.110
That's precisely why I
want you to wait outside.

05:20.245 --> 05:21.611
No, please. I'm begging you.

05:21.766 --> 05:23.213
Look, I have to be here.

05:24.575 --> 05:25.622
Please?

05:27.558 --> 05:28.920
Lieutenant?

05:29.476 --> 05:31.382
All right. Teresa Mueller.

05:31.528 --> 05:33.823
She's been cleaning the
building for 12 years.

05:34.028 --> 05:35.810
Starts on the top floor at 7:00.

05:35.987 --> 05:37.212
Works her way down.

05:37.366 --> 05:38.800
This is alwaysher last stop.

05:38.978 --> 05:40.571
So it probably happened
about 10:00, 10:30.

05:40.696 --> 05:43.313
Somebody broke in looking for
something, probably a file.

05:43.437 --> 05:44.613
Teresa comes in.

05:44.755 --> 05:46.330
Wrong place, wrong time.

05:46.518 --> 05:49.901
But... but Dr. Kroger said
he took a quick inventory.

05:50.027 --> 05:51.352
He didn't think anything was missing.

05:51.578 --> 05:53.782
So the guy panicked,
killed her, took off.

05:53.965 --> 05:55.443
No, no, I don't- I don't think so.

05:56.188 --> 05:57.043
No...

05:57.198 --> 05:59.082
Those sofa cushions and those files.

05:59.248 --> 06:01.573
There's blood under
them but not on them.

06:01.707 --> 06:03.390
I think he killed her first,

06:03.535 --> 06:07.001
and then just took his time
and ransacked the place.

06:07.058 --> 06:08.120
But why would he do that?

06:09.048 --> 06:10.492
Maybe he wasn't well.

06:10.986 --> 06:12.601
Harold!Harold Krenshaw.

06:12.798 --> 06:14.020
You think Harold did this?

06:15.037 --> 06:16.890
No, I guess not. Damn it.

06:17.675 --> 06:19.840
Captain? They need to,
uh, release the body.

06:27.076 --> 06:28.981
I've always been kind of
curious about this place.

06:29.246 --> 06:32.700
Yep. This is where it all doesn't happen.

06:46.198 --> 06:47.180
Is that Harold's file?

06:47.335 --> 06:48.313
Are you allowed to do that?

06:48.478 --> 06:49.910
Look, I knew it.
I knew it!

06:50.265 --> 06:52.352
"Paranoia, acute narcissism.

06:52.515 --> 06:55.430
Patient believes Adrian
Monk is obsessed with him. "

06:55.565 --> 06:57.432
If anybody is obsessed with anybody,

06:57.537 --> 06:58.522
he is obsessed with me.

06:58.697 --> 07:00.091
I've been telling Dr. Kroger that for years.

07:00.255 --> 07:01.711
We talk about it all the time.

07:01.866 --> 07:03.943
Okay, but Mr. Monk, you
should not be reading this.

07:04.017 --> 07:05.950
How would you feel if
someone read your file?

07:10.028 --> 07:11.792
My  file?

07:18.525 --> 07:19.813
What are you doing?

07:20.055 --> 07:22.982
I  just had a theory about the case.

07:23.155 --> 07:24.673
I was checking a suspect.

07:28.375 --> 07:29.272
Hey, that's your file.

07:29.726 --> 07:31.491
Well, you can't rule anybody out.

07:31.698 --> 07:33.673
Mr. Monk, I do not think
this is a good idea.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.930
Come on,just a quick look.
It'll only take a second.

07:36.046 --> 07:37.712
Monk, you cannot read that.

07:37.887 --> 07:39.090
Wait, wait, wait- oh, my God, wait.

07:39.175 --> 07:40.363
Monk. That's it. That's it.

07:40.457 --> 07:41.783
You've crossed the line.
Out of here.

07:53.266 --> 07:54.690
Okay.

08:00.968 --> 08:02.331
You okay?

08:03.905 --> 08:06.441
I... saw something in my file.

08:07.197 --> 08:08.951
Oh, Mr. Monk. I told you not to look.

08:12.876 --> 08:14.231
What was it?

08:15.092 --> 08:17.029
Two words at the bottom of the page.

08:18.347 --> 08:19.243
Two words.

08:19.596 --> 08:20.913
What did it say?

08:21.856 --> 08:23.743
"No hope. "

08:28.585 --> 08:33.470
She worked for me, cleaning
my office, for... 10, 12 years.

08:33.575 --> 08:35.361
I- I didn't really know her.

08:35.828 --> 08:39.971
- I think she had a daughter.
- Yeah, one daughter in Santa Fe.

08:40.207 --> 08:41.663
No other family, though.

08:42.417 --> 08:43.760
- It's terrible.
- Yeah.

08:43.888 --> 08:46.062
Doc, you know, the door wasn't jimmied.

08:46.185 --> 08:47.172
Somebody had a key.

08:48.145 --> 08:49.600
Who elsehas a key to your office?

08:50.375 --> 08:54.081
- Just me. And Teresa.
- What about your patients?

08:55.337 --> 08:57.041
My patients?
No, of course not.

08:57.497 --> 08:59.691
Well, there was an extra set
of keys in the desk out front.

09:00.175 --> 09:01.160
Which wasn't locked.

09:01.346 --> 09:03.240
Somebody could've lifted
the mand made a copy.

09:03.638 --> 09:05.620
Wait, wait, you're saying
one of my patients...

09:06.258 --> 09:07.972
To be honest with you,Doc,
that's how it looks.

09:08.205 --> 09:10.593
We figure somebody broke
in,looking for a file.

09:10.728 --> 09:11.900
Probably his own file.

09:14.498 --> 09:16.882
Look, I realize that
you're reluctant here,

09:17.038 --> 09:18.763
but I happen to be a homicide detective,

09:18.898 --> 09:21.030
and this happens to be
a homicide investigation.

09:21.085 --> 09:22.791
I- I understand.

09:22.917 --> 09:24.921
I truly hope you do, because
if you do know something-

09:25.698 --> 09:28.322
If you believe one of your
patients could be involved in this,

09:28.417 --> 09:30.510
you are legally obligated
to help us out here.

09:32.315 --> 09:34.242
Go on, ask your lawyer.
He'll tell you.

09:40.158 --> 09:41.230
All right.

09:42.357 --> 09:43.223
There is one patient.

09:43.525 --> 09:44.583
He's delusional-

09:44.997 --> 09:46.301
borderline schizophrenic.

09:47.038 --> 09:51.262
He always thought that I was talking
to his ex-wife behind his back.

09:51.388 --> 09:54.870
He wanted to see his file
to prove that I wasn't lying.

09:55.286 --> 09:56.940
Of course I refused.

09:57.575 --> 09:59.610
He threatened me.

10:01.456 --> 10:03.880
He-he threatened to break into my office.

10:04.106 --> 10:06.300
I didn't think he meant it.

10:08.986 --> 10:11.022
What have I done?

10:12.877 --> 10:15.393
- What's his name?
- Wheeler.

10:16.868 --> 10:18.323
Joseph Wheeler.

10:21.278 --> 10:22.341
There he is! Dr. Kroger.

10:22.487 --> 10:23.520
I just called your house.

10:23.676 --> 10:24.961
Your wife said you'd be down here.

10:25.118 --> 10:26.631
Doctor, I'm sorry. I tried to stop him.

10:26.765 --> 10:27.773
He doesn't mind.

10:27.925 --> 10:29.303
Larry, I'll meet you outside.

10:29.846 --> 10:31.622
Here's the thing- at the crime scene.

10:31.778 --> 10:33.302
My file happened to fall open,

10:33.466 --> 10:35.862
and I accidentally read something,
something you had written.

10:36.038 --> 10:39.202
A notation. It's no big deal.

10:40.745 --> 10:42.510
- Adrian. Not a good time.
- No, I-I understand.

10:42.645 --> 10:44.403
I understand this has been a tough day.

10:44.496 --> 10:46.952
A woman was slaughtered in
your office, for God's sake.

10:47.097 --> 10:48.301
This can wait until Monday.

10:48.486 --> 10:51.631
Adrian, I'm not going to
be in my office on Monday.

10:51.836 --> 10:52.930
Perfectly understandable.

10:53.076 --> 10:55.240
You need some time.
I'll see you Wednesday.

10:55.325 --> 10:57.353
Adrian, you may as well
be the first one to know.

10:59.487 --> 11:01.372
I'm quitting my practice.
I'm retiring.

11:01.506 --> 11:04.653
- As of when?
- As of ten minutes ago.

11:04.777 --> 11:07.501
I have some money saved.
Maybe- maybe I'll do some writing.

11:07.655 --> 11:11.772
As you both know, I don't
have much of a sense of humor.

11:11.876 --> 11:13.810
So sometimes it's hard for me to tell-

11:13.986 --> 11:15.252
Mr. Monk, he's not joking.

11:15.446 --> 11:16.420
Adrian.

11:16.586 --> 11:19.872
I cannot continue to
practice any more after today.

11:19.965 --> 11:23.381
The police think that one of my
patients killed Teresa Mueller.

11:23.527 --> 11:25.601
I should have seen it coming. I didn't.

11:25.737 --> 11:27.231
I missed it. This is all my fault.

11:27.318 --> 11:29.822
This... this isn't happening.

11:29.946 --> 11:31.552
This can't be... happening.

11:31.686 --> 11:34.032
Adrian, I promise you I'll
get you another doctor.

11:34.217 --> 11:35.510
I'll- I'll call you next week.

11:36.348 --> 11:38.190
Okay. So it's not true.

11:38.938 --> 11:39.751
You're not retiring.

11:39.917 --> 11:41.473
I mean- You can't, because-

11:41.657 --> 11:43.311
He- he can't retire.

11:43.446 --> 11:45.800
This is step one in
the grieving process.

11:45.945 --> 11:47.722
- Denial, denial.
- He can't possibly retire.

11:48.738 --> 11:49.820
Damn you, Charles!

11:50.245 --> 11:51.863
Damn you to hell!

11:52.257 --> 11:53.202
I hate you.

11:53.335 --> 11:54.281
I hate you!

11:56.747 --> 11:59.061
You are dead to me.

11:59.155 --> 12:00.700
That's not denial.

12:00.876 --> 12:03.390
No, step two- that's anger.

12:05.145 --> 12:06.141
Okay.

12:06.715 --> 12:08.450
Okay, we're all adults here.

12:09.035 --> 12:10.322
We can work this out.

12:11.155 --> 12:12.651
I can hire you full time.

12:12.737 --> 12:14.071
I'll put you on the payroll.

12:14.205 --> 12:16.040
This  is step three.
It's bargaining.

12:16.177 --> 12:18.223
It usually doesn't go around this quickly.

12:18.356 --> 12:20.743
Why me? Why is it always me?

12:21.976 --> 12:24.162
Everybody's always leaving me.

12:24.448 --> 12:25.812
- Depression?
- This just can't go on.

12:25.997 --> 12:27.182
It's just too much. Okay.

12:27.348 --> 12:28.843
You're right.

12:29.318 --> 12:32.353
It's not the end of the world.

12:34.398 --> 12:36.740
I'm just gonna have to find another doctor.

12:37.578 --> 12:39.063
I owe you so much.

12:39.288 --> 12:42.520
Thanks to you, I think I can get past this.

12:44.336 --> 12:46.040
Thanks, Doc.

12:46.506 --> 12:47.880
And finally, acceptance.

12:48.126 --> 12:49.292
Thank God that's over.

12:49.457 --> 12:50.931
He can't retire!

12:51.248 --> 12:52.563
The man can't quit!

12:53.046 --> 12:55.153
- Because he's not a quitter!
- Wait, what's going on?

12:55.308 --> 12:56.160
I don't know, I don't know.

12:56.286 --> 12:58.710
It's like he's starting all
over again, like he's in a loop.

12:59.057 --> 13:01.152
I hate you for this, Kroger!

13:01.437 --> 13:03.531
You are dead to me, you understand me?

13:03.678 --> 13:04.652
Dead!

13:08.176 --> 13:10.082
I- I really should be heading home.

13:12.468 --> 13:14.390
Okay, okay, let's be reasonable.

13:14.568 --> 13:15.872
I'll come to your house.

13:15.997 --> 13:17.551
You'll never have to
go to your office again.

13:17.678 --> 13:18.781
That's fair.

13:24.097 --> 13:25.503
Why?

13:25.865 --> 13:26.851
Why me?

13:27.746 --> 13:29.411
Why always leaving me?

13:41.787 --> 13:42.902
This place is great.

13:43.558 --> 13:44.480
Cool.

13:44.748 --> 13:46.180
Hey, you can build your own bear here.

13:46.267 --> 13:48.541
Look, I know you have strong
feelings about this one, Monk.

13:48.687 --> 13:50.753
But if you can't handle it, tell me now.

13:50.897 --> 13:52.573
Don't go all "you" on me.

13:53.145 --> 13:54.191
Watch  it.

13:54.425 --> 13:57.061
Hey, you gonna go with the little
baseball cap or the army helmet?

13:58.098 --> 13:59.030
Patrolman's hat.

14:00.086 --> 14:01.820
Why don't you give him your badge, too?

14:01.966 --> 14:03.040
You're not using that, are you?

14:04.498 --> 14:06.010
Go find the manager's office.

14:06.216 --> 14:07.742
See if this guy wasn't
working on Thursday night.

14:07.846 --> 14:08.821
Yes, sir.

14:09.406 --> 14:10.690
Every baby bear needs a heart.

14:10.806 --> 14:12.831
So why don't you go over
there to the heart room,

14:12.975 --> 14:14.821
and get a wonderful new heart
for your wonderful new friend?

14:15.527 --> 14:16.622
Joseph Wheeler.

14:17.895 --> 14:20.023
I'm Captain Leland Stottlemeyer,Homicide.

14:20.185 --> 14:21.583
This is Adrian Monk and Natalie Teeger.

14:21.906 --> 14:23.650
Do you know Dr. Charles Kroger?

14:23.938 --> 14:25.450
Is this about the cleaning lady?

14:25.566 --> 14:27.212
She had a name. Teresa Mueller.

14:27.578 --> 14:29.363
Ranger Joe! It's not beating.

14:30.738 --> 14:32.141
You have no right to be here.

14:32.515 --> 14:33.501
This is where I work.

14:33.835 --> 14:35.463
Actually, for the moment, we work here too.

14:35.745 --> 14:37.493
- You're squeezing it.
- I know what I'm doing.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.140
Dr. Kroger said that you
wanted to see your file.

14:40.226 --> 14:41.293
Let me ask you something.

14:41.585 --> 14:43.931
If some shrink had your file,
wouldn't you want to see it?

14:44.107 --> 14:46.941
He said when he wouldn't show
it to you, you threatened him.

14:47.186 --> 14:48.490
You're hurting him!

14:48.868 --> 14:50.091
I was in the middle of a divorce.

14:50.375 --> 14:51.220
I was in a bad place.

14:51.408 --> 14:54.443
I wasn't thinking straight.
That doesn't mean I'm a killer.

14:54.798 --> 14:56.431
I think you broke its heart.

14:56.638 --> 14:57.562
Yeah, well, join the club.

14:57.846 --> 14:59.181
Okay, okay, okay.

14:59.305 --> 15:00.421
I think that he's good.

15:00.577 --> 15:02.042
I think he's okay. Look, look.

15:03.127 --> 15:04.801
You said yourself you
weren't thinking straight.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.741
You broke into Kroger's office, didn't you?

15:06.846 --> 15:07.571
No, no, not me.

15:07.716 --> 15:09.783
Yeah, you surprised Teresa,
you panicked, you grabbed

15:09.897 --> 15:11.403
a letter opener, and you stabbed her.

15:11.536 --> 15:12.493
And you know what else you did?

15:12.648 --> 15:15.392
Do you have any idea?
Dr. Kroger quit.

15:15.505 --> 15:18.140
He quit. He's giving
up his practice forever.

15:18.298 --> 15:19.681
That's what you did.

15:20.077 --> 15:21.132
You're a patient too.

15:21.557 --> 15:23.230
I heard about Dr. Kroger.

15:23.565 --> 15:24.891
You think I wanted him to quit?

15:25.195 --> 15:26.651
I would've taken a bullet for that man.

15:27.576 --> 15:30.320
I love Dr. Kroger.
He was all I had.

15:31.408 --> 15:33.160
That's how I feel too.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.050
I don't know what I'm
gonna do without him.

15:35.208 --> 15:36.742
I don't know what I'm
gonna do without him.

15:36.887 --> 15:39.611
Wheeler was doing inventory
until 1:00 AM Thursday morning.

15:40.066 --> 15:41.950
You mean he's not the guy?

15:42.655 --> 15:44.003
- What are we gonna do?
- What are we gonna do?

15:44.196 --> 15:45.800
- What are we gonna do?
- What are we gonna do?

15:46.805 --> 15:48.771
- What are we gonna do?
- I'm so bereft.

15:49.148 --> 15:52.723
I'm bereft too.
We're all bereft.

15:53.588 --> 15:55.601
Everybody's bereft.

16:00.687 --> 16:02.041
And I've been thinking about Natalie.

16:02.375 --> 16:04.163
I've become so dependent on her.

16:04.365 --> 16:05.602
Too dependent.

16:05.988 --> 16:08.840
I don't know what I'm
gonna do if she leaves.

16:09.035 --> 16:11.030
I maybe should say "when she leaves,"

16:11.196 --> 16:12.611
because it's just a matter of time.

16:13.586 --> 16:18.100
She's gonna die, or find another job.

16:18.348 --> 16:20.252
Either way, I'm screwed.

16:21.416 --> 16:23.802
Mr. Monk, I don't really
feel comfortable about this.

16:24.218 --> 16:26.893
Well, it's Monday morning, 9:00 AM.

16:27.048 --> 16:28.740
I have to talk to somebody.

16:29.466 --> 16:31.092
Okay, but you cannot talk about me.

16:31.297 --> 16:33.180
- Okay? I'm off limits.
- Fine.

16:35.437 --> 16:40.041
So, when I was 12, my mother
decided to go back to work.

16:40.345 --> 16:41.953
She said it was only part time,

16:42.105 --> 16:45.203
but she was gone almost every night...

16:45.745 --> 16:47.520
That's hard. I know.

16:47.666 --> 16:50.450
I remember when my mother
started to do volunteer work.

16:50.628 --> 16:51.550
It was so difficult-

16:53.665 --> 16:54.372
What are you doing?

16:54.745 --> 16:56.041
I'm just talking.

16:56.235 --> 16:57.401
That's not how it works.

16:57.537 --> 16:59.331
Nobody cares about your problems.

17:01.017 --> 17:05.123
So... I keep thinking
about Dr. Kroger's file.

17:05.297 --> 17:06.271
Those two words.

17:06.615 --> 17:08.060
You know? "No hope. "

17:08.377 --> 17:10.423
That could mean a lot of different things.

17:12.727 --> 17:13.762
Like what?

17:13.965 --> 17:15.411
Like, it could...

17:23.795 --> 17:25.563
I didn't see that last week.

17:26.357 --> 17:28.631
- Must've been covered up.
- What?

17:29.628 --> 17:32.230
From  here to here, it's been vacuumed.

17:33.195 --> 17:35.193
She only vacuumed part of the rug.

17:35.556 --> 17:36.720
Well, what does that mean?

17:37.065 --> 17:39.981
It means she didn't walk in on the killer.

17:41.186 --> 17:43.043
He walked in on her.

17:44.098 --> 17:45.880
He knew she was here.

17:46.027 --> 17:48.241
He must have heard the vacuum.

17:49.888 --> 17:53.123
He was after her.
This was all about her.

17:55.008 --> 17:56.600
Hi. Hello.

17:57.067 --> 17:58.841
Are you guys cops?

17:59.035 --> 18:00.171
Not technically.

18:00.367 --> 18:01.641
No, but we work with the police.

18:01.797 --> 18:03.273
This is Adrian Monk,
and I'm Natalie Teeger.

18:03.595 --> 18:04.750
Francis Merrigan.

18:04.935 --> 18:06.923
I have the office, uh, right there.

18:07.287 --> 18:08.803
- Import-export.
- Right.

18:08.977 --> 18:10.541
I- I saw the door open.

18:10.707 --> 18:11.813
I got a little worried.

18:11.925 --> 18:13.480
You know, after what happened last week,

18:13.647 --> 18:14.570
you can't be too careful.

18:14.707 --> 18:16.023
Right.

18:16.135 --> 18:17.313
Can I tell you the truth?

18:18.105 --> 18:20.252
I'm kind of glad Doc Kroger's leaving.

18:20.855 --> 18:22.151
I mean, he's a nice guy.

18:22.346 --> 18:24.070
But his patients...

18:24.918 --> 18:26.222
You know what I'm talking about.

18:27.276 --> 18:29.232
No, I don't think that I do.

18:29.796 --> 18:32.150
You know?

18:32.287 --> 18:33.591
I mean, some of 'em-

18:34.057 --> 18:36.150
I- I could see 'em from my office.

18:36.355 --> 18:38.022
It was like a freak show.

18:38.326 --> 18:40.170
Well, I'm sure that they're
doing the best that they can.

18:40.377 --> 18:43.543
They're... doing the best they can.

18:44.016 --> 18:46.002
Yeah, sure. But...

18:46.458 --> 18:47.813
One of 'em did kill Teresa, right?

18:48.255 --> 18:50.521
Actually, we're not so sure.
We were just talking about that.

18:50.747 --> 18:51.871
Well, I, uh-

18:51.995 --> 18:53.740
I'm gonna make some coffee.
I got a long night ahead of me.

18:53.857 --> 18:55.583
So I'll let you guys get back to work.

18:55.866 --> 18:57.252
Okay, well, it was nice to meet you.

18:57.368 --> 18:58.930
Yeah. Good luck.

18:59.445 --> 19:00.862
Great. Thanks.
See you soon.

19:01.045 --> 19:02.591
Have a good night.

19:13.658 --> 19:14.332
Adrian.

19:14.578 --> 19:16.122
Dr. Kroger, it's me.
Adrian Monk.

19:16.278 --> 19:18.480
How did you get here?
Where-where's Natalie?

19:18.618 --> 19:21.402
- Natalie refused to bring me.
- Good for her.

19:21.515 --> 19:23.122
I had to take a cab. It was horrible.

19:23.236 --> 19:25.062
- I'd love to talk to you-
- Adrian, no. No.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.531
I have told you, I'm retired.

19:26.837 --> 19:29.821
Here's the thing- Joseph
Wheeler did not kill Teresa.

19:29.948 --> 19:31.363
Adrian, I've been talking to the captain.

19:31.516 --> 19:32.341
I know that.

19:32.476 --> 19:34.460
It doesn't matter which of
my patients killed Teresa,

19:34.628 --> 19:36.332
it is still my responsibility.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.431
But I don't think it
was any of your patients.

19:38.596 --> 19:40.083
It was not about you at all.

19:40.238 --> 19:42.033
Adrian, of course you would say that.

19:42.178 --> 19:43.630
You-you want me to come back to work.

19:43.788 --> 19:45.792
Hey Dad! Close the damn
door! It's freezing!

19:45.906 --> 19:49.022
- Is that Troy?
- Yes, that's my son.

19:49.168 --> 19:50.212
He sounds wonderful.

19:50.518 --> 19:53.860
I hope he appreciates how lucky
he is to have you in his life.

19:54.015 --> 19:55.621
The food's getting cold.
We're not waiting for you.

19:56.838 --> 19:58.753
- Something smells good.
- Adrian. Adrian.

19:59.027 --> 20:00.303
I can't invite you in.

20:00.827 --> 20:03.211
It's just... I'm thirsty.

20:03.476 --> 20:05.081
I'm parched, really.

20:06.118 --> 20:09.713
Adrian, you can't come in.
It's really inappropriate.

20:09.855 --> 20:11.081
Isn't it?

20:12.118 --> 20:14.450
- Adrian, you've got to let go.
- It's not easy.

20:14.948 --> 20:17.630
I've been seeing you for almost nine years.

20:17.836 --> 20:20.393
No, I mean, you've got
to let go of the door.

20:20.785 --> 20:22.321
Oh. Yeah.

20:22.708 --> 20:25.030
Adrian, I promise you,
I will find you another

20:25.187 --> 20:26.592
doctor as soon as I can.

20:27.797 --> 20:30.192
That's good. That's good. Two...

20:30.525 --> 20:31.652
Two... two more fingers.

20:31.976 --> 20:34.310
Go on, good. Go, go, go.

20:35.005 --> 20:36.713
Come on, that's very good.

20:37.096 --> 20:38.651
Great.

20:40.455 --> 20:41.973
I read your notes!

20:42.687 --> 20:44.551
What did you mean by "no hope"?

20:44.955 --> 20:46.311
What does that mean?

20:46.876 --> 20:48.412
No hope.

21:27.285 --> 21:28.680
You get out of here! I'm here.

21:29.907 --> 21:32.092
You are out of your mind.
You're crazy.

21:33.977 --> 21:35.891
No, you are sick.

21:48.777 --> 21:49.540
Don't! Get away!

21:50.515 --> 21:53.143
You are pathetic!

21:54.097 --> 21:55.943
You are crazy!

22:09.756 --> 22:10.761
Dear, no, no.

22:10.877 --> 22:12.783
Don't-don't answer that.
Wait for the police to come.

22:13.167 --> 22:15.003
It's... Adrian Monk.

22:15.357 --> 22:16.921
Mrs. Kroger. Is there a problem?

22:17.095 --> 22:18.411
Somebody threw a rock.

22:18.596 --> 22:19.760
It broke a window in the bedroom.

22:20.587 --> 22:21.821
How did you get here so quickly?

22:21.957 --> 22:24.312
We just called 91130 seconds ago.

22:24.508 --> 22:25.340
Well, I...

22:25.477 --> 22:27.991
Have you been out there all
this time? It's been three hours.

22:28.125 --> 22:29.071
What have you been doing?

22:29.455 --> 22:31.820
I... was looking for my, uh...

22:31.937 --> 22:34.282
Hey Dad! Telegram for a Dr. Kroger.

22:42.267 --> 22:46.560
"Dr. K, you ruined
my life. You will pay.

22:50.136 --> 22:51.630
You were in the den when the wife ran?

22:51.835 --> 22:54.071
That's right. Is that important?

22:54.247 --> 22:55.562
It means he could see you.

22:55.985 --> 22:57.450
He could have hurt you if he wanted to.

22:57.547 --> 22:58.771
I think he was just trying to scare you.

22:59.085 --> 23:00.443
Well, he succeeded.

23:01.696 --> 23:05.083
So, you think it was
definitely one of my patients.

23:05.335 --> 23:06.553
Well, that's what we think,yeah.

23:07.275 --> 23:08.833
- And nobody saw the car?
- No.

23:09.125 --> 23:11.763
Monk, can you ID the car?
- No, sorry.

23:13.736 --> 23:15.372
I don't think he'll be back.

23:15.766 --> 23:17.211
But if it will make you feel better,

23:17.365 --> 23:18.491
I can offer you some protection.

23:18.918 --> 23:21.372
I'll do it! Be glad to do it.

23:21.576 --> 23:22.790
I'm the bodyguard.

23:23.018 --> 23:24.420
- You know, it's not necess-
- I'll move in!

23:24.825 --> 23:26.691
I'll be right here with you, 24/7.

23:26.837 --> 23:28.052
I'll never leave your side.

23:28.266 --> 23:30.612
I just have to go home,
pick up a few things, okay?

23:30.758 --> 23:32.630
Actually, I was thinking of-

23:33.338 --> 23:34.720
a couple of these guys parked out front.

23:34.815 --> 23:35.981
Great. That would be...

23:36.107 --> 23:38.053
Couple of cops out front.
That's great.

23:39.095 --> 23:40.743
Fine.

23:41.005 --> 23:42.663
It was just a suggestion.

23:42.837 --> 23:44.773
- Okay?
- Wait a second.

23:45.155 --> 23:47.943
- What?
- I've seen that rock.

23:48.168 --> 23:50.012
I know that rock.

23:51.968 --> 23:54.130
This particular rock?

23:54.295 --> 23:55.333
I know that rock.

23:55.467 --> 23:56.911
I've seen it before somewhere.

23:58.036 --> 23:59.582
If anybody else had said that,

23:59.776 --> 24:01.131
I'd have said they were crazy.

24:01.996 --> 24:03.500
Where? My dad thinks I did it.

24:04.728 --> 24:06.990
- Troy, that's not true.
- Yeah, right.

24:07.167 --> 24:10.021
Before you guys got here
he asked me if I did it.

24:10.378 --> 24:11.613
Why don't you admit it?

24:12.255 --> 24:13.571
Why are you afraid of telling the truth?

24:13.736 --> 24:15.410
What kind of shrink are
you, afraid of the truth?

24:15.617 --> 24:17.223
Troy, I'm sorry, I was upset!

24:17.615 --> 24:21.002
- Hey, Troy, remember me?
- Yeah, I remember.

24:21.317 --> 24:23.881
- You, uh, staying out of trouble?
- No.

24:24.135 --> 24:25.982
All right, why don't you
just wait upstairs, son?

24:26.135 --> 24:27.911
I told you, never to call me that!

24:28.067 --> 24:30.010
Look, officers, is there a way that a doctor

24:30.128 --> 24:32.752
could fix a DNA test?

24:32.858 --> 24:35.252
Because there is no way
Charlie and me are related.

24:35.428 --> 24:38.072
- Troy, please.
- You're not my mother, Madeline!

24:38.205 --> 24:40.553
And that man is certainly not my father!

24:40.858 --> 24:42.650
He's your father, Troy, you're
going to have to accept that!

24:42.755 --> 24:43.623
No!

24:43.775 --> 24:44.913
Hey, what do you want from me?

24:45.036 --> 24:46.821
I've taken the test three times!

24:46.987 --> 24:48.241
Whatever!

24:49.656 --> 24:50.680
We better be going, Monk.

24:50.826 --> 24:52.762
- Come on, we'll give you a ride.
- Yeah.

24:53.328 --> 24:54.652
There'll be two guys out front, Charlie.

24:54.807 --> 24:56.333
You need anything, call me.

24:56.435 --> 24:57.641
I appreciate it.

25:00.637 --> 25:04.200
Adrian, I have some
really good news for you.

25:04.347 --> 25:06.563
I called a colleague
of mine earlier tonight.

25:06.736 --> 25:08.883
Dr. Jonah Sorenson. He's a great doctor.

25:09.058 --> 25:09.920
Very famous.

25:10.726 --> 25:12.543
He usually doesn't take new patients.

25:12.698 --> 25:17.092
But he's heard about you,
so he's gonna fit you in.

25:20.275 --> 25:21.383
Maybe I'll call him.

25:21.797 --> 25:24.681
Actually, um, you have an appointment.

25:25.085 --> 25:27.531
Tomorrow. 5:00.

25:37.027 --> 25:39.800
Adrian Monk for Dr. Sorenson.

25:42.847 --> 25:44.080
Fill this out.

25:51.497 --> 25:54.110
- It says "List any phobias. "
- That's right.

25:54.527 --> 25:56.231
There are only five spaces.

25:59.425 --> 26:00.900
You can use the back.

26:04.058 --> 26:05.762
I might need another sheet.

26:12.758 --> 26:14.222
I might need another sheet.

26:21.278 --> 26:23.442
I might need another sheet.

26:26.118 --> 26:27.370
- Mr. Monk?
- That's right.

26:27.756 --> 26:28.671
Jonah Sorenson.

26:29.028 --> 26:30.650
Why don't you fill that out later.

26:30.688 --> 26:32.090
I hate all that paperwork, don't you?

26:33.108 --> 26:34.482
Yes, sir.

26:34.796 --> 26:36.780
Come on in.

26:42.228 --> 26:43.312
Are you ready?

26:47.277 --> 26:50.351
So. What do I call you?

26:53.635 --> 26:55.851
How about Adrian?

26:56.457 --> 26:57.923
Adrian. Good.

26:59.126 --> 27:01.351
Dr. Kroger sent me over your file.

27:01.825 --> 27:05.301
Seems like you've made excellent
progress in the last year and a half.

27:05.416 --> 27:07.240
No, really? Is that what it says?

27:07.577 --> 27:09.503
Well, I've only taken a glance at it.

27:09.645 --> 27:12.693
Yeah, well, keep reading.
Near the end, he's not quite so optimistic.

27:13.987 --> 27:17.311
Dr. Kroger is a good man.
I'm gonna miss him.

27:17.518 --> 27:20.092
Yes, he's a-he's a good man.

27:20.676 --> 27:24.272
- He's very symmetrical.
- Symmetrical.

27:24.688 --> 27:26.421
You mean, like, well balanced.

27:27.076 --> 27:28.540
That's a nice way of putting it.

27:31.976 --> 27:34.152
- Are-are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

27:34.627 --> 27:35.763
It's just...

27:36.247 --> 27:37.901
Just some dust.

27:38.468 --> 27:43.232
I understand that you spend a lot
of time talking about your late wife.

27:44.297 --> 27:45.580
Tell me about her.

27:46.176 --> 27:47.880
Yeah, Trudy.

27:48.156 --> 27:53.180
She was a very beautiful...

27:55.028 --> 27:56.683
Very...

27:56.817 --> 27:58.331
very symmetrical woman.

28:00.765 --> 28:02.841
- Anything else?
- No.

28:03.576 --> 28:05.510
Just beautiful and symmetrical.

28:06.465 --> 28:11.310
And you have a brother,
Ambrose, and an assistant...

28:11.655 --> 28:13.691
Natalie Teeger?
Tell me about her.

28:14.107 --> 28:16.300
In a lot of ways she reminds me of Trudy.

28:17.235 --> 28:18.991
She is also quite...

28:19.807 --> 28:21.181
Quite...

28:21.478 --> 28:23.002
- Symmetrical?
- Yeah.

28:23.428 --> 28:28.212
Adrian, I get the feeling you're not
very comfortable about my right arm.

28:28.487 --> 28:30.211
No. Oh, no, no, no, no.

28:30.427 --> 28:32.051
No. Not at all.

28:34.327 --> 28:35.283
Where is it?

28:36.888 --> 28:39.500
I lost it in a boating
accident two years ago.

28:39.807 --> 28:42.633
But I look upon it now
as a positive experience.

28:43.757 --> 28:46.233
I've learned a lot about trauma and loss.

28:46.665 --> 28:48.401
The things that you're going through.

28:50.795 --> 28:53.471
- Can you handle it?
- I'm sorry.

28:54.138 --> 28:57.083
I'm just used to the way things were.

28:57.598 --> 29:00.780
- Change is difficult.
- Change is impossible.

29:01.045 --> 29:03.150
Well, I wouldn't exactly say impossible.

29:03.308 --> 29:04.560
Look, it's not just you.

29:05.218 --> 29:06.432
It's everything.

29:06.697 --> 29:07.801
It's this office.

29:08.745 --> 29:11.992
I spent nine years in Dr. Kroger's office.

29:12.196 --> 29:13.810
I knew every book on every shelf.

29:13.968 --> 29:15.790
Every leaf on every plant.

29:16.007 --> 29:17.083
Every rock-

29:21.338 --> 29:24.473
- Are you okay?
- I have to go.

29:25.606 --> 29:26.552
Now?

29:26.727 --> 29:27.901
Yeah, yeah.

29:28.577 --> 29:30.371
Let's remember where we were
and we'll pick it up later.

29:30.595 --> 29:31.951
I mean I'll pick it up.

29:32.326 --> 29:34.040
Or you could pick it up.
We'll both pick it up.

29:34.178 --> 29:35.983
We'll each take one end.

29:36.096 --> 29:37.891
I don't wanna talk about
picking it up anymore.

29:43.375 --> 29:44.811
- Doctor?
- Oh, no.

29:44.957 --> 29:46.402
Dr. Kroger. Thank God.

29:46.555 --> 29:47.902
I figured I might find you here-listen.

29:48.085 --> 29:51.041
Adrian, you have got to respect my decision.

29:51.216 --> 29:53.621
No, no, no, no, I'm not stalking you.

29:53.825 --> 29:55.011
At least not for the moment.

29:55.167 --> 29:56.853
All right, just give me a minute.

29:56.985 --> 29:59.891
The captain said that I could
come in and pack up some things.

30:01.296 --> 30:04.791
How did your session with Dr. Sorenson go?

30:04.957 --> 30:06.492
Okay, I guess.

30:06.946 --> 30:10.821
I don't know, I just felt like
there was something missing.

30:11.098 --> 30:13.160
When was the last time you saw him?

30:13.328 --> 30:14.890
Four or five years ago.

30:15.036 --> 30:16.150
How's he doing? I heard-

30:17.735 --> 30:19.141
I heard he lost some weight.

30:19.285 --> 30:20.961
Yes, he lost a little weight.

30:22.986 --> 30:24.723
I think I have big news about the case.

30:24.946 --> 30:26.753
I remembered where I saw that rock.

30:27.145 --> 30:28.832
That rock? Rock from last night.

30:28.937 --> 30:31.753
It's been driving me crazy.
Then all of sudden, pow!

30:33.637 --> 30:35.311
It was right there.

30:36.435 --> 30:37.681
But it's amazing.

30:37.846 --> 30:39.600
You remember one particular rock?

30:39.716 --> 30:42.930
Well, I've been staring at it for
nine years. You know, gift/curse.

30:46.016 --> 30:47.981
Who else has access to this courtyard?

30:49.105 --> 30:51.902
Just me.
And Francis Merrigan.

31:02.685 --> 31:03.562
Do you see anything?

31:04.038 --> 31:06.212
I see a lot of powdered milk.

31:06.765 --> 31:08.213
Eight or nine cartons.

31:08.775 --> 31:11.323
He was carrying a carton
with him yesterday too.

31:11.908 --> 31:13.500
So?

31:14.188 --> 31:17.740
So I don't see a coffeemaker, do you?

31:19.186 --> 31:20.280
No.

31:21.515 --> 31:26.602
Powered milk is made from lactose.
Drug dealers use it to cut heroin.

31:27.335 --> 31:30.392
You think that Francis
Merrigan is dealing drugs?

31:30.826 --> 31:33.443
And I think he murdered
your cleaning lady.

31:34.736 --> 31:38.800
Adrian, I don't think you should
talk about Francis Merrigan anymore.

31:39.266 --> 31:40.262
Why not?

31:53.368 --> 31:54.692
Is he here?

31:54.958 --> 31:56.110
- Is who here?
- Mr. Monk.

31:56.435 --> 31:57.483
No.

32:00.077 --> 32:00.891
What's up?

32:13.375 --> 32:14.701
How are you doing?

32:15.175 --> 32:16.823
I'm scared to death.
What do we do?

32:17.506 --> 32:18.602
Okay.

32:19.756 --> 32:20.770
First thing.

32:22.066 --> 32:24.591
We have to move.
I'm gonna need you...

32:26.956 --> 32:28.392
to come over here.

32:50.137 --> 32:50.770
Okay.

32:51.235 --> 32:52.510
Now what?

32:53.788 --> 32:54.631
What do you mean?

32:55.607 --> 32:58.391
- What's the plan?
- I don't have a plan.

33:00.005 --> 33:02.171
Why did you have me switch places?

33:02.467 --> 33:03.441
I always sit on this side.

33:03.607 --> 33:05.731
I've been thinking a lot
about my brother lately-

33:05.877 --> 33:07.892
No, no, Adrian. This is not a session.

33:08.505 --> 33:10.843
I'm really frightened.
I don't know what's going on.

33:12.818 --> 33:13.592
Okay.

33:14.076 --> 33:15.570
Okay, do you see those figurines?

33:16.635 --> 33:17.761
Check the label.

33:18.396 --> 33:19.501
They're from Turkey.

33:19.888 --> 33:21.101
That one in the corner-

33:21.476 --> 33:22.510
it's cracked.

33:22.707 --> 33:23.850
Obviously ruined.

33:24.106 --> 33:25.550
Why didn't he throw it out?

33:25.946 --> 33:27.110
Drugs?

33:28.196 --> 33:30.272
But what does that have to do with Teresa?

33:30.705 --> 33:33.802
I think Teresa broke that figurine.

33:34.228 --> 33:37.100
I remember, after we found the body,

33:37.446 --> 33:40.910
I asked Lieutenant Disher if
he'd checked the vacuum cleaner.

33:41.097 --> 33:43.763
He said the bag was completely empty.

33:44.108 --> 33:45.050
But think about it.

33:45.216 --> 33:49.292
The bag couldn't have been empty if
she had been vacuuming rugs all night.

33:49.545 --> 33:50.660
I'm- I'm not following you.

33:50.826 --> 33:54.280
On Thursday night, Teresa was
cleaning Merrigan's office.

33:54.508 --> 33:57.282
She must have knocked over that figurine.

33:57.775 --> 33:59.142
It broke open.

33:59.438 --> 34:01.600
It was filled with powder.

34:01.825 --> 34:04.151
Heroin? She had no idea.

34:04.395 --> 34:07.421
She just vacuumed it up and
moved on to the next office-

34:07.625 --> 34:08.763
your office.

34:09.206 --> 34:11.271
Meanwhile, Merrigan comes back.

34:11.775 --> 34:13.292
He sees the broken figurine.

34:13.525 --> 34:15.433
He figured out what happened.

34:15.594 --> 34:18.143
He knewsome where in that building

34:18.315 --> 34:21.929
was a vacuum cleaner bag filled with heroin.

34:22.125 --> 34:25.831
He went looking for Teresa, and
caught up with her in your office.

34:26.268 --> 34:30.233
Merrigan must have checked the bag to
make sure the heroin was still there.

34:30.757 --> 34:33.733
Once he found it, he
couldn't just let her go.

34:34.147 --> 34:35.440
She had seen too much.

34:37.295 --> 34:41.112
Then, he rifled through your
files threw a rock at your house,

34:41.485 --> 34:44.420
so everybody would think
it was one of your patients.

34:44.676 --> 34:46.090
Everyone did.

34:47.065 --> 34:48.790
Everybody except you.

34:50.338 --> 34:51.463
Adrian.

34:51.987 --> 34:55.291
I hope someday I'm as good
at my job as you are at yours.

34:55.764 --> 34:56.860
So you're not quitting?

34:57.185 --> 34:58.773
Right now, I don't know
if it really matters.

34:58.937 --> 35:00.550
We're in big trouble here, aren't we?

35:01.066 --> 35:01.970
Yeah.

35:02.888 --> 35:04.662
I'm never going to see my family again.

35:06.207 --> 35:07.151
My son...

35:08.605 --> 35:09.620
I'm sorry.

35:10.256 --> 35:12.272
Do you think anyone will ever find us?

35:12.737 --> 35:13.841
I don't see how.

35:14.247 --> 35:17.303
Nobody in the world has
any idea where we are.

35:30.836 --> 35:32.670
Don't worry, Dr. K, I'm coming.

35:33.457 --> 35:34.760
I got your back.

35:36.295 --> 35:37.470
No sign of a struggle.

35:38.565 --> 35:39.923
Okay, well, that's a good sign, right?

35:41.625 --> 35:42.832
Somebody say "right. "?

35:44.627 --> 35:46.121
That's right, right.
That's good.

35:46.727 --> 35:47.461
Disher.

35:48.037 --> 35:49.481
Yeah, no, do it now.

35:49.915 --> 35:51.341
Captain, they're patching somebody through.

35:51.655 --> 35:52.612
He says he knows where Monk is.

35:53.417 --> 35:54.460
This is Stottlemeyer.

35:55.095 --> 35:57.321
Wait-hang on, sir.
Just slow down.

35:59.696 --> 36:00.640
Harold?

36:15.315 --> 36:16.521
All right. Okay.

36:17.526 --> 36:18.853
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

36:19.815 --> 36:20.730
Could you...

36:20.898 --> 36:22.300
Could you put meover there?

36:22.727 --> 36:25.912
- Pardon me?
- Please. I can't be on this side.

36:26.645 --> 36:28.720
Please, I'm begging you.
Just look into your hearts.

36:29.058 --> 36:31.432
He has a problem with
"situational disorder. "

36:31.618 --> 36:32.252
Okay?

36:32.507 --> 36:34.021
Believe me, he's got a lot
bigger problems than that.

36:35.747 --> 36:36.642
So what do you want to do with them?

36:37.018 --> 36:39.011
I figure we'll let Frankie decide.

36:39.406 --> 36:40.812
He's not gonna like that.

36:41.118 --> 36:42.850
Especially after what happened
with that cleaning lady.

36:43.026 --> 36:44.370
What choice did I have, huh?

36:46.595 --> 36:47.541
What is all this?

36:49.035 --> 36:50.441
Dust bunnies?

36:50.997 --> 36:53.391
Yeah, it's from the vacuum
cleaner. Just-just clean it out.

36:54.575 --> 36:55.402
Here.

36:57.008 --> 36:58.241
Pick it out.

36:58.906 --> 36:59.722
It's everywhere.

37:00.098 --> 37:01.230
Just make it look good.

37:08.918 --> 37:11.273
Careful, don't lose any.
This is pure stuff.

37:11.386 --> 37:13.123
Look, I know what I'm doing, all right?

37:18.105 --> 37:20.333
Sift through it. Just make sure
there's no more of that stuff.

37:20.578 --> 37:21.660
Be carreful.

37:22.248 --> 37:24.172
It'd be easier if we had tweezers.

37:24.557 --> 37:25.511
I left them in the car.

37:27.677 --> 37:29.461
You should have that stuff
in your arsenal, you know?

37:29.635 --> 37:30.802
This is your mess.

37:31.938 --> 37:33.173
There's some on the table.

37:34.637 --> 37:36.133
Some mess for a cleaning lady, huh?

37:38.227 --> 37:39.232
Be careful. Watch it.

38:04.517 --> 38:06.192
Police officer!
Drop that gun!

38:10.397 --> 38:11.521
- No shot!
- Me neither.

38:24.968 --> 38:27.620
No!

38:32.567 --> 38:33.562
Drop that gun!
Get down!

38:34.857 --> 38:36.213
Get down on the ground.
Show me your hands.

38:36.626 --> 38:37.512
Show me your hands!

38:37.867 --> 38:39.082
Relax Harold.
Just take it easy.

38:40.587 --> 38:42.723
You'll be okay. We're
gonna get a doctor.

38:42.906 --> 38:44.333
- We'll get a doctor.
- How's he doing?

38:44.587 --> 38:45.723
He's gonna be okay.

38:46.878 --> 38:47.772
Did you see what he did?

38:48.146 --> 38:50.500
He took a bullet for me, Adrian.

38:54.046 --> 38:56.901
Monk... Monk...

38:57.115 --> 38:58.513
Come here.

38:59.127 --> 39:00.420
Closer...

39:02.707 --> 39:03.982
Beat that.

39:16.337 --> 39:17.692
I wanna ask you something.

39:18.568 --> 39:20.702
When we were here investigating, my file

39:20.847 --> 39:23.871
happened to fall open and
a couple pages fell out.

39:24.668 --> 39:26.162
And you read your file?

39:26.437 --> 39:27.391
I couldn't help it.

39:27.778 --> 39:28.881
I happened to glance down.

39:29.596 --> 39:30.800
And I saw something.

39:31.155 --> 39:31.963
Two words.

39:33.635 --> 39:34.510
"No hope. "

39:35.628 --> 39:36.890
"No hope"?

39:37.386 --> 39:40.080
Is that what you think?

39:40.677 --> 39:43.263
Adrian, I would never say that about anyone,

39:43.405 --> 39:44.820
especially about you.

39:46.925 --> 39:49.941
Wait. I... I remember.
I remember.

39:50.086 --> 39:51.181
It wasn't "no hope. "

39:51.927 --> 39:54.570
It was "N. Hope. "

39:54.908 --> 39:56.582
An abbreviation for "New Hope. "

39:56.766 --> 39:58.491
We were talking about your father,

39:58.626 --> 40:02.402
and you said he was born
in New Hope, Pennsylvania.

40:02.868 --> 40:06.720
New Hope, Pennsylvania.

40:07.578 --> 40:08.731
Yeah. You feel better?

40:09.505 --> 40:11.021
I knew it was something.

40:11.217 --> 40:14.251
Natalie was... worried. Yeah, I'm sure.

40:17.085 --> 40:18.503
Isn't this great?

40:20.015 --> 40:20.831
Yeah.

40:21.798 --> 40:23.271
It's pretty great.

40:25.228 --> 40:26.922
I'm having troubles leeping.

40:27.938 --> 40:31.222
I think I'm developing a fear of blankets.

40:32.346 --> 40:33.922
Is there a name for that?

40:35.606 --> 40:37.161
I- I don't think so.
