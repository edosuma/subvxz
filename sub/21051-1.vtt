Five assassination attempts,

20:58.174 --> 21:01.302
Not as much as Castro,

21:01.302 --> 21:03.012

Holy cow! Well, you didn't have

23:10.306 --> 23:12.016
There was--
I'm told there was

23:12.016 --> 23:13.809
a national security council
kind of meeting?

23:27.698 --> 23:29.825
I see.
A crisis or anything?

23:31.368 --> 23:33.996
Well, I'm just asking,
'cause I'm curious,

23:33.996 --> 23:36.040
'cause we're normally scheduled
at 3:00 p. m.,

23:36.040 --> 23:39.460
and it's six hours
and forty minutes later.

23:45.633 --> 23:47.051
No, but I'm saying
there's always--

23:47.051 --> 23:47.927
there are crises
that come up?

23:47.927 --> 23:50.012
There are things
that aren't scheduled?

24:12.117 --> 24:14.328
Uh, that goes
to my bigger question,

24:14.328 --> 24:16.622
'cause my producer
who's here, Fernando,

24:16.622 --> 24:18.207
we were talking
about you earlier,

24:18.207 --> 24:20.709
and he said,
you are an excellent CEO,

24:20.709 --> 24:23.253
uh, Chief Executive Officer
of a company--

24:23.253 --> 24:24.588
Russia is your company.

24:24.588 --> 24:28.133
You kick the tires,
you deal with these problems,

24:28.133 --> 24:30.260
and you try to solve them
on the spot.

24:32.930 --> 24:36.183
Let's say the problem is this,
and you go into the detail here,

24:36.183 --> 24:39.603
and the detail
sometimes gets smaller,
and you do a micro-detail,

24:39.603 --> 24:43.440
and the micro-detail
has another micro-detail,
and before you know it,

24:43.440 --> 24:46.485
you've lost the forest
for the trees, as they say.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.113
That can be very irritating.
You could probably
go to bed at night,

24:49.113 --> 24:52.324
not having solved
some of these things,
and it really drives you nuts.

25:15.639 --> 25:17.975
He says he needs
to complete something?

25:32.489 --> 25:33.991
Which bring us to the--
a large problem,

25:33.991 --> 25:37.786
which is he's been doing this
as a president, prime minister,

25:37.786 --> 25:39.705
and now president again,
for 15 years.

25:39.705 --> 25:43.625
I'm sure he knows
the story of Ronald Reagan,

25:43.625 --> 25:46.962
one of the most admired
presidents-- by conservatives--
in my country.

25:46.962 --> 25:50.090
<i>He was famous</i>
<i>for sticking to his schedule,</i>

25:50.090 --> 25:52.593
<i>which required him,</i>
<i>on most nights, to come home,</i>

25:52.593 --> 25:55.846
<i>in the White House</i>
<i>by six o'clock,</i>

25:55.846 --> 26:00.184
<i>and have an early supper</i>
<i>and watch TV with his wife.</i>

26:07.775 --> 26:11.278
That is my point,
is that he was a smiley man.

26:11.278 --> 26:14.198
<i>He was a great greeter</i>
<i>and meeter.</i>

26:14.198 --> 26:17.409
<i>He was very happy</i>
<i>eating jelly beans</i>

26:17.409 --> 26:18.786
<i>and telling a good joke.</i>

26:18.786 --> 26:22.372
Though Reagan was a big believer
in delegating authority,

26:22.372 --> 26:26.627
<i>to everyone around him.</i>

26:26.627 --> 26:29.671
I'm just trying to make
that example because...

26:29.671 --> 26:30.839
it's another way of living.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.182
Well, it seems to me,
