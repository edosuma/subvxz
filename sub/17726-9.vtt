You ever been up to Montauk?

00:07.341 --> 00:08.642
- June 24th is my birthday.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.678
- We definitely should make
a girls' trip and come.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.480
- I don't even know
what to do about this trip.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.282
I don't know if Stassi's
gonna disinvite me.

00:14.315 --> 00:15.516
- They're just bullies, dude.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.418
- So you guys are going to
Montauk this weekend.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.019
- So I need to fix this.
- Right.

00:19.053 --> 00:20.488
- And you do and you will.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.690
- This week, Patrick
and I aren't together.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.525
- It's kind of normal
for you and Patrick.

00:24.558 --> 00:28.362
- If a dude comes up to me,
I will entertain it.

00:28.396 --> 00:30.864

is coming up.

a NASCAR race before?

00:33.801 --> 00:34.935
- No.

00:34.968 --> 00:37.238
- Do you want to go?
- But I want to go.

00:37.271 --> 00:40.141
- You're going to Sonoma?
- Yes. I'm nervous.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.575
- Kill everybody
with kindness.

00:41.609 --> 00:42.743
You have to.

00:42.776 --> 00:44.978
- Where's Lala?
- Nobody knows.

00:45.012 --> 00:48.482
- I want to make it the best
birthday ever for Ariana.

00:48.516 --> 00:51.319
And if anybody
stands in the way of that,

00:51.352 --> 00:52.586

did you get us?

Something cute.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.168
- Yeah, something cute,
like a Miata, you know.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.269
- I love Miatas.

01:41.302 --> 01:42.270
- I'm gonna go
fill out some paperwork

01:42.303 --> 01:43.537

me anything in this world.

But I was wrong.

talked about it yesterday.

- Yeah.

02:22.610 --> 02:23.877
- And didn't say
she wasn't coming.

on your friends,

"I'm sorry, Boo"

ten notches.

I was a little concerned.

kind of small, so...

Is that right?
- Close quarters.

- Close quarters.
Close counter--

looks f---ing awesome.

since I moved to California.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.164
- Yeah!

I just realized that we're the
only girls on this trip.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.634
- I know.
- A lot of poop.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.135
- Jax, I don't know how you're
gonna poop with the door open.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.437

to bring the Poo-Pourri.

bed comes out of here.

Oh, my God, these showers.

before I came.

fart like crazy.

we're moving.

- Am I gonna be carsick
this whole time?

03:59.873 --> 04:01.575
- Oh, do you get carsick?
- Yeah.

04:01.609 --> 04:03.344
- Oh, Brittany gets carsick.
- [laughs]

04:03.377 --> 04:04.478
- Tequila will help that.

04:04.512 --> 04:06.480
- You want to do
the first shot?

04:06.514 --> 04:08.582
- Is it cold yet?
I just put it in the freezer.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.117
- It is not cold.

04:10.150 --> 04:12.720
[squeaking]

04:12.753 --> 04:14.955
- Dude, Tom, you're taking out
the f---ing roof.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.458
- Know what, I thought there
would be some nicking of cars,

04:17.491 --> 04:19.660
maybe a sideswipe,
a knocked over cone.

04:19.693 --> 04:20.894
Eventually.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.563
We're not even out of
the parking lot yet.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.232
- We went two feet
and we're already in trouble.

04:25.333 --> 04:28.201
- The Sonoma Express
does not stop

04:28.235 --> 04:29.670
for cosmetic damage.

04:29.703 --> 04:32.406
Full steam ahead.

- We're in an RV, and they're
in, like, snobby--

04:34.342 --> 04:37.210
- I know!
- Dude, this is so much better.

- * You thought that I would
never make it this far *

04:40.080 --> 04:44.385
* But I rose up high
and now I am a star *

* I'm strong, work hard,
I'm a fighter *

04:48.389 --> 04:52.826
* Tearing down walls
and I'm breaking through *

04:52.860 --> 04:54.495
Otherwise, I'm gonna,
like, lose steam

04:54.528 --> 04:55.663
and not be able to do anything.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.965
I have to keep this going,
otherwise--

breakfast, I found out.

beer and jerky.

by the Wirkus Twins.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.519
Guys, this is
the worst beef jerky.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.388
It tastes like pennies.

05:20.388 --> 05:24.257
My birthdays haven't always
been the classiest events,

05:24.291 --> 05:25.693
but they're always eventful.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.728
- Ah.
Now the party's is here.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.062
- How dare you ruin
my birthday like this!

05:29.096 --> 05:30.197
- Dude, what are you
trying to prove?

05:30.230 --> 05:31.599
- You want to go,
mother----er?

05:31.632 --> 05:32.766
You want to go?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.001
- [indistinct yelling]
- Stop drinking!

05:34.034 --> 05:35.202
Don't!

05:35.235 --> 05:38.171
- Stop bitching.
- What do you want me to say?

05:38.205 --> 05:39.973
I just feel like Montauk
is the perfect place

05:40.007 --> 05:41.475
for me to get away,

05:41.509 --> 05:45.012
because aren't there, like,
bourgie blue-blooded

05:45.045 --> 05:46.414
fancy types here?

05:46.414 --> 05:48.449
Like, that's exactly
what I need right now.

05:48.482 --> 05:49.783
How did this happen?

05:49.817 --> 05:51.485
Everything is blue
and white striped

05:51.519 --> 05:54.054
like my wardrobe
that I brought here.

05:54.087 --> 05:57.157
- [gasps]
- This is gonna be so much fun.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.726
Cool.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.195
Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my God, lookit.

06:02.229 --> 06:04.465
There's a beach right there.
- Look how pretty.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.434
- It's like our own little
personal beach.

06:06.434 --> 06:09.002
- I know.
So nice.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.838
- Ooh.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.006
- Dude!
- It's so nautical.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.975
I'm really excited
to be in Montauk.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.344
It is beautiful,
the weather's gorgeous.

06:17.445 --> 06:20.448
So I'm just hoping
that everyone's attitudes

06:20.448 --> 06:22.082
can stay with the sunny weather.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.452
- Our bathroom's really cute.
- Aw.

06:24.452 --> 06:25.953
*

06:25.986 --> 06:27.187
We've been fighting so much,

06:27.220 --> 06:29.222
but I'm hoping this
can be the first step

06:29.256 --> 06:31.258
in the right direction
to repairing anything

06:31.291 --> 06:32.259
that's been broken.

06:32.292 --> 06:33.761
We'll see.

06:33.794 --> 06:36.263
- It literally is a little
private beach.

06:36.296 --> 06:37.798
Scheana, come look.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.901
*

06:40.934 --> 06:42.870
- How are you feeling
with Scheana right now?

06:42.903 --> 06:46.006
- I think we all are here with
a common purpose, obviously,

06:46.039 --> 06:47.274
to celebrate your birthday.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.076
And not that anyone's, like,
pushing anything aside

06:49.109 --> 06:50.611
or brushing anything
under the rug,

06:50.644 --> 06:52.312
but I don't--I'm not--
I'm not harboring anything,

06:52.345 --> 06:53.981
I'm not bottling up
or, you know,

06:54.014 --> 06:55.816
penting up
anything towards her.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.485
- Let this not be, like,
one of those trips

06:57.518 --> 07:00.621
where she's just, like, being
selfish and making it about her

07:00.654 --> 07:03.056
and, like, "Well, I don't want
to do, like, certain things."

07:03.090 --> 07:04.492

[lively pop music]

07:09.630 --> 07:14.668
*

07:14.702 --> 07:16.704
- A lot of planning
went into this.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.071
Like, a lot of planning.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.040
This wasn't just like
a normal trip,

07:20.073 --> 07:23.677
like, everything with the RV,
everything with NASCAR.

07:23.711 --> 07:26.647
We have super VIP tickets
that were expensive.

07:26.680 --> 07:30.417
- Yeah, and we had to get them
in the person's name

07:30.518 --> 07:31.719
that was--that's coming.

07:31.752 --> 07:32.986
- It's like, f---, dude.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.022
If she, like,
for real flake-flaked,

07:35.055 --> 07:36.890
I'm gonna be f---ing
really pissed,

07:36.924 --> 07:39.259
like I'm gonna be
f---ing livid.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.028
- I don't know if
Lala realizes this,

07:41.061 --> 07:43.764
but she's just giving
everybody an excuse

07:43.797 --> 07:44.932
to hate on her.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.700
I'm just gonna
hold off judgment

07:46.734 --> 07:48.435
until I have the real story.

07:48.536 --> 07:51.438
I just hope that whatever it is
that's going on,

07:51.539 --> 07:53.841
it better be
f---ing important.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.342
We have more room now.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.110
- For activities.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.713
- There's more room
for activities.

07:59.747 --> 08:01.214
- Jax?

08:01.248 --> 08:02.883
Are you sleeping?

08:02.916 --> 08:04.084
- I'm just getting ready.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.719
I'm checking my eyelids
for holes.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.555
- Why didn't you sit by me
on the plane, Jax?

08:07.555 --> 08:09.456
- Babe, we live together,
sleep together, eat together,

08:09.557 --> 08:10.891
play together--
I'm sure you'd be okay.

08:10.924 --> 08:11.892
45 minutes on a flight,
you'd be all right.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.327
- So annoying.

08:14.361 --> 08:17.030
I think I'm gonna Facetime
with Scheana really fast.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.098
- Everything cool
about our trip,

08:18.131 --> 08:19.567
Brittany just ruined
by calling them.

08:19.567 --> 08:20.601
- Oh, hush.

08:20.634 --> 08:21.735
- What happens in Montauk

08:21.769 --> 08:23.003
is probably not
gonna stay in Montauk,

08:23.036 --> 08:24.638
because it'll end up
on Snapchat.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.339
- Well, it already kind of has.

08:26.373 --> 08:27.808
[phone ringing]

08:27.841 --> 08:29.442
Brittany wants to
Facetime with me.

08:29.476 --> 08:31.078
- Hi!
- Hi.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.880
- Hey, y'all!

08:32.913 --> 08:34.281
- Are you guys in a boat?

08:34.314 --> 08:36.083
Oh, you're in a motor home.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.285
- Oh, that's cool.
All of you?

08:38.318 --> 08:40.287
- Um, all of us,
but Lala didn't come.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.655
- Nice.
- What happened?

08:41.689 --> 08:43.591
- She just bailed on it,
I guess.

08:43.591 --> 08:45.425
- Wait, so Lala didn't
even tell Ariana

08:45.458 --> 08:46.493
that she wasn't showing up?

08:46.594 --> 08:48.696
- Not until after
we already left, yeah.

08:48.729 --> 08:49.963
- I mean, this is f---ed up.

08:49.997 --> 08:51.464
Like, it's because of Lala

08:51.498 --> 08:53.033
that I'm not invited to Sonoma.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.234
This bitch took my spot

08:54.267 --> 08:55.803
and now she didn't even show up.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.104
- She said she couldn't handle

08:57.137 --> 08:58.939
Tom's raw sexual magnitude.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.841
"He's just too damn sexy,
I couldn't be

09:00.874 --> 09:01.909
in a motor home next to him."

09:01.942 --> 09:02.976
- It's understandable.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.344
Look at this.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.279
- I said, "I bet Scheana
would hate this."

09:06.313 --> 09:09.016
- Yeah, I'm--I'm good
in my nautical suite

09:09.049 --> 09:12.052
with a oceanfront view
and balcony.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.153
- It's actually fun, though.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.789
Like, it's like
a redneck dream right now.

09:15.823 --> 09:18.491
[laughter]

09:18.525 --> 09:19.927
All right, well,
you guys have fun.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.495
Keep me posted on everything.
- You too. We will.

09:22.529 --> 09:23.997
- All right, bye,
love you guys.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.065
- Love you, too.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.700
- So cool.
- I know.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.401
both: "It's like
a redneck's dream."

09:28.435 --> 09:29.803
[both laugh]

09:31.138 --> 09:34.374
- Talk to me more about your
perfect relationship right now.

09:40.280 --> 09:40.648
[hip-hop music]

09:43.250 --> 09:50.257
*

09:54.795 --> 09:56.529
- Hi.
- Hello.

09:56.563 --> 09:57.665
What's going on?
Are we busy?

09:57.665 --> 09:59.132
- Oh, yeah, I'm just
trying to figure out

09:59.166 --> 10:01.134
where to put this party--like,
it's 30 in the garden and--

10:01.168 --> 10:02.836
- Why don't you
give them the veranda?

10:02.870 --> 10:04.571
Have they paid
just for the garden?

10:04.604 --> 10:06.606
- They paid for the garden.
- It's a nice evening.

10:06.640 --> 10:10.043
Open the front doors so we can
use the terrace as well.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.345
Push everybody back.
- All right, sounds good.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.647
That's cool. All right.
[phone rings]

10:13.681 --> 10:14.782
- Hello?

10:14.815 --> 10:16.116
- Hi, Lisa.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.951
- Sorry, darling, how are you?

10:17.985 --> 10:19.653
- It's so good up here.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.088
We're having the best time.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.389
- Okay, good.

10:22.422 --> 10:23.957
- I wanted to ask you

10:23.991 --> 10:27.995
have you seen or--
or heard from Lala at all?

10:28.028 --> 10:29.730
- No, no, no,
she took time off.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.732
I thought she was with you.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.200
- She was supposed to
be with us

10:33.233 --> 10:35.602
and then she didn't show up
to the airport this morning.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.672
She sent me a text apologizing
and saying

10:38.706 --> 10:41.541
that she was sorry she had to
miss a trip last-minute,

10:41.574 --> 10:43.410
but when I asked her
what happened,

10:43.443 --> 10:45.545
she hasn't responded to me.

10:45.578 --> 10:47.114
- I mean,
it's kind of irritating for me,

10:47.147 --> 10:48.448
because she begged
for the night off.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.817
It's a busy Saturday night.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.618
I'd like to trust Lala.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.620
But she started our relationship

10:53.653 --> 10:56.724
with a little bit of a...lie.

10:56.757 --> 10:59.526
How was the modeling?
- It's a long story.

10:59.559 --> 11:03.130
- You didn't really have a
modeling job, though, did you?

11:03.163 --> 11:05.232
So I'm a little hesitant

11:05.265 --> 11:07.434
to believe
a lot of what she says.

11:07.467 --> 11:10.037
It's your birthday;
just forget about it.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.739
All right?
Just have a good time, be safe.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.340
- All right.
- Speak to you later.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.075
- All right,
have a good weekend.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.844
- All right, darling, okay.
Bye-bye.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.312
- It's pretty clear that
if Lala's not with me,

11:19.346 --> 11:20.814
and she's not at work,

11:20.848 --> 11:22.249
she's basically
just proving to me

11:22.282 --> 11:26.219
that she's shady as f---
and I'm over it.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.789
- All right, are we passing
around some tequila, or what?

11:28.822 --> 11:29.890
- Yeah.
- Whoo!

11:29.923 --> 11:31.892
[all cheering, howling]

11:31.925 --> 11:35.763
*

11:35.796 --> 11:38.265
- It's so pretty.
- Private beach!

11:38.298 --> 11:39.900
- The thing is,
New Yorkers are, like,

11:39.933 --> 11:41.334
go, go, go, all the time

11:41.368 --> 11:44.104
and they go to Montauk
to, like, decompress

11:44.137 --> 11:46.039
and do nothing.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.776
I do nothing all the time,

11:48.776 --> 11:50.844
so I don't really
get the appeal.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.145
- Can we make drinks
real fast?

11:52.179 --> 11:53.580
- Okay, who wants what?

11:53.613 --> 11:55.548
- Scheana, what do you want?
- I'm okay.

11:55.582 --> 11:58.318
- It's my birthday,
and I want everybody to drink.

11:58.351 --> 12:01.789
- Well, if wouldn't have
taken my straw earlier...

12:01.789 --> 12:04.825
I can't--the ice--my teeth
are way too sensitive.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.459
- All right, all right, yes,

12:06.493 --> 12:08.028
this is typical Scheana.

12:08.061 --> 12:11.131
Maybe the drink isn't at the
right temperature for her,

12:11.164 --> 12:12.800
or we don't have
the right straw.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.968
Like, seriously, just, like,
have a f---ing drink.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.203
Okay?
[giggles]

12:16.236 --> 12:18.005
- Brittany Facetimed us.

12:18.038 --> 12:22.509
All of them are staying
in an RV together.

12:22.542 --> 12:25.145
- What?
- They're all in an RV.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.680
Brittany said,
"it's a redneck's dream."

12:27.714 --> 12:29.817
- Redneck's dream
and my worst nightmare.

12:29.817 --> 12:30.918
- All of them?

12:30.951 --> 12:33.653
So Tom and Ariana,
Jax, Brittany,

12:33.686 --> 12:36.056
Jeremy, Tom, and Lala?

12:36.089 --> 12:38.158
- Lala didn't come.
- Wait, really?

12:38.191 --> 12:40.060
- Weird as f---.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.095
- I guess she texted Ariana

12:42.129 --> 12:44.965
and just apologized,
but didn't give any reasoning.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.566
- It's actually probably better
that she's not there.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.201
- Well, it makes you feel better
for Brittany.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.737
- Oh, no, totally,
Brittany was like, beaming.

12:50.838 --> 12:52.605
Like, she was so happy.
[laughs]

12:52.639 --> 12:54.441
- If Lala's not there,
then it's like,

12:54.474 --> 12:58.545
okay, the hassle that she
would cause the Schwartz

12:58.578 --> 13:00.247
while she's, like,
trying to skank on him.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.314
- I know.

13:01.348 --> 13:02.649
Remember, this is a girl

13:02.682 --> 13:04.551
that doesn't wear underwear
to work.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.219
- Does anybody
want to try this on?

13:06.253 --> 13:07.720
- I don't have underwear on.

13:07.754 --> 13:09.857
- You've got a short dress on
and no underwear?

13:09.890 --> 13:10.958
- You're welcome.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.692
- The girl that can't
keep her top on

13:12.725 --> 13:13.894
for more than three minutes.

13:13.927 --> 13:17.998
[indistinct chatter]

13:18.031 --> 13:20.067
I feel like I should send Lala
a thank you card,

13:20.100 --> 13:22.502
because even 3,500 miles away
on that trip,

13:22.535 --> 13:25.238
she was still gonna bug me,
so thank you, Lala.

13:25.272 --> 13:26.473
- God, we're such haters.

13:26.506 --> 13:27.975
- [laughs]

13:28.008 --> 13:30.978
[rock music]

13:31.011 --> 13:33.113
*

13:33.146 --> 13:35.315
- Oh, we're passing
the Sonoma County line.

13:35.348 --> 13:36.649
- Aw, sh--.
- Whoo!

13:36.683 --> 13:39.352
- Here we are, it's official.
- Cheers, Sonoma.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.788
- Whoo!
- Yes.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.957
- Hey, guys, if you're changing
when you get there,

13:43.991 --> 13:46.793
start visualizing our outfits
now, 'cause we're gonna go.

13:46.894 --> 13:47.995
- I don't visualize outfits.
I just put 'em on.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.596
- Well, if that's what you do,

13:49.629 --> 13:50.964
then that's what you do.

13:50.998 --> 13:53.000
Here we are, guys.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.734
- Oh, it's so pretty.

13:54.767 --> 13:55.936
*

13:55.969 --> 13:58.505
- Jax, honey,
get your stuff and come out here

13:58.538 --> 13:59.907
so we can change in there.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.009
- Hey, Jax,
show me some titty.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.743
- What're you putting stuff on
in there for?

14:03.776 --> 14:05.645
- I'm just putting deodorant on,
honey, I got ya.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.248
- Jax had
a breast reduction surgery.

14:08.281 --> 14:09.917
- Dude, look at that shirt.
It's nice.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.718
It's got the bra built in it.

14:11.751 --> 14:13.753
You can be in style
and be supported

14:13.786 --> 14:15.255
at the same time, you know?

14:15.288 --> 14:17.324
- You're one of the rare couples
that have

14:17.357 --> 14:20.627
both had breast augmentation--
male/female couples.

14:20.660 --> 14:23.263
- Yeah.
- That's a rare combo, dude.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.332
- Right now, he's got
the compression bra on,

14:25.365 --> 14:26.533
the man bra,

14:26.566 --> 14:28.101
and he hasn't showered in,
like, a week,

14:28.135 --> 14:31.071
and he smells really,
really bad.

14:31.104 --> 14:34.574
- Aw, Jax, I had a bra
just like that when I was ten.

14:34.607 --> 14:35.943
[laughter]

14:35.943 --> 14:37.644
- Just to give you an idea,
he smells like

14:37.677 --> 14:39.947
he's worn the same
jockstrap for a year

14:39.947 --> 14:43.116
and ran every day that year
and not washed it once.

14:43.150 --> 14:44.952
- I took my vest off,
it feels so good.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.719
- Oh, let me see the boobs.

14:46.753 --> 14:48.388
Damn, big debut.
- They're swollen.

14:48.421 --> 14:51.358
- Ugh.
Dude.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.193
- Thanks for dressing up, dude.
- Don't do that!

14:53.226 --> 14:55.162
- Oh, sh--, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.297
*

14:57.330 --> 14:58.999
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, how's it going? I'm Tom.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.968
- I'm Tom too, as well.
- Nice, man.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.569
- Welcome to Cline Cellars.
- Hi, Ariana.

15:02.602 --> 15:03.703
- And it's your birthday
as well, I believe.

15:03.736 --> 15:04.704
Isn't it?
- It is my birthday.

15:04.737 --> 15:05.973
- Happy Birthday,
congratulations.

15:05.973 --> 15:07.574
- Thank you.
- I'm the assistant wine maker.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.776
Um, help making the wine here
with the wine maker, as well.

15:09.809 --> 15:11.344
And, uh, we'll learn about
some grapes,

15:11.378 --> 15:13.146
taste some wine out here
in the gallery, so...

15:13.180 --> 15:14.647
- Awesome.
- Cool, love that.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.984
- I've been to wineries before

15:17.017 --> 15:20.453
and it's a kind of
high-class thing,

15:20.487 --> 15:23.023
but we're pulling up
to this place

15:23.056 --> 15:25.658
in a freaking Winnebago.

15:25.692 --> 15:28.628
I mean, could we be
more of a sore thumb?

15:28.661 --> 15:30.830
- Okay, so we got six wines
for you guys.

15:30.863 --> 15:32.299
First up, we got
the cashmere white.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.767
A blended white wine.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.069
- You're good?

15:36.103 --> 15:37.437
- I'm just not a huge
wine drinker.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.039
I can drink it,
I'm just not a big fan of it.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.907
Being sober at a winery,

15:41.008 --> 15:43.710
you take whole new look at
things, I'll tell ya that.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.745
If we were going to, like,
a vodka vineyard,

15:45.778 --> 15:47.314
that would be awesome.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.049
But it's okay,
I don't mind.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.018
- Yeah, it's got a really nice,
vibrant flavor to it.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.552
It's got, um,
creaminess to it.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.121
Got a little nuttiness in there,
as well.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.023
- It has a nice semen finish,
do you notice that?

15:56.023 --> 15:57.390
- Yeah, it does.
- Dude!

15:57.424 --> 15:58.825
- I'm sorry.
- Salinity.

15:58.858 --> 16:00.827
- I was gonna say, how do you
know what semen tastes like?

16:00.860 --> 16:02.395
- That was kidding.
I don't, I'm just--

16:02.429 --> 16:03.630
- [laughs]

16:03.663 --> 16:05.932
This is my favorite one so far.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.734
I never have been
a wine drinker.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.036
If it was shots of tequila,

different types of whiskies
or bourbon,

16:11.204 --> 16:13.773
I'm your girl,
but when it comes to wine,

16:13.806 --> 16:15.908
I have no idea
what I'm talking about.

16:15.942 --> 16:17.544
- So this one is the
Cline chardonnay.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.279
100% chardonnay
from estate fruit.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.448

16:35.062 --> 16:36.363
I know what that is.

having you guys,

16:37.564 --> 16:38.931
and it's been so much fun
showing you around.

16:38.965 --> 16:41.168
- Thank you so much, Tom,
this has been so wonderful.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.402
- All right, guys,
I got an idea.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.237
We should do high card cut,

of spittle bucket.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.244

game here.

16:51.278 --> 16:52.379
It may not seem like much,

16:52.412 --> 16:54.181
but there was people at that
table before us,

16:54.214 --> 16:55.215
spitting in the bucket.

16:55.248 --> 16:56.583
- All right, aces are low.

16:56.616 --> 16:57.784
- Queen, yes.
- Damn.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.086
- Ah, shoot.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.321
- And then, we topped it off
with more wine spit.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.156
- Good.
- Eight.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.658
- I feel like being third
is putting me in, like,

17:05.692 --> 17:07.727
a bad position
to get a low card.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.529
- And whoever gets
the lowest card

17:09.562 --> 17:10.963
has to drink that spit bucket.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.532
- A two!
- I told you!

17:12.565 --> 17:14.501
- Oh, sh--.
- I told you!

17:14.534 --> 17:17.337
Being third was putting me
in a bad position.

17:18.738 --> 17:19.806
- I got an eight.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.874
- Who knows what kind of
weird bacteria

17:21.908 --> 17:23.176

17:23.210 --> 17:24.744
I don't know if bacteria
can ferment,

17:24.777 --> 17:26.446
but it's not gonna be good.

- Just do it.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.761
- Think about that as it's
going down your throat.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.296
- It's definitely
people's backwash.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.665
- I'm embarrassed, I don't want
anyone to see me doing this.

17:45.698 --> 17:47.167

17:51.238 --> 17:52.639
We'll blame it on
the flower pot.

17:52.672 --> 17:55.808
- There it is.
Nice.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.410

- I mean, it is a deal breaker
for some people.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.349

are gonna cause fights.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.487

a perfect relationship

good luck if it lands on you.

say--if you got pooped on

it's good luck.

did you say

18:51.664 --> 18:52.999
"I'm in a perfect relationship"?

18:53.032 --> 18:54.601
- No one's in the perfect
relationship.

it's like 90% perfect.

18:57.237 --> 19:00.373

perfect relationship right now.

having sex with my boyfriend.

where I'm coming from,

23:22.902 --> 23:24.170
he understands where
I could potentially

23:24.203 --> 23:25.738
take myself in my life.

23:25.772 --> 23:27.039
And he's always believed in me.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.341
Hey, I was gonna ask you,

23:29.375 --> 23:31.177
you guys need a DJ
at Redbury?

23:31.210 --> 23:33.012
He also has got
a really sick bar

23:33.045 --> 23:34.146
on Hollywood and Vine

23:34.180 --> 23:36.082
that I would f---ing love
to DJ at.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.985
- The minute you said that
you got fired from Pump,

23:39.018 --> 23:42.021
fired from Sur,
I knew this would come up.

23:42.054 --> 23:44.156
Look, I think if you're
gonna DJ for us,

23:44.190 --> 23:45.224
you're not drinking.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.325
- 100%.

23:46.358 --> 23:47.827
- And the minute
you break your word,

23:47.860 --> 23:49.596
there's got to be
consequences.

23:49.629 --> 23:51.197
Like, I got to cut
your hair or something.

23:51.230 --> 23:53.733
- Or fire me.
- Fire you and cut your hair.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.301
- Will you shake my hand?
- What?

23:55.334 --> 23:57.236
- This isn't a deal shake,
I just want to thank you.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.105
- [laughs]
- For having my back.

23:59.138 --> 24:00.540
I guess for the time being,

24:00.573 --> 24:02.775
it's gonna be sober DJ
James Kennedy behind the decks.

24:02.809 --> 24:04.376
You know,
I can't let Lisa down,

24:04.410 --> 24:05.778
I can't let myself down,

24:05.812 --> 24:07.847
and I don't want to let Arthur
down either, you know?

24:07.880 --> 24:10.783
This is the first day
of the rest of my life.

24:10.817 --> 24:12.519
- You know what, let's get
weird, let's have fun.

24:12.519 --> 24:14.887
- Yes.
- Without the alcohol.

24:14.921 --> 24:16.689
- Without alcohol, promise.
- [laughs]

24:16.723 --> 24:17.824
- Promise.

24:17.857 --> 24:18.925
Thank you so much, dude.

24:18.958 --> 24:22.995
*

24:23.029 --> 24:24.564
- I feel like other people
are judging us

24:24.597 --> 24:26.198
'cause of our mini grill.

24:26.232 --> 24:28.668
- Dude, it's not the size,
it's how you use it, man.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.169
- Yeah, you're right.
You're right.

24:30.202 --> 24:32.138
You guys want to sit down,
talk about life?

24:32.171 --> 24:34.140
- I'm not gonna lie to you right
now, I'm f---ed up, so

24:34.173 --> 24:36.142
if you want to get the feelings
in, let's get it in right now.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.144
- Where's the girls?
Where's Brittany and Ariana?

24:38.177 --> 24:39.145
- Birthday shot.

24:39.178 --> 24:41.013
- Oh, f---, Brittany.

24:41.047 --> 24:42.749
- You knew
when you invited me here

24:42.782 --> 24:44.584
this was gonna happen.

24:44.617 --> 24:45.885
[laughs]

24:45.918 --> 24:47.386
- F---.
- Are you having fun?

24:47.419 --> 24:49.388
- Oh, my God,
I'm having the best time.

24:49.421 --> 24:51.824
I'm so glad you came.
- Oh, me too.

24:51.858 --> 24:53.626
- Are you having fun too?
- Yeah.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.127
- Cool.
I'm glad.

24:55.161 --> 24:58.097
I'm so excited
to be here in Sonoma

24:58.130 --> 25:00.700
having the f---ing
time of our lives.

25:00.733 --> 25:04.203
No joke,
this bottle was us.

25:04.236 --> 25:06.839
I don't think anyone else
drank out of this bottle.

25:06.873 --> 25:09.976
Because I didn't want to
go out to a nice dinner

25:10.009 --> 25:13.580
or go out to a club and having
to be dressed up the whole time

25:13.613 --> 25:15.782
and just feeling, like,
that restriction.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.016
Like, f--- that.

25:17.049 --> 25:18.818
*

25:18.851 --> 25:21.253
- Dude, me and Ariana,
like, lately,

25:21.287 --> 25:22.955
like in the past few months--

25:22.989 --> 25:24.957
which, Jeremy, I know it's
a little awkward,

25:24.991 --> 25:26.058
I know it's your sister.

25:26.092 --> 25:28.861
- Go ahead, I'm--
I'm well aware.

25:28.895 --> 25:31.030
- I've been, like, trying to
have sex with Ariana,

25:31.063 --> 25:32.364
and she's, like,
not been into it.

25:32.398 --> 25:33.766
- Right.

25:33.800 --> 25:36.636
- You start to feel like a
f---ing, like--like a skeeze.

25:36.669 --> 25:38.605
You start to feel sleazy.

25:38.638 --> 25:41.808
- Tom and I were arguing about
not having sex

25:41.841 --> 25:43.409
because I'm the one
that's like,

25:43.442 --> 25:45.344
"Get the f--- off of me."
- [laughs]

25:45.377 --> 25:48.214
- Stop trying to go down on me
all the time.

25:48.247 --> 25:50.316
- What?
I would never be like,

25:50.349 --> 25:52.118
"Stop trying to
go down on me all the time."

25:52.151 --> 25:54.887
- Well, I'm like, "I literally
just got home from the gym,

25:54.921 --> 25:56.022
can you not, though?"

25:56.055 --> 25:57.624
- [laughs]

25:57.624 --> 25:59.992
- I was like, "I'm not
jerking off as an option,

26:00.026 --> 26:03.996
I'm jerking off because it's
like the only thing I have."

26:04.030 --> 26:05.464
Like, it's all I have.

26:05.497 --> 26:07.867
"I can't even have sex with you,
I have to go jerk off,"

26:07.900 --> 26:09.736
like, that's the only way
I can get off.

26:09.769 --> 26:10.970
And, like,
you have to understand,

26:11.003 --> 26:12.872
like, I've been working out
lately a lot.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.074
I need to have sex.
I want to have sex.

26:15.107 --> 26:18.310
- If Brittany came to me
and said the whole sex part

26:18.344 --> 26:20.847
of our relationship is over,

26:20.880 --> 26:23.650
I'd be hitting the door,
then going for a run.

26:23.650 --> 26:24.651
A long run.

26:24.684 --> 26:25.685
[laughs]

26:25.718 --> 26:27.153
- Sometimes you have
little arguments,

26:27.186 --> 26:29.421
it'll turn it off
like that.

26:29.455 --> 26:30.657
- What do you
and Brittany fight about?

26:30.657 --> 26:32.258
I have no f---ing clue.
- It's me.

26:32.291 --> 26:33.359
It's 100% me.

26:33.392 --> 26:34.727
- You get pissed off and you
start throwing

26:34.761 --> 26:35.828
everything you've done for her.

26:35.862 --> 26:37.329
- You know what,
I should sabotage it.

26:37.363 --> 26:39.031
Because everything's finally
going right,

26:39.065 --> 26:40.933
and I'm like, "You know what,
I got to f--- this up somehow."

26:40.967 --> 26:42.669
- That's--
- So I'm gonna sabotage it.

26:42.669 --> 26:45.371
She is the perfect
girlfriend for me.

26:45.404 --> 26:48.240
The all--there's no--it's never
gonna get better than that.

26:48.274 --> 26:49.441
That's it,
that's the almighty.

26:49.475 --> 26:51.143
This is how life should be.

26:51.177 --> 26:53.079
But, oh, what do I do?
I got to f--- this up somehow.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.280
Because that's what Jax does.

26:54.313 --> 27:01.320
*

27:02.454 --> 27:03.690
- That was a good one.

27:03.723 --> 27:06.292
Jax would prefer me to, like,
run around the block

27:06.325 --> 27:09.929
in Converse with no socks on
so he could lick my toes.

27:09.962 --> 27:12.231
- Oh, yeah, well,
I know about that.

27:12.264 --> 27:16.535
[indistinct chatter]

27:16.568 --> 27:17.837
- I'm like, "Yeah!"

27:17.870 --> 27:19.205
[laughs]

27:19.238 --> 27:20.973
- I'm like, "No!

27:21.007 --> 27:22.709
Go away!"

27:22.709 --> 27:24.744
You know, girls don't always
want to sit around

27:24.777 --> 27:28.114
and talk about tampons
and makeup

27:28.147 --> 27:30.016
and "Bridget Jones's Diary."

27:30.049 --> 27:33.485
Sometimes girl really do sit
down and talk about

27:33.519 --> 27:36.155
the bone zone
and going to Boner Town--

27:36.188 --> 27:37.489
Erection City.

27:37.523 --> 27:39.759
That's why we're
wasted at NASCAR

27:39.792 --> 27:41.961
and not having
a f---ing tea party.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.562
Oh, my God,
I'm swimming.

27:43.595 --> 27:45.631
I'm in a fish bowl.
- [laughs]

27:45.732 --> 27:46.833
- Let me out of here.

27:48.467 --> 27:49.902
- Well, we're doing
green tea shots.

27:49.936 --> 27:52.171
- I'll do whatever you want.
- I'll throw up.

27:52.204 --> 27:54.373
That's, like, bad
college memories for me.

27:54.406 --> 27:55.975
- Oh, they're all
bad memories for me,

28:01.113 --> 28:01.480
[techno music]

28:04.150 --> 28:09.889
* *

28:09.922 --> 28:11.423
- Can we sit at the bar?
- Yeah.

28:11.457 --> 28:12.591
- Okay.

28:12.624 --> 28:15.527
*

28:15.561 --> 28:17.196
- I'm having a dilemma
on what to drink.

28:17.229 --> 28:19.431
I, like, really--like,
I want a beer, but, I...

28:19.465 --> 28:20.800
I'm doing beer.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.034
I'd rather just be
a little fatter tomorrow.

28:22.068 --> 28:23.135
- If you just stick to beer,

28:23.169 --> 28:24.570
then you're not gonna be
hung-over.

28:24.603 --> 28:27.273
- I can do beer and some shots.
- I can do beer and shots too.

28:27.306 --> 28:28.775
I can't do liquor and shots.
Done.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.209
- Well, we're doing
green tea shots.

28:30.242 --> 28:32.912
- One of those,
I will be hung-over.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.180
- Really?

28:34.213 --> 28:36.015
- I'll do whatever you want.
- I'll throw up.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.284
- Uh, listen,
Debbie f---ing Downer,

28:38.317 --> 28:41.053
there's, like, a cool way
to decline a shot.

28:41.087 --> 28:42.454
The one way to not do it,

28:42.488 --> 28:44.323
is to remind me
that I'll be hung-over.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.525
- That's, like,
bad college memories for me.

28:46.558 --> 28:49.361
That,
Washington apple shots...

28:49.395 --> 28:51.030
- Oh, they're all
bad memories for me,

28:51.063 --> 28:53.365
but I just keep on going,
you know?

28:53.399 --> 28:54.666
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

28:54.700 --> 28:56.435
- Can I get a chaser?

28:56.468 --> 28:58.905
- It's like--
- It's so good.

28:58.938 --> 29:01.373
- I would drink those
until I f---ing passed out.

29:01.407 --> 29:04.410
- Right?
- [laughs]

29:04.443 --> 29:06.612
- Scheana--
- I took a sip, I tried it.

29:06.645 --> 29:09.715
*

29:09.816 --> 29:10.716
- Share it.

29:10.817 --> 29:12.852
We share a brain.

29:12.885 --> 29:14.353
- These girls
may share a brain,

29:14.386 --> 29:16.823
but what they don't share
is my workout regimen,

29:16.823 --> 29:18.825
so y'all can drink
the sugary sh--

29:18.825 --> 29:20.159
and I'll be just fine.

29:20.192 --> 29:23.129
- It's her birthday.
- Are you kidding me?

29:23.162 --> 29:24.897
- It is, it's her birthday.

29:24.931 --> 29:26.498
both: 22.

29:26.532 --> 29:27.834
- Oh!
- How did you know?

29:27.834 --> 29:29.235
- That's my lucky number.

29:29.268 --> 29:30.569
- You know what
my lucky number is?

29:30.602 --> 29:32.839
Four.
Two and two is four.

29:32.839 --> 29:35.307
So 22--I go real deep.
I go real...

29:35.341 --> 29:37.076
[laughter]

29:37.109 --> 29:38.510
I go granular with this.

29:38.544 --> 29:41.647
- I was hoping for, like,
some younger hot dudes.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.449
- All right, so we're gonna
do a shot, all right?

29:43.482 --> 29:46.853
*

29:46.853 --> 29:48.120
- Like, gray pubes?

29:48.154 --> 29:50.522
No, I--I can't.
No.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.191
- You gonna come over there
later, or what?

29:52.224 --> 29:55.127
- Maybe we can later.
- All right, we'll see ya later.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.496
- Thank you.
- Thank you, that's very sweet.

29:57.529 --> 29:59.465
- I think we
found you a suitor.

29:59.498 --> 30:01.233
- [laughs]

30:01.267 --> 30:02.534
[bell dings]

30:02.568 --> 30:05.137
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

30:05.171 --> 30:07.840
*

30:07.874 --> 30:09.741
- What's the oldest
you would date?

30:09.775 --> 30:11.110
- 45.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.544
- Okay, but there's a lot of
things to consider,

30:12.578 --> 30:13.880
because if you get serious
about someone,

30:13.913 --> 30:15.347
you think about, like,
kids and stuff like that.

30:15.381 --> 30:17.984
I mean, what if he's
already had a vasectomy?

30:18.017 --> 30:20.452
- Get that sh-- reversed
or f--- off.

30:20.486 --> 30:22.288
[laughs]

30:22.321 --> 30:26.058
*

30:26.092 --> 30:28.827
- Happy birthday, Ariana!
- Whoo!

30:28.861 --> 30:30.662
- Happy birthday!
- It's my birthday!

30:30.696 --> 30:32.098
- We're so NASCAR right now.

30:32.131 --> 30:34.200
- Normally, I don't get to see
Ariana this drunk.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.068
- I got a hot dog,
I got tequila.

30:36.102 --> 30:37.236
- Dude!

30:37.269 --> 30:38.670
- I don't know,
I think it's great.

30:38.704 --> 30:39.705
I love it.

30:39.738 --> 30:42.241
- Mmm, f--- yeah.
- Ew, dude.

30:42.274 --> 30:43.709
- Yes, I love it!

30:43.742 --> 30:45.044
This is what
we came here for, man.

30:45.077 --> 30:46.178
We're not being bourgie.

30:46.212 --> 30:47.579
- Give me a
f---ing bite of that.

30:47.613 --> 30:49.281
Has it been in your butt?
Who's butt has it been in?

30:49.315 --> 30:50.416
- No, it hasn't been
in anybody's butt.

30:50.449 --> 30:52.484
You got to put hot sauce on it.
- [indistinct].

30:52.518 --> 30:54.286
- Like, Ariana doesn't
get drunk all the time

30:54.320 --> 30:56.388
like us--she's responsible.

30:56.422 --> 30:57.890
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

30:57.924 --> 30:59.291
- But when she does get drunk,

30:59.325 --> 31:01.928
she's eating a piece of
half-cooked steak

31:01.928 --> 31:04.163
with her hands,
chugging tequila.

31:04.196 --> 31:07.066
You should be like that
more often, Ariana.

31:07.099 --> 31:09.335
- On the grill.
Hey!

31:09.368 --> 31:12.104
- She's burning her ass cheeks.
- Oh, wow.

31:12.138 --> 31:13.940
That ass is hot.

31:13.973 --> 31:17.776
*

31:17.809 --> 31:19.545
- How are you?
Sorry. Sorry to interrupt.

31:19.578 --> 31:21.147
How are you?
Good to see you?

31:21.180 --> 31:22.781
My name is Matt,
nice to see you.

31:22.814 --> 31:23.815
- Hi, Matt.

31:23.849 --> 31:25.985
- Love it, love it,
love all of ya.

31:26.018 --> 31:28.020
- Thank you.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.088
- Anyways...

31:29.121 --> 31:30.256
[chuckling]

31:30.289 --> 31:31.523
- Oh, that's it.
Oh, okay.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.859
- That's it?
You had nowhere else to go?

31:33.960 --> 31:35.527
- I know.

31:35.561 --> 31:38.397
- He's tall, he's not
as old as my grandfather.

31:38.430 --> 31:39.831
We're getting a little warmer.

31:39.865 --> 31:41.733
- What'd I interrupt?

31:41.767 --> 31:43.035
- It's her birthday.

31:43.069 --> 31:44.270
- Oh, really?
Happy birthday.

31:44.303 --> 31:46.605
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah, she's 22.

31:46.638 --> 31:47.706
- Really?
- I'm not.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.075
- Just--she keeps forgetting,

31:49.108 --> 31:50.509
so we wrote it down
so she remembers.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.178
- [chuckles]

31:52.211 --> 31:53.445
That's so you know.

31:53.479 --> 31:56.315
- Then he starts talking
and we get a little cooler.

31:56.348 --> 31:58.084
- Welcome to Montauk and, uh,

31:58.117 --> 31:59.418
hopefully, you get out alive.

31:59.451 --> 32:02.654
- Thank you.
- Oh, challenge accepted.

32:02.688 --> 32:03.990
- And we're f---ing freezing.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.457
- Feel like I'm getting,
like, a second

32:05.491 --> 32:06.658
or a third wind at this point.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.794
- I totally am.
- I feel like that too.

32:08.827 --> 32:10.362
- Where do we
light things on fire?

32:10.396 --> 32:11.797
- Where can we--

32:11.830 --> 32:14.766
I don't know your name,
I'm so sorry, what's your name?

32:14.800 --> 32:16.135
- What is it?

32:16.168 --> 32:20.106
- Are you, like, um,
a god, Laertes?

32:20.139 --> 32:21.440
- Where are you from?
- Greece.

32:21.473 --> 32:22.874
- F--- yeah.

32:22.908 --> 32:24.810
- It's my favorite place
in the world.

32:24.843 --> 32:27.679
- The terrain is so romantic,
you have to be a couple.

32:27.713 --> 32:29.815
I went there by myself
and I felt like an asshole.

32:29.848 --> 32:31.750
[laughter]

32:31.783 --> 32:33.352
- I'm going for my honeymoon.
- It's that pretty, you know?

32:33.385 --> 32:35.687
- My friend lived there,
so we stayed with him.

32:35.721 --> 32:37.689
Then he had a house
and basically

32:37.723 --> 32:41.093
we drove from Athens
to there.

32:41.127 --> 32:42.728
- You're about to
exchange numbers.

32:42.761 --> 32:44.896
*

32:44.930 --> 32:46.798
What's up, ass sh-- head?

32:46.832 --> 32:48.134
- If you guys go to Greece,

32:48.167 --> 32:49.768
you will understand.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.570
And you will be obsessed
with Greece, as well.

32:51.603 --> 32:55.107
- Bottom line, Katie's never
gonna be my wing woman.

32:55.141 --> 32:57.109
[laughter]

32:57.143 --> 32:59.378
I'm starting to think that,
like, I'm gonna be single

32:59.411 --> 33:01.047
for a very long time.

33:01.047 --> 33:03.082
If this is what's out there,

33:03.115 --> 33:04.783
I'm f---ed.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.619
- Bye, thank you so much.

33:07.653 --> 33:08.887
Thank you.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.456
[bell dings]

33:11.857 --> 33:13.759
- If she's told
not to go to Sonoma,

33:13.792 --> 33:15.094
that could've been two minutes
before the plane

33:15.127 --> 33:16.562
and she wouldn't board it.

33:23.702 --> 33:24.070
[techno music]

33:26.672 --> 33:31.177
*

33:31.210 --> 33:32.878
- Hey, what's up, buddy boy?
- How you doing?

33:32.911 --> 33:34.246
- Good.
How's work?

33:34.280 --> 33:35.614
- It was brutal.

33:35.647 --> 33:37.083
- Let's go,
are you ready to go out?

33:37.083 --> 33:39.818
Ready to have a nice night?
- Uh, yeah, of course.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.353
- What're you doing here?
- Hey, Mom.

33:41.387 --> 33:43.822
- Just kidnapping him.
- Don't let him influence you.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.691
- Am I bad influence?
- I'm always looking after him.

33:45.724 --> 33:46.925
What're you talking about?
- Exactly.

33:46.958 --> 33:48.127
Go do what you've got to do.
- All right.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.761
- Yeah, let's go.
- Bye, Mom, love you.

33:49.795 --> 33:51.563
- I fired James from Sur,
but unfortunately,

33:51.597 --> 33:53.332
but unfortunately,
I can't fire him

33:53.365 --> 33:54.866
from being friends
with my son.

33:54.900 --> 33:57.803
I want to talk to you, but this
is nothing about your job,

33:57.836 --> 33:59.538
it's nothing about you
coming back here.

33:59.571 --> 34:00.572
- All right.

34:00.606 --> 34:02.241
- Have you heard
from Lala at all?

34:02.274 --> 34:03.975
- No, why?
- Do you know where she is?

34:04.009 --> 34:05.677
- She went to Sonoma
for Ariana's birthday.

34:05.711 --> 34:06.978
- She didn't go to Sonoma.

34:07.012 --> 34:08.514
- Are you serious?

34:08.547 --> 34:10.782
- No, I'm serious,
absolutely not.

34:10.816 --> 34:11.917
- That is insane.

34:11.950 --> 34:13.252
She was texting everyone
last night,

34:13.285 --> 34:14.720
saying she's so excited.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.955
- Last night she was saying
she was excited?

34:16.988 --> 34:18.990
So what's happened between
last night and today?

34:19.024 --> 34:21.227
- The only thing I can
think of is her boyfriend.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.729
Like, I mean, she--
- But who is her boyfriend?

34:23.762 --> 34:25.297
You've met him?
- I've never met him, no.

34:25.331 --> 34:26.632
- He's sneaky,
I think.

34:26.665 --> 34:30.202
Like, he kind of just, like,
follows Lala out sometimes.

34:30.236 --> 34:33.939
I feel like Lala's scared to do
what she wants to do sometimes,

34:33.972 --> 34:35.907
and I feel like Lala,
you know--

34:35.941 --> 34:37.809
if she's told
not to go to Sonoma,

34:37.843 --> 34:39.811
then she--
that could've been two minutes

34:39.845 --> 34:42.581
before the plane,
and she wouldn't board it.

34:42.614 --> 34:46.017
Like, she's completely wrapped
around this guy's finger.

34:46.051 --> 34:49.255
She wonders why everybody is so
fascinated at her relationship

34:49.288 --> 34:52.158
and it's because
she's making it so fascinating

34:52.158 --> 34:54.760
by telling everybody
a different thing about it.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.495
- I worry about that girl,
I really do.

34:56.528 --> 34:58.430
I worry that she makes
the right choices.

34:58.464 --> 34:59.598
- She's not right now.

34:59.631 --> 35:01.433
She's not making
the right choices at all.

35:01.467 --> 35:03.068
- But you've never
seen her with her boyfriend?

35:03.169 --> 35:04.803
- No, but I've been
over at her house,

35:04.836 --> 35:06.905
where she'll shut
the blinds to make sure

35:06.938 --> 35:09.175
her boyfriend doesn't walk past
and see me inside.

35:09.175 --> 35:10.476
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

35:10.509 --> 35:12.378
Or, like,
we're watching this TV show,

35:12.411 --> 35:14.546
I went like this under
the table--[knocks].

35:14.580 --> 35:16.515
And she was like,

35:16.548 --> 35:18.016
"Who's that?"

35:18.049 --> 35:20.886
I was like, "you're that scared
at a knock on the door?

35:20.919 --> 35:23.355
That's--that's what's wrong
with this relationship, Lala."

35:23.389 --> 35:25.957
- I don't know if she's dating
a married man or not,

35:25.991 --> 35:28.827
but she's dating somebody
that's shrouded in mystery,

35:28.860 --> 35:30.762
she's not allowed
to speak his name out loud,

35:30.796 --> 35:34.533
and I think Lala really deserves
a little bit better than that.

35:34.566 --> 35:36.802
All right,
just don't be a bad influence

35:36.835 --> 35:38.370
on my son, you hear me?

35:38.404 --> 35:40.539
- I'm definitely gonna be
on my best behavior tonight.

35:40.572 --> 35:42.208
No drinking, so...
- All right.

35:42.208 --> 35:43.209
All right,
I'll see you later, then.

35:43.209 --> 35:44.210
- Bye.

35:44.243 --> 35:50.782
*

35:51.783 --> 35:53.685
- Guys, should we call Tom?

35:53.719 --> 35:56.355
- Yeah, see how
the RV sleepover is going.

35:56.388 --> 35:57.756
[phone ringing]

35:57.789 --> 35:58.957
- What're you doing, Bubba?

35:58.990 --> 36:01.227
- Hi, Bubba,
we were just at the bar,

36:01.227 --> 36:02.794
making friends with
a bunch of Montauk folk.

36:02.828 --> 36:04.129
- Friendies.

36:04.230 --> 36:05.931
- Yeah, you guys,
we have a beautiful view,

36:05.964 --> 36:09.401
we have an RV, we have--maybe
an unlimited supply of beer.

36:09.435 --> 36:10.436
Everything you could ask for.

36:10.469 --> 36:11.570
- "Everything
you could ask for"?

36:11.603 --> 36:13.038
I think I could probably ask
for, like,

36:13.071 --> 36:15.441
a bunch of things
besides that.

36:15.474 --> 36:16.808
- All right,
in this given moment,

36:16.842 --> 36:18.310
it's everything I could ask for.

36:18.344 --> 36:20.078
You know, I don't want to stay
in, like, a posh,

36:20.111 --> 36:21.380
swanky hotel--I like it.

36:21.413 --> 36:22.581
- Bullsh--!

36:22.614 --> 36:24.783
- Said nobody ever!

36:24.816 --> 36:26.785
- Frankly,
I'm a little worried

36:26.818 --> 36:28.119
whether or not
Schwartz is cut out

36:28.153 --> 36:29.255
for the RV life.

36:29.255 --> 36:30.456
'Cause he loves a posh hotel

36:30.489 --> 36:31.923
more than anyone I know.

36:31.957 --> 36:34.726
He'll walk around in the robe
and the slippers,

36:34.760 --> 36:36.962
take a bath,
and if there's not a bathtub,

36:36.995 --> 36:38.964
he can't have a bubble bath,
and I'm sure it doesn't

36:38.997 --> 36:40.766
come with nice,
terry cloth robes.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.501
Bub!
- What?

36:42.534 --> 36:43.535
- We're all kind of curious,

36:43.569 --> 36:44.903
what the f---
happened with Lala?

36:44.936 --> 36:46.071
- It's an absolute mystery,

36:46.104 --> 36:47.439
we never got
to the bottom of it.

36:47.473 --> 36:48.440
What theories did we
come up with

36:48.474 --> 36:49.941
as to why Lala didn't come?

36:49.975 --> 36:51.677
Tom Sandoval's here.
- Take this one.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.078
- I gotta walk it off.
- It just--

36:53.111 --> 36:54.880
- I don't wanna get into it.
I'm--I'm not--

36:54.913 --> 36:56.615
I'm actually really
pissed off about it.

36:56.648 --> 36:58.817
There was a lot of planning
that went into this.

36:58.850 --> 37:00.151
- That's why she sucks!

37:00.185 --> 37:03.121
I'm kind of reveling
in the fact that

37:03.154 --> 37:05.023
everyone's eyes
are gonna be finally open

37:05.056 --> 37:07.025
to the fact that
this is just who she is

37:07.058 --> 37:09.395
and no one should be giving her
any allowances.

37:09.428 --> 37:10.829
- Stassi will appreciate
my theory:

37:10.862 --> 37:12.898
I think she got abducted
by Tall Grays--

37:12.931 --> 37:14.300
- Schwartz! Oh, my God.

37:14.300 --> 37:15.367
I cannot believe
you just said that.

37:15.401 --> 37:16.835
I was literally about to say

37:16.868 --> 37:19.170
that my theory was that she was
abducted from Tall Gray.

37:19.204 --> 37:20.872
Schwartz, I got you.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.641
There are many different types
of aliens.

37:22.674 --> 37:26.044
There are Short Grays,
Tall Whites, Pleiadians,

37:26.077 --> 37:27.479
but Tall Grays are my favorite.

37:27.513 --> 37:29.481
If Lala did get abducted
by aliens,

37:29.515 --> 37:31.583
I wonder what she's doing
up there in that spaceship.

37:31.617 --> 37:34.320
She's probably blowing married
Tall Grays

37:34.320 --> 37:36.422
so she can get
space Range Rovers.

37:36.455 --> 37:37.723
- I miss you. I love you.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.491
- I'm proud of you, Bubba.
I love you.

37:39.525 --> 37:40.759
- Bubba, I love it
when we don't fight.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.761
Lookit, we just call each other,
we check in.

37:42.794 --> 37:44.996
We don't--we don't be
passive-aggressive.

37:45.030 --> 37:47.165
Yeah, I think it's key
in a relationship

37:47.198 --> 37:49.335
to spend some healthy time
apart.

37:49.368 --> 37:52.838
I feel like it does wonders
for the relationship overall,

37:52.871 --> 37:54.340
and I don't want to jinx it,

37:54.373 --> 37:56.775
but it seems like there'll be
no rage texts tonight.

37:56.808 --> 37:59.345
Just sweet, short love texts.

37:59.345 --> 38:01.146
But this is the type of
relationship I'm talking about!

38:01.179 --> 38:02.381
- We're all here.
- Whoa.

38:02.414 --> 38:03.849
We're gonna get naked
and skinny-dip

38:03.882 --> 38:06.785
in the ocean, so have fun.

38:06.818 --> 38:07.786
- I'm on my way.

38:07.819 --> 38:09.187
[laughter]

38:09.220 --> 38:11.357
- Was that--that was you,
right, Bub?

38:11.357 --> 38:12.524
- All right.
All right, I love you, Bubby.

38:12.558 --> 38:13.992
I gotta go.
- Okay.

38:14.025 --> 38:14.993
- Bye, Bub.

38:15.026 --> 38:16.194
Bye. Bye, guys.

38:16.227 --> 38:17.228
- I love you.

38:17.262 --> 38:19.064
- "I'm on my way."
[laughter]

38:19.097 --> 38:20.566
- Oh, my God!

38:20.599 --> 38:22.401
- For a minute, it sounded like
it could have been Sandoval or--

38:22.434 --> 38:24.069
- I wasn't sure!
- I was like...

38:24.102 --> 38:25.604
[laughter]

38:27.873 --> 38:30.842
[light techno music]

38:30.876 --> 38:32.010
*

38:32.043 --> 38:33.379
- Good night, man.
We're going to bed.

38:33.412 --> 38:34.680
- We're going to bed.
- Bedtime.

38:34.713 --> 38:36.815
Get that booty up there;
we got NASCAR in the morning.

38:36.848 --> 38:38.049
- Good night.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.785
- I'm sleeping fully clothed--
no joke.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.252
- Jax, no snoring, man.
- Good night.

38:41.286 --> 38:42.888
- Yeah, she's taking
those pants off.

38:42.921 --> 38:43.889
Whoo-hoo!

38:43.922 --> 38:45.657
- Are you having fun so far?

38:45.691 --> 38:47.759
- Yeah.

38:47.793 --> 38:49.395
It's kind of a mess.

38:49.428 --> 38:51.196
- You know, I know a year ago,

38:51.229 --> 38:53.264
when I left
after your birthday party,

38:53.298 --> 38:54.566
you were really mad at me.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.002
Last year, for Ariana's
30th birthday,

38:57.035 --> 38:58.537
it was a milestone,

38:58.570 --> 39:00.906
and it definitely hit her hard

39:00.939 --> 39:02.441
that her dad wasn't there
for that,

39:02.474 --> 39:04.910
and then the fact that
I left for Vegas

39:04.943 --> 39:06.612
the following day didn't help.

39:06.645 --> 39:08.580
I'm always gonna be here
for you,

39:08.614 --> 39:09.915
but apparently, he told me

39:09.948 --> 39:11.817
that we're going to
a construction yard

39:11.850 --> 39:14.085
and we're taking bulldozers
and, like,

39:14.119 --> 39:15.887
crushing sh-- with bulldozers.

39:15.921 --> 39:17.989
- Okay, like, whatever, dude.

39:18.023 --> 39:21.259
You're never gonna get it.
It's fine.

39:21.292 --> 39:25.431
- I know she's in a way better
headspace this year,

39:25.431 --> 39:27.232
but I just wanna make sure that

39:27.265 --> 39:31.670
Ariana knows how important her
birthday is to me.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.639
I know this time of year
can be hard for you

39:33.672 --> 39:36.775
and, you know, I just--

39:36.808 --> 39:39.077
I wanted to make sure,
no matter what,

39:39.110 --> 39:41.647
that I was here.

39:47.853 --> 39:49.220
- I'm sorry.

39:57.128 --> 40:01.032
I think Tom has more than
redeemed himself for last year.

40:01.066 --> 40:03.234
He does it in little ways
every day

40:03.268 --> 40:05.270
and honestly,

40:05.303 --> 40:07.773
I have no greater ally.

40:07.806 --> 40:09.608
- Oh, my God!

40:09.641 --> 40:10.776
Oh, this is perfect right here.

40:10.809 --> 40:13.579
Oh, this is it. This is it.

40:13.612 --> 40:14.613
[farting]

40:14.646 --> 40:16.848
- Ew, man. Did you f---ing fart?

40:16.882 --> 40:19.417
- Farts are not allowed!
- Oh, that's getting worse!

40:19.451 --> 40:20.452
- Good night, assholes!

40:22.654 --> 40:24.155
[giggling]

40:24.189 --> 40:27.158
[cheering]

40:33.264 --> 40:33.699
[upbeat pop music]

40:35.901 --> 40:38.470
- Is this the part where we get
naked and go jump in the ocean?

40:38.504 --> 40:39.805
- Yeah.
- Yes, it is!

40:39.838 --> 40:41.039
- I'll videotape you guys.

40:41.072 --> 40:42.440
- Come on!
- Girl, I am freezing already.

40:42.474 --> 40:44.009
I'm not jumping in
freezing cold water.

40:44.042 --> 40:45.677
- I don't give a flying f---.
We have robes and towels.

40:45.711 --> 40:47.112
- I don't care.
I'm not doing it.

40:47.145 --> 40:48.780
- I hate to break it to you,
but you're going in there.

40:48.814 --> 40:50.949
- But I'm not.
- This is a pledge.

40:50.982 --> 40:52.684
- No, it sounds like
peer pressure.

40:52.718 --> 40:55.487
It sounds like all three of you
ganging up on me.

40:55.521 --> 40:57.523
- How did Scheana
not get the memo

40:57.556 --> 40:58.924
that on Stassi's birthday,

40:58.957 --> 41:01.793
we get naked and we jump
into bodies of water?

41:01.827 --> 41:06.532
[giggling]

41:06.532 --> 41:07.599
- Oh!

41:07.633 --> 41:08.900
- Her toe just went up
her vagina.

41:08.934 --> 41:10.068
[indistinct chatter]

41:10.101 --> 41:12.203
[screaming]

41:12.237 --> 41:14.039
- Oh, I'm so cold.
- The dirt is now up my ass.

41:14.072 --> 41:16.775
- Get with it.
It's not that hard.

41:16.808 --> 41:19.778
[upbeat music]

41:19.811 --> 41:23.849
*

41:23.882 --> 41:25.651
- I'm gonna be right here.

41:25.684 --> 41:27.185
Love you!

41:27.218 --> 41:28.620
*

41:28.654 --> 41:30.388
- * Don't stop now
- One, two...

41:30.421 --> 41:32.157
- * I feel like getting naked

41:32.190 --> 41:34.159
[giggling]

41:34.192 --> 41:36.595
*

41:36.628 --> 41:37.896
- Oh, my God!

41:37.929 --> 41:39.931
- * I feel like getting naked

41:39.965 --> 41:43.034
- * Now take it off
- [laughing]

41:43.068 --> 41:44.903
[cheers and applause]

41:44.936 --> 41:48.373
- Oh, my God!
- [laughing]

41:48.406 --> 41:50.408
- Scheana!
- * I feel like getting naked

41:50.441 --> 41:53.945
- Right now.
Do what I say, right now!

41:53.979 --> 41:54.946
Really?

41:54.980 --> 41:56.114
A lighthouse is pointed

41:56.147 --> 41:58.083
directly at my f---ing
naked body

41:58.116 --> 41:59.585
and people are cheering at us?

41:59.585 --> 42:01.587
[cheers and whistling]

42:01.620 --> 42:03.454
- What?

42:03.488 --> 42:05.390
All these things are happening.

42:05.423 --> 42:08.293
- I'm here--
- No one talk to me.

42:08.326 --> 42:10.762
[laughter]
No one talk to me.

42:10.796 --> 42:12.263
It's not a Rihanna concert.

42:12.297 --> 42:13.865
Everybody, shut up.

42:13.899 --> 42:15.734
- * I feel like getting naked

42:15.767 --> 42:17.168
[cheers and whistling]

42:17.202 --> 42:19.104
- Next time
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:19.137 --> 42:20.606
- There they go!
- There they go!

42:20.606 --> 42:21.973
all: Oh!

42:22.007 --> 42:24.643
- Dude, Jax, you f---ing
tortured her this morning.

42:24.676 --> 42:26.712
- If I ask once in a while,
"Hey, can I have a sandwich?

42:26.745 --> 42:28.279
Or can I do my laundry as well?"

42:28.313 --> 42:30.782
Dude, I'd bow down if I was--
the reverse situation.

42:30.816 --> 42:32.818
- If I were Brittany,
Jax would either be bleeding,

42:32.851 --> 42:34.085
or dead right now.

42:34.119 --> 42:36.421
- Stassi's here.
- Hi!

42:36.454 --> 42:37.889
- Do you think
there's some talent here

42:37.923 --> 42:40.125
for you to exercise
your single muscle?

42:40.158 --> 42:42.861
- The one right in front of me
is who I would normally go for.

42:42.894 --> 42:44.630
- So, Kyle.

42:44.630 --> 42:46.865
- Lala, I really don't know
what's going on.

42:46.898 --> 42:49.467
All I know is you give
as good as you get.

42:49.500 --> 42:52.938
- I think it's best for me to
walk away from this workplace.

42:52.971 --> 42:54.439
