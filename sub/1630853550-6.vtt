WEBVTT

00:01.784 --> 00:03.394
Previously on
Roswell, New Mexico...The alighting.

00:03.438 --> 00:04.961
What do they want with me?You're the Savior.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.658
Now that you're all grown up,
they'll come.

00:06.702 --> 00:09.139
TEZCA: This is what our Triad
is meant to do.

00:09.183 --> 00:11.620
Just as Ophiuchus has a plan
for you, Max,

00:11.663 --> 00:12.751
it has one for her.

00:12.795 --> 00:13.883
No!

00:13.926 --> 00:15.276
Max.

00:15.319 --> 00:17.713
MAX:
I'm sorry. I'm gonna fix this.

00:17.756 --> 00:19.628
"There are things
in Careyes

00:19.671 --> 00:21.195
you'd find interesting."

00:21.238 --> 00:23.501
You are the Valenti Careyes
point person.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.329
Do you have any idea who might
have sent that letter?

00:25.373 --> 00:27.549
Probably the crazy guüera
Allie Meyers.

00:27.592 --> 00:29.551
Anatsa taught me
not to be afraid to love again.

00:29.594 --> 00:31.031
Powers on the fritz?

00:34.730 --> 00:36.514
Clyde?

00:36.558 --> 00:38.429
Okay, forget everything
you thought you knew about

00:38.473 --> 00:41.345
breakfast burritos, because
this one has tater tots in it.

00:43.826 --> 00:44.914
Where's Clyde?

00:46.089 --> 00:49.223
Out of town.
Retrieving something for me.

00:50.441 --> 00:52.095
Why wouldn't he ask me
to come with him?

00:52.139 --> 00:53.227
I give the orders.

00:53.270 --> 00:55.620
Did he go after the final piece?

00:57.318 --> 00:58.754
The final piece?

01:00.234 --> 01:02.671
I just wanted to know
if we're-we're going home soon.

01:04.238 --> 01:05.848
What else would the plan be?

01:10.722 --> 01:14.900
And to accomplish said plan,
no more Earthly distractions.

01:14.944 --> 01:16.946
I'm committed.

01:16.989 --> 01:18.774
Of course you are.

01:18.817 --> 01:20.645
You took care of Eduardo,
after all.

01:21.646 --> 01:23.083
He's never coming back.

01:26.260 --> 01:28.218
Good.

01:29.654 --> 01:32.396
Now I need you to do the same
to your new friend.

01:32.440 --> 01:33.702
Michael.

01:43.015 --> 01:44.234
LIZ: You're up early.

01:45.409 --> 01:46.584
Meditating.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.893
Trying to learn
to control myself

01:50.936 --> 01:52.416
so last night
doesn't happen again.

01:52.460 --> 01:54.723
But it's hard to
find inner peace

01:54.766 --> 01:56.203
when every time I close my eyes

01:56.246 --> 01:59.293
I see myself nearly killing you.

01:59.336 --> 02:00.990
You also saved me, Max.

02:01.033 --> 02:02.122
Look.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.037
It's like I got signed
by an alien rock star.

02:05.081 --> 02:06.213
Liz.

02:07.257 --> 02:08.867
I feel what you feel,

02:08.911 --> 02:10.347
through the handprint, okay?

02:10.391 --> 02:11.783
I know you're terrified
about what I did,

02:11.827 --> 02:15.526
or what... what I might do next.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.441
Maybe I am.

02:17.485 --> 02:19.791
But you got to remember, the
handprint's a two-way street.

02:19.835 --> 02:22.272
And I know
you're scared, too,

02:22.316 --> 02:23.969
and feeling guilty.

02:24.013 --> 02:28.670
I don't understand how
to control this power

02:28.713 --> 02:30.193
or what Tezca wants with it.

02:30.237 --> 02:31.977
You're gonna learn
how to control it.

02:32.021 --> 02:34.284
[scoffs]

02:34.328 --> 02:37.374
I can't control
her interest in you.

02:37.418 --> 02:39.202
I mean, Jones gave her
your name.

02:39.246 --> 02:41.117
They're after you, Liz,
and you saw

02:41.161 --> 02:43.772
the look in her eyes,
t-the wheels turning.

02:43.815 --> 02:45.643
We can handle it.
You and me?

02:45.687 --> 02:49.734
Max, my God,
we have survived worse things.

02:49.778 --> 02:52.302
We can do this.

02:52.346 --> 02:53.912
You know, we should
call the DoD.

02:53.956 --> 02:55.610
Maybe they can bottle our love.

02:55.653 --> 02:58.526
I'm serious.

02:58.569 --> 03:02.051
What better way to combat
the anger and the fear

03:02.094 --> 03:05.097
you're feeling than remembering
how loved you are?

03:12.104 --> 03:13.236
Here.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.933
And who is this?

03:14.977 --> 03:16.457
You remember.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.502
My dad, he sends them to me
everywhere I go.

03:18.546 --> 03:20.809
It's a reminder
that there's always someone

03:20.852 --> 03:23.377
who has my back.

03:23.420 --> 03:27.468
It's a partner to ride with you
when I can't.

03:27.511 --> 03:28.904
[phone chimes]

03:28.947 --> 03:31.036
Oh.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.255
It's Maria.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.518
She says Michael is sick.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.041
We don't get sick.

03:37.129 --> 03:38.783
LIZ:
108?

03:38.827 --> 03:40.394
Aliens usually run at 102.

03:40.437 --> 03:41.612
[coughs]
MAX:
We've never had a fever.

03:41.656 --> 03:43.614
When did this start?

03:43.658 --> 03:46.400
Last night. Dallas thought
he would sleep it off, but...

03:46.443 --> 03:48.576
[hoarse]: But I'm dying.MARIA: You're not dying.

03:48.619 --> 03:50.186
[whispers]: Is he dying?

03:50.230 --> 03:52.057
I have run every test
I can possibly think of.

03:52.101 --> 03:54.843
He has multiple strands
of the flu,

03:54.886 --> 03:57.280
strep and the common cold.

03:57.324 --> 03:58.934
I mean, all at once.
It's like he suddenly has

03:58.977 --> 04:00.805
the immune system of an infant.

04:00.849 --> 04:03.025
Why, Liz, does everything ache?

04:03.068 --> 04:04.374
Will you make it go away?

04:04.418 --> 04:05.854
Well, he's definitely
an infant.

04:05.897 --> 04:07.638
Hey.Do you have any other symptoms?

04:07.682 --> 04:10.815
Yeah, my alien mojo. Missing.

04:13.514 --> 04:14.428
Whoa.

04:14.471 --> 04:15.559
[coughing]

04:15.603 --> 04:17.126
That makes sense, actually.

04:17.169 --> 04:18.780
The regenerative
protein that keeps you

04:18.823 --> 04:19.955
from getting sick
is the same place

04:19.998 --> 04:21.086
where you derive your powers.

04:21.130 --> 04:22.436
So, uh,
what took me down--

04:22.479 --> 04:24.351
some kind of superbug?

04:24.394 --> 04:26.353
Maybe there's a connection
with the alien fruit?

04:26.396 --> 04:27.963
Dallas ate it, too.

04:28.006 --> 04:29.573
What if it was exposure
to the octahedron?

04:29.617 --> 04:30.748
Well, l-let's not jump
to any conclusions,

04:30.792 --> 04:32.315
okay?[phone ringing]

04:32.359 --> 04:33.925
I'm gonna take the
samples to Senovative.

04:33.969 --> 04:35.536
Science is gonna solve
this mystery.Yeah.

04:35.579 --> 04:38.147
Yeah, of course,
I'll be right there.

04:38.190 --> 04:39.279
[coughing]What is it?

04:39.322 --> 04:40.976
Uh, a couple of my deputies

04:41.019 --> 04:43.631
just picked up a vandal
at Take Me To Your Latte.

04:43.674 --> 04:44.849
Pretty sure your boys in beige
can handle

04:44.893 --> 04:46.416
a misdemeanor without you.

04:46.460 --> 04:48.200
The vandal is Bonnie.

04:48.244 --> 04:50.290
She's insisting on
talking to only me.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.988
Shotgun.
I know her better than anyone.

04:53.031 --> 04:54.685
Hey, you can barely
get out of bed.

04:54.729 --> 04:56.513
You think you're gonna run point
on an interrogation?

04:56.557 --> 04:58.820
I promised that I would
protect her.

04:58.863 --> 05:00.691
Let me keep that promise,
okay? You rest.

05:02.998 --> 05:04.347
Are you sure you're okay?

05:04.391 --> 05:05.696
Face-to-face
with an alien again?

05:05.740 --> 05:07.045
[sighs]

05:08.090 --> 05:09.352
I got backup.

05:21.495 --> 05:22.496
Good morning.

05:22.539 --> 05:23.627
[exhales]

05:23.671 --> 05:26.282
[both laugh]

05:26.326 --> 05:27.370
Good morning.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.416
Sorry, I did not mean

05:29.459 --> 05:33.637
to, um, to use
your pec as a-as a pillow.

05:33.681 --> 05:36.466
No. No, use me.

05:36.510 --> 05:38.207
That's what I'm here for.

05:38.250 --> 05:41.906
Wait, do you...
do you feel used?

05:43.604 --> 05:46.041
Oh, my God,
of course you feel used.Oh, no.

05:46.084 --> 05:47.477
Of all the men in Mexico,

05:47.521 --> 05:49.392
of course I had to rebound
with Kyle Valenti.

05:49.436 --> 05:51.655
Um...Did I-did I just...

05:51.699 --> 05:53.309
did I just ruin our friendship?

05:55.529 --> 05:56.791
No.

05:56.834 --> 05:59.141
No, of course
not. I mean...

05:59.184 --> 06:01.056
we both knew what this was.

06:01.099 --> 06:03.841
Right? Just...

06:03.885 --> 06:05.669
two friends blowing off steam.

06:05.713 --> 06:08.063
[exhales] Oh, my God,
thank God, thank God.

06:08.106 --> 06:11.719
I was just so worried
that I'd made it awkward,

06:11.762 --> 06:13.938
No, not at all.Thank God.

06:13.982 --> 06:16.811
Because, honestly,
Kyle, that was...

06:16.854 --> 06:19.204
exactly what I needed.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.729
Very impressed.

06:21.772 --> 06:22.947
Oh.

06:22.991 --> 06:25.863
Two thumbs... way up.

06:33.044 --> 06:36.352
Um, I'm gonna
make us some coffee.

06:38.136 --> 06:39.834
Sure.

06:39.877 --> 06:41.139
[grunts]

06:45.100 --> 06:48.233
And I'm... naked.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.250
I know

07:05.294 --> 07:06.948
you could use telekinesis
to open that jail cell

07:06.991 --> 07:08.166
and walk out of here.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.560
So, why are you really here?

07:10.604 --> 07:13.258
To talk. This was the safest
place I could think of.

07:15.565 --> 07:18.176
And why would you want
to talk to me?

07:18.220 --> 07:22.224
Everyone keeps going on
about you being the savior.

07:22.267 --> 07:23.573
Well,

07:23.617 --> 07:25.662
I need you to save me.

07:31.538 --> 07:35.498
So, your coffee--
uh, cream and sugar?

07:35.542 --> 07:37.631
Kyle, I really feel like
we should maybe talk about this?

07:37.674 --> 07:38.806
SONYA:
Talk about what--

07:38.849 --> 07:40.547
that you had sex?

07:40.590 --> 07:42.244
Uh...Don't play dumb, primo.

07:42.287 --> 07:43.985
Your shirt's on backwards.

07:44.028 --> 07:46.074
Oh, your friend Liz
emailed the instructions

07:46.117 --> 07:47.728
to fix my freaky Frodo eyes.

07:47.771 --> 07:48.946
Do you think you can keep
your pants on long enough

07:48.990 --> 07:50.034
to help me out?

07:50.078 --> 07:51.514
That won't be a problem.

07:51.558 --> 07:54.778
Last night was just
a one-time thing.

07:54.822 --> 07:57.520
Well, technically,
two times for some of us,

07:57.564 --> 07:59.261
but message received.

07:59.304 --> 08:01.002
[knocking on door]Thank God.

08:01.045 --> 08:02.090
An escape hatch.

08:07.225 --> 08:08.879
Dad?

08:08.923 --> 08:11.795
All the mysteries of the
universe at your fingertips,

08:11.839 --> 08:13.623
and you can't
figure out

08:13.667 --> 08:15.059
how to work a phone?

08:16.104 --> 08:17.279
I was afraid if I called,

08:17.322 --> 08:18.715
you'd tell me not to come.

08:18.759 --> 08:20.021
You were right.

08:20.064 --> 08:21.196
I deserve that.

08:21.239 --> 08:22.719
You deserve worse

08:22.763 --> 08:24.895
for not standing by
your own daughter.

08:24.939 --> 08:27.463
Kyle told me you ran into
an alien wearing my skin

08:27.507 --> 08:30.248
like some sci-fi Buffalo Bill.

08:31.249 --> 08:32.424
Tell me,

08:32.468 --> 08:33.948
when was the last time

08:33.991 --> 08:35.689
you gave me a second thought?

08:35.732 --> 08:39.040
When that shapeshifter
locked me up in her hideout,

08:39.083 --> 08:42.173
you were all
I could think about.

08:43.218 --> 08:44.959
It was a wake-up call.

08:45.002 --> 08:46.830
Wondering what
she'd done to you.

08:46.874 --> 08:49.311
If I'd lost you forever.

08:52.270 --> 08:56.100
You've already been pretending
I'm dead for a decade.

08:56.144 --> 08:58.320
Why stop now?

09:04.848 --> 09:06.154
SHIVANI:
Hey.

09:06.197 --> 09:07.285
What are you working on?

09:07.329 --> 09:08.417
Reexamining that sample we found

09:08.460 --> 09:10.332
at the oil derrick.

09:10.375 --> 09:13.335
You don't have to keep your
little alien secrets from me.

09:13.378 --> 09:15.206
That's clearly
a new sample.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.600
It's not epidermal tissue,
it's saliva.

09:17.644 --> 09:20.647
And look, this looks
like an alien virus.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.344
Mm, human viruses.

09:22.387 --> 09:23.519
Which is strange,

09:23.563 --> 09:24.738
because it's an alien sample.

09:24.781 --> 09:27.131
No, I think it's an alien virus.

09:27.175 --> 09:28.829
See? Triple helix.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.875
You're a futurist.
How did you see that?

09:31.919 --> 09:34.095
Oh, after a decade
married to a scientist,

09:34.138 --> 09:36.184
you get pretty good
at looking over shoulders.

09:36.227 --> 09:39.622
Allie filled an
entire hard drive

09:39.666 --> 09:41.798
of biological anomalies.

09:41.842 --> 09:43.757
There should be
something alien in there.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.149
You think you got
a copy somewhere?

09:45.193 --> 09:46.716
I always keep a backup.

09:49.153 --> 09:52.722
Alex, it's Maria,
leaving you another message

09:52.766 --> 09:55.333
to let you know
your boyfriend is sick.

09:55.377 --> 09:58.249
Can you please get
some cell service?

09:58.293 --> 09:59.903
Call us back.[thudding]

09:59.947 --> 10:01.949
[Michael groans]

10:01.992 --> 10:04.255
I know Alex is busy,
but you would think

10:04.299 --> 10:05.343
he would check in.

10:05.387 --> 10:06.736
Yeah.

10:06.780 --> 10:07.868
Hey.

10:07.911 --> 10:09.739
Any improvement, big guy?

10:10.871 --> 10:12.655
Accio,Alex.

10:13.700 --> 10:14.788
[clears throat]

10:14.831 --> 10:16.224
Still no powers.

10:16.267 --> 10:18.313
Well, you know
what I was thinking?

10:18.356 --> 10:20.184
You're not totally powerless.

10:20.228 --> 10:22.317
You're still a great engineer.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.536
Yeah, maybe the Avengers
could use a roadie.

10:24.580 --> 10:27.409
Snark aside, I need your help.

10:27.452 --> 10:29.672
This is the glass
that my dad embedded

10:29.716 --> 10:32.719
the equation to decouple
Max from Jones on.

10:32.762 --> 10:33.981
Well, now it looks
like the s'more

10:34.024 --> 10:35.330
that fell on the campfire.

10:35.373 --> 10:36.897
Yeah, hence the help.

10:36.940 --> 10:39.508
Look, I-I don't know how
much is still usable,

10:39.551 --> 10:42.206
but I was hoping maybe we could
try to recover what we can,

10:42.250 --> 10:43.860
look for clues on it?

10:43.904 --> 10:45.601
You think we overlooked
something?

10:45.645 --> 10:47.690
Maybe. It can't hurt to try.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.910
Uh, I got Kyle
to get Deep Sky

10:49.953 --> 10:51.868
to loan me the Lockhart machine.

10:51.912 --> 10:54.305
I was thinking maybe you could
make some adjustments to it,

10:54.349 --> 10:56.090
get a broken DVD to play again?

10:57.134 --> 10:58.353
All right.

11:00.311 --> 11:02.574
I will take a crack at it.

11:07.884 --> 11:10.844
This is a worry doll, right?

11:10.887 --> 11:12.584
Allie bought it for me

11:12.628 --> 11:15.631
at a tourist shop
a million years ago.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.068
Mm, to remember her
when she wasn't around.

11:18.112 --> 11:19.635
You tell the
doll your worries

11:19.679 --> 11:21.115
and it takes care of them
for you.

11:22.116 --> 11:23.421
Can't say it worked.

11:24.814 --> 11:27.643
I can't imagine what it's like
to have a sick kid.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.167
You think having a partner
will help,

11:30.211 --> 11:32.169
but they're in just as much pain
as you are.

11:32.213 --> 11:33.562
And we tried
to support each other

11:33.605 --> 11:34.781
however we could.

11:34.824 --> 11:36.565
Max and I do the same thing.

11:36.608 --> 11:39.481
Yeah?
I actually gave him
one of these today.

11:39.524 --> 11:41.396
That's nice.

11:41.439 --> 11:43.224
I mean, all those
supportive words,

11:43.267 --> 11:47.228
the little tokens,
they're just stopgaps.

11:47.271 --> 11:50.753
Band-Aids over
gaping wounds.

11:50.797 --> 11:53.321
Words can't change
painful realities.

11:53.364 --> 11:54.801
What can?

11:55.976 --> 11:57.934
Maybe nothing.

11:57.978 --> 12:00.328
Maybe it's all just
coping mechanisms.

12:00.371 --> 12:02.896
We spent years trying to cure
our daughter's illness together,

12:02.939 --> 12:04.898
but we still drifted apart.

12:04.941 --> 12:06.769
You're gonna find that cure.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.729
And then you're gonna find
your way back to Allie.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.208
I don't believe

12:11.252 --> 12:12.862
any situation is hopeless.

12:14.385 --> 12:16.474
That's what I like
about you, Liz.

12:16.518 --> 12:18.085
That optimism.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.401
Come on, methane leak.
Move, people, move.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.490
I'll transfer the prisoner
and then supervise the repair.

12:32.534 --> 12:34.057
I'll call you
when it's all clear.

12:35.450 --> 12:36.973
That's a fake leak, right?

12:37.017 --> 12:38.627
[door closes]

12:39.628 --> 12:40.760
You wanted to talk?

12:40.803 --> 12:42.283
Talk.

12:42.326 --> 12:43.806
If you need protection,
I need to know

12:43.850 --> 12:46.200
who you are and what
I'm protecting you from.

12:47.201 --> 12:48.376
You think this is a trap.

12:49.638 --> 12:52.206
I know Jones had plans
to get back to Oasis,

12:52.249 --> 12:54.730
so tell me,
how are you gonna do that?

12:54.774 --> 12:56.645
You think Tezca would tell me
something like that?

12:56.688 --> 12:57.820
Didn't answer the question.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.126
I would if I could.

12:59.169 --> 13:00.736
All I know is that the alighting

13:00.780 --> 13:02.042
is already in motion.

13:09.832 --> 13:12.139
Alighting.
How do you know that word?

13:12.182 --> 13:13.749
Tezca keeps saying it.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.142
I was hoping you knew
what it meant.

13:15.185 --> 13:17.100
Well, I knew someone
who said it once.

13:20.147 --> 13:21.888
Noah Bracken.

13:21.931 --> 13:23.280
Friend of yours?

13:23.324 --> 13:25.021
No, he was no one's friend.

13:25.065 --> 13:27.067
H-He did the things
no one else wanted to do

13:27.110 --> 13:28.808
and took pleasure in doing them.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.505
And the blue flame?

13:30.548 --> 13:32.507
What does Tezca want with it?

13:34.117 --> 13:36.337
The way Tezca speaks, the...

13:36.380 --> 13:39.166
the puzzle isn't complete
without you and...

13:39.209 --> 13:41.124
And Liz?

13:42.647 --> 13:43.823
We shouldn't talk about her.

13:43.866 --> 13:47.130
Tezca says
it makes you angry.

13:47.174 --> 13:50.264
Liz and I are not puzzle pieces.

13:50.307 --> 13:52.440
No, I-I, um...

13:52.483 --> 13:55.399
I think that you're somehow the
glue that holds them together.

14:09.892 --> 14:13.069
All right.
[exhales]

14:13.113 --> 14:15.506
You could've found me weeks ago.

14:15.550 --> 14:16.943
Why now?

14:16.986 --> 14:18.553
Tezca ordered me
to do something,

14:18.596 --> 14:20.033
and I couldn't do it.

14:21.077 --> 14:22.513
And what's that?

14:22.557 --> 14:23.863
Kill Michael.

14:25.168 --> 14:27.257
Why would she want Michael dead?

14:27.301 --> 14:29.172
There's a rift in our Triad.

14:29.216 --> 14:31.087
Clyde has been...

14:31.131 --> 14:34.047
he's been questioning
her leadership.

14:34.090 --> 14:36.571
And she can feel me
pulling away, so...

14:36.614 --> 14:38.094
two birds with one stone.

14:38.138 --> 14:39.835
Remove a threat
and keep me in line.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.968
Why does she need you in line?

14:42.011 --> 14:44.274
What is your piece
of the puzzle?

14:47.538 --> 14:48.713
You came hereto talk,

14:48.757 --> 14:50.933
and you are not talking.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.588
[grunts]

14:56.417 --> 14:58.462
I will be in
my office,

14:58.506 --> 15:00.464
when you decide
to quit playing games.

15:04.686 --> 15:06.209
MARIA:
Soup's almost ready.

15:06.253 --> 15:07.776
I just can't remember
one last ingredient

15:07.819 --> 15:08.864
from my mom's recipe.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.561
MICHAEL:
Oh, no worry.

15:10.605 --> 15:11.693
I'm so stuffed up,
I couldn't taste Sanders' boot

15:11.736 --> 15:12.781
if he stepped on my tongue.

15:12.824 --> 15:14.391
[soft laughter]

15:15.566 --> 15:17.090
What the...?

15:19.701 --> 15:21.355
DALLAS:
Oh, come on.

15:21.398 --> 15:22.660
Show's about to start.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.012
MARIA:
All right.

15:26.055 --> 15:28.405
So, how does this work?

15:28.449 --> 15:30.625
We get to talk to your father?

15:30.668 --> 15:34.063
Uh, his consciousness,
if we get lucky.

15:34.107 --> 15:36.936
All right. Here goes nothing.

15:39.068 --> 15:41.027
Hello, son.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.680
If you're seeing this,
it means my time

15:42.724 --> 15:44.552
on this planet has passed.

15:44.595 --> 15:47.207
I wish I could answer
all your questions, but sadly

15:47.250 --> 15:48.208
there are restrictions.

15:48.251 --> 15:49.687
Dad?

15:49.731 --> 15:51.254
Merely his consciousness,
but that...

15:51.298 --> 15:53.953
No, this is, this is just
what he said last time.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.345
MICHAEL:Maybe it's like
Space Alexa.

15:55.389 --> 15:56.868
Ask it what
you want to know.

15:56.912 --> 15:58.392
Dad?

15:58.435 --> 16:01.177
What do I need to know
about the tree in the sea?

16:01.221 --> 16:03.701
It's the triquetra.

16:03.745 --> 16:05.312
In-in his locket.
W-Wait, what is this?

16:05.355 --> 16:06.748
THEO:
In the wrong hands,

16:06.791 --> 16:08.141
they could bring ruin
to our home.

16:08.184 --> 16:09.359
Wait, Dad.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.057
Dad!

16:13.059 --> 16:14.799
Is that it?Yeah, that's it.

16:14.843 --> 16:16.018
I'm sorry, Dallas.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.715
It's just another dead end, man.

16:19.630 --> 16:21.502
Maybe not.

16:21.545 --> 16:22.764
That Bible.

16:24.331 --> 16:25.462
There.

16:25.506 --> 16:26.942
I recognize it.What?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.465
Wait, how is,
how is that possible?

16:28.509 --> 16:30.032
MICHAEL:
The embossing,
that-that embossing

16:30.076 --> 16:31.294
is so specific,
I saw it in Bonnie's cave.

16:34.210 --> 16:35.995
I thought you might
want some company.

16:36.038 --> 16:39.824
Generous of you to think
I deserve sympathy.

16:39.868 --> 16:42.349
Well, after what
I saw back there,

16:42.392 --> 16:44.438
you at least deserve a drink.

16:52.750 --> 16:55.362
That package Isobel found,
the one that led you here?

16:56.493 --> 16:58.060
When it arrived,
I saw that postmark

16:58.104 --> 17:00.584
from Careyes and I just froze.

17:00.628 --> 17:03.065
I couldn't open it.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.633
I was too afraid to hear
what she had to say.

17:05.676 --> 17:07.156
But if I'd opened it sooner,

17:07.200 --> 17:09.071
I might have realized
what happened.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.639
But Sonya almost died because
I was too much of a coward

17:11.682 --> 17:13.554
to own up to my own mistakes.

17:13.597 --> 17:16.818
That package wasn't sent
from Sonya.

17:16.861 --> 17:18.167
That was probably sent

17:18.211 --> 17:20.126
from a scientist
named Allie Meyers.

17:20.169 --> 17:21.562
[sighs]

17:21.605 --> 17:23.651
You were too busy
beating yourself up,

17:23.694 --> 17:25.696
you didn't bother
to get your facts straight.

17:25.740 --> 17:31.093
Appears being thorough is
a reoccurring problem of mine.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.617
What happened between you two?

17:33.661 --> 17:35.663
When Sonya was a teenager,

17:35.706 --> 17:38.796
she and I didn't exactly
see eye to eye.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.277
So you're a little bit country,

17:41.321 --> 17:43.932
she's a little bit
rock and roll.

17:43.975 --> 17:46.326
Ah, the way she'd tell it,
she's Rage Against the Machine

17:46.369 --> 17:48.110
and I'm the Machine.

17:49.372 --> 17:50.808
She got it into her head
that Deep Sky

17:50.852 --> 17:53.420
was profiting
off alien secrets.

17:53.463 --> 17:55.683
She tried to hack our accounts
and play Robin Hood.

17:55.726 --> 17:57.598
She was labeled an extremist.

17:57.641 --> 18:03.212
I felt like I had to distance
myself from her, to protect her.

18:04.257 --> 18:07.695
To protect myself and my career.

18:09.262 --> 18:13.222
[sighs] But I never meant
to estrange us forever.

18:13.266 --> 18:16.138
Well, you're doing
the right thing now.

18:16.182 --> 18:19.489
Kyle, I was too afraid
to have this conversation

18:19.533 --> 18:22.927
because I was afraid
of what she might say.

18:22.971 --> 18:26.235
And now I realize
how much more it hurts

18:26.279 --> 18:29.195
to never get to hear
what she feels at all.

18:33.895 --> 18:36.158
[computer beeping]

18:36.202 --> 18:38.769
The virus is attacking
the regenerative protein.

18:38.813 --> 18:40.684
SHIVANI:
Incredible.

18:40.728 --> 18:42.686
Except the virus burns
right through them.

18:42.730 --> 18:45.689
I mean, it's strange, this-this
virus was clearly built

18:45.733 --> 18:47.169
to replicate inside of a host,

18:47.213 --> 18:48.953
but it's not replicating
in this sample.

18:49.998 --> 18:52.348
Which means your friend

18:52.392 --> 18:53.958
can't spread it.

18:54.002 --> 18:55.525
But someone else did.

18:55.569 --> 18:58.659
A virus like this
would require close contact.

18:58.702 --> 19:01.183
I mean, close.

19:02.402 --> 19:04.404
[phone buzzing]

19:04.447 --> 19:06.319
[exhales]
Yeah?

19:06.362 --> 19:09.235
How close have you gotten
to Bonnie and Clyde?

19:09.278 --> 19:11.193
In a sitting indoors unmasked
kind of way.

19:11.237 --> 19:13.891
We haven't formed
any blood bonds or anything.

19:13.935 --> 19:16.242
Any other kinds of bonds?

19:17.286 --> 19:19.158
Uh, Bonnie...

19:20.420 --> 19:21.943
...she did kiss me.

19:23.336 --> 19:24.815
I don't think she kissed you

19:24.859 --> 19:26.861
'cause she finds
your sarcasm irresistible.

19:26.904 --> 19:29.298
I think she kissed you

19:29.342 --> 19:31.779
so she could disable
your powers.

19:39.352 --> 19:41.223
[coughs] You! Are you the reason
I don't have any powers?

19:41.267 --> 19:43.094
Yo, what are you doing here?
You should be resting.

19:43.138 --> 19:44.444
You stay away
from her, Max,

19:44.487 --> 19:46.054
unless you want
your own postnasal drip.

19:46.097 --> 19:47.403
You're sick?
That's never happened before.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.318
Hold up. You did it on purpose?

19:49.362 --> 19:51.146
Michael, I can explain.
I was just trying to help.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.974
So that's your ability.
You disable powers.

19:53.017 --> 19:54.758
I never should've let you
go undercover.

19:54.802 --> 19:56.891
Save it, Max.

20:00.329 --> 20:01.939
We're in your mindscape.

20:01.983 --> 20:04.594
Where you can only tell
the truth. For once.

20:06.030 --> 20:07.423
The guitar lessons,

20:07.467 --> 20:09.164
the fireside chats,
it was all a lie.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.731
Oh, you're gonna accuse me
of double-crossing you

20:10.774 --> 20:12.385
when you went and gave me
a Dementor's kiss?

20:12.428 --> 20:13.603
I was protecting you.

20:13.647 --> 20:15.039
The moment
Clyde realized

20:15.083 --> 20:16.432
that you were
the Dictator's heir,

20:16.476 --> 20:18.173
he knew he could use you
for his own gain.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.914
You act like Clyde
is some kind of puppet master,

20:19.957 --> 20:21.916
when I have him eating
out of the palm of my hand.

20:21.959 --> 20:23.831
Or are you too blinded
by his stories of Oasis

20:23.874 --> 20:25.267
to feel him reeling you in?

20:25.311 --> 20:26.964
If Clyde offered
to take you home,

20:27.008 --> 20:28.227
would you go?

20:30.620 --> 20:32.318
It's a complicated question.

20:32.361 --> 20:34.276
Because you can't lie
to yourself in here, either.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.017
Because I've been dreaming of
home since I was a foster kid.

20:36.060 --> 20:37.497
That is what Clyde preyed on.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.760
I know because I was
a lost kid, too.

20:39.803 --> 20:40.761
I kissed you

20:40.804 --> 20:41.805
to save you from falling

20:41.849 --> 20:43.111
into the same trap as me.

20:43.154 --> 20:46.288
Oh, you didn't save me!

20:46.332 --> 20:48.638
You erased me.

20:50.945 --> 20:53.556
I feel like I'm in an episode
of Storage Wars.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.559
Or Marie Kondo's nightmares.

20:58.866 --> 21:00.302
But Michael said
he saw the Bible

21:00.346 --> 21:02.304
amongst all of Bonnie's
keepsakes,

21:02.348 --> 21:04.654
so it's got to be here
somewhere.

21:06.961 --> 21:08.615
It's here. It's here.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.881
The Bible,

21:13.924 --> 21:15.665
the triquetra necklace.

21:15.709 --> 21:19.321
Do you think your dad
found God when he was on Earth?

21:19.365 --> 21:21.671
Maybe he was drawn to a story
of persecuted people

21:21.715 --> 21:24.283
making a life for themselves
in new lands.

21:24.326 --> 21:28.548
Hmm, apple doesn't fall far
from the alien tree, huh?

21:28.591 --> 21:31.333
Huh. Speaking of.

21:32.465 --> 21:34.249
Does this mean
anything to you?

21:34.293 --> 21:35.729
Um...

21:35.772 --> 21:37.513
No.

21:37.557 --> 21:40.864
Every clue's more
cryptic than the last.

21:40.908 --> 21:42.039
You know, Moses
had the burning bush,

21:42.083 --> 21:44.738
but at least the bush talked.

21:44.781 --> 21:45.913
Hey.

21:45.956 --> 21:47.088
If you think
the Bible's part

21:47.131 --> 21:48.872
of your story, it probably is.

21:48.916 --> 21:53.703
We know that you have memories
from 1947 buried somewhere.

21:53.747 --> 21:55.444
Thankfully,

21:55.488 --> 21:57.751
I know just the right alien
to help dig it out.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.150
[Isobel sighs]

22:06.194 --> 22:08.718
[door closes]

22:08.762 --> 22:10.024
Hey.

22:11.068 --> 22:12.374
You're leaving?

22:13.419 --> 22:14.768
Yes.

22:14.811 --> 22:16.378
Dallas needs my help

22:16.422 --> 22:17.901
in Roswell.

22:17.945 --> 22:19.381
I don't know,
this got weird, right?

22:19.425 --> 22:20.469
And it-it doesn't have
to get weird.

22:20.513 --> 22:21.470
It's good, so...

22:21.514 --> 22:22.732
I'll see you back at home.

22:23.994 --> 22:25.387
U-Uh, you can't go.

22:27.781 --> 22:29.348
Look, the longer
I keep this inside,

22:29.391 --> 22:30.305
the harder it'll be
to tell you the truth.

22:32.176 --> 22:33.569
Keep what inside?

22:34.701 --> 22:37.399
Isobel Evans,
I am terrified of you.

22:39.401 --> 22:40.924
Oh.

22:40.968 --> 22:43.405
I-In ninth grade
I saw you make a girl cry

22:43.449 --> 22:45.755
because you complimented
her eyebrows.

22:45.799 --> 22:47.278
You know more ways

22:47.322 --> 22:49.237
to break an arm
than Ronda Rousey.

22:50.934 --> 22:55.156
And you dress like a Russian
spy undercover at Coachella.

22:55.199 --> 22:57.158
[laughs]

22:57.201 --> 23:01.858
But most of all, I am terrified

23:01.902 --> 23:04.557
that at any second
you would jump into my mind

23:04.600 --> 23:08.082
and discover you are
all I think about.

23:09.126 --> 23:10.824
And that you
will realize...

23:12.086 --> 23:13.435
...I'm in love with you.

23:13.479 --> 23:15.524
[exhales]

23:19.093 --> 23:20.529
Oh...

23:20.573 --> 23:23.532
I've wanted to tell you
for a long time,

23:23.576 --> 23:25.795
but I've always been afraid
of what you might say.

23:25.839 --> 23:29.408
Except now I realize
I'm even more afraid

23:29.451 --> 23:30.844
of never finding out at all.

23:32.062 --> 23:34.804
What if I don't know
what to say?

23:34.848 --> 23:37.198
Say it wasn't just a rebound.

23:37.241 --> 23:39.418
Say you felt it, too.

23:39.461 --> 23:40.767
Tell me I'm not crazy.

23:40.810 --> 23:42.856
Kyle, you're not.

23:44.379 --> 23:47.861
[exhales]
Wow, this is just, um...

23:47.904 --> 23:50.690
It's kind of a lot, you know,
I'm in the middle of this...

23:50.733 --> 23:54.476
breakup and... [grunts]
I'm trying to process.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.435
Right, okay. I-I understand.

23:57.697 --> 24:00.003
So say you need more time.

24:00.047 --> 24:02.049
Say you're not ready.

24:02.092 --> 24:04.443
I've gotten really good
at waiting. [chuckles]

24:05.879 --> 24:07.446
So ask me to wait.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.448
No, I-I can't ask you
to wait. I...

24:10.536 --> 24:14.061
Waiting implies expectations.

24:14.104 --> 24:16.672
And that terrifies
me because...

24:16.716 --> 24:20.415
what if I can't say the thing
that you want to hear?

24:22.417 --> 24:24.680
'Cause I can't do that
to somebody again.

24:24.724 --> 24:26.377
Kyle...

24:29.946 --> 24:32.209
...I can't afford to lose you.

24:34.298 --> 24:36.039
Really.

24:43.351 --> 24:45.745
I'll see you
back in Roswell, okay?

24:50.576 --> 24:51.881
[door opens]

24:56.059 --> 24:57.539
[sighs]

24:57.583 --> 24:59.019
You need to calm down, Michael.

24:59.062 --> 25:00.542
You're gonna make
yourself worse.

25:00.586 --> 25:02.065
I just want to make sure
that I understand

25:02.109 --> 25:03.589
Bonnie's genius plan.

25:03.632 --> 25:05.373
To protect me from Clyde,

25:05.416 --> 25:06.983
you took away
my greatest strength?

25:07.027 --> 25:08.419
Our abilities don't
make us strong.

25:08.463 --> 25:09.725
They're a sickness.

25:09.769 --> 25:11.031
[sneezes]

25:11.074 --> 25:12.511
[coughing]

25:12.554 --> 25:13.599
What do you even know
about being sick?

25:13.642 --> 25:15.426
My mother was a soldier

25:15.470 --> 25:16.819
in the Dictator's army.

25:16.863 --> 25:18.342
She wanted to bring peace
to Oasis,

25:18.386 --> 25:20.257
and every day,
when she left our home,

25:20.301 --> 25:22.608
I thought that was the last
time I was gonna see her.

25:22.651 --> 25:25.219
So one day I-I
begged her to stay.

25:25.262 --> 25:27.700
I held her, I cried,
I-I kissed her.

25:27.743 --> 25:29.832
You took away her powers.

25:29.876 --> 25:31.530
I didn't know
what I was capable of.

25:31.573 --> 25:33.575
And when she realized
what I had done, she was,

25:33.619 --> 25:35.359
she was furious with me.

25:35.403 --> 25:37.274
She kicked me out of my
own home. I was alone.

25:37.318 --> 25:39.015
Until I met Clyde.

25:39.059 --> 25:41.191
He was the one that brought me
in to Ophiuchus.

25:41.235 --> 25:43.629
Tezca said Jones was
a "collector of abilities."

25:43.672 --> 25:44.891
Is that what you did for him?

25:44.934 --> 25:46.414
No, uh-- no, I can't,

25:46.457 --> 25:48.634
I can't use the powers I take.

25:48.677 --> 25:50.026
But that didn't stop him
from using me

25:50.070 --> 25:51.593
to neutralize his enemies.

25:51.637 --> 25:54.465
I wanted to bring
peace to Oasis.

25:54.509 --> 25:56.511
I-I thought that if...

25:56.555 --> 26:00.254
that if I could just show
my mother, I can make her proud.

26:00.297 --> 26:02.909
I was brainwashed, but
this planet, it opened my eyes.

26:02.952 --> 26:04.998
And-and when I kissed you,
Michael, I thought

26:05.041 --> 26:07.304
that I had finally done
something good with my power.

26:07.348 --> 26:09.480
You want to do something good?

26:09.524 --> 26:11.439
Give me my powers back.

26:13.093 --> 26:15.486
I can't.

26:15.530 --> 26:17.706
I'm sorry.
There's no reversing it.

26:17.750 --> 26:19.578
[door opens]

26:20.796 --> 26:22.363
Station's closed.

26:22.406 --> 26:24.321
[door closes]

26:24.365 --> 26:25.584
It's her.

26:36.682 --> 26:38.118
Hello, Sheriff.

26:39.336 --> 26:40.555
I'm here for that prisoner.

26:49.303 --> 26:51.653
Still reaching for that
primitive weapon, I see.

26:51.697 --> 26:53.829
No use risking
another outburst.

26:53.873 --> 26:55.091
I only want her.

26:55.135 --> 26:56.223
MAX:
You're lying.

26:56.266 --> 26:57.964
You ordered her to kill Michael.

26:58.007 --> 26:59.705
I'm sorry, what now?

26:59.748 --> 27:02.098
TEZCA:
Killing him was a test
Bonnie failed.

27:02.142 --> 27:04.753
Let's see how chatty she is
after I cut out her tongue.

27:04.797 --> 27:06.755
Get Bonnie out of here.

27:07.843 --> 27:09.497
[grunts]

27:11.455 --> 27:13.849
Why must I do everything myself?

27:14.937 --> 27:16.547
Bonnie, run.

27:19.333 --> 27:20.421
TEZCA:
You always were a fool.

27:20.464 --> 27:22.162
So easily seduced.

27:22.205 --> 27:23.859
Stay back.

27:27.210 --> 27:28.777
In all my years,

27:28.821 --> 27:31.519
I've never encountered
a student as stubborn as you.

27:31.562 --> 27:33.608
We both know how this ends.

27:38.700 --> 27:39.962
Michael?

27:40.006 --> 27:41.311
Michael.

27:41.355 --> 27:43.052
Talk to me. Are you okay?

27:43.096 --> 27:44.924
Why are we out here?
I need to help Max.

27:44.967 --> 27:46.708
No, no, no, no. You
can't go back in there.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.710
Tezca doesn't care
if you live or die.

27:48.754 --> 27:50.843
Oh, yeah? Like you do?

27:50.886 --> 27:52.496
[metal clinks]

27:54.455 --> 27:57.458
How do you keep finding new ways
to take me out of the fight?

27:57.501 --> 27:59.286
I've gotten really good
at stealing on this planet.

27:59.329 --> 28:00.722
And if I'm gonna
stay here,

28:00.766 --> 28:01.941
you're the only friend I have.

28:01.984 --> 28:03.682
Friends don't handcuff friends.

28:03.725 --> 28:06.119
They don't kiss away
their powers without asking!

28:06.162 --> 28:07.990
I might have been wrong
to take away your powers,

28:08.034 --> 28:10.689
but if I let you run back inside
and play the powerless hero,

28:10.732 --> 28:12.473
it's gonna be my fault you died.

28:15.171 --> 28:16.912
TEZCA:
I'm impressed.

28:16.956 --> 28:18.697
You're already improving.

28:18.740 --> 28:21.438
Controlling your anger.What do you want with me?

28:21.482 --> 28:23.005
Bonnie said Liz and I hold
the pieces together.

28:23.049 --> 28:24.224
What does that mean?

28:24.267 --> 28:25.747
It means Bonnie talks too much.

28:25.791 --> 28:26.835
And you don't talk enough.

28:26.879 --> 28:28.402
[groans]

28:29.403 --> 28:31.666
What is the alighting?

28:31.710 --> 28:33.842
A lesson for another time,
perhaps.

28:37.759 --> 28:39.108
[grunts]

28:43.634 --> 28:45.332
LIZ:
Because of
the handprint,

28:45.375 --> 28:47.116
I could sense
you needed some help.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.205
And since I know you've
been running hot lately,

28:49.249 --> 28:50.772
I phoned a friend.

28:50.816 --> 28:51.686
I'll grab the
fire extinguisher.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.166
No, I got this.

28:55.124 --> 28:56.430
[gasps]

28:57.561 --> 28:58.780
[both sigh]

29:00.434 --> 29:02.262
Was that your dad's machete?

29:02.305 --> 29:03.698
I told him you insulted
his cooking

29:03.742 --> 29:05.308
and he loaned it to me
right away.

29:05.352 --> 29:07.571
Oh. Didn't realize I was
dating an action hero.

29:07.615 --> 29:08.834
Uh, Sarah Connor?

29:09.399 --> 29:12.272
I think we might have
just found our Terminator.

29:18.191 --> 29:19.714
[clatters]

29:21.803 --> 29:23.413
Cute.

29:23.457 --> 29:26.199
But no match
for my superior genetics.

29:27.156 --> 29:28.854
You must be
Theo's son.

29:28.897 --> 29:30.464
Just like your father,

29:30.507 --> 29:32.814
putting your faith
in a human like her

29:32.858 --> 29:35.077
when you should put
your faith in Ophiuchus.

29:35.121 --> 29:36.818
Hey, I don't want to get all
"in this house" on you,

29:36.862 --> 29:39.952
but a human like me puts
her faith in science.

29:41.475 --> 29:44.695
Which is why I tipped
that machete in Bonnie's virus.

29:44.739 --> 29:46.828
Then I added
a chemical accelerant

29:46.872 --> 29:48.351
to speed things up a little bit.

29:49.700 --> 29:50.919
I've been studying

29:50.963 --> 29:52.791
your superior genetics.

29:52.834 --> 29:55.228
And judging by the fresh ink
on your arms,

29:55.271 --> 29:57.360
I think we're about
to meet what's really written

29:57.404 --> 29:58.361
in your DNA.

29:58.405 --> 29:59.841
Your true form.

30:06.108 --> 30:08.241
Your theory was right.

30:08.284 --> 30:11.113
But my Savior
was right, too.

30:11.157 --> 30:14.987
Miracles present themselves
to those who are patient.

30:15.030 --> 30:16.249
What are you getting at?

30:16.292 --> 30:18.425
[rattling]

30:18.468 --> 30:19.861
That, together,

30:19.905 --> 30:21.471
you two will change

30:21.515 --> 30:22.646
both our worlds.

30:29.262 --> 30:32.569
Well, Tezca fled,
but at least we're alive.

30:32.613 --> 30:34.397
I'm so glad you're okay.

30:34.441 --> 30:36.138
Well, that is thanks
to my two partners.

30:36.182 --> 30:37.357
[laughs]

30:37.400 --> 30:38.619
Oh, God.

30:38.662 --> 30:40.099
Well, at least one of us
survived.

30:40.142 --> 30:42.275
He's tougher than he looks.Ooh.

30:42.318 --> 30:44.407
You know, after all the threats
Arturo made, I figured

30:44.451 --> 30:46.975
I would be the one skewered
on the end of that machete.

30:47.019 --> 30:49.673
But it was pretty sexy
