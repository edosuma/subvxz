40:20.917 --> 40:22.125
I mean, it doesn't
move us forward.

40:22.125 --> 40:24.208
We're in the same place
we were 3 months ago.

40:24.792 --> 40:26.417
It's time to grow up, Dawson.

40:26.417 --> 40:28.917
I know, Joey.
We can.

40:29.750 --> 40:31.792
-We are growing up.
-No, we're not.

40:32.166 --> 40:33.750
Every day is the same.

40:33.750 --> 40:35.917
We watch a movie,
preferably a Spielberg film,

40:35.917 --> 40:37.375
find the appropriate
life correlation.

40:37.375 --> 40:38.708
Then we pat
ourselves on the back

40:38.708 --> 40:39.708
for being so clever.

40:40.125 --> 40:42.583
You know, and as much
as our perception is dead-on,

40:42.583 --> 40:45.083
our honesty
is severely lacking, Dawson.

40:45.500 --> 40:46.959
There is something lacking.

40:49.917 --> 40:51.417
And the reason
I came here tonight

40:51.417 --> 40:53.667
is because
we need to move on.

40:54.417 --> 40:56.250
Look, we're
not kids anymore,

40:56.750 --> 40:58.250
and I'm not gonna
do this anymore,

40:58.250 --> 41:00.083
and I just thought
you should know, so...

41:00.542 --> 41:02.708
So, are you going to France?

41:04.041 --> 41:06.166
Ah, the inevitable
cliffhanger:

41:06.458 --> 41:08.000
am I going to France?

41:09.792 --> 41:10.834
Are you?

41:11.834 --> 41:13.917
Look, I am tired of all
the drama in my life

41:13.917 --> 41:15.750
right now, Dawson,
and-- and leaving town

41:15.750 --> 41:17.291
just makes the most sense
to me, so--

41:17.291 --> 41:18.333
No, it doesn't.

41:18.959 --> 41:20.125
Why should I stay?

41:20.542 --> 41:22.458
Is there some new release
at the video store

41:22.458 --> 41:23.792
I don't know about?

41:24.708 --> 41:26.458
It's time to grow up, Dawson.

41:26.917 --> 41:28.458
Well, then we'll
do it together.

41:29.208 --> 41:31.250
Joey, I can grow up.
Give me a chance.

41:31.667 --> 41:33.959
Even Spielberg outgrew
his Peter-Pan syndrome.

41:34.708 --> 41:37.125
I could have told you that
months ago, Dawson.

41:37.708 --> 41:38.792
You did.

41:47.417 --> 41:48.667
Yeah.

41:53.417 --> 41:55.291
[SIGHS]
Look, Dawson...

41:56.333 --> 42:00.291
I am so tired of dancing
around these big words.

42:01.917 --> 42:05.125
You know, I-- I just
want to be honest with you.

42:05.667 --> 42:06.750
Me, too.

42:08.208 --> 42:10.834
Joe, more than anything,
I just want to be honest.

42:12.625 --> 42:14.625
Do you think we're ready
for that honesty?

42:16.667 --> 42:17.875
Yeah.

42:19.875 --> 42:21.166
I do.

42:24.375 --> 42:25.750
Are you sure...

42:26.834 --> 42:29.166
Because honesty
is a big word, and...

42:29.708 --> 42:31.083
It changes things,

42:31.417 --> 42:33.625
and it complicates things.
It...

42:35.291 --> 42:36.875
Are you sure you're
ready for everything

42:36.875 --> 42:38.834
that goes along
with telling the truth?
