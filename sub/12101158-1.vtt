00:01.260 --> 00:03.927
(ominous music)

00:10.314 --> 00:15.314
(heart beating)
(suspenseful music)

00:23.965 --> 00:26.715
(birds chirping)

00:27.620 --> 00:29.775
- Run!
(girls screaming)

00:29.775 --> 00:33.195
Tag me, tag me!
(whimsical music)

00:33.195 --> 00:34.028
- Mom!

00:34.028 --> 00:36.945
(distant laughter)

00:39.247 --> 00:40.330
- [Boy] Dad!

00:51.957 --> 00:52.790
- Very good.

00:52.790 --> 00:54.680
You wanna learn a trick?

00:54.680 --> 00:55.513
- Yeah.

00:55.513 --> 00:56.660
- Put your pencil down.

00:56.660 --> 00:58.360
I'm gonna teach you how to
do it in your head, okay?

00:58.360 --> 00:59.193
It's faster.

01:00.100 --> 01:02.856
Now, what's 200 plus 100?

01:02.856 --> 01:03.689
- 300.

01:03.689 --> 01:04.832
- Good, 300 plus 10.

01:04.832 --> 01:05.665
- 310.

01:05.665 --> 01:06.770
- Plus 30.

01:06.770 --> 01:07.603
- 340.

01:07.603 --> 01:08.436
- Plus three.

01:08.436 --> 01:09.269
- 343.

01:09.269 --> 01:10.102
- Plus five.

01:10.102 --> 01:12.050
- 348.

01:12.050 --> 01:13.267
- You got it.

01:13.267 --> 01:15.186
And if you multiply them?

01:15.186 --> 01:17.063
28,755.

01:19.210 --> 01:20.310
Keep working, big guy.

01:21.230 --> 01:25.318
(peaceful music)
(birds chirping)

01:25.318 --> 01:26.197
- Are you sure you don't
want me to take her?

01:26.197 --> 01:28.500
- You kidding? You always get to take her.

01:28.500 --> 01:29.464
- [Mom] Good luck, Charlotte.

01:29.464 --> 01:30.297
- Bye!

01:30.297 --> 01:31.757
- Come on, you gonna score a goal?

01:31.757 --> 01:32.590
- [Scarlett] Yeah!

01:32.590 --> 01:34.260
- All right!

01:34.260 --> 01:35.203
Hurry up, Peter.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.413
Whoa, comb that yourself?

01:39.882 --> 01:42.686
(chuckles) You look so handsome.

01:42.686 --> 01:45.126
(upbeat music)

01:45.126 --> 01:46.019
Come on, sweetie!

01:46.019 --> 01:46.852
Come on, come on!

01:46.852 --> 01:48.685
We're late, let's go!

01:56.593 --> 01:59.833
All right, who wants a hot dog?

02:02.440 --> 02:03.620
- Are we gonna have movie night?

02:03.620 --> 02:05.050
- Ooh, with popcorn?

02:05.050 --> 02:05.920
- Please?

02:05.920 --> 02:06.980
- Please?

02:06.980 --> 02:08.030
- After your baths.

02:08.030 --> 02:08.863
Go on up.

02:09.710 --> 02:10.773
I'll be right there.

02:12.817 --> 02:15.317
(Jimmy sighs)

02:16.630 --> 02:17.463
- Oh.

02:19.337 --> 02:21.087
Here you go, sweetie.

02:23.512 --> 02:25.594
Oh no.

02:25.594 --> 02:26.427
- [Tracy] Hm?

02:26.427 --> 02:30.733
- Jane's been calling,
texting, sending smoke signals.

02:32.340 --> 02:34.163
I'll meet you up there.

02:34.163 --> 02:36.746
(somber music)

02:43.912 --> 02:46.912
(dishes clattering)

02:48.530 --> 02:51.330
Hey, sorry, I forgot to turn
the ringer on after church.

02:52.470 --> 02:54.677
No, no problem. I'll
put it together tonight.

02:54.677 --> 02:56.223
Everything's fine.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.353
Okay, boardroom at seven.

02:59.353 --> 03:00.683
All right, bye.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.143
Okay, hon, start the movie without me!

03:11.224 --> 03:14.290
(traffic roaring)

03:14.290 --> 03:16.040
- [Jane] 26 million sounds low.

03:16.040 --> 03:17.070
- Oh, that's just the base case.

03:17.070 --> 03:18.550
I'll run the high and the low today.

03:18.550 --> 03:20.930
- Can you get the high up to 40 million?

03:20.930 --> 03:22.197
- 40?

03:22.197 --> 03:24.520
- That's what Mark's gonna wanna see.

03:24.520 --> 03:26.363
- That's gonna be tough.

03:28.075 --> 03:30.325
- (sighs) What if we
close the Manila office?

03:31.260 --> 03:32.760
- What, and cover it in India?

03:34.160 --> 03:35.530
It's just gonna end up costing us more.

03:35.530 --> 03:37.010
We'd be better off moving India there,

03:37.010 --> 03:38.600
and just taking a restructuring charge.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.830
- Can you show it both ways?

03:40.830 --> 03:41.663
- I'm not sure we wanna close any--

03:41.663 --> 03:43.240
- Just run it both ways, please.

03:43.240 --> 03:44.160
- Okay.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.920
- And can you do a call with him tonight,

03:45.920 --> 03:47.440
nine p.m. our time?

03:47.440 --> 03:48.360
- Sure.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.660
- You'll be ready to present
to the board on Friday?

03:50.660 --> 03:51.660
- If you need me to.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.943
- I'm not presenting it.
(phone ringing)

04:03.820 --> 04:04.810
- [Jimmy] Hey.

04:04.810 --> 04:05.643
- [Tracy] How was it?

04:05.643 --> 04:06.820
- Well, it was fine.

04:06.820 --> 04:07.740
Thank you.
- Mhm.

04:10.092 --> 04:11.100
- The kids asleep?

04:11.100 --> 04:12.740
- They should be, but you can peek in.

04:12.740 --> 04:14.180
- No, I gotta hop on with the Philippines

04:14.180 --> 04:15.430
in like five minutes.

04:15.430 --> 04:17.290
- I thought that was on Wednesdays?

04:17.290 --> 04:19.370
- No, might be everyday this week.

04:19.370 --> 04:22.010
- Okay, well, Scarlett's
parent-teacher is on Thursday,

04:22.010 --> 04:23.310
so can you be home by six?

04:24.150 --> 04:25.140
- No.

04:25.140 --> 04:28.120
- Okay, I'll just drop
Peter off with Liz then.

04:28.120 --> 04:29.350
- Oh, I'm sorry.

04:29.350 --> 04:32.490
Mm, it's just crazy right now.

04:32.490 --> 04:33.323
- When isn't it?

04:36.311 --> 04:39.061
(birds chirping)

04:48.738 --> 04:51.238
(Jimmy sighs)

04:55.610 --> 04:58.193
(Jimmy grunts)

05:09.730 --> 05:12.050
- Still can't pop that bus
that's growing out of my neck.

05:12.050 --> 05:13.520
- Call your doctor.

05:13.520 --> 05:15.320
- Ah, I'll call him next
week if it doesn't go away.

05:15.320 --> 05:16.430
- You said that last week.

05:16.430 --> 05:17.263
You know, a two minute call

05:17.263 --> 05:18.940
would save you two months of worrying.

05:18.940 --> 05:21.500
- All right, give the kids a kiss for me.

05:21.500 --> 05:25.080
Oh, tell them we'll go to that
jumping place this weekend.

05:25.080 --> 05:25.913
See you tonight.

05:25.913 --> 05:27.583
- Good luck with the board.
- Thank you.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.630
- [Doctor] When did you first see it?

05:34.630 --> 05:36.280
- Uh, maybe like three weeks ago.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.100
- [Doctor] And how large
was it at the beginning?

05:38.100 --> 05:40.034
- Uh, I don't know, small.

05:40.034 --> 05:41.860
- [Doctor] Like a pea?

05:41.860 --> 05:43.730
- Uh, yeah, probably.

05:43.730 --> 05:44.578
- [Doctor] And how big is it now?

05:44.578 --> 05:45.850
(bell rings)

05:45.850 --> 05:48.450
- Uh, maybe twice as big.

05:48.450 --> 05:49.650
- [Doctor] Like a grape?

05:51.210 --> 05:52.803
- Ah, yeah, like a grape.

05:55.275 --> 05:56.520
(phone whooshing)

05:56.520 --> 05:58.168
Now you got me craving a salad.

05:58.168 --> 06:01.920
- (chuckles) Well, it sounds like a cyst.

06:01.920 --> 06:03.817
Nothing to worry about.

06:03.817 --> 06:05.220
- [Jimmy] Will it go away?

06:05.220 --> 06:06.053
- It might.

06:06.053 --> 06:07.870
- [Jimmy] Well, I want it to.

06:07.870 --> 06:09.020
- Well, make an appointment,

06:09.020 --> 06:11.420
and I'll take it out, it's simple.

06:11.420 --> 06:12.820
- Okay, I'll see you then.

06:12.820 --> 06:13.653
- [Doctor] Bye.

06:13.653 --> 06:14.489
- Bye.

06:14.489 --> 06:16.440
(bell ringing)

06:16.440 --> 06:18.793
Oh, you are killing me.

06:23.020 --> 06:25.850
- Jane, are you saying the, uh...

06:25.850 --> 06:26.980
What is it?

06:26.980 --> 06:30.250
15 million or so, is coming from revenue

06:30.250 --> 06:32.420
or from deal synergies?

06:32.420 --> 06:35.000
- It's mostly labor offsets.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.173
We were modeling combining
India and the Philippines.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.730
- You have both locations
listed in the appendix.

06:41.730 --> 06:42.653
Is that incorrect?

06:46.550 --> 06:49.130
- Uh, it's actually a little bit of both.

06:49.130 --> 06:51.730
If we just go back one page.

06:51.730 --> 06:53.910
On the high P and L,
you'll see that the revenue

06:53.910 --> 06:57.877
is modeled at 13% higher with
a $3 million drop in SGNA,

06:57.877 --> 07:01.480
and that's a $4 million labor
drop-off through attrition

07:01.480 --> 07:03.830
offset by $1 million in ad spend.

07:03.830 --> 07:06.550
- So, no overseas offices close.

07:06.550 --> 07:08.283
- No, no, we discussed that.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.110
It's bad optics,

07:11.110 --> 07:13.810
considering how much business
we do in both countries.

07:15.030 --> 07:15.863
- Jim, what do you think about

07:15.863 --> 07:17.493
the 40 million on the high case?

07:20.520 --> 07:21.470
- Uh...

07:24.890 --> 07:25.923
It's ambitious.

07:27.410 --> 07:29.950
If we do everything
perfectly, it's got a chance,

07:29.950 --> 07:31.970
but I think 35 is a good stretch target.

07:31.970 --> 07:33.520
The Street would like that too.

07:35.120 --> 07:38.083
- Mark, can you sign up for 35?

07:40.640 --> 07:41.690
- I'm fine with that.

07:45.353 --> 07:46.460
- All right.

07:46.460 --> 07:48.050
You got the green light.

07:48.050 --> 07:49.400
- Thank you.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.050
We'll announce it Monday morning.

07:52.930 --> 07:55.543
- Jane, swing by my office please.

08:06.033 --> 08:09.023
(phone ringing)

08:09.023 --> 08:10.080
- Hey, Jane.

08:10.080 --> 08:12.820
- [Jane] Mark just crucified
me for not knowing the numbers.

08:12.820 --> 08:14.300
I want to block off an hour with you

08:14.300 --> 08:15.710
first thing everyday next week,

08:15.710 --> 08:18.150
so you can walk me through the details.

08:18.150 --> 08:21.000
- Okay, I've just got a doctor's
appointment Friday morning.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.923
- [Jane] Can you move it to the afternoon?

08:24.494 --> 08:27.540
- Yeah, let me see what I can do.

08:27.540 --> 08:28.373
- [Jane] Thanks.

08:28.373 --> 08:29.206
- Okay.

08:29.206 --> 08:32.272
(somber music)

08:32.272 --> 08:34.004
(birds chirping)

08:34.004 --> 08:36.754
(car door slams)

08:47.300 --> 08:48.250
- Yeah, it's a cyst.

08:48.250 --> 08:50.230
You want me to remove it?

08:50.230 --> 08:51.063
- Right here?

08:51.063 --> 08:51.896
- Sure, quick shot of
Novocaine. Small incision.

08:51.896 --> 08:54.970
It takes five minutes.

08:54.970 --> 08:55.970
- Okay. Let's do it.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.360
- We'll just give it a minute to sink in.

09:06.710 --> 09:08.410
How's Tracy?

09:08.410 --> 09:09.470
- She's good.

09:09.470 --> 09:10.380
Yeah. We're all good.

09:10.380 --> 09:11.830
How about you?

09:11.830 --> 09:13.400
- No complaints.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.030
You guys have any vacation plans?

09:15.030 --> 09:16.513
- Oh, what are those?

09:17.850 --> 09:20.993
- All right, now lean forward a little.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.170
You won't even feel this.

09:24.170 --> 09:25.003
- Okay.

09:34.090 --> 09:35.540
- Jimmy, it's not cyst.

09:35.540 --> 09:37.490
I just need to cut underneath it a bit.

09:38.360 --> 09:39.714
- What is it?

09:39.714 --> 09:42.240
- Just some dead tissue probably.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.660
Now, there's not a lot of Novocain,

09:43.660 --> 09:45.800
so you might feel this, okay?

09:45.800 --> 09:47.401
- Okay.

09:47.401 --> 09:49.140
Wow. I can definitely feel that.

09:49.140 --> 09:51.000
- Sorry, just sit tight.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.050
I just want to make sure I get all of it.

09:56.552 --> 09:58.552
Okay. That should be it.

09:59.950 --> 10:00.783
Tweezers.

10:09.200 --> 10:12.100
Okay, this incision is a little
deeper than I anticipated.

10:12.100 --> 10:13.563
I need to cauterize it, okay?

10:15.025 --> 10:16.870
- You wanna give me a
little Novocaine first?

10:16.870 --> 10:19.610
- That won't do anything at this point.

10:19.610 --> 10:20.443
- Okay.

10:22.270 --> 10:23.320
- You ready?
- Yeah.

10:24.361 --> 10:27.710
(Jimmy groaning)

10:27.710 --> 10:30.050
- Okay, that's it.

10:30.050 --> 10:32.450
Now, I'm just going to close you up

10:32.450 --> 10:35.597
and I will send it to the lab

10:35.597 --> 10:37.644
and let you know what comes back.

10:37.644 --> 10:39.350
- You don't think it's
anything to worry about, right?

10:39.350 --> 10:40.700
- No. Don't worry about it.

10:44.300 --> 10:45.790
- [Man] Tommy!

10:45.790 --> 10:46.623
- [Boy] Coach!

10:51.401 --> 10:54.068
(phone ringing)

10:55.380 --> 10:56.213
- Nicole Allen?

10:57.145 --> 10:58.563
- Oh, it's Dr. Allen.

10:58.563 --> 11:00.146
- [Coach] Go short!

11:03.780 --> 11:04.640
- This is Jim.

11:04.640 --> 11:05.473
- Hi, Jim.

11:05.473 --> 11:07.010
- [Doctor] Hi, Jim. It's Dr. Allen.

11:07.010 --> 11:08.340
Sorry to call you on the weekend.

11:08.340 --> 11:09.370
- Oh no, no problem, Dr. Allen.

11:09.370 --> 11:10.203
What's up?

11:13.390 --> 11:15.940
- [Doctor] We got preliminary
results from the lab.

11:18.530 --> 11:20.061
- Okay.

11:20.061 --> 11:22.063
- [Doctor] Jim, it's lymphoma.

11:24.830 --> 11:27.033
That's a cancer of your white blood cells.

11:30.186 --> 11:31.019
- Uh...

11:32.493 --> 11:35.660
I'm sorry. I thought you
said it was just dead tissue.

11:35.660 --> 11:37.460
- [Doctor] That's what I was hoping.

11:39.440 --> 11:41.963
We need to get you a CAT
scan as soon as possible.

11:44.340 --> 11:46.700
- You think it might be in other places?

11:46.700 --> 11:49.220
- [Doctor] We won't know
until we do the scan,

11:49.220 --> 11:52.630
but to be candid, having
it reach your skin

11:52.630 --> 11:54.580
likely means it started somewhere else.

11:58.167 --> 12:00.633
- Oh, like where?

12:02.030 --> 12:05.160
- [Doctor] Where there's a
concentration of lymph nodes.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.653
Your arm pits, breast bone.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.783
You're likely at an advanced state.

12:15.255 --> 12:16.088
- What?

12:18.021 --> 12:20.670
What does that mean?

12:20.670 --> 12:22.770
- We need to prepare for the worst, Jimmy.

12:24.699 --> 12:29.699
I'm sorry.
(somber music)

12:42.450 --> 12:46.680
- Well, let's just see
what the scans say, okay?

12:46.680 --> 12:47.513
- Yeah.

12:48.590 --> 12:49.697
- Stay positive.

12:49.697 --> 12:51.660
- I know.

12:51.660 --> 12:52.720
I know, I know.

12:52.720 --> 12:53.680
I'm going to be fine.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.403
It's going to be fine.

12:58.650 --> 13:00.188
I'm just gonna go check on 'em.

13:00.188 --> 13:01.021
- Okay.
- Okay?

13:01.021 --> 13:01.938
- No watch.

13:07.829 --> 13:10.412
(somber music)

13:59.526 --> 14:04.526
(traffic distantly roaring)
(birds chirping)

14:05.071 --> 14:06.200
(machine whirring)

14:06.200 --> 14:07.290
- [Technician] No watch?

14:07.290 --> 14:08.123
- Nope.

14:08.123 --> 14:08.956
- [Technician] Keys?

14:08.956 --> 14:09.789
- Nope.

14:09.789 --> 14:11.170
- [Technician] Any jewelry?

14:11.170 --> 14:12.430
- Not now.

14:12.430 --> 14:14.223
- [Technician] Okay. Jump right on.

14:20.430 --> 14:23.347
(machine whirring)

14:25.982 --> 14:27.320
- That wasn't so bad.

14:27.320 --> 14:28.770
- This was easy.

14:28.770 --> 14:31.040
Your PET scans and your bone marrow tests,

14:31.040 --> 14:32.313
those are not pleasant.

14:33.770 --> 14:34.997
What if this comes back negative?

14:34.997 --> 14:35.830
No, no.

14:35.830 --> 14:36.663
This would only show the traumas.

14:36.663 --> 14:39.750
The other tests will give
the doctors much more detail.

14:39.750 --> 14:42.020
You'll be able to see
everything in your body.

14:42.020 --> 14:44.533
- Oh, when do you think
you'll have the results?

14:45.510 --> 14:46.343
- Monday.

14:47.700 --> 14:49.383
- Do you think it's going to show tumors?

14:54.750 --> 14:55.583
- All right.

14:56.450 --> 14:57.920
- All right, all right. Take care.

14:57.920 --> 14:58.820
- [Jimmy] You too.

15:01.125 --> 15:04.292
(somber church music)

15:07.940 --> 15:09.190
- Okay, father.

15:39.646 --> 15:41.050
I ask that you take these prayers

15:41.050 --> 15:43.410
to your father who holds the world

15:43.410 --> 15:44.843
in the palm of his hand.

15:46.430 --> 15:49.053
Through him, all things are possible.

15:59.470 --> 16:02.173
Please just let me know
this will be all right.

16:06.392 --> 16:07.353
Hey.

16:07.353 --> 16:08.930
- Everything okay?

16:08.930 --> 16:11.230
- Yeah, just stayed and had a little

16:11.230 --> 16:12.673
heart-to-heart with the big guy.

16:14.770 --> 16:16.380
- Are you okay if I go
to the grocery store?

16:16.380 --> 16:17.213
- Yeah, of course.

16:17.213 --> 16:18.354
- The kids are playing downstairs.

16:18.354 --> 16:19.187
- Okay.

16:22.270 --> 16:23.103
Bye-bye.
- Bye.

16:38.705 --> 16:39.855
(glass cracks)
- Whoa!

16:42.240 --> 16:44.907
(ominous music)

17:10.440 --> 17:11.870
- The press have been great.

17:11.870 --> 17:13.600
- [Director] Do we have
any retention risk?

17:13.600 --> 17:16.006
- [Man] No, no. They like the deal too.

17:16.006 --> 17:18.673
(heart beating)

17:26.850 --> 17:29.880
- Jimmy, can you put an outline

17:29.880 --> 17:31.580
of the comms plan together for me?

17:32.500 --> 17:34.200
- Sure. Yeah, no problem.

17:34.200 --> 17:35.183
- [Director] Thank you.

17:39.024 --> 17:40.510
Well, good to go.

17:40.510 --> 17:44.029
Let's do a call next week
on the integration strategy.

17:44.029 --> 17:45.460
It's in good shape, Mark.

17:45.460 --> 17:46.955
- [Mark] Thanks.

17:46.955 --> 17:51.955
(heart beating)
(gentle music)

17:52.720 --> 17:54.827
- Nice reflexes. Thank you.

18:03.990 --> 18:06.657
(phone buzzing)

18:14.557 --> 18:15.640
- Oh, please.

18:19.510 --> 18:20.740
- Hey, Dr. Allen.

18:20.740 --> 18:22.890
- [Doctor] Hi, Jimmy,
are you sitting down?

18:23.759 --> 18:24.592
- Uh...

18:26.401 --> 18:27.720
Yeah, I am now.

18:27.720 --> 18:29.116
- Your scan came back negative.

18:29.116 --> 18:32.223
(Dr. Allen squealing)

18:32.223 --> 18:33.723
- Are you kidding me?

18:34.800 --> 18:36.530
- We're not out of the woods yet,

18:36.530 --> 18:39.610
but this is a very, very good sign, Jim.

18:39.610 --> 18:40.823
Very encouraging.

18:43.330 --> 18:44.660
- Uh, thank you.

18:44.660 --> 18:46.316
Thank you so much.

18:46.316 --> 18:47.274
- [Dr. Allen] Bye.

18:47.274 --> 18:50.442
(upbeat music)

18:50.442 --> 18:52.775
(Jim sighs)

18:54.591 --> 18:56.110
- [Kids] Daddy!

18:56.110 --> 18:57.696
- Look what I got!

18:57.696 --> 18:58.900
- Can we eat them now?

18:58.900 --> 18:59.733
- After dinner.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.550
- You guys keep eating.

19:02.550 --> 19:04.323
I gotta talk to Mommy real fast.

19:21.730 --> 19:22.930
They came back negative.

19:24.654 --> 19:26.152
- Oh, thank God.

19:26.152 --> 19:27.650
- I still have to do more tests,

19:27.650 --> 19:29.073
but you know, this is good.

19:30.950 --> 19:34.440
And, honey, I'm done
stressing about stuff.

19:34.440 --> 19:38.733
Nothing really matters, except
things that really matter.

19:40.540 --> 19:43.200
- So, this is the new you,

19:43.200 --> 19:44.369
being home in time for dinner?

19:44.369 --> 19:46.693
- Well, let's not get crazy.

19:51.278 --> 19:52.111
Come on.

19:56.290 --> 19:57.123
Oh.

19:57.123 --> 19:59.117
- [Tracy] So much for after dinner. Hm.

20:00.920 --> 20:02.023
- Well, well.

20:03.486 --> 20:04.410
Is it good?

20:04.410 --> 20:05.780
No, I could have it done
by the end of today.

20:05.780 --> 20:07.532
- Mr. Valentino?

20:07.532 --> 20:08.840
- They're calling me in now.

20:08.840 --> 20:09.860
I gotta go.

20:09.860 --> 20:11.270
Okay, okay. Talk to him.

20:11.270 --> 20:12.103
Okay, bye.

20:13.160 --> 20:14.080
Okay.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.400
- Good luck.

20:15.400 --> 20:16.920
Be strong.

20:16.920 --> 20:19.280
- Mrs. Valentino, you can
come too if you'd like.

20:19.280 --> 20:20.113
- Do you mind?

20:20.113 --> 20:20.946
- Yeah.
- Okay.

20:24.208 --> 20:26.541
(Jim sighs)

20:27.800 --> 20:29.190
- You ready?

20:29.190 --> 20:30.260
- Mhm.

20:30.260 --> 20:32.920
Okay, now, it's going
to feel uncomfortable

20:32.920 --> 20:34.280
while I get the sample,

20:34.280 --> 20:37.220
and then when I aspirate the marrow,

20:37.220 --> 20:39.540
you're going to feel some pain, all right?

20:39.540 --> 20:40.640
- Okay.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.170
- You holding his hand?

20:42.170 --> 20:43.620
Good. Okay.

20:43.620 --> 20:44.880
Here we go.

20:44.880 --> 20:47.297
(Jim grunts)

20:48.370 --> 20:50.953
(Jim groaning)

20:53.770 --> 20:55.090
You're doing great.

20:55.090 --> 20:56.173
Almost done here.

20:57.555 --> 21:00.055
(Tracy sighs)

21:02.020 --> 21:05.066
I'm going to aspirate, now.

21:05.066 --> 21:07.483
(Jim groans)

21:12.060 --> 21:13.700
Great.

21:13.700 --> 21:15.937
You did just great, Jimmy.

21:15.937 --> 21:17.280
(Jim sighs)

21:17.280 --> 21:18.133
- I'm sorry.

21:20.069 --> 21:21.420
- Thank you.

21:21.420 --> 21:23.817
(phone buzzes)

21:23.817 --> 21:24.883
Oh, it's Jane.

21:26.393 --> 21:29.563
- Does it really matter?
(phone buzzing)

21:36.280 --> 21:39.453
- Mr. Valentino, we're
ready for your PET scan.

21:43.820 --> 21:46.550
I'm sorry, Mrs. Valentino.
No one else is admitted.

21:46.550 --> 21:47.823
- Oh, okay.

21:49.210 --> 21:50.043
Good luck.

21:50.043 --> 21:51.153
- Okay.
- Be strong.

22:03.920 --> 22:06.716
- That bone marrow test is no joke, right?

22:06.716 --> 22:08.078
- You weren't lying.

22:08.078 --> 22:12.663
- All right, let's get
this taken care of, then.

22:23.250 --> 22:24.083
- What is that?

22:25.260 --> 22:26.973
- That's nuclear medicine.

22:28.010 --> 22:30.510
- What are you planning to do with it?

22:30.510 --> 22:32.340
- That goes into the IV.

22:32.340 --> 22:34.040
We light it up on the scan and we can see

22:34.040 --> 22:36.330
all the malignant cells
in your entire body.

22:36.330 --> 22:37.830
Do you travel often?

22:37.830 --> 22:39.810
- Yeah. Yeah, I do for work.

22:46.820 --> 22:48.303
I'm going to be radioactive?

22:49.617 --> 22:51.110
- You'll have to stay away from children

22:51.110 --> 22:53.500
and pregnant women for a few days.

22:53.500 --> 22:55.163
Lucky, lucky man.

23:01.250 --> 23:02.966
- So what are the next steps?

23:02.966 --> 23:04.510
- Depending on what they show us,

23:04.510 --> 23:06.070
they said she may need three or four

23:06.070 --> 23:07.743
more procedures or tests.

23:07.743 --> 23:09.980
- We'll send the results to Dr. Allen.

23:09.980 --> 23:10.880
- Okay, thank you.

23:11.780 --> 23:12.613
- Angela.

23:13.730 --> 23:15.983
- Okay, honey, you have
to go with the nurse.

23:16.970 --> 23:19.100
- Nice to meet you guys.
- Yeah.

23:20.670 --> 23:22.490
- You have to go, sweetie.

23:22.490 --> 23:25.220
She has a brain tumor and
the procedure that she needs

23:25.220 --> 23:26.940
has a 4% survival rate.

23:26.940 --> 23:27.773
- Four?

23:27.773 --> 23:28.900
- [Angela] Mommy, come with me.

23:28.900 --> 23:30.007
- I can't, mija.

23:30.007 --> 23:32.490
- You'll be fine, sweetheart.

23:32.490 --> 23:34.683
- Go ahead, honey.
They'll take care of you.

23:36.570 --> 23:38.370
- She picked out her own gravestone.

23:40.937 --> 23:42.150
(woman sobbing)

23:42.150 --> 23:43.400
- I need to talk to them.

23:45.423 --> 23:46.773
I'll be right back.

23:50.290 --> 23:51.123
Excuse me.

23:52.069 --> 23:54.819
(birds chirping)

24:02.500 --> 24:03.333
- Can I help?

24:03.333 --> 24:04.400
- Whoa, not right now, buddy.

24:04.400 --> 24:05.380
I can get the other rake.

24:05.380 --> 24:06.480
- No, no no. Hey, hun!

24:09.350 --> 24:10.860
- Peter, can you come in, please, sweetie?

24:10.860 --> 24:13.120
Thank you. Dad's almost finished.

24:13.120 --> 24:13.970
- I'm sorry, bud.

24:21.990 --> 24:23.210
- Listen, I don't ask for much,

24:23.210 --> 24:24.960
but I need your help with all this.

24:26.438 --> 24:27.753
I really need your help.

24:31.818 --> 24:36.818
(gentle music)
(heart beating)

25:13.687 --> 25:16.354
(phone ringing)

25:26.470 --> 25:27.303
- Hey, Dr. Allen.

25:27.303 --> 25:31.453
- Jim, your body is 100% cancer-free.

25:34.120 --> 25:36.450
We just need to do a
few weeks of radiation

25:36.450 --> 25:39.563
where the lesion was, then
monitor, and that's it.

25:40.700 --> 25:42.833
I am honestly amazed.

25:45.243 --> 25:46.680
Jim?

25:46.680 --> 25:47.930
- Yeah, uh...

25:49.020 --> 25:49.853
Thank you.

25:51.980 --> 25:53.180
Yeah, that's great news.

25:59.450 --> 26:02.620
- Hey, we're going to go out
with some soccer friends to...

26:02.620 --> 26:03.453
What's wrong?

26:04.620 --> 26:05.827
- Dr. Allen called.

26:08.440 --> 26:09.273
I'm clean.

26:10.906 --> 26:12.270
- That's amazing.

26:12.270 --> 26:13.600
- I know.

26:13.600 --> 26:16.830
I know, but I like, I need to
talk to you about something.

26:16.830 --> 26:18.470
- Okay.

26:18.470 --> 26:20.920
You remember that day
I stayed after church?

26:20.920 --> 26:22.050
- Yeah.

26:22.050 --> 26:24.840
- Well, I prayed for a long time,

26:24.840 --> 26:28.883
like a really long time, and I
kind of asked God for a sign,

26:29.810 --> 26:31.970
and when you went to the store,

26:31.970 --> 26:34.510
I grabbed a glass out of the dishwasher.

26:34.510 --> 26:36.463
It was warm, you know, not hot,

26:37.430 --> 26:40.453
and when I went to get some
water, it cracked in my hand.

26:42.655 --> 26:43.488
- Okay.

26:45.240 --> 26:46.120
- Has that ever happened to you?

26:46.120 --> 26:49.600
- No, but I mean, it doesn't
seem very odd though.

26:49.600 --> 26:50.530
- Yeah, I know.

26:50.530 --> 26:51.580
It's never happened to me either,

26:51.580 --> 26:53.680
and I've probably done it a hundred times.

26:54.860 --> 26:56.430
- So you think that's a sign?

27:05.531 --> 27:06.985
- That was the crack.

27:06.985 --> 27:09.568
(gentle music)

27:11.450 --> 27:13.060
- Jimmy.

27:13.060 --> 27:13.893
- I know

27:14.908 --> 27:17.470
It was singed into my hand too,

27:17.470 --> 27:19.970
and I've been having
all these weird episodes

27:19.970 --> 27:22.320
where the entire world
just seems to slow down.

27:25.460 --> 27:27.790
And when I prayed, I
just sorta pled my case,

27:27.790 --> 27:30.650
that I had led a life
that he would be proud of,

27:30.650 --> 27:33.533
and you know, I promised that
if he got me through this,

27:33.533 --> 27:35.183
that I would do more.

27:36.680 --> 27:38.280
I'm just not sure what it means.

27:41.024 --> 27:42.374
What do you think it means?

27:45.650 --> 27:47.550
- It means you're supposed to do more.

27:52.647 --> 27:55.080
(traffic distantly roaring)

27:55.080 --> 27:55.913
- [Jimmy] Hey.

27:55.913 --> 27:57.040
- Thank you for coming.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.290
- Of course.

27:58.290 --> 27:59.230
- Hi.
- Nice to see you.

27:59.230 --> 28:00.063
- Same.

28:00.063 --> 28:02.324
Uh, you wanna be alone with her?

28:02.324 --> 28:03.310
- If that's okay.

28:03.310 --> 28:04.350
- Yes. Yes, of course.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.674
Whatever you want.

28:05.674 --> 28:07.010
- [Jimmy] Okay.

28:07.010 --> 28:08.050
- Sweetie, we're going to go

28:08.050 --> 28:09.940
pick up some lunch for you, okay?

28:09.940 --> 28:11.074
- [Angela] Okay.

28:11.074 --> 28:11.907
- Bye.

28:17.310 --> 28:18.328
- Hi, Angela.

28:18.328 --> 28:19.600
- Hi.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.100
- I'm Mr. Valentino.

28:21.100 --> 28:22.590
Your parents told you I was coming, right?

28:22.590 --> 28:23.573
- Yes.
- Yeah.

28:25.959 --> 28:27.160
- Do you mind if I sit down?

28:27.160 --> 28:27.993
- Sure.

28:31.390 --> 28:32.533
- What are you drawing?

28:34.480 --> 28:36.080
Wow, that's really good.

28:36.080 --> 28:37.207
- Thank you.

28:37.207 --> 28:39.280
- You know, my daughter plays soccer.

28:39.280 --> 28:40.113
- How old is she?

28:40.113 --> 28:41.430
- She's 12.

28:41.430 --> 28:43.169
Maybe you guys will be on
the same high school team.

28:43.169 --> 28:44.002
- Yeah.

28:45.700 --> 28:48.020
- Did your parents tell
you anything about me?

28:48.020 --> 28:50.780
- They told me you had
cancer and it went away fast.

28:50.780 --> 28:54.340
- That's right, and
nobody knows how I did it.

28:54.340 --> 28:55.490
Do you want me to know?

28:57.550 --> 28:58.699
- I talked to God.

28:58.699 --> 29:01.850
- Oh, we say prayers all day.

29:01.850 --> 29:03.440
- Okay.

29:03.440 --> 29:05.820
Well, I'm going to tell you
something very important.

29:05.820 --> 29:06.910
There is a big difference

29:06.910 --> 29:10.750
between saying prayers and praying.

29:10.750 --> 29:12.360
- [Angela] What?

29:12.360 --> 29:13.910
- You have to make it personal.

29:14.930 --> 29:17.110
I talk to Jesus about
what's going on in my life

29:17.110 --> 29:19.010
like he's my best friend.

29:19.010 --> 29:21.430
I thank him for everything
he's done for me.

29:21.430 --> 29:23.770
I say sorry for the things
that I've done wrong,

29:23.770 --> 29:28.770
and I ask him for what I
need, and then I say prayers

29:29.180 --> 29:31.548
and ask him to take what
I need to his father.

29:31.548 --> 29:32.381
- Yeah.

29:32.381 --> 29:33.917
- Can I show you how I think it works?

29:33.917 --> 29:34.750
- Sure.

29:35.780 --> 29:37.700
- Okay, so...

29:38.820 --> 29:41.460
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29:41.460 --> 29:44.853
- This is the Father at the top.

29:46.090 --> 29:48.660
This is Jesus in the middle,

29:48.660 --> 29:51.163
and this is me at the bottom.

29:57.590 --> 30:02.590
And this is the Holy Spirit
taking what I need to Jesus.

30:04.530 --> 30:09.150
And this is the Holy
Spirit taking what I need

30:09.150 --> 30:10.403
from Jesus to his father,

30:11.810 --> 30:16.730
and this is God giving
me what I'm asking for.

30:16.730 --> 30:18.920
- Does it work all the time?

30:18.920 --> 30:21.960
- No, at least not right away.

30:21.960 --> 30:23.510
So here's what I think happens.

30:25.670 --> 30:28.130
Some prayers are more
important than others.

30:28.130 --> 30:32.850
Like, if you were praying for a bike,

30:32.850 --> 30:34.750
it would be down there.

30:34.750 --> 30:35.583
- [Angela] Yeah.

30:36.490 --> 30:39.390
- And if you were praying
for food that you needed,

30:39.390 --> 30:44.200
then that would be up here,
and you have to keep praying

30:44.200 --> 30:45.580
to keep your prayers on God's list,

30:45.580 --> 30:48.830
and eventually, he'll get to yours.

30:48.830 --> 30:49.790
- I can do that.

30:49.790 --> 30:51.410
- I know you can,

30:51.410 --> 30:55.193
and I think your prayers
will go straight to the top,

30:56.570 --> 30:58.833
but there's one big secret.

31:01.200 --> 31:02.033
You ready?

31:03.360 --> 31:04.830
You have to believe it.

31:05.930 --> 31:07.513
You have to really believe it.

31:08.720 --> 31:09.933
See, a lot of people,

31:10.890 --> 31:13.443
they say that they believe
it, but deep, deep down,

31:14.500 --> 31:16.443
they don't think that it's going to work.

31:18.103 --> 31:19.100
So, can you do that?

31:19.100 --> 31:21.570
Can you promise me that
you'll really believe it?

31:21.570 --> 31:22.403
- Yes.

31:22.403 --> 31:23.260
- Okay.

31:23.260 --> 31:26.180
Now, I want you to do
this every night, okay?

31:26.180 --> 31:28.910
And you need to know,
when you go to sleep,

31:28.910 --> 31:31.463
that when you wake up,
you're going to be fine.

31:32.720 --> 31:33.553
You got it?

31:33.553 --> 31:35.366
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

31:35.366 --> 31:37.210
It's kind of like Christmas Eve.

31:37.210 --> 31:38.400
What happens when you wake up?

31:38.400 --> 31:39.360
- I get presents.

31:39.360 --> 31:40.990
- That's right. It's the same thing.

31:40.990 --> 31:42.640
- Yeah.

31:42.640 --> 31:43.510
You want to try one together?

31:43.510 --> 31:44.530
- Sure.

31:44.530 --> 31:46.487
- Okay. Let me see your hand.

31:50.230 --> 31:55.230
(mystical music)
(monitor beeping)

32:13.351 --> 32:15.070
- Okay, I've just got a
doctor appointment 'til five.

32:15.070 --> 32:16.393
I'll call you from my house.

32:19.040 --> 32:21.153
Okay, yeah, I'll talk to you then.

32:24.800 --> 32:27.000
- What did you do when
you were with Angela?

32:28.950 --> 32:32.223
We just prayed.

32:33.090 --> 32:34.490
What's wrong?

32:34.490 --> 32:35.323
- She...

32:36.480 --> 32:37.873
Her tumor is gone.

32:41.280 --> 32:42.930
- You scared the sugar out of me.

32:44.860 --> 32:45.942
She's fine?

32:45.942 --> 32:47.700
(peaceful music)

32:47.700 --> 32:48.850
- You're his messenger.

32:50.550 --> 32:51.807
- Oh, no, no, no.

32:51.807 --> 32:54.490
I'm not anything. I'm...

32:56.490 --> 32:57.593
- Angela drew this.

32:58.870 --> 33:01.350
She had a dream about it that night.

33:01.350 --> 33:02.600
She wants you to keep it.

33:09.210 --> 33:10.043
- Thank you.

33:13.720 --> 33:14.583
Good job.

33:16.972 --> 33:18.914
(Jimmy groaning)
(Scarlett giggling)

33:18.914 --> 33:20.342
I got it!

33:20.342 --> 33:21.667
You ready? One more.

33:22.523 --> 33:24.530
All right, really blast it, sweety.

33:24.530 --> 33:25.868
I want to see that leg.

33:25.868 --> 33:30.868
(gentle music)
(heart beating)

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
- Dad, roll it back!

33:37.210 --> 33:38.263
- Mr. Valentino?

33:39.490 --> 33:41.010
- Hi.

33:41.010 --> 33:42.810
- May I speak with you for a minute?

33:44.000 --> 33:44.833
- Sure.

33:45.840 --> 33:46.750
- [Man] Hey there.

33:46.750 --> 33:47.583
- Hi.

33:47.583 --> 33:49.110
- Nice kick.
- Thanks.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.583
I'm Kevin Flynn.

33:50.583 --> 33:53.433
Bob Ramos is one of my employees.

33:54.540 --> 33:55.490
- Nice to meet you.

33:56.770 --> 33:57.920
Sweetie, why don't you go see Mommy

33:57.920 --> 33:58.994
while I talk to Mr. Flynn here?

33:58.994 --> 33:59.827
- Okay.

33:59.827 --> 34:01.480
- Okay. Thanks.

34:01.480 --> 34:04.240
- Look, I'm sorry to just
drop in on you like this,

34:04.240 --> 34:07.210
but there's been a lot of chatter,

34:07.210 --> 34:09.750
a lot of speculation about his daughter,

34:09.750 --> 34:12.030
and he was kind enough to tell me

34:12.030 --> 34:14.043
about your visit with Angela.

34:15.660 --> 34:16.493
- Okay.

34:16.493 --> 34:19.050
- But he told me that
because my wife's ill.

34:19.050 --> 34:22.533
Terminally ill.
(somber music)

34:24.150 --> 34:25.500
She's a wonderful person.

34:25.500 --> 34:26.377
She, uh..

34:27.580 --> 34:29.723
We have two kids. She's a great mother.

34:32.771 --> 34:34.703
We wouldn't last a week without her.

34:37.660 --> 34:39.260
Would you come visit her please?

34:41.530 --> 34:42.960
- Oh, uh...

34:45.310 --> 34:46.870
- Mr. Flynn-
- Kevin.

34:46.870 --> 34:47.703
- Kevin.

34:49.130 --> 34:51.503
I had quite a bit of a scare myself,

34:52.420 --> 34:55.420
and I'm just trying to get my
life back to normal, you know?

34:56.255 --> 35:01.000
And I'm not sure exactly
what happened with Angela.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.280
I mean, I'm just not.

35:03.280 --> 35:05.790
I'm not sure I had anything to do with it.

35:05.790 --> 35:07.890
- The doctors don't know how to treat her.

35:10.220 --> 35:11.913
Mr. Valentino, I'm begging you.

35:13.010 --> 35:15.853
Please. Please, just
see her for 10 minutes.

35:16.920 --> 35:17.916
I'll repay the favor.

35:17.916 --> 35:21.593
- No, no, I don't need any of that.

35:25.170 --> 35:26.283
- She's dying, Jim.

35:32.916 --> 35:34.730
(knocking)

35:34.730 --> 35:36.030
- [Jimmy] Hi.

35:36.030 --> 35:37.580
- Hi.

35:37.580 --> 35:38.920
- I'm Jimmy.

35:38.920 --> 35:39.753
- Hi.

35:41.150 --> 35:42.643
- Is Kevin a florist?

35:44.086 --> 35:47.003
(Patricia giggles)

35:48.510 --> 35:50.480
You want to tell me what's going on?

35:50.480 --> 35:51.313
- I wish I knew.

35:52.670 --> 35:55.220
I started feeling sick about a week ago,

35:55.220 --> 35:56.563
did a bunch of tests,

35:57.510 --> 36:01.053
and apparently I have a
bacterial infection in my blood.

36:03.200 --> 36:05.500
They're still trying to
figure out what it is.

36:06.446 --> 36:09.150
- Forgive me, but you
don't look very sick.

36:12.150 --> 36:13.320
- Honestly, I don't feel sick

36:13.320 --> 36:14.520
most of the time either.

36:17.582 --> 36:18.820
But when it hits...

36:21.649 --> 36:24.649
(Patricia sniffles)

36:29.070 --> 36:30.050
They're saying it's only a matter of time

36:30.050 --> 36:31.593
until my organs shut down.

36:35.192 --> 36:36.183
- How much time?

36:39.570 --> 36:42.693
- Days, hours.

36:42.693 --> 36:43.860
We don't know.

36:49.049 --> 36:50.849
I'm not ready to say goodbye, Jimmy.

36:54.030 --> 36:54.863
Okay.

36:56.026 --> 36:58.609
Well, let's see what we can do.

37:01.102 --> 37:02.602
Give me your hand.

37:05.741 --> 37:10.741
(gentle music)
(monitor beeping)

37:43.971 --> 37:45.607
Okay, okay, okay.

37:45.607 --> 37:48.357
(doorbell rings)

37:55.118 --> 37:57.785
(birds singing)

38:26.915 --> 38:29.680
(knocking)

38:29.680 --> 38:30.573
- Mr. Valentino?

38:31.430 --> 38:33.200
We'd like to speak with
you about Patricia Flynn.

38:33.200 --> 38:34.500
Do you have a few minutes?

38:35.900 --> 38:36.733
- No, I don't.

38:36.733 --> 38:38.420
I'm late for a doctor's appointment,

38:38.420 --> 38:39.860
and how do you know about that?

38:39.860 --> 38:40.810
- Everybody knows.

38:40.810 --> 38:42.390
Her son posted a video thanking you.

38:42.390 --> 38:43.290
Do you mind if we roll?

38:43.290 --> 38:44.440
- What? Yes, I mind.

38:44.440 --> 38:45.830
Please turn that off.

38:45.830 --> 38:47.800
What happened with Mrs. Flynn is private.

38:47.800 --> 38:48.757
- Well, not anymore.

38:48.757 --> 38:50.963
"Her Son's Case, Flynn,"
from Love Me Three.

38:52.380 --> 38:53.663
Boy band, multi-platinum.

38:58.200 --> 38:59.033
- Whatever.

38:59.033 --> 39:00.570
I mean, how many people
could have possibly seen it?

39:00.570 --> 39:02.083
- Oh, as of now, 140 million.

39:02.083 --> 39:05.291
- Big deal.
- Million.

39:05.291 --> 39:06.623
Oh, 141 million.

39:06.623 --> 39:08.623
Oh, 143.

39:11.140 --> 39:12.240
- [Man] Mr. Valentino?

39:13.197 --> 39:15.380
Could you please help my sister?

39:15.380 --> 39:18.170
- Mr. Valentino, this
story is going to be told,

39:18.170 --> 39:21.693
and you need to tell it,
or the wrong people will.

39:22.620 --> 39:23.540
Trust me on that.

39:23.540 --> 39:26.983
- [Woman] Mr. Valentino,
do you have a few minutes?

39:28.840 --> 39:30.640
- Come back this weekend.

39:30.640 --> 39:31.483
- Great, okay.

39:33.290 --> 39:35.977
- [Man] Jimmy, do you have a few minutes?

39:37.150 --> 39:41.113
- So you fully recovered Mrs.
Flynn and the young girl?

39:42.840 --> 39:44.490
- Yes.

39:44.490 --> 39:45.443
- How'd you do it?

39:46.295 --> 39:48.440
- No, I didn't do it.

39:48.440 --> 39:50.130
I just helped.

39:50.130 --> 39:50.980
- Through prayer.

39:51.950 --> 39:52.783
- That's right.

39:53.670 --> 39:55.070
- Do you think God sent you?

39:57.390 --> 40:00.221
- No. No, I'm not him.

40:00.221 --> 40:02.332
- But the chances of
three complete recoveries

40:02.332 --> 40:04.063
must be astronomical.

40:06.160 --> 40:09.100
- Listen, I can't quote the
Bible, but I know that in it,

40:09.100 --> 40:12.060
Jesus says something to the effect of,

40:12.060 --> 40:13.470
you can do more than what I've done,

40:13.470 --> 40:15.300
because I'll ask my father for you,

40:15.300 --> 40:17.853
and that's all I tried to do.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.693
- So, God can save someone
who's about to die?

40:22.640 --> 40:23.690
- He can do anything.

40:24.730 --> 40:26.223
- Can anyone call on him?

40:28.880 --> 40:30.163
- Yeah, I guess.

40:31.180 --> 40:32.330
Anyone who believes it.

40:35.720 --> 40:37.330
- Jim, it's a distraction.

40:37.330 --> 40:38.210
The lawyers are saying

40:38.210 --> 40:39.760
it's going to affect the deal's closing.

40:39.760 --> 40:40.593
- Come on.

40:40.593 --> 40:42.190
- Everyone knows you're
an executive here now,

40:42.190 --> 40:43.290
and the brand's taking a hit.

40:43.290 --> 40:44.550
We're getting dozens of calls

40:44.550 --> 40:46.725
from groups saying they're
going to boycott our products.

40:46.725 --> 40:47.930
- That's ridiculous.

40:47.930 --> 40:50.893
- It's beside the point
and you need to refocus.

40:53.950 --> 40:56.970
And you should look into
getting an attorney too.

40:56.970 --> 40:58.190
Doctors all over the country

40:58.190 --> 41:00.290
are saying what you're doing is dangerous.

41:01.550 --> 41:04.380
- Listen, I just want
things to go back to normal.

41:04.380 --> 41:06.810
Yeah, I just want to
take care of my family.

41:06.810 --> 41:07.643
- I'll talk to Mark.

41:07.643 --> 41:09.714
Hopefully this just blows over.

41:09.714 --> 41:10.547
- Okay.

41:11.620 --> 41:13.490
- Jimmy, that integration
is a big step for me.

41:13.490 --> 41:16.313
So let's get it together, okay?

41:17.520 --> 41:18.353
- Okay.

41:19.460 --> 41:20.783
Okay. You got it.

41:21.740 --> 41:22.960
- What do you mean you
don't want to do it anymore?

41:22.960 --> 41:24.723
- I just don't want to do it anymore.

41:25.830 --> 41:27.080
- What are you afraid of?

41:29.520 --> 41:32.220
- I'm afraid of losing everything, okay?

41:32.220 --> 41:33.420
Tracy, if I'm let go,

41:33.420 --> 41:36.240
and trust me, she wants
me out, it's all over.

41:36.240 --> 41:37.460
All of this is over.

41:37.460 --> 41:38.650
- That's...

41:39.630 --> 41:41.530
Not what you should fear.

41:41.530 --> 41:42.830
- I didn't ask for this.

41:42.830 --> 41:44.680
- Well, maybe you did.

41:44.680 --> 41:47.263
(somber music)

41:49.610 --> 41:52.290
- What if I had nothing to
do with helping those people?

41:52.290 --> 41:53.740
- What if you never find out?

41:59.860 --> 42:01.110
That's from Angela Ramos.

42:04.420 --> 42:05.320
She saw it in her dream

42:05.320 --> 42:07.420
the night that you visited Patricia Flynn.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.350
What really matters, Jimmy?

42:20.844 --> 42:22.460
(traffic roaring)

42:22.460 --> 42:23.370
- What if we take this out

42:23.370 --> 42:24.910
one more year at the same CAGR?

42:24.910 --> 42:26.390
- 23.57.

42:26.390 --> 42:27.850
- Can you add a column?
- Yeah.

42:27.850 --> 42:30.433
(somber music)

42:34.790 --> 42:37.010
- Hey Jim, don't forget the lights.

42:37.010 --> 42:37.960
- See you tomorrow.

42:43.240 --> 42:45.330
- When's Daddy getting home?

42:45.330 --> 42:46.920
- Later.

42:46.920 --> 42:47.840
- So, nothing else. That's it.

42:47.840 --> 42:49.727
- Maybe we can figure
something out for you.

42:49.727 --> 42:51.140
- No, I'm done!

42:51.140 --> 42:52.390
I'm done.
(laughing)

42:52.390 --> 42:53.223
Thanks, Eddie.

42:54.130 --> 42:55.770
You made it really easy on me, man.

42:55.770 --> 42:56.603
I owe you one.

42:56.603 --> 42:58.350
- My pleasure. Mr. Valentino.

42:58.350 --> 42:59.570
Keeping you well prevents others

42:59.570 --> 43:01.200
from having to come and see me.

43:01.200 --> 43:02.280
All right. Take care.

43:02.280 --> 43:03.113
- Take care.

43:03.980 --> 43:05.270
Oh, you didn't have to come.

43:05.270 --> 43:07.690
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you.

43:07.690 --> 43:09.800
- I never miss a reason to celebrate.

43:09.800 --> 43:11.469
There's not enough of them.

43:11.469 --> 43:12.620
- Thank you.

43:12.620 --> 43:13.720
- Of course.

43:13.720 --> 43:15.552
- I'll never forget all
your help with this.

43:15.552 --> 43:18.385
(family laughing)

43:25.655 --> 43:27.438
What are you guys playing with those for?

43:27.438 --> 43:28.271
- Whoa!

43:30.960 --> 43:33.020
- Come on, gimme hugs.
- What do you guys say?

43:33.020 --> 43:33.853
- Thank you!

43:33.853 --> 43:34.686
- Oh, you're welcome.

43:36.085 --> 43:38.239
Look at it. It lights up, you see that?

43:38.239 --> 43:41.190
(doorbell rings)

43:41.190 --> 43:42.777
I'll get it.

43:42.777 --> 43:44.493
- [Tracy] That's so cool.

43:48.400 --> 43:51.300
- I'm sorry for bothering you
at your home, Mr. Valentino.

43:52.499 --> 43:53.332
- Hi.

43:53.332 --> 43:55.140
My mother has been in
the hospital for a while

43:55.140 --> 43:57.680
and I was really hoping you can visit her.

43:57.680 --> 44:00.350
- I wish I could, but you can imagine

44:00.350 --> 44:02.160
how many requests I get like this,

44:02.160 --> 44:03.330
and there's just no place for me

44:03.330 --> 44:05.160
to draw the line between yes and no.

44:05.160 --> 44:06.523
- She's very religious.

44:07.810 --> 44:08.963
Our whole family is.

44:11.660 --> 44:12.493
- I'm sorry.

44:16.330 --> 44:17.730
I'm not the one who does it.

44:20.720 --> 44:22.410
I'll keep her in my prayers though, okay?

44:22.410 --> 44:23.243
- [Woman] Okay.

44:23.243 --> 44:24.510
- Okay.

44:24.510 --> 44:25.343
- I'm sorry.

44:31.490 --> 44:33.683
- You sound like you're actually
starting to believe that.

44:44.690 --> 44:45.523
Hey, Mark.

44:45.523 --> 44:46.356
- Hey, Jimmy.

44:46.356 --> 44:47.340
Do you wanna get the door for me, please?

44:47.340 --> 44:48.173
- Absolutely.

44:50.640 --> 44:51.741
- So, listen.

44:51.741 --> 44:55.180
At this meeting, I'll give him the update,

44:55.180 --> 44:57.460
then I'll turn it over
to you for the timeline.

44:57.460 --> 44:58.293
- No problem.

45:00.190 --> 45:01.770
- The board likes you, Jim.

45:01.770 --> 45:03.570
They mention it after every meeting.

45:03.570 --> 45:04.403
- Oh, thanks.

45:04.403 --> 45:06.893
It's my favorite part of
the job, to be honest.

45:08.950 --> 45:09.790
I let them know you're going to

45:09.790 --> 45:11.440
head up the integration team too.

45:12.780 --> 45:13.680
- What about Jane?

45:15.360 --> 45:16.530
- I'll take care of that.

45:16.530 --> 45:18.430
You just keep the deal on track, okay?

45:19.550 --> 45:20.383
- Okay.

45:24.937 --> 45:29.937
(heart beating)
(tense music)

45:35.779 --> 45:37.696
- I'll send you a link.

45:45.990 --> 45:48.710
- It doesn't appear that
the driver was impaired.

45:48.710 --> 45:49.963
It's more likely he either

45:49.963 --> 45:53.200
fell asleep at the wheel or blacked out.

45:53.200 --> 45:56.390
Four children, all under the age of 10,

45:56.390 --> 45:58.460
have been killed.

45:58.460 --> 45:59.563
Two of them, sisters.

46:00.690 --> 46:02.870
The younger brother who was also struck

46:02.870 --> 46:05.290
is listed in critical condition.

46:05.290 --> 46:08.365
I'm Caroline Brown with
Channel Seven News.

46:08.365 --> 46:11.480
(somber music)

46:11.480 --> 46:13.670
(phone beeping)

46:13.670 --> 46:14.910
- [Jane] What is it, Jim?

46:14.910 --> 46:17.480
- I resign, immediately.

46:17.480 --> 46:18.610
- You can't leave.

46:18.610 --> 46:21.633
I'll talk to Mark about getting
you a retention bonus, Jim.

46:22.630 --> 46:24.140
Jim?

46:24.140 --> 46:26.120
- He has life-threatening injuries.

46:26.120 --> 46:28.530
He needs proper intensive
medical treatment.

46:28.530 --> 46:31.050
- With all due respect,
he needs more than that.

46:31.050 --> 46:33.190
- Mr. Valentino, this is science.

46:33.190 --> 46:35.560
We are dealing with biological facts.

46:35.560 --> 46:37.560
His parents don't need you going in there,

46:37.560 --> 46:39.982
feeding them some nonsense
that their son is going to...

46:39.982 --> 46:41.920
(tense music)
(heart beating)

46:41.920 --> 46:45.637
Somehow magically be
the same as he once was.

46:53.190 --> 46:55.440
- Go and tell his parents that
I'm here and let them decide.

46:55.440 --> 46:56.740
- You people don't get it.

46:57.630 --> 46:58.940
There's a considerable difference

46:58.940 --> 47:00.890
between someone who is a medical expert

47:02.340 --> 47:03.440
and someone who's not.

47:05.630 --> 47:07.030
- Do you expect to save him?

47:09.901 --> 47:11.473
- I'm honestly not sure.

47:12.750 --> 47:16.293
Then you have to let me try.
(gentle music)

47:22.510 --> 47:26.560
- He was released just two days
after Mr. Valentino's visit.

47:26.560 --> 47:28.990
The doctors ran extensive tests,

47:28.990 --> 47:31.930
finding no traces of internal damage.

47:31.930 --> 47:34.020
Mr. Valentino has agreed to give us

47:34.020 --> 47:36.620
a follow-up interview in a few days.

47:36.620 --> 47:40.010
Details regarding services
for the young boy' sisters

47:40.010 --> 47:41.410
can be found on our website.

47:43.940 --> 47:45.333
- You're doing the right thing.

47:47.650 --> 47:49.127
- I hope so.

47:49.127 --> 47:51.077
- You can't put a light under a basket.

47:59.947 --> 48:02.530
(gentle music)

48:04.518 --> 48:06.840
Did you ask Carmen if
these are from a painting?

48:06.840 --> 48:08.690
- She said no. Angela just sees them.

48:13.900 --> 48:16.600
- I think we post the
video before the interview.

48:16.600 --> 48:18.070
There's so much buzz around Kace

48:18.070 --> 48:20.800
that the network might
request a national broadcast.

48:20.800 --> 48:21.633
- Yeah.

48:22.540 --> 48:23.373
Yeah?

48:25.220 --> 48:27.426
Okay. Where should we shoot it?

48:27.426 --> 48:28.650
- We'll record it here.

48:28.650 --> 48:30.150
It has to feel real, ya know?

48:30.150 --> 48:31.030
- And just be natural.

48:31.030 --> 48:32.070
Don't rush it.

48:32.070 --> 48:33.540
If the video's longer than a minute,

48:33.540 --> 48:35.490
we'll break it up into separate posts.

48:35.490 --> 48:36.550
- Exactly.

48:36.550 --> 48:39.080
- Are you sure you want to do this, Jim?

48:39.080 --> 48:40.720
I mean, between Walt and Oprah here,

48:40.720 --> 48:42.730
the whole world's going to see it.

48:42.730 --> 48:43.563
- Yeah.

48:44.610 --> 48:45.443
I have to.

48:46.769 --> 48:47.602
- Dad!

48:47.602 --> 48:49.503
Peter keeps hiding puzzle pieces on me.

48:52.630 --> 48:55.713
(Scarlett screaming)

48:58.741 --> 49:00.467
I'm getting my phone!

49:00.467 --> 49:03.217
(peaceful music)

49:04.570 --> 49:05.403
- Every time?

49:06.440 --> 49:07.361
Every time.

49:07.361 --> 49:12.361
(upbeat music)
(group laughing)

49:12.400 --> 49:13.450
- I'm Jimmy Valentino

49:13.450 --> 49:15.890
and I wanted to just talk a second about

49:15.890 --> 49:19.010
all the speculation that's
been going on about me.

49:19.010 --> 49:21.809
Yes, it is true that I
was able to heal myself

49:21.809 --> 49:23.198
from the terrible illness

49:23.198 --> 49:25.253
by deepening my relationship with God,

49:26.727 --> 49:29.780
and it is true that I helped other people

49:29.780 --> 49:33.628
heal themselves by deepening
their relationship with God,

49:33.628 --> 49:34.740
and I just want everyone to know that

49:34.740 --> 49:36.333
I'm not saying that I'm Jesus Christ

49:36.333 --> 49:40.350
and I'm not saying that I am
God or that God sent me here.

49:40.350 --> 49:45.133
I'm simply saying it is
my goal to help people.

49:47.985 --> 49:49.535
All right, where am I tomorrow?

49:50.370 --> 49:51.838
- [Tracy] Mercy Hospital.

49:51.838 --> 49:52.973
- Okay, where is that?

49:52.973 --> 49:56.880
- It's in Franklin, so
it's about 45 minutes east,

49:56.880 --> 49:59.780
and then your next one
is not until Friday.

49:59.780 --> 50:01.140
Oh, and we didn't qualify

50:01.140 --> 50:03.750
for the financial
assistance on the insurance.

50:03.750 --> 50:05.420
- We have no income.

50:05.420 --> 50:07.483
- They based it on last year's returns.

50:11.794 --> 50:14.730
(phone dings)

50:14.730 --> 50:16.030
Hey, Scarlett?

50:16.030 --> 50:16.863
- [Scarlett] Yeah?

50:16.863 --> 50:17.696
- Would you come show Daddy

50:17.696 --> 50:19.210
how to slide into his DMs again?

50:21.770 --> 50:23.620
- That's not how you use that saying.

50:28.800 --> 50:30.093
- Thank you, sweety.

50:35.397 --> 50:36.875
- What?

50:36.875 --> 50:37.708
- A weird message.

50:37.708 --> 50:40.023
Do you have a Derek Brooks on the list?

50:42.370 --> 50:43.203
- No.

50:44.345 --> 50:46.040
(knocking)

50:46.040 --> 50:47.030
- [Jim] Mr. Brooks?

50:47.030 --> 50:47.863
- [Derek] Yeah.

50:49.850 --> 50:52.977
Hi, can I come in?

50:52.977 --> 50:56.223
- Hey, it's the miracle worker.

50:59.050 --> 51:00.350
- How are you, Mr. Brooks?

51:01.360 --> 51:04.850
- Well, they tell me I'm
down to my last few days,

51:04.850 --> 51:06.180
but now that you're here,

51:06.180 --> 51:08.700
I don't have to worry about that, right?

51:08.700 --> 51:10.983
- So, they know it's
down to just a few days?

51:11.870 --> 51:13.440
- I refused further treatment.

51:13.440 --> 51:17.300
They say it's a matter of time
before my body shuts down.

51:17.300 --> 51:18.340
- Why did you stop?

51:18.340 --> 51:21.170
- Because I've been praying.

51:21.170 --> 51:22.860
That's the secret, isn't it?

51:22.860 --> 51:24.420
- There is no secret.

51:24.420 --> 51:27.628
- Uh-huh.

51:27.628 --> 51:30.211
(Derek coughs)

51:33.400 --> 51:34.233
Nerve damage.

51:35.140 --> 51:37.380
Yeah, medicine kills a
lot more than the tumor.

51:37.380 --> 51:38.503
- I'm sorry.

51:40.850 --> 51:43.623
- So, come on.

51:44.680 --> 51:45.513
Heal me.

51:47.060 --> 51:49.890
- Mr. Brooks, you have to
be in the right disposition

51:49.890 --> 51:52.690
if you want to get well, okay?

51:52.690 --> 51:54.083
This is not a transaction.

51:55.100 --> 51:57.150
- Okay, well, here's how I understand it.

51:57.150 --> 52:00.370
I need to talk to God,

52:00.370 --> 52:03.010
and then I need to believe
that he's going to heal me.

52:03.010 --> 52:03.843
- Those are the basics, yes.

52:03.843 --> 52:05.830
- Without medicine or operations.

52:05.830 --> 52:06.751
- [Jimmy] Yes.

52:06.751 --> 52:09.251
(tense music)

52:10.870 --> 52:12.450
- Mr. Valentino, I have been

52:12.450 --> 52:15.010
fighting this disease for three years.

52:15.010 --> 52:17.660
I've had 24 operations.

52:17.660 --> 52:22.660
I have spent days in pain, agonizing pain,

52:23.230 --> 52:25.180
that only goes away when
they give me enough drugs

52:25.180 --> 52:28.176
to put me in outer space.

52:28.176 --> 52:31.273
Do you know what else I've
been doing for three years?

52:32.720 --> 52:33.733
Praying!

52:34.750 --> 52:36.600
- [Jimmy] Praying, or saying prayers?

52:39.120 --> 52:41.030
- Whatever it is, it hasn't done a thing.

52:41.030 --> 52:42.560
So now that you're here,

52:42.560 --> 52:45.303
it's either going to save
me or it's going to kill me.

52:47.290 --> 52:48.123
So...

52:49.539 --> 52:50.689
What do you say, Jimmy?

52:52.310 --> 52:53.223
Can God save me?

52:55.350 --> 52:56.300
- Of course he can.

52:58.160 --> 52:59.230
But you have to-

52:59.230 --> 53:02.653
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, no,
that's all I need to hear.

53:04.649 --> 53:06.297
Let's do one.

53:06.297 --> 53:07.530
What's the, um...

53:09.280 --> 53:10.243
Protocol here?

53:13.170 --> 53:14.003
- Huh.

53:15.670 --> 53:16.503
- What is that?

53:19.420 --> 53:21.940
- Angela dreamt that the
night I visited Brooks.

53:21.940 --> 53:23.230
- Is that Joan of Arc?

53:23.230 --> 53:24.280
- It's Saint Michael.

53:25.370 --> 53:27.080
- Oh, I just always thought that

53:27.080 --> 53:28.883
he looked a little tougher than that.

53:30.740 --> 53:32.470
- This doesn't make any sense.

53:32.470 --> 53:35.423
All of her other sketches
were, you know, hopeful.

53:36.430 --> 53:37.280
- And that's not?

53:38.730 --> 53:40.880
- Saint Michael comes
at the hour of death.

53:41.990 --> 53:42.823
- Oh.

53:51.340 --> 53:53.900
It's Moretto.
(somber music)

53:53.900 --> 53:54.733
- Moretto?

53:56.180 --> 53:57.730
- Where are her other sketches?

54:01.240 --> 54:02.240
It's the coronation.

54:12.770 --> 54:13.603
There.

54:14.763 --> 54:15.596
And there.

54:18.621 --> 54:21.288
(ominous music)

54:24.420 --> 54:25.443
You were there.

54:35.916 --> 54:36.749
There.

54:45.590 --> 54:47.000
- That's from Angela Ramos.

54:47.000 --> 54:47.860
She saw it in her dream

54:47.860 --> 54:49.710
the night you visited Patricia Flynn.

54:57.950 --> 54:59.000
- You were all there.

55:02.250 --> 55:04.233
- [Man] She had a dream
about it that night.

55:14.886 --> 55:17.190
- Why is Jesus missing?

55:17.190 --> 55:18.023
- I don't know.

55:19.810 --> 55:21.610
Hey, guys, would you grab an apple?

55:21.610 --> 55:23.240
- We like these better.

55:23.240 --> 55:25.100
- We're gonna need to
start donating these,

55:25.100 --> 55:27.485
or our kids are gonna
lose all their teeth.

55:27.485 --> 55:29.620
(doorbell rings)
(knocking)

55:29.620 --> 55:32.560
- I'm gonna call Robert
about this tomorrow.

55:32.560 --> 55:33.700
- If there's any candy in this one,

55:33.700 --> 55:35.040
will you tell the driver to keep it?

55:35.040 --> 55:36.540
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

55:40.230 --> 55:42.930
- Could we speak with you
for a minute, Mr. Valentino?

55:44.030 --> 55:45.103
- Sure. Come on in.

55:51.140 --> 55:52.200
Can I help you?

55:52.200 --> 55:55.510
- Mr. Valentino, we have
a warrant for your arrest.

55:55.510 --> 55:56.500
- What are you talking about?

55:56.500 --> 55:59.070
- Could you please come
with us, Mr. Valentino?

55:59.070 --> 56:00.270
- Can I see the warrant?

56:04.640 --> 56:05.600
Manslaughter?

56:05.600 --> 56:07.560
- Derek Brooks died Monday night.

56:07.560 --> 56:08.990
According to his doctor's complaint,

56:08.990 --> 56:12.070
he refused any treatments
based on your advice.

56:12.070 --> 56:14.040
We have other complaints and fatalities

56:14.040 --> 56:14.873
from outside the county as well.

56:14.873 --> 56:16.910
- What, people I've never even met with?

56:16.910 --> 56:17.743
- [Tracy] What's going on?

56:17.743 --> 56:20.250
- Mr. Valentino, you do
need to come with us now.

56:20.250 --> 56:21.440
- But Derek Brooks didn't-

56:21.440 --> 56:22.273
- Mr. Valentino,

56:22.273 --> 56:24.920
think carefully before
you say anything else.

56:24.920 --> 56:25.990
- [Officer] You have the
right to remain silent.

56:25.990 --> 56:26.823
- I'll be there as soon as I can.

56:26.823 --> 56:27.656
- [Scarlett] Dad, can we kick the ball?

56:27.656 --> 56:28.489
- Get the kids.

56:28.489 --> 56:29.610
- You have the right to an attorney.

56:29.610 --> 56:30.700
If you cannot afford an attorney,

56:30.700 --> 56:32.483
one will be provided for you.

56:33.361 --> 56:36.194
(traffic roaring)

56:39.290 --> 56:40.690
- I gotta be out of my mind.

56:51.956 --> 56:54.979
(ominous music)

56:54.979 --> 56:56.500
- You keep pretending
you're the second coming,

56:56.500 --> 56:57.333
and there's going to be

56:57.333 --> 56:59.500
a lot worse than jail coming your way.

56:59.500 --> 57:01.200
- Guys, we don't want any trouble.

57:01.200 --> 57:02.033
Hey!

57:02.033 --> 57:06.773
(tense music)
(Jim groaning)

57:07.830 --> 57:09.480
- We hear about him
playing God one more time,

57:09.480 --> 57:11.830
he's going to end up with
a bullet in his head.

57:12.840 --> 57:13.733
You too.

57:16.504 --> 57:18.028
- Jim, Jim, Jim?

57:18.028 --> 57:19.111
Are you okay?

57:30.315 --> 57:33.065
(birds chirping)

57:34.440 --> 57:35.273
- They wanna do it.

57:35.273 --> 57:36.900
- I really appreciate the offer, Kevin,

57:36.900 --> 57:38.000
but I can't accept it.

57:39.880 --> 57:41.930
- They're the best lawyers on the planet.

57:42.810 --> 57:44.870
Jimmy, the DA is taking the case herself

57:44.870 --> 57:46.360
to boost her political profile.

57:46.360 --> 57:47.480
She'll be merciless,

57:47.480 --> 57:49.860
and she's three fries
short of a happy meal.

57:49.860 --> 57:51.540
- I can't accept it, Kevin.

57:51.540 --> 57:55.910
- All we have to do is
convince one juror, one,

57:55.910 --> 57:57.300
that there's a reasonable doubt.

57:57.300 --> 57:59.220
These guys will do that.

57:59.220 --> 58:00.940
- There won't be any jurors.

58:00.940 --> 58:02.290
- How?

58:02.290 --> 58:03.690
- I requested a bench trial.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.800
- You're leaving this up to a judge?

58:12.120 --> 58:16.393
Look, I believe in you,
Jim, but don't test him.

58:18.070 --> 58:19.170
- I'm not testing him.

58:20.530 --> 58:21.607
I'm trusting him.

58:28.160 --> 58:29.030
- Mr. Valentino,

58:29.030 --> 58:31.790
you are charged with four
counts of manslaughter.

58:31.790 --> 58:35.220
Each case carries a maximum
sentence of 25 years.

58:35.220 --> 58:37.750
Do you understand the
charges brought against you?

58:37.750 --> 58:39.097
- Yes.

58:39.097 --> 58:40.850
- "Yes, your honor."

58:40.850 --> 58:42.410
- Yes, your honor.

58:42.410 --> 58:43.530
- Has the state informed you

58:43.530 --> 58:45.690
of your right to a public defender?

58:45.690 --> 58:46.590
- Yes, your honor.

58:47.500 --> 58:48.333
I declined.

58:52.320 --> 58:54.810
- Does the prosecution have any notices?

58:54.810 --> 58:55.643
- Yes, your honor.

58:55.643 --> 58:57.510
The state would like
to offer Mr. Valentino

58:57.510 --> 59:00.230
a reduced charge of
involuntary manslaughter

59:00.230 --> 59:02.680
with each case carrying
the maximum sentence,

59:02.680 --> 59:04.523
a total of 32 years.

59:06.570 --> 59:10.490
- Mr. Valentino, would you like
to accept the plea bargain?

59:10.490 --> 59:11.323
- No.

59:11.323 --> 59:12.630
- "No, your honor."

59:12.630 --> 59:14.690
- Sorry. No, your honor.

59:14.690 --> 59:15.523
- Okay.

59:16.370 --> 59:17.803
We'll set your trial date.

59:18.760 --> 59:20.870
Mr. Valentino, this courtroom is empty

59:20.870 --> 59:23.100
because I closed your proceedings

59:23.100 --> 59:24.210
based on information

59:24.210 --> 59:27.080
that there have been threats
made to your wellbeing.

59:27.080 --> 59:29.120
Can you confirm if that's the case?

59:29.120 --> 59:31.770
- Yes, your honor. It is.

59:31.770 --> 59:34.230
Both my wife and I have
received death threats, and-

59:34.230 --> 59:36.223
- I just needed a yes or no.

59:38.400 --> 59:41.770
Does the state have any
objection to closed proceedings?

59:41.770 --> 59:42.927
- I'm fine if it's closed
to the general pubic,

59:42.927 --> 59:46.460
but I think the media
should be allowed inside.

59:46.460 --> 59:49.097
- We're not turning this
into "The Cindy Show."

59:50.810 --> 59:52.900
- It's an important case.

59:52.900 --> 59:54.533
- I'm keeping it closed.

59:56.850 --> 59:59.100
Mr. Valentino, before the trial starts,

59:59.100 --> 1:00:01.290
I highly recommend that you reconsider

1:00:01.290 --> 1:00:03.313
your decision to defend yourself.

1:00:04.247 --> 1:00:07.623
"As God as my witness"
is not a sound strategy.

1:00:09.590 --> 1:00:10.423
Adjourned.

1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:16.473
- You should have taken the deal.

1:00:18.600 --> 1:00:19.963
I'm going to bury you now.

1:00:21.920 --> 1:00:22.980
- So they're all grouped together.

1:00:22.980 --> 1:00:24.580
It's bank accounts, insurance,

1:00:24.580 --> 1:00:27.180
utilities, and then username and password.

1:00:27.180 --> 1:00:29.903
- Jimmy, we went through
this a few months ago.

1:00:31.240 --> 1:00:33.480
- Listen, I'm not going anywhere, okay?

1:00:33.480 --> 1:00:36.030
I just want to make sure
you're prepared in case...

1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:38.470
In case something happens.

1:00:38.470 --> 1:00:42.020
- I want to make sure
that you're prepared,

1:00:42.020 --> 1:00:45.360
and I really think that we
should reconsider Kevin's offer.

1:00:45.360 --> 1:00:47.250
- No, I know what I have to do.

1:00:47.250 --> 1:00:48.083
- Really?

1:00:49.100 --> 1:00:51.113
What are you going to
say to convince them?

1:00:53.370 --> 1:00:54.884
- I'm just going to tell them the truth.

1:00:54.884 --> 1:00:57.467
(somber music)

1:01:01.297 --> 1:01:03.620
- And what led to that decline?

1:01:03.620 --> 1:01:05.770
- He refused all medication.

1:01:05.770 --> 1:01:08.960
We had him undergo a
psychological evaluation.

1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:10.920
He was deemed to be of sound mind.

1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:13.333
So, the treatment ceased.

1:01:14.730 --> 1:01:16.410
- Couldn't you have forced
the treatments on him?

1:01:16.410 --> 1:01:18.960
- Only if I wanted to
lose my medical license.

1:01:18.960 --> 1:01:20.990
- Doctor, in your
opinion, could Mr. Brooks

1:01:20.990 --> 1:01:22.740
have recovered from his illnesses?

1:01:22.740 --> 1:01:25.380
- No, he was terminal.

1:01:25.380 --> 1:01:27.270
- So, no chance whatsoever?

1:01:27.270 --> 1:01:29.790
- I mean, maybe a thousand to one.

1:01:29.790 --> 1:01:30.960
- How much longer could he have lived

1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:33.220
if he continued with his treatments?

1:01:33.220 --> 1:01:36.550
- At least a month, six weeks, maybe.

1:01:36.550 --> 1:01:38.891
- So, much longer than just the few days

1:01:38.891 --> 1:01:41.290
after meeting with Mr. Valentino.

1:01:41.290 --> 1:01:42.123
- Yes.

1:01:43.005 --> 1:01:44.230
- What was Mr. Brooks' rationale

1:01:44.230 --> 1:01:46.140
for stopping the treatments?

1:01:46.140 --> 1:01:48.113
- He thought God was going to heal him.

1:01:49.210 --> 1:01:51.110
- Why did he think that?

1:01:51.110 --> 1:01:52.690
- Because the defendant filled his head

1:01:52.690 --> 1:01:54.393
with that baseless supposition.

1:01:57.165 --> 1:01:58.165
- Thank you, doctor.

1:02:00.750 --> 1:02:03.450
- Does the defense have any
questions for the witness?

1:02:05.510 --> 1:02:06.343
- No.

1:02:06.343 --> 1:02:07.770
- "No, your honor,"

1:02:07.770 --> 1:02:10.400
and stand when you
address me, Mr. Valentino.

1:02:10.400 --> 1:02:11.233
- Sorry.

1:02:13.350 --> 1:02:14.183
No, your honor

1:02:18.746 --> 1:02:21.680
- Did Mr. Valentino ever
meet with your patient?

1:02:21.680 --> 1:02:22.890
- No.

1:02:22.890 --> 1:02:24.800
- Did she ever talk with him on the phone?

1:02:24.800 --> 1:02:26.240
- Not to my knowledge.

1:02:26.240 --> 1:02:28.670
- Then how did she learn
Mr. Valentino's techniques?

1:02:28.670 --> 1:02:30.050
- She researched them online.

1:02:30.050 --> 1:02:33.670
Her visitors would relay
stories, show her videos.

1:02:33.670 --> 1:02:36.460
- Doctor, if your patient had
continued with the treatments,

1:02:36.460 --> 1:02:38.040
could she have recovered?

1:02:38.040 --> 1:02:39.540
- Possibly.

1:02:39.540 --> 1:02:40.640
- Fully recovered?

1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:43.623
- There are similar cases that
made full recoveries, yes.

1:02:44.570 --> 1:02:47.110
Did any of them rely
on the type of schemes

1:02:47.110 --> 1:02:48.770
the defendant advocates?

1:02:48.770 --> 1:02:50.823
- No, they relied on reality.

1:02:52.740 --> 1:02:53.910
- Thank you, doctor.

1:02:53.910 --> 1:02:54.863
No more questions.

1:02:58.090 --> 1:03:01.003
- Does the defense wish to
cross-examine the witness?

1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:03.833
- Uh...

1:03:06.720 --> 1:03:07.553
No, your honor.

1:03:10.044 --> 1:03:15.044
(somber music)
(traffic roaring)

1:03:32.230 --> 1:03:35.313
(distant clattering)

1:03:40.770 --> 1:03:42.853
- My sister was quite religious.

1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:46.583
She went to church regularly,

1:03:47.770 --> 1:03:49.870
and she believed
everything that she'd heard

1:03:49.870 --> 1:03:51.190
about the defendant,

1:03:51.190 --> 1:03:54.443
and that if he could do it, anyone could.

1:03:55.590 --> 1:03:58.903
She couldn't, and she died because of it.

1:04:00.330 --> 1:04:03.880
- And what other issues arose
from your sister's death?

1:04:03.880 --> 1:04:06.193
- She hadn't done any estate planning.

1:04:07.280 --> 1:04:10.430
My sister was a successful business woman,

1:04:10.430 --> 1:04:13.600
Ivy League educated, single.

1:04:13.600 --> 1:04:14.740
She was worth a lot of money,

1:04:14.740 --> 1:04:16.250
and now we are fighting
with the government

1:04:16.250 --> 1:04:18.510
about how much they're going to take.

1:04:18.510 --> 1:04:20.483
- Thank you. No more questions.

1:04:22.670 --> 1:04:24.920
Father, are you familiar
with the Bible passage

1:04:24.920 --> 1:04:27.810
Mr. Valentino cites
regarding his alleged ability

1:04:27.810 --> 1:04:29.520
to help others through God?

1:04:29.520 --> 1:04:31.513
- Yes, John 14:12.

1:04:38.537 --> 1:04:40.270
- "Very truly, I tell you,

1:04:40.270 --> 1:04:43.960
whoever believes in me will do
the works I have been doing,

1:04:43.960 --> 1:04:46.500
and they will do even
greater things than these

1:04:46.500 --> 1:04:48.847
because I am going to the Father."

1:04:50.230 --> 1:04:51.063
Is that it?

1:04:51.063 --> 1:04:51.920
- Yes.

1:04:51.920 --> 1:04:54.230
- Can you explain its
meaning to the court?

1:04:54.230 --> 1:04:57.630
- This was Jesus speaking to the apostles.

1:04:57.630 --> 1:05:00.010
They, of course, had
witnessed his miracles,

1:05:00.010 --> 1:05:02.680
and he's explaining that they
could also perform miracles,

1:05:02.680 --> 1:05:04.700
miracles even greater than his,

1:05:04.700 --> 1:05:07.500
because he would ask the
Father to deliver them.

1:05:07.500 --> 1:05:09.723
- And the Father is omnipotent.

1:05:10.630 --> 1:05:14.203
- Imagine Jesus's power
magnified exponentially.

1:05:15.090 --> 1:05:17.860
- And is that the mindset,
the method you employed,

1:05:17.860 --> 1:05:19.733
on your visits with Gloria McGregor?

1:05:20.600 --> 1:05:21.433
- It is.

1:05:23.220 --> 1:05:25.220
- Oh, why couldn't you save her, father?

1:05:26.930 --> 1:05:28.830
- How do we know I didn't save her?

1:05:28.830 --> 1:05:30.833
- Well, she's dead.

1:05:33.520 --> 1:05:36.750
- Jesus wasn't speaking
to his apostles about

1:05:36.750 --> 1:05:38.940
curing the sick, raising the dead,

1:05:38.940 --> 1:05:40.733
or turning water into wine.

1:05:41.710 --> 1:05:44.560
He was referring to the
greatest miracle of all.

1:05:44.560 --> 1:05:46.790
- [Prosector] And what's that, father?

1:05:46.790 --> 1:05:47.890
- Converting a sinner.

1:05:49.330 --> 1:05:51.350
If you can save someone
from the fury of hell

1:05:51.350 --> 1:05:54.220
and give that person
eternal life in heaven,

1:05:54.220 --> 1:05:56.320
then you have performed His greatest deed.

1:05:57.280 --> 1:06:00.590
- So, Mr. Valentino's
interpretation of the passage,

1:06:00.590 --> 1:06:05.410
that he can call on God for
whatever he wants, is misguided.

1:06:05.410 --> 1:06:06.890
That's not its intent?

1:06:06.890 --> 1:06:07.740
- That's correct.

1:06:09.010 --> 1:06:11.673
Otherwise, we'd all be flying
around in private jets.

1:06:14.160 --> 1:06:16.230
- How long have you been a priest, father?

1:06:16.230 --> 1:06:17.630
- Over 30 years.

1:06:17.630 --> 1:06:18.710
- Thank you, father.

1:06:18.710 --> 1:06:19.610
No more questions.

1:06:22.050 --> 1:06:23.053
- Any questions?

1:06:28.080 --> 1:06:28.913
- Father,

1:06:30.690 --> 1:06:32.410
do you believe that God put us here

1:06:32.410 --> 1:06:34.760
so that we could all be
flying in private jets?

1:06:36.215 --> 1:06:38.293
- Objection, irrelevant.

1:06:40.140 --> 1:06:41.643
- You don't have to answer that.

1:06:46.940 --> 1:06:48.460
- [Prosecutor] We've rested our case.

1:06:48.460 --> 1:06:49.720
The defense hasn't notified the state

1:06:49.720 --> 1:06:51.770
of any witnesses they plan to call.

1:06:51.770 --> 1:06:53.670
- [Reporter] If there
are no further witnesses,

1:06:53.670 --> 1:06:55.090
when could we expect a verdict?

1:06:55.090 --> 1:06:56.890
- [Prosecutor] It could be tomorrow.

1:06:56.890 --> 1:06:58.440
I'll give an update either way.

1:06:59.810 --> 1:07:00.803
- No witnesses?

1:07:01.810 --> 1:07:02.860
- Just me.

1:07:02.860 --> 1:07:04.080
- What about Angela?

1:07:04.080 --> 1:07:05.300
She'd melt their hearts.

1:07:05.300 --> 1:07:07.540
- She's been through enough already.

1:07:07.540 --> 1:07:09.519
Imagine what that viper would do to her.

1:07:09.519 --> 1:07:12.102
(somber music)

1:07:49.977 --> 1:07:52.560
(upbeat music)

1:07:54.980 --> 1:07:56.740
- Kids, are you almost ready for school?

1:07:56.740 --> 1:07:57.573
- [Kids] Yes!

1:07:59.370 --> 1:08:00.743
- How are the waffles?

1:08:00.743 --> 1:08:01.910
- [Kids] Good!

1:08:05.699 --> 1:08:07.423
- All right, come here. Give me hugs.

1:08:10.466 --> 1:08:12.831
Come here, big guy.

1:08:12.831 --> 1:08:14.170
- When are you coming home?

1:08:14.170 --> 1:08:15.003
- Early.

1:08:15.003 --> 1:08:16.510
- Okay, you guys. Get in the car.

1:08:16.510 --> 1:08:18.020
I'll be right there.

1:08:18.020 --> 1:08:18.853
- Bye.

1:08:18.853 --> 1:08:20.373
- Bye, guys. Have a good day.

1:08:22.090 --> 1:08:23.973
- What do I tell them
if you don't come home?

1:08:27.300 --> 1:08:28.200
- I'm coming home.

1:08:29.760 --> 1:08:31.693
- I'll be there as soon as I can.

1:08:31.693 --> 1:08:32.526
- I love you.

1:08:32.526 --> 1:08:33.393
- I love you too.

1:08:35.203 --> 1:08:36.763
Be strong. Be convincing.

1:08:38.790 --> 1:08:39.623
- Bye-bye.

1:08:53.289 --> 1:08:56.039
(water burbling)

1:09:07.051 --> 1:09:09.718
(gentle music)

1:09:21.800 --> 1:09:24.930
I would never have
considered myself obsessive,

1:09:24.930 --> 1:09:28.890
but after what happened,

1:09:28.890 --> 1:09:31.560
all the things I had heard
and then learned about,

1:09:31.560 --> 1:09:34.410
but never really thought
about in great detail,

1:09:34.410 --> 1:09:35.760
it all just sort of hit me,

1:09:36.630 --> 1:09:40.093
and things became a lot clearer.

1:09:41.500 --> 1:09:43.970
- The slow motion episodes you mentioned?

1:09:43.970 --> 1:09:44.803
- That's right.

1:09:46.250 --> 1:09:49.920
- So, I took it to heart.

1:09:49.920 --> 1:09:53.620
I decided that this was real
and I just vowed to share it

1:09:53.620 --> 1:09:55.860
with anyone who asked.

1:09:55.860 --> 1:09:58.120
Honestly, your honor, after Angela Ramos,

1:09:58.120 --> 1:10:00.710
I just wanted my life to
get back to normal, but...

1:10:02.390 --> 1:10:03.943
It became bigger than me.

1:10:05.940 --> 1:10:10.790
When your life's put at
risk, really at risk,

1:10:10.790 --> 1:10:12.083
you take inventory,

1:10:14.870 --> 1:10:17.680
and you wonder if what
you've dedicated your life to

1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:19.043
is actually worth it.

1:10:21.060 --> 1:10:25.183
Every day, I say to myself,
assuming it doesn't come back,

1:10:26.500 --> 1:10:29.363
getting cancer was the best
thing that ever happened to me.

1:10:30.200 --> 1:10:31.033
I hated it.

1:10:32.290 --> 1:10:35.120
The pain was excruciating at points.

1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:37.020
Having radioactive medicine

1:10:37.020 --> 1:10:38.850
pumped into your veins is terrifying,

1:10:38.850 --> 1:10:42.520
but if going through
that and all the needles

1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:45.130
and all the anxiety is what

1:10:45.130 --> 1:10:47.270
got me to help just one person, then...

1:10:50.423 --> 1:10:52.243
Then I understand why I suffered,

1:10:54.430 --> 1:10:56.550
and I haven't suffered nearly as much

1:10:56.550 --> 1:11:00.610
as so many other people, but I knew that

1:11:00.610 --> 1:11:02.981
if I didn't try to help them,

1:11:02.981 --> 1:11:04.681
then I would have died, wondering,

1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:07.860
what would have happened if I had?

1:11:12.170 --> 1:11:13.970
- If people made decisions

1:11:13.970 --> 1:11:15.560
based on what they learned from me,

1:11:15.560 --> 1:11:17.810
and that ended up being
detrimental to their health,

1:11:17.810 --> 1:11:21.783
I feel very, very bad about that.

1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:29.173
I'm not sure that I can
be held accountable,

1:11:31.680 --> 1:11:32.513
because...

1:11:33.390 --> 1:11:35.293
Only their faith could save them.

1:11:37.260 --> 1:11:38.093
Not mine.

1:11:41.730 --> 1:11:42.730
- That's everything?

1:11:43.760 --> 1:11:44.710
- That's the truth.

1:11:46.660 --> 1:11:47.493
- Cindy?

1:11:48.840 --> 1:11:51.723
- Mr. Valentino, were you sent
by God to heal the people?

1:11:52.900 --> 1:11:53.733
- I don't know.

1:11:53.733 --> 1:11:55.079
- Are you a prophet?

1:11:55.079 --> 1:11:55.930
- I don't know.

1:11:55.930 --> 1:11:58.650
- Well, you said you talked to God.

1:11:58.650 --> 1:12:00.250
Doesn't that make you a prophet?

1:12:01.210 --> 1:12:02.830
- I don't know.

1:12:02.830 --> 1:12:05.130
- Can the techniques you
just described to the court

1:12:05.130 --> 1:12:06.730
work on anyone?

1:12:06.730 --> 1:12:08.430
- I believe they can.

1:12:08.430 --> 1:12:10.080
- Then why are these people dead?

1:12:13.150 --> 1:12:16.610
- Derek Brooks never believed
that he could be saved.

1:12:16.610 --> 1:12:17.443
- What about the others?

1:12:17.443 --> 1:12:20.261
- I don't know. I wasn't there.

1:12:20.261 --> 1:12:21.980
- Well, I thought you
said anyone can do it.

1:12:21.980 --> 1:12:23.610
That's what's in the scripture you quote.

1:12:23.610 --> 1:12:25.640
Are you saying these people would be alive

1:12:25.640 --> 1:12:26.803
if you were there?

1:12:31.320 --> 1:12:32.153
- Maybe.

1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:38.630
- Mr. Valentino, have you received

1:12:38.630 --> 1:12:42.849
any payments or gifts for
your visits with these people?

1:12:42.849 --> 1:12:44.943
- No.

1:12:44.943 --> 1:12:46.657
- No?
- No.

1:12:47.810 --> 1:12:48.643
- Hmm.

1:12:51.230 --> 1:12:52.710
The state has records of

1:12:52.710 --> 1:12:55.080
at least 10 gift baskets being delivered,

1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:57.540
over $400 in gift cards.

1:12:57.540 --> 1:13:00.507
Are you sure you haven't
received anything.

1:13:00.507 --> 1:13:02.660
- Those are just thank yous.

1:13:02.660 --> 1:13:03.740
Their value is negligible.

1:13:03.740 --> 1:13:06.920
I lost my job, I lost my health insurance,

1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:07.980
my retirement-

1:13:07.980 --> 1:13:10.230
- Just answer the question.

1:13:10.230 --> 1:13:12.933
Did you receive any type of reward?

1:13:15.290 --> 1:13:16.123
- Yes.

1:13:18.650 --> 1:13:22.550
- Mr. Valentino, you quit
your job, isn't that right?

1:13:22.550 --> 1:13:23.383
- That's right.

1:13:23.383 --> 1:13:24.610
- An executive level job.

1:13:24.610 --> 1:13:26.810
You were company officer, correct?

1:13:26.810 --> 1:13:28.180
- Correct.

1:13:28.180 --> 1:13:29.210
- And what was the value

1:13:29.210 --> 1:13:31.253
of the unvested stock you forfeited?

1:13:32.890 --> 1:13:34.963
- Almost $2 million.

1:13:38.557 --> 1:13:39.423
- $2 million.

1:13:42.544 --> 1:13:44.894
How did you plan on
maintaining your lifestyle?

1:13:46.090 --> 1:13:47.573
- I didn't think about it.

1:13:48.580 --> 1:13:49.980
- You didn't think about it?

1:13:50.950 --> 1:13:53.550
- You're friends with Kevin
Flynn, isn't that right?

1:13:54.470 --> 1:13:55.303
- Yes.

1:13:56.240 --> 1:13:57.293
- How'd you meet him?

1:13:59.550 --> 1:14:00.550
- I helped his wife.

1:14:01.440 --> 1:14:03.070
- Did you know that Mr. Flynn's estate

1:14:03.070 --> 1:14:05.163
is worth north of $400 million?

1:14:06.600 --> 1:14:08.100
- No, I did not.

1:14:08.100 --> 1:14:08.933
- Hmm.

1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:13.690
Did he offer to repay you
if you helped his wife?

1:14:13.690 --> 1:14:16.520
- Probably, he did, but
I didn't accept anything.

1:14:16.520 --> 1:14:17.920
- Did he offer to pay for your legal team?

1:14:17.920 --> 1:14:19.950
- Yeah, he did, but what does that matter?

1:14:19.950 --> 1:14:21.190
I obviously refused it.

1:14:21.190 --> 1:14:23.200
- Well, I'm just wondering how
much he's going to offer you

1:14:23.200 --> 1:14:24.350
when the trial is over,

1:14:24.350 --> 1:14:26.050
and if you'll refuse that too,

1:14:26.050 --> 1:14:29.800
knowing it can no longer be
used against you in court.

1:14:29.800 --> 1:14:31.763
- What, you think that I planned this?

1:14:34.150 --> 1:14:35.750
- No more questions, your honor.

1:14:37.760 --> 1:14:38.890
- You're excused.

1:14:38.890 --> 1:14:41.400
Wait downstairs. We'll reconvene at three.

1:14:41.400 --> 1:14:43.463
Be prepared with closing statements.

1:14:44.621 --> 1:14:47.121
(gavel bangs)

1:14:48.720 --> 1:14:49.620
- School was good?

1:14:50.580 --> 1:14:52.681
- Scarlett got the Anna roll.

1:14:52.681 --> 1:14:54.140
- Is she nervous?

1:14:54.140 --> 1:14:55.276
- Scarlett?

1:14:55.276 --> 1:14:58.276
(footsteps echoing)

1:15:07.496 --> 1:15:09.460
There are a lot of people out there.

1:15:09.460 --> 1:15:10.503
A lot of cameras.

1:15:18.400 --> 1:15:19.780
- All right.

1:15:19.780 --> 1:15:21.697
Time for me to find out.

1:15:22.548 --> 1:15:23.848
- You're going to be fine.

1:15:35.240 --> 1:15:36.073
- I love you.

1:15:36.992 --> 1:15:38.075
- I love you.

1:15:42.620 --> 1:15:43.743
- I'll be back, okay?

1:15:56.478 --> 1:15:59.228
(phone clicking)

1:16:01.080 --> 1:16:05.490
- Your honor, I'm not sure who
Mr. Valentino thinks he is,

1:16:05.490 --> 1:16:08.193
but I can tell you that
he is no miracle worker.

1:16:09.500 --> 1:16:12.180
The problem is he pretended to be one,

1:16:12.180 --> 1:16:15.440
and now, four people's
lives were cut short.

1:16:15.440 --> 1:16:17.650
Some significantly,

1:16:17.650 --> 1:16:19.920
and who knows how many
others out there died

1:16:19.920 --> 1:16:21.363
trying this absurdity?

1:16:22.730 --> 1:16:27.730
The notoriety he received
from this was incredible.

1:16:27.950 --> 1:16:32.020
Millions of views and likes and followers,

1:16:32.020 --> 1:16:33.830
and conning everyone into believing

1:16:33.830 --> 1:16:36.073
he is a savior on Earth,

1:16:39.190 --> 1:16:41.450
and he left a gold mine
of a job to do this.

1:16:41.450 --> 1:16:43.210
(ominous music)

1:16:43.210 --> 1:16:44.760
Surely, there was a plan

1:16:44.760 --> 1:16:47.103
to make this all back and then some.

1:16:49.220 --> 1:16:51.943
Maybe he was planning
on starting a ministry.

1:16:52.930 --> 1:16:55.740
Make millions in tax-free dollars.

1:16:55.740 --> 1:16:59.450
Now, there's nothing illegal
or even wrong with that.

1:16:59.450 --> 1:17:03.060
Many people have done it, and
their followers love them.

1:17:03.060 --> 1:17:04.340
Love what they stand for.

1:17:04.340 --> 1:17:06.313
They want them in their lives.

1:17:09.440 --> 1:17:14.440
The difference is, this
defendant's followers died.

1:17:16.580 --> 1:17:19.920
He took his scam to a level of arrogance

1:17:19.920 --> 1:17:24.263
even the most brazen criminals
would have found offensive.

1:17:26.530 --> 1:17:28.180
Thousands of priests have tried to

1:17:28.180 --> 1:17:33.180
heal others in God's name and
couldn't, for 2,000 years.

1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:36.263
Bishops, popes.

1:17:37.640 --> 1:17:42.093
The hubris Mr. Valentino
displayed, the pride, the greed,

1:17:43.010 --> 1:17:44.890
pretending that he could channel God

1:17:44.890 --> 1:17:47.983
and convincing others that
they could do the same,

1:17:49.260 --> 1:17:52.573
is the reason these people
are no longer living.

1:17:53.680 --> 1:17:55.573
The only reason.

1:18:00.241 --> 1:18:03.333
- Does the defense wish to
make any closing arguments?

1:18:11.890 --> 1:18:12.740
- No, your honor.

1:18:14.620 --> 1:18:15.573
- Remain standing.

1:18:19.070 --> 1:18:19.903
- Mr. Valentino,

1:18:19.903 --> 1:18:22.740
based on the evidence
put forth by the state,

1:18:22.740 --> 1:18:26.950
and frankly, the scarcity of
the evidence from the defense,

1:18:26.950 --> 1:18:29.800
I had a very difficult time finding a path

1:18:29.800 --> 1:18:32.800
to reasonable doubt in this case.

1:18:32.800 --> 1:18:34.930
I do not believe that
you intentionally set out

1:18:34.930 --> 1:18:37.040
to harm these people,

1:18:37.040 --> 1:18:39.070
but if it wasn't for your guidance,

1:18:39.070 --> 1:18:41.170
either directly or indirectly,

1:18:41.170 --> 1:18:43.453
some of them would still be alive.

1:18:44.370 --> 1:18:47.080
Therefore, I'm reducing the
charges from manslaughter

1:18:47.080 --> 1:18:49.583
to involuntary manslaughter,

1:18:50.800 --> 1:18:52.290
and Mr. Valentino,

1:18:52.290 --> 1:18:54.640
I find you guilty of this
charge on all counts.

1:18:57.850 --> 1:19:00.280
Each count carries a
minimum sentence of one year

1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:02.093
and a maximum sentence of eight.

1:19:03.030 --> 1:19:07.870
Does the prosecution have any
sentencing recommendations?

1:19:07.870 --> 1:19:09.350
- Yes, your honor.

1:19:09.350 --> 1:19:12.870
- The state recommends the
maximum sentence in each case.

1:19:12.870 --> 1:19:14.130
We can not subject others

1:19:14.130 --> 1:19:16.233
to Mr. Valentino's deceitfulness.

1:19:17.380 --> 1:19:19.960
More importantly, the
families of these victims

1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:22.360
are going to suffer for
the rest of their lives.

1:19:25.710 --> 1:19:27.733
The punishment has to be commensurate.

1:19:33.940 --> 1:19:36.990
- Mr. Valentino, is there
anything you'd like to say?

1:19:36.990 --> 1:19:40.893
Any request for leniency,
prior to hearing my decision?

1:19:43.530 --> 1:19:44.690
Very well.

1:19:44.690 --> 1:19:48.970
Mr. Valentino, based on
the evidence and arguments

1:19:48.970 --> 1:19:52.330
presented to me, I hear by sentence you-

1:19:52.330 --> 1:19:57.330
(heart beating)
(ominous music)

1:20:13.859 --> 1:20:17.276
(otherworldly whooshing)

1:20:22.672 --> 1:20:25.839
(building clattering)

1:20:40.136 --> 1:20:43.053
(distant rumbling)

1:20:46.222 --> 1:20:49.472
(furniture clattering)

1:21:09.560 --> 1:21:12.310
- Your honor, the state would
like to drop all charges.

1:21:17.360 --> 1:21:18.193
Forgive me.

1:21:21.230 --> 1:21:22.153
- Mr. Valentino.

1:21:24.410 --> 1:21:26.990
I'd like to apologize
for my conduct, and...

1:21:28.460 --> 1:21:30.253
May God have mercy on my soul.

1:21:31.520 --> 1:21:32.993
Your case is dismissed.

1:21:37.110 --> 1:21:39.560
- You can't tell anyone about this.

1:21:42.380 --> 1:21:43.213
No one.

1:21:44.118 --> 1:21:46.701
(upbeat music)

1:22:01.478 --> 1:22:04.708
(peaceful music)

1:22:04.708 --> 1:22:07.541
(family laughing)

1:22:10.800 --> 1:22:14.960
- My father dedicated the
last 40 years of his existence

1:22:14.960 --> 1:22:17.560
to helping people who were
fighting for their lives.

1:22:18.740 --> 1:22:20.193
Praying for their lives,

1:22:21.240 --> 1:22:23.640
when they realized nothing
else could save them.

1:22:26.410 --> 1:22:27.773
The world needed my father.

1:22:33.245 --> 1:22:36.320
And he willingly accepted his obligation.

1:22:36.320 --> 1:22:39.153
(emotional music)

1:22:52.160 --> 1:22:55.450
Sparing the faithful from an early death

1:22:56.570 --> 1:22:57.963
became his life's work,

1:22:59.320 --> 1:23:00.493
and he did it humbly,

1:23:01.480 --> 1:23:03.813
always giving credit
to God, never himself.

1:23:07.280 --> 1:23:10.323
My father died without a
penny left to his name.

1:23:12.780 --> 1:23:16.965
He sacrificed for what he
believed was his calling.

1:23:16.965 --> 1:23:19.798
(emotional music)

1:23:26.756 --> 1:23:29.900
And the question everyone asks us is,

1:23:29.900 --> 1:23:30.943
was it worth it?

1:23:32.123 --> 1:23:34.706
(somber music)

1:23:55.977 --> 1:23:57.383
- You're his messenger.

1:24:04.965 --> 1:24:08.270
(Scarlett sighs)

1:24:08.270 --> 1:24:09.863
Your quest is over now, dad.

1:24:10.947 --> 1:24:13.697
(dramatic music)

1:24:16.370 --> 1:24:18.580
We hope you found what
you've been seeking.

1:24:25.960 --> 1:24:28.003
- Rise. Don't be afraid.

1:24:33.249 --> 1:24:34.666
You've done well.

1:24:36.030 --> 1:24:37.798
You've done well.

1:24:37.798 --> 1:24:39.447
My Father is very pleased.

1:24:45.850 --> 1:24:46.683
- Thank you.

1:24:55.500 --> 1:24:56.900
- Are you ready to meet him?

1:24:59.142 --> 1:25:02.642
