00:00.272 --> 00:01.705
Previously, on Beyond...

00:01.740 --> 00:02.906
While you were in your coma

00:02.941 --> 00:05.001
your mind traveled to another world.

00:05.001 --> 00:06.676
This is where we met.
I call it The Realm.

00:06.712 --> 00:08.778
Am I the first girl to be brought
up to your bedroom?

00:08.814 --> 00:10.981
One of the gazillion things
I missed was...

00:11.016 --> 00:12.716
hanging out with girls.

00:12.751 --> 00:15.151
Hollow Sky has been involved
in youth-based charities.

00:15.187 --> 00:16.786
Fort Reed Helping Hands.

00:16.822 --> 00:18.822
It's run by Pastor Ian Brachman.

00:18.857 --> 00:20.390
Our son's friend was murdered.

00:20.425 --> 00:23.059
Now, I'm not saying that this Hollow
Sky was directly responsible,

00:23.095 --> 00:24.794
but there's got to be a connection.

00:24.830 --> 00:25.829
I'll see what I can do.

00:25.864 --> 00:28.798
Charlie Singer? I wanna help you.

00:28.834 --> 00:29.866
Mm-mm.

00:29.902 --> 00:31.968
I need something from you first.

00:32.003 --> 00:34.137
It's not her! It's not your mother.

00:34.172 --> 00:35.839
He's seeing what he wants to see.

00:35.874 --> 00:37.707
- Now what?
- Blow up the bridge.

One...

01:05.003 --> 01:06.002
two...

01:06.038 --> 01:07.137
three...

01:07.172 --> 01:08.672
four...

01:13.178 --> 01:14.778
One...

01:14.813 --> 01:16.012
two...

01:18.183 --> 01:20.684
Andrew, get up.

01:20.719 --> 01:22.085
You have to get up right now
and come with me.

01:22.120 --> 01:24.754
We'll be safe in the shelter.

01:24.790 --> 01:26.957
Safe from what?

01:26.992 --> 01:28.892
Hang on to me, son.

01:38.904 --> 01:40.804
Keep your head down, okay?

01:40.839 --> 01:42.706
We're almost there.

01:42.741 --> 01:45.108
You're doing good. You're doing so good.

02:10.102 --> 02:11.968
I'm sorry, son. I...

02:35.127 --> 02:36.793
Dad?

02:41.033 --> 02:42.098
Dad?

02:43.935 --> 02:44.901
Dad!

02:46.038 --> 02:47.103
Dad!

03:05.791 --> 03:07.891
Dad!

03:17.836 --> 03:19.836
This one's nice.

03:19.871 --> 03:20.937
Check it out,

03:20.972 --> 03:22.839
my feet don't even touch the end.

03:22.874 --> 03:24.674
It's like I'm at a hotel.

03:24.710 --> 03:26.076
Will this even fit?

03:26.111 --> 03:27.777
Of course it will fit.

03:27.813 --> 03:29.045
I mean through the door.

03:29.081 --> 03:30.714
Well, it comes in pieces,

03:30.749 --> 03:32.115
then you assemble it
when you get in the room.

03:32.150 --> 03:34.084
I-I figured.

03:34.119 --> 03:35.819
It's sturdy.

03:35.854 --> 03:37.053
Hey, excuse me.

03:37.089 --> 03:39.923
Is this wood imported
or locally sourced?

03:39.958 --> 03:41.925
It's got to be imported, right?

03:42.961 --> 03:44.828
Costs next to nothing.

03:45.897 --> 03:47.097
- I like it.
- Yeah?

03:47.132 --> 03:49.165
Yeah, I think this is the one.

03:49.201 --> 03:52.736
The... Oh, the...

03:52.771 --> 03:54.938
"Slutligen Droemmer."

03:54.973 --> 03:56.973
Okay.

04:00.812 --> 04:02.011
- Oh...
- Mom?

04:02.047 --> 04:03.880
I'm fine.

04:03.915 --> 04:05.982
I'm fine, I'm fine,
I'm fine, I'm fine...

04:06.017 --> 04:08.017
Mom, it's... it's all right.

04:08.053 --> 04:10.086
It's just a bed.

04:11.156 --> 04:13.056
It's not just a bed, Holden,

04:13.091 --> 04:14.824
it's your bed.

04:14.860 --> 04:15.859
Hmm.

04:15.894 --> 04:18.762
We bought you that bed
when you were three.

04:18.797 --> 04:21.664
- You remember, right?
- Yeah.

04:21.700 --> 04:23.933
It was your big boy bed.

04:23.969 --> 04:25.101
Hm.

04:25.137 --> 04:28.004
I tucked you in before
the first day of school

04:28.039 --> 04:31.040
and I curled up beside you
when you had a bad dream.

04:34.946 --> 04:36.813
I slept in the bed when...

04:36.848 --> 04:40.171
you were in the hospital,
so it's not just about...

04:41.753 --> 04:43.820
We're good here, thank you.

04:43.855 --> 04:46.055
Mom, we don't have to
get rid of the bed.

04:46.091 --> 04:48.124
I can stay in the basement with Luke.

04:49.961 --> 04:51.928
No. No.

04:51.963 --> 04:53.730
No.

04:53.765 --> 04:56.679
It's time for us to start
thinking of you as an adult.

04:58.036 --> 05:00.670
I get it. It's hard for her to move on,

05:00.705 --> 05:01.871
but we are moving on.

05:03.675 --> 05:06.042
I've been awake for almost
two months now.

05:06.077 --> 05:07.644
I can't just be stuck in the past.

05:07.679 --> 05:08.878
I need to be able to have a life.

05:08.914 --> 05:10.713
You do have a life.

05:10.749 --> 05:12.882
Well, I want your life.

05:12.918 --> 05:15.819
You want to slave over
caramel macchiatos

05:15.854 --> 05:16.953
at the Shangri-Latte?

05:16.988 --> 05:19.055
No. I don't know, maybe.

05:19.090 --> 05:20.857
You know, I want the...

05:20.892 --> 05:23.726
freedom to figure things out on my
own, like a normal 25-year-old.

05:23.762 --> 05:25.094
You're not a normal 25-year-old.

05:25.130 --> 05:27.130
And telling yourself otherwise
doesn't make it so.

05:27.165 --> 05:28.865
It makes you delusional.

05:29.935 --> 05:32.068
Look, I'm sorry, man, but it's true.

05:34.840 --> 05:36.906
I mean, I'll be lucky

05:36.942 --> 05:38.875
if I make shift supervisor
in, like, two months.

05:38.910 --> 05:40.710
Like, that's my win.

05:40.745 --> 05:42.846
But you, you take this job with Dad,

05:42.881 --> 05:44.047
when you could be out there...

05:44.082 --> 05:46.783
making a real difference,
you know, like, helping people.

05:46.818 --> 05:47.951
I get it.

05:47.986 --> 05:50.086
With great power, blah, blah, blah.

05:50.121 --> 05:51.855
But Willa is safe.

05:51.890 --> 05:54.757
You, Mom, Dad, we're all safe.

05:54.793 --> 05:56.926
I'm done with these powers.

05:59.030 --> 06:01.631
I just, I don't want
to make a difference.

06:02.767 --> 06:03.900
All I want...

06:03.935 --> 06:05.835
is a bed that fits.

06:05.871 --> 06:07.737
Yeah.

06:07.772 --> 06:09.806
I think we can do that.

06:22.787 --> 06:24.805
I don't understand what the holdup is.

06:24.805 --> 06:25.822
They've had your truck for a month.

06:25.857 --> 06:27.757
They're still waiting on a part.

06:27.792 --> 06:28.958
A distributor, I think.

06:28.994 --> 06:30.860
A distributor. I can go down to Harry's,

06:30.896 --> 06:32.829
pick up a distributor and
be back in time for dessert.

06:32.864 --> 06:34.864
Well, Colorado's
a long way from Harry's.

06:34.900 --> 06:36.900
What's the name of this place?
I want to follow up.

06:37.936 --> 06:39.736
Yeah, it's, uh...

06:39.771 --> 06:41.704
the um...

06:41.740 --> 06:43.740
You know, it's not just the distributor.

06:43.775 --> 06:45.675
It's the rotor,

06:45.710 --> 06:46.743
and the cap,

06:46.778 --> 06:47.877
one of the pistons is broken,

06:47.913 --> 06:49.078
and it needs a new crankshaft.

06:49.114 --> 06:51.915
Good God, Holden, how much
is all this gonna cost?

06:51.950 --> 06:53.917
You don't give them a nickel
until I get in touch,

06:53.952 --> 06:54.951
all right?

06:54.986 --> 06:57.887
Speaking of... out of touch,

06:57.923 --> 07:00.023
Pastor Ian's been noticeably absent.

07:01.726 --> 07:02.959
Is he on, like,
some kind of pilgrimage...

07:02.994 --> 07:04.727
Luke. Come on, man.

07:04.763 --> 07:06.863
What? I'm just asking if they broke up.

07:10.101 --> 07:12.101
Not that it's any
of your business, but we...

07:12.137 --> 07:14.637
Pastor Ian is out
of the picture for now.

07:14.673 --> 07:16.105
That's all you need to know.

07:16.141 --> 07:19.075
It's getting late. I should get going.

07:20.745 --> 07:22.912
I'll give you a ride home.

07:22.948 --> 07:24.814
Okay, the dishwasher is empty.

07:24.849 --> 07:25.982
I will leave the pans in the sink.

07:26.017 --> 07:27.917
I'll do them when I get home.

07:27.953 --> 07:29.052
Okay?

07:29.087 --> 07:31.988
I'll see you tomorrow
at 8:00 a.m., sharp.

07:33.725 --> 07:35.992
Getting rides from the boss.

07:36.027 --> 07:37.794
Making a lot of friends at work?

07:37.829 --> 07:39.787
Maybe if you taught me
how to make those adorable

07:39.787 --> 07:40.831
little hearts in their coffees.

07:40.832 --> 07:42.065
It's called latte art.

07:42.100 --> 07:43.733
Oh.

07:57.749 --> 07:58.881
There he is.

08:01.019 --> 08:03.686
Diane, Tom.

08:03.722 --> 08:04.821
Thanks for the call, Sheriff.

08:04.856 --> 08:06.622
Yeah, it's just John, for now.

08:07.659 --> 08:08.891
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:09.995 --> 08:11.995
This is, uh, Special Agent Gale...

08:12.030 --> 08:14.630
Gale Borden. Kansas City Field office.

08:14.666 --> 08:15.832
Hi.

08:15.867 --> 08:17.834
- You're FBI?
- That's right.

08:19.704 --> 08:23.673
I'd like to talk to you both
about Hollow Sky.

08:29.892 --> 08:33.009
Wow. That's an "S."

08:33.616 --> 08:36.217
Hey, it helps to keep your eyes open...

08:36.253 --> 08:37.586
when you shoot at the net.

08:37.621 --> 08:39.520
- Does it?
- Yeah.

08:39.556 --> 08:41.657
All right, off-the-backboard net.

08:44.328 --> 08:45.327
Whoo!

08:48.699 --> 08:51.466
You didn't think Mom and Dad
seemed a little... off?

08:52.569 --> 08:53.702
Off?

08:53.737 --> 08:56.371
When was the last time
Mom offered to drive Dad home?

08:56.407 --> 08:59.341
Dude, Mom doesn't even know
I got kicked out of school.

09:00.644 --> 09:03.245
Yeah, I keep my distance.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.380
Hey, it's your shot, Space Jam.

09:13.657 --> 09:16.191
Come on, you don't think that...

09:19.363 --> 09:21.630
Dude, that was, like, a month ago.

09:23.400 --> 09:26.301
If Hollow Sky was coming for us, they...

09:26.337 --> 09:28.236
would've come for us.

09:28.272 --> 09:31.239
It's not Hollow Sky.
It's something else.

09:31.275 --> 09:32.574
A feeling.

09:34.278 --> 09:36.311
Like when you forget
to unplug the toaster.

09:37.348 --> 09:40.282
Well, did you forget
to unplug the toaster?

09:41.585 --> 09:43.685
Forget it. It's nothing.

09:43.721 --> 09:46.355
My shot?

09:46.390 --> 09:48.223
Yeah.

09:49.560 --> 09:51.226
Oh!

09:51.261 --> 09:53.261
That is "HORSE."

09:53.297 --> 09:54.629
All right, I'm going inside. You coming?

09:54.665 --> 09:56.631
I think I could use the practice.

09:56.667 --> 09:58.567
Right.

10:03.307 --> 10:04.639
Hey, Holden.

10:04.675 --> 10:07.542
Bend your knees
right before you release.

10:09.480 --> 10:11.380
Yeah.

11:18.415 --> 11:20.482
I just had it!

11:21.518 --> 11:23.285
Okay, I got another one.

11:23.320 --> 11:24.719
I'm sorry, this is embarrassing.

11:24.755 --> 11:26.655
Hi, excuse me.

11:28.292 --> 11:30.559
Do you happen to have a spare...

11:32.396 --> 11:34.529
Yes! Superb. Thank you.

11:34.565 --> 11:36.531
Agent Borden has been looking into

11:36.567 --> 11:38.633
some missing persons across Kansas.

11:38.669 --> 11:40.335
Nine.

11:40.370 --> 11:41.436
Nine missing.

11:41.472 --> 11:43.672
All of them diverse in age,

11:43.707 --> 11:46.274
race, gender, religion.

11:46.310 --> 11:48.610
Nothing to suggest
that these cases are connected,

11:48.645 --> 11:50.712
save one...

11:50.747 --> 11:53.281
noteworthy point of intersection.

11:54.518 --> 11:55.684
Helping Hands?

11:55.719 --> 11:58.620
You were in a relationship
with Pastor Ian Brachman,

11:58.655 --> 11:59.754
is that correct?

11:59.790 --> 12:01.389
Correct.

12:01.425 --> 12:03.325
How long?

12:05.395 --> 12:07.395
Six or...

12:07.431 --> 12:08.530
no, seven months.

12:08.565 --> 12:10.465
And were you intimate?

12:10.501 --> 12:12.434
Whoa.

12:12.469 --> 12:14.669
Sheriff...

12:14.705 --> 12:16.438
why are we here?

12:18.408 --> 12:21.276
You're here because you want
to protect your son, Holden.

12:22.446 --> 12:24.546
You told Sheriff Dayton that you suspect

12:24.581 --> 12:27.349
that Pastor Ian, and by
extension, Hollow Sky,

12:27.384 --> 12:29.251
may be interested in your son.
Is that correct?

12:29.286 --> 12:30.685
Yeah, that's correct, but I don't...

12:30.721 --> 12:32.587
Did you ever ask why?

12:32.623 --> 12:34.623
- Holden was in a coma and...
- Yes...

12:34.658 --> 12:36.558
for 12 years.

12:36.593 --> 12:39.494
I have his medical records right here.

12:39.530 --> 12:42.397
It's right... Nope, that's not it.

12:42.466 --> 12:44.299
No, that's not it either.

12:44.334 --> 12:46.368
Okay, well, anyway, I read it,

12:46.403 --> 12:49.538
and it said that your son
woke up after all that time

12:49.573 --> 12:51.339
with no atrophy,

12:51.375 --> 12:52.707
no brain damage,

12:52.743 --> 12:55.544
and neither of you find this strange?

12:55.579 --> 12:57.345
Well, at first...

12:57.381 --> 13:00.248
It's unusual, we'll admit, but...

13:00.284 --> 13:01.683
Holden's not the first miracle.

13:03.554 --> 13:06.288
Actually, he would be,

13:06.323 --> 13:08.657
if miracles did, in fact, happen.

13:08.692 --> 13:11.326
But in my experience,
miracles are stories

13:11.361 --> 13:13.628
used to recruit gullible parties
to a shared belief.

13:13.664 --> 13:15.363
Like a cult.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.366
I kept Holden on life support

13:18.402 --> 13:21.369
because I believe in these stories.

13:21.405 --> 13:22.537
They kept my son alive.

13:22.573 --> 13:25.407
Well, they won't keep him safe.

13:25.442 --> 13:27.676
Not from Hollow Sky.

13:27.711 --> 13:30.478
And not from becoming
Missing Person number 10.

13:30.514 --> 13:33.281
All right, all right, so...

13:33.317 --> 13:34.583
what is it you need from us?

13:34.618 --> 13:36.551
In order to protect your son,

13:36.587 --> 13:38.386
we need to know what Hollow Sky

13:38.422 --> 13:39.654
wants with him.

13:39.690 --> 13:43.391
And we thought that...

13:43.427 --> 13:44.459
Ian,

13:44.494 --> 13:46.628
and your shared history...

13:52.636 --> 13:55.737
You want me to get
back together with Ian?

13:55.772 --> 13:57.539
W-What...

13:57.574 --> 13:58.673
Wait a minute.

13:59.710 --> 14:01.343
Are you out of your mind?

14:01.378 --> 14:04.379
We just need for you to keep the lines
of communication open with him.

14:04.414 --> 14:06.514
And if it comes about naturally,

14:06.550 --> 14:08.283
through a relationship,

14:08.318 --> 14:11.253
then it will be less likely
to arouse suspicion.

14:15.425 --> 14:17.225
We don't expect you to decide tonight.

14:17.261 --> 14:19.327
No! No.

14:20.364 --> 14:21.663
That's my answer.

14:24.668 --> 14:26.668
Come on, let's go.

14:26.703 --> 14:28.603
- Tom?
- No.

14:28.639 --> 14:30.305
I'm so sorry.

15:43.347 --> 15:44.479
Luke?

16:05.235 --> 16:06.468
Luke?

16:47.248 --> 16:49.214
And I walk around to get
a look at his face

16:49.250 --> 16:50.449
and it's not his face, it's...

16:52.219 --> 16:54.353
the thing that disappeared with Frost.

16:57.391 --> 17:00.125
What if, when we destroyed the bridge...

17:00.161 --> 17:02.494
What if we broke something?
What if we made things worse?

17:05.199 --> 17:07.098
It's just a dream.

17:08.368 --> 17:10.202
I have this feeling

17:10.237 --> 17:12.271
we left something unfinished.

17:12.306 --> 17:13.472
We were both there.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.541
We were both on the bridge
when it crumbled.

17:16.577 --> 17:20.112
You prevented those creatures from
crossing over, we both saw it.

17:20.146 --> 17:21.445
How do you explain the dreams?

17:21.482 --> 17:24.249
They're dreams!
They don't mean anything.

17:24.285 --> 17:26.551
You don't really believe that.

17:26.587 --> 17:29.121
I believe we're safe.

17:33.561 --> 17:35.294
Okay...

17:35.329 --> 17:37.162
Well, what about Arthur?

17:37.198 --> 17:38.363
No, he...

17:38.399 --> 17:40.232
He won't be able to help you.

17:42.469 --> 17:44.469
You still haven't told him
about the bridge?

17:44.505 --> 17:46.371
I told him you destroyed it,

17:46.407 --> 17:48.407
and that we succeeded.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.209
But not about Celeste?

17:50.244 --> 17:52.177
And not about your mom?

17:53.547 --> 17:55.214
He's not ready to hear it.

17:58.419 --> 18:00.185
He hasn't...

18:00.221 --> 18:01.486
been himself.

18:04.525 --> 18:06.191
That's my ride.

18:08.362 --> 18:09.494
Okay, well...

18:09.530 --> 18:12.130
dinner tomorrow, remember?

18:12.166 --> 18:14.366
Yeah, you're cooking,
how could I forget.

18:14.401 --> 18:16.301
Do you have any allergies, or...

18:16.337 --> 18:18.237
Uh, just cats.

18:21.208 --> 18:22.374
- Bye.
- Bye.

18:23.577 --> 18:24.543
Bye.

18:24.578 --> 18:27.112
Look at you, you got your
big boy pants on.

18:27.147 --> 18:28.280
Awesome.

18:30.351 --> 18:33.085
Yeah, Holden's favorites
are Yoo-hoo and Hot Pockets.

18:34.221 --> 18:36.088
Just in case you were
wondering what to make.

18:36.123 --> 18:37.256
Okay...

18:37.291 --> 18:39.091
I'll think of something, don't worry.

18:39.126 --> 18:40.125
I'm not worried.

18:41.295 --> 18:42.494
Can you even cook?

18:43.597 --> 18:45.297
How hard can it be?

18:47.301 --> 18:48.467
Yeah, I'm a little worried.

18:49.503 --> 18:52.104
The way I figure it,
if you put in the hours,

18:52.139 --> 18:54.139
I can't see why we can't get you
a position on the floor

18:54.174 --> 18:55.374
alongside AMTs.

18:55.409 --> 18:57.276
I like where I'm at.

18:57.311 --> 19:01.046
But for now, I-I can make my own way.

19:23.504 --> 19:25.103
No, listen,

19:25.139 --> 19:27.272
the only argument worth having

19:27.308 --> 19:29.441
is Jordan versus LeBron and that's it.

19:29.476 --> 19:31.276
I'm just saying, wait a couple seasons,

19:31.312 --> 19:34.212
we'll all be talkin' about
the Baby-Faced Assassin.

19:34.248 --> 19:36.315
- Steph Curry?
- Curry holds five NBA records,

19:36.350 --> 19:38.417
including three-pointers
made in a regular season game

19:38.452 --> 19:40.011
- and don't tell me...
- If I took that many shots,

19:40.011 --> 19:41.637
I'd have the NBA record.

19:44.591 --> 19:47.259
What about you, Matthews?

19:47.294 --> 19:49.428
You've been pretty quiet this week.

19:49.463 --> 19:52.331
You think Curry's got the legs
to dethrone King James?

19:55.369 --> 19:57.336
Um...

19:57.371 --> 20:00.405
Come on, I know you weren't
born yesterday.

20:01.608 --> 20:04.376
Maybe I should run upstairs
and check with your daddy.

20:07.481 --> 20:09.481
I think...

20:09.516 --> 20:11.550
Jordan is the greatest of all time.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.219
Everyone else is just
playing for second.

20:18.225 --> 20:20.192
Oh! You can't argue with that!

20:20.227 --> 20:21.259
Burnski!

20:23.530 --> 20:25.430
I swear I thought I was done

20:25.466 --> 20:28.233
with science projects and book reports.

20:28.268 --> 20:30.602
And then... Bam!
A couple of kids pop out

20:30.637 --> 20:34.473
and you go through the whole
damn thing all over again.

20:34.508 --> 20:38.143
Seems like yesterday we'd all head
down to Wayne's after work,

20:38.178 --> 20:40.412
shoot pool, get hammered.

20:40.447 --> 20:43.582
Pig out on the best burgers
this side of KC.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.584
Not a care in the world.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.419
Piece of advice, Matthews:

20:47.454 --> 20:49.421
Don't grow up too fast.

20:49.456 --> 20:52.357
And don't ever think about having kids.

20:52.393 --> 20:54.326
I'll see you around.

20:54.361 --> 20:55.527
Yeah.

20:57.364 --> 21:01.099
As you inhale,
inhale gently through the nose.

21:02.569 --> 21:05.203
And as you exhale,

21:05.239 --> 21:07.472
exhale through the nose or the mouth.

21:10.244 --> 21:12.277
This helps to center the mind.

21:12.312 --> 21:13.478
Keep going...

21:13.514 --> 21:16.148
I know this is a
beginner's class and all,

21:16.183 --> 21:17.549
but I'd wager most of us
have a handle on

21:17.584 --> 21:20.152
how to get oxygen into our lungs.

21:25.325 --> 21:28.260
And what's next? She teaches us
how to chew our food?

21:28.295 --> 21:29.594
How did you know?

21:29.630 --> 21:31.530
Lucky guess.

21:34.468 --> 21:36.501
This is actually my first class.

21:36.537 --> 21:38.570
No kidding.

21:38.605 --> 21:40.505
I'm Natalie.

21:41.575 --> 21:43.442
- Hi, Natalie, I'm Robin.
- Hi.

21:49.991 --> 21:51.891
- Oh, shampoo.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:51.926 --> 21:53.793
Hang on, not that one.

21:53.828 --> 21:55.962
Grab the other one, the organic.

21:55.997 --> 21:59.098
The tear-free shampoo has numbing
agents that freeze your tear ducts.

21:59.134 --> 22:01.000
How do you know that?

22:01.036 --> 22:03.803
Christine's got every baby
book ever written.

22:03.838 --> 22:06.072
And when you're up with a screaming
infant 23 hours a day...

22:06.107 --> 22:08.741
Well, I'm sure she appreciates the help.

22:08.777 --> 22:10.176
Little guy's my nephew,

22:10.211 --> 22:12.945
and I don't want him growing up
with frozen tear ducts.

22:12.981 --> 22:14.781
Right.

22:14.816 --> 22:16.883
Hey, I was thinking the other day,

22:16.918 --> 22:19.052
all the things that you're able to do,

22:19.087 --> 22:21.754
is all that hereditary?

22:21.790 --> 22:23.923
I mean, if you and Willa had a kid.

22:27.128 --> 22:29.896
You two never talk about that?

22:29.931 --> 22:31.731
Uh,

22:31.766 --> 22:34.000
it's kind of soon, don't you think?

22:34.035 --> 22:35.935
I mean,

22:35.970 --> 22:37.804
you know, we haven't even...

22:40.041 --> 22:42.809
Well, damn, Matthews. What the
hell are you waiting for?

22:42.844 --> 22:44.744
Willa and I, we...

22:44.779 --> 22:46.079
aren't exactly textbook, all right?

22:46.114 --> 22:47.980
We're just...

22:48.016 --> 22:50.817
waiting for the right time.

22:50.852 --> 22:52.885
- The right time?
- Yeah.

22:54.255 --> 22:57.857
This wouldn't have anything
to do with Charlie, would it?

22:59.994 --> 23:01.894
I did you a favor
trying to track her down.

23:01.930 --> 23:03.830
The least you could do is level with me.

23:04.966 --> 23:06.966
I just...

23:07.001 --> 23:08.935
wish I knew she was okay.

23:08.970 --> 23:12.105
She's okay. From what you told me,
she sounds like a survivor.

23:15.743 --> 23:16.976
All right, listen, Matthews,

23:17.011 --> 23:19.812
far be it for me to offer up
any kind of relationship advice,

23:19.848 --> 23:22.181
but you got a good thing
going on with Willa.

23:22.217 --> 23:23.950
She loves you,

23:23.985 --> 23:26.752
and she didn't hightail it and leave
you with a bullet in your shoulder!

23:28.223 --> 23:31.157
So, maybe you should just
drop this whole Charlie thing

23:31.192 --> 23:34.193
and focus on what's
right in front of you.

23:34.229 --> 23:37.029
So, how far along are you?

23:37.065 --> 23:38.898
First trimester,

23:38.933 --> 23:41.033
still keeping it pretty hush-hush.

23:41.069 --> 23:42.768
What about you?

23:42.804 --> 23:45.204
Twenty-two weeks,
just a little over halfway.

23:45.240 --> 23:48.774
So, 22 weeks, that would be, um...

23:48.810 --> 23:50.076
Oh, August 19th.

23:50.111 --> 23:52.745
- A Leo. Ruled by the sun.
- Mm-hmm.

23:52.780 --> 23:54.847
Strong, passionate,

23:54.883 --> 23:56.883
- confident.
- Yeah.

23:56.918 --> 23:58.951
And you are,

23:58.987 --> 24:00.853
don't tell me...

24:00.889 --> 24:02.922
Um...

24:02.957 --> 24:04.690
Sagittarius?

24:04.726 --> 24:06.125
Close! Scorpio.

24:06.161 --> 24:08.161
Get out! Me, too.
When's your birthday?

24:08.196 --> 24:09.896
November 3rd.

24:09.931 --> 24:11.931
I'm the 11th.

24:11.966 --> 24:14.901
You're kidding. That's our anniversary.

24:14.936 --> 24:18.037
My wife and I, we had our first date
on November 11th, 2014.

24:19.941 --> 24:22.041
Wow!

24:22.076 --> 24:24.777
That's... such a coincidence.

24:24.812 --> 24:26.979
- Yeah.
- Huh.

24:28.783 --> 24:30.950
Are you still with your partner?

24:30.985 --> 24:33.052
I-I didn't see a wedding ring,
so I just...

24:33.087 --> 24:35.888
I just assumed. I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have.

24:38.860 --> 24:41.060
No, it's... it's totally fine.

24:41.095 --> 24:42.895
Um...

24:44.866 --> 24:46.799
We're not... We're not.

24:46.834 --> 24:47.900
It was...

24:47.936 --> 24:49.902
It was just a...

24:49.938 --> 24:51.204
one-time thing,

24:51.239 --> 24:54.740
drunken night in a motel room.

24:54.776 --> 24:58.211
But it was a night I'll remember
for the rest of my life.

25:02.083 --> 25:04.951
Uh, but as for the father,

25:04.986 --> 25:06.986
he's in the rear-view.

25:07.021 --> 25:08.988
Trust me, it's better that way.

25:09.023 --> 25:10.823
Mm.

25:20.835 --> 25:22.101
Is it good?

25:22.136 --> 25:24.170
It's not too spicy, right?

25:25.873 --> 25:28.074
Spicy? No, it's uh...

25:28.109 --> 25:29.976
it's really good.

25:32.847 --> 25:34.914
I didn't have any crushed black pepper,

25:34.949 --> 25:36.849
so I just replaced it with red.

25:40.054 --> 25:42.755
And doubled everything,
seeing how there's two of us.

25:45.226 --> 25:47.860
No, it all came out, um...

25:47.895 --> 25:49.795
Everything's...

25:49.831 --> 25:51.097
It's really good.

25:56.771 --> 25:59.138
Do you feel like some music?
Something romantic, maybe?

26:01.009 --> 26:02.775
I'll see what I can find.

26:02.810 --> 26:03.909
Okay.

26:20.995 --> 26:23.896
- Is it loud enough?
- It's perfect.

26:32.807 --> 26:33.939
Mm.

26:35.743 --> 26:37.843
So...

26:37.879 --> 26:39.912
work is good?

26:39.947 --> 26:42.748
Yeah. Yeah, work is, um,

26:42.784 --> 26:43.983
it's good.

26:44.018 --> 26:45.985
It takes some adjusting,
but, you know...

26:47.955 --> 26:49.722
Uh, there's this, um,

26:49.757 --> 26:51.891
this guy in the warehouse
with me, Lenny.

26:51.926 --> 26:54.060
He's... entertaining.

26:54.095 --> 26:56.762
Uh, he was arguing the other day

26:56.798 --> 26:58.731
about how many rings Steph Curry has.

26:58.766 --> 27:01.667
- Rings?
- Championship rings, yeah.

27:01.703 --> 27:02.802
So, he thinks this guy Steph...

27:02.837 --> 27:04.937
Steph's a guy?

27:06.040 --> 27:07.707
Well, he's a...

27:07.742 --> 27:09.775
he's a basketball player.

27:09.811 --> 27:11.010
Oh.

27:13.981 --> 27:16.716
Anyway, he said something
about having the NBA record.

27:16.751 --> 27:19.051
It, uh, it really wasn't that funny.

27:21.823 --> 27:23.723
I'm sure it was.

27:45.046 --> 27:47.847
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, no...

27:47.882 --> 27:51.784
Okay, we can't eat this.
What do you want to do?

27:51.819 --> 27:55.020
Lenny told me about
this one spot, uh, Wayne's?

27:55.056 --> 27:56.155
Mm.

27:56.190 --> 27:59.125
Best burger this side of KC.

28:10.037 --> 28:13.105
"Best burgers this side of KC."

28:13.141 --> 28:15.808
Maybe you have to be drunk.

28:50.080 --> 28:53.781
Twenty-two weeks,
just a little over halfway.

28:53.817 --> 28:55.983
Twenty-two weeks, that would be...

28:56.019 --> 28:57.919
Oh, August 19th.

28:57.954 --> 28:59.754
A Leo...

29:04.861 --> 29:06.794
Door was unlocked.

29:07.964 --> 29:09.797
Yeah...

29:11.101 --> 29:13.167
I've been meaning to get that fixed.

29:13.203 --> 29:15.837
You know, you can't
be too careful these days,

29:15.872 --> 29:17.772
what with all the creepy middle-aged men

29:17.807 --> 29:20.141
trolling around prenatal
yoga parking lots.

29:20.176 --> 29:22.110
I mean, really. Are you trying

29:22.145 --> 29:24.145
to end up on a pervert watch-list?

29:26.216 --> 29:29.016
Where are we with your friend?

29:29.052 --> 29:30.952
Where we are...

29:30.987 --> 29:33.988
is exactly where we need to be.

29:34.023 --> 29:35.990
Do not rush me.

29:36.025 --> 29:38.860
Oh, I'm not gonna rush you.

29:38.895 --> 29:40.728
Ramon, on the other hand,

29:40.764 --> 29:43.030
has a very short attention span.

29:43.066 --> 29:45.199
He's like a 5-year-old.

29:45.235 --> 29:48.136
At the moment, he's keeping
a very close eye on Anabelle

29:48.171 --> 29:50.171
and...

29:50.206 --> 29:53.007
I hate to see him get fidgety.

29:53.042 --> 29:55.143
You know Ramon when he gets fidgety.

29:55.178 --> 29:57.078
People disappear.

29:58.148 --> 30:00.815
But by all means, take your time.

30:05.121 --> 30:07.088
I'll get you what you want.

30:07.123 --> 30:09.824
Well, it's not just about what I want.

30:09.859 --> 30:12.026
We made a deal. Quid pro quo.

30:12.061 --> 30:15.096
Anabelle wasn't part of the deal.

30:15.131 --> 30:17.198
Well, she is now.

30:22.272 --> 30:24.972
Hey, real quick.

30:25.008 --> 30:27.875
Um, was Freddie Mercury upset

30:27.911 --> 30:30.111
when he realized his jacket was missing?

30:33.249 --> 30:35.149
Ticktock.

30:47.297 --> 30:50.097
Ooh! Oh!

30:50.166 --> 30:52.967
Close! It was close.

30:53.002 --> 30:55.236
- It was close.
- I might be winning now.

30:55.271 --> 30:57.271
- Oh, and I'm still...
- You're not gonna win!

30:57.307 --> 30:59.874
I'm winning. Okay...

30:59.909 --> 31:01.976
Here we go. This is the one.

31:02.011 --> 31:04.045
- Uh-huh.
- I can feel it.

31:04.080 --> 31:05.813
Okay.

31:05.849 --> 31:08.049
Ooh!

31:08.084 --> 31:09.951
Did I make it? Did it go in?

31:09.986 --> 31:11.953
You didn't get it.

31:13.089 --> 31:15.122
But, you know, you tried.

31:15.158 --> 31:16.791
Thank you.

31:17.961 --> 31:19.927
I think...

31:19.963 --> 31:21.863
what you meant to do...

31:23.833 --> 31:25.867
was this.

31:30.907 --> 31:32.206
Damn.

31:32.242 --> 31:34.242
My bad.

31:34.277 --> 31:36.844
Looked like it was going in, too.

31:39.282 --> 31:41.949
You gonna introduce me?

31:41.985 --> 31:43.150
Uh...

31:45.889 --> 31:47.788
Willa, this is Stevie.

31:47.824 --> 31:50.258
Uh, Steven. From work.

31:50.293 --> 31:52.860
We're in the middle of a game.

31:54.030 --> 31:56.097
Holden and I,

31:56.132 --> 31:58.933
we don't just know each other from work.

31:58.968 --> 32:01.202
We went to school together.

32:01.237 --> 32:03.771
K through 7?

32:05.241 --> 32:07.141
You don't remember?

32:08.778 --> 32:11.779
He doesn't remember.

32:12.949 --> 32:16.083
This guy was an Einstein
when it came to math,

32:16.119 --> 32:18.085
science, you name it.

32:18.121 --> 32:19.787
No one, I mean,

32:19.822 --> 32:22.056
no one better to copy off of.

32:22.091 --> 32:24.125
Okay, well, good seeing you, Steven.

32:29.032 --> 32:31.098
It makes me wonder

32:31.134 --> 32:34.101
why a guy like you,

32:34.137 --> 32:35.836
Holden Matthews,

32:35.872 --> 32:37.772
local celebrity,

32:37.807 --> 32:40.174
would be working in the warehouse.

32:42.879 --> 32:45.846
Maybe so Daddy can
bump you up the ladder.

32:48.184 --> 32:51.886
Make you Project Manager, and nobody
bats an eye. Is that it?

32:54.123 --> 32:57.224
You think you get to wake up
after 12 years

32:57.260 --> 32:59.794
and just skip to the front of the line?

33:01.164 --> 33:03.731
Who's gonna stand in your way?
You're the boss's kid.

33:03.766 --> 33:06.000
We're really just trying
to play some pool,

33:06.035 --> 33:08.736
and mind our own business.

33:08.771 --> 33:11.772
Look, we can talk about this tomorrow.

33:11.808 --> 33:13.174
Sound good?

33:16.846 --> 33:18.879
Nah.

33:20.984 --> 33:23.884
I think I want to play some pool too.

33:26.155 --> 33:27.221
Then play us.

33:29.125 --> 33:30.825
Play us for the table.

33:31.928 --> 33:33.194
Unless you think you'll lose

33:33.262 --> 33:35.062
to Einstein and his girlfriend.

33:45.008 --> 33:46.907
Rack 'em up, buttercup.

34:43.933 --> 34:46.766
Oh!

34:47.837 --> 34:49.203
Tough break, princess.

34:57.213 --> 34:59.146
- Yes!
- Yes!

34:59.182 --> 35:01.882
- Whoo-hoo!
- No, no, no, no!

35:01.918 --> 35:05.052
That ball... that ball was stopped!

35:05.088 --> 35:07.788
- Tough break, princess.
- No.

35:07.824 --> 35:10.175
I saw it. That ball stopped cold.

35:10.960 --> 35:12.827
You did something!

35:12.862 --> 35:14.795
You bumped the table. You did
something, I don't know what,

35:14.831 --> 35:16.163
but that ball was stopped.

35:16.199 --> 35:18.766
I think you lost, Stevie.

35:18.801 --> 35:20.000
See you tomorrow.

35:21.838 --> 35:23.804
Cheating son-of-a-bitch.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.206
What did you do?

35:28.144 --> 35:30.211
Hey! Hey!

35:41.858 --> 35:43.224
What did you do, pretty boy?

36:12.855 --> 36:15.022
Oh!

36:28.905 --> 36:30.871
Sorry for the mess.

36:45.711 --> 36:47.085
Well...

36:47.085 --> 36:48.952
I think the bleeding stopped.

36:48.987 --> 36:50.954
Let me see.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.733
Hmm.

37:03.769 --> 37:05.101
I think you're right.

37:05.137 --> 37:08.104
You enjoyed it, didn't you?

37:09.908 --> 37:12.909
Putting Stevie and those
other guys in their place?

37:14.046 --> 37:15.745
It made you happy.

37:16.982 --> 37:18.782
It kind of felt good.

37:19.818 --> 37:21.952
The adrenaline, it felt...

37:21.987 --> 37:23.920
powerful.

37:25.123 --> 37:27.791
You should have let me handle it.

37:28.961 --> 37:30.126
Why?

37:32.965 --> 37:35.165
You did the right thing.

37:35.200 --> 37:36.867
You showed restraint.

37:38.904 --> 37:40.804
Look, maybe...

37:40.839 --> 37:43.874
we can't be like those normal
couples you see...

37:43.909 --> 37:45.775
in restaurants,

37:45.811 --> 37:47.777
and walking down the street
holding hands.

37:47.813 --> 37:49.779
But...

37:49.815 --> 37:52.015
I think we can come close.

37:52.050 --> 37:54.851
Close enough for our own
version of normal.

38:03.762 --> 38:05.962
Wanna come in?

38:05.998 --> 38:08.064
Um...

38:08.100 --> 38:10.800
What about your parents?

38:13.038 --> 38:16.072
Another time, I promise. It's just...

38:16.108 --> 38:19.943
I should go home and check on Arthur.

38:21.179 --> 38:22.979
You should rest that lip.

38:23.015 --> 38:24.748
All right.

38:34.226 --> 38:36.059
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

40:00.245 --> 40:02.746
You're getting good at these.

40:05.817 --> 40:08.118
Maybe one of these days you could
draw me. What do you say?

40:08.153 --> 40:09.853
One of those silly pictures

40:09.888 --> 40:12.155
with the big heads and the tiny bodies.

40:16.028 --> 40:18.128
Don't feel like talking, huh?

40:18.163 --> 40:19.996
I'll be back in an hour for your tray.

40:20.032 --> 40:21.931
I wanna see that plate empty, mister.

40:24.036 --> 40:26.970
Holden Matthews.

40:27.005 --> 40:29.105
I need to find Holden Matthews.

40:31.209 --> 40:33.043
He a friend of yours?

40:36.148 --> 40:37.947
We'll have to check with your doctor,

40:37.983 --> 40:39.849
see if you're ready for visitors.

40:41.019 --> 40:44.220
I need to find Holden Matthews.

40:47.192 --> 40:49.793
What the hell?

41:06.778 --> 41:08.144
No!

41:12.117 --> 41:14.017
Are you okay? Are you burned?

41:14.052 --> 41:16.219
- No, I don't think so.
- What happened?

41:18.090 --> 41:20.090
I was just about to leave and he
starting asking for someone.

41:20.125 --> 41:21.991
A name, he just kept repeating a name...

41:22.027 --> 41:23.126
What name?

41:23.161 --> 41:26.162
Who was he asking for?

41:28.880 --> 41:34.356
