00:06.141 --> 00:07.558
Erlich!
Seeing you Thursday, right?

00:07.558 --> 00:08.307
Jian Yang's pitch?

00:08.641 --> 00:10.141
Yes, we can't wait to pitch you
the idea

00:10.141 --> 00:11.850
that is gonna be pitched to you.

00:11.850 --> 00:12.558
Great, I'll see you then.

00:13.599 --> 00:14.766
You have no idea what it is,
do you?

00:14.766 --> 00:15.808
Not a fucking clue.

00:16.933 --> 00:18.307
I'm taking Piper Chat,

00:18.307 --> 00:20.683
all your users will be converted
to Hooli Chat users.

00:20.683 --> 00:22.182
You have five seconds to decide.

00:22.850 --> 00:23.766
-Five...
-Okay.

00:24.474 --> 00:25.891
I don't know
if this will be relevant,

00:25.891 --> 00:27.975
but he did say the word,
"oculus," a whole bunch.

00:28.182 --> 00:29.266
-Oculus?
-Mm-hm.

00:29.516 --> 00:31.850
Jian? I'm very excited
for your VR play.

00:31.850 --> 00:32.683
Who's doing VR?

00:32.933 --> 00:34.349
This has to do with the Oculus,
right?

00:34.683 --> 00:36.307
-Octopus.
-Octopus?

00:36.599 --> 00:37.766
-It's a water animal.
-I--

00:38.016 --> 00:40.558
I-- I know what an octopus is.

00:40.558 --> 00:42.141
Gavin, I need to talk to you

00:42.141 --> 00:43.850
about this Piper Chat
acquisition.

00:43.850 --> 00:47.808
Now, Carl, you said the new
sign-in page made you nervous...

00:56.850 --> 00:59.057
Are these
my favorite nail beds
I've ever seen?

00:59.057 --> 01:00.766
No, but they're fine.

01:00.766 --> 01:04.558
Okay. You know,
I-- I wasn't actually
gonna come here.

01:04.558 --> 01:06.891
But then, I thought,
"You know what? I could--
I could use a walk."

01:06.891 --> 01:08.891
And, um, well,
I've just been working on

01:08.891 --> 01:10.724
this peer-to-peer
Internet thing,

01:10.724 --> 01:13.433
and well, I--
I think better
when I walk.

01:13.433 --> 01:15.474
Mm-hmm.
If I'm gonna be
thinking and walking,

01:15.474 --> 01:16.850
I might as well walk
somewhere specific.

01:16.850 --> 01:18.891
Hey, when was
the last time you slept?

01:18.891 --> 01:21.349
Um... I don't know.

01:21.349 --> 01:23.558
Well, I know I--
I was gonna sleep
last night,

01:23.558 --> 01:26.433
but, uh... I thought
I had this solve

01:26.433 --> 01:28.558
for this
computational trust issue
I've been working on,

01:28.558 --> 01:30.433
but it turns out,
I didn't have a solve.

01:30.433 --> 01:33.099
But it was too late.
I had already drank
the whole pot of coffee.

01:33.099 --> 01:35.057
Okay. Well, I'm busy.
I've got to see patients
all the time.

01:35.057 --> 01:37.016
What are you doing?
Sorry. I don't want
to interrupt you.

01:37.016 --> 01:39.933
Sorry, just-- just one second.
I just had a quick thought.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.433
Why are
you writing it
on there?

01:41.433 --> 01:43.599
Well, I mean, you change these
between every patient, right?

01:43.599 --> 01:45.433
I guess I'm going
to have to now.

01:45.433 --> 01:49.266
You know, all the guys
at the house, they think
I'm nuts, but I'm not nuts.

01:49.266 --> 01:52.307
Hey, you know,
they say that after Alan Turing
was chemically castrated,

01:52.307 --> 01:53.808
he got a lot less annoying.

01:53.808 --> 01:56.599
What was that?
Hmm?

01:56.599 --> 01:58.724
Nothing. Just-- that's just
something to think about.

01:58.724 --> 02:00.683
Okay. Sure, yeah.

02:00.683 --> 02:01.850
Pen, please.

02:01.850 --> 02:03.266
Right, yeah.

02:03.266 --> 02:05.182
Go ahead and pay
the lady out front.

02:05.182 --> 02:06.933
Cash is
always appreciated.

02:06.933 --> 02:09.598
Hmm. How the hell
does this thing work?

02:20.558 --> 02:22.349
Question for you.

02:22.349 --> 02:25.516
What's better
than octopus recipe?

02:25.516 --> 02:27.141
Answer for you.

02:27.141 --> 02:29.766
Eight recipes
for octopus.

02:29.766 --> 02:33.182
My grandmother gave me
a family recipe

02:33.182 --> 02:36.099
before she died
in a horrible way.

02:36.099 --> 02:37.599
Wait. What?

02:37.599 --> 02:41.850
Sorry. We knew
Jian-Yang's app was
in the food space,

02:41.850 --> 02:44.349
but we assumed
that it was camera-based.

02:44.349 --> 02:45.891
Like, you take
a photo of food,

02:45.891 --> 02:50.141
the app returns nutritional
information, or recipes,

02:50.141 --> 02:51.975
or how it was sourced.

02:51.975 --> 02:53.474
Yeah, like Shazam
for food.

02:53.474 --> 02:56.057
Exactly. But this,
I mean, this is--

02:56.057 --> 02:59.724
Shazam... for food.

02:59.724 --> 03:01.516
No, Shazam's not my vision.

03:01.516 --> 03:04.891
Of course they know that
you're not pitching Shazam.
That already exists.

03:04.891 --> 03:08.891
This would be
a Shazam... for food.

03:08.891 --> 03:11.307
No.
Sorry. Language barrier.

03:11.307 --> 03:14.307
Do you speak Mandarin?
Anybody? No?

03:20.349 --> 03:22.975
That's not Mandarin.
He's a stickler
for the accent.

03:22.975 --> 03:26.433
No, my app is seafood,
like food...

03:26.433 --> 03:28.266
in the sea.
That you can see.

03:28.266 --> 03:32.349
Oh, "see food."
S-E-E food.
Oh.

03:32.349 --> 03:35.016
SeeFood.
Now, that we like.

03:35.016 --> 03:38.224
Seafood. It's like
food in the sea.

03:47.307 --> 03:48.391
Fuck.

03:51.391 --> 03:53.057
Oh, Gavin. Gavin.

03:53.057 --> 03:55.433
I head about
your PiperChat issue.

03:55.433 --> 03:58.516
Those COPPA fines are no joke,
could be billions.

03:58.516 --> 04:00.599
I'm acutely aware, Jack.

04:00.599 --> 04:03.474
Listen, after all
you've done for me--

04:03.474 --> 04:07.516
bringing me
into the Hooli sandbox,
letting me play here--

04:07.516 --> 04:09.558
what if,
hypothetically,

04:09.558 --> 04:12.224
I had a way to delete
the underage accounts

04:12.224 --> 04:14.224
and the chat data
in question?

04:14.224 --> 04:17.766
Hypothetically,
I could blame it
on a malfunction

04:17.766 --> 04:20.266
of my Endframe/Box servers.

04:20.266 --> 04:24.057
The board would have
nothing to blame you for.

04:24.057 --> 04:27.099
Jack, I'm speechless.
I'm embarrassed to say it,

04:27.099 --> 04:29.933
- but I was beginning to question your loyalty.
-   Yeah.

04:37.266 --> 04:40.641
Well, you should've.
I said it was hypothetical.

04:40.641 --> 04:42.349
Didn't say I'd do it.

04:51.474 --> 04:54.182
Why don't you go ahead
and take a seat, Gavin?

04:57.766 --> 05:01.766
Uh, you guys?
Gavin Belson just got fired!

05:01.766 --> 05:03.599
- Richard.
- Wait. What?

05:03.599 --> 05:05.224
Shit, that's huge.

05:05.224 --> 05:08.891
"There are unconfirmed reports
that Belson violated
Hooli protocol

05:08.891 --> 05:12.933
in the acquisition of a company
that contained toxic assets."

05:12.933 --> 05:16.599
Oh, that's us!
Oh, my God.
Gavin's been fired?

05:16.599 --> 05:18.266
Did you fall
in the pool?

05:18.266 --> 05:21.224
Oh, no. No, I didn't.

05:21.224 --> 05:23.349
I was, um...
I was dangling
my feet in,

05:23.349 --> 05:26.016
'cause it was cool
and refreshing and just
helping me think,

05:26.016 --> 05:27.808
and then,
since I was wet anyway,

05:27.808 --> 05:29.641
I purposefully started
to wade around in the pool.

05:29.641 --> 05:32.474
Uh... But don't worry.
No, I didn't fall in.

05:32.474 --> 05:34.975
I, uh...
I am not a spaz.

05:34.975 --> 05:39.391
"Belson will be succeeded
by 'Action' Jack Barker.

05:39.391 --> 05:41.683
"A veteran tech CEO,
Barker commented,

05:41.683 --> 05:42.933
"'We at Hooli
pledge to work

05:42.933 --> 05:44.808
"with the Federal Trade
Commission

05:44.808 --> 05:46.808
"to resolve this matter
and commit ourselves

05:46.808 --> 05:48.558
to earning back
the public trust.'"

05:48.558 --> 05:50.474
Wow, Dinesh,
you really stuck it to him.

05:50.474 --> 05:52.182
Now they're pinning it
all on Gavin.

05:52.182 --> 05:54.683
Holy shit.
Dude, you're moist.

05:54.683 --> 05:56.808
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, I'll go
and get a towel.

05:58.057 --> 06:00.933
I mean, Dinesh,
you're a... a giant slayer.

06:00.933 --> 06:05.307
As long as he's
the one taking the fall
for these underage users.

06:05.307 --> 06:08.558
I thought I'd have to, like,
answer to Congress or something.

06:08.558 --> 06:11.683
Yeah, that makes sense.
You were worried sick
about the wrath

06:11.683 --> 06:14.141
of a bloated
and inept bureaucracy,

06:14.141 --> 06:16.349
but feel
totally comfortable
having crossed

06:16.349 --> 06:21.057
a spiteful
and vindictive megalomaniac
with unlimited funds.

06:21.057 --> 06:24.224
Shut up.
Gavin wouldn't come
after me personally.

06:24.224 --> 06:26.307
I think you might be
the first Pakistani man

06:26.307 --> 06:29.016
to be killed by a drone
inside the United States.

06:29.016 --> 06:32.266
People don't
have people killed
in the Valley.

06:32.266 --> 06:34.766
Not even Gavin Belson. Okay?

06:37.391 --> 06:38.307
Right, Jared?

06:38.307 --> 06:40.433
I-- I once saw him
throw a sloth

06:40.433 --> 06:42.683
down a flight of stairs
after a presentation,

06:42.683 --> 06:47.057
and he said it was
an accident, but he had
this look in his eyes.

06:47.057 --> 06:48.724
I-- I can't rule it out.

06:48.724 --> 06:55.057
"A legacy lost.
CEO and chief innovator
Gavin Belson exits Hooli."

06:55.057 --> 06:57.182
The end
of the Gavin Belson era.

06:57.182 --> 07:00.391
And if all goes well,
it is the beginning
of the era

07:00.391 --> 07:05.891
of Erlich Bachman
and his funky Asian
dude friend Jian...

07:07.016 --> 07:09.391
Jian? Jian-Yang!

07:10.891 --> 07:13.182
Coleman Blair and Associates
just offered us

07:13.182 --> 07:15.933
a seed investment
of $200,000

07:15.933 --> 07:17.766
for the Shazam of food.

07:17.766 --> 07:20.641
All we have
to do is dazzle them
with a demo on Monday,

07:20.641 --> 07:23.266
and, uh,
the check will--

07:23.266 --> 07:24.891
What the fuck?
Huh?

07:24.891 --> 07:28.182
Is that my vintage
Corona Club beach towel?

07:28.182 --> 07:31.016
Yes. I was in the pool,
but I got out.

07:31.016 --> 07:33.016
That's a beach towel,
not a pool--

07:33.016 --> 07:36.391
Where were you?
I was referring to you
as my funky Asian friend.

07:36.391 --> 07:38.224
The passenger door's
all fucked up!

07:38.224 --> 07:40.683
I told you,
there's no demo.

07:40.683 --> 07:42.516
I'm making
my recipe app.

07:42.516 --> 07:46.599
You're gonna walk away
from $200,000?

07:46.599 --> 07:49.266
You know who
walks away from that kind
of money, Jian-Yang?

07:49.266 --> 07:50.850
Richard, a crazy person.

07:50.850 --> 07:52.599
Crazy? No. Opposite.

07:52.599 --> 07:55.099
He walked away
from $10 million.
Now look at him--

07:55.099 --> 07:57.850
wet pants,
stealing towels,

07:57.850 --> 08:01.141
babbling about technical issues
that he can't solve.

08:01.141 --> 08:04.516
I am one
computational trust issue away
from solving this thing.

08:04.516 --> 08:06.558
Is this how
you wanna end up?

08:09.558 --> 08:12.224
No. He's a cautionary tale.

08:12.224 --> 08:14.724
- Nope, not true.
- Not a cautionary tale.

08:14.724 --> 08:17.808
Got a lot of work to do.
I'll be in the pool. Not crazy.

08:17.808 --> 08:20.724
I mean, it's like,
wow.
Richard...

08:20.724 --> 08:23.850
- Hey, Erlich.
- Just FYI.

08:23.850 --> 08:28.474
I actually did
some image recognition
stuff on Nip Alert,

08:28.474 --> 08:31.641
so maybe you could hire me
to help on the demo,

08:31.641 --> 08:34.140
'cause my dad's been,
like, kinda on me lately

08:34.140 --> 08:37.057
to, like, get a job
or go to school 'cause...

08:37.057 --> 08:40.349
'cause he's upset that
I lost all that money on--
on PiperChat.

08:40.349 --> 08:44.516
And then also,
you helped me lose
that 20 million on Bachmanity.

08:44.516 --> 08:45.891
Big Head, um...

08:46.850 --> 08:48.724
Jian-Yang's culture--

08:48.724 --> 08:51.641
he's...
Chinese--

08:51.641 --> 08:54.933
won't allow him
to accept outside help.

08:54.933 --> 08:57.641
Oh, right,
'cause of Chinese.

08:58.516 --> 09:00.307
Okay, well,
that makes sense.

09:03.266 --> 09:05.057
If either of you
could aid

09:05.057 --> 09:08.391
in the construction of this
image recognition software,

09:08.391 --> 09:10.016
I can pay you handsomely.

09:14.224 --> 09:18.349
Huh. Five years at ASU,
then you dropped out?
No degree?

09:18.349 --> 09:22.182
Mm-hmm.
Pretty solid "C's" in all
of your CS classes.

09:22.182 --> 09:23.224
Right.

09:23.224 --> 09:25.724
But really more incompletes
than anything.

09:25.724 --> 09:28.433
Yeah, a lot of those classes
were at 11:00 a.m., so...

09:29.307 --> 09:31.850
I'm sorry, but I--
I don't think

09:31.850 --> 09:34.599
you're Stanford CS material,
Mr. Bighetti.

09:34.599 --> 09:36.975
Yeah, that's totally fair.
Thanks so much.

09:38.099 --> 09:39.433
Have a nice day.

09:43.182 --> 09:46.891
Oh, hey, did you get this
at a party on Alcatraz?

09:46.891 --> 09:49.891
Yes.
Oh, cool.
I got one there, too.

09:49.891 --> 09:52.808
Or, I mean,
I guess, technically,
I bought one there.

09:52.808 --> 09:55.433
I bought everything there.

09:55.433 --> 09:56.724
Excuse me?

09:56.724 --> 09:59.349
Oh, Bachmanity was
my VC fund.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.099
What?

10:01.099 --> 10:04.266
It stands
for Venture Capital.
I know. Umm...

10:04.266 --> 10:06.016
Wh--

10:06.016 --> 10:07.641
Wait. Nelson Bighetti.

10:07.641 --> 10:09.766
Were you on the cover
of WIRED  magazine?

10:09.766 --> 10:12.349
Yeah, and actually
inside, too.

10:13.391 --> 10:14.724
Can I get you
some coffee?

10:15.891 --> 10:19.182
The last 24 hours
have been very painful.

10:19.182 --> 10:23.016
But in the days to come,
what I will be thinking
of most is all of you,

10:23.016 --> 10:26.766
the good people of Hooli,
and what we've built together.

10:26.766 --> 10:31.641
And, yes, we built
great products here.
Great products.

10:31.641 --> 10:36.433
But I like to think we built
an even greater connection.

10:36.433 --> 10:38.724
So, in the spirit
of that connection,

10:38.724 --> 10:41.307
if any of you would like
to say something to me--

10:41.307 --> 10:44.516
positive or negative--
this is the time.

10:44.516 --> 10:47.224
I encourage you to be
completely honest.

10:50.808 --> 10:52.433
Don't be shy.

10:52.433 --> 10:56.099
This is most likely
the last chance
we have to talk.

10:57.141 --> 10:58.141
Anything at all.

11:04.850 --> 11:06.266
Ah. Here we go.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.224
Todd, our senior
systems engineer.

11:17.808 --> 11:19.766
I'm sorry,
but it's my official duty

11:19.766 --> 11:22.182
to... escort you
off the property...

11:22.182 --> 11:23.724
I understand.

11:23.724 --> 11:26.599
Thank you for your dedication--
...and relieve you
of your badge.

11:29.182 --> 11:30.182
Yes.

11:31.599 --> 11:33.016
I guess this is it then.

11:34.182 --> 11:35.224
Goodbye, Hoover.

11:37.808 --> 11:39.516
Your parking hang tag.

11:55.391 --> 11:58.141
I mean,
do you think I'm crazy
for chasing this thing?

11:58.141 --> 12:01.016
Don't ask me. I'm hardly
in a position to judge.

12:01.016 --> 12:04.975
I mean, you do realize
I'm literally the only person
in this entire grocery store

12:04.975 --> 12:07.724
who's actually
buying stuff for myself.

12:07.724 --> 12:10.099
I don't know.
Maybe these people
are right.

12:10.099 --> 12:12.516
Maybe I just drop
this one, move on,

12:12.516 --> 12:15.057
and become
some pathetic fucking
TaskRabbit, you know?

12:15.057 --> 12:17.599
Hey, I have
a family, asshole.

12:17.599 --> 12:20.683
Oh. Sorry. Not you,
the other ones.

12:20.683 --> 12:23.391
Look, if you
can't crack this idea,
there's no shame.

12:23.391 --> 12:25.975
I mean, a lot
of really smart people
have gotten stuck on it.

12:25.975 --> 12:27.891
Please. Like who?

12:27.891 --> 12:29.057
Peter Gregory for one.

12:30.433 --> 12:32.724
Peter was thinking about
a fully decentralized Internet?

12:32.724 --> 12:34.224
Why wouldn't you
mention this to me?

12:34.224 --> 12:36.099
Well, because he walked away
from it,

12:36.099 --> 12:39.016
and you seemed
so excited about it,
I thought you had a new angle.

12:39.016 --> 12:40.683
I didn't want
to discourage you.

12:40.683 --> 12:43.850
Oh, what, 'cause I'm
some delicate little flower?
I couldn't handle it?

12:45.182 --> 12:47.891
The thing is,
Peter tended
to cling to things,

12:47.891 --> 12:51.099
and he gave up on this.
I mean, he must've had
a reason.

12:52.724 --> 12:55.558
Wait. Peter was
a compulsive note-taker. Right?

12:55.558 --> 12:58.933
What about his journals?
I mean, do you guys
still have them?

12:58.933 --> 13:01.641
Richard, I am on thin ice
as it is at Raviga.

13:01.641 --> 13:05.099
No. Monica,
listen to me, okay?
I haven't slept in days.

13:05.099 --> 13:07.182
I'm walking into pools
fully clothed.

13:07.182 --> 13:10.057
This is all
I think about.
Please.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.933
Fine, but just
this once.

13:12.933 --> 13:15.433
Yes. Thank you.

13:15.433 --> 13:17.349
Fuck. It's Erlich. He--
What?

13:17.349 --> 13:19.266
He wants me to help
spin up this demo

13:19.266 --> 13:21.391
for Jian-Yang's bullshit
Shazam-for-food app.

13:21.391 --> 13:23.850
Wait, the thing
that Coleman Blair
just bought? That was them?

13:23.850 --> 13:25.433
Yeah, but they
haven't bought it yet.

13:25.433 --> 13:27.474
I mean, they sign
the deal on Monday,

13:27.474 --> 13:29.433
but it's all contingent
on a working demo,

13:29.433 --> 13:31.891
which they do not
and will not have.

13:31.891 --> 13:33.224
Interesting.

13:33.224 --> 13:35.016
You're doing great work
by the way.

13:35.016 --> 13:37.558
Fuck you.
Definitely.
Thank you.

13:40.474 --> 13:42.349
I'll have those forms
to you by 11.

13:43.850 --> 13:49.307
Yeah, so it's called SeeFood,
but it's S-E-E Food, get it?

13:49.307 --> 13:51.474
Yes, Erlich Bachman
showed me a demo,

13:51.474 --> 13:53.808
and this thing
is incredible.

13:53.808 --> 13:58.141
Yeah, and Coleman Blair
is gonna get the whole deal
for only 200K.

13:58.141 --> 14:01.558
But here's the thing,
they don't close until Monday.

14:01.558 --> 14:04.141
I mean, if I had Laurie's ear,
I would tell her

14:04.141 --> 14:06.307
that we should pay them today
and close the deal,

14:06.307 --> 14:09.141
and Bachman would
jump on it in a second.

14:10.808 --> 14:14.016
Go choke on that, broham.

14:17.182 --> 14:18.266
Very funny.

14:19.516 --> 14:20.474
What's funny?

14:20.474 --> 14:22.433
This message.
"Hey, I'm a big fan

14:22.433 --> 14:23.683
"of what you did
to Gavin Belson.

14:23.683 --> 14:25.391
"I've seen your photo
and think you're cute.

14:25.391 --> 14:27.099
Would love to meet up. Mia."

14:27.099 --> 14:29.349
Fuck you.
I didn't send that.

14:29.349 --> 14:32.016
Oh, you didn't?
My hand to Satan.

14:32.016 --> 14:34.516
But before you go ahead
and get a little brown boner
in your pants,

14:34.516 --> 14:36.224
you might wanna consider
that it's not a woman.

14:36.224 --> 14:39.266
I bet you're being catfished
by Gavin himself.

14:39.266 --> 14:40.975
Oh, fuck.

14:42.808 --> 14:45.016
But...
But what?

14:45.016 --> 14:47.558
On the off chance that this
is an actual real woman,

14:47.558 --> 14:50.349
getting murdered seems
like an acceptable risk.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.224
Oh, hey.
Hey.

14:53.224 --> 14:55.558
Let me ask you something.
Do you think wearing

14:55.558 --> 14:57.391
the name of the college
you're going to to class

14:57.391 --> 14:59.474
is like the same thing
as wearing the name
of the band

14:59.474 --> 15:01.349
you're going to
to a concert?

15:01.349 --> 15:03.891
What?
Did you get
into Stanford?

15:03.891 --> 15:06.975
Yeah, and this is
totally going to get
my dad off my back,

15:06.975 --> 15:09.099
and they said
they liked my story,

15:09.099 --> 15:11.891
so I'm gonna take
a CS class there.

15:11.891 --> 15:15.057
And they're so nice.
I was asking if it was
gonna be pass/fail,

15:15.057 --> 15:16.683
and they were like,
"It's up to you."

15:16.683 --> 15:18.766
And then I said,
"Is there gonna be homework?"

15:18.766 --> 15:21.349
And they were like,
"Only if you want it."

15:21.349 --> 15:24.724
And so then, I guess
I have to decide
if I want it,

15:24.724 --> 15:28.641
which kinda
already feels like homework,
but do you think I...

15:32.057 --> 15:34.433
Holy shit.

15:34.433 --> 15:38.057
It's like we just walked right
into Peter Gregory's brain.

15:38.057 --> 15:42.099
Actually, I think Peter's brain
is in a cryo-locker
in Menlo Park.

15:43.891 --> 15:48.433
Oh, hey, I, uh...
I remember this photo
from Peter's office.

15:48.433 --> 15:52.099
It's still so weird to me
that he and Gavin Belson
were ever friends.

15:55.433 --> 15:57.433
Select destination.

15:57.433 --> 16:00.850
-No. No, no. No, thank you.
-Optimizing route to Arallon.

16:02.349 --> 16:04.516
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Hold on.

16:04.516 --> 16:06.808
Wait. Are all these
Peter Gregory's notebooks?

16:06.808 --> 16:08.975
Um...
Are they?
Are they in this box?

16:08.975 --> 16:12.766
Richard. Remember,
you promised you were
gonna get some sleep tonight.

16:12.766 --> 16:14.016
Yeah, I will.

16:14.016 --> 16:16.224
All right, I'm, uh...
I'm gonna leave you guys to it.

16:16.224 --> 16:20.307
Oh, Erlich didn't get a call
from Ed Chen today, did he?

16:20.307 --> 16:22.599
Yeah. I heard them
on speakerphone,

16:22.599 --> 16:24.099
'cause Erlich
was neti-potting.

16:24.099 --> 16:26.307
I think, uh... I think
they're meeting tonight.

16:26.307 --> 16:27.724
Good to know.

16:29.224 --> 16:31.558
What?
Sesame seeds.

16:33.224 --> 16:35.057
To SeeFood.
To SeeFood

16:35.057 --> 16:37.641
and to a full-expensed meal
on Raviga's tab,

16:37.641 --> 16:41.433
and to you, Ed Chen,
who pulled the wool
over Laurie Bream's eyes

16:41.433 --> 16:44.516
and got us two-hundo-thou
sight unseen.

16:44.516 --> 16:48.141
Well, she had some concerns
about getting into business
with you again,

16:48.141 --> 16:51.307
but I can pretty much talk
that broad into anything.

16:51.307 --> 16:53.474
Ha! Cheers to that.

16:55.433 --> 16:57.391
You're a con man,
like Erlich!

16:57.391 --> 16:59.349
What does that mean?

16:59.349 --> 17:02.641
It-- it's a little
term of endearment
we have around the house.

17:02.641 --> 17:04.391
Uh, a confident man.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.348
He sees me
as a confident man,
and he looks up to me.

17:06.348 --> 17:09.641
You know, you have
to be patient with him,
'cause he's a bit of a moron.

17:09.641 --> 17:12.057
Moron?
No, no, no. I mean,
he's-- Not in tech.

17:12.057 --> 17:15.849
And how about this palapa?
Are we in the islands or what?

17:15.849 --> 17:17.473
Sorry. I--

17:17.473 --> 17:20.182
This app isn't
gonna suck, right?

17:20.182 --> 17:21.683
If it sucks,
it's my ass.

17:21.683 --> 17:24.141
You guys have
a working demo... right?

17:26.098 --> 17:27.641
Uh, we're gonna slow down

17:27.641 --> 17:31.266
on the, uh...
the-the-- the servings
for the little one.

17:31.266 --> 17:33.850
So, he's from China,
a small town,

17:33.850 --> 17:36.641
not used to our
big city liquor, and--
No, no, no, no, no.

17:36.641 --> 17:39.433
Jian-Yang.

17:44.307 --> 17:48.391
Boys, boys. Let's speak
in English. It's the law.

17:52.224 --> 17:55.933
"I'm a big fat fucking asshole."

17:55.933 --> 17:58.016
Okay, now.
That's-- that's me.

17:58.016 --> 18:00.599
Why would I call myself
a big fat asshole?

18:00.599 --> 18:02.307
The liquor's gotten
to the little fellow,

18:02.307 --> 18:04.391
and I wouldn't listen
to a word he has to say.

18:07.307 --> 18:10.474
Oh, hey, Gilfoyle.
This is Mia.

18:11.558 --> 18:12.975
Are you
gonna murder Dinesh?

18:13.933 --> 18:15.558
No.
Bummer.

18:16.558 --> 18:18.391
Wait. Gilfoyle?

18:18.391 --> 18:20.724
Are you the Gilfoyle
from Bovine Dawn?

18:20.724 --> 18:22.683
Maybe.

18:23.933 --> 18:25.224
I'm MI4.

18:25.224 --> 18:26.391
No shit.

18:26.391 --> 18:30.182
I always thought you were
a fat, bald weirdo.

18:30.182 --> 18:34.474
Well, she's not.
She's a thin,
hairy regular.

18:34.474 --> 18:36.266
You know, you were
totally wrong about the dump

18:36.266 --> 18:38.683
of all the hacking team's
best exploits.

18:38.683 --> 18:41.099
No, if you look
at what happened
with the Equation Group,

18:41.099 --> 18:42.933
it was basically
the same thing.

18:43.933 --> 18:45.433
She's right,
you're wrong.

18:45.433 --> 18:47.266
Um, shall we head out?

18:48.433 --> 18:49.724
Don't wait up.

18:51.266 --> 18:53.099
Oh, my God.

18:53.099 --> 18:56.433
Oh, my fucking God!
Richard, what is it?

18:56.433 --> 18:58.599
Jared, look.
It's all here.

18:58.599 --> 19:02.391
Peter Gregory knew
the value of a completely
decentralized Internet.

19:02.391 --> 19:05.558
I mean, Look, look.
"The Internet we deserve."

19:06.474 --> 19:08.433
I mean, look,
even back then,

19:08.433 --> 19:10.891
Peter was worried that
the Internet would become

19:10.891 --> 19:13.307
this shitty
corporate-controlled thing

19:13.307 --> 19:16.474
that-- that Hooli
and all these other companies
manipulate today.

19:16.474 --> 19:17.808
But the idea is real.

19:17.808 --> 19:20.433
It's just
that Peter didn't think
it was feasible

19:20.433 --> 19:23.433
unless compression surpassed
the theoretical limit

19:23.433 --> 19:25.182
of a 2.9 Weissman Score.

19:25.182 --> 19:27.349
We shattered that limit
at TechCrunch Disrupt.

19:27.349 --> 19:29.224
Yeah, baby. Exactly.
Ha!

19:29.224 --> 19:30.808
I mean, goddammit.
I always knew there was

19:30.808 --> 19:32.474
a perfect application
for my algorithm.

19:32.474 --> 19:34.891
These notes,
all this-- this is going
to save me months.

19:34.891 --> 19:37.641
This is it. I mean,
I was right all along.
I was right!

19:37.641 --> 19:39.724
Can I just...
Can I try something?

19:39.724 --> 19:42.307
Yeah.
Woo!

19:44.266 --> 19:46.016
Okay.
I don't know.

19:46.016 --> 19:47.516
Woo!
Woo!

19:47.516 --> 19:49.850
Woo! Woo!

19:51.224 --> 19:52.474
Woo!

19:54.349 --> 19:55.474
Sorry.
That's okay.

20:04.349 --> 20:06.933
So... do you like movies?

20:06.933 --> 20:08.975
Depends on the movie.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.683
I'm the exact same way.

20:10.683 --> 20:13.016
It being
a movie doesn't mean
I'm gonna like it.

20:13.016 --> 20:15.558
Would you care for some wine
or a cocktail tonight?

20:15.558 --> 20:17.558
Uh, just water, please.

20:17.558 --> 20:19.266
Just water, please.

20:22.474 --> 20:23.516
I love water.

20:24.516 --> 20:28.182
I do.
Oceans, rivers...

20:29.224 --> 20:30.433
lakes.

20:31.891 --> 20:35.349
When does a pond
become a lake?

20:36.933 --> 20:38.558
I wonder if it's depth.

20:41.558 --> 20:45.391
Where are those waters?
Felt like we ordered
waters a while ago.

20:45.391 --> 20:47.224
And-- What?

20:48.182 --> 20:49.516
Fucking prick.

20:50.433 --> 20:51.850
What?
Oh, nothing.

20:51.850 --> 20:53.641
It was just
a text from Gilfoyle.

20:53.641 --> 20:56.641
Gilfoyle isn't a prick.
Yeah, I'm sorry.

20:56.641 --> 20:58.474
He's a motherfucking prick.

20:59.558 --> 21:01.099
What?
That guy sucks.

21:01.099 --> 21:03.391
Everyone hates him
on the message boards.

21:03.391 --> 21:05.891
You know, putting a face
to the name made
so much sense.

21:05.891 --> 21:08.016
Right, 'cause
his face sucks, too.
Totally!

21:08.016 --> 21:10.891
Yeah.
I have to find this one
post of his. It was insane.

21:10.891 --> 21:12.266
You know,
he has no friends.

21:12.266 --> 21:13.766
He pretends like
he's all dry and witty,

21:13.766 --> 21:15.474
but he's just
a monotone piece of shit.

21:15.474 --> 21:17.433
And being a Satanist
just means you're ugly,

21:17.433 --> 21:18.599
and you're leaning into it.

21:18.599 --> 21:21.474
That's right.

21:21.474 --> 21:23.766
You know what?
Can I get a glass
of Malbec?

21:23.766 --> 21:25.808
Unless... Do you want
to get a bottle?

21:25.808 --> 21:27.516
Yeah. Let's get
a bottle of Malbec.

21:27.516 --> 21:29.599
Fucking Gilfoyle.
Right?

21:36.933 --> 21:38.808
Mr. Bighetti.

21:38.808 --> 21:42.224
When you're ready.
Uh, ready for what?

21:44.850 --> 21:46.891
I'm like
the class clown already.

21:48.224 --> 21:50.141
Why is my name
on the board?

21:53.099 --> 21:54.558
Oh, no.

21:56.307 --> 21:58.016
Laurie, you wanted
to see me?

21:58.016 --> 21:59.891
Oh. Yes, Monica, sit.

22:01.307 --> 22:02.808
Are you pregnant?

22:02.808 --> 22:05.516
Yes.
Congratulations.

22:06.433 --> 22:08.933
On?
On being pregnant.

22:10.057 --> 22:11.724
Oh. Yes.

22:11.724 --> 22:14.891
Friday afternoon,
Ed Chen convinced me

22:14.891 --> 22:18.099
to bid against Coleman Blair
on an app entitled SeeFood.

22:18.099 --> 22:22.558
It's run by Bachman
and the one who smoked
in the offices.

22:22.558 --> 22:25.891
Well, I--
Ed is very persuasive.

22:25.891 --> 22:27.808
This morning,
he made the case

22:27.808 --> 22:31.683
that since you have
a long-standing relationship
with Bachman,

22:31.683 --> 22:36.016
and since you are
a talented VC who deserves
a second chance--

22:36.016 --> 22:39.182
his words--
you should take lead.

22:40.558 --> 22:41.808
What?

22:41.808 --> 22:43.474
- ♪ ♪- I mean, look at this drawing.

22:43.474 --> 22:46.474
I drew the exact same thing
on my doctor's butt paper.

22:46.474 --> 22:49.182
I mean, Peter had
the exact same idea.

22:49.182 --> 22:51.349
He was just waiting
for compression to catch up,

22:51.349 --> 22:55.641
which it did,
thanks to me.

22:55.641 --> 22:57.182
Cheer up, Richard.

22:57.182 --> 22:59.099
Yes, but here's
the best part, okay?

22:59.099 --> 23:01.182
Peter never foresaw
the ubiquity

23:01.182 --> 23:03.516
of Internet connected
computing devices. Right?

23:03.516 --> 23:07.141
Camera, refrigerators,
TVs, baby monitors,

23:07.141 --> 23:11.933
not to mention the billions-plus
smartphones that are floating
around the world.

23:11.933 --> 23:13.641
I mean, who here
has a smartphone, right?

23:13.641 --> 23:17.391
You, you, me, Jian-Yang,
Dinesh, Monica...

23:17.391 --> 23:20.307
Richard, you don't have
to name everyone you know.

23:20.307 --> 23:23.516
Point is...
you all thought
I was crazy

23:23.516 --> 23:25.641
when I walked
into the swimming pool
with my clothes on,

23:25.641 --> 23:28.850
but it turns out
I was fucking right.

23:28.850 --> 23:31.891
Okay. So, not crazy.
Opposite. You poor idiots.

23:33.266 --> 23:34.683
How was school,
Timmy?

23:34.683 --> 23:37.391
Oh, not great.
They made me teach.

23:37.391 --> 23:39.850
Teach what?
Stanford.

23:39.850 --> 23:42.516
You're a professor
at Stanford now,
Big Head?

23:42.516 --> 23:45.349
- No, that would be crazy.
- I'm a guest lecturer.

23:49.516 --> 23:51.182
What are you doing?

23:51.182 --> 23:53.724
It was open,
and you have the keys.

23:53.724 --> 23:54.724
Huh.

23:55.641 --> 23:57.224
Strange.
Did you change the locks?

23:57.224 --> 24:01.099
'Cause the keys
were working last night
when I went for my date.

24:01.099 --> 24:05.182
'Cause I haven't
come back to the house
since my date, so...

24:08.099 --> 24:09.766
I did sex on her.

24:10.766 --> 24:12.933
Good.
Cool. Yeah,
that's great.

24:12.933 --> 24:14.891
Nice, man.
Who is she?

24:14.891 --> 24:19.141
Her name is Mia,
and she is a-Mia-zing.

24:19.141 --> 24:22.599
She hates Gilfoyle almost
as much as I do, so...

24:22.599 --> 24:28.224
Huh! Jumping headlong into
a sexual relationship with MI4.

24:28.224 --> 24:31.433
Ballsy. But I'm sure
you've thought through
the consequences.

24:31.433 --> 24:34.933
Well, we weren't really
doing a lot of thinking.
You know what I mean?

24:34.933 --> 24:37.724
Oh, wow.
Mia is a legit hacker.

24:37.724 --> 24:40.099
People say
that she's taken on
the Chinese government,

24:40.099 --> 24:43.474
and here you are,
after one meal,
in an intimate relationship.

24:43.474 --> 24:44.975
♪ ♪So?

24:44.975 --> 24:47.766
So what do you think
she'll do if you try
to break up with her?

24:47.766 --> 24:51.850
Or disagree with her?
Or disappoint her
in any way,

24:51.850 --> 24:55.057
like by confessing
that your badass takedown

24:55.057 --> 24:58.224
of Gavin Belson
was a total accident?

24:58.224 --> 25:00.349
Unless, you've already
told her.

25:01.307 --> 25:02.349
It didn't come up.

25:02.349 --> 25:04.433
Well, I'm sure
that when she finds out

25:04.433 --> 25:06.683
that your entire
relationship is based

25:06.683 --> 25:09.141
on a lie of omission,
she'll be very understanding.

25:09.141 --> 25:11.307
So what?
We just won't breakup.

25:11.307 --> 25:12.474

25:12.474 --> 25:14.307
Ever.

25:14.307 --> 25:16.433
Erlich.

Do you know how badly Ed Chen
just fucked me with Laurie?

25:19.766 --> 25:21.182
Let me
tell you something.

25:21.182 --> 25:24.016
A threesome
is always awkward,
especially the first one.

25:24.016 --> 25:25.349
Laurie being
a little bit older--

25:25.349 --> 25:29.182

Are you-- no.
No, no, no, no, no.

SeeFood has to be great.
My job depends on it.

25:38.433 --> 25:41.474
Ed Chen bailed and dumped
the whole thing on me.

25:41.474 --> 25:45.224
Richard, can I speak
with you in the kitchen
for a moment?

25:45.224 --> 25:46.307
Yup. Sure.

25:47.683 --> 25:49.558
So, what's up?

25:50.850 --> 25:52.558
Well, here's the thing.

25:53.975 --> 25:57.016
Remember that phone number
you were curious about in here?

25:57.016 --> 26:01.016
Well, it's not
a phone number.
It's a patent number.

26:01.016 --> 26:04.307
A patent for exactly what
you were planning to build.

26:04.307 --> 26:06.391
So Peter patented it.

26:06.391 --> 26:07.766
No, I, um...

26:07.766 --> 26:10.266
I spoke
to Brian Fong.
Who?

26:12.683 --> 26:14.141
Brian Fong.
Oh.

26:14.141 --> 26:17.558
And he told me
that Peter was very excited
about the idea,

26:17.558 --> 26:19.141
but there was
some resentment

26:19.141 --> 26:22.224
that he wasn't focused
more on what the team
was working on,

26:22.224 --> 26:25.474
so one of them went out
and got a patent on it.

26:25.474 --> 26:27.266
Why didn't this guy
pursue it?

26:27.266 --> 26:28.933
Well, the patent was
just a roadblock

26:28.933 --> 26:32.057
to keep Peter
focused on the company
they were starting...

26:32.057 --> 26:36.433
a company that went on
to be known as Hooli.

26:36.433 --> 26:38.141
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait. Sst!

26:39.641 --> 26:44.766
So you're telling me
that the perfect application
of my algorithm

26:44.766 --> 26:47.641
belongs to
Gavin fucking Belson?

26:47.641 --> 26:49.224
I'm afraid so.

26:57.933 --> 27:00.016
Richard,

27:00.016 --> 27:02.307
Uh, yes. Just putting
something away.

Yep. Not crazy.

Opposite.
