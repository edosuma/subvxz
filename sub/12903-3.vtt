WEBVTT

00:08.844 --> 00:11.912
God, they put those bathrooms so far...

00:11.945 --> 00:15.416
Uh, hon... what are you doing?

00:15.450 --> 00:18.252
I'm making out with... you?

00:18.286 --> 00:21.089
Then who is this?

00:21.121 --> 00:23.725
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, he's dead.

00:24.791 --> 00:26.091
W-Why are you still kissing him?

00:26.091 --> 00:27.326
I don't know!

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:36.927 --> 00:37.942
Rock and roll.

00:37.942 --> 00:39.578
Keep going! Move!

00:44.950 --> 00:45.984
Go, go, go!

00:46.017 --> 00:48.047
Geils, get down!

00:48.454 --> 00:50.578
I can't. If I stop bouncing,
he'll start crying.

00:52.356 --> 00:53.258
Tribeca.

00:53.292 --> 00:54.859
Right away.

00:54.892 --> 00:56.594
Another body just
washed up on the beach.

00:56.627 --> 00:57.662
Lieutenant wants us there.

00:57.695 --> 00:58.930
I can't go.

00:58.963 --> 01:00.198
I got his music class after this.

01:00.231 --> 01:01.766
Why does a baby need a music class?

01:01.800 --> 01:03.002
What, is he gonna start a band?

01:03.035 --> 01:04.402
Oh, you sleep for a
year and now you want

01:04.435 --> 01:05.937
to start making decisions
about his future?

01:05.970 --> 01:07.205
I was in a coma.

01:07.238 --> 01:08.606
You know what, I'm just exhausted.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.076
Just drop it.

01:10.109 --> 01:12.011
But I think someone
needs a diaper change.

01:12.059 --> 01:14.638
Sorry. This is my first raid.

01:19.118 --> 01:20.419
Hello, Angela.

01:20.452 --> 01:22.121
Hello, Monica.

01:22.154 --> 01:24.423
What happened to Mr. Handsome here?

01:24.462 --> 01:27.872
Sir Nathan Handsome washed up
on the shore 7:30 this morning.

01:27.905 --> 01:29.411
We have to assume that it's a drowning

01:29.412 --> 01:30.878
until the lab proves different.

01:30.911 --> 01:33.222
Isn't this the 11th drowning this month?

01:33.222 --> 01:34.224
12th, actually.

01:35.623 --> 01:38.493
This is Brad Wilson, head lifeguard.

01:38.527 --> 01:39.561
It's pronounced "Brah."

01:39.594 --> 01:41.329
Angie Tribeca, LAPD.

01:41.362 --> 01:45.001
Well, Angie, the ocean is the
biggest killer in this county.

01:45.034 --> 01:47.169
Maybe you should arrest
it and throw it in jail.

01:47.201 --> 01:49.605
Any explanation for the
uptick in drownings?

01:49.638 --> 01:52.508
You got a wicked northwest swell
crashing into a southwest rip.

01:52.540 --> 01:53.575
You do the math.

01:53.608 --> 01:55.277
12.

01:55.311 --> 01:57.546
Anyway, there's basically
nothing that can be done,

01:57.578 --> 01:58.914
so I say dig a hole, throw him in,

01:58.948 --> 02:00.549
and say aloha, the goodbye one.

02:00.581 --> 02:01.750
We might need you to come down

02:01.784 --> 02:03.052
to the station and make a statement.

02:03.084 --> 02:04.719
Sure, whatever you need.

02:04.752 --> 02:07.991
Meanwhile, we're shutting
down this beach.

02:09.258 --> 02:10.960
- You want to do what?!
- Close the beach.

02:10.991 --> 02:13.128
- Excuse me?
- Close the beach!

02:13.162 --> 02:14.796
I can't hear a thing
with these ear plugs.

02:14.830 --> 02:16.565
Mr. Mayor!

02:16.598 --> 02:18.701
We need to close every beach
in Los Angeles County.

02:18.734 --> 02:20.603
Atkins, have you lost your mind?

02:20.635 --> 02:23.472
That beach makes up 95%
of the city's revenue.

02:23.504 --> 02:25.707
Sir, we have had 12 drownings
in the last month.

02:25.741 --> 02:27.076
It is too dangerous!

02:27.109 --> 02:29.111
I was just there with
my family this weekend,

02:29.144 --> 02:30.646
and we had a heck of a time.

02:30.679 --> 02:32.480
Little Jimmy caught an I.V. bag.

02:32.514 --> 02:33.983
Damn it, Joe!

02:34.015 --> 02:36.051
Friday is supposed to be
the hottest day on record.

02:36.085 --> 02:37.954
Everybody and his brother's
gonna be out there!

02:38.784 --> 02:39.918
That beach stays open.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.430
My brother's coming this weekend,

02:41.430 --> 02:43.099
and I promised him we were gonna go.

02:43.100 --> 02:44.100
Is that clear?

02:44.135 --> 02:45.536
No, not really!

02:45.570 --> 02:48.106
Okay, 1 better or 2?

02:48.138 --> 02:50.608
Can I see them again?

02:52.376 --> 02:54.445
Okay, I just got him down for a nap.

02:54.479 --> 02:57.114
Now I just want to put my feet
up for two seconds.

02:59.416 --> 03:00.751
Hello?

03:00.785 --> 03:02.120
Hey, Monica.

03:02.153 --> 03:05.590
Yeah, I'm just, uh...
uh, reading him a book.

03:05.623 --> 03:07.959
Can I maybe call you back later?

03:07.992 --> 03:10.095
Yes, I'll be right there.

03:10.128 --> 03:12.231
Yes, I'll hurry.

03:13.498 --> 03:16.235
Turns out our guy didn't drown.

03:18.268 --> 03:20.404
All the fruit's grown locally.

03:20.438 --> 03:22.774
No preservatives, no added sugar.

03:23.563 --> 03:24.798
Oh, excuse me a moment.

03:24.831 --> 03:26.066
Geils, Tribeca.

03:26.098 --> 03:27.266
I'm glad you're here.

03:27.298 --> 03:30.469
Here lies drowning victim number 12.

03:30.503 --> 03:31.636
Or so we thought.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.139
Before we go any further,

03:33.171 --> 03:35.207
I think it just needs to be said
that this guy is ripped.

03:35.241 --> 03:37.910
Abs, pecs, Magic Mike V.

03:37.943 --> 03:41.380
I'm not saying I'm gay or
a necrophiliac, but if I was,

03:41.413 --> 03:43.249
I certainly wouldn't tell you guys.

03:43.282 --> 03:44.649
How do we know it isn't a drowning?

03:44.683 --> 03:47.286
A drowning victim's lungs
would be full of water.

03:47.319 --> 03:48.588
His were completely empty,

03:48.621 --> 03:50.322
which means he stopped breathing

03:50.356 --> 03:51.791
before he went in the ocean.

03:51.824 --> 03:52.925
What was the cause of death?

03:52.957 --> 03:54.593
- Heart attack.
- Heart attack?

03:54.627 --> 03:57.296
He looks 26, and he's in
the best shape of his life.

03:57.328 --> 03:58.998
He has an incredible body.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.800
The odds of an adult male under 30

04:00.832 --> 04:03.669
suffering a heart attack
is about 1 in every 780,000,

04:03.701 --> 04:08.306
unless there's something already
in the system to cause it.

04:08.339 --> 04:11.510
Scholls, let's run the
blood sample, shall we?

04:11.544 --> 04:12.712
Mm.

04:15.714 --> 04:18.184
O-positive. Iron content seems normal.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.086
White blood cell count
within a healthy range.

04:20.118 --> 04:22.188
There's something else in here.

04:22.221 --> 04:25.358
Possibly a combination of
fenfluramine and phentermine?

04:25.390 --> 04:26.926
More commonly known as Fen-Phen.

04:26.959 --> 04:28.661
A weight-loss drug?

04:28.693 --> 04:29.996
Wasn't that outlawed in 1997

04:30.036 --> 04:31.870
because it made people look too awesome?

04:31.897 --> 04:32.874
Yes.

04:32.874 --> 04:34.442
Fenfluramine was banned in the U.S.

04:34.475 --> 04:35.610
because of various side effects

04:35.643 --> 04:37.345
including dizziness, confusion,

04:37.378 --> 04:39.715
hypertension, and death.

04:39.748 --> 04:43.743
Ask your doctor if Fen-Phen
is right for you.

04:43.806 --> 04:46.643
Do not operate heavy
machinery while on Fen-Phen.

04:46.676 --> 04:50.446
If you're pregnant or nursing,
ask your doctor before taking.

04:50.479 --> 04:53.073
For an erection lasting
more than four hours,

04:53.074 --> 04:55.143
seek immediate medical attention.

04:55.175 --> 04:57.611
If you have a history of heart disease,

04:57.644 --> 04:58.879
do not take Fen-Phen,

04:58.913 --> 05:01.283
as it may exacerbate your condition.

05:02.423 --> 05:04.759
We re-checked the blood
of all the victims,

05:04.802 --> 05:06.987
and they all proved
positive for Fen-Phen.

05:07.021 --> 05:09.157
Someone is dealing diet
drugs on the beach.

05:09.189 --> 05:11.892
These people didn't drown.
They're dumped.

05:11.925 --> 05:14.995
Dumped like a girl in a coma.

05:15.028 --> 05:17.331
You were unconscious, she was conscious.

05:17.365 --> 05:19.333
Why do I have to keep explaining myself?

05:19.367 --> 05:21.575
I did what any rational man would do.

05:21.865 --> 05:23.237
I think about you when
I make love to her.

05:23.271 --> 05:24.672
What else do you want?

05:24.704 --> 05:26.507
God, I can't take this anymore.

05:26.540 --> 05:30.110
What was that, 10 minutes?
I'm losing my mind here.

05:30.143 --> 05:31.612
Didn't you hear him?

05:31.646 --> 05:34.182
He's having sex with me
when he thinks about you.

05:34.215 --> 05:37.318
Get over it. It's getting sad.

05:41.159 --> 05:43.260
Here's your stupid statement.

05:43.286 --> 05:44.387
Am I free to go?

05:44.420 --> 05:45.488
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:45.521 --> 05:46.824
Let me see what this is.

05:46.856 --> 05:49.659
"My Day at the Beach" by Brah Wilson.

05:49.692 --> 05:52.094
"My day at the beach was really fun.

05:52.127 --> 05:53.596
People played in the water.

05:53.629 --> 05:55.132
Then I had ice cream.

05:55.165 --> 05:57.990
It was fun. I love the beach.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.159
The end."

05:59.193 --> 06:00.428
That's it?

06:01.003 --> 06:02.739
12 corpses wash up on the beach

06:02.772 --> 06:04.654
and that's not enough
to keep you up at night?

06:04.655 --> 06:06.491
What can I say? I'm a chill dude.

06:06.525 --> 06:09.395
Well, since you're so chill,
I guess it wouldn't surprise you

06:09.428 --> 06:11.664
to learn that all those
people you said drowned

06:11.696 --> 06:14.836
actually overdosed on an
illegal weight-loss drug.

06:14.837 --> 06:16.238
I'd be surprised on the inside,

06:16.271 --> 06:18.740
but you wouldn't be able to tell
from my demeanor, no.

06:26.632 --> 06:28.687
I think you know something.

06:28.687 --> 06:30.089
And until you come clean,

06:30.090 --> 06:33.391
I got other ways of getting what I want.

06:33.425 --> 06:36.360
You want a statement,
I'll give you a statement.

06:36.394 --> 06:39.564
We live in a world with waves,
and people need to be protected

06:39.598 --> 06:41.934
from those waves by men in shorts.

06:41.966 --> 06:44.002
Who's gonna do it, you?

06:44.035 --> 06:47.115
You, Lieutenant Weinberg?

06:47.116 --> 06:49.385
You ever saved a life, Detective?

06:49.418 --> 06:51.320
- Many.
- I didn't think so.

06:51.354 --> 06:54.423
I look at the ugliest
parts of humanity...

06:54.457 --> 06:56.526
littering, cellulite,

06:56.558 --> 06:59.428
an utter disregard for
the rules of volleyball.

06:59.462 --> 07:04.099
But in spite of it all, I say,
"You're not gonna die today.

07:04.132 --> 07:07.503
Not on my beach. Brah has got you."

07:07.544 --> 07:09.713
Well, I know 12 corpses
that might disagree.

07:09.738 --> 07:11.907
And I don't appreciate
being questioned by a man

07:11.940 --> 07:14.777
who has the luxury of working on land.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.745
My enemy never stops.

07:16.779 --> 07:19.281
He keeps coming and coming.

07:29.325 --> 07:33.695
And when it comes for
you, which it will,

07:33.729 --> 07:37.967
you better pray I'm
there to pull you out.

07:40.837 --> 07:43.209
So, unless I'm under arrest...

07:46.036 --> 07:48.706
I got a beach to patrol.

07:53.013 --> 07:54.881
Someone's dealing banned
weight-loss drugs.

07:54.914 --> 07:56.650
People O.D., they get
dumped in the water,

07:56.683 --> 07:58.284
the lifeguards call it a drowning.

07:58.318 --> 07:59.466
I'll tell you this right now...

07:59.467 --> 08:02.214
Brah Wilson knows a hell of a lot
more than what he's letting on.

08:02.214 --> 08:03.883
Not a hell of a lot more, but more.

08:03.916 --> 08:05.857
I think we need to get someone
undercover with the lifeguards.

08:05.883 --> 08:07.452
That person would have
to spend every day

08:07.484 --> 08:08.720
at the beach away from their family.

08:08.753 --> 08:11.022
It would require a ton of sleep

08:11.054 --> 08:12.357
and probably no hassles.

08:12.390 --> 08:14.125
I can't in good conscience
ask anyone to do that.

08:14.157 --> 08:16.760
I'll do it, Lieutenant.

08:16.794 --> 08:19.764
Geils, you have a baby
and a love triangle.

08:19.797 --> 08:22.066
Think about what you'd be giving up.

08:36.337 --> 08:38.140
Hey. How's it going, guys?

08:38.140 --> 08:40.337
I'm the new lifeguard, Jay Geils.

08:40.337 --> 08:42.039
Papers, please.

08:55.552 --> 08:56.888
Welcome to Malibu.

08:57.558 --> 08:59.894
Just having paperwork doesn't
make you a lifeguard.

08:59.926 --> 09:01.228
We're a brotherhood.

09:01.261 --> 09:03.763
How do we know you got what it takes?

09:04.039 --> 09:05.908
I guess just assume I do?

09:05.934 --> 09:07.734
We're gonna need to see a rescue.

09:08.464 --> 09:11.134
See that middle-aged Asian
man out in the surf?

09:11.160 --> 09:13.050
He's been flailing since
you walked in here.

09:13.050 --> 09:15.186
I give him ten minutes
till he goes under.

09:16.554 --> 09:18.289
Not so fast, hot-shot.

09:18.321 --> 09:21.058
I also got a Midwestern couple
about to pull glass bottles

09:21.092 --> 09:22.794
out of their cooler over there.

09:22.825 --> 09:24.837
- What do you do?
- I mean...

09:24.838 --> 09:27.675
What do you do?

09:32.077 --> 09:33.947
No glass on the beach!

09:41.353 --> 09:45.592
All right. Look who it is!

09:47.760 --> 09:50.663
Everybody, this is the new
member of our crew.

09:50.696 --> 09:54.901
Geils, I want you to meet Todd,
Skeeter, Wilhelm, Stacy,

09:54.933 --> 09:59.672
Lukabubude, Martinez, the
other Stacy, L'Monjello...

09:59.704 --> 10:02.841
- Yo.
- Oranjello, and Man Stacy.

10:02.875 --> 10:03.909
Glad to meet you guys.

10:03.943 --> 10:05.712
I just hope we can all work together

10:05.745 --> 10:07.212
to keep these beaches safe.

10:09.816 --> 10:12.851
I like him! He's crazy.

10:12.885 --> 10:14.120
Come with me.

10:14.153 --> 10:17.356
I want to talk to you some
place a little more private.

10:17.390 --> 10:19.958
So, what's your regime?

10:20.751 --> 10:22.154
I'm a Stalin guy.

10:22.180 --> 10:25.240
What? No. I mean your workout regime.

10:25.240 --> 10:26.434
Oh, you mean "regimen."

10:26.435 --> 10:28.569
Yeah, a lot of people get that confused.

10:28.603 --> 10:30.838
Just some weights, a little treadmill.

10:30.872 --> 10:32.740
We're gonna need you
to step it up a bit.

10:32.772 --> 10:35.442
We got a mantra out here, unspoken rule

10:35.476 --> 10:38.279
passed down from generation
to generation...

10:38.311 --> 10:39.713
"No fatties."

10:40.882 --> 10:42.516
Doesn't that seem insensitive in light

10:42.550 --> 10:44.486
of modern-day acceptance
of different body types?

10:44.518 --> 10:46.587
We're all for people
with different body types,

10:46.621 --> 10:48.590
just not on the beach.
We call those "inside people."

10:48.622 --> 10:50.592
I guess I could add in some more cardio.

10:50.625 --> 10:52.527
Cardio's not gonna cut it, my brother.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.529
Out here, where every second counts,

10:54.561 --> 10:57.297
we got to kick things up a notch.

10:57.330 --> 10:58.765
What is this?

10:58.799 --> 11:01.369
Trust me, Jay. I'm about
to show you a world

11:01.401 --> 11:03.437
you're not gonna believe even existed...

11:03.470 --> 11:06.874
endless sun, chill vibes, hot bodies,

11:06.907 --> 11:09.310
no responsibilities, no
babies, and no girlfriends.

11:17.151 --> 11:18.285
Who was that?

11:18.319 --> 11:19.954
Nobody.

11:22.924 --> 11:24.058
Now jump in the fire.

11:24.090 --> 11:25.826
What?

11:25.859 --> 11:27.862
I know who's dealing the drugs.

11:28.728 --> 11:30.064
It's me.

11:31.332 --> 11:33.468
Face down, maggot!

11:33.501 --> 11:35.470
You're going away for
a long time, scumbag.

11:35.502 --> 11:37.305
All right! I'll talk, I'll talk!

11:37.338 --> 11:38.673
Hang on. Let's hear what he has to say.

11:40.007 --> 11:40.837
It's the lifeguards.

11:40.837 --> 11:42.139
They're dealing Fen-Phen on the beach

11:42.171 --> 11:43.473
so everyone will be fit and attractive

11:43.506 --> 11:45.497
and also presumably to make money.

11:45.523 --> 11:47.092
Great. Let's take 'em down.

11:47.118 --> 11:47.985
Wait a second!

11:47.985 --> 11:49.521
We don't know how they're
getting the drugs

11:49.554 --> 11:50.789
or how they're connected to the bodies

11:50.822 --> 11:52.290
or even who's running this whole thing.

11:52.601 --> 11:54.070
What are you proposing?

11:54.096 --> 11:56.360
Give me another week
with them, 10 days tops,

11:56.394 --> 11:58.296
two weeks on the absolute outside.

11:58.337 --> 12:00.211
Let's make it a month, just to be safe.

12:00.239 --> 12:01.572
I go in deep with the lifeguards,

12:01.598 --> 12:03.350
figure out their operations,

12:03.655 --> 12:05.737
six years later, we take
the whole thing down.

12:06.097 --> 12:07.732
All right. Let's give it a shot.

12:07.849 --> 12:10.909
But I want you to check
in once a week, Geils.

12:11.742 --> 12:13.812
All right. Let's do this. Hands in.

13:12.335 --> 13:14.305
Hey.

13:14.338 --> 13:15.673
Tribeca, what are you doing here?

13:15.705 --> 13:17.274
They probably shouldn't
see me talking to you.

13:17.308 --> 13:19.140
You missed your last check-in.

13:19.351 --> 13:21.053
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that, bro.

13:21.086 --> 13:22.368
Nothing to report, really.

13:22.369 --> 13:25.529
"Nothing to report?"
"Bro?" "Sorry about that?"

13:25.662 --> 13:26.575
"Oh, yeah?"

13:27.242 --> 13:29.311
Maybe you and I should go
back to the office and talk.

13:29.352 --> 13:33.065
Can't do it, man. This is my office now.

13:33.090 --> 13:35.090
Come on in.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.153
Have a seat.

13:39.653 --> 13:40.788
You want anything to drink?

13:40.821 --> 13:42.724
Water?

13:42.757 --> 13:45.627
So, how's it going, Tribeca?

13:45.659 --> 13:47.962
Busy? Too busy to hit the gym?

13:47.995 --> 13:49.297
Stress eating?

13:49.330 --> 13:50.831
Don't take this the wrong way,

13:50.864 --> 13:52.633
but you're looking a little nourished.

13:52.667 --> 13:54.333
Geils, you look terrible.

13:54.521 --> 13:55.990
What the hell are they doing to you?

13:55.991 --> 13:56.859
Jealous much?

13:56.892 --> 13:58.227
All right, that's it.

13:58.259 --> 14:00.128
This operation is over.
You're coming in.

14:00.161 --> 14:02.165
I'm not going anywhere.
This is where I belong.

14:02.198 --> 14:04.467
Out here I'm free. Out
here I don't have to lie.

14:04.499 --> 14:05.634
Lie about what?

14:05.667 --> 14:08.137
Everything... my feelings for Scholls,

14:08.170 --> 14:10.901
me and her raising our
Canadian love child,

14:10.927 --> 14:12.330
my feeling for you...

14:12.363 --> 14:15.565
In summary, I'm just super
tired of all the lying.

14:15.599 --> 14:17.600
Out here I can be myself...

14:17.633 --> 14:20.470
a 95-pound undercover cop
pretending to be a lifeguard

14:20.503 --> 14:23.907
who lives by one motto... "No fatties."

14:23.940 --> 14:26.444
Jesus. Your nose is bleeding.

14:28.065 --> 14:28.617
Oh, yeah.

14:28.643 --> 14:31.515
Brah says that's just fat
trying to get out of my face.

14:31.547 --> 14:32.802
You're crazy sunburnt.

14:32.802 --> 14:36.139
Wrong. Just my false self shedding away.

14:36.961 --> 14:38.930
Listen, I know things are
complicated right now,

14:38.962 --> 14:40.764
but you can't just run
away from your life

14:40.798 --> 14:42.732
and, like, build a whole
new life out of sand.

14:42.765 --> 14:45.469
Too late, Tribeca. I'm home.
This is permanent.

14:45.503 --> 14:48.540
I got it again! Oof! Whoa.

15:03.509 --> 15:05.745
We got a traitor in our midst.

15:08.048 --> 15:10.018
Let's keep the murmuring to a minimum.

15:10.051 --> 15:13.888
Turns out, someone we thought
was our brother in red

15:13.921 --> 15:16.291
is actually a boy in blue.

15:16.323 --> 15:17.791
Police?

15:17.825 --> 15:19.961
You know what we do with traitors?

15:21.763 --> 15:23.565
Send them home!

15:23.597 --> 15:25.399
Send them home!

15:25.432 --> 15:26.735
Send them home!

15:26.768 --> 15:29.303
Oh, we're gonna send
them home all right...

15:29.336 --> 15:30.905
in a body bag.

15:32.472 --> 15:33.641
Watch it.

15:34.941 --> 15:39.581
Turns out Wilhelm was actually
"Bill Helm," secret police.

15:39.614 --> 15:42.316
What a waste of a hard body.

15:42.350 --> 15:44.853
Start digging.

15:47.056 --> 15:50.416
It sounds like Geils is completely
gone, a total write off.

15:50.416 --> 15:53.105
I wouldn't be surprised if we find
his bloated corpse floating in...

15:53.105 --> 15:54.440
Hey! Monica.

15:54.472 --> 15:55.640
How's it going?

15:55.673 --> 15:56.976
What's happening with the...

15:57.009 --> 15:58.811
dead people and the forensics and stuff?

15:58.843 --> 15:59.778
How's Geils doing?

15:59.812 --> 16:01.547
He is so good.

16:02.114 --> 16:03.816
Tell him... to her, Tribeca.

16:03.848 --> 16:04.949
He's great.

16:04.982 --> 16:06.618
Firmly attached to the grid,

16:06.651 --> 16:08.353
still super "coppy."

16:08.386 --> 16:09.487
He's...

16:09.655 --> 16:12.694
Tribeca, I know you might have your
problems with me after what happened...

16:12.694 --> 16:14.663
the accident, the coma,
the repeated intercourse

16:14.695 --> 16:17.398
with your boyfriend, some of
it in your hospital room...

16:17.424 --> 16:20.495
but I would hope that you still
have enough respect left for me

16:20.521 --> 16:21.923
to tell me the truth.

16:21.955 --> 16:24.691
He pooped on the beach
and buried it like a cat.

16:24.725 --> 16:26.175
I see.

16:26.176 --> 16:28.311
Tribeca, I want you to
coordinate with Malibu police,

16:28.345 --> 16:30.513
SWAT, Sea Org, and local Chabad.

16:30.547 --> 16:31.981
Take the lifeguards down.

16:32.014 --> 16:33.182
Copy that, Lieutenant.

16:33.215 --> 16:36.018
Don't worry. We'll bring him back.

16:36.052 --> 16:37.421
I think we both know the only person

16:37.454 --> 16:38.789
who can bring him back is you.

16:38.821 --> 16:40.323
That's not true.

16:40.356 --> 16:43.292
What Geils and I had is over.

16:43.326 --> 16:45.595
You guys are a family now.

16:45.629 --> 16:49.099
He just needs to be reminded of that.

16:49.132 --> 16:50.901
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

16:52.134 --> 16:53.424
Take them down.

17:00.644 --> 17:02.480
Hey, Geils!

17:02.514 --> 17:04.983
It's gonna be a good day!

17:19.065 --> 17:20.532
Shh!

17:20.566 --> 17:24.441
Wait for my signal on
five... four... three...

17:24.441 --> 17:25.477
ten!

17:25.509 --> 17:26.478
Nine... eight...

17:26.510 --> 17:28.046
seven... six... five...

17:28.078 --> 17:30.748
four... three... two one... go, go, go!

17:39.723 --> 17:42.726
Get down on your knees!

17:42.759 --> 17:44.261
Grab him!

17:44.295 --> 17:46.163
Freeze!

17:47.265 --> 17:49.066
No. No, no. It's okay.

17:49.100 --> 17:49.834
He's a cop!

17:49.866 --> 17:52.269
I'm not a cop!

17:52.303 --> 17:54.439
I'm a lifeguard.

17:55.573 --> 17:56.740
I'll take it from here.

17:56.774 --> 17:58.677
- Geils.
- Put the gun down, Brah.

17:58.710 --> 18:00.245
It's okay, Detective, I'm a cop.

18:00.277 --> 18:01.613
Malibu PD.

18:01.645 --> 18:03.013
I've been undercover for four years

18:03.046 --> 18:04.382
trying to clean up this beach,

18:04.414 --> 18:05.883
and you guys just blew
my entire operation.

18:05.916 --> 18:08.018
Hey, this guy's got a badge!

18:08.052 --> 18:11.683
- Alberto Martinez, ATF.
- Stacy Galina, FBI.

18:11.709 --> 18:14.679
Mama Lukabubude, ADT Security Services.

18:14.712 --> 18:18.016
Is anyone here an actual
drug-dealing lifeguard?

18:18.050 --> 18:19.717
Yeah. Me.

18:19.750 --> 18:22.120
Catch me if you can.

18:22.153 --> 18:23.287
Geils! No!

18:23.321 --> 18:24.523
He's getting away!

18:24.555 --> 18:26.691
LAPD. I need your paddle and ball.

18:26.725 --> 18:27.525
Sure, Mister.

18:41.105 --> 18:43.975
Geils.

18:44.008 --> 18:47.312
I told you I wasn't going back,
Tribeca, and I meant it.

18:47.344 --> 18:49.714
I'm gonna make people thin and fit.

18:49.747 --> 18:52.150
And don't even try an
object lesson on me,

18:52.183 --> 18:53.518
'cause it's not gonna work.

18:53.552 --> 18:55.554
Okay, fine. I won't even try.

18:55.586 --> 18:59.257
But I want you to take a look
at something... over there.

19:04.962 --> 19:06.692
Monica...

19:06.692 --> 19:08.162
and our baby.

19:08.194 --> 19:10.297
It's his first beach day.

19:10.329 --> 19:12.031
Look closer.

19:12.065 --> 19:15.369
Wait a second. What's
baby Angela wearing?

19:15.402 --> 19:17.970
A jacket and long pants?

19:18.003 --> 19:20.073
On the hottest day of the year?

19:20.106 --> 19:22.742
He's self-conscious about his curves.

19:22.776 --> 19:24.077
Curves?

19:24.111 --> 19:26.980
No. No, not curves.
That's just baby fat.

19:27.012 --> 19:29.682
He's... he's a beautiful, perfect baby.

19:29.715 --> 19:32.251
In today's day and age, even
a baby can have a great body

19:32.285 --> 19:34.354
and still feel insecure
because we're surrounded

19:34.386 --> 19:36.856
by unrealistic expectations of
what "perfect" looks like.

19:36.890 --> 19:38.057
No, no, no, no.

19:38.090 --> 19:40.560
Babies are supposed to be fat...

19:40.594 --> 19:41.894
and some people, too.

19:41.928 --> 19:44.732
"No fatties," Geils. Remember?

19:44.765 --> 19:48.102
Oh, my God. What have I done?

19:49.536 --> 19:51.705
It's all right, partner.

19:51.738 --> 19:53.240
Nothing we can't undo.

19:54.030 --> 19:55.966
Except for Brad executing
that German guy.

19:55.999 --> 19:58.169
We're just gonna have to
sweep that under the rug.

19:58.201 --> 20:01.005
It's just nice not to have
to lie for a while.

20:01.037 --> 20:03.974
Someday, maybe we won't have to.

20:04.715 --> 20:06.418
Now go hug our baby.

20:07.919 --> 20:10.255
Oh, Geils? Here.

20:10.287 --> 20:12.856
Oh that looks good.

20:12.890 --> 20:15.560
Ohh! Mmm. Mmm.

20:26.536 --> 20:29.506
Tribeca! A little help here.

20:29.540 --> 20:31.676
I think I buried myself too deep.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.745
Hoffman!
