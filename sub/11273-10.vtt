WEBVTT

00:02.600 --> 00:05.717
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:06.120 --> 00:07.838
Okay, Mr Peterson, it's your turn

00:08.000 --> 00:10.719
to send a tape-recorded hello
to my folks back home.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.638
I don't know what
to say here, Woody.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.870
Just hurry it up, will you.
I've got some audio gems

00:16.040 --> 00:18.759
that'll have them howling
in the old Hoosier state.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.112
Okay, just let me find the end
of Miss Chambers' message here.

00:22.280 --> 00:23.508
Alrighty.

00:23.680 --> 00:26.069
Your son is
a hardworking young man.

00:26.240 --> 00:28.674
You should be proud.
We at Cheers certainly are.

00:28.840 --> 00:30.512
And what's more--

00:31.040 --> 00:32.996
I think it's a little further along here.

00:33.640 --> 00:37.076
I believe it was Elizabeth
Barrett Browning who said--

00:40.080 --> 00:42.594
Now let me tell you
a little bit about myself.

00:43.760 --> 00:46.911
All right, fill me up, Woody.
I think we're in here for a while.

01:57.520 --> 02:00.671
Okeydokey, Mr Peterson, found
the end of Miss Chambers' message.

02:00.840 --> 02:02.512
It's ready to go.

02:03.200 --> 02:06.272
Hi, folks. This is Norm.

02:10.919 --> 02:13.514
Oh, no, that's the end of the tape.

02:13.680 --> 02:15.716
Sorry you didn't get
to leave your whole message.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.916
That was the whole message.

02:18.120 --> 02:20.111
Oh, thanks.

02:20.280 --> 02:23.192
Sam, two Beefeater martinis, please.

02:26.040 --> 02:28.918
Well, you're just
bubbling with energy.

02:29.080 --> 02:33.995
You must've mastered the childproof
cap on your Flintstones vitamins.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.592
That's pretty cute, Diane.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.911
Scored again.

02:41.880 --> 02:44.235
Yeah, I guess
I'll be saying that a lot tonight.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.916
You got an evening
of romance planned, Sam?

02:48.080 --> 02:49.718
Yeah, I sure do.

02:50.360 --> 02:52.316
Who's the bimbo du jour?

02:57.600 --> 02:59.192
That's the girl, all right.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.750
Claudia's been a tough nut to crack.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.673
But tonight's the night
she's gonna be enjoying

03:04.840 --> 03:08.469
all the rides in
Sammy's magic kingdom.

03:09.120 --> 03:12.430
She's in for a Mickey Mouse
evening with Goofy as her guide.

03:14.840 --> 03:17.149
Boy, Sam, I wish I could
read women like you.

03:17.320 --> 03:20.039
I mean, I can never really
tell when a woman likes me.

03:20.240 --> 03:24.358
Well, Woody, women give off
different subtle signs of interest.

03:24.520 --> 03:28.752
Me, I stand there naked
with a rose in my teeth.

03:29.120 --> 03:31.475
I'll watch for that one.

03:31.640 --> 03:34.108
So, Sam, what signal
is your date giving you?

03:34.280 --> 03:37.033
Not only is Claudia
mentally undressing me,

03:37.320 --> 03:39.834
she's mentally fixing me
breakfast the next morning.

03:43.960 --> 03:47.475
I'm sorry this is taking so long here.
I hope you're not getting bored.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.358
Oh, no. I enjoy watching you work.

03:49.520 --> 03:53.559
I'm glad to hear that. I've got some
mirrors at home. We can both watch.

03:57.480 --> 04:00.517
One second. Yeah.
Yeah, as a matter of fact he is.

04:00.680 --> 04:03.797
Hold on one second, will you.
Cliffie, telephone.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.952
Somebody wants to talk to Cliff?

04:07.120 --> 04:10.510
Cliffie. This is a first, bud. I don't think
anyone's ever called you here before.

04:10.680 --> 04:13.319
Yeah, I know who this is.
It's a tootsie on my route

04:13.480 --> 04:16.916
who's been eyeing the cut of my jib
through her Levolors.

04:19.160 --> 04:23.073
Her old man's probably out of town,
she's looking for a little C.O.D.:

04:23.560 --> 04:25.596
Cliffie on demand.

04:27.160 --> 04:29.151
I know how to handle this babe.

04:29.320 --> 04:30.992
Hello.

04:31.760 --> 04:36.072
Listen, I never wanna speak to you
again as long as I live. Goodbye.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.232
- Who was that?
- That was a man

04:39.400 --> 04:41.868
who has the nerve
to call himself my father.

04:42.320 --> 04:45.073
He'd have to have nerve
to admit that.

04:45.440 --> 04:47.396
Are you still carrying a grudge?

04:47.560 --> 04:49.437
Damn straight.

04:49.640 --> 04:53.076
How would you feel if your father
deserted you at the formative age of 9?

04:53.400 --> 04:55.630
Cliff, don't you at least wanna
hear what he has to say?

04:55.800 --> 04:58.917
- Perhaps he's trying to make amends.
- No way.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.555
I don't wanna have anything
to do with that bum.

05:01.720 --> 05:04.393
Well, I know how these
father/son relationships can be.

05:04.640 --> 05:07.154
My dad didn't want me
to get serious with Vera.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.669
- He heard she had loose morals.
- You're kidding me.

05:09.880 --> 05:13.156
Actually, he got the story wrong.
Turns out she had loose molars.

05:16.200 --> 05:18.998
At least you had
a father figure, Norm.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.557
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well.

05:23.640 --> 05:27.519
- Sam.
- Five minutes, we'll be out of here.

05:28.080 --> 05:33.359
What's this? A date of yours
reading Artforum magazine.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.315
And it's right side up too.

05:38.560 --> 05:42.348
Hope this doesn't mean that we're
gonna have to talk afterwards.

05:43.280 --> 05:45.669
Why do I keep trying
to communicate with you?

05:45.880 --> 05:48.553
It must be
the Margaret Mead in me.

05:51.160 --> 05:52.832
That's a wonderful issue.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.230
Yes, it is.

05:55.720 --> 05:59.554
Did you happen to read their article
on Chinese tapestries?

05:59.720 --> 06:02.359
- Yes, it was fascinating.
- Wasn't it?

06:02.520 --> 06:07.071
Yeah, the only problem was that 20
minutes later, I wanted to read it again.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.391
Reads and has a sense of humour.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.073
Did you lose a bet?

06:14.280 --> 06:15.793
Excuse me?

06:17.400 --> 06:19.868
- I'm Diane Chambers.
- Claudia Mitchell.

06:20.400 --> 06:23.517
So you and Sam are going out?

06:23.720 --> 06:27.156
Yes, we're gonna try that
new lndian restaurant, Rajah's.

06:27.360 --> 06:30.989
Oh, I understand their chef
is a master of tandoori cooking.

06:31.360 --> 06:34.033
Well, I don't really know
that much about lndian food.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.714
It's the one area where I'm not
really able to be pretentious.

06:36.920 --> 06:39.309
Well, I am, so we have
the bases covered.

06:39.920 --> 06:42.514
- Mind if I sit down?
- Please.

06:42.760 --> 06:44.830
Oh, yeah, and after all,
the game of billiards

06:45.000 --> 06:47.958
was invented by the ancient
Phoenicians, Norm.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.554
Well, however, it did gain
newfound popularity

06:50.720 --> 06:54.633
after a group of
Benedictine monks invented felt.

06:56.440 --> 06:57.919
Thank you, Sam.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.717
Good Lord.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.110
I think that's my father.

07:04.680 --> 07:06.716
There's still time to slip out
the bathroom window.

07:06.920 --> 07:11.072
No, no, no. I wanna hear what the rat
has to say. Don't let out who I am.

07:13.040 --> 07:16.112
- Can I help you?
- Do you happen to know Cliff Clavin?

07:16.800 --> 07:18.597
I...

07:18.920 --> 07:20.558
I...

07:21.320 --> 07:23.788
Sam, I'm no good under pressure.

07:25.120 --> 07:29.079
- Hi, I'm Sam Malone. I'm the owner.
- Oh, hi. I'm Cliff Sr, his father.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.879
I called his ma, she said he hangs
out here sometimes. Is he around?

07:32.080 --> 07:35.675
Well, no. Actually he's not.
I think he's away on business.

07:35.840 --> 07:38.149
- Yeah.
- Too bad. I wanted to talk to him.

07:38.680 --> 07:41.319
It's funny. My own son. I don't even
know what he does for a living.

07:41.480 --> 07:42.959
I don't even know
what he looks like.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.758
Cliff might be away for a while here.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.832
Is there any message
you'd like me to give to him?

07:49.040 --> 07:52.999
I'll hang around a while. It's kind of
personal. I'd like to deliver it myself.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.156
- Oh, yeah, here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

07:59.760 --> 08:01.478
Excuse me.

08:02.760 --> 08:04.432
I got something to say.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.239
Could I have the sports page?

08:08.440 --> 08:11.193
Oh, yeah, sure. Here you are.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.400
Boy, you two seem to be
getting along.

08:30.880 --> 08:34.155
- Are you ready?
- Oh, not to mention willing and able.

08:34.320 --> 08:35.308
I'll be at the...

08:37.720 --> 08:39.711
Hey, I have this great idea.

08:39.880 --> 08:42.269
Why don't we invite Diane
to come with us for dinner.

08:42.919 --> 08:46.310
- What?
- No, I don't think that'd be a good idea.

08:46.520 --> 08:48.750
No, don't be silly. It would be perfect.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.797
Diane knows all about lndian food.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.073
Oh, hey, so do l. I'll order buffalo,
you can have the Geronimo burger.

08:56.680 --> 09:00.355
Claudia, I really don't
want to be a third wheel.

09:00.600 --> 09:03.717
- Yeah, but I want you to come.
- Yeah, but I want us to be alone.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.996
Well, there's plenty
of time for that later.

09:06.160 --> 09:08.594
Besides, what could you do
in a restaurant full of people?

09:09.080 --> 09:11.275
You'd be surprised.

09:11.560 --> 09:14.950
- Yes, you would.
- Why don't you just butt out of this--

09:15.120 --> 09:19.113
Look, Sam, I think you're being
kind of a drip about this.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.636
Quite frankly, I am surprised at you.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.837
Oh. Well, all right.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.675
Diane, if you have nothing better to do
than tag along, why don't you join us.

09:28.880 --> 09:32.714
- I really don't think--
- No, please, Diane. I insist.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.757
- lt'll be fun.
- Yeah, loads.

09:35.680 --> 09:37.796
- Great, then we're set.
- Okay.

09:37.960 --> 09:41.555
- I'm gonna go freshen up.
- Okeydoke.

09:41.720 --> 09:43.597
- Please get me out of this.
- No, no.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.360
If you don't go, she'll think
that I told you not to go.

09:46.520 --> 09:49.637
And then she's gonna think I'm
even a bigger heel. You're going.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.955
Okay. Fine. Fine.

09:53.120 --> 09:56.715
You bet, "Fine. Fine."
Give me the phone, will you.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.839
- Sam, you're out of your mind.
- Hey, please.

10:00.040 --> 10:03.157
I may look stupid,
but I'm way ahead of her.

10:03.320 --> 10:05.390
Give me some credit
for having brains. Hello.

10:06.880 --> 10:08.518
Hello.

10:08.680 --> 10:10.477
Yeah, this is Sam Malone.

10:10.640 --> 10:13.871
I made a reservation
for two at 7::00.

10:14.080 --> 10:17.470
I wanna make sure it's an intimate
table that seats only two.

10:17.640 --> 10:20.234
Yeah, and there'll be
a third person coming along,

10:20.400 --> 10:24.837
but I wanna make sure
that she's seated far away.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.477
Yeah, no, no.
The farther the better.

10:27.640 --> 10:29.471
In fact, do you have
something in Bombay?

10:30.160 --> 10:33.038
- Goodbye.
- You're a genius.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.196
I kind of think
I'm wasting my time here.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.237
If Cliffie comes in,
tell him I was here.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.277
Thanks for the beer.

10:39.440 --> 10:41.749
- Aren't you gonna say something?
- I've got nothing to say.

10:41.960 --> 10:44.758
Mr Clavin, maybe Cliff
will call you later.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.752
Well,

10:46.920 --> 10:49.593
he'd better make it fast.
I'm leaving tomorrow.

10:49.760 --> 10:51.113
Gee, it's too bad.

10:51.280 --> 10:54.192
I'd really like to make my peace
with the kid. Well, thanks anyway.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.350
Hold it right there, Clavin.

11:05.760 --> 11:07.512
I'm Cliff Clavin Jr.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.758
You're Cliff.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.270
You wasted your time coming here.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.955
After what you've done, there can be
no peace between us. Hit the bricks.

11:18.520 --> 11:20.192
Cliffie.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.711
- What?
- What's that?

11:24.040 --> 11:26.110
- Where?
- Gotcha!

11:28.120 --> 11:30.634
Oh, Dad, you always knew
how to push the right buttons.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.631
Hey.

11:42.120 --> 11:44.350
I just can't stop
talking about that meal.

11:44.560 --> 11:47.028
It was simple and delicate,
yet provocative.

11:47.200 --> 11:50.033
Well, I never had anything
quite like that lamb vindaloo.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.555
Great recommendation, Diane.

11:52.760 --> 11:54.193
How was your meal, Sam?

11:54.360 --> 11:58.148
The only thing that tasted good at the
table turned out later to be a candle.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.709
You're not still angry
about sitting alone?

12:05.680 --> 12:08.672
I wasn't alone. You're forgetting
about that 300-pound Hindu

12:08.840 --> 12:10.751
with the goitre that kept fanning me.

12:11.280 --> 12:15.159
Look, Sam, I know this date hasn't
turned out the way you planned it.

12:15.320 --> 12:18.676
Well, maybe we could still salvage
something of the evening.

12:18.840 --> 12:21.400
Maybe we could go
someplace for dessert.

12:22.520 --> 12:26.593
If I might make a suggestion, why
don't you two go upstairs to Melville's.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.591
They have great cheesecake.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.313
I have a better idea.

12:30.520 --> 12:33.671
Why don't we go over to my place
for a little Sammy's jubilee.

12:34.440 --> 12:38.479
The beer distributor, he says there's
some problem with next month's order.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.917
Well, let him talk to Woody.
Woody handled it last month.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.758
I think that's the problem.

12:44.760 --> 12:47.320
Damn. All right, listen.

12:47.480 --> 12:49.277
We'll go up to Melville's
for your cheesecake,

12:49.440 --> 12:51.590
but then we're going to my place
for your beefcake.

12:52.240 --> 12:54.549
You've got some work to do,
don't you?

12:56.600 --> 12:58.795
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

12:58.960 --> 13:01.076
- Norman.
- What's your pleasure, Mr Peterson?

13:01.280 --> 13:05.193
Boxer shorts and loose shoes,
but I'll settle for a beer.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.550
So how was the Hungry Heifer?

13:08.720 --> 13:11.553
- It wasn't too good.
- No? Well, what'd you have?

13:12.080 --> 13:14.310
Well, I got the chef's special ribs.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.876
- That sounds pretty good.
- That's what I thought,

13:17.040 --> 13:20.555
but the chef just came out
and made fun of my tie.

13:22.720 --> 13:26.793
- So Cliffie and his dad not back yet?
- Oh, no, they had very big plans.

13:26.960 --> 13:29.474
Mr Clavin wanted to spend
the evening getting to know his son.

13:29.680 --> 13:32.558
Yeah, and the rest of his life
trying to forget.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.474
Woody, next time you order
beer from the distributor,

13:35.640 --> 13:38.632
try to be a little more
specific than "lots."

13:39.800 --> 13:41.074
- Sorry, Sam.
- That's all right.

13:41.280 --> 13:44.317
I called Melville's. They have
just two pieces of cheesecake left.

13:44.480 --> 13:47.358
No more. No less. No Diane.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.829
Boy, next to Sammy's life,
my life sure looks dull, doesn't it?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.753
Next to a barnacle
my life seems dull.

13:55.520 --> 13:58.637
Say, you know, that cheesecake
can be pretty fattening.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.836
You got any ideas
how we could work it off?

14:02.120 --> 14:04.509
- May I say something to you, Sam?
- Please.

14:04.880 --> 14:07.235
You know, the first few times
that we went out,

14:07.400 --> 14:10.995
I thought you were
coming on a little strong.

14:11.160 --> 14:14.470
I now miss those gentler times.

14:14.680 --> 14:16.193
Claudia, trust me.

14:16.360 --> 14:19.989
You're about to come upon the
gentlest time that you've ever known.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.798
Good Lord, Sam.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.470
What? That was good.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.237
I'm afraid we're just not
what each other's looking for.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.118
All right, maybe you're right.

14:30.280 --> 14:34.478
Oh, wait, listen, here.
I wanna wish you a happy life.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.551
As happy as you can be without me.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.231
There are no hard feelings here,
are there?

14:40.440 --> 14:43.637
No, no, on the contrary.
I'm glad that this happened.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.756
Because I feel that everything,

14:45.920 --> 14:49.390
no matter how degrading
and humiliating,

14:49.560 --> 14:52.438
should be experienced
at least once in life.

14:53.800 --> 14:57.270
Well, wait a second, here, Claudia.
Let's talk about this.

14:57.440 --> 14:59.078
Claudia.

15:01.080 --> 15:05.198
Claudia left rather abruptly.
She didn't even say goodbye.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.157
Was she upset about something?

15:07.320 --> 15:09.117
Yeah, she was upset
about something.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.999
Your little plan worked perfectly.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.436
What are you talking about?

15:14.600 --> 15:16.670
I can't believe you're
actually making me say this.

15:17.320 --> 15:19.117
- What?
- Why don't you just admit

15:19.280 --> 15:22.716
you're nuts about me and you can't
stand me going out with other women

15:22.880 --> 15:25.348
so you try to eliminate
the competition.

15:26.880 --> 15:33.069
Sam, your hormones have staged
a coup d'état on your brain.

15:34.280 --> 15:37.829
No, no, no. Don't try to
distract me with hormone talk.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.514
Well, as long as we're talking
about transparent plans,

15:40.720 --> 15:43.917
why don't you just admit that you
brought that clone of me here

15:44.080 --> 15:45.957
because you are still
hung up on me.

15:46.120 --> 15:50.910
Are you kidding me? There is only
one reason why you came back here.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.469
Because you asked me.

15:53.680 --> 15:56.717
I asked you, you begged to come back.
We're splitting hairs here.

15:56.880 --> 15:59.678
Sam, Melville's want to know
if you still want that cheesecake.

15:59.880 --> 16:02.030
Yes, I want that cheesecake.
Tell them I'll be right up.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.760
I'm gonna go up and have
that cheesecake all by myself.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.717
It'll be the best company
I've had all evening.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.313
Indeed.

16:09.480 --> 16:13.837
Unless you wanna come along and
make the evening a complete disaster.

16:14.480 --> 16:17.790
I wouldn't have cheesecake with you
if you were the last man on Earth

16:17.960 --> 16:21.509
and it was the last morsel of food.

16:27.440 --> 16:30.591
I'm getting kind of used
to eating by myself anyway.

16:39.360 --> 16:42.113
Well, it is delicious cheesecake.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.997
Does your offer include coffee?

16:47.320 --> 16:48.594
Maybe.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.638
- And a refill?
- Don't push it.

16:56.320 --> 16:57.833
Sam...

16:58.920 --> 17:01.957
...I am sorry that you
had to eat alone.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.838
That's okay.

17:04.160 --> 17:06.355
What did you guys
talk about anyway?

17:06.520 --> 17:09.159
Well, we talked about
the postmodernists

17:09.319 --> 17:12.710
and the trend away from
minimalism in literature.

17:12.880 --> 17:16.349
All of a sudden, my table
doesn't seem so bad after all.

17:18.319 --> 17:21.073
And he says, "Yeah, my sister."

17:21.280 --> 17:22.679
His sister!

17:24.160 --> 17:25.991
Time for a little
in-flight refuelling here.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.070
Oh, good.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.748
Now you're good
for another 1,000 miles.

17:33.520 --> 17:36.398
You two look like you've been having
a heck of a time. What did you do?

17:36.600 --> 17:38.556
- lt'd be better to ask what we didn't do.
- Yeah.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.676
How about if we just
withdrew the question.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.440
We caught the first quarter
of the Celtics game,

17:43.640 --> 17:46.950
went down to the petting zoo. It was
night, but we peeked over the fence.

17:47.120 --> 17:50.749
Then we went fishing and Dad took me
to the all-night barber's to get a haircut.

17:50.920 --> 17:53.798
Yeah, next time
he's gonna get them all cut.

17:56.360 --> 18:00.239
Then later, we had a father-and-son
talk about the birds and bees.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.595
Yeah, well, I already knew
about that stuff.

18:02.760 --> 18:05.069
There was one thing
that was a little bit shocking.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.875
Excuse me, Daddy.
I gotta make a pit stop.

18:09.040 --> 18:12.555
Yeah, yeah, go right ahead.
I'll refuel a little myself.

18:14.520 --> 18:17.432
Tell me about Cliffie. You guys
know him a lot better than I do.

18:17.600 --> 18:20.239
- Is he really as nice as he seems?
- Oh, you bet.

18:20.440 --> 18:23.193
And smart too. One of the
smartest guys I've ever met.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.870
And dependable. You call Cliff
at 4::00 in the morning, he's there.

18:27.080 --> 18:28.957
Where the hell else would he be?

18:30.640 --> 18:33.677
Hey, Mr Clavin, do you have
the gift of gab like your son?

18:33.880 --> 18:37.270
No, it comes from his mother's side.
She's the real yapper in the family.

18:37.440 --> 18:40.830
My God, she gets rolling,
she's like a hyena on bennies.

18:41.760 --> 18:43.478
Hey, Dad, come on.
Time's a-wasting.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.200
What do you say we go out
and get a set of matching tattoos?

18:46.400 --> 18:48.595
Cliffie, I gotta get cracking.
I got a plane to catch.

18:48.760 --> 18:52.196
Come on, Dad. So much time,
you know, we haven't talked.

18:52.360 --> 18:54.874
- We don't know about each other.
- Cliffie.

18:55.080 --> 18:57.799
- I just had a terrific idea.
- Oh, yeah? What's that, Dad?

18:57.960 --> 19:00.474
Why don't you
come to Australia with me.

19:00.640 --> 19:04.918
Australia? I don't know if I can
leave all this. My friends, my job.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.071
You can make new friends,
and you don't need a job.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.433
- What?
- I got a lot of dough stashed away.

19:10.880 --> 19:14.395
- Well, I need time to think about it.
- There's no time. I got to go now.

19:14.600 --> 19:15.999
What's the rush?

19:16.200 --> 19:18.509
I have got to get out of
this country as fast as I can.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.834
- What's going on?
- Okay, listen. I'll level with you.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.592
You're my son. I can trust you.

19:23.800 --> 19:26.872
My business has gotten me
in a little trouble with the law.

19:27.640 --> 19:31.076
- What kind of business is that?
- Real estate fraud.

19:33.760 --> 19:37.673
- Dad, that's illegal.
- Good, I'm not going too fast for you.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.032
Listen, come on,
you gonna come with me?

19:40.720 --> 19:43.029
No, no, look, Dad,
I can't let you do this.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.998
How about you give the money back,
throw yourself at the court's mercy.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.832
They'll let you off with 1 0 years max.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.231
Ten years. Come on, grow up, will you.
We're talking about heavy cake here.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.755
Now, I want you to come.
Are you gonna come or no?

19:55.120 --> 19:57.350
Well, how do you know
I'm not gonna turn you in?

19:57.520 --> 20:00.830
Cliffie, you're not gonna
turn in your own father.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.070
I know that and you know that.

20:04.200 --> 20:05.952
Yeah, you're right, Dad.

20:06.280 --> 20:10.512
I had a couple beers. I'm gonna make
one more stop and then I'm gone.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.158
Give me the phone.

20:19.320 --> 20:20.833
What's wrong?

20:21.840 --> 20:25.515
My old man's a crook. He's leaving
the country one step ahead of the law.

20:25.840 --> 20:27.592
You're not gonna
rat on your old man!

20:27.760 --> 20:29.034
Think about this, will you.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.952
Got nothing to think about now.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.952
Information?

20:33.360 --> 20:35.749
Yeah, give me the federal authorities.

20:37.280 --> 20:40.955
I don't know. Somebody
in charge of rotten daddies.

20:43.240 --> 20:45.151
I can't do it.

20:45.520 --> 20:47.431
I've aided a fugitive from justice.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.397
I'm a disgrace to my uniform.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.994
Hey, come on. Come off it, Clavin.

20:52.160 --> 20:54.799
You didn't disgrace anything.

20:54.960 --> 20:58.430
You can't turn the old guy in
because you love him.

20:58.600 --> 21:01.273
Now, anyone would understand that.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.437
Thank you, Carla.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.399
You're right.

21:07.560 --> 21:09.232
I do love him.

21:09.640 --> 21:12.108
Matter of fact, I think I'll go
give him a big hug right now.

21:12.880 --> 21:16.190
It might be a little uncool to hug him
in the men's room, you know?

21:18.520 --> 21:20.476
I guess you're right, Norm.

21:20.800 --> 21:24.759
What the heck. I can't wait. It's
the longest we've been apart all day.

21:25.520 --> 21:27.431
Carla, you know, for a minute there,

21:27.600 --> 21:30.114
you treated Cliff
as if he was a human being.

21:32.440 --> 21:36.194
What you are experiencing
is a half-melvin.

21:37.520 --> 21:41.798
You breathe one word of this and
I am going to give you a full-melvin.

21:41.960 --> 21:43.791
I think we understand each other.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.718
He's gone.

21:56.520 --> 21:58.556
This is all that's left.

21:59.160 --> 22:01.310
What do you suppose
happened to him?

22:01.960 --> 22:03.996
It's obvious, isn't it?

22:04.400 --> 22:06.197
My father didn't trust me,

22:06.360 --> 22:08.954
so he gave me the slip
out of the bathroom window.

22:13.960 --> 22:17.919
Guess I'll just go home.

22:23.200 --> 22:26.272
You're ruling out
the other possibility.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.159
What other possibility?

22:30.320 --> 22:32.515
Well, it's a little-known fact,

22:32.680 --> 22:37.993
but more and more people have been
going into men's rooms and vaporizing.

22:39.080 --> 22:41.355
I mean, just disappearing
into thin air.

22:41.520 --> 22:42.953
It's an unexplained phenomenon.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.475
- It's kind of like the Bermuda Triangle.
- That's right.

22:46.600 --> 22:49.068
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Get serious, will you.

22:50.320 --> 22:52.038
Have it your way.

22:55.800 --> 22:58.314
Well, you know, however,

22:58.480 --> 23:00.232
this much is true, you know.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.436
There's been recent sightings
of human beings

23:02.600 --> 23:05.512
being shot up into the underbelly
of alien spacecraft.

23:07.680 --> 23:09.796
You know, and speaking
of the Bermuda Triangle,

23:09.960 --> 23:12.110
- it's not technically a triangle.
- It's not?

23:12.280 --> 23:14.032
Heck, no!

23:14.200 --> 23:16.668
It's a trapezedo-rhomboid.

23:16.880 --> 23:19.838
They're perfect for attracting
Martian spacecraft.
