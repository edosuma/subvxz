WEBVTT

00:32.432 --> 00:34.000
WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:34.067 --> 00:35.402
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:35.468 --> 00:36.603
I'M JOHN OLIVER, THANKS SO MUCH

00:36.669 --> 00:38.138
FOR JOINING US.

00:38.204 --> 00:39.773
WE'RE BACK, AND WE'VE MISSED A

00:39.839 --> 00:40.740
LOT, FROM STEVE BANNON BEING

00:40.807 --> 00:42.175
CHARGED WITH MONEY-LAUNDERING,

00:42.242 --> 00:43.276
TO PAKISTAN SUFFERING MASSIVE

00:43.343 --> 00:45.245
FLOODING, TO THE PRESIDENT OF

00:45.311 --> 00:46.312
CHILE, SPEAKING ON THE DAY HIS

00:46.379 --> 00:47.514
COUNTRY REJECTED A NEW

00:47.580 --> 00:49.349
CONSTITUTION, WHILE BEING

00:49.416 --> 00:49.916
UNDERMINED BY AN UNEXPECTED

00:49.983 --> 00:50.884
GUEST.

00:50.950 --> 00:53.153
THE ROLE THAT I WILL PLAY AS

00:53.219 --> 00:54.287
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC IN OUR

00:54.354 --> 00:55.889
GOVERNMENT, AND WHICH WE ARE

00:55.955 --> 00:57.490
GOING TO COMMIT OURSELVES

00:57.557 --> 00:59.592
TOGETHER WITH ALL OF YOU IS TO

00:59.659 --> 01:01.227
DEFINE OURSELVES AS A COUNTRY,

01:01.294 --> 01:02.595
TO ADVANCE JUSTICE AND EQUALITY,

01:02.662 --> 01:04.130
AND TO ADVANCE GREATER

01:04.197 --> 01:04.998
DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH FOR ALL

01:05.064 --> 01:06.466
OF US.

01:06.533 --> 01:07.734
AND KNOW THAT THIS HISTORIC

01:07.801 --> 01:08.435
MOMENT WILL SURELY REMAIN IN OUR

01:08.501 --> 01:10.603
MEMORIES FOR A LONG TIME TO

01:10.670 --> 01:11.504
COME.

01:11.571 --> 01:14.140
THEY'RE WATCHING US FROM ALL

01:14.207 --> 01:16.309
OVER THE WORLD.

01:16.376 --> 01:16.709
OH, YEAH!

01:16.776 --> 01:17.143
THEY SURE ARE!

01:17.210 --> 01:20.947
JUST MAYBE NOT FOR THE EXACT

01:21.014 --> 01:21.781
REASONS YOU WERE HOPING FOR.

01:22.515 --> 01:23.049
IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO FOCUS ON

01:23.116 --> 01:24.150
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, TRY NOT TO

01:24.217 --> 01:25.985
SAY IT NEXT TO A BICYCLE-RIDING,

01:26.052 --> 01:26.920
FUN-SIZED SUPERMAN HAVING THE

01:26.986 --> 01:28.822
TIME OF HIS FUCKING LIFE.

01:28.888 --> 01:30.356
BUT WE OBVIOUSLY NEED TO START

01:30.423 --> 01:32.225
WITH THE UK, WHICH IS CLEARLY

01:32.292 --> 01:34.661
STILL REELING FROM THE SHOCKING

01:34.727 --> 01:36.162
DEATH OF A 96-YEAR-OLD WOMAN

01:36.229 --> 01:38.298
FROM NATURAL CAUSES.

01:38.364 --> 01:40.200
IT'S A BIG MOMENT, WHICH, FOR

01:40.266 --> 01:42.235
SOME REASON, ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE

01:42.302 --> 01:43.770
FELT THEY HAD TO WEIGH IN ON,

01:43.837 --> 01:48.608
FROM CRAZY FROG, WHICH TWEETED

01:48.675 --> 01:49.209
OUT "R.I.P. THE QUEEN, CANDLE

01:49.275 --> 01:49.709
EMOJI"-- A TWEET THAT'S

01:49.776 --> 01:52.412
IMPOSSIBLE TO READ WITHOUT

01:52.479 --> 01:53.947
MENTALLY ADDING-- TO DOMINO'S

01:54.013 --> 01:55.548
UK, WHICH POSTED "EVERYONE AT

01:55.615 --> 01:57.450
DOMINO'S JOINS THE NATION AND

01:57.517 --> 01:58.418
THE WORLD IN MOURNING THE DEATH

01:58.485 --> 02:00.153
OF QUEEN ELIZABETH II.

02:00.220 --> 02:01.421
OUR THOUGHTS AND CONDOLENCES ARE

02:01.488 --> 02:02.589
WITH THE ROYAL FAMILY."

02:02.655 --> 02:04.457
WHICH I GUESS IS NICE, ALTHOUGH

02:04.524 --> 02:06.626
IF "THE WORLD IS MOURNING," THEY

02:06.693 --> 02:08.361
SHOULD MAYBE TELL THE U.S.

02:08.428 --> 02:09.929
DOMINO'S ACCOUNT, WHOSE MOST

02:09.996 --> 02:11.464
RECENT TWEET, AS OF THIS TAPING,

02:11.531 --> 02:12.632
IS "IF UR READING THIS IT MEANS

02:12.699 --> 02:13.433
U NEED PIZZA.

02:13.500 --> 02:18.171
LIKE TO CONFIRM."

02:18.238 --> 02:20.673
GET YOUR FUCKING HOUSE IN ORDER,

02:20.740 --> 02:21.741
U.S. DOMINO'S, A LADY IS DEAD!

02:21.808 --> 02:23.576
BUT THE QUEEN'S DEATH IS NOT THE

02:23.643 --> 02:24.811
ONLY TRAUMATIC EVENT BRITAIN'S

02:24.878 --> 02:26.846
HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS WEEK.

02:26.913 --> 02:28.281
BECAUSE ON TUESDAY, LIZ TRUSS--

02:28.348 --> 02:29.282
BASICALLY, MARGARET THATCHER IF

02:29.349 --> 02:31.017
SHE WERE HIGH ON GLUE-- BECAME

02:31.084 --> 02:32.151
ITS NEW PRIME MINISTER.

02:32.218 --> 02:33.887
YOU MAY REMEMBER, A FEW WEEKS

02:33.953 --> 02:35.421
AGO, WHEN COVERING THE BATTLE TO

02:35.488 --> 02:35.955
REPLACE BORIS JOHNSON, WE

02:36.022 --> 02:37.490
INTRODUCED YOU TO HER MOST

02:39.492 --> 02:41.728
IN DECEMBER, I'LL BE IN

02:41.794 --> 02:42.428
BEIJING, OPENING UP NEW PORK

02:42.495 --> 02:48.234
MARKETS!

02:48.801 --> 02:49.502
EXCELLENT.

02:49.569 --> 02:50.370
I GENUINELY DON'T THINK SHE

02:50.436 --> 02:51.871
COULD HAVE GOTTEN A MORE TEPID

02:51.938 --> 02:53.106
RESPONSE TO "I'LL BE OPENING UP

02:53.172 --> 02:54.374
NEW PORK MARKETS" IF THAT

02:54.440 --> 02:55.508
AUDIENCE WAS LITERALLY FULL OF

02:55.575 --> 02:57.577
PIGS.

02:57.644 --> 02:59.112
AND IF YOU THINK SHE LEARNED

02:59.178 --> 02:59.879
ANYTHING AFTER THAT ABOUT THE

02:59.946 --> 03:01.047
DANGER OF HOLDING FOR APPLAUSE

03:01.114 --> 03:02.982
AFTER MAKING A LUDICROUS

03:03.049 --> 03:04.918
STATEMENT, JUST WATCH THE SPEECH

03:04.984 --> 03:06.519
SHE GAVE TO HER PARTY ON MONDAY,

03:06.586 --> 03:07.587
WHERE SHE TRIED TO PAY TRIBUTE

03:07.654 --> 03:10.256
TO HER PREDECESSOR.

03:10.323 --> 03:12.525
BORIS, YOU GOT BREXIT DONE.

03:12.592 --> 03:14.661
YOU CRUSHED JEREMY CORBYN.

03:14.727 --> 03:17.497
YOU ROLLED OUT THE VACCINE, AND

03:17.564 --> 03:21.334
YOU STOOD UP TO VLADIMIR PUTIN.

03:21.401 --> 03:22.468
YOU ARE ADMIRED FROM KIEV TO

03:22.535 --> 03:29.242
CARLISLE.

03:29.842 --> 03:30.310
OKAY, A COUPLE OF

03:30.376 --> 03:30.944
FIRST, THE UK GOES ABOVE

03:31.010 --> 03:32.245
CARLISLE.

03:32.312 --> 03:33.580
SO THAT'S BASICALLY AN ADMISSION

03:33.646 --> 03:34.547
THAT EVERYONE NORTH OF THIS

03:34.614 --> 03:38.451
POINT FUCKING HATES BORIS.

03:38.518 --> 03:39.786
AND SECOND, PRAISING BORIS

03:39.852 --> 03:40.386
JOHNSON ISN'T HOW YOU GET AN

03:40.453 --> 03:41.454
AUDIENCE TO LOVE YOU.

03:41.521 --> 03:42.989
AS WE ALL KNOW, THE WAY TO DO

03:43.056 --> 03:44.924
THAT IS TO HAVE A CHILEAN CHILD

03:44.991 --> 03:46.492
SUPERMAN RIDE AROUND YOU.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.661
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO DISTRACT

03:48.728 --> 03:50.530
PEOPLE FROM THE STUPIDITY OF

03:50.597 --> 03:51.898
WHAT YOU JUST SAID.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.333
LIZ TRUSS IS NOW FACING A

03:53.399 --> 03:55.068
MULTITUDE OF PROBLEMS, WITH THE

03:55.134 --> 03:55.868
MOST PRESSING BEING THE FACT

03:55.935 --> 03:56.936
THAT-- DUE TO FACTORS LIKE

03:57.003 --> 03:58.605
COVID AND RUSSIA'S WAR IN

03:58.671 --> 03:59.205
UKRAINE-- BRITISH HOUSEHOLDS

03:59.272 --> 04:01.074
FACE AN EIGHTY PERCENT INCREASE

04:01.140 --> 04:02.241
ON THEIR ENERGY BILLS STARTING

04:02.308 --> 04:03.776
NEXT MONTH.

04:03.843 --> 04:05.445
WHICH IS CLEARLY TERRIFYING--

04:05.511 --> 04:06.913
AND SOMEHOW MADE EVEN GRIMMER BY

04:06.980 --> 04:08.147
HOW ONE DAYTIME SHOW TRIED TO

04:10.416 --> 04:11.317
HOW ARE YOUR ENERGY BILLS?

04:11.384 --> 04:11.918
ARE YOU A BIT WORRIED ABOUT IT

04:11.985 --> 04:13.486
ALL?

04:13.553 --> 04:16.589
MAJOR.

04:16.656 --> 04:17.223
I'VE GOT ONE OF THESE PREPAYMENT

04:17.290 --> 04:18.057
METERS AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY

04:18.124 --> 04:24.530
MURDER.

04:24.597 --> 04:24.897
OH GOD...

04:24.964 --> 04:25.732
WELL, LET'S HOPE IT LANDS ON

04:25.798 --> 04:26.132
ONE OF THOSE THEN.

04:26.199 --> 04:26.766
WHATEVER, YOU'RE GOING TO WIN

04:26.833 --> 04:27.433
SOME MONEY, SO DON'T WORRY, HERE

04:27.500 --> 04:27.634
WE GO.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.069
1000 POUNDS OR ENERGY BILLS,

04:30.136 --> 04:30.637
1000 POUNDS OR ENERGY BILLS.

04:30.703 --> 04:37.176
IT IS GOING TO BE...

04:37.243 --> 04:39.145
IT'S YOUR ENERGY BILL!

04:39.212 --> 04:39.812
OH MY GOD.

04:39.879 --> 04:41.447
THANK YOU!

04:41.514 --> 04:43.016
WE ARE PAYING YOUR ENERGY

04:43.082 --> 04:44.717
BILL FOR FOUR MONTHS.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.753
OH FANTASTIC!

04:46.819 --> 04:47.620
NO WORRIES.

04:47.687 --> 04:51.024
WOW, THAT'S BLEAK.

04:51.090 --> 04:52.558
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO AREN'T

04:52.625 --> 04:53.660
FAMILIAR WITH BRITISH TV, THAT'S

04:53.726 --> 04:55.795
FROM A PROGRAM CALLED "ORWELLIAN

04:55.862 --> 04:56.329
NIGHTMARE DOOM SPIRAL THIS

04:56.396 --> 04:57.897
MORNING."

04:57.964 --> 04:58.765
TRUSS HAS NOW PROPOSED LIMITING

04:58.831 --> 05:00.299
ENERGY PRICES, WHICH COULD

05:00.366 --> 05:01.267
REPORTEDLY COST THE GOVERNMENT

05:01.334 --> 05:02.368
MORE THAN A HUNDRED BILLION

05:02.435 --> 05:04.103
POUNDS.

05:04.170 --> 05:05.071
AND MANY HAVE SUGGESTED THAT,

05:05.138 --> 05:07.473
RATHER THAN PASSING THAT COST

05:07.540 --> 05:08.074
ALONG TO TAXPAYERS, SOME OF IT

05:08.141 --> 05:09.809
SHOULD BE RECOUPED THROUGH A NEW

05:09.876 --> 05:10.576
SO-CALLED "WINDFALL TAX" ON OIL

05:10.643 --> 05:12.045
AND GAS COMPANIES, WHO HAVE MADE

05:12.111 --> 05:13.246
HUGE PROFITS DURING THE PRICE

05:13.312 --> 05:13.780
SPIKE FOR DOING ABSOLUTELY

05:13.846 --> 05:14.514
NOTHING.

05:14.580 --> 05:15.982
BUT TRUSS HAS NO INTEREST IN

05:16.049 --> 05:17.517
DOING THAT.

05:17.583 --> 05:18.751
ONE THING I ABSOLUTELY DON'T

05:18.818 --> 05:23.956
SUPPORT IS A WINDFALL TAX.

05:24.023 --> 05:24.490
I THINK IT'S A LABOR IDEA.

05:24.557 --> 05:25.124
IT'S ALL ABOUT BASHING BUSINESS,

05:25.191 --> 05:26.859
AND IT SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE

05:26.926 --> 05:27.593
TO INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS AND

05:27.660 --> 05:29.195
TO THE PUBLIC.

05:29.262 --> 05:30.630
I DON'T THINK PROFIT IS A DIRTY

05:30.697 --> 05:32.999
WORD AND THE FACT IT'S BECOME A

05:33.066 --> 05:34.634
DIRTY WORD IN OUR SOCIETY IS A

05:34.701 --> 05:36.335
MASSIVE PROBLEM BECAUSE THERE

05:36.402 --> 05:38.838
ARE, YOU KNOW, IN THIS AUDIENCE

05:38.905 --> 05:39.739
TODAY WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE

05:39.806 --> 05:42.408
WHO RUN BUSINESSES AND MAKE A

05:42.475 --> 05:43.076
PROFIT AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD

05:43.142 --> 05:43.276
THING.

05:43.342 --> 05:44.777
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

05:44.844 --> 05:46.012
ABOUT?

05:46.079 --> 05:47.914
I'M JUST GOING TO SAY IT-- AND

05:47.980 --> 05:48.781
YOU MAY NOT LIKE IT, BUT IT

05:48.848 --> 05:49.682
DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY LESS TRUE:

05:49.749 --> 05:51.217
THE NICEST THING THE QUEEN OF

05:51.284 --> 05:53.286
ENGLAND EVER DID FOR ANYONE WAS

05:53.352 --> 05:54.153
DIE THE WEEK THAT WOMAN BECAME

05:54.220 --> 05:55.388
PRIME MINISTER.

05:55.455 --> 05:56.789
BECAUSE FOR AT LEAST A WEEK,

05:56.856 --> 05:58.524
SHE'S NOT GOING TO BE GETTING

05:58.591 --> 06:00.093
JUSTIFIABLY DESTROYED FOR

06:00.159 --> 06:02.061
ANSWERS LIKE THAT.

06:02.128 --> 06:03.096
LOOK, THINGS ARE PRETTY BLEAK IN

06:03.162 --> 06:05.498
THE UK RIGHT NOW.

06:05.565 --> 06:07.500
THIS GUY'S ABOUT TO BE ON ALL

06:07.567 --> 06:09.502
THE MONEY, AND MORNING TV IS NOW

06:09.569 --> 06:10.903
BASICALLY THE HUNGER GAMES, BUT

06:10.970 --> 06:11.971
DON'T WORRY, BRITAIN-- YOUR

06:12.038 --> 06:13.506
FUTURE IS NOW SECURELY IN THE

06:13.573 --> 06:14.507
HANDS OF DOLLAR STORE BRITISH

06:14.574 --> 06:17.276
LESLIE KNOPE.

06:17.343 --> 06:17.910
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE FINE.

06:17.977 --> 06:22.982
"AND NOW THIS."

06:23.049 --> 06:23.950
AND NOW, SEAN

06:24.016 --> 06:26.285
HANNITY DOES THE OPPOSITE FOR AN

06:26.352 --> 06:28.721
AD FOR WALMART.

07:38.191 --> 07:38.724
MOVING ON.

07:38.791 --> 07:39.292
FOR OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT,

07:39.358 --> 07:39.892
WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING A

07:39.959 --> 07:40.793
LITTLE DIFFERENT, AND TALK ABOUT

07:40.860 --> 07:41.828
ANOTHER TV SHOW.

07:41.894 --> 07:43.563
SPECIFICALLY, "LAW & ORDER," THE

07:43.629 --> 07:44.831
WILDLY POPULAR FRANCHISE THAT'S

07:44.897 --> 07:46.265
BEEN ON TV FOR DECADES, TREATING

07:46.332 --> 07:47.466
US TO INCREDIBLE DIALOGUE LIKE

07:49.368 --> 07:50.736
DO YOU THINK THAT THERE WAS A

07:50.803 --> 07:51.737
REASON THAT THE KILLER SODOMIZED

07:51.804 --> 07:53.673
YOUR HUSBAND WITH A BANANA?

07:53.739 --> 07:56.342
NOW "THAT" IS ACTING.

07:56.409 --> 07:57.877
EVEN IF I WASN'T LISTENING TO

07:57.944 --> 07:58.511
THE WORDS COMING OUT OF MARISKA

07:58.578 --> 07:59.478
HARGITAY'S MOUTH, I'D KNOW,

07:59.545 --> 08:01.147
BASED ON HER DELIVERY ALONE,

08:01.214 --> 08:02.315
THAT THE KILLER HAD SODOMIZED

08:02.381 --> 08:03.149
THIS PERSON'S HUSBAND WITH A

08:03.216 --> 08:09.822
BANANA, AND THAT SHE WAS TRYING

08:09.889 --> 08:10.323
TO FIGURE OUT WHY.

08:10.389 --> 08:10.957
NOW, IT TURNS OUT, THE VICTIM'S

08:11.023 --> 08:11.524
WIFE ACTUALLY ANSWERED THAT

08:11.591 --> 08:11.791
QUESTION.

08:11.858 --> 08:12.358
AND THINK OF THE FUNNIEST

08:12.425 --> 08:12.859
POSSIBLE RESPONSE.

08:12.925 --> 08:13.926
YOU'RE WRONG, IT'S THIS.

08:13.993 --> 08:14.694
DO YOU THINK THAT THERE WAS A

08:14.760 --> 08:16.262
REASON THAT THE KILLER SODOMIZED

08:16.329 --> 08:19.665
YOUR HUSBAND WITH A BANANA?

08:19.732 --> 08:21.968
HE WAS ALLERGIC TO BANANAS.

08:22.034 --> 08:24.270
EXCELLENT.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.172
I LOVE THE IDEA OF A KILLER

08:26.239 --> 08:27.874
ASKING, "BEFORE I MURDER AND

08:27.940 --> 08:29.308
SODOMIZE YOU, I'VE GOT JUST ONE

08:29.375 --> 08:31.344
DO YOU HAVE ANY

08:31.410 --> 08:33.179
ALLERGIES I SHOULD BE AWARE OF?"

08:33.246 --> 08:34.413
THAT EXCHANGE IS JUST ONE OF THE

08:34.480 --> 08:36.082
REASONS WHY "LAW & ORDER" IS THE

08:36.148 --> 08:37.283
KING OF COP SHOWS.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.384
BETWEEN ALL ITS VARIOUS

08:38.451 --> 08:39.552
SPINOFFS, THERE ARE OVER 1,200

08:39.619 --> 08:41.487
EPISODES OF IT.

08:41.554 --> 08:42.154
IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR SO LONG,

08:42.221 --> 08:43.022
IT'S GENUINELY HARD TO THINK OF

08:43.089 --> 08:45.558
AN ACTOR WHO HASN'T APPEARED ON

08:45.625 --> 08:46.192
IT AT SOME POINT, BECAUSE IT'S

08:46.259 --> 08:46.893
FEATURED EVERYONE FROM

08:46.959 --> 08:48.594
CHEVY CHASE, TO

08:48.661 --> 08:50.162
SAMUEL L. JACKSON, TO

08:50.229 --> 08:52.431
PHILIP SEYMOUR HOFFMAN, TO

08:52.498 --> 08:54.700
ANGELA LANSBURY APPEARING WITH

08:54.767 --> 08:55.835
HER LAWYER, BRADLEY COOPER, TO

08:55.902 --> 08:56.969
ADAM DRIVER, WHO'S ON SEASON 13

08:57.036 --> 08:58.437
EPISODE 11 OF SVU, FOR

08:58.504 --> 09:00.506
APPROXIMATELY THREE MINUTES AND

09:00.573 --> 09:01.641
32 SECONDS OF SCREENTIME.

09:01.707 --> 09:02.308
IF YOU'RE THE KIND OF PERSON WHO

09:02.375 --> 09:04.810
COUNTS THAT SORT OF THING.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.112
EVEN POLITICIANS HAVE BEEN ON

09:06.178 --> 09:07.747
IT, LIKE RUDY GIULIANI,

09:07.813 --> 09:09.248
MIKE BLOOMBERG, AND JOE BIDEN,

09:09.315 --> 09:10.983
ALL OF WHOM GUEST-STARRED AS

09:11.050 --> 09:13.286
THEMSELVES.

09:13.352 --> 09:13.986
WHICH IS A LITTLE WEIRD.

09:14.053 --> 09:14.954
ALTHOUGH IT'D CLEARLY BE WEIRDER

09:15.021 --> 09:16.489
IF BIDEN APPEARED AS SOMEONE

09:16.555 --> 09:17.390
ELSE, LIKE A TIMES SQUARE

09:17.456 --> 09:19.358
NINJA TURTLE WHO STUMBLED ACROSS

09:19.425 --> 09:22.862
A GRISLY MURDER VICTIM SUFFERING

09:22.929 --> 09:23.963
FROM BANANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK.

09:24.030 --> 09:24.997
"LAW & ORDER" IS ON ALL THE

09:25.064 --> 09:27.033
TIME, AND FOR MANY, IT'S COMFORT

09:27.099 --> 09:27.833
TV.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.569
BUT IT, AND SHOWS LIKE IT, HAVE

09:30.636 --> 09:32.004
A REAL IMPACT-- ONE STUDY FOUND

09:32.071 --> 09:33.172
"VIEWERS OF CRIME DRAMAS ARE

09:33.239 --> 09:34.340
MORE LIKELY TO BELIEVE THE

09:34.407 --> 09:35.975
POLICE ARE SUCCESSFUL AT

09:36.042 --> 09:37.310
LOWERING CRIME, USE FORCE ONLY

09:37.376 --> 09:38.711
WHEN NECESSARY, AND THAT

09:38.778 --> 09:40.146
MISCONDUCT DOES NOT TYPICALLY

09:40.212 --> 09:42.181
LEAD TO FALSE CONFESSIONS."

09:42.248 --> 09:43.482
WHICH WOULD BE GREAT IF IT WERE

09:43.549 --> 09:44.750
TRUE, BUT IF YOU'RE WATCHING

09:44.817 --> 09:45.751
THIS SHOW, YOU PROBABLY KNOW...

09:45.818 --> 09:47.820
IT ISN'T.

09:47.887 --> 09:48.955
AND "LAW & ORDER" IN PARTICULAR

09:49.021 --> 09:50.022
HAS BECOME AN AMERICAN

09:50.089 --> 09:51.490
INSTITUTION, WITH HUGE CULTURAL

09:51.557 --> 09:53.059
INFLUENCE.

09:53.125 --> 09:54.393
SOME HAVE ARGUED ITS FORMULA

09:54.460 --> 09:55.194
SHAPED A GENERATION'S

09:55.261 --> 09:55.761
UNDERSTANDING OF THE LEGAL

09:55.828 --> 09:57.430
SYSTEM.

09:57.496 --> 09:59.332
AND YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN PEOPLE

09:59.398 --> 10:00.166
USING IT AS A GO-TO REFERENCE

10:00.232 --> 10:01.300
POINT, LIKE THIS:

10:01.367 --> 10:03.836
I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY, I WATCH

10:03.903 --> 10:04.904
"LAW & ORDER" FROM TIME TO TIME.

10:04.971 --> 10:07.606
MY LEGAL EXPERIENCE IS

10:07.673 --> 10:10.443
WATCHING "LAW & ORDER" AND "LAW

10:10.509 --> 10:10.776
& ORDER: SVU."

10:10.843 --> 10:11.444
I THINK THE AVERAGE VIEWER OF

10:11.510 --> 10:12.011
"LAW & ORDER" PROBABLY KNOWS

10:12.078 --> 10:12.645
THAT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO

10:12.712 --> 10:12.845
THIS.

10:12.912 --> 10:13.813
WELL, I WENT TO A GREAT LAW

10:13.879 --> 10:14.547
SCHOOL, BUT MOST OF WHAT I DO ON

10:14.613 --> 10:16.282
A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS IS BASED OFF

10:16.349 --> 10:19.752
OF WHAT I LEARNED ON "LAW &

10:19.819 --> 10:20.419
ORDER."

10:20.486 --> 10:21.020
LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING

10:21.087 --> 10:21.620
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN LEARN

10:21.687 --> 10:22.088
FROM "LAW & ORDER."

10:22.154 --> 10:23.622
I'VE LEARNED A TON FROM ICE-T'S

10:23.689 --> 10:25.491
TWITTER FEED ALONE, WHERE HE

10:25.558 --> 10:26.492
DROPS TRUTH BOMBS LIKE "A REAL

10:26.559 --> 10:27.660
NUT...

10:27.727 --> 10:29.061
FEELS LIKE EVERY BONE IN YOUR

10:29.128 --> 10:29.695
BODY COMES OUT THE HEAD OF YOUR

10:29.762 --> 10:30.062
DICK...

10:30.129 --> 10:30.730
SAY NO MORE.

10:30.796 --> 10:31.564
I'M DONE.

10:31.630 --> 10:34.000
FALL ASLEEP IN 2 MINUTES."

10:34.066 --> 10:35.768
LOOK, THE MAN IS A TRUTH TELLER.

10:35.835 --> 10:36.702
IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE ICE,

10:36.769 --> 10:39.105
STAY OUT OF THE FREEZER.

10:39.171 --> 10:41.374
IT CAN BE GENUINELY ALARMING HOW

10:41.440 --> 10:42.975
SERIOUSLY SOME PEOPLE TAKE THE

10:43.042 --> 10:44.577
SHOW-- IN FACT, JUST LISTEN TO

10:44.643 --> 10:45.344
WARREN LEIGHT, "LAW & ORDER:

10:45.411 --> 10:47.213
SVU"'S FORMER LONGTIME

10:47.279 --> 10:48.280
SHOWRUNNER, TALK ABOUT AN

10:48.347 --> 10:49.682
UNEXPECTED GROUP OF VIEWERS HE

10:49.749 --> 10:50.783
LEARNED ABOUT.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.018
WE'VE ALSO FOUND OUT OVER

10:52.084 --> 10:54.420
TIME, AND THIS IS A LITTLE

10:54.487 --> 10:56.922
ANXIETY-PROVOKING FOR ME, THAT A

10:56.989 --> 11:04.330
LOT OF COPS AREN'T TRAINED IN

11:04.397 --> 11:04.997
HOW TO-- HOW TO DO THEIR JOB IN

11:05.064 --> 11:05.631
CERTAIN CASES OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.

11:05.698 --> 11:06.232
AND A LOT OF COPS GET A LOT OF

11:06.298 --> 11:07.666
THEIR INFORMATION FROM WATCHING

11:07.733 --> 11:08.267
"SVU", WHICH, A LOT OF POLICE

11:08.334 --> 11:09.168
DEPARTMENTS DON'T HAVE THE TIME

11:09.235 --> 11:10.970
OR THE MONEY TO-TO PUT PEOPLE

11:11.037 --> 11:19.645
THROUGH FORMAL TRAINING.

11:19.712 --> 11:20.212
THAT'S NOT GREAT!

11:20.279 --> 11:20.846
NOBODY SHOULD BE LEARNING HOW TO

11:20.913 --> 11:21.447
DO THEIR JOB FROM A TV SHOW.

11:21.514 --> 11:22.014
UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOUR JOB

11:22.081 --> 11:22.648
HAPPENS TO BE "TELLING JOKES TO

11:22.715 --> 11:23.249
MASK YOUR DEEP-SEATED FEELINGS

11:23.315 --> 11:23.816
OF EMPTINESS AND EXISTENTIAL

11:23.883 --> 11:24.383
DREAD," IN WHICH CASE: KEEP

11:24.450 --> 11:24.650
WATCHING!

11:24.717 --> 11:26.318
YOU MIGHT PICK UP SOME TIPS!

11:26.385 --> 11:28.587
SO IF "LAW & ORDER" IS BEING

11:28.654 --> 11:29.922
CO-SIGNED BY ELECTED LEADERS,

11:29.989 --> 11:31.657
AND EVERYONE FROM TV PUNDITS TO

11:31.724 --> 11:33.025
ACTUAL COPS ARE USING IT TO

11:33.092 --> 11:34.593
LEARN ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT, WE

11:34.660 --> 11:35.928
THOUGHT TONIGHT, WE'D TAKE A

11:35.995 --> 11:37.463
LOOK AT WHAT THIS FRANCHISE HAS

11:37.530 --> 11:38.230
ACTUALLY BEEN TEACHING US.

11:38.297 --> 11:39.799
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

11:39.865 --> 11:41.133
THAT THE LINE BETWEEN COP SHOWS

11:41.200 --> 11:42.234
AND ACTUAL COPS HAS ALWAYS BEEN

11:42.301 --> 11:45.771
A LITTLE BLURRY.

11:45.838 --> 11:48.340
IN FACT THE FIRST HIT COP SHOW,

11:48.407 --> 11:50.342
"DRAGNET," WHICH DEBUTED ON TV

11:50.409 --> 11:51.677
IN 1951, MADE A BIG SELLING

11:51.744 --> 11:54.146
POINT OF ITS AUTHENTICITY, RIGHT

11:54.213 --> 11:56.082
FROM THE START OF EACH EPISODE.

11:56.148 --> 11:56.849
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE

11:56.916 --> 11:57.550
STORY YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE IS

11:57.616 --> 11:58.851
TRUE.

11:58.918 --> 11:59.552
THE NAMES HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO

11:59.618 --> 12:02.988
PROTECT THE INNOCENT.

12:04.657 --> 12:05.758
I GOTTA SAY, THE

12:05.825 --> 12:06.992
SURPRISING THING THERE IS THAT

12:07.059 --> 12:08.394
IT STARTS WITH "LADIES AND

12:08.461 --> 12:09.328
GENTLEMEN," AS THAT SOUNDS LIKE

12:09.395 --> 12:10.596
THE SORT OF VOICE THAT WOULD SAY

12:10.663 --> 12:11.897
"LETTING YOUR WIFE WATCH

12:11.964 --> 12:12.431
TELEVISION COULD GIVE HER

12:12.498 --> 12:14.567
NOTIONS."

12:14.633 --> 12:17.269
BUT THAT CLAIM OF VERISIMILITUDE

12:17.336 --> 12:19.205
CAME AT A PRICE-- DRAGNET'S

12:19.271 --> 12:20.172
STAR AND CREATOR, JACK WEBB,

12:20.239 --> 12:21.507
AGREED THAT SCRIPTS WOULD BE

12:21.574 --> 12:24.677
FORMALLY APPROVED BY THE LAPD'S

12:24.743 --> 12:25.744
PUBLIC INFORMATION DIVISION--

12:25.811 --> 12:26.645
AND IN RETURN, THE SHOW COULD

12:26.712 --> 12:28.681
SHOOT WHEREVER THEY WANTED, HAVE

12:28.747 --> 12:29.815
COPS FOR EXTRAS, AND USE POLICE

12:29.882 --> 12:30.950
VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT.

12:31.016 --> 12:32.618
WHICH WAS A PRETTY GOOD DEAL FOR

12:32.685 --> 12:34.920
BOTH SIDES-- THE SHOW GOT A

12:34.987 --> 12:37.056
PATINA OF AUTHENTICITY, AND THE

12:37.123 --> 12:39.258
LAPD GOT A FLATTERING PORTRAYAL,

12:39.325 --> 12:41.427
WHICH IT FRANKLY NEEDED, GIVEN

12:41.494 --> 12:41.961
THAT, RIGHT AFTER DRAGNET

12:42.027 --> 12:43.963
PREMIERED, APPROXIMATELY FIFTY

12:44.029 --> 12:45.231
LAPD OFFICERS BRUTALLY BEAT

12:45.297 --> 12:46.732
SEVEN MEN IN THEIR CUSTODY FOR

12:46.799 --> 12:47.466
OVER AN HOUR, LEAVING THEM

12:47.533 --> 12:49.068
HOSPITALIZED WITH BROKEN BONES

12:49.135 --> 12:50.136
AND RUPTURED ORGANS-- IN AN

12:50.202 --> 12:51.570
INCIDENT THAT LATER BECOME KNOWN

12:51.637 --> 12:52.838
AS "BLOODY CHRISTMAS."

12:52.905 --> 12:55.040
SO IF DRAGNET REALLY WANTED TO

12:55.107 --> 12:57.576
BE AUTHENTIC, EVERY EPISODE

12:57.643 --> 12:58.711
SHOULD'VE PROBABLY STARTED LIKE

12:58.978 --> 12:59.545
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.080
THE STORY YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE

13:01.147 --> 13:02.548
IS BULLSHIT.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.216
THE NAMES HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO

13:04.283 --> 13:05.618
PROTECT THE LAPD BECAUSE THEY

13:05.684 --> 13:06.852
HELPED SAVE US A BUNCH OF MONEY

13:06.919 --> 13:11.056
ON PROPS.

13:11.891 --> 13:14.193
DRAGNET HAD A BIG

13:14.260 --> 13:15.161
IMPACT ON VIEWERS AT THE TIME,

13:15.227 --> 13:16.996
INCLUDING ONE PARTICULAR LITTLE

13:17.062 --> 13:18.931
BOY, WHO LATER REMINISCED ABOUT

13:18.998 --> 13:19.965
BEING FIVE OR SIX YEARS OLD, AND

13:20.032 --> 13:21.100
ALLOWED TO STAY UP BECAUSE

13:21.167 --> 13:23.302
"DRAGNET" WAS ON.

13:23.369 --> 13:25.804
THAT BOY EVENTUALLY GREW UP TO

13:25.871 --> 13:27.940
BECOME SUCH A HOUSEHOLD NAME,

13:28.007 --> 13:28.741
SOMEONE ONCE DID THIS TO THEIR

13:30.109 --> 13:31.477
HERE IT IS, THE WORDS,

13:31.544 --> 13:34.780
"EXECUTIVE PRODUCER: DICK WOLF."

13:34.847 --> 13:35.414
LOOK AT-- LOOK AT--

13:35.481 --> 13:36.148
ON HIS LOWER BACK.

13:36.215 --> 13:37.116
YES, YEAH.

13:37.183 --> 13:38.017
THE MAN SAYS HE GOT IT

13:38.083 --> 13:38.651
BECAUSE HE'S OBSESSED WITH "LAW

13:38.717 --> 13:39.118
& ORDER."

13:39.185 --> 13:40.352
YEAH.

13:40.419 --> 13:42.621
A DICK WOLF TATTOO.

13:42.688 --> 13:43.556
THAT'S REAL STAR POWER,

13:43.622 --> 13:45.024
ESPECIALLY FOR AN EXECUTIVE

13:45.090 --> 13:45.658
PRODUCER.

13:45.724 --> 13:47.159
PERHAPS THAT'S WHY ICE-T HIMSELF

13:47.226 --> 13:49.795
ONCE SIMPLY TWEETED,

13:49.862 --> 13:50.963
"DICK WOLF," AND IT GOT

13:51.030 --> 13:52.865
108 LIKES.

13:52.932 --> 13:54.967
DICK WOLF IS ONE OF THOSE NAMES,

13:55.034 --> 13:55.935
LIKE "STEVE MADDEN" OR "CHARLES

13:56.001 --> 13:57.169
SCHWAB," THAT YOU SEE ALL THE

13:57.236 --> 13:59.605
TIME, EVEN IF YOU HAVE NO IDEA

13:59.672 --> 14:00.706
WHAT DICK WOLF HIMSELF ACTUALLY

14:00.773 --> 14:04.843
LOOKS LIKE.

14:04.910 --> 14:05.477
THAT'S NOT DICK

14:05.544 --> 14:06.278
WOLF, THAT'S CHARLES SCHWAB--

14:06.345 --> 14:07.746
THIS IS DICK WOLF.

14:07.813 --> 14:08.881
EXCEPT IT ISN'T, THAT'S STEVE

14:08.948 --> 14:10.249
MADDEN.

14:10.316 --> 14:11.917
THIS IS DICK WOLF.

14:11.984 --> 14:14.520
IS WHAT I WOULD SAY IF THAT WAS

14:14.587 --> 14:15.154
HIM, BUT IT'S JUST A STOCK IMAGE

14:15.221 --> 14:16.055
THAT CAME UP WHEN WE SEARCHED

14:16.121 --> 14:16.889
"BUSINESS GRANDPA."

14:16.956 --> 14:18.557
THIS, I PROMISE, IS THE REAL

14:18.624 --> 14:20.159
DICK WOLF.

14:20.226 --> 14:22.127
AND DICK WOLF WAS THE

14:22.194 --> 14:24.597
SIX-YEAR-OLD "DRAGNET" FAN WHO

14:24.663 --> 14:26.332
THEN GREW UP TO CREATE "LAW &

14:26.398 --> 14:27.032
ORDER."

14:27.099 --> 14:28.167
AND INTERESTINGLY, HE ACTUALLY

14:28.234 --> 14:29.635
STARTED OUT IN ADVERTISING,

14:29.702 --> 14:30.202
WHERE AMONG OTHER THINGS, HE

14:30.269 --> 14:33.038
HELPED CREATE THIS WILDLY SEXIST

14:33.105 --> 14:33.639
AD CAMPAIGN FOR NATIONAL

14:33.706 --> 14:35.341
AIRLINES.

14:35.407 --> 14:35.941
I'M JUDY, AND I WAS BORN TO

14:36.008 --> 14:38.444
FLY.

14:38.510 --> 14:41.313
FLY ME TO HOUSTON.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.716
NATIONAL HAS NONSTOP DC-10S

14:43.782 --> 14:44.883
EVERY DAY, OR FLY ME TO NEW

14:44.950 --> 14:46.218
ORLEANS ON THE ONLY DC-10S.

14:46.285 --> 14:47.653
YOU CAN FLY ME MORNING,

14:47.720 --> 14:48.988
AFTERNOON, OR NIGHT.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.956
JUST SAY WHEN.

14:51.023 --> 14:54.293
I'M JUDY, AND I WAS BORN TO FLY.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.227
FLY ME.

14:55.294 --> 14:55.961
FLY JUDY.

14:56.028 --> 14:57.963
FLY NATIONAL.

14:58.030 --> 15:00.199
HOLY SHIT.

15:00.266 --> 15:01.800
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE TARGET

15:01.867 --> 15:04.003
DEMO OF THAT WERE MEN AGED

15:04.069 --> 15:05.504
EIGHTEEN TO FORTY WHO LIVE BY

15:05.571 --> 15:06.972
THE MOTTO "CAN'T FUCK IT?

15:07.039 --> 15:07.806
DON'T WANT IT."

15:07.873 --> 15:10.643
THE WHOLE "FLY ME" CAMPAIGN WAS

15:10.709 --> 15:11.810
A BIG SUCCESS, AND DICK WOLF

15:11.877 --> 15:13.812
LATER BRAGGED ABOUT IT TO THE

15:13.879 --> 15:14.647
LEAST APPROPRIATE PERSON

15:14.713 --> 15:16.582
IMAGINABLE.

15:16.649 --> 15:17.483
YOU WERE IN ADVERTISING

15:17.549 --> 15:21.654
BEFORE AS A WRITER.

15:21.720 --> 15:22.454
AS A WRITER-PRODUCER, I

15:22.521 --> 15:22.855
MADE COMMERCIALS.

15:22.921 --> 15:23.756
YOU MADE COMMERCIALS. WHAT

15:23.822 --> 15:24.356
WERE SOME OF THE COMMERCIALS?

15:24.423 --> 15:24.923
WOULD PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THESE

15:24.990 --> 15:25.357
COMMERCIALS TODAY?

15:25.424 --> 15:26.158
OH, SURE.

15:26.225 --> 15:27.493
"I'M CHERYL-- FLY ME."

15:27.559 --> 15:29.128
"I'M CHERYL-- FLY ME."

15:29.194 --> 15:31.530
HEY, HEY, THAT'S-- TODAY,

15:31.597 --> 15:32.031
THAT'S IMMEDIATE SEXUAL

15:32.097 --> 15:32.564
DISCRIMEN-- IT'S SEXUAL

15:32.631 --> 15:33.165
HARASSMENT, IT'S IMMEDIATELY

15:33.232 --> 15:33.632
GOING TO PRISON.

15:35.067 --> 15:35.567
THAT'S-- OH, NO, IT-- BUT

15:35.634 --> 15:36.101
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH--

15:36.168 --> 15:36.735
SEVEN YEARS.

15:36.802 --> 15:37.369
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, I THINK

15:37.436 --> 15:38.203
I-- IT WAS AT THE TIME ONE OF

15:38.270 --> 15:38.771
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AIRLINE

15:38.837 --> 15:39.505
CAMPAIGNS EVER 'CAUSE IT WAS

15:39.571 --> 15:41.140
AIMED AT THE--

15:41.206 --> 15:41.874
I'M-- "I'M CHERYL-- FLY

15:41.940 --> 15:42.641
ME."

15:42.708 --> 15:44.143
IT WAS AIMED AT BUSINESSMEN,

15:44.209 --> 15:46.312
AND ALL THE STEWARDESSES WERE

15:46.378 --> 15:46.912
FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA

15:46.979 --> 15:47.379
AND WERE 22 YEARS OLD.

15:47.446 --> 15:47.880
THAT'S WHY THEY FLEW THE

15:47.946 --> 15:49.615
AIRLINE.

15:49.682 --> 15:50.015
OH, WOW.

15:50.082 --> 15:50.616
I'M SURPRISED THAT DIDN'T END

15:50.683 --> 15:51.483
YOUR CAREER.

15:51.550 --> 15:52.318
YEAH.

15:52.384 --> 15:53.319
IF YOU'VE OUT-MISOGYNIED ROGER

15:53.385 --> 15:54.687
AILES, THE MAN BEST KNOWN FOR

15:54.753 --> 15:57.890
SEXUALLY HARASSING SO HARD HE

15:57.956 --> 15:58.924
DIED, YOU KNOW YOU'VE MADE AN

15:58.991 --> 16:00.426
OUTRAGEOUSLY WRONG TURN.

16:00.492 --> 16:01.860
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE SAYING "YOU

16:01.927 --> 16:02.995
LOOK LOST" AND IT TURNING OUT

16:03.062 --> 16:05.564
THAT SOMEONE WAS AMELIA EARHART.

16:05.631 --> 16:08.834
YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.436
AFTER LEAVING ADVERTISING, WOLF

16:10.502 --> 16:11.870
WORKED ON COP SHOWS LIKE "HILL

16:11.937 --> 16:14.807
STREET BLUES" AND "MIAMI VICE,"

16:14.873 --> 16:15.441
AND IN 1990, HE HAD HIS MONSTER

16:15.507 --> 16:18.177
HIT, "LAW & ORDER," WHICH HE

16:18.243 --> 16:19.945
EVEN GAVE HIS OWN VERSION OF THE

16:20.012 --> 16:20.579
"DRAGNET" PREAMBLE, ONE THAT I'M

16:20.646 --> 16:21.580
GUESSING YOU CAN RECITE BY

16:21.647 --> 16:23.215
HEART.

16:24.450 --> 16:25.951
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

16:26.018 --> 16:27.052
SYSTEM, THE PEOPLE ARE

16:27.119 --> 16:28.721
REPRESENTED BY TWO SEPARATE YET

16:28.787 --> 16:30.122
EQUALLY IMPORTANT GROUPS.

16:30.189 --> 16:31.357
THE POLICE WHO INVESTIGATE CRIME

16:31.423 --> 16:32.691
AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS WHO

16:32.758 --> 16:33.192
PROSECUTE THE OFFENDERS.

16:33.258 --> 16:36.495
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

16:36.562 --> 16:37.830
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

16:37.896 --> 16:40.699
DUN-DUN."

16:40.766 --> 16:41.233
NOW, THE "THESE ARE THEIR

16:41.300 --> 16:41.734
STORIES" PART IS REALLY

16:41.800 --> 16:42.034
IMPORTANT.

16:42.101 --> 16:43.569
BECAUSE A BIG SELLING POINT FOR

16:43.635 --> 16:45.070
"LAW & ORDER" IS THAT, SIMILAR

16:45.137 --> 16:45.537
TO "DRAGNET," IT DRAWS

16:45.604 --> 16:46.505
INSPIRATION FROM REAL-LIFE

16:46.572 --> 16:49.441
CASES.

16:49.508 --> 16:50.676
IN FACT, AS WOLF RECOUNTS, WHEN

16:50.743 --> 16:51.143
THE NETWORK ASKED HIM,

16:51.210 --> 16:52.144
"WHAT'S THE BIBLE FOR THE SHOW?"

16:52.211 --> 16:52.778
HE SAID, "THE FRONT PAGE OF THE

16:52.845 --> 16:55.314
NEW YORK POST.

16:55.381 --> 16:56.815
NO WRITERS ARE GOING TO DO

16:56.882 --> 16:57.449
BETTER THAN HEADLESS BODY FOUND

16:57.516 --> 17:01.887
IN TOPLESS BAR."

17:01.954 --> 17:02.521
WHICH IS A CATCHY THING TO SAY,

17:02.588 --> 17:03.088
BUT I'M NOT SURE IT'S TRUE.

17:03.155 --> 17:03.722
"ASSLESS CORPSE FOUND AT

17:03.789 --> 17:04.156
BOTTOMLESS BRUNCH."

17:04.223 --> 17:06.792
THERE, I JUST DID IT.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.293
AND LIKE JACK WEBB IN LA, DICK

17:08.360 --> 17:09.495
WOLF CULTIVATED A CLOSE

17:09.561 --> 17:11.663
BEHIND-THE-SCENES RELATIONSHIP

17:11.730 --> 17:13.766
WITH THE NYPD, EMPLOYING FORMER

17:13.832 --> 17:14.867
OFFICERS AS CONSULTANTS, AND

17:14.933 --> 17:15.501
BOASTING ABOUT THE ACCESS HE

17:15.567 --> 17:16.568
HAD.

17:16.635 --> 17:18.137
I'VE PROBABLY SPENT MORE

17:18.203 --> 17:19.338
TIME-SPENT MORE TIME WITH COPS

17:19.405 --> 17:20.873
THAN ANYBODY WHO DOESN'T CARRY A

17:20.939 --> 17:21.340
BADGE.

17:21.407 --> 17:22.841
SO, I MEAN, WHEN YOU MEET

17:22.908 --> 17:25.077
PEOPLE, YOU MEET COPS, YOU MEET

17:25.144 --> 17:26.979
WHETHER IT'S BILL BRATTON OR RAY

17:27.045 --> 17:28.881
KELLY OR SHERIFF BACA, YOU KNOW,

17:28.947 --> 17:31.450
THERE IS A SHARED INTEREST IN

17:31.517 --> 17:34.219
PUTTING BAD GUYS AWAY AND HAVING

17:34.286 --> 17:35.954
COPS, YOU KNOW, SHOWN IN A

17:36.021 --> 17:37.523
DECENT LIGHT.

17:37.589 --> 17:38.157
I AM KIND OF UNABASHEDLY PRO LAW

17:38.223 --> 17:42.761
ENFORCEMENT.

17:42.828 --> 17:43.562
YIKES.

17:43.629 --> 17:44.029
DICK WOLF IS THE MOST

17:44.096 --> 17:45.330
ENTHUSIASTIC CHRONICLER OF BLUE

17:45.397 --> 17:48.600
LIVES SINCE JAMES CAMERON.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.803
AND WHILE NOT AS FORMAL AS

17:50.869 --> 17:51.970
"DRAGNET"'S ARRANGEMENT, "LAW &

17:52.037 --> 17:52.638
ORDER" HAS SIMILARLY BENEFITED

17:52.704 --> 17:53.238
FROM ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

17:53.305 --> 17:55.507
NYPD.

17:55.574 --> 17:56.809
ONE WRITER WHO'S WORKED ON THE

17:56.875 --> 17:57.810
SHOW HAS SAID, "THERE WAS ALWAYS

17:57.876 --> 17:59.211
THE SENSE THAT IF WE TOLD

17:59.278 --> 18:00.479
STORIES THAT REFLECTED TOO BADLY

18:00.546 --> 18:03.215
ON THE POLICE, THE NYPD COULD

18:03.282 --> 18:04.416
MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO

18:04.483 --> 18:06.084
SHOOT IN NEW YORK."

18:06.151 --> 18:07.319
WHICH DOES MAKE SENSE.

18:07.386 --> 18:08.987
THE NYPD IS FAMOUSLY

18:09.054 --> 18:10.055
ANTI-SHOOTING UNLESS THEY'RE THE

18:10.122 --> 18:12.357
ONES DOING IT.

18:12.424 --> 18:13.759
IN FACT, FOR AS MUCH AS DICK

18:13.826 --> 18:14.827
WOLF BRAGS ABOUT HOW THE SHOW IS

18:14.893 --> 18:16.528
WRITTEN IN SHADES OF GREY, OR

18:16.595 --> 18:18.096
HOW IT'LL SHOW BOTH SIDES OF AN

18:18.163 --> 18:19.598
ISSUE, THERE'S ONE SIDE THAT

18:19.665 --> 18:20.833
IT'S ALWAYS ON, AND THAT'S THE

18:20.899 --> 18:22.468
POLICE.

18:22.534 --> 18:24.236
BECAUSE HOWEVER FLAWED HIS

18:24.303 --> 18:26.104
CHARACTERS MAY BE, THEY'RE ALL,

18:26.171 --> 18:26.738
FUNDAMENTALLY, PURSUING JUSTICE

18:26.805 --> 18:29.274
- AND COPS LOVE BEING PORTRAYED

18:29.341 --> 18:30.375
THAT WAY, AS ACTORS ON THE SHOW

18:30.442 --> 18:32.578
HAVE ATTESTED OVER THE YEARS.

18:32.644 --> 18:33.479
POLICE AROUND THE COUNTRY, I

18:33.545 --> 18:34.680
MUST SAY, ARE BIG FANS OF THE

18:34.746 --> 18:35.681
SHOW BECAUSE THEY FEEL IT'S

18:35.747 --> 18:36.815
AUTHENTIC.

18:36.882 --> 18:38.350
A COUPLE HOMICIDE COPS CAME

18:38.417 --> 18:38.884
OVER TO VISIT.

18:38.951 --> 18:39.384
THEY JUST HAD WONDERFUL

18:39.451 --> 18:40.452
THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THE SHOW AND

18:40.519 --> 18:41.820
THEY SAID THANK YOU AND-- THEY

18:41.887 --> 18:42.721
WERE THANKING ME, WHICH WAS

18:42.788 --> 18:46.992
WEIRD.

18:47.059 --> 18:47.626
THEY FELT LIKE THEY WERE BEING

18:47.693 --> 18:49.528
WELL-REPRESENTED.

18:49.595 --> 18:50.629
WELL, MY FAVORITE QUOTE FROM

18:50.696 --> 18:51.497
THE POLICE IS, "KEEP MAKING US

18:51.563 --> 18:53.298
LOOK GOOD," WHICH IS A NICE

18:53.365 --> 18:53.599
COMPLIMENT.

18:53.665 --> 18:55.868
THEY'RE VERY, VERY KIND.

18:55.934 --> 18:58.704
YEAH, I BET THEY ARE!

18:58.770 --> 19:00.005
THOUGH, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

19:00.072 --> 19:02.174
THERE IS A PRETTY MAJOR

19:02.241 --> 19:02.774
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "THEY FEEL

19:02.841 --> 19:03.375
IT'S AUTHENTIC" AND "THEY FEEL

19:03.442 --> 19:04.776
IT MAKES THEM LOOK GOOD."

19:04.843 --> 19:05.611
AND IT'S THE SAME DIFFERENCE

19:05.677 --> 19:07.346
BETWEEN THESE TWO PHOTOS.

19:07.412 --> 19:09.047
ONE IS A MIRROR OF REALITY, AND

19:09.114 --> 19:12.551
THE OTHER IS A LIE.

19:12.618 --> 19:14.386
AND LOOK, THANKS TO "LAW &

19:14.453 --> 19:15.153
ORDER"'S CLOSE COLLABORATION

19:15.220 --> 19:16.188
WITH ITS POLICE CONSULTANTS, THE

19:16.255 --> 19:19.558
SHOW DOES GET A LOT OF SMALLER

19:19.625 --> 19:20.459
DETAILS RIGHT-- LIKE SPECIFIC

19:20.526 --> 19:21.093
LAWS, JARGON, AND CRIME SCENE

19:21.159 --> 19:22.394
PROCEDURES.

19:22.461 --> 19:23.795
BUT CRUCIALLY, IT ALSO MAKES A

19:23.862 --> 19:25.430
LOT OF CHOICES THAT

19:25.497 --> 19:26.899
SIGNIFICANTLY DISTORT THE BIG

19:26.965 --> 19:30.569
PICTURE OF POLICING.

19:30.636 --> 19:31.136
FOR INSTANCE, MOST EPISODES

19:31.203 --> 19:31.770
ARREST THE RIGHT PERPETRATORS AT

19:31.837 --> 19:32.871
THE MIDPOINT, AND THEN CONVICT

19:32.938 --> 19:34.172
THEM AT THE END.

19:34.239 --> 19:35.841
AND IT'S STRUCTURED LIKE THIS

19:35.908 --> 19:37.042
FOR OBVIOUS REASONS-- IT'S A

19:37.109 --> 19:37.776
SELF-CONTAINED EPISODE OF TV,

19:37.843 --> 19:39.311
AND THOSE NEED SATISFYING

19:39.378 --> 19:42.514
NARRATIVE ARC FULFILLMENT.

19:42.581 --> 19:44.816
BUT IN REALITY, NOT ONLY DO MANY

19:44.883 --> 19:45.584
CASES SIMPLY GO UNSOLVED, ALMOST

19:45.651 --> 19:49.855
NONE OF THE ONES THAT DO GET

19:49.922 --> 19:50.289
SOLVED, GO TO TRIAL.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.089
PROSECUTORS PUT MASSIVE PRESSURE

19:51.156 --> 19:52.558
ON DEFENDANTS TO TAKE PLEA

19:52.624 --> 19:55.160
DEALS, MEANING THAT 97% OF

19:55.227 --> 19:56.161
CRIMINAL CASES DON'T GO TO

19:56.228 --> 19:58.030
TRIAL.

19:58.096 --> 19:59.998
AND OBVIOUSLY, "LAW & ORDER"

20:00.065 --> 20:01.833
CAN'T REFLECT THAT REALITY.

20:01.900 --> 20:02.701
IT'D BE UNWATCHABLE.

20:02.768 --> 20:06.471
NO ONE WANTS A SHOW WHERE 97% OF

20:06.538 --> 20:07.606
EPISODES END WITH TWO LAWYERS

20:07.673 --> 20:08.774
STRIKING A DEAL IN A WINDOWLESS

20:08.840 --> 20:10.108
ROOM, AND THEN YOU GET TO WATCH

20:10.175 --> 20:12.044
THE DEFENDANT SERVE 6 MONTHS,

20:12.110 --> 20:13.845
THEN STRUGGLE TO GET A JOB AT

20:13.912 --> 20:16.648
THEIR LOCAL JIFFY LUBE.

20:16.715 --> 20:18.150
BUT THE COURTROOM HALF OF "LAW &

20:18.216 --> 20:18.951
ORDER" ACTUALLY REPRESENTS A

20:19.017 --> 20:20.018
SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE FROM TV

20:20.085 --> 20:22.054
TRADITION.

20:22.120 --> 20:23.322
BECAUSE HISTORICALLY, LAWYER

20:23.388 --> 20:24.556
SHOWS CENTERED DEFENSE LAWYERS

20:24.623 --> 20:26.024
LIKE PERRY MASON, WHO TRIED TO

20:26.091 --> 20:27.459
WORK AGAINST THE SYSTEM AS THE

20:27.526 --> 20:29.328
UNDERDOG AND FREE INNOCENT

20:29.394 --> 20:30.228
PEOPLE.

20:30.295 --> 20:33.799
BUT "LAW & ORDER" IS DIFFERENT,

20:33.865 --> 20:34.433
AND THAT'S VERY MUCH BY DESIGN.

20:34.499 --> 20:35.067
DICK WOLF HAS SAID, "I BELIEVED

20:35.133 --> 20:36.335
THE HEROES WEREN'T THE DEFENSE

20:36.401 --> 20:37.669
ATTORNEYS WHO WERE GETTING THESE

20:37.736 --> 20:40.539
SCUMBAGS OFF, THE HEROES WERE

20:40.606 --> 20:41.807
THE PROSECUTORS."

20:41.873 --> 20:43.208
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT ON HIS

20:43.275 --> 20:44.643
SHOWS, WHERE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS

20:44.710 --> 20:45.344
ARE USUALLY PRESENTED AS AN

20:45.410 --> 20:48.146
IMPEDIMENT TO CONVICTING

20:48.213 --> 20:49.014
OBVIOUSLY-GUILTY SUSPECTS, AND

20:51.316 --> 20:53.218
IF A COLD CHILL JUST RAN UP

20:53.285 --> 20:53.752
YOUR SPINE, IT'S BECAUSE A

20:53.819 --> 20:54.386
DEFENSE ATTORNEY JUST WALKED IN

20:54.453 --> 20:55.320
HERE.

20:55.387 --> 20:56.488
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS DISTORT THE

20:56.555 --> 20:56.955
FACTS.

20:57.022 --> 20:59.858
THEY TWIST EVIDENCE.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.126
I BELIEVE IN MONSTERS AND

21:01.193 --> 21:02.561
THINGS THAT GO BUMP IN THE

21:02.628 --> 21:04.696
NIGHT, JACK.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.965
MAY THEY ROT IN HELL, ALONG WITH

21:07.032 --> 21:08.133
THEIR ATTORNEYS.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.101
OH, LET ME GUESS.

21:09.167 --> 21:09.868
THE DEVIL'S ERRAND BOY,

21:09.935 --> 21:11.436
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS A

21:11.503 --> 21:12.771
DEFENSE ATTORNEY?

21:12.838 --> 21:15.707
OKAY, COUPLE THINGS.

21:15.774 --> 21:16.341
ONE, YES, THAT IS A POST-O-C

21:16.408 --> 21:17.175
MISCHA BARTON DOING SOME

21:17.242 --> 21:19.077
AWARD-WORTHY EYEBROW ACTING.

21:19.144 --> 21:20.679
BUT TWO, DEFENSE ATTORNEYS ARE A

21:20.746 --> 21:22.180
VITAL PART OF THE JUSTICE

21:22.247 --> 21:23.448
SYSTEM, SO IT'S A BIT WEIRD THAT

21:23.515 --> 21:25.317
"LAW & ORDER" CAN SOMETIMES GO

21:25.384 --> 21:26.551
OUT OF ITS WAY TO PRESENT THEM

21:26.618 --> 21:28.053
LIKE THE BABADOOK.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.288
AND AGAIN, YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY

21:30.355 --> 21:32.057
JUSTIFY THOSE DECISIONS BY

21:32.124 --> 21:33.725
SAYING, "COME ON, THEY'RE MAKING

21:33.792 --> 21:35.160
FICTION, NOT A DOCUMENTARY.

21:35.227 --> 21:35.994
NOT EVERYONE WANTS TO WATCH

21:36.061 --> 21:39.831
HYPER-REALISTIC PORTRAYALS OF

21:39.898 --> 21:40.632
OUR EVER-DESSICATING SOCIETY,

21:40.699 --> 21:43.869
JOHN."

21:43.935 --> 21:44.703
AND I DO UNDERSTAND THAT.

21:44.770 --> 21:45.504
BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE PORTRAYAL

21:45.570 --> 21:46.104
OF DEFENSE LAWYERS WHERE BIG

21:46.171 --> 21:46.738
EDITORIAL DECISIONS ARE BEING

21:46.805 --> 21:47.873
MADE.

21:47.939 --> 21:49.041
ONE STUDY FOUND THAT OFFENDERS

21:49.107 --> 21:50.509
ON "LAW & ORDER" WERE

21:50.575 --> 21:52.144
DISPROPORTIONATELY WHITE, MALE,

21:52.210 --> 21:52.811
OLDER, AND FROM THE MIDDLE OR

21:52.878 --> 21:54.579
UPPER CLASSES.

21:54.646 --> 21:55.914
DICK WOLF'S ACTUALLY EXPLAINED

21:55.981 --> 21:57.049
HIS REASONING FOR WHY THE SHOW'S

21:57.115 --> 21:58.417
CRIMINALS SKEW THAT WAY, SAYING,

21:58.483 --> 21:59.351
"THERE ARE NO RICH WHITE GUY

21:59.418 --> 22:00.786
PRESSURE GROUPS.

22:00.852 --> 22:02.054
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT TO

22:02.120 --> 22:02.654
RICH, WHITE GUYS, AND NOBODY

22:02.721 --> 22:04.589
CARES."

22:04.656 --> 22:06.658
AND YOU CAN SEE WHY HE MIGHT NOT

22:06.725 --> 22:08.226
WANT TO MAKE A SHOW IN WHICH HIS

22:08.293 --> 22:09.161
GOOD-GUY COPS ARE

22:09.227 --> 22:11.129
DISPROPORTIONATELY TARGETING

22:11.196 --> 22:13.131
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.

22:13.198 --> 22:15.367
HE WANTS PEOPLE TO LIKE THEM.

22:15.434 --> 22:16.168
BUT THE RESULT OF ALL THESE

22:16.234 --> 22:17.369
CREATIVE DECISIONS IS THAT,

22:17.436 --> 22:20.939
INSTEAD OF DEPICTING A FLAWED

22:21.006 --> 22:21.540
SYSTEM RIDDLED WITH STRUCTURAL

22:21.606 --> 22:22.074
RACISM, THE SHOW PRESENTS

22:22.140 --> 22:23.275
EXCEPTIONALLY COMPETENT COPS,

22:23.341 --> 22:24.876
WORKING WITHIN A LARGELY FAIR

22:24.943 --> 22:25.844
FRAMEWORK THAT MOSTLY CONVICTS

22:25.911 --> 22:28.480
WHITE PEOPLE.

22:28.547 --> 22:29.214
AND WHILE IT'S TRUE THAT THEY'VE

22:29.281 --> 22:30.315
OCCASIONALLY DONE EPISODES

22:30.382 --> 22:32.517
FOCUSING ON INDIVIDUAL BAD COPS,

22:32.584 --> 22:33.251
OR REFERENCED REAL-WORLD

22:33.318 --> 22:33.785
CRITICISMS-- ESPECIALLY

22:33.852 --> 22:38.190
RECENTLY, WITH DISCUSSIONS OF

22:38.256 --> 22:38.757
ANTI-POLICE SENTIMENT BEING

22:38.824 --> 22:40.592
SHOEHORNED INTO CONVERSATIONS--

22:40.659 --> 22:41.893
IN GENERAL, POLICE REFORMS ARE

22:41.960 --> 22:43.328
OFTEN PORTRAYED BY THE MAIN

22:43.395 --> 22:45.430
CHARACTERS AS AT BEST A NUISANCE

22:45.497 --> 22:46.798
TO THEM, AND AT WORST A THREAT

22:46.865 --> 22:48.600
TO PUBLIC SAFETY.

22:48.667 --> 22:49.568
16 MURDERS OVER FOURTH OF

22:49.634 --> 22:51.336
JULY.

22:51.403 --> 22:52.871
THEY CUT BACK ON THE STOP AND

22:52.938 --> 22:54.306
SEARCHES, PEOPLE START CARRYING.

22:54.372 --> 22:54.906
YOU TWO HAD HIM YESTERDAY,

22:54.973 --> 22:56.074
AND YOU LET HIM GO?

22:56.141 --> 22:56.708
THERE WASN'T PROBABLE CAUSE

22:56.775 --> 22:57.709
FOR AN ARREST.

22:57.776 --> 22:58.877
YOU CREATE PROBABLE CAUSE.

22:58.944 --> 22:59.711
YOU PUSH HIM AROUND, YOU PROVOKE

22:59.778 --> 23:01.480
HIM!

23:01.546 --> 23:03.115
AFTER ERIC GARNER AND THE

23:03.181 --> 23:03.815
STOP-AND-FRISK LAWSUITS, 1PP'S

23:03.882 --> 23:05.283
BEEN VERY CLEAR.

23:05.350 --> 23:06.251
DON'T MAKE A SCENE.

23:06.318 --> 23:09.221
LIKE IT OR NOT, NOLAN, THE

23:09.287 --> 23:11.556
BIG BAD POLICE DEPARTMENT IS OUR

23:11.623 --> 23:11.923
PARTNER.

23:11.990 --> 23:14.259
AND IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN

23:14.326 --> 23:14.893
PAYING ATTENTION, THEY'RE UNDER

23:14.960 --> 23:15.360
ATTACK.

23:15.427 --> 23:16.661
EVERY DECISION, EVERY ARREST IS

23:16.728 --> 23:18.396
SCRUTINIZED.

23:18.463 --> 23:19.898
THERE ARE PEOPLE TRYING TO

23:19.965 --> 23:21.733
DEFUND THEM, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.502
AND HERE YOU ARE, ASKING ME TO

23:23.568 --> 23:24.770
CASTRATE THEM?

23:24.836 --> 23:26.838
OH, NO!

23:26.905 --> 23:33.011
SCRUTINIZING ARRESTS?!

23:33.078 --> 23:33.311
HOW AWFUL!

23:33.378 --> 23:33.912
IT'S PRETTY TELLING THAT, EVEN

23:33.979 --> 23:34.780
IN THIS FICTIONAL UNIVERSE,

23:34.846 --> 23:35.647
BASIC POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY IS

23:35.714 --> 23:36.214
TREATED AS AN EQUIVALENT TO

23:36.281 --> 23:38.650
GETTING YOUR BALLS CUT OFF.

23:38.717 --> 23:39.384
BUT MAYBE THE BEST EXPRESSION OF

23:39.451 --> 23:42.687
THE DISPARITY BETWEEN "LAW &

23:42.754 --> 23:43.288
ORDER" AND REAL LIFE IS IN ITS

23:43.355 --> 23:45.690
MOST POPULAR SPINOFF, "SVU."

23:45.757 --> 23:47.259
IT'S A SHOW BUILT ON THE APPEAL

23:47.325 --> 23:48.894
OF HAVING COPS WHO'LL STOP AT

23:48.960 --> 23:51.429
NOTHING TO CRACK HORRIFIC CASES.

23:51.496 --> 23:52.831
COPS LIKE ELLIOTT STABLER,

23:52.898 --> 23:54.299
WHO-- BEFORE GETTING A SPINOFF

23:54.366 --> 23:55.066
SHOW-- ROUTINELY DID SHIT LIKE

23:56.835 --> 23:58.236
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

23:58.303 --> 23:59.638
HEY!

23:59.704 --> 24:00.272
I GET A LITTLE CLUMSY AROUND

24:00.338 --> 24:02.340
SCUMBAG PEDOPHILES.

24:02.407 --> 24:03.108
WHY YOU GOT TO BE SO ROUGH?

24:03.175 --> 24:03.675
BECAUSE YOU STILL GOT ONE

24:03.742 --> 24:05.644
GOOD ARM LEFT TO BREAK.

24:05.710 --> 24:06.511
I SHOULD PUT YOU IN PIGTAILS,

24:06.578 --> 24:07.445
YOU LITTLE BITCH.

24:07.512 --> 24:08.013
COME ON, YOU LITTLE BITCH, I

24:08.079 --> 24:09.314
WANT YOU TO CRY FOR ME.

24:09.381 --> 24:10.282
COME ON, TELL ME!

24:10.348 --> 24:12.150
COME ON!

24:12.217 --> 24:13.285
CRY FOR ME!

24:13.351 --> 24:13.885
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL

24:13.952 --> 24:16.788
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

24:16.855 --> 24:17.823
DO YOU THINK I AM SOME DUMB

24:17.889 --> 24:18.523
COP?

24:18.590 --> 24:19.591
I HAD NOTHING TO--

24:19.658 --> 24:20.525
ELLIOT.

24:20.592 --> 24:21.226
YOU THINK YOU'RE SMARTER THAN

24:21.293 --> 24:21.459
ME?

24:21.526 --> 24:22.160
I NEED A DOCTOR.

24:22.227 --> 24:22.761
YOU'RE GONNA NEED A MORGUE,

24:22.828 --> 24:23.829
PAL.

24:23.895 --> 24:24.696
LEAVE WILL ARNETT

24:24.763 --> 24:27.632
ALONE!

24:27.699 --> 24:29.334
LOOK, I ADMIT, AS A VIEWER, IT

24:29.401 --> 24:31.870
IS SOMETHING TO SEE STABLER CHEW

24:31.937 --> 24:33.605
UP THE SCENERY AND SPIT IT OUT

24:33.672 --> 24:34.906
DIRECTLY INTO MATTHEW MODINE'S

24:34.973 --> 24:36.107
FACE.

24:36.174 --> 24:36.741
IS IT THE MODEL OF GOOD POLICE

24:36.808 --> 24:37.342
BEHAVIOR?

24:37.409 --> 24:38.810
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

24:38.877 --> 24:39.744
IS IT COMPELLING TO WATCH?

24:39.811 --> 24:40.412
FOR SURE.

24:40.478 --> 24:42.848
IS IT HOT?

24:42.914 --> 24:45.917
REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE.

24:45.984 --> 24:48.019
BUT GENERALLY, THE THESIS ON

24:48.086 --> 24:50.288
"SVU" IS THAT THE COPS DEEPLY

24:50.355 --> 24:51.523
CARE ABOUT GETTING JUSTICE FOR

24:51.590 --> 24:53.758
VICTIMS, AND THEIR GUT INSTINCTS

24:53.825 --> 24:55.327
MEAN THEY ALMOST ALWAYS GET THE

24:55.393 --> 24:56.461
JOB DONE IN THE END.

24:56.528 --> 24:57.596
IN ONE EPISODE, WE LEARN THAT

24:57.662 --> 24:59.464
STABLER HAS A 97% CASE CLOSURE

24:59.531 --> 25:00.732
RATE.

25:00.799 --> 25:03.501
AND PEOPLE LOVE THIS SHOW.

25:03.568 --> 25:04.736
CHRISTOPHER MELONI IS THE

25:04.803 --> 25:06.004
INTERNET'S "ZADDY," AND YOU CAN

25:06.071 --> 25:08.039
SEE WHY-- HIS ASS ALONE IS A

25:08.106 --> 25:10.308
POP-CULTURE ICON.

25:10.375 --> 25:11.610
AND MARISKA HARGITAY HAS A HUGE

25:11.676 --> 25:13.178
CULT FOLLOWING, TOO.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.847
FANS HAVE TATTOOS OF HER, TAYLOR

25:15.914 --> 25:17.449
SWIFT HAS A CAT NAMED FOR HER

25:17.515 --> 25:18.583
CHARACTER, OLIVIA BENSON, AND

25:18.650 --> 25:20.552
THERE ARE EVEN TIKTOKS LIKE

25:20.819 --> 25:21.353
DIDDLE YOU WHEN YOU WERE A

25:21.419 --> 25:21.519
KID?

25:21.586 --> 25:22.287
DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL?

25:36.468 --> 25:37.435
IN GENERAL, I THINK

25:37.502 --> 25:38.603
I'VE MADE MY POSITION ON POLICE

25:38.670 --> 25:40.038
BRUTALITY PRETTY CLEAR.

25:40.105 --> 25:42.007
BUT I'LL ADMIT, IT'S HARD TO

25:42.073 --> 25:43.341
RESIST THE SIGHT OF OLIVIA

25:43.408 --> 25:44.042
BENSON SLAMMING AN ASSHOLE'S

25:44.109 --> 25:48.647
HEAD ON A TABLE TO THE BEAT OF

25:48.713 --> 25:49.047
"HOLLABACK GIRL."

25:49.114 --> 25:49.447
GO OFF, GIRL BOSS!

25:49.514 --> 25:49.981
LEAN IN TO STATE SPONSORED

25:50.048 --> 25:53.785
VIOLENCE!

25:53.852 --> 25:54.853
AND THERE'S SOMETHING INCREDIBLY

25:54.920 --> 25:56.788
APPEALING ABOUT THE IDEA OF A

25:56.855 --> 25:57.822
WORLD WHERE SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL

25:57.889 --> 25:59.090
ASSAULT ARE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY

25:59.157 --> 25:59.958
THE POLICE.

26:00.025 --> 26:01.026
HARGITAY'S EVEN SPOKEN ABOUT

26:01.092 --> 26:02.827
SOME OF THE SHOW'S POSITIVE

26:02.894 --> 26:04.729
REAL-WORLD IMPACTS.

26:04.796 --> 26:08.400
I HAVE SO MANY TIMES

26:08.466 --> 26:10.869
ENCOUNTERED PEOPLE THAT HAVE

26:10.936 --> 26:13.071
SAID BECAUSE OF THIS SHOW THEY

26:13.138 --> 26:14.339
KNEW WHAT TO DO AFTER THEIR

26:14.406 --> 26:16.207
ASSAULT.

26:16.274 --> 26:18.043
BECAUSE OF THIS SHOW, THEY HAD A

26:18.109 --> 26:20.712
RAPE KIT DONE.

26:20.779 --> 26:22.180
BECAUSE OF THE SHOW, THEY

26:22.247 --> 26:24.516
REPORTED AND HAD FAITH IN THAT.

26:24.582 --> 26:26.217
AND BECAUSE OF THE SHOW, MOST OF

26:26.284 --> 26:26.785
ALL, THEY DIDN'T FEEL ALONE

26:26.851 --> 26:32.924
ANYMORE.

26:32.991 --> 26:34.726
AND TO ME, WHEN I STARTED

26:34.793 --> 26:36.027
HEARING THOSE STORIES IS WHEN I

26:36.094 --> 26:37.462
KNEW THAT IT WASN'T JUST A TV

26:37.529 --> 26:39.331
SHOW ANYMORE.

26:39.397 --> 26:40.832
IT WAS SO MUCH MORE.

26:40.899 --> 26:41.833
YEAH, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY

26:41.900 --> 26:43.835
MOVING.

26:43.902 --> 26:45.270
AND I DON'T DOUBT THE SHOW IS

26:45.337 --> 26:46.938
DOING IMPORTANT WORK FOR SOME OF

26:47.005 --> 26:50.442
ITS VIEWERS, IN BETWEEN SHOWING

26:50.508 --> 26:51.810
HER SLAMMING A SUSPECT'S FACE

26:51.876 --> 26:53.211
INTO A TABLE LIKE SHE'S A

26:53.278 --> 26:55.080
TODDLER MAKING TWO BARBIES KISS.

26:55.146 --> 26:57.716
AND TO HER CREDIT, MARISKA

26:57.782 --> 26:58.717
HARGITAY HAS TRIED TO PARLAY HER

26:58.783 --> 27:00.051
FAME INTO ADVOCACY, FOUNDING AN

27:00.118 --> 27:01.886
ORGANIZATION WHICH ADVOCATES FOR

27:01.953 --> 27:03.154
SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT,

27:03.221 --> 27:05.023
DOMESTIC ABUSE, AND CHILD ABUSE.

27:05.090 --> 27:06.591
BUT IF, AS HARGITAY SAYS, THE

27:06.658 --> 27:09.494
SHOW ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO AVAIL

27:09.561 --> 27:11.896
THEMSELVES OF THIS SYSTEM, IT'S

27:11.963 --> 27:12.764
WORTH KNOWING WHAT THAT SYSTEM

27:12.831 --> 27:14.232
CAN LOOK LIKE IN PRACTICE.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.700
BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOOD.

27:15.767 --> 27:16.901
GOVERNMENT AND PRESS REPORTS

27:16.968 --> 27:19.337
HAVE REPEATEDLY SHOWN THAT

27:19.404 --> 27:20.472
NEW YORK'S ACTUAL SEX CRIMES

27:20.538 --> 27:22.674
UNIT IS SET UP TO FAIL VICTIMS

27:22.741 --> 27:24.642
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.

27:24.709 --> 27:25.777
BECAUSE ITS CASE CLOSURE RATE IS

27:25.844 --> 27:34.452
A LONG WAY FROM ELLIOT STABLER'S

27:34.519 --> 27:34.786
97%.

27:34.853 --> 27:35.420
THE NYPD'S OFFICIAL FIGURES SHOW

27:35.487 --> 27:36.087
THEY ONLY CLOSE ABOUT A THIRD OF

27:36.154 --> 27:36.588
SEXUAL-ASSAULT CASES.

27:36.654 --> 27:38.123
BUT ONE ANALYSIS OF CASES

27:38.189 --> 27:42.494
HANDLED OVER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD

27:42.560 --> 27:43.228
FOUND A CLOSURE RATE OF JUST 6%.

27:43.294 --> 27:46.631
AND A DAMNING 2018 INVESTIGATION

27:46.698 --> 27:47.198
INTO NEW YORK'S SVD QUOTED

27:47.265 --> 27:47.832
MULTIPLE PROSECUTORS DESCRIBING

27:47.899 --> 27:48.500
IMPROPER HANDLING OF CASES BY

27:48.566 --> 27:50.602
OVERLOADED OR INEXPERIENCED

27:50.668 --> 27:51.503
INVESTIGATORS, WHO UNTIL

27:51.569 --> 27:53.405
RECENTLY WERE ONLY GIVEN FIVE

27:53.471 --> 27:55.040
DAYS OF FORMAL SPECIALIZED

27:55.106 --> 27:57.108
TRAINING.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.243
IS IT ANY WONDER THAT SOME COPS

27:58.309 --> 28:00.412
ARE WATCHING "SVU" FOR TIPS?

28:00.478 --> 28:01.513
WHICH MAY NOT BE SUCH A BAD

28:01.579 --> 28:03.181
THING WHEN YOU GET JUSTICE

28:03.248 --> 28:04.349
CRUSADER OLIVIA BENSON, BUT GETS

28:04.416 --> 28:07.018
A LITTLE HAIRY WHEN YOU GET USE

28:07.085 --> 28:09.587
OF EXCESSIVE FORCE ZADDY.

28:09.654 --> 28:10.855
AND WHILE THE NYPD INSISTS

28:10.922 --> 28:12.357
THEY'VE SINCE IMPROVED STAFFING

28:12.424 --> 28:14.259
AND TRAINING, THE DOJ RECENTLY

28:14.325 --> 28:15.527
ANNOUNCED THEIR OWN

28:15.593 --> 28:16.995
INVESTIGATION, CITING REPORTS

28:17.062 --> 28:18.363
THAT THE UNIT'S OFFICERS WERE

28:18.430 --> 28:19.297
"FAILING TO CONDUCT BASIC

28:19.364 --> 28:20.632
INVESTIGATIVE STEPS AND INSTEAD

28:20.698 --> 28:25.036
SHAMING AND ABUSING SURVIVORS

28:25.103 --> 28:25.703
AND RE-TRAUMATIZING THEM DURING

28:25.770 --> 28:26.438
INVESTIGATIONS."

28:26.504 --> 28:27.639
AND YET, THE PORTRAIT "SVU"

28:27.705 --> 28:29.774
PAINTS OF THE DIVISION IS SO

28:29.841 --> 28:30.809
CONVINCING THAT WHEN A NEW

28:30.875 --> 28:33.745
COMMANDER TOOK OVER IN 2020, IN

28:33.812 --> 28:34.679
AN INTERVIEW THAT DISCUSSED THAT

28:34.746 --> 28:36.614
SCATHING INTERNAL REPORT I JUST

28:36.681 --> 28:39.184
MENTIONED, HERE'S HOW THE ANCHOR

28:39.250 --> 28:40.318
WRAPPED UP THE CONVERSATION.

28:40.385 --> 28:42.220
YOU KNOW I'M GONNA ASK THIS

28:42.287 --> 28:44.255
BECAUSE I'M OBSESSED WITH THE TV

28:44.322 --> 28:45.190
SHOW "LAW & ORDER: SVU," HOW

28:45.256 --> 28:47.792
REAL IS THE TV SHOW TO REAL

28:47.859 --> 28:50.895
LIFE?

28:50.962 --> 28:53.064
I CAN TELL YOU THIS, THE

28:53.131 --> 28:54.632
DEDICATION YOU SEE ON TV WITH

28:54.699 --> 28:55.834
THE INVESTIGATORS, THAT'S THE

28:55.900 --> 28:56.234
SAME DEDICATION--

28:56.301 --> 28:56.868
YEAH.

28:56.935 --> 28:58.770
THAT WE HAVE WITHIN THE REAL

28:58.837 --> 29:00.772
SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT AND THE

29:00.839 --> 29:03.074
CASES ARE VERY, VERY SIMILAR.

29:03.141 --> 29:04.742
AS HEINOUS AS YOU SEE THEM ON

29:04.809 --> 29:06.211
TV, WE ARE SEEING THE SAME THING

29:06.277 --> 29:07.846
IN REAL LIFE.

29:07.912 --> 29:09.414
SO MANY OF THEM ARE RIPPED

29:09.481 --> 29:10.548
FROM THE HEADLINES, YOU KNOW.

29:10.615 --> 29:11.449
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:11.516 --> 29:14.819
WHY STOP THE FAWNING THERE?

29:14.886 --> 29:15.453
JUST KEEP IT GOING!

29:15.520 --> 29:16.054
"ARE YOU REALLY AS COOL AS YOU

29:16.121 --> 29:16.554
SEEM ON TV?

29:16.621 --> 29:17.989
DO YOU SOMETIMES MAKE THE CAR GO

29:18.056 --> 29:19.524
WEE-WOO EVEN IF IT DOESN'T NEED

29:19.591 --> 29:20.225
TO GO WEE-WOO?

29:20.291 --> 29:24.195
IS ICE-T NICE?"

29:24.262 --> 29:25.730
AND IT'S WORTH KNOWING: SOME

29:25.797 --> 29:26.998
SURVIVORS HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT WHAT

29:27.065 --> 29:29.067
IT'S LIKE SEEING THESE

29:29.134 --> 29:30.301
DETECTIVES VALORIZED ON TV, WITH

29:30.368 --> 29:32.237
ONE SAYING, "LAW & ORDER: SVU"

29:32.303 --> 29:34.639
GAVE ME THE FALSE IMPRESSION

29:34.706 --> 29:36.508
THAT THIS SQUAD CARED DEEPLY

29:36.574 --> 29:38.943
ABOUT VICTIMS AND THEIR JOBS,

29:39.010 --> 29:39.811
AND ANOTHER SAYING, "IF I HAD A

29:39.878 --> 29:41.179
DOLLAR FOR EVERY TIME I HEARD,

29:41.246 --> 29:41.679
'THIS CAN'T BE TRUE.

29:41.746 --> 29:42.614
OLIVIA BENSON WOULD NEVER LET

29:42.680 --> 29:43.148
THIS HAPPEN!' I WOULD HAVE

29:43.214 --> 29:44.616
ENOUGH TO COVER MY HOSPITAL

29:44.682 --> 29:45.150
BILLS AND THERAPY FOR MY

29:45.216 --> 29:47.118
TRAUMA."

29:47.185 --> 29:48.353
EVEN THE

29:48.419 --> 29:51.389
REAL-WORLD VERSION OF THE

29:51.456 --> 29:55.894
TENACIOUS, UNCOMPROMISING OLIVIA

29:55.960 --> 29:58.596
BENSON, AND THE SHOW'S TOUGH

29:58.663 --> 29:59.164
ADA, ALEXANDRA CABOT, HAS A

29:59.230 --> 29:59.998
SIGNIFICANT ASTERISK, BECAUSE A

30:00.064 --> 30:01.065
MAJOR INSPIRATION FOR BOTH

30:01.132 --> 30:02.000
CHARACTERS IS LINDA FAIRSTEIN,

30:02.066 --> 30:03.067
THE WOMAN INFAMOUS FOR

30:03.134 --> 30:04.269
PROSECUTING THE CENTRAL PARK

30:04.335 --> 30:06.104
FIVE, OR AS THEY'RE NOW KNOWN,

30:06.171 --> 30:07.739
THE EXONERATED FIVE.

30:07.805 --> 30:09.407
SOME BEHIND THE

30:09.474 --> 30:12.510
SHOW ARE AWARE OF ITS ROLE IN

30:12.577 --> 30:13.244
PERPETUATING A FALSE NARRATIVE

30:13.311 --> 30:14.145
ABOUT POLICE.

30:14.212 --> 30:16.814
IN FACT, IN 2020, AT THE PEAK OF

30:16.881 --> 30:18.149
THE BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTS,

30:18.216 --> 30:19.651
WARREN LEIGHT REFLECTED ON THE

30:19.717 --> 30:20.685
ROLE THE SHOW PLAYS IN OUR

30:20.752 --> 30:22.320
DISCUSSION OF POLICING.

30:22.387 --> 30:24.756
SO, YOU KNOW, INDIVIDUALLY,

30:24.822 --> 30:26.658
AM I DOING-- AM I CONTRIBUTING

30:26.724 --> 30:27.892
- MIS-CONTRIBUTING TO SOCIETY?

30:27.959 --> 30:28.259
I DON'T KNOW.

30:28.326 --> 30:29.060
COLLECTIVELY, ARE WE?

30:29.127 --> 30:31.029
YEAH.

30:31.095 --> 30:32.297
SO-- SO, HOW DO YOU-WHAT DO YOU

30:32.363 --> 30:33.598
DO?

30:33.665 --> 30:38.836
CAN YOU GO INTO THE NETWORK?

30:38.903 --> 30:40.705
I HAVE PITCHED THE-- BY THE

30:40.772 --> 30:41.906
WAY, I THINK EVERY WRITER HAS

30:41.973 --> 30:44.576
PITCHED THE INNOCENCE PROJECT

30:44.642 --> 30:45.143
SERIES TO THE NETWORKS.

30:45.210 --> 30:45.610
I'VE MADE THAT PITCH.

30:45.677 --> 30:46.244
I BET IT HAS A BETTER CHANCE OF

30:46.311 --> 30:46.511
GOING NOW.

30:46.578 --> 30:47.412
AND WITHIN THE DICK WOLF LAW AND

30:47.478 --> 30:49.314
ORDER UNIVERSE, IT WON'T BE

30:49.380 --> 30:51.482
LIKELY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO

30:51.549 --> 30:54.219
A SHOW THAT REVEALS THAT-- THAT

30:54.285 --> 30:55.753
BASES ITSELF ON COPS BEHAVING

30:55.820 --> 30:58.990
ILLEGAL.

30:59.057 --> 31:02.460
THAT'S NOT PART OF-- OF THAT--

31:02.527 --> 31:03.861
OF DICK'S BRAND.

31:03.928 --> 31:05.430
EXACTLY.

31:05.496 --> 31:07.432
EVEN IF THE PEOPLE WORKING ON

31:07.498 --> 31:12.537
THE SHOW-- THE ACTORS, WRITERS

31:12.604 --> 31:13.104
AND SHOWRUNNERS-- HAVE GOOD

31:13.171 --> 31:13.738
INTENTIONS ABOUT CORRECTING THE

31:13.805 --> 31:14.305
RECORD, THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH

31:14.372 --> 31:14.973
THEY CAN DO.

31:15.039 --> 31:16.474
"LAW & ORDER" IS NEVER GOING TO

31:16.541 --> 31:17.742
GRAPPLE WITH THE REALITY OF

31:17.809 --> 31:18.977
POLICING IN A MEANINGFUL WAY,

31:19.043 --> 31:21.112
FOR THE SAME REASONS DANIEL

31:21.179 --> 31:22.480
TIGER WON'T.

31:22.547 --> 31:23.815
IT'S JUST NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN,

31:23.881 --> 31:24.849
AND HONESTLY, YOU'D BE PRETTY

31:24.916 --> 31:27.018
WEIRDED OUT IF IT DID.

31:27.085 --> 31:28.386
BECAUSE FUNDAMENTALLY, THE

31:28.453 --> 31:30.188
PERSON WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR

31:30.255 --> 31:31.856
"LAW & ORDER" AND ITS BRAND IS

31:31.923 --> 31:33.124
DICK WOLF.

31:33.191 --> 31:35.793
AND HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT HE

31:35.860 --> 31:37.462
WANTS HE WANTS HIS SHOW TO DO,

31:37.528 --> 31:38.863
AND-- IMPORTANTLY-- NOT TO DO.

31:38.930 --> 31:39.897
HERE HE IS INVOKING ONE OF THE

31:39.964 --> 31:41.399
MOST NOTORIOUS CASES OF POLICE

31:41.466 --> 31:43.301
ABUSE IN NEW YORK CITY, ABNER

31:43.368 --> 31:44.702
LOUIMA, WHO WAS BEATEN BY NYPD

31:44.769 --> 31:48.840
OFFICERS AND SODOMIZED IN 1997.

31:48.906 --> 31:51.476
WE'RE NOT THERE TO DO ABNER

31:51.542 --> 31:54.212
LOUIMA.

31:54.279 --> 31:54.946
THAT'S, YOU KNOW, THAT'S A

31:55.013 --> 31:56.914
TERRIBLE THING THAT HAPPENED BUT

31:56.981 --> 31:58.016
THAT REPRESENTS ONE OR TWO BAD

31:58.082 --> 31:58.616
APPLES IN A POLICE FORCE OF

31:58.683 --> 32:01.252
35,000 PEOPLE.

32:01.319 --> 32:03.121
WE'RE CERTAINLY THE SHOW--

32:03.187 --> 32:06.291
ALL THREE SHOWS ARE PROBABLY THE

32:06.357 --> 32:07.458
BEST RECRUITING POSTER YOU COULD

32:07.525 --> 32:09.294
HAVE FOR BEING A NEW YORK CITY

32:09.360 --> 32:14.666
COP.

32:14.732 --> 32:15.266
RIGHT.

32:15.333 --> 32:15.867
BECAUSE A RECRUITING POSTER IS

32:15.933 --> 32:16.301
ALWAYS GOING TO BE A

32:16.367 --> 32:16.834
PROPAGANDIZED, HERO-WASHED

32:16.901 --> 32:17.402
VERSION OF THE TRUTH.

32:17.468 --> 32:18.703
A TRUTH WHICH IS MORE OFTEN THAN

32:18.770 --> 32:20.338
NOT, VERY UGLY.

32:20.405 --> 32:22.573
AND FOR THE 300TH TIME, I KNOW

32:22.640 --> 32:24.175
"LAW & ORDER" IS JUST A TV SHOW.

32:24.242 --> 32:25.209
I KNOW IT'S MEANT TO BE

32:25.276 --> 32:27.345
ENTERTAINMENT.

32:27.412 --> 32:28.313
AND HONESTLY, I'M NOT EVEN

32:28.379 --> 32:29.614
TELLING YOU NOT TO WATCH IT.

32:29.681 --> 32:31.082
IT'S COMPLETELY FINE TO ENJOY

32:31.149 --> 32:33.351
IT, AND IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE TO

32:33.418 --> 32:35.787
WANT OLIVIA BENSON TO EXIST.

32:35.853 --> 32:37.488
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

32:37.555 --> 32:39.123
JUST HOW FAR IT IS FROM

32:39.190 --> 32:40.058
REPRESENTING ANYTHING RESEMBLING

32:40.124 --> 32:41.759
REALITY.

32:41.826 --> 32:43.027
AS ONE CRITIC OF "LAW & ORDER"

32:43.094 --> 32:44.862
HAS PUT IT, "IF A MEDICAL SHOW

32:44.929 --> 32:46.731
WAS GIVING US INACCURATE

32:46.798 --> 32:47.732
INFORMATION, WE WOULD SAY IT'S

32:47.799 --> 32:48.966
DANGEROUS."

32:49.033 --> 32:50.568
WHICH IS TRUE, BECAUSE THINK

32:50.635 --> 32:51.669
ABOUT IT-- YOU KNOW

32:51.736 --> 32:53.104
"GREY'S ANATOMY" DOESN'T DEPICT

32:53.171 --> 32:53.871
WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE AN ACTUAL

32:53.938 --> 32:55.640
HOSPITAL.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.675
THOSE DOCTORS ARE RIDICULOUSLY

32:57.742 --> 32:58.643
HOT, NONE OF THEM ARE NEARLY

32:58.710 --> 33:00.111
TIRED ENOUGH, AND IT NEEDS ABOUT

33:00.178 --> 33:02.747
5000% MORE DISCUSSION OF

33:02.814 --> 33:04.682
INSURANCE.

33:04.749 --> 33:06.217
BUT IF THOSE MEDICAL

33:06.284 --> 33:07.385
PROFESSIONALS WERE ROUTINELY

33:07.452 --> 33:08.486
CLAIMING THAT VACCINES CAUSE

33:08.553 --> 33:10.988
AUTISM AND HERBAL REMEDIES CURE

33:11.055 --> 33:13.558
CANCER, WE'D PROBABLY BE HAVING

33:13.624 --> 33:14.525
A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT.

33:14.592 --> 33:15.626
BECAUSE THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT

33:15.693 --> 33:17.495
"LAW & ORDER" IS DOING.

33:17.562 --> 33:18.863
IT'S PRESENTING A WORLD WHERE

33:18.930 --> 33:20.231
THE COPS CAN ALWAYS FIGURE OUT

33:20.298 --> 33:22.467
WHO DID IT, DEFENSE ATTORNEYS

33:22.533 --> 33:23.801
ARE IRRITATING OBSTACLES TO BE

33:23.868 --> 33:24.602
OVERCOME, AND EVEN IF A COP

33:24.669 --> 33:28.973
ROUGHS UP A SUSPECT, IT'S ALL IN

33:29.040 --> 33:29.507
PURSUIT OF A JUST OUTCOME.

33:29.574 --> 33:30.842
AND IT BLASTS THAT FANTASY AT

33:30.908 --> 33:32.343
YOU IN ENDLESS RERUNS AND

33:32.410 --> 33:34.479
MARATHONS, IN THE GUISE OF VERY

33:34.545 --> 33:37.882
WELL-PRODUCED TV.

33:37.949 --> 33:40.785
BUT UNDERNEATH IT ALL, IT'S A

33:40.852 --> 33:41.919
COMMERCIAL, PRODUCED BY A MAN

33:41.986 --> 33:43.020
WHO IS, IN HIS WORDS,

33:43.087 --> 33:45.323
"UNABASHEDLY PRO-LAW

33:45.390 --> 33:46.657
ENFORCEMENT," AND IS VERY GOOD

33:46.724 --> 33:48.292
AT SELLING THINGS.

33:48.359 --> 33:50.027
AND IN THIS INSTANCE, HE'S

33:50.094 --> 33:51.562
SELLING A COMPLETE FANTASY THAT

33:51.629 --> 33:53.564
MANY PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE

33:53.631 --> 33:55.566
ONLY TOO HAPPY TO BUY.

33:55.633 --> 33:57.235
WHICH IS FINE-- AS LONG AS WE

33:57.301 --> 33:58.603

34:16.154 --> 34:17.355

34:17.422 --> 34:18.890
AND THAT'S THIS.
