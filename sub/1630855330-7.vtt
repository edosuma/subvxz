<i>Previously on</i>
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds...

00:27.505 --> 00:28.506
<i>
Uhura,</i>

00:28.506 --> 00:29.551
you have a textbook case

00:29.551 --> 00:31.248
of overwork and exhaustion.

00:31.248 --> 00:32.510
You haven't been sleeping.

00:32.510 --> 00:35.731
It's been busy... Here.

00:35.731 --> 00:38.255
<i>
You protected the timeline.</i>

00:38.255 --> 00:40.083
<i>
This is a fork in the road.
Your future</i>

00:40.083 --> 00:41.780
and mine, diverging.

00:41.780 --> 00:42.912
<i>LA'AN:
Starfleet has regulations</i>

00:42.912 --> 00:44.479
<i>for situations like this.</i>

00:46.742 --> 00:48.222
You're pirates.

00:48.222 --> 00:49.614
It's an Orion specialty.

00:49.614 --> 00:51.616
<i>
Spock is my friend.</i>

00:51.616 --> 00:52.878
I have to tell you...

00:52.878 --> 00:54.184
<i>
It's complicated.</i>

00:54.184 --> 00:56.317
<i>
Then make it simple.</i>

00:56.317 --> 00:59.059
<i>
I wish we had more connection.</i>

01:02.627 --> 01:06.240
<i>
Ensign's log, stardate 58460.1.</i>

01:06.240 --> 01:09.330
<i>The</i> Cerritos <i>has just entered
the orbit of Krulmuth-B.</i>

01:09.330 --> 01:11.071
<i>Home of the Krulmuth-B portal,</i>

01:11.071 --> 01:13.073
<i>one of my all-time
favorite portals.</i>

01:13.073 --> 01:15.075
We're taking routine
portal readings and making sure

01:15.075 --> 01:17.251
the portal area
is free of any portal problems.

01:17.251 --> 01:19.122
Stop.
How are you so excited

01:19.122 --> 01:21.298
for some random portal
nobody's ever heard of?

01:21.298 --> 01:22.734
History buffs have.

01:22.734 --> 01:24.171
It was discovered
by Captain Pike

01:24.171 --> 01:25.476
and the original
crew of the <i>Enterprise.</i>

01:25.476 --> 01:26.782
I-I mean, the second <i>Enterprise,</i>

01:26.782 --> 01:28.175
- but technically...
- Uh, yeah. Okay,

01:28.175 --> 01:29.263
it's gonna be like
every other portal,

01:29.263 --> 01:30.351
and we're just running scans.

01:30.351 --> 01:31.526
Because it might do something.

01:31.526 --> 01:34.398
Which it hasn't.
In 120 years.

01:34.398 --> 01:35.965
Yeah, it's due.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.575
Can you imagine
what it must have been like

01:37.575 --> 01:39.664
to be with Those Old Scientists?
I mean, this is as close

01:39.664 --> 01:41.666
as we'll get
to Spock or Numero Una.

01:41.666 --> 01:43.407
Don't call her that.
No one called her that.

01:43.407 --> 01:46.454
Come on, we're gonna be standing
in the same spot as Uhura.

01:46.454 --> 01:47.977
That doesn't get you
a little excited?

01:47.977 --> 01:50.022
Yeah, Uhura was cool as hell.
Probably because

01:50.022 --> 01:52.677
she had a life outside of work.
You should try it.

01:52.677 --> 01:56.333
Okey dokey, who's pumped to scan
some teleron radiation?

01:56.333 --> 01:58.161
Ugh, you're excited
about this, too?

01:58.161 --> 02:00.076
Guys, a broken portal
is just a tunnel.

02:00.076 --> 02:01.904
I love scanning new things
for my collection.

02:01.904 --> 02:04.080
Radiation's a super useful
form of energy.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.864
Ha-ha! Science!

02:05.864 --> 02:08.606
Oh, the bar to excite you guys
could not be lower.

02:08.606 --> 02:10.173
- Pretty great, huh?
- All right, let's just

02:10.173 --> 02:11.696
get going. I can...
I'll brief you on the way.

02:11.696 --> 02:13.220
Wait, you're in charge?

02:13.220 --> 02:15.135
Yep.
Job of a lifetime.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.179
But you think
portals are boring.

02:16.179 --> 02:17.528
Why would they choose you?

02:17.528 --> 02:18.877
Probably 'cause
Ransom knew it would

02:18.877 --> 02:20.444
bum me out.
Come on, sooner we leave,

02:20.444 --> 02:22.185
sooner you get in
your all-important portal time.

02:22.185 --> 02:24.448
Do you think
there'll be tachyons?

02:24.448 --> 02:26.885
I can't wait to measure
some freaking tachyons!

02:35.590 --> 02:36.939
Okay, the ancient
inactive thingy

02:36.939 --> 02:38.767
is right over there.

02:38.767 --> 02:41.813
Let's go make sure
it's still not doing anything.

02:41.813 --> 02:43.163
Hey, did you know
that this portal

02:43.163 --> 02:44.816
was actually
discovered by Orions?

02:44.816 --> 02:47.819
Oh, ho, ho, Tendi, Tendi,
Tendi, Tendi.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.560
The <i>Enterprise</i>
actually found it.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.128
Ooh, ah, no, an Orion
science vessel did.

02:52.128 --> 02:53.651
My great-grandmother was on it.

02:53.651 --> 02:55.044
But, I mean,
were any Orions even

02:55.044 --> 02:57.133
doing science stuff back then?

02:57.133 --> 02:58.743
They weren't all pirates,
you know.

02:58.743 --> 03:00.310
Somebody had to make
the starships.

03:00.310 --> 03:02.225
Oh, sorry, sorry, I didn't
meant to suggest that...

03:02.225 --> 03:04.184
Look, all I'm saying is

03:04.184 --> 03:07.187
wouldn't that be a
historically-appropriate career

03:07.187 --> 03:08.275
for an Orion to have back then?

03:08.275 --> 03:10.277
Some Orions might surprise you.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.105
All right, Boims,
I know what Starfleet tells us

03:13.105 --> 03:14.629
and I know you know
everything about everything,

03:14.629 --> 03:16.239
but let's maybe
listen to Tendi on this one.

03:16.239 --> 03:17.980
Hey, guys.
You're not gonna believe this,

03:17.980 --> 03:19.677
but I'm picking
up traces of horonium.

03:19.677 --> 03:22.027
Horonium hasn't been
recorded for centuries!

03:22.027 --> 03:23.420
Oh, I can't wait to show
the guys back in Engineering

03:23.420 --> 03:25.379
this scan.
Billups is gonna flip!

03:25.379 --> 03:27.119
You know,
Starfleet used horonium

03:27.119 --> 03:28.773
in the original NX class.

03:28.773 --> 03:30.210
It's lightweight, it's durable,

03:30.210 --> 03:31.733
and it's just the right
shade of gray.

03:31.733 --> 03:34.170
Yes, yes. We were all there
for that fun time

03:34.170 --> 03:35.476
at the Starship History Museum.

03:35.476 --> 03:37.347
Ah, I bet Spock
stood right here.

03:37.347 --> 03:39.175
"Mr. Boimler,
hand me that scanner."

03:39.175 --> 03:41.525
-  That's great!
-  Is that your Spock?

03:41.525 --> 03:42.961
Yeah, I've been working on it.

03:42.961 --> 03:44.441
Old scientists.
Old starships.

03:44.441 --> 03:46.095
You know we're here,
like, right now.

03:46.095 --> 03:47.792
Maybe live in the moment?

03:47.792 --> 03:49.272
I know, but...

03:49.272 --> 03:51.056
sometimes I wish
I could have lived back then.

03:51.056 --> 03:52.406
Yeah, no, thanks.
I mean, right now

03:52.406 --> 03:54.103
when I disappoint people,
it's no big deal.

03:54.103 --> 03:55.452
But back in the past,
I'd be disappointing Uhura.

03:55.452 --> 03:57.106
Disappointing Uhura
would be cool!

03:57.106 --> 03:58.542
I wish I could disappoint Uhura.

03:58.542 --> 03:59.804
No, it wouldn't.
What are you talking about?

03:59.804 --> 04:01.328
Oh, I got to get
a picture of this.

04:01.328 --> 04:02.807
Hey Boimler, this way.
Give me a Spock pose.

04:02.807 --> 04:04.069
Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay.

04:04.069 --> 04:05.288
Live long and prosper.

04:07.421 --> 04:08.857
Uh, guys?

04:08.857 --> 04:10.815
The ancient thing
is doing a thing.

04:11.555 --> 04:14.341
Aah! Aah! Help!
The portal's

04:14.341 --> 04:16.865
- trying to portal me!
- Stop lurching towards it!

04:16.865 --> 04:18.562
- Boimler!

04:19.476 --> 04:20.521
Remember me!

04:22.697 --> 04:24.742
Boimler?

04:27.745 --> 04:28.833
Aah!

04:31.358 --> 04:33.011
What...

04:33.969 --> 04:36.276
Uh...

04:36.276 --> 04:37.886
You guys look...

04:40.105 --> 04:42.194
...very realistic.

04:42.194 --> 04:43.674
What is...

04:49.898 --> 04:51.334
Number One to <i>Enterprise.</i>

04:51.334 --> 04:55.120
We might have a problem.

04:59.429 --> 05:01.301
<i>
Space.</i>

05:02.302 --> 05:04.304
<i>The final frontier.</i>

05:06.654 --> 05:09.309
<i>These are the voyages
of the starship</i> Enterprise.

05:11.398 --> 05:14.270
<i>Its five-year mission:</i>

05:14.270 --> 05:18.448
<i>to explore strange new worlds..</i>

05:19.449 --> 05:21.973
<i>...to seek out new life</i>

05:21.973 --> 05:25.586
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

05:25.586 --> 05:29.677
<i>to boldly go
where no one has gone before.</i>

06:51.106 --> 06:54.152
<i>
Captain's log, stardate 2291.6.</i>

06:54.152 --> 06:56.241
<i>En route to deliver
a crucial shipment of grain</i>

06:56.241 --> 06:57.895
<i>to a colony on Setlik II,</i>

06:57.895 --> 07:00.202
<i>we encountered something
more pressing:</i>

07:00.202 --> 07:02.770
<i>a time traveler.</i>

07:02.770 --> 07:04.902
Mr. Spock ran an analysis
of his delta.

07:04.902 --> 07:06.556
It's not just a badge.
It's also a communicator.

07:06.556 --> 07:08.036
- You just press right here.

07:08.036 --> 07:09.777
But flipping it open's
the best part.

07:09.777 --> 07:11.561
I like ours better, too.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.479
Hi. I'm Captain...

07:16.479 --> 07:18.481
- Captain Christopher Pike.
- That's me.

07:18.481 --> 07:20.091
Uh, computer, end program?

07:24.139 --> 07:26.228
Never mind. Sorry.

07:27.577 --> 07:29.187
The portal.

07:29.187 --> 07:30.537
Oh, my God, so, the...

07:31.755 --> 07:33.365
That means I'm-I'm...
Hello.

07:33.365 --> 07:34.889
That means I'm really
on the, uh...

07:34.889 --> 07:36.978
- the, uh...
- The USS <i>Enterprise.</i>

07:36.978 --> 07:40.503
Um, and... Okay, so...

07:40.503 --> 07:41.678
what's the stardate, then?

07:41.678 --> 07:43.593
2291.6.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.377
Ah.

07:45.377 --> 07:47.597
Yes.
Five digits.

07:47.597 --> 07:49.599
Totally normal date
to be living in.

07:49.599 --> 07:51.122
We already know
you're from the future,

07:51.122 --> 07:52.950
so no need to do
what... whatever it was

07:52.950 --> 07:54.517
- you were trying to do.
- Okay, thank God.

07:54.517 --> 07:55.953
Because I'm seriously
freaking out right now.

07:55.953 --> 07:57.694
I mean, I can't believe
that I'm here.

07:57.694 --> 07:59.914
Exactly how far in the future
do you hail from, Ensign?

07:59.914 --> 08:02.351
Maybe 120 years, give or take?

08:02.351 --> 08:04.527
Well, you don't look
a day over 100.

08:07.008 --> 08:09.140
Wha... Funny captain?
What's happening?

08:09.140 --> 08:11.012
You should hold on to this.

08:11.012 --> 08:13.275
Don't want you accidentally
affecting the timeline

08:13.275 --> 08:14.450
before we get the chance
to send you...

08:14.450 --> 08:15.451
- home.

08:15.451 --> 08:17.061
This is my Number One,

08:17.061 --> 08:18.149
Lieutenant Commander
Una Chin-Riley.

08:18.149 --> 08:19.803
Nice to meet you.

08:19.803 --> 08:21.892
- Mm-hmm.
And this is
La'An Noonien-Singh,

08:21.892 --> 08:22.937
our head of security.

08:22.937 --> 08:24.895
If you'll follow me, Ensign.

08:27.202 --> 08:29.204
- That was weird.

08:29.204 --> 08:31.206
- Hmm.

08:31.206 --> 08:34.252
You don't think
he knows something...

08:34.252 --> 08:37.081
about my future, do you?

08:37.081 --> 08:38.953
No. I'm sure he's just, um...

08:40.868 --> 08:42.347
Huh.

08:42.347 --> 08:45.437
Oh! It's a classic
S/COMS operating system.

08:45.437 --> 08:46.830
Don't touch the buttons.

08:46.830 --> 08:49.006
- Nope. No, I wasn't, no.
- Look, I recognize

08:49.006 --> 08:51.139
this future knowledge
is so boring

08:51.139 --> 08:53.054
the chances of it
changing history are low,

08:53.054 --> 08:55.752
but let's review
temporal protocols regardless,

08:55.752 --> 08:57.188
- okay?
- Mm-hmm.

08:57.188 --> 08:59.582
One, no interfering

08:59.582 --> 09:02.019
- with past events.
- Got it.

09:02.019 --> 09:04.587
- Two, no sharing... future.
- No sharing knowledge
of the future.

09:04.587 --> 09:06.502
- Yes.
- Definitely won't happen again.

09:06.502 --> 09:07.503
Worf's honor.

09:07.503 --> 09:09.636
Dang it.

09:09.636 --> 09:12.421
Last, and perhaps
most important.

09:12.421 --> 09:14.249
Don't make any attachments.

09:14.249 --> 09:17.208
Uh, I'm actually not familiar
with that one.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.688
Is that a recent addition?

09:18.688 --> 09:20.429
Well, yeah, no,
because it-it's advice

09:20.429 --> 09:23.214
from personal experience.

09:23.214 --> 09:25.390
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
does-does that mean, uh...

09:26.740 --> 09:28.698
...you've time traveled too?

09:28.698 --> 09:31.396
A small change here,
we won't feel anything.

09:33.224 --> 09:34.922
Yet it could
destroy your future.

09:34.922 --> 09:37.925
Your friends.
Loved ones.

09:40.971 --> 09:44.714
<i>
Ensign's log, stardate, uh...</i>

09:44.714 --> 09:46.934
<i>the past. So...</i>

09:46.934 --> 09:49.632
I'm waiting.

09:49.632 --> 09:52.374
Not really sure
what I'm supposed to be doing.

09:52.374 --> 09:53.854
Oh, my God.

09:55.290 --> 09:57.509
Um, okay, touching this
can't possibly

09:57.509 --> 09:59.686
change the future, right?

10:02.689 --> 10:03.646
Whoa.

10:03.646 --> 10:05.866
Riker.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.347
- What are you doing?
- Uh,

10:09.347 --> 10:12.612
noth... Just, uh, you know,
it's a historical saddle,

10:12.612 --> 10:15.658
so I'm just, um,
appraising it, um... Yeah.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.704
Right.
Uh, no judgment.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.836
I just need this place to work.

10:19.836 --> 10:22.796
- So...
- Wait a minute,
are-are you, uh...

10:22.796 --> 10:24.319
are you Uhura?

10:24.319 --> 10:25.755
- Yes.
- Oh, my...

10:25.755 --> 10:27.931
This... I'm sorry,
my friend Mariner

10:27.931 --> 10:29.454
would be freaking out right now.

10:29.454 --> 10:32.588
Okay, that's... very weird

10:32.588 --> 10:35.069
and I would love to unpack that,
but I have

10:35.069 --> 10:37.680
an entire ancient language
to decipher.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.900
- So, if you don't mind.
- Wow.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.510
You are so work-focused.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.077
- Should I not be work-focused?
- You know what,

10:43.077 --> 10:44.426
- forget-forget I said anything.

10:44.426 --> 10:45.993
<i>LA'AN:
Ensign Boimler, ready to</i>

10:45.993 --> 10:47.472
<i>beam you down to the planet.
Report to</i>

10:47.472 --> 10:48.735
<i>the transporter immediately.</i>

10:48.735 --> 10:51.433
Mr. Boimler,
I cannot help but notice

10:51.433 --> 10:52.826
that you keep staring at us.

10:52.826 --> 10:56.177
Sorry, uh, it's just that, um...

10:56.177 --> 10:59.136
you're Spock.
And M'Benga.

10:59.136 --> 11:01.965
And is that
a classic TS 122 tricorder?

11:01.965 --> 11:03.619
- It's a 120.
- Do you mind if...

11:03.619 --> 11:04.838
Can-can I hold it?
Just...

11:04.838 --> 11:07.405
Thank you so much.
Oh, my God.

11:07.405 --> 11:08.929
They never improved on these.

11:08.929 --> 11:10.582
I mean, yeah, they got smaller
and more powerful

11:10.582 --> 11:12.759
and arguably less likely
to explode, but design-wise?

11:12.759 --> 11:14.412
Explode, you said?

11:14.412 --> 11:16.501
As helpful as this analysis
of industrial design is,

11:16.501 --> 11:17.546
why don't you tell us
what you were doing

11:17.546 --> 11:18.895
when the portal turned on?

11:18.895 --> 11:24.161
Yeah, so I was standing,
uh, about here.

11:24.161 --> 11:26.250
And Rutherford-- he's another
ensign-- was scanning it

11:26.250 --> 11:28.035
and he found some traces

11:28.035 --> 11:30.080
- of horonium.
- Probably from here.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.517
Anyway, we took a holo-image
with our camera

11:32.517 --> 11:35.259
that emitted radioisotopes
which seemed to set it off.

11:35.259 --> 11:37.348
So, I guess it was
just dumb luck?

11:41.222 --> 11:42.876
You just, uh...

11:42.876 --> 11:44.747
you just... laughed?

11:44.747 --> 11:46.227
Yes.

11:46.227 --> 11:48.011
The thought of assigning
intelligence to chance

11:48.011 --> 11:49.796
struck me as ridiculous.

11:50.927 --> 11:52.146
Okay.

11:53.364 --> 11:55.584
Does he always laugh
or is this new?

11:55.584 --> 11:57.891
It's definitely new.

11:57.891 --> 12:00.545
<i>
Pike to Spock,
we have a situation here.</i>

12:00.545 --> 12:05.115
Unidentified ship closing in.
Prepare for transport.

12:05.115 --> 12:06.638
Landing party's back on board.

12:06.638 --> 12:07.857
Tell them to join us
on the bridge.

12:07.857 --> 12:10.338
Captain, I think this vessel

12:10.338 --> 12:12.253
might be Orion.

12:12.253 --> 12:13.428
Pirates.

12:13.428 --> 12:14.995
Yellow Alert.
Shields up.

12:14.995 --> 12:16.344
Their shields
are still down, Captain.

12:16.344 --> 12:17.345
Weapons inactive.

12:17.345 --> 12:18.781
Tactical analysis.

12:18.781 --> 12:20.696
Some Orion vessels
are specifically designed

12:20.696 --> 12:23.307
- to fool sensors.
- Perfect timing.

12:28.704 --> 12:29.966
BOIMLER [quietly]:
Oh, my God, oh, my God,

12:29.966 --> 12:31.315
oh, my God!

12:31.315 --> 12:34.579
I'm on the bridge.

12:34.579 --> 12:37.974
NCC-1701 dash...

12:37.974 --> 12:39.323
nothing.

12:39.323 --> 12:41.195
- Oh...
- What would come after the dash?

12:41.195 --> 12:43.588
Uhura, hail the Orion vessel.

12:43.588 --> 12:44.676
Oh, my God...
Mr. Boimler?

12:44.676 --> 12:45.765
Yeah? Yeah, hey.

12:47.157 --> 12:48.115
Come stand here.

12:48.115 --> 12:49.203
Yes, sir.

12:51.031 --> 12:53.207
Lieutenant Ortegas.
You're a war hero.

12:54.382 --> 12:56.819
Uh, no response to hails, sir.

12:56.819 --> 12:58.342
We're sure that's an Orion ship?

12:58.342 --> 13:00.518
Oh, that's totally
an Orion ship.

13:00.518 --> 13:02.129
Classic Scout.

13:02.129 --> 13:03.826
I built a model of one
in a bottle.

13:03.826 --> 13:06.481
It was a small ship
but a big bottle, but still.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.964
La'An, better prepare
a full torpedo spread, in case.

13:10.964 --> 13:13.140
Wait, wait, wait!
Uh, sorry.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.316
It's just, um,
I-I have reason to believe

13:15.316 --> 13:17.057
that's a science vessel.

13:17.057 --> 13:20.800
Do Orions have science vessels?

13:21.888 --> 13:23.324
- They're ignoring our hails.
Well, it's kind of

13:23.324 --> 13:25.021
considered offensive in my time

13:25.021 --> 13:27.154
to assume all Orions
are pirates.

13:27.154 --> 13:28.546
There have been multiple reports

13:28.546 --> 13:30.766
of Orion pirate activity
in this area.

13:30.766 --> 13:33.160
Uh, totally makes sense,
given the time period.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.858
But what if I

13:35.858 --> 13:37.207
happen to know...

13:37.207 --> 13:38.513
Careful.

13:38.513 --> 13:39.949
...that's a peaceful
vessel, sir.

13:41.298 --> 13:42.909
Incoming hail
from the Orion ship.

13:45.172 --> 13:47.783
- On screen, please.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.829
This is Captain Christopher
Pike, USS <i>Enterprise.</i>

13:49.829 --> 13:52.048
<i>Captain Harr Caras</i>

13:52.048 --> 13:54.659
<i>of the Orion
science vessel</i> D'Var.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.313
We initially came to this sector

13:56.313 --> 13:58.098
to aid a Federation colony.

13:58.098 --> 14:01.623
They reported several run-ins
with Orion pirate vessels?

14:01.623 --> 14:05.105
Yeah, that
is unfortunate, Captain.

14:05.105 --> 14:07.977
Orion pirates certainly give
the rest of us a bad name.

14:07.977 --> 14:09.674
<i>If that's your business,</i>

14:09.674 --> 14:11.633
what were you doing
on Krulmuth-B?

14:11.633 --> 14:13.113
Routine surveys.

14:13.113 --> 14:14.723
Captain, I'm reading
a transporter signal.

14:14.723 --> 14:16.856
The Orions have beamed up
the portal.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.728
Captain Caras, care to explain?

14:19.728 --> 14:22.731
<i>I suspect your science officer
to be mistaken, Captain.</i>

14:22.731 --> 14:25.865
I'm reading an energy spike
emanating from the Orion ship.

14:41.010 --> 14:43.708
I think I might've made
a mistake, Number One.

14:43.708 --> 14:46.407
You?
Unheard of.

14:46.407 --> 14:47.799
Okay, I deserve that.

14:47.799 --> 14:49.279
I shouldn't have listened
to the ensign.

14:49.279 --> 14:52.021
That's why we lost the portal,
it's just...

14:52.021 --> 14:54.937
rare that we have someone
on the ship who's such a...

14:54.937 --> 14:57.287
Fan?
Of you, at least.

14:57.287 --> 15:01.161
He seems
completely terrified of me.

15:01.161 --> 15:02.640
He was so excited to see me
there for a second,

15:02.640 --> 15:05.643
it felt like my future
wasn't so bad.

15:05.643 --> 15:06.949
I get that, Chris.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.298
But then he goes
and alters time.

15:08.298 --> 15:09.778
I feel like I'm trying
to stop a toddler

15:09.778 --> 15:11.171
from knocking over
the furniture.

15:13.695 --> 15:14.957
Where's Mr. Boimler now?

15:14.957 --> 15:16.916
- ♪

15:19.092 --> 15:20.136
- What you got there?
- Aah!

15:20.136 --> 15:22.791
Uh, um, hey. Nothing.

15:22.791 --> 15:25.576
Just doing some, uh...
warp field mechanics.

15:25.576 --> 15:27.274
As long as you're not...

15:27.274 --> 15:29.145
borrowing it to input
any future knowledge.

15:29.145 --> 15:31.931
No, I don't... I don't think
I did. Um, let me just, uh...

15:31.931 --> 15:33.802
Relax, I'm just
busting your chops.

15:33.802 --> 15:35.630
-  Yeah.
- But seriously, you should

15:35.630 --> 15:37.066
probably erase
whatever you just did.

15:37.066 --> 15:39.764
Aye aye, yeah.

15:39.764 --> 15:40.765
Um...

15:40.765 --> 15:42.811
So...

15:42.811 --> 15:44.987
how are you feeling?
Has the, uh,

15:44.987 --> 15:47.642
uncontrollable vomiting
come in yet?

15:47.642 --> 15:48.817
Uh, what?

15:48.817 --> 15:50.253
Oh, chroniton poisoning.

15:50.253 --> 15:51.994
It's really common.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.691
You just want to make sure
you're close to a bathroom.

15:55.128 --> 15:57.130
Okay, are you guys
both messing with me?

15:57.130 --> 15:59.741
- What's happening?
Yeah. Hey, what's
the future like?

15:59.741 --> 16:01.134
Do you have jetpacks or what?

16:01.134 --> 16:02.222
- We have jetpacks now.
- I know,

16:02.222 --> 16:03.440
but, like, smaller jetpacks.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.007
Why don't you both tell me

16:05.007 --> 16:06.748
what life is like
on the <i>Enterprise</i>?

16:06.748 --> 16:09.794
I mean, is it just, like,
nonstop excitement?

16:09.794 --> 16:12.232
Meeting all these aliens

16:12.232 --> 16:13.973
who are still actually,
you know...

16:15.278 --> 16:16.976
...alien?

16:16.976 --> 16:19.065
Guess you're pretty used
to seeing aliens in the future?

16:19.065 --> 16:20.980
Well, yeah, but...

16:20.980 --> 16:24.157
This? Right now?
This...

16:24.157 --> 16:27.595
this is the golden age
of exploration.

16:27.595 --> 16:29.597
And you guys
get to actually live it.

16:29.597 --> 16:31.729
I mean...

16:31.729 --> 16:32.904
I'm jealous.

16:32.904 --> 16:35.037
So, where's Nyota?

16:35.037 --> 16:36.212
Where do you think?
Working.

16:36.212 --> 16:37.909
Yeah, that tracks.

16:37.909 --> 16:39.433
I couldn't even get her
to come to movie night.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.565
Oh, if you're around on Friday,
you should come.

16:41.565 --> 16:42.740
- Yeah.
- Uh,

16:42.740 --> 16:44.003
is that something you're doing

16:44.003 --> 16:45.961
for Captain Pike's birthday?

16:45.961 --> 16:47.354
It's his birthday on Friday?

16:47.354 --> 16:48.659
How do you know his birthday?

16:48.659 --> 16:49.660
Well, I mean, in the future,

16:49.660 --> 16:50.879
his birthday's a holiday.

16:50.879 --> 16:53.751
Crap!
Crap. Crap.

16:53.751 --> 16:56.754
Please, please do not
tell La'An I said anything.

16:56.754 --> 16:59.279
How's throwing the captain
a party gonna ruin the future?

16:59.279 --> 17:01.324
Well, it-it could
in several ways, um...

17:01.324 --> 17:03.674
Should we throw Pike a party?

17:04.458 --> 17:06.286
I like it.
Good idea.

17:06.286 --> 17:08.810
- I will give you all
the credit for it.
- Please don't.

17:08.810 --> 17:10.942
- Please don't put
my name on anything.
- So much credit.

17:10.942 --> 17:12.988
I have to go.

17:12.988 --> 17:14.685
Watch out for those chronitons.

17:14.685 --> 17:16.426
Okay, yeah.

17:31.920 --> 17:34.009
Nurse Chapel?

17:34.009 --> 17:35.315
Nurse Chapel, hi.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.534
Um, I need to talk to you
about Spock.

17:37.534 --> 17:39.841
Spock?
Uh, what about him?

17:39.841 --> 17:42.887
Well, he's, uh,
acting different.

17:42.887 --> 17:45.412
And I'm afraid it's 'cause
I did something that broke him.

17:45.412 --> 17:47.675
Medical.

17:47.675 --> 17:49.242
Um, what do you mean,
"different"?

17:49.242 --> 17:50.852
All I know is
where I come from,

17:50.852 --> 17:53.942
he is legendary
for never smiling,

17:53.942 --> 17:56.075
laughing, definitely no joking,

17:56.075 --> 17:58.164
and that Spock goes on to do

17:58.164 --> 17:59.513
really important things that

17:59.513 --> 18:01.645
I very much need
to have not messed up.

18:01.645 --> 18:03.256
Are you really sure you should
be telling me this stuff?

18:03.256 --> 18:05.780
No, but I-I'm worried

18:05.780 --> 18:08.913
because I made Spock laugh.

18:08.913 --> 18:11.090
And I keep wondering

18:11.090 --> 18:13.701
i-is that a butterfly effect?

18:13.701 --> 18:15.529
'Cause the Spock I know
shouldn't have done that.

18:15.529 --> 18:18.488
Maybe he's just...

18:18.488 --> 18:19.533
going through a thing.

18:19.533 --> 18:21.883
You know?
Like, having fun.

18:21.883 --> 18:24.755
No, but I've read
every single book about Spock

18:24.755 --> 18:26.757
and they-they mention
his upbringing on Vulcan,

18:26.757 --> 18:29.282
his pet sehlat, his relationship
with his mom and his dad,

18:29.282 --> 18:32.241
- but nothing about a happy,
smiley, jokey guy, period.
- Just stop. Stop, stop, stop.

18:32.241 --> 18:34.200
None of this
is your fault, okay?

18:34.200 --> 18:36.115
Spock was acting like this
before you arrived.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.812
Oh, thank God.

18:37.812 --> 18:40.510
Okay, so this is what--
this is just, like, a phase?

18:40.510 --> 18:43.165
And-and he'll get over it
and back to his,

18:43.165 --> 18:45.124
like, serious, real self soon?

18:47.735 --> 18:48.997
Oh.

18:50.216 --> 18:52.131
You're the one

18:52.131 --> 18:55.090
who's been influencing him,
not me.

18:55.090 --> 18:57.179
I... I-I shouldn't
have said anything.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.528
- I-I...
- No, it's-it's...

18:59.660 --> 19:00.922
It's fine.

19:02.097 --> 19:05.231
I never assumed that I would...

19:05.231 --> 19:08.930
get to influence him
forever, anyway.

19:11.193 --> 19:12.499
Don't even want that.

19:12.499 --> 19:14.196
I...

19:15.415 --> 19:16.981
Maybe I should, uh,

19:16.981 --> 19:19.201
get off the ship sooner, b...

19:19.201 --> 19:21.290
before I, uh...

19:22.335 --> 19:24.032
Yeah.

19:28.602 --> 19:30.256
<i>
Run me through it again.</i>

19:30.256 --> 19:32.258
Respectfully, sir,
there is nothing to run through.

19:32.258 --> 19:34.608
Given a longer time frame,
I might be able

19:34.608 --> 19:36.349
to brute force a solution,
but as of now,

19:36.349 --> 19:37.828
there is no way
to track the Orions.

19:37.828 --> 19:40.266
Uh, I know how
to track the Orions.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.268
Didn't we talk about that?

19:42.268 --> 19:43.660
Yes, uh, using future knowledge,

19:43.660 --> 19:45.227
yes, I know, I shouldn't,

19:45.227 --> 19:47.795
but, um, what if I could use it

19:47.795 --> 19:49.579
and you guys just, um...

19:49.579 --> 19:51.277
don't look?

19:51.277 --> 19:54.889
That's ridiculous.
We can't just not look.

19:56.804 --> 19:58.109
Can we?

20:00.155 --> 20:02.549
We sure this is wise?

20:02.549 --> 20:04.333
No, but I'm going with it.

20:08.511 --> 20:10.165
Huh.
Future Boy did it.

20:11.819 --> 20:13.212
Just might be a second.

20:15.126 --> 20:16.867
<i>
Our top priority
is recovering that portal</i>

20:16.867 --> 20:19.130
<i>and sending Ensign Boimler
back to his time.</i>

20:19.130 --> 20:21.132
<i>
Just want to throw out there
that harming an Orion</i>

20:21.132 --> 20:22.917
<i>could alter the timeline.</i>

20:22.917 --> 20:25.049
Ensign, we were extremely clear
about mentioning any...

20:25.049 --> 20:27.487
Please, sir. One of my friends
back home is an Orion.

20:27.487 --> 20:29.315
- And you're doing it anyway.
- She's a junior science officer

20:29.315 --> 20:32.231
in Starfleet and her great-
grandmother's on the <i>D'var.</i>

20:32.231 --> 20:33.536
If we hurt them...

20:33.536 --> 20:35.016
It could erase her
from existence.

20:35.016 --> 20:36.670
Sir, there has to be
a peaceful solution.

20:36.670 --> 20:38.062
And I know diplomacy

20:38.062 --> 20:40.282
is one of your many,
many strengths.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.937
That and patience, forgiveness,

20:42.937 --> 20:44.634
benevolence...

20:44.634 --> 20:45.809
really great hair.

20:48.856 --> 20:50.901
Hail the Orions.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.036
Captain, they are charging
their warp coils.

20:55.036 --> 20:56.733
Lock phasers on their engines

20:56.733 --> 20:59.040
- but hold your fire.
- Phasers locked and holding.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.911
Time to find out
if this really is

21:00.911 --> 21:02.739
one of my greatest strengths.

21:02.739 --> 21:04.611
<i>Captain Pike.</i>

21:04.611 --> 21:07.657
<i>What a remarkable coincidence,
running into you here.</i>

21:07.657 --> 21:09.311
We tracked you, Caras.
<i>- Why?</i>

21:09.311 --> 21:11.618
We believe you may have...

21:11.618 --> 21:14.795
accidentally taken
an ancient portal.

21:14.795 --> 21:16.318
<i>We need you to put it back.</i>

21:16.318 --> 21:18.538
- Is that a threat?
- It's a request.

21:18.538 --> 21:21.497
<i>It's hard to really talk with
your weapons aimed at our ship.</i>

21:21.497 --> 21:23.151
La'An, stand down phasers.

21:23.151 --> 21:25.501
Standing down.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.155
<i>Now, this portal--</i>

21:27.155 --> 21:28.983
persuade me to return it.

21:28.983 --> 21:31.855
How would you
like to be persuaded?

21:31.855 --> 21:34.423
<i>Give us a moment.</i>

21:35.337 --> 21:36.295
Ideas.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.992
- Not you.
- Fair.

21:37.992 --> 21:40.560
Uh, can you please tell
Captain Pike that the Orions

21:40.560 --> 21:42.388
want to trade? They see it
as a sign of respect.

21:42.388 --> 21:44.390
- You know I can hear you.
I'm standing right here.
- Sorry,

21:44.390 --> 21:46.609
- I thought the span
of the room would, uh...
Captain.

21:46.609 --> 21:48.916
It appears they are
scanning our cargo hold.

21:49.873 --> 21:51.962
<i>You're carrying
an extraordinary amount</i>

21:51.962 --> 21:55.444
<i>of tritriticale grain, Captain.</i>

21:55.444 --> 21:57.751
Giving it to us
would be persuasive.

22:02.190 --> 22:04.497
You got yourself
a deal, Captain.

22:09.110 --> 22:11.678
The portal is nearly depleted
of horonium.

22:11.678 --> 22:14.681
But I calculate there is
enough left for a single trip.

22:16.639 --> 22:18.989
Uh, I know me being here

22:18.989 --> 22:20.774
wasn't ideal

22:20.774 --> 22:22.950
and potentially
reality-threatening, but

22:22.950 --> 22:25.169
meeting all of you

22:25.169 --> 22:27.911
has been one of the greatest
experiences of my life.

22:29.043 --> 22:30.000
Thank you.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.307
Well, it's been a...

22:33.917 --> 22:36.267
...unexpected day
for all of us, Ensign.

22:36.267 --> 22:38.357
But, for the sake of the future,

22:38.357 --> 22:40.228
try not to come back.

23:05.079 --> 23:07.560
Oh, hell yeah!
I did it.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.388
Mariner? What are you...
what are you doing here?

23:09.388 --> 23:11.433
- I'm saving you.
- No, no, no, no, no!
No, we only had

23:11.433 --> 23:12.826
enough for...

23:12.826 --> 23:14.567
one trip.

23:14.567 --> 23:15.655
Oh...

23:16.656 --> 23:18.092
Whoa.

23:18.092 --> 23:21.530
Wait, Boims, did I time travel?

23:21.530 --> 23:22.836
Okay, so is Uhura here?

23:22.836 --> 23:25.142
This is amazing. Wow.

23:25.142 --> 23:26.753
You guys are great.
But is she here?

23:26.753 --> 23:28.668
Oh, the uniforms!

23:28.668 --> 23:30.278
- Pike to <i>Enterprise.</i>
Whoa.

23:30.278 --> 23:32.933
Mariner, please.
- Five to beam back.

23:32.933 --> 23:35.196
Ugh, ranks on the sleeve--
I don't know about that.

23:36.197 --> 23:37.590
You see?
He has the old thingy.

23:37.590 --> 23:39.287
Oh...

23:44.684 --> 23:46.337
<i>
Captain's log, supplemental.
Our problems</i>

23:46.337 --> 23:48.035
<i>seem to have doubled.
We started our day</i>

23:48.035 --> 23:50.124
<i>with one time traveler
and now we have two,</i>

23:50.124 --> 23:52.996
<i>which is... a lot.</i>

23:53.997 --> 23:55.999
Okay, not to be ungrateful,
but if you had just waited,

23:55.999 --> 23:58.175
- like, one more second,
we wouldn't be stuck here.
- Do-do...

23:58.175 --> 24:00.047
do you know how worried I was?

24:00.047 --> 24:02.136
You disappeared in a vortex
while I was in charge.

24:02.136 --> 24:03.485
For all I knew you were dead

24:03.485 --> 24:04.486
or stuck in
a dystopian San Francisco

24:04.486 --> 24:05.835
in the middle of a riot.

24:05.835 --> 24:07.141
Have you noticed
that their references

24:07.141 --> 24:09.578
- are weirdly specific?
- Indeed.

24:09.578 --> 24:11.188
- ...the Bell Riots, Mariner.
I was...
- I'm sorry, hold up.

24:11.188 --> 24:13.060
Look, I'm gonna keep this,
like, 100% profesh,

24:13.060 --> 24:15.018
but I was thoroughly unprepared

24:15.018 --> 24:17.543
- for how hot young Spock
was going to be.

24:17.543 --> 24:20.371
- Yeah, he's full of surprises.
- Like, what?

24:20.371 --> 24:22.025
The body, the face,
the ears-- what?

24:22.025 --> 24:23.200
I realize we're all
still all reacting

24:23.200 --> 24:24.593
to the recent complication,

24:24.593 --> 24:25.986
but we also
very much need a solution.

24:25.986 --> 24:27.857
One time traveler
is a security threat.

24:27.857 --> 24:29.816
- Two is...
- A disaster.

24:29.816 --> 24:31.339
Thought you said they were cool.

24:31.339 --> 24:33.036
They are.
This is serious.

24:33.036 --> 24:34.473
Spock, what's going
on with the portal?

24:34.473 --> 24:35.865
Still functioning.
But without horonium

24:35.865 --> 24:37.693
we cannot activate it.

24:37.693 --> 24:39.347
I am afraid
Ensign Mariner depleted

24:39.347 --> 24:41.523
- the last of the supply.
-  Well, in my defense,

24:41.523 --> 24:42.916
that thing has, like...

24:42.916 --> 24:44.613
zero instructions, you know?

24:48.661 --> 24:50.532
And there is no other
source of horonium

24:50.532 --> 24:52.186
anywhere in the quadrant?

24:52.186 --> 24:54.449
None. And there hasn't been
for over a hundred years.

24:54.449 --> 24:55.798
Can we just cook some up?

24:55.798 --> 24:57.452
- Will you please just not?
- Sorry.

24:57.452 --> 24:58.932
The ensign is correct.
We could attempt

24:58.932 --> 25:00.716
to synthesize
horonium ourselves.

25:00.716 --> 25:02.762
Hot Spock agrees with me.

25:02.762 --> 25:05.155
However, we would be putting
ourselves in great danger.

25:05.155 --> 25:07.462
If it goes wrong, the blast
could take out half the ship.

25:07.462 --> 25:09.246
And there is a chance
it might not work at all.

25:09.246 --> 25:11.205
Mm, that doesn't
sound very logical.

25:11.205 --> 25:13.381
We need a second option.
- Will you please just stop?

25:13.381 --> 25:15.122
- Sorry, that's what
he sounds like.
I might have one, Chris.

25:15.122 --> 25:16.515
The ancient text on the portal.
Uhura's locked herself

25:16.515 --> 25:17.907
in her quarters,
working on a translation.

25:17.907 --> 25:19.039
Maybe she'll come up
with some answers.

25:19.039 --> 25:20.388
Great.

25:20.388 --> 25:21.998
Oh, uh, but, you know, I have

25:21.998 --> 25:24.087
linguistics experience.
Maybe I could help her.

25:25.306 --> 25:27.526
I <i>really</i> want to say no,

25:27.526 --> 25:29.832
but how much more damage
could you do at this point?

25:29.832 --> 25:31.138
So, go for it.

25:31.138 --> 25:32.922
- Linguistics experience? Really?
- No,

25:32.922 --> 25:34.184
but it's Uhura.
Don't ruin this for me.

25:34.184 --> 25:35.577
I will end your life.

25:35.577 --> 25:38.232
And Boimler
should work with Spock.

25:38.232 --> 25:39.625
Because he took an elective

25:39.625 --> 25:41.844
in material synthesis
at the Academy.

25:41.844 --> 25:43.585
- I mean, you know, for-for fun.
- Yeah.

25:43.585 --> 25:46.806
It-it's not... it's not like
Spock needs help from me.

25:46.806 --> 25:49.504
I can use the extra
pair of hands,

25:49.504 --> 25:52.507
if Mr. Boimler is not
afraid of losing one of them.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.163
What the...

25:56.163 --> 25:57.686
Spock's smiling now?

25:57.686 --> 25:58.905
Yeah, he just doesn't know how.
Just go with it.

25:58.905 --> 25:59.862
- I don't like it.
- It's terrifying.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.651
Mariner. Mariner!

26:05.651 --> 26:07.522
- What?
- Why'd you do that?

26:07.522 --> 26:10.307
Oh, okay, don't act like the
prospect of working with Spock

26:10.307 --> 26:12.440
doesn't tick off
some weird box for you.

26:12.440 --> 26:15.574
I already worked with Spock
and it didn't...

26:15.574 --> 26:17.619
go the way I wanted it to.

26:17.619 --> 26:19.186
Oh, no.
No, Boimler,

26:19.186 --> 26:21.231
don't tell me you asked him
about his sehlat.

26:21.231 --> 26:24.452
- Can you not be such a fanboy
for one second?
- No, it's just...

26:24.452 --> 26:27.411
I thought that being here
would be perfect, but...

26:27.411 --> 26:29.326
now I just don't
want to get stuck here.

26:29.326 --> 26:31.764
- Yeah. Tough to meet
your heroes, huh?
- I joined Starfleet

26:31.764 --> 26:33.853
so I could be a part of history.

26:33.853 --> 26:35.637
But if they can't find a way
to get us back home,

26:35.637 --> 26:37.160
we're gonna have to go
live somewhere off the grid

26:37.160 --> 26:38.771
where we can't
affect history at all.

26:38.771 --> 26:40.468
No, no, no, I'm not living
off the grid anywhere.

26:40.468 --> 26:42.339
I thrive on the grid.
I require grid.

26:42.339 --> 26:44.298
- Right?
- Exactly, that's what I said.

26:44.298 --> 26:46.126
What are you... Oh.

26:46.126 --> 26:48.519
Uh... hi.

26:48.519 --> 26:49.999
Uh, is something wrong?

26:49.999 --> 26:53.263
Just wondering
if everyone from the future

26:53.263 --> 26:55.352
looks at me
like they know I'm doomed.

26:55.352 --> 26:57.659
The... Oh.
Okay, so that is just Boimler.

26:57.659 --> 27:00.531
He is probably freaked out
because you're Number One.

27:00.531 --> 27:03.404
- I mean, he has a poster
of you up in his bunk.
- A poster?

27:03.404 --> 27:05.667
You mean, like...

27:05.667 --> 27:06.929
a pin-up poster?

27:06.929 --> 27:09.758
It's a poster that is pinned up.

27:09.758 --> 27:11.760
Am... Are we saying
the same thing?

27:13.675 --> 27:15.111
You know what,
I don't want to know.

27:15.111 --> 27:17.157
Okay...

27:17.157 --> 27:18.680
Uh...

27:18.680 --> 27:20.073
I don't want to know.

27:20.073 --> 27:21.640
Okay.

27:25.644 --> 27:26.949
I probably shouldn't
mention this,

27:26.949 --> 27:29.473
but I have always admired you.

27:29.473 --> 27:31.780
- Really?
- Yeah, I mean...

27:31.780 --> 27:33.652
Carefree, but also this, like,

27:33.652 --> 27:36.002
grade-A super translating
space adventurer.

27:36.002 --> 27:38.178
Uh, too much?

27:38.178 --> 27:41.442
Honestly, it's kind of weird
you even know me at all.

27:41.442 --> 27:43.357
Girl, everybody knows you.

27:43.357 --> 27:45.794
- What do they know?

27:45.794 --> 27:49.232
- Um...
- Uh, actually,
maybe don't tell me.

27:49.232 --> 27:51.539
Yeah.

27:53.019 --> 27:56.326
I mean, just that
you're good at what you do.

27:56.326 --> 27:57.719
You know, you're hard-working,

27:57.719 --> 28:00.940
unflappable, fearless
in the face of...

28:00.940 --> 28:04.073
a bunch of different aliens
that I'm not gonna name

28:04.073 --> 28:05.422
or talk about too much
'cause you don't...

28:05.422 --> 28:06.859
you haven't met them yet.

28:06.859 --> 28:07.947
And, you know,

28:07.947 --> 28:10.427
you also know how to have fun.

28:11.559 --> 28:12.865
That-that's not terrible.

28:12.865 --> 28:14.257
No.

28:15.781 --> 28:19.219
It's... it's just
a lot of pressure, you know?

28:19.219 --> 28:21.395
I mean, I'm 22,

28:21.395 --> 28:24.877
I've barely done anything
worth admiring yet.

28:24.877 --> 28:26.922
And there are days, like today,

28:26.922 --> 28:29.142
where I can't even manage
a basic translation.

28:29.142 --> 28:30.752
And, meanwhile,
Erica's all like,

28:30.752 --> 28:32.362
"You have to learn
how to have fun."

28:32.362 --> 28:34.060
But how am I
supposed to have fun

28:34.060 --> 28:38.064
when I know I have to become
this universally-known,

28:38.064 --> 28:42.895
super-translating, unflappable,
hard-working badass?

28:44.853 --> 28:47.290
All right, I think
it's time we took a break.

28:47.290 --> 28:48.727
I really don't do breaks.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.206
Yeah, I'm starting
to catch that.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.601
You know, you're the one
who could get stuck here

28:53.601 --> 28:55.168
if we don't figure
this translation out.

28:55.168 --> 28:57.431
Are you familiar
with Starfleet labor codes?

28:57.431 --> 28:58.693
Maybe.

28:58.693 --> 29:01.478
Section 48 Alpha-dash-seven:

29:01.478 --> 29:03.524
"Officers must take meal breaks
at regular intervals."

29:03.524 --> 29:05.004
I could report you.

29:05.004 --> 29:08.659
- Y-You know Starfleet codes?
- Of course.

29:08.659 --> 29:10.052
I mean, there's
a whole bunch of them that

29:10.052 --> 29:11.575
let you slack off a ton,
so, yeah. Come on.

29:11.575 --> 29:12.794
<i>All right,</i>

29:12.794 --> 29:15.710
we got some Orion hurricanes.

29:15.710 --> 29:19.279
Well, kind of. They actually
didn't have any Orion delaq,

29:19.279 --> 29:21.020
so I kind of had to improvise,

29:21.020 --> 29:23.370
which is honestly for the best.
That stuff will

29:23.370 --> 29:25.241
mess you up,
truly ruin your life.

29:25.241 --> 29:26.634
All right.

29:30.507 --> 29:31.944
Ah.

29:32.945 --> 29:34.076
I like you.

29:34.076 --> 29:36.078
You're a good bad influence.

29:36.078 --> 29:37.166
If you're still around,
you should

29:37.166 --> 29:38.733
come to Pike's surprise party.

29:38.733 --> 29:40.343
Cool. But only if I can
take a bunch of pictures

29:40.343 --> 29:42.128
and weird my mom out
with a history book.

29:43.303 --> 29:45.131
I'm joking.
Sort of.

29:48.221 --> 29:50.527
Oh, I knew it was
too good to be true.

29:51.572 --> 29:54.009
Why is everyone obsessed
with me taking breaks? This...

29:54.009 --> 29:55.532
this isn't the time.

29:56.577 --> 29:58.187
On the Klingon front

29:58.187 --> 30:00.581
you never knew
when you'd get rest.

30:00.581 --> 30:02.235
So, you'd take a break
when you could

30:02.235 --> 30:03.845
'cause you'd never
get that time back.

30:03.845 --> 30:06.108
Work will still be here
in five minutes.

30:07.327 --> 30:08.807
Fine. Fine.

30:09.938 --> 30:11.810
Let's relax.

30:15.901 --> 30:18.425
Ooh, easy, that's a lot of...

30:18.425 --> 30:20.514
I've seen these.

30:22.995 --> 30:24.605
Wait, you-you know
these symbols?

30:24.605 --> 30:26.128
I've seen them before.

30:26.128 --> 30:27.564
At Starbase Earhart.

30:27.564 --> 30:29.305
A guy tried to trade me
a dom-jot set.

30:29.305 --> 30:31.742
- What's dom-jot?
Oh, uh,

30:31.742 --> 30:33.919
it's this billiard game
that Nausicaans are terrible at,

30:33.919 --> 30:35.529
yet love to bet on
for some reason.

30:35.529 --> 30:38.575
This wasn't a traditional set,
it was old.

30:38.575 --> 30:40.751
Ancient old.

30:40.751 --> 30:42.579
Nausicaans...

30:42.579 --> 30:44.668
Wait, give me a second.

30:45.887 --> 30:47.019
Erica, you're brilliant.

30:47.019 --> 30:49.978
This is true, I am.
Why?

30:49.978 --> 30:52.981
The glyphs on the portal
are an ancient Nausicaan dialect

30:52.981 --> 30:56.115
that's thousands of years old.

30:56.115 --> 30:58.900
- That's why I didn't
recognize it before.
Oh.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.336
That's why.

31:00.336 --> 31:02.599
Not, you know,
taking five to recharge.

31:03.557 --> 31:04.775
Unbelievable.

31:05.820 --> 31:07.343
Ensign Boimler, Nurse Chapel

31:07.343 --> 31:10.172
- told me about your exchange.
- She did?

31:10.172 --> 31:12.653
She did not go into detail,
but it was easy to extrapolate

31:12.653 --> 31:15.003
that there was something
you told her about my future.

31:15.003 --> 31:17.005
- Perhaps I should know?
- Nah.

31:17.005 --> 31:19.703
Nah, nothing from me
on the old, uh...

31:19.703 --> 31:21.314
future-altering front.

31:21.314 --> 31:23.577
It does not take an expert
observer to recognize

31:23.577 --> 31:26.058
that my experiments
in human emotion trouble you.

31:26.058 --> 31:28.712
Therefore, I must surmise
that my future state--

31:28.712 --> 31:30.279
the one you are familiar with--

31:30.279 --> 31:32.325
must be one in which
my emotions are minimized.

31:32.325 --> 31:34.109
Must you surmise that?

31:34.109 --> 31:36.720
But you did say something
to Christine that upset her.

31:37.765 --> 31:39.419
Look, all I said

31:39.419 --> 31:42.378
was that I'm surprised
that you're so...

31:42.378 --> 31:43.771
human.

31:43.771 --> 31:48.994
Yes, the universe
needs Vulcan Spock,

31:48.994 --> 31:52.301
if everything that I know
happens... happens.

31:52.301 --> 31:54.564
And yet I have no choice
but to stay true

31:54.564 --> 31:56.305
to the path I have chosen
in this time.

31:56.305 --> 31:58.307
If you sway me then my future
will have been altered.

31:58.307 --> 32:00.179
Is that not logical?

32:01.528 --> 32:02.921
Unfortunately, it is.

32:04.661 --> 32:06.968
Shall we activate
the synthesizer?

32:06.968 --> 32:10.276
Sure, I mean, is-is it gonna,
uh, blow my hand off?

32:10.276 --> 32:13.670
- We are separating fissile
isotopes at high speeds.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.977
The chance of an explosion
is down to a coin flip.

32:17.631 --> 32:20.939
I find myself
curious about chance.

32:23.419 --> 32:24.986
Do you feel lucky?

32:24.986 --> 32:27.119
Uh, no, not at all.
I, um...

32:27.119 --> 32:29.643
Okay.
Uh, so...

32:31.297 --> 32:33.386
- Okay, is that bad?
Are sparks bad?
- Yes.

32:33.386 --> 32:34.778
Seek cover.

32:38.782 --> 32:40.175
Aah!

32:49.924 --> 32:51.970
I've ruined everything.

32:54.233 --> 32:55.451
Oh, my dear,

32:55.451 --> 32:57.976
there is nothing
quite so soothing

32:57.976 --> 33:01.066
as a properly-calibrated
warp core.

33:03.024 --> 33:04.721
You're one of those future kids.

33:04.721 --> 33:07.159
Was. Um...

33:07.159 --> 33:10.771
Now I'm one of those,
uh, stuck-here kids.

33:10.771 --> 33:12.991
Also, I'm a man.

33:14.035 --> 33:17.038
You don't happen to know about
Setlik II-- did we, uh,

33:17.038 --> 33:20.215
find more grain
for the colonists there?

33:20.215 --> 33:23.044
"More" was never on the table.
That's all anyone had.

33:23.044 --> 33:26.700
It was specially made
to grow in their biome.

33:26.700 --> 33:30.008
- So, now we'll just try and...
- You're relocating them.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.835
But they've been there
for generations.

33:31.835 --> 33:35.230
There has to be
something else we can do.

33:35.230 --> 33:38.494
Yes. Find a time travel device

33:38.494 --> 33:40.496
and use it to stop yourself

33:40.496 --> 33:42.498
from messing everything up!

33:42.498 --> 33:45.327
Thank you.
That's helpful.

33:48.069 --> 33:51.507
I look up to everyone
on this ship, but...

33:53.031 --> 33:55.381
...turns out
I don't belong here.

33:55.381 --> 33:58.123
I mean, how can I fix
everything that I...

33:58.123 --> 34:00.734
that I screwed up?

34:00.734 --> 34:03.519
I'm a Lanthanite.

34:03.519 --> 34:06.044
I've lived
for thousands of years.

34:07.567 --> 34:09.395
Most heroes I've seen...

34:10.613 --> 34:13.268
...are just pretending
half the time.

34:13.268 --> 34:16.619
Mm.
There's this one guy I remember.

34:16.619 --> 34:18.795
He said to me,

34:18.795 --> 34:21.276
"I always pretended

34:21.276 --> 34:25.150
"to be someone I wanted to be

34:25.150 --> 34:28.066
"until finally

34:28.066 --> 34:30.024
"I became

34:30.024 --> 34:32.635
"that someone...

34:32.635 --> 34:35.073
or he became me."

34:53.700 --> 34:55.919
Okay, okay, um...

34:55.919 --> 34:57.747
all right.

34:57.747 --> 34:59.314
- Ah.
- Whoa!

34:59.314 --> 35:00.750
- Holy Q!
- Don't!

35:00.750 --> 35:02.796
Don't yell Q!
They haven't met him yet.

35:02.796 --> 35:04.537
They had kind of
a Trelane thing going on.

35:04.537 --> 35:06.104
- What are you doing?
- What are <i>you</i> doing?

35:06.104 --> 35:07.235
Are you stealing a shuttle?

35:07.235 --> 35:08.497
I'm not st...
Oh, fudge.

35:10.804 --> 35:12.371
What happened to your
new best friend Uhura?

35:12.371 --> 35:14.242
Oh, Uhura's awesome.

35:14.242 --> 35:16.810
Yeah, but the, uh,
the translation was a bust.

35:16.810 --> 35:18.638
- Wait, she couldn't crack it?
- No, she could.

35:18.638 --> 35:20.335
Thank you.
Problem is all it said was

35:20.335 --> 35:22.642
-"This is a time portal."
- Crap.

35:22.642 --> 35:25.035
- Yeah.
- This era's weird.

35:25.035 --> 35:26.559
I know. Have you noticed
how slow everybody talks?

35:26.559 --> 35:27.864
- Yeah, and quietly.
- Yeah.

35:27.864 --> 35:29.431
So, what's with the shuttle?

35:29.431 --> 35:31.085
Well, ever since I've got here,
all I've done

35:31.085 --> 35:33.522
is open my big, stupid mouth
and screw everything up,

35:33.522 --> 35:36.046
but if I want to be a hero,
I have to fix things.

35:36.046 --> 35:37.352
Ooh, what are we fixing?

35:37.352 --> 35:38.614
The Orions took grain
in exchange

35:38.614 --> 35:40.050
for the portal, so I figured

35:40.050 --> 35:42.488
if we're gonna
be stuck here anyway,

35:42.488 --> 35:44.142
might as well trade it back

35:44.142 --> 35:45.969
and give that food
to people who really need it.

35:45.969 --> 35:47.928
Doesn't that thing need to be
on Crumhat-D in the future?

35:47.928 --> 35:49.408
- Krulmuth-B.
- Whatever.

35:49.408 --> 35:52.106
And I'm... done

35:52.106 --> 35:53.673
worrying about the future.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.372
I want to help people now.

35:59.287 --> 36:01.202
And the shuttle has a separate
communications array.

36:01.202 --> 36:03.857
Easier to bypass security,
get a message to the Orions.

36:03.857 --> 36:05.946
- All right, sneaky Boimy.

36:05.946 --> 36:07.730
I like it.

36:07.730 --> 36:09.079
But you're not good
at breaking protocol.

36:09.079 --> 36:10.080
You're gonna need an accomplice.

36:10.080 --> 36:11.908
And I never get caught.

36:11.908 --> 36:13.649
- LA'AN: What are you doing?
- Oh! Oh, no.

36:13.649 --> 36:15.390
Sorry, sorry.

36:16.913 --> 36:18.219
Hi.

36:23.093 --> 36:25.183
You're lucky Uhura likes
to monitor local comm traffic

36:25.183 --> 36:28.186
and was able to block
your signal. Over there.

36:29.230 --> 36:32.059
It could have easily
escalated to a bad place.

36:32.059 --> 36:33.887
I'm having you both
confined to quarters

36:33.887 --> 36:36.019
until we reach Starbase One.
Then you'll be their problem.

36:36.019 --> 36:39.240
Lieutenant, I'd like a moment
alone with them both, please.

36:39.240 --> 36:40.415
Sir.

36:43.505 --> 36:46.073
- Mr. Boimler.

36:46.073 --> 36:48.249
For a guy who seems like
a rule-follower,

36:48.249 --> 36:49.555
you certainly break
a lot of them.

36:49.555 --> 36:51.121
And Ms. Mariner.

36:51.121 --> 36:54.342
I thought you were here
to save your friend,

36:54.342 --> 36:55.648
not make his situation worse.

36:55.648 --> 36:58.955
Look, it was all me, okay?
I just...

36:58.955 --> 37:00.609
I don't think Boimler can handle
getting thrown in the brig

37:00.609 --> 37:02.611
by a guy who he dressed up as
for Halloween.

37:02.611 --> 37:05.048
Oh, he...
Really?

37:05.048 --> 37:06.876
Yeah, he had to contour the hell
out of the jawline, too.

37:06.876 --> 37:08.008
It-it was a process, yeah.

37:09.879 --> 37:11.881
Look.

37:11.881 --> 37:14.275
I want to ask you both

37:14.275 --> 37:16.103
for a personal favor.

37:16.103 --> 37:18.323
Mr. Boimler.

37:18.323 --> 37:20.586
I heard that you've been
encouraging my crew

37:20.586 --> 37:22.283
to throw me a surprise party.

37:22.283 --> 37:24.154
Please stop doing that.

37:24.154 --> 37:26.679
It's just...

37:26.679 --> 37:29.769
you never know how
many birthdays you have left,

37:29.769 --> 37:31.249
-  What are you doing?
- and-and...

37:31.249 --> 37:33.033
right now, you have friends

37:33.033 --> 37:35.514
who want to celebrate you.

37:35.514 --> 37:37.429
While you still can.

37:37.429 --> 37:40.040
Ah.

37:40.040 --> 37:42.303
Think I know what you're
getting at. And I already know.

37:42.303 --> 37:45.306
- Uh, you know about...
- You... So, you know
about the whole...

37:45.306 --> 37:47.047
- What specifically
do you know about?
- Not wanting a party

37:47.047 --> 37:48.614
has nothing to do with
what's going to happen to me.

37:48.614 --> 37:50.311
It's about

37:50.311 --> 37:52.139
what's already happened.

37:54.010 --> 37:55.360
What do you mean?

37:55.360 --> 37:58.711
My father--

37:58.711 --> 38:00.800
we didn't get along.

38:00.800 --> 38:03.716
Frankly, there were times
I downright hated his guts.

38:05.239 --> 38:08.416
We never resolved things.

38:10.244 --> 38:11.941
This is the first year

38:11.941 --> 38:14.161
I'll be older than he was
when he died.

38:14.161 --> 38:16.816
But I'd give years

38:16.816 --> 38:18.208
off my own life

38:18.208 --> 38:20.907
if we could have
one more argument.

38:20.907 --> 38:22.648
So,

38:22.648 --> 38:25.651
my plan was
to finish this mission

38:25.651 --> 38:29.524
then sit in a fishing cabin
on Setlik II's ice moon,

38:29.524 --> 38:32.571
bring a good bottle of whiskey
and have that talk.

38:32.571 --> 38:34.703
I'm sorry about your dad.

38:34.703 --> 38:36.836
But I wonder...

38:36.836 --> 38:40.492
if, someday,
you're not around anymore,

38:40.492 --> 38:42.537
how many people on this ship

38:42.537 --> 38:45.018
would wish they had another day
to talk to you?

38:49.022 --> 38:51.067
Sometimes it's hard
to visit the past.

38:51.067 --> 38:54.244
- Yeah, I mean, I didn't
want to be here at all.
- Shh. This...

38:58.336 --> 38:59.467
You know...

39:02.122 --> 39:05.430
I can understand
what it must feel like--

39:05.430 --> 39:07.388
the both of you coming here.

39:08.389 --> 39:10.391
I try to think how I would feel

39:10.391 --> 39:12.350
setting foot
on Archer's <i>Enterprise.</i>

39:12.350 --> 39:14.308
Oh, the NX-01?
Don't worry,

39:14.308 --> 39:16.223
Boimler would freak out
about that, too.

39:16.223 --> 39:17.833
The NX-01.

39:17.833 --> 39:19.269
They don't make them
like that ship anymore, huh?

39:19.269 --> 39:22.490
No, they do.

39:22.490 --> 39:24.231
Captain...

39:24.231 --> 39:26.102
I think I know
how to get us home.

39:31.499 --> 39:33.762
When I first arrived,
I brought expectations

39:33.762 --> 39:35.416
of each of you from the future.

39:35.416 --> 39:37.200
And not only was that dangerous,

39:37.200 --> 39:40.465
it denied the reality
of who you are right now.

39:40.465 --> 39:42.380
So, I'd like to apologize
to you all

39:42.380 --> 39:44.425
- with a limerick.
Or you could just

39:44.425 --> 39:46.427
- get to the point.
I don't have to
do the limerick.

39:46.427 --> 39:48.124
I don't have to...
Mariner, why don't you...

39:48.124 --> 39:49.561
Okay, so, one time,
Boimler dragged me

39:49.561 --> 39:50.779
to the Starship History Museum.

39:50.779 --> 39:52.259
Dragged?
You ran up to the doors.

39:52.259 --> 39:53.347
No, I didn't.
It was boring. I hated it.

39:53.347 --> 39:54.957
Anyway, um, so,

39:54.957 --> 39:57.395
they had the NX-01 there.
Archer's <i>Enterprise.</i>

39:57.395 --> 39:59.745
Yeah, yeah, classic design.
Plus it had, you know,

39:59.745 --> 40:01.224
- the grapplers.
- Skip that part.
They don't care.

40:01.224 --> 40:03.183
- I love grapplers.
- See?

40:03.183 --> 40:05.011
- All right.
- Anyway,

40:05.011 --> 40:06.752
later on in the tour,
they said that

40:06.752 --> 40:09.537
ships back then
actually used horonium alloy

40:09.537 --> 40:10.538
in their hulls.

40:10.538 --> 40:12.540
Ta-da!

40:13.715 --> 40:16.326
So we need to dig an NX class
ship out of mothballs?

40:16.326 --> 40:17.850
No, because the tradition is

40:17.850 --> 40:19.329
every time
a new vessel's commissioned...

40:19.329 --> 40:20.461
Construction starts with a piece

40:20.461 --> 40:21.680
of the last ship
to bear its name.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.290
Meaning there should be

40:23.290 --> 40:25.161
a piece of horonium
inside the <i>Enterprise.</i>

40:25.161 --> 40:27.250
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.
Do you know where

40:27.250 --> 40:29.165
the section is located?

40:29.165 --> 40:32.473
- I don't, but...
- Surprise, I paid attention.

40:32.473 --> 40:34.127
Without being asked.

40:34.127 --> 40:35.824
This guy was distracted
by the grapplers.

40:35.824 --> 40:37.391
It is surprising

40:37.391 --> 40:38.784
because she normally
does not pay attention.

40:44.964 --> 40:48.489
Oh, careful with my floor.
I use that!

40:48.489 --> 40:51.579
It is illogical to assume
that you are the only one.

40:51.579 --> 40:53.320
One, two.
I can't believe

40:53.320 --> 40:55.322
all this time,
we have been walking

40:55.322 --> 40:57.019
over a piece of history.

40:57.019 --> 40:58.934
I'm a huge fan
of Travis Mayweather.

40:58.934 --> 41:01.633
First pilot of the NX-01.

41:01.633 --> 41:04.244
My middle school gym
was named after him.

41:04.244 --> 41:05.898
Hoshi Sato was
on that ship, too.

41:05.898 --> 41:08.422
You know she spoke 86 languages?

41:08.422 --> 41:10.511
I wrote three papers
on her at the Academy.

41:12.731 --> 41:14.515
Are we sounding like...

41:14.515 --> 41:16.561
Them?

41:16.561 --> 41:17.649
Indeed.

41:17.649 --> 41:20.521
It is exhausting.

41:26.396 --> 41:27.963
Hi.

41:27.963 --> 41:29.922
Is there a problem, Ensign?

41:29.922 --> 41:32.141
Listen, I-I may have given you
the wrong impression

41:32.141 --> 41:35.623
about Boimler's poster.
It-it's for recruitment.

41:35.623 --> 41:37.146
Yeah, you're the literal

41:37.146 --> 41:40.367
poster girl/woman for Starfleet.

41:41.673 --> 41:43.326
- Come on, come on.
- Uh...

41:43.326 --> 41:46.112
- You should have led
with that part.
- Yeah.

41:46.112 --> 41:47.766
- This is true?
Uh, yes, sir,

41:47.766 --> 41:49.985
Number One, sir. Uh...

41:49.985 --> 41:53.685
It was a really big reason
why I joined.

41:53.685 --> 41:55.774
<i>Ad astra per aspera.</i>

41:58.516 --> 42:00.039
They put that on the poster?

42:01.214 --> 42:02.955
And I put it in my bunk.

42:04.304 --> 42:07.046
I meant for that to sound
a lot more admiring than it did.

42:08.090 --> 42:09.962
Your flagrant disregard
for temporal protocols

42:09.962 --> 42:12.094
by telling me this
is deeply troubling.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.405
But thanks, all the same.

42:30.896 --> 42:33.507
Live long and prosper,
Mr. Boimler.

42:39.687 --> 42:40.819
Energize.

42:40.819 --> 42:43.909
I-I'll...
You also live and...

42:49.305 --> 42:52.004
We got your message
about the portal.

42:52.004 --> 42:53.614
That was a mistake.

42:53.614 --> 42:56.486
That message was sent
without my authorization.

42:56.486 --> 42:57.923
I'm afraid we still need it.

42:57.923 --> 43:00.273
I do not like
having my time wasted,

43:00.273 --> 43:02.144
- Captain.
- It's not his fault.

43:02.144 --> 43:04.233
- It's mine.
- And mine.
- LA'AN: It's true.

43:04.233 --> 43:05.495
It's their fault.

43:05.495 --> 43:07.193
We called you because

43:07.193 --> 43:08.890
we didn't want those
Federation colonists to starve.

43:08.890 --> 43:10.413
Yeah, plus we were
kind of going through

43:10.413 --> 43:11.545
a quarter-life crisis
type of thing.

43:11.545 --> 43:13.286
You know, you meet your heroes,

43:13.286 --> 43:14.940
and then you're like,
"What have I done with my life?

43:14.940 --> 43:16.550
- I'm trash, right?"
- You went through that, too?

43:16.550 --> 43:18.813
Absolutely. You met Uhura.
She's the total package.

43:18.813 --> 43:20.685
- It is intimidating.
Because I was going
through the same thing

43:20.685 --> 43:21.990
- with Spock, so...
- I know. I didn't want to...
- Earlier,

43:21.990 --> 43:23.644
you will recall, I told you that

43:23.644 --> 43:25.124
we were here
for routine surveys.

43:25.124 --> 43:27.430
Well, here's the whole truth.

43:27.430 --> 43:29.998
That is a time portal.

43:29.998 --> 43:33.262
And these two
are from the future, and...

43:33.262 --> 43:36.439
- we need the portal
to get them home.
- Really?

43:36.439 --> 43:39.529
To a future where
it's considered offensive

43:39.529 --> 43:41.444
to assume an Orion is a pirate.

43:41.444 --> 43:43.795
Yeah. And, actually,
you know, one of our

43:43.795 --> 43:46.232
best friends in Starfleet
is an Orion officer.

43:46.232 --> 43:48.669
A scientist.
Although she does also

43:48.669 --> 43:51.324
go by the name Mistress
of the Winter Constellations.

43:51.324 --> 43:52.934
- It's very strange.
- That name.

43:52.934 --> 43:55.197
Her great-grandmother's
on your ship.

43:55.197 --> 43:56.546
Her name's Tendi.

43:56.546 --> 43:58.548
I have an Astrea Tendi
on my ship.

43:58.548 --> 44:00.115
How do you know that?

44:00.115 --> 44:01.900
- Well... Yeah.
- Because we are time travelers,

44:01.900 --> 44:03.597
as we've been telling you.
I feel like he doesn't listen.

44:03.597 --> 44:04.990
How-how about this.

44:04.990 --> 44:06.426
You let us use the portal

44:06.426 --> 44:10.299
and as far as history
is concerned,

44:10.299 --> 44:12.040
Orions discovered it.

44:12.040 --> 44:14.913
Orion scientists.

44:18.743 --> 44:20.832
That's all I've ever wanted.

44:36.848 --> 44:38.414
There they are!
Should we go get them?

44:38.414 --> 44:40.025
Hang on! We'll be right there!

44:40.025 --> 44:42.157
- Oh, no, no, no,
we'll come to you.
- Just, no.

44:48.120 --> 44:50.209
It was good
to meet you, Captain.

45:08.140 --> 45:09.968
Wha...

45:09.968 --> 45:11.534
They seemed nice.

45:11.534 --> 45:13.623
Tendi, you were right.

45:13.623 --> 45:15.713
It turns out Orions
did discover this portal.

45:15.713 --> 45:17.932
I know. I told you. My great-
grandmother discovered it.

45:17.932 --> 45:19.891
- Ooh, Astrea, right?
- That's right.

45:19.891 --> 45:22.023
But how'd you know her name?

45:25.244 --> 45:27.942
Thanks for coming back
to the T.O.S. era to get me.

45:27.942 --> 45:29.074
You picked that up from Ransom.

45:29.074 --> 45:30.466
Why does he always call it that?

45:30.466 --> 45:32.033
It stands for
Those Old Scientists.

45:32.033 --> 45:33.774
- Huh. They seemed
pretty young to me.
- Oh!

45:33.774 --> 45:35.210
Numero Una.

45:35.210 --> 45:36.908
Hottest First Officer

45:36.908 --> 45:38.779
- in Starfleet history.
- Ow!

45:38.779 --> 45:40.520
Hey, hey! How was
the mission, Mariner?

45:40.520 --> 45:42.348
Never seen you fight
to get work before.

45:42.348 --> 45:44.306
Captain was just gonna
send cadets to that portal,

45:44.306 --> 45:45.351
but she called dibs.

45:45.351 --> 45:47.440
It was boring.
Go away.

45:47.440 --> 45:50.008
You fought to get this mission?

45:50.008 --> 45:51.966
- You did it
just so I'd get to go.
- No.

45:51.966 --> 45:54.186
Ransom's just an idiot
with a bad memory

45:54.186 --> 45:56.188
'cause he sleeps facedown
like a baby. Shut up.

45:56.188 --> 45:57.537
Huh.

46:10.768 --> 46:14.075
When we shouted "Surprise!"
you didn't seem very surprised.

46:14.075 --> 46:15.773
Come on, Number One.
I knew.

46:15.773 --> 46:17.470
That's why I cancelled
my fishing trip.

46:17.470 --> 46:18.776
Someone reminded me that maybe

46:18.776 --> 46:20.081
I should celebrate
with my friends.

46:20.081 --> 46:22.127
Okay, next month
for movie night,

46:22.127 --> 46:24.346
I'm programming
an Andorian comedy.

46:24.346 --> 46:26.740
Mm-hmm. Turns out the secret
to getting Uhura to relax

46:26.740 --> 46:28.611
is making it feel like work.

46:28.611 --> 46:31.136
I believe you are going to be
her next project, Lieutenant.

46:31.136 --> 46:32.964
God help me.

46:32.964 --> 46:35.531
Mm, what exactly have we been
drinking for the last hour?

46:35.531 --> 46:37.403
Orion hurricanes.

46:37.403 --> 46:40.188
Caras gave us a bottle
of real Orion delaq,

46:40.188 --> 46:41.537
so they're genuine.

46:41.537 --> 46:43.322
Interesting flavor.

46:43.322 --> 46:45.324
Does anyone else feel strange?

46:45.324 --> 46:47.979
Why does everything feel
so... two-dimensional?

46:47.979 --> 46:50.111
My arms don't normally do this.

46:50.111 --> 46:52.853
My eyes feel huge.
Do my eyes look huge?

46:52.853 --> 46:55.160
Hmm... Hmm?

46:55.160 --> 46:57.771
What the hell
is in these things?!
