WEBVTT

00:01.930 --> 00:05.513
All right, rise and shine!
Let's go, shit-wit!

00:05.684 --> 00:08.353
- Help! What's going on?
- Blood test come back positive for TB.

00:08.478 --> 00:10.720
T... How in the hell did I get TB?

00:10.856 --> 00:12.433
Do I look like a doctor?

00:12.566 --> 00:17.192
You got to go to the infirmary for quarantine
till the tests come back clear. Let's go!

00:17.362 --> 00:20.447
Well, check my forehead.
That feel hot to you?

00:21.116 --> 00:22.112
Open it up!

00:22.659 --> 00:25.909
God damn it, Raylan!
I thought I was really sick.

00:26.038 --> 00:28.196
Do you even know what TB is?

00:28.332 --> 00:31.036
Well, all the masks and shit, I thought
it was some kind of monkey virus,

00:31.168 --> 00:32.164
like in that movie.

00:32.293 --> 00:33.753
We pulled you out for quarantine

00:33.879 --> 00:35.788
so we can talk
without you taking a shiv for it.

00:35.923 --> 00:37.465
But if you'd prefer to talk
amongst your friends...

00:37.966 --> 00:39.840
No, no, no, no. No, I'm good. I'm good.

00:39.968 --> 00:42.720
- Then what's this about?
- You got to get me out of here, Marshal.

00:42.846 --> 00:44.637
I can't deal with this kind of action.

00:45.599 --> 00:47.010
Do you know what that is?

00:47.351 --> 00:50.885
That's the world's smallest man playing <i>My
Heart Bleeds for You</i> on a tiny violin.

00:51.021 --> 00:54.022
Now, why don't you tell me
why you dragged me down here?

00:54.149 --> 00:56.189
I'll give you something good,
you think I can get early release?

00:56.318 --> 00:59.105
Well, that depends.
If you're not full of shit...

00:59.237 --> 01:01.563
- Hand to God, Marshal.
- ...and if what you have to give me

01:01.698 --> 01:02.730
is in any way useful.

01:02.866 --> 01:05.571
Well, for one thing, that town law fella

01:05.702 --> 01:07.031
- you had bring me in?
- Doyle Bennett?

01:07.537 --> 01:09.162
- He's a dirty cop, Raylan.
- No!

01:09.289 --> 01:11.863
- Straight up.
- Dewey, the way this works is,

01:13.293 --> 01:15.535
you have to tell me
something I don't know.

01:16.338 --> 01:18.829
And then we talk about
you getting into a halfway house.

01:18.966 --> 01:19.961
Okay, fine.

01:20.717 --> 01:23.802
That pretty boy molester that you all
are putting the federal boot heel to?

01:23.929 --> 01:26.218
- Jimmy Earl Dean.
- Hates you like poison.

01:26.723 --> 01:28.632
- Yeah.
- So, when he found out what I did,

01:28.767 --> 01:32.516
you know, dressing up with the hat and all,
well, we kind of formed a bond over it.

01:32.938 --> 01:35.227
What fruit did this touching
new relationship bear?

01:35.357 --> 01:38.062
Well, he says you don't know half of
what's going on down in Bennett.

01:38.193 --> 01:41.776
He says if you did, you'd eat that hat,
and he'd be the one to feed it to you.

01:43.615 --> 01:45.655
Dean was the muscle for
the Bennett weed trade?

01:45.784 --> 01:47.860
He says no, that ain't all he
was doing down there.

01:47.995 --> 01:50.367
He says that
the Bennetts are up to something big.

01:52.499 --> 01:54.492
Did he happen to mention
what that might be?

01:55.919 --> 01:59.335
Well, not as such, but he did let
on it might have something to do with

01:59.464 --> 02:00.840
the daddy of that girl he was sweet on.

02:00.966 --> 02:02.128
"Sweet on"?

02:02.259 --> 02:06.126
Is that why he tied up the 14-year-old girl
and tossed her into the trunk of his car?

02:06.263 --> 02:08.255
Told me she could pass as 16, easy.

02:08.389 --> 02:09.717
- Dewey.
- What?

02:10.809 --> 02:13.478
The girl's daddy.
What does it have to do with him?

02:13.603 --> 02:16.640
When he first came by their house,
he told 'em he was with the bank.

02:16.857 --> 02:18.481
Bank? Did he elaborate?

02:18.692 --> 02:22.476
Yeah, he did. He said, now, what'd he
say? He said he was with the bank,

02:22.821 --> 02:27.198
and then he said... It's kind of
complicated. He's with the bank.

02:27.325 --> 02:28.405
Did you get confused?

02:28.535 --> 02:30.777
Do you understand mortgages and shit?
I don't.

02:31.371 --> 02:33.079
Well, seems you're not alone there.

02:35.417 --> 02:38.418
Well, so, come on! What do I get?
That's got to be worth something.

02:38.545 --> 02:41.581
If you want to get into a halfway house,
you got to give me more than that, Dewey.

02:41.715 --> 02:46.128
Come on, now. Turn that frown around.
Hell, you give yourself a shave,

02:46.261 --> 02:48.254
I'll bet you could pass for 16.

03:23.673 --> 03:24.918
Hey, Mama.

03:25.467 --> 03:27.258
She ain't here.

03:28.553 --> 03:32.136
- What do you mean she ain't here?
- I mean she ain't here.

03:33.809 --> 03:35.848
Well, who's minding the store, then?

03:37.229 --> 03:38.474
What, you?

03:41.483 --> 03:44.982
She said she had affairs to attend to,
be back after 4:00.

03:45.112 --> 03:47.603
And I guess she just up and left
you in charge.

03:48.532 --> 03:49.777
I find that

03:52.744 --> 03:54.618
very hard to believe.

03:54.746 --> 03:57.700
Well, you're welcome to look around for
her if it'll set your mind at ease.

03:57.833 --> 03:59.493
You ain't got to get
mouthy with me, girl.

04:03.421 --> 04:09.008
Mama ain't never left me in charge.
Dickie neither. And here you sit?

04:11.304 --> 04:13.593
Well, it ain't as glamorous as it looks.

04:26.361 --> 04:27.392
Goodbye.

04:29.156 --> 04:31.729
You're supposed to leave money
for stuff you take.

04:31.950 --> 04:33.361
She told me to tell you that.

04:35.203 --> 04:36.318
Well, you know what?

04:37.164 --> 04:40.081
Now you can tell her that you told me,
can't you?

04:47.591 --> 04:49.916
I appreciate the courtesy. Bye.

04:51.261 --> 04:52.257
Raylan!

04:56.183 --> 04:59.267
I just got a call that your daddy
violated his tether again.

04:59.477 --> 05:02.478
Well, if they find him, they can do with
him as they see fit.

05:02.606 --> 05:05.097
Hey, look what the cat dragged in.

05:05.233 --> 05:06.893
Hey. Who let you out of Harlan?

05:07.027 --> 05:11.274
Well, they told me to drop on by, see how
you big-time federal police get it done.

05:11.406 --> 05:13.280
- Well, watch and learn, son.
- Yeah.

05:13.408 --> 05:15.116
- Listen, I got a question.
- Shoot.

05:15.368 --> 05:18.405
What would it take for you to let me have
Marshal Givens come back down to Harlan,

05:18.538 --> 05:20.827
do some more of that task-force
stuff we've been running?

05:20.957 --> 05:24.124
Ordinarily, I would say,
"Only if you promise to keep him."

05:24.252 --> 05:29.709
But considering the epic backlog of work
that he has, I got to ask, what for?

05:29.841 --> 05:32.961
Well, because it seems like that Oxy
bus is just sort of the tip of the iceberg

05:33.094 --> 05:35.846
as far as people trying to fill
the Crowders' shoes down there.

05:35.972 --> 05:39.057
And how exactly do you think
Raylan here would be useful to you?

05:39.684 --> 05:41.511
Well, Art, I've been in Harlan 18 years.

05:41.770 --> 05:45.388
People still look at me like I'm some kind of
Yankee come down there to burn their crops.

05:45.774 --> 05:46.805
But this guy...

05:46.942 --> 05:48.021
I know my people.

05:48.151 --> 05:49.776
You're like the hillbilly whisperer.

05:49.903 --> 05:52.109
- Put you on <i>Oprah.</i>
- I'll get my coat.

05:52.239 --> 05:53.484
You can catch me up on the way down.

05:53.615 --> 05:57.114
Just hold on, Cochise.
Now, Tom, I hear you.

05:57.244 --> 05:59.070
And I know that Raylan
here would probably

05:59.204 --> 06:01.873
prefer being down there
running down this grudge,

06:01.998 --> 06:04.324
but I actually kind of
need him here to do some marshal shit.

06:04.459 --> 06:05.574
What are you talking about?

06:05.710 --> 06:08.497
I'm talking about whatever this
business is with the Bennetts.

06:08.630 --> 06:11.500
It is beyond the purview of
what I like to call your job.

06:11.633 --> 06:14.088
Speaking of which, I stopped by up at
their place the other day.

06:14.261 --> 06:17.676
Yeah. You stopped by to do some dynamite
fishing and see what you could get

06:17.806 --> 06:19.715
- to bob up to the surface.
- On my own time.

06:19.849 --> 06:21.344
Wearing your badge.

06:21.476 --> 06:23.552
Anyway, I saw Loretta McCready.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.763
Any sign of her daddy
since we checked on him?

06:25.981 --> 06:27.558
You know, it's funny
you should mention McCready,

06:27.691 --> 06:30.146
'cause I thought he popped
back up in town last week or so.

06:30.277 --> 06:32.068
Somebody's been cashing his
state-benefit cheques.

06:32.195 --> 06:36.904
But if you have a nice, close look at these
signatures, they're a little inconsistent.

06:38.076 --> 06:39.107
Are you thinking a forgery?

06:39.661 --> 06:41.321
Kind of a shaky hand, wouldn't you say?

06:41.454 --> 06:42.699
Standards appear to be slipping.

06:42.831 --> 06:44.704
Gentlemen, this is really fascinating

06:44.833 --> 06:50.207
and strangely heartbreaking, but I just
don't see what I get out of all this.

06:50.797 --> 06:53.798
Mullen. No shit.

06:55.510 --> 06:56.506
Hold on a minute.

06:57.595 --> 07:00.169
- Well, they found your daddy.
- Where?

07:00.348 --> 07:02.424
Somewhere between the third
and the fourth floor.

07:03.560 --> 07:04.840
Here?

07:06.730 --> 07:08.971
There. You happy now?

07:09.107 --> 07:11.265
- I don't know. Should I be?
- Well, you won, didn't you?

07:11.401 --> 07:13.394
Beat an old man down, got your way.

07:14.112 --> 07:17.148
He's been at the Wild Turkey
on the way up, so he's in a sulk.

07:17.282 --> 07:19.951
Well, you violated your tether range
coming up here, Arlo.

07:20.076 --> 07:24.987
Brought you your damn money, so
you can just cut this thing off my leg.

07:25.123 --> 07:30.283
Well, math was never my prime subject,
but this feels quite a bit south of 20,000.

07:30.420 --> 07:34.287
Six thousand, thereabouts.
All I got left. Take it or leave it.

07:34.424 --> 07:37.045
I'll take it.
And you can take him to the cell.

07:37.177 --> 07:40.343
- What the hell? It's something, ain't it?
- He hasn't got any more, Raylan.

07:40.472 --> 07:42.595
- That's it.
- I'm not running a yard sale here, Helen.

07:42.766 --> 07:43.880
Arlo, you owe what you owe.

07:44.017 --> 07:46.424
So, what? I wasted my time, then?
Give me that money back.

07:46.561 --> 07:48.304
You want to get out of your obligation,

07:48.438 --> 07:54.476
you give us the rest. Or maybe
you got $14,000 in information.

07:54.611 --> 07:58.359
- What we paid for in the first place.
- Well, what you looking for?

07:58.490 --> 08:00.529
Looking for who might trade
in illegal papers,

08:00.658 --> 08:03.114
stolen government draw cheques
and such in Harlan.

08:03.578 --> 08:05.784
Now, why would I know
anything about that?

08:05.914 --> 08:10.908
I don't know. Harlan County, petty
bullshit crime, you. Call it a hunch.

08:11.044 --> 08:12.242
What's the play look like?

08:12.379 --> 08:15.130
Someone's been cashing a man's
cheques, and we don't think it's him.

08:15.256 --> 08:16.537
Raylan?

08:16.674 --> 08:18.501
This got anything to
do with Mags Bennett?

08:19.677 --> 08:21.053
I don't think so.

08:22.806 --> 08:23.885
Can't help you.

08:24.015 --> 08:25.972
Why doesn't that surprise me?

08:26.351 --> 08:27.631
Ask me something else.

08:27.769 --> 08:29.477
I don't give a shit about
"something else."

08:29.604 --> 08:31.098
- For God's sake!
- Helen, you shut your mouth.

08:31.314 --> 08:34.932
The hell I will. I want you gone,
and if this helps, good.

08:35.318 --> 08:37.145
Raylan, there's only one man
in three counties

08:37.278 --> 08:39.437
that'll give you anything like
a fair deal on draw cheques.

08:39.572 --> 08:40.687
And that man would be?

08:40.823 --> 08:42.318
Boning you in the ass.

08:42.866 --> 08:46.817
Go ahead, woman. You already yakked
up this much. Lay it on him.

08:48.748 --> 08:49.946
Helen?

08:51.626 --> 08:52.705
Bowman Crowder.

08:53.545 --> 08:56.748
Damn shame,
man you want being dead in a box.

08:56.881 --> 08:59.716
At the hands of your old
girlfriend, wasn't it?

09:01.219 --> 09:03.840
You let me know if you get him talking.

09:03.972 --> 09:06.973
Be mighty interested to
hear anything he's got to say.

09:08.726 --> 09:12.392
All right, Boyd, one more time.
While you're taking the packets

09:12.522 --> 09:15.357
down to the splinter shaft, we're
gonna transfer the cash to the truck.

09:15.483 --> 09:16.942
Pruitt's gonna drive
it down the mountain.

09:17.068 --> 09:19.773
That right. And Marcus and I join you in
the hole. And then...

09:19.904 --> 09:22.193
- Boom.
- Drop the ceiling between us and the surface.

09:22.323 --> 09:25.692
Now, the man guarding his take, now,
I've known this man for quite some time.

09:25.827 --> 09:27.570
He will not easily part
with company money.

09:27.704 --> 09:30.824
Who, Shelby? Shit, Boyd.
Dude's older than shit.

09:30.957 --> 09:34.540
Yet again, he's a steady hand on that
.44 he keeps right underneath his desk.

09:38.965 --> 09:41.171
You ain't gonna have
to worry about Shelby.

09:41.301 --> 09:42.415
Yeah? Why is that?

09:42.552 --> 09:44.295
'Cause you're gonna kill him.

09:46.055 --> 09:50.433
Well, now,
you never mentioned bloodshed.

09:50.810 --> 09:53.432
Now, if you had brought this up earlier,
I don't know if this conversation

09:53.563 --> 09:54.974
would be going on this long.

09:55.106 --> 09:58.107
You've killed men for far less, Boyd.
Let's keep our eye on the prize.

09:58.234 --> 10:01.817
Take Shelby down in the shaft until you
set up the det. Once it's wired,

10:01.988 --> 10:05.523
you lay a shovel upside his head real
hard. Cave-in will take care of the rest.

10:05.658 --> 10:07.532
See?
That's the genius of the whole thing.

10:07.660 --> 10:11.492
Everybody will think that he stole the money,
tried to blow up the shaft behind him,

10:11.623 --> 10:12.903
but instead, premature detonation.

10:13.082 --> 10:15.205
We was just the poor
miners who got caught up in all of it.

10:16.002 --> 10:20.379
Well, if this is gonna go down today,
the devil lies in the details.

10:20.507 --> 10:25.215
Stop worrying about the details. Let
me worry about the details, all right?

10:25.345 --> 10:27.836
We're counting on you for one thing
and one thing alone.

10:27.972 --> 10:30.546
- What's that?
- You're the powderman, Boyd.

10:30.683 --> 10:35.345
We need you to make sure this mountain
don't come down on us and kill us.

10:36.022 --> 10:39.142
Now, once you set it, we're gonna
detonate remotely. All right?

10:39.275 --> 10:40.271
ATF will be all over this thing.

10:40.401 --> 10:42.857
We don't need any extra
det wire tipping 'em off.

10:47.408 --> 10:48.951
Well, I should probably get that.

11:00.588 --> 11:01.869
Hello?

11:02.757 --> 11:04.417
Why, hello, Ava.

11:04.551 --> 11:05.665
Ain't that his girlfriend?

11:05.802 --> 11:07.082
He should be so lucky.

11:07.470 --> 11:08.929
We should all be so lucky.

11:10.014 --> 11:13.846
I'm listening. I hear that.

11:14.394 --> 11:17.348
Come on. All we got to do is charge this
thing up. We're ready to rock. Let's go.

11:18.731 --> 11:21.685
- Let's wrap it up, Boyd.
- No. That's just the TV.

11:22.068 --> 11:23.776
I'm here all by myself.

11:27.657 --> 11:28.688
You think he knows?

11:29.867 --> 11:33.201
<i>- Don't worry about Boyd.</i>
- Kyle, what if he bails on us?

11:33.621 --> 11:35.365
Then we do him now instead of later.

11:36.749 --> 11:39.287
<i>When he goes down in the mine,
we'll just blow him up.</i>

11:40.753 --> 11:41.916
Pruitt!

11:42.755 --> 11:44.582
I got to go now, Ava.

11:52.682 --> 11:54.675
Got you on a tight leash, huh?

11:54.809 --> 11:56.517
Well, I wouldn't say that.

12:00.273 --> 12:02.182
What's it gonna be, Boyd?
We're running out of time.

12:02.609 --> 12:05.479
Well, what it is that you're asking
me to do, I can do.

12:05.820 --> 12:07.647
But radio det adds a whole
new host of complexities.

12:07.780 --> 12:09.405
There's only one way
this is gonna work.

12:10.074 --> 12:11.106
How's that?

12:11.242 --> 12:16.948
You and your boys, you do exactly
what I say, when I say it.

12:18.917 --> 12:20.459
That's the only way I
can keep us all alive.

12:21.628 --> 12:23.916
Well, hell, Boyd.

12:24.047 --> 12:26.288
As many people as you robbed,

12:27.550 --> 12:29.626
I wouldn't have it any other way.

12:41.939 --> 12:43.683
- What are you doing?
- Dishes.

12:45.902 --> 12:46.981
Is it charged?

12:47.111 --> 12:49.353
No, Kyle, for the fifth time, it is not.

12:52.784 --> 12:53.982
Who the hell is that?

12:54.786 --> 12:56.494
That's the United
States Federal Marshal.

12:57.413 --> 12:58.872
Well, what's he doing here, Boyd?

12:58.998 --> 13:00.113
I couldn't say.

13:04.087 --> 13:05.629
Hey, Pruitt, what the hell is this?

13:07.548 --> 13:08.829
Kyle, get out here.

13:10.551 --> 13:13.802
Hello, fellas.
Don't believe I've had the pleasure.

13:13.930 --> 13:17.381
You don't need to know us.
We mind our own business.

13:17.517 --> 13:19.474
Suppose it'd be best you do the same.

13:19.811 --> 13:21.186
Well, that wouldn't be like me.

13:21.562 --> 13:22.594
What do we do?

13:22.730 --> 13:25.221
My play's always to stop him before he
gets on the front porch.

13:25.817 --> 13:27.192
Shit, Boyd.

13:27.402 --> 13:29.560
Deputy US Marshal Raylan Givens.

13:29.696 --> 13:32.946
Pleased to meet you, Marshal.
We're Boyd's friends from the mine.

13:33.074 --> 13:34.782
We just come to pick him up for work.
That's all.

13:35.576 --> 13:38.328
Nice to see Boyd's
making acquaintances.

13:49.966 --> 13:53.549
I'm gonna step up to the door now, Kyle.
Do you see that as being a problem?

13:53.678 --> 13:56.845
Step inside to do the dishes for two
minutes, look who comes by to visit.

13:56.973 --> 13:59.215
Boyd. Your friends and I were just
getting acquainted.

13:59.350 --> 14:01.592
I can see that. What brings
you up to the holler, Raylan?

14:01.728 --> 14:02.890
Just need a word.

14:06.190 --> 14:09.144
Why don't you go make
yourself at home on the porch?

14:21.956 --> 14:26.036
Now, Boyd,
I've been doing this long enough.

14:26.169 --> 14:30.083
I can spot outlaws at a thousand paces.
Your friends?

14:30.798 --> 14:32.838
They're packing, one and all.

14:32.967 --> 14:34.212
Well, I wouldn't know.

14:34.343 --> 14:36.336
But I'm sure none of them
is carrying with ill intent.

14:36.471 --> 14:37.669
Well, that's good.

14:38.473 --> 14:39.848
What are you after, Raylan?

14:41.392 --> 14:44.144
Your brother, Bowman.
You know anything about him trading

14:44.270 --> 14:46.891
in stolen papers back when?
Draw cheques and such?

14:47.023 --> 14:50.107
Well, there's little by way of illicit
activity in this county that my brother

14:50.234 --> 14:52.227
did not have his hands on in
one way or another.

14:52.361 --> 14:54.021
Which is why I'm here.

14:56.908 --> 14:59.315
You never really knew my brother,
Bowman, did you, Raylan?

14:59.452 --> 15:01.361
I saw him play football.

15:01.496 --> 15:05.707
Gunned down in his prime by the very hand
of the woman I now share his roof with.

15:06.959 --> 15:09.877
Not hard to fathom his end,
given the life that he led.

15:11.589 --> 15:14.709
My brother Bowman did not deal
directly in paper, Raylan.

15:14.926 --> 15:16.717
He handed it off to this Jesus freak.

15:16.969 --> 15:19.721
Runs that Christian ATV place up
in Grant's Holler.

15:19.889 --> 15:21.680
You mean old Winston Baines?

15:21.808 --> 15:24.643
Take an ATV tour and get,
like, a sermon on the mount?

15:24.769 --> 15:26.975
Steward of the Earth,
just like in Genesis.

15:27.271 --> 15:30.854
Little twitchy. I don't even
know if he's still in the game or not.

15:31.192 --> 15:32.651
Come on, Boyd!

15:32.777 --> 15:35.897
Well, I guess me and these boys,
we need to get on to work.

15:36.864 --> 15:38.987
- Anything else you need?
- Not right now.

15:39.116 --> 15:41.109
Well, you take care of yourself, Raylan.

15:42.078 --> 15:43.358
You, too, Boyd.

15:51.796 --> 15:53.420
Well, what the hell was that about?

15:54.298 --> 15:56.338
Just some questions about my dead
brother, Bowman.

15:56.467 --> 15:58.092
Is that right? What kind of questions?

15:58.219 --> 15:59.382
Well, it's personal.

16:00.012 --> 16:02.503
Besides, we got more pressing issues
to attend to.

16:02.682 --> 16:03.677
Is that right?

16:07.520 --> 16:11.518
The battery, it's not taking a charge.
Don't know who you bought this thing from,

16:11.649 --> 16:13.024
but they must have seen you coming.

16:13.151 --> 16:14.942
- Shit. Are you kidding me?
- We got to pick up another one!

16:15.069 --> 16:17.227
Hell no. It's 90 minutes there and back.
We'll miss the shift.

16:17.363 --> 16:18.738
Well, then we do it again next time.

16:18.990 --> 16:20.947
There ain't gonna be
no next time, Boyd!

16:21.075 --> 16:23.613
- This is the only chance we got!
- The most important thing to know

16:23.744 --> 16:26.580
- in this business is when to walk away.
- We're not walking away.

16:26.831 --> 16:30.414
We'll hit up the Radio Shack on the way
there, try to rig something up. All right?

16:32.295 --> 16:34.038
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

16:37.425 --> 16:39.216
What are you doing now?

16:39.343 --> 16:41.336
Writing a note to Ava and letting
her know I'm gonna be late.

16:41.554 --> 16:42.882
Damn, Boyd.

16:43.306 --> 16:46.888
Done. That didn't take long, did it?

16:48.102 --> 16:49.893
If you want to make a
living in this business,

16:50.021 --> 16:51.930
you got to know your ABCs.

16:53.316 --> 16:54.644
"Always be cool."

17:09.248 --> 17:12.083
You sure your Radio Shack
work-around's gonna do the trick?

17:12.209 --> 17:14.083
I'd hate to drive all
this way for nothing.

17:14.712 --> 17:16.954
Don't worry about it. Just focus
on setting them charges right.

17:17.089 --> 17:18.204
I don't want to suffocate down there.

17:18.340 --> 17:22.089
You will not die down in that hole, Kyle.
You have my word on that.

17:22.929 --> 17:26.298
And you have my word these batteries are
gonna do their job. God damn, Boyd.

17:26.432 --> 17:29.350
We're about to be rich.
How you like that?

17:52.375 --> 17:54.866
"The Church of the Two-Stroke Jesus."
That's good.

17:55.002 --> 17:57.920
It's a good angle with the tourists that
come to see the Bible Belt in action.

17:58.047 --> 18:01.297
Honest-to-God church,
sanctioned by the state.

18:01.425 --> 18:05.637
Two things important in life,
praise God and ride hard.

18:05.763 --> 18:08.336
- Amen.
- I try to give each its due.

18:08.474 --> 18:11.677
Was asking about cheques
from the state draw, turned up cashed.

18:11.811 --> 18:15.144
Folks say you might be
a person to talk to about such matters.

18:15.272 --> 18:18.641
Well, there was a time
that I might have

18:18.776 --> 18:22.608
helped out my fellow downtrodden
Kentuckians lay hands on their money.

18:22.738 --> 18:25.194
You saying that time has passed?

18:25.825 --> 18:30.783
The Lord has seen fit to bless my little
off-road business in recent years.

18:30.913 --> 18:35.242
Folks tour mountaintop removal sites,
and bears have started to come back.

18:35.376 --> 18:38.246
So, you wouldn't know anything
about your signature

18:38.462 --> 18:41.878
matching up with the one of a
Walt McCready, then, signed last week.

18:43.592 --> 18:44.672
Say again? "McCready"?

18:44.802 --> 18:46.629
Yeah, no, I got the cheques here

18:46.762 --> 18:50.131
with the samples of your first tour
up at Big Sandy.

18:50.266 --> 18:52.223
You want to take a look,
maybe refresh your memory?

18:52.351 --> 18:53.347
I need my glasses.

18:54.020 --> 18:56.593
- Well.
- Let's see.

19:10.036 --> 19:12.657
Son of a bitch.

19:37.730 --> 19:41.313
Sounds like it's back up to
about fifty percent.

19:41.817 --> 19:44.652
It takes a while after that wallop.

19:44.820 --> 19:47.442
Tased me in the nuts,
you son of a bitch.

19:47.698 --> 19:49.406
I tried to shoot you first.

19:49.533 --> 19:52.949
I get up from here, I'm gonna grab that
thing and cram it right up your...

19:56.624 --> 19:58.035
Now it's back down to thirty.

20:02.671 --> 20:03.952
McCready.

20:04.673 --> 20:06.168
Don't know no McCready.

20:07.593 --> 20:10.843
You ever been tased in the mouth?
Baines?

20:12.765 --> 20:16.348
I'm just thinking that probably
hurts worse than a jolt to the pecker.

20:17.394 --> 20:20.348
Go ahead, then. Do your worst.

20:21.857 --> 20:25.143
I ain't telling you shit, or anybody else.

20:39.250 --> 20:41.538
Man down! Man down!

20:41.669 --> 20:43.163
- Shut her down!
- We got a man down!

20:43.295 --> 20:44.327
Shut her down!

20:44.463 --> 20:48.295
Come on. We got it. We got it. He's
got the angina. He's got the angina.

20:48.425 --> 20:49.801
He just needs some fresh air.
He'll be all right.

20:49.927 --> 20:50.923
Is he all right?

20:51.053 --> 20:52.084
Watch out.

20:52.221 --> 20:53.336
Clear a path, boys.

20:53.472 --> 20:54.468
Watch out.

20:54.765 --> 20:55.928
This way.

21:02.148 --> 21:03.855
What are we waiting for, bitches?
Let's do this!

21:03.983 --> 21:07.019
Hey, hey! Cell phones. Hand them over.

21:07.361 --> 21:08.606
What the hell for, man?

21:08.737 --> 21:10.896
Because, Marcus, we're about to
set off a remote detonation.

21:11.031 --> 21:13.071
That's 20 pounds of
Emulex triggered by a radio signal.

21:13.200 --> 21:16.118
Wrong signal on our frequency,
we're all shaking hands with Jesus.

21:16.328 --> 21:18.072
So I'm just being overly cautious.

21:19.540 --> 21:20.868
Look, you'll get them back.

21:21.083 --> 21:23.788
I just want to make sure that
they're off, for myself. Let's go.

21:24.003 --> 21:25.201
Hand them over.

21:28.257 --> 21:29.537
Damn, Boyd.

21:44.190 --> 21:45.352
Damn it, Boyd.

22:16.555 --> 22:17.931
What the hell?

22:24.021 --> 22:25.017
Got it.

22:27.483 --> 22:29.310
All right? Let's go.

22:40.829 --> 22:42.537
Hands up, fool! This is a robbery!

22:42.706 --> 22:44.580
Well shit, son, I can see that.

22:44.708 --> 22:46.582
Don't get smart, Shelby.
Put your damn hands up.

22:47.920 --> 22:48.916
Oh!

22:49.046 --> 22:50.042
Woo, doggy!

22:50.172 --> 22:51.168
How you like that, you old fruit bat?

22:51.298 --> 22:52.958
No call to be disrespectful.

22:53.133 --> 22:56.253
Shut up. Boyd, put those
explosives in the brown bag.

22:57.513 --> 22:58.924
Get down.

23:00.224 --> 23:01.255
Open it.

23:01.392 --> 23:02.969
You got the det.
Why don't you just blow it?

23:03.102 --> 23:05.059
I'd just as soon decorate
it with your face!

23:05.187 --> 23:07.678
You got the combination. Now open it.

23:09.483 --> 23:10.858
Come on! Hurry up, damn it!

23:11.068 --> 23:13.357
Marcus, you're making me nervous.
Would you please back up?

23:14.071 --> 23:15.186
Come on, open it.

23:16.323 --> 23:18.031
- Boyd, you about done?
- Jesus Christ, old man!

23:18.158 --> 23:19.653
How many numbers is it?

23:19.785 --> 23:21.113
Boyd, Boyd! You almost done?

23:22.663 --> 23:23.778
Almost done, Kyle.

23:27.418 --> 23:31.581
Holy shit. Woo-hoo-hoo!

23:31.880 --> 23:33.043
We got the jackpot!

23:34.174 --> 23:37.543
Boyd, would you please put all
that money in that green bag?

23:39.763 --> 23:40.759
Come on.

23:50.441 --> 23:51.436
What is that?

23:58.365 --> 23:59.943
It's a goddamn cell phone.

24:00.242 --> 24:02.401
No, you turned it off.

24:03.287 --> 24:05.244
You trying to get us all killed, Kyle?

24:05.372 --> 24:06.831
You turned this off.

24:07.666 --> 24:08.662
Get out of the trailer.

24:10.169 --> 24:12.327
Go on. Get out of the trailer, Kyle.

24:15.007 --> 24:16.750
Get all that money in that bag.

24:18.093 --> 24:19.291
Let's go.

24:29.146 --> 24:32.681
These hillbilly doorbells really know a
federal when they smell one, huh?

24:33.567 --> 24:36.105
Aw, shit! Better put the weed away.

24:36.278 --> 24:39.314
Although, I got to tell you, I'm surprised
they can smell anything over that shit.

24:39.448 --> 24:40.990
Ah! Dank and delicious.

24:41.116 --> 24:42.112
Oh, I bet.

24:44.828 --> 24:46.370
That's quite a hack you got there.

24:46.872 --> 24:48.948
You don't cough, you don't get off.

24:49.249 --> 24:50.245
So I've heard.

24:50.376 --> 24:51.371
Yeah.

24:51.627 --> 24:55.838
Listen, I know he ain't here, but you're
in touch with Walt McCready, right?

24:57.466 --> 25:00.004
Your mama said he was working for
the family down south somewhere?

25:00.636 --> 25:03.886
That's what she said?
Well, then, that's what she said.

25:04.014 --> 25:06.422
I know you're cashing his draw cheques
for him.

25:06.642 --> 25:09.263
You sending him the money,
or you keeping it for yourself?

25:10.979 --> 25:15.143
Well, anyway, uh, if you see Walt,
will you tell him I was asking after him?

25:16.026 --> 25:17.022
What for?

25:17.236 --> 25:20.818
Just a few things to clear up
in this earlier case with the molester,

25:21.657 --> 25:24.195
Jimmy Earl Dean.
Just dotting the I's, that sort of thing.

25:25.911 --> 25:27.109
All right.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.242
I'll let you get back to it.

25:33.127 --> 25:34.289
All right, let's go.

25:35.462 --> 25:36.791
That phone was off. You checked it.

25:37.256 --> 25:40.126
Yeah, then why did it ring?
I'll be holding on to that,

25:40.259 --> 25:43.094
in case one of you other dumbasses
decides to let your cell phone ring.

25:44.263 --> 25:46.220
These batteries will stay with me.

25:47.015 --> 25:48.260
Hand him that shovel.

25:49.184 --> 25:50.560
We're almost there.

25:50.811 --> 25:52.139
Shelby, you're not gonna do
something stupid

25:52.312 --> 25:53.937
and make me pop you in the gut
and carry you down?

25:54.356 --> 25:55.352
I will not.

25:55.482 --> 25:59.017
Good. You get this cash out of here.
I'll see you down in the hole.

25:59.486 --> 26:00.815
Bring that detonator.

26:00.946 --> 26:02.274
Put the money in the toolbox.

26:02.406 --> 26:03.485
Let's go for a walk, Shelby.

26:03.615 --> 26:04.860
Kyle, he's got the batteries.

26:04.992 --> 26:06.237
What the hell are we gonna do?

26:07.202 --> 26:09.029
Let me ask you something, Marcus.

26:09.163 --> 26:11.488
How stupid do you think I am?

26:11.665 --> 26:12.780
16 years in the Boy Scouts.

26:12.916 --> 26:15.787
My daddy promised me a Marshall
stack as long as I made Eagle.

26:15.919 --> 26:17.829
Well, howdy, I tell you what.
I rocked out that summer.

26:17.963 --> 26:20.798
The only other thing I remember,

26:21.049 --> 26:22.164
"Be prepared."

26:24.344 --> 26:26.337
Take my batteries, I'll
get another battery.

26:29.933 --> 26:32.768
Turn down right here. Face that wall.

26:34.563 --> 26:36.520
What are you gonna do
with those explosives?

26:37.107 --> 26:38.732
You gonna cave in this mine?

26:38.859 --> 26:40.318
You just stay right there.

26:44.656 --> 26:47.147
God damn it, Boyd.
If you're gonna kill me, just kill me.

26:48.869 --> 26:49.865
You ready?

26:49.995 --> 26:51.620
Hey, so long, there, Boyd!

27:30.160 --> 27:32.485
What would have happened
if they had checked that bag?

27:34.748 --> 27:36.491
Then we'd be dead, Shelby.

27:42.005 --> 27:43.832
I'm sorry to get you mixed up in this.

27:44.424 --> 27:46.464
It wasn't supposed to go down this way.

27:46.843 --> 27:50.426
Well, son.
I'm walking away, as far as I know.

27:50.639 --> 27:51.967
Unless you're planning
on putting one in me.

27:52.099 --> 27:53.593
No, sir, I am not.

27:53.809 --> 27:57.308
Well, then I guess you saved my life.
I got nothing to complain about.

27:57.813 --> 27:59.141
Who'd listen if I did?

27:59.481 --> 28:03.431
Well, then might I be so bold
as to ask you for a favour?

28:03.902 --> 28:04.981
Name it.

28:05.404 --> 28:06.435
The cops are gonna come.

28:06.572 --> 28:09.572
ATF, dogs, everything our federal
government has to bear.

28:09.700 --> 28:13.780
Now, you tell them that I had to go home.
It was an emergency, nothing else.

28:13.912 --> 28:14.943
Do you understand?

28:16.498 --> 28:17.494
Shelby?

28:18.333 --> 28:19.329
Done, sir.

28:45.736 --> 28:46.731
No one here.

28:48.447 --> 28:52.029
Yes, I am able to see that, Coover.
Thank you.

28:53.201 --> 28:55.739
You think he told the federal
we gave him the cheques to cash?

28:55.871 --> 28:58.872
Maybe we should ask the federal.

29:01.209 --> 29:02.372
Oh, shit.

29:05.380 --> 29:06.412
Do we run?

29:06.548 --> 29:08.505
No, we do not run.

29:09.509 --> 29:11.502
Reverend Baines must
not have told him.

29:11.637 --> 29:15.337
Otherwise, Raylan would be
arresting us right now.

29:16.058 --> 29:17.053
But he knows.

29:17.184 --> 29:20.019
Yeah, he knows, but he can't prove it.

29:23.607 --> 29:24.721
Raylan Givens!

29:24.858 --> 29:25.854
Dickie.

29:25.984 --> 29:26.980
There he is.

29:27.110 --> 29:29.020
- How you doing, Coover?
- Raylan.

29:30.364 --> 29:31.359
Eat shit.

29:32.532 --> 29:33.777
So, what do we do?

29:34.743 --> 29:38.326
Well, we drive on out of here and
give Doyle a call on the way.

29:40.415 --> 29:42.040
Get in. Come on.

29:42.167 --> 29:43.412
Yeah. Let's go.

30:12.447 --> 30:15.697
Well, I can see by your face
you're somewhat troubled.

30:17.452 --> 30:19.279
I can only imagine what
I had to do with that.

30:19.538 --> 30:23.998
"Call this number at exactly 6:05 p.m.
Don't tell anybody."

30:24.835 --> 30:29.497
Well, I admit it was terse.

30:36.138 --> 30:38.177
I wrote it under some time pressure.

30:38.598 --> 30:41.006
Boyd, what the hell is this?

30:41.727 --> 30:42.722
A favour.

30:44.312 --> 30:46.270
And what would have happened
if I hadn't called?

30:46.440 --> 30:48.646
Well, you wouldn't be
speaking to me right now, Ava.

30:48.984 --> 30:50.182
Damn it, Boyd.

30:50.527 --> 30:52.520
What the hell you gone and
made me a part of?

30:53.572 --> 30:55.196
Just saving my life.

30:57.284 --> 30:58.280
Nothing else.

31:12.257 --> 31:13.253
What did I miss?

31:13.383 --> 31:15.874
Coover came by with brother Dickie.

31:16.636 --> 31:18.546
They were taking McCready's
draw cheques to Baines.

31:19.639 --> 31:22.177
I don't suppose Baines
said anything to you, did he?

31:22.309 --> 31:24.348
Some crazy story about
you tasing him in the nuts.

31:24.686 --> 31:25.682
I did.

31:25.812 --> 31:27.390
Nice. So?

31:29.441 --> 31:31.398
So, either the Bennetts are
just being neighbourly,

31:31.568 --> 31:34.569
cashing McCready's cheques for him
and sending him the money...

31:34.696 --> 31:35.894
Or he's dead.

31:36.239 --> 31:37.568
The more likely option.

31:39.242 --> 31:40.820
And I'm worried about that girl.

31:40.952 --> 31:42.233
Me, too.

31:42.954 --> 31:45.196
From what I understand about Loretta,
she's a pretty tough kid.

31:45.332 --> 31:46.743
She's fourteen.

31:47.250 --> 31:49.457
What were you like at 14,
growing up around these parts?

31:52.672 --> 31:53.668
Call Child Protection?

31:53.799 --> 31:54.878
And say what?

31:55.008 --> 31:56.751
She's being clothed and fed?

31:58.386 --> 32:00.094
Yeah. Look, I got to get.

32:00.263 --> 32:02.968
I got a world of shit coming off
that explosion up at the Plackett mine.

32:03.183 --> 32:05.935
Yeah, I saw the fire-and-rescue trucks.

32:06.061 --> 32:07.175
- Collapse?
- No.

32:07.521 --> 32:08.801
Somebody blew up a truck with Emulex.

32:08.939 --> 32:12.224
Looks like they were fixing to rob the payroll,
had some sort of premature detonation.

32:12.359 --> 32:14.647
- Boyd?
- You mean is he dead or did he rob it?

32:14.778 --> 32:17.316
- Either one.
- No sign of his body in the truck wreckage.

32:17.697 --> 32:20.271
ATF is looking for him now. I'll see you.

32:24.913 --> 32:27.404
I don't believe they intended
to let me live through the day.

32:28.333 --> 32:30.207
Didn't think I was
gonna find a way out.

32:32.671 --> 32:38.258
Part of me just felt like laying down,
letting it happen.

32:39.386 --> 32:40.880
But you killed them instead.

32:41.012 --> 32:42.637
Well, I gave them a choice.

32:42.764 --> 32:44.223
Now, if they hadn't have pulled
that switch on me

32:44.349 --> 32:46.970
when I was down there in that hole,
things would have gone down different.

32:47.102 --> 32:48.845
So the way I see it, Ava,

32:48.979 --> 32:51.980
they killed themselves,
with greed and avarice.

32:52.816 --> 32:55.603
When I called that cell, did I...

32:55.861 --> 32:56.856
No.

32:57.529 --> 32:59.189
It allowed me to kick
them out of the trailer.

33:00.156 --> 33:03.241
I put a little cash on the Emulex,
a little Emulex on the cash,

33:04.077 --> 33:07.078
and I made sure that the blasting cap
went in their packet and not mine.

33:09.875 --> 33:13.955
You could have run when Raylan came
by, just lit out and let the chips fall.

33:15.255 --> 33:19.418
What does it say about me that that
thought never crossed my mind?

33:22.387 --> 33:25.423
Why did you agree to rob that mine
in the first place?

33:26.766 --> 33:28.510
Because it's what I do.

33:29.853 --> 33:30.849
It's who I am, Ava,

33:32.522 --> 33:34.562
as hard as I've been trying
to pretend otherwise.

33:36.860 --> 33:38.983
Everybody else seems
to know that but me.

33:41.531 --> 33:45.860
Anyway, I came across that letter
that you received from the bank.

33:48.246 --> 33:50.286
Boyd, I don't...

33:50.790 --> 33:54.041
I violated your privacy.
For that transgression, I do apologise.

33:54.920 --> 33:57.161
So you know that
they're after the house?

33:58.590 --> 34:01.674
I don't suppose any of that money
survived the blast.

34:04.763 --> 34:07.799
There should be at least
$15,000 to $20,000 in there.

34:07.933 --> 34:09.094
That's not enough to pay it off,

34:09.226 --> 34:11.348
but enough to buy you some security
for a little while.

34:12.938 --> 34:13.933
Shit.

34:19.527 --> 34:22.065
Ava, there's one more favour
that I must ask of you.

34:25.867 --> 34:27.242
Ava, you can help me

34:28.786 --> 34:31.194
or you can refuse.
Either way, I will understand.

34:38.505 --> 34:40.295
But I'm gonna need to know
your answer right now.

34:46.262 --> 34:47.591
Hey, hey, here he comes.

34:48.514 --> 34:49.545
Shit, Mama's with him.

34:57.315 --> 34:58.691
Hey, Mama.

35:02.445 --> 35:03.441
We need to talk.

35:05.407 --> 35:06.486
Can I get you something, Mama?

35:06.616 --> 35:09.700
Nothing's going to take the taste away
from my boys going behind my back.

35:11.663 --> 35:13.988
- Mama, we never went behind...
- Cashing McCready's draw cheques?

35:15.458 --> 35:17.830
How long did you think it'd
take before that'd come back on us?

35:17.961 --> 35:19.336
Mama, that's that federal.

35:19.462 --> 35:20.873
He's aiming for trouble with us,
always has been.

35:21.006 --> 35:22.464
'Cause of your actions.

35:24.384 --> 35:28.002
Starting with hiring that pederast
to do a job I give you.

35:31.641 --> 35:32.756
I'm sorry, Mama.

35:33.018 --> 35:34.346
Coover, I know you're sorry.

35:38.189 --> 35:40.229
That's why it's gonna hurt so much
to have to do this.

35:41.151 --> 35:44.270
Hey, now! Hey, hey, now! Hey!

35:45.238 --> 35:46.780
- Hey!
- Put your hand on the stump!

35:46.906 --> 35:48.484
- Hey!
- Put your hand on the stump!

35:49.868 --> 35:51.113
Take what's coming.

35:51.327 --> 35:53.071
- Mama?
- I'm saving your gun hand, now.

35:53.204 --> 35:54.200
Mama, don't hurt me.

35:54.331 --> 35:55.908
Cross me again, and I
will leave you nothing.

35:56.041 --> 35:57.914
- Mama! You ain't got to do this.
- You shut your mouth!

35:58.043 --> 35:59.038
Mama?

35:59.169 --> 36:00.544
'Cause you're crippled
to the point of worthlessness

36:00.670 --> 36:02.045
it ain't you down on that table.

36:03.256 --> 36:05.296
As it is, I have to hurt Coover.

36:06.509 --> 36:07.541
And I like Coover.

36:07.677 --> 36:08.922
Mama, I love you.

36:09.054 --> 36:10.797
Mama, I love you. Mama, no!

36:39.250 --> 36:41.290
We need to talk about
what comes next.

36:45.256 --> 36:47.296
I'm sorry, Mama.

36:47.759 --> 36:49.798
Mama. I love you. I'm sorry.

36:50.386 --> 36:53.637
Gotta be shitting me, Loretta.
Twenty a gram for shake and seeds?

36:53.765 --> 36:55.923
Plenty of other ways
to get high, Levon.

36:56.059 --> 36:59.013
You can always huff paint.
Got plenty of practise at it.

36:59.145 --> 37:00.937
I'll give you 15 for a dub.

37:01.064 --> 37:04.349
Dime is 10, hence a dub is 20.
It's simple math.

37:04.484 --> 37:06.477
Shit. Five-o!

37:06.611 --> 37:09.149
Loretta. I see you're keeping busy.

37:09.864 --> 37:11.987
Marshal. I had it in my head
you weren't in the business

37:12.117 --> 37:14.405
of harassing growers
and sellers of herbal relief.

37:14.536 --> 37:15.781
Herbal relief, huh?

37:15.954 --> 37:19.204
You'll notice I make no attempt to run
or otherwise obstruct your investigation.

37:19.332 --> 37:22.203
So I hope you'll take that into
consideration before you start shooting.

37:22.502 --> 37:24.329
That's funny. Mind if I...

37:31.761 --> 37:34.050
So, if you're not here
to roust me over the weed,

37:34.180 --> 37:36.089
might I inquire as to your intentions?

37:36.558 --> 37:39.309
I know you don't trust me.
I don't fault you that,

37:39.435 --> 37:43.350
though I like to think my getting
you out of Jimmy Earl Dean's trunk

37:43.565 --> 37:45.604
might have earned me some traction.

37:51.156 --> 37:53.729
I kicked a hornet's nest last night,

37:54.242 --> 37:56.365
and things may start to happen.

37:56.494 --> 37:59.614
And I need you to know
if you find yourself in trouble,

37:59.747 --> 38:02.120
any kind, you can call me.

38:03.835 --> 38:07.370
I'll drop whatever I'm doing,
and I will come for you.

38:07.630 --> 38:09.290
You hear me?
