00:05.296 --> 00:08.255
<i>The decline in Singapore's birth rate</i>

00:08.338 --> 00:09.421
has resulted

00:09.505 --> 00:13.088
in a serious shortage of manpower
in the National Service.

00:13.713 --> 00:16.463
<i>Without an effective National Defense,</i>

00:16.546 --> 00:18.255
<i>our progress,</i>

00:18.338 --> 00:19.755
<i>prosperity,</i>

00:19.838 --> 00:21.421
<i>economic growth,</i>

00:21.505 --> 00:23.921
<i>will all be in jeopardy.</i>

00:25.380 --> 00:27.255
It's not my fault.

00:27.338 --> 00:28.213
Even my ex-boyfriend.

00:28.296 --> 00:29.421
He also ditched me
to be with someone else.

00:29.505 --> 00:30.380
- Right?
- Yes.

00:30.463 --> 00:31.963
Go away!

00:37.588 --> 00:38.880
Damn it. Who pushed me?

00:38.963 --> 00:39.921
Sorry.

00:40.005 --> 00:41.588
You'd better watch out.

00:41.671 --> 00:42.880
I have to write 1,500 lines!

00:42.963 --> 00:45.588
- No, it's just training.
- You did it on purpose!

00:45.671 --> 00:47.838
<i>Because of small things,
we fought in the bunk</i>

00:47.921 --> 00:50.380
<i>and Sergeant Chow punished us.</i>

00:50.463 --> 00:52.921
<i>Sergeant Chow did not want to confine us.</i>

00:53.005 --> 00:57.171
<i>Instead, he gave us
the Defaulter's Parade.</i>

00:57.255 --> 00:59.630
<i>Also, despite the sudden heavy rain,</i>

00:59.713 --> 01:02.505
<i>he did not stop the punishment.</i>

01:02.588 --> 01:04.005
<i>We were very unhappy</i>

01:04.088 --> 01:07.338
<i>and straight away complained
to our parents.</i>

01:07.421 --> 01:11.130
<i>Our parents straight away complained
to the Ministry of Defense.</i>

01:11.213 --> 01:12.546
<i>Because of this,</i>

01:12.630 --> 01:15.338
<i>- he was punished very seriously.</i>
- I now have no choice

01:15.421 --> 01:17.963
and post him out.

01:18.046 --> 01:21.005
- We want Sergeant Chow.
- We want Sergeant Chow.

01:21.088 --> 01:25.588
- We want Sergeant Chow.
- We want Sergeant Chow.

01:25.671 --> 01:28.838
I think I am beginning
to feel your unity, Section 2.

01:29.338 --> 01:32.213
You need to prove
that you deserve Sergeant Chow

01:32.296 --> 01:34.171
as your Platoon Sergeant.

01:34.255 --> 01:35.838
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:35.921 --> 01:37.338
- We will.
- We will.

02:08.130 --> 02:11.588
<i>Left, left, left, right, left.</i>

02:11.671 --> 02:15.171
<i>Left, left, left, right, left.</i>

02:15.255 --> 02:18.838
<i>Left, left, left, right, left.</i>

02:18.921 --> 02:22.213
Left, left, left, right, left.

02:22.296 --> 02:26.296
Left, left, left, right, left.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.796
Left, left, left, right, left.

03:01.046 --> 03:02.963
Second Sergeant CK Chow.

03:03.046 --> 03:04.630
Permission to enter, sir.

03:04.713 --> 03:05.713
Come in.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.005
Good morning, sir.

03:17.088 --> 03:18.713
Good morning.

03:18.796 --> 03:19.713
At ease.

03:20.838 --> 03:22.130
Sergeant Chow.

03:22.713 --> 03:23.630
What you have done

03:23.713 --> 03:26.380
goes against the punishment guidelines.

03:26.463 --> 03:28.005
I am sure you are aware of that.

03:28.088 --> 03:29.421
Yes, sir.

03:29.505 --> 03:31.588
This is your initiative.

03:31.671 --> 03:32.630
Good.

03:32.713 --> 03:35.463
But you have not found the right balance.

03:36.255 --> 03:37.130
Yes, sir.

03:37.213 --> 03:40.255
However, your Officer Commanding
has specially mentioned to me

03:40.338 --> 03:42.505
that your action has resulted

03:42.588 --> 03:44.380
in the unity of your Section 2.

03:44.463 --> 03:46.546
Furthermore, I have been receiving

03:46.630 --> 03:49.171
many, many emails from parents.

03:50.921 --> 03:52.755
Commending your actions

03:52.838 --> 03:55.380
and requesting a review of your case.

03:57.588 --> 03:58.505
As such,

04:06.796 --> 04:08.838
I am reconsidering your posting out.

04:11.046 --> 04:12.421
Thank you, sir.

04:12.505 --> 04:13.838
But I must tell you

04:13.921 --> 04:15.963
that what you have done

04:16.046 --> 04:18.213
is a very serious offense

04:18.296 --> 04:19.380
that if not handled well

04:19.463 --> 04:21.880
could have endangered the safety
of your recruits.

04:21.963 --> 04:23.505
I understand, sir.

04:24.546 --> 04:25.838
Because of that,

04:25.921 --> 04:29.338
you will serve seven extra duties

04:29.421 --> 04:32.338
to learn to respect our protocol.

04:32.421 --> 04:33.630
Is that clear?

04:33.713 --> 04:34.755
Yes, sir.

04:34.838 --> 04:37.088
Anything you want to say, Sergeant Chow?

04:38.921 --> 04:41.213
I deserve this, sir.

04:41.296 --> 04:43.296
I'll make sure I don't make
the same mistake again.

04:43.380 --> 04:44.588
Good.

04:45.338 --> 04:46.338
You may fall out.

04:48.588 --> 04:49.796
Thank you, sir.

05:50.921 --> 05:51.796
Hey, Kamala.

05:51.880 --> 05:54.130
We can still book out today,
thanks to Sergeant Chow.

05:54.213 --> 05:55.546
Yes.

05:56.963 --> 05:59.171
Thank you
for helping my father find a job.

05:59.255 --> 06:01.046
He has been unemployed
for half a year already.

06:01.130 --> 06:03.838
This new job really helped solve
our financial problems.

06:03.921 --> 06:06.171
Don't mention it.
We are in the same platoon, right?

06:07.296 --> 06:08.713
I also want to say thank you.

06:08.796 --> 06:10.671
You really helped
with my uncle's problems.

06:10.755 --> 06:11.588
By the way,

06:11.671 --> 06:13.546
I got you a little something.

06:13.630 --> 06:14.630
No need.

06:14.713 --> 06:15.963
We are friends, right?

06:16.046 --> 06:17.505
Are you sure?

06:17.588 --> 06:18.588
Thank you.

06:19.296 --> 06:20.921
- Today is book out day.
- Yes.

06:23.380 --> 06:24.380
Woman.

06:24.463 --> 06:27.171
You helped so many people.
Your gang must be very big.

06:27.255 --> 06:28.213
Where is your territory?

06:28.296 --> 06:30.421
I am from Ang Mo Kio, Block 706.

06:32.171 --> 06:34.046
Have you heard of the secret society?

06:34.838 --> 06:36.838
That's why it is a secret
and very secretive.

06:36.921 --> 06:38.671
I cannot tell you.

06:38.755 --> 06:40.088
You're asking for it.

06:45.171 --> 06:46.421
Joey, what is this?

06:48.130 --> 06:49.463
This is from Damien.

06:49.546 --> 06:50.880
Don't look at it anymore.

06:50.963 --> 06:53.588
- I'll help you throw it away.
- I don't want to throw it away.

06:54.546 --> 06:56.630
I want to return it to him.

06:56.713 --> 06:59.088
And tell him that it's game over.

07:00.130 --> 07:01.880
But can you follow me to his house?

07:01.963 --> 07:03.130
Is there a "tok"?

07:04.380 --> 07:05.380
A "tok"?

07:05.463 --> 07:06.838
You mean a dog?

07:06.921 --> 07:08.296
No.

07:09.921 --> 07:11.088
You look very sad.

07:12.171 --> 07:13.588
Arms clear.

07:13.671 --> 07:14.588
Thanks, ma'am.

07:18.463 --> 07:21.005
Company, arms clear.

07:21.088 --> 07:22.338
Ready to book out?

07:24.671 --> 07:26.255
<i>Today is our book out day</i>

07:26.338 --> 07:27.838
<i>- Book out, book out</i>

<i>- Book out, book out</i>

07:37.963 --> 07:39.921
Faster. Hurry up.

07:46.921 --> 07:49.630
Section 2, are you ready to book out?

07:49.713 --> 07:51.338
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Yes, Sergeant.

07:51.421 --> 07:52.963
Enjoy your weekend.

07:53.046 --> 07:54.255
Sergeant Hao.

07:54.338 --> 07:55.505
Carry on.

07:55.588 --> 07:56.963
Platoon, watch your front.

07:57.546 --> 07:59.213
Platoon, attention.

08:00.338 --> 08:02.338
Turn right.

08:03.046 --> 08:06.213
On the right, fast march.

08:06.838 --> 08:08.463
<i>- Today is our book out day</i>

Fast march.

08:23.713 --> 08:27.130
Left, left, left, right, left.

08:30.546 --> 08:32.130
Left, right, left.

08:42.130 --> 08:44.088
Auntie, let me help you.

08:45.671 --> 08:47.838
I'm sorry, your door was not locked.

08:47.921 --> 08:48.838
My bad.

08:48.921 --> 08:51.088
I always forget to lock the door.

08:51.171 --> 08:52.963
By the way,
this is my friend, Princess See.

08:53.046 --> 08:54.880
- Hello, Auntie.
- Hello.

08:54.963 --> 08:57.296
Gosh, I don't know how to use this.

08:58.421 --> 08:59.463
It's actually very simple.

08:59.546 --> 09:01.338
Come, let me help you.

09:01.421 --> 09:02.921
If you want this to go up,

09:03.005 --> 09:04.546
just tap the up button.

09:04.630 --> 09:05.838
It will just automatically go up.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.338
Then you can press this button to stop.

09:09.421 --> 09:10.880
If you want it to go down,

09:10.963 --> 09:12.338
you can press the down button.

09:14.296 --> 09:15.963
It's so simple.

09:16.046 --> 09:18.338
Damien just bought it yesterday.

09:19.380 --> 09:21.380
Auntie, is Damien at home?

09:22.171 --> 09:24.213
Damien already went out with his friend.

09:25.421 --> 09:26.588
Is it a girl?

09:31.255 --> 09:32.213
Do you want some water?

09:32.296 --> 09:33.671
- No.
- Yes, please.

09:34.296 --> 09:35.588
No, I don't want.

09:35.671 --> 09:36.963
It's okay.

09:37.046 --> 09:38.380
By the way, Auntie.

09:41.505 --> 09:43.713
Auntie, can you help me return this
to Damien, please?

09:44.505 --> 09:45.630
Okay.

09:47.338 --> 09:49.380
Auntie, we are going already. Bye.

09:49.463 --> 09:50.963
- Bye, Auntie. Take care, okay?
- Okay.

09:59.338 --> 10:01.171
Joey, are you okay?

10:03.046 --> 10:04.130
I'm okay.

10:09.796 --> 10:11.796
I'm finally okay！

10:11.880 --> 10:15.713
Joey, life doesn't start nor end with me.

10:15.796 --> 10:18.213
<i>All that we have shared
are moments I will never forget.</i>

10:18.296 --> 10:20.046
<i>But it is time to move on.</i>

10:21.546 --> 10:24.171
I never thought
that letting go is so easy.

10:24.255 --> 10:25.255
I feel so much better

10:25.338 --> 10:26.796
and I won't cry anymore.

10:28.755 --> 10:31.546
Joey, I am so proud of you.

11:04.796 --> 11:07.213
It's the Platoon Commander.

11:07.296 --> 11:09.546
Hello, ma'am?

11:09.630 --> 11:11.630
Yes, everything is okay.

11:13.421 --> 11:14.421
Thank you, ma'am.

11:15.463 --> 11:17.046
Yes, bye.

11:43.755 --> 11:46.255
- Faster, go shower.
- Everything is under control.

11:47.046 --> 11:48.505
Gosh, I am so tired.

11:48.588 --> 11:50.088
Luckily, we can book out tomorrow.

11:50.171 --> 11:51.671
I am so happy.

11:51.755 --> 11:53.046
Why are you not happy?

11:53.130 --> 11:54.588
Happy? Why should I be happy?

11:54.671 --> 11:56.296
When I did not book out
the last few weeks,

11:56.380 --> 11:57.296
the loan sharks couldn't find me.

11:57.380 --> 11:59.255
They will definitely find me tomorrow.

11:59.796 --> 12:02.171
Don't tell me you planned
all these confinements

12:02.255 --> 12:03.671
because you want to hide from loan sharks.

12:03.755 --> 12:04.671
Bloody hell.

12:04.755 --> 12:06.921
I am so stupid for accompanying you
all this while.

12:07.005 --> 12:08.171
Please don't say that.

12:08.255 --> 12:10.005
I am not like that.

12:10.088 --> 12:12.296
I want to ask you something serious.

12:12.380 --> 12:13.963
You have to tell me frankly, okay?

12:14.046 --> 12:15.588
- Okay?
- Okay.

12:16.546 --> 12:18.005
Do you have money to lend me?

12:19.005 --> 12:20.130
I don't have.

12:25.963 --> 12:27.171
Bye.

12:30.380 --> 12:33.213
- They really delivered it to you.
- Yes.

12:33.296 --> 12:34.463
Just a tap on the phone

12:34.546 --> 12:37.005
and they really deliver it
all the way to the camp.

12:37.088 --> 12:38.421
So convenient.

12:38.505 --> 12:41.005
I thought my daddy was lying,
but it's real.

12:42.421 --> 12:43.671
Hi, are you Ms. Monica Chng?

12:43.755 --> 12:45.713
- Yes, but not for you.
- I know.

12:45.796 --> 12:47.088
I am just here to deliver the car.

12:47.171 --> 12:48.463
Thank you.

12:48.546 --> 12:50.171
This car is certified pre-owned by us.

12:50.255 --> 12:51.546
Yes, my daddy already told me.

12:51.630 --> 12:53.588
Is the quality good or not?

12:53.671 --> 12:54.963
It's guaranteed to be good.

12:55.046 --> 12:56.671
I know about cars. Can we try it now?

12:56.755 --> 12:57.755
Please, by all means.

13:00.005 --> 13:01.505
I can finally book out.

13:01.588 --> 13:03.171
You must be a good person in the future.

13:03.255 --> 13:04.921
It's unbearable not being able
to book out.

13:05.005 --> 13:06.296
- I know.
- It's very unbearable, right?

13:06.380 --> 13:08.088
I also miss my daughter.

13:08.171 --> 13:09.255
Let me show you all.

13:13.838 --> 13:15.005
Really looks like her. Show her.

13:16.630 --> 13:17.671
Okay, I'll go.

13:18.630 --> 13:20.088
Good afternoon, Sergeant.

13:20.171 --> 13:21.463
Yes, Recruit Yuan?

13:21.546 --> 13:22.630
You see.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.796
You said I looked like your daughter.

13:27.880 --> 13:29.005
Do I look like your daughter?

13:29.630 --> 13:30.921
Your daughter?

13:31.005 --> 13:32.046
Yes.

13:32.130 --> 13:33.630
She really looks like me.

13:33.713 --> 13:35.088
Looks alike, right?

13:35.796 --> 13:37.880
Anyway, I just want to say

13:37.963 --> 13:40.630
I'm really sorry
about what I did to you last time.

13:40.713 --> 13:41.921
It's okay.

13:42.005 --> 13:43.588
You should let go and move on also.

13:43.671 --> 13:44.963
I have forgotten about it already.

13:45.046 --> 13:47.380
Thank you so much. Have a good weekend.

13:47.463 --> 13:48.546
Thank you, Sergeant.

13:49.255 --> 13:51.255
My family is here. See you.

13:52.338 --> 13:53.588
Bye.

13:53.671 --> 13:55.588
- Bye.
- Hold on. I have a question for you.

13:55.671 --> 13:56.963
Do you really have a gang?

14:00.838 --> 14:02.213
Actually, I do not have a gang.

14:02.296 --> 14:04.338
This is my husband and team.

14:04.421 --> 14:06.088
I am a member of Summit Planners.

14:06.171 --> 14:07.671
We don't only sell insurance.

14:07.755 --> 14:09.463
We also have ex-lawyers and ex-doctors.

14:09.546 --> 14:11.171
As long as you have any issues at home,

14:11.255 --> 14:13.463
we will have the solution for you
if you are our member.

14:13.546 --> 14:15.088
I think you should join us.

14:15.171 --> 14:17.130
- Why?
- Because what you are doing

14:17.213 --> 14:19.005
will land you in jail eventually.

14:20.130 --> 14:21.963
Consider it, Lan and Lian.

14:24.671 --> 14:26.255
Okay, let's go. Bye.

14:30.963 --> 14:32.880
Their gang is not bad.

14:32.963 --> 14:34.838
There are cars, money, and people.

14:34.921 --> 14:36.796
Let's not talk so much.
It's our first book out.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.838
Be happy. Don't you want to go home
and see your mother?

14:38.921 --> 14:40.421
I want to, but when I reach home,

14:40.505 --> 14:42.088
the loan sharks
will surely be waiting for me outside.

14:42.171 --> 14:43.380
Let's not go home and have fun.

14:43.463 --> 14:45.088
They will also find me.

14:45.171 --> 14:47.921
Singapore is so big.
How can they find you so easily?

14:48.005 --> 14:48.963
You won't understand.

14:49.046 --> 14:50.338
Taxi is here. Let's go.

14:50.421 --> 14:51.505
Stop thinking so much.

14:51.588 --> 14:53.005
Bye.

14:56.380 --> 14:57.463
Hi, Lian.

14:57.546 --> 14:59.213
Surprise.

14:59.296 --> 15:00.713
I respect the army.

15:00.796 --> 15:02.171
I don't want to quarrel
in front of the camp.

15:02.255 --> 15:03.588
There's no one here. Let's talk here.

15:03.671 --> 15:05.630
- Are you returning the money?
- Brother, please don't do this.

15:05.713 --> 15:07.463
This is none of your business.

15:07.546 --> 15:09.671
- Are you returning the money?
- Brother, I am in the army now.

15:09.755 --> 15:11.546
Wait until I'm done
and I will pay you back.

15:11.630 --> 15:13.463
Funeral? Pay with your bereavement money?

15:13.546 --> 15:15.421
Not that one,
but Operationally Ready Date.

15:15.505 --> 15:17.921
Cut the crap.
You can only leave if you pay.

15:18.005 --> 15:20.755
Brother, please do me a favor.

15:20.838 --> 15:21.921
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.755
Hello, can we help you?

15:31.838 --> 15:32.963
You can.

15:33.046 --> 15:34.296
McValue meal upsize.

15:34.380 --> 15:35.338
Iced Milo for my drink.

15:37.255 --> 15:38.546
Excuse me. How may I address you?

15:38.630 --> 15:40.338
- Mr. Ma.
- Mr. Ma.

15:40.421 --> 15:42.380
Please leave my friends alone.

15:42.463 --> 15:43.421
This is none of your business.

15:43.505 --> 15:44.796
They are my business.

15:44.880 --> 15:46.296
You are looking for trouble now.

15:46.380 --> 15:48.380
I am not intimidated by your size.

15:48.463 --> 15:51.671
But I do not fight women.

15:51.755 --> 15:52.796
It's okay, I like it.

15:54.046 --> 15:55.046
You like it?

15:55.130 --> 15:56.588
Let's give it to you then.

15:56.671 --> 15:57.588
Come on.

15:57.671 --> 15:58.588
Come on.

15:58.671 --> 16:00.921
She doesn't know what's coming.

16:06.255 --> 16:08.213
Sister, I'll let you off today.

16:08.296 --> 16:10.088
We do not hit women, okay?

16:10.171 --> 16:12.421
But someone has to settle her debts.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.255
I already told you I have no money.

16:14.338 --> 16:15.505
Then we have no choice.

16:16.755 --> 16:17.671
Excuse me.

16:17.755 --> 16:20.046
Mr. Plump, social distancing.

16:20.130 --> 16:22.505
Can we settle once and for all?

16:22.588 --> 16:24.380
Sure. Can you repay the 10,000 dollars?

16:24.463 --> 16:26.088
Not so much!
I only borrowed 6,000 dollars!

16:26.171 --> 16:27.005
What about interest?

16:27.088 --> 16:27.921
Don't worry, okay?

16:28.005 --> 16:28.921
It's okay. Don't worry.

16:29.005 --> 16:29.963
Everything is under control.

16:30.046 --> 16:31.088
Let me help you, okay?

16:31.171 --> 16:33.296
If money can settle it,
it's not a problem.

16:33.380 --> 16:35.380
The problem is she has no money.

16:35.463 --> 16:37.546
Mr. Plump, I have three things.

16:37.630 --> 16:38.588
One, cute.

16:38.671 --> 16:39.546
Two, pretty.

16:39.630 --> 16:41.171
Three, I have money.

16:41.255 --> 16:43.505
Can you give me your
account number or QR code?

16:43.588 --> 16:45.171
Are you sure?

16:45.255 --> 16:46.171
It's 10,000 dollars.

16:46.255 --> 16:49.046
Okay, yes. 10,000 dollars.

16:49.130 --> 16:51.546
Come, please scan.

16:58.255 --> 17:00.796
Is it 10,000 dollars in my account?

17:01.296 --> 17:02.546
Brother, can you double-confirm?

17:02.630 --> 17:04.130
It's 10,000 dollars, right?

17:08.005 --> 17:09.546
You're something.

17:09.630 --> 17:11.546
I like your decisiveness.

17:11.630 --> 17:14.296
The debt is settled today.

17:14.380 --> 17:15.838
Please do not bother her again.

17:15.921 --> 17:16.963
Of course, no problem.

17:17.046 --> 17:18.046
Let me tell you.

17:18.130 --> 17:19.088
If you need a loan,

17:19.171 --> 17:20.838
please look for me, Mr. Ma.

17:20.921 --> 17:23.088
Best interest rate in Singapore.

17:23.171 --> 17:25.171
- Remember to call me.
- Three, two, one.

17:25.255 --> 17:26.421
- Pah!
- Pah!

17:28.213 --> 17:29.880
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- Three, two, one.

17:29.963 --> 17:30.921
- Pah!
- Pah!

17:32.796 --> 17:34.130
It's okay, everything is settled already.

17:34.213 --> 17:35.088
You are so candid.

17:35.171 --> 17:37.088
Princess, you have really grown a lot.

17:37.880 --> 17:39.296
But I have one problem now.

17:39.380 --> 17:40.213
- What problem?
- What problem?

17:40.296 --> 17:42.671
The problem is my account is only left
with seven dollars.

17:42.755 --> 17:45.046
I am now hungry and I have no money.

17:45.130 --> 17:46.005
Wait.

17:46.088 --> 17:47.796
Wasn't that your father's money just now?

17:47.880 --> 17:50.796
That was my red packet money,
not my father's money.

17:50.880 --> 17:53.213
Princess, I swear
I will return you the money.

17:53.296 --> 17:54.171
It's okay.

17:54.255 --> 17:55.838
Don't worry, it's on me today.

17:55.921 --> 17:58.463
- Yes!
- Yes! Let's go!

17:58.546 --> 17:59.588
I want to eat sashimi.

17:59.671 --> 18:01.421
- Come.
- You want to eat sushi?

18:01.505 --> 18:02.671
It's my treat today, okay?

18:02.755 --> 18:03.880
So order whatever you want.

18:03.963 --> 18:05.921
- Thank you, Joey.
- Thank you.

18:06.005 --> 18:07.630
Let's scan first.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.088
- Send it to me.
- Have you guys seen the news?

18:11.171 --> 18:12.213
- What news?
- What news?

18:13.005 --> 18:14.421
<i>Thanks to a tip-off by the public,</i>

18:14.505 --> 18:17.296
<i>the police apprehended two suspects
two hours ago</i>

18:17.380 --> 18:18.963
<i>in an industrial building in the west</i>

18:19.046 --> 18:21.755
<i>who committed more than
five armed burglaries last week</i>

18:21.838 --> 18:23.463
<i>which resulted in casualties.</i>

18:23.546 --> 18:24.838
<i>As we understand,</i>

18:24.921 --> 18:26.713
<i>they have more accomplices
still on the run.</i>

18:26.796 --> 18:28.588
<i>As per the police's investigations,</i>

18:28.671 --> 18:31.296
they are a group of illegal immigrants

18:31.380 --> 18:34.296
<i>who trespassed into Singapore
by sea two weeks ago.</i>

18:34.380 --> 18:37.171
<i>Due to the fact that they may be armed,</i>

18:37.255 --> 18:39.671
the public is advised to be alert.

18:39.755 --> 18:41.213
If you see any suspicious people,

18:41.296 --> 18:42.963
inform the police immediately.

18:43.046 --> 18:44.671
- Illegal immigrants?
<i>- As reported.</i>

18:44.755 --> 18:46.546
Actually, how did they come to Singapore?

18:46.630 --> 18:47.546
Interesting.

18:47.630 --> 18:49.338
Idiots! Robbery in Singapore?

18:49.421 --> 18:51.421
If it's so easy,
I would have done it long ago.

18:51.505 --> 18:54.713
If it's like that, I must be careful
when I go home later.

18:54.796 --> 18:56.588
What if I meet them tonight?

18:56.671 --> 18:58.088
If they rob you,

18:58.171 --> 19:00.630
it means their intelligence report
is really good.

19:00.713 --> 19:02.088
- Why?
- Because robbing you

19:02.171 --> 19:03.588
is like robbing 50 others.

19:03.671 --> 19:04.838
What rubbish.

19:04.921 --> 19:06.296
But seriously,

19:06.380 --> 19:08.005
if there are intruders in your home,

19:08.088 --> 19:08.963
how would you react?

19:09.046 --> 19:10.671
I will stay and protect my family.

19:10.755 --> 19:11.588
Really?

19:11.671 --> 19:12.671
Are you just saying it?

19:12.755 --> 19:13.921
No, I am not kidding.

19:14.005 --> 19:15.088
For real.

19:15.171 --> 19:16.421
We are now soldiers.

19:16.505 --> 19:17.505
Let me ask you.

19:17.588 --> 19:19.421
War is happening all around the world.

19:19.505 --> 19:21.171
If another country comes and invades us,

19:21.255 --> 19:22.588
will you stay and protect our country?

19:22.671 --> 19:23.921
For me, I will fight.

19:24.005 --> 19:25.921
But I will pay someone to fight for me.

19:26.005 --> 19:27.421
How about you, Joey?

19:27.505 --> 19:30.630
Well, I really can't imagine
a war in Singapore.

19:30.713 --> 19:32.713
So I am not ready to answer.

19:32.796 --> 19:33.713
Amanda?

19:33.796 --> 19:35.588
For me, I will stay and I will fight

19:35.671 --> 19:37.338
and I will break all the invaders' faces.

19:40.838 --> 19:42.505
- Lan Lan?
- I will stay.

19:42.588 --> 19:43.463
So good?

19:43.546 --> 19:46.046
Because I don't know where to run,
so I will fight.

19:47.755 --> 19:49.046
For me, it depends.

19:49.130 --> 19:50.921
If I have the money, of course I will run.

19:51.005 --> 19:53.671
No money, no choice.
I will stay and fight.

19:53.755 --> 19:56.338
What about you? I am curious.

19:56.421 --> 19:57.630
Actually, I will stay and fight.

19:57.713 --> 19:58.921
I want to become an officer

19:59.005 --> 20:00.505
and lead my soldiers into war.

20:01.630 --> 20:03.755
- OCS!
- OCS!

20:03.838 --> 20:06.005
Really. If I were to give up my life
for the country,

20:06.088 --> 20:07.463
I will do it.

20:08.130 --> 20:11.213
- President scholar.
- President scholar.

20:11.296 --> 20:13.338
- Let's place our orders.
<i>- My father says that in the army,</i>

20:13.421 --> 20:15.963
<i>there are 10% positive and 10% negative.</i>

20:16.046 --> 20:18.296
<i>Why? Nobody knows.</i>

20:18.380 --> 20:19.546
<i>But it is like that.</i>

20:23.296 --> 20:24.546
<i>Good morning, Platoon 5.</i>

20:24.630 --> 20:26.213
- Good morning, Sergeant.
- Good morning, Sergeant.

20:26.296 --> 20:28.421
Today, we will be teaching you
a very important drill

20:28.505 --> 20:29.546
called CASEVAC

20:29.630 --> 20:31.338
which you might need to use
during wartime.

20:31.421 --> 20:33.463
So all of you better listen carefully.

20:33.546 --> 20:34.380
Is that clear?

20:34.463 --> 20:35.463
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Yes, Sergeant.

20:35.546 --> 20:36.463
Lieutenant Koh, sir.

20:36.546 --> 20:37.713
Please.

20:40.046 --> 20:42.171
- So handsome.
- So handsome.

20:42.255 --> 20:43.921
So handsome.

20:47.463 --> 20:48.380
Hi.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.838
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

20:53.546 --> 20:54.630
- How are you?
- Good.

20:54.713 --> 20:56.338
I feel very good already.

20:56.921 --> 20:57.755
Did you sleep well?

20:57.838 --> 20:59.338
- Yes.
- Yes.

20:59.421 --> 21:00.421
Sweet dreams?

21:00.505 --> 21:01.963
- Yes.
- Yes.

21:02.046 --> 21:03.296
Any nightmares?

21:03.380 --> 21:04.921
- You are my daydream.
- No, sir.

21:06.380 --> 21:07.588
Okay, thank you.

21:07.671 --> 21:11.255
But I guarantee you,
after today's training,

21:11.338 --> 21:13.338
all of you will have nightmares
about today.

21:14.005 --> 21:15.671
As your Platoon Sergeant mentioned,

21:15.755 --> 21:18.338
today, we are learning CASEVAC.

21:18.421 --> 21:21.255
CASEVAC stands for Casualty Evacuation.

21:21.338 --> 21:23.796
In a wartime scenario,
there may be fire fights.

21:24.671 --> 21:25.838
If that happens,

21:25.921 --> 21:27.338
there will be a lot of casualties

21:27.421 --> 21:29.338
and the medics may be overwhelmed.

21:29.421 --> 21:31.463
That will mean,
who has to help the injured?

21:31.546 --> 21:32.755
- Us.
- Us.

21:32.838 --> 21:33.838
That's right.

21:33.921 --> 21:36.796
So we will be demonstrating
a few techniques for you today.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.296
We have your lovely Lieutenant Chan

21:39.380 --> 21:41.005
and Sergeant Tok to demonstrate.

21:42.505 --> 21:43.963
So handsome.

21:50.546 --> 21:51.546
Handsome.

21:51.630 --> 21:53.171
Okay, listen up.

21:53.255 --> 21:55.880
The first technique we will be learning
is the fireman carry.

21:56.671 --> 21:58.171
The first step being,

21:58.255 --> 22:00.046
to place your hand on the wrist.

22:00.880 --> 22:03.713
Step two, the other hand
goes underneath the inner thigh.

22:09.546 --> 22:10.380
Lift.

22:14.421 --> 22:16.046
This is the preferred technique

22:16.130 --> 22:19.546
- because the weight is evenly distributed.
- He has big and powerful muscles.

22:19.630 --> 22:21.046
- Most…
- I know.

22:41.046 --> 22:42.630
Recruit Yuan Yuan Yuan.

22:43.505 --> 22:44.671
Is everything okay?

22:44.755 --> 22:47.255
- Yes. Okay, sir.
- Sure?

22:47.338 --> 22:49.005
- Yes? Okay.
- Yes, okay.

22:49.880 --> 22:52.421
Hey, I know what you are thinking.

22:52.505 --> 22:54.255
You're very naughty.

22:55.005 --> 22:56.171
Can't I even dream a little?

22:56.255 --> 22:58.755
Okay, with this technique,

22:58.838 --> 23:01.171
you can run further and faster

23:01.255 --> 23:03.588
as demonstrated
by your Section Commander in SBO.

23:10.338 --> 23:11.296
I can't see.

23:19.963 --> 23:21.046
Handsome.

23:22.171 --> 23:23.630
Sir, I have a question.

23:23.713 --> 23:24.546
Yes?

23:24.630 --> 23:26.588
What if the enemy starts firing?

23:26.671 --> 23:28.213
In this situation,

23:28.296 --> 23:29.713
drop the casualty and return fire.

23:30.296 --> 23:31.421
Alternatively,

23:31.505 --> 23:32.921
you don't have to put down the casualty

23:33.005 --> 23:35.630
while your platoon mates are around
to provide cover fire.

23:35.713 --> 23:37.005
This is teamwork.

23:37.088 --> 23:37.963
Is that clear?

23:38.046 --> 23:39.421
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Yes, Sergeant.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.088
All right, any questions?

23:41.171 --> 23:42.130
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

23:42.213 --> 23:43.255
If there are no questions,

23:43.338 --> 23:44.671
let's move on to the practical.

23:44.755 --> 23:46.755
But before we begin,

23:47.880 --> 23:49.921
I know today's training is very tough.

23:50.005 --> 23:52.171
Don't underestimate yourself.

23:52.255 --> 23:53.671
Do your best, okay?

23:53.755 --> 23:55.088
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

24:05.213 --> 24:06.463
Hurry up.

24:17.921 --> 24:18.963
Saddleback carry.

24:19.046 --> 24:21.213
Your weapon must always be in front sling.

24:21.296 --> 24:22.880
The hands will be across the neck.

24:23.380 --> 24:25.546
So when the carrier bends down and squats,

24:25.630 --> 24:28.338
this will allow him to generate more power
from the legs.

24:28.421 --> 24:29.338
Carry on.

24:30.296 --> 24:31.588
Like so.

24:31.671 --> 24:34.463
I also want to be piggybacked.

24:55.630 --> 24:57.463
Stop daydreaming.

24:57.546 --> 24:58.796
But actually, let me tell you,

24:58.880 --> 25:00.671
I think I have higher standards.

25:13.505 --> 25:14.838
Hey, it's too much.

25:16.213 --> 25:17.463
Does this look familiar to you?

25:17.546 --> 25:18.505
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

25:18.588 --> 25:20.546
Have you seen this
in the Korean dramas before?

25:20.630 --> 25:22.338
- Yes, sir.
- I love Korean dramas.

25:22.421 --> 25:24.171
I know because they copied us.

25:25.171 --> 25:26.338
Okay, please recover.

25:27.880 --> 25:29.255
Last but not least,

25:29.338 --> 25:30.838
we have the stretcher carry.

25:30.921 --> 25:33.546
It is very important
that you keep the stretcher level

25:33.630 --> 25:34.713
at all times.

25:34.796 --> 25:36.213
Two, six, up.

25:37.255 --> 25:39.171
Keep your back straight. Move out.

25:59.963 --> 26:01.546
Are you tired?

26:27.671 --> 26:29.755
Come on, keep going.

26:29.838 --> 26:31.130
Hurry up, come on.

26:31.213 --> 26:32.713
- Keep moving.
- Keep going.

26:32.796 --> 26:34.296
Hurry up.

26:34.380 --> 26:36.130
Keep going.

26:36.213 --> 26:37.630
Okay, Recruits.

26:37.713 --> 26:39.421
Put your stretchers down.

26:40.046 --> 26:40.921
Okay, get some rest.

26:41.005 --> 26:43.005
I know all of you are really tired, okay?

26:43.088 --> 26:45.380
But you need to be on cool down properly.

26:49.921 --> 26:51.838
- Hello.
- Recruits, get up.

26:51.921 --> 26:53.505
I know you all are tired,
but don't lie down on the grass.

26:53.588 --> 26:55.005
You, get up.

26:55.588 --> 26:56.880
Are you showing me that you are weak?

26:56.963 --> 26:58.713
- No, Sergeant.
- No, Sergeant.

26:58.796 --> 27:01.380
Section, are you all tired already?

27:01.463 --> 27:03.005
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

27:03.088 --> 27:05.380
We want to die already.

27:05.463 --> 27:07.338
Ma'am, this is so tiring.

27:07.421 --> 27:10.671
Ma'am, I think this training
is too difficult for us.

27:10.755 --> 27:14.171
Ma'am, I think God created women
with physical limitations.

27:14.255 --> 27:15.296
Carrying casualties?

27:15.380 --> 27:16.671
We really cannot.

27:16.755 --> 27:17.671
It's very tiring.

27:18.171 --> 27:20.296
- Yes.
- Agree.

27:20.380 --> 27:21.796
Let me tell you.

27:21.880 --> 27:25.088
This training is not just a matter
of physical strength.

27:25.171 --> 27:27.088
It's a matter of attitude.

27:27.171 --> 27:28.671
Imagine during wartime,

27:28.755 --> 27:30.838
your teammates are seriously injured.

27:30.921 --> 27:32.296
Are you willing to abandon them

27:32.796 --> 27:34.296
just because you think you are weak?

27:34.380 --> 27:35.755
- No, ma'am.
- No, ma'am.

27:35.838 --> 27:37.255
No.

27:37.338 --> 27:39.171
This training is to see

27:39.255 --> 27:40.921
how much you can endure here.

27:41.005 --> 27:43.088
It's not only about casualty carrying.

27:43.171 --> 27:45.255
- Understand?
- Yes, ma'am.

27:45.338 --> 27:47.463
But ma'am, every time I want to do it,

27:47.546 --> 27:48.713
my legs are very tired.

27:48.796 --> 27:49.921
What should I do?

27:50.005 --> 27:51.546
Ma'am, can you demonstrate to us

27:51.630 --> 27:55.171
how to carry a fireman and run
when you are very tired?

27:55.255 --> 27:56.088
Fireman?

27:56.171 --> 27:57.755
She meant fireman carry.

28:00.088 --> 28:01.380
Are you trying to challenge me?

28:01.963 --> 28:03.421
No, ma'am.

28:03.505 --> 28:05.046
Are you all trying to challenge me?

28:05.130 --> 28:06.338
- No, ma'am.
- No, ma'am.

28:06.421 --> 28:08.546
Recruits, I know
today's training is tough.

28:08.630 --> 28:11.713
But the field camp tomorrow
is going to be way tougher.

28:11.796 --> 28:13.005
Are you guys ready for it?

28:13.088 --> 28:14.505
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Yes, Sergeant.

28:14.588 --> 28:16.755
- I can't hear you.
- Yes, Sergeant.

28:16.838 --> 28:18.588
On your feet, up.

28:18.671 --> 28:20.713
- Hurry up.
- Why didn't she demonstrate it to us?

28:20.796 --> 28:22.463
I think she cannot do it too.

28:22.546 --> 28:23.505
Let's go.

28:28.005 --> 28:30.046
Recruits, have you had a good rest?

28:30.130 --> 28:31.546
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Yes, Sergeant.

28:31.630 --> 28:33.213
Anybody not feeling well?

28:33.880 --> 28:35.255
Anybody wants to report sick?

28:35.338 --> 28:36.338
Fall in there.

28:44.005 --> 28:45.296
Good.

28:45.380 --> 28:47.005
If you are not feeling well,

28:47.088 --> 28:48.255
you should report sick.

28:48.338 --> 28:49.921
I support you.

28:50.005 --> 28:52.046
You must take a very good rest.

28:52.130 --> 28:53.171
As you know,

28:53.255 --> 28:56.546
field camp is a very important training
for all recruits.

28:56.630 --> 28:58.171
And you should not miss it.

28:58.921 --> 29:00.296
But if you miss it,

29:00.380 --> 29:01.421
it's okay.

29:01.505 --> 29:04.213
We can always reschedule
a make-up course for you.

29:04.296 --> 29:07.380
Reschedule a make-up course for you.

29:08.546 --> 29:09.546
Sergeant Chow.

29:09.630 --> 29:10.588
Yes, ma'am.

29:10.671 --> 29:14.713
What about next Friday, Saturday,
Sunday, and Monday?

29:15.838 --> 29:17.921
- But Monday is a holiday.
- But Monday is a holiday.

29:18.005 --> 29:18.880
I know.

29:18.963 --> 29:20.338
So it won't interrupt other training.

29:20.421 --> 29:22.296
- Am I right?
- Sounds good, ma'am.

29:23.005 --> 29:24.838
I am going to give you guys
one last chance.

29:24.921 --> 29:27.296
If you are really sick,
go and report sick.

29:27.380 --> 29:28.796
But if you are not that sick,

29:28.880 --> 29:30.755
- I give you ten seconds to fall back in.
- Go.

29:30.838 --> 29:33.505
Ten, five, three, two, one.

29:34.963 --> 29:36.546
You have all become very healthy.

29:37.755 --> 29:39.463
Where's the report sick section?

29:39.546 --> 29:41.421
- No more, Sergeant.
- No more already?

29:42.963 --> 29:43.963
Bloody hell.

29:44.046 --> 29:45.505
Whole lot, knock it down now.

29:45.588 --> 29:46.921
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Yes, Sergeant.

29:47.630 --> 29:48.921
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

29:52.380 --> 29:53.963
- One, Sergeant.
- One, Sergeant.

29:54.046 --> 29:56.130
- Two, Sergeant.
- Two, Sergeant.

29:56.213 --> 29:59.796
<i>Field camp is an important training
for recruits.</i>

29:59.880 --> 30:02.505
<i>This is not a school holiday camp.</i>

30:02.588 --> 30:04.755
<i>We learn all the soldier fundamentals,</i>

30:04.838 --> 30:07.755
<i>so that we can fight properly "urine"…</i>

30:07.838 --> 30:10.671
<i>Sorry, I mean during wartime.</i>

30:11.296 --> 30:12.255
Move!

30:12.338 --> 30:13.213
Tents up!

30:13.296 --> 30:16.255
<i>We also learn how to build our bungalows</i>

30:16.338 --> 30:19.005
<i>and learn how to dig our own holes</i>

30:19.088 --> 30:20.255
<i>to protect ourselves.</i>

30:27.005 --> 30:28.005
Recruit Yuan Yuan.

30:28.088 --> 30:29.171
What is this?

30:29.255 --> 30:31.630
Yes, ma'am. This is my Presidential Suite.

30:31.713 --> 30:33.213
And what are you going to do with it?

30:34.338 --> 30:36.255
You see, it fits me just right.

30:38.546 --> 30:40.171
Enjoy your night here.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.796
Okay. Thank you, ma'am.

30:43.588 --> 30:45.338
- Recruit Lan Lan.
- Yes, ma'am.

30:45.421 --> 30:47.338
Your shell scrape must
be your body length.

30:47.421 --> 30:49.630
- What is this?
- Ma'am, this is my body length.

30:49.713 --> 30:50.671
Anything wrong?

30:50.755 --> 30:51.796
Do you think it's funny?

30:51.880 --> 30:52.838
No, ma'am.

30:52.921 --> 30:53.796
Is this okay?

30:53.880 --> 30:55.880
- Do you want confinement?
- No, ma'am.

30:55.963 --> 30:57.005
Bloody slacker!

30:57.088 --> 30:57.963
Redo it!

30:58.046 --> 30:58.963
Yes, ma'am.

31:04.213 --> 31:05.255
Good afternoon, Recruits.

31:05.338 --> 31:06.755
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon, sir.

31:06.838 --> 31:09.505
Right now, we will do
the Individual Field Craft session.

31:09.588 --> 31:12.130
In the jungle, when you run out
of combat rations to eat,

31:12.213 --> 31:14.588
that's when you will need to cook
in order to survive.

31:14.671 --> 31:15.755
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

31:15.838 --> 31:17.130
Before we go into practice,

31:17.213 --> 31:19.130
your Platoon Sergeant
has something for you all.

31:19.213 --> 31:21.630
Last week, your performance was amazing.

31:21.713 --> 31:24.380
So I prepared something for you guys
to add to your instant noodles.

31:28.713 --> 31:30.630
<i>If our performance is good,</i>

31:30.713 --> 31:33.255
<i>Sergeant Chow will give us some rewards.</i>

31:33.338 --> 31:35.255
<i>Even just a simple egg</i>

31:35.338 --> 31:38.046
<i>can make us happy for a whole day.</i>

31:39.088 --> 31:40.880
<i>To us, field camp means</i>

31:40.963 --> 31:43.880
<i>to cook, eat, and sleep outside</i>

31:43.963 --> 31:45.463
<i>and no bowel movement for four days.</i>

31:48.963 --> 31:51.588
<i>We also don't shower for four days.</i>

31:51.671 --> 31:54.255
<i>Every night, we worry
the Sergeant will still our rifle.</i>

31:54.338 --> 31:56.505
- Does this look okay to you?
- I think so, Sergeant.

31:56.588 --> 31:59.755
<i>We hate the weather
and pray for CAT 1 every day.</i>

31:59.838 --> 32:02.880
<i>And I really miss my bed
and air conditioner.</i>

32:13.380 --> 32:14.380
Section 2.

32:14.880 --> 32:16.546
I know it has been a tiring day,

32:16.630 --> 32:18.630
so please rest early tonight.

32:18.713 --> 32:20.921
Because tomorrow,
the training will be tougher.

32:21.005 --> 32:21.838
Is that clear?

32:21.921 --> 32:23.255
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Yes, Sergeant.

32:23.338 --> 32:24.838
Who's doing sentry today?

32:24.921 --> 32:26.296
Recruit Fatimah, Sergeant.

32:26.380 --> 32:27.380
Recruit Amanda, Sergeant.

32:27.463 --> 32:28.380
Good.

32:28.463 --> 32:29.963
You guys know what you're supposed to do?

32:30.046 --> 32:31.421
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Carry on.

32:32.838 --> 32:33.963
Section 2.

32:34.046 --> 32:35.588
Let me remind all of you.

32:35.671 --> 32:37.088
You are supposed to sleep

32:37.171 --> 32:38.505
with your uniforms on.

32:38.588 --> 32:39.463
Understand?

32:39.546 --> 32:40.755
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Yes, Sergeant.

32:40.838 --> 32:43.630
Also, no chit-chatting and no lights on.

32:43.713 --> 32:45.463
If I catch any of you doing that,

32:45.546 --> 32:48.005
I will make you do sentry duty
the whole night.

32:48.088 --> 32:48.921
Is that clear?

32:49.005 --> 32:50.380
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Yes, Sergeant.

32:50.463 --> 32:51.505
Okay.

32:51.588 --> 32:52.921
Section 2, good night.

32:53.005 --> 32:55.130
- Good night, Sergeant.
- Good night, Sergeant.

33:21.338 --> 33:22.671
It's very hot.

33:28.505 --> 33:29.463
Are you sleeping naked?

33:29.546 --> 33:31.171
Yes, I am. How do you know?

33:31.255 --> 33:32.171
Because I am too.

33:33.005 --> 33:34.380
- Joking.
- Kidding.

33:35.130 --> 33:37.588
Sergeant is not here. Sit up.

33:44.463 --> 33:45.963
Why did you bring your phone?

33:46.046 --> 33:47.421
It's a chargeable offense.

33:47.505 --> 33:48.963
How did you get past the inspection?

33:49.046 --> 33:50.755
I put it somewhere they can't search.

33:50.838 --> 33:52.296
Where did you hide it?

33:52.380 --> 33:53.755
My bra.

33:55.755 --> 33:57.130
I cannot.

33:57.213 --> 33:58.213
I know.

34:00.255 --> 34:01.630
Where's our food?

34:03.963 --> 34:06.171
It's on the way.

34:06.255 --> 34:08.005
- Yes.
- Yes.

34:08.088 --> 34:09.796
Don't say that I didn't warn you.

34:09.880 --> 34:12.005
Sergeant might just
be pretending to sleep.

34:12.088 --> 34:13.463
He might come and do a spot-check.

34:13.546 --> 34:15.255
Didn't you all watch <i>Ah Boys to Men</i>?

34:15.338 --> 34:17.296
The Sergeant might come
in the middle of the night

34:17.380 --> 34:18.463
to steal your rifle.

34:18.546 --> 34:19.505
Yes.

34:23.630 --> 34:25.380
- Someone is here.
- Go.

34:32.296 --> 34:33.921
Amanda.

34:34.005 --> 34:35.546
- What?
- Did you see that?

34:35.630 --> 34:36.546
See what?

34:36.630 --> 34:38.088
- You didn't see anything?
- No.

34:39.005 --> 34:41.005
- Don't scare me.
- What are you talking about?

34:41.796 --> 34:42.630
Never mind.

34:42.713 --> 34:44.755
- Can I hold your hand?
- Yes, sure.

34:44.838 --> 34:45.963
Let's go.

34:46.046 --> 34:48.546
Don't worry, if anyone bullies you,
I will break their faces.

34:48.630 --> 34:49.963
<i>My father said,</i>

34:50.046 --> 34:53.963
<i>last time, no matter how remote
the training area was,</i>

34:54.046 --> 34:58.505
<i>you can surely see some uncles
and aunties selling food there.</i>

34:58.588 --> 35:01.338
<i>Now, there are no more uncles and aunties.</i>

35:01.421 --> 35:03.880
<i>But we can still get our food</i>

35:03.963 --> 35:06.255
<i>when we are deep in the jungle.</i>

35:06.338 --> 35:07.713
<i>Do you know why?</i>

35:12.338 --> 35:14.755
Is there anybody by the name

35:14.838 --> 35:16.380
of Yuan Yuan Yuan?

35:20.046 --> 35:21.046
Brother.

35:21.130 --> 35:23.338
I am in the jungle
in the middle of nowhere.

35:23.421 --> 35:24.671
You can still find me?

35:24.755 --> 35:26.421
Of course.

35:26.505 --> 35:28.588
This is our service.

35:29.255 --> 35:30.838
But bro, why are you wearing this?

35:31.630 --> 35:33.880
This? I don't want to get caught,

35:33.963 --> 35:36.380
so I am also using tactical movement.

35:36.463 --> 35:39.171
You know tactical movement too?

35:39.255 --> 35:40.880
- Of course.
- Then where's your uniform?

35:45.005 --> 35:46.171
Good.

35:46.255 --> 35:47.630
Girls, food is here.

35:47.713 --> 35:49.880
- All right.
- Gather.

35:49.963 --> 35:51.171
Come.

36:00.588 --> 36:02.546
Here you go, open up.

36:02.630 --> 36:03.880
Impressive.

36:04.880 --> 36:06.421
Keep it down.

36:06.505 --> 36:08.505
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you, ma'am.

36:08.588 --> 36:09.880
Just eat more, okay?

36:09.963 --> 36:11.463
Abalone.

36:15.338 --> 36:16.213
Bro.

36:17.338 --> 36:18.505
Don't tell anybody.

36:19.630 --> 36:21.421
I won't tell anybody.

36:23.046 --> 36:24.088
Thanks.

36:24.171 --> 36:26.463
Bro, when you go out on tactical movement,

36:26.546 --> 36:27.421
turn to your right.

36:27.505 --> 36:29.005
- Okay.
- Don't turn left.

36:29.088 --> 36:30.380
All the recruits are there. Turn right.

36:30.463 --> 36:31.338
Okay, can.

36:31.421 --> 36:33.463
- Thank you.
- Take care.

36:33.546 --> 36:34.463
Thanks.

36:38.463 --> 36:40.130
Quiet. Don't let the Recruits hear.

36:40.213 --> 36:42.630
<i>Now is also tactical movement, okay?
Understand?</i>

36:42.713 --> 36:43.671
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

36:46.338 --> 36:48.630
<i>That's all for our five-day field camp.</i>

36:48.713 --> 36:50.880
<i>It was very tough, but we learned a lot.</i>

36:50.963 --> 36:54.880
<i>And I think we are ready
for our two big tests coming up.</i>

36:54.963 --> 36:57.880
<i>The Basic Military Training test
and Situational test.</i>

36:57.963 --> 36:59.588
<i>The BMT test will test</i>

36:59.671 --> 37:03.005
<i>what we learned so far
from all the basic training</i>

37:03.088 --> 37:06.755
<i>and the SIT test will test our leadership.</i>

37:19.005 --> 37:19.963
Come in.

37:22.463 --> 37:23.588
Take a seat.

37:23.671 --> 37:24.838
Thank you, ma'am.

37:26.838 --> 37:28.130
How are you feeling?

37:28.213 --> 37:29.463
I am feeling much better, ma'am.

37:29.546 --> 37:30.630
That's good.

37:30.713 --> 37:32.588
I can see the improvement in you.

37:32.671 --> 37:35.588
You're more focused
and more willing to take initiative.

37:36.713 --> 37:38.213
As for your relationship…

37:39.005 --> 37:40.130
Don't worry, ma'am.

37:40.213 --> 37:41.546
I have already gotten over him.

37:41.630 --> 37:42.630
Plus, like what you said,

37:42.713 --> 37:43.671
he's not worth it.

37:43.755 --> 37:45.130
I have already broken up with him.

37:45.213 --> 37:46.213
That's right.

37:47.046 --> 37:49.671
Sometimes, in order for us
to meet the right guy,

37:49.755 --> 37:52.546
we need to meet a few wrong guys
along the way.

37:52.630 --> 37:53.880
That's part and parcel of life.

37:53.963 --> 37:54.880
Do you get it?

37:54.963 --> 37:57.130
Do you have other problems?

38:01.463 --> 38:04.255
About training or your bunkmates?

38:05.838 --> 38:07.046
Joey?

38:08.046 --> 38:09.380
Yes, ma'am.

38:10.213 --> 38:12.088
Do you have anything you want to ask me

38:12.171 --> 38:13.421
or talk to me about?

38:16.838 --> 38:18.671
- No, ma'am.
- Okay.

38:18.755 --> 38:20.005
Then you may leave now

38:20.088 --> 38:23.171
and remember, I am always with you.

38:25.713 --> 38:26.630
Thanks, ma'am.

38:37.255 --> 38:38.296
Yes?

38:39.380 --> 38:40.713
Nothing, ma'am.

38:56.546 --> 38:58.088
This is what he looks like.

38:58.921 --> 39:00.421
What is ma'am's name?

39:00.505 --> 39:01.463
- Roxanne.
- Roxanne.

39:03.088 --> 39:05.380
But there are so many Roxannes.

39:05.463 --> 39:06.755
Ma'am is a very private person.

39:06.838 --> 39:07.963
She will change her name.

39:08.046 --> 39:08.880
I know.

39:08.963 --> 39:10.296
I think you can search for Madam Tan.

39:10.380 --> 39:11.255
Madam Tan？

39:11.338 --> 39:13.880
- Roxanne with double X.
- With double X.

39:17.171 --> 39:20.005
I think this is her,
but she is alone in the picture.

39:20.088 --> 39:22.380
Never mind, we can search Instagram.

39:25.588 --> 39:27.005
She's with someone.

39:27.088 --> 39:28.338
But it's private though.

39:28.421 --> 39:30.005
- We can't see.
- It's okay.

39:30.088 --> 39:31.463
I have never tried this before,

39:31.546 --> 39:32.671
but let me zoom in.

39:39.546 --> 39:41.171
- It's him!
- It's him!

39:42.005 --> 39:42.921
Bitch!

39:44.296 --> 39:46.046
MMA stands for Mixed Martial Arts

39:46.130 --> 39:49.838
which involves boxing, jujitsu
and Muay Thai.

39:50.921 --> 39:52.088
In the event of war,

39:52.171 --> 39:54.046
you will face all kinds of situations

39:54.130 --> 39:55.588
which includes unarmed combat.

39:57.005 --> 40:00.713
That's why you all need
to learn MMA to fight.

40:00.796 --> 40:02.796
Fight for your life.

40:03.921 --> 40:05.213
I am Sergeant Ho.

40:05.296 --> 40:07.671
- Good morning, Sergeant Ho.
- Good morning, Sergeant Ho.

40:07.755 --> 40:08.588
This is Sergeant Tan.

40:08.671 --> 40:11.338
Hulk Tan!

40:15.671 --> 40:17.671
And now, we are going to demonstrate

40:17.755 --> 40:18.671
a series of moves.

40:19.546 --> 40:21.755
Number one, boxing.

40:26.505 --> 40:27.505
Was that too fast for you guys?

40:27.588 --> 40:28.588
- Yes.
- Yes.

40:28.671 --> 40:30.713
We will demonstrate it in slow motion
for you guys.

40:34.963 --> 40:36.338
Always go for the face.

40:36.421 --> 40:38.796
This is the weakest part of a man's face.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.713
Remember.

40:44.880 --> 40:46.505
And for the second move,

40:46.588 --> 40:47.880
Muay Thai.

40:47.963 --> 40:49.755
Always use the elbow to attack

40:49.838 --> 40:51.421
and the shin for defense.

40:54.796 --> 40:57.338
Head.

40:57.421 --> 40:59.463
Aim for the head.

41:00.213 --> 41:01.588
Always aim for the head.

41:02.296 --> 41:04.880
At this point, he should be concussed.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.671
Otherwise, you use your final move

41:07.755 --> 41:09.088
which is jujitsu.

41:16.296 --> 41:18.296
And if all of these don't work,

41:19.213 --> 41:20.671
you have one secret move.

41:20.755 --> 41:21.796
Do you know what it is?

41:21.880 --> 41:23.546
- No.
- No.

41:23.630 --> 41:24.505
- Run.
- Run.

41:26.588 --> 41:27.838
- Run.
- Run.

41:27.921 --> 41:28.880
I know this too.

41:28.963 --> 41:30.588
Okay. Thank you, Sergeant Tan.

41:30.671 --> 41:33.713
- Thank you, Sergeant Tan.
- Thank you, Sergeant Tan.

41:35.088 --> 41:38.255
And now, I would like to invite
another demonstrator.

41:38.338 --> 41:40.005
She's very well-trained in MMA combat.

41:40.088 --> 41:41.671
She's none other than your PC.

41:43.380 --> 41:44.796
Hi, Section 2.

41:44.880 --> 41:46.255
- Is this the best that you can do?
- What's going on?

41:46.338 --> 41:47.171
- Come.
- Hi.

41:48.130 --> 41:49.755
Are you all surprised that I am here?

41:49.838 --> 41:52.796
Yes, I have been doing MMA for many years.

41:52.880 --> 41:55.213
I am not sure if anyone is experienced.

41:55.296 --> 41:57.171
But are there any volunteers?

41:57.255 --> 41:58.296
Yes, any volunteers?

41:58.380 --> 41:59.671
You?

41:59.755 --> 42:01.463
- Come on. Anyone？
- You want to fight?

42:02.421 --> 42:04.505
Sergeant, she's very good.

42:04.588 --> 42:10.880
- Joey.
- Joey.

42:10.963 --> 42:12.671
- Joey.
- Okay, Recruit Joey.

42:12.755 --> 42:14.546
- Joey!
- Go!

42:18.088 --> 42:20.005
- Joey!
- Joey!

42:20.088 --> 42:21.630
Joey, go!

42:25.796 --> 42:28.421
- Joey, go!
- Joey, go!

42:28.505 --> 42:29.838
Joey, what's wrong with you?

42:29.921 --> 42:30.796
Are you okay?

42:30.880 --> 42:33.046
Joey, go!

42:35.380 --> 42:36.963
Joey!

42:37.046 --> 42:38.171
Go!

42:42.255 --> 42:44.213
Stop.

42:45.463 --> 42:46.630
Ma'am, are you okay?

42:46.713 --> 42:47.838
What's going on here?

42:47.921 --> 42:48.921
What's wrong with you?

43:00.171 --> 43:01.838
Damien gave this to you?

43:03.713 --> 43:04.713
Yes.

43:05.505 --> 43:06.796
Damien gave this to you too?

43:07.713 --> 43:08.921
Yes.

43:10.588 --> 43:11.921
How did you know him?

43:12.005 --> 43:13.046
One year ago,

43:13.130 --> 43:14.755
we met during our friend's birthday.

43:16.380 --> 43:18.130
So you thought that I was the one

43:18.213 --> 43:19.755
who broke you and Damien up?

43:19.838 --> 43:21.171
And that's why just now…

43:21.255 --> 43:22.588
Yes, initially.

43:22.671 --> 43:24.921
But I am all over Damien already.

43:25.005 --> 43:26.505
But when I first knew
that you were the one

43:26.588 --> 43:28.171
who came in between us…

43:28.255 --> 43:30.255
I am sorry,
it was too much for me to take.

43:30.338 --> 43:31.755
Ma'am, I am sorry for attacking you.

43:31.838 --> 43:33.005
No.

43:33.088 --> 43:35.963
I am not the one
who came in between you and Damien.

43:36.046 --> 43:37.255
I am not the mistress.

43:38.755 --> 43:40.963
I have been with him
for three years already

43:41.046 --> 43:42.505
since our school days.

43:42.588 --> 43:44.046
What?

43:44.130 --> 43:46.005
He was really nice to me.

43:46.088 --> 43:47.588
I trusted him so much.

43:47.671 --> 43:49.838
I never thought he would cheat on me.

43:51.380 --> 43:53.755
See. Look at the date.

44:01.088 --> 44:01.963
Ma'am.

44:02.963 --> 44:04.505
Judging by what you just showed me,

44:04.588 --> 44:06.296
it means I am the third party.

44:07.171 --> 44:08.546
In a way, yes.

44:08.630 --> 44:09.921
But no.

44:10.005 --> 44:11.588
We are just the victims.

44:11.671 --> 44:13.171
We are not to blame.

44:13.255 --> 44:14.588
But he is.

44:15.505 --> 44:19.130
Ma'am, I am so confused now.

44:19.213 --> 44:20.255
What should we do?

44:20.338 --> 44:21.713
Don't worry.

44:21.796 --> 44:23.505
Everything is under control.

44:25.963 --> 44:27.088
I know what to do.

46:01.088 --> 46:04.213
Recruits, we are going
to do our equipment check.

46:04.296 --> 46:06.380
First up, muzzle, check.

46:06.463 --> 46:07.630
- Check.
- Check.

46:07.713 --> 46:08.963
Charging handle, check.

46:09.046 --> 46:10.255
- Check.
- Check.

46:10.338 --> 46:12.088
- Magazine, check.
- Check.

46:12.171 --> 46:13.838
Okay, bags off.

46:19.588 --> 46:20.671
Okay, Recruits

46:21.421 --> 46:24.713
Another 5 km
and we will reach our ending point.

46:26.088 --> 46:28.546
I know it's hot. I know it's tough.

46:28.630 --> 46:30.296
But don't ever give up.

46:30.963 --> 46:33.921
Tell yourself that you can do this.

46:35.130 --> 46:36.755
So what if the road is long?

46:37.630 --> 46:40.130
There's no road
that can never be conquered.

46:41.088 --> 46:42.213
Is that clear?

46:42.296 --> 46:43.255
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

46:43.338 --> 46:45.505
Platoon Sergeant, carry on.

46:45.588 --> 46:46.755
Yes, ma'am.

46:46.838 --> 46:47.880
All right, ladies.

46:47.963 --> 46:49.921
We are going to do
our water parade right now.

46:50.005 --> 46:50.880
Bottles up.

46:57.755 --> 46:59.963
- Caps off.
- Caps off.

47:00.546 --> 47:02.755
Half-full water bottle, drink up.

47:02.838 --> 47:04.255
- Drink up.
- Drink up.

47:07.588 --> 47:08.588
Caps on.

47:09.171 --> 47:10.255
- Caps on.
- Caps on.

47:10.963 --> 47:12.130
Bottles down.

47:12.213 --> 47:13.255
- Bottles down.
- Bottles down.

47:14.671 --> 47:16.880
Recruits, we're going to take five.

47:24.588 --> 47:26.546
Recruits, if you want
to fill up your bottle,

47:26.630 --> 47:27.963
please line up.

47:29.296 --> 47:30.713
Carry on.

47:30.796 --> 47:31.796
Here.

47:31.880 --> 47:33.338
Carry on.

47:36.921 --> 47:38.380
Look at our PC.

47:38.463 --> 47:39.755
She has the same problems as you,

47:39.838 --> 47:41.088
but she looks powerful.

47:41.171 --> 47:42.963
She can take it very well.

47:43.046 --> 47:45.088
She has no tears when she cries. You see?

47:45.171 --> 47:46.463
I really should learn from her.

47:46.546 --> 47:48.380
But let me tell you,
she is definitely very sad.

47:48.463 --> 47:51.213
Of course, she is human too.

47:51.296 --> 47:54.130
She can pick up and let go very easily.

47:54.213 --> 47:55.755
We must learn from her.

47:55.838 --> 47:57.713
Steady, okay?

48:41.505 --> 48:42.505
Hi, dear.

48:42.588 --> 48:43.755
It's your birthday today

48:43.838 --> 48:45.630
<i>and I would like to celebrate with you</i>

48:45.713 --> 48:46.880
<i>as I promised earlier.</i>

48:46.963 --> 48:48.421
Okay.

48:48.505 --> 48:51.005
What about 8 p.m. tonight?

48:51.088 --> 48:52.338
Yes, 8 p.m. is fine.

48:52.421 --> 48:53.796
So sweet of you.

48:53.880 --> 48:55.713
I will text you the address later.

48:56.963 --> 48:58.130
Where are you now?

48:58.213 --> 48:59.505
I'm at the gym, exercising.

48:59.588 --> 49:00.671
Really?

49:00.755 --> 49:02.005
Dear?

49:02.088 --> 49:03.796
- Dear?
- Sorry, I need to go to training now.

49:03.880 --> 49:04.755
Bye.

49:04.838 --> 49:07.005
Babe, who were you talking to?

49:07.088 --> 49:08.338
- My sister.
- Really?

49:24.713 --> 49:26.255
Hi, Recruit Joey.

49:32.588 --> 49:33.630
Dear.

49:33.713 --> 49:35.880
Thank you so much for bringing me
to such a grand place

49:35.963 --> 49:37.380
to celebrate my birthday.

49:37.463 --> 49:38.880
It's my pleasure.

49:38.963 --> 49:40.213
You deserve it.

49:40.796 --> 49:41.671
Really?

49:41.755 --> 49:43.296
Good evening, sir.

49:43.380 --> 49:44.713
I believe this is your cake.

49:45.963 --> 49:47.755
You look really familiar.

49:49.963 --> 49:51.005
Happy birthday.

49:51.088 --> 49:52.130
Enjoy your evening.

49:52.213 --> 49:53.588
Thank you.

49:55.171 --> 49:58.088
Thank you for preparing
such a beautiful cake for me.

49:58.171 --> 49:59.380
Because you deserve it.

49:59.463 --> 50:00.505
Make a wish.

50:00.588 --> 50:01.588
Okay.

50:15.005 --> 50:16.463
What happened, dear?

50:18.046 --> 50:19.255
Why…

50:19.963 --> 50:20.880
You…

50:22.130 --> 50:23.005
Why are you here?

50:23.088 --> 50:24.546
Surprise.

50:24.630 --> 50:26.130
What's going on? Why--

50:26.213 --> 50:28.130
Why are you doing this to me?

50:28.213 --> 50:29.880
- You deserve it!
- You deserve it!

50:29.963 --> 50:31.588
And one more for you!

50:35.463 --> 50:38.296
<i>Everywhere we go</i>

50:38.380 --> 50:40.880
<i>- People want to know</i>
<i>- People want to know</i>

50:40.963 --> 50:43.796

51:00.005 --> 51:00.921

<i>- No, sweat</i>

51:03.130 --> 51:04.421

<i>- Bravo</i>

51:04.505 --> 51:06.046
Thanks for coming, ladies.

51:06.130 --> 51:07.463
Let's go.

51:07.546 --> 51:10.005
<i>- Everywhere we go</i>
<i>- Everywhere we go</i>

51:10.088 --> 51:12.505

51:29.380 --> 51:30.546
<i>Platoon 5.</i>

51:30.630 --> 51:33.296
<i>Today is the start of your BMT Test.</i>

51:33.380 --> 51:36.338
<i>This is a very important test for recruits</i>

51:36.421 --> 51:40.255
<i>to test all that you have learned
during the last two months.</i>

52:18.255 --> 52:19.421
Group 3, move.

52:29.213 --> 52:30.255
Stop!

52:30.338 --> 52:33.296
You die.

52:33.380 --> 52:34.338
- Why?
- Why?

52:34.421 --> 52:36.130
The enemy is firing.

52:36.213 --> 52:37.796
You have no cover fire

52:37.880 --> 52:39.505
and none of you took cover.

52:40.046 --> 52:41.588
- We'll take cover now.
- We'll take cover now.

52:41.671 --> 52:42.838
Don't give me this bullshit.

52:42.921 --> 52:43.838
No human shields.

52:43.921 --> 52:44.921
You all die. Squat.

52:45.005 --> 52:46.380
- Why?
- But…

52:46.463 --> 52:49.463
- Where is the BMT test Section Commander?
- Seriously.

52:49.546 --> 52:51.630
Me, sir. Recruit Kamala.

52:51.713 --> 52:53.338
Recruit Kamala.

52:53.421 --> 52:56.255
Your entire Group 3 is all down.

52:56.338 --> 52:58.546
- Do you know why?
- No, sir.

52:58.630 --> 53:00.130
They didn't take cover.

53:00.213 --> 53:01.380
They walked through the forest

53:01.463 --> 53:03.005
like their grandfather owned it.

53:03.088 --> 53:05.713
Like you're going to buy bubble tea
at Plaza Singapura.

53:05.796 --> 53:08.963
Why is your tactical movement
as flimsy as my cuttlefish?

53:09.630 --> 53:11.713
You didn't take care of your men.

53:11.796 --> 53:13.546
So how? You have four down

53:13.630 --> 53:15.255
and 11 men left.

53:15.338 --> 53:16.921
How are you going to fulfill your mission?

53:17.005 --> 53:18.546
I have a plan, sir.

53:19.130 --> 53:21.046
Okay, let's hear your plan.

53:21.130 --> 53:22.380
Yes, sir.

53:22.463 --> 53:23.463
Bee Bee, come here.

53:25.838 --> 53:26.755
I have a plan.

53:26.838 --> 53:28.005
- Standing and talking?
- Come.

53:28.088 --> 53:29.630
Do you think the enemy can't see you?

53:30.338 --> 53:33.380
Okay, I need your team
to do the right flanking.

53:33.463 --> 53:35.046
Over there, okay?

53:35.130 --> 53:36.713
I need you to send two of your teammates

53:36.796 --> 53:38.796
to do a recce of the road in advance

53:38.880 --> 53:41.130
to make sure the terrain is good and safe.

53:41.213 --> 53:42.671
- It's Christmas already.
- We cannot die.

53:42.755 --> 53:44.755
- We cannot die, okay? Go.
- Okay.

53:44.838 --> 53:46.505
Now you're falling down.

53:46.588 --> 53:48.588
Run.

53:57.505 --> 53:58.380
Bloody hell.

53:58.463 --> 54:00.630
My grandmother is lying
in her bloody coffin

54:00.713 --> 54:02.505
and she can run faster than you.

54:03.588 --> 54:04.546
IC.

54:05.255 --> 54:06.921
- Thank you.
- For what?

54:07.005 --> 54:10.005
You made us die, so that we can rest.

54:10.088 --> 54:12.088
I take that as a compliment.

54:23.463 --> 54:25.130
Okay, this is definitely fine.

54:25.213 --> 54:26.963
Definitely okay.

54:29.588 --> 54:30.838
Where's the road?

54:30.921 --> 54:31.796
There is.

54:31.880 --> 54:33.546
Don't worry, everything is under control.

54:33.630 --> 54:34.630
There's no route now.

54:34.713 --> 54:36.921
Later when we walk in, it will appear.

54:37.005 --> 54:40.046
Recruits, are you all blind or crazy?

54:40.130 --> 54:41.755
This is a bloody muddy place.

54:42.380 --> 54:45.213
The moment your leg goes in,
it will definitely not come out.

54:45.296 --> 54:47.671
You will bring the whole section
to their deaths.

54:47.755 --> 54:49.171
Are you sure about that?

54:49.255 --> 54:50.921
But anyway, this is your test.

54:51.005 --> 54:51.921
It's up to you.

54:53.463 --> 54:54.880
Don't go. Do you know why?

54:55.755 --> 54:57.630
I just got out of a muddy place.

54:57.713 --> 54:59.421
I don't want to go back in anymore.

54:59.505 --> 55:01.463
You have a point. Let's go.

55:19.463 --> 55:20.338
Wait.

55:20.421 --> 55:21.755
Let me tell you guys something.

55:21.838 --> 55:23.421
I have been in the army for so long

55:23.505 --> 55:25.505
and I have never seen
such field signals before

55:25.588 --> 55:27.130
and you expect your buddy to understand?

55:27.213 --> 55:28.755
Yes, sir. I understand.

55:28.838 --> 55:30.505
Is it? Okay, very good.

55:30.588 --> 55:32.755
The three of you tell me what it is.
One, two, three.

55:32.838 --> 55:35.213
- Muddy place, leg go in, cannot come out.
- Muddy place, leg go in, cannot come out.

55:35.963 --> 55:37.046
What the hell?

55:37.130 --> 55:39.130
Okay, very good.

55:39.213 --> 55:41.755
But you know that this is not
the proper field signals, right?

55:41.838 --> 55:44.005
So you all shouldn't use it.
Is that clear?

55:44.088 --> 55:45.046
Yes, sir. We understand.

55:45.130 --> 55:46.671
But army field signals
are not enough for us to use.

55:46.755 --> 55:49.046
But if you need to, you can improvise.

55:49.130 --> 55:51.505
Just make sure you understand the signals
between one another.

55:51.588 --> 55:53.130
That's why we improvised.

55:53.213 --> 55:54.338
This is what we learned, sir.

55:55.588 --> 55:57.380
Okay, true.

55:57.463 --> 55:58.796
Okay, you carry on.

55:58.880 --> 56:02.296
<i>Amazing! How is he an instructor
when he doesn't know this?</i>

56:04.755 --> 56:06.546
Kamala, we can't go that way.

56:06.630 --> 56:08.046
The terrain is dangerous.

56:08.130 --> 56:10.713
Muddy, legs go in, cannot come out.

56:10.796 --> 56:11.921
It's okay.

56:12.005 --> 56:12.838
Change of plans.

56:12.921 --> 56:14.046
We don't go right.

56:14.130 --> 56:15.671
<i>- We'll go left.
- Okay.</i>

56:15.755 --> 56:17.338
<i>But I need your team to leopard crawl</i>

56:17.421 --> 56:18.880
<i>from there to there.</i>

56:18.963 --> 56:20.463
<i>Make sure the enemy doesn't see you all.</i>

56:20.546 --> 56:23.005
<i>And once you reach there,
give me a signal.</i>

56:23.088 --> 56:24.296
<i>My team will cover fire.</i>

56:34.838 --> 56:36.171
- On.
- On.

56:36.255 --> 56:37.130
On.

56:37.713 --> 56:38.921
Okay, Section Commander.

56:39.005 --> 56:39.921
What is your next move?

56:40.005 --> 56:41.380
This is my FUP, sir.

56:41.463 --> 56:43.255
I will move my group
to the four stones over there

56:43.338 --> 56:44.796
and give Group 1 support fire,

56:44.880 --> 56:47.046
so that they can start left flanking, sir.

56:47.130 --> 56:48.296
Not bad, Recruit.

56:48.380 --> 56:49.755
You know what FUP is.

56:49.838 --> 56:51.088
Thank you, sir.

56:51.171 --> 56:52.421
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.

56:53.838 --> 56:55.380
Group 1, prepare to move.

56:55.463 --> 56:56.546
Wait for my signal.

56:57.380 --> 56:59.380
When you move,
don't forget the four-second rule.

56:59.963 --> 57:02.380
- Man, move.
- Man, move.

57:02.463 --> 57:05.296
1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000.

57:07.463 --> 57:09.380
- On.
- On.

57:09.463 --> 57:11.088
You are going to shoot Kamala.

57:13.046 --> 57:13.921
Recruit.

57:14.005 --> 57:15.630
Why are you pointing the rifle at me?

57:15.713 --> 57:16.671
Wrong direction.

57:16.755 --> 57:17.796
Sorry, sir.

57:18.755 --> 57:19.630
And you.

57:22.005 --> 57:23.005
Joey, move.

57:23.505 --> 57:24.421
- 1,000, 2,000,
- 1,000…

57:24.505 --> 57:26.296
- 3,000, 4,000.
- Go, the whole section.

57:26.380 --> 57:27.338
Move.

57:34.713 --> 57:36.088
That's my three-second rule.

57:45.380 --> 57:46.755
- Man, move.
- Man, move.

57:48.213 --> 57:49.755
Recruit.

57:49.838 --> 57:51.921
Why are you going
in the wrong direction again?

57:52.005 --> 57:53.921
You are dead.

57:54.005 --> 57:55.005
Can I not die?

57:55.088 --> 57:57.005
I am blur, but I am loyal.

57:57.088 --> 57:58.463
Cannot! Down!

57:59.255 --> 58:00.296
Section Commander.

58:00.380 --> 58:01.921
You are now left with four men.

58:02.005 --> 58:03.296
One man down.

58:03.380 --> 58:04.213
Continue.

58:04.296 --> 58:05.296
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

58:05.380 --> 58:06.671
- Move.
- Move.

58:07.255 --> 58:09.005
1,000, 2,000,

58:09.088 --> 58:10.880
3,000, 4,000.

58:10.963 --> 58:11.838
On.

58:14.130 --> 58:16.463
- Contacted.
- Contacted.

58:20.380 --> 58:22.255
Leopard crawl, that's right.

58:22.338 --> 58:24.546
I want you all to feel
that you are the leopard.

58:24.630 --> 58:26.171
The leopard is inside you.

58:30.505 --> 58:31.880
That looks like an iguana.

58:31.963 --> 58:33.755
Why is your backside so high?

58:34.421 --> 58:35.963
The enemy can shoot you.

58:36.505 --> 58:38.505
The enemy is shooting over there.

58:38.588 --> 58:40.755
You must pretend
that they are firing at you

58:40.838 --> 58:42.838
and they can see you
if you don't crawl properly.

58:45.380 --> 58:47.880
My grandmother's iguana
can crawl better than you.

58:48.921 --> 58:51.463
My grandmother's turtle
can crawl better than you.

58:51.546 --> 58:53.255
Aim and shoot.

58:53.338 --> 58:55.213
- Sir, can I ask you a question?
- What is it?

58:55.296 --> 58:56.963
Despite us shooting so many times,

58:57.046 --> 58:58.213
none of the enemies are dead.

58:58.296 --> 58:59.421
But BQ is dead.

58:59.505 --> 59:00.880
Okay, very good. I like.

59:00.963 --> 59:03.838
You know what? To encourage you,
I will kill off one enemy.

59:04.630 --> 59:06.630
Hey, you. One enemy down.

59:06.713 --> 59:07.713
Okay, sir.

59:08.338 --> 59:10.421
Teck, you are already dead.

59:11.755 --> 59:12.713
Okay.

59:13.338 --> 59:14.213
Thank you, sir.

59:14.296 --> 59:16.671
Your section is now left
with three people.

59:16.755 --> 59:18.546
- Section Commander.
- Sir.

59:18.630 --> 59:19.630
You are dead.

59:20.296 --> 59:21.505
Sir, but why?

59:21.588 --> 59:22.755
Did I do something wrong?

59:22.838 --> 59:24.005
Am I not good enough?

59:24.088 --> 59:26.046
You are very okay and very good.

59:26.130 --> 59:29.171
But we must give others a chance
to be the leader, am I right?

59:29.255 --> 59:30.213
Yes, sir.

59:31.338 --> 59:34.671
Okay, come. Time to prove your leadership.

59:35.713 --> 59:36.880
Yes, sir.

59:37.755 --> 59:39.255
- Section.
- Section.

59:39.338 --> 59:40.921
The enemy still in hut.

59:41.005 --> 59:42.380
- The enemy still in hut.
- Let's take them down.

59:42.463 --> 59:44.005
- Fire!
- Fire!

59:45.963 --> 59:47.380
Group 1, tactical halt.

59:47.463 --> 59:49.255
Turn around and relax.

59:49.338 --> 59:50.630
Listen to me.

59:51.755 --> 59:53.921
Okay, now let's see whether you can deal

59:54.005 --> 59:56.005
with unexpected challenges.

59:56.921 --> 59:59.380
I declare that you have no ammunition.

59:59.463 --> 01:00:01.588
But sir, we haven't fired a single round.

01:00:01.671 --> 01:00:02.963
- Yes.
- I don't care.

01:00:03.463 --> 01:00:06.088
Maybe the magazine dropped out
in the river.

01:00:06.171 --> 01:00:08.213
The monkey stole your magazine.

01:00:08.296 --> 01:00:10.421
As long as I say
that there's no ammunition,

01:00:10.505 --> 01:00:11.421
there's no ammunition.

01:00:11.505 --> 01:00:13.255
No more ammunition?

01:00:13.338 --> 01:00:15.421
I am scared. How do we fight?

01:00:15.505 --> 01:00:18.296
Dear Princess, fear is only an illusion.
Have you forgotten?

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:21.630
That is fear is only an illusion.

01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:24.296
It is all in your mind.

01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:25.463
Fear is only in the mind.

01:00:25.546 --> 01:00:26.546
Remember SOCC?

01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:28.505
- Yes.
- I learned. I'm not scared anymore.

01:00:28.588 --> 01:00:29.630
- Let's fight.
- Sir.

01:00:29.713 --> 01:00:32.005
Can I double-confirm
the objective of our mission?

01:00:32.088 --> 01:00:34.380
The objective of the mission
is to take down the enemy.

01:00:35.713 --> 01:00:36.796
Take down the enemy?

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.130
- Take down the enemy.
- Yes, sir.

01:00:38.213 --> 01:00:39.338
- Take down the enemy.
- Take down the enemy.

01:00:39.421 --> 01:00:40.880
- No ammunition.
- No ammunition.

01:00:41.463 --> 01:00:42.963
Well done. Carry on.

01:00:43.046 --> 01:00:44.255
Sir, can you give us a minute?

01:00:44.338 --> 01:00:45.255
Sure.

01:00:45.338 --> 01:00:46.963
Your minute started 30 seconds ago.

01:00:48.463 --> 01:00:49.713
It's Christmas already.

01:00:50.505 --> 01:00:52.380
It's Chinese New Year already.

01:00:52.463 --> 01:00:53.963
It's Eid already.

01:00:54.046 --> 01:00:55.380
Time flies.

01:00:55.463 --> 01:00:56.713
Sir, we are ready.

01:00:56.796 --> 01:00:58.838
Okay, tell me what your plan is.

01:00:58.921 --> 01:01:00.546
Sir, can we not tell you first?

01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:02.005
We want to surprise you.

01:01:02.088 --> 01:01:03.046
I don't like surprises.

01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:04.838
Sir, can I show you something?

01:01:04.921 --> 01:01:05.796
Okay.

01:01:08.463 --> 01:01:10.296
Village sniper weapon.

01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:11.838
- Sir, are you ready?
- Yes.

01:01:11.921 --> 01:01:13.255
One, two, three.

01:01:16.005 --> 01:01:17.130
Village sniper weapon.

01:01:17.213 --> 01:01:19.046
What type of weapon is this?
This is not a standard-issue weapon.

01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:19.963
Who gave this to you?

01:01:20.046 --> 01:01:22.130
My father
when I was three years old, "childish".

01:01:22.213 --> 01:01:24.005
- Childhood.
- Childhood.

01:01:25.296 --> 01:01:26.921
Sir, this is my initiative.

01:01:27.005 --> 01:01:28.796
Now I know what initiative is.

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.421
It's okay if I have no ammunition.

01:01:30.505 --> 01:01:31.505
I can use this.

01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:34.421
No, what type of weapon is this?
You cannot use this.

01:01:34.505 --> 01:01:36.588
I'm asking you to shoot the enemy
and not the bird.

01:01:36.671 --> 01:01:37.755
The enemy has a "bird".

01:01:37.838 --> 01:01:39.005
I can shoot enemy's "bird"!

01:01:39.088 --> 01:01:41.171
Don't go as this is not a standard weapon.

01:01:41.255 --> 01:01:42.088
Put it away.

01:01:43.296 --> 01:01:45.130
It's okay, sir.
We can't use the weapon, right?

01:01:45.213 --> 01:01:46.130
- We still have a weapon.
- What weapon?

01:01:46.213 --> 01:01:47.338
You have an extra weapon?

01:01:47.421 --> 01:01:48.421
I am the weapon.

01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:51.296
Okay, I like the confidence.

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:53.255
Sir, you don't have to worry
about the process.

01:01:53.338 --> 01:01:54.838
We will shoot down the enemy for you.

01:01:54.921 --> 01:01:56.005
Okay.

01:01:56.088 --> 01:01:57.005
I want to see it.

01:01:57.088 --> 01:01:58.630
I will stand there to eat my satay
and watch the action.

01:02:02.213 --> 01:02:03.046
Move.

01:02:36.796 --> 01:02:38.546
Aim for the head.

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:39.630
Always the head.

01:02:44.338 --> 01:02:46.838
I will kill you today!

01:02:47.671 --> 01:02:49.171
Die, you enemies!

01:02:49.255 --> 01:02:50.505
Stop!

01:02:50.588 --> 01:02:51.463
Cut!

01:02:52.296 --> 01:02:53.588
You win! Stop!

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.838
I have been in the army

01:02:58.921 --> 01:03:01.171
for more than 30 years.

01:03:01.255 --> 01:03:04.005
I have never seen something like that.

01:03:04.088 --> 01:03:05.296
What kind of technique is this?

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:08.046
Sir, this is
the "Ah Lian" gang fight style.

01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:10.130
Soldier, this is the army.

01:03:10.213 --> 01:03:11.838
Not the secret society.

01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:13.296
Gang fight for what?

01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:15.546
You don't bring disrepute
to the army, understand?

01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:17.546
Sir, the gang and army are the same.

01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:18.630
It's all about fighting

01:03:18.713 --> 01:03:20.463
and about winning or losing.

01:03:20.546 --> 01:03:21.755
Whatever.

01:03:21.838 --> 01:03:23.421
Do you know how dangerous that move was?

01:03:23.505 --> 01:03:25.588
You grabbed the weapon that way.
It was so near to your head.

01:03:25.671 --> 01:03:27.380
What if a round went off and hit you?

01:03:27.463 --> 01:03:28.796
Sir, do you know why they sent me there?

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:30.671
- Why?
- Because I am short

01:03:30.755 --> 01:03:32.088
and I will never get shot.

01:03:32.171 --> 01:03:34.171
That's true and that's your asset.

01:03:43.546 --> 01:03:45.421
Sir, my stomach is cramping.

01:03:45.505 --> 01:03:46.380
My auntie is here.

01:03:47.255 --> 01:03:48.630
She's here?

01:03:48.713 --> 01:03:51.255
In this camp?
This is a controlled area, you know?

01:03:51.338 --> 01:03:53.005
If she's here without permission,

01:03:53.088 --> 01:03:54.421
you can get charged.

01:03:54.505 --> 01:03:56.630
Sir, my menses is here.

01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:59.296
That.

01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:00.796
Yes, go and find your auntie.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:01.963
Thank you, sir.

01:04:02.046 --> 01:04:03.838
Sorry, my Chinese is not very good.

01:04:04.588 --> 01:04:06.796
Sir, you challenged us with no ammunition.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.588
So our plans had to be impromptu.

01:04:10.671 --> 01:04:13.130
Sir, you've been in the army
for more than 30 years, right?

01:04:13.838 --> 01:04:15.880
Can I ask you a question,
so that I can learn?

01:04:15.963 --> 01:04:16.921
Of course.

01:04:17.005 --> 01:04:18.880
If you are at war with no ammunition,

01:04:18.963 --> 01:04:19.880
what would you do?

01:04:34.463 --> 01:04:35.588
That is a good question.

01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:38.421
But you should not ask this question
during your test.

01:04:38.505 --> 01:04:40.296
Because this is your test.

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:42.755
This test is for you and not for me.

01:04:42.838 --> 01:04:44.171
Understand?

01:04:44.255 --> 01:04:45.296
Yes, sir.

01:04:50.838 --> 01:04:51.755
Sir.

01:04:51.838 --> 01:04:52.838
They are fighting.

01:05:04.296 --> 01:05:05.463
- Cease fire!
- Cease fire!

01:05:05.546 --> 01:05:07.255
- Take cover.
- Take cover.

01:05:07.755 --> 01:05:10.296
- Keep it up.
- Keep it up.

01:05:14.588 --> 01:05:16.838
Put down your weapon!

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.838
- I'm not the enemy!
- Stop!

01:05:28.921 --> 01:05:30.255
- Enemy, sir!
- Enemy, sir!

01:05:30.338 --> 01:05:31.213
Sergeant Poh!

01:05:31.921 --> 01:05:34.213
- Oh, my God!
- It's your Sergeant!

01:05:35.005 --> 01:05:36.005
Section Commander!

01:05:36.088 --> 01:05:38.255
No, stop fighting! Get off!

01:05:38.338 --> 01:05:40.046
Stop fighting! No!

01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:41.380
No more!

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:44.921
Do you know that the enemy
is your Sergeant?

01:05:45.005 --> 01:05:47.213
How can you physically assault him
like that?

01:05:47.713 --> 01:05:49.005
Sorry, sir.

01:05:49.088 --> 01:05:51.421
No one told us
that the "animal" is our Sergeant.

01:05:51.505 --> 01:05:53.338
- Enemy.
- Enemy.

01:05:53.421 --> 01:05:55.921
Yes, sir.
Luckily, they are wearing our uniforms.

01:05:56.005 --> 01:05:57.588
If not, we would have killed them already.

01:05:57.671 --> 01:05:58.838
What gang are you from?

01:05:59.463 --> 01:06:01.380
Sir, we feel so bad and we are so sorry.

01:06:01.463 --> 01:06:03.005
- We will drop 50, okay?
- Sorry, sir.

01:06:03.088 --> 01:06:05.005
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

01:06:05.838 --> 01:06:08.421
- One, sir.
- One, sir.

01:06:08.505 --> 01:06:10.130
- Bravo.
- Two, sir.

01:06:10.213 --> 01:06:11.296
Three, sir.

01:06:11.963 --> 01:06:13.546
What you all did just now…

01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:15.296
Unconventional way.

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:17.296
How can you throw down your rifle
and fight the enemy?

01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:19.380
You think you are playing house?

01:06:19.463 --> 01:06:21.213
<i>Candy Crush</i>? <i>Fortnite</i>?

01:06:21.296 --> 01:06:22.838
I'm talking about you,

01:06:22.921 --> 01:06:24.505
you, and you too.

01:06:24.588 --> 01:06:26.755
Me? Sir, I didn't throw it.

01:06:26.838 --> 01:06:28.755
You asked me to put it down so I did.

01:06:28.838 --> 01:06:29.963
Did you forget?

01:06:30.046 --> 01:06:31.338
I asked you all to put it down

01:06:31.421 --> 01:06:34.088
because you were using it
to hit your Sergeant.

01:06:34.838 --> 01:06:36.796
And you.

01:06:37.296 --> 01:06:39.588
How can you use the catapult
to shoot the enemy?

01:06:39.671 --> 01:06:40.755
What happened to your rifle?

01:06:41.463 --> 01:06:43.713
Do you know that it is an insult
to your instructors

01:06:43.796 --> 01:06:44.838
and to your rifle

01:06:44.921 --> 01:06:45.921
to use the catapult?

01:06:46.005 --> 01:06:47.838
The rifle is now standing and crying
in the corner.

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:49.588
Because you hurt its feelings.

01:06:49.671 --> 01:06:50.838
You used the catapult.

01:06:52.255 --> 01:06:54.671
But sir, the catapult is my initiative.

01:06:54.755 --> 01:06:57.171
What type of initiative is this?
This is bullshit!

01:06:58.088 --> 01:06:59.838
How can the two of you

01:06:59.921 --> 01:07:01.796
charge in front of the enemy

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:04.005
when the enemy is firing
at your support team?

01:07:04.088 --> 01:07:05.505
Do you think you are Rambo?

01:07:06.421 --> 01:07:08.088
You don't know who Rambo is?
Okay, you are all too young.

01:07:08.171 --> 01:07:09.546
Do you think you are "Tom Screw"?

01:07:11.963 --> 01:07:13.880
The movie is movie.

01:07:13.963 --> 01:07:15.421
Real life is real life.

01:07:15.505 --> 01:07:17.005
Mistakes you make in real life

01:07:17.088 --> 01:07:18.838
may not be corrected sometimes

01:07:18.921 --> 01:07:21.713
with just 20 push-ups or 200 push-ups.

01:07:21.796 --> 01:07:23.213
What type of strategy is this?

01:07:23.296 --> 01:07:24.671
Who taught you this?

01:07:24.755 --> 01:07:26.380
Who's the appointment holder?

01:07:26.463 --> 01:07:27.421
It's me, sir.

01:07:28.588 --> 01:07:30.255
Sir, to my understanding,

01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:31.755
this is the BMT test

01:07:31.838 --> 01:07:34.421
and you challenged us to fight
without ammunition.

01:07:34.505 --> 01:07:35.546
Truth be told, sir,

01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:36.713
it's not easy for us.

01:07:36.796 --> 01:07:38.630
- Yes.
- Sir.

01:07:39.213 --> 01:07:42.088
Actually, when it comes
to fighting without ammunition,

01:07:42.171 --> 01:07:44.380
I think even the National Servicemen
and Regulars

01:07:44.463 --> 01:07:46.171
will believe that the only way to do it

01:07:46.255 --> 01:07:47.630
is to find a hard object

01:07:47.713 --> 01:07:50.380
and hit the enemy!

01:07:50.463 --> 01:07:52.255
So that we can protect our team

01:07:52.338 --> 01:07:53.713
and not get killed.

01:07:53.796 --> 01:07:55.255
That is exactly what we did.

01:07:55.338 --> 01:07:58.130
- Yes.
- We did it effectively and swiftly.

01:07:58.213 --> 01:08:01.380
Yes, we realized that different situations
require different tactics

01:08:01.463 --> 01:08:02.713
and we need to be flexible.

01:08:02.796 --> 01:08:05.796
In the end, we took down
all our enemies successfully.

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:07.713
The mission was completed not in your way,

01:08:07.796 --> 01:08:09.130
but in the most victorious way.

01:08:09.213 --> 01:08:11.255
- Right, girls?
- Yes.

01:08:11.338 --> 01:08:13.421
So what you all are trying to say is that

01:08:13.505 --> 01:08:14.963
you all are happy with the results?

01:08:15.046 --> 01:08:16.380
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:20.005
Sir, just curious.

01:08:20.088 --> 01:08:21.046
What is the right way?

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:22.963
I think this is the second time
I am asking you.

01:08:23.046 --> 01:08:24.796
The first time was at the hut,
but you did not answer.

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.463
Yes, sir. We want to learn.

01:08:26.546 --> 01:08:28.630
- What is the right way?
- We want to learn.

01:08:28.713 --> 01:08:29.755
That is a good question.

01:08:30.463 --> 01:08:33.088
Okay, and to ask that again

01:08:33.755 --> 01:08:35.463
and I will give you an answer.

01:08:36.005 --> 01:08:38.130
Lieutenant Tay, please tell them
what is the right way.

01:08:38.213 --> 01:08:39.671
- Me?
- Yes.

01:08:39.755 --> 01:08:41.005
Carry on.

01:08:41.088 --> 01:08:42.755
Okay, so the right way

01:08:42.838 --> 01:08:46.046
is to call for support
and wait for reinforcements.

01:08:46.713 --> 01:08:47.671
But sir,

01:08:48.296 --> 01:08:49.713
during a critical moment like that,

01:08:49.796 --> 01:08:51.213
how can we wait for reinforcements?

01:08:51.296 --> 01:08:54.630
- How?
- Just wait for reinforcements.

01:08:54.713 --> 01:08:57.421
Your safety is number one, right?

01:08:57.505 --> 01:08:59.255
Okay, I'll give you a real-life example.

01:08:59.338 --> 01:09:00.755
You're on the plane and taking off.

01:09:00.838 --> 01:09:03.255
The air stewardess will always say
before we take off,

01:09:03.338 --> 01:09:04.880
"In case of emergency,

01:09:04.963 --> 01:09:06.546
a mask will drop down from above.

01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:07.921
Please put the mask on yourself

01:09:08.005 --> 01:09:09.505
before helping the child next to you."

01:09:09.588 --> 01:09:10.588
So what does that mean?

01:09:10.671 --> 01:09:12.255
- The child is not important.
- The child is not important.

01:09:12.338 --> 01:09:15.671
No, not that the child is not important.

01:09:15.755 --> 01:09:17.755
Your safety is number one.

01:09:17.838 --> 01:09:20.171
If you don't save yourself,
you cannot save the baby, right?

01:09:20.255 --> 01:09:21.171
Do you understand?

01:09:21.255 --> 01:09:22.505
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:09:22.588 --> 01:09:23.588
And one more thing.

01:09:23.671 --> 01:09:28.255
Please do not ever lose
or drop your rifle.

01:09:29.255 --> 01:09:30.630
Do you remember what you swore

01:09:30.713 --> 01:09:32.130
at the rifle presentation ceremony?

01:09:32.213 --> 01:09:35.338
"I will take good care
of my rifle at all times."

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:36.296
And that is why

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:38.005
your rifle is called your "husband".

01:09:38.088 --> 01:09:40.546
"Husband" is a very serious word

01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:41.880
and is not to be trifled with.

01:09:41.963 --> 01:09:45.630
Okay, this BMT test is no good.

01:09:45.713 --> 01:09:48.671
I want to see better performance
from you at your next test.

01:09:48.755 --> 01:09:51.005
I will see you at the SIT test.

01:09:52.046 --> 01:09:53.880
SIT test is where we find out

01:09:53.963 --> 01:09:57.380
whether you have the talent
to be a Sergeant or an Officer.

01:09:59.713 --> 01:10:01.213
It's like a talent show.

01:10:01.296 --> 01:10:02.588
<i>Jungle Got Talent.</i>

01:10:04.505 --> 01:10:05.546
Do your best.

01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:07.296
Okay, carry on. That's all for me.

01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:10.046
Okay, come. Let's thank Lieutenant Choong.

01:10:11.088 --> 01:10:12.130
Thank you.

01:10:12.213 --> 01:10:13.588
Recruits, any more questions?

01:10:13.671 --> 01:10:15.171
- No, Sergeant.
- No, Sergeant.

01:10:15.255 --> 01:10:17.588
Okay, if you all want
to be an Officer like me

01:10:17.671 --> 01:10:18.671
or a Sergeant like him,

01:10:18.755 --> 01:10:20.380
you all better do well, okay?

01:10:20.463 --> 01:10:21.546
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:22.796
Recruits, on your feet.

01:10:23.796 --> 01:10:24.796
Come on. Hurry up.

01:10:36.255 --> 01:10:39.546
<i>For today's test,
we will split into two teams,</i>

01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:41.296
<i>Team A and Team B.</i>

01:10:42.505 --> 01:10:45.630
<i>Team A, your task
is to transport weapon parts</i>

01:10:45.713 --> 01:10:47.713
<i>to a location close to the enemy.</i>

01:10:47.796 --> 01:10:50.796
<i>For Team B, your mission
is to rescue a teammate</i>

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.963
<i>that is injured and unable to walk.</i>

01:10:54.046 --> 01:10:56.505
<i>I will wait for you at the objective</i>

01:10:56.588 --> 01:10:58.296
<i>and good luck.</i>

01:11:05.921 --> 01:11:07.796
IC, tell them to halt.

01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:08.796
Halt.

01:11:10.088 --> 01:11:10.921
I am so tired.

01:11:11.005 --> 01:11:12.546
- How long more do we have to go?
- Hello.

01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:14.838
This is tactical movement,
you are not supposed to talk.

01:11:14.921 --> 01:11:15.755
Is that clear?

01:11:15.838 --> 01:11:17.463
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Yes, Sergeant.

01:11:17.546 --> 01:11:19.046
Recruits.

01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:21.296
We are in the middle
of the forest right now.

01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:23.213
We are 1 km away from the main road

01:11:23.296 --> 01:11:24.921
and 1 km more to our objective.

01:11:25.005 --> 01:11:25.921
Are you guys tired?

01:11:26.005 --> 01:11:27.380
- No, Sergeant.
- No, Sergeant.

01:11:27.463 --> 01:11:29.421
Good. IC, carry on.

01:11:30.421 --> 01:11:32.171
I want to go to the toilet.

01:11:32.255 --> 01:11:33.421
You want to go to the toilet?

01:11:33.505 --> 01:11:34.463
Tell Sergeant Chow.

01:11:34.546 --> 01:11:36.671
- I'm scared.
- Why? What's wrong?

01:11:36.755 --> 01:11:38.505
Sergeant Chow,
she wants to go to the toilet.

01:11:38.588 --> 01:11:41.088
- What?
- Yes, Sergeant. It's very urgent.

01:11:41.171 --> 01:11:43.546
Didn't I ask all of you to clear
in the morning?

01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:44.755
Yes, Sergeant. I know.

01:11:44.838 --> 01:11:46.796
But I don't know why there are leftovers.

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:47.796
Recruits.

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.338
You are in the middle of the SIT test

01:11:49.421 --> 01:11:51.046
and you are already late by half an hour.

01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:52.671
Yet you still want to go to the toilet?

01:11:52.755 --> 01:11:54.046
Sorry, Sergeant.

01:11:54.130 --> 01:11:56.380
- Are you able to hold it in?
- No, it's already at customs.

01:11:56.463 --> 01:11:57.838
They are rushing out.

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.338
- Anyone else?
- Me.

01:12:00.421 --> 01:12:01.838
Me too, Sergeant.

01:12:01.921 --> 01:12:02.796
You again?

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:04.088
First time for me, Sergeant.

01:12:05.505 --> 01:12:06.421
Okay.

01:12:06.505 --> 01:12:07.463
Hurry up and go.

01:12:07.546 --> 01:12:08.921
- I'll give you all five minutes.
- Thank you, Sergeant.

01:12:19.796 --> 01:12:21.046
Brothers.

01:12:21.130 --> 01:12:22.921
We are now here.

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:26.588
Then we will walk to the beach
via this route.

01:12:26.671 --> 01:12:30.880
<i>And we will swim 2 km to Johor Bahru.</i>

01:12:30.963 --> 01:12:33.213
Then the boss will meet us there.

01:12:33.296 --> 01:12:34.213
Swim?

01:12:34.296 --> 01:12:35.505
Swim over?

01:12:36.296 --> 01:12:37.296
It's dangerous.

01:12:38.755 --> 01:12:42.171
Last time, a terrorist also swam
to Malaysia.

01:12:42.921 --> 01:12:44.546
The police did not know it.

01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:46.088
He ran away.

01:12:46.171 --> 01:12:47.213
No danger.

01:12:48.671 --> 01:12:51.713
Why? Do you have no balls to swim?

01:12:51.796 --> 01:12:52.963
I have.

01:12:57.130 --> 01:12:58.921
I think we can do it here.

01:12:59.005 --> 01:13:01.213
- Where? Around there?
- I don't want. It's dirty.

01:13:02.963 --> 01:13:03.838
Go.

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.963
Cannot, there are too many ants.

01:13:11.046 --> 01:13:12.546
- Muddy.
- No bushes.

01:13:13.088 --> 01:13:15.421
- I think I see something.
- There's a drain here.

01:13:15.505 --> 01:13:17.046
- What if there are crocodiles?
- No.

01:13:18.130 --> 01:13:19.088
Police?

01:13:20.546 --> 01:13:23.005
No, they are soldiers.

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:27.380
That's a very good rifle.

01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:30.088
We can bring it home.

01:13:30.171 --> 01:13:32.463
They have guns and bullets.

01:13:32.546 --> 01:13:34.796
No, they are just training.

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.463
- No bullets.
- Okay.

01:13:36.546 --> 01:13:38.546
- And they are female soldiers.
- I think here is okay.

01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:40.796
- Is it?
- Yes.

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.380
Let me see if there's anyone around.

01:13:42.463 --> 01:13:44.255
I think here is okay. There's a drain.

01:13:44.338 --> 01:13:45.630
Okay.

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:48.921
- Do not stand too far away from me.
- Okay.

01:13:51.630 --> 01:13:53.130
What are you doing? Remember?

01:13:53.213 --> 01:13:55.213
We must take good care of our rifles
at all times.

01:13:55.296 --> 01:13:56.921
How can you put your rifles on the ground?

01:13:57.005 --> 01:13:58.921
How do I pee carrying the rifle?

01:13:59.005 --> 01:14:01.338
Everybody, look here.

01:14:01.421 --> 01:14:02.713
It's stuck this way. See!

01:14:02.796 --> 01:14:04.796
Let's do this quickly. No one's looking.

01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:06.796
Do this too.

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:08.838
I want to hug my husband at all times.

01:14:08.921 --> 01:14:11.380
- I'm peeing.
- Okay, hurry.

01:14:37.171 --> 01:14:38.838
Don't take my rifle!

01:14:43.296 --> 01:14:45.046
Don't take my rifle!

01:14:49.463 --> 01:14:51.046
My legs!

01:14:57.505 --> 01:14:58.463
My rifle!

01:14:58.546 --> 01:15:01.421
I will take good care of my rifle
at all times.

01:15:01.505 --> 01:15:03.338
He also took my rifle!

01:15:03.421 --> 01:15:05.421
Also, I don't want you all to get charged

01:15:05.505 --> 01:15:07.588
and go to Detention Barracks
for losing your weapon. Understand?

01:15:07.671 --> 01:15:09.880
- Joey!
- Joey, protect your rifle!

01:15:09.963 --> 01:15:12.171
- Be careful, Joey!
- Be careful!

01:15:14.338 --> 01:15:15.713
Don't take my rifle!

01:15:15.796 --> 01:15:16.880
This is my husband!

01:15:19.088 --> 01:15:21.296
- Be careful, Joey!
- Be careful!

01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:23.255
Helmet, protect me.

01:15:23.338 --> 01:15:24.713
Help!

01:15:24.796 --> 01:15:26.296
I can't move my legs!

01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:29.380
- Princess, I can't move my legs!
- I can't move either!

01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:33.630
Help! Sergeant Chow!

01:15:33.713 --> 01:15:34.796
- Halt.
- Help!

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:38.213
Sergeant Chow! Help!

01:15:38.296 --> 01:15:41.505
Help! Sergeant Chow!

01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:45.380
IC, take over.

01:15:45.463 --> 01:15:46.588
The rest of you, stay here.

01:15:46.671 --> 01:15:48.546
- Recruit Karen, follow me.
- Yes, Sergeant.

01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:49.505
Let's go.

01:15:52.171 --> 01:15:53.838
We did not plant any enemies there.

01:15:53.921 --> 01:15:55.130
Something is wrong.

01:15:59.588 --> 01:16:00.671
- Who are you?
- That's our rifle.

01:16:00.755 --> 01:16:02.088
- Who are you?
- Where are you from?

01:16:02.171 --> 01:16:03.213
Stay back.

01:16:03.296 --> 01:16:04.546
Put down your rifle.

01:16:09.588 --> 01:16:10.796
You…

01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:50.088
- Take the rifle!
- Yes, ma'am.

01:17:08.755 --> 01:17:10.255
- Tie them up.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:17:10.338 --> 01:17:12.338
Tie them up with the toggle rope.

01:17:13.046 --> 01:17:15.505
Something must have happened to them.
We should go and help.

01:17:15.588 --> 01:17:16.630
But our instructors told us

01:17:16.713 --> 01:17:18.421
we should wait for reinforcements.

01:17:18.505 --> 01:17:19.838
We are the reinforcements.

01:17:19.921 --> 01:17:21.880
Is it? Why did no one tell us?

01:17:21.963 --> 01:17:23.921
Don't worry, just apply what we learned.

01:17:24.005 --> 01:17:25.296
Okay.

01:17:36.338 --> 01:17:37.796
Sergeant!

01:17:42.255 --> 01:17:43.255
Are you okay?

01:17:45.921 --> 01:17:47.130
Calling all stations.

01:17:48.588 --> 01:17:49.588
Calling?

01:17:50.755 --> 01:17:51.963
Stay over here, okay?

01:17:52.046 --> 01:17:53.213
Bobo, follow me.

01:18:11.463 --> 01:18:13.505
<i>PC to all stations. No Duff.</i>

01:18:13.588 --> 01:18:16.046
<i>Request for immediate support
at Tango Alpha locality.</i>

01:18:18.755 --> 01:18:19.796
- Sergeant!
- Sergeant!

01:18:23.338 --> 01:18:25.088
- Sergeant Chow!
- Sergeant Chow is in danger!

01:18:25.171 --> 01:18:26.671
Help him!

01:18:26.755 --> 01:18:28.171
Hit the head!

01:18:31.546 --> 01:18:33.255
I am going to flatten you!

01:18:40.505 --> 01:18:42.421
Girls, quickly run!

01:18:42.505 --> 01:18:44.505
- He has a knife!
- Girls!

01:18:44.588 --> 01:18:46.130
Run now, faster!

01:19:07.171 --> 01:19:08.380
Hey, stop it!

01:19:16.130 --> 01:19:17.630
Sergeant Chow!

01:19:17.713 --> 01:19:20.213
- Sergeant Chow is bleeding!
- Get help!

01:19:28.005 --> 01:19:29.755
Ma'am!

01:19:29.838 --> 01:19:32.171
Ma'am, his back and armpit
are bleeding very badly.

01:19:32.255 --> 01:19:33.838
Call an ambulance, ma'am!

01:19:33.921 --> 01:19:35.796
The ambulance can't come in here.
We got to carry him out.

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:37.255
Take out your FAD.

01:19:37.338 --> 01:19:39.171
- Okay.
- FAD.

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.588
Ma'am, can you demonstrate to us

01:19:44.671 --> 01:19:48.171
how to carry a fireman and run
when you are very tired?

01:19:55.838 --> 01:19:58.255
Use FAD and keep pressing
to stop the blood.

01:20:05.296 --> 01:20:06.213
Quick.

01:20:06.296 --> 01:20:08.880
Keep him awake. We got to be faster.

01:20:08.963 --> 01:20:10.755
Quick! Run!

01:20:14.463 --> 01:20:16.088
Keep pressing the wound, don't let go.

01:20:16.171 --> 01:20:17.546
Keep pressing, come on.

01:20:25.255 --> 01:20:27.963
Sergeant Chow, wake up!

01:20:35.546 --> 01:20:39.421
Ma'am, I think God created women
with physical limitations.

01:20:39.505 --> 01:20:40.505
Carrying casualties?

01:20:40.588 --> 01:20:41.838
We really cannot.

01:20:48.046 --> 01:20:50.421
Sergeant Chow, stay with me.

01:20:52.130 --> 01:20:53.463
Are you willing to abandon them?

01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:14.088
Keep pressing.

01:21:14.171 --> 01:21:15.171
Keep pressing.

01:21:16.005 --> 01:21:17.088
Stretcher is here!

01:21:17.671 --> 01:21:19.046
Stretcher is here!

01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:21.130
<i>Yes, we are very tired.</i>

01:21:21.213 --> 01:21:24.296
<i>But none of us are thinking of giving up.</i>

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.505
<i>Not even one second of delay.</i>

01:21:26.588 --> 01:21:28.296
<i>We cannot afford it.</i>

01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:30.213
<i>We have to move fast.</i>

01:21:30.296 --> 01:21:32.005
<i>Come on, Section 2!</i>

01:21:32.088 --> 01:21:33.838
<i>Move faster!</i>

01:21:36.963 --> 01:21:38.671
Don't panic, I'm here!

01:21:38.755 --> 01:21:41.046
Inform HQ!

01:22:56.255 --> 01:22:58.880
ONWARD SINGAPORE ARMY

01:23:09.130 --> 01:23:10.130
Good morning, ladies.

01:23:11.130 --> 01:23:12.338
When it was first announced

01:23:12.421 --> 01:23:15.505
that females would be conscripted
into the military,

01:23:15.588 --> 01:23:17.588
many people expressed their doubts.

01:23:17.671 --> 01:23:19.213
And I think today

01:23:19.296 --> 01:23:21.380
is the day that you proved them wrong.

01:23:21.463 --> 01:23:23.796
Following three months of basic training,

01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:26.546
you will now be subjected to more rigorous

01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:28.296
and specialized training.

01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:29.630
In modern-day war,

01:23:29.713 --> 01:23:32.671
we no longer rely solely
on physical combat.

01:23:32.755 --> 01:23:35.296
We now also need your intelligence

01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:39.421
in areas like research, planning,

01:23:39.505 --> 01:23:41.505
and high-tech weapon management.

01:23:41.588 --> 01:23:44.296
But Bravo Company's Platoon 5 Section 2

01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:48.088
has proven that actions
speak louder than words.

01:23:48.171 --> 01:23:51.796
Although it has only been three months
of Basic Military Training,

01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:53.005
they have displayed strength,

01:23:53.505 --> 01:23:56.630
<i>perseverance, wisdom, and unity</i>

01:23:56.713 --> 01:23:59.588
<i>from their unexpected encounter
with hostile forces.</i>

01:24:01.296 --> 01:24:02.588
<i>Like all soldiers,</i>

01:24:02.671 --> 01:24:05.005
<i>the phrase "Leave no man behind"</i>

01:24:05.088 --> 01:24:07.296
is deeply embedded in their minds

01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:11.046
in the battlefield that they belong.

01:24:11.130 --> 01:24:14.171
Standing side by side,
with the rest of the soldiers,

01:24:15.255 --> 01:24:17.963
I would also like to thank
both my commanders

01:24:18.046 --> 01:24:21.921
for their bravery
in rescuing their recruits.

01:24:22.005 --> 01:24:25.588
Sergeant CK Chow
and Lieutenant Roxanne Tan.

01:24:26.755 --> 01:24:28.796
As you have seen from recent events,

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:32.796
if your home is invaded
by foreign enemies,

01:24:33.755 --> 01:24:37.171
your loved ones suffering
in the hands of tyranny,

01:24:37.255 --> 01:24:39.546
if not you, then who would protect them?

01:24:40.588 --> 01:24:42.671
You're now a part of our army,

01:24:42.755 --> 01:24:46.130
part of a voice
that will tell the aggressor

01:24:46.213 --> 01:24:47.796
that you will fight.

01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:50.421
Fight for our nation's independence,

01:24:50.505 --> 01:24:52.088
for the freedom

01:24:52.171 --> 01:24:54.463
and for the right to live.

01:24:54.546 --> 01:24:55.838
So thank you

01:24:55.921 --> 01:24:58.421
and congratulations on your graduation.

01:25:07.630 --> 01:25:09.213
Whole lot, recover!

01:25:09.296 --> 01:25:10.380
Left turn.

01:25:11.171 --> 01:25:12.421
About turn.

01:25:32.171 --> 01:25:33.463
How dare you sabotage us?

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.588
Are you tired of living?

01:25:36.671 --> 01:25:38.213
Come down if you dare.

01:26:00.171 --> 01:26:01.630
Okay, let's go.

01:26:03.671 --> 01:26:05.505
- Nice.
- Mani, we have already POP.

01:26:05.588 --> 01:26:07.421
Who is the "white horse"

01:26:07.505 --> 01:26:10.213
you have been talking about?

01:26:10.296 --> 01:26:14.088
I heard the "white horse"
is the daughter of a minister.

01:26:14.171 --> 01:26:16.296
Actually, I am also very curious
who it is.

01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:18.296
Hello, are you talking about me?

01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:20.963
Princess, are you the daughter
of a minister?

01:26:23.255 --> 01:26:25.213
My family only has rice dumplings,
but not ministers.

01:26:25.963 --> 01:26:27.088
Come on.

01:26:29.671 --> 01:26:31.088
The minister is here.

01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:35.171
Here.

01:26:35.255 --> 01:26:39.088
<i>In a serious shortage of manpower
in the National Service,</i>

01:26:39.171 --> 01:26:41.171
we have therefore decided

01:26:41.255 --> 01:26:42.588
to enlist women

01:26:42.671 --> 01:26:44.963
above the age of 20

01:26:45.046 --> 01:26:46.921
in the armed forces.

01:26:47.005 --> 01:26:49.588
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Hello, congratulations.

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:50.755
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:26:50.838 --> 01:26:52.588
Are you here to look for your daughter?

01:26:52.671 --> 01:26:53.505
Yes.

01:26:53.588 --> 01:26:55.630
- Who's your daughter?
- You mean you don't know?

01:26:55.713 --> 01:26:56.963
No. Who is it?

01:26:59.671 --> 01:27:02.046
- Karen
- Karen.

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:06.713
I miss you.

01:27:06.796 --> 01:27:08.171
Did she give you any trouble?

01:27:08.255 --> 01:27:09.171
- No.
- No.

01:27:09.255 --> 01:27:10.171
She's very nice.

01:27:10.255 --> 01:27:11.421
Why didn't you say anything?

01:27:11.505 --> 01:27:12.630
Yes, it was you.

01:27:12.713 --> 01:27:14.338
When I exclaimed back then…

01:27:15.046 --> 01:27:16.755
I think maybe Princess
is the "white horse".

01:27:16.838 --> 01:27:18.005
- She's very rich.
- Yes.

01:27:18.088 --> 01:27:19.213
You didn't say anything.

01:27:19.296 --> 01:27:21.088
Everybody, let's take a photo together.

01:27:21.671 --> 01:27:23.005
Okay, take photos.

01:27:24.255 --> 01:27:25.713
One, two, three, smile.

01:27:28.671 --> 01:27:30.713
I'm okay. How are you guys?

01:27:30.796 --> 01:27:31.630
Good.

01:27:32.671 --> 01:27:34.005
One, two, three.

01:27:43.171 --> 01:27:47.546
- Sergeant Chow!
- Sergeant Chow!

01:27:52.921 --> 01:27:56.963
Ah Girls Go Army, it's okay!

01:28:32.213 --> 01:28:34.380
<i>No! No!</i>

01:29:20.421 --> 01:29:21.338
- Tomahawk.
- Tomahawk.

01:29:21.421 --> 01:29:23.255
This is outrageous.

01:29:23.338 --> 01:29:24.588
How did you bring this in?

01:29:24.671 --> 01:29:25.505
Wait.

01:29:25.588 --> 01:29:27.213
I also created trouble.

01:29:27.296 --> 01:29:30.005
I want to say sorry to Princess and Joey

01:29:30.088 --> 01:29:31.713
for hurting you. I'm sorry.

01:29:41.505 --> 01:29:44.630
Anyway, I brought something really good.

01:29:47.296 --> 01:29:49.546
- Steamboat?
- Steamboat?

01:29:49.630 --> 01:29:51.296
How did you bring this huge pot in?

01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:53.921
The canteen uncle
helped smuggle it in for us.

01:29:54.005 --> 01:29:55.713
Then we used tactical movement

01:29:55.796 --> 01:29:57.171
to bring it into the bunk.

01:29:57.255 --> 01:29:59.838
- Tactical movement.
- Tactical movement.

01:29:59.921 --> 01:30:01.921
Why did he help you smuggle it in?

01:30:02.005 --> 01:30:04.421
He's the uncle of my gang member.

01:30:05.005 --> 01:30:06.546
No wonder.

01:30:06.630 --> 01:30:08.380
Girls, anything else you want to share?

01:30:08.463 --> 01:30:09.630
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:30:12.046 --> 01:30:13.588
So much love.

01:30:13.671 --> 01:30:14.671
For your information,

01:30:14.755 --> 01:30:15.796
according to the book,

01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:18.046
bringing extra food
and partying in the bunk

01:30:18.130 --> 01:30:19.255
is a chargeable offense.

01:30:19.338 --> 01:30:21.005
Up to one-weekend confinement.

01:30:21.630 --> 01:30:23.296
It's my habit.

01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:24.796
But is it really worth it?

01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:25.838
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:30:25.921 --> 01:30:26.880
Don't worry.

01:30:26.963 --> 01:30:29.671
- Everything is under control.
- Everything is under control.

01:30:31.005 --> 01:30:32.421
Look at ma'am.

01:30:32.505 --> 01:30:34.796
Problem is at you…

01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:37.213
And what's that? I said it wrongly.

01:30:37.296 --> 01:30:38.588
Sorry, everyone.

01:30:38.671 --> 01:30:40.213
- You said it wrongly again.
- Yes.

01:30:44.046 --> 01:30:45.505
This thing came out.

01:30:50.421 --> 01:30:52.463
The rock flipped.

01:30:52.546 --> 01:30:54.796
Can we settle it day by day?

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:55.838
No.

01:30:59.213 --> 01:31:01.630
The problem is my account
is only left with seven dollars.

01:31:01.713 --> 01:31:03.963
Now I am "hangry" and hungry.

01:31:04.671 --> 01:31:05.546
What did I say?

01:31:05.630 --> 01:31:06.546
Sorry.

01:31:06.630 --> 01:31:08.255
- Scram.
- Do you have a boyfriend?

01:31:08.338 --> 01:31:09.713
I don't have.

01:31:09.796 --> 01:31:10.671
Me too.

01:31:10.755 --> 01:31:13.505
Bye, see you in the next life.

01:31:13.588 --> 01:31:14.546
Show her.

01:31:14.630 --> 01:31:16.296
- Don't want.
- Show her.

01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:17.255
Don't want.

01:31:17.338 --> 01:31:18.213
Okay.

01:31:18.296 --> 01:31:19.171
Ask me again.

01:31:19.255 --> 01:31:20.755
- Show her.
- Okay, I'll go.

01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:22.796
So Sergeant…

01:31:24.796 --> 01:31:27.463
You need to tell me
to have a good weekend.

01:31:27.546 --> 01:31:29.255
- Have a good weekend.
- That's right.

01:31:29.338 --> 01:31:31.421
In life, there will be ups and downs

01:31:31.505 --> 01:31:32.963
and even upsets.

01:31:33.755 --> 01:31:35.588
Sorry, and even setbacks.

01:31:35.671 --> 01:31:41.130
- Joey!
- Joey!

01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:43.838
Village sniper weapon.

01:31:45.421 --> 01:31:47.880
Help me. It's stuck.

01:31:47.963 --> 01:31:48.963
One, two, three.

01:31:50.296 --> 01:31:51.588
Okay. Cut.

01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:00.338
Cut.

01:32:03.171 --> 01:32:04.338
Don't kill him for real.

01:32:05.171 --> 01:32:06.005
We've cut?

01:32:06.088 --> 01:32:07.171
Yuan Yuan, great news.

01:32:07.255 --> 01:32:09.296
My friend's brother finally passed his…

01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:11.296
Math exams.

01:32:12.255 --> 01:32:13.588
Jolene.

01:32:13.671 --> 01:32:14.796
Joanne.

01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:16.296
- What is it?
- It's Joey.

01:32:17.213 --> 01:32:19.171
- Who is Joanne?
- You might as well call me Jovid.

01:32:19.255 --> 01:32:21.255
Got brother our custom…

01:32:23.005 --> 01:32:23.963
Our customer.

01:32:24.046 --> 01:32:26.171
See? Talk about ending the shoot day.

01:32:26.255 --> 01:32:28.838
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

01:32:28.921 --> 01:32:29.838
One more time.

01:32:31.796 --> 01:32:33.005
One more time.

01:32:33.088 --> 01:32:35.546
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

01:32:36.630 --> 01:32:38.796
- Come on.
- Girls.

01:32:40.046 --> 01:32:42.463
Well done, ladies.

01:32:42.546 --> 01:32:44.630
I am so proud of all of you.

01:32:44.713 --> 01:32:46.755
You can see
that the training we provided you

01:32:46.838 --> 01:32:49.838
has given you this day of victory.

01:32:49.921 --> 01:32:51.255
Give yourselves a clap.

01:32:52.505 --> 01:32:53.463
Just one.

01:32:55.005 --> 01:32:58.713
Sir, thank you for teaching us
how to fight without ammunition.

01:32:58.796 --> 01:33:00.046
You see? Yes.

01:33:00.130 --> 01:33:01.463
Yes.

01:33:01.546 --> 01:33:02.713
We foresaw this.

01:33:03.213 --> 01:33:05.296
That is why training without ammunition

01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:06.880
was part of the syllabus.

01:33:06.963 --> 01:33:09.546
Sir, I want to tell you something.

01:33:09.630 --> 01:33:11.296
Today, our rifles are not sad.

01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:14.171
Our rifles are proud because we used it

01:33:14.255 --> 01:33:16.671
- to hit the enemy.
- To hit the enemy.

01:33:16.755 --> 01:33:17.796
That's right.

01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:19.296
I told you before

01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:21.713
that your weapon,
your rifle is your "husband".

01:33:21.796 --> 01:33:23.505
You take good care of your husband,

01:33:23.588 --> 01:33:26.046
your husband will take care of you.

01:33:26.130 --> 01:33:28.963
Even if your husband has no bullets,

01:33:29.046 --> 01:33:30.380
he can still take care of you.

01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:34.213
That is why we tell you to take good care

01:33:34.296 --> 01:33:36.463
of your husband at all times.

01:33:36.546 --> 01:33:37.546
Sir.

01:33:37.630 --> 01:33:38.963
Do you remember this?

01:33:39.838 --> 01:33:42.296
This is my catapult, not a toy.

01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:43.546
Because this is a…

01:33:43.630 --> 01:33:44.963
- Weapon.
- Yes.

01:33:45.046 --> 01:33:48.130
I can confirm that this is my weapon.

01:33:48.213 --> 01:33:50.421
Okay, put it down slowly.

01:33:50.505 --> 01:33:52.421
Sir, today, we really went through

01:33:52.505 --> 01:33:54.338
the unconventional way of fighting

01:33:54.421 --> 01:33:56.463
and I must tell you, it worked.

01:33:56.546 --> 01:33:58.130
And we saved our teammates' lives.

01:33:58.213 --> 01:33:59.546
Yes.

01:33:59.630 --> 01:34:02.088
You see? Unconventional methods work.

01:34:02.171 --> 01:34:04.046
Wars all over the world are being fought

01:34:04.130 --> 01:34:05.380
and soldiers are using

01:34:05.463 --> 01:34:07.796
conventional and unconventional methods

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:09.338
to overcome the enemy.

01:34:09.421 --> 01:34:12.796
And we must also learn
to use unconventional methods

01:34:13.505 --> 01:34:16.921
to protect our family and loved ones

01:34:17.005 --> 01:34:18.046
and our country.

01:34:18.130 --> 01:34:20.588
This was what we said
at the beginning, sir.

01:34:20.671 --> 01:34:22.421
- Is it?
- Yes, sir.

01:34:23.546 --> 01:34:25.171
Okay, yes. Good.
