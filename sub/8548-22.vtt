OUR TAXES.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.588
I WENT BACK
TO YOUR BROTHER.

16:31.058 --> 16:33.726
AFTER I SPECIFICALLY
ASKED YOU NOT TO?

16:35.528 --> 16:36.663
MM-HMM.

16:38.131 --> 16:41.401
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS
TO ME, HARRIETTE? HOW?

17:09.896 --> 17:11.231
COULD WE BE ALONE?

17:11.298 --> 17:13.766
SURE. EDDIE, WOULD YOU MIND
STEPPING OUTSIDE

17:13.833 --> 17:15.068
FOR A SECOND, PLEASE?

17:18.271 --> 17:21.874
NO, STEVE. I'D LIKE
TO BE ALONE WITH EDDIE.

OHH, I GET IT.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.945

17:26.012 --> 17:27.680

OUT OF HERE.

IT'S JUST A SCRATCH!

18:07.354 --> 18:09.989
I REALLY BLEW IT,
HUH, DAD?

18:10.056 --> 18:12.625
WELL, HOGGING THE SPOTLIGHT
LIKE YOU DID

18:12.692 --> 18:14.727
WASN'T EXACTLY THE BEST THING
YOU COULD DO.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.464
BUT I'M THE LEAD SINGER.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.966
I MEAN,
I DID WRITE THE SONG.

18:20.032 --> 18:23.203
WELL, SON,
THAT MAY BE TRUE,

18:23.270 --> 18:25.238
BUT BEING IN A BAND'S
A GROUP EFFORT.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.807
THAT MEANS
EVERYONE'S INCLUDED,

18:27.874 --> 18:29.242
EVEN THOUGH
IT WAS YOUR SONG.

18:30.443 --> 18:33.346
WHEN A MAN DECIDES
TO GO ON AN EGO TRIP,

18:33.413 --> 18:34.881
HE USUALLY ENDS UP
TRAVELING ALONE.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.351
SO WHAT
SHOULD I DO NOW?

18:39.619 --> 18:42.088
APOLOGIZING TO RODNEY
AND THE REST OF THE GUYS

18:42.155 --> 18:43.956
WOULD BE NICE
FOR STARTERS.

18:44.023 --> 18:45.592
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.260
AND WHO KNOWS?

18:47.327 --> 18:49.796
MAYBE YOU CAN EVEN
RESURRECT YOUR BAND.

18:49.862 --> 18:53.800
NO, KYLE'S GONE SOLO,
AND JERRY WENT WITH HIM.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.906
SO MUCH FOR MY CAREER
AS A ROCK STAR.

19:02.008 --> 19:06.446
WELL, SON,
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.748
THE IMPORTANT THING
IS THAT WE LEARN FROM THEM.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.551
THANKS, DAD.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.054
UH, EXCUSE ME.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.023
I FORGOT MY TRIPOD.

19:17.089 --> 19:19.592
JUST KEEP BONDING.
KEEP BONDING.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.231
YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW
I'M HERE.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.473
OOPS.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.485
DOES EDDIE STILL
HAVE AN ATTITUDE

19:45.552 --> 19:47.320
ABOUT MISSING
THAT VIDEO GIG?

19:47.387 --> 19:50.557
YEAH. HE'S STILL A MAN
WITHOUT A BAND.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.625
MAJOR BUMMER.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.963
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.331
WITH THE TALENT
WE HAVE HERE,

19:58.398 --> 20:00.700
WE COULD HELP EDDIE
MAKE A NEW VIDEO

20:00.767 --> 20:02.835
AND ENTER THE CONTEST.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.972
GOOD IDEA.
IT COULD BE FUN,

20:06.038 --> 20:08.741
AND WE MIGHT WIN
$1,000.

20:08.808 --> 20:09.776
I'M IN.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.778

TO ME.

20:11.844 --> 20:13.646

20:14.781 --> 20:16.082
I DON'T KNOW.

20:16.148 --> 20:18.251
EDDIE'S VERY DIFFICULT
TO WORK WITH.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.689
EDDIE, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.724

20:24.791 --> 20:26.893
ABOUT THE WHOLE FAMILY
MAKING A VIDEO?

20:28.194 --> 20:31.163
OKAY, BUT ONLY
ON ONE CONDITION.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.832
SEE, WHAT DID
I TELL YOU?

20:34.267 --> 20:36.303
I WANT AUNT RACHEL
TO REWRITE THE LYRICS.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.407
I'D BE HAPPY TO.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.542
I LOVE WORKING
WITH THIS GUY.

20:55.955 --> 20:58.525
WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT
TO FINISH IN THE TOP FIVE?

20:58.591 --> 21:00.560
ARE YOU KIDDING? WE GONNA WIN
THIS THING.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.462
WE GOT THIS PUPPY
LOCKED UP.

21:12.505 --> 21:15.174

HAVE A CHANCE.

21:15.241 --> 21:16.809

HAVE BEEN HEAVY METAL.

21:18.177 --> 21:20.079
