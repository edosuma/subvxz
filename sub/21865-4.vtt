20:04.841 --> 20:07.580
maybe it took a bit of time
to collect it all.

20:07.580 --> 20:08.782
RIGGS:
All right,
thanks, buddy.

20:08.782 --> 20:10.886
(sighs)
All right, fantastic.

20:10.886 --> 20:14.527
So we'll nominate Scorsese
for a coroner award.

20:14.527 --> 20:15.529
The Morguey.

20:15.529 --> 20:16.865
The Corpsey.

20:16.865 --> 20:17.833
The Stiffy.

20:17.833 --> 20:20.071
Mm. Think there's already
an award for them.

20:20.071 --> 20:21.641
(laughs):
Yeah.

20:21.641 --> 20:23.144
All right, so what
are we gonna do?

20:23.144 --> 20:25.616
We're gonna dangle Cooper
from a plane until he talks?

20:25.616 --> 20:27.452
Or convince Nora
to speak to him.

20:27.452 --> 20:28.989
I mean, if he's really sick...

20:28.989 --> 20:31.393
Rog, he's not sick,
and she's not gonna talk to him.

20:31.393 --> 20:33.532
Dad?

20:33.532 --> 20:36.403
Never underestimate
the bond

20:36.403 --> 20:37.640
between a father
and daughter.

20:37.640 --> 20:38.976
See? She visits me
at work.

20:38.976 --> 20:42.783
I don't think it's
a voluntary visit, Rog.

20:45.421 --> 20:47.660
♪ ♪

20:47.660 --> 20:49.129
What the hell?

20:49.129 --> 20:50.866
Is this a joke?

20:50.866 --> 20:52.636
'Cause I'm not laughing.

20:52.636 --> 20:56.811
I'm gonna let you work on that
unbreakable bond thing. Hey.

20:56.811 --> 20:59.049
Hey, Riggs.
Don't you wave
at him.

20:59.049 --> 21:01.453
What did you do?
That's your first question?

21:01.453 --> 21:04.459
Yes. Because usually people that
walk in here with handcuffs on

21:04.459 --> 21:05.696
did something.

21:05.696 --> 21:07.566
Bailey, what'd she do?

21:07.566 --> 21:09.570
A few kids at the zoo
got arrested,

21:09.570 --> 21:12.175
and a uni from booking
recognized Riana's last name

21:12.175 --> 21:13.545
and sent her up here.

21:13.545 --> 21:15.048
Arres... Arrested for what?

21:15.048 --> 21:17.853
For protesting the inhumane
treatment of animals.

21:17.853 --> 21:20.626
The mistreatment of animals?
It's a zoo!

21:20.626 --> 21:22.495
Whose stupid idea was this?

21:22.495 --> 21:23.865
I don't have
to tell you.

21:23.865 --> 21:26.838
I'm not gonna name names
for some... list.

21:26.838 --> 21:29.610
Riana, I'm your father,
and you...

21:29.610 --> 21:31.480
I know my rights.

21:33.652 --> 21:36.691
Okay, that's how this
is gonna happen?

21:36.691 --> 21:37.526
Mm‐hmm.

21:37.526 --> 21:40.966
Fine. Bailey,
read her her rights.

21:42.536 --> 21:43.872
And loosen up the cuffs‐‐

21:43.872 --> 21:46.009
you got that damn thing
a little too tight.

21:46.009 --> 21:49.717
RIGGS:
<i>Did you notice anything</i>

21:49.717 --> 21:51.019
out of the ordinary?

21:51.019 --> 21:53.592
Something that someone
might not report?

21:53.592 --> 21:55.729
It was chaotic.
Ask him.

21:55.729 --> 21:59.604
We did. He won't talk to us
unless you talk to him.

21:59.604 --> 22:02.442
What? No. Not interested.

22:02.442 --> 22:04.747
Can't you just whack him
a couple of times

22:04.747 --> 22:06.450
with a phone book?

22:06.450 --> 22:07.720
No.

22:07.720 --> 22:09.557
They don't make
phone books anymore,

22:09.557 --> 22:10.659
so, makes it difficult.

22:10.659 --> 22:13.197
Is your family
as messed up as mine?

22:13.197 --> 22:14.700
(laughs)

22:14.700 --> 22:16.069
Um... (clears throat)

22:16.069 --> 22:18.642
Listen, if I can find out
what it was that he took,

22:18.642 --> 22:20.044
than I'll have
a better understanding

22:20.044 --> 22:22.550
of who it is
that's trying to kill him.

22:22.550 --> 22:24.052
Or you could just
let them do it.

22:25.822 --> 22:27.960
It took me a long time
to get to a place

22:27.960 --> 22:30.799
where my father can't hurt me
or disappoint me

22:30.799 --> 22:32.970
or ruin my life, and
I'm finally there.

22:32.970 --> 22:35.274
He's not my father anymore.

22:35.274 --> 22:36.878
I'm over him.

22:39.617 --> 22:42.656
If you can't be
in the same room with him,

22:42.656 --> 22:44.694
you might not be over him.

22:46.598 --> 22:50.806
Okay, whose idea
was this protest?

22:50.806 --> 22:52.943
Write legibly, please.

22:57.318 --> 22:58.722
Okay, fine.

23:00.091 --> 23:02.596
We'll go
with an easier question.

23:02.596 --> 23:04.667
Who do you sit with at lunch?

23:04.667 --> 23:06.638
What does that have to do
with anything?

23:06.638 --> 23:09.710
Context, background.
Cop stuff.

23:09.710 --> 23:11.714
Who's in your
phone favorites?

23:11.714 --> 23:13.752
At dinner,
who are you texting?

23:13.752 --> 23:15.087
At night before you go to bed,

23:15.087 --> 23:16.958
I hear you on the phone,
laughing with somebody.

23:16.958 --> 23:18.695
Who is that someone, and what

23:18.695 --> 23:20.699
are you guys
laughing about?

23:20.699 --> 23:23.571
This is your dream come true,
isn't it?

23:23.571 --> 23:25.709
Put me in an interrogation room

23:25.709 --> 23:28.080
so you can find out every
little detail about my life.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.884
How else am I supposed to,
Riana?

23:29.884 --> 23:31.854
You don't tell me any of it.

23:31.854 --> 23:33.692
And your friends‐‐ they don't
come by the house anymore.

23:33.692 --> 23:35.762
They used to come by.
Why is that?
You don't want to know.

23:35.762 --> 23:37.766
I do want to know.
I'm asking, aren't I?
You hover!

23:37.766 --> 23:41.708
Okay, I don't have
friends over anymore

23:41.708 --> 23:43.878
because when
I do, you hover.

23:45.081 --> 23:47.251
I do not hover.

23:47.251 --> 23:48.888
Always. You always hover.

23:48.888 --> 23:51.761
You ask all these questions
and tell these corny jokes.

23:51.761 --> 23:52.996
My jokes are hilarious.

23:52.996 --> 23:54.800
Your friends used
to always laugh.

23:54.800 --> 23:55.902
Only because
they felt sorry for you,

23:55.902 --> 23:58.073
or they wanted you to leave.

23:58.073 --> 24:00.277
Yeah.
You know what, young lady?

24:00.277 --> 24:01.748
We are done here.

24:01.748 --> 24:04.018
Oh, and you're always
fishing for compliments.

24:04.018 --> 24:06.223
You pretend you're asking
for fashion advice...

24:06.223 --> 24:08.962
(rattling doorknob, knocking)
...but really, you're waiting
for someone to say,

24:08.962 --> 24:10.131
"No, Mr. Murtaugh, that shirt

24:10.131 --> 24:11.567
looks cool on you."
(knocking)

24:11.567 --> 24:12.669
Can someone open this door?

24:12.669 --> 24:14.740
But really it never looks cool.

24:14.740 --> 24:16.143
(knocking)
Bailey! Anyone!

24:16.143 --> 24:17.145
I am not done.

24:17.145 --> 24:18.882
I'm glad you're here, honey.

24:18.882 --> 24:20.351
Stop. This isn't
a reconciliation.

24:20.351 --> 24:22.723
It's about proving I had
nothing to do with this.

24:22.723 --> 24:25.896
And against my wishes, it's to
help find who wants to kill you.

24:25.896 --> 24:29.904
Eli Woodcock
sitting in 1A.

24:31.273 --> 24:33.645
What did you take from him
before you shot him?

24:33.645 --> 24:35.649
(laughing):
Man, why are you making me
the bad guy?

24:35.649 --> 24:37.318
I don't ever load my gun.
Everybody knows that.

24:37.318 --> 24:39.857
Honey, tell him. Come on.
That's my move.

24:39.857 --> 24:41.661
Yeah, that's his move.

24:41.661 --> 24:43.798
Along with being a
crappy, unreliable father.

24:43.798 --> 24:46.771
But consistent.

24:46.771 --> 24:47.940
He didn't have anything.

24:47.940 --> 24:49.977
He had a mediocre watch and
less than 100 bucks in cash.

24:49.977 --> 24:51.246
What am I gonna
take from him?

24:51.246 --> 24:52.749
So why'd he
come after you?

24:53.952 --> 24:55.087
Really?

24:55.087 --> 24:58.060
A flight attendant for the rich?
Who the hell are you...?

24:58.060 --> 24:59.830
That's what you want
to do with your life?

24:59.830 --> 25:02.301
What I wanted was
to get away from you,

25:02.301 --> 25:04.038
see the world, go to Fiji.

25:04.038 --> 25:05.809
Have you been
there yet?
Oh.

25:05.809 --> 25:08.848
Hey. (clears throat) Hey, guys,
can we just stay focused?

25:08.848 --> 25:10.117
Mr. Cooper?

25:10.117 --> 25:11.721
Yeah.
1A.

25:11.721 --> 25:13.691
You took something
from everyone else.

25:13.691 --> 25:15.060
What did you take
from him?

25:18.367 --> 25:20.404
Briefcase.

25:20.404 --> 25:21.807
(clears throat)
I took...

25:21.807 --> 25:23.210
I took... I took his briefcase.

25:23.210 --> 25:25.281
Beautiful. Where's
the briefcase?

25:25.281 --> 25:26.751
(clears throat)

25:26.751 --> 25:29.355
It's in the... Yeah.

25:30.659 --> 25:31.894
(Riggs clears
throat)

25:31.894 --> 25:32.996
Mr. Cooper?
What?

25:32.996 --> 25:34.733
Where's the briefcase?

25:34.733 --> 25:36.436
In a pond.
What pond?

25:36.436 --> 25:39.442
The one by where I landed.

25:39.442 --> 25:41.079
Dad?!

25:41.079 --> 25:42.214
(groaning)

25:42.214 --> 25:44.152
Dad?

25:44.152 --> 25:45.922
Knock it off.
This isn't funny!

25:45.922 --> 25:47.926
(coughing)

25:47.926 --> 25:49.763
Can we get an EMT in here?!

25:49.763 --> 25:51.399
Dad?
(coughing)

25:57.913 --> 25:59.783
WOMAN:
It's an invasive myocarditis.

25:59.783 --> 26:02.088
Now that's a... it's a viral
infection of the heart tissue.

26:02.088 --> 26:03.725
His heart functions
are shutting down.

26:03.725 --> 26:07.833
Can you operate, or treat it
with statins, beta‐blockers?

26:07.833 --> 26:09.369
No. Uh, the damage
is irreversible.

26:11.272 --> 26:13.911
How long does he have?

26:13.911 --> 26:16.116
Six months?

26:18.020 --> 26:20.124
Could be longer
with a little luck.

26:20.124 --> 26:22.829
I'm sorry.

26:22.829 --> 26:25.735
Thank you, Doc.

26:27.906 --> 26:30.144
Why don't you go to him?

26:31.947 --> 26:34.285
Could be the thing
his heart needs right now.

26:45.942 --> 26:48.013
Hey.

26:48.013 --> 26:50.017
Hey.

26:50.017 --> 26:52.789
How you doing?

26:52.789 --> 26:57.532
The good news is, I have an
inordinately healthy appendix.

26:57.532 --> 26:59.536
(laughs)

26:59.536 --> 27:01.741
(sniffles)

27:05.715 --> 27:09.088
(siren wails in distance)

27:09.990 --> 27:12.161
What's up, Cap?

27:12.161 --> 27:15.067
Other Cap. You
guys call me?

27:15.067 --> 27:17.204
Can you, uh,
take a seat, Detective?

27:20.077 --> 27:22.883
Can you tell us
where you were last night?

27:22.883 --> 27:25.387
Usually, I cannot,
but, uh, last night, yeah.

27:25.387 --> 27:27.024
I was at the trailer
cleaning up.

27:27.024 --> 27:28.360
Place is really spacious

27:28.360 --> 27:30.097
once I get all
the clutter out.

27:30.097 --> 27:31.834
So, anyway, I'm thinking about
doing, like, an Airbnb deal...

27:31.834 --> 27:33.336
Did you rob a liquor store
in Echo Park?

27:33.336 --> 27:35.340
(sucking through straw)

27:35.340 --> 27:38.079
Last night?

27:38.079 --> 27:39.850
No.

27:39.850 --> 27:41.085
What's going on?

27:41.085 --> 27:42.421
A Winchester '94,

27:42.421 --> 27:44.358
registered in your name,
was found at the scene.

27:47.031 --> 27:48.333
Uh, listen.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.103
Yesterday... (clears throat)

27:50.103 --> 27:51.974
...along with many other items,

27:51.974 --> 27:54.245
I took the said Winchester
down to a pawn shop,

27:54.245 --> 27:56.984
and I traded it...

27:56.984 --> 27:58.420
for this nifty little item here.

27:58.420 --> 28:00.959
You sold it
at a pawn shop?

28:00.959 --> 28:02.929
A rifle you never disclosed
was in your possession?

28:02.929 --> 28:04.365
No, no, no,
I traded it.
Riggs,

28:04.365 --> 28:06.102
have you even read
the LAPD policy

28:06.102 --> 28:07.806
regarding
personal firearms?

28:07.806 --> 28:09.776
I loved it. It's a little slow
in the middle,

28:09.776 --> 28:11.012
but it really picked up towards

28:11.012 --> 28:12.214
the end,
you know?

28:12.214 --> 28:13.350
See, this is what
I'm talking about.

28:13.350 --> 28:14.485
Where are we on
the case, Riggs?

28:14.485 --> 28:16.456
Ah, so, turns out

28:16.456 --> 28:18.360
the Chinatown shooters were
after the briefcase.

28:18.360 --> 28:20.464
The one that Cooper ditched
after he jumped.

28:20.464 --> 28:22.034
Why? What's in the briefcase?

28:22.034 --> 28:23.537
Well, I called
Woodcock's employer.

28:23.537 --> 28:26.175
Apparently, he was returning
from a mine in Venezuela.

28:26.175 --> 28:29.115
He had two million dollars
in uncut diamonds in the case.

28:29.115 --> 28:31.119
But

28:31.119 --> 28:32.388
not to worry.

28:32.388 --> 28:34.526
LAPD's finest is on the case.

28:45.280 --> 28:47.017
(muffled):
I put my flippers on too early.

28:47.017 --> 28:49.021
I... I can't understand you,
Bowman.

28:49.021 --> 28:51.092
I put my flippers on too early.

28:51.092 --> 28:53.029
You need to walk me
to the water.

28:54.098 --> 28:55.835
Thanks.

28:58.574 --> 29:00.377
(brakes squeaking)

29:00.377 --> 29:03.116
I can't believe I'm actually
diving for buried treasure.

29:03.116 --> 29:06.422
Bailey?
Bailey?!

29:06.422 --> 29:08.527
I watched the
surveillance footage,

29:08.527 --> 29:10.497
and the briefcase
isn't here.

29:10.497 --> 29:12.569
Your guy ran right past
the camera, clear as day,

29:12.569 --> 29:14.171
with the briefcase still
in his arms.

29:14.171 --> 29:16.309
And he kept
running.

29:24.191 --> 29:25.460
(groans)

29:25.460 --> 29:28.033
Bailey? Bailey, I can't get up.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.072
(sighs)

29:31.072 --> 29:32.207
He lied to us.

29:32.207 --> 29:35.080
He still has
that briefcase.

29:35.080 --> 29:36.449
Mr. Cooper?

29:42.127 --> 29:44.331
Well,

29:44.331 --> 29:46.069
at least he doesn't
need a parachute

29:46.069 --> 29:47.939
to go out the
second‐floor window.

29:51.345 --> 29:52.347
This is Nora's.

29:52.347 --> 29:54.485
(truck horn blares)

29:58.259 --> 30:01.399
Hey? Don't I know you?

30:01.399 --> 30:03.369
I don't think so.

30:03.369 --> 30:06.042
Yeah, you're the‐the...
flight attendant

30:06.042 --> 30:08.146
from the plane
that my brother was killed on.

30:08.146 --> 30:11.052
What are you doing here?

30:11.052 --> 30:12.421
Following you.

30:12.421 --> 30:13.524
(tires squealing)

30:13.524 --> 30:16.563
No. No! No!

30:16.563 --> 30:17.999
MAN:
Let's go!

30:19.569 --> 30:21.372
(phone ringing)

30:22.274 --> 30:24.445
Hello?

30:24.445 --> 30:27.451
Um, Dad, it's me.

30:27.451 --> 30:30.223
Hey. Did you lose an earring?

30:30.223 --> 30:31.492
Um, listen to me.

30:31.492 --> 30:35.300
They're gonna hurt me unless
you get them the briefcase.

30:35.300 --> 30:38.106
Tell them that I'll bring it.

30:38.106 --> 30:39.441
When and where?

30:39.441 --> 30:43.016
Um, tomorrow noon,
Echo Park Lake.

30:43.016 --> 30:45.053
You will bring it, right, Dad?

30:45.053 --> 30:46.690
(Nora breathes loudly
over phone)

30:46.690 --> 30:48.426
I won't let you down, Nora.

30:48.426 --> 30:50.565
I promise.

30:57.344 --> 30:58.747
Hey, Dugan?

30:59.749 --> 31:01.385
Don't tell me you guys are
looking for Cooper again.

31:01.385 --> 31:03.389
Yeah, and the panda
was defective.

31:03.389 --> 31:05.661
Look, guys,
I haven't seen Coop since...

31:05.661 --> 31:07.297
Hey, look, we're gonna
skip the part where

31:07.297 --> 31:08.701
you lied to us
and jump right ahead

31:08.701 --> 31:10.671
to where you pull out
your phone and call him.

31:10.671 --> 31:11.873
(laughs)

31:11.873 --> 31:15.581
The people who tried to kill
Cooper‐‐ they now have Nora.

31:27.672 --> 31:29.542
(sighs)

31:35.287 --> 31:37.224
(phone ringing)

31:40.163 --> 31:42.301
Dugan?

31:42.301 --> 31:44.706
No, it's your good friends
at the LAPD.

31:44.706 --> 31:46.510
That briefcase

31:46.510 --> 31:48.479
you stole‐‐
the guys want it back.

31:48.479 --> 31:50.483
They have Nora,
and they're not messing around.

31:50.483 --> 31:52.087
Listen to me, Cooper.
We have to drop

31:52.087 --> 31:54.491
the briefcase in Echo Park
tomorrow at noon.

31:54.491 --> 31:56.429
Look, you know what these
guys are capable of.

31:56.429 --> 31:58.232
MURTAUGH:
And, hey,

31:58.232 --> 32:00.337
thinking about running
doesn't make you a bad father.

32:00.337 --> 32:02.140
Actually doing it?

32:02.140 --> 32:04.813
Well, there's not enough
diamonds in the world.

32:04.813 --> 32:06.817
(sighs)

32:06.817 --> 32:10.290
You have the wrong number.

32:15.634 --> 32:17.772
(crowd chatter,
lively music playing)

32:24.251 --> 32:26.656
RIGGS:
Don't do it, Rog.

32:26.656 --> 32:30.397
A panda you buy doesn't feel
the same as a panda you win.

32:30.397 --> 32:33.269
How's the view up there?

32:33.269 --> 32:35.574
No Nora, no bad guy.

32:35.574 --> 32:37.645
No Cooper.

32:37.645 --> 32:40.751
My guess? Father of the year
took his last score

32:40.751 --> 32:42.254
and hit the road.

32:42.254 --> 32:43.489
Trust me. He'll be here.

32:43.489 --> 32:46.295
It's what fathers do;
it's built in.

32:46.295 --> 32:48.634
Yeah. Not all fathers
are like you, Rog.

32:48.634 --> 32:51.773
Well, obviously, there are
standard bearers in the field.

32:51.773 --> 32:53.409
Uh, there's Avery.

32:53.409 --> 32:56.382
Technically, not a father,
but..

32:56.382 --> 32:57.885
I guess he's a father figure.

32:57.885 --> 33:00.490
No. Avery and Gina.

33:00.490 --> 33:03.664
Someone call for backup?

33:03.664 --> 33:07.337
I wanted Bowman and Bailey,
not Gina.

33:07.337 --> 33:08.841
I didn't want a distraction.

33:08.841 --> 33:11.412
Probably enough caffeine,
Detective, don't you think?

33:11.412 --> 33:12.715
Clock's ticking and everything.

33:14.318 --> 33:15.888
Oh, look at that.

33:15.888 --> 33:17.692
Told you, it's built in.

33:17.692 --> 33:20.396
That your partner
you're talking to?

33:21.733 --> 33:24.171
Tell him not to miss.

33:24.171 --> 33:26.342
Cooper says "Do not miss."

33:26.342 --> 33:27.845
I agree with Cooper.

33:27.845 --> 33:29.214
RIGGS:
Hey, Cap.

33:29.214 --> 33:30.450
How long you been listening in?

33:30.450 --> 33:32.454
Long enough to know you both
think of me as a father figure.

33:32.454 --> 33:33.790
What's the plan?

33:33.790 --> 33:35.426
In situations like this,

33:35.426 --> 33:36.495
I usually give
them free reign.

33:36.495 --> 33:38.399
And that's exactly why I'm here.

33:38.399 --> 33:39.334
The plan?

33:39.334 --> 33:41.472
Sending Cooper in now.

33:41.472 --> 33:43.442
Avery. You and Gina close in,

33:43.442 --> 33:45.380
but keep a distance.

33:45.380 --> 33:46.750
We're going in.

33:46.750 --> 33:47.818
Okay.

34:03.316 --> 34:04.686
Drop the case.

34:04.686 --> 34:05.854
Walk away.

34:09.494 --> 34:11.432
Where's my daughter?

34:11.432 --> 34:13.637
Give me the case,
wait 30 minutes.

34:13.637 --> 34:14.939
Ah.

34:14.939 --> 34:16.408
I'll let her go.

34:16.408 --> 34:18.614
It's not gonna happen that way.

34:19.816 --> 34:21.418
Captain, we're
gonna lose the girl.

34:21.418 --> 34:23.523
AVERY: Let them handle this.
Don't move.

34:23.523 --> 34:24.892
Back his play.

34:24.892 --> 34:27.430
Okay, stop!

34:27.430 --> 34:29.368
She's here.

34:30.904 --> 34:32.273
Where?

34:32.273 --> 34:34.846
The van.

34:44.264 --> 34:45.567
Rog.

34:45.567 --> 34:47.605
I don't have an angle on Nora.

34:57.692 --> 34:59.962
You let my daughter go
and you can have this case.

34:59.962 --> 35:01.866
Drop the case now
or they kill her.

35:01.866 --> 35:04.639
(laughing):
We can do this all day.

35:07.912 --> 35:09.347
We need to move in.

35:09.347 --> 35:10.216
Wait, wait, wait.
RIGGS: Avery.

35:10.216 --> 35:12.888
Avery, tell Gina to move.
What? Riggs.

35:12.888 --> 35:15.259
You're breaking up. You're
breaking up. I've lost comms.

35:15.259 --> 35:18.332
Riggs, comm's down.
What's the play?

35:23.275 --> 35:27.484
Rog. The guys that are with
Nora, they're yours.

35:27.484 --> 35:29.287
What do you mean, they're mine?

35:29.287 --> 35:30.891
When we get fired,

35:30.891 --> 35:33.496
just remember this is
the only shot I had.

35:39.976 --> 35:41.546
(screaming)

35:47.958 --> 35:49.595
(grunting)

35:49.595 --> 35:50.998
Don't move.

35:50.998 --> 35:52.500
Dad!

35:52.500 --> 35:53.904
You're under arrest.

35:58.445 --> 36:00.684
Can I move now?

36:00.684 --> 36:02.655
Nice shootin', Rog.

36:02.655 --> 36:07.497
Yeah. I think someone owes us
both a giant panda.

36:13.042 --> 36:16.381
Thanks for saving my daughter's
life and what's left of mine.

36:16.381 --> 36:17.518
My pleasure.

36:17.518 --> 36:20.423
But in saying that, we're
gonna do two sets of cuffs.

36:20.423 --> 36:22.695
Right. Understood.

36:22.695 --> 36:26.501
Can I just hug
my girl first?

36:26.501 --> 36:28.005
No earrings this time.

36:28.005 --> 36:30.476
Yeah.

36:36.455 --> 36:38.627
I'm sorry I've been

36:38.627 --> 36:40.096
such a piss‐poor father.

36:40.096 --> 36:41.799
There's still time.

36:49.649 --> 36:50.951
Did you just put this
in my pocket?

36:50.951 --> 36:52.855
(stammers)
We're surrounded by police.

36:52.855 --> 36:54.491
What's wrong with you?
COOPER: What's wrong with me?

36:54.491 --> 36:55.694
This whole thing
has been for you.

36:55.694 --> 36:56.596
Just a token of my love for...

36:56.596 --> 36:58.533
No. I take it back
I take it all back.

36:58.533 --> 37:00.436
You're unfixable, Dad.

37:00.436 --> 37:02.373
Nora, no. But I'm consistent.

37:02.373 --> 37:04.444
(laughs)

37:06.983 --> 37:09.922
She still called me "Dad."

37:11.358 --> 37:13.530
You know, Cooper.

37:13.530 --> 37:15.499
As far as dads go...

37:17.103 --> 37:19.441
...I've seen worse.

37:30.998 --> 37:32.601
(door opens)

37:34.471 --> 37:36.676
Drinking to a
successful mission?

37:36.676 --> 37:38.747
One inch, Avery.

37:38.747 --> 37:42.755
One inch to the left and
this mission ends differently.

37:42.755 --> 37:45.827
Usually a narrow
margin with these guys.

37:45.827 --> 37:49.134
I can't argue with the result,
but you know this is insane.

37:49.134 --> 37:50.837
If you still
want to fire me...

37:50.837 --> 37:52.508
This isn't about
saving your job,

37:52.508 --> 37:54.612
this is about
saving your life.

37:54.612 --> 37:56.481
I don't know anybody
that could do what you do

37:56.481 --> 37:58.753
and still be breathing.

37:58.753 --> 38:01.491
Thank you.

38:01.491 --> 38:03.462
Say the word and I will
have you transferred

38:03.462 --> 38:04.899
to a post of your choosing.

38:04.899 --> 38:06.836
(sighs)

38:08.706 --> 38:11.646
I appreciate that,
I really do, but...

38:11.646 --> 38:14.618
These lunatics are going
to bring the walls down

38:14.618 --> 38:17.390
and nobody's gonna
get out alive.

38:17.390 --> 38:19.127
But you want to stay.

38:19.127 --> 38:20.697
Why?

38:20.697 --> 38:23.503
They're my lunatics.

38:25.607 --> 38:27.744
(crickets chirp, dog barks
in distance)

38:31.519 --> 38:32.721
MURTAUGH:
Hey.

38:32.721 --> 38:34.457
Thought you was going out?

38:34.457 --> 38:35.927
Oh, my friends
are flaking.

38:35.927 --> 38:37.029
They're always late.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.939
Yeah. That was for you,

38:41.939 --> 38:43.776
but I realized that, uh,

38:43.776 --> 38:45.580
you've outgrown big,
fluffy things,

38:45.580 --> 38:48.620
so he's mine now.
(laughs)

38:49.688 --> 38:51.158
Hey, look, Ri.

38:51.158 --> 38:53.663
Uh, your mother doesn't
come home until tomorrow.

38:53.663 --> 38:56.001
We still got time for that
hibachi thing.

38:56.001 --> 38:57.003
You know?

38:57.003 --> 39:00.677
Or we could, um, stay
in and watch a movie?

39:00.677 --> 39:04.852
Um, I wish I could, Dad, but
I think we're getting dinner.

39:04.852 --> 39:07.456
Yeah.

39:09.628 --> 39:11.632
(doorbell rings)

39:11.632 --> 39:14.037
Ooh.
(chuckles)

39:16.441 --> 39:18.145
Hey, guys.

39:18.145 --> 39:19.682
You ready to go?

39:21.986 --> 39:24.792
Hey, you guys want
to lay low tonight?

39:24.792 --> 39:26.629
You know, order in,
watch a movie?

39:26.629 --> 39:29.000
Sure. Is it cool
with your dad?

39:30.169 --> 39:32.507
Absolutely.

39:32.507 --> 39:34.077
You can actually take
the big TV.

39:34.077 --> 39:35.780
Don't "take it" take it.

39:35.780 --> 39:38.653
And I only say that because
there's a felon in the house.

39:38.653 --> 39:40.523
(laughing)
(Riana sighs)

39:40.523 --> 39:42.527
Yeah, okay, Dad.
Good one.

39:45.667 --> 39:49.608
Oh, yep. I'm getting
out of your way.

39:50.744 --> 39:52.781
Oh, Dad.
Mm‐hmm?

39:52.781 --> 39:53.983
Leave the panda.

39:55.085 --> 39:58.258
Oh, yep.

39:58.258 --> 40:00.229
Put him there.
