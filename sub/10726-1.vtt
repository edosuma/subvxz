00:00.518 --> 00:03.304
This is he story of
my family... The O'Neals.

00:03.339 --> 00:05.006
We just came from church.

00:05.008 --> 00:06.674
As always, we're on our best behavior,

00:06.676 --> 00:10.378
and that's 100% due to my mom, Eileen.

00:10.396 --> 00:12.480
Kenny. Four on the floor.

00:12.515 --> 00:13.848
Sorry.

00:13.850 --> 00:15.483
Yep. I'm the rebel.

00:15.518 --> 00:17.435
What a lovely family.

00:17.486 --> 00:18.486
Aren't they?

00:18.521 --> 00:19.641
What I can get for you, sir?

00:19.655 --> 00:21.272
Jimmy will have the
skinless chicken breast

00:21.323 --> 00:22.363
with the steamed broccoli.

00:22.408 --> 00:24.025
He has to make weight
for his wrestling match.

00:24.076 --> 00:25.527
St. Barclay's.

00:25.578 --> 00:26.861
Go, bulldogs!

00:26.912 --> 00:28.637
- And for you, Si...
- My husband will have the salmon

00:28.664 --> 00:30.031
with a lemon wedge.

00:30.082 --> 00:32.283
Can't have meat and
potatoes for every meal.

00:32.334 --> 00:33.668
Not till I'm in heaven.

00:33.702 --> 00:36.704
Also, could you donate your tips
to poor children in Ethiopia?

00:36.706 --> 00:38.456
Shannon, honey, don't be pushy.

00:38.507 --> 00:41.376
Karen needs to make
her own moral decisions.

00:41.378 --> 00:42.960
It's her soul that's going to hell

00:43.012 --> 00:44.212
if she doesn't give you money.

00:44.263 --> 00:45.713
My shift just started.

00:45.764 --> 00:49.100
My mom always told us to behave
as if Jesus were watching.

00:49.134 --> 00:50.802
What are you getting, Kenny?

00:50.853 --> 00:53.688
Uh, she usually just
orders for me, so...

00:53.722 --> 00:54.939
Smart.

00:54.973 --> 00:56.307
I'm gonna let her order for me, too,

00:56.358 --> 00:58.359
but then I'm just gonna
turn it into whatever I want.

00:58.394 --> 00:59.527
Mm. That's the life.

00:59.561 --> 01:02.313
Jesus wasn't really there, you guys,

01:02.364 --> 01:03.564
but you get it.

01:03.566 --> 01:05.366
We were different than other families.

01:06.618 --> 01:08.953
But I was about to change all that.

01:08.987 --> 01:10.872
We were gonna go from this...

01:10.939 --> 01:11.956
To this.

01:11.990 --> 01:13.908
Use your core. Use your core!

01:13.910 --> 01:15.159
They're coming for us!

01:15.210 --> 01:16.544
Shannon is doing nothing!

01:16.578 --> 01:18.179
Oh, where the hell is the  car?!

01:21.444 --> 01:22.750
Aaaaaaaaah!

01:24.169 --> 01:25.803
The wheels started to fall off

01:25.838 --> 01:28.639
the night before our church's
biggest fundraiser...

01:28.674 --> 01:30.007
Bingo bonanza.

01:30.058 --> 01:31.592
My mom was chair of the event.

01:31.643 --> 01:34.011
It combined two of the
things she loved the most...

01:34.062 --> 01:35.854
Serving the church
and having everyone

01:35.879 --> 01:37.462
watch her do it.

01:37.482 --> 01:38.899
That is how you make

01:38.934 --> 01:43.271
an easy nine-finger
articulated medallion bow.

01:43.322 --> 01:46.107
My dad was bringing home
the mother of all donations

01:46.109 --> 01:48.943
and the donation my mother
cared about most of all...

01:48.994 --> 01:50.778
A ride-along with the Chicago P.D.

01:50.829 --> 01:52.029
I didn't get the ride-along.

01:52.080 --> 01:53.531
What?! Why not?

01:53.582 --> 01:55.950
Because apparently, we're
being sued after the last one.

01:56.001 --> 01:56.730
You think

01:56.755 --> 01:57.642
you're so tough up there?

01:57.669 --> 01:59.620
Why? 'Cause you're
protected by this cage?

02:00.790 --> 02:02.289
Well, I'm-a find you, dentist!

02:02.291 --> 02:04.211
I'm-a find you, I'm-a kill you!

02:04.259 --> 02:06.427
Don't listen to him. He's a drama queen.

02:06.461 --> 02:08.294
You think I'm playin', son?!

02:09.848 --> 02:10.965
What about the silent auction?

02:10.967 --> 02:12.349
The ride-along was our big-ticket item.

02:12.384 --> 02:13.717
Now we don't have our big-ticket item.

02:13.769 --> 02:15.052
Jodi.

02:15.103 --> 02:16.303
It's okay.

02:16.305 --> 02:18.105
I didn't get to be chair
of the bingo bonanza

02:18.140 --> 02:19.223
by losing my cool.

02:19.274 --> 02:20.441
Hmm?

02:20.475 --> 02:22.443
Pat. Since you couldn't
get the ride-along,

02:22.477 --> 02:24.979
I think there's something
else we could auction off.

02:25.030 --> 02:26.030
Not my canoe!

02:26.031 --> 02:27.565
We've had this thing for seven years,

02:27.616 --> 02:29.316
and it's never even touched water.

02:29.318 --> 02:30.818
But it could.

02:30.820 --> 02:33.153
And look, I hope this
doesn't sound too extreme,

02:33.204 --> 02:35.623
but this canoe symbolizes
all my hopes and dreams.

02:35.657 --> 02:37.157
I bet we could get 3 grand for it.

02:37.159 --> 02:38.125
Eileen!

02:38.159 --> 02:40.044
Let's talk about it.

02:40.078 --> 02:41.795
We never talk about
things, and then I end up

02:41.830 --> 02:43.510
getting railroaded
into giving up my canoe.

02:43.548 --> 02:44.581
Okay.

02:44.632 --> 02:47.167
But I invited the
bishop to bingo bonanza.

02:47.169 --> 02:49.253
I was hoping that he'd
see how generous we are

02:49.304 --> 02:50.671
and then he'd write a recommendation

02:50.673 --> 02:51.839
for Jimmy to go to Notre Dame

02:51.890 --> 02:53.330
so he wouldn't end up living with us

02:53.341 --> 02:55.175
for the rest of his life
because he's a little dumb.

02:55.226 --> 02:56.560
See that?

02:56.594 --> 02:58.729
That's Irish-Catholic jedi mind control.

02:58.763 --> 03:00.314
This is tremendous.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.516
Eileen, I'd like to
honor all your hard work

03:02.518 --> 03:04.852
by featuring the O'Neals
in the church bulletin.

03:04.854 --> 03:07.020
So do you have a recent family photo?

03:07.022 --> 03:08.355
Of course I do.

03:08.357 --> 03:09.857
I'll get you a flash drive.

03:09.859 --> 03:11.825
While Father Phil was looking through

03:11.860 --> 03:13.944
1,000 of the exact same photos,

03:13.995 --> 03:16.613
I was in my bedroom with
my handsy girlfriend, Mimi.

03:16.664 --> 03:17.998
I love Peta.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.370
Mm. But...

03:23.421 --> 03:24.871
We have been dating for six months,

03:24.923 --> 03:27.424
and you have never once
pressured me to have sex.

03:27.458 --> 03:29.042
Which is why I want to have sex.

03:30.128 --> 03:32.179
Uh, b-but Father Phil is downstairs,

03:32.213 --> 03:33.547
and he's wearing his collar.

03:33.598 --> 03:35.132
I don't care. I'm half-Jewish.

03:37.051 --> 03:38.685
Whoa.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.887
Uh, that's 48 condoms.

03:40.938 --> 03:42.472
12 didn't seem like enough.

03:42.523 --> 03:46.059
Are you sure you
understand how they work?

03:46.061 --> 03:47.194
Kenny.

03:47.228 --> 03:49.396
Okay. Okay. Okay.

03:49.447 --> 03:51.031
Where are you going?

03:51.065 --> 03:52.649
Um...

03:52.700 --> 03:53.817
To put one of these on.

03:53.868 --> 03:54.988
But you can do that in here.

03:55.036 --> 03:56.570
But...

03:56.572 --> 03:58.738
I want to make an
entrance,  So...

04:03.377 --> 04:05.245
Okay.

04:05.247 --> 04:06.963
Okay.

04:06.998 --> 04:08.331
I can do this.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.217
I can do this.

04:11.636 --> 04:12.676
What's the problem?

04:12.720 --> 04:14.721
Why am I so nervous?

04:14.755 --> 04:17.154
I don't know. Why do you think?

04:21.178 --> 04:23.563
What are you doing in my
mirror, shirtless cologne model?

04:23.597 --> 04:24.848
You tell me.

04:24.899 --> 04:26.433
Hey.

04:27.518 --> 04:28.518
Come out, Kenny!

04:28.569 --> 04:30.969
Yeah, Kenny. Why don't you come out?

04:31.856 --> 04:33.940
I can't come out. Have
you ever met my mom?

04:33.942 --> 04:36.026
She put a statue of the
Virgin Mary over the toilet

04:36.077 --> 04:37.694
so we'd put the seat down.

04:37.745 --> 04:38.662
That's intense.

04:38.696 --> 04:40.530
You're intense.

04:41.582 --> 04:44.918
No, but it will literally kill her.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.753
So...

04:46.787 --> 04:49.005
I can't be gay... ever.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.541
I need to learn how to
do it... With a girl.

04:51.592 --> 04:52.952
Straight sex.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.201
I can do this.

04:55.212 --> 04:56.963
Do you have it on yet? Does it fit?

04:57.014 --> 04:58.214
Nope. Can't do this.

04:59.968 --> 05:02.208
That's a... bad idea, man.

05:03.020 --> 05:04.721
I'm out of here.

05:04.772 --> 05:05.972
Wait! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

05:05.974 --> 05:07.390
Ohh! Oh, god.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.442
No!

05:09.476 --> 05:10.560
Oh, god.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.565
Uggggggh!

05:18.702 --> 05:20.502
Come on, girl. Help me out.

05:21.539 --> 05:23.539
I finally got the bow right!

05:25.000 --> 05:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:38.806 --> 05:41.307
We're still in the
bulletin, though, right?

05:42.241 --> 05:44.849
The good news is, almost
everyone was blinded

05:44.850 --> 05:47.005
by plaster dust and
didn't see the condoms.

05:47.056 --> 05:48.390
The bad news is

05:48.424 --> 05:51.226
my mom was now convinced
that I'd sinned with Mimi.

05:51.260 --> 05:52.293
Where's our regular plumber?

05:52.328 --> 05:53.595
I had to call in a stranger.

05:53.597 --> 05:55.647
We need to keep this
Kenny thing contained.

05:55.681 --> 05:57.348
You know how gossipy plumbers are.

05:57.399 --> 05:58.399
Hey.

06:00.019 --> 06:01.986
What do you think Mom's gonna do to me?

06:02.021 --> 06:03.188
Who cares?

06:03.239 --> 06:04.439
What did Mimi do to you?

06:04.441 --> 06:06.491
Oh. Just... you know,

06:06.525 --> 06:09.410
just... all that sex
stuff that drives us wild.

06:09.445 --> 06:11.279
Yeah! She did, man!

06:12.755 --> 06:14.616
No matter what she tells
you, you're not going to hell.

06:14.618 --> 06:15.533
Trust me.

06:15.584 --> 06:17.535
If everything she said was true,

06:17.586 --> 06:19.287
I would be so blind by now.

06:20.506 --> 06:23.041
Whoa! She looks pissed.

06:23.092 --> 06:24.092
Good luck.

06:24.126 --> 06:25.460
Just let me take the lead. Please?

06:25.462 --> 06:26.961
Be my guest. Go right ahead.

06:26.963 --> 06:28.713
Okay, so, some things
happened last night

06:28.764 --> 06:30.284
that I think we need to talk about.

06:30.299 --> 06:31.966
You are in a heap of trouble, young man.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.551
I know out in the rest of the world,

06:33.602 --> 06:36.137
kids are humping to hip-hop,
but not in this house.

06:36.139 --> 06:37.221
Eileen.

06:37.272 --> 06:39.140
Father Phil was here... In his collar!

06:39.142 --> 06:40.892
I told Mimi that, but she
was unmoved by that argument.

06:40.943 --> 06:42.110
Zip it!

06:42.144 --> 06:44.195
I have a lot more statues
of the Blessed Virgin

06:44.229 --> 06:45.813
in the basement, Kenny... Big ones.

06:45.815 --> 06:47.148
Let me tell you how this ends.

06:47.150 --> 06:48.983
- Here it comes.
- If you get Mimi pregnant,

06:49.034 --> 06:50.902
then you won't be able
to go to Northwestern

06:50.953 --> 06:52.820
and become the youngest
judge in Illinois history,

06:52.871 --> 06:54.622
like we always talked about.

06:54.656 --> 06:56.407
And I want that for you.

06:56.458 --> 06:57.825
Because you're my favorite.

06:57.827 --> 06:59.410
Eileen!

06:59.461 --> 07:01.162
Fine. Sure.

07:01.164 --> 07:03.297
They're all my favorites.

07:05.217 --> 07:06.334
Hey, Jodi. Thanks.

07:06.336 --> 07:07.969
How's things after last night?

07:08.003 --> 07:09.303
- Things are good.
- Good.

07:09.338 --> 07:11.839
Because I just got out of
cardio salsa at the church,

07:11.841 --> 07:14.091
and people were talking
about Kenny and Mimi.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.176
What?

07:15.178 --> 07:16.844
Guess who was yammering on the most.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.479
Marcia bleeping Worthman.

07:18.513 --> 07:22.516
Well, apparently, they
found Mimi in her underwear

07:22.567 --> 07:25.686
with hundreds of Kenny's
condoms plugging their pipes.

07:25.688 --> 07:26.937
Are you kidding?

07:26.988 --> 07:28.489
No. Those moves are hard.

07:28.523 --> 07:30.191
I think I pulled my vagina muscle.

07:30.242 --> 07:31.575
Do women have groins?

07:31.610 --> 07:32.693
This is nice.

07:32.695 --> 07:34.278
Well, now everyone's gonna know.

07:34.329 --> 07:35.863
We need to nip this in the bud.

07:35.865 --> 07:37.665
I agree. So I was thinking...

07:37.699 --> 07:39.116
I have this cousin back in Philly

07:39.167 --> 07:42.002
with a very questionable past
who would do anything for me.

07:43.205 --> 07:45.539
And by "anything," I mean like...

07:45.590 --> 07:47.174
"Kill Marcia Worthman."

07:47.209 --> 07:48.509
Wow.

07:48.543 --> 07:50.344
Well, we're not gonna do that,

07:50.378 --> 07:51.545
but I like that you're thinking.

07:51.596 --> 07:54.420
- Can you put that in the front for me?
- Yeah.

07:55.684 --> 07:58.469
Hey. I'm gonna go watch the
hockey game at Clifford's.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.553
No. It's out there.

07:59.555 --> 08:01.388
I need you to handle this Kenny thing...

08:01.439 --> 08:02.856
The way you handle things.

08:02.891 --> 08:04.942
My dad's way of handling parenting stuff

08:04.976 --> 08:06.193
was to bring us to work.

08:06.228 --> 08:08.195
He wants us to be responsible drivers,

08:08.229 --> 08:10.230
He takes us to a crash site.

08:10.282 --> 08:13.067
See that hand? It's still texting.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.119
Hey, I got a bleeder!

08:15.153 --> 08:17.237
Who wants ice cream?

08:17.289 --> 08:19.707
Express it out of here!

08:19.741 --> 08:22.042
He doesn't want me to
have premarital sex?

08:22.077 --> 08:23.327
He takes me to Crystal.

08:23.378 --> 08:24.995
She was in the middle of telling me

08:25.046 --> 08:26.914
her sex-worker origin story,

08:26.916 --> 08:29.083
and I have to admit... I was zoning out,

08:29.085 --> 08:30.884
until I heard...

08:30.919 --> 08:33.053
Why do you want to have
sex with your girlfriend?

08:33.087 --> 08:34.722
I mean, honey, clearly, you're gay.

08:34.756 --> 08:35.972
What?

08:36.006 --> 08:37.841
Where... where... where
are you getting that? What?

08:37.892 --> 08:38.892
How's it going?

08:38.927 --> 08:40.010
Great. Super.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.763
Uh, thanks, Crystal. Good talk.

08:42.765 --> 08:43.765
Bye.

08:43.765 --> 08:44.898
So that happened.

08:44.933 --> 08:46.767
And then we went to bingo night,

08:46.769 --> 08:48.185
otherwise known as

08:48.236 --> 08:50.316
"the night where my mom
tries to make everyone forget

08:50.321 --> 08:52.573
about the sex I didn't have with Mimi."

08:52.607 --> 08:55.075
Okay. This is a big night.

08:55.109 --> 08:57.277
And not just for me, but
for our entire family.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.446
I know we've had an eventful 24 hours,

08:59.448 --> 09:01.114
but now we're over the hump.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.918
It's funny 'cause you said "hump."

09:04.953 --> 09:06.620
- No.
- No. Okay.

09:06.622 --> 09:08.422
All right, let's be our best selves.

09:08.456 --> 09:10.207
Pat, sell that canoe.
Jimmy, tuck in your shirt.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.959
Shannon, push those bingo cards.

09:11.961 --> 09:14.678
And you... Keep it in your pants.

09:15.763 --> 09:17.431
- Thank you.
- Hello, Shannon.

09:17.465 --> 09:18.598
Welcome.

09:18.633 --> 09:20.113
I will take four cards, please.

09:21.386 --> 09:23.887
But everyone's looking
to you to set the bar.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.639
You got to go high, Father Phil.

09:26.808 --> 09:28.809
Well, I took a vow of poverty.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.140
Does your Lexus know that?

09:33.948 --> 09:35.315
Well-played, child.

09:35.366 --> 09:36.816
Everything is beautiful.

09:36.818 --> 09:39.069
If god played bingo,
this is where he'd do it.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.871
I'd... like to think so.

09:40.905 --> 09:41.955
Good evening, Father. Ugh.

09:41.989 --> 09:44.291
It's Marcia Worthman and her big mouth.

09:44.325 --> 09:45.992
How's my fake smile?

09:45.994 --> 09:48.161
- Great. How's mine?
- Mm.

09:48.163 --> 09:49.663
- Tight.
- Mm.

09:49.665 --> 09:50.665
Eileen.

09:50.666 --> 09:52.999
Congrats on your little bingo night.

09:53.001 --> 09:54.885
It's amazing you were able to do this

09:54.919 --> 09:56.586
in light of the Kenny situation.

09:56.637 --> 09:58.388
Yeah. Well, thank you, Marcia.

09:58.422 --> 10:00.256
I do what I can for the church.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.308
Mimi started it!

10:01.342 --> 10:03.382
That skinny little tramp is all hands.

10:06.180 --> 10:07.514
What? There's an emergency?

10:07.565 --> 10:08.932
Oh!  I'll be right there. Okay.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.483
You know, it's hard, Eileen.

10:10.518 --> 10:12.102
Kids seem like they're
going on the right path,

10:12.153 --> 10:14.020
then they can just... Veer off.

10:14.071 --> 10:17.157
Well, my kids are all
on the right path, so...

10:17.191 --> 10:18.692
So...

10:18.694 --> 10:20.326
So...

10:24.699 --> 10:26.739
I'm not forcing you to break up,

10:26.750 --> 10:29.202
but, because I care about you,

10:29.253 --> 10:31.087
I want you to spend
the rest of the evening

10:31.122 --> 10:34.040
getting a glimpse of
what your future could be.

10:34.091 --> 10:37.043
By the way, they can smell fear.

10:37.094 --> 10:39.179
Good luck!

10:39.213 --> 10:41.431
Oh! Nothing better than mashed potatoes.

10:41.465 --> 10:43.600
Just pour that gravy like you mean it.

10:43.634 --> 10:46.052
Oh! Hello, corn on the cob.

10:46.103 --> 10:48.021
Ahh! Ah! Ah! Ah!

10:48.055 --> 10:49.772
Oh, beautiful.

10:58.065 --> 11:01.067
Honey, honey. Isn't this beautiful?

11:01.069 --> 11:03.403
We have to bid on this.

11:03.405 --> 11:05.154
Hey. Wow, look at this, huh?

11:05.205 --> 11:06.873
- Great canoe, huh?
- Yeah.

11:06.907 --> 11:09.375
You know what's crazy is, I
was gonna bid on it earlier,

11:09.410 --> 11:11.994
but then I heard that the
West Nile virus is back.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.379
- Can you believe that?
- Ohh.

11:13.414 --> 11:15.248
I don't know. It's just,
you put two and two together.

11:15.250 --> 11:17.800
The canoe's got to go
in the water, right?

11:17.835 --> 11:20.553
My question to you is,
how's your immunity?

11:25.726 --> 11:27.927
Are they bidding?

11:27.929 --> 11:29.512
Fingers crossed.

11:29.563 --> 11:31.314
Everything's going smoothly.

11:31.348 --> 11:32.354
The chicken's cooked all the

11:32.379 --> 11:33.456
- way through this year.
- Hey.

11:33.484 --> 11:34.901
And the gossip's quieting down.

11:34.935 --> 11:36.269
And the bishop will be here soon,

11:36.320 --> 11:38.571
so I can ask him about that
letter for Jimmy for Notre Dame,

11:38.605 --> 11:41.274
and I sent Kenny and Mimi
to work in the nursery.

11:41.276 --> 11:44.443
That'll scare them out of
having sex for another 20 years.

11:44.445 --> 11:46.946
I already scared them out
of having sex. Remember?

11:46.997 --> 11:48.581
You can never be too scared.

11:48.615 --> 11:50.616
Your mom's right. This
could be us one day.

11:50.667 --> 11:52.034
Wouldn't that be awesome?

11:52.085 --> 11:54.704
Uh...

11:54.755 --> 11:56.255
Uh, Mimi?

11:56.290 --> 11:58.925
Doesn't this all feel a little fast?

11:58.959 --> 12:01.594
I mean, I had a really interesting talk

12:01.628 --> 12:03.129
with a prostitute today

12:03.131 --> 12:05.297
who made me think maybe
we should, you know,

12:05.349 --> 12:07.466
slow things down a little bit.

12:07.517 --> 12:09.301
You're telling me this now?

12:09.303 --> 12:12.605
After we've had four kids and
have another one on the way?

12:12.639 --> 12:14.390
What are you talking about?

12:14.441 --> 12:15.808
If you wanted to slow things down,

12:15.810 --> 12:17.610
you should have said
something in high school.

12:17.644 --> 12:19.478
Now let's put on a movie for the kids.

12:19.529 --> 12:21.649
You know how horny I
get when I'm pregnant.

12:23.900 --> 12:27.403
Aaaaaaah!

12:27.454 --> 12:29.288
It's just poop.

12:29.322 --> 12:31.073
Yeah. Right.

12:32.075 --> 12:33.242
Holy crap.

12:33.293 --> 12:35.327
I don't want to have
four kids with Mimi.

12:35.329 --> 12:36.745
I have to come out.

12:36.796 --> 12:38.497
Yeah... now.

12:40.323 --> 12:41.967
But I think that was primarily

12:42.002 --> 12:43.302
'cause it smelled like socks and tacos.

12:43.336 --> 12:44.887
Dad? I need to talk to you.

12:47.340 --> 12:48.891
What? What's up?

12:48.925 --> 12:50.142
Uh...

12:50.176 --> 12:52.144
I have something pretty
important to tell you.

12:52.178 --> 12:54.013
I have tried to tell you this before.

12:54.064 --> 12:55.397
No, actually, that's not true.

12:55.432 --> 12:56.765
I've sort of started and
then I've changed the subject.

12:56.816 --> 12:58.150
But anyway, what I'm trying to say is...

12:58.184 --> 13:00.853
And please... Don't tell Mom yet.

13:02.906 --> 13:04.606
I don't want to have sex with Mimi...

13:04.657 --> 13:06.275
Or any other girl.

13:08.495 --> 13:09.862
Vaginas scare me.

13:11.498 --> 13:12.948
That feeling never goes away.

13:14.033 --> 13:15.417
Thank you for that.

13:15.452 --> 13:17.119
I'm not sure you
understand what I'm saying.

13:17.170 --> 13:18.537
No, I get it.

13:18.588 --> 13:21.006
I thought I handled it by
taking you to a prostitute,

13:21.040 --> 13:23.208
but that's not parenting.

13:23.210 --> 13:24.626
And it stops now.

13:24.677 --> 13:26.345
Eileen, what's your 20?

13:26.379 --> 13:27.379
What are you doing?

13:27.381 --> 13:28.680
We're having a family meeting.

13:28.715 --> 13:30.883
Who's ready to play bingo?

13:30.885 --> 13:32.485
Pat, can it wait?

13:32.519 --> 13:34.303
Bingo's about to start.
I'm handing out daubers.

13:34.354 --> 13:35.721
No.

13:35.772 --> 13:37.723
There's a major problem
with the brownie bar.

13:38.725 --> 13:40.359
I'm on my way.

13:40.393 --> 13:41.476
Knew that'd get her.

13:41.527 --> 13:43.395
There's no problem with the brownie bar.

13:43.397 --> 13:45.364
No, but there's a problem with us.

13:45.398 --> 13:46.732
We don't talk about things.

13:46.734 --> 13:48.984
Pat, there are 200 people out there.

13:49.035 --> 13:50.235
Now is not the time for this.

13:50.286 --> 13:52.037
It's never the time,
but now works for me,

13:52.071 --> 13:53.655
so we're going with it.

13:53.706 --> 13:55.073
Now, Kenny, this morning,

13:55.124 --> 13:57.376
you had a very healthy sexual appetite,

13:57.410 --> 13:59.711
and now you don't ever
want to sleep with a woman.

13:59.746 --> 14:01.329
Is that something you'd
like to talk about?

14:01.380 --> 14:02.414
Not a chance.

14:02.465 --> 14:03.582
Okay, but I'm coming back to you.

14:03.584 --> 14:04.883
No!

14:04.917 --> 14:07.302
Now, look, I understand
that this is uncomfortable

14:07.336 --> 14:09.921
because talking about real
stuff isn't something we do,

14:09.923 --> 14:11.973
but we're gonna start,
and I'll go first.

14:12.008 --> 14:13.391
Pat, we are not doing this...

14:13.426 --> 14:14.760
Your mother and I are in therapy.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.690
We've been going every
Tuesday night for a year.

14:16.729 --> 14:18.847
I-I thought you were playing tennis.

14:18.898 --> 14:21.066
Is this the body of a
man who plays tennis?

14:21.100 --> 14:24.603
I don't... really like
looking at your body.

14:24.605 --> 14:26.605
Thank you! That's honesty.

14:26.656 --> 14:29.074
All right. Come on.
Who's next? Somebody.

14:29.108 --> 14:30.241
I think we're done here.

14:30.276 --> 14:31.276
Why are you in therapy?

14:32.879 --> 14:34.996
Well, it's, uh, complicated.

14:35.031 --> 14:36.448
Pat! Stop talking.

14:36.450 --> 14:37.450
No!

14:37.451 --> 14:39.117
Can't you see we're screwing up our kids

14:39.168 --> 14:41.619
with our whole Irish-Catholic
not talking about things?

14:41.671 --> 14:44.255
We can't corned-beef this, Eileen.

14:44.290 --> 14:46.374
It's their lives, too.

14:47.760 --> 14:48.843
Fine.

14:48.878 --> 14:50.295
Fine!

14:50.346 --> 14:51.763
You want to know why we're in therapy?

14:51.797 --> 14:53.298
- No. -
Mnh-mnh.

14:53.349 --> 14:55.467
Because I made a mistake, okay?

14:55.469 --> 14:56.685
On our second date,

14:56.719 --> 14:58.636
your father and I went
to a Foreigner concert,

14:58.638 --> 15:01.306
I smoked a joint, and I ended
up getting pregnant with Jimmy.

15:01.308 --> 15:02.224
- What?!
- No way.

15:02.249 --> 15:03.468
Who's foreigner?

15:03.476 --> 15:05.610
And even though we didn't
know each other very well,

15:05.644 --> 15:09.063
we got married because we
wanted to do the right thing.

15:09.115 --> 15:12.317
And we made it work... For a while.

15:12.319 --> 15:15.370
But
it's not working anymore.

15:15.404 --> 15:17.764
And so now we're getting a divorce.

15:22.495 --> 15:23.995
There.

15:23.997 --> 15:24.997
I said it.

15:25.047 --> 15:27.415
Look, we're not perfect, okay?

15:27.466 --> 15:29.866
I don't want them to think
that they have to be, either.

15:31.003 --> 15:32.170
Oh, my god.

15:32.172 --> 15:34.505
This was it.

15:34.507 --> 15:36.507
This was my moment.

15:36.509 --> 15:37.759
- I...
- I'm anorexic!

15:37.810 --> 15:38.810
What?!

15:38.811 --> 15:40.178
Oh! Yeah. Y-yep.

15:40.229 --> 15:41.846
It started because of wrestling,

15:41.848 --> 15:44.682
but now I just like watching
the numbers on the scale drop.

15:44.684 --> 15:47.151
I mean, it is really hard

15:47.186 --> 15:49.937
not to shove those brownies
in my face right now.

15:49.988 --> 15:51.322
Okay, Jimmy, well, hey, listen,

15:51.356 --> 15:53.408
that's probably something we're
gonna need to discuss further,

15:53.442 --> 15:54.442
but thanks for sharing.

15:54.493 --> 15:56.277
I don't know if this is super-serious,

15:56.328 --> 15:58.529
but I haven't sent any
of that money to Ethiopia.

15:58.531 --> 16:00.698
I spent it all on a car
I bought off Craigslist.

16:00.749 --> 16:02.366
- What?!
- Also a surprise.

16:02.368 --> 16:04.619
I couldn't believe they
sold it to a 14-year-old.

16:04.670 --> 16:07.205
You can get anything you
want if you pay all in cash.

16:07.207 --> 16:08.506
What is happening here?!

16:08.540 --> 16:11.092
Uh... we're just...

16:11.126 --> 16:13.044
Being ourselves, Eileen.

16:13.095 --> 16:14.795
Okay. Great.

16:14.847 --> 16:17.932
So now we all know that
we're getting a divorce,

16:17.966 --> 16:20.446
Shannon's a thief, Jimmy doesn't eat.

16:21.386 --> 16:22.887
What about you, Kenny? Hmm?

16:22.938 --> 16:24.218
You in the mob now?

16:24.223 --> 16:26.623
You making meth in the
basement?

16:27.809 --> 16:29.060
I-I'm gay.

16:29.062 --> 16:30.444
What?

16:31.897 --> 16:33.981
I'm gay, Mom.

16:34.032 --> 16:36.200
What?

16:40.322 --> 16:41.872
I think Kenny said he's gay.

16:41.907 --> 16:43.074
Twice.

16:43.125 --> 16:44.992
And it also sounds like
you're getting a divorce.

16:45.043 --> 16:47.294
Unfortunately, the acoustics
in here are amazing.

16:50.182 --> 16:52.102
Do you want this open or closed?

16:53.251 --> 16:54.468
I'll close it.

17:03.564 --> 17:06.247
Sorry if I brought
this up at a bad time.

17:06.298 --> 17:08.782
No. I started it.

17:08.818 --> 17:11.252
Put these on. We're leaving.

17:11.253 --> 17:13.755
I don't think this is mine.

17:13.806 --> 17:15.890
Now you care about stealing?

17:20.095 --> 17:21.813
And there it was.

17:21.847 --> 17:23.731
After all my mom's hard work,

17:23.766 --> 17:26.651
we'd gone from the perfect
family in the church bulletin

17:26.685 --> 17:28.603
to the ones sneaking out the back,

17:28.605 --> 17:30.321
getting dirty looks from judgy nuns.

17:30.356 --> 17:31.439
Eileen!

17:31.490 --> 17:34.609
Oh, listen, tonight
wasn't a total debacle.

17:34.660 --> 17:39.280
In all the confusion over
your family's, um, situation,

17:39.282 --> 17:40.962
bidding closed early,
and I won your canoe.

17:41.917 --> 17:43.284
Take care of her for me.

17:43.286 --> 17:44.286
Oh, I will.

17:44.287 --> 17:45.847
I think I might use it as a planter,

17:45.871 --> 17:47.288
maybe grow some zucchini in there.

17:47.339 --> 17:49.340
Best $150 I've ever spent.

17:52.294 --> 17:55.296
There's no way that bleeping
is getting our canoe.

18:00.470 --> 18:02.937
Use your core! Use your core!

18:02.971 --> 18:03.971
They're coming for us!

18:03.973 --> 18:05.556
Shannon is doing nothing!

18:05.607 --> 18:06.724
I can't raise my arms!

18:06.775 --> 18:08.142
Where the hell is the  car?!

18:08.144 --> 18:09.977
Eileen! Eileen, stop!

18:10.028 --> 18:11.145
Keep going!

18:11.196 --> 18:12.897
Stop! Stop! Stop!

18:12.948 --> 18:14.508
Right now, right now. Stop. Put it down.

18:14.533 --> 18:16.484
Put it down. Put it down!

18:16.535 --> 18:18.069
What are you doing?

18:18.120 --> 18:20.788
I don't know! Obviously!

18:20.822 --> 18:22.490
I just stole a canoe from church,

18:22.492 --> 18:24.742
everyone in there knows
we're getting a divorce,

18:24.793 --> 18:27.128
and my own son just
told me he thinks he's...

18:27.162 --> 18:28.663
Gay?

18:28.714 --> 18:31.165
That's what he said.
We all heard him, right?

18:31.167 --> 18:32.383
Yes, thank you, Jimmy.

18:32.417 --> 18:33.801
I mean, I knew you'd flip out.

18:33.835 --> 18:35.136
Well, what did you expect?!

18:35.170 --> 18:37.672
You dropped a bomb. You all did!

18:37.723 --> 18:39.590
We're sending that car
to Africa, by the way.

18:39.675 --> 18:42.143
Good, because I couldn't
grind off the VIN number.

18:42.177 --> 18:43.777
The sooner it's off
my hands, the better.

18:43.812 --> 18:46.013
How could all this
happen without my knowing?

18:46.064 --> 18:47.598
Mom, you don't make it easy.

18:47.649 --> 18:51.152
Wait! Don't forget this!

18:51.186 --> 18:52.436
Guys, I know

18:52.487 --> 18:54.127
when your uncle Dwayne
and I got divorced,

18:54.156 --> 18:55.856
it seemed like the worst thing ever,

18:55.907 --> 18:57.908
but look at me now.

18:57.943 --> 18:58.943
I'm doing great.

18:58.994 --> 19:00.995
And you guys are gonna be great, too.

19:01.029 --> 19:02.909
You're gonna want to
call dibs on Christmas.

19:02.914 --> 19:03.948
I don't think I need...

19:03.999 --> 19:05.199
Eileen calls Christmas!

19:05.250 --> 19:08.202
But don't worry... everybody
still gets a fruitcake.

19:08.253 --> 19:09.453
Oh.

19:09.504 --> 19:10.704
Sorry, Kenny.

19:10.706 --> 19:11.872
Don't even worry about it.

19:11.923 --> 19:13.374
I got to go call the numbers.

19:13.425 --> 19:14.675
Mm.

19:14.709 --> 19:16.377
I'll call you tomorrow.

19:16.428 --> 19:18.045
Let's get this thing in the car.

19:18.096 --> 19:20.296
Wait! Eileen! Listen.

19:20.298 --> 19:22.549
Nobody wants this canoe
as much as I do, okay?

19:22.601 --> 19:25.185
But I am a cop, and this is stealing.

19:25.220 --> 19:27.721
Pat, too many things are changing.

19:27.772 --> 19:30.941
I need this canoe. Our
family needs this canoe.

19:30.976 --> 19:33.527
This canoe symbolizes
all our hopes and dreams,

19:33.561 --> 19:35.562
and it's going back in that garage!

19:41.870 --> 19:44.038
You heard your mother,
kids. Use your core.

19:44.072 --> 19:45.456
Let's go! Give me the keys!

19:46.958 --> 19:49.493
This is not a planter!

19:50.795 --> 19:52.963
Shannon, get the door!

19:52.997 --> 19:54.832
So, here we are.

19:54.883 --> 19:57.301
Just your typical all-American, Catholic,

19:57.335 --> 20:01.505
divorcing, disgraced,
lawbreaking, gay family.

20:01.556 --> 20:02.839
And I guess you could say

20:02.891 --> 20:05.559
we were all finally out
as who we really were.

20:08.097 --> 20:10.430
Hey! Roll down your window!

20:10.432 --> 20:12.099
Stop the car!

20:13.601 --> 20:15.102
Bishop Perez!

20:15.104 --> 20:18.021
Thank you for coming!
It's such an honor!

20:18.072 --> 20:19.356
This is my son Jimmy.

20:19.407 --> 20:21.108
I was hoping you could
write him a letter

20:21.110 --> 20:23.030
so he could get into Notre Dame.

20:23.077 --> 20:25.245
Um... sure.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.080
I have an eating disorder.

20:27.115 --> 20:28.782
Okay, okay. That's enough
sharing for tonight, buddy.

20:28.833 --> 20:30.283
I stole Marcia Worthman's purse.

20:30.335 --> 20:32.002
- All right.
- Drive, Pat. Drive fast.

20:35.673 --> 20:37.891
Who the hell was that?

20:37.925 --> 20:40.861
We're The O'Neals, damn it.
And we're a perfect mess.

20:43.588 --> 20:45.288
So you're gay, huh?

20:45.339 --> 20:46.790
Yeah.

20:46.792 --> 20:49.426
And you listen to Katy Perry
because you like her music,

20:49.460 --> 20:50.694
not because she's hot?

20:50.728 --> 20:51.728
Yeah.

20:52.446 --> 20:53.612
That's interesting.

20:53.613 --> 20:55.214
What is it you miss most about eating?

20:55.409 --> 20:56.848
Waffles.

20:57.294 --> 20:58.478
And the chewing.

20:58.700 --> 21:01.261
Actually, I have a question for you.

21:01.409 --> 21:02.383
You're a gay guy.

21:02.384 --> 21:04.686
So you're into style... And stuff.

21:04.687 --> 21:07.057
W... when you look
at me, is there any...

21:07.058 --> 21:08.842
- Your hair.
- Okay.

21:08.994 --> 21:09.791
You didn't let me finish.

21:09.792 --> 21:11.018
It's awful.

21:11.019 --> 21:12.168
You're a thief!

21:12.516 --> 21:13.966
A thief with good hair.

21:17.856 --> 21:19.152
I hate you guys.
