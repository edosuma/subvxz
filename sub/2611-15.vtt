WEBVTT

01:13.347 --> 01:15.016
Hey, mister.
Get over here.

01:17.518 --> 01:18.561
Hey!

01:20.772 --> 01:21.814
Come here!

01:31.032 --> 01:32.658
There's no witnesses.

01:32.658 --> 01:35.244
Nobody heard anything
over the trains running.

01:38.998 --> 01:41.459
Looks like a decade of skag
and skin popping.

01:41.459 --> 01:42.710
Yes, but it's not an O.D.

01:42.710 --> 01:44.879
There's no foam around
his mouth and nose.

01:44.879 --> 01:46.089
You see that?

01:46.089 --> 01:48.257
Take a look at that syringe.

01:48.257 --> 01:49.217
There's no blood in it.

01:49.217 --> 01:51.260
That's right, and that's 'cause
it's not a junkie syringe.

01:51.260 --> 01:53.513
Junkie syringe is one cc, tops.

01:53.513 --> 01:55.014
That's ten;
it's huge.

01:55.014 --> 01:56.724
Maybe the guy is a glutton.

01:56.724 --> 01:59.852
Maybe. Junkie or not ...

02:02.355 --> 02:04.440
somebody killed this man.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.688
1x15 Dead Woman Walking

03:02.322 --> 03:04.783
We got a Carl Aspen.
A long record.

03:04.783 --> 03:07.244
A few possession charges,
mostly assault and battery.

03:07.244 --> 03:09.913
Looks like he got
the battery this time.

03:09.913 --> 03:12.708
Lacerations on the face and lip.

03:12.708 --> 03:16.086
I saw a couple of torn nails
so I bagged his hands.

03:16.086 --> 03:18.589
May be able to get
some scrapings.

03:20.549 --> 03:22.759
Oh! Horatio.

03:24.845 --> 03:26.388
And what do we have there?

03:26.388 --> 03:27.347
It's damp.

03:27.347 --> 03:29.600
Maybe from the substance
inside the syringe.

03:29.600 --> 03:30.893
How much is there?

03:30.893 --> 03:32.186
$203.

03:32.186 --> 03:34.813
Well, that rules out
money as a motive.

03:34.813 --> 03:36.690
Alexx, do you have
a time of death?

03:36.690 --> 03:38.192
No corneal cloudiness.

03:38.192 --> 03:40.944
So, approximately an
hour to two hours ago.

03:40.944 --> 03:43.614
So, that makes it between
4:00 A.M. and 6:00 A.M.

03:43.614 --> 03:46.950
So, Carl here
was looking to score,

03:46.950 --> 03:50.078
needed money, but jumped
the wrong person, didn't he?

03:53.165 --> 03:54.166
Eric.

03:54.166 --> 03:55.501
What's up, H?

03:56.543 --> 03:58.045
That's a pencil, isn't it?

03:58.045 --> 03:59.087
Yes, it is.

04:05.344 --> 04:07.012
Looks like it's been
chewed up.

04:07.429 --> 04:08.889
It's got teeth marks.

04:08.889 --> 04:12.017
Okay, let's process it
for saliva and epithelials.

04:12.017 --> 04:13.060
You got it.

04:32.204 --> 04:33.789
Screen this for opiates.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.167
Hey.
Hey.

04:38.127 --> 04:39.920
I think I found the
cause of death.

04:40.254 --> 04:41.505
Before you open him?

04:41.505 --> 04:42.965
Cervical fracture.

04:44.007 --> 04:45.676
Looks like somebody
snapped his neck.

04:50.222 --> 04:51.723
Have you tested
under his nails for skin?

04:51.723 --> 04:53.434
Just about to.

04:56.562 --> 04:57.896
Wait a minute.

04:57.896 --> 05:00.065
His hand wasn't like
this on the scene.

05:00.065 --> 05:01.650
You think that's
parasite activity?

05:01.650 --> 05:02.943
Not like I've ever seen.

05:05.028 --> 05:07.030
That's got to be a chemical burn,
though, right?

05:07.030 --> 05:09.283
But that would have
presented immediately.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.160
Alexx?

05:12.202 --> 05:15.330
There's only one thing
I know that burns like that.

05:15.330 --> 05:16.999
Radiation.
We can't stay here.

05:16.999 --> 05:19.543
Got to notify the team;
they may have been exposed, too.

05:21.628 --> 05:23.881
We have an
emergency situation.

05:23.881 --> 05:25.757
Please find the
closest exit,

05:25.757 --> 05:28.552
and evacuate as quickly
and as safely as possible.

05:42.608 --> 05:44.693
I don't think this
is a fire drill.

05:54.244 --> 05:55.287
Yeah, I was just leaving.

05:55.287 --> 05:56.872
Checking up on me?

05:56.872 --> 05:58.373
Turn around.

05:59.416 --> 06:01.043
Why are you standing there?
What's wrong?

06:01.668 --> 06:05.464
Listen, Horatio and Alexx
found radioactivity on the victim.

06:05.756 --> 06:07.424
How bad?
Nobody knows yet.

06:07.424 --> 06:08.967
RMS are going to be
here any second.

06:08.967 --> 06:10.594
They're setting up a
hot zone outside.

06:10.594 --> 06:12.346
So, hurry up, all right?

06:14.431 --> 06:16.225
It's eating through his flesh.

06:17.267 --> 06:20.729
Odorless, tasteless and invisible.

06:20.729 --> 06:23.315
Too many neutrons
destabilize the atom.

06:23.315 --> 06:26.401
All those atoms ripping apart,
releasing energy.

06:30.197 --> 06:31.990
Makes you wonder
what it's done to us.

06:31.990 --> 06:34.451
Just hope it hasn't
rearranged our DNA.

06:35.494 --> 06:37.246
Here's Radiation
Management.

06:37.246 --> 06:38.539
Waiting for us?

06:38.539 --> 06:39.790
You better believe it.

06:42.918 --> 06:45.337
Definitely have an air
contaminant in here.

06:45.337 --> 06:47.422
We think the hand
is the source.

06:50.843 --> 06:52.052
Ooh, hot hand.

06:52.761 --> 06:54.346
Medium-level radiation.

07:00.018 --> 07:01.687
Let's make this sucker safe.

07:19.663 --> 07:21.248
What's in that coffeemaker?

07:21.248 --> 07:22.791
Cerrobend.

07:22.791 --> 07:24.877
A soft-melting alloy.

07:24.877 --> 07:27.421
Neutralizes the
radioactive particles.

07:28.255 --> 07:29.715
Kind of like freezing it.

07:32.426 --> 07:34.094
We should get you
two to scrubdown.

07:34.094 --> 07:35.387
Roger that.

07:35.387 --> 07:38.182
Okay, let's get the CDC to
quarantine the crime scene...

07:38.182 --> 07:40.309
till we know what
we've got. Right.

07:40.309 --> 07:42.060
You're both negative
for radioactivity.

07:42.060 --> 07:44.188
Okay. So, that means
we just need to contain ...

07:44.188 --> 07:45.981
the contaminated
evidence, right?

07:45.981 --> 07:47.399
And clean the dirty air.

07:47.399 --> 07:49.318
This will tell us if it's nuclear,

07:49.318 --> 07:51.403
medical, or right out
of the ground.

07:52.362 --> 07:53.697
Let me ask you a question.

07:53.697 --> 07:56.533
Could you administer radioactive
material by syringe?

07:56.533 --> 07:59.119
Radiation therapy
for cancer patients.

07:59.119 --> 07:59.912
Attacks tumors.

07:59.912 --> 08:03.999
Junkie mistook radioactive isotopes
for pharmaceutical narcotics.

08:03.999 --> 08:06.376
Possible. It's not like it
glows or anything.

08:06.376 --> 08:07.711
Syringes aren't marked.

08:07.711 --> 08:08.962
A junkie could mistake
it for anything.

08:12.174 --> 08:14.927
What's this?
Some grade-a smack?

08:15.969 --> 08:17.513
I just won the lotto.

08:21.517 --> 08:23.519
All right.
Let's go.

08:37.407 --> 08:39.784
Delko has definitely
been exposed.

08:39.784 --> 08:40.535
Yeah, but to what?

08:40.535 --> 08:42.871
I mean, there are hundreds
of types of radioactivity.

08:42.871 --> 08:45.207
Well, it basically
breaks down like this.

08:45.207 --> 08:46.708
Say you have a pencil, right?

08:46.708 --> 08:47.835
You put that on your skin,

08:47.835 --> 08:50.087
that's going to wash right
off 'cause it's an alpha particle.

08:50.087 --> 08:51.672
It's low-level radiation.

08:51.672 --> 08:53.882
You have a pen,
that's a beta particle.

08:53.882 --> 08:54.758
Has more energy.

08:54.758 --> 08:56.635
That will sink into something.

08:56.635 --> 08:58.971
And then you got gamma,
which is totally toxic.

08:58.971 --> 09:01.181
Goes right through you.
Burns you from the inside out.

09:01.181 --> 09:05.269
So, we don't know if it went on Delko,
in Delko or through Delko.

09:06.311 --> 09:07.729
Alpha, ...

09:07.729 --> 09:09.398
... beta ...

09:09.398 --> 09:10.399
... or gamma.

09:11.442 --> 09:14.987
Delko could have inhaled that
radioactivity off that money...

09:14.987 --> 09:16.447
and not even had a clue.

09:21.410 --> 09:24.288
So, maybe our vic
jumped somebody...

09:24.288 --> 09:26.373
who was delivering
radiopharmaceuticals.

09:26.373 --> 09:28.250
Any trained delivery guy...

09:28.250 --> 09:30.919
would have handed it over and notified
the nuclear regulatory commission.

09:30.919 --> 09:31.879
That would make sense,

09:31.879 --> 09:35.007
but I haven't heard anything from
the NRC about anything yet.

09:35.841 --> 09:38.677
So, you're looking for a thief
who steals radioactive isotopes.

09:39.094 --> 09:40.888
In syringe form.

09:42.139 --> 09:43.474
The guy is a thief.

09:43.474 --> 09:44.933
He's going to take
as many as he can.

09:46.560 --> 09:47.770
Radioactive materials.

09:47.770 --> 09:49.438
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

09:49.438 --> 09:50.481
You thinking terrorism?

09:51.523 --> 09:53.192
I think the doses
are too low.

09:54.109 --> 09:55.569
Come on, let me
show you the money.

10:08.957 --> 10:10.000
You ready?
Yup.

10:20.219 --> 10:22.930
Iodine 131 at the
end of its half-life.

10:23.222 --> 10:24.723
Low-level radiation.

10:24.723 --> 10:26.100
Okay.
Your guy should be okay.

10:26.100 --> 10:27.601
Good.

10:27.601 --> 10:29.228
I want to check
the pencil first ...

10:29.228 --> 10:31.522
and then I'll get it
back to you, all right?

10:32.731 --> 10:33.816
What's up?

10:35.567 --> 10:38.195
The guy said my exposure
was equal to what...

10:38.195 --> 10:40.030
a pilot gets on
a flight to Paris.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.573
Well, next time,
take the trip to Paris.

10:41.573 --> 10:43.117
It'll be easier on all of us.

10:43.117 --> 10:44.243
Tell me about it.

10:44.243 --> 10:47.329
I heard radioactivity can
cause temporary infertility.

10:47.329 --> 10:49.706
So, you and your girlfriend
are temporarily in luck.

10:49.706 --> 10:51.917
Yeah, or permanently
screwed.

10:51.917 --> 10:54.795
Hey, heard you were worried
about having children.

10:55.420 --> 10:56.880
This should keep you safe.

10:57.381 --> 10:59.466
The bell rings if you
get near radiation.

11:03.387 --> 11:04.430
That was nice.

11:35.961 --> 11:38.881
"B. King."

11:40.841 --> 11:41.884
Okay.

11:43.260 --> 11:46.430
It's Belle King.
Practicing attorney.

11:46.430 --> 11:49.141
Specializing in
environmental law.

11:49.141 --> 11:50.142
All righty.

11:54.313 --> 11:55.773
Who is it?

11:55.773 --> 11:57.858
It's the Miami Dade
police department.

12:01.737 --> 12:03.197
Let me see
your badges.

12:06.325 --> 12:07.367
Okay.

12:12.372 --> 12:15.042
Sorry about that, but, uh,
you can never be too careful.

12:16.502 --> 12:18.170
So, what can I do
for you, officers?

12:18.170 --> 12:19.004
Belle King?

12:19.004 --> 12:20.380
Yes, that is me.

12:20.380 --> 12:22.800
Ms. King, we have a warrant
to search your premises.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.968
Well, whatever it is you
are looking for my position...

12:24.968 --> 12:26.678
is it's covered by
attorney-client privilege,

12:26.678 --> 12:28.013
work product included.

12:28.013 --> 12:29.890
Well, we're not here
to talk about your clients.

12:29.890 --> 12:31.725
We're Crime Scene
Investigators.

12:34.645 --> 12:37.147
I'm placing a call to
the issuing judge.

12:38.398 --> 12:39.566
Thank you.

12:39.566 --> 12:42.361
Whoa.
What the hell is ... ?

12:43.403 --> 12:45.489
Is that me?
It can't be you.

13:00.379 --> 13:02.464
Ten times
the level at the lab.

13:49.769 --> 13:51.228
"One minute."

13:57.735 --> 13:58.778
What'd the doctor say?

13:58.778 --> 14:00.946
The doctor said that
we have a murder victim...

14:00.946 --> 14:02.323
who has less
than one week to live,

14:02.323 --> 14:04.241
but she is
not contagious.

14:04.241 --> 14:05.785
Okay, let's find Eric...

14:05.785 --> 14:07.286
and tell him to process the
cash from the crime scene.

14:07.286 --> 14:08.287
It's safe to touch now.

14:08.287 --> 14:10.122
Calleigh, let's go to
Belle's home.

14:10.122 --> 14:13.000
Iodine 131 decays
into normal iodine.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.043
That's what
you're looking for.

14:14.043 --> 14:16.212
Iodine reacts to sulfur.
I'll put some in my kit.

14:16.212 --> 14:17.963
Put some in mine, too.
Okay.

14:17.963 --> 14:19.965
Speed, let's go to
Belle's office and see....

14:19.965 --> 14:22.718
if any of her enemies
left her a warning.

14:22.718 --> 14:24.428
You got it.
Thank you.

14:39.235 --> 14:41.070
No silver jumpsuit, hmm?

14:41.821 --> 14:43.072
I guess that means I'm ...

14:43.072 --> 14:44.198
I'm all better.

14:45.032 --> 14:46.700
Well, um ...

14:46.700 --> 14:48.786
you've actually ingested
some isotopes.

14:48.786 --> 14:52.415
An isotope called
iodine 131.

14:52.415 --> 14:54.834
The stuff they use
for cancer therapy?

14:55.668 --> 14:57.962
But I haven't
ingested anything.

14:58.796 --> 15:02.383
And even if I did ingest
a little bit of iodine 131,

15:02.383 --> 15:03.426
it wouldn't kill you.

15:03.426 --> 15:05.845
Actually, you've ingested
quite a bit of it.

15:06.470 --> 15:07.471
Well, how much?

15:08.305 --> 15:11.100
It's my understanding that at
these concentration levels ...

15:11.100 --> 15:11.892
How much?

15:12.935 --> 15:16.063
Um ... roughly equivalent to...

15:16.063 --> 15:18.691
what four patients undergoing
radiation treatment ingest in,

15:18.691 --> 15:20.484
say, a six-month period.

15:36.876 --> 15:38.794
Somebody's making
a mistake.

15:40.588 --> 15:41.422
This ...

15:41.422 --> 15:42.465
this can't be true.

15:44.383 --> 15:47.803
I didn't eat or drink iodine 131.

15:47.803 --> 15:49.555
We think you
were poisoned.

15:51.640 --> 15:54.101
Now, the doctor is
coming in to ...

15:54.435 --> 15:55.728
How long?

15:59.565 --> 16:01.650
We think you have
about a week.

16:08.282 --> 16:09.241
I'm sorry.

16:09.867 --> 16:12.453
Not even enough time
for all my hair to fall out.

16:13.704 --> 16:14.747
I'm sorry.

16:17.875 --> 16:19.126
Is there somebody
I can call?

16:26.509 --> 16:28.969
Yes. My parents, my sister.

16:30.554 --> 16:31.555
Okay.

16:32.389 --> 16:33.516
I'll call them.
Never mind.

16:35.267 --> 16:37.645
Now, I'm going to need to ask
you some questions, too.

16:37.937 --> 16:39.897
Like who would
want to kill me?

16:40.648 --> 16:42.733
That would be a
good place to start.

16:47.113 --> 16:49.115
I'm going to need a list
of your clients and....

16:49.115 --> 16:52.159
any of the companies that
you filed suit against recently,

16:52.159 --> 16:54.078
and how about enemies.

16:54.078 --> 16:55.621
Well, that's a long list.

16:56.247 --> 16:57.832
Did you meet with any
of them yesterday?

16:57.832 --> 16:59.875
I met with
Twin Creeks Power Plant.

16:59.875 --> 17:02.545
Just sued for
plume contamination.

17:02.545 --> 17:03.587
They hate me.

17:04.255 --> 17:05.673
Did they bring you
anything to drink?

17:05.673 --> 17:08.134
No. But, uh,

17:08.134 --> 17:10.136
I had coffee at
my next meeting....

17:10.136 --> 17:13.888
with a nuclear weapons
facility, Elkwood.

17:13.888 --> 17:15.723
They bring you the coffee?

17:15.723 --> 17:17.727
No, actually I got it from
a vending machine,

17:17.727 --> 17:18.853
and if you keep
interrupting me,

17:18.853 --> 17:20.521
I'm never going to get
through my list of enemies.

17:20.521 --> 17:21.396
Go on.

17:21.396 --> 17:25.776
Right before lunch, I met with
Risher Pharmaceuticals.

17:26.193 --> 17:28.362
They're guilty of unsafe
toxic disposal,

17:28.362 --> 17:31.115
misplaced isotopes,
and - this is my favorite

17:31.115 --> 17:35.369
-- confusing isotopes so patients are
injected with the wrong dosages.

17:36.662 --> 17:37.955
No meals, no drinks.

17:37.955 --> 17:39.206
Not even a glass of water?

17:39.206 --> 17:41.751
I'd tell you.
Nothing.

17:43.085 --> 17:44.211
How are you feeling?

17:46.005 --> 17:47.256
Not very hungry.

17:50.176 --> 17:51.927
Yeah, we got threatening
phone calls,

17:51.927 --> 17:54.597
stupid letters --
mostly from other lawyers.

17:54.597 --> 17:56.265
Belle kicks ass.

17:56.891 --> 17:58.851
Yeah, I've seen
these articles.

18:00.644 --> 18:02.813
Does a lot of pro
bono work, huh?

18:02.813 --> 18:04.356
She's helped a lot of people.

18:05.733 --> 18:09.153
Who would do this?
Who is that sick?

18:18.037 --> 18:19.830
Can you tell me what's
in this drawer?

18:19.830 --> 18:21.624
Personal stuff.

18:21.624 --> 18:23.501
Well, do you mind
unlocking it?

18:29.924 --> 18:30.966
Thank you.

19:18.139 --> 19:19.140
Chickens?

19:19.140 --> 19:24.353
Yes. That's Mary Ann,
Linda and Jean.

19:24.854 --> 19:26.480
You supply the neighbors
with eggs?

19:26.897 --> 19:28.399
People pay me what they can.

19:30.192 --> 19:31.152
We okay?

19:31.152 --> 19:32.278
Air's clean.

19:32.278 --> 19:33.988
If there's any
iodine 131 left in there,

19:33.988 --> 19:37.491
it's lost all its potency.
Just let one of your CSIs in.

19:38.325 --> 19:39.368
Thank you, gentlemen.

19:39.368 --> 19:41.078
Okay.
Thank you.

19:42.413 --> 19:46.292
Would you mind
putting these on? Okay?

19:50.129 --> 19:50.963
Calleigh.

19:52.006 --> 19:54.633
I, uh, checked all the dishes
in the sink with sulfur.

19:54.633 --> 19:58.220
There was no reaction.
There's no sign of iodine so far.

19:58.220 --> 20:00.973
Okay.
You collect hourglasses.

20:02.016 --> 20:03.059
Yeah.

20:10.066 --> 20:13.527
My dad got me this one to remind
me not to work on the weekends.

20:19.575 --> 20:21.243
It lasts for five days.

20:26.707 --> 20:28.375
Somebody sent you flowers.

20:32.838 --> 20:33.756
From "a friend."

20:34.799 --> 20:38.010
Yeah, sometimes people like
to say thanks anonymously.

20:38.511 --> 20:40.346
I don't question
it if it's nice.

20:40.346 --> 20:42.473
Helps to balance out
all the hate mail.

20:42.473 --> 20:44.183
Speaking of, there's a ...

20:45.101 --> 20:48.646
there's a nice one from
Newhouse, Getty and Cooly.

20:48.646 --> 20:50.481
Who's Sam Carver?

20:50.481 --> 20:53.234
An angry father lashing out
at the world, not me.

20:53.234 --> 20:54.902
Where are my glasses?

20:56.487 --> 20:59.949
Good thing I didn't get that laser
surgery to correct my nearsightedness.

20:59.949 --> 21:01.659
"If you ever try
to contact us again,

21:01.659 --> 21:05.079
I will kill you ...
and that's a promise."

21:06.414 --> 21:10.793
Yeah, he wrote that right
after his oldest son died.

21:11.335 --> 21:12.586
It was horrible.

21:13.796 --> 21:15.714
I still wanted to fight for Hank.

21:15.714 --> 21:17.800
He's seven now,
and he's doing fine.

21:17.800 --> 21:20.428
We worked everything out.

21:20.428 --> 21:22.304
So you did contact him again.

21:22.304 --> 21:24.014
And we worked
everything out.

21:24.849 --> 21:27.727
In fact, Janet even leaves
me fresh orange juice...

21:27.727 --> 21:30.813
every couple of days to
celebrate the clean new water.

21:31.647 --> 21:33.274
Did she do that yesterday?

21:33.274 --> 21:34.358
Yeah.

21:34.358 --> 21:35.818
Did you drink it?

21:39.280 --> 21:40.322
Okay.

21:41.365 --> 21:43.868
Calleigh, could you come in
here a minute, please?

22:04.430 --> 22:05.890
It's positive for iodine.

22:14.355 --> 22:15.648
Recently,

22:15.648 --> 22:20.778
Belle won a class action suit for you
against the power plant for $200,000.

22:20.778 --> 22:24.115
So I guess I'm a little confused as
to why there are still hard feelings.

22:24.115 --> 22:25.283
But there aren't.

22:27.368 --> 22:28.995
Okay.

22:28.995 --> 22:31.539
"If you ever try
to contact us again,

22:31.539 --> 22:34.875
I will kill you,
and that's a promise."

22:35.710 --> 22:37.587
She dragged
her feet on the case.

22:38.212 --> 22:39.046
Holding out
for more money.

22:39.046 --> 22:42.466
She had a responsibility to
everyone in the lawsuit, Sam,

22:42.466 --> 22:45.011
not just us.
While our oldest son died.

22:46.721 --> 22:48.055
It's true.

22:48.055 --> 22:50.933
We could have used an
early settlement to move,

22:50.933 --> 22:52.768
for Michael's last days.

22:52.768 --> 22:54.645
But we're in a better
neighborhood now,

22:54.645 --> 22:57.565
and our other son Hank,
he's in a real good school.

22:58.107 --> 23:00.276
One with
wheelchair access.

23:00.818 --> 23:03.654
Okay, the problem,
Mrs. Carver,

23:03.654 --> 23:07.033
is that your husband is
still very angry with Belle.

23:07.575 --> 23:08.784
Aren't you, sir?

23:09.827 --> 23:12.371
$200,000.

23:13.831 --> 23:17.043
Does that seem like enough
money for a child's life to you?

23:19.045 --> 23:20.087
Of course not.

23:24.175 --> 23:26.260
I'm sorry for your loss.

23:29.430 --> 23:32.308
I see no holes or striations.

23:33.851 --> 23:36.062
But there is something
else we can try.

23:36.812 --> 23:40.399
We take the empty orange
juice container and turn ...

23:42.485 --> 23:45.279
to good old ...

23:45.279 --> 23:46.405
H2-0.

23:51.410 --> 23:52.370
There you go.

23:52.787 --> 23:56.540
So someone has injected
this with a syringe, haven't they?

23:58.709 --> 24:00.711
Sam Carver shoots a
needle through plastic.

24:00.711 --> 24:02.964
Why not just pour isotopes
directly into the juice?

24:02.964 --> 24:04.799
Because I don't think
it was Sam Carver.

24:04.799 --> 24:06.717
I think someone
else injected it.

24:07.051 --> 24:08.135
The Carvers are innocent.

24:08.135 --> 24:09.512
The Carvers are innocent, and...

24:09.512 --> 24:13.683
we are looking for somebody who
knows their way around a syringe.

24:23.484 --> 24:24.902
Eric, you get anything?

24:24.902 --> 24:26.571
Seventeen prints so far.

24:26.571 --> 24:28.864
No matches on AFIS.
But I did get this.

24:30.533 --> 24:31.409
What is that?

24:31.409 --> 24:32.451
Numbers I hope.

24:32.451 --> 24:35.246
I don't know, like from a
credit card or a bank card.

24:35.246 --> 24:37.456
Could have come straight
out of the killer's wallet.

24:37.456 --> 24:39.750
Could lead us straight
back to him hopefully, huh?

24:39.750 --> 24:40.793
Yeah.

24:42.837 --> 24:45.131
Looks like sixteen numbers.

24:45.131 --> 24:47.091
Eric, your genius knows no bounds.

24:47.091 --> 24:49.594
There you have it.
Nice going.

24:49.594 --> 24:52.555
I'll call the credit card company,
see whose cash this is.

24:53.389 --> 24:54.765
George Risher?

24:55.308 --> 24:57.351
CEO of Risher
Pharmaceuticals.

24:57.351 --> 24:58.144
Yeah, I know who he is.

24:58.144 --> 25:01.814
I have a class action suit against
him for contaminating groundwater.

25:01.814 --> 25:03.024
1,000 homeowners.

25:03.024 --> 25:05.318
I'm asking $128 million.

25:08.112 --> 25:10.031
Hey.
Are you okay?

25:10.323 --> 25:12.825
You know what,
come here.

25:17.580 --> 25:19.373
You need to get
some rest now.

25:19.373 --> 25:21.250
You need to spend sometime
with friends or family,

25:21.250 --> 25:23.002
and let me handle this, okay?

25:25.087 --> 25:28.257
Did you know Horatio
was the first CSI?

25:28.257 --> 25:30.134
He was...
the what?

25:30.760 --> 25:31.969
In Hamlet.

25:32.470 --> 25:35.556
When Hamlet was
poisoned and dying,

25:35.556 --> 25:38.059
he asked his
best friend Horatio...

25:38.059 --> 25:40.478
to tell the world
who murdered him.

25:44.607 --> 25:46.692
Okay, I'll tell the world.

25:48.444 --> 25:50.696
But first, I'm going
to go talk to Risher,

25:50.696 --> 25:53.532
and I'll call you later.

26:00.122 --> 26:03.167
Miami Dade police.
We'd like to see George Risher.

26:03.167 --> 26:04.627
May I ask what this is about?

26:04.627 --> 26:07.046
Tell Mr. Risher it's
about Belle King.

26:07.046 --> 26:08.547
You know, if that woman
comes by here again,

26:08.547 --> 26:09.966
I will have to call security.

26:09.966 --> 26:11.634
Now, why would
you do that?

26:11.634 --> 26:13.511
She's, um ...
a nut case.

26:13.511 --> 26:15.596
She's been driving
my boss crazy.

26:17.682 --> 26:19.225
I'll go get Mr. Risher.

26:19.225 --> 26:20.685
You do that.

26:23.813 --> 26:26.232
Three blocks from where
Carl Aspen was murdered.

26:26.232 --> 26:29.902
Yeah, three blocks from
where iodine 131 first showed up.

26:29.902 --> 26:32.113
And twenty feet ...

26:34.198 --> 26:39.412
Twenty feet from where it's
being distributed as we speak.

26:42.665 --> 26:43.916
This is a new lock.

26:44.625 --> 26:45.626
How can you tell?

26:47.712 --> 26:50.047
See in here?
This is freezer burn.

26:50.047 --> 26:55.052
You would spray freon in
to disrupt the lock internally.

27:02.435 --> 27:05.605
Maybe Risher's in so much hot
water already he didn't report it.

27:05.605 --> 27:08.190
Maybe he staged
a break-in to cover it.

27:09.859 --> 27:11.819
George Risher.
What's this about?

27:12.236 --> 27:15.031
This is about your involvement
in a murder, Mr. Risher.

27:16.282 --> 27:18.034
Is there somewhere
we can talk?

27:19.493 --> 27:21.370
My office.
Thank you.

27:31.380 --> 27:33.090
Lock here is busted, too.

27:34.383 --> 27:35.176
Makes sense.

27:35.176 --> 27:37.428
It's where they keep all
the radioactive material.

27:37.428 --> 27:40.139
Yeah, in the fridge
with their soft drinks.

27:43.476 --> 27:44.518
Oh, god.

27:46.312 --> 27:48.397
Can you imagine
drinking in our lab?

27:48.940 --> 27:52.151
Well, it is a wonderful way
to ingest all sorts of chemicals...

27:52.151 --> 27:53.945
and biologicals.

27:54.403 --> 27:55.988
Can you hand me the scale?

27:55.988 --> 27:58.366
Yeah.
Anything recognizable?

27:58.866 --> 28:00.910
An earring,
a frito and this.

28:01.327 --> 28:05.206
Looks like dirt from a heavy
tread shoe or boot.

28:06.624 --> 28:08.709
So, let me get this straight,
Mr. Risher,

28:08.709 --> 28:09.961
you did have a break-in,

28:09.961 --> 28:12.129
but you failed to report
it to the police?

28:12.129 --> 28:14.298
We needed time
to do an inventory.

28:14.298 --> 28:15.716
Figure out what,
if anything was missing.

28:15.716 --> 28:18.344
And something was missing,
wasn't it?

28:18.344 --> 28:21.722
Like four or five syringes
with iodine 131.

28:22.265 --> 28:23.266
How did you know that?

28:23.266 --> 28:27.436
We found a $20 bill on a dead mugger
with your credit card impression on it.

28:28.479 --> 28:29.939
This conversation is over.

28:29.939 --> 28:34.569
No, it's not.
Not yet. You ...

28:34.569 --> 28:37.280
stand to lose $128 million

28:37.280 --> 28:39.699
if Ms. King wins her
suit against you, right?

28:39.699 --> 28:41.200
I'll have security
show you out.

28:41.200 --> 28:43.869
It would be convenient
if she disappeared.

28:43.869 --> 28:45.830
Ms. King is playing
David and Goliath.

28:45.830 --> 28:49.125
She hasn't a single piece of
solid evidence against us.

28:49.125 --> 28:52.628
As for this dead person with
my money and my medicine,

28:52.628 --> 28:55.715
thank you very much
for solving our break-in.

28:56.257 --> 28:58.467
If I find out that you did this,

28:58.467 --> 29:00.761
I'm going to make it
my mission to get you.

29:49.894 --> 29:50.937
Progress?

29:51.354 --> 29:52.396
Yeah.

29:52.730 --> 29:55.316
The mystery goo we found on
the floor of Risher's lab...

29:55.316 --> 29:56.734
is made up of nitrogen,
phosphoric acid,

29:56.734 --> 29:58.861
potassium and methyl sulfide.
So, in other words ...

29:58.861 --> 29:59.820
Chicken dung.

29:59.820 --> 30:02.281
Okay, so Risher cuts
through Belle's backyard,

30:02.281 --> 30:03.908
doses her O.J.

30:03.908 --> 30:06.202
and then tracks chicken
remnants back to his lab.

30:06.202 --> 30:07.870
Delko ...
It's not that big a deal.

30:07.870 --> 30:09.497
If you would have
thought about it,

30:09.497 --> 30:10.331
you would have come up
with same conclusion.

30:10.331 --> 30:11.958
It's your nose.

30:14.377 --> 30:16.045
You think this could be
from the iodine exposure?

30:16.045 --> 30:17.964
That's probably
stress-related.

30:17.964 --> 30:20.424
Beta contamination does
not cause nosebleeds.

30:20.424 --> 30:21.342
That's easy for you to say.

30:21.342 --> 30:22.677
You didn't breathe in
radioactive money.

30:22.677 --> 30:24.470
You spent a lot of time
in those canals...

30:24.470 --> 30:25.930
swimming through
radioactive crap.

30:25.930 --> 30:28.683
So I wouldn't be too concerned
about a little nosebleed.

30:28.683 --> 30:31.310
Yeah, and the RM guys gave
you a clean bill of health,

30:31.310 --> 30:34.313
and you do get nosebleeds
in high-pressure situations.

30:34.313 --> 30:35.898
Speedle, did you want
to tell us something?

30:35.898 --> 30:37.149
I want to show you
something.

30:41.487 --> 30:44.407
Now, I got these pictures
from Belle's home office.

30:44.407 --> 30:45.866
That's Risher's place.

30:45.866 --> 30:47.785
And Risher's lab documents.

30:47.785 --> 30:49.453
These are night vision.

30:49.453 --> 30:51.914
Yeah, and my guess it's
probably after hours.

30:51.914 --> 30:53.541
Belle shouldn't
have these pictures.

30:53.541 --> 30:56.002
Well, she sure couldn't have
taken them without permission.

30:56.002 --> 30:58.421
It means the chicken dung
in Risher's office ...

30:58.421 --> 30:59.880
could have
come from Belle.

31:00.256 --> 31:01.841
So, if she breaks in,

31:01.841 --> 31:06.012
takes these pictures and
steals radioactive iodine.

31:06.012 --> 31:07.930
Okay, I understand
the documents,

31:07.930 --> 31:10.433
but why take the iodine?

31:10.433 --> 31:12.018
To analyze it ...

31:12.018 --> 31:15.396
to prove that Risher
has shabby security.

31:15.396 --> 31:16.814
To kill herself.

31:16.814 --> 31:18.691
I mean, maybe she's
a martyr for her cause.

31:18.691 --> 31:21.319
She wouldn't be the first.
Lady does like the press.

31:21.319 --> 31:22.904
I don't agree.

31:23.946 --> 31:26.991
But these pictures could
put Belle inside Risher's lab.

31:26.991 --> 31:28.409
And according
to some chickens,

31:28.409 --> 31:31.787
right in front of the refrigerator
with missing iodine.

31:32.204 --> 31:35.416
H, all of the evidence points to the fact
that Belle took these pictures.

31:35.416 --> 31:37.793
I understand,
but something's not right.

31:39.670 --> 31:41.047
We're missing something.

31:58.238 --> 31:59.155
What are you doing?

31:59.155 --> 32:01.032
I'm going to take these
into evidence.

32:02.492 --> 32:04.160
Come on, Horatio.

32:04.160 --> 32:07.872
I can't win my cases with
illegally obtained documentation.

32:07.872 --> 32:10.875
Breaking into that bastard's
lab would be against the law.

32:11.709 --> 32:13.753
And besides,
I'm not that brave.

32:15.838 --> 32:20.009
We found some film in your office
with pictures of the Risher lab on it.

32:21.219 --> 32:22.720
And?

32:22.720 --> 32:24.097
You want to tell me about it?

32:26.599 --> 32:29.352
Do you have sources
on the street?

32:30.395 --> 32:31.771
Well, then, you know.

32:31.771 --> 32:33.481
I can't give up this person.

32:34.232 --> 32:36.109
They're helping me
get the bad guys.

32:38.194 --> 32:39.237
Okay.

32:43.449 --> 32:44.492
How are you feeling?

32:47.287 --> 32:48.329
Never better.

32:50.206 --> 32:52.250
But you might
want to hurry.

32:55.378 --> 32:56.421
I will.

33:09.559 --> 33:11.436
I looked for reflections --

33:11.436 --> 33:14.314
a hand or fingertip captured
holding the document.

33:14.314 --> 33:17.567
Anything to tell us who took
these pictures other than Belle.

33:18.610 --> 33:19.986
How'd the shoe
treads turn out?

33:19.986 --> 33:22.488
It didn't.
No match.

33:22.488 --> 33:23.573
Really?

33:24.616 --> 33:26.201
Guess we were wrong.

33:28.286 --> 33:29.370
Hang on a second.

33:30.121 --> 33:31.623
Is that the door to the lab?

33:32.665 --> 33:34.125
Go tight on that.

33:38.171 --> 33:39.589
That's a levered dead bolt.

33:40.632 --> 33:42.383
There's no evidence of freon.

33:43.092 --> 33:44.177
You got the picture?

33:45.929 --> 33:47.472
So that's the old lock ...

33:47.972 --> 33:49.933
And that's a new lock, isn't it?

33:49.933 --> 33:53.353
So if she took the pictures she
didn't break in to do it, did she?

33:53.353 --> 33:54.521
Somebody let her in.

33:55.355 --> 33:56.731
Somebody let her in.

33:57.690 --> 34:00.151
Which means she's
protecting an insider.

34:00.151 --> 34:02.904
You know, when I found the film it
was in a heart-shaped chocolate box.

34:02.904 --> 34:04.280
Maybe that's how
they communicated.

34:04.280 --> 34:06.533
You also found a camera
in her office, right?

34:06.533 --> 34:08.701
So if the insider was the
one who sent her the film ...

34:08.701 --> 34:11.411
Maybe the insider
took the pictures.

34:11.411 --> 34:12.496
Where's the camera?

34:12.496 --> 34:13.956
It's on its way to the
fingerprint lab.

34:13.956 --> 34:14.998
Call them.

34:25.092 --> 34:26.636
You misled me, Belle.

34:27.887 --> 34:28.929
Didn't you?

34:31.224 --> 34:32.266
You ...

34:33.768 --> 34:34.811
have a source ...

34:37.021 --> 34:38.063
inside Risher.

34:39.732 --> 34:41.317
And I want to know
who it is.

34:45.780 --> 34:47.239
He has nothing
to do with this.

34:47.239 --> 34:48.449
No?

34:48.449 --> 34:49.701
He took the pictures,

34:49.701 --> 34:51.327
he knows where they
store the iodine,

34:51.327 --> 34:53.580
he's involved and
I want his name.

34:56.291 --> 34:57.625
He'd never hurt me.

34:57.625 --> 34:59.711
Belle, either you
give me his name,

34:59.711 --> 35:00.920
or I'm going
to get it myself.

35:00.920 --> 35:02.380
If you expose my source,

35:04.132 --> 35:06.968
my evidence
will be inadmissible...

35:06.968 --> 35:09.679
and it'll ruin my
case against Risher.

35:11.306 --> 35:12.765
I think he poisoned you.

35:18.646 --> 35:20.064
I'm one victim.

35:21.524 --> 35:24.110
Do you know how many other
people will be killed by Risher?

35:25.695 --> 35:28.823
Right now,
my concern is you.

35:42.921 --> 35:45.381
There's not a single
fingerprint on this.

35:45.798 --> 35:47.217
It's probably wiped down.

35:47.634 --> 35:50.178
Lenses are such a good
place for fingerprints.

35:52.680 --> 35:54.557
Why is this blurry?

35:56.851 --> 35:57.936
Wait a minute.

35:58.561 --> 36:00.355
This has a diopter on it.

36:00.980 --> 36:03.942
Diopters refer to the
curvature of the lens.

36:04.359 --> 36:05.610
Increase the diopter, ...

36:05.610 --> 36:08.029
... the lens gets thicker,
the curvature greater,

36:08.029 --> 36:08.905
redirecting the light,

36:08.905 --> 36:12.659
making the image appear
larger and in focus.

36:12.659 --> 36:16.120
Just like putting on a pair of
glasses and this one ...

36:16.538 --> 36:18.498
is set for farsightedness.

36:18.998 --> 36:20.291
So what?

36:20.291 --> 36:22.669
Belle is nearsighted.

36:24.212 --> 36:26.923
I need the Risher employee list
complete with medical records.

36:26.923 --> 36:28.800
I'll narrow it down to
farsighted employees.

36:28.800 --> 36:30.218
Okay, I'll call a judge
and get a warrant.

36:30.218 --> 36:31.719
Eric, start taking swabs.

36:31.719 --> 36:33.805
To match with what?
We didn't get any DNA off the pencil.

36:33.805 --> 36:36.182
Oh, I think I know
where else to look.

36:36.724 --> 36:39.602
The isotopes have
become harmless.

36:39.602 --> 36:44.607
Still, you do realize
this is a long shot.

36:44.899 --> 36:46.192
I know, Alexx.

36:46.192 --> 36:49.737
I have no idea if the lead is
compromising the epithelials.

36:50.154 --> 36:51.364
All I need is one.

36:52.282 --> 36:54.993
Like I said,
long shot.

36:57.412 --> 36:59.497
Must have been
quite a fight.

37:04.127 --> 37:07.338
'cause it looks like I have
a pretty nice hunk in there.

37:11.134 --> 37:12.468
So we have a killer.

37:13.094 --> 37:14.220
Horatio?

37:14.220 --> 37:16.598
Fourteen employees
at Risher are farsighted.

37:16.598 --> 37:19.726
Only one with this DNA,
though.

37:30.278 --> 37:31.905
Got it.
I got the match.

37:34.616 --> 37:35.950
I'm sorry this is
the employee ...

37:35.950 --> 37:38.578
Miami Dade Police.
Get out of the way, ma'am.

37:40.455 --> 37:41.456
Hey!
Hey!

37:45.376 --> 37:47.086
That's private property!

37:47.086 --> 37:48.838
You have the right
to remain silent.

37:49.130 --> 37:52.800
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

38:07.357 --> 38:11.569
We found your skin underneath
the victim's fingernails.

38:11.569 --> 38:14.864
These are called alleles.
There's a 100% match to you.

38:14.864 --> 38:15.990
I work in medicine.

38:15.990 --> 38:17.534
I know about DNA.

38:17.534 --> 38:18.785
Do you?
Yeah.

38:19.744 --> 38:22.580
It's an exciting field, isn't it?
Yeah.

38:22.914 --> 38:24.958
But that's not what we're
here to talk about, Parker.

38:24.958 --> 38:28.461
We're here to talk about the
fact that you got mugged...

38:28.461 --> 38:31.047
the night you were
planning your own murder.

38:33.466 --> 38:35.009
Don't hurt me!
I got money, I got money.

38:35.009 --> 38:36.719
I got money.
Here.

38:38.054 --> 38:39.305
That's nothing,
that's nothing.

38:41.391 --> 38:42.225
What's this?

38:42.225 --> 38:43.560
Some grade-a smack?

38:44.602 --> 38:46.396
I gave him my money.

38:46.729 --> 38:50.275
Money that you used from
the Risher coffee run, right?

38:50.275 --> 38:51.651
He wouldn't back off.

38:53.278 --> 38:54.070
Self-defense.

38:54.070 --> 38:56.155
Oh, yeah, self-defense.

38:56.573 --> 39:01.327
You were trying to defend the
other four syringes of iodine 131.

39:01.327 --> 39:04.038
Snapped his neck,
left the cash...

39:04.038 --> 39:06.249
and took your syringes
over to Belle's.

39:15.091 --> 39:17.677
Now, Parker,
I have a question for you.

39:19.762 --> 39:21.431
Do you have
a crush on Belle?

39:22.473 --> 39:26.227
Because, see, once we do
a full handwriting analysis,

39:26.227 --> 39:28.688
I'm certain we're
going to get a match...

39:28.688 --> 39:31.608
between your
office stationary...

39:31.608 --> 39:34.736
and the anonymous
flower card.

39:42.785 --> 39:43.912
She, uh ...

39:44.787 --> 39:45.830
tricked me ...

39:46.414 --> 39:47.874
into doing things for her.

39:51.628 --> 39:52.712
Thanks.

39:55.089 --> 39:57.467
Things like breaking into
Risher to gather evidence.

39:57.467 --> 39:58.509
That kind of thing?

40:09.729 --> 40:13.566
She pretended to like me
to get what she wanted.

40:20.573 --> 40:23.409
I told her how I felt about
her and she just ...

40:23.409 --> 40:24.661
she just cares
about sick people.

40:36.839 --> 40:38.383
Just cared about
sick people.

40:40.134 --> 40:42.971
So you spiked her orange
juice to get her attention.

40:47.851 --> 40:48.893
I loved her.

40:50.645 --> 40:52.313
Enough to love
her to death?

41:07.161 --> 41:08.705
I thought if she were dead ...

41:10.456 --> 41:12.125
I could forget about her.

41:14.085 --> 41:15.545
Well, that is a plan.

41:16.588 --> 41:18.548
But it didn't turn out
that way, did it?

41:20.633 --> 41:25.847
You'll have the next fifty years
in a 6x6 cell to work on it.

41:44.532 --> 41:45.575
Belle.

41:54.751 --> 41:56.002
You were right.

42:00.882 --> 42:02.133
About what?

42:04.219 --> 42:09.432
Your pictures of Risher
confirm that he's dirty.

42:12.393 --> 42:14.646
So he was
dumping waste.

42:16.397 --> 42:18.775
My evidence was
obtained with a warrant.

42:20.109 --> 42:23.238
Now I can prove it in court.
How about that?

42:25.907 --> 42:26.950
Horatio?

42:32.705 --> 42:33.915
Tell the world.

42:36.292 --> 42:37.418
I will.

42:40.838 --> 42:42.006
Horatio?

42:48.221 --> 42:49.389
Thank you.

42:57.397 --> 42:58.439
Thank you.
