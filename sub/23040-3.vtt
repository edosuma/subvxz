WEBVTT

00:08.600 --> 00:11.080
They say you never forget your first love.

00:11.160 --> 00:14.240
With your first love, you have no past.
There's no one else.

00:14.320 --> 00:15.680
Just the two of you.

00:15.760 --> 00:18.400
-Elisa says--
-Elisa is lying. Trust me.

00:20.280 --> 00:22.960
She’s furious because I asked her
for an annulment.

00:24.240 --> 00:26.440
Why did you do it? Why did you ask her?

00:26.520 --> 00:28.040
Because I don't love her.

00:33.440 --> 00:37.880
But the important thing for me to know
is where you stand in all this.

00:41.040 --> 00:43.200
Francisco, it's not that easy.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.200
Then it's not Elisa
who's keeping us apart.

00:49.360 --> 00:50.960
You still love Carlos, don't you?

00:52.440 --> 00:53.880
You can't forget him.

00:55.160 --> 00:59.080
But time sometimes corrupts
that pure love,

00:59.160 --> 01:01.040
and makes it show its worst side...

01:02.000 --> 01:03.160
jealousy.

01:08.360 --> 01:12.040
Well, what a surprise to see you here,

01:12.120 --> 01:14.680
though traitors of a feather
flock together.

01:14.760 --> 01:17.000
Francisco is here to help me
with my project.

01:17.080 --> 01:18.720
I'm back for good, Carlos.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.920
I'm working with her
to win this challenge.

01:23.320 --> 01:26.040
You want to ally yourself with him?
Perfect.

01:26.800 --> 01:29.400
But I warn you,
he's capable of betrayal to get ahead.

01:29.480 --> 01:32.360
He can also forgive.
Something others can't do.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.040
I was wrong about you, Carlos, not him.

01:36.640 --> 01:38.320
In that case, go right ahead.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.920
I remind you, I was the one who left you.

01:44.440 --> 01:46.000
We'll see who claims victory.

01:49.800 --> 01:52.880
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

03:09.000 --> 03:10.160
Francisco just kissed me.

03:12.440 --> 03:13.280
What?

03:14.160 --> 03:16.880
It's what I needed
to know if I still love him.

03:17.840 --> 03:20.080
-Then why the long face?
-Carlos.

03:21.840 --> 03:24.280
I love Carlos, not Francisco.

03:28.840 --> 03:32.000
He made me feel like
I could be someone else...

03:32.080 --> 03:33.080
CHAPTER 11: JEALOUSY

03:33.160 --> 03:35.200
...like I could've found my place.

03:35.760 --> 03:37.640
I don't belong anywhere.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.200
The same thing happened to me with Pablo.

03:44.160 --> 03:47.560
He was my hearth, my home.

03:48.640 --> 03:49.880
"Was"?

03:49.960 --> 03:53.280
Lidia, since the other night,
everything's horrible between us.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.120
I keep on lying to him and...

03:58.680 --> 04:00.520
he's lost his faith in me.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.880
-But has he found out anything?
-No.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.840
-Did you tell him anything?
-No.

04:05.720 --> 04:07.800
But all this will destroy
our relationship.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.440
I'm handing him
to that two-faced Marisol on a platter.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.000
-I feel like an idiot.
-I envy you, you know?

04:16.640 --> 04:17.880
You have no doubts.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.240
You know he's your man, and that's it.

04:24.400 --> 04:27.640
So don't ruin it
just because you're jealous.

04:28.360 --> 04:32.240
Tell him you love him,
and if you have to, apologize to him.

04:33.160 --> 04:36.120
He is your home, right?

04:37.360 --> 04:38.480
Yes, he really is.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.960
You're right. I love him.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.200
I love him so much.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.320
Where are you going?

04:50.400 --> 04:52.840
To tell him
I'm tired of acting like an idiot.

04:52.920 --> 04:56.080
Drink all of that.
It'll do you good. Lidia...

04:58.360 --> 04:59.880
I'll replace them tomorrow.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.240
Go on and go.

05:07.920 --> 05:10.280
I'm sure she's thinking about you, too.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.160
No. I wasn't thinking about Marga.

05:12.960 --> 05:13.800
Pablo...

05:14.480 --> 05:16.440
All right, yes, yes.

05:16.520 --> 05:19.000
I just don't know.

05:19.080 --> 05:22.320
She's acting like someone else.

05:22.400 --> 05:27.560
Since New Year's Eve,
I get the feeling she's lying to me.

05:27.640 --> 05:31.480
She's making up silly excuses.
Now I'm not sure.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.720
How can I marry someone
I can't trust?

05:33.800 --> 05:35.480
You asked her to marry you?

05:41.240 --> 05:44.360
I haven't asked her yet because...

05:45.240 --> 05:47.840
I haven't found the right moment,
but yes.

05:48.520 --> 05:53.440
That's not the case, Marisol.
I don't know who Marga is.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.960
Is she the same woman I once knew?

05:56.040 --> 05:59.280
Then I'd say don't be hasty.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.280
Think it over,
at least until you're very sure.

06:03.360 --> 06:04.800
Thanks for the advice.

06:06.880 --> 06:08.120
It's free.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.840
Not free, no.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.480
This deserves some coffee.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.320
-Two sugars?
-Yes.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.240
We were engaged for ten years,
and nothing.

06:38.720 --> 06:42.000
A few months with this tart,
and she gets this rock.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.240
You have to talk to your sister.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.360
If we want to win
and get the company back,

06:48.440 --> 06:50.200
she can't go near Lidia again.

06:51.240 --> 06:53.000
Luckily, tonight's performance worked.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.320
-You're still in love with her.
-What?

06:57.040 --> 06:57.880
With Alba.

06:58.760 --> 06:59.960
No.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.520
But I don't think you can say the same.

07:08.040 --> 07:11.680
I don't want us being seen together.
Elisa has complicated things enough.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.360
Relax. I'll talk to her.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.840
She's not worth suffering over, Carlos.

07:29.960 --> 07:32.000
Don't take as long as I did to see that.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.160
Excuse me.

07:49.520 --> 07:50.520
Marisol!

07:52.600 --> 07:53.520
Marisol.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.360
Hello. How are you?

07:56.440 --> 07:59.040
Happy New Year, belatedly.

08:00.200 --> 08:02.960
This is for you.
You deserve an apology from me.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.280
I thought you wanted to steal
my Pablo from me,

08:05.360 --> 08:10.000
and, you know, jealousy, it blinds you.
You can't see. So here...

08:12.080 --> 08:14.000
I apologize for everything.

08:19.240 --> 08:20.560
You steal my fiancé,

08:20.640 --> 08:23.200
and think you can fix it
with a bouquet of flowers?

08:26.960 --> 08:30.920
Get this straight. Pablo is mine.
I'll get him back, whatever it takes.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.159
Is that clear?

08:33.240 --> 08:36.080
I knew it.
I knew I couldn't trust you!

08:36.960 --> 08:39.400
You're a snake! A boyfriend stealer!

08:39.480 --> 08:41.799
Marga! What are you doing?

08:41.880 --> 08:46.680
I came to apologize. I brought flowers,
and look, she threw them on the floor!

08:46.760 --> 08:49.520
It's a lie, Pablo. All a lie.

08:50.240 --> 08:51.920
Honey, your father's awake.

08:55.760 --> 08:57.480
Are you sure about this?

08:57.960 --> 09:01.640
No one will believe you can die
from a tonsillectomy.

09:01.720 --> 09:03.320
Be quiet, Mother. No one knows.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.520
Marga, I think you'd better go.

09:23.320 --> 09:26.600
Tomorrow, you're going to feel like
you were hit with that bottle

09:26.680 --> 09:28.120
instead of drinking it.

09:31.480 --> 09:32.520
May I?

09:34.040 --> 09:34.880
Sure.

09:43.440 --> 09:44.920
Now I understand.

09:46.880 --> 09:47.840
She said no.

09:50.920 --> 09:52.160
She said yes...

09:54.400 --> 09:56.960
but with bad intentions.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.600
What are you doing here?

10:00.240 --> 10:05.840
Some guy promised to show me
the best bars in Madrid...

10:07.400 --> 10:09.200
and here I am, still waiting.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.000
What are you having? It's on me.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.280
I think you've had enough to drink, huh?

10:25.360 --> 10:28.520
Besides, I know a better way
to get over someone.

11:23.440 --> 11:27.240
It was obvious that Carlos and Alex
had spent the night together.

11:35.680 --> 11:39.120
Right then,
I felt an inexplicable, stabbing pain.

11:41.480 --> 11:42.480
Lidia.

11:42.960 --> 11:45.680
Sorry I'm late.
I couldn't get out of bed today.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.320
-Are you all right?
-Yes. Sure.

11:51.520 --> 11:53.440
Next time just send the chauffeur.

11:53.960 --> 11:55.800
My brother treats me like a child.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.400
I'd never considered myself
a jealous person.

11:58.480 --> 12:03.360
But that day, fear erupted inside me,
putting me to the test.

12:04.160 --> 12:06.440
I couldn't have imagined
to what degree.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.200
Thank you, Héctor.

12:18.040 --> 12:19.240
Are you all right?

12:20.800 --> 12:21.760
Yes.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.840
Yes, don't worry. Thank you.

12:29.840 --> 12:33.040
One moment, miss.
Open your handbag, please.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.040
Why?

12:34.120 --> 12:37.200
You must identify yourself
and submit to a bag check to come in.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.760
Lidia Aguilar, assistant manager.

12:50.800 --> 12:51.920
Thank you.

13:02.720 --> 13:04.640
What's going on?

13:04.720 --> 13:08.040
"One, all staff must be searched
upon entering and exiting the building.

13:08.120 --> 13:12.320
All workers must have their bags searched
at the start and end of each day.

13:12.400 --> 13:17.600
Two, no one has access to restricted areas
without authorization."

13:17.680 --> 13:19.760
Mario's robbery
is going to ruin our lives.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.920
It's not that! It's an excuse!

13:22.000 --> 13:25.400
They're tyrants. They think
we're sheep, but we can't allow it!

13:25.480 --> 13:27.480
Quiet, please! Quiet!

13:31.800 --> 13:35.160
Thank you.
I'll just take a few minutes of your time.

13:35.840 --> 13:39.200
As you well know,
a worker in this company

13:39.680 --> 13:44.440
has betrayed our trust,
and has stolen a sum of money.

13:44.520 --> 13:48.480
So that this doesn't happen again,
we have been forced to implement

13:48.560 --> 13:51.320
the new security measures
you've just seen.

13:51.800 --> 13:54.320
And to make sure
these are complied with,

13:54.400 --> 13:58.160
we're appointing new officers
whose main role

13:58.240 --> 14:01.800
will be to oversee the employees
they're responsible for

14:01.880 --> 14:05.960
and report any suspicious behavior.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.360
Quiet! Quiet, please!

14:08.440 --> 14:12.080
You can't do that!
It's an assault on our freedom!

14:12.160 --> 14:13.400
Who said that?

14:13.880 --> 14:17.080
-Carlota Rodríguez, operator.
-Carlota, please...

14:17.160 --> 14:21.000
You can't force us to let you search
our personal belongings.

14:21.080 --> 14:23.400
It's an invasion of our privacy.

14:23.480 --> 14:27.520
Non-compliance with these rules
means instant dismissal, miss.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.840
Each of you can decide
the price you put on privacy.

14:30.920 --> 14:33.840
Really? Well, we won't stand by
and do nothing!

14:33.920 --> 14:37.080
We're the backbone of this company
and we have a right to protest!

14:37.160 --> 14:39.800
Very well. You've just been relieved
of your duties.

14:39.880 --> 14:43.520
You're reassigned to the filing room
until further notice.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.200
Anyone have anything else to add?

14:46.280 --> 14:49.040
-Are you going to stand for this?
-Be quiet. Are you crazy?

14:49.120 --> 14:50.720
This won't achieve anything. Calm down.

14:50.800 --> 14:54.080
Very well.
Thank you for your understanding.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.680
Please get back to work. Thank you.

15:05.920 --> 15:09.360
Excuse me. I wanted to speak to Mr. Uribe.

15:09.440 --> 15:12.800
-What did you want to discuss?
-I'd rather speak to him. Thanks.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.040
No, no. Maybe I can help you.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.040
Women understand each other better.

15:23.600 --> 15:26.920
You should reconsider
the new security measures.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.880
These measures call into question
the promises your brother made.

15:30.960 --> 15:33.640
Carlota's punishment is unfair.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.600
-She's one of the best--
-I don't care if it's fair.

15:38.880 --> 15:41.680
You don't make the decisions,
Miss Aguilar.

15:45.720 --> 15:48.800
-But, sir, you promised--
-I don't recall what I promised you.

15:48.880 --> 15:53.040
But I do recall that you work here
as my assistant.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.000
Either you develop a decent project,
or you'll be fired.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.880
Now if you'll excuse me,
I want to speak to my sister.

15:59.320 --> 16:00.160
Lidia.

16:01.440 --> 16:04.400
Find a replacement
for your friend Carlota.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.360
I don't know how long
she'll be in the filing room.

16:08.600 --> 16:09.840
Thank you.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.840
Let this be the last time

16:18.920 --> 16:22.120
that you make a decision
without consulting me first.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.840
-But--
-I give the orders around here!

16:24.920 --> 16:27.160
Someone had to respond to the theft.

16:27.240 --> 16:30.560
The police are on it. They'll solve this.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.920
Yes, but we have to teach the others
a lesson.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.240
We can't show weakness,
or someone else will steal from us.

16:37.320 --> 16:41.760
I don't want to jeopardize the trust
that I worked hard to build.

16:42.320 --> 16:44.160
I'm doing things differently.

16:44.240 --> 16:46.000
That's obvious.

16:46.080 --> 16:49.080
You've changed.
Spain won't bring the old Sebastián back.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.720
-Shut up.
-Stop punishing yourself--

16:51.800 --> 16:53.160
I said to shut up!

16:54.920 --> 16:58.960
-This trip has nothing to do with that.
-It doesn't? Then what is it?

16:59.040 --> 17:01.040
Why did you leave without a word to us?

17:01.920 --> 17:04.360
Why did it take you so long
to get back in contact?

17:07.200 --> 17:08.760
Can we discuss this some other time?

17:14.640 --> 17:16.200
You are a cheater.

17:18.280 --> 17:19.200
Excuse me?

17:20.359 --> 17:23.520
You slept with Alex
to gain an advantage and win.

17:26.480 --> 17:29.960
You’re so self-centered, Alba.
Not everything is about you.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.800
You haven't stopped to think
that I slept with her

17:32.880 --> 17:35.000
because I wanted to sleep with her?

17:35.080 --> 17:37.680
Plus I actually enjoy
this woman's company in bed.

17:42.640 --> 17:46.320
You are rude.
And you are lying to me.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.680
You haven't forgotten me,
Carlos Cifuentes.

17:48.760 --> 17:52.800
And every minute that passes
in your miserable life, you think of me...

17:53.920 --> 17:55.960
even though you are sleeping with her.

17:57.280 --> 17:58.400
No.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.520
Whenever I think of you
I remember how much I hate you,

18:03.520 --> 18:05.480
and how easy it will be
to destroy you.

18:08.360 --> 18:10.320
We have something in common then,

18:11.200 --> 18:13.920
because I have the same thoughts
about you.

18:15.400 --> 18:16.600
Is there a problem?

18:18.200 --> 18:20.920
No, no. We were just talking.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.200
What happened?

18:26.840 --> 18:29.400
Do you know what Alex Uribe is doing?

18:29.480 --> 18:30.560
No.

18:30.640 --> 18:34.280
She has turned this company upside down.
She's losing her mind.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.520
She punished Carlota for complaining.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.800
-That I won't allow.
-Lidia, Lidia...

18:40.000 --> 18:41.960
We have to focus on the project.

18:42.040 --> 18:46.120
The best way to change things
is for us to get control of the company.

18:46.920 --> 18:48.320
And soon it could be yours.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.240
You're right.

18:55.640 --> 18:58.880
But unfortunately, I have to find
Carlota's replacement.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.600
I will see you later.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
They can't do that.

19:16.560 --> 19:17.520
I'm afraid they can.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.840
I don't know how to resolve this
without risking your job.

19:23.680 --> 19:24.760
Ángeles.

20:07.040 --> 20:10.000
-Inspector Cuevas. What brings you here?
-May I come in?

20:12.840 --> 20:14.200
Thank you.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.760
What's happened?

20:20.560 --> 20:24.200
Have you found my husband?
Has he gone to Bilbao?

20:28.160 --> 20:30.040
You're looking for his car?

20:30.680 --> 20:32.800
We're looking for any clue
that leads to him,

20:32.880 --> 20:34.880
and his car has disappeared.

20:34.960 --> 20:37.640
But the train schedule
I found in the garbage,

20:37.720 --> 20:39.560
and the note he left?

20:39.640 --> 20:42.400
I thought it was obvious
he ran off with another woman.

20:42.480 --> 20:43.520
I don't get it.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.080
It's one possibility among many.

20:45.760 --> 20:47.440
We're not ruling out anything.

20:47.520 --> 20:49.760
So I need to search your home.

20:49.840 --> 20:50.680
My house?

20:52.400 --> 20:55.560
When Mario left the note,
he may have left a clue you overlooked.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.480
-Do you mind if I...
-No.

20:59.360 --> 21:00.840
Go ahead.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.760
I can make you some breakfast.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.560
-May I?
-Of course.

21:51.760 --> 21:53.000
And these photos?

21:53.840 --> 21:55.080
That was me.

21:56.760 --> 21:59.920
When I found out that Mario
had run off with another woman.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.120
I had a fit of jealousy.

22:02.840 --> 22:04.880
Now I don't know what to think.

22:06.320 --> 22:07.440
I see.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.480
May I look in your bedroom?

22:10.560 --> 22:11.760
Of course.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.200
Thank you.

22:30.600 --> 22:33.400
Well, it's getting late. I should go.

22:33.480 --> 22:34.400
Already?

22:35.720 --> 22:36.920
What about the bedroom?

22:39.040 --> 22:42.440
That's enough for now.
I have other things to attend to.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.400
Thank you for your cooperation.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.200
What nonsense.
You're not searching my handbag.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.880
I'm sorry, ma'am, but I can't let you in.

23:03.960 --> 23:05.800
Don't you know who I am?

23:05.880 --> 23:08.720
In the old days,
I could have had you fired on the spot.

23:08.800 --> 23:11.120
Guard, let her through.

23:13.920 --> 23:15.240
Carmen, I'm sorry.

23:15.320 --> 23:19.280
We've given an order to search anyone
entering or leaving.

23:19.360 --> 23:21.000
I'm not a worker.

23:21.400 --> 23:25.240
This company means more to me
than all of you.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.200
And if you're calling me a thief--

23:27.280 --> 23:28.680
No, please, I didn't say that.

23:30.320 --> 23:32.880
Well... where's your brother?

23:32.960 --> 23:35.960
We were going to discuss some matters
related to the foundation.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.480
But seeing all this,
God knows what I should expect.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.280
He must be on his second home run.

23:40.360 --> 23:41.400
Come again?

23:42.160 --> 23:44.040
Pitch it. Pitch it.

23:45.080 --> 23:47.800
How about that!

23:47.880 --> 23:48.760
Mr. Uribe?

23:49.440 --> 23:51.000
Good morning, Doña Carmen.

23:51.080 --> 23:52.360
Pitch another one. Pitch it.

23:53.080 --> 23:55.120
Elisa, what are you doing here?

23:55.200 --> 23:57.880
Sebastián was showing me
how to play baseball,

23:57.960 --> 23:59.480
and he thinks I'm not bad.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.560
So much exercise isn't good for you.

24:01.640 --> 24:04.320
You should be resting at home.

24:04.400 --> 24:08.200
I knew Sebastián called you
to talk about the foundation and...

24:08.280 --> 24:09.480
you know I want to help.

24:09.560 --> 24:12.840
I'm just worried that
such frenzied activity will do you harm.

24:12.920 --> 24:15.760
-I wouldn't want you to have a relapse.
-I won't.

24:15.840 --> 24:19.760
It'll do me good to get involved
in the foundation, to feel useful.

24:20.520 --> 24:23.200
In that case, why don't all three of us
go to my office?

24:28.120 --> 24:29.840
I don't know if you're aware,

24:29.920 --> 24:33.440
but we're implementing
new security measures for the staff.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.320
I just endured them myself.

24:36.400 --> 24:40.920
They tried to search my handbag
as if I were a common thief.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.760
I'm sorry. I am, but with this theft,

24:44.840 --> 24:47.360
you'll understand
that no precaution is too small.

24:47.440 --> 24:50.200
And we can't make distinctions
between employees

24:50.280 --> 24:52.000
in order to avoid tension.

24:52.080 --> 24:54.240
We have to treat everyone equally.

24:54.320 --> 24:55.720
But we're not all equal.

24:55.800 --> 25:01.800
Why don't we put this issue aside for now
and focus on the matter at hand today?

25:03.160 --> 25:04.440
The foundation's accounts.

25:05.480 --> 25:09.840
I see this is going to be
an ongoing issue.

25:09.920 --> 25:13.640
Have you discovered another incident?

25:13.720 --> 25:16.200
No, we haven't

25:16.280 --> 25:20.240
because we don't have access
to the foundation's accounts.

25:20.320 --> 25:24.960
Well, that's because
the foundation is run independently.

25:25.040 --> 25:28.520
Sure, but in the end,
it's not independent.

25:29.760 --> 25:34.760
I'd just like to see the accounts
to ensure everything's managed properly.

25:36.200 --> 25:37.320
I don't see the problem.

25:37.400 --> 25:39.920
You've got nothing to hide,
do you, Doña Carmen?

25:40.600 --> 25:43.160
-Of course not.
-Don't worry, Mr. Uribe.

25:43.240 --> 25:47.680
I will personally help my mother
with the books.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.680
We'll get them to you this week.

25:50.760 --> 25:54.280
Pretty, determined
and she's got the makings of a pitcher.

25:54.360 --> 25:58.720
You never cease to surprise me,
Miss Cifuentes.

25:58.800 --> 26:01.400
I'll see you before the week is out, then.

26:01.480 --> 26:03.880
Very well. See you soon.

26:04.720 --> 26:07.000
Please. It's always a pleasure...

26:08.720 --> 26:10.200
to see you both.

26:12.920 --> 26:14.680
Have a good day.

26:17.240 --> 26:21.080
Elisa, first I want to know
whose side you're on.

26:21.840 --> 26:24.040
Mother, there's one thing I'm sure of.

26:24.120 --> 26:26.200
You won't let me be on your side.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.000
Very well.

26:29.440 --> 26:32.640
We'll meet this afternoon
at the foundation's office.

26:32.720 --> 26:34.160
At 5:00.

26:35.320 --> 26:36.520
I'll be there.

27:07.320 --> 27:09.120
Are you ready to start tomorrow?

27:09.200 --> 27:11.840
Yes. I'm looking forward to it.

27:11.920 --> 27:14.680
And thank you so much
for this chance, Mr. Uribe,

27:14.760 --> 27:17.320
especially after how
my husband treated the company.

27:17.400 --> 27:22.200
We'd be in a bad state if wives had to pay
for the crimes of their husbands.

27:23.080 --> 27:25.760
You're not responsible
for that scoundrel's actions.

27:25.840 --> 27:28.600
Mario committed a crime
when he stole from me,

27:28.680 --> 27:30.480
but his real mistake was leaving you.

27:31.480 --> 27:34.440
Only a fool would make such a mistake.

27:34.520 --> 27:37.120
I won't argue with you about that.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.800
We'd better be going.

27:40.680 --> 27:42.800
What's the rush, Miss Aguilar?

27:42.880 --> 27:45.680
We don't want to take up
any more of your time, Mr. Uribe.

27:47.280 --> 27:50.080
Don't hesitate to ask me
for whatever you need, Mr. Uribe,

27:50.160 --> 27:52.160
and I'll try to please you.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.480
I'm glad to hear that.

28:00.040 --> 28:03.400
You'd better come with me
to get your uniform. Let's go.

28:10.760 --> 28:13.360
I'm starting to think it's a bad idea
that you came back--

28:13.440 --> 28:14.600
No...

28:15.880 --> 28:17.000
Ángeles,

28:17.680 --> 28:20.640
now, more than ever,
we have to be very discreet.

28:20.720 --> 28:24.040
The police are still investigating.
Have you heard anything?

28:24.120 --> 28:26.640
No, and I need this job, Lidia.

28:26.720 --> 28:30.400
All this time shut in at home,
I've felt dead.

28:33.320 --> 28:34.680
But I'm finally free.

28:35.760 --> 28:38.800
Do you know how often
I've dreamed of this moment?

28:40.240 --> 28:43.960
Really, I won't do anything
to put us in danger.

28:44.040 --> 28:45.240
I won't, I promise.

28:54.320 --> 28:55.320
Ángeles.

28:57.400 --> 29:00.480
I'm so glad to see you here again.
How are you?

29:01.840 --> 29:05.560
You know how these things are.
It's very hard.

29:05.640 --> 29:06.560
I suppose so.

29:06.640 --> 29:09.800
I read the papers. It seems the police
are searching for the car.

29:11.760 --> 29:14.000
To think I saw you leaving together.

29:16.480 --> 29:18.600
Mr. Cifuentes...

29:19.960 --> 29:21.160
that's impossible.

29:22.040 --> 29:24.000
I left beforehand and...

29:25.640 --> 29:27.600
You're mistaken. My husband left alone.

29:31.320 --> 29:33.000
Ángeles, I'm sorry, but...

29:34.520 --> 29:37.600
I clearly saw a woman
in the passenger seat.

29:41.720 --> 29:43.120
You really saw that?

29:51.760 --> 29:53.200
Oh, my God.

29:55.480 --> 29:58.440
Last night, I found a goodbye note
from my husband.

29:59.160 --> 30:02.160
He said he'd started a new life
with another woman.

30:02.240 --> 30:06.000
I'm so sorry. I was stupid. Forgive me.

30:06.080 --> 30:08.480
No, you had no idea. God...

30:10.720 --> 30:13.600
Maybe what I saw is relevant
to the investigation.

30:13.680 --> 30:16.000
I'll go to the police station today
and tell them--

30:16.080 --> 30:18.120
No, no, no.

30:18.200 --> 30:22.760
I mean, if anyone should go to the police,
it's me.

30:23.360 --> 30:27.800
I gave them the note, and honestly,
I don't want to bother you anymore.

30:27.880 --> 30:29.040
As you wish.

30:29.640 --> 30:32.240
And if there's anything I can do
to help...

30:32.320 --> 30:34.240
-please...
-Don't worry.

30:42.960 --> 30:44.120
Good heavens!

30:44.200 --> 30:46.680
You knew this crook?

30:46.760 --> 30:49.520
A little. Just in passing, Grandma.

30:49.600 --> 30:53.000
The worst part is
that things are a mess around here.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.120
They've set up security
at the building's entrance

30:57.200 --> 30:59.840
and they search our handbags
when we go in and out.

30:59.920 --> 31:02.520
I noticed you sounded sad, dear.

31:02.600 --> 31:03.800
Right.

31:04.640 --> 31:07.320
It's been tough lately, Grandma.

31:07.400 --> 31:11.280
I won't lie to you.
And without my Pablo, I'm...

31:11.360 --> 31:14.000
Good Lord.
What do you mean "without your Pablo"?

31:14.560 --> 31:16.560
Don't tell me you said no!

31:17.920 --> 31:18.760
No to what?

31:20.120 --> 31:21.360
Hasn't he asked you yet?

31:23.520 --> 31:24.360
Asked me what?

31:27.840 --> 31:32.040
Forget it. Don't listen to me.
I'm starting to go senile.

31:33.240 --> 31:35.880
-Call me another day--
-Hang up on me and I swear

31:35.960 --> 31:38.680
I'll take the first bus back
and pull on your hair until you tell me.

31:38.760 --> 31:41.600
-Ask me what?
-To marry him, dear.

31:41.680 --> 31:44.360
Pablo wants you to marry him.

31:44.440 --> 31:45.840
What, Grandma?

31:48.000 --> 31:51.880
-You'll make me deaf.
-How do you know and I don't?

31:51.960 --> 31:53.840
Because he told me.

31:53.920 --> 31:57.320
He was going to propose
the day we had those cream puffs.

31:57.400 --> 32:01.040
They were delicious.
My mouth's still watering--

32:01.120 --> 32:03.000
Grandma, concentrate. Tell me about it.

32:04.120 --> 32:09.160
Just that he put the ring in one of
the cream puffs and I gobbled it down.

32:09.240 --> 32:11.160
Since then I've--

32:11.240 --> 32:14.160
Grandma, I have to hang up.
I'll call you some other day.

32:24.800 --> 32:27.200
-Where are you going, miss?
-To see my boyfriend.

32:27.280 --> 32:29.520
The one with dark, curly hair.
Pablo Santos.

32:29.600 --> 32:30.600
This floor's restricted.

32:30.680 --> 32:33.800
Without a special pass, you'll have
to wait till the end of the day.

32:33.880 --> 32:36.280
-But I just want to talk to him.
-I'm sorry.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.440
-Forgive me, I beg you.
-What are you doing here?

32:45.520 --> 32:48.040
I know I haven’t been myself lately,

32:48.120 --> 32:50.400
but I promise you
that's all going to change.

32:50.480 --> 32:53.640
No more Marisol or silly jealousy,
I swear.

32:54.360 --> 32:57.480
Give me a chance. One last one.

32:57.560 --> 33:00.840
Come to the boarding house tonight
and I'll prove that you can trust me.

33:00.920 --> 33:03.400
No more lies, I promise!
Get your hands off me!

33:03.480 --> 33:05.200
You won't regret it!

33:22.320 --> 33:23.480
Hi.

33:25.800 --> 33:26.960
What are you doing here?

33:27.040 --> 33:30.040
I wanted to talk to Pablo,
but it seems I need a special pass.

33:30.120 --> 33:31.720
This is outrageous.

33:31.800 --> 33:34.840
Are they going to punish everyone
by sending them to the filing room?

33:34.920 --> 33:36.840
Soon it'll be as crowded
as the market in my hometown.

33:37.520 --> 33:38.400
Do you know what?

33:39.840 --> 33:40.720
I'm sick of this.

33:41.520 --> 33:44.040
I won't let these tyrants
get away with it.

33:44.120 --> 33:47.080
What are we going to do?
We have to grin and bear it--

33:47.160 --> 33:49.040
They are not in charge here!

33:49.600 --> 33:51.000
We are!

33:51.320 --> 33:55.520
-Who? You and I?
-You and I. The workers.

33:55.600 --> 33:58.520
There's strength in numbers.
We can't on our own, but together we can.

33:58.600 --> 34:00.480
What are you talking about?

34:01.080 --> 34:05.240
If we need to, we'll start a union.

34:05.320 --> 34:07.000
We have to resist oppression.

34:07.080 --> 34:10.080
We'll gather the operators together
and convince them to join us.

34:10.159 --> 34:12.639
I don't know why,
but I think this will end badly.

34:12.719 --> 34:14.320
It'll end how it has to end...

34:14.400 --> 34:15.560
with a rebellion.

34:15.639 --> 34:17.120
I'm telling Sara right now.

34:18.280 --> 34:22.320
Carlota, wait.
Carlota, let's think this over!

34:23.719 --> 34:26.800
-We have to talk.
-You scared me. What is it?

34:26.880 --> 34:28.800
I was thinking about the memo
and the new rules,

34:28.880 --> 34:30.280
and we have to do something.

34:31.360 --> 34:34.040
-Do you want to set up barricades?
-Something like that.

34:34.120 --> 34:37.080
We could gather the operators
in the bar tomorrow.

34:37.160 --> 34:39.480
If you're with the cause,
they'll all support you.

34:40.160 --> 34:43.440
I thought
we could work on the idea tonight.

34:44.480 --> 34:46.199
-Tonight?
-The sooner the better.

34:48.040 --> 34:49.199
I have plans for tonight.

34:50.960 --> 34:54.239
You didn't mention any plans.
Who did you make plans with?

34:55.360 --> 34:58.800
With Berta, a friend.
Didn't I tell you about her?

34:59.720 --> 35:04.280
Her neighbors want to report her
because they saw her bring a woman home.

35:04.360 --> 35:05.600
She asked for my support.

35:05.680 --> 35:06.600
I can go with you--

35:06.680 --> 35:09.200
No, Carlota, don't worry.
I'd rather go alone.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.560
She's having a hard time,

35:11.640 --> 35:14.440
and strangers
might make her feel uncomfortable.

35:14.520 --> 35:15.800
I'll tell you about it later.

35:44.400 --> 35:45.880
CASTILLO GUESTHOUSE

35:47.080 --> 35:48.400
Castillo Guesthouse. Hello?

35:48.480 --> 35:51.160
Good morning. I'm Miss Millán's secretary.

35:51.240 --> 35:53.880
I wanted to confirm her reservation
for tonight.

35:53.960 --> 35:56.480
Room 47.

35:56.560 --> 35:57.720
Room 47?

35:58.320 --> 36:00.040
No, impossible.

36:00.120 --> 36:03.840
That room is reserved
in the name of Mr. Oscar Ruiz.

36:04.600 --> 36:06.600
We have other rooms, if you wish.

36:08.880 --> 36:10.560
Miss, can you hear me?

36:12.280 --> 36:14.000
Would you like another room?

36:14.080 --> 36:15.160
Hello?

36:15.640 --> 36:18.400
We should start
by installing public booths.

36:19.160 --> 36:22.200
Only in the main cities,
or costs will skyrocket.

36:22.280 --> 36:23.600
No, no.

36:23.680 --> 36:26.840
The aim of the project
is to give everyone access to telephones.

36:27.520 --> 36:29.200
If we restrict it to just a few,

36:29.280 --> 36:33.120
it'll go back to being a tool
for the rich.

36:33.200 --> 36:35.360
But Uribe will look at the figures first.

36:35.440 --> 36:36.680
Yes, but we can't--

36:36.760 --> 36:37.800
Good afternoon.

36:40.080 --> 36:42.240
I don't believe we've been introduced.

36:43.320 --> 36:45.160
-Alex Uribe.
-Francisco Gómez.

36:45.600 --> 36:47.040
Nice to meet you.

36:47.120 --> 36:51.120
Francisco is helping me
with my phone booth project.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.720
-In that case, welcome.
-Thank you.

36:54.280 --> 36:59.760
Lidia, why wasn't I informed that
Miss Rodríguez de Senillosa's substitute

36:59.840 --> 37:02.720
is the wife of the man
who robbed the company?

37:03.320 --> 37:08.800
Well, I was asked to find a substitute
and I believe I found the best.

37:09.520 --> 37:11.480
Ángeles worked here for many years,

37:11.560 --> 37:15.600
and I can say she's one of the finest
professionals this company's seen.

37:15.680 --> 37:17.680
Yes, and the wife of a thief.

37:20.080 --> 37:22.200
She's nothing like her husband.

37:22.280 --> 37:26.160
Besides, your brother, the director
of this company, approved of her,

37:26.240 --> 37:28.560
so if you have a problem--

37:28.640 --> 37:31.680
No, the only problem here
is your attitude.

37:33.400 --> 37:36.040
-What have you got against me?
-Lidia, please.

37:36.920 --> 37:41.520
Yes. Control your friend,
or she'll have serious trouble here.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
-What are you doing?
-Don't worry.

37:58.640 --> 38:01.040
That woman is judging the project.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.480
You can't fight with her.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.560
This morning I went to pick her up...

38:08.800 --> 38:10.680
and saw Carlos leaving her hotel.

38:13.800 --> 38:17.560
I'm sure he's trying to get ahead,

38:17.640 --> 38:21.080
and he's only sleeping with her
to gain an advantage.

38:21.160 --> 38:22.480
Forget about Carlos.

38:22.560 --> 38:25.320
Move on or you'll be trapped
in a dead relationship--

38:25.400 --> 38:27.880
Francisco, it's none of your business!

38:29.440 --> 38:31.520
I think it is. More than you think.

38:33.760 --> 38:34.880
I give up.

38:36.160 --> 38:38.040
I want no part of this deception.

38:39.600 --> 38:43.720
I don't know if this project
is your dream, as you said,

38:44.400 --> 38:47.000
or your last chance to get Carlos back.

39:02.720 --> 39:03.800
What's wrong?

39:08.000 --> 39:10.520
Lidia saw you leaving Alex's hotel
this morning.

39:11.480 --> 39:12.920
She was waiting for her.

39:17.280 --> 39:18.400
You're happy?

39:22.880 --> 39:24.360
What's your game, Carlos?

39:25.200 --> 39:26.280
I don't know.

39:27.280 --> 39:30.560
Maybe Alex is my plan B,
in case you betray me with Lidia.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.960
I know you're still in love with her.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.600
I want that budget now, Francisco.

39:35.680 --> 39:38.440
My private life's
got nothing to do with you.

39:45.120 --> 39:47.600
CARMEN DE CIFUENTES
FOUNDATION DIRECTOR

40:22.480 --> 40:24.480
You don’t know what you missed, Doña Lola.

40:24.560 --> 40:27.800
They all but frisked us against the wall
like criminals.

40:27.880 --> 40:31.280
-Don't let them put a hand on you.
-No, of course not.

40:31.360 --> 40:34.200
The girls are meeting tomorrow
to present our complaints.

40:34.280 --> 40:38.320
That's not the way, either. It's better
to watch the bulls from the bleachers.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.120
Keep quiet and be careful.

40:41.880 --> 40:44.200
No candles!
The house will look like a bordello.

40:44.280 --> 40:47.080
Turn the lights up. It's enough
that I'm leaving you two alone.

40:47.160 --> 40:48.800
It's meant to be a romantic dinner.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.120
It will be, but without candles,
and no wine.

40:51.200 --> 40:55.160
You’ll get tipsy and do things
that only married women do.

40:55.240 --> 40:57.000
It's enough that I'm leaving you alone.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.880
You don't want to join us, do you?

41:00.040 --> 41:01.200
It's him!

41:01.280 --> 41:02.760
He's 15 minutes early.

41:02.840 --> 41:05.560
I told you,
this man is in too much of a hurry.

41:05.640 --> 41:09.440
Don't you worry. Trust me.
Go to bed. You must be exhausted.

41:09.520 --> 41:14.120
You said you're to be engaged,
otherwise I wouldn't allow this.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.960
You're so early...

41:19.040 --> 41:20.040
Marisol?

41:21.480 --> 41:23.080
What are you doing here?

41:24.360 --> 41:27.560
I just came to tell you that your Pablo...

41:28.960 --> 41:30.080
is now my Pablo.

41:31.360 --> 41:32.400
Isn't it pretty?

41:34.080 --> 41:37.200
That's my grandmother's ring.
Why do you have it?

41:37.280 --> 41:38.480
Hello.

41:40.440 --> 41:41.880
Marisol, what are you doing here?

41:45.200 --> 41:46.840
I never want to see you again!

41:48.400 --> 41:51.440
Jealousy makes us say things
we don't really feel.

41:55.840 --> 41:57.840
Marga! Marga!

42:03.360 --> 42:07.400
Jealousy makes us do things
we never thought we'd do.

42:13.160 --> 42:15.440
Room 47, please.

42:20.560 --> 42:22.480
Don Francisco left this for you.

42:25.200 --> 42:26.840
Good night.

42:28.960 --> 42:31.160
Miss, will you be needing the car?

42:31.240 --> 42:34.720
No, never mind, Héctor.
I have a ride. Thank you.

42:35.880 --> 42:37.600
Jealousy kills.

42:52.120 --> 42:54.720
Sorry it's so late.
I came as soon as you called.

42:55.360 --> 42:58.280
Don't worry. I wanted to speak to you
as soon as possible.

42:59.840 --> 43:01.400
Are you just going to stand there?

43:15.200 --> 43:19.040
That’s why, when you realize this,
you have to distance yourself,

43:19.120 --> 43:22.680
and not allow jealousy
to keep distorting your feelings.

43:34.120 --> 43:37.080
That's the only way
you'll recognize true love.

43:39.040 --> 43:42.280
I'm sorry about today. Whatever happens,
this project is worth it.

43:42.360 --> 43:44.960
The numbers confirm it, and here they are.

43:54.760 --> 43:55.720
I'm sorry.

43:56.720 --> 43:59.400
You were right. About everything.

44:01.920 --> 44:03.000
Now what do we do?

44:05.000 --> 44:07.440
My name's Carlota Rodríguez and...

44:07.520 --> 44:09.360
I'm looking for an Oscar Ruiz.

44:10.240 --> 44:11.880
And be able to take a chance on it.

44:12.920 --> 44:15.240
Free, without prejudices.
