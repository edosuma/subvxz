00:24.874 --> 00:28.778
When I was a kid,
my mama had this dog.

00:30.580 --> 00:32.183
It was a little poodle named
Sammy.

00:33.883 --> 00:35.719
He used to do all kind a tricks
like

00:35.752 --> 00:38.289
walk on his hind legs,
spin around in circles.

00:38.322 --> 00:40.623
You know, all that cute
little poodle shit.

00:42.625 --> 00:44.028
Then one day my mama was walking
him

00:44.061 --> 00:47.131
and she ran into this pit
bull and it looked mean

00:47.164 --> 00:49.733
but she gave it the benefit of
the doubt.

00:49.766 --> 00:52.569
She put her hand out to pet
it and it growled at her.

00:53.770 --> 00:56.273
Well little Sammy,

00:56.307 --> 00:57.741
he wanted to protect her from
that pit.

00:57.774 --> 01:00.144
So he started barking
at it and that was all

01:00.177 --> 01:02.313
it took for that pit to put
little Sammy on his back,

01:02.346 --> 01:04.647
wrap his jaw around his neck and
kill him.

01:08.651 --> 01:10.287
Mama didn't do nothing about it.

01:10.321 --> 01:12.522
She thought maybe it was Sammy's
fault.

01:14.791 --> 01:15.925
He shouldn't a barked.

01:26.603 --> 01:28.172
- Calvin?
- Hi, Amy?

01:28.205 --> 01:29.273
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:32.343 --> 01:34.178
You know, I forgot something
inside.

01:34.211 --> 01:35.578
I'm just gonna run back in

01:35.612 --> 01:36.780
and you know what, you can go
ahead.

01:36.813 --> 01:38.915
I'm just gonna catch another
ride.

01:38.948 --> 01:39.984
Are you sure? I mean, it's all
good.

01:40.017 --> 01:41.551
I don't mind waiting for you.

01:44.088 --> 01:45.222
I'm not in a hurry or anything.

01:46.957 --> 01:47.924
I'm sorry.

01:49.226 --> 01:50.094
I'm sorry.

02:04.108 --> 02:06.210
A couple of weeks
passed.

02:06.243 --> 02:08.678
The pit did the same thing
to her neighbor's cat

02:09.980 --> 02:11.948
and then to the laundromat
owner's dog.

02:21.891 --> 02:23.227
Mama always felt guilty that

02:23.260 --> 02:24.995
she never warned nobody about
pit.

02:48.285 --> 02:51.188
You can't see me but
I can see you, Patrick.

02:52.089 --> 02:54.024
It's an invasion of privacy.

02:54.058 --> 02:55.792
I can't even skinny dip anymore.

02:55.825 --> 03:00.030
People think being a celebrity
is easy and they're right,

03:00.064 --> 03:01.898
thanks to Alpha Nodrun Security.

03:03.033 --> 03:04.801
I hate drones.

03:04.834 --> 03:07.138
What's up? The signal's
gone.

03:07.171 --> 03:09.406
Where's my drone?

03:09.440 --> 03:11.941
Thanks,
Alpha Nodrun Security.

03:15.745 --> 03:16.413
That's it?

03:24.921 --> 03:27.891
I like the fact that you're
using drones

03:27.924 --> 03:31.694
as not only part of the
problem but also the solution.

03:31.728 --> 03:32.396
Yeah.

03:35.332 --> 03:36.200
Cool.

03:37.468 --> 03:39.003
We think we can start with

03:39.036 --> 03:42.206
high end security for
clients like celebrities.

03:43.474 --> 03:44.841
How far along is it?

03:47.311 --> 03:49.746
Ready for you to try
a full-fledged demo.

03:52.949 --> 03:56.320
Do you think you guys could
take a trip up to Tahoe?

03:56.353 --> 04:00.224
I've got a property up there
on the lake, about 10 acres.

04:01.125 --> 04:03.460
Absolutely, thank you
for the opportunity.

04:03.494 --> 04:07.131
Look, I get pitched
about 30 phone apps a week.

04:08.199 --> 04:09.766
But as a venture capitalist,

04:09.799 --> 04:13.037
I find your technology to be
refreshing.

04:13.070 --> 04:16.839
Well like the video
says, it keeps people out.

04:17.508 --> 04:19.376
I'm not sure about the bears
though.

04:22.112 --> 04:22.980
You know, Tahoe.

04:24.215 --> 04:25.082
Bears.

04:26.849 --> 04:27.717
Cabin.

04:29.786 --> 04:30.787
Thank you guys.

04:34.124 --> 04:36.126
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

05:30.581 --> 05:32.182
I still need you to clean

05:32.216 --> 05:35.019
and to restock the
bathrooms before you split.

05:35.052 --> 05:36.153
- Yes sir.
- Okay.

05:53.903 --> 05:56.540
You taking a $15 an hour
stroll?

06:01.345 --> 06:04.048
I got a Tom Cushing on
the line in there for you.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.949
That's your probation officer,
right?

06:08.885 --> 06:11.588
97, that's how many days you
got left

06:11.622 --> 06:14.191
not to violate and fuck up your
parole.

06:14.224 --> 06:15.426
Yeah.

06:15.459 --> 06:18.128
A parolee starts missing
meetings

06:18.162 --> 06:21.931
and showing up late for work,
my mind starts to wonder

06:21.965 --> 06:24.901
that maybe I oughta to start
mentioning some of this

06:24.934 --> 06:27.604
shit in my reports, you
know, just to cover my ass.

06:27.638 --> 06:29.606
I don't think either one
of us wants that, do we?

06:29.640 --> 06:32.242
Listen, I'm not gonna
say anything if you don't.

06:34.044 --> 06:36.913
Just make sure your ass is
at that meeting tonight, man.

06:38.015 --> 06:38.881
I gotta go.

06:41.952 --> 06:44.154
I'm Gary, I'm an
alcoholic.

06:44.188 --> 06:46.223
Hey, Gary.

06:46.256 --> 06:48.158
The holidays are coming up.

06:49.126 --> 06:50.527
Crazy, right?

06:53.097 --> 06:57.434
Needless to say, the
holidays are tough on me

06:57.468 --> 07:01.472
and I know a lot of you
feel the same way and so

07:01.505 --> 07:05.275
let's just be especially there
for one another right now.

07:05.309 --> 07:09.446
You know, I wouldn't make
it through without you guys.

07:11.415 --> 07:12.983
Thank you.

07:13.016 --> 07:14.985
Thanks, Gary.

07:15.018 --> 07:15.953
Anyone else?

07:18.489 --> 07:19.356
Kyle?

07:22.292 --> 07:24.161
I don't really wanna talk
about it.

07:25.329 --> 07:26.196
That's it.

07:26.997 --> 07:30.033
- Thanks, Kyle.
- Thank you, Kyle.

07:30.067 --> 07:31.602
How about the birthday boy

07:32.503 --> 07:35.539
with his brand new six year
chip?

07:35.572 --> 07:37.674
Hold up your chip, Pete, come
on.

07:39.710 --> 07:41.078
- Say it, Pete.
- Yeah, Pete.

07:41.111 --> 07:43.913
All right, I guess I'll go.

07:45.482 --> 07:48.285
My name's Pete and I'm an
alcoholic.

07:48.318 --> 07:49.253
Hey Pete.

07:49.286 --> 07:51.622
I used to think drinking was
my problem,

07:52.523 --> 07:57.494
then I met Gary and I quickly
found out I was full of shit.

07:57.728 --> 08:01.165
Quickly? I think it
took about a year, Pete.

08:02.499 --> 08:04.268
It turns out my issue was
anger.

08:05.436 --> 08:09.640
Justified anger is the worst
kind of anger for an alcoholic

08:12.776 --> 08:14.944
and I found that out the hard
way,

08:16.213 --> 08:17.714
across the Bay in San Quentin.

08:19.183 --> 08:22.085
Which I do not recommend, by the
way.

08:25.155 --> 08:26.423
Yo Pete, wait up.

08:26.457 --> 08:28.392
Hey, I wanna talk to you.

08:28.425 --> 08:31.128
I'm sorry, I gotta get to
work.

08:31.161 --> 08:32.996
I thought you just came from
work.

08:34.765 --> 08:36.667
Oh, you're still working at that
bar?

08:36.700 --> 08:39.136
No wonder you've been
missing meetings lately.

08:40.771 --> 08:42.372
Your PO know about this?

08:43.240 --> 08:44.741
You know, he called me this
morning,

08:44.775 --> 08:47.311
asked about you and I
gotta tell him the truth.

08:47.344 --> 08:48.445
I get it, it's not your fault.

08:48.479 --> 08:50.681
If you gotta tell him the
truth, tell him the truth.

08:50.714 --> 08:53.250
I'm just letting you know I'm
just

08:53.283 --> 08:55.719
trying to make the fucking
rent this month, okay?

08:55.752 --> 08:57.654
You hang out in a
barber shop long enough,

08:57.688 --> 08:59.523
you're bound to get a haircut,
Pete.

09:01.058 --> 09:02.292
All right, you're right.

09:04.127 --> 09:07.397
Listen, I will give my notice
soon, okay?

09:09.132 --> 09:11.268
All right, man. You
do what you gotta do.

09:35.459 --> 09:37.628
- Hey, Fiona.
- Pete.

09:37.661 --> 09:39.129
What are you doing here?

09:39.162 --> 09:39.998
What do you mean what am I
doing here?

09:40.030 --> 09:41.698
You know I always work the dead
shifts.

09:41.732 --> 09:43.734
Oh no, I didn't know that.

09:43.767 --> 09:46.570
I was actually pretty
slammed about an hour ago.

09:46.603 --> 09:48.105
Oh by the way, thank you

09:48.138 --> 09:50.374
so much for switching shifts
with me.

09:50.407 --> 09:52.476
I started teaching this
killer hot yoga class

09:52.509 --> 09:55.379
on weeknights and Thursday's
my only free night.

09:55.412 --> 09:57.814
Oh my god, do you take hot yoga?

09:57.848 --> 09:58.715
You,

09:59.716 --> 10:01.418
nevermind.

10:01.451 --> 10:03.120
What?

10:03.153 --> 10:04.087
What the fuck?

10:05.289 --> 10:07.824
Todd, you got a mistake
here on the schedule.

10:07.858 --> 10:11.395
You've got Fiona on Thursday
nights. That's my night.

10:11.428 --> 10:14.097
No, no, no, she's
killing weeknights, man.

10:14.131 --> 10:16.466
Yeah well ever since you
took weekends away from me,

10:16.500 --> 10:19.336
Thursday night's my only
good night, it pays my bills.

10:20.571 --> 10:22.773
There's a thing called
Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter.

10:22.806 --> 10:24.575
You know how to use those?

10:24.608 --> 10:26.777
Because I don't think you do.

10:26.810 --> 10:29.546
Fiona on the other hand, she's
whip smart.

10:29.580 --> 10:31.682
She's kicking ass and she's
promoting the hell out of us.

10:31.715 --> 10:32.916
It's like quadrupled our crowd.

10:32.950 --> 10:36.453
Now we're pouring $11 Moscow
mules out of copper cups, man.

10:36.486 --> 10:38.655
I do not want to go back to Bud
Light.

10:38.689 --> 10:39.556
Todd,

10:40.824 --> 10:42.759
I am social.

10:42.793 --> 10:45.162
You know me man, I keep
the drinks pouring.

10:45.195 --> 10:47.331
All right guys, I am closing
out here.

10:47.364 --> 10:51.201
Pete is going to take care of
you for the rest of the night.

10:51.234 --> 10:53.236
Aren't you rent-controlled
anyway?

10:54.471 --> 10:55.872
Yeah, for now.

10:55.906 --> 10:57.641
All right.

10:58.508 --> 10:59.676
Hey, I can do that.

11:07.317 --> 11:09.886
- Hi Susan.
- Are you on your way home?

11:09.920 --> 11:10.955
Yeah.

11:10.989 --> 11:13.357
Ed and Karen
are coming over for dinner

11:13.390 --> 11:16.259
tomorrow night and
apparently Ed doesn't do

11:16.293 --> 11:19.563
California wines and that's
all we have in the cellar.

11:19.596 --> 11:22.599
All right, what kind do you
want?

11:22.633 --> 11:25.135
Why don't you
pick up a nice fresh zin?

11:50.293 --> 11:55.298
Hi there, can
I help you with something?

11:59.836 --> 12:01.571
You got a stain on your pants.

12:33.570 --> 12:35.238
What's up, blood?

12:38.809 --> 12:40.410
Homeboy's staring.

12:41.745 --> 12:44.448
Do the test, right there, right
there.

14:12.003 --> 14:14.704
If you call the cops,
they ain't gonna do nothing.

14:18.441 --> 14:19.676
I ain't got nothing on me.

14:21.578 --> 14:24.048
They show up and rescue
me from beating your ass,

14:24.081 --> 14:28.418
I'll find you, I never
forget a face, you hear me?

14:28.451 --> 14:31.621
You square ass "Modern
Family" looking mother fucker.

14:32.990 --> 14:34.624
Hey, you hear me?

14:48.139 --> 14:49.806
What the fuck, man?

14:50.841 --> 14:53.110
What's your fucking problem?

14:55.679 --> 14:56.613
No, no, no.

15:13.730 --> 15:15.498
Motherfucking hella bubbly,
bitch.

15:18.069 --> 15:18.935
Bam.

15:20.071 --> 15:20.937
Come on man.

15:22.505 --> 15:23.440
Are you over 21?

15:26.143 --> 15:28.912
Bitch, what you think?

15:28.945 --> 15:30.814
Yeah, I believe you.

15:31.781 --> 15:32.782
Why you celebrate?

15:37.687 --> 15:39.489
It's my lucky day.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.025
- You want box?
- No, I'm good.

15:45.729 --> 15:46.763
Excuse me.

15:46.796 --> 15:48.498
Fucking Old Navy motherfucker.

15:54.171 --> 15:58.175
Gee , that
paper from this morning.

15:58.209 --> 15:59.743
That old news by now.

15:59.776 --> 16:01.645
Yeah well, ever since I lost
my cable,

16:01.678 --> 16:03.747
that's the only entertainment I
have.

16:03.780 --> 16:05.448
It's free, take it.
Don't worry about it.

16:05.482 --> 16:07.784
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, take it.

16:07.817 --> 16:09.954
You don't have a smartphone,
huh?

16:09.987 --> 16:11.655
A smartphone? No.

16:12.656 --> 16:14.791
And I intend to keep it that
way.

16:14.824 --> 16:16.626
You have a good night Mr.
Wong, thanks for the paper.

16:16.660 --> 16:18.495
Yeah, no problem, you too.

16:42.719 --> 16:44.587
Hey dad,
sorry, I tried calling

16:44.621 --> 16:46.756
you at work but I must've just
missed you.

16:46.790 --> 16:49.659
Todd said he sent you home
early since it was slow.

16:49.693 --> 16:50.794
Anyway, just checking to make
sure

16:50.827 --> 16:54.031
you're still coming to Oakland
to see my show tomorrow.

16:54.065 --> 16:55.967
Also Sean wanted me to tell you

16:56.000 --> 16:59.036
that he thinks you should sell
Big Blue,

16:59.070 --> 17:00.704
stop driving across the damn
bridge

17:00.737 --> 17:02.639
and just move to Oakland
with the rest of us.

17:02.672 --> 17:04.008
There's a few more things we
wanted

17:04.041 --> 17:07.577
to go over for the wedding, so
call me.

17:07.610 --> 17:08.478
20, 30,

17:09.779 --> 17:10.647
50, 60,

17:11.781 --> 17:12.649
70.

17:15.319 --> 17:17.054
It was a shit night.

17:19.823 --> 17:21.993
Oh, what is he doing?

17:22.026 --> 17:24.095
Do it again, do it again.

17:54.191 --> 17:55.993
- Peter.
- Hey Ned.

17:57.194 --> 18:00.331
I thought best to tell you in
person.

18:00.364 --> 18:02.732
You're selling the building, I
heard.

18:02.766 --> 18:04.601
Actually the building's sold.

18:05.935 --> 18:06.770
Oh.

18:06.803 --> 18:10.673
So I wanted to drop by and
give you

18:10.707 --> 18:14.111
as much of a headstart as I
could.

18:14.145 --> 18:17.914
I know how hard it is to
find a new place to live.

18:17.947 --> 18:20.084
How soon are
we talking here, Ned?

18:21.218 --> 18:23.054
You got a place to go?

18:23.087 --> 18:25.022
Oh, you gotta be fucking
kidding me.

18:25.956 --> 18:28.125
No, I wish I were,
Peter.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.828
I'll have a relocation check for
you asap.

18:34.231 --> 18:36.067
Come on, baby.

18:37.268 --> 18:38.269
That a girl.

18:52.383 --> 18:56.087
♪ I'll always be there ♪

18:56.120 --> 18:58.255
♪ For you ♪

19:01.258 --> 19:03.994
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

19:05.862 --> 19:06.930
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:06.964 --> 19:09.100
we have a very special
guest in the house tonight.

19:09.133 --> 19:11.168
He's an Oakland native
and he just so happens

19:11.202 --> 19:14.038
to be my dad all the
way from San Francisco.

19:14.071 --> 19:15.973
Dad, come on up here.

19:16.006 --> 19:19.909
Sore throat.

19:19.943 --> 19:21.278
So dad.

19:23.380 --> 19:24.315
What do you want?

19:24.348 --> 19:26.217
True confession, I
had an ulterior motive

19:26.250 --> 19:28.419
for asking you to join
me on stage tonight.

19:28.452 --> 19:30.287
Not just to embarrass your
father?

19:32.089 --> 19:32.856
I'd really like it if you

19:32.889 --> 19:34.891
sang a duet with me at the
wedding.

19:35.892 --> 19:38.162
What, what are you, crazy?

19:38.195 --> 19:40.998
No, it's not crazy. It'll be
amazing.

19:41.031 --> 19:44.068
I don't know, it's 150 people.

19:44.101 --> 19:47.404
And I'll never ask for
anything from you ever again.

19:47.438 --> 19:49.006
We'll rehearse twice a week.

19:49.039 --> 19:50.441
I don't know, I haven't done

19:50.474 --> 19:54.744
anything like this in a
long time, ever since-

19:54.777 --> 19:56.180
- She would want you to do it.

20:00.917 --> 20:02.685
Ah Jesus, okay.

20:02.719 --> 20:03.387
Really?

20:03.420 --> 20:05.022
Yes, but I'm not gonna dance.

20:05.055 --> 20:05.855
Fine but you're still coming

20:05.889 --> 20:06.789
to the party tomorrow night,
right?

20:06.823 --> 20:10.027
Oh, you mean the
pre-wedding party party?

20:10.060 --> 20:11.694
Yes, that's the party.

20:11.728 --> 20:12.762
All of my friends are gonna be
there.

20:12.795 --> 20:14.431
They haven't seen you in years.

20:14.465 --> 20:16.900
I wouldn't miss it for the
world.

20:16.933 --> 20:20.271
Nice, I'm dancing like a goddamn
jabberwocky at the party.

20:20.304 --> 20:23.307
That's exactly why I'm gonna
leave the dancing to you.

20:23.340 --> 20:24.908
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

20:24.941 --> 20:26.243
To having a good time.

20:28.012 --> 20:29.779
So my offer still stands.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.948
If you want it to be a
surprise for Natalie,

20:31.982 --> 20:34.018
I could teach you to dance.

20:34.051 --> 20:36.753
For real, no look, I don't
know if you know this but

20:37.854 --> 20:40.924
you're white and so you may need
my help.

20:40.958 --> 20:42.892
I think I'll pass, okay?

20:42.926 --> 20:43.826
But hey, listen.

20:45.828 --> 20:47.264
On a more serious note,

20:47.298 --> 20:49.799
I didn't want to say
anything in front of Natalie.

20:51.001 --> 20:52.203
You're not dying, are you?

20:52.236 --> 20:54.305
Dying, what? No.

20:54.338 --> 20:57.208
Fuck no, what the fuck? No, I'm
not dying.

20:57.241 --> 20:58.808
You can't hit me with that
heavy shit.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.044
Ah shit dude, no.

21:00.077 --> 21:02.812
I saved up some money, I want
to give you guys some money.

21:02.845 --> 21:05.049
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

21:05.082 --> 21:06.950
My parents got this, bro.

21:06.984 --> 21:08.252
Natalie didn't tell you?

21:08.285 --> 21:10.521
Look okay, I know traditionally
the father

21:10.554 --> 21:14.124
- of the bride is supposed to-
- Go on.

21:15.858 --> 21:16.759
Pete.

21:16.793 --> 21:19.496
Hey look, your parents are
great, okay?

21:19.530 --> 21:22.765
It's just ever since I got
back in Natalie's life,

21:22.799 --> 21:24.235
it's been really hard to do that

21:24.268 --> 21:27.238
and I owe her so much, I owe you
so much,

21:27.271 --> 21:30.007
I'm gonna owe you when
I get older even more.

21:30.040 --> 21:32.977
No man look, we love
you bro, we love you.

21:33.010 --> 21:34.511
- Come on, man.
- I appreciate that.

21:34.545 --> 21:35.613
But I want you to take this
money

21:35.646 --> 21:38.415
and maybe use it for a
honeymoon or whatever, okay?

21:41.218 --> 21:42.453
All right.

21:42.486 --> 21:43.820
Thanks man.

21:43.853 --> 21:45.888
I really wish you still drank,
bro.

21:47.157 --> 21:48.325
- Oh no, you don't.
- What?

21:48.359 --> 21:49.960
No, you don't.

21:49.994 --> 21:51.128
I could drink you under the
table.

21:51.161 --> 21:55.199
I'm sure you could but I'm
gonna tell you right now,

21:55.232 --> 21:57.301
you don't even wanna see me try.

21:59.470 --> 22:01.138
- All right.
- Thanks, Pete.

22:11.048 --> 22:13.217
A gruesome discovery
has people in this quiet

22:13.250 --> 22:15.452
San Francisco neighborhood
feeling a bit uneasy.

22:15.486 --> 22:17.887
Are you with me?

22:17.920 --> 22:18.888
Oh, Harry.

22:18.921 --> 22:19.957
Police
were called to an alley

22:19.990 --> 22:22.559
off 40th Street at around
5:00 a.m. this morning-

22:22.593 --> 22:25.162
- Oh come on, Harry.
- Discovered a body-

22:25.195 --> 22:26.463
- Hey, you're the one that set

22:26.497 --> 22:28.599
the quota for three times a
week, not me.

22:28.632 --> 22:31.402
33 year old
Frederick Ross of Oakland.

22:31.435 --> 22:34.238
- I thought it was four?
- Help out our investigators,

22:34.271 --> 22:37.174
please do contact the San
Francisco Police Department.

22:38.575 --> 22:42.346
I know we are going through a
drought

22:42.379 --> 22:45.915
but I feel like too bad, I am
gonna take

22:45.948 --> 22:48.818
a 20 minute shower and
I don't give a shit.

22:50.321 --> 22:53.357
The environmentalists can suck
my dick.

22:53.390 --> 22:57.894
So talking about politics,
I think tomorrow the editor-

23:00.030 --> 23:01.098
- Yeah, okay.

23:14.144 --> 23:16.080
If Philip from
the Valley can't help

23:16.113 --> 23:19.216
end gun violence, I don't know
who can.

23:19.249 --> 23:21.151
We can do anything we want.

23:45.142 --> 23:48.512
I said "Of course it's
quiet, it's a fucking Tesla."

23:59.390 --> 24:02.192
This is a damn good zin.

24:04.261 --> 24:05.629
Where'd you say you got it from
again?

24:05.662 --> 24:07.264
- France.
- Yes.

24:07.297 --> 24:09.166
That's the last bottle right
there.

24:09.199 --> 24:10.401
Oh no.

24:10.434 --> 24:12.536
You're just going to have
to drink a little slower, Ed.

24:12.569 --> 24:15.038
Maybe that way you can actually
savor it.

24:18.142 --> 24:20.677
♪ Let it be the thing that I am ♪

24:20.711 --> 24:22.179
Honey.

24:23.180 --> 24:25.282
Please unplug, we have company.

24:25.315 --> 24:28.419
That's okay, that is the
society we live in now.

24:28.452 --> 24:31.688
We all have to update
our status at all times.

24:31.722 --> 24:33.724
Well, Harold
doesn't do social media.

24:33.757 --> 24:35.259
That's 'cause he's a
grownup.

24:35.292 --> 24:38.095
Shut up Ed, you have a
Facebook and a Twitter page.

24:40.597 --> 24:42.299
So why don't you do social
media?

24:45.536 --> 24:47.971
I think it brings out
the worst in humanity.

24:49.339 --> 24:50.240
How so?

24:50.274 --> 24:51.975
It makes everyone think
they're special

24:52.009 --> 24:54.445
but deep down, everyone's just a
troll.

24:56.480 --> 24:59.149
That's why people on the
internet love anonymity because

24:59.183 --> 25:02.085
they can finally feel free
to say whatever they want.

25:04.254 --> 25:05.456
- It's kinda like guns.
- Harry.

25:05.489 --> 25:09.159
Guns and trolls, wow,
this zin is incredible.

25:10.394 --> 25:12.629
It's taking us down a rabbit
hole.

25:14.765 --> 25:17.367
People don't carry guns for
protection.

25:18.635 --> 25:21.205
What they really want is for
someone

25:21.238 --> 25:23.240
to give them the excuse to use
it.

25:24.775 --> 25:28.111
Go on, burglarize my house.
Let's see what happens.

25:29.079 --> 25:30.714
Snatch my purse.

25:31.682 --> 25:33.450
You make them pay the ultimate
price

25:33.484 --> 25:35.686
just for fucking with the wrong
person.

25:36.820 --> 25:39.189
That is everyone's fantasy,
right?

25:42.593 --> 25:44.495
Tell us how you really feel,
honey.

25:46.763 --> 25:49.466
You know, I want to propose a
toast.

25:49.500 --> 25:54.471
To your Foundation from Silicon
Valley to Washington DC,

25:55.839 --> 25:57.641
sensible gun law change is
coming

25:57.674 --> 26:01.178
and it's all because of your
generosity.

26:02.479 --> 26:03.447
At the end of the day, we all

26:03.480 --> 26:06.183
just want the world to
be a safer place, right?

26:06.216 --> 26:09.419
Cheers.

26:16.260 --> 26:17.127
Sorry.

26:19.763 --> 26:20.631
Hello?

26:21.632 --> 26:23.066
Honey.

26:23.100 --> 26:24.201
Mind if I just check my phone?

26:26.303 --> 26:29.806
- I have to take this.
- Please don't be long.

26:29.840 --> 26:30.874
I am sorry.

26:30.908 --> 26:32.809
And my last
question, what is your name?

26:32.843 --> 26:36.547
Harold Price, June 23rd, 1963.

26:36.580 --> 26:37.614
And do any of the
charges

26:37.648 --> 26:39.416
look suspicious to you or
are they all occurring-

26:39.449 --> 26:41.785
- No, all of those charges are
correct.

26:41.818 --> 26:42.853
Okay, thank you sir

26:42.886 --> 26:44.187
and your other account looks
correct?

26:44.221 --> 26:45.689
- Yes, both accounts.
- Okay, great.

26:45.722 --> 26:47.157
- So nothing looks suspicious?
- No.

26:47.190 --> 26:48.525
Everything seems normal.

26:49.459 --> 26:51.562
Is there anything
else we can help you with?

26:51.595 --> 26:53.397
No thank you.

27:21.458 --> 27:24.795
Harold, come
on, we're ready to eat.

27:26.196 --> 27:27.331
Where are you?

27:29.900 --> 27:31.868
Harold, you're embarrassing me.

27:31.902 --> 27:32.736
Sweetheart, can you

27:32.769 --> 27:35.405
just apologize to Ed and Karen
for me?

27:35.439 --> 27:37.374
Is that the garage
door?

27:37.407 --> 27:39.443
Where are you going? We have
company.

27:39.476 --> 27:42.346
- I told you to be back soon.
- Honey, I'm sorry.

27:42.379 --> 27:44.448
I had to get to the office.

27:44.481 --> 27:47.351
Just please keep our guests
happy.

27:47.384 --> 27:49.386
Keep the wine flowing.

27:49.419 --> 27:51.722
What am I
supposed to do here by mys-

28:16.747 --> 28:18.181
- Credit?
- Yeah.

28:18.215 --> 28:19.816
Chip card, just
insert.

28:20.851 --> 28:21.885
You don't check ID?

28:25.957 --> 28:28.792
You have gray hair,
you're over 21 I think.

28:40.570 --> 28:41.638
Have a good night.

28:49.613 --> 28:51.648
That your security camera?

28:51.682 --> 28:52.549
Why?

28:57.354 --> 28:59.623
Where do you
keep the recordings to that?

29:42.733 --> 29:43.533
I'm Cinnamon,

29:43.567 --> 29:45.268
this is Crystal. What's your
name?

29:46.503 --> 29:47.437
Harold.

29:49.773 --> 29:52.809
- I am so fucking wasted.
- Fuck yeah, you are.

29:54.644 --> 29:56.613
- Boo yah.
- How'd you get that-

29:56.646 --> 29:58.281
- Shh.

29:58.315 --> 30:01.485
- You're so odd.
- Don't trip, baby.

30:01.518 --> 30:02.786
Harold ain't got no limits.

30:04.454 --> 30:05.422
You know what I'm saying?

30:07.390 --> 30:08.258
Come here, girl.

30:19.803 --> 30:21.239
Piece of shit.

30:32.549 --> 30:33.416
Hey box boy,

30:34.818 --> 30:37.821
how about you show me what
they charge in prison?

30:37.854 --> 30:39.790
What are you doing here?

30:39.823 --> 30:40.690
You thirsty?

30:41.691 --> 30:42.526
So a guy gets beat

30:42.559 --> 30:44.761
to death with brass knuckles, so
what?

30:46.063 --> 30:48.532
So what? Nobody uses brass
knuckles.

30:48.565 --> 30:51.568
Well, almost nobody.

30:51.601 --> 30:53.436
It doesn't mean it's the same
guy.

30:55.438 --> 30:56.406
I don't believe this.

30:56.439 --> 30:58.075
If I gave you this
information six years ago,

30:58.109 --> 30:59.943
you would've gone batshit crazy.

30:59.977 --> 31:02.612
Yeah well, two years in
prison will do that to do.

31:02.646 --> 31:03.680
Do what?

31:03.713 --> 31:05.049
Make you think twice about
doing

31:05.082 --> 31:08.085
something stupid, like listening
to you.

31:09.987 --> 31:11.922
That's not the only
thing you did in prison.

31:12.823 --> 31:14.891
You hit that commissary every
night, huh?

31:14.925 --> 31:17.828
What'd they give you, your
last meal every fucking night?

31:17.861 --> 31:18.963
Suck my dick, Jack.

31:18.996 --> 31:21.631
I know I'm a fat fuck, okay?

31:21.665 --> 31:23.000
You and Catherine still in
Petaluma?

31:23.034 --> 31:24.001
Oh yeah.

31:24.868 --> 31:26.837
God, it's great.

31:26.870 --> 31:29.606
Do you want to know what
the highlight of my day is?

31:29.639 --> 31:32.943
I wake up every morning and I
don't get

31:32.977 --> 31:35.478
a blow job from my wife and I
usually take

31:35.512 --> 31:38.515
a shit about the size of
the Transamerica Pyramid.

31:39.683 --> 31:42.452
But the highlight of my day
is I go down to my local

31:42.485 --> 31:46.723
Starbucks and I watch my
favorite barista frappe my 'cino

31:46.756 --> 31:50.927
and when she's doing it, I
just grab a little glimpse

31:51.828 --> 31:55.532
of her perfect apple ass
and then everything else

31:55.565 --> 31:58.835
goes downhill from there
because that's what fucking

31:58.869 --> 32:01.771
happens when they give you
early fucking retirement.

32:03.640 --> 32:05.609
I gotta tell ya, Pete,

32:05.642 --> 32:08.645
there's not a day that
goes by that I don't think

32:08.678 --> 32:11.481
I wonder if this is the
day I'm gonna take my Glock

32:11.514 --> 32:13.783
and blow my fucking
brains out from boredom.

32:15.987 --> 32:18.022
Jack, what are you doing here?

32:18.055 --> 32:20.124
Obviously I don't have
any money to give you.

32:20.157 --> 32:22.093
I mean you're wasting your time.

32:22.126 --> 32:23.460
Money?

32:23.493 --> 32:26.529
Pete, if I wanted money, I
wouldn't be

32:26.563 --> 32:29.466
looking for clients next
to a dumpster, no offense.

32:31.668 --> 32:33.670
I still have connections in the
LPD.

32:35.505 --> 32:36.773
What's that?

32:36.806 --> 32:39.643
That is a list of Fred
Ross' known associates.

32:40.978 --> 32:42.846
Who the fuck is Fred Ross?

32:42.879 --> 32:45.016
Who the fuck is Fred Ross?

32:45.049 --> 32:47.517
The drug dealer who got
his head bashed in with

32:47.550 --> 32:50.687
brass knuckles, now maybe
the murder was personal.

32:50.720 --> 32:52.957
Maybe someone on this
list is your guy, Pete.

32:54.091 --> 32:56.994
Why would he resurface 25
years later?

32:58.628 --> 32:59.729
Do you watch the news?

32:59.763 --> 33:01.798
Are you watching what's
happening in the world today?

33:01.831 --> 33:03.200
Everybody hates everybody, Pete.

33:03.234 --> 33:04.668
Everybody's mad about
everything.

33:04.701 --> 33:07.671
There's road rage and Twitter
wars.

33:07.704 --> 33:10.640
It's not hunky-dory like
it used to be, it's not.

33:12.909 --> 33:16.813
And beyond that, this is for
Sharry.

33:16.846 --> 33:18.581
Now you said she deserved this.

33:18.615 --> 33:21.785
This mother fucker
deserves the death penalty

33:21.818 --> 33:23.187
and we're gonna give it to him.

33:24.155 --> 33:25.622
Just like last time, huh?

33:26.756 --> 33:28.225
Okay,

33:28.259 --> 33:30.727
you accidentally sent the wrong
guy

33:30.760 --> 33:32.562
into a coma for a couple days.

33:32.595 --> 33:33.830
Five days, Jack.

33:33.863 --> 33:37.034
Five days he was in a coma but
you want to go ahead and tell

33:37.068 --> 33:40.704
yourself that so you can sleep
at night, fine, kudos to you.

33:40.737 --> 33:42.073
For me, it wasn't worth it.

33:43.873 --> 33:44.841
It got you sober.

33:45.809 --> 33:48.045
Don't give me that
silver lining bullshit.

33:52.649 --> 33:53.883
Hey,

33:53.917 --> 33:54.784
hey,

33:55.885 --> 33:58.555
Natalie's getting married in a
month.

33:58.588 --> 33:59.256
No shit.

34:00.291 --> 34:02.859
I'll bet I wasn't invited,
I'll send a toaster.

34:04.627 --> 34:06.063
I'm sorry Pete, I don't know why

34:06.097 --> 34:08.732
I'm being a fucking asshole,
especially about that.

34:09.766 --> 34:12.702
I'll bet she's beautiful
just like her mom, huh?

34:12.736 --> 34:14.972
Please give her my
congratulations all around.

34:16.573 --> 34:17.807
Yeah okay, thanks.

34:19.210 --> 34:23.147
Hey listen, you know, I
should be going anyway.

34:23.180 --> 34:24.048
Hey.

34:25.949 --> 34:28.152
Even a broken clock is right
twice a day.

34:32.922 --> 34:33.790
Pete.

34:35.658 --> 34:36.726
It wasn't your fault.

35:18.369 --> 35:23.573
♪ And you go strong and true ♪

35:25.376 --> 35:28.912
♪ Baby blue ♪

35:28.945 --> 35:30.880

35:37.955 --> 35:38.956
Good girl.

35:38.989 --> 35:42.725

35:52.702 --> 35:55.239
Thanks, I've got tapes for sale.

35:55.272 --> 35:57.607
Buy me a beer and I'll
give you a discount.

35:58.309 --> 36:01.845
This is about as dead as
I've ever seen in this place.

36:01.878 --> 36:03.314
Look at this fucking place.

36:03.347 --> 36:05.282
Next week man, better
flyers.

36:05.316 --> 36:07.151
There's not gonna be a next
week.

36:46.123 --> 36:50.027
- It's just a check.
- Just a check for 15 G's.

36:51.928 --> 36:52.963
Kicking you out, huh?

36:54.031 --> 36:55.832
Yeah.

36:55.865 --> 36:57.334
Man, like I said,
you're more

36:57.368 --> 36:59.336
than welcome to stay with
Natalie and I.

36:59.370 --> 37:00.204
They're gonna have to
drag

37:00.237 --> 37:02.072
me outta here kicking and
screaming.

37:03.374 --> 37:04.908
You know what?

37:04.941 --> 37:05.775
Maybe you should talk to Natalie

37:05.808 --> 37:08.045
before you think about moving in
with us.

37:16.487 --> 37:20.924
At first, I didn't even know
it was him.

37:20.958 --> 37:23.360
Almost nothing left of his face.

37:24.395 --> 37:27.864
As I said, it was something
metal that killed him

37:27.897 --> 37:31.168
like brass knuckles or
something like that.

37:32.503 --> 37:37.107
He lived in San Francisco
for his whole life and

37:38.942 --> 37:40.843
he work here for 40 years.

37:45.382 --> 37:46.716
Who would do this?

37:49.286 --> 37:51.522
A drug dealer, an
Asian liquor store owner.

37:51.555 --> 37:52.990
The only thing these two guys
have

37:53.023 --> 37:56.327
in common is somebody
smashed in their faces.

37:56.360 --> 37:57.962
I don't know, it might be
nothing

37:57.995 --> 37:59.896
but Mr. Wong's nephew said-

37:59.929 --> 38:02.032
- There's no security
footage at all, you know why?

38:02.066 --> 38:04.834
The son of a bitch stole
the security cameras.

38:04.867 --> 38:07.104
It's all gone. It's a
dead end for us, buddy.

38:08.005 --> 38:08.871
Thanks.

38:11.408 --> 38:12.276
Ah, fuck it.

38:34.298 --> 38:38.002
Hey Harry, can I get the email
addresses

38:38.035 --> 38:40.304
of the donors we're meeting this
weekend?

38:40.337 --> 38:43.140
I called but the guy's wife is
real judgy.

38:43.173 --> 38:46.543
You know, one of those artsy
trophy wives.

38:46.577 --> 38:49.280
- Phil?
- Yeah, Phil.

38:49.313 --> 38:51.415
She's probably bitter that she
couldn't

38:51.448 --> 38:55.286
put that $200,000 arts degree to
use.

38:55.319 --> 38:57.288
It reminds me how grateful I am

38:57.321 --> 38:59.189
that I transferred over to
marketing.

39:00.291 --> 39:02.859
You definitely dodged that
bullet.

39:17.474 --> 39:19.543
I thought you said you didn't
like anal.

39:21.979 --> 39:23.347
What are you talking about?

39:29.186 --> 39:32.489
The charges on your credit
card, Harry, I saw them.

39:33.490 --> 39:35.359
Porn and strippers, really?

39:36.360 --> 39:37.860
It was a bachelor party.

39:40.230 --> 39:41.231
Sure it was.

39:43.200 --> 39:44.601
We're starting therapy again.

39:45.569 --> 39:48.072
I'm calling Dr. Berberich
first thing in the morning.

39:48.105 --> 39:49.406
That's really not necessary.

39:49.440 --> 39:50.341
Yes, it is.

39:50.374 --> 39:52.909
You know, if I could strap a GPS

39:52.942 --> 39:54.511
to your dick, I would do that
too.

40:17.968 --> 40:20.104
How soon are you looking to
move?

40:20.137 --> 40:21.004
Soon.

40:22.039 --> 40:22.905
Yeah, real soon.

40:25.976 --> 40:28.145
So on the phone, you said it was
1650.

40:28.178 --> 40:29.680
Is there any wiggle room in
there?

40:29.713 --> 40:31.115
2650.

40:32.416 --> 40:33.083
Jesus.

40:33.117 --> 40:35.452
- What's the deposit?
- 3500.

40:38.155 --> 40:41.091
So you want 6150 to move in
here?

40:41.125 --> 40:45.129
It's a remodel, notice
the granite countertop?

40:47.097 --> 40:47.965
Yeah.

40:50.734 --> 40:52.136
I'll be in touch.

40:54.004 --> 40:55.973
- Want an application?
- Suck my dick.

41:06.717 --> 41:08.685
I would totally pick you
up but people are gonna

41:08.719 --> 41:11.321
start arriving any minute and
I'm not done cleaning yet.

41:11.355 --> 41:12.289
Sean doesn't get home 'til 5:30.

41:12.322 --> 41:14.358
Yeah no, listen, I'll just
take the bus.

41:14.391 --> 41:16.960
No, no, no, no, no,
no. That's ridiculous.

41:16.994 --> 41:18.729
I'm gonna call you an Uber.

41:18.762 --> 41:20.564
Oh honey, don't waste your
money.

41:21.598 --> 41:23.500
Too late, the driver is en
route.

41:23.534 --> 41:26.203
His name is Trevor,
he's in a silver Prius.

41:26.236 --> 41:27.438
Really, that's it?

41:27.471 --> 41:30.174
That's it, welcome to the 21st
century.

41:30.207 --> 41:31.675
I have a feeling you're gonna be
hooked.

41:38.148 --> 41:39.016
Yo.

41:46.356 --> 41:47.224
Trevor?

41:50.427 --> 41:54.598
Anyway, so here I am about
to be officially homeless.

41:55.532 --> 41:58.135
Not even Oakland is affordable
anymore.

41:58.168 --> 41:59.770
I'm gonna have to ask my
daughter

41:59.803 --> 42:02.673
if I can crash at her place for
awhile.

42:02.706 --> 42:04.508
So is that what they
call gentrification?

42:06.243 --> 42:09.346
Urban renewal, racial
dislocation.

42:09.379 --> 42:11.348
I thought that shit only
happened to black people, man.

42:11.381 --> 42:12.549
That's shit's crazy.

42:12.583 --> 42:15.385
Yeah well, my bills
don't see color apparently.

42:16.320 --> 42:18.188
- That's rough.
- What about you?

42:18.222 --> 42:19.490
What's your story?

42:20.491 --> 42:23.160
Born and raised in
Oakland just like you,

42:23.193 --> 42:26.096
except if I came up in the
public housing zone, you know?

42:26.129 --> 42:28.232
Same as any other ghetto though,
you know what I'm saying?

42:28.265 --> 42:31.668
Crime, crack, drugs,
prostitution,

42:31.702 --> 42:33.470
all out in the open and shit,
man.

42:34.538 --> 42:35.706
I was like this ain't no way to
live, man,

42:35.739 --> 42:40.077
so I got my act together, got
me a little degree online.

42:40.110 --> 42:42.145
I'm just doing this little
driving thing right now, man.

42:42.179 --> 42:45.148
You know, just trying to pay
back these student loans.

42:45.182 --> 42:46.216
I'm just grinding, man.

42:46.250 --> 42:48.051
You and me both, huh?

42:49.453 --> 42:50.320
I'll tell you,

42:51.822 --> 42:54.791
a lot of people out there
got it easy compared us.

42:54.825 --> 42:55.626
You know what I'm saying?

42:55.659 --> 42:57.394
That's one way to look at it,
man,

42:57.427 --> 43:00.097
but you know, it's about
perspective though.

43:00.130 --> 43:02.266
Remember what Teddy Roosevelt
said, right?

43:02.299 --> 43:04.067
No, what'd he say?

43:04.101 --> 43:07.170
He said "Comparison is the thief
of joy."

43:08.505 --> 43:09.373
Right?

43:11.174 --> 43:13.210
That's some motivational therapy
for you.

43:14.278 --> 43:15.479
Hey man, you ain't got nowhere
to be.

43:15.512 --> 43:16.713
I mean like right this second,
right?

43:16.747 --> 43:18.649
You mind if I pick up my
cousin right quick, man?

43:18.682 --> 43:20.751
He gonna be coming up
over here on the right.

43:22.386 --> 43:24.154
- Yeah sure, I guess.
- Right on, man.

43:24.187 --> 43:25.155
Appreciate it, man.

43:41.471 --> 43:42.472
Do you mind?

43:54.885 --> 43:56.353
Hey, hey, hey.

43:57.888 --> 44:03.093
This isn't the way.

44:03.493 --> 44:04.361
Oh shit.

44:07.564 --> 44:10.200
Target's
gonna be a black male,

44:10.233 --> 44:12.502
- 30, gray hoodie.
- Damn boy.

44:12.536 --> 44:14.204
Under a flannel.

44:14.237 --> 44:15.639
I ain't no diamond tester but

44:18.575 --> 44:20.777
to me man, that shit look
realer than a motherfucker.

44:23.513 --> 44:24.481
What the fuck you rolling around

44:24.514 --> 44:26.383
with a diamond ring in
your pocket for, Pete?

44:28.251 --> 44:30.854
It's my wife's, she's dead.

44:32.623 --> 44:35.258
She won't me missing it then,
huh?

44:36.793 --> 44:41.264
Asshole.

44:41.298 --> 44:43.500
Are you serious right
now? Everything's about you.

44:43.533 --> 44:45.636
We just went to your fucking one
man show.

44:45.669 --> 44:47.671
You don't wanna
go, you don't have to go.

44:47.704 --> 44:51.308
- No, that's not what I mean.
- No, fuck it.

44:53.276 --> 44:56.413
What are you?

44:56.446 --> 44:57.381
I thought you quit.

45:02.419 --> 45:04.287
Slow down, please.

45:04.321 --> 45:06.490
You know I hate it when
you drive like that.

45:06.523 --> 45:08.525
Get off that car's back.

45:10.527 --> 45:11.963
It's just a cigarette,
Jesus.

45:11.996 --> 45:14.331
No, it's not just a
cigarette.

45:14.364 --> 45:16.733
Why don't you just grow the fuck
up?

45:16.767 --> 45:18.702
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

45:18.735 --> 45:20.937
I don't know, behave like a
fucking man

45:20.972 --> 45:23.707
and not feel like such a
victim all the fucking time.

45:24.775 --> 45:25.876
What are you?

45:25.909 --> 45:26.777
Pete.

45:29.746 --> 45:32.449
What are you doing?

45:32.482 --> 45:34.951
Look, just take the
baby home.

45:34.986 --> 45:37.220
I am sick and tired of being

45:37.254 --> 45:39.690
strung along in your life dream.

45:42.526 --> 45:43.460
What about my life?

45:46.797 --> 45:47.664
I'm done.

45:54.738 --> 45:57.741
Man, get him the fuck up out
this car and let's roll, man.

45:59.609 --> 46:01.445
Make that nigga seasick while
you at it.

46:01.478 --> 46:06.483
Get your fat ass out the car.

46:06.750 --> 46:09.720
You ain't got no more
money tucked, do you?

46:09.753 --> 46:10.654
What's this?

46:12.489 --> 46:14.891
- Speak up, fool.
- What it looks like.

46:16.326 --> 46:18.595
- Are you a cop, Pete?
- A cop?

46:18.628 --> 46:19.529
Far from it.

46:21.032 --> 46:22.967
Cuz, check this out bro.

46:31.808 --> 46:32.709
If you ain't no cop,

46:32.743 --> 46:34.878
what you're doing with these
files, Pete?

46:34.911 --> 46:37.347
Trying to find the
guy that killed my wife.

46:38.782 --> 46:39.683
And you think one of the names
here

46:39.716 --> 46:41.885
is the person that killed your
wife, huh?

46:41.918 --> 46:42.886
Probably not.

46:44.454 --> 46:47.724
But maybe one of those guys know
who did.

46:47.758 --> 46:50.894
What if I told you I know
one of the names on here?

46:50.927 --> 46:52.997
What if I told you I
might be able to help you?

46:54.098 --> 46:55.899
I'd say you've got my
attention.

46:56.800 --> 46:58.502
Yeah, but what you got for me?

47:00.972 --> 47:01.838
Pete,

47:02.739 --> 47:03.673
come on, man.

47:05.342 --> 47:07.511
You rolling around with diamond
rings,

47:07.544 --> 47:09.746
envelopes full of cash and shit.

47:09.780 --> 47:11.548
I'm sure you got something more,
man.

47:13.483 --> 47:14.584
I got a Volvo.

47:15.619 --> 47:16.954
You know how to drive stick?

47:26.696 --> 47:29.499
This whip is perfect,
ain't it?

47:29.533 --> 47:30.400
For what?

47:32.103 --> 47:34.071
Man, when are you gonna
introduce me to your friend?

47:34.105 --> 47:35.639
Didn't I say I would do it?

47:37.641 --> 47:38.842
Let me ask you something.

47:39.943 --> 47:41.745
You ever wore glasses before,
Pete?

47:48.618 --> 47:49.287
Man, what's up, man?

47:49.319 --> 47:50.121
That nigga's truck right there.

47:50.154 --> 47:52.656
What's up with this fool Sherm,
man?

47:52.689 --> 47:54.992
I don't know, he probably
up there catching VD.

47:55.026 --> 47:58.895
I assume this Sherm is one
of the names on our list?

47:58.929 --> 47:59.997
You gonna have to season them

48:00.031 --> 48:01.832
questions a little bit more
moderately, you feel me?

48:01.865 --> 48:03.366
Sherm get in this car
and you start asking him

48:03.400 --> 48:04.501
all them questions, man, he
gonna think

48:04.534 --> 48:05.569
you some kinda narc or
something, man.

48:05.602 --> 48:06.570
He ain't gonna tell you shit.

48:06.603 --> 48:09.372
Not to mentioned it
might get you capped.

48:09.406 --> 48:10.074
And that shit's real.

48:10.107 --> 48:11.741
And what exactly is this job?

48:11.775 --> 48:13.410
Don't trip, all right?

48:13.443 --> 48:16.546
It's just some petty
larceny, that's all we doing.

48:16.580 --> 48:18.849
I'm gonna ask you to
drive the Bronco for me.

48:18.882 --> 48:21.484
Doesn't sound like part
of the original deal to me.

48:24.721 --> 48:26.790
Is this all part of the Prius
gammick too?

48:28.758 --> 48:31.528
- This music.
- What about it?

48:31.561 --> 48:35.166
It doesn't really seem
like you'd be, you know,

48:35.199 --> 48:38.468
the type of fucking guy that
would listen to shit like this.

48:38.501 --> 48:41.172
Fuck, I'll keep it 1,000 with
you, boy.

48:41.205 --> 48:42.106
What type of cars you be seeing

48:42.139 --> 48:43.975
punk ass white people driving
nowadays?

48:46.610 --> 48:49.013
Prius's, Leafs.

48:49.046 --> 48:50.480
Ever since I got this shit, man,

48:50.513 --> 48:52.149
the police ain't fucked
with a nigger, man.

48:52.183 --> 48:55.086
It's true, ever since he got
the Prius,

48:55.119 --> 48:57.754
he ain't never been stopped by
the police.

48:57.787 --> 48:59.156
Then I went like this, I
was like well fuck it, man.

48:59.190 --> 49:00.992
I'm a go all the way in, you
feel me?

49:01.025 --> 49:04.161
I got me some fucking
thick ass fucking glasses,

49:04.195 --> 49:06.596
some tiny shirts and tiny jeans,
nigga.

49:06.630 --> 49:08.732
Took this bitch, put a fucking

49:08.765 --> 49:11.768
Key Tahoe blue sticker
on the back and shit.

49:11.801 --> 49:14.105
White folks be loving
some blue ass licks.

49:14.138 --> 49:15.438
Don't they?

49:15.472 --> 49:16.374
Them mother fucks will jump off

49:16.439 --> 49:18.109
bridges on they birthday
for that bullshit.

49:18.142 --> 49:19.442
Then I was like all right nigga,

49:19.476 --> 49:21.444
I got my little outfit, you feel
me?

49:21.478 --> 49:23.180
Now a nigga needs some theme
music.

49:23.214 --> 49:25.649
So I said all right, what's the
whitest

49:25.682 --> 49:28.052
fucking music you ain't
never gonna hear some

49:28.085 --> 49:30.754
niggas from Oakland playing
when they riding around?

49:32.689 --> 49:33.690
Heavy metal, nigga.

49:34.591 --> 49:36.193
When it hit me, nigga, shit man,

49:36.227 --> 49:36.860
I started going into the
archives,

49:36.893 --> 49:38.895
like what music can I find?

49:38.929 --> 49:40.597
That's when I get my Matt
Pinfield on, you feel me?

49:40.630 --> 49:41.831
You know what was crazy?

49:43.100 --> 49:45.936
I started actually liking that
shit, bro.

49:45.970 --> 49:48.939
Like early Judas Priest
and fucking Slayer,

49:48.973 --> 49:50.807
some Black Sabbath, man.

49:50.840 --> 49:52.809
I even like some shit by White
Pride, man

49:52.842 --> 49:54.511
and I started going to their
concerts and all that shit.

49:54.544 --> 49:55.745
We went with these
little white broads, man.

49:55.779 --> 49:58.882
They took niggas down to this
fucking Lyles Rockney show.

49:58.915 --> 50:00.884
We was all in the mosh pit and
shit, boy.

50:00.917 --> 50:03.620
We were fucking stomping on
these white boys heads and shit.

50:03.653 --> 50:05.056
Mother fucker jumped up,

50:05.089 --> 50:07.757
he was like "Fuck yeah
bro, do that shit, man."

50:12.595 --> 50:15.465
I felt like I discovered
another part of myself in there.

50:18.135 --> 50:20.137
Like a spiritual part, you feel
me?

50:21.172 --> 50:22.505
That's real.

50:24.976 --> 50:25.775
You look like you're ready

50:25.809 --> 50:27.610
to take it up a notch, right
Harold?

50:28.712 --> 50:32.949
'Cause I was thinking we
could go out to my car.

50:32.984 --> 50:34.684
What, you don't know?

50:34.718 --> 50:36.153
You know, you know.

50:37.754 --> 50:42.126
Yeah, let's do it.

50:42.159 --> 50:43.027
Sherm.

50:44.594 --> 50:45.262
Shit.

50:46.297 --> 50:48.032
Yo baby, Harold's gotta roll.

50:49.200 --> 50:51.668
I've been texting
your ass for 30 minutes.

51:12.622 --> 51:13.823
Hey yo Jay, can you switch

51:13.857 --> 51:16.193
the music to something more
chill?

51:16.227 --> 51:18.561
Like Dave Matthews or something?

51:18.595 --> 51:19.997
What?

51:20.031 --> 51:22.266
Man, fuck Dave Matthews.

51:22.299 --> 51:24.301
That mother fucker be playing
eight minute solos and shit.

51:24.335 --> 51:25.668
You sitting in the stadium,

51:25.702 --> 51:27.271
your ass will fucking fall
asleep.

51:28.938 --> 51:31.608
I fucking like Dave Matthews.

51:32.809 --> 51:33.943
Do I know you?

51:35.012 --> 51:35.879
No.

51:37.248 --> 51:39.183
I feel like I've seen you
somewhere.

51:39.216 --> 51:40.683
That's the tweak, nigga.

51:41.385 --> 51:42.852
Pointillism, y'all.

51:42.886 --> 51:44.621
That's all we in it for,
pointillism.

51:44.654 --> 51:46.123
- Say what?
- Pointillism.

51:46.157 --> 51:47.091
You don't know what that is?

51:47.124 --> 51:48.993
Take an art history lesson,
nigga, damn.

51:49.893 --> 51:51.795
When we get up in this spot,

51:51.828 --> 51:53.663
don't touch shit up on this real
estate.

51:53.696 --> 51:56.100
We don't need no cash,
we don't need no jewels.

51:56.133 --> 51:57.968
All we looking for is
these two George Seurat

51:58.002 --> 52:00.371
paintings from the
French Impressionist Era.

52:00.404 --> 52:02.239
Pointillism is the style
that they credit him with

52:02.273 --> 52:04.874
that he came up with
because he would use these

52:04.908 --> 52:07.311
tiny paint dots to
create his masterpieces.

52:07.344 --> 52:09.813
He revolutionized the game, man.

52:09.846 --> 52:12.383
I thought you said this was
big, homes.

52:12.416 --> 52:14.818
It is big, fool.
Fuck you think we doing?

52:14.851 --> 52:16.753
I don't need no fucking art.

52:16.786 --> 52:17.921
I just hit the jackpot with this

52:17.955 --> 52:20.224
rich motherfucker's plastic I
stole.

52:20.257 --> 52:23.227
Got some ladies, some
mother fucking champagne.

52:23.260 --> 52:25.862
You drank it all and them
bitches ain't even here, right?

52:25.895 --> 52:28.332
See when the dollar collapses
and the Fed calls in

52:28.365 --> 52:31.368
the country's debt and quits
printing big faces, man,

52:31.402 --> 52:33.304
everybody's gonna want
to have put their money

52:33.337 --> 52:35.206
into some shit that actually
holds some value, man.

52:35.239 --> 52:39.843
Like some fine art, some land,
some water or some shit, man.

52:39.876 --> 52:43.247
Can't do no shit with no fucking
strippers and credit cards.

52:43.280 --> 52:44.881
Alright, Wall Street.

52:44.914 --> 52:46.283
As long as I get my 20%.

52:48.018 --> 52:50.920
What the fuck you keep
staring at, old man?

52:50.955 --> 52:53.424
I finally figured out
where you know me from.

52:53.457 --> 52:54.858
Oh yeah, where's that?

52:54.891 --> 52:57.627
Ross, you know me through Fred
Ross.

52:59.296 --> 53:02.066
The liquor store, that's
how I know your ass.

53:02.099 --> 53:03.400
You bumped into me at the liquor
store.

53:03.434 --> 53:05.269
- Yeah, I don't think so.
- No, it happened.

53:05.302 --> 53:07.371
Jay, how do you know
this motherfucker, man?

53:07.404 --> 53:08.705
I'm not liking this shit right
now.

53:08.738 --> 53:10.307
Nigga, shut the fuck up.

53:11.242 --> 53:13.810
This ain't no competition,
it's a cooperation, man.

53:13.843 --> 53:15.412
He the driver, that's why he
here.

53:16.447 --> 53:18.382
That's all your white ass need
to know.

53:24.321 --> 53:26.923
I'm a make it simple for you,
Pete.

53:26.957 --> 53:28.025
Text me on this phone
after you make sure that

53:28.058 --> 53:31.095
there ain't no house sitter
up in here or some shit.

53:31.128 --> 53:33.130
We gonna come through in the
Prius.

53:33.164 --> 53:36.167
We gonna come out with the
shit two minutes later.

53:36.200 --> 53:38.902
You gonna call me and slowly
drive us up to the Prius.

53:38.935 --> 53:40.937
Prez gonna be parked up like a
mile away.

53:41.838 --> 53:43.207
Then from there, you leave.

53:44.741 --> 53:47.911
We don't have no contact
for at least a week, got it?

53:47.944 --> 53:49.213
All right, I got it.

54:26.816 --> 54:28.252
Y'all got two minutes.

54:32.990 --> 54:34.824
Fuck this, I'm calling
Natalie.

54:36.126 --> 54:38.529
How the fuck do you dial on this
phone?

54:38.562 --> 54:41.398
I'm not liking this.

54:41.432 --> 54:45.868
There's somebody
breaking in on Starks.

55:09.960 --> 55:12.429
- Let's go.
- Let's fucking go, fucker.

55:12.463 --> 55:14.198
I'm trying!

55:14.231 --> 55:15.432
It won't start.

55:18.035 --> 55:19.336
Come pick us up near the car.

55:19.370 --> 55:21.305
Man, hurry up!

55:36.320 --> 55:38.522
Man, let's go, come on, come on.

55:48.365 --> 55:49.233
Fuck man.

55:51.068 --> 55:53.137
I'm bleeding out, Jay,
this look bad to you, man?

55:53.170 --> 55:53.971
I ain't no fucking doctor.

55:54.004 --> 55:55.838
How the fuck I'm supposed to
know?

55:55.872 --> 55:57.074
You gotta get me to a
hospital.

55:57.107 --> 55:58.941
Drop me off at Highland.

55:58.976 --> 56:00.210
What's the plan?

56:01.211 --> 56:03.347
The cops gonna think the
Volvo was stolen anyway.

56:03.380 --> 56:05.182
So we ain't gotta trip on that.

56:05.215 --> 56:06.916
The only thing I'm worried
about is this whip right here.

56:06.949 --> 56:08.851
You fucking hear me?

56:08.885 --> 56:09.952
We gotta get me to a hospital.

56:09.987 --> 56:11.921
Highland's 10 minutes from here.

56:11.955 --> 56:15.125
Shut the fuck up, you
trigger-happy mother fucker.

56:15.159 --> 56:16.926
We go to Highland, we all go
down.

56:19.229 --> 56:21.332
I'm a fucking kill
you when this is done.

56:22.499 --> 56:26.070
That's right, look away you
fucking bald fat piece of shit.

56:26.103 --> 56:27.404
This is all your fucking fault.

56:27.438 --> 56:30.341
Tell you what? Why don't
you fucking try it, huh?

56:30.374 --> 56:31.975
I'll fucking crack your skull
open

56:32.009 --> 56:34.244
Just like I did your
little buddy Fred Ross.

56:36.647 --> 56:39.249
- You didn't kill Fred Ross.
- The hell I didn't.

56:40.351 --> 56:42.086
Dude in the Tesla killed Ross

56:45.022 --> 56:46.090
and you ain't driving no Tesla.

56:48.925 --> 56:51.228
What?

56:51.261 --> 56:52.429
What'd you say?

56:56.567 --> 56:57.434
Sherm?

57:03.974 --> 57:06.876
I know this white boy
didn't just die in my car.

57:10.180 --> 57:11.582
That's not good.

57:26.663 --> 57:29.333
What can I get you?

57:31.034 --> 57:33.470
How long ago did my friend
Harold leave?

57:35.973 --> 57:36.640
Who?

57:41.378 --> 57:42.246
Thank you.

57:43.981 --> 57:47.985
He's been gone about 45 minutes
but he's probably out back.

57:50.387 --> 57:51.655
Which is his car?

57:54.324 --> 57:55.559
He has a Dave
Matthews

57:55.592 --> 57:57.961
sticker on the back, you can't
miss it.

58:25.522 --> 58:30.527
Code 187, Code 187.

58:31.094 --> 58:33.530
Code 187, requesting an
ambulance.

58:33.564 --> 58:36.467
All units be on the lookout
for two white males,

58:36.500 --> 58:40.003
one aged 50 to 60, the other 20
to 30.

58:40.671 --> 58:42.606
I left with that fool.

58:42.639 --> 58:44.508
Everybody up in there seen that
shit.

58:45.476 --> 58:47.678
We got a dead white
woman on our hands, man.

58:47.711 --> 58:49.313
You know what that shit means.

58:51.181 --> 58:52.683
Give me one of his cigarettes.

58:54.251 --> 58:55.185
I thought you quit.

59:04.661 --> 59:06.230
I can hide his car.

59:10.267 --> 59:11.268
What you offering?

59:14.238 --> 59:17.808
Give me my ring
back and I'll stash the car.

59:17.841 --> 59:20.277
- Where?
- I got a buddy in Petaluma.

59:20.310 --> 59:22.045
I can stash it there.

59:24.181 --> 59:25.048
We got a deal?

59:50.841 --> 59:52.075
Please pick up.

59:52.109 --> 59:54.645
Hi, you've reached
Natalie, you know the drill.

1:00:07.190 --> 1:00:09.693
Pete, what the
fuck are you wearing?

1:00:09.726 --> 1:00:11.128
I like your look.

1:00:12.462 --> 1:00:13.830
Some

1:00:13.864 --> 1:00:16.433
kind of hipster.

1:00:16.466 --> 1:00:17.801
Is that what you call that?

1:00:22.306 --> 1:00:27.377
Well then, I'm gonna take
my tea and head upstairs.

1:00:27.411 --> 1:00:28.412
Okay, hon.

1:00:29.680 --> 1:00:30.547
Goodnight.

1:00:34.418 --> 1:00:35.352
Hey Peter.

1:00:36.620 --> 1:00:38.522
You know in the course of my
career,

1:00:38.555 --> 1:00:43.393
I've been on, fuck, 5,000 crime
scenes.

1:00:43.427 --> 1:00:45.629
So little details, they're not
lost on me.

1:00:45.662 --> 1:00:47.864
Like when a guy show up at my
house

1:00:47.898 --> 1:00:49.633
with blood under his
fingernails.

1:00:53.403 --> 1:00:55.772
What the fuck are you
doing here in my house?

1:00:56.907 --> 1:00:59.743
Is there a place I
could have a cigarette?

1:00:59.776 --> 1:01:00.777
I thought you quit that too.

1:01:00.811 --> 1:01:01.878
No, you can't smoke in here.

1:01:01.912 --> 1:01:04.581
She'll have a nervous
breakdown, let's go outside.

1:01:11.655 --> 1:01:14.725
You know it's leaking oil,
right?

1:01:14.758 --> 1:01:15.826
What the hell is this?

1:01:16.860 --> 1:01:19.196
Get the hell out, look at that.

1:01:19.229 --> 1:01:21.765
Look, it's one of those tracking
devices.

1:01:22.666 --> 1:01:23.767
What's it for?

1:01:24.835 --> 1:01:26.570
Usually you see these from
some spouse

1:01:26.603 --> 1:01:27.671
think's the other one's
fucking around on 'em

1:01:27.704 --> 1:01:30.207
and they put it up under the
car.

1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:32.476
I can't imagine why a
tweaker would have it though.

1:01:32.509 --> 1:01:35.712
The cops can't use 'em,
the judges don't allow it.

1:01:35.746 --> 1:01:36.613
It's weird.

1:01:38.682 --> 1:01:39.850
Pete, what is the matter?

1:01:44.554 --> 1:01:47.658
I really fucked up. You
gotta help me out of this shit.

1:01:47.691 --> 1:01:50.594
Shh, you're gonna fucking wake
her up.

1:01:51.963 --> 1:01:57.267
Listen to me Peter, nobody
is gonna care that he's gone.

1:01:57.300 --> 1:01:59.670
Nobody, the world's a
better place without him.

1:01:59.703 --> 1:02:00.570
That said,

1:02:01.672 --> 1:02:04.408
did you get any information
before he went bye bye?

1:02:05.977 --> 1:02:09.546
He said the guy that
murdered Fred Ross was

1:02:09.579 --> 1:02:13.417
driving a Tesla, you know,
one of those electric cars.

1:02:13.450 --> 1:02:14.484
But I mean he was dying, man.

1:02:14.518 --> 1:02:15.686
He wasn't making a lot of sense.

1:02:15.719 --> 1:02:17.688
Listen to me, you called me
this morning

1:02:17.721 --> 1:02:19.623
and I called my buddies at the
Department.

1:02:19.656 --> 1:02:22.459
Would you believe that when
Wong got killed, some hipsters

1:02:22.492 --> 1:02:25.429
in the neighborhood had a
fucking drone in the air?

1:02:25.462 --> 1:02:29.700
They caught it, now they sent
me the footage from downtown.

1:02:29.733 --> 1:02:30.801
You can't see the perp's face

1:02:30.834 --> 1:02:31.969
but I'm pretty sure it's a
Tesla.

1:02:32.003 --> 1:02:34.705
Let me just go pull it up on the
computer.

1:02:34.738 --> 1:02:35.605
You know what?

1:02:36.740 --> 1:02:39.810
Trying being Superman for
awhile and not Clark Kent.

1:02:39.843 --> 1:02:41.745
Finish your cig and then come
inside.

1:03:24.921 --> 1:03:27.858
Hey dude, I got it, check this
out.

1:03:54.451 --> 1:03:55.318
Jack.

1:03:59.523 --> 1:04:01.391
Jack, what's going on?

1:05:29.479 --> 1:05:30.814
Come and find me.

1:05:59.210 --> 1:06:00.777
Why don't you go home,
man?

1:06:00.810 --> 1:06:01.811
Just sleep this one off.

1:06:02.812 --> 1:06:05.482
Why don't you give me
some good shifts, Todd?

1:06:06.483 --> 1:06:08.119
While you're at it, why don't
you give me a whiskey too

1:06:08.152 --> 1:06:11.055
or have your little social
bitch give me a bottle.

1:06:11.088 --> 1:06:13.224
What the fuck is wrong with
you, Pete?

1:06:13.257 --> 1:06:14.824
Hey, hey, let's
cut him some slack.

1:06:14.858 --> 1:06:16.793
Obviously he's had a rough day,
right?

1:06:17.827 --> 1:06:21.966
I guess the bigger they
are, the harder they fall,

1:06:21.999 --> 1:06:24.235
off the wagon, that is.

1:06:24.268 --> 1:06:25.802
Natalie, hey, it's me.

1:06:28.605 --> 1:06:30.007
Yeah, he's here.

1:06:30.041 --> 1:06:31.541
Do you mind picking him up?

1:06:39.516 --> 1:06:41.152
How long we gotta sit in here?

1:06:41.185 --> 1:06:43.988
We doing something with the
Prius?

1:06:44.021 --> 1:06:45.889
No, we'll be hiding in plain
sight.

1:06:46.958 --> 1:06:48.591
Unless you've got a better idea.

1:06:50.927 --> 1:06:53.863
Cuz, go pack your ski
clothes, we goin' to Tahoe.

1:06:58.702 --> 1:07:00.870
Where are the restrooms?

1:07:00.904 --> 1:07:02.739
This beet juice is kicking in
again.

1:07:05.608 --> 1:07:07.644
You ever had 12 ounces of beet
juice?

1:07:29.033 --> 1:07:31.868
Dad wake up, it's time to go.

1:07:31.901 --> 1:07:32.769
Pete.

1:07:34.038 --> 1:07:35.705
Natalie, Natalie.

1:07:36.706 --> 1:07:37.574
Natalie.

1:07:38.875 --> 1:07:40.910
Look what I got ya.

1:07:40.944 --> 1:07:42.512
What the fuck is
that?

1:07:45.016 --> 1:07:48.052
It's hers, I saved it for you.

1:07:51.355 --> 1:07:53.057
How drunk are you?

1:07:53.090 --> 1:07:53.958
I'm sorry.

1:07:55.592 --> 1:07:57.294
To think I was worried
about you when you

1:07:57.328 --> 1:07:59.562
didn't show up to the party,
I should have known better.

1:07:59.596 --> 1:08:01.598
Natalie, listen to me, I saw
him.

1:08:02.599 --> 1:08:04.035
You're not making any sense.

1:08:04.068 --> 1:08:05.802
The man that killed your
mother.

1:08:09.706 --> 1:08:11.908
This is what you want to go
back to?

1:08:12.977 --> 1:08:14.744
Well I'm not gonna stop you.

1:08:14.778 --> 1:08:16.313
- I'm done.
- Natalie, listen to me.

1:08:16.347 --> 1:08:19.216
I know what happened that
night.

1:08:20.217 --> 1:08:22.987
Everyone always said it was your
fault.

1:08:23.020 --> 1:08:26.923
You were the one driving the
car, not her

1:08:26.957 --> 1:08:28.792
and you left her there.

1:08:29.893 --> 1:08:32.595
She was a sitting duck
and you left her alone.

1:08:32.629 --> 1:08:33.364
You don't know what
you're talking about,

1:08:33.397 --> 1:08:35.132
so you shut the fuck up.

1:08:37.968 --> 1:08:39.903
Don't pretend this
whole sober charade you've

1:08:39.936 --> 1:08:42.839
been putting on for the last
six years erases any of that.

1:08:46.643 --> 1:08:47.978
And don't come to my wedding.

1:09:04.095 --> 1:09:05.963
Hey, do you have a
cigarette I can bum off you?

1:09:05.996 --> 1:09:08.999
- Sorry, this is my last one.
- I got a fresh pack.

1:09:14.071 --> 1:09:14.938
Thank you.

1:09:16.340 --> 1:09:17.208
Here you go.

1:09:20.411 --> 1:09:21.878
You really shouldn't smoke.

1:09:23.314 --> 1:09:24.181
It's dangerous.

1:09:38.195 --> 1:09:40.064
Pete, where's Natalie, man?

1:09:40.097 --> 1:09:41.198
I've been trying to get
ahold of her, where is she?

1:09:41.232 --> 1:09:42.099
Oh Sean,

1:09:43.334 --> 1:09:44.701
oh man.

1:09:44.734 --> 1:09:45.668
It's 5:00 in the morning,

1:09:45.702 --> 1:09:47.737
Pete but tell me where Natalie
is, please.

1:09:47.770 --> 1:09:49.073
I've been trying to look
for her, where is she?

1:09:49.106 --> 1:09:51.774
She got mad at me and she left
the bar.

1:10:00.050 --> 1:10:00.917
Shit, man.

1:10:02.386 --> 1:10:03.820
I gotta go, man.

1:10:03.853 --> 1:10:04.721
Oh shit.

1:10:06.056 --> 1:10:07.992
We gotta call the cops.

1:10:15.765 --> 1:10:17.334
What the fuck is this guy
doing?

1:10:20.337 --> 1:10:21.205
Shit.

1:10:23.940 --> 1:10:26.709
It's fine Natalie, don't worry.

1:10:26.743 --> 1:10:28.078
Mommy's got this.

1:10:29.180 --> 1:10:31.081
Everything's just fine.

1:10:39.889 --> 1:10:44.894
Shit.

1:10:57.474 --> 1:11:02.479
Sharry, really, what
the fuck?

1:11:03.514 --> 1:11:05.349
And the baby's alone.

1:11:06.317 --> 1:11:10.487
Great, I need to put
the fucker down, right?

1:11:10.521 --> 1:11:12.189
Sharry?

1:11:12.223 --> 1:11:13.090
Sharry?

1:11:13.991 --> 1:11:14.857
Sharry?

1:12:00.170 --> 1:12:01.771
Man, wake your ass up.

1:12:03.007 --> 1:12:04.475
Where am I?

1:12:04.508 --> 1:12:06.977
Don't worry about where
the fuck you at, boy.

1:12:07.011 --> 1:12:08.145
Originally I was gonna leave

1:12:08.178 --> 1:12:11.415
your fat ass down the road
somewhere, slumped, nigger.

1:12:11.448 --> 1:12:13.050
It's your lucky day, Pete.

1:12:13.083 --> 1:12:15.918
'Cause of you, I got me a good
luck charm.

1:12:15.952 --> 1:12:19.023
A motherfucking black card,
endless flow of credit.

1:12:20.124 --> 1:12:21.158
It's not really a good time

1:12:21.191 --> 1:12:22.925
for me to be taking a road trip.

1:12:23.594 --> 1:12:26.196
Mother fucker, this
ain't no fucking road trip.

1:12:29.199 --> 1:12:30.434
Put that shit on.

1:12:30.467 --> 1:12:32.469
You gonna help us rob this
Harold Price.

1:12:33.604 --> 1:12:36.040
Not getting my ass shot for your
dumb ass.

1:12:36.939 --> 1:12:39.576
Part-owner of some big ass
companies.

1:12:39.610 --> 1:12:41.944
I'll tell you, Harold Price got
so much motherfucking money,

1:12:41.979 --> 1:12:43.547
he don't even know what to do
with it.

1:12:43.580 --> 1:12:45.182
Nigga got more money than God.

1:12:46.050 --> 1:12:49.919
That's why he got a place
in Maui, LA, New York

1:12:49.952 --> 1:12:52.289
and this lakefront property
right here in Tahoe.

1:13:01.498 --> 1:13:03.833
Do you know Steph Curry?

1:13:05.602 --> 1:13:06.470
No.

1:13:07.638 --> 1:13:09.106
Do you know Steph Curry?

1:13:11.608 --> 1:13:12.476
No.

1:13:13.644 --> 1:13:17.014
But aren't you guys
professional basketball players?

1:13:22.453 --> 1:13:23.886
Lacrosse.

1:13:32.663 --> 1:13:34.498
You fucking kidding me right
now?

1:13:34.531 --> 1:13:37.134
I don't need no art,
I just hit the jackpot

1:13:37.167 --> 1:13:40.237
with this rich mother
fucker's plastic I stole.

1:13:40.270 --> 1:13:42.639
Got me some ladies, some
motherfucking champagne.

1:13:43.574 --> 1:13:44.742
I got me a good luck
charm.

1:13:44.775 --> 1:13:48.479
As I said, there was something
metal like brass knuckles.

1:13:48.512 --> 1:13:51.281
Killed Fred Ross was driving a
Tesla.

1:13:52.416 --> 1:13:55.285
I saw the man that
killed that your mother-

1:13:59.189 --> 1:14:01.225
- Mother fucker look like
he just seen a ghost.

1:14:04.027 --> 1:14:05.529
Let's just get this over with.

1:14:26.116 --> 1:14:29.186
Hell yeah, I'm feeling
good about this one, boy.

1:14:29.219 --> 1:14:31.622
- There's no cars there.
- What about the garage?

1:14:33.323 --> 1:14:35.459
Okay, let me see.

1:14:39.596 --> 1:14:40.697
Come on, nigga.

1:14:40.731 --> 1:14:42.065
This ain't no time for no flying
lesson.

1:14:42.099 --> 1:14:43.267
I thought you knew how to work
this shit.

1:14:43.300 --> 1:14:45.402
It won't let me fly over
the property for some reason.

1:14:45.436 --> 1:14:47.438
Didn't you say this drone
had range of over a mile?

1:14:47.471 --> 1:14:49.406
It does but it won't
let me.

1:14:59.416 --> 1:15:00.250
Hon?

1:15:01.518 --> 1:15:03.287
What? I'm getting
ready.

1:15:06.523 --> 1:15:08.292
You want to go to Tahoe
instead?

1:15:10.527 --> 1:15:12.129
- Damn.
- Ooh, boy.

1:15:15.232 --> 1:15:17.267
You sure they're gone for the
weekend?

1:15:17.301 --> 1:15:18.535
Hell yeah, the website said

1:15:18.569 --> 1:15:21.505
they had a fundraiser in
DC all weekend, we good.

1:15:21.538 --> 1:15:25.476
Damn, them white folks weren't
lying.

1:15:25.509 --> 1:15:27.377
This lake is blue as fuck.

1:15:28.779 --> 1:15:32.483
We have a fundraiser with
Karen and Ed in DC, remember?

1:15:32.516 --> 1:15:34.751
Something more important came
up.

1:15:34.785 --> 1:15:36.320
What?

1:15:36.353 --> 1:15:37.554
You.

1:15:37.588 --> 1:15:39.356
What is this for?

1:15:39.389 --> 1:15:41.258
Happy early anniversary, baby.

1:15:49.766 --> 1:15:51.101
I am gonna go pack.

1:16:05.115 --> 1:16:07.384
Hey Pete, you good?

1:16:07.417 --> 1:16:09.152
Keep doing your thing, man.

1:16:09.186 --> 1:16:10.687
You're our white alibi this
trip.

1:16:15.158 --> 1:16:16.493
I don't trust your ass, man.

1:16:19.696 --> 1:16:21.465
So we gonna bounce or
what?

1:16:21.498 --> 1:16:23.567
Might as well, we ain't
got shit else to do here.

1:16:25.202 --> 1:16:26.069
Hold on.

1:16:26.803 --> 1:16:28.038
Is that a hot tub?

1:16:33.710 --> 1:16:34.578
White people.

1:16:37.714 --> 1:16:41.184
You mean rich white
people, don't get it twisted.

1:16:42.586 --> 1:16:44.721
Man, I could get used
to living like this.

1:16:48.191 --> 1:16:49.726
What you mean,
used to living like what?

1:16:50.694 --> 1:16:53.063
Living like
white people, you know?

1:16:53.730 --> 1:16:57.467
Wine tasting, going in a hot air
balloon.

1:16:58.402 --> 1:16:59.469
Shit like that, man.

1:17:03.540 --> 1:17:04.441
You can do all that shit, man.

1:17:04.474 --> 1:17:06.209
You ain't gotta be white to do
that shit.

1:17:07.311 --> 1:17:08.779
Just look at Pete, man.

1:17:08.812 --> 1:17:09.613
The shit he's told you about his
life.

1:17:09.646 --> 1:17:11.348
The shit he going through right
now.

1:17:12.649 --> 1:17:16.219
You think he got hot air balloons,
spa treatments every day?

1:17:19.489 --> 1:17:20.424
He ain't got shit.

1:18:09.539 --> 1:18:10.407
Oh shit.

1:18:11.508 --> 1:18:12.376
Oh no.

1:18:14.811 --> 1:18:15.679
Prez?

1:18:16.613 --> 1:18:17.481
Prez?

1:18:21.518 --> 1:18:23.186
I guess you didn't

1:18:23.220 --> 1:18:24.488
need to bring your golf clubs
after all.

1:18:25.555 --> 1:18:27.524
Prez, Prez, pull your shit up.

1:18:27.557 --> 1:18:29.326
Come on nigga, they home.

1:18:31.628 --> 1:18:34.231
Look at that,
why are all the lights on?

1:18:34.264 --> 1:18:35.165
Might be part of the
new

1:18:35.198 --> 1:18:37.334
security system they installed
yesterday.

1:18:39.971 --> 1:18:40.837
Prez.

1:18:45.742 --> 1:18:47.511
Come on, they home.

1:18:57.954 --> 1:19:00.323
Holy shit,

1:19:00.357 --> 1:19:01.758
the paintings.

1:19:01.792 --> 1:19:03.560
Harold, we've been robbed.

1:19:03.593 --> 1:19:05.562
- We sure have.
- Harold.

1:19:14.838 --> 1:19:16.873
Come on, what are you stopping
for?

1:19:16.907 --> 1:19:17.741
Man, come on.

1:19:18.942 --> 1:19:20.343
I'm staying here.

1:19:24.414 --> 1:19:25.816
Why don't you go upstairs,

1:19:25.849 --> 1:19:28.385
see if your jewelry's still
here.

1:19:28.418 --> 1:19:30.253
Do you think they took my
jewelry?

1:19:30.988 --> 1:19:33.356
And if they did, we'll replace
that too.

1:19:34.357 --> 1:19:37.527
Sweetheart, while you're up
there, why don't you freshen up?

1:19:38.929 --> 1:19:41.598
We're not gonna let this
ruin our romantic weekend.

1:19:44.601 --> 1:19:46.470
I just feel so fucking
violated.

1:20:26.676 --> 1:20:28.512
Oh shit.

1:20:39.090 --> 1:20:40.524
Where's your shirt?

1:20:40.557 --> 1:20:42.226
That sink exploded on
me.

1:20:46.097 --> 1:20:47.397
What was that noise?

1:20:48.632 --> 1:20:51.701
It was air in the pipes in
that bathroom, it's horrible.

1:20:55.705 --> 1:20:56.706
It's all gone.

1:20:57.707 --> 1:21:00.577
My pearls, diamonds, everything.

1:21:03.080 --> 1:21:06.716
Something tells me we're
gonna get them back real soon.

1:21:06.750 --> 1:21:09.686
I know, I know it can
be replaced, it's just

1:21:12.589 --> 1:21:15.725
do you think the thieves
are still around here?

1:21:15.759 --> 1:21:19.030
No, no one would hang around.

1:21:36.646 --> 1:21:38.682
Come on, keys, keys.

1:21:38.715 --> 1:21:40.917
Shit man, I must've left 'em
inside.

1:21:44.554 --> 1:21:47.457
I'm gonna
put a roast in the oven

1:21:47.490 --> 1:21:49.392
and in a couple hours we're
gonna have

1:21:49.426 --> 1:21:52.029
a nice meal and we're
gonna shake all this off.

1:21:52.896 --> 1:21:55.398
Why don't you take a nice hot
shower?

1:22:08.478 --> 1:22:11.048
What the fuck is wrong with
you?

1:22:11.082 --> 1:22:13.150
It's him.

1:22:13.184 --> 1:22:14.618
He killed my wife.

1:22:16.820 --> 1:22:17.921
He killed my daughter.

1:22:20.590 --> 1:22:22.926
Pete, you knew this shit
the whole goddamn time

1:22:22.960 --> 1:22:24.527
and you didn't fucking say
nothing?

1:22:24.561 --> 1:22:26.630
I oughta kill your ass my
goddamn self.

1:22:26.663 --> 1:22:29.499
You led us straight to
the goddamn devil's lair.

1:22:29.532 --> 1:22:30.934
No, you led us here.

1:22:33.204 --> 1:22:37.108
Listen man, it's two against
one.

1:22:37.141 --> 1:22:38.675
We in this shit together now.

1:23:06.270 --> 1:23:08.838
Hey listen, you distract 'em.

1:23:10.607 --> 1:23:12.609
I'm gonna go get my gun.

1:23:24.956 --> 1:23:26.589
They must be upstairs.

1:24:05.628 --> 1:24:06.763
- Sherman?
- No.

1:24:14.138 --> 1:24:17.074
- Where's Sherman?
- Pete, he's down here!

1:25:03.020 --> 1:25:05.755
I hope you enjoyed yourself on
my dime.

1:25:19.970 --> 1:25:22.705
- Get out.
- Oh my god.

1:25:22.739 --> 1:25:23.606
Get out.

1:25:25.142 --> 1:25:26.676
Where'd that ring come from?

1:25:29.646 --> 1:25:31.614
My husband gave it to me.

1:25:31.648 --> 1:25:33.217
You can have it.

1:25:33.250 --> 1:25:34.151
Did he kill her?

1:25:36.253 --> 1:25:37.154
- What?
- My daughter,

1:25:37.188 --> 1:25:38.888
did he kill her?

1:25:38.922 --> 1:25:39.889
There must be some kind of
mistake.

1:25:39.923 --> 1:25:43.726
My husband, he's just
a venture capitalist.

1:26:02.346 --> 1:26:04.814
Is it everything
you imagined, Pete?

1:26:06.317 --> 1:26:08.185
Harry, you know him?

1:26:08.219 --> 1:26:10.221
He's just
looking for his daughter.

1:26:10.254 --> 1:26:13.224
Please tell him you
don't know where she is.

1:26:13.257 --> 1:26:14.024
Where's Natalie?

1:26:15.392 --> 1:26:17.294
Well you're her dad, you tell
me.

1:26:18.295 --> 1:26:19.263
Fuck you.

1:26:20.864 --> 1:26:22.166
You took that ring from her.

1:26:23.367 --> 1:26:27.037
No, she gave that to me at
that bar where you work at.

1:26:28.272 --> 1:26:30.773
She traded it actually for a
cigarette.

1:26:33.410 --> 1:26:37.081
Don't you fucking lie to me,
Natalie would never do that.

1:26:39.782 --> 1:26:42.186
Sometimes people just
need a shoulder to cry on

1:26:43.420 --> 1:26:45.222
and she certainly never had
yours.

1:26:45.256 --> 1:26:47.790
What the fuck are you
talking about, Harold?

1:26:48.758 --> 1:26:49.692
Will you tell him the truth?

1:26:49.726 --> 1:26:52.929
Tell him that you don't know
where she is.

1:26:52.963 --> 1:26:54.431
Should I tell him that I don't
know

1:26:54.465 --> 1:26:57.368
where she is or should
I tell him the truth?

1:26:57.401 --> 1:26:59.170
After all, it was you who was
driving

1:26:59.203 --> 1:27:03.073
the car that night, wasn't it,
macho man?

1:27:05.509 --> 1:27:07.178
Yeah, that's who you are.

1:27:13.783 --> 1:27:15.319
You ever put on a pair of these?

1:27:17.154 --> 1:27:19.190
Nevermind, I can tell the
answer's no.

1:27:20.958 --> 1:27:23.826
You'd a been real proud of
Natalie.

1:27:23.860 --> 1:27:25.695
She was a very tough girl.

1:27:26.829 --> 1:27:29.166
She didn't scream nearly
as much as her mom did.

1:27:46.317 --> 1:27:49.886
29 years and it all comes down
to that.

1:27:53.390 --> 1:27:54.924
How does that make you feel?

1:27:56.460 --> 1:27:57.428
Deflated?

1:27:59.330 --> 1:28:01.764
You should have taken my advice,
Pete.

1:28:03.900 --> 1:28:07.371
You crossed a line that
now cannot be uncrossed.

1:28:45.142 --> 1:28:46.010
Here.

1:28:48.945 --> 1:28:51.148
Hello?

1:28:51.181 --> 1:28:52.449
Hello?

1:28:52.483 --> 1:28:57.454
Just some fucking blocked number,
probably another robocall.

1:28:58.188 --> 1:28:59.990
You killed my wife

1:29:00.024 --> 1:29:02.892
for something that happened 30
years ago.

1:29:02.925 --> 1:29:04.927
That makes you worse than me.

1:29:05.862 --> 1:29:08.032
Nobody deserves what you did.

1:29:08.065 --> 1:29:08.931
Sure,

1:29:10.134 --> 1:29:12.303
but I gave your wife the chance

1:29:12.336 --> 1:29:17.274
to apologize for your bad
behavior and it just didn't take.

1:29:17.308 --> 1:29:20.477
Now your daughter on the other
hand, now she is talented.

1:29:22.079 --> 1:29:24.814
I'm going to invest in her
singing career.

1:29:25.482 --> 1:29:27.484
I'm gonna be her first big
break.

1:29:48.972 --> 1:29:52.409
When I was a kid,
my mama had this dog,

1:29:52.443 --> 1:29:54.545
it was a little poodle named
Sammy.

1:29:54.578 --> 1:29:55.979
She loved that dog, right?

1:29:57.181 --> 1:29:59.049
He used to do all kind a tricks
like

1:29:59.083 --> 1:30:01.618
walk on his hind legs,
spin around in circles.

1:30:01.652 --> 1:30:03.987
You know, all that cute
little poodle shit.

1:30:05.522 --> 1:30:07.024
Then one day my mama was walking
him

1:30:07.057 --> 1:30:08.525
and she ran into this pit bull.

1:30:09.460 --> 1:30:12.296
It looked mean but she gave
it the benefit of the doubt

1:30:12.329 --> 1:30:15.399
and she put her hand out to
pet it and it growled at her.

1:30:16.633 --> 1:30:19.303
Well little Sammy,

1:30:19.336 --> 1:30:20.537
he wanted to protect her from
that pit.

1:30:20.571 --> 1:30:23.173
So he started barking
at it and that was all

1:30:23.207 --> 1:30:25.376
it took for that pit to put
little Sammy on his back,

1:30:25.409 --> 1:30:27.478
wrap his jaw around his neck and
kill him.

1:30:29.012 --> 1:30:30.647
Mama didn't do nothing about it.

1:30:30.681 --> 1:30:32.882
She thought maybe it was Sammy's
fault.

1:30:33.550 --> 1:30:34.951
He shouldn't have barked.

1:30:36.053 --> 1:30:37.954
Is this it?

1:30:37.988 --> 1:30:40.324
Yeah, that's him right there.

1:30:44.061 --> 1:30:45.562
Hey man, you're the
groom?

1:30:47.131 --> 1:30:48.132
Congratulations.

1:30:57.141 --> 1:30:59.576
One day my neighbor's
pit bull came up missing.

1:31:03.013 --> 1:31:05.948
We came out front, calling his
name,

1:31:05.983 --> 1:31:06.949
yelling down the street.

1:31:10.454 --> 1:31:13.424
Everybody was so concerned
about this pit bull

1:31:13.457 --> 1:31:15.459
not 'cause they felt bad for the
neighbor

1:31:16.560 --> 1:31:18.061
but really they didn't
want that dog wreaking

1:31:18.095 --> 1:31:21.632
any more havoc on anybody
in the neighborhood.

1:32:31.635 --> 1:32:34.171
What they didn't know is I had
to put that dog down myself.
