WEBVTT

00:08.875 --> 00:10.875
Cha-chung!

00:18.333 --> 00:20.958
-The Eagle shall lead them all.

00:21.875 --> 00:24.083
Every kingdom heeds her call.

00:24.166 --> 00:26.833
-And so it begins,

00:26.916 --> 00:28.666
and finally ends,

00:28.750 --> 00:31.625
the story of our beloved friends.

00:31.708 --> 00:34.416
Oh, I worry we interfered too much.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.125
Perhaps we made it worse
for these children.

00:37.208 --> 00:38.125
Hmm…

00:38.208 --> 00:40.125
What is done is done.

00:40.208 --> 00:43.666
It was and shall always be their choice.

00:44.750 --> 00:49.583
They grow,
they flower, they end.

01:03.583 --> 01:05.041
If it is to be…

01:05.125 --> 01:06.916
It is up to me!

01:29.958 --> 01:32.166
-Get away from my daughter!

01:32.250 --> 01:34.666
-Mi amor.

01:34.750 --> 01:36.916
-After everything I've done for you…

01:37.000 --> 01:38.750
…how could you betray me?

01:38.833 --> 01:41.750
I forgave you after your betrayal.

01:41.833 --> 01:43.208
Does that mean nothing?

01:51.750 --> 01:53.625
No!

01:54.958 --> 01:58.916
-But, mi amor, I… I love you.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.291
If you love me,

02:00.375 --> 02:02.500
-end all of this right now.

02:03.083 --> 02:05.041
Please, I beg you.

02:05.625 --> 02:06.458
For me.

02:06.958 --> 02:08.291
Por nosotros.

02:10.125 --> 02:12.083
-No. No.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.916
-No. Enough.

02:15.583 --> 02:16.875
I am the god of…

02:16.958 --> 02:19.291
-…war!

02:21.500 --> 02:23.333
And the world of mortals

02:23.416 --> 02:26.083
-shall pay for its insolence.

02:26.166 --> 02:28.083
-Not today!

02:29.791 --> 02:32.458
What are you waiting for? Attack!

02:33.958 --> 02:36.500
-We're gonna kill you!
-Till you're dead.

02:36.583 --> 02:39.416
-Catch!

02:39.500 --> 02:41.250
Remember me?

02:44.625 --> 02:46.083
-Huh?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.333
Huh?

02:48.708 --> 02:51.000
-Hey, bat hombre,

02:51.083 --> 02:53.583
good job getting
Picchu's people to fight beside us.

02:53.666 --> 02:56.041
Well, barbarians can be stubborn.

02:56.125 --> 02:58.625
-That princess almost bit me.

02:58.708 --> 02:59.583
I like her.

02:59.666 --> 03:01.208
-Yeah, you would.

03:01.291 --> 03:03.041
-Wait, what?

03:05.083 --> 03:06.708
I let her know I was taken.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.083
You two are adorbs.

03:14.250 --> 03:16.000
-Kill Eagle girl!

03:16.708 --> 03:17.833
-Oh!

03:17.916 --> 03:19.000
-Ah!

03:20.000 --> 03:21.833
-Not bad.

03:21.916 --> 03:23.708
-Not bad at all.

03:23.791 --> 03:26.791
-Burn, you imbeciles. Burn!

03:26.875 --> 03:29.583
-Agh!
-We answer to a higher power.

03:45.666 --> 03:48.083
Magic dragon punch!

03:48.166 --> 03:50.000
Punch! Punch!

03:50.083 --> 03:51.083
Punch!

04:01.708 --> 04:05.625
-I really hate you all.

04:05.708 --> 04:08.541
You idiots wanna fight me
one by one or all at once?

04:08.625 --> 04:12.666
Talking skeleton bad at math.

04:12.750 --> 04:16.083
Yes, Father. The odds are in our favor.

04:16.666 --> 04:19.625
While not always understand you,

04:19.708 --> 04:22.500
-always proud of you.

04:24.166 --> 04:26.750
-I love you, Papa.
-Aww.

04:26.833 --> 04:29.250
What is happening?

04:29.333 --> 04:30.833
On my command…

04:30.916 --> 04:34.416
…smash this skeleton demon
into dust!

04:34.500 --> 04:37.750
That my little girl.

04:37.833 --> 04:40.666
-Barbarian Pumas!

04:40.750 --> 04:42.875
-Wait. Hold on!

04:42.958 --> 04:45.125
For Picchu!

04:45.208 --> 04:46.625
Barbarians!

04:51.916 --> 04:53.875
-Steady, my warriors.

04:55.250 --> 04:58.625
-Please, don't hurt me.

05:11.875 --> 05:13.000
Ready…

05:18.916 --> 05:20.000
Aim…

05:21.083 --> 05:24.208
-Mijita, I mised you so much.

05:24.291 --> 05:27.333
-¿Papi? I've missed you too.

05:27.833 --> 05:31.583
We can make a pact with Lord Mictlan.

05:31.666 --> 05:34.750
And the world shall know the might…

05:37.791 --> 05:39.583
Please, daughter.

05:41.666 --> 05:45.208
That is exactly what my father would do.

05:45.291 --> 05:46.541
Ooh.

05:47.583 --> 05:50.291
But I am not my father. Fire!

05:51.458 --> 05:53.083
Curse you, escuincla.

05:56.708 --> 06:00.541
-We are so going to win this battle.
-Hurry, children. Con cuidado.

06:00.625 --> 06:02.250
How are Maya and her allies doing?

06:02.333 --> 06:04.916
-She seems to be doing just fine.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.166
-You can do it!

06:11.708 --> 06:13.375
What?

06:22.208 --> 06:24.625
-Had enough, niña tonta?

06:24.708 --> 06:26.750
-We can do this all day.

06:26.833 --> 06:27.791
And all night.

06:27.875 --> 06:30.125
-Wait, what?
-I might need to pee soon.

06:31.791 --> 06:33.791
-Seriously, I need to pee.

06:33.875 --> 06:35.541
-Now, Chimi!

06:35.625 --> 06:37.708
-Get him, Rico!

06:43.750 --> 06:45.333
Good shot, muchachos!

06:45.416 --> 06:46.958
Huh?

06:47.041 --> 06:50.166
-I just about had enough of you.

06:50.250 --> 06:53.125
Give up now!
You're completely outnumbered.

06:53.208 --> 06:57.333
Girl, did you really think
I wouldn't bring my own army?

06:57.416 --> 07:01.250
-This day ends with your sacrifice.

07:09.458 --> 07:11.541
That cannot be good.

07:16.333 --> 07:19.166
-Well, it was nice knowing you guys.

07:19.250 --> 07:21.000
-¡Ay, caramba!

07:30.666 --> 07:34.041
-Behold my unholy army.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.333
I'm afraid to say it,
but could this get any worse?

07:40.416 --> 07:41.500
Rico!

07:52.791 --> 07:57.000
-Watch and learn, peasant boy.

08:01.125 --> 08:02.458
I'm sorry.

08:11.166 --> 08:12.958
Together, we can triumph!

08:13.041 --> 08:15.583
-We are all the true prophecy.

08:15.666 --> 08:18.458
All four kingdoms, fighting as one.

08:18.541 --> 08:21.250
Each finger is weak, but together…

08:21.333 --> 08:23.625
We are a mighty fist.

08:23.708 --> 08:29.083
And today, the sun will cheer
our victory over evil!

08:32.000 --> 08:36.291
Crush these cockroaches
and bring me that Teca princess, now!

08:37.833 --> 08:40.416
-Charge!

08:42.041 --> 08:45.875
-Show them the might of the Jungle Lands!

08:47.250 --> 08:49.250
Barbarians!

08:50.791 --> 08:52.375
-Ribbit!

08:55.166 --> 08:57.041
Aim for their heads! I'll aim--

08:57.125 --> 08:59.250
-Mi amor!
-¿Mi amor?

09:02.791 --> 09:03.750
Gran Bruja!

09:03.833 --> 09:05.125
Go, Rico. Help her.

09:05.208 --> 09:06.708
-I'll cover you.

09:06.791 --> 09:08.208
You better not die, Rico!

09:09.375 --> 09:11.833
-Because I think I love you.
-Aww.

09:13.708 --> 09:15.375
You shut your snouts right now.

09:18.333 --> 09:20.541
There's too many
of those things, mi amor.

09:20.625 --> 09:23.083
-I fear the tide is turning.

09:23.166 --> 09:24.458
You stay.

09:24.541 --> 09:26.541
I… I can join the battle.

09:26.625 --> 09:29.125
Very well. Go help Maya.

09:29.208 --> 09:31.916
As you wish.

09:34.166 --> 09:36.000
-Make me proud, gordo.

09:36.083 --> 09:37.875
For Teca!

09:38.583 --> 09:40.833
-Hold on, Maya!

09:41.333 --> 09:43.666
-Here come the reinforcements!

09:46.291 --> 09:48.750
-Taste my claw!

09:51.791 --> 09:52.750
Get the healers.

09:54.333 --> 09:55.625
Now!

09:55.708 --> 09:57.750
-I got this one, Chimi!

09:58.875 --> 10:02.250
-Rico!
-I don't got this!

10:05.000 --> 10:06.791
Ta-da!

10:06.875 --> 10:09.000
Ay, gallito.

10:09.083 --> 10:10.875
-Rico, look out!

10:10.958 --> 10:13.500
-Thank you, Chimi!

10:14.541 --> 10:17.208
Man, I think I love that girl.

10:18.333 --> 10:20.791
Your leg!

10:20.875 --> 10:24.000
-Stop. Stop! No crutch. Not anymore.

10:24.083 --> 10:25.750
-I know. I know. I know.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.916
But I promised the G-- G-- G-- Gran Brujo…

10:29.000 --> 10:30.791
-…I'd protect his daughter.

10:30.875 --> 10:32.708
She needs you more than me now.

10:33.750 --> 10:36.375
-Gracias, Estefan.

10:37.958 --> 10:39.083
Hola, old friend.

10:40.333 --> 10:42.208
-Gracias, Rico.

10:44.250 --> 10:47.916
I'm not going to make it.

10:49.041 --> 10:50.750
Calma. Calma.

10:51.333 --> 10:52.166
I got this.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.166
Huh?

10:59.250 --> 11:01.791
-What are you doing?

11:01.875 --> 11:03.541
-Peasant Magic?!

11:16.375 --> 11:19.958
But how did you learn
to control the Peasant Magic?

11:20.041 --> 11:20.958
I didn't.

11:21.041 --> 11:23.791
-I just go with the flow.

11:23.875 --> 11:25.791
Aren't-- Aren't you afraid?

11:25.875 --> 11:27.416
It's okay to be afraid.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.708
What others call my…

11:28.791 --> 11:30.666
…weaknesses,

11:30.750 --> 11:32.541
they are my strengths.

11:32.625 --> 11:35.041
I never should have doubted you.

11:38.500 --> 11:41.708
-Unleash your power, gallito.

11:41.791 --> 11:44.375
-I don't know if I can hold it.

11:46.083 --> 11:49.083
-Ancient amigos gigantes!

11:50.083 --> 11:52.250
Go forth y luchen…

11:52.333 --> 11:53.333
You got this!

11:53.916 --> 11:55.333
…triunfantes!

12:00.291 --> 12:03.791
-Ancient amigos gigantes!

12:04.791 --> 12:08.666
-Go forth y luchen triunfantes!

12:24.791 --> 12:26.333
It cannot be.

12:34.833 --> 12:35.833
-Yay!

12:41.541 --> 12:43.208
I love you, man.

12:43.291 --> 12:44.666
You got this, Rico!

12:44.750 --> 12:45.875
That's my human!

12:45.958 --> 12:46.916
You know it.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.333
By my father's beard, you really are
the greatest wizard who ever lived!

12:51.416 --> 12:52.458
Ooh-hoo!

12:52.541 --> 12:53.958
Come and get some, baby!

12:57.208 --> 13:02.250
Behold the might of the prophecy!

13:04.041 --> 13:05.958
I didn't know Rico could do that.

13:07.625 --> 13:09.625
-We end this now!

13:11.000 --> 13:12.541
-Maya!

13:14.500 --> 13:15.666
-Die!
-Oh!

13:18.041 --> 13:19.916
Get away from my daughter!

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
You two-faced son of a motherless goat.

13:27.250 --> 13:32.125
-You will have to go through us.

13:34.250 --> 13:36.125
-Hey, Maya.

13:36.208 --> 13:40.000
-Guys, this is my father.

13:40.083 --> 13:43.541
-Papa, this is Cipactli and Cabrakan.

13:43.625 --> 13:46.125
Your daughter Maya saved our marriage.

13:46.208 --> 13:48.583
With the help of the god of counseling.

13:48.666 --> 13:50.583
We will fight for her cause.

13:54.416 --> 13:55.666
And yours, Lady Micte.

13:57.166 --> 14:00.125
-Now that's a big one.

14:00.208 --> 14:02.458
Just like I like 'em.

14:02.541 --> 14:05.125
-Try to keep up, husband!

14:05.208 --> 14:08.208
-She gets more lovely every day.

14:09.375 --> 14:11.500
Who wants to play ball?

14:12.541 --> 14:14.250
I love those guys.

14:14.333 --> 14:17.041
My king. You are needed
in the pyramid with the queen.

14:17.125 --> 14:19.625
We'll keep fighting down here. Go to Mama.

14:19.708 --> 14:22.291
-I'm coming, mi amor!

14:33.041 --> 14:34.791
-Chimi! Are you all right?

14:35.375 --> 14:36.791
-Vucub!

14:36.875 --> 14:39.166
-What did he do to you?

14:39.250 --> 14:42.416
Mictlan said your human lies
have blinded me,

14:42.500 --> 14:45.291
so he took my eyes.

14:47.250 --> 14:50.875
-Vucub, god of the Jungle Land animals…

14:50.958 --> 14:54.125
…I beg your forgiveness
for the sins of mi familia.

14:54.750 --> 14:56.916
Your heart is true, young queen.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.041
-I accept your apology.

15:00.125 --> 15:02.500
-Vucub, we need all the help we can get.

15:02.583 --> 15:04.375
I cannot see, Chimi.

15:04.916 --> 15:07.708
With your permission,
Vucub, I can be your eyes.

15:07.791 --> 15:11.166
Animals and humans together,
as it was meant to be.

15:13.666 --> 15:18.208
-Yes. For you, Chimi, I will fight!

15:24.375 --> 15:26.333
-Vucub, you're so amazing.
-Ooh!

15:32.791 --> 15:34.875
-Let's get to it, then.

15:34.958 --> 15:37.250
-Will you join us, Chimi?

15:40.875 --> 15:42.583
Head west to the sunlight.

15:42.666 --> 15:44.958
This is
the best day of my life.

15:48.666 --> 15:51.666
You go, Chimi, go!

16:01.166 --> 16:02.625
Push, my queen.

16:02.708 --> 16:04.208
The baby is here!

16:05.750 --> 16:09.625
-Whoa! Mi amor, is everything all right?

16:10.208 --> 16:12.416
Oh yeah. Everything is just…

16:12.500 --> 16:15.250
-…great!

16:16.666 --> 16:17.500
Huh?!

16:17.583 --> 16:21.375
-She's so… beautiful.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.958
-Like you.

16:25.041 --> 16:27.208
Another baby?

16:27.291 --> 16:29.166
Twins?

16:29.250 --> 16:31.583
This is all your…

16:31.666 --> 16:34.541
-…fault!

16:36.375 --> 16:39.541
-You will never rule both realms!

16:40.125 --> 16:43.500
-Ha! Big words from an armless fool.

16:43.583 --> 16:45.833
-Do your worst.

16:47.125 --> 16:48.125
Cabrakan!

16:48.208 --> 16:50.791
-No!

16:58.500 --> 17:00.375
-Adios, mi amor.

17:02.416 --> 17:04.625
-You will pay for this!
-Hmm.

17:06.750 --> 17:10.041
-I will avenge you, Cabrakan!

17:10.125 --> 17:12.250
-Join your husband.

17:13.750 --> 17:17.250
-Oh yes, till death do you part, lovers.

17:18.375 --> 17:20.250
-No!

17:20.750 --> 17:22.166
-Cipactli!

17:29.458 --> 17:31.666
-They are winning the battle.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.875
It is time
to end this foolishness.

17:36.416 --> 17:38.833
-Summon my gods.
-Yes, my lord.

17:38.916 --> 17:41.291
-That's a thing you can do?

17:41.375 --> 17:43.041
I never knew you could do that.

17:44.250 --> 17:46.791
-My pantheon of gods,

17:46.875 --> 17:49.500
I thank you all for your service.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.708
Your sacrifice will never be forgotten.

17:56.375 --> 17:59.541
-Even me, my lord?

18:00.041 --> 18:01.750
-Huh?

18:01.833 --> 18:05.166
I shall honor you all.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.333
-Ay!

18:10.458 --> 18:12.666
-Die!

18:18.250 --> 18:20.416
-You monster!

18:20.500 --> 18:23.041
Huh? This is on you, woman!

18:23.125 --> 18:24.125
Stop him!

18:26.333 --> 18:29.083
-Salud, amigos!

18:30.791 --> 18:31.625
-No!

18:38.416 --> 18:39.750
Oh no. We're too late!

18:39.833 --> 18:41.583
Worship…

18:41.666 --> 18:44.000
-…me!

18:55.708 --> 18:57.000
Did he just die?

18:57.083 --> 19:01.625
-Wait, this is a good thing, right?
-No. No, no, no, no. It is so not good.

19:01.708 --> 19:04.416
-Um, why does it feel like something…

19:04.500 --> 19:07.166
-Really bad is about…
-To happen.

19:17.375 --> 19:20.333
Oh no. We need to evacuate the children.

19:23.083 --> 19:24.833
-Mama! Papa!

19:24.916 --> 19:27.375
Shh! You'll wake the babies.

19:28.458 --> 19:29.791
Teca twins?

19:29.875 --> 19:31.250
-Oy!

19:31.333 --> 19:34.208
Praise the celestials.
They're so perfect!

19:37.166 --> 19:40.208
-Mija, how's the battle going?

19:40.291 --> 19:41.583
Uh…

19:43.500 --> 19:45.833
-What is that?

19:45.916 --> 19:47.291
Lord Mictlan is coming.

19:47.375 --> 19:49.500
In his final form.

19:49.583 --> 19:50.541
-Ah!

19:58.416 --> 19:59.291
Oh my gods.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.083
-Ah!

20:21.291 --> 20:23.458
What now?

20:43.541 --> 20:45.916
Well, that's not too bad.

20:50.750 --> 20:51.916
Rico!

20:52.000 --> 20:53.958
I mean, it could be worse.

20:57.958 --> 20:59.583
I've got to keep my mouth shut.

21:04.125 --> 21:06.666
This fight
ain't done just yet.

21:06.750 --> 21:10.500
Behold the power of Luna Island!

21:18.375 --> 21:20.208
How do we kill this monster?

21:20.291 --> 21:23.791
-As a human child of death herself,

21:23.875 --> 21:28.041
it is your gift and your curse, Maya.

21:28.125 --> 21:30.625
I am so sorry.

21:31.208 --> 21:32.291
Don't be sorry.

21:32.833 --> 21:36.708
All of this has been an amazing adventure.

21:36.791 --> 21:39.416
Thank you for giving me life.

21:40.416 --> 21:42.291
Thank you for your strength.

21:42.958 --> 21:45.458
And thank you for your love.

21:52.916 --> 21:53.958
Hey.

21:54.041 --> 21:55.333
If it is to be…

21:55.416 --> 21:57.125
It is up to me.

22:02.375 --> 22:03.750
-All right.

22:03.833 --> 22:06.416
-I'm gonna kill the god of war.

22:13.208 --> 22:14.458
Thank you, my wizard.

22:24.416 --> 22:25.833
-Zatz…

22:25.916 --> 22:28.958
-…you and Lady Mic-- my mother,

22:29.041 --> 22:31.875
fight them in the air
and lure them down so I can get inside.

22:31.958 --> 22:33.833
Maya.

22:33.916 --> 22:35.916
Just trust me.

22:41.166 --> 22:42.541
Be well, Princess Maya.

22:46.750 --> 22:47.958
I'll see you soon.

22:52.166 --> 22:54.208
-Good luck!

22:54.958 --> 22:56.375
Mi príncipe.

22:56.458 --> 22:59.000
-Why didn't he do that sooner?

23:08.416 --> 23:10.833
Chimi, you three shoot
at the serpent's eyes.

23:10.916 --> 23:13.208
Understood. Good luck, Maya.

23:13.291 --> 23:15.916
Gracias, Chimi. I love you, hermana.

23:20.750 --> 23:23.708
Rico, keep the golems
attacking it from below.

23:23.791 --> 23:26.083
You got it, Eagle Warrior.

23:26.958 --> 23:28.625
I love you so much, hermano.

23:29.916 --> 23:32.958
-Rooster Wizard!

23:33.041 --> 23:36.125
Papa, you and Mama
protect the children in the library.

23:36.208 --> 23:39.500
-You two take care of Mama y Papa, okay?

23:44.125 --> 23:47.541
I will show Mictlan
the glory of the Tecas, Papa.

23:47.625 --> 23:50.750
-I have no doubt of that, mija.

23:51.583 --> 23:52.666
My Little Eagle.

23:53.916 --> 23:56.708
Mama, you were right about everything.

23:58.666 --> 24:03.208
My warrior diplomat,
your glory will outshine us all.

24:03.291 --> 24:04.291
I love you, mija.

24:04.875 --> 24:06.500
I love you more, Mama.

24:09.583 --> 24:11.958
Chiapa and I will lead the serpents away.

24:12.041 --> 24:14.583
-May the celestials be with us.

24:14.666 --> 24:16.458
Good luck, Maya.

24:18.916 --> 24:20.291
Hey, Mictlan!

24:20.375 --> 24:23.250
-You want me? Come and get me.

24:31.375 --> 24:34.416
-I am the wrath of Teca!

24:36.791 --> 24:38.958
-Get away from them!

24:43.041 --> 24:44.166
Oh no, you don't!

24:46.333 --> 24:49.750
-Mi rooster grande y fuerte, wake up!

24:50.291 --> 24:52.541
-Dale y no pares…

24:52.625 --> 24:54.333
-…and let's shake things up!

24:54.416 --> 24:57.000
-Vamos, super rooster, vamos!

25:09.125 --> 25:12.833
-Tadow! How you like me now?

25:17.583 --> 25:19.083
He is the chosen one.

25:19.625 --> 25:21.250
Boom shaka laka!

25:25.666 --> 25:27.666
-Hold on, Chiapa!

25:32.708 --> 25:33.791
-Mama!

25:33.875 --> 25:35.708
-Papa! No!

25:37.458 --> 25:39.041
For Teca!

25:45.041 --> 25:47.541
-Taste my claw!

25:47.625 --> 25:49.500
For Teca!

25:51.708 --> 25:54.750
-Los niños, get them out of the way!

25:57.833 --> 25:58.791
Husband, no!

25:58.875 --> 26:00.083
Everyone, take cover!

26:00.166 --> 26:02.416
-For Teca!

26:05.500 --> 26:08.500
-Get out!

26:08.583 --> 26:10.625
You did it, Rico!

26:11.333 --> 26:13.250
Was there ever any doubt?

26:24.666 --> 26:26.666
Mama! No!

26:37.250 --> 26:39.000
-We have to help her.

26:39.583 --> 26:40.458
-Mama!

26:40.541 --> 26:42.083
-Come on, Chiapa.

27:00.833 --> 27:04.333
-Chimi! Blind that monster!

27:06.958 --> 27:08.125
Nice shot, Chimi!

27:13.375 --> 27:15.000
-We have to save him!

27:22.500 --> 27:23.500
Zatz!

27:27.000 --> 27:29.750
-I love you, Maya.

27:32.583 --> 27:35.125
-No!

27:43.083 --> 27:47.000
-No, no, no. No! No!

27:48.416 --> 27:50.291
This cannot be.

27:51.791 --> 27:54.166
-I love you, Zatz.

27:54.250 --> 27:56.875
-Oh…
-Mama!

28:00.875 --> 28:03.541
-Mama! Mama, no.

28:03.625 --> 28:04.666
Not you too.

28:05.791 --> 28:08.666
Maya, listen to me.

28:09.375 --> 28:12.375
Make his sacrifice count.

28:16.750 --> 28:18.291
What is that?

28:18.375 --> 28:19.666
His venom.

28:20.250 --> 28:22.958
Mi niña, I'm at peace.

28:23.041 --> 28:25.958
Death comes for all of us,

28:26.041 --> 28:28.666
even for death herself.

28:28.750 --> 28:31.208
No. Hold on, Mama. Por favor.

28:31.291 --> 28:36.375
I'm so glad I got to see you grow

28:37.666 --> 28:38.875
and shine.

28:39.458 --> 28:42.666
-Mama, don't go.

28:42.750 --> 28:45.958
-Up, left, right!

28:48.416 --> 28:49.291
Rico!

28:51.583 --> 28:54.875
-I got you, Rooster Wizard.
-Gracias, Gran Bruja. Oh no.

28:54.958 --> 28:56.166
-Look out, Chimi!

29:02.375 --> 29:04.458
-Be well, my ladies.

29:04.958 --> 29:08.625
-Die, Mictlan. Die!

29:09.791 --> 29:11.666
-No!
-Vucub!

29:19.458 --> 29:22.208
-All is lost, man!

29:28.125 --> 29:32.125
-Lord Mictlan, tyrant of the underworld,

29:32.208 --> 29:36.125
murderer of my friends, my family…

29:36.208 --> 29:37.750
…and my love…

29:38.625 --> 29:43.250
-I, Princess Maya of the Teca,

29:44.083 --> 29:47.500
challenge you to a battle…

29:47.583 --> 29:49.000
…to the death!

30:08.750 --> 30:12.750
Rise up, rise up, piedras grandes!

30:12.833 --> 30:16.083
Help our Mighty Eagle be triunfante!

30:16.625 --> 30:18.250
Go, Maya, go!

30:19.875 --> 30:22.125
-Thank you, Rooster Wizard!

30:31.041 --> 30:32.208
You're up, mi amor.

30:32.291 --> 30:33.708
I get it.

30:42.666 --> 30:46.083
Hey! Left eye, Skull Warrior!

30:46.166 --> 30:48.083
This one's for you, Maya!

31:16.333 --> 31:17.333
-Show him--

31:17.416 --> 31:18.291
What glory--

31:18.375 --> 31:19.500
-Really means!

31:21.666 --> 31:24.416
-Barbarians!

31:24.500 --> 31:25.416
Picchu?

31:26.041 --> 31:27.541
-Gracias, Puma Warriors!

31:54.125 --> 31:55.125
-Oh!

31:55.208 --> 31:56.791
That poor girl.

31:56.875 --> 31:58.375
-Maya!

31:58.458 --> 32:03.083
I… I am the wrath of Teca!

32:08.708 --> 32:11.708
El corazón

32:14.000 --> 32:18.083
-I am the Eagle Warrior!

32:29.083 --> 32:35.000
I… am… the Eagle… Warrior.

32:39.041 --> 32:43.500
I… am the Eagle…

32:43.583 --> 32:45.166
…Warrior.

33:06.333 --> 33:07.166
No.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.125
-Not-- Not yet.

33:14.833 --> 33:17.416
…it is up to me!

33:43.541 --> 33:45.250
Ay, no…

33:45.333 --> 33:48.666
-Maya.

33:49.375 --> 33:50.458
You did it.

34:05.416 --> 34:06.708
Maya!

34:06.791 --> 34:12.208
At that moment, I finally realized
that glory is not about winning,

34:12.291 --> 34:14.958
-but about saving the ones you love.

34:17.416 --> 34:20.916
Lord Mictlan was right
about my sacrifice changing everything.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.416
But it was, from the start,
my sacrifice to make.

34:26.083 --> 34:27.416
Mictlan buried us.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.750
-But he didn't know--
-We were seeds.

34:38.250 --> 34:41.000
Most impressive, my princess.

34:41.083 --> 34:44.833
In the end,
the Teca prophecy turned out to be true.

34:45.416 --> 34:48.250
But not in the way any of us expected.

34:48.333 --> 34:54.083
All the kingdoms worked together
and saved the world of gods and mortals.

34:54.166 --> 34:56.583
G-- G-- G… Gran Brujo.

34:56.666 --> 34:58.666
With a Magic Rooster…

34:58.750 --> 35:03.666
I see you finally embraced
what was always in you.

35:03.750 --> 35:06.875
Thanks to your…
b-- b-- belief in me, Gran Brujo.

35:06.958 --> 35:08.375
Estefan helped too.

35:08.458 --> 35:11.000
Petite femme, I'm so proud.

35:11.083 --> 35:12.583
Oh, papi!

35:12.666 --> 35:15.583
-Now that's a grand entrance.

35:15.666 --> 35:18.375
-Ay…

35:18.458 --> 35:20.875
-A True Skull…
-My dear Chimi,

35:20.958 --> 35:23.333
-there is someone I want you to meet.

35:25.125 --> 35:25.958
Mama?

35:28.166 --> 35:31.500
I am so sorry
I was not there for you, mi niña.

35:32.333 --> 35:36.958
No. I am so sorry
my birth took your life, Mama.

35:37.041 --> 35:37.875
Ay…

35:37.958 --> 35:42.458
I would die again a thousand times
for you to live, Chimi.

35:53.208 --> 35:54.125
Huh?

35:54.208 --> 35:55.375
Monkey?

35:55.458 --> 35:57.500
-Monkey!

36:02.833 --> 36:04.166
A Brave Puma…

36:05.541 --> 36:07.416
Thank you all for your help.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.708
-A noble warrior's death.

36:11.791 --> 36:14.166
Well, you raised me right, Papa.

36:14.250 --> 36:17.083
I am so proud of you, mi niño héroe.

36:17.833 --> 36:23.083
A sacrifice for love
seems to run in this family, mi amor.

36:23.166 --> 36:24.958
Come here, mi niño.

36:25.041 --> 36:26.375
Ay, Mama.

36:26.458 --> 36:29.666
You're so handsome, like your papa!

36:31.750 --> 36:34.875
-And finally, a Mighty Eagle.

36:34.958 --> 36:37.583
Hermanos, I want you to meet
the Teca baby twins.

36:37.666 --> 36:39.041
-They--
-Are--

36:39.125 --> 36:41.083
So cute!

36:41.166 --> 36:44.041
May all the gods bless them.

36:44.125 --> 36:45.666
Oh…

36:45.750 --> 36:47.375
What are their names, Mama?

36:47.458 --> 36:49.833
-The boy is named Jaguar.

36:49.916 --> 36:53.666
-And the girl will be named Eagle.

36:53.750 --> 36:54.958
After you, Maya.

36:59.958 --> 37:03.291
And just when our legend
could not get any more glorious…

37:06.583 --> 37:09.166
-They grow…
-They flower…

37:09.250 --> 37:10.500
They end…

37:11.208 --> 37:13.958
And they triumph.

37:49.000 --> 37:54.166
Because of my sacrifice,
the celestials, in all their wisdom,

37:54.250 --> 37:56.041
granted me the greatest of honors.

37:58.583 --> 38:01.250
-Bravo, mija!

38:04.041 --> 38:07.083
-I became the sun.

38:08.875 --> 38:10.041
And my true love?

38:12.625 --> 38:16.958
-Well, he became the moon.

38:18.833 --> 38:22.875
We get to dance together
forever and ever.

38:28.958 --> 38:30.291
Ay, gordo.

38:30.375 --> 38:34.541
-And every day, at dusk and dawn…

38:34.625 --> 38:37.250
…we all get to see each other.

38:39.500 --> 38:40.500
Look, kids.

38:40.583 --> 38:42.750
-Es su tia.

38:54.250 --> 38:55.708
Adios, Maya.
