'Whenever
I get gloomy...

01:14.098 --> 01:15.426
with the state of the world,

01:15.526 --> 01:17.456
'I think about the
arrivals gate...

01:17.556 --> 01:18.638
at Heathrow airport.

01:18.738 --> 01:20.181
'General opinion makes out...

01:20.281 --> 01:22.600
that we live in a world
of hatred and greed...

01:22.700 --> 01:24.394
'but I don't see that.

01:24.494 --> 01:27.021
'Seems to me that
love is everywhere.

01:27.121 --> 01:29.483
'Often it's not
particularly dignified...

01:29.583 --> 01:31.651
or newsworthy but
it's always there.

01:31.751 --> 01:34.168
'Fathers and sons,
mothers and daughters,

01:34.268 --> 01:35.362
husbands and wives,

'boyfriends, girlfriends,
old friends.

'When the planes
hit the Twin Towers,

01:40.717 --> 01:43.102
'none of the phone
calls from people on...

01:43.202 --> 01:45.414
board were messages
of hate or revenge,

01:45.514 --> 01:47.791
'they were all
messages of love.

01:47.891 --> 01:51.874
'if you look for it, I've
got a sneaky feeling...

01:51.974 --> 01:55.884
you'll find that love
actually is all around. '

02:09.329 --> 02:12.623
I feel it in my fingers

02:12.707 --> 02:15.876
I feel it in my toes

02:15.960 --> 02:20.506
Feel it in my toes, yeah

02:20.589 --> 02:25.136
Love is all around me
And so the...

02:26.319 --> 02:28.080
I'm afraid you did
it again, Bill.

02:28.180 --> 02:31.206
It's just I
know the old version...

02:31.306 --> 02:32.543
so well, you know.

02:32.643 --> 02:34.895
Well, we all do.

02:34.979 --> 02:37.340
That's why we're making
the new version.

02:37.440 --> 02:39.133
Right, OK, let's go.

02:42.236 --> 02:45.990
I feel it in my fingers
In my fingers

02:46.073 --> 02:49.201
I feel it in my toes

02:49.285 --> 02:53.705
Feel it in my toes, yeah

02:53.788 --> 02:56.332
Love is all ar...

02:56.416 --> 03:00.666
Oh, fuck, wank, bugger,
shitting arsehead and hole.

03:02.255 --> 03:04.382
Start again.

03:09.179 --> 03:12.724
I feel it in my fingers
In my fingers

03:12.807 --> 03:15.769
I feel it in my toes

03:15.852 --> 03:20.523
Feel it in my toes, yeah

03:20.607 --> 03:24.110
Christmas is all around me
All around me

03:24.194 --> 03:27.364
And so the feeling grows

03:27.447 --> 03:31.910
So the feeling grows

03:31.993 --> 03:35.454
It's written in the wind
In the wind

03:35.537 --> 03:38.207
It's everywhere I go

03:38.248 --> 03:42.961
Everywhere I go

03:43.045 --> 03:45.512
So if you really
love Christmas

03:45.612 --> 03:46.699
Love Christmas

03:46.799 --> 03:49.385
Come on and let it snow

03:49.468 --> 03:51.470
Come on and let it...

03:51.553 --> 03:53.806
This is shit, isn't it?

03:53.889 --> 03:56.558
Yep, solid gold
shit, maestro.

04:20.581 --> 04:21.581
God, I'm so late.

04:21.680 --> 04:24.277
It's just round the
corner, you'll make it.

04:24.377 --> 04:27.614
You sure you don't mind
me going without you?

04:27.714 --> 04:30.074
No, really. I'm just
feeling so rotten.

04:30.174 --> 04:32.844
I love you.
- I know.

04:32.927 --> 04:35.468
I love you even
when you're sick...

04:35.568 --> 04:36.998
and look disgusting.

04:37.098 --> 04:40.585
I know. Now, go or you
will actually miss it.

04:40.685 --> 04:42.685
Right.

04:45.273 --> 04:47.859
Did I mention
that I love you?

04:47.959 --> 04:50.458
Yes, you did. Get out, loser.

05:07.044 --> 05:09.838
Karen, it's me again.

05:09.921 --> 05:12.778
I'm sorry, I literally
don't have...

05:12.878 --> 05:14.918
anybody else to talk to.

05:15.343 --> 05:17.401
Absolutely. Horrible
moment, though.

05:17.501 --> 05:18.622
Can I call you back?

05:18.722 --> 05:20.165
Of course.

05:20.265 --> 05:22.662
Doesn't mean I'm not
terribly concerned...

05:22.762 --> 05:24.169
that your wife just died.

05:24.269 --> 05:26.438
Understood.

05:26.521 --> 05:29.071
Er, bugger off, call me later.

05:32.651 --> 05:34.303
So what's this big news?

05:34.403 --> 05:37.056
We've been given our parts
in the nativity play...

05:37.156 --> 05:38.933
and I'm the lobster.

05:39.033 --> 05:40.685
The lobster?
- Yeah.

05:40.785 --> 05:44.622
In the nativity play?
- Yeah. First Lobster.

05:44.705 --> 05:46.807
There was more than
one lobster present...

05:46.907 --> 05:47.984
at the birth of Jesus?

05:48.084 --> 05:50.086
Duh.

05:54.632 --> 05:56.927
Best sandwiches in Britain.

05:58.177 --> 06:00.429
Try my lovely nuts?

06:02.848 --> 06:06.078
Beautiful muffin for
a beautiful lady.

06:08.813 --> 06:10.981
Morning, my future wife.

06:29.582 --> 06:31.526
OK, you can
stop there. Thanks.

06:31.626 --> 06:33.987
I need a
couple of orange gels.

06:34.087 --> 06:36.048
By the way, he
introduced me as John...

06:36.148 --> 06:37.490
but everyone calls me Jack.

06:37.590 --> 06:40.635
Oh, fine. Nice to
meet you, Jack.

06:40.719 --> 06:42.829
He got me right,
though. I'm just Judy.

06:42.929 --> 06:45.432
Great, Just Judy...

06:50.478 --> 06:53.230
No surprises?
- No surprises.

06:53.313 --> 06:56.800
Not like the stag night?
- Unlike the stag night.

06:56.900 --> 06:59.412
You admit the prostitutes
were a mistake?

06:59.512 --> 07:00.512
I do.

07:00.612 --> 07:02.306
And it would've
been much better...

07:02.406 --> 07:04.099
if they'd not turned
out to be men?

07:04.199 --> 07:06.243
That is true.

07:08.620 --> 07:10.748
Good luck, kiddo.

07:33.895 --> 07:37.635
Prime
Minister, over here...

07:48.117 --> 07:50.161
Thank you.

07:51.704 --> 07:53.668
Welcome, Prime Minister.

07:53.768 --> 07:56.148
Woh. I must work
on my wave.

07:56.167 --> 07:58.167
How are you?

07:58.211 --> 08:00.363
How are you feeling?
- Erm...

08:00.463 --> 08:02.632
Cool. Powerful.

08:02.715 --> 08:05.368
Would you like to meet
your household staff?

08:05.468 --> 08:08.121
Yes, I would like that
very much indeed.

08:08.221 --> 08:09.931
Anything to put off...

08:10.031 --> 08:12.495
actually running
the country.

08:12.933 --> 08:14.777
This is Terence.
He's in charge.

08:14.877 --> 08:15.877
Morning, sir.

08:15.977 --> 08:16.729
Good morning.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.630
I had an uncle
called Terence.

08:18.730 --> 08:20.770
Hated him, I think
he was a pervert.

08:20.870 --> 08:22.968
But I very much like
the look of you.

08:23.068 --> 08:25.195
This is Pat.
- Hello, Pat.

08:25.278 --> 08:27.764
Good morning, sir.
I'm the housekeeper.

08:27.864 --> 08:30.434
Oh, right. I should be
easier than the last lot.

08:30.534 --> 08:33.352
No nappies, no teenagers,
no scary wife.

08:33.453 --> 08:36.273
And this is Natalie.
She's new, like you.

08:36.373 --> 08:40.085
Hello, Natalie.
- Hello, David. I mean, sir.

08:40.168 --> 08:42.446
Shit, I can't believe
I've just said that.

08:42.546 --> 08:44.625
And now I've gone
and said 'shit'.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.241
Twice. I'm so sorry, sir.

08:46.341 --> 08:47.755
You could've said 'fuck'...

08:47.855 --> 08:49.703
and we'd have been
in real trouble.

08:49.803 --> 08:52.499
Thank you, sir. I
had a premonition

08:52.599 --> 08:55.374
I was gonna fuck up
on my first day.

08:55.474 --> 08:58.269
Oh, piss it.

08:58.352 --> 09:00.225
Right, I'll get my things...

09:00.325 --> 09:03.090
and then let's fix
the country, shall we?

09:03.190 --> 09:05.400
Yeah, I can't see why not.

09:18.080 --> 09:20.691
It's all right.
- Did you see what I did?

09:20.791 --> 09:22.818
Yes, I did.
- I just went 'blurh'.

09:22.918 --> 09:25.196
Hello there.
- I'm right over here.

09:25.296 --> 09:28.632
Yeah, I'm in here.
OK. Good. Thank you.

09:28.716 --> 09:30.716
Ah.

09:34.846 --> 09:37.098
Oh, no.

09:37.182 --> 09:39.351
That is so inconvenient.

09:42.812 --> 09:43.959
In the presence of God,

09:44.059 --> 09:46.299
Peter and Juliet have
given their consent...

09:46.399 --> 09:48.091
and made their
marriage vows...

09:48.191 --> 09:48.927
to each other.

09:49.027 --> 09:50.808
They've declared
their marriage...

09:50.908 --> 09:52.097
by the giving of rings.

09:52.197 --> 09:53.993
I therefore proclaim...

09:54.093 --> 09:56.728
that they are
husband and wife.

10:02.082 --> 10:03.197
And you resisted...

10:03.297 --> 10:05.026
the temptation
for surprises.

10:05.126 --> 10:07.253
Yeah, I'm mature now.

10:16.929 --> 10:19.973
Love, love, love

10:21.600 --> 10:25.020
Love, love, love...

10:26.271 --> 10:28.507
Love, love, love...
- Did you do this?

10:28.607 --> 10:31.610
Er, no.

10:31.694 --> 10:35.906
Love, love, love, love

10:38.575 --> 10:40.894
There's nothing you can do
that can't be done

10:40.994 --> 10:43.038
Oh, it...

10:43.122 --> 10:45.357
There's nothing
you can sing...

10:45.457 --> 10:46.734
that can't be sung

10:46.834 --> 10:48.617
There's nothing
you can say...

10:48.717 --> 10:50.988
but you can learn
how to play the game

10:51.088 --> 10:54.590
It's easy

10:55.883 --> 10:58.261
All you need is love

11:00.596 --> 11:03.141
All you need is love

11:05.685 --> 11:09.814
All you need is love, love

11:10.773 --> 11:13.192
Love is all you need...

11:15.403 --> 11:17.822
Look, it's Pikey.

11:28.833 --> 11:31.653
Hello. What the hell
are you doing here?

11:31.753 --> 11:34.613
Oh, I just popped over
to borrow some old CDs.

11:34.713 --> 11:36.516
The lady of the house
let you in, did she?

11:36.616 --> 11:37.616
Yeah.

11:37.716 --> 11:41.094
Lovely, obliging girl.
- Yeah.

11:41.178 --> 11:42.845
I thought I'd pop
back and see...

11:42.945 --> 11:44.456
if she's better. This is good.

11:44.556 --> 11:45.556
Oh.

11:45.656 --> 11:48.894
Listen, erm, I've
been thinking.

11:48.977 --> 11:51.048
I think we ought to
take Mum out for...

11:51.148 --> 11:53.382
her birthday on Friday.
What do you think?

11:53.482 --> 11:55.948
I just feel we've been
bad sons this year.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.095
Sounds fine. A bit
boring but fine.

11:58.195 --> 12:00.138
Hurry up, big boy.

12:00.238 --> 12:03.593
I'm naked and I want
you at least twice...

12:03.693 --> 12:05.693
before Jamie gets home.

12:14.835 --> 12:17.725
I am so
happy to see you.

12:18.422 --> 12:21.482
Delicious delicacy?
- Er, no, thanks.

12:26.764 --> 12:29.016
Taste explosion?

12:41.112 --> 12:43.197
Food?
- No, thanks.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.308
Yeah, a bit dodgy, isn't it?

12:45.408 --> 12:49.036
Looks like a dead
baby's finger. Oooh.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.539
Oh. Tastes like it, too.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.335
I'm Colin, by the way.

12:57.419 --> 12:59.921
I'm Nancy.
- Wicked.

13:00.004 --> 13:02.407
What do you do, Nancy?
- I'm a cook.

13:02.507 --> 13:04.409
Ever do weddings?
- Yes, I do.

13:04.509 --> 13:07.230
They should've asked
you to do this one.

13:07.330 --> 13:08.330
They did.

13:08.430 --> 13:10.817
God, I wish you hadn't
have turned it down.

13:10.917 --> 13:11.917
I didn't.

13:12.017 --> 13:14.312
Right.

13:16.813 --> 13:19.116
I've worked out why I
can't find true love.

13:19.216 --> 13:20.216
Why is that?

13:20.316 --> 13:22.761
English girls. They're
stuck up, you see.

13:22.861 --> 13:25.436
And I am primarily
attractive to girls...

13:25.536 --> 13:27.599
who are cooler,
game for a laugh.

13:27.699 --> 13:29.349
Like American girls.

13:29.449 --> 13:31.937
So I should just
go to America.

13:32.037 --> 13:34.051
I'd get a girlfriend
there instantly.

13:34.151 --> 13:35.105
What do you think?

13:35.205 --> 13:37.458
I think it's crap, Colin.

13:37.541 --> 13:39.318
That's where you're wrong.

13:39.418 --> 13:40.912
American girls
would dig me...

13:41.012 --> 13:42.404
with my cute British accent.

13:42.504 --> 13:44.660
You don't have a
cute British accent.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.617
Yes, I do. I'm
going to America.

13:46.717 --> 13:49.062
Colin, you're a
lonely, ugly arsehole.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.162
Accept it.

13:50.262 --> 13:52.218
Never. I am Colin,
God of Sex.

13:52.318 --> 13:55.209
I'm just on the wrong
continent, that's all.

13:55.309 --> 13:56.458
Bit of quiet...

13:56.558 --> 13:59.380
while we finish
the lighting, guys.

13:59.480 --> 14:02.841
The traffic today was just...
- Unbelievable.

14:02.941 --> 14:05.344
Judy, could you take
the top off this time?

14:05.444 --> 14:07.492
Lighting need to know
when we're gonna...

14:07.592 --> 14:09.640
see the, erm, nipples
and when we're not.

14:09.740 --> 14:10.740
Yes, OK. Right.

14:10.840 --> 14:13.309
At least it's nice
and warm in here.

14:13.409 --> 14:14.811
Not always the case, is it?

14:14.911 --> 14:17.103
I was standing in
for Brad Pitt once...

14:17.203 --> 14:18.648
on Seven Years In Tibet...

14:18.748 --> 14:20.942
Yes, yeah.
- Bloody freezing...

14:21.042 --> 14:22.153
Guys, time's tight...

14:22.253 --> 14:24.028
and we have to
get the actors in.

14:24.128 --> 14:26.239
Fine.
- I promise I won't look.

14:29.050 --> 14:33.895
Right, let's have
another look at that, please.

14:44.190 --> 14:46.593
Can you just put your
hands on her breasts?

14:46.693 --> 14:48.970
OK, yeah. Is that all right?
- Yes.

14:49.070 --> 14:51.070
I'll warm them up.

14:53.657 --> 14:56.535
And massage them, please.
- Right.

15:01.998 --> 15:05.858
It's junction 13 that's
just murder, isn't it?

15:05.958 --> 15:08.338
Total gridlock this morning.

15:11.133 --> 15:16.013
Jo and I had a lot of time
to prepare for this moment.

15:16.096 --> 15:18.473
Some of her requests,

15:18.557 --> 15:20.981
for instance, that
I should bring

15:21.081 --> 15:24.254
Claudia Schiffer as my
date to the funeral,

15:24.354 --> 15:28.191
I was confident she
expected me to ignore.

15:28.275 --> 15:31.930
But others she was
pretty damn clear about.

15:32.778 --> 15:36.773
When she first mentioned
what's about to happen,

15:37.116 --> 15:39.702
I said, 'Over my dead body. '

15:39.785 --> 15:42.897
And she said, 'No,
Daniel, over mine. '

15:42.997 --> 15:46.125
And as usual, my
darling girl...

15:47.877 --> 15:50.597
and Sam's darling
mum was right.

15:51.630 --> 15:54.611
So she's going to say
her final farewell...

15:54.711 --> 15:56.494
to you not through me but,

15:56.594 --> 15:58.637
inevitably,

15:59.930 --> 16:01.974
ever so coolly,

16:03.059 --> 16:05.293
through the
immortal genius...

16:05.393 --> 16:07.171
of the Bay City Rollers.

16:08.572 --> 16:11.025
Bye bye baby,
baby goodbye

16:11.108 --> 16:15.362
Goodbye baby,
baby bye bye

16:15.445 --> 16:17.264
Bye bye baby

16:17.364 --> 16:19.342
Don't make me cry

16:19.442 --> 16:22.494
Goodbye baby,
baby bye bye

16:22.577 --> 16:26.498
You're the one girl
in town I'd marry

16:26.581 --> 16:31.920
Girl I'd marry you
now if I were free

16:31.961 --> 16:37.050
I wish it could be

16:37.133 --> 16:41.054
I could love you
but why begin it?

16:41.137 --> 16:44.182
Cos there ain't
any future in it

16:44.265 --> 16:47.811
She's got me but
I'm not free so...

16:49.904 --> 16:51.590
Bye bye baby,
baby goodbye

16:51.690 --> 16:56.360
Goodbye baby,
baby bye bye

16:56.443 --> 16:59.238
Bye bye baby,
don't make me cry

16:59.321 --> 17:03.325
Goodbye baby,
baby bye bye

17:03.409 --> 17:05.185
Wish I never
had known you...

17:05.285 --> 17:07.829
Do you love him?

17:07.913 --> 17:09.957
Er, er, what?

17:10.040 --> 17:11.933
No, I-I just thought
I'd ask bluntly...

17:12.032 --> 17:13.777
in case it was the
right question...

17:13.877 --> 17:16.744
and you needed someone
to talk to about it...

17:16.845 --> 17:18.741
and no one had
ever asked you.

17:18.840 --> 17:23.637
No. No. No is the
answer. Absolutely not.

17:23.721 --> 17:25.721
...on my finger...

17:25.763 --> 17:27.625
So that's a no, then?

17:27.724 --> 17:29.852
Yes. Erm...

17:29.935 --> 17:32.395
Bye bye baby,
baby goodbye

17:32.478 --> 17:34.505
Goodbye baby,
baby bye bye...

17:34.605 --> 17:37.483
This DJ, what
do you reckon?

17:37.567 --> 17:40.445
The worst in history?
- Probably.

17:40.528 --> 17:42.931
I think it all hangs
on the next song.

17:43.031 --> 17:45.016
Now here's one
for the lovers.

17:45.116 --> 17:46.738
That's quite a few of you,

17:46.838 --> 17:49.103
I shouldn't be
surprised and a half.

17:52.915 --> 17:55.209
And they called it...

17:55.293 --> 18:00.423
He's done it, it's official.
- Worst DJ in the world.

18:00.506 --> 18:04.635
Oh, I guess they'll
never know...

18:08.014 --> 18:10.054
Sarah's waiting for you.

18:10.975 --> 18:13.477
Oh, yes, of course, erm...

18:14.227 --> 18:16.521
Great, er, good, good.

18:16.605 --> 18:18.072
How are you doing, Mia?

18:18.172 --> 18:20.759
Settling in fine?
Learning who to avoid?

18:20.859 --> 18:22.859
Absolutely.

18:24.905 --> 18:26.682
Harry?
- Sarah,

18:26.782 --> 18:30.346
switch off your phone
and tell me exactly...

18:30.446 --> 18:34.271
how long it is that
you've been working here.

18:36.667 --> 18:39.586
Two years, seven months,

18:39.670 --> 18:42.322
three days and, I
suppose, what, two hours?

18:42.422 --> 18:45.250
And how long have
you been in love...

18:45.350 --> 18:48.412
with Karl, our enigmatic
chief designer?

18:48.512 --> 18:50.555
Um...

18:53.516 --> 18:55.907
Two years, seven
months, three days...

18:56.007 --> 18:58.462
and, I suppose, an
hour and 30 minutes.

18:58.562 --> 19:00.214
Thought as much.

19:00.314 --> 19:02.045
Do you think
everybody knows?

19:02.145 --> 19:02.341
Yes.

19:02.441 --> 19:04.991
Do you think Karl knows?
- Yes.

19:05.820 --> 19:08.781
Oh, that is...
that is bad news.

19:08.864 --> 19:11.826
I just thought that
maybe the time...

19:11.926 --> 19:14.816
had come to do
something about it.

19:15.371 --> 19:17.815
Like what?
- Invite him out for a drink...

19:17.915 --> 19:20.517
then casually mention
you'd like to marry...

19:20.617 --> 19:22.737
him and have lots
of sex and babies.

19:22.837 --> 19:25.172
You know that?
- Yes.

19:26.424 --> 19:28.676
And so does Karl.

19:28.759 --> 19:31.203
Think about it,
for all our sakes.

19:31.303 --> 19:33.847
It's Christmas.

19:35.306 --> 19:38.810
Certainly. Excellent. Will do.

19:38.893 --> 19:41.062
Thanks, boss.

19:42.689 --> 19:44.941
Hi, Sarah.
- Hi, Karl.

19:55.618 --> 19:58.830
Babe. Absolutely, fire away.

19:59.998 --> 20:02.973
Mia, Mia, would
you turn that down?

20:04.294 --> 20:05.987
What is that?

20:06.087 --> 20:07.851
That was the
Christmas effort...

20:07.951 --> 20:09.658
from the once
great Billy Mack.

20:09.758 --> 20:12.660
Oh, dear me, how are
the mighty fallen.

20:12.760 --> 20:16.195
I can safely say that
is the worst record

20:16.295 --> 20:18.374
I've heard this century...

20:18.474 --> 20:20.083
Oh, and coincidentally,

20:20.183 --> 20:22.586
I believe Billy
will be a guest...

20:22.686 --> 20:26.006
on my friend Mike's show
in a few minutes' time.

20:26.106 --> 20:28.650
Welcome back, Bill.

20:28.734 --> 20:30.761
Billy, welcome back
to the airwaves.

20:30.861 --> 20:34.014
New Christmas single,
cover of Love Is All Around.

20:34.114 --> 20:36.338
Except we've changed...

20:36.438 --> 20:39.453
the word 'love'
to 'Christmas'.

20:39.495 --> 20:41.548
Yes, is that an
important message...

20:41.648 --> 20:42.648
to you, Bill?

20:42.748 --> 20:45.209
Not really, Mike.

20:45.292 --> 20:47.231
Christmas is a
time for people...

20:47.331 --> 20:49.572
with someone they
love in their lives.

20:49.672 --> 20:52.116
And that's not you?
- That's not me, Michael.

20:52.216 --> 20:54.305
When I was young
and successful,

20:54.405 --> 20:56.160
I was greedy and foolish...

20:56.260 --> 20:58.705
and now I'm left
with no one,

20:58.805 --> 21:00.373
wrinkled and alone.

21:00.473 --> 21:03.167
Wow. Thanks for that, Bill.
- For what?

21:03.267 --> 21:06.087
For actually giving
a real answer to a question.

21:06.187 --> 21:07.927
It doesn't often happen here...

21:08.027 --> 21:09.882
at Radio Watford,
I can tell you.

21:09.982 --> 21:12.327
Ask me anything, I'll
tell you the truth.

21:12.427 --> 21:13.720
Best shag you ever had?

21:13.820 --> 21:16.531
Britney Spears.
- Wow.

21:16.614 --> 21:18.850
No, only kidding...

21:18.950 --> 21:21.311
She was rubbish.
- OK, here's one.

21:21.411 --> 21:23.581
How do you think
the new record...

21:23.681 --> 21:25.982
compares to your
old, classic stuff?

21:26.082 --> 21:28.490
Come on, Mikey, you
know as well as I do...

21:28.590 --> 21:29.569
the record's crap.

21:31.421 --> 21:32.954
But wouldn't it be great...

21:33.054 --> 21:34.823
if number one
this Christmas...

21:34.923 --> 21:37.200
wasn't some smug
teenager...

21:37.300 --> 21:39.138
but an old ex-heroin addict...

21:39.238 --> 21:41.580
searching for a
comeback at any price?

21:41.680 --> 21:43.579
Those young popsters
come Christmas...

21:43.679 --> 21:45.167
will be stretched
out naked...

21:45.267 --> 21:47.920
with a cute bird balancing
on their balls...

21:48.020 --> 21:50.330
and I'll be stuck in
some dingy flat...

21:50.430 --> 21:51.590
with me manager Joe,

21:51.690 --> 21:53.815
ugliest man in the world,

21:53.859 --> 21:55.798
fucking miserable because...

21:55.898 --> 21:58.263
our fucking gamble
didn't pay off.

21:58.363 --> 22:00.967
So if you believe in
Father Christmas,

22:01.067 --> 22:03.602
children, like your
Uncle Billy does,

22:03.702 --> 22:07.456
buy my festering
turd of a record.

22:07.539 --> 22:10.525
And particularly enjoy
the incredible crassness...

22:10.625 --> 22:12.626
of the moment we
try to squeeze...

22:12.726 --> 22:15.029
an extra syllable
into the fourth line.

22:15.129 --> 22:17.365
I think you're referring to...

22:17.465 --> 22:19.742
'If you really
love Christmas... '

22:19.842 --> 22:23.054
'Come on and let
it snow. ' Ouch.

22:23.137 --> 22:25.164
So, here it is one more time,

22:25.264 --> 22:27.142
the dark horse
for this year's

22:27.242 --> 22:28.542
Christmas number one,

22:28.642 --> 22:30.286
Christmas Is All Around.

22:30.386 --> 22:33.089
Thank you, Billy.
After this, the news.

22:33.189 --> 22:36.759
Is the new prime minister
in trouble already?

22:36.859 --> 22:40.863
I feel it in my fingers
I feel it in my toes...

22:41.864 --> 22:44.475
OK. What's next?
- The President's visit.

22:44.575 --> 22:47.537
Ah, yes, yes. I fear
this is going to be...

22:47.637 --> 22:49.689
a difficult one to play. Alex.

22:49.789 --> 22:51.801
There's a strong
feeling in the party...

22:51.901 --> 22:54.067
we mustn't allow
ourselves to be bullied...

22:54.167 --> 22:56.653
like the last government.
- Here, here.

22:56.753 --> 22:59.463
This is our first
really important test,

22:59.563 --> 23:00.824
let's take a stand.

23:00.924 --> 23:03.762
Right. Right. I
understand that...

23:03.862 --> 23:05.862
but I have decided...

23:07.180 --> 23:09.224
not to. Not this time.

23:09.307 --> 23:11.198
Let's not forget
that America...

23:11.298 --> 23:13.795
is the most powerful
country in the world.

23:13.895 --> 23:17.550
I'm not going to act
like a petulant child.

23:18.483 --> 23:21.528
Who do you have to
screw round here...

23:21.628 --> 23:24.518
to get a cup of
tea and a biscuit?

23:29.244 --> 23:30.979
Right.

23:32.871 --> 23:34.999
Yeah, come in.

23:39.253 --> 23:40.764
These are from
the Treasury...

23:40.864 --> 23:41.864
Uh-huh.

23:41.964 --> 23:45.050
...and these are for you.

23:45.134 --> 23:46.869
Excellent. Thanks a lot.

23:46.969 --> 23:48.645
I was hoping you'd
win, not that

23:48.745 --> 23:51.123
I wouldn't have been
nice to the other bloke,

23:51.223 --> 23:53.914
just always given him
the boring biscuits...

23:54.014 --> 23:55.085
with no chocolate.

23:55.185 --> 23:57.480
Thanks very
much. Thanks...

23:58.731 --> 24:00.858
Natalie.

24:05.362 --> 24:07.437
God, come on, get a grip.

24:07.537 --> 24:11.107
You're the Prime
Minister, for God's sake.

24:12.243 --> 24:14.729
So what do you reckon
to our new prime minister?

24:14.829 --> 24:17.319
Oh, I like him. I
can't understand...

24:17.419 --> 24:19.359
why he's not
married, though.

24:19.459 --> 24:22.570
You know the type, he's
married to his job.

24:22.670 --> 24:25.900
Either that or gay
as a picnic basket.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.732
Excuse me, Judy,
if you could...

24:27.832 --> 24:29.202
just lower the nipples...

24:29.302 --> 24:31.432
and cheat them a
bit to the left?

24:31.532 --> 24:33.532
OK.

24:35.058 --> 24:37.627
I have to say, Judy,
this is a real pleasure,

24:37.727 --> 24:41.381
it's lovely to find someone
I can actually chat to.

24:41.481 --> 24:43.508
Thank you.
- Oh, well, you know.

24:43.608 --> 24:45.301
And ditto.
- Thank you.

24:45.401 --> 24:47.720
The move again,
please, Judy.

24:47.820 --> 24:48.820
Ooh, sorry.

24:48.920 --> 24:51.475
Oh, God, sorry.
You all right?

24:53.450 --> 24:56.495
Exciting news.
- What?

24:56.578 --> 24:58.506
I've bought a ticket
to the States.

24:58.606 --> 24:59.856
I'm off in three weeks.

24:59.956 --> 25:01.358
No.
- Yes.

25:01.458 --> 25:04.487
To a fantastic place
called Wisconsin.

25:04.587 --> 25:05.571
No.

25:05.671 --> 25:09.299
Yes. Wisconsin babes,
here comes Sir Colin.

25:09.383 --> 25:12.437
No, Col. There are a
few babes in America,

25:12.537 --> 25:13.537
I grant you,

25:13.637 --> 25:16.373
but they're going out
with rich, attractive guys.

25:16.473 --> 25:19.685
Tone, you're just jealous.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.364
You know perfectly well...

25:21.464 --> 25:23.630
that any bar anywhere
in America...

25:23.730 --> 25:25.803
contains ten girls
more beautiful...

25:25.903 --> 25:28.093
and more likely to
have sex with me...

25:28.193 --> 25:30.514
than the whole of
the United Kingdom.

25:30.614 --> 25:32.805
That is total
bollocks. You're mad.

25:32.905 --> 25:36.033
No, I'm wise. Stateside
I am Prince William...

25:36.133 --> 25:37.810
without the weird family.

25:37.910 --> 25:40.162
No, Colin, no.
- Yes.

25:40.246 --> 25:41.397
Nyet.
- Da.

25:41.497 --> 25:42.815
Nein.
- Ja, darling.

25:42.915 --> 25:44.424
Right, the Christmas party,

25:44.524 --> 25:46.611
not my favourite
night of the year...

25:46.711 --> 25:49.030
and your unhappy
job to organise.

25:49.130 --> 25:52.091
Tell me.
- It's basic, really.

25:52.174 --> 25:54.427
Find a venue, over-order
on the drinks,

25:54.527 --> 25:55.953
bulk buy the guacamole...

25:56.053 --> 25:58.024
and advise the girls
to avoid Kevin...

25:58.124 --> 26:00.041
if they want their
breasts unfondled.

26:00.141 --> 26:04.587
Wives and family and stuff?
- Yeah. I mean, not children.

26:04.687 --> 26:08.342
But their wives and
girlfriends, et cetera.

26:08.357 --> 26:11.222
Oh, Christ, you haven't
got some horrible...

26:11.322 --> 26:12.954
six-foot, tight-T
- shirt-wearing...

26:13.054 --> 26:14.054
boyfriend?

26:14.154 --> 26:18.014
No. I'll just be hanging
around the mistletoe,

26:18.114 --> 26:20.114
hoping to be kissed.

26:20.285 --> 26:22.996
Really?

26:23.079 --> 26:25.123
Right.

26:34.507 --> 26:36.617
He now spends all
the time in his room.

26:36.717 --> 26:38.328
I mean, he'll be
up there now.

26:38.428 --> 26:40.982
That's not unusual.
My horrid son...

26:41.082 --> 26:42.082
Bernard?

26:42.182 --> 26:45.396
Bernard. Stays in his
room all the time.

26:45.496 --> 26:46.670
Thank goodness.

26:46.770 --> 26:50.000
Yeah, but Karen, this
is all the time.

26:51.066 --> 26:53.524
I'm afraid that
there's something...

26:53.624 --> 26:55.177
really wrong, you know?

26:55.277 --> 26:57.304
I mean, clearly it's
about his mum...

26:57.404 --> 27:00.247
but Christ, he might
be injecting heroin...

27:00.347 --> 27:02.518
into his eyeballs
for all I know.

27:02.618 --> 27:04.353
At the age of 11?

27:04.453 --> 27:07.243
Well, maybe
not his eyeballs, then.

27:07.343 --> 27:08.649
Maybe just his veins.

27:08.749 --> 27:10.732
The problem is his mum...

27:10.832 --> 27:14.572
always used to talk to
him, you know, and...

27:14.838 --> 27:17.845
I don't know, this whole
stepfather thing...

27:17.945 --> 27:20.119
seems suddenly to
somehow matter

27:20.219 --> 27:22.471
like it never did before.

27:22.554 --> 27:25.588
Listen, it was always
going to be...

27:25.688 --> 27:27.334
a totally shit time.

27:27.434 --> 27:29.978
Just be patient.

27:30.062 --> 27:32.380
And maybe check the
room for needles.

27:32.480 --> 27:35.203
And then when he
sometimes does...

27:35.303 --> 27:38.703
come out, it's obvious
he's been crying.

27:46.661 --> 27:50.164
It's just such a
ridiculous waste.

27:50.248 --> 27:54.498
And now if it's going to ruin
Sam's life as well...

27:54.794 --> 27:57.630
I just don't know.

27:57.714 --> 28:00.383
Get a grip.

28:00.466 --> 28:02.635
People hate sissies.

28:02.719 --> 28:04.493
No one's ever
gonna shag you...

28:04.593 --> 28:05.955
if you cry all the time.

28:06.055 --> 28:08.975
Yeah. Absolutely.

28:09.058 --> 28:11.102
Helpful.

28:18.817 --> 28:22.654
So, what's the
problem, Samuel?

28:24.573 --> 28:29.369
Is it just Mum or is it
something else, huh?

28:30.787 --> 28:32.914
Maybe school?

28:34.124 --> 28:36.124
Are you being bullied?

28:37.169 --> 28:39.338
Or is it something worse?

28:41.173 --> 28:43.978
Can you give me
any clues at all?

28:45.052 --> 28:48.247
You really want to know?
- I really want to know.

28:48.347 --> 28:50.874
Even though you won't
be able to help?

28:50.974 --> 28:53.559
Even if that's
the case, yeah.

28:55.603 --> 28:58.022
OK. Well...

28:59.231 --> 29:01.984
truth is, actually...

29:03.069 --> 29:04.929
I'm in love.

29:05.029 --> 29:06.597
Sorry?

29:06.697 --> 29:08.738
I know I should be thinking...

29:08.838 --> 29:11.227
about Mum and I am
but I'm in love.

29:11.327 --> 29:12.918
I was before she died...

29:13.018 --> 29:15.565
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

29:15.665 --> 29:18.610
Aren't you a bit
young to be in love?

29:18.710 --> 29:19.694
No.

29:19.794 --> 29:22.797
Ah, well. OK, well...

29:24.674 --> 29:27.176
I'm a little relieved.

29:28.302 --> 29:30.429
Why?
- Because I...

29:30.513 --> 29:32.622
thought it'd be
something worse.

29:32.722 --> 29:35.709
Worse than the total
agony of being in love?

29:35.809 --> 29:38.478
Er...

29:38.520 --> 29:41.189
No, you're right.

29:41.272 --> 29:43.400
Total agony.

30:20.477 --> 30:22.772
Night, Sarah.
- Night, Karl.

30:32.573 --> 30:34.616
Yeah, absolutely.

30:35.743 --> 30:37.953
Free as a bird. Fire away.

31:09.484 --> 31:11.611
Alone again.

31:12.904 --> 31:14.556
Naturally.

31:14.656 --> 31:16.783
I'll deal with it.
- Mm.

31:17.909 --> 31:21.454
Ah. Natalie.
- Sir.

31:23.456 --> 31:25.024
Thanks.

31:25.124 --> 31:27.168
Natalie.

31:29.504 --> 31:32.214
Erm, I'm starting to feel...

31:33.423 --> 31:35.023
uncomfortable about us...

31:35.123 --> 31:37.119
working so closely
every day...

31:37.219 --> 31:40.144
and me knowing so
little about you,

31:40.244 --> 31:42.539
it seems elitist and wrong.

31:42.891 --> 31:44.668
Well, there's
not much to know.

31:44.768 --> 31:48.255
Well, erm, where do
you live, for instance?

31:48.355 --> 31:50.565
Wandsworth.
The dodgy end.

31:50.607 --> 31:52.844
Ah, my sister lives
in Wandsworth.

31:52.944 --> 31:54.944
Oh.

31:55.237 --> 31:57.764
So which exactly
is the dodgy end?

31:57.864 --> 31:59.413
At the end of
the high street,

31:59.513 --> 32:01.435
Harris Street, near
the Queen's Head.

32:01.535 --> 32:03.254
Oh, yeah, yeah,
that is dodgy.

32:03.354 --> 32:04.354
Hm.

32:04.454 --> 32:06.141
Erm, and you live...

32:06.241 --> 32:08.709
with your husband?
Boyfriend?

32:10.002 --> 32:11.846
Three illegitimate
but charming children?

32:11.946 --> 32:12.945
No.

32:13.045 --> 32:15.273
I've just split up
with my boyfriend, so

32:15.373 --> 32:17.658
I'm back with my mum
and dad for a while.

32:17.758 --> 32:22.054
Ah. Sorry.
- No, it's fine.

32:22.138 --> 32:24.557
I'm well shot of him.

32:24.640 --> 32:27.418
He said I was getting fat.
- I beg your pardon?

32:27.518 --> 32:29.305
He said no one'd
fancy a girl...

32:29.405 --> 32:31.422
with thighs the size
of tree trunks.

32:31.522 --> 32:34.667
Not a nice guy,
actually, in the end.

32:35.484 --> 32:37.528
No.

32:44.577 --> 32:46.746
You know, erm...

32:47.413 --> 32:49.148
being Prime Minister,

32:49.248 --> 32:51.734
I could just have
him murdered.

32:51.834 --> 32:54.277
Thank you, sir. I'll
think about it.

32:54.377 --> 32:58.298
Do. The SAS are
absolutely charming.

32:58.381 --> 33:02.801
Ruthless, trained killers
are just a phone call away.

33:08.058 --> 33:10.101
Oh, God.

33:12.771 --> 33:15.661
Did you have this
kind of problem?

33:17.567 --> 33:20.136
Yeah, course you
did, you saucy minx.

33:20.236 --> 33:23.640
So, let's go. We can
definitely crack this.

33:23.740 --> 33:25.934
Remember, I was
a kid once, too.

33:26.034 --> 33:30.413
So, come on, it's
someone at school. Right?

33:30.497 --> 33:32.356
Yeah.
- Uh-huh. Good, good.

33:32.456 --> 33:35.526
And what does she,
he, feel about you?

33:35.626 --> 33:38.545
SHE doesn't even
know my name.

33:38.629 --> 33:41.407
And even if she did,
she'd despise me.

33:41.507 --> 33:43.826
She's the coolest
girl in school.

33:43.926 --> 33:48.013
And everyone worships her
because she's heaven.

33:48.097 --> 33:50.599
Good. Good.

33:51.892 --> 33:54.019
Well,

33:54.103 --> 33:57.163
basically you're
fucked, aren't you?

34:03.028 --> 34:05.489
Hi there and welcome back.

34:05.572 --> 34:07.842
So, three weeks till
Christmas, looks like...

34:07.942 --> 34:09.851
the real competition
is gonna be Blue.

34:09.952 --> 34:11.958
I saw them on the
show last week.

34:12.059 --> 34:14.438
They weren't very
nice about my record.

34:14.539 --> 34:16.916
No. Little scamps.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.420
But very, very
talented musicians.

34:20.503 --> 34:22.946
Yeah. I understand
you've got a prize...

34:23.045 --> 34:24.741
for our competition
winners.

34:24.841 --> 34:26.284
Yes, I have, Ant or Dec.

34:26.384 --> 34:30.388
It's a personalised
felt-tip pen.

34:30.471 --> 34:32.081
Oh, great.

34:32.181 --> 34:35.935
It's brilliant. It
even writes on glass,

34:36.018 --> 34:38.237
so if you've got
a framed picture,

34:38.338 --> 34:40.757
like, for instance,
this one of Blue,

34:40.857 --> 34:42.982
you can just write on it.

34:56.663 --> 34:59.323
Er, a lot of
kids watching, Billy.

34:59.423 --> 35:00.525
Oh, yeah.

35:00.625 --> 35:03.462
Hiya, kids.

35:03.545 --> 35:05.329
Here's an important
message...

35:05.429 --> 35:06.907
from your Uncle Bill...

35:07.007 --> 35:09.134
don't buy drugs.

35:11.136 --> 35:12.251
Become a pop star...

35:12.351 --> 35:14.164
and they give you
them for free.

35:14.264 --> 35:17.054
And I do believe it's
a commercial break.

35:17.154 --> 35:19.044
We'll see you
soon. Bye-bye.

35:19.144 --> 35:23.940
All I want for
Christmas is you...

35:31.198 --> 35:35.326
Look at him. Eurh.
- Just a minute.

35:35.409 --> 35:38.894
Actually, they're not
funny. They're art.

35:42.500 --> 35:45.194
OK, let's say, er,
Thursday, my place.

35:45.294 --> 35:47.739
Great. I've got Juliet
on the other line,

35:47.839 --> 35:49.615
she wants to ask
you a favour.

35:49.715 --> 35:54.679
OK, fine.
- Thanks and, er, be nice.

35:54.762 --> 35:56.087
I'm always nice.

35:56.187 --> 35:59.842
'You know what I mean,
Marky, be friendly. '

35:59.934 --> 36:02.253
I'm always...
- 'Mark? '

36:02.353 --> 36:05.272
Hi. How was
the honeymoon?

36:05.356 --> 36:06.096
It was great.

36:06.196 --> 36:08.092
Thanks for the
gorgeous sendoff.

36:08.192 --> 36:11.762
So, what can I do for you?
- 'It's only a tiny favour. '

36:11.862 --> 36:13.704
I've just tried the
wedding video...

36:13.804 --> 36:14.806
and it's a disaster.

36:14.906 --> 36:16.834
'It's come out all
blue and wibbly. '

36:16.934 --> 36:17.934
I'm sorry.

36:18.034 --> 36:19.650
I remember you filming a lot...

36:19.750 --> 36:21.688
and I wondered if
I could look at it.

36:21.788 --> 36:23.857
To be honest, I
didn't really...

36:23.957 --> 36:26.205
Please. All I want
is one shot of me...

36:26.305 --> 36:28.612
in a wedding dress
that isn't turquoise.

36:28.712 --> 36:31.844
I'll have a look but I'm
pretty sure I wiped it,

36:31.944 --> 36:33.617
so don't get any hopes up.

36:33.717 --> 36:36.553
'Must go. '

36:41.224 --> 36:44.002
Any progress with our
matchmaking plans?

36:44.102 --> 36:46.315
No. I've done fuck-all
and never will...

36:46.415 --> 36:48.006
because he's
too good for me.

36:48.106 --> 36:50.150
How true.

36:51.609 --> 36:53.652
Stop.

36:53.736 --> 36:56.456
And of course,
your mobile goes.

36:56.989 --> 36:59.658
Hello. Hi. How you doing?

37:00.743 --> 37:02.504
So, how's the
Christmas party going?

37:02.604 --> 37:03.604
Good.

37:03.704 --> 37:05.873
Think I've found a venue.

37:05.956 --> 37:09.335
What's it like?
- Good. Good.

37:09.418 --> 37:12.935
It's an art gallery.
Full of dark corners...

37:13.035 --> 37:15.035
for doing dark deeds.

37:16.383 --> 37:19.720
Oh. Right.

37:19.803 --> 37:21.895
Good. Well, I
suppose I should...

37:21.995 --> 37:23.958
take a look at
it or something.

37:24.058 --> 37:26.143
You should.

37:45.244 --> 37:46.771
Ah, bonjour, Eleonore.

37:46.871 --> 37:49.691
Bonjour, Monsieur
Bennett. Welcome back.

37:49.791 --> 37:51.859
And this year you
bring a lady guest?

37:51.959 --> 37:55.154
No. There's a change
of situation. Just me.

37:55.254 --> 37:57.199
Oh. Am I sad or not sad?

37:57.299 --> 37:59.659
I think you're not surprised.

37:59.759 --> 38:01.730
And you stay here
till Christmas?

38:01.830 --> 38:02.453
Yeah, yeah.

38:02.553 --> 38:04.712
Good. Well, I find you...

38:04.812 --> 38:07.767
a perfect lady to
clean the house.

38:07.850 --> 38:10.395
This is Aurelia.

38:10.478 --> 38:12.477
Ah.

38:12.479 --> 38:16.525
Er, bonjour, Aurelia.
- Bonjour.

38:16.608 --> 38:20.123
Er, je suis,
er, trés heureux...

38:20.223 --> 38:22.223
de vous avoir ici.

38:22.531 --> 38:25.661
Unfortunately, she
cannot speak French,

38:25.761 --> 38:26.852
just like you.

38:26.952 --> 38:28.952
She's Portuguese.

38:28.954 --> 38:31.540
Ah, ah, buongiorno.

38:31.623 --> 38:33.623
Eusebio, er, er...

38:33.625 --> 38:36.600
Er, molto bueno...

38:37.295 --> 38:39.608
I think she's ten
years too young...

38:39.708 --> 38:42.284
to remember a footballer
called Eusebio.

38:42.384 --> 38:44.745
And 'molto bueno'
is Spanish.

38:44.845 --> 38:46.330
Right.

38:46.430 --> 38:49.490
Anyway, it's nice
to meet you and...

38:49.766 --> 38:51.960
Can you drive her
home after her work?

38:52.059 --> 38:53.491
Oh, absolutely, yes.

38:53.591 --> 38:55.838
Con-Con grande,
er, pl-plesura.

38:55.938 --> 38:58.149
Which is what? Turkish?

39:05.906 --> 39:08.116
Bello.

39:09.618 --> 39:11.662
Er, bella.

39:12.872 --> 39:15.207
Er, mon-montagno,

39:15.291 --> 39:17.335
arvarez...

39:20.296 --> 39:22.840
No, right. Silence is golden.

39:24.925 --> 39:27.094
As the Tremeloes said.

39:28.971 --> 39:30.623
Clever guys,

39:30.723 --> 39:33.483
although I think the
original version was...

39:33.583 --> 39:35.961
by Frankie Valli And
The Four Seasons.

39:36.061 --> 39:38.061
Gr-great band.

39:40.690 --> 39:43.068
Oh, shut up.

39:53.912 --> 39:56.081
Mr President.

39:57.874 --> 39:59.154
Over here, sir.

39:59.254 --> 40:01.954
What will you be
talking about?

40:02.045 --> 40:03.697
Mr President, welcome.

40:03.797 --> 40:05.365
It's a pleasure to meet you.

40:05.465 --> 40:06.465
Come through.

40:06.565 --> 40:08.243
I'm sorry your wife
couldn't make it.

40:08.343 --> 40:10.480
So is she. Although
she would have been...

40:10.580 --> 40:11.580
kind of lonely.

40:11.680 --> 40:13.722
Yes. Pathetic, isn't it?

40:13.806 --> 40:16.250
Just never been able
to tie a girl down.

40:16.350 --> 40:18.961
Not sure that politics
and dating go together.

40:19.061 --> 40:22.022
Really? I've
never found that.

40:22.106 --> 40:24.374
Yeah, you're still
sickeningly handsome,

40:24.474 --> 40:26.510
whereas I look like
my Aunt Mildred.

40:26.610 --> 40:29.191
Very jealous of your
plane, by the way.

40:29.291 --> 40:31.265
Thank you. We
love that thing.

40:31.365 --> 40:33.617
Ah, Natalie. Hi.

40:33.701 --> 40:36.395
Morning, ma'am. How's
your day so far?

40:36.495 --> 40:39.164
Excellent.

40:41.834 --> 40:43.073
My goodness,

40:43.173 --> 40:45.571
that's a pretty little
son of a bitch.

40:45.671 --> 40:47.715
Did you see those pipes?

40:47.798 --> 40:50.968
Yeah, she's
terrific. At her job.

40:51.051 --> 40:53.191
No, absolutely
not. We cannot...

40:53.291 --> 40:55.705
and will not consult
on that either.

40:55.805 --> 40:57.665
That is unexpected.

40:57.765 --> 41:00.226
Well, it shouldn't be.

41:00.310 --> 41:03.463
The last administration
made it perfectly clear.

41:03.563 --> 41:06.382
We're being consistent
with their policies.

41:06.482 --> 41:09.302
With all respect, they
were bad policies.

41:09.402 --> 41:11.034
Thanks, Alex. I don't think...

41:11.134 --> 41:12.597
we're making
progress here.

41:12.697 --> 41:16.576
Let's, erm... move
on, shall we?

41:19.120 --> 41:22.498
Well, now, that was
an interesting day.

41:24.125 --> 41:26.226
Sorry if our line was
firm but there's...

41:26.326 --> 41:28.112
no point in tiptoeing
around today,

41:28.212 --> 41:30.949
then just disappointing
you for four years.

41:31.049 --> 41:33.951
I have plans and I plan
to see them through.

41:34.051 --> 41:35.051
Absolutely.

41:35.151 --> 41:37.079
There is one final
thing to look at.

41:37.179 --> 41:40.374
It's very close to my heart.
Just give me a second.

41:40.474 --> 41:43.043
I'll give you
anything you ask for.

41:43.143 --> 41:45.558
As long as it's
not something

41:45.658 --> 41:47.658
I don't wanna give.

41:50.984 --> 41:52.636
Hi.

41:52.736 --> 41:54.780
Pathetic.

42:15.508 --> 42:18.970
It's great Scotch.

42:19.053 --> 42:22.974
I'll, erm... I'll be going, then.

42:24.475 --> 42:26.769
Er, Natalie,

42:26.852 --> 42:28.877
I hope to see much
more of you...

42:28.977 --> 42:31.757
as our countries work
toward a better future.

42:31.857 --> 42:34.318
Thank you, sir.

42:50.626 --> 42:52.625
Er, yes, Peter.

42:52.627 --> 42:54.863
Mr President, has it
been a good visit?

42:54.963 --> 42:58.508
Very satisfactory indeed.

42:58.591 --> 43:01.261
We got what we came for...

43:01.303 --> 43:04.789
and our special relationship
is still very special.

43:04.889 --> 43:07.392
Prime Minister?

43:07.475 --> 43:09.477
I love that word
'relationship'.

43:09.577 --> 43:11.963
Covers all manner of
sins, doesn't it?

43:12.063 --> 43:15.973
I fear that this has become
a bad relationship.

43:16.776 --> 43:18.406
A relationship based on...

43:18.506 --> 43:20.847
the President taking
what he wants...

43:20.947 --> 43:24.233
and casually ignoring
all those things...

43:24.333 --> 43:26.798
that really matter to, erm...

43:28.621 --> 43:30.665
Britain.

43:30.749 --> 43:34.860
We may be a small country
but we're a great one, too.

43:34.960 --> 43:36.635
The country of
Shakespeare,

43:36.735 --> 43:38.155
Churchill, the Beatles,

43:38.255 --> 43:41.450
Sean Connery, Harry Potter.

43:41.550 --> 43:44.495
David Beckham's right foot.

43:44.595 --> 43:47.248
David Beckham's left
foot, come to that.

43:47.348 --> 43:51.335
And a friend who bullies us
is no longer a friend.

43:51.435 --> 43:53.530
And since bullies only
respond to strength,

43:53.630 --> 43:54.630
from now onward,

43:54.730 --> 43:58.442
I will be prepared
to be much stronger.

43:58.525 --> 44:01.762
And the President
should be prepared for that.

44:11.664 --> 44:13.706
Mr President.

44:17.835 --> 44:19.835
Joe.

44:20.171 --> 44:22.721
It's your sister on line four.

44:23.758 --> 44:26.038
All right. Er, yes,
I'm very busy...

44:26.138 --> 44:28.288
and important, how
can I help you?

44:28.388 --> 44:30.498
Have you gone
completely insane?

44:30.598 --> 44:32.223
You can't always
be sensible.

44:32.323 --> 44:34.294
'You can if you're
Prime Minister. '

44:34.394 --> 44:36.030
It's the Chancellor
on the other line.

44:36.130 --> 44:37.130
It isn't.

44:37.230 --> 44:40.375
'I'll call you back. '
- No, you won't.

44:41.901 --> 44:44.815
The trouble with being
the Prime Minister's...

44:44.915 --> 44:47.765
sister is it puts your
life into perspective.

44:47.865 --> 44:49.434
What did my
brother do today?

44:49.534 --> 44:50.935
He fought for his country.

44:51.035 --> 44:52.283
What did I do?

44:52.383 --> 44:55.580
I made a papier-maché
lobster head.

44:55.664 --> 44:58.192
What is this we're
listening to?

44:58.292 --> 45:00.544
Joni Mitchell.

45:00.627 --> 45:03.447
I can't believe you still
listen to Joni Mitchell.

45:03.547 --> 45:07.117
I love her and true
love lasts a lifetime.

45:08.552 --> 45:11.185
Joni Mitchell is the
woman who taught...

45:11.285 --> 45:13.582
your cold English
wife how to feel.

45:13.682 --> 45:16.210
Did she? Oh,
well, that's good,

45:16.310 --> 45:19.171
I must write to
her and say thanks.

45:19.271 --> 45:21.506
Which doll for
Daisy's friend Emily?

45:21.606 --> 45:24.271
The one that looks
like a transvestite...

45:24.371 --> 45:26.970
or the one that looks
like a dominatrix?

45:27.070 --> 45:28.917
'It's
almost enough...

45:29.017 --> 45:30.474
to make you feel patriotic,

45:30.574 --> 45:31.683
'so here's one...

45:31.783 --> 45:34.185
for our arse-kicking
prime minister.

45:34.285 --> 45:36.938
'A golden oldie for
a golden oldie. '

45:37.038 --> 45:39.398
Hold me

45:39.498 --> 45:42.209
I'll give you
all that you need

45:43.336 --> 45:46.380
Wrap your love around me

45:46.464 --> 45:50.117
You're so excited
I can feel you getting hotter

45:50.217 --> 45:51.869
Oh baby

45:51.969 --> 45:56.557
I'll take you down,
I'll take you down

45:56.641 --> 45:58.960
Where no one's
ever gone before

45:59.060 --> 46:00.878
And if you want more

46:00.978 --> 46:05.775
If you want
more, more, more

46:05.858 --> 46:08.611
Jump for my love

46:08.694 --> 46:10.555
Jump in

46:10.655 --> 46:12.389
And feel my touch

46:12.489 --> 46:16.601
Jump, if you wanna taste
my kisses in the night then

46:16.701 --> 46:19.371
Jump for my love

46:20.580 --> 46:25.001
I'll take you down,
I'll take you down

46:25.085 --> 46:26.528
Where no one's ever gone...

46:26.628 --> 46:28.488
Yeah, erm,

46:28.588 --> 46:30.984
Mary, can we move
the Japanese...

46:31.084 --> 46:33.702
ambassador to four
o'clock tomorrow?

46:33.802 --> 46:37.372
Certainly, sir.
- Terrific. Thanks so much.

46:44.729 --> 46:47.424
Erm. Would you like
the last, er...?

46:47.524 --> 46:49.801
Thank
you very much but no.

46:49.901 --> 46:52.011
If you saw my sister,
you'd understand why.

46:52.111 --> 46:54.179
That's all right,
more for me.

46:54.856 --> 46:56.432
Just don't go eating
it all yourself,

46:56.532 --> 46:58.017
you're getting
chubbier every day.

46:58.117 --> 47:00.709
I'm very lucky I've
got a constitution...

47:00.809 --> 47:02.563
where I never
put on weight.

47:04.832 --> 47:08.460
Hello.

47:15.301 --> 47:17.761
Oop. Sorry.

47:21.265 --> 47:23.265
Hello?

47:38.823 --> 47:41.367
Thank you.
- Nao.

47:41.451 --> 47:44.604
Eu peco imensa desculpa.
- Oh, no. Hold on.

47:44.704 --> 47:46.452
God, it's half
the book. Oh, no.

47:46.552 --> 47:47.232
Que desastre.

47:47.332 --> 47:50.818
Just leave them, please.
They're not important.

47:50.918 --> 47:53.588
They're not worth it.

47:53.671 --> 47:56.591
Stop. Stop.

47:56.674 --> 47:59.260
Aa-ahh.

48:00.470 --> 48:02.639
It's all just rubbish.

48:04.307 --> 48:06.434
Just leave it.

48:18.362 --> 48:21.573
Oh, God, she's in.

48:21.657 --> 48:24.768
And now she'll think
I'm a total spaz...

48:24.868 --> 48:26.478
if I don't go in too.

48:26.578 --> 48:29.128
Fuck
- it's cold.

48:32.501 --> 48:34.836
Fuck - it's freezing. Fuck.

48:34.920 --> 48:38.235
This
stuff better be good.

48:38.840 --> 48:39.879
It's not worth it,

48:39.979 --> 48:41.743
this isn't bloody
Shakespeare.

48:41.843 --> 48:43.662
I don't
want to drown...

48:43.762 --> 48:45.467
saving some shit
my grandmother...

48:45.567 --> 48:46.498
could have written.

48:46.598 --> 48:48.000
Just stop. Stop.

48:48.100 --> 48:49.773
What
kind of idiot...

48:49.873 --> 48:50.836
doesn't make copies?

48:50.936 --> 48:52.975
I really must do copies.

48:54.188 --> 48:56.340
There'd better not
be eels in here.

48:56.440 --> 48:59.510
Try not
to disturb the eels.

48:59.610 --> 49:01.820
Oh, what the hell is that?

49:11.831 --> 49:14.296
Thank you. Thank
you so much.

49:18.546 --> 49:19.837
I know. I'll name...

49:19.937 --> 49:22.033
one of the characters
after you.

49:22.133 --> 49:24.494
Maybe
you could name...

49:24.594 --> 49:26.621
one of the
characters after me.

49:26.721 --> 49:29.849
Or give me 50%
of the profits.

49:29.932 --> 49:33.161
Or I could give you
5% of the profits.

49:36.146 --> 49:39.291
What
kind of book is it?

49:47.741 --> 49:49.826
Romance?
- Yes.

49:49.909 --> 49:50.909
It's, erm...

49:52.954 --> 49:54.147
Ah, er...

49:54.247 --> 49:56.441
Thr
iller... crime...

49:56.541 --> 49:57.889
Sim.

49:57.989 --> 50:00.487
Crime.
Crime, murder.

50:00.587 --> 50:02.280
Frightening?

50:02.380 --> 50:05.467
Er, scary? Yes,
sometimes scary.

50:05.550 --> 50:07.455
And, er, sometimes not.

50:07.555 --> 50:10.615
Mainly scary how
bad the writing is.

50:19.229 --> 50:21.649
Mm.

50:23.567 --> 50:27.363
I'd better
get back to work.

50:27.446 --> 50:28.446
Ah.

50:28.546 --> 50:31.183
Later
you'll drive me home?

50:31.283 --> 50:33.327
Sure.

50:36.664 --> 50:39.625
It's my favourite
time of day...

50:39.708 --> 50:41.752
driving you.

50:44.046 --> 50:46.984
It's
the saddest part...

50:47.084 --> 50:49.084
of my day, leaving you.

50:54.430 --> 50:56.430
Sorry.

51:23.376 --> 51:24.573
(TV 'And coming up...

51:24.673 --> 51:26.821
later this morning,
it's this guy... '

51:26.921 --> 51:31.301
There's no beginning,
there'll be no end...

51:31.384 --> 51:32.698
Cos on Christmas...

51:32.798 --> 51:35.120
'. He bad grandad
of rock'n'roll,

51:35.220 --> 51:38.195
'here at 10:30. Do
not switch off. '

51:43.770 --> 51:45.631
Banoffee pie?

51:45.731 --> 51:47.466
No, thanks.

51:47.566 --> 51:49.928
Thank God. You would've
broken my heart...

51:50.028 --> 51:51.011
if you'd said yes.

51:51.111 --> 51:54.573
Right, well, lucky you.

51:54.656 --> 51:55.757
Can I come in?

51:55.857 --> 51:58.519
Er, yeah, well,
I'm a bit busy...

51:58.619 --> 52:00.966
I was just passing
and I thought...

52:01.066 --> 52:03.482
we might check that
video thing out.

52:03.582 --> 52:06.485
I thought I might be able
to swap it for some pie...

52:06.585 --> 52:08.837
or maybe Munchies?

52:08.920 --> 52:11.134
Actually, I was serious
- I don't know...

52:11.234 --> 52:13.282
where it is. I'll
have a look tonight.

52:13.382 --> 52:16.302
Mark, can I say something?

52:16.385 --> 52:18.429
Yeah.

52:19.513 --> 52:21.999
I know you're Peter's
best friend...

52:22.099 --> 52:27.229
and I know you've never
particularly warmed to me.

52:27.313 --> 52:30.191
Look, don't, don't argue.

52:30.274 --> 52:32.652
We've never got friendly.

52:32.735 --> 52:35.221
But I wanted to say, I
hope that can change.

52:35.321 --> 52:37.100
I'm nice. I really am.

52:37.200 --> 52:40.643
Apart from my terrible
taste in pie and...

52:40.743 --> 52:43.896
It would be great if
we could be friends.

52:43.996 --> 52:46.040
Absolutely. Absolutely.

52:49.669 --> 52:52.045
Great.

52:52.128 --> 52:55.073
Doesn't mean we'll be able
to find the video, though.

52:55.173 --> 52:57.525
I had a real search when
you first called...

52:57.625 --> 52:58.994
and couldn't find it so...

52:59.094 --> 53:00.076
This one says...

53:00.176 --> 53:01.997
'Peter and
Juliet's Wedding'.

53:02.097 --> 53:04.374
Do you think we might
be on the right track?

53:04.474 --> 53:09.020
Er, yeah, well... Wow.
That-that could be it.

53:09.104 --> 53:11.798
Do you mind if I...?
- I've probably taped over it.

53:11.898 --> 53:15.468
Almost everything's
episodes of West Wing.

53:16.111 --> 53:18.154
Oh.

53:19.781 --> 53:21.866
Oh, bingo.

53:23.535 --> 53:25.620
That's lovely.

53:25.704 --> 53:27.831
Well done, you.

53:29.207 --> 53:31.418
Oh, that's gorgeous.

53:32.876 --> 53:34.866
Thank you so much, Mark,

53:34.966 --> 53:38.196
this is exactly what
I was hoping for.

53:43.971 --> 53:46.223
I look quite pretty.

53:53.522 --> 53:55.817
You've stayed rather close.

54:49.786 --> 54:52.037
They're all of me.

54:56.124 --> 54:59.252
Yeah. Yeah.

54:59.336 --> 55:01.380
Yes.

55:31.576 --> 55:33.575
But...

55:34.662 --> 55:36.831
you never talk to me.

55:39.250 --> 55:41.375
You always talk to Peter.

55:43.879 --> 55:46.048
You don't like me.

55:47.300 --> 55:49.343
I hope it's useful.

55:49.427 --> 55:52.471
Don't show it
around too much.

55:52.555 --> 55:55.725
Needs a bit of editing.

55:55.808 --> 55:59.478
Look, I've got to
get to a... lunch.

55:59.562 --> 56:01.562
Early lunch.

56:01.564 --> 56:05.134
You can just show
yourself out, can't you?

56:10.197 --> 56:14.534
It's a... self-preservation
thing, you see.

56:25.795 --> 56:28.840
Oh I am what I am

56:28.923 --> 56:31.843
I'll do what I want

56:31.926 --> 56:36.681
But I can't hide

56:36.765 --> 56:38.892
And I won't go

56:39.851 --> 56:42.646
I won't sleep

56:42.729 --> 56:45.607
And I can't breathe

56:45.690 --> 56:48.735
Until you're
resting here with me

56:48.818 --> 56:51.404
And I won't leave

56:51.488 --> 56:54.239
And I can't hide

56:54.323 --> 56:57.117
I cannot be

56:57.201 --> 56:59.787
Until you're resting here

56:59.870 --> 57:02.706
And I won't go

57:02.790 --> 57:05.584
And I won't sleep

57:05.668 --> 57:08.545
And I can't breathe

57:08.629 --> 57:13.092
Until you're resting
here with me...

57:13.175 --> 57:16.053
Yeah.

57:18.430 --> 57:21.575
Annie, my darling,
my dream, my boat.

57:22.393 --> 57:24.561
Ah...

57:24.645 --> 57:26.537
Need you to do
a favour for me.

57:26.637 --> 57:27.214
Of course.

57:27.314 --> 57:30.204
Anything for the
hero of the hour.

57:31.193 --> 57:32.185
Don't ask me why,

57:32.285 --> 57:34.137
and don't read
stuff into this,

57:34.237 --> 57:36.639
it's just a weird
personality thing.

57:36.739 --> 57:39.767
But, erm, you know
Natalie who works here?

57:39.867 --> 57:42.370
The chubby girl?

57:42.453 --> 57:44.480
Ooh, would we
call her chubby?

57:44.580 --> 57:48.355
I think there's a pretty
sizeable arse there,

57:48.455 --> 57:50.236
yes, sir. Huge thighs.

57:50.336 --> 57:53.339
Yeah. Well, whatever, erm...

57:54.507 --> 57:56.968
I'm sure she's a lovely girl...

57:57.068 --> 57:59.873
but I wonder if
you could, erm...

58:00.972 --> 58:03.975
redistribute her?

58:04.058 --> 58:06.102
It's done.

58:41.094 --> 58:43.221
Hey, Sammo. Can't sleep?

58:43.972 --> 58:46.083
I got some terrible
news today.

58:46.183 --> 58:48.183
Let's have it.

58:48.226 --> 58:49.982
Joanna's going
back to America.

58:50.082 --> 58:51.255
Your girl's American?

58:51.355 --> 58:53.856
Yes, she's American.

58:53.940 --> 58:56.317
And she's not my girl.

58:56.400 --> 58:58.185
And she's going
back to America.

58:58.285 --> 59:00.471
That's the end of my
life as I know it.

59:00.571 --> 59:02.740
That is bad news.

59:04.867 --> 59:07.328
Well, we need Kate...

59:07.411 --> 59:10.706
and we need Leo, and
we need them now.

59:10.790 --> 59:12.790
Come on.

59:16.295 --> 59:18.422
'Hold on. Hold on.

59:18.506 --> 59:20.758
'Keep your eyes closed.

59:20.841 --> 59:25.304
'Do you trust me? '
- 'I trust you. '

59:26.263 --> 59:28.849
Do you trust me?
- I trust you.

59:28.933 --> 59:31.519
Fool.
- Get off, you big bully.

59:34.104 --> 59:37.190
'All right, open your eyes. '

59:40.360 --> 59:41.360
You know, Sammy,

59:41.460 --> 59:43.930
I'm sure she's unique
and extraordinary...

59:44.030 --> 59:46.975
but general wisdom
is that in the end,

59:47.075 --> 59:50.730
there isn't just one
person for each of us.

59:51.621 --> 59:53.648
There was for Kate and Leo.

59:53.748 --> 59:56.418
There was for you.

59:56.459 --> 59:58.459
And there is for me.

59:58.461 --> 01:00:00.461
She's the one.

01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:04.951
Fair enough. And
her name's Joanna?

01:00:05.051 --> 01:00:08.221
Yeah, I know.
Same as Mum.

01:00:18.564 --> 01:00:21.025
Yeah.

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:27.965
Prime Minister.
- Thank you very much.

01:00:44.238 --> 01:00:45.866
Oh. Appolo...
Erm, appologia.

01:00:45.966 --> 01:00:48.100
Grande, er... grande familio,

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:51.163
grande tradizione de
Christmas presents.

01:00:51.263 --> 01:00:53.306
Stupido.

01:01:19.457 --> 01:01:22.126
Well, goodbye.

01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:24.295
Thank you.

01:01:27.382 --> 01:01:29.842
Erm, it was, erm...

01:01:30.969 --> 01:01:33.971
I
will miss you.

01:01:35.305 --> 01:01:38.183
And your very slow typing...

01:01:39.309 --> 01:01:42.145
and your very bad driving.

01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:47.001
You know I love
Christmas, I always will

01:02:48.502 --> 01:02:53.048
My mind's made up,
the way that I feel

01:02:54.507 --> 01:02:59.054
There's no beginning,
there'll be no end

01:02:59.137 --> 01:03:04.142
Cos on Christmas
you can depend

01:03:10.357 --> 01:03:12.400
Daniel.

01:03:13.526 --> 01:03:17.572
I have a plan.
- Thank the Lord. Tell me.

01:03:17.656 --> 01:03:19.625
Well, girls love
musicians, don't they?

01:03:19.725 --> 01:03:20.725
Uh-huh.

01:03:20.825 --> 01:03:22.628
Even the weird ones
get girlfriends.

01:03:22.728 --> 01:03:23.728
That's right.

01:03:23.828 --> 01:03:26.231
Meat Loaf definitely
got laid at least once.

01:03:26.331 --> 01:03:27.487
For God's sake,

01:03:27.587 --> 01:03:30.110
Ringo Starr married
a Bond girl.

01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:32.126
Whatever. There's
this big concert...

01:03:32.226 --> 01:03:34.196
at the end of term
and Joanna's in it.

01:03:34.296 --> 01:03:36.599
I thought if I
was in the band...

01:03:36.699 --> 01:03:38.075
and played superbly,

01:03:38.175 --> 01:03:40.067
she might fall
in love with me.

01:03:40.167 --> 01:03:41.245
What do you think?

01:03:41.345 --> 01:03:44.165
I think it's brilliant,
I think it's stellar.

01:03:44.265 --> 01:03:48.127
Apart from the one obvious
tiny little baby little hiccup.

01:03:48.227 --> 01:03:50.952
I don't play a
musical instrument?

01:03:51.052 --> 01:03:52.256
Yes, sir.

01:03:52.356 --> 01:03:54.466
A tiny, insignificant detail.

01:03:59.215 --> 01:04:00.139
You look into my eyes

01:04:00.239 --> 01:04:02.908
I go out of my mind

01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:04.950
I can't see anything

01:04:04.994 --> 01:04:07.538
Cos this love's got me blind

01:04:07.621 --> 01:04:10.416
I can't help myself

01:04:10.499 --> 01:04:12.150
I can't break this spell

01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:15.878
I can't even try

01:04:17.130 --> 01:04:21.676
Baby, I'm too lost in you

01:04:21.759 --> 01:04:23.928
Caught in you

01:04:24.012 --> 01:04:27.473
Lost in everything
about you

01:04:27.557 --> 01:04:32.020
So deep I can't
sleep, I can't...

01:04:32.103 --> 01:04:34.797
I suppose I'd better
do the duty round.

01:04:34.897 --> 01:04:36.941
You're a saint.

01:04:43.948 --> 01:04:47.008
Any chance of a
dance with the boss?

01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:49.912
Yeah, sure, sure.

01:04:49.996 --> 01:04:53.310
As long as your
boyfriend doesn't mind.

01:04:55.125 --> 01:04:57.127
Not my boyfriend.

01:04:57.210 --> 01:04:59.338
And you're all I see

01:04:59.421 --> 01:05:01.923
And you're all I need

01:05:02.007 --> 01:05:04.217
Help me, baby
Help me, baby

01:05:04.252 --> 01:05:05.661
Help me, baby

01:05:05.761 --> 01:05:11.099
Oh baby, I'm too lost in you

01:05:11.141 --> 01:05:12.334
Caught in you...

01:05:12.434 --> 01:05:15.409
You're looking very
pretty tonight.

01:05:16.813 --> 01:05:18.857
It's for you.

01:05:20.317 --> 01:05:22.361
Sorry?

01:05:24.821 --> 01:05:26.990
It's all for you, sir.

01:05:28.909 --> 01:05:30.727
You do

01:05:30.827 --> 01:05:33.955
I'm too lost in you
Baby, baby

01:05:34.038 --> 01:05:38.209
Baby, I'm too lost in you
Yeah, yeah

01:05:38.292 --> 01:05:40.711
Caught in you

01:05:40.795 --> 01:05:43.965
Lost in everything
about you

01:05:44.048 --> 01:05:48.135
So deep I can't sleep...

01:05:49.303 --> 01:05:51.497
'This must be very
exciting for you,

01:05:51.597 --> 01:05:53.916
fighting for the
Christmas number one.

01:05:54.016 --> 01:05:57.086
'How's it looking so far? '
- 'Very bad indeed.

01:05:57.186 --> 01:06:00.416
'Blue are outselling
me five to one...

01:06:00.439 --> 01:06:03.484
'but I'm hoping
for a late surge.

01:06:03.567 --> 01:06:06.570
'And, if I reach number one,

01:06:06.654 --> 01:06:10.305
'I promise to sing a
song stark naked...

01:06:10.405 --> 01:06:12.575
on TV on Christmas Eve. '

01:06:13.743 --> 01:06:16.396
'Do you mean that? '
- 'Of course I do, Michael.

01:06:16.496 --> 01:06:19.524
'Do you want a preview?
You old flirt. '

01:06:23.086 --> 01:06:25.155
'That'll never
make number one. '

01:06:28.341 --> 01:06:31.745
And I burn every track
Clipse and J Timberlake...

01:06:31.845 --> 01:06:33.334
I suppose it's his job...

01:06:33.434 --> 01:06:35.415
to dance with
everyone, isn't it?

01:06:35.515 --> 01:06:37.684
Some more than others.

01:06:40.937 --> 01:06:43.106
Just one dance?

01:06:43.189 --> 01:06:45.551
Before we run
out of chances.

01:06:45.651 --> 01:06:46.635
Who, me?

01:06:46.735 --> 01:06:50.905
Unless you just...
- No. No. Good.

01:06:50.989 --> 01:06:53.115
Yes. Thanks.

01:06:54.575 --> 01:06:55.707
You're a good girl

01:06:55.807 --> 01:06:58.646
And that's what makes
me trust you like I do

01:06:58.746 --> 01:07:01.415
Late at night I talk to you

01:07:01.457 --> 01:07:02.942
Hey

01:07:03.042 --> 01:07:05.027
You will know the
difference when...

01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:17.473
Like a flower

01:07:17.556 --> 01:07:21.602
Waiting to bloom

01:07:23.771 --> 01:07:26.523
Like a light bulb

01:07:27.733 --> 01:07:30.069
In a dark room

01:07:32.195 --> 01:07:34.906
I'm just sitting here

01:07:34.989 --> 01:07:37.700
Waiting for you

01:07:37.784 --> 01:07:40.078
To come on home

01:07:40.161 --> 01:07:42.205
And turn me on

01:07:48.127 --> 01:07:51.005
Like the desert

01:07:52.131 --> 01:07:56.886
Waiting for the rain

01:07:58.012 --> 01:08:00.556
Like a schoolkid

01:08:02.225 --> 01:08:04.978
Waiting for the spring

01:08:06.771 --> 01:08:08.548
I'm just sitting here

01:08:08.648 --> 01:08:13.652
Waiting for you
to come on home

01:08:13.735 --> 01:08:16.947
And turn me on

01:08:17.029 --> 01:08:21.952
Turn me on

01:08:22.035 --> 01:08:24.245
Well, then. I'd better go.

01:08:24.287 --> 01:08:26.331
OK.

01:08:27.707 --> 01:08:29.917
Good night.
- Good night.

01:08:47.102 --> 01:08:49.145
Actually...

01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:51.506
I don't have to go.
- Right. Good.

01:08:51.606 --> 01:08:53.901
I mean...
- No, that's good.

01:08:54.734 --> 01:08:57.109
Just, erm, would
you excuse me...

01:08:57.210 --> 01:08:58.261
for one second?

01:08:58.362 --> 01:09:01.032
Sure.
- Just one second.

01:09:08.456 --> 01:09:11.834
Erm, OK, that's done. Erm...

01:09:13.461 --> 01:09:15.462
Why don't you
come upstairs...

01:09:15.562 --> 01:09:16.948
in about ten seconds?

01:09:17.048 --> 01:09:19.300
Ten seconds.
- Ten seconds.

01:09:44.115 --> 01:09:48.370
For you

01:09:49.621 --> 01:09:54.417
There'll be no crying

01:09:56.670 --> 01:10:02.801
For you

01:10:04.427 --> 01:10:09.182
The sun will be shining

01:10:09.599 --> 01:10:14.812
Cos I feel that
when I'm with you

01:10:15.938 --> 01:10:19.733
It's all right...

01:10:19.817 --> 01:10:22.278
Just tug it.
- OK.

01:10:22.361 --> 01:10:27.700
I know it's right

01:10:27.783 --> 01:10:31.328
And the songbirds

01:10:31.412 --> 01:10:40.337
Keep singing like
they know the score

01:10:40.421 --> 01:10:43.657
And I love you, I love
you, I love you...

01:10:43.757 --> 01:10:46.468
You're beautiful.

01:10:46.552 --> 01:10:50.931
Like never before...

01:11:09.782 --> 01:11:12.035
I- I'd better answer that.

01:11:16.331 --> 01:11:19.500
Hello. Hi. Hello, darling.

01:11:19.584 --> 01:11:22.644
No, no, I'm not
busy. No, fire away.

01:11:23.671 --> 01:11:25.490
Right.

01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:29.577
Yes, I... I'm not quite sure
it's gonna be possible...

01:11:29.677 --> 01:11:33.331
to get the Pope on the
phone tonight but...

01:11:33.513 --> 01:11:37.162
Yes. Yes, I'm sure
he's very good...

01:11:37.262 --> 01:11:39.262
at exorcism but...

01:11:42.564 --> 01:11:45.025
Well, I'm sure...

01:11:45.108 --> 01:11:46.723
Jon Bon Jovi is as well...

01:11:46.823 --> 01:11:48.887
and I'll definitely
look into it.

01:11:48.987 --> 01:11:52.532
OK? OK, I'll talk
to you later.

01:11:52.616 --> 01:11:54.660
All right, bye-bye.

01:12:00.082 --> 01:12:03.961
Sorry about that.
- No, it's fine.

01:12:04.044 --> 01:12:08.039
It's my brother, he's
not well, he calls a lot.

01:12:09.007 --> 01:12:11.451
I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine. It's fine.

01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:14.871
I mean, it's not really
fine, it is what it is,

01:12:14.971 --> 01:12:17.050
and there being
no parents now...

01:12:17.150 --> 01:12:18.583
and us being over here,

01:12:18.683 --> 01:12:21.001
it's my job to keep
an eye on him.

01:12:21.101 --> 01:12:24.046
Not my job, obviously,
I'm glad to do it...

01:12:24.146 --> 01:12:26.197
That's OK. Life is full...

01:12:26.297 --> 01:12:29.272
of interruptions
and complications.

01:12:31.570 --> 01:12:33.570
So...

01:12:50.089 --> 01:12:52.132
Will it make him better?

01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:55.285
No.

01:12:55.385 --> 01:12:57.429
Then maybe...

01:12:58.221 --> 01:13:00.265
don't answer.

01:13:07.772 --> 01:13:10.317
Hey. How you doing?

01:13:11.067 --> 01:13:14.029
Right, right. Oh, no, please.

01:13:14.112 --> 01:13:17.349
Oh, please, please
don't, little darling.

01:13:17.449 --> 01:13:20.385
Between the two of us
we'll find the answer...

01:13:20.485 --> 01:13:22.187
and it won't hurt any more.

01:13:22.287 --> 01:13:24.287
No, no.

01:13:24.331 --> 01:13:26.374
I'm-I'm not busy. I...

01:13:28.043 --> 01:13:32.462
Of course, if you want me
to come over I will. Mm-hm.

01:13:33.088 --> 01:13:35.088
OK.

01:13:43.933 --> 01:13:46.769
That was a good night.

01:13:46.852 --> 01:13:49.505
Except I felt fat.
- Don't be ridiculous.

01:13:49.605 --> 01:13:51.215
It's true.

01:13:51.315 --> 01:13:53.746
Nowadays the only
clothes I can get into...

01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:55.469
were once owned
by Pavarotti.

01:13:55.569 --> 01:13:59.224
I always think Pavarotti
dresses very well.

01:14:02.034 --> 01:14:04.078
Mia's very pretty.

01:14:05.996 --> 01:14:08.040
Is she?

01:14:09.458 --> 01:14:12.460
You know she is, darling.

01:14:12.543 --> 01:14:14.712
Be careful there.

01:14:37.986 --> 01:14:40.961
Have you been
watching stuff on TV?

01:14:42.115 --> 01:14:44.659
Yeah.

01:14:44.742 --> 01:14:46.742
Every night.
- Good.

01:14:46.786 --> 01:14:48.913
And every day.

01:14:55.877 --> 01:14:58.716
The nurses are
trying to kill me.

01:14:58.816 --> 01:15:01.742
Nobody's trying to
kill you, babe.

01:15:06.930 --> 01:15:08.974
Thank you.

01:15:11.727 --> 01:15:14.187
Don't do that, my darling.

01:15:16.523 --> 01:15:18.567
Thank you.

01:15:25.657 --> 01:15:27.784
Don't do that.

01:16:00.483 --> 01:16:03.281
Right. Back at three.
Christmas shopping,

01:16:03.381 --> 01:16:04.929
never easy or pleasant.

01:16:05.029 --> 01:16:07.907
Are you gonna
get me something?

01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:10.034
Er...

01:16:11.576 --> 01:16:13.603
I don't know, I
hadn't thought.

01:16:13.703 --> 01:16:15.522
Where's Sarah, by the way?

01:16:15.622 --> 01:16:18.358
She couldn't make it
in. Family thing.

01:16:18.458 --> 01:16:20.365
There's a word
for hangover

01:16:20.465 --> 01:16:22.154
I've never heard before.

01:16:22.254 --> 01:16:26.383
See you later.
- Yes. Looking forward to it.

01:16:29.803 --> 01:16:31.846
A lot.

01:16:43.942 --> 01:16:46.662
Are you gonna give
me something?

01:16:47.153 --> 01:16:49.848
I thought I made it
clear last night.

01:16:49.948 --> 01:16:53.687
When it comes to me,
you can have everything.

01:16:53.742 --> 01:16:57.204
So, erm, what do you need?

01:16:58.497 --> 01:17:00.763
Something along the
stationery line?

01:17:00.863 --> 01:17:02.485
Are you short of staplers?

01:17:02.585 --> 01:17:06.005
No. I don't want
something I need.

01:17:06.088 --> 01:17:09.658
I want something I
want. Something pretty.

01:17:10.718 --> 01:17:12.718
Right.

01:17:13.721 --> 01:17:15.764
Right.

01:17:23.147 --> 01:17:25.902
Sorry I'm late,
I had to drop off

01:17:26.002 --> 01:17:28.002
Bernie at rehearsal.

01:17:30.779 --> 01:17:33.389
Right, listen, you keep
yourself occupied...

01:17:33.489 --> 01:17:37.229
while I do the boring
stuff for our mothers.

01:17:58.598 --> 01:18:00.725
Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:18:00.808 --> 01:18:03.503
Looking for anything
in particular, sir?

01:18:03.603 --> 01:18:07.231
Yes. That necklace
there, how much is it?

01:18:07.315 --> 01:18:09.484
It's 270.

01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:14.947
Erm, all right. Er, I'll have it.
- Lovely.

01:18:17.991 --> 01:18:21.078
Would you like i
t... giftwrapped?

01:18:21.161 --> 01:18:23.914
Yes, all right.
- Lovely.

01:18:27.042 --> 01:18:29.592
Let me just pop
it in the box.

01:18:30.963 --> 01:18:32.364
There.

01:18:32.464 --> 01:18:34.794
Look, could we
be quite quick?

01:18:34.894 --> 01:18:36.034
Certainly, sir.

01:18:36.134 --> 01:18:39.024
Ready in the
flashiest of flashes.

01:18:46.478 --> 01:18:48.088
There.
- That's great.

01:18:48.188 --> 01:18:50.983
Not quite finished.

01:18:54.527 --> 01:18:57.427
I don't need a bag, I'll
put it in my pocket.

01:18:57.527 --> 01:18:59.182
Oh, this isn't a bag, sir.

01:18:59.282 --> 01:19:00.282
Really?

01:19:00.382 --> 01:19:03.102
This is so much
more than a bag.

01:19:09.458 --> 01:19:11.460
Ooh.

01:19:25.891 --> 01:19:28.252
Could we be quite
quick, please?

01:19:28.352 --> 01:19:31.105
Prontissimo.

01:19:49.414 --> 01:19:52.108
What's that?
- A cinnamon stick, sir.

01:19:52.208 --> 01:19:55.695
Actually, I really can't wait.
- You won't regret it, sir.

01:19:55.795 --> 01:19:58.048
Want to bet?

01:19:58.131 --> 01:20:00.681
'Tis but the work
of a moment.

01:20:04.054 --> 01:20:06.289
There we go.
Almost finished.

01:20:06.389 --> 01:20:08.527
Are you gonna
dip it in yogurt?

01:20:08.627 --> 01:20:10.836
Cover it with
chocolate buttons?

01:20:10.936 --> 01:20:12.761
No, sir, we're
going to pop it...

01:20:12.861 --> 01:20:14.004
in the Christmas box.

01:20:14.104 --> 01:20:15.673
I don't want a
Christmas box.

01:20:15.773 --> 01:20:17.677
But you wanted
it giftwrapped.

01:20:17.777 --> 01:20:18.509
I did but...

01:20:18.609 --> 01:20:20.344
The final flourish.
- Can I pay?

01:20:20.444 --> 01:20:23.155
All we need now...
- Oh, God.

01:20:23.239 --> 01:20:25.391
...is a sprig of holly.
- No, no, no, no.

01:20:25.491 --> 01:20:27.476
No bloody holly.
- But sir...

01:20:27.576 --> 01:20:30.246
Leave it.
- Ooh.

01:20:30.329 --> 01:20:32.509
Loitering around the
jewellery section?

01:20:32.609 --> 01:20:34.275
No. I was just
looking around.

01:20:34.375 --> 01:20:35.912
Don't worry. My
expectations...

01:20:36.012 --> 01:20:36.986
are not that high...

01:20:37.086 --> 01:20:38.286
after 13 years of

01:20:38.386 --> 01:20:40.698
Mr Oh-But-You-Alw
ays-Love-Scarves.

01:20:40.798 --> 01:20:42.825
Actually, I do love this one.

01:20:45.177 --> 01:20:47.346
I've gotta know

01:20:47.429 --> 01:20:53.559
Where do the lonely
hearts go...

01:20:53.643 --> 01:20:56.980
Hey.
- What are you doing here?

01:20:57.063 --> 01:21:00.049
Had to rent out my flat
to pay for my ticket.

01:21:00.149 --> 01:21:02.115
You're not actually
going ahead...

01:21:02.215 --> 01:21:03.469
with this stupid plan?

01:21:03.569 --> 01:21:05.263
I bloody am.

01:21:05.363 --> 01:21:07.542
You think this is
full of clothes?

01:21:07.642 --> 01:21:08.641
Like hell it is.

01:21:08.741 --> 01:21:11.801
It is chock-a-block
full of condoms.

01:21:11.869 --> 01:21:15.273
Excellent. Excellent.
Perfect, keep that going.

01:21:15.373 --> 01:21:17.753
Look, erm...

01:21:19.002 --> 01:21:21.529
sorry to be a bit forward
and all that but...

01:21:21.629 --> 01:21:24.250
you don't fancy going
for a Christmas drink,

01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:26.242
do you? I mean,
nothing implied.

01:21:26.342 --> 01:21:29.386
Just maybe go
and see something

01:21:29.486 --> 01:21:31.930
Christmassy or something.

01:21:32.014 --> 01:21:33.871
Obviously, if you
don't want to,

01:21:33.971 --> 01:21:35.292
you don't have to. I...

01:21:35.392 --> 01:21:37.085
I'm rambling now, sorry.

01:21:37.185 --> 01:21:39.855
No. That would be lovely.

01:21:39.938 --> 01:21:42.274
Oh, great.

01:21:44.651 --> 01:21:45.928
Yay.

01:21:46.028 --> 01:21:48.138
You know, that
is really great.

01:21:48.238 --> 01:21:50.829
Normally, I'm really
shy, takes me ages...

01:21:50.929 --> 01:21:53.143
to get the courage
up, so thank you.

01:21:59.750 --> 01:22:02.533
Explain again why
you're so late.

01:22:02.633 --> 01:22:05.098
Can't a man have
any secrets?

01:22:05.172 --> 01:22:07.257
We've been
waiting for hours,

01:22:07.357 --> 01:22:09.368
it's the first ever preview.

01:22:09.468 --> 01:22:11.592
...is a thing of the past

01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:14.956
Maybe you can bring
us all hope this year

01:22:15.056 --> 01:22:18.000
Visions of sugarplums
have disappeared...

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:22.129
It was a starry night
in ancient Jerusalem...

01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:25.399
and the baby Jesus
was in his manger.

01:22:33.532 --> 01:22:37.203
Sherlock Holmes is
not a real detective.

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:40.273
Is this the
way to the train station?

01:22:40.373 --> 01:22:43.501
I would like
half-pint of churly.

01:22:44.627 --> 01:22:47.280
I would like a
one-day Travelcard.

01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:48.932
Oh, my God,

01:22:49.032 --> 01:22:51.117
I've got a terrible
stomachache.

01:22:51.217 --> 01:22:53.451
It must have
been the prawns.

01:22:53.551 --> 01:22:56.526
Milton Keynes has
many roundabouts.

01:22:57.264 --> 01:23:01.434
My goodness,
this is a very big fish.

01:23:01.518 --> 01:23:04.521
It tastes delicious.

01:23:04.604 --> 01:23:06.256
All alone on Christmas

01:23:06.356 --> 01:23:08.967
Nobody ought to be
alone on Christmas

01:23:09.067 --> 01:23:10.473
All alone on Christmas

01:23:10.573 --> 01:23:12.971
Nobody ought to be
alone on Christmas

01:23:13.071 --> 01:23:14.556
Tell me I've got to know

01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:17.477
Nobody ought to be
alone on Christmas

01:23:17.577 --> 01:23:19.311
Don't leave me alone...

01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:21.515
You'll come back
a broken man.

01:23:21.615 --> 01:23:24.149
Yeah, back broken
from too much sex.

01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:26.568
You are on the
road to disaster.

01:23:26.668 --> 01:23:30.130
No, I am on shag
highway, heading west.

01:23:30.755 --> 01:23:32.754
Farewell, failure.

01:23:32.798 --> 01:23:36.719
America, watch out.
Here comes Colin Frissell.

01:23:36.802 --> 01:23:40.347
And he's got a big knob...

01:23:41.473 --> 01:23:43.858
(Santana Featuring
Rob Thomas:

01:23:43.958 --> 01:23:45.958
Smooth)...

01:23:51.108 --> 01:23:53.636
Take me to a bar.
- What kind of bar?

01:23:53.736 --> 01:23:54.791
Just any bar.

01:23:54.891 --> 01:23:57.526
Just your average
American bar.

01:23:57.907 --> 01:24:00.784
(On jukebo Man,
it's a hot one

01:24:00.868 --> 01:24:04.183
Like seven inches
from the midday sun...

01:24:04.246 --> 01:24:05.340
Can I help you?

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.983
Yes. I'd like a
Budweiser, please.

01:24:08.083 --> 01:24:11.461
King of beers.
- Bud coming up.

01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:14.672
Oh, my God.

01:24:14.756 --> 01:24:16.756
Are you from England?

01:24:18.301 --> 01:24:20.720
Yes.
- Oh...

01:24:20.803 --> 01:24:23.765
that is so cute.

01:24:23.848 --> 01:24:27.518
Hi, I'm Stacey.

01:24:27.602 --> 01:24:29.646
Jeannie?

01:24:31.564 --> 01:24:33.650
Yeah?

01:24:33.733 --> 01:24:36.486
This is...
- Colin.

01:24:38.029 --> 01:24:40.240
Frissell.

01:24:40.323 --> 01:24:42.408
Cute name.

01:24:42.492 --> 01:24:45.286
Jeannie.
- He's from England.

01:24:45.370 --> 01:24:47.580
Yep. Basildon.

01:24:47.664 --> 01:24:50.541
Oh.
- Oh.

01:24:50.625 --> 01:24:53.027
Wait till Carol-Anne
gets here.

01:24:53.127 --> 01:24:55.529
She's crazy about
English guys.

01:24:55.629 --> 01:24:57.756
Uh-huh.

01:25:00.842 --> 01:25:01.910
Hey, girls.

01:25:02.010 --> 01:25:04.805
Carol-Anne, come
meet Colin.

01:25:04.888 --> 01:25:07.474
He's from England.

01:25:07.557 --> 01:25:11.770
Well, step aside,
ladies. This one's on me.

01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:17.490
Hey, gorgeous.

01:25:19.278 --> 01:25:21.363
That is so funny.

01:25:22.739 --> 01:25:25.058
What do you call that?
- Er, bottle.

01:25:25.158 --> 01:25:27.227
'Bottle. '

01:25:27.327 --> 01:25:29.354
What about this?
- Er, straw.

01:25:29.454 --> 01:25:31.273
'Straw. '

01:25:31.372 --> 01:25:33.412
What about this?
- Table.

01:25:34.625 --> 01:25:36.652
Table. The same.
- Oh, it's the same.

01:25:36.752 --> 01:25:40.114
Where are you staying?
- I don't actually know.

01:25:40.214 --> 01:25:42.992
I'll just check into a
motel like in the movies.

01:25:43.092 --> 01:25:46.370
Oh, my God. Oh, my
God, that is so cute.

01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:49.421
No, no, no, listen. This
may be a bit pushy...

01:25:49.521 --> 01:25:51.167
cos we just met you but...

01:25:51.267 --> 01:25:53.753
why don't you come back
and sleep at our place?

01:25:53.853 --> 01:25:55.980
Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:25:56.063 --> 01:25:59.008
Well, if it's not too much
of an inconvenience.

01:25:59.108 --> 01:26:02.111
Hell no.
- But there's one problem.

01:26:02.194 --> 01:26:04.280
What?

01:26:04.363 --> 01:26:06.875
Well, we're not the
richest of girls,

01:26:06.975 --> 01:26:07.975
you know.

01:26:08.075 --> 01:26:13.038
So we just have a little
bed and no couch.

01:26:13.121 --> 01:26:16.441
So you'd have to share
with all three of us.

01:26:16.541 --> 01:26:20.397
And on this cold, cold
night it's gonna be...

01:26:20.497 --> 01:26:22.964
crowded and
sweaty and stuff.

01:26:23.048 --> 01:26:25.853
And we can't even
afford pyjamas.

01:26:25.884 --> 01:26:28.261
No?

01:26:28.345 --> 01:26:30.847
Which means...

01:26:30.931 --> 01:26:33.099
we would be naked.

01:26:37.812 --> 01:26:39.422
No, no, I think it'd be fine.

01:26:39.522 --> 01:26:41.900
Great.
- Erm...

01:26:41.983 --> 01:26:43.953
The thing that's
gonna make it...

01:26:44.053 --> 01:26:45.053
more crowded...

01:26:45.153 --> 01:26:47.305
Harriet. You
haven't met Harriet.

01:26:47.405 --> 01:26:49.224
There's a fourth?
- Yeah.

01:26:49.324 --> 01:26:51.985
Don't worry, you're
totally gonna like her...

01:26:52.085 --> 01:26:53.602
cos she is 'the sexy one'.

01:26:53.702 --> 01:26:56.455
Really? Wow.
- Yeah.

01:26:56.538 --> 01:27:00.376
Praise the Lord.
- Oh, and he's a Christian.

01:27:02.878 --> 01:27:04.488
Cheers.

01:27:04.588 --> 01:27:07.091
If I could

01:27:07.174 --> 01:27:09.301
Then I would

01:27:09.385 --> 01:27:13.555
I'll go wherever you will go

01:27:13.639 --> 01:27:15.641
Way up high

01:27:15.724 --> 01:27:17.768
Or down low

01:27:17.851 --> 01:27:22.022
I'll go wherever you will go

01:27:22.106 --> 01:27:25.484
If I could turn back...

01:27:25.568 --> 01:27:27.361
One present only
each tonight.

01:27:27.461 --> 01:27:28.762
Who's got one for Dad?

01:27:28.862 --> 01:27:30.806
I have.
- Let Mummy go first.

01:27:30.906 --> 01:27:31.905
I'll get it.

01:27:32.005 --> 01:27:34.017
No, no, no. I want
to choose mine.

01:27:34.117 --> 01:27:36.369
I think I want...

01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:39.580
...this one.

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:42.317
I have bought the
traditional scarf as well...

01:27:42.417 --> 01:27:43.944
but this is my other,

01:27:44.044 --> 01:27:46.321
slightly special,
personal one.

01:27:46.421 --> 01:27:48.548
Thank you.

01:27:48.631 --> 01:27:50.717
That's a real first.

01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:53.219
Rip it.
- What is it?

01:27:53.303 --> 01:27:56.618
I'm going to... All
right, I'll rip it.

01:28:02.437 --> 01:28:04.814
God, that's a surprise.

01:28:06.107 --> 01:28:08.107
What is it?

01:28:09.777 --> 01:28:13.447
It's a CD. Joni
Mitchell, wow.

01:28:13.530 --> 01:28:15.849
To continue your
emotional education.

01:28:15.949 --> 01:28:18.118
Yes.

01:28:18.201 --> 01:28:20.662
Goodness.

01:28:20.746 --> 01:28:22.746
That's great.

01:28:22.789 --> 01:28:25.709
My brilliant wife.
- Ah, yes.

01:28:28.003 --> 01:28:31.182
Actually, do you mind if
I just absent myself...

01:28:31.282 --> 01:28:32.282
for a second?

01:28:32.382 --> 01:28:35.260
All that ice cream. Er...

01:28:35.344 --> 01:28:37.085
Darling, could
you make sure...

01:28:37.185 --> 01:28:38.580
the kids are ready to go?

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:39.680
Back in a minute.

01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:42.084
All
right, take it easy.

01:28:42.184 --> 01:28:44.394
Mine first. Mine.

01:28:44.561 --> 01:28:46.335
(Joni Mitchell:
Both Sides No

01:28:46.435 --> 01:28:47.297
Moons and Junes

01:28:47.397 --> 01:28:49.775
And Ferris wheels

01:28:51.276 --> 01:28:56.489
The dizzy dancing
way that you feel

01:28:56.572 --> 01:29:01.619
As every fairy
tale comes real

01:29:04.038 --> 01:29:06.499
I've looked at love that way

01:29:10.169 --> 01:29:13.798
But now it's just
another show

01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:20.596
And you leave 'em
laughing when you go

01:29:22.014 --> 01:29:24.725
And if you care

01:29:24.809 --> 01:29:26.978
Don't let them know

01:29:28.813 --> 01:29:32.023
Don't give yourself away

01:29:34.859 --> 01:29:37.153
I've looked at love

01:29:37.237 --> 01:29:40.115
From both sides now

01:29:40.198 --> 01:29:42.284
From give and take

01:29:43.535 --> 01:29:46.705
And still somehow

01:29:46.788 --> 01:29:52.002
It's love's illusions
that I recall

01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:56.339
I really don't know love

01:30:00.677 --> 01:30:03.388
I really don't
know love at all

01:30:15.149 --> 01:30:17.401
Tears and fears

01:30:17.484 --> 01:30:20.279
And feeling proud

01:30:21.405 --> 01:30:26.452
To say I love you
right out loud

01:30:27.578 --> 01:30:30.247
Dreams and schemes

01:30:30.331 --> 01:30:33.125
And circus crowds

01:30:34.501 --> 01:30:37.546
I've looked at life that way

01:30:39.048 --> 01:30:41.216
Oh but now old friends...

01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:42.910
Oh, my God.

01:30:43.010 --> 01:30:46.055
It's a miracle.
You're all dressed.

01:30:46.138 --> 01:30:47.799
Come on, come
on, come on,

01:30:47.899 --> 01:30:49.166
we're horribly late.

01:30:49.266 --> 01:30:52.495
Come on, then. In
the car. In the car.

01:30:52.936 --> 01:30:55.730
Well something's lost

01:30:55.813 --> 01:30:57.813
But something's gained

01:30:59.108 --> 01:31:02.403
In living every day...

01:31:02.695 --> 01:31:05.740
Has she noticed you yet?
- No.

01:31:05.823 --> 01:31:08.080
But the thing about
romance is people...

01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:10.436
only get together
right at the very end.

01:31:10.536 --> 01:31:12.705
Of course.

01:31:13.831 --> 01:31:16.074
By the way, I feel bad.
I never ask you...

01:31:16.174 --> 01:31:17.652
how your love life is going.

01:31:17.752 --> 01:31:19.752
Er-huh.

01:31:19.796 --> 01:31:21.573
No.

01:31:21.673 --> 01:31:22.673
As you know,

01:31:22.773 --> 01:31:25.323
that was a done
deal long ago.

01:31:25.927 --> 01:31:28.598
Unless Claudia Schiffer
calls, in which case

01:31:28.698 --> 01:31:30.874
I want you out of
here straightaway,

01:31:30.974 --> 01:31:33.084
you wee motherless
mongrel.

01:31:33.184 --> 01:31:34.168
Oh.

01:31:34.268 --> 01:31:36.553
No, no. We'll want
to have sex...

01:31:36.653 --> 01:31:38.797
in every room,
including yours.

01:31:39.997 --> 01:31:41.925
'It's a rainy Christmas
Eve all over the UK...

01:31:42.025 --> 01:31:44.143
'and the question is
who is number one...

01:31:44.243 --> 01:31:46.096

chart show tonight?

'Ls it Blue or the unexpected

'You might have guessed it...

01:31:52.128 --> 01:31:54.104
although you may
not believe it.

01:31:54.204 --> 01:31:56.415
'It's Billy Mack. '

01:31:58.625 --> 01:32:01.278
You are the champion.
- Shh.

01:32:01.378 --> 01:32:03.378
'Hi, Billy. '
- Hello.

01:32:03.422 --> 01:32:07.201
'We're live across the nation

01:32:07.301 --> 01:32:09.043
'How will you be
celebrating? '

01:32:09.143 --> 01:32:09.870
I don't know.

01:32:09.970 --> 01:32:11.630
Er, either I could
behave like...

01:32:11.730 --> 01:32:13.080
a real rock'n'roll loser...

01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:15.917
and get drunk with
my fat manager...

01:32:16.017 --> 01:32:18.102
or, when I hang up,

01:32:18.185 --> 01:32:20.364
I'll be flooded by invitations...

01:32:20.464 --> 01:32:23.049
to a large number of
glamorous parties.

01:32:23.149 --> 01:32:25.224
'Let's hope it's the
latter. Here it is.

Oh, Jesus, not
that crap again.

01:32:31.157 --> 01:32:33.826
I feel it in my fingers...

01:32:33.868 --> 01:32:36.329
Bill, it's for you, babe.

01:32:37.371 --> 01:32:39.832
Hello. Elton.

01:32:39.916 --> 01:32:43.377
O- Of course. Of course.

01:32:43.461 --> 01:32:45.586
Send an embarrassingly
big car...

01:32:45.686 --> 01:32:46.823
and I'll be there.

01:32:48.674 --> 01:32:52.344
It's gonna be a very
good Christmas.

01:33:00.352 --> 01:33:01.352
Right.

01:33:01.452 --> 01:33:03.088
I'd better be getting
inside, actually.

01:33:03.188 --> 01:33:04.589
My mum and... you know.

01:33:04.689 --> 01:33:07.342
Of course, yeah. It's
getting a bit cold.

01:33:07.442 --> 01:33:09.903
Erm...

01:33:09.986 --> 01:33:12.781
Well, good night.
- Night.

01:33:15.408 --> 01:33:17.408
Er...

01:33:22.707 --> 01:33:25.752
Er... OK.

01:33:38.514 --> 01:33:41.183
All I want for Christmas...

01:33:41.267 --> 01:33:44.728
is you.

01:33:44.812 --> 01:33:47.398
Right.

01:33:47.481 --> 01:33:50.484
Thank you. Good.

01:33:50.568 --> 01:33:52.568
Good night.

01:33:53.571 --> 01:33:56.865
Ha ha ha. Ho.

01:33:59.750 --> 01:34:01.750
I'm, I'm dreaming

01:34:02.496 --> 01:34:06.083
Dreaming of a white...

01:34:06.166 --> 01:34:08.736
Oh, look, everyone,
it's Uncle Jamie.

01:34:08.836 --> 01:34:11.671
Hi, Uncle Jamie.

01:34:11.754 --> 01:34:16.009
Yes, oh, splendid. It's
lovely to see you all.

01:34:16.092 --> 01:34:18.553
And, er...

01:34:19.679 --> 01:34:20.997
I'm off, actually.

01:34:21.097 --> 01:34:23.975
But Jamie, darling.

01:34:24.058 --> 01:34:26.603
Sorry.

01:34:26.686 --> 01:34:29.831
Man's gotta do what
a man's gotta do.

01:34:32.442 --> 01:34:34.442
I hate Uncle Jamie.

01:34:34.444 --> 01:34:37.680
I hate Uncle Jamie.
I hate Uncle Jamie.

01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:39.908
And try to listen

01:34:41.659 --> 01:34:44.704
To hear

01:34:44.787 --> 01:34:47.081
Hear for the sleigh bells

01:34:47.165 --> 01:34:49.192
That are ringing
in the snow...

01:34:49.292 --> 01:34:52.776
Gatwick airport,
please. Fast as you can.

01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:59.051
I- I-I

01:35:00.135 --> 01:35:02.179
I'm dreaming

01:35:04.223 --> 01:35:06.934
Of a white...

01:35:07.017 --> 01:35:09.770
Night, Sarah.
- Night, Karl.

01:35:10.729 --> 01:35:12.773
I, er...

01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:19.750
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:35:24.368 --> 01:35:27.829
I want you to
know, may your day

01:35:27.913 --> 01:35:31.083
May your day

01:35:31.166 --> 01:35:35.503
Be so merry, merry
and bright...

01:35:40.132 --> 01:35:43.135
Hi, babe, how's
it going? Yeah.

01:35:43.219 --> 01:35:45.830
Is it all party, party,
party down there?

01:35:45.930 --> 01:35:48.015
All of your Christmases

01:35:49.141 --> 01:35:51.686
And may all

01:35:51.769 --> 01:35:55.106
And may all of
your Christmases

01:35:56.649 --> 01:35:58.468
Baby may your days

01:35:58.568 --> 01:36:02.280
May your days be merry

01:36:02.363 --> 01:36:04.574
Merry, so merry...

01:36:04.657 --> 01:36:07.768
Sam, time for dinner.
- I'm not hungry.

01:36:07.868 --> 01:36:11.329
Sam, I've done
chicken kebabs.

01:36:11.413 --> 01:36:13.565
Look at the
sign on the door.

01:36:17.752 --> 01:36:19.796
Right.

01:36:25.594 --> 01:36:28.305
It's a little long.

01:36:28.388 --> 01:36:29.456
Dreaming,

01:36:29.556 --> 01:36:34.352
dreaming of a white,
white Christmas...

01:36:36.479 --> 01:36:38.523
I'll get it.

01:36:44.738 --> 01:36:47.699
Oh, hi.
- Who is it?

01:36:52.244 --> 01:36:54.104
It's carol singers.

01:36:54.204 --> 01:36:56.273
Give them a quid and
tell them to bugger off.

01:37:00.002 --> 01:37:04.882
Silent night

01:37:04.965 --> 01:37:09.345
Holy night

01:37:09.428 --> 01:37:13.849
All is calm

01:37:13.933 --> 01:37:18.354
All is bright

01:37:18.437 --> 01:37:22.983
Round yon virgin

01:37:23.067 --> 01:37:27.404
Mother and child

01:37:27.488 --> 01:37:31.532
Holy infant

01:37:31.616 --> 01:37:36.204
So tender and mild

01:37:36.287 --> 01:37:44.379
Sleep in heavenly peace

01:37:45.713 --> 01:37:51.052
Sleep in heavenly peace

01:37:54.806 --> 01:37:58.893
Silent night

01:37:58.977 --> 01:38:03.439
Holy night

01:38:03.523 --> 01:38:07.777
Shepherds quake

01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:09.860
At the sight...

01:38:09.904 --> 01:38:11.972
Merry Christmas.

01:38:12.072 --> 01:38:16.326
Glories stream

01:38:16.410 --> 01:38:20.747
From heaven afar

01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:30.340
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia

01:38:30.424 --> 01:38:38.515
Christ the saviour is born

01:38:39.641 --> 01:38:45.147
Christ the saviour is born

01:38:48.191 --> 01:38:50.903
Enough.

01:38:50.986 --> 01:38:52.845
Enough now.

01:39:00.328 --> 01:39:02.422
What the hell are
you doing here?

01:39:02.522 --> 01:39:04.941
You're supposed to
be at Elton John's.

01:39:05.041 --> 01:39:08.069
Well, I was there for
a minute or two...

01:39:08.169 --> 01:39:10.196
and then I had an epiphany.

01:39:10.296 --> 01:39:12.673
Really?
- Yeah.

01:39:12.757 --> 01:39:14.842
Come on. Just come up.

01:39:14.926 --> 01:39:18.054
So what was
this epiphany?

01:39:18.137 --> 01:39:20.942
Erm, it... it was
about Christmas.

01:39:20.973 --> 01:39:23.209
You realised it
was all around.

01:39:23.309 --> 01:39:26.430
No. I realised that
Christmas is the time...

01:39:26.530 --> 01:39:28.714
to be with the
people you love.

01:39:28.814 --> 01:39:30.299
Right.

01:39:30.399 --> 01:39:33.987
And I realised that,
as dire chance...

01:39:34.087 --> 01:39:37.197
and fateful cockup
would have it,

01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:39.282
here I am,

01:39:39.366 --> 01:39:41.660
mid-fifties,

01:39:41.743 --> 01:39:42.943
and without knowing it,

01:39:43.043 --> 01:39:44.896
I've spent most of
my adult life...

01:39:44.996 --> 01:39:48.792
with a chubby
employee.

01:39:48.875 --> 01:39:51.570
And, much as it
grieves me to say it,

01:39:51.670 --> 01:39:57.425
it might be that the people
I love is, in fact...

01:39:58.552 --> 01:40:01.429
you.

01:40:02.556 --> 01:40:04.681
Well, this is a surprise.

01:40:04.724 --> 01:40:06.501
Yeah.

01:40:06.601 --> 01:40:08.837
Ten minutes at Elton
John's and you're gay?

01:40:08.937 --> 01:40:10.964
No, look. I'm serious here.

01:40:11.064 --> 01:40:13.569
I left Elton's and
a hefty number...

01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:16.886
of half-naked chicks with
their mouths open...

01:40:16.986 --> 01:40:21.282
in order to hang out
with you at Christmas.

01:40:22.866 --> 01:40:24.075
Well, Bill...

01:40:24.175 --> 01:40:28.289
It's a terrible, terrible
mistake, chubs...

01:40:32.126 --> 01:40:36.376
but you turn out to be
the fucking love of my life.

01:40:38.966 --> 01:40:40.361
And to be honest,

01:40:40.461 --> 01:40:42.926
despite all my
complaining...

01:40:44.763 --> 01:40:47.228
we have had a
wonderful life.

01:40:51.728 --> 01:40:53.728
Well...

01:40:55.231 --> 01:40:57.400
thank you.

01:40:59.110 --> 01:41:02.255
I mean, come on,
it's been an honour.

01:41:03.656 --> 01:41:06.034
I feel very proud.

01:41:06.117 --> 01:41:08.412
Oh, look, don't be a moron.

01:41:19.172 --> 01:41:22.657
Come on, let's get
pissed and watch porn.

01:41:42.069 --> 01:41:44.555
'Dear
sir, Dear David,

01:41:44.655 --> 01:41:46.781
'Merry Christmas and
I hope you have...

01:41:46.881 --> 01:41:48.058
a very happy New Year.

01:41:48.158 --> 01:41:49.040
'I'm very sorry...

01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:50.644
about the thing
that happened.

01:41:50.744 --> 01:41:53.814
'It was a very odd moment
and I feel like a prize idiot.

01:41:53.914 --> 01:41:55.774
'Particularly because...

01:41:55.874 --> 01:41:57.485
'if you can't say
it at Christmas,

01:41:57.585 --> 01:41:58.610
when can you, eh?...

01:41:58.710 --> 01:42:02.620
'I'm actually yours. With
love, your Natalie. '

01:42:22.441 --> 01:42:24.610
Jack, yeah, I need a car.

01:42:24.694 --> 01:42:26.737
Right now. Thank you.

01:42:38.374 --> 01:42:40.710
Oh, don't wait up.

01:42:44.463 --> 01:42:45.330
I'd like to go to

01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:46.783
Wandsworth,
the dodgy end.

01:42:46.883 --> 01:42:49.093
Very good, sir.

01:42:49.176 --> 01:42:52.804
Tell me how you want me

01:42:52.888 --> 01:42:56.558
I can feel it in
your heart beat

01:42:56.641 --> 01:42:59.603
I know you like
what you see...

01:42:59.686 --> 01:43:02.589
Harris Street.
What number, sir?

01:43:02.689 --> 01:43:05.071
Oh, God, it's
the longest street...

01:43:05.171 --> 01:43:07.552
in the world and I have
absolutely no idea.

01:43:07.652 --> 01:43:10.572
Wrap your love around me

01:43:10.655 --> 01:43:11.627
You're so excited

01:43:11.727 --> 01:43:13.600
I can feel you
getting hotter...

01:43:15.744 --> 01:43:17.604
Hello, does
Natalie live here?

01:43:17.704 --> 01:43:18.704
No.

01:43:18.804 --> 01:43:21.149
Right, fine, thank
you. Sorry to disturb.

01:43:21.249 --> 01:43:23.376
Here, aren't...

01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:26.796
Aren't you the
Prime Minister?

01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:30.451
Er, yes. In fact, I
am. Merry Christmas.

01:43:30.551 --> 01:43:31.534
Oh.

01:43:31.634 --> 01:43:34.010
Part of the service now.
Trying to get round...

01:43:34.110 --> 01:43:35.454
everyone by
New Year's Eve.

01:43:39.725 --> 01:43:43.020
Ah. Hello. Does
Natalie live here?

01:43:43.103 --> 01:43:45.773
No, she doesn't.
- Oh dear. OK.

01:43:45.814 --> 01:43:49.051
Are you singing carols?
- Er, no. No, I'm not.

01:43:49.151 --> 01:43:52.363
Please, sir, please.
- Please.

01:43:55.241 --> 01:43:57.059
Well, I suppose I could.

01:43:57.159 --> 01:43:59.159
Please.

01:44:00.371 --> 01:44:02.581
All right.

01:44:04.917 --> 01:44:07.878
Good King Wenceslas
looked out

01:44:07.962 --> 01:44:11.714
On the feast of Stephen...

01:44:13.655 --> 01:44:15.243
When the snow
lay round about

01:44:15.343 --> 01:44:18.763
Deep and crisp and even

01:44:18.846 --> 01:44:22.350
Brightly shone the
moon that night...

01:44:22.433 --> 01:44:24.961
Hello. Sorry to disturb.

01:44:25.061 --> 01:44:28.022
Does Natalie live here?
- No.

01:44:28.106 --> 01:44:30.233
She lives next door.

01:44:32.735 --> 01:44:35.321
Ah. Brilliant.

01:44:35.405 --> 01:44:38.349
You're not who I think
you are, are you?

01:44:38.449 --> 01:44:40.518
Yes and I'm sorry
about all the cockups.

01:44:40.618 --> 01:44:42.213
My cabinet are
absolute crap.

01:44:42.313 --> 01:44:44.022
We hope to do
better next year.

01:44:44.122 --> 01:44:46.332
Merry Christmas to you.

01:45:01.138 --> 01:45:04.933
Ah. Hello.

01:45:05.017 --> 01:45:07.269
Is, er, Natalie in?

01:45:07.352 --> 01:45:10.582
Oh, where the fuck
is my fucking coat?

01:45:11.607 --> 01:45:15.485
Oh. Hello.
- Hello.

01:45:15.569 --> 01:45:17.844
Erm, this is my
mum and my dad...

01:45:17.944 --> 01:45:20.641
and my Uncle Tony
and my Auntie Glynne.

01:45:20.741 --> 01:45:22.643
Hello.
- Very nice to meet you.

01:45:22.743 --> 01:45:26.538
And, erm... this is
the Prime Minister.

01:45:26.622 --> 01:45:29.499
Yes, we can see
that, darling.

01:45:29.583 --> 01:45:32.360
And erm, unfortunately,
we're very late.

01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:34.430
It's the school
Christmas concert,

01:45:34.530 --> 01:45:35.530
you see, David.

01:45:35.630 --> 01:45:37.979
All the local schools
have joined together,

01:45:38.079 --> 01:45:39.033
even St Basil's...

01:45:39.133 --> 01:45:40.688
Too much detail, Mum.

01:45:40.788 --> 01:45:42.954
Anyway, how can
we help, sir?

01:45:43.054 --> 01:45:46.933
Well, I... just
needed Natalie...

01:45:49.727 --> 01:45:51.771
on some state business.

01:45:51.854 --> 01:45:56.442
Oh.
- Right, yes. Of course.

01:45:56.525 --> 01:45:58.261
Right, er...

01:45:58.361 --> 01:46:01.055
Well, perhaps you should
come on later, Plumpy.

01:46:01.155 --> 01:46:02.515
Er, Natalie.

01:46:02.615 --> 01:46:05.101
I don't want to make you
late for the concert.

01:46:05.201 --> 01:46:06.793
No, it's nothing, really.

01:46:06.893 --> 01:46:08.813
Keith'll be very
disappointed.

01:46:08.913 --> 01:46:10.677
No, really, it doesn't matter.

01:46:10.777 --> 01:46:13.024
The octopus costume's
taken me months.

01:46:13.124 --> 01:46:15.110
Eight is a lot of legs, David.

01:46:15.210 --> 01:46:17.712
Mm. Erm...

01:46:19.548 --> 01:46:21.616
Listen, why don't I
give you a lift...

01:46:21.716 --> 01:46:24.024
and then we can talk about...

01:46:24.124 --> 01:46:27.524
this state business
business in the car.

01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:29.875
OK.

01:46:29.975 --> 01:46:32.811
Lovely, yes.
- Thank you.

01:46:32.894 --> 01:46:34.980
Hold tight, everybody.

01:46:41.611 --> 01:46:44.389
How far is this place?
- Just round the corner.

01:46:44.489 --> 01:46:47.158
Ah, right. Well, er...

01:46:49.119 --> 01:46:51.328
I just wanted to say...

01:46:53.289 --> 01:46:55.399
thank you for the
Christmas card.

01:46:55.499 --> 01:46:57.276
You're welcome.

01:46:57.376 --> 01:46:59.278
Look, I'm so sorry
about that day.

01:46:59.378 --> 01:47:01.370
I came in and he
slinked towards me...

01:47:01.470 --> 01:47:02.656
and there was a fire...

01:47:02.756 --> 01:47:05.329
and he's the President
of the United States...

01:47:05.429 --> 01:47:07.203
and nothing
happened, I promise.

01:47:07.303 --> 01:47:10.414
I just felt like such
a fool because...

01:47:10.514 --> 01:47:13.751
I think about you all
the time, actually.

01:47:13.851 --> 01:47:16.113
And I think you're the
man that I really...

01:47:16.213 --> 01:47:17.213
We're here.

01:47:17.313 --> 01:47:18.923
...love.
- Oh, wow.

01:47:19.023 --> 01:47:22.763
That really was just
round the corner. Er...

01:47:23.402 --> 01:47:25.446
Erm...

01:47:27.948 --> 01:47:30.159
Ow.

01:47:36.706 --> 01:47:38.958
Well, look, I...

01:47:40.752 --> 01:47:44.237
I think I'd better
not come in, you know?

01:47:44.255 --> 01:47:46.091
Nobody wants some
politician...

01:47:46.191 --> 01:47:47.784
stealing the kids' thunder.

01:47:47.884 --> 01:47:51.471
No, please come.
It'll be great.

01:47:51.554 --> 01:47:54.224
No, I'd... I'd better not.

01:47:55.350 --> 01:48:00.146
But I will be very sorry...

01:48:00.230 --> 01:48:02.315
to drive away from you.

01:48:03.816 --> 01:48:05.985
Just give me one second.

01:48:19.957 --> 01:48:21.615
John's been very
mysterious.

01:48:21.715 --> 01:48:23.068
Where did you two meet?

01:48:23.168 --> 01:48:26.255
Erm... erm...
- Um... um...

01:48:29.383 --> 01:48:31.426
No.

01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:06.419
Come on in. We can
watch from backstage.

01:49:06.502 --> 01:49:08.797
OK. Terry, I won't be long.

01:49:12.174 --> 01:49:15.036
Look, this has to be a
very secret visit, OK?

01:49:15.136 --> 01:49:17.806
Don't worry. This
was my school.

01:49:17.906 --> 01:49:20.456
I know my way
around. Come on.

01:49:22.018 --> 01:49:23.951
Look, the sheep are
ready already...

01:49:24.051 --> 01:49:25.213
and you're not even...

01:49:25.313 --> 01:49:29.317
Oh, David.
- Ah.

01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:31.693
Oh, how are you?

01:49:31.776 --> 01:49:35.822
Hi, guys. Hey, hey,
hey. You all right?

01:49:35.906 --> 01:49:38.016
What the hell are
you doing here?

01:49:38.116 --> 01:49:39.102
Well, you know...

01:49:39.202 --> 01:49:41.103
We always tell
your secretary...

01:49:41.203 --> 01:49:43.725
that these things are
going on but it never...

01:49:43.825 --> 01:49:45.899
occurred to me you'd
actually turn up.

01:49:45.999 --> 01:49:47.859
I thought it was time I did.

01:49:47.959 --> 01:49:49.590
I didn't want anyone to see,

01:49:49.690 --> 01:49:51.321
so I'm gonna
hide somewhere.

01:49:51.421 --> 01:49:53.824
Good luck, Daisy,
good luck, Bernie.

01:49:53.924 --> 01:49:55.621
I've never been gladder...

01:49:55.721 --> 01:49:57.619
to see my stupid
big brother.

01:49:57.719 --> 01:50:00.972
Thank you.
- All right.

01:50:01.056 --> 01:50:03.959
Oh, now. We haven't
been introduced.

01:50:04.059 --> 01:50:07.103
Right. Well, this is Gavin.

01:50:07.187 --> 01:50:09.397
Hello, Gavin.
- My copper.

01:50:09.481 --> 01:50:11.507
And this is Natalie,
who's my, erm...

01:50:11.607 --> 01:50:13.327
who's my, erm,
catering manager.

01:50:13.427 --> 01:50:14.427
Oh.

01:50:14.527 --> 01:50:16.570
Hi.
- Catering manager.

01:50:16.654 --> 01:50:18.681
Watch he keeps
his hands off you.

01:50:18.781 --> 01:50:20.933
20 years ago, you'd
have been his type.

01:50:21.033 --> 01:50:24.057
I'll be very careful.
Don't try something, sir,

01:50:24.157 --> 01:50:25.938
just because it's Christmas.

01:50:26.038 --> 01:50:28.165
No, seriously.

01:50:28.249 --> 01:50:30.584
Come on.
Showtime. Quickly.

01:50:30.668 --> 01:50:33.279
Look, see you after, yeah?
- Probably.

01:50:33.379 --> 01:50:36.282
Thank you, Prime Minister.
- It's all right.

01:50:36.382 --> 01:50:38.551
Come on.
- Right.

01:50:38.634 --> 01:50:41.871
Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket

01:50:41.971 --> 01:50:46.559
Save it for a rainy day

01:50:46.642 --> 01:50:50.688
Catch a falling star
And put it in your pocket

01:50:50.771 --> 01:50:53.898
Never let it fade away

01:50:55.024 --> 01:50:59.070
Never let it fade away

01:50:59.737 --> 01:51:04.868
Never let it fade away...

01:51:12.542 --> 01:51:14.818
Hillier School would
now like to present...

01:51:14.918 --> 01:51:16.112
their Christmas number.

01:51:16.212 --> 01:51:19.115
Lead vocals by ten-year-old
Joanna Anderson,

01:51:19.215 --> 01:51:21.785
backing vocals
coordinated by her mother,

01:51:21.885 --> 01:51:24.078
the great Mrs
Jean Anderson.

01:51:24.178 --> 01:51:27.040
Erm, some of the staff
have decided to help out...

01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:31.643
and for this, we ask
you to forgive us.

01:51:31.727 --> 01:51:33.545
Thank you.

01:51:39.318 --> 01:51:42.888
I don't want
a lot for Christmas

01:51:42.988 --> 01:51:47.284
There's just
one thing I need

01:51:47.367 --> 01:51:50.662
I don't care
about the presents

01:51:50.746 --> 01:51:54.625
Underneath the
Christmas tree

01:51:54.708 --> 01:51:58.337
I just want you for my own

01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:02.216
More than you
could ever know

01:52:02.299 --> 01:52:06.220
Make my wish come true

01:52:06.303 --> 01:52:10.432
All I want for Christmas

01:52:10.515 --> 01:52:18.189
Is you

01:52:20.274 --> 01:52:22.844
I don't want a
lot for Christmas

01:52:22.944 --> 01:52:26.239
There's just
one thing I need

01:52:26.322 --> 01:52:29.283
I don't care
about the presents

01:52:29.367 --> 01:52:32.537
Underneath the
Christmas tree

01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:35.915
I just want you for my own

01:52:35.998 --> 01:52:38.918
More than you
could ever know

01:52:39.001 --> 01:52:42.088
Make my wish come true

01:52:42.171 --> 01:52:46.842
All I want for
Christmas is you

01:52:48.511 --> 01:52:50.805
You baby

01:52:50.888 --> 01:52:54.766
Oh, all the lights are shining

01:52:54.849 --> 01:52:58.937
So brightly everywhere

01:52:59.020 --> 01:53:01.658
And the sound of
children's laughter...

01:53:01.758 --> 01:53:02.758
fills the air

01:53:02.858 --> 01:53:05.235
Laughter fills the air

01:53:05.318 --> 01:53:08.238
Everyone is singing
Oh yeah

01:53:08.321 --> 01:53:10.682
I hear those sleigh
bells ringing

01:53:10.782 --> 01:53:13.587
Santa won't you
bring me my honey

01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:17.122
Won't you please
bring my baby to me

01:53:17.205 --> 01:53:20.125
I don't want a
lot for Christmas

01:53:20.208 --> 01:53:23.695
This is all I'm asking for
All I'm asking for

01:53:23.795 --> 01:53:26.715
I just wanna see my baby

01:53:26.798 --> 01:53:29.926
Standing right
outside my door

01:53:30.010 --> 01:53:32.678
Cos I just want
you for my own

01:53:32.761 --> 01:53:34.734
More than you
could ever know

01:53:34.834 --> 01:53:36.040
You will ever know

01:53:36.140 --> 01:53:39.476
Make my wish come true

01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:43.689
All I want for Christmas

01:53:43.772 --> 01:53:47.359
Is you

01:53:47.443 --> 01:53:49.737
All I want for Christmas

01:53:49.820 --> 01:53:53.324
And you and you

01:53:53.407 --> 01:53:56.722
And you and you
All I want for Christmas

01:53:57.203 --> 01:54:00.748
All I want for Christmas...

01:54:17.013 --> 01:54:19.013
Right.

01:54:21.976 --> 01:54:24.337
So, not quite as
secret as we'd hoped.

01:54:24.437 --> 01:54:26.689
What do we do now?
- Smile.

01:54:27.815 --> 01:54:29.859
Little bow.

01:54:33.279 --> 01:54:35.406
And a wave.

01:54:48.753 --> 01:54:51.947
Absolutely no idea.
I mean, can you imagine?

01:54:52.047 --> 01:54:54.116
I'll see you later, all right?

01:54:54.216 --> 01:54:56.343
I'll speak to you. Bye.

01:54:58.804 --> 01:55:01.495
Tell me, if you were
in my position,

01:55:01.595 --> 01:55:02.916
what would you do?

01:55:03.016 --> 01:55:05.060
What position is that?

01:55:05.143 --> 01:55:08.839
Imagine your husband
bought a gold necklace...

01:55:08.939 --> 01:55:12.009
and, come Christmas,
gave it to somebody else.

01:55:12.109 --> 01:55:13.109
Oh, Karen...

01:55:13.209 --> 01:55:14.845
Would you wait around
to find out...

01:55:14.945 --> 01:55:15.563
Good night.

01:55:15.663 --> 01:55:17.556
Night, darling.
Happy Christmas.

01:55:17.656 --> 01:55:19.316
Would you wait around
to find out...

01:55:19.416 --> 01:55:20.601
if it's just a necklace...

01:55:20.701 --> 01:55:23.061
or if it's sex
and a necklace...

01:55:23.161 --> 01:55:27.071
or if, worst of all, it's
a necklace and love?

01:55:28.125 --> 01:55:30.477
Would you stay?
Knowing life...

01:55:30.577 --> 01:55:33.237
would always be a
little bit worse?

01:55:33.337 --> 01:55:36.799
Or would you cut and run?
- Oh, God.

01:55:41.429 --> 01:55:44.223
I am so in the wrong.

01:55:44.307 --> 01:55:46.350
A classic fool.

01:55:46.434 --> 01:55:49.587
Yes, but you've also
made a fool out of me.

01:55:49.687 --> 01:55:53.172
You've made the life
I lead foolish, too.

01:55:54.942 --> 01:55:57.904
Darling. Ooh, darlings.

01:55:57.987 --> 01:56:01.157
Oh, you were wonderful.

01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:04.243
My little lobster,
you were so...

01:56:04.327 --> 01:56:06.621
What is that word?

01:56:06.704 --> 01:56:08.915
Orange.

01:56:08.998 --> 01:56:11.752
Come on, I've got
treats at home.

01:56:11.852 --> 01:56:13.443
Dad's coming.

01:56:13.543 --> 01:56:18.256
Sammy. Fantastic show.
Classic drumming, son.

01:56:18.340 --> 01:56:21.060
Thanks. Plan didn't
work, though.

01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:22.369
Tell her, then.

01:56:22.469 --> 01:56:24.329
Tell her what?
- That you love her.

01:56:24.429 --> 01:56:27.349
No way. Anyway,
they fly tonight.

01:56:27.432 --> 01:56:31.027
Even better. Sam, you've
got nothing to lose...

01:56:31.127 --> 01:56:34.256
and you'll always
regret it if you don't.

01:56:34.356 --> 01:56:36.550
I never told
your mum enough.

01:56:36.650 --> 01:56:39.384
I should have told
her every day...

01:56:39.484 --> 01:56:42.139
because she was
perfect every day.

01:56:42.239 --> 01:56:44.654
You've seen the
films, kiddo.

01:56:44.754 --> 01:56:47.219
It ain't over till it's over.

01:56:48.495 --> 01:56:51.486
OK, Dad. Let's do it.
Let's go get the shit...

01:56:51.586 --> 01:56:53.190
kicked out of us by love.

01:56:53.290 --> 01:56:55.584
Yes.

01:56:55.668 --> 01:56:58.048
Just give me one sec.
- Yeah.

01:56:59.547 --> 01:57:02.383
Oh, I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

01:57:02.466 --> 01:57:04.593
That's OK.

01:57:04.677 --> 01:57:08.097
My fault.
- No, no, really, it wasn't.

01:57:08.180 --> 01:57:11.058
You're Sam's
dad, aren't you?

01:57:11.141 --> 01:57:14.019
Yeah. Stepdad, actually.

01:57:14.103 --> 01:57:16.897
Daniel.
- I'm Carol.

01:57:16.981 --> 01:57:18.716
Carol.

01:57:18.816 --> 01:57:23.195
OK, I'm back. Let's go.
- Yeah. Well...

01:57:24.613 --> 01:57:26.891
I hope we'll meet
again, Karen.

01:57:26.991 --> 01:57:29.201
Carol...

01:57:30.578 --> 01:57:35.164
I'll make sure we do.
- Yeah? Good.

01:57:43.047 --> 01:57:45.091
Tell her.
- What?

01:57:45.174 --> 01:57:48.177
You know...
- Don't be such an arse.

01:57:51.848 --> 01:57:53.917
Look, there she is.
- Where?

01:57:54.017 --> 01:57:56.269
Over there.

01:57:58.146 --> 01:58:00.148
Oh, no.

01:58:01.274 --> 01:58:04.029
It's OK, we'll go
to the airport.

01:58:04.129 --> 01:58:06.129
I know a short cut.

01:58:19.458 --> 01:58:21.527
Good evening.

01:58:21.627 --> 01:58:24.630
Senhor Barros?
- Sim.

01:58:24.713 --> 01:58:28.383
I am here to ask
your daughter...

01:58:28.467 --> 01:58:30.369
for her hands in marriage.

01:58:30.469 --> 01:58:32.663
You want to marry
my daughter?

01:58:32.763 --> 01:58:34.623
Yes.

01:58:34.723 --> 01:58:36.125
Come here,

01:58:36.225 --> 01:58:38.520
there is a man at the door.

01:58:39.353 --> 01:58:41.522
He wants to marry you.

01:58:41.605 --> 01:58:42.923
But I've never
seen him before.

01:58:43.023 --> 01:58:44.383
Who cares?

01:58:44.483 --> 01:58:46.677
You're going to sell me
to a complete stranger?

01:58:46.777 --> 01:58:49.780
Sell? Who said
sell? I'll pay him.

01:58:49.863 --> 01:58:51.954
Pardon me. I'm meaning...

01:58:52.054 --> 01:58:54.604
your other daughter
- Aurelia.

01:58:54.659 --> 01:58:58.354
She's not here - she's
at work. I'll take you.

01:58:58.454 --> 01:58:59.897
You. Stay here.

01:58:59.997 --> 01:59:02.917
As if I would. Stupid.

01:59:05.878 --> 01:59:08.583
Father is about to
sell Aurelia...

01:59:08.683 --> 01:59:11.233
as a slave to
this Englishman.

01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:16.514
Wait. Wait.

01:59:19.892 --> 01:59:21.892
Oh, no.

01:59:22.812 --> 01:59:24.630
You better not
say yes, Father.

01:59:24.730 --> 01:59:27.692
Shut up, Miss
Dunkin' Donut 2003.

01:59:32.863 --> 01:59:34.890
Look, we're not
actually flying.

01:59:34.990 --> 01:59:36.433
You can't come through.

01:59:36.533 --> 01:59:39.557
Not even to let the
boy say goodbye...

01:59:39.657 --> 01:59:41.697
to the love of his life?

01:59:42.664 --> 01:59:44.664
No.

01:59:46.710 --> 01:59:49.880
I'm sorry, Sam.
- Boarding pass, sir?

01:59:49.963 --> 01:59:51.913
Just a moment, I
know I've got it.

01:59:52.013 --> 01:59:53.492
Would you hang on to that?

01:59:53.592 --> 01:59:55.594
Unless...
- What?

01:59:55.677 --> 01:59:57.330
Do you want to
make a run for it?

01:59:57.430 --> 01:59:58.205
Hold on to that.

01:59:58.305 --> 02:00:00.807
You think I should?
- Yeah.

02:00:01.474 --> 02:00:04.561
OK.
- Yes.

02:00:04.644 --> 02:00:06.530
I must have left them...

02:00:06.630 --> 02:00:09.605
where I was having
a cup of coffee.

02:01:21.845 --> 02:01:24.414
Apparently he is
going to kill Aurelia.

02:01:24.514 --> 02:01:26.683
Cool.

02:02:00.966 --> 02:02:03.010
Joanna.

02:02:04.094 --> 02:02:06.138
Sam?

02:02:09.391 --> 02:02:12.484
I thought you didn't
know my name.

02:02:12.584 --> 02:02:13.628
Course I do.

02:02:13.728 --> 02:02:17.398
Oh, Jesus. Here,
I've gotta run.

02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:11.358
Where is Aurelia?

02:03:11.458 --> 02:03:12.477
Why should I tell you?

02:03:12.577 --> 02:03:14.563
This man wants
to marry her.

02:03:14.663 --> 02:03:18.318
He can't do that -
she's our best waitress.

02:03:36.350 --> 02:03:38.350
Boa noite, Aurelia.

02:03:39.687 --> 02:03:41.730
Boa noite, Jamie.

02:03:57.079 --> 02:04:00.040
Beautiful Aurelia...

02:04:00.124 --> 02:04:04.295
I've come here with a
view to asking you...

02:04:05.421 --> 02:04:07.590
to marriage me.

02:04:08.966 --> 02:04:11.667
I know I seems an
insane person...

02:04:11.767 --> 02:04:14.232
because I hardly
knows you...

02:04:15.430 --> 02:04:22.395
but sometimes things
are so transparency,

02:04:23.730 --> 02:04:27.108
they don't need
evidential proof.

02:04:29.068 --> 02:04:31.327
And I will inhabit here,

02:04:31.427 --> 02:04:35.033
or you can inhabit
with me in England.

02:04:35.116 --> 02:04:37.602
Definitely go for
England, girl.

02:04:37.702 --> 02:04:39.750
You'll meet Prince William...

02:04:39.850 --> 02:04:41.898
then you can
marry him instead.

02:04:41.998 --> 02:04:45.505
Of course I don't
expecting you...

02:04:45.605 --> 02:04:47.962
to be as foolish as me,

02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:53.550
and of course I
prediction you say no...

02:04:54.676 --> 02:05:02.559
but it's Christmas
and I just wanted to... check.

02:05:06.813 --> 02:05:10.400
Oh, God - say yes,
you skinny moron.

02:05:13.237 --> 02:05:15.280
Thank you.

02:05:17.115 --> 02:05:19.159
That will be nice.

02:05:21.453 --> 02:05:24.206
Yes is being my answer.

02:05:25.916 --> 02:05:28.210
Easy question.

02:05:28.293 --> 02:05:30.696
What
did you say?

02:05:30.795 --> 02:05:32.321
Yes, of course.

02:05:34.924 --> 02:05:37.218
Bravo.

02:06:02.618 --> 02:06:05.168
You
learned English?

02:06:05.288 --> 02:06:07.456
Just in cases.

02:06:41.072 --> 02:06:43.867
I may not always love you

02:06:44.868 --> 02:06:48.330
But long as there are
stars above you...

02:06:48.413 --> 02:06:49.815
Hello, Daisy.

02:06:49.915 --> 02:06:52.833
This one's Greta.
- Hello, Greta.

02:06:52.917 --> 02:06:55.236
I'll make you so
sure about it...

02:06:55.336 --> 02:06:59.323
Here she is. This is Aurelia.
This is Juliet. This is Peter.

02:06:59.423 --> 02:07:02.535
Mark, didn't see you there.
- Just thought I'd tag along.

02:07:02.635 --> 02:07:05.538
Jamie's friends are
so good-looking.

02:07:05.638 --> 02:07:07.890
He never tells me this.

02:07:07.973 --> 02:07:09.073
I think maybe now

02:07:09.173 --> 02:07:11.085
I have made the
wrong choice,

02:07:11.185 --> 02:07:12.837
picked wrong Englishman.

02:07:12.937 --> 02:07:15.742
She can't speak
English properly.

02:07:16.023 --> 02:07:18.150
Dad. Dad.

02:07:20.361 --> 02:07:21.929
Oh, God.

02:07:22.029 --> 02:07:23.768
Did you get us
any presents?

02:07:23.868 --> 02:07:25.224
Matter of fact, I did.

02:07:25.324 --> 02:07:27.743
Thanks, Dad.

02:07:30.287 --> 02:07:33.373
How are you?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

02:07:35.458 --> 02:07:37.627
Good to have you back.

02:07:37.710 --> 02:07:40.088
Come on. Home.

02:07:42.882 --> 02:07:44.926
There she is.

02:07:46.344 --> 02:07:50.098
Hi.
- Hello.

02:07:50.181 --> 02:07:52.792
Aw, he should
have kissed her.

02:07:52.892 --> 02:07:54.892
No, that's cool.

02:07:56.229 --> 02:07:57.229
All right?

02:07:57.329 --> 02:07:59.716
Hey. What are you
two doing here?

02:07:59.816 --> 02:08:02.302
I might get a shag at last.
- Naughty.

02:08:02.402 --> 02:08:05.822
Got to go.
- Bye.

02:08:05.905 --> 02:08:07.905
Yahoo.

02:08:10.951 --> 02:08:13.370
Now, this is Harriet.

02:08:14.496 --> 02:08:17.595
Hi. Really pleased
to meet you.

02:08:17.695 --> 02:08:19.151
Hello, Harriet.

02:08:19.251 --> 02:08:21.071
I hope you don't mind,

02:08:21.171 --> 02:08:24.231
I sort of brought
my sister to stay.

02:08:24.882 --> 02:08:29.303
This is Carla.
She's real friendly.

02:08:29.386 --> 02:08:31.680
Hello, you must be Tony.

02:08:33.557 --> 02:08:35.626
I heard you were gorgeous.

02:08:35.726 --> 02:08:38.504
God only knows
what I'd be without you...

02:08:40.564 --> 02:08:44.234
God only knows what
I'd be without you

02:08:44.318 --> 02:08:47.863
God only knows
what I'd be without you...

02:08:47.946 --> 02:08:51.515
God, you weigh a lot.
- Oh, shut your face.

02:08:51.616 --> 02:08:54.510
God only knows what
I'd be without you

02:08:54.610 --> 02:08:55.645
God only knows

02:08:55.745 --> 02:09:02.449
God only knows what
I'd be without you

02:09:02.549 --> 02:09:03.528
God only knows

02:09:03.628 --> 02:09:10.545
God only knows what
I'd be without you

02:09:10.645 --> 02:09:11.702
God only knows

02:09:11.802 --> 02:09:18.345
God only knows what
I'd be without you

02:09:18.445 --> 02:09:19.502
God only knows

02:09:19.602 --> 02:09:26.295
God only knows what
I'd be without you

02:09:26.395 --> 02:09:27.385
God only knows

02:09:27.485 --> 02:09:34.294
God only knows what
I'd be without you

02:09:34.394 --> 02:09:35.350
God only knows

02:09:35.450 --> 02:09:42.133
God only knows what
I'd be without you

02:09:42.233 --> 02:09:43.233
God only knows

02:09:43.333 --> 02:09:50.037
God only knows what
I'd be without you

02:09:50.137 --> 02:09:51.116
God only knows

02:09:51.216 --> 02:09:56.304
God only knows what
I'd be without you...

02:10:15.239 --> 02:10:18.742
Love can be a many
splendored thing

02:10:18.826 --> 02:10:22.913
Can't deny the joy it brings

02:10:22.997 --> 02:10:26.375
A dozen roses,
diamond rings

02:10:26.458 --> 02:10:30.588
Dreams for sale
and fairy tales

02:10:30.671 --> 02:10:34.300
It'll make you
hear a symphony

02:10:34.383 --> 02:10:38.220
And you just want
the world to see

02:10:38.304 --> 02:10:41.932
But like a drug that
makes you blind

02:10:42.016 --> 02:10:44.268
It'll fool ya every time

02:10:44.351 --> 02:10:47.813
The trouble with love is

02:10:49.064 --> 02:10:53.151
It can tear you up inside

02:10:53.234 --> 02:10:57.113
Make your heart
believe a lie

02:10:57.197 --> 02:11:00.158
It's stronger than your pride

02:11:00.241 --> 02:11:04.496
The trouble with love is

02:11:04.579 --> 02:11:08.791
It doesn't care
how fast you fall

02:11:08.875 --> 02:11:12.545
And you can't
refuse the call

02:11:12.629 --> 02:11:15.673
See you got no say at all

02:11:17.717 --> 02:11:21.387
Now I was once a
fool, it's true

02:11:21.471 --> 02:11:25.475
I played the game
by all the rules

02:11:25.558 --> 02:11:28.853
But now my world's
a deeper blue

02:11:28.937 --> 02:11:32.272
I'm sadder but I'm wiser too

02:11:33.232 --> 02:11:36.401
I swore I'd never love again

02:11:37.194 --> 02:11:40.656
I swore my heart
would never mend

02:11:41.281 --> 02:11:44.576
Said love wasn't
worth the pain

02:11:44.660 --> 02:11:47.329
But then I hear
it call my name

02:11:47.412 --> 02:11:51.708
The trouble with love is

02:11:51.792 --> 02:11:55.754
It can tear you up inside

02:11:55.838 --> 02:11:59.633
Make your heart
believe a lie

02:11:59.716 --> 02:12:02.845
It's stronger than your pride

02:12:02.928 --> 02:12:07.349
The trouble with love is

02:12:07.432 --> 02:12:11.602
It doesn't care
how fast you fall

02:12:11.686 --> 02:12:15.189
And you can't
refuse the call

02:12:15.273 --> 02:12:18.234
See you got no say at all

02:12:20.987 --> 02:12:23.739
Every time I turn around

02:12:23.823 --> 02:12:27.410
I think I've got
it all figured out

02:12:27.493 --> 02:12:31.414
My heart keeps calling
And I keep on falling

02:12:31.497 --> 02:12:35.877
Over and over again

02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:39.964
The sad story always
ends the same

02:12:40.047 --> 02:12:42.842
Me standing in
the pouring rain

02:12:43.801 --> 02:12:46.804
It seems no
matter what I do

02:12:46.888 --> 02:12:49.682
It tears my heart in two

02:12:49.765 --> 02:12:54.769
The trouble with love is
The trouble with love

02:12:54.853 --> 02:12:58.507
It can tear you up inside
It can tear you up inside

02:12:58.607 --> 02:13:00.801
Make your heart
believe a lie

02:13:00.901 --> 02:13:03.095
Make your heart
believe a lie

02:13:03.195 --> 02:13:05.472
It's stronger than your pride

02:13:05.572 --> 02:13:07.452
The trouble with love is

02:13:07.552 --> 02:13:10.477
It's in your heart,
it's in your soul

02:13:10.577 --> 02:13:12.360
It doesn't care
how fast you fall

02:13:12.460 --> 02:13:13.855
You're losing that control

02:13:13.955 --> 02:13:17.918
And you can't
refuse the call

02:13:18.001 --> 02:13:21.004
See you got no say at all

02:13:21.087 --> 02:13:25.967
The trouble with love is
Ooh, yeah

02:13:26.051 --> 02:13:30.222
It can tear you up inside
Ooh...

02:13:37.436 --> 02:13:42.900
Your eyes tell me
how you want me

02:13:42.983 --> 02:13:46.403
I can feel it in
your heartbeat

02:13:46.487 --> 02:13:50.141
You're so excited
I can feel you getting hotter

02:13:50.241 --> 02:13:51.976
Oh baby

02:13:52.076 --> 02:13:56.705
I'll take you down,
I'll take you down

02:13:56.789 --> 02:13:59.191
Where no one's
ever gone before

02:13:59.291 --> 02:14:01.152
And if you want more

02:14:01.252 --> 02:14:05.339
If you want
more, more, more

02:14:05.422 --> 02:14:09.009
Then jump for my love

02:14:09.093 --> 02:14:10.827

And feel my touch

02:14:12.929 --> 02:14:13.929
Jump

02:14:14.029 --> 02:14:16.166

Then jump for my love

02:14:20.478 --> 02:14:21.478
I know my heart

02:14:21.578 --> 02:14:23.381
I know my heart
can make you happy

02:14:23.481 --> 02:14:24.481
Jump in

02:14:24.581 --> 02:14:27.051
