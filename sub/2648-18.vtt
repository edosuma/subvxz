01:52.488 --> 01:54.991
Yep. I'm not going over there.
That was fun.

They're onions.

20:02.744 --> 20:04.621
[ Claire ] Uh-huh. Okay.

20:07.332 --> 20:10.168
I used to be a fireman,
you know.

20:10.252 --> 20:11.795
I don't hurt kids.

20:14.715 --> 20:16.591
Sir, would you like
to come in?

20:17.884 --> 20:20.887
Just tell the boy that Shane
is on today at 3:00.

20:21.012 --> 20:23.724
He should watch it.
Maybe you could tell him yourself.

20:23.807 --> 20:26.017
He- He's right upstairs. Hang on.
Luke, honey, come on down.

20:26.101 --> 20:28.645
Your friend Walt is here.

20:28.770 --> 20:30.731
This is just so sweet.
Yeah.

20:30.814 --> 20:33.442
Well, just don't
start dancing.

20:33.525 --> 20:35.068
[ Mitchell ]
People can surprise you.

20:35.152 --> 20:39.448
You get used to thinking of them
one way, stuck in their roles.

20:39.531 --> 20:41.616
They are what they are.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.785
And then they do something
that shows you...

20:43.869 --> 20:47.998
there's all this depth and dimension
that you never knew existed.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.708
Are you talking
about Rob Lowe?

20:49.791 --> 20:51.835
I'm just saying
he's a very versatile actor.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.546
I think his good looks
have actually held him back.

20:54.629 --> 20:57.007
Well, I can relate
to that.

21:00.177 --> 21:02.053
[ Doorbell Rings]

21:02.179 --> 21:04.097
Haley!
We need to talk.

21:04.181 --> 21:08.185
I know I freaked out on you last night, but
you have to see it from my point of view.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.020
- You were totally spying on me.
- I know.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.647
You were invading my
First Amendment right to privacy.

21:12.731 --> 21:13.815
We were.

21:13.899 --> 21:16.026
I'm sick and tired of people
not trusting me!

21:16.151 --> 21:18.028
I get it.
And especially you guys.

21:18.111 --> 21:21.323
I don't think of you guys as my uncles.
I think of you as my friends.

21:21.406 --> 21:24.242
And if your friends don't believe
in you, then what else do you have?

21:24.326 --> 21:27.245
- Dylan's shoes.
- Please don't tell my mom.

21:28.497 --> 21:30.373
Buckle up.
