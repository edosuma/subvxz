00:04.745 --> 00:06.746
Shh.

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

00:22.271 --> 00:23.531
So, Mort, you ordered a small?

00:23.633 --> 00:25.835
How small was it?
What?

00:25.869 --> 00:27.353
Sorry, I'm taking
a stand-up comedy class.

00:27.387 --> 00:28.571
I think I did something wrong.

00:28.605 --> 00:30.072
I thought it was funny.

00:30.107 --> 00:32.341
Ugh, the ice cream
machine's stuck again.

00:32.392 --> 00:34.126
Hey, Mort, you're
getting a free medium--

00:34.161 --> 00:36.345
a free large--
a free extra large.

00:36.396 --> 00:37.396
Oh.

00:38.899 --> 00:40.166
You got to hit it just right, Dad.

00:41.318 --> 00:42.768
I said just right!

00:42.803 --> 00:45.871
Okay, kids, only one thing
to do: ice cream for brunch.

00:45.906 --> 00:47.740
TEDDY: Yay! Yeah, all right!
Yay, free ice cream!

00:47.774 --> 00:48.824
Yeah.

00:50.077 --> 00:51.193
Let's just unplug it.

00:51.228 --> 00:53.379
Reach behind there and grab the plug.

00:53.413 --> 00:54.713
I found my retainer.

00:54.748 --> 00:55.948
LINDA:
You don't wear a retainer.

00:55.982 --> 00:57.032
Oh, God, you're right!

00:57.067 --> 00:58.551
Get it out of my mouth!

00:58.585 --> 01:00.186
Never mind, I got it.

01:01.404 --> 01:03.305
Aw.
(door opens, bell jingles)

01:03.340 --> 01:06.408
Hi, Hugo, hope you're not here
for ice cream.

01:06.443 --> 01:07.610
I'm lactose intolerant, Linda.
Oh.

01:07.644 --> 01:09.211
I'm also intolerant

01:09.246 --> 01:12.565
of that suspicious-looking
bicycle outside, Bob.

01:12.599 --> 01:14.066
Uh, why are you telling me?

01:14.101 --> 01:15.801
Maybe it's because you're
the block captain.

01:15.836 --> 01:18.270
But you don't even live on this block.

01:18.305 --> 01:19.671
Well, I live in the quadrant

01:19.689 --> 01:21.240
and I happen to be the quadrant captain.

01:21.274 --> 01:23.309
Quadrant captain--
did you make that up?

01:23.343 --> 01:26.729
Did I make up these
quadrant captain business cards?

01:26.763 --> 01:28.347
Why would you do that?

01:28.381 --> 01:29.815
I didn't actually mean to.

01:29.850 --> 01:30.816
Well, pick them up.

01:30.851 --> 01:32.751
No, now stand down.

01:32.786 --> 01:34.587
That bike has been there for 24 hours

01:34.621 --> 01:35.821
and the seat's missing.

01:35.856 --> 01:37.256
It's clearly abandoned.

01:37.290 --> 01:38.657
Fine, I'll take care of it.

01:38.692 --> 01:41.293
Don't be block-cocky,
Bob, just do it.

01:41.328 --> 01:43.395
Jerk.
GENE: Nailed him.

01:45.499 --> 01:46.966
You trying to steal my bike?

01:47.000 --> 01:49.268
No, someone thought it was, um.

01:49.302 --> 01:50.302
It's mine.
Want to see the receipt?

01:50.337 --> 01:51.770
(farts)

01:51.805 --> 01:54.273
That's not a receipt.
Where do you shop?

01:54.307 --> 01:56.876
I really thought being
block captain would be more fun,

01:56.910 --> 01:59.345
like I'd have a gun
or a Taser or something.

01:59.379 --> 02:00.779
All I get is this whistle.

02:00.814 --> 02:02.114
Don't knock the whistle.

02:02.149 --> 02:04.550
Whistles stop hundreds
of crimes every year.

02:04.584 --> 02:06.218
And thousands of basketball plays.

02:06.253 --> 02:08.621
And they make dolphins jump
out of the water and eat fish.

02:08.655 --> 02:10.189
Dad, you could do that.

02:10.223 --> 02:13.492
Bob, I recall you raise
either chinchillas or children.

02:13.527 --> 02:14.493
Which is it?

02:14.528 --> 02:16.295
Uh, children.
Good.

02:16.329 --> 02:18.130
I'm focus-testing
some ideas.

02:18.165 --> 02:21.500
I need a new blockbuster
attraction at Wonder Wharf.

02:21.535 --> 02:24.537
Why don't you focus-test with
the kids down at Wonder Wharf?

02:24.571 --> 02:26.338
Those sheep?
I've already got their money.

02:26.373 --> 02:27.806
Besides, these children are

02:27.841 --> 02:29.975
a perfect cross-section
of American youth.

02:30.010 --> 02:32.211
Yeah-- boy, girl, and Tina.

02:32.245 --> 02:33.345
I'm a tastemaker.

02:33.380 --> 02:35.080
When I talk, people listen.

02:35.115 --> 02:36.582
Guys?

02:36.616 --> 02:37.883
Mr. Fischoeder,

02:37.918 --> 02:39.635
we're adrenaline junkies.
Oh.

02:39.669 --> 02:43.372
We like our rides pure, uncut,
and assembled in "MÃ©jico."

02:43.406 --> 02:46.408
I want something coming out
of here, here, and/or here.

02:46.443 --> 02:48.377
The three-hole standard
of excellence.

02:48.411 --> 02:50.262
Wait, walk me through the holes again.

02:50.297 --> 02:51.730
Let me throw some concepts at you.

02:51.765 --> 02:54.066
A bounce house full of jelly.

02:54.100 --> 02:55.568
Jam Slam!

02:55.602 --> 02:57.403
Try chutney.
Keep pitching, Barnum.

02:57.437 --> 02:59.855
Scare-ousel--
a carousel where you ride

02:59.890 --> 03:01.991
on real horse skeletons.

03:02.025 --> 03:05.027
You had me at "horse" but
lost me at "horse skeletons."

03:05.061 --> 03:06.662
You know, if you're looking
for an attraction,

03:06.696 --> 03:08.764
this town actually has
some interesting movie history.

03:08.798 --> 03:09.865
Hog Wash!

03:09.900 --> 03:11.250
Not you, Bob, it's an idea.

03:11.284 --> 03:12.451
Slide with the hogs.

03:12.485 --> 03:14.420
That's not bad.

03:14.454 --> 03:16.422
Yeah, well, seriously,
in the '80s, they shot

03:16.456 --> 03:18.290
one of those shark movies
right here in town--

03:18.325 --> 03:19.458
<i>The Deepening 3.</i>

03:19.476 --> 03:20.626
Oh, yeah, in 3-D.

03:20.660 --> 03:21.961
Right,

03:21.995 --> 03:24.530
<i>The Deepening</i>
<i>3D-eeepening.</i>

03:24.564 --> 03:26.699
Oh, that shark made me
so scared of the water,

03:26.733 --> 03:28.801
I spent the whole summer
standing up to pee.

03:28.835 --> 03:30.636
(chuckles) Then I got into the habit.

03:30.670 --> 03:31.637
I like it.

03:31.671 --> 03:33.205
There's your attraction.

03:33.240 --> 03:34.890
Teddy, you remember
<i>The Deepening,</i> right?

03:34.925 --> 03:36.692
Remember it?
I was in it.

03:36.726 --> 03:38.644
Some of us locals worked on that movie.

03:38.678 --> 03:40.462
I was Handsome Lifeguard #3.

03:40.497 --> 03:41.931
Really?
Seriously?

03:41.965 --> 03:43.399
Yeah, what?

03:43.433 --> 03:45.935
It's just, uh, you know,
we're looking at the "after."

03:45.969 --> 03:47.770
It's kind of hard
to picture the "before."

03:47.804 --> 03:49.104
Bob.
LOUISE: Guys,

03:49.139 --> 03:51.490
the shark is for sale.
What?! The shark?

03:51.524 --> 03:54.126
A prop house is selling
the actual mechanical shark

03:54.160 --> 03:55.127
and they're ready to deal.

03:55.161 --> 03:56.762
The actual shark?

03:56.796 --> 03:58.497
Oh, wow, Mr. Fischoeder,
you've got to get that shark.

03:58.531 --> 03:59.498
TEDDY:
Nah, don't,

03:59.532 --> 04:00.799
no, come on.

04:00.834 --> 04:02.434
Teddy, yes.
You worked on the movie,

04:02.469 --> 04:03.902
you should be excited about this.

04:03.937 --> 04:05.671
Yeah, but just not that shark.

04:05.705 --> 04:06.805
Why, Teddy?

04:06.840 --> 04:08.674
I don't want to talk about it.

04:08.708 --> 04:12.911
Okay, that's one vote for yes
and one cryptic vote for no.

04:12.946 --> 04:14.647
Let's run it past the focus group.

04:14.681 --> 04:17.016
Five-holer-- nostrils, too.

04:17.050 --> 04:18.617
Sounds like a winner.

04:18.652 --> 04:19.985
Noooo!

04:20.019 --> 04:21.754
Teddy, what is wrong with you?

04:21.788 --> 04:24.156
Uh, this ketchup is empty.

04:24.190 --> 04:25.924
Can I get a new ketchup, please?

04:25.959 --> 04:28.961
MORT: Some actor, this shark, a real ham.

04:28.995 --> 04:33.666
He chewed more scenery
than Nicolas Cage.

04:33.700 --> 04:36.635
He <i>really</i> chewed it...
with his shark teeth.

04:36.670 --> 04:37.703
(mic feedback screeches)

04:37.737 --> 04:39.138
Ha-ha-ha!

04:39.172 --> 04:40.723
(forced laughter)

04:40.757 --> 04:43.492
Ha, ha, ha!
Louise, stop.

04:43.526 --> 04:45.394
Mort the mortician, everybody.

04:45.428 --> 04:47.629
Hey, I see Bob Belcher.

04:47.664 --> 04:49.398
All this was his idea.

04:49.432 --> 04:50.399
I know what you're thinking.

04:50.433 --> 04:51.800
<i>That</i> guy?

04:51.835 --> 04:55.304
Yes, the guy with the, uh, food place.

04:55.338 --> 04:57.006
Thank you.
It's a restaurant.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.507
It's called Bob's...
Now...

04:58.541 --> 05:01.076
please welcome champion water skier

05:01.111 --> 05:04.713
and shark attack survivor
Kristi Sanducci.

05:04.748 --> 05:06.548
I'd like to thank the jackass

05:06.583 --> 05:09.318
who got
the left-handed scissors.

05:09.352 --> 05:10.753
Kristi Sanducci.

05:10.787 --> 05:12.571
Always professional.

05:12.605 --> 05:17.209
Now, the real star
of <i>The Deepening 3D-eeepening--</i>

05:17.243 --> 05:19.528
the... shark.

05:19.562 --> 05:22.064
BOB:
Whoo-hoo, shark, yeah!

05:23.533 --> 05:24.800
LINDA:
Ugh,

05:24.834 --> 05:26.702
someone has not aged well.

05:26.736 --> 05:27.903
What a butterface.

05:27.937 --> 05:29.038
We've filled her up with diesel,

05:29.072 --> 05:31.140
now let's see what she can do.

05:31.174 --> 05:33.342
(mechanical clicking)
TINA: It's waving at us.

05:33.376 --> 05:34.843
Hi.

05:34.878 --> 05:36.979
So that one does that.

05:37.013 --> 05:39.281
Let's see what this one does.

05:40.784 --> 05:42.201
(yells)

05:44.020 --> 05:45.571
Yes!

05:45.605 --> 05:46.705
Thank you, God.

05:48.475 --> 05:50.592
Woop, wrong one...
(stammering)... oh, here we...

05:50.627 --> 05:53.328
Oh, boy.
Yes, yes, all part of the fun.

05:53.380 --> 05:55.531
Can someone pass my arm back up here?

05:55.565 --> 05:57.066
Give me that, Louise--
we've got to give it back.

05:57.100 --> 05:58.500
No way! I caught it!

05:58.535 --> 06:00.102
It's like the bouquet at a wedding.

06:00.136 --> 06:01.570
I'm going to get bit next!

06:01.604 --> 06:02.588
You having fun?

06:02.622 --> 06:03.589
I wasn't-- I...

06:03.623 --> 06:04.740
(grunts) Ow.

06:04.774 --> 06:06.358
Wow, she's good with that thing.

06:06.393 --> 06:08.677
She can do that <i>and</i> park
anywhere she wants.

06:08.728 --> 06:09.711
(sighs)

06:12.082 --> 06:14.099
And so it begins.

06:18.731 --> 06:20.465
Why are we watching a
movie about a fake shark

06:20.500 --> 06:22.234
when we could be at Wonder Wharf

06:22.268 --> 06:24.369
standing next to the real fake shark?

06:24.403 --> 06:26.872
Because this is how I want
to remember the shark--

06:26.906 --> 06:29.374
in its prime, scaring the crap
out of Linda Blair.

06:29.408 --> 06:31.877
Fischoeder is crazy
to keep that thing going.

06:31.911 --> 06:33.612
After what happened to that girl's arm

06:33.646 --> 06:36.948
and that lady's poor dog
and that guy's balls--

06:36.983 --> 06:38.784
you know, the juggler.
Oh, yeah,

06:38.818 --> 06:40.452
Fischoeder's crazy to keep it going

06:40.486 --> 06:42.587
with all those people lining up,

06:42.622 --> 06:44.756
paying to see it, buying souvenirs.

06:44.791 --> 06:46.491
Nothing good can come from that shark.

06:46.526 --> 06:47.492
It's evil.

06:47.527 --> 06:49.060
Oh, there I am again.

06:49.095 --> 06:51.713
That's me in the red, white,
and blue trunks.

06:51.747 --> 06:53.482
What's everybody looking at?

06:53.516 --> 06:54.483
Nothing.
Nothing.

06:54.517 --> 06:55.817
Your body.

06:55.852 --> 06:57.152
Oh, my God, Linda Blair's boobs

06:57.186 --> 06:58.720
just popped out of her wet suit.

06:58.754 --> 07:00.222
Ooh! They're comin' at ya!

07:00.256 --> 07:02.324
Huh, this movie's a little bluer
than I remember.

07:02.358 --> 07:03.992
Let's get to a good part.

07:04.026 --> 07:05.327
(funky soundtrack playing)
Outdoor shower scene-- no.

07:05.361 --> 07:06.328
Yes.

07:06.362 --> 07:07.662
Topless car wash.

07:07.697 --> 07:08.930
Yes.
Tina, no.

07:08.965 --> 07:10.165
Nude hot tub-- no.

07:10.199 --> 07:11.299
Yes.
Oh, okay,

07:11.334 --> 07:12.634
here's some good clean shark.

07:12.668 --> 07:13.668
No.

07:13.703 --> 07:15.270
See that surfer getting eaten?

07:15.304 --> 07:16.271
I made out with her.

07:16.305 --> 07:17.506
She had her movie makeup on.

07:17.540 --> 07:18.907
Fake organs were coming out of her side.

07:18.941 --> 07:19.908
Pretty weird.

07:19.942 --> 07:21.343
The '80s-- am I right?

07:21.377 --> 07:22.761
You are not wrong.

07:22.795 --> 07:25.030
Why is the shark
attacking that submarine?

07:25.064 --> 07:27.465
The CIA is training sharks
to attack Soviet subs,

07:27.500 --> 07:29.034
and they're holding
the shark's baby hostage

07:29.068 --> 07:30.802
in the nude hot tub.

07:30.837 --> 07:34.289
So the shark isn't bad;
she's just protecting her baby.

07:34.323 --> 07:35.423
She's misunderstood.

07:35.458 --> 07:38.343
She just needs a friend.

07:38.377 --> 07:42.213
(soulful '80s-era pop ballad
melody playing)

07:48.521 --> 07:49.754
(deep belching)

07:51.000 --> 07:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:04.420 --> 08:05.654
It doesn't want to be here.

08:05.688 --> 08:07.122
This is exploitation.

08:07.156 --> 08:08.857
I'll show you exploitation.

08:08.891 --> 08:10.292
Go up there and get me that fin.

08:10.326 --> 08:11.293
You want her fin?

08:11.327 --> 08:12.694
I've got a guy.

08:12.728 --> 08:14.896
He wants it packed in ice
and on the next plane.

08:14.931 --> 08:16.665
Why does he want a mechanical shark fin?

08:16.699 --> 08:18.400
Mechanical shark fin soup.

08:18.434 --> 08:19.885
Mmm, that does sound good.

08:19.919 --> 08:21.019
Don't cut off her fin.

08:21.053 --> 08:22.304
It's her best feature.

08:22.355 --> 08:24.256
God, Tina, it'll grow back.

08:24.290 --> 08:25.523
Oh, yeah, cut it off.

08:30.196 --> 08:32.397
I'm bare-backing a shark.

08:32.431 --> 08:34.649
Come on, Gene,
chop-chop with the chop-chop.

08:34.683 --> 08:37.102
Whoa, it's tippy!

08:37.135 --> 08:39.738
Aah, no, Gene, get the fin!

08:44.560 --> 08:45.860
(screams)

08:47.246 --> 08:48.947
(Gene grunting)

08:48.965 --> 08:50.916
Are we safe here?

08:50.950 --> 08:52.350
Of course!
It's safety tape.

08:52.385 --> 08:53.919
They can't just call it that if it's...

08:53.953 --> 08:55.119
Aah!
Aah!

08:55.137 --> 08:57.289
Run, shark, run.

08:57.323 --> 08:59.224
We set it free.

08:59.258 --> 09:00.725
No, we didn't, we were never here.

09:00.760 --> 09:01.726
But we were.

09:01.761 --> 09:03.127
Remember right now?

09:03.145 --> 09:05.063
Yeah, okay, but you know
what I just remembered?

09:05.097 --> 09:06.097
We were never here.

09:06.131 --> 09:08.066
Oh, okay.

09:08.100 --> 09:11.019
(funky soundtrack playing)
Man, this movie is, like, 90% nude car wash.

09:11.070 --> 09:12.854
Bob,

09:12.888 --> 09:15.573
there's some kind of commotion
down at the Wonder Wharf.

09:18.344 --> 09:20.312
It's like the Running
of the Bulls but dumber.

09:20.346 --> 09:22.147
Yeah, but with a shark.

09:22.181 --> 09:24.382
Uh, yeah, it is a shark.

09:24.417 --> 09:25.550
Yeah, it's a shark.

09:25.584 --> 09:26.584
FISCHOEDER:
Nothing to worry about.

09:26.619 --> 09:28.153
Having a little shark problem.

09:28.187 --> 09:31.156
Uh, good time to grab a
hot dog or some popcorn.

09:32.124 --> 09:33.725
Oh, or a hot dog.

09:33.759 --> 09:35.593
Mr. Fischoeder,
enough's enough, right?

09:35.628 --> 09:37.262
You've got to shut off the shark, right?

09:37.296 --> 09:38.830
I mean, now.

09:38.864 --> 09:41.166
Shut it off? Oh, no, no,
I've got a packed park.

09:41.200 --> 09:44.069
I can't shut down my top attraction.

09:44.103 --> 09:45.637
I mean, I really can't.
That thing's on

09:45.671 --> 09:46.972
till it runs out of gas.

09:47.006 --> 09:48.006
But what if it breaks out
of Wonder Wharf?

09:48.040 --> 09:49.307
What happens then?

09:49.342 --> 09:51.843
Those are reinforced cement walls, Bob,

09:51.877 --> 09:54.112
built by somebody--

09:54.146 --> 09:56.414
proud immigrants, I guess, I don't...

09:56.449 --> 09:58.249
Wha...?
The shark fell over?

09:58.284 --> 09:59.918
That's crazy.

09:59.952 --> 10:01.686
We were at the library, right, guys?

10:01.721 --> 10:04.422
Yeah, exploring the wonderful
world of books and periodicals.

10:04.457 --> 10:05.423
Uh, yeah.

10:05.458 --> 10:06.992
And microfiche.

10:09.028 --> 10:10.528
Oh, no, no, no, no...

10:12.331 --> 10:14.032
(tires screeching)

10:15.701 --> 10:17.168
Crap.
Oh, my God!

10:17.203 --> 10:19.504
The shark's busted onto Ocean Avenue.

10:21.057 --> 10:22.140
This is my fault.

10:22.174 --> 10:23.541
I have to do something.

10:25.011 --> 10:25.960
What?

10:25.995 --> 10:28.163
I said, "This is my fault.

10:28.197 --> 10:29.330
I have to do something."

10:29.365 --> 10:31.116
Oh.

10:31.150 --> 10:32.884
Block Captain Bob.

10:32.918 --> 10:33.885
Yeah.

10:33.919 --> 10:35.920
(blowing weakly)

10:38.024 --> 10:40.025
God.

10:47.197 --> 10:49.431
On Ocean Avenue, local merchants fear

10:49.466 --> 10:51.324
they will become so much fish food,

10:51.414 --> 10:53.248
while police and
fire officials are caught

10:53.282 --> 10:55.533
in a surf-and-turf
battle.

10:55.568 --> 10:57.836
Meanwhile, local citizens
are taking matters

10:57.870 --> 10:59.337
into their own hands.

10:59.371 --> 11:01.022
The block captain has called

11:01.056 --> 11:03.825
an emergency, all-block,
shark-stopping meeting...

11:03.859 --> 11:05.059
(crashing)

11:05.094 --> 11:06.761
EDITH:
<i>That shark is ruining</i>

11:06.795 --> 11:08.663
my arts and crafts business!

11:08.697 --> 11:10.431
This town might do
all right without arts,

11:10.466 --> 11:11.933
but crafts?!

11:11.967 --> 11:13.768
Where the hell are we gonna be
without crafts?!

11:13.802 --> 11:15.703
Screw crafts!
What about my liquor store?

11:15.737 --> 11:16.704
Let me talk!

11:16.739 --> 11:18.406
Everybody, listen!
Calm down!

11:18.424 --> 11:19.774
You calm down!

11:19.808 --> 11:21.993
I lost a son!
Seriously?

11:22.027 --> 11:24.162
A sun quilt. It was beautiful.

11:24.196 --> 11:25.163
Listen,

11:25.197 --> 11:26.364
we're gonna solve this!

11:26.398 --> 11:27.866
Yes, let's listen to Bob.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.734
He's the idea man behind the shark.

11:29.768 --> 11:32.270
He pooh-poohed all my safety
concerns, by the way.

11:32.304 --> 11:33.771
What?
Thank you. I have to run.

11:33.806 --> 11:36.841
N-No, I said it might be cool
to get a mechanical shark.

11:36.876 --> 11:38.009
I didn't turn it loose.

11:38.043 --> 11:39.777
Yes, he did!
No, I didn't!

11:39.812 --> 11:41.079
Nobody knows who did!

11:41.113 --> 11:43.047
Yeah, stop this insane witch hunt!

11:43.082 --> 11:45.099
It could've been anyone
who wasn't at the library.

11:45.134 --> 11:46.201
The library?

11:46.235 --> 11:47.368
It's no use!

11:47.403 --> 11:48.469
They know we knocked the shark over!

11:48.504 --> 11:49.771
Wait, what? You did?

11:49.805 --> 11:52.373
No! That's just
an expression.

11:52.408 --> 11:54.609
Hey, did you knock over the shark today?

11:54.643 --> 11:55.944
You know I did!

11:55.978 --> 11:57.579
You're the family from hell!

11:57.613 --> 11:59.230
They're destroying the town!

11:59.265 --> 12:00.615
Let's have a town meeting

12:00.649 --> 12:02.283
to decide what to do with the Belchers!

12:02.318 --> 12:03.468
(screeching)

12:03.502 --> 12:09.140
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

12:10.342 --> 12:11.910
Teddy, what are you doing?

12:11.944 --> 12:12.977
I'm trying to get everyone's attention,

12:13.012 --> 12:14.145
but I don't have any nails.

12:14.179 --> 12:15.813
Okay, so what do you want to say?

12:15.848 --> 12:17.782
I have something to say.
Yes. What?

12:17.816 --> 12:19.584
I told you not to get that shark!

12:19.618 --> 12:21.069
I told you he was trouble!

12:21.103 --> 12:23.655
Now we need to join
together to stop him.

12:23.689 --> 12:25.006
Ow!
Don't you see?

12:25.040 --> 12:26.491
Us fighting with each other,

12:26.525 --> 12:28.243
that's what he wants!

12:28.277 --> 12:30.011
Ow! Teddy, stop!

12:30.045 --> 12:32.397
Yes, Teddy, thank you.
Thank you.

12:32.431 --> 12:36.000
So, yeah, we've got to join
together to stop the shark.

12:36.035 --> 12:37.802
Let's put our heads together, right?

12:37.836 --> 12:39.320
Block captain brainstorm.

12:39.355 --> 12:40.922
No bad ideas. Go.

12:40.956 --> 12:43.524
Topless car wash, like in the movie!

12:43.559 --> 12:44.509
Topless car...

12:44.543 --> 12:46.027
Don't write that down.

12:46.061 --> 12:48.529
Uh, Linda said there were
no bad ideas, Bob.

12:48.564 --> 12:50.031
Well, she was wrong, Hugo.

12:50.065 --> 12:51.199
(muttering):
Yes, like when she married you.

12:51.233 --> 12:52.267
What?
What?

12:52.301 --> 12:53.668
I heard you mutter something.

12:53.702 --> 12:54.969
Yes, and when someone mutters,

12:55.004 --> 12:56.371
that means they're
muttering to themself.

12:56.405 --> 12:58.039
(muttering): Huge mistake.
Well, I heard you.

12:58.073 --> 12:59.123
What?
I heard you mutter.

12:59.158 --> 13:00.375
Oh, really? What did I say?

13:00.409 --> 13:01.709
"Linda made a huge mistake."

13:01.744 --> 13:03.044
So we agree. Ha-ha.

13:03.078 --> 13:04.879
Someone else?
Listen to me.

13:04.913 --> 13:05.947
I know how the shark thinks.

13:05.981 --> 13:07.348
It's confused.

13:07.383 --> 13:08.650
It doesn't know why you want to kill it.

13:08.684 --> 13:09.884
It just wants to go home.

13:09.918 --> 13:11.152
Tina, it's a machine.

13:11.186 --> 13:12.620
It's dumber than our toaster.

13:12.655 --> 13:14.222
Our toaster is also confused.

13:14.256 --> 13:16.291
It doesn't know why we put bagels in it.

13:16.325 --> 13:17.492
Oh, my God.

13:17.526 --> 13:18.693
Okay,

13:18.727 --> 13:20.061
we got four good ideas.

13:20.095 --> 13:22.497
Well, four Hail Marys we could try.

13:22.531 --> 13:23.948
(chants):
Let's stop the shark!

13:23.983 --> 13:25.216
Or not.

13:25.250 --> 13:26.534
ALL: Let's stop the shark!
Or not!

13:26.568 --> 13:28.886
Let's stop the shark!
Or not.

13:28.921 --> 13:30.388
(mechanical whirring)

13:30.422 --> 13:32.173
(metal clanging)

13:32.207 --> 13:34.208
If a spike strip can stop
those drunk Shriners,

13:34.243 --> 13:35.994
it should be able to stop a shark.

13:36.028 --> 13:37.895
Here it comes!
Here it comes!

13:42.267 --> 13:43.685
Ouch.

13:43.719 --> 13:44.886
Okay, we've given the shark spikes.

13:44.920 --> 13:45.987
I knew that would happen.

13:46.021 --> 13:47.855
BOB:
That oil's gonna keep the shark

13:47.890 --> 13:50.224
from getting any traction.

13:53.028 --> 13:54.162
Ah...

13:54.196 --> 13:55.363
And we made it faster.

13:55.397 --> 13:56.964
Bravo, Bob!

13:59.952 --> 14:01.352
You want to catch a fish,

14:01.387 --> 14:03.054
you gotta think like a fisherman, right?

14:10.029 --> 14:12.280
Okay, now the shark is electrified!

14:12.314 --> 14:13.931
All you're doing is making the
shark more dangerous, Bob.

14:13.966 --> 14:15.850
I can see that, Hugo!
It was an FYI.

14:15.884 --> 14:18.419
Bob, the shark's getting pretty
close to our restaurant.

14:18.454 --> 14:20.121
It's all right.

14:20.155 --> 14:22.056
We've saved the best idea
for last: the big hole.

14:24.093 --> 14:26.244
Why'd we save our best idea for last?

14:26.278 --> 14:28.379
Because we didn't know
it was the best idea

14:28.414 --> 14:30.515
until the other ideas
were really terrible.

14:30.549 --> 14:31.916
Stupid.
Anyway,

14:31.950 --> 14:33.568
we dig a big hole, the shark falls in

14:33.602 --> 14:35.403
and hopefully, end of our problems.

14:35.437 --> 14:37.071
Beginning of China's problems!

14:37.106 --> 14:38.606
Sorry, China!

14:38.640 --> 14:40.491
They'll nail it.
They're really smart.

14:42.644 --> 14:44.545
LINDA:
Come on, keep going.

14:44.580 --> 14:46.381
Climb into your hole, you big mouse!

14:46.415 --> 14:48.082
(quietly):
Turn around! It's a trick!

14:53.021 --> 14:54.605
(cheering)

14:54.640 --> 14:56.374
Ah-ha-ha! You
did it, Bobby!

14:56.408 --> 14:57.775
The shark is gone!

14:57.810 --> 14:59.427
Gone, but not forgotten.

14:59.461 --> 15:00.995
Wait, what are we talking about again?

15:01.029 --> 15:03.147
Maybe you're not
such a horrible, greasy,

15:03.182 --> 15:06.818
perverted, shabby, two-bit,
filthy, disgusting pig.

15:06.852 --> 15:08.152
All right, thanks, thanks.

15:08.187 --> 15:09.153
(rumbling)

15:09.188 --> 15:10.788
What was that?

15:10.823 --> 15:12.290
That thing's still moving down there.

15:12.324 --> 15:13.491
But we buried it.

15:13.525 --> 15:15.410
(cracking, rumbling)

15:15.444 --> 15:18.062
I think it just ate its
way into our basement!

15:18.097 --> 15:19.414
(dramatic musical sting)

15:19.448 --> 15:20.948
Dad, can we keep it?

15:23.445 --> 15:25.146
The shark is in our basement?!

15:25.180 --> 15:26.814
Well, there's only one way
to find out for sure.

15:26.848 --> 15:28.649
Kids, stay here.
Duh.

15:28.684 --> 15:30.251
Yeah, I thought our basement was scary

15:30.285 --> 15:32.286
<i>before</i> it had a shark in it.

15:32.321 --> 15:34.438
Bob, stop. You've done
everything you can.

15:34.473 --> 15:35.873
You don't have to go down there.

15:35.907 --> 15:37.274
This whistle says I do.

15:37.309 --> 15:38.659
GENE:
That whistle blows!

15:38.694 --> 15:43.280
(blows raspberry)

15:43.315 --> 15:44.765
Enough talk.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.334
This ends now.

15:46.368 --> 15:47.702
Mort and I will go with you, Bob.

15:47.736 --> 15:49.603
What? Oh, I mean, yes!

15:49.638 --> 15:51.539
Thanks, guys.
That means a lot.

15:51.573 --> 15:52.690
Oh, good news, everyone!

15:52.708 --> 15:53.958
The dream team's on it!

15:53.992 --> 15:55.459
Ahab, Gray-hab,
and Flab-hab!

15:55.494 --> 15:57.361
You want to come, Hugo?

15:57.396 --> 15:58.963
No, I'm good.
Crowd control.

15:58.997 --> 16:00.981
Back up! Back up!

16:01.016 --> 16:03.117
Real quiet, all of a sudden.

16:03.151 --> 16:04.485
Quiet as a morgue.

16:04.519 --> 16:06.354
Morgues aren't all that quiet, actually.

16:06.388 --> 16:08.022
Maybe it finally ran out of gas.

16:08.056 --> 16:09.357
We could come back tomorrow.

16:09.391 --> 16:11.175
No! We gotta make
sure it's dead,

16:11.209 --> 16:12.793
and then we gotta cut
it up in little pieces

16:12.828 --> 16:14.512
so it never hurts anyone again!

16:14.546 --> 16:16.013
Whoa, Teddy, calm down.

16:16.048 --> 16:17.314
What happened with you
and that shark, anyway?

16:17.349 --> 16:18.983
Sorry, Bob.

16:19.017 --> 16:21.035
You see, It's personal
between me and this shark.

16:21.069 --> 16:22.370
We had a little run-in,

16:22.404 --> 16:24.238
back when I was working on that movie...

16:24.272 --> 16:27.024
<i>I was chatting up that cute surfer girl.</i>

16:27.058 --> 16:29.760
(distorted):
Ohh...!

16:29.795 --> 16:31.228
(snickering)

16:31.263 --> 16:32.596
(distorted):
Ugh!

16:32.631 --> 16:37.601
Well, you can forget
about getting any of this!

16:37.636 --> 16:39.437
<i>She could've been the one, Bob!</i>

16:39.471 --> 16:42.206
<i>I hit the craft service table</i>
<i>pretty hard after that.</i>

16:43.792 --> 16:45.676
That's when I started getting fat.

16:45.711 --> 16:47.111
Uh, I don't understand.

16:47.145 --> 16:48.946
Why aren't you mad
at the shark operator?

16:48.980 --> 16:50.948
Oh, yeah, that's a good point.

16:50.982 --> 16:52.850
No, no! The shark
drove him to it.

16:52.884 --> 16:54.685
It's evil, and now I'm fat.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.420
You're not that fat, Teddy.

16:56.455 --> 16:58.689
I'm wearing a guy girdle.
It's called a Boydle.

16:58.724 --> 17:00.057
Look at me. Look at me!

17:00.092 --> 17:03.060
Okay, Teddy... Well,
you know, look at <i>me.</i>

17:03.095 --> 17:05.262
(falsetto):
Hi, Teddy. I'm Bob's belly.

17:05.297 --> 17:06.747
(both laughing)

17:06.781 --> 17:09.450
Oh, you always know what to say, Bob.

17:09.483 --> 17:10.451
MORT:
Over here!

17:10.484 --> 17:12.269
I'm Mort's belly.

17:12.304 --> 17:14.204
Huh? What?

17:14.239 --> 17:15.806
We're not doing that bit anymore?

17:15.840 --> 17:17.875
What's going on in there?

17:17.909 --> 17:19.292
(rumbling)

17:19.327 --> 17:21.479
Did you guys hear that?

17:22.998 --> 17:25.983
(all yelling)

17:26.017 --> 17:27.984
Oh! We're gonna need
a bigger restaurant!

17:28.019 --> 17:29.820
Oh, come on.
Sorry.

17:29.855 --> 17:33.474
(all yelling)

17:33.508 --> 17:34.475
Hang on, Mort!

17:34.509 --> 17:35.926
(grunting)

17:35.960 --> 17:37.261
Not... fat... enough!

17:37.295 --> 17:38.395
(yelling)

17:38.430 --> 17:39.463
Mort!!

17:39.498 --> 17:40.781
No! I think
Mort got eaten.

17:40.816 --> 17:42.149
Oh, I should've laughed more

17:42.184 --> 17:43.934
at that belly-talking
thing he did.

17:43.969 --> 17:45.436
Mort, are you okay?!

17:47.155 --> 17:49.156
(Bob and Teddy yelling)

17:54.496 --> 17:57.815
I'm out! I'm literally
grasping at straws!

17:57.849 --> 17:59.850
(yelling)

17:59.885 --> 18:02.419
Ahh!

18:02.454 --> 18:04.121
Teddy, you're being crushed!

18:04.156 --> 18:06.791
No, my Boydle's protecting me,

18:06.825 --> 18:08.926
but I don't know how
long it's gonna hold!

18:08.960 --> 18:11.011
This is what you want, isn't it?!

18:11.046 --> 18:12.830
(hollow thudding) This is what you want!

18:12.848 --> 18:14.148
I'm torn.

18:14.182 --> 18:15.850
Dad raised me, but the shark gets me.

18:15.884 --> 18:17.868
If the shark eats our
restaurant, is he our new boss?

18:17.903 --> 18:18.919
Shark boss!

18:18.954 --> 18:20.170
(chomping noises)

18:20.188 --> 18:21.689
I'm blacking out, Bobby!

18:21.723 --> 18:23.858
I don't know how to stop it.
We've tried everything!

18:23.892 --> 18:25.476
It's too bad we can't
make it die from cancer,

18:25.510 --> 18:26.844
like in the movie.

18:26.878 --> 18:28.946
It didn't die from cancer, Teddy.

18:28.980 --> 18:30.648
Oh, no, you're right.

18:30.682 --> 18:31.982
They shot the cancer ending,
but it tested really bad.

18:32.017 --> 18:33.184
It didn't have the "pow."

18:33.218 --> 18:35.319
Really? Cancer? No pow?

18:35.353 --> 18:37.354
Yeah, they shot
a whole new ending, remember?

18:37.389 --> 18:39.323
They went and poured wet
cement down its throat.

18:39.357 --> 18:40.991
Yeah, and that would be really helpful

18:41.026 --> 18:42.893
if we had a cement mixer!

18:42.928 --> 18:44.128
(door bell tinkling) Maybe we do.

18:44.162 --> 18:46.564
The ice cream machine.

18:46.598 --> 18:47.948
She's right.

18:47.983 --> 18:49.183
We could fill up
the shark with ice cream.

18:49.217 --> 18:50.551
That might mess it up, right?

18:50.585 --> 18:52.319
I chose you, Dad.
Thanks, Tina.

18:52.354 --> 18:53.787
Over the shark.
Thanks.

18:53.822 --> 18:55.089
Because I thought...
Yes.

18:55.123 --> 18:56.957
Originally, it looked like maybe I would...
Yes.

18:56.992 --> 18:58.225
Oh.
Yeah, Dad,

18:58.260 --> 18:59.560
who was Tina really gonna choose?

18:59.594 --> 19:01.128
A broken-down wreck
with the dead eyes,

19:01.162 --> 19:02.229
or a fake shark?

19:02.264 --> 19:03.697
Aww...
You like that, Mom?

19:03.732 --> 19:04.832
Yeah.

19:04.866 --> 19:06.217
Okay, let's give it a try.

19:06.251 --> 19:07.518
All I have to do is plug it in.

19:07.552 --> 19:09.069
Ow! Hurry, Bob.

19:09.104 --> 19:10.905
Some of the teeth are
getting under the Boydle!

19:10.939 --> 19:12.389
(Bob groaning)

19:12.424 --> 19:13.557
Stretch, Bob!

19:13.592 --> 19:14.892
Stretch!

19:14.910 --> 19:16.093
You call that stretching?

19:16.127 --> 19:17.311
Got it!

19:17.345 --> 19:18.312
(shuddering)

19:18.346 --> 19:19.330
My feet are getting cold.

19:19.364 --> 19:20.664
Must be making ice cream.

19:20.699 --> 19:22.483
(grunting)

19:22.517 --> 19:23.584
Oh, my Boydle came off!

19:23.618 --> 19:24.735
You got my Boydle,

19:24.753 --> 19:26.537
but you don't got me, you shark!

19:26.571 --> 19:28.873
LINDA:
It's working!

19:28.907 --> 19:30.574
The shark's getting all logy!

19:34.896 --> 19:36.730
I've had dreams like this.

19:36.765 --> 19:38.499
It's over.
No, Bob.

19:38.533 --> 19:39.884
(yelling fiercely)

19:42.103 --> 19:45.022
Die! Die! Die!

19:45.056 --> 19:47.258
Now it's over.
No, it's not dead!

19:47.292 --> 19:49.026
Just kidding, everybody.
Just kidding.

19:49.060 --> 19:51.779
How shark was it?

19:51.813 --> 19:53.447
I still feel like I'm doing that wrong.

19:53.481 --> 19:55.082
(bell tinkling) Whoa, Bob!

19:55.116 --> 19:57.017
I love what you've done with the place.

19:57.052 --> 19:58.953
Listen, I'm gonna be
out of town for awhile,

19:58.987 --> 20:00.454
but, uh, keep it up.

20:00.488 --> 20:02.456
Uh, we-we should talk
about repairs for...

20:02.490 --> 20:04.124
No.
Okay.

20:04.159 --> 20:06.293
I'm going to miss you, shark.

20:06.328 --> 20:09.079
Hmm, I'm gonna miss you, too,
ice cream machine.

20:09.113 --> 20:11.382
He died the exact way I want to go:

20:11.416 --> 20:13.300
destroying the restaurant.

20:13.335 --> 20:14.768
Hey, how the hell

20:14.803 --> 20:16.637
are we gonna flush this
thing down the toilet?

20:16.671 --> 20:18.472
Whoa, somebody lost their Boydle!

20:18.506 --> 20:20.240
It's mine now.

20:20.275 --> 20:22.760
(grunting)

20:22.794 --> 20:24.979
Ah, my little Bobby Block Captain.

20:25.013 --> 20:26.330
You saved the town.

20:26.364 --> 20:27.631
Eh, just part of the job.

20:27.666 --> 20:28.999
GENE:
You're fired!

20:29.034 --> 20:31.135
I can't take credit
for everything, Olsen,

20:31.169 --> 20:32.832
but as quadrant captain, I will.

20:32.952 --> 20:35.186
You're welcome.
Who wants soup?
